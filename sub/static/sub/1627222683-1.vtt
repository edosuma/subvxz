WEBVTT

00:23.250 --> 00:24.833
You recording? ERIC: Yep.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.420
Okay, so basically we're
out in Itaewon right now.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.297
This is where the
Colosseum takes place.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.424
The underground fight
club we've been looking for.

00:31.716 --> 00:34.844
We're going to be walking
around Itaewon and see if there is

00:34.844 --> 00:37.013
anybody who can lead
us in the right direction.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.640
So let's head out.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.626
Yea I just followed my
friend but it was too brutal.

00:42.644 --> 00:44.229
So, I don't want
to go there again.

00:44.646 --> 00:47.399
Look for the guys'
that, you know.

00:47.399 --> 00:51.945
Around asking so many people about this.
Especially like, oh who told you by the way

01:01.121 --> 01:03.498
You have to have friends
to get into the dark web

01:03.540 --> 01:07.127
You have to already know the IP
addresses to get into the dark web.

01:07.127 --> 01:08.128
Then

01:10.213 --> 01:13.049
Yeah, there's all these
secret clubs societies.

01:20.223 --> 01:22.517
I'm just saying like when you
go out and ask people about

01:22.517 --> 01:23.968
a fight club you
gotta be careful.

01:24.010 --> 01:26.638
You're not sure what you
might get yourself into.

01:29.024 --> 01:30.041
What's the Colosseum?

01:30.608 --> 01:34.612
It's complex
intricate system that

01:35.238 --> 01:36.948
Will just continue to evolve.

01:37.115 --> 01:38.433
Hey welcome back this is Fonzo.

01:38.508 --> 01:43.680
I didn't sleep that well last night.
But there's a big reason why.

01:43.721 --> 01:48.685
And I can say that finally I got an
interview with him after more than a year.

01:48.726 --> 01:51.020
The one who invented
the Colosseum.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.238
Enjoy.

01:54.924 --> 01:56.209
Let's see how it's going to be.

01:58.136 --> 02:00.347
There he is. So just get ready.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.726
I'm gonna do you a favor here.

02:04.726 --> 02:06.644
I'm gonna do you a
real good favor here and

02:06.644 --> 02:07.720
I'm gonna tell you

02:07.812 --> 02:08.855
Oh, ok

02:09.647 --> 02:10.731
Yes.

02:10.807 --> 02:13.893
We are having an interview and

02:13.893 --> 02:14.894
You are?

02:14.894 --> 02:17.063
I'm Olga, nice to meet you.

02:21.743 --> 02:23.203
So this is all we have so far?

02:30.710 --> 02:31.728
What's up, everybody?

02:31.728 --> 02:34.022
My name is James Boss.

02:36.132 --> 02:40.011
So where do I where do I begin?

02:40.220 --> 02:45.517
I decided to document
this to show the world what it

02:45.517 --> 02:49.646
really means to pursue your
dream what it really means to

02:49.729 --> 02:55.735
take yourself and push
yourself to the edge to go as far

02:56.111 --> 02:57.128
as we can.

02:57.237 --> 02:59.072
You know, I don't
know what it's going to

02:59.114 --> 03:00.740
come out of this.

03:00.824 --> 03:03.910
I don't know what I'm gonna
be, you know filming what I'm

03:03.910 --> 03:06.746
going to be shooting but I
can assure you that it's gonna

03:06.746 --> 03:10.542
be an exciting journey. Martial
arts is something that I've

03:10.542 --> 03:11.626
always been pursuing.

03:12.043 --> 03:17.340
That's when I met Abel,
I met Pedro, I met Eric.

03:18.716 --> 03:21.236
It's probably they're probably
the reason why I'm still here.

03:21.428 --> 03:24.931
Yeah, we're just about to get some
training in ya know light workouts

03:24.931 --> 03:26.023
get in shape.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.143
So yeah, what's up I'm Pedro.

03:28.143 --> 03:30.311
Oh I came from South Africa.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.939
And right now I'm
living out here in Seoul.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.446
Hello my name is Abel Ryu.

03:39.446 --> 03:41.906
I'm from Seoul, South Korea.

03:41.906 --> 03:47.579
My goal is to be the
one. Nice to meet you.

03:50.665 --> 03:53.084
I'm Eric Park, I'm from Chicago.

03:53.793 --> 03:56.045
It's really finding who you are.

03:56.045 --> 03:59.424
Cause that’s all that matters
at the end of your life you know.

03:59.424 --> 04:01.718
Someone else cannot
live a life for you.

04:01.718 --> 04:04.415
I actually find it really
disrespectful when

04:04.439 --> 04:07.515
people kinda condescend
like my life direction.

04:07.515 --> 04:12.645
Typical life of go to a good
University get a good degree.

04:13.313 --> 04:15.148
AAhhhhh!!

04:15.356 --> 04:17.066
My day to day job again.

04:17.442 --> 04:20.236
Yeah, I don't think this
is really my environment.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.446
I don't really belong here.

04:21.529 --> 04:26.618
I saw Bruce Wayne and you
know, I saw Batman and how huge

04:26.618 --> 04:30.205
and jacked he was and I was like,
you know, I want to be like that guy.

04:44.886 --> 04:48.014
JAMES: A lot of people,
they focus on offense.

04:48.014 --> 04:52.281
PEDRO: Yea JAMES: They always
wanna hit harder come in stronger.

04:52.435 --> 04:54.521
JAMES: Defense is
probably more important.

04:54.521 --> 04:57.732
That’s the reason why
Mayweather is undefeated.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.835
PEDRO: Either wear out,
or they're gonna slip up and

04:59.859 --> 05:02.111
there's gonna be an opening.
And then we gonna catch 'em.

05:02.211 --> 05:03.262
One, two, three.

05:03.312 --> 05:06.149
Have proper distance
to be aware of

05:06.824 --> 05:09.327
Right here he can attack me.
Right here then I can hit him

05:09.827 --> 05:11.454
Or I can keep moving.

05:16.918 --> 05:17.919
ABEL: Woah!

05:44.988 --> 05:48.741
This is who I am and I can't
feel bad just to be who I am.

05:48.908 --> 05:55.164
But another side of me is kind of
like can I take on this responsibility?

05:55.456 --> 05:59.919
I think we've got about
two months..two months left.

06:00.378 --> 06:04.215
left to just practice and
try to find a Fight Club.

06:04.549 --> 06:08.636
I know it's a it's not the ideal
situation for us to be practicing

06:08.636 --> 06:11.598
because we don't
have a dojo or anything

06:11.723 --> 06:13.808
We gotta do what we gotta do so.

06:13.850 --> 06:15.643
One, two, three. Fighting! Yea!

06:22.233 --> 06:24.360
Oh hi, how are you!

06:24.360 --> 06:25.361
JAMES: Good good.

06:25.361 --> 06:26.362
JAMES: Long time no see

06:27.322 --> 06:28.397
You doing well?

06:28.397 --> 06:29.473
JAMES: Yea I'm doing good.

06:30.783 --> 06:33.161
I think you're a
bit early but yea.

06:33.578 --> 06:34.587
Let's go.

06:34.654 --> 06:35.746
JAMES: Yea

06:36.289 --> 06:37.915
So that's the place.

06:39.334 --> 06:42.086
I think it's better I
go first, talk to him.

06:55.433 --> 06:59.020
So it's it's pretty expensive
like my services cost money.

06:59.646 --> 07:04.359
But like if you have enough money,
I can become your personal spy

07:05.109 --> 07:06.127
If you need it.

07:10.114 --> 07:14.827
So the cheapest thing the
minimum so it starts like from

07:14.827 --> 07:16.245
0.2 BTC.

07:16.829 --> 07:20.124
It's like for tracking
people then it goes up.

07:20.249 --> 07:23.920
Like I can tell you how much
money people have on the bank

07:23.920 --> 07:27.548
accounts like, you know,
everybody is using internet banking

07:27.548 --> 07:28.632
these days.

07:29.817 --> 07:33.613
I can tell you like really
personal information about people.

07:34.247 --> 07:37.542
I can snatch some files from
the personal computers right?

07:37.642 --> 07:42.814
So if you if you decide to
contact me, this is how you can

07:42.814 --> 07:43.856
contact me.

07:51.197 --> 07:53.116
Guys too slow!

07:58.413 --> 07:59.914
ABEL: Hurry up! Hurry up!

08:01.541 --> 08:02.959
ABEL: James! Pedro!

08:02.959 --> 08:04.085
ABEL: 1, 2, 1, 2!

08:04.335 --> 08:05.744
Let me hold the camera. ABEL: Ok

08:06.212 --> 08:07.763
PEDRO: James hold
up! JAMES: Yea yea

08:09.298 --> 08:10.357
ABEL: Whoo!

08:18.975 --> 08:21.642
ERIC: What the fuck, yo what
the f.. PEDRO: Yo, check that out.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.604
JAMES: Hey!

08:28.443 --> 08:30.403
ERIC: Hey! Stop stop stop stop!

08:33.865 --> 08:35.074
ERIC: Stop stop stop

08:35.742 --> 08:36.767
ERIC: Oh shit

08:36.801 --> 08:38.553
ERIC: Hey hey hey,
don't touch that shit.

08:39.537 --> 08:40.713
ERIC: Get off, get off

08:43.541 --> 08:44.542
ABEL: Help!

08:47.462 --> 08:48.563
JAMES: No just get him out

08:50.965 --> 08:51.966
HOOLIGAN: Let me go!

08:52.717 --> 08:53.734
PEDRO: backup!

09:10.902 --> 09:12.628
Get him out of here,
get him out of here!

09:12.628 --> 09:13.796
ERIC: Hey hey, move!

09:20.787 --> 09:22.413
HOOLIGAN: Hey, bring him here!

09:29.921 --> 09:32.006
JAMES: Make sure
they're not following us.

10:08.584 --> 10:13.172
We did meet a person named X

10:13.172 --> 10:16.843
and he said that he can give
us information but we have to

10:16.843 --> 10:20.346
pay him and I think he's kind
of expensive I think maybe

10:20.346 --> 10:24.809
we can survive for like a month
or month and a half maybe.

10:27.144 --> 10:29.480
And then we have to go
back to working, you know.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.317
Yo what about the guy we saw at
the forest who was filming also like.

10:33.317 --> 10:34.377
What about him.

10:34.527 --> 10:37.405
I mean, he said he knows some
stuff about the dark web too.

10:37.947 --> 10:38.947
Oh, okay.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.534
Maybe I could try
to talk to him or

10:42.118 --> 10:43.953
he might have some connections.

10:43.953 --> 10:45.154
I mean, I don't trust him.

10:45.288 --> 10:46.539
JAMES: Abel, I understand.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.165
Yeah, I'm a little bit worried.

10:48.165 --> 10:51.752
We got..we can just wait.
We still have a month ok.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.796
PEDRO: Noo…our
money is going down.

10:54.130 --> 10:57.341
Well, it is going down but I'm
saying we can try to get more

10:57.341 --> 10:58.968
information because

10:58.968 --> 11:00.803
We just get information
from him and

11:00.845 --> 11:04.515
then we just leave
that's it just information.

11:04.515 --> 11:05.725
That's all that's all we need.

11:05.725 --> 11:06.725
Right?

11:06.742 --> 11:08.828
So maybe Pedro
can set up a meeting.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.183
ERIC: Abel wake up.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.086
Yea she was training
heavily the other day.

12:15.628 --> 12:18.214
Yeah every day every day.

12:18.214 --> 12:19.214
Yeah.

12:29.392 --> 12:30.718
PEDRO: Do you
guys work together?

12:35.523 --> 12:37.083
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

12:44.865 --> 12:45.933
Sales.

12:45.941 --> 12:47.276
JAMES: Sales? Oh.

12:56.168 --> 12:57.169
PEDRO: Long time.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.170
Long time?

13:16.022 --> 13:17.056
Nice meeting you.

14:26.092 --> 14:29.220
So it's erased so that we
don't go to jail. Or anything.

14:29.220 --> 14:30.887
Yea pretty much.
Yea it's uh..yea.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.600
I don't know man,
it's a big deal.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.937
There's like 3, 4, 5
things going on at once.

15:31.949 --> 15:33.033
You ready Abel?

15:33.617 --> 15:35.619
Yea I think Abel
can handle. Yea.

16:42.311 --> 16:46.148
Okay, let's make
a promotion trailer.

16:46.815 --> 16:49.735
My name is Dana and
I'm a film school student.

16:52.738 --> 16:57.743
I will shoot short film.

17:02.248 --> 17:03.323
Ready?

17:03.874 --> 17:04.875
ERIC: Let's do this.

17:18.973 --> 17:19.974
Pedro is runnin'.

17:22.518 --> 17:23.811
Oh, yeah, Pedro run.

17:26.939 --> 17:28.015
No, no.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.483
No, it wasn't.

17:32.027 --> 17:36.824
Sorry Pedro! Was me but
you know miscommunication.

17:36.824 --> 17:37.825
It happens all the time.

17:37.825 --> 17:40.619
So remember last
time I was sweating.

17:40.828 --> 17:43.664
I'm going to make him
sweat, you know. Ready?!

17:45.249 --> 17:46.308
No, not yet.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.711
I want to see more
action, you know.

18:06.937 --> 18:07.938
Okay?

18:33.839 --> 18:35.132
Oh yea!

18:35.132 --> 18:36.733
You know when Pedro
was runnin down hill.

18:36.733 --> 18:38.385
He was like 'oh my
knee's my knee's.

18:58.155 --> 18:59.323
Yes!

18:59.698 --> 19:00.699
Kung fu.

19:02.910 --> 19:03.911
It's me!

19:24.973 --> 19:26.475
For sure. Woo!

19:52.709 --> 19:54.627
Good. Cool It's looking good Yea

19:54.711 --> 19:56.046
It's just the first video.

19:56.338 --> 19:59.341
Yea I mean, I think,
let's upload this and

19:59.925 --> 20:00.926
Let's see.

20:01.427 --> 20:04.930
If we can get a fight. Do you think
people will actually like

20:05.055 --> 20:09.560
Yea how do you think the people at the
Colosseum would think after watching this.

20:10.519 --> 20:14.606
Do you think they will be
scared? To tell you the truth. I think

20:16.108 --> 20:19.319
Are we making us look tough
and so that they want to challenge us

20:19.319 --> 20:23.449
or we look just okay to
fight so that they're like yeah

20:23.449 --> 20:25.826
I can win this guy and
then you know make us

20:25.826 --> 20:28.745
I think like from watching
the videos we look kind of

20:28.745 --> 20:31.623
tough but not super tough.
Yeah.

20:31.623 --> 20:32.624
That might be good

20:32.833 --> 20:34.710
Yea that's a good thing

20:34.710 --> 20:41.216
I think they will underestimate us
yeah so. Let's upload this and let's

20:41.216 --> 20:45.971
see let's see if we could get a
fight going. Okay all right. Cool.

20:46.221 --> 20:50.184
From the outside, it may sound
crazy. From the outside looking in

20:50.184 --> 20:52.227
you may look somebody
and think they are crazy.

20:52.603 --> 20:55.105
But we live in a world that is

20:56.899 --> 21:00.486
skewed. stacked
against people like me.

21:02.154 --> 21:04.615
But I've created a world
of my own right now.

21:06.325 --> 21:09.411
Where I can live, walk and
roam free and do what I will.

21:10.245 --> 21:11.538
I set the rules.

21:11.747 --> 21:13.540
It's my universe my kingdom.

21:14.416 --> 21:16.502
I'm Thanos here, I
can do whatever I want.

21:16.752 --> 21:17.753
I had basic

21:18.712 --> 21:21.840
programming skills that
helped me out of the beginning.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.009
But other than that.

21:25.511 --> 21:29.640
The tough thing was basically
getting the first few fights.

21:29.932 --> 21:31.808
And then getting people to bet.

21:33.227 --> 21:34.811
Finding big rollers.

21:34.811 --> 21:37.940
That was one of the key things
so I had to keep team pretty

21:37.940 --> 21:42.110
small to begin with and then
after a few things happened,

21:42.110 --> 21:43.111
you know.

21:44.947 --> 21:47.241
News began to spread
on the the dark web.

21:53.622 --> 21:55.322
Okay. We got one minute.

21:59.753 --> 22:00.879
My mask.

22:06.260 --> 22:08.011
Do I look, do I
look kinda weird?

22:09.346 --> 22:11.139
All right, let's try this.

22:17.646 --> 22:18.822
What's going on?

22:21.441 --> 22:22.534
What is this?

22:23.318 --> 22:29.032
What's what's what we're
supposed to talk about the fight.

22:29.032 --> 22:30.216
Yeah. Yeah.

22:30.242 --> 22:33.620
Yeah Soowoo referred
me to you, but look.

22:34.913 --> 22:38.625
You know this whole this
whole thing is based on trust right

22:38.625 --> 22:40.210
now. I'm showing you my face.

22:41.545 --> 22:42.637
Yeah, right, man.

22:42.729 --> 22:43.821
Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.847 --> 22:45.640
Yeah you want you
want to do this or not?

22:45.640 --> 22:47.225
I'm... All right.

22:47.426 --> 22:48.435
Anyway.

22:48.518 --> 22:51.847
Yeah, so I saw some of your
trailers Soowoo showed me some of

22:51.847 --> 22:54.808
your trailers and I don't know
if I can work with that man.

22:54.808 --> 22:58.020
I mean, they're cool and
everything but you know,

22:58.020 --> 23:00.814
it's not a movie that
you're making right?

23:01.148 --> 23:05.944
Yeah me that's it's it's what
we were able to work with right

23:05.944 --> 23:08.739
now at this moment, but you
know, we've been we've been ready

23:08.739 --> 23:09.823
for this all our lives.

23:10.032 --> 23:11.049
You have to

23:11.325 --> 23:14.328
You got a day job you
and your friends got like

23:14.745 --> 23:15.829
day jobs and stuff.

23:16.622 --> 23:17.631
Not anymore.

23:17.631 --> 23:20.417
No, I mean we're
like we're all in.

23:20.417 --> 23:21.543
We're all in this man.

23:21.627 --> 23:24.338
We just need our first break.

23:24.630 --> 23:29.384
So looking for a promoter who
can put this together, you know.

23:30.010 --> 23:31.136
Oh wow.

23:31.345 --> 23:32.428
Oh wow. All right.

23:33.138 --> 23:34.640
No, I know I got it.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.715
I got it.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.008
You know, I was there too.

23:37.017 --> 23:39.728
You know how it
works is the fighters

23:39.728 --> 23:41.654
JAMES: So the way that
this game works. ERIC: Yea

23:41.655 --> 23:43.500
JAMES: I just found out
yesterday while talking

23:43.524 --> 23:45.167
to one of the guys,
one of the managers.

23:45.208 --> 23:50.614
ERIC: Okay JAMES: Is there's,
so people who are betting online

23:50.614 --> 23:54.910
they can make around
twice, two times what they bet.

23:54.910 --> 24:01.208
But people who are fighting, we
invest our own money in the fight

24:01.291 --> 24:07.047
We invest in ourselves, but if we win,
we can win up to 10 times what we invest.

24:07.047 --> 24:09.091
So the way I calculated it

24:09.132 --> 24:11.093
is we have

24:12.761 --> 24:14.137
$2,000 right now.

24:14.221 --> 24:17.641
Yeah, this is our money,
right if we win our first fight

24:17.724 --> 24:21.019
we turn that into $20,000.

24:21.144 --> 24:23.814
Yeah, right then from here.

24:23.939 --> 24:26.316
So I'm trying to play safe so
we don't lose too much money.

24:26.733 --> 24:31.113
And that will give us a
total of 4 million dollars.

24:34.032 --> 24:37.119
So that's one two,
three, four five fights.

24:37.327 --> 24:42.916
We have four million dollars
and each of us can leave this

24:42.916 --> 24:44.209
game with a million dollars.

24:44.209 --> 24:46.336
So one mill each.

24:46.336 --> 24:51.133
Wow, what do you think Pedro,
you down, it's a million dollars each.

24:51.133 --> 24:54.720
That's that's that's pretty much.
Dude 5 fights and you

24:54.720 --> 24:59.808
have a million dollar in
your pocket Just five fights?

25:00.225 --> 25:03.478
one, two, three, four five, but
we have to win all of these fights.

25:03.645 --> 25:05.439
Can you win. Wow, I'm gonna win.

25:05.522 --> 25:06.614
Yes.

25:07.232 --> 25:10.819
But just know that you lose a fight
you don't walk away with anything.

25:11.403 --> 25:13.530
I see all or nothing.

25:14.322 --> 25:15.323
It is all or nothing.

25:16.241 --> 25:17.743
So do what you got to do buddy.

25:21.538 --> 25:25.167
Ha hah, I'm here, Nasiir
Hamad. Alhamdulillah

25:25.208 --> 25:26.217

25:27.327 --> 25:29.746

25:38.847 --> 25:40.849

25:40.849 --> 25:42.726
Now, you're gonna
find a real man for once.

25:42.726 --> 25:43.935
It's not business.

25:44.311 --> 25:47.130
This is real men
struggle now and nothing can happen.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.223
If God is with me.

25:48.315 --> 25:49.332
Nothing can happen.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.443
Nothing can bad happen to me.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.946
Nobody can broke me. I can
broke everybody with the real will.

25:55.238 --> 25:57.616
I'm gonna show you that I'm
fearless you're gonna see that

25:57.616 --> 26:00.035
soon. I don't have
any fear from anyone.

26:01.244 --> 26:02.304
Fucking bitch.

26:52.838 --> 26:55.632
JAMES: Nasiir he has
really good boxing skills.

26:56.049 --> 27:00.136
JAMES: When he throws kicks, it's usually
jump kicks or kinda like flashy kicks.

27:00.136 --> 27:03.181
PEDRO: Yeah JAMES:He kind of
seems to neglect below the waist.

27:03.849 --> 27:06.226
JAMES: And he doesn't
seem to guard himself very well.

27:06.226 --> 27:07.427
Let's say this is his thigh.

27:09.312 --> 27:11.898
And then suddenly
PEDRO: And then I move up?

27:11.982 --> 27:14.309
Yea you move up. Boom boom
boom, keep attacking his head.

27:14.376 --> 27:16.419
PEDRO: I think cause I
have a reach advantage too.

27:16.503 --> 27:18.738
I can keep him at
Bay by throwing kicks.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.115
He tries to come too close.

27:20.115 --> 27:22.325
And working at close range.

27:22.617 --> 27:23.927
I can just keep throwing kicks.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.040
Arm out and then go in.

27:49.686 --> 27:53.231
Boom you grab him,
boom you elbow him.

27:59.029 --> 28:00.121
Okay one more.

28:01.448 --> 28:02.449
It's just familiarity.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.452
Familiar with stuff.

28:25.013 --> 28:29.226
Basically, we've been
waiting for this moment and I'm not

28:29.726 --> 28:34.522
good at these motivational
speeches, but basically let's

28:35.231 --> 28:39.319
stick to the plan and
let's make it happen.

28:39.319 --> 28:40.528
Just don't get injured.

28:40.737 --> 28:45.492
Don't get exhausted stay focused
and I know you guys could do it.

28:46.284 --> 28:47.911
You want to say anything Eric?

28:48.578 --> 28:49.579
You know

28:50.956 --> 28:53.333
Bruce Lee once said
be like water right?

28:54.334 --> 28:56.211
You know, we're so
much more than water.

28:56.544 --> 28:59.214
So let's just be
better than the water.

28:59.714 --> 29:02.217
Yeah, and then
better than Bruce Lee.

29:02.217 --> 29:04.717
You
can do this. Alight let's do it.

29:04.803 --> 29:06.721
Eric and I we're
going to be in the car.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.224
We're gonna be watching,
because they don't let us

29:09.224 --> 29:10.725
see the fight if
we're not fighting.

29:10.809 --> 29:13.645
Yeah, so good luck guys.

29:13.937 --> 29:15.029

29:15.113 --> 29:17.615

two three fighting!

29:28.034 --> 29:29.536

29:39.129 --> 29:40.213
Let's go to the car.

29:40.338 --> 29:41.430
Okay.

29:43.466 --> 29:48.596
Let's gather our
energy before the fight.

29:55.311 --> 29:56.312
Go Abel

30:15.331 --> 30:16.332
Oh! Did you see that?

30:36.436 --> 30:37.729
Dude that was so

30:37.729 --> 30:38.746
Oh, that was clean.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.286
Ahh, Pedro!

30:53.536 --> 30:54.662

30:55.663 --> 30:56.664
Step out step out!

30:56.664 --> 30:57.665
Step out!

30:57.665 --> 30:58.666
C'mon man

30:58.666 --> 30:59.667
Let's go

31:10.637 --> 31:11.729
Come on.

31:17.811 --> 31:18.861
Oh shit!

31:39.666 --> 31:44.337
Yes, that's what I'm talking
about yes, clean shot.

31:45.672 --> 31:46.673
Oh shit.

34:22.912 --> 34:23.930
Okay, take a break.

34:24.013 --> 34:25.014
It's ok harder harder.

34:25.415 --> 34:27.632
I don't wanna, no I don't
want to. It's ok I got it.

34:27.709 --> 34:28.718
All right.

34:28.718 --> 34:32.013
Well, he said it
right I'm going.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.131
Ready.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.922
I think you need to duck
your head a little more.

34:46.644 --> 34:48.503
And then he's gonna
throw a couple punches.

34:48.938 --> 34:49.939
Yea like that.

34:56.446 --> 34:57.447
Stun, knock out

35:01.617 --> 35:03.494
I'm gonna go boxing.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.165
And then throw
the kicks in later.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.043
And hopefully I could get him
off guard and get like a nice

35:10.043 --> 35:11.044
kick to the face.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.615
He's usually more with his
hands and I think I should be good.

35:21.679 --> 35:22.930
JAMES: How do you feel Eric?

35:23.431 --> 35:24.432
I'm good man.

35:35.151 --> 35:38.696
JAMES: So this is our
fight location for today.

35:51.459 --> 35:52.460
JAMES: It's ok.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.165
JAMES: What do you
think, I can just fight.

36:17.902 --> 36:21.364
You can call it off man. I mean
you don't. It's gambling man.

36:21.364 --> 36:22.949
You don't want
to lose this fight.

36:24.033 --> 36:25.660
Trust me I'm ready to fight.

36:28.538 --> 36:29.538
I'm ready.

36:52.645 --> 36:56.232
I think James is
going to win. I think so.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.128
Oh, oh, oh, oh. No.

37:29.515 --> 37:32.852
Counter counter counter counter.

39:05.903 --> 39:07.655

tag team anymore.

39:08.206 --> 39:09.507
Yea I think it's too dangerous.

39:09.574 --> 39:13.507
ABEL: but.. Technically
we won all of our matches.

39:13.536 --> 39:14.537
Yeah, we won everything.

39:14.829 --> 39:19.333
So, you know, we're not don't

39:19.333 --> 39:22.837
It wasn't just like I came in

39:22.837 --> 39:26.716
he won like no like you guys
already worked it from the start.

39:27.508 --> 39:30.511
It's the first time I've
seen Eric like all down.

39:30.511 --> 39:32.221
ABEL: Eric is not ok.

39:32.622 --> 39:33.631
Come on, man.

39:33.639 --> 39:34.832

Don't touch. Noo!

39:40.938 --> 39:42.031

39:43.149 --> 39:44.942
We need a massage.

39:46.235 --> 39:48.529
Yeah, do we have enough
money? Some doctor!

40:16.223 --> 40:17.516
I'm really scared.

40:17.933 --> 40:21.020
I think you should have pulled
out earlier, you know, yeah.

40:21.145 --> 40:23.898
you should have
pulled out faster.

40:24.315 --> 40:25.358
I'm worried about

40:26.192 --> 40:27.193
us.

40:28.319 --> 40:30.446
We made a plan, we stuck to it.

40:30.446 --> 40:32.531
We won we made money.

40:32.948 --> 40:35.242

things happening.

41:06.148 --> 41:07.733
I mean if you guys
aren't too busy.

41:08.234 --> 41:11.612
Maybe you'd like to come
over my way make a little money.

41:11.946 --> 41:17.535
Abel, she's good. Unick.
Unick comes to mind.

41:17.743 --> 41:18.744
I think.

41:19.829 --> 41:21.414
I need at least one week.

41:21.622 --> 41:25.209
But if you can guarantee the
fight in 7 days we'll be we'll

41:25.209 --> 41:26.235

43:32.711 --> 43:34.129

43:34.129 --> 43:35.314
You gotta look at their eyes.

43:35.314 --> 43:37.015
You gotta see the
fight, nah fuck all that

43:37.015 --> 43:38.233

I did fuckin credit card schemes.

43:46.934 --> 43:49.520
I sold drugs, I mean all
that shit, but at the end of

43:49.520 --> 43:52.439
the day you have to deal with
people. In this game, you don't

43:52.439 --> 43:55.234
deal with people you deal
with other bookies. You deal with

43:55.234 --> 43:57.920
other people, but they're not
customers you know what I mean they're

43:57.920 --> 44:00.647
in the game with you and people
don’t mind losing because they like

44:00.647 --> 44:03.742
betting on their players
and if they lose they eat it.

44:03.742 --> 44:07.121

I'm all right.

48:18.914 --> 48:20.040
It's an honor to meet you.

48:20.541 --> 48:21.625
It's an honor to meet you.

48:24.545 --> 48:25.637
I got to admit.

48:25.637 --> 48:30.834
I didn't think much of you the
first time but your boy Pedro.

48:30.926 --> 48:32.136
I think he's got something.

48:33.345 --> 48:35.439
I think we can make
something interesting happened.

48:35.530 --> 48:36.614
What do you say?

48:36.849 --> 48:37.908
Yeah, definitely.

48:38.016 --> 48:39.434
I'm all in for it.

48:40.144 --> 48:41.219
Okay very good.

48:41.436 --> 48:44.648
I think we need something next
week and I could put up a good fight.

48:45.315 --> 48:48.986
I have this guy Hitman, and I
think they make a really good show.

48:49.695 --> 48:50.712
Okay.

48:50.946 --> 48:53.323
Okay, just curious.

48:53.323 --> 48:57.119
But you know, is there
any way that I can get any

48:58.120 --> 49:02.416
previous footage of Hitman's
fights like previous fights.

49:02.416 --> 49:03.433
Is that possible?

49:05.043 --> 49:06.311
I can make that happen for you.

49:07.629 --> 49:09.715
But I need Pedro
ready in 5 days.

49:10.841 --> 49:11.849
Okay. Can you do that?

49:11.925 --> 49:14.178
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

49:15.137 --> 49:16.138
PEDRO: Be humble

49:26.648 --> 49:27.649
Are you Joshua?

49:27.649 --> 49:28.650
Yes I am Joshua.

49:28.650 --> 49:29.651
Your name is?

49:30.027 --> 49:31.445
James? Nice to meet you James.

49:33.614 --> 49:34.740
I think it's better.

49:34.740 --> 49:35.949
I introduce myself.

49:36.533 --> 49:39.870
So my name is Josh and
I'm sent here by Mr Bix.

49:41.121 --> 49:44.249
Yes, and my purpose
here is to find Pedro.

49:44.249 --> 49:45.417
I believe it's you.

49:45.834 --> 49:48.361
Nice to meet you And the
gentleman over here, what's your name?

49:48.545 --> 49:50.839
Soowoo Soowoo?
Nice to meet you too

49:51.340 --> 49:56.929
Now, what we're going to do
is go to a studio, which I rented

49:56.929 --> 49:59.139
outside and for about one hour.

49:59.139 --> 50:01.767
I think we should be able to
shoot a very nice promotional.

50:01.876 --> 50:03.085
video for you.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.451
Mr.Pedro Yeah, I need you
all to be excited about this.

50:07.113 --> 50:08.323
Yeah. Are you guys excited?

50:08.649 --> 50:09.741
Let's go.

50:09.741 --> 50:10.742
Okay, let's do it.

50:16.031 --> 50:19.826
I'm going to need you to make
me, you know different poses.

50:20.035 --> 50:21.119
Maybe punch.

50:21.127 --> 50:22.629
I may need a punch.

50:32.214 --> 50:33.306
What's Happening here?

50:52.109 --> 50:54.438
After this first fight,
after my first victory

50:54.462 --> 50:56.738
I feel like I just wanna
keep on doing this.

50:57.823 --> 51:01.326
I want to fight again as soon
as possible get back to training.

51:01.535 --> 51:02.661
I just want to keep going.

51:20.762 --> 51:23.432
To really be about that
life is a different story

51:31.231 --> 51:34.609
Yeah, let's just practice some
hand traps and some Judo moves.

51:35.027 --> 51:37.612
A lot of people who
fight bigger people

51:37.612 --> 51:39.323
They usually try to
get them on the back.

51:39.740 --> 51:42.117
So I think if you get him
on his back then I think

51:42.117 --> 51:43.327
we have a good chance.

51:44.328 --> 51:45.328
All right.

51:47.122 --> 51:48.139
Yeah.

51:52.544 --> 51:56.631
The force that you're generating.
Your kinda going with that force.

51:56.840 --> 51:58.467
So your just kinda going boom.

51:58.884 --> 51:59.985
It's kinda like a bear hug.

52:00.135 --> 52:03.930
Put you leg right here and boom.

52:09.227 --> 52:14.816
You can punch, but bring
it down after you punch.

52:14.816 --> 52:16.610
We never know exactly
how it's gonna go.

52:16.610 --> 52:20.030
So these are kind of emergency
moves that were just gonna

52:20.030 --> 52:21.114
prepare.

52:28.038 --> 52:34.211
This time let's try going for
the punch and then grapple.

52:34.211 --> 52:38.215
it feels like I'm getting
more power more energy.

52:39.424 --> 52:41.843
And even this like
everything right now.

52:41.843 --> 52:43.345
It doesn't look real to me.

52:43.720 --> 52:45.013
Like are we doing?

52:45.013 --> 52:46.247
Okay? I know I don't think so.

52:46.339 --> 52:48.141
This is like a joke.

52:48.141 --> 52:49.434
It's not like serious training.

52:49.434 --> 52:53.146
It's not like formal training
that we have to go through.

52:53.313 --> 52:58.318
The undefeated champion
of the dark web, Soowoo.

52:58.777 --> 52:59.778
You feel good? Yea.

53:01.405 --> 53:04.116
I just need you to really be
careful you know because

53:04.616 --> 53:07.035
I don't think you've ever
fought a guy this big before.

53:07.119 --> 53:11.248
Yeah, and I don't know if you
can if you can adjust to that

53:11.248 --> 53:12.324
kind of mass.

53:12.349 --> 53:14.626
Yeah, as long as my
mind is in the right place.

53:14.626 --> 53:15.627
I should be all right.

53:15.710 --> 53:16.744
Yeah.

53:18.839 --> 53:22.801
I just think you need to
be a little more, you know

53:24.094 --> 53:25.145
careful.

53:25.211 --> 53:27.714
Yeah next time just I'll
I'll train harder and better.

53:27.722 --> 53:28.849
Let's see what happens.

53:29.224 --> 53:30.508
I'm just gonna win it, you know.

53:31.643 --> 53:34.020
That's what McGregor
said, you know, fuck it.

53:35.522 --> 53:38.942
You know how like a some
fighters do flips after they win?

53:38.942 --> 53:40.235
Yeah, I'm gonna do a flip.

53:40.735 --> 53:41.827
Okay.

53:43.321 --> 53:44.322
Whoa.

53:49.244 --> 53:50.245
SOOWOO: Awesome

56:28.236 --> 56:30.864
Hey I just got back from
fighting the Hitman but

56:30.864 --> 56:34.868
so far it was the toughest
fight I've had in my life and

56:35.910 --> 56:38.705
I won I came out victorious.

56:40.373 --> 56:43.251
And yea I did
sustain some injuries.

56:45.045 --> 56:46.329
That's part of the fight game.

56:46.329 --> 56:47.747
That's what it's about.

56:48.214 --> 56:50.216
Like, we know what
we signed up for.

56:50.216 --> 56:57.349
So we did everything we could
yeah, we came out on top even

56:57.349 --> 57:02.437
though it was a really tough
fight and I did sustain some

57:02.437 --> 57:04.731
injuries, but it's
nothing too bad.

57:06.316 --> 57:10.612
It's kind of bad actually,
like my wrist can get better.

57:10.612 --> 57:13.239
But like there's a chance.

57:13.239 --> 57:16.910
It's not even going to heal so
well and same for my shoulder.

57:17.327 --> 57:19.287
It's torn pretty badly.

57:19.746 --> 57:22.582
And he said I actually
shouldn't fight anymore.

57:25.377 --> 57:28.963
Like my body is completely
going against me right now.

57:30.548 --> 57:32.133
That's just the reality.

57:37.639 --> 57:38.648
All right.

57:41.434 --> 57:47.732
Just hope nobody no one else
gets injured and I think everything

57:47.732 --> 57:48.733
will be okay.

58:02.414 --> 58:03.431
Ok take care of yourself.

58:03.431 --> 58:04.682
Yea Have a safe flight, and yea

58:04.833 --> 58:06.292
Okay, and I'll be healthy.

58:06.584 --> 58:07.585
Try not to get injured.

58:08.545 --> 58:09.795
Don't go too hard on yourself.

58:10.213 --> 58:11.423
I need to hurry up.

58:11.631 --> 58:13.925
Yeah, I need to make sure
my luggage is not overweight.

58:20.098 --> 58:22.809
Ok ok Take care of the guys and

58:23.977 --> 58:24.978
Abel's not coming? or

58:25.478 --> 58:26.938
I don't think so.

58:27.147 --> 58:29.149
I mean she's not
picking up her phone.

58:29.232 --> 58:30.324
Yeah.

59:13.693 --> 59:14.694
Alright bro.

59:14.861 --> 59:15.862
I'm a head out now.

59:15.862 --> 59:16.863
For sure.

59:17.572 --> 59:18.615
I'll hit you up Yea.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.316
Yea.

59:30.418 --> 59:31.836
ERIC: Like 3 p.m.

59:33.505 --> 59:34.506
Yea I know.

59:36.132 --> 59:37.133
Nothing.

59:37.133 --> 59:38.835
Just couldn't sleep.

59:39.010 --> 59:40.637
There's this red room

59:41.763 --> 59:43.932
and I found something shady

59:44.933 --> 59:47.644
Just getting like bunch
of invitations and stuff.

59:48.436 --> 59:51.397
And I found something
I don't know interesting.

59:53.191 --> 59:55.985
You know, you remember
back in like a couple of years ago.

59:56.069 --> 59:58.404
You fought this big
guy called Jaehyung.

59:59.239 --> 1:00:03.618
Ok yea Umm..I think I found him.

1:00:03.993 --> 1:00:04.994
Really.

1:00:06.329 --> 1:00:08.131
Yes, I think he's the
champion or something.

1:00:08.139 --> 1:00:10.975
Like, he's got the title.

1:00:13.711 --> 1:00:18.341
Well for me, I guess I would like
to become legit and bare-knuckle

1:00:18.341 --> 1:00:19.717
fighting is the ultimate.

1:00:20.343 --> 1:00:22.136
It's the highest risk. Legit

1:00:22.136 --> 1:00:25.849
MMA competitions it's
difficult to get into those

1:00:25.849 --> 1:00:28.434
cards. The money
is also not as good.

1:00:28.518 --> 1:00:32.230
The reward is worth the
risk of bare knuckle fighting.

1:00:32.522 --> 1:00:36.426
I'm trying to win and get the
submission with doing the least amount

1:00:36.426 --> 1:00:37.443
of damage possible.

1:00:37.443 --> 1:00:41.239
So playing the rubber guard,
you know, lock down electric

1:00:41.239 --> 1:00:44.325
chair any of that kind of
stuff omopalate gogopalate

1:00:44.325 --> 1:00:47.245
triangle get them an arm
bar submit them, it's exciting.

1:00:47.245 --> 1:00:52.125
It's a challenge. Make sure you
know what I'm bringing because

1:00:52.709 --> 1:00:55.712
I'll catch you when you don’t
expect it, you think that you

1:00:55.712 --> 1:00:57.213
can just smash me.

1:00:57.722 --> 1:01:00.333
You can try you might get a few
shots, but you better be careful.

1:01:00.333 --> 1:01:02.835
My friends and my family,
it's number one for me.

1:02:31.224 --> 1:02:32.809
James, why the call?

1:02:33.309 --> 1:02:35.969
I'm wondering if we can
create some kind of package

1:02:35.993 --> 1:02:38.439
deal where we can fight
some of your fighters.

1:02:38.856 --> 1:02:41.067
Okay, who are your people?

1:02:41.609 --> 1:02:43.111
I'm sure you've seen our fights.

1:02:45.029 --> 1:02:46.113
Yea yea yea.

1:02:50.535 --> 1:02:52.120
Alright, I think we
can do something.

1:02:52.412 --> 1:02:56.833
Ok, so Alright, I
got my boy Nemesis.

1:02:57.208 --> 1:02:58.226
Okay familiar.

1:02:58.626 --> 1:03:01.838
Hmm you and Nemesis I
think will be pretty good.

1:03:02.547 --> 1:03:03.840
Let me be honest with you here.

1:03:03.923 --> 1:03:09.637
So I got a fighter Sammy, she's
the toughest girl I have all right.

1:03:11.347 --> 1:03:14.517
Nah, Abel's not quite up to par.

1:03:16.019 --> 1:03:17.069
So

1:03:18.146 --> 1:03:19.230
I don't know.

1:03:19.230 --> 1:03:21.315
I need to see at least
one more fight out of Abel.

1:03:22.233 --> 1:03:23.234
All right.

1:03:23.818 --> 1:03:27.447
Yeah, she's really got to show
me that she has what it takes

1:03:27.447 --> 1:03:28.531
to go up against Sammy.

1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:33.327
Abel, she's really gotta come
through, really gotta impress me.

1:03:33.327 --> 1:03:34.328
Before I put Sammy.

1:03:34.746 --> 1:03:36.080
I don't wanna waste Sammy's time.

1:03:36.122 --> 1:03:37.540
I don't waste my time.

1:03:37.623 --> 1:03:41.836
All right, make sure you
and your girl understand that.

1:03:42.336 --> 1:03:47.675
Throw in 13%, 1
week, for the first fight

1:03:47.675 --> 1:03:48.676
13 percent?

1:03:48.718 --> 1:03:49.718
And you got my deal.

1:03:51.637 --> 1:03:52.847
We'll work with that.

1:03:53.723 --> 1:03:59.729
This is what matters. The atmosphere
induces a sense of calmness.

1:04:04.817 --> 1:04:06.110
When I come here I can think.

1:04:09.030 --> 1:04:11.949
When I come here, I
have space. I have time.

1:04:16.746 --> 1:04:17.830
Everything sits still.

1:04:20.708 --> 1:04:24.712
I'm the youngest of three, three
brothers, two older successful

1:04:24.712 --> 1:04:27.131
brothers, you know, I was
always an under-shadow.

1:04:27.924 --> 1:04:32.345
I always had to work twice as
hard especially to get my father's

1:04:32.345 --> 1:04:37.642
attention, you know. I was
so driven into this into this

1:04:37.642 --> 1:04:39.018
rage that I forgot

1:04:39.644 --> 1:04:42.021
who even won the fight and
that wasn't important, it didn't

1:04:42.021 --> 1:04:43.030
even matter.

1:04:43.940 --> 1:04:48.945
What mattered was the feeling
that I had, the urge the drive

1:04:49.445 --> 1:04:50.530
just to win.

1:04:51.322 --> 1:04:52.532
I never felt that before.

1:04:53.616 --> 1:04:57.036
But I'm looking more into new
styles, styles that fit my type.

1:04:57.620 --> 1:05:00.832
My body, my speed, my strengths.

1:05:03.126 --> 1:05:08.631
Looking more into Krav Maga.
Even the defense set you up for

1:05:08.631 --> 1:05:09.632
the counter.

1:05:15.429 --> 1:05:17.932
Steady diet and
lots of meditation.

1:05:18.224 --> 1:05:24.230
I'm all in it for Self-satisfaction
and if you're smart competitor,

1:05:25.022 --> 1:05:26.440
you'll be studying me right now.

1:05:28.025 --> 1:05:30.518
ERIC: What's the risk like?
Yeah, what you going to do James.

1:05:30.544 --> 1:05:31.611
ERIC: Like I don't know.

1:05:31.636 --> 1:05:32.820
What is that?

1:05:35.741 --> 1:05:38.244
ERIC: You can see
like bleeding and stuff.

1:05:43.249 --> 1:05:47.420
Whoa man, I wouldn't
do that for a million bucks.

1:05:48.629 --> 1:05:50.463
Let's catch up to X.

1:05:53.092 --> 1:05:54.302
X: Nemesis owns this club.

1:05:55.678 --> 1:05:56.679
Don't let him see you.

1:05:57.513 --> 1:05:58.531
Don't talk to him.

1:05:58.639 --> 1:05:59.715
Don't interact with him.

1:06:00.433 --> 1:06:02.435
And if anything happens
you don't know me.

1:06:02.935 --> 1:06:04.145
Alright man.

1:06:29.212 --> 1:06:30.338
Okay, James.

1:06:30.421 --> 1:06:32.215
We got our camera back.

1:06:32.715 --> 1:06:34.133
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1:06:36.219 --> 1:06:39.180
I got this alright. ERIC:
Dude, you don't, dude.

1:06:40.431 --> 1:06:42.049
ERIC: You don't know
what's in there man.

1:06:42.308 --> 1:06:44.352
ERIC: You don't have to
fight like this I'm fighting

1:06:44.376 --> 1:06:46.420
this guy anyways, so let
me just get this over with.

1:06:46.462 --> 1:06:48.964
ERIC: Dude you’re going to
fight in the future, don't fight now

1:06:49.014 --> 1:06:51.749
ERIC: Why do you want to
JAMES: I want to get this over with. Okay.

1:06:51.816 --> 1:06:54.194
Right now is the time.

1:06:54.904 --> 1:06:56.614
Ahh..bad decision.

1:07:01.619 --> 1:07:02.628
So sketchy.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.042
I’m not

1:07:21.347 --> 1:07:22.414
Are you serious?

1:07:45.413 --> 1:07:46.414
James?

1:08:47.725 --> 1:08:50.728
Dude James your
done man. Let's go man.

1:08:52.063 --> 1:08:54.148
Your fine, almost
there. One more floor

1:08:54.899 --> 1:08:57.151
Oh sh.. yo. You’re bleeding.

1:09:04.116 --> 1:09:05.442
Let's just get out of here man.

1:09:09.121 --> 1:09:10.239
Mr Bix.

1:09:12.917 --> 1:09:13.918
So what happened buddy?

1:09:15.711 --> 1:09:18.839
I was just I don't know.

1:09:18.839 --> 1:09:24.140
I don't know. I'm still trying to remember
exactly what happened

1:09:24.220 --> 1:09:25.237
It was.

1:09:26.347 --> 1:09:30.768
Somehow I bumped
into Nemesis and

1:09:31.143 --> 1:09:33.145
we just ended up fighting
right then and there.

1:09:35.439 --> 1:09:38.109
You somehow bumped

1:09:38.109 --> 1:09:39.318
I'm a little hazy right now

1:09:39.527 --> 1:09:40.694
into Nemesis.

1:09:42.321 --> 1:09:46.909
And your recollection is hazy.

1:09:48.828 --> 1:09:50.246
Yeah come on James.

1:09:51.122 --> 1:09:52.331
You can do better than that.

1:09:53.833 --> 1:09:59.713
You motherfucker you
cock sucking motherfucker.

1:09:59.839 --> 1:10:03.509
Do you have any fucking idea?

1:10:04.427 --> 1:10:09.223
What you have done, do you
have any fucking idea how much

1:10:09.348 --> 1:10:10.349
you have lost me?

1:10:10.433 --> 1:10:15.438
How much you have cost me.
My reputation you motherfucker.

1:10:20.609 --> 1:10:21.618
Mr Bix.

1:10:22.111 --> 1:10:25.531
I'll make it up to you.
You are through you are never

1:10:25.823 --> 1:10:28.325
ever working with us ever again.

1:10:28.826 --> 1:10:29.835
Goodbye.

1:10:31.245 --> 1:10:32.246
Get yourself together.

1:10:37.835 --> 1:10:38.911
I mean I won the fight

1:10:38.911 --> 1:10:40.713
I feel I felt great
at the moment.

1:10:40.713 --> 1:10:41.730
I felt good.

1:10:41.730 --> 1:10:44.341
I felt like I did the right
thing and I don't know there's

1:10:44.341 --> 1:10:48.220
something about myself
that I don't even understand.

1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:52.349
Other than that.
Was a good fight.

1:10:52.808 --> 1:10:54.935
Good work.
Guys actually impressed me.

1:10:54.935 --> 1:10:57.730
I didn't think you guys were
gonna put on the show that you

1:10:57.730 --> 1:10:59.648
did but everybody seemed happy.

1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:02.142
What do you think you ready
for round two, you want to

1:11:02.142 --> 1:11:03.644
make you wanna make
some more money.

1:11:03.736 --> 1:11:07.531
You've ever heard
of a guy named the Mongolian?

1:11:42.525 --> 1:11:48.322
He actually went up against
the champ Jae-hyung and I'm not

1:11:48.322 --> 1:11:52.326
going to lie, he came pretty close
to doing some serious damage.

1:11:52.743 --> 1:11:55.913
So with that comes a lot of
betting with that comes a lot

1:11:55.913 --> 1:11:56.930
of money.

1:11:56.930 --> 1:12:03.128
What I'm thinking is you
and him. This next fight

1:12:03.128 --> 1:12:04.547
was one that
actually came to me.

1:12:05.214 --> 1:12:09.635
Okay the girl named Sammy
Sammy wants to take on Abel.

1:12:11.528 --> 1:12:13.570
I do this shit because I'm
good at this shit.

1:12:13.639 --> 1:12:14.757
That's why I do this shit.

1:12:15.224 --> 1:12:16.642
I was born a weak kid.

1:12:16.642 --> 1:12:18.352
I got in and out of the hospital.

1:12:18.519 --> 1:12:20.563
I had to fight
just to stay alive.

1:12:20.563 --> 1:12:21.564
From like day one.

1:12:23.649 --> 1:12:26.235
My body just couldn't take
it and then I forced my body

1:12:26.235 --> 1:12:30.823
to take it. Now turns out my
dad was a motherfucker. And like

1:12:30.823 --> 1:12:35.119
to beat the shit out of us. And I
learned real quick like you can

1:12:35.119 --> 1:12:38.539
bow you can take it you can
bow but no matter how low you

1:12:38.539 --> 1:12:44.837
bow. They only stop hitting
you when you get back.

1:12:45.546 --> 1:12:48.841
is Sammy]

1:12:48.841 --> 1:12:53.012
I'm a fighter from this
part of town.

1:12:53.929 --> 1:12:55.014
I'm here for fight.

1:12:55.139 --> 1:12:59.018
What do you want me to
do sit in a cubicle type a little

1:12:59.018 --> 1:13:01.937
on the fucking computer when
I get to travel the world kick

1:13:01.937 --> 1:13:03.939
motherfuckers ass
get paid go party.

1:13:05.441 --> 1:13:10.529
Like why, is a good life. Well
I've studied a bunch of disciplines,

1:13:10.529 --> 1:13:15.242
but Definitely Muay Thai Fighter
like it's I've trained in Thailand.

1:13:15.409 --> 1:13:16.619
The art of the eight limbs.

1:13:16.619 --> 1:13:22.124
So you got like piss your
elbows your knees your kicks.

1:13:22.249 --> 1:13:25.336
So the eight limbs in half an
hour, you can teach everyone

1:13:25.336 --> 1:13:31.008
the moves and then it's
just repeat repeat repeat.

1:13:31.008 --> 1:13:34.553
It's simple, but it's clean.
Come here and take my punch.

1:13:35.846 --> 1:13:37.348
Oh you want to do a swing

1:13:37.348 --> 1:13:38.349
All right, that's cool.

1:13:38.432 --> 1:13:41.727
I'm gonna give you a
baseball bat of a leg to the head.

1:13:41.727 --> 1:13:46.231
See how well that works.
It's effective. Like this isn't

1:13:46.231 --> 1:13:47.316
martial arts.

1:13:47.441 --> 1:13:48.609
This is combat.

1:13:50.319 --> 1:13:51.695
This is street fighting.

1:13:52.905 --> 1:13:53.906
Nice pop.

1:13:58.160 --> 1:13:59.662
Ohh..that girl can hit.

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:01.872
Like yea, I can hit.

1:14:02.873 --> 1:14:04.500
Now let's get this on.

1:14:05.793 --> 1:14:07.252
I run around the world.

1:14:08.212 --> 1:14:09.713
Flying country to country

1:14:26.313 --> 1:14:29.525
The reason why I'm a little
bit hesitant on this because

1:14:29.525 --> 1:14:31.919
you know, even though I don't
care about drama and whatnot.

1:14:31.919 --> 1:14:34.713
I do care about butting heads
with other managers that are

1:14:35.447 --> 1:14:36.523
running around.

1:14:36.523 --> 1:14:38.525
We're kind of working
in the same circles.

1:14:38.534 --> 1:14:40.619
You know what I mean.
For this one.

1:14:40.619 --> 1:14:45.249
I'm gonna have to
write in twenty percent.

1:14:45.416 --> 1:14:48.210
If you can do me a favor if
you can do me one more favor,

1:14:48.210 --> 1:14:53.716
then I'll give you your 20
which is I have a well I have

1:14:53.716 --> 1:14:54.733
another fighter.

1:14:54.733 --> 1:14:59.638
His name is Eric and he's
been on a losing streak and I've

1:14:59.638 --> 1:15:01.849
been having a hard
time getting a fight.

1:15:02.349 --> 1:15:04.143
I think I do have
some guys that could.

1:15:06.311 --> 1:15:08.814
I do think yeah, I think I
got a group that'll that'll work.

1:15:10.816 --> 1:15:16.238
Decent crew decent guys.
Pretty much all about business.

1:15:16.238 --> 1:15:18.415
All about money just
so everything's on the table.

1:15:18.507 --> 1:15:20.300
They're gyopos like you.

1:15:21.326 --> 1:15:22.327
They're here.

1:15:22.745 --> 1:15:26.832
One of those guys actually
he's got kind of Eric's build.

1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:28.533
Now that I'm really
thinking about it.

1:15:28.917 --> 1:15:31.044
They do have a similar style.

1:15:31.044 --> 1:15:34.590
So then at least the
fight will be entertaining.

1:17:15.023 --> 1:17:16.483
We're all in good condition so

1:17:17.651 --> 1:17:19.377
I don't think there's
gonna be any problem.

1:17:19.411 --> 1:17:20.528
You're smart guy.

1:17:20.529 --> 1:17:24.825
Maybe you won't make the
mistake that the other ones make.

1:17:26.034 --> 1:17:28.829
What do you mean?
The fight is the easy part.

1:17:30.747 --> 1:17:33.333
It's knowing when to cash out
and walk away is the hard part.

1:17:34.334 --> 1:17:36.411
But I don't think you're
going to make that mistake.

1:17:41.633 --> 1:17:43.367
JAMES: Abel.
Are you okay?

1:17:46.305 --> 1:17:47.305
You ready?

1:17:49.141 --> 1:17:50.634
Tell me what
you're thinking here.

1:17:51.310 --> 1:17:52.519
This is your first fight.

1:17:53.437 --> 1:17:54.437
Yes.

1:17:55.439 --> 1:17:56.531
What are you thinking?

1:17:57.566 --> 1:17:58.567
I don't know.

1:18:00.110 --> 1:18:07.242
Remember remember this
this look this feeling Okay, this

1:18:07.242 --> 1:18:08.619
is what you need right now.

1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:16.919
Right you got this.

1:20:15.912 --> 1:20:16.930
Wait, just wait.

1:20:42.397 --> 1:20:43.565
Fuck.

1:20:50.113 --> 1:20:51.222
Wait, wait, wait.

1:20:57.037 --> 1:20:58.038
Don't touch.

1:20:58.288 --> 1:21:00.665
We're going to wait until
James comes so wait.

1:21:07.255 --> 1:21:09.091
Yes he's my mom so just wait.

1:21:09.591 --> 1:21:10.592
James is, whatever

1:21:11.718 --> 1:21:12.719
He's running late.

1:21:12.969 --> 1:21:15.597
Yes my mom, yes my mom.

1:21:17.516 --> 1:21:18.841
You ready?

1:21:18.934 --> 1:21:20.018
What?

1:21:20.018 --> 1:21:21.311
Man!

1:21:21.311 --> 1:21:23.522
He's a man!

You ready?

1:21:43.792 --> 1:21:45.335
SOOWOO: Should we call

1:22:12.529 --> 1:22:13.588
Dead?

1:23:02.245 --> 1:23:03.321

1:23:08.210 --> 1:23:09.210
You okay?

1:23:13.131 --> 1:23:14.148
Yo.

1:23:14.883 --> 1:23:15.967
What happened.

1:23:17.135 --> 1:23:18.236
Are you ok?

1:23:31.024 --> 1:23:32.024

1:23:33.568 --> 1:23:34.945
Hey yo Eric, c'mon.

1:23:37.739 --> 1:23:39.074
What happened, talk to me.

1:23:44.746 --> 1:23:45.830
Eric.

1:23:48.625 --> 1:23:49.717
Yo.

1:24:06.893 --> 1:24:07.894
Hey!!!

1:24:33.837 --> 1:24:34.921
Just jump?

1:31:32.004 --> 1:31:33.131
What's happening man.

1:31:33.339 --> 1:31:34.340
What's up man.

1:31:34.340 --> 1:31:35.341
What's up.

1:31:43.516 --> 1:31:45.601
I think you need to work
on more hooks maybe.

1:31:45.727 --> 1:31:47.437
Right hook is very weak buddy.

1:31:47.812 --> 1:31:52.316
I think mine is weaker but I'm
kinda developing this new technique

1:31:52.316 --> 1:31:55.737
where you know, I can
like lunge and like punch.

1:31:56.112 --> 1:32:00.241
So one, like this you know but
you know, we'll see how it works.

1:32:00.658 --> 1:32:05.371
Get dressed and let's train! I say
your right hook needs to be worked on!

1:32:05.538 --> 1:32:06.622
Okay, let's go.

1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:11.627
haaaa!!! hah!!!!

1:32:19.552 --> 1:32:20.762
Hey keep your distance Eric.

1:32:27.643 --> 1:32:29.395
Lighter on your feet,
lighter on the feet.

1:32:29.937 --> 1:32:31.038
Lighter on your feet Eric.

1:32:33.441 --> 1:32:35.318
Check it, check it
yea there you go.

1:32:36.194 --> 1:32:37.278
Good.

1:32:37.987 --> 1:32:38.988
Distance.

1:32:44.827 --> 1:32:47.038
Maneuver Get out
of that position.

1:32:53.795 --> 1:32:55.713
You're doin good, pace yourself.

1:33:01.886 --> 1:33:03.095
This is a sparring match man.

1:33:03.346 --> 1:33:04.347
What are you doing.

1:33:08.059 --> 1:33:09.260
Eric, it's a sparring match.

1:33:11.521 --> 1:33:14.899
Hey! At least help
the guy up man.

1:33:17.860 --> 1:33:18.869
Are you ok?

1:33:20.154 --> 1:33:22.114
It's not a fucking easy
sparring, what the fuck.

1:34:25.219 --> 1:34:26.253
Pedro?

1:34:26.253 --> 1:34:28.547
Yes, we goto Africa.

1:34:29.515 --> 1:34:30.741
Yeah. Okay.

1:34:32.226 --> 1:34:33.436
Eric is okay?

1:34:34.437 --> 1:34:35.821
Yeah. I don't know.

1:34:59.795 --> 1:35:02.881
Like, almost two
weeks. Two weeks?

1:35:03.049 --> 1:35:04.124
Yeah.

1:35:26.864 --> 1:35:29.617
Maybe I'm over thinking things.
But I don't know what to do.

1:35:32.828 --> 1:35:33.921
You guys fight?

1:35:33.946 --> 1:35:35.322
No, we didn't fight.

1:35:35.748 --> 1:35:36.840
We didn't fight.

1:35:37.041 --> 1:35:40.836
It's just all of a sudden it's
really weird it's really strange.

1:35:42.213 --> 1:35:43.230
I will try.

1:35:43.714 --> 1:35:44.924
I will try everyday.

1:36:32.346 --> 1:36:33.514
Fucking piece of shit.

1:36:33.514 --> 1:36:35.433
I know you fucking
back-stabbed us.

1:36:35.433 --> 1:36:37.435
All right, I'm gonna
fucking kill you.

1:36:37.810 --> 1:36:39.145
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1:36:39.145 --> 1:36:41.212
Do you understand?
I'm gonna fucking

1:37:05.629 --> 1:37:07.113
Hey man. How's it going.

1:37:07.298 --> 1:37:09.175
No no let's just make
it quick this time.

1:37:09.508 --> 1:37:10.576
Alright.

1:37:20.519 --> 1:37:22.396
That's all the information
that I have on him.

1:37:31.072 --> 1:37:34.658
Alright so by the way I
heard you're in trouble.

1:37:35.451 --> 1:37:37.912
If you need some money, you
know I can organize any fight.

1:37:40.539 --> 1:37:42.249
I'm not in a position
to fight right now.

1:37:42.917 --> 1:37:44.919
Just use your friends money.

1:37:46.420 --> 1:37:47.529
What are you talking about?

1:37:48.756 --> 1:37:51.008
Your friend that was with
you last time. From Chicago.

1:37:51.926 --> 1:37:53.310
He's fighting pretty big fight.

1:37:53.344 --> 1:37:54.520
You can use that money.

1:37:55.638 --> 1:37:57.739
He's fighting a fight?
X: Did you know?

1:37:57.848 --> 1:38:01.644
No I lost touch with him
for about a week and a half.

1:38:02.978 --> 1:38:04.004
Oh.

1:38:05.439 --> 1:38:06.523
Okay.

1:38:07.608 --> 1:38:10.535
Can you tell me more about this
fight like where it's taking place in?

1:38:11.529 --> 1:38:12.613

1:38:19.995 --> 1:38:20.996
All right all right.

1:38:21.622 --> 1:38:23.624
I will lead you in
the right direction.

1:43:01.443 --> 1:43:02.527
You hear me?

1:43:02.945 --> 1:43:06.240
Hey, I went to two of
the locations and I didn't

1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:07.332
see anything.

1:43:09.910 --> 1:43:10.944
You sure.

1:43:42.484 --> 1:43:43.510
JAMES: Eric.

1:45:05.359 --> 1:45:06.527
JAMES: Eric c'mon.

1:45:08.237 --> 1:45:10.531
JAMES: Remember when
we use to ride in the car.

1:45:10.531 --> 1:45:13.408
JAMES: You were the only one
that couldn't fit in, you use to jog.

1:45:14.910 --> 1:45:16.011
JAMES:You were the only one.

1:45:16.328 --> 1:45:18.330
JAMES: You use
to take care of us.

1:45:21.542 --> 1:45:23.085
This isn't fighting alright.

1:45:23.335 --> 1:45:25.536
This isn't street fighting
This isn't street fighting.

1:45:25.921 --> 1:45:26.922
This isn't you!

1:45:27.089 --> 1:45:28.090
This isn't us. C'mon.

1:45:28.257 --> 1:45:30.050
Just drop the knife,
give me the knife.

1:45:34.304 --> 1:45:35.305
JAMES: Give me the knife.

1:45:35.556 --> 1:45:36.648
Give me the knife.

1:45:36.807 --> 1:45:37.808
Give me the knife.

1:45:38.433 --> 1:45:41.299
Don't you remember that,
don't you remember all the good

1:45:41.323 --> 1:45:44.189
times we had when practicing.
That's what it's all about.

1:45:46.233 --> 1:45:47.234
It's all about us.

1:45:47.234 --> 1:45:49.069
Us not you alright.

1:45:49.945 --> 1:45:51.071
C'mon Eric.

1:45:51.572 --> 1:45:52.573
I need you.

1:45:54.533 --> 1:45:57.619
I need you to be with me, I need
you to stay with me. Just drop the knife.

1:45:59.037 --> 1:46:00.038
RIVAL: Hey hey hey

1:46:01.915 --> 1:46:03.500
Just drop the knife please.

1:46:04.501 --> 1:46:05.577
Abel went home.

1:46:05.602 --> 1:46:06.603
Pedro went home.

1:46:06.628 --> 1:46:07.879
Let's go home.

1:46:10.382 --> 1:46:11.717
Eric, Eric sit down.

1:46:13.552 --> 1:46:14.845
JAMES: Eric sit down please.

1:46:14.845 --> 1:46:15.846
JAMES: Just 5 minutes.

1:46:18.348 --> 1:46:22.108
Eric just drop it, you don't need to
do this! Eric you don't need to do this!

1:46:27.649 --> 1:46:28.733
Come on.

1:47:21.353 --> 1:47:24.247
More than prove something to the
world, share something with the world.

1:47:24.247 --> 1:47:28.001
I feel like I have something
in me. That I have to manifest.

1:47:28.627 --> 1:47:33.006
And once that's manifest then I
feel like that's gonna benefit the world.

1:47:33.507 --> 1:47:34.841
Through my knowledge.

1:47:34.841 --> 1:47:37.928
I can share my learnings from
my journeys around the world.

1:47:37.928 --> 1:47:41.848
So I feel like this
is my duty in my life.

1:47:41.848 --> 1:47:45.435
Like I need to I need to
follow this desire that I have.

1:47:46.019 --> 1:47:48.230
We need a nickname
though James something.

1:47:49.940 --> 1:47:52.567
I'm a champ I'm a champ
I'm a champ!

1:47:52.567 --> 1:47:56.196
What we have in common is like

1:47:56.238 --> 1:48:00.617
we are willing to take
anything to reach our goal.

1:48:00.617 --> 1:48:02.244
I think that's the
fundamental thing.

1:48:02.244 --> 1:48:06.748
And that's what we have.
Everyone in our team have in common.

1:48:08.709 --> 1:48:10.544
Come on, don't run away.

1:48:10.877 --> 1:48:13.088
Oh it hit my balls

1:48:14.131 --> 1:48:15.132
The ball hit my balls.

1:48:27.811 --> 1:48:28.887
The Colosseum?

1:48:29.646 --> 1:48:30.647
What is the Colosseum?

1:48:32.149 --> 1:48:35.235
The Colosseum is where the
toughest fighters in the world

1:48:35.235 --> 1:48:39.531
unite to become
the best in the world.

1:48:40.449 --> 1:48:43.326
And if you don't know
what you're doing.

1:48:44.745 --> 1:48:48.915
Then it's going to eat you
up and swallow you it's gonna

1:48:49.624 --> 1:48:52.419
chew you up and spit you out.

1:48:53.128 --> 1:48:56.131
So you better know
what you're doing, right?

1:49:38.632 --> 1:49:40.258
So my best fighter Jae-Hyung.

1:49:42.010 --> 1:49:43.011
He accepted.
