00:41.305 --> 00:44.341
This bus has seen better days.

00:44.516 --> 00:46.758
Well, at least it's safer
than the old bus.

00:52.983 --> 00:55.557
Time to move.
The hole's getting bigger.

01:00.824 --> 01:03.315
Seymour, the children are playing
in the hole again.

01:03.494 --> 01:04.869
Shouldn't you get that fixed?

01:05.790 --> 01:07.451
Edna, you know they just
cut the school's budget.

01:07.623 --> 01:09.829
If I had the money,
I'd fix the exhaust leak.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.367
I think it's causing
some of our low test scores.

01:19.176 --> 01:21.548
The battlefield is just
a half-mile ahead.

01:21.762 --> 01:24.218
Begin braking procedure!

01:30.229 --> 01:35.223
This Civil War cannon has been fully
restored and is in ready-to-fire condition.

01:35.401 --> 01:37.773
But it's a good thing
we're not firing it...

01:37.987 --> 01:42.732
...because it happens to be aimed at the
main support leg of that lookout tower.

01:43.158 --> 01:46.990
People don't realize that these cannons
are very sensitive...

01:47.162 --> 01:50.781
...and the slightest jolt could
set them off.

01:52.876 --> 01:54.536
Of course, for safety reasons...

01:54.753 --> 01:56.912
...we don't keep the cannon loaded.

01:57.890 --> 01:59.820
It's just common sense.

02:01.260 --> 02:06.500
Otto, why don't you get some more gas.
Here's the credit card.

02:07.516 --> 02:08.795
And a mint for afterwards.

02:09.180 --> 02:12.517
Five dollars a child?
Last year it was free!

02:12.688 --> 02:14.990
New ownership.

02:19.690 --> 02:22.687
But we don't have that kind of money.
In fact, no school could afford...

02:30.706 --> 02:33.576
Here's the admission,
plus something for you.

02:33.751 --> 02:35.992
See that they get
a little extra education.

02:36.211 --> 02:38.121
Yes, sir, Principal Valiant!

02:38.380 --> 02:41.583
He thinks he's so hot ever since
he swept the Princi Awards.

02:41.759 --> 02:43.134
Those things are rigged.

02:44.110 --> 02:49.681
On May 21, 1864, the men
of the 9th Bearded Infantry...

02:49.850 --> 02:52.388
...were sunning and fluffing
their beards in the sun.

02:52.603 --> 02:56.980
Suddenly, enemy troops
crested that hill over there.

02:57.149 --> 03:00.435
Fort Springfield,
we surrender unconditionally!

03:00.611 --> 03:02.687
We're sick!
We need leeches...

03:02.863 --> 03:05.734
...and hacksaws to saw off
our gangrenous limbs.

03:05.908 --> 03:09.775
But the Springfield brigade was
too brave to accept their surrender.

03:09.953 --> 03:13.821
Come on, boys. Those white flags
are no match for our muskets!

03:13.999 --> 03:15.624
Charge!

03:15.793 --> 03:18.747
And the Springfielders heroically
slaughtered their enemies...

03:18.921 --> 03:20.913
...as they prayed for mercy.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.510
It's hard to see what's going on.
I can only make out the fat soldiers.

03:28.681 --> 03:30.900
All right, children. Switch.

03:32.935 --> 03:35.852
Hey, they're trying to learn for free!

03:36.210 --> 03:38.808
- Get them!
- Use your phony guns as clubs!

03:39.240 --> 03:40.981
Run, children.

03:42.152 --> 03:44.987
Start the bus, Otto! Start the bus!

03:45.698 --> 03:48.901
Damn! I shouldn't have
eaten the mint first.

03:50.770 --> 03:52.700
Okay, hop on.

03:52.871 --> 03:54.994
Wait! Wait!

04:04.675 --> 04:06.798
Seymour, because of
your penny-pinching...

04:06.969 --> 04:10.219
...we're coming back from a field trip
with the fewest children yet.

04:10.389 --> 04:13.639
God bless the man who invented
permission slips.

04:15.811 --> 04:17.637
I think I got your lunch.

04:20.357 --> 04:21.851
I didn't think this was for me.

04:24.987 --> 04:26.814
Seymour, the teachers are fed up.

04:26.989 --> 04:29.650
You have to put money
back into the school.

04:29.241 --> 04:30.819
You've cut back on everything.

04:30.993 --> 04:33.828
Salaries, supplies, the food.

04:34.330 --> 04:36.821
I don't care what you say,
I can taste the newspaper.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.908
Shredded newspapers add much-needed
roughage and essential inks.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.494
Besides, you didn't notice
the old gym mats.

04:43.714 --> 04:46.466
There's very little meat
in these gym mats.

04:46.675 --> 04:48.798
Our demands are very reasonable.

04:48.969 --> 04:52.136
By ignoring them, you're selling out
these children's futures.

04:52.348 --> 04:55.799
Oh, come on, Edna! We both know
these children have no future!

04:59.355 --> 05:03.103
Prove me wrong, kids.
Prove me wrong.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.444
I've never seen them
fight like that.

05:07.613 --> 05:10.982
I'm worried that all this posturing
could lead to a teachers' strike.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.358
Strike, eh?

05:14.870 --> 05:16.697
My bones are so brittle.

05:16.872 --> 05:19.826
But I always drink plenty of "malk"?

05:21.669 --> 05:24.456
How do you expect us to teach
with these supplies?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.913
This pointer's so old,
it's worn down to a nub.

05:28.217 --> 05:29.628
It still points, doesn't it?

05:29.802 --> 05:31.841
Stop that! And look at this.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.179
The only books we have are ones
that were banned by other schools.

05:36.767 --> 05:40.266
Well, the kids have to learn about
Tek War sooner or later.

05:41.522 --> 05:43.514
Go away, Bart.
This is not a good time.

05:43.732 --> 05:45.226
I saw you two fighting.

05:45.401 --> 05:48.900
I'm worried there could be a strike
and the school would shut down.

05:49.710 --> 05:50.779
I'm sure you'd really hate that.

05:51.115 --> 05:54.281
- There's not going to be a strike, Bart.
- Yeah.

05:54.451 --> 05:57.156
Skinner said you wouldn't
go through with it.

05:57.329 --> 06:00.247
- Skinner said that?
- Well, I had to clean it up a little.

06:00.624 --> 06:04.289
But basically, Krabappel said you'd give
the teachers everything they want.

06:04.461 --> 06:05.742
- She did?
- Yeah.

06:05.921 --> 06:08.590
She said you'd fold faster
than Superman on laundry day.

06:08.966 --> 06:10.543
We'll see about that.

06:10.759 --> 06:14.591
Simpson, I always thought you were
sneaky and manipulative.

06:14.763 --> 06:18.298
Now I see you're
really a very sensitive little boy.

06:18.517 --> 06:20.225
Thank you, sir.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.723
You're being totally unfair,
and the teachers won't stand for it!

06:24.940 --> 06:27.977
Teachers! You don't have
the guts to strike!

06:28.152 --> 06:31.568
You don't have the guts
to take us all on!

06:35.784 --> 06:38.454
- That's it!
- Strike!

06:41.707 --> 06:44.198
Attention, this is
an emergency broadcast.

06:44.376 --> 06:49.204
All is well in the school.
My authority as principal is total...

06:49.381 --> 06:50.959
Hey, give me that!

06:51.133 --> 06:54.882
Attention, teachers. We're on strike!

06:57.181 --> 06:58.805
Oh, no. Strike?

06:59.160 --> 07:01.222
Miss Hoover, are you on...?

07:01.393 --> 07:03.469
Go home, children.

07:03.937 --> 07:06.960
Hello?

07:06.607 --> 07:10.580
Mrs. Pommelhorst?

07:10.986 --> 07:12.860
I'd like to get down now.

07:18.327 --> 07:22.621
Hey, now that Largo's gone,
we can play the forbidden music.

07:28.170 --> 07:30.440
I heard that!

07:39.932 --> 07:42.553
Bart? Lisa? What are you two
doing home so early?

07:42.726 --> 07:45.893
- Great news, Mom!
- Horrible news, Mom!

07:46.105 --> 07:48.856
The school's on strike! Maybe forever.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.480
Overload. Pleasure overload.

07:53.487 --> 07:56.108
Luckily I've prepared for this,
so I'm not too worried.

08:00.953 --> 08:03.823
Sit up straight. Eyes forward.
No talking.

08:03.998 --> 08:07.820
Is that gum? Is that gum?
Is that gum?

08:07.251 --> 08:09.540
Oh, yeah.

08:11.171 --> 08:14.836
Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know
I don't like you prying and jimmying.

08:15.217 --> 08:17.673
Mom! Dad! Great news!
The teachers are on...

08:17.845 --> 08:20.418
- We heard.
- And we already hired a tutor.

08:20.597 --> 08:23.135
Well, looks like we'll be
staying late today...

08:23.309 --> 08:25.800
...to make up for all this dilly-dallying.

08:37.698 --> 08:39.192
Awesome.

08:40.909 --> 08:43.660
You, at the crane!
Spin around real fast!

08:48.876 --> 08:52.624
Now, you! Dump 3 tons of sand
onto that Porta-Potty.

08:56.884 --> 09:00.716
Hey! Can't you tell my voice
from a 10-year-old kid's?

09:01.555 --> 09:02.930
Ay caramba!

09:18.781 --> 09:21.532
Hey, that little boy
is playing three games at once.

09:21.700 --> 09:22.696
- Checkmate.
- Checkmate.

09:22.868 --> 09:23.864
- Checkmate.
- Dang.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.997
Lousy teachers, trying
to palm off our kids on us.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.835
Dad, by striking, they're trying
to change management...

09:32.200 --> 09:34.209
...so they can be happier
and more productive.

09:34.380 --> 09:37.713
Lisa, if you don't like your job,
you don't strike.

09:37.883 --> 09:42.130
You just go in every day
and do it really half-assed.

09:42.304 --> 09:43.964
That's the American way.

09:44.181 --> 09:46.886
I've got textbooks.
But without state-approved syllabi...

09:47.590 --> 09:50.600
...and standardized testing,
my education can only go so far.

09:50.229 --> 09:52.684
Honey, maybe you should
relax a little.

09:52.898 --> 09:56.848
Relax? I can't relax!
Nor can I yield, relent or...

09:57.861 --> 09:59.901
Only two synonyms?

10:00.656 --> 10:04.404
Oh, my God!
I'm losing my perspicacity!

10:05.995 --> 10:08.664
Well, it's always in
the last place you look.

10:14.169 --> 10:17.503
If we were in school this week,
what do you think we'd be learning?

10:17.673 --> 10:19.840
Get away from me.

10:19.299 --> 10:21.173
Good news, people!

10:21.844 --> 10:25.378
I'm happy to announce another union
has joined us in a sympathy strike!

10:25.556 --> 10:27.881
The Piano Tuners Local 412!

10:33.272 --> 10:35.977
Now for Operation
Strike-Make-Go-Longer.

10:37.192 --> 10:41.240
You know, I heard Skinner say
the teachers will crack any minute.

10:45.534 --> 10:48.203
Skinner said we'll crack,
purple monkey dishwasher.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.781
Well, we'll show him!

10:49.955 --> 10:53.538
Especially for that "purple
monkey dishwasher" remark.

10:55.878 --> 10:58.203
Seymour, you are truly incompetent!

10:58.380 --> 11:01.465
- Well, I hardly think it's fair...
- Dummy up, you!

11:01.633 --> 11:04.588
Listen to those passing motorists
who support the teachers.

11:09.767 --> 11:11.309
Fifteen-minute recess, Milhouse.

11:11.477 --> 11:14.500
The recess assignment is
chapters three through seven.

11:14.271 --> 11:16.844
Yay! Recess!

11:18.670 --> 11:21.186
I found a hive of killer bees.
You want to go throw rocks at it?

11:21.403 --> 11:24.938
Sorry, Bart. I'm deeply immersed
in the Teapot Dome scandal.

11:25.741 --> 11:28.410
However, it might
be feasible in a fortnight.

11:29.370 --> 11:30.615
I can play in two weeks.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.625
I just can't believe Stark
would stoop to that...

11:38.796 --> 11:43.125
...and right in the middle
of Montana and Dakota's wedding.

11:45.719 --> 11:50.346
All this free time. I never thought I'd get
sick of Razor Fight II, The Slashening.

11:50.516 --> 11:54.300
I probably should stop. My doctor says
I have the wrists of an 80-year-old.

11:59.149 --> 12:02.649
What do you mean, the bank
is out of money? Insolvent?

12:02.820 --> 12:05.441
You only have enough cash
for the next three customers?

12:10.786 --> 12:15.329
Just a second here.
No, no. I don't have your money here.

12:15.499 --> 12:18.868
It's in Bill's house, and Fred's house.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.170
Hey, what the hell you doing with
my money in your house, Fred?

12:28.846 --> 12:31.171
Grade me! Look at me!

12:31.390 --> 12:33.133
Evaluate and rank me!

12:33.308 --> 12:35.716
I'm good, good, good
and, oh, so smart!

12:35.894 --> 12:37.721
Grade me!

12:45.988 --> 12:47.815
I'm worried about the kids, Homie.

12:48.157 --> 12:50.564
Lisa's becoming very obsessive.

12:50.743 --> 12:53.909
This morning, I caught her trying
to dissect her own raincoat.

12:54.913 --> 12:59.706
I know. And this perpetual-motion
machine she made today is a joke.

12:59.877 --> 13:02.581
It just keeps going faster and faster.

13:02.796 --> 13:04.706
And Bart isn't doing very well either.

13:04.882 --> 13:07.170
He needs boundaries and structure.

13:07.593 --> 13:11.673
There's something about flying a kite
at night that's so unwholesome.

13:11.847 --> 13:14.890
Hello, Mother dear.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.686
That's it! We have to get them
back to school.

13:17.853 --> 13:21.139
I'm with you, Marge.
Lisa, get in here.

13:22.358 --> 13:25.561
In this house, we obey
the laws of thermodynamics!

13:28.197 --> 13:32.146
All right. I'd like to call this meeting
of the PTA to or-diddly-order.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.859
Let's see if we can't put
an end to this strike fuss.

13:35.370 --> 13:38.121
- Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin.
- Boo.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.739
Oh, "boo" yourself!
Our demands are simple.

13:41.919 --> 13:46.581
A small cost-of-living increase and better
equipment and supplies for your children.

13:47.132 --> 13:48.959
- Yeah, all right!
- Give it to them!

13:49.677 --> 13:52.214
Yeah, in a dream world.
We have a very tight budget.

13:52.388 --> 13:55.175
To do what she's asking,
we'd have to raise taxes.

13:55.391 --> 13:57.763
- Raise taxes?
- They're too high as they are now.

13:57.935 --> 13:59.726
- I've had enough.
- Taxes are bad.

13:59.937 --> 14:01.348
It's your children's future.

14:01.563 --> 14:04.517
- Children's future.
- Yes, children are important.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.856
- It'll cost you.
- Oh, the taxes.

14:07.270 --> 14:09.399
They're gonna raise taxes.

14:09.613 --> 14:12.282
- Come on.
- All right, that's a good point.

14:12.449 --> 14:14.193
Oh, yeah, that sounds...

14:14.702 --> 14:17.406
- Oh, yeah, the taxes.
- That means money.

14:17.579 --> 14:19.655
The finger thing means the taxes.

14:19.873 --> 14:23.657
I guess this is a case where
we'll have to agree to disagree.

14:23.836 --> 14:25.793
- I don't agree to that.
- Neither do I.

14:27.339 --> 14:28.917
This is a dilly of a pickle.

14:29.174 --> 14:32.128
Oh, my God! The PTA has disbanded!

14:34.304 --> 14:37.471
No, no! The PTA has not disbanded.

14:40.602 --> 14:44.814
We do have an emergency plan,
in case of a prolonged strike, right here.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.518
Let's see.

14:46.859 --> 14:50.691
"Replace teachers
with superintelligent cyborgs.

14:50.863 --> 14:54.232
Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet,
use people from the neighborhood."

14:57.202 --> 15:00.453
Talking out of turn, that's a paddling.

15:00.622 --> 15:04.490
Looking out the window,
that's a paddling.

15:04.668 --> 15:08.333
Staring at my sandals,
that's a paddling.

15:08.797 --> 15:13.910
Paddling the school canoe,
you better believe that's a paddling.

15:17.556 --> 15:20.225
All right, so the compression
and expansion...

15:20.392 --> 15:23.844
...of the longitudinal waves
cause the erratic oscillation...

15:24.630 --> 15:27.348
You can see it there.
- Of the neighboring particles.

15:28.250 --> 15:29.768
Yes? What is it? What? What is it?

15:29.985 --> 15:32.310
- Can I play with it?
- No, you can't play with it.

15:32.488 --> 15:35.607
You won't enjoy it
on as many levels as I do.

15:36.575 --> 15:38.651
The colors, children.

15:39.286 --> 15:43.615
Okay, when I call your name,
you say "present" or "here."

15:43.791 --> 15:45.368
No, say "present."

15:45.918 --> 15:47.957
Anita Bath.

15:49.296 --> 15:52.131
All right. Settle down.
Anita Bath here?

15:53.550 --> 15:55.175
All right, fine. Fine.

15:55.344 --> 15:56.838
Maya Buttreeks.

16:01.183 --> 16:03.721
Hey, what are you laughing at? What?

16:03.894 --> 16:07.140
Oh, I get it. I get it.

16:07.690 --> 16:11.230
It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it?

16:11.443 --> 16:14.278
Well, children, I can't help that.

16:20.202 --> 16:24.366
Wow, Bart! I'm impressed the way
you knocked off all those substitutes.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.327
In my weaker moments,
I almost pity them.

16:27.501 --> 16:31.415
Then I just remind myself,
they're trying to teach.

16:31.630 --> 16:36.422
I don't know what you did to all those
substitutes, but it's going to stop now.

16:36.593 --> 16:37.969
Leopold?

16:38.137 --> 16:42.929
All right. You listen up, you little freaks!
The fun stops here.

16:43.100 --> 16:46.635
You're gonna shut your
stinking traps and behave, damn it!

16:46.812 --> 16:49.385
This is one substitute
you're not gonna screw with!

16:50.441 --> 16:52.517
Marge Simpson.

16:54.111 --> 16:56.436
Hello, class. Hi, Bart.

16:56.613 --> 16:58.939
Over here, sweetie.
It's me, Mom.

16:59.241 --> 17:02.361
Hi. Hey. Hello!

17:08.751 --> 17:12.839
Well, I'm sure some of you already
know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.715
Mom.

17:17.926 --> 17:20.880
Hey, Bart, what about the booby trap?

17:25.267 --> 17:26.761
- May I?
- Thank you.

17:26.977 --> 17:29.812
- Mama's boy!
- Teacher's pet! Teacher's pet!

17:31.106 --> 17:33.348
I meant the other booby trap.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.983
Kids have been doing
that one since my day.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.993
So how was everybody's
day at school?

17:45.204 --> 17:46.579
- Horrifying.
- Pointless.

17:46.789 --> 17:50.703
Exhausting. It took the children 40
minutes to locate Canada on the map.

17:50.876 --> 17:54.494
Marge, anyone can miss Canada,
all tucked away down there.

17:54.672 --> 17:58.455
My teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got
sick from inhaling his ointment fumes.

17:58.634 --> 18:02.133
He confiscated everything made of tin.
And then he sent us home early...

18:02.304 --> 18:05.175
...because he got his beard
caught in the pencil sharpener.

18:08.185 --> 18:10.261
Oh, okay.

18:11.355 --> 18:12.814
Here.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.897
Okay. Let's see.

18:17.152 --> 18:19.359
What if I did this?

18:21.240 --> 18:22.900
You're on your own.

18:24.994 --> 18:27.663
There's no way I'll get into
an Ivy League school now.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.534
At this rate, I probably won't
even get into Vassar.

18:30.708 --> 18:34.408
I've had just about enough
of your Vassar-bashing, young lady!

18:34.586 --> 18:37.671
Look, Mom. It feels really weird
having you on my turf.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.832
How would you feel
if I started mopping?

18:40.900 --> 18:42.464
I'd be thrilled.
You can start right now.

18:42.886 --> 18:46.600
And I'm gonna keep teaching your class,
like it or lump it.

18:46.181 --> 18:51.389
Well, then. I guess I'll just have
to get into the crawlspace again.

18:52.187 --> 18:54.310
I hate it when he gets in there.

19:02.990 --> 19:04.698
Over here.

19:06.760 --> 19:07.619
Mom, I need a dollar.

19:07.786 --> 19:10.906
Since you started teaching,
kids have been taking my lunch money.

19:11.810 --> 19:12.789
And I need that money for candy.

19:13.250 --> 19:17.462
Here you go, precious.
Now, go off with your friends.

19:17.922 --> 19:20.591
"Here you go, precious."

19:23.427 --> 19:25.384
Why isn't my mom stopping this?

19:25.554 --> 19:27.962
We've created a diversion.

19:29.141 --> 19:31.134
That's a very nice jig, Kearney.

19:31.352 --> 19:33.640
Now, isn't dancing much more
fun than bullying?

19:33.854 --> 19:35.313
Yeah.

19:37.358 --> 19:40.193
That's it.
I can't take this anymore, Milhouse.

19:40.402 --> 19:42.312
I've got to get the real teachers back.

19:42.488 --> 19:45.821
Bart, you'll never get Krabappel
and Skinner together again.

19:45.991 --> 19:49.158
They're like two
positively charged ions.

19:50.913 --> 19:52.193
Wait, that's it.

19:52.373 --> 19:56.453
With your book smarts and my ability
to exploit people with book smarts...

19:56.627 --> 19:59.414
...we can figure out a plan
to get them back together.

19:59.630 --> 20:03.810
A surprise party for me
in Principal Skinner's office?

20:03.258 --> 20:05.631
Well, I don't know, but all right.

20:05.803 --> 20:08.258
Me? Go to my office?

20:08.430 --> 20:10.387
It's highly irregular, but all right.

20:12.590 --> 20:14.514
You're not coming out
until you reach an agreement.

20:14.687 --> 20:16.763
- Let us out, Bart!
- This is not funny, Bart.

20:16.939 --> 20:19.430
- I mean it.
- Stop it, Bart! Let us out right now!

20:20.693 --> 20:23.693
- Don't worry. They'll start negotiating.
- Bart, open this door!

20:23.862 --> 20:27.907
- Let us out!
- For the love of God, let us out!

20:31.120 --> 20:34.156
Come on!
You are gonna be so sorry.

20:40.450 --> 20:43.497
- Let us out right now!
- You're gonna be very, very sorry!

20:43.882 --> 20:45.590
Help! Well...

20:45.759 --> 20:48.297
...Seymour, I guess we could
start talking.

20:48.470 --> 20:50.463
What's the point?
There's no more money...

20:50.681 --> 20:53.254
...unless you've got some magic
new source of revenue.

20:53.559 --> 20:56.595
We've got to figure it out.
We're locked in here like prisoners.

20:56.770 --> 20:59.590
Prisoners in our own school.

21:06.864 --> 21:08.903
This was a great way
to make extra money...

21:09.116 --> 21:12.200
...renting out our cloakrooms
to the overcrowded prison system.

21:12.411 --> 21:14.984
Yo. I used to sit right over there.

21:18.208 --> 21:20.996
It's all right, children.
Just ignore the murderer.

21:21.211 --> 21:24.470
And as a bonus, some of our more
troublesome students...

21:24.214 --> 21:26.207
...might be scared straight.

21:27.593 --> 21:30.166
Kid, help me break out of here.

21:30.346 --> 21:32.469
I'll totally make it worth your while.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.597
I'm listening.

22:29.279 --> 22:31.355
