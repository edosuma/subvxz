WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:03.011
It's too much.

00:03.095 --> 00:06.093
It is a very generous gesture.

00:06.095 --> 00:08.093
Sir Henry has a son.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.733
Quite the golden-haired child.

00:09.735 --> 00:10.733
And?

00:10.735 --> 00:12.853
Perhaps they're
looking for the right girl.

00:12.855 --> 00:14.373
Anna?

00:14.375 --> 00:16.813
Do women really have such thoughts?

00:16.815 --> 00:17.855
Yes.

00:19.095 --> 00:21.653
Doesn't mean that we should do them.

00:21.655 --> 00:25.733
Before we got married,
I was in love with someone.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.173
Someone totally wrong.

00:27.175 --> 00:30.575
What could have made him love
someone who is so wrong for him?

00:31.735 --> 00:33.575
I need to see who she is.

00:34.815 --> 00:37.813
That woman made a promise to James,
and to me!

00:37.815 --> 00:38.933
She saved his life.

00:38.935 --> 00:40.493
And now she threatens to ruin it.

00:40.495 --> 00:41.815
My husband was Jewish.

00:43.175 --> 00:44.655
Rene died...

00:46.935 --> 00:48.135
in Dachau.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.373
Anna's gone out, of all days!

03:10.375 --> 03:12.013
Mother, will you stop fussing?

03:12.015 --> 03:14.373
First impressions, George.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.375
Can't we just enjoy the weekend?

03:17.535 --> 03:19.093
Well?

03:19.095 --> 03:20.173
Apparently she's out riding.

03:20.175 --> 03:21.215
Oh.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.533
You made it. How was the journey?

03:35.535 --> 03:37.293
Long. I must say,
the roads around here...

03:37.295 --> 03:39.293
I know. I know.

03:39.295 --> 03:41.573
Now, you see, if you were
a local member, George...

03:41.575 --> 03:43.533
Oh, darling, you promised.
Incorrigible.

03:43.535 --> 03:44.933
It's been too long.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.573
It has.

03:46.575 --> 03:48.653
And finally, we get to see Ash Park.

03:48.655 --> 03:50.013
Not before time.

03:50.015 --> 03:51.733
And James. Oh, my goodness.

03:51.735 --> 03:53.613
All grown up. And married!

03:53.615 --> 03:55.093
My wife, Olivia.

03:55.095 --> 03:56.893
Lady Swanson.
Prudence, please.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.253
The reports weren't wrong.

03:58.255 --> 04:00.095
An English rose, indeed.

04:02.695 --> 04:04.453
Andrew, what are you doing in there?

04:04.455 --> 04:06.375
Can I answer that in polite society?

04:07.895 --> 04:09.535
He will have his little jokes.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.775
Nothing more sinister
than needing a refill.

04:14.895 --> 04:19.613
So... you, I'm guessing,
would be Anna.

04:19.615 --> 04:20.413
No.

04:20.415 --> 04:22.933
Unfortunately, Anna's been detained.

04:22.935 --> 04:23.933
Charity work.

04:23.935 --> 04:24.975
At the hospital.

04:28.815 --> 04:30.893
Your mother won't be happy.

04:30.895 --> 04:31.933
I'm making a point.

04:31.935 --> 04:33.253
I think you should go back.

04:33.255 --> 04:34.453
You don't want me here?

04:34.455 --> 04:35.613
It'll seem rude.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.053
I'd much rather be here with you.

04:37.055 --> 04:39.133
I'd much rather you were here,
but...

04:39.135 --> 04:40.293
Look who it is!

04:40.295 --> 04:41.453
The dago hound dog!

04:41.455 --> 04:42.533
Whoo!

04:42.535 --> 04:44.453
Sure you want a real Aussie?

04:44.455 --> 04:48.373
Looks like dago hound dog's
got the scent of a pedigree bitch!

04:48.375 --> 04:49.815
Whoo!

04:53.975 --> 04:55.933
Do you know him?

04:55.935 --> 04:58.093
Bert Forth.
He used to work for you.

04:58.095 --> 04:59.133
Did he?

04:59.135 --> 05:00.533
Your dad fired him.

05:00.535 --> 05:01.693
Why?

05:01.695 --> 05:03.173
Why do you think?

05:03.175 --> 05:04.773
Alright. Don't go picking a fight.

05:04.775 --> 05:05.855
After what he said?

05:07.215 --> 05:08.573
Please.

05:08.575 --> 05:09.775
Gino, promise me.

05:11.815 --> 05:13.295
I promise.

05:18.775 --> 05:20.376
Think I should have
made my point by now.

05:21.295 --> 05:22.655
I'll let you know how it goes.

05:24.695 --> 05:25.695
Good luck.

05:28.375 --> 05:30.813
Alma said you wanted to see me.

05:30.815 --> 05:32.253
Sit.

05:32.255 --> 05:33.855
Close the door.

05:42.455 --> 05:44.013
Look...

05:44.015 --> 05:45.253
As doctors and nurses,

05:45.255 --> 05:47.655
the human body is something
we deal with every day.

05:48.735 --> 05:50.575
There's nothing shameful about it.

05:52.815 --> 05:53.815
You were seen...

05:55.575 --> 05:57.253
swimming in the creek.

05:57.255 --> 05:58.853
I wasn't swimming.

05:58.855 --> 06:00.853
But you were naked.

06:00.855 --> 06:03.853
Different actions have different
meanings in different contexts.

06:03.855 --> 06:05.333
Do you always have to be
so mysterious?

06:05.335 --> 06:07.733
Do people always have to jump to
the wrong conclusions?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.973
It's a country town, Sister.

06:09.975 --> 06:12.615
People talk.
All too often out of ignorance.

06:14.055 --> 06:17.213
Would it help if I explained
to the offended party?

06:17.215 --> 06:20.695
I'm not sure it's a party
you're inclined to explain to.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.853
Mrs Collins.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.333
Miss Adams.

06:31.335 --> 06:32.933
I was hoping to speak with you.

06:32.935 --> 06:33.933
Yeah?

06:33.935 --> 06:36.253
Look, I know we didn't get off to
the best of starts.

06:36.255 --> 06:39.013
Perhaps we can forget all that
and begin again.

06:39.015 --> 06:40.853
What's brought this on?

06:40.855 --> 06:42.813
Tomorrow is Yom Kippur.

06:42.815 --> 06:45.533
For people of my faith,
a time for various rituals.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.573
One is seeking atonement from God
and our fellow man.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.053
Oh, so this has nothing to do
with being spoken to

06:51.055 --> 06:54.893
by Dr Duncan about swimming nude
in broad daylight?

06:54.895 --> 06:56.173
It's one of the rituals.

06:56.175 --> 06:57.613
It's a Mikveh.

06:57.615 --> 06:58.733
A what?

06:58.735 --> 07:00.735
It's a ritual cleansing,
like a, um...

07:01.735 --> 07:03.333
Well, it's like a baptism.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.693
Nothing like any baptism
I've ever attended.

07:06.695 --> 07:09.135
Well, if it caused any offence,
please accept my apology.

07:10.615 --> 07:12.973
Let me offer you some advice.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.693
Next time you feel the need

07:14.695 --> 07:18.133
to indulge in one of your
strange religious frolics,

07:18.135 --> 07:20.093
do so somewhere more private.

07:20.095 --> 07:22.173
I'll keep that in mind.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.613
Good.

07:23.615 --> 07:24.615
Thank you.

07:25.975 --> 07:26.975
Good.

07:31.135 --> 07:32.173
Ah, thank you, Amy.

07:32.175 --> 07:34.213
You didn't have to do this
as well.

07:34.215 --> 07:36.733
Yes, the gramophone was
more than generous.

07:36.735 --> 07:39.053
Prudence. Sir Henry. Thank you.

07:39.055 --> 07:40.093
I had a hand in it.

07:40.095 --> 07:41.613
Thank you all.

07:41.615 --> 07:42.933
More records.

07:42.935 --> 07:44.613
There's little point
giving someone a gramophone

07:44.615 --> 07:46.573
with only one record to play.

07:46.575 --> 07:49.133
Can you... buy records in this
part of the world?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.813
I rather assumed not.

07:50.815 --> 07:53.373
Mother. I think we all
grasped your intention.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.773
Inverness is still without a music
store of its own, so thank you.

07:56.775 --> 07:58.133
It's mostly good music.

07:58.135 --> 08:00.053
Plus a few contemporary ones.

08:00.055 --> 08:01.093
Hank Williams.

08:01.095 --> 08:02.373
Andrew.
You heard of him?

08:02.375 --> 08:04.093
I told him to leave that one out.

08:04.095 --> 08:05.133
Don't be so stuffy.

08:05.135 --> 08:06.895
Well, it's inappropriate.
May I?

08:11.055 --> 08:13.413
'Your Cheatin' Heart'.

08:13.415 --> 08:14.893
We give them 'The Anniversary Waltz'

08:14.895 --> 08:17.853
and he gives them a song
about infidelity.

08:17.855 --> 08:19.213
I call that poor taste.

08:19.215 --> 08:21.013
He thinks I'm old-fashioned.

08:21.015 --> 08:22.535
Could this be your daughter?

08:25.695 --> 08:26.813
Greetings, all.

08:26.815 --> 08:28.933
My darling. Finally.

08:28.935 --> 08:30.253
Ah, Henry.

08:30.255 --> 08:31.893
Good morning, my dear.

08:31.895 --> 08:33.053
And Prudence!

08:33.054 --> 08:35.215
Sir Henry and Lady Swanson.

08:36.455 --> 08:38.053
And you must be Andrew.

08:38.054 --> 08:39.453
Pleasure to meet you.

08:39.455 --> 08:41.613
I've heard so much about you.

08:41.615 --> 08:44.333
I've heard so much about you too.

08:44.335 --> 08:46.093
Darling, wouldn't you be
more comfortable

08:46.095 --> 08:47.613
out of those riding clothes?

08:47.615 --> 08:50.053
No, I like trousers.

08:50.055 --> 08:51.853
Oh, good. I'm parched.

08:51.855 --> 08:53.615
All that charity work?

08:56.135 --> 08:58.335
So exhausting.

09:17.655 --> 09:20.493
How long have you been
sitting there like that?

09:20.495 --> 09:21.853
Not long.

09:21.855 --> 09:23.373
You look a bit down in the dumps.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.333
I'm just thinking.

09:25.335 --> 09:27.573
About forgiveness.

09:27.575 --> 09:29.095
Righto.

09:34.735 --> 09:35.735
No, thanks.

09:37.975 --> 09:39.495
Aaahhh.

09:44.095 --> 09:46.013
Aahh.

09:46.015 --> 09:47.295
That's the doctor.

09:50.895 --> 09:53.413
Has it got anything to do
with your Yom Whatchy?

09:53.415 --> 09:54.613
Yes.

09:54.615 --> 09:57.493
Let me see
if I've got this straight.

09:57.495 --> 10:00.173
You go around apologising to anyone
you ever done wrong by,

10:00.175 --> 10:02.293
and from sundown tomorrow
you do bugger-all.

10:02.295 --> 10:04.053
You don't eat or drink,

10:04.055 --> 10:05.933
and you're just meant to pray
and feel miserable all day.

10:05.935 --> 10:06.933
That about it?

10:06.935 --> 10:08.573
In fairly broad terms, yes.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.293
I got that from Isaac Gold.

10:10.295 --> 10:11.613
I doubt he'd put it quite like that.

10:11.615 --> 10:13.293
What it boils down to.

10:13.295 --> 10:16.013
It's the holiest day
in the Jewish calendar.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.133
Seek forgiveness.

10:17.135 --> 10:18.415
Seek to forgive.

10:19.415 --> 10:22.213
You just tell me what I have to do
and I'll do it.

10:22.215 --> 10:23.613
Anything to help.

10:23.615 --> 10:26.573
Someone who acts as
if it's vaguely normal.

10:26.575 --> 10:28.695
If it makes sense to you,
it makes sense to me.

10:30.855 --> 10:32.975
I guess it makes you feel close
to your hubby too, eh?

10:34.415 --> 10:35.933
Yeah.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.055
Like Anzac Day does me the boys.

10:47.295 --> 10:51.253
Rene and I were working for
the Resistance in Paris.

10:51.255 --> 10:54.135
It was just before Yom Kippur
that we were arrested.

10:55.695 --> 10:57.015
1942.

10:58.615 --> 11:00.735
That was the last time
I ever saw him.

11:06.255 --> 11:08.095
Is that beer still going?

11:09.495 --> 11:10.975
I'll get you a glass.

They're waiting.

12:32.393 --> 12:33.753
Thank you.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.913
I've been thinking.

12:38.995 --> 12:40.193
About?

12:40.195 --> 12:41.993
Our child.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.553
His name.

12:43.555 --> 12:47.273
I thought we decided,
assuming it's a boy.

12:47.275 --> 12:50.633
I'm not sure William is appropriate.

12:50.635 --> 12:52.713
It was your idea after your father.

12:52.715 --> 12:54.475
And my brother.

12:55.715 --> 12:57.955
Do you mind if we don't
call him after William?

12:59.355 --> 13:02.073
Darling,
whatever name makes you happy.

13:02.075 --> 13:04.033
Better check what my errant sister
is up to.

13:04.035 --> 13:07.113
So you're not intent
on the name William?

13:07.115 --> 13:08.195
I said so, didn't I?

13:12.275 --> 13:13.755
You look exquisite.

13:25.635 --> 13:26.833
You can't be serious.

13:26.835 --> 13:28.035
Why? What do you mean?

13:28.995 --> 13:30.993
Honestly.
It's an old favourite.

13:30.995 --> 13:32.033
No, it's just old.

13:32.035 --> 13:34.193
And you're not being
the least bit subtle.

13:34.195 --> 13:36.673
One can't please everyone.

13:36.675 --> 13:38.193
Grandmother will see
right through it.

13:38.195 --> 13:39.193
Mmm.

13:39.195 --> 13:41.033
It'll make her even more determined
to bring you to heel.

13:41.035 --> 13:43.633
It was bad enough being dragged
around London like some trophy.

13:43.635 --> 13:45.473
I'm not going to let her
start that here.

13:45.475 --> 13:47.473
She sees it as her job.

13:47.475 --> 13:50.193
This is Australia 1953,
for goodness' sake.

13:50.195 --> 13:51.913
And she's manning the barricades
against change.

13:51.915 --> 13:52.913
Why?

13:52.915 --> 13:56.033
So we women can continue to have
dismal choices forced upon us?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.913
Andrew Swanson is hardly dismal.

13:57.915 --> 13:59.595
That dress, however, is.

14:00.635 --> 14:02.955
What happened to
making your own choices?

14:05.835 --> 14:07.273
He doesn't seem that bad.

14:07.275 --> 14:09.113
That's all.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.993
Come on.

14:10.995 --> 14:13.833
It won't be the first time
the royals have visited our shores.

14:13.835 --> 14:16.473
But she'll be the first
reigning monarch.

14:16.475 --> 14:19.753
The festivities around it
will be marvellous.

14:19.755 --> 14:21.193
She's so radiant.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.193
So young.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.273
They're not coming until next year.

14:24.275 --> 14:27.553
He thinks there's something wrong
with being excited about
seeing one's queen.

14:27.555 --> 14:28.713
I didn't say that.

14:28.715 --> 14:30.833
You would have been there
for the coronation.

14:30.835 --> 14:32.273
Oh, it was splendid.

14:32.275 --> 14:33.633
You attended the abbey?

14:33.635 --> 14:36.193
Hardly.
Olivia's parents were there.

14:36.195 --> 14:38.473
Of course. They're related.

14:38.475 --> 14:39.473
Yes, they are.

14:39.475 --> 14:40.475
Distantly.

14:42.035 --> 14:43.993
We'll go in to dinner as soon as...

14:43.995 --> 14:45.195
Ah, here they are.

14:51.715 --> 14:53.713
Well...

14:53.715 --> 14:56.193
Aren't you a sight to behold.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.515
I believe
I'm on your arm for the evening.

14:59.995 --> 15:01.473
Shall we lead the way?

15:01.475 --> 15:02.595
Please.

15:11.115 --> 15:13.475
I'm going to kill her.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.553
I'll take that as a compliment.

15:18.555 --> 15:20.833
Sorry.

15:20.835 --> 15:22.955
I've been living on me own too long.

15:24.395 --> 15:25.475
Thanks.

15:28.555 --> 15:30.273
Suppose you'll be wanting
to get a place of your own

15:30.275 --> 15:31.675
now you've decided to stay.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.073
Suppose so, yes.

15:35.075 --> 15:36.353
You are staying, aren't you?

15:36.355 --> 15:38.273
If I'm not run out of town.

15:38.275 --> 15:39.393
By Doris Collins?

15:39.395 --> 15:40.675
Among others.

15:41.915 --> 15:44.353
She probably thinks
we're living in sin.

15:44.355 --> 15:45.473
No doubt.

15:45.475 --> 15:47.073
Doesn't bother ya?

15:47.075 --> 15:48.795
She already thinks I'm a pagan.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.955
Bugger the lot of them, I say.

15:56.195 --> 15:57.355
Why not stay on here?

15:58.835 --> 15:59.835
Permanent.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.273
Ray, that's a very kind offer.

16:04.275 --> 16:06.035
I didn't say rent-free.

16:07.075 --> 16:08.435
Not much of a palace, but...

16:09.915 --> 16:11.355
Lucky seems to like it.

16:13.755 --> 16:14.995
Anyway...

16:16.555 --> 16:17.955
you think about it.

16:19.355 --> 16:20.355
No rush.

16:27.555 --> 16:29.713
Oh, aren't the flower girls divine?

16:29.715 --> 16:31.193
Olivia's nieces.

16:31.195 --> 16:32.473
Six and four.

16:32.475 --> 16:33.913
Oh, charming.

16:33.915 --> 16:36.353
Oh. And the best man.

16:36.355 --> 16:38.073
Do I see a family resemblance?

16:38.075 --> 16:39.553
My brother.

16:39.555 --> 16:40.713
So handsome.

16:40.715 --> 16:42.433
And you met James through him?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.473
She did.

16:43.475 --> 16:45.835
Oh, so romantic.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.353
I'm sorry.

16:50.355 --> 16:52.633
Would it be rude of me
to retire early?

16:52.635 --> 16:54.473
You're not unwell?

16:54.475 --> 16:55.913
Simply tired.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.193
Oh,
you mustn't stay up on our account.

16:58.195 --> 16:59.715
We'll see you in the morning.

17:01.195 --> 17:02.675
Sleep well, my dear.

17:04.635 --> 17:06.193
The first 12 weeks.

17:06.194 --> 17:07.315
Yes.

17:13.994 --> 17:15.795
What is it with old men and cigars?

17:17.275 --> 17:19.635
What is it with young men
and cigarettes?

17:21.275 --> 17:22.792
No, thank you.

17:22.795 --> 17:23.994
Horrible things.

17:31.355 --> 17:32.913
Have you always lived here?

17:32.915 --> 17:35.433
No. I was a boarder in the city.

17:35.435 --> 17:36.913
Before you went to Europe?

17:36.915 --> 17:38.113
Yes.

17:38.115 --> 17:39.555
But you prefer it here?

17:41.075 --> 17:42.595
I should get back inside.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.435
You know, I loathe these silly games
as much as you do.

17:50.715 --> 17:52.195
A ride before breakfast?

17:57.475 --> 17:58.555
Why not?

18:33.995 --> 18:35.395
Amy?

18:37.075 --> 18:38.073
Yes, ma'am?

18:38.075 --> 18:39.193
Has anyone risen yet?

18:39.195 --> 18:40.193
Yes.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.353
Mr George and Sir Henry
are out walking.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.993
And Miss Anna...
Where is she?

18:43.995 --> 18:46.193
Out riding...
Oh, for goodness' sake.

18:46.195 --> 18:48.153
With young Mr Andrew.

18:48.155 --> 18:49.273
Oh.

18:49.275 --> 18:50.475
Ah.

19:19.635 --> 19:20.633
Ma'am?

19:20.635 --> 19:23.073
Yes.
Someone here to see you.

19:23.075 --> 19:24.195
Miss Adams.

19:26.795 --> 19:28.553
This is ridiculous.

19:28.555 --> 19:30.635
She said she's happy
to wait at your convenience.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.913
Show her in.

19:33.915 --> 19:35.353
Tea for two?

19:35.355 --> 19:36.395
For one.

19:51.275 --> 19:55.073
I can't imagine what brings you here
at this unreasonable hour.

19:55.075 --> 19:56.595
I hoped to see you before work.

19:58.915 --> 20:01.155
I would like to clear the air
between us.

20:02.355 --> 20:04.755
I'm not your only apology of late,
I hear.

20:05.995 --> 20:08.313
Some sort of religious rite,
am I correct?

20:08.315 --> 20:09.753
I assume you mean Mrs Collins.

20:09.755 --> 20:11.913
I did speak with her yesterday.

20:11.915 --> 20:16.033
I'd prefer
an expression of genuine regret,

20:16.035 --> 20:20.273
rather than a ritual obeisance
at the time of year for atonement.

20:20.275 --> 20:21.633
This is genuine.

20:21.635 --> 20:24.273
Your timing, however, is suspect.

20:24.275 --> 20:30.075
So tell me why exactly
you broke your promise to me.

20:31.195 --> 20:33.993
At the time, my intention was to
return to the city and...

20:33.995 --> 20:35.753
But you did promise

20:35.755 --> 20:38.313
to keep what happened to James
strictly between ourselves.

20:38.315 --> 20:40.033
Quite solemnly, as I recall.

20:40.035 --> 20:42.193
What does your religion
say about that?

20:42.195 --> 20:44.953
Mrs Bligh...
Why did you come here?

20:44.955 --> 20:47.233
A few ritual platitudes
and you're away,

20:47.235 --> 20:48.715
with your conscience salved.

20:49.755 --> 20:53.873
It seems to me your atonement
is rather a hollow affair.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.755
A life is more important
than a promise.

20:56.915 --> 20:58.753
I was worried for James.

20:58.755 --> 21:00.673
He had my shoulder to lean on.

21:00.675 --> 21:02.273
He still does.

21:02.275 --> 21:03.993
He needs his father's too.

21:03.995 --> 21:06.073
He has that now.

21:06.075 --> 21:08.315
I don't know
if it's to do with your faith...

21:09.875 --> 21:11.915
but there's something
very lost about you.

21:15.595 --> 21:18.953
A wandering Jew can clearly be
a very dangerous entity.

21:18.955 --> 21:20.475
I should leave.
Yes, you should.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.873
Are you alright?

21:23.875 --> 21:24.953
It's nothing.

21:24.955 --> 21:25.953
Perhaps you should sit down.

21:25.955 --> 21:27.595
It's nothing. Go! Now!

21:35.635 --> 21:37.033
Where's Mr Bligh?

21:37.035 --> 21:38.033
At the sheds, I think.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.713
See to Mrs Bligh.
Did she ask for me?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.435
She needs you.

21:46.751 --> 21:49.309
10,000 head. Impressive.

21:49.311 --> 21:51.671
You can see why I don't have
the time to spare for politics.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.029
The next time you're in the city,
let's have dinner at the club.

21:55.031 --> 21:57.069
There are some matters
I'd like to discuss

21:57.071 --> 21:58.171
that are best got into

21:58.224 --> 22:01.264
away from the frivolities of
the ladies' romantic machinations.

22:02.384 --> 22:04.044
Mr Bligh.

22:04.061 --> 22:04.861
Excuse me.

22:04.933 --> 22:06.451
Ah, another one of
the local distractions.

22:06.453 --> 22:07.651
I'll keep walking.

22:07.653 --> 22:08.971
Sarah.

22:08.973 --> 22:10.331
My visit's upset your mother.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.693
She seems unwell.

22:12.653 --> 22:14.893
She should see Dr Duncan.
Thank you.

22:18.333 --> 22:19.611
Mr Bligh.

22:19.613 --> 22:20.891
Ah, George.

22:20.893 --> 22:23.211
Reverend Green wants us
to select the hymns for the service.

22:23.213 --> 22:24.531
I just saw Sarah.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.211
She thinks we should call Jack.

22:26.213 --> 22:27.613
She's wrong.

22:30.493 --> 22:32.931
No, really. I took a pill.
I'm feeling much better.

22:32.933 --> 22:34.171
No thanks to her.

22:34.173 --> 22:35.613
She's worried about you.

22:37.373 --> 22:40.211
She came here
to ask for forgiveness.

22:40.213 --> 22:42.691
The Jews, honestly.

22:42.693 --> 22:45.531
I know they gave us the Old
Testament, but some of their ways...

22:45.533 --> 22:47.291
It is Yom Kippur, Mother.

22:47.293 --> 22:48.853
It's all Greek to me.

22:50.973 --> 22:52.531
Elizabeth, George.

22:52.533 --> 22:55.291
I'm told Andrew and Anna
were up and away early.

22:55.293 --> 22:56.573
Riding.

22:57.573 --> 22:59.013
Oh, isn't that nice?

23:05.813 --> 23:07.091
How is she?

23:07.093 --> 23:08.731
Oh, she seems fine now.

23:08.733 --> 23:11.531
I know you have guests.
Don't let her take on too much.

23:11.533 --> 23:12.893
Thank you. I'll try.

23:15.173 --> 23:16.493
Not many in your position...

23:17.573 --> 23:19.011
would care what happened to her.

23:19.013 --> 23:20.851
Well, I'm partly to blame.

23:20.853 --> 23:22.091
For apologising?

23:22.093 --> 23:24.091
She took it as a ritual gesture.

23:24.093 --> 23:26.811
I doubt anything less than
a full acceptance of blame

23:26.813 --> 23:27.891
will satisfy her.

23:27.893 --> 23:29.653
She'll never have that.

23:30.573 --> 23:31.733
I didn't think so.

23:34.933 --> 23:37.533
So I'm going to have to be
somewhat discreet...

23:38.693 --> 23:40.811
if I'm to see you without
giving my mother conniptions.

23:40.813 --> 23:43.491
Wouldn't it be better if...
I am there to visit the dog, though.

23:43.493 --> 23:45.931
Ah, the dog. Yes.

23:45.933 --> 23:48.253
I'm finding our guests
somewhat wearing.

23:49.333 --> 23:50.651
How about tonight?

23:50.653 --> 23:54.051
I'm at the Goldbergs and then
no pleasure until sundown tomorrow.

23:54.053 --> 23:55.731
I am flattered.

23:55.733 --> 23:58.051
You consider my visit a pleasure.

23:58.053 --> 23:59.173
Of course I do.

24:00.733 --> 24:01.853
Tomorrow night.

24:02.933 --> 24:04.651
I'll look forward to that.

24:04.653 --> 24:05.773
Good.

24:20.333 --> 24:23.451
So this is your eastern boundary.

24:23.453 --> 24:25.411
Just down there.

24:25.413 --> 24:26.771
Whose grapevines?

24:26.773 --> 24:28.171
Italian family.

24:28.173 --> 24:31.251
After the war when they were freed,
Father gave them some freehold.

24:31.253 --> 24:32.571
Freed?

24:32.573 --> 24:33.971
Enemy aliens.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.851
Of course.

24:35.853 --> 24:37.051
Any good?

24:37.053 --> 24:38.331
They're lovely people.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.691
The wine.
Oh.

24:40.693 --> 24:42.171
You ever tasted any of it?

24:42.173 --> 24:43.531
Some.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.891
Not that our local wines
compare with Europe's.

24:45.893 --> 24:47.411
No.

24:47.413 --> 24:48.933
Not yet, anyway.

24:51.613 --> 24:52.733
Is that the maker?

24:54.053 --> 24:55.971
I might like to
have a word with him.

24:55.973 --> 24:58.251
No, we're late for breakfast
as it is.

24:58.253 --> 25:00.371
I thought we agreed
to enjoy ourselves.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.733
He's not the maker. His father is.

25:06.693 --> 25:08.133
I'll race you back.

25:58.293 --> 25:59.613
Andrew.

26:03.053 --> 26:04.051
You play well.

26:04.053 --> 26:05.411
Oh.

26:05.413 --> 26:09.171
It was considered an essential skill
when I was a young girl.

26:09.173 --> 26:10.971
Does Anna play?

26:10.973 --> 26:12.971
Times change.

26:12.973 --> 26:15.213
Well, goodnight, then.
Oh, stay.

26:16.013 --> 26:17.291
I was just about to retire.

26:17.293 --> 26:18.451
Please.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.693
We haven't had a chance
to speak all day.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.011
How was your ride this morning?

26:24.013 --> 26:25.051
We raced.

26:25.053 --> 26:26.653
Anna won. Both ways.

26:27.973 --> 26:29.173
I didn't mind at all.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.453
Of course.

26:32.813 --> 26:33.973
I like her.

26:35.013 --> 26:36.451
I'm pleased to hear it.

26:36.453 --> 26:41.893
But I don't respond well to being...
played any more than Anna does.

26:44.493 --> 26:47.611
So we should step back
and let nature take its course?

26:47.613 --> 26:48.693
Yes.

26:49.813 --> 26:51.493
And that course might be?

26:52.373 --> 26:54.373
Is there anyone else? Another man?

26:55.133 --> 26:56.371
No.

26:56.373 --> 26:57.971
Oh, trust me. The field is open.

26:57.973 --> 27:01.211
There isn't anyone around here
remotely suitable for her.

27:01.213 --> 27:02.733
I thought there might be.

27:03.893 --> 27:07.051
It's the way she's attracted,
but holds back.

27:07.053 --> 27:09.133
I often find that
in attached women.

27:11.613 --> 27:12.693
Absolutely not.

27:14.173 --> 27:15.891
You sound quite the Lothario.

27:15.893 --> 27:17.133
I've lived.

27:18.853 --> 27:20.331
Are you trying to shock me?

27:20.333 --> 27:21.931
I'm just being honest.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.493
I will keep in touch with her.

27:24.253 --> 27:25.493
Who knows?

27:27.173 --> 27:28.333
And you.

27:29.533 --> 27:30.573
Do you play?

27:32.533 --> 27:33.733
The piano.

27:34.973 --> 27:38.411
I retired when I was seven,
having mastered 'Chopsticks'.

27:38.413 --> 27:39.413
Ah!

27:40.613 --> 27:41.813
Pull up a chair.

27:44.933 --> 27:46.413
You may regret this.

27:48.493 --> 27:50.773
Nothing like a good duet.

28:05.813 --> 28:07.173
He's awfully handsome.

28:08.293 --> 28:09.451
Sorry?

28:09.453 --> 28:11.013
Andrew.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.211
If you say so.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.811
Don't pretend you haven't noticed.

28:15.813 --> 28:17.211
Not particularly.

28:17.213 --> 28:18.293
You men.

28:19.053 --> 28:22.611
I certainly have no problem
admitting another woman's beauty.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.451
Unless she's competing for
the same prize.

28:25.453 --> 28:29.091
Andrew isn't competition to you,
is he?

28:29.093 --> 28:30.733
I didn't think so.

28:30.962 --> 28:32.280
Then why be so coy?

28:32.282 --> 28:34.202
Darling, I'm trying to read.

28:37.442 --> 28:39.280
My brother never had that problem.

28:39.282 --> 28:43.840
In fact, I distinctly recall
his reaction upon meeting you.

28:43.842 --> 28:45.840
"Charming and handsome."

28:45.842 --> 28:47.400
Those were his words.

28:47.402 --> 28:48.920
Now I'm beginning to think he is.

28:48.922 --> 28:50.840
Is what? Who?

28:50.842 --> 28:52.882
Andrew. Competition.

28:54.922 --> 28:56.002
Come here.

28:58.802 --> 29:00.480
Darling...

29:00.482 --> 29:03.922
there is no-one in the world
more beautiful or charming than you.

29:09.242 --> 29:10.522
It's time to sleep.

29:12.762 --> 29:14.122
Goodnight.

29:32.522 --> 29:33.882
Gino!

29:38.522 --> 29:40.120
Gino?

29:40.122 --> 29:41.722
Come on. Take a rest.

29:43.802 --> 29:45.960
Waited for you all day yesterday.

29:45.962 --> 29:47.202
Well, I couldn't get away.

29:48.242 --> 29:49.363
You been having a nice time?

29:50.602 --> 29:52.160
Hmm?

29:52.162 --> 29:54.080
Well, it looked like you were.

29:54.082 --> 29:55.960
We were discussing the vineyard.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.440
He's interested in winemaking.

29:57.442 --> 30:00.160
Should have introduced us.
Well, he's not stupid.

30:00.162 --> 30:02.120
He would have sensed it. Us.

30:02.122 --> 30:04.322
Oh? Smart as well as rich, hmm?

30:05.602 --> 30:06.760
Your nonna's chosen well.

30:06.762 --> 30:08.800
I make my own choices.

30:08.802 --> 30:10.800
But he likes you, hmm?

30:10.802 --> 30:12.680
And you like him.

30:12.682 --> 30:14.760
No, not especially.
Not especially.

30:14.762 --> 30:16.322
No, not at all!

30:17.442 --> 30:18.642
You're being childish.

30:21.882 --> 30:23.762
I'm speaking to you.

30:30.962 --> 30:32.802
Well, at least he has manners.

30:50.162 --> 30:52.120
What you reading?
Oh.

30:52.122 --> 30:53.880
Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
No, it's fine.

30:53.882 --> 30:55.120
Poems.

30:55.122 --> 30:56.320
I think I might go for a walk.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.240
Mind if I have a squiz?

30:58.242 --> 30:59.562
A bit of a poet meself.

31:01.802 --> 31:02.922
Of course.

31:03.882 --> 31:05.042
Lorca.

31:06.242 --> 31:07.482
He and Rene were friends.

31:08.682 --> 31:11.322
He was shot
during the Spanish Civil War.

31:39.882 --> 31:41.602
Whoo! Hey!

31:42.842 --> 31:44.120
The dago hound dog!

31:44.122 --> 31:46.880
Hey, Gino! How's it going, mate?

31:46.882 --> 31:48.482
Well, that's not very friendly.

31:49.802 --> 31:52.122
Hey, how's that little bitch
of yours? She still on heat?

31:53.322 --> 31:54.960
What'd you say?

31:54.962 --> 31:58.520
I said, "How's that little bitch
of yours? Is she still on heat?"

31:58.522 --> 31:59.762
Come on, mate.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.520
Come on, mate. Come on, dago.
Have a go.

32:06.522 --> 32:08.122
Oh, you need a bigger target, mate.

32:09.962 --> 32:11.162
Ohh!

32:13.602 --> 32:15.202
One more for luck, hey?

32:16.122 --> 32:18.042
Hey, Gino. Gino.

32:19.122 --> 32:20.762
Smile for me, buddy.
Stop it!

32:22.482 --> 32:23.722
Ah!

32:26.962 --> 32:28.320
Are you alright?

32:28.322 --> 32:30.480
Bert, can you hear me?
What happened?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.162
Get out of here!

32:37.962 --> 32:41.120
Hey. You just got beaten by a girl.

32:41.122 --> 32:42.322
Shut your bloody gob!

32:44.682 --> 32:45.922
Crazy bitch.

32:51.242 --> 32:53.240
Who started it?
I wasn't there.

32:53.242 --> 32:54.960
It doesn't matter.

32:54.962 --> 32:56.562
Still reckon you should report it.

32:57.882 --> 33:00.320
If he doesn't want to.
Finished.

33:00.322 --> 33:01.522
For now.

33:02.402 --> 33:04.282
No hard yakka,
at least for the rest of the day.

33:06.882 --> 33:08.520
You should have seen
the way she downed him.

33:08.522 --> 33:10.362
I'll be out in a moment.

33:16.322 --> 33:18.400
Just as well Doris wasn't there.

33:18.402 --> 33:19.960
Skinny-dipping,
now public brawling.

33:19.962 --> 33:21.520
Believe me, I didn't want to.

33:21.522 --> 33:22.962
Taking on Bert, though.

33:24.322 --> 33:25.562
Where'd you learn how to fight?

33:26.442 --> 33:27.522
I got lucky.

33:28.762 --> 33:29.842
Really?

33:31.162 --> 33:33.240
Yeah, well, you watch Bert.

33:33.242 --> 33:34.762
Doubt you made a friend there.

33:46.122 --> 33:48.160
Almost time to break the fast.

33:48.162 --> 33:49.322
Almost.

33:51.242 --> 33:52.722
How'd you go with your forgiving?

33:53.802 --> 33:55.400
How'd you go with the poems?

33:55.402 --> 33:57.160
Oh, what do you reckon?

33:57.162 --> 33:58.440
That's Spanish, hey?

33:58.442 --> 33:59.600
Yes.

33:59.602 --> 34:00.840
Can you read that?

34:00.842 --> 34:02.082
Yes.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.240
What about you give us one?

34:04.242 --> 34:05.562
In English.

34:08.842 --> 34:10.960
This was Rene's favourite.

34:10.962 --> 34:12.722
Righto.

34:17.242 --> 34:19.202
"Tell my friends
that I've died.

34:20.882 --> 34:25.722
"Tell them that I'm out here
in the sky, my eyes wide open.

34:27.081 --> 34:30.081
"My face covered up
by this endless blue shroud.

34:31.522 --> 34:36.562
"That I've gone off, empty,
to the stars."

34:42.042 --> 34:44.362
Rene used to say
it reminded him of his friend.

34:47.202 --> 34:49.322
Now it just reminds me of him.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.282
Excuse me.

34:59.122 --> 35:00.282
There you are.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.840
Just finished.

35:02.842 --> 35:04.840
It's time to dress for dinner.

35:04.842 --> 35:06.202
I got lost in this.

35:07.922 --> 35:09.160
Yes?

35:09.162 --> 35:11.322
Telegram, sir. For Mrs Bligh.

35:12.642 --> 35:14.080
Were you expecting something?

35:14.082 --> 35:15.122
No.

35:17.402 --> 35:18.920
They're not all bad.

35:18.922 --> 35:20.122
Open it, please.

35:21.282 --> 35:22.802
I'll take it.

35:31.682 --> 35:32.842
What is it?

35:36.562 --> 35:37.682
James?

35:39.282 --> 35:41.082
It is bad news, isn't it?

35:42.682 --> 35:45.920
No. It's... it's marvellous.

35:45.922 --> 35:47.642
It's William. He's engaged.

35:48.562 --> 35:50.560
To whom?
It doesn't say.

35:50.562 --> 35:51.602
Um, details to follow.

35:52.842 --> 35:54.122
I should dress.

36:02.773 --> 36:04.693
Do I really have to go?

36:04.722 --> 36:06.240
You most certainly do.

36:06.242 --> 36:07.720
Our guests would be insulted.

36:07.722 --> 36:09.120
Andrew won't care.

36:09.122 --> 36:10.240
It's true.

36:10.242 --> 36:11.360
And with his mother around,

36:11.362 --> 36:13.280
it's not as if I'm needed
to keep the conversation going.

36:13.282 --> 36:14.640
That's enough.

36:14.642 --> 36:16.720
My apologies.
I couldn't find my prayer book.

36:16.722 --> 36:18.800
Oh.
A gift from my grandmother.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.440
Printed in 1842.

36:20.442 --> 36:22.440
Among my most cherished possessions.

36:22.442 --> 36:23.802
Seem to have left mine at home.

36:24.962 --> 36:27.680
Oh, where's, um... Ah.

36:27.682 --> 36:30.240
Olivia sends her apologies.
She's feeling off colour.

36:30.242 --> 36:32.160
All the excitement, I expect.

36:32.162 --> 36:33.560
Last night's news.

36:33.562 --> 36:35.560
Perhaps I should stay
and keep her company.

36:35.562 --> 36:37.360
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.880
You'll be returning for lunch,
won't you, before you go home?

36:39.882 --> 36:41.160
I believe that's the plan.

36:41.162 --> 36:42.720
I'll see you back here, then.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.520
Anna.
Oh, settle, Grandmother.

36:45.522 --> 36:47.722
Anna.
Enjoy the service.

37:14.002 --> 37:15.200
Livy!

37:15.202 --> 37:17.160
James said that
you weren't feeling well.

37:17.162 --> 37:18.282
I lied.

37:19.242 --> 37:20.362
Oh.

37:21.442 --> 37:23.762
Well, if you need anything...
I'll call Amy.

37:26.442 --> 37:27.602
I'll be fine.

37:30.162 --> 37:31.602
Really. Thank you.

38:34.242 --> 38:35.682
I thought I might find you here.

38:38.642 --> 38:40.000
What happened?

38:40.002 --> 38:42.240
It's nothing. I was being stupid.

38:42.242 --> 38:43.842
Just fooling around.

38:45.882 --> 38:48.202
No, I'm the one who's been stupid.

38:50.002 --> 38:51.242
I'm so...

38:53.442 --> 38:55.442
It's you that I want.

39:04.722 --> 39:05.962
I do want you.

39:19.162 --> 39:21.160
I'm off to get my dose of religion.

39:21.162 --> 39:22.562
You could do with it.

39:32.002 --> 39:33.282
When I lost my boys...

39:34.642 --> 39:36.880
at first, I couldn't forgive
the bastards that done for them

39:36.882 --> 39:38.000
and I wanted to get over there

39:38.002 --> 39:39.962
and kill every one of them
with me bare hands.

39:41.522 --> 39:43.720
But at the end of the day,

39:43.722 --> 39:48.080
something didn't sit right
about me being here and them not

39:48.082 --> 39:50.402
and it was myself
I had to forgive.

39:55.802 --> 39:57.842
There's no shame in survival, lass.

40:05.642 --> 40:09.482
Right. Well, it's been a while,
so I better not keep God waiting.

40:11.002 --> 40:12.122
Roy...

40:15.162 --> 40:17.240
My aunt gave me a, um...

40:17.242 --> 40:20.082
a welcome mat to put out
when I found a place to call home.

40:22.602 --> 40:24.202
If you wouldn't mind...

40:26.322 --> 40:27.442
I'd be honoured.

40:28.482 --> 40:31.282
I'd be honoured
to wipe my boots on it.
