ATTACK.

01:13.893 --> 01:15.898
COOL MOVE, HUH?

01:15.899 --> 01:18.337
I LEARNED IT
FROM WATCHING YOU
TOSS PIZZAS.

01:18.338 --> 01:20.845
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MICHELANGELO?

01:20.846 --> 01:25.257
JUST SPRINKLE
SOME CHOPPED OLIVES
ON ME, AND I'LL BE FINE.

01:25.258 --> 01:27.062
VERY GOOD, RAPHAEL.

01:27.063 --> 01:29.336
LEONARDO, DONATELLO,
YOUR TURN.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.210
WAIT!

01:32.211 --> 01:33.480
<i>WHAT IS IT,
SENSEI?</i>

01:33.481 --> 01:36.556
I FEEL AS THOUGH
WE'RE BEING WATCHED,
SOMEHOW.

01:36.557 --> 01:38.227
THE RAT KING?

01:38.228 --> 01:40.300
NO.
BY SOMETHING

01:40.301 --> 01:42.641
OR SOMEONE
MORE ALIEN.

01:42.642 --> 01:43.944
NO MATTER.

01:43.945 --> 01:46.084
CONTINUE WITH
YOUR PRACTICE,
MY STUDENTS.

01:46.085 --> 01:47.621
Man: AT LAST!

01:47.622 --> 01:50.129
AFTER MONTHS
OF SEARCHING
THE SEWERS,

01:50.130 --> 01:52.001
I'VE FOUND
THE TURTLES.

01:52.002 --> 01:54.675
FINALLY, I'LL HAVE
MY REVENGE ON THEM

01:54.676 --> 01:57.249
FOR THEM LEAVING ME
IN THIS HORRIBLE STATE.

01:59.623 --> 02:01.628
AND NOT ONLY
ON THE TURTLES,

02:01.629 --> 02:05.004
BUT ON KRANG
AND SHREDDER, AS WELL.

02:07.513 --> 02:09.351
WHAT IS IT,
SHREDDER?

02:09.352 --> 02:12.660
I SUDDENLY FELT
THE PRESENCE OF
SOMEONE IN THE ROOM.

02:12.661 --> 02:13.963
BUT LET US CONTINUE.

02:13.964 --> 02:16.805
OUR BALLAST TANKS
ARE NEARLY EMPTY.

02:16.806 --> 02:20.215
AND THERE'S NOT
A LOT OF WATER
AT THE EARTH'S CORE.

02:22.322 --> 02:24.159
DID YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.897
NO, KRANG. YOU DID.

02:25.898 --> 02:27.335
OH, OF COURSE.

02:27.336 --> 02:29.676
I WAS MERELY
TESTING YOU.

02:29.677 --> 02:31.079
THIS IS THE PLAN.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.152
I WILL RAISE
THE TECHNODROME

02:33.153 --> 02:35.492
NEAR THIS
UNDERGROUND
RESERVOIR

02:35.493 --> 02:37.598
IN THE CITY'S
SEWER SYSTEM.

02:37.599 --> 02:40.941
THEN, WE'LL TAP IT
AND FILL THE TANKS.

02:40.942 --> 02:42.411
IN THE SEWERS?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.317
THAT MEANS
YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE TURTLES.

02:45.555 --> 02:48.897
THAT MEANS
YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE TURTLES.

02:48.898 --> 02:51.471
I'LL CONSIDER IT
A PLEASURE.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.042
EXCELLENT.

02:53.043 --> 02:55.616
ALL MY ENEMIES WILL BE
IN ONE PLACE.

02:55.617 --> 02:58.424
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR REVENGE.

02:58.425 --> 03:02.268
BUT FIRST,
I NEED TO COMPLETELY
RE-ENTER THIS DIMENSION.

03:02.269 --> 03:06.682
AND TO DO IT,
I'LL NEED A FEW GIGAVOLTS
OF ELECTRICITY.

03:06.683 --> 03:08.955
THIS SPIRE GETS STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING

03:08.956 --> 03:10.693
IN EVERY
ELECTRICAL STORM.

03:10.694 --> 03:13.133
I SIMPLY MUST
BE PATIENT.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.658
PHEW. I NEEDED THAT.

03:24.768 --> 03:25.970
IT WORKED.

03:25.971 --> 03:28.410
I'M BACK IN
THIS DIMENSION AGAIN.

03:29.414 --> 03:31.352
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO SHOW US, DONATELLO?

03:31.353 --> 03:34.227
I JUST BUILT
A GAMMA RAY
SONAR TRACKER.

03:34.228 --> 03:37.536
IT'LL HELP US KEEP TABS
ON THE TECHNODROME'S
MOVEMENTS.

03:37.537 --> 03:39.242
TERRIFIC,
DONATELLO.

03:39.243 --> 03:41.448
YOU'RE A TOTAL
TECHNO-TURTLE!

03:41.449 --> 03:43.954
SO, LIKE,
WHAT'S THIS GIZMO?

03:43.955 --> 03:46.228
NO, MICHELANGELO,
DON'T TOUCH THAT--

03:47.633 --> 03:49.471
SWITCH.

03:49.472 --> 03:50.808
OH, MAN!

03:50.809 --> 03:53.917
HOW DID I GET
FROM THERE TO HERE?

03:53.918 --> 03:55.923
COURTESY OF
MY LATEST INVENTION--

03:55.924 --> 03:57.527
THE RETRO-CATAPULT.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.870
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:00.871 --> 04:02.475
THE TECHNODROME
IS MOVING.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.979
IT'S HEADED
FOR THE SURFACE.

04:03.980 --> 04:07.355
LOOKS LIKE IT'S HEADED
FOR THE 9th STREET
RESERVOIR.

04:07.356 --> 04:09.661
HI, GUYS. AM I
INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

04:09.662 --> 04:12.737
NO, ONLY THE END
OF CIVILIZATION
AS WE KNOW IT.

04:12.738 --> 04:14.442
OH, LET ME GUESS--

04:14.443 --> 04:16.682
SHREDDER AND KRANG
ARE UP TO SOMETHING?

04:16.683 --> 04:18.988
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
AND WHAT THEY'RE UP TO

04:18.990 --> 04:21.529
IS THE ALLUVIAL LAYER
OF SUBSOIL.

04:21.531 --> 04:23.234
ENGLISH TRANSLATION?

04:23.235 --> 04:25.407
YEAH, THE TECHNODROME'S
ABOUT TO BUST

04:25.408 --> 04:26.945
THROUGH
THE EARTH'S CRUST.

04:26.946 --> 04:31.124
COME ON, TURTLES.
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
DEPENDS ON US!

04:31.125 --> 04:32.661
DON'T YOU WISH
YOU COULD DELIVER

04:32.662 --> 04:34.467
LINES LIKE THAT WITH
A STRAIGHT FACE?

04:36.674 --> 04:38.712
Shredder: WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

04:38.713 --> 04:40.484
Krang: THAT'S
AS CLOSE AS
WE CAN GET

04:40.485 --> 04:43.291
TO THE SURFACE WITH
THE POWER WE HAVE.

04:43.292 --> 04:46.067
YOU'LL HAVE TO USE
THE TRANSPORT
MODULES

04:46.068 --> 04:49.978
TO BORE HOLES
INTO THE WATER
STORAGE TANKS.

04:49.979 --> 04:51.950
I'LL GET
ROCKSTEADY AND BEBOP,

04:51.951 --> 04:53.622
AND WE'LL LEAVE
RIGHT AWAY.

04:53.623 --> 04:56.161
NOT THOSE
2 BUFFOONS!

04:56.162 --> 04:59.204
THEY ALWAYS MANAGE
TO FOUL THINGS UP.

04:59.205 --> 05:00.775
NOT THIS TIME.

05:00.776 --> 05:03.516
THEY'RE TAKING ONE OF THOSE
SELF-IMPROVEMENT COURSES

05:03.517 --> 05:04.719
ON VIDEOTAPE.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.890
WHAT'S IT ON,

05:05.891 --> 05:08.497
LOW-IMPACT
STUPIDITY?

05:08.498 --> 05:11.907
<i>REMEMBER, ANGER
IS COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE</i>

05:11.908 --> 05:13.311
<i>DON'T GET MAD.</i>

05:13.312 --> 05:15.250
<i>JUST GET
THE JOB DONE.</i>

05:15.251 --> 05:17.523
<i>TURN YOUR ENEMY
INTO YOUR FRIEND--</i>

05:17.524 --> 05:19.295
<i>YOUR PAL.</i>

05:19.296 --> 05:23.541
AH, GEE, I FEEL
MELLOWER ALREADY

05:23.542 --> 05:25.579
JUST LISTENING
TO THIS.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.020
HEY, DUMMY, WATCH
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

05:28.021 --> 05:29.791
OH, ZIP IT, WIMP!

05:29.792 --> 05:30.961
WIMP?

05:30.962 --> 05:33.402
I OUGHT
TO MAKE PORK CHOPS
OUT OF YOU!

05:33.403 --> 05:38.316
<i>JUST REPEAT
TO YOURSELF,
"I AM IN CONTROL.</i>

05:38.317 --> 05:40.923
<i>I AM IN CONTROL."</i>

05:40.924 --> 05:43.263
<i>AND YOU WILL BE.</i>

05:43.264 --> 05:45.972
Both:
I AM IN CONTROL.

05:45.973 --> 05:48.746
I AM IN CONTROL.

05:48.747 --> 05:50.384
Shredder:
ROCKSTEADY. BEBOP.

05:50.385 --> 05:53.460
GET YOUR FREEZE RAYS
AND COME HERE. NOW!

05:53.461 --> 05:56.535
I GUESS SHREDDER'S
IN CONTROL.

05:56.536 --> 05:58.541
SO, WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

06:02.821 --> 06:04.524
THIS IS THE UNDERGROUND
RESERVOIR

06:04.525 --> 06:06.898
THAT
THE TECHNODROME SEEMS
TO BE HEADING FOR.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.570
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU SUPPOSE KRANG

06:08.571 --> 06:11.009
AND SHREDDER WANT
WITH ALL THAT WATER?

06:11.010 --> 06:14.520
MAYBE THEY'RE PLANNING
ON GIVING ROCKSTEADY
AND BEBOP A BATH.

06:15.858 --> 06:18.131
THIS REPORTER'S GOING
TO LOOK AROUND.

06:18.132 --> 06:19.702
DON'T
WANDER TOO FAR.

06:19.703 --> 06:22.610
DON'T WORRY.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
DOWN HERE?

06:22.611 --> 06:24.414
APRIL O'NEILL!

06:24.415 --> 06:28.125
WHAT BETTER WAY
TO LAUNCH MY REVENGE
AGAINST THE TURTLES

06:28.126 --> 06:30.967
THAN KIDNAPPING
THEIR CLOSEST FRIEND?

06:30.968 --> 06:33.541
GEE GUYS,
THIS IS REALLY BORING.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.246
I WISH SOMETHING
WOULD HAPP--

06:35.247 --> 06:37.653
YOU WISH SOMETHING
WOULD WHAT, APRIL?

06:37.654 --> 06:40.260
YEAH, YOU REALLY GOT
TO LEARN TO FINISH
YOUR SENTENCES.

06:40.261 --> 06:41.665
SHE'S GONE!

06:41.666 --> 06:43.503
APRIL!
WHERE ARE YOU?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.475
Michelangelo:
YO, APRIL!

06:45.476 --> 06:47.548
WHERE'D
YOU SPLIT TO?

06:47.549 --> 06:49.553
HELP!

06:52.162 --> 06:54.100
MMM! HELP!

06:54.101 --> 06:55.972
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
COOPERATE.

06:55.973 --> 06:58.212
IT'S USELESS
TO STRUGGLE.

06:58.213 --> 06:59.884
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

06:59.885 --> 07:02.056
I WANT
THE TURTLES
TO FIND US--

07:02.057 --> 07:03.561
BUT NOT JUST YET.

07:04.865 --> 07:07.639
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S GOT APRIL.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.110
COME ON, TURTLES!

07:09.111 --> 07:13.087
YEAH. IT'S
THE GREEN GOOD GUYS
TO THE RESCUE.

07:13.088 --> 07:16.398
OH, NOW WHAT?
AN EARTHQUAKE?

07:16.399 --> 07:17.901
NO, WRONG, DUDE.

07:17.902 --> 07:20.108
IT'S
A SHREDDER-QUAKE.

07:20.109 --> 07:22.047
QUICK!
TAKE COVER!

07:22.048 --> 07:23.484
WELL, ROCKSTEADY.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.794
YOU ONCE, YOU'VE
BROUGHT THE MODULE UP
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

07:26.795 --> 07:28.933
GEE, THANKS, BOSS.

07:28.934 --> 07:32.877
IT MUST'VE BEEN THEM
SELF-IMPROVEMENT TAPES
I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO.

07:32.878 --> 07:34.650
OK, SHREDDER.

07:34.651 --> 07:36.488
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH APRIL?

07:36.489 --> 07:38.159
THE TURTLES!

07:38.160 --> 07:40.065
WHERE'D THEY COME FROM?

07:40.066 --> 07:41.903
I TAKE IT BACK.

07:41.904 --> 07:44.879
COMING UP
IN THIS SPOT
WAS A STUPID IDEA.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.049
FREEZE THEM!

07:48.924 --> 07:50.629
SO, LIKE, NEXT TIME,

07:50.630 --> 07:52.401
HOW ABOUT
WE CLOBBER THEM FIRST,

07:52.402 --> 07:54.272
AND THEN ASK QUESTIONS.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.476
JUST WHO ARE YOU,

07:55.477 --> 07:57.616
AND WHAT DO
YOU WANT FROM ME?

07:57.617 --> 07:59.789
FROM YOU? NOTHING.

07:59.790 --> 08:03.165
YOU ARE MERELY THE HONEY
TO LURE THE TURTLES

08:03.166 --> 08:05.204
INTO MY FLYTRAP.

08:05.205 --> 08:07.210
WELL, IT ISN'T GOING
TO WORK.

08:07.211 --> 08:09.918
THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT
SHREDDER USED TO TELL ME.

08:09.919 --> 08:12.959
BUT THIS TIME,
I WILL BE REVENGED!

08:15.735 --> 08:19.812
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
HE'D BE A FRIEND
OF SHREDDER'S.

08:19.813 --> 08:22.320
WHEN THOSE TURTLES
BREATHE THIS GAS,

08:22.321 --> 08:25.496
IT'LL BE ALL OVER
FOR THEM. HA HA!

08:26.633 --> 08:28.270
COME ON OUT,
SHELLBACKS,

08:28.271 --> 08:31.679
AND GET FITTED
FOR ICE OVERCOATS.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.053
MAN, THOSE GUYS
REALLY FROST ME.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.991
ME, TOO.
I THINK IT'S TIME

08:35.993 --> 08:38.366
WE HEATED THINGS UP
A LITTLE.

08:39.570 --> 08:41.140
WHAT?
OH!

08:43.080 --> 08:46.087
OK, LET'S GET 'EM.

08:46.088 --> 08:48.628
All: TURTLE POWER!

08:51.504 --> 08:53.877
I CAN'T SEE
A BLASTED THING.

08:53.878 --> 08:55.381
RETREAT!

08:55.382 --> 08:57.554
PRETTY SLICK
GETAWAY.

08:57.555 --> 08:59.092
ONE THING'S FOR SURE--

08:59.093 --> 09:02.067
TURTLE TOOTSIES
WEREN'T MADE FOR ICE.

09:02.068 --> 09:05.076
WE'VE GOT TO FIND APRIL
BEFORE SHREDDER RETURNS.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.917
MAYBE I CAN PICK UP
HER TURTLECOM SIGNAL.

09:09.589 --> 09:10.926
THERE!

09:10.927 --> 09:13.432
IT'S COMING
FROM THAT PASSAGEWAY.

09:16.342 --> 09:18.714
EVERYTHING IS
GOING PERFECTLY.

09:18.715 --> 09:21.022
SOON, THE TURTLES
WILL BE MY PRISONERS,

09:21.023 --> 09:22.258
AND THEN I'LL...

09:22.259 --> 09:23.595
I'LL...

09:23.596 --> 09:25.166
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'LL DO.

09:25.167 --> 09:26.804
BUT I KNOW
THEY'LL HATE IT.

09:29.614 --> 09:31.484
FOUND IT, DUDES.

09:31.485 --> 09:33.490
THAT'S APRIL'S
TURTLECOM, ALL RIGHT.

09:33.491 --> 09:35.998
OH, SHE MUST HAVE
DROPPED IT.

09:35.999 --> 09:38.171
OR SOMEONE MADE HER
DROP IT.

09:38.172 --> 09:40.243
WE'VE GOT
TO KEEP SEARCHING.

09:41.246 --> 09:43.720
THERE SURE ARE
A LOT OF RATS AROUND

09:43.721 --> 09:45.157
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

09:45.158 --> 09:46.594
NO DUH.

09:46.595 --> 09:49.202
AND WHERE
THERE'S RATS,
THERE'S...

09:49.203 --> 09:51.609
All:
THE RAT KING!

09:51.610 --> 09:56.088
YOU MAY ADDRESS ME
AS YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

09:56.089 --> 09:58.930
WILL YOU SETTLE FOR
YOUR ROYAL PAIN?

09:58.931 --> 10:02.975
AND WHY ARE YOU TURTLES
INTRUDING IN MY KINGDOM?

10:02.976 --> 10:06.886
DO YOU WISH TO BATTLE
MY ARMY OF LOYAL RATS?

10:06.887 --> 10:08.892
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR APRIL O'NEILL.

10:08.893 --> 10:10.463
SHE'S
BEEN KIDNAPPED.

10:10.464 --> 10:14.040
AH, APRIL O'NEILL.
HA HA HA.

10:14.041 --> 10:15.377
I REMEMBER HER.

10:15.378 --> 10:17.818
SHE HAD
VERY PRETTY FUR--

10:17.819 --> 10:20.425
I MEAN, HAIR.

10:20.426 --> 10:22.598
I SUPPOSE
YOU WANT MY HELP.

10:22.599 --> 10:24.503
RIGHT NOW, WE'D TAKE
ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.743
ALL RIGHT.
FOLLOW ME.

10:31.357 --> 10:34.298
HEY, DO YOU
REALLY TRUST
HIS ROYAL WACKINESS?

10:34.299 --> 10:35.802
DO WE HAVE A CHOICE?

10:37.374 --> 10:39.011
HURRY
WITH THAT EQUIPMENT.

10:39.012 --> 10:41.887
WE MUST DRAIN THE WATER
BEFORE THE TURTLES RETURN.

10:41.888 --> 10:43.825
RIGHT, BOSS.

10:45.932 --> 10:47.703
WHY, YOU
CLUMSY CREEP!

10:47.704 --> 10:49.341
WHY, I OUGHT TO--

10:49.342 --> 10:50.645
NOW, NOW.

10:50.646 --> 10:52.784
REMEMBER WHAT
THE TAPE SAID.

10:52.785 --> 10:56.628
YOU GOT TO CONTROL
YOUR TEMPER...PAL.

10:56.629 --> 10:59.370
OOH, I AM
IN CONTROL.

10:59.371 --> 11:01.777
I AM IN CONTROL...

11:01.778 --> 11:03.013
BUDDY.

11:03.014 --> 11:04.484
HURRY AND ATTACH
THAT EQUIPMENT!

11:04.485 --> 11:06.624
YOU'RE WASTING
VALUABLE TIME!

11:06.625 --> 11:08.095
CAREFULLY!

11:08.096 --> 11:10.168
ONE SLIP, AND
WE'LL BE WASHED AWAY

11:10.169 --> 11:12.274
BY 10 MILLION GALLONS
OF WATER.

11:13.745 --> 11:18.091
DON'T TURN ON THE WATER
TILL I TELL YOU, OLD PAL.

11:18.092 --> 11:21.600
RIGHT, OLD BUDDY.

11:23.106 --> 11:26.414
WHA--!

11:26.415 --> 11:28.520
STOP!
GET ME DOWN!

11:28.521 --> 11:32.699
TURN OFF THE WATER!

11:32.700 --> 11:35.206
GET DOWN FROM THERE,
YOU PINHEAD!

11:43.364 --> 11:44.533
WHAT?

11:44.534 --> 11:46.404
I RECOGNIZE
THAT SOUND.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.243
QUICKLY! TAKE COVER!

11:52.089 --> 11:53.792
JUST AS I THOUGHT--

11:53.793 --> 11:55.531
BAXTER STOCKMAN.

11:55.532 --> 11:57.871
HMM. HE MIGHT COME
IN HANDY.

12:00.881 --> 12:03.721
MY FLY SENSE TELLS ME
THAT SHREDDER
AND HIS MUTANTS

12:03.722 --> 12:05.024
ARE HERE SOMEWHERE.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.696
WHAT?

12:06.697 --> 12:08.200
YOU TWO HOLD HIM.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.844
SO, WE MEET
AGAIN, SHREDDER.

12:11.845 --> 12:14.685
PREPARE TO TASTE
MY REVENGE.

12:14.686 --> 12:18.296
PRETTY CORNY DIALOGUE,
AIN'T IT?

12:18.297 --> 12:19.867
HEY,
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT

12:19.868 --> 12:23.545
FROM SOMEBODY WHO
WASHES HIS FACE
WITH HIS ELBOWS?

12:23.546 --> 12:25.651
RELEASE HIM
AT ONCE.

12:25.652 --> 12:28.292
BAXTER,
I'M TERRIBLY HURT.

12:28.293 --> 12:31.634
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
REVENGE ON ME?
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

12:31.635 --> 12:35.245
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
THAT'S HOW YOU FOOLED ME
THE LAST TIME.

12:35.246 --> 12:37.853
BAXTER,
YOU WOUND ME DEEPLY.

12:37.854 --> 12:40.226
WHY, I LOOK
UPON YOU AS A SON.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.432
A EXTREMELY
WEIRD-LOOKING SON.

12:42.433 --> 12:44.338
THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M A FREAK.

12:44.339 --> 12:46.076
AND IT'S ALL
YOUR FAULT.

12:46.077 --> 12:48.449
YOU AND THOSE
BLASTED TURTLES.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.623
I CAN HELP YOU,
BAXTER.

12:50.624 --> 12:52.661
I'LL TAKE YOU BACK
TO THE TECHNODROME

12:52.662 --> 12:55.235
WHERE YOU CAN BE MADE
NORMAL AGAIN.

12:55.236 --> 12:56.640
YOU'D DO THAT
FOR ME?

12:56.641 --> 12:58.478
OF COURSE.

12:58.479 --> 13:00.417
IN RETURN,
ALL I ASK IS THAT

13:00.418 --> 13:02.055
YOU HELP ME
TRAP THE TURTLES.

13:02.056 --> 13:05.899
I'VE A FLY FEELING
I'LL REGRET THIS,
BUT I'LL DO IT.

13:05.900 --> 13:09.175
YOU'VE MADE
A WISE CHOICE,
BAXTER.

13:09.176 --> 13:11.849
NOW, LET'S
TALK TURTLES,
SHALL WE?

13:14.358 --> 13:17.131
UGH. THIS IS
THE THIRD TUNNEL
WE'VE CHECKED,

13:17.132 --> 13:19.539
AND STILL NO SIGN
OF APRIL.

13:19.540 --> 13:22.180
EVEN THE RAT KING SEEMS
TO HAVE GIVEN UP.

13:22.181 --> 13:25.054
WRONG.
DON'T DESPAIR, TURTLES.

13:25.055 --> 13:28.397
MY ROYAL RATS AND I
ARE ON THE JOB.

13:28.398 --> 13:31.339
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW REASSURING
THAT IS.

13:31.340 --> 13:35.050
YEAH. IT, LIKE, GIVES ME
TURTLE BUMPS ALL OVER.

13:40.098 --> 13:42.437
EXCELLENT WORK, MICKEY.

13:44.009 --> 13:46.482
WE ALL HAVE
OUR ROLE MODELS.

13:46.483 --> 13:48.588
OUR SEARCH IS ENDED.

13:48.589 --> 13:51.229
YOUR FRIEND APRIL O'NEILL
IS BEING HELD CAPTIVE

13:51.230 --> 13:54.772
IN THE OLD 7th STREET
SUBWAY STATION. HA HA.

13:54.773 --> 13:55.943
FOLLOW ME.

13:57.414 --> 13:58.584
Donatello:
I CAN'T BELIEVE

13:58.585 --> 14:00.924
WE'RE TRUSTING A GUY
WHO TALKS TO RATS.

14:00.925 --> 14:03.097
OH, YOU MEAN
LIKE WE DO WITH
MASTER SPLINTER?

14:03.098 --> 14:06.372
AND THERE IS
YOUR MISS O'NEILL,

14:06.373 --> 14:08.212
JUST AS PROMISED.

14:08.213 --> 14:11.454
OH, WOW!
AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

14:11.455 --> 14:13.126
APRIL,
ARE YOU OK?

14:13.127 --> 14:15.465
I'LL BE FINE
NOW THAT YOU FELLAS
ARE HERE.

14:15.466 --> 14:16.970
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

14:16.971 --> 14:18.574
THE RAT KING
HELPED US.

14:18.575 --> 14:20.947
YOUR HIGHNESS,
I GUESS WE OWE YOU--

14:20.948 --> 14:22.318
HE'S GONE!

14:22.319 --> 14:23.990
SPLIT CITY!

14:23.991 --> 14:26.329
I WONDER WHERE
HE COULD HAVE GONE.

14:26.330 --> 14:27.834
ALAS, TURTLES,

14:27.835 --> 14:30.175
I FEAR YOU WILL
NEVER LEARN THAT.

14:30.176 --> 14:31.746
SHREDDER!

14:31.747 --> 14:34.687
OH, SWELL.
WE'VE TRADED ONE RAT
FOR ANOTHER.

14:34.688 --> 14:36.960
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO GRABBED ME.

14:36.961 --> 14:41.540
NO, MY DEAR.
IT WAS I,
BAXTER THE FLY.

14:41.541 --> 14:43.846
BAXTER!
THE FLY!

14:43.847 --> 14:46.989
THESE OLD SUBWAY
STATIONS ALWAYS HAVE
SUCH A GREAT ECHO.

14:46.990 --> 14:50.666
YES, AND NOW THAT
I HAVE YOU TURTLES
IN MY STICKY GRASP,

14:50.667 --> 14:52.672
REVENGE IS MINE!

14:56.083 --> 14:58.923
BLAST THEM WITH
THE FREEZE GUNS!

14:58.924 --> 15:00.461
Rocksteady:
RIGHT, BOSS.

15:00.462 --> 15:02.467
NO, NO!
THEY'RE MINE!

15:06.412 --> 15:08.585
AAH! IT'S GAS!

15:11.694 --> 15:15.538
OH, WHAT NOXIOUS VAPOR
IS THAT, BAXTER?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.711
A DEADLY CONCOCTION
I INJECTED

15:17.712 --> 15:19.048
INTO THE GAS LINE.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.622
WE'D BETTER GET AWAY
BEFORE IT AFFECTS
US, TOO!

15:21.623 --> 15:25.633
IN A FEW MINUTES,
THE TURTLES
WILL BE NO MORE!

15:30.982 --> 15:33.589
THERE, SHREDDER.
I'VE KEPT MY END
OF THE BARGAIN.

15:33.590 --> 15:34.759
NOW, IT'S YOUR TURN.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.431
I PROMISE
I'LL HAVE YOU

15:36.432 --> 15:39.139
HUMAN AGAIN
IN NO TIME, BAXTER.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.479
OR AS CLOSE TO IT
AS YOU WERE BEFORE.

15:43.017 --> 15:46.025
GOT TO STOP
THAT GAS.

15:53.347 --> 15:55.552
APRIL, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

15:55.553 --> 15:57.090
I'M OK.

15:57.091 --> 16:00.734
BUT THAT FLY CHARACTER
DOESN'T LIKE YOU BOYS
VERY MUCH, DOES HE?

16:00.735 --> 16:03.408
TRUST ME,
THE FEELING
IS MUTUAL.

16:03.409 --> 16:04.678
LET'S GO GET HIM.

16:04.679 --> 16:06.851
APRIL,
YOU'D BETTER
STAY HERE.

16:06.852 --> 16:08.757
IT COULD BE
DANGEROUS.

16:08.758 --> 16:10.195
I KNEW
HE'D SAY THAT.

16:10.196 --> 16:12.936
STAY HERE,
AND MISS THE STORY
OF THE CENTURY?

16:12.937 --> 16:15.810
NO WAY!
I'M COMING
WITH YOU.

16:15.811 --> 16:17.482
I KNEW
SHE'D SAY THAT!

16:18.486 --> 16:20.022
WHAT'S TAKING
SO LONG?

16:20.023 --> 16:21.360
NOTHING.

16:21.361 --> 16:23.867
WE'RE READY TO RETURN
TO THE TECHNODROME.

16:23.868 --> 16:26.207
AND THEN,
I'LL BE TURNED BACK
INTO A HUMAN, RIGHT?

16:26.208 --> 16:28.145
OF COURSE, BAXTER.

16:28.146 --> 16:30.486
HAVE I EVER BROKEN
MY WORD BEFORE?

16:30.487 --> 16:31.689
SURE, BOSS.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.361
REMEMBER
THE TIME YOU--

16:34.498 --> 16:36.938
SHUT UP.
I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

16:36.939 --> 16:38.910
OOH, HURRY UP,
WILL YOU?

16:38.911 --> 16:42.587
I CAN'T HOLD THIS
MUCH LONGER, PAL.

16:42.588 --> 16:45.997
ALL RIGHT,
GOOD BUDDY.

16:47.168 --> 16:49.675
YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT,
HOG BREATH!

16:49.676 --> 16:52.349
REMEMBER TO
CONTROL YOURSELF.

16:52.350 --> 16:55.490
RIGHT NOW,
I'M CONTROLLING
THIS 2x4,

16:55.491 --> 16:56.661
AND I'M GOING
TO WRAP IT

16:56.662 --> 16:59.436
AROUND YOUR UGLY
PAL HEAD!

17:01.308 --> 17:02.979
STOP IT, YOU FOOLS!

17:02.980 --> 17:05.085
YOU'LL DAMAGE
THE MODULE.

17:05.086 --> 17:06.321
HE STARTED IT.

17:06.323 --> 17:08.862
I DID NOT,
HE DID.

17:08.863 --> 17:11.771
NEVER MIND.
JUST FIX
THAT VALVE RIG.

17:11.771 --> 17:13.108
I'LL DEAL
WITH YOU TWO

17:13.108 --> 17:14.880
WHEN WE GET BACK
TO THE TECHNODROME.

17:14.881 --> 17:17.453
Leonardo: HOLD IT
RIGHT THERE, SHREDDER!

17:17.454 --> 17:19.727
YOUR FLIGHT HAS
BEEN CANCELED.

17:19.728 --> 17:23.906
THE TURTLES!
WHAT DOES IT TAKE
TO STOP YOU?

17:23.906 --> 17:26.646
WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU AIN'T GOT IT.

17:26.647 --> 17:28.987
WE'LL DISCUSS IT
SOME OTHER TIME.

17:32.765 --> 17:35.272
Donatello:
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

17:35.273 --> 17:37.913
GEE, WHAT
A SMOOTH GETAWAY.

17:41.791 --> 17:44.364
SOMETHING'S
GONE HAYWIRE.

17:44.365 --> 17:45.701
I KNEW IT!

17:45.702 --> 17:48.643
YOU DAMAGED
THE GUIDING SENSORS
WHEN YOU WERE FIGHTING.

17:48.644 --> 17:52.354
WELL, AT LEAST
WE CAN SHUT DOWN
THIS WATER DRAIN.

17:53.993 --> 17:55.362
April: LOOK OUT!

17:55.363 --> 17:57.401
NOW, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERYDAY--

17:57.402 --> 17:58.873
A RUNAWAY MODULE.

18:04.222 --> 18:07.196
Raphael:
IT'S TURNING THE PLACE
INTO SWISS CHEESE!

18:07.197 --> 18:10.105
BUMMER.
WHY COULDN'T IT
BE MOZZARELLA?

18:10.106 --> 18:12.612
THE WHOLE THING
IS GOING
TO COLLAPSE!

18:12.613 --> 18:14.184
I'LL STOP IT!

18:17.894 --> 18:19.899
WHOA, WAY TO GO, DUDE!

18:19.900 --> 18:22.473
RIDE 'EM, TURTLE BOY!

18:22.474 --> 18:25.816
IF I CAN JUST GET
TO A FUEL LINE...

18:27.255 --> 18:28.424
GOT IT!

18:31.300 --> 18:34.274
THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT,
PORK NOSE!

18:34.275 --> 18:36.247
OH, YEAH?
YOU WAS THE ONE

18:36.248 --> 18:38.085
WHO CLOBBERED
THAT SENSOR.

18:45.274 --> 18:47.211
Donatello:
WE CAN'T SHUT OFF
THE VALVE!

18:47.212 --> 18:50.487
DO SOMETHING,
SHREDDER!

18:50.488 --> 18:52.526
BAXTER,
WILL YOU BUZZ OFF?

18:52.527 --> 18:53.764
BETTER YET,

18:53.765 --> 18:55.568
YOU'LL MAKE
A WONDERFUL SPECIMEN

18:55.569 --> 18:57.875
FOR A HIGH SCHOOL
SCIENCE PROJECT.

18:57.876 --> 18:59.881
LOOK!
THE FREEZE RAY!

18:59.882 --> 19:02.220
IT'S TURNING ALL
THE WATER INTO ICE.

19:05.732 --> 19:07.837
HA HA. I GOT
A CRAZY IDEA.

19:07.838 --> 19:09.174
LET'S GET OUT
OF HERE!

19:09.175 --> 19:11.481
THE RESERVOIR'S
GOING TO BLOW!

19:11.482 --> 19:12.851
OH, NO!

19:12.852 --> 19:14.857
<i>AU REVOIR,
RESERVOIR.</i>

19:17.366 --> 19:19.136
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:19.137 --> 19:21.542
THE ENTIRE PLACE
IS COMING DOWN!

19:21.543 --> 19:23.348
RUN, YOU MUTANT MORONS!

19:36.954 --> 19:40.196
HEY,
WHO INVITED HIM?

19:40.197 --> 19:41.500
AIN'T YOU HEARD?

19:41.501 --> 19:43.940
THERE'S FLIES
AT EVERY PICNIC!

19:47.385 --> 19:48.855
WHAT'S THAT?

19:48.856 --> 19:51.863
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A TRANSPORT MODULE.

19:57.949 --> 20:02.761
GEE, I ALWAYS WANTED
ONE OF THEM AUTOMATIC
ICE MAKERS.

20:02.762 --> 20:06.539
PERSONALLY,
I LIKE THE KIND
YOU CAN SHUT OFF.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.815
WELL, SHREDDER,
THERE'S ANOTHER
SCHEME OF YOURS

20:09.816 --> 20:11.686
DOWN THE TUBES.

20:11.687 --> 20:14.327
IT'S NOT
A TOTAL LOSS, KRANG.

20:14.328 --> 20:16.500
LOOK WHO I BROUGHT
TO WORK FOR US--

20:16.501 --> 20:20.378
THE MOST BRILLIANT
SCIENTIFIC MIND
SINCE EINSTEIN.

20:20.379 --> 20:24.022
WITH HIM ON OUR SIDE,
THE WORLD IS OUR OYSTER.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.393
HMM.

20:25.394 --> 20:29.003
I PREFER MY SEAFOOD
WITHOUT FLIES.

20:30.006 --> 20:32.313
OK, THAT'S
THE FINAL INSULT!

20:32.314 --> 20:36.625
YOU'LL TWO WILL BE SORRY
YOU EVER STARTED UP
WITH BAXTER STOCKMAN!

20:40.838 --> 20:43.411
MY, MY.
QUITE AN EXIT.

20:43.412 --> 20:45.818
I'VE A FEELING
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST

20:45.819 --> 20:49.695
OF THAT BRILLIANT
BUT BOTHERSOME
HALF-MAN, HALF-INSECT.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.704
AND SO,
THE RESERVOIR
WAS SAVED?

20:52.705 --> 20:54.209
<i>THAT'S RIGHT,
SENSEI.</i>

20:54.210 --> 20:56.883
IT DIDN'T LOSE MORE
THAN A FEW THOUSAND
GALLONS.

20:56.884 --> 20:59.123
AND, AS GOOD CITIZENS,
WE'VE EVEN FIXED

20:59.124 --> 21:00.794
A FEW DRIPS
WHILE WE WERE THERE.

21:04.406 --> 21:06.276
WHAT'S WRONG,
MICHELANGELO?

21:06.277 --> 21:10.723
OH, MY TENDER BOD
IS SEVERELY BRUISED
FROM THAT BATTLE.

21:10.724 --> 21:14.567
APPLYING COLD
TO AN INJURY IS
A CENTURIES-OLD CURE.

21:14.568 --> 21:17.743
HEY, FANTABULOSO IDEA,
MASTER.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.916
I'LL JUST SLAP
A COLD SLICE OF PIZZA

21:22.256 --> 21:25.164
OH, NO,
NOT MORE ICE!

21:29.845 --> 21:31.448
THAT ICE
REALLY WORKS.

21:31.449 --> 21:33.922
YEAH. A MINUTE AGO,
HE COULD BARELY MOVE,

21:33.923 --> 21:35.928
AND NOW HE'S DANCING.
