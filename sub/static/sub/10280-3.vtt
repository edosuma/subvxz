WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:07.541
Previously on E.R.:

00:07.575 --> 00:09.343
I've been here for
sixteen hours.

00:09.377 --> 00:13.081
I have been ignored
and yelled at

00:13.114 --> 00:15.216
and called honey
and sweetie and bitch.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.285
And all I've had to eat is
gummy bears and diet coke.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.087
I'm not leaving until
I get what I came for.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.188
Those are my friends G.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.289
Yeah, well this is my house.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.691
Mine too.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.227
Oh, what you pay rent?
C'mon watch out man.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.529
No does that mean I can't
have no friends?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.332
MAN:
How, how you doin'?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.101
How you doin', how you doin'?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.602
( metal rattling in jar )
How, how you...?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.537
How you doin', how you doin'?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.406
How, how you doin'?
How you doin', how you doin'?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.241
WEAVER:
Hey!
Oh, how you doin'?

00:40.274 --> 00:42.610
Hey, why is there a rule-out MI
parked in the elevator lobby?

00:42.643 --> 00:43.811
Because there's
no beds.

00:43.844 --> 00:44.745
Well, Two's open.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.347
Two was open.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.781
Lithobid 300 in Five,
50 of Benadryl in Six.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.783
Susan, I know that the
system is overwhelmed...

00:49.817 --> 00:52.286
The system?
...but you know, you've
got to manage it better.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.721
Kerry, I swear to you,
I am about

00:53.754 --> 00:56.457
to lose it so
unless you want
to take over...

00:56.490 --> 00:58.126
Move all noncriticals
off of monitored beds

00:58.159 --> 01:00.194
and into the hallway
and treat and street triage.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.129
Have you seen
the hallways?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.396
How you doin'?!

01:02.430 --> 01:03.564
Does he have
to be here?

01:03.597 --> 01:04.732
Dr. Kovac says
he can go

01:04.765 --> 01:06.234
as soon as his
banana bag's done.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.868
Then do it
outside.
Are you serious?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.437
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

01:09.470 --> 01:10.871
Room 1847, please.
Gallant

01:10.904 --> 01:12.140
is this guy yours?

01:12.173 --> 01:13.474
Yeah, yeah.
Mr. Fierson?

01:13.507 --> 01:15.143
Come on.
Get out of my way.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.510
Eric Wyczenski.
Okay

01:16.544 --> 01:17.845
I'll lean on Mercy

01:17.878 --> 01:20.248
and see if they can accept
some of the overflow.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.150
Break some legs
if you have to.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.152
Hey, it's Abby.
Um, I'm totally swamped here.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.653
I'm not going to be able
to make lunch

01:25.686 --> 01:27.788
but, uh, page me
and we'll reschedule for dinner.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.856
CARTER:
Frank, call security.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.558
You have to let me go.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.493
Your patient?
I'm not supposed
to be here.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.428
Yeah.
What's he doing
with the box?

01:34.462 --> 01:36.497
You'll kill me!
You'll kill me!

01:36.530 --> 01:38.399
Mr. Barney,
we don't want
to kill you.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.767
We want to help you.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.471
I take it you
called security.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.406
( thumping, grunting )

01:45.439 --> 01:46.640
Probably out ticketing
our cars.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.309
Are those the same guys

01:48.342 --> 01:50.611
that plant those
orange stickers
on our bumpers?

01:50.644 --> 01:51.912
Oh, yeah,
they're multitalented.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.181
They're impossible
to get off.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.315
Try Goo Gone.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.650
Goo, Goo, Goo, Goo Off
from Pep Boys.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.618
Really, that works?

01:57.651 --> 01:59.287
Yeah,
it comes right off.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.789
Do you know how
to get blood out
of white suede?

02:01.822 --> 02:03.924
Try white vinegar
and club soda.
Really?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.494
Hey, how you doin'?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.762
Groovy.
How you doin'?

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.847 --> 03:00.981
PRATT ( chuckling ):
Damn.

03:01.014 --> 03:01.849
Ay-ay-ay.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.351
Hey, check this out.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.918
Foreign body.
Ten inches.
Uh-huh.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.354
Extra-large vibrator,
still on.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.821
One day, I'm going
to show you

03:07.855 --> 03:08.922
my bowling pin X ray.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.324
Little guy,
but very flexible.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.492
( chuckles )
Ten out of ten.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.760
My pain
is ten out of ten.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.428
Mr. Mullen, today
is not a good day.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.429
I know,
I got a slipped disc.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.730
I need a pain shot.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.898
But you don't care.
I just saw him

03:17.931 --> 03:19.467
bending over
the water fountain.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.834
I seen the guy in here
15 times

03:20.868 --> 03:22.470
in the last two months
asking for Demerol.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.937
LEWIS:
We're doctors, okay?

03:23.971 --> 03:25.873
That's it.
We shouldn't have to take down

03:25.906 --> 03:27.541
a needle-throwing psychotic.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.443
We can't be everywhere
at all times.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.611
Simple law of physics.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.280
We need you here
when we call. Period.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.282
We've been through this
over and over again.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.683
Why can't we hire
a new company?

03:35.716 --> 03:36.650
Hey, I'm
understaffed.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.918
MVA rolling up.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.787
I got turnover
up the wazoo.
Carter?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.755
Ten bucks an hour
is not going to keep

03:41.789 --> 03:42.790
any half decent guys here.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.757
What's open?

03:43.791 --> 03:44.858
You're kidding, right?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.594
Harkins, Gown up.
You're with me.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.828
I am in agony here.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.297
Turf this guy
to the pain clinic.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.864
Nah, I'm waiting
for him to lebs.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.300
Lebs?
Leave without being seen.
Lebs.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.634
Near-miss auto
versus pedestrian.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.735
GCS 14, no LOC.

03:54.768 --> 03:55.969
BP and pulse stable
within normal.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.638
I am not leaving!
Give me my shot!

03:57.671 --> 03:58.672
Can you tell me
your name?

03:58.706 --> 03:59.740
Anonymous.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.975
Hey, Morales,
move your patient.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.377
I'm waiting for a bed.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.445
Muevete, amigo.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.614
Right. ( mumbles in Spanish )

04:06.647 --> 04:08.349
Have you been drinking,
Anonymous?

04:08.382 --> 04:09.583
I thought he was nice.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.918
He paid me extra.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.487
Then he tried to run me
over with his Mercedes.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.456
Oh, God.
Did you call the police?

04:15.489 --> 04:17.757
Yeah, I got them on speed dial.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.992
We got swelling
to the right

04:19.026 --> 04:20.827
lateral malleolus.
We got abrasions

04:20.861 --> 04:22.530
to the left forearm.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.031
Uh, Dr. Carter,
I think she's posturing.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.500
No, she's greedy.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.868
Okay, um...
can you let go?

04:27.901 --> 04:29.670
I worked hard for that.
Hey.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.871
She'll put it in a safe place.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.507
Does this hurt?

04:33.541 --> 04:34.908
( inhales sharply ):
Lower, lower.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.976
Right in here?

04:36.009 --> 04:37.478
Yeah.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.480
Bilateral lower quadrant
tenderness. What next?

04:39.513 --> 04:41.882
Ask if she sees a gynecologist.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.851
Do you see
a gynecologist?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.720
Yeah. Every Sunday
after confession.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.589
ABBY:
One, two, three.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.890
How did he fall
out of bed?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.392
He can barely move.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.594
They'd just gave him
a bath or something.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
Are you in pain,
Mr. Berk?

04:54.828 --> 04:55.996
Forget it.
He's gorked out.

04:56.029 --> 04:56.997
What nursing home?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.031
Garden Sunrise
in Schaumburg.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.700
Sunset is more like it.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.802
Yeah. I wouldn't send
my mom to that dump.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.970
And I hate my mom.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.372
LEWIS:
This the hip fracture?

05:04.372 --> 05:06.106
Yeah, hard to
get a baseline.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.074
End stage Huntington's.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.476
Luka is screaming
for you.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.943
Says he's been waiting
for 45 minutes

05:09.977 --> 05:11.545
for a lighted speculum.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.648
Well, I'm an hour
and 45 minutes behind.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.385
Great. Piss him off some more.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.919
Protecting his airway.
( man moaning )

05:18.952 --> 05:20.721
That's a clue.
What do we know, Gallant?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.890
GALLANT:
Huntington's hits you
in your 30s and 40s.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.425
Start with emotional
lability

05:24.458 --> 05:25.593
and depression.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.860
Leads to a
progressive loss

05:26.894 --> 05:28.596
of motor control and
cognitive function.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.797
Death in ten
to 20 years.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.864
He's been
diagnosed for 15.

05:30.898 --> 05:31.865
Let's roll him.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.467
What's he pissed about?

05:33.501 --> 05:35.068
Well, hurt.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.604
About what?

05:36.637 --> 05:37.571
Abby.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.940
Oh, no, he doesn't care.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.041
Ew.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.776
Nasty pressure sore.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.945
10x18 centimeter decubitus.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.114
Have you talked to him
about it?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.449
Why?

05:48.482 --> 05:49.917
I don't have to. He's fine.

05:49.950 --> 05:50.984
Ooh.
Is that sacrum?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.586
All the way down
to the bone.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.588
You know, we got this.
At least get him his speculum.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.856
B.P.'s 80.
He needs fluids.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.626
Hey, Abby, I need a
frog-leg finger splint.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.993
Try central.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.696
Abby?
Yeah?

06:02.730 --> 06:03.831
I need a detox bed

06:03.864 --> 06:05.633
for the child prostitute
in the hall.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.635
Oh, yeah, they're
as jammed as we are.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.702
She's 12 years old.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.937
Cocaine, probably crack.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.639
Okay, I'll see
what I can do.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.940
PID?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.542
Tubo-ovarian abscess.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.643
Ooh, lovely.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.144
Hey, how does
Original Thai sound?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.846
Tonight, we take
your brother out.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.615
I get to hear
some embarrassing
childhood stories.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.016
He's allergic to MSG.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.585
That's unfortunate.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.019
HARKIN ( grunting ):
I really think

06:26.053 --> 06:27.020
we should
switch places.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.590
Come on.
Keep it coming.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.591
Kovac's pelvic exam?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.025
Curtain Three.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.961
You push enough Valium?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.796
Any more and he'd
be unconscious.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.898
Ow...!
Damn.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.467
CARTER:
We'll let him pick the place.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.468
He doesn't know any places.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.835
First time in Chicago?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.737
Usually, we have to meet
up in a strange city

06:43.771 --> 06:45.773
in front of some
psychiatric institution.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.008
You said your mom
sounded fine.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.577
She is. She does.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.978
She's fine.
Okay.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.079
How about Morton's?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.947
He's not a vegetarian,
is he?

06:53.981 --> 06:55.849
No. Beef's good.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.917
You started.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.218
Finished.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.653
Didn't know when
you'd get here.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.021
Did you say
you're done?
Yeah.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.090
You can put your legs
down, Mrs. Lundgren.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.625
Effie, please.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.026
Lundgren's my husband's name.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.797
Mrs. Lundgren tried to
vacuum out her period.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.931
Menstrual extraction.

07:10.964 --> 07:11.899
Very common practice.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.567
Practice for what?

07:13.601 --> 07:15.803
The day when the men
who run the world

07:15.836 --> 07:17.771
take away your freedom
of choice.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.573
Until then,
you could perforate your uterus

07:19.607 --> 07:21.041
end up infertile
or bleed to death.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.944
If men needed abortions,
there'd be drive-thrus

07:23.977 --> 07:26.213
with beer on tap
and TVs tuned to ESPN.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.848
It's still no reason
to do this

07:27.881 --> 07:28.916
to your body.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
You got to wake up, honey.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.019
We're at war.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.654
Conscientious objector.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.788
( exhales )

07:34.822 --> 07:36.023
CBC

07:36.056 --> 07:39.693
type and screen,
Beta and a urine.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.963
Sorry.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.131
Yeah.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.203
So, are you taking
any oral contraceptives?

07:50.237 --> 07:53.907
Want to give me
a reason to?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.850
These are yours.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.851
Thanks.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.952
That's it?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.555
"Sorry" and "Thanks"?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.660
What do you want
from me, Kathy?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.928
Nothing.
I don't want anything.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.067
Uh, Icon, too?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.569
What?

08:21.602 --> 08:24.004
Menstrual extraction.
You want Icon, too?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.138
Uh, if you want.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.840
You okay?

08:26.874 --> 08:27.975
Yeah.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.978
No, that was just, uh...

08:31.011 --> 08:33.212
You know...
Yeah.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.149
But are you okay?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.918
Yeah.
Managing 14 patients

08:37.951 --> 08:40.688
a little too much grappa
last night.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.755
Other than that...

08:41.789 --> 08:42.823
Other than that.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.895
Hey, I'm-I'm happy for you,
Abby.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.137
A golf ball?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.072
The size
of a golf ball.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.075
Around your fallopian tube,
near your ovary.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.679
What do you do
to get rid of it?

09:05.713 --> 09:08.849
Antibiotics
might clear it up.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.152
If not,
laparoscopic surgery.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.254
It's sexually
transmitted.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.856
No, duh.
I ain't stupid.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.158
Well, then maybe
you can tell me your name.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.293
Your real name.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.963
Tina. Tina Jones.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.265
Well, Tina Jones,
I don't know

09:25.298 --> 09:27.300
what got you in here
at 12

09:27.334 --> 09:30.838
but if you want
to make it to 20

09:30.871 --> 09:33.306
you've got to stop
smoking crack.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.909
I can get you into
a detox bed today.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.045
Yeah, that'll fix everything.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.813
That'll fix
one thing.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.682
Then maybe you can get
started on the rest.

09:41.715 --> 09:42.950
Carter?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.718
Lewis want you to ship McPheny
to outpatient.

09:44.752 --> 09:45.853
Not now, Malik.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.054
When do I get
my money back?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.021
After detox.

09:48.055 --> 09:51.024
You can't do that.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.260
Sleeping with strangers
for money.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.862
That's what you want?

09:54.895 --> 09:56.997
I've got to take care
of myself.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.868
Well, I'm trying to give you
a chance to do that.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.037
You don't know what it...

10:04.071 --> 10:06.239
You don't know.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.345
I know it's not too late.

10:13.346 --> 10:17.050
School, friends...

10:17.084 --> 10:19.920
birthday parties.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.023
The things a girl your age
should be doing.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.958
You have a choice.
I'm giving it to you.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.727
CHUNY:
Carter?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.028
High-speed MVA coming in.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.997
MAN:
Excuse me.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.064
Excuse me.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.266
I will be right back.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.806
MAN:
Hey, do you...?

10:38.839 --> 10:39.973
Hey, Gallant.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.275
Why is Stella
on a monitored bed?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.912
Positive Homans'.
She could have DVT.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.346
Sorry,
quick question.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.015
Triage, down the hall,
to the left.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.883
Go get a venous doppler
and then street her.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.852
You are not
her personal physician.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.186
Hi, I'm looking
for Abby Lockhart.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.688
She's a nurse here.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.422
Are you Eric?
Yeah.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.057
Hey. John Carter.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.792
Sorry, things
are a little crazy
around here today.

10:58.826 --> 10:59.993
Yeah, the guy at
the desk told me

11:00.027 --> 11:01.361
that you were closed
and to go home.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.462
I was expecting
an Air Force uniform.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.897
Oh, well,
I'm undercover.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.332
Dr. Carter? Excuse me.
Um, what do I do

11:05.365 --> 11:07.334
if pathology refuses
to analyze a foreign body?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.036
You get a Polaroid
for the medical record.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.403
And how do I get
a camera?
Look for one.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.005
MULLEN:
Do I have to puke
on the floor to get

11:12.039 --> 11:13.040
some attention
around here?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.842
We have heart attacks,
strokes

11:14.875 --> 11:16.443
and bleeding ulcers
and they're all ahead
of you, okay?

11:16.476 --> 11:17.745
Abby?
What?

11:17.745 --> 11:18.812
I have been here
for four hours

11:18.846 --> 11:19.813
and you haven't done...
Hi.

11:19.847 --> 11:20.748
...a damn thing.
My God.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.015
What are you
doing here?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.350
I thought you were going
to feed me.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.484
I am in pain every single minute

11:24.517 --> 11:25.485
of every day.
Don't you

11:25.518 --> 11:26.486
check your messages?
Hey!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.121
I am talking to you.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.389
Pratt.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.024
No, not him.
He doesn't want to help me.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.359
Dr. Pratt is
only concerned

11:32.392 --> 11:34.027
that you're building
up a tolerance

11:34.061 --> 11:35.062
to the narcotics.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.363
Yeah, well, that's

11:36.396 --> 11:38.031
why I need more.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.099
Is it like this
every day?

11:39.132 --> 11:40.200
Who the hell are you?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.802
Eric.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.303
Well, yes, Eric,
I'm in pain every day

11:43.336 --> 11:45.372
and they don't want to do
anything to help me.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.139
You know, if I came in here

11:46.173 --> 11:47.407
in a suit and tie

11:47.440 --> 11:49.409
they'd give me my meds
in two minutes.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.912
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
now get out of here.
It's about time.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.380
Wait a minute.
Vicodin?

11:53.413 --> 11:54.882
Take it or leave it.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.316
One Vicodin's not
going to do it.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.818
Well, that's what
you're going to get.

11:57.851 --> 11:58.251
Go play Lakeshore.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.787
Hello?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.388
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Thanks very much.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.024
You know, you think you're a
bunch of heroes, or something?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.158
You know what, look around!

12:05.192 --> 12:06.359
You are not
doing anything!

12:06.393 --> 12:07.460
You're not helping

12:07.494 --> 12:08.962
anyone!

12:08.996 --> 12:10.864
( grunts )

12:10.898 --> 12:11.932
Hey!

12:11.965 --> 12:13.967
Get out of here.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.470
We like excitement.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.808
Did you hear
she got a dog?

12:20.808 --> 12:21.408
Yes. "Dumpy."

12:21.441 --> 12:22.943
Is that right?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.112
'Cause he was dumped
at the pound.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.281
Yeah, it turns out
he's got a vitamin deficiency.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.817
He needs a special diet

12:29.850 --> 12:31.551
so she cooks him bacon and eggs
in the morning.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.453
She never made me breakfast
in my life

12:33.486 --> 12:34.822
but she'll cook for the dog.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.957
No, no, she cooked for you.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.427
Well, she can cook for the zoo
as long as she's happy.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.430
I mean, she's good, even.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.965
I think maybe this time...

12:44.998 --> 12:47.400
Maybe.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.169
Thanks.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.940
I'm sorry I wasn't there
the last few times.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.942
It's okay.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.443
No guilt.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.111
It's not our fault, remember?

12:58.145 --> 12:59.512
( door opens )

12:59.546 --> 13:00.981
Hey, Abby, where's the baggie
of fingertips?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.449
Uh, in Exam Two.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.884
The cops brought them in
before the run got here.

13:03.917 --> 13:04.852
It ain't there.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.286
Chen's freaking out.

13:07.554 --> 13:08.521
Baggie of fingertips?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.290
Yes.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.125
Two neighbors tried
to trim their hedge

13:12.159 --> 13:13.861
by hoisting a lawnmower
in the air.

13:13.861 --> 13:14.427
Thank you.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.195
Teamwork.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.964
You know what?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.866
I don't think I'm going
to be able to get a break

13:18.899 --> 13:20.000
so maybe we should meet
at your hotel at 6:00.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.001
Adele Newman
for you on two.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.135
Uh, can you take a message?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.937
Or 7:00 actually
would be better

13:23.971 --> 13:25.605
and then we can
go out to dinner,
show you the city.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.107
Well, I can't

13:27.140 --> 13:28.341
'cause I got to get
an 8:15 bus to Offut.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.509
Offut?
What's Offut?

13:29.542 --> 13:31.544
Offut Air Force Base,
my new station.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.280
Abby, I need a transfusion
set up in Five.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.948
Okay, in a minute.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.583
Uh, it's a menstrual
extraction victim.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.885
I thought
you cleared her.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.886
A different one.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.552
Some kind
of party.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.921
One hell of a party.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.055
You're getting
transferred?

13:42.089 --> 13:43.123
Um, reassigned.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.391
I got to report
in the morning.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.358
Again?

13:45.392 --> 13:46.526
Yeah, it's the Air Force.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.161
C-Can you hold this
for a second?

13:48.195 --> 13:49.529
GALLANT:
Okay, blow out
all your air.

13:49.562 --> 13:50.630
( exhales )

13:50.663 --> 13:51.631
Now breathe in.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.900
Oh! Right there, honey.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.467
Yeah, yeah.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.269
Abby, can you order
a right upper quadrant
ultrasound for me?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.005
Yeah, in a minute.
Have you seen
a bag of...?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.472
It's in a bucket of ice
by the X rays.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.507
Thank you.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.508
Mm-hmm.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.542
Don't ask.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.643
When did this happen?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.045
Last week.
Got to read your e-mail.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.213
Well, how come
it's so soon?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.580
I'm sorry.
That's top secret.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.982
( men arguing )
Okay, I got 'em.

14:09.016 --> 14:09.983
What happened?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.251
Uh, got here
before they did.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.552
They're all
in one bag?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.387
Guess they didn't sort them
at the scene.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.655
Well, we need to
sort them now.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.656
Okay, one minute.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.126
Where is this?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.127
Nebraska.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.594
MAN:
Hey, hey!

14:21.628 --> 14:23.630
Is she going to get
her clothes back?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.532
They're in a bag
under the bed.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.534
I heard it's
kind of pretty.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.070
It's closer to you,
it's closer to Mom.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.471
Abby, LOL in Four
has diarrhea.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.340
Oh, good. You said
you needed a stool sample.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.008
You could scrape
it off the floor.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.177
Mm. Starting to appreciate
why you dissed me.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.178
I'm sorry.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.113
You actually like this?

14:40.147 --> 14:43.050
Yeah. It's not that different
from air traffic controlling.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.551
Without the menstrual
extractions.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.953
MAN:
Hey!

14:45.986 --> 14:47.287
Where her shoes at?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.522
Yeah, in a minute.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.291
You go do what
you got to do.
I'll wait for you.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.592
Okay, I'll be right back.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.361
Hey, Frank, take care
of my baby brother.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.428
Is he potty-trained?

14:55.462 --> 14:57.064
CHUNY:
Turned him off

14:57.097 --> 14:58.565
his decube, and
he bottomed out.

14:58.598 --> 14:59.699
70 systolic.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.001
But he is so pale.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.335
Is it a hematoma?

15:02.369 --> 15:03.503
Are you his nurse?

15:03.536 --> 15:04.537
No, I'm his mother.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.605
16 in the left AC.

15:05.638 --> 15:06.974
He's still got good veins.

15:06.974 --> 15:07.707
Get some O-neg
from trauma

15:07.740 --> 15:08.708
type and cross four more.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.577
Phillip...

15:10.610 --> 15:12.145
I'm sorry.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.713
I... it was

15:13.746 --> 15:16.183
the best home
that I c...

15:16.216 --> 15:17.184
I could get.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.418
I don't have much, and...

15:18.451 --> 15:20.120
Nothing definite
on the ultrasound.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.088
Get me a triple
lumen kit.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.990
Pressure's up to 86.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.992
He's-he's in pain.
Can't you give him something?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.459
He's had 200 fentanyl.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.661
It could be the cause
of his breathing problem.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.463
But he's suffering.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.666
Can't... can't you see
how much he's suffering?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.035
Please!

15:35.068 --> 15:37.037
( monitor flatlining )

15:37.070 --> 15:38.538
Morales.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.472
Morales!

15:39.506 --> 15:40.273
Hmm, what?

15:40.307 --> 15:41.708
What are you doing?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.643
( monitor beeping )
Loose connection.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.013
Can I get a bed now?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.581
This would go
a lot faster

15:48.615 --> 15:50.617
if these guys identified
their own fingers.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.751
What if we made a mistake?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.020
You think this
is a pinkie

15:53.020 --> 15:54.121
or a ring?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.422
Looks like a cocktail wienie.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.489
Ah...

15:56.523 --> 15:57.690
I got Morales' TIA in Four.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.026
Oh. Yeah, put
her on a 12 lead.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.027
I'll be right there.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.061
Have you guys seen my brother?

16:01.094 --> 16:02.462
What's he look like?

16:02.495 --> 16:03.730
He's about six feet,
he has brown hair

16:03.763 --> 16:05.198
looks like me might be
my brother.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.333
Mmm, yeah,
he's cute.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.567
I think he went
to get some coffee.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.735
Oh, yeah. The place
was tripping him out.

16:08.768 --> 16:09.769
Yeah, I wonder why.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.571
Pratt, you have three thumbs.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.107
What?
Unless one of
your patients
is a circus freak.

16:14.141 --> 16:15.775
Look, if you think
you can do a better job...

16:15.808 --> 16:16.709
Just did.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.710
Then be my guest.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.511
What's this?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.247
Match game.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.748
Pratt's having a little trouble
"fingering" it out.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.650
Oh...

16:23.683 --> 16:25.352
Come on. That's funny.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.054
So you got my detox bed?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.421
Uh, shoot.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.556
I have to call
Adele back.
I'm sorry.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.790
You didn't admit her?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.359
No. They're clearing
a space.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.293
Then where is she?

16:33.326 --> 16:36.663
Who?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.065
Frank, did somebody move

16:38.065 --> 16:38.631
the navicular
fracture in Two?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.100
I think she eloped.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.734
Why didn't you come
and get me?

16:41.768 --> 16:42.802
She didn't say anything.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.637
She just took off
with some guy.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.206
( clicks tongue )

16:46.239 --> 16:47.774
He asked me
for her clothes.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.076
What?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.577
He asked me
for her clothes.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.644
I didn't know
who she was.
I'm sorry.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.812
I asked you
to get her a bed.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.381
I was trying to
get her a bed.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.615
FRANK:
You think he was her pimp
or something?

16:55.648 --> 16:57.784
Her pimp, her dealer,
her boyfriend.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.719
Damn it.
I had her talked into it.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.154
Well, who let
the guy back there?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.622
The hell
if I know.
Dr. Carter.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.756
The whole world
can waltz right
through here.

17:03.790 --> 17:04.790
Dr. Carter!

17:04.824 --> 17:05.791
What?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.732
No, no, no, no, no.
Nobody move.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.401
GALLANT:
All right, it's cool.
Nobody move.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.568
It's cool.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.669
It is not.
It's not cool.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.806
I am in pain.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.775
I need Demerol, and you're going
to give it to me.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.611
Yes, I am.
I am going to... Abby?

17:24.644 --> 17:27.414
Go to Drug Lock-Up,
get a case of Demerol...

17:27.446 --> 17:28.548
I don't need a case.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.716
I just n...
I just need my shot.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.218
150 milligrams.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.320
GALLANT:
Okay. 150 milligrams then.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.155
See? There's no problem.
It's all right.

17:35.188 --> 17:35.855
Look, no problem.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.524
No, we got a problem!

17:37.557 --> 17:39.626
This here's supposed
to be a county hospital.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.827
( whispering ):
Call the police.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.795
What?
Call the police.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.697
You're supposed to
care about people,
but you don't!

17:44.731 --> 17:45.732
You don't care!

17:45.765 --> 17:46.599
I care now.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.834
( chuckles )

17:47.867 --> 17:49.736
Yeah. That's right. You do.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.871
What's taking so long in there?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.740
I'm coming.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.442
You care 'cause
I'm making you care

17:55.475 --> 17:56.376
'cause I got this gun.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.244
Because I'm the one

17:57.277 --> 17:58.345
who gets to decide.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.746
You don't have
to decide...

17:59.779 --> 18:01.514
No, I get to decide
who's going to feel pain

18:01.548 --> 18:02.849
and who's not going
to feel pain.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.384
Just like you.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.219
Every day.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.188
Show it to me.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.157
Show me it.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.358
Show me the label.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.164
Abby.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.199
Stay right there, Eric.

18:19.232 --> 18:19.866
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.534
Hurry up. Hurry up.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.802
We're going to help you,
give you the shot.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.571
Why don't you put
the gun down?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.173
I'll hold onto it
if it's just the same with you.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.274
Okay, where do you want it?

18:45.292 --> 18:46.759
Why'd you want to be a doctor?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.861
Excuse me?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.863
A doctor.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.433
Was it the money?

18:53.466 --> 18:54.801
That's part of it.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.437
And what's
the other part?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.705
It's complicated.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.441
Well, explain it to me.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.211
I mean, you can't tell me
that you actually wanted

19:04.211 --> 19:06.379
to help people.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.748
Or maybe you did, right?

19:08.781 --> 19:11.251
Maybe...

19:11.284 --> 19:13.286
maybe you all wanted
to help people

19:13.320 --> 19:14.754
but then
little by little

19:14.787 --> 19:16.423
you realized
that there's

19:16.456 --> 19:18.225
just too many
people to help.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.592
( moans softly )

19:19.626 --> 19:21.528
Who's going to survive?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.235
Thank you.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.645
Hey, remember this...

19:42.315 --> 19:44.817
...for next time.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.910
( panting )

20:18.285 --> 20:19.018
How much did you give him?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.453
400.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.888
That'll do it.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.590
( sirens blaring )

20:25.358 --> 20:26.493
Is he breathing?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.027
What do
you care?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.629
I don't, but why don't
you get some narcaine

20:29.662 --> 20:31.364
off the rig.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.965
WEAVER:
We'll need to monitor
his breathing.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.034
Pratt, get a gurney.
Four-point restraint.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.869
Put him on a pulse ox
and call psych.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.338
You should go inside
and lie down.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.272
I'm fine.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.307
You should go lie down.

20:40.340 --> 20:40.940
I don't need to lie down.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.475
Where you going?

20:42.509 --> 20:44.344
Hey, whatever happened
to those metal detectors?

20:44.377 --> 20:46.413
Not now, John.
Where's Chen?

20:46.446 --> 20:48.348
We were supposed to have
those a year ago.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.283
It's all part
of the security plan.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.918
What security plan?

20:53.953 --> 20:55.422
So you like it
here then?

20:55.455 --> 20:56.756
Yeah.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.025
Keeps the days from blurring
together, you know.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.960
What are you doing, Abby?

21:00.993 --> 21:03.463
You came on
the wrong day.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.332
From what I can tell
you're smarter than

21:05.332 --> 21:06.899
most of the people
here-- smart enough

21:06.933 --> 21:08.535
to know you shouldn't
be working here.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.603
Well, that career advice
is just a little bit late

21:10.637 --> 21:12.339
but thank you.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.341
You don't find it even
a little self-destructive?

21:14.374 --> 21:16.343
No, no.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.812
And, honest, I think I'm happier
than I've been in a long time.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.649
Besides the gun in my face,
you know.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.884
What happened to med school?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.085
Uh...

21:26.118 --> 21:28.355
I have to go back to work.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.589
I'm sorry, but, um, uh...

21:29.622 --> 21:31.858
call me and
give me your numbers.

21:31.891 --> 21:32.992
I got three more hours.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.694
I know, but
I'm already juggling

21:34.727 --> 21:36.396
like, ten patients
and there's more stacking up

21:36.429 --> 21:37.630
and I know I'm not going to have

21:37.664 --> 21:39.866
any time, so call me
and have a great trip.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.868
Okay?

21:41.901 --> 21:43.503
WEAVER:
John, read the newspapers.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.505
County healthcare
expenditures are down

21:45.538 --> 21:46.939
over 30%...

21:46.973 --> 21:48.741
I don't have to read
the newspapers. I'm here.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.543
And security is not
a place to save money.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.011
Yeah, we're wasting it
on patient care.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.613
Oh, come on, Kerry

21:53.646 --> 21:55.114
you know these aren't
the same budget cutbacks.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.517
We were supposed to have the
metal detectors two years ago.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.785
It's not just
the metal detectors.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.119
Well, I think
it's a start.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.021
If you put them up,
you've got to man them.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.556
Oh, that's a crazy idea.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.991
I'll talk to the medical
executive committee.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.393
PRATT:
Hey, where do you
want him?

22:06.426 --> 22:07.794
Take him straight to the unit.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.828
Now. We need it now.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.062
We need a secured
triage area

22:10.096 --> 22:12.131
we need more guards,
we need better guards.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.833
You just work on
clearing the board...

22:13.866 --> 22:15.868
I cannot clear
that board!

22:15.902 --> 22:18.671
I am treating a 12-year-old girl
on the street, cracked up

22:18.705 --> 22:20.873
PID, tubo-ovarian abscess,
run over by a car

22:20.907 --> 22:23.410
and I've got two minutes
to spend with her because...

22:23.410 --> 22:25.578
Yeah, and we're getting
even more buried

22:25.612 --> 22:27.514
while we stand here
arguing about it.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.481
...I somehow managed

22:28.515 --> 22:29.449
to talk her into to detox.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.517
Before I can get her a bed

22:30.550 --> 22:31.918
we let her dealer
pimp boyfriend

22:31.951 --> 22:33.786
walk in here and waltz her
right back out.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.422
John, I am just as
frustrated about this...

22:35.455 --> 22:36.956
Then do something
about it!

22:36.989 --> 22:38.458
I am!

22:39.759 --> 22:41.127
Just treat your patients.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.996
Wow, way to go, boss.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.699
Frank, where's
the yellow pages?

22:46.733 --> 22:48.535
Bottom shelf.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.706
Hey, in the future

22:53.740 --> 22:56.142
can we try not to agitate
the drug seekers?

22:56.175 --> 22:58.478
It's not my fault
they got a gun in here.

22:58.511 --> 22:59.579
I never said it was.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.113
What are you doing?

23:01.147 --> 23:04.050
I'm ordering
metal detectors.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.718
Now you're talking.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.854
Let's get some cattle prods
while you're at it.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.689
Shut up, Frank.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.790
So he went home,
got the gun

23:10.823 --> 23:12.091
and came
all the way back.

23:12.124 --> 23:13.960
He probably went to
the corner and bought it.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.094
CHUNY:
Dr. Lewis.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.464
God, sometimes
I hate this place.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.465
Sometimes?

23:18.465 --> 23:19.899
CHUNY:
Pulse ox 90.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.601
He vomited twice
before I could turn him.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.636
There's little use
for the PEG now.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.104
He can't breath.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.873
Get an RT and set up
for a vent.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.107
Okay, he's full
of junk.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.709
Aspirated and decreased
on the right.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.544
Not again.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.780
His cords are scarred
from last year.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.148
He was on the vent
two months.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.684
Meds are in.
Okay.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.951
Be ready to roll him.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.788
The etomidate
might make him vomit.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.491
Once you put the tube in,
that's it, right?

23:46.593 --> 23:49.061
That's not coming out.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.700
No, that's... yeah,
we want the bulletproof.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.834
What's he doing?

23:54.867 --> 23:57.003
Contracting out
our new triage area.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.037
Are we finally getting that?

23:58.070 --> 23:59.205
Yeah, yeah,
and I've got

23:59.238 --> 24:00.873
the phony purchase
orders to prove it.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.542
Gallant, what did I
just tell you about Stella?

24:02.575 --> 24:04.010
What? She has
a positive Murphy sign.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.012
That's because you keep
feeding her cafeteria food.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.847
Dr. Carter, I still need
to rule out cholelithiasis.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.815
Yes.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.182
Do it.
Get her out of here.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.118
Street her before she presents
with something else.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.153
She's going to suck
him dry, isn't she?

24:14.186 --> 24:15.221
Yes, she is.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.023
No, no, sooner than that.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.858
As soon as you can.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.160
Why don't you just come out
and take a look at the space?

24:22.529 --> 24:23.863
What are you doing?

24:25.565 --> 24:28.134
I'm trying
to make us all safer.

24:28.167 --> 24:31.237
You ordered six
metal detectors retail?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.740
Yeah, they should be here
in about a half an hour.

24:33.773 --> 24:34.807
No.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.909
We have a procurement
department

24:36.943 --> 24:39.546
that handles all
capital expenditures.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.813
You canceled it.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.849
Yes, I canceled it.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.283
This is not your job

24:44.316 --> 24:46.185
and believe me,
you don't want it.

24:46.218 --> 24:49.556
We had another 15%
budget reduction
again this year.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.557
I am just trying
to keep the doors open.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.691
Well, close them

24:51.724 --> 24:53.192
'cause it's not worth it.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.094
You shouldn't have to risk
your life to work here.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.229
Of course not,
but you have to be
responsible about it.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.965
You have to get
competitive bids.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.567
No, Kerry, you know
what's irresponsible

25:00.567 --> 25:02.101
is letting this go on
as long as we have.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.136
And I have been
in staff meetings

25:04.170 --> 25:05.304
14 hours a month

25:05.337 --> 25:07.974
for the past two years
working on this.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.878
Where you going?

25:11.911 --> 25:14.681
To the ambulance bay
to wait for my metal detectors.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.988
When he calms down
have him see me.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.056
Abby?

25:24.090 --> 25:28.160
( phone ringing )

25:28.194 --> 25:30.797
Answer the phone,
Frank.

25:36.235 --> 25:39.138
You know, we have
patients to care for.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.607
He's right, Kerry.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.826
Do you have a plan?

26:01.127 --> 26:02.829
No.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.370
Plain or peanut?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.272
Huh?

26:13.305 --> 26:14.774
M&Ms.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.342
Oh...

26:16.375 --> 26:18.144
No?

26:18.177 --> 26:21.080
Gum? Cheetos?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.982
How 'bout some nylons?

26:23.015 --> 26:24.784
What?

26:24.817 --> 26:28.655
Well, I hear they sell panties
in vending machines in Japan.

26:28.655 --> 26:31.323
Save your quarters.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.726
You sure?

26:33.760 --> 26:37.329
You know, chocolate is
the universal comfort food.

26:37.363 --> 26:41.100
Listen, I'm sorry
about what happened.

26:41.133 --> 26:45.672
But the guy was
a known drug hound

26:45.705 --> 26:48.675
and I wasn't going
to play his game.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.076
But you got to understand

26:50.109 --> 26:52.244
I would never do anything
to jeopardize you.

26:52.278 --> 26:56.248
Carter, maybe, but not you.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.250
Not my future lover.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.787
( chuckles )

27:00.820 --> 27:03.122
Hey, look, look, look,
I'm sorry, okay?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.191
Look, sometimes I get a little
punchy when I get nervous.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.225
Hey, I was scared, too.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.427
Oh, oh, you were scared?

27:08.460 --> 27:11.998
You know, I'm the one who almost
had a cap busted in my head.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.399
( chuckles )

27:13.432 --> 27:15.802
Oh, oh,
and that's funny, too.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.303
Cap busted
in your head?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.205
Come here, come here.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.406
No. What are you doing?
Pratt?

27:20.439 --> 27:21.808
I'm consoling you.

27:21.841 --> 27:22.909
Well, don't.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.314
All right?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.249
( sniffling )

27:40.259 --> 27:42.729
You finished?

27:42.762 --> 27:45.097
Yeah.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.100
Plain.

27:48.134 --> 27:51.437
I want plain M&Ms.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.307
Voila.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.349
Did you hear
a fire alarm?

28:03.382 --> 28:06.285
Oh, not another
evacuation.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.462
Now what?

28:16.495 --> 28:19.398
I have no idea.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.366
Well, you got
everybody out here.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.201
You should say something.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.070
Why are you talking to me like
we're planning a prison break?

28:24.103 --> 28:25.337
In case this thing
gets ugly.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.472
You don't know me?
That's right.

28:26.505 --> 28:30.276
Hey, what's going on?

28:30.309 --> 28:31.878
Talk to Norma Rae.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.847
We're not working

28:34.881 --> 28:36.515
until the install
some metal detectors

28:36.548 --> 28:38.217
and get some
additional security.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.085
Really?

28:39.118 --> 28:40.386
Oh, cool.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.121
My shift's over
in an hour anyway.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.222
Uh-oh, looks like
a showdown.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.292
Listen up!

28:46.325 --> 28:48.327
Unless you are on
a scheduled break

28:48.360 --> 28:52.164
you are in violation
of your hospital contract

28:52.198 --> 28:55.267
and are all in danger
of being summarily fired.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.969
Part of our contract
guarantees

28:57.003 --> 28:58.304
that the hospital
provides us

28:58.337 --> 29:00.172
with a safe
working environment.

29:00.206 --> 29:04.010
Look, today's incident
was, uh, eh... horrific

29:04.043 --> 29:06.278
but we are already taking steps

29:06.312 --> 29:07.914
to ensure that
it doesn't happen again.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.515
You always say that,
but nothing ever happens.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.417
I don't always say that.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.952
We've heard it before.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.821
And this is how you choose
to solve the problem?

29:14.854 --> 29:15.888
Hey, what's going on?

29:17.857 --> 29:18.825
We got
a 62-year-old man

29:18.858 --> 29:19.458
hypotension, low back pain.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.893
BP's 80 palp.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.328
You better do something
about this today.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.263
Yeah, and everyone here
needs to get back in there

29:24.296 --> 29:25.231
while they
still have a job.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.398
Don't even think about

29:26.432 --> 29:27.834
touching
that patient, Gallant.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.269
Get him in there,
Gallant.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.537
Gallant,
you are a student.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.840
You don't have a contract,
you just fail.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.016
All right, let's go.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.551
Could be
a ruptured aneurysm.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.941
Hi.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.609
It'll be another couple hours

30:10.642 --> 30:12.378
before I can get him
up to the OR.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.213
But his stats
have leveled off

30:14.246 --> 30:16.548
and we're giving him
as much pain medication

30:16.582 --> 30:18.617
as his blood pressure
can tolerate.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.321
Do you know what it's like to
watch someone die for 25 years?

30:24.056 --> 30:26.025
That's what I did
with his father.

30:26.058 --> 30:34.266
Every day.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.136
I can refer you
to another nursing home.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.371
I don't know what
you're planning now...

30:39.405 --> 30:41.407
He was a singer.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.942
Did you know?

30:45.577 --> 30:49.415
When he sang, it was the most
beautiful sound in the world.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.951
And I...

30:51.984 --> 30:55.854
I prayed it would pass him over.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.127
When he got to be 29, I thought

31:01.160 --> 31:05.597
my God, maybe we got lucky.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.670
Then he started
having trouble at work.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.406
He'd forget things...

31:14.440 --> 31:16.308
and when he'd talk

31:16.342 --> 31:19.979
sometimes it was
hard to understand.

31:20.012 --> 31:23.049
And of course...

31:26.685 --> 31:31.357
of course, he couldn't sing...
anymore.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.694
It just takes
everything away.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.230
You... everything.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.271
Can I have a piece of paper?

31:45.304 --> 31:47.339
What for?

31:47.373 --> 31:49.541
I'm going to start work
on my resume.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.378
You'll be fine.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.446
I know.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.382
Usually they just
decapitate the leaders

31:56.415 --> 31:58.017
of the insurrection

31:58.050 --> 32:00.352
and send the peasants
back to work tending the fields

32:00.386 --> 32:02.421
but thank you.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.291
What took you so long?

32:05.324 --> 32:08.127
Abby, I need a repeat blood gas
on my Huntington's patient.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.096
We're staging a walkout.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.463
Yeah, I get that.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.099
I need a PH.
He's throwing PVC's.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.466
In fact, I have ten
other patients

32:14.500 --> 32:18.370
on monitored beds
who no one is watching.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.572
So maybe somebody will
pay attention.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.630
So you quit, go
outside and pout?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.032
Too many patients.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.266
No room.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.035
Overwhelmed staff,
and it's dangerous.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.437
This keeps up, we're not
going to able to treat anybody.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.106
News flash:
The healthcare system sucks.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.707
Our job is to
treat people
in spite of it.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.343
Well, I can't.
Not anymore.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.046
And I don't expect you
or anybody else here not to.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.113
But I can't do it.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.065
So, too bad to the
ten-year-old with status

33:19.098 --> 33:20.466
asthmaticus arrests?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.134
We've had one staff member
murdered on duty...

33:22.168 --> 33:23.702
Or the mother of three
with pyelo...

33:23.735 --> 33:26.272
I'm trying to save the people
that roll in here tomorrow!

33:26.305 --> 33:28.307
I know, Carter, you're
an emergency room doctor.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.342
It's about getting
through the shift.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.111
Do you even know
how many guns and knives

33:32.144 --> 33:33.445
pass through here
in a year?

33:47.826 --> 33:50.462
( sighs )

33:57.269 --> 33:59.205
LEWIS:
No, I don't.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.473
But I do know how
many people are
depending on us

34:01.507 --> 34:02.508
at this very moment.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.575
I got stabbed.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.111
Lucy got killed.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.812
And today, Abby and Chen get
a gun to their head.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.214
I'm sorry. No.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.748
( sighs )
It's got to stop.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.750
Otherwise, it's not worth doing.

34:11.783 --> 34:12.717
Fine. You know what?

34:12.751 --> 34:13.585
You fix tomorrow.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.121
I have to go

34:15.121 --> 34:17.356
treat the patients
that need us today.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.799
( sighs )

35:12.511 --> 35:14.580
He coded?

35:23.789 --> 35:26.258
You think they closed
the paramedic runs?

35:26.292 --> 35:27.393
I can't tell.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.228
Think that they
replaced us all?

35:29.261 --> 35:30.396
I can't tell.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.664
Think it's going
to rain?

35:34.633 --> 35:35.834
Look-- a new recruit.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.371
Shouldn't she be waving
a white flag?

35:39.405 --> 35:42.208
Dr. Carter, let's, uh,
take a walk.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.315
The metal detectors will
be here either tonight

35:49.348 --> 35:50.549
or tomorrow morning.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.451
And we've accelerated
our negotiation

35:52.484 --> 35:55.221
with the new security firm.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.223
What about triage?

35:57.256 --> 35:59.625
Construction starts as soon
as we can approve the bids.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.694
Thank you.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.596
No. No, you don't get
to thank me.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.233
You get to go back inside
and clear off that board.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.867
You were already
four hours behind.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.436
Fair enough.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.670
And it will be hard

36:11.703 --> 36:14.673
to avoid a disciplinary
committee hearing.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.678
It's nothing
personal, Kerry.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.947
Yeah, well, uh,
speaking of that

36:21.980 --> 36:25.351
I had hoped to control
some of these costs

36:25.384 --> 36:28.620
but now that we're paying more
for immediacy

36:28.654 --> 36:30.656
you'll have to offset that

36:30.689 --> 36:33.792
by either laying off
three senior nurses

36:33.825 --> 36:37.763
and hiring new grads,
or canceling X-ray

36:37.796 --> 36:40.399
and lab service after 10:00 p.m.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.801
Whatever you think.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.804
No. You forced us
to do it this way.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.640
You get to decide.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.276
Well, you can't
run a trauma

36:50.276 --> 36:51.777
in the middle
of the night

36:51.810 --> 36:53.512
and have to go
to the lab.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.382
That's true.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.685
Nurses then.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.354
Three.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.822
I want their names
on my desk

37:03.855 --> 37:05.724
first thing in the morning.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.303
( applause )

37:17.303 --> 37:18.437
Congratulations.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.705
Thank you.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.872
Very nice,
very nice.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.040
( chuckles )

37:22.073 --> 37:23.041
( sighs )

37:23.074 --> 37:24.576
What are you doing?

37:24.610 --> 37:25.944
I know you're not
going back inside.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.313
Oh, I got patients.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.514
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

37:28.547 --> 37:29.815
Shouldn't you
be getting

37:29.848 --> 37:31.450
like, some very serious
therapy right now?

37:31.483 --> 37:35.421
What, and ruin all this hard-won
repression and denial?

37:35.454 --> 37:37.456
So, you're serious, huh?

37:37.489 --> 37:38.524
Go home, Pratt.

37:38.557 --> 37:39.791
Are you sure you're good?

37:39.825 --> 37:40.926
You know, it's
not your fault.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.328
Go home.
All right.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.529
Okay.
You okay?

37:43.562 --> 37:45.030
Oh, people have
to stop asking me that.

37:45.063 --> 37:46.365
Okay.
Yo, I am
Spartacus.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.599
Come here.

37:47.633 --> 37:48.867
That proletarian
revolt you staged

37:48.900 --> 37:50.502
left us a little
short-handed down here.

37:50.536 --> 37:51.737
( laughs )

37:51.770 --> 37:53.339
Oh, did you think
that was clever?

37:53.372 --> 37:53.972
Yeah.
It wasn't a joke.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.006
Sorry.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.975
I told Weaver
to fire you

37:57.008 --> 37:59.445
but, uh, you can't
trust a lesbian
to do a man's job

37:59.478 --> 38:01.513
so instead, I ended
baby-sitting three gorks

38:01.547 --> 38:02.748
and a dirtball
with the DT's.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.416
Last time I did
ER scut work

38:04.450 --> 38:05.751
I had ponytail
and a lava lamp.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.853
I do not enjoy
revisiting those days.

38:07.886 --> 38:08.720
Am I clear,
Dr. Carter?

38:08.754 --> 38:10.055
Yeah.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.957
Dr. Romano, uh, the TAB is
"A" negative.

38:11.990 --> 38:12.991
Should we give her RhoGAM?

38:13.024 --> 38:14.693
Huh. Well, apparently

38:14.726 --> 38:16.628
some of the med
students take their
oaths a little

38:16.662 --> 38:20.599
more seriously
than the doctors.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.833
No. She gave
this speech about

38:21.867 --> 38:23.502
what it means
to be a doctor.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.572
Well, that you need
to figure out all by yourself.

38:26.605 --> 38:27.773
I'm looking for a doctor.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.641
Why don't you try
sitting in chairs?

38:29.675 --> 38:30.842
Right over there.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.611
We'll be with you
as soon as we can.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.613
Is it true construction is
starting in a week?

38:34.646 --> 38:35.847
I don't know.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.617
You know what they say
about construction.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.686
Nice work,
Dr. Carter.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.688
Oh, let's hope
you feel that way tomorrow.

38:42.721 --> 38:43.689
What do you mean?

38:43.722 --> 38:44.690
You should go home.

38:44.723 --> 38:45.624
And lie down?
And lie down.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.658
Yeah.
Yeah.

38:46.692 --> 38:47.959
Dr. Carter,
I need you

38:47.993 --> 38:49.461
to sign a Prevacid
script for Exam One.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.762
Stella?

38:50.796 --> 38:52.764
Yeah, well, she still has
a esophageal reflux.

38:52.798 --> 38:53.799
She's still here?

38:53.832 --> 38:54.766
I was outside with you.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.901
Which I appreciate.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.002
( clears throat )

38:57.035 --> 38:58.504
Hmm.

38:58.537 --> 38:59.971
I'm looking for a doctor.
Oh, right here.

39:00.005 --> 39:00.906
We're very
busy, sir.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.574
You need to
take a seat

39:02.608 --> 39:04.410
and someone will
see you as soon
as they can.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.110
I need to see him.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.612
I know he works here.

39:06.645 --> 39:07.813
Did he treat you
for something or... ?

39:07.846 --> 39:08.814
I don't know
how to get home.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.449
Security!
I lost my way.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.817
You can't be here,
and I can't help you

39:11.850 --> 39:13.752
unless you tell me
who you're looking for.

39:13.785 --> 39:14.586
Tell me where he is.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.721
We need you to leave.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.556
Hold on.
I took the wrong train.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.857
I didn't know
which way to go.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.692
Where do you live?
G. Get G.

39:20.726 --> 39:21.827
He's my brother.

39:21.860 --> 39:22.861
Who? Who is G?

39:22.894 --> 39:23.962
G! Greg!

39:23.995 --> 39:25.431
What does
Greg stand for?

39:25.464 --> 39:26.898
( crying ):
Greg Pratt.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.067
Somebody get Greg Pratt
for me, please.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.169
( crying )

39:31.202 --> 39:33.639
* Won't you take me to...
Funky Town? *

39:33.672 --> 39:34.806
New career?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.775
I've been on hold
for 15 minutes.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.510
Hold that. Trubull's
had his ReoPro.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.545
Let's move him
to the cath lab.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.746
Uh-huh, mm-hmm.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.147
Shelby's chest
is negative.

39:42.180 --> 39:43.849
Let's treat him
with ibuprofen.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.485
Yeah, I'm still waiting
on the dig level on Six.

39:46.518 --> 39:47.853
What's his name?
Uh, Cardova.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.788
Yeah, find him,
get it, and
then find me.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.490
Okay, great.
Can you find
my stethoscope?

39:51.523 --> 39:53.158
I left it in
the ambulance
bay somewhere.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.761
Wasn't your shift over,
like, four and half hours ago?

39:55.794 --> 39:56.795
Five and a half.

39:56.828 --> 39:57.696
How long are you staying?

39:57.729 --> 39:59.798
Till we clear the board.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.199
So, you decided
to die here, huh?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.001
Uh, excuse me.
Deb, I sent you home.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.036
You know, I was in the middle
of six criticals

40:05.070 --> 40:06.004
when that psycho came back.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.839
So, go home now.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.041
No. I-I've got
about a dozen
charts to finish.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.176
Oh, forget the charts.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.210
I just got stood up.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.211
Let's go hit a club.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.813
What?
Hot date?

40:14.846 --> 40:16.548
Hot, but clearly not datable.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.049
Orbital's playing
at the Shadow Room.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.751
You know, what the hell?

40:19.785 --> 40:22.020
I lost a patient;
I almost got killed by another.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.188
I'm in.

40:23.221 --> 40:24.556
You, too, Abby.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.791
Girl's night out?

40:25.824 --> 40:27.559
No, I think I'm
going to go home.

40:27.593 --> 40:28.560
Yeah, if I'm going

40:28.594 --> 40:29.928
you're going.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.231
You're asking him?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.933
Okay. No, uh,
late night

40:34.966 --> 40:35.867
confessions.

40:35.901 --> 40:36.968
No male strippers.

40:37.002 --> 40:37.969
Okay, you got it.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.204
Give me ten minutes.

40:40.939 --> 40:41.807
What?

40:41.840 --> 40:42.808
What?

40:42.841 --> 40:43.975
FRANK:
Dr. Lewis

40:44.009 --> 40:45.511
Dr. Tsung on three.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.645
Who?

40:46.678 --> 40:48.213
Primary on your Huntington's.

40:48.246 --> 40:50.115
Dr. Tsung, this is Dr. Lewis.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.584
I saw your patient,
Phillip Berk.

40:52.618 --> 40:53.585
Right.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.920
He came in this morning

40:54.953 --> 40:57.255
with aspiration, pneumonia,
and cellulitis.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.925
We intubated him
and gave him antibiotics

40:59.958 --> 41:02.961
but he got septic
and died about an hour ago.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.897
Have you seen him
in the last month?

41:05.931 --> 41:08.867
Yeah. Would you mind
signing the death certificate?

41:08.900 --> 41:10.836
Yes. Yes, thank you.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.805
Thank you.
I'll send it right over.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.107
No coroner?

41:16.141 --> 41:18.677
We can release the body
to the mortuary.

41:31.890 --> 41:32.758
Are you older or younger?

41:32.791 --> 41:33.959
Older.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.794
His mama took me
in when I was nine.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.563
Oh.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.665
Was she nice?

41:39.698 --> 41:40.766
Not really.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.234
So, what happened
to your family?

41:43.268 --> 41:45.737
Don't know,
don't care.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.806
G's my family.

41:50.642 --> 41:51.843
What happened to you?

41:51.877 --> 41:52.944
I went by the hospital.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.580
What, you got lost again?

41:54.613 --> 41:56.915
I remembered where
the hospital was.

41:56.948 --> 41:57.849
Come on.

41:57.883 --> 41:58.984
Come on.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.085
Look, I tried
to call you.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.319
Nobody answered

42:01.352 --> 42:02.788
so I got Shannon
down in personnel

42:02.821 --> 42:03.989
to get me
your address.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.791
That place sucks, G.

42:05.824 --> 42:08.026
Yeah, thanks.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.766
I knew I threw my back out
as soon as I fell.

42:14.800 --> 42:15.867
MAN:
How you doin'?

42:15.901 --> 42:17.335
My chiropractor--

42:17.368 --> 42:18.770
she says I have mild scoliosis.

42:18.804 --> 42:20.606
Everybody's got
mild scoliosis.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.808
That's just something
chiropractors say.

42:22.841 --> 42:23.875
You can't give me anything?

42:23.909 --> 42:25.210
No. I think
you'll be fine.

42:25.243 --> 42:26.211
Oh, Donahue is

42:26.244 --> 42:27.713
guaiac negative.

42:27.746 --> 42:29.247
Schwartz's repeat
accu-check is 87

42:29.280 --> 42:31.950
and the urine Icon
is positive
for Mr. Ramirez.

42:31.983 --> 42:32.984
Can I go home now?

42:33.018 --> 42:34.152
Find my, um... ?
Yes.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.687
LOL with altered
mental status

42:35.721 --> 42:36.855
and lower abdominal pain.

42:36.888 --> 42:37.823
LOL?

42:37.856 --> 42:38.957
Little old lady.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.859
How you doin'?

42:40.892 --> 42:42.794
All right, down to one board.

42:42.828 --> 42:44.162
Dr. Carter, thought
you might want

42:44.195 --> 42:45.631
to sign for these.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.232
Four entrances,
six metal detectors. Rush.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.233
How you doin'?
How you doin'?

42:48.266 --> 42:49.768
Yeah, that's right.

42:49.801 --> 42:51.169
How you doin'?
How you doin'?

42:51.202 --> 42:52.938
You want to show me
where you want them?

42:52.971 --> 42:54.673
Right this way.

42:54.706 --> 42:55.807
* Oh...

42:55.841 --> 42:57.042
How you doin'?

42:57.075 --> 42:58.944
Don't make many
night deliveries.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.746
We got to pull
the old ones out?

43:00.779 --> 43:01.880
No. These are the first.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.249
Hey, how you doin'?

43:04.282 --> 43:06.652
I'm good.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.891
( dance music plays )

43:15.961 --> 43:18.664
That is the last
time I ask a guy out.

43:18.664 --> 43:20.365
Oh, you asked him out?

43:20.398 --> 43:23.101
Yes, and he
stands me up.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.770
Who was he?

43:24.803 --> 43:25.871
Oh, he's in...

43:25.904 --> 43:28.373
venture...
ca-capitalist... m.

43:28.406 --> 43:30.709
Or private equity.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.177
Something or other.
I don't know.

43:32.210 --> 43:34.145
One of those
undefinable money jobs.

43:34.179 --> 43:36.114
See, then, right now

43:36.147 --> 43:39.851
you'd probably be sitting
in his apartment listening to...

43:39.885 --> 43:42.220
Thelonious Monk... or...

43:42.253 --> 43:43.221
something.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.690
You're right.

43:44.723 --> 43:47.158
But women who date
those kind of men

43:47.192 --> 43:48.860
don't get vomited on

43:48.894 --> 43:49.895
on a regular basis.

43:49.928 --> 43:51.930
Or get a gun to the head.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.131
Another one?

43:53.164 --> 43:55.133
Yes, thank you.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.303
No, thanks.

43:58.336 --> 43:59.805
Where is she anyway?

43:59.838 --> 44:02.273
I think she went
to the bathroom.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.209
You think
she'll be okay?

44:07.879 --> 44:10.048
Yeah, I think
she's going to be fine.
