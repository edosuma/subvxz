08:45.392 --> 08:48.460
Well, gee, let me give

08:48.462 --> 08:52.063

sawchuck's angels.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.674

09:02.676 --> 09:06.044
Oh, and here's my parents,
carol and marsha.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.847
Oh, your dad
was named carol, too?
No, marsha.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.815
Moving on.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.720
And this is glen's room.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.391
He was trying
not to get the virus.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.459
He got it.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.563
And this is bernice's room.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.165
And that's her skeleton.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.400
God, carol.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.968
Oh, no, she
studied anatomy.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.572
Oh. Okay.
Yeah.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.342
And this is my room.

09:40.012 --> 09:43.548
Each object in here
is hand-crafted by myself

09:43.550 --> 09:45.750
As a cherished tribute
to a friend

09:45.752 --> 09:50.355
Or family member
who died from the virus.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.190
Yeah. Yeah.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.792
Well, it's, uh,

09:53.794 --> 09:55.527
It's really, uh...

09:55.529 --> 09:57.529
Something.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.598
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.934
I know it looks like I went
a little cuckoo bananas.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.937
No, it doesn't. This looks...

10:05.939 --> 10:08.707
Absolutely chock-full of sanity.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.942
Yeah.

10:20.419 --> 10:21.886
Thank you.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.656
Thank<i> you</i> for the
surprise, phil.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.891
So nice to visit
your hometown.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.260
Well, you know, it doesn't
have to just be a visit.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.096
No. No, no,

10:31.098 --> 10:32.597
Not delaware.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.898
(sighs)
here we go again.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.500
And what's wrong with delaware?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.002
Well, there's no one here.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.771
Carol, there's no one
anywhere anymore.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.773
That's not exactly true.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.675
Okay, what...
What's that supposed to mean?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.577
Nothing, it's
just nothing.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.312
Tucson? Are you
talking about tucson?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.981
Just saying that's where
there are other people, phil.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.451
Carol, the only place
I can't go is tucson.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.454
I mean, do you not remember me
getting, like, tackled,

10:56.456 --> 10:58.657
Driven out into the desert
and left there for dead?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.291
Yes, I do, I...
No, no, no.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.293
And the implication
was very strong

11:02.295 --> 11:04.763
That if I ever came back there,
phil would kill me.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.331
But it's been,
like, six months.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.199
I mean, maybe they've
cooled off by now.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.368
We just don't know.
No, I don't care. Screw 'em.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.804
We're the last people
on earth, phil.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.773
Shouldn't we all
be together?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.341
You made your choice.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.610
If you want to be
with me, be with me,

11:18.612 --> 11:20.612
But I am not going
back to tucson.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.247
Ever.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.650
I'm gonna sleep
in bernice's room.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.651
Fine.
Fine.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.852
Fine.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.688

11:34.394 --> 11:35.694
What?

11:35.696 --> 11:38.163
Your stupid sleep apnea machine.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.231
I'll use bernice's.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.915
No, look, it's not that easy.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.751
