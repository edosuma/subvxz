00:01.043 --> 00:03.910
"On my honor, |wi||
never betray my badge,

00:03.962 --> 00:08.422
my integrity, my character
or the public trust."

00:08.467 --> 00:10.082
Oath of Honor?

00:11.470 --> 00:13.176
| memorized it as a kid.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.431
| used to make my dad
say it to me every morning

00:17.476 --> 00:19.262
before he went to work.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.051
Thought it might keep him safe.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.517
He used to say to me,

00:25.567 --> 00:28.730
"I'll do my best, kiddo,
but I'm only human."

00:31.156 --> 00:32.396
(voice breaking) Every time.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.446
God, it used to make me so angry.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.741
Andy, it's gonna be okay.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.246
What am I gonna do?

00:45.295 --> 00:46.956
(sniffles)

00:47.005 --> 00:47.915
Please.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.630
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.426
(voices amplified)
J‘ Sail away with me J‘

00:54.471 --> 00:56.177
J‘ To another world J‘

00:56.223 --> 00:57.884
What are we singing?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.007
No way, dude. I live with you.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.016
I've heard you sing in the shower.
Don't bring me down.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.268
You're not gonna sing with me?

01:03.313 --> 01:05.178
— No. No.
— Are you gonna sing with me?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.063
No. I, too, have heard you
in the shower.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.724
Gail will sing with you.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.313
No, l don't——| don't——
I don't sing.

01:10.362 --> 01:11.693
— Andy.
— What?

01:11.738 --> 01:13.023
— No, no, no, no.
— (cheering and applause)

01:13.073 --> 01:15.359
I will never be drunk enough
to get up there.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.778
Next up, Officer Nash!

01:21.832 --> 01:24.289
(cheenng)

01:24.334 --> 01:26.541
Nash! Whoo!

01:26.587 --> 01:28.293
— Find me something easy.
— ("Let's Get It On" playing)

01:28.338 --> 01:31.171
— (cell phone rings)
— J‘ I've been really trying J‘

01:31.216 --> 01:34.049
J‘ Baby J‘

01:34.094 --> 01:37.427
J‘ Trying to hold back this feeling J‘

01:37.472 --> 01:39.804
— Yeah. I can't hear you.
— J‘ For so long J‘

01:39.850 --> 01:42.592
J‘ And if you feel J‘

01:42.644 --> 01:45.260
J‘ Like I feel, baby J‘

01:45.314 --> 01:47.100
— I'm leaving now.
— J‘ Come on J‘

01:47.149 --> 01:48.514
(Traci) J‘ Come on J‘

01:48.567 --> 01:50.398
— Whoo!
— Hoo!

01:50.444 --> 01:52.856
J‘ Let's get it on J‘

01:52.904 --> 01:55.941
—J‘HeyJ‘
—J‘BabyJ‘

01:55.991 --> 01:58.198
(Sam) Almost makes me
wish I was there.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.949
Yeah? What would you sing?

01:59.995 --> 02:01.531
(faucet squeaks)

02:01.580 --> 02:03.036
(sighs)

02:03.749 --> 02:05.239
"Stuck in the Middle with You."

02:05.292 --> 02:06.907
"Stuck in the Middle with You."
That's nice.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.996
No, no, "Love," uh——
"Love the One You're With."

02:09.046 --> 02:11.332
Yeah? How 'bout "All By Myself"?

02:11.381 --> 02:13.042
Mm, no, you're not.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.592
(Andy giggles) You will be.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.045
(chuckles)

02:16.094 --> 02:19.086
You shut up.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.552
Thanks. I'm kidding.
I wouldn't sing.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.466
I know you wouldn't.
You're too cool.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.761
Hey, I do a lot of things, all right?
I cook. I clean.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.476
I'm good with tools.
I'm an excellent driver.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.732
You ever wish we were normal?

02:32.778 --> 02:34.484
What do you mean?
We are normal.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.518
You know what I mean.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.448
(clears throat) Andy,
if I could ask you to stay,

02:40.494 --> 02:42.576
I would.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.374
Then ask me to stay.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.412
Just one night. You know,
I'll go home in the morning.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.332
Besides, it's freezing outside.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.126
Well, it's cold.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.886
Hey, it'd be practically inhuman
to make me go back out there.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.093
(Sam sighs)

03:13.235 --> 03:15.442
Stay.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.068
Okay.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.905
So, you know, I stayed over.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.116
Then yesterday,
when I'm just about to leave,

03:27.165 --> 03:28.371
Jamie Brennan shows up.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.157
When did Sam disappear?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.950
Sometime last night.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.003
I don't know what happened.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.457
McNally, they're ready for you.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.545
(Andy) Okay.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.680
What if we don't find him?
What if it's all my fault?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.721
(police radio chatter)

03:58.029 --> 04:00.190
J‘ I like big butts, and I cannot lie J‘

04:00.240 --> 04:01.571
— Would you stop?
— J‘ You other—— J‘

04:01.616 --> 04:03.072
Dude, it's your fault for singing it.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.483
I've had it stuck in my head
for, like, two days.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.946
So? "Baby's Got Back."
I don't regret it.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.861
"Endless Love" duet with you,
that I regret.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.620
Hey, five minutes, parade room.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.078
— (Dov) What's going on?
— Swarek disappeared last night.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.913
He was working undercover.
He went off the grid.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.203
— He hasn't called in since.
— So? Swarek's a badass.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.211
He's probably wired up somewhere,

04:17.257 --> 04:18.622
playing poker with the bad guys.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.382
That's bad.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.463
Where's Andy?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.127
She's in with Boyd right now.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.881
Okay, one week ago,

04:27.934 --> 04:30.425
you bump into Swarek
on your undercover exercise.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.764
You meet at a bar.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.223
You go back
to his cover apartment together.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.106
Yes. I was only there
a few hours.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.608
— What about the other night?
— I told you. He called me.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.736
I went over for the second time,
and I spent the night.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.027
(Andy) l was so careful...

04:45.076 --> 04:46.282
Why can't they do this
in Frank's office?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.740
She's not a suspect.
She's a cop.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.404
No, she's a witness.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.867
Cop part doesn't matter right now.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.157
(Andy) ...two blocks away
from his apartment,

04:53.210 --> 04:54.916
and then I even walked
around the block...

04:54.961 --> 04:56.576
Anyway, we need it on camera.
Sammy shows up dead,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.120
we need her statement intact.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.082
— I'm sorry, sir.
— Briefing in five.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.000
I don't even know
what to say, McNally.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.716
This goes so far beyond rookie,
I don't even know——

05:06.765 --> 05:07.754
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.715
I want to talk about yesterday.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.636
I want you to walk me
through it again.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.976
Jamie Brennan showed up,
and he wanted to talk to Sam.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.232
Then what?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.108
He offered me a ride downtown.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.190
He drove me to the marina.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.151
We talked,
and then he dropped me off.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.906
What did you talk about?
Tell me again.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.489
(sighs) We talked about football,

05:29.538 --> 05:31.278
and we talked about his——

05:31.331 --> 05:34.414
his wife and his daughter Gracie.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.666
He said that they'd been in
a car accident, but, you know,

05:36.711 --> 05:38.121
he wasn't even sure that
they were in an accident.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.628
Look, l'm——What are we doing?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.756
— This is——This is pointless.
— Why?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.463
Because... he made you.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.423
There is a thousand ways
he could've done——

05:47.472 --> 05:49.383
I mean, I don't want to sit here
anymore thinking about which way

05:49.432 --> 05:52.845
he could've done——Look, the fact
is he did it! You got made.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.885
This guy is a pro.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.803
That is why I picked Swarek,

05:56.857 --> 05:59.644
because I thought
he had a fighting chance.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.560
The thing is, McNally...
(clicks teeth)

06:02.612 --> 06:03.818
you didn't.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.907
(door release buzzes, beeps)

06:11.830 --> 06:14.321
(door closes)

06:14.374 --> 06:16.285
Jamie Brennan——48 years old,

06:16.334 --> 06:18.325
former enforcer for the North End guys.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.085
Now he runs a trucking company
in Mississauga.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.338
He did a few years in Kingston Pen

06:23.383 --> 06:25.840
for smuggling, possession
for the purpose of trafficking,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.501
but we didn't get him
for any of the good stuff.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.919
What's the good stuff?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.554
Stuff with power tools,
people he tortured,

06:31.600 --> 06:32.555
people he killed.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.341
What was Swarek doing?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.430
Working in Brennan's warehouse,
making friends.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.764
Wanted to see if he
was still in the life,

06:37.814 --> 06:39.315
maybe get him
on one of those old homicides.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.018
So what happened?

06:41.067 --> 06:43.023
There was a breach.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.809
This is a surveillance video
from last night.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.855
(Sam) So what's happening, man?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.445
(Jamie) Where's, uh, Candice?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.074
(Sam) Uh, she's not back yet.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.202
I'm thinking about that, uh,
boat of yours.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.407
He didn't have time to call it in,

06:55.457 --> 06:56.788
because this was not
a scheduled meet.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.198
(Noelle) So no cover team.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.037
(Jamie) ...couple beers,
talk a little business.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.623
Unless you're busy——| don't
know——watching football or——

07:02.672 --> 07:06.210
No, no, l'm——l'm good.
I'm not a big football guy.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.124
So I'll meet you there, yeah.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.260
(Jamie) No use taking two cars.
I'm right outside.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.216
(Sam) Right on. Let's go.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.138
— That's it?
— We don't have cameras outside.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.519
So Sam hasn't called in
and Brennan's disappeared,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.976
so we treat it as suspicious
until we find him.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.310
Who's Candice?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.975
Okay, so Guns and Gangs

07:25.028 --> 07:27.485
have got people at Brennan's home
and his warehouse.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.736
Nothing's come up yet.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.898
So in the meantime,
we get to work on Brennan.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.408
I don't think I need to tell anybody
how urgent this is.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.115
— Let's go.
— (Luke) Jerry, who's Candice?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.244
The breach.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.791
Jerry.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.962
lt's McNally, all right?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.336
She's been seeing Sam
while he's undercover.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.336
We are canvassing
Brennan's immediate neighbors.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.632
Nothing fancy. Anybody seen him,
no big deal, okay?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.425
You will handle this low—key,
understood?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.059
— (Noelle) Peck, I want you...
— Excuse me.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.470
— going through Brennan's files.
— Sorry to bother you.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.808
See if there's any old addresses,

08:02.857 --> 08:03.812
— anyplace Brennan might be.
— You know what?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.564
— I can just wait.
— What?

08:05.610 --> 08:08.522
Hi. Uh, Pete Sun.
Officer Pete Sun.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.153
l'm, uh, here for my orientation day.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.197
— Oh, man.
— Oh, come on, Oliver.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.612
All right, look,
I forgot. Whatever.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.280
Uh, Epstein, Diaz, handle it.

08:21.960 --> 08:26.454
Parade room, locker room,
hand sanitizer, hallway.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.837
(Andy) Okay, fill me in.
What's the plan?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.964
We're canvassing,
talking to Brennan's neighbors.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.216
— What?
— Is she okay?

08:31.261 --> 08:32.922
I'm fine.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.507
Who are you?

08:34.556 --> 08:35.511
(Dov) New recruit.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.672
Great. Welcome to 15.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.011
What else did Jerry say?

08:39.060 --> 08:40.175
(Traci) Well, we got a unit...

08:40.228 --> 08:42.344
You hear any gossip today,
forget it.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.137
Why? What would I hear?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.396
Her T0. was undercover.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.648
Turns out they were
secretly, you know.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.229
Chris.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.111
Wow, that's a blatant
violation of protocol.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.363
Shut up. Come.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.150
Old pictures of cops,
interrogation room,

08:56.202 --> 08:57.738
bulletin board.

08:57.787 --> 09:02.497
(distant train whistle)

09:02.542 --> 09:04.043
(Sam groans)

09:11.092 --> 09:13.549
(grunting)

09:13.595 --> 09:14.755
(Jamie) Good.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.013
Was starting to worry.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.013
Hold still.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.444
Maggie never liked these much.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.820
White sheets,

09:34.574 --> 09:35.905
that's all she'd ever buy.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.783
Said it made her life feel clean.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.200
It's amazing what you do
for someone you love.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.750
Get rid of your sheets...

09:46.252 --> 09:47.833
car...

09:47.879 --> 09:49.210
your past.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.129
I would have done anything for her.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.385
(thud)

09:57.430 --> 09:58.806
I still would.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.969
Hi. This is Officer Diaz from 15 Division.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.182
Is this Mr. Lanyon?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.188
Mr. Lanyon, hi.
I'm just calling to check

10:09.234 --> 10:10.940
if you've seen one of your neighbors
in the last 24 hours——

10:10.985 --> 10:13.192
a man by the name
of Jamie Brennan.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.401
— What happened?
— He hung up.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.530
Who hangs up on the police?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.407
A lot of people, actually.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.239
But it's so rude. lt's disrespectful.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.574
Serve, protect and, uh,
get used to it.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.989
Hi, Mr. Lanyon.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.249
Hi. This is Officer Diaz
from 15 Division,

10:28.294 --> 10:30.376
and if you hang up on me again,
I can promise you

10:30.421 --> 10:32.036
I'll take a great deal of pleasure

10:32.090 --> 10:34.672
in coming down to your house
and questioning you in person.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.167
— That's what I thought.
— Yeah.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.092
(Andy) We were driving around,
you know, talking about football.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.226
Maybe that's where I screwed up.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.809
You know, ljust kept going on about
whatever's Oliver's talking about.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.270
Then we ended up in the marina.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.229
Why would he take you there?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.270
I thought he was gonna kill me,

10:56.322 --> 10:57.357
but then he got all quiet,

10:57.407 --> 10:59.523
and he started talking about
his wife, his daughter,

10:59.576 --> 11:02.033
and how they were
in a car accident and died.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.616
Yeah, but he was talking about
how his——his past came back,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.872
and, you know, that he wasn't
always a nice guy, which——

11:07.917 --> 11:09.782
Yeah, but for someone
who tortures people with pliers,

11:09.836 --> 11:11.417
he's been very nice
these last four years.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.793
He doesn't even have a parking ticket.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.251
So what changed?
Why take somebody hostage now?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.710
I don't know.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.626
— When did his wife die?
— Two months ago.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.465
All right, so let's take a look
at the accident.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.503
Maybe there's something there.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.399
It's an accident report.
Two fatalities——

11:35.445 --> 11:36.855
a mother
and her four—year—old daughter.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.486
Brennan's wife and daughter.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.271
Doesn't make me like him any better.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.782
That——That's not
what we're asking.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.160
Okay, then what are you asking?
Please enlighten me.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.492
What does his wife dying
in an accident have to do

11:48.541 --> 11:50.452
with the fact that we're missing
one of our officers?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.366
There are whole sections in here
that aren't filled out.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.876
There's no statements,
no witnesses,

11:53.922 --> 11:55.378
no reconstruction report.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.630
Okay, it's a crappy job with sloppy
papenNork. It happens.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.051
It's not sloppy. lt's incomplete.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.674
There's nothing here.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.085
Then you know what?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.719
Talk to the officer who filed it.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.928
Look, "G. Armstrong."
Probably still works in 34.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.512
Or don't.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.722
Obviously I want to find him, Luke.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.558
(Luke) I'll bet.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.610
Noelle, what are you doing here?

12:19.656 --> 12:23.114
l'm coordinating with 27.
We put out a BOLO on Brennan's car.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.445
No sign of him yet,
but we've got every squad in the city

12:25.495 --> 12:26.655
— keeping an eye out.
— Yeah, yeah, yeah,

12:26.704 --> 12:28.535
but what——
what are you doing here?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.536
I'm here to help.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.992
Yeah, but I thought today

12:31.042 --> 12:32.623
was the day that you were
gonna start your, um...

12:33.878 --> 12:35.584
take some personal time.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.713
Not now. Not with this.
I'm all right.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.918
| just need to be here.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.424
— (telephone rings)
— Yeah, but...

12:41.469 --> 12:43.676
— (picks up receiver)
— This is Officer Williams.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.508
Yeah. Mm—hmm.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.817
Four whole squad cars?
Busy,busy,busy.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.150
Don't be such a snot.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.156
— Why not? It works for me.
— Yeah.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.152
(Andy) G. Armstrong?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.034
— Officer Armstrong?
— Yeah.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.748
— Hi. Andy McNally.
— Giselle.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.788
— Hi. Gail Peck.
— Nice to meet you.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.706
Um, I expected you to be in uniform.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.135
| just made detective.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.132
— Oh.
— Oh, congratulations.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.045
Yeah. I couldn't wait to get
the hell out of those pants.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.838
It's a tough look to pull off.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.392
Though you two
seem to make it work.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.184
What can I do for you?

13:35.815 --> 13:36.895
Okay.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.977
(Andy) Is that you?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.187
Yeah.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.897
Is there anything you could tell us?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.561
I can tell you this case is closed.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.945
The woman who was killed,

13:44.991 --> 13:46.106
we're trying to track down her husband.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.115
So you pulled up her accident report.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.276
That seems a little weird.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.154
No, actually, what's weird is, um...

13:53.207 --> 13:56.370
this... this... and, oh, that.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.330
— Is she always this abrasive?
— You know what? I am, actually.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.415
We just have a few questions
about the report.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.671
I'd love to know what it takes
to make detective around here,

14:01.716 --> 14:03.172
because damn,
I think I should transfer,

14:03.217 --> 14:05.208
'cause this is some
seriously sloppy papenNork.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.134
(sighs)

14:10.183 --> 14:13.516
You guys feel like a coffee?
Latte? Cappuccino?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.643
We just got this new machine.
It's really cute.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.804
It uses these little pods.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.480
(birds chirping)

14:27.742 --> 14:29.858
(chuckles)

14:29.911 --> 14:32.152
Those things can
really dry out your mouth.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.585
Where the hell is Candice?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.541
Dropped her off downtown.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.134
What are you doing?

14:48.179 --> 14:49.760
Just looking for some answers.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.546
Answers for what?

14:51.599 --> 14:52.964
Questions that l have.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.349
And what makes you think
I got answers?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.137
"God's Good Grace."

14:58.189 --> 14:59.645
My boat?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.807
Jamie, I'm sorry for doing business

15:02.860 --> 15:04.851
out of your warehouse
without your permission.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.815
(laughs) That's funny.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.573
That's good. Look,
I've been out of the life for a while,

15:10.618 --> 15:12.404
but, you know, back in the day,

15:12.453 --> 15:15.991
there was this, uh, guy Wayne somethin'
from out east,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.076
used to run heroin up the coast.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.333
He got pinched last year
with a full load,

15:20.378 --> 15:23.620
so now he's doing 15 in Dorchester.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.506
Everything he had
is now property of the police,

15:26.551 --> 15:28.462
including his boat,

15:28.511 --> 15:30.297
"God's Good Grace."

15:30.930 --> 15:33.012
And I guess it still is.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.467
Right?

15:36.936 --> 15:37.891
Officer?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.232
So what am I doing here?

15:49.574 --> 15:51.986
I want to know what happened
to my family.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.025
I want to know
what happened to my family...

15:54.078 --> 15:56.740
(papers rustle)

15:56.789 --> 15:58.575
and why that accident report was faked.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.495
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.875
Oh, you don't.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.544
Uhh!

16:05.590 --> 16:06.921
(gasping)

16:06.966 --> 16:09.958
Someone killed my family,

16:10.011 --> 16:12.093
and the police covered it up.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.093
Jamie——

16:13.139 --> 16:15.130
You're gonna tell me who.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.549
Jamie, listen to me. l have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.059
Yeah, okay. Good.

16:24.901 --> 16:25.890
(sputters)

16:25.943 --> 16:27.058
Funny thing is...

16:27.111 --> 16:29.102
you think you can hold your breath,

16:29.155 --> 16:32.488
but a little gets down the throat, nose,

16:33.451 --> 16:37.615
the brain's hardwired
to think that it's drowning.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.780
Lungs contract.
Heart contracts.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.824
(sputtering and gasping)

16:48.591 --> 16:50.877
(wheezing and coughing)

16:50.927 --> 16:52.133
And, well, that happens.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.167
(coughs)

16:57.225 --> 16:59.261
Is this how things work in 15?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.346
You storm in all righteous and entitled,

17:01.395 --> 17:03.010
demanding things
from your superiors?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.020
We just want to know
what happened.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.899
Down here, you're in uniform,
Detective gives you an order, you take it.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.525
You do it.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.857
Greater good,
there's gotta be a reason.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.737
Yeah, reason being
so you can make detective.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.240
I did everything right.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.493
Yeah, accident looked weird to me.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.870
It didn't add up.

17:20.915 --> 17:24.032
I found two eyewitnesses
who saw some guy

17:24.085 --> 17:26.371
nosing around the car in the driveway
before it crashed.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.285
Even got the guy's
license plate number.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.797
The reconstruction guys came in,
our best mechanic.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.218
It was all in the report.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.626
(police radio chatter)

17:37.348 --> 17:40.010
(lowered voice)
Then some detective showed up,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.596
handed it back to me.
It was scrubbed.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.520
No notes. Different mechanic.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.022
Told me to sign off.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.273
What, that doesn't bother you?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.185
Where are you going?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.774
I'm tired of listening to your sermon.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.313
What, so you're just gonna walk away?

17:55.366 --> 17:58.608
No. I'm gonna give you
a copy of my notes.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.445
I kept 'em. I knew this
was gonna come back to me.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.989
l have everything——
the name of the witnesses,

18:05.042 --> 18:08.034
license plate number,
the guy they saw by the car...

18:08.087 --> 18:10.169
name of the mechanic
who ended up signing off.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.795
Yeah, what about the name
of the detective,

18:11.841 --> 18:13.172
the one that made it go away?

18:13.217 --> 18:15.594
Look, there is a huge difference

18:15.636 --> 18:18.048
between knowing your place
and covering up a homicide.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.389
He's not from this division.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.596
He works out of Guns and Gangs.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.022
(sighs)

18:28.608 --> 18:30.314
Guy's name is Boyd,

18:30.359 --> 18:31.860
Detective Donovan Boyd.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.616
All right, what do we do?

18:44.665 --> 18:45.871
I don't know. I'm thinking.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.497
You know, we gotta call Frank or Jerry.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.999
No! No, they're working with him right now.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.706
We might as well call Boyd himself.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.916
Just——What do we know?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.342
Okay, we know two witnesses
saw a guy near the car

18:55.384 --> 18:57.124
— right before it crashed.
— Okay.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.509
She said she got a plate.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.545
Okay. Find that. We'll run it.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.759
Maybe we can find out
who messed with the car.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.515
God, this woman
has terrible handwriting.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.301
I don't know what it is with lesbians,

19:07.355 --> 19:08.765
but they all have terrible handwriting,

19:08.814 --> 19:09.803
and they're always hitting on me.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.812
What are you talking about?

19:10.858 --> 19:11.813
Doesn't bother me.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.315
She's only human, Andy,

19:13.361 --> 19:14.521
and she was kinda cute——

19:14.570 --> 19:15.685
This has nothing to do with anything!

19:15.738 --> 19:16.693
What is the license plate number?

19:16.739 --> 19:19.230
I'm looking for it.

19:19.283 --> 19:22.150
Okay, well, this is the mechanic
who signed off on the report.

19:22.203 --> 19:25.115
Paul Kaminski.
Says he's right downtown.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.620
Okay, let's get the boys
to check it out.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.997
What are we gonna tell them?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.657
We're gonna tell 'em the truth.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.415
Nothing in the warehouse,
and nobody cares?

19:33.464 --> 19:35.671
I mean, what? The boss
doesn't show, nobody notices?

19:35.716 --> 19:36.922
It's——

19:37.718 --> 19:39.219
Yeah, well, figure it out,

19:39.261 --> 19:41.593
'cause we got a cop.
He's out there, and he's been made.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.879
Clock is ticking.

19:52.483 --> 19:53.893
Hey, where is everybody?

19:53.943 --> 19:55.183
I don't know.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.648
They're supposed to be on the phones,
canvassing the neighbors.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.528
I'm sure they are.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.069
What is that?
What are you looking at?

20:03.119 --> 20:05.656
Swarek's undercover file.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.945
This is confidential.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.955
Detective Barber gave it to me.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.161
You checked the boat, right?
"God's Good Grace"?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.712
It was part of Swarek's cover story.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.960
(folder clunks)

20:16.841 --> 20:18.502
Who's this guy?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.712
New guy. Orientation.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.838
Hey. What are you doing?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.142
Watching and learning, sir.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.015
Yeah? Where'd they go? The...

20:29.061 --> 20:30.642
Deckstein, Pez, whatever.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.020
— I don't know, sir.
— | asked you a question.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.932
Honestly, sir,
they, uh, wouldn't tell me.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.107
But I could take your lunch order.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.524
Look, we just want
to touch base, you know?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.737
There have been some questions.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.526
We just want to make sure
we have the right answers.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.036
Boyd wants us up to speed.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.537
So ask him.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.914
We're the ones that have
to talk to the family.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.415
They're coming in, threatening to sue.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.201
I mean, accident report's
a bit of a fairy tale,

20:55.254 --> 20:57.870
so what the hell
are we supposed to tell 'em?

20:57.923 --> 20:59.208
Tell 'em the truth.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.749
It's all right there.

21:01.802 --> 21:06.592
Oh, electrical system failed.
Brakes, steering, everything.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.679
Gas line was damaged.
Car hit a tree, and it went up.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.519
Did anybody tamper with the car?

21:13.564 --> 21:15.555
You know, that's what they're asking.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.064
Car's gone.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.566
All right?

21:19.612 --> 21:22.945
You stand by that report,
I will, too.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.231
Boyd's done right by me.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.865
Just tell him not to worry so much.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.987
(Gail) License plate number's
registered to a Shawn Elmore

21:32.041 --> 21:33.952
at this address.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.707
You sure this is the right address?

21:35.753 --> 21:38.961
It's 1663 Eastern.
I mean, and that's his car.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.667
Yeah, no, I recognize the place.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.001
It's a clubhouse.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.257
Which gang?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.588
JMC.
I mean, it's a small chapter.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.128
You know what?
I'm calling Frank.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.092
No,no,no,no.
You know who we need to call? Luke.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.134
(Luke) Okay, give me the highlights.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.927
(Dov) Accident report's bogus.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.062
The mechanic basically admitted
the car had been tampered with.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.974
Yeah, we went to the see the officer
who filed the report up at 34 Division,

22:00.027 --> 22:00.937
just like you said.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.897
— Okay.
— Well, she filed it,

22:02.947 --> 22:04.278
and they scrubbed it clean.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.312
They gave it back to her to sign.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.357
— Why?
— She didn't know,

22:07.409 --> 22:09.536
said we should talk to the detective
who gave the orders.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.079
Okay, then. Who gave the orders?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.037
Donovan Boyd.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.283
Who else have you told?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.122
No one. Just you.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.287
We ran the plates
from the original report.

22:21.340 --> 22:25.003
We found the guy. He's a biker.
His name is Shawn Elmore.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.418
— (Pete) Burgers and pho.
— Not now!

22:27.471 --> 22:29.803
Okay, Elmore's JMC,
a new patch, so——

22:29.849 --> 22:31.965
Sorry, sir, it's just that I know
you're working really hard on this case,

22:32.017 --> 22:35.134
and I'd hate for the food to get cold
before you had a chance to...

22:38.023 --> 22:40.685
Chopsticks are...in the bag.

22:43.070 --> 22:47.404
So Boyd has been making some
serious headway into the bikers.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.314
The guys in Gangs call him Kreskin.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.279
Who's Kreskin?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.580
He knows where. He knows when.
He knows who.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.408
Before it's even happening,
he knows what's happened.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.914
— So he's got an informant.
— Yeah, but he says no.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.370
He hasn't carded the guy.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.752
There's no statement,
so if he does, the guy's a ghost.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.503
(mouth full) Shawn Elmore.

23:03.549 --> 23:08.168
Okay, so why would a biker want
to kill Brennan's wife and child?

23:08.220 --> 23:09.926
This dead guy here is Matthew Elmore,

23:09.972 --> 23:11.883
Shawn's brother, okay?

23:11.932 --> 23:14.139
He had a beef with Brennan
probably over some turf.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.560
So why hit him back now?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.935
Because retaliation's
harder than you think,

23:17.980 --> 23:19.845
especially when you're dealing
with a pro like Brennan.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.854
You don't want to get caught.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.436
All right, what do we do?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.690
I don't know.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.476
You just stood up.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.939
I thought that meant
you knew what to do.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.697
Let's talk to him.
Let's bring him in.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.734
— On what charge?
— Uh, how about the murder

23:32.786 --> 23:33.992
of Maggie and Grace Brennan to start?

23:34.038 --> 23:35.027
— Peck, come on.
— All right.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.581
You're staying.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.704
It's already a big enough mess.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.990
I'm not gonna make it worse.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.875
(gasping and coughing)

23:44.924 --> 23:46.334
Look, nothing personal.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.999
I know you're just doing your job,
but... come on.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.338
Whatever you're making in overtime,

23:50.387 --> 23:51.467
it's not worth it.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.095
— Somebody rigged my car.
— (Sam gasping)

23:54.141 --> 23:55.301
Just give me a name.

23:55.351 --> 23:58.684
I know it's hard to accept
when accidents like that happen.

23:58.729 --> 24:01.311
Hey, wasn't an accident.
I know the difference.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.642
It didn't just happen.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.647
Even if that's true,
why would I know?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.149
'Cause you're working me!

24:07.446 --> 24:08.686
You're working undercover.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.024
You have access to everything about me.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.191
That report is the only thing I ever saw.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.905
If it was anything else,
I don't know about it.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.786
So you're trying to tell me
you're deep undercover,

24:17.831 --> 24:20.413
and your handler gave you
the same $12 report as I saw?

24:20.459 --> 24:24.452
Same guy who gave me a boat
seized in a high—profile drug raid.

24:24.505 --> 24:27.087
Believe me, he's not
my favorite person right now.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.793
Or maybe you're just a good cop,

24:28.842 --> 24:31.424
'cause you know I'm gonna
kill whoever you give up,

24:31.470 --> 24:34.132
so you're just gonna hold on
to that name as long as you can.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.344
I don't know who killed your family.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.220
Refill?

24:46.193 --> 24:47.478
Jamie!

24:53.450 --> 24:54.986
— Let's go.
— Okay, guys.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.866
— Later.
— See you later.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.823
Shawn Elmore?

24:58.872 --> 25:00.078
What could I do for ya?

25:01.375 --> 25:03.582
Want to talk to you
about Jamie Brennan.

25:03.627 --> 25:07.085
Sorry. Uh, I don't know
who that is.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.837
Really?

25:08.882 --> 25:11.259
Funny, considering you murdered
his wife and daughter.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.916
You know,
some new information's come up,

25:12.970 --> 25:15.131
and it seems the deal you made
with Donovan Boyd

25:15.180 --> 25:16.556
is about to expire.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.725
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.509
Okay, I guess, uh, we can just
talk to your boys back there,

25:21.562 --> 25:24.144
see if they know how you
got away with it for so long,

25:24.189 --> 25:27.181
oh, and how the Guns and Gangs Unit
seems to know so damn much

25:27.234 --> 25:28.815
about what you've been doing
the last little while.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.104
Yeah, that's what I thought.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.988
You pull Swarek into your mess,

25:39.038 --> 25:40.699
you give him an incomplete case file,

25:40.748 --> 25:42.363
and then you don't tell him the truth.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.202
Brennan's family
didn't die in an accident.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.366
They were murdered.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.327
You're covering for an informant——
Shawn Elmore, a biker.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.543
He tampers with Brennan's car,
and you cover it up for him.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.627
Now you own him,

25:52.676 --> 25:55.509
which is working out great
for you now, isn't it?

25:58.223 --> 25:59.884
You come up with this theory?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.548
'Cause I think it's amazing.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.092
Yeah, well, it works for me.

26:05.481 --> 26:08.268
God, you are noble.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.275
I mean, your girlfriend screws up,

26:11.320 --> 26:13.936
jumps into the sack
with another officer.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.195
She's not my girlfriend.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.447
Oops, sorry. Fiancee.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.656
She's a rookie, and right now
she's taking the fall for you.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.821
Well, I think
under these circumstances,

26:23.874 --> 26:25.705
you're talking out of your ass.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.327
I hope you're worth it.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.131
— Why isn't the Wi—Fi working?
— It's been iffy all day.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.047
It's fine. I'm tethering to my phone.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.556
I could have done that.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.387
— What's going on?
— (Traci) We got the why.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.597
Trying to figure out the where,
where would Brennan take Sam?

26:46.647 --> 26:49.104
Okay, so I'm Brennan.
I'm thinking maybe you have

26:49.149 --> 26:51.561
some information about my wife,
so I take you where?

26:51.610 --> 26:52.975
To, uh——To a motel

26:53.028 --> 26:55.565
or, uh, to my boathouse
or to my cabin.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.697
According to this, Brennan doesn't own
any properties besides his home.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.243
All right, fine.
So I take you to my——

27:00.285 --> 27:01.365
my mom's cabin
or my girlfriend's cabin.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.662
You have a girlfriend?

27:02.704 --> 27:04.490
No, I don't have a girlfriend. What...

27:04.540 --> 27:05.746
Wait. Wh—What was his wife's name?

27:05.791 --> 27:08.578
Maggie. Maggie Brennan, I guess.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.037
Uh, what's her maiden name?

27:10.087 --> 27:11.623
I don't know.

27:11.672 --> 27:14.539
Wilder. Margaret Wilder.

27:14.591 --> 27:17.583
Margaret. Maggie...

27:17.636 --> 27:19.718
Maggie Wilder.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.719
There's one property listed
under that name.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.629
It's in Pickering.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.390
27 acres on Century Road.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.847
I can't tell from this
if there's a house on it.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.433
I can. There is.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.276
We've got a lead.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.604
27 acres just north of the city.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.565
Property was listed
under the wife's maiden name.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.572
Go.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.154
Thank you.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.068
If they go alone,
they're gonna screw it up.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.997
Mm. If you go alone,
you'll screw it up.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.625
(coughing, gagging)

27:53.172 --> 27:54.787
You stand for something.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.172
You stand for somethin'.
I respect that.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.082
If you tell me who did it,

27:59.136 --> 28:01.377
he's gonna be the next person
in that chair.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.045
(coughs)

28:03.098 --> 28:04.759
And you're a cop.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.924
It's your job to protect people.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.762
I had a job, too.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.358
It was to take care
of my wife and child.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.403
This one's my favorite.

28:22.618 --> 28:26.110
I took this right after
Gracie said her first word.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.620
Maggie couldn't believe it.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.328
Just kept getting her to say it
over and over again.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.878
"Elda."

28:33.921 --> 28:35.036
Uaughs)

28:35.088 --> 28:37.079
"Elda, Elda, Elda."

28:40.344 --> 28:41.880
There she was——

28:41.929 --> 28:47.265
tiny, perfect little girl...

28:49.603 --> 28:51.514
saying a word.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.896
And I felt like no matter who I was
before that moment...

28:56.652 --> 28:58.688
l was her father.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.602
l was good at it.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.485
They're both innocent.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.785
Now they're dead.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.571
Whoever did this
doesn't deserve your protection.

29:10.624 --> 29:14.492
Jamie, I don't know who it was.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.000
No matter what you do to me,

29:16.046 --> 29:17.707
that's not gonna change.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.634
Elda.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.012
Uaughs)

29:27.057 --> 29:29.173
Dog's name was Zelda.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.887
That was her first word.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.267
(yells)

29:32.312 --> 29:34.894
Hope that's not your gun hand.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.807
(groaning and gasping)

29:37.859 --> 29:39.565
Huh?

29:39.611 --> 29:42.068
Second word...

29:42.114 --> 29:43.069
"Ottle."

29:43.115 --> 29:44.355
(groaning)

29:44.408 --> 29:45.944
"Bottle."

29:45.993 --> 29:48.234
Wasn't great at consonants.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.824
(screaming)

29:50.872 --> 29:51.827
Third word...

29:51.873 --> 29:53.784
O—Okay.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.995
(grunting)

29:56.044 --> 29:58.660
Okay. Okay.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.711
You think someone murdered your family.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.752
You think the police covered it up.
Maybe.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.471
You're gonna kill me anyway,

30:09.516 --> 30:11.097
so before that happens,
let's get really clear

30:11.143 --> 30:14.260
about who the bad guy is here.
You hurt a lot of people.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.725
If somebody messed with your life,

30:16.773 --> 30:18.354
you got no one to blame but yourself.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.812
I'm not gonna kill you any faster
if you piss me off.

30:20.861 --> 30:25.275
Let me help you narrow it down.
Vincent DeCarlo——

30:25.324 --> 30:27.280
family couldn't even ID the body.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.068
Matthew Elmore——biker.
So is his brother.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.202
Those guys never forget.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.956
Nora Wilson, she's the one
I was hoping to get you for.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.868
Security guard, single mother,
three little kids——

30:38.920 --> 30:40.751
You shot her in the head.

30:42.716 --> 30:46.379
Your wife and daughter didn't deserve
what happened to 'em,

30:46.428 --> 30:48.259
but it was only a matter of time,

30:48.305 --> 30:49.920
because you didn't deserve them.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.385
You think you've changed.
You haven't changed.

30:52.434 --> 30:53.389
Look at you.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.424
Uhh!

30:56.897 --> 30:59.479
(groans)

30:59.524 --> 31:01.355
(coughs)

31:21.213 --> 31:23.204
(sirens wailing)

31:26.343 --> 31:27.958
I didn't want to have to do this.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.647
Uaughs)

31:56.498 --> 31:57.908
— (bone crunch)
— (grunting)

31:59.501 --> 32:00.490
(metal clanks)

32:12.097 --> 32:13.212
(Oliver) I didn't see a car.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.505
Yeah. Maybe they're in there.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.014
Noelle, are you ready
to search the house?

32:16.059 --> 32:18.220
We'll start there.
Then we'll hit the barn.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.305
(Noelle on radio) We're ready.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.855
Durham guys are on their way.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.012
You want to wait?

32:22.065 --> 32:23.930
— Hell, no.
— Good. Epstein, Diaz,

32:23.984 --> 32:25.645
we're gonna take the front door.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.151
Nash, you're with Noelle.
You slide around back.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.356
Wait for my count.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.652
— You're not coming.
— Oliver.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.317
McNally, you're not coming.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.492
— (unholsters gun)
— Whoa, cadet, you stay here.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.708
You holster that weapon.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.745
Don't slam it.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.427
What happens now?

32:54.473 --> 32:55.713
We wait.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.218
(Sam) Aah!

33:02.272 --> 33:03.682
(punch lands, Sam cries out)

33:03.732 --> 33:05.347
(Oliver whispers) Stack up. Stack up.
Stay on me.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.435
They're not gonna do a knock.

33:06.485 --> 33:07.941
They're gonna kick it through.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.942
— What?
— Listen.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.149
Oliver's gonna count it off.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.986
— On three... two... one.
— (Andy) Three... two... one.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.741
(Andy) They're going
at the same time——

33:16.786 --> 33:19.323
both doors, front and back.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.919
If it's dark inside, then you
gotta use your flashlight.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.301
Flashlight, gun out——
it's tricky.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.429
Make sure you stay controlled.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.302
It's really hard to do.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.058
Your adrenaline is going.

33:43.605 --> 33:47.018
What you want to do is run in there
and fix everything.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.432
Can't do it like that.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.484
Keep it slow...

33:52.656 --> 33:54.146
no matter what might be happening.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.235
(whispers) Shut up. Shut up.

33:56.284 --> 34:00.368
Keep going throughout the house
and clear every single room.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.369
Go.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.701
Move up the stairs...

34:04.751 --> 34:07.083
which is a lot harder than you think.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.413
You better stay together.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.580
You're exposed.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.584
You don't know
what you're gonna find.

34:16.805 --> 34:19.171
You don't even know what you're
gonna do when you get there.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.340
(door bangs)

34:21.393 --> 34:23.224
See, that's the thing.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.261
It's different every time...

34:26.856 --> 34:28.596
so you better trust your instincts.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.690
You try to stay alive,

34:34.739 --> 34:37.071
try to keep others alive.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.108
(both grunting)

34:43.665 --> 34:45.451
What happens if you're too late?

34:49.296 --> 34:51.127
At least you know you did everything right.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.593
Let him go, Brennan!

34:58.638 --> 35:00.970
Let him go! You stay down.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.233
(Oliver) 1519.
Put a rush on the medics.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.523
We got an officer injured,
one in custody.

35:19.576 --> 35:22.318
(exhales)

35:22.370 --> 35:25.612
(Newton Faulkner)
J‘ Love, love is a verb J‘

35:25.665 --> 35:28.907
J‘ Love is a doing word J‘

35:28.960 --> 35:35.081
J‘ Fearless on my breath J‘

35:35.133 --> 35:38.296
J‘ Gentle impulsion J‘

35:38.345 --> 35:41.462
J‘ Shakes me, makes me lighter J‘

35:41.514 --> 35:48.010
J‘ Fearless on my breath J‘

35:48.063 --> 35:51.351
J‘ Teardrop on the fire J‘
(helicopter hovering)

35:51.399 --> 35:57.565
J‘ Fearless on my breath J‘

35:57.614 --> 36:00.947
J‘ Teardrop on the fire J‘

36:00.992 --> 36:13.996
J‘ Fearless on my breath J‘

36:14.047 --> 36:17.084
(vocalizing)

36:22.681 --> 36:32.773
J‘ You're stumbling in the dark J‘

36:32.816 --> 36:34.807
(vocalizing)

36:40.907 --> 36:43.319
(siren whoops)

36:43.368 --> 36:45.233
(Dov) So who do you think's
buying tonight?

36:45.286 --> 36:46.787
Swarek, man. We saved his ass.

36:46.830 --> 36:48.070
I don't know. Could be Oliver.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.159
Guy gets all emotional,
opens his wallet.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.368
Uaughs)

36:52.627 --> 36:54.163
You coming?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.292
Where?

36:55.338 --> 36:56.999
The Penny. You should.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.164
Sure.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.139
She'll be fine, okay?
She'll meet us there. Come on.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.310
Now that, that can't be good.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.065
Probably not.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.272
(Boyd) Sammy?

37:23.324 --> 37:26.157
(footsteps approach)

37:26.202 --> 37:27.783
Sam?

37:27.829 --> 37:29.239
(grunts) Yep?

37:30.331 --> 37:33.573
Ah. Glad you're back, man.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.708
I'm glad you're safe.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.416
We got Brennan.
He's in interview right now.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.207
Oh, yeah?
So why aren't you in there?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.500
He's your big fish. I would have
thought you'd be all over it.

37:43.553 --> 37:46.966
Well, you know, thought I'd let Jerry
handle it. He's earned it.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.506
Oh.
(door clanks shut)

37:51.102 --> 37:55.311
Don't even, okay? Because, look,
you and that rookie——

37:55.356 --> 37:59.190
Her name is Officer McNally,
and two years on the job,

37:59.235 --> 38:01.317
she's already ten times the cop
you'll ever be.

38:05.909 --> 38:06.989
You're done.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.571
Sammy, come——

38:14.459 --> 38:17.451
I'd be happy to talk...

38:17.504 --> 38:20.086
if, uh, you tell me what
you're gonna do about it first.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.247
(Jerry) Do about what?

38:23.551 --> 38:25.087
Two months ago,

38:25.136 --> 38:28.253
a mother and child were killed,

38:28.306 --> 38:31.594
murdered in a...car,

38:31.643 --> 38:34.601
and you guys still don't
seem that interested.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.932
I find that frustrating.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.767
We have someone in custody.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.442
Who?

38:46.491 --> 38:48.527
I can't tell you that,

38:48.576 --> 38:51.318
but I can tell you that the case
is officially reopened.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.284
Okay.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.295
I'll wait for the lawyer,
and then we'll get started.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.924
Tell your guy, uh, no hard feelings.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.755
He's a stand—up guy.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.593
(door closes)

39:14.727 --> 39:16.058
Sam.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.595
Boss.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.318
Glad we found you.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.864
Me, too.

39:29.492 --> 39:30.652
Come on, Frank. It's me.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.826
I know.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.658
That's the problem.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.916
Noelle, are you coming to the Penny?

39:40.962 --> 39:42.918
Yeah. Maybe I might see you there.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.704
(telephones ringing)

39:44.757 --> 39:46.008
Hey, Homicide.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.381
You coming or what?

39:47.427 --> 39:49.713
Yeah, uh, lwasn't
planning on it, no.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.504
Well, I need a ride,
so I will meet you out front.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.472
You're still here.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.061
Yep.

40:05.445 --> 40:06.776
How you doing?

40:06.821 --> 40:08.322
I've had better nights.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.439
Yep.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.698
Are you heading over
to the Black Penny?

40:12.744 --> 40:15.281
I can meet you there,
pick you up when I'm done.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.367
Nah, I don't think so.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.328
I mean, it's not like I can drink,
anyway, so...

40:21.377 --> 40:22.992
Why not? What do you mean?

40:24.756 --> 40:26.838
I'm pretty sure I'm pregnant.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.919
Pr—Pregnant? Wh——

40:28.968 --> 40:30.549
You were supposed
to start your lVF today.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.550
You didn't start that yet.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.427
Nope.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.257
(exhales)

40:46.444 --> 40:48.856
(sighs)

40:48.905 --> 40:50.145
(whispers) Yeah?

40:51.240 --> 40:53.447
— (laughs)
— Yeah?

40:53.493 --> 40:54.653
Yeah. Yeah.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.652
— Yeah?
— Yeah.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.570
Mm—hmm. (laughs)

40:59.624 --> 41:02.582
(Jay Malinowski's "We've All Got to Be
Going Somewhere" playing)

41:08.466 --> 41:09.626
I got soldiers.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.792
Uaughs)

41:11.844 --> 41:16.554
J‘ The city grows cold
as we start to fall J‘

41:16.599 --> 41:19.591
J‘ The streets are still lit J‘

J‘ The bars at last call J‘

41:22.063 --> 41:24.304
J‘ Looking for love J‘

41:24.357 --> 41:27.520
J‘ And looking for when J‘

41:27.568 --> 41:32.358
J‘ A final letter for me
will be sent J‘

41:32.407 --> 41:38.494
J‘ 'Cause we've all got
to be going somewhere J‘

41:39.497 --> 41:40.737
Hey.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.537
What happened?

41:49.590 --> 41:52.627
— Got suspended. You?
— J‘ I've got my freedom J‘

41:52.677 --> 41:54.213
J‘ I've got my friends J‘

41:54.262 --> 41:56.378
J‘ I've got stories... J‘

41:56.431 --> 41:57.762
I got yelled at,

41:57.807 --> 41:59.388
and then I got suspended.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.846
— J‘ Stories that go... J‘
