00:00.660 --> 00:03.663
[***]

00:12.340 --> 00:13.307
SHAWN.

00:13.340 --> 00:15.069
STOP.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.071
TURN AROUND.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.646
TURN AROUND.
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?

00:27.090 --> 00:28.455
DID YOU GET IN A FIGHT, SHAWN?

00:28.490 --> 00:29.718
KIN DA.
"KINDA"?

00:29.760 --> 00:30.829
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "KINDA"?

00:30.860 --> 00:31.781
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT FIGHTING?

00:31.830 --> 00:33.695
GET OVER HERE, SON.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.595
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.830
YOU REALLY GOT PUNCHED.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.838
HOLD THAT ON YOUR EYE.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.565
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME...

00:44.610 --> 00:45.838
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS KID
WHO HIT YOU?

00:45.870 --> 00:47.098
ELIZABETH.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.645
YOU GOT IN A FIGHT
WITH A GIRL?

00:49.680 --> 00:50.704
IT WASN'T REALLY A FIGHT.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.240
SHE JUST PUNCHED ME.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.713
WELL, WHY IN THE WORLD
WOULD SHE PUNCH YOU?

00:53.750 --> 00:55.115
WHAT... WHAT HAPPENED?

00:55.150 --> 00:56.708
SHE ASKED ME
TO SIT NEXT TO HER AT LUNCH,

00:56.750 --> 00:58.388
AND I DID,

00:58.420 --> 00:59.785
AND THEN I WAS EATING
MY TATER TOTS,

00:59.820 --> 01:01.310
THEN SHE JUST PUNCHED ME.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.725
WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.682
WHAT WAS SHE DOING

01:04.730 --> 01:06.254
WHILE YOU WERE EATING
YOUR TATER TOTS?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.551
I DON'T KNOW.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.692
SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.368
WHAT?
WHAT WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

01:10.400 --> 01:11.594
I HAVE NO IDEA.

01:11.630 --> 01:12.767
SHE JUST WENT ON AND ON,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.530
AND I WAS CONCENTRATING
ON MY TATER TOTS.

01:15.570 --> 01:17.106
[CHUCKLING]:
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.539
SHAWN, I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.878
YOU JUST HAD YOUR FIRST DATE.

01:19.910 --> 01:20.877
SIT.
FI RST--

01:20.910 --> 01:22.741
SIT.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.748
MY FIRST WHAT?

01:24.780 --> 01:26.748
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY,
THIS ELIZABETH GIRL LIKES YOU.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.748
THAT'S WHY SHE INVITED YOU OVER
TO SIT NEXT TO HER.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.714
THEN WHY DID SHE SOCK ME
IN THE EYE?

01:30.750 --> 01:31.580
BECAUSE SHE LIKES YOU,

01:31.620 --> 01:32.518
AND YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
TO HER STORY.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.710
WOMEN WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO THEM, SHAWN.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.627
THEY WANT YOU TO PICK UP
EVERY SMALL DETAIL,

01:37.660 --> 01:38.786
AND THEY WANT YOU
TO COMPLIMENT THEM.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.229
IT'S ABOUT
TUNING IN TO PEOPLE.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.625
IT'S ABOUT
GETTING INSIDE THEIR HEADS

01:41.660 --> 01:43.127
AND ANTICIPATING THEIR NEEDS,

01:43.170 --> 01:44.728
AND THIS APPLIES
TO ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE--

01:44.770 --> 01:45.862
NOT ONLY THIS GIRL,
ELIZABETH,

01:45.900 --> 01:47.697
BUT...EVEN YOUR BARBER.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.765
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO DATE THE BARBER.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.232
SHAWN, I KNOW THAT ONE DAY

01:51.270 --> 01:52.737
ALL OF THIS
IS GOING TO MAKE SENSE TO YOU.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.736
YOU JUST HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

01:54.780 --> 01:55.701
BUT FOR NOW,

01:55.740 --> 01:56.843
I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU

01:56.880 --> 01:58.848
WITH ONE
VERY SIMPLE RULE--

01:58.880 --> 02:01.678
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, EVER...

02:01.720 --> 02:03.847
EVER DO YOU MENTION
TO A WOMAN

02:03.890 --> 02:06.711
HER AGE OR HER WEIGHT.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.715
NOBODY BREATHE.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.715
I'VE GOT IT.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.727
I'VE GOT IT IN GRAMS.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.852
I'VE GOT IT IN MINUTES.

02:10.890 --> 02:13.723
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND HERE
TO DO A LITTLE CONVERTING.

02:17.870 --> 02:19.690
I GOT IT.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.799
37 YEARS OLD.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.501
127 POUNDS.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.698
THAT WAS AMAZING.

02:27.740 --> 02:28.707
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

02:28.740 --> 02:30.298
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

02:30.350 --> 02:31.772
I HAVE TO ADMIT, THOUGH,
SADLY,

02:31.810 --> 02:33.277
IT'S JUST A TEENSY BIT HIGHER
IN THE WEIGHT DEPARTMENT.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.878
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S MY BAD.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.785
I BELIEVE I WAS GETTING
A "FUTURE READING"

02:36.820 --> 02:37.844
FROM NEXT WEEK.

02:37.890 --> 02:39.448
IT HAPPENS.
I APOLOGIZE.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.718
WAIT. . .

02:40.760 --> 02:41.852
I'M ALSO GETTING
A DANCE BELT...

02:41.890 --> 02:43.289
YOU ARE MY
HEAD DETECTIVE.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.252
[SHAWN]: AND
FISHNET STOCKINGS.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.791
BUT THAT'S THIS GUY.

02:46.830 --> 02:47.899
THAT'S THIS GUY HERE.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.466
[LAUGHING]

02:49.500 --> 02:50.467
SHAWN. SHAWN.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.489
YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD SPORT--

02:51.530 --> 02:52.838
HEY, SPENCER...

02:52.870 --> 02:54.735
LASSIE-FACE!

02:56.470 --> 02:57.732
I'VE GOT
THE PERFECT CASE

02:57.770 --> 02:59.977
FOR YOU GUYS.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.568
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU WANT OUR HELP?

03:01.610 --> 03:02.747
YEAH.
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

03:02.780 --> 03:03.747
THERE'S
NO CATCH.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.701
IT'S JUST RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.308
I COULD REALLY USE YOUR INSIGHTS
ON THIS ONE.

03:06.350 --> 03:08.375
GUY'S WAITING TO
GIVE YOU A STATEMENT.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.388
INTERROGATION ROOM "B."

03:10.420 --> 03:11.739
MAKE ME PROUD.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.818
OKAY...

03:15.860 --> 03:17.623
WHAT DOES THAT
SOUND LIKE TO YOU?

03:17.660 --> 03:19.628
OPPORTUNITY.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.695
NO.

03:20.730 --> 03:21.492
YOU THINK LASSITER

03:21.530 --> 03:23.327
IS GOING TO JUST
HAND US OVER A CASE?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.723
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A MINUTE.

03:24.770 --> 03:25.498
GUS, COME ON.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.566
WE'RE GOING TO
ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES,

03:27.600 --> 03:28.669
WE'RE GOING TO GET
A LITTLE BIT DIRTY,

03:28.700 --> 03:29.803
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO

03:29.840 --> 03:30.807
SOME OLD-FASHIONED
POLICE WORK.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.704
COME ON, THIS IS LIKE

03:31.740 --> 03:32.399
IN THE HEAT
OF THE NIGHT,

03:32.440 --> 03:34.704
WHICH MAKES ME CARROLL O'CONNOR.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.968
NO, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE ROD STEIGER.

03:36.010 --> 03:37.841
THAT WAY, I'M SIDNEY POITIER.

03:37.880 --> 03:38.904
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.745
OH! BOY...

03:42.790 --> 03:44.519
WOW.

03:44.550 --> 03:45.744
[SHAWN]: LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY BEAT US

03:45.790 --> 03:46.711
TO THE ROLLING UP
THE SLEEVES.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.909
NO.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.915
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT?

03:50.530 --> 03:51.758
[WHISPERING]:
THIS IS OUR CASE.

03:51.790 --> 03:52.791
[WHISPERING]:
HE'S NAKED.

03:52.830 --> 03:53.626
WE'VE GOT TO
WORK THE ROOM.

03:53.660 --> 03:54.854
I'M GOING TO WORK IT
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.390
WORK IT
FROM IN HERE.

03:56.430 --> 03:57.897
NOW, SHUT THE DOOR.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.703
[FULL VOICE]: MR...

04:04.740 --> 04:05.809
TU RK, IS IT?

04:05.840 --> 04:07.728
MY NAME'S SHAWN SPENCER.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.578
I'M THE HEAD "P"
FOR THE SBPD.

04:10.610 --> 04:12.475
YOU'RE THE WHO FOR THE WHAT?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.772
DON'T CONCERN YOURSELF
WITH FORMALITIES, MR. TURK.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.718
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOUR STATEMENT,

04:15.750 --> 04:17.342
FIND OUT JUST WHAT EXACTLY
HAPPENED TO YOU.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.779
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
REMEMBER MUCH.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.048
FUNNY...

04:21.090 --> 04:22.785
IT SAYS HERE
YOU TOLD THE DESK SERGEANT

04:24.530 --> 04:25.883
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:25.930 --> 04:28.819
I MEAN, I DON'T REMEMBER
EXACTLY WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.590
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL REALLY
CONFUSING FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.689
WHEN YOU SAY "THEY,"
WHO ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

04:33.740 --> 04:34.764
THE ALIENS.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.002
[GUS]: SEE?

04:46.680 --> 04:47.817
RIGHT, ALIENS.
HERE IT IS.

04:47.850 --> 04:48.748
PAGE TWO. GOT IT.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.917
HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE

04:49.950 --> 04:50.689
THESE ALIENS,
MR. TURK?

04:50.720 --> 04:51.812
WOULD YOU SAY
THEY WERE SMALL?

04:51.850 --> 04:52.885
WOULD YOU SAY
THEY WERE GREEN?

04:52.920 --> 04:55.809
I-I DON'T REALLY RECALL
RIGHT NOW.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.589
I'VE GOT THIS HEADACHE, AND...

04:57.630 --> 04:59.086
WHO IS THAT PERSON OVER THERE?

04:59.130 --> 05:00.893
BECAUSE HE'S REALLY
MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

05:00.930 --> 05:03.091
I'M MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE
RIGHT NOW?

05:03.130 --> 05:04.961
DUDE, IS THERE ANY REASON WHY
YOU'RE NOT WEARING CLOTHES NOW?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.763
HEY, I THINK
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED,

05:06.800 --> 05:08.631
ALL RIGHT?

05:08.670 --> 05:09.932
I BELIEVE I MIGHT'VE
BEEN EXPERIMENTED ON,

05:09.970 --> 05:11.107
SO THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GOING TO TOUCH THESE CLOTHES

05:11.140 --> 05:12.061
AND COMPROMISE
EVIDENCE!

05:12.110 --> 05:13.737
OKAY, OKAY, MR. TURK.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.678
PLEASE, TRY
TO GAIN CONTROL

05:14.710 --> 05:15.529
OF YOUR
CONSIDERABLE PERSON.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.877
WHY DON'T YOU COVER UP
WITH A TOWEL.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.343
THAT'S WHY IT'S THERE.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.348
ONE SIZE FITS ALL...
I HOPE.

05:25.090 --> 05:26.489
ALL RIGHT.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.680
I'LL COVER UP WITH THE TOWEL,

05:27.720 --> 05:29.426
BUT FIRST...

05:29.460 --> 05:31.758
DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO CHECK ME
FOR SCARS?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.348
OH, GOOD LORD!

05:33.400 --> 05:34.719
AAH!

05:34.760 --> 05:38.366

05:38.400 --> 05:42.666
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

05:42.710 --> 05:45.065
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

05:45.110 --> 05:46.805
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

05:46.840 --> 05:48.831
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

05:48.880 --> 05:50.700
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

05:50.750 --> 05:52.843
* THEY WILL PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END **

05:59.820 --> 06:01.412
[GUS]: ARE YOU REALLY WILLING
TO JUST DISMISS THE IDEA

06:01.460 --> 06:02.427
THAT THERE'S LIFE
ON OTHER PLANETS?

06:02.460 --> 06:03.119
THIS IS WHAT I'VE GOT.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.855
I KNOW HE WAS DRAGGED OUT THERE.

06:04.890 --> 06:05.857
OTHERWISE,
NO SIGN OF ASSAULT,

06:05.890 --> 06:06.857
NOTHING TAKEN...

06:06.900 --> 06:07.798
ASIDE FROM
THE EMBARRASSMENT

06:07.830 --> 06:08.694
OF WAKING UP NAKED
IN A FIELD,

06:08.730 --> 06:10.698
WE'VE GOT NOTHING
TO HANG OUR HATS ON.

06:13.140 --> 06:13.936
I GUESS TECHNICALLY

06:13.970 --> 06:15.130
WE COULD HAVE
HUNG OUR HATS ON IT.

06:15.170 --> 06:15.966
SHAWN.
SURE.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.434
LOOK, IF IT'S NOT THE ALIEN
THING,

06:18.470 --> 06:19.778
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

06:19.810 --> 06:21.175
THE MEMORY LOSS,
THE CONFUSION,

06:21.210 --> 06:22.177
THE FACT THAT HE SAW
A LITTLE GREEN MAN?

06:22.210 --> 06:23.006
HALLUCINATIONS.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.074
NO.
WHAT?

06:24.110 --> 06:25.668
DUDE, YOU'RE
THE EXPERT HERE.

06:25.710 --> 06:26.813
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME DRUG

06:26.850 --> 06:28.078
THAT WOULD CAUSE
A COMBINATION

06:28.120 --> 06:28.973
OF THOSE
THREE THINGS.

06:29.020 --> 06:29.748
THINK.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.711
DRUGS!

06:30.750 --> 06:31.978
OH, YOU'RE ASKING ME?

06:32.020 --> 06:32.952
SURE.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.878
WELL...

06:34.920 --> 06:35.887
LET ME SEE.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.888
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD,

06:37.930 --> 06:39.727
ANY SSRIs,

06:39.760 --> 06:43.526
TRAMADOL, BUPROPION,
PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS...

06:43.570 --> 06:44.594
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

06:44.630 --> 06:45.597
THANK YOU.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.097
VENLAFAXINE, ROPINIROLE...

06:54.880 --> 06:55.938
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP,
ARE YOU?

06:55.980 --> 06:57.800
DID I ALREADY SAY VENLAFAXINE?

06:57.850 --> 06:58.145
THERE'S NO WAY TO BE SURE.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.339
WAIT A SECOND.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.848
DIDN'T HE SAY SOMETHING TO YOU
ABOUT...

07:03.890 --> 07:04.914
ABOUT SMELLING LAVENDER?

07:04.950 --> 07:06.178
HE SAID
RIGHT BEFORE HE BLACKED OUT,

07:06.220 --> 07:07.778
HE REMEMBERED THE STRONG SCENT
OF LAVENDER

07:07.820 --> 07:09.458
AND SEEING, UH...

07:09.490 --> 07:10.457
BARBED WIRE.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.185
RIGHT.
WAIT A SECOND.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.697
GUS, THAT'S NOT
A HALLUCINATION.

07:13.730 --> 07:14.924
THAT'S A LOCATION.

07:14.960 --> 07:15.619
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

07:15.660 --> 07:16.820
AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS.

07:18.770 --> 07:22.069
[SHAWN]: DUDE, I'VE DRIVEN BY
THIS PLACE AT LEAST TWICE.

07:22.100 --> 07:26.002
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE
THE COPS DOING HERE?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.475
JOHNNY.

07:33.520 --> 07:33.849
OH.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.478

07:52.300 --> 07:54.063
LOOK, I SAW THE PICTURE
OF THAT TURK GUY

07:54.100 --> 07:55.590
IN THE PAPER.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.629
NOW IT'S ME IN A FIELD NAKED?

07:56.670 --> 07:57.762

07:57.810 --> 07:58.868

SEEING ANYTHING

07:58.910 --> 08:00.104

08:00.140 --> 08:01.698
UH...

08:01.740 --> 08:02.809
I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH AT ALL.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.272
SO YOU JUST
WOKE UP IN A FIELD

08:04.310 --> 08:06.141
WEARING NOTHING
BUT YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.613
LOOK, I TOLD YOU YES
ALREADY.

08:07.650 --> 08:08.548
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME
A HARD TIME?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.116
'CAUSE I'M A LITTLE FREAKED OUT
AS IT IS.

08:10.150 --> 08:11.708
AND CAN SOMEBODY
GET ME A BIGGER TOWEL?

08:11.750 --> 08:13.889
THIS THING IS LIKE THE SIZE
OF A WASH CLOTH.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.750
[CAMERA CLICKS]

08:14.790 --> 08:15.688
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF PERVERT?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.779
CUT HIM SOME SLACK.
HE'S JUST DOING HIS JOB.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.286
YOU THINK HE GETS
HIS JOLLIES

08:19.330 --> 08:21.548
TAKING PICTURES
OF YOUR DING-DONG?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.567
LASSIE!

08:22.600 --> 08:23.897
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

08:23.930 --> 08:24.897
THIS IS MY CASE.

08:24.930 --> 08:26.864
YOU GAVE IT TO ME, REMEMBER?

08:26.900 --> 08:28.299
LOOK, IT'S A COPYCAT, OKAY?

08:28.340 --> 08:29.898
HE SAW TURK'S PICTURE
IN THE PAPER.

08:29.940 --> 08:30.861
HE'S LOOKING FOR ATTENTION.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.161
SO HE WAKES UP
AND SEES TURK IN THE PAPER,

08:32.210 --> 08:33.074
NAKED, HUMILIATED,

08:33.110 --> 08:34.304
THE BUTT OF JOKES
AT THE WATER COOLER,

08:34.340 --> 08:36.103
AND SAYS, "HMM.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.903
HOW CAN I MAKE THIS WORK
FOR MYSELF?" WHAT?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.941
PLUS, IT'S REALLY
ITCHY OUT HERE.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.641
WHEN YOU GET YOUR
MASTER'S DEGREE IN CRIMINOLOGY,

08:41.680 --> 08:42.783
THEN YOU CAN CALL ME.

08:42.820 --> 08:44.139
IN THE MEANTIME,

08:44.190 --> 08:45.885
I'VE GOT A HALF-EATEN ENCHIRITO
IN MY CAR.

08:50.790 --> 08:51.927
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
YOU'RE UP.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.927

08:52.960 --> 08:53.927
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.188
DUDE...

08:55.230 --> 08:56.254
I TOOK THE FAT GUY
IN THE POLICE STATION.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.665
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

08:57.700 --> 08:58.769
THIS IS A MUCH BETTER--

08:58.800 --> 09:00.028
WE'RE PARTNERS.

09:00.070 --> 09:00.536

09:07.240 --> 09:08.207

09:08.240 --> 09:09.798
WITH A TANNING SALON?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.306
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF WINTER
IN SANTA BARBARA.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.169
THOSE DUDES LOOKED
LIKE GINGERBREAD MEN,

09:12.210 --> 09:13.177
WITHOUT TAN LINES.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.676
THEY FAKE AND THEY BAKE.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.869
SHAWN, EXACTLY
HOW CLOSELY

09:15.920 --> 09:16.887
DID YOU LOOK
AT THESE NAKED GUYS?

09:16.920 --> 09:17.989
TOO CLOSE.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.044
MY HEIGHTENED
OBSERVATIONAL SKILLS

09:19.090 --> 09:20.717
ARE CONSIDERED A GIFT BY MOST,

09:20.760 --> 09:22.182
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
IT CAN BE A BURDEN.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.118
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S THIS PLACE?

09:25.960 --> 09:27.757
KEISER DIDN'T HAVE ANY
STREAKS ON HIS BUTTOCKS,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.199
OKAY?

09:29.230 --> 09:30.788
THAT SCREAMS
THE INSTA-TAN PROCESS,

09:30.830 --> 09:32.263
AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
THAT DOES THAT.

09:32.300 --> 09:32.732
RIGHT.

09:34.870 --> 09:36.030
PLUS, THEY BOTH LIVE

09:36.070 --> 09:37.207
WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF
OF THIS JOINT.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.662

09:47.920 --> 09:49.842
YOU FIND OUT IF TURK OR KEISER
WERE HERE,

09:49.890 --> 09:51.118
AND IF SO, WHEN.

09:51.150 --> 09:51.844
OH, SHAWN, SHAWN.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.753
THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK.

09:54.790 --> 09:55.882
DUDE, I'VE GOT TO DO MY THING.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.126
I'VE GOT TO MIX IT UP NICE.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.286
BUT--
YOU ALWAYS COM PLAIN

09:58.330 --> 09:59.797
YOU DON'T GET TO DO
THE QUESTIONY PART.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.627

10:01.660 --> 10:02.763

10:09.070 --> 10:10.833
I'M HERE
FOR A TANNING APPOINTMENT.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.804
FOR YOURSELF?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.137
YES, FOR THE...
INSTA-TAN PROCESS.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.204
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.343
BUT...

10:17.380 --> 10:18.677

10:18.710 --> 10:20.211
WELL, YOU'RE...
YES.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.979
UH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.182
OKAY, LOOK, SCREW IT.
I CAN'T DO IT.

10:25.220 --> 10:26.187
HAVE YOU SEEN EITHER
OF THESE TWO GUYS

10:26.220 --> 10:27.289
HERE BEFORE?

10:27.320 --> 10:30.027

OR PHILIP KEISER?

10:30.060 --> 10:32.153
SHAWN. SHAWN.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.896
OKAY, BOTH

10:33.930 --> 10:34.851
NOT ONLY
HAVE BEEN HERE,

10:34.900 --> 10:35.958
BUT THEY'RE REGULARS.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.228
HE SAYS IT'S ALWAYS
THE SINGLE GUYS

10:37.270 --> 10:38.692
WHO TRY TO KEEP UP
WITH THEIR TANS.

10:38.730 --> 10:39.731
SINGLE GUYS.
YEAH.

10:39.770 --> 10:40.737
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

10:40.770 --> 10:41.896
MAYBE SOME WOMAN

10:41.940 --> 10:43.100
IS TARGETING SINGLES
AT THE SALON.

10:43.140 --> 10:43.959
THE QUESTION IS,

10:44.010 --> 10:45.830
WHAT KIND OF A LOSER
THINKS GETTING A TAN

10:45.870 --> 10:46.700
IS GOING TO HELP HIM
SCORE A WOMAN?

10:52.880 --> 10:53.869

10:58.720 --> 10:59.687

DOING HERE?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.813
THE REAL QUESTION IS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:01.860 --> 11:04.078
WELL, GEORGE HAMILTON,
WE'RE ON A CASE...

11:04.130 --> 11:05.859
OR MAYBE YOU MISSED
THE PICTURES

11:05.890 --> 11:07.949
OF THE GUYS IN THE PAPER
IN THE FIELDS...

11:08.000 --> 11:09.865
YES, OF COURSE
I SAW THE NUDISTS.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.765
GUY IN THE FIELD THINKS
HE WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.698
IDIOT.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.162
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH THIS PLACE?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.963
WELL, THEY'RE BOTH
REGULARS HERE.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.001
THEY BOTH HAPPEN TO BE SINGLE,

11:17.040 --> 11:18.132
SO THIS COULD BE
A STALKING CASE.

11:18.170 --> 11:18.909
WAIT A SECOND.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.237
YOUR DAD IS SINGLE,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.770
AND HE COMES HERE
ALL THE TIME.

11:21.810 --> 11:22.799

11:30.420 --> 11:31.739
ALL I KNOW IS
WHEN I VARNISH MY BOAT

11:31.790 --> 11:32.814
AND I DON'T WANT IT TO STREAK,

11:32.860 --> 11:33.952
I SAND OFF A LAYER FIRST.

11:33.990 --> 11:35.753
SAME THING GOES WITH TANNING.

11:35.790 --> 11:36.609
THAT IS THE SINGLE
MOST DISTURBING ANALOGY

11:36.660 --> 11:38.753
I HAVE EVER HEARD

11:43.830 --> 11:44.922
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?

11:44.970 --> 11:45.595

11:47.300 --> 11:48.437
AND THE GUY WITH THE GLASSES.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.804
YOUR REAL PROBLEM IS?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.239
YOU GOT YOURSELF ANOTHER CASE,

11:56.280 --> 11:57.872
AND, AS USUAL,
YOU'RE SHORT-SIGHTED.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.172
YOU THINK
IT'S ALL IMPRESSIVE,

11:59.210 --> 12:00.939
'CAUSE YOU SEE A COUPLE
OF NUDE GUYS IN A FIELD,

12:00.980 --> 12:01.776

ARE TRYING TO IMPRESS SOMEONE,

12:05.820 --> 12:07.082
WHICH MEANS
A WOMAN WAS INVOLVED,

12:07.120 --> 12:10.089
AND THAT SAME WOMAN
WAS WITH THEM IN THE FIELD.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.154

12:14.960 --> 12:16.097

12:16.130 --> 12:20.260
WELL, YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
CLOSE ENOUGH.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.803
BELIEVE ME, I'VE LOOKED
JUST ABOUT AS CLOSE

I THINK YOUR DAD MIGHT BE RIGHT.

12:34.020 --> 12:34.839

GET TURK AND KEISER

12:34.880 --> 12:35.710
IN THE SAME ROOM

12:35.750 --> 12:36.842
AND ACTUALLY ASK THEM

YOU GOT THE MESSAGE.

35:52.610 --> 35:53.679
IT'S NOT DARCY.
YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR.

35:53.710 --> 35:54.813
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY,
SHAWN.

35:54.850 --> 35:56.169
YOU ARE GOING TO PAY.
BELIEVE ME.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.118
NO OFFENSE,

35:57.150 --> 35:58.378
BUT IT'S TOUGH TO FEEL
THREATENED BY YOU

35:58.420 --> 35:59.216
WHEN YOU'RE WEARING
THAT SHIRT.

35:59.250 --> 36:00.717
IS THAT A HIBISCUS?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.286
IT'S NOT MY SHIRT, SHAWN.
IT'S YOUR DAD'S SHIRT.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.309
HE HAD TO LOAN ME ONE.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.850
MINE WAS COVERED IN SNOT TEARS.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.323
I CAN'T--

36:06.360 --> 36:07.850
DID YOU KNOW
HE ALSO TAKES BUBBLE BATHS?

36:07.890 --> 36:08.720
SO DID JOHN WAYNE.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.591
I KNOW,
BUT CAN YOU NAME ONE OTHER GUY?

36:10.630 --> 36:11.494
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:11.530 --> 36:12.724
I SOLVED THE CASE.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.260
IT'S ACTUALLY GOT
A DECENT TWIST.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.463

36:17.500 --> 36:20.298
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF
AN ADVENTURIST, YOU KNOW?

36:20.340 --> 36:21.637
I WAS CAUGHT
IN AN AVALANCHE ONCE.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.738
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE,

36:22.780 --> 36:23.838
I DRANK MY OWN URINE

36:23.880 --> 36:25.677
AND I ATE
THREE OF MY TOES,

36:25.710 --> 36:27.701
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,

36:27.750 --> 36:28.671
MAYBE WHY YOU SAW ME
LIMP WHEN I CAME IN.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.846
HEY, BIG GUY.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.381
MIND IF I CUT IN HERE?

36:31.420 --> 36:32.717
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE KIND OF IN A...

36:32.750 --> 36:33.819
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

36:33.850 --> 36:36.250
OKAY.

36:36.290 --> 36:37.689
GEE, I REALLY HOPE
THAT WASN'T RUDE.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.880
IT SEEMED A LITTLE RUDE.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.488
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I SHOULD THANK YOU,

36:40.530 --> 36:41.690

36:41.730 --> 36:44.324
THAT IS
A VERY NICE NAME.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.705
SO, NAW BLUE
IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?

36:53.740 --> 36:54.832
MINE'S GREEN.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.370
YOU KNOW,
YOU SEEM EUROPEAN.

36:56.410 --> 36:58.378
YOU SURE YOU DON'T HAVE
FAMILY HISTORY THERE?

36:58.410 --> 37:00.275
WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER'S
MAIDEN NAME?

37:00.310 --> 37:01.868
SO AFTER VOLUNTEERING
FOR THE ANIMAL SHELTER,

37:01.920 --> 37:02.944
I DECIDED--

37:02.980 --> 37:03.947
CAN I STOP YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

37:03.980 --> 37:04.947
MM-HMM.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.412
I'M SO SORRY.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.315
I'M SO SORRY.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.019
UH, EVERYBODY?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.357
I'M SORRY.

37:10.390 --> 37:10.958
IF I COULD JUST
GET YOUR ATTENTION

37:10.990 --> 37:11.957
FOR A SEC HERE.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.857
I'M SORRY.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.595
I WANT TO PICK THIS UP
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF

37:16.630 --> 37:17.892
IF THERE'S ANY TIME LEFT
ON THE CLOCK, OKAY?

37:17.930 --> 37:19.022
BECAUSE YOU SEEM LIKE
A TERRIFIC PERSON.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.162
YOU DESERVE
SOMEONE SPECIAL,

37:20.200 --> 37:23.260
SOMEONE WHO MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE,
BUT ALSO A LITTLE DIRTY.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.699
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

37:24.740 --> 37:26.002

37:30.010 --> 37:31.272
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE.

37:31.310 --> 37:32.106
BUT THE POINT IS,
YOU'RE HERE,

37:32.150 --> 37:33.777
AND YOU PUT YOUR HEARTS
ON THE LINE,

37:33.810 --> 37:35.368
AND THAT'S ALL
THAT REALLY MATTERS.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.944
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE HERE

37:36.980 --> 37:39.517
THAT DO NOT SHARE
YOUR PURE DESIRES.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.814
THEY'RE NOT HERE TO
FIND THEIR SOULMATES.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.987
THEY'RE NOT HERE
TO FALL IN LOVE.

THEY'RE NOT EVEN SINGLE.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.495

BUT A COUPLE.

WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

38:07.350 --> 38:08.317
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.339
NOW, THE QUESTION

38:09.380 --> 38:10.369
IS WHY WOULD A MARRIED COUPLE

38:10.420 --> 38:12.047
INFILTRATE
A SINGLES EVENT?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.443

IS SIMPLE.

THE WORST OF IT.

THE WORST OF IT

39:28.660 --> 39:32.118
IS THAT YOU TWO
STOLE A VERY VALUABLE SEAT

BECAUSE YOU LIKE THEM,

I SEE.

40:52.510 --> 40:55.115
BUT LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
I SAT DOWN
