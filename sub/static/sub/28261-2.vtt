23:50.012 --> 23:52.890
Why leave the FBI
to become a school cop?

23:52.890 --> 23:54.933
Well, it's not just
any school. This is BHU.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.228
And if Mrs. Hotchkiss
empowered her to do

23:58.228 --> 24:00.064
whatever it takes
to find Nolan's killer

24:00.064 --> 24:02.816
she's going to get off
on bending all the rules.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.234
'None of us are safe.'

24:04.234 --> 24:06.153
'She'll use whatever she can
against us.'

24:06.153 --> 24:09.073
- 'You mean our secrets?'
- Great.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.824
(Caitlin)
'Yeah, she'll have
access to everything.'

24:10.824 --> 24:13.535
Nolan's phone. His computer.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.288
I really hope our secrets
had died with Nolan.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.539
Nolan was smart, alright?

24:17.539 --> 24:18.707
He wouldn't make it easy
for his mom

24:18.707 --> 24:20.000
to find out that he was..

24:20.000 --> 24:21.877
...blackmailing people.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.838
I know where he
kept his weed.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.132
Maybe that's where he kept
the stash of your secrets.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.636
We could break away
from the wake tonight.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.054
Look in the green house
where Claire

24:32.054 --> 24:33.764
used to grow her roses
with Taylor.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.265
'She doesn't really
go there anymore.'

24:35.265 --> 24:37.351
It's behind a broken
cinder block.

24:37.351 --> 24:39.853
Uh, Ava, you're not
coming with us?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.480
Well, they're your secrets.
Not mine.

24:46.652 --> 24:51.573
[sighs]
Why me? I mean,
why would Nolan trust me?

24:51.573 --> 24:54.159
Well, you said it yourself.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.536
You came here
to help these kids

24:55.536 --> 24:58.288
and he believed you.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.541
Or somebody's trying to frame me
for his murder.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.084
Well, that is a possibility.

25:03.961 --> 25:07.089
- Wanna stay for pie?
- No, Mona, uh..

25:07.089 --> 25:09.591
Classes resume tomorrow
and in spite of everything

25:09.591 --> 25:11.218
I really need to be prepared.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.470
Oh. Yeah.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.306
- Are you going to be okay?
- Sure. Why wouldn't I be?

25:16.306 --> 25:19.393
I know in the past we've been
more frenemies than friends.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.729
But...I want you to know
that I--

25:21.729 --> 25:24.398
Are you trying to say
that you care about me?

25:24.398 --> 25:26.567
[chuckles]
Sort of.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.695
I know how easy it is
for you to go down

25:29.695 --> 25:31.572
the rabbit hole
and not come back.

25:31.572 --> 25:36.493
So, I need you to stay connected
to reality and to people.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.791

I could ever ask for.

That's great.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.509
I don't know.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.052
It's an anonymous game I play

25:54.052 --> 25:55.888
through an online campus
chess club.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.642
I'd offer to play with you
in person, but--

26:00.642 --> 26:03.103
You'd lose.

I was being buried alive

Grief and food go together

26:42.142 --> 26:44.561
You should read, "Death Warmed
Over" by Lisa Rogak.

It's a great book
about funeral foods

26:46.772 --> 26:48.982

from around the world.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.236

on my summer reading list.

for a little bit?

No, not as two people who dated.

He found a way to push us
all to our limits.

I mean, that wasn't
always a good thing.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.210
When we were together
you didn't seem thrilled

27:50.210 --> 27:51.712
to be his number two.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.589
Yeah, Nolan was always
going to be number one

I'm getting drunk
in your living room, Alison.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.506
You can call me Claire.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.467
Drink?

35:38.720 --> 35:39.846
Okay.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.851
Taylor loved this house.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.229
I suppose that's what brought me
here tonight

35:48.229 --> 35:50.065
to feel closer to her.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.863
Oh, and we should've
had that painted over

35:56.863 --> 35:58.990
before they installed
the wallpaper.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.203
Did Taylor write that?

36:04.746 --> 36:06.081

36:06.081 --> 36:08.583

When my daughter was younger

36:08.583 --> 36:10.126
she was so put together.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.421
Everything came easy for her.

36:13.421 --> 36:16.007
Sports, grades, love.

36:18.301 --> 36:21.679
And then something changed
when she started teaching.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.892
She became paranoid
and...sometimes delusional.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.354
I suspected
she didn't like her job

36:29.354 --> 36:31.189
but she didn't wanna
disappoint me.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.776
And I, I tried to get her help.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.069
But she didn't trust me.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.904
She didn't trust anyone,
not even Nolan.

36:38.696 --> 36:39.697
Were they close?

36:40.698 --> 36:42.826
They learnt very early

36:42.826 --> 36:44.828
two against one were good odds.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.913
[chuckles]
And they stuck together
like glue.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.040
When either one of them
got in trouble

36:49.040 --> 36:51.709
neither would ever
turn on the other.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.296
And I pretended like it bothered
me but I was proud of them.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.053
Made me happy to know that

37:02.053 --> 37:04.139
when I was gone,
they would have each other.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.559
What do they say..

37:07.559 --> 37:10.311
"People plan and God laughs."

37:11.646 --> 37:14.023
Yeah.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.568
Is there anything
I can do for you?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.528
Don't waste your time here
pretending to be

37:18.528 --> 37:21.072
something you're not.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.575
If you really did come here
to help our students

37:23.575 --> 37:25.743
you need to be yourself.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.287
You're a survivor, Alison.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.414
At all costs.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.042
And that's what you need
to teach them.

Hi!

38:00.361 --> 38:02.197
Hi, I'm so glad you picked up.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.825
No, I'm fine, I ju..

38:05.825 --> 38:08.495
Just needed to hear
a friend's voice.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.371
How are you?
How's Caleb?

38:10.371 --> 38:12.582
How's the baby?

38:12.582 --> 38:14.626
Wait, Hannah, back up.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.004
Wait, what do you mean
Spencer and Toby eloped?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.589
[chuckles]

38:19.589 --> 38:21.049
Even you didn't know?

38:22.592 --> 38:25.345
Oh, wow!

38:25.345 --> 38:27.472
Well, are they
registered somewhere?

38:28.932 --> 38:32.268
Of course, I wanna
get them a gift!

38:32.268 --> 38:35.313
[exhales]
It is so good to hear
your voice too.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.689
I really miss you.

Um, we're, we're
in the middle of a class.

the best time to find

'a few of your students
all together.'

Isn't there a better time?

39:53.641 --> 39:54.726
I wouldn't be here if there was

39:54.726 --> 39:56.603
but I'm investigating a murder.

'Sorry to pull
you out of class.'

40:14.329 --> 40:17.040
But I understand that three
of you were close with Nolan.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.750
And I just wanted to know
where you were

40:18.750 --> 40:19.876
the night he was killed.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.378
- Um..
- Um..

Oh, good, you're still here.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.673
I never thanked you guys
for staying late

40:25.673 --> 40:27.717

a welcome basket'

40:30.094 --> 40:33.139

their entire night.

They were with you
the night of the murder.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.894
Don't get me started
on Agatha Christie's decision

the rules of writing'

'by making it nearly impossible'

40:42.690 --> 40:45.902
for her readers to figure out
the crime on their own.

40:47.487 --> 40:50.114
I mean, you can ask
the three of them.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.658
They know from experience.

40:51.658 --> 40:53.493
I can talk for hours.

You've convinced me
to read the book again.
