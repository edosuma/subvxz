WEBVTT

00:08.182 --> 00:10.793
I didn't know wedding dress
shopping could be so fun.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.447
JANKO: For who?Come on, you
look beautiful

00:12.490 --> 00:14.057
in everything.

00:14.101 --> 00:17.234
With a little more champagne,
I might want to try one on.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.062
Not so fast.
You're not getting married

00:19.106 --> 00:21.064
before you're 30.You did.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.761
Yeah. Exactly.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.067
JANKO:
I've never met Jack.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.417
Do you guys get along?We got along great

00:26.461 --> 00:28.637
when we were both
in the D.A.'s office.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.117
We couldn't get enough
of each other.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.162
But then when he became

00:32.206 --> 00:34.947
a defense attorney, we never
saw each other, and it...

00:34.991 --> 00:36.688
just went south from there.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.125
Because you never saw him,

00:38.168 --> 00:40.127
or because you guys
didn't work together anymore?

00:40.170 --> 00:42.172
A little bit of both.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.434
Oh.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.654
So... everything was good

00:45.697 --> 00:48.265
up until you guys decided
to stop working together?

00:48.309 --> 00:51.573
Mm, it's a little more
complicated than that.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.792
Oh.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.405
Do you need help in there?

01:00.190 --> 01:01.278
Beautiful!

01:01.322 --> 01:03.324
Gorgeous! Just...

01:03.367 --> 01:04.847
wow!

01:04.890 --> 01:06.196
Wow.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.632
ERIN:
Ah,

01:07.676 --> 01:09.156
so gorgeous.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.461
Oh, wow, that's...

01:10.505 --> 01:12.246
it's-it's too much.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.423
Yeah, that's...
that's a little pricey.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.120
But you only live once.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.165
Right.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.341
Yes. She's right.
You should get it.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.516
NICKY:
Definitely.

01:21.559 --> 01:22.865
You think?

01:22.908 --> 01:24.214
Yes.Yes.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.650
ERIN:
How do you feel?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.826
: I don't know.Huh?

01:38.576 --> 01:40.404
BAKER: Here's your schedule
for the rest of the day.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.971
What about it?So, there's your
11:00 a.m.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.538
Well, that's a conflict
right there.
Okay.

01:43.581 --> 01:44.887
We got to move...Push that.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.454
Detective Baker.
Lieutenant Gormley.

01:46.497 --> 01:47.672
Frank.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.805
Nice turnout--
but you always bring a crowd.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.459
Anything I can do to help.

01:51.502 --> 01:55.245
Well, we... we happen
to be shy a few volunteers

01:55.289 --> 01:57.900
to be pen pals
to the incarcerated.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.989
Oh, I'm kind of busy
putting them away, Kevin.

02:00.032 --> 02:03.035
I'm not sure I'd also have
the time to write to them.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.254
Well, it's either that
or sign up

02:04.298 --> 02:05.690
for the soup kitchen
every other Sunday.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.257
Well, I'll let you know.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.911
Guy over there glad-handing,

02:08.954 --> 02:11.653
there's something
about him.

02:11.696 --> 02:14.743
Aw, it's just the old cop in me.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.179
What award's he getting?

02:16.223 --> 02:17.702
You're kidding.Nope.

02:17.746 --> 02:20.140
The Saint Teresa Award,
which you endorsed him for.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.315
The hell I did.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.446
Excuse me?

02:22.490 --> 02:23.665
The heckI did.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.841
Frank, your face

02:25.884 --> 02:27.582
and your quotes
praising his work

02:27.625 --> 02:29.758
are plastered
all over his website.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.680
Introduce me.

02:40.769 --> 02:41.987
Liam.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.556
You know Commissioner Reagan,
of course.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.776
Well...

02:47.819 --> 02:49.169
who doesn't?

02:49.212 --> 02:51.562
But I don't know you.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.702
So, how'd the
dress shopping go?

03:00.745 --> 03:03.139
Fun. Expensive.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.619
Nostalgic.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.011
Nostalgic for your own?

03:06.055 --> 03:07.883
Yeah. I had
so much fun at ours.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.754
I had fun at mine,
too, but...

03:09.798 --> 03:11.147
it was soover-the-top.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.323
I mean, we literally came
up through the floor.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.195
Smoke machines,
the whole bit.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.719
We had a five-piece band
at ours.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.591
We danced the whole night.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.203
Who knew it was all
downhill from there?

03:23.246 --> 03:25.727
It wasn't alldownhill.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.643
Jack.Frank,

03:28.686 --> 03:30.253
Henry, Joe...

03:30.297 --> 03:33.387
Danny and Jamie-- I had warnings
from all five of them.

03:33.430 --> 03:34.736
You did not.I did.

03:34.779 --> 03:35.998
I swear.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.304
They are a tough bunch.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.870
JACK: Imagine marrying
their only daughter

03:38.914 --> 03:39.915
and sister.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.656
I'm lucky I'm
alive to tell it.

03:41.699 --> 03:44.093
What brings you down here?

03:44.136 --> 03:46.922
I was wondering if you could
look into a friend's complaint.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.054
She was robbed about
two weeks ago.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.882
Is there a suspect
in custody?

03:50.926 --> 03:53.320
No arrests. And she, uh,
she tried following up,

03:53.363 --> 03:54.886
but she's getting the runaround.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.714
We can look into it.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.716
That'd be great.
I appreciate it.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.152
And her name's Collette Dawkins.

04:00.196 --> 04:03.547
If we find something,
we'll give you a call.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.722
Thanks.

04:04.766 --> 04:05.767
Mm-hmm.

04:09.031 --> 04:12.295
Do not say it, Erin.Just please look into it.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.297
I don't know why you
always fall for this guy.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.559
I'm not falling for anything.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.169
He asked for assistance
in a case.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.955
That guy's always
got an angle.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.790
It's a white dress
with a sweetheart neckline.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.531
I thought you weren't supposed
to tell me what it looks like.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.315
Do you have any idea
what a sweetheart neckline is?

04:32.359 --> 04:34.361
None.Exactly.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.928
I can't help it,
I'm just so excited.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.715
Not as excited as
you seem to be

04:40.758 --> 04:42.238
that I'm your driver today.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.372
It just kind of threw me
when you volunteered.

04:45.415 --> 04:46.764
I thought you'd be happy.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.984
Don't you miss

04:49.027 --> 04:50.812
riding together sometimes?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.204
Yes.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.772
Stop, please!

04:54.816 --> 04:56.339
I need help! I need help!

04:56.383 --> 04:58.428
Hey, what happened?

04:58.472 --> 04:59.821
He collapsed.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.650
I called 911,
but they're not here.

05:02.693 --> 05:03.651
Okay, okay.

05:03.694 --> 05:04.695
Did he choke on anything?No.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.175
Please, do something.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.568
Let's get him to St. Benjamin's.
Come on.Okay, okay.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.570
I got you.

05:13.922 --> 05:16.403
Here, let me get you
in the front.

05:16.446 --> 05:17.882
What's his name?Jeremy.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.930
Hey, Jeremy, you there?
You in there, bud?

05:21.973 --> 05:23.975
Hail Mary...

05:32.984 --> 05:36.858
23-year-old Meredith Davis.
Lives alone.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.903
Found her about 20 minutes ago.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.474
Suicide note?I didn't see one.

05:44.518 --> 05:47.303
No forced entry.
No.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.435
And the super let us in.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.697
BAEZ: We're gonna need
to talk to him.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.220
WOMAN: Excuse me.OFFICER: Ma'am. Ma'am!

05:51.263 --> 05:52.656
WOMAN:
Officer, I'm her mother.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.964
Ma'am, I can't...Meredith. Meredith?

05:57.095 --> 05:58.358
She blew past me.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.883
My daughter?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.188
We're very sorry, ma'am.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.755
You're not gonna want
to go in there.

06:04.799 --> 06:05.843
Looks like a suicide.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.066
Officer Reyes, please
escort her down.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.285
Have an EMS look at her,
help her out.Come with me, please.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.331
Come with me.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.337
There's a woman outside

06:21.381 --> 06:23.600
that says she has some
information about the victim.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.386
Great. Why don't you
let her in, too?

06:28.692 --> 06:30.215
The woman over there.
Name's Maggie Gibson.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.217
She claims she knows
what happened to the vic.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.481
All right. Thanks.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.878
Excuse me, miss.
Detective Reagan.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.663
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

06:42.706 --> 06:43.968
We're told you have
some information

06:44.012 --> 06:45.753
that might be helpful to us.Yes.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.582
The young woman upstairs,
the one that killed herself?Mm-hmm.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.540
She didn't die from suicide.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.324
She was murdered.

06:52.368 --> 06:54.022
Are you a family member?

06:54.065 --> 06:55.937
I'm just a concerned citizen.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.940
Do you even know
the woman upstairs?
No.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.942
Yet you know that
she was murdered.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.552
I'm positive.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.336
Uh-huh.
And you know this how?

07:04.380 --> 07:05.773
Because she told me.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.166
She told you that somebody
wanted to kill her?

07:08.210 --> 07:11.692
She told me that
somebody did kill her.

07:11.735 --> 07:15.043
Are you saying
you talk to the dead?

07:15.086 --> 07:18.176
Actually, the dead talk to me.

07:21.223 --> 07:24.835
And you're convinced that our
suicide is actually a homicide?

07:24.879 --> 07:26.489
No question.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.187
And you know this because
after she was killed,

07:29.231 --> 07:31.494
she told you that
she was murdered.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.496
I'm a medium.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.846
In my world, that's called
a scam artist.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.980
I'm not looking for money,
I'm looking for justice.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.852
Right. Justice for a woman
that you don't know

07:41.896 --> 07:43.158
and you never met.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.986
That's right.Not for nothing,

07:45.029 --> 07:47.379
but the only people who
show up at a crime scene

07:47.423 --> 07:48.685
are typically the
friends and family,

07:48.729 --> 07:50.687
which we've already
established you're not,

07:50.731 --> 07:53.168
or psychos, or the perp.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.083
So, which one are you?Neither.

07:55.126 --> 07:57.215
Where were you
between the hours

07:57.259 --> 07:58.695
of 5:00 and 9:00 a.m. today?

07:58.739 --> 08:01.306
I was at my apartment on 69th,
a few blocks away.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.004
Anyone we can check that with?

08:03.047 --> 08:05.310
This has all my information.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.617
Please feel free to check
whatever you like.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.227
Can I speak with the family?

08:09.271 --> 08:10.968
No. Leave the family alone.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.796
The locket is important.

08:12.840 --> 08:13.928
What locket?

08:13.971 --> 08:15.886
The locket she was wearing
when she died.

08:17.845 --> 08:21.413
You find that locket,
you'll find the killer.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.707
And what's this guy's scam?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.143
GORMLEY:
Grand larceny.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.623
Posing as a charity
that helps people

08:56.666 --> 08:59.103
who couldn't otherwise
afford it to check something

08:59.147 --> 09:00.975
off their bucket list
before they die.

09:01.018 --> 09:03.020
And the money comes from...

09:03.064 --> 09:04.587
Private and public grants,

09:04.631 --> 09:06.720
crowdfunding websites
and social media.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.460
And we're certain that
goes into his pocket?

09:08.504 --> 09:10.332
We haven't had time
to track down

09:10.375 --> 09:13.291
all his alleged good deeds,
but safe to assume.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.858
Does he have a record?

09:14.902 --> 09:17.382
28 months for a previous
grand larceny.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.123
Do you want to know
what you said?

09:19.167 --> 09:21.038
No."There is no more
worthy charity

09:21.082 --> 09:22.431
"than the Last Hurrah,

09:22.474 --> 09:25.042
and no more charitable man
than Liam Norris."

09:25.086 --> 09:28.132
Okay.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.874
Oh, and I want to know
the minute he gets here.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.615
He's here.

09:35.009 --> 09:37.489
He's early.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.449
His temperature?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.494
Hot.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.888
Oh, boy.

09:44.932 --> 09:48.152
I'll just go...

09:58.989 --> 10:00.991
I want this guy Norris
prosecuted

10:01.035 --> 10:03.124
to the full extent
of the law.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.214
Well, I guess that
answers my question

10:06.257 --> 10:09.260
about whether the archdiocese
wants to press charges.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.262
Just make sure he gets
put away for the max.

10:11.306 --> 10:14.309
Well, look, if he skimmed
more than $1,000

10:14.352 --> 10:15.963
off his bogus charity--

10:16.006 --> 10:17.834
and I'll bet 1,000
that he did--

10:17.878 --> 10:19.880
he's likely guilty
of grand larceny.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.185
Good.

10:21.229 --> 10:25.233
And what is with
the fire and brimstone, Kevin?

10:25.276 --> 10:27.975
He lied.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.455
He used the Church
for his own good.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.979
And I thought he was
helping people,

10:32.022 --> 10:33.154
not rewarding himself.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.764
Frank,

10:34.808 --> 10:37.245
this story simply
cannot get out.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.334
You mean the one where
you don't vet the people

10:39.377 --> 10:41.423
you give awards to?

10:41.466 --> 10:42.990
There were testimonials,
there were photos,

10:43.033 --> 10:44.600
there were videos.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.690
I-I don't want to see myself
on the front page of the paper

10:47.734 --> 10:50.824
being mocked for giving a
humanitarian award to a shyster.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.870
The Catholic Church can't afford
any more bad publicity.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.873
This is not that.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.919
Do I have to explain to you,
of all people,

10:58.962 --> 11:00.921
how much, well, how much good
the Church does

11:00.964 --> 11:02.749
for the impoverished
of this city?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.359
Then why are you, Kevin?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.753
Do you realize how bad this
is gonna look if it gets out?

11:06.796 --> 11:09.233
How much it's going to damage
the good that we do?

11:09.277 --> 11:11.366
Who is gonna want to support
the charities we run

11:11.409 --> 11:13.716
that feed the poor
and house the homeless?

11:13.760 --> 11:16.371
Look, it's most likely
gonna end up in a plea deal.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.895
He'll do jail time
'cause of his record,

11:18.939 --> 11:21.419
no trial,
and hopefully no story.

11:21.463 --> 11:24.205
"Hopefully"?Well, I can't promise.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.728
But I'll do everything I can

11:25.772 --> 11:27.208
to keep it out of the paper.You've got to do

11:27.251 --> 11:29.253
more than that, Frank.

11:29.297 --> 11:32.082
I can no longer tolerate
people using the Church

11:32.126 --> 11:34.476
for their own profit.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.872
Thanks for dropping by.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.621
Mrs. Rodriguez?

11:49.665 --> 11:51.232
We've stabilized him.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.800
But he could've died.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.453
Why didn't he have
his insulin?

11:55.497 --> 11:57.586
He's diabetic?He was in diabetic shock

11:57.629 --> 11:58.979
because he didn't get
an insulin shot today.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.154
I gave it to him this morning.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.982
Let's see the insulin
that you gave him.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.635
Uh, it's at home.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.202
I need to see my son.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.464
JAMIE: If you give us
permission to go

12:06.508 --> 12:07.683
and get the insulin,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.467
then you can stay here
and see your son.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.208
Whatever, it's in the kitchen.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.167
I just want to see Jeremy,
please.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.824
Stay with her at all times.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.437
It could be an honest mistake.She lied.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.134
I want ACS on this.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.788
We'll notify Child Services.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.051
Great, 'cause we need
to protect him

12:28.095 --> 12:29.966
from his own mother.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.408
Thank you for coming in.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.323
So, you believe
she-she would never...

12:40.585 --> 12:42.544
You'll look into it, right?

12:42.587 --> 12:44.807
I promise you, as soon
as we get any more information,

12:44.851 --> 12:46.591
we'll call you right away.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.333
You see this locket?

12:49.377 --> 12:50.857
She never took it off.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.728
It was my grandmother's
and then my mother's

12:52.772 --> 12:56.993
and mine. I gave it to her
on her 21st birthday.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.995
And it's missing.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.345
Okay, um...

13:01.389 --> 13:02.433
we'll see what we can do.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.957
Do you mind
if we hold onto this?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.439
Gonna have this officer
take you home, all right?

13:08.483 --> 13:11.138
Thank you.You're welcome.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.053
Danny.

13:13.096 --> 13:15.272
It's a coincidence. Come on.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.621
There's no signs
of forced entry,

13:16.665 --> 13:18.580
and this girl,
she had a history of problems

13:18.623 --> 13:20.800
with nobody anywhere, ever.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.715
Yeah, but we don't have
a suicide note, either.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.108
Is there any security cameras
on the building?

13:25.152 --> 13:26.849
None that work, so I
have security footage

13:26.893 --> 13:28.111
from surrounding buildings.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.547
I'll get the popcorn.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.288
Did anyone

13:31.332 --> 13:33.160
ever tell you that
you're really annoying?

13:33.203 --> 13:35.902
Pretty much everyone.You have called me

13:35.945 --> 13:38.339
five times about
Meredith Davis's autopsy,

13:38.382 --> 13:40.167
including on my personal phone.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.082
And did you come down here
to tell me that I annoy you,

13:42.125 --> 13:44.388
or do you have some information
about that autopsy?

13:44.432 --> 13:46.782
I came here to tell you
that Meredith Davis

13:46.826 --> 13:48.523
had a contusion on her head.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.046
Postmortem.No.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.787
So you're saying

13:51.831 --> 13:53.920
she got into a fight
before she died?

13:53.963 --> 13:57.401
I'm saying that she sustained
blunt force trauma to her head.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.969
Figuring out if that's
accidental or intentional

14:00.013 --> 14:01.623
is your job.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.277
Okay. Thanks for coming down.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.845
Stop calling me.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.897
And that's when he punched me
in the face.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.943
Can you send me a copy of this?

14:16.986 --> 14:18.379
Of course.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.729
How do you know Jack?Social media.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.513
Social media. How's that?

14:22.557 --> 14:24.385
You meet on Facebook
or something?

14:24.428 --> 14:25.777
OkCupid.

14:25.821 --> 14:28.258
You're dating him?

14:28.302 --> 14:30.260
We went on some dates.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.306
Are you two serious?

14:32.349 --> 14:35.744
He's got his eye
on someone else.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.922
If she was hit hard enough,

14:39.966 --> 14:41.402
maybe she went unconscious.Yeah.

14:41.445 --> 14:44.100
But then she'd have to get
hoisted up there

14:44.144 --> 14:45.319
and make it look like a suicide.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.450
You'd have to stand
on something,

14:46.494 --> 14:48.191
which could be possible.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.845
Hey, while you're here,
why don't you, uh,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.325
dust off the toilet seat

14:51.368 --> 14:52.500
and the, uh, bathtub.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.718
See if there's another footprint

14:53.762 --> 14:56.112
that doesn't belong to Meredith.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.468
Danny.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.604
Looks a little big

15:09.647 --> 15:11.649
for Meredith's foot,
don't you think?

15:12.650 --> 15:15.088
Huh.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.917
Maybe the mother's intuition
was right.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.744
Or the medium's.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.714
Thank you so much for
inviting me up, Commissioner.

15:35.456 --> 15:38.676
I can't tell you
what an honor it is.

15:40.722 --> 15:44.682
I'm afraid that perhaps you and
I got off on the wrong foot.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.293
Perhaps.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.685
Look, I understand...You have committed

15:47.729 --> 15:50.732
criminal impersonation
and identity theft

15:50.775 --> 15:52.864
against the New York City
Police Commissioner

15:52.908 --> 15:55.867
and the Catholic Church,
and that is just for starters.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.695
Nah.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.654
No, no. May I sit?

15:59.697 --> 16:01.177
Nah.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.136
Okay.

16:03.179 --> 16:07.227
Oh, I, uh, brought you
a token of my esteem.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.410
You know, this is all
a big misunderstanding.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.108
Now, my charity
helps worthy cases

16:19.152 --> 16:20.631
fulfill their dreams.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.243
When this is cleared up,
you'll be thanking me.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.941
For using my name without
my knowledge or permission?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.943
I bet you would
endorse my foundation

16:27.987 --> 16:29.989
once you understand
what we do.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.034
Oh, I understand what you do.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.123
You're a grifter.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.169
No, I am an imperfect man

16:36.212 --> 16:38.040
who changed his ways
before it was too late.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.434
And I decided that my legacy

16:40.477 --> 16:43.045
would be to help others check
a box on their bucket list.

16:43.089 --> 16:46.005
Good. So, you will give us
your financial records.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.354
Well, you keep in mind

16:47.397 --> 16:50.661
that every foundation
pays their employees.

16:50.705 --> 16:54.013
You're the only employee.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.277
I have overhead.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.107
And I have lawyers,
as does the archbishop,

17:01.150 --> 17:03.979
and charges we can press.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.589
And what good
would come of that?

17:05.633 --> 17:07.287
I am giving you 24 hours

17:07.330 --> 17:10.986
to submit your charity's
financial statements.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.597
I have nothing to hide.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.600
Is everything
out of your mouth a lie?

17:16.644 --> 17:19.560
That must be exhausting.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.565
Thank you, Commissioner.
I won't let you down.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.046
I won't hold my breath.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.011
JANKO: Just saying, what if we
didn't work together anymore?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.187
What if we weren't
in the same profession

17:38.231 --> 17:40.233
and in the same station house?

17:40.276 --> 17:42.104
And?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.975
Well, what if this,

17:44.019 --> 17:45.890
our-our chemistry,
our relationship,

17:45.934 --> 17:49.024
what if that's what
it's based on? On work?

17:49.068 --> 17:51.679
And what if we
didn't have that?

17:51.722 --> 17:53.507
Eddie, where is
this coming from?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.378
Is that why you wanted us
to ride together today?

17:55.422 --> 17:57.772
Me? No. 'Course not.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.121
I'm just saying...

17:59.165 --> 18:01.036
Doc.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.038
Doctor,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.300
did you get the
test results back?

18:04.344 --> 18:06.085
We've examined the vial
and the syringe

18:06.128 --> 18:07.477
that you found at the apartment.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.913
Mm-hmm.Neither of them

18:08.957 --> 18:10.524
contained traces of insulin.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.787
Could there be a mistake
with the medication?

18:12.830 --> 18:15.485
I see parents neglect their kids
every damn day of the week.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.357
I've admitted him
to the pediatric ward.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.882
At least there I know he's safe.
For now.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.152
My assistant said you called.
I was in court.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.719
Yeah, so she said.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.722
Hey, I-I really appreciate
your help with the Dawkins case.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.159
I bet you do.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.465
Something wrong?

18:38.508 --> 18:41.859
You could have mentioned
she's your girlfriend.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.166
She's not my girlfriend.
She's my ex.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.081
"Ex" as in...?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.909
Uh, as in we dated
for a while.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.867
A while?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.826
Maybe half a dozen dates.

18:51.869 --> 18:55.351
Uh, that's what single
men do, Erin. We date.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.745
Yeah, you left that part out.I asked you

18:57.788 --> 19:00.182
to help
because she was victimized

19:00.226 --> 19:02.706
and no one was doing anything
about it.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.969
Jack to the rescue.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.842
I really don't know
what you're mad about.

19:07.885 --> 19:09.626
You're dishonest, Jack.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.193
Every time
I start trusting you,

19:11.237 --> 19:12.629
you do something like this.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.328
Every single time.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.336
Where'd you get the insulin?I don't have to talk to you.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.902
Your son could've died.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.166
Leave me alone. I'm working.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.602
All right, we leave you
alone, you're gonna end up

19:28.645 --> 19:29.994
in an interrogation room

19:30.038 --> 19:31.605
charged with endangering
the welfare of your child.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.389
Is that what you want?

19:33.433 --> 19:35.391
I gave him the insulin,
and no one believes me.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.827
You gave him water.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.264
What are you talking about?

19:38.307 --> 19:41.180
We tested it.
You injected Jeremy with water.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.920
I bought insulin.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.313
Insulin costs $191

19:44.357 --> 19:46.315
for one vial.
I'm a single mom.

19:46.359 --> 19:49.144
I don't have health insurance.
You do the math.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.842
Well, who'd you buy it from?

19:51.886 --> 19:55.237
Someone told me I can get
prescriptions cheaper online.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.326
So I did. I paid cash.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.849
He met me in Williamsburg,

19:58.893 --> 20:01.156
gave me the insulin
and disappeared.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.505
Who? You have his number?

20:02.549 --> 20:05.378
A woman from Child Services

20:05.421 --> 20:08.424
told me that they're gonna take
my son away from me.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.298
Not if you can help us prove
it wasn't your fault.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.256
I would never do anything
to hurt him.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.127
Never.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.870
We believe you.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.233
That's where I bought it from.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.587
What do you got?

20:40.630 --> 20:42.806
Crime scene got the shoe print,
and a few specs of blood,

20:42.850 --> 20:44.895
but no fingerprints
other than Meredith's.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.549
How about a match on the blood?

20:46.593 --> 20:49.160
It's a partial profile, which
is gonna make it impossible

20:49.204 --> 20:50.640
to pinpoint the suspect.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.642
Impossible?
Nothing's impossible.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.818
We've been up against greater
odds before, believe me.

20:54.862 --> 20:58.692
Okay, well, not impossible,
but a little help would be nice.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.520
Help? What do you mean, help?

21:00.563 --> 21:03.305
I asked Maggie to meet us
at the apartment.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.307
Maggie.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.483
The medium.I know who she is.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.442
You really want to
encourage that whacko?

21:09.485 --> 21:11.618
She said she'd get a better read
if she was in the place

21:11.661 --> 21:12.923
where the crime took place.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.577
Great. Maybe we should
bring some tarot cards,

21:14.621 --> 21:16.884
and they might tell us
who killed Meredith Davis.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.281
MAGGIE:
There was a struggle...

21:22.324 --> 21:23.934
DANNY:
Which is what typically occurs

21:23.978 --> 21:27.373
between two people when one's
trying to kill the other one.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.506
He was trying to kiss
her, and she hit him.

21:30.550 --> 21:33.944
She hit him here.
He was bleeding, here.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.033
And then,
she went for the phone,

21:36.077 --> 21:38.862
he grabbed her, he pushed her.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.343
She didn't want to die.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.866
Yeah, most people don't.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.347
He has her locket.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.567
You can't give us any kind
of description of him?

21:47.610 --> 21:49.873
No, just a, a uniform.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.745
A gray uniform.
That's all I know.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.486
Okay, well,
how about a name?

21:53.529 --> 21:56.793
First name, last name,
a name on the uniform,

21:56.837 --> 21:58.882
of the company he worked for?

21:58.926 --> 22:01.145
'Cause that's what would
really be helpful here.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.538
Right. Well,
it doesn't work that way.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.453
Oh, okay. How does it work?

22:04.497 --> 22:08.370
Oh, right. You prey on people
when they're most vulnerable.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.719
I'm sorry
that you don't believe,

22:09.763 --> 22:11.765
but that's your problem,
not mine.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.115
My only problem is
that you're wasting our time

22:14.158 --> 22:15.986
with all this mumbo jumbo.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.640
Okay, we have a case

22:17.684 --> 22:20.208
to solve here, and we got work
to do, so, I'm done.You know,

22:20.251 --> 22:22.515
I find that people who don't
believe in my gift are the ones

22:22.558 --> 22:24.038
that are most afraid of it.

22:24.081 --> 22:26.823
I'm not afraid
of your gift, okay?

22:26.867 --> 22:29.391
Like I said, I got work to do.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.306
Who's Linda?

22:36.006 --> 22:37.965
What did you say to me?

22:38.008 --> 22:39.488
Is that your wife?

22:44.493 --> 22:46.495
You should probably go.

22:47.627 --> 22:48.802
Danny...

22:48.845 --> 22:50.412
No. Really.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.632
You should go.

23:09.692 --> 23:13.653
This is Antoine Reynard,
26, from Rosedale, Queens.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.872
That's the guy
who robbed your ex.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.308
I picked him up
this morning.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.093
We can charge him with robbery
in the second degree

23:19.136 --> 23:21.095
and assault
if your friend can ID him.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.097
Thank you, Anthony.

23:23.140 --> 23:26.883
I'm sure Collette will be
very, very grateful.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.189
You two need
anything else?

23:28.232 --> 23:29.669
I got work to do on a case.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.714
Which one?Any.

23:31.758 --> 23:32.933
I'll make one up.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.065
Take care, Jack.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.197
Thanks again.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.115
I just want
you to know

23:41.158 --> 23:43.857
that I had no ulterior motives
in this case.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.164
I wanted to help her out because
it was the right thing to do.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.122
Oh, please.Sorry.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.776
Do the Reagans have a monopoly

23:49.819 --> 23:52.996
on good deeds to, uh... to fit
in with the self-righteousness?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.651
Don't make this
about my family, Jack.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.740
I'm a single man.
I'm allowed to date.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.612
Didn't say you couldn't.

23:59.655 --> 24:00.874
Then, what is the problem?

24:00.917 --> 24:02.484
I can't be expected
to be faithful

24:02.528 --> 24:04.530
if you and I are not even
in a relationship.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.706
Right. We just have booty calls.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.839
Erin,

24:09.883 --> 24:12.755
I don't understand
what you are mad at here.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.497
Why couldn't you have just said,
"She's my ex"?Because

24:15.541 --> 24:16.542
I didn't think it was relevant.

24:16.585 --> 24:17.847
You didn't think
it was a problem

24:17.891 --> 24:19.545
to ask me to get involved
in a criminal case

24:19.588 --> 24:20.850
where the victim
is your girlfriend

24:20.894 --> 24:22.939
so you can make points with her?The only woman

24:22.983 --> 24:25.899
that I've ever tried
to make points with is you.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.640
But it is impossible

24:27.683 --> 24:29.642
to live up
to your expectations.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.295
And-and that's the Reagan way.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.384
You raise the bar so high

24:33.428 --> 24:36.823
that absolutely nobody
can live up to it.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.349
Hey, mission accomplished.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.012
I don't know.
I just don't believe it.JANKO: Well, what about

24:52.055 --> 24:54.884
those psychics that help police
close cold murder cases?

24:54.928 --> 24:57.887
Baloney.So, you think the
medium is scamming you?

24:57.931 --> 25:00.107
Yes, pretty much.NICKY:
But wait a minute.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.238
What is she really
getting out of it

25:01.282 --> 25:02.718
if she's not making
any money off of it?

25:02.762 --> 25:03.850
I don't know what
she's getting out of it.

25:03.893 --> 25:04.764
Maybe attention. Who knows?

25:04.807 --> 25:06.287
Not all scams
are about money.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.464
Disagree.
Well, I got a guy
running a fake charity,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.684
I could care less what
his motivation is.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.468
Is that that bucket list
thing you were talking about?

25:13.512 --> 25:15.426
Yeah.See, that I'm all in.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.819
I love bucket lists.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.300
What's on yours?

25:19.343 --> 25:20.823
Nothing's on my bucket list.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.303
Nothing?

25:22.346 --> 25:24.827
Got everything I want,
seen too much as it is.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.437
DANNY:
I'm with you, Dad.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.483
Though with all the speeding
through the streets of New York

25:28.527 --> 25:31.355
I've done in my career, I would
like to try my hand at Le Mans.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.097
That's it?It's in France,

25:34.141 --> 25:36.317
and I'd have to drive
for Team Porsche. That's a lot.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.493
I got at least a dozen
things that I want to do.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.016
You're 16.
I'd hope so.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.017
Such as?

25:41.061 --> 25:42.758
Skydive over
Mount Everest.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.543
Ski the Alps.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.718
DANNY:
Hmm. That's great.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.720
Except you don't ski.I'll learn.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.810
I'd like to sing backup
at a Taylor Swift concert.

25:50.853 --> 25:51.941
Oh.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.334
I'd like to surf in Tahiti.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.728
I would also like a million
followers on Instagram.

25:55.771 --> 25:56.990
SEAN: Know a great
way to do that?

25:57.033 --> 25:58.600
Skydive over

25:58.644 --> 25:59.732
Mount Everest.

25:59.775 --> 26:00.820
JAMIE:
Also,

26:00.863 --> 26:02.430
I want to sleep
in one of those huts

26:02.473 --> 26:03.605
on the water
in Bora Bora.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.824
Mm.
Mm.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.477
Well, a real nature boy,
aren't you?

26:06.521 --> 26:07.827
We could do that
on our honeymoon.

26:07.870 --> 26:08.958
HENRY:
Just don't have

26:09.002 --> 26:10.481
the ceremony there.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.222
I don't want to travel
that far for it.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.311
What about you, Pop?Top of my bucket list?

26:14.355 --> 26:15.922
Mm-hmm.Don't kick the bucket.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.489
Come on.

26:18.533 --> 26:21.449
Well, I always wanted
to visit the Vatican.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.103
Well, Betty and I--
we were supposed

26:23.146 --> 26:24.757
to do it on our 50th,

26:24.800 --> 26:26.846
but, uh, then she got sick,

26:26.889 --> 26:29.370
and, uh, we had to cancel.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.332
Did you know

26:35.376 --> 26:37.639
Pop always wanted
to go to the Vatican?

26:37.683 --> 26:40.555
You know, he never
mentioned it.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.384
That's my biggest fear--

26:43.427 --> 26:45.995
that I'll get old and regret
the things I didn't do.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.781
Anything in particular?

26:50.696 --> 26:52.785
You know, our jobs--

26:52.828 --> 26:56.136
one of the side effects is that
it makes us doubt everyone,

26:56.179 --> 26:57.746
even the ones closest to us.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.966
Occupational hazard.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.882
I know you don't like Jack.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.493
That is correct.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.495
Sorry.

27:07.538 --> 27:11.151
I know you have a soft spot
for him, always have.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.719
It just makes me wonder
if maybe part of the problem

27:13.762 --> 27:15.329
was the way
I handled things with him.

27:15.372 --> 27:18.549
Strike first,
and ask questions later.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.639
No, you have high expectations.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.031
There's nothing wrong with that.

27:22.075 --> 27:25.731
We're just so trained to look
for the bad in people

27:25.774 --> 27:28.559
that maybe if we let it...

27:28.603 --> 27:32.346
it stops us
from seeing the good.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.177
You're saying our jobs
can make us immune

27:37.220 --> 27:39.005
to seeing the
good in people?

27:39.048 --> 27:41.877
I'm saying that's the danger.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.796
Jack accused me
of having expectations

27:47.840 --> 27:50.016
that were unrealistic.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.976
And what do you think?

27:56.022 --> 27:58.981
I think it's not so much
about lowering standards

27:59.025 --> 28:01.201
as it is...

28:01.244 --> 28:03.725
admitting that no one's perfect.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.034
Least of all us.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.219
Mrs. Rodriguez.

28:19.262 --> 28:21.917
Uh, you didn't have
to come all the way down here.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.005
When I saw your message...

28:23.049 --> 28:24.354
I just wanted you to know

28:24.398 --> 28:26.139
that we confirmed your story
about the fake drugs.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.706
You arrested them?

28:27.749 --> 28:29.533
Let's just say
we're working on it.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.535
Oh, thank God.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.234
I was so worried you wouldn't
believe me and I'd lose my son.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.019
I just hope that you can help
us, testify against them.

28:37.063 --> 28:39.761
I will, whatever I can do.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.111
How can I thank you
for all you've done?

28:42.155 --> 28:43.852
Please.And your partner, too.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.376
And for that
incredible donation.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.508
Donation?

28:47.551 --> 28:49.771
You both have
been so generous.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.599
Just, just...

28:51.642 --> 28:53.775
All right, okay.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.867
Have you been here all night?

28:58.911 --> 29:00.869
Only since midnight.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.871
It's 8:00 a.m.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.612
Yeah, well, couldn't sleep.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.223
Had six more hours of video
surveillance to go through.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.572
Somebody had to do it,

29:08.616 --> 29:09.660
so I did it.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.837
Well, why didn't
you call me?

29:11.880 --> 29:14.535
Danny, I'm really sorry
I dragged a medium into this.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.493
It was so stupid.

29:16.537 --> 29:17.581
It's okay.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.148
But when she
mentioned Linda...

29:19.192 --> 29:20.802
It's okay.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.804
I made a little discovery
last night.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.980
There's a, uh,
food delivery service.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.635
They deliver to Meredith's
neighbor in apartment 2B.

29:27.678 --> 29:30.551
And...?A security camera

29:30.594 --> 29:33.554
up the block
recorded footage of the van.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.034
I ran the plates.

29:35.077 --> 29:38.559
The driver of the route that day
was Steven Nagy.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.736
Okay?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.391
Steven Nagy,
registered sex offender.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.441
You just have to sign here,

29:51.485 --> 29:53.139
stating
that you ID'd number three

29:53.182 --> 29:55.663
as the person who
robbed and assaulted you.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.104
You have no idea
what this incident did to me.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.063
I am so happy it's over.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.804
Well, I'm glad we could help.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.023
I don't know how to thank you.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.460
Well, Jack's the one
you should really be thanking.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.854
Funny, he said
the same thing about you

30:12.898 --> 30:14.856
when I tried to thank him.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.032
You two should really
get together already.

30:17.076 --> 30:21.167
What... what is that
supposed to mean?

30:21.210 --> 30:22.733
DAWKINS:
Even when we dated,

30:22.777 --> 30:23.865
all he talked about was you.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.346
It's the reason
I broke up with him.

30:26.389 --> 30:30.306
It's like there were three of us
in the relationship.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.147
Keys...

30:47.976 --> 30:49.630
How'd it go?

30:49.673 --> 30:51.458
14 arrests.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.503
I'm so stoked we were
able to shut them down.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.114
No other mother
has to go through

30:55.157 --> 30:56.811
what Mrs. Rodriguez had to.And, miraculously,

30:56.855 --> 30:59.379
she received a donation
covering the next year's worth

30:59.422 --> 31:00.684
of insulin.Oh, really?

31:00.728 --> 31:01.772
That's nice.

31:01.816 --> 31:04.775
Would you know
anything about that?

31:07.953 --> 31:12.871
I decided I didn't need the most
expensive dress in the shop.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.176
And that is exactly
why I love you.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.439
Not because we work
in the same place

31:16.483 --> 31:19.138
or at the same job
or in the same building.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.791
Besides, if
I just wanted

31:20.835 --> 31:23.359
to date a female cop,
there's plenty in this precinct

31:23.403 --> 31:25.579
to choose from.

31:25.622 --> 31:28.147
Oh, I'd like to hit you
so bad right now.

31:28.190 --> 31:30.192
But you can't.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.978
But you can meet me
at Donovan's in an hour.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.023
You can hit me there.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.200
DANNY:
Uh, we're looking

31:38.244 --> 31:40.507
for information on a Steve Nagy.
He work here?

31:40.550 --> 31:41.987
Uh, he's been with us
about six months.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.685
Six months. Uh, okay.
How about on, uh, January 8th?

31:44.728 --> 31:47.296
You have any records
if he worked that day?

31:47.340 --> 31:49.037
Uh, he worked that day,

31:49.081 --> 31:52.345
but he left early
'cause he got injured.

31:52.388 --> 31:55.130
Injured how?
He got a gash

31:55.174 --> 31:56.784
on his cheek,
from a branch that fell on him.

31:56.827 --> 31:59.787
Hmm. Okay, uh,
is he working today?

31:59.830 --> 32:00.831
We'd like to talk to him.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.485
Um, he starts work
in five minutes,

32:02.529 --> 32:04.792
so he should be here
any minute now.

32:04.835 --> 32:07.012
Thanks.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.843
Steve Nagy?

32:12.887 --> 32:14.236
Detective Reagan,
my partner,

32:14.280 --> 32:15.759
Detective Baez. You mind
stepping out of the vehicle?

32:15.803 --> 32:16.891
We got a few questions.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.328
Hey. Hey. Hey!

32:19.372 --> 32:21.722
Hey!

32:40.959 --> 32:43.439
What are you doing?I'm calling his cell phone.

32:44.484 --> 32:45.702
Stop following me.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.835
We just want to talk
to you, Steven, that's it.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.663
You want to arrest me.

32:52.405 --> 32:53.972
Hang on.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.063
Why don't we both
just slow down

32:58.106 --> 32:59.803
and we can talk about this
face-to-face?

32:59.847 --> 33:01.805
I swear to God,
I didn't mean it.

33:01.849 --> 33:02.893
You didn't mean what?

33:10.510 --> 33:11.815
DANNY:
Hey, slow down your car.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.993
Okay? Just pull over
and let's talk about it.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.096
He still there?

33:32.619 --> 33:35.013
I just wanted her
to stop screaming.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.493
Okay, Steve, look,
take it easy.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.278
Okay, we'll talk it out
together.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.931
We'll figure something out,
okay?

33:40.975 --> 33:44.326
Now, here's what
I need you to do.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.285
I want you to turn off
the ignition,

33:46.328 --> 33:48.591
throw the keys out the window,

33:48.635 --> 33:50.289
put your hands on the dashboard,
all right?

33:50.332 --> 33:54.119
Can you tell her family...
that I'm sorry?

33:54.162 --> 33:55.816
No, you're gonna tell
her family that yourself,

33:55.859 --> 33:57.426
you understand me?

34:23.278 --> 34:25.280
Steve?

34:30.546 --> 34:32.548
He's gone.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.745
Don't worry,
I'm not working.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.008
They froze all my assets.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.445
I did that.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.143
Are any of those pictures real?

35:02.187 --> 35:05.103
Did you come all the way
out here just to rub it in?

35:05.146 --> 35:07.148
It was on my bucket list.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.715
All of 'em.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.456
And I got the notes
to go with them.

35:10.499 --> 35:14.547
Well, then I'd have to hire a
handwriting expert to verify.

35:14.590 --> 35:16.549
Okay. You know, I'm just gonna

35:16.592 --> 35:18.377
stand here and take it,
does that work for you?

35:18.420 --> 35:19.943
Yeah, that works.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.729
Vince D'Amato, 29th Infantry

35:22.772 --> 35:24.948
at D-Day, Omaha Beach.

35:24.992 --> 35:29.170
You got him, two of his vet
buddies airfare and a driver

35:29.214 --> 35:31.651
to the American Cemetery
over there

35:31.694 --> 35:34.654
about a month before
the cancer took him.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.786
Yes, I did. You saying I didn't?

35:36.830 --> 35:38.658
No.

35:38.701 --> 35:41.530
Here's what I don't get.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.880
Instead of just
having them driven there,

35:43.924 --> 35:46.492
you had the driver take them
down to the beach

35:46.535 --> 35:49.625
so that they could
climb up the bluffs,

35:49.669 --> 35:52.715
same as they did in '44.

35:52.759 --> 35:56.197
And then you arranged
for the guards

35:56.241 --> 35:58.721
to look the other way
when they came over the wall.

36:00.767 --> 36:02.116
Who does that?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.813
They said it was something
they'd really remember.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.206
Well, I'm sure they did.

36:05.250 --> 36:08.601
What I mean is,
who thinks like that?

36:08.644 --> 36:11.604
Well, me. So?

36:14.041 --> 36:17.958
Well, it seems you have some
good in you, Mr. Norris.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.395
You used that
vivid imagination

36:20.439 --> 36:22.832
of yours to go above and beyond

36:22.876 --> 36:27.228
what those old men could
possibly imagine.

36:27.272 --> 36:30.231
And in doing so, you gave them,

36:30.275 --> 36:33.060
pretty much, a last hurrah.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.409
Is this a trap?

36:36.803 --> 36:39.762
You will return
all the money you got,

36:39.806 --> 36:41.242
minus a reasonable salary.

36:41.286 --> 36:42.461
Agree to probation

36:42.504 --> 36:44.767
and two years
community service.

36:44.811 --> 36:47.727
Which you can work off
at the Last Hurrah,

36:47.770 --> 36:52.384
which will be run by
an outside agency, not you.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.647
No jail time?

36:54.690 --> 36:56.562
Well, if you don't
abide by the conditions,

36:56.605 --> 36:59.391
the charges will be
reinstated immediately.

36:59.434 --> 37:02.132
You will be looking at
a lengthy sentence.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.702
Don't blow it.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.880
Why are you doing this for me?

37:12.969 --> 37:16.277
Well, someone I know
and trust reminded me

37:16.321 --> 37:19.802
that sometimes people deserve
a second chance.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.683
I don't know what to say.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.119
Don't say anything.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.816
Probably be a lie anyway.

37:35.644 --> 37:39.082
Commissioner... thank you.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.786
And that pen you gave me
doesn't work.

38:05.892 --> 38:07.372
I'll have what
he's having.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.855
How'd you know
I was here?

38:12.899 --> 38:14.857
I followed the trail
of broken hearts.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.424
Very funny.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.905
You were right, Jack.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.386
You're a single man and you
can date whomever you want.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.344
I just thought you
could have given me

38:23.388 --> 38:24.693
the history before
I took the case.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.695
And would you have
rejected the case

38:26.739 --> 38:27.914
if I had told you?No.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.482
But I may have given
it to a junior A.D.A.

38:30.525 --> 38:32.484
So, in the future,

38:32.527 --> 38:34.529
if you need a favor for
someone you're dating

38:34.573 --> 38:36.836
or someone you
want to impress,

38:36.879 --> 38:38.707
maybe you can be a
bit more forthcoming.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.841
I will be more forthcoming.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.843
Actually, no, don't
ask me for favors

38:43.886 --> 38:46.759
for people you're dating
or you want to date.

38:46.802 --> 38:49.152
Okay, done.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.504
Is that it?

38:52.547 --> 38:54.506
The, uh, requests?

38:54.549 --> 38:56.116
No.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.378
Okay.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.380
Uh, what else
do I have to do?

38:59.424 --> 39:01.687
Have dinner with me.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.037
I can do that.

39:09.782 --> 39:11.914
I mean, go figure, the guy
actually helped some people.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.003
73, to be exact.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.353
Where are you
going with this?

39:15.396 --> 39:17.703
Mr. Norris has agreed
to a plea deal

39:17.746 --> 39:20.096
for community service
and probation.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.577
If he keeps his nose clean,
he won't do jail time.

39:23.796 --> 39:25.711
Which is the exact opposite
of what I asked.

39:25.754 --> 39:26.625
Sorry.

39:26.668 --> 39:27.713
Well, since when am I the man

39:27.756 --> 39:29.410
looking for
justice and retribution

39:29.454 --> 39:31.107
and you're the one
advocating leniency?

39:31.151 --> 39:32.979
Hey, it's your own fault;
that's what 16 years

39:33.022 --> 39:34.633
of Catholic school
will do to you.Well,

39:34.676 --> 39:36.678
didn't Catholic school teach you
to respect your elders?

39:36.722 --> 39:38.332
Oh, don't give me that.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.986
Frank, I asked for two things:

39:40.029 --> 39:41.553
that Norris pay for his crimes

39:41.596 --> 39:43.511
and that you keep it
out of the press.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.557
And I am keeping it
out of the press.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.474
And the archdiocese
is going to fold

39:49.517 --> 39:51.954
Last Hurrah
into its charity umbrella.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.303
We have enough charities.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.175
Oh, come on,
it's in the black, Kevin,

39:55.218 --> 39:57.395
and I can't think
of better publicity for you.

39:57.438 --> 39:58.483
And that's the end of it?

39:58.526 --> 40:00.528
And Norris stays on.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.269
He's not trustworthy.

40:02.312 --> 40:04.140
Well, he's a lost soul
in need of saving.

40:04.184 --> 40:05.490
Isn't that your guys'
bread and butter?

40:05.533 --> 40:07.883
That's a lot of asks.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.972
Well, I'm not done.

40:10.016 --> 40:13.454
Could you get me an audience
with the Pope?

40:13.498 --> 40:16.109
For my dad?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.459
Why wouldn't Henry
ask me himself?

40:18.503 --> 40:21.114
Because he'd never ask.

40:21.157 --> 40:23.116
And because it's a surprise.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.510
Ah.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.120
Well, you ask a lot.

40:27.163 --> 40:29.427
It's in giving that we receive.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.341
Oh, now you're gonna
quote St. Francis?

40:31.385 --> 40:32.821
He's as good a guy as any.

40:32.865 --> 40:35.476
Well, in that spirit,
congratulations, Frank.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.479
You have just been chosen
as the new chairperson

40:38.523 --> 40:40.568
of the Rikers Island
Pen Pal Committee.

40:40.612 --> 40:43.919
Come on, Kevin, those inmates
don't want to hear from me.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.486
Meetings are every
Monday at 8:00

40:45.530 --> 40:48.489
in St. Stephen's,
starting next week.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.230
See you then.

40:50.273 --> 40:52.188
God bless.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.857
Oh, Detective Reagan.

41:08.901 --> 41:10.642
Uh, do you want
to come in?

41:10.685 --> 41:12.078
No, no. Thank you.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.820
Just wanted you to know
we found Meredith's killer.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.517
In fact,

41:16.561 --> 41:18.519
I just dropped off the
locket to her mother.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.217
I'm happy that her family
will know the truth.

41:21.261 --> 41:22.784
Me, too.

41:22.828 --> 41:25.221
We have something
in common, you and I.

41:25.265 --> 41:26.614
We do?

41:26.658 --> 41:28.224
Mm-hmm.

41:28.268 --> 41:29.878
We both speak for the dead.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.271
Mm-hmm.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.708
Well, the leads you gave us
were very helpful.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.536
So, thank you for that.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.625
But you're still skeptical.

41:37.669 --> 41:41.673
Let's just say I...
prefer to stick to facts.

41:43.326 --> 41:46.678
Before, when I brought up your
wife's name, I'm so sorry.

41:46.721 --> 41:48.810
I didn't know that
it would hit such a chord.

41:50.769 --> 41:52.335
You know...

41:52.379 --> 41:54.947
Not for nothing, but everybody
knew about my wife's death.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.818
I mean, it was
all over the news,

41:56.862 --> 41:58.690
you could've looked it up.

41:58.733 --> 42:01.736
But I didn't.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.259
And she didn't die.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.655
She was murdered.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.746
I don't want your help.

42:11.790 --> 42:12.834
I have no interest

42:12.878 --> 42:15.271
in communicating
with the dead, okay?

42:16.795 --> 42:19.667
My wife knows
how much I love her.

42:21.713 --> 42:23.541
She says
she loves you more.
