<i>Sergeant ramsay, line 2232.</i>

02:04.524 --> 02:07.584
<i>Sergeant ramsay, line 2232, please.</i>

02:07.827 --> 02:09.727
- They want me.
- I've got this.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.864
Ramsay. What's the model?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.068
7799 agricultural?

02:20.039 --> 02:22.132
- Ramsay?
- What location?

02:22.976 --> 02:25.672
- This is marvin. Officer thompson.
- Nice to meet you.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.607
That's ramsay, your partner.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.315
Your new partner. Good luck with him.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.847
- Jack ramsay.
- Karen thompson.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.985
- I'm on my way.
- A runaway, jack?

02:34.220 --> 02:36.552
- Yeah. Can you order us a copter?
- Yeah.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.222
- Come on, partner.
- Now?

02:38.458 --> 02:40.323
If you're gonna keep up,
you gotta move.

02:40.560 --> 02:41.788
Give me the pad.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.723
I need a chopper for ramsay.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.633
You'll need your gloves
and standard pro-gs.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.268
Standard pro-gs?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.870
- What was your last assignment?
- Traffic.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.199
Did you like it?

02:55.475 --> 02:57.875
Working with you is
a step up from traffic.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.169
Maybe.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.071
You know anything about
robotics and computers?

03:02.315 --> 03:03.304
A little.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.539
Basics.

03:04.984 --> 03:08.249
I was gonna be a data programmer.
Do we need all this to...?

03:08.488 --> 03:10.615
- Jack, your copter's on the pad.
- Great.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.256
Let's go, partner.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.060
Is that it?

03:55.368 --> 03:59.668
Standard agricultural model
7799 pest controller.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.868
Cpu is an old 8088.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.167
- Any armament?
- Just a claw.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.470
It's only programmed to look
for things smaller than an inch.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.379
Could be a problem.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.454
You may not need all that.
You may just have to throw a switch.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.120
That's all?

04:19.892 --> 04:22.156
Well, you never know
until you get there.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.192
I guess you've been doing this
for a while?

04:25.431 --> 04:28.195
Yeah, a couple of years.
It's interesting work.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.026
Dave, how far away are we?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.761
Should be almost there.
Let's have a look.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.201
Right up there, jack.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.554
What do you know?

04:58.931 --> 05:01.729
It's a clear runaway track
in the field to the left.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.199
You okay?

05:04.437 --> 05:05.631
Yeah, i'm fine.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.771
I just don't like heights.

05:08.007 --> 05:10.305
My brother has the same problem.
Take deep breaths.

05:10.543 --> 05:11.510
I'm fine.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.803
Dave, can you land this sucker?

05:15.682 --> 05:16.774
Put on your gloves.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.460
They sure took long enough
to get here.

05:39.439 --> 05:43.000
- What's the problem?
- That thing's running a zigzag course.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.176
I'm not going in that field after it.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.470
Fuel cells will blow up
in your face.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.181
You go on and take a look.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.349
- Have you had it serviced?
- Regular.

05:54.721 --> 05:58.248
Isn't that what you're getting
paid for? You skedaddle in there.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.830
Oh, there you are.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.640
I seen that coming.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.215
You okay? Let's get him.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.225
World war iii!

07:08.461 --> 07:09.621
I think they got it.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.031
I could've done the same thing
with my.22.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.225
We could've blown the damn thing up.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.164
- It's all yours, fellas.
- Thanks a lot.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.506
How long you say
you've been doing this?

07:26.612 --> 07:29.206
I just sort of fell into it
by accident.

07:29.582 --> 07:34.144
I kind of liked it, so i took
some night courses in robotics, apl.

07:34.387 --> 07:38.221
All of a sudden, i just seemed to
know more about it than anybody else.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.521
You ever wanna work
the regular force?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.819
This is the regular force.

07:43.262 --> 07:46.322
You mean working the streets?
I did that. I had to stop.

07:46.566 --> 07:47.931
Because of vertigo?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.830
I don't like heights.
I've had it all my life.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.963
Anyway, i just decided
it wasn't a good idea...

07:55.208 --> 07:57.301
...to work the streets
with that kind of fear.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.344
You wouldn't run into
a situation like that very often.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.846
- You could work the streets...
- i decided i'd rather do this.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.449
Hey, jack, lois called.

08:06.686 --> 08:07.948
- Leave a message?
- Nope.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.382
- Can you call her back?
- Sure.

08:25.705 --> 08:26.865
Lois?

08:28.140 --> 08:30.665
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.907
Whatever you wanna fix is fine.

08:35.313 --> 08:36.941
Oh, that sounds good.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.215
I won't be late.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.414
Okay, bye.

08:47.226 --> 08:50.627
- Why did jack quit the regular force?
- Why'd he quit, marvin?

08:52.298 --> 08:53.356
What'd he tell you?

08:53.599 --> 08:55.897
Because of vertigo,
but i don't believe him.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.462
Well, it's true, in a way.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.733
A few years back,
jack was chasing this guy. Bad guy.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.841
The guy ran into a building
that was under construction.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.412
Jack freaked out, started sweating.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.016
Couldn't follow him.
The guy got away.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.344
So a guy got away.

09:15.821 --> 09:18.654
Later that night
that same guy killed six people.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.052
A family up in ridgemont.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.262
- But that isn't jack's fault.
- Yeah, i know.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.192
He can't blame himself for that.

09:26.432 --> 09:27.763
Yeah, well, he does.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.901
It's always on his mind.
The guy that got away...

09:31.137 --> 09:33.071
...that jack let get away.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.170
He never wants to let anybody
get away from him again.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.639
Is that why he's a robot expert?

09:38.878 --> 09:41.540
I think he feels a lot safer
doing this work.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.409
Now, why do you do
what you do?

09:44.650 --> 09:47.448
Oh, long story.
I was gonna be a dancer...

09:47.687 --> 09:48.745
...but i hurt my knee.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.047
Then i was gonna be
a data programmer...

09:51.290 --> 09:54.316
...but i didn't like sitting down.
Then i started...

09:54.560 --> 09:56.221
<i>runaway 2, we have a 709 alert.</i>

09:56.462 --> 09:58.020
- To the police academy.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.255
<i>Runaway 2, we have a 709 alert.</i>

10:00.499 --> 10:04.435
<i>Runaway 2, runaway 2,</i>
<i>we have a 709 at fifth and sumter.</i>

10:04.670 --> 10:06.069
What's a 709?

10:06.305 --> 10:07.704
It means people have died.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.339
Oh, god!

10:32.632 --> 10:33.860
- Hey, jack.
- What's up?

10:34.100 --> 10:37.297
A model 912 cut up two people inside,
wife and her sister.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.937
Bodies are over here. They managed
to run out before they died.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.109
- Anything else?
- There's a 10-month-old kid inside.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.244
- Dead?
- No. The kid's in a crib.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.108
Maybe that's why,
but it hasn't touched the kid yet.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.243
- We gotta save that kid, jack.
- Tell me.

11:00.893 --> 11:01.860
What was the weapon?

11:02.094 --> 11:05.120
Pathologist said it was probably
an ordinary kitchen knife.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.264
We kept them for you to see.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.264
Let's get them out of here,
or they'll be on the news.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.435
What've you done?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.367
Power cut, white light bath,
white sound bath.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.403
- Floater?
- No.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.575
- Can you prep one for me?
- Right now.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.072
What have you got on the 912?

11:19.311 --> 11:21.006
It's a new domestic model.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.772
Does housework, cooks meals,
answers doors.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.984
- Run on house current?
- Batteries.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.310
What kind of sensors?

11:27.553 --> 11:29.578
Sees and hears everything.

11:30.056 --> 11:30.852
Great.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.222
- Is it standard?
- May be modified.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.292
Anytime you change them,
who knows how they'll behave?

11:36.796 --> 11:39.993
The father's over there.
Electronic engineer, name of johnson.

11:42.902 --> 11:45.769
- You got that floater yet?
- We're programming it now.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.939
We'd like a direct feed
off your floater.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.007
- That's impossible.
- The public has a right to know.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.268
We got a 10-month-old baby in there.

11:53.512 --> 11:55.139
The rest of the family's
been cut up...

11:55.381 --> 11:58.316
...and we don't know if
the 912 will attack the child.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.543
I'm sure you don't want
a carved-up baby on your network.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.880
We can be the judge
of what's newsworthy.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.091
Yeah, i know. Not tonight.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.456
The first confirmation from
sgt. Ramsay of runaway...

12:10.696 --> 12:13.187
...that there is a baby inside,
still alive.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.559
Police are preparing
a floater camera...

12:15.801 --> 12:19.430
...to enter the house to locate
the runaway 912 and the infant.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.901
I can't see.
Lights on in the house.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.626
Hit the house lights.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.832
- Where's the baby?
- In the playroom, near the back.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.408
How big's this 912, anyway?

12:57.643 --> 12:59.668
About the size of a hatbox.

12:59.979 --> 13:01.310
- Look.
- It dropped the knife.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.310
Maybe the battery power's fading.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.811
Maybe.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.298
- You get an audio?
- Confirmed as a.357 magnum.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.130
- The bastard's got a gun.
- Now what?

13:24.470 --> 13:26.836
- I'm going in.
- We can send a disarm robot in.

13:27.072 --> 13:31.008
It hit the floater, it'll hit
the disarm, and it'll hit the kid.

13:31.243 --> 13:34.804
I want light lines out here.
No audio, no radio, no nothing.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.015
I don't want it to know
what we're doing.

13:37.683 --> 13:38.945
Mr. Johnson?

13:41.687 --> 13:43.120
Mr. Johnson?

13:43.923 --> 13:47.450
I'll be going in your house soon
to get your baby.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.318
What modifications were made
to the robot?

13:51.263 --> 13:54.596
I didn't make any modifications.
I didn't touch that thing.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.825
Then why has it gone out of control?

13:57.069 --> 13:58.661
Well, how should i know?

13:58.904 --> 14:02.772
You think i should have some idea
why it's doing this?

14:03.008 --> 14:04.839
Take it easy. I'm just asking.

14:05.077 --> 14:06.840
Well, don't ask! I don't know!

14:08.280 --> 14:09.679
What about the gun?

14:09.915 --> 14:11.644
It's got a gun?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.019
- Oh, my god, he's crazy.
- Who's crazy?

14:15.254 --> 14:17.449
- My god, he's crazy.
- Who's crazy?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.749
No television! No pictures!

14:19.992 --> 14:22.517
I won't be on television!
No pictures!

14:23.162 --> 14:24.561
No television!

14:24.797 --> 14:26.094
What was his problem?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.730
Yeah, he was really upset.
That was very hot stuff.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.617
Sgt. Ramsay is wearing
his electromagnetic scatter suit.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.446
He apparently is going in.

14:50.756 --> 14:52.519
What is your next move now?

14:52.758 --> 14:54.157
I really can't say.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.987
It looks as if you're going in
after the robot.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.164
You're broadcasting on an
electromagnetic frequency...

15:00.399 --> 15:01.696
...that the robot reads.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.737
Let's get out of here, john.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.054
This is exciting.
Our own john wilson...

16:04.296 --> 16:06.764
...is accompanying sgt. Ramsay
into the house...

16:06.999 --> 16:10.093
...for exciting live coverage
of the runaway robot.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.044
I'm coming out with the kid.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.956
It's all right, darling.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.123
You okay?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.984
Yeah, i'm fine.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.854
Here you go. Where's the father?

20:30.095 --> 20:31.653
He disappeared.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.796
He disappeared?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.098
With his own kid still in there?

20:36.935 --> 20:40.632
<i>After two tense hours and the</i>
<i>tragic death of a kbex cameraman...</i>

20:40.872 --> 20:42.999
<i>... it was all over</i>
<i>when sgt. Ramsay...</i>

20:43.242 --> 20:44.266
hello?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.302
That was great!

20:46.545 --> 20:50.072
See, they're running it again.
You're on instant replay!

20:50.849 --> 20:52.783
Hi, guy. Bobby, this is karen.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.816
- You're his new partner.
- Nice to meet you, bobby.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.989
I saw you on tv too,
but you didn't go in the house.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.692
Wow! It was neat when
dad went in there.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.760
I'll bet you wished you could
go in there too, huh?

21:05.130 --> 21:07.894
It was pretty scary.
I watched the whole thing.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.691
How come the father ran away?

21:09.935 --> 21:11.766
Didn't he wanna see his baby safe?

21:12.004 --> 21:13.494
We were talking about that.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.331
It seems pretty funny to me.

21:15.574 --> 21:16.700
I think you should...

21:16.942 --> 21:21.140
<i>when you hear the tone,</i>
<i>the time will be 10:45...</i>

21:21.813 --> 21:25.840
<i>... which is exactly one hour</i>
<i>and 45 minutes past your bedtime.</i>

21:26.084 --> 21:27.142
Aw, lois!

21:27.386 --> 21:30.355
<i>This is a weeknight.</i>
<i>Tomorrow is a school day.</i>

21:30.589 --> 21:32.318
- I know, lois, but...
- hey, bobby.

21:32.557 --> 21:34.354
Lois is right. To bed.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.552
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.764
- Do you like sports?
- Sure.

21:39.998 --> 21:41.465
Bobby, bed.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.962
- Good night, dad.
- Good night.

21:43.201 --> 21:44.429
Good night, bobby.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.133
He is adorable.

21:47.372 --> 21:50.205
- How about a beer?
- Got anything diet? Soda?

21:50.442 --> 21:54.344
<i>I will verify that bobby brushes</i>
<i>his teeth. Excuse me.</i>

21:54.579 --> 21:56.376
So that's lois.

21:56.615 --> 21:58.344
I thought lois was your wife.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.278
Sometimes she thinks she is.

22:00.519 --> 22:01.884
Or my mother.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.051
Do you have a wife?

22:05.424 --> 22:06.322
She died.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.752
Sorry, i didn't know.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.655
It was a couple of years ago.
A car crash.

22:11.263 --> 22:12.890
But lois is a big help.

22:13.198 --> 22:14.756
What is she, a series 10?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.331
No, a series 12.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.229
Series 12s are much better.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.268
A lot of the series 10s were lemons.

22:21.540 --> 22:25.306
My mom had a series 10 that kept
burning toast. Started fires.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.942
- Lois is pretty reliable.
<i>- Bobby is eating a chocolate bar.</i>

22:29.181 --> 22:31.649
<i>His dinner, too, was</i>
<i>nutritionally inadequate.</i>

22:31.883 --> 22:34.113
- What did you give him?
<i>- Hot dogs.</i>

22:34.353 --> 22:38.153
- You can't keep giving him hot dogs.
<i>- It is all he would accept.</i>

22:38.390 --> 22:41.587
- Did he do his homework?
<i>- Yes, he got an a in math today.</i>

22:41.827 --> 22:44.091
<i>- Will your guest be staying for dinner?</i>
- Me?

22:44.329 --> 22:47.890
- You're welcome if you'd like.
<i>- You are welcome if you would like.</i>

22:48.133 --> 22:49.225
No, thank you.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.459
- It's no trouble.
<i>- It is no trouble.</i>

22:51.703 --> 22:53.830
- Lois, i was talking to her.
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

22:54.272 --> 22:56.331
- Actually, i better go.
- You sure?

22:56.575 --> 22:57.701
Thanks for the juice.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.045
<i>May i show you out?</i>

23:01.279 --> 23:03.509
That's okay, lois.
I can find my way.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.680
Well, see you tomorrow.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.886
<i>- Will i see you tomorrow?</i>
- Lois, she was talking to me.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.952
Excuse me, sergeant.

23:11.189 --> 23:12.315
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.525
- Good night.
- Good night.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.896
<i>Is that someone to be put in memory?</i>

23:19.131 --> 23:21.565
Yes. She's my new partner.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.964
<i>- How should she be listed?</i>
- As karen. Or officer thompson.

23:26.204 --> 23:27.603
<i>Very well.</i>

23:28.273 --> 23:30.366
<i>There is a power surge</i>
<i>from bobby's room.</i>

23:30.609 --> 23:31.541
I'll handle it.

23:31.777 --> 23:35.440
<i>The next dinosaur giant is</i>
<i>brontosaurus, "thunder lizard."</i>

23:35.680 --> 23:39.116
<i>Like the other two giants,</i>
<i>she's a peace-loving plant-eater.</i>

23:39.351 --> 23:42.718
<i>She is not as heavy as</i>
<i>the brachiosaurus, but she does...</i>

23:44.389 --> 23:45.754
come on, tiger.

23:46.525 --> 23:47.787
Lights out.

23:52.130 --> 23:53.529
Is she still here?

23:53.765 --> 23:55.323
No, she's gone home.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.501
She's nice. Do you like her?

23:57.736 --> 23:59.260
Well, sure, i like her.

23:59.504 --> 24:00.971
She's my partner.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.867
Does she have a husband?

24:03.341 --> 24:04.433
I don't know.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.405
She didn't have a ring on.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.203
You noticed, huh?

24:08.547 --> 24:10.412
It wouldn't kill you
to marry again.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.708
I know, and it wouldn't kill you...

24:12.951 --> 24:14.646
...to go to sleep.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.251
Come on, tiger.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.282
- Hey, dad?
- What?

24:18.523 --> 24:20.821
Were you really scared in there?

24:21.626 --> 24:22.957
Sure i was.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.720
Was there blood and stuff like that?

24:28.366 --> 24:30.061
Were you really scared?

24:30.302 --> 24:32.395
Me? Not me.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.535
Not even just a little?

24:35.774 --> 24:37.469
Well, a little.

24:39.244 --> 24:40.472
That's okay.

24:40.712 --> 24:43.545
- But everything is fine now.
- That's right.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.376
Everything's fine.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.080
Good night, son.

24:52.924 --> 24:55.620
Would lois ever go crazy
like that other robot?

24:57.028 --> 24:58.620
No, never.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.124
Sleep now.

25:01.099 --> 25:02.088
Good night.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.098
<i>Dinner is served.</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:07.805
<i>This concludes the menu for today.</i>

25:08.039 --> 25:12.203
<i>Reminder: I have not received</i>
<i>the menu for tomorrow.</i>

25:15.347 --> 25:17.872
<i>Captain mcnichol, emergency phone call.</i>

25:19.818 --> 25:21.308
- Son of a bitch!
- What is it?

25:21.553 --> 25:23.646
We got a nonstandard chip here.

25:23.889 --> 25:24.821
See that red stripe?

25:25.056 --> 25:28.355
It's not a commercial chip.
It didn't come with the robot.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.161
Damn sophisticated, though.

25:31.396 --> 25:32.761
Maybe it's experimental.

25:32.998 --> 25:35.728
- What's it do?
- Looks like hard-wired instructions.

25:35.967 --> 25:39.232
- I'm not sure.
- So the 912 was modified.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.031
- Definitely.
- That guy said it wasn't modified.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.435
Maybe somebody else did it,
and he didn't know.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.074
- We got a dense pack! Floor!
- Floor!

25:53.718 --> 25:55.379
Assholes.

25:55.987 --> 25:59.479
<i>There is a high level of smoke</i>
<i>in the room. Please be careful.</i>

25:59.724 --> 26:00.713
What was that?

26:01.092 --> 26:03.185
Monodichromate dense pack...

26:03.361 --> 26:06.330
...the arson special.
What the hell is this all about?

26:07.132 --> 26:08.394
I don't know.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.531
This isn't a runaway.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.964
This is murder.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.468
Jack, you got a call.
You're gonna love it.

26:34.859 --> 26:35.883
Great.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.322
He said you were gonna love it.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.057
Come on, this way, guys.

26:43.301 --> 26:44.427
Careful.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.594
You have a lot of robots here.

26:46.838 --> 26:50.774
This is nothing. You should see
the construction project over on main.

26:51.009 --> 26:54.843
There aren't any people working there
at all, just hundreds of robots.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.444
No coffee breaks, no union hassles.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.309
So what's the problem?

26:59.985 --> 27:01.009
Stacker.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.583
Gone nuts!

27:02.887 --> 27:05.378
It's stacking where there's
no place to stack.

27:10.495 --> 27:13.191
It's on the 18th floor.
Come on, i'll show you.

27:17.402 --> 27:20.098
Have one of your people shut it off.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.570
Our insurance doesn't cover it.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.101
Looks pretty open.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.677
Robots don't need doors. Come on.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.308
How about i take this one?

27:37.455 --> 27:39.389
Yeah, i think this one's all yours.

27:39.624 --> 27:42.286
No problem. I worked construction
at one time.

27:43.962 --> 27:44.951
Of course.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.941
<i>I'm on the 18th floor.</i>

28:06.184 --> 28:08.084
<i>It's pretty windy up here.</i>

28:08.687 --> 28:11.281
<i>I can see the stacker now.</i>
<i>We're looking for...</i>

28:13.992 --> 28:17.189
<i>i found the junction box</i>
<i>but can't find the switch.</i>

28:18.063 --> 28:21.430
<i>I got it! No problem!</i>
<i>I turned it off!</i>

28:23.568 --> 28:25.399
<i>Jack, do you read me?</i>

28:27.706 --> 28:29.003
I got it!

28:37.682 --> 28:40.810
Think it's better than it was
when people did all this work?

28:41.052 --> 28:41.848
Sure.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.244
But machines always break down.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.855
I'll tell you how it is.
Nothing works right.

28:47.092 --> 28:49.287
Relationships and people
don't work right.

28:49.527 --> 28:52.724
People make machines,
so why should machines be perfect?

28:52.964 --> 28:54.454
Because they're machines.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.467
Well, that's not the way it is.

29:10.715 --> 29:12.376
- Hi, sally.
- Hi, jack.

29:12.617 --> 29:14.983
- How's the new car?
- It's in the shop.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.450
You're kidding.
Did you check the door recorder?

29:17.689 --> 29:18.678
No, not yet.

29:18.923 --> 29:21.357
- Is it clean in here?
- Yeah, it's clean.

29:27.899 --> 29:30.265
<i>Hi, mary. It's sally.</i>
<i>I guess you're not home.</i>

29:30.769 --> 29:33.738
<i>I came by to see if you wanted to</i>
<i>go to that ceramics class.</i>

29:33.972 --> 29:35.803
<i>Call me when you get in. Bye.</i>

29:40.445 --> 29:41.377
<i>Hi, dave?</i>

29:41.613 --> 29:44.309
<i>I'm a little nervous</i>
<i>about our project and...</i>

29:44.849 --> 29:48.046
<i>meet me at the office, will you?</i>
<i>It's important. Really.</i>

29:51.623 --> 29:53.989
<i>This is acme robot repairs.</i>
<i>We got a call...</i>

29:54.225 --> 29:56.853
<i>... that one of your 912s was not</i>
<i>functioning, and i'm...</i>

29:57.695 --> 29:59.128
it's been erased.

29:59.697 --> 30:01.289
Yeah, but not completely.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.237
<i>This is acme robot repairs.</i>
<i>We got a call...</i>

30:09.474 --> 30:12.568
<i>... that one of your 912s was not</i>
<i>functioning, and i'm...</i>

30:13.444 --> 30:15.435
i wanna know who this guy is.

30:23.188 --> 30:25.554
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.314
I'm glad you're satisfied.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.821
Satisfied?

30:29.060 --> 30:31.153
I'm delighted. I'm ecstatic.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.988
That's good. Good!

30:33.231 --> 30:34.357
Where are the chips?

30:38.136 --> 30:41.970
Be very careful with these chips,
dr. Luther. They're very dangerous.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.470
I know.
That's why they're so valuable.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.406
Valuable to whom?

30:46.644 --> 30:49.977
The mafia, terrorist organizations,
foreign agents.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.308
Anyone who'll offer me the most money.

30:52.951 --> 30:53.940
Well, then...

30:54.185 --> 30:55.675
...how about my money?

30:58.323 --> 30:59.347
Harry...

31:01.092 --> 31:03.083
...these aren't all the chips.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.722
And where are the templates
to make more?

31:06.898 --> 31:09.594
The rest of the chips and templates
are locked in a safe.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.828
We'll give you the key
after johnson and i get paid.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.698
Have you seen johnson?

31:14.939 --> 31:16.031
No.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.999
He didn't come in today.

31:18.243 --> 31:20.677
It's terrible,
what happened to his family.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.276
It's a tragedy.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.145
Would you like me to pay now, harry?

31:26.784 --> 31:28.183
I really would.

31:28.953 --> 31:31.786
I thought so.
I brought the money with me.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.017
Sentry, on rounds!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.167
Dr. Luther?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.751
Damned, evil son of a bitch!

32:31.449 --> 32:33.474
- He's still in there?
- Came an hour ago.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.016
I bet he's the only
electrical engineer there.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.916
- What room?
- 404. fourth floor.

32:43.761 --> 32:45.319
Coffee, black.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.564
Keep an eye on the elevator.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.382
Police!

33:12.623 --> 33:14.352
Drop it, johnson!

33:14.859 --> 33:16.053
Now!

33:23.401 --> 33:24.959
You are the cops.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.998
Who were you expecting?

33:27.238 --> 33:28.227
Nobody.

33:28.473 --> 33:31.442
You got a suitcase packed.
You got an alarm and a gun.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.166
You got a permit for this?

33:33.711 --> 33:34.700
Come on.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.438
What are you gonna do?

33:36.681 --> 33:38.945
Take you to the station
for questioning.

33:40.318 --> 33:41.342
Sorry.

33:42.220 --> 33:43.983
Is this about the robot?

33:44.255 --> 33:47.190
Yeah, it's about the robot.
Come on.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.160
- I can't go out there.
- Why not?

33:53.398 --> 33:55.161
- I can't go!
- Sure you can.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.095
I can't go out...!

34:11.815 --> 34:13.612
Dispatch, this is runaway 2!

34:57.995 --> 35:00.793
What the hell are you trying to do?
Come here.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.059
We're the police!

36:10.034 --> 36:12.935
He had different eyes, hm?
Is that him?

36:13.471 --> 36:15.371
Face was narrower.

36:16.407 --> 36:17.965
The eyes were squintier.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.273
More like that?

36:21.646 --> 36:22.874
Pretty close.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.275
That's a lot like him.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.348
That's good.

36:29.053 --> 36:30.213
Jesus!

36:42.767 --> 36:46.134
It's picking up diphenyl compounds
and tetrahydrocarbons.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.100
Tetras are explosive and diphenyls
are solid propellant...

36:49.340 --> 36:50.864
...like they use in rockets.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.378
How big did you say
these missiles were?

36:54.645 --> 36:55.907
About that big.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.842
And they went around corners?

36:59.517 --> 37:00.506
Who was this guy?

37:00.751 --> 37:03.549
His name's johnson,
electronic engineer.

37:04.121 --> 37:07.113
- Where did he work?
- A company called vectrocon.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.553
<i>Welcome to vectrocon</i>
<i>security systems.</i>

37:09.794 --> 37:12.627
<i>A retinal identification check is</i>
<i>required to proceed.</i>

37:14.932 --> 37:17.901
<i>Retinal identification is</i>
<i>now being carried out.</i>

37:18.135 --> 37:20.296
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

37:21.906 --> 37:24.397
<i>Retinal identification is</i>
<i>now confirmed.</i>

37:24.642 --> 37:26.109
<i>How can we help you?</i>

37:26.344 --> 37:27.436
I need data files.

37:27.678 --> 37:29.202
<i>Data files for what person?</i>

37:29.447 --> 37:30.641
Employee david johnson.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.872
<i>One moment.</i>
<i>I will search the records.</i>

37:33.117 --> 37:35.677
That's a pretty good voice.
What is it, a 5590?

37:35.920 --> 37:39.287
Yeah, it's a 5590 processor,
but with a z-77 phonetic rom.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.150
Gives it that lifelike tone.

37:41.392 --> 37:42.757
<i>Thank you for waiting.</i>

37:42.994 --> 37:45.326
<i>David "dave" johnson is 32 years old.</i>

37:45.563 --> 37:47.554
<i>He has been with the company</i>
<i>four years.</i>

37:47.798 --> 37:50.426
<i>A graduate</i>
<i>in electronic engineering.</i>

37:50.668 --> 37:52.533
<i>He has worked on several projects:</i>

37:52.770 --> 37:55.603
<i>The vectrocon security system,</i>
<i>the phantom missile...</i>

37:55.840 --> 37:57.899
<i>... and a laser-guided</i>
<i>smart bomb.</i>

37:58.142 --> 38:01.009
<i>For the past year, he has worked</i>
<i>in special projects.</i>

38:01.245 --> 38:04.214
<i>Dave enjoys skiing,</i>
<i>biking and water sports.</i>

38:04.448 --> 38:06.575
- It's a standard pr bio.
- What'd you expect?

38:06.817 --> 38:09.115
- It's no good to me.
<i>- It's what you requested.</i>

38:09.353 --> 38:10.183
What do you wanna know?

38:10.421 --> 38:12.685
This vectrocon security project.
What about that?

38:12.923 --> 38:15.391
<i>- That information is classified.</i>
- Keep quiet.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.186
<i>- Do you wish to disconnect?</i>
- How do i find out?

38:18.429 --> 38:21.125
- We have a call.
- Have another unit take it.

38:21.365 --> 38:23.162
Yeah, but our call is right here.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.698
- On my way.
- In this building?

38:24.935 --> 38:27.870
You wanna handle this?
It seems like we got a runaway.

38:38.549 --> 38:39.345
All right!

38:45.756 --> 38:46.882
<i>Hello?</i>

38:47.925 --> 38:49.222
<i>Anybody there?</i>

38:51.696 --> 38:52.856
Who is she?

38:53.097 --> 38:55.861
Jackie rogers, one of
the executive secretaries.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.263
<i>Hello? Can anybody hear me?!</i>

38:59.737 --> 39:02.797
We hear you, miss rogers.
This is sergeant ramsay.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.476
<i>Will you guys get me out?</i>
<i>This damn robot won't let me pass.</i>

39:06.711 --> 39:08.770
<i>He's zapped me twice.</i>
<i>Can you see that?</i>

39:09.013 --> 39:12.380
You just sit tight, miss rogers.
She's very attractive.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.411
- Should she be in there?
- Maybe she's working late.

39:15.653 --> 39:16.483
Let's see the runaway.

39:18.589 --> 39:20.022
A 577 sentry?

39:20.257 --> 39:23.920
Yeah, 577 with office-checking
routines onboard.

39:24.495 --> 39:27.157
Got it. Insulated wheels, steel hull.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.593
- Delivers taser shocks only?
- Standard issue.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.064
We don't modify them.
We run them as they come.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.396
Supposed to voice-inactivate
with a code.

39:34.638 --> 39:36.071
Do you know the code?

39:38.008 --> 39:40.704
Sentry. Input. Vetro.

39:40.945 --> 39:42.412
Zip off. 891. clipper.

39:42.646 --> 39:45.581
<i>I've already tried that.</i>
<i>It isn't responding.</i>

39:45.816 --> 39:48.478
With these sentries,
the temperatures get too high...

39:48.719 --> 39:51.347
...and they pop their chips
right off the motherboard.

39:51.589 --> 39:53.523
<i>Would you guys please do something?</i>

39:55.559 --> 39:58.392
All this thing can do is
deliver shocks? What level?

39:58.629 --> 40:00.995
Sting level only.
Irritating, but it can hurt.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.597
No bio, cardiac, nothing.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.427
Want me to get
the insulation and padding?

40:05.669 --> 40:08.137
- Are you sure?
- I'll knock this baby off quick.

40:08.372 --> 40:11.808
Miss rogers, this is sergeant ramsay.
I'll be right with you.

40:12.042 --> 40:13.339
You just sit tight.

40:13.577 --> 40:14.771
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:15.012 --> 40:17.913
I thought you got armed before
you went up against a runaway.

40:18.449 --> 40:19.575
I think he's in love.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.426
You just stay put, miss rogers.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.157
This will only take a minute.

40:37.334 --> 40:38.767
Better watch out for him.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.565
I think i know what i'm doing.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.969
<i>It's set for stun, not sting level.</i>

40:49.213 --> 40:50.475
I noticed.

40:50.714 --> 40:53.148
<i>- Want the padding now?</i>
- No.

41:07.231 --> 41:08.755
Are you all right, sergeant?

41:08.999 --> 41:09.795
I'm fine.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.655
- Is this the way you usually do it?
- Sure.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.012
What are you doing?

42:07.558 --> 42:08.889
You didn't have to do that!

42:09.126 --> 42:10.650
Judgment call.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.829
It was a new jacket.

42:13.063 --> 42:16.032
Yeah, but the sentry's ruined.
I'll have to report this.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.758
If i find there's any irregularities...

42:19.003 --> 42:22.495
...we'll shut down all your machinery
as hazardous for 60 days.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.901
- Are you okay, miss rogers?
- I'm fine.

42:25.142 --> 42:27.872
- I'll just see you to the door.
- No, it's fine.

42:28.112 --> 42:30.080
- I insist.
- You've done enough.

42:30.314 --> 42:32.077
It's my duty. Here you are...

42:32.316 --> 42:33.943
...working late all by yourself.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.448
- I just had to finish up.
- I insist.

42:36.687 --> 42:38.552
- Let me help you.
- No, really...

42:46.697 --> 42:48.164
- what's this?
- It's not my fault.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.594
- He made me get them from the vault.
- Who?

42:50.834 --> 42:51.630
Luther.

42:51.869 --> 42:55.066
They're his chips! I don't have
anything to do with this.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.002
He said he would kill me if
i didn't get them tonight!

42:58.242 --> 42:59.539
He would kill me the way...

42:59.777 --> 43:03.474
...he killed johnson and the others.
He's evil, i'm telling you!

43:03.714 --> 43:04.908
Where's this luther now?

43:05.783 --> 43:07.080
- A meeting.
- What meeting?

43:07.318 --> 43:09.980
- I don't know! I'm not involved...
- where is he?!

43:13.958 --> 43:15.653
The ritz hotel.

43:21.899 --> 43:23.332
<i>Ritz hotel.</i>

43:23.601 --> 43:24.898
The presidential suite.

43:25.135 --> 43:26.830
Two guys with him and two girls.

43:27.071 --> 43:30.507
They've got an evs scrambler on,
so we can't hear or see shit.

43:30.741 --> 43:31.935
Where exactly are they?

43:32.176 --> 43:35.509
Can't determine where without
a probe, and they'll pick that up.

43:35.746 --> 43:37.839
- You using passives only?
- Passives only.

43:38.082 --> 43:41.813
- All the exits and elevators covered?
- We don't have enough people.

43:42.219 --> 43:45.188
This guy's a killer.
I'm not gonna let him get away.

43:45.823 --> 43:47.552
Something's going on in there.

43:47.825 --> 43:50.350
- I better go in.
- You taking responsibility?

43:53.797 --> 43:54.855
You okay about this?

43:55.099 --> 43:56.760
- Yeah, fine.
- You sure?

43:57.001 --> 43:59.367
It's more interesting than traffic.

44:01.071 --> 44:03.733
I'm gonna go in first
and when you hear me...

44:03.974 --> 44:05.168
...you come in.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.648
Honey, did i leave my purse out there?

44:56.960 --> 44:59.588
Did i leave my purse out there or not?

45:01.198 --> 45:03.098
Are you listening to me?

45:04.568 --> 45:06.092
He's not even there.

45:12.476 --> 45:14.910
Don't shoot, please.
Please don't shoot.

45:15.145 --> 45:15.941
Come on, now.

45:17.481 --> 45:18.505
Nobody move.

45:18.749 --> 45:20.114
Nobody move.

45:22.152 --> 45:25.087
Just stay cool.
Everything's gonna be fine.

45:25.322 --> 45:27.347
You said there wouldn't be trouble.

45:27.591 --> 45:28.387
Nobody move.

45:30.127 --> 45:31.253
Right here.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.796
Okay, let's take it easy.

45:35.032 --> 45:38.195
Everybody move real slow,
and we won't have any trouble.

45:55.986 --> 45:57.476
Drop it, sucker.

46:01.458 --> 46:03.085
I said, "drop your gun."

46:06.697 --> 46:08.324
I'm not kidding, asshole.

46:08.565 --> 46:10.396
Drop your gun.

46:10.868 --> 46:12.426
Please.

46:25.582 --> 46:27.447
Now kiss your ass goodbye!

46:36.193 --> 46:37.626
Police! Hold it!

46:40.864 --> 46:41.796
I'm okay. Get him.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.400
- Where?
- The stairs!

46:45.636 --> 46:48.434
Officer down, inside.
Call for backup.

47:02.252 --> 47:03.651
<i>They're on the roof!</i>

47:40.157 --> 47:41.784
It's all right. It's all right.

47:42.025 --> 47:43.253
You're okay.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.169
The coroner's office has authorized
the removal of the bodies.

47:56.406 --> 47:58.271
- Come on.
- She's a witness, billy.

47:59.743 --> 48:02.371
- Sergeant, may we have a word with you?
- Go away.

48:03.113 --> 48:03.909
Later.

48:04.147 --> 48:05.341
I want to talk to you.

48:05.849 --> 48:07.339
Chief, any further comment?

48:07.584 --> 48:09.916
No, there's no comment right now.

48:10.354 --> 48:12.049
- How is it, kid?
- Fine.

48:12.289 --> 48:14.484
Didn't even break any bones.

48:14.858 --> 48:18.487
I'm going to the hospital.
They'll take the bullet out there.

48:18.729 --> 48:19.559
Take it out there?

48:19.796 --> 48:22.094
That's right, in case
she starts bleeding.

48:22.332 --> 48:23.890
But you can't move her.

48:24.134 --> 48:24.930
Hold on a minute.

48:25.168 --> 48:26.533
Come here.

48:29.306 --> 48:32.070
Take a look at that screen again.
That's not a bullet.

48:32.309 --> 48:35.574
It's an unexploded microshell.
It can go off anytime.

48:35.812 --> 48:38.474
- It can blow her whole arm off...
- that's right.

48:38.715 --> 48:41.047
You gotta take it out here.
Don't move her.

48:41.285 --> 48:43.480
- The chief wants your ass.
- I know.

48:49.059 --> 48:50.993
Just sit tight.
It's gonna be fine.

48:51.228 --> 48:52.661
I'm trying not to breathe.

48:52.896 --> 48:54.158
You do that.

49:02.439 --> 49:03.804
Look at this. Look.

49:04.041 --> 49:06.737
Those two dead hoods?
We got a make off the prints.

49:06.977 --> 49:10.140
Tommy aracaro, degree in
electrical engineering, cal tech.

49:10.380 --> 49:11.574
- Great.
- And...

49:11.815 --> 49:14.716
...luigi bandini, degree in
solid state physics, m.i.t.

49:14.952 --> 49:18.285
These guys are high-tech shoppers.
But what are they buying?

49:18.522 --> 49:19.420
Good question.

49:19.656 --> 49:21.180
Now, ramsay!

49:23.593 --> 49:25.185
Get over here, ramsay.

49:26.563 --> 49:29.794
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- It's my operation.

49:30.033 --> 49:32.968
It's a runaway operation?
No runaways in that room.

49:33.203 --> 49:36.695
You screwed up good. We've got
two dead officers, understand?

49:36.940 --> 49:38.407
Two dead cops!

49:38.642 --> 49:40.735
Two wounded, one of them
your own partner.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.775
We got two dead guinea punks!

49:43.013 --> 49:45.379
And nobody knows what it's all about!

49:45.615 --> 49:47.981
I know what it's about.
It's about this.

49:48.218 --> 49:49.014
What is this?

49:49.252 --> 49:51.914
It's some kind of new bullet,
like a guided missile.

49:52.155 --> 49:55.124
It can go...
what the hell is this?!

49:55.359 --> 49:57.554
Disarm robot.
There's an unexploded fragment.

49:57.794 --> 49:59.557
You can't use that thing on her!

49:59.796 --> 50:02.264
- They sent for it.
- They screw up all the time.

50:02.499 --> 50:06.060
- We have to. It's a live shell.
- It'll screw up!

50:06.536 --> 50:08.128
It'll blow her arm off.

50:08.372 --> 50:10.670
- Can't you get a cvd?
- There's none available.

50:10.907 --> 50:13.603
It's over a year old and,
they were never any good!

50:13.844 --> 50:16.335
Jesus christ, you've got
nerve to complain!

50:16.580 --> 50:18.980
Haven't you done enough for one day?

50:20.484 --> 50:22.645
- I'll get the bullet out.
- You?

50:22.886 --> 50:25.514
I'll disarm the goddamn bullet.
Get it out of here!

50:25.756 --> 50:28.088
All right, clear out.
We've got a disarm job.

50:28.325 --> 50:30.816
Clear out!
Can you get them to clear out?

50:31.061 --> 50:33.723
I want tensolite shields!
I want blast pads!

50:33.964 --> 50:35.898
I want to clear the fucking room now!

50:36.133 --> 50:37.691
Ramsay! You're on television.

50:37.934 --> 50:40.801
I don't give a shit.
Get that thing out of my face.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.437
Get out. Clear it out!

50:42.672 --> 50:45.266
Ladies, i'll give you
a statement down here.

50:45.509 --> 50:46.999
Let's go. Get out!

50:47.344 --> 50:50.142
Yes, i will give
the public a statement.

50:56.953 --> 50:57.977
What's this?

50:58.221 --> 50:59.279
Remote tv.

50:59.523 --> 51:00.820
<i>Of course.</i>

51:02.025 --> 51:03.720
<i>Okay, guys, let's clear out.</i>

51:10.200 --> 51:11.827
Better get away from the door.

51:27.751 --> 51:30.049
- How we doing, kid?
- Okay.

51:31.221 --> 51:33.451
I heard the news.

51:35.725 --> 51:37.283
Well, don't sweat it.

51:39.196 --> 51:40.561
You don't have to do this.

51:41.665 --> 51:42.461
Yeah, i know.

51:42.699 --> 51:45.998
- You can let the robot do it.
- I wouldn't miss this for the world.

51:51.441 --> 51:53.136
Just hold real still.

52:00.050 --> 52:02.211
- Too tight?
- No, it's okay.

52:11.261 --> 52:13.593
I want you to sit back
and take it real easy.

52:14.397 --> 52:15.796
It'll hurt like a mother.

52:20.871 --> 52:23.840
Just real easy.
Just turn your arm.

52:25.408 --> 52:26.807
Real slow. That's it.

52:27.711 --> 52:28.507
That's good.

52:32.015 --> 52:33.505
Okay, whatever you do...

52:34.784 --> 52:35.944
...don't move your arm.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.883
I'll try and remember.

52:44.594 --> 52:46.687
Don't you need your glasses for this?

52:48.565 --> 52:50.795
Want me to run to the car
and get them?

52:56.039 --> 52:57.472
Breathe it, kid.

52:58.675 --> 52:59.573
Hold still!

53:01.077 --> 53:02.601
Come on kid, breathe it.

53:03.146 --> 53:06.445
That's it. Just keep breathing.
Hold still.

53:08.151 --> 53:09.311
That's it.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.878
Come on, kid.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.179
Breathe it. That's it.

53:14.424 --> 53:15.584
Easy.

53:24.234 --> 53:26.361
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

53:26.603 --> 53:28.571
Can't you do anything right?

53:28.805 --> 53:30.329
I'm doing the best i can.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.039
This thing's gonna be okay.

53:35.278 --> 53:37.075
Heard any jokes lately?

53:39.082 --> 53:39.878
Come on, kid.

53:40.850 --> 53:43.876
Hold on. Come on, hold still.

53:44.421 --> 53:45.217
Breathe it.

53:45.455 --> 53:46.786
I can see it.

53:49.025 --> 53:50.049
Come on.

53:51.328 --> 53:52.727
I can see it.

53:53.029 --> 53:54.428
It's almost there.

53:55.198 --> 53:56.256
Come on.

54:00.003 --> 54:01.027
There!

54:14.884 --> 54:16.078
It's okay.

54:26.396 --> 54:28.591
You didn't need to wait, jack.
I'm fine.

54:28.832 --> 54:31.528
- I was worried about you.
- I'm fine, really.

54:32.002 --> 54:34.129
- Hurt much?
- No. Not really.

54:34.371 --> 54:35.736
Bet it does.

54:35.972 --> 54:38.133
Jack, i'm fine.

54:39.242 --> 54:40.971
Why don't we have dinner tonight?

54:41.211 --> 54:42.269
Dinner?

54:42.812 --> 54:45.007
Sure. I gotta go home
and change, though.

54:45.248 --> 54:48.308
- You can go like that.
- I can't go like this.

54:48.551 --> 54:49.848
We're going to my place.

54:54.457 --> 54:57.324
- We should get to know each other.
- I love it.

54:58.795 --> 55:02.026
It's a good idea for partners
to spend time together...

55:02.265 --> 55:04.756
...away from work.
- Definitely. You're right.

55:05.001 --> 55:07.128
We'll go over office routines...

55:07.370 --> 55:08.632
...station procedures.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.237
There's a lot of things
you'll need to know.

55:12.709 --> 55:15.371
The chief isn't the easiest guy
to get along with.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.441
I always take new partners to dinner.

55:19.082 --> 55:19.878
Oh, you do?

55:20.317 --> 55:24.515
Just because you're a woman
shouldn't make any difference, right?

55:26.122 --> 55:29.285
Well, listen, i really
appreciate the gesture...

55:29.526 --> 55:31.960
...but i want to go home.
- Why not dinner?

55:35.999 --> 55:36.795
Just forget it.

55:55.819 --> 55:58.515
<i>The pasta will be al dente</i>
<i>in two minutes...</i>

55:58.755 --> 55:59.983
<i>... 17 seconds.</i>

56:00.223 --> 56:01.019
Forget it, lois.

56:01.257 --> 56:03.350
<i>- Where's your dinner guest?</i>
- Forget it.

56:03.593 --> 56:04.582
<i>She forget it?</i>

56:04.828 --> 56:07.422
She didn't forget it.
I'm asking you to forget it.

56:07.664 --> 56:09.894
<i>Very well, i will erase it</i>
<i>from memory.</i>

56:10.133 --> 56:10.997
You do that.

56:11.468 --> 56:14.369
<i>Bobby stayed up to say</i>
<i>good night to you.</i>

56:25.715 --> 56:26.704
Dad.

56:26.950 --> 56:28.247
Hi, son.

56:28.985 --> 56:31.078
I saw you on tv.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.217
I know you didn't mean it.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.428
- Mean what?
- What you said.

56:39.662 --> 56:43.063
The words that you said
that you say i can't say.

56:45.869 --> 56:47.996
- Well, you see...
- i know.

56:48.238 --> 56:52.800
You didn't know what you were saying,
because you were worried about her.

56:53.476 --> 56:55.000
Well, that's true.

56:55.311 --> 56:57.404
But that's not an excuse.

57:00.417 --> 57:04.012
- Sometimes...
- just don't let it happen again.

57:08.558 --> 57:09.820
I'll try.

57:10.727 --> 57:12.854
Did she come here tonight?

57:15.331 --> 57:16.730
No, she went home.

57:16.966 --> 57:20.561
<i>Excuse me, sergeant.</i>
<i>They want you at the police station.</i>

57:23.773 --> 57:25.138
I gotta go.

57:28.244 --> 57:29.802
You go to sleep.

57:30.213 --> 57:32.613
- Good night, son.
- Yes, sir.

57:35.285 --> 57:36.547
Good night.

57:56.906 --> 57:59.204
<i>Vehicle recovery on three-six.</i>

57:59.943 --> 58:00.967
Look at this.

58:01.211 --> 58:02.974
The back half is solid propellant.

58:03.213 --> 58:06.478
There's directional control.
The nose is electronic.

58:06.716 --> 58:10.982
You've heard of a bullet that has your
name on it? This one really does.

58:11.221 --> 58:13.280
- You can program it.
- What's its signature?

58:13.523 --> 58:17.220
I don't know. I've tried everything.
Movement, light, shape.

58:17.460 --> 58:19.223
- I gotta know, marvin.
- I know!

58:19.462 --> 58:21.521
I'm doing my best, okay?

58:22.031 --> 58:23.430
It's tricky.

58:29.472 --> 58:30.530
Heat.

58:31.474 --> 58:32.736
My god.

58:33.276 --> 58:36.211
- A heat-seeking missile.
- They come at a specific person.

58:36.446 --> 58:37.538
Sure.

58:37.780 --> 58:41.147
Everyone's body has its own unique
heat pattern. This is yours...

58:41.384 --> 58:42.783
...and this is mine.

58:43.720 --> 58:45.688
Clean, simple and neat.

58:49.392 --> 58:51.087
This is a police nightmare.

58:51.327 --> 58:54.455
We used to worry about terrorists
getting a-bombs?

58:54.697 --> 58:57.063
The real problem is
microelectronics stuff.

58:57.300 --> 58:58.562
I mean, a smart bullet?

58:58.801 --> 59:00.063
What about these chips?

59:00.303 --> 59:04.262
Overrides all cpu instructions.
Turn any computer into a killer.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.935
Charles luther. This the guy?

59:09.178 --> 59:10.440
Yeah, that's him.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.147
This is a bad guy.

59:12.382 --> 59:15.909
Served one to three, robbery.
Arrest, murder two, no conviction.

59:16.152 --> 59:20.782
Arrest for assault with a deadly
weapon, overturned. Mob connections.

59:21.024 --> 59:23.584
He's a rich kid gone bad.
Why's he with johnson?

59:23.826 --> 59:26.761
He got johnson and harry to design
the chips, killed them...

59:26.996 --> 59:28.861
...and ran away with the stuff.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.363
He likes to kill people.

59:31.601 --> 59:34.126
He's killed five so far. I want him.

59:34.504 --> 59:37.405
I'm sure you do.
But how are you going to get him?

59:37.640 --> 59:39.540
We've got his girlfriend.

59:39.776 --> 59:43.212
Whoop-dee-do! You think he's
interested in a piece of ass?

59:43.446 --> 59:46.609
- She's all we've got.
- And she leads nowhere.

59:46.950 --> 59:48.713
I want you to talk to our psychic.

59:49.552 --> 59:53.511
Linda's in the building. I'll send
her up here to give you a reading.

59:53.756 --> 59:56.316
- Come on, chief.
- Just do it, ramsay.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.500
Louis...

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.209
an old name.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.981
Lucifer.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.349
Luther?

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.280
Is his name luther?

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.755
And you're looking for him.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:29.825
He's very angry.

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.185
Where is he?

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.952
I'm not surprised you're
looking for him.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:37.722
You have a karmic bond.
You were brothers in another life.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:42.131
- Linda...
- your relationship is clear, like...

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.203
...pieces in the same puzzle.

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:48.677
You've been close many times,
and you'll get closer.

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:50.936
You'll definitely meet.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.440
When and where?

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.316
He'll see to that.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.319
After all...

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.723
...you have what he wants.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:04.954
- I do?
- Of course.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:09.932
- I work as an exercise instructor.
- Where?

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.634
A lot of places.
Look, i got a firm body.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:15.133
My body's perfect. It's like a rock.

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.531
I can see that.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.035
Oh, come on.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.374
He's giving me a hard time.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.635
- He doesn't believe me.
- I can't help.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.141
Weiner-head!

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.905
<i>Officer milhop, artist sketch room.</i>

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.978
Called you back too, huh?

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.148
How are you feeling now?

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.920
Hurts, but it's okay.

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.422
- Hey, ramsay. Telephone.
- I'm not here.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:39.459
What's going on?

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:46.363
Those illegal chips look like
they were production-etched.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:47.499
Meaning what?

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.965
They were run off
a regular assembly line.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:53.171
- So?
- Somewhere there's photo templates...

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.899
...to make more.

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.376
Who has the templates?

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.638
I don't know. We better find them.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.783
He said he knows you're here.
Do you know a luther?

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:14.596
This is ramsay.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:18.358
<i>You're lucky to be alive.</i>
<i>You should've let the robot disarm it.</i>

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:22.594
- So you watch tv. What's on your mind?
<i>- I watch, i look, i listen.</i>

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.272
<i>I'm watching you now.</i>

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:26.634
Right. What's on your mind, luther?

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.471
<i>You're standing by the desk</i>
<i>punching buttons on the console...</i>

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.772
<i>... trying to trace this call,</i>
<i>which won't...</i>

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:36.314
<i>... do shit, because i'm calling</i>
<i>from a mobile phone.</i>

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.383
<i>Now you're looking around.</i>

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:41.419
<i>Now you're cupping your hand</i>
<i>over the receiver.</i>

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.784
He's tapped into
the closed-circuit tv.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:48.429
<i>I can't hear what you're saying,</i>
<i>but i've tapped into the tvline.</i>

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:50.562
<i>That wasn't very nice, ramsay.</i>

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.131
How'd he do that?

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.359
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>how i did that.</i>

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.405
- What do you want?
<i>- I want my girl.</i>

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:01.208
<i>I know she's there.</i>
<i>I want you to turn her over to me.</i>

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:02.273
No way.

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:06.312
<i>If you don't, i'll kill her.</i>
<i>And then i'll kill you.</i>

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:09.313
<i>You can't run away, ramsay.</i>
<i>I'll find you.</i>

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.180
<i>My little machines will</i>
<i>find you wherever you go.</i>

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.860
- Why's he want the girl?
- Maybe she has the templates.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.964
- Marvin, can you get me a little bug?
- Yeah, i got it for you.

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.269
You were supposed to catch him.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.733
And how are you?

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.968
- You were supposed to catch him!
- I tried.

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.646
Well you didn't, shithead!

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.371
I feel bad about it too.

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:43.779
Not half as bad as i do.
You really screwed up.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.488
He got away.
You know where that leaves me?

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:47.950
He's smart, you know?

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:51.991
He's gonna know how you found him
at the hotel room because i told.

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:54.219
And he's gonna be so mad...

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.965
what am i gonna do now?

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.791
- We'll take care of you.
- Sure you will.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.628
We'll move you to a safe place.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:05.102
You'll move me to a safe place?
And where is that?

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.241
There is no safe place.
Not from him.

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:10.036
- Sure there is.
- No, there isn't!

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:12.213
What does it take to get
through to you?!

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.939
He sees everything.
He knows everything here.

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.744
Do you understand
what i'm saying to you?

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.512
Why is he looking for you, jackie?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.127
How do i know?

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.996
We better move you.

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:39.366
<i>Beginning debug scan.</i>

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:50.919
<i>Scan complete. No bugs detected.</i>

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:55.848
<i>Beginning debug scan.</i>

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:05.158
<i>Scan complete. No bugs detected.</i>

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.831
- Purse, jackie.
- Not again.

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:10.504
- Come on.
- I'm clean.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.002
We'll see.

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.603
<i>Beginning debug scan.</i>

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:20.506
<i>Bug detected.</i>

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.377
Give me your blouse, jackie.

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:37.059
Nice.

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:43.501
<i>Resuming scan.</i>

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.233
<i>Bug detected.</i>

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:50.672
Give me your bra.

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:00.622
<i>Resuming scan.</i>

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.791
<i>- Bug detected.</i>

<i>Resuming scan.</i>

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:10.622
<i>Bug detected.</i>

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:14.327
- Got a lot of bugs.
- I thought i was clean.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.798
You're loaded.

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.702
He really wants to keep track of you.
Why is that?

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.512
- These two are clean.
- Okay, fine.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.050
Are you crazy?
These are police cars.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.351
- You want a four-car escort?
- Just you.

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.755
We'll take the robot driver.
You ride shotgun.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.464
Is that gonna be enough?

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:45.792
Hell, no! If we're in cop cars,
they'll catch on right away.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:48.026
- Oh, i doubt that.
- You doubt that?

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:52.263
You're acting like sir galahad.
You're gonna get us all killed.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.665
Where's the templates?

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:56.909
What templates?

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:01.706
Let's get moving. Come on.

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.647
We hit the streets, and you,
me and dollface are dead.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.286
Hey, jack, you need a hand?

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.114
Just don't touch the cars, rudy.

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:12.225
- Come on, it's me, rudy, your buddy...
- don't touch the car!

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.156
- Come on, i'm clean.
- Back off!

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:50.763
It's luther.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.731
Yeah, could be.

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.083
- You reading?
<i>- Very clear.</i>

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.115
- Armed?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:14.921
- What do you think our chances are?
- I'm not worried.

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.148
Yeah, well, you should be.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:21.658
<i>Internal screens are activated.</i>

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.191
Clear so far.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.562
<i>No electronic targets are shown.</i>

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:29.669
Set up.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:32.339
Okay. Pull back a little.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:34.064
Get the lock-on ready.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.845
Lock-on. Armed.

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:45.484
- Front or rear?
- Rear.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.131
<i>- A lock-on is tracking.</i>
- Shit!

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:01.336
In progress.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.769
- It's all yours.
- Got it.

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:11.444
<i>A lock-on is targeted.</i>

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:22.216

<i>- Lock-on closing.</i>
- From the front.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.223
<i>200 yards.</i>

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.970
You are crazy. You're both crazy!

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:41.240
<i>A lock-on is tracking.</i>

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.444
<i>Conditions are serious.</i>

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.423
Damn, how many you got?

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.422
- Five. Six.
- Bail out.

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:00.060
Moving in.

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:02.696
- What's happening?
- We're getting out.

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.857
<i>Multiple lock-ons targeted</i>
<i>at less than 200 yards.</i>

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:08.898
<i>Conditions are dangerous.</i>

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.671
<i>Multiple lock-ons targeted</i>
<i>at less than 100 yards.</i>

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.371
Come on! Jump!

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:23.084
<i>Multiple lock-ons targeted</i>
<i>at less than 50 yards.</i>

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:30.957
<i>Multiple lock-ons are closing.</i>
<i>Conditions dangerous.</i>

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:37.292
<i>Take evasive action.</i>

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.807
<i>Lock-ons are closing.</i>

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.278
They're still tracking!

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:59.646
- They're keyed on.
- Whatever it is, it moved with you.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.283
- Jackie.
- Come on, you know i'm clean.

01:11:03.525 --> 01:11:04.787
Six coming front and rear.

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:09.758
We're never gonna make it.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:14.902
- Jackie!
<i>- Lock-ons targeted at 100 yards.</i>

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:16.896
All right! Just a minute.

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:20.575
<i>Eighty, seventy, sixty...</i>

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.743
<i>... fifty, forty, thirty...</i>

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.378
go ahead. Throw it!

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:27.578
<i>Conditions...</i>

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:29.507
<i>... are hopeless.</i>

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.327
That did it.

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.960
The templates?

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.956
Do you know how much they're worth?

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:46.030
Luther wants them pretty bad.

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:49.499
- Yeah, he does.
- And i want luther pretty bad.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:52.505
What do you say we make
a public appearance?

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:04.016
<i>You want sushi?</i>

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:05.379
Two california rolls.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.518
You're out of your mind to stand here.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.283
- Why, where is he?
- He could be anywhere.

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:14.528
That doesn't do us much good, does it?

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.425
This is stupid!
You think he's gonna show up here?

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.930
He won't.
Let's get out of here.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.798
- He wants these. He'll come.
<i>- Sushi is here.</i>

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.902
See, doesn't that look good?

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.335
You had the <i>tekka maki.</i>

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:35.480
<i>Let me speak to her, ramsay.</i>

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.148
Where are you?

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.880
<i>Don't be an asshole.</i>
<i>I'm like you, having dinner.</i>

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:44.382
<i>You might say, a night on the town</i>
<i>with your partner.</i>

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.051
<i>Come on, come on, hurry up.</i>

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:51.929
<i>Officer thompson was nice enough</i>
<i>to lend me her headset.</i>

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.228
<i>Move a little, dear,</i>
<i>so he can see the gun.</i>

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.200
<i>Take a seat with jackie.</i>

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.199
Come on.

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.353
<i>- Two for dinner?</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.047
This way, please.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.355
<i>Be cool.</i>

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:23.730
<i>We don't want any shooting</i>
<i>in a place like this, do we?</i>

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:26.399
- No.
- Good boy.

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:31.305
- Just don't get too nervous.
- I won't.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.098
I beg your pardon, sir?

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:34.832
Nothing. This is fine.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:38.410
<i>All right, now give jackie</i>
<i>the templates.</i>

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.247
Would you like something from the bar?

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:45.316
Nothing, thank you.

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:49.255
- I'll be back with the menus.
- Could you give us a few minutes?

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.557
<i>Now send jackie over to me.</i>

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:54.222
Send thompson first.

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:57.224
<i>What's the matter, sergeant?</i>
<i>Don't you trust me?</i>

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:01.329
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>i haven't got all night.</i>

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.430
It's my insurance policy.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.412
Send thompson.

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:12.409
<i>At the same time.</i>

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:14.080
Go ahead, jackie.

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.175
<i>Good bye, darling.</i>

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.839
Sweet dreams.

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.104
<i>Do you think i'm stupid?</i>

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.680
What's the matter?

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.646
These aren't all of them.

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.344
Nobody does that to me.

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:53.520
Nobody!

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.300
So he got away.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.007
And he stiffed the girl.

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:47.401
- That's right.
- That's good.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:50.009
That's excellent work. What's next?

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:51.041
Nothing.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.975
- Can't screw that up.
- Nothing...

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.183
...because i planted a bug on him.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.113
- We'll pick it up anytime now.
- You hope.

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:00.718
What is it?

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.584
- They got a signal from the bug.
- Where?

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:06.123
City hospital. He must have got hurt.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.425
Got enough people here?
They'll pick you up.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.463
- Where is he?
- In the john.

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.931
Clear those civilians out. Let's go.

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:19.000
You stay here.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.352
Where the hell did he go?

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:36.783
Sally!

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:57.177
Congratulations. You just
staked out toilet paper.

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:01.744
Go through the usual routines.
Maybe we'll find something.

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:03.577
We'd better go.

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.751
You wanna watch the door?

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.083
Sure.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.277
Where's the chief?

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.619
Where'd you get those idiots
for the stakeout?

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.915
- It was amateur night.
- We blew it.

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.956
I'll say you did.
We should have had him.

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:54.719
You didn't find him, huh?

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:57.592
He's good.

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.793
You better look at this.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:12.543
Oh, god.

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:18.148
It's busy.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:23.885
Bobby!

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:28.488
Lois?

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.629
What happened?

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.664
Her voice module's broken.

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.100
See if you can patch it.

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.669
Wasn't she watching the door?

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.936
Don't try to speak, lois.

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:46.409
- She's lost hydraulic fluid.
- She's okay...

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:49.082
...if she keeps power to
her memory circuits.

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:50.776
<i>Bobby.</i>

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.782
<i>- Bobby.</i>
- Hit the reset.

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.115
Lois?

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:02.026
<i>Bobby was on the phone when an</i>
<i>unpleasant man came in the back door.</i>

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:03.128
What about bobby?

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:05.499
<i>He forced bobby to leave with him.</i>

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.926
- How long ago?
<i>- My clock's disconnected.</i>

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:11.537
<i>- I do not know the amount of time.</i>
- Did he say anything?

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.468
<i>He left no...</i>

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:16.771
let me see that.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.306
I'm really sorry.

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:19.873
<i>I am really sorry.</i>

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:22.675
<i>Dinner will not be</i>
<i>painted in time.</i>

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:27.385
<i>- We're not here to answer your call.</i>
- I can't get it patched.

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:29.623
<i>May i show you to the door?</i>

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.890
I think that's it.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:36.324
- Lois, do an internal diagnostic check.
<i>- Beginning check now.</i>

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.035
What'd you do with my son?

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:48.568
<i>Listen, sucker.</i>

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.038
Yeah, i'm listening.

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:54.112
<i>If you wanna see your boy alive,</i>
<i>bring the other templates.</i>

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:57.182
<i>Just you alone. No tricks this time.</i>

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:58.878
Where?

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.315
I'll be there.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:02.686
Where we going?

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.323
- Alone.
- I'm your partner.

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.890
He'll know if you come.

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.059
I'll wait in the car.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:10.856
Listen! He'll know.
I'm not taking any chances with bobby.

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:13.060
Where you gonna meet him?

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.501
You promise not to follow me?

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.401
I promise.

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:20.204
- And you won't call anybody?
- I won't.

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.549
<i>Diagnostic check completed.</i>

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.013
<i>There is a malfunction.</i>

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:35.087
<i>- Please check battery connections.</i>
- Sure.

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.321
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.085
- Is this it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:43.360
<i>What'd you do with my son?</i>

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:44.963
<i>Listen, sucker.</i>

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.167
<i>Yeah, i'm listening.</i>

01:21:46.401 --> 01:21:49.859
<i>If you wanna see your boy alive,</i>
<i>bring the other templates.</i>

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:51.663
<i>Just you alone.</i>

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:54.373
<i>- No tricks this time.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:57.967
<i>Where?</i>

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.578
<i>Go down main street to...</i>

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:03.715
<i>- right to sentises</i>
<i>construction site.</i>

01:22:24.339 --> 01:22:27.172
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>the spiders won't hurt you!</i>

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:32.138
<i>Dad? Are you coming to get me?</i>

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.405
<i>Better have the templates this time.</i>

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.412
- I do.
<i>- Drop your gun.</i>

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.651
<i>Now get on the elevator!</i>

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.844
Come on, ramsay!

01:24:28.596 --> 01:24:30.860
Let him go. Now!

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.063
Of course.

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:41.705
Get on the elevator.

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:43.974
I want to stay with you, dad.

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:45.611
Get on the elevator, son.

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.212
Push the down button.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.117
Stay away from the edge!

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:00.417
The templates, ramsay!

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.657
After he's down.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:04.893
After he's safe.

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:09.794
There's a little problem about that.
I can't have any witnesses.

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:14.873
The spiders have been programmed to
kill the first one off the elevator.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.974
They'll let you in.

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:19.680
But they won't let you out.
There's nothing you can do!

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.108
Bobby!

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.580
Stop the elevator!
Push the button!

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.410
What's the matter?!

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:27.951
Stop the elevator!
Push the button!

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:31.018
They don't work!

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.954
None of them work!

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:36.129
You can't stop it.
I fixed the elevator.

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.465
Look on the monitor.
It's a better view.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.500
Ever see them kill somebody?

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:52.372
It's really impressive.
They're loaded with acid.

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:08.559
Karen!

01:26:12.767 --> 01:26:13.563
Come on, kid.

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.081
You bastard!

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.075
That's good, ramsay.

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.520
But not good enough.

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.113
Enjoy the view?

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.205
It's okay, son.

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:46.745
It's okay.

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:52.288
Thanks.

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:57.760
You all right?

01:33:58.099 --> 01:33:59.464
Yeah, i'm okay.

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:19.075
You go to the car.

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:21.043
Tell lois you're all right.

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:37.857
You look awful.

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:44.066
I think i've overcome
my fear of heights.

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:47.602
- Hurt much?
- No, i'll get it taken care of.

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:49.643
How about dinner?

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:54.946
Dinner?

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.274
Sure.

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:05.548
Just because you're a woman
shouldn't make a difference, right?

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:07.294
Right.

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:24.773
Can you cook?

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:27.339
Try me.
