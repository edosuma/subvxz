WEBVTT

00:12.411 --> 00:14.412
Here's to surviving
the holidays.

00:14.479 --> 00:16.480
To Bloody Marys.

00:19.639 --> 00:21.818
And pumping and dumping.

00:21.886 --> 00:23.521
Right, my little
buzzy wuzzy buzzkill?

00:25.524 --> 00:27.391
Dad said you guys are
ironing things out.

00:27.459 --> 00:29.326
Yeah. Trying to, at least.

00:29.394 --> 00:31.695
Looks like Christmas wasn't
such a bad idea after all.

00:31.763 --> 00:33.397
You're welcome.

00:33.465 --> 00:37.068
God, this drawing
almost ruined everything.

00:37.135 --> 00:39.470
It's weird.
Mom said it was yours,

00:39.538 --> 00:41.672
but I swear
I remember drawing it.

00:41.739 --> 00:43.907
No. No, she's right.
That's one of my drawings.

00:43.975 --> 00:46.743
Yeah.

00:46.811 --> 00:48.779
Um, are you gonna
let Wilfred in?

00:48.846 --> 00:50.606
He's just gonna keep
scratching if you don't.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.683
I'm gonna pee.

00:55.753 --> 00:58.456
What are you doing?
Just letting the world know

00:58.523 --> 01:01.225
what a versatile guy you are.
"A little bit country,

01:01.293 --> 01:04.095
a little bit rock 'n' roll"?
So, what did Kristen say

01:04.162 --> 01:07.364
- about the drawing? - I was just asking her
about it when you interrupted me.

01:07.432 --> 01:09.567
I'm gonna have to sand
and repaint this.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.068
Dude, it's a compliment.

01:11.136 --> 01:12.869
I'm basically saying
you're Kid Rock.

01:14.906 --> 01:16.840
My cab's here.
I'm gonna get a bikini wax,

01:16.908 --> 01:19.577
and I want to still be a little
buzzed when the lady rips it.

01:19.644 --> 01:22.879
Uh, oh, hey, real quick.
Um, I-I was just wondering.

01:22.947 --> 01:25.616
Who's that character?
Oh!

01:25.683 --> 01:28.252
That's Mr. Floppy Ears.
It was just a silly

01:28.320 --> 01:30.154
imaginary character I used to draw.
Oh.

01:30.222 --> 01:31.755
H-How'd you come up
with him?

01:31.823 --> 01:33.357
I don't know.
I probably made him up.

01:33.425 --> 01:35.058
It's what most kids do.

01:35.127 --> 01:37.094
Kind of reminds me of Wilfred.

01:38.563 --> 01:40.197
You know,
you talk about Wilfred more

01:40.265 --> 01:42.433
than most people talk
about their neighbors' dogs.

01:42.501 --> 01:45.736
- I guess I just... - Nobody talks about
their neighbors' dogs, Ryan.

01:52.844 --> 01:54.678
Thanks.
What? It's not finished.

01:54.746 --> 01:57.014
"Ryan is a little bit

01:57.081 --> 01:58.949
chiseled."
It's true.

01:59.017 --> 02:00.151
You look good.

02:00.218 --> 02:01.552
Have you been working out?

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.663 --> 02:13.864
Oh. It's for my Instagram.

02:13.931 --> 02:15.599
If all my friends

02:15.667 --> 02:17.568
don't see a photo
of every single meal I eat,

02:17.636 --> 02:19.170
they'll probably start
to think I'm weird.

02:19.237 --> 02:21.557
Although, since Jenna and Drew
cut me off from people food,

02:21.573 --> 02:24.408
it's pretty much been
the same photo.

02:24.476 --> 02:26.810
So Kristen was a dead end, huh?
Pretty much.

02:26.878 --> 02:29.647
I mean, she thinks
she drew the drawing.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.682
"Mr. Floppy Ears."

02:31.749 --> 02:35.486
Then again, I saw myself doing
it in my memory from therapy.

02:35.554 --> 02:37.555
Well, maybe it would help
to give it a rest for a while.

02:37.622 --> 02:39.323
You know, distract yourself.

02:39.391 --> 02:40.924
We could play a game.

02:40.992 --> 02:43.860
Um..."Balderdash"?
"Scattergories"?

02:43.928 --> 02:46.129
You think that would help?
Well, it's like

02:46.198 --> 02:47.698
the pill in the cheese.

02:47.765 --> 02:49.266
Once a month, Jenna wraps

02:49.334 --> 02:51.835
these heartworm pills,
which I hate,

02:51.903 --> 02:54.071
in cheese, which I love.

02:54.138 --> 02:55.506
I could never solve the problem

02:55.574 --> 02:57.274
of how to eat the cheese
but not the pills.

02:57.342 --> 02:58.942
Until one day,

02:59.010 --> 03:00.678
I go outside
and I have a little game

03:00.745 --> 03:02.713
of Growly Stick Tug with Drew.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.482
I come back in,
and then suddenly...

03:05.550 --> 03:07.284
inspiration struck.

03:07.352 --> 03:09.720
What did you do?
Well, I started stashing the pills

03:09.787 --> 03:11.922
between my lips and gums.

03:13.091 --> 03:15.492
That's disgusting.

03:18.796 --> 03:20.063
I just wish there was
some other way

03:20.131 --> 03:22.132
to get more information
about that drawing.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.902
Nice. I already got 17 likes
on my latest Instagram.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.838
All my peeps are bugging out

03:27.905 --> 03:30.341
'cause now they know
what my meal looked like.

03:30.408 --> 03:31.542
Your peeps?

03:31.610 --> 03:33.477
Wilfred, you don't have any...

03:34.646 --> 03:35.946
Bruce.

03:37.148 --> 03:38.449
What about Bruce?

03:38.516 --> 03:39.716
He's known you for a long time,

03:39.718 --> 03:41.285
right?

03:41.353 --> 03:43.254
Plus, he's a part of this.

03:43.321 --> 03:44.988
Wh-What if he knows something?

03:45.056 --> 03:46.990
No, Ryan, Bruce
cannot be trusted.

03:47.058 --> 03:50.494
He's a snake.
Well, sure, he's a little shady, but...

03:50.562 --> 03:52.796
N-No, I mean he's
literally a snake.

03:52.864 --> 03:55.232
You know,
like a hissing, slithering...

03:55.300 --> 03:57.368
snake.

03:57.435 --> 03:58.969
What snake thing is that?
You know,

03:59.036 --> 04:00.471
when you catch a snake
and you try to eat it

04:00.538 --> 04:01.739
but it bites the inside
of your mouth

04:01.806 --> 04:02.973
and it makes
your cheek swell up.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.309
Like...
No.

04:05.377 --> 04:07.978
- And I've seen Bruce.
He's definitely not a snake. - Oh.

04:08.045 --> 04:10.013
Because snakes don't walk around
on two legs

04:10.081 --> 04:11.815
and have opposable thumbs
and talk to you.

04:11.883 --> 04:13.284
Kind of like dogs, right?

04:13.351 --> 04:14.818
But most importantly,

04:14.886 --> 04:17.353
have you ever seen Bruce alone
in a room

04:17.422 --> 04:20.591
with a mongoose?
Stop playing mind games with me.

04:20.659 --> 04:22.660
What if I started
messing with your head?

04:22.727 --> 04:26.062
Oh, my... Oh... I'm sorry.

04:26.130 --> 04:28.899
That is the cutest thing
I've ever heard.

04:31.235 --> 04:32.770
You are adorable!

04:32.837 --> 04:34.772
I'm the master of mind games.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.373
That's what I do.

04:36.441 --> 04:37.874
No one mind-rapes people
like I do,

04:37.942 --> 04:39.410
least of all...

04:39.477 --> 04:42.212
Shit, there's someone
at the front door.

04:54.158 --> 04:56.026
Okay, that is
the weirdest thing ever.

04:56.093 --> 04:57.828
There's no one there,
but clearly

04:57.895 --> 04:59.496
there was a knock on the front door.

04:59.564 --> 05:01.498
There's someone
at the door again.

05:13.044 --> 05:14.911
Ryan?

05:16.080 --> 05:17.681
Bruce?

05:18.883 --> 05:21.985
Shit.

05:22.053 --> 05:24.020
Well, it's quite a surprise,
you just showing up

05:24.088 --> 05:25.656
out of the blue like this, Ryan.

05:25.724 --> 05:27.524
Sorry, I-I just thought...

05:27.592 --> 05:29.092
What? That I had
murdered

05:29.160 --> 05:30.527
an elderly couple?

05:30.595 --> 05:32.062
Was living in their house,

05:32.129 --> 05:34.465
cashing their
Social Security checks?

05:34.532 --> 05:36.199
I mean, I get it, Ryan.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.635
I mean, I give off
that vibe, don't I?

05:38.703 --> 05:40.036
No.

05:40.104 --> 05:43.440
Deb and her daughter
have taken me in like...

05:43.508 --> 05:45.843
family.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.778
Hey, they look nice.

05:47.846 --> 05:50.213
They are nice.

05:50.281 --> 05:52.549
They're away at a Christian
retreat this weekend.

05:52.617 --> 05:54.785
If you're here to visit,

05:54.853 --> 05:56.219
your shoes have to come off.

05:56.287 --> 05:58.589
Deb's rule.

05:58.656 --> 06:00.724
I got your address off
of Wilfred's phone.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.260
I was actually surprised that
we live so close to each other.

06:03.327 --> 06:04.995
Did Wilfred send you over here?

06:05.062 --> 06:07.664
H-He doesn't know I'm here;
I swear.

06:07.732 --> 06:10.033
Well, he must've
really pissed you off, huh?

06:10.101 --> 06:11.635
Let me guess.

06:11.703 --> 06:14.070
He had you kick
your cousin's kid in the face

06:14.138 --> 06:17.207
with a running start, didn't he?
What? No.

06:17.275 --> 06:19.009
He didn't have me do that either.
Look,

06:19.076 --> 06:22.012
I-I tracked you down
because I have some questions.

06:22.079 --> 06:24.748
I-I was hoping that we could...
Is this

06:24.816 --> 06:26.349
crayon-related?

06:26.418 --> 06:28.251
Yeah.

06:28.319 --> 06:30.521
I knew this day
was gonna come, Ryan.

06:31.756 --> 06:32.756
Are you familiar

06:32.824 --> 06:34.758
with the concept of wormholes?

06:34.826 --> 06:35.959
Like...

06:36.027 --> 06:37.594
time travel?
Yeah.

06:37.662 --> 06:39.596
Like time tr...

06:39.664 --> 06:41.732
You know what?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.867
I think I've said
too much already.

06:43.935 --> 06:45.903
This is a bad idea. I think you should leave.
No, no.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.905
No, I-I need to know.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.607
H-How long has Wilfred
been in my life?

06:50.675 --> 06:52.008
Why is he in my life?

06:54.111 --> 06:56.713
Are you sure you're ready
for those answers, Ryan?

06:56.781 --> 06:57.781
Yes.

06:57.849 --> 07:00.617
Well, there's gonna be a price.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.787
I want Wilfred's testicles.

07:03.855 --> 07:06.289
Really?
Look, you know as well as I do

07:06.357 --> 07:08.224
that Wilfred's aggressive.

07:08.292 --> 07:10.093
He won't stop
till he gets what he wants,

07:10.161 --> 07:12.295
usually at our expense.

07:12.363 --> 07:15.398
He's a bad dog. Bad dog!

07:15.467 --> 07:18.301
And how do you take
a dog's aggression away?

07:21.272 --> 07:22.739
Isn't there something else I could...
I want

07:22.807 --> 07:24.808
his balls, Ryan.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.848
What are you reading?

07:38.916 --> 07:40.211
Um...

07:40.472 --> 07:42.306
Eyes up here, mate.

07:42.374 --> 07:45.676
Just... reading
an article.

07:45.743 --> 07:47.744
Sorry. Pardon me.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.680
Pardon. Whoa.
Can you just move?!

07:49.747 --> 07:52.616
Hey. What's going on?

07:52.684 --> 07:53.651
Are you okay?

07:54.852 --> 07:56.587
I went and saw Bruce.

07:57.789 --> 07:59.089
Damn it, Ryan!

07:59.157 --> 08:00.857
I told you he's bad news!

08:00.925 --> 08:02.526
I'm sorry.

08:02.594 --> 08:04.361
B-But, listen...

08:04.429 --> 08:07.331
I-I think he might actually know
something about you and me.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.965
Something big.

08:09.033 --> 08:10.634
How big?

08:10.702 --> 08:13.737
Like..."where you came from" big.
And I assume

08:13.805 --> 08:16.607
that dirty prick wants something
in return for it.

08:16.675 --> 08:18.141
Yes.

08:18.210 --> 08:19.710
A-And I should've
told you earlier.

08:19.777 --> 08:21.345
And-and I swear,
I-I was never actually

08:21.413 --> 08:22.613
gonna do anything.
Spit it out.

08:22.614 --> 08:24.948
Spit it out, mate.

08:25.016 --> 08:27.017
He wants your testicles.

08:27.085 --> 08:30.421
The family grape seeds?

08:30.488 --> 08:32.655
Okay. Well,

08:32.724 --> 08:35.458
if it's balls Bruce wants,

08:35.527 --> 08:38.061
then it's balls
Bruce shall have.

08:38.129 --> 08:40.831
Are you familiar
with Vincenzo's Gourmet Meats?

08:40.898 --> 08:42.899
That place on Rose?

08:42.967 --> 08:44.901
They make a specialty meatball

08:44.969 --> 08:48.405
that happens to look identical
to a dog testicle.

08:48.473 --> 08:52.309
Tender veal,
ground pork sausage,

08:52.377 --> 08:55.912
slivers of fried garlic and
the slightest hint of paprika.

08:55.980 --> 08:59.250
Mmm. They sound delicious.

08:59.317 --> 09:01.084
It doesn't matter
what they taste like.

09:01.152 --> 09:04.421
All that matters is what they look like.
Stop it!

09:04.489 --> 09:06.490
This is just another one
of your mind games.

09:06.558 --> 09:07.958
What are you talking about?
You saw

09:08.025 --> 09:10.261
how focused I was
on the drawing, so you got Bruce

09:10.328 --> 09:11.995
to trick me into thinking
he could help.

09:12.063 --> 09:14.998
All because Jenna stopped
letting you eat people food.

09:15.066 --> 09:17.134
If I was working with Bruce,
why wouldn't I just ask Bruce

09:17.201 --> 09:19.470
to buy the meatballs for me?
Oh, wait,

09:19.537 --> 09:22.239
I'm sure you have the perfect
explanation for that, too.

09:22.307 --> 09:26.443
Uh, because Bruce and I
are both banned from Vincenzo's.

09:26.511 --> 09:27.844
Yeah, that's it.

09:27.912 --> 09:29.380
Mate...

09:29.447 --> 09:31.014
I'm on your side.

09:31.082 --> 09:32.349
And I'm telling you,

09:32.417 --> 09:34.518
I know Bruce.

09:34.586 --> 09:36.887
And I know my testicles.

09:36.954 --> 09:39.189
This will work.

09:40.425 --> 09:43.394
Hmm.

09:43.461 --> 09:45.596
So I'm thinking we should
maybe get three meatballs.

09:45.664 --> 09:46.963
You know, in case we drop one.

09:47.031 --> 09:48.265
Why not four?

09:48.333 --> 09:50.734
Totally. Better
to be safe than sorry.

09:50.802 --> 09:53.136
Maybe we should just get a dozen.
Dude, seriously, it's like

09:53.204 --> 09:54.838
you're reading my mind
right now.

09:54.906 --> 09:57.508
By the way, this is the longest
way ever to Vincenzo's.

09:57.575 --> 09:59.443
Wait, we're not near
Vincenzo's.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.844
Ryan, what's going on?

10:00.912 --> 10:03.079
Sorry, Wilfred, but this
is the only way.

10:03.147 --> 10:05.949
Ryan?! Ryan!

10:06.017 --> 10:08.018
Ryan!

10:08.085 --> 10:09.586
You weren't kidding.

10:09.654 --> 10:11.689
- He's a handful.
- Ryan!

10:11.756 --> 10:13.390
He put up quite
a fight at first.

10:13.458 --> 10:14.958
But after we sedated him,

10:15.026 --> 10:16.794
the ear cleaning
couldn't have gone smoother.

10:16.861 --> 10:19.229
Thanks, Doctor.

10:30.408 --> 10:33.410
Who's the master
of mind games now?

10:42.787 --> 10:44.722
Shh...

10:44.789 --> 10:46.423
What's happening?
Shh.

10:46.491 --> 10:47.891
Oh.

10:47.959 --> 10:50.728
You're okay, Wilfred. Shh.

10:50.795 --> 10:53.831
No. No, no, no!

10:53.898 --> 10:59.336
No...!

10:59.404 --> 11:01.572
It was the only way, Wilfred.

11:01.639 --> 11:04.441
Well, I couldn't risk
missing out on answers--

11:04.509 --> 11:07.043
<i>the</i> answers-- for some
meatball switcheroo.

11:07.111 --> 11:10.347
Ryan, you idiot,
there were never any answers!

11:10.415 --> 11:11.682
But Bruce said...

11:11.750 --> 11:13.183
Bruce was lying!

11:13.251 --> 11:15.919
He was in it
for the meatballs, same as me!

11:15.987 --> 11:18.255
Vincenzo banned us
from the deli,

11:18.322 --> 11:21.224
just like I told you
sarcastically.

11:22.861 --> 11:26.563
Oh, my beautiful,
little poppy seeds.

11:26.631 --> 11:29.165
Wilfred, listen, I...

11:29.233 --> 11:31.334
How could you do this to me?

11:31.403 --> 11:35.372
I mean, sure, Bruce and I
were mind-gaming you, but...

11:35.440 --> 11:37.908
this is worse than anything
I ever did to you.

11:37.975 --> 11:41.879
I know. That-that's why I...
And I've done some awful, awful things to you.

11:41.946 --> 11:43.380
Registering you

11:43.448 --> 11:45.248
as a sex offender
in the state of Oregon?

11:45.316 --> 11:47.885
Putting fake blood stains
on the ass of your shorts

11:47.952 --> 11:50.287
just before you go bike riding?

11:52.957 --> 11:55.793
You <i>have</i> done some
awful, awful things to me.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.260
But this!

11:57.328 --> 12:00.130
Everything else pales
in comparison.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.265
I know.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.868
I'm really sorry it
turned out this way.

12:04.936 --> 12:06.670
No, it's okay.

12:08.272 --> 12:09.807
Now that I have no balls,

12:09.874 --> 12:13.310
it's kind of hard
to stay angry at you.

12:13.377 --> 12:15.746
I've heard that some dogs,

12:15.814 --> 12:19.650
once they're neutered,
they start to... change.

12:19.717 --> 12:22.519
Do you think I will change?

12:22.587 --> 12:24.020
It's possible.

12:24.088 --> 12:26.323
Oh!

12:26.390 --> 12:28.559
God, I hate it
when I get like this.

12:28.626 --> 12:30.894
My emotions are just,
like, all over the place.

12:33.130 --> 12:35.999
No, no, no. The doctor said
to wait at least 24 hours.

12:38.269 --> 12:40.871
Oh, shit! I forgot
this toy store was here.

12:40.939 --> 12:43.039
Sorry. God, it must be tough

12:43.107 --> 12:45.275
to look at all these fresh,
untouched stuffed animals

12:45.343 --> 12:46.910
now that your sex drive's gone.

12:46.978 --> 12:49.212
I-I'd take you inside, but...

12:51.315 --> 12:53.684
This bag is majorly cute, Ryan.

12:53.751 --> 12:55.719
I can totally see
you carrying that

12:55.787 --> 12:59.122
with my head sticking
out the top of it.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.557
Hey, you!

13:00.625 --> 13:01.959
You look good.

13:02.026 --> 13:03.727
Did you lose weight?

13:03.795 --> 13:06.396
We're totally hanging out
for brunch soon, okay?

13:06.464 --> 13:08.799
She is so fat.

13:08.867 --> 13:12.268
Wilfred, don't you want to check
out that toy store back there?

13:12.336 --> 13:15.873
Uh, yuck! My ears are, like,
totally having a bad moment.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.876
Okay, I really think
you should come see that store.

13:18.943 --> 13:20.343
Wow.

13:20.411 --> 13:23.213
Seriously, it's
moments like this

13:23.280 --> 13:24.748
that I'm glad I no longer
have testosterone.

13:24.816 --> 13:27.551
Men are from Mars.

13:29.353 --> 13:31.354
Everyone knows
store lighting can't be trusted,

13:31.422 --> 13:33.382
especially when you have
a non-traditional figure.

13:33.391 --> 13:34.992
So, try it on now.

13:35.059 --> 13:37.494
Ew, I'm not changing
in front of you.

13:37.562 --> 13:39.029
Wilfred, I have to tell you something.
Wait.

13:39.096 --> 13:41.337
Come tell me if you think
this sweater is totally fierce.

13:41.365 --> 13:42.599
And be honest!

13:44.035 --> 13:45.969
Wilfred?

13:52.744 --> 13:54.477
Oh, fabulous.

13:54.546 --> 13:56.312
You're awake.

13:56.380 --> 13:57.681
So...

13:57.749 --> 14:00.116
All numbed up, are we?

14:00.184 --> 14:01.785
What the hell is going on?!

14:01.853 --> 14:03.720
Shh, relax. See,

14:03.788 --> 14:05.856
the thing is, well, as
you know, I've changed.

14:05.924 --> 14:07.724
For the better, I think.

14:07.792 --> 14:11.261
But you're still the same
old macho, manly man.

14:11.328 --> 14:15.732
And if we're gonna stay
best friends, well...

14:15.800 --> 14:17.067
I'm sorry, Ryan.

14:17.134 --> 14:19.502
Wilfred, let me go!

14:19.571 --> 14:21.638
We're gonna be such bitches!

14:25.190 --> 14:27.505
No, no, no, no, no! Wilfred, I
didn't really have you neutered!

14:27.625 --> 14:29.225
Everything you're feeling,
is only psychosomatic!

14:29.292 --> 14:32.161
But you did have my ears
cleaned, which is bad enough.

14:32.936 --> 14:36.004
Wait. So, you...

14:36.072 --> 14:37.473
Of course I knew.

14:37.541 --> 14:39.074
I warned you, Ryan.

14:39.142 --> 14:41.444
Never try to mind-game
the master.

14:41.511 --> 14:45.414
Not to mention, pretending
to neuter your best friend?

14:45.482 --> 14:48.384
That's like the worst thing
a guy can do to another guy.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.085
Not cool!
But you started it!

14:50.153 --> 14:52.154
It doesn't matter! You
punched me in the nuts!

14:52.222 --> 14:54.189
Which reminds me.

14:54.257 --> 14:56.225
Oh, come on!

14:56.292 --> 14:58.394
You got me harder
than I got you!

14:58.462 --> 14:59.962
Aah!

15:00.029 --> 15:02.297
Oh, what is this,
a dick punch fight?

15:02.366 --> 15:03.932
Oh, God!
Oh!

15:04.000 --> 15:06.635
Look at us, Ryan.

15:06.703 --> 15:09.004
At each other's throats, messing
with each other's heads.

15:09.072 --> 15:11.206
How did it come to this?

15:11.274 --> 15:13.376
Or more importantly,

15:13.443 --> 15:15.644
who would want it
to come to this?

15:15.712 --> 15:17.847
Bruce.
Bruce.

15:17.914 --> 15:20.182
God, it all makes sense.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.085
He knew we'd start
mind-gaming each other.

15:23.152 --> 15:24.487
I bet he's laughing
his ass off right now.

15:24.554 --> 15:26.856
So, this was all just a game.

15:26.923 --> 15:28.257
He totally played us.

15:28.324 --> 15:29.692
Not yet.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.494
This game's not over.

15:33.129 --> 15:35.230
Come on in, Ryan.

15:35.298 --> 15:37.600
I'm surprised
you got here this soon.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.702
We got to do this quick.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.236
Deb just ran out to get Tammy

15:41.304 --> 15:43.372
at oboe practice.
They're coming back here,

15:43.440 --> 15:45.041
we're gonna watch
<i>Biggest Loser</i> together.

15:45.108 --> 15:47.710
Are you okay, buddy?

15:47.778 --> 15:50.613
Oh, Wilfred and I sort
of had a little fight.

15:50.680 --> 15:51.881
Did you now?

15:51.948 --> 15:53.582
Wow. That's a shame.

15:53.650 --> 15:56.419
Two amigos fighting like that.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.053
Well, here they are.

15:58.121 --> 15:59.522
I got them.

15:59.589 --> 16:01.424
I didn't think
you had it in you, Ryan.

16:01.491 --> 16:05.260
Whoa!

16:05.328 --> 16:08.297
You be sure and tell Wilfred
he can come over here

16:08.364 --> 16:11.534
any time he wants and take a look at these.
Actually...

16:11.601 --> 16:13.736
there was a complication
with the surgery.

16:13.804 --> 16:16.238
What kind of complication?
He...

16:16.306 --> 16:18.741
He didn't make it.

16:20.644 --> 16:22.978
Bullshit.

16:23.046 --> 16:26.014
No, no, no, no.

16:26.082 --> 16:27.483
Wilfred can't die, Ryan.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.552
That's not how this works!

16:29.619 --> 16:31.620
But you... you wanted
to hurt him, right?

16:31.688 --> 16:33.121
You said he was a bad dog.

16:33.189 --> 16:34.690
Yeah.

16:34.758 --> 16:36.425
Hurt him.
I didn't want him killed!

16:36.493 --> 16:37.893
Oh, my God.

16:37.961 --> 16:39.261
Don't you get it?

16:39.329 --> 16:40.696
Without Wilfred,

16:40.764 --> 16:42.465
I got no purpose!

16:42.532 --> 16:43.966
Oh, my God!

16:44.033 --> 16:45.501
I'm nothin'!

16:45.569 --> 16:47.937
Well, at least
you have Deb and Tammy.

16:48.004 --> 16:49.104
Deb and Tammy-- shit!

16:49.172 --> 16:50.138
I can't believe it!

16:50.206 --> 16:51.239
Goddamn it!

16:51.307 --> 16:53.041
This is over.

16:53.109 --> 16:55.344
It's over.

16:57.447 --> 16:59.548
Holy shit! Bruce!

16:59.616 --> 17:01.249
Oh, Jesus.

17:01.317 --> 17:02.818
No! No! No!

17:02.886 --> 17:03.886
No!

17:05.454 --> 17:07.089
Hi, Ryan.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.958
Boom!

17:09.025 --> 17:10.792
Mind-gamed, bitch!

17:10.861 --> 17:11.727
Gotcha!

17:11.795 --> 17:13.561
You're insane!

17:13.630 --> 17:15.196
Uh, insane in the membrane.

17:15.263 --> 17:16.699
Yeah. You know what?

17:16.766 --> 17:18.834
I can't believe
you made fun of me

17:18.902 --> 17:20.903
for taking that special effects
class at the Learning Annex.

17:20.971 --> 17:22.304
You guys

17:22.372 --> 17:23.672
are psychopaths.

17:23.740 --> 17:25.173
No! No, it was just

17:25.241 --> 17:26.976
a prank, Ryan.
When Wilfred told me

17:27.042 --> 17:28.443
that you were gonna try

17:28.512 --> 17:30.078
and put one over on me,
I couldn't resist.

17:30.146 --> 17:32.114
I even got him
to buy the meatballs

17:32.181 --> 17:34.116
after all.

17:34.183 --> 17:39.688
I do love me
some Vincenzo's meatballs.

17:39.756 --> 17:41.423
I thought you were my friend, Wilfred.
I am your friend.

17:41.491 --> 17:43.726
That's why I had to teach you
a valuable lesson.

17:43.793 --> 17:45.753
Never try and mind-game
the masters of mind games.

17:45.762 --> 17:47.830
You cannot win.

17:53.403 --> 17:54.837
What's the matter, Wilfred?

17:54.905 --> 17:56.271
Does it taste a little nutty?

17:56.339 --> 17:59.041
N-No.

17:59.108 --> 18:01.944
But there's no way you...?

18:02.012 --> 18:04.479
Stole a pair of dog testicles
from the biological waste bin

18:04.548 --> 18:07.068
at the vet earlier today 'cause
I figured you'd double-cross me?

18:07.116 --> 18:10.719
No, I couldn't possibly do that.

18:10.787 --> 18:13.022
How could I mind-game
the masters of mind-games?

18:13.089 --> 18:14.723
Let me get this straight.

18:14.791 --> 18:16.324
I'm not gonna be dining

18:16.392 --> 18:18.193
on Vincenzo's
gourmet meatballs today?

18:19.796 --> 18:21.063
Goddamn it!

18:21.130 --> 18:22.097
I went through all this shit

18:22.165 --> 18:24.399
for zero meatballs?!

18:24.467 --> 18:27.036
Get the hell out
of my house, Ryan!

18:27.103 --> 18:28.503
Get out of my house, Wilfred!

18:28.572 --> 18:31.674
Get out! Take that damn
dog testicle with you.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.945
Ryan, I've got to say,

18:36.012 --> 18:37.379
I was impressed back there.

18:37.447 --> 18:39.147
Good game.

18:39.215 --> 18:41.376
You're not mad at me for
making you eat a dog testicle?

18:41.417 --> 18:44.252
Well, actually, it was tastier
than one might think.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.321
I swiped the other one
on my way out.

18:46.389 --> 18:48.156
I'm saving it for
later tonight.

18:52.128 --> 18:53.963
Oh, shit!

18:54.030 --> 18:56.031
Did I leave that on
for three days?

18:59.335 --> 19:02.504
I'll admit, it was nice to get
away from this for a while.

19:02.572 --> 19:04.673
Games are always a
good distraction.

19:07.110 --> 19:09.377
Uh, it's Kristen's
drawing, but...

19:09.445 --> 19:12.380
I saw myself making it.

19:12.448 --> 19:15.383
I saw myself...

19:15.451 --> 19:17.920
drawing the blue barn.

19:17.988 --> 19:20.089
Well, may-maybe
that's all I drew,

19:20.156 --> 19:22.357
but why would I...?

19:49.334 --> 19:51.903
Oh, I can't find
anything on the symbol.

19:53.102 --> 19:55.503
Have you learnt nothing, Ryan?

19:55.570 --> 19:59.107
I mean, how did you even find it
in the first place?

19:59.174 --> 20:01.408
You need some distance.

20:13.889 --> 20:16.758
Serious question:

20:16.825 --> 20:19.360
If you knew that you
could get away with it,

20:19.427 --> 20:22.396
would you rape... someone?

20:22.464 --> 20:25.900
No. Of course not.

20:25.968 --> 20:28.202
You know, I'm like-like
talking about,

20:28.270 --> 20:30.738
like, say, if you knew there
was, like, zero chance

20:30.806 --> 20:33.507
that you could get caught,
like, would you...

20:33.575 --> 20:36.778
rape... someone?

20:36.845 --> 20:40.782
Under no circumstance
would I ever do that.

20:42.384 --> 20:44.585
Nah, me, neither.
