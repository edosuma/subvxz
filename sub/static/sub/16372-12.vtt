00:22.720 --> 00:24.313
Buna?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.280
You're new.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.198
Roll over.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.479
Okay.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.475
What's your name?

02:04.240 --> 02:06.391
- Zack.
- Zack.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.399
Hi.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.074
I see you're ready.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.920
What happened to the new girl?

02:26.600 --> 02:27.716
What new girl?

02:50.960 --> 02:52.679
<i>How much?</i>

02:57.920 --> 03:01.516
Smoll was cleaning over 200 million.
How much was lost?

03:03.240 --> 03:04.276
All of it.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.993
Thank you, Abe.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.349
- Problems?
- Yes.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.677
Transactions vital to my interest
failed to be tendered.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.439
What kinds of transactions?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.911
It seems a bid I made
on the Whistler Cruise Line...

03:24.080 --> 03:26.800
...wasn't tendered
because my accountant dropped dead...

03:26.960 --> 03:28.792
...before he could transfer the funds.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.031
In addition, millions are missing...

03:31.200 --> 03:34.159
...that the same accountant was
in the process of laundering.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.996
- I think I've heard enough.
- It appears my operation is under siege.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.391
And this affects the fate
of the free world how?

03:40.560 --> 03:41.596
Not at all.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.912
However, in order for me to be useful
to your task force...

03:45.120 --> 03:48.272
...I have to maintain a certain...

03:48.440 --> 03:50.636
...stature in the criminal underworld.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.792
From time to time,
I am compelled to rely...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.879
...on your Bureau's support
in that endeavor.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.554
This is one of those times.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.440
The interest I hope to acquire...

04:00.600 --> 04:04.116
...from Whistler Cruise Line was sold
to a long-standing rival...

04:04.280 --> 04:05.555
...Baldur Magnusson.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.070
Rumors have circulated
that he assassinated...

04:08.240 --> 04:11.551
- ...my accountant to secure the deal.
- What do you need from us?

04:11.720 --> 04:12.836
Some help...

04:13.000 --> 04:16.676
...to determine
who murdered my man, Zack Smoll.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.551
If I can't staunch the bleeding
Smoll's death has precipitated...

04:22.120 --> 04:26.956
...all of our work could come
to a grinding and permanent halt.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.631
I'm under attack, Elizabeth.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.793
And I need to find out by whom.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.590
Roughly 14 hours ago,
Zack Smoll was found dead...

04:36.760 --> 04:38.672
...in the Gentle Bliss Massage Parlor.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.999
ME's preliminary report describes
symptoms consistent with meningitis.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.470
How's Reddington know
Smoll didn't get meningitis naturally?

04:45.680 --> 04:49.117
He didn't say, but if he's coming to us
with this, it means he's desperate.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.956
You feel you're paid enough to serve
the public's interests and Reddington's.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.191
- I don't.
- If someone killed his accountant...

04:55.360 --> 04:58.000
...you think he's gonna want us
to just put him in jail?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.755
The second we find him,
he'll insist we hand him over...

05:00.920 --> 05:02.991
...so he can make an example
by murdering him.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.074
I agree. Agent Keen,
tell Reddington he's on his own.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.637
Guys, Smoll's body has
just been flagged by the CDC.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.191
- They rerouted it to a containment lab.
- What does that mean?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.592
It means whatever killed Smoll is
more dangerous than meningitis.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.229
Get to the CDC.
See what you can find out.

05:24.520 --> 05:28.036
- Any idea what we're dealing with?
- Luschen's disease, a form of meningitis.

05:28.200 --> 05:33.036
Symptoms include sudden high fever,
stiffened neck, reddish-purple rash...

05:33.200 --> 05:35.556
...seizure, respiratory failure, and death.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.756
How contagious is it?

05:36.920 --> 05:39.833
This strain's mutated.
It's transmitted via physical contact.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.674
Sweat, saliva,
even the lightest touch can be lethal.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.309
Good news is,
it doesn't survive outside a host.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.915
Symptoms present almost immediately
after exposure...

05:48.080 --> 05:50.720
...followed by death in only minutes,
which is, ironically...

05:50.880 --> 05:53.440
- ...the one saving grace of the disease.
- How so?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.638
It can't travel. Victim's incapacitated
before he can transmit it.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.315
- So how did Smoll get infected?
- Lipstick.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.711
We found traces of it
around the victim's mouth.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.991
Based on the sample,
whoever left it behind...

06:04.160 --> 06:06.800
...should've been dead
before she could kiss our victim.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.032
So who is she?
And why isn't she dead?

06:10.200 --> 06:13.318
Well, for the moment, Agent Ressler,
that remains a mystery.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.918
- I found our suspect.
- Good for you.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.437
Okay, what's going on?

06:22.600 --> 06:25.638
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- Really? Because you seem upset.

06:25.800 --> 06:30.511
And before with Mr. Cooper,
about not getting paid enough...

06:30.680 --> 06:32.717
I lost it in front of
the ladies in Payroll.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.834
They gave me your check
instead of mine because...

06:36.040 --> 06:37.838
...you know, we both have brown faces.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.758
- I'm sure that was a mistake.
- You make 32 percent more than I do.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.279
- Oh, you opened my check.
- I have a Ph.D.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.875
- It's because...
- I have the same responsibilities...

06:48.040 --> 06:49.713
...and people actually shoot at me.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.554
That is true. Okay.
You should say something to Mr. Cooper.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.240
Say what?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.114
Aram has a suspect.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.397
Yes, the suspect.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.034
The suspect, yes.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.797
So I found a partial angle from a security
camera behind the massage parlor.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.996
Check it out.

07:06.160 --> 07:11.030
The CDC has only one other recorded
outbreak of Luschen's in the U.S...

07:11.240 --> 07:13.038
...a pawnbroker in Maryland.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.312
The coroner wrote it off
as natural causes, but the thing is...

07:16.480 --> 07:18.836
...his pawn shop was robbed
the day he died.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.592
So I dug up some security feeds
and look who was there.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.110
Same woman at both outbreaks. One
a robbery, the other an assassination.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.431
And in a bad disguise at both.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.273
What if it's not a disguise?

07:32.440 --> 07:34.159
Look at the time code. It's July.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.391
In Maryland, it must've been 90 degrees.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.956
So either she's sick,
she has fevers, chills...

07:39.120 --> 07:42.909
...or she doesn't want anyone to get sick.
She's using it to mitigate contagion.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.915
- So she's not trying to start a pandemic.
- Well, if we don't find her soon...

07:47.080 --> 07:49.879
...someone else is gonna die
in the process.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.960
- I wish there was another way.
- It's okay.

07:55.160 --> 07:59.518
- But we need it for the next stage.
- It's okay, you don't have to explain.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.717
This is what we both want.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.592
Just do it.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.556
What do you want?

08:26.720 --> 08:28.871
Are the rumors true
that you're responsible...

08:29.040 --> 08:31.714
...for the death of my accountant,
Zack Smoll?

08:31.880 --> 08:34.236
<i>The truth doesn't matter.</i>

08:34.400 --> 08:36.596
It's about appearances.

08:36.760 --> 08:40.833
And at the moment it appears
to virtually everyone who gives a damn...

08:41.039 --> 08:42.712
<i>...that I killed Smoll.</i>

08:42.880 --> 08:46.590
<i>And your failure to retaliate is proof
of your weakness.</i>

08:46.760 --> 08:48.638
<i>Whether I killed him or not is immaterial.</i>

08:48.840 --> 08:51.480
You have no choice but to come for me.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.109
<i>- And you for me.
- Which begs the question:</i>

08:54.280 --> 08:56.158
Why bother with a phone call?

08:56.560 --> 08:59.029
Because we've known each other
for a long time.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.271
We understand
each other's organizations.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.674
<i>If Cristobal acted without your authority
or someone forced your hand...</i>

09:06.840 --> 09:09.400
...tell me. We can try and sort it out.

09:09.760 --> 09:13.436
After all, you're a bit long in the tooth
for a street brawl.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.512
You think so?

09:22.280 --> 09:25.273
- I've reviewed the case file you sent.
- And you've got something?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.956
You know, many ancient cultures
shared a common figure...

09:29.120 --> 09:30.998
...a god or demon...

09:31.160 --> 09:33.755
...who brought disease to humanity.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.037
The Finns called her Loviatar.

09:36.200 --> 09:40.240
The Yoruba people knew her
as Shapona.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.837
The Greeks, of course,
immortalized Pandora.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.673
<i>Odd that they're always women.</i>

09:45.840 --> 09:47.832
Have you ever heard of Mary Mallon?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.036
<i>Should I have?</i>

09:49.200 --> 09:53.353
She was a cook for the New York elite
in the late 19th century.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.115
When an alarming number
of high-society swells...

09:56.320 --> 09:58.277
...came down with typhoid fever...

09:58.440 --> 10:01.194
...a research scientist traced
the outbreak...

10:01.360 --> 10:04.512
...to a woman with the rare ability
to carry the disease...

10:04.680 --> 10:09.197
...without suffering its effects
or exhibiting any outward symptoms...

10:09.360 --> 10:11.556
<i>- ...earning her the name...
- Typhoid Mary.</i>

10:11.720 --> 10:13.040
Correct.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.831
You're looking for an asymptomatic
carrier of Luschen's disease.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.753
<i>To find your suspect...</i>

10:19.920 --> 10:23.596
...you need to know when and where
was the outbreak that she survived.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.796
And hurry.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.112
There's a reason the plague bringers
were the most feared...

10:28.280 --> 10:31.000
...among the ancient deities.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.718
You've got that little crease
between your brow.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.599
Right here.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.515
That always happens when you're upset.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.834
The spinal tap didn't yield the results
that I was expecting.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.760
And we still need
specialized equipment...

10:54.960 --> 10:57.919
- ...which means that...
- More money.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.556
More people.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.359
I found another opportunity...

11:04.760 --> 11:08.959
...that we can handle,
that you can handle, I'm sure of it.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.359
Please.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.880
Look at me.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.955
I'm gonna figure this out. I swear it.
I just need a little bit more time.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.317
We're so close.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.752
All right, baby, home sweet home.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.274
All right, come on, you.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.197
Please excuse the intrusion.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.560
She's not here.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.951
I'm not here to see Elizabeth.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.199
What do you know about Edgar Legate?

12:09.360 --> 12:12.558
When it comes to assassins, he's
the standard. Nobody's ever seen him.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.200
Precisely.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.670
Because he doesn't exist.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.951
Legate is an elaborate fiction.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.431
- A bogeyman I created.
- No, no, Legate is real.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.832
- I know of at least six jobs the guy's done.
- Or so you believe.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.878
Edgar Legate is nothing more...

12:28.040 --> 12:32.876
...than a name I employ to take credit
for various killings for which I...

12:33.040 --> 12:35.316
...or my associates are responsible.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.230
One of my competitors,
Baldur Magnusson, is actively seeking...

12:39.440 --> 12:43.116
...a reliable independent contractor
to kill me.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.360
Someone I won't see coming.
I think Legate would fit the bill nicely.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.796
- You want me to become Legate.
- I thought maybe.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.670
Forget it. I'm not gonna play assassin
so you can kill someone I've never met.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.799
I don't need you to become Legate
to kill Magnusson.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.597
I need you to become Legate
so Magnusson will hire you to kill me.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.032
- You want me to deliver him to you.
- Yes.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.197
If you can find a sitter.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.634
- I wanna talk to you after this.
- Yeah, sure.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.317
So I looked into Mr. Reddington's
Typhoid Mary angle. I found something.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.598
The first recorded outbreak
of Luschen's in human beings...

13:27.760 --> 13:30.992
...occurred in rural Moldova in 2002.

13:31.200 --> 13:36.036
A family of nine wiped out,
except for one daughter, Natalie Luca.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.079
She was taken to a local clinic,
but the outbreak was deemed...

13:39.240 --> 13:41.550
- ...too much to handle.
- How did she get out of Moldova?

13:41.720 --> 13:45.794
The World Health Organization
called in Hawthorne Biologics...

13:45.960 --> 13:49.351
...a company that specializes
in infectious-disease response.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.753
They brought the girl back to their clinic
outside Alexandria for further treatment.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.436
I had no idea Natalie was capable
of anything like this.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.159
We care for dozens of patients...

13:59.320 --> 14:02.154
...who are too infectious
to live outside a strict quarantine.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.272
Out of all of them...

14:04.440 --> 14:06.750
...Natalie was the sweetest, the kindest.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.992
If she was so infectious,
how come she's at large?

14:10.200 --> 14:12.715
We did our best to give her a normal life.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.270
But she was young,
determined to be independent.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.558
We did everything we could
to dissuade her from leaving.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.792
But eventually, we had no choice
but to comply with her wishes.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.437
How is that possible? She was infected
with a deadly contagion.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.990
We had no legal right to hold her.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.516
She was young.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.632
- She was in love.
- In love? With who?

14:34.800 --> 14:38.271
Malik Roumain. He was
a promising, young bioresearch tech.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.110
<i>- They're here.
- But they couldn't touch each other?</i>

14:42.280 --> 14:45.318
<i>No. It's hard to imagine
in the absence of physical contact...</i>

14:45.480 --> 14:47.039
<i>...but certainly not impossible.</i>

14:47.240 --> 14:51.757
<i>He advocated for her, agreed to take
responsibility for her quarantine...</i>

14:51.920 --> 14:55.516
...and see to her needs. We agreed
to a year-long break from testing...

14:55.680 --> 15:00.072
...in exchange
for Malik submitting regular reports.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.472
Until you called,
we had no idea they were gone.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.554
Reports kept coming in, so we assumed
they were still at the house we provided.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.753
- It turns out they moved months ago.
- You didn't check on them?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.120
I wanted to respect their privacy.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.831
If you need anything further from me...

15:19.400 --> 15:21.960
...please don't hesitate to call.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.755
If anything were to happen to this child...

15:25.920 --> 15:28.480
...I don't know that I'll be able
to forgive myself.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.790
If I were you...

15:30.880 --> 15:34.237
...I'd be more worried about
what might happen to everyone else.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.520
Hi. I'm so sorry.
We're doing this scavenger hunt...

15:42.680 --> 15:45.878
...for my sorority, and I need
to kiss two guys with a gun.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.918
- Seriously?
- I know, it's stupid.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.799
Do your worst.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.874
So does your friend have a gun too?

16:29.560 --> 16:33.600
If you had allowed me secure the facility,
Malik never could have broken her out.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.951
We agreed
your men would've drawn attention.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.874
Enough. What did you tell the FBI?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.839
That Natalie voluntarily chose
to leave with Malik.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.754
They have no reason to suspect
the nature of our research.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.470
- Only a matter of time till they find them.
- Then be there when they do.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.633
Perhaps it would be best
to temporarily suspend our research.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.029
Out of the question.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.199
Our top priority at this point
is recovering Natalie. Alive.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.477
- Understand?
- Yeah.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.355
Malik Roumain,
born to immigrant parents...

17:03.520 --> 17:06.752
...full boat to Berkeley at 17.
The American dream.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.112
By 23 he had his Ph.D. in biochemistry
from Johns Hopkins...

17:10.280 --> 17:14.194
...and turned down a number of highly
paid offers for a postdoc at Hawthorne.

17:14.359 --> 17:17.397
Hawthorne claims that he and Natalie fell
for each other while he worked there.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.711
- Forbidden love.
- There's another attack.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.917
An armored truck was taken down
in Bethesda. CDC's on site.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.675
They should have something for us soon.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.240
Aram.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.200
Cooper called me in.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.837
Apparently the ladies in Accounting
were not thrilled with my freak-out.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.880
- Did you tell him why you freaked out?
- Yeah. He offered me a raise, 16 percent.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.714
- That's fantastic.
- I'd still make less than you.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.633
Okay, but, you know, it's a start.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.157
No, it isn't. It's an insult.
I turned it down.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.313
He's here.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.399
All clear.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.399
Excuse me. Wrong door, sir.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.913
You're the ugliest chambermaid
I ever seen.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.237
Myron. My sincere condolences.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.512
- Who died?
- You did.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.794
I need Baldur Magnusson
to believe Edgar Legate is in town.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.952
What better way
to announce that than by...

18:50.120 --> 18:54.034
...making him believe Legate killed
a larcenist of your stature.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.672
<i>And what better place for the deadly deed
to occur than the flagship hotel...</i>

18:58.840 --> 19:00.672
<i>...Magnusson owns and operates.</i>

19:00.840 --> 19:05.551
<i>By the time our little charade is finished,
Magnusson will be scouring the town...</i>

19:05.720 --> 19:08.076
<i>...desperate to hire your killer.</i>

19:08.240 --> 19:10.800
Not to worry. We'll have you
out of there in a jiffy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.593
We'll be ordering room service...

19:12.760 --> 19:15.958
...and watching the game
with my associates before you know it.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.318
You'll provide the body,
we'll provide the evidence.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.956
CDC confirmed the victims of the
armored truck robbery died of Luschen's.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.670
Witnesses saw a 2006,
dark red Ford van, partial plate...

19:28.840 --> 19:30.877
...7-Mike-Echo-6.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.794
Okay, the vehicle is registered
under a Alec Moore.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.953
That's him. He must have registered
the car under an alias.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.919
- Pulling up his address.
- Samar, Ressler, get over there.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.199
Liz, pull together a Hazmat team.
Have them meet them at the location.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.953
- Can I help you, sir?
- As a matter of fact, you can.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.875
I believe this man checked out
of your hotel earlier today.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.829
He's an old friend. I lost my head
and forgot our appointment.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.595
I was wondering if you could tell me
where he was headed.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.235
The airport perhaps? Train station?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.551
Or was he driving himself?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.359
I'm afraid I don't know.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.871
And even if I did, I would not be
at liberty to say. I'm sorry.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.596
Keep it.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.120
Discretion is a rare
and tragically undervalued quality.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.232
<i>- Yes.
- Reddington was here...</i>

20:30.400 --> 20:32.392
<i>...looking for a guest, Michel Badot.</i>

20:32.560 --> 20:34.995
<i>He was there when they removed
the body, watching.</i>

20:35.160 --> 20:37.391
- It's Legate.
- What do you want me to do?

20:37.560 --> 20:38.755
<i>Secure Legate.</i>

20:38.960 --> 20:40.758
I want a word.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.833
Police! Open up!

20:49.200 --> 20:51.556
- Move!
- Straight ahead!

20:52.960 --> 20:53.996
Agent Ressler.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.632
What the hell is this place?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.389
- You got it.
- Yeah.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.634
It cost everything that we got, but if I can
isolate the enzymes, we'll be able to...

21:09.000 --> 21:10.673
What is it?

21:11.960 --> 21:13.360
What's wrong?

21:14.400 --> 21:15.436
They found the house.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.400
- Who?
- The cops.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.597
They have all of our equipment
and research.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.513
- What should we do?
- What can we do?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.592
Natalie, we have to start all over again.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.712
Malik, I'm sure there's something we...

21:25.880 --> 21:28.270
- Natalie, just...
- Don't!

21:28.440 --> 21:30.033
I'm sorry.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.190
I love you, Natalie. There's nothing
that I wouldn't do for you.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.550
You know that.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.600
We'll... We'll start again.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.319
How?

21:45.320 --> 21:47.232
Another job.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.553
One that I heard about from Hawthorne. I
wouldn't ask if it wasn't necessary. It is.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.272
But it's the only way.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.077
But after this...

22:03.920 --> 22:07.311
- ...I won't have to hurt anyone else?
- No, never again.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.559
I promise.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.192
Take your hand in mine.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.075
And I'll pull you closer.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.591
And I'll feel your breath
against my skin.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.753
- And I'll kiss you.
- The two of us.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.712
- Forever.
- Forever.

22:52.720 --> 22:56.555
Monsieur Legate.
My employer would like a word with you.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.669
He was trying to isolate the enzyme in
her blood that shields her from Luschen's.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.672
He was trying to replicate her immunity.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.115
- Cure?
- No, the opposite.

23:09.320 --> 23:12.472
The boyfriend was trying to infect himself
so he could be immune like her.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.838
He was willing to give himself
an incurable disease so they could...

23:16.040 --> 23:17.793
...touch and kiss and be together.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.593
Typhoid Mary, meet Typhoid Larry.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.479
The pawn shop in Maryland...

23:21.640 --> 23:24.394
...the armored car driver,
they're robbing people...

23:24.560 --> 23:27.394
- ...to pay for their research.
- I get that, but...

23:27.560 --> 23:31.315
...what I don't get is what any of this has
to do with Reddington's man, Smoll.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.800
What are we looking at?

23:32.960 --> 23:36.112
I pulled these from one of Malik's
hard drives. They're blueprints...

23:36.280 --> 23:40.672
...for a compound in Sag Harbor,
New York, owned by an offshore trust.

23:40.840 --> 23:45.551
Now, he also had a number of dossiers,
including these.

23:45.720 --> 23:49.839
Francois Troyet, owner of the world's
largest private collection...

23:50.000 --> 23:51.832
...of post-Impressionist art.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.357
William Lawsover, a billionaire
corporate debt restructurer.

23:55.520 --> 24:00.675
Caitlin Montag, a gajillionaire author
of the Buddy Chanticleer novels.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.480
The writing is atrocious,
but I can't put them down.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.316
Other than being rich,
what do these three have in common?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.791
Xavier Holcombe's annual poker bash...

24:10.960 --> 24:15.637
...an all-cash, no-limit marathon
with positively obscene stakes.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.917
<i>- How obscene?
- Buy-in is half a million.</i>

24:18.080 --> 24:20.720
Quite the research grant
for our star-crossed outlaws.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.190
I bought in on a lark three years ago.
Lost my...

24:23.360 --> 24:26.990
Well, no one has a shirt that expensive.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.833
Nevertheless, I had a ball.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.950
<i>It's a weekend of delicious isolation
and degenerate risk. Heaven.</i>

24:34.160 --> 24:37.631
<i>Just like everything else is to you,
a game.</i>

24:37.800 --> 24:39.120
Where's Tom?

24:39.280 --> 24:40.430
Belgium.

24:40.600 --> 24:44.389
<i>You know, Tom and I were just starting
to find some semblance of normalcy.</i>

24:44.560 --> 24:49.077
And you had to just sweep in,
drag him back down your rabbit hole.

24:49.240 --> 24:52.472
<i>There must be dozens of contract
operatives just like him. Why him?</i>

24:52.640 --> 24:54.916
Tom is very good at what he does.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.912
It defines him.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.719
He can no sooner choose to stop...

24:58.880 --> 25:01.839
...than a great white shark
can stop swimming and eating.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.630
<i>He will do what he does,
but at least if he's doing it for me...</i>

25:05.800 --> 25:07.439
...he won't risk a double-cross...

25:07.600 --> 25:11.310
...unlike with the vast majority
of his perspective employers.

25:11.480 --> 25:15.474
<i>Because unlike them,
I genuinely care for him, or rather you...</i>

25:15.640 --> 25:17.472
<i>...and your daughter.</i>

25:17.640 --> 25:21.634
Holcombe's game commences precisely
at 6. You don't have much time.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.355
Care for a claw?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.480
No, thanks.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.438
- As I told your goons...
- Tut-tut.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.195
Don't be uncharitable.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.319
These gentlemen are
seasoned professionals like yourself.

25:41.480 --> 25:45.633
Monsieur Edgar Legate.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.919
I don't insist on the "Monsieur."

25:51.960 --> 25:55.590
That Saudi oil minister
in Kuala Lumpur...

25:56.080 --> 25:58.834
...how on earth
did you manage that one?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.992
I don't discuss the details of my work.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.395
I appreciate that...

26:02.560 --> 26:06.713
...particularly as I wish
to engage your services.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.678
You know, I usually require
a referral for a new client...

26:11.880 --> 26:15.191
...but I might be able
to make an exception.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.909
So Legate works for you.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.390
In a manner of speaking.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.470
Well, I suppose it was inevitable,
one way or the other.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.951
Looks like it's "the other."

26:42.160 --> 26:45.597
Kill me and restore your reputation.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.433
Give us a moment.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.392
You said something before:

27:01.320 --> 27:03.676
The truth doesn't matter.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.359
That the only thing
in this world that matters...

27:07.560 --> 27:10.632
...is just the appearance of truth.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.600
I fear you might be right about that.

27:14.440 --> 27:18.753
Lately, I find the truth has become...

27:19.880 --> 27:21.951
...so elusive.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.638
Often imaginary.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.398
But in the end,
it's all that we're left with, isn't it?

27:30.560 --> 27:35.510
What is real, what you can taste,
and touch and feel.

27:35.680 --> 27:40.357
The words that pass between us
as we look each other in the eye...

27:40.520 --> 27:45.800
...are all we have to hold onto.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.753
The truth...

27:51.480 --> 27:53.756
...I hold it dear.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.078
I didn't kill your accountant.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.876
Your deal was falling apart.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.392
I stepped in and took it.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.394
And I would have done exactly the same.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.192
Keep the ships, Baldur.

28:13.360 --> 28:17.149
As Rat said to Mole,
"There is nothing, absolutely nothing...

28:17.320 --> 28:20.392
...half so much worth doing
as simply messing about in boats."

28:21.120 --> 28:22.600
It's funny.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.039
For the longest time I've...

28:26.200 --> 28:29.557
...been perfectly comfortable
knowing I could die at any moment.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.757
I could walk out of this room,
be shot in the street.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.957
I've always been fine with that.

28:34.120 --> 28:38.000
But lately I can smell it in the air
around me...

28:41.560 --> 28:43.677
...like death is...

28:44.080 --> 28:47.756
...slouching towards me
from the corners of the room.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.198
And I cannot tell if it is here for me...

28:57.520 --> 29:00.433
...or just an echo of the past.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.317
I wish it had been you.

29:04.960 --> 29:07.236
It would've been so much easier.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.315
Thank you so much.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.870
- One here. Red too.
- I'm in.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.435
- Raise.
- Three red.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.560
Oyster delivery for Mr. Holcombe.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.029
About time, you're an hour late.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.794
<i>- We're two minutes out.
- How soon until Hazmat is on site?</i>

29:55.960 --> 29:57.440
Ten minutes.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.198
FBI. We have reason to believe...

30:15.360 --> 30:17.397
...your compound is
under biological attack.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.075
We need you
to start evacuating immediately.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.434
<i>Samar, what do you got?</i>

30:28.600 --> 30:31.638
There's no sign of Malik. I'm going in.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.598
Get on the ground! Move!

30:50.760 --> 30:52.433
Move, move. Did she touch you?

30:52.600 --> 30:54.512
Stop, Natalie, stop!

30:58.120 --> 31:00.555
Don't move.
No one else has to die today.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.110
- Malik!
- You need to come with us now.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.272
If you wanna stop me,
you have to kill me.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.436
- Please don't make me do that.
- I can't be locked up again.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.351
Suspect's in custody.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.919
There's no sign of Malik.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.915
Aram, check that local P.D. shut down
the roads 10 miles in every direction.

31:27.080 --> 31:30.596
On it. That Hazmat team we sent earlier,
they should be there any minute.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.480
Hazmat's transported her.
What are you talking about?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.599
<i>- The Hazmat team.
- The Hazmat team is already en route.</i>

31:38.800 --> 31:40.473
Oh, my God.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.552
We've gone to quite a lot of trouble...

31:50.760 --> 31:53.958
...to find you, young lady.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.715
You're the most valuable asset
in our portfolio.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.556
The FBI was kind enough to lend
an assist and lead us straight to you.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.791
I won't go back there.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.596
<i>- Aram?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.</i>

32:06.760 --> 32:09.673
Come on now. All right.
Satellite's coming around now.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.595
Okay, they're heading southeast
on Holly Knoll Drive.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.631
They're about 200 yards
past Mile-marker 46.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.592
Okay, weird. There's another vehicle
trying to push them off the road.

32:41.480 --> 32:44.154
<i>Okay, now both vehicles are off
the roadway.</i>

32:44.320 --> 32:47.518
They're about a quarter mile
before Marker 45.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.399
I thought I lost you.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.438
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

33:02.600 --> 33:06.879
- What do we do now?
- We'll go in the woods. We'll find a car...

33:09.560 --> 33:11.074
Don't move!

33:16.080 --> 33:18.311
- Natalie.
- Oh, my God.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.630
Don't.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.792
We need help!

33:21.960 --> 33:23.394
- I'm sorry.
- No.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.671
- I'm so sorry. I was wrong.
- No.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.435
- I was so wrong.
- No.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.319
I never should've made you.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.474
I would have done anything
to be with you.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.278
Take your hand in mine.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.114
So soft.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.956
And I pull you close.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.871
I feel your breath against my skin.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.512
And I kiss you.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.833
The two of us.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.233
Forever.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.112
Give her a minute.

34:55.600 --> 35:00.038
I can describe every tile
in the room they kept me in.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.514
For 13 years,
I was just a medical curiosity.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.390
But then there was Malik.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.159
He was the only one
who really saw me.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.597
Not the subject...

35:15.600 --> 35:18.798
...but me, Natalie.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.155
- What made you leave?
- At first...

35:23.120 --> 35:25.157
...we thought the research
they were doing...

35:25.320 --> 35:27.312
...was our best chance
at being together.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.595
But when Malik learned
what Whitehall was doing...

35:30.760 --> 35:33.798
- Whitehall?
- Hawthorne's weapons lab.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.634
They weren't trying to cure me.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.917
They were using me...

35:39.080 --> 35:41.231
...my cells...

35:41.720 --> 35:45.509
- ...to develop a biological weapon.
- So why didn't you go to the authorities?

35:45.680 --> 35:48.479
Hawthorne has contracts
with the government.

35:49.160 --> 35:52.676
We didn't know who we could trust.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.672
I'm sorry.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.880
We're...

35:57.560 --> 36:02.430
We're really sorry for all those people.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.713
I know.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.874
It was one of the most romantic things
I've ever seen.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.600
He died in her arms.

36:43.800 --> 36:48.556
It was like an episode of,
I don't know, some show.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.795
Point is, it made me feel
a little sorry for myself...

36:51.960 --> 36:54.191
...that I didn't have someone like that.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.919
What, to die in your arms?

36:57.160 --> 37:00.312
And then I started thinking
about my raise...

37:00.480 --> 37:02.392
...16 percent.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.199
That's an odd number.

37:04.360 --> 37:08.798
And then I thought, it's exactly half of the
difference between what you and I make.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.316
I went down to the ladies
in Accounting.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.437
They never talked to Cooper.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.036
You did.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.959
You gave me half of your 32 percent.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.476
- Now we get paid equally.
- I don't want your money.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.235
Why not? You were right.
We do the same thing.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.551
- No, we don't.
- I know.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.070
- You put your life on the line and...
- What you do...

37:30.240 --> 37:34.280
I'm sure you deserve more. I have this
student loan, this online poker debt...

37:34.480 --> 37:37.837
What you did,
no one else would do for me.

37:38.480 --> 37:41.518
- I'd do anything for you.
- I know.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.957
Which is why I have no reason
to feel sorry for myself.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.070
How'd it go?

38:04.440 --> 38:06.079
Honestly, it was great.

38:06.240 --> 38:11.918
I was thinking about what you said,
about why I needed that.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.115
Truth is, I still don't know.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.158
But what I do know...

38:18.200 --> 38:21.591
...is that this family is
the most important thing in my life.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.554
I don't wanna lose it.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.279
We just arrested a woman who...

38:29.320 --> 38:33.200
...would have done anything
to stay with the person she loved...

38:34.480 --> 38:36.472
...but she lost him anyway.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.757
I'm not going anywhere.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.391
That's not what I meant.

38:44.480 --> 38:49.316
From the beginning,
we've been fighting secrets...

38:50.560 --> 38:52.597
...and agendas...

38:54.840 --> 38:57.400
...and psychotic, homicidal killers...

38:57.600 --> 39:00.115
...coming between us.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.997
And for the first time, we're together...

39:04.160 --> 39:06.072
...and we've got no one to fight.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.800
- But it still feels...
- Like we're coming apart.

39:11.960 --> 39:15.476
I know this family is
the most important thing to you...

39:16.080 --> 39:20.757
...but it's not gonna work
if you can't be who you are.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.680
- I guess I'm just scared.
- Of what?

39:23.880 --> 39:26.634
I'm not gonna love that person.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.833
Do you love me?

39:31.360 --> 39:34.512
- Yes.
- Then you love that person.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.598
Because that's who I am.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.957
I understand the work we do
depends on you...

39:57.160 --> 39:58.514
...so I'm going to allow this.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.400
But understand this,
we are sworn officers of the law.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.791
Do not expect us again
to carry your water.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.630
You work for us,
not the other way around.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.320
Is that clear?

40:08.880 --> 40:13.113
I'm sorry to have put you
in such a difficult position, Harold.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.237
Who are you?

40:38.800 --> 40:42.760
Losing someone we love is painful.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.637
Agonizing even unto death.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.639
<i>The Japanese call it takotsubo:</i>

40:50.400 --> 40:56.112
A grieving surge
of abnormal electrical waves...

40:56.280 --> 40:59.717
...that causes the heart to deflate...

40:59.880 --> 41:03.794
...and contort until it resembles...

41:03.960 --> 41:05.713
...a fishing pot.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.791
Hollow and cold.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.071
An empty vessel...

41:13.400 --> 41:16.074
...at the bottom of a fathomless sea.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.875
I'm sorry for your loss.

41:23.880 --> 41:27.430
You've suffered enough of that
in your life.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.717
What do you want?

41:32.360 --> 41:35.239
The man you killed...

41:37.200 --> 41:39.351
...at the massage parlor...

41:39.520 --> 41:42.035
...was an associate of mine.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.080
You didn't know him,
you didn't rob him.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.792
Someone hired you
to assassinate him.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.956
She knew who I was.
We had no choice.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.717
She said if I didn't kill him, she would
tell Hawthorne where to find us.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.360
Who?

42:00.880 --> 42:02.758
Isabella Stone.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.520
Thank you.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.836
Natalie, do you mind
if I sit here for a moment?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.959
For the life of me, I don't think
I could get up right now.
