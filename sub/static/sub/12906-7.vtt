made it look extra special.

16:32.916 --> 16:35.716
He did give an amazing blowout.

Besides, he's involved
with that awful cult.

16:40.489 --> 16:42.589
It doesn't seem that bad.

Rosie, what's going on?

16:50.232 --> 16:53.033
Is this
about Peri's murder again?

16:53.068 --> 16:56.069
I think the cult had something
to do with it,

16:56.104 --> 16:59.306

because I'm not rich...

17:06.781 --> 17:08.882
Well,
why didn't you just say so?

17:08.916 --> 17:11.282
- I'll join.

Well, don't look so shocked.
I've belonged to a cult before.

17:15.021 --> 17:17.623
In my defense, it was the '80s,

28:12.058 --> 28:17.058
If Peri had a secret,
maybe it got her killed.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.930
Are you actually defending
your mother?

28:19.965 --> 28:22.465
We caught her off-guard.
She doesn't like surprises.

28:22.501 --> 28:24.101
She's crazy!

28:24.136 --> 28:25.468
One minute,
I'm her best friend.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.036
The next minute,
she's kicking me out.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.138
She's not mad at you.
She's mad at me.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.441
She thinks if I'm dating
someone, I'll be distracted.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.443
From what?

28:33.478 --> 28:35.545
You're upset.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.180
Let me pour you a drink.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.349
You know what?
I think your mother's jealous.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.619
She's afraid I'm gonna take away
her little boy.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.121
She's just overly protective.

28:45.156 --> 28:47.690
So tell her to back off.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.794
We just need to give her
some more time, okay?

28:51.830 --> 28:53.229
She'll come around.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.664
I'm not gonna <i> wait</i>
for her to come around.

28:55.700 --> 28:56.866
Zoila, please.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.635
Kyle, you are a grown man.

28:59.670 --> 29:03.839
If you can't stand up to your
mother, then this is over.

29:03.874 --> 29:07.209
♪ ♪

29:11.349 --> 29:13.716
Oh, Evelyn,
can you give me a hand?

29:13.751 --> 29:15.083
I'm sorry.

29:15.119 --> 29:16.718
I'm very busy learning
how to be a better,

29:16.754 --> 29:18.653
more considerate person.

29:18.688 --> 29:21.022
Well, so far, so good.

29:21.058 --> 29:22.590
Are you reading the Bible?

29:22.626 --> 29:24.726
I'm studying up
for my next date with James.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.730
I'd like to strike the right
balance of sexy but pious.

29:28.766 --> 29:31.399
Oh!
You really like this guy.

29:31.434 --> 29:32.900
I'm just as surprised
as you are.

29:32.935 --> 29:34.535
Here I was thinking I was
too good for him.

29:34.571 --> 29:36.904
It turns out it's just
the opposite.

29:36.939 --> 29:38.740
What happened?

29:38.775 --> 29:41.242
He's just... kind.

29:41.278 --> 29:43.177
He wants
to make the world better.

29:43.212 --> 29:45.846
Sounds like a breath
of fresh air after Adrian.

29:45.882 --> 29:47.948
Exactly. Now,
if you'll excuse me,

29:47.984 --> 29:50.084
I need to revamp
my entire personality.

29:58.294 --> 30:00.060
All right, take this
to the truck

30:00.096 --> 30:02.386
and ask Rafael
to help with the rest.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.566
Are you James Hamilton?

30:05.601 --> 30:07.101
I am.

30:07.136 --> 30:08.435
Are you here to volunteer?

30:08.471 --> 30:10.670
[Chuckles] No, not likely.

30:10.706 --> 30:12.106
I heard about the work you do,

30:12.141 --> 30:13.873
and I wanted
to see it for myself.

30:13.909 --> 30:16.676
Well, I'm always proud to tell
people about Hamilton House.

30:16.712 --> 30:18.178
Well, over the years,

30:18.214 --> 30:19.413
we've helped thousands
of children who don't have...

30:19.448 --> 30:20.780
You don't have to sell me, Rev.

30:20.816 --> 30:23.249
I've already written you
a check.

30:23.284 --> 30:25.317
Well, that was easy.

30:27.089 --> 30:29.022
Wow.
That's, um...

30:29.057 --> 30:30.389
Impressive?

30:30.425 --> 30:31.905
Of course,
there are strings attached.

30:31.927 --> 30:33.426
Strings?

30:33.461 --> 30:36.596
Yes. Perhaps I should
introduce myself.

30:36.632 --> 30:39.031
- I'm Adrian Powell.
- Oh.

30:39.066 --> 30:41.367
I'm giving you this donation
on one condition...

30:41.402 --> 30:43.902
You stay away from my wife.

30:43.938 --> 30:45.560
- Mr. Powell...
- Think of all the

30:45.562 --> 30:46.972
good you could do with it.

30:47.008 --> 30:48.541
You can't possibly
choose Evelyn

30:48.576 --> 30:51.444
over the needs of the poor,
sweet children.

30:51.479 --> 30:53.646
Can you?

30:53.681 --> 30:55.614
Go on, take it.

30:55.650 --> 30:58.050
Really, it's
the Christian thing to do.

31:02.198 --> 31:04.954
I am so sorry to get you
involved like this.

31:04.989 --> 31:06.674
I told you I have your back.

31:06.709 --> 31:09.170
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to
fight your girlfriend's battles.

31:09.205 --> 31:11.707
[Chuckles] I'm not here
because you're my girlfriend.

31:11.742 --> 31:14.531
I'm here because you're a writer
that I believe in.

31:14.596 --> 31:16.296
Okay?

31:16.332 --> 31:18.365
Ah, if you get called
into the big boss' office,

31:18.400 --> 31:19.967
there better be Scotch
and hookers.

31:20.002 --> 31:21.301
[Sighs] I'm just kidding.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.869
[Door closes] I hate Scotch.

31:22.904 --> 31:24.804
[Trey chuckles]

31:24.840 --> 31:27.306
Well, I thought we should all get
on the same page about the script.

31:27.342 --> 31:29.075
Couldn't agree more.
Me too.

31:29.110 --> 31:33.145
First off,
Maria won't be a man.

31:33.181 --> 31:35.348
It... It changes the tone
of the whole piece.

31:35.383 --> 31:37.684
And you think people will buy it
if it's a woman?

31:37.719 --> 31:40.519
I mean, that, uh,
Marisol is nuts.

31:40.554 --> 31:43.155
I'm Marisol.
The character is Maria.

31:43.191 --> 31:44.991
Oh.

31:45.026 --> 31:50.026
I think Maria and Marisol are
both layered and interesting.

31:50.865 --> 31:54.033
Fine, just make sure
you cast someone thin.

31:54.068 --> 31:55.667
Yeah, not one of those
fat-tresses

31:55.703 --> 31:57.002
that are all the rage
right now.

31:57.037 --> 32:00.338

Oh, my God, that...

32:00.374 --> 32:01.406
is fine.

You know, um,

32:02.910 --> 32:04.943
as long as we're being candid
and everything,

32:04.979 --> 32:07.078
I've got to tell you that, um,

32:07.114 --> 32:09.915
I'm not feeling great
about your choice of writer.

32:12.987 --> 32:14.707
We tried this movie
with a different writer,

32:14.721 --> 32:15.953
and it didn't work.

32:15.989 --> 32:18.390
We brought Marisol in
to get it right.

32:18.425 --> 32:21.759
Well, be that as it may,
I've made up my mind.

32:21.794 --> 32:24.529
So it's either her or me.

32:24.564 --> 32:27.865
[Laughing] Oh, well, fine.

32:27.901 --> 32:30.234
We'll get another director.

32:30.269 --> 32:31.769
Maybe even a woman.

32:31.804 --> 32:33.571
Come on.

32:33.606 --> 32:34.906
Hugh's made millions
for the studio.

32:34.941 --> 32:36.641
He has two Oscars.

32:36.676 --> 32:38.976

who's off the project.

Peter?

look, I'm sorry.

Oh... no.

32:56.962 --> 32:59.163
I get it.

Excuse me.

33:06.504 --> 33:08.004
[Door closes]

33:11.043 --> 33:12.642
Genevieve Delatour?

33:12.678 --> 33:14.578
All her deepest and darkest.

33:14.613 --> 33:18.181
I thought she couldn't be
recruited.

33:18.216 --> 33:20.816
Well done.

33:20.851 --> 33:22.118
I need to speak to you, Mother.

33:22.153 --> 33:23.953
Alone.

33:23.988 --> 33:27.755
Ooh, Glasses is in a mood.

33:27.791 --> 33:31.826
Kyle, I don't want to fight.

33:31.861 --> 33:34.596
My whole life,
I have never said no to you,

33:34.631 --> 33:35.930
but Zoila makes me happy.

33:35.966 --> 33:37.199
Why can't I be with her?

33:37.234 --> 33:38.800
Zoila is a discontent.

33:38.835 --> 33:41.470
You've already changed
under her influence.

33:41.505 --> 33:43.605
You're afraid of her.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.841
You think that she'll lure me
away from you and The Circle.

33:46.876 --> 33:50.712
That relationship is over,
and so is this conversation.

33:50.747 --> 33:52.213
Understood?

33:52.248 --> 33:54.548
Go to hell, Mother.

33:58.154 --> 33:59.820

33:59.855 --> 34:01.955
Oh, my God.
Carmen, are you okay?

34:01.991 --> 34:04.191
I'll be fine. Ow.

34:04.227 --> 34:06.127
Oh, what can I get you?

34:06.162 --> 34:08.362
A decaf latte would be nice.

34:08.397 --> 34:09.830
Of course.

34:09.864 --> 34:11.364
That's $5.95.

[Voice breaking]
My life is a total mess.

34:19.507 --> 34:21.041
No. No, it's not.

34:21.076 --> 34:23.342
I don't have a career
or a husband.

34:23.378 --> 34:25.512
And I was supposed
to be a star, you know?

34:25.547 --> 34:27.547
I mean, that's why I gave up
Danni, you know?

34:27.581 --> 34:31.351
- Danni?
- I've wasted my whole life,

34:31.386 --> 34:33.652
and I can't get free coffee
because I'm 40,

34:33.688 --> 34:35.821
and even <i> you</i> don't think
I'm hot anymore!

34:35.857 --> 34:37.690
Ow!

34:37.725 --> 34:39.659
Carmen.
Carmen, look at me.

34:39.694 --> 34:41.327
Look, you see that?

34:41.362 --> 34:42.762
The boss installed it last week

34:42.797 --> 34:44.864
to make sure
we don't give stuff away.

34:46.534 --> 34:47.900
Really?

34:47.935 --> 34:50.936
If it were up to me,
you'd always get free coffee

34:50.972 --> 34:53.773
and free scones and muffins.

34:53.808 --> 34:55.708
So you still think I'm hot?

34:55.743 --> 34:59.444
[Sighs] Carmen, I think you're
the most beautiful woman

34:59.480 --> 35:01.047
in the whole world.

35:03.284 --> 35:06.885
[Both moan, breathing heavily]

35:09.723 --> 35:11.756
I can't believe
that just happened.

35:11.792 --> 35:14.626
Me, neither.

35:16.597 --> 35:18.930
Ohh, hey, kid.

35:21.134 --> 35:22.567
Did you guys like the play?

35:22.602 --> 35:24.769
Oh, yes, this is
a very talented prison.

35:24.805 --> 35:26.437
I know.
It's amazing.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.973
And can you believe Kill Face
built all those sets himself?

35:29.009 --> 35:31.475
Daddy,
when are you coming home?

35:31.511 --> 35:34.879
I don't know, but it's...
it's gonna be a while.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.380
But hopefully soon.

35:38.784 --> 35:40.284
Hey.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.820
I saw some cupcakes
on the snack table.

35:42.855 --> 35:43.821
Go get us one.

35:45.592 --> 35:49.093
You really shouldn't get
his hopes up like that.

35:49.128 --> 35:50.294
I'm not.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.330
I'm still going to get you
out of here.

35:52.365 --> 35:56.233
In fact, I think Peri had a big
secret, and that's why...

35:56.268 --> 35:59.269
Rosie, can we please
not talk about Peri?

35:59.304 --> 36:03.473
I just want to enjoy my time
here with you and Tucker, okay?

36:03.508 --> 36:06.777
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.
You're right.

36:06.812 --> 36:09.079
I've missed you so much.

36:15.787 --> 36:16.919
Where's our cupcake?

36:16.955 --> 36:18.154
They're all out.

36:18.189 --> 36:19.822
Ah.
[Chuckles]

36:21.693 --> 36:24.461
I wish Daddy could
come home with us.

36:24.496 --> 36:26.963
I'm working on it, <i>chiquito.</i>

36:29.400 --> 36:31.700
It's okay.
Close your eyes.

36:33.805 --> 36:35.304
We'll be home soon, huh?

36:38.376 --> 36:39.541

36:45.032 --> 36:47.532
Shouldn't you be
on your way to New York?

36:47.568 --> 36:50.169
I was headed to the airport
and I made the driver stop.

36:50.204 --> 36:54.506
Look, I feel awful
about what happened.

36:54.541 --> 36:57.208
You humiliated me in front of
those horrible men.

36:57.244 --> 36:59.278
I'm so sorry.

36:59.313 --> 37:01.313
But how could I tell
the shareholders

37:01.348 --> 37:04.349
that I chose a novice
screenwriter over Hugh Metzger?

37:04.385 --> 37:06.885
I get that. I do.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.120
But you said that
you had my back.

37:09.156 --> 37:11.122
What can I do
to make things better?

37:11.158 --> 37:13.457
I don't want to leave
with this unresolved.

37:13.493 --> 37:15.193

while your car waits outside.

It's work.

37:26.105 --> 37:27.471
Don't be that way.

You know what?
It's good that you're going.

Something wrong, James?

38:00.639 --> 38:02.339
I've been thinking.

38:02.374 --> 38:05.274
Me too. I believe I'm going
to have the soup tonight.

38:05.310 --> 38:07.877
It reminds me of the soup
kitchen where I volunteer

38:07.912 --> 38:10.547
when I'm not donating blood
or reading to the blind.

38:10.582 --> 38:11.514
We need to talk.

- Evelyn.
- [Sighs] It's all right.

"We need to talk" means.

- You do?
- You don't need to pretend.

You're a better person
than I am.

to be with me, either.
