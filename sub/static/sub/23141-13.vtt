a sock on the cockpit door?Don't cockpit-block me.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.797
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.589
Rock. Paper. Scissors. Shoot!

00:24.633 --> 00:26.548
Oh-ho! Rock beats scissors.
I win.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.680
These aren't scissors, it's how
many months rent you owe me.

00:32.554 --> 00:36.775
I was hoping it was you.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.604
That's not how this works.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.476
This is my boyfriend,
who called because he missed me.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.305
Yes, that is totally the reason
why I called,

00:44.348 --> 00:46.263
but also this.

00:46.307 --> 00:49.223
Is there anything you can do
about that?

00:49.266 --> 00:50.702
I'm sorry, I can't help.

00:50.746 --> 00:54.271
Jackpot's official position is,
"You do you. We've seen worse."

00:54.315 --> 00:56.273
Well, if this is what I have
to put up with to see you

00:56.317 --> 00:57.405
for the next three days,
it's worth it.

00:57.448 --> 01:00.190
-It's probably worth it.
-It is.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.713
I'm so excited.
This is your first time

01:01.757 --> 01:03.367
staying in L.A. with me.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.848
You finally get to see me in
my element, outside of work.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.545
And once I peel off
these sanitary gloves,

01:07.589 --> 01:09.330
it's all fun all the time.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.071
You're not wearing gloves.

01:11.114 --> 01:14.509
Oh, my God. I-I touched
the bathroom door.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.867
Can you believe this guy?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.042
PILOT :

Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

♪

01:34.442 --> 01:37.401
Ah, thanks again for letting
Bryan stay this week, Bernard.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.925
And, don't worry, we're barely
going to be home.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.406
I have a jam-packed few days
planned. Look.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.147
I have a list.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.280
"Paddleboarding"?
"Hiking to the Hollywood sign"?

01:46.323 --> 01:47.368
"Yoga at Griffith Park"?

01:47.411 --> 01:49.413
You don't do any
of these things.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.894
No, but they're things
I want to do.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.810
Okay, fine. They're things
I wantto want to do.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.291
Look, this week is a big
relationship test for me.

01:57.334 --> 02:00.468
Bryan is going to see my real
life outside of this plane.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.383
I don't want to give off
any red flags

02:02.426 --> 02:05.386
that might make him second-guess
our whole relationship.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.909
Yes, like when I first
saw Tristane

02:06.952 --> 02:09.694
wearing flip-flops to dinner.
Slide away, child...

02:09.738 --> 02:11.914
I'm just trying to put
my best foot forward.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.395
Honey, I get it,
but this ain't your foot.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.180
A linguine tour? That's not you.
I mean, look,

02:17.224 --> 02:20.052
this whole list is written on
an old Taco Bell receipt.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.446
A 10:00 a.m. Taco Bell receipt.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.795
They serve breakfast now,
Bernard.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.580
You had three burritos
and a cup of cheese.

02:25.623 --> 02:28.452
Breakfast cheese.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.332
the destination for premium
business-casual ponchos.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.725
Half blanket and half shirt.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.771
They're the beautiful biracial
baby of women's fashion.

Check out a sample

How'd you like the plug
for your store, babe?

02:54.609 --> 02:57.829
Loved it. Next time,
could you mention our new

02:57.873 --> 03:00.354
Frances McDormand signature collection of shapeless apparel

03:00.397 --> 03:02.225
for middle school art teachers?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.358
Anything for you.
I'll call you when I land.

03:04.401 --> 03:07.970
Hey! Can I keep this?

03:08.013 --> 03:10.190
It hides all my problem areas.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.541
Yeah. Patricia has a such an eye
for sensible coverwear.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.457
-Hmm.
-God, she's amazing.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.371
Alan, can I tell you a secret?

03:17.414 --> 03:19.808
:
Do not blow this, Alan.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.201
Yes.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.637
I think Patricia
might be the one.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.117
-But I thought the sky...
She was.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.685
But let's face it, Alan,
that's just stuff losers say

03:27.729 --> 03:28.860
when they're not getting laid.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.342
Ooh, I've heard that's
a good book.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.605
Ask me, did I ever read
Joan Didion?

03:34.649 --> 03:37.391
Okay. Have you ever read
Joan Didion?

03:37.434 --> 03:39.915
Ask me didI ever read
Joan Didion?

03:39.958 --> 03:42.352
Didyou ever read Joan Didion?

03:42.396 --> 03:44.354
No, I Didion't.

03:44.398 --> 03:47.096
Hi, I'm Colin...
and of course I did.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.273
NICHOLE:
Colin, what's up?

03:50.317 --> 03:52.536
That's the third woman
I've seen you talk at today.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.582
-You can't blitz
on every down, man. -I know.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.279
I'm just... I'm trying to put
myself out there a bit more.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.020
You know, I haven't met anybody
in ages,

03:58.063 --> 04:00.152
and I can't keep holding out
for Ronnie.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.329
Smart move. And I'd lock down
somebody quickly.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.113
British men age like that
Hemingway quote--

04:04.156 --> 04:06.985
"slowly, then all at once."

04:07.029 --> 04:09.466
Ooh! Ask me, did I ever
read Hemingway?

04:09.510 --> 04:10.815
Do you wantto die alone?

04:14.471 --> 04:16.256
I think he's gonna...
Oh, Bernard!

04:16.299 --> 04:18.867
I was thinking,
and you were right.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.434
I want to show Bryan
the best version of me,

04:20.477 --> 04:22.610
but none of the things I planned
were actually me,

04:22.653 --> 04:25.352
so I talked to Nichole, and she
knew exactly what I needed.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.876
-A new bra.
-Finally!

04:27.919 --> 04:28.920
-No! The other thing.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.357
-A dinner party!
-Oh.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.184
At my house?
No, thank you.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.926
Bernard, I need to do something
where I can be relaxed

04:34.970 --> 04:37.146
and confident, and I cannot
spend the next few days

04:37.189 --> 04:38.408
pretending I like going
to those art zoos.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.453
NICHOLE and BERNARD:
Museums.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.368
It'll be small and tasteful.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.500
I promise. Just a few friends
that I want Bryan to meet.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.502
All right,
I will allow this party.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.678
You may invite your gaggle
of Kelseys and Callies

04:47.722 --> 04:49.724
and other girls whose names
pumpkin when they turn 30.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.334
Yay! We're gonna have a dinner.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.380
You still need a new bra,
though.

04:53.423 --> 04:56.557
This dinner party sounds great.
What time you need me?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.603
Oh, I'm sorry, Dave, I'm trying
to keep this separate from work.

04:59.647 --> 05:00.691
Come on, Ronnie. Tonight was
gonna be the night

05:00.735 --> 05:02.389
I ask Patricia to be exclusive.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.913
I want it to be special and
in front of people required

05:04.956 --> 05:06.828
to applaud because
I'm their boss.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.178
Okay. Dave, you're invited,
but please do not do that thing

05:09.221 --> 05:10.527
where you wear too much cologne.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.921
It's not too much.
It's too many.

05:12.964 --> 05:17.969
I layer musk, citrus,
sandalwood, musk, musk.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.408
Hey, Nichole. I waited all week.

05:21.451 --> 05:25.368
Why have you still not responded
to my e

05:25.412 --> 05:27.936
I didn't get an e-mail from you.
What did you send me?

05:27.979 --> 05:29.329
A screenplay!

05:29.372 --> 05:32.593
Turns out some of my juices
are creative.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.551
-I've written a movie.
-Mm-hmm.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.337
And, as a friend,
I would like you to read it.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.947
I would be honored.
Send it to me again.

05:38.990 --> 05:39.991
Do you have my right e

05:40.035 --> 05:42.559
Nichole@email.stripper.

05:42.603 --> 05:45.910
No. That's not my or...
anyone's e-mail.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.565
Email.stripper@Nichole.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.740
That's even further.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.832
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends!

05:54.876 --> 05:56.791
Callie works at this fancy
Italian market...

05:56.834 --> 05:58.619
...so you can talk about how
everyone mispronounces

05:58.662 --> 05:59.533
"mozzarella" or whatever.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.622
It's actually "moo-tza-rell."

06:01.665 --> 06:03.101
Can you just give me one minute?

06:03.145 --> 06:05.887
Yeah, I got to wash the Jackpot
off my hands anyway.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.368
Nichole! Kelsey and Callie
just texted me.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.760
They're not coming.
They both came down

06:09.804 --> 06:11.109
with a case of greyscale.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.589
That's a rare disease
from a fake world.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.243
What a terrible lie.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.810
To be fair,
it's the same lie I used

06:15.853 --> 06:18.465
to get out of both their baby
showers, but what am I gonna do?

06:18.508 --> 06:20.031
They were my most
interesting friends.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.946
I needed them for
cultured conversation.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.079
Bernard, will you talk to Bryan
about cheese?

06:24.122 --> 06:25.776
I will scream at Bryan
about cheese!

06:25.820 --> 06:28.475
Wait, I have an idea. Colin?
What are you doing tonight?

06:28.518 --> 06:31.086
Funny you should ask.
Some online pals and I plan

06:31.129 --> 06:33.001
to debate who's the best Doctor
from Doctor Who...

06:33.044 --> 06:34.785
Instead, you should come
to Ronnie's dinner party

06:34.829 --> 06:36.483
and talk about literally
anything else.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.702
Oh, a dinner party.
The modern-day salon,

06:38.746 --> 06:40.661
as it were--
a meeting of minds and mouths.

06:40.704 --> 06:41.792
-Never mind.
-No, no, please let me come.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.228
I'd like to come.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.970
Did I hear something about
a party of dinners?

06:46.014 --> 06:48.103
I assume I am invited,

06:48.146 --> 06:50.975
because you can't spell "party"
without "Arty."

06:51.019 --> 06:53.064
Oh, I don't know, Artem.
I'm not sure it's your scene.

06:53.108 --> 06:57.242
Yeah, right. I only swam across
two oceans to get to America,

06:57.286 --> 07:00.724
so, yeah, I guess I'm not a very
interesting dinner guest.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.465
Okay, fine!
You can come tonight, Artem.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.902
-Artem.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.469
Okay, because it sounded like
you might have said

07:06.513 --> 07:08.036
-Artem orAlan.
-It was Artem.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.080
'Cause there's
a lot of similarities

07:09.124 --> 07:10.125
between Artem and Alan...

07:10.168 --> 07:11.735
You know damn well
she said Artem!

07:11.779 --> 07:13.737
Okay, it's fine.
You can come tonight.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.696
-Yes!
-You can all come.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.220
Just figure out
what you're gonna bring.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.483
Well, we have our guest list.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.486
-Calling pharmacies

07:23.530 --> 07:25.836
to see if they sell Purell
by the keg.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
I have to admit,
I'm impressed.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.021
You have hors d'oeuvres,
tasteful napkins,

07:37.065 --> 07:39.415
and you showered and didn't just
dump baby powder on your roots.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.200
You see that, Bernard? I'm a
regular Barefoot Contestant.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.334
Uh, will you excuse me?

07:45.377 --> 07:47.641
You-You don't have to drink
Artem's wine.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.686
-I've got fancy stuff.
-No, it's okay.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.558
It's Diane Keaton's new wine.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.385
Look, there's a cute
little turtleneck.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.692
Hey, did you ever see
Something's Gotta Give?

07:55.736 --> 07:59.217
It's a wonderful movie about
Diane Keaton's kitchen greed.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.481
No, no, no.
That's It's Complicated.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.134
Something's Gotta Give
is where she dates

08:03.178 --> 08:04.745
her daughter's ex-boyfriend.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.921
Oh, that iscomplicated.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.880
No, no.
It...

08:09.924 --> 08:11.491
You know what?
Just pour me some more wine.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.754
-All the way to the top.
-Good.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.236
-Hey! Welcome to my...

08:18.280 --> 08:19.890
Bernard'sapartment!

08:19.934 --> 08:21.109
:
Oh, what a smashing flat!

08:21.152 --> 08:22.763
Good show, Bernard.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.592
What is that? Why are you
playing up the British thing?

08:25.635 --> 08:28.159
There it is. You brought a date.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.510
Well, I wasn't planning on it,
but, uh, then Talia and I had

08:30.553 --> 08:32.860
a cinema-quality meet-cute,
and, uh, here we are.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.166
-Just on an app.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.733
Mmm, Tinder

08:36.777 --> 08:39.170
Uber.
I drove him here.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.607
Mint?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.347
Thank you for your vote,
Councilman.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.306
As the Deputy Mayor,
I'm taking the lead on this,

08:44.349 --> 08:46.526
and I don't forget my friends.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.310
-Ah...

08:48.353 --> 08:50.660
We have a big vote tomorrow
about whether to start

08:50.704 --> 08:53.707
watering the Calabasas medians
with potable water.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.665
Some people just love drinking
from sprinklers.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.755
Not me.
I think all water's gross.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.931
So, I've been meaning to ask.

09:00.975 --> 09:05.109
We might some new people
tonight, and I wasn't sure...

09:05.153 --> 09:06.937
You can call me
your girlfriend, Dave.

09:06.981 --> 09:10.158
Yes! I guess that makes tonight
our coming out party.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.029
Let's show Bernard
how it's really done.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.902
Oh, I'm vibrating.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.817
-Uh, yeah.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.428
Hey, you think tonight we could
just put our phones away

09:19.471 --> 09:21.865
and... focus on us?

09:21.909 --> 09:25.826
Absolutely, Dave.
Tonight, I am all yours.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.964
Nichole!
Do not keep me in suspense.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.966
-Uh-huh.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.838
Uh-huh... Hey, wait!

09:37.881 --> 09:40.362
Can you tell me
what was your favorite part?

09:40.405 --> 09:41.972
-Well...
-Oh, yes, the well.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.366
Oh, that is a good scene,

09:44.409 --> 09:46.760
and I know just the well
to shoot it in.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.936
What else did you like?

09:48.979 --> 09:51.808
Artem, I have to be honest,
I didn't like any of it.

09:51.852 --> 09:54.245
After I read it, I actually
deleted it off my phone

09:54.289 --> 09:56.683
and then switched carriers
so it couldn't find me.

09:56.726 --> 09:59.903
You read it on your phone?
Oh, that's the problem.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.992
And it's not meant
for the little screen.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.733
You must read it
on the big screen.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.169
The screen wasn't
the problem, Artem.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.562
It didn't make any sense.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.129
But it's based on my life.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.173
There were werewolves in it.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.261
Yeah, that was embellishment.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.612
In real life
it was just dog men.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.831
Ah, I'm sorry Artem.
I need to steal her.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.790
-Yeah...
-Thank God!

10:16.833 --> 10:18.443
Um... Dave is here
with your mom.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.880
Does she still think
we're dating,

10:19.923 --> 10:22.273
because I have guests
to entertain, dinner to prepare.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.232
I can't be a fake lesbian
on top of all that.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.755
Don't worry, I told her
we broke up a while ago.

10:25.799 --> 10:26.843
Oh! Good.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.192
I said your drinking
was out of hand

10:28.236 --> 10:29.541
and that you were
a selfish lover.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.196
Well, maybe the drinking
just makes me tired.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.242
Ronnie.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.768
Not judging, but when does
the dinner part

10:38.812 --> 10:39.769
of this dinner party start?

10:39.813 --> 10:40.944
We're out of hors d'oeuvres.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.859
Artem ate all the blankets
off the pigs.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.732
Now I'm full, and you are cold.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.777
We can eat now.
I just have to heat up dinner.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.040
It'll take five minutes.
I got Blue Apron.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.086
To be clear, do you think
there's a fully cooked dinner

10:52.129 --> 10:53.914
in that Blue Apron box?

10:53.957 --> 10:56.786
Yes. It's a gourmet meal
delivery service, Bernard.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.920
Wait. Before you open that,
let me grab my wine.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.010
Okay.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.752
Proceed.

11:07.362 --> 11:11.061
!
-Yes, this pairs very well.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.933
You have to cook?! No!

11:12.976 --> 11:14.282
I thought this came
already prepared.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.676
Why the hell would I pay
to cook my own dinner?

11:16.719 --> 11:17.807
I don't have time for this.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.679
You are sleeping with a chef.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.681
No. I can't ask him to help.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.987
This-this whole thing was
to prove that I am responsible

11:24.031 --> 11:26.511
and sophisticated and...

11:26.555 --> 11:28.426
I'm fine.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.906
You go stall
and entertain Bryan,

11:29.950 --> 11:31.778
while I put all this together.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.518
Stall?
Ronnie, I don't stall.

11:33.562 --> 11:37.479
When I entertain it's an event,
a sacrament, an occasion.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.960
At worst, a moment.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.744
-Hey, Alan, can you
give us a sec?

11:41.788 --> 11:42.963
Patty and I are gonna
take our first

11:43.006 --> 11:44.791
official relationship selfie.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.967
-It's our social media debut.
-Aw. -Oh.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.883
Hold on. Let me fix my hair.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.015
As a public figure,
I have to look appropriate

11:52.059 --> 11:54.931
and hide my hands so no one
Photoshops a penis into them.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.803
Ugh. Disgusting.
We can shoot a car into space,

11:56.846 --> 11:58.935
but we can't think of a better
place to Photoshop a penis?

11:58.979 --> 12:00.850
Oh, sweetie. Come here.
Get in this picture.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.939
-She's a big hit with the base.
-Oh.

12:02.983 --> 12:06.160
-Here we go.
-Yeah, sure.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.205
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.818
Oh, Bernard!
Come here, come here.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.820
He checks off a lot of boxes.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.431
-Just smile for the camera.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.346
Oh. Why didn't you say so?

12:18.389 --> 12:20.740
I-It's hard to get
all four of us to fit.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.002
Just... this way a little bit.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.787
Perfect.

12:24.831 --> 12:25.919
Nice.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.835
-Your skin is incredible.
-I like the...

12:35.580 --> 12:37.147
Oh, my God!
What happened to the dinner?

12:37.191 --> 12:38.801
The recipe was
gonna take too long,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.455
and I don't know
what to do with a game hen.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.370
So I'm just doing what we do
in Bakersfield

12:42.413 --> 12:45.895
and turning a bunch of things
into a casserole.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.375
Ronnie, that looks like
something already ate it.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.159
I know.
That's why I need your help.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.814
Grab some of that food. Try
to make it look like a salad.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.469
Avocado, honey, oatmeal...
Where'd you get all this from?

12:54.512 --> 12:56.993
-I raided your beauty drawer.
-My quail eggs.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.473
I also raided
your earthquake kit.

12:58.516 --> 12:59.648
My preserved quail eggs!

12:59.691 --> 13:01.084
Sorry, Bernard.
Don't be mad.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.433
Well, now I can't get mad.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.739
I don't have anything
to smooth the lines.

13:06.437 --> 13:10.615
Hey. Bryan, tell Nichole
what you just told me.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.009
Please don't come into the
bathroom while I'm using it.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.358
No, after that.

13:14.402 --> 13:15.838
You see, I told him the idea

13:15.882 --> 13:17.231
of my movie and he said...

13:17.274 --> 13:19.059
Sounds interesting.
Please get out.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.191
Interesting,
like the movie Get Out.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.889
Artem, I didn't like it.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.673
I thought friends
were supposed to be honest.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.197
Friends are supposed to focus
on the positives.

13:27.241 --> 13:30.374
Like when I tell Bryan,
"Oh, that's a nice shirt,"

13:30.418 --> 13:33.638
but never ask,
"Why stupid bracelet?"

13:33.682 --> 13:36.032
Come on.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.947
I was just trying to pee.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.210
Hey, Patricia.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.386
So we never actually got
to take that picture before,

13:42.430 --> 13:43.910
if you want to take it now.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.694
No big deal.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.479
-Full disclosure, I want to.
It's a big deal. -Oh.

13:48.523 --> 13:53.223
You're right. Let's do it.
Let's take it. Right now.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.444
Um... Oh, my God.
We lost two more votes.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.489
My non-potable bill's
not gonna pass.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.840
I'm sorry.
I have to deal with this.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.454
I'll take a picture
with you, Dave.

14:06.497 --> 14:09.065
Shut up, Alan.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.067
All right,
two regular, one silly.

14:11.111 --> 14:14.854
Okay, and this is my
children's book Fish and Chips.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.900
-Oh. -It's two cops,
Carl Fish and Wesley Chips.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.206
That's so cute.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.598
Are you happy
with the temperature?

14:20.642 --> 14:21.773
I can make it warmer.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.297
I'm good.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.995
Now here they are uncovering
a cache of stolen art.

14:26.039 --> 14:29.912
The twist is, you see,
that Chips is the fish.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.522
Oh, your battery's almost dead.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.133
Here, I have a charger.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.874
Oh.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.788
Hey, Colin.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.661
I don't want to be a bummer, but
I've been watching your date.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.751
Are you sure you're her date,
and not still her passenger?

14:42.794 --> 14:44.274
Yeah, of course it's a date.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.798
What, do you see any entry-level
hybrids around here?

14:46.842 --> 14:48.844
Okay. But I'd check the app
if I were you,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.672
because she's being
tip-conscious level nice,

14:50.715 --> 14:53.066
and you're cute, but not
"pick up an Uber driver" cute.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.155
Thank you for the ego-bruising
concern, but I've...

15:00.160 --> 15:02.684
Okay, Bernard,
what do you think?

15:02.727 --> 15:04.555
It needs more eye cream.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.122
Ronnie, we need to talk.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.994
Oh, don't worry, Dave.
Dinner will be ready any minute.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.734
No, I came to say
we have to delay dinner.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.999
Patricia is still on the phone.
Tonight has been a bust.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.304
You seem like
you're really stressed.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.958
Why don't you put
all that stuff down

15:16.002 --> 15:18.091
-Ronnie, quick question.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.049
I'm trying to log on
to my Uber account for, um,

15:20.093 --> 15:22.530
-nothing, but I can't seem
to get a Wi-Fi signal. -Yeah.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.227
Bernard doesn't allow any type
of waves in the apartment.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.229
He says it's bad for aging.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.970
Well, now we're eating
the last line of my defense,

15:28.014 --> 15:29.754
so just put the cell tower
right on my face.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.365
Okay, if you're not
in the kitchen helping,

15:31.408 --> 15:34.498
-Ronnie! You have me sitting

15:34.542 --> 15:37.153
next to Nichole,
so I need to switch seats.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.285
What is the problem now?

15:38.328 --> 15:39.851
She doesn't respect me

15:39.895 --> 15:42.245
as a friend nor as an artist.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.290
-Oh, so you're an artist now.
-Yes.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.727
You can't spell "artist"
without "Arty."

15:45.770 --> 15:47.120
Fine. If you want to be
a baby about this,

15:47.163 --> 15:48.295
then I don't want
to sit next to you, either.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.949
Colin, will you
switch seats with me?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.211
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I have a window seat.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.386
I don't like the middle.

15:52.429 --> 15:54.083
Hey, Dave, why don't you
deal with this?

15:54.127 --> 15:55.911
I'm sorry, everyone.
I know you're all hungry

15:55.955 --> 15:58.305
and want to get on our food,
but there's been a minor delay.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.089
We're still waiting on Patricia
to come in from the hall.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.612
Once she's arrived at her seat,

16:01.656 --> 16:03.179
we'll have this dinner
up and running.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.747
-No. There will be no delay.
-Um, Ronnie.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.749
-Oh, Dame Judi Dench!

16:07.792 --> 16:10.708
Oh, no! Why didn't
the smoke detector go off?

16:10.752 --> 16:12.275
Oh, I tampered with
and/or disabled it

16:12.319 --> 16:14.930
-so I could smoke a J.
Really?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.454
The deputy mayor of Calabasas
is out there, man.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.282
-Oh, i-it's fine.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.023
I have everything under control.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.112
Is the smoke bothering you?
Should I open a window?

16:23.156 --> 16:24.331
Ronnie, I really need
that Wi-Fi.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.950
Oh, everybody get out or we are
cancelling this flight!

16:34.994 --> 16:36.212
Flight?

16:36.256 --> 16:39.520
Oh, my God.
That's what this is.

16:39.563 --> 16:43.219
Bernard and I serving you while
dealing with your problems.

16:43.263 --> 16:46.135
Trying to manage Dave,
getting complaints about Wi-Fi.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.051
Yeah, for normal reasons.
A sports game.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.053
I wanted to throw
this dinner party

16:51.097 --> 16:52.446
to show Bryan my life,

16:52.489 --> 16:54.535
and I guess this is it.

16:54.578 --> 16:57.842
It's one never-ending flight.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.410
Well, I have to put up
with that at 30,000 feet,

17:00.454 --> 17:03.631
but I don't have to do it here,
and I can finally do something

17:03.674 --> 17:07.156
that I have always wanted
and just leave.

17:08.201 --> 17:11.421
Ha! She thinks that
was a dramatic exit.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.684
This is a dramatic exit.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.514
Bernie does it again.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.698
Hey. Can I hide
in here with you?

17:27.742 --> 17:29.178
Artem's trying
to lighten the mood

17:29.222 --> 17:31.267
by acting out scenes
from his movie.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.923
It's an action musical,
in case you were wondering.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.186
Still not sure
what language it's in.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.232
I'm sorry about tonight.

17:39.275 --> 17:42.148
I wanted to show you
this other side of me,

17:42.191 --> 17:44.411
but I've realized
I'm out of sides.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.935
Right now, you get the choice
between two Ronnies:

17:46.978 --> 17:49.329
the Ronnie who spends
60 hours a week in the sky

17:49.372 --> 17:50.591
fixing other people's problems,

17:50.634 --> 17:53.028
or the Ronnie so exhausted
from doing that,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.900
she can't even finish
this heartfelt whatever.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.338
Well, let me finish
this heartfelt whatever.

17:58.381 --> 18:01.123
Those are the only
two Ronnies I need.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.344
Oh, good, because we both
like you, too.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.389
Also, I was hoping to get
the recipe for that casserole

18:06.433 --> 18:07.521
to serve at my restaurant.

18:07.564 --> 18:08.696
-No.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.219
:
No.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.916
Oh, I thought
you would laugh at that.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.396
But seriously,
we need to figure out

18:13.440 --> 18:15.311
what else to feed
all these people.

18:16.747 --> 18:19.533
RONNIE:
Dinner tonight

18:19.576 --> 18:21.317
will have an
international flair.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.755
Special thanks to Bernard
for allowing this many carbs

18:24.799 --> 18:26.366
and saturated fats
into his home.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.629
Yes, I've always enjoyed
eating foods

18:28.672 --> 18:31.197
that are given out for free
if a team makes free throws.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.937
Well, I think it's great.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.723
-And don't worry, I'll handle
beverage service. -Oh.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.464
I have to use the restroom.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.683
Is there a specific way
you want me to go?

18:39.727 --> 18:40.989
Oh, for...

18:44.732 --> 18:46.168
Yeah, I'm just curious.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.431
Have you ever been waterboarded
with non

18:48.475 --> 18:51.173
Welcome to my childhood.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.263
-You can't play games.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.960
If you want to get
anywhere with my mom,

18:56.004 --> 18:57.658
you have to be focused,
direct and honest.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.268
Doesn't she still think
you're a lesbian?

18:59.312 --> 19:00.139
Don't be a dick, Dave.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.360
Hey, Artem.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.232
So, I'm really sorry
about before.

19:06.275 --> 19:09.583
Oh, Nichole, I'm sorry.
I-I know, I overreacted.

19:09.626 --> 19:12.107
I asked you
for your honest opinion

19:12.151 --> 19:13.761
and thank you
for giving it to me.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.197
Thank you for
letting me read it.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.373
It takes guts to show
your art to somebody.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.724
Which, actually, you inspired me
to show you something creative

19:20.768 --> 19:21.899
I've been working on.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.074
Uh, they're sketches

19:23.118 --> 19:24.902
from when I was
interested in fashion.

19:24.946 --> 19:28.167
I've been playing with dress
designs. What do you think?

19:28.210 --> 19:32.388
Uh, you want my honest opinion
or supportive friend opinion?

19:32.432 --> 19:34.825
-The second one.
-I love them.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.354
What is it?

19:41.397 --> 19:44.487
Okay, look. Do you want me
in the front or the back?

19:44.531 --> 19:46.141
That's not a euphemism.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
It's just, if I sit
in the front, this was a date.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.928
If I sit in the back,
it was just a really long ride.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.582
No, of course it was a date.

19:52.626 --> 19:56.499
-I stopped charging you as soon
as you asked me in. -Fantastic!

19:56.543 --> 19:58.327
So do you want to go back
to your place?

19:58.371 --> 20:01.504
Okay, just to be clear,
are you asking as an Uber or...

20:01.548 --> 20:04.290
I'm asking as a woman who'd
like to take your clothes off.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.075
In that case,
I will take a mint.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.338
So, you make dinner
for people every night.

20:09.382 --> 20:13.255
Not even people-- strangers.
That's your job.

20:13.299 --> 20:15.388
Worse than my job,
it's my passion.

20:15.431 --> 20:18.478
Seems terrible. I think
my dinner party days are over.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.655
Well, maybe you'll have better
luck with them at our apartment.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.309
What?

20:23.352 --> 20:24.962
I've been thinking...

20:25.006 --> 20:29.097
I want you to move to Las Vegas
and live with me.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.405
BERNARD:
Ronnie, I'm stepping out.

20:32.448 --> 20:35.059
But if the doorbell rings,
please answer it.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.801
It's my interior designer
Le Marque Bougelet.

20:37.845 --> 20:41.718
He'll be burning everything.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.329
Thank you.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.896
Good news.
Got the votes.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.203
Ah, those hose water junkies

20:48.247 --> 20:50.553
are gonna have to pay for their
water, like nature intended.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.556
Honestly, Patty, I don't care
how portable your water is,

20:53.600 --> 20:55.906
all I wanted was
one picture with you,

20:55.950 --> 20:57.517
and you couldn't
even give me that.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.606
I thought tonight was about us
taking a step forward

20:59.649 --> 21:00.911
in our relationship.

21:00.955 --> 21:03.087
Look, my job comes first.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.480
Of all people,
I thought you'd understand.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.090
You and the sky.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.658
I'm ready to put the sky
aside for you.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.182
And I thought you would do
the same for me.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.315
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.404
I mean, I like the way
my life is right now

21:15.448 --> 21:17.145
and how you fit in it.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.931
I don't want to waste my time
being a co-pilot in your life.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.804
I don't think
this is gonna work.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.327
Good-bye, Patricia.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.598
That was fast.

21:39.167 --> 21:42.649
Hey, Dave, she missed out on a
lot of fares tonight, so, um...

21:42.692 --> 21:44.825
Who cares? Take me
to the nearest high school.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.348
I'm gonna lie
on the 50-yard line

21:46.392 --> 21:48.394
and talk about
where it all went wrong.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.575
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:58.578 --> 22:00.449
You've hit the jackpot withLA to Vegas.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.582
Now here are a few more shows to check out from Fox.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.542
911. What's your emergency?

22:06.586 --> 22:09.371
MAN : I'm on Flight 46, and we're going down.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.113
Just tell my wife I'm so sorry that I cannot come home to you.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.201
Hello?

22:15.377 --> 22:18.293
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:19.860 --> 22:21.078
Rapid response now!

22:21.122 --> 22:23.994
-We can't save everyone.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.345
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
