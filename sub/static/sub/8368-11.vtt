03:35.983 --> 03:37.183

03:37.218 --> 03:38.952
Let's see which races
you'll have available

03:38.986 --> 03:41.121
to choose from
for this challenge.

03:42.323 --> 03:46.192
[gasps]
Worgen.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.228
Aw, this is so cool.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.365
So start with goblins.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.601
They're super snarky
and exuberant.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.302
They love explosives and fire,

03:56.337 --> 03:58.571
which may not necessarily always
work out for them.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.240
Next to these guys,
you have the Draenei.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.109
This is an alien race that's
really just all about protection

04:03.144 --> 04:05.078
and making sure
that people are okay.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.346
Then we have Pandaren.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.882
They're all about martial arts
and home/family,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.750
but what they really love
is brewing good ale

04:10.785 --> 04:12.752
and drinking good ale.

04:12.787 --> 04:13.953
Next we have the Tauren.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.188
They use druidic magic

04:15.222 --> 04:17.423
to protect their family
and the world of Azeroth.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.492
Trolls are super cool.
They're very laid-back.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.994
But they're super-fierce
warriors.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.630
Kind of think of them as
the headhunters of the islands.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.098
And then finally
we have the Worgens.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.034
They actually originated from an
ancient curse that turned them

04:28.068 --> 04:30.203
into these werewolf-like
creatures ages ago.

04:30.237 --> 04:33.573
They are super bloodthirsty,
destructive, ferocious beasts.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.707
So cool.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.109
- Oh, my God.

to ask you some questions.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.165
Sure.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.500
For the hair, can it be, like,

06:07.535 --> 06:09.636
a mix of green, blue, and purple
instead of just red,

06:09.670 --> 06:11.237
or is stepping away from red
a mistake?

06:11.272 --> 06:13.773
Is their hair always down,
or can it be sort of styled?

06:13.807 --> 06:15.675
Can the hair, like,
stick up less in the front?

06:15.709 --> 06:16.776
Can it be, like, that high?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.044
- You took a lot of notes.
- Yes.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.612
Okay, trolls are proud
of their hair,

06:19.647 --> 06:21.147
so they definitely really
show it off.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.348
<i>Some of 'em braid it.</i>

06:22.383 --> 06:23.750
<i>Some of 'em have it swept back.</i>

06:23.784 --> 06:25.652
Personally, I'd pick a color
that's offset well

06:25.686 --> 06:27.153
against the skin tone.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.855
Okay. I'm really glad I
wrote all these questions down.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.290
I would have never remembered.

06:30.324 --> 06:31.758
- I got the Worgen.
- Okay.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.160
And I don't know the classes
that the Worgen can play.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.764
<i>Basically, it's mage, priest,
druid, and warlock.</i>

06:37.798 --> 06:39.299
- Oh, you can do druid.
- Yeah.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.633
So I used to play as a druid,

06:40.668 --> 06:42.569
so I'm a little bit
more familiar with that.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.170
<i>Then I might go the magic route,</i>

06:44.204 --> 06:46.005
<i>'cause that's what I would play
if I were playing it.</i>

06:46.040 --> 06:47.840
Definitely I'd think
about the silhouette pose,

06:47.875 --> 06:49.442
to read that snout
and the muzzle.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.911
I'm going to have to keep it
shorter so I can use her teeth,

06:51.946 --> 06:54.080
but I'm hoping that if I
extend the wig back,

06:54.114 --> 06:55.648
that it would help create
that profile.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.816
That's a good idea.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.985
And then I might make paw feet

06:59.019 --> 07:00.653
so if they stick out
underneath the robes,

07:00.688 --> 07:02.555
that you can see that,
and then claw hands.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.591
Yeah, if you really want
to double down on the claws

07:04.625 --> 07:06.593
and make those nice
and burly and long, cool.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.994
I'm very excited
about this challenge.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.128
This is very awesome.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.530
So you got Draenei, man.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.532
- Yeah, he seems pretty cool.
- Yeah.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.534
I'm gonna try
and fabricate the tail

07:14.568 --> 07:16.002
into the tentacles that he has.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.371
Try to maybe not get too much
texture in the tentacles.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.173
I think that could potentially
distract from

07:20.207 --> 07:21.641
some of the forehead detail.
Right.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.843
In terms of class, I would
probably say death knight.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.212
Yeah, I did really like
the way his face looks.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.414
Death knights have their own
custom lighter skin tone,

07:28.449 --> 07:30.617
because they essentially
have died and come back to life

07:30.651 --> 07:31.651
to serve the Lich King.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.986
They're not really a zombie.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.121
They're just, like, an undead
version of the Draenei.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.290
So it is pale.
It's just, like, hints of blues.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.524
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.059
- So Tauren, huh?
- Yep.

07:40.094 --> 07:43.363
<i>I was thinking of doing
a elderly shaman type.</i>

07:43.397 --> 07:44.731
That's cool.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.532
I'm gonna shrink that side
profile down a little bit.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.835
Cool. You may want to consider
some kind of a back form,

07:48.869 --> 07:50.870
because the hump's their most
important feature.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.505
And yeah, man, just big horns.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.073
If you can pull that off,
that could be styling.

07:54.108 --> 07:56.376
And I want to do
the three-fingered hands

07:56.410 --> 07:57.744
smaller and more realistic.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.312
Yeah. No, that makes
a lot of sense.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.714
- So I have the goblin.
- All right.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.416
My model is female.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.884
I don't know
if there's a difference

08:04.918 --> 08:06.152
between the male and female.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.388
Oh, yeah, the females
are less rough-edged

08:08.422 --> 08:09.522
<i>than the male goblins are.</i>

08:09.556 --> 08:11.124
<i>- They're super cute.
- Okay.</i>

08:11.158 --> 08:12.825
See how she's got,
like, upturned nose,

08:12.860 --> 08:14.494
big lips, great big eyes?

08:14.528 --> 08:16.429
Do you figure it'd be

27:00.566 --> 27:02.500
16 hours every single day

27:02.534 --> 27:04.969
sitting there in my underpants
playing World of Warcraft.

27:05.003 --> 27:07.972
It was probably the single best
year of my entire life, so...

27:08.006 --> 27:09.240
- I bet.
- Yeah.

27:09.274 --> 27:11.075
It means a lot to me, this game.

27:11.110 --> 27:12.877
Well, that doesn't make me
nervous at all.

27:12.911 --> 27:14.512
All right, are you ready
to see some makeups?

27:14.546 --> 27:15.747
I am.

27:15.781 --> 27:17.215
Let's take a look
at your creations.

and it's frustrating,</i>

because I wasn't able
to complete my vision.

28:06.231 --> 28:08.366

28:34.159 --> 28:35.460

28:35.494 --> 28:37.061
<i>My Tauren is not finished,</i>

28:37.095 --> 28:42.066

it looks like the video game.

29:00.886 --> 29:03.287

like what I did</i>

29:31.783 --> 29:34.051
and they're happy
they used the immunity on me.

29:38.457 --> 29:39.824
All right, judges,
why don't you go ahead

29:39.858 --> 29:41.692
and take a closer look?

29:46.231 --> 29:48.699
The paint work
to me just feels so synthetic.

29:48.734 --> 29:51.502
It's probably because of
the extra sheen she put on it.

29:51.537 --> 29:52.837
They're a bit grimier than this,

29:52.871 --> 29:54.539
a bit more torn up.

29:54.573 --> 29:56.641
You know, for a goblin,
she looks pretty.

29:59.378 --> 30:03.314
Wow. Walter did
some serious stuff here today.

30:03.348 --> 30:05.950
It feels right on the nose.

30:05.984 --> 30:09.387
The accuracy
from the tentacles on the face...

30:09.421 --> 30:10.855
it's very, very good.

30:10.889 --> 30:13.991
Turn.

30:14.026 --> 30:15.593
I think there's a tail
or something.

30:15.627 --> 30:17.061
- It's a... yeah.
- Wow.

30:17.095 --> 30:20.398
Massive amount of work.
Massive.

30:21.867 --> 30:24.402
I like the treatment of these
little spots that he added.

30:24.436 --> 30:27.004
Nice little breakup.
Yeah.

30:27.039 --> 30:28.272
Not a big fan of that,

30:28.307 --> 30:31.475
but there are so many
great forms going on.

30:31.510 --> 30:33.010
There's a regality in the Tauren

30:33.045 --> 30:34.912
that he's managed
to get with this.

30:34.947 --> 30:38.349
Can you open all the way,
as if you're screaming at us?

30:38.383 --> 30:40.151
Ahh!

30:40.185 --> 30:42.219
What does this mean?
What does that mean?

30:45.824 --> 30:49.327
This lower jowl form
feels inaccurate.

30:49.361 --> 30:51.562
I'm worried the judges
hate the direction I took.

30:51.597 --> 30:53.230
Looks to me
like she didn't finish this.

30:53.265 --> 30:55.933
It looks like she had spots here
she was gonna give whiskers in.

30:55.968 --> 30:56.968
Yeah.

30:57.002 --> 30:58.669
<i>This is my ideal challenge,</i>

30:58.704 --> 31:01.505
and I feel like
I really blew it.

31:03.008 --> 31:05.176
All right, guys, it's time
to get on Twitter and tell us

31:05.210 --> 31:07.545
who made your favorite
World of Warcraft character

31:07.579 --> 31:09.580
using #FaceOff

31:12.692 --> 31:16.595
This lower jowl form
feels pretty inaccurate.

31:16.630 --> 31:19.398
<i>I know that my Worgen
looks really bad up close.</i>

31:19.432 --> 31:21.133
<i>This is my ideal challenge,</i>

31:21.168 --> 31:24.136
and if I go home on this,
it's just gonna really suck.

31:24.171 --> 31:26.305
I like the profile more than
I do the straight-on.

31:26.339 --> 31:30.409
- Profile's gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

31:30.443 --> 31:33.179
I like this idea that she has
these white stripes here.

31:33.213 --> 31:34.613
It's almost like war paint.

31:34.648 --> 31:37.216
I wonder if she's done
all of the work on the hair,

31:37.250 --> 31:39.418
because that feels a lot
like the game.

31:39.452 --> 31:41.687
Oh, yeah.
It's the favored troll haircut.

31:41.721 --> 31:43.422
It's probably one
of the harder characters

31:43.456 --> 31:44.523
to actually do.

31:51.198 --> 31:52.331
All right, guys.

31:52.365 --> 31:54.266
The judges would like to hear
from each of you

31:54.301 --> 31:56.035
before making their decisions.

31:56.069 --> 31:58.070
Rob, you're up first.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.244
Oh, God.

32:05.278 --> 32:07.246
Hey, Rob. Please tell us
about your character.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.516
My Tauren used to be
a great warrior.

32:10.550 --> 32:12.651
He suffered an injury in battle

32:12.686 --> 32:15.254
and then became the shaman
of his community.

32:15.288 --> 32:17.990
What you're seeing here
is my worst-case scenario.

32:18.024 --> 32:21.894
For a worst-case scenario,
I think it's phenomenal.

32:21.928 --> 32:24.029
Your sculpt is very,
very beautiful.

32:24.064 --> 32:26.098
The proportions of the face
and the shoulders

32:26.132 --> 32:28.200
work extraordinarily well
for me.

32:28.235 --> 32:29.501
Thank you.

32:29.536 --> 32:31.537
I love the treatment
of the mouth especially.

32:31.571 --> 32:34.874
This whole area here
is so well-realized.

32:34.908 --> 32:37.243
It's probably one
of the best muzzled sculptures

32:37.277 --> 32:38.577
I have ever seen on this show.

32:38.612 --> 32:39.812
Thank you.

32:39.846 --> 32:42.615
I would love
to see your best-case scenario,

32:42.649 --> 32:44.049
'cause it's got
to be unbelievable,

32:44.084 --> 32:45.184
'cause this is incredible.

32:45.218 --> 32:46.518
Thank you.

32:46.553 --> 32:48.787
What you've done
with the face is brilliant,

32:48.822 --> 32:50.723
but this is not a Tauren to me.

32:50.757 --> 32:51.991
No.

32:52.025 --> 32:53.792
Even a simple thing
of just adding a nose ring

32:53.827 --> 32:55.361
would have made it more Tauren.

32:55.395 --> 32:58.197
You've obviously got
enormous talent,

32:58.231 --> 33:01.133
but I don't think it's accurate.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.168
Rob, please step back.

33:05.872 --> 33:07.139
- You're a dick.
- I know.

33:07.173 --> 33:09.174
I feel like Simon Cowell.
[chuckles]

33:11.211 --> 33:13.212
Yvonne, you're up.

33:19.252 --> 33:20.819
- Hi, Yvonne.
- Hi.

33:20.854 --> 33:23.289
Please tell us
about your Warcraft goblin.

33:23.323 --> 33:26.191
I decided
to do the female version,

33:26.226 --> 33:30.629
and I wanted to showcase
that they are explosion experts.

33:30.664 --> 33:34.667
She looks like pea soup
from here.

33:34.701 --> 33:37.469
I'm disappointed, because this
was a chance to really go wild

33:37.504 --> 33:39.905
and do something kooky-looking
on this character.

33:39.940 --> 33:43.075
And I think it's a safe,
muddy makeup, honey.

33:43.109 --> 33:44.276
Okay.

33:44.311 --> 33:46.245
You've missed
some opportunities in regard

33:46.279 --> 33:47.479
to proportion,

33:47.514 --> 33:50.416
because the face
doesn't feel goblin-y.

33:50.450 --> 33:55.187
It's just a bit
too synthetic-looking.

33:55.221 --> 33:59.458
It doesn't feel
ugly enough, gritty enough,

33:59.492 --> 34:02.995
or dirty enough to be a goblin.

34:03.029 --> 34:05.965
- Yvonne, please step back.
- Thanks, Krista.

34:11.071 --> 34:13.072
Mel, please come forward.

34:20.380 --> 34:21.780
- Hello, Mel.
- Hello.

34:21.815 --> 34:23.614
Tell us about your troll
character, please.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.684
So I don't know a ton
about them,

34:25.719 --> 34:28.554
but I do know they have
voodoo qualities about them.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.054
Hair is super important.

34:30.090 --> 34:34.226
So I wanted to make sure I was
including that in my decisions.

34:34.260 --> 34:37.563
I think you've succeeded.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.364
Can you turn sideways?

34:39.399 --> 34:40.733
Such a beautiful profile,

34:40.766 --> 34:45.137
and I can see the game character
fully realized here.

34:45.170 --> 34:48.373
It feels so purposeful
and intended.

34:48.408 --> 34:49.808
Thank you.

34:49.842 --> 34:51.877
It's a great depiction
of a troll.

34:51.911 --> 34:53.579
The Mohawk is accurate.

34:53.612 --> 34:54.813
The skin's right.

34:54.848 --> 34:56.715
It's like it stepped
out of the game.

34:56.750 --> 34:57.716
Thank you.

34:57.751 --> 34:59.084
Did you style the hair?

34:59.119 --> 35:00.552
Yeah.
That's all laid hair.

35:00.587 --> 35:02.755
Wow. That's a huge amount
of work.

35:02.789 --> 35:04.423
I know, and I'm really bad
at laying hair.

35:04.457 --> 35:05.557
Not at all. No.

35:05.592 --> 35:07.159
I think that's probably

35:07.193 --> 35:09.294
one of the greatest successes
of your makeup.

35:09.329 --> 35:12.765
It really looks
like it came from that world.

35:12.799 --> 35:14.333
Thank you.

35:14.367 --> 35:15.801
Mel, please step back.

35:15.835 --> 35:17.736
- Thank you.
- Good job.

35:22.108 --> 35:24.810
Walter, please step
to the center.

35:31.818 --> 35:33.218
- Hey, Walter.
- How's it going?

35:33.253 --> 35:34.620
Tell me about your Draenei.

35:34.654 --> 35:35.988
I wanted him to be
a death knight,

35:36.022 --> 35:37.856
so I wanted him
to look kind of scary,

35:37.891 --> 35:39.591
and I wanted to make sure
I followed

35:39.626 --> 35:41.894
some of the important features...

35:41.928 --> 35:44.463
the tentacles, the plates
that come up the head,

35:44.497 --> 35:45.898
and the tail.

35:45.932 --> 35:48.500
What you've done here is beyond

35:48.535 --> 35:53.138
what I would have expected
somebody to be able to do.

35:53.173 --> 35:55.474
The whole thing
is wildly accurate.

35:55.508 --> 35:57.443
The death knight armor,
the Frostmourne,

35:57.477 --> 35:58.811
the coloration of the skin...

35:58.845 --> 36:00.612
you've absolutely nailed it.

36:00.647 --> 36:02.014
Thank you.

36:02.048 --> 36:03.682
The paint job is gorgeous.

36:03.716 --> 36:05.651
The forms
in the face are beautiful,

36:05.685 --> 36:07.086
the shape of the head,
everything.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.154
- Just exquisite.
- Thank you.

36:09.189 --> 36:11.990
This is a very elegant
interpretation

36:12.025 --> 36:14.493
from game into reality.

36:14.527 --> 36:16.428
Simply put, you've nailed it.

36:16.463 --> 36:17.729
Thank you.

36:17.764 --> 36:19.765
Walter, please step back.

36:25.472 --> 36:27.473
Melissa, you're up.

36:30.777 --> 36:33.579
Hello.

36:33.613 --> 36:35.047
- Hi, Melissa.
- Hi.

36:35.081 --> 36:36.582
Tell us about your Worgen
character.

36:36.616 --> 36:38.584
Well, I tried to create
the character

36:38.618 --> 36:40.419
that I would make in the game,

36:40.453 --> 36:42.554
so I made a Worgen druid

36:42.589 --> 36:45.190
that can transform
into a cat to fight

36:45.225 --> 36:47.459
or a bear to take damage.

36:47.494 --> 36:49.628
It feels really rough
technically.

36:49.662 --> 36:51.463
Yes.

36:51.498 --> 36:54.700
As much as you attempted
to give the full package,

36:54.734 --> 36:57.102
the inclusion of feet and hands

36:57.137 --> 36:59.204
caused you to fall down
in a couple of places,

36:59.239 --> 37:02.207
and the ears don't feel
like they're in the right place.

37:02.242 --> 37:04.443
So none of the things
really have the level of detail

37:04.477 --> 37:07.179
that I'm looking for at
this point in the competition.

37:07.213 --> 37:09.481
It looks like you
didn't finish your makeup.

37:09.516 --> 37:11.283
You should have used
more texturing

37:11.317 --> 37:12.684
to give it more life,

37:12.719 --> 37:14.553
and it doesn't look
very realistic.

37:14.587 --> 37:15.821
Yeah.

37:15.855 --> 37:18.257
You have had one of
the hardest jobs here

37:18.291 --> 37:20.025
in making a functional snout.

37:20.059 --> 37:22.027
Obviously, that's the one thing
holding you back,

37:22.061 --> 37:24.229
but I think everything
apart from the snout

37:24.264 --> 37:25.631
is really, really accurate.

37:25.665 --> 37:26.932
Thank you.

37:26.966 --> 37:28.133
Melissa, please step back.

37:28.168 --> 37:30.169
Thank you so much.

37:34.207 --> 37:35.574
All right, guys,
please head back

37:35.608 --> 37:37.476
to the makeup room
while the judges deliberate.

37:37.510 --> 37:39.478
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:44.751 --> 37:46.285
All right, judges,
so why don't we talk

37:46.319 --> 37:48.086
about tonight's looks
and start with your favorites?

37:48.121 --> 37:49.354
What about Rob?

37:49.389 --> 37:50.689
<i>The makeup's almost flawless</i>

37:50.723 --> 37:52.591
<i>in terms
of its technical execution.</i>

37:52.625 --> 37:53.926
<i>The texture on the nose...</i>

37:53.960 --> 37:55.794
<i>I mean, it looked
like a bull's nose.</i>

37:55.828 --> 37:58.130
It was just unbelievably
well done.

37:58.164 --> 37:59.598
He's obviously
very, very skilled.

37:59.632 --> 38:03.302
However, it was a bipedal cow
instead of being a Tauren.

38:03.336 --> 38:05.170
All right, Let's move on to Mel.

38:05.205 --> 38:07.206
<i>I think a lot of Warcraft
fans at home are gonna be</i>

38:07.240 --> 38:08.574
<i>rooting for this one tonight.</i>

38:08.608 --> 38:11.176
<i>There's such a genuine
integrity to the design</i>

38:11.211 --> 38:12.477
<i>and to the source material.</i>

38:12.512 --> 38:15.814
It's a good, classic execution
of a troll.

38:15.848 --> 38:17.916
<i>The profile
was done rather well.</i>

38:17.951 --> 38:20.485
<i>She laid that whole Mohawk
on; That was awesome.</i>

38:20.520 --> 38:22.254
That's probably the best part
of that whole makeup.

38:22.288 --> 38:24.523
All right,
what about Walter's work?

38:24.557 --> 38:27.392
<i>Wow. He accomplished so much
this week.</i>

38:27.427 --> 38:29.094
<i>It was really amazing.</i>

38:29.128 --> 38:31.496
<i>And also a tail
in his spare time.</i>

38:31.531 --> 38:34.533
He obviously had
so much time left over...

38:34.567 --> 38:35.867
Just sitting around.

38:35.902 --> 38:37.369
That he was just like,
"What shall I do now?

38:37.403 --> 38:38.737
Uh, let's make a tail."

38:38.771 --> 38:40.872
And so specifically
making it a death knight.

38:40.907 --> 38:42.474
It could have walked
onto the set of Warcraft,

38:42.508 --> 38:44.309
and you would have believed
that was a Draenei.

38:44.344 --> 38:45.978
All right,
so let's move on to the makeups

38:46.012 --> 38:47.980
that didn't work so well
for you this week.

38:48.014 --> 38:49.815
Let's start with Yvonne.

38:49.849 --> 38:52.050
<i>There was no vibrance;
She just did</i>

38:52.085 --> 38:54.620
<i>a very plasticky-looking
pea green goblin.</i>

38:54.654 --> 38:56.989
<i>And those ears are just
as big and blocky</i>

38:57.023 --> 38:58.790
<i>and as cartoony
as they could possibly be.</i>

38:58.825 --> 39:01.193
It looked
like a cheap Halloween mask.

39:01.227 --> 39:02.294
<i>It was shiny.</i>

39:02.328 --> 39:04.029
<i>The hair wasn't woven in.</i>

39:04.063 --> 39:06.331
It was just a bad job.

39:06.366 --> 39:08.500
All right,
let's move on to Melissa.

39:08.534 --> 39:10.068
<i>Not my favorite.</i>

39:10.103 --> 39:14.206
<i>It falls down because of the
blockiness around the nose,</i>

39:14.240 --> 39:17.109
<i>and the mouth felt
very amateurish.</i>

39:17.143 --> 39:20.379
She couldn't complete
the fingers and the feet

39:20.413 --> 39:21.580
and the face

39:21.614 --> 39:23.749
at a level that allows her
to be in the top.

39:23.783 --> 39:25.317
There were some mistakes
on the face.

39:25.351 --> 39:27.052
<i>I can't argue with any of that.</i>

39:27.086 --> 39:28.320
<i>But as a full package,</i>

39:28.354 --> 39:30.589
<i>I think it was
the most complete character</i>

39:30.623 --> 39:31.657
<i>straight from the game.</i>

39:31.691 --> 39:32.791
All right, then.

39:32.825 --> 39:35.861
Judges, have you chosen
our four semi-finalists?

39:35.895 --> 39:37.029

Mel, although you didn't have
game-specific knowledge,

you nailed the troll aesthetic,

40:01.120 --> 40:02.788

Yvonne, despite capturing
some of the tinkerer spirit

the paint job got muddy,
