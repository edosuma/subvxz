00:16.433 --> 00:17.434
A virus?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.315
So what you're saying is

00:24.399 --> 00:27.569
this entire mess was caused
by a virus you created?

00:32.615 --> 00:34.034
Fine. A virus.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.077
Why? Why did you create the virus?

00:37.495 --> 00:38.455
Detective.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.251
Do you have any children?

01:32.675 --> 01:34.052
Mommy.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.136
Yes, sweetheart.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.891
God, you're soaked in sweat.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.101
Yun-a.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
Oh no. Be careful.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.649
You should watch where you're going.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.067
Good girl.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.569
Could you let your child just die?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.116
No parent in the world could do that.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.202
Enough of your bullshit.
Just answer my question.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.247
What kind of virus is it and--

02:02.330 --> 02:03.998
Jae-ik. Emergency.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
Chief wants everyone to come. Hurry.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.378
It's too late.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.674
Everyone will die.

02:13.716 --> 02:15.218
Don't bother having hope.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.410
Oh fuck.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.655
Cheong-san!

03:17.739 --> 03:19.282
Look down. Down.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.618
I know.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.953
She's holding on, moron.
What are you doing?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
-I know that.
-Drop her. Drop her now.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.916
I'm trying.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.004
What are you doing, you moron?

03:39.093 --> 03:39.969
Hey!

03:42.597 --> 03:44.349
Hey. I'll come to you.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.476
No, don't come.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.229
Don't. Don't come.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.189
-I'm coming.
-Don't!

03:53.191 --> 03:54.484
I said, don't!

04:00.073 --> 04:00.949
Wait.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.826
Bare-su, above you!

04:22.887 --> 04:24.222
Hey. My back.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.641
Stay still. I'll help you.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.144
What are you doing?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.689
Wait, will you? Moron.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.197
-It's Bare-su. Bare-su!
-Cheong-san!

04:46.661 --> 04:48.037
It's Bare-su. Bare-su!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.372
Are you okay?

04:50.915 --> 04:52.959
Shit. I told you to drop her.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.461
Why couldn't you do it?

04:55.545 --> 04:58.298
Hey. Stop hugging me.
You're grossing me out.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.050
I'm not hugging you, moron.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.929
Get lost.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.265
Do you like this?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.979
-Are you okay, Bare-su?
-Close it.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.523
Close it already!

05:16.899 --> 05:18.484
Close the window! Please!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.946
Didn't you see Cheong-san coming in?
We can't close it until he gets in.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.656
Is it wrong to say to close it?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.783
Is your own survival all that matters?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.328
I can't stand you, stupid welfie.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.961
-Hey. What the fuck did you say?
-Stop it.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.171
What is it?

05:38.254 --> 05:40.006
-Did you just hit me?
-Yeah.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.632
Say that again.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.926
Cut it out. What are you doing?

05:44.010 --> 05:45.303
He just hit me.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.096
You called me a welfie first.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.097
Was I wrong?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.974
How could you say that?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.726
What's a welfie?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.478
Tell me.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.188
What is it?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.150
What's a welfie?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.821
A person on welfare.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.116
-What?
-A person on welfare.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.786
"Welfie" for short.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.460
Na-yeon, you were wrong.
Don't you ever say that again.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.753
And, Gyeong-su,

06:18.836 --> 06:21.214
if you hit someone for saying that,
you're the one who loses.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.174
-You understand what I mean, right?
-No.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.344
Kids, we shouldn't be fighting
among ourselves right now.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.970
We don't know what's going on--

06:28.054 --> 06:29.055
Aren't they zombies?

06:29.597 --> 06:33.059
Where are the other teachers?
Did you call the cops?

06:33.142 --> 06:35.103
I'm sure someone did.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.479
I don't have my phone.

06:36.562 --> 06:40.983
We called, too, but they're not coming.
Both the police and the first responders.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.736
They'll be here soon.
Let's wait here a little longer.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.115
Ms. Park. Hyeon-ju's hands were cold too.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.033
So were I-sak's.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.411
What if it started with Hyeon-ju?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.246
She went to the hospital.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.790
Then maybe it spread there too.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.875
Maybe that's why no one's coming.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.045
Hold on. This works, right?

07:01.671 --> 07:03.798
Hey, the Internet.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.133
-Excuse me, Ms. Park.
-Okay.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.884
-Here. Sit.
-Thanks.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.888
-Please, work. I assume so.
-Will it work? Is it on?

07:11.389 --> 07:13.516
Why is it not turning on?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.059
-It just came on.
-I see. Sorry.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.062
It's for work, so it's slow.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.524
Maybe it has no connection.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.817
No, I'm sure it does.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.903
-Do we have to wait all day?
-Is it still loading?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.656
-I don't think it'll work.
-What?

07:28.739 --> 07:30.366
In the science lab.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.121
WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM

07:35.705 --> 07:37.248
I came from the art room.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.042
What's in the science lab?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.587
Oh, well…

07:42.670 --> 07:44.130
It worked.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.341
-Open the browser.
-The browser.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.220
Type in "zombie virus."

07:51.762 --> 07:52.847
Type in "zombie" first.

07:52.930 --> 07:53.764
-No, just…
-No.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.641
-Type in "Hyosan."
-See what's trending.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.018
-No.
-Damn it.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.769
-Check the news.
-Search "emergency."

07:58.853 --> 08:00.229
-The news.
-There won't be anything.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.356
-Search "emergency."
-What do we type in?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.069
Thanks. I'll see you next time.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.213
-Oh my goodness. Are you all right?
-Are you okay? Get up.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.380
Stand up.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.967
-Call an ambulance.
-All right. Come this way.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.929
-What's going on?
-Are you all right?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.639
Are you okay?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.600
He's badly injured. Call an ambulance.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.976
Someone is in the back.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.144
Come out.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.066
What's the matter with you?

08:46.943 --> 08:49.737
-What's wrong with you?
-Should we take them to the hospital?

08:54.325 --> 08:56.160
Oh my God.

09:06.087 --> 09:06.921
Stay away!

09:29.944 --> 09:31.362
I'll check Facebook.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.992
-I'm on Instagram.
-How many followers do you have?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.119
Check Facebook.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.502
How many friends do you have?

09:46.586 --> 09:49.088
You have so many alerts. You have 1,700!

09:50.256 --> 09:51.090
That's strange.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.885
I'll check the messages first.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.930
Fuck! What the…

09:58.764 --> 10:00.391
-What the hell?
-Fuck.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.810
What the hell?

10:02.893 --> 10:03.769
What was that?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.771
Get over here. Step back.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.649
Did someone not make it in?

10:09.483 --> 10:11.110
No. We're all here.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.739
Don't go!

10:14.822 --> 10:15.698
Cheong-san.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.575
Be careful.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.458
Do you see something?

10:27.043 --> 10:27.877
What is it?

10:31.756 --> 10:32.840
It must be the wind.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.800
That scared me.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.141
It's coming in!

10:43.601 --> 10:45.144
Cheong-san, come back here.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.356
Hey, watch out.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.566
Cheong-san!

10:52.109 --> 10:53.569
Bring Cheong-san back here!

10:54.153 --> 10:55.029
Hey, wait!

10:56.822 --> 10:59.241
-Push it! Push it away!
-Did you get it?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.451
Push it!

11:05.456 --> 11:07.166
Push it!

11:07.875 --> 11:08.918
Push it more!

11:11.879 --> 11:12.922
The hand!

11:14.382 --> 11:15.633
-Push!
-Hey, watch out!

11:16.967 --> 11:17.968
Step back!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.137
Step back!

11:32.358 --> 11:33.776
Don't go near it!

11:34.819 --> 11:36.570
-Should I go or should you?
-Move over.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.697
Hold on. I can't.

11:37.780 --> 11:38.948
-Go, Dae-su.
-Should I go?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.828
What are you doing?

12:02.471 --> 12:04.557
-We're fucked.
-Just push it!

12:04.640 --> 12:06.767
Just push it! Push it away!

12:07.935 --> 12:09.145
Push it away already!

12:09.979 --> 12:12.440
-Fuck. It's coming in.
-Su-hyeok! Just throw that away!

12:14.650 --> 12:16.318
-Su-hyeok! Move away!
-Move, Bare-su!

12:31.500 --> 12:32.626
Scared me.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.587
I'm exhausted.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.089
Are you okay?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.007
I'm good.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.552
Where did it come from?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.181
-Everyone okay?
-That was scary.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.223
I'm okay.

12:47.016 --> 12:47.850
Good thinking.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.645
Hey.

12:52.813 --> 12:53.647
You…

12:58.027 --> 12:59.737
RESCUE

12:59.820 --> 13:02.698
HYOSAN CITY COUNCIL

13:05.785 --> 13:07.870
He's our youngest aide.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.581
He collapsed and started convulsing
when he returned

13:10.664 --> 13:11.707
from the council office…

13:11.791 --> 13:12.625
Captain.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.044
He smells like a rotting corpse.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.505
And then he got up,

13:17.588 --> 13:20.132
growled, and charged
at Assembly Member Park.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.218
So we tied him up.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.553
We didn't know
if we should call the police. Yes?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.013
Why are you telling them that?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.307
He'll bite his tongue.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.684
-Let's gag him and move him.
-Okay.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.899
-Ready?
-Yes.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.401
One, two, three.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.740
-Did you get bit?
-It's okay. It's a small bite.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.283
Wrap him up!

13:46.951 --> 13:47.785
Wrap him.

13:52.289 --> 13:55.125
Urgent message from headquarters.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.712
Rescue Team One.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.049
As of now,
issuing level-three disaster in Hyosan.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.176
Everyone report to temporary headquarters.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.928
Did you say level-three disaster?

14:06.637 --> 14:07.805
I repeat.

14:07.888 --> 14:12.309
Issuing level-three disaster in Hyosan.
Everyone report to temporary headquarters.

14:12.893 --> 14:13.727
What is it?

14:13.811 --> 14:15.855
-This is the director's order.
-Report where?

14:15.938 --> 14:17.690
-Mobilize immediately. Over.
-Well…

14:18.357 --> 14:21.569
Our headquarters was relocated
outside the city due to an emergency.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.364
The Disaster and Safety Management
will control the situation directly.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.825
Is an evacuation order really necessary?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.535
All right.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.578
Hang on.

14:32.037 --> 14:35.082
They think it's an acute infection.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.960
They expect an evacuation order
of Hyosan soon.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.548
Gyeong-su, your nose is bleeding.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.717
It is?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.848
This is because Su-hyeok hit me
with the mop.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.641
Stand back. Don't come closer.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.643
You were bit, weren't you?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.270
No, I wasn't.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.855
Su-hyeok hit me…

15:00.983 --> 15:02.902
Why do you keep picking on me?

15:02.985 --> 15:04.486
You were bit!

15:06.196 --> 15:08.198
I-sak got a nosebleed
just before she turned.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.784
On-jo. You know.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.120
That's how I-sak was before she turned.

15:13.203 --> 15:17.082
-Gyeong-su.
-I really wasn't bit! I swear!

15:20.127 --> 15:21.170
Damn it.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.130
Hey.

15:23.213 --> 15:24.965
Your hand. What is that?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.467
What is that?

15:28.969 --> 15:31.180
This was from
when I picked up the computer!

15:34.600 --> 15:35.768
Don't you trust me?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.897
This happened while I was saving you.
How could you do this?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.364
It's not a bite. It's a scratch.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.200
Whoever wants to check, come and check.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.411
It's a scratch?

15:55.454 --> 15:57.831
It is a scratch. I'm sure of it.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.084
-Ms. Park, please take a look.
-Okay.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.797
I don't see a bite.
It's a scratch. Thank goodness.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.881
He's okay.

16:10.719 --> 16:11.553
Satisfied?

16:12.846 --> 16:14.556
I asked if you were satisfied!

16:15.474 --> 16:18.560
But the computer's gone.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.145
Then the Internet…

16:21.438 --> 16:23.315
Did you have to throw that of all things?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.859
What could I do? It was trying to get in.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.571
I'm saying you did good.
Thank you. Don't get mad.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.532
Hey, Na-yeon.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.660
Say you're sorry and end this.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.328
Why should I?

16:36.412 --> 16:38.205
He did it to save us.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.873
Just say you're sorry.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.667
Why should I be sorry?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.502
I saw everything.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.254
I saw it grab your hand.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.425
I'm right.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.844
He may have been infected.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.387
Na-yeon, that's enough.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.055
It really touched him.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.642
Does being touched mean he's infected?

16:58.726 --> 17:00.185
Who knows? It might.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.396
I held I-sak's hand before she fell.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.148
Why am I okay?

17:04.231 --> 17:06.025
He has a wound on his hand.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.485
It's different when it's an open wound.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.987
-Why, that--
-Hey.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.614
Don't yell at me. Think about it!

17:14.366 --> 17:15.242
Na-yeon.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.661
I know you've always hated Gyeong-su,

17:17.745 --> 17:20.539
but this is completely different
from badmouthing him.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.374
This is about life and death.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.168
She's always like this.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.088
If it weren't for him, we may all be dead.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.466
And now he may kill us.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.259
I'm about to die because of you.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.094
-Watch your mouth.
-I'm fine right now.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.597
That's enough, all of you! Shut it.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.765
-Ms. Park--
-Silence.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.932
-She--
-Hey!

17:48.567 --> 17:49.526
Let's do this.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.489
Stay in the recording room
for just ten minutes, Gyeong-su.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.242
I know it'll be hard, but I think
that's better than being suspected.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.579
The others don't suspect me.
It's just her.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.373
Gyeong-su, would you do that, please?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.419
Forget ten minutes. I'll stay half…

18:08.003 --> 18:09.546
No, a full hour.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.841
There's no need for that.
It takes less than five minutes to turn.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.718
-Stop overreacting.
-Let's just be sure.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.471
Will that do?

18:19.056 --> 18:21.433
If nothing happens,
you'll sincerely apologize, right?

18:23.435 --> 18:24.353
Yes.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.232
You guys are all okay with that, right?

18:28.315 --> 18:29.399
-Yes.
-Yes.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.028
He's clearly fine. If we do this,
who would step up next time?

18:33.529 --> 18:34.822
Everyone will hide.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.574
You're right, too, but…

18:40.869 --> 18:44.498
let's consider this a way
to learn to trust each other.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.169
I trust Gyeong-su.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.842
See you in an hour.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.011
Should I go in with you?

19:08.647 --> 19:10.065
That stubborn punk.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.151
Ten minutes would be fine.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.237
He's nothing compared to her.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.509
-Go get it.
-No.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.927
You little…

19:39.011 --> 19:40.179
Stop it.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.263
Go get it.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.852
Move. Stop that.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.380
Hey.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.425
Come here.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.579
Damn it.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.777
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

21:18.860 --> 21:20.195
Maybe they're drawn to smell.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.614
They go after you like crazy.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.533
I don't smell.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.410
You sweat a lot.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.578
I sweat, but I don't smell.

21:29.579 --> 21:30.998
What is that smell?

21:31.832 --> 21:32.791
Your sweat.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.838
I think they're more sensitive
to sound than smell.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.631
-Sound?
-Yes, sound.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.675
This isn't a movie.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.469
That's how most zombies are.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.722
And you saw their eyes.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.890
They can't see with those eyes.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.435
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

21:51.518 --> 21:53.645
Sound or smell, I don't know, but…

21:53.729 --> 21:55.856
Some kids probably left the school, right?

21:56.898 --> 21:57.774
Really?

21:57.858 --> 22:00.235
Yes, probably.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.571
Here, Su-hyeok.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.655
Give me the mirror.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.825
Should we consider ourselves
the lucky ones?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.956
The fact that we're alive

22:14.041 --> 22:15.459
means we're lucky.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.087
Is that true?

22:20.630 --> 22:21.465
Yes.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.300
Wipe your face.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.500
Are you okay?

22:58.001 --> 22:59.419
I keep thinking about I-sak.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.463
But you held onto her

23:02.339 --> 23:04.174
until the very end.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.970
Stop it. That's not comforting.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.681
You did nothing wrong.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.935
Be strong.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.938
Your dad or somebody else

23:19.940 --> 23:21.191
will come to save us.

23:28.824 --> 23:32.536
FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

23:32.619 --> 23:35.122
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

23:35.872 --> 23:37.332
Goodness.

23:37.999 --> 23:41.545
Must you put your son's face on the sign?

23:41.628 --> 23:43.755
What's wrong with using my own son's face?

23:44.506 --> 23:47.092
You'll end up becoming
an evil mother-in-law.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.179
Being all protective of your son while
nagging your daughter-in-law like crazy.

23:55.892 --> 23:56.726
Right.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.147
I'll go submit these
at the District Office.

24:08.905 --> 24:12.159
The series of incidents
occurring in Hyosan

24:12.242 --> 24:16.329
appear to be due to a mass outbreak
of a highly infectious virus.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.833
We'll speak to the Disease Control Center
for more details.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.627
Director Cha Hyeon-seok,
what's the current situation?

24:23.211 --> 24:24.838
Considering the level of spread,

24:24.921 --> 24:27.841
it appears to be
a highly infectious disease.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.886
Those suspected of being infected
became unusually aggressive.

24:30.969 --> 24:36.016
The victims showed similar symptoms,
so we suspect secondary infections.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.060
As you've heard, this is very serious.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.104
On advice from the KDCA,

24:41.188 --> 24:44.316
the government has raised
the infectious disease alert to "serious."

24:44.399 --> 24:46.735
They stated that
they will do everything possible

24:46.818 --> 24:48.987
to prevent it
from spreading outside of Hyosan.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.072
This just in.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.575
The National Security Council has decided

24:53.658 --> 24:57.370
to issue an evacuation
of Hyosan in Gyeonggi.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.332
If you are watching this,

25:00.415 --> 25:03.376
please leave the city immediately.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.004
I repeat. The situation is very serious.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.256
The National Security Council has decided

25:08.340 --> 25:12.344
to issue an evacuation
of Hyosan in Gyeonggi.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.429
If you are watching this,

25:14.513 --> 25:17.557
please leave the city immediately.

25:20.727 --> 25:25.065
-I'm going to step out for a minute.
-Okay.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.402
Are you all right?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.488
Yes, I'm fine.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.156
I'm fine. I…

25:34.574 --> 25:35.450
I…

25:36.201 --> 25:37.118
I'll be back soon.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.707
A virus?

25:43.500 --> 25:44.668
What type of virus?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.255
I don't think it's a droplet infection,
but it hasn't been confirmed.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.424
You seem to get infected if you get bit,

25:51.508 --> 25:53.969
so don't get bit or make physical contact.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.888
We don't have
any information on the virus yet,

25:57.389 --> 26:00.225
so make sure to avoid contact.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.187
I hear an assembly member is there.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.897
-Hold still.
-Who is it?

26:09.276 --> 26:10.193
Yeong-hwan.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.947
What the…

26:16.741 --> 26:18.577
Yeong-hwan, are you okay?

26:20.203 --> 26:21.621
Hey. Captain, what do we do?

26:22.956 --> 26:24.040
Yeong-hwan!

26:25.667 --> 26:26.668
Hey.

26:26.751 --> 26:30.422
That's what happened to our aide earlier.

26:32.007 --> 26:32.924
It's the same.

26:35.719 --> 26:36.636
Shit.

26:38.888 --> 26:39.973
Is he dead?

26:47.147 --> 26:48.189
Hey!

26:55.655 --> 26:56.489
U-sin!

26:57.240 --> 26:58.283
Get the rope!

26:59.200 --> 27:00.952
-Hurry!
-Tie him up!

27:04.205 --> 27:06.625
Tie him up! Hurry!

27:08.168 --> 27:11.129
We've got approximately 200 infected
at Hyosan Intersection.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.757
Unit 1030, 1040, 1050.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.384
Move to Hyosan Intersection.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.429
Copy that. This is Unit 1030.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.389
We're heading to Hyosan Intersection.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.141
Brace for impact!

28:15.568 --> 28:18.154
Go join the line!

28:24.577 --> 28:26.037
Block them!

28:30.375 --> 28:31.418
Stand firm!

28:35.797 --> 28:37.257
Join the line!

28:39.259 --> 28:40.510
Wait. Hey!

28:43.722 --> 28:45.807
Stop! Stop right there.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.435
-Go back.
-I'll be quick.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.519
What are you doing?

28:50.061 --> 28:51.688
She wants to get through.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.356
You need to go.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.483
-My son--
-You need to evacuate.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.569
-Get her out of here.
-Yes, sir.

28:57.652 --> 29:00.113
-No. Wait.
-Escort her out of here.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.657
My son, Cheong-san. Wait!

29:32.979 --> 29:35.064
I'm sorry.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.610
Do you go to Hyosan High?
What are you doing here?

29:39.819 --> 29:40.945
Is the school okay?

29:41.446 --> 29:43.448
Hey. Do you know Cheong-san?

29:44.115 --> 29:45.909
Lee Cheong-san? Do you know him?

29:55.668 --> 29:56.544
Oh no.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.722
Hey. Lift me more.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.224
That's the highest I can go.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.142
Get on your tippy-toes.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.685
I did.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.479
Do you see anything?

30:15.522 --> 30:18.566
Shit. There are so many zombies.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.236
-Put me down.
-Okay.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.238
Let me down. Careful.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.239
Okay.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.242
Why is this so hard?
-Are you okay?

30:27.325 --> 30:28.952
-That hurts.
-Yes.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.122
What do we do?

30:34.332 --> 30:35.416
First.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.460
Do you have cigarettes?

30:38.044 --> 30:38.878
I don't smoke.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.464
Damn, you totally look like a smoker.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.424
Hey, what about you?

30:44.342 --> 30:46.553
-I don't smoke.
-Don't mess with me.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.012
I don't.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.558
Is that how you talk to a senior?
Want to die?

30:52.559 --> 30:54.769
Whatever. Look who's talking.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.147
Hey. Who taught you
to talk like that to a senior?

31:05.530 --> 31:06.698
-Sorry.
-Hey.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.409
I'm the one you should apologize to.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.538
Athletes are all douchebags. Fuck.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.790
Watch your mouth.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.916
Watch your body.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.544
Must you guys fight right now?

31:19.627 --> 31:21.546
Don't you have brains? Are you babies?

31:24.382 --> 31:25.216
Sorry.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.135
I said I was sorry.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.595
Let's get out of here.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.305
How can we leave?

31:30.388 --> 31:32.557
They'll eat us all if they see us.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.352
If you want to leave, go by yourself.
I'm not going.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.980
-What about you?
-Don't ask.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.565
I'll do whatever I feel like.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.735
Damn. What a cold bitch.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.572
Hey. Make some weapons.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.741
Come on.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.493
Give me that.

32:20.563 --> 32:21.481
Moron.

32:22.732 --> 32:23.650
Hey.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.402
I'll kill you.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.543
That moron.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.004
What is that?

32:48.049 --> 32:48.925
Thirty minutes.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.013
-What are you saying?
-It's been 30 minutes. Come out.

33:06.693 --> 33:10.196
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but Gyeong-su won't come out.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.865
Okay. I'll bring him out.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.536
What's wrong with him?

33:20.498 --> 33:21.582
He's fine.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.002
-He's totally fine.
-I knew it.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.881
-Why is he being so stubborn?
-He won't come out, right?

33:32.468 --> 33:34.262
He's so pigheaded.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.555
He's so stubborn.

33:38.016 --> 33:38.850
What?

33:42.103 --> 33:43.187
What did he say?

33:43.271 --> 33:44.188
He won't come out?

33:45.106 --> 33:47.191
He says he'll stay the full hour.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.693
He's sulking.

33:49.652 --> 33:50.570
I'll go in.

33:50.653 --> 33:51.738
Why should you?

33:52.780 --> 33:54.824
If anyone should go in, it's Na-yeon.

33:58.786 --> 33:59.704
Why should I?

33:59.787 --> 34:01.831
He's like that because of you.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.042
-What did I do?
-Like you don't know?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.460
Was it wrong to suspect him?

34:06.044 --> 34:08.379
You did too. Every last one of you.

34:10.381 --> 34:11.841
I didn't suspect him.

34:11.924 --> 34:12.759
Me neither.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.261
I did. She's right.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.139
But I didn't look down on him
like you did.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.267
-Why are you picking on me?
-You're the only one acting that way.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.685
That's enough, Ji-min.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.988
You remember your promise, right?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.157
That you'd apologize after 30 minutes.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.576
Yes.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.415
It's been 30 minutes.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.002
Fine.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.882
She's going to him.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.556
Hey.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.684
I'm talking to you.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.063
Are you ignoring me?

35:51.732 --> 35:55.570
-Are you starting a fight again?
-They're talking. It's looking good.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.198
-Why didn't you answer?
-Unless you're here to apologize, get out.

35:59.782 --> 36:00.867
How's your cut?

36:00.950 --> 36:01.993
What's it to you?

36:03.327 --> 36:04.162
Let me see.

36:06.747 --> 36:09.375
She grabbed his hand. Oh my God.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.670
Talk about being forward.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.429
I suspected you

36:22.221 --> 36:24.056
because the situation called for it.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.143
And I was really mad earlier.

36:29.770 --> 36:30.938
I'm still mad now.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.608
I guess that's…

36:34.400 --> 36:36.027
Does Gyeong-su like that stuff?

36:37.195 --> 36:38.613
I have no idea.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.783
You know I've always
looked down on you, right?

36:46.120 --> 36:48.956
It's fine. It's all in the past. Let's go.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.583
What's fine?

36:51.459 --> 36:53.169
You deserve to be looked down on.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.714
Our complex banned you welfies,
but you still cut through.

36:57.548 --> 36:58.966
And you dare push me?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.801
You fucking…

37:00.885 --> 37:02.136
You thought I'd apologize?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.388
They're going to kiss.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.099
They must be crazy.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.227
Everyone's taking your side.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.813
I was cornered
because of a nobody like you.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.191
Stay the full hour.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.569
Although I hope you never come out.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.573
Damn welfie.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.075
They're coming.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.161
-Hey!
-How nice was that? How nice--

37:27.662 --> 37:29.330
-Gyeong-su!
-You little--

37:29.413 --> 37:31.207
-What's wrong?
-Gyeong-su, what's wrong?

37:31.290 --> 37:33.668
You're really a fucking…

37:34.669 --> 37:36.045
Seriously…

37:41.884 --> 37:44.637
-Why must I always take it?
-Did you really say that?

37:44.720 --> 37:46.722
You promised me.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.849
I did nothing wrong.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.102
You only think about yourself.

37:51.727 --> 37:53.521
You said not to let our friends in.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.690
You said to close the door
before they came in.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.857
That's not right.

37:58.276 --> 38:01.070
We almost died
because Gyeong-su pulled Mr. Kang in.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.989
But you don't say a word about that?

38:03.656 --> 38:07.159
He didn't pull him in.
He didn't know that would happen.

38:07.243 --> 38:10.246
-That's enough. Quiet, everyone.
-We'd be quiet if she was gone.

38:11.789 --> 38:12.832
Whatever.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.834
All of you are so annoying.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.004
What if I'm right?

38:19.171 --> 38:21.215
Then will you admit I saved you?

38:21.882 --> 38:25.177
How could you still be this way?

38:31.058 --> 38:31.976
Look.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.438
See if I'm right or wrong.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.363
What?

38:51.120 --> 38:51.954
Gyeong-su.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.924
Day 26 of infection.

39:05.718 --> 39:08.137
See? You still think I'm wrong?

39:09.055 --> 39:11.932
The strong cells are attacking
the weak cells.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.728
Every single cell
is struggling to survive…

39:17.730 --> 39:19.315
and attacking each other.

39:19.398 --> 39:22.276
This virus is the will to survive defined.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.738
It consumes all the cells
almost instantly.

39:32.119 --> 39:34.789
Hey. What's wrong with me?
Something's wrong with me.

39:37.041 --> 39:37.917
What the fuck.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.044
What's wrong with you?

39:42.129 --> 39:43.047
It's not true.

39:44.965 --> 39:47.176
Get rid of him. Get rid of him now!

39:47.259 --> 39:49.470
-No, I--
-Stop it, Gyeong-su.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.390
Don't do that.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.810
Fuck, I'm not!

39:57.103 --> 39:58.354
I'm sorry, Gyeong-su.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.773
Still, don't do it.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.699
I've turned, right?

40:12.284 --> 40:13.619
Cheong-san, what do I do?

40:18.040 --> 40:23.212
No. No, it can't be. Why would you…

40:23.295 --> 40:24.171
Cheong-san.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.131
Let go.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.300
Moron. It's not true.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.636
Why would you suddenly…

40:31.887 --> 40:34.348
The infected human feels extreme fear…

40:38.227 --> 40:40.438
Then they attack only to survive.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.942
Hey. You weren't bit.

40:45.025 --> 40:46.944
Stay away. Don't come any closer! Fuck!

40:55.536 --> 40:57.621
What are you doing? Tell him to get out.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.374
We're all going to die!

41:00.458 --> 41:01.459
Why…

41:02.501 --> 41:05.254
Fuck, why am I…

41:05.337 --> 41:06.464
Fuck.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.013
Get out. I said to get out!

41:14.096 --> 41:16.348
Shut up! Fuck!

41:16.432 --> 41:17.850
I'll leave.

41:18.434 --> 41:21.020
I'll leave on my own.

41:22.229 --> 41:26.817
Why would I bite you?
We're fucking friends.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.280
If I leave, it'll all be fine.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.285
Gyeong-su,

41:37.036 --> 41:39.163
why don't you just go back
into the recording--

41:39.246 --> 41:40.915
What will you do if we all die?

41:40.998 --> 41:41.916
Na-yeon!

41:41.999 --> 41:43.542
We have to live.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.007
I'll leave.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.774
I'll get out of here on my own.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.612
Sorry, I'll get out of here.

42:14.323 --> 42:15.449
Gyeong-su.

42:16.158 --> 42:18.577
It's okay.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.622
Thank you, guys, for everything.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.207
Really.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.292
Stay alive.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.802
Are you all right, Gyeong-su?

42:36.095 --> 42:37.388
That moron.

42:39.932 --> 42:40.975
What are you looking at?

42:41.976 --> 42:45.938
Why are you doing that?
You're scaring me. Stop that.

42:47.147 --> 42:50.109
Stop it.
Cheong-san, why are you doing that?

42:50.859 --> 42:53.028
Stop it! Stop it, please! I'm scared!

43:24.143 --> 43:25.019
Oh no!

45:35.399 --> 45:40.028
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

45:42.573 --> 45:44.575
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BEGINNING

46:52.684 --> 46:53.685
-Here. Lift it.
-Okay.

46:53.769 --> 46:54.770
Here.

46:56.104 --> 46:57.022
Lift it.

47:04.571 --> 47:07.991
The Disaster and Safety Management said
not to touch the infected.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.870
As you can see, it's highly contagious--

47:11.954 --> 47:14.623
We were notified too.
No need to explain it to us.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.460
How long will we stay here?

47:18.544 --> 47:21.046
They're sending a helicopter,
but it's taking some time.

47:21.129 --> 47:23.006
So you'll have to wait a while longer.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.010
Did you notify them that I'm here?

47:27.094 --> 47:27.970
Pardon?

47:29.888 --> 47:33.433
Is it taking time to get a chopper
even though they know I'm here?

47:33.517 --> 47:35.060
I didn't report that you were here.

47:36.436 --> 47:38.188
You should've told them

47:38.272 --> 47:40.023
so they'd send one quickly.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.612
As per the rules of rescue,
the weak and critically ill

47:45.696 --> 47:47.573
take priority over people of status.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.618
We'll hear from them soon,
so please wait a little longer.

47:59.585 --> 48:00.878
ON-JO'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

48:00.961 --> 48:02.588
Is the helicopter even coming?

48:02.671 --> 48:05.299
Yes, I'm sure it will.
Why don't we rest for now?

48:08.218 --> 48:11.305
The person you have called is unavailable.

48:15.225 --> 48:17.269
This is Capt. Nam So-ju
of Rescue Team One.

48:17.811 --> 48:20.147
If anyone knows the situation
at Hyosan High School,

48:20.689 --> 48:21.773
please respond. Over.

48:29.114 --> 48:32.326
If anyone knows of the situation
at Hyosan High School or its vicinity,

48:33.076 --> 48:34.202
please respond. Over.

48:43.128 --> 48:44.296
Please respond.

48:45.380 --> 48:47.257
RESCUE

48:57.976 --> 48:59.102
Gyeong-su, that punk.

49:00.562 --> 49:01.855
He was such a good kid.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.483
Why did he have to turn?

49:07.736 --> 49:08.987
I told you

49:09.863 --> 49:10.989
he was infected.

49:11.698 --> 49:13.909
Are you happy?

49:14.910 --> 49:17.079
You were all wrong. Only I was right.

49:18.288 --> 49:19.623
What if you didn't have me?

49:20.916 --> 49:21.750
Hey.

49:26.004 --> 49:26.922
Maybe you did it.

49:27.005 --> 49:27.965
What?

49:36.848 --> 49:38.141
I saw…

49:40.143 --> 49:41.228
what you did.

49:44.189 --> 49:46.024
What? What did you see?

49:46.108 --> 49:47.275
You did it.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.152
I didn't do it.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.737
I didn't do that to Gyeong-su.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.823
I didn't mention him.

49:54.116 --> 49:55.075
Stop that.

49:55.575 --> 49:56.785
What do you mean?

49:57.786 --> 49:58.829
I didn't do it.

49:58.912 --> 50:02.165
While we were all looking at him,
you were in the back alone.

50:02.749 --> 50:06.336
Ms. Park. It's been more than 30 minutes,
but Gyeong-su won't come out.

50:09.464 --> 50:11.800
Okay. I'll bring him out.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.262
What's wrong with him?

50:20.267 --> 50:21.101
He's fine.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.728
-He's totally fine.
-I knew it.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.230
He should just come out.

50:26.481 --> 50:28.233
He's still not coming out?

50:28.316 --> 50:29.651
I guess not.

50:29.735 --> 50:31.903
Hasn't he been in there long enough?

50:35.407 --> 50:37.659
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.331
No, I didn't.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.459
You rubbed that
on Gyeong-su's wound, right?

50:46.293 --> 50:48.670
-I didn't.
-Your handkerchief is in your pocket.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.213
-And if it is?
-Take it out.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.049
-No.
-Take it out.

50:52.132 --> 50:53.550
I said, no.

50:54.301 --> 50:55.260
Should I take it out?

50:56.136 --> 50:57.387
Damn it.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.806
Who the hell do you think you are?

50:59.890 --> 51:01.683
Is classroom president special?

51:02.642 --> 51:05.604
Since when did you consider me
your classroom president?

51:05.687 --> 51:07.230
Nam-ra, that's enough.

51:10.233 --> 51:12.611
Nam-ra, do you realize what you're saying?

51:12.694 --> 51:14.237
If that's true,

51:15.363 --> 51:17.741
it means Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

51:18.325 --> 51:19.201
It's true.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.204
Na-yeon…

51:24.498 --> 51:25.624
killed Gyeong-su.

51:27.250 --> 51:28.335
You fucking bitch.

51:29.795 --> 51:30.670
There you go.

51:31.296 --> 51:32.214
Satisfied?

51:37.803 --> 51:38.762
There's blood on it.

51:38.845 --> 51:40.722
I wiped Gyeong-su's wound.

51:41.890 --> 51:43.100
This is Gyeong-su's blood?

51:43.183 --> 51:44.184
Can't you tell?

51:45.644 --> 51:47.395
Then put it on your wound.

51:50.982 --> 51:53.026
Wipe your wound with it if you're so sure.

51:54.152 --> 51:55.445
Like his blood is clean?

51:56.530 --> 51:57.656
He became a zombie.

51:59.533 --> 52:03.245
He was fine until you rubbed him
with your handkerchief.

52:04.037 --> 52:04.996
Na-yeon, you--

52:05.080 --> 52:06.456
Fuck! It wasn't me!

52:12.796 --> 52:14.214
Don't do it. Stop it.

52:14.297 --> 52:15.423
Let go.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.217
I said to stop it.

52:17.843 --> 52:18.885
Give it to me.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.846
Leave me alone! Fuck!

52:22.722 --> 52:24.850
I'll just die too, then.

52:24.933 --> 52:26.518
That's what you want, isn't it?

52:32.983 --> 52:34.818
What makes Gyeong-su better than me?

52:37.737 --> 52:39.948
That dirty welfie pushed me.

52:43.493 --> 52:45.203
Na-yeon, you didn't…

52:45.287 --> 52:47.455
Hey. Did you do it?

52:47.539 --> 52:49.624
-Calm down.
-How could you--

52:49.708 --> 52:51.418
I didn't kill him!

52:52.836 --> 52:54.921
Gyeong-su fell, but he got up and ran.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.048
He's still alive.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.134
He didn't die. He turned.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.468
Are you kidding me?

53:00.552 --> 53:02.429
Why are you all picking on me?

53:03.930 --> 53:06.474
You all laughed when I said he smelled.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.810
You all badmouthed him too.

53:08.894 --> 53:10.520
Why are you acting innocent now?

53:10.604 --> 53:12.647
-That little…
-Cheong-san.

53:13.315 --> 53:14.608
Why did you kill him?

53:14.691 --> 53:15.567
Stop it.

53:23.950 --> 53:24.868
You're…

53:28.121 --> 53:29.164
a murderer.

53:52.896 --> 53:53.730
I…

53:54.773 --> 53:56.900
I have no friends.

54:00.111 --> 54:01.696
I don't need any of you.

54:03.198 --> 54:04.199
Fuck this.

54:15.919 --> 54:17.045
Hey!

54:33.019 --> 54:33.895
Guys.

54:37.857 --> 54:40.151
No matter what happens, don't die.

54:41.820 --> 54:43.697
And don't let anyone else die.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.501
If you cause someone else to die,

54:58.003 --> 54:59.963
living becomes meaningless.

55:02.799 --> 55:03.675
Okay?

55:22.110 --> 55:23.820
Ms. Park!

55:24.529 --> 55:25.780
Dae-su, don't go.

55:27.073 --> 55:28.700
She left.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.605
Fuck!

1:00:04.142 --> 1:00:07.145
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:10.064
