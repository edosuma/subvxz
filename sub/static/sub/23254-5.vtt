00:21.840 --> 00:23.760
How are you feeling

00:27.200 --> 00:28.040
Good.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.640
What're you two doing today, then?

00:30.920 --> 00:32.280
Can we go feed the ducks?

00:32.360 --> 00:34.960
-Ah, ducks! Sounds good.
-No, James. I said,

00:35.600 --> 00:36.880
not today.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.800
Come on. You can manage ducks, can't you?

00:40.880 --> 00:42.400
Be good for you to get out.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.040
Please?

00:49.200 --> 00:50.320
OK.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.160
Ducks.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.400
Hey, I want to tell you something.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.720
I love you.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.640
I need to feed them.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.600
Thanks for coming in, son.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.080
Son?

02:54.480 --> 02:55.480
Hello?

02:58.680 --> 02:59.560
Yeah?

03:01.200 --> 03:03.000
Sorry about the wait.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.880
I'm DC Onslow.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.200
They, um...

03:07.360 --> 03:08.760
They told me you've, uh...

03:09.600 --> 03:13.040
you've come in
to report a murder, is that right?

03:14.160 --> 03:17.880
<i> In the cold light of day,</i>
<i>that suddenly didn't seem right at all.</i>

03:18.120 --> 03:18.960
Uh-huh.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.160
OK, so, um...

03:23.120 --> 03:25.520
-I'm gonna need you to come with me.
-It was my mum.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.560
-Yeah, you just need to wait.
-She killed herself.

03:32.920 --> 03:33.880
Right.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.200
OK.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
Um...

03:41.720 --> 03:44.280
So, um, do you want to tell me what...

03:46.520 --> 03:48.560
what happened?
Did you find the body

03:48.640 --> 03:50.520
I was there when she did it.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.400
Right.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.920
Well, um...

03:59.160 --> 04:01.280
And so, when did this...

04:02.160 --> 04:03.000
when did this happen?

04:03.080 --> 04:04.440
-11 years ago.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
OK.

04:16.080 --> 04:16.960
Um...

04:19.960 --> 04:22.120
So, here's the thing. Um...

04:22.800 --> 04:25.440
It's not technically a murder.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.880
Suicide, it's a whole,
different wheelhouse, really, um.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.400
I mean, suicide's not even a crime...

04:34.480 --> 04:35.880
...which is... mad, innit?

04:39.120 --> 04:40.520
Do you want to speak to a woman?

04:42.040 --> 04:43.800
Why would I want to speak to a woman?

04:45.840 --> 04:48.520
Well, you know, because,
you know...

04:50.520 --> 04:51.360
No. What about your dad?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.080
Have you got a dad?

04:57.680 --> 04:58.880
No, not really.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.440
Can we come in?

05:03.520 --> 05:05.400
God, is it James?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.000
Is he dead?

05:08.320 --> 05:10.360
Your son stole your car...

05:11.240 --> 05:14.320
then crashed it into a tree
and set fire to it.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.800
It was found last night.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.280
Has he ever done anything
like that before?

05:23.600 --> 05:26.720
Why didn't you say anything about the car
when you reported him missing?

05:27.640 --> 05:29.840
Well, I didn't want him
to get into trouble.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.760
He's a weird kid, but he's not bad.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.320
Uh, who did that to you?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.320
I just got into a fight.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.680
At the pub.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.560
Did James do it?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.840
No.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.520
Is his mum around?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.440
No.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.640
Is she at work?

05:51.600 --> 05:52.880
She's dead.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.720
Sorry.

05:59.280 --> 06:00.640
Really sorry.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.120
Does anyone want a cup of tea?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.200
Kettle's on.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.520
Did you find his girlfriend, then?

06:17.600 --> 06:20.480
-She's called Alyssa.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.600
<i> It was the right thing,</i>
<i>to leave James...</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:48.600
<i>I didn't kill anyone.</i>

06:50.520 --> 06:53.120
<i>It's better if I go to my dad's</i>
<i>on my own, anyway.</i>

06:54.840 --> 06:57.360
<i>I wish I hadn't left James</i>
<i>with the money, though.</i>

07:00.800 --> 07:02.000
<i>Oh, God.</i>

07:03.120 --> 07:04.640
<i>I'd really like it if this was</i>

07:04.720 --> 07:07.600
<i>some horrendous,</i>
<i>murder-inspired fantasy moment.</i>

07:08.400 --> 07:09.600
<i>But no.</i>

07:10.760 --> 07:11.920
What's she done?

07:13.520 --> 07:14.560
Is she OK?

07:14.640 --> 07:15.920
When did you last see Alyssa?

07:16.880 --> 07:18.080
On Saturday.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.680
We were having a party,
and she ran away.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.160
Why?

07:22.680 --> 07:24.560
Didn't like handing out the canapés.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
What time did she leave?

07:27.560 --> 07:28.520
It was around...

07:28.600 --> 07:32.000
I'm sorry. Could you let
your wife answer, please?

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
Sure.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.160
I mean, it's not my daughter,
not my problem.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.520
Do you know where she is now?
Has she rung at all?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.360
I don't know where she is.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.840
Look, what is this about?

07:54.920 --> 07:57.320
We need to talk to your daughter
in connection with a murder.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.040
Oh, my God.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.160
-She's not a suspect.
-Not at the moment.

08:01.240 --> 08:02.840
Jesus Christ!

08:03.960 --> 08:05.840
She's a potential witness.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.320
Didn't you think
to report her as missing?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.640
Her boyfriend's dad
reported him immediately.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.080
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

08:15.840 --> 08:19.760
We're going to need
a recent photograph of Alyssa. Um...

08:22.960 --> 08:24.080
Do you have one?

08:26.200 --> 08:28.040
I've got some upstairs.

08:35.559 --> 08:39.480
I can recommend
Childline or the NSPCC.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.040
OK, will do.

08:47.480 --> 08:48.480
Thanks.

08:52.960 --> 08:58.120
So, I've been speaking to my DI,
that was him on the phone there.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.320
What we thought would be
the best thing is if we put you

09:01.400 --> 09:03.240
in touch with social services.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.560
And they can take things from here.
What do you think?

09:09.080 --> 09:11.600
Unless you've got someone else
who can look after you?

09:16.320 --> 09:19.000
OK, so that's what I'm going to do, then.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.280
So...

09:26.640 --> 09:31.480
So, I'm gonna need a few
details from you, young man.

09:32.600 --> 09:35.560
So, first up... This is typical.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.240
Who do you have to fuck around here
to get a pen that works?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.160
Here we go.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.600
Uh, full name.

09:50.480 --> 09:51.880

No wonder she ran away.
Poor kid.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.480
Let's just wait and see.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.680
Are you sure?

11:30.800 --> 11:32.040
I'm on a fast day.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.840
Thought you were tense.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.760
Can I say something?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
Yeah.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.560
I think we should clear the air.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.440
Wait, just hear me out.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.600
Uh, I think it's more professional.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.720
Look...

11:55.360 --> 11:57.240
people get drunk and...

11:58.440 --> 12:02.400
stuff happens in the night that maybe
wouldn't happen in the day.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.560
And just because that comes
as a surprise,

12:04.640 --> 12:08.280
it doesn't necessarily mean
it's a bad thing.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.160
I can see you regret it.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.240
I don't regret it.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.800
I just wish it hadn't happened.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.400
-Alyssa.
-I don't want to hold your hand.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.080
Did you take anything else?

13:14.160 --> 13:15.040
Arms out.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.440
-Arms out.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.720
-Don't fucking touch me.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.240
All right.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.560
How did you get that?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.160
Are you going to look at me?

13:44.880 --> 13:45.880
Hmm?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.800
-I don't want to have sex with you.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.720
I don't want to,
even if you pay me.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.400
I don't want to have sex with you!

14:00.080 --> 14:02.360
I have sex with my wife.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.920
<i> Shit.</i>

14:11.840 --> 14:13.160
What's going to happen to me?

14:13.680 --> 14:16.800
I'm going to file a report.
And then I'm going to call the police.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.240
-Yes.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.680
You're a thief.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.760
<i> Not the police.</i>

14:21.840 --> 14:23.640
<i> Emil? A bloke's lost his kid.</i>

14:23.720 --> 14:25.200
<i>Little girl</i>

14:26.920 --> 14:29.040
I'm just handling something,
can you deal with it?

14:29.200 --> 14:30.480
<i> It's the end of my shift.</i>

14:35.680 --> 14:36.880
All right, I'm coming.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.800
Stay here.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.800
Fucking idiot.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.120
She is five, but she's really tiny,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.240
and she's got brown hair
down to about here.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.520
No, I was just...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.160
...gray leggings and a...

15:35.880 --> 15:38.280
-Daddy!

15:39.760 --> 15:40.600
Thank you.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.400
Thank you. Thank you so much!

15:44.960 --> 15:46.360
Don't do that again.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.800
<i> I knew</i>
<i>she was probably long gone...</i> <i>but it seemed important to try.</i>

16:03.800 --> 16:06.360

16:08.000 --> 16:09.400

16:20.240 --> 16:21.120
Are you OK?

16:22.560 --> 16:23.720
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.800
Got a boyfriend?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.000
Did he hurt you?

16:41.760 --> 16:42.880
Did he do that?

16:43.880 --> 16:45.760
No, someone else.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.880
Go on, get out of here.

16:58.840 --> 16:59.680
Really?

17:01.280 --> 17:02.240
Yeah.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.120
What about the pants?
