00:01.268 --> 00:03.769
(liquid pours)

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
(clink)

02:10.531 --> 02:13.198
(door shutting)

02:40.094 --> 02:40.993
- Hello?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.262
Is anyone here?

02:48.102 --> 02:49.568
- Good evening.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.271
I wasn't expecting
anymore customers tonight.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.139
In fact, I was about
ready to close up

02:54.141 --> 02:55.741
the shop for the weekend.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.376
- I'm sorry, I know
it's really last minute

02:57.378 --> 02:59.178
with tomorrow being
Christmas Eve and all,

02:59.180 --> 03:02.447
but I was hoping to find
a present for my sister.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.649
- Your sister?

03:04.652 --> 03:05.517
I see.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.989
And her interests run more
toward the unusual, I presume?

03:10.991 --> 03:13.258
- Yeah, to say the least.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.460
She's always been the
strange one in the family.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.828
But Christmas got
away from me this year

03:16.830 --> 03:18.497
and so I was looking
for some local shops

03:18.499 --> 03:20.465
that might have something
that she would like

03:20.467 --> 03:22.968
and I came up with you.

03:22.970 --> 03:28.040
- (sighs) Well, I would be
happy to help you but, uh,

03:29.910 --> 03:32.077
it is quite late.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.880
- It's just, you're
my last hope.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.916
We do our gift
exchange tomorrow night

03:37.918 --> 03:40.586
and I have to find
her something perfect.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.087
Will you help me?

03:45.659 --> 03:47.859
- You know, most of the people
that come into this shop,

03:47.861 --> 03:50.996
they like to look around,
they ask questions,

03:50.998 --> 03:55.067
but they don't particularly
like to spend money.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.336
So.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.740
- I am not one of those people.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.009
- Oh, clearly you're not.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.078
(sighs)

04:07.982 --> 04:10.616
Well, (sighs).

04:12.853 --> 04:14.186
All right, fine.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.688
I'll be happy to help you.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.759
So, question is what suits
your sister's tastes?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.529
Because I have many
things in here.

04:24.531 --> 04:29.268
Human skulls, Ouija boards,
coffins, caskets, taxidermy,

04:30.237 --> 04:32.804
and many other singular items.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.409
And I have to tell
you that everything,

04:37.411 --> 04:42.481
all of the objects in this
shop, have a story behind them.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.752
If they don't have a story,
I will not sell them.

04:46.754 --> 04:50.656
Which is why I call
my shop Never Told.

04:50.658 --> 04:55.727
All the objects in here have a
story that's never been told.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.096
So, have a look around.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.604
(gentle holiday music)

05:12.513 --> 05:15.580
- What's the story
with that mask?

05:15.582 --> 05:18.650
- Oh, the mask, you
have a good eye.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.088
This mask was
retrieved in the ashes

05:23.090 --> 05:25.157
of a fire, a house fire.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.092
- Did anyone die?

05:27.094 --> 05:29.361
- Oh, yes, several people.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.930
And not all from the fire.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.298
- What do you mean?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.934
- Well, this mask belonged to a

05:38.172 --> 05:41.006
very strange little girl.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.309
And all the kids
would make fun of her.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.245
They called her Doll-face.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.351
(dramatic music)

06:02.029 --> 06:06.998
(car engine rumbling)
(crunching)

06:07.000 --> 06:09.568
(tense music)

06:27.421 --> 06:28.754
- Jesus.

06:28.756 --> 06:29.688
I thought we were
gonna do something

06:29.690 --> 06:32.124
romantic for Valentine's Day.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.764
- Here we are, girls.

06:40.567 --> 06:45.303
They call it The Inferno
'cause things get a little hot.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.975
- Shut up, Jon, God,
you're so stupid.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.443
- Come on, girl, Chyna and Julie

06:51.445 --> 06:53.912
already know I'm gonna heat
up your panties tonight.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.380
- Asshole!

06:55.382 --> 06:58.917
- Come on, Mira, I'm
just playing, girl.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.986
- No, it's the 320 exit.

07:02.256 --> 07:06.391
Yeah, you'll see Jon's
stupid gas guzzler out front.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.432
Some place, huh?

07:17.271 --> 07:19.337
- Oh my God, you are so right.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.872
That mascara totally
gave me the confidence

07:20.874 --> 07:22.374
I needed to tell
him it was over.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.709
- I told you, babe, you've
just gotta get those lashes

07:24.711 --> 07:27.746
plumped and you feel like
the baddest bitch in town.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.448
- And he was texting me like,

07:29.450 --> 07:31.149
"Babe, you can't
treat me like this,"

07:31.151 --> 07:33.251
cry face, cry face, cry face.

07:33.253 --> 07:37.489
I was like, "You have to treat
a queen with respect," crown.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.957
I'm just so glad I
talked to you first.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.394
- Oh my God, I'm so glad
I talked to you too.

07:42.396 --> 07:43.862
- You have just got
to meet my sister.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.933
She's really pretty, you
would totally love her.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.585
- Didn't Paul tell you?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.620
This place belonged
to Ken and Barb Doll.

08:08.622 --> 08:13.625
It's been sitting empty for
years since the murders.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.927
- The bitch went and
chopped up her husband

08:15.929 --> 08:18.697
and son on Valentine's Day.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.865
Total psycho.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.134
The daughters went crazy, got

08:23.136 --> 08:25.871
sent to some
nuthouse after that.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.874
This is a little
anniversary party.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.613
- I'm kinda the one
to blame for it.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.081
My idea.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.516
- Chyna told us about this
place a few weeks ago.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.852
We've been partying
here ever since.

08:40.854 --> 08:45.924
No power, running water, but
got these dope camping lights.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.425
- Great.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.730
- The house technically still
belongs to the girls but,

08:51.732 --> 08:54.499
you know, they're
still locked up, so,

08:54.501 --> 08:57.068
it's just been
sitting here empty

08:57.070 --> 08:59.704
waiting for a bunch
of crazy kids like us

08:59.706 --> 09:01.473
to come and make use of it.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.142
- We might as well
since no one else is.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.344
- Momma Doll must have
been a pain freak.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.146
She cut her own
jugular at the end.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.614
- Ew, gross.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.515
- Bullshit.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.850
- I wouldn't shit ya.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.451
You're my favorite turd.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.720
- You guys were always
so mean to those girls.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.955
(laughing)

09:16.957 --> 09:18.023
- Me?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.558
How about you?

09:19.560 --> 09:23.628
Didn't you snot rocket in
your drink at lunch once?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.964
Come on, let's go get lost.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.401
(laughs) Oh, man.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.870
I can't believe you brought
Julie along for Kenny.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.472
That dude will stick
his dick in anything.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.574
- You're so mean.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.442
- Man, I can't help it.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.678
That mutey gives me the creeps.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.080
- [Mira] Where are we going?

09:43.183 --> 09:46.551
- Some place where we
can get some one-on-one.

09:46.553 --> 09:51.623
(suspenseful music)
(door creaks)

09:52.759 --> 09:55.694
Got a little mood
lighting going on.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.963
- Who lived up here?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.398
It looks like a
little girl's room.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.967
- Who cares, baby?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.702
These people were weirdos.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.603
Fuck it.

10:06.907 --> 10:11.076
Anyways, it's a good place
to touch on your body.

10:13.547 --> 10:17.282
- I'm gonna get a
beer, do you want one?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.183
- Yeah.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.053
I'll just look around.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.005
(dramatic music)

10:44.878 --> 10:45.810
- This sucks.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.279
I shoulda brought my own car.

10:50.384 --> 10:53.251
Great, then it'll
be a real party.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.221
- Where's the beer?

10:58.025 --> 11:00.659
(bag clatters)

11:02.596 --> 11:07.232
So, Julie, you finally
gonna get popped tonight?

11:07.234 --> 11:08.733
Maybe that's what you need.

11:08.735 --> 11:13.405
Some good D to help you hit
the high notes (laughs).

11:15.742 --> 11:19.344
- This is, like, the
lamest party ever.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.712
Let's roam.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.449
- O-M-G, I was
just thinking that.

11:29.956 --> 11:33.358
You two bitches have
fun being lame A-F.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.066
- You know, maybe she's right.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.469
No, Mira, you dumbass.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.173
You do need to get laid.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.941
Kenny's not that
hard to look at.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.911
Plus, I hear he's
got a nice penis.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.017
- Whoops.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.853
What are you wearing?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.323
- Kiss My Face.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.192
- What?
- Kiss My Face lotion.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.493
Do you like it?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.528
It's totally natural,
no testing on animals.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.732
- Yeah, totally, I'm,
I'm so down for PETA.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.033
- Hey, do you want to
go some place with me

12:15.035 --> 12:16.835
to finish this off?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.236
- Yeah, totally.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.573
Let's go to the basement.

12:22.609 --> 12:26.511
- O-M-G, that's totally creepy.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.546
- Give me your hand.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.348
- But it's too dark.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.685
- That's why God
created iPhones, babe.

12:34.621 --> 12:35.954
Come on.
- Okay.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.428
- Hey, I got you a beer.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.163
Jon.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.304
(bottle clanging)

12:54.407 --> 12:58.009
(door creaking)
(ghostly whispering)

12:58.011 --> 13:00.578
(tense music)

13:03.917 --> 13:06.851
(glass shattering)

13:11.958 --> 13:12.824
- Here.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.029
Damn, get after it.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.435
Oh my God, your
hands are so soft.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.272
Literally just
like a baby panda.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.045
And your eyes really
sparkle in the light.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.989
- O-M-F-G, you dyke!

13:47.060 --> 13:48.293
- Wait, Sandy!

13:50.964 --> 13:51.830
Stupid.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.402
(dramatic music)

14:04.044 --> 14:06.411
- Hey, Sandy, what's
wrong with you?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.314
- Mind your own fucking
business, loser.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.249
Who are you, anyways?

14:11.251 --> 14:14.152
- I've known you since
the second grade.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.455
- Shows what an
impression you've made!

14:21.228 --> 14:22.060
(door slams)

14:22.062 --> 14:22.994
- You know what?

14:22.996 --> 14:25.396
It's been a long time coming.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.532
Hey, bitch!

14:27.534 --> 14:30.368
You better watch
your fucking back!

14:32.505 --> 14:35.340
(dramatic music)

15:14.948 --> 15:17.515
(door creaks)

15:23.456 --> 15:26.124
Oh, Paul and Kenny are here.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.458
- Howdy, Julie.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.205
(dramatic music)

15:47.547 --> 15:50.381
- Come on, I need
some alone time.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.549
- Yes, ma'am.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.553
When a lady is in a need,

15:55.555 --> 15:58.790
a gentleman must
rise to the occasion.

16:06.833 --> 16:07.732
- Hey.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.355
(suspenseful music)

16:31.691 --> 16:35.259
- You don't know how
long I've wanted you.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.301
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:43.303 --> 16:48.006
You know you gotta be
knee-high to get on this ride.

16:48.008 --> 16:51.342
(heavy breathing)

16:51.344 --> 16:54.312
Oh, girl, hold on,
watch the teeth.

16:58.852 --> 16:59.751
Yeehaw!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.707
- I'm so fucking stupid.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.944
(glass shatters)

17:26.946 --> 17:30.014
(suspenseful music)

17:36.656 --> 17:39.357
- Even though they
offered me a scholarship,

17:39.359 --> 17:42.794
I'm waiting to hear
back from UCLA.

17:42.796 --> 17:45.196
I think my chances are good.

17:47.901 --> 17:48.800
Hey.

17:52.772 --> 17:56.541
Come on, Julie, I, I thought
you were here for me.

17:56.543 --> 18:00.511
I'm just trying to be
spontaneous, you know?

18:00.513 --> 18:04.749
Just trying to get famil--
(slaps)

18:11.224 --> 18:12.390
Fuckin' cunt.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.797
(dramatic music)

18:22.168 --> 18:24.001
Hey there, doll face.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.672
Where did you come from?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.073
You from school?

18:30.477 --> 18:35.413
(suspenseful music)
No, I woulda remembered you.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.614
Why don't you come
have a drink with me,

18:36.616 --> 18:39.050
you can tell me the
name of your teddy bear.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.184
- [Doll-face] Pretty?

18:40.186 --> 18:41.686
- (scoffs) Pretty?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.988
I'm sure you're pretty enough.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.158
(glass smashing)
(dramatic music)

18:47.160 --> 18:48.893
- [Doll-face] Pretty!

18:52.665 --> 18:55.233
(Julie sighs)

19:05.979 --> 19:08.813
(dramatic music)

19:22.028 --> 19:24.762
(door slamming)

19:30.503 --> 19:32.503
(metal clattering)

19:32.505 --> 19:33.404
Pretty.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.008
Pretty!

19:38.978 --> 19:41.812
(flesh thudding)

19:51.758 --> 19:54.759
(flesh squelching)

20:03.002 --> 20:05.570
(tense music)

20:25.892 --> 20:30.962
(flesh thudding)
(chain clattering)

20:37.804 --> 20:38.703
- Why?

20:40.173 --> 20:43.040
Why did you kill my sister?

20:43.042 --> 20:44.342
She didn't do anything to you!

20:44.344 --> 20:46.877
She was just confused!

20:46.879 --> 20:48.112
(heavy breathing)

20:48.114 --> 20:51.315
We only wanted those
who tortured us.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.451
Even after I took
care of our parents,

20:53.453 --> 20:56.120
we were treated like
rats in that madhouse.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.322
(children giggling)
Now, now, Dolly,

20:58.324 --> 21:00.791
don't listen to those kids.

21:00.793 --> 21:04.895
With your new mask,
you'll always be pretty.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.530
We finally escaped.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.201
New names but old scars.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.270
See, that's the thing,
you were different.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.704
You weren't like the others.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.306
Look what you did!

21:15.308 --> 21:18.843
Now, get into that
basement and stay there.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.911
You'll always be pretty.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.615
Why'd you have to
kill my sister?

21:31.357 --> 21:33.257
(heavy breathing)

21:33.259 --> 21:34.925
My pretty sister.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.427
(flesh thudding)

21:36.429 --> 21:40.131
- And the house burned down
to the ground soon after that.

21:40.133 --> 21:44.902
And the mask was found in the
basement, amongst the ashes.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.971
And they never found Chyna.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.207
She went missing,
just like her sister.

21:50.209 --> 21:53.778
Now, some say they both
burned up in there together.

21:53.780 --> 21:57.248
But others, others
weren't quite so sure.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.422
- Do you think vengeance
brought her peace?

22:04.424 --> 22:07.058
- Well, I know I'd feel better.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.995
Wouldn't you, Miss,

22:10.997 --> 22:13.631
I'm sorry, we haven't
been properly introduced.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.467
My name is Rosemont,
Thaddeus Rosemont.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.069
- Amelia.

22:18.071 --> 22:18.969
- Amelia?

22:20.340 --> 22:23.407
Have we met somewhere
before, Amelia?

22:23.409 --> 22:24.875
- I don't think so.

22:24.877 --> 22:29.480
- Well, I have the strangest
feeling that we have.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.449
But I must be mistaken.

22:33.086 --> 22:36.087
So, what do you
say about the mask?

22:37.690 --> 22:41.025
- I say I'm not so
sure about that one.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.296
- That's fine,
we'll keep looking.

22:45.298 --> 22:48.599
(gentle holiday music)

22:58.478 --> 23:00.277
- What about that doll?

23:00.279 --> 23:01.512
She might like that.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.813
- Oh, the doll.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.052
That doll has a very
interesting story.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.255
It is no ordinary plaything.

23:12.325 --> 23:15.192
It was made in
Germany, by a rabbi.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.261
Centuries ago, very old.

23:18.531 --> 23:22.533
And I got it from some
very distraught parents.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.837
(dramatic music)

23:42.355 --> 23:43.654
- Happy Hanukah, Kevin.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.489
- Happy Hanukah, son.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.227
Now (claps).

23:50.229 --> 23:53.297
Are you ready for
your last present?

24:05.044 --> 24:07.077
We hope you like it.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.214
We got it a very
old shop in Germany.

24:12.218 --> 24:15.019
(paper crinkling)

24:41.581 --> 24:44.515
Now, that is a
very special doll.

24:44.517 --> 24:45.749
Very old.

24:45.751 --> 24:49.053
It was made by a
rabbi a long time ago.

24:52.425 --> 24:55.259
- There's only one of
them in the whole world.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.495
And now he belongs to you.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.503
- Thanks, Mom, thanks, Dad.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.274
- You're welcome.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.043
Hopefully he'll be a
good friend for you.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.278
- And he'll keep you company

25:14.280 --> 25:17.348
while we're away on
our business trip.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.949
- When are you leaving?

25:18.951 --> 25:20.451
- Tonight.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.319
Well, don't you remember?

25:22.321 --> 25:25.022
We have to leave late
to take the red eye.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.392
- But you can play with
your doll while we're away.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.361
I'm sure you two will
have lots of fun.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.530
- Yeah, and Lisa is coming over

25:32.532 --> 25:34.999
to watch you for the weekend.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.537
- Don't you like Lisa?

25:40.606 --> 25:41.505
- I guess.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.716
(dramatic music)

25:52.718 --> 25:55.052
(knocking)

26:00.726 --> 26:02.426
- [Stan] Lisa, hi!

26:02.428 --> 26:04.228
- Hi, Mr. Cohen.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.063
- Please, come on in.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.968
(door shutting)

26:13.439 --> 26:14.638
- Hello, Lisa.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.907
- Hi, Mrs. Cohen.

26:17.977 --> 26:21.345
- Okay, we'll be coming
back 11 a.m. Sunday.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.814
Now, there's plenty of
food in the refrigerator

26:23.816 --> 26:26.283
and there's money on the counter
in case you need anything

26:26.285 --> 26:28.686
and here are the house keys.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.358
- Kevin got a new toy, so
he's up in his room playing.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.195
I'm sure he will be
busy for the evening.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.830
- Right, huh.

26:39.832 --> 26:40.965
Kids.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.299
Gotta love 'em.

26:43.336 --> 26:45.569
- Okay, we're out of here.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.406
Okay, you call if
you need anything.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.307
- I will.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.711
Bye, Stan, bye, Janet.

26:54.547 --> 26:55.512
- By, Lisa.

26:57.450 --> 27:02.519
- Have fun in Germany or
Deutschland (chuckles).

27:03.289 --> 27:04.355
Or whatever.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.425
(door slams)

27:08.427 --> 27:09.326
Kevin?

27:13.766 --> 27:14.832
Little brat.

27:20.039 --> 27:25.109
(door slams)
(heavy breathing)

27:40.926 --> 27:42.860
Yeah, well, they're gonna
be back Sunday morning,

27:42.862 --> 27:45.295
so we gotta get this
done before then.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.797
- Yeah, yeah, no,
I mean, I hear you,

27:46.799 --> 27:50.834
I just ain't trying to roll
out there that soon, you know?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.102
- Well, find a way
to get here quick

27:52.104 --> 27:55.539
because we're running
out of fucking time.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.074
- Excuse me?

27:57.076 --> 27:59.410
Who the fuck do you think you're
talking to like that, huh?

27:59.412 --> 28:04.081
I ain't even about to
hear this shit right now.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.650
(sighs)

28:06.652 --> 28:08.752
- Oh, come on, baby.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.754
Don't you love me?

28:10.756 --> 28:14.358
Don't you want us
to have nice things?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.261
- Yeah, yeah, you
know I do, girl.

28:18.097 --> 28:21.165
- Hm, that's what I thought.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.468
Now, I've been babysitting
this little fuck

28:24.470 --> 28:28.105
every weekend for three
months just so we can do this.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.607
All right, this
family is loaded.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.476
They have all their
valuables stashed

28:32.478 --> 28:35.979
in a secret room downstairs
and I have the key, okay?

28:35.981 --> 28:41.051
We sell what we get here and
we'll be set for life, baby.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.654
- Yeah, yeah, that
sounds good, huh.

28:43.656 --> 28:45.956
- Yeah, the jewelry
collection alone

28:45.958 --> 28:48.192
has gotta be worth almost a mil.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.395
We sell that, we move to Mexico.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.031
I can be your little señorita.

28:54.033 --> 28:57.034
Serve you cocktails
on the beach,

28:57.036 --> 29:00.571
wear those sexy
outfits you like and.

29:00.573 --> 29:04.475
(door creaks)
You little shit!

29:05.611 --> 29:07.678
- Yo, you there?

29:07.680 --> 29:09.747
Yo, baby, what was that?

29:11.951 --> 29:12.883
- Baby?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.318
Who the fuck you calling baby?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.320
- Yo, shut the fuck up!

29:19.725 --> 29:22.526
- Open the door,
you little brat!

29:26.732 --> 29:29.767
You were gonna spy on me, huh?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.102
Planning on calling
Mommy and Daddy, too?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.772
I have worked long
and hard for this.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.141
I've earned this and if
you think I'm gonna let

29:37.143 --> 29:40.677
a little shit like you
stand in the way of that,

29:40.679 --> 29:42.613
you're dead wrong, you hear me?

29:42.615 --> 29:44.681
- I, I--
- You, you what?

29:45.818 --> 29:47.151
I'll tell you what
you're gonna do.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.052
You're gonna sit
here, in your room,

29:49.054 --> 29:52.256
for the entire weekend,
until your parents get home.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.690
And then they're gonna come back

29:53.692 --> 29:58.295
and find everything in
their precious mansion gone.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.596
Except for you.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.566
What would I want with you?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.735
You're just a stupid kid.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.810
Now go play with
your stupid doll!

30:16.148 --> 30:21.118
(door shuts)
(lock clicks)

30:26.826 --> 30:29.393
(Kevin sighs)

30:31.864 --> 30:33.730
Baby, you there?

30:33.732 --> 30:35.566
- Yeah, yeah, no,
no, no, I'm here.

30:35.568 --> 30:37.367
What the fuck was that?!

30:37.369 --> 30:40.537
- Sorry, little kid
was spying on me.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.207
But don't worry,
I took care of it.

30:43.209 --> 30:47.044
¶ Coming back with 17 ¶

30:47.046 --> 30:49.046
- Now, be here around
three in the morning,

30:49.048 --> 30:51.114
okay, all the neighbors
should be asleep by then.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.417
I'll text you the address.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.018
- All right, peace.

30:56.655 --> 30:57.788
- I love you.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.358
Ugh!

31:04.063 --> 31:06.930
- What the fuck was that about?

31:06.932 --> 31:08.165
- Yo, I don't have time to deal

31:08.167 --> 31:09.433
with this shit right
now, all right?

31:09.435 --> 31:11.535
I gotta go and so do you.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.707
- You gotta be fucking joking!

31:16.709 --> 31:19.176
How the fuck am I supposed
to get home, Trey?

31:19.178 --> 31:22.379
- I don't think you'll have
a hard time finding a ride.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.248
Just show 'em some skin.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.782
- You fucking asshole.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.050
Fuck you!

31:27.052 --> 31:28.452
- Get the fuck outta
the car, all right?

31:28.454 --> 31:29.853
Peace, bitch!

31:29.855 --> 31:31.922
(Trey laughs)
(door slams)

31:31.924 --> 31:33.991
(tires screeching)

31:33.993 --> 31:36.126
- I hope you fucking die!

31:57.082 --> 31:59.116
- Why can't you help me?

32:01.520 --> 32:03.420
Can't do anything.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.622
You're just a stupid doll.

32:11.664 --> 32:15.132
I'm too old to be
playing with you anyway.

32:16.769 --> 32:21.838
(Kevin groans)
(dramatic music)

32:34.653 --> 32:38.055
"If trouble finds
you, help will arrive.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.627
"Read these words
and he will rise.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.231
"In the light, in the night,

32:50.302 --> 32:53.537
"rise of my will
with all your might."

32:54.974 --> 32:59.776
(rustling)
(Kevin gasps)

33:00.980 --> 33:04.348
(dramatic music)

33:04.350 --> 33:06.316
Are, are you my friend?

33:12.691 --> 33:14.491
Are you gonna help me?

33:35.080 --> 33:38.148
(dishes clattering)

33:39.184 --> 33:41.251
- Made in England, 1895.

33:42.554 --> 33:43.687
Huh, jackpot!

33:44.957 --> 33:50.027
(gasps)
(plate clatters)

33:50.262 --> 33:50.994
Shit!

33:54.133 --> 33:55.465
Little bastard!

33:56.301 --> 33:59.136
(dramatic music)

34:05.310 --> 34:07.244
He better fucking
be in his room.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.713
(Lisa yells)

34:28.500 --> 34:31.468
Where are you, you little shit?

34:31.470 --> 34:33.804
Are you trying to scare me?

34:35.541 --> 34:39.009
Why don't you come
out so I can see you?!

34:43.115 --> 34:46.016
All right, you
want to play games?

34:46.018 --> 34:47.184
Let's play.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.986
(dramatic music)

34:54.359 --> 34:55.792
If you think I'm
afraid to hurt you,

34:55.794 --> 34:59.629
you've got another thing
coming, you hear me?

35:00.732 --> 35:02.866
You think I've never
cut a kid before?

35:02.868 --> 35:04.634
Huh, that's nothing!

35:06.238 --> 35:09.306
I've cut kids and I
will take great joy

35:09.308 --> 35:12.142
in cutting your
fucking head off!

35:37.669 --> 35:40.237
Are you in there,
you little creep?

35:40.239 --> 35:42.806
(door creaks)

36:11.670 --> 36:12.569
Kevin!

36:35.727 --> 36:38.195
(door slams)

36:39.097 --> 36:41.698
(dramatic music)

36:41.700 --> 36:44.534
(Trey groans)

36:44.536 --> 36:45.435
Trey?

36:47.372 --> 36:52.309
(groaning)
(body thuds)

36:52.311 --> 36:53.210
Baby?

36:54.112 --> 36:55.011
Baby?

36:57.015 --> 36:59.015
No, no, no, no, no, no!

37:00.419 --> 37:03.053
(Kevin laughs)

37:04.823 --> 37:06.957
I'm gonna kill you!

37:06.959 --> 37:09.626
(Kevin laughs)

37:18.604 --> 37:20.170
You're dead, dead!

37:24.409 --> 37:25.308
Come out!

37:26.078 --> 37:27.244
Come out now!

37:28.046 --> 37:31.248
(dramatic music)

37:31.250 --> 37:36.152
(screams)
(body thudding)

37:55.240 --> 37:56.306
- Poor Lisa.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.576
Poor Lisa's boyfriend.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.347
They shouldn't have
tried to steal from us.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.853
Can you get rid of them
before Mom and Dad get home?

38:09.855 --> 38:12.689
(dramatic music)

39:06.878 --> 39:07.777
- Kevin!

39:08.680 --> 39:09.579
Lisa!

39:10.949 --> 39:12.115
- We're home!

39:14.052 --> 39:16.553
(door shuts)

39:22.961 --> 39:24.327
- Oh!

39:24.329 --> 39:26.196
Whoa there, cowboy.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.732
- I just missed you, that's all.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.867
- Oh, we missed you, too.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.037
Where's Lisa?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.606
- She left with her boyfriend.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.310
They were gonna steal
a bunch of stuff but

39:40.312 --> 39:44.381
he came over and they got
into a fight and left.

39:45.684 --> 39:46.750
- Boyfriend?

39:47.753 --> 39:49.319
You've gotta be kidding me.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.287
The nerve of that girl!

39:52.691 --> 39:56.693
Well, she's never gonna work
in this neighborhood again.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.328
- I'll say.

39:58.330 --> 40:02.565
- Yeah, the important thing
is Kevin is all right.

40:06.138 --> 40:09.139
You're all right,
aren't you, pal?

40:09.141 --> 40:14.210
Hey, did you get a chance
to play with your new doll?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.147
(sinister music)

40:31.563 --> 40:34.364
(dramatic music)

40:36.768 --> 40:40.403
- And the doll hasn't moved
on its own since then.

40:40.405 --> 40:42.138
It's been very quiet
since I got it and,

40:42.140 --> 40:45.809
lucky for both of us,
I don't speak Hebrew.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.046
- You're telling me you
believe that doll did all that?

40:50.048 --> 40:52.182
- It doesn't matter
what I believe.

40:52.184 --> 40:55.218
It matters what the couple
who sold it to me believe.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.755
What I related to is
what their son told them

40:58.757 --> 41:00.623
when they took the doll away.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.658
He believed.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.962
And the question now
is do you believe?

41:07.599 --> 41:09.699
- I believe all sorts of things.

41:09.701 --> 41:14.437
I have a very open mind but
I don't know about that.

41:14.439 --> 41:17.040
- Well, an open mind is a
wonderful thing to have.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.374
Don't ever lose it.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.343
- I'll try not to.

41:20.345 --> 41:21.911
- Good.

41:21.913 --> 41:25.582
So, you think your sister
would like the doll?

41:25.584 --> 41:27.417
- Oh, I'm sure she would.

41:27.419 --> 41:29.652
But I don't know if I
want to be responsible

41:29.654 --> 41:32.655
if he starts to
wreak havoc again.

41:32.657 --> 41:36.559
- (laughs) That's
perfectly understandable.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.027
So let's just keep looking until

41:38.029 --> 41:40.230
something catches
your eye, shall we?

41:40.232 --> 41:41.297
- All right.

41:42.367 --> 41:45.702
(gentle holiday music)

41:59.384 --> 42:01.317
What's this, Christmas special?

42:01.319 --> 42:04.988
- Oh (laughs), no, but

42:04.990 --> 42:07.957
that suit is quite
special, indeed.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.961
- Dare I ask where you got it?

42:11.963 --> 42:15.832
- Well, I have a friend
who works at the morgue

42:17.769 --> 42:19.636
and sometimes he
brings me things,

42:19.638 --> 42:22.739
things that come in
with the bodies and

42:22.741 --> 42:25.808
this suit belonged
to a particularly

42:27.412 --> 42:30.780
disturbed man, according
to the police report

42:30.782 --> 42:33.016
that he read to me.

42:33.018 --> 42:38.087
(jingling bells)
(dramatic music)

42:46.831 --> 42:50.133
- No, I don't think I'll ever
get over it, quite frankly.

42:50.135 --> 42:53.570
No, I'm kidding, I'm
kidding, that's great.

42:53.572 --> 42:55.772
That's great, good news.

42:55.774 --> 42:58.408
Well, why don't you
get off your phone,

42:58.410 --> 43:00.877
go out and celebrate, huh?

43:00.879 --> 43:03.079
No, no, I'm, I'm on the wagon.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.748
But have a couple
for me, all right.

43:05.750 --> 43:09.319
All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

43:09.321 --> 43:10.253
Hey, honey.

43:15.427 --> 43:16.893
How was your day?

43:18.029 --> 43:19.362
- Well, I made beef
stew and pork chops

43:19.364 --> 43:22.031
but you missed that again.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.199
How was work?

43:24.903 --> 43:26.970
- Tom got the promotion.

43:27.772 --> 43:28.671
- What?

43:29.541 --> 43:30.440
- Yeah.

43:35.347 --> 43:36.412
- How'd you screw
that up, Chris?

43:36.414 --> 43:38.648
You had seniority.

43:38.650 --> 43:39.882
- I don't know.

43:39.884 --> 43:44.253
I guess, sometimes, the
best guy gets the job.

43:44.255 --> 43:45.288
- Well, with that
kind of attitude,

43:45.290 --> 43:48.458
no wonder he got the promotion.

43:48.460 --> 43:51.361
When are you gonna stand
up for yourself for once?

43:51.363 --> 43:52.295
If you don't, you're just gonna

43:52.297 --> 43:54.897
keep getting walked all over.

43:54.899 --> 43:57.967
- Yeah, yeah, you're
probably right.

44:09.080 --> 44:12.081
You look beautiful, Susan.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.549
- Chris.

44:13.551 --> 44:16.319
- Come on, why don't you have
a seat down here with me?

44:16.321 --> 44:18.821
I could really use a hug.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.790
- Let's just go to bed.

44:42.147 --> 44:44.147
Jesus Christ, Christopher.

44:44.149 --> 44:45.615
- Come on, honey.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.987
Don't you miss it?

44:50.989 --> 44:53.322
Don't you miss making love?

44:58.196 --> 44:59.429
- No, I don't miss it.

44:59.431 --> 45:00.930
And, no, I don't want
to have sex with you now

45:00.932 --> 45:04.867
nor do I want to have sex
with you any time soon.

45:05.970 --> 45:08.938
- I don't, what is
the matter with you?

45:08.940 --> 45:10.406
Is it my weight?

45:10.408 --> 45:13.276
I mean, I quit smoking
for you, I quit drinking.

45:13.278 --> 45:15.244
It's natural to put
on a few pounds.

45:15.246 --> 45:16.546
- Yes.
- It's not like I'm grotesque.

45:16.548 --> 45:19.682
- Yes, it's your weight, Chris.

45:19.684 --> 45:20.616
And if you were
half as interested

45:20.618 --> 45:21.818
in getting a promotion at work

45:21.820 --> 45:24.253
as you were in gobbling
down another Ho Ho,

45:24.255 --> 45:28.658
you might have had a chance
of getting your bump up.

45:29.494 --> 45:31.894
- That's pretty damn harsh.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.696
- Well, maybe that's
what you need.

45:33.698 --> 45:35.765
A harsh dose of reality.

45:37.969 --> 45:38.868
Goodnight.

45:53.818 --> 45:57.720
- [Chris] Don't forget
to turn out the lights.

46:03.428 --> 46:05.661
(snoring)

46:17.408 --> 46:19.375
- Good morning, Daddy.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.077
- Good morning, sweetheart.

46:21.079 --> 46:23.412
- Mommy says you're
going to be late.

46:23.414 --> 46:25.081
- Oh, okay, I'm up.

46:27.585 --> 46:28.484
Thank you.

46:29.521 --> 46:30.419
Kissy?

46:34.325 --> 46:35.958
Have a great day.

46:35.960 --> 46:36.859
- You too.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.732
- You all ready, you
got your books, folder?

46:42.734 --> 46:43.866
- Yep.
- Okay.

46:46.104 --> 46:48.938
Okay, have a good day, okay?

46:48.940 --> 46:51.507
(door creaks)

46:56.014 --> 46:57.780
- Good morning.

46:57.782 --> 46:59.382
Is that cup for me?

46:59.384 --> 47:01.317
- Oh, this one has almond milk.

47:01.319 --> 47:03.219
There's some more in the pot.

47:03.221 --> 47:05.288
What time is the
Christmas party tonight?

47:05.290 --> 47:06.589
- Oh, it's at six.

47:06.591 --> 47:08.491
Hey, where's the Santa suit?

47:08.493 --> 47:10.393
- It's right down
there, in the bag.

47:10.395 --> 47:12.328
- And who's taking
care of Crissy?

47:12.330 --> 47:13.563
- Colleen.

47:13.565 --> 47:15.498
She'll drop her back
off tomorrow morning.

47:15.500 --> 47:19.268
- So we'll have the
place to ourselves.

47:19.270 --> 47:21.337
- You're not gonna
drink tonight, are you?

47:21.339 --> 47:23.339
(sighs)

47:23.341 --> 47:26.108
- I've been dry for
a full year now.

47:26.110 --> 47:28.611
- Yeah, well, I still
remember last year.

47:28.613 --> 47:33.683
- Well, it's literally been
365 days, you know, let it go.

47:34.986 --> 47:37.286
All right, I gotta get
dressed, I gotta get ready.

47:37.288 --> 47:38.888
I'll see ya tonight.

47:38.890 --> 47:40.122
- [Susan] Bye.

47:40.959 --> 47:41.858
- Bye.

47:50.602 --> 47:52.802
(cars honking)
I'm telling you, Sam,

47:52.804 --> 47:54.637
Sunshine Industries
is back in the saddle.

47:54.639 --> 47:57.006
We've been kicking ass and
taking names, quite frankly.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.475
I just bought some
more stock, in fact.

47:59.477 --> 48:03.246
Uh-huh.
(phone ringing)

48:03.248 --> 48:05.948
Well, yeah, we had some
setbacks a while back, but,

48:05.950 --> 48:09.185
you know, we had the shortage
of the blue sunshine but

48:09.187 --> 48:10.486
we ramped up production on that

48:10.488 --> 48:13.055
and the red sunshine,
may I reiterate,

48:13.057 --> 48:15.224
there has never been any
substantial test results

48:15.226 --> 48:16.859
that show any
correlation between

48:16.861 --> 48:20.129
the use of red sunshine
and all those suicides.

48:20.131 --> 48:21.631
- Chris?

48:21.633 --> 48:23.866
- And you can quote on me
on that and I hope you will.

48:23.868 --> 48:25.067
Yeah.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.402
Look, uh, I really
appreciate you

48:26.404 --> 48:28.437
doing the article
on the company and

48:28.439 --> 48:29.839
I'm gonna send you over
some product samples

48:29.841 --> 48:31.607
of the black sunshine.

48:31.609 --> 48:34.143
Yeah, God knows that makes you

48:34.145 --> 48:36.679
the life of the party
in your bedroom, huh?

48:36.681 --> 48:39.548
Okay, that's on its way and
I appreciate it, thanks.

48:39.550 --> 48:41.050
Talk to you soon.

48:41.986 --> 48:44.553
Yeah (claps).

48:46.291 --> 48:47.590
(knocking)

48:47.592 --> 48:48.591
Mr. Donaldson?

48:48.593 --> 48:50.726
- Chris, come on in.

48:50.728 --> 48:52.862
Hey, take a look at this.

48:54.899 --> 48:55.932
- Biacin?

48:55.934 --> 48:58.034
What, we run out of colors?

48:58.036 --> 49:00.169
- Just something the boys
in the lab cooked up.

49:00.171 --> 49:02.939
It's for little old
ladies with dementia.

49:02.941 --> 49:05.207
See if you can get someone
at Ding Biscuits Monthly

49:05.209 --> 49:07.910
to write up an
article about 'em.

49:07.912 --> 49:09.445
- And how are they?

49:09.447 --> 49:12.315
- Tell you what, I had one
of 'em and a shot of Jack.

49:12.317 --> 49:14.650
Stared at static on
the TV for three hours.

49:14.652 --> 49:16.052
Best time I've
had since college.

49:16.054 --> 49:18.020
- (laughs) Well,
I'll get started

49:18.022 --> 49:20.156
on the press kit
right away, sir.

49:20.158 --> 49:22.625
- Yeah, one more thing.

49:22.627 --> 49:24.026
Sit down, Chris.

49:25.596 --> 49:28.264
You've been a great employee
at this company for,

49:28.266 --> 49:30.733
what, now, nine years?

49:30.735 --> 49:32.969
- That's right, sir.

49:32.971 --> 49:35.504
- Well, I just want
you to know that

49:35.506 --> 49:39.809
Sunshine really appreciates
all the hard work you do.

49:39.811 --> 49:41.644
And I know you were
expecting that promotion

49:41.646 --> 49:44.547
because you've got seniority.

49:44.549 --> 49:48.651
But Tom, he's got something
that really represents

49:48.653 --> 49:52.455
what this company's
about, he's a go-getter.

49:52.457 --> 49:54.056
He's a great leader.

49:54.058 --> 49:56.859
If I can see more of
those qualities from you,

49:56.861 --> 50:00.496
then we can have this
conversation again.

50:00.498 --> 50:01.430
But first, you've gotta show me

50:01.432 --> 50:03.666
you really know how to hack it.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.034
Speak of the devil, Tom!

50:05.036 --> 50:07.269
- Hey (laughs), hidey ho!

50:07.271 --> 50:08.637
- [Donaldson] We were
just talking about you.

50:08.639 --> 50:10.573
- Only good stuff, I hope?

50:10.575 --> 50:12.041
- Well, I was just
explaining to Chris here

50:12.043 --> 50:14.276
about some of the qualities
the company needs.

50:14.278 --> 50:18.481
- Yeah, well, I hope that I
meet those qualities, sir.

50:18.483 --> 50:21.450
- Five years on the team and
we're all the better for it.

50:21.452 --> 50:24.453
- Hey, you're still gonna
be our St. Nick, right?

50:24.455 --> 50:25.521
- Sure thing.

50:25.523 --> 50:27.523
I've got the suit.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.592
- Yeah, well, we've
gotta have our Santa.

50:29.594 --> 50:32.395
But let's try not to have
a scene like last year.

50:32.397 --> 50:34.263
(Tom laughs)
Behavior like that is

50:34.265 --> 50:36.932
not proper for the workplace.

50:36.934 --> 50:39.101
- Jesus, that was a riot.

50:40.204 --> 50:41.470
- I guess Rudolph
wasn't the only one

50:41.472 --> 50:44.006
with a red nose that night, huh?

50:44.008 --> 50:45.941
- Well, gentlemen, I've got
some work waiting for me,

50:45.943 --> 50:47.343
so, if you'll excuse me.
- Okay.

50:47.345 --> 50:49.445
We still have 18
holes on Saturday?

50:49.447 --> 50:50.713
- You bet.

50:50.715 --> 50:51.914
And it's not gonna end
like the last game.

50:51.916 --> 50:52.848
(Tom laughs)

50:52.850 --> 50:53.883
- We'll see.

50:55.887 --> 50:57.787
Hey, Chris, no hard
feelings, right?

50:57.789 --> 51:00.322
- No, I'm fine, congrats.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.792
My pride might hold a grudge.

51:12.770 --> 51:15.304
(upbeat music)

51:19.377 --> 51:24.380
¶ And so it's Christmas ¶

51:24.382 --> 51:29.452
¶ Hear the festive
music in the air ¶

51:31.722 --> 51:36.792
¶ See the smiling
faces everywhere ¶

51:39.063 --> 51:42.965
¶ They stop and stare ¶

51:42.967 --> 51:46.035
¶ Another Christmas ¶

51:47.505 --> 51:51.107
¶ Time to celebrate ¶
- Santa.

51:51.109 --> 51:53.375
(Chris chuckles)

51:53.377 --> 51:55.611
What are you gonna
fill my stocking with?

51:55.613 --> 51:58.280
- Well, that depends,
have you been naughty?

51:58.282 --> 52:00.883
- Oh, just a little.
- Oh, well,

52:02.053 --> 52:04.353
I'll only put a little
bit of coal in there.

52:04.355 --> 52:09.358
- No, Santa, I don't want any
coal, I want something sweet.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.293
- Well, you seem sweet.

52:11.295 --> 52:13.629
I'll see what I can do.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.931
Oh, you are sweet.

52:15.933 --> 52:21.003
¶ Have a happy
Christmas and New Year ¶

52:23.508 --> 52:26.876
¶ Have a very Merry Christmas ¶

52:26.878 --> 52:31.413
¶ Christmas time is here ¶

52:31.415 --> 52:35.985
¶ Have a happy
Christmas and New Year ¶

52:40.424 --> 52:43.826
(man and woman moaning)

52:45.530 --> 52:47.129
- [Susan] Yes!

52:47.131 --> 52:51.133
- [Tom] Oh, Merry
Christmas, Merry Christmas!

52:51.135 --> 52:52.535
Merry Christmas!

52:53.771 --> 52:55.104
Oh my goodness.

52:59.377 --> 53:00.843
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:03.047 --> 53:08.083
¶ Have a very Merry Christmas ¶
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

53:09.220 --> 53:11.987
It's a good ow, yes.
- Oh, yeah, yes, yeah.

53:14.559 --> 53:19.128
- [Tom] Kind of burns, oh
my God, in heaven, oh, yeah.

53:21.132 --> 53:23.766
(upbeat music)

53:32.276 --> 53:35.010
- Double whiskey, neat.

53:35.012 --> 53:37.079
- [Bartender] All right.

53:47.358 --> 53:48.424
Thanks, bud.

54:02.373 --> 54:04.940
(glass slams)

54:05.843 --> 54:06.742
- Again.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.089
Keep it.

54:20.091 --> 54:21.323
- Thanks, bud.

55:02.033 --> 55:04.833
(dramatic music)

55:19.583 --> 55:21.917
(chuckles)

55:23.287 --> 55:24.186
- Hey.

55:27.425 --> 55:28.390
- Go again?

55:33.964 --> 55:36.298
(groaning)

55:41.339 --> 55:44.807
(pills rattling)

55:44.809 --> 55:47.109
(glass slamming)

55:47.111 --> 55:49.345
(moaning)

55:54.452 --> 55:57.953
From the gentleman at
the end of the bar.

56:07.665 --> 56:09.164
- [Tom] Oh, yeah.

56:16.240 --> 56:19.274
- Right?
(wheezing)

56:19.276 --> 56:23.011
You're never right, no
matter what you get her.

56:23.013 --> 56:25.013
Whatever you get her,
you're fucking wrong.

56:25.015 --> 56:26.248
- I know, right?
- So why don't you

56:26.250 --> 56:27.483
just give 'em cash
and have 'em get

56:27.485 --> 56:28.417
their own fuckin'
present, right?

56:28.419 --> 56:30.285
- Exactly.
- Am I right?

56:30.287 --> 56:33.522
- Here, fuckin' cash.
- Give us another one.

56:33.524 --> 56:34.890
Yeah.
- Fuck,

56:34.892 --> 56:36.425
she can just take it all.

56:36.427 --> 56:38.227
- Tom got her some
cock for Christmas.

56:38.229 --> 56:39.928
She seemed to like that.
- What?!

56:39.930 --> 56:44.166
- She's a fuckin', god damn.
- Cock, what the fuck?

56:45.336 --> 56:46.935
God, God.

56:46.937 --> 56:48.504
- Hey, you retire?

56:50.307 --> 56:51.774
- Come on, man,
this is Santa Claus

56:51.776 --> 56:53.842
we're talking about here, he's
got a whole fuckin' night.

56:53.844 --> 56:57.279
- I gotta busy night, I got
shit I gotta get to, right?

56:57.281 --> 57:00.449
Whole fuckin' world, I need
some energy, guys, damn it.

57:00.451 --> 57:03.552
- Whole fuckin' world.
(Chris laughs)

57:03.554 --> 57:05.421
Ah, to Santa.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.055
- I'm starting to
get a runner's rhythm

57:07.057 --> 57:09.291
on this fuckin' shit, man.

57:10.294 --> 57:13.295
(laughs) Right?

57:13.297 --> 57:14.897
You don't know her?

57:14.899 --> 57:17.199
Fuck you and fuck Cleveland!

57:17.201 --> 57:18.267
Yeah.

57:18.269 --> 57:19.368
- Hey!
- What?

57:19.370 --> 57:21.136
- We're done, you're out.

57:21.138 --> 57:23.705
- Fine.
- Get the fuck outta here.

57:23.707 --> 57:25.574
- And now I'm drunk?

57:25.576 --> 57:26.842
Fuck you.

57:26.844 --> 57:28.210
- You're fucking done.
- Fuck you!

57:28.212 --> 57:29.545
- Get the fuck outta here.
- There you go.

57:29.547 --> 57:31.313
Merry Christmas, cocksucker.

57:31.315 --> 57:32.314
- No!
- God damn it.

57:32.316 --> 57:33.782
- Merry fucking Christmas.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.951
You haven't done shit.
- Get the fuck outta here!

57:35.953 --> 57:36.852
We're fucking done!

57:36.854 --> 57:38.454
God damn it.

57:38.456 --> 57:41.190
(Chris cackles)

57:48.933 --> 57:51.300
(dramatic music)

57:54.738 --> 57:56.205
- You motherfucker.

57:56.207 --> 57:57.840
You want to piss in my bar?

57:57.842 --> 57:58.774
I'll give you
something to piss over.

57:58.776 --> 58:01.743
She loved his cock inside her.

58:01.745 --> 58:03.011
- No she didn't.

58:03.013 --> 58:04.279
She did not.

58:04.281 --> 58:07.483
- The fuck is wrong with you?
- She did not.

58:07.485 --> 58:12.387
- You're fucking dead.
(bells ringing)

58:12.389 --> 58:17.392
(flesh thudding)
(bartender groans)

58:19.230 --> 58:22.064
(Chris chuckles)

58:32.309 --> 58:33.275
- Oh, yeah.

58:36.213 --> 58:38.680
(bat clanks)

58:44.555 --> 58:46.355
We're going shopping.

58:47.725 --> 58:50.292
(light music)

58:52.229 --> 58:56.765
Are you just gonna let them run
over you like that, big man?

58:56.767 --> 59:00.068
Or are you gonna do
something about it?

59:01.338 --> 59:04.406
You're nothing but
a two-pump chump.

59:06.143 --> 59:10.345
No wonder she doesn't
want your tiny dick.

59:10.347 --> 59:13.048
They're gonna keep
walking all over you

59:13.050 --> 59:14.583
unless you make them pay.

59:18.155 --> 59:21.657
(dramatic electronic music)

59:21.659 --> 59:24.893
(Tom coughs)

59:24.895 --> 59:25.727
- Mm-hm.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.329
- Barb?

59:27.331 --> 59:29.665
You got a great set of tits!

59:29.667 --> 59:32.401
Let's do this in proper fashion!

59:34.171 --> 59:39.074
One for my right nostril,
one for my left nostril.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.843
(Tom sniffs)

59:41.845 --> 59:44.479
(Tom blubbers)

59:49.153 --> 59:51.453
Oh, I'm high on titty coke.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.990
- Well, thank God
that's over with.

59:54.992 --> 59:57.426
Now I can have a
real party in here.

59:57.428 --> 1:00:01.530
- Mm, so, does this mean I'll
be working late tonight, sir?

1:00:01.532 --> 1:00:05.567
- Yeah, better tell whoever's
at home not to wait up.

1:00:05.569 --> 1:00:08.737
(woman giggles)

1:00:08.739 --> 1:00:10.138
- Mr. Donaldson.

1:00:13.177 --> 1:00:14.343
- Oh, I like that.

1:00:14.345 --> 1:00:15.611
(woman giggles)

1:00:15.613 --> 1:00:17.012
- Oh my God.
- That isn't

1:00:17.014 --> 1:00:19.414
appropriate office
behavior, sir.

1:00:19.416 --> 1:00:22.684
(flesh thudding)
(all screaming)

1:00:22.686 --> 1:00:24.219
Buzzkill, huh?

1:00:24.221 --> 1:00:27.089
(body thuds)
(Chris cackles)

1:00:27.091 --> 1:00:30.759
That's no way to get
ahead in this company!

1:00:32.029 --> 1:00:33.662
Hey.

1:00:33.664 --> 1:00:35.764
Let me ax you something--
- Chris, no.

1:00:35.766 --> 1:00:37.332
- Did I make the cut?

1:00:37.334 --> 1:00:38.934
You know, there seems to
be a little disconnect

1:00:38.936 --> 1:00:40.702
between the two of us, huh?

1:00:40.704 --> 1:00:42.704
- No.
- Some sort of problem.

1:00:42.706 --> 1:00:44.806
You know, maybe if we could
have a little heart-to-heart,

1:00:44.808 --> 1:00:47.909
we could cut right to the
meat of the matter, huh?

1:00:47.911 --> 1:00:50.746
If you got some sort
of problem with me,

1:00:50.748 --> 1:00:52.114
we could bury the hatchet!

1:00:52.116 --> 1:00:54.516
(Donaldson screaming)
(light music)

1:00:54.518 --> 1:00:55.984
- Ho, ho, ho!

1:00:55.986 --> 1:00:59.988
Sounds like someone's having
a good time out there.

1:01:02.026 --> 1:01:02.891
Oh, oh!

1:01:04.261 --> 1:01:06.395
It gets you so high.

1:01:06.397 --> 1:01:08.830
Hey, you missed a spot there.

1:01:09.667 --> 1:01:12.000
(knocking)

1:01:12.002 --> 1:01:16.038
Oh, God damn it, Barb,
would you go get the door.

1:01:17.174 --> 1:01:20.709
¶ And the truth you see ¶

1:01:20.711 --> 1:01:23.545
(dramatic music)

1:01:24.982 --> 1:01:27.015
(body thudding)

1:01:27.017 --> 1:01:28.016
- Hidey ho!

1:01:29.753 --> 1:01:32.287
You stole my job--
- No, no, no, Chris, Chris.

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:33.522
- You had my wife.
- Chris!

1:01:33.524 --> 1:01:34.956
Chris, take it easy, Chris!

1:01:34.958 --> 1:01:37.392
- I feel like I'm getting
fucked with no lube today, Tom.

1:01:37.394 --> 1:01:38.627
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:01:38.629 --> 1:01:40.062
No, no, no, no!

1:01:40.064 --> 1:01:44.533
- You nailed my wife and I
think I'd better nail you, huh?

1:01:44.535 --> 1:01:45.934
- Oh my God, no!

1:01:45.936 --> 1:01:51.006
(flesh squelching)
(Chris laughing)

1:01:53.844 --> 1:01:55.527
- 18 holes!

1:01:55.528 --> 1:01:57.211
Oh, by the way, golf
is canceled tomorrow!

1:01:59.650 --> 1:02:01.383
Nighty night.

1:02:01.385 --> 1:02:06.421
(Chris cackles)
(bells ringing)

1:02:08.125 --> 1:02:09.324
(light music)

1:02:09.326 --> 1:02:11.393
No one can blame you.

1:02:11.395 --> 1:02:13.195
You had to show them.

1:02:13.197 --> 1:02:15.363
You're not their bitch.

1:02:15.365 --> 1:02:17.099
You had to stand up.

1:02:42.126 --> 1:02:43.525
Honey, I'm home.

1:03:00.177 --> 1:03:02.410
(snoring)

1:03:06.917 --> 1:03:08.884
- Unbelievable.

1:03:08.886 --> 1:03:09.751
Chris!

1:03:10.721 --> 1:03:11.586
Chris!

1:03:12.623 --> 1:03:13.555
You're hammered!

1:03:13.557 --> 1:03:15.891
I can smell you from here.

1:03:15.893 --> 1:03:17.125
365 days, huh?

1:03:19.129 --> 1:03:20.695
- It was a good run.

1:03:20.697 --> 1:03:23.331
- Where the fuck
were you last night?

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:24.866
- I went looking for you.

1:03:24.868 --> 1:03:28.904
- [Susan] Are you at least
gonna be Santa for Crissy?

1:03:28.906 --> 1:03:30.472
- Christmas, yeah.

1:03:31.441 --> 1:03:33.341
Yeah, just give me a minute.

1:03:33.343 --> 1:03:35.544
- Where's the suit?

1:03:35.546 --> 1:03:36.545
- Bathroom?

1:04:11.415 --> 1:04:14.316
(pills clattering)

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:26.561
(dramatic music)

1:04:37.608 --> 1:04:40.342
(bells ringing)

1:04:41.845 --> 1:04:43.245
- What the hell?

1:04:47.417 --> 1:04:48.550
- Ho, ho, ho!

1:04:51.188 --> 1:04:55.190
- And shortly after that, he
was seen wandering the streets

1:04:55.192 --> 1:04:58.860
in this suit,
babbling incoherently

1:04:58.862 --> 1:05:02.197
and then he wandered
right into traffic

1:05:03.233 --> 1:05:06.735
and was hit by a pickup
truck, I believe.

1:05:08.138 --> 1:05:12.307
And so he was taken down to
see my friend in the morgue.

1:05:14.811 --> 1:05:17.245
- Yeah, that is a
pretty gruesome story.

1:05:17.247 --> 1:05:18.847
- Mm-hm.

1:05:18.849 --> 1:05:21.750
- Sounds right up
my sister's alley.

1:05:21.752 --> 1:05:24.152
- Then you'll take it?

1:05:24.154 --> 1:05:25.787
- Yeah, I don't know, it
just doesn't have that

1:05:25.789 --> 1:05:28.023
certain special something.

1:05:29.826 --> 1:05:30.725
- Really?

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:33.795
- You know, maybe I
came to the wrong place.

1:05:33.797 --> 1:05:35.530
- Oh, nonsense, you
came to the right place,

1:05:35.532 --> 1:05:37.332
you just haven't found
the right object.

1:05:37.334 --> 1:05:39.200
Come on, let's
just keep looking.

1:05:39.202 --> 1:05:40.502
Perhaps we'll find something.

1:05:40.504 --> 1:05:42.370
I know we'll find something.
- Okay, okay.

1:05:42.372 --> 1:05:43.571
No need to twist my arm.

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:45.473
- Oh, okay, apologies.

1:05:53.016 --> 1:05:57.419
Well, we have a two-headed
pig embryo over there.

1:05:57.421 --> 1:05:59.521
Might be a bit messy.

1:05:59.523 --> 1:06:03.024
We have an antique
syringe kit here.

1:06:03.026 --> 1:06:04.225
Doctor's forceps.

1:06:04.227 --> 1:06:07.295
Down there is a desiccated bat.

1:06:07.297 --> 1:06:08.663
No?

1:06:08.665 --> 1:06:09.564
Well.

1:06:10.734 --> 1:06:12.467
Oh, this might work!

1:06:17.074 --> 1:06:18.206
A sword king.

1:06:19.810 --> 1:06:22.043
- Seems a little dangerous.

1:06:22.045 --> 1:06:23.478
- Oh, no.

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:26.948
Weapons are only dangerous
in the wrong hands.

1:06:29.353 --> 1:06:30.885
- No.

1:06:30.887 --> 1:06:35.290
I'm sorry, I just, nothing
really strikes me as her.

1:06:35.292 --> 1:06:36.358
- All right.

1:06:38.328 --> 1:06:40.395
- What about that skull?

1:06:41.565 --> 1:06:44.165
That strikes me as her.

1:06:44.167 --> 1:06:45.533
- Hmm?

1:06:45.535 --> 1:06:46.801
The skull, no, no,

1:06:46.803 --> 1:06:50.638
you don't want to hear
the story behind that.

1:06:51.475 --> 1:06:52.374
That

1:06:54.678 --> 1:06:56.411
is a beautiful ring.

1:06:57.714 --> 1:06:58.947
- Thank you.

1:06:58.949 --> 1:07:00.315
- [Thaddeus] Where
did you get it?

1:07:00.317 --> 1:07:02.717
- It was my mother's.

1:07:02.719 --> 1:07:05.153
- A family heirloom?

1:07:05.155 --> 1:07:08.723
I swear I've seen one
just like it before.

1:07:11.194 --> 1:07:13.428
(dramatic music)

1:07:13.430 --> 1:07:14.996
- Maybe.

1:07:14.998 --> 1:07:17.232
There aren't many like it.

1:07:19.703 --> 1:07:20.935
The story behind this one

1:07:20.937 --> 1:07:25.140
could put most of the
items in here to shame.

1:07:25.142 --> 1:07:26.041
- Really?

1:07:27.244 --> 1:07:28.910
Color me intrigued.

1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:31.479
Please, do tell.

1:07:32.716 --> 1:07:34.215
- Isn't it getting
a little late?

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:36.184
- Oh, I have all night.

1:07:37.621 --> 1:07:41.556
- Well, my mother left
it to me when she died.

1:07:41.558 --> 1:07:43.091
Ever since I was a little girl,

1:07:43.093 --> 1:07:45.560
she used to tell
me I was a miracle.

1:07:45.562 --> 1:07:47.328
Amelia, a miracle.

1:07:47.330 --> 1:07:48.830
She used to say it all the time

1:07:48.832 --> 1:07:52.634
but she never told me why
until I was much older.

1:07:53.804 --> 1:07:56.604
(dramatic music)

1:08:14.691 --> 1:08:17.492
(dramatic music)

1:08:49.192 --> 1:08:51.526
(knocking)

1:08:59.035 --> 1:09:00.502
- Hm.

1:09:00.504 --> 1:09:01.970
May I help you?

1:09:01.972 --> 1:09:02.837
- [Anna] Ms. Mulvay?

1:09:02.839 --> 1:09:03.738
- Yes?

1:09:05.108 --> 1:09:08.576
- I'm Anna, we spoke on the
phone about the room for rent.

1:09:08.578 --> 1:09:11.746
- Oh, yes, of course,
please come in.

1:09:19.322 --> 1:09:23.191
You must forgive me, I
didn't expect you so early.

1:09:23.193 --> 1:09:25.059
- Yeah, I took an
earlier bus instead.

1:09:25.061 --> 1:09:25.960
- I see.

1:09:27.030 --> 1:09:28.796
May I help you with your bags?

1:09:28.798 --> 1:09:29.697
- Thanks.

1:09:33.003 --> 1:09:35.503
- [Lavinia] Was
your trip pleasant?

1:09:35.505 --> 1:09:38.006
- Pleasant enough.
- Wonderful.

1:09:38.008 --> 1:09:41.242
Well, I suppose you'd
like to see the room.

1:09:41.244 --> 1:09:42.510
- That'd be great.

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:44.012
- Right this way.

1:09:52.322 --> 1:09:55.256
Anna, is that
short for anything?

1:09:55.258 --> 1:09:58.026
- Anastasia, but no
one ever called me that

1:09:58.028 --> 1:10:01.095
except for my mother
and she's dead.

1:10:01.097 --> 1:10:03.464
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:10:03.466 --> 1:10:06.768
My name is Lavinia, but
you can call me Vinny.

1:10:06.770 --> 1:10:08.203
Everyone does.

1:10:08.205 --> 1:10:09.704
- Okay, Vinny.

1:10:09.706 --> 1:10:12.273
- My mother always called
me by my full name too.

1:10:12.275 --> 1:10:15.043
I was named after my
great-grandmother.

1:10:15.045 --> 1:10:18.746
Her daughter built this
place, my grandma Jenny.

1:10:18.748 --> 1:10:19.981
- When was it built?

1:10:19.983 --> 1:10:23.751
- 1908, the first year
her crops prospered.

1:10:23.753 --> 1:10:24.686
- She was a farmer?

1:10:24.688 --> 1:10:26.754
- Oh, yes, my whole family.

1:10:26.756 --> 1:10:28.523
The entire town, really.

1:10:28.525 --> 1:10:31.025
Without our crops,
we'd have nothing.

1:10:31.027 --> 1:10:31.926
- Wow.

1:10:32.963 --> 1:10:34.529
- The room is right
down the hall.

1:10:34.531 --> 1:10:37.232
Nothing fancy, but it's clean

1:10:37.234 --> 1:10:39.934
and it has a lovely
view of the countryside.

1:10:39.936 --> 1:10:41.769
- I'm sure it's fine.

1:10:43.673 --> 1:10:46.241
(door creaks)

1:10:50.347 --> 1:10:51.980
It's perfect.

1:10:51.982 --> 1:10:53.014
- Good.

1:10:53.016 --> 1:10:54.682
And we're very isolated here,

1:10:54.684 --> 1:10:57.685
so you'll have plenty
of peace and quiet.

1:10:57.687 --> 1:10:59.654
Are you a student?

1:10:59.656 --> 1:11:00.888
- No, not yet.

1:11:00.890 --> 1:11:02.490
I'm just looking
for a job right now.

1:11:02.492 --> 1:11:04.092
- I see.
- But don't worry.

1:11:04.094 --> 1:11:05.893
I have some money saved up.

1:11:05.895 --> 1:11:08.429
The ad said that
rent was $50 a month.

1:11:08.431 --> 1:11:10.965
- Let's not worry about
all that just now.

1:11:10.967 --> 1:11:13.635
What about your family, friends?

1:11:14.904 --> 1:11:17.872
- I don't have any
friends around here yet

1:11:17.874 --> 1:11:22.110
and for my family, well,
all I had left was my mother

1:11:22.112 --> 1:11:24.746
and she died a few months ago.

1:11:24.748 --> 1:11:27.448
Left me on my own for
the first time and

1:11:27.450 --> 1:11:32.086
I just wanted to get as far
away from that town as I could.

1:11:32.088 --> 1:11:33.921
So here I am.

1:11:33.923 --> 1:11:36.224
- Oh, I understand.

1:11:36.226 --> 1:11:39.827
Well, Anna, I have a
good feeling about you.

1:11:39.829 --> 1:11:42.997
So, if you like the
room, it's yours.

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:45.733
- Yes, yes, thank you.

1:11:46.670 --> 1:11:47.935
- Not at all.

1:11:47.937 --> 1:11:50.405
Now, why don't I go down
and bring up your bags.

1:11:50.407 --> 1:11:52.173
In the meantime, you
just get settled in

1:11:52.175 --> 1:11:54.742
and make yourself at home.

1:11:54.744 --> 1:11:58.546
Oh, my husband Robert
will be home at six

1:11:58.548 --> 1:12:01.549
if you'd like to
join us for supper.

1:12:01.551 --> 1:12:03.384
- I'd love to.

1:12:03.386 --> 1:12:04.352
- Splendid.

1:12:18.868 --> 1:12:21.703
(dramatic music)

1:12:25.775 --> 1:12:28.843
(dishes clattering)

1:12:35.719 --> 1:12:38.386
- So, Anna, where are you from?

1:12:40.957 --> 1:12:42.357
- New Haven.

1:12:42.359 --> 1:12:43.257
- Oh.

1:12:44.361 --> 1:12:46.427
Got some friends
out in New Haven.

1:12:46.429 --> 1:12:48.896
Spent some time there myself.

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.867
- Yeah, I've spent
enough time there.

1:12:52.869 --> 1:12:55.970
I'm much happier
here, believe me.

1:12:55.972 --> 1:13:00.608
- Looking for a fresh
start in the country, eh?

1:13:00.610 --> 1:13:03.611
- Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

1:13:05.248 --> 1:13:08.549
- Well, we're happy to have ya.

1:13:08.551 --> 1:13:10.385
Aren't we, dear?

1:13:10.387 --> 1:13:12.420
- Yes, we certainly are.

1:13:16.459 --> 1:13:19.394
- Does anyone else live here?

1:13:19.396 --> 1:13:22.697
Like, do you have
any kids or anything?

1:13:26.102 --> 1:13:29.270
- (coughs) We haven't been
blessed with children.

1:13:29.272 --> 1:13:30.171
- Yet.

1:13:34.110 --> 1:13:35.743
- Oh.

1:13:35.745 --> 1:13:36.644
I see.

1:13:38.248 --> 1:13:39.547
- It's just us.

1:13:41.518 --> 1:13:42.417
And you.

1:13:47.123 --> 1:13:49.991
- Would you like some
more salad, dear?

1:13:49.993 --> 1:13:51.459
- Um, yeah, sure.

1:13:55.965 --> 1:13:57.465
I like your ring.

1:13:59.402 --> 1:14:00.968
- Thank you.

1:14:00.970 --> 1:14:03.004
It's very special to me.

1:14:03.006 --> 1:14:04.238
- Why is that?

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:10.445
- Robert, Anna's
looking for a new job.

1:14:10.447 --> 1:14:14.015
Do you know of anyone
in town who's hiring?

1:14:15.785 --> 1:14:19.654
- Come to think of it, Ned
Buckley down at the feed store,

1:14:19.656 --> 1:14:22.924
he had a help wanted sign
in his window the other day.

1:14:22.926 --> 1:14:27.762
May be worth a visit tomorrow
if you want to talk to him.

1:14:29.132 --> 1:14:30.598
- Thanks, I will.

1:14:36.072 --> 1:14:38.473
- I'd like to raise a toast.

1:14:44.481 --> 1:14:45.379
To Anna.

1:14:46.950 --> 1:14:48.916
Our new friend.

1:14:48.918 --> 1:14:50.718
And to happy beginnings.

1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:52.220
- Cheers to that.

1:14:52.989 --> 1:14:53.888
- Cheers.

1:15:42.205 --> 1:15:44.906
(tense music)

1:15:44.908 --> 1:15:47.808
(people chanting)

1:16:18.408 --> 1:16:19.307
- Sorry.

1:16:20.977 --> 1:16:23.911
I didn't mean to startle you.

1:16:23.913 --> 1:16:26.080
I was just coming
to check on you.

1:16:26.082 --> 1:16:28.249
See if you need anything.

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:32.720
- No, I was sleeping.

1:16:33.790 --> 1:16:37.491
I heard these voices
outside and I saw fire.

1:16:38.294 --> 1:16:39.193
- Fire?

1:16:40.897 --> 1:16:43.798
You must have still
been dreaming.

1:16:46.669 --> 1:16:49.971
Ain't no fire out
there that I can see.

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:53.908
- But listen, there's...

1:16:56.112 --> 1:16:58.112
- I don't hear nothin'.

1:16:59.482 --> 1:17:02.383
Maybe you ought
to go back to bed.

1:17:04.387 --> 1:17:07.288
Looks like you
could use the rest.

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.624
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

1:17:13.229 --> 1:17:16.931
- And if you need
anything, anything at all,

1:17:19.569 --> 1:17:20.635
just holler.

1:17:24.974 --> 1:17:27.808
(dramatic music)

1:17:58.341 --> 1:18:01.275
(Anna gasps)

1:18:01.277 --> 1:18:02.943
- Sorry about that.

1:18:31.641 --> 1:18:33.007
Hello?

1:18:33.009 --> 1:18:34.975
- [Ned] Can I help you?

1:18:36.612 --> 1:18:38.546
- Hi, I'm Anna Thompson.

1:18:38.548 --> 1:18:42.550
I just moved into the Mulvay's
house out on Willow Road.

1:18:42.552 --> 1:18:44.118
- Oh, well, hello there.

1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:46.120
Nice to make your
acquaintance, young lady.

1:18:46.122 --> 1:18:48.389
Welcome to our little town.

1:18:48.391 --> 1:18:49.657
- Thanks.

1:18:49.659 --> 1:18:51.058
Doesn't seem many
others around here

1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:53.794
are too happy to see me.

1:18:53.796 --> 1:18:55.296
- Don't mind them.

1:18:55.298 --> 1:18:57.798
They're just not used to
seeing strangers in town.

1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:59.700
What can I do for you?

1:19:01.070 --> 1:19:03.370
- Robert said you might be
looking to hire someone.

1:19:03.372 --> 1:19:04.872
- Yeah, that's right.

1:19:04.874 --> 1:19:07.141
My little girl, Shelley,
she's going off to school soon

1:19:07.143 --> 1:19:09.243
and I'll need someone
to take her place.

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:11.479
Isn't that right, Shelley?

1:19:14.383 --> 1:19:17.785
You got any experience
working in a place like this?

1:19:17.787 --> 1:19:19.920
- No, not really.

1:19:19.922 --> 1:19:22.356
But I'm a fast learner
and a hard worker and

1:19:22.358 --> 1:19:24.892
I'll work whatever
hours you need.

1:19:24.894 --> 1:19:26.393
- I don't know.

1:19:26.395 --> 1:19:28.229
Some of the other girls
the Mulvays sent over here

1:19:28.231 --> 1:19:30.631
didn't work out so well.

1:19:30.633 --> 1:19:32.933
Shelley, what do you think?

1:19:34.570 --> 1:19:35.870
Don't mind her.

1:19:35.872 --> 1:19:38.606
She doesn't speak
much these days.

1:19:38.608 --> 1:19:42.343
Used to talk too much
for her own damn good.

1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:45.012
Tell you what.

1:19:45.014 --> 1:19:47.948
Come in here tomorrow
morning, 7 a.m.,

1:19:47.950 --> 1:19:50.217
we'll try you out,
see how you do.

1:19:50.219 --> 1:19:51.719
- Sure, sounds good.

1:19:51.721 --> 1:19:53.687
- All right then.
- Thanks.

1:19:53.689 --> 1:19:55.689
- I'm Ned, Ned Buckley.

1:20:00.363 --> 1:20:01.595
- Thanks, Ned.

1:20:02.632 --> 1:20:05.299
- I'll see you again real soon.

1:20:06.135 --> 1:20:08.702
- Sure will, bright and early.

1:20:14.577 --> 1:20:19.146
- Shelley, get back here,
girl, we got work to do!

1:20:19.148 --> 1:20:20.548
(dramatic music)

1:20:20.550 --> 1:20:22.883
- Hey, Shelley, what is it?

1:20:24.821 --> 1:20:26.387
You're hurting me.

1:20:32.728 --> 1:20:37.464
- [Ned] Shelley, get back
here, girl, we got work to do.

1:20:39.602 --> 1:20:42.403
(dramatic music)

1:20:51.814 --> 1:20:56.851
(cats screeching)
(thunder rumbling)

1:21:08.030 --> 1:21:12.199
- So, did you enjoy
your first trip to town?

1:21:12.201 --> 1:21:14.702
- Yeah, it's nice down there.

1:21:14.704 --> 1:21:17.037
Kinda quiet, though.

1:21:17.039 --> 1:21:18.172
You know, I was sorta
surprised I didn't see any

1:21:18.174 --> 1:21:21.475
Christmas decorations
or carolers.

1:21:21.477 --> 1:21:23.477
- I'm afraid Christmas
isn't a very big holiday

1:21:23.479 --> 1:21:25.412
around these parts.

1:21:25.414 --> 1:21:26.881
- Guess not.

1:21:26.883 --> 1:21:29.450
But at least I have a job now.

1:21:30.853 --> 1:21:32.887
- Old Ned's a good man.

1:21:32.889 --> 1:21:35.956
I think you'll like
working for him.

1:21:37.693 --> 1:21:40.761
- His daughter
seemed kinda strange.

1:21:42.265 --> 1:21:45.432
- Yes, Shelley, oh,
what a sad story.

1:21:47.403 --> 1:21:51.038
- There was something
wrong with her tongue.

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.707
- Rumor has it she chewed
it right off herself.

1:21:53.709 --> 1:21:55.175
No one knows why.

1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.545
- But that doesn't make sense.

1:21:58.547 --> 1:22:01.148
Why would anyone do that?

1:22:01.150 --> 1:22:05.152
- Well, like you said,
she's a strange girl.

1:22:05.154 --> 1:22:09.857
- Actually, everyone I saw
today seemed kind of strange.

1:22:11.894 --> 1:22:14.595
(sinister music)

1:22:15.531 --> 1:22:17.765
- Are you all right, Anna?

1:22:20.536 --> 1:22:22.503
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

1:22:27.510 --> 1:22:29.843
Maybe I should go lay down.

1:22:45.928 --> 1:22:50.998
(dramatic music)
(wind rustling)

1:23:12.021 --> 1:23:13.587
Stop, let go of me!

1:23:19.729 --> 1:23:20.961
- Hello, Anna.

1:23:23.432 --> 1:23:25.399
- What are you doing?

1:23:25.401 --> 1:23:27.534
What do you want from me?

1:23:28.604 --> 1:23:30.037
- You're going to
help get Robert and I

1:23:30.039 --> 1:23:34.408
something we've always wanted
but never had: a child.

1:23:39.482 --> 1:23:41.548
- Put her on her knees.

1:23:41.550 --> 1:23:42.449
- No!

1:23:46.088 --> 1:23:48.689
- Oh, great goddess of the moon,

1:23:48.691 --> 1:23:53.260
we, your loyal servants, do
call on you on this night.

1:23:54.363 --> 1:23:57.664
This night of the
winter solstice.

1:23:57.666 --> 1:24:00.434
The night where
your light shines

1:24:00.436 --> 1:24:02.870
longer than any other night.

1:24:02.872 --> 1:24:07.474
Where your power is greater
than all other nights.

1:24:07.476 --> 1:24:10.377
We offer you this
life, this soul,

1:24:11.847 --> 1:24:14.648
in exchange for a
life of our own:

1:24:15.951 --> 1:24:19.787
the gift of fertility between
my husband Robert and I

1:24:19.789 --> 1:24:22.956
so that we may have
a child, at last.

1:24:25.027 --> 1:24:27.261
- You provided us with
fertile crops and lands

1:24:27.263 --> 1:24:29.663
so that we may prosper.

1:24:29.665 --> 1:24:32.699
And for that, we are
eternally thankful.

1:24:32.701 --> 1:24:36.370
But on this night, we ask that
you grant us this blessing

1:24:36.372 --> 1:24:39.139
that we have wanted for so long.

1:24:39.141 --> 1:24:42.543
- Please, great goddess,
accept this sacrifice

1:24:42.545 --> 1:24:45.679
as a symbol of our
devotion to you

1:24:45.681 --> 1:24:48.682
so that we may have
the gift of fertility

1:24:48.684 --> 1:24:53.754
and bring another
devoted follower into
your faithful town,

1:24:54.857 --> 1:24:56.490
who will obey your
teachings always

1:24:56.492 --> 1:25:00.160
and never disobey or
speak out against you.

1:25:01.263 --> 1:25:03.163
- The way others have.

1:25:07.803 --> 1:25:11.772
(chanting in foreign language)

1:25:19.348 --> 1:25:21.849
(whimpering)

1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:47.875
- (sobbing) Please, don't.

1:25:49.145 --> 1:25:52.446
I won't tell anyone,
I promise, please.

1:25:56.218 --> 1:25:59.620
- Your life may have
been short, dear child,

1:25:59.622 --> 1:26:04.691
but your purpose was greater
than you could have ever known.

1:26:05.494 --> 1:26:09.129
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:26:12.635 --> 1:26:13.567
- Take her.

1:26:17.039 --> 1:26:22.109
(Anna screaming)
(flesh thudding)

1:26:33.856 --> 1:26:38.759
- Oh, oh, thank you, great
goddess, for this gift of life.

1:26:39.795 --> 1:26:42.362
Our child will make you proud.

1:26:57.213 --> 1:27:00.013
(birds chirping)

1:27:05.221 --> 1:27:10.290
(baby crying)
(dramatic music)

1:27:37.586 --> 1:27:41.388
- And that's the last story
she told me before she died.

1:27:41.390 --> 1:27:43.624
- So the sacrifice worked?

1:27:44.526 --> 1:27:47.327
- I'm standing here, aren't I?

1:27:47.329 --> 1:27:48.795
- Indeed you are.

1:27:49.965 --> 1:27:53.634
You know, your mother was--
- A monster?

1:27:53.636 --> 1:27:57.104
- That's not what
I was going to say.

1:27:57.106 --> 1:28:00.173
I was going to say
a powerful woman.

1:28:01.477 --> 1:28:03.110
- She was powerful.

1:28:04.313 --> 1:28:06.980
But I don't expect you
to believe all that.

1:28:06.982 --> 1:28:08.215
- Don't be so sure.

1:28:08.217 --> 1:28:11.018
Like you, I also
have an open mind.

1:28:13.622 --> 1:28:15.522
- But it's just a story, right?

1:28:15.524 --> 1:28:17.491
Made up by an old
lady on her deathbed.

1:28:17.493 --> 1:28:18.992
- Just a story?

1:28:18.994 --> 1:28:22.095
Stories are the most
powerful things we possess.

1:28:22.097 --> 1:28:25.399
We pass them on from
generation to generation.

1:28:25.401 --> 1:28:28.568
They connect all
races, all people.

1:28:28.570 --> 1:28:30.671
They live longer than we do.

1:28:30.673 --> 1:28:33.106
They transcend death.

1:28:33.108 --> 1:28:34.408
- Yeah, I suppose you're right.

1:28:34.410 --> 1:28:35.575
- I am right.

1:28:37.446 --> 1:28:39.279
Which is why I was...

1:28:42.318 --> 1:28:46.820
I'll have to have that
ring for my collection.

1:28:46.822 --> 1:28:49.122
- I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't part with it.

1:28:49.124 --> 1:28:50.891
- Oh, come on!

1:28:50.893 --> 1:28:52.326
We can barter!

1:28:52.328 --> 1:28:56.063
Anything, anything in
this shop, it's yours.

1:28:57.833 --> 1:29:01.234
- No, really, thank
you, but I couldn't.

1:29:04.907 --> 1:29:05.806
- Truly?

1:29:13.582 --> 1:29:14.481
All right.

1:29:20.656 --> 1:29:21.555
So.

1:29:23.025 --> 1:29:25.092
What'll it be then?

1:29:25.094 --> 1:29:28.628
What will your sister
get for Christmas?

1:29:28.630 --> 1:29:30.764
Oh, it's almost midnight.

1:29:35.070 --> 1:29:38.705
- I'm really sorry, I
just, I can't decide.

1:29:45.881 --> 1:29:47.280
- Wait a minute.

1:29:48.650 --> 1:29:52.319
I just remembered something
that I've kept hidden away

1:29:52.321 --> 1:29:56.089
that I think will be
perfect for your sister.

1:29:56.091 --> 1:29:57.791
- Really?
- On my life!

1:29:57.793 --> 1:29:59.526
Here, I'll show you.

1:30:02.131 --> 1:30:06.333
I really think you'll be
willing to give up that ring

1:30:06.335 --> 1:30:08.135
when I show you this.

1:30:12.007 --> 1:30:14.841
(dramatic music)

1:30:16.879 --> 1:30:19.746
What's, what's,
what's going on here?

1:30:19.748 --> 1:30:21.648
Who are you people?

1:30:21.650 --> 1:30:24.217
Get out of my shop, right now!

1:30:25.053 --> 1:30:27.154
- What were you going to do?

1:30:27.156 --> 1:30:31.124
Kill me for my ring, like
you killed my sister?

1:30:33.429 --> 1:30:35.395
- Your sister?

1:30:35.397 --> 1:30:36.296
- Ophelia.

1:30:37.766 --> 1:30:39.499
My mother had twins.

1:30:40.569 --> 1:30:42.803
- I knew I recognized you.

1:30:52.681 --> 1:30:56.049
- I knew it was her
the moment I saw it.

1:30:57.519 --> 1:30:59.152
And you killed her.

1:31:00.389 --> 1:31:01.321
For a ring.

1:31:02.491 --> 1:31:03.657
Just like all the
others you killed

1:31:03.659 --> 1:31:06.026
for the things in this shop.

1:31:08.597 --> 1:31:13.200
When Sarah bought it, she
brought it to me and I knew.

1:31:13.202 --> 1:31:15.335
I knew what you had done.

1:31:18.540 --> 1:31:20.974
We've been watching you.

1:31:20.976 --> 1:31:25.045
We've seen what you've
down to all these people.

1:31:26.915 --> 1:31:29.583
- You don't understand.

1:31:29.585 --> 1:31:33.286
It is my duty to
collect these items,

1:31:33.288 --> 1:31:35.956
to preserve them any way I can.

1:31:39.027 --> 1:31:43.096
What's one person when a
story can be preserved?

1:31:43.899 --> 1:31:46.132
I did your sister a favor.

1:31:47.402 --> 1:31:49.302
She will live forever.

1:31:51.907 --> 1:31:54.875
(knife clattering)

1:32:04.453 --> 1:32:05.719
- You're right.

1:32:14.897 --> 1:32:16.963
She is going to live on.

1:32:18.033 --> 1:32:20.600
(flesh slicing)
(groaning)

1:32:20.602 --> 1:32:23.169
(blood trickling)

1:32:23.171 --> 1:32:24.738
A little trick my
mother taught me

1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:28.909
for bringing back someone
who was taken too soon.

1:32:29.978 --> 1:32:32.612
We just needed a
little of your blood

1:32:32.614 --> 1:32:35.081
and a belonging of my sister's.

1:32:35.083 --> 1:32:38.118
We were going to
use her ring, but

1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:40.520
her skull is so much better.

1:32:43.892 --> 1:32:48.428
- I should have killed you
the moment you walked in here.

1:32:48.430 --> 1:32:49.329
- Yeah.

1:32:50.299 --> 1:32:51.698
You should have.

1:33:03.645 --> 1:33:06.546
(blood trickling)

1:33:08.750 --> 1:33:12.719
(chanting in foreign language)

1:33:26.234 --> 1:33:27.467
Great goddess.

1:33:28.804 --> 1:33:32.105
Tonight, on the solstice,
we offer you the blood

1:33:32.107 --> 1:33:35.175
of the man who killed Ophelia.

1:33:35.177 --> 1:33:39.112
We, your humble servants,
make you this offering

1:33:39.114 --> 1:33:43.750
that you might bring her back
to us to live once again.

1:33:46.355 --> 1:33:50.323
(chanting in foreign language)

1:34:29.131 --> 1:34:30.764
- Stop it, stop it!

1:34:48.950 --> 1:34:51.284
- Praise be, great goddess!

1:34:55.824 --> 1:34:56.723
Ophelia?

1:34:57.959 --> 1:35:00.927
(Ophelia gurgling)

1:35:12.374 --> 1:35:14.307
You've come back to us.

1:35:30.358 --> 1:35:33.526
Mother said you wouldn't
be quite the same.

1:35:33.528 --> 1:35:36.196
But I love you just as you are.

1:35:45.207 --> 1:35:47.607
And I brought you a present.

1:35:55.217 --> 1:35:56.116
- No.

1:35:57.552 --> 1:36:00.286
(growling)

1:36:00.288 --> 1:36:01.187
No!

1:36:03.325 --> 1:36:08.061
(gasping)
(dramatic music)

1:36:08.063 --> 1:36:10.029
No, no, please, please!

1:36:11.633 --> 1:36:13.900
- Merry Christmas, Ophelia.

1:36:16.238 --> 1:36:19.239
- No, no!
(hissing)

1:36:20.108 --> 1:36:21.007
No, no!

1:36:24.780 --> 1:36:28.314
(flesh gurgling)

1:36:28.316 --> 1:36:30.350
¶ Hear ye, hear ye the
faith of the time ¶

1:36:30.352 --> 1:36:32.352
¶ Don't you know
it's daylight time ¶

1:36:32.354 --> 1:36:36.589
¶ Can't you hear
the noise of light ¶

1:36:36.591 --> 1:36:38.625
¶ Hear those boys and girls ¶

1:36:38.627 --> 1:36:40.360
¶ Listen to that big cow bell ¶

1:36:40.362 --> 1:36:44.430
¶ Everybody's going on a ride ¶

1:36:44.432 --> 1:36:46.332
¶ Hurry up, they hear them cry ¶

1:36:46.334 --> 1:36:48.635
¶ All aboard ¶

1:36:48.637 --> 1:36:52.539
¶ Come on, hear ye for
that old sleigh ride ¶

1:36:52.541 --> 1:36:57.610
¶ Come on, hear ye ¶

1:37:00.448 --> 1:37:04.017
¶ Come on, everybody,
make a lot of noise ¶

1:37:04.019 --> 1:37:08.288
¶ Hear the sleigh bells ring ¶

1:37:08.290 --> 1:37:11.925
¶ Everybody, everybody off ¶

1:37:18.300 --> 1:37:20.033
¶ Now everyone, together ¶

1:37:20.035 --> 1:37:23.269
¶ Everybody's
happy by the tree ¶

1:37:23.271 --> 1:37:27.006
¶ On a good old sleigh ride ¶

1:37:27.843 --> 1:37:30.677
(dramatic music)
