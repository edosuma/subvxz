WEBVTT

00:10.970 --> 00:12.130
Crichton:
Aeryn?

00:12.221 --> 00:13.722
Aeryn:
I'm still here.

00:13.806 --> 00:15.421
But I still can't get to you.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.347
May not matter.

00:18.394 --> 00:20.100
D'Argo's unconscious.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.981
Crichton!!

00:26.068 --> 00:28.775
I've been discovered!
I'm under attack!

00:28.863 --> 00:32.151
I'm reading eight Prowlers,
four Marauders, and there's
more on the way.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.777
And they're all firing at once.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.075
Get off me! Get off!

00:36.162 --> 00:37.618
Aeryn, get the hell
out of there.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.242
I can't! I can't!

00:40.333 --> 00:41.618
No!

00:44.420 --> 00:46.081
Aeryn!

00:46.172 --> 00:48.379
( cracking glass )

00:50.426 --> 00:52.257
Ahhhhh!!!

00:52.345 --> 00:53.676
(gasps )

00:53.763 --> 00:55.128
Damn!

00:55.223 --> 00:58.340
Zhaan, that is where heart
attacks come from.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.390
My circuitry organ does
not seize up.

01:00.478 --> 01:02.139
Mine does.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.970
Oh, I'm sorry, John.

01:04.065 --> 01:07.683
| just can't seem to shake
these visions no matter
how much I meditate.

01:07.777 --> 01:11.520
l'll offer it again: talking
about it could help.

01:13.324 --> 01:14.279
I doubt it.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.949
Suit yourself.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.867
Zhaan:
How long until Moya returns?

01:18.955 --> 01:22.914
Crichton:
Oh, about an am. Oh, crap!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.082
Okay, I found the problem.

01:25.169 --> 01:29.629
Some joker decided to store
his keva barbecue in
the nav-linkage.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.296
Rygel.

01:31.384 --> 01:32.123
You betcha.

01:32.218 --> 01:33.583
Can it be repaired?

01:33.678 --> 01:34.963
It's pretty messed up.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.170
DRD's are gonna have to rip
the whole thing apart.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.630
Then we wait?

01:39.517 --> 01:42.133
Yep. We wait.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.893
(sighs)

01:47.275 --> 01:52.770
( singing )
Sweet dreams ti||
sunbeams find you

01:52.863 --> 01:57.823
Sweet dreams that leave
your worries behind you

01:57.910 --> 02:01.903
But in your dreams,
whatever they be

02:01.998 --> 02:05.957
Dream a little dream of me

02:08.254 --> 02:10.119
I was.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.467
I keep seeing you die.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.550
John...

02:20.641 --> 02:24.133
Have Chiana or Rygel ever
spoken to you about what
occurred on Litigara?

02:24.228 --> 02:25.934
No, not a lot.

02:26.022 --> 02:30.231
Chiana said it was best to
talk to you about it.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.778
After you destroyed the
Gammak Base l was terrified
we'd lost you.

02:34.864 --> 02:38.823
Well, we would have called
but Scorpy was still
in the neighborhood

02:38.909 --> 02:40.365
(dry chuckle)

02:41.412 --> 02:44.529
For 20 solar days...

02:44.623 --> 02:49.242
we searched every planet we
thought you might have reached.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.828
The last world we discovered
was Litigara.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.293
What happened there?

02:59.138 --> 03:02.380
Something you don't want to
talk about. Got it.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.724
(sighs)

03:06.979 --> 03:09.140
Something I don't want
to remember.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.359
Zhaan?

03:15.363 --> 03:18.651
You have to understand, John,
we were all under
incredible stress.

03:18.741 --> 03:22.700
And Moya was anxious to leave
to search for her offspring.

03:22.787 --> 03:24.778
l was growing desperate.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.241
You'd remember them if
you'd seen them.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.122
Wish I could help you.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.669
Listen to me!

03:33.756 --> 03:36.668
A Sebacean, a Luxan, and a hu
and another Sebacean.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.795
We haven't had any
Sebaceans in here ever.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.377
And a Luxan, I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.588
Are you sure?

03:43.682 --> 03:45.263
This is very important.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.059
I'm sure.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.566
(groaning)

04:04.453 --> 04:07.695
Buy you a drink, beautiful?

04:07.790 --> 04:10.372
Getting dren-faced is
not helping, Rygel.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.836
Well it's helping me!

04:14.380 --> 04:15.870
Chiana:
Hey!

04:16.841 --> 04:18.206
Ugh!

04:18.300 --> 04:19.961
(giggles )

04:20.052 --> 04:21.667
What?

04:21.762 --> 04:24.219
Leave me alone!

04:24.306 --> 04:26.297
Get outside, both of you!

04:26.392 --> 04:28.257
Voice on comm.:
Have you found someone yet?

04:28.352 --> 04:30.388
I'm on to it now.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.024
Please observe the signals.

04:38.112 --> 04:41.275
For your own safety, all
traffic is monitored.

04:41.365 --> 04:45.278
Zhaan:
Pilot, tell Moya she must
continue to be patient.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.861
This is the last inhabitable
planet within range of
Aeryn's Prowler.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.242
If Crichton, D'Argo, and Aeryn
managed to get away,

04:51.333 --> 04:53.244
this is the last planet
they could have...

04:53.335 --> 04:58.079
Pilot:
Moya understands, but she
feels she's been patient.

04:58.174 --> 05:02.463
She now demands that you return
to the ship at once.
-Demands?

05:02.553 --> 05:07.092
She believes she has been
more than accommodating
in your search.

05:07.183 --> 05:15.978
Perhaps it is time to accept
that their fate, whatever it
may be, does not include us.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.689
Tell Moya we'll begin the
search for young Talyn
as soon as we return.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.441
You can't be serious!
And what about...

05:27.536 --> 05:29.276
Silence! Both of you!

05:31.999 --> 05:34.661
I've seen the way that you two
have handled your anxiety

05:34.752 --> 05:37.539
over the fate of Aeryn,
Crichton, and D'Argo.

05:37.630 --> 05:43.250
I hate to think of how you're
now going to handle your
grief and your loss.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.801
Attention pedestrian.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.473
Do not cross.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.391
Do not cross.

05:54.188 --> 05:54.893
( Beep )

05:54.980 --> 05:58.188
You may proceed.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.811
(oncoming vehicle)

06:00.277 --> 06:02.563
Zhaan!

06:02.655 --> 06:04.941
Police:
You! Halt! Don't move!
Remain where you are!

06:05.032 --> 06:07.114
Is something the matter?
-On your feet!

06:07.201 --> 06:09.692
Get your frelling
hands off her!
-Back off!

06:09.787 --> 06:11.402
What the yotz do you
think you're doing?
-Shut up!

06:11.497 --> 06:12.782
What did she do?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.955
Your friend's ours now.
She's gonna pay for her crime.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.704
Rygel:
Crime? What crime?

06:23.175 --> 06:24.915
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.377
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.305
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

06:31.392 --> 06:35.135
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.014
Help me.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.390
Listen, please.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.392
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

06:39.483 --> 06:44.022
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.069
I'm doing everything I can.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.738
I'm just looking for
a way home.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.962
(machines beeping)

07:11.056 --> 07:14.719
Chiana:
Pilot, tell Moya she's just
going to have to blez out.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.847
I will try to keep Moya calm.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.226
But you must relate to Zhaan
that Moya is ready to bolt

07:21.317 --> 07:24.935
to look for young Talyn
at any moment.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.402
Zhaan.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.653
You shouldn't have come.
You and Rygel shouldn't
still be here.

07:32.745 --> 07:36.454
Hey, his Royal Frogness may be
back in the Transport Pod
sleeping it off.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.496
But take a look.
I'm here, okay?

07:38.584 --> 07:41.326
I want to help. You even know
what you're charged with?

07:41.420 --> 07:44.332
Failing to heed a pedestrian
signal light.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.287
Who are you?

07:45.382 --> 07:47.464
Name's Dersch, Maton Dersch.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.416
And you are?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.672
No need to tell me. Uh...

07:52.348 --> 07:54.088
Zotoh Zhaan.

07:54.475 --> 07:55.510
The off-worlder.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.932
What are you?

07:57.019 --> 07:58.884
I'm a public counselor.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.719
Specifically, her
public counselor.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.020
What are you, relative?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.222
Friend.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.103
Whatever. Let me run this
down for you.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.105
This your first time on our
planet? Doesn't matter.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.938
( beeping )
Dersch. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on.

08:10.032 --> 08:13.024
Failing to heed, it's garbage.
Plus, you're an off-worlder.
Didn't know the laws.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.110
Good judge in a good mood,
I'd say expect the
minimum sentence.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.787
Ten solar days and you're
on your way home.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.411
No. No. We can't stay
here ten solar days.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.242
Okay, talk to me.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.251
All right Zhaan, look...

08:30.594 --> 08:32.255
Maybe we should get a
different lawyer.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.928
Well, you're welcome to try.
There's plenty of them around.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.098
90% of our population
are lawyers.

08:39.561 --> 08:40.721
Case comes up tomorrow.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.395
Tomorrow?
-|'|| see you then.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.522
I need you to listen.
-What?

08:46.610 --> 08:48.646
I need you to listen to me.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.318
Come on, speak up.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.317
(yelling)

08:52.408 --> 08:53.864
Chiana:
Zhaan!

08:53.951 --> 08:56.158
Stop it! Let go!

08:56.245 --> 08:58.281
Please!
-Release him now!

08:58.372 --> 08:59.282
No!

09:02.918 --> 09:04.033
( electrical crackling )

09:05.254 --> 09:06.334
Is she down?
-She's down.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.413
Get back, everybody!
Secure cell five.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.247
Clear out! Clear out!

09:10.342 --> 09:11.548
Everybody stay back!

09:11.635 --> 09:13.250
Dersch:
I'm okay.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.223
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.010
Chiana...

09:28.277 --> 09:30.939
Everything is ready to go.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.065
We proceed as planned.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.864
Man on speaker:
But, Rhumann, you know it's
dangerous for me to be on the streets tonight.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.988
Your personal problems
mean nothing to me.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.411
You'll be there tonight.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.329
We've found the
perfect subject.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.702
( speaker device beeps )

09:46.795 --> 09:49.172
(electrical chirping )

09:52.342 --> 09:54.549
You've done well.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.178
(metal doors opening
and closing )

10:33.467 --> 10:35.549
(gasps )

10:35.636 --> 10:38.252
Crichton:
Well, look who's here.
You need a lift, lady?

10:38.347 --> 10:40.338
(chuckling):
You're alive.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.467
It wasn't easy.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.264
We've got quite a
story to tell.

10:43.352 --> 10:47.470
Later. Now we're going to
get you out of here and
get off this rock.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.600
We've been looking for
you everywhere.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.353
Hoping, praying.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.106
The last 15 solar days have
been unbearable.

10:55.197 --> 10:59.190
Hasn't exactly been a trip to
Disneyland for us either.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.616
At least you're finally here.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.614
( laughs )

11:09.086 --> 11:11.293
What are you waiting for?

11:11.380 --> 11:12.586
Fire.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.499
You're here to rescue me.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.049
(sighs)

11:20.347 --> 11:22.258
(voice breaking ):
Come on.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.307
I need you here to rescue me.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.308
(doors opening and closing)

11:31.942 --> 11:33.978
( crying )

11:45.330 --> 11:46.831
Get away from me.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.655
Get away.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.213
( softly):
Oh, I wish you were really here.

12:00.387 --> 12:04.175
I need you so badly.

12:04.266 --> 12:09.135
The chances that we survived,
that you'd find us, were
ten million to one.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.221
You knew that the moment
you Starburst away.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.358
You're just refusing
to accept it.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.066
But now you must.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.649
All this time, since we escaped
from the Peacekeepers,

12:23.744 --> 12:27.202
I drew my strength from
you and the others.

12:27.289 --> 12:33.410
Now I've got myself
incarcerated again,
without you to help me.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.252
Oh, John...

12:39.217 --> 12:43.256
lam so deeply alone.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.758
And afraid.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.306
You're not alone.

12:48.393 --> 12:52.227
You have Rygel, and Chiana.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.351
They're like children.

12:55.442 --> 13:00.687
How can I be responsible for
them, and for Pilot, and for
Moya, and for myself?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.817
Not without you.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.442
But it must be without us now.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.908
(whimpers )

13:21.426 --> 13:23.917
( crying )

13:29.434 --> 13:32.050
Rough night, hmm?

13:33.021 --> 13:35.137
You want to escape?

13:35.691 --> 13:37.852
This is your chance.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.354
( high-pitched beeping )

13:48.537 --> 13:50.744
This will show you how to get
out of the building.

13:50.831 --> 13:53.197
How to get back to where
your pod is docked.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.082
Why are you doing this?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.501
You want out, or you
want answers?

13:58.588 --> 14:03.127
The guards will be back at
their posts any microt.

14:03.218 --> 14:07.302
A second chance to escape,
it isn't going to happen.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.145
(engines buzzing)

14:27.993 --> 14:30.450
(metal clanging )

14:37.335 --> 14:38.245
Chiana!
-Uh?

14:38.336 --> 14:40.497
Rygel!
-Zhaan?

14:40.589 --> 14:41.169
Hmm?

14:41.256 --> 14:43.087
(panting)

14:43.550 --> 14:45.711
Aah...

14:45.802 --> 14:48.054
Police:
Stand where you are!

14:48.889 --> 14:50.254
(gasping)

14:50.766 --> 14:52.097
Halt!

14:52.184 --> 14:53.549
(guards yelling)

14:53.643 --> 14:55.099
Stop it!

14:55.187 --> 14:56.427
Police:
Release him now!

14:56.897 --> 14:58.478
(yelling)

15:00.275 --> 15:02.516
Police:
Release him!

15:02.611 --> 15:04.317
( electrical crackling )
Get back!

15:05.489 --> 15:07.070
(groaning)

15:12.913 --> 15:15.746
You're under arrest, alien.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.663
For murder.

15:23.882 --> 15:27.591
Well, the good news is you're
no longer facing trial on the
traffic violation.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.222
You have any idea who it was
you murdered last night?

15:34.309 --> 15:36.721
ldidn't murder anyone.
I was set up.

15:36.812 --> 15:39.849
His name was Wesli Kenn,
if you care.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.148
He was a rising young Equal
Rights Advocate for
the Utilities.

15:43.235 --> 15:44.850
Utilities... what?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.685
The ten percent who
aren't lawyers?

15:49.074 --> 15:51.110
Case against you is you
busted out of here

15:51.201 --> 15:53.192
and as you were fleeing,
you came across Kenn,

15:53.286 --> 15:58.246
panicked and crushed his neck
with your bare hands.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.244
Now, I can't say people are
too broken up about it.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.827
Had some radical ideas about
The Law. Sweeping reforms
for the Utilities.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.128
Bit of a troublemaker, really.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.625
Well, what are you going
to do for her?

16:06.716 --> 16:09.423
Well, there's not much
I can do.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.843
As far as the law is concerned,
it's a done deal.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.512
Three solar days from now,

16:14.599 --> 16:17.591
she's executed.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.678
Chiana:
Well, you got to defend her.
She didn't do it.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.433
What's her defense?

16:24.067 --> 16:25.682
It's just her word.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.154
Chiana:
You're a lawyer. You know,
make something up.

16:28.238 --> 16:32.197
Do you know what would
happen to me if I put on
a bad faith defense?

16:32.284 --> 16:33.694
You might win?

16:33.785 --> 16:37.448
Dersch:
I put on a defense I even
suspect of being false,

16:37.539 --> 16:41.077
and I suffer the same
punishment as my client.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.001
I'll see you in court.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.392
Rygel:
This is a very
ass-backwards world.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.394
They don't have monarchs,
political parties.

17:07.485 --> 17:10.101
They have ruling law firms.

17:10.197 --> 17:15.408
The law firm currently in power
is Rhumann, Willian...
something.

17:15.493 --> 17:21.989
Anyway, Ja Rhumann, their
senior partner, the man in
charge, is him up there.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.620
Chiana:
Well, can't you get to him?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.248
He's these people's
supreme leader.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.545
He's never alone.

17:28.632 --> 17:30.338
You want to tell me how?

17:32.844 --> 17:35.335
(gavel pounding)

17:37.432 --> 17:42.347
We convene in the name of
that which is most holy,

17:42.437 --> 17:45.179
the Supreme Law of the Land.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.435
Quite.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.021
Amet.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.229
Amet.
HI I ICL.

17:53.323 --> 17:57.441
The off-worlder is aware of the
charges for which she has been
brought before this court?

17:57.535 --> 17:59.867
She is, Your Honor.

17:59.955 --> 18:05.700
Judge:
Having examined the evidence
and eyewitness accounts of the events of evening last

18:05.794 --> 18:10.504
and after weighing all such
admissions, this court...

18:10.590 --> 18:12.967
Does it not matter that
I am innocent?

18:16.346 --> 18:20.089
Are you entering a plea
of Not Guilty?

18:20.183 --> 18:24.096
lam guilty of so many evils
Your... Your Honor, but...

18:24.187 --> 18:28.180
of this infraction, I must
protest my innocence.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.687
Have you discussed this
with your attorney?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.358
No, she has not.

18:32.445 --> 18:38.406
Mr. Dersch, do you wish to
represent your client in
a plea of Not Guilty?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.825
Absolutely no, Your Honor.

18:40.912 --> 18:44.905
I'm afraid, Mistress Zhaan
without concurrence with
your counsel

18:45.000 --> 18:47.241
I cannot enter such a plea.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.997
Unless...

18:50.088 --> 18:54.548
there is someone else who would
be willing to advocate the
defendant's cause?

18:56.928 --> 19:02.673
Without a volunteer, | see no
other course than to proceed.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.768
I hereby find the defendant

19:06.855 --> 19:08.641
guilty as charged.
-Wait!

19:08.732 --> 19:10.347
l, uh...

19:13.361 --> 19:14.316
Do proceed.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.190
This is pure dren!

19:16.281 --> 19:19.114
You're about to condemn an
innocent woman to death.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.576
I will not permit this.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.991
What are you doing, Chiana?

19:22.078 --> 19:23.818
I will not have you trapped
here with me.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.529
Return to Moya immediately.

19:33.006 --> 19:37.090
Our offer stands, Your Honor.

19:39.429 --> 19:43.172
You are now counsel
for the defense.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.490
All those are law books?

20:06.581 --> 20:09.448
This is only the peak
of the mountain.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.707
I doubt we'll really need them.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.164
Well, you could at least
say thank you.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.839
For what?

20:18.927 --> 20:22.260
Assuring your own executions in
two solar days along with mine?

20:22.347 --> 20:24.429
What's this?

20:24.516 --> 20:27.599
If we put on a defense that
includes falsehoods or, uh...

20:27.685 --> 20:30.301
or can in any way be
construed as bad faith

20:30.397 --> 20:32.763
then we share the same
punishment as our client.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.267
You never told me that.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.020
How could you never
tell me that?

20:36.111 --> 20:38.397
I thought we might even
pull this off!

20:38.488 --> 20:42.276
But you and me? Not lying?
Are you mad?

20:42.367 --> 20:43.322
Guard!

20:43.410 --> 20:44.991
I demand to see the Judge!

20:45.078 --> 20:46.943
Rygel, it's done.

20:47.038 --> 20:51.372
The way it lays out now is
either we're all leaving
this planet together,

20:53.670 --> 20:56.082
or none of us are.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.087
This is ridiculous.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.009
We aren't lawyers.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.212
We are now.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.137
Shut up and read.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.715
Watch it!

21:08.810 --> 21:11.096
You clumsy fool.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.096
Damned Utilities.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.523
Doesn't deserve any frelling
rights at all.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.441
You guys get a lot of that?

21:19.529 --> 21:21.110
He's a lawyer, it's his right.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.983
They have rights.

21:23.074 --> 21:27.238
That's why Wesli Kenn and the
reforms he was advocating,

21:27.328 --> 21:29.239
meant so much to my comrades.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.622
And me.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.457
My friend didn't do it.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.294
But can you prove it?

21:38.381 --> 21:40.337
Under our law?

21:40.425 --> 21:41.835
Damn it.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.042
Why's your system got to be
so frelling complicated?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.297
It wasn't.

21:45.388 --> 21:48.095
It's only grown complicated
over the centuries.

21:48.183 --> 21:52.096
Rygel:
You mean to say your laws
weren't always such a mess?

21:52.187 --> 21:53.723
This book,

21:53.813 --> 21:57.556
The Axiom, is the basis
for all our law.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.518
All of these other books
exist merely to expand on
what's in here.

22:02.447 --> 22:06.406
How did that become this?

22:06.493 --> 22:10.202
As more and more of our people
devoted themselves to The Law,

22:10.288 --> 22:14.281
The Law had to grow more
complex to justify them all.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.244
This is the only book
you really need.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.058
Zhaan:
Please don't do this to me.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.010
ldon't wish you...

22:37.106 --> 22:39.142
you're not really here.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.146
You're just a figment
of my imagination.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.353
Why'd you leave us, Zhaan?

22:49.285 --> 22:51.537
I didn't leave you.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.078
A few more microts and we all
could have been aboard Moya.

22:54.165 --> 22:57.828
We all could've Starburst
to safety together.

22:57.919 --> 23:01.127
You told me to go.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.752
If Moya had been captured,
we would have all perished.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.842
I came back for you.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.216
I've been searching.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.388
Where are you?

23:24.529 --> 23:26.190
Where...

23:26.948 --> 23:29.064
where are you?

23:35.290 --> 23:37.906
Zhaan:
This must not go on.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.367
Zhaan, what are you doing?

23:40.461 --> 23:43.203
This trial must not be
allowed to continue.

23:44.799 --> 23:45.879
I confess.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.207
Zhaan!
-Are you insane?

23:47.302 --> 23:50.044
I am guilty.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.003
I committed that murder.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.259
(gavel pounding)

23:54.350 --> 23:57.262
I crushed that man's throat.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.896
You admit that you are guilty?

24:01.983 --> 24:03.393
Zhaan...

24:04.235 --> 24:06.942
Zhaan, don't do this.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.270
What's the matter with you?

24:08.364 --> 24:10.150
You want to die?

24:11.409 --> 24:14.116
I do not want you and Rygel
to die with me.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.787
I refuse to carry the guilt
of any more deaths into
the afterlife.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.455
We haven't lied yet.

24:19.542 --> 24:22.033
Of course, the trial's only
been on for a few microts.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.084
Rygel!
-You will.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.630
In light of a full confession
on the part of the
defendant, I...

24:27.717 --> 24:31.801
Wait.
Yesterday you refused my
client's Not Guilty plea

24:31.888 --> 24:34.345
until her attorney had
concurred with it.

24:34.432 --> 24:38.345
Well, we do not concur with our
client's confession of guilt.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.142
Do not listen to them,
Your Honor.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.094
I do not want their counsel.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.306
I crushed that man's throat.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.651
I am guilty.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.475
Chiana:
Gag her.
Your Honour, I insist

24:47.570 --> 24:49.526
that you gag my client
for her own good.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.104
You can't do this!

24:51.199 --> 24:54.111
Execute me, but let those live.

24:54.202 --> 24:56.614
They don't know what
they're doing!

25:02.502 --> 25:06.245
This trial will proceed.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.172
And I would put the time
of death at

25:14.263 --> 25:19.178
sometime between the tenth
and eleventh arns of two
evenings past.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.977
The cause of death,
strangulation.

25:23.064 --> 25:27.182
You're supposed to be some sort
of expert in your field?

25:27.276 --> 25:32.646
I am considered to be
Litigara's preeminent expert
in forensic science, yes.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.733
I don't understand how you can
call yourself an expert

25:36.828 --> 25:39.535
when we know for a fact
that the time of death

25:39.622 --> 25:42.113
couldn't be when you said,
because”.

25:42.208 --> 25:46.201
You cannot lie.

25:46.295 --> 25:51.130
Rygel:
Actually, my question goes
to the cause of death.

25:51.217 --> 25:55.176
Would it shock you to know that
we have experts of our own

25:55.263 --> 25:57.470
who are prepared to testify
that when...

25:57.557 --> 25:59.013
Uh...

26:03.271 --> 26:07.264
No questions, Your Honor.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.308
I was on duty two nights ago.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.611
The accused definitely looked
desperate to get out and
join her friends.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.108
Rygel:
Object...

26:16.868 --> 26:19.701
Okay, so, uh...

26:19.787 --> 26:22.119
so, you were the guard
on duty that night?

26:22.206 --> 26:25.118
One of them, yes.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.996
How'd my client manage
to slip past you?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.952
Any idea?

26:30.047 --> 26:32.663
It was while we were changing
shifts. There's a short
period of time

26:32.759 --> 26:35.671
(farting and grunting)
where that particular cell
block isn't fully attended.

26:35.762 --> 26:39.050
( high-pitched voice ):
But even with that, don't you
think somebody would like...

26:43.519 --> 26:47.137
(Rygel groaning)

26:50.193 --> 26:51.558
You little toad!

26:51.652 --> 26:53.688
You had to go and fart
helium now?

26:53.780 --> 26:56.192
( high-pitched voice ):
I'm nervous. It happens.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.115
We're in court, so sue me.

27:02.246 --> 27:06.080
I was on duty at the station
when numerous telemissions
came in

27:06.167 --> 27:11.287
from citizens, about a
suspicious looking off-worlder
running down back alleys.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.837
I mobilized some men and
proceeded to a spot

27:13.925 --> 27:18.089
where we hoped to intercept the
offender for questioning.

27:18.179 --> 27:22.923
When we got there,
we found the accused,

27:23.017 --> 27:26.430
kneeling over the body
of her victim.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.941
Chiana:
Pilot, we need more time.

27:34.028 --> 27:38.237
Pilot:
Moya will give you one more
revolution of this planet.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.155
Then she is leaving.

27:40.243 --> 27:45.078
And I cannot promise we
will ever come back.

27:45.164 --> 27:50.704
This time tomorrow night,
either we've... we've
got Zhaan or...

27:50.795 --> 27:53.878
or Rygel and I will be headed
back to the Transport Pod
without her.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.168
Chiana:
Look at him.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.630
That's the frelling cop
who arrested Zhaan.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.056
He'll probably get a
promotion out of this.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.805
What the yozk is wrong
with his face?

28:08.896 --> 28:10.432
He has blue eyes.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.560
So? My second wife
had blue eyes.

28:13.651 --> 28:16.438
15th and 23rd wives, too.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.394
There was a dual full moon
the other night.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.275
Chiana:
Really?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.324
Litigarans with blue eyes
usually stay inside.

28:23.411 --> 28:24.776
That's what burned his face.

28:24.871 --> 28:27.078
They have an aversion to it.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.873
So, he's not only a bastard,
he's stupid.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.167
Well, I don't think
he's stupid.

28:33.254 --> 28:35.336
I think he knows a lot.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.004
What are you going to do?

28:37.091 --> 28:38.706
Nothing to worry about,
padnen

28:38.801 --> 28:41.008
Just doing what I do best.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.256
Making a new friend.

28:45.224 --> 28:49.388
I'm going to end up
defending them both.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.225
You want something?

28:55.276 --> 29:00.316
I just hate to see you sitting
there, all by yourself.

29:00.406 --> 29:04.024
Oh, listen honey, if you think
I'm going to help you
with your case...

29:04.118 --> 29:06.200
The case is over.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.245
Isn't that obvious after today?

29:09.332 --> 29:11.448
We're pleading guilty
tomorrow, anyway.

29:11.542 --> 29:16.662
Besides, you've already
testified.

29:16.756 --> 29:21.295
I've been reading about a
strange concept in this
Axiom of yours.

29:21.385 --> 29:25.128
Hmm, the Light of Truth.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.758
Pretty interesting, isn't it?

29:26.849 --> 29:28.134
It is.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.352
Some sort of stick that you
people used to think

29:30.436 --> 29:32.768
told if somebody was telling
the truth or not.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.187
It goes back to the
origin of The Law.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.687
It was believed that if you held
a burning torch up to someone
who was giving testimony

29:38.778 --> 29:40.814
and it burnt brighter, it meant
that they were lying.

29:40.905 --> 29:43.487
I don't need to prove
somebody's lying.

29:43.574 --> 29:47.362
I need something that'll let
me lie, just a little.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.037
(Chiana giggles)
No. So tell me all about...

29:51.123 --> 29:54.160
tell me all about being a
police officer.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.412
Blue-eyed, red-faced sack of...

29:59.090 --> 30:01.172
Oh!

30:01.258 --> 30:02.714
( muttering )

30:03.928 --> 30:06.294
Mmm, there. This is him.

30:06.389 --> 30:09.222
The guy that was
murdered, right?

30:10.393 --> 30:11.974
There...

30:18.401 --> 30:20.266
Wesli Kenn.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.313
(tapping)

30:22.405 --> 30:24.817
Rygel:
Let's go, Chiana. Up, up, up.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.488
Court's just about
to reconvene.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.282
Zhaan's off visiting
some happy place.

30:29.370 --> 30:32.328
And I need you awake.

30:32.415 --> 30:35.282
I told you everything
the cop told me.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.580
My head's just fine here.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.504
Nobody'll notice.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.251
Nashtin Cleansing Pills.

30:43.342 --> 30:50.680
Take one now, one at the
mid-meal and one if you
need it, tonight.

30:50.766 --> 30:54.224
Judge:
We convene in the name of that
which is most holy.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.973
The Supreme Law of the Land.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.476
Yes, Your Honour. Yes, I have
questions for the witness.
Yes, I do.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.400
Oh, I definitely do.
Oh, I definitely, definitely do.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.102
Did I say I did? Because I do.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.984
You testified yesterday that
Mistress Zhaan, the defendant,
Mistress Zhaan,

31:08.075 --> 31:09.736
Mistress Zotoh Zhaan, the woman
standing right there.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.318
Right there. Do you see her?
Because I see her.
Do you see her, hmm?

31:12.413 --> 31:14.278
She escaped during your shift.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.288
Is that correct?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.125
Is it?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.621
Yes, ma'am, that's...
-Correct.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.169
And that you also stated that
she escaped on your very short

31:22.256 --> 31:24.963
very small, very minimal
interval in which you
and your guards

31:25.051 --> 31:29.465
or you and your guard buddies
where switching shifts, or
changing shifts,

31:29.555 --> 31:32.342
taking a leak, someone going
on, someone going off.

31:32.433 --> 31:33.297
Okay, so if I were to...

31:33.392 --> 31:34.928
( Rygel clearing throat)

31:35.019 --> 31:39.388
Your Honor, may I have a word
with my co-counsel?

31:39.482 --> 31:41.723
Please do.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.273
(giggling)

31:44.612 --> 31:47.319
You took all three of the
pills, didn't you?

31:47.406 --> 31:51.775
Oh, you have... you have no
idea how frelled off I felt.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.485
No idea.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.868
Was there anything unusual
about that night?

31:57.958 --> 31:59.619
The night of the murder?

31:59.710 --> 32:00.995
Unusual?

32:01.087 --> 32:04.796
Having to do with
your two moons.

32:04.882 --> 32:07.840
Oh, yes, yes.
Now I see what you mean.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.294
There was a dual full moon
that night, as I recall.

32:11.388 --> 32:16.724
And as I understand it, certain
Litigarans, specifically those
with blue eyes

32:16.811 --> 32:20.303
are very careful not to go
out on such nights.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.355
The burn they get is
very painful.

32:24.735 --> 32:27.852
Oh, your complexion.

32:29.532 --> 32:32.490
It looks like you got yourself
quite a burn there.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.988
I got it the night
of the arrest.

32:35.079 --> 32:38.162
Yeah, you've got blue eyes.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.374
You were out that night
and so was the victim.

32:42.461 --> 32:46.124
Only you got burned,
and he didn't.

32:46.215 --> 32:48.581
You became a city police
officer how long ago?

32:48.676 --> 32:52.134
Oh, no, no. That's right.
You told me last night.

32:52.221 --> 32:56.385
You'd been in the force what,
eight, almost nine cycles?

32:56.475 --> 33:00.138
And before that, you said you
worked in the private sector.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.685
Is that right?

33:02.523 --> 33:05.185
As a security officer?

33:05.276 --> 33:06.766
Am I right?

33:06.861 --> 33:11.696
For the law firm of Rhumann,
Willian and Mandall,
is that right?

33:11.782 --> 33:14.990
The law firm of Ja Rhumann?

33:17.329 --> 33:19.160
Come on, Pilot.
You got to tell Moya to wait.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.988
It'll do no good.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.291
She's charging her calorics
right now, preparing
to break orbit.

33:24.378 --> 33:27.791
I'm heading back to the
Transport Pod. I want to talk
to her so she can see my face.

33:27.882 --> 33:29.418
She won't listen to you,
Chiana.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.339
She isn't even listening to me.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.292
You got to do this for me.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.342
For Zhaan.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.920
There's nothing I can do.

33:36.015 --> 33:38.006
Moya is leaving.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.681
( cries out )

33:42.521 --> 33:43.852
(Chiana grunts)

33:43.939 --> 33:46.055
(force field humming)

33:47.234 --> 33:48.189
Pilot?

33:49.486 --> 33:51.317
Pilot!

33:58.412 --> 34:00.323
Welcome, counselor.

34:00.414 --> 34:05.579
I am Ja Rhumann, senior
partner in the currently
governing firm.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.045
A law firm?

34:07.129 --> 34:09.586
Is it part of your law to
electrinet somebody

34:09.673 --> 34:11.789
and drag them to your office in
the middle of the night?

34:11.884 --> 34:14.341
I was impressed with your
showing today.

34:14.428 --> 34:17.135
With little understanding of
our very complex legal system

34:17.223 --> 34:21.762
you managed to kindle doubt
about your shipmate's guilt.

34:21.852 --> 34:25.936
It's not a lawyer's way to
be long-winded, so let's get
right to the point.

34:26.023 --> 34:27.809
You will not win this case.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.859
You will lose, and your client
will be executed.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.186
Frell you.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.771
This is no longer about
Zotoh Zhaan.

34:35.866 --> 34:38.278
It's about you and
the Hynerian.

34:38.369 --> 34:41.327
You will not call
any more witnesses.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.155
You will not pursue the line of
questioning you began today.

34:44.250 --> 34:48.118
If you do, you and the little
slug will find yourselves
up on charges.

34:48.212 --> 34:49.702
False charges.

34:49.797 --> 34:53.164
That will nevertheless keep you
locked up here in Litigara

34:53.259 --> 34:55.170
for the rest of your lives.

34:55.261 --> 35:00.130
You see, this is all about
Utilities' rights, my dear.

35:00.224 --> 35:03.091
Utilities don't need
any more rights.

35:03.185 --> 35:06.268
They need to work harder.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.812
But that's my concern.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.855
Your concern is your own life,

35:10.943 --> 35:13.480
and where you're going to
spend the rest of it.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.950
You won't be needing your
communications device.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.654
You won't be returning to your
ship unless I allow it.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.158
You have my offer.

35:26.250 --> 35:29.242
You do your part tomorrow
and I'll do mine.

35:29.336 --> 35:30.997
Trust me.

35:31.088 --> 35:32.828
I'm a lawyer.

35:36.510 --> 35:40.298
D'Argo:
Seem to have gotten yourself
into quite a fix without me.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.840
Sweet D'Argo.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.722
This is not the first time
you've had to endure a
cell like this.

35:49.481 --> 35:55.647
This is not the first time
you've had to experience the
sense of hopelessness.

35:55.738 --> 35:58.730
You survived it then.
In fact, you flourished.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.949
I had the Delvian Seek.

36:03.037 --> 36:06.325
My spiritual quest was the
only thing that stopped
myself from shattering

36:06.415 --> 36:08.576
while imprisoned by the
Peacekeepers.

36:09.918 --> 36:13.285
But I have set aside the Seek,

36:13.380 --> 36:15.917
set aside my place as
a Delvian Pa'u.

36:16.008 --> 36:19.296
You set them aside, yes, but
you haven't abandoned them.

36:20.804 --> 36:22.214
Zhaan...

36:23.682 --> 36:27.095
Crichton, Aeryn and I, we...

36:27.186 --> 36:30.144
we can't help you anymore.

36:30.230 --> 36:34.599
Whether you survive this
ordeal or face your
execution tomorrow,

36:34.693 --> 36:38.231
from now on, you must confront
your demons alone.

36:41.450 --> 36:45.363
I don't know if I have the
strength to start again, D'Argo.

36:48.248 --> 36:54.244
I have known thousands of
warriors on countless worlds.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.587
But you,

36:57.674 --> 36:59.710
Zotoh Zhaan,

37:01.178 --> 37:04.636
you are the strongest
individual

37:04.723 --> 37:06.930
I have ever known.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.689
(chanting in Delvian)

37:31.208 --> 37:33.290
Rygel:
Where the yozk have you been?

37:33.377 --> 37:34.742
How is she?

37:34.837 --> 37:36.452
Worse, if you can believe it.

37:36.547 --> 37:41.007
She won't respond at all now,
and she's begun this
incessant mumbling.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.176
Let me have your comms.
I've got to call Pilot.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.595
You were supposed to have
talked to Moya already.

37:46.682 --> 37:49.048
I got grabbed and taken
by Ja Rhumann.

37:49.143 --> 37:51.304
Rhumann? The Rhumann?

37:51.395 --> 37:52.225
Pilot?

37:52.312 --> 37:54.098
( static )

37:56.400 --> 37:58.186
Pilot?

37:58.277 --> 37:59.983
Are you still there?

38:00.070 --> 38:02.937
( static continues )

38:03.031 --> 38:05.283
I am here, Chiana.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.359
Moya has chosen to give you
a little more time.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.322
Thank you, Pilot.

38:13.417 --> 38:16.625
Do not thank me.
It's entirely her doing.

38:16.712 --> 38:21.172
Your comms were open all the
while you were speaking
with that man,

38:21.258 --> 38:23.374
that Ja Rhumann.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.919
She could not leave
you like that.

38:27.014 --> 38:29.300
Moya wants to know.
I want to know.

38:29.391 --> 38:33.054
If you stay, will you be
able to save Zhaan?

38:38.275 --> 38:41.392
I think I may have a way.

38:41.487 --> 38:47.858
It's chancy and will require
Iashings of deception
and trickery.

38:51.413 --> 38:56.157
Finally, you and I get to
play to our strengths.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.956
Judge:
Have you any further
witnesses to call?

39:01.715 --> 39:04.127
Only one, Your Honor.

39:04.218 --> 39:07.836
I call... Ja Rhumann.

39:07.930 --> 39:11.764
Judge:
Do you vow to speak what is
true, all that is true

39:11.850 --> 39:15.434
and only what is true,
by the sacred Axiom?

39:15.521 --> 39:17.978
I so vow.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.020
Mr. Rhumann.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.267
Rhumann:
Yes, counselor?

39:20.359 --> 39:21.849
Let's start with that
oath you just took.

39:21.944 --> 39:23.684
It's pretty important,
isn't it?

39:23.779 --> 39:27.442
So important that you take it
with your hand on this most
sacred book?

39:27.533 --> 39:31.196
It's the most sacred oath
a Litigaran can take.

39:31.286 --> 39:35.154
Chiana:
So lying in court
is really bad?

39:35.249 --> 39:37.456
To lie before The Law
is unthinkable.

39:37.543 --> 39:43.288
Rygel:
So, Mr. Rhumann, remembering
that you are under this most sacred oath,

39:43.382 --> 39:45.543
if I were to ask you what you
know about the death

39:45.634 --> 39:51.174
of the slain Utilities Rights
Advocate, your response
would be?

39:51.265 --> 39:56.259
That I know no more about the
unfortunate and untimely death

39:56.353 --> 39:58.935
than any other ordinary
citizen.

39:59.022 --> 40:01.183
Namely, that your
client did it.

40:05.237 --> 40:06.647
Counselor!

40:09.157 --> 40:10.567
You know what this is?

40:10.659 --> 40:11.899
A stick of wood.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.485
Chiana:
Well, anywhere else, yeah.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.322
But in this courtroom it can
be used as an instrument

40:17.416 --> 40:20.499
for dividing fact from fiction.

40:20.586 --> 40:25.080
The defense designates this
the Light of Truth.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.300
Rhumann:
The Light of Truth
is a parable.

40:27.384 --> 40:28.965
Rygel:
A parable?

40:29.052 --> 40:33.295
But it says it's so in your
own ancient text.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.097
Your Honor, it's ordinary wood.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.345
Chiana:
Well, Light of Truth is
only ordinary wood.

40:38.437 --> 40:41.474
Only when it is near a
witness under oath...

40:41.565 --> 40:45.274
does it react with
special properties.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.477
Proceed.

40:48.572 --> 40:53.692
But I warn you, do not
mock our law.

41:04.921 --> 41:08.163
Chiana:
We just got a couple more
questions for you.

41:08.258 --> 41:09.759
I have nothing to hide.

41:09.843 --> 41:13.335
The death of the Utilities
Rights Advocate.

41:13.430 --> 41:17.639
That benefited your own firm
greatly, did it not?

41:17.726 --> 41:21.093
Rhumann:
It weakened our chief
opponents, yes.

41:21.188 --> 41:26.182
But it doesn't necessarily
follow that my firm had
anything to do with it.

41:26.276 --> 41:29.359
Chiana:
So, if you wanted this guy
out of the way, waiting for an off-worlder

41:29.446 --> 41:32.563
to blame it on would make a lot
of sense to you, wouldn't it?

41:32.658 --> 41:34.694
Speaking hypothetically, yes.

41:34.785 --> 41:36.446
Rygel:
The night of the murder,

41:36.536 --> 41:41.200
the officer who arrested our
client and who used to
work for your law firm

41:41.291 --> 41:44.499
got a bad moon burn,
but the victim didn't.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.874
Chiana:
Well, could that be because
the victim was murdered someplace else,

41:47.964 --> 41:50.455
and his body brought to
the alley by the people
who killed him

41:50.550 --> 41:52.211
knowing that our client
would be there?

41:52.302 --> 41:54.964
Again, speaking hypothetically,

41:55.055 --> 41:57.512
I'd have to say, yes.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.339
Are you speaking
hypothetically?

41:59.434 --> 42:00.844
(whispering ):
Now, Pilot.

42:00.936 --> 42:03.052
Yes, of course I'm speaking
hypothetically.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.977
(whirring )

42:13.156 --> 42:14.692
The night of the murder,

42:14.783 --> 42:17.490
did you send somebody to
our client's cell to
help her escape?

42:17.577 --> 42:19.113
Rhumann:
No.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.786
Did you arrange for the police
to discover our client
with the victim,

42:21.873 --> 42:24.034
the already dead victim
in the alley?

42:24.126 --> 42:26.333
No.

42:26.420 --> 42:29.127
Chiana:
Did you plan and order the
murder that our client

42:29.214 --> 42:31.170
now sits accused of
in this court?

42:31.258 --> 42:32.668
Rhumann:
No! No, no!

42:32.759 --> 42:33.839
Maximizing.

42:33.927 --> 42:36.339
(whirring )

42:48.275 --> 42:52.188
Rygel:
Your Honor, are you going to
believe the protestations

42:52.279 --> 42:54.611
of an obviously, guilty man

42:54.698 --> 43:00.364
or the very symbol of your law,
your world, your truth?

43:07.794 --> 43:10.581
Judge:
Arrest Ja Rhumann.

43:11.673 --> 43:16.292
All charges against
Zotoh Zhaan are dropped.

43:16.386 --> 43:19.674
The prisoner is free to go.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.886
So, they nailed Rhumann
for murder?

43:23.977 --> 43:27.060
I'm not certain.
I know I was exonerated.

43:27.147 --> 43:30.514
Then we left immediately,
and soon found you.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.474
But, you still have nightmares.

43:32.569 --> 43:38.155
Yes. I keep seeing you and
D'Argo and Aeryn dying
horrible deaths.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.448
I can't seem to purge the fear.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.446
I live, Zhaan.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.949
Touch as proof.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.077
I know, but...

43:48.168 --> 43:51.376
The experience proves to me
that my spirituality
was lacking.

43:51.463 --> 43:54.125
Is that why you recommitted
yourself to the Delvian Seek?

43:54.216 --> 43:55.205
Mm-hmm.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.585
Then maybe it was worth it.

43:56.676 --> 43:59.759
Even though my studies fail to
benefit the rest of them?

43:59.846 --> 44:01.382
Now, who says that?

44:01.473 --> 44:04.931
Well, at various times Rygel,
D'Argo, and Aeryn.

44:05.018 --> 44:07.179
Screw 'em, Zhaany.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.385
You're a tenth level Pa'u.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.892
You get to eleven, we get
a TV ministry.

44:12.943 --> 44:15.059
If I may be honest, John.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.145
Most of the time I have no idea
what you're saying.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.104
Neither do I.

44:19.199 --> 44:21.235
Rygel:
Crichton, Zhaan, are you there?

44:21.326 --> 44:24.193
Sparky! We're drifting dead.

44:24.287 --> 44:27.700
How could you possibly frell up
with a frell-proof
transport pod?!

44:27.791 --> 44:29.406
I don't know. I thought maybe
you could tell me.

44:29.501 --> 44:34.495
Something to do with a stash
of keva barbecue in the
nav-Iinkage?!

44:34.589 --> 44:36.250
Oh, come on, Crichton.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.798
What would you really
expect from Rygel?

44:38.885 --> 44:40.841
Nothing. Aeryn, it's good
to hear your voice.

44:40.929 --> 44:43.045
Likewise. We have you on
Moya's senses.

44:43.139 --> 44:45.130
Estimate your retrieval in
a quarter arn.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.840
Can't wait to see you.

44:50.230 --> 44:51.686
You okay?

44:54.317 --> 44:56.148
I think so.

44:58.530 --> 45:00.942
Thank you for your compassion.

45:01.825 --> 45:03.907
And I thank you for yours.
