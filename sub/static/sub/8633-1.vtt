03:07.680 --> 03:11.127
December, 1944.

03:11.296 --> 03:15.125
British and American armies
were on the threshold of victory.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.330
Stretched across half of Europe,
the Allies gathered themselves...

03:18.497 --> 03:21.213
...for the final assault on Germany.

03:21.377 --> 03:23.711
To the north
stood Montgomery's Eighth Army...

03:23.872 --> 03:26.238
...to the south, Patton's Third.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.986
In the center, along an 88-mile front...

03:29.153 --> 03:34.172
...a few battle-weary American divisions
rested in a quiet sector.

03:34.721 --> 03:38.267
To them, the war seemed already won.

03:38.497 --> 03:41.116
This is their story.

03:41.281 --> 03:43.289
We've been flying over these woods
all week.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.400
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.

03:45.569 --> 03:49.050
- Getting hungry, Joe?
- The war is over.

03:49.218 --> 03:52.447
I hear GHQ is cutting orders
to ship us home for Christmas.

03:52.610 --> 03:55.458
The German army still has
6 million men carrying arms.

03:55.617 --> 03:58.367
I haven't heard they're going home
for Christmas.

04:00.514 --> 04:02.750
Hey, there it is...

04:03.362 --> 04:05.567
...the German army.

04:06.755 --> 04:08.893
Let's go down and have a look.

04:14.049 --> 04:17.279
- Buzz him again. I wanna get a picture.
- Okay.

05:17.733 --> 05:20.766
This time, gun your engine.
Make him look up.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.367
It worked.

05:42.822 --> 05:44.895
Swing around.
I wanna get another one.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.262
Conrad.

06:25.192 --> 06:27.297
I am ashamed of you.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.095
Get up.

06:33.449 --> 06:35.816
They could have killed us, sir.

06:35.977 --> 06:38.694
If you'd taken the pains
to have looked carefully...

06:38.858 --> 06:42.502
...you would have observed it was
an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

06:42.665 --> 06:46.691
You would stay in the car if it were
a fighter plane shooting at us.

06:47.082 --> 06:50.430
I did not lose a war to die
in the back seat of a car.

06:50.633 --> 06:54.495
Does the colonel think any of us
has a choice where we will die?

06:54.665 --> 06:59.041
I know where you'll die, Conrad,
at home, in your own bed.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.177
Is the colonel trying to get rid of me?

07:02.634 --> 07:07.653
I think that the world is going
to get rid of both of us.

07:08.521 --> 07:11.042
Pick up your cap! Put it on.

07:11.210 --> 07:13.698
Try to look like a soldier!

07:14.538 --> 07:16.773
What good is a soldier anyhow?

07:16.939 --> 07:19.077
He wins, he loses.

07:19.242 --> 07:21.631
What's he good for anyhow?

07:21.835 --> 07:24.322
Conrad, I've told you before...

07:24.490 --> 07:27.338
...never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.

07:27.499 --> 07:28.807
I'm sorry, sir.

07:28.971 --> 07:30.978
It won't happen again.

07:46.027 --> 07:50.184
Looks like something on the ground
at 10 o'clock. Let's take a look.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.587
Nothing.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.658
Let's go home.

09:00.175 --> 09:02.248
Herr Oberst Hessler is here.

09:45.359 --> 09:47.564
- Colonel Hessler, sir.
- Yes.

09:49.617 --> 09:51.689
Well, Hessler.

09:52.273 --> 09:54.062
It has been a long time.

09:54.225 --> 09:56.461
How good it is to see you again.

09:56.913 --> 09:58.768
You look the same.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.041
Little...

10:00.241 --> 10:01.485
Little leaner perhaps.

10:02.673 --> 10:06.350
The Russian front does not put meat
on a man's bones, general.

10:06.514 --> 10:10.092
Ah, yes. War is hard on all of us.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.263
- Central heating.
- Yeah.

10:13.426 --> 10:15.847
Crystal chandeliers.

10:16.305 --> 10:18.030
You have a nice cellar.

10:18.194 --> 10:20.780
Field Marshal Göring
gave me that painting.

10:20.946 --> 10:23.051
Lovely, isn't it?

10:27.153 --> 10:30.951
I imagine he found a bargain
in Paris last year.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.775
My corporal's waiting.
He's had a hard drive.

10:33.938 --> 10:37.768
Do you suppose there's somewhere
in these ruins he can find a bed?

10:38.547 --> 10:40.335
Sit down, Hessler.

10:41.939 --> 10:46.249
You have too little faith
in the genius of the German people.

10:46.995 --> 10:49.745
A few stones
have been knocked down...

10:49.908 --> 10:53.802
...but our country's strong,
united, determined...

10:54.068 --> 10:55.976
...and more productive than ever.

10:56.148 --> 11:01.330
The Allies think that their constant
air raids have undermined our morale.

11:01.555 --> 11:04.589
- This they'll never do.
- Why have you sent for me, general?

11:06.101 --> 11:10.356
You are our finest
panzer commander, Hessler.

11:10.581 --> 11:12.141
You will lead us to victory.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.700
Our Germany is now like an iceberg.

11:15.315 --> 11:19.026
Only a fraction of it
can be seen on the surface.

11:20.276 --> 11:22.764
Let me show you some of the results...

11:22.932 --> 11:26.162
...of what Germany
has produced underground.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.265
You will discover a new Germany...

11:29.429 --> 11:32.942
...and will take a new pride
in being a German.

11:33.461 --> 11:35.403
Our latest airplane.

11:35.573 --> 11:36.947
A jet.

11:37.109 --> 11:39.979
It flies at more than 900 kilometers
per hour.

11:40.149 --> 11:43.248
Within six months,
we will have enough jet fighters...

11:43.445 --> 11:46.741
...to shoot down every
Allied plane in the air.

11:47.222 --> 11:51.084
Our V-1 rocket destroyed
20 percent of London.

11:51.254 --> 11:55.477
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.

11:57.237 --> 12:00.849
The new 70-ton King Tiger tank.

12:02.102 --> 12:05.168
It has two-and-a-half times
the firepower...

12:05.334 --> 12:09.393
...and double the armor
of the American tanks.

12:09.943 --> 12:13.325
Our Germany is far
from finished, Hessler.

12:13.974 --> 12:18.284
It's a very beautiful model, general.

12:18.903 --> 12:23.474
It proves that the Germans
are still the world's best toy makers.

12:23.638 --> 12:29.171
The toys we are making these days
are not for children.

12:30.295 --> 12:32.499
Let me show them to you.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.993
Hands up! Get on over.

12:55.161 --> 12:59.055
Hold it! Put them up! Stand against
the wall. Put them up, general.

13:00.025 --> 13:01.432
Well, boys...

13:01.593 --> 13:04.211
...looks like we've caught ourselves
a couple of big fish.

13:04.377 --> 13:08.632
- One nice, fat Kraut trout.
- That's enough, now.

13:11.641 --> 13:15.024
Sorry, general.
We are just rehearsing a commando raid.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.600
Very good.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.183
Not bad, Hessler, huh?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.561
Had you fooled, didn't they?

13:21.721 --> 13:23.510
Completely.

13:23.674 --> 13:26.575
Unfortunately,
I am beyond playing games.

13:26.746 --> 13:28.950
Oh, this is no game.

13:29.113 --> 13:32.114
These are German soldiers, all of them.

13:32.281 --> 13:34.900
Trained German soldiers.

13:35.066 --> 13:40.052
Diepel commands the panzer grenadiers
attached to the 1 st Tank Brigade.

13:40.218 --> 13:43.316
These men will work with him.

13:43.482 --> 13:46.516
Major Diepel, kindly explain
Operation Transit to the colonel.

13:46.682 --> 13:50.294
The soldiers will be parachuted
behind the American lines.

13:50.459 --> 13:54.234
Their mission:
To disrupt enemy communications.

13:54.395 --> 13:56.916
We have organized many such teams.

13:57.083 --> 14:02.037
Each will be led by a man who has
actually lived in America.

14:02.203 --> 14:05.171
Schumacher here lived
in Texas for 12 years...

14:05.339 --> 14:07.827
...before returning to the fatherland.

14:08.508 --> 14:11.672
Tell me, lieutenant,
who is your favorite baseball player?

14:11.836 --> 14:14.105
- Lou Gehrig.
- Because he's hit the most home runs?

14:14.268 --> 14:18.393
No, sir. Babe Ruth hit
the most home runs, 60 in 1927.

14:18.556 --> 14:21.273
And what's your opinion
of Adolf Hitler?

14:23.868 --> 14:26.935
As an American, my opinion
would be offensive to these gentlemen.

14:27.133 --> 14:31.388
Come, lieutenant. As an American officer,
you care nothing for German opinion.

14:34.557 --> 14:37.721
Adolf Hitler is a crazy,
Austrian housepainter.

14:37.884 --> 14:42.140
He's a madman who thinks he knows
more than the whole general's staff.

14:42.301 --> 14:45.302
And he's leading Germany
to complete, total destruction.

14:46.108 --> 14:48.923
Perhaps you are going too far.

14:49.501 --> 14:54.072
To carry off this great deception,
even their reflexes must be American.

14:55.677 --> 14:59.475
Your reflexes are to be congratulated,
lieutenant.

15:04.126 --> 15:06.014
Insolent man.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.796
Let him have his fun now.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.674
If he is captured,
he will be shot as a spy.

15:18.014 --> 15:21.561
You must admit, we are very thorough.

15:27.807 --> 15:31.352
Even a pass won't get you through here.

16:08.993 --> 16:12.790
We will attack
through the Losheim Gap.

16:12.962 --> 16:15.165
It's defended only by a single battalion.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.671
The American division
on the Schnee Eifel will be cut off.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.426
Then the Our River Bridge
will be in our hands.

16:23.393 --> 16:26.743
From there, on to Ambléve,
with its road network.

16:26.912 --> 16:31.255
In four days, we will be across
the River Meuse.

16:31.554 --> 16:33.921
The strategic objective?

16:34.082 --> 16:35.543
Antwerp.

16:36.450 --> 16:40.160
By taking Antwerp, we split
the enemy forces in two.

16:40.577 --> 16:44.059
It will take them 18 months to recover.

16:44.643 --> 16:48.538
By then, we will have air superiority
with our jet engines.

16:48.737 --> 16:51.901
And we will have even more
significant weapons.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.709
Weapons which can destroy
an entire city with a single blast.

16:56.707 --> 16:59.674
You have forgotten
one important detail, general.

16:59.843 --> 17:03.737
With their present control of the air,
the Allies will smash our tanks...

17:03.906 --> 17:06.460
...machine-gun our troops,
bomb the bridges...

17:06.627 --> 17:09.244
...and cut our communications.

17:09.410 --> 17:14.080
Suppose I tell you there will be
no Allied planes.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.661
Another secret weapon?

17:18.531 --> 17:20.507
From Spitzbergen, Norway...

17:20.675 --> 17:23.522
...the northernmost weather station
in the world.

17:23.684 --> 17:26.718
We have been waiting two months
for this report.

17:27.332 --> 17:31.041
"A low-pressure area over northern
Europe, starting December 16th.

17:31.204 --> 17:34.947
Low clouds and fog
which will ground all aircraft. "

17:35.716 --> 17:38.400
- How long?
- Long enough...

17:38.564 --> 17:40.931
...if we keep strictly to our timetable.

17:43.205 --> 17:45.147
Unusual clock, isn't it?

17:45.892 --> 17:47.747
It has only one cycle.

17:47.908 --> 17:49.218
Fifty hours.

17:50.244 --> 17:54.271
We have the resources
for 50 hours, full-scale attack.

17:55.973 --> 18:00.064
Maps, clocks, toys.

18:01.317 --> 18:03.226
But with what will I fight?

18:04.294 --> 18:06.049
Colonel Hessler...

18:06.214 --> 18:09.312
...I'm putting you in command
of our armored spearhead.

18:48.551 --> 18:50.723
It can be done.

19:20.777 --> 19:22.565
This came in from SHAEF.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.868
I got a Christmas cake
from home today.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.066
- Think I'll still be here to eat it?
- Send this right through.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.950
Develop this. Bring me the prints
as soon as they come out.

19:31.113 --> 19:32.542
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, Kiley.

19:32.712 --> 19:35.080
Find any Germans under
your bed this morning?

19:35.241 --> 19:39.267
Marching around under there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.318
That's an order.

19:41.480 --> 19:46.303
I want every item on that menu delivered
to every soldier in the division...

19:46.473 --> 19:48.863
...especially those
in the forward positions.

19:49.033 --> 19:52.230
And I want them delivered
in time for Christmas dinner.

19:53.898 --> 19:56.516
Counterintelligence picked
this up from an enemy agent.

19:56.682 --> 19:58.569
Dated November 29th.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.663
"From Field Marshal Keitel. Most secret.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.796
Officers and men who speak English
are wanted for special mission.

20:05.962 --> 20:09.607
Volunteers will report
to General Kohler's headquarters. "

20:09.770 --> 20:12.356
- What do you make of it?
- You know my opinion.

20:12.522 --> 20:15.043
This is one more confirmation.
They're going to attack.

20:15.244 --> 20:17.545
Oh, come on, Kiley, not that again.

20:17.739 --> 20:21.962
They're probably preparing a fifth column
to drop behind our lines.

20:22.283 --> 20:24.672
Were you
in the State Department too, Kiley?

20:24.843 --> 20:27.746
I thought your experience
was limited to police work.

20:29.099 --> 20:33.256
Having been an inspector of police
doesn't disqualify me from thinking.

20:33.419 --> 20:35.176
All cops aren't flatfoots.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.159
Your limited military experience...

20:37.323 --> 20:40.673
...doesn't inspire confidence
in your conclusions. If you think-

20:40.844 --> 20:43.691
Why do you keep saying
they're mounting an offensive?

20:45.516 --> 20:48.549
I spent 20 years before the war
asking questions.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.432
Ever since D-day,
you've had me doing the same thing...

20:51.628 --> 20:53.799
...interrogating prisoners.

20:53.965 --> 20:56.004
I can only report what I've learned.

20:56.172 --> 21:00.035
The German soldier facing us
is still an undefeated enemy.

21:00.205 --> 21:02.245
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.

21:02.413 --> 21:04.355
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.

21:05.581 --> 21:08.002
I have 10 other officers in my section.

21:08.173 --> 21:12.297
We see the same information,
get the same facts as you, Kiley.

21:12.461 --> 21:16.390
All of us come up with one answer, you
come up with the complete opposite.

21:16.588 --> 21:19.272
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
you'd better lie down.

21:19.468 --> 21:21.771
Colonel Pritchard,
you may be my superior officer-

21:21.966 --> 21:23.722
He is.

21:24.494 --> 21:26.697
Excuse me.
Here are the prints you wanted.

21:26.862 --> 21:28.236
Thank you.

21:32.462 --> 21:33.956
Look what showed up on this one.

21:34.575 --> 21:36.517
I took it over the Ardennes.

21:40.526 --> 21:42.982
Is this a Tiger tank, or isn't it?

21:44.206 --> 21:45.930
So it appears.

21:46.095 --> 21:48.135
One tiger doesn't make a jungle, sir.

21:48.655 --> 21:52.397
I expect tigers in jungles. When I discover
one in a peaceful neighborhood...

21:52.591 --> 21:55.755
...I recommend all of us
take a good look under our beds.

21:55.951 --> 21:57.609
Excuse me, sir.

22:07.119 --> 22:08.941
Step outside.

22:23.248 --> 22:25.353
With your permission, sir.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.416
This is from headquarters, Kiley.
Top-secret.

22:31.057 --> 22:34.603
The Third Army has been ordered
to attack the Germans in the Saar.

22:34.769 --> 22:37.933
General Patton is launching
the offensive in two days.

22:38.096 --> 22:39.525
Does it seem possible...

22:39.697 --> 22:43.177
...headquarters would commit an entire
army to an offensive in the south...

22:43.345 --> 22:46.922
...if there were any possibility of the
Germans attacking in the Ardennes?

22:49.458 --> 22:52.807
With all due respect to headquarters,
they could be wrong.

22:54.161 --> 22:55.917
Send this to headquarters anyway.

22:56.082 --> 22:58.153
There seem to be new features
on that tank.

22:58.353 --> 22:59.597
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

22:59.794 --> 23:02.380
Yes, sir. I'd like a rundown
on this German officer.

23:04.626 --> 23:07.211
- All right, send this along.
- Yes, sir.

23:08.659 --> 23:11.561
Get up to the line and tell them
to grab some new prisoners.

23:11.731 --> 23:14.764
- I'm interested in any fresh information.
- Yes, sir.

23:14.929 --> 23:18.246
One thing more. What are
you doing in a reconnaissance plane?

23:18.418 --> 23:21.136
We're not paying you
to be a combat soldier.

23:21.298 --> 23:24.201
- Trying to shorten the war by yourself?
- No, sir.

23:24.371 --> 23:29.160
Just wanna make sure I can enjoy
that nice Christmas dinner you ordered.

23:39.924 --> 23:42.957
I see the colonel's
in fine appetite again.

23:43.123 --> 23:44.716
I am.

23:45.395 --> 23:47.436
Join me in a glass of wine.

23:47.604 --> 23:49.295
Thank you, sir.

23:50.228 --> 23:53.011
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

24:03.573 --> 24:05.361
Conrad.

24:07.061 --> 24:08.555
Speak.

24:09.396 --> 24:12.047
What does the colonel wish me to say?

24:12.213 --> 24:14.319
Speak your mind, the truth.

24:15.381 --> 24:19.537
Don't be afraid, Conrad. I must have
someone to tell me the truth.

24:22.837 --> 24:28.238
I've always been fortunate
to serve under brilliant men...

24:29.366 --> 24:30.642
...who know everything.

24:30.805 --> 24:33.620
From them, I've learned one thing:

24:33.781 --> 24:38.899
When all was lost,
these brilliant men never lost hope.

24:40.055 --> 24:41.615
I admire that.

24:42.998 --> 24:46.227
What else do you admire
about these men?

24:46.742 --> 24:48.367
The illusion.

24:48.854 --> 24:53.645
Maybe I'm not using
the right word, colonel.

24:53.815 --> 24:56.302
I'm not an educated man.

24:56.694 --> 25:00.371
The hope that there is
always one more chance.

25:01.111 --> 25:03.631
That is the illusion.

25:06.232 --> 25:08.435
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.

25:09.815 --> 25:12.499
It's not my place
to speak of such things.

25:13.144 --> 25:14.966
Go on.

25:16.824 --> 25:19.092
I order you to.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.585
Colonel...

25:22.646 --> 25:27.666
...this new command is an illusion.

25:28.024 --> 25:30.129
Give it up.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.440
I am Martin Hessler.

25:35.737 --> 25:38.802
Four years ago,
my panzers overran Poland in one week.

25:38.968 --> 25:41.008
That was no illusion.

25:41.177 --> 25:44.854
In 39 days, my tanks smashed all
the way to Paris. That was no illusion.

25:45.049 --> 25:47.896
I conquered the Crimea.
That was no illusion.

25:50.073 --> 25:51.599
Today...

25:51.769 --> 25:55.031
...I was given a brigade of Tiger tanks.

25:55.192 --> 25:57.943
When I have a brigade of tanks...

25:58.105 --> 25:59.566
...that is reality.

26:02.265 --> 26:03.859
And who will drive your tanks?

26:04.025 --> 26:06.873
The men you led were soldiers.
Veteran soldiers.

26:07.034 --> 26:08.790
Are there any left?

26:08.953 --> 26:10.776
What will they give you now?

26:10.937 --> 26:13.207
I was by your side
in Poland, France, Crimea.

26:13.369 --> 26:15.279
Look at me, colonel,
I'm not the same man.

26:15.450 --> 26:19.280
I jumped in a ditch today at the sight
of an unarmed reconnaissance plane.

26:19.482 --> 26:21.904
My two boys remember me
as a good soldier.

26:22.075 --> 26:23.700
They wouldn't believe it.

26:23.866 --> 26:27.346
But, colonel, I am not the only one.

26:27.515 --> 26:31.988
How sure can you be of the men
who will drive your tanks?

26:41.627 --> 26:42.904
Major Diepel?

26:46.460 --> 26:48.314
- Diepel.
- Yep.

26:49.147 --> 26:52.661
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assembled at once.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.919
Conrad, my boots.

27:12.188 --> 27:14.194
Your commanders, sir.

27:27.932 --> 27:31.031
Boys. Too many boys.

27:31.709 --> 27:34.612
The first battle will turn them into men.

27:34.781 --> 27:37.051
In the old days,
I lived six months with my men...

27:37.245 --> 27:41.140
...before going into action. I knew them,
they knew me. These are strangers.

27:41.310 --> 27:42.739
Too many boys.

27:42.909 --> 27:44.634
They have never tasted defeat.

27:44.797 --> 27:47.448
Do they know what is expected of them?

27:48.093 --> 27:50.614
They are ready to die for you.

27:51.198 --> 27:53.270
Can you ask more?

29:38.562 --> 29:39.905
Sing.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.297
Louder.

31:12.166 --> 31:13.278
Hold it. Hold it.

31:13.479 --> 31:15.584
Hold it. Hold it.

31:17.605 --> 31:19.875
Pull up. We got brass on our tail.
Take it-

31:20.038 --> 31:21.927
Pull it forward, you idiot!

31:22.311 --> 31:25.028
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!

31:29.638 --> 31:31.582
Just a little bit. Hold it.

31:31.783 --> 31:33.376
Hold it! Hold it!

31:33.543 --> 31:35.452
You're dropping my merchandise!

31:35.623 --> 31:37.695
Barrel and Eddie,
come on out of there.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.904
Come on, Cortland.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.487
Disaster.

31:45.319 --> 31:49.094
Solid. Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.

31:49.288 --> 31:51.809
- Complain to my union.
- Yeah, go ahead, tie it up.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.049
- We near enemy territory yet?
- Too near.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.125
- Give me a cigarette.
- I don't smoke.

31:56.296 --> 31:58.270
Sarge, when will we see
some Germans?

31:58.439 --> 31:59.815
- Barrel?
- Smoke your own.

31:59.976 --> 32:01.252
Got a cigarette, Eddie?

32:01.416 --> 32:03.621
- You kidding?
- You cheapskates.

32:03.785 --> 32:06.338
Reach into my bag,
get me a carton of cigarettes.

32:06.504 --> 32:08.261
What's with you and the Germans?

32:08.424 --> 32:10.432
Nothing. I just ain't never seen one.

32:10.601 --> 32:12.990
You know, I've never
even seen a German plane.

32:13.161 --> 32:15.550
Sarge, when are we
gonna get in the action?

32:15.721 --> 32:18.143
What are you, some kind of a nut?

32:18.312 --> 32:20.768
What kind of replacements
they sending us, huh?

32:21.577 --> 32:23.584
"I wanna see action. "

32:23.754 --> 32:26.307
- What's this?
- Put that back. That's merchandise.

32:26.473 --> 32:28.863
Don't tell me there's women
where we're going.

32:29.033 --> 32:32.579
- Who are you gonna give these to?
- Guffy don't give nothing.

32:32.777 --> 32:35.265
- He's peddling them.
- You keep tying it up.

32:35.435 --> 32:37.888
- Peddling them? To who?
- The boys in the front.

32:38.058 --> 32:41.802
They're gonna need that in Germany.
There's lots of broads there.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.544
- French perfume.
- Champagne.

32:45.706 --> 32:48.903
That's gonna bring me 30 bills a bottle
where we're going.

32:49.066 --> 32:52.362
Because there's nothing,
nothing too good for our boys.

32:52.522 --> 32:55.391
- Yeah. What's in here?
- That's the mail.

32:55.562 --> 32:58.530
Are you gonna charge them
something for that too?

33:00.331 --> 33:04.128
- No, they wouldn't sit still for that.
- Just kidding, sarge. Just kidding.

33:04.299 --> 33:06.917
No. When you get these thoughts,
tell me anyway...

33:07.083 --> 33:10.312
...because one thing I'm not
going back home again is poor.

33:10.475 --> 33:12.745
Keep thinking, kid. Very nice.

33:33.229 --> 33:34.985
Germans?

33:40.365 --> 33:42.852
This is the up-front front.

33:53.356 --> 33:55.015
Wide awake bunch of boys.

33:55.180 --> 33:59.304
- Don't you people ever post a sentry?
- I'm sorry, sir. I came in for a second.

33:59.469 --> 34:01.739
What's the matter?
Close the pneumonia hole.

34:01.901 --> 34:04.389
- What were you born in, a barn?
- Oh, sorry, sir.

34:04.558 --> 34:06.500
We didn't know it was you.

34:08.364 --> 34:10.786
- Major Wolenski?
- He's over there, sir.

34:14.958 --> 34:19.235
Hello, colonel. I wasn't expecting a visit
or I'd have had my men smarten up.

34:19.406 --> 34:21.478
How are you?
Hot coffee for the colonel.

34:21.646 --> 34:23.556
Come over and get warm.

34:24.078 --> 34:26.150
You run a pretty loose outfit here.

34:26.318 --> 34:30.824
That radio's been yakking between
Christmas carols we're all going home.

34:30.991 --> 34:32.746
Here, sit down.

34:33.103 --> 34:36.070
It's tough keeping discipline
when the only action...

34:36.239 --> 34:38.312
...is sitting on your butt
to keep warm.

34:38.478 --> 34:39.907
What are the Germans doing?

34:40.079 --> 34:42.664
Same damn thing,
except they don't have any heat.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.067
They gotta exercise
to keep from freezing.

34:45.232 --> 34:48.264
Well, I got a little exercise
for your boys.

34:48.431 --> 34:51.398
I wanna patrol tonight,
try to pick up some prisoners.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.813
Well, there they are.

35:03.695 --> 35:07.011
- Hey, sarge, put those blankets back.
- Come on, shut the window.

35:07.184 --> 35:09.094
What do you wanna
do that for, sarge?

35:09.263 --> 35:12.612
They're out of range. They'll
shoot back with something heavier.

35:12.817 --> 35:16.777
It's you or them, dogface.
I need practice.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.568
That's enough, sergeant.

35:19.729 --> 35:22.828
If you wanna play with that popgun,
you can go outside.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.816
What do you say I take the men out
for a field drill, lieutenant?

35:29.009 --> 35:32.424
In this weather? What for?

35:32.593 --> 35:35.494
Because they're drilling, that's why.

35:35.665 --> 35:38.961
I'll let you know
when I want a drill, sergeant.

35:39.122 --> 35:41.969
Yes, sir, lieutenant.

35:45.041 --> 35:47.310
I'll take that sergeant.

35:47.475 --> 35:51.500
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.

35:52.401 --> 35:54.289
Here you are, colonel.

35:55.282 --> 35:58.795
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?

35:58.963 --> 36:00.750
Just sweeten it.

36:32.019 --> 36:34.353
You are Colonel Hessler?

36:34.516 --> 36:35.945
Who are you?

36:36.116 --> 36:38.505
How did you get in here?

36:38.677 --> 36:42.867
General Kohler's signature is magic.

36:43.061 --> 36:44.883
You will excuse us, major.

36:45.044 --> 36:47.794
Before you give orders,
may I ask your rank?

36:47.957 --> 36:50.323
Courtesan, first class.

36:50.485 --> 36:52.939
Compliments of General Kohler.

36:53.140 --> 36:56.621
I think we have covered
everything, colonel.

37:01.653 --> 37:05.363
General Kohler did not tell me
you were so handsome.

37:05.525 --> 37:08.874
What did General Kohler
tell you about me?

37:09.046 --> 37:11.021
Nothing.

37:12.406 --> 37:14.861
Whatever I want to know...

37:15.414 --> 37:18.764
...I'll find out for myself.

37:18.934 --> 37:21.355
I'm very good at that.

37:25.685 --> 37:28.686
Aren't you going
to offer me a drink?

37:29.429 --> 37:34.798
Or have you been at the front so long
you have forgotten your manners?

37:41.654 --> 37:44.273
What shall we talk about?

37:44.439 --> 37:46.773
Your wife perhaps.

37:51.415 --> 37:53.488
Won't you join me?

37:58.071 --> 38:02.129
I am told I'm an attractive woman.

38:02.295 --> 38:04.685
You are not paying
much attention to me.

38:04.856 --> 38:07.888
Very little has escaped my attention.

38:08.632 --> 38:12.144
General Kohler did tell me one thing.

38:12.344 --> 38:18.639
What he admires most about you
is your reputation with the ladies.

38:20.090 --> 38:25.206
I regret that is the opinion
of my commanding officer.

38:28.089 --> 38:32.082
I have worked very hard
to achieve a reputation as a soldier.

38:32.249 --> 38:34.615
Do not the two go together?

38:34.777 --> 38:37.679
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him, "Thank you.

38:37.849 --> 38:40.719
I appreciate his gesture. "
And good night.

38:41.497 --> 38:43.918
You can make your own way out.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.937
Zero minus two hours.

39:07.098 --> 39:08.854
All units ready to attack.

39:09.018 --> 39:14.736
Repeat. Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.

39:24.475 --> 39:27.791
- Come on.
- Put them down, dummkopf.

39:31.898 --> 39:33.972
Hello, Kiley.

39:34.139 --> 39:37.849
I was curious to see how
you interrogate your prisoners.

39:38.010 --> 39:41.523
My other officers may be
asking the wrong questions.

39:42.236 --> 39:45.400
I'm afraid you won't
hear any new answers.

39:45.564 --> 39:49.972
Sometimes it's more important
what you see than what they say.

39:59.804 --> 40:02.488
Could we get
a little more light in here?

40:02.653 --> 40:04.595
How's that, sir?

40:16.862 --> 40:20.124
So this is the face
of the undefeated enemy.

40:20.286 --> 40:23.156
It looks like you've captured
a Sunday school class.

40:23.326 --> 40:27.156
This all they have left to put in
the front lines? Where are the weapons?

40:27.325 --> 40:29.049
Here, sir.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.815
What's this?

40:37.246 --> 40:40.147
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.

40:40.318 --> 40:42.292
- Did they put up any fight?
- No, sir.

40:42.462 --> 40:44.317
Just gave up.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.989
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.

40:48.157 --> 40:50.013
Take a good look at them, Kiley.

40:50.173 --> 40:53.819
They're not even tough enough
to be classified as delinquents.

40:53.983 --> 40:57.365
Go ahead and question them.
Ask if Germany's gonna win the war.

40:57.535 --> 40:59.423
Go ahead, Kiley.

41:00.159 --> 41:03.771
They could be plants put
in the front lines to mislead us.

41:04.959 --> 41:07.414
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.

41:07.584 --> 41:10.715
Escort these prisoners to the rear
for proper interrogation.

41:10.912 --> 41:12.570
Yes, sir. Move them out.

41:12.736 --> 41:15.256
- Let's go, move it out.
- Go!

41:16.191 --> 41:18.711
These prisoners
were carrying these rubber hoses.

41:18.879 --> 41:21.116
Send them along,
and anything else you found.

41:21.343 --> 41:23.384
Yes, sir.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.110
Do you actually still think the Germans
are preparing a major offensive?

41:30.592 --> 41:32.567
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

41:32.737 --> 41:36.249
You mean those kids are replacements
for more seasoned troops...

41:36.416 --> 41:39.351
...sent to the rear
to re-form for the big attack?

41:39.521 --> 41:41.659
Yes, sir, colonel, I do.

41:42.657 --> 41:46.366
Kiley, you're crazy. Facts mean nothing
to you. Evidence means nothing.

41:46.529 --> 41:49.877
The only thing you can see
are your own cockeyed hunches.

41:50.463 --> 41:52.472
Well, that doesn't work in the Army.

41:52.673 --> 41:56.601
I'm recommending you for transfer
to a desk in Washington.

41:59.522 --> 42:02.937
You can tell the president
how to run the war.

42:10.242 --> 42:12.064
Major.

42:24.706 --> 42:27.805
You make coffee as bad as my wife.

42:29.922 --> 42:32.639
She always told me
I'd never get along in the Army.

42:34.947 --> 42:38.143
I never had it so easy
in the police force.

42:41.443 --> 42:44.760
I've just been counting up
how many times I've been wrong.

42:44.931 --> 42:47.420
But never this wrong.

42:49.059 --> 42:51.165
All the signs point
to only one thing.

42:51.331 --> 42:54.779
Is it possible they mean
something else?

42:56.771 --> 43:00.929
Maybe this war is beyond me
and maybe Colonel Pritchard's right.

43:01.092 --> 43:03.808
Runner brought this from headquarters.
It's for you.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.281
Open it.

43:11.589 --> 43:15.364
Well, it's a picture of a Kraut colonel
and his service record.

43:15.525 --> 43:17.893
I wanted that.

43:20.772 --> 43:26.819
Well, there it is again. Panzer officer.
Fine fighting record.

43:26.981 --> 43:30.210
Last reported in the Russian front
commanding a tank regiment.

43:30.373 --> 43:32.064
What's he doing here?

43:32.229 --> 43:34.498
I'd say that proves my point.

43:34.660 --> 43:40.379
Colonel Pritchard would probably say
he got fired for losing the war in Russia.

43:41.284 --> 43:44.931
I don't know. What do you think?

43:46.246 --> 43:51.002
Well, sir. I'm regular Army.
I don't get into beefs between colonels.

43:51.814 --> 43:55.840
But I'll tell you what some
of my stir-crazy men think.

43:56.039 --> 43:59.105
They think we got
a great opportunity here.

43:59.271 --> 44:02.303
We got a chance
to wipe out Germany.

44:02.470 --> 44:06.399
Just wipe it clean off the map.
Knock everything down...

44:06.599 --> 44:07.907
...every city...

44:08.071 --> 44:11.453
...every castle, all the bridges,
all the roads. Everything.

44:11.623 --> 44:16.260
Don't leave two stones standing
together. Just wipe the slate clean.

44:16.422 --> 44:19.619
Turn Germany into a prairie,
then ship over a few buffalo...

44:19.783 --> 44:21.726
...and let them start from scratch.

44:21.896 --> 44:24.479
Now, what do you think
of that, colonel?

44:29.159 --> 44:33.893
I think your men ought to wash their
socks and take a shave. It stinks in here.

45:10.089 --> 45:12.937
- Speak English. Only English.
- Okay, lieutenant.

45:13.098 --> 45:15.847
Let's get this stuff out of here.

45:33.130 --> 45:36.327
Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

45:36.490 --> 45:41.412
Repeat. Operation Transit
parachuted behind enemy lines.

47:49.424 --> 47:50.733
What the...?

47:50.896 --> 47:52.904
What's that noise?

47:53.072 --> 47:54.861
On your feet! Everybody out!

47:55.024 --> 47:58.885
- Sounds like a thousand of them.
- Hey, Charlie, get battalion.

47:59.056 --> 48:01.544
- Get battalion.
- On the double! On the double!

48:02.384 --> 48:05.231
Sergeant, haul everybody out.

48:05.394 --> 48:08.709
- Everybody out. Come on.
- Bazooka men, report to me.

48:11.025 --> 48:13.096
The line's dead, sir.

48:14.161 --> 48:16.909
Go! Go! Go!

48:30.066 --> 48:31.343
What's that?

48:31.506 --> 48:34.670
"What's that?" And you wanted
to see Germans, right?

48:34.834 --> 48:37.551
Come on! On the double!

48:38.226 --> 48:40.463
On the double!

48:43.122 --> 48:46.252
Turn them over! Turn them over!
Let's go! Let's go!

48:46.995 --> 48:48.904
Come on,
let's get this baby moving.

48:49.938 --> 48:53.833
Colonel Hessler reports
panzer Tiger moving to the attack.

48:54.002 --> 48:55.431
No enemy activity.

48:55.602 --> 48:59.497
Northern front reporting
panzer Eisen entering Losheim Gap.

48:59.666 --> 49:01.522
No enemy opposition encountered.

49:27.188 --> 49:28.781
Southern front reporting.

49:28.948 --> 49:33.683
All elements of panzer Eisen
linking up at road junction 0-2.

50:07.637 --> 50:09.613
Stay on my tail.

50:15.190 --> 50:16.653
Soldier.

50:16.823 --> 50:18.710
Did they give you basic training?

50:18.870 --> 50:21.520
Here, you do it this way.

50:24.951 --> 50:28.464
They're green, never seen action before.
What do you expect?

50:37.079 --> 50:40.658
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.

50:40.823 --> 50:42.350
Yes, sir.

50:44.727 --> 50:47.184
Stay here. One more man
won't make a difference.

50:47.352 --> 50:51.149
- I need to look inside one of those Tigers.
- All right, come on.

51:42.746 --> 51:46.575
Relay to Standard O-bay.
I've made contact with enemy.

51:46.746 --> 51:48.633
Meeting weak resistance.

51:49.242 --> 51:53.105
Take cover! Make a stand.
Take cover! Make a stand.

51:53.275 --> 51:55.379
Make a stand.

52:13.114 --> 52:14.489
Load.

52:14.651 --> 52:16.953
I said, load!

52:33.852 --> 52:37.430
Tiger to Tank 104.
Tank 104, you're blocking the road.

52:37.597 --> 52:40.117
Get off the road at once!

52:43.165 --> 52:45.020
There's your Tiger.

52:51.164 --> 52:52.888
Wait a minute.

52:53.052 --> 52:54.547
You're gonna need this.

52:54.716 --> 52:56.659
Take the greaser.

53:38.687 --> 53:42.200
Tiger to Tank 104,
what is your condition?

53:42.974 --> 53:45.757
Tank 104, reply at once.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.024
This is Colonel Hessler.

53:53.535 --> 53:55.096
Button up!

53:55.872 --> 53:57.300
Tigers at 11 o'clock.

54:04.416 --> 54:06.522
Hit them hard, Eddie.

54:25.633 --> 54:26.909
They got Blondie.

54:33.728 --> 54:36.575
Forget it. It's like hitting them
with tennis balls.

54:42.146 --> 54:44.250
Come on, let's get out of here!

54:47.618 --> 54:48.927
Get down and stay down.

54:57.057 --> 55:00.255
Crawl, you dummy! Crawl.

55:04.898 --> 55:06.906
Lieutenant,
keep those grenades coming.

55:12.291 --> 55:14.811
Fall back!

55:16.035 --> 55:17.725
Fall back!

55:27.843 --> 55:29.697
Fall back!

55:31.652 --> 55:33.887
Fall back!

55:34.052 --> 55:35.906
Get down.

55:53.860 --> 55:56.796
Get going. Stay low.

56:30.244 --> 56:32.133
Hessler to headquarters.

56:32.838 --> 56:35.937
Resistance very weak.

56:37.542 --> 56:39.135
Southern front reporting.

56:39.302 --> 56:42.084
Commander Nimke
encountering light resistance.

56:42.246 --> 56:44.734
Enemy retreating across river K- 10.

57:43.018 --> 57:45.734
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, somebody man this gun!

57:45.895 --> 57:48.482
- Here they come!
- There they are!

58:06.762 --> 58:08.900
Give me a belt!

58:28.811 --> 58:30.818
Hey, wait for me!

58:34.666 --> 58:36.642
Grab the tailgate!

58:38.891 --> 58:40.516
Wait for me!

58:46.187 --> 58:49.057
- Where's your motor pool?
- At regiment, four kilometers.

58:49.228 --> 58:51.878
Let's get there.
I gotta get back to headquarters.

58:52.716 --> 58:54.276
- Wait for me!
- Hold it a minute!

58:54.444 --> 58:55.938
Wait for me!

59:36.174 --> 59:37.864
We haven't got a chance.

59:38.030 --> 59:40.615
Relax. Stay loose.

59:41.805 --> 59:44.489
You think we'll have to surrender?

59:45.231 --> 59:48.198
Well, I hear they treat
American prisoners real well.

59:48.398 --> 59:51.268
In a big battle,
they treat nobody real well.

59:51.694 --> 59:54.924
Come on. There's a back road
that leads to the motor pool.

59:55.118 --> 59:58.414
- Maybe we can get us a jeep.
- How do you know?

59:58.574 --> 01:00:01.291
Because I studied the maps
when we arrived here.

01:00:01.454 --> 01:00:03.875
Just like you should've done.

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:11.246
- What if we run into their lines?
- We're still ahead of them.

01:00:11.438 --> 01:00:15.181
- They might have advanced patrols.
- It's enough trouble keeping alive...

01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:17.449
...in this mess
without you bellyaching.

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:20.780
If you wanna surrender, go ahead.
I'll make it easier alone.

01:00:20.976 --> 01:00:23.245
You're out of line, sergeant.

01:00:23.856 --> 01:00:26.244
Sorry, lieutenant.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:30.539
Look, I don't need help from you.
You wanna go on by yourself, go ahead.

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:37.228
Are you coming,
or am I gonna have to carry you?

01:00:55.825 --> 01:00:57.417
Hello, Cheyenne.

01:00:57.585 --> 01:00:59.374
What's that? You're under attack?

01:00:59.537 --> 01:01:01.162
In what strength?

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.084
Well, what's your guess?

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.867
I can't give you air reconnaissance,
I'm blind.

01:01:06.033 --> 01:01:07.942
- Get Apache.
- Call Apache.

01:01:08.434 --> 01:01:10.375
Eddie, what's going on
in your sector?

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:12.815
It's only patrol action.
How heavy?

01:01:12.977 --> 01:01:16.012
Well, what does your
reconnaissance say? Nothing heavy.

01:01:16.177 --> 01:01:18.666
We're trying to get a picture.
Stay on task.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:47.376
The first phase of our offensive
was a success.

01:01:47.794 --> 01:01:49.738
The element of surprise
was complete.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:52.624
American communications
are in a turmoil.

01:01:52.787 --> 01:01:55.689
We must cross the Our River
before the enemy realizes...

01:01:55.859 --> 01:01:58.608
...we have launched
an all-out offensive.

01:02:00.691 --> 01:02:04.041
I do not believe I gave you permission
to smoke.

01:02:04.244 --> 01:02:05.967
Sorry, sir.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.893
Unfortunately, we did not have time
to get better acquainted...

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.224
...but all of you know my reputation.

01:02:15.093 --> 01:02:19.118
My command always suffers
the highest casualties.

01:02:19.988 --> 01:02:23.338
The price of victory is never cheap.

01:02:23.509 --> 01:02:27.502
In this battle, we will be
as hard as our tanks.

01:02:28.116 --> 01:02:30.987
I will reach the objectives
assigned to me...

01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:32.913
...no matter what the cost.

01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:36.336
Signal from headquarters, colonel.

01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:40.686
Hessler, I congratulate you.

01:02:40.853 --> 01:02:44.017
- You're on schedule.
- I will reach the Our River as planned.

01:02:44.182 --> 01:02:47.214
But the enemy must not be permitted
to destroy the bridge.

01:02:47.382 --> 01:02:50.032
- Has Schumacher seized it yet?
- Not yet.

01:02:50.198 --> 01:02:54.060
Schumacher's primary assignment
is to disrupt enemy communications.

01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:56.852
I must have that bridge secured
for my tanks.

01:02:57.045 --> 01:02:58.899
I have no time to build bridges.

01:03:01.014 --> 01:03:05.105
Hessler, your bridge will be secured.

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.685
We are expecting you to cross it
according to the schedule.

01:03:10.998 --> 01:03:14.893
You know your line of march.
Coordinate with the map.

01:03:19.799 --> 01:03:23.028
Conrad, I have a headache.

01:03:38.807 --> 01:03:40.368
Fire! Fire!

01:03:56.505 --> 01:03:58.610
Land mines!
Why were they not cleared?

01:03:58.777 --> 01:04:00.784
Where are the men
with mine detectors?

01:04:00.952 --> 01:04:02.415
We are moving too fast.

01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:04.471
The men are following in trucks.

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:06.062
They are all dead.

01:04:06.232 --> 01:04:09.046
The mine exploded
directly under them.

01:04:09.529 --> 01:04:11.831
Notify their seconds-in-command
to take over.

01:04:11.993 --> 01:04:14.449
Tell them I have absolute
confidence in them.

01:04:14.842 --> 01:04:16.816
We have lost a tank unnecessarily.

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:19.189
We've lost precious minutes
unnecessarily.

01:04:19.352 --> 01:04:21.720
Your troops were here
to protect the panzers.

01:04:21.881 --> 01:04:24.183
From now on,
until we clear this minefield...

01:04:24.346 --> 01:04:27.346
...your men will go ahead of my tanks.

01:04:29.146 --> 01:04:31.480
And have my vehicle repaired at once!

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:46.550
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

01:04:53.786 --> 01:04:56.155
Now, listen to me, all of you.

01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:58.868
I need precise information:

01:04:59.034 --> 01:05:01.489
How many men, how many guns...

01:05:01.658 --> 01:05:04.310
...how many tanks
the enemy are throwing into this.

01:05:04.475 --> 01:05:07.257
How much fuel are they carrying?
And get a move on.

01:05:07.419 --> 01:05:10.998
We've got 24 hours
before we scream rape.

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.614
All right, Kiley, it's your turn.

01:05:14.842 --> 01:05:17.081
They're pouring through, general.

01:05:17.243 --> 01:05:19.186
Crack troops. Brand-new equipment.

01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:23.097
I looked inside one of their tanks.
They can chew up anything we've got.

01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:26.938
- Question is, where are they going?
- Do you have that information?

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.923
No, but he does. Colonel Hessler...

01:05:29.084 --> 01:05:31.539
...the commanding officer
of the panzer spearhead.

01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:33.398
When we know where he's going...

01:05:33.564 --> 01:05:35.953
...we'll know the objective
of the attack.

01:05:36.123 --> 01:05:39.539
The enemy is probing at five points
along an 85-mile front.

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:42.075
With only that information
at our disposal...

01:05:42.236 --> 01:05:45.433
...how can you assume Hessler's column
is the spearhead?

01:05:45.597 --> 01:05:47.669
- The law of probability, Kiley?
- No, sir.

01:05:47.836 --> 01:05:49.746
The law of probability is against me.

01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:54.073
But in the absence of other information,
I've one chance in five of being right.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:57.400
- I'd like to explore that chance.
- How?

01:05:57.566 --> 01:05:59.321
- Well, sir-
- I'll tell you how.

01:05:59.486 --> 01:06:00.763
Watch the Our River.

01:06:00.925 --> 01:06:04.340
There's only one bridge, right here,
that can support heavy tanks.

01:06:04.509 --> 01:06:08.121
I'd say that's where Hessler will be,
and that's where I'll be.

01:06:08.317 --> 01:06:11.963
Don't get too close to that bridge.
I've ordered it blown up.

01:06:12.126 --> 01:06:15.160
That's a good thing to know.
Thanks for the tip.

01:06:17.694 --> 01:06:22.364
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Go on, keep moving.

01:06:22.846 --> 01:06:25.597
Come on, let's go.
You there, keep moving.

01:06:25.759 --> 01:06:27.647
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

01:06:36.991 --> 01:06:38.998
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:40.989
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

01:06:44.287 --> 01:06:47.069
Move it. Come on, keep moving.
Step on it. Get going.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.079
Come on, let's get going.
Step on it.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.927
Hey, what are you stopping for?

01:06:57.088 --> 01:06:59.477
That sign.
When we came through before...

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:03.509
- ... I recall Ambléve was that way.
- You're blocking the road. Get going.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.436
- Hurry up.
- Come on, let's go.

01:07:05.632 --> 01:07:09.145
Wait a minute. I tell you, those signs
point in the wrong direction.

01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:11.254
What's holding up the parade here?

01:07:11.456 --> 01:07:14.522
Somebody's been monkeying around
with those road signs.

01:07:14.689 --> 01:07:16.761
That ain't the road to Ambléve.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.646
Two hours ago,
I came here from Ambléve...

01:07:19.808 --> 01:07:21.435
...over this exact same road.

01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:24.318
Now, maybe they've moved Ambléve
in the meantime...

01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:26.783
...but two hours ago
this was the road to it.

01:07:26.944 --> 01:07:29.596
- Take off, Duquesne.
- Lieutenant, I'm telling you-

01:07:29.762 --> 01:07:33.078
Lieutenant, tell your sergeant
to get this jeep out of here.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:36.414
Move. That's an order. Move.

01:07:40.834 --> 01:07:43.834
Yeah, I hope they enjoy themselves
in Malmedy.

01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:49.953
- Come on. We're getting off here.
- Wait.

01:07:50.114 --> 01:07:51.804
Come on!

01:07:52.801 --> 01:07:54.262
Jump.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.905
Hey, wait a minute. Where we going?

01:08:00.066 --> 01:08:01.954
We're supposed to be in Ambléve.

01:08:02.115 --> 01:08:04.537
We'll get there.
I gotta make a pickup first.

01:08:04.739 --> 01:08:07.421
- Pickup?
- I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.

01:08:07.619 --> 01:08:10.916
Germans are coming. They'll steal it.
You gotta give me a hand.

01:08:11.076 --> 01:08:13.147
Hey, you two!

01:08:15.043 --> 01:08:17.694
Come on, keep moving. Step on it.

01:08:32.228 --> 01:08:34.595
Are you the last one?
Anybody behind you?

01:08:34.756 --> 01:08:37.790
Yeah, the whole German army.
Go ahead.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.424
You there, keep them moving.
Come on, step on it.

01:08:47.941 --> 01:08:51.420
Notify the panzers.
The bridge is intact.

01:09:06.662 --> 01:09:09.508
- Any sign of the Germans?
- No, not yet.

01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:13.019
- What are you men doing here?
- We got orders to blow the bridge.

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:14.848
- Pile out.
- Wait a minute.

01:09:15.013 --> 01:09:17.086
That job's being done.

01:09:27.558 --> 01:09:29.084
How you boys making out?

01:09:29.254 --> 01:09:32.124
- Just about finished.
- Hurry up, will you?

01:09:32.295 --> 01:09:34.629
Get out of here
before those Krauts get here.

01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:37.093
- You need any help?
- I got a good idea.

01:09:37.255 --> 01:09:42.589
We'll give them all a hot-water bottle.
That water comes straight off the ice.

01:09:42.758 --> 01:09:45.312
Well, I'm sure loaded with C-4.
Can you use any?

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:48.064
I imagine they could sell you some.

01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:51.073
Climb in.

01:09:57.159 --> 01:10:00.641
Hey, why do you got your wires
hooked on to that detonator?

01:10:03.303 --> 01:10:07.580
- I guess he's in a hurry.
- To get killed? That's not the way.

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.312
Sarge, bring a couple of men.

01:10:09.479 --> 01:10:12.295
We're gonna take a look
under that bridge.

01:10:26.793 --> 01:10:28.767
This ain't the road to Ambléve.

01:10:28.936 --> 01:10:30.278
That's what the sign says.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.637
The sign says thataway,
the map says Ambléve was this way.

01:10:33.802 --> 01:10:36.321
Will somebody straighten this out?

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:41.285
Ambléve. Ambléve.

01:10:44.937 --> 01:10:47.807
- Hey, Wolenski.
- Oh, colonel.

01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:50.565
Hey, we're all fouled up here.

01:10:50.729 --> 01:10:54.473
We've been ordered to Ambléve,
but the maps don't jibe with the signs.

01:10:54.666 --> 01:10:57.732
How'd you get off the road?
This will take you to Malmedy.

01:10:57.897 --> 01:10:59.839
- Ambléve's that way.
- That way?

01:11:00.009 --> 01:11:02.728
We've been following these road signs
the whole way.

01:11:02.889 --> 01:11:06.751
And the MPs we ran into,
they've been directing us this way.

01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:11.074
They've been changed.
They switched them around.

01:11:11.243 --> 01:11:13.131
Those MPs you ran into seem okay?

01:11:13.323 --> 01:11:16.356
- What do you mean?
- Anything odd about them?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.798
Just regular Gls.

01:11:17.994 --> 01:11:19.850
We intercepted an enemy dispatch.

01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:22.597
They were recruiting
English-speaking Germans.

01:11:22.763 --> 01:11:25.349
What time did you cross the Our River?

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:28.679
8:40. We were last ones across.
They were set to blow it.

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:30.850
- You see the bridge blown?
- No.

01:11:31.019 --> 01:11:33.637
But I saw the engineers
setting the charges.

01:11:33.804 --> 01:11:39.684
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell?
They weren't engineers, they were MPs.

01:11:41.451 --> 01:11:43.655
Murphy, get me headquarters.

01:11:43.819 --> 01:11:46.755
And, major,
have someone switch that sign back.

01:11:46.925 --> 01:11:49.577
Red River Six. Come in, Red River Six.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.734
- Come in, Red River Two.
- Red River Six, this is Red River Two.

01:11:53.901 --> 01:11:58.310
Germans uniformed as American MPs
holding Our River Bridge.

01:11:58.508 --> 01:12:00.875
Bridge has not been blown.

01:12:01.036 --> 01:12:04.298
Repeat. Germans uniformed
as American MPs...

01:12:04.462 --> 01:12:08.389
...holding Our River Bridge.
Bridge has not been blown.

01:12:08.588 --> 01:12:11.403
Over and out. Let's go.

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.518
Better hold it, Jack.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:34.090
- What happened?
- They ran into a firefight.

01:12:34.254 --> 01:12:35.977
German patrol.

01:12:36.142 --> 01:12:37.637
I don't see any Germans.

01:12:38.126 --> 01:12:40.972
They're in the river.
They didn't make it across.

01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:43.274
Get out of here.
We're blowing the bridge.

01:12:44.047 --> 01:12:46.631
What? Are you sure?

01:12:47.119 --> 01:12:49.027
Watch out, the MPs are Krauts!

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:15.910
Oh, my God! Get down!

01:13:45.905 --> 01:13:48.904
Why are we waiting?
Get that tank out of the way.

01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:51.405
We are preparing
to tow it off now, sir.

01:13:52.753 --> 01:13:56.496
Tiger to tanks Leopard and Panther.
Blast that tank off the bridge.

01:14:12.338 --> 01:14:13.833
It's headquarters, colonel.

01:14:14.003 --> 01:14:16.336
General Kohler says
we are behind schedule.

01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:19.276
He wants to know
what's holding us up.

01:14:19.441 --> 01:14:24.778
Tell the general the Americans
are learning how to retreat.

01:14:24.946 --> 01:14:31.274
Tiger to Panther. Get onto the bridge,
push that junk right out of the way.

01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:07.373
Stay down.

01:15:19.894 --> 01:15:24.148
Murphy, call headquarters. Tell them
the Our River Bridge hasn't been blown.

01:15:24.308 --> 01:15:27.244
- The enemy's crossing in great strength.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:38.421 --> 01:15:41.651
- Let me have your rifle.
- What you need is a cannon, sir.

01:15:41.813 --> 01:15:45.643
The last time I saw that German,
all I had was a camera.

01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:30.389
Can't you hurry it up, sergeant?
We lost the column.

01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:34.294
Do you happen to have a new carburetor
in your pocket, lieutenant?

01:16:35.288 --> 01:16:37.329
You mean we're stuck here?

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:42.962
Nope. We can still walk.

01:16:45.657 --> 01:16:47.511
Let's go.

01:16:49.434 --> 01:16:52.750
- Hey, maybe we can get a lift, huh?
- Hold it.

01:16:56.121 --> 01:16:58.541
We better find out
just who they are first.

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.647
Down.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.581
Yeah, Krauts. Back.

01:17:51.317 --> 01:17:54.182
If you'd just stayed loose,
I could've gotten them all.

01:18:13.205 --> 01:18:17.334
Americans in headlong retreat.
Our forces are advancing on all fronts.

01:18:18.644 --> 01:18:20.886
Great numbers of prisoners
are being taken.

01:19:18.775 --> 01:19:21.265
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:24.368
If you wanted to make a run for it,
why didn't you?

01:19:25.466 --> 01:19:27.802
I'm in your outfit, lieutenant.

01:19:27.956 --> 01:19:31.695
My job is to look out for you,
go where you go.

01:19:36.155 --> 01:19:38.764
I sure got you into the wrong place
this time.

01:19:39.283 --> 01:19:41.679
But I'm glad you're with me.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:48.084
When we get to the POW camp,
they'll separate us...

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.937
...you being an officer.

01:19:51.957 --> 01:19:53.844
Yeah.

01:19:55.413 --> 01:19:57.395
I'm gonna miss you, sergeant.

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:19.249
Run!

01:20:36.853 --> 01:20:38.517
Keep going!

01:21:37.468 --> 01:21:39.544
Get going. Come on, step on it.

01:21:56.182 --> 01:21:57.468
- Is she here?
- No.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.485
Well, tell her I'm back, huh?

01:22:09.207 --> 01:22:13.208
I want you all to fan out. Round up
every man that belongs to this outfit.

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:15.994
We will assemble here in 10 minutes.
On the double.

01:22:16.158 --> 01:22:17.361
Let's go.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.589
What's all this?

01:22:30.743 --> 01:22:32.951
What's it look like?
My place of business.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.630
- What are the chickens for?
- They lay eggs.

01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:43.181
Any idea what fresh eggs
brings in these days?

01:22:43.356 --> 01:22:45.492
Oh, beautifuI, beautifuI.

01:22:46.814 --> 01:22:49.233
All right, open the door,
that's my partner.

01:22:55.994 --> 01:22:58.708
Look, run down to the tank park
and check us both in.

01:22:58.872 --> 01:23:01.397
- But-
- And then report back to me. Go ahead.

01:23:02.176 --> 01:23:05.434
The chickens look scrawny.
Have you been feeding them regular?

01:23:05.599 --> 01:23:07.027
I was worried about you.

01:23:07.192 --> 01:23:10.071
- Is it true the Germans are coming?
- Right through here.

01:23:10.236 --> 01:23:12.950
- We gotta sell everything, fast.
- Then you'll leave?

01:23:13.115 --> 01:23:18.709
Face it, kid, we're out of business.
One case of champagne, $360.

01:23:18.874 --> 01:23:24.348
Two dozen nylons, $80.
Twenty bottles of perfume, $200.

01:23:24.513 --> 01:23:28.985
Six hundred and forty dollars.
Here's your half.

01:23:29.186 --> 01:23:32.502
Three hundred and twenty dollars.
All right, what did you make?

01:23:32.667 --> 01:23:35.958
One thousand, two hundred
and thirty dollars. Here.

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:42.745
What have you been selling?
I don't see much stock gone.

01:23:42.909 --> 01:23:45.435
- Take it.
- I won't untiI I know how you made it.

01:23:45.601 --> 01:23:48.182
- What do you think I am?
- What do you think I am?

01:23:49.434 --> 01:23:53.304
- It's money I've saved for us.
- For us? What are you talking about?

01:23:54.331 --> 01:23:58.460
When a woman goes in business
with a man, it means forever.

01:23:58.649 --> 01:24:02.685
What's forever? The shop is closed.
The Germans are coming.

01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:04.880
They've been here before.

01:24:05.057 --> 01:24:06.874
I've lived through it.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.589
I will live through it again.

01:24:15.263 --> 01:24:17.115
I will wait for you.

01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:24.479
How can you feeI this way about me?
I never laid a hand on you.

01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:26.497
That's why.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.798
You're in love with me.

01:24:32.256 --> 01:24:35.157
Just a second. Hold the phone.

01:24:35.323 --> 01:24:36.987
Hold the phone, here.

01:24:38.013 --> 01:24:39.512
Shut up.

01:24:56.763 --> 01:24:58.650
You know what?

01:24:58.816 --> 01:25:00.502
You're right.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.382
There.

01:25:03.547 --> 01:25:06.368
You hold all the money.
I gotta go back in action.

01:25:06.533 --> 01:25:08.598
You don't know
what it's like in combat.

01:25:08.763 --> 01:25:10.911
You get shot,
somebody takes your money.

01:25:11.076 --> 01:25:14.296
Before the plasma comes,
a guy's got his hand in your pocket.

01:25:14.815 --> 01:25:17.365
Guffy. Guffy.

01:25:18.628 --> 01:25:22.203
- I don't want you to get killed.
- Who's talking about getting killed?

01:25:22.369 --> 01:25:23.867
You take care of the money.

01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:28.444
Sarge, the tanks aren't there. They've
been pulled back. We gotta catch up.

01:25:31.324 --> 01:25:33.211
So long, partner.

01:25:33.696 --> 01:25:34.971
Take care of yourself.

01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:36.562
Guffy.

01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:42.805
Don't you want to kiss me?

01:25:58.499 --> 01:26:02.074
Don't forget to feed the chickens, huh?

01:26:07.005 --> 01:26:09.944
Keep moving. Let's go, keep moving.

01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:14.109
Come on, sarge, we gotta catch up
with the tanks. Let's go!

01:26:14.311 --> 01:26:16.611
Goodbye, Louise!

01:26:20.068 --> 01:26:21.555
Put that in there.

01:26:21.731 --> 01:26:24.280
Come on, get to it. Get to it.

01:26:58.759 --> 01:27:02.168
Lion Battalion,
take up bombardment position.

01:27:02.334 --> 01:27:04.504
Panther Battalion, stand by.

01:27:10.535 --> 01:27:12.317
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:28.646 --> 01:27:31.397
- Hold it. Where you running?
- The Germans are coming.

01:27:31.585 --> 01:27:34.689
- Where's your rifle? Where's your outfit?
- Captured.

01:27:34.854 --> 01:27:39.644
- Dead. Gone. They're all gone.
- Sergeant, stop that man!

01:27:39.811 --> 01:27:42.748
He's not doing anything we aren't.

01:28:02.406 --> 01:28:03.810
We're staying.

01:28:03.974 --> 01:28:05.945
Countermand that order to fall back.

01:28:06.146 --> 01:28:09.049
All units are to make a stand
where they are and fight.

01:28:09.215 --> 01:28:11.963
And that means everybody.
Except tanks.

01:28:12.165 --> 01:28:15.007
Clerks, cooks, bakers, staff officers.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:18.430
Anybody who can carry a rifle
is to use it.

01:28:22.242 --> 01:28:25.238
- Kiley.
- Come on, bring it all in.

01:28:27.397 --> 01:28:31.586
It's very difficult for me to say this.
I was wrong.

01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:43.044
- Sergeant, hauI them out again.
- Everybody out.

01:28:43.209 --> 01:28:45.404
Come on, what are you waiting for?

01:28:46.242 --> 01:28:48.036
Well, it looks like we're staying.

01:28:48.202 --> 01:28:51.125
- I never have a rifle when I need one.
- Take mine.

01:28:51.303 --> 01:28:53.476
- It's on the house.
- I'll return it later.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.449
- Let's go!
- Let's go. Come on.

01:28:58.819 --> 01:29:00.673
We're on the line, sir.

01:29:00.873 --> 01:29:04.129
GeneraI Grey speaking. Fred.

01:29:04.294 --> 01:29:07.493
I'm holding at Ambléve,
but I can't last without heavy stuff.

01:29:07.659 --> 01:29:09.439
What can you let me have?

01:29:10.372 --> 01:29:14.170
155s will do the trick.
Where are they? On flatcars.

01:29:14.335 --> 01:29:16.166
Are we still holding the raiI line?

01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:19.104
Good.
Now, when can you get them here?

01:29:20.543 --> 01:29:23.647
Well, not later, Fred.
We're counting on you.

01:31:59.555 --> 01:32:01.088
Bring that ammo up!

01:32:01.253 --> 01:32:04.970
Stack it up. Position, on the wall.

01:32:10.953 --> 01:32:12.899
Get some beef behind it.

01:32:13.443 --> 01:32:15.331
Hey, lay those logs in there.

01:32:20.651 --> 01:32:23.425
Let's go! Let's move it out.

01:32:25.644 --> 01:32:28.428
First Platoon, follow me.
Second Platoon, over there.

01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:36.134
Fire.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.869
Soldier!

01:33:26.022 --> 01:33:27.521
Go! Go!

01:33:34.092 --> 01:33:35.710
Everybody out!

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:38.695
- Wait a minute. Where you men going?
- To the shelter.

01:33:38.859 --> 01:33:42.174
- No, you're not. Grab your rifles.
- But we're cooks.

01:33:42.341 --> 01:33:45.514
Lunch is over.
Get your rifles and follow me.

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.289
- Stay away from the buildings!
- Soldier, up front.

01:33:52.454 --> 01:33:54.211
I'm in the Air Corps.

01:33:54.375 --> 01:33:56.677
You're in the infantry now. Follow me.

01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.816
We're driving them back.
They're running.

01:34:59.982 --> 01:35:01.633
This is only the first round.

01:35:35.238 --> 01:35:36.938
Why have you stopped?

01:35:37.104 --> 01:35:38.508
They have dug in.

01:35:38.672 --> 01:35:41.292
- It's a very strong defense.
- Bypass it.

01:35:41.458 --> 01:35:44.797
- I have considered that.
- There's nothing to consider.

01:35:45.871 --> 01:35:50.920
We must measure what we might gain
by what we might lose.

01:35:52.432 --> 01:35:54.250
Come on.

01:36:04.714 --> 01:36:08.136
You were to have been 10 kilometers
west of Ambléve by this hour.

01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:09.576
Why are you still here?

01:36:09.777 --> 01:36:12.739
My first attack failed.
I must take Ambléve.

01:36:12.938 --> 01:36:17.093
We are wasting time.
Time, Hessler, you don't have much.

01:36:17.257 --> 01:36:20.195
Ambléve is an isolated resistance.
Go around it.

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.534
We have surrounded
and bypassed Bastogne. Do the same.

01:36:23.689 --> 01:36:26.662
GeneraI, it will be dark in one hour.

01:36:26.828 --> 01:36:30.626
I want your permission
for a night assault with all my armor.

01:36:31.724 --> 01:36:32.998
ColoneI Hessler...

01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:36.514
...you will break off this engagement,
proceed with your mission.

01:36:36.751 --> 01:36:38.851
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:42.923
GeneraI, before you go,
may I show you something?

01:36:43.123 --> 01:36:44.608
What is it?

01:36:49.010 --> 01:36:51.335
A chocolate cake.

01:36:52.043 --> 01:36:53.389
Well?

01:36:53.555 --> 01:36:57.707
It was taken from a captured
American private. It's still fresh.

01:36:58.001 --> 01:37:02.403
If you will look at the wrapping, generaI,
you will see it comes from Boston.

01:37:02.698 --> 01:37:04.126
And?

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.854
GeneraI,
do you realize what this means?

01:37:08.078 --> 01:37:10.757
It means that the Americans
have fueI and planes...

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:14.084
...to fly cake
across the Atlantic Ocean.

01:37:15.277 --> 01:37:18.025
They have no conception of defeat.

01:37:18.379 --> 01:37:22.096
We have the opportunity here
to break their morale...

01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:24.811
...to destroy their will to fight.

01:37:25.069 --> 01:37:28.645
That is why you must permit me
to reduce Ambléve to ashes.

01:37:40.044 --> 01:37:44.172
You have untiI 0400.

01:37:44.657 --> 01:37:46.345
That is all.

01:41:10.136 --> 01:41:13.262
We have silenced their guns.
Now we will attack.

01:41:13.429 --> 01:41:16.332
Your infantry will go in with my tanks.

01:41:16.495 --> 01:41:18.253
Yes, sir.

01:41:34.195 --> 01:41:36.308
Second Platoon, over there.

01:41:36.472 --> 01:41:37.899
Let's go. Move it out.

01:41:38.065 --> 01:41:41.675
We'd better get going, sir, before
the town is completely surrounded.

01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:46.702
Shall I send a runner to Major Wolenski
telling him to cover our withdrawaI?

01:41:46.868 --> 01:41:50.313
No, that's the kind of order I give
to a man myself.

01:42:19.187 --> 01:42:20.780
Aim at the trench!

01:43:03.034 --> 01:43:05.335
Some more. Let's get closer.

01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:16.426
Bring up some more plastique!

01:43:49.914 --> 01:43:51.095
Major Wolenski!

01:43:52.345 --> 01:43:54.068
The generaI.

01:43:56.156 --> 01:43:58.964
Hurry up! Move that ammo up!

01:44:01.242 --> 01:44:03.506
Wolenski, we've been ordered out.

01:44:03.672 --> 01:44:07.943
I'll need time to save what I can. Your
outfit will have to cover the withdrawaI.

01:44:08.122 --> 01:44:10.989
- They're coming down the chimney, sir.
- Do what you can.

01:44:11.165 --> 01:44:12.782
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:17.300
I only loaned you this rifle.

01:44:18.232 --> 01:44:21.715
- See you later, major.
- Yes, sir.

01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:28.346
Spread out.

01:44:45.466 --> 01:44:47.224
Bring up ammo!

01:46:28.724 --> 01:46:30.353
Sister.

01:46:31.711 --> 01:46:33.138
ColoneI, excuse me.

01:46:33.304 --> 01:46:35.381
We are looking for someone
who can help.

01:46:35.546 --> 01:46:37.068
Be brief.

01:46:37.246 --> 01:46:40.206
There are many wounded townspeople
in the church cellar.

01:46:40.382 --> 01:46:43.723
We need medicine, bandages.
Can you spare any?

01:46:43.959 --> 01:46:45.586
We have nothing to spare.

01:46:45.752 --> 01:46:48.986
If there are captured medicaI supplies,
give them to the nuns.

01:46:49.174 --> 01:46:51.863
Yes, sir. Follow me.

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:25.494
He fired with this.

01:47:31.002 --> 01:47:33.588
Jean, Jean, Jean!

01:47:39.227 --> 01:47:41.328
Don't do anything to him, please.

01:47:41.505 --> 01:47:42.909
This is the boy's father.

01:47:43.063 --> 01:47:46.261
I beg you. He's just a little boy.

01:47:46.426 --> 01:47:48.951
He's my only child.

01:47:49.469 --> 01:47:52.501
Don't do anything to him, please.

01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.590
Release the boy.

01:48:02.556 --> 01:48:03.865
Jean.

01:48:06.178 --> 01:48:08.373
Shoot the father.

01:48:11.841 --> 01:48:15.005
- Papa! Papa!
- No!

01:48:23.064 --> 01:48:24.657
ColoneI.

01:48:24.833 --> 01:48:27.194
The senior American officer
taken prisoner...

01:48:27.357 --> 01:48:29.458
...requests permission
to speak with you.

01:48:29.624 --> 01:48:32.763
- What does he want?
- He'll only discuss it with you.

01:48:32.928 --> 01:48:34.970
- Rank?
- Major.

01:48:35.582 --> 01:48:38.391
- He has two minutes.
- Yes, sir.

01:48:52.668 --> 01:48:54.296
Conrad.

01:48:56.928 --> 01:49:00.504
- What is this food?
- It's the best this town has to offer.

01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:03.865
I told you, tanks run on petroI
and soldiers run on rations.

01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:08.503
I must eat as my men do so I know
how far they can go. Take it away.

01:49:18.557 --> 01:49:21.554
- Conrad.
- Yeah?

01:49:23.938 --> 01:49:27.549
My Christmas present,
it's for your sons.

01:49:27.714 --> 01:49:29.471
Your promotion to first sergeant.

01:49:37.601 --> 01:49:40.279
My sons thank you.

01:49:43.453 --> 01:49:44.704
Go in.

01:49:48.987 --> 01:49:50.545
What is it?

01:49:50.723 --> 01:49:54.202
ColoneI, stragglers you've captured
tell me...

01:49:54.369 --> 01:49:57.472
...that helpless American prisoners
have been massacred.

01:49:58.273 --> 01:50:00.917
- Where?
- Malmedy.

01:50:01.083 --> 01:50:05.790
And as senior officer, I can't controI
my men unless I have your assurance...

01:50:05.956 --> 01:50:09.943
...they'll not be murdered. I want your
signed order stating that my men...

01:50:10.109 --> 01:50:12.316
...will be accorded the protection...

01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:15.549
...guaranteed prisoners of war
by the Geneva Convention.

01:50:15.902 --> 01:50:19.738
Unless I return with that order, coloneI,
the prisoners will riot.

01:50:19.903 --> 01:50:22.688
Undoubtedly, you'll kill us,
but so help me...

01:50:22.853 --> 01:50:25.567
...we'll take a hell of a lot
of you with us.

01:50:26.404 --> 01:50:29.272
There will be no signed order.
There will be no riot.

01:50:29.437 --> 01:50:33.332
You will not be allowed to return
to your men to instigate that riot.

01:50:34.522 --> 01:50:37.178
You listen to me, coloneI.

01:50:37.378 --> 01:50:39.479
There are survivors in all massacres.

01:50:39.644 --> 01:50:42.132
I warn you,
if any of my men are harmed...

01:50:42.297 --> 01:50:46.913
...you will be held responsible. There will
be no place on earth that you can hide.

01:50:47.065 --> 01:50:51.774
And when you're found, I hope I'm the
man that ties the rope around your neck.

01:50:54.181 --> 01:50:56.187
Major...

01:50:56.352 --> 01:51:00.152
...I have never liked threats.

01:51:00.316 --> 01:51:02.711
I do not kill prisoners.

01:51:02.877 --> 01:51:08.033
But I will have no compunction at
shooting you myself for your last remark.

01:51:08.222 --> 01:51:10.051
Then do it.

01:51:16.742 --> 01:51:20.482
You are deliberately trying
to provoke me.

01:51:22.299 --> 01:51:24.919
Yes, coloneI, that's right.

01:51:25.155 --> 01:51:30.240
If I walk out of here alive, I know
my men will be properly treated.

01:51:31.526 --> 01:51:33.143
DiepeI!

01:51:36.353 --> 01:51:39.834
Return this officer
to the prisoners' compound, alive.

01:51:39.999 --> 01:51:41.461
Come.

01:51:42.559 --> 01:51:46.358
Major, I'm relying on you
to reassure your men...

01:51:46.523 --> 01:51:50.689
...I have no time
for troublesome prisoners.

01:51:54.181 --> 01:51:57.816
Tiger to Standard O-bay,
GeneraI Kohler.

01:52:00.483 --> 01:52:03.196
Your usuaI ration, sir.

01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:08.825
GeneraI Kohler. Hessler.

01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:13.981
GeneraI, is it true that American
prisoners were executed at Malmedy?

01:52:14.206 --> 01:52:16.696
There are SS units
in the Malmedy sector.

01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:20.612
I can't assume responsibility
for every soldier on this front.

01:52:21.155 --> 01:52:24.318
Do you realize the consequences
of this act?

01:52:24.483 --> 01:52:28.060
I have lost 17 tanks and a battalion
of men leveling Ambléve...

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:31.644
...for the sole purpose of reducing
the enemy's will to fight.

01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:34.937
This massacre will stiffen resistance
to us everywhere.

01:52:35.103 --> 01:52:39.232
It will turn a demoralized mob
into avenging soldiers.

01:52:39.422 --> 01:52:41.287
You are being insolent, coloneI.

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.268
Concern yourself with your mission.

01:52:43.421 --> 01:52:45.946
You are to reach Saint-MicheI
by 1600 tomorrow.

01:52:46.111 --> 01:52:50.112
- Be there.
- Yes, sir.

01:53:19.622 --> 01:53:22.914
They've taken a beating,
and they look it.

01:53:23.682 --> 01:53:25.404
They're not a rabble.

01:53:25.569 --> 01:53:28.154
They're retreating like soldiers.

01:53:32.224 --> 01:53:34.431
There's still fight in them.

01:53:34.915 --> 01:53:37.758
Where are we gonna stop
and put up the fight?

01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:42.208
At our last line of defense,
the River Meuse.

01:53:42.373 --> 01:53:45.158
We'll cross it
and dig in on the west bank.

01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:47.836
At least we'll get the Germans wet.

01:53:50.916 --> 01:53:53.252
Still sore I pulled you out of Ambléve?

01:53:53.416 --> 01:53:56.130
I was contributing
to the war effort there, sir.

01:53:56.296 --> 01:54:00.543
Try to keep your feet from freezing
while we figure a way to stop them.

01:54:00.708 --> 01:54:02.750
They've made mistakes before.

01:54:02.916 --> 01:54:05.335
Where have they made one this time?

01:54:06.881 --> 01:54:09.251
Well, they got me mad at them.

01:54:18.763 --> 01:54:21.346
Shut up. We'll get there.

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:27.647
Come on. Come on.

01:54:28.934 --> 01:54:31.035
Keep moving! Keep moving!

01:54:31.235 --> 01:54:34.750
- What's holding you up?
- I'm out of gas.

01:54:34.916 --> 01:54:37.983
I reported low about an hour ago.
Where's the fueI truck?

01:54:38.208 --> 01:54:41.983
Get off the road and wait for it.
Keep moving.

01:54:42.185 --> 01:54:44.567
- Pull it over.
- Move it!

01:54:46.562 --> 01:54:48.155
Come on!

01:54:51.588 --> 01:54:53.631
Keep moving.

01:54:53.795 --> 01:54:56.662
Keep moving. Move it.

01:55:07.436 --> 01:55:09.665
Where are you going?
Will you wait a minute?

01:55:09.832 --> 01:55:11.872
I need gas.

01:55:13.759 --> 01:55:15.200
Oh, get down.

01:55:18.090 --> 01:55:20.355
Why, you ugly jerk!

01:55:31.648 --> 01:55:34.586
Here, use your big mouth on that.

01:55:35.813 --> 01:55:37.854
Hey, come on, let's get with it.

01:55:42.187 --> 01:55:44.993
What are you laughing at?
Come and move this thing.

01:55:45.159 --> 01:55:47.814
- You're all wet, sarge.
- Now get it up.

01:55:54.281 --> 01:55:57.891
- What are you gonna do with this?
- "What are you gonna do with this?"

01:55:58.055 --> 01:55:59.944
Siphon with it, idiot. Put it in.

01:56:01.644 --> 01:56:04.641
- What are you thinking?
- Same thing you are.

01:56:04.805 --> 01:56:07.590
Those prisoners you brought
had rubber hoses on them.

01:56:07.755 --> 01:56:09.950
They've been carrying those
to siphon gas?

01:56:10.116 --> 01:56:12.509
At the Our River,
I saw a German fueI truck...

01:56:12.676 --> 01:56:15.048
...drop oiI drums in the water,
they floated.

01:56:15.874 --> 01:56:18.693
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Gasoline, sir.

01:56:18.859 --> 01:56:22.600
Empty fueI drums and men carrying
siphon hoses add up to one thing.

01:56:22.764 --> 01:56:25.631
The Germans are low on gas.
They have to forage for it.

01:56:25.797 --> 01:56:27.967
That's their weakness.

01:56:29.419 --> 01:56:32.346
- Get this off to headquarters.
- Sir.

01:56:32.711 --> 01:56:37.018
A, what is the fueI consumption
of a Tiger tank?

01:56:37.644 --> 01:56:41.278
B, the exact distance from the
Siegfried Line to the Meuse River.

01:56:41.443 --> 01:56:45.785
C, what is the estimate of fueI reserves
in the German army?

01:56:45.961 --> 01:56:48.476
- That's it.
- Yes, sir, right away.

01:56:51.979 --> 01:56:54.399
What are you laughing at, you idiot?

01:57:03.532 --> 01:57:05.348
What is the situation in Bastogne?

01:57:05.516 --> 01:57:08.453
Our forces have completely
encircled the Americans.

01:57:08.618 --> 01:57:13.090
Their situation is hopeless. They have
no recourse but to surrender.

01:57:17.161 --> 01:57:20.323
Hey, look what's coming. Lieutenant!

01:57:32.395 --> 01:57:33.893
Halt!

01:57:41.221 --> 01:57:43.557
The German commander wishes
to communicate...

01:57:43.722 --> 01:57:47.108
...with the American commander
of the encircled town of Bastogne.

01:57:47.273 --> 01:57:49.986
He's a little busy right now.
What's on your mind?

01:57:52.076 --> 01:57:55.898
"From the German commanding generaI
to the commander of American troops...

01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:57.669
...fighting in Bastogne.

01:57:58.601 --> 01:58:00.548
With the changing fortunes of war...

01:58:00.713 --> 01:58:03.875
...the U.S.A. forces
in and around Bastogne...

01:58:04.041 --> 01:58:08.867
...have become completely surrounded
by superior German armored units.

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.324
The only possibility
to spare the American troops...

01:58:12.489 --> 01:58:16.548
...from totaI annihilation
is their honorable surrender...

01:58:16.749 --> 01:58:21.127
...which will also prevent the slaughter
of helpless civilians. "

01:58:21.798 --> 01:58:24.524
You have one hour of truce to reply.

01:58:25.869 --> 01:58:27.758
Blindfold him.

01:58:27.912 --> 01:58:29.705
Take him up to the command post.

01:58:46.225 --> 01:58:48.289
Repeat, please.

01:58:50.565 --> 01:58:52.359
Is that all?

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:55.204
Sir, I have a message from Bastogne.

01:59:00.206 --> 01:59:01.480
What is it?

01:59:01.645 --> 01:59:04.289
I don't understand it.

01:59:05.742 --> 01:59:09.411
"From the American commander of
Bastogne to the German commander.

01:59:09.576 --> 01:59:11.238
Nuts. "

01:59:14.695 --> 01:59:16.455
Nuts.

02:00:25.034 --> 02:00:26.921
Hey, over there.

02:00:28.267 --> 02:00:29.518
Hey, it's an officer.

02:00:29.706 --> 02:00:31.500
Boy, are we glad to see you.

02:00:31.666 --> 02:00:34.438
- I haven't eaten in 12 hours.
- We got lost.

02:00:34.639 --> 02:00:36.043
Hold it. Wait a minute.

02:00:36.208 --> 02:00:38.886
Do you think we should surrender,
lieutenant?

02:00:41.128 --> 02:00:42.922
Surrender?

02:00:43.819 --> 02:00:45.412
No.

02:00:47.371 --> 02:00:50.639
Just stay loose, all of you. Stay loose.

02:00:50.827 --> 02:00:52.645
Now, give me that light.

02:01:00.008 --> 02:01:02.699
All right, spread out.
Get some rest.

02:01:02.862 --> 02:01:05.223
We'll get started when it's light.

02:01:34.922 --> 02:01:36.232
GeneraI Grey.

02:01:36.434 --> 02:01:38.733
Sir, this just came in.

02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:43.053
- Move along.
- Any of you guys been to Ambléve?

02:01:43.218 --> 02:01:45.129
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

02:01:45.295 --> 02:01:49.283
- Any of you guys been to Ambléve?
- Come on, Guffy, we'll get in trouble.

02:01:49.448 --> 02:01:51.242
I gotta know.

02:01:52.398 --> 02:01:54.310
I've been to Ambléve.

02:01:54.475 --> 02:01:56.009
- You know Ambléve inn?
- Yeah.

02:01:56.173 --> 02:01:57.602
Well, it's okay, isn't it?

02:01:57.779 --> 02:02:00.233
There's nothing left of it.

02:02:04.622 --> 02:02:06.699
Guffy, come on.

02:02:11.725 --> 02:02:14.145
When are they gonna let us fight?

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:16.397
Let's go.

02:02:20.977 --> 02:02:24.777
It's here, sir, the information
you requested from headquarters.

02:02:26.770 --> 02:02:28.292
That's it.

02:02:28.458 --> 02:02:30.476
They're running out of gas.

02:02:31.501 --> 02:02:34.405
Where's the spearhead of
the German advance right now?

02:02:34.570 --> 02:02:38.250
We place it four miles past Ambléve,
moving west.

02:02:38.415 --> 02:02:40.068
Where will they be at daybreak?

02:02:40.268 --> 02:02:45.355
If they traveI all night, they should be
nine miles due east of the fueI depot.

02:02:45.557 --> 02:02:47.656
We'll be there to meet them.

02:02:47.821 --> 02:02:50.476
I'm committing my tanks.

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:52.458
We'll use plan F.

02:02:52.623 --> 02:02:55.727
- Get me Blue Code 301.
-301.

02:02:56.021 --> 02:03:00.140
All right, mount up. Crank them up.
Let's go. Let's go.

02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:04.941
Let's go. Crank them up,
crank them up.

02:03:26.098 --> 02:03:28.034
Look at that fog.

02:03:28.941 --> 02:03:32.365
If it stays, we won't find them
and we won't fight.

02:03:33.015 --> 02:03:35.821
If it lifts, they'll find us.

02:03:36.529 --> 02:03:39.596
And that will be the end of our men
and our tanks.

02:03:41.355 --> 02:03:43.975
And I'm praying that it lifts.

02:03:45.970 --> 02:03:48.496
What does that make me, Dan?

02:03:49.935 --> 02:03:51.821
A generaI.

02:04:03.599 --> 02:04:05.993
Is that so, generaI?

02:04:06.194 --> 02:04:07.657
It's very interesting.

02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:10.596
Thank you, generaI.

02:04:16.141 --> 02:04:19.044
Our column has made
the farthest advance.

02:04:19.221 --> 02:04:24.850
We have outrun the other panzers.
The eyes of Germany are on us.

02:04:25.015 --> 02:04:28.330
The Führer himself will decorate me.

02:04:29.333 --> 02:04:31.881
We have done it, Conrad.
We have done it.

02:04:32.046 --> 02:04:34.761
Then I was wrong.
We have won the war.

02:04:35.279 --> 02:04:36.968
No.

02:04:37.747 --> 02:04:39.692
You mean we have lost?

02:04:39.857 --> 02:04:41.746
No.

02:04:42.584 --> 02:04:46.538
I don't understand. If we have not won
and we have not lost...

02:04:46.701 --> 02:04:47.987
...then what's happening?

02:04:48.176 --> 02:04:51.693
The best thing possible is happening.
The war will go on.

02:04:52.177 --> 02:04:55.209
- For how long?
- Indefinitely.

02:04:55.823 --> 02:04:58.891
On and on and on.

02:04:59.350 --> 02:05:03.127
- But it must come to an end.
- You're a fooI, Conrad.

02:05:03.314 --> 02:05:07.987
Those of us who understood
knew, in 1941, we could never win.

02:05:08.496 --> 02:05:11.729
You mean, coloneI, for three years,
we have been fighting...

02:05:11.895 --> 02:05:15.881
- ... without any hope of victory?
- There are many kinds of victory.

02:05:16.047 --> 02:05:19.881
For the German army to survive,
for us to remain in uniform...

02:05:20.048 --> 02:05:22.573
...that is our victory.

02:05:22.737 --> 02:05:27.375
Conrad, the world is not going
to get rid of us after all.

02:05:29.263 --> 02:05:31.209
But when do we go home?

02:05:33.014 --> 02:05:34.631
This is our home.

02:05:36.791 --> 02:05:42.383
And my sons? When do I see them?
What will become of them?

02:05:43.057 --> 02:05:48.425
They will become German soldiers,
and you will be proud of them.

02:05:55.765 --> 02:05:57.038
Conrad.

02:05:57.206 --> 02:06:01.676
You still have any of those delicacies left
you offered me at Ambléve?

02:06:01.878 --> 02:06:02.857
Yes, sir.

02:06:03.187 --> 02:06:07.210
Prepare them for me, will you?
I'm in very good appetite.

02:06:11.859 --> 02:06:13.771
- See anything?
- Nothing.

02:06:13.937 --> 02:06:16.047
It's like they disappeared.

02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:22.372
- They been spotted yet?
- No, sir.

02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:25.004
They must have changed course
during the night.

02:06:27.034 --> 02:06:29.040
Call our scouts again.

02:06:36.697 --> 02:06:39.175
- See anything?
- Nothing.

02:06:39.671 --> 02:06:41.677
Red River Six. Red River Six.

02:06:41.842 --> 02:06:43.600
Scouted designated territory.

02:06:43.766 --> 02:06:45.253
No sign of German tanks.

02:06:54.231 --> 02:06:58.763
Can't see 20 yards. They're nowhere
around, or I'd hear something.

02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:02.705
Let's be reasonable, coloneI.

02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:05.902
You expect me to take you up?
Nothing's flying in this fog.

02:07:06.066 --> 02:07:08.780
That makes it safe. We won't
bump into another plane.

02:07:08.945 --> 02:07:12.392
How can we see the panzer column
when we have zero visibility?

02:07:12.569 --> 02:07:16.520
You'll catch pneumonia if you don't
stop arguing. Get behind that stick.

02:07:16.792 --> 02:07:18.645
Wait a minute.

02:07:18.810 --> 02:07:20.367
Where are the flying orders?

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:22.386
I wanna see them.

02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:25.206
I wanna know what lunatic
issued them.

02:07:25.689 --> 02:07:29.028
There are no orders, Joe.
I'm the lunatic.

02:07:30.007 --> 02:07:33.100
Well, there's no insanity in my family.

02:07:33.689 --> 02:07:37.325
If we don't find that panzer column,
there will be no tank battle.

02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:39.495
We'll have to stop them with infantry.

02:07:39.673 --> 02:07:42.575
A lot of guys are gonna die
to keep you safe and cozy.

02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:45.560
You sure know how
to hit below the belt. That's dirty.

02:07:45.973 --> 02:07:49.620
We're not in a pillow fight, Joe.
Sorry it hurts.

02:07:51.708 --> 02:07:53.607
Get in.

02:07:57.300 --> 02:07:59.567
All reports negative, sir.

02:08:08.817 --> 02:08:11.567
Well, they must be someplace.

02:08:12.499 --> 02:08:15.368
The earth couldn't have just
swallowed them up.

02:08:18.068 --> 02:08:21.336
- Send out additionaI patrols.
- Yes, sir.

02:08:30.327 --> 02:08:33.646
What am I doing up here?
It's like flying inside a light bulb.

02:08:33.811 --> 02:08:36.628
Just stay on the course I gave you.
We'll find them.

02:08:36.796 --> 02:08:39.662
- How do you know?
- Hessler's looking for gas.

02:08:39.827 --> 02:08:42.965
He's gambling on capturing our supply.
Get lower.

02:08:43.156 --> 02:08:46.458
- We're down to 500 feet.
- We just have to pick up a landmark.

02:08:46.611 --> 02:08:50.128
Hills are all around. We'll pick up
a landmark right in the kisser.

02:08:50.293 --> 02:08:52.052
Try it a little lower.

02:09:00.856 --> 02:09:04.372
- I can't see a damn thing.
- All right, cut your engine.

02:09:04.893 --> 02:09:07.098
Glide and listen. We can hear them.

02:09:07.261 --> 02:09:12.855
- Are you telling me to glide at 200 feet?
- Cut the talk and the engine.

02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:33.774
- I'm calling this off.
- Sure. Now, let's try it again.

02:09:37.942 --> 02:09:40.312
Okay, cut your engine.

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:46.707
If we were 100 feet higher,
I'd jump and leave you here.

02:09:46.872 --> 02:09:48.430
Quiet.

02:09:57.492 --> 02:09:59.946
There's the depot.

02:10:04.702 --> 02:10:06.555
There's the river.

02:10:07.898 --> 02:10:10.612
The column has to be due south.

02:10:12.314 --> 02:10:13.590
That's your course.

02:10:17.176 --> 02:10:19.736
Get her down, Joe,
where we can see.

02:10:22.463 --> 02:10:25.834
- What's our altitude?
- Four hundred feet.

02:10:26.015 --> 02:10:28.077
All right, cut the engine.

02:10:36.501 --> 02:10:37.968
Do you hear that?

02:10:38.142 --> 02:10:40.279
Yeah. We're going down for a look.

02:10:52.053 --> 02:10:54.747
Hit your engine, let's get out of here.

02:10:57.079 --> 02:11:00.348
Red River Six, this is Red River Two.
The enemy column sighted.

02:11:00.504 --> 02:11:04.467
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

02:11:04.667 --> 02:11:07.125
Enemy column sighted, sir.

02:11:07.289 --> 02:11:09.149
Found them.

02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:13.623
Present position, map coordinates:
8-7-3, 1-4-4.

02:11:18.296 --> 02:11:20.784
Repeat. Enemy column sighted.

02:11:24.834 --> 02:11:27.605
Come in, Red River Two.
Come in, Red River Two.

02:11:27.806 --> 02:11:29.119
Come in, Red River Two.

02:11:29.271 --> 02:11:31.416
- Contact broken.
- Where's that coordinate?

02:11:31.584 --> 02:11:33.362
- Right here.
- What's the terrain?

02:11:33.564 --> 02:11:35.192
Low rolling hills.

02:11:35.357 --> 02:11:37.815
Order our tanks to intercept them
at that point.

02:11:37.979 --> 02:11:40.078
- Yes, sir.
- Red River Two.

02:11:40.277 --> 02:11:43.385
- That's Kiley.
- I know.

02:11:46.050 --> 02:11:48.057
There's a plane up there.

02:11:49.659 --> 02:11:51.901
He's in trouble.

02:12:06.934 --> 02:12:10.038
Medic! Medic!

02:12:29.624 --> 02:12:31.193
Schneider.

02:12:32.667 --> 02:12:34.807
From Spitzbergen,
the weather forecast.

02:12:35.006 --> 02:12:37.175
Warm front moving in.

02:12:39.063 --> 02:12:42.864
Notify all columns, weather clearing.

02:13:01.117 --> 02:13:03.984
Enemy forces are reported crossing
the River Meuse.

02:13:04.162 --> 02:13:07.194
Send scouts forward.
I want their numbers and composition.

02:13:07.359 --> 02:13:08.376
Yes, sir.

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:11.408
Conrad. My binoculars.

02:13:13.825 --> 02:13:15.681
Conrad?

02:13:23.716 --> 02:13:25.757
I was saying I wanted-

02:13:27.736 --> 02:13:29.850
What is it, Conrad?

02:13:30.015 --> 02:13:32.472
Nothing, sir.

02:13:34.168 --> 02:13:38.454
I was saying I wanted my binoculars.

02:13:42.238 --> 02:13:44.304
What's wrong?

02:13:45.379 --> 02:13:49.604
I would like to be transferred
to other duties, sir.

02:13:52.575 --> 02:13:57.814
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't ask me, sir. Just transfer me.

02:13:58.816 --> 02:14:01.592
- For combat duty?
- Yes, sir.

02:14:03.045 --> 02:14:06.817
You want to fight?
Very admirable, but why?

02:14:08.958 --> 02:14:11.350
PersonaI reasons, sir.

02:14:13.628 --> 02:14:15.927
PersonaI reasons.

02:14:16.865 --> 02:14:20.864
PersonaI reasons? What the deviI
are you trying to say?

02:14:21.028 --> 02:14:24.058
It's the right of every German soldier
to ask permission...

02:14:24.223 --> 02:14:26.327
...for a transfer to other duties.

02:14:26.501 --> 02:14:29.841
It is the right of every commanding
officer to know the reason...

02:14:30.018 --> 02:14:34.561
- ... for the transfer, and I
want the truth. - The truth...

02:14:34.726 --> 02:14:38.546
...is that I'm a fooI.
I believed in you.

02:14:38.726 --> 02:14:41.333
But all you believe in is the war.

02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.541
You have the war. You like the war.

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:48.000
And all I have are my sons,
and I don't want to lose them.

02:14:48.799 --> 02:14:52.732
- I'm not responsible for your children.
- You are. You'd make them soldiers.

02:14:52.894 --> 02:14:54.807
- Yes. They will fight.
- They will die.

02:14:54.971 --> 02:14:58.429
- If necessary.
- Necessary for who? For you?

02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:03.384
You are not only a fooI,
you are a traitor.

02:15:05.947 --> 02:15:08.992
And you are a murderer.

02:15:09.158 --> 02:15:13.948
You would murder my sons.
You would murder my country.

02:15:14.112 --> 02:15:17.499
You would murder the whole world
to stay in that uniform.

02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:28.344
It is only the memory of you
as a friend...

02:15:28.509 --> 02:15:32.262
...that prevents me from having you
court-martialed. Get out.

02:15:40.957 --> 02:15:44.380
Our scouts have sighted a brigade
of medium tanks.

02:15:45.926 --> 02:15:49.427
- Light armor at this point? Any artillery?
- None.

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:52.353
- And no infantry.
- They're committing their reserves.

02:15:52.506 --> 02:15:56.132
We destroy them, they have nothing
between us and the fueI depot.

02:15:57.214 --> 02:16:00.357
- Send all infantry to the rear.
- Yes, sir.

02:16:01.759 --> 02:16:06.972
DiepeI, assign this man to fueI trucks.

02:16:09.833 --> 02:16:11.680
Yes, sir.

02:16:15.716 --> 02:16:18.174
Sir, enemy advancing on our position.

02:16:18.338 --> 02:16:21.691
Good. They've taken the bait.

02:16:23.106 --> 02:16:24.665
Pritchard...

02:16:24.837 --> 02:16:28.179
...we're going to test that information
we got from headquarters.

02:16:29.610 --> 02:16:31.653
If it's accurate...

02:16:32.076 --> 02:16:34.625
...we'll run them out of gas.

02:16:37.449 --> 02:16:42.018
Tiger to all units, close hatches.
Forward.

02:17:33.475 --> 02:17:36.098
Butcher, swing up and take positions
on the ridges.

02:17:40.838 --> 02:17:45.475
And watch that damn gully.
This is no time to lose a track.

02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:14.715
Here they come.

02:18:21.511 --> 02:18:24.473
Hold your fire
till they're right on us.

02:18:27.552 --> 02:18:30.977
Load with hypershot.
Make every one count.

02:18:40.531 --> 02:18:42.123
- Hold your fire.
- How long?

02:18:42.289 --> 02:18:43.931
UntiI I tell you!

02:18:47.849 --> 02:18:49.448
Attack in staggered formation.

02:18:49.612 --> 02:18:52.540
First, Lion on the assault.
Second, Panther.

02:18:56.392 --> 02:18:59.683
Remember, hold your fire
till they're within effective range.

02:19:07.914 --> 02:19:11.111
- How long are we gonna wait?
- UntiI we can hit a soft spot.

02:19:12.004 --> 02:19:13.464
Steady.

02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:14.883
Steady.

02:19:15.049 --> 02:19:17.383
Hold it. Hold it.

02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:20.843
Let them come on in. Let them come in.
That's the way.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.683
Now! Let them have it!

02:19:49.892 --> 02:19:53.000
Fire one more round,
then let's get the hell off this ridge.

02:20:04.873 --> 02:20:08.169
There's one coming up over the rise.
You see him?

02:20:09.995 --> 02:20:12.576
Steady, boy. Ready on.

02:20:14.507 --> 02:20:16.418
Fire!

02:20:26.666 --> 02:20:30.177
Tiger to Panther, spread out to left.
Lion, spread out to right.

02:20:30.339 --> 02:20:32.331
We will try to encircle.

02:20:37.205 --> 02:20:40.251
Sherman damaged.
We'll finish it off.

02:20:40.417 --> 02:20:44.134
Fire! It's a hit.

02:20:44.907 --> 02:20:46.793
The next, 11 o'clock, 900.

02:20:52.641 --> 02:20:53.633
Get in among them.

02:20:53.796 --> 02:20:57.000
Mix with them so they can't fire
without hitting each other.

02:21:05.833 --> 02:21:09.931
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.
There's a Kraut at 1 o'clock...

02:21:10.096 --> 02:21:11.916
...with a pennant on his antenna.

02:21:13.837 --> 02:21:15.905
This one belongs to me. He's mine.

02:21:16.546 --> 02:21:18.278
There he is.

02:21:18.443 --> 02:21:23.296
All right, kick her left, kid. Left.
Now, hard right! Hard right!

02:21:26.162 --> 02:21:30.500
Stay with them! Range, 9-0-0.
Up two.

02:21:31.721 --> 02:21:33.352
Fire!

02:21:35.152 --> 02:21:36.580
Good shot! We got him!

02:21:36.976 --> 02:21:39.750
Load again. Nothing has happened.

02:21:39.953 --> 02:21:42.950
Hey, watch it. They see us.
Hey, let's get out of here.

02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:48.796
Aim just ahead as he runs.

02:21:55.413 --> 02:21:56.964
Fire!

02:22:05.928 --> 02:22:07.750
Butcher One, this is Butcher Three.

02:22:07.916 --> 02:22:10.437
Come in, Butcher Three.
Report damage. Over.

02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:15.245
I've got one dead and two wounded,
but we can still fight.

02:22:16.781 --> 02:22:20.421
You lost your gun. Pull out. Try
to make it back to the assembly area.

02:22:20.642 --> 02:22:22.719
We don't need a gun!
We can ram them.

02:22:23.087 --> 02:22:25.186
Guffy, you're all busted up.

02:22:25.350 --> 02:22:29.620
Get out of there and make it back to
the assembly area. That's an order. Out.

02:22:30.576 --> 02:22:32.645
Get her over the hill.

02:22:36.974 --> 02:22:38.986
Driver, halt.

02:22:39.463 --> 02:22:41.055
Let's try to pick them off.

02:22:41.256 --> 02:22:45.518
Ten o'clock. Sherman, 800. Fire!

02:23:23.631 --> 02:23:25.453
Baker Battalion reporting in.

02:23:25.619 --> 02:23:28.642
Two tanks destroyed, one damaged,
out of action.

02:23:28.809 --> 02:23:32.708
Phantom Battalion reports six tanks
destroyed, nine out of action.

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:37.833
Butcher Battalion reports 11 tanks
destroyed, eight on fire.

02:23:39.412 --> 02:23:42.125
Keep burning up their gas.

02:23:53.076 --> 02:23:56.616
Commander to base,
I am returning to refueI.

02:24:41.966 --> 02:24:44.102
We are cutting them to pieces.

02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:46.886
And they are emptying our tanks.

02:24:51.248 --> 02:24:55.559
They are deliberately sacrificing
their armor to bleed us dry.

02:24:56.809 --> 02:25:00.551
- What is the distance to the fueI depot?
- Twelve kilometers.

02:25:01.325 --> 02:25:03.303
You will continue the battle here.

02:25:03.465 --> 02:25:06.413
Let them believe their strategy
is succeeding.

02:25:06.577 --> 02:25:09.353
I want 15 tanks and all
the empty trucks.

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:13.472
- I'm going on to the depot.
- Yes, sir, 15 tanks and fueI trucks.

02:25:13.904 --> 02:25:15.599
Forward.

02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:37.289
Hey, come on, soldier.
You can make it.

02:25:47.791 --> 02:25:49.417
Pull it off the road!

02:25:49.623 --> 02:25:52.002
- Wait!
- Come on! Come on!

02:25:55.917 --> 02:25:59.300
Pull it off the road! Pull it off!

02:26:01.295 --> 02:26:03.240
Get off the tank.

02:26:03.415 --> 02:26:05.959
- Stay off the tank!
- You've got plenty of room.

02:26:06.125 --> 02:26:09.199
- You can carry these guys.
- This tank ain't going no place.

02:26:09.362 --> 02:26:11.505
Get off the tank!

02:26:12.045 --> 02:26:14.018
Wherever you're going,
you better walk.

02:26:14.199 --> 02:26:17.041
- What are you waiting here for?
- For the Germans.

02:26:17.208 --> 02:26:19.665
They gotta come by here.

02:26:20.850 --> 02:26:22.541
And I still got a machine gun.

02:26:23.762 --> 02:26:25.707
There's not much you can
do with that.

02:26:25.906 --> 02:26:28.969
- How much ammo do you have left?
- Two belts.

02:26:29.134 --> 02:26:32.074
That will take care of some of them.

02:26:33.208 --> 02:26:37.164
You got a wounded man. You think
you ought to get him to the medics?

02:26:37.805 --> 02:26:40.709
Oh, he's not too bad.
He can still fight.

02:26:42.037 --> 02:26:43.249
Get on, fellas.

02:26:43.414 --> 02:26:46.723
Pull this tank back.
Head it west towards the River Meuse.

02:26:46.889 --> 02:26:49.676
I'm warning you, lieutenant,
stay off my tank.

02:26:54.513 --> 02:26:57.458
Either put up that gun or fire it,
sergeant.

02:27:03.542 --> 02:27:06.833
It's okay, sarge. It's okay.

02:27:41.169 --> 02:27:44.491
GeneraI, another panzer column
has been spotted four miles...

02:27:44.666 --> 02:27:47.537
- ... from the River Meuse.
- Where did they come from?

02:27:48.270 --> 02:27:50.666
Get me the officer in charge
of the fueI depot.

02:27:50.874 --> 02:27:53.082
Get Silver Cloud 201. Quickly.

02:27:53.261 --> 02:27:55.570
It's not a new column.

02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:58.286
It's Hessler.

02:27:58.458 --> 02:28:02.351
- He slipped away from the battle.
- The fueI depot, sir.

02:28:02.516 --> 02:28:06.087
GeneraI Grey speaking.
I'm giving you this order personally.

02:28:06.254 --> 02:28:09.328
Destroy the fueI depot at once.
I repeat.

02:28:09.528 --> 02:28:11.625
Destroy the fuel depot at once.

02:28:11.791 --> 02:28:16.915
Yes, sir. I'll destroy the depot
immediately, sir. Set it on fire.

02:28:17.081 --> 02:28:21.808
No, sir, not a drop. I'll make sure
of that, sir. They won't get a drop.

02:28:24.589 --> 02:28:28.555
All right, let's get these bodies
out of here. Let's go. Move!

02:28:45.394 --> 02:28:49.002
Elke and Eisner report fueI
exhausted, sir.

02:28:49.167 --> 02:28:51.083
What's Hessler's present position?

02:28:51.250 --> 02:28:54.513
He reports being three kilometers
from the American fueI depot.

02:28:54.708 --> 02:28:56.916
We must get there.

02:28:57.116 --> 02:29:01.418
He will do it. Hessler will do it.

02:29:13.658 --> 02:29:16.425
No shooting. I'll do the talking.

02:29:16.594 --> 02:29:18.000
Get back to your post.

02:29:22.836 --> 02:29:25.494
- Hold it up there, sergeant.
- Stop it.

02:29:26.006 --> 02:29:29.834
- What can I do for you boys?
- We just made it. Could you fill her up?

02:29:30.006 --> 02:29:33.833
Sure. Give you a hand, soldier. Sure.

02:29:34.125 --> 02:29:36.428
CorporaI, bring some of those
cans over here.

02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:38.257
A couple of you boys help out.

02:29:38.619 --> 02:29:42.895
Sergeant, we'll have you gassed up
and on your way in no time.

02:29:43.059 --> 02:29:45.228
Get on your machine gun.

02:29:45.392 --> 02:29:48.079
- Hey, lieutenant.
- Yeah?

02:29:49.497 --> 02:29:53.458
Weren't you directing traffic
at the Our River Bridge?

02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:56.916
Does the road to Ambléve
still lead to Malmedy?

02:30:14.875 --> 02:30:16.501
Stop.

02:30:23.543 --> 02:30:27.049
This fueI dump must be taken intact.

02:30:30.333 --> 02:30:32.695
No shooting.

02:30:50.799 --> 02:30:54.258
- Look. Let's get out of here.
- Hold it. They'll capture the gas.

02:30:54.423 --> 02:30:56.662
We can't just leave it.

02:30:58.166 --> 02:31:02.633
- What are you waiting for? Let's go.
- Hold it! They're after the gas.

02:31:04.375 --> 02:31:07.754
- We ought to blow it up.
- We can't set a match to all that.

02:31:07.923 --> 02:31:12.179
- We got no orders, lieutenant.
- Yeah? Well, I'm giving the orders.

02:31:12.592 --> 02:31:15.625
Hey, lieutenant,
one of them is still alive.

02:31:18.519 --> 02:31:21.240
Hold it! Hold it! He's one of ours.

02:31:23.093 --> 02:31:25.073
- I got you, coloneI.
- Burn it.

02:31:25.247 --> 02:31:27.573
- Take it easy. I know what to do.
- Burn it.

02:31:27.738 --> 02:31:30.516
- Give him a hand, if you can.
- Burn it.

02:31:30.708 --> 02:31:34.671
Come on, I'm waiting for you!
Come on!

02:31:34.963 --> 02:31:38.416
Get those barrels off the end
of that ramp. Hold your fire, Guffy.

02:31:38.583 --> 02:31:41.782
Move your tank behind that pile
untiI I tell you to shove.

02:31:41.947 --> 02:31:45.664
You, get me some hand grenades
off the tank. Come on.

02:31:50.421 --> 02:31:51.833
Come on.

02:31:53.136 --> 02:31:55.888
You, get to that gas truck
and open all the valves.

02:31:56.051 --> 02:31:59.250
Then get the hell away from it.

02:32:21.977 --> 02:32:23.791
All right, roll them down.

02:32:26.422 --> 02:32:27.704
Get off the road.

02:32:28.034 --> 02:32:30.094
Give me a hand grenade.

02:33:22.655 --> 02:33:24.335
He's getting away.

02:33:30.041 --> 02:33:32.433
Okay, shove.

02:33:40.893 --> 02:33:44.846
Don't stop! Keep going! Don't stop!

02:35:16.128 --> 02:35:17.886
Get this message to headquarters:

02:35:18.041 --> 02:35:22.750
They've abandoned their tanks,
and they're walking back to Germany.
