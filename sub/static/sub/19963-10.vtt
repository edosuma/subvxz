00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:04.605 --> 00:05.204
(theme song playing)

00:09.110 --> 00:12.378
<i>¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i>and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.480
<i>¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i>something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.482 --> 00:20.185
<i>¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i>and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:23.355
<i>¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i>blowing through ¶</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:28.193
<i>¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i>who knows where ¶</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.896
<i>¶ I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.898 --> 00:37.102
<i>¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.714
Nothing makes me happier
than a dream coming true!

00:49.917 --> 00:51.483
Especially when that dream

00:51.485 --> 00:54.053
belongs to a dear friend
like Attila.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.988
So, let me be the first
to welcome

00:55.990 --> 00:58.824
Attila the Bun Bakery
to Corona!

01:00.327 --> 01:03.295
(wind whistling)

01:04.765 --> 01:06.265
(clears throat)

01:06.267 --> 01:10.536
My mom always said
that you can only get
what you want outta life

01:10.538 --> 01:13.439
by using the Three C's:

01:13.441 --> 01:16.842
crime, carnage...
and crime.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.944
But thanks to Rapunzel,

01:18.946 --> 01:22.047
who helped make
all this possible,

01:22.049 --> 01:25.417
I've learned
there's a fourth C:

01:25.419 --> 01:26.785
kindness.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.121
(cheering)

01:29.123 --> 01:32.691
-Uh, "kindness" doesn't
start with--
-Uhn-uh.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.427
Now, who wants a treat?!

01:35.429 --> 01:37.963
-Oh, I do!
-Me!

01:37.965 --> 01:40.365
One bimberry butternut,
please.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.434
(all cheering)

01:42.436 --> 01:44.369
Attila:
Hey, hey. Guys, come on.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.371
You got to pay for those,
you know.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.907
I'm running a legitimate
business here.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.009
Huh?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.947
Hey, you know
I'm good for it, right?

01:54.949 --> 01:57.716
(Attila grumbles)

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
Boy:
I want a cookie
and a croissant

02:01.122 --> 02:03.489
and a baumkuchen
and a muffin,

02:03.491 --> 02:06.091
-and...
-Good afternoon.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.227
-Can I interest you in--
-Mommy, look!

02:08.229 --> 02:10.162
A big, scary
no-faced man!

02:10.164 --> 02:12.197
(stuttering)
Look, mister,
we don't want any trouble.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.101
Oh, let 'em run.
Ya know, once word gets out

02:16.103 --> 02:17.803
about how good
your baking is

02:17.805 --> 02:21.173
no one is gonna care
that you are...

02:21.175 --> 02:22.908
-you.
-Besides...

02:22.910 --> 02:26.345
it's still early.
Most people don't even
like sweets in the morning.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.413
Kid:
I want something sweet
this morning!

02:31.318 --> 02:33.785
All:
Uncle Monty!

02:33.787 --> 02:35.053
Hi-ya, kids!

02:38.792 --> 02:42.194
-Rapunzel.
-Montgomery.

02:42.196 --> 02:45.497
I just came by to wish
my new neighbor good luck,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.699
and to be one of his
first customers!

02:47.701 --> 02:50.769
Wow! Oh, my goodness.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.437
(chomping)

02:52.439 --> 02:55.874
I believe
I will try one of these
bimberry butternuts!

02:55.876 --> 02:58.143
They're my specialty!

02:58.145 --> 03:00.479
I grow
the bimberries myself.

03:00.481 --> 03:03.215
(chomping)

03:03.217 --> 03:06.552
Attila,
this are bimberry terrific!

03:06.554 --> 03:07.686
(chomping)

03:09.690 --> 03:12.291
Hey, Feldspar!
You've simply got to try

03:12.293 --> 03:15.460
one of these
bimberry butternuts!
They're outta this world!

03:15.462 --> 03:17.663
Oh, thanks, Uncle Monty.
I certainly wi--

03:17.665 --> 03:19.898
Whoa! Oh, my--
Oh, help!

03:19.900 --> 03:22.000
Oh, my--
he's a giant man!

03:22.002 --> 03:23.569
Don't you worry.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.071
Attila the Bun is going
to be just as successful

03:26.073 --> 03:28.840
as the Sweet Shoppe,
if not more so.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.643
And we are all going
to help! Right guys?

03:31.645 --> 03:35.547
-You bet! I'm in!
-Hey, who can float me
change for a carp?

03:35.549 --> 03:39.751
You see, I figured
we can get around the whole
Attila-is-terrifying thing

03:39.753 --> 03:43.722
by luring people in
with the good stuff.

03:45.226 --> 03:48.160
I was talking about the face,
but sure, yeah, these
could work, too.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.195
Free samples!
Who wants 'em?

03:50.197 --> 03:53.065
Free samples!
Come on, people,
they are free!

03:53.067 --> 03:55.867
Don't make me go
full smolder on you--
it might hurt.

03:55.869 --> 04:00.205
Now, listen, pal.
You're in the mood
to buy cakes.

04:00.207 --> 04:04.910
A lotta cakes.
'Cause if you don't,
my friend and I--

04:04.912 --> 04:07.713
will take you
on a resplendent
walking tour

04:07.715 --> 04:09.514
of the Corona Art Museum.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.284
-(mumbling)
-Now, you have a wondrous day.

04:14.088 --> 04:18.457
What is more welcoming
for a bakery than a giant
cupcake? Hello!

04:21.562 --> 04:22.928
Now...

04:22.930 --> 04:25.063
to get people's attention.

04:25.065 --> 04:28.233
Rapunzel, no! Not bells!

04:28.235 --> 04:30.402
(gasps)
Milton hates bells!

04:30.404 --> 04:33.372
(bleating angrily)

04:33.374 --> 04:35.407
-Aah!
-(snarling)

04:35.409 --> 04:37.709
Milton, no!
Down, boy!

04:37.711 --> 04:39.278
Whoa!

04:41.915 --> 04:44.316
Rapunzel:
Seek higher ground!

04:44.318 --> 04:45.484
High ground.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.620
(squeaking)

04:50.157 --> 04:53.258
So...
how did we do today?

04:53.260 --> 04:56.128
Okay, just a minute.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.996
Nuts, I lost count.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.132
Oh, here,
let me count for you.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.333
That would be two.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.669
And me and Vlad
been punching people
all day.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.103
And nothing!

05:05.105 --> 05:07.939
People just don't
respond to threats
like they used to.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.008
(scoffs)
People.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.577
Monty:
Closing time, everyone.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.179
Crowd:
Aww.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.349
Ah, what the heck.
Come on in.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.918
-Boy: Thank you, Monty.
-(crowd cheering)

05:21.588 --> 05:23.422
Oh, I know what
you're thinking, old friend.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.791
Sure, the Sweet Shoppe
is a Corona institution.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.527
Monty-- Monty is a pillar
of the community.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.762
Not to mention--hm!
His candy?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.765
Truly, it's as if magical
sugar fairies

05:33.767 --> 05:35.701
descended from the heavens

05:35.703 --> 05:38.036
and sprinkled blessings
on all of us.

05:38.038 --> 05:42.007
We are transformed by Monty
and all that he makes,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.209
and the fructose
of his life.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.179
Ahem! What Big Nose
is trying to say, Attila,

05:47.181 --> 05:50.215
is never give up
on your dream.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.118
-I believe in you.
-I don't know, Princess.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.722
maybe it was dumb
to think a guy like me
could ever be good enough

05:56.724 --> 05:58.557
to pull off something
like this.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.892
Okay, okay.
No need to worry.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.628
There's plenty of everything
for everybody.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.630
(shoppers exclaiming)

06:05.632 --> 06:08.867
Maybe some folks
just ain't allowed
to have dreams.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.241
Rapunzel:
I was up all night

06:16.243 --> 06:18.543
and I think I came up
with some really neat,

06:18.545 --> 06:21.179
bell-free ideas
to help Attila the Bun!

06:21.181 --> 06:23.815
Wow! You are really
committed to this.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.084
I'm just tired
of cutting ribbons,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.552
and hosting parties,

06:27.554 --> 06:29.721
and making appearances.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.258
Well, Blondie,
a statesperson's work
is never done.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.560
Being a statesperson
is fine, Eugene,

06:35.562 --> 06:37.996
but I want to do things
that really matter

06:37.998 --> 06:39.664
to the people
of Corona.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.999
Like helping Attila.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.435
(gasps)
Oh, no!

06:50.711 --> 06:52.677
What happened?

06:52.679 --> 06:54.212
Guard:
Excuse us, Princess.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.715
I'm innocent,
Rapunzel!

06:56.717 --> 06:59.201
Innocent!

06:59.202 --> 07:01.686
He's under arrest for vandalism.
It's the captain's orders

07:02.923 --> 07:04.756
I'm sorry, Princess.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.396
I guess I was right.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.132
Some folks just ain't
allowed to have dreams.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.600
(horses whinny)

07:23.410 --> 07:24.709
Nigel:
<i> Court is now in session.</i>

07:24.711 --> 07:27.712
His Majesty King Frederic
presiding.

07:27.714 --> 07:31.082
Attila didn't do it!
I know he didn't.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.818
I'm sorry,
Your Highness.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.787
Not only does Attila
have motive and no alibi,

07:35.789 --> 07:38.323
the evidence is overwhelming.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.993
<i> There were two puncture marks</i>
<i> in one of Monty's syrup vats</i>

07:41.995 --> 07:45.897
<i> that match the horns</i>
<i> on Attila's helmet exactly.</i>

07:45.899 --> 07:48.433
<i> When we went</i>
<i> to question Attila,</i>

07:48.435 --> 07:52.737
<i> I found one of Uncle Monty's</i>
<i> stolen secret family recipes</i>

07:52.739 --> 07:54.840
<i> stuck to the bottom</i>
<i> of his boot.</i>

07:57.077 --> 08:01.079
<i>Not to mention, moments before</i>
<i>the vandalism was reported,</i>

08:01.081 --> 08:04.282
<i> two of my men happened</i>
<i> to see Attila in the area.</i>

08:04.284 --> 08:07.919
<i> When they called to him,</i>
<i> he ran off.</i>

08:07.921 --> 08:10.422
Why would
an innocent man run?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.526
I'm sorry,

08:14.528 --> 08:17.195
but after reviewing the evidence
and his previous record,

08:17.197 --> 08:19.865
I have no choice
but to exile Attila

08:19.867 --> 08:22.667
to the Prison Barge
of the Lost Sea.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.840
This is crazy!
He's innocent.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.710
Ah! There has to be a way
we can prove it.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.612
I don't think
we're gonna have time.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.213
Time...time...

08:35.215 --> 08:37.148
(gasps)
<i>Onus procedendi!</i>

08:37.150 --> 08:38.717
What?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.853
Uh, Your Majesty,
I would like to cite
<i> onus procedendi.</i>

08:41.855 --> 08:43.522
Wait, what is that?

08:43.524 --> 08:46.157
Shh! It's Latin.
Smart people talk.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.326
Don't worry.
She'll go slow.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.328
I've been reading
all about Corona Law--

08:50.330 --> 08:51.530
You've been what?

08:51.532 --> 08:54.199
and by<i> onus procedendi,</i>
Attila can be granted

08:54.201 --> 08:56.701
a 24-hour period
to prove his innocence,

08:56.703 --> 08:59.971
provided that he has
retained the sponsorship
of a statesperson.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.073
And I'm pretty sure
that being princess

09:02.075 --> 09:04.042
qualifies me
as a statesperson

09:04.044 --> 09:07.345
She is correct,
Your Majesty.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.813
Uh, very well.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.750
Then you have 24 hours
to prove his innocence,

09:11.752 --> 09:13.585
Princess.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.557
You know, you should
open a book sometime.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.358
It's really,
really fun.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.494
Shapes make letters.
Letters make words.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.095
Words communicate thought.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.897
Circle of life.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.202
Rapunzel:
<i> Everyone, listen up!</i>

09:31.204 --> 09:34.005
We need to prove
where Attila was
last night.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.174
Can anyone
give him an alibi?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.343
-I can!
-I can give him an alibi,
absolutely.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.780
I'm sorry,
can anyone give him
an alibi without lying?

09:46.753 --> 09:50.922
That's the thing.
Attila won't tell anyone
what he did last night.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.925
Only that he didn't do
what they said he did.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.896
You know,
Attila is actually a very,
very private person.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.298
He's painfully shy.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.967
He doesn't seem that shy.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.468
Ever wonder why he wears
that helmet?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.136
I just assumed
he was repugnant.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.972
Well, obviously,
there's that too.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.774
All right, if no one
can vouch for Attila,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.576
then we're gonna need
hard evidence.

10:11.578 --> 10:14.846
I think it's time we checked out
the scene of the crime.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.918
I closed a little late
last night,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.453
and there was nothing
out of the ordinary.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.122
But when I came in
this morning... well.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.458
I'm so sorry
this happened, Monty.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.394
Oh, it's all right.
I was thinking of remodeling
anyway.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.829
Although I suppose,
a few months ago,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.797
that thought never would have
crossed my mind.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.902
-(Pascal squeals)
-Ah! Ugh.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.105
(squeaking)

10:40.107 --> 10:42.073
(chuckles)

10:42.075 --> 10:45.910
Are you sure you don't
want to rethink the whole
barefoot thing?

10:45.912 --> 10:48.513
Yep. These are about
as far apart

10:48.515 --> 10:50.348
as the horns
on Attila's helmet.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.984
(Eugene chuckles)
Hey!

10:52.986 --> 10:54.986
Here's Monty's
secret recipe

10:54.988 --> 10:57.088
for blondies, Blondie.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.925
-What is it?
-The door shards.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.294
They're all over the sidewalk.

11:03.296 --> 11:07.032
-Huh,
-Yeah, Attila really did
some damage, huh?

11:07.034 --> 11:09.300
-(Pascal snarls)
-I mean...

11:09.302 --> 11:12.303
I mean, someone--
someone did some damage.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.172
(snarling)

11:14.174 --> 11:16.641
(sniffs)
Wow! Smell that?

11:16.643 --> 11:18.943
Something in here
really stinks, huh?

11:18.945 --> 11:21.513
Yeah, all the, uh,

11:21.515 --> 11:24.549
syrup in here
must be going bad.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.685
Hey, Cassandra,

11:26.687 --> 11:30.889
let's go see if we can find
someone to remove that foot
from your mouth, shall we?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.992
Listen, Princess.
What you're trying to do
for Attila

11:33.994 --> 11:35.460
is incredibly noble,

11:35.462 --> 11:38.063
but it's not looking good
for him.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.899
I know it's not,
but I'm standing by him.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.001
That's what friends do.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.135
Hmm.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.310
Ugh. Something's missing.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.046
Yeah, sleep.
Blondie, it's 4:00 AM.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.515
Eugene, why don't you
go get some rest?

11:57.517 --> 12:00.318
No. No. We--

12:00.320 --> 12:02.487
We are in this togeth--

12:02.489 --> 12:06.057
(snoring)

12:13.734 --> 12:16.935
(squeaking)

12:16.937 --> 12:18.770
(sighs deeply)

12:18.772 --> 12:20.271
I don't know, Pascal.

12:20.273 --> 12:24.676
Maybe there is no way to prove
Attila's innocent.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.945
Or maybe he's not innocent.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.848
Old lady:
Oh, he's innocent all right.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.416
-(gasps) Who's there?
-(squeaking)

12:31.418 --> 12:34.786
Attila couldn't have been
responsible!

12:38.692 --> 12:41.426
Old Lady Crow--
Ms. Crowley?

12:41.428 --> 12:44.596
I saw that half-wit
plucking flowers
from my garden

12:44.598 --> 12:47.432
right about when they said
the shop was vandalized.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.635
Oh. You saw Attila
picking flowers?

12:50.637 --> 12:52.470
What did I just say?

12:52.472 --> 12:55.240
Do you think you could testify
before the king tomorrow?

12:55.242 --> 12:57.075
You bet I could.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.410
Oh, thank you!

12:59.412 --> 13:01.546
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.148
I know a lot of people
give you a hard time,

13:03.150 --> 13:05.383
but I just knew deep down
that you were--

13:05.385 --> 13:08.887
I'm only doing this
'cause I wanna see that
knuckle-dragging sod-horse

13:08.889 --> 13:10.488
get what's coming to him.

13:10.490 --> 13:14.292
No one messes
with my plumbagos!

13:17.063 --> 13:19.030
Okay then.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.734
Your Majesty, you have seen
that the evidence

13:22.736 --> 13:25.670
undeniably places blame
on Attila.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.339
Unless evidence
to the contrary
comes forth,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.341
I see no need
to carry on.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.576
I do!

13:31.578 --> 13:35.780
I call to the stand
Ms. Hortense Q. Crowley!

13:35.782 --> 13:37.849
-(crowd exclaiming)
-Uh, Blondie,

13:37.851 --> 13:41.186
you probably shouldn't
just be making up people.
This is a court of law.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.289
Ugh. Old Lady Crowley?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.724
-Oh!
-Oh, excellent.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.763
-Captain of the Guard:
Of course.
-(grumbling)

13:52.999 --> 13:54.632
Old Lady Crowley:
<i> That's right.</i>

13:54.634 --> 13:56.501
<i> I saw Attila that night.</i>

13:56.503 --> 14:00.205
He was pickin'
my precious plumbagos.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.440
So, Dad,
I think we can all agree

14:02.442 --> 14:04.509
that it's impossible
for anyone

14:04.511 --> 14:07.946
to be in two places
at once.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.848
The defense rests.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.783
I just have one question.

14:11.785 --> 14:14.219
Old lady--
er, Ms. Crowley,

14:14.221 --> 14:17.121
would you be so kind
as to point to the man

14:17.123 --> 14:19.190
you saw
picking the flowers?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.159
Of course I can!

14:21.161 --> 14:23.027
That's him!

14:23.029 --> 14:24.863
Right there!

14:24.865 --> 14:26.531
Huh?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.233
(gasps)

14:28.235 --> 14:29.868
(sobbing)

14:29.870 --> 14:31.135
I couldn't help myself!

14:31.137 --> 14:33.238
I'm a sucker for plumbagos.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.175
Ms. Crowley,
you told me you saw Attila
the other night!

14:37.177 --> 14:39.043
That's not him?

14:39.045 --> 14:43.147
How should I know?
Those boys all look
the same.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.417
(sighs)

14:46.419 --> 14:49.087
Then, I am afraid
I have no choice.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.855
Attila will be exiled

14:50.857 --> 14:53.491
to the Prison Barge
of the Lost Sea.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.228
(sighs)
Attila!

14:59.032 --> 15:01.933
I'm so sorry!

15:06.172 --> 15:07.939
Raps,
you gotta eat.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.073
How can I?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.743
Right now,
Attila is being
put on a ship

15:11.745 --> 15:13.578
that will take him away
forever.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.680
(chewing)
Look, Blondie,

15:15.682 --> 15:17.248
I know you try to see
the best in everyone,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.751
and I think that's great.
But sometimes, you know,

15:19.753 --> 15:21.419
people let you down.
Not us,

15:21.421 --> 15:23.221
but other--
(belches)

15:23.223 --> 15:24.255
people.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.456
Oh. You stink.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.458
Stink! That's it!

15:32.866 --> 15:35.133
Come on, Max!
Fast as you can!

15:35.135 --> 15:38.036
Captain of the Guard:
This will take you
to the Prison Barge.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.271
You should be there
in three days time.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.973
-(horse whinnies)
-Rapunzel: Wait!

15:41.975 --> 15:43.675
-Hmm?
-Don't leave!

15:44.911 --> 15:46.044
Princess?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.180
Princess?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.953
(groans)
We can do it, Max!

15:54.955 --> 15:57.155
Princess,
we've been through this.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.325
I'm sorry, Captain,
but we're making
a huge mistake!

16:00.327 --> 16:02.627
I just want one more
chance, please!

16:14.274 --> 16:15.907
Captain of the Guard:
<i> Go! Go!</i>

16:15.909 --> 16:18.676
-You have two minutes.
-That's all I need.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.280
Captain, Attila did not
break into Monty's that night.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.848
Okay, so who did?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.416
No one.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.086
Huh?

16:28.088 --> 16:30.121
Rapunzel:
<i> Something bothered me</i>

16:30.122 --> 16:32.155
<i> about the broken pieces</i>
<i> of the door all over</i>
<i> the sidewalk.</i>

16:32.158 --> 16:35.159
<i> Why would they be outside</i>
<i> and not inside?</i>

16:35.161 --> 16:36.494
(rumbling)

16:36.496 --> 16:39.197
<i> It was like someone didn't</i>
<i> break into Monty's shop.</i>

16:39.199 --> 16:41.532
<i> More like...they broke out.</i>

16:41.534 --> 16:43.468
Captain of the Guard:
<i> That doesn't make</i>
<i> any sense.</i>

16:43.470 --> 16:45.636
Rapunzel:
<i>Yeah, I didn't think so either,</i>

16:45.638 --> 16:48.573
<i> until I noticed</i>
<i> that the door had a bell.</i>

16:49.709 --> 16:53.011
A bell? Princess,
where is this going?

16:53.013 --> 16:56.547
I believe
I can answer that!

16:56.549 --> 16:59.684
-Look what we found at Monty's.
-Just like you said, Raps.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.053
Great, who's next?
The mime?

17:02.055 --> 17:04.889
Two words, Admiral:

17:04.891 --> 17:06.691
sugar fairies.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.861
As if magical sugar fairies

17:09.863 --> 17:12.397
descended from the heavens.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.233
Shorty:
<i> I once lent a walnut</i>
<i> to a sugar fairy</i>

17:15.235 --> 17:17.402
<i> and she never returned it.</i>

17:17.404 --> 17:20.204
<i> So, I figured</i>
<i> Monty's sugar fairies</i>

17:20.206 --> 17:22.640
<i> might know how</i>
<i> I could get it back.</i>

17:22.642 --> 17:24.142
(goat bleats)

17:24.144 --> 17:26.411
<i> 'Course, it was about then,</i>

17:26.413 --> 17:29.013
<i> I remembered</i>
<i> it wasn't a sugar fairy</i>

17:29.015 --> 17:30.381
<i> that borrowed my walnut.</i>

17:31.518 --> 17:33.251
<i> It was a squirrel.</i>

17:33.253 --> 17:36.220
<i> And he returned it</i>
<i> two weeks ago.</i>

17:36.222 --> 17:38.389
<i> So, we ate.</i>

17:39.592 --> 17:40.892
<i> After our snack,</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:44.328
<i> Milton thought it would be</i>
<i> prudent to take a nap.</i>

17:44.330 --> 17:47.265
<i>I wholeheartedly concurred.</i>

17:49.202 --> 17:50.868
<i> But then...</i>

17:50.870 --> 17:53.438
<i> the bell rang.</i>

17:53.440 --> 17:56.074
(bleating angrily)

17:58.278 --> 17:59.677
Huh?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.414
(bleating)

18:10.590 --> 18:12.056
Luckily,

18:12.058 --> 18:14.459
I recall
Rapunzel's advice earlier

18:14.461 --> 18:16.527
and sought higher ground.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.795
(bleating)

18:17.797 --> 18:19.363
<i> Where I resumed</i>

18:19.365 --> 18:21.899
<i> the aforementioned nap.</i>

18:21.901 --> 18:23.868
(snoring quietly)

18:23.870 --> 18:26.771
(sniffs)
Wow, smell that?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.373
Something in here
really stinks, huh?

18:29.375 --> 18:30.908
That's why it smelled
so bad in there.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.577
I object!

18:32.579 --> 18:34.312
(sniffs)

18:34.314 --> 18:36.314
(coughing)

18:36.316 --> 18:38.049
Withdrawn.

18:38.051 --> 18:41.385
So the goat obliterated the door
from the inside?

18:41.387 --> 18:42.887
And where is this goat now?

18:42.889 --> 18:46.257
Oh... probably not too far.
Never is.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.226
(whistles)
Goat!

18:48.228 --> 18:49.494
(bleating)

18:52.665 --> 18:53.931
(bleating)

18:53.933 --> 18:56.601
You see, Captain.
It wasn't Attila's helmet

18:56.603 --> 18:58.569
that punctured
Monty's chocolate drum.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.439
It was Milton's horns!

19:01.441 --> 19:02.440
(slurps)

19:02.442 --> 19:05.443
Mmm. I love me some goat.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.346
Then why did we find stolen
recipes on Attila's boot?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.615
Those recipes
got tossed all over.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.350
Even onto the sidewalk.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.319
Attila must've stepped on one--
just like Pascal did--

19:15.321 --> 19:18.523
and then it came unstuck
back at his bakery.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.924
That's a bit of a stretch.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.827
Everyone who was near
the scene of the crime,
check your boots.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.899
-Captain?
-Huh?

19:29.802 --> 19:31.435
Oh.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.445
Uh, clearly there's been
a mistake.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.215
(clears throat)
Attila, you're free to go.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.083
(all cheering)

19:59.999 --> 20:02.466
I can't thank you enough,
Princess.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.536
Almost everyone
gave up on me,
except you.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.505
Aw. You're welcome.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.407
I guess when I really
believe in something,

20:09.409 --> 20:12.343
I don't give up on it.
Conviction.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.079
Hey, maybe conviction
can be the fifth "c."

20:15.081 --> 20:17.582
Yeah. Too bad
it starts on a K.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.519
-"Conviction" doesn't
start with a--
-Uhn-uh.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.387
Attila, can I ask you...

20:23.389 --> 20:25.923
where were you
that night anyway?

20:25.925 --> 20:27.992
(sighs)
You won't tell?

20:29.729 --> 20:33.497
Okay. I was afraid
Attila the Bun was a mistake.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.400
I don't know nuthin'
about runnin' a business,
Princess.

20:36.402 --> 20:40.104
I just wanna bake.
That's my dream.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.840
But everyone was so proud,

20:42.842 --> 20:45.443
and I didn't wanna
let anyone down.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.846
<i> So sometimes,</i>
<i> when I get stressed,</i>

20:48.848 --> 20:52.183
<i> I sneak out</i>
<i> to my bimberry patch</i>
<i> in the woods</i>

20:52.185 --> 20:54.418
<i> and I sing to 'em.</i>

20:54.420 --> 20:59.557
<i> ¶ La, la, la, la, la ¶</i>

20:59.559 --> 21:02.526
Well, your secret
is safe with me.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.263
It's just too bad
about the business part.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.232
If only there were someone
in Corona who could help out
with that.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.502
Hmm. I know just the person.

21:13.473 --> 21:17.208
And it is with great pleasure
I reintroduce to you

21:17.210 --> 21:19.110
Monty's Sweet Shoppe

21:19.112 --> 21:21.178
with Pastries by Attila!

21:22.148 --> 21:25.116
(all cheering)

21:25.118 --> 21:28.619
Here, Monty, I tracked down
all your recipes for you.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.155
-Hmm.
-Wait, are you still upset?

21:31.157 --> 21:32.490
Oh, no, son.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.326
It's these silly glasses
I'm always forgetting
to put on.

21:37.497 --> 21:41.666
Rapunzel,
I'm proud of the way
you represented Corona today.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.734
Thanks, Dad.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.904
Monty,
I can't thank you enough
for giving me this chance.

21:46.906 --> 21:50.408
It's what friends do.
Now come on, let's give you
the grand tour.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.343
I got new counters,
new shelves.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.578
-I even got a new door chime.
-Yeah, I see--

21:54.580 --> 21:56.580
Uh, wait a minute.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.149
Door chime?

21:58.151 --> 22:00.751
Hey, everybody.
Who wants a treat?

22:00.753 --> 22:02.620
-(bell rings)
-(crowd gasps)

22:02.622 --> 22:05.489
-(bleating angrily)
-Attila: Milton, no!

22:07.760 --> 22:10.594
(theme music playing)

22:10.596 --> 22:13.497
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes open</i>
<i> and wide ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:16.133
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:16.135 --> 22:18.302
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.304 --> 22:20.171
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.173 --> 22:23.007
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now,</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:23.009 --> 22:25.509
<i> ¶ Who I am,</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.511 --> 22:28.846
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.848 --> 22:32.650
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:32.652 --> 22:33.851
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:33.853 --> 22:36.220
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
