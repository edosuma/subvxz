00:01.043 --> 00:03.000
[Kendra] Previously on
Designated Survivor...

00:03.128 --> 00:05.039
The Times posted an editorial about

00:05.172 --> 00:07.413
the Administration's failure
to get to the bottom of the hack.

00:07.549 --> 00:08.880
Valeria Poreskova.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.966
-Who's she?
-My handler at the Russian Embassy.

00:11.094 --> 00:13.256
She was running my hacking investigation.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.766
| kKnow Damian came to see you
and I will find out why.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.052
[Valeria] It was about you.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.095
He asked me not to kill you.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.645
NASA was compromised.
So was the power grid.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.764
The coding signature was Alan Turing.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.312
Our group's badass had the handle Gamine.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.060
An anagram for enigma.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.607
[Dr. Louden] To do your job,
you need a clear head.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.231
If you bring unresolved emaotion
into the decisional--

00:33.367 --> 00:35.199
-I don't.
-Unintentionally, Tom.

00:35.327 --> 00:40.538
Tom Kirkman is experiencing a profound
grief over the loss of his wife

00:40.666 --> 00:44.250
-with associated decisional incapacity.
-[Lyor] What the hell is this?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.745
The recorded session notes
from the president's therapist.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.382
They were on his therapist's computer.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.340
It was hacked.
They're all over the Internet.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.301
The president's therapy was
a closely guarded secret.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.262
Yes, and most of the people who knew
about it are in this room

01:02.354 --> 01:04.015
The DC power grid, the space station,

01:04.147 --> 01:07.185
the president's therapy tapes,
it's all the same hacker, Gamine.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.398
Gamine had to be someone

01:08.527 --> 01:11.360
who knew he was seeing Dr. Louden,
meaning someone in this building.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.603
[Aaron] It's a very limited universe.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.197
Dr. Louden accessed the Oval
through the South Lawn.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.191
Few people in the West Wing
knew he was here.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.193
That's why we're vetting senior staff.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.117
IT has scanned your computers.
Nothing suspicious.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.956
'Cause none of us could have done this.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.870
Which is what the real hacker would say.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.244
We'll collect your phones,
do a quick scan,

01:28.380 --> 01:29.541
-make sure nobody's compromised.
-No.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.959
I'm not giving up my phone.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.832
Hmm, which is what
the real hacker would say.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.051
We have privacy rights. Kendra, tell him.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.763
We have no privacy rights. Warrantless searches
of government property are permissible.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.678
-Is that right?
-That's right.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.346
You heard her. Pony up, guys. Now.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.103
[Lyor] What about you three, huh?

01:50.235 --> 01:52.067
Who's investigating the investigators?

01:52.195 --> 01:54.186
The NSA director's already cleared us, Lyor.

01:54.323 --> 01:57.691
So you say, but I've seen No Way Out.
One of you could be Yuri.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.992
[Trey] She's a horticulturist,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.582
so I ask her if she knows
the origin of the kiwi,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.371
-'cause she's from Auckland.
-[Tom] Mm-hmm.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.085
She says New Zealand, I say China,

02:10.213 --> 02:14.958
which I know because I did an oral report
on the exotic fruit in second grade.

02:15.093 --> 02:15.924
Yeah.

02:16.053 --> 02:19.466
Then Jack Sprat and I flew into the clown
with a talking breadcrumb

02:19.598 --> 02:21.430
that we stole from abracadabra.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.350
Tom, you with me? Come on.
We have breakfast every Wednesday.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.937
-I feel like I'm eating with a mime.
-I'm sorry, Trey.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.890
To hell with whoever leaked the shrink tapes.

02:31.026 --> 02:35.270
Nobody cares if the president
goes to a therapist or a podiatrist.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.988
They only care about what you do
for the country, which is everything.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.778
People shouldn't be hearing this stuff.
They just shouldn't.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.699
Big brother, trust me.
This will blow over.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.116
[sighs]

02:45.248 --> 02:46.454
This isn't blowing over.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.496
It's been 12 hours
since his therapist tapes leaked.

02:49.628 --> 02:52.245
One thing's for sure, they demolish
the president's credibility.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.464
-[man] He's the patient-in-chief.
-[woman] No, he's human.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.503
692 of Americans aren't comfortable with--

02:57.636 --> 02:59.843
-[turns off TV]
-CNN, Fox, MSNBC.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.053
The front page of this morning's Times
and Post.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.889
-We need to respond, fast.
-[Emily sighs]

03:04.017 --> 03:07.226
A carefully worded statement
limiting his time with Dr. Louden

03:07.354 --> 03:10.187
to the aftermath of his wife's death.
Mr. President.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.272
Good morning.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.354
[sighs] I've already seen it.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.818
| don't think I need to remind you
that I started therapy

03:19.950 --> 03:21.861
because all of you asked me to.

03:21.993 --> 03:25.236
And you were right.
| needed it and it helped me.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.988
| won't stigmatize millions of Americans

03:28.125 --> 03:30.742
who use therapy productively
by apologizing for it.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.995
Agreed, but the public needs to know
that you're okay.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.338
-Maybe we can use a surrogate.
-[Lyor] That's good.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.924
Frieda Carlton, HHS secretary, is a shrink.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.885
She'll issue a statement of support
lauding your bravery for seeking help.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.381
The APA can underscore the importance
of therapy for people in need.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.929
The president will designate
a National Mental Health Day.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.142
No, he won't.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.274
I'm fine with a show of support,

03:52.399 --> 03:55.733
but I am over having
my private business aired in public.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.398
What I want to know is
how we stop this from happening again.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.192
-We're working on it.
-I'm assuming this is part of the larger hack.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.577
I'm afraid so. Hannah and her team
are running it down.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.692
| want this dealt with,

04:04.828 --> 04:07.195
and everybody must cooperate
with the investigation.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.705
-Yes, sir.
-We've got work to do.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.994
What's on the schedule?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.083
I'm meeting with Senator Cowling
about the energy bill.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.077
Kendra's vetting a DC Circuit nominee,

04:15.213 --> 04:18.422
and Aaron's got a sit-down with Ambassador Woo
about the joint anti-terrorism task force.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.915
And the national science fair.

04:20.051 --> 04:23.464
That's today.
I'm supposed to judge that with Dr. Frost.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.134
| know, but public appearances
will be a challenge.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.382
We need to keep you
locked away from reporters.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.681
By that, I'm not suggesting
those seeing mental health professionals.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.803
Thank you, Lyor.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.689
Let's get to work.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.479
Didn't we reach an agreement
with the Energy Subcommittee?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.068
We made a few changes.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.360
A few? You've slashed hydropower funding,
killed local subsidies...

04:43.492 --> 04:46.905
The committee's reconsidered
its positions, given recent events.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.746
Mr. Dakich, he wants
to nominate you to the DC Circuit,

04:50.874 --> 04:52.080
a feeder to the Supreme Court.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.667
-And I am honored.
-So why turn it down?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.787
I'm concerned about the president's
recent challenges.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.163
The therapist tapes.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.132
Yes. I could be tainted by association.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.003
And if my nomination gets killed,
| won't get another chance.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.130
-Not with this president you won't.
-I understand.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.634
But I'm still in my 50s.
There will be other presidents.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.263
-It's a renewal of a joint security pact.
-I understand.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.140
Why refuse to issue a statement
about our cooperation

05:18.276 --> 05:19.607
in pursuing terrorist organizations?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.945
In my culture,
mental iliness is a taboo subject.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.314
The president is not mentally ill.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.862
The point is, Emily, it's about leverage.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.371
We have it. You don't.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.408
It's about my career. I can't risk it.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.534
It's about confidence in
who we're doing business with.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.085
Yeah.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.879
-Dr. Louden, thank you for coming.
-Of course.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.507
Uh, yeah, the president will be with you.
| just wanted to have a word first.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.386
| can only discuss
the content of the tapes with the patient.

05:55.522 --> 05:59.481
You understand that we're facing
a huge perception problem, right?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.941
Americans can't think
their president isn't fit to govern.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.153
-I never said that.
-I understand. But that's how it's playing.

06:05.282 --> 06:09.401
So how would you feel about issuing
some kind of public clarification?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.324
Inappropriate. Look, I know this is bad
for the president.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.708
It's also bad for me and my reputation.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.165
| shouldn't have to clarify something
that wasn't meant for the public.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.537
Exactly.
Your words were taken out of context.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.413
They were merely a snapshot in time,

06:22.549 --> 06:25.667
a picture of a president whose mental health
has since rapidly improved.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.338
-Lyor.
-It has improved, right?

06:27.470 --> 06:30.132
You're an excellent therapist.
He's been under your continual care.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.180
It's improved.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.516
So give the public a more complete picture.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.760
That's all I'm asking, all right?

06:38.857 --> 06:40.723
-I'll be back in 40 minutes.
-[door opens]

06:41.693 --> 06:42.774
[door closes]

06:43.653 --> 06:47.396
While we look for a conspirator in the White
House, I wonder where Damian Rennett is.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.115
He's running down a lead
that could help us ID the hacker.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.745
You trust him to do that alone?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.157
| trust that we're his only options.

06:54.289 --> 06:58.078
Especially after you told him
that he's clear if he helps ID Gamine.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.166
This doesn't give me the warm fuzzies, Hannah.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.787
You're preaching to the choir, Aaron.
You dumped him on me.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.632
| get it. And he already gave us
the Turing lead that put us on to Gamine.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.377
I'm just reminding you
not to give him too much rope.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.507
Just enough to hang himself.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.238
[speaking Russian]

07:37.374 --> 07:40.332
[in English] English.
| don't work for you anymore.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.701
Everything the FSB has on Gamine.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.253
Pool it with your intel,
see if it yields anything.

07:48.385 --> 07:53.425
If it does, Moscow would appreciate
a heads-up on Gamine's identity

07:53.556 --> 07:57.265
before you discuss it
with your new American friends.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.431
Like I said, I don't work for you--

07:59.562 --> 08:03.521
For Moscow. Yes, you work for America.

08:03.650 --> 08:08.235
What do you think America will do to you
when this hacking investigation is over?

08:08.363 --> 08:09.569
That's between me and them.

08:10.407 --> 08:13.570
I'll tell you. They'll make you disappear.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.242
For good.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.236
-Just like you would.
-No.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.790
You are still valuable,
because when this is over,

08:21.918 --> 08:25.786
you will have learned
much about America you can share.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.584
Maybe you can share enough
to keep yourself alive.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.847
What I need from you right now is a clean bill
of health.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.341
[sighs] We've been at this for months.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.970
You're making good progress,
but you're not all the way back.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.347
But the fact is, my behaviour,
every single thing I'm doing

08:45.483 --> 08:47.394
is being viewed through the prism
of your words.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.144
And I think your continued actions
will speak louder than my words,

08:50.280 --> 08:51.486
and you're doing fine.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.322
My psyche is being publicly autopsied.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.489
| don't know where the next cut
is coming from. And that's not fair.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.203
No, it's not.
And I wish there was something I could do.

09:00.331 --> 09:03.574
-Sorry, sir, Aaron Shore needs to see you.
-I'll show myself out.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.828
You may as well stay, Dr. Louden.
This involves you.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.125
[newscaster] Another tape,
another bombshell,

09:09.257 --> 09:12.090
striking at the core
of the president's fitness

09:12.218 --> 09:13.879
to hold the highest office in the land.

09:14.012 --> 09:16.925
[Dr. Louden on recording] Patient
continues to suffer anxiety and depression

09:17.057 --> 09:20.015
from the destruction of the Capitol
and his wife's death.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.975
The shock of processing these tragedies

09:22.103 --> 09:25.061
has led to a variant
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.555
PTSD?

09:26.691 --> 09:30.776
It was a provisional diagnosis,
meant for internal reference only.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.895
How many hours of these tapes are there?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.147
-All told, perhaps seven.
-Seven?

09:36.076 --> 09:36.941
[sighs]

09:37.077 --> 09:39.284
So this is only the beginning.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.416
[theme music playing]

09:54.761 --> 09:56.718
-[reporter] What about his mental state?
-[reporters clamoring]

09:56.846 --> 10:00.384
People, listen.
Read Dr. Louden's statement, okay?

10:00.517 --> 10:03.555
He never said the president
wasn't fit for the job.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.064
He said the president
has decisional incapacity.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.978
"Had," in the immediate aftermath of his wife's
death. That diagnosis is three months old.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.271
What about the PTSD?

10:11.402 --> 10:15.066
He doesn't have PTSD either.
He has a variant of PTSD... Had.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.939
[reporters clamoring]

10:18.243 --> 10:21.986
| feel like Nero saying Rome isn't burning
while everything is on fire.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.112
Enough with the metaphors.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.580
It's a simile. Here's a metaphor:
The ship is sinking.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.665
-Hmm, then no worries about a fire.
-Seriously?

10:27.794 --> 10:31.082
Keep it together.
You can't fall apart like our initiatives.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.171
But give me more to work with.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.293
We're waiting for a statement of support
from the HHS secretary.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.680
[Seth] I'd belt-and-suspenders this.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.888
[Emily] I've already called the
VP's office for her public backing.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.222
[cell phone beeps]

10:44.060 --> 10:45.095
-Oh, boy.
-[sighs]

10:45.228 --> 10:46.764
[Dr. Louden on recording]
Patient has had an inability

10:46.896 --> 10:48.978
to connect with anyone
since his wife's death,

10:49.107 --> 10:52.099
with the notable exception of his friendship
with Andrea Frost,

10:52.235 --> 10:55.023
-which I believe will have salutary effects.
-[recording stops]

10:55.155 --> 10:57.271
[inhales sharply]
It's the latest tape leak.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.114
It'll be everywhere in about ten minutes.

10:59.242 --> 11:02.075
How does this indict his mental health?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.864
It's worse. It indicts his morality.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.113
Critics will say he's trivializing
his emotional difficulties.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.286
By trying to get laid
while he's working things out.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.533
That's a stretch.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.788
Is it? You've seen what Frost looks like.
How would you spin this for clickbait?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.210
This is like rifling through
your dad's drawers.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.255
No, it's like reading your dad's diary
and once you've read it, that's it.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.379
-Focus on the problem at hand, please.
-The many problems? Sure.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.803
Andrea Frost is in the West Wing. I'll make
sure the president gives her a heads up.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.347
Good. And where the heck is the cavalry?

11:28.479 --> 11:31.312
Why aren't administration figures
defending our guy's fitness?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.227
Cabinet's keeping its head down
until this blows over.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.693
Somebody has to defend him.
Even the postmaster general.

11:38.364 --> 11:42.107
Andrea, so nice to see you.
How's everything going with the science fair?

11:42.243 --> 11:46.487
Amazing. A ten-year-old is using VR
to demonstrate Schrodinger's cat paradox.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.534
Wow. [chuckles]

11:48.666 --> 11:51.374
When I was ten years old,
| was learning how to spell "paradox.”

11:51.502 --> 11:53.994
You'll be proud to see
what the next generation is up to.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.498
Unfortunately, I'll have to read about it.
Given my present circumstances,

11:57.634 --> 12:01.093
my staff thinks making myself available
to the press right now is

12:01.221 --> 12:02.552
maybe not such a good idea.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.802
How are you doing, Tom?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.141
Oh...

12:09.687 --> 12:11.189
I'm pretty embarrassed.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.353
It's like being stripped naked
and forced to run through the schoolyard.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.567
Don't worry about the science fair.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.732
I'll fly the flag for the both of us.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.740
There is something else. Apparently,
a few more tapes have been released.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.281
I'm not exactly sure what's on them,
but I may have talked about you.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.450
Nothing inappropriate, but...

12:31.417 --> 12:33.670
[sighs] ...people gossip.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.165
| won't take offense.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.419
Thank you for being so understanding.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.134
Hey, maybe you could bring
the winner of the science fair here.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.755
| could show them the Oval Office,
the West Wing.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.597
That would be wonderful.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.099
Okay. [chuckles]

12:51.229 --> 12:52.845
[Chuck] That's the last of the devices.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.058
So, no one in the President's inner circle
has any link to Gamine?

12:57.193 --> 12:59.651
Nope. Everybody in the White House
checks out.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.988
We're looking for somebody who was close enough
to him to know he was in therapy.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.574
-Right, but not a White House employee.
-What about visitors?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.615
Someone in the White House
on days he had a session.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.908
Yes, who has close proximity to the Oval.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.031
The visitor logs are digitized.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.043
-I'll scour them.
-Fast as you can, Chuck.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.002
I'm leaving another message.
Listen very carefully.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.502
Tell the vice president
Lyor Boone must speak with her urgently.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.718
Oh, no, thank you.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.092
[knock at door]
-Yup.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.967
-I have tried the entire cabinet.
| can't reach any secretary.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.810
They're dodging us. Cowards.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.975
Actually, I think they're busy.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.690
My friend at the OEOB

13:38.818 --> 13:41.685
says the cabinet's been meeting
with Vice President Darby all morning.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.902
That doesn't make sense.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.523
There's no pending issue that would require
the entire cabinet...

13:50.455 --> 13:51.445
Oh, my God.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.785
Out of my way. Move it!

14:00.923 --> 14:02.209
-We need to see the president.
-Why?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.503
The VP's meeting with the cabinet.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.092
-Which members?
-[Lyor] All of them. Move out of my way!

14:09.432 --> 14:10.263
[all panting]

14:10.391 --> 14:12.177
-What's going on?
-[Emily] A coup, sir.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.426
You need to speak
with the vice president right now.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.061
Get me the vice president, please.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.230
What do you mean, the cabinet voted
to have me removed?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.194
The majority of the cabinet, sir.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.279
They're invoking the 25th Amendment, Section 4.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.024
Which allows the president
to be ousted on the basis of--

14:29.160 --> 14:31.868
Mental incapacity. I know!
What evidence do you have?

14:31.996 --> 14:34.408
Some illegally-obtained recordings
from my therapist,

14:34.540 --> 14:37.123
-which no one should have heard?
-But we have heard them, sir.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.418
They raise justifiable concerns
about your decision-making

14:40.546 --> 14:42.412
-since your wife's death.
-My decision-making?

14:42.548 --> 14:45.040
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you were standing
right next to me

14:45.176 --> 14:46.382
in Command Ops when you said

14:46.511 --> 14:49.549
my decision to send
the Navy Seals into Kunami was right?

14:49.680 --> 14:50.670
This is ridiculous!

14:50.807 --> 14:52.343
We've drafted a letter to Congress.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.341
Upon its delivery,
you'll be removed from office.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.184
-And you'll become president.
-Yes, sir.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.303
Then why in the hell
are we having this discussion?

14:58.439 --> 15:00.771
-Have you signed the letter yet?
-No.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.392
And the cabinet's vote remains unratified
until you do.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.110
Yes. I wanted to speak to you first.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.605
The time to speak to me was
before the cabinet convened.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.901
And you damn well know it!

15:09.033 --> 15:11.900
| could not do that, sir.
The process demands secrecy.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.368
Once it's in motion, yes.
But not before.

15:14.497 --> 15:18.991
You, my vice-president, had every opportunity to
express your concerns to me

15:19.127 --> 15:21.835
-before your orchestrated this crap!
-I understand you're upset.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.170
-Do you?
-Yes, sir, I do.

15:24.715 --> 15:29.380
| think you deserve to present your case
as to why you should be retained.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.173
If you choose not to do so,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.506
| will proceed as planned.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.977
Explain to me exactly
what does this opportunity entail?

15:39.105 --> 15:42.018
There is someone
who can explain it better than I can.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.184
[indistinct chatter]

15:51.701 --> 15:52.486
[man chuckles]

15:56.998 --> 15:57.863
Mr. President.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.619
Ethan West.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.040
I've been looking forward to meeting you
for a very long time.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.088
A hearing?

16:15.558 --> 16:16.923
There's no blueprint for this,

16:17.059 --> 16:20.518
so let's call it a confidential inquiry
where the cabinet elicits facts

16:20.646 --> 16:23.308
relevant to a fuller understanding
of their 25th Amendment mission.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.684
The idea here, sir, is to give you
an opportunity to explain yourself,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.401
so we can make the right decision.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.523
The cabinet has asked me
to facilitate their fact-finding mission.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.241
-Meaning you're the prosecutor.
-[Darby] That's a bit pejorative.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.703
Mr. West is a former Supreme Court clerk,
US attorney,

16:38.831 --> 16:40.868
solicitor general and law professor.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.958
He's currently the managing partner
of West and Farris,

16:44.086 --> 16:46.794
the most prestigious legal boutique
in the city

16:46.923 --> 16:50.507
and his reputation for impartiality
is unquestioned.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.626
I'm merely an instrument of justice,
nothing more.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.754
What rules govern
this impartial fact-finding mission?

16:55.890 --> 16:58.507
[West] It's simple: the White House produces
witnesses and documents.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.350
And you, sir, you answer my questions.

17:00.478 --> 17:03.061
The president will need some time
to consider his involvement.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.054
Absolutely.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.056
If I choose not to participate?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.310
Then I send the cabinet's letter
and send it to Congress.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.185
And you no longer work in this office.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.030
Which would be a shame,
because I love what you've done with it.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.240
Federal-era modern with a Georgian flair.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.694
Oh, sir, you wouldn't mind
if I sat at the Resolute desk, would you?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.118
Uh, maybe another time.

17:29.966 --> 17:34.506
-Well, it's an inquisition, sir.
-It's a setup to varnish a coup.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.173
West has never lost a case, sir.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.558
He's the last person
we want to face off against.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.471
| agree. If any of one have any bright ideas,
I'm all ears.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.972
Then I suggest we make the most
of this opportunity in front of us.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.602
Kendra, I want as many concessions as you can.
| don't expect an even playing field,

17:51.737 --> 17:54.274
but it'd be nice if we weren't running
straight uphill.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.442
Yes, sir.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.912
These document requests go all the way back
to Kirkman's swearing-in.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.872
- I believe in thoroughness.
-And fishing expeditions, right?

18:05.001 --> 18:07.242
Your witness list includes
every senior staff member.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.244
| may not call them.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.121
You expect the president
to produce his therapist?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.089
[West] You make it sound
like a magic trick.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.754
-Doctor-patient privilege.
-Let me explain something.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.548
This is not a legal proceeding.
The normal rules don't apply.

18:18.681 --> 18:22.800
I've decided there are no guidelines,
to avoid hindering our search for truth.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.346
Can the president put on a case?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.389
He can cross-examine my witnesses.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.887
<i>Can we call and rebuttal witnesses”?</i>

18:28.024 --> 18:29.765
They'll only obscure
the proceeding of this mission.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.891
Fine. Just know
that if the president is removed,

18:32.028 --> 18:33.939
we'll go public about your rigged hearing,

18:34.071 --> 18:35.653
which will delegitimize
Darby's administration.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.899
And I'll be on CNN talking about
Ethan West and his star chamber,

18:39.035 --> 18:41.652
which will delegitimize you.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.744
Aright, I'll give you a couple of witnesses.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.625
[scoffs]

18:46.709 --> 18:49.292
And we need to keep pounding
those talking points to the press.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.833
-Yep, therapy good, hacking bad.
-The president is a victim, not a problem.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.799
I'll talk to OPE. If the public backs him,
then we can pressure the cabinet,

18:56.927 --> 18:57.678
limit their mobility.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.794
[Emily] We need to make sure the staff
are bulletproof,

18:59.930 --> 19:03.059
that nothing any of us has done
could negatively impact the president,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.641
or make his ouster more likely.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.269
Is there something I need to know?

19:08.397 --> 19:09.853
[Emily sighs]

19:12.068 --> 19:15.561
Remember when Moss was revealed
as the leaker of classified information?

19:15.696 --> 19:17.687
-Yeah.
- I fed the media that story.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.200
-You what?
-It gets worse.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.941
| found out that Moss was the culprit

19:21.077 --> 19:23.239
because I asked Chuck
to hack Simon Day's phone.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.283
Did you also shoot Archduke Ferdinand
and start global warming?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.125
-Seth...
-You're laundering evidence

19:31.253 --> 19:33.119
that you instructed a subordinate
to obtain illegally.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.041
| was trying to protect the president.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.165
By doing your best
G. Gordon Liddy impersonation?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.384
The point is he is now fighting
for his political life, and what I did--

19:40.513 --> 19:43.096
Could make him look
paranoid, mentally unfit.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.342
Yes, if people think that
| was doing his bidding for him.

19:46.477 --> 19:50.015
So if I really want to protect him...

19:51.315 --> 19:53.602
Oh, you'd resign before the proceeding.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.816
Emily, meet sword. Sword, Emily.

19:55.945 --> 19:56.980
Okay, two things.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.320
One, did you have your brain
surgically removed?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.735
And two, don't do anything
before you talk to Kendra.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.110
You've made enough decisions as it is,
and all of them have been bad.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.827
[Emily] What I instructed you to do
on the leak investigation

20:13.963 --> 20:16.546
is going to be a problem for the president,
not for you.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.958
I'm the one who told you to dump
phone records without a warrant.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.335
-But I didn't do that.
-Don't protect me.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.680
I'm not. I found another way
to identify the leaker, a legit way.

20:25.808 --> 20:26.673
How?

20:26.809 --> 20:30.552
| sweet-talked Simon Day's assistant
into showing me his calendar.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.430
The night before one his stories broke,
he was at the Capital Club.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.601
The private joint in Georgetown?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.271
Yes. And I got their desk clerk to show me
the visitor log.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.565
All three journalists who reported
on the leaked information

20:39.697 --> 20:43.691
were signed in by President Moss' assistant
the night before their stories broke.

20:43.826 --> 20:44.577
Jonathan Willax.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.444
Yes, meaning I didn't break any laws
to figure out Moss was behind this.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.820
And neither did you.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.037
[chuckles softly]

20:51.167 --> 20:53.249
You showed much better judgment
than I did, Chuck.

20:54.003 --> 20:54.913
Thank you.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.000
Can I be candid?

20:59.717 --> 21:00.707
Of course.

21:00.843 --> 21:05.838
I'm not just some drone in the basement
who toils away on algorithms.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.472
Well, I am, but I can do other stuff.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.431
Help the White House.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.017
I'll remember that.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.573
Kendra, tell me you can stop this hearing.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.942
| don't think we can, sir, but we can stack it.

21:28.078 --> 21:28.943
How?

21:29.079 --> 21:33.198
For the loyalists to gain the majority,
you'll have to fire two cabinet members.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.625
These are the eight people who want you gone.

21:35.753 --> 21:36.834
How'd you draw the battle lines?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.750
Spoke to all 15 offices
after our meeting with the VP,

21:39.882 --> 21:41.964
only 7 committed
to public statements of support.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.302
Emily?

21:43.886 --> 21:46.674
| don't like it, sir.
They'll figure out why they got fired.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.138
And you know
who gets rid of political enemies?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.720
-Dictators.
-[Lyor] Sir...

21:53.229 --> 21:55.311
your enemies aren't showing scruples,
why should you?

21:55.439 --> 21:58.977
Because I'm the president
and I respect the office.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.818
We're not gonna fire anybody.
That's not how we're gonna win this.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.152
[indistinct chatter]

22:07.284 --> 22:10.117
[West] The food here is horrible.
Why aren't we at the White House?

22:10.246 --> 22:11.577
[Lyor] That's the sanctum sanctorum.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.621
| wasn't about to let you desecrate it again.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.671
Oh, a dossier?

22:18.796 --> 22:22.380
You were investigated by the DC bar
for ethics violations three times.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.624
-And cleared three times.
-Two bankruptcy filings.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.297
Made some bad investments.
I'm a dreamer.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.921
Treasury Secretary Wallins
is your college roommate.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.139
-That's a coincidence.
-Yeah, I don't think so.

22:32.268 --> 22:36.387
The public will react to a mercenary who
solicited a job to remove the president.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.308
The public will react to a lot of things.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.812
Every dirty trick you ever pulled
and every unsavory client you ever represented.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.904
After this, you'll be as marketable as

22:47.032 --> 22:48.989
a one-legged man
in an ass-kicking contest.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.574
-You're not gonna win this.
-I am.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.537
You know why? Because I'm a predator,
and right now, my quarry's scared.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.407
Then only thing that scares me is irrelevance.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.409
And right now, I'm the most relevant man
in Washington.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.788
I'll take this is for my collection.
He'll take the check.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.264
[Carson] What is it then that would you like
to tell the American people, sir?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.303
That their president is fine,

23:15.811 --> 23:18.894
and [, like anybody else,
am a work in progress.

23:19.023 --> 23:22.357
But there is absolutely nothing on those tapes
that they need to be concerned about.

23:22.484 --> 23:25.897
Respectfully, sir, we're sitting here
because of that concern.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.067
It's the suggestion
that you are not equipped

23:28.198 --> 23:30.610
to handle the most difficult job in the world.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.111
Respectfully, Carson, I've listened
to the tapes, and that was not suggested.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.079
"Depression,
difficulty processing tragedy--"

23:37.207 --> 23:39.164
| don't deny having gone through all of that.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.785
Then why should the public
have confidence in you?

23:41.921 --> 23:44.879
Because I've gone through all of that
and I've come out the other end,

23:45.507 --> 23:47.794
and am still serving the American people.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.841
| would like to add to that,
and I believe this very strongly,

23:52.723 --> 23:56.432
since my wife's tragic death,
| have served the American people...

23:56.560 --> 23:58.517
Setting this up was a good idea.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.428
He's doing just fine.

24:01.023 --> 24:01.888
So far.

24:02.024 --> 24:06.143
We're not defined by our difficulties,
but by how we respond to them.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.780
My response was to fight.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.730
And I will continue to do that.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.200
| will fight on behalf
of the American people.

24:14.870 --> 24:18.158
-It wasn't that bad.
-[sighs] But we needed "great."

24:18.290 --> 24:19.826
Split decisions won't sway the cabinet.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.040
We'll take our swings.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.535
In a hearing without due process,
against a ruthless adversary

24:23.671 --> 24:25.628
who what born for this moment?
Look around.

24:25.756 --> 24:26.996
It's like @ morgue in here.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.500
Everyone who's heard those tapes
knows where we stand.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.842
You know it, too.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.429
[Chuck] Thirty-four people unaffiliated
with the White House

24:34.556 --> 24:38.550
met the president in the Oval just prior to,
or after, his shrink sessions.

24:38.686 --> 24:42.099
We have to cross-reference those names
with Damian's intel.

24:42.231 --> 24:46.600
Lots of anti-government diatribes
by Gamine on obscure chat boards.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.645
Which we already know.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.985
[Hannah] Chuck, what's this?
I've seen the number a few times.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.405
-Nine digits.
-Social security, maybe?

24:56.787 --> 24:57.948
Nope.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.697
Bank routing numbers?
They're nine digits, right?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.244
[typing]

25:03.669 --> 25:04.500
[beeping]

25:05.170 --> 25:05.921
Bingo.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.754
This routing number was used
to buy Turing memorabilia.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.544
Account's registered to a Mia Eng.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.508
An anagram for enigma,
as in Turing's Enigma machine.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.052
Or Gamine.
Can you track the purchases?

25:20.102 --> 25:20.853
[typing]

25:22.604 --> 25:24.811
Whoa. Lots of activity, all at auctions.

25:24.940 --> 25:30.151
A Turing machine in Paris in May 2016,
Turing's spectacles in London in May 2017,

25:30.279 --> 25:33.237
and here's a March 2018 purchase,
an old Turing notebook.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.198
An auction house called Candleton and Sons
in Baltimore.

25:37.286 --> 25:38.526
We're getting closer.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.916
Ah, yes, here it is.
A Turing notebook, circa 1944.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.753
-Oh, that's the one.
-It was sold two months ago.

25:48.881 --> 25:49.837
Ah.

25:49.965 --> 25:53.174
Disappointing.
My wife is a Turing connoisseur.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.087
I'm sorry.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.836
The good news is there's a big market
for Turing memorabilia.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.306
Something is sure to come up
for sale soon.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.181
Is it possible to give me
the buyer's personal information

26:04.313 --> 26:06.054
so I can make a private offer?

26:06.190 --> 26:07.351
That's not possible.

26:07.483 --> 26:11.568
Uh, people patronize Candleton and Sons
because we safeguard client information.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.606
Yeah, we understand.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.357
Next time it comes on the market,
| suggest you move fast.

26:17.493 --> 26:18.858
-We will.
-[Damian] Mmm.

26:18.994 --> 26:19.825
I'm sorry.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.455
You know what, honey, let's move on

26:21.580 --> 26:24.288
and focus on who we're going to sell
our Hirst collection to.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.531
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry?

26:26.210 --> 26:29.248
Oh, we've decided to de-accession
our modernist works,

26:29.379 --> 26:31.757
focus on abstract impressionism.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.715
But we need an auction house
that's gonna prize our business.

26:34.843 --> 26:38.177
-Let's just keep looking.
-Let me see what I can do.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.758
-[knock at door]
-Yep, this better be good news.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.145
[chuckles softly]

26:47.689 --> 26:49.817
-Mr. President.
-Sorry for dropping in like this.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.524
| just wanted to have a word.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.112
-Of course.
-We're in a tough spot.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.822
Yeah, we are.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.363
| know everyone's doing
everything they can to cauterize this thing.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.826
Yeah, all they can.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.118
- I don't think the bleeding will stop soon.
-Neither do I.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.456
What do you advise?

27:07.584 --> 27:11.373
| think there are battles you lose
even if you win.

27:11.839 --> 27:12.749
Explain.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.918
Let's say Kendra
pulls a rabbit out of a hat.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.883
You guys convince your cabinet
that you're competent.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.469
Some malcontent is still gonna leak
the fact that there was a hearing,

27:20.597 --> 27:21.553
which will cripple your presidency.

27:21.682 --> 27:22.922
And if I lose?

27:23.058 --> 27:26.096
If you lose,
you'll leave this building in ignominy,

27:26.895 --> 27:28.852
your name forever blighted
in the history books,

27:28.981 --> 27:30.016
your legacy tainted.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.890
-Do you see another option?
-Well...

27:32.901 --> 27:35.643
| do. You're not a politician, sir.

27:36.822 --> 27:37.812
You're a teacher.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.314
[sighs]

27:41.493 --> 27:43.450
You think I should just walk away.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.445
Of course not!
You wouldn't be walking away.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.289
You were a caretaker,
brought in to right the ship,

27:48.417 --> 27:50.328
a limited purpose mission
which you accomplished.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.248
We spin it right, you'll be a hero.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.506
You are a hero, sir,
and we can't let people forget that.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.009
Thank you.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.423
[door opens]

28:05.434 --> 28:06.549
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.642
So, what's the latest?

28:08.770 --> 28:11.102
-Down to the quarterfinals.
-Good.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.189
You don't seem good.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.436
I'm not sure I even remember
what good feels like.

28:18.155 --> 28:18.906
Tom?

28:20.699 --> 28:21.609
[sighs]

28:25.204 --> 28:28.742
| became president under
the worst of all possible circumstances.

28:30.292 --> 28:34.251
| was supposed to be there that night,
the night of the Capitol bombing.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.376
| was supposed to die that night,
along with everyone else...

28:40.302 --> 28:41.463
but I didn't.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.713
| thought maybe fate put me in this position

28:44.848 --> 28:48.512
because I was supposed
to really lead, you know?

28:48.644 --> 28:50.226
Do something great.

28:52.314 --> 28:54.726
[chuckles softly] But who's kidding who?

28:56.401 --> 28:57.812
I've never been that guy.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.561
That's not true.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.654
All I've got now is, uh...

29:04.034 --> 29:05.149
...Is my children.

29:06.328 --> 29:11.073
And in the end, they are the ones who've
really suffered through all of this.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.700
-Your kids will get through this.
-Maybe.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.001
But why should they have to?

29:18.548 --> 29:21.040
Honestly,
| don't know if I can do this anymore.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.752
You're the only one who can answer that, Tom.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.929
But if you ever need someone to listen,
| am always here for you.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.479
Thank you.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.775
-You should get back to the science fair.
-Yeah. [clears throat]

29:40.904 --> 29:42.360
You sure you're gonna be all right?

29:42.906 --> 29:46.069
Yeah. I'm sorry for
unloading on you like that.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.282
Don't be.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.118
-We'll talk later?
-Yeah.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.002
-[reporters clamoring]
-I'm updating you

30:06.138 --> 30:07.594
on the Administration's business initiatives.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.930
-The tech summit is next week--
-Come on, Seth.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.470
--And you should have
copies of the latest tax plan.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.434
What about the latest therapy tapes?

30:14.563 --> 30:18.352
The president sat with Carson Kramer today
and has nothing more to say.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.225
-That's all.
-[reporters clamoring]

30:22.487 --> 30:24.148
No, I have one more thing to say.

30:26.325 --> 30:30.068
You know, Tom Kirkman
has given everything to his country,

30:31.413 --> 30:32.619
even his wife.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.039
Now he's being torn apart

30:36.168 --> 30:39.160
because he's self-aware enough
to seek professional help?

30:39.796 --> 30:41.503
Judge him if you want to.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.665
History will judge you.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.549
[indistinct chatter]

30:47.262 --> 30:48.252
Our boy's good.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.965
| never thought I'd be relieved
we're talking about therapy tapes.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.387
The alternative's the 25th Amendment.
Relief is appropriate.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.304
[cell phone rings]

30:55.437 --> 30:58.054
Emily-- He what?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.476
I'll cut him off at the pass.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.224
-President's going to the science fair.
-What?

31:01.360 --> 31:04.728
-Sir, you can't go to the fair.
-And yet, I am.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.524
But there'll be reporters.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.988
With microphones, pens and agendas.

31:09.117 --> 31:12.075
Carson Kramer was one thing,
but an unscripted public appearance?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.740
-It'll be a feeding frenzy.
-Yeah.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.489
I'm still the president,
and as long as I am,

31:16.625 --> 31:19.037
and I'm not gonna spend my time hiding,
understood?

31:19.169 --> 31:20.204
[both] Yes, sir.

31:20.337 --> 31:23.170
[reporter] Dr. Frost, are you and the president
romantically involved?

31:23.298 --> 31:25.335
Yes, we both love science.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.879
What's your reaction to being discussed
in a therapy session?

31:28.011 --> 31:31.675
| really wish that we could focus on what
these extraordinary minds are doing.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.842
[Tom] So do I.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.054
The question you all should be asking is,

31:36.186 --> 31:39.349
"Who in that room is gonna be
the next Dr. Andrea Frost?"

31:39.481 --> 31:43.190
Someone who's not only my friend,
and patented her first invention at 15,

31:43.318 --> 31:45.810
from her mom's basement.
Any questions about that?

31:47.030 --> 31:50.022
Then you'll have to excuse us.
We have a competition to judge. Dr.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.407
Can I address the elephant in the room?

31:56.540 --> 31:59.282
Yes, the animatronics exhibit
is right over there.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.910
I'm talking about what I said
during my therapy sessions.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.663
| know, but you've
already explained and...

32:05.799 --> 32:09.542
| know, but I don't think I did it very well.
And I'd like to get this right.

32:09.678 --> 32:13.512
| did tell Dr. Louden that we were friends,
but I told him more.

32:14.349 --> 32:15.259
[, um...

32:16.393 --> 32:20.853
| told him that I thought
you were special, and you are.

32:21.523 --> 32:24.606
But I told him that
in the context of me feeling guilty...

32:25.694 --> 32:27.105
because I'm still...

32:27.237 --> 32:30.650
Well, my wife is still
a huge part of my life, and...

32:30.782 --> 32:33.740
Tom, I don't want you to worry.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.705
You're a good man,

32:37.914 --> 32:41.032
and I consider it a privilege
to be able to call you my friend.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.617
The privilege is mine.

32:47.549 --> 32:50.541
More therapist's tapes just dropped.
We need to find this hacker now.

32:50.677 --> 32:54.045
Purchaser is Mia Eng,
no phone number or business address.

32:54.181 --> 32:55.797
It had to be delivered somewhere.

32:55.932 --> 32:59.175
<i>Yeah, a club in Potomac, Shady Elms.</i>

32:59.311 --> 33:02.224
Yeah, I know it.
We're about 40 minutes out.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.608
We're gonna solve this, Hannah.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.724
The two of us, working together.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.810
Whatever else may be true,
we always made a good team.

33:10.530 --> 33:14.114
Where did you get the bank number
you brought in today?

33:14.242 --> 33:16.199
It was a cyber-security contact--

33:16.328 --> 33:18.820
-Valeria Poreskova?
-How do you know that?

33:18.955 --> 33:22.493
Because I had you followed.
I'm not stupid enough to trust you again.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.624
If I'd told you I was going to meet Valeria,
would you have let me?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.997
Without her,
we wouldn't be close to solving this.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.510
You better hope her intel pays off,

33:31.635 --> 33:33.717
because if it doesn't,
this will be your last move.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.131
-Hannah...
-Don't.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.849
[Tom] Wow, this is great.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.684
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

33:42.812 --> 33:44.268
Great. What have you got?

33:44.397 --> 33:48.482
Transformation of a paramecium
by microinjection of a serotype gene.

33:48.610 --> 33:51.819
-He cloned it. [chuckles]
-I got it, I think.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.813
-May |?
-Yeah, for sure.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.946
[Tom] And fire!

33:59.955 --> 34:01.616
-Wow!
-[Andrea] Great shot, Billy.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.365
[Tom] Secret Service know you brought in
a cannon into the White House?

34:04.501 --> 34:06.617
These marshmallows might be more dangerous.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.118
-Want one?
-No, thank you.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.337
Okay, what exactly is this?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.502
It's a perpetual motion machine.

34:12.634 --> 34:15.342
A perpetual motion machine.
| didn't even think that existed.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.255
It doesn't. Can you tell us why?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.255
-Ah. Energy dissipates over time.
-Correct.

34:20.391 --> 34:24.306
Friction means every molecule
has to fight to keep going.

34:24.853 --> 34:27.471
-That's how the universe works.
-People, too.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.190
Chuck, I just emailed you
the Shady Ellms members list.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.530
Surprise, surprise, no Mia Eng,
but I'm cross-referencing with the 34 folks

34:36.658 --> 34:38.614
who visited the Oval
and could know about Louden.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.780
With no match,
it's back to the drawing board.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.282
-It can't be.
-[beeps]

34:43.415 --> 34:46.828
-Chuck?
-Andrea Frost is the only name on both lists.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.500
Andrea Frost?

34:49.379 --> 34:50.244
What?

34:50.380 --> 34:51.460
[Hannah] Aaron, it's me.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.581
| need to talk to the president immediately.
| don't care. Set it up.

34:55.342 --> 34:58.552
| wouldn't talk to him yet.
We've got nothing, Hannah.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.680
At least we know who we're chasing.
| mean, it's a start.

35:04.144 --> 35:04.975
-Hannah!
-[Hannah grunts]

35:08.523 --> 35:09.308
[Damian grunts]

35:14.154 --> 35:16.612
[Hannah] Agent down. I need an ambulance!

35:22.912 --> 35:26.826
You leaking the story about Moss
was not fruit of the poisonous tree.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.949
No.
Chuck got the information legitimately.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.873
But you still ordered a subordinate
to commit a felony.

35:32.005 --> 35:33.336
| did, but he didn't.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.674
| hate to break it to you, but a good
prosecutor could still make a case

35:36.801 --> 35:39.589
for conspiracy. And you're one the first
witness West will call. If he asks--

35:39.721 --> 35:43.089
-I'll take the Fifth.
-You can't. West won't give any of us immunity.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.477
You answer, it's bad for you
and the president.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.388
[sighs] So, what do I do?

35:47.520 --> 35:50.603
Wait till we see
if the proceeding is even happening.

35:50.732 --> 35:51.767
Your fate isn't sealed yet.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.562
It's not a certainty that West will find out
what you did.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.327
[, uh...

36:03.745 --> 36:04.826
| screwed up.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.619
To protect your boss. But yeah, big-time.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.089
[Tom] Hey, Little Pea.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.758
How was school?

36:25.308 --> 36:27.845
Good. What are you doing here?

36:28.937 --> 36:32.100
Got a little break,
and I wanted to talk to you.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.110
-About what?
-[sighs]

36:36.444 --> 36:40.233
There may be some people who are gonna say
some things about me, and...

36:40.365 --> 36:42.026
What kind of things?

36:43.993 --> 36:45.700
You've been through so much this year.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.072
I'm not even gonna try talking to you
like a little kid anymore.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.165
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

36:52.293 --> 36:58.130
And the truth is that since Mom died,
I've been really sad and lonely and angry.

36:59.050 --> 37:03.214
| decided that I should talk to somebody,
someone who's really good at listening.

37:03.346 --> 37:08.682
-He's a psychiatrist, and a psychiatrist--
- I don't think you're crazy, Daddy.

37:08.810 --> 37:12.223
-What makes you say that?
-Some of the kids at school.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.440
They say you're crazy.

37:15.984 --> 37:19.147
| tell them you're not. [chuckles softly]
You're just messy...

37:19.946 --> 37:21.653
bad at picking out ties.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.524
And maybe a little sad about Mommy.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.530
Yeah. Come here.

37:32.834 --> 37:33.790
[Tom sighs]

37:33.918 --> 37:35.829
You know, you're pretty smart.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.374
-I kKnow.
-[chuckles]

37:43.052 --> 37:46.590
The good news is the press still hasn't tripped
to the 25th Amendment stuff.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.554
Yet.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.891
Bad news. These are the final
agreed-upon procedures for the inquiry.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.555
We've got a puncher's chance.
But that's it.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.270
We're facing a heavyweight, so we have--

37:55.398 --> 37:58.231
A week left before we're looking
for new jobs.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.690
[Tom] Probably even sooner.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.606
[stuttering] Mr. President, I was, um...

38:02.739 --> 38:06.528
Being honest, Seth. One of the many things
| admire about you.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.533
Truth is,
| admire every single one of you.

38:13.291 --> 38:18.457
No president could ever have wanted
a more loyal or dedicated staff.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.129
It's been an honor to serve with you.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.800
[sighs]
One of the great honors of my life.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.265
Sir, I would've come to you.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.606
It's been an unusual day,
so I'm making the rounds.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.104
| wanted to apologize.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.353
-Sir?
-I'm not happy about what happened,

38:45.281 --> 38:48.490
but given the circumstances,
| felt you treated me fairly. So, thank you.

38:48.618 --> 38:51.736
Mr. President,
| am so sorry about all this.

38:51.871 --> 38:55.080
You did what you thought was right.
You can't fault anyone for that.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.252
Anyway...

39:00.338 --> 39:04.332
| know you've been going over the details
of the hearing with my staff,

39:04.467 --> 39:07.505
but I wanted to weigh in myself.
These are my demands.

39:09.514 --> 39:13.007
Uh, Mr. President, as I told Kendra,
I'm not inclined to give any more ground.

39:14.143 --> 39:15.053
Open it.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.226
It's blank.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.105
That is correct. I have no terms.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.400
If I can't convince the people
that I've been working with

39:27.532 --> 39:29.864
that based on everything that I've done,

39:29.993 --> 39:32.951
| have earned the right to remain president,
| don't want the job.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.201
That's very noble. That's stirring, even.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.575
But here's the thing: I won't pull any punches.
I've got a job to do.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.416
[Tom] I understand,

39:40.545 --> 39:42.912
and you should expect
I'm gonna do everything I have to

39:43.047 --> 39:44.708
to keep doing mine.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.835
| expect nothing less, Mr. President.

39:47.635 --> 39:48.466
Thank you.
