REBOUND (PART 1 )

00:06.841 --> 00:10.292
Hey, everybody.
l'm back from my Florida vacation.

00:10.470 --> 00:13.424
Good to be home,
back with the old gang.

00:13.598 --> 00:17.097
Hey, how you been, pal?
Glad to, buddy.

00:18.144 --> 00:23.305
Look at that. Here's the old bar.
lt hasn't changed a bit.

00:23.483 --> 00:26.057
Hey, you're back! Good to see you.

00:26.236 --> 00:28.477
- lt's good to be back.
- Oh, it's you.

00:28.655 --> 00:31.146
From behind
you looked like a friend of mine.

00:31.324 --> 00:33.993
Hey, you kidder. l'll get you for that.

00:36.455 --> 00:39.290
- So, hi, Coach.
- Hi, Cliffie.

00:39.458 --> 00:44.832
Boy, did l have a spectacular time
basking up the old Florida sunshine.

00:45.005 --> 00:48.706
l'll tell you. l really got my head
screwed on straight, too.

00:48.884 --> 00:51.719
That experience changed me.

00:51.887 --> 00:56.384
l'm now at one with the cosmos.
No more getting caught up...

00:58.019 --> 01:00.058
At one with the cosmos, Coach.

01:00.229 --> 01:04.061
No more getting caught up
in the irritations of day-to-day life...

01:04.233 --> 01:07.103
l'm just the kinda guy...

01:07.278 --> 01:12.070
Yeah, l stood on many a wind-swept
beach and felt a oneness...

01:13.743 --> 01:16.068
felt...a...

01:33.096 --> 01:35.172
Anybody want a Mai Tai?

01:38.643 --> 01:43.934
Mai Tai, Cliff! Look! You get it?
Mai Tai, Cliffie!

02:58.601 --> 03:01.056
- Good afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

03:01.228 --> 03:02.639
Beer, Normie?

03:02.813 --> 03:06.513
You know how to make it
sound tempting, you fast talker!

03:07.527 --> 03:10.611
- Guess who, buddy.
- Hey, Cliffie.

03:10.779 --> 03:13.022
Missed you the last couple of days.

03:15.159 --> 03:18.575
- l've been gone two weeks.
- l know.

03:20.582 --> 03:23.867
Oh, God, l missed this guy!

03:24.043 --> 03:27.876
Norm, how's Vera? Any luck
getting her in the family way yet?

03:28.047 --> 03:32.341
- Still working on it.
- Hey, Norm, you want a kid?

03:32.510 --> 03:37.053
Not really. l'm just kinda going along
with it to shut Vera up.

03:37.223 --> 03:40.225
She wants to start a family
to have something to do.

03:40.394 --> 03:44.225
Poor Norm's been shooting blanks
for the last couple of months.

03:44.397 --> 03:46.437
Little louder. We'll dance to it.

03:48.318 --> 03:53.396
Don't worry, Normie. You'll be planting
your seed before you know it.

03:54.575 --> 03:57.825
l hope so. The doc says
if something doesn't happen soon,

03:57.995 --> 04:00.451
we may have to take a drastic step.

04:00.623 --> 04:04.074
- You mean...
- Sleep together.

04:08.131 --> 04:10.586
- Our prayers are with you.
- Thank you.

04:10.758 --> 04:14.091
Coach, how's Sammy been
since l've been away?

04:14.261 --> 04:16.930
Just about the same, Cliffie. Terrible.

04:17.096 --> 04:21.226
You should've seen him the other night.
He walks in with this lady librarian.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.478
She's off-duty, right?
They both have a snootful.

04:24.647 --> 04:28.432
- The lady librarian's got...
- Hey, gang!

04:29.277 --> 04:31.565
Never mind. My story's obsolete.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.778
- Coach?
- Yeah.

04:33.949 --> 04:37.033
- This is my bar, isn't it?
- Yeah, it sure is, Sam.

04:37.201 --> 04:39.740
l told you l owned a bar.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.119
l like it, Sam.

04:42.290 --> 04:45.742
lt's not much. But then again, l am.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.620
Hey, Sammy? l think you got one
over the legal limit there.

04:49.798 --> 04:53.713
Hey, Cliffie's back!
How was your vacation?

04:53.886 --> 04:56.174
My vacation. You remembered?

04:56.346 --> 05:00.676
- Atlantic City, right?
- Yeah, it was terrific. Thanks a lot.

05:01.685 --> 05:05.054
What branch of the service
are these young ladies in?

05:07.108 --> 05:11.058
l stole them off the front of a parade
last night, Coach.

05:11.237 --> 05:16.064
At this very moment there are 26
tuba players marching right into the river.

05:16.659 --> 05:19.031
Show them your stuff, girls.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.947
God, l love it!

05:25.126 --> 05:27.166
Excuse me, Sam.

05:27.337 --> 05:30.871
While you're waiting
for runway clearance...

05:34.010 --> 05:36.762
do you mind taking a look at this?

05:36.930 --> 05:41.141
This is a piece of paper, isn't it?
And those are words.

05:41.309 --> 05:45.888
- This is a letter or something.
- lt is Joanne's resignation.

05:46.065 --> 05:50.193
Hey, girls, take a break
and give your dimples a rest.

05:50.361 --> 05:53.030
- What?
- We lost another waitress.

05:53.197 --> 05:56.233
She found out
she wasn't the only girl in your life.

05:56.408 --> 06:00.406
Nonsense, Carla.
She's been listening to vicious rumours.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.663
Sammy, this means
that l have to work alone again.

06:03.832 --> 06:07.451
We can't keep a waitress
because you keep breaking their hearts.

06:07.628 --> 06:11.079
Well, obviously l need a good talking to.

06:11.257 --> 06:13.794
Sammy, this is serious!

06:18.055 --> 06:21.175
We've had eight waitresses
in six months.

06:21.350 --> 06:23.924
Bet l can remember all their names.

06:24.103 --> 06:30.522
Dee Dee, Carlene, Angela, Sneezy,
Dopey, Donner and Blitzen.

06:30.694 --> 06:35.486
OK, girls, yo!
Step right this way, ladies.

06:35.657 --> 06:39.951
lt's time for the half-time show at the
Sammy-dome. Here you go, step lively!

06:40.120 --> 06:42.361
Poor Sam.

06:42.539 --> 06:44.579
Yeah, my heart bleeds for him.

06:46.168 --> 06:48.955
Sure, Cliffie,
he looks like he's having fun,

06:49.129 --> 06:51.834
but this is just the first stage.

06:52.007 --> 06:55.340
He's going to end up
drinking himself senseless.

06:55.510 --> 06:57.550
He's turning into a real jerk.

06:57.721 --> 07:01.849
Spends his time boozing
and loving and leaving waitresses.

07:02.017 --> 07:04.259
l wonder what set him off.

07:04.436 --> 07:06.974
Suppose it might have been Dia...

07:09.024 --> 07:10.852
Diabetes!

07:11.027 --> 07:13.779
You were going to say that name?

07:13.947 --> 07:16.437
- l wasn't.
- You know my rule.

07:16.616 --> 07:20.448
- But l didn't say it.
- l don't even want you to think it.

07:20.620 --> 07:23.954
Use that name
and l will give you a sunroof.

07:31.089 --> 07:34.458
What difference does it make
how it started?

07:34.634 --> 07:37.718
The important thing is
can we do anything to stop him?

07:37.887 --> 07:40.259
lf we can't, can we join him?

07:45.270 --> 07:48.721
lf we can't join him,
do you think he'd let me watch?

07:52.695 --> 07:55.565
Cheers. Yeah, he's here.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.823
l'll give him the message.
Normie, it's Vera.

07:58.992 --> 08:02.362
She says to hurry home.
Her cycle is at its peak.

08:02.538 --> 08:04.163
Again?

08:04.332 --> 08:08.827
Her cycle has more peaks
than the Adirondacks.

08:09.002 --> 08:11.754
All systems are go there, big fella.

08:11.922 --> 08:15.837
Even Secretariat got to wait
till he was in the mood once in a while.

08:26.020 --> 08:30.184
Poor Coach!
After all you went through with Sam,

08:30.357 --> 08:32.980
seeing him right back where he was.

08:33.153 --> 08:35.192
Really, Carla, it's eating me up.

08:35.363 --> 08:39.063
l'm so desperate l feel like
l'm going to do something crazy.

08:39.241 --> 08:41.734
l am going to do something crazy!

08:41.910 --> 08:46.324
- Wait. What are you going to do?
- l know exactly what Sam needs.

08:48.043 --> 08:51.412
- Coach, your apron!
- He's got an apron!

08:57.469 --> 09:00.553
- Just put them down there.
- Thank you, Miss.

09:00.722 --> 09:05.100
Now l know why l became a chauffeur
instead of a longshoreman.

09:05.269 --> 09:09.101
l would have been 72
on my next birthday.

09:09.899 --> 09:12.436
l appreciate your bringing me home,
Boggs.

09:12.610 --> 09:16.524
Your mother and l felt strongly
that the first face one should encounter

09:16.697 --> 09:19.817
on leaving a place like that
should be a friendly one.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.863
Why didn't she ever visit me there?

09:23.037 --> 09:25.243
She wanted to visit you,
Miss Diane,

09:25.414 --> 09:30.124
but you know how uncomfortable she is
around psychiatrists.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.583
She could have written me a letter.

09:32.755 --> 09:36.006
And let them see her handwriting?

09:38.052 --> 09:40.092
Boggs, that's insane.

09:40.263 --> 09:44.308
As your mother would say,
''Let's see them prove it in court.''

09:44.476 --> 09:47.097
Which reminds me,
l should be getting back.

09:47.270 --> 09:50.390
- Thanks again for driving me home.
- lt's my pleasure.

09:50.566 --> 09:53.270
lt's so nice to see you happy again.

09:53.444 --> 09:59.980
Boggs, l think l'm as happy
as l've ever been. l have a new life.

10:00.158 --> 10:04.536
All these wonderful things
have happened to me. l'm better now.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.490
Miss?

10:07.666 --> 10:11.082
l'm fine, Boggs.
l was just a little startled.

10:11.253 --> 10:15.416
- lt's a perfectly normal reaction.
- Perfectly.

10:21.014 --> 10:25.142
- Who is it?
- lt's Ernie Pantusso.

10:25.310 --> 10:27.598
Coach? What do you want?

10:27.770 --> 10:30.522
l have to talk to you. lt's important.

10:30.690 --> 10:36.645
Coach, you're a dear man and l love you
and l've missed you,

10:36.822 --> 10:42.824
but you're part of a period of my life
that l want to see fade into memory.

10:43.829 --> 10:45.868
Do you understand, Coach?

10:51.669 --> 10:53.995
Western Union.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.420
This is a man l could never resist.

11:06.602 --> 11:09.519
- How have you been?
- Fine. And you?

11:09.688 --> 11:14.813
- l'm OK, thank you.
- Sorry l had to fool you that way.

11:18.072 --> 11:21.939
Perhaps l should be taking
this opportunity to be going along.

11:24.329 --> 11:27.531
Say hello to Mummy.
Why don't you have her call me?

11:27.706 --> 11:30.198
You know how she feels
about telephones.

11:30.376 --> 11:33.460
Well, tell her to write. Or, l'll write.

11:33.629 --> 11:36.749
Or maybe we'll just run into
each other sometime.

11:36.925 --> 11:41.172
Nothing would please her more.
Goodbye.

11:44.057 --> 11:47.591
How many pairs of socks
has a guy like that got?

11:47.769 --> 11:51.434
l have no idea.
Can l get you something?

11:51.607 --> 11:55.521
l don't know what l've got. l've been
away several months at a sana...

11:55.694 --> 11:57.816
...vacation.

11:57.988 --> 12:00.479
You didn't run into Cliffie, did you?

12:00.657 --> 12:04.904
No. Did he have
a nervous...vacation, too?

12:05.078 --> 12:07.118
Oh, he's a wreck.

12:08.123 --> 12:11.706
Listen, Diane,
have you thought about stopping by

12:11.878 --> 12:14.285
and saying hello to everybody?

12:14.463 --> 12:16.788
Coach, that wouldn't be a good idea.

12:18.592 --> 12:21.796
Why?
Does anyone there ask about me?

12:21.971 --> 12:24.723
No, that Carla won't let them.

12:27.977 --> 12:33.399
Diane, l want you to come back
to Cheers and have a talk with Sam.

12:35.985 --> 12:38.061
Talk with S...

12:42.951 --> 12:45.524
Yes, it's very important.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.784
Maybe S...

12:57.340 --> 13:02.631
Maybe the bartender there didn't tell you
about our last conversation,

13:02.804 --> 13:05.260
but it ended in wrath and acrimony.

13:05.432 --> 13:09.382
l vowed never to return to Cheers.
Let's be clear,

13:09.562 --> 13:14.307
nothing in heaven or hell
will ever get me back there.

13:18.821 --> 13:21.572
Diane, you might be my last chance.

13:23.075 --> 13:25.115
Sam's boozing again.

13:27.496 --> 13:29.573
Oh, dear.

13:37.590 --> 13:39.630
Poor S...

13:43.972 --> 13:46.178
Poor, dear S...

13:47.266 --> 13:49.306
Am!

13:58.195 --> 14:00.602
Well, l'm back.

14:00.781 --> 14:05.775
- What'll it be, Normie?
- A transfusion with a head on it.

14:07.704 --> 14:11.488
Norm, are you sure
you want to have a kid?

14:11.666 --> 14:16.412
Once the monster comes along,
your whole life will be different.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.258
You've had kids.
Does a baby change you?

14:19.425 --> 14:23.374
Are you kidding, Normie?
lt can't even change itself.

14:24.555 --> 14:26.762
Well, l'll have to remember that.

14:33.731 --> 14:35.973
- What day is it?
- Friday.

14:36.150 --> 14:38.523
That's it.
Good night, everybody.

14:38.695 --> 14:42.989
- Sam, please! You can't leave.
- Why not?

14:43.157 --> 14:47.321
A friend of yours is dropping by,
and l promised you'd be here.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.702
Great! One of my old buds?

14:49.873 --> 14:54.167
- l smell high times coming.
- Actually it's an old girlfriend.

14:54.336 --> 15:00.172
Better still. Hope it's one of the wild
ones. But then, weren't they all?

15:00.342 --> 15:04.554
- No, they weren't all wild.
- Hold it right there, Coach!

15:04.722 --> 15:06.844
lf you are talking...

15:07.933 --> 15:12.975
...about the stick, l'll pull your lower lip
over your head like a cabbage leaf.

15:14.440 --> 15:18.389
Cut it out, Carla.
Diane's not coming back here.

15:18.569 --> 15:22.187
- She said she's not coming back.
- Well, she might.

15:22.364 --> 15:24.654
- What makes you say that?
- l asked her.

15:27.370 --> 15:33.040
- What the hell did you do that for?
- Please listen to her.

15:33.209 --> 15:37.706
- Promise me.
- l know what this is all about.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.372
lt's this drinking crap, isn't it?

15:40.550 --> 15:43.385
l'm drinking because l like it,

15:43.553 --> 15:47.088
because it tastes good,
and because l want to.

15:48.349 --> 15:50.675
l don't want to see Diane Chambers.

15:50.851 --> 15:55.894
You're going to have to see her
because she'll be here any second now!

15:57.192 --> 16:01.320
God! We are all sitting around here
like we're at the Queen's Tea

16:01.488 --> 16:04.655
and that thing is on its way.

16:05.533 --> 16:10.196
ln fact, it's very close. l can sense it.

16:17.671 --> 16:21.918
lt's here! And it's going to walk in
and say something.

16:24.553 --> 16:26.961
Stay out of this, Carla.

16:39.319 --> 16:42.355
Hello...Sam.

16:46.618 --> 16:49.191
Hi there. Did you forget something?

16:50.830 --> 16:53.286
l dropped in to see how you're doing.

16:53.458 --> 16:57.586
l just got back from Florida, Diane.

16:58.213 --> 17:01.000
Everybody's fine. You're looking good.

17:02.050 --> 17:06.130
- Thank you. How are you doing?
- l've never been better.

17:06.304 --> 17:09.222
For God's sakes, will you stop it, Sam?

17:09.391 --> 17:13.305
You've been boozing with two hands
ever since Diane walked out on you.

17:13.478 --> 17:18.188
- Sam, l'm so sorry.
- You're both crazier than hell!

17:18.358 --> 17:20.814
l threw her out of here and my drinking

17:20.986 --> 17:25.896
has got nothing to do
with Diane Chambers. You hear that?

17:26.074 --> 17:28.531
- Nothing!
- No, you're all wrong.

17:28.702 --> 17:30.742
Sorry!

17:30.913 --> 17:34.283
l did start drinking when she left.
l was celebrating.

17:34.458 --> 17:37.459
Celebrating the day l got rid of you.
You hear?

17:37.628 --> 17:39.870
Celebrating!

17:42.133 --> 17:45.965
l'll tell you something.
l have two birthdays now.

17:46.137 --> 17:48.379
One for when my mother bore me,

17:48.556 --> 17:52.506
and one to commemorate
my glorious rebirth when l left here.

17:52.686 --> 17:56.268
Just once more. You did not walk out,
l kicked you out.

17:56.439 --> 18:00.852
l'd do it again, except no man
deserves that much pleasure in one life.

18:01.027 --> 18:04.776
Your brain could find shelter
in the shade of a snow pea.

18:04.948 --> 18:08.115
Don't, Sam! Please.

18:09.578 --> 18:12.579
l didn't come here
to fight with you.

18:12.748 --> 18:14.989
l came here to help.

18:15.876 --> 18:18.961
Well, l've never been happier
in my entire life.

18:19.129 --> 18:22.130
You're going to help me out
of all my happiness?

18:22.299 --> 18:25.170
- You're the one person who could do it.
- No.

18:25.344 --> 18:28.096
l want you to see a friend of mine.

18:28.264 --> 18:31.549
He's a man l met recently at a sana...
vacation.

18:32.935 --> 18:36.802
She's been locked up in a mental home
for three months.

18:36.981 --> 18:40.930
l was not locked up. l could come
and go at will. Besides, it's not true.

18:41.110 --> 18:47.196
- And how did you know about it?
- l got a cousin who's a private dick.

18:47.367 --> 18:52.408
l wanted to find out if you were really
gone. And you were really gone!

18:52.580 --> 18:58.084
l entered Golden Brook of my own
volition for a little rest, relaxation...

19:00.714 --> 19:03.205
What are you laughing at?

19:03.383 --> 19:07.463
Well, l've had women get depressed
when they left me,

19:07.638 --> 19:10.639
but l've never had one that went...

19:14.812 --> 19:19.141
Charm like yours is a hard thing
to live without all right.

19:19.316 --> 19:21.938
lt had nothing to do with you, Sam.

19:22.111 --> 19:25.112
After l left here,
l decided l needed to regroup.

19:25.281 --> 19:28.484
l needed to take a good look at myself.

19:28.659 --> 19:31.779
Shock treatment.

19:31.954 --> 19:35.536
Carla, let's help Sam first.

19:35.708 --> 19:40.085
And when the psychiatric profession
has gained confidence from that triumph,

19:40.254 --> 19:43.041
we'll put them all on your case.

19:45.551 --> 19:49.798
- Will you please meet this man?
- Come on, Diane.

19:49.972 --> 19:52.724
Look... Yeah, l'm drinking again,

19:52.892 --> 19:55.218
but it's not the same thing.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.645
This time
it's good-time controlled drinking.

19:58.815 --> 20:00.974
Before it was negative. Now it's fun.

20:01.985 --> 20:07.441
- lt won't kill you to talk to the guy.
- Coach, it's a waste of time.

20:07.616 --> 20:10.285
Am l right, Carla?

20:14.247 --> 20:18.080
- See what her friend has to say.
- Oh, come on...

20:18.668 --> 20:25.288
- You listening to this, guys?
- Sammy, you're my friend, right?

20:25.468 --> 20:29.085
Don't get defensive,
but maybe you are drinking too much.

20:29.263 --> 20:33.260
- Well, so are you.
- l already have a mother, lush face.

20:37.146 --> 20:41.689
Sorry, l just think maybe
you ought to hear the guy out.

20:41.859 --> 20:45.062
Sammy, the way l see it
is it can't do any harm

20:45.238 --> 20:49.152
and psychiatry has come a long way
since ''The Snake Pit'' age.

20:49.826 --> 20:54.037
Sam, they're all trying to tell you
you need help.

20:54.205 --> 20:56.910
l know what they're saying and why.

20:57.083 --> 21:00.368
Coach here's gotten them all
to gang up on me.

21:00.545 --> 21:04.590
When you try to be a fun-loving drunk,
you find out who your friends are.

21:04.757 --> 21:09.135
OK, fine, forget it. Drink all you want.
l know the reason why you're doing it.

21:09.304 --> 21:11.796
What are you talking about?

21:11.973 --> 21:15.259
You're afraid that l'm right
about you and the doctor.

21:15.435 --> 21:19.184
You can't stand admitting
l'm right about anything.

21:19.356 --> 21:21.265
Wrong again!

21:23.610 --> 21:26.231
You're scared, Sam.

21:32.244 --> 21:36.573
lf l see this guy and he tells me that
l'm happy and well-adjusted,

21:36.749 --> 21:41.328
which he will, if the quack has a brain,
would you all please leave me alone?

21:41.504 --> 21:44.955
- Of course. Won't we?
- Yeah, sure.

21:48.135 --> 21:53.510
OK, fine. Tell him to drop by.
l'll try to fit him in between dames.

21:53.682 --> 21:56.719
Why don't you say hello
to him now?

21:58.396 --> 22:01.267
l'm Dr Frasier Crane.
Sorry l startled you.

22:02.901 --> 22:05.142
This is weird.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.855
Diane said you're open-minded
and would be responsive,

22:09.032 --> 22:11.190
so l dropped by a little early.

22:11.368 --> 22:14.654
- She said that?
- She says lots of nice things about you.

22:15.747 --> 22:17.705
Really?

22:17.875 --> 22:22.252
So what say we go somewhere
and have a cup of coffee

22:22.420 --> 22:24.746
and...get to know each other?

22:26.550 --> 22:28.542
OK. Fine.

22:28.719 --> 22:34.223
A few cups of lrish coffee and a chat
it is. Mind if l freshen up a bit?

22:34.391 --> 22:36.598
- Fine.
- Thank you, Sam.

22:38.270 --> 22:40.940
Boy, you sure are back in here

22:41.106 --> 22:45.187
for somebody who said
they were never coming back in here.

22:45.361 --> 22:49.442
Human beings change, Sam.
l've changed. So can you.

22:49.616 --> 22:52.533
Rest assured, l'm only visiting.

22:52.701 --> 22:54.860
Correct me if l'm wrong,

22:55.038 --> 23:00.114
but you just called me human
for the first time.

23:00.293 --> 23:04.337
l guess l just needed a little time
to think about it.

23:12.055 --> 23:15.306
- l knew it.
- What?

23:15.476 --> 23:19.307
Are you kidding?
Don't you see she's nuts about me?

23:19.480 --> 23:23.394
Her young Doctor Killjoy there
is just her way of saving face

23:23.567 --> 23:25.607
to get back in the bar.

23:25.777 --> 23:29.193
- l don't know, Sam.
- l know the look.

23:29.365 --> 23:31.441
She's in love.

23:33.368 --> 23:36.323
- l have to run.
- Diane, you're remarkable,

23:36.497 --> 23:40.032
to help a man
who's caused you so much grief.

23:40.209 --> 23:42.831
l'm free of it now, Frasier.

23:43.003 --> 23:47.464
l'm free of so many things now
that l've fallen in love with you.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.960
l am the luckiest person on earth.

23:52.138 --> 23:54.380
The second luckiest.

23:55.558 --> 23:57.716
Not here, Diane.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.308
Of course. l get carried away.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.518
- l understand.
- That's why l love you.
