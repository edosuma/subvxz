MAN:
Well, that's what's brilliant
about you, Mr. Feldman.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.318
No one else would have thought
of building

01:24.352 --> 01:25.753
a residential mini-mall.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.122
Now that I've got everyone
else on the block

01:28.156 --> 01:29.590
to agree to your offer,
I think we're...

01:29.623 --> 01:32.393
It's got to be everyone
on the block-- everyone--

01:32.426 --> 01:34.128
or the deal's off.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.130
Oh, we're headed
into the canyon.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.265
I think I'm losing you.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.599
Mr. Feldman.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.268
Cut the crap, Dittmeyer.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.603
Did you get everyone or not?

01:42.636 --> 01:45.273
Well, there's this one family
that's holding out.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.607
Then sweeten the deal.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.608
Up the offer.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.143
It's not that simple.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.445
It's like they're not interested
in money.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.347
It's like they're not normal.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.682
Why the hell not?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.884
What's their story?

01:56.917 --> 02:00.788
* Here's the story
of a lovely lady *

02:00.821 --> 02:05.159
* Who was bringing up
three very lovely girls *

02:05.193 --> 02:09.630
* All of them had hair of gold
like their mother *

02:09.663 --> 02:12.300
* The youngest one in curls

02:12.333 --> 02:16.337
* It's a story
of a man named Brady *

02:16.370 --> 02:19.640
* Who was busy with three boys
of his own *

02:19.673 --> 02:23.811
* They were four men
living all together *

02:23.844 --> 02:27.448
* Yet they were all alone

02:27.481 --> 02:30.684
* Till the one day
when the lady met this fellow *

02:30.718 --> 02:34.355
* And they knew that it was
much more than a hunch *

02:34.388 --> 02:38.326
* That this group must
somehow form a family *

02:38.359 --> 02:41.462
* That's the way we all became
the Brady Bunch *

02:41.495 --> 02:44.198
* The Brady Bunch

02:44.232 --> 02:46.267
* The Brady Bunch

02:46.300 --> 02:50.838
* That's the way we became
the Brady Bunch. *

( sighs )

03:10.358 --> 03:13.494
( heavy metal music playing )

03:13.527 --> 03:15.329
( grunts )

03:17.731 --> 03:19.233
Don't worry about me.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.302
I'm okay.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.504
Morning, Mrs. Brady.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.605
Oh, thanks, Alice.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.673
Morning, Alice.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.208
Careful, Mr. Brady.
Don't bend over.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.545
We've gotten

03:31.579 --> 03:33.714
the Dittmeyers' mail
again, sweetheart.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.516
You'd think, after
all these years

03:35.549 --> 03:37.251
they'd know
who lives where.

03:37.285 --> 03:40.421
Well, I always know where
to deliver my mail.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.355
Mr. Brady...

03:41.389 --> 03:43.357
( lisping ):
Mommy, Marcia's been

03:43.391 --> 03:45.426
in the bathroom for
a super-long time.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.727
Now, Cindy, we've
told you before--

03:46.760 --> 03:48.429
no one likes
a tattletale.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.030
But, Daddy...

03:50.063 --> 03:51.365
Your father's right,
sweetheart.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.366
Why don't you

03:52.400 --> 03:53.567
help Alice
make some cookies?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.702
Okay, Mommy.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.037
But can my doll help, too?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.039
As long as it's
not Betsy Wetsy.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.709
She makes my cookies
soggy woggy.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.910
Oh, Alice.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.613
Mmm.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.982
4,998...

04:09.016 --> 04:10.751
Come on, Marcia, open up.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.420
I've got to shave.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.055
4,999...

04:15.088 --> 04:18.426
Gosh, Marcia, there are
other people in this family

04:18.459 --> 04:19.593
besides you.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.928
5,000.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.431
JAN:
Come on, Marcia.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.934
Doug Simpson's sure
to notice me today.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.602
All finished.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.603
Finally.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.938
Greg.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.607
Jan, you're just going
to have to wait your turn.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.409
It's never my turn.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.587
Jan, did you move
my trophies?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.323
Yes. I couldn't look
in the mirror

04:49.357 --> 04:53.093
without seeing the awards
of the great Marcia Brady.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.796
( clears throat )

04:55.829 --> 04:58.966
I believe these are
my white kneesocks.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.935
Not everything in
this room is yours.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.044
See, Jan? I told you
they were mine.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.647
Now, put them back,
and don't forget to close

05:13.681 --> 05:14.982
the drawer when you're done.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.486
She has every right to be mad.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.654
They are her socks.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.991
But why does Marcia get
all the socks?

05:24.024 --> 05:26.660
Why does Marcia get
all the trophies?

05:26.694 --> 05:30.598
Why does Marcia get
all the good drawers?

05:30.631 --> 05:33.734
Yeah. Why does Marcia
get everything?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.771
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.610
It's closed!

05:42.643 --> 05:45.012
Come on, Greg. Hurry up.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.681
( voice cracking ):
Boy, he's worse than Marcia.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.383
Hmm.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.852
Hey, what's wrong
with your voice?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.855
Well, my libido is increasing
at a rapid rate

05:54.888 --> 05:56.524
and the surge of hormones

05:56.557 --> 06:00.394
causes dramatic physical
and emotional changes.

06:00.428 --> 06:04.164
Well, that's what Miss Lynley
told us in health class.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.866
Finally.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.568
Yeah.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.738
Well, you kids have no idea what
it takes to impress a chick.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.540
Maybe, someday,
when you're older

06:12.573 --> 06:14.842
you'll get hip
to what it's like being a man.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.578
Good news, Greg.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.414
I'm putting on your favorite
Scooby Doo bedsheets.

06:20.448 --> 06:21.549
( laughing )

06:21.582 --> 06:24.017
Scooby Dooby doo!

06:25.619 --> 06:29.089
Honey, I think you've
stirred that enough.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.491
I'm not stirring.

06:30.524 --> 06:34.562
I'm looking for
Kitty Carryall's underpants.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.896
I tell you what.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.898
Why don't I take
over the cookies,

06:37.931 --> 06:40.434
and you run these letters
to the Dittmeyers

06:40.468 --> 06:43.170
and see if they've gotten
any of our mail by mistake.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.538
Okay, Mommy.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.822
( siren blaring )

07:01.855 --> 07:03.056
Missy,

07:03.090 --> 07:05.025
get your butt-ugly face
down here!

07:05.058 --> 07:06.994
Hello, Eric.
Are your parents home?

07:07.027 --> 07:09.497
Blow off, cheeseball.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.032
Missy!

07:12.065 --> 07:15.469
Shut up before you
have a toxic dump.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.504
Hello, Missy.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.138
How's your science project
coming?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.206
I finished mine.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.208
What are you going to do?

07:21.241 --> 07:24.111
Hand in your face
and call it barf mold?

07:24.144 --> 07:27.948
( imitating lisp ):
Thee you on the theethaw,
Thindy.

07:27.981 --> 07:28.649
Bye.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.952
( tires screeching )

07:33.654 --> 07:36.089
Look, Mr. Feldman, I promised
they'd sell, and they will.

07:36.123 --> 07:36.857
Like the Bates deal.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
Yeah, I know I took
it in the rear

07:38.559 --> 07:39.660
on that subdivision,
but this time,

07:39.693 --> 07:40.661
I'm the one
who's doing the screwing.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.663
Yeah, well, just make sure
one holdout family

07:42.696 --> 07:44.131
doesn't wreck this. You hear me?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.265
Look, can I call you back?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.634
Yeah.
Thanks.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.636
Hello, Mr. Dittmeyer.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.638
Why are you here?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.639
Oh.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.973
Thanks.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.907
Mom asked me to ask you

07:53.941 --> 07:55.943
if there's mail for us here
by mistake.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.578
I... I don't understand you.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.979
What do you want?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.180
Mom asked me to ask you

08:00.213 --> 08:02.215
if there's any mail for us here
by mistake.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.751
What?

08:03.784 --> 08:04.718
Mom asked me to ask you

08:04.752 --> 08:06.987
if there's any mail
for us here by mistake.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.155
Nope. Not a clue.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.792
She wants the Bradys' mail,
Larry!

08:11.825 --> 08:13.160
Thank you, darling.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.729
So kind of you to climb out
from under your hangover.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.164
Let's see.
Where did I file your mail?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.566
Oh, yes.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.204
Hi, honey.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.205
Hi.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.640
How's your daddy?

08:26.674 --> 08:27.174
He's fine.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.777
Mrs. Brady's lucky

08:29.810 --> 08:32.279
to have a big, strong,
virile man like that.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.984
Tell you what,
sweetie.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.552
Next Christmas,
you tell you daddy

08:38.586 --> 08:40.554
I'd be more than happy
to wrap his package.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.889
Okay.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.956
Here. Hit the road,
bad seed.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.959
Excuse me, but the juice
will make your shoes slip.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.761
( laughing ):
What?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.697
Your shoes'll slip in the juice.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.832
Oh.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.568
Bye.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.536
Bye-bye.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.211
( laughing )

09:07.014 --> 09:10.984
Daddy, Mrs. Dittmeyer said
that she'd be glad

09:11.018 --> 09:13.621
to wrap your package
this Christmas.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.623
Hmm... really?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.691
How is Mrs. Dittmeyer?

09:17.725 --> 09:20.260
Mr. Dittmeyer says
she's overhung.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.195
But he's not in a good mood

09:22.229 --> 09:25.132
because she's taking it
in the rear.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.167
Must be that paperboy again.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.170
Cindy, that's
Mr. Dittmeyer's business.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.905
Remember, nobody likes a snitch.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.073
I'm not a snitch.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.942
I just tell it like it is.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.844
You know, Cindy,
when you tattle
on someone,

09:36.877 --> 09:38.278
you're not just
telling on them.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.312
You're telling
on yourself.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.048
And, by tattling
on someone,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.150
you're really
just telling them,

09:43.183 --> 09:44.317
"I'm a tattletale."

09:44.351 --> 09:46.353
Now, is that the tale
you want to tell?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.989
I never thought
of it like that.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.291
Sweetheart, it's time to get

09:51.324 --> 09:52.960
your school things
together, honey.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.195
Okay, Mommy.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.264
Hmm...

09:57.297 --> 09:58.766
What is it, Mike?

09:58.799 --> 10:00.668
It's a letter
from the county.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.336
They say we
haven't paid
our property taxes.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.038
Haven't paid our taxes?

10:05.072 --> 10:06.674
We always pay our taxes.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.942
Well, they say it's
the fifth notice

10:08.976 --> 10:11.912
and we owe them $20,000
by the end of the week

10:11.945 --> 10:13.747
or they'll auction
our house.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.016
$20,000?!

10:16.049 --> 10:18.185
There has to be a mix-up.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.053
Well, we better call someone.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.421
We are?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.123
You do?

10:23.156 --> 10:25.158
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.960
I see.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.696
We should?!

10:28.729 --> 10:29.963
You are?!

10:29.997 --> 10:31.198
Uh-huh.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.034
All right. Good-bye.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.204
( sighs )

10:37.237 --> 10:38.739
We owe them.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.073
Oh, Mike.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.942
Well, don't
you worry, honey.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.343
We'll find the money.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.678
Find the money?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.213
But we used our savings

10:46.246 --> 10:49.216
to go to the Grand
Canyon and Hawaii.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.819
What are we going
to do, Mike?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.858
Okay, troops...

10:57.891 --> 10:59.192
time for school!

10:59.226 --> 11:00.193
Greg!

11:00.227 --> 11:01.194
Marcia!

11:01.228 --> 11:02.195
Peter!

11:02.229 --> 11:03.196
Jan!

11:03.230 --> 11:04.197
Bobby!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.198
Cindy!

11:05.232 --> 11:06.333
Oh!
Oh!

11:06.366 --> 11:07.868
Oh!
Oh!

11:07.901 --> 11:10.203
Do we always have
to walk so close?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.172
ALL:
Oh, Jan.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.341
Uh... Mom, can I borrow
your car today?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.343
I want to ask Donna Leonard

11:16.376 --> 11:18.345
to go out for a soda
after school.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.413
All right,
but no hot-rodding.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.782
Thanks, Mom.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.284
She's the most far-out chick
in my class.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.853
You wouldn't believe

11:25.886 --> 11:27.054
how much I dig her.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.055
Sure, I would.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.489
I've been digging Sam so long,

11:29.522 --> 11:31.024
by the time he proposes,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.192
I'll be six feet under.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.293
( all laughing )

11:33.326 --> 11:36.997
Oh, Alice, what would
we do without you?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.498
Probably eat out.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.067
( all laughing )

11:41.501 --> 11:44.004
Hey, why the
long face, Bobby?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.506
Well, ever since I became
a safety monitor

11:46.539 --> 11:48.141
at school...

11:48.175 --> 11:49.442
nobody will
talk to me.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.879
They think I'm
some kind of fink.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.914
Bobby, people
like to be corrected

11:53.947 --> 11:56.049
when they're doing
something wrong.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.018
That's how
we improve ourselves.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.320
Right, Dad.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.289
And, if your
sister would
wear her glasses,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.024
she just might
improve her eyesight.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.159
Marcia doesn't
have to wear glasses.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.195
Besides, all my friends
at school

12:08.228 --> 12:10.530
say glasses make me
look positively goofy.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.401
Now, honey, you look very lovely
with your glasses on.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.936
Doesn't she, kids?

12:15.969 --> 12:18.105
Far out, Jan.
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.239
GREG:
You look great.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.174
Yeah, I mean it.
Outtasight.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.342
( all murmuring agreement )

12:23.576 --> 12:25.412
MIKE:
All right, troops,
off to school.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.413
CAROL:
Good-bye.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.414
Have a good day.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.548
GREG:
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.549
Bye, Mom.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.550
Come on, Marcia.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.551
I'm coming.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.986
Jan, a real friend

12:33.020 --> 12:34.421
likes you
for who you are,

12:34.454 --> 12:36.156
not what's
on your face.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.457
If you judge
your friends

12:37.490 --> 12:38.892
for passing
judgment on you,

12:38.926 --> 12:40.393
you're not only
judging yourself

12:40.427 --> 12:42.295
you're judging your
friends for judging you.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.864
And that would be
using bad judgment.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.333
I never thought of it that way.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.301
CAROL:
Jan?

12:50.370 --> 12:51.504
Oh.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.477
Bye.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.979
CAROL:
Bye, honey.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.315
( sighs )

13:15.362 --> 13:17.030
Bye, Bobby.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.398
Bye, Jan.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.301
Oh!

13:26.273 --> 13:27.440
Oh! Oh!

13:33.513 --> 13:34.314
( loud crash )

13:34.347 --> 13:35.482
Ow!

13:37.584 --> 13:40.253
( dog barking )

13:40.287 --> 13:41.388
( horn honking )

13:41.421 --> 13:44.124
( tires screeching )

13:44.157 --> 13:46.459
Stupid little
punk kid, stay out

13:46.493 --> 13:47.527
of the road!

13:48.595 --> 13:50.430
( brakes screeching )

13:50.463 --> 13:52.399
( horn honking )

13:54.634 --> 13:56.203
Davy Jones is the most.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.637
I sure wish
he'd write back.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.372
I wrote him
over a month ago.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.042
But, Marcia, he gets
millions of letters.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.911
But I president
of his fan club

14:03.944 --> 14:04.912
and I invited him

14:04.945 --> 14:06.613
to entertain
at the school dance.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.381
A big rock star like that

14:08.415 --> 14:11.351
can't just drop everything
for our dance.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.386
Geez, you can be
so silly sometimes.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.455
Everybody out.
This is a carjack.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.557
Well, of course this is a car.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.427
But my name's not Jack--
it's Greg.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.229
And this is
my sister Marcia.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.363
Hi.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.331
And you are?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.899
Eddie. Wait a minute.
Didn't you hear me?

14:25.933 --> 14:26.934
Get out now!

14:26.967 --> 14:28.601
This is a carjacking.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.403
Greg, I think
he has a flat tire.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.139
He must need a jack.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.140
Sorry, Eddie.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.108
We don't have a jack.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.376
But don't worry.
I'll call AAA

14:36.409 --> 14:37.410
as soon as we
get to school.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.312
It was so nice to meet you.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.313
Bye-bye.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.381
( horn honking )

14:41.414 --> 14:43.483
MAN:
Hey, you moron!

14:43.516 --> 14:45.452
Out of the way, jerk!

14:46.619 --> 14:48.922
Now, don't worry
about the house, honey.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.591
I'm sure Mr. Phillips
will advance me the money.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.293
Oh, of course he will.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.495
You're the best
player on his team.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.464
Mmm. Go get 'em, tiger.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.968
Tiger... Tiger...

15:01.001 --> 15:03.603
Whatever happened to that dog?

15:03.636 --> 15:04.637
Ha! Brady.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.273
Morning,
Larry.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.309
You know, I was just reading
about some beautiful property

15:09.342 --> 15:10.477
available up in Utah.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.346
I'll bet you'd feel
right at home there.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.548
Blue skies,
clean living, Osmonds.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.618
Thanks, Larry, but I'm
still not interested in moving.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.087
I love this house.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.056
Carol loves it, the kids
love it, Alice loves it.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.358
It was our first house
all together.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.160
Half a mil--
take it or leave it.

15:27.194 --> 15:31.331
Like I said, there's nothing
that could get us to sell.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.600
I designed this house myself.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.468
It's in perfect condition.

15:35.502 --> 15:39.606
Carol thinks so, the kids
think so, Alice thinks so.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.374
Sorry.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.544
Well, you can't blame a guy
for trying, huh?

15:44.577 --> 15:48.181
( laughing )

15:49.616 --> 15:51.084
Putz.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.528
Uh... excuse me,
Mr. Dittmeyer...

16:01.561 --> 16:03.496
but, as a member
of the safety patrol,

16:03.530 --> 16:06.033
I must warn you
that your hedge is overgrown

16:06.066 --> 16:08.001
and can block the view
of the street

16:08.035 --> 16:09.136
for oncoming traffic.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.038
I know this
because I was on my bike

16:11.071 --> 16:13.140
and checked out
the sight lines myself.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.774
Hmm. Well, you see, Billy...

16:14.807 --> 16:15.575
Bobby.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.010
Like it matters.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.611
I grew my hedge tall
for a reason.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.582
So I wouldn't have
to see your family.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.651
Thank you for your concern.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.627
( horn honking )

16:34.661 --> 16:35.728
( glass breaking )

16:35.762 --> 16:37.130
MAN:
Loco! Loco!

16:37.164 --> 16:38.565
( alarm blaring )

16:38.598 --> 16:42.069
You are standing too close
to the vehicle.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.537
* I've seen the future,
and this is... *

16:51.578 --> 16:53.546
( horn honking )

17:03.723 --> 17:05.692
* ...warmer, girl

17:05.724 --> 17:08.161
* Making the music softer...

17:11.664 --> 17:12.799
See you later.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.707
Hey, there, groovy chick.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.242
Oh, great.

17:22.275 --> 17:26.313
Do I look like a yellow,
fuzzy baby bird to you?

17:26.346 --> 17:27.780
Hey, that's funny, Donna.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.517
You know, you are
really happening
in a far-out way.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.718
How about you and me

17:31.751 --> 17:33.586
going out for a soda
after school?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.455
Sorry. I got a step class.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.290
If you're
having problems
with your steps

17:37.324 --> 17:39.759
maybe you should
let me carry your
books to history class.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.762
I can hold my own books,
and it's not history--

17:42.795 --> 17:44.531
it's "herstory."

17:44.564 --> 17:45.732
Wow.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.738
Hi, everybody.

17:53.673 --> 17:57.644
* A goddess on a mountaintop

17:57.677 --> 18:03.316
* Was burnin'
like a silver flame... *

18:03.350 --> 18:04.317
Hey, Marcia.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.652
Hello, Doug Simpson.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.155
* And Venus was her name...

18:08.188 --> 18:10.423
God, she drives me crazy!

18:10.457 --> 18:12.559
DOUG:
I got to
have that.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.727
I live next
door to her.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.396
And she's harder
to get into

18:16.429 --> 18:18.165
than a Pearl Jam
concert.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.433
What are
you guys
talking about?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.735
Just how twisted
the Bradys are.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.870
Especially Marcia.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.705
What a retro-wannabe.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.241
I think
Peter's a babe.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.144
Well, in a Gilligan
sort of way.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.479
What, are you nuts?

18:32.512 --> 18:33.480
( bell rings )

18:33.513 --> 18:34.481
Biology.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.782
Take notes.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.751
What?

18:39.852 --> 18:41.488
* Wow!

18:41.521 --> 18:43.156
* She's got it

18:43.190 --> 18:46.593
* Yeah, baby, she's got it...

18:46.626 --> 18:48.261
( sighs )

18:48.295 --> 18:49.596
Hi, Marcia.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.763
Hi.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.765
Oh, guess what? My mom
said I can sleep over.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.900
Oh, really?

18:53.933 --> 18:55.735
That's great, Noreen.
Guess what else.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.537
Doug just
said hi to me.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.172
He is so dreamy,
isn't he?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.507
Yeah, I guess.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.508
( signs )

19:01.541 --> 19:02.909
If you like

19:02.942 --> 19:04.311
that sort
of thing.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.913
So, can I carry your books
to class?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.915
Sure, Noreen.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.684
After all, you are
my best friend.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.353
Uh-oh.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.487
Here comes Doug.

19:14.521 --> 19:14.854
Go away.

19:14.887 --> 19:15.855
Sure.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.623
No, no. Stay.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.490
Okay.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.558
No, no. Leave.

19:18.591 --> 19:18.991
Fine.

19:19.025 --> 19:19.659
No, no. Stay.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.793
And pretend
I just said

19:20.827 --> 19:22.395
something really funny.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.730
What? Oh.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.732
( laughing )

19:25.765 --> 19:26.899
DOUG:
Hi, Marcia.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.835
( laughs and snorts )

19:28.868 --> 19:29.869
What's up?

19:29.902 --> 19:30.870
Oh. Um... hi, Doug.

19:30.903 --> 19:31.938
Listen, I was
just wondering,

19:31.971 --> 19:33.273
if you're not
doing anything

19:33.306 --> 19:36.276
Friday night,
maybe you'd like to go

19:36.309 --> 19:37.710
to the dance
with me.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.612
Sure. That would be a blast.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.882
Cool. You'll hear from me.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.284
Great.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.689
He's so outtasight.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.991
( sighs )

19:52.024 --> 19:53.726
Oh, my gosh!

19:53.760 --> 19:55.395
I just remembered.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.396
What?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.630
I already told Charlie

19:57.664 --> 19:59.466
I would go to the
dance with him.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.633
So?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.236
So I can't go out
with two boys at once.

20:03.270 --> 20:07.407
I like Charlie,
but Doug is so cute.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.377
And, after all,
he is the big man on campus.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.813
Noreen, what am I going to do?

20:13.846 --> 20:17.550
This is the worst mess
I've ever gotten myself into.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.551
The worst!

20:18.585 --> 20:19.552
Oh...

20:19.586 --> 20:21.721
My life is over!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.923
( bell rings )

20:23.956 --> 20:27.427
TEACHER:
So, that is what
males experience

20:27.460 --> 20:29.762
during the onset of puberty.

20:29.796 --> 20:33.600
Now, as far as the young women
are concerned...

20:33.633 --> 20:36.403
First, we begin with ovulation
and its effect

20:36.436 --> 20:38.938
on the female body.

20:38.971 --> 20:39.806
( snoring )

20:39.839 --> 20:41.341
Peter?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.642
Yes, Miss Lynley?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.777
Why don't you come up here

20:44.811 --> 20:47.914
and take the pointer...
and we will trace

20:47.947 --> 20:50.583
the path of the ovum
through the fallopian tube,

20:50.617 --> 20:55.288
where the uterine lining
is flushed through the vagina.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.658
Ohh...

20:58.691 --> 21:00.660
Oh! Peter!

21:00.693 --> 21:02.895
Peter!

21:03.930 --> 21:06.833
So, Jan, what can
I help you with?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.501
Teen pregnancy?

21:08.535 --> 21:09.802
Bulimia?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.971
Suicidal
tendencies?

21:12.004 --> 21:15.375
No. It's
my stupid glasses.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.377
Oh.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.811
I know I should wear them.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.748
I look at myself
in the mirror every morning

21:21.781 --> 21:24.717
and I say to myself,
"Jan, put on your glasses."

21:24.751 --> 21:27.520
But then I say,
"You look like a super creep.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.821
Take them off."

21:28.855 --> 21:31.691
It's like my head tells me
to do different things

21:31.724 --> 21:32.859
and I get very confused.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.461
Inner voices?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.463
Good. That's good.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.565
Let's explore that.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.467
What does she mean,
"inner voices"?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.702
I don't think that's
any of her business.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.837
But it's her job
to ask questions.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.006
You are so dumb.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.008
I don't have "inner voices."

21:49.041 --> 21:50.710
Now, Jan,

21:50.743 --> 21:53.346
paranoid schizophrenia
is very common

21:53.380 --> 21:55.982
amongst children
of blended families.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.585
You are the middle
child, aren't you?

21:58.618 --> 21:59.752
Middle child?

21:59.786 --> 22:02.722
Don't you mean
Marcia Brady's little sister?

22:02.755 --> 22:05.858
Wait a minute.
She's just trying to help.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.160
Help? Wake up!

22:08.194 --> 22:11.464
She's just looking for
an excuse to bring up Marcia.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.899
Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!

22:12.932 --> 22:15.535
Yes! I'm in the middle!

22:15.568 --> 22:18.405
Well, it sounds like
you have a serious case

22:18.438 --> 22:19.872
of...

22:19.906 --> 22:21.841
"middle child syndrome."

22:21.874 --> 22:23.743
But you needn't worry.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.845
Here's a copy of my book...

22:27.414 --> 22:29.048
and my tapes.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.050
In the meantime,

22:31.083 --> 22:33.753
do something
to make yourself stand out--

22:33.786 --> 22:36.022
give you
your own look--

22:36.055 --> 22:38.658
apart from your siblings.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.593
A new look.

22:40.627 --> 22:41.528
That's it.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.130
Gee, thanks, Mrs. Cummings.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.066
Jan, come back

22:47.099 --> 22:48.601
when you're pregnant.

22:49.902 --> 22:53.172
And, girl, you better work.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.475
* Work it down

22:55.508 --> 22:57.176
* Do your thing...

22:57.209 --> 23:00.046
BOY:
There ain't
no justice!

23:00.079 --> 23:01.180
Hi, Holly.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.181
Hi.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.816
Can I give
you a hand?

23:03.850 --> 23:05.017
Yeah. Thanks.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.554
I'm over here.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.023
Hey...

23:11.057 --> 23:12.892
Petey.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.193
Look, Leon.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.028
It's Holly's
little friend.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.898
Hey, knock it off or I'll...

23:18.931 --> 23:20.567
Or you'll what?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.134
Dittmeyer!

23:22.168 --> 23:24.537
Do it and die.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.045
I'm going to
get you, Brady.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.983
A $20,000 advance?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.918
I'd like to, Mike,

23:38.951 --> 23:40.920
but we're still hurting
from the recession.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.090
I only have three
developers coming
all this week.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.826
Let me have a shot
at those projects, Mr. Phillips.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.928
If I can sell
one of them my design

23:48.961 --> 23:50.763
you could front me
the advance, right?

23:50.797 --> 23:53.232
Sure, but...

23:53.265 --> 23:56.803
How should I put this
delicately, Mike?

23:58.237 --> 24:02.074
Your designs
are from another time.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.578
That's kind of you to say,
Mr. Phillips.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.846
I've always thought

24:06.879 --> 24:09.115
of my style as "classic,"
as well.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.683
I'll get right to work.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.156
Well, Mr. Amir,
what do you think?

24:17.189 --> 24:18.891
I love it.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.694
But it's too...

24:21.728 --> 24:23.129
interesting.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.631
I want
something simple.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.799
A couple
of self-serve pump

24:26.833 --> 24:28.768
and a Slurpee machine.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.071
Sorry.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.143
It's only strike one,
Mr. Phillips.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.979
I've still got
two more times at bat.

24:40.012 --> 24:43.282
( whistling
a sprightly tune )

24:43.315 --> 24:45.151
Cinderella,

24:45.184 --> 24:46.819
dressed in yellow,

24:46.853 --> 24:48.154
went to the ball

24:48.187 --> 24:49.922
to kiss the fellow.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.158
Hey, Heidi, go yodel
in your own yard, huh?

24:52.191 --> 24:54.126
Okay, Mr. Dittmeyer.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.970
Whoa!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.020
Hey!

25:21.053 --> 25:22.288
Hey,
little girl!

25:24.190 --> 25:26.025
I got to get
something

25:26.058 --> 25:27.159
out of my truck.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.728
Don't let anybody

25:28.761 --> 25:30.763
touch this wire.

25:30.797 --> 25:33.265
Can you do that?
Of course.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.973
Daddy, there's a Brady
in our yard!

25:44.711 --> 25:46.713
I thought I told you

25:46.746 --> 25:47.680
to stay

25:47.714 --> 25:48.881
in your own yard.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.651
Yes. But you see, Mr. Dittmeyer,
I'm simply standing here...

25:51.684 --> 25:53.686
You know, the lisp thing
is really getting old.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.155
So why don't you hop back
on the Swiss Miss package

25:56.188 --> 25:57.724
where you belong, huh?

25:57.757 --> 25:58.991
Okay.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.326
Oh.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.329
Don't forget your jump rope.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.231
( screaming )

26:05.264 --> 26:07.967
Ohh...

26:12.739 --> 26:14.841
Try it
and you're Spam.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.142
( whimpering )

26:20.012 --> 26:22.081
Well, Mr. Brady,

26:22.114 --> 26:24.784
did you hit
a home run today?

26:24.817 --> 26:29.055
My design didn't even
make it to first base.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.161
( sighs )

26:36.763 --> 26:38.330
You know, maybe
we should think

26:38.364 --> 26:41.000
about taking
Mr. Dittmeyer
up on his offer.

26:41.033 --> 26:44.203
You're serious
about selling the house?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.072
Carol, I designed
this house myself--

26:46.105 --> 26:47.206
every color,
every brick,

26:47.239 --> 26:48.741
every sheet
of Formica.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.110
If I knew another
way out, I'd take it.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.779
But where else are
we going to find

26:52.812 --> 26:54.647
$20,000 by the end of the week?

26:54.681 --> 26:56.148
Oh, no.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.885
We're going to have
to sell our house.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.725
* Clowns never laughed before

27:05.758 --> 27:09.829
* Beanstalks
never grew *

27:09.862 --> 27:13.099
* No one ever loved...

27:14.100 --> 27:15.668
What is it, Cindy?

27:15.702 --> 27:18.237
I'm busy writing
a song for Danielle.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.873
I have to tell
you something.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.241
Okay.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.409
But I can't tell you,

27:23.442 --> 27:25.011
'cause that
would be tattling.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.078
Come on, Cindy.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.180
If it's important,
it's not tattling.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.315
I'm never
going to tell

27:29.348 --> 27:31.751
that Mom and Dad
have to sell the house

27:31.784 --> 27:33.085
because they owe

27:33.119 --> 27:34.253
$20,000.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.288
Oops.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.225
And that's why
I called this meeting.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.960
Greg, what are
we going to do?

27:40.993 --> 27:44.130
Yeah. If we don't
raise $20,000
in one week,

27:44.163 --> 27:45.264
we'll have to move.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.133
And go to a
new school.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.334
And make new friends.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.137
But, Jan, you don't
have any friends.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.272
Wait. We can
save the house.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.441
We can raise
the money ourselves.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.143
But how?

27:57.176 --> 27:59.111
Well, we can
each get jobs
and earn extra money.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.147
( voice cracking ):
Hey, neato idea.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.349
Gee, there are
so many things I'm good at.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.784
I wouldn't know
where to start.

28:04.817 --> 28:08.721
( mimicking ):
Oh, I'm just so perfect
at so many things.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.189
You're just jealous, Jan.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.324
I'm going to make
some serious cash.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.994
Oh, yeah? Well,
I bet I can make
more than you.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.128
With what, shrimpo?

28:16.162 --> 28:17.463
Your tooth fairy
money?

28:17.496 --> 28:19.165
Who are you
calling "shrimpo"?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.299
Hey, Mom always said

28:20.332 --> 28:22.301
don't play ball
in the house.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.270
( all arguing )

28:24.303 --> 28:26.205
Hey, you guys,
stop fighting!

28:26.238 --> 28:28.307
If we're going
to save this house
for Mom and Dad,

28:28.340 --> 28:29.475
we've each
got to make

28:29.508 --> 28:31.043
as much
as we can.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.078
Yeah.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.112
Yeah.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.046
Yeah.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.247
Yeah.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.892
MARCIA:
But, Jan, you don't
have any friends.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.994
You're just jealous, Jan.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.108
Jan! What are you doing?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.275
Go back
to sleep, Cindy.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.811
Jan, don't!

29:04.844 --> 29:06.913
Marcia's hair is so beautiful.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.180
Exactly. That's why

29:08.214 --> 29:11.050
I'm going to get
a lot of money

29:11.083 --> 29:12.819
when I sell it.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.857
( laughing )

29:17.890 --> 29:19.291
( screaming )

29:19.325 --> 29:20.860
Jan,

29:20.893 --> 29:22.528
what are you doing?

29:22.561 --> 29:24.263
Oh, Marcia.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.265
I love your hair.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.835
Ooh! What
a groovy hairdo.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.837
Oh, you're
so beautiful!

29:30.870 --> 29:32.304
No! She's supposed

29:32.338 --> 29:33.439
to look bad.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.242
No! Nooooo!

29:36.275 --> 29:38.510
( alarm ringing )

29:40.947 --> 29:44.383
What a horrible dream.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.887
( pretending to play )

29:51.490 --> 29:53.525
Greg, have
you gone bananas?

29:53.559 --> 29:58.064
No. I just found
a way to save our house.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.599
I'm going
to become a rock star.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.203
That's great, Greg,
but I need some advice

30:04.236 --> 30:06.205
about something
really important.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.074
See, Charlie asked
me to the dance

30:08.107 --> 30:09.308
and I said yes.

30:09.341 --> 30:12.178
Then Doug asked me,
and I said yes to him, too.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.345
What am I going to do?

30:13.379 --> 30:17.183
Well, you just tell the guy
you don't want to go with

30:17.216 --> 30:19.351
that something
suddenly came up.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.619
And that works?

30:20.652 --> 30:24.823
Sure. Girls say it
to me all the time.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.262
Hey, Marcia.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.898
Oh, hi, Charlie.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.333
I can't wait until
the dance Friday night.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.136
Oh. Um...

30:37.169 --> 30:39.438
about the dance, Charlie...

30:39.471 --> 30:42.508
well, something
suddenly came up.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.311
Oh.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.613
Oh, well,
you know, that's okay.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.315
Maybe some other time?

30:49.348 --> 30:50.883
Sure.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.218
Bye.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.419
Bye.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.122
Greg was right.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.126
Well, that takes care
of that problem.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.295
Let's see what's next.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.366
Hmm.

31:12.038 --> 31:15.007
* Clowns never laughed before

31:15.041 --> 31:17.476
* Beanstalks
never grew... *

31:17.509 --> 31:19.111
BOBBY:
"Attention!

31:19.145 --> 31:21.580
"Missing school office supplies.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.249
Reward offered."

31:23.282 --> 31:26.185
Office supplies? I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.353
Yeah.
I heard it before.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.488
You know,
I've got reward money

31:29.521 --> 31:30.923
riding on this.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.558
Now, spread 'em.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.495
Oh, come on, Mrs. Whitfield!

31:36.528 --> 31:39.098
You're going to have to do

31:39.131 --> 31:40.299
better than that!

31:49.341 --> 31:50.709
Boy, you sure have

31:50.742 --> 31:54.446
some strong thigh muscles,
Mrs. Whitfield.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.648
But I've been here
for hours!

31:56.682 --> 31:58.517
Please! You
won't regret it!

31:58.550 --> 31:59.685
I guarantee it!
Please.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.521
Weren't you ever
a kid with a dream

32:02.554 --> 32:04.256
of making something
of yourself?

32:04.290 --> 32:05.424
( sighing )

32:08.560 --> 32:11.263
( chuckling ):
"Clowns"?

32:11.297 --> 32:12.264
"Beanstalks"?

32:12.298 --> 32:15.101
What the hell is this?

32:15.134 --> 32:17.436
This is a guaranteed
gold record!

32:17.469 --> 32:20.039
* Clowns never
laughed before *

32:20.072 --> 32:21.540
* And beanstalks...

32:21.573 --> 32:23.175
No.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.444
Look, what did you say

32:25.477 --> 32:26.678
your name was again?

32:26.712 --> 32:28.514
Bravo... Johnny Bravo.

32:28.547 --> 32:29.548
Listen...

32:29.581 --> 32:30.682
"Bravo..."

32:30.716 --> 32:33.352
today's sound is raw,
with an edge.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.721
Seattle... grunge...
garage bands...

32:35.754 --> 32:38.590
Don't they have
beanstalks in Seattle?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.659
( door slams )

32:40.692 --> 32:44.130
Well, hey, there,
groovy chick.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.632
Mmm... uh-uh.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.200
Yeah. It went fabulous.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.436
Put the head back on, Fletcher.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.471
Listen, I am closing in
on the, uh...

32:52.504 --> 32:53.739
on the Bradys, though.

32:53.772 --> 32:54.540
( phone rings )

32:54.573 --> 32:56.208
Can I call you back,
Mr. Feldman?

32:56.242 --> 32:57.409
My car phone's ringing.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.213
Hello.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.748
WOMAN:
Hello. I'm calling
from a marketing firm.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.384
We'd just like
a few minutes of your time...

33:05.417 --> 33:06.418
Ow!

33:06.452 --> 33:08.154
( groaning )

33:08.187 --> 33:10.556
Do you ever use
pens and pencils?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.058
I know you do...

33:13.592 --> 33:15.561
Oh, hi, Mrs. Dittmeyer!

33:15.594 --> 33:18.097
I'm here to see Eric.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.098
Oh, hi, Greggie.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.400
Oh, Greg...

33:21.433 --> 33:22.601
I'm so glad
you're here.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.470
I've got some more
of your mail.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.571
( chuckling ):
Oh.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.606
Oh, gee, your
hands are full.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.275
Let me just...

33:31.743 --> 33:33.312
My, you've...

33:33.345 --> 33:34.346
gotten so big.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.582
You're almost as big
as your daddy.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.584
And I'm still growing.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.153
Right... before
my very eyes.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.590
Your pants are...
so tight.

33:44.623 --> 33:45.791
Hey, Mrs.
Dittmeyer.

33:45.824 --> 33:46.792
Peter!

33:46.825 --> 33:48.560
Can I mow
your lawn?

33:48.594 --> 33:51.297
I'm trying to earn
some extra money.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.598
Sure.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.800
( chuckling ):
Two Bradys...

33:54.833 --> 33:57.136
Tell you what--
when you boys are done,

33:57.169 --> 34:00.206
why don't you come inside
and help me make a sandwich?

34:09.514 --> 34:12.318
Penny for your thoughts.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.820
How about 20,000
of them?

34:14.853 --> 34:17.389
You're worried about
the house, aren't you?

34:17.422 --> 34:19.690
I told you I'd take care
of everything.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.431
Oh, Mike, it's just that
we're so happy here.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.533
I sure would miss
our kitchen

34:27.565 --> 34:28.734
and our garden...

34:28.766 --> 34:29.835
and Alice!

34:29.868 --> 34:30.702
If we lose her,

34:30.735 --> 34:32.603
who'll make the
lunches I pass out?

34:32.638 --> 34:34.239
And who'll
answer the phone:

34:34.273 --> 34:35.841
( imitating Alice ):
"Brady residence."

34:35.873 --> 34:37.376
And who'll help me...

34:37.409 --> 34:41.480
Honey, Alice isn't going
anywhere, and neither are we.

34:41.513 --> 34:45.751
Besides, she doesn't do
everything around her.

34:48.587 --> 34:52.123
Time to put your
bookmark in, Mr. Brady.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.231
( snoring )

35:02.434 --> 35:07.273
I sure am glad your mom
let you sleep over

35:07.306 --> 35:09.141
on a school night.

35:09.175 --> 35:13.212
Marcia, I have to
tell you something.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.613
Hmm?

35:14.646 --> 35:19.651
You are the prettiest girl
in the entire school.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.253
I know.

35:21.287 --> 35:25.557
But how can I use my good looks
and sparkling personality

35:25.591 --> 35:28.194
to make money
and save our house?

35:29.795 --> 35:31.763
That's it!

35:31.797 --> 35:35.401
I could be a teen model!

35:35.434 --> 35:36.902
Oh, thanks, Noreen!

35:36.935 --> 35:38.937
You're the greatest!

35:38.970 --> 35:40.672
Oh...

35:42.774 --> 35:44.310
Noreen?

35:44.343 --> 35:45.411
Hmm?

35:45.444 --> 35:46.878
Is that you?

35:46.912 --> 35:48.214
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.216
I thought that was
my leg.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.483
Oh...

35:51.517 --> 35:53.319
Night.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.287
Sweet dreams, Marcia.

36:00.692 --> 36:03.729
I still don't know why
you had to tag along.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.863
This is my thing.

36:04.896 --> 36:09.301
You're not the only one
who can be a model, you know.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.539
Ooh... those are
pretty pictures.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.941
What have you
modeled for?

36:15.974 --> 36:17.943
Guess.

36:17.976 --> 36:21.947
Um... are you
a Breck girl?

36:21.980 --> 36:23.282
No. "Guess" jeans.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.351
Okay, um...

36:25.384 --> 36:27.319
Levis... Wrangler...

36:27.353 --> 36:29.521
Oshkosh B'Gosh?

36:29.555 --> 36:30.589
WOMAN:
Brady girls?

36:30.622 --> 36:32.324
That's us.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.826
So... you're
professional models?

36:34.860 --> 36:37.463
Yes, we are!
Of course!

36:37.496 --> 36:39.698
So, what do you
have to show me?

36:39.731 --> 36:41.300
Plenty.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.204
( exotic music playing )

37:00.919 --> 37:02.854
( stops music )

37:04.022 --> 37:05.724
Oh...

37:05.757 --> 37:07.526
Why don't we
take five?

37:07.559 --> 37:08.894
You.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.530
Wow...

37:15.801 --> 37:17.035
Thank you!

37:17.068 --> 37:18.704
Why does everyone
always choose Marcia?!

37:18.737 --> 37:20.572
What does she have
that I don't have?!

37:20.606 --> 37:24.376
Now, Marcia, I may
be able to use you,

37:24.410 --> 37:26.712
but first, you're
going to have to do

37:26.745 --> 37:28.447
a little work on yourself.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.916
You mean like walking
with a book on my head?

37:30.949 --> 37:32.918
No. I mean like
cutting that mousy hair,

37:32.951 --> 37:33.952
capping those teeth

37:33.985 --> 37:36.788
and losing about 30 pounds,
my little sausage.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.790
How do you feel about

37:38.824 --> 37:40.892
breast implants?

37:40.926 --> 37:43.695
Cut my hair?!

37:43.729 --> 37:44.963
( sighing )

37:48.800 --> 37:51.637
And, after much
consideration, Mr. Swanson,

37:51.670 --> 37:54.940
I designed a structure
especially for your needs.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.475
So, what do you think?

37:56.508 --> 37:59.345
SWANSON:
Well, it's just
too good a design

37:59.378 --> 38:00.946
for a fast food joint.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.081
You see what I'm saying,
Phillips?

38:03.114 --> 38:06.452
This is... I think you're
pumping a dry well here.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.454
You understand
what I'm saying?

38:08.487 --> 38:09.087
All right.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.356
I'll be in touch with you.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.557
Sorry, Mikey.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.994
Well... strike two.

38:19.565 --> 38:23.902
There's got to be a way
to make $20,000.

38:25.771 --> 38:26.672
Hey!

38:26.705 --> 38:29.375
"Search for the Stars
is looking

38:29.408 --> 38:31.343
"for fresh young musical acts.

38:31.377 --> 38:34.513
First prize: $20,000."

38:34.546 --> 38:35.781
Hmm...

38:35.814 --> 38:38.417
Too bad I'm not a musical act.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.752
Hey, Marcia!

38:40.786 --> 38:44.790
I'm not Marcia! I'm Jan!

38:44.823 --> 38:46.124
The usual, Sam.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.893
Sure thing, Mrs. Brady.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.462
20 pounds of ground round
coming right up.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.398
Carol, are you still
eating red meat?

38:52.431 --> 38:54.533
Why, of course!
I've got growing kids!

38:54.566 --> 38:56.602
I have to think
about their health!

38:56.635 --> 38:57.936
Isn't Sam

38:57.969 --> 38:59.438
the best?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.407
We're sure going to miss
this place when we move,

39:01.440 --> 39:02.040
won't we?

39:02.073 --> 39:03.542
Oh, we're not moving.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.811
You're not? I thought everyone
on the block was.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.913
Mike says there's
no reason to sell.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.381
We'll be here forever.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.417
There you go, Mrs. Brady.

39:11.450 --> 39:14.019
Thanks, Sam.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.388
Have a nice day.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.689
Bye, Sam.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.057
Bye.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.965
Marcia, could you call
the troops to dinner?

39:26.998 --> 39:28.400
In a second.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.936
I'm just checking
for a letter from Davy Jones.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.003
Nothing.

39:32.037 --> 39:35.774
Oh, Alice, if I don't get
an answer from him soon,

39:35.807 --> 39:39.044
I'll be the most humiliated girl
in the world.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.914
You think waiting three weeks
for an answer is rough?

39:42.948 --> 39:45.684
Try waiting 20 years
for the question.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.420
Alice.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.057
Hey, Greg, you're
the Casanova
of Clinton Avenue.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.625
How can I get Holly
to go for me?

39:53.659 --> 39:55.994
Well, chicks
love compliments, man.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.829
Just tell her
how groovy she is.

39:57.863 --> 39:58.997
And that really works?

39:59.030 --> 40:00.832
Trust me. It always
gets a reaction.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.668
Now, throw me a pass.

40:02.701 --> 40:05.904
24, 32, set, hike.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.742
Dinner's ready... Ooh, my nose!

40:12.544 --> 40:13.845
Are you all right?

40:13.879 --> 40:15.847
Oh, gee,
I'm sorry, Marcia.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.082
Yeah, me, too.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.685
CAROL:
Let's have
a look, Marcia.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.524
I look awful, just awful.

40:25.557 --> 40:29.728
I can never show my face
in school again.

40:29.761 --> 40:30.929
I'm ruined.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.999
Sweetheart, I know
you feel terrible,

40:34.032 --> 40:36.635
but it's going
to get better.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.237
I'm sure no one
will ever notice.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.872
Oh, my goodness.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.941
What happened to your...?

40:45.076 --> 40:46.945
mother's
favorite picture?

40:46.978 --> 40:48.079
It's crooked.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.015
I mean the painting's crooked.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.484
I think
I'd better go.

40:52.518 --> 40:53.885
I think I hear the nose boy.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.020
I mean the newsboy.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.856
Oh, boy, did I blow it.

40:59.925 --> 41:02.060
Now I'll never be a teen model.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.662
I'll never be anything.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.564
What's the point of living?

41:05.597 --> 41:06.965
I might as well die.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.806
Don't forget my
$10 reward money.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.543
I made more
than you--
almost $12.

41:17.576 --> 41:20.512
Well, I got $15
from Mrs. Dittmeyer.

41:20.546 --> 41:22.648
Boy, is she
a good tipper.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.751
But we're still
nowhere near $20,000.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.619
This is just awful.

41:27.653 --> 41:29.054
You can say that again.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.922
Tonight's the school dance

41:30.956 --> 41:33.559
and my nose
still hasn't gone down.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.027
Hey, I saw something

41:36.061 --> 41:38.697
on the bulletin board at school

41:38.730 --> 41:41.032
about a "Search
for the Stars" contest.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.034
They're looking for fresh,

41:43.068 --> 41:44.703
young musical groups.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.972
First prize is exactly $20,000.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.940
Oh, sure, Jan,
like we'd really win.

41:48.974 --> 41:49.741
Oh, Jan...

41:49.775 --> 41:51.209
We'd never have
a chance of winning.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.043
We might as well
rob a bank.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.945
Guys, there's no point
in fighting.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.681
We're running out of time,
and we still have to find

41:55.714 --> 41:57.315
a way out of this mess.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.951
I sure am going
to miss this house.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.052
Uh-oh.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.154
Here comes Mom and Dad.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.090
All right, now,
remember, everyone, act happy.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.124
We can't let on

42:06.157 --> 42:07.659
that we know anything.

42:07.693 --> 42:11.129
( all laughing )

42:11.162 --> 42:16.234
Mike, you don't think the kids
suspect anything, do you?

42:16.267 --> 42:18.303
Oh, no, of course not.

42:18.336 --> 42:22.974
Well, just to make sure,
we should act extra happy.

42:23.008 --> 42:27.078
Well, you know
what makes us the happiest.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.747
ALL:
Potato sack race!

42:28.780 --> 42:30.081
ALICE:
Get ready...

42:30.115 --> 42:31.149
get set...

42:31.182 --> 42:32.851
go!

42:32.884 --> 42:35.621
( all cheering )

42:35.654 --> 42:36.988
So, what can
I do you for?

42:37.022 --> 42:38.056
You can explain to me

42:38.089 --> 42:40.091
what Mrs. Brady told my wife.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.160
Yeah, if Mike Brady
won't sell,

42:42.193 --> 42:44.596
we're all screwed.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.765
Well, allow me
to take this opportunity

42:46.798 --> 42:48.133
to set the record straight.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.902
The Bradys are selling,
my clients are buying

42:50.936 --> 42:53.171
and you are all making out
like bandits.

42:53.204 --> 42:55.641
Scotch, Steve?
Are you calling
my wife a liar?

42:55.674 --> 42:56.975
Steve, no.

42:57.008 --> 42:59.611
I'm just saying
you can't believe the Bradys.

42:59.645 --> 43:02.981
You've all seen the insane stuff
that goes on over there.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.183
How about this
Astroturf lawn

43:05.216 --> 43:07.619
they treat like
real grass, huh?

43:07.653 --> 43:08.954
And, excuse me...

43:08.987 --> 43:11.890
the family that's happy
all the time?

43:11.923 --> 43:13.024
Not possible.

43:13.058 --> 43:16.394
It is strange how they
spend their weekends--

43:16.427 --> 43:18.830
hopping around
in potato sacks.

43:18.864 --> 43:20.365
And you know
something?
Yeah.

43:20.398 --> 43:23.101
I hear that their maid
works for free.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.070
Can you understand that?

43:25.103 --> 43:26.204
No.
I can't. No.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.073
You know,
I was over there once.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.141
One bathroom
for nine people?

43:30.175 --> 43:31.409
Get out of here.
Oh, stop, please.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.712
And I never did see
a toilet.

43:33.745 --> 43:36.414
Please, they've got
to put it somewhere.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.749
Come on.

43:37.783 --> 43:39.184
I rest my case.

43:40.218 --> 43:41.987
( doorbell rings )

43:42.020 --> 43:43.989
Hi. I'm Doug Simpson.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.290
Marcia's date?

43:45.323 --> 43:48.059
Oh, right--
the big man on campus.

43:48.093 --> 43:49.194
Come on in, Doug.

43:49.227 --> 43:51.129
Marcia, Doug's here!

43:52.731 --> 43:54.165
CAROL:
Hi, Doug.

43:54.199 --> 43:57.102
Big man on campus, huh?

43:57.135 --> 43:59.070
Yeah, right.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.676
Hi, Doug.

44:04.710 --> 44:06.011
Hi, Marcia.

44:06.044 --> 44:07.245
Is anything wrong?

44:09.014 --> 44:11.316
Sweetheart, I think
you better show him.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.927
I suppose you don't want
to go out with me now, huh?

44:21.960 --> 44:23.261
Oh, of course I do.

44:23.294 --> 44:25.096
It's not your nose I'm after.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.134
That's a fine boy

44:29.167 --> 44:31.069
Marcia's got there.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.938
Oh, Marcia,
it looks like rain.

44:32.971 --> 44:34.806
You better take
your shawl.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.007
Thanks.

44:36.041 --> 44:37.375
Uh, Doug, how about you?

44:37.408 --> 44:39.878
Do you have
any protection?

44:39.911 --> 44:40.979
Oh, yes, ma'am.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.914
Assorted colors
and textures.

44:42.948 --> 44:44.182
Good for you.

44:44.215 --> 44:46.117
MIKE:
Have fun, kids.

44:46.151 --> 44:47.919
Bye-bye.

44:47.953 --> 44:51.189
* Are you coming with me?

44:53.258 --> 44:56.161
But, Doug, this isn't
the school dance.

44:56.194 --> 44:59.264
I just figured
we'd come up here and
unwind a little bit

44:59.297 --> 45:00.431
before we go down.

45:00.465 --> 45:02.734
Mind if I change
the station?

45:05.236 --> 45:06.938
( blowing )

45:06.972 --> 45:08.840
Oh, it is windy tonight.

45:08.874 --> 45:11.276
Maybe we should put
the top up.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.311
I'll keep you warm, Marcia.

45:13.344 --> 45:14.813
Uh...

45:14.846 --> 45:17.115
Doug, your hand
is on my shoulder.

45:17.148 --> 45:18.383
So?

45:18.416 --> 45:22.320
Well, that's third base,
and I don't go that far.

45:24.089 --> 45:27.325
Doug, I think I just felt
your tongue in my mouth.

45:27.358 --> 45:29.027
That's called
a French kiss, Marcia.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.930
I thought you were
from Nebraska.

45:31.963 --> 45:32.964
I am.

45:32.998 --> 45:35.767
Listen, Doug, I don't know
what you were thinking,

45:35.801 --> 45:37.435
but I don't do things
like that.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.204
You may live
your life one way,

45:39.237 --> 45:41.973
but we Bradys
follow our own drummer.

45:42.007 --> 45:45.276
So, I hope this doesn't sour
the rest of our date.

45:47.312 --> 45:49.948
You Bradys suck!

45:57.188 --> 45:58.323
Excuse me.

45:58.356 --> 45:59.490
Oh, no, thank you.

45:59.524 --> 46:01.827
I don't take rides
from strangers.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.261
I was just wondering

46:03.294 --> 46:05.496
how to get
to West Dale High School.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.198
West Dale High?

46:07.232 --> 46:09.100
* How do you do?

46:09.134 --> 46:10.335
* Yeah

46:10.368 --> 46:12.770
( rock music playing )

46:20.545 --> 46:22.447
* So now I'm pissed off

46:22.480 --> 46:24.415
* My head is a twist-off

46:24.449 --> 46:26.251
* I never have been cute

46:26.284 --> 46:29.587
* I need more money
'cause my life is crummy *

46:29.620 --> 46:32.190
* And get that stuff
off my shoe *

46:32.223 --> 46:36.261
* It is a cruel world,
I'm no schoolgirl *

46:36.294 --> 46:38.096
* I never do what I should

46:38.129 --> 46:41.099
* And they never know,
it's about to blow... *

46:41.132 --> 46:42.600
Hey, you're
one groovy chick.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.303
You're really happening
in a far-out way.

46:45.336 --> 46:47.939
( laughing ):
Thanks.

46:47.973 --> 46:49.908
( song continues in background)

46:58.616 --> 47:00.018
( laughs )

47:04.189 --> 47:05.356
( gasps )

47:05.390 --> 47:06.524
( moans )

47:06.557 --> 47:08.359
Peter!

47:18.436 --> 47:19.504
Yeah!

47:19.537 --> 47:21.506
( applause and cheering )

47:28.446 --> 47:29.480
Excuse me.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.482
Can I have your attention,
please?

47:31.516 --> 47:34.319
You may all know me
as Greg Brady,

47:34.352 --> 47:37.222
but tonight,
I'd like to introduce you to...

47:37.255 --> 47:39.190
Johnny Bravo!

47:41.059 --> 47:43.394
( plays out of tune chords )

47:44.395 --> 47:45.330
For my first song,

47:45.363 --> 47:47.365
I'd like to sing
a number I wrote

47:47.398 --> 47:50.035
for the grooviest chick
at West Dale High.

47:50.068 --> 47:51.369
( people screaming )

47:51.402 --> 47:52.303
One, two

47:52.337 --> 47:54.339
three, four...

47:54.372 --> 47:58.109
* Clowns never laughed before

47:58.143 --> 48:01.479
* Beanstalks never grew

48:01.512 --> 48:04.983
* Ponies never ran before

48:05.016 --> 48:09.054
( punk music drowning out song)

48:14.025 --> 48:16.928
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

48:19.998 --> 48:23.268
* Does it scare you

48:23.301 --> 48:24.402
* When you see me
lose my mind... *

48:24.435 --> 48:25.470
( gasps )

48:25.503 --> 48:26.471
* I go crazy...

48:26.504 --> 48:27.973
Hi, everybody.

48:28.006 --> 48:29.975
It's the new Jan Brady.

48:30.008 --> 48:32.978
Am I a hit?

48:33.011 --> 48:34.445
Do you like it?

48:34.479 --> 48:36.447
( yelling )

48:36.481 --> 48:38.683
( music stops )

48:38.716 --> 48:40.485
Hmm.

48:40.518 --> 48:42.988
Wow. It worked.

48:43.021 --> 48:45.356
I really did make a splash.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.526
Can I have your attention,
please?

48:48.559 --> 48:49.560
I have some news

48:49.594 --> 48:51.562
that's going to make
everyone flip.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.431
Hey... what about me?

48:53.464 --> 48:55.100
I thought
he might show up,

48:55.133 --> 48:57.268
but I didn't want
to get all your hopes up.

48:57.302 --> 48:59.470
Marcia did it again.

48:59.504 --> 49:01.739
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!

49:01.772 --> 49:04.009
But here he is--

49:04.042 --> 49:05.410
Davy Jones!

49:05.443 --> 49:07.312
( one person clapping )

49:07.345 --> 49:08.413
BOY:
Hey, Grandpa...

49:08.446 --> 49:09.547
GIRL:
Oh, man!

49:09.580 --> 49:11.983
Thanks a lot for
being here, Davy...

49:12.017 --> 49:13.684
I mean, Mr. Jones.

49:13.718 --> 49:16.554
Anything for my
number-one fan.

49:16.587 --> 49:18.489
( cooing and gasping )

49:20.158 --> 49:23.995
( pop music piano introduction)

49:28.133 --> 49:30.135
* Girl

49:30.168 --> 49:33.038
* Look what you've done to me

49:33.071 --> 49:35.140
Look, it really is Davy Jones!

49:35.173 --> 49:36.307
* Me

49:37.442 --> 49:39.477
* And my whole world

49:42.580 --> 49:44.549
* Girl

49:44.582 --> 49:45.616
* You've brought

49:45.650 --> 49:48.786
* The sun to me

49:48.819 --> 49:52.323
* With your smile

49:52.357 --> 49:54.592
* You did it, girl

49:54.625 --> 49:56.261
( loud rock music joining in)

49:56.294 --> 49:59.230
* I'm telling you, girl

49:59.264 --> 50:00.465
* Something not

50:00.498 --> 50:02.700
* Known to me

50:03.834 --> 50:05.570
* Makes

50:05.603 --> 50:07.538
* You what you are...

50:07.572 --> 50:09.040
Hi, Charlie.

50:09.074 --> 50:10.275
Hey, Marcia.

50:10.308 --> 50:12.443
It was rude of me
to break our date.

50:12.477 --> 50:14.612
How can I make
it up to you?

50:14.645 --> 50:18.449
Well, uh... gee, Marcia,
how about a dance?

50:18.483 --> 50:21.352
Why, I'd love to,
Charlie Anderson.

50:21.386 --> 50:24.689
* ...that way, girl

50:24.722 --> 50:26.357
* Thank you, girl

50:26.391 --> 50:29.194
* For making
the morning brighter *

50:29.227 --> 50:30.328
* Girl

50:30.361 --> 50:32.630
* For making
the nighttime nicer *

50:32.663 --> 50:33.631
* Girl

50:33.664 --> 50:36.101
* For making a better world

50:36.134 --> 50:38.636
* For me

50:38.669 --> 50:41.272
* I'm telling you, girl

50:42.473 --> 50:45.476
* Something unknown to me

50:47.312 --> 50:48.446
* Makes

50:49.680 --> 50:52.517
* You what you are

50:53.584 --> 50:56.421
* And what you are

50:56.454 --> 50:59.590
* Is all that I want for me

51:00.891 --> 51:02.393
* And it's good

51:02.427 --> 51:07.532
* To feel that way, girl

51:07.565 --> 51:08.866
* Thank you, girl

51:08.899 --> 51:12.370
* For making the winter warmer

51:12.403 --> 51:13.404
* Girl

51:13.438 --> 51:16.241
* For making the music softer

51:16.274 --> 51:17.408
* Girl

51:17.442 --> 51:21.179
* For making a better world
for me *

51:21.212 --> 51:23.481
( shrieking guitar riff )

51:34.192 --> 51:37.695
* And what you are

51:37.728 --> 51:42.633
* Is all that I want for me

51:42.667 --> 51:44.435
* And it's good

51:44.469 --> 51:47.638
* To feel that way, girl

51:47.672 --> 51:49.874
( moaning and shrieking )

51:49.907 --> 51:51.476
* Thank you, girl

51:53.744 --> 51:55.780
* Thank you, girl

51:56.847 --> 52:00.651
* Thank you, girl...

52:00.685 --> 52:04.155
( cheering )

52:08.693 --> 52:11.629
( wild cheering and applause)

52:15.866 --> 52:17.902
Hey, where are you going?

52:17.935 --> 52:20.438
Something suddenly came up.

52:22.607 --> 52:25.310
Hey, Marcia,
you looked great up there.

52:25.343 --> 52:26.744
Thanks, Noreen.

52:28.346 --> 52:30.681
Hey, Marcia,
you got a sec?

52:30.715 --> 52:32.417
Forget it, Doug.

52:32.450 --> 52:33.718
Even with a swollen nose,

52:33.751 --> 52:35.420
I can still smell a rat.

52:40.591 --> 52:41.759
Slut.

52:46.764 --> 52:49.567
Um... Marcia, would
you get our coats.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.303
I have a little, uh...
matter to discuss.

52:53.371 --> 52:54.572
Sure, Charlie.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.275
Hey...

52:57.308 --> 52:58.743
I heard what
you said, Doug...

52:58.776 --> 53:01.812
and I'm not going
to let you talk
to Marcia like that.

53:01.846 --> 53:02.947
Yeah?

53:02.980 --> 53:04.749
Yeah.
Well, what
are you going

53:04.782 --> 53:05.950
to do about it, geek?

53:05.983 --> 53:08.619
I-I'm going to... lose...

53:09.854 --> 53:11.689
consciousness.
Hey, Doug.

53:13.324 --> 53:13.858
How's about

53:13.891 --> 53:15.460
a little punch?

53:20.365 --> 53:21.566
Is he dead?

53:25.503 --> 53:26.937
Wow.

53:26.971 --> 53:29.674
Charlie, thanks.

53:35.446 --> 53:37.715
Couldn't have
done it better myself.

53:44.355 --> 53:45.623
Here.

53:51.496 --> 53:53.631
Are you okay?

54:00.338 --> 54:02.807
I really had
a great time, Marcia.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.842
Yeah, me, too, Charlie.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.912
Well, uh...

54:07.945 --> 54:10.014
Bye. Bye.

54:10.047 --> 54:12.016
Uh, Marcia?

54:12.049 --> 54:15.486
So, um... can, uh...

54:15.520 --> 54:17.888
can I have a kiss
good night?

54:17.922 --> 54:19.624
Yeah.

54:19.657 --> 54:21.359
Okay, Charlie.

54:27.932 --> 54:29.434
Marcia...

54:29.467 --> 54:32.370
I think I just felt
your tongue in my mouth.

54:32.403 --> 54:34.705
It's called a French kiss,
Charlie.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.974
Um... Marcia, I got to go.

54:37.007 --> 54:39.944
Uh, something
suddenly came up.

54:44.482 --> 54:46.384
( car pulling away )

54:57.462 --> 54:59.430
BOY:
32, 24, hike.

54:59.464 --> 55:00.731
Dinner's ready.

55:02.733 --> 55:04.902
Oh, my nose!

55:04.935 --> 55:06.437
( sighing )

55:08.906 --> 55:11.909
What a nice dream.

55:11.942 --> 55:13.344
( screams )

55:13.378 --> 55:15.846
Jan, what is it?

55:15.880 --> 55:17.448
Has my nose gotten worse?

55:17.482 --> 55:20.385
No. It's better.

55:20.418 --> 55:22.387
( gasps )

55:28.793 --> 55:31.862
The hardest thing
about the health club business

55:31.896 --> 55:34.365
is getting people
to leave their house.

55:34.399 --> 55:37.067
Well... what do you think?

55:37.101 --> 55:38.469
I love it.

55:38.503 --> 55:41.472
( speaking Japanese )

55:41.506 --> 55:44.008
Consider yourself hired.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.949
( bat hits ball )

55:51.982 --> 55:54.051
( stadium crowd cheers )

55:56.487 --> 55:57.488
Uh-huh.

55:57.522 --> 55:59.156
You would?

55:59.189 --> 56:00.958
I see.

56:00.991 --> 56:02.727
Ahh.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.029
All right.

56:05.062 --> 56:06.464
( growls )

56:12.737 --> 56:14.371
Mom, Dad?

56:24.148 --> 56:26.751
Hey, why the gloom?

56:26.784 --> 56:28.586
Well, we just had
a kid meeting

56:28.619 --> 56:29.887
and, well, we decided

56:29.920 --> 56:32.457
that we don't mind
if we have to move.

56:32.490 --> 56:33.491
We tried

56:33.524 --> 56:36.527
to raise the money for
the tax bill ourselves,

56:36.561 --> 56:38.529
but there are only
two days left

56:38.563 --> 56:40.931
and all we
could come up
with was $110.

56:40.965 --> 56:42.533
What?

56:42.567 --> 56:44.034
How did you know
about the house

56:44.068 --> 56:45.402
and the tax bill?

56:48.105 --> 56:49.440
Oops!

56:49.474 --> 56:50.941
Cindy, do I have
to remind you

56:50.975 --> 56:52.610
that when you tattle
on somebody,

56:52.643 --> 56:55.646
you're not just telling on them,
you're telling on yourself

56:55.680 --> 56:57.081
and...

56:57.114 --> 56:59.817
ALL:
Telling them
that you're a tattletale.

56:59.850 --> 57:01.519
We've heard
it, Dad. Thanks.

57:01.552 --> 57:04.989
Kids, you have nothing
to worry about.

57:05.022 --> 57:07.592
Today your father
sold a design

57:07.625 --> 57:11.028
and now he can get
that $20,000 advance.

57:11.061 --> 57:12.563
( all exclaim )

57:12.597 --> 57:14.599
I appreciate
what you all tried to do

57:14.632 --> 57:16.467
and from now on,
no more secrets.

57:16.501 --> 57:18.235
The important thing is

57:18.268 --> 57:19.504
we still have our home

57:19.537 --> 57:20.838
so, let's celebrate.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.773
Put on
your Sunday best, kids.

57:22.807 --> 57:24.074
We're going to Sears.

57:24.108 --> 57:25.510
( all exclaiming )

57:31.215 --> 57:34.819
* I think I'll go for a walk
outside now *

57:34.852 --> 57:37.121
* The summer sun's
calling my name *

57:37.154 --> 57:38.288
* I hear ya now *

57:38.322 --> 57:42.026
* I just can't stay inside
all day *

57:42.059 --> 57:46.631
* I gotta get out,
get me some of those rays *

57:46.664 --> 57:48.265
* Everybody's smilin' *

57:48.298 --> 57:50.100
* Sunshine day *

57:50.134 --> 57:54.905
* Everybody
seems so happy today *

57:54.939 --> 57:56.574
* It's a sunshine day *

57:56.607 --> 57:59.944
* I think I'll go for a walk
outside now *

57:59.977 --> 58:02.513
* The summer sun
knows me by name *

58:02.547 --> 58:03.648
* He's a-calling me... *

58:03.681 --> 58:06.584
Hey, everybody,
look at Alice.

58:10.688 --> 58:11.756
Outtasight.

58:11.789 --> 58:13.023
Neato.

58:13.057 --> 58:15.626
And I thought
Sam had magic fingers.

58:15.660 --> 58:16.794
( all laugh )

58:16.827 --> 58:19.296
ALL:
Oh, Alice.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.799
( all laughing )

58:24.702 --> 58:25.970
Hey, everybody, look.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.538
Come on, gang,
let's have a look.

58:27.572 --> 58:29.306
* I think I'll take
a walk every day now *

58:29.339 --> 58:32.076
I'm on TV.

58:32.109 --> 58:34.111
* The summer sun's
shown me the way *

58:34.144 --> 58:35.279
* To be happy now *

58:35.312 --> 58:38.583
* I just can't stay inside
all day *

58:38.616 --> 58:42.887
* I gotta get out,
get me some of those rays...*

58:42.920 --> 58:44.088
GIRL:
Oh, my God...

58:44.121 --> 58:45.656
Tori Spelling
is here

58:45.690 --> 58:47.592
autographing
her new perfume!

58:47.625 --> 58:49.560
( girls screaming )

58:58.335 --> 59:01.872
* I think I'll go for a walk
outside now *

59:01.906 --> 59:04.575
* The summer sun's
calling my name *

59:04.609 --> 59:05.876
* I hear ya now *

59:05.910 --> 59:09.146
* I gotta get out,
get me some of those rays *

59:09.179 --> 59:11.749
* Everybody's smilin' *

59:11.782 --> 59:13.584
* Sunshine day *

59:13.618 --> 59:15.185
* Everybody's laughin'... *

59:15.219 --> 59:16.654
LARRY:
Bill.

59:16.687 --> 59:18.055
Brady.

59:18.088 --> 59:19.757
Occupant.

59:19.790 --> 59:21.091
Bill.

59:21.125 --> 59:23.293
Brady...

59:23.327 --> 59:26.563
"Joint consolidated tax bill:
Final notice."

59:29.834 --> 59:31.602
"Dear Mr. Brady...

59:31.636 --> 59:33.738
"due to your failure to pay...

59:33.771 --> 59:39.209
house will be auctioned
2:00 p.m. tomorrow..."

59:39.243 --> 59:42.212
$20,000.

59:42.246 --> 59:43.781
Dina?

59:43.814 --> 59:45.916
Dina...

59:45.950 --> 59:49.620
this is the greatest
day of our lives.

59:49.654 --> 59:51.388
Did the kids run away?

59:51.421 --> 59:53.624
No. We are rich.

59:53.658 --> 59:58.362
We are going to be filthy,
stinking, disgustingly rich.

59:58.395 --> 59:59.363
Larry?

59:59.396 --> 01:00:00.364
Yeah?

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:03.400
Get me my ice mask.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.169
Forget your ice mask.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.737
We're going to be so rich

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.906
you can hire an Eskimo
to sit on your face.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:17.748
( knocking )

01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:18.916
It's open.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.785
Of course it is.

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:21.919
( chuckles )

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:22.953
Morning.

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:24.121
Morning, Larry.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:25.255
If you're here

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.758
about the offer,
the answer's still no.

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:29.760
I haven't changed my mind.

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:30.861
No need for that.

01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:33.097
I know
you won't be selling this house

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.066
because, after the auction
tomorrow at 2:00, I'll own it.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.402
Well, I don't think
there'll be any auction.

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:41.371
What?

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:43.207
Well, luckily,
I just sold one of my designs,

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.276
so it looks like
the Bradys are here to stay.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.948
So,
which firm was lucky enough

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:53.450
to snag one of your designs,
Mike?

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.085
LARRY:
And, of course

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.153
if you ever need
a property

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:57.287
for one of your
health clubs

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.322
I'm your man.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.724
Oh, thank you.

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:03.160
Well, well.
What have we here?

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:04.461
This is one
of our new gyms

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.096
that we're constructing.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.799
We are negotiating to buy
the design right now.

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.434
Really?
Who's your architect?

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:12.703
A very talented fellow--

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:15.139
name of Brady.

01:01:15.172 --> 01:01:17.041
I guess you won't be breaking
ground until after he dries out.

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:18.042
Dries out?

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:19.109
I really shouldn't
say anything.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.310
Guy's been
through a lot lately,

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:23.213
what with the charges filed
against him and everything.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:24.414
Charges?

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:25.950
Criminal negligence.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.819
A building he designed
completely collapsed.

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:31.956
Old folks home,
Christmas day.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:35.325
All those cute, little
visiting grandchildren...

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.827
some with puppies.

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:41.098
Let's take a moment
to honor their memory, shall we?

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.504
( square-dance music playing)

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.740
( all cheering )

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.778
( phone rings )

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:54.979
I'll get it.

01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:59.016
Brady residence.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.150
You did? I see.

01:02:00.184 --> 01:02:01.251
When?

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:02.887
Uh-huh.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.088
They did?

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:05.923
Why not?

01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:09.426
Uh-huh... oh.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:11.862
Yeah?

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:12.429
Right.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:14.765
Well...

01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:17.067
bye.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.268
Bad news, I'm afraid.

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.004
Oh, Mike. What?

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:22.272
The Flex factory pulled out
of the project this morning.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:24.208
They're not going
with my design.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.877
Oh, Mike. Why?

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:28.245
Well, they wouldn't say.

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.280
I guess this
means it's over.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:33.083
Unless a miracle happens
by 2:00 tomorrow,

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:35.786
the county is going
to auction our house.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.221
Oh, Mike. How?

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.424
Kids, I'm afraid
the money

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.794
that we were counting on
is no longer a possibility.

01:02:43.828 --> 01:02:45.529
But I want you
to remember

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:47.464
that no matter
where we go,

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.399
or whatever
house we're in,

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.369
we'll be fine as long
as we're together,

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:55.272
so I don't want to see
any more frowns.

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:56.941
We're Bradys.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.843
And as a wise
man once said:

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:01.345
"Wherever you go,
there you are."

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.949
I never thought of it
that way, Dad.

01:03:04.982 --> 01:03:07.284
MARCIA:
Thanks, Dad.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:19.196
Boy, this is crummy.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:22.266
Well, there must be
some way out of this mess.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.868
Everybody think.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.943
Hey, I've got it.

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:36.113
We can enter that
"Search for the Stars" contest.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.114
First prize

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.116
is exactly $20,000.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:40.317
Hey, that's a nifty idea,
Marcia.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:42.419
Great idea, Marcia.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:43.487
Good idea, Marcia.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.554
Am I invisible?

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:46.490
Do I not
have a voice?

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.325
I had that idea two days ago.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.094
Stop being so selfish, Jan.

01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:51.028
Come on, Jan.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.362
Oh, Jan.

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:53.363
Jan.
Jan.

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:55.199
Come on, you
guys, we got

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:56.400
a big day ahead of us.

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.535
We better get some rest
if we're going to be

01:03:58.568 --> 01:04:00.871
a fresh, young
musical group.

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:02.439
It was my idea. Mine.

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:04.308
Didn't anybody hear me?

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:06.410
GIRL:
I heard you.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:07.611
GIRL 2:
Me, too,

01:04:07.644 --> 01:04:10.580
but it sounded better
coming from Marcia.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:14.218
( chuckles )

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:22.159
Sam, that was the juiciest
Meat Cutters' Ball

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.227
I've ever been to.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.461
I'm cooked.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:27.231
Alice, I want you to
stick out your hand

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.365
and close your eyes.

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:30.167
I got a surprise for you.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.603
Unless it fits on my finger,
I've got to hit the sack.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:35.139
It better fit,

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:38.308
or I'm going to have
to take it back.

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.077
Sam, I thought this day

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.345
would never come.

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:46.150
When I saw it,

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.986
I thought
it was right up your alley.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.687
I'm bowled over.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.390
( chuckles )

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.195
I always thought
our grandchildren

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.064
would come visit us
in this house.

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.233
Oh, Mike.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.036
You know,
this is going to be

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:09.073
our last night
in this bedroom.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.411
Why, Grandpa Brady.

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:25.289
( Carol chuckling softly )

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:42.439
Jan,

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:43.607
where are you going?

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.976
Someplace where I can be
appreciated.

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.677
Go ahead and snitch if you want.

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.446
Just give me a head start.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:50.247
I wouldn't snitch.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.649
But how will we sing
without you?

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.484
Why don't you ask Marcia?

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.654
Maybe she has
another brilliant idea.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.728
( door shuts )

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:07.497
Mom? Dad?

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:09.699
( clearing throats )

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:13.403
Uh... what is it,
Cindy?

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.372
If you know something,

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:17.507
but you don't want
to be a tattle,

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:20.477
but it's very important
that you tell someone...

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.179
Cindy, let's talk about
it tomorrow.

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:23.747
But Jan could be dead by then!

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.182
What?!

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:27.284
Oops!

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.619
Why would Jan run
away like this?

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.457
Maybe we were
thinking too much
about our problems

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.792
and not enough
about the kids.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.528
Did anyone
say anything

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:40.197
that would make
Jan run away?

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:42.566
Nothing more than
what we usually
say to her.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:43.633
KIDS:
Yeah.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:46.036
I'll get Alice.

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.507
Oh.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.309
Hi, folks.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:53.477
Sam,

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.479
what are you
doing here?

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.782
Oh, I was just, um,
delivering some meat.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.484
Well, it's a good thing
you're here.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:03.053
Jan ran away,
and we need
you and Alice

01:07:03.087 --> 01:07:04.388
to help
find her.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:05.455
We'll circle
the block.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:06.690
You check the school.

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:07.791
Come on, gang,
let's go.

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:10.527
Let's go.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.597
Come on,
everybody,
hurry up.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.531
Come on.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.200
Come on, Cindy.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:17.767
I call
the way back.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.603
I got
the backseat.

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:27.477
What happened?
Did an animal die on your head?

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:28.745
( chuckling )

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:29.579
Hey, lose the hat.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.215
You'll be okay.

01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:11.355
MIKE:
Keep your eyes peeled,
everybody.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:20.229
Breaker, one-nine,
breaker, one-nine,

01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:22.131
this is Christmas Carol.

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.701
Honey, no one's answered us
in years.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.236
Oh, Mike, I have to try.

01:08:28.572 --> 01:08:32.542
Breaker, one-nine,
do you read me?

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.779
Anyone out there?

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.381
I need a 20 on a little girl.

01:08:38.415 --> 01:08:42.551
Blond, blue-eyed,
answers to the name of Jan.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:44.554
Tell her...

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:49.593
Mother Hen and Father Goose
love her very much.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:53.430
Come after me
if you're out there, over.

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:01.270
Huh. Sounds like
some family

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.573
misses somebody
they love very much.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:05.375
I don't have a family.

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:07.577
Oh, no family.

01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:08.612
You know, sometimes

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:10.747
I'm driving the
graveyard shift

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.249
in the middle
of nowhere,

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:14.718
I can't help thinking
what might have been

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:16.752
if I'd taken a
different road--

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.587
married young,
had a family--

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:19.889
three boys,
three girls.

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:22.658
Oh, then a little voice says,
"Are you kidding?

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:24.928
They'd probably just treat you
like a maid."

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:26.630
Do you want some of this, Jan?

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.232
No, thanks.

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:29.866
You have a little voice, too?

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:33.636
Mmm. Oh, honey, when you're
on the road as long as I am,

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.604
you got to talk to somebody.

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:38.707
That's a trick I
learned growing up.

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:40.944
It's tough being a middle child.

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:43.680
You're a middle child.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:44.848
So am I.

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:46.883
Then you know what it feels like

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.452
not being special.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:51.321
What does she mean,
"I'm not special?"

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:53.423
Hey, she's just trying to help.

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:54.458
My family's not much.

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:56.793
No kids, though we do have
a lot of livestock.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:59.863
( hoarse rasp ):
Jan! Oh, Jan!

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:02.232
Don't listen to her!

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:03.667
In this day and age,
if you're lucky enough...

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.934
Who is that?

01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:08.272
( hoarse rasp ):
It's me-- the new Jan Brady.

01:10:08.305 --> 01:10:10.374
Let's knock over a 7-Eleven.

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:11.808
Stop! You're scaring me!

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:13.243
Me, too.
Me, too!

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:24.354
Mom? Dad?

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.924
Hi. I'm back.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.726
Marcia? Cindy?

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:31.895
Are you up there?

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:36.333
Greg? Peter? Bobby?

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.703
Alice?

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.374
Sam?

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:46.443
( radio static )

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:50.013
Christmas Carol, this is
Schultzy, come back to me.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:54.518
Schultzy! Th-this
is Christmas Carol.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:56.720
I got a 20 on a little girl.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:11:01.057
Blue eyes, blonde hair,
answers to the name of Jan.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.293
( all exclaiming )

01:11:03.327 --> 01:11:07.030
I just dropped her off
at 4222 Clinton Way.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:09.299
Thank you, Schultzy,
thank you

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:10.400
and God bless!

01:11:10.434 --> 01:11:12.436
Over.

01:11:12.469 --> 01:11:14.504
That's a big ten-four.

01:11:14.538 --> 01:11:15.705
( air horn blowing )

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:17.807
( chuckling )

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:21.745
Jan?

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.812
Jan, are you here?

01:11:22.846 --> 01:11:24.781
Mom? Dad?

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:26.883
Oh, honey!

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:27.884
Oh, honey!

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:28.785
Oh, sweetheart.

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.587
I'm so glad
you're safe!

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.688
Oh, honey,

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:33.957
what on earth
made you run away?

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:36.960
I thought no one wanted me here
anymore,

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:39.763
but when I was out
in the real world,

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:42.799
I realized
that I wanted me to be here.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:44.834
You're all a part of me

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:46.736
and I'm
a part of you,

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.838
and there's no escaping that...

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:51.641
but it makes me feel
really special.

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.042
I couldn't
have put it

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.445
better myself, Jan,
but I'll try anyway.

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:56.413
See, I've always believed

01:11:56.446 --> 01:11:58.915
that it doesn't matter
where your home is,

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.884
because home
is where your heart is,

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:01.985
and we may lose
this house,

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:03.820
but we'll always
have our family

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:05.489
because
we're Bradys,

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:07.424
and this family is our home.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.926
That's why we'll
always have our home.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:11.628
As long as we have our family,

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.130
even if we lose our house,
we're still Bradys.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.566
Your father's right.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.602
( all talking at once )
Oh, yeah,
absolutely, Dad.

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:19.769
MARCIA:
Maybe we can still

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:20.770
save the house.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:21.671
How about Jan's idea

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:24.574
of the "Search for
the Stars" contest?

01:12:24.608 --> 01:12:26.476
Jan's idea?

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.811
Yes, it was Jan's,

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.813
and it's
a really great plan.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.948
CAROL:
What's "Search
for the Stars?"

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:32.949
It's a contest

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.951
for the best
musical group,

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.821
and there's a first prize
of $20,000.

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.457
And singing
one of Greg's songs,

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:41.925
we're sure to win.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:44.661
Well, then, you're going to have
to sing it without me.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:46.930
Huh?
What?
Why?

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:50.634
I thought I could change my name
and my personality

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:53.102
and become
some big, flashy rock star,

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.505
but I was just kidding myself.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:56.806
Nobody liked my act.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.876
I guess
I just don't have what it takes.

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:04.080
Well, let's face it,

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:06.750
Johnny Bravo's nothing but...

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:07.817
Johnny Rotten.

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:09.619
You're right,
son.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:12.556
Johnny Bravo doesn't have
what it takes...

01:13:12.589 --> 01:13:13.823
but Greg Brady does.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:15.559
He has us,

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:17.761
and this family
can accomplish anything.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:20.897
Alone, we can only move buckets,
but if we work together,

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:21.831
we can drain rivers.

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:22.932
Your father's
right.

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:25.001
The eight of us
separate

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:26.169
are just eight...

01:13:26.202 --> 01:13:28.672
well, with Alice, we're nine,
but nine...

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:29.906
Yes, well, technically...

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:30.974
And with Sam, ten,

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:33.943
but ten separate,
just ten.

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:35.545
Together...

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:36.913
we're a Bunch.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.848
KIDS:
Yeah. The Brady Bunch.

01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:40.450
What do you say,
Greg?

01:13:40.484 --> 01:13:41.685
Please?

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:47.991
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:49.192
Grab some costumes.

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:51.194
We've got to make that contest!

01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:53.830
Okay!
All right!

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:01.838
* We are blood

01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:03.507
* We don't vote

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.975
* We are standing all alone

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:07.744
* At the beginning

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.178
* Of the end

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:11.014
* We are phlegm

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:14.551
* We are phlegm.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:15.919
I'm so nervous.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.153
Why am I so nervous?

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.889
Stop it.
You're making me nervous.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:22.992
( spitoon clanks )

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:25.929
All right, let's have
a big hand for Phlegm.

01:14:28.732 --> 01:14:31.034
Yay!

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:34.504
You sounded hot.

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:37.040
What, are you--
completely brain-dead?

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:38.942
Leon missed
an entire riff.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.510
Didn't you hear it?

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:42.145
I liked it.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:45.048
You're such a loser.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:50.954
Hey, Eric.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.288
I'm sick and tired

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.658
of seeing you treat
Holly that way.

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:55.959
In fact...

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.961
I'm sick and tired
of you altogether.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.565
You're nothing but a...

01:15:01.598 --> 01:15:03.099
a big bully.

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:05.802
( chuckling )

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.537
You're dog meat, Brady.

01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:11.741
( voice breaking ):
Do it... and die, Eric.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.047
( falsetto ):
Ohh!

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:18.948
Ohh!

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:20.183
Oh.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.053
JAN:
Hurry, Peter.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:25.188
We're on.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:27.557
Thanks, Peter.

01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:30.126
I think you're
really... neato.

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:35.131
M.C.:
Oh, yes.
I hope everybody's having

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:36.265
a good time.

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:40.336
( deep voice: )
Why, uh... thank you, Holly.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:44.708
I think you're... Ginger
and Mary Ann combined.

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:47.744
Come on, Peter.
That's us.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:48.678
See ya.

01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:49.913
Good luck.

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:52.548
( Eric moaning )

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:56.185
( guitar solo playing )

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:03.192
* Flying down the highway
in our makeshift Model T.A. *

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:03.960
* Ooh

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:04.961
* Yeah

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:06.062
* Ooh

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:07.731
* It's a beautiful morning

01:16:07.764 --> 01:16:12.268
* And it's gonna be
a beautiful day *

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.271
* The wheels are humming
and the guitar's strumming *

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.241
* And the radio is blasting
and good times are coming *

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.109
* As we're flying down
the highway *

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:22.145
* In our makeshift Model T.A.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:27.150
* We're gonna keep on,
keep on, keep on *

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:30.887
* Keep on dancing
all through the night *

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:36.626
* We're gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on doing it right *

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:39.796
* We're gonna keep on,
keep on, keep on moving *

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:43.266
* Gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on grooving *

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:47.270
* Keep on singing and dancing
all through the night *

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:51.307
( singing as Elvis ):
* You can hear the music

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.076
* More than 26 miles away

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.678
* Ooh, yeah

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:55.679
* Ooh

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:57.146
* Your smile is heaven

01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:00.083
* And heaven is here to stay

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.284
* Yeah

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:03.252
* We're gonna keep on, keep on

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:07.824
* Keep on, keep on dancing
all through the night *

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:14.030
* We're gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on doing it right *

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:16.833
* We're gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on moving *

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:20.203
* Gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on grooving *

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:21.871
* Keep on singing

01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:25.141
* And dancing
all through the night *

01:17:31.915 --> 01:17:34.283
* We're gonna keep on, keep on

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:38.321
* Keep on, keep on dancing
all through the night *

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:44.060
* We're gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on doing it right *

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:48.431
* We're gonna keep on, keep on,
keep on moving *

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:51.200
* Gonna keep on, keep on...

01:17:51.234 --> 01:17:53.202
( both squealing )

01:17:58.241 --> 01:17:59.976
Thank you, Brady Bunch.

01:18:01.277 --> 01:18:02.712
You were great.

01:18:02.746 --> 01:18:04.748
Great.

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:07.050
Give the rest
of our contestants a big hand

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:08.151
as our judges

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:10.153
tally up the scores.

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:15.158
Thank you.

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:17.827
And I have it right here.

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:19.428
The winner
of the Search

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:22.198
for the Stars
$20,000 grand prize is...

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:25.835
the Brady Bunch?

01:18:25.869 --> 01:18:28.037
( cheering )

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:31.841
( scattered applause )

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:33.442
Hey, great job.
Thanks.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.081
They what?!

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:40.416
How could those losers
win anything?

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.752
Look, Eric,
you got to stall them for me.

01:18:42.786 --> 01:18:44.921
What do you mean,
what's in it for you?

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.756
All right,
you have my permission

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:48.424
to pierce anything you want.

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.426
Just keep them
from getting here.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.861
Damn kid.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:02.405
Come on.

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:06.409
Well, here it is.

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:08.444
A check made out
to the Brady Bunch

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:11.180
for $20,000.

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:12.248
Come on, gang, let's go.
Hurry!

01:19:12.281 --> 01:19:13.282
All right, everybody.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:14.283
Let's hear it
for them Bradys.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:15.284
They were something else.

01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:16.485
Thanks for coming down.

01:19:16.519 --> 01:19:18.321
I hope you had a good time
and we'll see you...

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:20.289
Come on, come on.

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:21.124
Let's go, troops!

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:22.391
Come on! Hurry up!

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:25.795
( girls clamoring )

01:19:25.829 --> 01:19:27.463
Hey, there,
groovy chicks.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:30.466
You're all happening
in far out ways.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.135
Greg, hurry.
The house.

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:42.846
Now, how do you suppose
that happened?

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:45.314
Oh, Mike.
What are we going to do?

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:46.249
( car alarm blaring )

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:48.885
Hey, Marcia, look.
It's our friend, Eddie.

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:50.153
You remember.

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:51.587
The guy who needed
a car jack.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.857
Come on, everybody.
He can give us a lift.

01:19:59.362 --> 01:20:00.496
GREG:
Hey, Eddie!

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.365
Oh, no.

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:04.333
Can you give us a ride?

01:20:04.367 --> 01:20:05.601
A ride?

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:08.204
Good afternoon.

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:09.205
Having trouble

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:10.606
with the car alarm?

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:11.908
No. It's not our car.

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.309
It's our friend Eddie's.

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.511
Oh, really?

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.246
Where are the keys, Eddie?

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.481
I lost them.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:20.149
Oh, no.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:22.618
But we were counting on you
to give us a ride to our house.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.087
I'll run the plate.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.388
BOBBY:
Uh, excuse me,
Officer

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:28.324
but I'd hate to ask
a law enforcement official

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:30.193
to bend the rules...

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:32.228
especially for
penal code 117

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:34.097
section 33-B,

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:35.298
but our house is at stake.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:38.134
( clamoring )

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:42.305
Please?

01:20:44.407 --> 01:20:46.175
2:00. Auction time.

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:48.311
It's exciting,
isn't it, Alice?

01:20:49.913 --> 01:20:51.580
By the power
authorized me

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.182
by the county of Los Angeles,

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:56.185
I hereby offer this property
to the highest bidder,

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:57.420
unless the owner redeems...

01:20:57.453 --> 01:20:58.988
Come on, come on, come on.

01:20:59.022 --> 01:21:00.089
Okay, I'll start

01:21:00.123 --> 01:21:03.526
the bidding at the sum total
of back taxes: $20,000.

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:05.194
Do I have any takers?

01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:08.397
Say... I've got $20,000.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:09.933
( sirens blaring )

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:11.134
MIKE:
Stop the auction!

01:21:13.402 --> 01:21:15.571
We have the money
for the tax bill.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.108
I repeat,

01:21:19.142 --> 01:21:20.643
stop the auction.

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:22.912
We have the money
for the tax bill.

01:21:22.946 --> 01:21:25.214
The house is still ours.

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:26.515
Come on, kids.

01:21:30.453 --> 01:21:32.055
Hold everything.

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:35.925
Good news, everybody.

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:38.962
The Bradys are here to stay.

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.263
You lied to us,
Dittmeyer.

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:41.497
The Bradys
aren't selling.

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:42.498
I knew it!

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:43.499
You guaranteed us!

01:21:43.532 --> 01:21:45.101
You ruined us,
Dittmeyer.

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:46.135
You're going to pay
for this.

01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:47.503
MIKE:
Now, hold on, people.

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:48.938
Wait a minute.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.075
The man you should
be angry with

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:55.378
is me, 'cause our house
is more important than money.

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.981
This neighborhood
is more important
than money.

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.182
Tell me, how many times

01:21:59.215 --> 01:22:01.117
have we borrowed
each other's power tools

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:02.952
or patched up
each other's kids?

01:22:02.986 --> 01:22:05.254
We know so much
about each other.

01:22:05.288 --> 01:22:08.091
I know that every January,
Mr. Yeager's going to have

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:10.226
that big Super Bowl party
at his house.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.260
Yeah.

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:13.296
We know every spring
Mrs. Simmons

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:15.598
is going to have the prettiest
daffodils on the block.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:17.600
They are beautiful.
They are lovely flowers.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:20.036
We know that at 10:15
every Saturday morning,

01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:21.404
Mrs. Topping likes to walk

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:23.239
through her
living room naked.

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:24.273
( laughing )

01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:25.508
You knew about that?

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:27.043
Call me
old-fashioned,

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:29.045
but these things
are important

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:30.980
and they're not for sale.

01:22:31.014 --> 01:22:33.149
This is our neighborhood...

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:34.450
and we're staying.

01:22:36.019 --> 01:22:38.454
Now, this is going
to sound crazy...

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.323
but Brady's right.

01:22:40.356 --> 01:22:41.991
We're never
going to find

01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:43.459
another neighborhood
like this.

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:46.395
And we'll never find neighbors
like the Bradys.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:49.999
We're staying, too.

01:22:50.033 --> 01:22:51.334
Us, too.

01:22:51.367 --> 01:22:52.635
BOTH:
So are we.

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.070
We will, too.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:56.039
Great.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:57.206
Gosh, I wish I lived here.

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:01.010
I mean, it's...
it's incredible.

01:23:01.044 --> 01:23:03.646
You people are
all staying...

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:08.484
because one family
is willing to stand up

01:23:08.517 --> 01:23:10.253
for what they believe in?

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:12.488
Well... that and
the huge settlement

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:16.192
we're going to get after
we sue Dittmeyer's ass.

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:17.493
Oh, Mike.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:20.029
I always knew
you could hit a grand slam

01:23:20.063 --> 01:23:22.498
and now we can stay
in our house after all.

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:25.668
Hey, do you know who'd
love to hear about this?

01:23:27.303 --> 01:23:28.504
KIDS:
Grandma!

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:29.572
Hey.

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.507
( clamoring )

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:34.677
Hi, everybody.

01:23:36.412 --> 01:23:40.683
Wait a minute.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.219
Look, how pretty
you have gotten.

01:23:43.252 --> 01:23:45.188
Oh, those clothes.

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.622
Oh, what taste.

01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:48.624
And that smile...

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:53.529
Oh, Marcia,
you are such a beauty.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:55.698
Everyone loves Marcia.

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:56.832
No one loves you.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:24:00.069
( raspy voice ):
Watch my head spin.

01:24:00.103 --> 01:24:02.538
Kill, kill, kill!

01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:04.073
No, stop it!

01:24:04.107 --> 01:24:05.374
I can't take it anymore!

01:24:05.408 --> 01:24:06.542
( voice laughing )

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.344
Aw, shut up, you loser!

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.378
Jan!

01:24:09.412 --> 01:24:10.379
Cut the crap.

01:24:10.413 --> 01:24:11.714
( voice laughing )

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:13.416
( laughing stops )

01:24:13.449 --> 01:24:14.550
They're gone.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.319
Thank you, Grandma.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:18.387
Oh, there.

01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:20.723
Cindy.

01:24:20.756 --> 01:24:22.558
Oh, Cindy.

01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:25.161
Why does Jan get
all the attention?

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:29.565
Yeah. It's always
Jan, Jan, Jan.

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.835
( electric guitar
playing theme song )

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:00.823
* The Brady Bunch

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.925
* The Brady Bunch

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:08.931
* That's the way we became
the Brady Bunch. *

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.551
* I remember someone said

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:32.288
* Even when we lose,
we win *

01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:35.924
* Well, we must
be winning now *

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:39.662
* Cause it's got
that losing feeling *
* Mom always said

01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:43.399
* Don't throw the ball
in the house *

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:46.902
* I only wish that I had known

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:50.739
* Maybe I would
not have broken *

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:54.477
* Every single thing I own

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:58.481
* Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate *

01:26:58.514 --> 01:27:01.917
* Down to your DNA

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:05.788
* Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate *

01:27:05.821 --> 01:27:07.956
* And get out of our way

01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:09.725
* Have a nice day

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:20.369
* You know your father
is right *

01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:23.972
* And he's always going to be

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:27.810
* Well, that makes me
feel so great *

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:31.547
* Cause I just
love being angry *

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.418
* Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate *

01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:37.720
* Down to your DNA

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:42.791
* Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate *

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:44.627
* And get out of our way

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.429
* Have a nice day

01:27:46.462 --> 01:27:48.764
