AND LEFT FOR DEAD

00:42.710 --> 00:44.678
BY A GANG
OF GAY BASHERS.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.114
- IT'S KIND OF GORY.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.215
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.582
- I'M SURE
THAT I LEFT IT HERE.

00:48.616 --> 00:49.550
- HERE'S RAGE

00:49.583 --> 00:52.320
ZAPPING THE BASHERS
WITH HIS MIND DISTORTER.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.621
- WITH HIS WHAT?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.689
- HE SURROUNDS THEM
WITH A MIND DISTORTION FIELD

00:55.723 --> 00:57.325
SO THEY THINK
THEY'RE ALL FAGS.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.193
- THEN THEY
BEAT EACH OTHER TO DEATH.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.562
- WOW.
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

01:01.595 --> 01:04.098
- THEN HE SWOOPS J.T.
INTO HIS ARMS

01:04.132 --> 01:05.799
AND TAKES HIM
UP TO HIS LAIR

01:05.833 --> 01:07.568
PERCHED HIGH ABOVE

01:07.601 --> 01:09.403

01:09.437 --> 01:11.639
WITH LOTS OF HEAVY KISSING
AND DEEP ANAL PENETRATION.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.141

01:23.884 --> 01:25.319
WHILE YOU WERE DROPPING OUT

ISN'T THAT THE MOST AMAZING
COINCIDENCE?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.912
- WHAT, THAT YOU TWO

- OR THAT YOU AND BRIAN
ARE BOTH IN LOVE

01:53.681 --> 01:56.150
WITH GUYS
WHO HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.452

THE MOST AMAZING COINCIDENCE?

02:36.524 --> 02:38.659
- THAT YOU BEN AND, LIKE,
17 MILLION OTHER PEOPLE

02:38.692 --> 02:41.262
HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY?

02:41.295 --> 02:42.930
- SO HOW DO YOU PLAN ON
COMMEMORATING THE BIG EVENT?

02:42.963 --> 02:45.266
A TRIP TO KEY WEST?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.601
SOMETHING WITH FOUR WHEELS
AND A RETRACTABLE HARD-TOP?

02:47.635 --> 02:48.702
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.870
- I'M NOT.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.672
- YOU'RE NOT?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.541
- WHAT'S A FUCKING BIRTHDAY?

02:53.574 --> 02:55.976
ANYBODY CAN GET BORN,
EVEN YOU.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.547
THE ONLY THING WORTH
CELEBRATING IS ACHIEVEMENT.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.914
- I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU

03:00.948 --> 03:03.851
THROWING MICHAEL A LITTLE
SURPRISE PARTY LAST YEAR.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.353
- I AGREE WITH BRIAN.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.321
I THINK BIRTHDAYS
ARE SILLY,

03:07.355 --> 03:09.890
SENTIMENTAL,
AND UNNECESSARY.

03:09.923 --> 03:10.991
- OKAY, SWEETHEART,

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
THANKS FOR THE RIDE,
BUT, UH,

03:12.660 --> 03:15.429
HERE'S WHERE I GET OFF.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.400
- SOME CATCH. HOW COME
YOU'RE THROWING HIM BACK?

03:19.433 --> 03:20.668
- NOT BIG ENOUGH?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.903
- OH, I'M SURE
HE'S BIG ENOUGH.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.372
- YOU STILL IN MOURNING?

03:24.405 --> 03:26.006
- I'VE TRIED BOYS,
I'VE TRIED BOOZE,

03:26.039 --> 03:27.641
I'VE TRIED PILLS...

03:27.675 --> 03:31.879
BUT I AM STILL IN THE VALLEY
OF THE DULLS.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.849
- WELL, NEELY, MAYBE YOU NEED
SOME SPIRITUAL SUCCOR.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.551
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD CALL
MY MOTHER'S MINISTER.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.487
HE GIVES GREAT HEAD.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.689
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF
HEALING I HAD IN MIND.

03:41.722 --> 03:45.459
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME
TOMORROW...

03:45.493 --> 03:47.495
TO CHURCH.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.962
- CHURCH?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.464
- THE CURTAIN
HAS ALREADY GONE UP

03:50.498 --> 03:52.466
ON THE BIGGEST SHOW
IN TOWN,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.968
IN THE UNIVERSE,
IN CREATION.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.871
IT'S CALLED "YOUR LIFE"!

03:57.905 --> 03:59.340
AND IT STARS YOU.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.375
THE ORIGINAL CAST,
WITH LYRICS AND MUSIC,

04:01.409 --> 04:03.877
AND A BOOK THAT COULD ONLY
HAVE BEEN WRITTEN,

04:03.911 --> 04:08.316
DIRECTED,
AND CONCEIVED BY...

04:08.349 --> 04:09.350
GOD!

04:09.383 --> 04:10.618
all: AMEN.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.321
- ISN'T REVEREND BRAD
INCREDIBLE?

04:13.354 --> 04:16.457
- YEAH, YEAH, HE SHOULD...
WIN A TONY.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.626
- THIS IS NOT
A DRESS REHEARSAL, KIDS.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.961
LET US SELL IT
TO THE BALCONY AND BEYOND.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.830

04:36.377 --> 04:38.078
- IMAGINE
HOW GOOD YOU'LL FEEL.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.747

A LITTLE MORE THAN A SHOW TUNE.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.617
- * LIKE A DREAM, YOUR SPIRIT
SEEMS TO TURN ABOUT *

04:43.651 --> 04:46.420

- COME ON, BARNABY,
LET'S GO TO PITTSBURGH.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.415
- I WAS WITH THE PEACE CORPS
FOR A FEW YEARS,

05:14.448 --> 05:16.049
BUT THEN, I DECIDED
WHAT I REALLY WANTED

05:16.083 --> 05:18.952
WAS TO WORK WITH KIDS.
- THAT'S SWEET.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.054
- HUH.
EVER TEACH SECOND-GRADERS?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.691
SWEET'S NOT EXACTLY THE WORD.
- [chuckling]

05:23.724 --> 05:25.859
I'M SURE THEY ADORE YOU.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.127
- I LOVE IT.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.796
AND IT ALLOWS ME TIME
IN THE EVENINGS

05:28.829 --> 05:30.698
TO VOLUNTEER AT THE GAY YOUTH
SUPPORT LINE

05:30.731 --> 05:33.100
AND TO TRAIN FOR THE AIDS RIDE
ON THE WEEKEND.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.470
AND THEN, OF COURSE, I, UH...
HELP OUT AT THE CHURCH.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.672
- OF COURSE. HEH.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.907
I'M IMPRESSED.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.943

ABOUT MYSELF.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.679
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- I RUN MY OWN DOT-COM
COMPANY.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.113
- REALLY?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.849
AN ENTREPRENEUR.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.585
SO, UH, WHAT KIND OF
COMPANY IS IT?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.787
- YOU KNOW...

06:26.820 --> 06:28.889
DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S NEEDS.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.427
YOU MIGHT CALL IT...

06:33.461 --> 06:35.028
RELIEF WORK.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.530
- SOMEHOW I...

06:36.564 --> 06:37.665
I KNEW YOU'D DO SOMETHING

06:37.698 --> 06:41.502
THAT INVOLVED
HELPING OTHERS.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.037
- A SURPRISE PARTY?

SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.040
- DO?
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,

06:47.074 --> 06:48.108
AFTER EVERYONE
JUMPS OUT OF THE WOODWORK

06:48.141 --> 06:49.309
AND SCREAMS "SURPRISE"?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.779
- I DON'T KNOW. I-I THOUGHT
WE'D SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY

06:51.812 --> 06:53.881
AND CUT THE CAKE,
OPEN PRESENTS.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.583
- ANY THOUGHT OF NUDITY
AND DRUGS?

06:55.616 --> 06:57.785
- THIS ISN'T
ONE OF YOUR AFFAIRS.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.653
BESIDES,
I'M NOT ROLLING IN DOUGH.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.522
I CAN'T AFFORD
SOME ELABORATE PARTY.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.023
- SWEETHEART, YOU DON'T NEED
A LOT OF MONEY,

07:03.056 --> 07:04.925
YOU JUST NEED A THEME.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.059
WHAT'S, UH,
WHAT'S BEN INTO?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.995
- YOGA, BUDDHISM.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.163
- OH, WE CAN MEDITATE!

07:10.197 --> 07:11.632
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.766
- OKAY, GIVE ME A MINUTE HERE.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.002
LET ME THINK,
LET ME THINK.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.672
OKAY, OKAY, IT'S COMING TO ME.
I'M GETTING AN IDEA.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.940
WHY DON'T WE DO

07:19.973 --> 07:22.676
A GEISHA-SUSHI-"MISS-SAIGONY"
KIND OF THING?

07:22.710 --> 07:24.111
WE CAN TRANSFORM
BEN'S APARTMENT

07:24.144 --> 07:26.980
INTO A FAR EASTERN
PHANTASMAGORIA

07:27.014 --> 07:28.215
WITH COLORED LANTERNS

07:28.248 --> 07:31.218
AND, UM, LITTLE...
PAGODAS.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.120
- YEAH.
BETTER YET,

07:33.153 --> 07:34.688
WHY DON'T YOU BUY
A BOTTLE OF SAKE

07:34.722 --> 07:36.256
AND A COPY OF THE KAMA SUTRA

07:36.289 --> 07:38.826
AND FUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.027
IT'LL BE CHEAPER.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.729
- HONEY, YOU JUST
LEAVE IT TO ME.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.565
I WILL MAKE SURE IT IS A PARTY
THAT'S UNFORGETTABLE.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.199
- WHO'S HAVING A PARTY?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.235
- NOBODY.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.505
- MUSTN'T BE MUCH
OF A GUEST LIST.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.106
- BEN'S BIRTHDAY.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.142
AND MICHAEL'S GOING TO
THROW HIM A FAR EASTERN...

07:55.175 --> 07:59.580

[bell dings]

08:04.184 --> 08:06.153
- HEY, DEB,
YOUR ORDER'S UP.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.955

GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.860
- WHAT THE FUCK
YOU TELL HER FOR?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.895
- WHY THE FUCK DO YOU WANT
TO KEEP IT A SECRET?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.097
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO
GIVE ME ANY MORE SHIT ABOUT BEN.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.700
- MAYBE IF YOU INVITED HER...

08:19.733 --> 08:22.770
- WHAT FOR?
SHE WOULDN'T COME ANYWAY.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.805
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.907
- BRIAN DOESN'T BELIEVE IN
BIRTHDAYS, NOT EVEN HIS OWN.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.776
- WHAT KIND OF
BULLSHIT IS THAT?

08:28.809 --> 08:30.644
- HE ALMOST KILLED HIMSELF
WHEN HE TURNED 30.

08:30.678 --> 08:31.979
- YEAH, WHO'S TALKING
ABOUT HIS BIRTHDAY?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.146
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT JUSTIN'S.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.915
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM
WITH TURNING 19?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.850
- HE BELIEVES IN CELEBRATING
ACCOMPLISHMENT,

08:36.884 --> 08:37.885
NOT SENTIMENTAL RITUALS.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.019
- OH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.988
WHAT THE HELL DID HE DO,
BRAINWASH YOU?

08:41.021 --> 08:44.024
EVERYBODY DESERVES A LITTLE
ATTENTION ON THEIR BIRTHDAY.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.193
- ESPECIALLY FROM THE PERSON
THEY LOVE.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.695
[giggling]

08:47.728 --> 08:50.030
WELL, IF BRIAN'S NOT GOING
TO DO ANYTHING, WE WILL.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.966
- YEAH. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE, UH,
GO TO DINNER AND A MOVIE?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.202
- OH, THAT'S NOT VERY SPECIAL.
WE CAN DO THAT ANYTIME.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.137
- OKAY,
LET'S THROW A PARTY.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.840
- I HATE PARTIES.
- HE HATES PARTIES.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.709
- BESIDES, MICHAEL'S
ALREADY GIVING BEN ONE.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.645
- I KNOW. YOU'RE COMING WITH US,
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.046
- WHERE?

09:06.079 --> 09:07.615
- A FRIEND OF MINE WHO TEACHES
IN THE MUSIC DEPARTMENT

09:07.648 --> 09:11.084
AT YOUR SCHOOL INVITED US
TO A VIOLIN RECITAL.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.686
- A VIOLIN RECITAL?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.955
- SHE SAID THE STUDENT
WHO'S PLAYING IS A GENIUS.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.790
- I'M NOT REALLY
INTO CLASSICAL MUSIC.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.291
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU EXPOSED YOURSELF

09:18.325 --> 09:20.227
TO A HIGHER FORM
OF CULTURAL EXPRESSION

09:20.260 --> 09:22.663
THAN THE THUMPA-THUMPA
AT BABYLON.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.698
- WELL, IF HE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO, DON'T FORCE HIM.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.334
ALTHOUGH SHE ALSO SAID
HE'S REALLY CUTE.

09:27.367 --> 09:31.271
[giggling]

09:31.304 --> 09:32.873
- [mouth full]
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

09:32.906 --> 09:36.243
[indistinct chatter]

09:36.276 --> 09:39.079
- AHH.
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.714
- BUT IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.316
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
IT'S BETTER TO GIVE.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.619
- WELL, RECEIVING'S
NOT TOO BAD EITHER.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.787
- MMM.
- YOU KNOW, WHILE WE'RE

09:46.820 --> 09:48.155
ON THE SUBJECT
OF YOUR BIRTHDAY...

09:48.188 --> 09:49.957
- YES, WHILE WE'RE ON IT,
PLEASE, NOTHING SPECIAL.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.293
LET'S JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE
AND LOW-KEY, OKAY?

09:53.326 --> 09:54.094
- SIMPLE AND LOW-KEY IT IS.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.729
I THOUGHT WE COULD
GO TO DINNER.

09:55.763 --> 09:59.366
- SOMEPLACE EASY AND CASUAL,
NOTHING FANCY.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.769
- HOW ABOUT
THE LIBERTY DINER?

10:01.802 --> 10:02.736
- NOT THAT CASUAL.
[chuckles]

10:02.770 --> 10:04.772
- LOOK, HOW ABOUT I MEET YOU
AT YOUR PLACE?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.039
UM, WHAT TIME
DO YOU GET HOME?

10:06.073 --> 10:10.010
- AH, IF I HAD MY DAMN PALM, I
COULD TELL YOU FOR SURE, BUT...

10:10.043 --> 10:11.979
LET'S SEE, I'VE GOT CLASSES
TILL 4:00,

10:12.012 --> 10:14.381
THEN THE DOCTOR'S,
THEN YOGA, SO...

10:14.414 --> 10:17.651
I'D SAY AROUND 7:00.
UM, NO, YOU BETTER MAKE IT 7:30.

10:17.685 --> 10:18.786
- PERFECT.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.320
- BEN.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.923
- HEY, PAUL.
[grunts]

10:22.956 --> 10:24.124
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, BABY?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.258
- MM, GOOD.
GOOD. YOU?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.860
- AH, NO COMPLAINTS.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.928
- PAUL, THIS IS MICHAEL.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.130
- OH, MICHAEL.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.732
I HEARD YOU WERE SEEING
SOMEONE.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.133
- WORD TRAVELS FAST.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.135
- [laughs]
AROUND HERE?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.304
UH, LISTEN, UH,
WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.706
WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME
SOMETIME?

10:38.739 --> 10:41.008
- I WILL, I'LL DO THAT.
- GOOD.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.110
SEE YOU, MICHAEL.
both: SEE YOU.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.378
- NICE GUY.
- PAUL? OH, YEAH, HE'S...

10:45.412 --> 10:46.513
HE'S A SWEETHEART.

10:46.546 --> 10:50.017
ACTUALLY, HE AND I WERE
TOGETHER ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.151
- OH.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.887
- NO, WE STAYED FRIENDS,
AL--

10:53.921 --> 10:56.323
ALTHOUGH AT THE TIME,
IT WAS NOT EASY.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.825
- WAIT, ISN'T THAT
ABOUT THE TIME

10:57.858 --> 10:58.859
THAT YOU FOUND OUT
THAT YOU WERE...

10:58.892 --> 10:59.860
- POSITIVE, YEAH.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.061
HE'S THE ONE
WHO INFECTED ME.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.796
- HOLY FUCK.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.732
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S...

11:04.765 --> 11:06.166
IT'S OKAY.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.436
HE DIDN'T KNOW AND I-I
SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE CAREFUL.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.939
ANYWAY, I'VE, UH...

11:11.972 --> 11:13.907
I'VE FORGIVEN HIM.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.781
- THE MAN IS PERFECT.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.915
THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.251
HOW ELSE COULD YOU FORGIVE
THE GUY WHO INFECTED YOU?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.119
- [snorts]
TRY NUTS.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.321
- IF IT WERE ME,
I'D WANT TO KILL HIM.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.990
- BEN'S NOT LIKE THAT.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.292
HE'S MANAGED TO FREE HIMSELF
FROM ALL THE EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE

11:32.325 --> 11:33.861
THAT THE REST OF US
CARRY AROUND.

11:33.894 --> 11:34.828
- I WONDER HOW HE DOES IT.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.330
- MY GUESS,
HE SINGS A LOT OF SHOW TUNES.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.899
- YOU WEREN'T DOING
SUCH A BAD JOB,

11:38.932 --> 11:41.134
BELTING THEM OUT.
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.203
YOUR DUET
WITH THE BOY INGENUE?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.072
- AH, YOU MEAN SAINT LUKE?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.940
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOUR INTEREST IN HIM

11:46.974 --> 11:48.375
ISN'T ENTIRELY SPIRITUAL.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.111
- HE IS THE SWEETEST,
THE KINDEST, THE...

11:51.144 --> 11:53.380
SEXIEST, MOST ADORABLE GUY
I'VE EVER MET.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.948
- SO WHAT DOES HE THINK
ABOUT YOU?

11:54.982 --> 11:57.050
- HE THINKS I RUN
A RELIEF ORGANIZATION.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.318
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.319
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.353
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

12:00.387 --> 12:01.889
- YEP.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.091
ME, THE RED CROSS,
AND THE UNICEF.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.994
- AND HOW, PRAY, DID HE GET
THAT IMPRESSION?

12:07.027 --> 12:10.230
- WELL, HE ASKED ME
WHAT I DID, AND I, UH--

12:10.263 --> 12:12.199
- LIED?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.935
- WHY THE HELL DID YOU
DO THAT?

12:14.968 --> 12:16.970
- HE'S A CHURCH-GOING
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER

12:17.004 --> 12:18.505
WHO DOES CHARITY WORK,
FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.373
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD HE THINK
IF I TOLD HIM I'M THE CEO

12:20.407 --> 12:22.309
OF JERKATWORK.NET?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.144
- WELL, IF HE'S AS PERFECT
AS YOU SAY,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.346
HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T CARE.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.548
- [groans]
WELL, BOYS...

12:28.581 --> 12:30.083
YOU DATE YOUR SAINTS.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.152
I'LL STICK TO THE SINNERS.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.825
- BUT IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.793
- COULDN'T YOU AT LEAST
HAVE A CAKE?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.129
- I DON'T NEED ANY CAKE.
I GAINED THREE OUNCES LAST WEEK.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.964
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE
GET OFF MY BACK?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.166
I HAVE A SHITLOAD
OF WORK TO DO.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.135
- HEY, YOU LOOK SPIFFY.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.402
- A NEW SPORT COAT?

12:49.436 --> 12:52.072
- YEP. MY MOM GOT IT FOR ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

12:52.105 --> 12:56.276
- DIDN'T YOUR DADDY EVER
TEACH YOU HOW TO TIE A TIE?

12:56.309 --> 12:57.878
- NO, HE WAS TOO BUSY
KICKING ME OUT

12:57.911 --> 12:59.512
AND BEATING THE SHIT
OUT OF YOU.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.281
- WELL, NEITHER DID MINE.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.516
HE WAS TOO BUSY
REGRETTING THE DAY I WAS BORN.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.517
COME HERE.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.486
- * ALL RIGHT

13:06.519 --> 13:08.889
* YOU'RE GETTING
WAY TOO CLOSE *

13:08.922 --> 13:10.924
* ALL RIGHT

13:10.958 --> 13:13.093
* SMELLIN' LIKE A ROSE

13:13.126 --> 13:14.895
* COME ON

13:14.928 --> 13:17.430
- THIS ISN'T THE BIRTHDAY SUIT
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU IN.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.566
[chuckles]

13:19.599 --> 13:21.468
- * AND FIND A BETTER WAY

13:21.501 --> 13:22.836
- THERE, NOW.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.437
GO GET SOME CULTURE.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.240
*

13:27.274 --> 13:30.243
- DON'T WORK TOO HARD.

13:30.277 --> 13:35.949
*

13:35.983 --> 13:38.485
- I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.586
*

13:39.619 --> 13:42.222
- * WHAT HAVE WE GOT,
YOU AND ME *

13:42.255 --> 13:43.423
- DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.325
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.894
- FEW DO.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.361
- IT'S OBVIOUS HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE HIM,

13:48.395 --> 13:50.197
YET YOU WON'T CELEBRATE
HIS BIRTHDAY

13:50.230 --> 13:52.232
BECAUSE YOU DON'T CONSIDER
IT AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.201
WELL, ISN'T IT AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT HE'S ALIVE

13:54.234 --> 13:55.335
AND WELL?

13:55.368 --> 13:57.070
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH REASON
TO CELEBRATE?

13:57.104 --> 14:00.307
- * MAKE MY DAY
WHEN YOU MAKE MY NIGHT *

14:00.340 --> 14:04.945
* MAKE MY DAY
STEPPING INTO THE LIGHT *

14:04.978 --> 14:09.049
* MAKE MY DAY
WHEN YOU MAKE MY NIGHT *

14:09.082 --> 14:11.084
* ALL RIGHT
[door slams]

14:11.118 --> 14:13.186
* YOU'RE GETTING
WAY TOO CLOSE *

14:13.220 --> 14:16.189
[intense violin music]

14:16.223 --> 14:24.164
*

15:41.774 --> 15:43.643
- I FOUND IT.

15:43.676 --> 15:47.414
I WORE IT TO THE WHAT-A-DRAG
BALL IN '89.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.382
I WENT AS CHO-CHO-SAN.
- [laughs]

15:49.416 --> 15:51.651
- YOUR MOTHER WENT
AS PINKERTON.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.586
I PROMISED EMMETT HE COULD
BORROW IT FOR THE PARTY.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.156
- IT WILL MAKE
A FABULOUS HOSTESS GOWN.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.491
- HE'LL BE STUNNING.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.493
- JUST DON'T BE LATE.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.229
- AND DON'T YOU BE NERVOUS.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.730
- I JUST WANT EVERYTHING
TO COME OFF AS PLANNED,

16:03.763 --> 16:05.132
YOU KNOW, FOR BEN.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.734
- IT'LL BE THE SOCIAL EVENT
OF THE SEASON.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.336
- WHAT'S THE SOCIAL EVENT
OF THE SEASON?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.704
THE HOMO HOP AT BABYLON?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.474
- BEN'S SURPRISE PARTY.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.209
- OH.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.344
- [clears throat]

16:17.377 --> 16:19.712
I WAS JUST TELLING VIC
NOT TO BE LATE.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.749
- UH-HUH.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.617
- YOU KNOW...

16:24.651 --> 16:26.686
IF YOU WANT TO COME...

16:26.719 --> 16:29.222
- AH, THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT PLANS. I'M--

16:29.256 --> 16:33.226
I'M, UH, I-I'M GOING
TO THE MOVIES WITH MY--MY--

16:33.260 --> 16:35.595
MY FRIEND ROSIE.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.097
B-BUT PLEASE,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.399
WISH HIM MANY HAPPY RETURNS
FOR ME.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.672
- I WILL.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.307
AND I'LL BE SURE TO GIVE THIS
TO EMMETT.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.409
THANKS.
- SEE YOU, MICHAEL.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.755
YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ROSIE
IN...12 YEARS?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.457
- WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW,
SHE MAY CALL.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.226
HERE, HELP ME WITH THIS.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.201
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT

17:14.234 --> 17:15.768
WHERE MICHAEL AND BEN
ARE CONCERNED.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.637
- DO YOU SEE ME GIVING HIM
ANY GRIEF?

17:17.670 --> 17:20.240
- I DON'T SEE YOU GIVING HIM
ANY JOY.

17:20.273 --> 17:24.811
- I AGREED TO TOLERATE IT,
NOT ENDORSE IT.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.314
- WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
UP YOUR COMMITMENT A NOTCH.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.748
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT,

17:28.781 --> 17:30.683
BEN'S BEEN
A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON HIM.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.386
- POSITIVE?
EXACTLY.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.821
- AND DESPITE
ALL OF YOUR DARKEST FEARS

17:34.854 --> 17:36.289
AND DIRE PREDICTIONS,

17:36.323 --> 17:40.160
THEY BOTH SEEM TO BE
DOING JUST FINE.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.762
SO WHY NOT BE A SPORT...

17:42.795 --> 17:44.731
AND MAKE THE KID HAPPY?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.471
- WAS HE AMAZING OR WHAT?

17:51.504 --> 17:54.207
- AND TO THINK
THAT HE'S SO YOUNG.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.409
- HE STARTED PLAYING
WHEN HE WAS FOUR.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.445
HE STUDIED WITH THE GREAT
ANDREI VISHNEVSKI.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.380
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT CLASSICAL MUSIC.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.182
- I READ THE PROGRAM.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.717
- I THINK WE'RE WITNESSING
A CONVERSION EXPERIENCE.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.554
- ANOTHER LESBIAN
SUCCESS STORY. HMM.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.456
- YES.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.591
OH, THERE'S SUSAN. I'D BETTER
THANK HER FOR THE TICKETS.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.625
OH, EXCUSE ME.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.729
[indistinct chatter]

18:18.698 --> 18:20.300
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.276
- I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GREAT.

18:29.309 --> 18:33.246
- THE RAVEL WAS PASSABLE,
BUT THE BRAHMS WAS FOR SHIT.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.614
- I DIDN'T NOTICE.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.417
- YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE.
IT WAS ALL YOUR FAULT.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.619
- ME?
- YES.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.656
THE WAY YOU WERE STARING
AT ME WAS VERY DISTRACTING.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.392
- I'M SORRY.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.461

IN A BAD WAY.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.597

19:04.411 --> 19:07.414
IT'S ME IN FIVE VARIATIONS.
- [chuckles]

19:07.447 --> 19:09.782
IT'S A HABIT.
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.384
STOP MYSELF.
[chuckles]

19:11.418 --> 19:13.186

OF A TRUE ARTIST.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.555
I PLAY IN MY SLEEP.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.490
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU GUYS

YOU'RE SO NICE,
SO SINCERE...

20:38.371 --> 20:41.941
SO HONEST.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.444
I FELT IMMEDIATELY

20:44.477 --> 20:47.013
THAT YOU'RE SOMEONE
I COULD TRUST.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.581

20:48.615 --> 20:50.417
[stammering]

20:50.450 --> 20:52.719
YOU REMEMBER, UH,
WHEN YOU ASKED ME WHAT I DID,

20:52.752 --> 20:55.021
AND THEN--
AND I SAID I...

20:55.054 --> 20:56.889
I WORKED IN COMPUTERS?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.292
- MM-HMM, AND THAT YOU'RE
A SERVICE PROVIDER

20:59.326 --> 21:02.729
FOR A RELIEF ORGANIZATION.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.632
- [chuckles]
YEAH, UM...

21:05.665 --> 21:07.867
W-WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
COMPLETELY ACCURATE,

21:07.900 --> 21:11.938
ALTHOUGH...
I CAN UNDERSTAND FROM...

21:11.971 --> 21:14.874
HOW INTENTIONALLY AMBIGUOUS
I WAS ABOUT MY JOB DESCRIPTION

21:14.907 --> 21:19.512
THAT YOU...
MIGHT ASSUME THAT, UH...

21:19.546 --> 21:21.348
THAT I SHIP
FOOD AND CLOTHING

21:21.381 --> 21:25.017
TO WAR-TORN REGIONS
OF THE GLOBE, WHEN...

21:25.051 --> 21:27.354
IN FACT, UH...

21:27.387 --> 21:29.689
THE SERVICE I PROVIDE...

21:31.958 --> 21:34.527
[clears throat]

IT'S A PORN SITE.

[both sigh]

21:51.944 --> 21:53.980
WELL, I GUESS
WE'D BETTER GET DRESSED.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.383
- NO, WAIT.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.891
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANTED TO TELL ME?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.526
- WELL, YEAH, I-I,
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT,

22:06.559 --> 22:08.795
AFTER EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOURSELF THAT...

22:08.828 --> 22:12.699
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT...

22:12.732 --> 22:16.135
- NO, NO.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.639
I'VE EVEN
BEEN ON THEM MYSELF.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.675
COUPLE TIMES.

22:22.709 --> 22:26.579
- YOU HAVE?

YOU'RE WHAT MATTERS.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.897

22:51.971 --> 22:54.874
- IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
[violin playing on CD]

22:54.907 --> 22:57.143
- HOOKED ON CLASSICS,
ARE WE?

22:57.176 --> 22:58.811
- YEAH, AND THE GUY
THAT PLAYED THE VIOLIN,

22:58.845 --> 23:01.047
I WISH YOU COULD'VE
BEEN THERE, HE WAS...

23:01.080 --> 23:05.618
HE WAS INCREDIBLE.
- INCREDIBLE, EH?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.954
- YOU KNOW,
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU

23:07.987 --> 23:11.458
TO EXPOSE YOURSELF
TO SOME CULTURE.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.993
- I'VE EXPOSED MYSELF
TO A LITTLE CULTURE.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.763
THERE WAS AN OBOE PLAYER
I MET AT THE BATHS ONCE.

- NO WAY.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.789
[chuckles]

23:42.822 --> 23:46.058
NO FUCKING WAY.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.794
I KNEW IT.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.796
ALL THAT BULLSHIT
ABOUT NOT DOING BIRTHDAYS.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.799
YOU WERE JUST GOING
TO SURPRISE ME.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.034

AFTER I ATE
SOME BAD MOO GOO GAI PAN.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.151

THE LEAST I COULD DO
IS WISH HIM A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

AND MANY MORE.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.952
[both chuckle]

I'VE HEARD ANYONE

27:03.856 --> 27:06.726
USE "EST" MORE TIMES

ABOUT TED'S PORN SITE.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.144
NOT EVERYONE WOULD BE.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.414

29:50.356 --> 29:51.423
- SO...
- PARTY'S OVER THEN.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.193
[mixed murmurs]

29:54.226 --> 29:57.196
- AND THIS IS THE GUY
WHO'S GOOD FOR MY SON.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.482
- AFTER ALL I WENT THROUGH

30:16.515 --> 30:19.051
TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL,
TO SURPRISE HIM,

30:19.085 --> 30:21.187
TO MAKE HIM HAPPY,
HOW COULD HE HUMILIATE ME

30:21.220 --> 30:23.055
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE
LIKE THAT?

30:23.089 --> 30:24.256
- HEY, WILL YOU SLOW DOWN?

30:24.290 --> 30:27.459
- AND HERE I AM, THINKING
HE'S SO WISE AND SO TOGETHER.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.196
YOU KNOW, THAT HE LIVES ON
SOME HIGHER SPIRITUAL PLANE

30:30.229 --> 30:32.031
THAN THE REST OF US POOR,
DUMB MORTALS.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.533
BOY, DID HE HAVE ME FOOLED.
WAS I FUCKING STUPID.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.202
- HEY, ARE YOU FINISHED?
- WHY?

30:36.235 --> 30:37.503
YOU IN A HURRY
TO PICK SOMEONE UP?

30:37.536 --> 30:39.371
- NO, I'M JUST TIRED
OF HEARING YOU PLAY

30:39.405 --> 30:41.307
VARIATIONS ON THE THEME
OF POOR LITTLE MIKEY.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.242
- OH, I'M SO SORRY
I BORE YOU.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.643
- WELL, THEN,
TRY ANOTHER SONG.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.245
- WHAT DID I DO?

30:46.278 --> 30:49.048
BESIDES THROW HIM
A GODDAMN PARTY?

30:49.081 --> 30:51.984
- YEAH, I'M JUST
PARKED OVER HERE.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.120
- NEVER MIND. FORGET IT.
GO TO WOODY'S.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.188
GET DRUNK. THROW UP.
PASS OUT.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.223
YOU'LL FEEL MUCH BETTER
IN THE MORNING.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.391
- NO! TELL ME.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.931
- YOU WANT TOO MUCH.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.500
YOU EXPECT TOO MUCH.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.036
AND THEN WHEN YOUR HERO
DISAPPOINTS YOU,

31:10.069 --> 31:11.437
YOUR POOR LITTLE HEART
GETS CRUSHED.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.605
- SO WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

31:13.639 --> 31:18.978
TO EXPECT NOTHING?
TO WANT NOTHING, LIKE YOU?

31:19.011 --> 31:21.513
- OH, UH, JACK AND GILLES,

31:21.547 --> 31:23.315
UH, ROLF FROM DUSSELDORF
IS ONLINE.

31:23.349 --> 31:26.618
HE WANTS YOU TWO TO DO A LITTLE
DOUBLE-HEADED DILDO ACTION.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.920
DANKE.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.989
[heavy breathing
on computer screens]

31:30.022 --> 31:32.658
HEY.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.394
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.
[chuckling]

31:35.427 --> 31:39.165
MMM. BETTER THAN NICE.
MM.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.933
- DID I COME AT A BAD TIME?

31:40.967 --> 31:42.701
- AROUND HERE,
NO SUCH THING.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.535
[both chuckle]

31:43.569 --> 31:46.205
HEY, LET ME GIVE YOU
THE V.I.P. TOUR.

31:46.238 --> 31:51.410
SO, THIS
IS MY LITTLE KINGDOM.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.479
OVER HERE,
YOU SEE THE BOYS

31:53.512 --> 31:55.514
DOING THEIR LITTLE THING...

31:55.547 --> 31:56.682
WITH THEIR BIG THINGS.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.018
OH, EASY, GUYS.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.387
YOU'VE GOT 15 MORE TO GO,
SO PACE YOURSELVES,

32:01.420 --> 32:04.723
PACE YOURSELVES.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.960
GOD, YOU ARE JUST
THE CUTEST.

32:07.994 --> 32:11.130
MM! BOY, IF MY MEMBERS
GOT ONE LOOK AT YOU, HMM!

32:11.163 --> 32:14.233
UH, DON'T WORRY.
NOBODY GETS YOU BUT ME.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.669
[performers moaning]

32:17.703 --> 32:19.438
WHAT?

32:19.471 --> 32:21.173
[performers moaning]

32:21.207 --> 32:23.609
- I, UH...

32:23.642 --> 32:26.578
I CAME TO TELL YOU, I-I THINK
WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.580
- TOO FAST?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.983
- IN FACT, I-I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER

32:31.017 --> 32:32.318
FOR A WHILE.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.487
- [scoffs]
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

32:41.360 --> 32:42.961
WHY?

32:46.265 --> 32:48.667
[performers grunting
and moaning]

32:51.670 --> 32:53.372
IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS,
ISN'T IT?

32:53.405 --> 32:55.074
- LOOK...

32:55.107 --> 32:56.508
I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.310
I TRIED NOT TO LET IT.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.347
LOOK, I-I EVEN TOLD MYSELF
IT'S JUST A JOB.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.649
LIKE ANY OTHER JOB,
YOU'RE PROVIDING A-A SERVICE.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.784
- THAT'S ALL IT IS.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.286
[performers groaning]

33:07.319 --> 33:10.289
[hand slapping flesh]

33:10.322 --> 33:12.324
- THAT'S NOT ALL IT IS.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.493
- NO. NO...
WAIT, WAIT!.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.462
- LOOK, PLEASE, DON'T
MAKE THIS MORE DIFFICULT...

33:16.495 --> 33:18.264
- LOOK, I'M WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES. OKAY?

33:18.297 --> 33:19.365
ANYTHING.
YOU NAME IT.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.100
I'LL GIVE IT UP.
- NO.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.736
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO GIVE UP DOING WHAT YOU LOVE.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.106
LOOK, BESIDES...

33:27.139 --> 33:29.508
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.642
IT'S MINE.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.312
- THEN WE'LL WORK ON IT
TOGETHER.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.051
- I'M SORRY, TED.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.614
- ALL RIGHT, EASY, GUYS.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.316
PACE YOURSELVES.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.452
PACE YOURSELVES.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.630
- SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
LEDA'S GOFERS?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.298
- SHE'S DOING US
A FAVOR.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.267
- WE HAD TO VOLUNTEER.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.670
- YEAH, WELL, NEXT TIME,
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR, AND ME.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.106
HIRE A PROFESSIONAL.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.142
- YEAH, YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT, HUH?

34:36.175 --> 34:38.177
- SHIT, I LEFT
MY CREDIT CARD.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.712
- YOU'RE SURE?
- BE RIGHT BACK.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.455
- SO I HEAR YOU FINALLY
BROKE DOWN

34:49.488 --> 34:51.590
AND GOT JUSTIN SOMETHING
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.425
A HUSTLER.
- YEAH.

34:53.459 --> 34:56.428
HE REALLY GOT OFF ON IT.

34:56.462 --> 34:57.829
- JUST WHAT HE NEEDS--

34:57.863 --> 34:59.231
TO GET LAID.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.532
- I DIDN'T HEAR HIM
COMPLAINING.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.668
- OF COURSE NOT,
HE WOULDN'T DARE.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.437
- THEN WHY ARE YOU?
- BECAUSE...

35:05.471 --> 35:07.139
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.875
- OH, FINALLY,
SOMEONE WHO ISN'T.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.210
- YOU MIGHT'VE GIVEN HIM

35:11.243 --> 35:12.444
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE
THOUGHTFUL.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.813
- WOULD YOU SAVE THE JEWISH
MOTHER GUILT TRIP FOR MY SON?

35:14.846 --> 35:15.814
- AH, FUCK OFF, BRIAN.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.217
I'M JUST TRYING TO LET YOU KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.619
- AND WHAT DOES HE WANT,
MAMA?

35:20.652 --> 35:23.622
- SOMETHING ROMANTIC.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.357
- JESUS CHRIST,
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

35:25.391 --> 35:27.693
A COUPLE OF DYKES?
- YOU SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.895
- MAYBE I SHOULD SEND HIM
A DOZEN ROSES.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.497
- WHY NOT?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.332
- BECAUSE HE'S NOT MY WIFE.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.302
WE'RE NOT MARRIED,
AND WE'RE NOT STRAIGHT.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.637
- COULDN'T YOU BEND YOUR...

35:38.670 --> 35:40.772
HOLIER-THAN-THOU, "I'M GAY
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT

35:40.806 --> 35:43.542
YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK"
PRINCIPLES JUST ONCE?

35:43.575 --> 35:44.876
LET HIM KNOW YOU CARE.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.513
- I THOUGHT HE DID.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.148
- GOT IT!

35:55.454 --> 35:58.424
[violin playing]

35:58.457 --> 36:06.465
*

36:42.334 --> 36:44.370
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE MAINTENANCE GUY.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.671
THERE'S NO HEAT.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.440
- SORRY.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.509
- IT'S OKAY.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.578
MAYBE THINGS WILL WARM UP
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.747
- [chuckles]

36:55.781 --> 36:57.583
I WAS, UM--

36:57.616 --> 36:59.351
I WAS JUST CUTTING THROUGH
THE MUSIC BUILDING,

36:59.385 --> 37:00.719
AND I HEARD SOMEONE
PLAYING.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.820
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE YOU.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.989
SO I POPPED
MY HEAD IN AND...

37:04.022 --> 37:05.457
- AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
YOU FOUND ME.

37:05.491 --> 37:06.492
YOU WANT SOME TEA?

37:06.525 --> 37:07.759
- NO.

37:10.496 --> 37:13.332
I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR THE CD.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.901
- YOU LISTENED TO IT?

37:15.934 --> 37:19.471
- SIX TIMES.
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

37:19.505 --> 37:22.374
- I KNOW.
HOW WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.875
DID YOU HAVE A BIG PARTY?

37:23.909 --> 37:26.345
- UM, NOT REALLY.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.546
MY BOYFRIEND
DOESN'T THINK BEING BORN

37:27.579 --> 37:29.615
IS A REASON TO CELEBRATE.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.784
- OH.
WELL, THAT SUCKS.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.786
- I DIDN'T REALLY WANT ONE
ANYWAY.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.588
- NO, I MEAN THAT YOU HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.858
- OH.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.327
- BECAUSE IF I
WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND,

37:41.360 --> 37:43.362
I'D GIVE YOU A BIRTHDAY
YOU'D NEVER FORGET.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.897
- [chuckles]
LIKE WHAT?

37:45.931 --> 37:49.335
- LIKE...FIRST...

37:49.368 --> 37:53.372
I'D BRING YOU BREAKFAST
IN BED.

37:53.405 --> 37:56.608
AND THEN I'D PLAY
FOR YOU...

37:56.642 --> 37:59.445
ONE OF RAVEL'S
VALSE NOBLE ET SENTIMENTALES,

37:59.478 --> 38:01.380
BECAUSE THAT'S
HOW I PICTURE YOU,

38:01.413 --> 38:04.416
NOBLE AND SENTIMENTAL.

38:06.485 --> 38:11.890
AND THEN WE'D MAKE LOVE
A COUPLE HUNDRED TIMES.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.726
- [chuckles]
ALL THAT BEFORE LUNCH?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.628
- YES.

38:18.797 --> 38:22.601
BUT I'M NOT
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.873
- I GOTTA...
GET BACK TO CLASS.

38:30.376 --> 38:33.379
[ticking]

38:37.683 --> 38:40.652
[playing]

38:40.686 --> 38:45.557
*

38:45.591 --> 38:47.526
[knock on door]

39:09.848 --> 39:13.385
- I'VE MISSED YOU
THE LAST FEW NIGHTS.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.120
- YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
IT'D BE BEST IF I SLEPT ALONE.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.221
YOU KNOW?

39:16.254 --> 39:21.126
IN FACT, I THINK I OUGHT
TO SLEEP ALONE FROM NOW ON.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.894
- MICHAEL...

39:22.928 --> 39:24.396
PLEASE.

39:24.430 --> 39:25.664
I KNOW I GOT A LITTLE UPSET
AT THE PARTY--

39:25.697 --> 39:28.867
- A LITTLE UPSET?
YOU WERE A FUCKING MONSTER!

39:28.900 --> 39:30.636
HUMILIATING ME,
HUMILIATING YOURSELF.

39:30.669 --> 39:31.970
- I KNOW THAT TOO.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.138
- AND AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE
I WENT THROUGH FOR YOU.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.406
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.774
- WELL, I WON'T
BE DOING THAT AGAIN.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.942
I MEAN, NOT THAT IT MATTERS,
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK

39:36.975 --> 39:38.610
WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING
ANY MORE BIRTHDAYS TOGETHER.

39:38.644 --> 39:39.911
- MY T-CELLS WENT DOWN.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.047
- WHAT?

39:42.080 --> 39:45.651
- AND MY VIRAL LOAD'S
BACK UP.

39:47.786 --> 39:51.490
- HOW UP?
- 125,000.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.727
THAT'S WHERE I WAS
BEFORE I CAME HOME,

39:55.761 --> 39:59.531
AT THE DOCTOR'S,
GETTING THE RESULTS.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.467
THE COCKTAIL'S NOT WORKING.

40:01.500 --> 40:05.737
THE VIRUS HAS BECOME
RESISTANT.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.072
- WELL, CAN'T THEY
CHANGE THE DRUGS?

40:07.105 --> 40:09.407
- THEY ALREADY HAVE.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.514
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU SMOKE?

40:17.816 --> 40:20.018
[shuts lighter]

40:20.051 --> 40:22.621
- SINCE I'M NERVOUS,
MICHAEL.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.823
WOULD YOU STOP
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

40:24.856 --> 40:27.659
PLEASE.
I'M NOT PERFECT, YOU KNOW?

40:29.928 --> 40:31.096
- YEAH,
I'M FINDING THAT OUT.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.564
- WELL, GOD KNOWS,
I HAVE TRIED.

40:32.598 --> 40:33.999
EASTERN RELIGION,
MEDITATION, YOGA.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.567
YOU NAME IT,
I HAVE PRACTICED IT.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.470
HOPING TO ACHIEVE SOME...
STATE OF INNER HARMONY.

40:38.504 --> 40:41.707
[sighs and chuckles]

40:41.740 --> 40:42.974
AND THEN THIS HAPPENS,
AND I REALIZE

40:43.008 --> 40:45.511
THE ONLY THING
I HAVE ACHIEVED

40:45.544 --> 40:49.047
IS TO CONVINCE MYSELF
I BELIEVE ALL THIS BULLSHIT.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.017
- IT'S NOT BULLSHIT.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.887
- I HURT YOU, MICHAEL.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.692
I HURT THE ONE PERSON

41:00.726 --> 41:03.829
WHO MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD,

41:03.862 --> 41:09.134
AND THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR IT.

41:09.167 --> 41:12.137
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
JUST NO EXCUSE AT ALL.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.879
- SURE THERE IS.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.952
YOU'RE HUMAN.

- MM.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.129
- SHALL I WRAP THEM FOR YOU?

43:28.039 --> 43:30.275
- NO, THANKS.

44:13.018 --> 44:15.787
* SO CLOSE AT HAND

44:15.821 --> 44:18.857
* BUT YOU MOSTLY FLY OVER

44:18.890 --> 44:21.059
* YOU NEVER LAND

44:21.092 --> 44:24.295
* EVEN A SECOND THOUGHT

44:24.329 --> 44:29.835
* HIDING IN PERFECT DISGUISE

44:29.868 --> 44:32.738
* IN PLAIN SIGHT

44:32.771 --> 44:35.240
* FRIENDS AND RELATIONS

44:35.273 --> 44:37.442
* HAVE TRIED TO SAY

44:37.475 --> 44:40.145
* BUT YOU'LL HAVE NONE OF IT

44:40.178 --> 44:43.114
* BUT THE PROTEST

44:43.148 --> 44:45.350
* OH

44:45.383 --> 44:49.320
* 'CAUSE YOU KNOW

44:49.354 --> 44:54.860
* YOU KNOW BETTER

44:54.893 --> 44:59.731
* THE MOON SNEAKS UP

44:59.765 --> 45:04.302
* ON THE AFTERNOON

45:04.335 --> 45:07.472
* BUT YOU'VE LOOKED DOWN

45:07.505 --> 45:13.078
* SO LONG AT YOUR FEET

45:13.111 --> 45:15.380
*

45:15.413 --> 45:18.817
* AT YOUR FEET

45:18.850 --> 45:21.486
*

45:21.519 --> 45:26.758
* FOR SO LONG

45:26.792 --> 45:32.530
* AT YOUR FEET

45:32.563 --> 45:37.535
* SO LONG

45:37.568 --> 45:41.139
* IN PLAIN SIGHT
