WEBVTT

00:01.852 --> 00:07.039
I just found out we're getting
my stew from my boat in florida.

00:07.091 --> 00:08.490
I feel threatened.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.209
I understand what
happened between you and heather

00:10.261 --> 00:11.427
was completely uncalled for.

00:11.462 --> 00:12.344
Mm-hmm.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.513
And I have your back
on that 100 percent.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.515
You kinda shrugged it off,
and it made me feel like

00:16.550 --> 00:18.434
oh, I can't even
really trust my boss.

00:18.469 --> 00:20.602
I hear you, and I'm sorry
that I hurt your feelings.

00:20.638 --> 00:21.854
-That's okay.
-That never was my intention.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.138
Can you trust me?

00:23.173 --> 00:25.274
-We shall see.
-We shall see?

00:25.309 --> 00:26.508
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.410
I want to apologize
for something

00:28.446 --> 00:31.230
that you weren't around for,
and that was my apprehension.

00:31.282 --> 00:34.867
But you've taken initiative
and you've respected me,

00:34.902 --> 00:36.285
and I really appreciate that.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.238
I was just being
a little brat.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.073
We got a short turnaround
on this tomorrow.

00:41.125 --> 00:44.626
One more to go.
Do not ease up.

01:08.486 --> 01:09.685
[alarm beeps]

01:10.938 --> 01:12.053
ugh.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.238
I am so tired.

01:15.526 --> 01:16.992
[bleep]

01:23.667 --> 01:24.883
hey, dawg.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.136
Good morning.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.538
So, I'm interested
to find out... How is she?

01:29.557 --> 01:31.540
She acclimated quite well
to it, quick.

01:31.575 --> 01:32.424
Good.

01:32.476 --> 01:34.709
I think it was good
she knows heather,

01:34.728 --> 01:36.762
so it just made it
really comfortable for her.

01:36.814 --> 01:38.880
Yeah, I ----ing love rachel.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.766
Thank god for eddie and her.

01:40.818 --> 01:42.601
They're allowing me to work
more in the galley

01:42.653 --> 01:44.269
this next charter.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.188
-A sous chef?
-Exactly.

01:47.491 --> 01:49.241
Mm.
Ugh.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.582
This season has been
a difficult one.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.334
It kills me to think
that rayna didn't think

01:59.370 --> 02:01.920
of me as a support,
as an ally, as a friend.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.906
It's a really sh-- feeling.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.041
Like I let someone down.

02:07.978 --> 02:09.912
My back is killing me
right now.

02:09.947 --> 02:12.181
Ugh, oof.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.633
-Call me...
-Sure.

02:14.685 --> 02:16.268
As soon as those cabins are done
so we can attack the next thing.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.636
-Yes.
-Awesome.

02:17.688 --> 02:18.854
Beautiful!

02:18.889 --> 02:20.088
-How you doing?
-Good.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.523
Yeah?

02:21.559 --> 02:22.941
You gave me that
"I'm in trouble" look already.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.777
You are not in any trouble.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.362
Okay, what?

02:27.398 --> 02:30.315
So, one thing that hasn't
been sitting well with me.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.768
You were still upset
by what heather said.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.404
You didn't feel like I backed
you up or supported you, and...

02:35.439 --> 02:36.205
Okay.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.273
I am so sorry for
that, and I...

02:38.292 --> 02:40.325
That is the last thing
that I would ever wanna do.

02:40.377 --> 02:42.961
And so, I wanna do whatever
I can to support you.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.830
With that being said,
would you like

02:44.882 --> 02:47.666
if I grabbed heather and
we just killed this thing?

02:47.718 --> 02:49.518
-No.
-You don't wanna do that?

02:49.553 --> 02:51.970
No, I'm tired off talking
to heather about it.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.955
Okay, if you don't
feel comfortable talking to her,

02:53.974 --> 02:54.956
then I will respect that.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.508
But one thing also about you

02:56.560 --> 02:57.976
is that you don't
express when you're upset.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.645
No, I don't.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.980
Will you do me a favor, and if
ever you feel upset, talk to me.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.398
Yeah.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.683
That's why I'm here,
and I like you.

03:04.735 --> 03:05.800
As rachel would say,

03:05.819 --> 03:09.238
let's [bleep] this charter
in the mouth, all right?

03:09.273 --> 03:10.739
-[bleep] yeah.
-[bleep] yeah.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.990
Eddie, rachel, heather,

03:12.026 --> 03:13.659
<i> I need you guys down in</i>
<i> the crew mess</i>

03:13.694 --> 03:15.510
<i> for a preference sheet</i>
<i> meeting, please.</i>

03:15.546 --> 03:16.695
Copy.

03:20.584 --> 03:21.833
Goddamn it!

03:23.921 --> 03:25.537
The last one of
the season, kids.

03:25.589 --> 03:28.006
Primary charter guest
is jennifer yeo.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.709
Jennifer is a real
estate entrepreneur

03:30.761 --> 03:32.594
who's one of the
most successful in utah.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.963
She's ready to celebrate
her booming business

03:34.998 --> 03:36.598
by enjoying the charter
of a lifetime,

03:36.634 --> 03:39.384
accompanied by her husband,
darin, and her friends.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.436
No cooked fish of any sort.

03:41.472 --> 03:45.607
And dinner, the guests are
requesting a white party.

03:45.643 --> 03:50.045
They ask for the chef
to "curate" a meal

03:50.080 --> 03:51.346
featuring dishes
from an assortment

03:51.382 --> 03:52.915
of their favorite cuisines.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.383
Sure.

03:54.418 --> 03:56.618
They want a jungle safari
beach party on day two.

03:56.654 --> 03:57.452
Awesome.

03:57.488 --> 04:01.056
Glitz and glam
formal dinner party.

04:01.091 --> 04:02.708
Well, this is gonna be fun.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.559
We'll be leaving
the dock at 11:00.

04:04.595 --> 04:07.629
-Thank you, good sir.
-See ya, cap.

04:08.966 --> 04:10.299
Thank you.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.372

04:17.391 --> 04:18.390
-Bring it!
-You guys ready for this?

04:18.425 --> 04:20.075
The guests get on at 11:00.

04:20.110 --> 04:21.944
Pure action, pure energy.

04:21.979 --> 04:25.580
We're all exhausted,
but we've got one more push.

04:25.616 --> 04:27.566
The slide?
Goin' out!

04:27.601 --> 04:29.985
It's time for macho man
eddie to come out.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.739
The jet-skis...
Haulin' ass.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.441
Let's go, brother,
oh, yeah!

04:36.493 --> 04:38.093
All right,
y'all know what to do.

04:38.128 --> 04:39.094
I don't even have to tell you.

04:39.129 --> 04:40.796
Let's get 'er done.

04:40.831 --> 04:42.798
You ready to take
it off the dock today?

04:42.833 --> 04:44.499
Well actually, cap,
I was wondering,

04:44.535 --> 04:46.251
if it was okay with you...

04:50.874 --> 04:52.007
[snorts]

04:52.042 --> 04:53.342
whoa.

04:53.377 --> 04:56.111
<i> Attention all crew,</i>

05:03.437 --> 05:05.454
oh, no, no, that's not cocaine.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.111
The trash.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.529
Sh-- tickets here.

05:16.033 --> 05:17.366
Everything's done.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.567
I'm sure this is fine.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.538
Attention all crew,
attention all crew,

05:23.574 --> 05:25.123
<i> 30 minutes to show time, folks.</i>

05:25.159 --> 05:28.443
This is the last one, guys,
so let's hit it outta the park.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.278
-Woo-hoo.
-Deck team copies.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.830
Ugh!

05:38.422 --> 05:39.638
Mm, mm, mm.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.625
-Rachel?
-Yes?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.160

05:54.438 --> 05:55.937
Pull that fender up there.

05:55.972 --> 05:58.156
<i> Ten minutes to show time,</i>
<i> everybody, 10 minutes.</i>

05:58.192 --> 06:01.176
Can you dig it?

06:01.211 --> 06:02.778
All righty.

06:02.813 --> 06:05.697
If you could take
the towels out, and the tray.

06:05.749 --> 06:08.033
Interior, interior,
everything looks great,

06:08.085 --> 06:09.484
thank you so much.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.386
I hate it when you
get dirty feet... Oh!

06:11.422 --> 06:13.038
[laughing]

06:13.090 --> 06:14.373
stupid.

06:14.425 --> 06:15.857
Kaylee, do you want to
hold on to these?

06:15.893 --> 06:16.842
Sure.

06:19.763 --> 06:20.662
Yeah.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.180
-Oh, congratulations!
-Oh, my goodness!

06:22.216 --> 06:24.566
-So excited.
-First and last.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.167
Let's ----ing go!

06:26.186 --> 06:28.186
Oh, look how gorgeous
it is, guys.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.472
Fast turnaround,
zero recovery.

06:30.507 --> 06:31.940
All right, heads up, people.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.676
But more money, more money,
more money, spin.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.344
Oh, they're all lined up,
it's so cool.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.679
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

06:37.714 --> 06:39.214
-I'm captain lee.
-Nice to meet you.

06:39.249 --> 06:40.899
-We're glad to be here.
-Hi, cap.

06:40.951 --> 06:42.350
Oh, hi!

06:42.369 --> 06:43.702
Nice to meet you, I'm jake.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.703
-We got a hugger!
-I'm such a hugger.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.121
Welcome aboard my seanna.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.789
Heather's gonna give you
a tour of the yacht,

06:47.825 --> 06:49.207
and we'll get the
party started...

06:49.243 --> 06:50.909
-Woohoo!
-Let's do this!

06:50.961 --> 06:51.927
Thank you!

06:51.962 --> 06:52.694
Deck crew, blues.

06:52.729 --> 06:54.396
All right, let's start the tour.

06:54.431 --> 06:56.214
This is what we call
the bridge deck aft.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.100
Don't forget that,
darin, it's aft.

06:58.135 --> 06:59.835
Yes, aft, backwards...
Got it.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.337
It's fine.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.140
Uh, we've got the luggage.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.008
This is where you do
the trust fall from.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.886
So, this is your
living quarters...

07:17.921 --> 07:19.888
Master suite room.

07:19.923 --> 07:22.958
Oh, this is where
we get ready. Jen's room!

07:22.993 --> 07:25.160
Yeah!

07:25.195 --> 07:26.528
Jesus.

07:26.563 --> 07:28.663
We gotta find our favorite spot.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.966
-Cheese plate is beautiful.
-Thank you.

07:31.001 --> 07:32.534
<i> Engineering,</i>
<i> engineering, bridge.</i>

07:32.569 --> 07:34.202
<i> Bridge, go ahead</i>
<i> for engineering.</i>

07:34.237 --> 07:36.421
Hey, alex, when you have a
moment, please fire 'em up?

07:36.457 --> 07:38.373
<i> Roger that, firing up.</i>

07:39.643 --> 07:41.259
Me and stevie
need champagne.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.145
There she is...
Oh, there he is.

07:43.180 --> 07:46.515
I gonna choose "he," but we can
go with anything you like.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.487
Oh, something just
went off, oh, no.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.689
Wes, wes, jake, can you give
me a hand on main deck?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.641
Yeah, copy that, on my way down.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.160
You wanna go get changed
into your blues real quick?

07:58.195 --> 08:00.729
I'd love to.

08:00.764 --> 08:02.631
[bleep]
eddie, eddie, jake.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.282
<i> We need your help on the dock.</i>

08:04.318 --> 08:05.867
Copy, on my way.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.789
Something happened.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.273
Yeah, it's something
important.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.441
[bleep]

08:17.631 --> 08:19.130
leaving the engines running

08:19.166 --> 08:21.883
and walking off from the
wheelhouse is never acceptable.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.655
Coming up...

08:26.690 --> 08:28.173
Fraser, if you just wanna
handle the guests,

08:28.225 --> 08:29.808
-I'll bring the lunch down.
-Copy that.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.593
I've just done
a full check of the guests.

08:32.896 --> 08:35.313
Like, this is literally
one thing after another.

08:35.349 --> 08:38.850
You said "copy," and then still
did the opposite of what I said,

08:38.902 --> 08:42.437
and it makes it look like
my word doesn't stand.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.891
Eddie, we need your help.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.925
Copy, on my way.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.926
Who tied this up?

08:47.945 --> 08:48.927
Something happened.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.095
Sh--.

08:54.468 --> 08:55.934
-How'd this happen?
-I don't know.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.102
Well, our luggage is on,
so it's not our problem.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.205
Oh!

09:00.240 --> 09:02.941
Oh, it's garbage...
Oh, good job!

09:02.960 --> 09:05.644
I'm gonna go over and help them.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.245
Saved!

09:07.281 --> 09:09.581
Oh, snacks, snacks, snacks!

09:09.616 --> 09:11.750
This is so nice.

09:11.785 --> 09:12.884
-Eddie?
-Yes, sir?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.786
-Rule number one.
-Huh?

09:14.805 --> 09:17.422
Never, ever leave
the bridge unattended

09:17.457 --> 09:20.959
with everything fired up...
Ever.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.627
So, what would you have done?

09:22.646 --> 09:24.312
-Shut everything down.
-Shut everything down.

09:24.348 --> 09:26.514
Especially the mains,
because you have no idea

09:26.567 --> 09:29.133
what could transpire
with electronic controls.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.185
They'll pop into gear...

09:30.237 --> 09:31.570
A lesson I learned the hard way.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.004
So, you can go ahead and
do your gear checks

09:33.040 --> 09:34.439
whenever you're ready, sir.

09:36.693 --> 09:38.009
Get outta the way!

09:38.045 --> 09:39.277
What the hell happened?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.495
-I was down in the crew.
-I have no idea.

09:40.530 --> 09:41.680
Bow line just ripped
that pylon off.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.531
Settle down,
take a deep breath

09:43.584 --> 09:45.116
before you decide
to depart the dock.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.618
All right, y'all,
bow to stern,

09:46.653 --> 09:48.003
leave the forward
spring line till last.

09:48.038 --> 09:49.588
Copy.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.256
That's what gives these guys
the kick-ass arms.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.757
<i> -All lines clear?</i>
<i> -All lines are clear.</i>

09:52.793 --> 09:53.792
All right, here we go.

09:55.545 --> 09:57.495
Stern is six feet
off the dock.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.466
Another degree to port.

10:07.057 --> 10:08.506
Boom!

10:08.525 --> 10:10.725
Looking good.
Feeling good.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.143
Good job, eddie.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.478
Thanks, cap.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.618
Beautiful.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.619
Mediterranean...

10:20.654 --> 10:23.038
That's the one common thing
that everybody

10:23.073 --> 10:24.956
has on their preference sheet.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.726
We have hummous, we got feta,
we've got lamb.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.245
I'm gonna tap-tap-tapas
this thing in the face.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.880
Okay, what can I do for you?

10:31.915 --> 10:33.832
Just the pita bread
on a tray real quick.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.635
I wanna friggin' titanic
this [bleep].

10:36.670 --> 10:38.053
Hey, girls!

10:38.088 --> 10:39.587
We're going to the bunny deck.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.506
-Oh, well, they covered it.
-What?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.010
Deck team, deck team,
ready the anchor.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.061
Copy.

10:46.096 --> 10:47.746
This was a bad idea!

10:47.781 --> 10:48.813
It was a good try.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.848
-You wanna drop?
-Yeah.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.182
Okay, go ahead and drop.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.888
<i> Long stay, 2:00.</i>

10:56.907 --> 10:58.406
That's good.

10:58.442 --> 10:59.424
-Anchor's secured.
<i> -Thank you very much.</i>

10:59.459 --> 11:01.076
That's how you do it.

11:01.111 --> 11:02.761
<i> Anchor ball is up.</i>

11:02.796 --> 11:05.080
<i> Deck crew, go ahead and</i>
<i> get the water toys out.</i>

11:05.115 --> 11:06.414
What in the world...

11:08.251 --> 11:09.834
Mother----er.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.103
Fraser, you're cleared
to invite them to the table.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.104
Copy.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.923
[humming]

11:14.958 --> 11:16.474
can I invite you to
be seated for your lunch,

11:16.510 --> 11:17.842
-if you're ready for that?
-Yay!

11:19.379 --> 11:20.979
Look at this cute silverware.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.213
-Don't be shy.
-Ugh!

11:22.248 --> 11:23.548
Don't be shy, son.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.352
-Still or sparkling?
-Still's fine.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.436
Okay, great.

11:28.472 --> 11:29.938
So, I think the water's good.

11:29.973 --> 11:31.389
May I ask what's wrong
with the water?

11:31.424 --> 11:33.608
It just tastes a little...

11:33.643 --> 11:35.894
The last thing I want
is local water.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.113
-Can I have sparkling?
-Yeah, okay, sure.

11:38.148 --> 11:39.397
No, that's absolutely fine.

11:39.433 --> 11:40.398
Thank you so much.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.766
These guys are a bit basic.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.335
However, I'm not
complaining about that,

11:44.371 --> 11:46.604
because service is
what I adore.

11:46.623 --> 11:51.543
So, I'll do those
mind-numbingly basic tasks.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.630
Anything's better than
watching the laundry spin.

11:55.665 --> 11:56.948
-Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

11:58.668 --> 12:00.452
Follow with the orzo salad.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.387
Orzo salad?

12:04.124 --> 12:05.289
Copy.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.307
Would you like some
orzo salad?

12:06.343 --> 12:07.392
Yes!

12:07.427 --> 12:08.593
Holy sh--, that looks so good.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.894
She's just incredible.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.901
That's how it is down south.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.156
I forgot that he was born
in the caribbean.

12:21.191 --> 12:22.157
Is it nevis?

12:22.192 --> 12:23.408
-Yes, look.
-No way!

12:23.443 --> 12:25.176
Get the freak out.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.177
-Mm-hmm.
-That was his house?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.178
Big fans.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.580
Get me a car.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.081
It doesn't look like
it still exists.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.666
Oh, sweet baby jesus.

12:31.701 --> 12:34.035
All right, main deck,
y'all ready for some flakes?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.620
Yes, you can flake her down.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.007
-Yeah!
-There's the slide!

12:39.042 --> 12:40.175
Hey, kay, did you eat yet?

12:40.210 --> 12:41.559
No, I haven't.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.794
I'm trying to bang
this laundry out!

12:44.598 --> 12:46.798
Oh, you got
the water trampoline out.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.850
-Is it swimsuit time?
-Yeah, go.

12:48.885 --> 12:50.602
If we could just
have directionals

12:50.637 --> 12:51.970
to your guys' bedroom,
that'd be great.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.839
That's it.

12:54.858 --> 12:59.394
♪ step up,
step up, up, step up ♪

12:59.446 --> 13:01.780
oh, fun, I'm ready.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.215
I can't believe
we're doing this.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.483
Ah!

13:09.389 --> 13:11.206
Woo-hoo!

13:11.241 --> 13:12.991
Go pay my dues,
earn my money.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.826
[chuckles]

13:14.861 --> 13:15.743
oh, god.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.869
I'm gonna put you
on balloon duty.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.905
Blowing eight with
the string pretty long.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.207
There we go,
three, two, one...

13:29.242 --> 13:30.425
My seanna!

13:32.045 --> 13:33.244
-Eww!
-What?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.979
It's dirty!

13:36.283 --> 13:37.782
I'm sure you've
sucked on worse.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.817
Woo!

13:42.455 --> 13:43.688
-Thank you.
-No worries.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.256
Oh, our balls dropped.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.892
Tomorrow we're gonna set
up the beach picnic here.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.528
That sounds great.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.529
Yeah, that mojito
was really nice.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.530
Coming right up.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.781
[fraser hiccups]

13:53.834 --> 13:54.532
pardon me.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.201
We're leaving the slide out,

13:56.236 --> 13:57.268
and we're doing the beach
setup right there.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.269
Oh, my god.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.737
He can hear my prayers.

13:59.773 --> 14:00.939
<i> Rayna, do you wanna</i>
<i> do the davit?</i>

14:00.974 --> 14:01.873
<i> Yeah.</i>

14:03.143 --> 14:04.275
Copy.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.510
They're good, but woo!

14:05.545 --> 14:07.712
Get this party goin'.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.264
I like doing the aft one first,

14:09.299 --> 14:11.182
because that way you got a
lot of space with the boom.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.600
-I'll do that.
-Cool.

14:12.636 --> 14:14.719
Okay, let's see what she does.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.288
Wedging out.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.090
You gotta make sure it's, like,
kind of right in the right spot.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.275
Sometimes it can be
a little sensitive with those,

14:20.310 --> 14:21.559
like, the location.

14:21.595 --> 14:22.660
Please wear pearls.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.662
It's a white party.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.097
All right, that's good,

14:26.116 --> 14:27.282
and maybe, you know, boom
up now a little bit.

14:27.317 --> 14:28.566
Hold there.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.784
-That's good.
-Good, good.

14:29.819 --> 14:30.735
Good job.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.573
Ow, that really hurt!

14:41.114 --> 14:42.914
Is it available?

14:42.949 --> 14:45.550
Do you think we should go down
to stevie, like just bust in?

14:45.585 --> 14:47.118
Yeah, she's just laying there.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.554
Y'all know how I feel
about the lamb chops.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.722
Did the ladies take off?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.323
-Pep rally.
-I like it.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.725
Hype-up time.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.460
Girls, you're both pretty.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.313
Come get your
asses up the stairs.

14:58.348 --> 14:59.964
They're doing good.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.135
Yay!

15:04.170 --> 15:06.537
-We got 'er!
-Nice rally, everybody.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.777
You're gonna have to go
on the search.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.700
What the... Ugh.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.253
I'm lost.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.621
Go down a deck and just start
going, "ca-caw, champagne!"

15:23.656 --> 15:25.857
-go down one?
-Ca-caw!

15:25.892 --> 15:27.008
I'm very excited
for our night out.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.561
There we go,
there's captain lee.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.547
Okay, so you can go
ask captain lee.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.632
No, I'm not asking
----ing captain lee

15:34.668 --> 15:36.501
for ----ing champagne.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.603
Son of a bitch.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.054
I don't see anybody
out there now.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.007
-Danny, do not.
-Oh, jesus christ.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.575
You're paying how much money?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.278
Oh, my god.
They'll come up.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.613
Yeah, that's what I figure.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.481
We are not even close to
the goddamn finish line.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.483
Mm, this is so good.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.569
Either get your heads
out of your ass,

15:54.621 --> 15:56.654
or I will eat your ass.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.523
All right, fraser's
going to sleep.

16:00.710 --> 16:01.859
Hey, cap.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.161
Good evening, captain.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.696
Hm, this is interesting.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.998
There's no time I should
ever see everybody

16:07.033 --> 16:10.368
sitting down at this table
at the same ----ing time.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.669
----Ing pissed.

16:12.422 --> 16:14.255
Coming up...

16:14.307 --> 16:17.058
I'm, like, so grumpy and over
people being grumpy and over it.

16:17.093 --> 16:18.309
Oh.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.745
I think I can only handle people
being short with me so much.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.563
The vibe on the boat
sucks right now.

16:22.599 --> 16:24.849
We need a serious bounce-back.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.818
People are like,
"I'm just ----ing exhausted."

16:26.853 --> 16:28.019
so I'm like,
"yeah, cool, so am I."

16:31.775 --> 16:34.792
there's no time

16:34.844 --> 16:37.428
at this table at the
same ----ing time.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.749
I got people upstairs
wandering around the boat,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.968
looking for somebody to
get 'em drinks and stuff.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.520
Ca-caw, champagne!

16:45.555 --> 16:47.021
Point me in
the right direction.

16:47.057 --> 16:48.473
And not a swinging...

16:49.559 --> 16:50.525
And not a swinging
dick up there.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.994
Where's my champagne?

16:53.029 --> 16:55.329
Why has it been 20 minutes since
someone served me something?

16:55.365 --> 16:56.898
If I see it again,

16:56.933 --> 17:00.101
there's gonna be ----ing hell
to pay, count on it.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.302
Yes, sir.

17:05.408 --> 17:07.625
Gentlemen, can I get
you a fresh beer?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.610
No, they want champagne
for the sunset.

17:09.646 --> 17:13.014
Beautiful, group champagne
flute coming up.

17:13.049 --> 17:14.448
Thank you.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.617
Well, that's how you get
a crew mess silent.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.451
Ugh.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.886
-Prosecco?
-Yeah.

17:23.593 --> 17:24.976
I'm gonna set this down.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.511
-Thank you.
-Amazing.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.046
-Give me something to do.
-Let's get the bowls.

17:29.099 --> 17:31.015
Can I top off your glass
before you head down?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.433
You good?

17:32.469 --> 17:33.468
I'm pretty sure this
is plenty, thank you.

17:33.503 --> 17:34.936
Okay.
Awesome.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.305
The guests have requested
a white party tonight.

17:37.340 --> 17:38.773
It's so tacky.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.142
Shall we pre-hydrate
for our drinking level?

17:41.177 --> 17:43.044
[laughing]

17:43.079 --> 17:46.314
I just think we can
provide the highest quality

17:46.349 --> 17:49.650
of hospitality
without this fluff.

17:49.685 --> 17:51.352
Look at how good that looks.

17:51.387 --> 17:53.488
That's ----ing awesome.

17:53.523 --> 17:55.389
But hey, that's not my job.

17:57.127 --> 17:58.075
Yet.

17:59.429 --> 18:00.694
Rachel, did I need
to grab the chips?

18:00.713 --> 18:01.963
Oh, you have the chips.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.414
But we need the crackers.

18:03.466 --> 18:05.633
Do you guys have crackers
to fill in the bowl?

18:05.668 --> 18:07.068
And then we've got
the chips then,

18:07.103 --> 18:08.836
and we got salsa and
all of that going up.

18:10.807 --> 18:12.807
You should do, like,
a lady gaga dance right now.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.175
Go ahead and grab the hummous,

18:14.210 --> 18:15.510
which is right here,
these two containers.

18:15.545 --> 18:17.178
Mix those together in there.

18:17.213 --> 18:18.846
Perfect.

18:18.882 --> 18:20.681
All right, you want me to take
the chips and the crackers up?

18:20.716 --> 18:22.049
Yeah, if you guys wanna
take 'em up, that'd be awesome.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.684
And then we'll
finish up with that guac.

18:23.719 --> 18:24.886
Cool.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.122
I already see where
this is going.

18:28.158 --> 18:30.191
Did you hear me say
"fill the cracker bowl?"

18:30.226 --> 18:31.359
yeah, five times.

18:31.394 --> 18:32.760
What the [bleep]?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.833
I just love
everything she does.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.835
Like, of course I'm gonna
take rachel's side.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.338
She could ----ing cuss me out
and I'd be like, "yeah."

18:45.708 --> 18:47.375
there they are now.

18:47.410 --> 18:49.227
-This is hot as [bleep].
-Okay.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.761
How you guys doing down there?

18:50.814 --> 18:52.713
Chaos has yet to begin.
It's a very busy meal.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.715
All right, so the
calm before the storm.

18:54.734 --> 18:55.783

-White party.

19:12.035 --> 19:13.000
This is awesome.

19:13.036 --> 19:14.368
And we need to go ahead
and start plating these.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.636
Soups?

19:15.672 --> 19:17.255
This is the last leg
of the race.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.407
Everyone's tired, and
I'm getting a little frustrated.

19:19.442 --> 19:21.042
No, no, no, nein.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.911
We need to open up our line
of communication way better.

19:23.930 --> 19:24.946
Ladling it.

19:24.981 --> 19:27.048

Okay, rachel,
the guests are sitting now.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.522
Copy that.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.644
I don't think they said that.

19:39.696 --> 19:41.229
-I think it was.
-They did say...

-"shoes are the key to life."

I can keep those enclosed.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.438

Yes.

19:58.648 --> 20:00.114
I'm gonna jump in here.

20:00.133 --> 20:04.618

-Yeah.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.191
-Is that good?
-Yeah.

21:00.226 --> 21:04.678
This alcohol in the caribbean

Holy cow.

21:47.323 --> 21:48.622
Oh, yeah, lobster
has to be cooked.

21:48.658 --> 21:49.723
In butter.

21:49.742 --> 21:50.992
It's actually really good.

21:51.027 --> 21:52.059
Oh, my gosh.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.830
How's it tasting?

21:55.865 --> 21:58.416
[bleep] I mean, I put on
my preference sheet

21:58.451 --> 22:00.167
a million times,
"no cooked fish."

22:00.203 --> 22:03.004
shellfish, it's a fish.
My apologies.

22:03.039 --> 22:05.006
It's weird, I can eat
raw all day long.

22:05.041 --> 22:05.923
Right.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.408
Cooked, it's a texture
thing for me.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.409
Yeah, is it?

22:08.428 --> 22:09.410
Here we go again.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.644
Rachel has completely forgotten

22:10.680 --> 22:13.047
that the primary
doesn't eat cooked fish.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.649
They must have forgotten
about the primary.

22:15.685 --> 22:18.803
Clearly, we're all
exd, but...

22:18.855 --> 22:20.104
Oh, lord help me.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.789
I'm real sorry about
that for you...

22:21.824 --> 22:23.958
-It's okay.
-But it's really good.

22:23.993 --> 22:24.775
What?

22:24.811 --> 22:26.160
No cooked fish.

22:26.195 --> 22:28.462
I put on there a million
times in bold letters,

22:28.498 --> 22:30.614
"no cooked fish for me."

22:30.650 --> 22:32.066
no cooked fish of any sort,

22:32.101 --> 22:34.201

"yeah, shellfish."

22:43.513 --> 22:45.129
No cooked fish of any sort,

22:45.164 --> 22:46.780
and she was like,
"yeah, shellfish."

22:46.799 --> 22:48.966
it's okay, I'll make her
another one really quickly.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.301
No, she said no.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.719
-Oh, she said...
-She said she's good.

22:51.754 --> 22:52.837
Goddamnn it.

22:52.889 --> 22:54.805
With the prior charters being
a little bit dramatic...

22:54.841 --> 22:56.974
The preference sheet didn't
say dairy intolerance.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.761
It says, "what do you not eat,"
and we said "cheese and pork."

23:03.232 --> 23:06.150

23:06.185 --> 23:07.968
Ugh, why tonight, why?

to rebound from something

23:10.239 --> 23:11.489

-I'm so full.
-I know, me too.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.488
I know.
But I'm good.

27:21.524 --> 27:22.889
What can I get you?

27:22.908 --> 27:24.241
Nothing, it's just
the seventh charter.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.926
I'm just very tired.

27:25.961 --> 27:28.996
I strongly agree,
but I'm here.

27:29.031 --> 27:30.614
So chic.

27:30.666 --> 27:32.166
It smells like ass up here.

27:32.201 --> 27:33.567
Good morning, rayna.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.040
How'd you sleep?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.175
Well, and yourself?

27:41.210 --> 27:42.259
Out like a light.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.077
Sick.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.130
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

27:46.182 --> 27:48.432
Where is everybody?

27:48.467 --> 27:49.600
How you doing?
How'd you sleep?

27:49.635 --> 27:51.268
Feet hurt, my body hurts.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.271
I hurt so much, please don't
touch me, I might fall apart.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.422
Air hug!

27:55.458 --> 27:56.857
[phone rings]

27:56.892 --> 27:58.025
hello?

27:58.060 --> 27:58.692
<i> Hello, darling.</i>

27:58.728 --> 28:00.611
You are just having a break?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.029
I just woke up.

28:02.064 --> 28:03.564
I was thinking about you
this morning and I was like,

28:03.599 --> 28:05.232
this has been so amazing,

28:05.267 --> 28:07.100
I don't know I can come
back to the boat.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.135
This is...

28:08.170 --> 28:10.204
I mean, I'm a new person
after six weeks of this.

28:10.239 --> 28:12.456
I think I'm ready
for something new.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.659
I just feel so excited
for what's about to come,

28:15.711 --> 28:17.161
and I have no idea what that is,

28:17.213 --> 28:19.129
but that's given me
such a new lease of life.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.799
And, like, you just need to keep
moving on in life, don't you?

28:21.834 --> 28:25.886
My aspirations in yachting
are to become a chief stew.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.005
I think that it's a
really good challenge,

28:28.057 --> 28:30.808
and I could knock it out of the
park, given the opportunity.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.679
Sometimes things
are wonderful,

28:35.731 --> 28:37.431
but that's
just too comfortable,

28:37.466 --> 28:39.233
and I can't live a
comfortable life, you know?

28:43.155 --> 28:45.806
-Okay. Love you, darling.
<i> -Have the best day, okay?</i>

28:45.825 --> 28:47.241
Jake and rayna are
gonna be setting up today?

28:47.276 --> 28:48.275
Yeah.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.343
Six-person beach picnic?

28:49.378 --> 28:51.195
-Easy-peasy.
-Lemon squeezy.

28:51.247 --> 28:52.329
Hello, everyone.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.147
Hello, good morning.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.217
The special today is like
a mediterranean style shakshuka.

28:57.253 --> 28:59.119
I'd love to
try the shakshuka.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.343
Oh [bleep].

29:06.378 --> 29:07.878
The baked eggs are in.

29:07.930 --> 29:09.530
I'm, like... Literally like
five minutes out.

29:09.565 --> 29:11.098
Rachel said everything will
be up in the next five minutes,

29:11.133 --> 29:12.599
so if you'd like
to take a seat.

29:12.635 --> 29:14.802
Great.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.603
<i> Okay, rachel,</i>
<i> all guests have been seated.</i>

29:16.639 --> 29:18.338
Copy that, plating now.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.691
Today is gonna be a fun day.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.176
These are pretty.

29:22.211 --> 29:24.228
Yeah, in the middle.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.813
-Perfect.
-You don't like when it's runny?

29:28.534 --> 29:30.701
I'm trying.

29:30.736 --> 29:34.371
I'm, like, so grumpy and over
people being grumpy and over it.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.039
Oh.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.375
I think I can only handle people
being short with me so much.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.960
I'll happily carry the team,

29:39.995 --> 29:41.044
but, like, coming down
to where people are like,

29:41.080 --> 29:42.546
"I'm just ----ing exhausted."

29:42.581 --> 29:43.881
I'm like, "yeah, cool,
so am I."

29:43.916 --> 29:44.748
mm.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.500
The vibe on the
boat sucks right now,

29:46.535 --> 29:51.221
and I think the best way to fix
that is with imagination.

29:55.878 --> 29:57.394
Oh, my god, stunning.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.880
We need a serious bounce back.

29:59.915 --> 30:01.865
Let's take this
to the next level.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.589
And we have nothing over
14 knots today.

30:08.624 --> 30:09.923
Cool.

30:09.959 --> 30:11.842
Tomorrow, it drops
down to eight,

30:11.877 --> 30:14.678
and going into the dock,
you got nothing more than 12.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.130
-That's beautiful.
-Beautiful.

30:17.165 --> 30:18.932
So, they love
the musical "hamilton."

30:18.968 --> 30:21.168
-we're going to hamilton.
-Big fans.

30:21.203 --> 30:22.836
Get me a car.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.339
So, I'm trying to think of
a cool way to incorporate that.

30:25.374 --> 30:26.523
You already have an idea.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.008
What's on your ----ing mind?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.227
This is how we get
$30,000, are you ready?

30:31.397 --> 30:32.646
I hate you.

30:33.932 --> 30:36.283
So, they love the
musical "hamilton."

30:36.318 --> 30:38.836
so, I'm trying to think of
a cool way to incorporate that.

30:38.871 --> 30:42.823
You already have an idea.
What's on your ----ing mind?

30:42.875 --> 30:47.878
I am putting you in a colonial
alexander hamilton outfit.

30:49.715 --> 30:51.365
I can't sing the songs.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.616
You don't need to sing the song,
but you have to come out.

30:52.651 --> 30:54.735
-We're so quiet.
-I know.

30:54.787 --> 30:56.486
Definitely means it's good.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.121
Stephanie, why don't you make me
eggs like this in the morning?

30:59.925 --> 31:01.158
-I could pull up on the boat...
-Mm-hmm.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.577
Wearing the outfit and ask
for directions to new york city

31:03.629 --> 31:04.828
so I can better my education.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.213
And then leave
and be done with it.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.885
That's gone, that's gone,

31:11.921 --> 31:14.054
that's half gone,
this'll be gone.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.772
Hey, is there anything
you want us to do

31:15.808 --> 31:17.608
in preparation for the
beach that we'll take?

31:17.643 --> 31:19.276
Yeah, actually.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.645
Yeah, just the coconuts are
the most important right now.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.397
Just cut them in half.

31:23.432 --> 31:27.384
Is there a reason we're doing
this in my area of the boat?

31:27.403 --> 31:28.719
Yeah, better lighting
when he's...

31:28.754 --> 31:30.220
Oh, better lighting.

31:30.239 --> 31:31.888
I'm supposed to look
like alexander hamilton...

31:31.907 --> 31:33.407
-Eddie... Eddie...
-Not mrs. ----Ing doubtfire.

31:33.442 --> 31:36.726
I used to be really into musical
theater, back in the day.

31:36.745 --> 31:38.912
I think the first play I ever
was in was "wizard of oz."

31:38.948 --> 31:41.365
I was toto the dog.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.699
I stole the show.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.901
So, yeah, I have to play
it cool, but deep down,

31:44.920 --> 31:47.588
I can't wait to get
my alexander hamilton on.

31:47.623 --> 31:48.839
What the [bleep]?

31:48.874 --> 31:50.374
I look like a hobo.

31:52.678 --> 31:53.877
Mm-hmm.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.679
Okay, swimsuits right now.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.047
Yeah.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.799
Okay, deck crew, the bag
that's at the top

31:58.851 --> 32:00.851
of the crew mess stairs
is ready for the beach.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.308
I'm gonna go to
set up the beach,

32:08.360 --> 32:10.394
and you stay behind for
the final packing.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.761
Yeah, okay.

32:11.780 --> 32:13.947
Hi, I was just wondering
where you ladies were.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.066
Ugh.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.619
Hey!

32:18.654 --> 32:20.120
This is so much fun!

32:20.155 --> 32:22.322
I could go out for some
mimosas and water.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.208
Oh, this is pretty
cool, innit?

32:27.346 --> 32:29.479
Yeah, I love it.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.381
-Ready for some drinks?
-Yes.

32:35.721 --> 32:36.853
I know that
is very light.

32:36.889 --> 32:38.005
[bleep] off.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.423
-Mimosa time.
-Our hero!

32:39.458 --> 32:41.158
-I think that's it, right?
-Yeah.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.694
-Okay.
-All right, cheers.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.796
-Ladies.
-Thank you.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.631
Whew, the sand is hot.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.665
I told you.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.400
Yes, water, thank you.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.403
Got it?

32:56.241 --> 32:57.975
What the [bleep]
where's the pin?

32:58.010 --> 33:00.444
I can see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.113
Ooh, hot, hot, ah!

33:03.148 --> 33:05.415
But I'm most definitely
gonna miss jake,

33:05.451 --> 33:08.251
even though I hate jake
nine out of 10 times.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.486
[giggles]

33:09.505 --> 33:11.822
oh, these are placemats here.

33:11.857 --> 33:13.507
Oh, there's this thing as well.

33:13.542 --> 33:14.958
We genuinely love each other,

33:14.993 --> 33:16.510
but the boat's too small
for me and him.

33:16.545 --> 33:18.862
Our personalities are too big.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.230
[laughing]

33:20.265 --> 33:22.399
-oh, that'...
-What do you reckon?

33:22.434 --> 33:25.769
But regardless, sh--,
I love him.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.205
Bit small.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.439
[laughing]

33:31.193 --> 33:33.026
-how's it going?
-It's going fine.

33:33.062 --> 33:34.227
It'll be going even better
as soon as you get

33:34.279 --> 33:37.280
that sh--
out of my wheelhouse.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.148
Of course.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.183
That looks like
a costume shop up there.

33:40.202 --> 33:42.019
Of course, I will sort
that out right now.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.521
That means the wigs, the goblet,
the false sword...

33:44.556 --> 33:45.989
That's gotta go.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.691
I'll take care of
it right now.

33:48.711 --> 33:50.243
I don't know what's going
on with captain lee.

33:50.295 --> 33:52.996
I think he's a little tired
and cranky, too.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.414
That wig was pathetic.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.249
You're just pissed because
you wanna wear it,

33:56.301 --> 33:57.700
and you don't want us
to judge you.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.137
No, it looked like
a dead raccoon.

34:00.172 --> 34:03.423
Be honest with you,
it's funny as [bleep].

34:03.475 --> 34:05.058
Thank god he didn't
do that to me.

34:05.094 --> 34:06.576
I would have cried.

34:06.612 --> 34:07.844
What is my crew coming to?

34:07.879 --> 34:09.312
I'm not eating
anyone this season.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.565
Yeah, well,
there's still time.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.016
There is, there is.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.687
Yeah.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.789
Does anyone need top-ups?

34:18.824 --> 34:20.057
Yeah, I'll take another one.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.324
You'll take another
one, fantastic.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.359
Anyone else?

34:22.394 --> 34:23.910
Fraser, I'm just gonna
steal kaylee real quick.

34:23.946 --> 34:25.579
Can you handle front of house?

34:25.614 --> 34:27.531
<i> Yeah, I've just taken</i>
<i> a drinks order, all good.</i>

34:27.566 --> 34:28.899
Copy.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.584
Can I just have a splash of
orange juice?

34:30.619 --> 34:32.002
Of course you can.

34:33.939 --> 34:35.255
From who?

34:35.290 --> 34:36.790
Just, like, it started
with rachel just being,

34:36.842 --> 34:39.593
like, snippy, and ----ing
rayna giving me attitude,

34:39.628 --> 34:42.129
and I had all the ----ing
hamilton sh-- in the bridge

34:42.181 --> 34:45.132
and captain lee was just
like, "get this out."

34:45.184 --> 34:46.916
you know, it's just like
I feel like everyone, like...

34:46.935 --> 34:49.136
Everyone just leave me
the [bleep] alone.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.773
Heather and I's relationship
is like a sister relationship.

34:52.808 --> 34:54.357
We support each other.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.092
We also wanna rip each
other's heads off at some point.

34:56.111 --> 34:58.145
Like, it's fun until
people make me feel like,

34:58.197 --> 35:00.814
you know, stupid for caring,
you know?

35:00.866 --> 35:02.616
But it sucks to see
heather like this.

35:02.651 --> 35:05.318
Normally she's positive,
she's happy all the time.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.621
So, I feel like
it's almost my responsibility

35:07.656 --> 35:10.607
to pick her back up, because
that's what sisters do.

35:10.626 --> 35:13.877
Everything is handled,
the guests are happy.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.412
Right, that's all
that matters.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.450
How's it going?

35:20.486 --> 35:22.919
Usually better
than you're doing.

35:22.955 --> 35:25.222
Have to tie it
all down for the beach.

35:29.144 --> 35:31.661
I'll come do that now for you.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.980
Tell me you're not chewing gum.

35:34.016 --> 35:36.016
I'll spit it out before I guess
to the guests, of course.

35:36.068 --> 35:38.018
-Thank you.
-Ugh. God.

35:38.070 --> 35:41.488
Still standing, more knives.
Throw 'em my way, let's go.

35:41.523 --> 35:43.306
Fraser, if you just wanna
handle the guests,

35:43.325 --> 35:44.524
I'll bring the lunch down.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.076
<i> Copy that.</i>

35:48.080 --> 35:49.513
I'll take this one down.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.380
Yeah, use a rag.

35:50.415 --> 35:51.948
Let me know if
it's too, too hot.

35:54.336 --> 35:56.870
Just done a full check
of the guests.

35:56.922 --> 35:57.871
They're all right.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.422
How you doing fraser?

35:59.458 --> 36:00.674
I'm very well, thank you,
how are you, good sir?

36:00.709 --> 36:02.876
Why are you down here, fraser?

36:02.928 --> 36:04.344
Three stews in the crew mess,

36:04.379 --> 36:07.047
captain lee's big no-no
we just talked about.

36:07.099 --> 36:10.217
Like, it is literally one
thing after another.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.401
I'll go to front of house.

36:11.436 --> 36:12.719
Okay.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.538
Kaylee, once you're done eating,
just get prepped for the beach.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.007
-Nope.
-I think we're good.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.309
-I think we're good.
-Okay.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.912
Fraser, why don't you come
out here real quick?

36:21.947 --> 36:23.446
After the conversation
captain lee

36:23.482 --> 36:25.649
had with me yesterday
about all three of us

36:25.684 --> 36:26.650
being in the crew mess...

36:26.685 --> 36:28.084
Sure, and then he was there.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.419
That's the only reason
why I was like,

36:29.454 --> 36:32.405
"don't bring the food down,
I got it."

36:32.457 --> 36:34.374
so, the fact that you said
"copy" and then still

36:34.409 --> 36:35.909
did the opposite of what I said,

36:35.961 --> 36:40.029
and it makes it look like
my word doesn't stand.

36:40.048 --> 36:42.065
Yeah.
I'm not seeing that.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.967
-Yeah.
-I'm seeing being helpful.

36:44.002 --> 36:45.702
But the radio call said don't
grab it; you still grabbed it.

36:45.737 --> 36:46.903
-Yeah.
-I would have...

36:46.939 --> 36:48.305
-You just, like...
-Copy, got it.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.573
If I were you, I would have
just ran upstairs

36:49.608 --> 36:50.941
-and gotten something else.
-Copy.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.058
Pretended like you
were too busy...

36:52.094 --> 36:53.343
-Yeah.
-With something else.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.594
Yeah.
I haven't got time for this.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.612
-You know?
-Yeah.

36:55.647 --> 36:56.730
Okay.

36:56.765 --> 36:58.281
I'm sorry, heather, that
you're not feeling great,

36:58.317 --> 37:00.984
but right now, it's not cute.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.309
Ah, no!

37:09.361 --> 37:10.644
Did it go overboard?

37:10.696 --> 37:12.646
All right, we'll take
a stern line.

37:12.698 --> 37:13.530
Copy.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.098
-Got it!
-But we know you'd get it.

37:15.117 --> 37:16.199
Clear.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.450
Wes, wes, rachel.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.818
Can you meet me in the galley?

37:21.039 --> 37:22.155
They're coming.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.377
Yeah.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.213
After last night, screwing
up twice, not an option.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.815
Put all the...
Everything in here.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.784
This jungle theme menu
is brought you know,

37:34.803 --> 37:36.452
by [bleep]-ton a la carte.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.389
The only problem is is are
these double-stacked... Yeah.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.308
Everyone has
a ----ing option.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.262
Don't worry about it,
I'll clean it up...

37:45.297 --> 37:46.529
Gonna go put my makeup on.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.365
I look forward to
seeing the full outcome.

37:51.436 --> 37:55.739
I'm sweating like a b-I-t-c-h.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.240
Are you doing anything?

37:57.276 --> 37:59.342
Well, what, I was just
slowly letting go

37:59.378 --> 38:01.344
to see if it was really
helping you or not.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.846
Primaries are ready.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.030
I can take them right now,
if they'd like that.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.248
-Really?
-Yeah.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.416
You wanna bust out
the silverware

38:06.451 --> 38:07.617
that's in there, kaylee?

38:07.653 --> 38:09.152
This beach picnic has
to be seamless,

38:09.171 --> 38:11.621
so I need to get my head
into the game

38:11.656 --> 38:14.024
and stop worrying about how
everyone else feels.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.209
I'm just gonna kinda
throw my penny in the water

38:16.261 --> 38:18.061
and wish for the best.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.046
Please.

38:20.098 --> 38:21.131
Help me.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.632
<i> The guests are coming over now,</i>

38:22.667 --> 38:23.850
and then I'll come back,
pick up rachel.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.035
<i> Copy that, thank you.</i>

38:25.070 --> 38:26.102
You girls look great.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.270
Aw, thank you.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.389
-Watch your head.
-Ooh.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.857
That's not a great angle
of me, honey.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.392
There's a little thought
into this, I'm sorry.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.727
-Is there?
-Am I staying for service, then?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.445
I'm gonna send you
back to the boat.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.030
Check all the guest cabins
and then go into laundry.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.231
Yeah.

38:38.283 --> 38:40.283
Look how cute it is!
Oh, my gosh!

38:40.319 --> 38:42.852
Welcome to your jungle paradise.

38:42.888 --> 38:43.853
Cute!

38:43.889 --> 38:45.322
We have our monkeys back!

38:45.357 --> 38:47.657
You guys are the cutest ever.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.591
All set.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.560
You've got it, you've
just gotta jump.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.896
I can't push you there.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.698
Yeah, that was really
graceful, nice job.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.903
What's our drink of the day?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.771
We have a passion
fruit pineapple punch.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.140
You could do it with
vodka or rum or gin.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.642
Vodka.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.077
I'll do it with rum,
I'm in the islands.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.645
Yeah, let's do it.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.313
We're ready to roll.
Thank you, wes, for your help.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.514
You're good, mate.

39:11.549 --> 39:13.350
Good, stern's away.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.487
Oh, shoot, practice...
Glad that was practice.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.888
-High-five.
-Roger.

39:18.907 --> 39:20.490
-Oops.
-You ordered vodka?

39:20.525 --> 39:21.691
-Rum.
-Here.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.426
Thank you.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.628
Oh, these are...
Heh, these are dangerous.

39:25.664 --> 39:26.696
Yeah.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.398
They taste like literal juice.

39:28.433 --> 39:29.833
Dangerously yum.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.787
I think the drive-by
is a cute idea.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.105
I could dress up
for the ice cream run.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.406
I think that'd be great.

39:36.441 --> 39:37.841
-Where's the grill?
-Right there.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.126
Oh, jesus, that scared
the ----ing sh-- outta me.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.379
One, two, three.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.797
Suck it in.

39:43.849 --> 39:44.948
-How you guys doing?
-I'm ready to roll.

39:44.983 --> 39:45.949
Cool.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.384
-Lunch is ready.
-Oh!

39:47.419 --> 39:48.852
Whenever you wanna sit.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.354
-Wagyu, sunburn; wagyu, sunburn.
-Chairs up a little bit.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.390
Let's go ahead and do
this first, conch salad,

39:53.425 --> 39:54.824
but we'll hold
this one last

39:54.860 --> 39:56.476
because the primary
doesn't like lobster.

39:56.528 --> 39:57.644
-Okay, perfect.
-Cool.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.229
I may look fancy,
but deep down...

39:59.264 --> 40:00.563
You've got me.

40:00.599 --> 40:01.731
-Just a midwestern girl.
-I'm a farm girl.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.316
Story of my life, right here.

40:03.368 --> 40:04.868
It's the story of my life,
right here.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.505
Would you care for
a conch salad?

40:08.540 --> 40:10.206
Oh, look how cute,
in the coconuts.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.875
I like that.

40:11.910 --> 40:12.742
-For you, madam?
-Yes.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.577
And the steak's
gonna go right now.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.546
Oh, the flavor
is amazing, though.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.882
Oh, my god, it's
like she read our minds.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.950
Or our preference sheet,
one of the two.

40:20.969 --> 40:22.285
How's the wagyu cooked?

40:22.304 --> 40:24.554
I'd like to say perfect.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.555
All right, I'm gonna need
to let eddie know

40:25.590 --> 40:26.923
to change into his costume.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.993
<i> Eddie, eddie, heather.</i>

40:30.028 --> 40:31.294
-Yeah, that's what he's gonna...
-Awesome.

40:31.329 --> 40:32.495
<i> Yeah, go ahead, heather.</i>

40:32.531 --> 40:33.980
Do you wanna get changed
into costume

40:34.015 --> 40:37.000
and bring the ice cream in
the next 10 to 15 minutes?

40:37.035 --> 40:38.535
Yeah, copy that.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.375
I'm alexander hamilton, bitch.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.012
-Let's go.
-Okay.

40:49.047 --> 40:51.681
Alexander hamilton
don't give a [bleep].

40:51.716 --> 40:53.216
You know you're
in your forties

40:53.251 --> 40:56.019
when you have a lot
of leopard print.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.221
That's it?

40:58.256 --> 40:59.589
You're not in your forties.

40:59.624 --> 41:02.459
I'm alexander hamilton!

41:02.494 --> 41:03.676
I love it.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.528
I'm on my way to new york.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.465
You're gonna wanna get
your camera for this one.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.600
Hey!
It's alexander hamilton!

41:10.635 --> 41:13.019
Ah!

41:13.054 --> 41:15.338
It's 1761, I'm on my
way to new york

41:15.373 --> 41:16.673
to go to king's college.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.274
But I brought you ice cream.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.809
[laughing]

41:21.746 --> 41:26.316
yay!

41:26.351 --> 41:28.351
Alexander hamilton!

41:28.386 --> 41:30.954
-Woo!
-Wish me luck in columbia!

41:30.989 --> 41:32.188
We love you!

41:32.224 --> 41:35.191
Lin manuel, what's up?
I'm available.

41:35.210 --> 41:36.593
That was amazing.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.220
[bleep] why is this
happening right now?

41:47.255 --> 41:49.389
If this sh-- melts, then
it looks like I'm a dumbass.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.423
-What's up?
-This is ice cream.

41:50.475 --> 41:51.708
Yeah.

41:51.743 --> 41:52.909
The guests haven't
finished eating.

41:52.944 --> 41:53.843
It's gonna melt.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.728
You the one who said
to have it be sent.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.063
No, no, not now, I said
when they're ready to eat,

41:57.098 --> 41:58.064
have it sent.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.482
You said 10...

41:59.518 --> 42:00.483
I wanted the guests
to be done eating

42:00.519 --> 42:01.618
and run the ice cream separate,

42:01.653 --> 42:02.885
not necessary
with a costume.

42:02.904 --> 42:04.320
You said 10 minutes,
and we made the...

42:04.356 --> 42:05.522
I made the call right in
front of you.

42:05.557 --> 42:07.023
Am I in the twilight zone?

42:07.058 --> 42:08.074
What did I do wrong here?

42:08.109 --> 42:09.592
I gave you want you wanted.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.077
Don't hate me for that.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.897
We can keep it inside
of the cooler with ice.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.532
That's fine.
I don't care anymore.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.083
Seriously.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.035
Let me fix this, because,
like, this is gonna melt.

42:23.341 --> 42:24.274
I live for this sh--

42:24.309 --> 42:25.942
ah!

42:25.977 --> 42:28.945
The season finale
of "below deck."

42:28.980 --> 42:29.946
-bang!
-Ah!

42:29.981 --> 42:31.030
[screaming]

42:31.066 --> 42:33.483
no!

42:33.518 --> 42:34.817
Still wanna take it to the dock?

42:34.852 --> 42:36.319
All right, deck crew,
we're headed in.

42:36.354 --> 42:37.687
You're doing the driving.

42:37.706 --> 42:39.489
Why do I feel like
I'm about to give birth?

42:39.524 --> 42:41.024
I don't know, cap.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.408
How are you, what do you need,
what can I get you?

42:42.460 --> 42:43.993
Nothing.
Good christ.

42:44.029 --> 42:47.330
I'm busy as [bleep]
so I might feed on your soul.

42:47.365 --> 42:48.598
We're still
gonna cloche, right?

42:48.633 --> 42:50.366
Damn it.
Shut the [bleep] up.

42:50.385 --> 42:52.969
It's not the time, bitch.
It doesn't have time for this.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.438
I am on my knees,
asking for forgiveness.

42:57.092 --> 42:59.842
Oh, sh--.
