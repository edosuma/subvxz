WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.416
I gotta get goin'

00:03.416 --> 00:07.000
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.083 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:20.958
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.125
we're so adventurous

00:28.125 --> 00:31.250
and again

00:31.250 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:38.333
to count on a friend

00:38.333 --> 00:41.875
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.875 --> 00:45.375
take me, please?

00:45.375 --> 00:48.750
I got to be there

00:50.750 --> 00:56.000
Winnie the Pooh

01:12.833 --> 01:15.208
Tigger,
that's too much corn.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.458
And you're holding it
too close to the heat.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.625
Relax, bunny boy.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.625
Popping corn is one of
the things tiggers do best.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.708
I knew you put too much
corn in that popper.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.458
Oh, fiddlesticks.

01:35.458 --> 01:38.375
You just grew too much
pop in your corn.

01:38.375 --> 01:42.083
I say we toast marshmallows.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.208
They're less noisy,

01:44.208 --> 01:47.458
and I'm full
of that fluffy stuff.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.708
In that case,
how about some honey?

01:49.708 --> 01:51.583
It's very unnoisy, too.

01:54.708 --> 01:58.875
Oh, bother.
It's all so very unfull.

02:00.333 --> 02:04.208
Have you ever heard
of a honey-moon, Piglet?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.500
It does sound
familiar, Pooh.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.625
B-But tell me
the story anyway.

02:08.625 --> 02:14.291
Yeah, a ghost story
loaded with spookables.

02:14.291 --> 02:15.375
Yipe!

02:15.375 --> 02:16.708
G-G-Ghost story?

02:16.708 --> 02:18.958
This spooky spine tingler

02:18.958 --> 02:21.583
is about the grab-me gotcha,

02:21.583 --> 02:23.583
a shadowy shiftaroo

02:23.583 --> 02:26.583
who loves to grab
any shivering stranger

02:26.583 --> 02:29.416
in his creepy-clawed crushes

02:29.416 --> 02:32.583
right before he goes...

02:32.583 --> 02:33.583
gotcha!

02:36.291 --> 02:38.125
Oh, well.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.416
I guess that's why he's
called a grab-me gotcha

02:40.416 --> 02:42.250
instead of a please excuse me.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.625
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

02:44.625 --> 02:46.333
Pleasant dreams.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.875
TTFN.

02:47.875 --> 02:51.083
Hmm. You didn't frighten me.

02:51.083 --> 02:54.750
I know there's no such thing
as a grab-me gotcha.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.458
Aah! It's in my sleeping bag!

02:57.458 --> 03:00.958
H-Have you noticed
how dark and spooky
it is out here

03:00.958 --> 03:02.583
all of a sudden?

03:02.583 --> 03:05.333
Uh, take it from me, Piglet,

03:05.333 --> 03:07.708
there is no
grab-me gotcha monster.

03:07.708 --> 03:09.458
Now go along to bed.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.875
Excuse me, Piglet,

03:11.875 --> 03:15.000
but that's not your
sleeping bag.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.083
Is it?

03:16.083 --> 03:17.958
Heh. Someone should stay up

03:17.958 --> 03:19.875
and protect the corn
from grab-me gotchas,

03:19.875 --> 03:21.083
don't you think?

03:21.083 --> 03:23.416
That's very kind
of you, Piglet.

03:23.416 --> 03:26.000
While you look
after the corn,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
would you mind if I
looked after you?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.833
Not at all, Pooh.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.458
You know, moon,

03:31.458 --> 03:33.000
you look as if
you would fit

03:33.000 --> 03:34.958
right here
in my honey pot.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.333
Do you think

03:37.333 --> 03:39.291
the moon has honey
on it, Piglet?

03:39.291 --> 03:40.875
All I know, Pooh,

03:40.875 --> 03:45.000
is that it seems an awfully
long way from home.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.625
Yes. It's so very high.

03:48.625 --> 03:52.375
I'd have to stay up for
a long time to get there.

03:54.625 --> 03:59.166
And I'm too sleepy
to stay up any longer.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.458
Night, Pooh.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.875
Good night, Piglet.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.875
What's that, Pooh?

04:14.583 --> 04:17.708
- Yaah!
- Yipe!

04:29.000 --> 04:30.333
What is all this?

04:30.333 --> 04:33.708
Keep your lip
buttoned, buster.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.583
The grab-me gotcha got
Piglet and old Pooh boy.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.625
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've--

04:39.625 --> 04:41.250
Shh!
Shh!

04:41.250 --> 04:43.458
If we're going to save
fluff boy and Piglet

04:43.458 --> 04:45.166
from the spookable,

04:45.166 --> 04:48.083
we have to be quiet
so he doesn't grab us, too.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.166
But I tell you there's no--

04:50.166 --> 04:51.291
Shh!

04:53.458 --> 04:55.000
I have a feeling

04:55.000 --> 04:57.875
this is going to be
a long night.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.125
Where are we, Pooh?

05:05.500 --> 05:10.375
Oh, my. Why, we've been
popped to the moon.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.583
The honey-moon!

05:13.958 --> 05:15.875
I wish I'd brought
a larger pot

05:15.875 --> 05:18.416
for all the moon honey
I'm going to take back.

05:18.416 --> 05:21.875
Uh, Pooh, the moon always
fades away at dawn.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.750
I think something faded away

05:23.750 --> 05:26.833
would be awfully difficult
to stand on. Don't you?

05:26.833 --> 05:30.000
That's a good question,
Piglet.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.875
Then we'd better hurry and
find some of that moon honey.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.500
I'll betcha my stripes

05:36.500 --> 05:38.208
I can spot
Pooh and Piglet

05:38.208 --> 05:40.125
from the tippy-top
of this tree.

05:41.583 --> 05:44.250
I wish Tigger
would wipe his feet

05:44.250 --> 05:45.708
before he bounces.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.000
And what do you think
you're doing?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.125
Mm, you just gave me an idea.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.333
We should camouflage ourselves

05:54.333 --> 05:56.458
so the monster can't find us.

05:58.583 --> 06:02.083
Hmm. I can't see hide
nor seek of them.

06:02.083 --> 06:06.000
Say, what if old scary-face
sees me first?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.875
Well, you can't scare
what you can't find.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.000
He won't find a tigger
for the trees.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.250
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

06:15.208 --> 06:16.375
Aah!

06:18.250 --> 06:23.166
Yuck! Them grab-me gotchas
out-uglied me by a mile.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.708
A giant moon bee!

06:33.708 --> 06:35.500
Oh, d-d-dear.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.458
I don't care what you say.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.750
There are no grab-me gotchas.

06:39.750 --> 06:43.208
But-- But you saw him
with your own eyes.

06:43.208 --> 06:46.000
We got to get out
of here, by dinghy.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.416
There's nothing that's
going to make me budge
from this spot

06:49.416 --> 06:50.750
until morning.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.833
Grab-me gotchas, indeed.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.708
Gopher, don't--

06:57.375 --> 07:00.416
The moon must be
a very scary place

07:00.416 --> 07:02.458
for someone
to be scared of me.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.375
What now, Pooh?

07:04.375 --> 07:07.583
I think, Piglet,
from now on,

07:07.583 --> 07:11.708
we're going to have
to be very, very

07:11.708 --> 07:17.000
careful!

07:18.375 --> 07:21.875
Oh, my. Where are we now?

07:23.375 --> 07:24.625
We must be inside

07:24.625 --> 07:27.208
a giant moon bee honeycomb.

07:27.208 --> 07:29.458
And where there's honeycombs,

07:29.458 --> 07:32.708
there's bound to be--
-- moon honey.

07:32.708 --> 07:36.333
I just hope there aren't
any more giant bees.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.250
Well, how did I know

07:41.250 --> 07:43.291
you was going to disguise
yourselves, too?

07:43.291 --> 07:45.708
I told you
there was no monster.

07:45.708 --> 07:48.375
It was just us
scaring ourselves silly.

07:48.375 --> 07:51.458
Oh, yeah? Then where
are Pooh and Piglet?

07:51.458 --> 07:53.708
- Pooh: Yoo-hoo!
- Yaah!

07:53.708 --> 07:56.208
Moon honey!

07:56.208 --> 07:59.000
Where are you?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.500
Who goes there?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.583
Listen, Piglet.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.291
That must be
the honey calling.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.750
Who goes here?

08:08.750 --> 08:10.166
Goodness gracious!

08:10.166 --> 08:11.875
It's the grab-me gotcha!

08:11.875 --> 08:15.166
Tell us where you are!

08:15.166 --> 08:16.708
I'm very ready

08:16.708 --> 08:20.291
for a large smackerel
of something.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.291
It talks like Pooh.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.250
Of course
it sounds like Pooh.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.958
You are what you
grab, you know.

08:25.958 --> 08:30.708
And now it wants us. Yaah!

08:30.708 --> 08:34.875
Uh, perhaps we should
retreat and think this over.

08:34.875 --> 08:38.000
Never mind the retreats!
Let's get out of here!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.458
Yaah!

08:39.458 --> 08:42.458
That honey doesn't sound
very friendly, Pooh.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.583
I think you're right, Piglet.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.583
It is time to go home.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.875
But how do we go home before
the moon fades away, Pooh?

08:49.875 --> 08:52.208
It seems to me

08:52.208 --> 08:55.458
that, since we had to go
very up to get here,

08:55.458 --> 08:58.958
we're going to have to go
very down to get home.

08:58.958 --> 09:00.833
But we are down, Pooh.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.083
But now down enough.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.875
What we need is a falling
start.

09:05.875 --> 09:08.291
We simply have to go up.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.125
Come along, Piglet.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.958
We're going home.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.000
Up? Down?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.375
Oh, dear.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.333
I will admit

09:18.333 --> 09:20.458
there is something
strange going on,

09:20.458 --> 09:23.833
but so far, the only monsters
I've seen are you two.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.833
Just remember, long ears,

09:25.833 --> 09:27.833
it's always darkest
before the lawn.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.125
Besides, we've got
one thing on our side

09:30.125 --> 09:31.708
that the other joker's
missing.

09:31.708 --> 09:32.750
What's that?

09:32.750 --> 09:35.416
Me! And I got a foolproof plan

09:35.416 --> 09:36.875
for saving our buddies.

09:38.166 --> 09:40.333
With this sort
of falling start,

09:40.333 --> 09:43.083
we'll be down
and home in no time.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.583
- Oh, here comes the sun.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.708
Get ready to fall.

09:48.708 --> 09:51.000
That's
an awfully tall down

09:51.000 --> 09:53.416
for such a very
small animal.

09:53.416 --> 09:57.250
Hmm. Piglet, you're right.

09:57.250 --> 10:01.875
And I, uh, wouldn't want
to fall without you.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.166
- Pooh, does the moon make

10:04.166 --> 10:06.875
a sort of crinkly crackly
sound when it fades?

10:06.875 --> 10:09.208
Why do you ask, Piglet?

10:09.208 --> 10:12.875
Both: Aah!

10:15.875 --> 10:17.583
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

10:17.583 --> 10:20.125
We'll scare the pants off
the first grab-me gotcha

10:20.125 --> 10:21.166
that walks in there.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.708
For the last time,

10:22.708 --> 10:24.500
you're not going
to catch anything

10:24.500 --> 10:26.000
- in that ridiculous trap
-

10:26.000 --> 10:27.708
because there is
no such thing

10:27.708 --> 10:29.125
as a grab-me gotcha.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.208
- Yaah!

10:30.208 --> 10:33.000
Help! Don't let it grab me!

10:35.416 --> 10:37.750
Ha! Scaredy cat.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.708
Oh, Pooh, it worked.
We're home.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.458
Yes. And being home
from the moon

10:43.458 --> 10:46.250
is just as sweet
as the honey
we didn't get--

10:46.250 --> 10:48.291
-- almost.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.583
What did you guys
do with the monster?

10:50.583 --> 10:53.708
Why, we left them
all on the moon.

10:53.708 --> 10:58.166
Say, what's
all this moon talk?

10:58.166 --> 11:00.875
Weren't you grabbed
by the grab-me gotcha?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.750
Uh, no,

11:02.750 --> 11:07.875
but we were chased
by all sorts of ugly
moon creatures.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.875
Yes. There was this
horrible little one

11:09.875 --> 11:11.625
with great big teeth

11:11.625 --> 11:13.166
and a great-big
tall one

11:13.166 --> 11:14.750
with feelers coming
out of his head

11:14.750 --> 11:16.416
that looked
like rabbit ears.

11:16.416 --> 11:19.583
But the worst were
the giant bouncing bees

11:19.583 --> 11:21.958
with stripes and
beady little eyes.

11:21.958 --> 11:25.750
Oh, Tigger, I can't tell you
how glad I am to be home.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.416
Bouncing beady-eyed bees?

11:28.416 --> 11:31.583
Uh, nah. I couldn't be.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.166
Oh, d-d-dear.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.333
Gotcha. Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:48.958 --> 11:51.291
Ah, do you know what happens

11:51.291 --> 11:54.500
in just one more day,
Pooh Bear?

11:54.500 --> 11:58.166
Yes, Rabbit. I believe
tomorrow happens.

11:58.166 --> 12:01.458
Or is it the day
after yesterday?

12:01.458 --> 12:04.375
No. That's today.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.750
I think.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.625
No, Pooh Bear.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.833
It's the most wonderful
day of the year.

12:10.833 --> 12:14.208
The day I harvest my garden.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.833
Ah, the flawless vegetables

12:16.833 --> 12:18.833
at the peak
of their tastiness.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.500
Can you hear them?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.208
The beautiful crops

12:22.208 --> 12:24.333
calling out
to be harvested.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.875
I believe I hear my stomach

12:26.875 --> 12:29.333
calling out for honey.

12:29.333 --> 12:34.166
And that lovely day
is almost here.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.250
Perhaps I might help you
harvest, Rabbit?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.708
No, Pooh Bear.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.250
I could never trust
anyone else with that.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.708
Why, uh,
I hardly trust myself.

13:00.708 --> 13:03.583
And I could certainly
never trust it to those--

13:03.583 --> 13:05.333
- crows!
-

13:05.333 --> 13:08.458
Quickly, Pooh Bear!
My broom!

13:09.875 --> 13:11.166
Trespassers!

13:11.166 --> 13:13.708
I'll make feather
dusters of you all!

13:13.708 --> 13:15.583
No, no! The broom!

13:15.583 --> 13:18.875
If there's one thing
I hate more than a crow,

13:18.875 --> 13:20.708
it's four crows!

13:23.416 --> 13:27.000
Rabbit, I believe
I've found your--

13:27.000 --> 13:29.083
Oh, bother.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.875
I must keep
those beasts away

13:37.875 --> 13:41.083
until after the harvest.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.708
Your broom, Rabbit.

13:45.458 --> 13:50.000
Thank you. And I can see
I'm going to need help.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.166
The purpose
of this drill

13:52.166 --> 13:55.166
is to get you familiar with
the enemy we are facing:

13:55.166 --> 13:57.708
the filthiest, trickiest,

13:57.708 --> 14:00.625
most evil creature
there is.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.458
Oh, dear.

14:02.458 --> 14:06.833
I give you the greatest threat
a gardener has ever faced:

14:06.833 --> 14:08.583
the crow.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.125
Hmm. That's funny.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.750
When the light hits him
a certain way,

14:11.750 --> 14:13.583
he kind of resembles
Pooh boy.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.000
Don't tell anyone,
Tigger,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.833
- but actually I'm me.
- Pooh Bear!

14:20.458 --> 14:23.291
I forgot.

14:23.291 --> 14:24.458
Ahem.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.583
Caw.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.000
Notice the beak:

14:27.000 --> 14:29.583
perfectly designed
for stealing my corn,

14:29.583 --> 14:31.958
the claws for
clutching tomatoes.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.208
Say, buddy boy, this will do
if there's just one crow,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.125
but what if there's
a gazillion of them?

14:37.125 --> 14:39.500
I'm glad you asked, Tigger,

14:39.500 --> 14:41.250
because that's
when we'll bring in

14:41.250 --> 14:43.208
reinforcements of our own.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.958
The crows will see these,

14:44.958 --> 14:46.958
think we've
doubled our number,

14:46.958 --> 14:48.708
and run for their lives.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.375
Now, then, Pooh Bear will
try to steal vegetables,

14:52.375 --> 14:54.458
and I'll show the proper
way to catch him.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.208
Watch very closely

14:56.208 --> 14:58.000
and do just as I do.

14:59.708 --> 15:02.000
Caw. Bother.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.958
Pooh Bear, will you come
back here so I can--

15:18.583 --> 15:19.750
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

15:22.958 --> 15:24.083
Ow! Ooh!

15:24.083 --> 15:25.458
Ow. Ooh.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.500
Look, guys. No feet.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.208
Crow! Follow that crow!

15:35.500 --> 15:37.416
Tigger! You stay here

15:37.416 --> 15:39.708
and guard the garden
with your life!

15:39.708 --> 15:41.708
But, long ears,
since I'm a tigger,

15:41.708 --> 15:43.416
and tiggers never get lost,

15:43.416 --> 15:45.708
following crows
is what we do best.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.416
Um, uh, Rabbit--

15:47.416 --> 15:48.583
You're right, Tigger.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.708
Uh, Piglet, you stand guard.

15:50.708 --> 15:53.500
Uh, but, Rabbit, I'm just
a very small animal,

15:53.500 --> 15:56.458
and they're
such very large crows.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.875
Rabbit,
I'd be glad to--

15:58.875 --> 16:01.000
Uh, you have a point, Piglet.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.458
I'll be glad
to help, Rabbit.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.458
I suppose there's no choice.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.875
Just stand here, Pooh Bear,

16:07.875 --> 16:09.708
and wait until help arrives.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.083
After that crow!

16:20.208 --> 16:22.083
Caw?

16:22.083 --> 16:23.375
- Ow!

16:23.375 --> 16:24.375
- Ow!

16:24.375 --> 16:25.458
- Oh!

16:29.291 --> 16:32.000
We're either following
a crow or a leaky pillow.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.583
Oh, I do hope Pooh is taking
good care of my garden.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.083
Don't worry, Rabbit.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.500
I'm sure everything
will be just fine.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.083
I hope.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.458
I wonder if that's the plants

16:56.458 --> 16:58.583
calling out to be harvested.

17:02.583 --> 17:05.833
Why, hello.
And who are you?

17:05.833 --> 17:09.083
Don't tell me. Are you...

17:09.083 --> 17:10.458
tomatoes?

17:10.458 --> 17:12.833
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.208
Yeah.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.375
But I never knew
tomatoes talked.

17:17.375 --> 17:21.000
You're not crows,
are you?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.500
No, no, no, no, no.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.291
Why, no.
You couldn't be crows

17:25.291 --> 17:29.625
because crows look like me,
which you do not.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.958
Ah. You must be the help
Rabbit said would arrive.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.833
Uh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, uh-huh.

17:37.833 --> 17:41.000
How do you do?
I'm Pooh.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.375
Have you...flown in
from the north?

17:44.375 --> 17:45.458
Yeah.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.500
But you couldn't be penguins.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.625
You're a much warmer color,

17:51.625 --> 17:53.208
I think.

17:53.208 --> 17:56.125
Perhaps you're from the south?

17:56.125 --> 17:58.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.375
Keep your eyes peeled
for a bald bird.

18:52.375 --> 18:53.416
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

18:55.291 --> 18:58.000
Oh, dear.
I wonder where we are.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.875
Since you're the tigger
who never gets lost,

19:00.875 --> 19:03.083
perhaps you could tell us
just where we are.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.500
That's easy, bunny boy.
We're right here.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.583
And where is right here?

19:07.583 --> 19:09.708
Just a little northwest
of over there,

19:09.708 --> 19:11.125
which isn't lost.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.708
If we go much farther,

19:12.708 --> 19:15.125
we won't be back
for harvest time.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.958
Oh, I hope that bear hasn't let
anything happen to my garden.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.583
Oh. Another guest.

19:38.583 --> 19:41.833
Is this going to be
a feat for friends?

19:41.833 --> 19:44.833
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.708
Perhaps I should get
Rabbit and the others.

19:52.416 --> 19:54.083
But don't you
want them to see

19:54.083 --> 19:56.625
what a fine job we've
done with the harvest?

19:56.625 --> 19:57.708
Ahh.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.875
I wish my friends were here

19:59.875 --> 20:01.458
to enjoy the party.

20:01.458 --> 20:05.583
Why, I know a way
they can be here...

20:05.583 --> 20:07.208
in a way.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.000
Piglet: We've walked
a very great distance

20:11.000 --> 20:13.166
and found very few crows.

20:13.166 --> 20:16.291
Rabbit: And it was nothing
but a wild goose chase.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.583
Tigger: Wild geeses? I thought
we were looking for crows.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.375
Pooh: Surprise!

20:32.000 --> 20:35.208
I wonder where they're off to
in such a hurry.

20:35.208 --> 20:39.583
I suppose they must
be late for their trip south.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.208
- Oh, d-d-dear.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.416
I think I hear something.

20:48.416 --> 20:50.458
Well, whatever it is,

20:50.458 --> 20:52.000
you can be sure it's not--

20:53.083 --> 20:54.750
Crows!

20:59.708 --> 21:01.166
Ruined!

21:01.166 --> 21:02.833
My beautiful garden!

21:02.833 --> 21:06.708
A year's work gone,
destroyed!

21:06.708 --> 21:08.375
Why did I ever leave

21:08.375 --> 21:11.500
that fumbling, bumbling
bear to guard it?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
Uh, bad judgment?

21:20.875 --> 21:23.875
Pooh Bear! I can't
believe that you--

21:23.875 --> 21:28.083
you-- you harvested my garden.

21:28.083 --> 21:30.166
You did all this,
buddy bear?

21:30.166 --> 21:32.583
- By yourself?
- In such a short time?

21:32.583 --> 21:36.083
Welcome to the Feast
For Friends feast.

21:36.083 --> 21:41.208
Why, Pooh Bear, I--
I don't know what to say.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.958
You don't have to say
a thing, Rabbit.

21:43.958 --> 21:46.750
I was glad to help.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.375
Uh, but how, Pooh?

21:49.375 --> 21:51.583
How did you
possibly do it?

21:51.583 --> 21:53.708
Well, it was very
simple, really.

21:53.708 --> 21:57.291
I just took a carrot here,
a turnip there,

22:48.875 --> 22:52.416
Winnie the Pooh Bear

22:54.458 --> 22:55.875
take me, please?

22:55.875 --> 22:59.333
I got to be there

23:01.291 --> 23:06.500
Winnie the Pooh
