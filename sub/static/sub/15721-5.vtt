<i>You keep</i> <i>an eye on Wes?</i>

00:03.209 --> 00:05.467
- He's very depressed, David.
- Yeah, I know, Mayko told me.

00:05.764 --> 00:08.428
- My eyes are bleeding.
- It's a side effect of the interferon.

00:08.589 --> 00:12.286
- And my HIV's gonna turn to AIDS, Bob.
- I can't leave you. I'm...

00:15.444 --> 00:16.728
It's mainly his left side.

00:17.036 --> 00:18.980
Fractured distal tibia, broken femur.

00:19.279 --> 00:20.732
I'm gonna die, Rachel.

00:20.892 --> 00:22.642
I'm experiencing strange memories.

00:22.762 --> 00:24.944
Roth's lab. Except it's deserted.

00:25.105 --> 00:27.059
You know the woman I was thinking about?

00:27.179 --> 00:29.240
- I can draw her.
- She's pretty.

00:29.586 --> 00:31.117
Get me the Amsterdam treatment.

00:31.277 --> 00:34.162
- It's too experimental.
- Do it. Give me the treatment.

00:34.323 --> 00:35.580
What else can I do?

00:38.942 --> 00:41.002
Help! He's not breathing!

00:41.163 --> 00:43.953
Take it easy. It's okay.
I need someone, now!

00:54.545 --> 00:57.044
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

00:58.018 --> 01:00.684
I think
you can give a little credit to Wes.

01:02.364 --> 01:06.027
From what you've told me, it sounds like
he put you in a very tough position.

01:06.447 --> 01:07.987
It doesn't excuse what I did.

01:08.461 --> 01:09.864
He's in anaphylactic shock.

01:10.025 --> 01:12.075
Stay with me, Wes.
What the hell happened in here?

01:16.624 --> 01:18.323
I could have killed him.

01:20.714 --> 01:21.744
Any idea...

01:22.174 --> 01:24.170
why he had an allergic reaction?

01:25.744 --> 01:27.770
I don't know.
I mean, it could have been the linkers

01:27.890 --> 01:31.353
that attach the Hep C receptors
to the red blood cells.

01:31.473 --> 01:32.388
But...

01:33.006 --> 01:35.671
that would take months to figure out,
and...

01:38.751 --> 01:40.437
he doesn't have months.

01:46.119 --> 01:48.361
We'll make him as comfortable as we can.

01:50.063 --> 01:51.755
That sounds so terminal.

01:52.305 --> 01:53.714
I'm sorry, Rachel.

01:54.063 --> 01:55.243
I can't give up.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.036
I'm not saying that you should.

01:58.263 --> 02:01.416
But if you try
any more experiments in this hospital,

02:01.818 --> 02:03.835
you could be facing criminal charges.

02:06.401 --> 02:07.547
I understand.

02:10.508 --> 02:13.062
And I'm willing
to face the consequences.

'Morning.

04:03.116 --> 04:04.878
You seen Rachel anywhere?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.752
She does still work here, doesn't she?

04:13.144 --> 04:14.547
Mayko, you're fired.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.172
She went to the hospital
last night to be with Wes.

04:17.463 --> 04:19.928
- How's he doing?
- I haven't heard from her this morning.

04:20.089 --> 04:23.081
Look, did you read this?
The girl poisoned in Ottawa?

04:23.720 --> 04:25.959
She's the daughter
of City Councilor Randall Oberman.

04:26.079 --> 04:28.273
He's trying to stop
the construction of a mosque.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.313
Any reason?

04:29.647 --> 04:31.114
Some kind of zoning issue.

04:31.234 --> 04:34.203
But of course he's got
the Muslim community all over him.

04:34.453 --> 04:36.661
So he thinks
they poisoned his daughter?

04:36.955 --> 04:38.629
That's what Oberman's saying.

04:38.749 --> 04:41.451
He got a bunch of death threats
since he spoke out against the mosque.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.647
And the Muslims
are calling it discrimination.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.781
They've been
under a lot of harassment since 9-11.

04:45.901 --> 04:47.700
People want them out
of the neighborhood.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.125
How's the girl doing?

04:49.286 --> 04:52.336
She's still in hospital.
They can't ID the poison.

04:52.456 --> 04:54.445
So they don't even know
if she was poisoned?

04:54.565 --> 04:55.615
I guess.

04:55.882 --> 04:59.135
Sounds like political bullshit
to get people on Oberman's side, Mayko.

04:59.296 --> 05:01.946
- Maybe we should look into it.
- I knew you were going there!

05:02.066 --> 05:05.114
They had to close down the high school
after they had a near riot...

05:05.234 --> 05:07.168
'cause a bunch of kids
attacked some Muslim kids.

05:07.288 --> 05:09.395
And then some Muslims
went and defaced a local church.

05:09.556 --> 05:11.230
Can't we all just get along?

05:11.524 --> 05:12.328
What?

05:12.448 --> 05:13.717
Hello, David.

05:14.130 --> 05:17.024
I hope it's about Olivier Roth
wanting to have lunch with me.

05:17.144 --> 05:19.502
What do you know
about Lincoln, Nebraska?

05:19.622 --> 05:21.641
They got a great tractor museum.

05:21.761 --> 05:23.743
Yes, about the woman with smallpox.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.312
She doesn't have smallpox.
She's got vaccinia.

05:26.877 --> 05:29.333
- David...
- It is a weaker cousin of smallpox

05:29.453 --> 05:30.875
- used in a vaccine.
- I know.

05:31.238 --> 05:34.712
CDC says she got it from her husband.
He was a Marine on his way to Iraq.

05:34.873 --> 05:38.356
He was vaccinated against smallpox.
He kissed his wife goodbye and

05:38.476 --> 05:41.427
managed to pass on the closest thing
to smallpox a human being can get.

05:41.644 --> 05:42.735
She's dying.

05:42.855 --> 05:44.332
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>

05:44.529 --> 05:48.142
The FDA is willing to fast-track
some drugs for compassionate use.

05:49.595 --> 05:50.776
What drugs?

05:51.512 --> 05:54.352
Homeland Security commissioned
three biotechnology companies

05:54.472 --> 05:56.525
to come up with a cure
in case of a smallpox attack.

05:56.645 --> 05:58.319
Oh yeah? How'd they do?

05:58.603 --> 05:59.657
Don't know.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.462
Never tested it
on an actual smallpox victim.

06:02.582 --> 06:06.158
<i>That's because smallpox
was eradicated in 1977, Carl.</i>

06:06.278 --> 06:09.579
Yeah.
Well, now we have a unique opportunity.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.370
Carl, referring to a dying woman
as a "unique opportunity" is sick.

06:14.745 --> 06:15.736
Whatever.

06:16.032 --> 06:18.339
Homeland wants NorBAC's opinion
on which drug to use.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.074
Fine. I'll need to see
all the studies done by the companies,

06:21.194 --> 06:23.894
- both successes and failures.
- It's on its way.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.644
- How many days do we have?
- 24 hours.

06:26.978 --> 06:29.479
- Why the rush?
- It's all the time she's got left.

06:33.183 --> 06:33.995
No.

06:53.770 --> 06:55.103
Nicely done.

06:56.738 --> 06:58.838
I don't think
you should put this on your resume.

07:00.034 --> 07:02.177
Wes, Wes... I'm so sorry.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.803
- It's okay.
- So, how are you feeling?

07:07.646 --> 07:09.924
- The broken ribs aren't bad.
- Right.

07:10.044 --> 07:11.418
My leg is a little itchy,

07:11.538 --> 07:13.884
my kidneys and liver ache, but...

07:14.004 --> 07:15.878
other than that, I'm really...

07:15.998 --> 07:17.077
top notch.

07:20.833 --> 07:23.463
You do have that sexy yellow glow.

07:25.185 --> 07:26.296
Thank you.

07:28.029 --> 07:30.987
I was beginning to think I was
on the losing end of death's stick,

07:31.107 --> 07:32.217
Miss Woods.

07:35.321 --> 07:37.570
So, how soon can we try that again?

07:45.554 --> 07:47.845
- What, are you serious?
- Oh yes.

07:49.017 --> 07:52.308
I know you'll figure out
what I reacted to and you'll fix it.

07:53.156 --> 07:55.172
And then we can go again, right?

07:55.920 --> 07:59.023
Right now, maybe you should recover
from my first attempt to kill you.

08:01.092 --> 08:03.127
I'm ready to go anytime you are.

08:08.494 --> 08:09.932
You're a mess.

08:12.681 --> 08:14.514
You know that, don't you?

08:16.792 --> 08:19.087
I know you're not gonna give up on me.

08:20.142 --> 08:22.296
And I know
you're gonna figure something out.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.907
Okay, thank you.

08:33.546 --> 08:36.101
So, hey, according to the CDC,

08:36.261 --> 08:39.698
all three drugs were used in a study
with cynomolgus monkeys

08:39.818 --> 08:42.607
with high intravenous doses of pox,
equivalent

08:42.768 --> 08:45.224
- to late-stage disease in humans.
- And?

08:51.253 --> 08:55.037
All animals that received the drug
were protected from  the disease.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.639
In monkeys?

08:56.759 --> 08:57.915
In monkeys.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.525
It's a start. We got a long way to go
to the finish line, so let's dig in.

09:02.645 --> 09:04.255
What?
Hey, you in Lincoln?

09:04.416 --> 09:07.288
Yeah, I just got to the hospital.
Has the data arrived yet?

09:07.408 --> 09:09.497
Yeah, we're just starting to go over it.

09:10.796 --> 09:12.972
You better look at it fast, David.

09:13.565 --> 09:15.650
I think
they may have called us too late.

09:16.510 --> 09:19.385
- Captain Richard Hilliard.
- Dr. Carlos Serrano.

09:20.482 --> 09:21.891
Marianne Wiley was admitted

09:22.057 --> 09:24.817
with a blistering rash
and a mild fever three days ago.

09:25.348 --> 09:27.528
Once they figured out what was going on,
they started her

09:27.689 --> 09:29.974
on vaccinia immunoglobulin therapy.

09:30.094 --> 09:31.824
Clearly not working.

09:31.985 --> 09:34.785
- Have you tried antivirals?
- I've tried everything.

09:39.215 --> 09:40.632
- May I?
- Sure.

09:47.816 --> 09:49.357
I'm Dr. Carlos Serrano,

09:49.477 --> 09:52.371
with a lab that's here
to research the different treatments.

09:52.491 --> 09:53.637
Yes, have you decided?

09:54.066 --> 09:55.427
We're not quite there yet.

09:55.547 --> 09:58.179
- Well, she can't wait that long.
- Mark...

09:59.337 --> 10:00.776
Let him do his job.

10:03.147 --> 10:06.265
Sorry, sir.
I'm Mark Wiley, Marianne's husband.

10:07.019 --> 10:08.038
Hi.

10:09.541 --> 10:10.938
Marianne, how are you?

10:13.283 --> 10:16.204
We're going to need
to do a quick examination.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.707
It hurts her to be touched, okay?

10:18.877 --> 10:21.618
She says it feels
like her skin is tearing off.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.457
That's all right,
we don't need to touch her.

10:24.636 --> 10:26.138
What about her pain?

10:27.359 --> 10:29.107
We can increase the morphine.

10:29.277 --> 10:32.015
But we'll have to put you
on a ventilator.

10:32.886 --> 10:35.629
- Baby, it's okay ?
- It will give your body a rest.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.716
I'm afraid...

10:38.976 --> 10:42.094
Don't be afraid.
I'm like an alarm clock, okay?

10:42.669 --> 10:45.313
Take the morphine.
Give your body a rest.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.911
Doc, may I have a word?

10:50.242 --> 10:51.260
Sure.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.815
Increase morphine to comfort
and prepare for intubation.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.784
Just hang in there. I'll be right back.

11:09.911 --> 11:11.165
So how come I'm not sick?

11:12.500 --> 11:15.502
Your body's healthy
and you can cope with a live vaccine.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.589
I don't understand.
Marianne was healthy too.

11:18.849 --> 11:21.140
Well, Marianne has eczema,

11:21.388 --> 11:23.951
which can be a sign
of an immune deficiency.

11:24.121 --> 11:25.888
But how did she get it from me?

11:26.943 --> 11:30.855
Pox viruses are usually transmitted
through close oral contact,

11:31.545 --> 11:33.543
a cough, maybe a sneeze,

11:34.949 --> 11:37.607
- maybe a kiss.
- A kiss...

11:38.476 --> 11:39.785
did this?

11:41.699 --> 11:43.008
Thank you, sir.

12:03.825 --> 12:05.552
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.338
Sorry I'm late.

12:07.508 --> 12:08.799
So, what's up?

12:09.860 --> 12:11.183
How's Wes?

12:12.863 --> 12:13.897
He's...

12:16.321 --> 12:18.065
I almost killed him, David.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.020
Come here.

12:21.364 --> 12:22.653
Come here.
Sit down.

12:24.546 --> 12:25.745
What happened?

12:26.571 --> 12:28.492
A systemic allergic reaction.

12:29.878 --> 12:31.490
He's all right now?

12:31.660 --> 12:32.909
Yeah, he's...

12:35.089 --> 12:37.559
I spent the last I don't know
how many hours going over this,

12:37.729 --> 12:39.150
and I can't...

12:39.590 --> 12:41.880
I can't figure it out.
I don't know what else to do.

12:42.469 --> 12:43.516
It's okay.

12:45.638 --> 12:48.679
- I don't think he'll make it.
- Ah, come on! Fuck that shit!

12:48.939 --> 12:51.382
I know, but David,
I have tried everything,

12:51.552 --> 12:53.225
and I don't know what else to do.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.218
What do you know about BT-590?

12:57.582 --> 12:58.859
Protease inhibitors?

12:59.029 --> 13:01.550
Just that toxicity is an issue
with that.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.516
We'll think of something

13:06.686 --> 13:09.074
We are going to think of something.

13:10.943 --> 13:12.786
- I have to stay on this.
- Absolutely.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.049
You do what you have to do.

13:15.696 --> 13:17.082
- Thank you.
- Okay.

13:31.734 --> 13:34.420
Is it smallpox, Captain?
Should we be concerned?

13:34.590 --> 13:35.906
No, it's not smallpox.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.567
But it has many of the same symptoms
and it can kill people.

13:38.737 --> 13:40.124
That's not true.

13:40.294 --> 13:41.678
Is it contagious, Captain?

13:41.848 --> 13:44.271
Should the military stop
the inoculation program?

13:44.441 --> 13:47.651
No, it's not contagious.
Excuse me, we're late for a meeting.

13:47.821 --> 13:50.360
Are the inoculations safe
for our troops?

13:50.530 --> 13:51.549
Yes.

13:54.045 --> 13:57.032
What you told
that reporter is actually not true.

13:57.363 --> 14:01.313
Marianne caught it from her husband,
so technically, it is contagious.

14:01.896 --> 14:03.420
We don't need to start a panic.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.548
- It could happen again.
- This was a perfect storm,

14:06.808 --> 14:09.593
with several highly unusual conditions
coming together.

14:10.191 --> 14:13.054
- But the chances of reoccurrence...
- Are greater than zero.

14:13.904 --> 14:15.249
Dr. Serrano,

14:15.419 --> 14:18.395
the safety of our men and women
in uniform is not compromised

14:18.565 --> 14:19.936
by these vaccinations.

14:20.196 --> 14:22.909
Any time you're dealing
with a live virus,

14:23.079 --> 14:25.317
there is the possibility
of side effects.

14:25.818 --> 14:29.092
And that is something the press
would have a field day with.

14:29.262 --> 14:31.031
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.577
You're referring to the truth?

14:51.748 --> 14:54.063
How much longer do we have to wait?

14:57.232 --> 14:58.967
I'll make the call now.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.032
<i>What?</i>

15:15.294 --> 15:18.572
- David, I need an answer now.
- What happened to 24 hours?

15:18.692 --> 15:20.526
Her abdomen is starting
to fill with fluid

15:20.646 --> 15:22.386
and her kidneys are close to failing.

15:22.556 --> 15:25.023
- It's not looking good.
- Okay, um...

15:25.408 --> 15:27.516
- Give me 24 minutes.
- Okay.

15:34.637 --> 15:36.580
Bob! Mayko!

15:38.483 --> 15:40.809
- The CR-356 has some heart issues.
- What kind?

15:41.069 --> 15:43.293
- QT prolongation.
- I called their chief scientist.

15:43.463 --> 15:45.334
He couldn't convince himself
it was safe.

15:45.504 --> 15:47.341
I had a comparison done of their studies

15:47.511 --> 15:49.895
and the long QT issues
make CR-356 questionable.

15:50.065 --> 15:52.002
Okay, that sounds pretty conclusive.

15:52.172 --> 15:54.344
CR-356,

15:54.688 --> 15:55.782
heart issues.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.035
Let's sideline it, that leaves us

15:58.205 --> 16:01.012
with ST-146 from QuestLogic

16:01.246 --> 16:03.864
and LB-320

16:04.034 --> 16:05.250
from VacMed.

16:05.510 --> 16:08.169
Each of the remaining two drugs have
the same pharmacophore.

16:08.429 --> 16:10.321
LB-320 is a pro drug, though, right?

16:10.491 --> 16:13.258
Yes. It's inactive till your body
changes it to an active form.

16:13.468 --> 16:14.808
Meaning it may last longer.

16:14.928 --> 16:17.304
It'll be active in your body
for a longer period of time.

16:17.564 --> 16:18.656
That's good.

16:18.826 --> 16:22.317
But it showed elevated liver enzymes...
in rodents.

16:22.487 --> 16:24.644
- High toxicity?
- Correct.

16:24.904 --> 16:27.607
QuestLogic's 146 does have
a wider dose range.

16:27.727 --> 16:30.435
That nails it. It's safer
and we can give more of the drug to her

16:30.605 --> 16:32.148
without worrying about side effects.

16:32.318 --> 16:34.897
But QuestLogic has done
some iffy pre-clinical studies.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.474
Remember that big FDA thing?

16:36.644 --> 16:40.326
I do, but they cleaned house since then.
They got a new chief scientist.

16:40.446 --> 16:43.200
And more importantly, their drug
is least likely to harm the patient.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.749
That's our priority.
Where are the drugs?

16:46.009 --> 16:49.213
- They're already at the hospital.
- Dr. Corwin, how is he?

16:52.141 --> 16:53.243
Oh, my God!

16:56.553 --> 16:57.586
Oh, my God!

17:05.965 --> 17:08.320
- Where are the drugs?
- Already in the hospital at Lincoln.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.982
Carlos, QuestLogic ST-146.

17:11.242 --> 17:12.776
Best guess. Hang on.

17:13.654 --> 17:15.830
I got another call. Go for it.

17:16.189 --> 17:17.194
What?

17:18.546 --> 17:21.159
Seriously, who is this?
Fuck off! Who is this?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.790
Well yeah,
it does kind of sound like you,

17:27.050 --> 17:28.057
Sir.

17:31.144 --> 17:32.343
Yeah, sure.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.541
Okay.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.101
Right. I understand.

17:39.396 --> 17:40.443
Just...

17:42.193 --> 17:44.808
That was the... Prime Minister.

17:46.835 --> 17:49.771
He wants us to look into the poisoning.
There have been more reprisals.

17:50.031 --> 17:52.482
I told you!
Has anybody been hurt?

17:52.742 --> 17:55.424
He says it's just a matter of time.
The local imam

17:55.594 --> 17:58.696
as agreed to let us act
as a neutral investigating...

17:59.474 --> 18:00.281
What?

18:00.824 --> 18:03.076
- It's working.
- What?

18:03.965 --> 18:06.899
The treatment that almost killed Wes,
it's working.

18:07.188 --> 18:09.040
His Hep C viral load is down.

18:11.487 --> 18:12.796
It's working.

18:21.641 --> 18:22.867
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:24.093 --> 18:25.802
I knew you could do it.

18:27.124 --> 18:28.915
How are you feeling?

18:30.197 --> 18:33.641
I don't think I could run a marathon
or anything, but...

18:34.757 --> 18:36.526
Yeah, you're doing fine.

18:38.270 --> 18:39.386
So are you.

18:49.774 --> 18:50.748
Marianne...

18:52.760 --> 18:55.587
This drug has never been used
on a human being before.

18:57.075 --> 18:59.969
It's been successful in animal trials.

19:01.153 --> 19:03.096
I think it's your best hope,

19:03.633 --> 19:05.888
but I'm going to need your permission.

19:07.536 --> 19:08.900
It's okay, sweetie.

19:09.529 --> 19:10.943
You need to get better now.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.744
If you could just sign here.

19:24.187 --> 19:26.067
Well, that's okay. You can sign it.

19:26.619 --> 19:27.535
Yes, sir.

19:33.918 --> 19:35.761
I've been talking with...

19:36.294 --> 19:38.887
the head of the burn unit here,
Dr. Fleming.

19:39.529 --> 19:42.765
She's done incredible things
with artificial skin technology.

19:44.218 --> 19:45.814
She uses collagen,

19:45.934 --> 19:48.648
and she's able to grow epidermal cells
directly on it.

19:50.279 --> 19:51.859
She tells me you're a good candidate.

19:55.625 --> 19:56.731
My skin...

19:58.779 --> 20:00.243
Can be repaired.

20:06.657 --> 20:08.334
I had her tested and retested.

20:08.494 --> 20:10.592
Still no trace of any poison
that we can find.

20:10.712 --> 20:13.035
- And yet the symptoms...
- Consistent with poisoning.

20:13.155 --> 20:14.727
It's okay, he's with me.

20:15.718 --> 20:16.788
Mr. Oberman.

20:17.218 --> 20:19.118
More doctors to shrug their shoulders?

20:19.450 --> 20:21.097
No, sir. I'm David Sandström.

20:21.217 --> 20:23.296
North American Biotechnology
Advisory Commission.

20:23.416 --> 20:25.222
The Prime Minister has asked us
to help out.

20:25.342 --> 20:26.718
Good. Thank you.

20:27.674 --> 20:30.131
I'm Stella's father, Randall Oberman.

20:32.281 --> 20:34.235
Can you... tell me what happened?

20:34.583 --> 20:37.619
Stella came home around 10 pm,
the day before yesterday.

20:38.368 --> 20:41.008
She was acting disoriented.
I thought she was...

20:41.128 --> 20:42.660
on drugs or had been drinking.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.447
She is 14.

20:47.216 --> 20:49.097
Later, she threw up.
She wanted to go to bed.

20:49.217 --> 20:52.062
I checked on her around 12 midnight

20:52.182 --> 20:54.731
and she was sweating
like she'd just run a marathon.

20:54.851 --> 20:57.759
She couldn't catch her breath.
I called an ambulance.

20:59.033 --> 21:01.512
When she was admitted,
her temperature was 41.

21:01.672 --> 21:03.851
She had tremors,
and then some kind of a seizure.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.350
A couple of hours later,
she was comatose.

21:07.484 --> 21:09.729
Has anything like this
ever happened to her before?

21:10.401 --> 21:11.510
No. No.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.618
We can't bring her temperature down.

21:14.738 --> 21:18.656
We've got her on maximum blood pressure
medication and full ventilator support.

21:18.776 --> 21:20.550
We ran the full gamut of tests.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.783
Checked electrolytes, glucose.
All normal.

21:23.779 --> 21:25.494
- No source of infection?
- No.

21:25.654 --> 21:27.015
Cultures are negative.

21:27.135 --> 21:28.831
Antibiotics aren't doing anything.

21:29.232 --> 21:31.959
Look, we have an expert here now,
Doctor.

21:32.497 --> 21:33.862
Let him take over.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.222
Actually, Mr. Oberman, I'm a scientist.

21:37.342 --> 21:40.496
Dr. Modi is a physician.
I need to hear what he has to say.

21:42.591 --> 21:44.232
We did a full toxicology screen.

21:44.352 --> 21:47.600
I sent blood and urine samples to two
poison centers in Quebec and Toronto.

21:47.779 --> 21:49.977
- So, you're treating the symptoms?
- As best as we can.

21:51.089 --> 21:52.355
Excuse me.

21:56.071 --> 21:59.236
Hopefully we won't have to deal
with his incompetence much longer.

22:00.438 --> 22:02.816
It looks like
he's doing everything right.

22:03.159 --> 22:05.087
Maybe for wherever he came from.

22:06.478 --> 22:10.247
Mr. Oberman, where was your daughter
before she came home?

22:12.780 --> 22:14.579
There was a dance at school.

22:15.476 --> 22:17.717
Stella said she was going,
but no one saw her there.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.548
They must've grabbed her.

22:19.902 --> 22:20.652
They?

22:20.772 --> 22:22.440
Some boys, Arabs.

22:22.833 --> 22:26.764
Muslims kids had been taunting her
at school and defaced her locker.

22:27.081 --> 22:29.266
- You told this to the police?
- Of course! They...

22:30.681 --> 22:32.367
They questioned the boys.

22:32.487 --> 22:34.179
They stuck together...

22:34.299 --> 22:37.389
they said they hadn't seen Stella
that night. They had their...

22:37.509 --> 22:38.721
lies all ready to go.

22:38.841 --> 22:39.992
Or the truth.

22:42.703 --> 22:44.603
Listen, Mr. Oberman, I'm just here

22:44.723 --> 22:47.282
to find out what's making
your daughter sick, all right?

22:47.402 --> 22:48.994
Not to start a holy war.

22:49.728 --> 22:51.062
If she dies...

22:53.403 --> 22:54.216
Yeah.

23:01.404 --> 23:04.143
The therapy I want to get, though,
hyperbaric oxygen therapy,

23:04.263 --> 23:06.469
is a well-established medical treatment.

23:06.589 --> 23:09.223
Can it do anything for a guy
with half a liver?

23:10.903 --> 23:12.811
It's okay, Bob. I'm doing fine.

23:15.158 --> 23:18.481
Hyperbaric treatment
is more for embolisms,

23:19.004 --> 23:20.567
carbon monoxide poisoning,

23:21.062 --> 23:22.073
gangrene...

23:22.193 --> 23:26.073
What I wouldn't do for a good
old-fashioned gangrene right about now!

23:27.400 --> 23:28.220
Yeah...

23:30.448 --> 23:32.163
Why the sudden interest in this thing?

23:32.718 --> 23:35.453
Oh, well, there is some evidence
that it can also help

23:35.573 --> 23:39.170
with intracranial abscess,
an increase of pus in the brain.

23:39.879 --> 23:42.283
- That's what you've got?
- I think so.

23:42.403 --> 23:44.178
Antibiotics aren't working?

23:45.614 --> 23:47.060
Tell me how it works.

23:48.526 --> 23:49.929
I'll go inside it.

23:50.049 --> 23:53.734
Then the atmospheric pressure
will be increased

23:54.464 --> 23:56.507
to the prescribed amount
for the treatment.

23:56.627 --> 24:00.845
And then I'll be given 100% oxygen
to breathe for a set amount of time.

24:01.018 --> 24:02.415
That'll clear up your brain?

24:03.046 --> 24:05.402
In combination with the antibiotics,

24:06.126 --> 24:08.063
it has proven to be effective.

24:09.759 --> 24:11.076
That's out-there.

24:12.590 --> 24:16.670
At one time, inserting an electronic
device into the chest cavity

24:16.790 --> 24:19.880
to stimulate the heart was considered...

24:20.000 --> 24:21.629
kind-of-out-there.

24:24.384 --> 24:27.083
Today, there are millions
of pacemakers in use.

24:33.317 --> 24:35.639
- Better go.
- Thanks for coming by.

24:39.901 --> 24:40.606
Bob...

24:44.477 --> 24:46.779
I'm sorry about
what happened up on the roof.

24:49.226 --> 24:50.206
So am I.

24:52.152 --> 24:55.275
I know what you were going through
and I should have...{\
- No.}

24:56.292 --> 24:57.153
Don't.

24:59.773 --> 25:00.962
Thanks though.

25:02.517 --> 25:04.254
Hey, thanks for the books
you brought me.

25:06.116 --> 25:08.175
- Used is okay?
- Yeah, it's great.

25:09.152 --> 25:12.272
I haven't read this one before
and my sleep is important.

25:17.969 --> 25:19.395
Get better Wes, okay?

25:22.527 --> 25:23.527
I miss you.

25:40.014 --> 25:42.626
- Hey, Carlos! When did you get back?
- Last night.

25:43.013 --> 25:45.492
- We made the right call. She's stable.
- Fantastic!

25:45.612 --> 25:46.755
Bob, how's Wes doing?

25:47.459 --> 25:50.033
He's eating, sitting up.
He's doing fine, David.

25:50.153 --> 25:52.461
- What's going on around here?
- What do you mean?

25:52.629 --> 25:54.126
Nothing but good news.

25:55.299 --> 25:57.216
What have we got on those poison, Bob?

25:57.336 --> 25:59.733
Alcohols, amphetamines barbiturates,

25:59.853 --> 26:02.780
MDMA, paracetamol,
salicylate, all negative.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.155
Ditto: opiates, tricyclics...

26:05.275 --> 26:07.126
- Okay.
- Beta-blockers, anti...

26:07.275 --> 26:08.861
Okay, Bob! Anything positive?

26:09.286 --> 26:11.018
Everything was negative.

26:11.138 --> 26:13.718
'Morning. Got that list
of all the obscure poisons?

26:13.838 --> 26:15.027
I found hundreds.{\
- Jesus!}

26:15.147 --> 26:18.217
Some are really weird.
Ever heard of Zuclopenthixol?

26:18.337 --> 26:21.342
Alright, we screen for all of them.
Mayko, set up a database.

26:21.462 --> 26:24.194
Bob, Carlos, you look
for any combinations of poisons,

26:24.314 --> 26:25.961
natural, man-made, medicinal, fungal...

26:26.517 --> 26:28.610
Anything out of the ordinary,
red flag it.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.416
- What's up?
- I did an Ellman assay,

27:11.536 --> 27:14.099
- a test for cholinesterase.
- Neurotransmission suppressant?

27:14.219 --> 27:16.883
Looks like she has reduced activity.
Don't know if it's significant.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.217
- Source?
- Maybe a pesticide.

27:19.383 --> 27:21.846
- Do we know what kind?
- Not really.

27:32.315 --> 27:33.237
Up here.

27:34.526 --> 27:38.158
- Have you checked everything?
- Yes. I'll redo it if you like.

27:38.318 --> 27:40.451
- Maybe you'd better.
- I'll use a fresh kit.

27:40.571 --> 27:43.275
- We need to be really sure about this.
- Yeah, I understand.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.541
Wait a minute.

27:45.201 --> 27:47.209
How much pesticide would it take
to do this?

27:47.552 --> 27:49.461
Don't know.
The test isn't that quantitative.

27:49.621 --> 27:51.755
Find a test
that'll give us concentration levels.

27:51.915 --> 27:52.732
On it.

27:58.979 --> 28:03.308
Our girl may have been poisoned
with a cholinesterase inhibitor.

28:04.089 --> 28:05.179
What's that?

28:05.299 --> 28:08.105
Something that sends your heart and
lungs into overdrive. You can't stop.

28:08.847 --> 28:11.400
- It is treatable, alright?
- Yeah, with pralidoximine.

28:12.831 --> 28:13.826
Work with Bob.

28:13.946 --> 28:16.947
If you can confirm that 
it's a pesticide, call me immediately.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.223
Okay.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.635
Mayko, I need everything you can get me
on cholinesterase inhibitors,

28:22.755 --> 28:25.729
everything they're used in,
where they're manufactured, imports

28:25.849 --> 28:26.690
and then,

28:27.450 --> 28:30.585
get in touch with the Defense Department
to see if they've had been stolen.

28:30.804 --> 28:33.816
If it's a pesticide, why would Defense?

28:34.750 --> 28:37.258
Because one of its uses is in nerve gas.

28:38.266 --> 28:39.297
Oh man!

28:40.582 --> 28:41.741
Where are you going?

28:42.270 --> 28:45.949
Back to Ottawa. I don't want
to deliver this news on the phone.

28:46.676 --> 28:50.121
Dr. Corwin said my liver
was severely damaged by the virus.

28:50.824 --> 28:53.555
Damaged, but not irreparable.

28:53.675 --> 28:56.627
It's a transplant
and it could take years to find a liver.

28:59.425 --> 29:01.859
Wes, I think that's only one option.

29:02.058 --> 29:04.055
You don't think it's a good idea?

29:04.392 --> 29:08.070
Progression of the HCV infection
is sometimes accelerated

29:08.190 --> 29:09.923
with transplantation.

29:11.322 --> 29:12.271
And...

29:13.301 --> 29:14.169
What?

29:14.805 --> 29:18.977
you may face bone marrow toxicity
and the risk of allograft rejection...

29:24.256 --> 29:26.248
What are our alternatives, then?

29:28.004 --> 29:29.711
I'm looking into it.

29:30.345 --> 29:32.009
But the good news is,

29:32.293 --> 29:33.382
you're stable,

29:33.502 --> 29:37.189
and that gives us some time
to explore those options, right?

29:38.767 --> 29:40.173
- Sure.
- It's...

29:42.786 --> 29:44.404
You're going to be okay.

29:45.189 --> 29:46.572
I know, Doctor.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.415
I'm already better than okay.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.075
Come in, Dr. Sandström.

29:57.705 --> 30:01.050
- This is Detective Ian McGilvray.
- Hey! David Sandström.

30:01.628 --> 30:03.929
Look, I wanted to bring this to you
personally, okay?

30:04.595 --> 30:06.932
We think we have a lead on a possible,

30:07.092 --> 30:08.658
a <i>possible</i> poison,

30:08.778 --> 30:10.810
something called
a cholinesterase inhibitor.

30:11.358 --> 30:13.232
Nothing conclusive,
but we're chasing it.

30:13.352 --> 30:15.690
Dr. Modi is on his way 
with some medication.

30:15.810 --> 30:19.241
- What kind of poison is that?
- It's something you find in pesticides.

30:19.361 --> 30:21.446
Is there anything
she could have gotten into?

30:21.701 --> 30:22.974
Accidentally?

30:23.094 --> 30:23.907
No.

30:24.883 --> 30:26.952
We're talking about
an over-the-counter poison?

30:27.484 --> 30:29.454
We don't have
any conclusive evidence yet.

30:29.711 --> 30:32.624
- Sounds to me like you do.
- No. We're still running tests.

30:32.851 --> 30:35.978
In the meantime, it's more important
to treat Stella, just in case.

30:36.287 --> 30:39.047
It's just as important to put
the person behind bars who did this!

30:39.167 --> 30:40.245
That's his job.

30:40.488 --> 30:42.801
In the meantime,
given the mood of the neighborhood,

30:42.961 --> 30:47.229
Prime Minister has asked that we do not
go public until we are 100% certain,

30:47.929 --> 30:51.643
and until somebody is under arrest,
if somebody is behind this.

30:52.036 --> 30:53.979
You still think this is an accident?

30:54.485 --> 30:56.759
Mr. Oberman, I don't know!

31:01.855 --> 31:04.281
If you get the name of that poison,
I want it.{\
- Sure}

31:04.441 --> 31:05.892
And what you told us,

31:06.344 --> 31:07.617
that's between us.

31:08.446 --> 31:10.495
No one leaks it to the press.

31:14.690 --> 31:17.950
We agreed to keep this under the radar
until we find what we're dealing with.

31:18.070 --> 31:21.818
I redid the Ellman assay. It still
looks like a cholinesterase inhibitor.

31:21.938 --> 31:23.550
- But a small amount.
- You IDed it?

31:23.766 --> 31:25.495
Not yet. Still testing.

31:26.214 --> 31:27.395
How's the girl?

31:28.401 --> 31:30.089
- You talking to David?
- Yeah.

31:31.589 --> 31:33.065
Oh, and here's Mayko.

31:34.448 --> 31:35.529
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

31:35.649 --> 31:39.106
So, I called the Department of Defense.
Nothing was stolen.

31:39.226 --> 31:41.303
Now, I did come across something else.

31:41.423 --> 31:44.772
The Nazis were busy making
cholinesterase inhibitors for nerve gas.

31:44.892 --> 31:46.114
They never used it.

31:46.569 --> 31:51.064
The US have something called
the 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate aka BZ.

31:51.184 --> 31:53.788
- Tons of it is stockpiled.
- It's Vietnam era. It's old news.

31:53.948 --> 31:57.613
The Iraqis invented a similar product,
and after the US invasion,

31:57.733 --> 32:00.587
their stockpiles went missing.
Tons literally just vanished.

32:00.747 --> 32:03.715
- Ah, shit!
<i>- David, what are you thinking?</i>

32:03.835 --> 32:07.256
That an Iraqi weapon of mass destruction
ended up here, in Canada,

32:07.376 --> 32:09.537
and fell into the hands
of a Muslim extremist?

32:09.657 --> 32:12.068
And was used on a 14-year-old girl.

32:12.749 --> 32:14.835
Okay. I know I was stretching it.

32:15.187 --> 32:17.369
Listen, you keep on it, all right?

32:17.682 --> 32:20.393
Anything else comes up, let me know.
I'll be back tonight.

32:21.181 --> 32:23.150
Can I help you with something?

32:24.744 --> 32:26.029
You're here about Stella?

32:26.736 --> 32:27.673
Yes.

32:29.109 --> 32:29.935
I'm David.

32:30.340 --> 32:32.497
- From a lab in Toronto.
- Hi.

32:32.862 --> 32:34.078
You know Stella?

32:34.911 --> 32:35.942
She poisoned?

32:37.179 --> 32:39.334
We're leaning that way.
You want to talk about it?

32:40.629 --> 32:42.921
- Is she going to be okay?
- We don't know yet.

32:43.463 --> 32:44.714
What's your name?

32:45.953 --> 32:46.869
Nasib.

32:47.962 --> 32:49.344
We go to school together.

32:50.289 --> 32:53.473
Things had been a bit rough for her
for the last two weeks, since her dad...

32:53.633 --> 32:55.767
- Her dad is a fucking pig.
- Yeah.

32:57.524 --> 32:58.937
What are you doing here?

33:03.046 --> 33:04.007
I...

33:04.804 --> 33:06.933
- I gotta go.
- Okay. Listen...

33:10.061 --> 33:12.712
If there's anything,
okay, anything at all

33:12.832 --> 33:15.524
that you want to tell me
that could help Stella,

33:16.157 --> 33:17.727
you call me, all right?

33:38.423 --> 33:40.728
Hey, you're all set to go, aren't you?

33:41.282 --> 33:44.878
I cannot wait to have
a nice relaxing night in my own bed.

33:44.998 --> 33:45.951
I bet.

33:47.447 --> 33:48.971
You care to join me?

33:50.056 --> 33:53.017
I think that could probably be arranged.

33:56.331 --> 33:57.287
Although...

34:00.465 --> 34:02.834
we may have to spend a little time
getting you packed.

34:03.190 --> 34:05.082
Why, am I going somewhere?

34:09.174 --> 34:11.967
How does six months in Sweden sound?

34:13.645 --> 34:15.293
What's in Sweden?

34:15.770 --> 34:18.409
Wes, they're doing some new trials.

34:18.775 --> 34:20.270
In Sweden?

34:20.594 --> 34:23.608
Yeah, and it's some pretty heady stuff.

34:25.507 --> 34:28.628
They're using RNAi
to stop the Hep C virus.

34:29.283 --> 34:30.127
How?

34:30.666 --> 34:34.858
To stop the Hep C from replicating,
they put in RNA inhibitors

34:34.978 --> 34:38.226
that stick to the Hep C RNA like Velcro,

34:38.346 --> 34:40.989
and it helps your body
wipe out the disease.

34:44.761 --> 34:46.402
Can I get in the trials?

34:52.472 --> 34:53.527
You're in.

34:54.347 --> 34:55.589
- Really?
- Yes.

35:07.224 --> 35:08.894
Six months though?

35:11.238 --> 35:12.790
Only if you want.

35:16.042 --> 35:17.624
Thank you, Rachel.

35:19.968 --> 35:20.964
Really?

35:23.367 --> 35:24.707
I'm gonna miss you.

35:24.867 --> 35:26.531
I'm gonna miss you too.

35:30.984 --> 35:32.214
I love you.

35:32.712 --> 35:34.411
No matter what, okay?

35:37.634 --> 35:38.952
I love you too.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.240
From QuestLogic.

35:48.674 --> 35:51.717
Now that we've helped provide evidence
that their smallpox cure works,

35:51.837 --> 35:54.804
government's gonna buy millions of units
and the stock will go through the roof.

35:54.924 --> 35:57.104
And all we get
is this lousy gift basket, eh?

35:57.761 --> 35:59.354
Maybe not so lousy.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.412
- I thought you were only drinking beer.
- I am.

36:03.651 --> 36:05.706
I am saving this for Wes,

36:05.866 --> 36:06.833
on his return.

36:07.359 --> 36:09.744
- I'll get sure he actually gets some.
- Fine.

36:10.594 --> 36:11.462
Come in.

36:11.838 --> 36:12.880
Good timing.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.041
Good news?

36:14.161 --> 36:16.342
Cholinesterase inhibitor in the girl
is negligible.

36:17.465 --> 36:20.304
Not enough to make her sick.
I don't know if it's good news or not.

36:21.144 --> 36:23.140
Why did the poison tests
show results then?

36:23.300 --> 36:25.893
The tests are very sensitive now.
The same levels could be in any of us.

36:26.474 --> 36:28.271
Then what the hell is making her sick?

36:29.755 --> 36:33.365
Is there another poison
or are we completely misdiagnosing this?

36:33.876 --> 36:37.405
- Any other tests we can do?
- Let's go right back to symptomology.

36:37.566 --> 36:40.616
We've got sweating, heart palpitations,
we've got...

36:40.776 --> 36:43.369
anxiety, confusion and then coma, right?

36:44.653 --> 36:48.219
All right.
Cholinesterase inhibitors cause dryness.

36:48.339 --> 36:50.877
- You just said she was sweating.
- Her dad did, yeah.

36:50.997 --> 36:54.429
'Cause adrenaline or thyroid can make
the heart race and cause sweating.

36:54.550 --> 36:56.591
Adrenal glands were ruled out.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.384
Then it's gotta be the thyroid.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.009
Never got her thyroid test back.

37:00.129 --> 37:02.513
- Why not?
- Well, it takes 3 days to get results.

37:02.808 --> 37:05.184
Shit! Well, that's gotta be it!

37:05.674 --> 37:07.810
So, look, we treat her
for thyroid overactivity.

37:08.485 --> 37:09.359
What?

37:10.135 --> 37:11.147
Mr. Oberman.

37:12.678 --> 37:15.192
No, no. Don't make an announcement yet.
We haven't...

37:17.175 --> 37:18.175
Say again?

37:20.220 --> 37:22.241
- For fuck's sakes!
- What's wrong?

37:22.424 --> 37:24.201
<i>... where he will be formally charged.</i>

37:24.720 --> 37:27.038
That kid is innocent.
They're throwing gasoline on a fire.

37:27.198 --> 37:29.834
<i>... apparently attends
the same high school as Stella Oberman.</i>

37:29.954 --> 37:32.724
Hi, I need to speak
to Detective McGilvray, please.

37:32.844 --> 37:34.413
David Sandström calling.

37:35.142 --> 37:37.179
Oh, he'll know what this is about.

37:38.062 --> 37:39.976
You were supposed to call me

37:40.776 --> 37:42.774
before you made an announcement.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.468
There wasn't any poison.

37:46.904 --> 37:48.758
I said that no...

37:48.878 --> 37:50.516
Look, what I said

37:51.141 --> 37:53.149
was "possible poisoning."

37:54.855 --> 37:56.609
Because a thyroid storm... Thank you.

37:56.769 --> 38:00.970
A thyroid storm is consistent
with cholinesterase inhibitor poisoning.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.948
Again, look, here it is:

38:03.376 --> 38:07.194
her thyroid levels are through the roof,
and her TSH is suppressed, okay?

38:07.314 --> 38:09.538
That confirms a thyroid storm.

38:10.793 --> 38:12.531
You can't arrest a kid...

38:13.116 --> 38:15.108
You can't arrest a kid
for poisoning someone

38:15.228 --> 38:18.547
when there wasn't any fucking poison
in the first place!

38:18.708 --> 38:21.820
Let the kid go!
What part of that don't you understand?

38:21.940 --> 38:24.136
No crime has been committed here!

38:26.630 --> 38:27.736
Good choice.

38:28.476 --> 38:29.467
Thank you.

38:48.175 --> 38:48.979
What?

38:49.195 --> 38:51.586
<i>It's Narendra Modi. I've been trying
to call you since you left.</i>

38:51.706 --> 38:54.320
Ah yeah, Doctor.
Sorry, my cell phone died.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.072
They gave me your home phone.
I hope it's all right that I...

38:57.192 --> 38:58.916
Yeah, that's fine. What's up?

38:59.237 --> 39:01.385
The ultrasound confirmed
a thyroid nodule.

39:01.505 --> 39:04.635
The storm may have even been triggered
by the cholinesterase inhibitor.

39:05.318 --> 39:09.318
<i>We stabilized her medically and rushed
her into surgery earlier this evening.</i>

39:10.451 --> 39:12.393
- Her own body was poisoning her.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

39:12.870 --> 39:14.143
Which means this whole...

39:14.305 --> 39:17.523
witch hunt was just a fabrication
of one man's prejudice.

39:34.885 --> 39:35.707
What?

39:36.219 --> 39:37.037
Yeah.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.287
When?

39:47.846 --> 39:49.075
Okay, thank you.

39:53.164 --> 39:54.024
Shit...

40:17.102 --> 40:18.219
What is it?

40:19.605 --> 40:21.086
Marianne Wiley died last night.

40:23.013 --> 40:24.041
Dios mio!

40:25.194 --> 40:27.227
What was the official cause of death?

40:27.419 --> 40:28.782
Heart arrhythmia.

40:29.505 --> 40:30.721
Ah, that's terrible!

40:33.411 --> 40:35.156
QuestLogic was the right choice.

40:35.276 --> 40:38.519
Their drug was the least powerful.
It should have done nothing...

40:38.681 --> 40:39.813
She was very sick.

40:40.595 --> 40:42.976
It's very possible
that the drug had nothing to do with it.

40:43.096 --> 40:45.152
I know, it's just been a shitty week.

40:46.351 --> 40:48.622
Nice to get some good news
once in a while.

40:48.742 --> 40:49.574
Yeah.

40:50.420 --> 40:52.478
Anyway, I just thought you should know.

40:52.598 --> 40:53.598
Thank you.

41:02.886 --> 41:05.708
Thanks, Al.
And... good luck on that thing, eh!

41:08.933 --> 41:09.905
Wes!

41:11.215 --> 41:13.364
I hear you're off to Sweden. Great.

41:14.693 --> 41:16.992
Everywhere you look,
you can think of me.

41:19.787 --> 41:20.923
Here you go.

41:31.476 --> 41:34.227
You're not quitting.
You're on a six-month leave.

41:36.579 --> 41:38.747
I thought you might want to have this.

41:39.507 --> 41:41.563
It's a little going away present.

41:42.694 --> 41:44.114
It was Caroline's.

41:45.163 --> 41:48.458
It's got the name and numbers
of anybody who is anybody in Washington,

41:48.578 --> 41:50.866
London, Paris, Brussels. And I've...

41:51.891 --> 41:53.737
I've marked my leads on Roth.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.096
Wait. Wait. Wait.

42:02.689 --> 42:04.231
You know my liver's shot, David.

42:05.359 --> 42:06.513
Yeah, I know.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.483
This is for you.

42:14.276 --> 42:16.285
Here you go. Cheers!

42:18.377 --> 42:21.581
- I thought you stopped drinking, David.
- You're not quitting, Wes.

42:23.105 --> 42:24.974
- Yes, I am.
- You'll be back.

42:27.411 --> 42:28.739
I don't think so.

42:29.467 --> 42:30.289
Why?

42:30.620 --> 42:33.202
First of all, you're the biggest asshole
I've ever met.

42:33.322 --> 42:35.949
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Besides that.
- You're rude.

42:36.069 --> 42:37.723
You criticize everything that I do.

42:37.843 --> 42:39.197
You're pompous and arrogant.

42:39.317 --> 42:41.393
You say all that like it's a bad thing.

42:46.962 --> 42:50.652
Listen to me. And listen carefully
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.

42:53.868 --> 42:55.198
After the bombing...

42:59.332 --> 43:01.384
I thought NorBAC was finished.

43:01.504 --> 43:02.640
I really did.

43:05.724 --> 43:07.630
You put it back together, Wes.

43:09.107 --> 43:10.789
You put <i>us</i> back together.

43:13.519 --> 43:14.885
This is where you belong.

43:17.398 --> 43:20.239
In that office behind <i>that </i> desk.

43:24.959 --> 43:26.113
We need you.

43:29.561 --> 43:30.640
I need you.

43:33.153 --> 43:36.907
Who am I gonna find who can clean up
my shit better than you?

43:38.853 --> 43:40.285
Just so you know...

43:43.763 --> 43:45.601
I really don't want to leave,

43:46.110 --> 43:47.256
but I have to.

43:51.198 --> 43:52.839
Okay, I'm gonna do you a favor.

43:52.999 --> 43:55.389
- I don't want any favors.
- Two favors.

43:56.021 --> 43:58.437
First of all, I'm not gonna let you
run out that door

43:58.557 --> 44:01.610
so you bury your head in the sand,
which is what I think you're gonna do.

44:01.730 --> 44:03.858
- It's not what I'm doing.
- Two...

44:05.784 --> 44:07.145
you owe me a sucker punch.

44:07.305 --> 44:09.564
- I owe you more than one.
- Fine.

44:10.249 --> 44:14.321
So, I will let you hit me in the face
as hard as you want,

44:14.663 --> 44:15.800
if you stay.

44:22.841 --> 44:23.757
Okay.

44:29.534 --> 44:30.375
Okay.

44:31.266 --> 44:32.254
Shit...

44:37.518 --> 44:39.219
I hope you enjoy this as much as I will.

44:41.322 --> 44:44.815
- Guess I should close my eyes, eh?
- It might be better that way.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.453
Show me who's the better man, Wes.

44:54.593 --> 44:57.188
I know this is gonna hurt, David.

44:57.785 --> 44:58.869
I'm sorry.

44:59.392 --> 45:00.348
No worries.

45:01.318 --> 45:02.794
Gimme your best shot.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.005
Try not to kill me though.

45:31.848 --> 45:35.775
Over two dozen people with lung
infections is not an isolated incident,

45:35.935 --> 45:37.652
that is what we call an outbreak.

45:37.812 --> 45:41.447
27 competitors for the Tour Cyclo-Quebec
have been admitted to hospital.

45:43.762 --> 45:45.197
Milo, what are you doing here?

45:45.317 --> 45:48.003
I was wondering if there was
still time for that physical.

45:48.123 --> 45:48.997
Get in there.

45:49.157 --> 45:53.126
I'm Bob. What do you think
about hyperbaric chambers?

45:53.703 --> 45:57.180
The high oxygen levels
may improve my memory.

45:58.442 --> 45:59.760
Or make it worse.

46:00.251 --> 46:03.179
- Who said it was okay to race?
- This time, the race will not stop.

46:03.388 --> 46:05.822
NorBAC has jurisdiction here.

46:05.942 --> 46:07.161
Not in Quebec.

46:07.281 --> 46:08.892
Nor does Ottawa.

46:09.052 --> 46:11.811
My God! Milo! No, no.
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on!

46:13.224 --> 46:15.649
You want to help him? You help me.
