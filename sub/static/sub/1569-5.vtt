00:08.000 --> 00:09.684
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.760 --> 00:12.366
As of this moment, Howard Stark
is a fugitive from justice.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.010
You're the only one
that can clear my name.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.686
May I introduce you
to Miss Dorothy Underwood?

00:16.760 --> 00:17.841
Oh, call me Dottie.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.810
Return to your room, please.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.122
- What's in the vial?
- Steve Rogers' blood.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.204
- I trusted you, Howard!
- I know, and I was wrong.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.520
Photographer got a shot of the blonde

00:29.600 --> 00:31.125
<i>who was with Spider
before he got killed,</i>

00:31.200 --> 00:32.850
<i>but not one clear shot of her face.</i>

00:32.920 --> 00:34.729
What did the lab rats say
about your magic typewriter?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.290
They're claiming it sends
signals back and forth.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.970
To where, we don't know yet.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.083
She'll never find me here.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.764
And if you let me stay,

01:29.840 --> 01:32.764
I'll keep house for you.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.402
I'll wash and sew and sweep and cook.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.245
What does "ennui" mean?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.560
Uh, it's like melancholy,

02:26.040 --> 02:28.168
um, sadness born out of
tedium or boredom.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.241
- Mmm.
- Why do you ask?

02:29.320 --> 02:30.810
When I knocked on Angie's door
this morning,

02:30.920 --> 02:35.323
she said she was "too consumed
by ennui" to come to work today.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.481
Oh, and to think, her acting teacher said

02:36.560 --> 02:37.561
she wasn't dramatic enough.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.564
Hmm. "Ennui."
Sounds French. Baguette?

02:40.760 --> 02:41.841
Um, no, thank you.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.843
Go on.
I can never finish mine.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.650
- Hey, you got a pen?
- Mmm.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.007
- Do you think I could convince Angie

02:49.080 --> 02:50.764
to come out
and give me a tour of the city?

02:51.080 --> 02:52.844
I still get lost,
but I want to see everything.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.526
And I want to see the best things first.

02:56.960 --> 03:01.522
So, first up, Central Park
and then Empire State Building

03:01.600 --> 03:04.888
and then Trinity Church
and then Statue of Liberty.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.564
What do you think?

03:08.760 --> 03:09.761
Peggy?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.285
- Hello?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.045
Oh, um, tourist traps.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.043
- I'm sorry?
- If you want to get to know New York,

03:15.120 --> 03:16.360
if you want to get to know any place,

03:16.440 --> 03:17.680
you have to start with the people first.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.531
- I talk to people.
- Real people with real jobs.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.286
Not the, uh, phony, superficial
ones that pervade this city.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.290
Uh, you should start with Brooklyn first.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.723
But I...
I'd rather see the Statue of Liberty.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.404
Oh, she'll still be there.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.808
But what she represents,
the spirit of Lady Liberty,

03:33.880 --> 03:35.166
is found in its people.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.401
Wow. You sounded just like
Captain America just now.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.403
- That's no bad thing.
- Hmm.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.687
- Well... Oh, my gosh!
- Oh...

03:43.800 --> 03:45.689
- I am so sorry. I'm such a klutz.
- There's no harm done.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.246
No, no, no. Let me, let me.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.481
Here you go.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.130
Oh, thanks, Peggy.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.205
I'm off to Brooklyn.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.321
How do I get to Brooklyn?

03:58.320 --> 03:59.481
Wait. Don't tell me.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.769
- I will figure it out myself.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.411
I'm sure you will.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.364
Well, have fun, Dottie.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.363
Thanks.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.241
Beautiful morning, huh, Peggy?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.089
- Feels like home.
- Missing England, huh?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.128
- Well, missing something.
- Hmm.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.801
Copy of the <i>Ledger,</i> please.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.564
- Good day, Pete.
- Bye.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.166
Miss Carter, I beg only
one moment of your time.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.321
You've had your moment, Mr. Jarvis.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.401
If you or Howard
have anything else to say,

04:34.480 --> 04:35.561
you can tell it to the Marines.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.608
I tried to persuade Mr. Stark
to tell you the truth.

04:37.680 --> 04:38.761
You could have told me yourself.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.086
Well, given my current situation,

04:40.160 --> 04:41.241
I didn't see how that was possible.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.560
Yes, how could it ever be possible?

04:42.640 --> 04:43.971
How could you ever say,

04:44.040 --> 04:45.963
"Howard Stark wants you to steal
Captain America's blood."

04:46.040 --> 04:47.451
Oh, yes, look. It is possible.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.487
If only it were that simple.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.443
Howard didn't want my help
to prove his innocence.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.210
He wanted a new toy to manipulate.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.327
Miss Carter, you must know

04:53.400 --> 04:55.084
that Mr. Stark
has the greatest admiration.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.885
Only for himself.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.643
He can be thoughtless.
Inconsiderate. Vain,

05:03.040 --> 05:04.963
childish, unreliable, arrogant...

05:05.040 --> 05:06.007
You flatter him.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.003
But he is a good man.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.560
He used me.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.563
He uses you, whether you
choose to see it or not.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.324
He needs your help, Miss Carter.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.289
What he needs is a servant,
and he already has that in you.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.089
And what does the SSR have in you?

05:18.160 --> 05:20.640
I am a federal agent, Mr. Jarvis.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.206
Yes.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.081
Finely trained and skilled
in the art of fetching coffee.

05:26.840 --> 05:27.887
These men you call your colleagues,

05:27.960 --> 05:29.007
they don't respect you.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.411
They don't even see you.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.960
Do you honestly expect
they'll change their minds?

05:33.040 --> 05:35.202
I expect I will make them.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.845
Billy, I got the White House
holding for the chief on line two.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.081
Daniel, what's going on?

05:46.160 --> 05:49.403
Sasha Demidov's magic typewriter
turned itself on all by itself.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.201
What did the message say?

05:51.280 --> 05:52.850
It's encoded. We got a cryptographer

05:52.920 --> 05:54.365
up from Arlington Hall trying to crack it.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.886
He, uh, stinks at his job.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.806
It's clearly not a German cipher,

05:58.960 --> 05:59.927
or the Turing Method would work.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.923
What will work, in your estimation?

06:02.360 --> 06:03.407
Huh?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.562
You already looked
through that book ten times.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.085
I'm gonna have to take this
back with me to Virginia,

06:07.160 --> 06:08.400
- where I can run...
- You're not taking it anywhere.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.687
Look, as difficult as it might
be for you people to understand,

06:10.760 --> 06:12.444
I can't just beat a code into submission

06:12.520 --> 06:13.681
or shoot it with a gun.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.809
Yeah? That works great
with pencil pushers like you.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.325
May I see it?

06:20.120 --> 06:22.282
I saw this at Bletchley.
It's a one-time pad system.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.050
You think I didn't try a pad immediately?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.726
Did you account for the original
message being written in Russian?

06:26.800 --> 06:28.040
Can you read it?

06:28.840 --> 06:30.569
They are map coordinates.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.602
53 degrees, 72 minutes north,

06:35.640 --> 06:39.167
27 degrees, 37 minutes west.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.686
"Purchase confirmed.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.843
"Exchange at 08:00, April 27th."

06:46.880 --> 06:48.291
That's less than two days from now.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.328
Coordinates are in the
Marina Horka forest in Belarus.

06:50.400 --> 06:55.850
"Leviathan... To acquire
prototype... Havoc Reactor."

06:55.920 --> 06:58.048
I'm sorry. Leviathan?

06:58.120 --> 06:59.884
As far as I know, it's
an Old Testament sea monster,

06:59.960 --> 07:01.291
who types, apparently.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.569
No. It's a covert Russian
organization, supposedly.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.968
I always just assumed
it was a spook story.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.451
Rumors had it, after the war,

07:08.520 --> 07:10.841
their group wanted to purchase
weapons to fight the Allies.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.688
Well, if they're real
and she's reading that right...

07:13.760 --> 07:16.127
She is trying to concentrate, thank you.

07:16.400 --> 07:22.442
"Payment of... $100,000 American...

07:23.400 --> 07:24.890
"Upon delivery...

07:25.680 --> 07:28.251
"Payable to...

07:29.520 --> 07:30.931
"Howard Stark."

07:31.720 --> 07:32.721
Hot damn, we got him.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.041
We got Stark red-handed
selling weapons to the Russians.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.646
Take a team to Belarus.
Find Stark, bring him home.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.449
Li, Ramirez, gear up.
You're going to Russia.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.961
- Li, Ramirez, and Carter.
- Come again?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.644
There's no one more qualified
for this mission, sir.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.849
I am going to Russia.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.367
Chief, we're not having
a knitting circle.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.566
I invite you to look
at my war records, sir.

07:51.640 --> 07:52.801
This is the real deal.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.564
Stop! In my office.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.484
Are you really considering
letting Carter come?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.561
What did I just say?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.484
Chances are Leviathan will
continue to communicate in code,

08:01.800 --> 08:04.326
which means that the team needs
my skills as a code breaker.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.447
Assuming that it is Leviathan,

08:05.520 --> 08:07.170
we have no idea who's at the
other end of that typewriter.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.641
All the more reason not to saddle me
and my guys with babysitting her.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.687
Would you prefer to have

08:10.800 --> 08:11.801
- a nanny wipe your noses?
- I might.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.251
Enough.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.644
It's your team, Thompson.
What do you want?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.763
Look.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.840
It's great that Carter cracked the code.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.445
I am proud of her. I am.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.441
But we have no idea what we're
getting into over there, okay?

08:24.520 --> 08:26.488
I don't need brains.
I need brawn. I need...

08:26.560 --> 08:27.925
You need someone
who speaks the language

08:28.000 --> 08:29.490
- and understands the region.
- Ramirez speaks Russian.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.130
I spent three years in the mud
of the European theater,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.407
the Eastern front, the Western front,
and everything in between.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.164
Yeah, surrounded by
some of our best men.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.687
Agent Thompson, do you know what
the smell of herring in the air

08:37.760 --> 08:38.885
means in the middle
of a Belorussian summer?

08:39.120 --> 08:40.884
Hmm. Someone's having a fish fry.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.928
It means there is wind
blowing in from the Baltic.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.691
It means a snow storm in July,
and if you can smell the wind,

08:45.760 --> 08:48.206
it means you have 30 minutes
to find shelter and build a fire

08:48.280 --> 08:49.850
before you die of hypothermia
in the morning.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.968
I know all of this
because I've been there.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.644
Now I know, too.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.810
Look, put yourself in my shoes, Carter.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.570
I send you on this mission,
you get yourself killed,

09:03.640 --> 09:06.041
I'm the moron who
got a woman killed in action.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.767
I send you and one of my guys buys it,

09:08.840 --> 09:10.683
I'm the one who set him up to die.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.806
I know you've spent time in Russia,

09:13.480 --> 09:15.403
but we're putting together
a European tac team

09:15.480 --> 09:16.606
that knows the terrain.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.729
Not like I do.
Not like the 107th regiment.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.087
The Europeans don't even know
Europe as well as the 107th.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.003
You think I wouldn't
snatch them up if I could?

09:24.080 --> 09:25.411
What would you say
if I could deliver them?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.369
I'd say, "Pack your bags,"
but that's not gonna happen.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.361
I'm gonna miss her.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.081
I mean, come on, chief,

09:34.160 --> 09:35.844
you're not actually thinking
about letting Carter go to...

09:35.920 --> 09:39.925
Son, I like you,
but I'm running an office here.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.569
I got the vice president
of the United States

09:42.640 --> 09:43.846
calling me at home,

09:43.920 --> 09:45.843
asking me when I'm gonna
deliver him Howard Stark.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.931
At the same time,
I got a Nazi war criminal

09:49.000 --> 09:51.207
telling me Stark's involved
in a massacre.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.562
I'm trying to run an investigation here,

09:53.920 --> 09:55.649
and I don't have time on my docket

09:55.920 --> 09:57.604
for your little crush on Carter.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.365
Yes, sir.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.931
Okay, uh, I'm thinking
we fly the team over there,

10:05.040 --> 10:06.963
we land on the Polish side
of the Russian border,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.611
we meet the tac team there,
okay? Then...

10:09.680 --> 10:10.761
The 107th will meet us

10:10.880 --> 10:12.689
at the Polish side of the Russian border.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.809
That is the plan, isn't it?
It is the most obvious one.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.770
Gear up. You roll out in an hour.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.045
That's all.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.364
Carter, if you're looking for
a peep show, try Times Square.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.169
This is the only
changing room in the SSR.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.322
- I need to change.
- Try the ladies' room.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.006
The ladies' room is downstairs
in the lobby of the ad agency.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.562
I'd much rather suffer the musk
of a men's locker room

10:50.640 --> 10:51.801
than have to change into tactical gear

10:51.920 --> 10:53.331
in a public restroom.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.571
Pull up your skirts, boys.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.641
Whoa!

10:56.760 --> 10:58.649
Geez, Carter, give a guy some warning.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.127
Oh, such fuss.
Do none of you have sisters?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.565
They don't look like you.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.081
Come on, congratulate the lady.
She's on the team.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.243
Jack, you really think
that's a good idea?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.526
Not my call.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.601
We can't be responsible for a woman...

11:10.680 --> 11:11.966
Let me know if you want to stay home.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.088
I got six guys out there
who'd love to take your place.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.922
Oh, this is new.
It's lighter than it looks.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.081
Yep.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.563
Lab boys just dropped it off.
It's 10% titanium alloy.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.486
Although, I don't think
they had 38-22-38 in mind

11:26.560 --> 11:27.527
when they designed it.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.125
Math isn't your forte,
is it, Agent Thompson?

11:29.200 --> 11:30.611
Or is that just words in general?

11:30.680 --> 11:32.011
That's "Words in general, sir."

11:32.280 --> 11:35.204
Yes, sir, Lieutenant junior grade, sir.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.203
Guess you're used to serving
under a captain, huh?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.362
Just not used to serving with boys.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.885
Field report.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.682
Maps, weather, charts, all known
bogey dope for the area,

11:44.960 --> 11:46.291
dossier files on the tac team,

11:46.760 --> 11:49.047
though Carter's pretty much
all the intel you need on them.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.044
Thorough as ever, Sousa.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.006
Oh! Compass, compass.
Almost forgot my compass.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.048
Uh, locker 42.
Would you grab that for me, pal?

11:59.360 --> 12:00.486
- Bloody nora!
- Whoa, nelly!

12:01.960 --> 12:04.167
- Uh, you're... Uh...
- Yes, everything's fine.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.480
Found it!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.240
You don't have to worry about it, Sousa.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.369
Is there anything else, Daniel?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.761
- Uh...
- Uh?

12:12.080 --> 12:14.082
- No.
-"No"? Yes?

12:14.160 --> 12:16.925
- Have a swell trip.
- Right. Thank you.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.008
Relax. You'll sprain something.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.320
It's just as you remember it.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.687
You a mind reader,

12:36.760 --> 12:38.922
or is that your woman's
intuition speaking?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.081
How's this for woman's intuition,

12:40.160 --> 12:41.605
this is your first jump, isn't it?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.051
Ninth.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.611
Eight training jumps.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.602
You've infiltrated
hostile territory before.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.489
You'll be fine. Just follow our lead.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.324
Thanks, Carter,
but I already have a mother.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.640
<i>Prepare for drop.</i>

12:55.760 --> 12:57.967
What I need right now are soldiers.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.927
- Let's go, boys! It's go time!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.240
The drop will put us 10 kilometers

13:02.320 --> 13:04.049
from our rendezvous with our tac team,

13:04.120 --> 13:06.043
assuming they're
where they're supposed to be.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.726
- They'll be there.
- They better be.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.088
We're eight klicks east of the RV.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.961
I'll take lead. Carter, you're in back.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.929
Stay tight.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.681
Don't move.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.245
Emu.

13:39.800 --> 13:40.847
What?

13:40.920 --> 13:42.604
"Ostrich," man. "Ostrich."

13:42.720 --> 13:44.085
Shut up. Emu.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.166
Carter, Dugan forgot
the password again.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.242
Password is "Eagle," you apes.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.403
Oh, hi, Peggy. Fellas.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.727
Thompson, that's Dum-Dum Dugan.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.370
Jack Thompson, Mike Li, Rick Ramirez,

13:57.480 --> 14:00.768
this is Junior Juniper, Pinky Pinkerton,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.241
Happy Sam Sawyer. You seem
to know Dum-Dum Dugan.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.641
The 107th, our tactical team.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.131
You guys are the Howling Commandos.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.686
- Yeah, I hate that name.
- I came up with that name.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.000
That you did.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.441
Dugan, you fought side-by-side
with Captain America, didn't you?

14:13.920 --> 14:17.003
Yeah. But not as long as she did.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.040
Agent Jack Thompson.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.406
I'm running point for the SSR.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.686
We head due east till we hit the border.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.728
We'll hit a wall of reds
before we reach the border.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.491
Let's head up into Lithuania,

14:26.560 --> 14:28.244
cross over into Russia at Ashmyany.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.322
You planning on walking
halfway across Lithuania?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.641
Well, you can if you want.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.321
But me? I'm taking these.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.005
Peggy, let's go.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.641
Did you bring what I asked for?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.570
From my own private stash.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.241
Oh. Attagirl.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.723
See, the Germans are geniuses
when it comes to beer,

15:05.400 --> 15:09.007
but no one knows bourbon
like the US of A.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.244
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.923
All right, so, tell me,

15:22.280 --> 15:24.965
what's the story with Stark
and these Leviathan jerks?

15:25.040 --> 15:27.008
The SSR is convinced
that Howard is trying

15:27.080 --> 15:29.606
to sell technology to enemies
of the United States.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.923
They think Leviathan
is a potential buyer.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.162
- And you disagree?
- Howard isn't selling weapons

15:34.240 --> 15:36.129
to adversaries of the United States,

15:36.200 --> 15:38.282
not to Leviathan, not to anybody.

15:38.360 --> 15:42.126
He may be an utter wanker,
but he is one of us.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.329
So you think the whole deal is
a trap. It's always a damn trap.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.731
That's why we bring the guns.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.448
Question is, if Leviathan is trying

15:49.520 --> 15:51.727
to lure us in with promises
of capturing Howard,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.768
then what is it that they really want?

15:53.840 --> 15:56.730
Maybe it's just the pleasure
of your company.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.491
Hey!

16:00.320 --> 16:01.287
You smell bad enough.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.566
And you used to be fun.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.130
Yeah, once upon a time.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.602
Yeah.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.125
I miss him, too.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.289
Don't you have a life?

16:22.320 --> 16:23.765
I'm an SSR agent, sir.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.410
My job is my life.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.160
What are you still doing here?

16:28.240 --> 16:30.322
I'm meeting a friend for a drink.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.162
Figured if I went home,
wife might not let me out again.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.841
Women, right?

16:36.920 --> 16:38.649
- Women.
- Good night.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.684
- Thanks, Yauch.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.327
Hey, go easy
on those beans, okay?

17:33.840 --> 17:35.171
Coast is clear.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.691
Li and Ramirez are on the night watch.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.001
We should be good to go at first light.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.607
Which means we stand relieved.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.603
You see any abominable snowmen
like the one in Tibet?

17:43.840 --> 17:46.002
Uh, I never said,
"Abominable snowman."

17:46.080 --> 17:48.003
In fairness, he did specify "yeti."

17:48.360 --> 17:49.407
- Yeah.
- Sorry, it was a little hard

17:49.480 --> 17:50.527
to make out words

17:50.600 --> 17:51.647
in between all the sobbing.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.843
- Shut up. It was scary.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.521
So, what is the difference

17:56.600 --> 17:58.602
between a yeti
and an abominable snowman?

17:58.720 --> 18:00.210
One's real and one isn't.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.484
- What?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.482
So, I hear they have, uh,
mermaids in Japan.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.164
You see any of them
when you were out there?

18:07.240 --> 18:09.322
Yeah, story time.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.851
I got nothing you guys
ain't heard before.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.008
Did a lot of grunt work,
dug a lot of trenches.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.845
They don't give out Navy Crosses
just for digging trenches.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.165
Navy cross.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.321
Hmm.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.887
All right.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.488
1945. Tsuken Island.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.891
Nothing detail.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.248
I fall asleep on the night shift.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.566
I wake up. Six Japanese
soldiers walking into my camp,

18:47.600 --> 18:49.568
just waltzing in, in the dark.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.964
One of them bends down
over my sleeping CO.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.564
One more second,
he'd have slit his throat.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.481
Snapped to.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.566
Shoot him in the back.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.408
Shoot 'em all,

19:13.960 --> 19:17.123
before they even knew I was there.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.766
Before my last man was even awake.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.243
Truth be told, I like
the kid's yeti story better.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.122
What are you,
a history buff now?

19:53.800 --> 19:56.610
Something like that.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.441
Anything you can tell me
about the Battle of Finow,

19:59.800 --> 20:02.121
anything I don't already know,
buys you a scotch.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.930
Two hundred and forty-seven
dead Russians, massacred

20:09.000 --> 20:12.482
in a battle no one will take credit for.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.641
Where's my drink?

20:14.920 --> 20:15.967
That one I knew.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.646
- Cheap does not become you, Rog.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.281
Scotch for my friend.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.486
Coming up.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.802
I wrote a piece on it for the <i>Times.</i>

20:24.360 --> 20:26.966
Should have won
a Pulitzer Prize for it, too.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.561
How did I not read that one?

20:28.640 --> 20:31.849
Ah, my editor killed it.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.084
Got scared. I guess that's what happens

20:34.160 --> 20:35.446
when you implicate the army

20:35.520 --> 20:38.683
and Howard Stark
in a Russian cover-up.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.405
What's Stark got to do with Finow?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.085
He was there for the, uh,
clean up of the massacre.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.887
The guy in charge wasn't
too thrilled about it, either.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.810
General. One star.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.530
McGinnis?

20:55.920 --> 20:57.160
Died of a heart attack a month ago.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.526
That's him.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.521
Stark took a swing at him
right there in front of his men.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.122
You'd think a guy as smart as Stark

21:04.240 --> 21:06.846
wouldn't, uh, hit someone twice his size.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.686
- Even Gandhi's got a sensitive spot.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.209
Tell him his kids are ugly
and see what happens.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.563
What do you think Stark's was?

21:15.640 --> 21:18.530
All I know is McGinnis
wiped the floor with him.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.601
Mmm-hmm.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.887
Then resigned a week later.

21:22.320 --> 21:24.641
A week after that, Stark walks away

21:24.760 --> 21:28.321
from a seven-figure
R&D contract with the army,

21:28.400 --> 21:30.721
and cuts all ties with them.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.046
And now Stark
is public enemy number one.

21:36.520 --> 21:40.411
Yeah, we're not railroading him.
We got evidence.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.721
Yeah, what you don't have
is the whole story.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.768
Somebody does,

21:46.240 --> 21:49.608
but they're keeping it to themselves.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.842
Well, not for long.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.646
Looks like we beat the bad guys here.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.811
So we could have slept
for another hour?

22:07.880 --> 22:09.325
Well, then we wouldn't
have the advantage of surprise,

22:09.400 --> 22:10.811
would we, Timothy?

22:10.880 --> 22:14.930
So, we infiltrate in four teams
of two. You, you, you, us.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.447
No weapons discharge
unless absolutely necessary.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.729
Meet on the ground floor in 30. Clear?

22:21.800 --> 22:24.690
- Carter?
- Agent Thompson's lead.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.964
You got a better idea? Let's hear it.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.168
Four teams of two is faster.
Two teams of four is safer.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.651
Discretion seems to be
the order of the day.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.290
We don't know what we're walking into.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.485
Okay. You four.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.962
Happy Sam, Pinkerton, Ramirez,
you're with me. Good?

22:41.200 --> 22:42.690
Aces.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.166
Does anybody else feel a chill
going up their knickers?

23:23.560 --> 23:25.210
I would if I wore knickers.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.803
- Oh, sorry.
- Shut that thing off.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.360
- Wait.
<i>- Help!</i>

23:34.680 --> 23:36.364
<i>Help! Help!</i>

23:36.760 --> 23:38.046
<i>Help!</i>

23:42.120 --> 23:44.521
"Instill..."

23:47.640 --> 23:49.165
"...fear."

23:49.280 --> 23:51.248
Really regretting
a lack of knickers right now.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.044
There's a little kid crying.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.010
What's a little kid doing in this place?

23:57.680 --> 23:59.091
Careful.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.246
Little kid beds?

24:06.600 --> 24:07.681
It's a boarding school.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.883
Why are there shackles on the beds?

24:09.960 --> 24:12.247
- It's Russia, man.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.560
Peggy.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.121
Hey, there.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.365
You okay?

24:24.760 --> 24:26.649
It's all right.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.404
We're here to help.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.890
It's all right. We're not here to hurt you.

24:41.720 --> 24:42.960
Oh, my hat?

24:43.040 --> 24:45.407
You like my hat?

24:45.960 --> 24:47.689
It's called a bowler hat.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.367
The reason they call it that is because...

24:51.440 --> 24:53.966
Why do they call it a bowler, Peggy?

25:14.800 --> 25:15.881
Dugan, she's just a little girl.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.166
She's anything but that.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.522
Dugan, no!

25:19.680 --> 25:22.445
- You all right?

25:22.720 --> 25:25.451
Yeah. The vest took the brunt of it.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.721
What happened?

25:27.800 --> 25:28.801
There's a good chance

25:28.960 --> 25:30.769
Leviathan has been alerted
to our presence.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.371
We've come too far to turn back now.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.965
We need to move. Quickly.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.765
We're gonna need an exit out the back.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.808
We can't leave until
we know who's setting Howard up.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.123
Dugan, Pinky, Ramirez,
find a back way out of here.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.322
The rest, come with me.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.209
Till next week.
Send my love to your wife.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.727
You don't ever alter
your routine, do you?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.246
Are you here to threaten me
with deportation again?

26:10.320 --> 26:12.687
Or, wonder of wonders,
have you come to apologize?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.086
Something I need to tell you.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.849
The words you're looking for
are "I'm" and "sorry."

26:18.920 --> 26:20.888
Your boss has a lot of enemies.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.440
I'll alert Edward R. Murrow.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.603
One of them was a US army
general named John McGinnis.

26:26.640 --> 26:27.607
They got into a fistfight

26:27.680 --> 26:30.001
on a European battlefield
in the spring of '44.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.525
That ring a bell?

26:37.520 --> 26:41.684
I remember a time not long ago...

26:43.600 --> 26:46.444
A time when you said you
were here to tell me something.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.203
It's my one and only question.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.086
I've never heard of this general

26:56.160 --> 26:58.162
or any fistfight
on any European battlefield.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.321
Your turn.

27:02.040 --> 27:05.123
There are three sides
to every story, Mr. Jarvis,

27:05.200 --> 27:08.966
your side, my side, and the truth.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.770
Tell Stark I'm not interested
in any witch hunt.

27:12.320 --> 27:14.084
I just want to get to the truth.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.762
If he's willing to tell
his side of the story,

27:16.840 --> 27:19.002
I'd really like to hear it.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.491
I can be reached at this number
24 hours a day.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.850
Stay dry.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.250
Sawyer, stay here. Keep an eye out.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.921
Rest of you are with me.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.125
Clear.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.444
You are not Leviathan.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.291
Who are you?

28:02.360 --> 28:04.442
We're the good guys.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.481
Hello.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.724
I'm Peggy Carter.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.729
Why is Leviathan holding you prisoner?

30:52.800 --> 30:54.768
They acquired some schemata
in the black market,

30:55.640 --> 30:57.404
a weapon they don't know how to build.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.489
They want us to build it for them.

30:59.560 --> 31:00.721
So you're engineers?

31:01.480 --> 31:02.720
He is the engineer.

31:03.120 --> 31:07.330
I serve as Nikola's...
...psychiatrist.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.724
So the reds locked up a head doctor

31:10.120 --> 31:11.963
and a mad scientist to build a bomb.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.964
- Sure, why not?
- He is not mad.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.840
He is burdened.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.681
Look, he sees things in dimensions

31:19.760 --> 31:21.046
that we can only imagine.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.406
You look at a field of grass,
you see pretty picture.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.370
He sees biology, phytochemistry.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.205
Keeping his gifts
from overwhelming him,

31:30.280 --> 31:33.204
this requires discipline, stability.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.207
Since Leviathan took his family,
stability does not come easy.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.487
I provide the discipline he needs.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.562
This weapon Leviathan wants
you to build, what is it?

31:41.640 --> 31:43.165
Oh, it's beautiful.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.322
It's a photonic amplifier.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.768
Okay, you understand light
is both particles and waves?

31:50.880 --> 31:52.086
Hmm.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.800
Mr. Stark has found a way

31:54.040 --> 31:56.088
of altering the behavior of the waves.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.886
- Stark.
- Yeah. Of course.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.405
It's his design right here.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.601
Is Howard Stark here?

32:00.680 --> 32:03.729
Hmm? No, of course not!
They stole the schemata!

32:04.160 --> 32:05.161
I mean, if he was here,

32:05.240 --> 32:07.368
the Leviathan
would have no need for me.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.250
If he was here,
I would be in Kiev with my wife!

32:10.320 --> 32:11.765
Kolya, Kolya.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.884
You thought you would find
Howard Stark here?

32:13.960 --> 32:15.450
That's why you came?

32:15.520 --> 32:18.171
I have heard no mention of
Stark himself from our captors.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.691
Only the work.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.121
Incoming!

32:21.200 --> 32:22.690
Please! Please!

32:22.760 --> 32:23.841
- Back away.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.247
Go! Now!

32:29.320 --> 32:30.481
Move out!

32:40.200 --> 32:42.009
- Go, go, go!

32:43.040 --> 32:45.042
Dugan, we're in the boiler room.
We need an exit.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.327
Gentlemen, if you know the way

32:55.400 --> 32:57.050
out of this facility,
now's the time to share it.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.640
Yeah, use your big brain and get us...

32:59.720 --> 33:02.087
- Li!
- Above you!

33:03.120 --> 33:04.451
Clear!

33:11.400 --> 33:14.244
I know what to do. I know what to do.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.290
What is he saying? Is it bad?

33:27.400 --> 33:29.209
It's bad, isn't it?

33:31.040 --> 33:33.327
Doctor, this is not the answer.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.286
We will not be your leverage.
We will die before we are captured.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.362
Nikola, listen to me.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.402
I want you to focus
on the sound of my voice.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.442
Are you listening, Nikola?

33:55.240 --> 33:58.050
Then listen to me! You've got one
chance of getting out of here alive,

33:58.120 --> 33:59.246
and it's because of our good graces!

33:59.320 --> 34:00.367
You kill our friend,

34:00.440 --> 34:02.124
and you will die at our hand instantly!

34:02.200 --> 34:03.645
So you have until the count of three

34:03.720 --> 34:06.246
to put down your weapon
and fall to your knees! One!

34:08.400 --> 34:10.289
I am sorry, Nikola.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.129
Dugan, where the hell is my exit?

34:15.239 --> 34:16.400
Out of ammo!

34:16.480 --> 34:18.208
Thompson, Li's ammo pack.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.964
Thompson!

34:21.719 --> 34:22.801
Lieutenant.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.688
Dugan, I'm about to get
very cross with you.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.730
Wah-hoo!

34:45.800 --> 34:46.926
Stop "wah-hooing" and help.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.081
Look at this mess.
We were only gone five minutes.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.650
Everybody out!

34:53.239 --> 34:55.129
Go! Go! Go!

34:55.560 --> 34:57.130
Thompson, I said everybody!

35:00.000 --> 35:01.206
Thompson!

35:05.280 --> 35:07.681
Snap out of it, mate. Come on.
Get your arse into gear.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.686
I'm up. I'm up.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.211
Peggy, go, go!

35:18.320 --> 35:19.287
You go!

35:19.360 --> 35:21.727
What would Cap say
if I left his best girl behind?

35:21.800 --> 35:23.370
He would say, "Do as Peggy says."

35:33.520 --> 35:34.567
Run. Peggy! Run!

35:36.640 --> 35:38.449
Don't look behind! Let's go!

35:40.360 --> 35:42.044
Go, go, go, go!

35:52.000 --> 35:54.731
Not bad... For a girl.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.091
I hate you all.

36:02.680 --> 36:03.681
Good luck.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.605
Thank you.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.921
- Ramirez.
- It was an honor.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.171
You sure you want to get on that plane?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.322
Commandos can always use
another good fighter.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.169
We just need to come up
with a nickname for you.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.321
Tempting, but I think it's time

36:17.400 --> 36:19.448
I put my days
on the front lines behind me.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.921
Someone needs to mind the wheel
back in the States.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.411
And I suppose someone
needs to convince the SSR

36:23.480 --> 36:25.528
of Howard's innocence, wanker or not.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.001
I'll miss you.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.851
Miss you, too, Peggy.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.685
Wait a second.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.003
Miss "U". Miss Union Jack.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.003
What do you think, fellas? Huh?

36:37.400 --> 36:38.447
Never speak again.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.007
Okay. And, Doc, what about you?

36:41.320 --> 36:42.481
Need a ride home?

36:42.560 --> 36:44.369
I do not know where is home anymore.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.726
What do you think of New York?

36:46.120 --> 36:48.282
The SSR could use your help
fighting Leviathan.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.164
I'll do anything I can.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.322
We'll keep Europe in one piece.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.771
- Doc.
- Huh?

36:55.280 --> 36:56.441
Pleasure.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.409
Oh. You wouldn't have any vodka?

37:00.440 --> 37:03.171
Desperate times, I suppose.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.285
This is terrible.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.249
Might I have the rest?

37:11.320 --> 37:12.606
It's all yours.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.404
Doc.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.410
Bye-bye, bourbon.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.326
You all right?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.006
Yeah.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.325
You saved a lot of necks back there.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.126
You saved mine.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.921
Not bad for a code breaker.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.801
Pretty bad for the Navy Cross winner.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.441
Everybody freezes sometimes.
You recovered.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.204
That's the most important thing.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.609
They were carrying a white flag.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.965
The soldiers that came
into my camp in Okinawa...

38:09.520 --> 38:11.727
The ones I killed.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.563
They were coming to surrender.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.561
I just didn't realize it
until it was too late.

38:30.400 --> 38:36.089
I buried the flag
before anyone else saw it.

38:42.520 --> 38:46.605
Everybody thinks that
I'm this guy that I never was.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.922
And every day,

38:52.000 --> 38:56.289
it gets harder and harder to live with.

39:10.920 --> 39:16.165
I've been trying to tell that story

39:16.240 --> 39:19.164
since I came home from war.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.967
You just did.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.961
Agent Li died honorably in action.

40:13.440 --> 40:15.249
It's my sworn duty
as his commanding officer

40:15.320 --> 40:18.051
to deliver the condolences of
the United States to his family.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.566
No Stark, no Leviathan.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.485
No, sir.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.009
But Agent Carter was able to
acquire intel about Leviathan

40:26.080 --> 40:29.368
from Dr. Ivchenko, about
the enemy's possible end game.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.963
We were able to retrieve him
from a Leviathan prison.

40:33.960 --> 40:37.203
He's very eager to cooperate
with the SSR in any way he can.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.203
But he doesn't think Stark's
connected to the Leviathan?

40:39.280 --> 40:41.487
No. And I don't, either.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.204
Noted.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.524
He may not have all the information, sir.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.122
He was working off Stark blueprints.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.523
Smart money says that Leviathan

40:53.600 --> 40:55.090
got them directly from Stark himself.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.250
Send the doctor in on your way out.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.725
Good work, Carter.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.722
Thanks, sir.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.087
How is it that you're the one

41:23.160 --> 41:24.571
who looks like
he hasn't slept for two days?

41:25.440 --> 41:28.284
Just staying up late,
worrying about you guys.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.521
You did good.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.806
Thanks, Daniel.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.008
Sousa, you coming?

41:34.760 --> 41:36.842
You can buy me a drink
for every red I killed.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.287
Not tonight, Jack. Pillow's calling.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.488
Ah. Come on, Carter.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.206
I owe you a bourbon.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.931
I'll be right there.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.328
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

41:57.920 --> 42:00.161
Some other time. Thanks.

42:00.960 --> 42:04.169
Right. Well, goodnight.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.890
- Night.
