00:03.520 --> 00:06.876
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:06.960 --> 00:11.670
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of the lives

00:11.760 --> 00:15.116
they were given by him upstairs

00:15.200 --> 00:18.431
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.229
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.320 --> 00:24.914
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.958
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.040 --> 00:32.033
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented

00:32.119 --> 00:36.989
to calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.039
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.120 --> 00:45.750
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.913
You shit on our heads,
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.517
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.600 --> 00:59.034
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.796
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:03.880 --> 01:07.839
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:07.920 --> 01:09.114
FRANK LAUGHS

01:09.200 --> 01:11.509

SHOUTING AND CHEERING

01:23.480 --> 01:25.357
CHEERING

01:26.560 --> 01:28.676
FRANK GROANS
Oh, shit!

01:28.760 --> 01:30.910
2-2, and under a minute to go.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.310
- For God's sake!
- Ref, I need to get a sub on.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.595
- Who are they?
- Carl Gallagher and your Micky.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.077
I can't see either of them, can you?

01:41.640 --> 01:43.949
I am Carl Gallagher.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.632
Is this right?

01:46.720 --> 01:47.994
Er... yeah.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.277
Sorry, Carl. Didn't recognise you there,
what with your new hairdo.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.157
(Referee) Where are your shorts,
your boots?

01:54.320 --> 01:58.074
Did Zola Budd need
the assumed appropriate footwear?

01:59.160 --> 02:02.072
<i>(Jamie) All sons start out
idolising their dad.</i>

02:02.160 --> 02:03.991
WHISTLE BLOWS

02:05.080 --> 02:08.116
<i>He's the strongest, funniest,
cleverest man you know.</i>

02:08.199 --> 02:09.792
- Come on, Dad!
- Go on!

02:16.840 --> 02:18.034
Get in!

02:20.400 --> 02:25.315
<i>You follow in his footsteps, hoping
one day you'll be half the man he is.</i>

02:25.400 --> 02:27.914
Yeah! Yeah!

02:32.120 --> 02:34.839
<i>But as you grow,
you begin to see his flaws.</i>

02:37.440 --> 02:41.194
<i>And then one day, you notice
he's no longer out in front.</i>

02:41.280 --> 02:42.599
I only bought this Saturday.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.593
<i>You turn around and there he is,
staggering behind,</i>

02:46.680 --> 02:49.069
<i>his weakness there for all to see.</i>

02:49.160 --> 02:51.469
I'll run and fetch you another one.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.519
<i>And so the son
becomes father to the man.</i>

02:55.600 --> 02:57.670
And get some shoe polish.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.150
I want you looking crisp
for Wednesday's meeting.

03:01.240 --> 03:05.552
Harry Stout -
the new-build security contract.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.599
<i>Only polite we let the fawning
old fart lick clean boots.</i>

03:16.560 --> 03:19.154
Joe went to see
his solicitor this morning.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.595
Should be shot of The Jockey
by the weekend.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.079
Yeah?

03:23.160 --> 03:25.549
Just days till Mr Flash
gets his mÃ©nage a trois sorted.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.236
What are you gonna do with the money?

03:31.320 --> 03:34.232
See as much of the world
as me licence will let me.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.436
Don't go blowing it, acting the playboy.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.318
As if. I'll keep 30 back
for a franchise.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.198
Thought you'd had your fill
of running pubs.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.998
I haven't got many options, Mand.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.230
It's either run me own business
or work for Dad.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.033
And what in the world
would draw me back to that?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.434
Good on ya.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.158
Spuds.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.557
SHE SCREAMS

04:09.360 --> 04:11.828
Jesus, Mand!
What's with all the bruises?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.433
It's not what you think.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.793
Did he do this?

04:22.680 --> 04:25.433
- I'm supposed to believe that?
- Nice one, Frank.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.112
Very kind of you, my mate.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.795
But Carl, son, if you're down as sub,
you ought to show up.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.757
Where's your sense of comradeship?

04:32.840 --> 04:35.673
It's the new job - early mornings.
I'm totally shagged out.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.512
LAUGHING

04:37.600 --> 04:40.273
And I bet the bored housewives
don't help either.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.239
- (Men) Whoa!
- I'll make this easy for ya.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.709
You either walk out that door now
and disappear

04:46.800 --> 04:49.030
or I will disappear you.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.396
HE CHUCKLES

05:01.480 --> 05:04.438
Fuck me, mate. I am never gonna
get your sense of humour, am I?

05:04.520 --> 05:08.593
So I object to you battering my sister.
Is that a joke to you?

05:09.640 --> 05:11.835
Mate, you've not been well.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.319
If you think I'd ever hit a woman,

05:13.400 --> 05:15.356
your reasoning's
as off-target as your football.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.432
- She's covered in bruises!
- She's not covered.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.269
All right, fair do. She's marked.
I don't like it either.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.920
Bang into S&M, she is.
Not really my thing.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.036
But the kinky cow
won't stop demanding.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.271
I'm just trying to keep your
kid sister satisfied, my mate.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.757
No sparring in here.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.229
The emulsion's barely dried.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.633
Outside.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.830
Fight! Fight!

05:51.920 --> 05:53.319
Come on, man!

05:55.160 --> 05:56.798
Fucking...

05:57.880 --> 05:59.359
Jamie!

06:02.720 --> 06:05.393
This has nothing to do with you!

06:12.080 --> 06:14.150
There's a pulse.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.872
What if he's dead?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.679
Might be the best thing.
Can't squeal then.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.479
If it comes to manslaughter,
someone will talk.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.959
He'd be nearly 40 before he was out!

06:32.040 --> 06:34.634
Over my dead body
is that lad going back inside.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.915
Go and get yourself cleaned up.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.911
One of us will take the rap.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.560
You mean confess? Go on remand?

06:42.640 --> 06:44.915
And it can't be your father.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.479
Why not?
SHE SNORTS

06:48.320 --> 06:51.198
Well, I've no previous.
Maybe I should confess.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.840
And it can't be Shane.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.793
He's just got over a bleeding stroke.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.358
Why should he go down for eight years
just cos Mandy's got shit taste in men?

07:03.440 --> 07:05.954
You gonna let Anytime Annie
do your talking for ya?

07:06.040 --> 07:09.999
Look, if I thought it'd go with
Section 20, I might think about it.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.389
- But there's...
- Yes. He is.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.311
Well, like I just said. I don't mind.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.356
Stop your bleating, Micky -
a doe-eyed waif like you

07:16.440 --> 07:19.193
would be passed from man to man
like dysentery in a death camp!

07:19.280 --> 07:21.236
Is that what you want?!

07:39.240 --> 07:40.798
So I did it, then.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.199
I took him out.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.277
You selfish fucking prick of a fuck!

07:46.360 --> 07:48.476
We've no time for that, Paddy.

07:48.560 --> 07:52.394
I've got all my babies. A mam's
gotta do what a mam's gotta do.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.397
<i>If we can all agree</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:04.314
that Mimi Maguire fixed that
spineless piece of shit over there,

08:04.400 --> 08:07.915
then once the police have pissed off,
there's free drinks inside until dawn.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.911
MURMURING AGREEMENT

08:10.000 --> 08:11.956
- So who did it?
- (All) Mimi.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.190
- (Man) Yeah, I saw her.
- You absolutely sure about that?

08:14.280 --> 08:15.679
(All) Yeah.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.993
Did you hear that, Mand?

08:20.080 --> 08:21.479
Mand?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.710
We're saying Mam did it, right?

08:25.800 --> 08:28.792
SIREN WAILING

08:35.760 --> 08:37.352
HE EXHALES

08:48.960 --> 08:51.428
Whatever this throws up,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.750
you mustn't blame yourself.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.751
Did you know?

08:55.840 --> 08:57.592
Thought there might be summat.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.749
So you did.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.479
So I've you to blame.

09:04.560 --> 09:07.199
What a shabby excuse
for a friend you are.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.633
SHE GROANS

09:35.720 --> 09:38.632
Right. That's the phone,
then, princess.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.756
You ready for the charger?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.472
Mam, the...

09:46.240 --> 09:47.753
Go on, on your way.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.989
Look, we can still see each other.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.877
I deserve better.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.996
I deserve fucking better.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.357
Day two of my transfer and I'm
already mopping up a Maguire mess.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.194
Well, yeah. Me... Me mam's
little punch-up went a bit OTT.

10:16.280 --> 10:20.114
I'll tell you what went a bit OTT,
Micky - the witness statements.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.156
He got a right bead on.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.310
Right, so she leads in
with an arm-breaker...

10:24.400 --> 10:25.879
He started to leg it...

10:25.960 --> 10:27.996
...then atomic-drops him to the floor.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.709
But when he opened the door,
who was standing there? Mimi.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.792
I mean, from there, they tumbled out,
doing a flying mare.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.677
She put her hands round his throat...

10:36.760 --> 10:38.637
He was crushed between
her smothering thighs.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.792
...and said, "I hope your last meal
was a good 'un

10:41.880 --> 10:44.030
"cos tonight, la', you die!"

10:44.120 --> 10:46.918
There's no way the lumpy old effort
you call Mam

10:47.000 --> 10:49.878
- could take out a strong, virile man.
- Well, she's...

10:49.960 --> 10:52.030
Oi, I don't mind crims
attempting to cover up,

10:52.120 --> 10:54.270
it just hurts when
they're being so lazy about it.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.713
It insults my intelligence.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.840
Now, where will I find Jamie Maguire?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.353
Oh, please, Ady...

11:02.440 --> 11:06.069
Don't go being a big jobsworth
just cos I dumped ya.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.515
Can't you just accept
that me mam did it?

11:10.280 --> 11:12.157
Look, you can have anything you want.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.516
Money. A nice new kitchen. Holiday!

11:15.600 --> 11:16.999
I'm not interested.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.275
How about a lifelong supply of weed?

11:20.360 --> 11:22.191
No!

11:27.680 --> 11:29.750
You know, there is something
you can do for me.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.639
It's something I've always dreamt of.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.114
Just under five ton.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.998
I've never had
such a skimpy prison account.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.389
I'm sorry, Mimo.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.277
Sorry about everything.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.994
I could understand you sacrificing
yourself for Jimmy, but for me too?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.878
- I know.
- I'm glad you know, sweetheart.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.511
I'm pleased you still have...
expectations of me.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.592
I know that you went off
with some scabby smack whore.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.672
And that you betrayed me
and our marriage.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.631
Dump her, ditch the junk
and seal the deal with Harry Stout

12:10.720 --> 12:12.631
or else it's goodnight, Vienna, for us.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.639
Mimi Maguire?

12:15.720 --> 12:19.349
Mimi Maguire, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of assault.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.351
You do not have to say anything

12:21.440 --> 12:22.873
but it may harm your defence

12:22.960 --> 12:25.269
if you do not mention,
when questioned,

12:25.360 --> 12:27.954
something which
you later rely on in court.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.989
Look after your dad for me, son.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.635
I can't let her, Dad.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.756
It's the best way.
We divvy the shite.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.070
It's how this family works!

12:55.160 --> 12:56.957
Remember?

13:06.160 --> 13:08.310
SHOUTING AND LAUGHING

13:08.400 --> 13:09.719
No, you don't!

13:14.920 --> 13:16.239
Bastards!

13:23.280 --> 13:27.114
Debbie, Mr Watsford needs L15
off everyone for the theatre trip.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.430
Well, tell him you'll have it by Monday.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.750
BABY CRYING

13:33.800 --> 13:35.711
Will toast do you?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.916
Stefan's mum doesn't let him
eat refined carbs,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.638
even if they're organic.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.517
Are you complaining?

13:45.600 --> 13:48.160
Stefan says it sounds top round here.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.876
STEAD Y BLEEPING

13:59.040 --> 14:01.270
Funny seeing you laid out.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.956
Reminds me of the time you slipped
down the steps at the Arena.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.998
Made out you were dead.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.718
I put my hand over your face
to see, could I feel the breath.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.030
SIGHS
Dead worried.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.995
CHUCKLES
And then you licked me finger.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.196
I jumped out me skin.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.309
Dickhead!

14:33.600 --> 14:36.239
You had some balls
to mess with my family.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.151
I'll give you that.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.313
So he's blackmailing you?
I don't get your problem.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.358
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't still fancy him.

14:51.840 --> 14:55.515
Well, what if I do? It don't mean
I should put out for the closeted twat.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.316
I'm from the land of the free.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.068
Well, at least I'm not a sadist twat.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.709
I've been looking it up on the internet.
HE INHALES

15:07.800 --> 15:09.631
There's this one page, right,

15:09.720 --> 15:13.030
he said before the fella busted him,

15:13.120 --> 15:16.112
he used a pronged baton on him.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.031
Christ, Micky.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.749
Why don't they just book you in
for a full rectal prolapse?

15:23.800 --> 15:26.473
- You cannot let this happen.
- Well, what can I do?

15:26.560 --> 15:29.552
If I don't go through with it,
he's gonna blow the whistle on our J.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.598
And while he's at it, he might tell
my lot why he changed his mind.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.750
Or tell 'em about me and him.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.475
Right. So he has his ultimate fantasy.

15:41.560 --> 15:45.235
Only we stop it before it gets to the...

15:45.320 --> 15:46.912
(baton stage.)

15:47.000 --> 15:49.878
Are you offering to help me out?

15:52.760 --> 15:56.639
A word of advice - get shot
before you're in too deep, love.

15:56.720 --> 16:01.191
It took four broken ribs, no front teeth
and a punctured lung before I saw sense.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.430
Word of advice.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.556
Lay off the salty snacks, fatty.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.834
Ohh!

16:07.920 --> 16:09.194
Come on, Katie.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.869
She was only being helpful.
No need to rip the woman's head off.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.315
Everyone's such a fucking expert,
aren't they?

16:17.400 --> 16:19.755
At least he wasn't nicking from me purse
or shagging behind me back

16:19.840 --> 16:21.432
- like most blokes round here.
- Fuck me!

16:21.520 --> 16:23.431
When did you decide
to settle for so little?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.919
Piss off!

16:25.000 --> 16:28.276
Knights on white chargers
don't take on soapy losers with kids.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.839
- Mandy!
- You've no idea.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.070
I've got to make the best
of whatever comes my way.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.197
Whatever comes your way? You
wouldn't have entertained a tight bastard,

16:35.280 --> 16:36.872
a smelly one or even a baldy.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.394
So don't make out that
poor little Mandy had no options.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.469
All right.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.677
You've got a brother that'll look out
for ya, a dad that'll see you right

16:43.760 --> 16:47.230
and a roof over your head, despite never
doing a fucking day's work in your life!

16:47.320 --> 16:50.312
Come on, darling. Auntie Kaz's
little friend must be due.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.636
Mandy! I'm sorry!

16:55.760 --> 16:57.352
How is he?

17:25.240 --> 17:26.719
How is it?

17:26.800 --> 17:30.588
Well, apart from the depressed wails
of the women of a night...

17:30.680 --> 17:32.557
MUSIC: Holding Out For A Hero
by Bonnie Tyler

17:32.640 --> 17:35.598
(All) # I need a hero! #

17:35.680 --> 17:38.194
<i>...and the unrelenting physical hardship,</i>

17:38.280 --> 17:41.238
<i>and the dearth of creative stimulus...</i>

17:44.320 --> 17:47.153
...I'd say conditions
have generally improved.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.472
I'm so sorry, Mum.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.438
Couldn't have come at a worse time.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.592
Business hasn't been going great.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.194
- And if the Dudnics get wind...
- The Dudnics?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.236
I've never heard of them.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.996
Three months ago, they were selling
out-of-date tinned meat in pubs.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.958
Now they're into security protection.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.112
<i>They'll be drug trafficking
before the year's out.</i>

18:14.200 --> 18:16.077
There's no way they'd step on Dad's turf.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.470
I appreciate the alarm incident
was regrettable, but...

18:19.560 --> 18:20.993
"Regrettable"?!

18:21.080 --> 18:25.312
Thieves leisurely walk in and lift
40 grand's worth of material.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.119
In all the years I've looked after
these sites, how many have gone up?

18:28.200 --> 18:30.873
Son, they're Romanian.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.758
What respect will they have
for the old manor system?

18:33.840 --> 18:38.516
Ah, Mr Dudnic. I'm happy to say
the papers are ready for signing.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.909
You've given the work
to the Dudnics?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.116
- I think we're done here.
- Harry!

18:43.200 --> 18:45.350
I'm Councillor Stout to you.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.560
Jamie, I'm destroyed to have to ask you.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.916
No, Mam. Please.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.958
Normally I wouldn't, but with your dad
being in the state that he's in...

18:59.040 --> 19:01.349
<i>What is wrong with him?</i>

19:03.400 --> 19:05.356
Dunno. Think he picked
something up in Spain.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.919
What?!

19:07.000 --> 19:10.788
Come on, Mam. There's something
you're not letting on.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.791
I'm telling you everything.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.997
Your dad's not right.
The business is up shit creek.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.470
And with Pinky and Perky
as much use as fingerless fiddlers...

19:20.560 --> 19:22.516
Oh, please, Sal.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.431
Oh, tell me you've got it.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.192
How much is it this time?

19:26.280 --> 19:29.158
- Don't you know?
- I paid 60 last month.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.719
Mam, you're panicking.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.997
Shane and Micky will manage.
They're grown men.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.957
They've been raised with the business.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.395
Original loan 600, over 12 months.

19:38.480 --> 19:40.277
60 times 12, that's...

19:42.200 --> 19:47.228
...720, which makes
Paddy's take... 120 quid.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.231
That's right, isn't it, Sputnik?

19:49.320 --> 19:52.392
...and so was me purse,
and our Keane's Game Boy!

19:52.480 --> 19:55.517
Well, make sure you have it
for next week, eh? Eh?

19:55.600 --> 19:56.953
Come on, get it all out.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.519
Let's round it to 35 big ones, shall we?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.955
You fucking owe me 35 quid!

20:01.040 --> 20:02.996
That's extortion, that is.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.959
You'll be the death of me,
you lads. You will.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.638
<i>You need to trust them.</i>

20:09.720 --> 20:12.917
And break the habit of calling out
my name whenever there's a crisis.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.353
You put me in this crisis!

20:15.520 --> 20:17.431
Don't!

20:17.520 --> 20:19.431
I never asked you to step up for me.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.438
When I was inside, I promised myself

20:26.520 --> 20:28.795
I would never have anything
to do with the business again.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.189
There are few rewards
for breaking some junkie's legs

20:31.280 --> 20:34.477
because the desperate bastard's
trying to short-change me.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.710
Very noble, son.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.552
Making promises, to yourself.

20:38.640 --> 20:43.031
Some years ago, I vowed I'd never
take another communal shower.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.678
But shit happens!

20:53.040 --> 20:56.476
That is all we've got till Friday.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.030
I'd gladly swap, go out and earn
a dollar while you mind Stella,

21:00.120 --> 21:02.236
but you'd probably end up killing her.

21:05.400 --> 21:09.916
âª Oh, what an atmosphere
I love a party with a happy... âª

21:10.000 --> 21:10.989
Shut up!

21:12.800 --> 21:13.949
What's up, Shags?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.190
A bunch of little bastards
keep nicking my milk.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.477
Day three and I'm down 20 quid.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.120
And I ain't had one sniff
of housewife fanny.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.998
Can't you get hold of these kids,
give 'em a good hiding?

21:25.080 --> 21:26.911
They're on skateboards.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.192
There's this laxative, right,
we give out to people at work

21:33.280 --> 21:34.759
who are having bowel scans.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.434
Proper nasty, it is.
We could always spike a few bottles.

21:37.520 --> 21:41.354
Within seconds, they'll think
the Black Sea's gushing out their holes.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.080
Right, better go sort Debs out.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.996
You all right?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.435
I'm sick of living like this, Max.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.080
I'm not after holidays or fancy threads.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.470
Just being able to put some credit
on my mobile would make my day.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.517
You need a night out, mate.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.160
- Yeah, on what?
- I'll sub you.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.389
Your dad manages
to get pissed every night on nowt.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.471
Yeah, but he is a shameless scrounger.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.994
Listen, dip a bit out the budget.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.755
If you can't party on a fiver when you're
young and gorgeous, when can you?

22:24.840 --> 22:27.229
- A fiver?!
- Trust me.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.953
You're outrageous.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.349
Patrick Maguire will not be parked.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.914
Usurped? By two rabid Romany peasants?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.558
No fucking way!

22:44.640 --> 22:47.552
- Where you going?
- To think, Micky!

22:49.160 --> 22:50.593
To plan.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.709
And if you bollockses had anything
about youse, you'd be doing the same.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.353
- What?
- Well, it weren't my fault.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.477
- Fuck!
- Jesus! Jesus!

23:04.560 --> 23:06.232
Get off!

23:06.320 --> 23:07.833
Get off me!

23:09.920 --> 23:11.831
TAP RUNNING

23:11.920 --> 23:13.990
Have you cooled down yet? Have ya?

23:17.360 --> 23:19.510
What's whose fault?

23:19.600 --> 23:21.397
Micky?

23:21.480 --> 23:24.517
The shop owners on Devonshire Parade
have dumped us.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.353
- They're using the Dudnics now.
- Did they give a reason?

23:28.920 --> 23:31.388
All right. They had
a mass break-in last Sunday.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.391
And we never got any of that stock back.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.152
I said to you, "Let's go and look for it."

23:35.240 --> 23:38.949
And he said, "I can't, because I promised
Kelly that I'd do some painting tonight."

23:39.040 --> 23:40.712
For fuck's sake, Shane!

23:40.800 --> 23:43.268
When did glossing Kelly's skirts
come before the day job?

23:45.560 --> 23:47.391
Mam's right.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.234
You two... are fucking useless.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.397

cross the threshold?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.952
CHEERING

24:05.040 --> 24:07.600
- Teen night out, is it?
- Something like that.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.511
'Ere, what say a fiver for a tit flash?

<i>Mimi's busy. Leave a message.</i>

24:27.440 --> 24:29.351
So you're not taking my calls, huh?

24:30.440 --> 24:32.271
Or maybe you've just hit the hay.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.158
First couple of days inside
are always tiring.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.832
Let me guess.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.878
Gym, dinner, Catholic chapel, lights out.

24:42.360 --> 24:46.990
Well... Harry Stout's
a fawning fart, that's all.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.469
He's got new friends now.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.357
The Dudnic brothers.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.873
Still, every cloud.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.392
It's given me the jolt
to exorcise this vile demon.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.519
Tonight...

25:02.080 --> 25:04.116
...will be my last time.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.430
<i>I'm going cold turkey.</i>

25:08.360 --> 25:11.591
What chance has a poppy
against the old Maguire grit, huh?

25:22.280 --> 25:24.874
Come on, Dad.
Get some protein down ya.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.872
Mum won't want to come home
to some scrawny puke.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.951
<i>You think she'll want to come home?</i>

25:32.360 --> 25:35.670
Dad, I'm off visiting. Would you mind
looking after Katie for a few hours?

25:37.080 --> 25:40.789
Mandy, take the child with you.
Your mam'll want to see youse both.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.035
It's not Mam she's going to see.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.951
It's him.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.600
No time to see the woman
that's doing time cos of her.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.636
Doing time cos of me?

25:51.720 --> 25:52.948
Doing time cos of you.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.917
She's running grapes
to the gutless cunt that beats her.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.389
Please, Mandy. Tell me this isn't right.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.556
You're a fine one
to put me in a guilt trip.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.312
Have you been to see Mum?

26:02.400 --> 26:04.311
No.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.755
So you can stop firing
the disappointed looks.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.039
Katie.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.956
I was thrilled
when all my babies were born.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.838
But when my wee girl
was placed into my arms

26:24.920 --> 26:29.994
and stared up at me with the most
innocent, trusting eyes that I'd ever saw,

26:30.080 --> 26:33.595
well, love hit me like a bullet.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.236
I knew I'd always love her.
And respect her.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.676
Are you gonna look after her or what?

26:41.760 --> 26:43.955
Kills me to know you can't do
the same for yourself.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.350
Course we'll mind her.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.397
I've a few errands to run.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.198
I'll find you a babysitter.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.672
Sure you don't mind giving us a lift?

28:07.760 --> 28:09.273
It's all right.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.989
<i>I'll get my bum cheeks waxed after
I've dropped you off at the hospital.</i>

28:14.960 --> 28:16.951
Looks like you're well settled here.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.792
Suppose I am.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.553
I told his Auntie Peg I'd stay until
she found a proper carer for him.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.029
Doesn't seem to be
in much of a hurry, though.

28:24.120 --> 28:28.113
Ain't it odd living with a strange
teenager you can't talk to?

28:28.200 --> 28:31.033
See, that could describe our Carl.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.519
BOTH LAUGHING

28:32.600 --> 28:35.672
It's great.
I can do what, and who, I like.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.354
I don't have to hide
nothing from no-one.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.192
Oh, um... how are things with your dad?

28:46.040 --> 28:49.396
They made me feel about
as rubbish as you can feel.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.398
I walked away and slapped myself,
hoping it was a dream.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.636
Fat fucking chance.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.118
I'll get the car keys.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.795
In all the time we've been together...

29:09.520 --> 29:11.875
...he's never once
told me he loves me.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.756
Look at you nodding away at me.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.157
Not a bloody clue
what I'm going on about, have you?

29:32.920 --> 29:34.319
They know they've hurt us.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.278
Next they'll smell the fear,
then we'll pounce.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.397
I'd call Harry Stout,
offer him a backhander.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.277
Only the bank called first thing.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.920
The account's overdrawn.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.639
Check what the lads took yesterday.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.757
<i>Please, Jamie, you've gotta help me.</i>

29:50.840 --> 29:53.308
VIDEO GAME BLEEPING

29:54.400 --> 29:56.152
What'd you take yesterday?

30:04.200 --> 30:06.156
It should be ten times that.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.879
But with it being near the end of
the month... people are blasted.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.313
Business is on the brink

30:10.400 --> 30:13.437
and youse two are lounging around
like Jeeves and fucking Wooster!

30:13.520 --> 30:16.193
Piss off and do some work!

30:16.280 --> 30:18.748
Meet me outside
the community centre at four.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.197
Fuck!

30:29.200 --> 30:30.872
Crap being the eldest, innit?

30:30.960 --> 30:32.359
Mmm.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.354
Are things really that bad?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.476
Well, they're not good.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.471
So what will you do?

30:45.120 --> 30:47.634
Gotta teach those fuckers how it's done.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.672
MAN GRUNTING

31:09.600 --> 31:11.397
Payback time, Micky.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.438
His cock throbbed wildly

31:18.520 --> 31:21.671
as he watched
the sergeant's warm, wet mouth

31:21.760 --> 31:25.150
engulf his long, taut tool.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.593
Keep going, keep going.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.318
- Erm...
- Keep going.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.231
Keep going, you little Manc bitch.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.630
A strong finger
pumped the palladium hard.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.438
Perineum, you cretin!

31:35.520 --> 31:37.112
Keep going.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.031
HE GROANS
...pumped the palla... perin...

31:39.120 --> 31:40.792
whatever. Erm...

31:40.880 --> 31:43.997
As the boy began to jerk him
up and down,

31:44.080 --> 31:46.913
- down and up, twisting...
- Ohh...

31:48.760 --> 31:50.910
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.275
Erm... softer and harder.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.476
Twisting... Oh, come on!

31:55.560 --> 31:56.993
Hang on, man, I'm not there yet.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.479
I said keep it going.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.235
- Rhythm. Rhythm, sunshine. That's it!
- Twisting!

32:02.320 --> 32:04.197
Then second left by the chippie.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.679
OK. Grazie.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.512
Prego.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.759
Oh, shit!

32:12.480 --> 32:16.029
The detective raced inside him.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.519
What next?

32:18.600 --> 32:21.956
Twisting. Twisting.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.678
Freeze!

32:23.760 --> 32:25.318
Fuck me.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.960
Not that you'd want to.

32:29.040 --> 32:32.589
Why, Sergeant Moran... Ugh!

32:35.760 --> 32:37.398
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.313
Please, can this stay between us?

32:40.400 --> 32:42.152
I'm up for inspector next month.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.470
I can get you off Station Watch.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.312
Find you something in Mounted.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.914
Bribery might be a part
of your policing, sarge,

32:49.000 --> 32:50.797
but I'm not going there.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.518
It insults my intelligence.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.279
And where the fuck was you?!

33:09.360 --> 33:12.352
"Twisting" was the cue!
It couldn't be any fucking simpler!

33:15.520 --> 33:17.078
In fact, it was your idea.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.549
I know. I'm sorry. I got tied up.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.631
On duty.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.790
Ohh... Did he get his pronged baton out?

33:27.880 --> 33:30.394
No! Now, fuck off!

33:30.480 --> 33:32.948
Oh, don't be like this.
Look at the positives.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.600
You're not wounded, you've kept
your brother out the nick

33:35.680 --> 33:37.910
and you've got some
hand-job practice in!

33:42.720 --> 33:44.597
Anything else while I'm on me toes?

33:47.680 --> 33:49.432
DISTANT SIREN WAILING

33:58.800 --> 34:02.509
It's a loss. Finding yourself a lone dad.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.754
Paddy, I've been here.
I know what you're going through.

34:06.840 --> 34:11.469
To just switch from hunter-gatherer
to primary carer

34:11.560 --> 34:14.154
is demasculising.

34:14.239 --> 34:18.710
You've got to wrestle this black dog,
send it down the road, packing.

34:18.800 --> 34:22.793
Well, Francis, thank you
for coming to my emotional rescue.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.791
MOUTHING WORDS

34:24.880 --> 34:28.315
Now, would you kindly
open the window, piss off,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.231
and leave a sick man in peace?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.036
Oh, Katie!

34:48.719 --> 34:51.313
Oh, fucking hell!

34:51.400 --> 34:53.550
Argh! Ugh!

34:58.280 --> 35:00.510
(Paddy) Gallagher!

35:00.600 --> 35:02.272
Gallagher!

Got a delivery for Shane Maguire, right?

35:15.160 --> 35:17.720
Tell him it's pure, so if he
don't want to kill his punters

35:17.800 --> 35:20.360
he needs to get his talc
and his milk powder out.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.992
Jesus!

35:29.080 --> 35:30.798
Frank! Frank!

35:30.880 --> 35:33.474
I've an awful sore throat on me,
so I have.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.074
I need you to pop out
and fetch me home some lozenges.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.354
Right!

35:40.440 --> 35:42.032
OK.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.395
This is how the Dudnics do it.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.040
This is how you'll do it from now on.

35:48.240 --> 35:52.438
Mate, can I get an ambulance, please,
to number 10 Cavendish Walk?

35:52.520 --> 35:55.398
There's a lady here, slit throat,

35:55.480 --> 35:56.708
pissing blood.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.472
Thanks.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.751
Paddy Maguire wants his 100 notes.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.831
I'll just go and get it.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.557
See?

36:17.760 --> 36:19.671
Hey! What's going on?
What's happening?

36:19.760 --> 36:22.433
Oh... no... Stop it.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.795
Sputnik's racing on Friday.

36:24.880 --> 36:29.749
20% APR, my arse.
Paddy Maguire is not fucking Visa.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.474
I want the outstanding 80, now.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.152
OK. OK.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.629
I'll... have to nip down
to the cashpoint, mind.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.790
That's all right.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.996
Since you're such a valued customer...

36:43.080 --> 36:44.877
...we'll drive you there.

Where's the smelly tosser put it?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.512
Yeah! Shh, shh, shh, shh!

37:21.200 --> 37:23.589
It's not so much him I'm crying for.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.796
It's me poor mum.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.518
It is.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.756
Remember, I'm always here, yeah?

37:34.120 --> 37:35.519
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:50.400 --> 37:51.833
Cheers, Danny.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.189
MAN LAUGHS
Any change?

38:07.280 --> 38:08.713
Mandy!

38:08.800 --> 38:11.439
I'm sorry for being a cow.

38:16.320 --> 38:20.029
I suppose I'm just mad at you...
for caring about him.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.032
I understand.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.475
If anyone was hurting
my lovely best mate,

38:27.560 --> 38:28.993
I'd rip their face off.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.837
Come here, you soft bitch.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.038
Why do you keep going to see him?

38:43.160 --> 38:44.559
Dunno.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.999
Once I know he's going to be
all right... or not...

38:50.080 --> 38:53.072
then I can start making decisions, but...

38:53.160 --> 38:55.151
till then, I'm stuck.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.478
So once you know...

38:59.560 --> 39:01.073
...you'll stop seeing him?

39:01.160 --> 39:04.038
I'd be an idiot to do anything else.

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.074
Go in there, now, Katie.

39:51.160 --> 39:55.711
The agreement was, while I took Katie,
you kept an eye on Stella.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.109
Remember, terror
is more effective than brutality.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.719
It's all about surprise, yeah?

40:07.400 --> 40:09.675
You can collect from
Devonshire Parade on your own.

40:09.760 --> 40:12.399
- Paddy? Paddy, got 'em.
- Fuck!

40:12.480 --> 40:14.675
Paddy, where are ya?

40:17.560 --> 40:20.199
Oh, fuck! No!

40:20.280 --> 40:24.592
Christ, Gallagher. A man's ablutions
are secret. You knock before entering.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.079
It's gonna kill you, Paddy.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.639
Oh, and alcoholism won't?

40:27.720 --> 40:29.790
I'm not trying to be holier-than-thou,
just listen!

40:29.880 --> 40:32.474
Fuck, no! Fuck...

40:34.560 --> 40:36.232
No, I can't let ya!

40:37.240 --> 40:40.835
Come on, I can't let ya! I can't let ya!

40:40.920 --> 40:43.514
- What the fuck you doing?
- Give me a lift, will ya?

40:43.600 --> 40:46.672
I'm trying to save him from himself.
The drop-off man says it's pure.

It's mine! It's mine!

41:04.280 --> 41:05.998
How could you, Dad?

41:06.080 --> 41:08.958
At least we know
what's up with him now.

41:09.040 --> 41:13.272
(Jamie) A dealer never touches his own
stock. Isn't that what you've always said?

41:13.360 --> 41:17.751
- Dad!
- You think after all these years clean

41:17.840 --> 41:19.990
I woke up one morning and thought,

41:20.080 --> 41:23.277
"Why don't I stick a needle
in my vein and taste my own wares?"

41:23.360 --> 41:24.918
This was done to me!

41:26.160 --> 41:27.149
By who?

41:28.200 --> 41:29.519
<i>Fuck off!</i>

41:29.600 --> 41:32.717
Fuck off, the lot of youse!
None of your fucking business!

41:32.800 --> 41:35.234
Fuck the lot of youse!

41:35.320 --> 41:38.118
How dare you question me?

41:38.200 --> 41:40.794
Stop your fucking gawping!

41:40.880 --> 41:44.509
You fucking...

41:51.680 --> 41:52.590
Get away!

42:03.720 --> 42:06.075
I'm telling you - 20 seconds max.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.116
You'd never know they'd been touched.

42:08.200 --> 42:09.235
Mm-hm.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.198
WPC Donnelly,
you are a bloody legend!

42:12.280 --> 42:15.670
Oi! We're all constables now.
You sexist prick.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.514
Debbie, Mr Watsford says he needs
that 15 quid before the weekend.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.319
- Right. Come on, I'm having a go.
- Are you?

42:22.400 --> 42:25.312
- Good luck.
- Good luck?

42:25.400 --> 42:27.868
- Don't need luck.
- You need a steady hand.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.678
Where'd you get that from?

42:33.840 --> 42:36.274
What about credit for your mobile?

42:39.480 --> 42:41.277
<i>(Mandy) So who's gonna run things?</i>

42:43.000 --> 42:44.353
Dad can't.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.399
I suppose it's left to my lad over here
to step up and show his mettle.

42:48.480 --> 42:51.358
He's creative, handy, flexible.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.715
With respect, Kelly...

42:53.800 --> 42:55.711
Dad doesn't do interior design.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.431
I'm taking over.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.476
(Kelly) Eldest son succeeds.
Fucking typical!

43:03.560 --> 43:06.074
Do you have a problem with that, Shane?

43:06.160 --> 43:10.199
To be honest, babe, I just want to be free
to invest me energies in other stuff.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.397
Trafficking body parts.
That's where the serious money is.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.118
See?

43:15.200 --> 43:16.918
Visionary.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.752
You said nothing could draw you back.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.115
Don't make me explain myself, Mand.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.750
Your livelihood comes from this business.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.991
Would you rather I stuck to me word
and you and Katie go without?

43:29.080 --> 43:30.991
- (Katie) Mummy!
- I'm coming.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.911
(Micky) What about the Dudnics?

43:33.640 --> 43:35.631
<i>No need to worry about them any more.</i>

43:47.040 --> 43:50.271
Well, I want you two round this table
tomorrow morning, eight o'clock.

43:51.360 --> 43:56.115
We'll be talking business models
and enforcement. OK?

43:57.240 --> 43:59.595
- OK?
- Uh-huh.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.678
<i>(Jamie) There's a Spanish proverb</i>

44:11.760 --> 44:14.593
<i>says an ounce of blood is worth
more than a pound of friendship.</i>

44:14.680 --> 44:17.990
<i>Being part of a family
isn't always easy.</i>

44:18.080 --> 44:20.071
<i>It can be unpleasant.</i>

44:21.240 --> 44:24.835
<i>There's rivalry, resentment,
feeling stifled.</i>

44:29.560 --> 44:32.791
<i>They can disappoint you, disgust you.</i>

44:32.880 --> 44:34.757
<i>But you never give up on them.</i>

44:35.880 --> 44:40.271
<i>You'll sacrifice your own wants
and needs because, like it or not,</i>

44:40.360 --> 44:42.874
<i>you're tied to the tossers for life.</i>

44:46.400 --> 44:48.834
<i>Friends and lovers may come and go</i>

44:48.920 --> 44:51.514
<i>but the clan remains.</i>

45:37.960 --> 45:39.712
What dainty dishes

45:39.800 --> 45:45.636
will the weary manny feast from before
quenching the most arid of thirsts?

45:46.560 --> 45:48.471
Sod all, that's what.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.639
HE FARTS

46:00.120 --> 46:02.236
HE GROANS

46:02.320 --> 46:04.470
- All right, Frank?
- Yes, mate.

46:04.560 --> 46:06.471
FARTING AND GROANING

46:07.305 --> 46:13.827
