WEBVTT

01:06.801 --> 01:11.539
The practice of Cursive Writing
in the handwriting system

01:11.573 --> 01:13.675
known as the Palmer Method

01:13.708 --> 01:15.543
will be one of the most
important things

01:15.577 --> 01:17.745
you will ever learn.

01:17.779 --> 01:21.516
In basic loop practice,
we embody a balance

01:21.549 --> 01:26.353
between control and relaxation.

01:26.386 --> 01:30.390
Success in the execution
of Palmer loops

01:30.424 --> 01:35.697
demands that you locate
the beat of your inner drummer.

01:35.730 --> 01:40.233
The heartbeat that guides
your handwriting.

01:49.443 --> 01:53.246
Silence!

01:56.383 --> 01:59.621
It's this class called
Art Without Boundaries.

01:59.654 --> 02:01.923
It's where people that
are differently-abled

02:01.956 --> 02:04.291
create together.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.193
Mm-hmm.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.495
I want to photograph folks
with verbal challenges

02:08.529 --> 02:11.398
as they make art.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.936
As Valedictorian, you know,
you got a real opportunity here.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.404
You know, your thesis is going
to be heavily scrutinized.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.374
I'm just not sure taking
pictures is really enough.

02:20.407 --> 02:23.477
And for the literary connection
to your class

02:23.511 --> 02:27.180
well, maybe we can use
Ginsberg's American Sentences?

02:27.214 --> 02:29.483
From class?

02:29.517 --> 02:34.388
And I was hoping
you'd be my advisor.

02:34.421 --> 02:38.458
Ahh.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.294
My grandmother had Alzheimer's.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.331
We used to be really close
before she got sick.

02:44.364 --> 02:48.603
Towards the end,
she didn't know any of us.

02:48.636 --> 02:53.373
I'm just sorry I didn't find out
more about her.

02:57.812 --> 03:03.751
"Who tells the stories of people
who have limited or no language?

03:03.785 --> 03:09.724
Is there a way to help such
people tell their own stories?"

03:16.329 --> 03:17.875
Up, down, and around.
Up, down, and around.

03:17.899 --> 03:20.668
Palmer Method Cursive Loop
practice has been shown

03:20.702 --> 03:22.770
to light up little-used

03:22.804 --> 03:26.641
or even failing connections
in the brain.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.010
Up, down, and around.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.311
Up, down, and around.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.514
Up, down, and around.

03:33.548 --> 03:35.583
Up, down, and around.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.752
Up, down, and around.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.854
Up, down, and around.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.290
Up, down, and around.

03:43.323 --> 03:46.326
Bravo.

03:46.359 --> 03:52.499
Please, she often thinks she's
back teaching at our school.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.804
If people can just let her
have that story.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.882
Goodbye, Sister.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.585
Ciao.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.454
Goodbye.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.957
God bless.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.658
We will see you again soon.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.427
SÃ¬, si.

04:37.078 --> 04:40.081
This is your new room, Giorgia.

04:40.114 --> 04:45.318
See? All your things are here.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.687
No.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.756
Look, look, look.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.825
Your pillow is there.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.594
See?

05:35.970 --> 05:38.706
Charles, stop avoiding me.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.577
Call me back.

05:42.610 --> 05:46.379
We need to talk about Cody,
Charles.

05:46.413 --> 05:52.854
Charles, just call me back.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.859
Ta-da.

06:31.893 --> 06:34.028
Do you like my dress?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.596
It's new.

06:35.630 --> 06:38.933
It's from
Frederick and Nelson's.

06:38.966 --> 06:43.170
Your father bought it
especially.

06:43.204 --> 06:45.006
When is Catherine coming?

06:45.039 --> 06:47.875
Soon.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.594
God, would you look at
all those kids.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.462
Pew, pew, pew.

07:09.496 --> 07:13.134
Oh honey,
you forgot your button.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.506
Why don't we have more kids?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.074
Phrase it properly, Charles.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.009
I think what you mean to say is,

07:22.043 --> 07:27.114
Why don't you and Dad
have more children?

07:27.148 --> 07:30.818
Well, why don't you?

07:30.851 --> 07:35.488
Because God knew I could only
be a good mother to one child.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.225
Like Mary.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.069
Mr. and Mrs. Marlow,

07:48.102 --> 07:50.638
I know this may not be
what you want to hear,

07:50.671 --> 07:53.507
but I'm hoping
you're open to the idea.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.277
I believe we should try
medication.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.213
Selective Serotonin
Reuptake Inhibitors

07:59.246 --> 08:01.615
have proven efficacious

08:01.649 --> 08:05.186
for some children with Cody's...

08:05.219 --> 08:06.988
behaviors.

08:07.021 --> 08:09.156
Now, you would have to
take extensive notes

08:09.190 --> 08:11.826
on how Cody's mood might shift.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.295
But we can start
as early as this week.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.598
Aspergillus, Cladosporium,

08:17.631 --> 08:23.037
Stachybotrys, Penicillin,
are most likely.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.606
Hopefully we're just dealing
with standard

08:25.639 --> 08:27.241
run of the mill black mold.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.143
In which case,
the protocols are clear,

08:29.176 --> 08:31.746
and have proven to be
very effective.

08:31.779 --> 08:35.683
I don't know why we didn't think
about this before.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.118
Black mold.

08:37.151 --> 08:40.654
Yes, in the crawlspace.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.758
I mean, we're probably all sick

08:43.791 --> 08:46.027
and don't even know about it,
right?

08:46.060 --> 08:48.729
That's quite possible,
I'm sorry to say.

08:48.763 --> 08:50.698
And of course,
a child's immune system...

08:50.731 --> 08:53.134
Is so much more vulnerable.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.669
Precisely.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.672
Is he toilet-trained?

09:04.311 --> 09:07.014
He can write his own name.

09:07.048 --> 09:11.652
Well, some recent studies
have linked immune responses

09:11.685 --> 09:15.189
to Sick Building Syndrome.

09:15.222 --> 09:21.762
And to the Autism Spectrum,
actually.

09:21.796 --> 09:24.632
Umm...

09:26.801 --> 09:31.205
No... No one has mentioned
Autism before.

09:31.238 --> 09:35.643
We'll do whatever it takes
to make it better.

09:35.676 --> 09:41.282
Is he tantrumming
more than usual?

09:41.315 --> 09:45.152
You could say that.

09:45.186 --> 09:48.355
And he has lost his words?

09:51.392 --> 09:54.095
Alison.

09:56.063 --> 10:01.402
I believe we are dealing
with Sick Building Syndrome.

10:01.435 --> 10:05.339
As caused by
biological contaminants.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.241
We can't move.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.743
I mean, that's the only home
that Cody has ever known.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.379
And he loves the trees,
he loves...

10:12.413 --> 10:16.617
That is of course your decision.

10:55.122 --> 11:00.060
We are going to bind
our arms to our rulers.

11:00.094 --> 11:06.200
The cloths are to be wrapped
and tied in three locations.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.936
First, around the palm
of the hand,

11:08.969 --> 11:11.438
between the thumb
and forefinger.

11:11.472 --> 11:14.875
Then, around the wrist.

11:14.909 --> 11:18.112
And finally, around the forearm
just below the elbow.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.880
Any questions?

11:19.914 --> 11:22.082
Okay, let's get this done.

11:22.116 --> 11:25.252
Mm, ugh.

11:34.529 --> 11:38.432
Please keep your talking
to a minimum.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.135
Please sit up straight.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.971
Position yourself properly.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.507
Take up your pencils, and begin

11:45.540 --> 11:51.745
your one-minute timed
loop practice, now.

11:56.518 --> 11:59.119
Come on, Dana, you can do this.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.889
Take your pencil.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.925
Come on.

12:17.338 --> 12:18.405
Five.

12:18.439 --> 12:19.473
Four.

12:19.507 --> 12:20.841
Three.

12:20.874 --> 12:21.909
Two.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.345
One.

12:24.378 --> 12:26.380
Dana McGucken, that's enough!

12:26.413 --> 12:29.950
Calm down!

12:29.984 --> 12:32.953
Take it off him.

12:38.526 --> 12:40.528
I'm sorry, Dana.

12:40.562 --> 12:43.264
I'm very sorry.

12:43.297 --> 12:45.199
It's all right,

12:45.232 --> 12:48.902
it's all right.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.405
You won't have to do that again.

13:01.282 --> 13:04.485
Mrs. Braxton,
your nose is bleeding.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.497
Let us continue.

13:16.531 --> 13:23.070
Please begin your one-minute
bed spring oval practice, now.

13:44.058 --> 13:47.394
Good morning, Cody.

13:51.432 --> 13:55.235
Oh boy, a new day.

13:55.269 --> 14:00.374
A new chance for Cody
to earn lots of stickers.

14:00.407 --> 14:04.311
Okay now, Cody, time to get up.

14:04.345 --> 14:06.980
Where's Cody?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.315
Where's Cody?

14:08.349 --> 14:10.050
Where did he go?

14:10.084 --> 14:13.387
Ah! There he is!

14:13.420 --> 14:14.589
Okay, now.

14:14.622 --> 14:17.157
Here are your slippers.

14:17.191 --> 14:21.462
Let's see if you get
your first sticker.

14:25.399 --> 14:27.368
Good job.

14:27.401 --> 14:30.404
Now let's go to the bathroom
and see how you did.

14:30.437 --> 14:34.475
I sure hope you get a sticker.

14:36.243 --> 14:39.246
This way and a little bit.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.949
Let's try.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.152
Let's try again.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.154
One more.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.956
One more.

14:48.989 --> 14:52.993
And then you get a sticker
for breakfast.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.662
Come on, come on.

14:54.696 --> 14:59.366
Here, let me help you.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.270
There you go.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.540
There you go.

15:05.573 --> 15:06.708
That's it.

15:06.741 --> 15:08.375
Good job.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.244
Good job.

15:17.719 --> 15:19.721
Cody?

15:19.754 --> 15:23.357
Your dad is here.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.192
It's your dad.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.663
And look,
he's got a grocery bag.

15:28.696 --> 15:30.297
Hey, Pal.

15:30.330 --> 15:35.235
How you doing?

15:35.269 --> 15:38.939
Brought you something.

15:45.179 --> 15:48.081
Have fun.

15:52.787 --> 15:54.455
Hey!

15:54.488 --> 15:57.191
Hey, Cody, Cody, give that back
to Raisa right now!

15:57.224 --> 15:59.993
Cody!

16:20.582 --> 16:25.653
He sure does love playing
with those noodles.

16:31.492 --> 16:32.760
- Too rough!
- No, it's okay.

16:32.794 --> 16:34.428
My fault.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.197
Your hurt your father!

16:37.231 --> 16:40.635
After he bring
all those noodles for you.

16:40.668 --> 16:43.270
I set timer now.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.138
Ten minutes.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.408
- No more.
- That's right.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.378
You want a sticker, you have
to put those noodles away

16:51.411 --> 16:53.213
the very second
that timer goes off.

16:53.247 --> 16:57.117
No fussing.

17:36.423 --> 17:40.127
Are you okay?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.265
Giorgia?

17:45.299 --> 17:48.435
Shh, Giorgia.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.705
Giorgia?

17:50.738 --> 17:53.407
It's okay,
it's going to be okay.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.842
Giorgia?

17:54.876 --> 17:58.312
Giorgia!

17:58.345 --> 18:01.248
It's going to be okay!

18:03.751 --> 18:06.821
It's going to be okay, Giorgia.

18:06.854 --> 18:08.523
Calm down now.

18:08.556 --> 18:11.693
Calm down now.

18:21.636 --> 18:23.212
Okay, all right,
we're almost done, Honey.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.807
Then we can go
get your sandwich.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.777
The... the entire floor is going
to have to be concreted.

18:29.811 --> 18:30.778
We need Visqueen.

18:30.812 --> 18:33.180
We need additional venting.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.716
- They're...
- Visqueen?

18:34.749 --> 18:36.651
Venting?

18:36.684 --> 18:40.688
Daddy, I know you think
this is a lot, but I...

18:40.722 --> 18:41.889
No, no, no.

18:41.923 --> 18:44.626
Not if you're staying here.

18:44.659 --> 18:47.829
But your mother and I think
you should consider moving,

18:47.862 --> 18:49.396
not renovating.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.465
There are some nice places near
the canal.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.367
We checked.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.268
We're not moving.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.571
Sweetheart?

18:56.604 --> 19:01.843
Why beat a dead horse?

19:01.876 --> 19:05.178
So, when does she plan on
making the big ask?

19:05.212 --> 19:07.649
After dessert?

19:07.682 --> 19:09.584
Oh, the...

19:09.617 --> 19:11.886
God, don't play innocent
with me, Charles.

19:11.919 --> 19:15.823
I'll be surprised if she hasn't
catered the entire meal.

19:15.857 --> 19:20.193
Hired a Master of Ceremonies.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.639
Wish someone would tell her
she doesn't have to treat us

19:21.663 --> 19:27.802
like we're potential
corporate sponsors.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.738
I haven't been entirely
truthful.

19:30.772 --> 19:33.574
It is a fact that
I've never seen one of Cody's

19:33.608 --> 19:37.244
full-blown fits,
but I've sensed something.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.646
Nothing I could put a finger on.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.349
Just a feeling that things
weren't quite right.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.452
I love my daughter dearly.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.724
But she has a tendency
to let hope outlast the truth.

19:53.027 --> 19:55.495
I believe in modern day
psychological terms

19:55.530 --> 19:59.801
this would be known as denial.

20:06.674 --> 20:09.376
He's lost all his words.

20:13.614 --> 20:17.384
What do you think
is wrong with him?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.020
There his is.

20:19.053 --> 20:21.421
There's my snuggle bunny.

20:21.455 --> 20:22.757
Sweetheart!

20:22.790 --> 20:25.526
Hello, darling.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.796
Eskimo kiss.

20:28.830 --> 20:33.333
Horse kiss.

20:33.366 --> 20:38.973
Butterfly kiss.

20:39.006 --> 20:40.775
What I believe,
Charles, doesn't matter.

20:40.808 --> 20:42.577
Not in the long run.

20:42.610 --> 20:47.314
It's what you and Alison
believe that's important.

20:50.685 --> 20:52.352
Hi, you've reached Charles.

20:52.385 --> 20:56.490
Leave a message.

20:56.524 --> 20:57.925
Charles, I know you're there.

20:57.959 --> 21:00.561
It's a school night.

21:00.595 --> 21:03.296
Pick up.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.566
Pick up, Charles.

21:15.109 --> 21:17.545
Bartending exam. One.

21:17.578 --> 21:20.347
Name ingredients
in a Moscow Mule.

21:42.904 --> 21:44.939
Correct. Two.

21:44.972 --> 21:50.377
What is the proper glass in
which to serve a Bacardi Buck?

22:00.121 --> 22:01.364
How do you make sense
of the fact that

22:01.388 --> 22:06.093
you're working as a bartender?

22:27.515 --> 22:28.749
Designated driver?

22:28.783 --> 22:31.451
Designated Sherpa.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.887
Alison ForchÃ©.

22:32.920 --> 22:37.992
It's nice to meet you, Charles.

22:38.025 --> 22:41.796
With, um, with whom
are you on expedition?

22:41.829 --> 22:44.397
My brother Aiden is the drummer.

22:44.431 --> 22:48.069
Here, have a seat.

22:48.102 --> 22:50.571
We made a deal, I promised
that I would haul his gear

22:50.605 --> 22:52.740
around this weekend, if he
promises to haul my books

22:52.773 --> 22:54.675
across Manhattan in four months.

22:54.709 --> 22:56.443
What happens in four months?

22:56.476 --> 23:00.715
I'm graduating, moving, and then
I am starting my internship.

23:00.748 --> 23:02.617
Oh, wow, well, groovy.

23:02.650 --> 23:06.020
Have you thought about
my question?

23:06.053 --> 23:07.822
- Well...
- I'm sorry that I inundated you

23:07.855 --> 23:09.924
with all of these, it's just
that the groom's mother

23:09.957 --> 23:12.059
wanted me to toss them,
and I couldn't bear to.

23:12.093 --> 23:13.895
They're just so lovely.

23:13.928 --> 23:15.129
Alison! I need you!

23:15.162 --> 23:16.964
I'll be right there.

23:16.998 --> 23:18.065
I gotta go.

23:18.099 --> 23:19.867
Why get rid of them?

23:19.901 --> 23:21.002
The napkins?

23:21.035 --> 23:23.671
Oh, because of the typo.

23:23.704 --> 23:28.776
See? Li... live will
keep us together.

23:28.809 --> 23:32.213
Oh, is it a quote
from something?

23:32.246 --> 23:34.048
Okay.

23:34.081 --> 23:37.184
Not a big fan of popular music.

23:37.218 --> 23:39.452
Not really, no.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.689
Well, it's been fun.

23:41.722 --> 23:42.900
- Yeah.
- A promise is a promise.

23:42.924 --> 23:44.892
I should help my brother.

23:44.926 --> 23:46.036
I would like to see you again.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.195
I'll say goodbye before I leave.

23:48.229 --> 23:50.064
No, I meant like get a coffee...

23:50.097 --> 23:51.165
I know what you meant.

23:51.198 --> 23:53.634
I'm thinking about it.

23:53.668 --> 23:57.104
Plus, I fly to New York
tomorrow.

24:14.121 --> 24:16.257
Okay.

24:16.290 --> 24:23.898
I prefer written correspondence
to telephone conversations.

24:23.931 --> 24:28.636
And though you are under
no legal obligation

24:28.669 --> 24:32.506
to return this,
this is my favorite.

24:32.540 --> 24:35.743
So, use it, re-gift it.

24:35.776 --> 24:41.649
Whatever you do,
please do not throw it away.

24:58.833 --> 25:02.536
Goodbye, Charles.

25:06.574 --> 25:08.776
Before June 10th, I will be
at Columbia University.

25:08.809 --> 25:11.145
School of Law at this address.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.681
After June 10th when I graduate,
my law books and I

25:13.714 --> 25:16.083
will be living on West 10th,
at this address.

25:16.117 --> 25:18.652
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Charles.

25:18.686 --> 25:21.222
You are an excellent bartender.

25:21.255 --> 25:23.991
Nevertheless, I do hope that
you'll give some thought

25:24.025 --> 25:26.127
to that question.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.962
Best wishes, Alison.

25:27.995 --> 25:30.931
P.S. I'll want to have
children right away.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.035
May I help you?

25:34.068 --> 25:35.803
Hello? Hi.

25:35.836 --> 25:40.241
I'm wondering if Alison ForchÃ©
lives here.

25:40.274 --> 25:42.043
One moment.

25:42.076 --> 25:45.146
Hello?

26:25.786 --> 26:29.356
What are you doing?

26:31.826 --> 26:33.928
Marry me.

26:33.961 --> 26:36.931
Come back to Seattle
and marry me.

26:36.964 --> 26:42.269
Today, tomorrow,
in a year, soon.

26:42.303 --> 26:44.839
Yes! Yes!

26:48.976 --> 26:51.245
I have a surprise
for the two of you.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.380
Oh yeah?

26:53.414 --> 26:55.683
Your father and I are taking
Cody for the next four days,

26:55.716 --> 26:59.420
so the two of you
can get away together.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.756
I know his routine and rules.

27:02.790 --> 27:06.327
He can't be touched on the neck,
especially when eating.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.729
No, Mother. No, no, no.

27:08.762 --> 27:11.298
We can't... we can't
possibly get away

27:11.332 --> 27:12.967
with everything with going on.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.078
- I'm sorry, this is not...
- I've reserved three nights

27:15.102 --> 27:17.037
at a B&B in La Conner.

27:17.071 --> 27:18.272
Three?

27:18.305 --> 27:19.807
Three nights?

27:19.840 --> 27:22.443
There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

27:22.476 --> 27:23.978
Go and pack.

27:24.011 --> 27:25.980
If you get on the road
in the next

27:26.013 --> 27:27.414
ninety minutes or so,

27:27.448 --> 27:29.750
you'll arrive in time for
dinner.

27:29.783 --> 27:32.987
I made a reservation
at a phenomenal restaurant.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.755
Mother.

27:34.788 --> 27:37.091
This is insane!

27:37.124 --> 27:39.093
- What's insane about it?
- You!

27:39.126 --> 27:41.162
Wouldn't you like to get away?

27:41.195 --> 27:42.730
Well!

27:42.763 --> 27:44.031
Where's Cody?

27:44.064 --> 27:45.232
He's upstairs.

27:45.266 --> 27:46.934
He's with his therapist.

27:46.967 --> 27:49.036
Fine, I'll stay until
his lesson is over.

27:49.069 --> 27:51.071
And I can pack his things
while I'm waiting.

27:51.105 --> 27:52.840
Thank you, I mean that's...

27:52.873 --> 27:55.709
Your father and I have all sorts
of lovely activities planned.

27:55.743 --> 27:58.479
- We'll have a wonderful time.
- Okay.

27:58.513 --> 28:00.848
I just don't think that
you and Daddy understand

28:00.881 --> 28:03.751
how complicated our life is,
I mean...

28:03.784 --> 28:05.753
I understand perfectly Alison,

28:05.786 --> 28:09.490
and that's exactly why you and
your husband need to get away.

28:59.273 --> 29:00.508
All right, class.

29:00.542 --> 29:04.378
Present arms.

29:04.411 --> 29:08.048
And begin.

29:15.055 --> 29:19.026
Notice the evenness
with which Charles writes.

29:19.059 --> 29:22.129
The steady pressure
he puts on the chalk.

29:22.162 --> 29:26.133
Notice how he keeps
his arms relaxed.

29:26.166 --> 29:30.104
Look at how consistent he is.

29:30.137 --> 29:33.007
Quite exceptional.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.110
Textbook perfect.

29:36.143 --> 29:39.980
- Quite exceptional.
- Perfect.

29:40.014 --> 29:41.815
Bradley! Mitchell!

29:41.849 --> 29:46.987
Shall I send you to detention?

29:51.091 --> 29:53.294
Go!

29:57.965 --> 29:59.400
All right, class.

29:59.433 --> 30:03.571
Let us resume with
a series of lower case A's.

30:03.605 --> 30:07.609
Charles will continue to lead,
and I will call out a rhythm.

30:07.642 --> 30:11.879
Present arms.

30:11.912 --> 30:15.282
And up, down.

30:15.316 --> 30:17.418
Up, down.

30:17.451 --> 30:19.621
Up, down.

30:19.654 --> 30:23.023
Up, down.

30:23.057 --> 30:25.859
Dana, quiet please.

30:33.334 --> 30:39.173
Yes, Dana? Do you have
something to contribute?

30:39.206 --> 30:43.645
That boy, that Charlie Marlow.

30:43.678 --> 30:49.016
He do good work with those,
those Palmer loos.

30:49.049 --> 30:53.220
He do good work with that.

31:13.474 --> 31:15.175
No, no!

31:15.209 --> 31:17.244
I'm sorry, Sister Giorgia.

31:17.277 --> 31:18.513
I don't know.

31:18.546 --> 31:20.280
<i>Non avete il diritto!</i>

31:20.314 --> 31:23.016
Leave Romy alone,
or I will take you outside

31:23.050 --> 31:24.318
and put you on the bus.

31:24.351 --> 31:30.224
Stop.

31:30.257 --> 31:32.993
You all right?

31:48.142 --> 31:50.444
Have you come to help me?

31:53.013 --> 31:56.216
Thank you.

31:56.250 --> 32:01.989
Thank God who has sent you.

32:41.763 --> 32:47.201
Good work.

32:47.234 --> 32:51.438
Good, Cody.

32:57.679 --> 33:00.047
Cody, Cody.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.382
My sweet Cody.

33:02.416 --> 33:06.086
It's bedtime, all right?

33:06.119 --> 33:10.357
Can you put that away, sweetie?
Hmm?

33:10.390 --> 33:12.202
It's been ten minutes,
I think that's long enough.

33:12.226 --> 33:13.260
Come on.

33:13.293 --> 33:14.127
Here we go.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.496
Here we go, Cody.

33:15.530 --> 33:17.264
Sweetheart.

33:17.297 --> 33:18.131
Hey! Hey!

33:18.165 --> 33:20.802
No, no, no!

33:20.835 --> 33:24.572
No.

33:27.742 --> 33:30.344
Shh.

33:30.377 --> 33:32.045
Stop it.

33:32.079 --> 33:34.516
Shh.

33:38.285 --> 33:43.525
What's it going to take, Alison?

33:47.529 --> 33:50.197
A broken nose?

33:50.230 --> 33:55.637
Knocked out teeth?

33:55.670 --> 33:57.805
I've got this under control.

33:57.839 --> 34:00.608
I can see that.

34:00.642 --> 34:05.580
Have you looked
in the mirror lately?

34:05.613 --> 34:07.347
I don't know
if when I come home,

34:07.381 --> 34:09.216
I'm going to find the
police waiting for me

34:09.249 --> 34:11.719
with a domestic abuse warrant,

34:11.753 --> 34:15.122
or you lying comatose
on an ambulance gurney.

34:15.155 --> 34:17.592
Don't be ridiculous, Charles.

34:17.625 --> 34:19.192
What do you tell your friends?

34:19.226 --> 34:23.230
About the bruises,
the bite marks, the bald spots?

34:26.634 --> 34:30.337
Do you think I'm the only one
paying attention?

34:37.277 --> 34:40.480
Alison...

34:40.515 --> 34:46.119
it's just not working.

34:46.153 --> 34:50.223
You've done everything possible.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.826
No one could have done more.

34:51.859 --> 34:57.865
You've been amazing.

34:57.899 --> 35:00.602
But we just have
to start facing the fact

35:00.635 --> 35:02.469
- that maybe there's another...
- No, no, no.

35:02.503 --> 35:04.237
I will not accept that.

35:04.271 --> 35:09.142
I will not.

35:09.176 --> 35:12.847
I will not hand my son
off to some strangers.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.249
Alison, do you want him
to kill you?

35:16.283 --> 35:19.687
Stop it, Charles.

35:19.721 --> 35:26.493
Please.

35:26.527 --> 35:29.831
I can't...

35:29.864 --> 35:31.666
quit, I can't stop trying.

35:31.699 --> 35:34.569
I'm not asking you
to stop trying.

35:34.602 --> 35:36.336
I'm just saying that
there might be a place

35:36.370 --> 35:39.373
where he could be
better cared-for,

35:39.406 --> 35:41.509
and our family could be safe.

35:41.542 --> 35:43.811
He is our family.

35:43.845 --> 35:50.518
And he's only six years old.

35:50.551 --> 35:54.822
Sweetheart, we love our son.

35:54.856 --> 35:57.825
And we can still see him
every day,

35:57.859 --> 36:01.428
safely.

36:01.461 --> 36:05.900
Who's going to take care
of him when we're gone?

36:11.673 --> 36:17.945
Falling does not equal failing.

36:17.979 --> 36:19.847
Douche.

36:19.881 --> 36:20.782
You ready?

36:20.815 --> 36:21.949
Come in for me.

36:21.983 --> 36:23.584
You grab my wrist.

36:23.618 --> 36:24.795
Here's where you went,
to the inside.

36:24.819 --> 36:28.589
But you're supposed to go
to the outside of the elbow.

36:28.623 --> 36:30.257
Twist in.
You feel that pressure?

36:30.290 --> 36:31.893
Yeah.

36:31.926 --> 36:33.260
Come here.

36:33.293 --> 36:34.261
Force them to the ground.

36:34.294 --> 36:35.630
- You're falling.
- Yes.

36:35.663 --> 36:37.632
- Right?
- Right.

36:37.665 --> 36:39.834
Here's something interesting.

36:39.867 --> 36:43.504
In Aikido,
falling doesn't equal failing.

36:43.538 --> 36:46.574
See, we practice Ukeme,
which is the art of falling.

36:46.607 --> 36:48.776
It's not passive falling
or just giving in.

36:48.810 --> 36:54.982
If you're stiff and you're
inflexible, then you...

36:55.016 --> 36:56.383
- Hi.
- Hey.

36:56.416 --> 36:59.419
Umm, you cannot receive
properly.

36:59.453 --> 37:01.656
Which means that we could
potentially get hurt

37:01.689 --> 37:05.526
or disillusioned in any
sort of difficult situation.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.670
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah, yeah.

37:06.694 --> 37:09.396
So, so much, so much sense.

37:09.429 --> 37:10.965
Honey, would you like to try?

37:10.998 --> 37:13.500
Bruce is a great teacher.

37:13.534 --> 37:16.436
He came all the way down here,
so maybe...

37:16.470 --> 37:17.805
It's just not for me,
sweetheart.

37:17.839 --> 37:20.575
But I'm glad you're enjoying it,
really.

37:20.608 --> 37:21.943
Well, are you sure? It's easy.

37:21.976 --> 37:27.414
It's not hard.

37:28.683 --> 37:32.954
I'll just check on our son.

38:49.462 --> 38:51.398
Hello? Anyone home?

38:51.431 --> 38:56.369
I'm here.

38:56.403 --> 38:59.472
Did you see your snack?

38:59.507 --> 39:02.543
Yes, thank you.

39:02.577 --> 39:09.083
- Did your father call?
- No.

39:09.116 --> 39:10.952
Were you worried?

39:10.985 --> 39:12.153
No.

39:12.186 --> 39:14.822
Your father won't be home.

39:14.856 --> 39:17.490
He's at a Jaycees Meeting,

39:17.525 --> 39:21.428
for the Shriners, or Elks,
Caribous,

39:21.461 --> 39:24.031
one of those.

39:24.065 --> 39:28.769
So, it will just be you and me.

39:28.803 --> 39:34.141
And a couple of TV dinners.

39:34.175 --> 39:38.512
Aren't we lucky to live in
such an age of convenience?

39:38.546 --> 39:42.850
Isn't all this
just a dream come true?

39:42.884 --> 39:45.786
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

39:52.126 --> 39:55.428
Well, I'm going to
start making dinner.

39:55.462 --> 40:00.467
Okay.

40:00.500 --> 40:07.575
We've got Salisbury Steak
and Fried Chicken, Mexican.

40:10.211 --> 40:14.481
And now this very special award.

40:14.515 --> 40:16.183
The certificate of merit

40:16.217 --> 40:21.589
for Palmer penmanship goes to...

40:21.622 --> 40:23.724
Charles Simon Marlow.

40:25.860 --> 40:27.695
Yay, Charlie!

40:27.728 --> 40:31.065
Congratulations.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.465
Charlie!

40:32.499 --> 40:35.202
Charlie Marlow!

40:35.236 --> 40:36.604
Yay!

40:36.637 --> 40:38.539
Charlie Marlow!

40:38.572 --> 40:40.908
Charlie Marlow!

40:40.942 --> 40:41.943
Yay!

40:41.976 --> 40:44.477
The retard loves him.

40:44.512 --> 40:46.814
The retard is his girlfriend.

40:46.847 --> 40:48.115
Charlie!

40:48.149 --> 40:51.619
Charlie Marlow! Charlie!

40:51.652 --> 40:53.154
Dana, that's enough.

40:53.187 --> 40:54.531
I'm sure we're all
very proud of Charles.

40:54.555 --> 40:56.524
Charlie Marlow!

40:56.557 --> 40:58.893
Dana McGucken, quiet down now.

40:58.926 --> 41:01.796
Charlie Marlow! Charlie Marlow!

41:01.829 --> 41:03.264
Dana McGucken! Silence!

41:03.297 --> 41:05.833
Now!

41:14.208 --> 41:15.977
Oh, you just had
to have one drink!

41:16.010 --> 41:18.045
One drink, you said
and now look at you!

41:18.079 --> 41:19.890
- You can't even stand up!
- Would you just relax?

41:19.914 --> 41:21.849
It's not a big deal!

41:21.882 --> 41:23.560
- Oh, it's not a big deal?
- I'll take care of it.

41:23.584 --> 41:24.752
I'll take care of it.

41:24.785 --> 41:26.163
Oh, how are you going to
take care of it?

41:26.187 --> 41:27.788
I'll go to the liquor store
right now.

41:27.822 --> 41:29.824
Oh that's a great idea,
you're drunk as a skunk

41:29.857 --> 41:32.226
you can't drive,
you can't even stand up!

41:32.259 --> 41:33.971
- Look at you!
- That's a nice dress, Honey.

41:33.995 --> 41:35.635
- Get out of here!
- All right, all right.

41:35.663 --> 41:37.298
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Go take a nap!

41:37.331 --> 41:39.767
I took a nap already.
You woke me up.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.236
- I'm going to go cut the grass.
- Cut the grass?

41:42.269 --> 41:44.214
- What are you talking about!
- I'm the only one who does

41:44.238 --> 41:45.916
- any work around here anyway!
- Does any work around here?

41:45.940 --> 41:49.977
You don't even have a job!

42:00.021 --> 42:02.590
Hey, Charlie.

42:02.623 --> 42:04.592
Don't worry,
I didn't cut my foot off.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.927
I just tripped.

42:06.961 --> 42:09.163
Hey, make me a drink, will you?

42:09.196 --> 42:11.032
Now that your mom's gone.

42:11.065 --> 42:12.099
CHARLIE Okay.

42:12.133 --> 42:13.200
Bloody Mary.

42:13.234 --> 42:16.170
It's a new one, okay?

42:16.203 --> 42:17.671
Step one.

42:17.705 --> 42:21.008
Salt on the rim.

42:21.042 --> 42:27.915
Use that first, otherwise
it'll all spill it every...

42:27.948 --> 42:29.617
Celery.

42:29.650 --> 42:32.853
Vodka, or gin.

42:32.887 --> 42:34.288
Vodka.

42:34.321 --> 42:37.825
Okay?

42:37.858 --> 42:38.893
That's good.

42:38.926 --> 42:40.327
Thanks, Pal.

42:40.361 --> 42:42.963
Needs some tomato juice too.

42:42.997 --> 42:45.966
And olives, it's got olives.

43:15.830 --> 43:17.731
- Hey.
- Hi. You ready?

43:21.702 --> 43:22.703
No, thank you.

43:22.736 --> 43:24.038
I ate.

43:24.071 --> 43:27.341
I'm extending an olive jar.

43:28.676 --> 43:30.111
- And I'm okay.
- Okay.

43:30.144 --> 43:31.745
Thank you.

43:34.849 --> 43:36.750
What's with all the boxes?

43:36.784 --> 43:38.085
What?

43:38.119 --> 43:40.087
- The boxes.
- Oh, um...

43:41.188 --> 43:42.756
Just doing a little purging.

43:42.790 --> 43:44.825
I might have a yard sale.

43:44.859 --> 43:47.328
Oh, well, if you find
anything belonging to me,

43:47.361 --> 43:50.264
just get rid of it.

43:50.297 --> 43:51.765
Oh, really?

43:51.799 --> 43:53.334
If I haven't used it
in a decade,

43:53.367 --> 43:56.737
it's nothing I need.

43:57.905 --> 43:59.373
You sure?

44:01.242 --> 44:02.943
What about, um...

44:04.445 --> 44:06.180
this?

44:08.782 --> 44:10.985
Come on, I thought you looked
gorgeous in it.

44:12.186 --> 44:14.321
We should probably get going.

44:23.731 --> 44:25.866
So, you've made up
your mind already?

44:27.868 --> 44:29.904
We're building
our own group home?

44:32.273 --> 44:35.042
No, that's not true.

44:35.075 --> 44:36.353
Let's just
not waste time pretending

44:36.377 --> 44:38.179
that there's some kind
of a collaboration

44:38.212 --> 44:39.780
- going on here.
- Oh, I see.

44:39.813 --> 44:43.417
So, finding a home for our son
to permanently live in

44:43.450 --> 44:44.285
is a waste of time.

44:44.318 --> 44:46.487
- Is that right?
- No, that's not...

44:46.521 --> 44:49.390
It's fine, really. Just...

44:49.423 --> 44:52.426
Let me know what you decide
and we'll go with that.

44:56.931 --> 44:58.432
Okay.

45:08.042 --> 45:10.211
Hi, Charlie.

45:10.244 --> 45:12.012
Look, look at this.

45:12.046 --> 45:14.148
It's loo.

45:14.181 --> 45:15.282
Loo.

45:15.316 --> 45:19.153
Um, oh, okay,
I'll open it for you.

45:25.192 --> 45:26.293
No, Charlie.

45:26.327 --> 45:30.998
See, it's loo.

45:31.031 --> 45:32.099
Oh.

45:32.132 --> 45:34.134
Loops.

45:34.168 --> 45:35.936
You say it.

45:38.172 --> 45:41.408
Loooooooooops.

45:41.442 --> 45:42.510
Yeah.

45:42.544 --> 45:44.345
I like to peel them off
sometimes.

45:44.378 --> 45:46.113
Do you ever do that?

45:46.146 --> 45:47.147
No.

45:47.181 --> 45:49.016
Show.

45:49.049 --> 45:50.451
Okay.

45:52.219 --> 45:56.290
Well, you gotta go real slow.

45:56.323 --> 45:57.291
Like this.

45:57.324 --> 45:59.460
Or else they break.

46:11.573 --> 46:13.207
Hey, you did it!

46:13.240 --> 46:14.808
Atta boy!

46:14.842 --> 46:16.010
Yeah!

46:16.043 --> 46:18.145
Atta boy, me!

46:23.017 --> 46:26.854
Show me those Palmer loops.

46:26.887 --> 46:29.823
Uh, um...

46:43.270 --> 46:45.005
Oh.

46:59.621 --> 47:01.088
Well?

47:01.121 --> 47:02.189
Hm.

47:02.222 --> 47:05.993
I mean, that was... that was
pretty close to perfect,

47:06.026 --> 47:07.428
wasn't it?

47:07.461 --> 47:09.564
The fact that
the Youngs and the Gurnees

47:09.597 --> 47:11.365
are willing to pitch in on this,

47:11.398 --> 47:14.602
and Miles and Robbie don't even
age out for another year.

47:14.636 --> 47:16.337
I mean, Cody is nearly 18,

47:16.370 --> 47:18.272
and if he ages
out of state support,

47:18.305 --> 47:21.475
we're in so much trouble.

47:21.509 --> 47:23.911
The weather is really something,
isn't it?

47:27.114 --> 47:28.516
Have you been drinking?

47:28.550 --> 47:32.019
- Have I been drinking?
- All right, look, I...

47:32.052 --> 47:33.954
Would that be a problem
if I was drinking?

47:33.987 --> 47:35.231
I'm not accusing you
of anything, Charles.

47:35.255 --> 47:37.525
Okay, so there's
no need to bristle.

47:37.559 --> 47:39.561
I'm not bristling.

47:41.128 --> 47:44.331
Point of fact,
I did have a few glasses

47:44.365 --> 47:48.001
of the Cab Syrah blend earlier

47:48.035 --> 47:50.337
while I was grading papers.

47:54.007 --> 47:55.610
How's school?

47:55.643 --> 47:57.645
It's good.

47:57.679 --> 48:00.682
What are you and your students
doing right now?

48:00.715 --> 48:03.685
We're actually working on
"First, Middle, Last."

48:03.718 --> 48:04.985
Oh, okay, good.

48:05.018 --> 48:06.920
I like that game.

48:06.954 --> 48:08.255
Any especially good ones?

48:08.288 --> 48:09.456
Yeah.

48:09.490 --> 48:11.058
Megan Merry McCormick had.

48:11.091 --> 48:13.160
Mellifluous Magnanimous Mammoth,

48:13.193 --> 48:15.262
which I thought was nice.

48:15.295 --> 48:16.363
Well, that's not fair.

48:16.397 --> 48:20.568
I mean, she's got three names
that start with M.

48:20.602 --> 48:21.969
All right, let's go.

48:22.002 --> 48:25.205
Alison Nancy ForchÃ©.

48:25.239 --> 48:27.975
Absurdly Narcissistic...

48:28.008 --> 48:30.444
Mm.

48:30.477 --> 48:31.412
Friend.

48:31.445 --> 48:33.046
Mm!

48:33.080 --> 48:35.717
For you, I would like...

48:35.750 --> 48:38.385
Cursed.

48:38.419 --> 48:40.421
Salacious, uh,

48:40.454 --> 48:42.289
Minotaur.

48:42.322 --> 48:47.695
Amorphous, Nagging, Fantasy.

48:47.729 --> 48:49.263
Okay.

48:49.296 --> 48:52.232
Callous...

48:52.266 --> 48:56.303
Sarcastic...

48:56.336 --> 48:57.672
Madman.

49:02.710 --> 49:04.445
And we're here.

49:10.117 --> 49:11.018
Hi, Cody.

49:11.051 --> 49:12.286
Miles.

49:12.319 --> 49:14.656
Robbie. Hi!

49:14.689 --> 49:16.558
How are you guys?
How was school?

49:16.591 --> 49:19.493
Oh my goodness, Raisa,
this smells amazing.

49:19.527 --> 49:21.028
Thank you.

49:21.061 --> 49:22.630
This is Cody's spoon.

49:27.401 --> 49:29.269
Okay, honey.

49:29.303 --> 49:31.773
Look at that.

49:31.806 --> 49:33.708
These mashed potatoes
look so good.

49:33.741 --> 49:34.843
Come on.

49:34.876 --> 49:39.213
I think I might have to steal
some of them from you.

49:39.246 --> 49:40.615
Hmm?

49:40.648 --> 49:42.358
Are these my mashed potatoes,
or are these...

49:42.382 --> 49:45.352
oh, okay, there we go.

49:45.385 --> 49:47.755
How 'bout a bite?

49:47.789 --> 49:50.057
Yeah?

49:50.090 --> 49:51.526
Oh, that bite is mine.

49:51.559 --> 49:53.093
I want that bite.

49:53.126 --> 49:54.796
Ahh!

49:56.430 --> 49:59.433
Ahh! You tricky tricky.

49:59.466 --> 50:00.735
Here we go.

50:00.768 --> 50:02.102
Okay, this one's mine.

50:02.135 --> 50:03.505
I know it. I can feel it.

50:03.538 --> 50:04.639
Mom's gonna win this one.

50:04.672 --> 50:05.573
Let me have it.

50:05.607 --> 50:07.207
Ohh!

50:07.241 --> 50:08.442
Miles, did you see that?

50:08.475 --> 50:11.779
You taught him that, didn't you?

50:11.813 --> 50:13.480
I'm gonna win this time.

50:13.515 --> 50:14.716
I know I'm gonna win.

50:14.749 --> 50:16.316
I'm gonna win.
This one's mine...

50:16.350 --> 50:17.251
This one's mine.

50:17.284 --> 50:18.452
Yes.

50:33.601 --> 50:35.670
Wow.

50:35.703 --> 50:37.271
Thank you, sweetheart.

50:37.304 --> 50:38.773
Here, baby.

50:38.806 --> 50:42.677
You just have a little bit
on your face, okay?

50:42.710 --> 50:43.845
Good job.

50:43.878 --> 50:45.445
Good, good.

50:45.479 --> 50:47.549
Look, you did so good.

50:47.582 --> 50:50.585
Dessert, okay?

50:52.587 --> 50:55.389
Guess what?

50:55.422 --> 50:56.290
Here, let me have this.

50:56.323 --> 51:01.563
I, um... I brought
somebody with me today.

51:01.596 --> 51:06.668
Someone that I think

51:06.701 --> 51:11.171
you're gonna be
really excited to see.

51:11.204 --> 51:14.241
- Hey, pal.
- Look, Cody.

51:14.274 --> 51:17.545
Sweetheart, it's Dad.

51:17.579 --> 51:20.682
- How are you doing?
- Honey.

51:20.715 --> 51:22.817
Oh, Cody. Cody.

51:22.850 --> 51:24.193
Somebody really likes
their dessert, huh?

51:24.217 --> 51:26.186
Come here, baby, don't do that.

51:26.219 --> 51:27.622
Let's get you a new bib.

51:27.655 --> 51:29.289
No, no, no, no, no!

51:30.825 --> 51:31.893
It's okay, baby.

51:31.926 --> 51:32.827
It's all right.

51:32.860 --> 51:33.728
I'm here.

51:33.761 --> 51:36.163
Do not touch his scars ever!

51:36.196 --> 51:37.331
You didn't tell her that!

51:47.909 --> 51:49.711
Hi.

51:52.312 --> 51:53.581
How was it?

51:53.615 --> 51:56.483
It was a long day.

51:56.517 --> 52:00.287
How did he do on the drive over?

52:00.320 --> 52:01.522
Fussed a little,

52:01.556 --> 52:03.891
but he's been great
since we got home.

52:05.392 --> 52:06.293
Look, Cody.

52:06.326 --> 52:07.929
It's Mom.

52:07.962 --> 52:11.532
Hi, honey.

52:11.566 --> 52:15.703
So, uh... what have you guys
been up to?

52:15.737 --> 52:18.740
Nothing much. Just hanging.

52:18.773 --> 52:21.509
We made pesto for dinner,
didn't we, pal?

52:21.542 --> 52:22.810
Huh?

52:22.844 --> 52:26.413
Just like they've got
at the group home?

52:26.446 --> 52:27.582
Hey, Cody.

52:30.752 --> 52:32.620
Cody, sweetheart.

52:32.654 --> 52:35.890
Are you having fun
visiting, baby?

52:35.923 --> 52:36.824
Cody?

52:36.858 --> 52:37.792
Mom's talking to you, son.

52:37.825 --> 52:39.827
Can you... you take a break?

52:39.861 --> 52:40.895
Honey?

52:40.928 --> 52:41.796
Okay, all right.

52:41.829 --> 52:42.830
Let me have this, baby.

52:46.934 --> 52:48.569
Seriously, Charles.

52:48.603 --> 52:49.913
- Just let me take care of it.
- No, no, no, no.

52:49.937 --> 52:51.539
Please, no.

52:51.572 --> 52:53.775
Don't bother.

52:56.443 --> 52:57.655
Are you going
to tell me how long

52:57.679 --> 53:00.480
you've been letting him stim?

53:05.352 --> 53:06.788
I don't know.

53:08.022 --> 53:09.222
I'm sorry.

53:09.256 --> 53:10.625
I fell asleep.

53:10.658 --> 53:11.969
I don't understand
why it's so hard

53:11.993 --> 53:14.762
for you to comply
with the rules.

53:14.796 --> 53:17.865
To comply with the rules?

53:24.605 --> 53:25.840
What are we talking about?

53:25.873 --> 53:27.875
I do this one thing, Charles.

53:27.909 --> 53:30.645
This one thing for myself.

53:30.678 --> 53:31.713
The Aikido.

53:31.746 --> 53:33.346
It takes up
all of your free time.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.016
But that's... it's fine.

53:35.049 --> 53:36.718
And it is not as though
I haven't logged

53:36.751 --> 53:37.952
just as many hours as you.

53:37.985 --> 53:40.855
But when I am here,
I am present.

53:40.888 --> 53:41.923
I keep him engaged.

53:41.956 --> 53:46.426
I don't just let him stim
for hours and hours.

53:46.460 --> 53:48.495
Alison, it helps him.

53:48.529 --> 53:50.330
It helps him.

53:50.363 --> 53:52.767
I honestly... I don't see
what's wrong with that.

53:58.573 --> 54:01.576
I don't know
how I can trust you.

54:01.609 --> 54:03.276
How you can trust me?

54:03.310 --> 54:05.613
You don't get to just say that
and walk away!

54:05.646 --> 54:07.314
I just...

54:08.883 --> 54:13.386
I just want a straight answer,
Charles.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.422
How long did you let him stim?

54:15.455 --> 54:20.061
Why can't you just accept him
the way he is?

54:20.094 --> 54:23.064
The way he is is sick.

54:23.097 --> 54:25.398
He is sick, Charles.

54:25.432 --> 54:27.434
Would you say that
if he had cancer?

54:27.467 --> 54:28.645
You would just
shrug your shoulders

54:28.669 --> 54:29.747
and you would say, "Oh well".

54:29.771 --> 54:30.781
- It's not the same.
- "We should just accept him

54:30.805 --> 54:33.074
- "the way he is."
- Alison, it's not the same.

54:33.107 --> 54:35.408
- You know that.
- Cody needs us to fight for him.

54:35.442 --> 54:37.779
I want him to be able
to move home someday.

54:37.812 --> 54:38.813
- Do you?
- So do I.

54:38.846 --> 54:39.680
Of course. Of course I do.

54:39.714 --> 54:40.615
Do you? Do you?

54:40.648 --> 54:43.651
And I work just as hard
as you do with him.

54:43.684 --> 54:45.853
Really?

54:45.887 --> 54:46.821
- Yes.
- Because all I see

54:46.854 --> 54:49.757
when I come home
is you just lying around,

54:49.791 --> 54:52.325
and he's sitting in a corner
smashing noodles.

54:52.359 --> 54:53.728
You call that working with him?

54:53.761 --> 54:56.764
Yes! Everything doesn't
have to be so hard for him

54:56.798 --> 54:58.398
all the time, Alison.

54:58.431 --> 55:00.568
Why can't... why can't he just
have some down time,

55:00.601 --> 55:01.669
like any other kid?

55:01.702 --> 55:04.939
Why can't he just do things
that make him happy

55:04.972 --> 55:07.407
when he gets home?

55:07.440 --> 55:11.045
Because as long as he's happy,

55:11.078 --> 55:14.347
sitting in a corner
with his version of a pacifier

55:14.381 --> 55:15.583
jammed in his mouth,

55:15.616 --> 55:17.552
then he's manageable.

55:17.585 --> 55:19.129
Of course, he never grows,
he never advances.

55:19.153 --> 55:22.056
But then that's just like you,
now isn't it, Charles?

55:22.089 --> 55:24.759
He is a mirror image of you.

55:24.792 --> 55:26.694
No cares.

55:26.727 --> 55:27.895
No challenges.

55:27.929 --> 55:30.430
Just hours and hours
of solitude.

55:30.463 --> 55:32.934
- And then...
- You're so spoiled.

55:34.902 --> 55:37.038
You're so spoiled.

55:37.071 --> 55:38.306
Excuse me?

55:38.338 --> 55:43.711
If you couldn't constantly ask
Daddy for this or for that,

55:43.744 --> 55:45.546
then we'd have
to do it together.

55:45.580 --> 55:48.683
Instead, you're always bringing
home some new miracle cure.

55:48.716 --> 55:50.017
- Wait. Quiet.
- No.

55:50.051 --> 55:50.751
- Quiet.
- Alison, you actually need

55:50.785 --> 55:52.485
- to listen to this now.
- Quiet!

55:52.520 --> 55:54.822
Do you smell that?

55:58.192 --> 55:59.760
You cannot touch him
on his scars!

55:59.794 --> 56:01.596
You can never touch his scars!

56:01.629 --> 56:02.739
Didn't... you didn't tell her?

56:02.763 --> 56:04.098
Nobody told her!

56:04.131 --> 56:05.542
Cody, sweetheart,
come here, come here.

56:05.566 --> 56:06.610
It's all right, baby. Come here.

56:06.634 --> 56:07.535
No, no, no, no, no.

56:07.568 --> 56:08.435
Hey, Cody, it's all right.

56:08.468 --> 56:09.580
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here, baby.

56:09.604 --> 56:11.172
Let's go. Let's go.

56:11.205 --> 56:13.140
Come on, sweetie, come on.

56:13.174 --> 56:16.577
Why did you guys not ever
mention anything to her?

56:16.611 --> 56:17.645
Get some towels!

56:17.678 --> 56:19.914
Be useful! Get some towels!

56:24.685 --> 56:25.920
Come on. Breathe, Miles.

56:25.953 --> 56:27.989
Breathe, breathe!

56:31.025 --> 56:34.562
Oh, leave that, Mr. Marlow.

56:34.595 --> 56:35.997
You go on.

56:51.145 --> 56:54.782
There is this new movement
called "photo-lanthropy."

56:54.815 --> 56:58.085
Photography that draws attention
to a cause or issue.

56:58.119 --> 56:59.987
You make yourself invisible.

57:00.021 --> 57:01.956
Let the camera do the work.

57:01.989 --> 57:03.925
Or "photojournalism."

57:05.993 --> 57:07.662
Never mind.

57:07.695 --> 57:11.532
Um, how's it going with...

57:11.565 --> 57:13.134
Sister Giorgia.

57:13.167 --> 57:14.835
Oh, I thought I told you.

57:14.869 --> 57:18.706
She and, uh... is collaborating
with another artist.

57:18.739 --> 57:20.473
She's calmer now.

57:20.508 --> 57:23.544
And The Seattle Times
wants to interview me.

57:23.577 --> 57:24.912
And maybe you.

57:24.946 --> 57:27.181
And maybe even print
one of the pictures?

57:29.550 --> 57:31.519
They can interview you.

57:34.655 --> 57:35.790
No.

57:39.593 --> 57:40.895
No.

57:45.666 --> 57:49.103
Si. Ahh!

57:49.136 --> 57:51.105
That one's beautiful.

57:51.138 --> 57:53.240
Si. Bella.

57:53.274 --> 57:55.643
Where do you think
this should go?

57:57.845 --> 57:59.947
Hmm.

57:59.981 --> 58:02.616
Remember?

58:02.650 --> 58:05.086
You're going to take
this picture,

58:05.119 --> 58:07.788
the ones we cut out?

58:07.822 --> 58:11.726
You're going to glue them
like this.

58:11.759 --> 58:14.829
To make a new, bigger picture.

58:14.862 --> 58:16.797
A collage.

58:18.799 --> 58:20.668
See?

58:20.701 --> 58:21.969
Si.

58:22.003 --> 58:23.704
Perfecto.

58:32.847 --> 58:35.616
Hey, guys.

58:53.334 --> 58:55.002
Colla.

59:00.741 --> 59:02.910
Cody.

59:08.949 --> 59:11.085
Hello, Sister Giorgia.

59:11.118 --> 59:12.987
Hey, Cody.

59:13.020 --> 59:15.189
You see that collage
she's making?

59:15.222 --> 59:16.924
You'll get to make one too.

59:22.963 --> 59:26.867
Hey, Cody, where you going,
big guy?

59:32.640 --> 59:34.241
Hey, give those to me.

59:34.275 --> 59:35.776
Come on, you know the rules.

59:35.810 --> 59:37.978
It's okay. It's okay.

59:38.012 --> 59:40.081
He can have all of those
if he wants.

59:40.114 --> 59:42.149
I have plenty.

1:00:37.071 --> 1:00:38.272
Ga.

1:00:40.174 --> 1:00:41.442
Ahh.

1:00:44.078 --> 1:00:45.078
Ahh.

1:00:58.192 --> 1:00:59.760
Ahh.

1:01:17.178 --> 1:01:18.112
Yes, please. Yes.

1:01:18.145 --> 1:01:19.113
I think you need more.

1:01:19.146 --> 1:01:20.915
You should not see
the bottom of that glass.

1:01:22.816 --> 1:01:24.218
You are in charge of that.

1:01:24.251 --> 1:01:26.120
There's a few more bottles
tucked away.

1:01:26.153 --> 1:01:29.423
So whose idea was it to build
our own group home?

1:01:29.456 --> 1:01:31.125
Uh, that was me.

1:01:31.158 --> 1:01:34.094
- Not him, right?
- No, no. Of course not.

1:01:34.128 --> 1:01:37.765
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

1:01:37.798 --> 1:01:39.376
Well, I don't know about you,
but I need some more wine.

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:41.502
I'll take some,
out of the bottle.

1:01:41.536 --> 1:01:43.204
Out of the bottle?

1:01:43.237 --> 1:01:44.972
I wouldn't do it that way.

1:01:47.374 --> 1:01:49.176
Have you ever wondered why?

1:01:49.210 --> 1:01:52.246
Why our children?

1:01:52.279 --> 1:01:53.881
I mean, I'm curious.

1:01:53.914 --> 1:01:56.917
Where do you all stand
on the issue of God?

1:02:01.956 --> 1:02:04.458
Sorry... God?

1:02:04.491 --> 1:02:08.829
Are you folks practitioners
in any kind of organized...

1:02:08.862 --> 1:02:11.332
organization around all that?

1:02:11.365 --> 1:02:13.167
You mean church?

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:14.768
- Well, yeah.
- Charles, this may not

1:02:14.802 --> 1:02:15.970
be the time.

1:02:16.003 --> 1:02:17.438
Have you found it helpful?

1:02:17.471 --> 1:02:19.139
Found what helpful?

1:02:19.173 --> 1:02:21.308
Your belief in God.

1:02:21.342 --> 1:02:23.053
I mean, I'm sorry,
maybe I'm misinformed here.

1:02:23.077 --> 1:02:25.913
I always thought people who went
to church believed in God.

1:02:25.946 --> 1:02:27.982
We're Unitarians.

1:02:28.015 --> 1:02:29.083
Oh.

1:02:29.116 --> 1:02:32.052
I'll spare you my repertoire
of Unitarian jokes.

1:02:33.454 --> 1:02:35.289
We've probably
heard most of them.

1:02:35.322 --> 1:02:36.500
- Probably.
- I'll bet you have.

1:02:36.524 --> 1:02:39.460
I'm just wondering, like,
have you found it a comfort?

1:02:41.295 --> 1:02:45.099
Membership in the...
what do Unitarians call it?

1:02:45.132 --> 1:02:48.269
The "Good Some Call God" club?

1:02:48.302 --> 1:02:50.371
Charles...

1:02:50.404 --> 1:02:52.306
- Yes.
- Really?

1:02:52.339 --> 1:02:54.408
Yes, really.

1:02:54.441 --> 1:02:56.977
We don't go to church
that often.

1:02:57.011 --> 1:02:59.480
But it isn't out of any kind
of lack of faith

1:02:59.514 --> 1:03:01.583
or religious belief.

1:03:01.616 --> 1:03:04.285
But we were both
raised with that.

1:03:04.318 --> 1:03:06.854
It's really about time,
actually.

1:03:06.887 --> 1:03:08.856
How we spend our Sundays.

1:03:08.889 --> 1:03:11.258
So it's a matter of convenience?

1:03:11.292 --> 1:03:13.127
Well, when you put it
like that...

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:15.597
I'm just curious because
Alison has actually decided

1:03:15.630 --> 1:03:18.299
to go full tilt
in the religious direction.

1:03:18.332 --> 1:03:22.970
Have you told your friends
about that, honey?

1:03:24.438 --> 1:03:27.509
Um, n-no, I haven't.

1:03:27.542 --> 1:03:30.612
I, uh...

1:03:30.645 --> 1:03:35.182
I am in the process
of converting to Judaism.

1:03:35.215 --> 1:03:36.584
- Really?
- Wow.

1:03:36.618 --> 1:03:38.152
That's wonderful.

1:03:38.185 --> 1:03:40.187
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:41.523
Isn't that something?

1:03:41.556 --> 1:03:42.990
Isn't it?

1:03:43.023 --> 1:03:44.502
If nothing else,
it's going to do amazing things

1:03:44.526 --> 1:03:46.460
for her sense of humor.

1:03:54.034 --> 1:03:57.004
Well. L'Chaim.

1:03:57.037 --> 1:03:58.939
L'Chaim!

1:04:07.948 --> 1:04:10.984
Alrighty, thank you, guys.

1:04:12.052 --> 1:04:13.120
I'll see you later.

1:04:13.153 --> 1:04:15.022
Have a good weekend. Bye.

1:04:18.359 --> 1:04:20.327
That was nice.

1:04:23.364 --> 1:04:25.199
I can't believe you did that.

1:04:27.134 --> 1:04:30.572
You ambushed me, Charles.

1:04:30.605 --> 1:04:32.906
You embarrassed me
in front of everybody.

1:04:32.940 --> 1:04:35.976
And on a day that was supposed
to be a celebration.

1:04:36.009 --> 1:04:36.811
What?

1:04:36.845 --> 1:04:38.912
Me bringing up
the religion thing?

1:04:40.981 --> 1:04:43.585
What, are you embarrassed
about it?

1:04:43.618 --> 1:04:47.622
I-I'm not embarrassed about it.

1:04:47.655 --> 1:04:49.356
When I told you
that I was converting,

1:04:49.390 --> 1:04:52.426
you promised me
that you would not make fun.

1:04:52.459 --> 1:04:55.295
What you did right there,

1:04:55.329 --> 1:04:56.564
that was spiteful.

1:04:56.598 --> 1:04:58.609
Okay, don't you think you're
overreacting just a little bit?

1:04:58.633 --> 1:05:00.434
- No.
- No?

1:05:00.467 --> 1:05:02.069
I'm reacting.

1:05:02.102 --> 1:05:05.973
And my reactions
are perfectly appropriate.

1:05:06.006 --> 1:05:07.642
TouchÃ©, darling.

1:05:07.675 --> 1:05:12.614
And I cannot be responsible
for your reactions.

1:05:15.717 --> 1:05:18.520
You promised.

1:05:24.258 --> 1:05:28.563
I prefer written correspondence
to dramatic exits.

1:05:33.267 --> 1:05:35.235
You promised too.

1:05:54.221 --> 1:05:55.456
Hey.

1:05:57.659 --> 1:05:59.359
Hi.

1:05:59.393 --> 1:06:02.597
By the way, where's your, um,
where's your friend?

1:06:02.630 --> 1:06:04.998
He could probably
help out a little here.

1:06:05.032 --> 1:06:06.166
My friend?

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:07.769
Yeah, Mr. Aikido.

1:06:07.802 --> 1:06:09.336
What's his name?

1:06:09.369 --> 1:06:10.605
Barry.

1:06:10.638 --> 1:06:11.639
Bruce.

1:06:11.673 --> 1:06:12.673
Bruce!

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:16.477
He's in California now.

1:06:20.815 --> 1:06:22.216
Okay.

1:06:26.453 --> 1:06:28.188
I must begin, Mrs. Marlow,

1:06:28.222 --> 1:06:30.758
by saying what an absolute
delight it has been

1:06:30.792 --> 1:06:33.393
having Charles
in my classroom this year.

1:06:33.427 --> 1:06:36.029
Charles is a great help to me.

1:06:36.063 --> 1:06:39.567
Charles, I have selected you
to be part of a pilot program

1:06:39.601 --> 1:06:41.268
in our school.

1:06:41.301 --> 1:06:45.272
An experimental curriculum
called Language Arts.

1:06:45.305 --> 1:06:47.575
Only the best and brightest
fourth-graders

1:06:47.609 --> 1:06:49.343
will leave their
classroom each day

1:06:49.376 --> 1:06:52.379
and meet with me
in the Language Arts room.

1:06:52.412 --> 1:06:56.316
This new curriculum, rather
than diagramming sentences,

1:06:56.350 --> 1:07:00.387
gives the children a chance
to experience and absorb

1:07:00.420 --> 1:07:04.592
the mechanics of English
in an intuitive manner.

1:07:04.626 --> 1:07:07.127
By reading excerpts
from literature...

1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:09.129
I liked diagramming sentences.

1:07:11.431 --> 1:07:14.101
It was more direct.

1:07:19.841 --> 1:07:22.409
Well, thank you for your time,
Mrs. Braxton.

1:07:22.442 --> 1:07:28.348
Um... I'm glad that Charles
is doing well.

1:07:28.382 --> 1:07:31.719
There's one last thing
I think you should know.

1:07:31.753 --> 1:07:32.787
Yes?

1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:37.859
Charles has taken on
quite an unusual and heroic role

1:07:37.892 --> 1:07:40.528
in our classroom.

1:07:40.562 --> 1:07:42.162
Charles.

1:07:42.195 --> 1:07:44.164
- Heroic?
- Oh yes.

1:07:44.197 --> 1:07:45.800
Without any prompting from me,

1:07:45.833 --> 1:07:50.304
Charles has become quite a help
to Dana McGucken.

1:07:50.337 --> 1:07:51.338
I'm... I'm sorry.

1:07:51.371 --> 1:07:53.675
I don't... I don't understand.

1:07:53.708 --> 1:07:55.877
Oh, you haven't said anything.

1:07:55.910 --> 1:07:59.379
That's very like you Charles,
to be so humble.

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:05.753
Dana is one
of our special children,

1:08:05.787 --> 1:08:07.287
Mrs. Marlow.

1:08:07.321 --> 1:08:09.624
Thanks to Charles'
attention and friendship,

1:08:09.657 --> 1:08:12.560
Dana has made
tremendous improvement.

1:08:14.494 --> 1:08:18.298
You have a lovely boy there,
Mrs. Marlow.

1:08:26.239 --> 1:08:26.874
Yes.

1:08:26.908 --> 1:08:29.711
Yes. Well...

1:08:30.745 --> 1:08:34.281
Thank you again for your time,
Mrs. Braxton.

1:08:34.314 --> 1:08:35.349
Of course.

1:08:35.382 --> 1:08:36.517
Goodnight.

1:08:41.288 --> 1:08:43.791
Where the hell is
your goddamn father?

1:08:43.825 --> 1:08:47.595
And who is that boy your teacher
was talking about?

1:08:47.629 --> 1:08:49.363
Hello, Charlie.

1:08:49.396 --> 1:08:51.431
Look. Look at this boy.

1:08:51.465 --> 1:08:53.300
It's Charlie Marlow.

1:08:53.333 --> 1:08:54.368
Come on, Mom.

1:08:54.401 --> 1:08:55.803
Say hi.

1:08:55.837 --> 1:08:58.673
It's very good to meet you,
Charles.

1:08:58.706 --> 1:09:01.743
Dana's told me
so much about you.

1:09:01.776 --> 1:09:03.578
Hello.

1:09:03.611 --> 1:09:05.546
It's Charlie Marlow, Mom.

1:09:05.580 --> 1:09:08.348
We make loops.

1:09:12.887 --> 1:09:14.421
How do you do?

1:09:14.454 --> 1:09:17.925
- Sylvie McGucken.
- Hello. Rita Marlow.

1:09:17.959 --> 1:09:21.829
Charles has been such
a wonderful friend to Dana.

1:09:21.863 --> 1:09:24.464
He talks about him all the time.

1:09:26.299 --> 1:09:29.403
Me and Charlie make loops.

1:09:29.436 --> 1:09:31.906
Well, that is... that is nice.

1:09:34.676 --> 1:09:37.879
Oh, we don't want to keep you,
so, uh...

1:09:37.912 --> 1:09:40.414
Goodnight.

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:44.118
All right, Dana.

1:09:44.152 --> 1:09:46.486
Say goodbye to Charlie
and his mother.

1:09:46.521 --> 1:09:47.855
We have to go see Mrs. Braxton.

1:09:47.889 --> 1:09:48.756
Okay.

1:09:48.790 --> 1:09:50.558
Bye, Charlie.

1:09:50.591 --> 1:09:53.193
Bye, Charlie mom.

1:10:00.535 --> 1:10:01.803
That boy you were talking to.

1:10:01.836 --> 1:10:03.905
That... that Dana?

1:10:03.938 --> 1:10:05.840
Oh, God.

1:10:05.873 --> 1:10:08.843
Is he really a friend of yours?

1:10:08.876 --> 1:10:10.678
Yeah, kind of.

1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:15.917
Well, I would be careful
if I were you.

1:10:18.553 --> 1:10:20.755
About spending time with him.

1:10:20.788 --> 1:10:24.625
I mean, a boy like that, ugh.

1:10:35.302 --> 1:10:38.940
You know that's... that's
really nice about that, um...

1:10:38.973 --> 1:10:43.443
that... that... that
Language Arts thing.

1:10:43.477 --> 1:10:45.278
That is really something.

1:10:47.014 --> 1:10:49.282
I'm proud of you, Charles.

1:10:50.618 --> 1:10:52.954
Really, I am.

1:10:52.987 --> 1:10:57.324
I mean, who knew that
I gave birth to a genius?

1:10:57.357 --> 1:10:58.836
Although I shouldn't be
surprised, since your father is

1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:01.294
such a goddamn smarty pants.

1:11:04.766 --> 1:11:06.000
Where the hell have you been?

1:11:06.033 --> 1:11:07.267
Where the hell have you been?!

1:11:07.300 --> 1:11:09.513
I've been right here at home
waiting for some damn dinner!

1:11:09.537 --> 1:11:10.505
Why were you at home?

1:11:10.538 --> 1:11:11.506
We had the parent-teacher
conference today,

1:11:11.539 --> 1:11:12.607
and I had to talk

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:13.717
- to that woman by myself...
- Oh, jeez, it's like

1:11:13.741 --> 1:11:15.519
I'm supposed to keep track
of every little thing

1:11:15.543 --> 1:11:17.745
on your calendar! Hi, Charlie.

1:11:17.779 --> 1:11:18.913
What am I supposed to do?

1:11:18.946 --> 1:11:20.480
Am I supposed to read your mind!

1:11:20.515 --> 1:11:22.449
- We're going in here!
- Okay, let's go in there!

1:11:22.482 --> 1:11:23.350
Yes, you're supposed to watch
the calendar!

1:11:23.383 --> 1:11:24.819
Yeah, let's do this!

1:11:28.890 --> 1:11:31.893
In your opinion,

1:11:31.926 --> 1:11:37.031
what makes a character heroic?

1:11:37.064 --> 1:11:40.333
Who are the heroes in your life?

1:11:40.367 --> 1:11:42.937
Do you consider yourself
to be a hero?

1:11:44.639 --> 1:11:47.708
What does it mean
to be a dreamer?

1:11:47.742 --> 1:11:50.477
What does it mean to be a doer?

1:11:50.511 --> 1:11:51.979
Which are you?

1:11:54.949 --> 1:11:59.352
A protagonist is
someone that we root for.

1:11:59.386 --> 1:12:02.690
"Pro" equals "for, in favor of."

1:12:02.723 --> 1:12:06.828
An antagonist is
the protagonist's enemy.

1:12:06.861 --> 1:12:09.697
"Anti" equals
"against, opposed to."

1:12:09.730 --> 1:12:11.132
- Oh! Oh!
- Mm-hm?

1:12:11.165 --> 1:12:14.769
Why isn't it "anti-agonist?"

1:12:14.802 --> 1:12:17.738
What a good question, Astrida!

1:12:17.772 --> 1:12:21.509
I can't say
I know the answer to that.

1:12:21.542 --> 1:12:22.877
Oh well.

1:12:22.910 --> 1:12:25.079
You children will learn
that the English language

1:12:25.112 --> 1:12:27.849
is full of idiosyncrasies.

1:12:27.882 --> 1:12:31.052
But what's our story
supposed to be about?

1:12:31.085 --> 1:12:36.123
Well, one thing
that we can all agree on

1:12:36.157 --> 1:12:39.392
is that good stories feature

1:12:39.426 --> 1:12:42.697
an extraordinary protagonist.

1:12:42.730 --> 1:12:44.599
So begin there.

1:12:52.907 --> 1:12:55.776
What do you do?

1:12:55.810 --> 1:12:57.545
Huh?

1:12:57.578 --> 1:12:58.913
That class.

1:12:58.946 --> 1:13:04.819
What you do in that class
when you go with Astrida?

1:13:04.852 --> 1:13:08.823
Oh, you mean Language Arts.

1:13:08.856 --> 1:13:10.457
Yes.

1:13:10.490 --> 1:13:15.495
That class you go
with the other smart kids.

1:13:15.529 --> 1:13:18.132
I'm not smart.

1:13:18.165 --> 1:13:21.434
Yes, you are smart, Charlie.

1:13:21.468 --> 1:13:24.505
You best at loops.

1:13:24.538 --> 1:13:27.608
Better than Brax the Ax.

1:13:30.244 --> 1:13:32.680
We're supposed to write a story.

1:13:32.713 --> 1:13:35.482
Story about what?

1:13:35.516 --> 1:13:37.118
I don't know.

1:13:37.151 --> 1:13:39.486
That's the problem.

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:40.988
A hero.

1:13:41.022 --> 1:13:43.524
Somebody that you root for.

1:13:43.557 --> 1:13:45.092
Hmm.

1:13:46.193 --> 1:13:48.596
I can't think of anything
good to write about.

1:13:48.629 --> 1:13:52.767
You'll think of something good
to write about your story.

1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:55.036
You'll think of hero.

1:13:55.069 --> 1:13:58.539
I root for you.

1:14:03.744 --> 1:14:04.679
How many people?

1:14:04.712 --> 1:14:06.223
- Did you tell the neighbors?
- I told Peggy.

1:14:06.247 --> 1:14:07.858
She saw all of the bottles
in the trash can!

1:14:07.882 --> 1:14:09.050
What was I supposed to do?

1:14:09.083 --> 1:14:10.651
"In Arizona,
Mrs. Sherri Finkbine

1:14:10.685 --> 1:14:11.995
heard that her unborn child
would be cheated

1:14:12.019 --> 1:14:14.956
of its arms and legs.

1:14:14.989 --> 1:14:16.624
Thalidomide.

1:14:16.657 --> 1:14:17.825
Deformity.

1:14:17.858 --> 1:14:19.961
Phocomelia.

1:14:19.994 --> 1:14:21.796
Seal limbs.

1:14:21.829 --> 1:14:23.898
Stumps.

1:14:23.931 --> 1:14:25.575
Some people think
that the babies should be

1:14:25.599 --> 1:14:26.634
"mercifully killed."

1:14:26.667 --> 1:14:27.802
Ow!

1:14:27.835 --> 1:14:28.569
You keep your damn mouth shut!

1:14:28.602 --> 1:14:30.638
Keep your goddamn hands
off of me!

1:14:30.671 --> 1:14:31.806
Yeah! Huh?

1:14:31.839 --> 1:14:32.840
You like that?

1:14:32.873 --> 1:14:36.110
"Things like fingers
extrude from odd places."

1:14:36.143 --> 1:14:38.646
I promise I won't tell anybody!
I'm sorry.

1:14:38.679 --> 1:14:39.447
All right, all right, all right.

1:14:39.479 --> 1:14:41.215
Just shut up. Just... all right.

1:14:53.861 --> 1:14:55.296
All right, Buddy.

1:14:55.329 --> 1:14:56.998
Here you go.

1:14:57.031 --> 1:14:58.933
Scramble and toast.

1:14:58.966 --> 1:15:00.968
Not touching.

1:15:06.607 --> 1:15:08.209
Do you want some coffee?

1:15:10.144 --> 1:15:12.947
Your mom's, uh, not feeling well
this morning.

1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:14.081
Got a touch of the flu,

1:15:14.115 --> 1:15:16.117
so it's just going to be
you and me at Mass, okay?

1:15:16.150 --> 1:15:17.985
Okay.

1:15:20.354 --> 1:15:22.023
There's a Rainiers game
tomorrow.

1:15:22.056 --> 1:15:24.291
You want to go?

1:15:24.325 --> 1:15:26.560
Yeah? All right.

1:15:26.594 --> 1:15:29.163
Get something on
the third-base line, maybe?

1:15:29.196 --> 1:15:31.632
- Yeah, sure.
- Good seats.

1:15:38.105 --> 1:15:39.249
Can you find his comforter,
Charles?

1:15:39.273 --> 1:15:42.777
I think it's in that box.

1:15:42.810 --> 1:15:44.779
How's that girl's project
coming along?

1:15:44.812 --> 1:15:47.882
Which girl?

1:15:47.915 --> 1:15:49.283
The one with the photos.

1:15:49.316 --> 1:15:51.285
Haven't you seen the pictures?

1:15:51.318 --> 1:15:53.154
Yes, some.

1:15:53.187 --> 1:15:57.958
She's actually showing them
at the fundraiser in May.

1:15:57.992 --> 1:15:59.369
They're writing an article
about her or something

1:15:59.393 --> 1:16:01.262
- in the Times.
- Oh wow.

1:16:04.298 --> 1:16:07.334
You could come if you want.

1:16:07.368 --> 1:16:09.203
To the fundraiser.

1:16:11.939 --> 1:16:13.641
You used to like them.

1:16:13.674 --> 1:16:15.242
We'll see.

1:16:16.210 --> 1:16:17.244
I brought wine.

1:16:17.278 --> 1:16:18.946
- You want a glass?
- Yes.

1:16:18.979 --> 1:16:20.748
Yes.

1:16:23.217 --> 1:16:25.286
- It's a nice room.
- Oh, Charles.

1:16:25.319 --> 1:16:27.655
Will we ever be able to die?

1:16:27.688 --> 1:16:30.024
Excuse me?

1:16:30.057 --> 1:16:31.258
I just mean, will we...

1:16:31.292 --> 1:16:35.029
will we ever be able to let go
as long as he's like this?

1:16:37.731 --> 1:16:38.731
Of course not.

1:16:40.067 --> 1:16:45.706
Well... in that case...

1:16:47.108 --> 1:16:49.844
immortality it is.

1:16:51.946 --> 1:16:55.850
You know, what this place needs
is an endowment or something.

1:16:55.883 --> 1:16:59.420
So that they'll be okay
if something happened to us.

1:16:59.453 --> 1:17:00.454
Cheers.

1:17:00.488 --> 1:17:02.690
Maybe I'll call
the Northwest Autism Foundation

1:17:02.723 --> 1:17:04.358
and ask about it.

1:17:04.391 --> 1:17:07.094
That's not a bad idea.

1:17:23.210 --> 1:17:26.013
You still wear this?

1:17:26.046 --> 1:17:27.381
Of course I do.

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:36.056
I forget sometimes
how sentimental you are.

1:17:47.401 --> 1:17:49.103
Cody, Cody.

1:17:49.136 --> 1:17:51.338
Cody, come here, come here.

1:17:51.372 --> 1:17:52.306
Cody.

1:17:52.339 --> 1:17:53.874
- Cody.
- Honey.

1:17:53.908 --> 1:17:55.743
Honey, come here.
Come here, baby.

1:17:55.776 --> 1:17:56.744
Come here.

1:17:56.777 --> 1:17:58.045
Look at the TV.

1:17:58.078 --> 1:17:59.222
Come here, son. Come here, baby.

1:17:59.246 --> 1:18:00.181
Look at this TV screen.

1:18:00.214 --> 1:18:04.185
Come here, honey.
Cody, grab Mommy's hand.

1:18:04.218 --> 1:18:05.886
See?

1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:07.430
You're going to see a picture
of your baby brother

1:18:07.454 --> 1:18:09.924
or baby sister.

1:18:09.957 --> 1:18:11.959
Would you like to know the sex?

1:18:11.992 --> 1:18:13.360
- Yes.
- No.

1:18:14.795 --> 1:18:15.996
Yes, we would.

1:18:21.869 --> 1:18:24.038
The baby's floating.

1:18:24.071 --> 1:18:27.174
And that's just like you
when you're swimming.

1:18:27.208 --> 1:18:29.310
- And you know what else?
- Mm?

1:18:29.343 --> 1:18:31.946
When the baby comes out,

1:18:31.979 --> 1:18:36.016
you and the baby are going
to get to go swimming together.

1:18:36.050 --> 1:18:38.520
Isn't that great?

1:18:38.553 --> 1:18:41.455
Let's get a nice picture
for you.

1:18:42.489 --> 1:18:44.201
Everything looks
totally normal, by the way.

1:18:44.225 --> 1:18:45.893
No cause for worry.

1:18:45.926 --> 1:18:47.895
Oh, I'm not... oh!

1:18:47.928 --> 1:18:50.431
Is it okay if our son
touches the screen?

1:18:57.204 --> 1:18:59.840
Gaa...

1:18:59.873 --> 1:19:03.310
gaa...

1:19:09.283 --> 1:19:12.920
We are gonna miss you so much.

1:19:12.953 --> 1:19:14.288
It's okay.

1:19:14.321 --> 1:19:17.791
We understand
that you can't stay with us.

1:19:20.995 --> 1:19:23.297
Maybe we'll see you again.

1:19:23.330 --> 1:19:25.533
No one really knows
how that works.

1:20:55.289 --> 1:20:57.424
Gaa...

1:20:57.458 --> 1:20:59.594
Gaa.

1:21:20.214 --> 1:21:21.649
Hey.

1:21:21.683 --> 1:21:23.183
You're home.

1:21:24.519 --> 1:21:27.388
You sick?

1:21:27.421 --> 1:21:30.525
- No.
- What's wrong?

1:21:30.558 --> 1:21:33.293
Oh...

1:21:33.327 --> 1:21:37.131
I'm just a little... tired.

1:21:37.164 --> 1:21:38.465
I'll start dinner.

1:21:38.499 --> 1:21:41.669
It's okay. You don't have
to fix me anything.

1:21:41.703 --> 1:21:44.204
I'm not hungry.

1:21:44.238 --> 1:21:46.508
What's with all the boxes?

1:21:48.175 --> 1:21:49.076
Those are just some things

1:21:49.109 --> 1:21:52.179
I was going to take
to the thrift store.

1:21:52.212 --> 1:21:55.048
I meant to drive them over
this afternoon.

1:21:56.651 --> 1:21:58.452
What?

1:21:58.485 --> 1:22:00.254
No.

1:22:04.124 --> 1:22:06.493
Why would you give this away?

1:22:08.095 --> 1:22:10.632
We're not having
any more babies.

1:22:10.665 --> 1:22:13.167
Well, we haven't
talked about that.

1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:15.402
You... you don't know that.

1:22:15.436 --> 1:22:18.405
No, we're not going
to talk about it, Charles.

1:22:21.108 --> 1:22:22.510
Where's the rest of it?

1:22:26.681 --> 1:22:28.115
Okay.

1:22:47.501 --> 1:22:48.969
You didn't.

1:22:51.773 --> 1:22:56.210
Alison, tell me that you didn't.

1:22:56.243 --> 1:22:57.645
No more babies.

1:23:01.683 --> 1:23:03.718
I got a tubal ligation.

1:23:06.220 --> 1:23:08.288
No, no.

1:23:11.425 --> 1:23:13.595
No.

1:23:13.628 --> 1:23:17.699
Because Alison, that, surely,

1:23:17.732 --> 1:23:20.200
you would've spoken to me about,
right?

1:24:14.421 --> 1:24:16.123
Do you regret it?

1:24:16.156 --> 1:24:19.359
Regret what?

1:24:19.393 --> 1:24:22.362
Our marriage.

1:24:22.396 --> 1:24:24.164
Our life together.

1:24:29.369 --> 1:24:31.573
Charles, how can you ask that?

1:24:31.606 --> 1:24:33.608
Well, it hasn't been easy.

1:24:33.641 --> 1:24:38.613
I don't think you can regret
anything once you have a child.

1:24:38.646 --> 1:24:40.882
How do you mean?

1:24:40.915 --> 1:24:43.283
I mean, everything you've done
up until this moment.

1:24:43.317 --> 1:24:45.485
Every detour.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:47.789
Every choice.

1:24:49.524 --> 1:24:52.594
It all led to them.

1:24:52.627 --> 1:25:00.627
So to regret anything, to wish
for any of it changed...

1:25:00.702 --> 1:25:03.470
would mean a different
outcome, wouldn't it?

1:25:12.914 --> 1:25:14.549
I need to go.

1:25:14.582 --> 1:25:15.583
I'm sorry.

1:25:15.617 --> 1:25:17.852
- No, it's fine.
- It's good. It's fine.

1:25:17.885 --> 1:25:20.187
Umm... thank you, though.

1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:23.591
And I'll take a rain check
on that wine.

1:25:23.625 --> 1:25:25.292
Take care.

1:25:43.745 --> 1:25:45.345
I win!

1:25:45.379 --> 1:25:46.648
Look, Charlie.

1:25:46.681 --> 1:25:48.950
I did it again.

1:25:48.983 --> 1:25:52.620
- Atta boy, me.
- I see, Dana.

1:25:54.656 --> 1:25:56.858
You try, Charlie.

1:25:56.891 --> 1:25:58.660
No, that's okay.

1:25:58.693 --> 1:25:59.527
You win.

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:02.797
I'm going to work on this
for now.

1:26:02.830 --> 1:26:03.965
What's this?

1:26:03.998 --> 1:26:05.533
Show.

1:26:05.566 --> 1:26:08.502
You know, maybe later, um...

1:26:08.536 --> 1:26:10.571
Here, you can have this back.

1:26:10.605 --> 1:26:13.340
I'm gonna show you
when I'm done.

1:26:13.373 --> 1:26:14.542
Okay.

1:26:14.575 --> 1:26:17.344
You show me when you done.

1:26:20.682 --> 1:26:21.949
Faggot.

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:24.284
Queer.

1:26:24.317 --> 1:26:25.520
Retards.

1:26:31.258 --> 1:26:33.661
Huh, hm.

1:27:00.822 --> 1:27:03.691
Up and down and around, again.

1:27:03.725 --> 1:27:06.728
Up and down and around, again.

1:27:06.761 --> 1:27:10.330
Up and down and around, again.

1:27:10.363 --> 1:27:11.666
Hey, spaz.

1:27:11.699 --> 1:27:13.400
Come make Palmer loops with us.

1:27:13.433 --> 1:27:15.002
Hi, Charlie.

1:27:15.036 --> 1:27:16.838
Dana, come out of there now!

1:27:16.871 --> 1:27:19.907
No, Charlie, it's fun.

1:27:19.941 --> 1:27:22.677
Up and down and around, again.

1:27:22.710 --> 1:27:25.513
Up and down and around, again.

1:27:30.017 --> 1:27:31.753
Yes.

1:27:31.786 --> 1:27:34.555
Thank you for calling.

1:27:34.589 --> 1:27:35.623
Goodbye.

1:27:37.592 --> 1:27:40.928
So, what is this story about?

1:27:40.962 --> 1:27:43.002
The one that you wrote
for your Language Arts class.

1:27:45.566 --> 1:27:46.834
That was Mrs. Braxton.

1:27:46.868 --> 1:27:48.679
She wants to enter it
into some kind of contest

1:27:48.703 --> 1:27:50.671
and needs my permission.

1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:54.374
What kind of contest?

1:27:54.407 --> 1:27:57.845
Something that
the Seattle Times is sponsoring.

1:27:57.879 --> 1:27:59.981
You didn't know about it?

1:28:06.821 --> 1:28:08.956
So, what's it about?

1:28:08.990 --> 1:28:11.692
Your story?

1:28:11.726 --> 1:28:16.597
Just a kid who goes on a trip.

1:28:16.631 --> 1:28:19.499
That's it, really.

1:28:19.534 --> 1:28:23.336
Well, can you tell me
the title at least?

1:28:23.370 --> 1:28:26.707
"Flipper Boy,"
by Charles Marlow.

1:28:31.546 --> 1:28:34.949
Once upon a time,
in a small town

1:28:34.982 --> 1:28:38.085
in the land of sky blue waters,

1:28:38.119 --> 1:28:42.389
a boy was born
to a husband and wife.

1:28:42.422 --> 1:28:45.793
They named him Kennedy.

1:28:45.827 --> 1:28:49.664
At first, Kennedy was like
every other boy in the town.

1:28:49.697 --> 1:28:53.400
He liked eating Hostess CupCakes
and watching TV

1:28:53.433 --> 1:28:56.037
and swimming
and reading comic books.

1:28:56.070 --> 1:29:00.775
He had no brothers or sisters,
or even any pets.

1:29:00.808 --> 1:29:03.110
One night,
Kennedy heard his parents

1:29:03.144 --> 1:29:08.415
outside his bedroom door
arguing about pets.

1:29:08.448 --> 1:29:11.752
His mom said,
"It would mean so much to him."

1:29:11.786 --> 1:29:15.923
And his dad said, "I don't want
a filthy animal in the house.

1:29:15.957 --> 1:29:19.126
Who do you think is going
to take care of it?"

1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:25.099
And that was when Kennedy felt
something funny about his toes.

1:29:25.132 --> 1:29:28.102
He fell asleep
and forgot about it.

1:29:28.135 --> 1:29:29.570
But in the morning,

1:29:29.604 --> 1:29:31.572
when he went
to put on his sandals,

1:29:31.606 --> 1:29:36.110
he saw that his little toes
had shrunk tiny.

1:29:36.143 --> 1:29:39.847
Every night his parents fought
or told a lie,

1:29:39.881 --> 1:29:45.653
some part of Kennedy's body
got smaller or deformed.

1:29:45.686 --> 1:29:49.724
But one day, when his mother,
who had been crying,

1:29:49.757 --> 1:29:52.159
put his tuna sandwich down
in front of him,

1:29:52.193 --> 1:29:55.897
she looked into his face
and screamed.

1:29:55.930 --> 1:29:58.799
"Mom, what is it?"
Kennedy asked.

1:29:58.833 --> 1:30:01.936
But she didn't answer,
because she had fainted.

1:30:04.872 --> 1:30:08.175
But when their sight
was restored,

1:30:08.209 --> 1:30:11.979
and they saw the gold crucifix
around his neck,

1:30:12.013 --> 1:30:14.882
they recognized Kennedy.

1:30:14.916 --> 1:30:17.518
Not as the crippled
wheelchair doctor

1:30:17.551 --> 1:30:19.086
that had saved them,

1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:22.723
but as their long lost son.

1:30:22.757 --> 1:30:25.092
They fell weeping
into one another's arms

1:30:25.126 --> 1:30:28.562
and lived happily ever after.

1:30:28.596 --> 1:30:29.730
The end.

1:30:33.534 --> 1:30:35.636
Yay, Charlie!

1:30:35.670 --> 1:30:37.905
Yay, yay!

1:30:37.939 --> 1:30:40.473
Yay, Charlie!

1:30:46.547 --> 1:30:47.815
Yay.

1:30:47.848 --> 1:30:50.084
I like that story.

1:31:20.147 --> 1:31:21.716
Hi, Charlie.

1:31:21.749 --> 1:31:23.617
We're playing new game.

1:31:23.651 --> 1:31:25.686
We're playing
Cowboys and Indians.

1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.622
I thought we were playing
Damsel in this Dress.

1:31:28.656 --> 1:31:30.091
No.

1:31:30.124 --> 1:31:32.560
You really like making
those Palmer loops, don't you?

1:31:32.593 --> 1:31:33.561
Huh.

1:31:33.594 --> 1:31:35.096
You know what?

1:31:35.129 --> 1:31:36.297
Now that Charlie's here,

1:31:36.330 --> 1:31:39.066
I think we should do
some Palmer practice!

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:41.702
But wait,
it's a special challenge.

1:31:41.736 --> 1:31:43.537
You have to make Palmer loops

1:31:43.571 --> 1:31:46.240
without holding the pencil
in your hands.

1:31:46.273 --> 1:31:47.975
How do we do that?

1:31:48.009 --> 1:31:51.045
How we make loops without hands?

1:31:51.078 --> 1:31:56.017
Well, you could put the pencil
in your ear like this.

1:31:56.050 --> 1:31:57.852
You funny, Mitchell.

1:31:57.885 --> 1:32:00.788
Or you could put it
in your mouth.

1:32:00.821 --> 1:32:02.823
Or in your nose.

1:32:02.857 --> 1:32:04.792
Or you could do it another way.

1:32:04.825 --> 1:32:06.160
- What way?
- Stop!

1:32:06.193 --> 1:32:08.863
But he wants to know,
don't you, Dana?

1:32:08.896 --> 1:32:10.765
I do, I do.

1:32:10.798 --> 1:32:12.733
Do you know, Charlie?

1:32:12.767 --> 1:32:15.569
Do you know
where a pencil can go,

1:32:15.603 --> 1:32:19.807
besides your ear
or your nose or your mouth?

1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:21.709
- Stop!
- Maybe you want to show him.

1:32:24.311 --> 1:32:26.947
- Gross!
- Charlie sick.

1:32:26.981 --> 1:32:31.886
So, which one of you is gonna do
the special challenge?

1:32:31.919 --> 1:32:34.088
Me. I make loops.

1:32:34.121 --> 1:32:36.323
- Charlie sick.
- Okay, Dana.

1:32:36.357 --> 1:32:37.958
Atta boy.

1:32:37.992 --> 1:32:39.093
Dana.

1:32:41.162 --> 1:32:43.798
Get on your knees.

1:32:43.831 --> 1:32:45.366
Now bend over.

1:32:45.399 --> 1:32:46.801
That's right.

1:32:46.834 --> 1:32:47.835
Just like a dog.

1:32:47.868 --> 1:32:49.170
Shit, Mitch.

1:32:49.203 --> 1:32:50.671
Are you sure?

1:32:50.704 --> 1:32:51.748
You sure you should do that?

1:32:51.772 --> 1:32:53.307
Don't be such a faggot.

1:32:53.340 --> 1:32:55.176
Didn't your mommy ever
take your temperature

1:32:55.209 --> 1:32:57.144
when you were
a little bitty baby?

1:32:57.178 --> 1:32:58.646
Get over here and help me.

1:32:58.679 --> 1:32:59.914
Spread his butt cheeks.

1:33:06.787 --> 1:33:08.189
What are you waiting for?

1:33:08.222 --> 1:33:09.990
Get to work, retard.

1:33:10.024 --> 1:33:11.892
- How?
- You tell him, Charlie.

1:33:11.926 --> 1:33:12.993
You're the teacher.

1:33:13.027 --> 1:33:13.928
What?

1:33:13.961 --> 1:33:16.964
Or maybe you want to do
the challenge, too.

1:33:16.997 --> 1:33:18.699
Brad, get another pencil.

1:33:18.732 --> 1:33:20.367
- No!
- Tell him.

1:33:20.401 --> 1:33:22.002
If you tell him, I'll untie you.

1:33:22.036 --> 1:33:24.004
- Charlie, how?
- Tell him faggot,

1:33:24.038 --> 1:33:26.006
or you're next!

1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:28.709
Dana, make loops.

1:33:30.444 --> 1:33:32.379
You said you were gonna
untie me!

1:33:32.413 --> 1:33:33.814
Hey!

1:33:33.848 --> 1:33:36.117
Someone's coming,
you better quit that!

1:33:36.150 --> 1:33:38.185
You need to get out of there
right now!

1:33:38.219 --> 1:33:39.954
- Shit!
- Untie them.

1:33:39.987 --> 1:33:40.855
- Shit!
- Move.

1:33:40.888 --> 1:33:42.256
Shit.

1:34:02.276 --> 1:34:03.244
Charlie.

1:34:03.277 --> 1:34:05.112
Charlie Marlow.

1:34:10.284 --> 1:34:12.720
Oh, my God, he's burning up.

1:34:25.166 --> 1:34:26.767
Hello?

1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:28.869
Yes, this is Mrs. Marlow.

1:34:31.105 --> 1:34:32.339
Yes?

1:34:36.110 --> 1:34:37.912
Are you saying
that Charles was involved?

1:34:41.015 --> 1:34:42.349
I see.

1:34:42.383 --> 1:34:44.118
Thank you for calling.

1:34:51.258 --> 1:34:52.960
That was your principal.

1:34:52.993 --> 1:34:55.429
She said you were in some kind
of fight during Field Day.

1:34:55.462 --> 1:34:56.830
Why didn't you say anything?

1:34:59.934 --> 1:35:01.135
What happened, Charles?

1:35:04.471 --> 1:35:08.309
One of your classmates,
that Dana fellow,

1:35:08.342 --> 1:35:10.344
was very seriously injured.

1:35:10.377 --> 1:35:12.246
He's in the hospital
in intensive care.

1:35:12.279 --> 1:35:13.914
They said that he even might...

1:35:19.453 --> 1:35:21.222
Were you involved
in any of this?

1:35:22.456 --> 1:35:24.225
No.

1:35:24.258 --> 1:35:26.093
Not exactly.

1:35:26.126 --> 1:35:28.395
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

1:35:28.429 --> 1:35:29.964
Some boys, they...

1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.869
did something to Dana.

1:35:35.903 --> 1:35:37.905
Did you see what they did?

1:35:37.938 --> 1:35:38.939
Did you try to stop them?

1:35:40.575 --> 1:35:41.575
Charles!

1:35:48.182 --> 1:35:49.483
That's good.

1:35:50.951 --> 1:35:52.520
That's good.

1:35:52.554 --> 1:35:54.064
You might have been
very seriously injured

1:35:54.088 --> 1:35:55.923
if you had tried to intervene.

1:35:57.091 --> 1:35:59.159
I'll make you another snack.

1:36:11.038 --> 1:36:12.840
Oh.

1:36:12.873 --> 1:36:14.308
Charles.

1:36:19.847 --> 1:36:23.317
I'm so glad I ran into you.

1:36:23.350 --> 1:36:27.154
Dana is at Children's Hospital,

1:36:27.187 --> 1:36:30.357
and I'm sure he'd love
to see you before...

1:36:34.495 --> 1:36:36.964
I couldn't protect him, Charles.

1:36:40.034 --> 1:36:44.238
But you have been
such a wonderful friend.

1:36:50.244 --> 1:36:52.614
Goodbye, Charles.

1:37:51.673 --> 1:37:53.374
Please, God.

1:37:55.242 --> 1:37:59.146
Don't let Dana McGucken die.

1:37:59.179 --> 1:38:03.183
Please, God,
don't let Dana McGucken die.

1:38:03.217 --> 1:38:05.085
Please, please, God,

1:38:05.119 --> 1:38:09.423
just don't let
Dana McGucken die.

1:38:21.335 --> 1:38:23.070
Please?

1:39:58.198 --> 1:40:02.069
Charles, I hope this letter
finds you well.

1:40:02.102 --> 1:40:03.571
I was delighted
to read in the paper

1:40:03.605 --> 1:40:06.340
that you are a famous teacher.

1:40:06.373 --> 1:40:09.476
I'm not sure if you will
remember my son, Dana.

1:40:09.511 --> 1:40:12.179
He was in
your fourth grade class.

1:40:12.212 --> 1:40:15.082
I have thought of you often
over the years.

1:40:15.115 --> 1:40:18.318
I remember well
how kind you were with Dana.

1:40:18.352 --> 1:40:20.287
I'm sure your life is very full,

1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:23.156
but if you would ever
care to meet,

1:40:23.190 --> 1:40:25.693
I would be delighted
to offer you some coffee or tea

1:40:25.727 --> 1:40:28.195
at your earliest convenience.

1:40:28.228 --> 1:40:31.298
I wish you and yours
all the very best.

1:40:31.331 --> 1:40:34.702
Sincerely yours,
Sylvie McGucken.

1:40:34.736 --> 1:40:36.503
Hello, Charles.

1:40:36.538 --> 1:40:38.740
Please come in.

1:40:38.773 --> 1:40:40.240
Welcome.

1:40:46.213 --> 1:40:47.849
Do you take milk?

1:40:47.882 --> 1:40:49.517
No, thank you.

1:40:51.686 --> 1:40:54.488
That was such a nice article
about you in the paper.

1:40:54.522 --> 1:40:55.455
It was.

1:40:55.489 --> 1:40:57.592
That student in the article
in particular

1:40:57.625 --> 1:40:59.794
is quite special.

1:40:59.827 --> 1:41:02.296
I'm sure they look up to you.

1:41:02.329 --> 1:41:03.329
Oh.

1:41:09.871 --> 1:41:13.173
I don't like to talk about him
with everyone,

1:41:13.206 --> 1:41:15.142
so I keep these out of sight.

1:41:15.175 --> 1:41:18.278
But please, have a look.

1:41:52.379 --> 1:41:54.816
Charles, are you all right?

1:41:54.849 --> 1:41:56.818
This picture.

1:41:56.851 --> 1:41:59.587
- Is this...
- Yes!

1:41:59.621 --> 1:42:01.723
That's Dana.

1:42:01.756 --> 1:42:05.727
He must be, oh, maybe 17 there.

1:42:08.428 --> 1:42:09.631
Charles?

1:42:13.333 --> 1:42:15.369
I thought... I thought that...

1:42:16.503 --> 1:42:18.238
You thought he died?

1:42:19.907 --> 1:42:21.174
Oh.

1:42:22.476 --> 1:42:24.177
No.

1:42:24.211 --> 1:42:26.714
Dana recovered
from those injuries.

1:42:26.748 --> 1:42:29.316
I thought you knew.

1:42:29.349 --> 1:42:33.186
I called your mother to tell her
in case you were worried.

1:42:33.220 --> 1:42:34.589
You told my mother?

1:42:34.622 --> 1:42:36.958
- Well, yes, I...
- You told my mother

1:42:36.991 --> 1:42:38.458
that Dana was all right?

1:42:40.695 --> 1:42:41.896
Yes.

1:42:43.731 --> 1:42:47.234
I'm really so very sorry
that you didn't know.

1:42:48.736 --> 1:42:54.207
I kept Dana at home for a while
after what happened.

1:42:56.844 --> 1:43:01.415
But then, a school opened up
on Shaw Island.

1:43:01.448 --> 1:43:03.350
A school for special children,

1:43:03.383 --> 1:43:06.386
run by an order
of Benedictine nuns.

1:43:06.420 --> 1:43:09.524
Dana lived there
until he was 18 years old.

1:43:09.557 --> 1:43:12.325
And those were
very good years for him.

1:43:13.628 --> 1:43:17.532
Here's a picture of him there.

1:43:21.769 --> 1:43:25.472
And then he moved
back in with me.

1:43:25.505 --> 1:43:27.608
If you don't mind my asking...

1:43:27.642 --> 1:43:29.844
He died at home.

1:43:29.877 --> 1:43:32.747
He was 27 years old.

1:43:32.780 --> 1:43:37.417
He just... fell asleep.

1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:40.555
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh.

1:43:42.056 --> 1:43:46.027
As brief as Dana's life was,

1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:48.495
it was very rich.

1:43:48.529 --> 1:43:50.464
He was loved.

1:43:50.497 --> 1:43:52.600
He had friends.

1:43:52.633 --> 1:43:55.368
And as to
the fourth grade incident,

1:43:55.402 --> 1:43:58.840
it didn't change him
in the least.

1:43:58.873 --> 1:44:03.878
But then, Dana had a gift for...

1:44:05.378 --> 1:44:07.247
for happiness, you know?

1:44:08.683 --> 1:44:11.919
He was kind of an angel,
I think.

1:44:11.953 --> 1:44:13.855
At least to me.

1:44:18.059 --> 1:44:21.529
Now I've gone on and on
about my family.

1:44:21.562 --> 1:44:24.866
How rude of me
not to ask about yours.

1:44:24.899 --> 1:44:26.667
Did you marry?

1:44:28.002 --> 1:44:30.303
Um, yes, I did.

1:44:30.337 --> 1:44:31.572
Children?

1:44:44.417 --> 1:44:46.721
These are Dana's letters to me

1:44:46.754 --> 1:44:49.289
from his time on Shaw Island.

1:44:55.428 --> 1:44:56.496
Oh.

1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:00.101
He wrote these?

1:45:00.134 --> 1:45:01.969
- Every one.
- No.

1:45:06.140 --> 1:45:08.475
These are yours to keep.

1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:15.817
Mrs. McGucken, thank you,
but no, I couldn't.

1:45:15.850 --> 1:45:17.084
Please don't worry.

1:45:17.118 --> 1:45:20.721
Dana wrote lots of letters.

1:45:20.755 --> 1:45:25.726
I just wanted you to know
that you taught him well.

1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:29.831
He made those wonderful loops
right up until the day he died.

1:45:34.434 --> 1:45:36.469
- Your mother.
- Mhm.

1:45:36.503 --> 1:45:39.574
Is she still alive?

1:45:39.607 --> 1:45:42.677
No, she... no,
she passed a long time ago.

1:45:46.479 --> 1:45:50.117
Don't be too hard on the dead,
Charles.

1:45:50.151 --> 1:45:52.887
It's not easy for them
to say they're sorry

1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:54.655
or ask for forgiveness.

1:45:57.592 --> 1:45:59.727
Although I do believe they try.

1:46:09.770 --> 1:46:11.438
- Romy.
- Hi, Mr. Marlow.

1:46:11.471 --> 1:46:12.840
Congratulations.

1:46:12.874 --> 1:46:16.010
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1:46:16.043 --> 1:46:18.779
Have you met Sister Martha
and Sister Frances?

1:46:18.813 --> 1:46:20.815
No.

1:46:20.848 --> 1:46:22.617
Okay.

1:46:22.650 --> 1:46:24.785
This is my teacher, Mr. Marlow.

1:46:24.819 --> 1:46:26.187
- Ah.
- Oh, how do you do?

1:46:26.220 --> 1:46:27.555
Nice to meet you.

1:46:27.588 --> 1:46:29.657
Sister Frances, Martha?

1:46:29.690 --> 1:46:31.092
- Martha - Frances.

1:46:31.125 --> 1:46:32.760
Frances, Martha, okay.

1:46:32.793 --> 1:46:35.696
Mr. Marlow's son, Cody,
is the one who collaborated

1:46:35.730 --> 1:46:37.430
with Sister Giorgia
on the collages.

1:46:37.464 --> 1:46:39.432
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Oh.

1:46:39.466 --> 1:46:42.169
Lovely boy, beautiful work.

1:46:42.203 --> 1:46:45.438
We'd love to come meet him
sometime.

1:46:45.472 --> 1:46:47.108
I'm afraid we must be leaving.

1:46:47.141 --> 1:46:49.110
- We have to catch a ferry.
- Oh, yes.

1:46:49.143 --> 1:46:50.211
So good to meet you.

1:46:50.244 --> 1:46:52.546
- You too.
- It was such a pleasure.

1:46:53.681 --> 1:46:55.549
- Take care.
- God bless.

1:46:59.787 --> 1:47:01.622
I hope you don't mind.

1:47:01.656 --> 1:47:03.791
I was already taking
lots of photos of him,

1:47:03.824 --> 1:47:06.193
so it wasn't like I chose him
because he's your son.

1:47:06.227 --> 1:47:08.663
What do you mean, "chose him"?

1:47:08.696 --> 1:47:10.698
I only got to exhibit
five pictures,

1:47:10.731 --> 1:47:14.068
and the best were
of Sister Giorgia and Cody.

1:47:14.101 --> 1:47:16.871
Romy, um, this is...

1:47:16.904 --> 1:47:19.807
- Cody's mom.
- Yes.

1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:22.143
Excuse me, I should get back.

1:47:22.176 --> 1:47:23.644
See you on Monday, Mr. Marlow.

1:47:23.678 --> 1:47:26.881
- You bet.
- Nice to meet you, Mrs. Marlow.

1:47:26.914 --> 1:47:28.783
Oh, yes, well,

1:47:28.816 --> 1:47:31.752
it's very good
to meet you, too, Romy.

1:47:31.786 --> 1:47:32.954
- And good luck.
- Thank you.

1:47:32.987 --> 1:47:34.055
Yes.

1:47:36.023 --> 1:47:37.858
So, where's Bruce?

1:47:37.892 --> 1:47:39.927
California.

1:47:39.961 --> 1:47:41.028
Ah.

1:47:44.098 --> 1:47:45.232
Come on.

1:47:48.002 --> 1:47:49.704
Stop it.

1:47:52.006 --> 1:47:53.574
It's tempting.

1:48:02.717 --> 1:48:03.951
Oh.

1:48:08.089 --> 1:48:09.857
Wow.

1:48:12.793 --> 1:48:13.793
He made these?

1:48:16.197 --> 1:48:18.599
Can you believe it?

1:48:18.632 --> 1:48:19.499
How...

1:48:19.533 --> 1:48:22.203
Apparently
the 10-minute magazine rule

1:48:22.236 --> 1:48:25.006
- has been revoked.
- Right.

1:48:25.039 --> 1:48:26.574
And look at this one, look.

1:48:29.810 --> 1:48:33.080
And I guess the ramen noodle
grinding thing is kaput, too.

1:48:56.904 --> 1:49:01.275
"When memory fails,
cast the truth aside

1:49:01.308 --> 1:49:03.944
and then unbind the body."

1:49:07.848 --> 1:49:10.751
"You babblers may well
rule the earth,

1:49:10.785 --> 1:49:13.587
but Heaven is the kingdom
of the mute."

1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.230
I've been meaning to ask,
how's it going?

1:49:23.264 --> 1:49:24.665
How's what going?

1:49:24.698 --> 1:49:26.333
The conversion thing.

1:49:26.367 --> 1:49:27.935
The conversion thing?

1:49:27.968 --> 1:49:29.737
It's going fine.

1:49:29.770 --> 1:49:30.871
Good.

1:49:32.807 --> 1:49:34.708
I think about you sometimes.

1:49:34.742 --> 1:49:36.944
- Yeah?
- Oh, well, in class.

1:49:36.977 --> 1:49:39.213
You know, there are certain
aspects and ideas of it

1:49:39.246 --> 1:49:41.816
that I think you'd really like.

1:49:41.849 --> 1:49:42.950
Like what?

1:49:42.983 --> 1:49:45.853
Like not confining It.

1:49:45.886 --> 1:49:50.391
You know, Him, Her, whatever,
to a single name like "God."

1:49:50.424 --> 1:49:53.027
Does that make sense?

1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:54.795
It does.

1:49:54.829 --> 1:50:00.034
Maybe it's about finding
the right name for It.

1:50:01.735 --> 1:50:03.671
Like a name
that you can live with,

1:50:03.704 --> 1:50:07.842
maybe that's another way
of getting closer to belief.

1:50:07.875 --> 1:50:08.943
I don't know.

1:50:08.976 --> 1:50:10.644
What do I know?

1:50:10.678 --> 1:50:12.279
But you're a believer now?

1:50:16.050 --> 1:50:17.985
I don't know.

1:50:21.021 --> 1:50:24.091
But I know that it's okay
to seek comfort.

1:50:27.027 --> 1:50:28.662
To ask for help.

1:50:29.763 --> 1:50:31.065
Because even just saying that

1:50:31.098 --> 1:50:36.670
implies that Something
is listening.

1:50:36.704 --> 1:50:39.039
And sometimes
even just saying it

1:50:39.073 --> 1:50:41.175
is comfort in itself.

1:50:46.347 --> 1:50:48.916
Are you comforted?

1:50:48.949 --> 1:50:50.284
Yes.

1:50:57.057 --> 1:50:58.959
It was good to see you here.

1:50:58.993 --> 1:51:00.461
I'm glad I saw you.

1:51:00.494 --> 1:51:01.996
You too.

1:51:04.231 --> 1:51:07.268
There's another picture
over there you should look at.

1:51:07.301 --> 1:51:09.036
We'll talk soon?

1:51:09.069 --> 1:51:10.069
Okay.

1:51:24.218 --> 1:51:27.354
"Speak in tempests
of torn paper,

1:51:27.388 --> 1:51:32.393
I will answer
in flurries of loops."

1:51:56.784 --> 1:51:57.784
How much?

1:51:59.220 --> 1:52:00.354
Take 'em.

1:52:00.387 --> 1:52:01.722
What?

1:52:05.492 --> 1:52:06.927
How about a quarter each?

1:52:08.862 --> 1:52:10.264
Oh, okay, sure.

1:52:12.132 --> 1:52:14.835
Come back tomorrow,
everything's gonna be half off.

1:52:14.868 --> 1:52:15.836
Thanks, Buddy.

1:52:15.869 --> 1:52:16.869
Here you go.

1:52:36.156 --> 1:52:37.191
Okay.

1:52:37.224 --> 1:52:39.393
Thanks very much.

1:52:39.426 --> 1:52:41.328
Have a nice day.

1:52:41.362 --> 1:52:42.963
Uh, hey there!

1:52:42.997 --> 1:52:44.798
I was wondering.

1:52:44.832 --> 1:52:46.433
What size are these?

1:52:46.467 --> 1:52:48.035
Like a six and a half.

1:52:48.068 --> 1:52:50.137
How much?

1:52:50.170 --> 1:52:51.505
Seven.

1:52:51.539 --> 1:52:53.907
Just the boots only, right?

1:52:53.941 --> 1:52:55.809
No, the skis too.

1:52:57.512 --> 1:52:58.513
- Here.
- Seriously?

1:52:58.546 --> 1:53:01.415
Take this. Yeah.

1:53:01.448 --> 1:53:02.816
Here you go.

1:53:02.850 --> 1:53:04.418
You're welcome.

1:53:04.451 --> 1:53:09.290
I promise you, babe, you are
going to love Cross Country.

1:53:30.944 --> 1:53:32.846
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:53:35.082 --> 1:53:36.817
Hey, pal.

1:53:42.956 --> 1:53:44.391
Whatcha got?

1:53:44.425 --> 1:53:46.594
Oh, um...

1:53:49.363 --> 1:53:51.298
I hope you still like carnitas.

1:54:35.175 --> 1:54:37.512
- Hello!
- Hello!

1:54:37.545 --> 1:54:38.946
Hi.

1:54:38.979 --> 1:54:41.115
I hope you don't mind us
stopping by.

1:54:41.148 --> 1:54:43.250
- No, welcome.
- We came to the mainland

1:54:43.283 --> 1:54:44.952
to take Sister Giorgia to Mass,

1:54:44.985 --> 1:54:47.421
and we did so want
to meet your son, the artist.

1:54:47.454 --> 1:54:48.690
- Of course.
- Sister Giorgia,

1:54:48.723 --> 1:54:51.693
this is Charles Marlow.

1:54:51.726 --> 1:54:55.262
Oh, oh, oh.

1:54:55.295 --> 1:54:57.532
I am so sorry.

1:54:57.565 --> 1:54:59.299
Sister Giorgia!

1:54:59.333 --> 1:55:00.535
Come back here.

1:55:06.674 --> 1:55:11.278
This house is like a fairy tale.

1:55:11.311 --> 1:55:14.181
Oh, che cucina.

1:55:15.349 --> 1:55:17.351
Dear Heavenly Father,

1:55:17.384 --> 1:55:21.121
thank you for that
which I am about to receive.

1:55:21.155 --> 1:55:22.557
Amen.

1:55:26.694 --> 1:55:29.029
Let's not take those things
out of there.

1:55:30.130 --> 1:55:32.667
At last, my tools.

1:55:32.700 --> 1:55:34.401
Sister Giorgia,

1:55:34.435 --> 1:55:37.204
what are you doing
in nice Mr. Marlow's kitchen?

1:55:37.237 --> 1:55:38.673
Bread.

1:55:38.706 --> 1:55:41.442
We need bread.

1:55:41.475 --> 1:55:42.710
You've got so much mail

1:55:42.744 --> 1:55:45.345
that you haven't even
gone through yet.

1:55:45.379 --> 1:55:47.414
Do you have salt?

1:55:47.448 --> 1:55:48.982
You have salt, right?

1:55:49.016 --> 1:55:50.585
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, it's a miracle.

1:55:50.618 --> 1:55:52.754
I'm Jewish.

1:55:52.787 --> 1:55:54.321
Are you Jewish?

1:55:54.354 --> 1:55:56.423
So was Jesus.

1:55:56.457 --> 1:55:58.225
You don't want to stop

1:55:58.258 --> 1:56:00.494
till it feels
like a baby's butt.

1:56:00.528 --> 1:56:01.729
Okay!

1:56:01.763 --> 1:56:03.397
Okay, okay.

1:56:03.430 --> 1:56:05.132
Perfecto!

1:56:11.138 --> 1:56:14.174
The war is over,

1:56:14.208 --> 1:56:19.146
and the bakery is open.

1:56:19.179 --> 1:56:20.280
Come, let us eat.

1:56:22.517 --> 1:56:24.652
Bless us, O Lord,
and these Thy gifts

1:56:24.686 --> 1:56:27.755
which we are about to receive.

1:56:27.789 --> 1:56:29.356
No, no.

1:56:29.389 --> 1:56:30.758
No, no, no.

1:56:30.792 --> 1:56:33.360
We're missing
the most important part.

1:56:35.295 --> 1:56:37.464
Vino. Per favore.

1:56:39.701 --> 1:56:41.569
Per favore.

1:56:45.339 --> 1:56:48.075
The most important part.

1:56:48.108 --> 1:56:51.111
Mmm, smells good, huh?

1:56:54.081 --> 1:56:56.149
This is what Heaven smells like.

1:56:59.654 --> 1:57:01.121
Grazie.

1:57:01.154 --> 1:57:02.557
Not too much for her.

1:57:08.763 --> 1:57:10.163
Thank you.

1:57:12.266 --> 1:57:14.134
It smells good, huh?

1:57:33.521 --> 1:57:34.488
Evviva!

1:57:34.522 --> 1:57:36.089
- Evviva!
- Evviva!

1:57:36.123 --> 1:57:37.792
Evviva!

1:58:11.759 --> 1:58:14.261
That's my best friend.

1:58:15.362 --> 1:58:17.665
Dana McGucken.

1:58:17.699 --> 1:58:19.567
When we were young.

1:58:22.804 --> 1:58:27.508
I knew there was something
special about you, Signore.

1:58:27.542 --> 1:58:30.578
I knew it when I first saw you,

1:58:30.612 --> 1:58:32.714
and this house.

1:58:32.747 --> 1:58:35.282
And now here is the proof.

1:58:35.315 --> 1:58:39.520
You and our sweet Dana.

1:58:40.855 --> 1:58:43.925
He was pure blessing

1:58:43.958 --> 1:58:46.861
while he was in our school
on the island.

1:58:46.894 --> 1:58:49.296
A joy.

1:58:49.329 --> 1:58:52.165
We remember him, always.

1:58:53.868 --> 1:58:55.637
And you, Signore.

1:58:56.971 --> 1:58:59.841
You were his hero.

1:58:59.874 --> 1:59:02.409
His teacher.

1:59:02.442 --> 1:59:04.478
His friend.

1:59:11.251 --> 1:59:14.287
He roots for you,
Charlie Marlow.

1:59:24.699 --> 1:59:26.500
Addio, bello.

1:59:26.534 --> 1:59:28.569
Ciao.

1:59:46.587 --> 1:59:48.321
Hey, pal, you ready to go?

2:00:03.336 --> 2:00:05.807
Come on, Cody.

2:00:05.840 --> 2:00:09.977
Dad's tired and Mom's gotta
get you home, okay?

2:00:15.315 --> 2:00:16.651
Please, Cody.

2:00:16.684 --> 2:00:18.318
Ah.

2:00:21.354 --> 2:00:22.924
What is it?
