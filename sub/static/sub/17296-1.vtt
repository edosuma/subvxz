00:23.719 --> 00:26.287
Hey, guys! Y'all ready
to bait some hooks?

00:26.722 --> 00:30.073
- Fishing!
- What an appropriate activity for the Teen Titans.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
We may not catch any fish,

00:32.119 --> 00:35.122
but something tells me we're
going to catch a lot of laughs.

00:35.165 --> 00:38.081
If the jokes are too small,
we'll have to throw them back.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.955
Okay, I'll throw it back.

00:44.914 --> 00:45.871
What's that noise?

00:45.915 --> 00:47.960
It sounds so familiar.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.966
Weird, why would we, the Teen
Titans, be alerted to a crime?

00:54.010 --> 00:56.665
I know this sounds crazy,

00:56.708 --> 00:59.885
but I think we're supposed
to be superheroes!

00:59.929 --> 01:01.539
Don't you remember?

01:01.583 --> 01:04.542
We used to fight tirelessly to save lives and inspire hearts.

01:04.586 --> 01:09.243
We waged battle with evil itself in the name of justice.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.507
Oh!

01:12.550 --> 01:14.378
- I got it!
- Okay.

01:14.422 --> 01:17.555
How could we have forgotten the core
aspect of what makes us who we are?

01:17.599 --> 01:19.818
I guess we've been busy
with other things.

01:19.862 --> 01:20.993
Like eating hot peppers.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.560
Magical bathroom adventures.

01:22.604 --> 01:23.779
Rollerbladings.

01:23.822 --> 01:24.954
Dressing up like Grandma.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.869
Totally organic crossovers.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.611
Oh, and learning the value of the real estate investments.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.352
Those were all
a waste of our time!

01:31.395 --> 01:34.311
Except for the real estate advice,
that's a much better use of money

01:34.355 --> 01:37.793
than, say, an unjustifiably expensive college education.

01:37.836 --> 01:42.014
The Brain is on a rampage,
and only we can stop him!

01:42.058 --> 01:46.193
We are superheroes,
and it's time to act like it!

01:46.236 --> 01:48.804
But we have forgotten
how to be the heroes.

01:48.847 --> 01:51.372
I have no doubt
it will come back to us.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.851
Titans!

01:52.895 --> 01:55.027
Why did you just yell, "Titans"?

01:55.071 --> 01:57.987
I don't know, it just came out of my
mouth when I was starting to leave,

01:58.030 --> 02:00.163
but I feel like there's
more to it.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.949
Careful with the generator.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.778
It is crucial to my plan
for world domination.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.172
Your plan stops here, Brain!

02:11.653 --> 02:13.568
Oh, the Teen Titans.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.875
I must admit, I'm surprised
to see you here.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.268
We may be a little rusty,

02:18.312 --> 02:20.966
but when evil threatens
the good people of the world,

02:21.010 --> 02:22.838
the Teen Titans will be there!

02:22.881 --> 02:24.840
Titans! Uh...

02:24.883 --> 02:26.363
Titans, what?

02:26.407 --> 02:27.799
I'm still drawing a blank here.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.062
- Titans...
- Eat tacos?

02:30.106 --> 02:32.239
No, that's not right.
Help me out.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.067
- Titans...
- Enter a surfing competition?

02:35.111 --> 02:36.243
Take a vacay to Croatia?

02:36.286 --> 02:38.941
No, no. It was something
quick and energetic.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.900
- Titans...
- Commune with nature?

02:41.944 --> 02:43.032
Pet the kitty?

02:43.075 --> 02:45.034
No, no, no, no.
It's, uh...

02:45.077 --> 02:46.209
Titans...

02:52.433 --> 02:55.218
All right, they've got the
generator, but it's not too late.

02:55.262 --> 02:59.222
We just need to get inside and destroy
it to stop Brain's evil plan.

02:59.266 --> 03:02.225
Again, I think we should ask
someone else to handle this.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.531
There is no one else!

03:03.574 --> 03:06.273
We are the bulwark upon which
evil breaks, okay?

03:06.316 --> 03:09.232
Fine. "Bulwark." Whatevs.
How do we get inside?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.973
First, we need to take out
that robot guard.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.324
Uh, anyone remember
how to do that?

03:14.368 --> 03:17.022
Yo, that's my specialty.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.198
I'm on it.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.506

04:07.421 --> 04:08.465
Oh!

04:09.727 --> 04:11.729
Dang. Beasty is totally
taking that robot out.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.166
A special meal
for a special robot.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.997
My man made those
good shrimps and prime rib.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.652
The most romantic foods of all.

04:21.696 --> 04:24.481
Shh! Quiet! Beast Boy
is about to finish him off.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.441
- It is getting late.
- I better get going.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.486
Let me walks you home, baby.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.404
I had a great time
with you tonight.

04:39.409 --> 04:42.412
- That is my father.
- I better go inside.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.982
Yeah! I still gots it!

04:47.025 --> 04:50.115
Friend Beast Boy has successfully
taken out the guard.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.030
We are free to enter
The Brain's lair.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.468
You were supposed to take
it out like a superhero.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.991
Using your powers!

04:56.034 --> 04:58.298
Oh, I did. With the power
of love, yo.

04:58.515 --> 04:59.995
Let's just get in there.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.824
We are the only heroes
that can save Jump City.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.521
Titans! Um...

05:04.565 --> 05:05.827
Still can't remember?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.350
It's on the tip of my tongue.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.222
Titans!
Uh, walla-walla-bing-bang.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.269
Titans... Shama-lama-moo-moo.
No, that's yours.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.315
Gotta remember!

05:19.623 --> 05:22.365
We need to bypass that camera
without being seen.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.714
We'll have to be...

05:23.758 --> 05:25.194
Cr-cr-crafty.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.588
We are the craftiest!

05:39.034 --> 05:42.603
The glitter robot.
Her name is the Barbara Anne.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.083
I made a robot too!
His name is Kevin.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.607
Hey, there, Barbara Anne,

05:46.650 --> 05:48.739
Hello, the Kevin.
I'm gonna kiss you.

05:48.783 --> 05:52.700
- Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.
- Stop it, Barbara Anne, that tickles.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.442
Superheroes do not play with glitter glue.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.400
But you told us to be the crafty.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.403
How is this pre-school garbage
supposed to get us

06:00.447 --> 06:02.274
past the security camera?

06:02.318 --> 06:03.885
This is the how.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.584
Oh, hey, there, Barbara Anne.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.238
Whatcha doin'?

06:09.281 --> 06:12.284
Oh, I'm giving out the kisses today.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.548
How does that sound, you big robot boy?

06:14.591 --> 06:17.072
- Oh, that sounds lovely.
- Kiss, kiss.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.291
- Um, oh. That's nice.
- Kiss, kiss, kiss.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.119
Oh, Kevin, you dog.

06:33.044 --> 06:36.091
Getting past these defenses will
require some fancy footwork.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.309
Fancy footwork.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.450
No, your powers!
Use your superpowers!

06:49.670 --> 06:51.411
All right! Oh!

07:04.946 --> 07:06.643
Fancy enough for you?

07:06.687 --> 07:08.515
It was too fancy,
that's the problem.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.605
There it is!

07:13.520 --> 07:15.609
Time to take out that generator.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.349
My specialty!

07:17.741 --> 07:21.005
Who's getting all the shrimps
and the prime rib, generator?

07:30.319 --> 07:31.320
Gasp!

07:32.495 --> 07:34.105
Baby, it's not
what it looks like!

07:44.551 --> 07:46.553
Destroy them.

07:46.596 --> 07:47.597
Run!

07:49.469 --> 07:53.429
We blew it! All that goofing around
and being silly ruined this mission!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.692
- What are we gonna do?
- You know what to do!

07:55.736 --> 07:57.564
Deep in your hearts, you know!

07:57.607 --> 07:59.522
You mean, use our superpowers?

07:59.566 --> 08:01.655
But I do not remember how!

08:01.698 --> 08:03.178
It's like riding a bike.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.093
Just try, and you'll remember!

08:05.136 --> 08:08.009
Titans... Titans...
Titans, go!

08:18.802 --> 08:20.674
Boo-yeah!

08:34.296 --> 08:36.080
Back off, Mallah.

08:36.124 --> 08:40.650
Jump City's one and only superhero
team is back and stronger than ever!

08:46.395 --> 08:49.572
I thought you said that only we could
do the savings of the daylights.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.183
Obviously, we're not the only
heroes in the game.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.446
But only we can destroy
that generator and...

09:06.284 --> 09:08.591
Wow.
Sure are a lot of superheroes.

09:08.635 --> 09:12.813
Heh. But they're going to need
our help to take down The Brain.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.997
I'd like to see you try, Titans.

09:29.656 --> 09:33.964
Curse you.
Curse you all! My plan is ruined!

09:34.008 --> 09:35.618
Ahhh!

09:35.662 --> 09:37.707
Looks like they gots it
under control, yo.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.448
Yeah.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.929
I guess the world
doesn't need us after all.

09:42.799 --> 09:46.281
Hey, there may be a lot of superheroes
keeping the world safe...

09:46.324 --> 09:49.850
But they ain't dancing around and
acting the fool like us, yo.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.547
That's right.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.289
Only the Teen Titans have the power
to sing dumb songs about food

09:54.332 --> 09:55.551
or whatever.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.380
And if we do not do it,
no one will.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.339
Then let's do what we do best!
