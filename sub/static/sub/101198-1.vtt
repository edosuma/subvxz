04:10.800 --> 04:12.468
About time.
Where the hell you been?

04:12.502 --> 04:13.703
Oh, come on, man.
Give me a break.

04:13.736 --> 04:16.105
- I got here as soon as I could.
- Well, not soon enough.

04:16.139 --> 04:17.374
We can't afford to
fall behind today, yeah?

04:17.406 --> 04:18.642
A lot of shit to do.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.245
You know, Dan, if you're
really in so much of a rush,

04:21.277 --> 04:23.013
then maybe you shouldn't wait
until the very last minute

04:23.045 --> 04:25.882
to send me your list.
Yeah?

04:25.915 --> 04:27.950
Well, maybe you should
get to the market sooner.

04:27.984 --> 04:29.453
I was here till
3 o'clock last night.

04:29.485 --> 04:30.953
So fuckin' what?
I never left.

04:30.986 --> 04:32.288
You got a problem?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:32.322 --> 04:33.956
Hey, hey, hey,
look at me.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.826
You got a problem with
my process all of a sudden?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.360
No.
I'm just saying it's not like

04:37.394 --> 04:38.961
I was out there
jerking off or something.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.564
I've been sourcing ingredients
for you all morning.

04:40.596 --> 04:42.231
That's your job.

04:42.264 --> 04:43.432
It's not like you're doing
me some kind of favour.

04:43.466 --> 04:44.300
That's not what I mean.

04:44.334 --> 04:45.300
We're done
talking about this.

04:45.334 --> 04:46.001
- Is that everything I asked for?
- Yeah.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.539
Good.
Start prepping!

04:48.572 --> 04:50.973
Yes, Chef.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.487
Next to you.
What's next?

05:03.519 --> 05:05.021
That's enough.
I need you guys

05:05.055 --> 05:06.490
to do these three bags.

05:06.523 --> 05:07.858
I need them done
in like 15 minutes, okay?

05:07.891 --> 05:09.092
Okay.

05:13.295 --> 05:15.432
Ah, you're picking out
some , eh?

05:15.464 --> 05:17.233
You wanna go grab some
for these guys?

05:17.266 --> 05:19.502
Help 'em out?
Teach 'em how to cut.

05:22.471 --> 05:24.173
So...?

05:24.206 --> 05:27.043
Taste it.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.077
It's not bad.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.545
Wait for it.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.014
See?

05:31.047 --> 05:32.115
That's how you know
it's a little bit old.

05:32.148 --> 05:33.116
- Yeah.
- Okay?

05:33.149 --> 05:34.617
- These are good.
- Mm-hm.

05:34.651 --> 05:36.485
These are good.

05:36.519 --> 05:39.122
Smell that, that's good.

05:39.154 --> 05:41.024
There you go.
Good job, good job.

05:41.057 --> 05:42.391
These are shit, though.
They look shit.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.062
Alright.
Alright.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.232
You're the chef.

06:19.262 --> 06:20.396
- Hey.
- Uh-huh?

06:20.430 --> 06:21.531
- Here you are.
- Mm-hm.

06:21.564 --> 06:23.966
Thought maybe you
got hit by a bus or something,

06:24.000 --> 06:25.035
but I guess not.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.002
What are you talking about?

06:26.036 --> 06:28.071
You said you'd
come by last night,

06:28.103 --> 06:30.606
- and then radio silence.
- No, I remember that.

06:30.639 --> 06:32.375
I remember saying
I'd <i>try</i> to come by, <i>try.</i>

06:32.408 --> 06:33.576
Emphasis on "try."

06:33.610 --> 06:35.145
Well, I waited up.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.379
Well, you shouldn't have.

06:36.413 --> 06:38.482
I was working.

06:38.514 --> 06:41.685
Hm, that's
one way of putting it.

06:41.718 --> 06:44.087
Okay, Chloe, look.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.122
The best time for me to
menu plan is after hours.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.057
It's the only time I get any
peace and quiet around here.

06:48.091 --> 06:50.026
You still could call.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.394
You know, that's what people do.

06:51.427 --> 06:53.096
- Okay.
- You know, right, right.

06:53.129 --> 06:55.265
I... sorry, I forgot
who I was talking to.

06:55.298 --> 06:57.531
Well, you could at least make
an effort to pick up the phone

06:57.533 --> 06:58.668
when I call you.

06:58.701 --> 07:00.370
Chloe, I am busy.

07:00.403 --> 07:02.004
Do you have anything urgent
you want to discuss,

07:02.038 --> 07:03.372
preferably work-related?

07:03.406 --> 07:05.242
Or is this all gonna be
about the airing of your

07:05.274 --> 07:07.144
trivial personal grievances?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.479
Oh, hey.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.213
Uh, Ray's upstairs pouring some
of the new stuff from his book.

07:11.247 --> 07:12.649
I figured you'd want
to taste with us.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.685
Yes, I would love that,
Steven, thank you.

07:14.718 --> 07:16.687
See?
I'm busy.

07:20.656 --> 07:23.392
I mean...
it's pretty.

07:23.425 --> 07:25.361
It's pretty.
But, like, it has no depth.

07:25.394 --> 07:27.463
It has...
this is a table wine.

07:27.497 --> 07:29.633
Hi, this is Chloe from
L'Asange, I'm calling...

07:29.665 --> 07:31.067
It's a nice a table wine.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.569
I'm not... you know.
Alright.

07:32.601 --> 07:35.638
...7:30 tonight.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.675
Okay.
Okay, great, we'll see you then.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.210
Thank you.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.215
Oh...
Right.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.750
I like this
for the pork belly.

07:46.783 --> 07:49.086
You don't think
something a bit more acidic

07:49.119 --> 07:51.088
would stand up to it better?
Like, maybe...

07:51.120 --> 07:52.555
an off-dry Riesling.

07:52.588 --> 07:54.223
You know, something
with a touch of sweetness.

07:54.257 --> 07:55.692
Oh, come on.
No, no, no.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.326
I can't go back to white
at that point in the sequence.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.496
It's gotta be the Pino.

07:59.528 --> 08:01.098
It's gotta... what, don't...
you're just looking at me like...

08:01.130 --> 08:02.531
We can try it.

08:02.564 --> 08:04.067
- Come on, come on.
- So sorry to interrupt.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.268
Can I talk to you for a sec?

08:05.300 --> 08:06.435
Well, one second...
I'm, I'm...

08:06.468 --> 08:08.771
It will
just take a minute.

08:08.805 --> 08:12.509
Alright.

08:12.541 --> 08:15.678
Uh, so I was going over
the reservations for tonight,

08:15.711 --> 08:17.747
and there is a name
with no contact info.

08:17.781 --> 08:20.016
I know I didn't book it.
Evans, four people, at 8 pm.

08:20.050 --> 08:21.384
Yeah, that's...
that's my friends.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.353
- Oh, okay.
- That's me.

08:22.386 --> 08:23.620
Sorry, I didn't
recognize the name.

08:23.653 --> 08:26.055
Do you have a contact number
you want me to call to confirm?

08:26.088 --> 08:27.290
Nope.

08:27.322 --> 08:28.457
It's good.
They're coming.

08:28.490 --> 08:29.658
- You sure about that?
- Mm-hm.

08:29.692 --> 08:31.328
Okay, if you say so.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.761
I do.

08:32.794 --> 08:34.296
- We done?
- Yeah.

08:34.328 --> 08:37.700
- I can go... back?
- Yeah.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.269
Hello?

08:39.302 --> 08:41.538
Uh, yeah,
hey, Ev, it's Dan.

08:41.571 --> 08:42.806
Yeah, I know.
What's up?

08:42.837 --> 08:44.673
Uh, nothing.
I just, um...

08:44.706 --> 08:47.343
I'm calling to make sure
that we're still on for tonight.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.413
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Why wouldn't we be?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.447
Uh, I don't know.
No reason.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.783
I'm just... I just was
calling to make a...

08:53.817 --> 08:56.253
Uh... so it's gonna be
four people, right?

08:56.285 --> 08:57.319
That's right.

08:57.352 --> 08:58.587
Cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.756
And 8 o'clock?
We're still on, 8 o'clock?

09:00.789 --> 09:02.125
Yeah, see you later.

09:02.158 --> 09:05.228
Cool, cool.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.463
Uh, Dan,
you got a visitor.

09:07.496 --> 09:08.531
What?
Who?

09:08.565 --> 09:09.766
Sid.

09:09.798 --> 09:11.400
No...
He's not here, is he?

09:11.433 --> 09:12.836
Yeah,
he's waiting at the bar.

09:12.869 --> 09:15.105
Jesus Christ, I can't
deal with his shit right now.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.473
You gotta run interference.

09:16.505 --> 09:17.740
Er, what does that mean?

09:17.774 --> 09:20.443
Like, go and be
a buffer or something.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.677
Like, work your feminine charms.

09:21.711 --> 09:22.812
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:22.846 --> 09:24.847
I didn't realize that was
part of my job description.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.315
That's, like,
practically the essence

09:26.349 --> 09:27.451
of your job description.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.152
Ha-ha, screw you, Dan.

09:29.184 --> 09:31.687
I have a lot of responsibilities
around here that don't involve

09:31.721 --> 09:34.157
batting my eyelashes
at the landlord.

09:34.190 --> 09:35.759
Hey, hey, calm down!
I'm joking.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.627
- I was joking.
- You're not funny.

09:37.659 --> 09:39.195
I know.
Look, just...

09:39.229 --> 09:41.098
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

09:41.130 --> 09:42.399
I take it back.

09:42.432 --> 09:44.801
You are indispensable
to the smooth functioning

09:44.833 --> 09:47.136
of this establishment, okay?

09:47.169 --> 09:48.538
Yeah, okay.

09:48.571 --> 09:50.673
Okay, now you gotta
go tell him that I'm not here.

09:50.706 --> 09:51.841
Uh, yeah, that's
not gonna work either.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.210
Why not?

09:53.243 --> 09:54.344
'Cause he
knows you're here.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.577
How does
he know I'm here?

09:55.611 --> 09:58.448
He knows you're here
because you're always here, Dan.

10:00.884 --> 10:02.418
Alright, alright.

10:02.451 --> 10:03.754
I'm gonna... deal with it.

10:06.155 --> 10:07.323
There he is!

10:07.356 --> 10:09.759
Il padrone!

10:09.792 --> 10:11.161
How are ya?

10:11.193 --> 10:12.628
Danny.

10:12.662 --> 10:13.495
Yeah.

10:13.529 --> 10:15.264
It's good to...
it's good to see you.

10:15.298 --> 10:17.200
Looking very well.
Retirement's suiting you.

10:17.232 --> 10:19.602
Semi-retirement.
Not out to pasture just yet.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.637
Right, I didn't...
okay, so do you want a drink

10:21.671 --> 10:22.806
or something?
I can fix you...

10:22.839 --> 10:25.375
- What do you want?
- It's barely noon.

10:25.408 --> 10:26.543
Okay, so let's...

10:26.576 --> 10:27.744
Well, you wanna talk upstairs?

10:27.777 --> 10:30.280
Let's get outta here.
Let's, um...

10:40.190 --> 10:41.591
Sure I can't
get you anything, Sid?

10:41.624 --> 10:44.461
Espresso or a seltzer
or something?

10:44.494 --> 10:46.463
Cut the shit.

10:46.495 --> 10:47.697
Uh...

10:47.730 --> 10:49.633
just trying to make
you feel welcome.

10:49.666 --> 10:50.700
I'm just trying to
be a mensch here.

10:50.732 --> 10:51.834
Well, it's my building.

10:51.868 --> 10:52.903
You don't need to
make me feel welcome.

10:52.936 --> 10:53.804
And you wanna be a mensch?

10:53.836 --> 10:56.773
- Start by paying your rent.
- Okay...

10:56.806 --> 10:58.807
I'm assuming that means that you
didn't get the cheque I sent?

10:58.841 --> 11:00.509
- 'Cause...
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:00.543 --> 11:02.512
- Yeah, I got it, alright.
- Okay.

11:02.544 --> 11:03.879
It bounced.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.649
Just like the last one,
and the one before that.

11:05.682 --> 11:07.683
I didn't know that.

11:07.716 --> 11:10.386
I said
cut the shit already!

11:10.419 --> 11:13.189
I have been calling you for
weeks, leaving you messages.

11:13.222 --> 11:14.591
You're dodging me
and you know it.

11:14.624 --> 11:15.892
I am not dodging you, Sid!

11:15.924 --> 11:17.426
I'm just busy.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.863
Oh, I'm sorry you're busy.

11:19.895 --> 11:21.964
Uh, forget about it, then.
Don't worry.

11:21.998 --> 11:23.500
Really?
That's your excuse, huh?

11:23.533 --> 11:24.901
It's not...

11:24.933 --> 11:26.669
It's not an excuse.
It's just...

11:26.702 --> 11:27.971
it's just the truth, Sid.

11:28.004 --> 11:29.839
Well, we're all
busy these days, Danny.

11:29.871 --> 11:32.775
I'm supposed to be semi-retired.
I'm up to my eyeballs in busy.

11:32.808 --> 11:34.443
I don't know what
you want me to tell ya.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.444
I got a full plate
I'm dealing with.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.979
So what?

11:37.013 --> 11:38.615
Does that mean that you don't
have to pay your rent anymore?

11:38.648 --> 11:40.683
Or answer your phone?

11:40.716 --> 11:43.319
I should not have to come
all the way down here

11:43.352 --> 11:45.487
to hound you like you're
some sort of a deadbeat.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.591
I got better things
to do, you know?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.392
I'll level with you.
I...

11:49.424 --> 11:52.461
I got a bit of a cash flow
situation right now.

11:52.495 --> 11:53.730
I'm just in
a bit of a hole,

11:53.763 --> 11:54.931
but I'm digging
myself out of it.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.933
I got a thing tonight that's
gonna solve all my problems.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.301
Tonight.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.935
That's what
they all say, Danny.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.538
You're nearly
four months behind.

12:01.571 --> 12:03.406
I can't just keep
letting that go on.

12:03.438 --> 12:05.641
You're talking like
this is a chronic problem.

12:05.674 --> 12:07.810
This has never happened before.
This is...

12:07.844 --> 12:09.412
You know it's never
happened before.

12:09.445 --> 12:10.480
This is a blip.
It's a...

12:10.513 --> 12:11.748
it's a... aberration.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.816
It's a temporary
issue, that's it.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.951
I don't know what
you want me to do for you.

12:15.985 --> 12:19.288
I just want you
to cut me a break!

12:19.322 --> 12:20.624
You can do that
for me, right, Sid?

12:20.657 --> 12:21.891
Sid, come on.

12:21.923 --> 12:24.494
Just like a reprieve,
a little... a break.

12:24.527 --> 12:25.395
For old times' sake?

12:25.427 --> 12:27.730
I have given you
plenty of breaks.

12:32.335 --> 12:36.605
If you don't want to
give me a break, maybe...

12:36.639 --> 12:40.509
you'd give one for Jack?

12:43.446 --> 12:45.348
You see?

12:45.380 --> 12:49.485
There was a mensch.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.988
It's not the word
I would use, but that's...

12:52.020 --> 12:53.789
I know you two
had your differences,

12:53.822 --> 12:55.557
but he bankrolled this
restaurant for you.

12:55.591 --> 12:57.394
He didn't bankroll, I...

12:57.427 --> 12:58.861
He left me the money.

12:58.894 --> 13:00.764
- I started the...
- Okay, either way,

13:00.797 --> 13:01.998
he was always
a good friend to me.

13:02.030 --> 13:03.866
Okay, so...

13:05.934 --> 13:08.737
Do we have
an accommodation here?

13:08.770 --> 13:11.741
Sid...
Sid...

13:17.379 --> 13:19.014
Alright, I will give you
to the end of the month

13:19.048 --> 13:21.784
to get square, but after that,
all bets are off.

13:21.817 --> 13:23.086
Fine, good, great.

13:23.119 --> 13:24.553
That's... thank you,
thank you.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.722
Okay, no, listen, Danny.

13:26.755 --> 13:29.326
I'm willing to do you
this favour today,

13:29.359 --> 13:31.661
but make no mistake,
push comes to shove,

13:31.693 --> 13:34.963
I will not hesitate to sue you
for defaulting on the lease.

13:34.996 --> 13:37.900
Never mind your father, I will
get the bailiff to evict you,

13:37.933 --> 13:39.735
and I will sue you for
everything that you owe me,

13:39.769 --> 13:43.005
plus interest.
You understand?

13:45.875 --> 13:47.844
Your shirt's inside out.

13:54.850 --> 13:56.820
Everything okay?

13:56.852 --> 13:58.420
Huh?
With what?

13:58.453 --> 13:59.888
With Sid.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.791
Oh, yeah, no, Sid.
He's, uh...

14:01.823 --> 14:04.460
You know, he's Sid.
He just likes to bust chops.

14:04.494 --> 14:05.729
Makes him feel alive.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.699
What the fuck is
going on across the street?

14:09.731 --> 14:10.933
They got a line-up
halfway down the block.

14:10.966 --> 14:12.369
Huh?

14:12.402 --> 14:13.103
It's just another
food truck, right?

14:13.135 --> 14:14.403
Like, what am I missing?

14:14.437 --> 14:16.472
Oh, no, no, these guys
are more like the hottest thing

14:16.505 --> 14:17.841
in town.
DAN:

14:17.874 --> 14:19.576
- What?
- Barf.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.078
It's true!
They have this huge following.

14:22.110 --> 14:24.547
They post their location
every day on social media,

14:24.580 --> 14:26.716
- and the fans coming running.
- I know how it works.

14:26.749 --> 14:28.418
I just don't understand how
it's still a trend, you know,

14:28.451 --> 14:30.052
how much longer people
want to eat on the sidewalk.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.653
You might actually
like their stuff.

14:31.687 --> 14:33.456
It's pretty playful
and innovative.

14:33.489 --> 14:35.759
I do not need
to try a new gimmicky take

14:35.792 --> 14:37.527
on fusion street food.

14:37.559 --> 14:38.827
They got
pretty great reviews.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.432
Come on, Chloe, you know that
critics are bullshit, right?

14:43.466 --> 14:45.668
They're all just lemmings
out desperately looking

14:45.701 --> 14:47.170
for the next
flavour of the month.

14:47.202 --> 14:49.605
- That's it.
- Fine.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.609
But people seem to really like
what these guys are doing.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.478
Plus, it doesn't hurt
that they are young and hot.

14:57.947 --> 14:59.581
Well, you just
proved my point now.

14:59.615 --> 15:00.783
Hm?

15:00.817 --> 15:01.985
That's... that's...

15:02.018 --> 15:04.821
now, that's really a case of
style over substance, right?

15:04.854 --> 15:07.557
Flash and hyperbole over...

15:07.590 --> 15:10.593
over real achievement,
real ambition.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.995
They're... they're...
they're just... they're tweets,

15:13.028 --> 15:15.798
and they're faves, and they're
likes, and that's it!

15:15.831 --> 15:19.001
They're just superficial
fuckin' bullshit, Chloe!

15:19.034 --> 15:20.602
Okay...

15:20.635 --> 15:24.506
Hey, you asked me about
the truck, and I told you.

15:24.539 --> 15:26.642
I'm on your side, remember?

15:32.481 --> 15:33.716
You tell Liam and Pedro

15:33.749 --> 15:35.084
they gotta move
these tables for me?

15:35.116 --> 15:37.120
Yes.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.122
Thank you.

15:43.960 --> 15:48.531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:48.563 --> 15:50.599
She's a beaut, huh?

15:52.235 --> 15:53.937
Best you got, right?

15:53.970 --> 15:55.538
Are you kidding me?

15:55.571 --> 15:58.641
I mean, it doesn't get
better than a Mangalitsa.

15:58.673 --> 16:01.644
Just check out the belly.
Look at the marbling.

16:01.677 --> 16:03.812
It's... it's, uh...

16:03.846 --> 16:05.981
Yeah, it's a little pricy, yeah?
It's pricy.

16:06.014 --> 16:07.649
Will you knock it down
for me a little bit?

16:07.682 --> 16:09.619
I don't know, man.
You get what you pay for.

16:09.652 --> 16:12.754
That's premium-grade,
top-of-the-line.

16:12.788 --> 16:14.724
Look, I got other
heritage breeds

16:14.756 --> 16:16.525
if this is out of your league.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.594
I mean, the Berkshires
are damn fine animals too.

16:18.628 --> 16:20.028
No, yeah, yeah.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.563
I want...
I want the Mangalitsa.

16:21.596 --> 16:26.602
Alright, then.

16:26.635 --> 16:29.105
You gonna get it
down for me, or...?

16:52.794 --> 16:54.596
You want a hand?

16:54.629 --> 16:55.932
I got it.

16:55.965 --> 16:59.101
- You sure?
- Yeah.

17:34.604 --> 17:37.874
You mother... fucker...

17:47.148 --> 17:50.252
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:58.059 --> 17:59.662
Hello?

17:59.694 --> 18:01.663
Hi, may I
speak to Daniel Bitterman,

18:01.696 --> 18:03.031
- please?
- Bieterman.

18:03.065 --> 18:04.866
I beg your pardon,
Daniel Bieterman.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.336
Yeah, it's Daniel.
Who is this?

18:06.368 --> 18:07.503
How'd you get this number?
It's a private line.

18:07.537 --> 18:10.606
My name is Beth Childres.
I work for Insatiable.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.275
I... don't know
what that is.

18:12.307 --> 18:15.010
It's a website about food
culture and the culinary arts.

18:15.044 --> 18:16.211
Ooh, food culture, huh?

18:16.244 --> 18:17.813
Not just plain old
food, full-stop.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.248
Ooh-la-la.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.017
Call it what you will,
I write a restaurant blog.

18:21.049 --> 18:22.851
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I don't read blogs.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.319
Well,
I'm working on a piece

18:24.353 --> 18:25.855
that I think you might
be interested in.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.389
Why is that?

18:27.423 --> 18:30.125
Because it concerns your
chef de cuisine, Keith Griffin.

18:30.159 --> 18:34.263
Or should I say your soon-to-be
ex-chef de cuisine.

18:34.296 --> 18:35.832
What are you talking about?

18:35.865 --> 18:38.668
You really
don't know, do you?

18:38.701 --> 18:40.604
Know what?

18:49.111 --> 18:50.913
When were you
gonna fuckin' tell me?

18:50.945 --> 18:53.750
- Tell you what?
- Don't play dumb with me.

18:53.782 --> 18:57.019
I just got off the phone
with a writer from some website

18:57.053 --> 19:01.057
asking for my comment on your
departure from my employ.

19:01.089 --> 19:03.259
Comment, mind you,
not confirmation...

19:03.291 --> 19:04.926
she had that already.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.929
So, apparently,
this is a done deal,

19:06.961 --> 19:09.298
and that's how
I find out about it.

19:09.330 --> 19:11.199
From a fucking blogger!

19:11.232 --> 19:12.300
What do you
want me to say?

19:12.334 --> 19:14.370
I wasn't looking to leave, okay?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.739
The Vortex people came to me
and made a crazy offer.

19:16.771 --> 19:18.707
I would have been an idiot
to turn that down.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.742
Then bring it to me
and see if I can match it!

19:20.776 --> 19:21.811
Match it?

19:21.844 --> 19:23.112
Are you kidding me?
No!

19:23.144 --> 19:25.181
No, you would have
just gone ballistic, man.

19:25.213 --> 19:26.448
You don't know that's true.

19:26.481 --> 19:28.050
Oh, come on, Dan.

19:28.084 --> 19:31.120
This is...
this is a big bump.

19:31.153 --> 19:33.122
I mean, real bennies,
the whole package.

19:33.154 --> 19:34.856
There's no way you could
afford to match that, man.

19:34.890 --> 19:36.292
What... what
does that mean?

19:36.325 --> 19:37.860
You don't know what
I can and can't afford!

19:37.893 --> 19:39.261
Whatever!

19:39.295 --> 19:41.397
It's not about
the money anyways.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.200
Not really.

19:44.232 --> 19:46.868
They're making me
executive chef.

19:46.902 --> 19:47.970
No one above me.

19:48.002 --> 19:51.106
I get to call
the shots there.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.943
Wow.

19:53.976 --> 19:57.180
And... this is
how you repay me?

19:57.212 --> 19:59.715
Repay you?

19:59.749 --> 20:01.784
For everything
I taught you.

20:01.817 --> 20:05.788
Which, by the way,
is every fucking thing you know,

20:05.820 --> 20:09.257
because you were a fucking
dish-washer when you came here!

20:09.290 --> 20:11.860
And I busted my ass
for you for years!

20:11.894 --> 20:13.996
I've had no life
outside of this place

20:14.028 --> 20:15.330
for as long as I
can remember, Dan.

20:15.364 --> 20:16.466
So I don't owe you shit!

20:16.499 --> 20:19.067
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

20:19.101 --> 20:22.171
You owe me everything!

20:22.203 --> 20:24.874
You wouldn't have gotten
that offer if it wasn't for me.

20:24.906 --> 20:26.341
You wouldn't have
even gotten close to it.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.510
You were nobody!

20:28.544 --> 20:31.347
You had no training,
no experience.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.849
You were nothing.

20:32.882 --> 20:35.985
And I,
I saw something in you.

20:36.018 --> 20:38.954
Mm-hm.
I recognized your talent.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.257
I nurtured your abilities.

20:41.289 --> 20:44.026
I lowered the ladder down to you

20:44.058 --> 20:46.394
and pulled you up
from the fucking muck.

20:46.428 --> 20:49.232
And I'm grateful to you,
Dan, always will be.

20:49.265 --> 20:51.501
But I've climbed as
high as I could here.

20:51.534 --> 20:55.171
I've hit my head on the ceiling.
Can't you see that?

20:55.203 --> 20:58.840
Look, you said
that you're not a real chef

20:58.874 --> 21:02.010
as long as you're grinding
for somebody else, right?

21:02.044 --> 21:03.412
Right?

21:03.444 --> 21:04.946
You gotta have
your own kitchen,

21:04.980 --> 21:06.883
be your own boss,
cook your own food.

21:06.915 --> 21:10.552
That was your
fucking mantra, Dan!

21:10.586 --> 21:13.522
I was talking about myself!

21:13.556 --> 21:15.525
Yeah.

21:15.557 --> 21:16.959
Yeah, of course you were.

21:16.991 --> 21:19.961
Mm-hm.

21:19.994 --> 21:21.062
Ah...

21:21.096 --> 21:22.531
You know, if this
is how you feel,

21:22.565 --> 21:24.567
maybe you just get your shit
and get out of here, you know?

21:24.599 --> 21:27.903
It doesn't have
to be like this, you know?

21:27.936 --> 21:30.005
We can go our separate ways
with mutual respect.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.807
No fireworks, no drama.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.009
- Mutual respect.
- Yeah.

21:34.042 --> 21:38.246
Like normal colleagues.

21:38.279 --> 21:41.917
Friends, even.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.524
Who the fuck
said we were friends?

21:58.901 --> 22:00.603
Fine.

22:00.635 --> 22:03.373
Have it your way.
You always do.

22:37.006 --> 22:39.242
You fired Keith?

22:39.275 --> 22:43.613
Judas...?
Was it Brutus?

22:43.645 --> 22:46.182
One of those dudes.

22:46.214 --> 22:48.583
That's a little much,
don't you think?

22:48.616 --> 22:50.385
No, I don't think
it's a little much, Chloe.

22:50.419 --> 22:52.622
He literally betrayed me.

22:52.654 --> 22:55.324
He stabbed me in the back.
Or he...

22:55.356 --> 22:57.292
went behind my back, and...

22:57.326 --> 22:58.627
Whatever it was,
my back was...

22:58.661 --> 23:01.130
Look, textbook betrayal!

23:01.163 --> 23:03.466
Maybe it all
came out in an awkward way,

23:03.499 --> 23:05.902
but Keith is not a snake.
He is not sneaky.

23:05.934 --> 23:08.236
It was just time
for him to move on.

23:08.269 --> 23:09.939
Look, I get it.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.440
You like Keith.

23:11.472 --> 23:13.942
Everybody likes Keith;
he's a great guy.

23:13.976 --> 23:14.877
But here's what you
don't understand.

23:14.911 --> 23:16.679
This isn't just
a personal affront to me,

23:16.711 --> 23:19.115
or some professional
falling out where, like,

23:19.147 --> 23:21.483
the protege is splitting up
with the mentor

23:21.517 --> 23:22.919
and striking out on his own,
and blah-blah-blah.

23:22.951 --> 23:24.153
No.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.521
I invested in him.

23:26.555 --> 23:31.626
I invested time
and energy and expertise...

23:31.660 --> 23:34.230
Resources!

23:34.262 --> 23:37.265
And now this Vortex group
is gonna swoop in

23:37.298 --> 23:40.102
and reap the dividends.

23:40.134 --> 23:43.105
They get my methods,
my recipes, my secrets.

23:43.137 --> 23:46.975
These are things I shared
with Keith in good faith.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.411
You don't know that
he's just gonna make some

23:48.443 --> 23:50.346
copy-cat menu for them.

23:50.378 --> 23:53.715
Chloe, why do you
think they hired him?

23:53.749 --> 23:56.218
For his fucking vision?

23:56.250 --> 23:59.355
He had no track record
outside of me!

23:59.387 --> 24:02.191
He's got... he's got
no credentials!

24:02.223 --> 24:06.428
They want to steal my ideas,
and then make some shitty,

24:06.461 --> 24:09.065
knock-off, assembly-line
version of my cuisine.

24:09.097 --> 24:10.633
And Keith is gonna
give it to 'em.

24:10.665 --> 24:13.568
He's gonna implement
some soulless corporate

24:13.602 --> 24:17.006
hospitality group's ersatz
"bistronomy" concept?

24:17.038 --> 24:18.273
Well, fuck him!

24:18.307 --> 24:21.410
And fuck that, and fuck him
for believing in that bullshit!

24:21.442 --> 24:23.645
Okay.

24:23.679 --> 24:27.416
Okay, I see where
you're coming from, Dan.

24:27.449 --> 24:30.318
But I'm sure Keith wasn't
deliberately trying to harm you,

24:30.352 --> 24:31.519
let alone rip you off.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.090
He is just doing
what is best for himself.

24:34.123 --> 24:36.192
You know, advancing his career.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.659
Come on, Chloe.

24:37.692 --> 24:39.595
Why are you defending him to me?
I'm just...

24:39.627 --> 24:42.130
Of course it's understandable
from his point of view!

24:42.163 --> 24:44.333
Yeah, nobody's
a villain to themselves.

24:44.365 --> 24:47.036
Hitler had reasons.

24:47.068 --> 24:50.505
Like, he had a whole
rationale for all that stuff.

24:50.538 --> 24:52.474
In his brain, it all worked out,

24:52.508 --> 24:54.110
and that he was doing the
right thing, but you know what?

24:54.143 --> 24:56.479
He wasn't.
He was the bad guy.

24:58.047 --> 25:00.283
Hitler?

25:04.553 --> 25:06.055
Okay, that analogy's not...

25:06.087 --> 25:08.557
the best, but like,
you get what I'm saying.

25:08.589 --> 25:11.293
Sort of?

25:14.663 --> 25:16.298
Okay.

25:19.701 --> 25:21.336
This isn't about Keith at all.

25:21.369 --> 25:22.771
This is about me.

25:22.805 --> 25:24.073
It's all about me.
I...

25:24.105 --> 25:25.740
I'm the one at fault here.

25:25.773 --> 25:27.475
Wow.

25:27.509 --> 25:29.444
Uh, well, that's certainly
big of you to admit.

25:29.478 --> 25:32.048
Mm-hm.
And a critical mistake.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.715
You should
have treated Keith better

25:33.749 --> 25:36.419
and not taken him for granted?

25:36.451 --> 25:37.787
What?
No.

25:37.819 --> 25:39.587
What?
Opposite!

25:39.621 --> 25:41.390
If anything,
I trusted him too much.

25:41.423 --> 25:43.526
That's the takeaway here.
That's the lesson.

25:43.558 --> 25:45.594
It's a lesson that I gotta learn
over and over and over again,

25:45.626 --> 25:47.163
for some fuckin' reason.

25:47.195 --> 25:48.663
You let people get too close,

25:48.696 --> 25:51.533
and they are
gonna fuck you over.

25:54.403 --> 25:57.640
Sorry, Dan.

25:57.673 --> 26:01.777
To be honest,
I was afraid this might happen.

26:01.809 --> 26:03.711
What?

26:03.744 --> 26:06.614
That you would react
like this when you found out,

26:06.647 --> 26:08.349
- and..
- What are you saying?

26:08.383 --> 26:10.419
You're saying...
What are you saying?

26:10.451 --> 26:13.189
You're saying you knew
that Keith was gonna leave?

26:13.221 --> 26:15.458
Uh...
I mean, uh...

26:15.490 --> 26:17.859
he didn't really
confide in me...

26:17.893 --> 26:20.362
Look, I wasn't 100% sure, I...

26:20.394 --> 26:22.131
- Oh!
- Yeah, okay, yes.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.298
I heard rumblings.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.533
You heard...

26:24.566 --> 26:26.268
Why wouldn't you tell me
the rumblings?!

26:26.300 --> 26:28.403
Well, because
I didn't think it was my place!

26:28.436 --> 26:30.538
And I didn't want
to poison the well.

26:30.571 --> 26:33.575
I figured that Keith
would talk to you directly

26:33.608 --> 26:35.176
if he was gonna make a move,
and I didn't want to

26:35.210 --> 26:36.545
get in the middle of it.

26:36.577 --> 26:38.513
You are my eyes
and ears out there, Chloe!

26:38.547 --> 26:40.149
I...

26:40.182 --> 26:42.351
That is definitely within
your job description!

26:42.384 --> 26:45.386
Okay, it wouldn't have
changed anything, would it?

26:45.420 --> 26:47.323
It absolutely would
have changed things!

26:47.355 --> 26:48.624
How?

26:48.656 --> 26:50.826
I wouldn't have
been blindsided, for one!

26:50.858 --> 26:53.528
I could have prepared
for this eventuality,

26:53.561 --> 26:56.298
and planned
an orderly transition,

26:56.330 --> 26:58.266
instead of being caught
off guard short-handed

26:58.299 --> 27:01.537
tonight of all fuckin' nights!

27:01.569 --> 27:04.307
Now I gotta find
a fuckin' replacement.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.223
Fucker,
fucker, fucker...

27:22.257 --> 27:24.160
Fucker.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.198
Fucker.

27:33.499 --> 27:34.903
Fucker.

27:34.936 --> 27:38.240
God.

27:38.272 --> 27:39.942
Here...

27:39.974 --> 27:44.346
Not a complete asshole.

28:02.463 --> 28:05.833
Ah...

28:12.673 --> 28:14.375
Oh!
Hey, did you find someone?

28:14.409 --> 28:15.811
Um...

28:15.844 --> 28:18.747
I tried, but no one's available
at short notice, and I...

28:18.779 --> 28:20.516
can't be beating
the bushes anymore.

28:20.548 --> 28:22.250
- So...?
- So I'm gonna do it.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.320
- I'm gonna do Keith's job.
- Plus your job?

28:24.353 --> 28:25.888
Yeah, plus my job.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.389
I mean, what choice
do I have, Chloe?

28:27.422 --> 28:28.457
Someone's gotta pick up
the slack around here.

28:28.490 --> 28:30.826
What about Angela?

28:30.858 --> 28:33.428
- The new girl?
- She's not that new.

28:33.461 --> 28:34.730
She's been here
almost six months.

28:34.762 --> 28:37.232
That's nothing.
She is not ready yet.

28:37.266 --> 28:39.935
Is that
because she's a woman?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.503
No, it is not
because she's a woman.

28:41.536 --> 28:42.971
It has to do with experience.

28:43.005 --> 28:44.607
Do you know how long Keith
was here before I promoted him?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.174
- Fine.
- How long?

28:45.207 --> 28:46.709
Do it yourself...

28:46.741 --> 28:48.543
if you think that's the best
use of your resources.

28:48.576 --> 28:52.881
Thank you!

29:55.109 --> 29:58.980
So, as you're aware, Keith
is no longer employed here.

29:59.013 --> 30:00.615
Yes, Chef.

30:00.648 --> 30:02.083
I bet you knew for weeks
that he was leaving.

30:02.116 --> 30:04.920
Apparently everybody here
knew except for me.

30:04.952 --> 30:06.954
But, ah... never mind.

30:06.988 --> 30:08.990
Never mind.
Uh, it's in the past.

30:09.023 --> 30:11.492
We are here to talk
about the present,

30:11.526 --> 30:14.529
and perhaps the future.
Keith is gone,

30:14.563 --> 30:16.465
and that leaves me with
a bit of a problem, right?

30:16.498 --> 30:18.400
Yes, Chef.

30:18.432 --> 30:20.068
So, I understand
you're classically trained.

30:20.102 --> 30:21.603
It says you went to CIA?

30:21.635 --> 30:22.870
Yes, Chef.

30:22.903 --> 30:25.374
That's a good school.
Very...

30:25.406 --> 30:26.942
prestigious.

30:26.974 --> 30:30.511
But basically you have a formal
education and a fancy degree,

30:30.545 --> 30:32.114
but very little in the way
of practical experience.

30:32.146 --> 30:33.715
Would you say
that that's true?

30:33.749 --> 30:35.983
- Yes, Chef.
- Okay.

30:36.017 --> 30:38.754
Still, you've been
here a while.

30:38.787 --> 30:40.521
Long enough to know
the lay of the land,

30:40.555 --> 30:42.591
understand what Keith did
for me day-in, day-out,

30:42.624 --> 30:45.361
the full extent of his duties.

30:45.394 --> 30:46.561
Yes, Chef.

30:46.595 --> 30:47.829
Good.
And...

30:47.863 --> 30:49.731
what do you have to say?

30:49.765 --> 30:51.600
Do you think you
can handle all that?

30:51.633 --> 30:53.568
- Yes, Chef.
- Dah...

30:53.602 --> 30:56.071
Okay.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.508
You gotta cut that shit out.

30:59.540 --> 31:00.908
Cut what out, Chef?

31:00.942 --> 31:02.377
You know what you're doing.

31:02.411 --> 31:03.778
You can't just...

31:03.811 --> 31:06.013
automatically "Yes, Chef"
me to death,

31:06.047 --> 31:08.549
like some fuckin'
deferential fuckin' parrot.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.753
This is important.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.587
You have to think
before you speak,

31:12.621 --> 31:14.757
and consider your answer.

31:14.789 --> 31:18.394
If you overstate your capacities
or exaggerate your competence,

31:18.426 --> 31:20.428
I am gonna find out
so fucking fast,

31:20.461 --> 31:21.797
and I'm gonna have
to shit-can you too.

31:21.829 --> 31:24.532
So I'm gonna ask you again.

31:24.566 --> 31:27.870
Last time, okay?
So, fuckin'...

31:27.903 --> 31:30.105
answer me honestly.

31:30.137 --> 31:32.774
Be straight.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.877
Is this a job you
think you can do?

31:39.079 --> 31:40.816
- Yes, Chef.
- Fuck!

31:40.848 --> 31:42.683
Okay...

31:42.717 --> 31:44.086
Mm...

31:44.118 --> 31:46.788
Now, ah...
Yeah, alright.

31:46.821 --> 31:50.658
Fair enough.

32:02.871 --> 32:04.640
This is a mess.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.775
You need to clean
this up right now.

32:25.993 --> 32:27.795
Hm...
That done yet?

32:27.828 --> 32:29.498
No, um...

32:29.530 --> 32:32.667
Give me a sec, I... I got
sidetracked there for a bit.

32:32.701 --> 32:36.637
So I take it things are
working out okay with Angela.

32:36.671 --> 32:39.074
- So far, so good.
- Told you she's good.

32:39.106 --> 32:41.108
That's not what I said.
I said, "So far, so good," okay?

32:41.142 --> 32:42.544
Jury's still out.

32:42.576 --> 32:43.778
Let's see how
she handles the rush.

32:43.811 --> 32:45.246
Okay.

32:45.279 --> 32:46.914
And you're welcome,
by the way.

32:46.948 --> 32:48.617
I'm sorry.

32:48.650 --> 32:50.886
Are you suggesting I should be
thanking you for some reason?

32:50.919 --> 32:52.488
Well, yeah,
of course you should.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.588
I mean, I recommended
her, didn't I?

32:53.622 --> 32:54.856
I hired her.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.259
No, I think
Keith hired her,

32:57.291 --> 32:59.827
and you never would have even
considered her to fill his shoes

32:59.861 --> 33:01.196
without my prompting.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.198
Oh, right, 'cause
I'm a sexist boss again.

33:03.230 --> 33:04.799
- Is that it?
- I didn't say that.

33:04.833 --> 33:07.702
Yeah, no, you just
implied it, as per usual.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.771
Okay, well, you have
to admit that sometimes

33:09.804 --> 33:11.640
you are a little
slow to recognize

33:11.673 --> 33:13.842
a woman's abilities
and contributions.

33:13.875 --> 33:17.546
And don't roll your eyes at me,
'cause it's totally true.

33:17.578 --> 33:19.114
Ah, what are you
angling for, Chloe?

33:19.146 --> 33:20.848
Because I guarantee calling me
a male chauvinist pig

33:20.882 --> 33:22.017
is not the best way
to go about getting it.

33:22.049 --> 33:24.118
Now that you mention it,
a little acknowledgement

33:24.152 --> 33:26.587
every once in a while
would be kind of gratifying.

33:26.621 --> 33:28.857
Oh, you want credit?
I can give you credit.

33:28.890 --> 33:30.592
I was in a bit
of a pickle there,

33:30.625 --> 33:31.993
and you came up with
an effective solution,

33:32.027 --> 33:33.194
however provisional.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.130
Bravo, well done.
Way to think on your feet.

33:35.163 --> 33:36.731
Keep up the good work.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.267
Wow.

33:38.299 --> 33:41.235
You really know how to make
a girl feel special, don't you?

33:41.269 --> 33:42.738
I just gave
you your due, Chloe.

33:42.770 --> 33:43.971
What more do you want?

33:44.005 --> 33:46.575
Actually,
I have a lot of great ideas

33:46.607 --> 33:48.609
that I think would be
really beneficial around here,

33:48.643 --> 33:51.212
so you might just want to start
listening to me more often.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.681
Okay, now
you're pushing your luck.

33:52.713 --> 33:54.048
Can we just get
through this evening

33:54.082 --> 33:57.553
without any more mishaps?
Please.

33:57.586 --> 33:59.153
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:59.186 --> 34:02.857
No...
No, no, no.

34:02.891 --> 34:04.326
Oh, oh, oh!

34:04.358 --> 34:06.060
What are you doing, what are
you doing, what are you doing?

34:06.094 --> 34:07.296
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

34:07.328 --> 34:08.230
- I have my conference, remember?
- What?

34:08.263 --> 34:09.197
We talked
about it weeks ago.

34:09.230 --> 34:10.797
You agreed to look
after him this afternoon.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.199
But that's today?

34:12.232 --> 34:13.701
Well, yes,
that's today!

34:13.734 --> 34:14.835
Saturday.
I'm presenting my paper!

34:14.868 --> 34:16.070
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

34:16.103 --> 34:17.338
- Hey!
- Hey, little man!

34:17.371 --> 34:19.041
- How you doing?
- Hi, Dad.

34:19.074 --> 34:20.308
Good, how are you?
Can you do me a favour?

34:20.342 --> 34:23.178
Can you just pop back inside the
car for like one more minute?

34:23.210 --> 34:24.813
How come?

34:24.846 --> 34:27.014
Just, like, one more,
because I just need to finish

34:27.047 --> 34:28.815
a conversation with Mommy, okay?

34:32.085 --> 34:34.121
Mais
tu es incroyable, tu sais?

34:34.155 --> 34:35.891
Please, please, this is a
very bad... it's not a good day.

34:35.922 --> 34:37.960
It's never
a good day for you, Daniel.

34:37.992 --> 34:40.228
This is a <i>really</i> bad day.
I am deep in the weeds today.

34:40.260 --> 34:41.262
In the weeds.

34:41.295 --> 34:43.664
That's what you always say!
It's a big cliche!

34:43.697 --> 34:45.733
It's a cliche for a reason.
It's a cliche 'cause it's true.

34:45.766 --> 34:46.867
Wait,
that's a cliche too!

34:46.902 --> 34:49.838
Look, I'm saying this
is a particularly bad day.

34:49.871 --> 34:51.840
Keith bailed on me.

34:51.873 --> 34:53.239
- Keith quit?
- Yes.

34:53.273 --> 34:54.342
Mais vraiment?

34:54.376 --> 34:55.777
I mean,
technically I fired him.

34:55.809 --> 34:57.311
But it was because
he was gonna bail on me!

34:57.344 --> 34:58.913
I had no choice!
He was gonna leave me

34:58.947 --> 34:59.815
for another restaurant!
I obviously didn't want

34:59.847 --> 35:01.315
to fire him.
Plus, Sid has got my balls

35:01.349 --> 35:02.350
in a vice,
and he's cranking 'em.

35:02.384 --> 35:04.318
- He's cranking on my nuts!
- Okay, okay!

35:04.351 --> 35:07.154
I get it, I don't need
to hear more about your balls!

35:07.188 --> 35:08.356
Look, all I'm saying
is these aren't

35:08.389 --> 35:10.092
garden-variety weeds.

35:10.125 --> 35:13.061
These are like big, bad, Day
of the Triffids mother-fuckers.

35:13.094 --> 35:14.630
I know that's not...
you don't know what that is,

35:14.663 --> 35:15.764
but like, they're... it's...

35:15.797 --> 35:17.699
I don't
ask you for much.

35:17.731 --> 35:20.835
You promised me this time.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.137
I can't do it.

35:22.170 --> 35:23.137
I can't do it.
Look at me.

35:23.170 --> 35:24.873
I can't do it, I can't do it,
I can't do it.

35:24.905 --> 35:28.076
I'm so sorry.
Please, please mercy, please.

35:28.108 --> 35:30.679
Mercy?

35:30.711 --> 35:33.047
Oh mon dieu.

35:33.081 --> 35:36.751
But this isn't a punishment.

35:36.784 --> 35:38.185
He's your son.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.690
You should want to
spend time with him.

35:41.722 --> 35:44.058
I know.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.830
I wasn't going to
get into this with you, but...

35:49.864 --> 35:51.800
What?

35:51.833 --> 35:52.768
I need to
tell you something,

35:52.800 --> 35:54.802
but I don't want to do it
with Jonah around.

35:54.835 --> 35:57.271
What are we doing?
What, what, what?

35:57.304 --> 35:59.407
Okay, I don't want
you to fly off the handle.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.209
You assume I'm gonna
fly off the handle?

36:02.242 --> 36:03.378
You're marrying that Ted guy?

36:03.411 --> 36:05.280
He is a loser.
Marianne, he's a loser.

36:05.313 --> 36:07.015
What?
No.

36:07.047 --> 36:08.949
We broke up, actually.

36:08.983 --> 36:12.287
Oh.
Sorry to hear that.

36:13.722 --> 36:15.924
Okay, tell me
the shitty thing already.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.259
Look...

36:17.291 --> 36:20.161
This isn't easy
for me to say, but...

36:21.862 --> 36:25.433
I am moving back
home with Jonah.

36:25.467 --> 36:26.934
What, back to Paris?

36:26.967 --> 36:28.269
Yes, back to Paris!

36:28.302 --> 36:30.038
Of course!

36:33.108 --> 36:35.777
Why would you do that?
You can't...

36:35.809 --> 36:37.778
Your whole life is here.
His whole life is here.

36:37.811 --> 36:39.012
He's got friends in school.

36:39.047 --> 36:41.983
You know how disruptive it's
gonna be for a kid like that?

36:42.016 --> 36:43.719
You're just gonna uproot him?
Why would you do that?

36:43.751 --> 36:46.054
Because I
need help, Daniel!

36:46.086 --> 36:48.155
I need more support.

36:48.188 --> 36:49.356
Okay.

36:49.389 --> 36:51.992
I know I haven't provided for...

36:52.025 --> 36:53.928
Come on, you can't
be this hard up.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.297
I mean, there must be plenty
left in that settlement.

36:55.329 --> 36:57.498
I'm not
talking about the money.

36:57.532 --> 37:01.001
I need a support system.

37:01.034 --> 37:03.904
My parents are there,
my whole family.

37:05.773 --> 37:10.011
Just, I need people
that I can count on.

37:49.918 --> 37:51.318
Ray, what's
the story, buddy?

37:51.351 --> 37:53.054
I thought you said we were
gonna get these cases today.

37:53.086 --> 37:54.188
Like I told Steven,

37:54.222 --> 37:56.391
yeah, I can get them to you,
but I'm gonna need COD.

37:56.423 --> 37:59.094
Oh, fuckin' COD.
What happened to net 60?

37:59.126 --> 38:00.895
Come on, Daniel,
your account's way overdue.

38:00.929 --> 38:02.497
I can't just
invoice you anymore.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.800
How long we been
in business together, man?

38:04.833 --> 38:06.934
- Nine.
- Like nine years, right?

38:06.967 --> 38:08.269
And all of a sudden
you don't trust me?

38:08.302 --> 38:09.938
Like, all of a sudden
my word's no good?

38:09.971 --> 38:11.039
It's got nothing
to do with that.

38:11.072 --> 38:12.173
It's not personal.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.275
Don't say
it's business, man.

38:13.307 --> 38:14.509
Don't, don't.

38:14.541 --> 38:16.577
But it is.
That's exactly what it is.

38:16.610 --> 38:18.112
That's...
Aah!

38:18.146 --> 38:19.948
It's... you're lying.
It's bullshit.

38:19.981 --> 38:22.184
It's personal because
you're still pissed

38:22.217 --> 38:24.820
about how I wouldn't go in for
that pay-for-play on the lane

38:24.853 --> 38:26.354
- with that plonk.
- That's not true.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.456
You've always been free to order
whatever you want from me

38:28.489 --> 38:31.025
- or not, no strings attached.
- Mm, yeah.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.327
For me to order it... you're just
not gonna fuckin' deliver it.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.529
I've let you coast on
credit before, but I'm sorry,

38:35.563 --> 38:37.566
I talked to Chuck and we
just can't do it anymore.

38:37.599 --> 38:39.501
This was a rush job.
The driver's pulling OT.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.436
I've gone out of my way
for you already.

38:41.469 --> 38:44.005
Yup, and I, uh...
I appreciate you, buddy.

38:44.038 --> 38:46.240
I just... so here's what...
here's what I'm gonna do.

38:46.273 --> 38:47.474
I'm gonna cut you
a big, fat cheque on Monday.

38:47.507 --> 38:49.009
That's not good enough.

38:49.043 --> 38:50.545
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna messenger it

38:50.577 --> 38:52.047
first thing in the morning.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.581
I just told you
I can't do it.

38:53.614 --> 38:55.449
It's COD or no-go.

38:55.483 --> 38:56.952
Fuck, you are
killing me, man.

38:56.985 --> 38:58.954
You know how badly
I need this shit,

38:58.987 --> 39:00.188
and you've got me over a barrel.

39:00.221 --> 39:01.489
Is that it?

39:01.521 --> 39:03.290
What's it gonna be, Dan?

39:03.324 --> 39:07.528
Tick-tock.

39:07.561 --> 39:10.565
Did you just
fuckin' tick-tock me?

39:10.597 --> 39:13.434
Ray, you mother-fucker,
the deal is cancelled,

39:13.467 --> 39:15.402
and you can stick
that precious Pino

39:15.436 --> 39:19.173
up your fuckin' weaselly ass!

39:24.646 --> 39:27.315
I know.

39:27.347 --> 39:28.916
I'm just not gonna
be out-muscled

39:28.949 --> 39:33.355
by some fucking
wine-peddling pussy!

39:33.387 --> 39:35.257
No offence.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.590
None taken.

39:36.623 --> 39:37.992
You know I don't think
you're a pussy, man.

39:38.025 --> 39:39.360
No, I know, Dan.

39:39.393 --> 39:41.096
But we really
needed those cases.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.529
I know, I know!

39:42.563 --> 39:44.132
Just...
Look, look.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.532
It's back there,
I know it is.

39:45.565 --> 39:47.601
Just dig deep.
Dig deep back there.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.271
We have it.
We just need it for tonight.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.006
Something, anything.

39:51.039 --> 39:52.173
Go back there, please, please.

39:52.206 --> 39:55.644
You got this?
You got this?

39:55.677 --> 39:57.445
- Yes.
- Great.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.481
Okay.

39:59.514 --> 40:01.416
Voila!

40:01.449 --> 40:03.184
This is the final draft?

40:03.217 --> 40:04.686
Yeah, you know
I can't promise that.

40:04.719 --> 40:06.487
Yeah, fair enough.

40:06.521 --> 40:08.556
Um, so, FYI, these
douchebags have been parked

40:08.588 --> 40:09.422
across the street all day.

40:09.456 --> 40:11.159
They just can't
camp out like that.

40:11.192 --> 40:12.661
Um, like what?

40:12.693 --> 40:14.695
Well, they're just...
they're just squatting.

40:14.728 --> 40:16.196
They're taking up
multiple spots.

40:16.230 --> 40:18.099
That's not kosher.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.135
So, what do you
want me to do about it?

40:20.168 --> 40:22.971
Maybe call the cops
or something, I don't know.

40:23.003 --> 40:25.105
Sure, I'll call 911,

40:25.139 --> 40:27.309
'cause this definitely
qualifies as an emergency.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.110
Call the parking
enforcement.

40:29.143 --> 40:31.579
There's gotta be like a snitch
line for shit like this.

40:31.612 --> 40:32.780
It's not legal
what they're doing!

40:32.813 --> 40:34.615
They're all the way
on the other side of the street.

40:34.648 --> 40:36.250
It's really bothering
you that much?

40:36.284 --> 40:37.619
Yes, it's really
bothering me that much.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.288
Can you please take care of it?

40:41.054 --> 40:42.389
We've already found
enough for tonight, Dan.

40:42.422 --> 40:43.991
This isn't really necessary.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.260
I'm telling you there's
one back here somewhere.

40:45.293 --> 40:49.030
You know, I don't recall
off-hand seeing an '05 Grand Cru

40:49.063 --> 40:51.132
just lying around before.

40:51.164 --> 40:53.601
Positive you didn't
drink it already?

40:53.634 --> 40:56.471
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'd remember polishing that off.

40:56.503 --> 40:58.739
Wait, wait,
wait a second...

40:58.773 --> 41:02.544
What do we have... here?

41:02.577 --> 41:03.678
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:03.710 --> 41:04.979
That's it, that's it.

41:05.012 --> 41:07.348
Ah, there she is.
I knew we had one.

41:07.382 --> 41:10.184
That's a rare item.
How'd you get your hands on it?

41:10.217 --> 41:13.554
I got a case when I was
in France on my honeymoon.

41:13.588 --> 41:15.590
A long time ago.

41:15.623 --> 41:17.157
You could probably get
a small fortune for it now.

41:17.190 --> 41:18.759
Maybe.

41:18.793 --> 41:20.428
But we're gonna cop it.

41:20.460 --> 41:21.663
And you're gonna pour it
with the pork belly

41:21.695 --> 41:23.331
for the VIP table.

41:23.364 --> 41:24.632
Are you sure?

41:24.666 --> 41:28.036
I mean, it seems like a shame
to just give it away like that.

41:28.068 --> 41:30.739
I mean, the wine's still
got great aging potential,

41:30.771 --> 41:33.741
and you could definitely keep
it solid for a while longer.

41:33.775 --> 41:38.079
Maybe even till Jonah's
old enough to appreciate it.

41:38.112 --> 41:40.648
No, I need it.

41:40.681 --> 41:42.650
I gotta dazzle some assholes.

41:42.682 --> 41:44.351
Okay, you're the boss.

41:44.385 --> 41:45.553
Alright, we're done!

41:45.585 --> 41:48.689
Actually, Dan, I've
been meaning to talk to you.

41:48.722 --> 41:50.358
Why?
What are you gonna say?

41:50.391 --> 41:52.327
I don't want to talk anymore
about this Ray business, okay?

41:52.360 --> 41:53.428
There's nothing more
to say about the guy.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.195
He's an ungrateful sack of shit.

41:55.228 --> 41:59.099
Yeah, but the thing is,
it's not just him.

41:59.132 --> 42:01.735
I've been getting a lot of
pushback from vendors lately.

42:01.768 --> 42:04.338
They're refusing to re-up
until we get current.

42:04.371 --> 42:07.775
Look...

42:07.809 --> 42:10.278
I'm doing what I can.

42:10.311 --> 42:12.447
Sure, of course.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.215
But in the meantime,
the list keeps shrinking.

42:15.248 --> 42:18.352
A lot of stuff is out
of stock, and you know,

42:18.385 --> 42:20.355
it never looks good when
people try to order something

42:20.387 --> 42:21.523
we don't even carry anymore.

42:21.556 --> 42:22.791
So revise the list!

42:22.824 --> 42:25.092
Revise the fucking list.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.295
Call it a conscious
curatorial decision.

42:27.327 --> 42:28.530
"Tighter selection."

42:28.563 --> 42:29.664
"Short, but well-edited."

42:29.697 --> 42:30.798
"Menu-driven as always."

42:30.831 --> 42:32.299
Come on, man.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.402
- Daniel...
- What?

42:36.204 --> 42:38.573
I hate to bring this up,

42:38.606 --> 42:41.109
but there's also a fair amount

42:41.141 --> 42:44.344
of inventory that's just...

42:44.378 --> 42:48.516
missing.

42:48.548 --> 42:52.119
You think one of your
guys has sticky fingers?

42:52.152 --> 42:55.322
Honestly, no,
I don't think that's it.

43:00.293 --> 43:02.530
Something you want
to say to me, Steven?

43:05.666 --> 43:06.768
- No.
- Good.

43:06.800 --> 43:07.835
- So we're done.
- Yeah, we're done.

43:07.869 --> 43:08.804
Great!

43:08.836 --> 43:10.338
Except how
do you want me to account

43:10.371 --> 43:11.606
for the discrepancies?

43:11.639 --> 43:12.707
Are you fucking
kidding me, man?

43:12.739 --> 43:14.542
Breakage and spillage!

43:19.614 --> 43:20.815
What the fuck?

43:20.847 --> 43:22.416
These truck guys
are still out here?

43:22.449 --> 43:24.751
Uh, yeah,
I called the dispatch centre

43:24.784 --> 43:27.454
and reported them, but I mean,
what more do you want me to do?

43:27.487 --> 43:28.856
Tell them myself?

43:28.889 --> 43:30.458
- The chutzpah on these guys.
- Ah...

43:30.490 --> 43:32.559
Fucking generation.

43:32.592 --> 43:34.628
What happened to paying
your dues, right?

43:34.661 --> 43:37.498
Kids these days.

43:37.532 --> 43:38.800
I...
Are you joking?

43:38.833 --> 43:40.501
I'm not joking.
This is not a joke.

43:40.534 --> 43:42.870
Okay.
Sorry, you're absolutely right.

43:42.903 --> 43:44.639
Millennials really
are the worst.

43:44.672 --> 43:47.442
When I was starting out,
we apprenticed ourselves.

43:47.474 --> 43:48.576
Oh.

43:48.608 --> 43:49.677
Yeah,
we fucking sacrificed,

43:49.710 --> 43:51.746
and we worked our way up,
and we earned our stripes.

43:51.778 --> 43:54.449
We didn't just hang up a shingle
and then start selling

43:54.481 --> 43:56.817
novelty snacks, and then
get hailed the next big thing.

43:56.851 --> 43:58.553
Okay, I'm pretty sure

43:58.585 --> 44:01.555
those guys went
to culinary school.

44:01.588 --> 44:04.491
That's not...
culinary school is coddling.

44:04.525 --> 44:06.528
It's like...
eeh...

44:06.561 --> 44:07.829
It's like fucking kindergarten.

44:07.862 --> 44:09.731
I'm talking about
being on the front lines

44:09.764 --> 44:12.400
and feeling the heat,
and being in the trenches

44:12.432 --> 44:13.835
with your back up
against the wall.

44:13.867 --> 44:15.836
Okay.
Okay, Dan, whatever you say.

44:15.869 --> 44:18.472
Uh, I'm gonna go
get ready for service.

45:01.748 --> 45:03.217
You got this.

45:03.251 --> 45:05.320
I got it.

45:05.353 --> 45:07.621
You got this?
I got this.

45:07.655 --> 45:09.524
You got this?
I got it.

45:09.556 --> 45:10.857
You got this?
I got it.

45:10.891 --> 45:12.693
You got this?
I got it.

45:12.726 --> 45:14.561
You got this?
I got it.

45:14.594 --> 45:15.996
You got this?
I got it!

45:16.030 --> 45:17.699
You got this?
I got it.

45:17.731 --> 45:18.967
I got this.
I got it.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.601
You got it?
I got it.

45:20.635 --> 45:21.736
You got this?
I got it!

45:21.768 --> 45:22.736
You got this?
I got it!

45:22.769 --> 45:23.771
You got this?
I got it!

45:23.804 --> 45:25.740
I got it!
I got it!

45:25.773 --> 45:27.709
I got this, I got this,
I got this...

45:27.742 --> 45:29.611
You in there, Dan?

45:29.643 --> 45:31.445
What?
Yeah, what is it?

45:31.478 --> 45:33.413
There's something I think
you should take a look at.

45:33.447 --> 45:34.649
Just give me a minute.

45:34.681 --> 45:35.817
Alright,
can I just come in?

45:35.849 --> 45:37.284
Yeah, just a sec.
Just a sec.

45:37.318 --> 45:38.519
- Hey, what the fuck?!
- What?

45:38.552 --> 45:40.555
- The door was unlocked!
- I'm changing!

45:40.588 --> 45:42.490
Okay, it is nothing
I haven't seen before.

45:42.523 --> 45:43.658
And besides,
you're fully dressed.

45:43.690 --> 45:46.493
Look, I am in the middle
of my pre-game routine.

45:46.527 --> 45:47.862
It is sacred to me.

45:47.894 --> 45:50.498
I need to be laser-focused
and fully present.

45:50.530 --> 45:52.933
That means no distractions.

45:52.967 --> 45:54.568
Besides, you know
how superstitious I am

45:54.601 --> 45:56.336
about my rituals!

45:56.369 --> 45:58.672
Okay, uh, well, I think
you're gonna want to take a look

45:58.706 --> 46:00.275
- at this anyway.
- I don't.

46:00.307 --> 46:01.576
Well, what is it?

46:01.608 --> 46:03.710
It's a story about
Keith and Insatiable.

46:03.744 --> 46:05.646
If it's about Keith,
what's it got to do with me?

46:05.679 --> 46:07.414
Well, maybe you should
just read it for yourself.

46:07.447 --> 46:09.616
I am not
fucking reading that.

46:09.650 --> 46:11.918
Summarize it for me.

46:11.952 --> 46:14.455
Well, uh, there were
some relatively unflattering

46:14.487 --> 46:15.889
- statements made about you.
- By Keith?

46:15.922 --> 46:17.791
No, not by Keith.

46:17.824 --> 46:19.760
Fuck, why are you telling
me this shit right now, Chloe?

46:19.793 --> 46:22.864
I am telling you because
the last time you thought

46:22.896 --> 46:24.599
I was holding out on you,
you got so mad at me.

46:24.632 --> 46:26.501
Like, I didn't want
you to feel blindsided

46:26.534 --> 46:28.469
if you stumbled across this or
if somebody else brought it up.

46:28.501 --> 46:29.469
This is different.
This is a fucking blog.

46:29.503 --> 46:30.972
Nobody gives a shit what
this bitch has to say.

46:31.005 --> 46:32.773
Uh, actually,
it was other chefs

46:32.806 --> 46:34.375
talking shit about you.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.711
Well, is that so surprising?

46:37.744 --> 46:39.480
I mean, I've stepped on
a lot of toes over the years.

46:39.512 --> 46:40.815
Of course there's gonna
be some hacks out there

46:40.847 --> 46:41.916
who want to bad-mouth me.

46:41.949 --> 46:42.916
I don't care what
they have to say.

46:42.949 --> 46:46.053
I don't care.
They can all go fuck themselves.

46:46.086 --> 46:47.989
Okay.
Good.

46:48.021 --> 46:50.625
So you're saying
this is not an issue?

46:50.657 --> 46:51.992
Yup.
Not an issue.

46:52.025 --> 46:54.861
It's a non-issue.

46:54.894 --> 46:56.864
- Okay.
- Great.

46:56.896 --> 46:59.500
Uh, wait a minute,
wait a minute, um...

46:59.532 --> 47:01.835
What?

47:01.869 --> 47:03.938
Close the door for a sec?

47:07.074 --> 47:08.476
Yeah?

47:08.509 --> 47:09.710
So, I got
a few minutes before

47:09.744 --> 47:12.713
I gotta address the troops,
and I was thinking that we...

47:12.746 --> 47:16.416
Mm-hm?
- ...could, um...

47:16.449 --> 47:18.985
What are the chances
I could get, like, a blowjob?

47:19.018 --> 47:20.554
Are you fucking joking?

47:20.588 --> 47:21.856
I am...

47:21.889 --> 47:23.557
always serious about fellatio.

47:23.590 --> 47:25.692
That is a subject that
is deadly serious for me.

47:28.061 --> 47:29.496
That was a joke.
That was a joke!

47:29.530 --> 47:30.765
That was... look at me.
I'm joking.

47:30.797 --> 47:32.500
Joking!

47:32.532 --> 47:34.568
But I am serious about the first
part about the blow job part.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.136
- That... that was earnest.
- Alright, Jesus, Dan.

47:36.170 --> 47:38.740
Calm... fuck, I'm...
I'm tense!

47:38.773 --> 47:40.375
You know?
I'm... I just need...

47:40.407 --> 47:41.675
And you brought
that article in here!

47:41.708 --> 47:42.643
I don't need
that shit right now.

47:42.675 --> 47:43.643
That's fucking my head up!

47:43.677 --> 47:45.012
I thought you said
it was a non-issue.

47:45.045 --> 47:46.813
And now I'm rattled.

47:46.847 --> 47:48.015
Come on, I just...

47:48.047 --> 47:50.984
I...
I need...

47:51.018 --> 47:54.054
I need a release, so...

47:54.088 --> 47:56.124
Un-fucking-believable.

47:56.157 --> 47:59.394
You know, you could have
gotten some release last night,

47:59.427 --> 48:00.894
but you stood me up, remember?

48:00.927 --> 48:02.763
And I apologized for that.

48:02.797 --> 48:04.865
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, you didn't.

48:04.898 --> 48:07.801
In fact, you made an explicit
point of not apologizing.

48:07.835 --> 48:10.037
And I'm making up
for that right now.

48:10.070 --> 48:11.338
By sexually harassing me.

48:11.371 --> 48:13.974
It's not sexual harassment
when you're in a relationship!

48:14.007 --> 48:17.043
Okay, first off,
I don't think that's true.

48:17.077 --> 48:18.946
And...

48:18.978 --> 48:21.515
Ooh, secondly,
it begs the question...

48:22.817 --> 48:25.753
Are we in a relationship, Dan?
Hm?

48:25.786 --> 48:28.054
Is that what... <i>this</i> is?

48:28.088 --> 48:30.992
Because it doesn't really feel
like a relationship to me.

48:31.025 --> 48:33.461
It feels like
I'm your employee.

48:33.494 --> 48:36.030
Your employee that you
order around and criticize

48:36.063 --> 48:37.731
and don't appreciate,

48:37.764 --> 48:40.532
and that you also happen
to fuck from time to time,

48:40.534 --> 48:43.771
but only when it's
convenient for you, of course.

48:43.804 --> 48:46.874
And so I'm thinking
that if that is the case,

48:46.907 --> 48:49.477
if that is the state
of affairs between us,

48:49.510 --> 48:51.512
then I should
probably just quit,

48:51.545 --> 48:54.682
because I am sick and tired of
being the whore on your payroll.

48:54.715 --> 48:55.917
No, Chloe, stop, stop!

48:55.949 --> 48:57.551
Look, please don't
walk out on me!

48:57.585 --> 48:59.220
Why?
Hm?

48:59.253 --> 49:01.655
Why not?
Give me one good reason.

49:01.688 --> 49:03.924
Because I need you.

49:03.958 --> 49:05.626
Okay.

49:05.659 --> 49:09.896
So you...
you <i>need</i> me, need me?

49:09.929 --> 49:12.000
Or you need me to work
the front desk tonight?

49:14.534 --> 49:15.702
Can't it be both?

49:15.735 --> 49:17.538
I mean, is it
mutually exclusive?

49:17.570 --> 49:18.773
- You are un-fucking...
- Okay, wait!

49:18.806 --> 49:19.706
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Okay!

49:19.740 --> 49:21.141
Just let me...
I need to say one thing.

49:21.175 --> 49:22.844
Haven't you said enough?

49:22.876 --> 49:25.712
This is a different thing.
Just... hear me out.

49:25.746 --> 49:26.981
Do I have a choice?

49:27.014 --> 49:28.483
I mean, yes,
you have a choice.

49:28.516 --> 49:29.784
I'm not gonna force
you to listen to me.

49:29.817 --> 49:31.619
Yet, you're
literally blocking the door

49:31.652 --> 49:33.019
with your body.

49:33.052 --> 49:34.688
Hm?

49:42.295 --> 49:43.964
Dah!
Yeah, okay.

49:43.998 --> 49:45.132
What?
What?

49:45.164 --> 49:46.701
Say what you have to say.

49:46.733 --> 49:48.235
Okay.

49:48.268 --> 49:50.203
You know that reservation you
were asking me about before?

49:50.237 --> 49:51.972
- Evans, party of four?
- Yeah, the VIP table?

49:52.005 --> 49:53.039
Right, the VIP table.

49:53.072 --> 49:54.674
Well, that is not just some

49:54.708 --> 49:56.143
asshole I need to
bend over backwards for.

49:56.175 --> 49:57.844
I've known that guy
since forever,

49:57.878 --> 49:59.814
and he is seriously considering
investing in the restaurant.

49:59.847 --> 50:01.916
What do you mean,
investing?

50:01.949 --> 50:03.550
I mean, giving me money.

50:03.583 --> 50:07.687
Money I really,
really need right now.

50:07.721 --> 50:09.856
Oh, for God's sake, Dan.
What did you do?

50:09.889 --> 50:10.991
What did I do?

50:11.025 --> 50:11.992
What does that mean,
"What did I do?"

50:12.025 --> 50:13.027
I didn't do anything!

50:13.061 --> 50:14.829
I'm just saying
the restaurant is in the red,

50:14.862 --> 50:16.864
and it has been for
a really long time.

50:16.896 --> 50:19.065
No, we've been
consistently busy.

50:19.099 --> 50:20.701
I thought things
were going well.

50:20.733 --> 50:23.538
Well, not well enough.

50:23.570 --> 50:24.838
What do you want me to say?

50:24.871 --> 50:26.706
It's a tough business
even at the best of times.

50:26.739 --> 50:28.108
I'm just...

50:28.141 --> 50:30.644
I have been covering
the losses for over a year,

50:30.677 --> 50:31.878
and I'm tapped out.

50:31.911 --> 50:34.014
I can't make up
the shortfall anymore.

50:34.047 --> 50:37.217
I'm gonna have to close the
doors unless I get an infusion

50:37.251 --> 50:40.788
of cash, and I'm talking
about a significant infusion.

50:42.956 --> 50:45.592
Yeah.
Now you know.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.328
Now you know why
tonight is so important,

50:47.360 --> 50:49.829
and why I don't
want you to leave.

50:49.862 --> 50:53.333
Why I'm begging you to stay.

50:53.367 --> 50:56.003
Please, Chlo...

50:56.036 --> 50:59.807
I need you.

51:04.911 --> 51:06.580
Now, I shouldn't have
to remind you of this,

51:06.614 --> 51:09.817
but apparently you're slipping
up again, so let me stress,

51:09.849 --> 51:13.286
for the umpteenth time,
how important it is you do not

51:13.320 --> 51:17.858
elaborate on, or add to,
any of these descriptions.

51:17.891 --> 51:21.695
They are minimal
and oblique on purpose.

51:21.728 --> 51:25.165
They are meant to be suggestive
and reflect an air of mystery,

51:25.199 --> 51:29.170
so please respect that
and refrain from the urge

51:29.202 --> 51:33.206
to improvise or interpret,
or otherwise comment on,

51:33.239 --> 51:35.175
what is written here.

51:35.208 --> 51:39.012
Is that clear?

51:39.045 --> 51:41.381
Now, if someone asks you
directly for your...

51:45.418 --> 51:47.087
Here we go.
Fire two soups!

51:47.121 --> 51:50.124
Yes, Chef!

52:01.735 --> 52:03.403
Fire four salads!

52:03.436 --> 52:05.405
Fire two soups, two salads!

52:05.438 --> 52:07.107
Yes, Chef.

52:07.141 --> 52:09.175
Fire four veg,
fire two meat!

52:09.208 --> 52:10.911
Yes, Chef.

52:10.943 --> 52:13.847
- Fire two soups!
- Yes, Chef.

52:16.449 --> 52:17.784
Fire two soups!

52:17.818 --> 52:19.754
Yes, Chef.

52:19.786 --> 52:21.321
Fire two sweet!

52:21.355 --> 52:24.291
Yes, Chef.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.895
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

52:28.929 --> 52:32.233
Uh, I got a reservation
for four at 8 pm, Evans.

52:32.266 --> 52:33.300
Mark Evans.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.934
Ah, yeah, Mr. Evans,

52:34.967 --> 52:36.803
we have you in
the private dining area.

52:36.836 --> 52:39.407
If you just follow me
through here.

53:14.242 --> 53:16.944
- Oh, Mark, good to see you.
- Yeah, you too, you too.

53:16.976 --> 53:18.812
- You remember my wife, Adley?
- Of course.

53:18.846 --> 53:20.847
And this is one of
my partners, Eugene Barnes.

53:20.880 --> 53:22.348
Great.
Well, welcome.

53:22.382 --> 53:23.784
Thank you so much for coming.

53:23.817 --> 53:26.052
Glad you could
all join us tonight.

53:26.085 --> 53:28.321
Normally I would let one of
my staff give the opening spiel,

53:28.355 --> 53:31.826
but I wanted to come up myself,
greet all of you,

53:31.858 --> 53:33.226
make sure you were
comfortable and settled in

53:33.260 --> 53:36.430
before we kick this thing off.

53:36.463 --> 53:37.965
- Okay, I think we're good.
- Yes?

53:37.998 --> 53:39.500
Okay.
Alright, great.

53:39.532 --> 53:40.967
Well, let me get right to it.

53:41.001 --> 53:43.771
The menu tonight,
it consist of seven courses,

53:43.804 --> 53:46.507
each accompanied
by a wine pairing.

53:46.539 --> 53:50.411
I'm usually wary of extended
storytelling metaphors,

53:50.443 --> 53:52.278
but if you are so inclined,

53:52.311 --> 53:54.248
you could imagine
that each course

53:54.280 --> 53:57.317
is an episode or a chapter.

53:57.351 --> 53:59.487
The dishes have standalone
integrity, of course,

53:59.519 --> 54:04.425
but there is a cohesiveness
and a progression to the menu,

54:04.458 --> 54:06.260
the proverbial whole
amounting to more than

54:06.293 --> 54:08.195
the sum of its parts.

54:09.797 --> 54:11.298
Okay, well...

54:11.331 --> 54:13.267
Now that we're started,
we're settled in,

54:13.300 --> 54:15.302
we can get you going
with an amuse,

54:15.335 --> 54:17.871
and that should
whet your appetites

54:17.905 --> 54:20.107
and complement the fine
growers' champagne

54:20.139 --> 54:24.043
that my sommelier Steven
has kindly provided.

54:24.077 --> 54:27.148
And that's it.
Bon appetit.

54:27.181 --> 54:28.816
Alright, cheers to that.

54:41.094 --> 54:42.463
I want to
double-fire on table 12.

54:42.496 --> 54:43.564
You bring every dish
to me personally.

54:43.597 --> 54:45.199
Yes, Chef.

54:45.231 --> 54:46.934
- Um...
- What's wrong?

54:46.967 --> 54:49.436
I wouldn't say anything
is necessarily wrong, per se...

54:49.469 --> 54:50.804
I know
something's fucked up.

54:50.838 --> 54:52.239
What are you doing back here?

54:52.271 --> 54:53.072
There's just
a little wrinkle you should

54:53.106 --> 54:54.408
- probably be aware of.
- Hands.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.076
What?

54:56.108 --> 54:57.443
Beth Childres is sitting
at one of the high-tops.

54:57.476 --> 54:58.878
Who is that?

54:58.911 --> 55:00.480
Beth Childres.
You know, the blogger.

55:00.514 --> 55:02.182
Oh, for...
How do you know it's her?

55:02.215 --> 55:03.150
Uh, it's her, alright.

55:03.184 --> 55:05.486
She's not one of these
anonymous reviewers.

55:05.518 --> 55:06.453
She's more like
the opposite of that.

55:06.487 --> 55:07.922
Everybody knows what
she looks like, so...

55:07.954 --> 55:09.190
What does she want?

55:09.222 --> 55:11.858
Beats me,
but apparently not just a drink.

55:11.891 --> 55:13.893
She ordered
the full degustation.

55:13.927 --> 55:15.329
Hands!

55:15.362 --> 55:16.530
Table six.

55:16.563 --> 55:18.398
Thank you.

55:22.603 --> 55:24.137
Okay.

55:24.170 --> 55:27.841
Uh, fire two meat,
fire four fish, fire two sweet!

55:27.875 --> 55:30.344
Yes, Chef!

55:40.286 --> 55:42.255
You got a lot of
nerve showing up here

55:42.289 --> 55:44.158
after what you wrote about me.

55:44.190 --> 55:45.859
So you do read
my blog after all?

55:45.893 --> 55:47.927
No, no, no.
Not a chance.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.329
Someone gave me the gist,

55:49.362 --> 55:52.131
and you repeatedly
mocked and insulted me.

55:52.164 --> 55:54.300
Well, that's
not quite accurate.

55:54.333 --> 55:56.971
I merely quoted other
professionals in the field

55:57.003 --> 55:59.172
expressing their
individual opinions,

55:59.206 --> 56:01.976
which don't necessarily
reflect my own point of view.

56:02.009 --> 56:04.311
That's barely a disclaimer.
It was a hit job, you know it.

56:04.344 --> 56:06.347
You basically called...
basically called me a has-been.

56:06.380 --> 56:07.481
But look around.

56:07.514 --> 56:08.916
Does this place seem
moribund to you?

56:08.949 --> 56:10.184
No, it does not.

56:10.217 --> 56:12.086
We are full up, and I am
operating at the height

56:12.119 --> 56:14.121
of my powers, right now.

56:14.153 --> 56:16.556
And I never
said otherwise.

56:16.590 --> 56:19.293
I just pointed out
that you are not part

56:19.326 --> 56:21.561
of the larger
conversation anymore.

56:21.594 --> 56:23.163
People aren't talking about you.

56:23.195 --> 56:26.467
You've...
you've lost your buzz.

56:33.507 --> 56:35.608
Buzz is bullshit.

56:35.641 --> 56:38.378
It's a made-up word
that doesn't fucking exist.

56:38.411 --> 56:42.315
It was invented by publicists
and marketing idiots

56:42.349 --> 56:44.351
and media people like you,

56:44.384 --> 56:46.452
who can all get in
on the same circle jerk.

56:46.485 --> 56:48.588
Well, I'm not like that,
I never have been,

56:48.621 --> 56:50.290
and I never will be.

56:52.259 --> 56:54.661
You're quite the contrarian,
aren't you?

56:54.695 --> 56:58.065
A real old-school rebel
playing by your own rules,

56:58.097 --> 56:59.933
proudly out-of-step
with the times.

56:59.967 --> 57:01.969
You think...
you think I'm posturing?

57:02.001 --> 57:04.137
You think this is just,
like, I'm striking a pose

57:04.170 --> 57:06.439
to be controversial?
Well, I'm not.

57:06.472 --> 57:08.474
It's just me.
This is me.

57:08.507 --> 57:10.576
I'm not some
cynical, opportunistic,

57:10.610 --> 57:13.347
pandering parasite,
like...

57:13.380 --> 57:15.282
you.

57:19.219 --> 57:22.021
Okay.
Daniel, I get it.

57:22.054 --> 57:25.591
And I certainly hope
that's working out for you,

57:25.625 --> 57:27.994
because at the end of the day,

57:28.027 --> 57:29.730
we all know what
happened to the dinosaurs,

57:29.762 --> 57:32.967
don't we?

57:39.539 --> 57:43.044
Wow.

57:48.148 --> 57:50.651
You have a great dinner,
Miss Childres.

58:22.782 --> 58:26.786
Hands, please.

58:31.757 --> 58:33.259
Thank you.

58:33.293 --> 58:35.796
Oh, my god.

58:44.503 --> 58:47.340
Good.

58:59.152 --> 59:01.155
Thank you.

59:09.862 --> 59:12.432
Thank you.

59:56.909 --> 59:58.811
Wait a minute,
no, no, no.

59:58.844 --> 01:00:00.880
No, no, no, no.

01:00:00.914 --> 01:00:02.583
No!

01:00:02.615 --> 01:00:07.521
Black, black.

01:00:07.554 --> 01:00:09.123
Re-fire two meats!

01:00:09.155 --> 01:00:11.157
Yes, Chef.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:12.458
I'm doing that.
I'm doing it.

01:00:12.492 --> 01:00:15.562
Out, out, out.

01:00:35.748 --> 01:00:39.318
Hands, please.

01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:41.355
Bearded guy gets
this one, okay?

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:45.558
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:00:45.592 --> 01:00:47.927
It's my pleasure
to tell you that the chef has

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.696
a special surprise to
accompany your next course.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:54.467
A wine pairing
exclusively for your table.

01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:57.271
He's reached deep into
his own personal cellar

01:00:57.304 --> 01:01:00.907
to find this rare
2005 Grand Cru

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.877
from one of the finest
domains in all of Burgundy.

01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:31.338
Thank you.

01:01:37.344 --> 01:01:38.845
How are we doing up there?

01:01:38.878 --> 01:01:40.713
Uh, I'd say they were...

01:01:40.746 --> 01:01:42.548
- suitably impressed.
- Good.

01:01:42.581 --> 01:01:44.617
Fucking-well better be.
That's a $2,000 bottle of wine.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:47.853
Oh, minimum.

01:01:47.887 --> 01:01:50.923
They, uh, wanted me
to have the last glass.

01:01:50.956 --> 01:01:53.326
Mm-hm?

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.728
How fuckin' magnanimous of them.

01:01:56.795 --> 01:01:59.599
It should really go to you.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:08.709
You should have it.

01:02:08.742 --> 01:02:11.345
You sure?

01:02:11.378 --> 01:02:12.846
I've had it before, so...

01:02:12.878 --> 01:02:14.847
Yeah, no, but I mean,
it's not the same wine

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.583
anymore, is it?

01:02:17.617 --> 01:02:19.786
It's matured into
something more...

01:02:19.818 --> 01:02:24.257
more complex, more nuanced.

01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:27.760
Ah.
It's all yours.

01:02:52.985 --> 01:02:55.288
- Oh, Jesus Christ, man!
- Hey.

01:02:55.322 --> 01:02:56.757
You just scared
the shit out of me.

01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:58.659
Ah, that's... I...
I saw you come down here,

01:02:58.692 --> 01:02:59.659
so I just wanted to, like...

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:01.528
Wanted to catch a peek,
before I zip up?

01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:02.929
- You sure?
- No, I just...

01:03:02.961 --> 01:03:04.797
I wanted to say, uh...

01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:05.999
Was it good?
Everything was good?

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.367
- Oh, it was fantastic.
- Great!

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.601
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:03:08.635 --> 01:03:10.671
Yeah, Eugene's wife's
been Instagramming every course.

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.005
- Love to hear it.
- Yeah.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.606
Great, so that's great.
Everything's great?

01:03:13.639 --> 01:03:14.940
Yeah.

01:03:14.974 --> 01:03:16.843
I mean, we're...
we're great?

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:20.614
Like, you and I are great?

01:03:20.646 --> 01:03:22.682
Oh, yeah.
Let's talk on Monday about that.

01:03:22.715 --> 01:03:25.818
Yeah, fuck Monday.

01:03:25.851 --> 01:03:27.353
'Cause we're...
I mean, we're here, right?

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.356
So...

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:32.059
You mean, you wanna
do it right this minute?

01:03:32.092 --> 01:03:34.427
While my wife's waiting
back at the table?

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.661
- I get it.
- Yeah.

01:03:35.695 --> 01:03:37.597
Obviously, I...

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.800
I can't really wait till Monday,
so you gotta tell me right now.

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:42.402
Are we gonna do this?

01:03:42.434 --> 01:03:46.472
Yeah?
Yes or no?

01:03:46.505 --> 01:03:47.773
Uh, it's not that simple.

01:03:47.806 --> 01:03:50.476
Mm.

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:51.845
No?

01:03:51.878 --> 01:03:53.547
It's not fuckin' rocket science.

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:54.648
Heh...
Yeah.

01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:55.816
I mean, look,
it's a great restaurant.

01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:57.684
Mm, great.
Yeah.

01:03:57.717 --> 01:03:59.353
You said that.
Back there, you said that once.

01:03:59.385 --> 01:04:00.619
And I mean it.
I mean it.

01:04:00.652 --> 01:04:02.488
The food is top-notch,
the experience,

01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:03.956
the whole speech off the top.

01:04:03.989 --> 01:04:06.492
You know, it feels very... I feel
very loved, taken care of.

01:04:06.525 --> 01:04:08.494
If you love it,
why does it feel like

01:04:08.527 --> 01:04:10.096
- you're backing out right now?
- I'm not, I'm not.

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:13.633
It's just, uh....

01:04:13.666 --> 01:04:16.036
The numbers don't add up,
is the problem.

01:04:17.536 --> 01:04:19.105
What?

01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:20.740
I know that's
the fuckin' problem.

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.608
That's why I'm talking to you!
You're the numbers guy.

01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:24.844
You're gonna...
I mean, right?

01:04:24.878 --> 01:04:27.881
But I cannot
magically fix the math.

01:04:27.914 --> 01:04:30.484
Even if I knew the precise way
that you could write this ship,

01:04:30.516 --> 01:04:32.118
you're not gonna listen to me!

01:04:32.152 --> 01:04:33.887
Come on, I would consider
everything you have to say.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.921
Yeah, you'd consider it.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:36.456
And then you'd go back
to doing things exactly

01:04:36.489 --> 01:04:37.724
the way you wanted to.

01:04:37.757 --> 01:04:39.393
That's exactly how you've
always done things.

01:04:39.425 --> 01:04:40.893
That's what makes this
restaurant so unique.

01:04:40.927 --> 01:04:42.729
So pure, if you will.

01:04:42.762 --> 01:04:45.532
But that also makes it virtually
impossible to turn a profit.

01:04:47.567 --> 01:04:50.503
It's not about a profit.
You're loaded, Ev.

01:04:50.536 --> 01:04:51.771
All your partners are loaded.

01:04:51.804 --> 01:04:52.905
That's not really...

01:04:52.938 --> 01:04:54.673
It could be
a clubhouse for you.

01:04:54.706 --> 01:04:56.576
You come in,
you could entertain.

01:04:56.608 --> 01:04:58.878
Clients or whatever.
You could get anything you want.

01:04:58.911 --> 01:05:00.980
You got somebody
you want to bring?

01:05:01.014 --> 01:05:03.083
Nobody, you know,
little side piece or whatever.

01:05:03.115 --> 01:05:05.184
I don't know!
Whatever you want.

01:05:05.217 --> 01:05:07.086
I'm just saying, this could be...
this is the perfect

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:08.422
fucking write-off for you.

01:05:09.755 --> 01:05:12.625
Yeah, except I'm not
looking for a write-off.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.095
My partners and I are looking
for a legitimate opportunity,

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:17.497
with a reasonable
expectation of a return.

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:18.732
This place is not that.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.168
I don't understand.

01:05:22.202 --> 01:05:24.971
Did you know that you were gonna
come here and say this to me?

01:05:25.003 --> 01:05:26.806
I mean, I jumped
through every hoop.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.941
- I was your dancing bear.
- No!

01:05:27.974 --> 01:05:28.975
I only came...
you invited me!

01:05:29.007 --> 01:05:30.143
Don't I treat you well?

01:05:30.175 --> 01:05:31.444
I hadn't been
here in a while...

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.481
I just brought people
whose opinions I respected,

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:35.782
and they love the place.
They're super-impressed!

01:05:35.815 --> 01:05:37.517
- Okay!
- Yeah, but that just

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.153
underscores the point that the
quality is not the issue here.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.254
- It never has been.
- That's what I'm saying!

01:05:41.286 --> 01:05:43.122
But the numbers
that you sent me, I'm sorry,

01:05:43.155 --> 01:05:44.924
but dollars and cents wise,
it makes no...

01:05:44.958 --> 01:05:46.593
Look, it's the bottom
line, right?

01:05:46.626 --> 01:05:47.861
That's why they call
it the bottom line.

01:05:47.893 --> 01:05:48.928
That's it.
That's all that matters.

01:05:48.961 --> 01:05:50.998
- Please.
- What?

01:05:52.498 --> 01:05:55.534
Please.

01:05:55.568 --> 01:05:58.638
I need you to do this thing.

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:01.040
You said it yourself,
the place is good.

01:06:01.074 --> 01:06:05.110
The place is good.
It needs your help.

01:06:05.143 --> 01:06:06.579
And you can give it.

01:06:06.612 --> 01:06:07.913
I mean, this is nothing for you,

01:06:07.947 --> 01:06:10.517
and you can be a part of
this thing that's good.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:11.885
Right?

01:06:11.918 --> 01:06:13.820
Okay, look, just stop,
please, okay?

01:06:13.853 --> 01:06:17.757
You're disappointed, I get it.
I'm sorry.

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:19.826
It doesn't matter if
I'm doing well or not,

01:06:19.858 --> 01:06:22.795
I'm not gonna throw
my money away on a whim.

01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:24.597
Alright?
I'm not gonna be your patron,

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.798
if that's what
you're hoping for.

01:06:25.831 --> 01:06:27.634
I'm not a Medici.

01:06:27.666 --> 01:06:30.903
Not for a guaranteed
losing proposition.

01:06:30.936 --> 01:06:32.972
This place is not
a sound investment.

01:06:33.005 --> 01:06:36.777
It's not financially viable
anymore, if it ever was.

01:06:38.978 --> 01:06:40.680
I can't believe
what you're doing.

01:06:40.713 --> 01:06:42.015
What?

01:06:42.047 --> 01:06:43.750
You're being
a shitty friend.

01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:45.551
You're guilt-tripping me?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:47.554
Is that supposed to work?
Okay, take all my money.

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:49.021
No, I'm just telling
you what you're doing.

01:06:49.054 --> 01:06:50.656
That's what...
okay, okay.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:51.791
You fucking had
a chance to save me,

01:06:51.824 --> 01:06:53.192
and you're gonna leave me...
you're gonna walk away?

01:06:53.226 --> 01:06:54.794
- Yeah.
- Shitty friend, Ev.

01:06:54.827 --> 01:06:55.962
- That's you.
- Alright, you know what?

01:06:55.994 --> 01:06:58.664
Can you just knock it off
with the calling me "Ev" shit,

01:06:58.697 --> 01:07:00.165
like we're deep
fucking best friends

01:07:00.199 --> 01:07:02.202
from way back in the day?

01:07:02.235 --> 01:07:04.070
Alright, we were
never that close.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.405
You realize that?

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:08.008
When you called me and asked me
for help, I was like, "Really?"

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:10.544
Wait, wait,
what are you talking about?

01:07:10.577 --> 01:07:11.811
Does that not
ring a bell to you?

01:07:11.844 --> 01:07:12.945
Quite honestly,
back in high school,

01:07:12.978 --> 01:07:15.214
you didn't really
treat me very well.

01:07:15.248 --> 01:07:19.686
I was... I was not
on your social level.

01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:23.289
That was 25 fuckin' years ago.

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:27.726
And you haven't
changed a bit.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.829
You're still so wrapped up
in your own little world

01:07:29.862 --> 01:07:32.097
that you don't realize
you're a pompous,

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:34.300
egotistical prick
who doesn't give a shit

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:37.570
about anybody but himself.

01:07:37.603 --> 01:07:40.306
So, no, I will not be
underwriting your petty fiefdom

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.876
moving forward.

01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:44.911
If I were you, I would
actually declare bankruptcy.

01:07:44.943 --> 01:07:46.813
You're not me.

01:07:46.846 --> 01:07:48.248
You should cut your losses

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.317
before you get
even worse in debt.

01:07:51.351 --> 01:07:53.853
And then maybe you take a good,
long look in the mirror,

01:07:53.885 --> 01:07:57.291
and figure out how to stop
being such a fucking asshole.

01:07:59.057 --> 01:08:01.193
You guys
have espresso, right?

01:08:01.226 --> 01:08:05.632
We'll take four.

01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:56.247
What are you doing out here?
We're in the middle of service.

01:08:56.282 --> 01:08:58.850
What the fuck
does it matter?

01:08:58.885 --> 01:08:59.853
Hey,
what is going on, Dan?

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.220
What happened?

01:09:01.252 --> 01:09:03.354
What do you
think happened, Chloe?

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:04.823
He passed.

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:09.763
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:10.930
Oh, Jesus!

01:09:10.962 --> 01:09:12.363
Ow!
God...

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:13.899
Oh my God.
Let me see, let me see.

01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:15.068
I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.167
No, you're not fine.
You're hurt.

01:09:16.202 --> 01:09:17.935
Just let me see your hand!
Just let me see... Dan...

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:19.904
I don't need
your fuckin' help!

01:10:09.488 --> 01:10:11.824
What's up, Chef?
Need a bite to eat?

01:10:11.858 --> 01:10:13.426
Heh...
No, no.

01:10:13.458 --> 01:10:16.028
I need for you to get the hell
outta here, that's what I need.

01:10:16.061 --> 01:10:18.131
- That's a good one.
- Yeah.

01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:20.032
- You're joking, right?
- No, no.

01:10:20.065 --> 01:10:22.935
You got your little block party.
Good for you.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:26.072
Sure you took a nice
Instagram of it or whatever,

01:10:26.104 --> 01:10:28.006
but it's time for you to pack up
your shit and get out of here.

01:10:28.039 --> 01:10:28.873
Nah, nah.

01:10:28.908 --> 01:10:30.276
We still got all
these peeps to serve.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.311
- Can't just leave 'em hanging.
- Okay.

01:10:32.345 --> 01:10:35.215
I think the peeps have been
served long enough, yeah?

01:10:35.247 --> 01:10:36.982
You've been parked
out here all day.

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:39.051
I get it, I do.

01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:41.253
I know what you're doing,
but like, it's bullshit.

01:10:41.287 --> 01:10:43.389
- It's not cool.
- Says who?

01:10:43.421 --> 01:10:44.757
I'm not breaking any laws.

01:10:44.791 --> 01:10:46.826
I got all the right
permits and shit.

01:10:46.859 --> 01:10:48.094
I asked you nicely.

01:10:48.127 --> 01:10:49.963
That was nice, okay?

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.998
And now I'm telling you,

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.768
if you don't pack your shit up
and get the fuck out of here...

01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:57.437
What?
What are you gonna do about it?

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.405
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

01:10:59.438 --> 01:11:02.509
Or maybe you just can't
handle a little competition.

01:11:02.542 --> 01:11:04.878
You think you're...
you're not my competition.

01:11:04.911 --> 01:11:06.412
You're not even a chef.

01:11:06.444 --> 01:11:08.914
You're a punk kid in a truck!

01:11:08.948 --> 01:11:10.115
Ah, it's gonna
be like that, huh?

01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:11.451
Yeah, it's like that.

01:11:11.484 --> 01:11:12.886
Look, why don't
you just go back

01:11:12.918 --> 01:11:14.119
where you came from, old man?

01:11:14.153 --> 01:11:15.221
What'd you call me?

01:11:15.253 --> 01:11:16.355
What, you
going deaf now too?

01:11:16.389 --> 01:11:17.891
No, I fuckin' hear you!

01:11:17.923 --> 01:11:18.992
What are you
waiting for?

01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:20.159
Get the fuck outta here!

01:11:32.572 --> 01:11:35.275
What the fuck?

01:11:39.278 --> 01:11:40.980
- You give me that!
- You're not moving?

01:11:41.012 --> 01:11:42.247
- You don't get this.
- What the fuck, man?

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:43.983
- Why you trippin'?!
- I don't know, bro!

01:11:44.015 --> 01:11:46.318
Why am I trippin'?
Why am I trippin'?!

01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:47.586
Yeah, why am I trippin', hey?

01:11:47.619 --> 01:11:51.190
Why am I trippin'?

01:12:05.938 --> 01:12:07.106
Oh...

01:12:16.548 --> 01:12:17.850
Wow...

01:13:07.565 --> 01:13:09.269
The fuck are you looking at?!

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:11.337
Get back to work!

01:14:24.076 --> 01:14:26.179
Dan?

01:14:31.182 --> 01:14:34.487
I just wanted you to know
that the kitchen's closed.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.423
Pretty much cleaned up.

01:14:37.456 --> 01:14:40.493
Angela saw to it that
all those dishes were remade

01:14:40.525 --> 01:14:45.163
to your specifications.

01:14:45.197 --> 01:14:48.001
She's good.

01:14:48.033 --> 01:14:49.201
It was a team effort.

01:14:49.234 --> 01:14:51.603
- Everybody stepped up.
- Yeah.

01:14:51.636 --> 01:14:53.305
Yeah, it's a solid crew.

01:14:54.439 --> 01:14:57.210
Chloe handled
the front house.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:58.511
It was, uh...

01:14:58.543 --> 01:15:01.713
chaotic there for a while,
but she took care of it.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:04.450
That's just part
of her job description.

01:15:04.483 --> 01:15:06.319
What?

01:15:06.351 --> 01:15:09.454
Nothing.

01:15:09.488 --> 01:15:12.125
She still here?

01:15:13.692 --> 01:15:16.096
Everyone's gone.

01:15:30.676 --> 01:15:32.278
Want a?

01:15:33.412 --> 01:15:35.347
Sure.

01:16:01.774 --> 01:16:03.643
I just wanted to
make food for people.

01:16:03.676 --> 01:16:06.345
I don't know...

01:16:06.377 --> 01:16:09.282
I thought it'd be simple.

01:16:09.314 --> 01:16:13.552
Honest and, uh,
primal, you know?

01:16:13.586 --> 01:16:18.291
I thought making something
with your hands, from scratch,

01:16:18.323 --> 01:16:21.626
building a whole place
from the ground up,

01:16:21.659 --> 01:16:25.264
you'd give everything
you got to it.

01:16:25.296 --> 01:16:28.233
I just thought...

01:16:28.266 --> 01:16:30.603
You had
nearly ten years here.

01:16:30.636 --> 01:16:34.474
That's a good run.

01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:37.409
Christ, it's practically
an eternity in this business.

01:16:39.811 --> 01:16:43.149
Yeah.

01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:46.086
Hurray for me.

01:17:02.568 --> 01:17:05.204
It's late.
You should go.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.777
You coming?

01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:14.347
Uh, no.
I'm gonna, uh...

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.815
I'm gonna stay.
I'm gonna lock up.

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.351
You sure
you're okay by yourself?

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:21.753
Mm, yeah.
No, I close alone, man.

01:17:21.787 --> 01:17:23.856
I always close alone.

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:28.928
No, I mean...

01:17:28.961 --> 01:17:31.431
Are you really okay, Dan?

01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:36.469
Fine.

01:17:45.778 --> 01:17:48.213
Hey, Steven.

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.615
Yeah?

01:17:50.815 --> 01:17:54.452
I'm not sorry, you know?

01:17:54.485 --> 01:17:56.521
I stuck to my guns,
no matter what.

01:17:56.555 --> 01:17:58.457
I mean, I accept responsibility
for everything, yeah,

01:17:58.489 --> 01:18:02.929
but I'd do it all again,
exactly the same.

01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:13.218
