WEBVTT

00:03.962 --> 00:06.381
<i>there have been violations</i>
<i>of Federal Security laws.</i>

00:06.548 --> 00:09.551
What if you could test your blood
in your own home?

00:09.926 --> 00:13.722
And what if it's not a whole vial,
but just a drop?

00:13.847 --> 00:20.395
I wanted to ask you if you would consider
investing my tuition money

00:20.478 --> 00:21.354
into the company?

00:21.604 --> 00:23.023
CHRIS:
<i>How would we pay for your tuition?</i>

00:23.314 --> 00:26.985
You won't have to, because
I'm... I'm going to drop out.

00:27.944 --> 00:32.115
You can't push me away again.
I'm going to protect you.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.199
I know.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.840
Fix it, Daddy, fix it.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.342
Fix it, Daddy, fix it.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.722
Fix it, Daddy, fix it.
Fix it, Daddy, fix it.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.307
Just tell her
you don't have time to fix it.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.060
But you can fix anything.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.604
- I'm gonna fix it, all right?

01:02.687 --> 01:04.606
- Okay? All right.
- Okay.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.691
- Okay.
- What time are you gonna be home?

01:06.816 --> 01:09.069
- I will... I'll call you later, okay?
- Bye.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.029
-It's not a regular day.
-Coming.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.530
It's demo day. Let's go.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.950
Why do you run so weird?
Well, I mean, I guess compared

01:16.076 --> 01:19.287
to other electrical engineers,
you run totally normal.

01:19.370 --> 01:23.583
At that time, we were trying
to develop a working prototype.

01:24.834 --> 01:29.798
- Who's "we"?
- Edmond Ku, head of engineering

01:29.964 --> 01:31.841
and Rakesh... Dewan...

01:33.093 --> 01:38.098
Ian... um, Gibbons, head of chemistry.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.020
I'm going to apply some pressure, Ian.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.563
Ow!

01:45.855 --> 01:47.816
- That hurts?
- Just a bit, yeah.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.193
He's been in a lot of pain.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.279
Only the foot. Who needs feet anyway?

01:53.696 --> 01:55.615
The pain in your feet is a late effect
of the chemo.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.327
It's called Hand-foot Syndrome.
The bad news is that it might not go away.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.082
Oh, God. Fucking hell.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.004
Did you know that chemotherapy
was discovered

02:10.088 --> 02:16.511
when two sadistic pharmacologists
decided to inject mice with mustard gas?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.681
That's a fun fact, honey,
but we need to get you back to work.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.351
Yeah. It's demo day.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.561
Ah!

02:24.727 --> 02:27.272
They focused on... the prototype.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.942
And my focus was...
I needed to bring in the money.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.558
Good morning.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.604
- Uh, can I get you some coffee?
- Yeah.

03:49.896 --> 03:54.275
Can I just say, I've never had a boss
who's like a girl my age, and it's so fun.

03:55.735 --> 03:56.861
Okay.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.864
Coffee would be great.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.792
<i>What would you attempt to do...</i>

04:12.126 --> 04:15.546
if you knew you could not fail?
What would you attempt to do?

04:15.797 --> 04:16.756
What would you...

04:18.633 --> 04:21.427
attempt to do
if you knew you could not fail?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.305
They're ready to demo now.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.686
I would like to order
a custom paperweight

04:29.852 --> 04:32.230
- with some words on it.
-Okay. What do you want it to say?

04:33.815 --> 04:36.109
ELIZABETH:
"What would you attempt to do..."

04:36.234 --> 04:38.403
Last night we worked on cache positioning
and cartridge seal,

04:38.528 --> 04:39.654
then I replumbed the system.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.615
Yeah, and we got rid of those
well-dressed-but-oh-so-sharp turns.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.242
Yeah, so it's not as pretty.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.120
But it's a gentler ride
for our little blood cell friends.

04:47.203 --> 04:50.248
It's incredible.
It's better than I imagined.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.958
We're still testing the coding.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.459
Edmond, you're so good.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.713
He's the best. He's not as good as me,
but he's good.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.340
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this is your vision, Elizabeth.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.843
And it's inspired everyone here.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.640
Oh, no. Guys, can I be really honest
with you right now?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.310
Every time I look at it,
I feel this tingle,

05:10.518 --> 05:12.895
but it's just in my left buttcheek.
It's not both.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.564
So, I'm just wondering why
it's just the left...

05:14.689 --> 05:16.149
Why are you talking about
how your butt feels

05:16.232 --> 05:18.401
- in front of Elizabeth right now?
- She doesn't care. Do you care?

05:18.943 --> 05:20.778
- Okay, are we ready?
- She was in college like yesterday.

05:20.903 --> 05:21.946
- Okay, okay.
- Are we ready?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.614
Yeah.

05:24.615 --> 05:25.742
Have I missed it?

05:25.867 --> 05:28.202
Ian, we are just getting started.

05:28.411 --> 05:33.291
Well, you can make room for this handsome,
crippled man. So...

05:34.334 --> 05:39.088
Um, everyone,
could you gather briefly? Quickly.

05:53.227 --> 05:57.440
What would you attempt to do
if you knew you could not fail?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.442
I'd wrestle an alligator.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.862
Today, together,

06:04.530 --> 06:05.948
we are taking the first step

06:06.824 --> 06:10.912
toward making healthcare accessible
to everyone in this country.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.168
That's why we work so hard.
Because this machine

06:17.835 --> 06:18.795
and all of us

06:20.129 --> 06:21.631
are going
to change the world.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.386
Yeah, we are. Whoo!

06:32.266 --> 06:35.853
But... But...
It's really just a demo, guys,

06:35.937 --> 06:38.606
so, you know, we've been testing
some blood for sepsis

06:38.731 --> 06:41.651
because that seems to be
the most reliable test we have so far.

06:41.818 --> 06:42.568
Okay?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.113
Can you just take the win?
He's so modest, right?

06:55.790 --> 06:59.001
Okay. So, I'm just going to add
the small blood sample

06:59.127 --> 07:02.046
to this cartridge and insert it
into the prototype,

07:02.130 --> 07:04.674
which will test it for sepsis. Here we go.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.543
Shit.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.756
You know what?

07:47.925 --> 07:48.968
It's fine.

07:51.762 --> 07:52.889
Oh, wow.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.308
Okay. I'll check the fusebox.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.436
Hello, I'd like to pay a bill.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.898
And could I actually put
on a different credit card?

08:02.064 --> 08:03.816
<i>Sure. What's your address?</i>

08:03.941 --> 08:07.445
You wanna know why you're out of money?
Because every one of those cartridges

08:07.570 --> 08:09.071
costs 200 dollars.

08:09.280 --> 08:12.658
Research at this scale is not cheap,
and I told you that.

08:12.909 --> 08:17.079
I've already raised
six million dollars from my parents,

08:17.163 --> 08:18.831
- and my family, and...
-Look, I'm sorry, but...

08:18.956 --> 08:21.125
- ...everybody that I know.
- Wait, are those ants?

08:23.002 --> 08:24.712
Yeah. Miriam!

08:25.004 --> 08:26.255
- Are they back?
- Yep.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.548
Where are they?

08:30.218 --> 08:33.387
You know the patents Ian is applying for,
so the next step...

08:35.264 --> 08:37.892
The next step is to bring in
pharmaceutical companies,

08:37.975 --> 08:40.895
get them interested to the point
where they will fund the research.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.690
What happened with Novartis?
Can we open a window or something?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.150
The windows don't open.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.404
Novartis won't meet with me
until I have working prototype,

08:50.488 --> 08:54.909
and I can't have a prototype
that works unless we have enough money

08:54.992 --> 08:59.872
for research, which I cannot get
until we have a contract with Novartis,

08:59.997 --> 09:03.918
- so it's completely illogical.
- That's running a start-up.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.256
Okay. They're all dead.
I'll get your salad?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.882
Yeah. Thank you.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.804
Are you sure you don't know anybody
who can invest a little bit more?

09:15.304 --> 09:18.558
Me? No, no, no, no, no, no.
You need to start asking for money

09:18.683 --> 09:22.061
from people you don't know.
You need to go out to Sandhill Road

09:22.270 --> 09:24.355
and start bringing in
venture capital firms.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.107
You've got to learn how to sell this.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.526
Here is your salad.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.153
Well, don't eat that in here.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.322
Why? I can't go outside,
I have too much work to do.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.448
This is why you have ants.

09:41.914 --> 09:42.999
I'll take those.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.548
So, you have a boyfriend?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.886
No. That would be too much
of a distraction.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.059
- Hi. I just wanna say that t...
- Hi, Edmond.

10:02.476 --> 10:03.769
Hey, um...

10:05.146 --> 10:08.858
don't worry about the demo,
Elizabeth, because we are gonna get there.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.236
We just... need more time.

10:13.029 --> 10:17.533
No problem, I'm gonna
get you more time. I'm gonna...

10:18.242 --> 10:19.493
I'm gonna find the money.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.370
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.436
This is the RDX metabolic profiler.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.189
Using one drop of blood,

10:48.814 --> 10:51.108
we can perform hundreds of tests.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.488
What is your background?
Are you a Ph.D. or medical doctor?

10:57.031 --> 10:59.158
I dropped out of Stanford
two years ago.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.286
This next slide is, um...

11:03.329 --> 11:04.288
This next...

11:12.046 --> 11:15.966
The blood goes into the cartridge,
and then it flows

11:16.133 --> 11:19.512
through different channels.
Much like this picture, uh...

11:19.804 --> 11:22.431
Do we have any kiwis?
If we don't have any kiwis,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.934
I'll take a star fruit.
Do you want one?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.770
- A star fruit?
- A kiwi.

11:29.146 --> 11:32.233
I don't think so. So, the... the...

11:36.904 --> 11:37.988
Whoo!

11:38.489 --> 11:41.575
- You slide the cartridge into the machine.
- Yeah, you do.

11:42.451 --> 11:48.249
And the result is done in real-time
and then transmitted to our website.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.126
Wait. You don't use needles?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.585
There's a microneedle

11:52.378 --> 11:54.964
that extracts
eight microliters of blood.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.133
I don't understand how you doing
this extremely complex

11:57.216 --> 12:00.136
chemical engineering
with essentially a high school degree.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.433
- You have a working prototype?
- Not yet.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.102
Can you use the microneedle
anywhere in your body?

12:09.019 --> 12:12.148
- Uh, and... I'm...
- What's your plans to scale this?

12:12.815 --> 12:13.858
Currently, we have none.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.861
So, you haven't even been met
with any pharmaceutical companies yet?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.237
Fuck!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.573
- It's not for us.
- It's a pass.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.491
Yeah, it's gonna be a pass for us.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.005
Do it. Do it right now.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.288
Don Lucas's office.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.041
One moment.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.336
Larry Ellison for you.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.381
Okay. I'll tell her.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.846
Miss Holmes,

13:26.472 --> 13:28.599
Don just had something pressing come up.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.352
- I'm afraid he's gonna have to reschedule.
- No.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.145
You don't wanna reschedule?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.106
No, I... You can't just cancel
an appointment.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.193
I'm here already,
and our company

13:39.318 --> 13:41.987
- is doing something really important.
- Of course.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.826
And Channing Robertson,
who's the head of chemical engineering

13:46.909 --> 13:48.828
at Stanford is on our board.
He's...

13:49.870 --> 13:50.788
He's on our board.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.915
We are a real company.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.501
And I had an appointment.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.337
Are you all right?

13:58.420 --> 14:00.881
Can... Can I get you a cup of coffee?

14:01.465 --> 14:04.885
Would you just tell Don Lucas
that he has lost a chance

14:04.969 --> 14:10.391
to disrupt a seven-billion-dollar
blood testing industry?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.142
Could you tell him that?

14:14.061 --> 14:16.188
- I'll be sure to tell him that.
- Thank you.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.703
Would it be possible
to leave some materials?

14:45.342 --> 14:46.594
Oh, I don't see anything.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.389
Ah, patience, my friend. Now...

14:53.058 --> 14:55.394
- chemiluminescence.
-Wow.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.982
Light which is generated
without the creation of heat.

15:00.608 --> 15:04.111
- We call it... cold light.
- Chemiluminescence.

15:04.737 --> 15:10.034
It's how fireflies emit light in the dark.
Also, there's glowsticks that...

15:10.159 --> 15:11.493
teenagers on drugs like.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.205
And we're using it for light-based assays.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.958
For example, liver function.

15:19.418 --> 15:24.214
So, if we are testing for liver function,
what would you see? What would happen?

15:25.049 --> 15:29.470
Uh, chemiluminescent amino acids
will make liver enzymes

15:29.762 --> 15:31.555
from the blood compete with a...

15:32.556 --> 15:33.682
Luminol bound...

15:33.807 --> 15:35.601
Luminol bound synthetic form

15:37.394 --> 15:38.395
to bind to the chips,

15:38.520 --> 15:41.273
so if we measure how greatly
the sample glows

15:41.398 --> 15:44.318
then we can determine
how well the liver's functioning.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.403
Exactly.

15:47.279 --> 15:51.367
Fortunately, human beings
are not transparent

15:51.450 --> 15:55.704
and we absorb light.
So, our job... our job is to...

15:55.829 --> 15:57.164
is to make the blood glow,

15:57.915 --> 16:00.751
so that it reveals the body's secrets
to us.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.549
Listen, don't worry,
you'll find an investor.

16:08.884 --> 16:13.180
Yeah, of course the succubi
at Sandhill Road didn't like you, but...

16:14.556 --> 16:20.729
they want everything done fast.
And science is maddeningly slow.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.316
And they don't know
the first thing about biochemistry.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.403
I don't either.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.989
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

16:32.074 --> 16:36.495
I'm not a chemist, so I mean,
I don't have experience.

16:36.704 --> 16:40.374
No, no, no. You're not a chemist,
but I said yes.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.335
You asked me to work here
and I said yes.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.962
Because you're friends with Channing.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.297
No. No. Because...

16:47.840 --> 16:50.592
I'd been poked
with needles every other day

16:50.718 --> 16:54.138
when I had cancer. And...
and when I was at my lowest,

16:54.263 --> 16:56.515
I felt... I felt like a specimen.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.558
Like a...

16:58.392 --> 16:59.893
like a lab rat, you know?

17:00.394 --> 17:03.689
And we can do something

17:04.565 --> 17:05.691
to make that better.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.695
I knew you were young
when I agreed to come and work here,

17:09.778 --> 17:13.949
but you had a... you had a vision.

17:14.867 --> 17:19.705
And you're a bit...
you're a bit chemiluminescent, aren't you?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.332
And you possess that rare gift of...

17:23.292 --> 17:24.877
creating light from within.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.630
So, you'll light all of us up
and show us what we're made of.

17:31.091 --> 17:36.221
Although, just out of curiosity, um,
when will we run out of money?

17:36.430 --> 17:39.933
Just so I know, so when to,
you know, run off to find another job

17:40.059 --> 17:44.063
for the health insurance,
because I do have this tendency

17:44.229 --> 17:47.691
- to occasionally get cancer, you know?
- We're just fine.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.990
- Hello. Who are you?
- Ian, this is my friend. He...

17:55.199 --> 17:58.827
actually... He's here
to pick something up. Um, uh...

17:59.119 --> 18:01.663
- Thank you. Have a good night.
- Right.

18:03.791 --> 18:04.708
Good night.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.597
- I had a bad day.
- I know. Fuck them all.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.516
Fuck everyone.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.065
Did you hear that?
I think someone's out there.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.162
- There's no one there.
- I thought I heard somebody.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.249
I'm a secret.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.126
Just at work.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.670
I told my parents about you.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.798
I like being a secret.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.218
- Really?
- Just don't keep secrets from me.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.891
I don't want to have to explain this
to anyone.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.227
Can I fit in there?

19:35.382 --> 19:37.467
Elizabeth, Don Lucas is here.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.719
What?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.305
He's downstairs.
He's just standing there in a cowboy hat.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.266
What do you mean
"He's just standing there"?

19:44.391 --> 19:46.643
Stall him, the box is in pieces.
Tell the engineers.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.978
Got it.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.740
Hello, Don. Elizabeth Holmes.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.534
- Ah.
- We were not expecting you.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.329
Well, I didn't wanna miss my opportunity

20:05.495 --> 20:07.414
to disrupt
a seven billion dollar industry.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.416
Oh, you heard that? Okay.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.087
Look, I got 15 minutes.
Where's this prototype of yours?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.883
Perfect. Well, welcome to Theranos.

20:18.842 --> 20:19.718
The name is a mix

20:19.801 --> 20:23.347
- between therapy and diagnosis. We're...
- Just show me the tech.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.807
Right. Okay.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.899
RAKESH: 127,
do you think you can get it there?

20:33.982 --> 20:34.983
- 'Cause I...
- Okay. Okay.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.318
- How is this gonna work?
- Remove that.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.487
- We're gonna remove it altogether.
- What are you talking about?

20:39.196 --> 20:44.868
This is our brainstorming room
where we let our brains run free.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.497
I've got ten minutes left.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
We need more tape strips.
Rakesh, can you get that?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.042
- Yeah. I can get it.
- Okay, and get the cartridges from there.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.752
Whoa! Come on, man.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.464
- Shit, shit. Sorry.
- Oh, fuck. Oh, my God, it's blood.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.841
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Hey, hey. Do we know that...

21:00.092 --> 21:04.221
Did this gets tested for hepatitis, HIV?
Somebody fucking speak!

21:04.304 --> 21:07.349
I need a new shirt.
Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me!

21:07.933 --> 21:10.727
Guys, let's clean this up. Come on.
Let's go, let's go. Clean this up.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.325
Do you wanna follow me this way?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.332
It's a bit of a maze in here.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.420
Herschel! Give me your shirt. Give me it.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.883
And here we are.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.344
This is where the magic happens.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.808
So, if you wanna follow me
over here,

21:51.101 --> 21:52.144
let me show you...

21:55.522 --> 21:58.692
I could show you
the RDX metabolic profiler.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.780
- The RDX-meta-what?
- The RDX metabolic profiler.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.950
Well, you're gonna need a new name.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.203
Fire it up. Let's see what it does.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.126
You know what, Don?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.296
We're not ready to show it.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.716
But I can give you some more information
about it and maybe...

22:22.799 --> 22:25.761
Yeah, okay. I... I go by my gut
on these sort of things.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.140
Yeah, well...

22:31.683 --> 22:32.809
thanks for the tour.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.023
Don.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.820
The blood-testing industry
is run by two companies.

22:44.029 --> 22:48.033
Quest and Labcorp,
and they are dinosaurs.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.535
The tech is ancient.
These machines that are currently

22:50.660 --> 22:52.120
in use are archaic.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.332
These billion-dollar companies
expect us

22:55.540 --> 22:59.461
to let them stick us with needles
and then pay for their expensive tests.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.672
No, this is America. We're cowboys, right?

23:03.090 --> 23:04.966
We should be in control
of our own healthcare.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.428
You were in the army and thank you
for your service.

23:08.553 --> 23:13.183
Could you imagine a portable
blood testing device on the battlefield?

23:14.142 --> 23:16.019
The American lives that could be saved.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.274
Don, if all you wanted to do was
to make money,

23:21.400 --> 23:23.402
you'd be on Wall Street,
not in Palo Alto.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.864
And when Larry Ellison came to you
with his vision for how Oracle

23:27.948 --> 23:30.617
could organize data,
you didn't tell him that he was crazy,

23:30.784 --> 23:32.369
you said, "How much do you need?"

23:35.205 --> 23:37.999
If you believe in us, everyone else will.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.297
Whatever you're doing tomorrow,
cancel it.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.966
I want you to meet Larry Ellison.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.563
Whoo!

24:09.865 --> 24:11.241
When are you going to move in?

24:12.200 --> 24:14.453
- It depends.
- On what?

24:15.829 --> 24:17.789
On how it goes today
with my parents.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.625
Yes, I'm every parent's dream.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.669
Is that your new sword?

24:23.378 --> 24:24.296
Katana.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.256
Look at it.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.008
It's fucking ancient.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.429
Ask Larry Ellison about katanas,
he loves Japan.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.849
How are you on the numbers?

24:37.142 --> 24:41.605
Uh, most blood tests are priced too high.
We offer a low-cost alternative

24:41.688 --> 24:44.232
with the possibility to scale up.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.984
Don't talk about saving the world.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.028
I'm not gonna talk
about saving the world.

24:48.403 --> 24:52.115
Don't use your giddy voice.
Don't say "awesome."

24:54.242 --> 24:55.285
You're beautiful.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.624
But you don't want
to be too beautiful.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.585
They won't take you seriously.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.421
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.300
<i>Hi. We just landed.</i>

25:10.425 --> 25:12.969
<i>Here's your father,</i>
<i>he's dying to talk to you.</i>

25:13.261 --> 25:15.222
-<i>Elizabeth.</i>
- How was the flight?

25:16.056 --> 25:18.683
Fine. What time are you meeting
with Larry Ellison?

25:18.850 --> 25:20.060
And have you worked on your pitch?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.521
Now, and yeah.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.524
Ask her if she's still meeting us
at the restaurant.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.484
I don't wanna meet this boyfriend
without her.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.861
If he gets there first,
how do we know it's him?

25:30.153 --> 25:32.822
He's mid-30s, Pakistani.

25:32.948 --> 25:33.823
Ow!

25:34.199 --> 25:35.116
Is Dad, okay?

25:35.367 --> 25:39.246
<i>I asked to reschedule,</i>
<i>but his doctor said he was okay to travel.</i>

25:39.329 --> 25:42.666
I had routine outpatient surgery,
weeks ago. I'm fine.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.252
It'll be an hour, tops, okay? Bye.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.419
- Bye.
-Elizabeth.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.423
I'm Larry.

25:50.882 --> 25:56.012
Oh, Larry. Hi. I'm Elizabeth Holmes,
founder and CEO of Theranos.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.265
No one told you we were going
on a boat, huh?

26:00.809 --> 26:01.935
Come on. I'll help you up.

26:04.604 --> 26:05.814
Watch your step.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.817
Sunny. Hi, uh,

26:09.442 --> 26:12.362
I'm on his boat and I...
I don't know how long

26:12.445 --> 26:13.738
I'm gonna be on the boat.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.075
- Can you hear me?

26:17.659 --> 26:18.577
- Sunny?
-Elizabeth!

26:21.913 --> 26:23.123
So, what do you think?

26:24.165 --> 26:28.670
It's awesome. I... To be honest with you,
I don't know that much about boats.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.464
I didn't know shit about boats,
I just started buying 'em.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.969
Now I race in The America's Cup.
Wanted to be a leader in tech,

26:36.386 --> 26:38.388
became a leader. You a leader?

26:39.889 --> 26:41.391
I think so, yeah.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.852
You want a husband, kids?
'Cause that's gonna slow you down.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.562
You have a wife and kids.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.772
Seriously? Come on.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.277
Have you heard of Satori?

26:52.569 --> 26:55.322
Watch out. Larry loves to talk
about all this Japanese stuff.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.742
Yeah, I got the biggest tea garden
in North America.

26:59.034 --> 27:02.579
Brought the structures in from Japan
and added about 500 trees but...

27:03.121 --> 27:07.667
But Satori is Buddhist enlightenment.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.669
It's that moment

27:09.794 --> 27:12.380
where you can look inside yourself
and know just who you are.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.758
You experienced Satori?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.260
I don't think so.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.555
You wanna see something cool?

27:30.607 --> 27:33.193
Now, this is where you really feel like
you're on a boat.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.404
So, what I'd really like
to talk to you about

27:36.488 --> 27:39.366
is the seven-billion-dollar
blood testing industry.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.702
Yeah, Don took me through it,
but let me ask you again.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.538
Are you a leader?
Because if you want this,

27:45.664 --> 27:47.832
you really have to dedicate yourself
to it.

27:48.291 --> 27:51.378
You have to be aggressive,
start firing people, have you...

27:51.586 --> 27:53.797
- have you fired anybody yet?
- Not yet.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.676
Well, then you gotta fight.
That's what it takes to be a CEO.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.053
That's what it takes
to run a billion-dollar company.

28:00.303 --> 28:02.764
- Is that what you really want?
- Yes.

28:02.972 --> 28:06.309
Good! Then let's stop fucking around.
What are you willing to do to get it?

28:06.726 --> 28:09.437
We're working on a prototype.
And we're hoping to get a meeting

28:09.562 --> 28:13.149
- with a pharma company like Novartis.
- And? What's stopping you?

28:13.483 --> 28:15.944
I'm having a hard time getting them
to talk to me.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.197
Then you gotta hustle.
Oracle's first contract. Do you remember?

28:19.447 --> 28:21.491
Yeah. The software was still a mess.

28:22.367 --> 28:26.746
And you know what I said? I said nothing.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.290
- Nothing.
- GTFM.

28:29.457 --> 28:30.375
"Get the fuckin' money."

28:30.500 --> 28:32.085
"Get the fuckin' money."

28:32.293 --> 28:34.838
Do you get the fuckin' money?

28:36.381 --> 28:40.677
- I... I get the fuckin' money. Yeah!
- Then show me! Show me!

28:41.052 --> 28:45.348
I get the fuckin' money!
I get the fuckin' money!

28:45.598 --> 28:47.100
- Get the fuckin' money!
- I get the fuckin' money!

28:47.267 --> 28:49.561
- Get the fuckin' money!
- GTFM! I get the fuckin' money!

28:49.811 --> 28:52.564
- Yeah! Get it!
- Get the fuckin' money!

28:52.731 --> 28:53.857
- Get it!
-GTFM!

28:53.982 --> 28:55.024
- Get fuckin' money!
-Yeah!

28:55.191 --> 28:57.235
-Get the fuckin' money!
- Yeah! Money!

28:57.736 --> 28:59.821
- I get the fuckin' money!
-Yeah! Get the fuckin' money!

28:59.988 --> 29:01.448
-Get the fuckin' money!
-Yeah!

29:04.617 --> 29:05.702
I hope you didn't need that.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.122
If I get you a meeting at Novartis,

29:10.039 --> 29:11.666
and you're able to demo the prototype...

29:13.293 --> 29:15.503
- then I'm in.
- Then you're in?

29:16.171 --> 29:19.549
Then you got Don Lucas and me.
Hey, you want somethin' to drink?

29:19.674 --> 29:21.468
Champagne? Beer? Green tea?

29:25.972 --> 29:29.434
Oh, my mom's called like, three times.
I... Can I get this?

29:29.601 --> 29:30.685
You serious?

29:32.061 --> 29:33.605
-<i>Elizabeth?</i>
- Mom?

29:33.730 --> 29:34.856
<i>We're at the hospital.</i>

29:41.112 --> 29:42.572
-Hi!
-You're here.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.949
Everything is fine.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.827
He collapsed in the restaurant.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.413
It was just a complication
from his surgery.

29:50.747 --> 29:53.875
He went to triage and no one
was helping us and then...

29:54.918 --> 29:58.505
Sunny just took care of all of it.
He called the hospital

29:58.713 --> 30:03.510
and they put us in here.
In the VIP room.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.806
- He just took care of all of it.
- Come on. It was easy.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.184
I'm gonna have snacks.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.729
I wasn't going to let anything happen
to him.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.274
- Thank you.
-Elizabeth?

30:20.151 --> 30:21.110
Hi, Dad.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.696
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.283
Why did you leave the boat?

30:29.577 --> 30:30.912
What do you mean?
I...

30:31.788 --> 30:33.706
I wanted to see you. I wanted to be here.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.459
You shouldn't have left.
You shouldn't be here.

30:37.043 --> 30:38.086
You have work to do.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.923
I... I do... I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.676
Are you hearing me?

30:45.552 --> 30:47.470
It's all of your tuition money.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.099
Go back to work.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.603
Go.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.288
Go. I've got this.

31:25.800 --> 31:29.387
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

31:29.596 --> 31:33.725
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

31:34.350 --> 31:37.854
<i>- Happy birthday dear Edmond</i>
<i>- Happy birthday giant pussy!</i>

31:37.937 --> 31:39.689
All right. All right. All...

31:39.856 --> 31:42.483
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

31:42.609 --> 31:43.943
Why is no one working?

31:49.157 --> 31:51.701
- Edmond, may I speak with you?
- Yeah.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.664
You can blow them out.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.504
Whoo!

32:04.297 --> 32:05.757
Do you know what this is about?

32:09.719 --> 32:10.678
What's up?

32:12.555 --> 32:14.223
Can the prototype do the sepsis test?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.684
No, we're still pretty far away.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.979
Well, why is...
why isn't everyone working?

32:20.104 --> 32:22.065
We... We're just taking a break.
Uh...

32:22.857 --> 32:24.359
You know we routinely put in

32:24.525 --> 32:25.735
- 12-hour days...
- What is that?

32:26.569 --> 32:27.695
Oh, that...

32:27.862 --> 32:29.864
That... That's...
that's for my daughter.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.616
She, um... It was broken,

32:31.783 --> 32:33.993
so I was just tinkering
with it at lunchtime.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.204
Your daughter plays with it?

32:37.288 --> 32:38.456
What... what does she do with it?

32:39.207 --> 32:40.458
She bakes things.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.294
Why doesn't she use a real oven?

32:46.089 --> 32:48.466
Because real ovens
are dangerous for kids.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.097
Larry Ellison is getting us
a meeting at Novartis...

32:55.098 --> 32:58.017
and you need to run your team
24 hours a day in shifts

32:58.142 --> 33:00.228
and work does not stop
until we run a successful test.

33:00.436 --> 33:03.898
You want me to ask people
to work 24 hours a day?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.150
You know, Elizabeth,
they have families, they have lives.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.652
They'll... They'll burn out,
they'll quit.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.863
But people are replaceable.
If you can't do this,

33:10.989 --> 33:12.740
I'm gonna start firing people.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.661
And get that outta here.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.580
Okay. Okay.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.177
Miriam.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.056
I know. It looks weird.
The paperweight place said

33:37.181 --> 33:40.184
- it was too many words. I asked them...
- It's Edmond Ku's Birthday today.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.438
Let's arrange to get him something...

33:44.313 --> 33:47.525
a gift, like, something nice.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.651
Okay.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.571
I... don't know what people like.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.032
He has a daughter.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.576
Oh, okay. No problem.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.721
That was an original piece.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.433
Dude, you're so pale right now.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.770
I mean, you're grey. You're Ash-ian.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.191
You look like a powdered donut.
Look in the mirror.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.110
You can go home, Rakesh.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.237
You go home, I'm not goin' home
until we figure out

34:33.321 --> 34:35.114
why the blood keeps clotting.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.120
Well, let's try this. Uh...

34:41.496 --> 34:42.705
I put on the new coding.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.416
It won't work,
but at least it'll tell us where we are.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.293
Okay.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.149
Wait a minute. Bro...

35:10.608 --> 35:12.318
I got a reading.
The test came back.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.486
Shut up.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.029
I don't have sepsis.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.949
Holy shit.
I don't have sepsis. It works.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.661
As long as the room doesn't get below 68
or above 77 degrees.

35:21.869 --> 35:22.829
I gotta fuckin' hug you.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.541
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh, no, no. Okay.
- Yes!

35:26.666 --> 35:29.877
Yes! I am going on a business trip.
Yeah!

35:31.379 --> 35:33.840
Seriously, this is huge.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.717
This is Google, this is Yahoo!
But wait... No, no, no. This is better.

35:36.843 --> 35:40.888
- This is... this is gonna help people.
- I wish we had time to run more trials.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.851
Can you unclench? Unclench! I love you!
Say it back, you!

35:44.934 --> 35:48.062
- I love you, Rakesh.
- I love you too! Oh, my God!

35:48.187 --> 35:49.147
Okay. Okay.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.439
- I can't...
- Let's go wake them up.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.482
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.697
- Guess what.
- What?

35:58.072 --> 36:00.199
We... we have sepsis.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.285
- We do, we have... we have sepsis.
- We didn't...

36:02.368 --> 36:04.036
- Yeah, we didn't have it before.
- We have it now.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.498
- Sepsis, right.
- We have sepsis? We have sepsis!

36:08.374 --> 36:09.876
We have sepsis!

36:10.251 --> 36:16.048
We have sepsis!
We have sepsis! We have sepsis!

37:10.770 --> 37:13.439
Hi, sorry. We have a problem.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.577
It's been consistent?

37:27.828 --> 37:28.788
Every time.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.168
Girls, girls, girls, girls.
Wait for us. Wait for us.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.301
- Just one second.
- Edmond. Come on.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.011
One second. One second.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.513
Girls, no. Don't go too far.

37:46.847 --> 37:47.723
Yep.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.141
ELIZABETH:
<i>We just keep getting an error message.</i>

37:49.225 --> 37:50.518
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Hey, your prototype's not working.</i>

37:50.601 --> 37:51.644
ELIZABETH:<i> We need your help, Edmond.</i>

37:51.727 --> 37:53.271
RAKESH:<i> I don't know why,</i>
<i>something must have happened</i>

37:53.354 --> 37:54.605
<i>on the flight,</i>
<i>it was almost 12 hours total.</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:56.357
ELIZABETH:<i> I promised Novartis</i>
<i>a working prototype.</i>

37:56.440 --> 37:58.859
-<i>You gotta help us figure it out.</i>
- I'm gonna be right behind you.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.361
But we only have the sales team here.

38:00.569 --> 38:03.698
<i>- Okay, we gotta recalibrate it. So...</i>
-Fuck.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.449
We need someone's blood.
You.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.080
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>the plate carriage is sealed?</i>

38:11.163 --> 38:12.123
-Yeah.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.666
<i>Is the main case fan</i>
<i>still spinning?</i>

38:13.749 --> 38:15.209
- Mm-hmm.
- EDMOND:<i> It just keeps reading "error".</i>

38:15.543 --> 38:18.296
<i>There could be a light leak, Rakesh.</i>
<i>Try turning off all the lights.</i>

38:20.047 --> 38:22.842
-Come on! Come on! Come on!

38:23.884 --> 38:25.636
- Error.
- Okay, do another, Tommy.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.265
- I can't feel my fingers.
- I don't care! Okay, I'll do it!

38:31.767 --> 38:33.561
Another. Do another.

38:36.188 --> 38:39.191
- Another. Error!
- Fucking shit!

38:39.400 --> 38:41.736
-Another. Another.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.073
- Fuck this shit!

38:46.198 --> 38:48.242
<i>Find the light leak.</i>
<i>Put towels over that window.</i>

38:48.367 --> 38:50.119
No, wait. Just wait. Just wait.
Just wait.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.787
Somebody call room service,
I have an idea.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.331
ELIZABETH:
Why would you call room service?

38:53.414 --> 38:54.582
- I don't understand?
- Just trust me.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.585
No light.
I'm putting in the card.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.922
<i>Rakesh, don't get crumbs</i>
<i>on the box. What are you doing?</i>

39:02.006 --> 39:04.342
<i>You have to clean your fingers after...</i>
<i>after you eat them, because...</i>

39:04.425 --> 39:05.718
- Shit. Shit. Shit!

39:05.926 --> 39:08.012
Okay. All right,
maybe it's the temperature.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.931
Maybe like a thermocouple
got damaged in the flight, huh?

39:19.190 --> 39:20.941
<i>Guys, guys. No, no, no.</i>
<i>It's too cold now.</i>

39:21.067 --> 39:22.610
<i>Remember it's Switzerland</i>
<i>in the winter.</i>

39:22.777 --> 39:25.363
<i>- You're practically in the Arctic.</i>
- What do you want us to do, Edmond? Huh?

39:26.530 --> 39:28.616
<i>Guys, what's going on there?</i>
<i>I can't see.</i>

39:31.911 --> 39:35.539
Body heat. Don't worry,
I won't take my clothes off.

39:36.791 --> 39:37.875
Card is in.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.420
<i>Where's Rakesh? What's he doing?</i>
<i>What... Rakesh, what are you doing? Okay.</i>

39:41.629 --> 39:42.963
<i>Don't hug it too hard, Rakesh.</i>

39:43.214 --> 39:44.965
- There's no error message.
<i>- Okay? It can't handle it.</i>

39:45.674 --> 39:47.551
- There's no error message.
-<i>Guys, am I on mute?</i>

39:47.635 --> 39:48.511
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

39:48.636 --> 39:50.179
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Is... Are you looking at...</i>

39:50.304 --> 39:52.014
- Oh, my God.
-Shit, shit, shit.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.182
It's not actually in.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.060
Hold on. Okay. Okay. Now, it's in.

39:59.855 --> 40:02.608
-No. No. No.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.406
No.

40:11.033 --> 40:13.202
<i>Okay, guys. Let's take it apart.</i>

40:18.874 --> 40:20.501
<i>Okay, you just wanna soften up the portal.</i>

40:20.668 --> 40:21.752
I know, bro.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.671
ELIZABETH:<i> There's no more blood</i>
<i>left in my fingers.</i>

40:24.130 --> 40:25.047
Daddy?

40:26.715 --> 40:30.010
Hey, sweetie. Hi! Oh, my gosh.

40:30.636 --> 40:35.224
<i>Did you guys have fun? Hmm?</i>
<i>What's on your face? Are you a giraffe?</i>

40:37.143 --> 40:38.853
All right. Let's go sit in the tub now.
Come on.

40:39.019 --> 40:40.396
Okay. Okay. All right.
I'll be with you guys.

40:40.479 --> 40:41.605
- Okay, baby.
- Come on. Come on.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.983
- Okay. Okay, uh...

40:46.068 --> 40:50.072
Yeah.
Sorry, guys. I'm just... Fire!

40:50.406 --> 40:53.951
Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.669
What...

41:05.045 --> 41:06.088
Why...

41:07.590 --> 41:08.799
Why did this happen?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.676
<i>I explained...</i>

41:11.927 --> 41:13.679
<i>it wa... it wasn't reliable.</i>

41:13.971 --> 41:17.683
<i>I... I don't know, maybe...</i>

41:21.020 --> 41:26.025
<i>Maybe you should get some sleep,</i>
<i>Elizabeth. You... you look exhausted.</i>

41:34.533 --> 41:36.202
Yeah. Yeah.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.956
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Thank you for your help, Edmond.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.291
EDMOND:<i> Your welcome...</i>

41:43.459 --> 41:46.879
Okay. Uh, thanks, guys,
I think we're done.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.137
Good work, man. Thanks.

41:55.679 --> 41:57.223
Try and get some sleep. Yeah?

41:59.016 --> 42:01.519
- Rakesh?
-Thank you. Yeah?

42:03.312 --> 42:04.396
Hey.

42:06.065 --> 42:08.317
What are we gonna show at the demo?

42:09.318 --> 42:10.778
I thought we were going to bed.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.074
Yeah, but,
what are we gonna show at the demo?

42:15.407 --> 42:18.661
I don't understand. I...
we're gonna tell them

42:18.827 --> 42:20.287
that we don't have a working prototype.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.206
But it worked before.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.792
Everybody saw it.

42:27.294 --> 42:28.796
We still have a reading saved...

42:31.131 --> 42:32.258
from when it worked.

42:33.592 --> 42:34.635
Right?

42:40.849 --> 42:42.351
Just one drop of blood...

42:47.439 --> 42:50.776
gets put into our
Theranos branded cartridges.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.249
And we can change the world.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.054
They started 20 minutes ago.

43:20.472 --> 43:21.807
Have you heard anything?

43:23.058 --> 43:24.101
Not yet.

43:26.312 --> 43:29.231
You know, this is supposed
to be the brainstorm room,

43:30.190 --> 43:33.652
it was my idea and I've never been in it.

43:37.948 --> 43:38.866
Um...

43:40.409 --> 43:42.077
Strange thing. Uh...

43:43.329 --> 43:47.124
You know,
Elizabeth put her name down

43:48.125 --> 43:51.545
for our patent applications
as one of the inventors.

43:52.755 --> 43:56.425
- Did she work on the inventions?
- Not in any scientific way.

44:00.679 --> 44:01.639
Herschel.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.433
Hi, fellas.

44:05.517 --> 44:06.977
What are you doing here so late?

44:23.702 --> 44:26.705
You'll have to excuse us,
it doesn't always take this long

44:26.789 --> 44:31.168
to beam test results from a single drop
of blood across the world.

44:52.856 --> 44:54.358
- I haven't announced this yet,

44:55.067 --> 44:56.860
but our series B round

44:56.985 --> 44:59.863
closed at a 165 million dollars.

45:09.832 --> 45:13.335
So, here's to Don Lucas and Larry Ellison!

45:16.213 --> 45:18.882
And let's party!

45:29.560 --> 45:31.353
Ooh.

45:33.439 --> 45:35.399
- Are you okay?

45:35.774 --> 45:40.070
I got the money. I got the fuckin' money.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.232
- What are you doing here?
- Oh God...

46:20.277 --> 46:21.278
Did you call him?

46:22.321 --> 46:24.782
I thought you might need a ride home,
so I went through your phone

46:24.865 --> 46:27.326
and found his number.
I’m really sorry if that... I just...

46:27.451 --> 46:28.535
Let’s go outside for a moment.

46:36.126 --> 46:37.127
You’re fired.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.606
- What happened?

46:59.441 --> 47:00.776
It’s a Christmas party.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.028
You’re their boss.

47:04.279 --> 47:05.989
They look up to you.
You’re better than this.

47:07.032 --> 47:09.326
I don’t think I am....

47:16.458 --> 47:17.501
We faked the demo.

47:21.213 --> 47:22.339
In Switzerland.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.185
The device wasn't working
and we couldn’t fix it.

47:36.728 --> 47:42.317
<i>So, I had somebody send in</i>
<i>fake test results</i>

47:43.527 --> 47:46.780
from the test we'd done before.

47:54.329 --> 47:58.083
- We need to talk.
- Not now, man.

47:59.793 --> 48:01.587
I know what you did at Novartis.

48:01.795 --> 48:05.924
Okay. Calm down. Why are you breathing
so hard? Just relax.

48:07.175 --> 48:11.930
I mean, it’s going to work.
It just didn’t that day.

48:13.056 --> 48:14.349
I didn't know what to do.

48:15.100 --> 48:19.563
When we get the box to work,
we’re not even gonna remember this.

48:20.188 --> 48:23.442
We’ll be geniuses and you’ll be able
to tell this story

48:23.525 --> 48:25.944
at a conference wearing flip-flops.

48:28.614 --> 48:29.948
This is how it works.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.785
Just dance, Edmond.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.293
Don’t tell anyone else.

48:43.795 --> 48:44.838
Just you.

48:47.090 --> 48:48.258
Good.

48:49.343 --> 48:50.510
Okay.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.724
I don’t feel things the way
other people feel things.

48:58.477 --> 48:59.478
I know.

49:01.772 --> 49:02.898
But I love you.

49:04.816 --> 49:05.901
I know.

49:11.907 --> 49:15.953
We were all working
almost 24 hours a day,

49:16.119 --> 49:17.287
seven days a week.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.623
We were...

49:21.416 --> 49:22.668
trying to do something good.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.235
I would have graduated this year.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.281
- Now you're a fucking millionaire.

50:04.042 --> 50:07.170
-Yes! Fuck everyone!
-Whoo-hoo!

50:08.839 --> 50:11.508
I’m gonna change the world!
