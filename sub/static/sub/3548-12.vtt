WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.076
LYNETTE DALLIED
WITH TEMPTATION...

00:05.076 --> 00:07.078
ARE YOU SLEEPING
WITH MY WIFE?

00:07.078 --> 00:10.181
CARLOS STRUGGLED
WITH HIS NEW LIFE...

00:10.181 --> 00:14.185
I AM POOR, AND I AM BLIND,
AND THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT THAT

00:14.185 --> 00:15.516
THAT IS YOUR TYPE.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.588
BREE FOUND HERSELF
WITH A NEW RIVAL...

00:17.588 --> 00:21.292
BREE, THAT IS, LIKE,
THE BEST PIE YOU'VE EVER MADE.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.324
(Bree) THIS IS NOT MY PIE.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.426
(laughs) OKAY, YOU CAUGHT ME.
IT'S MINE.

00:25.426 --> 00:30.131
AND SUSAN MADE THE BEST
OF HAVING HOUSEGUESTS.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.133
OH, AND, LISTEN,
BOB AND LEE INTRODUCED US

00:32.133 --> 00:33.634
TO THIS WONDERFUL CONTRACTOR,

00:33.634 --> 00:35.806
SO WE WON'T BE IMPOSING
FOR LONG.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.308
IMPOSING? WHO'S IMPOSING?

00:37.308 --> 00:40.111
YOU CAN STAY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

00:44.175 --> 00:46.177
(Mary Alice) IN A CORRIDOR

00:46.177 --> 00:48.179
OF THE GREENWOOD
REHABILITATION CENTER

00:48.179 --> 00:50.421
IS A SIGN.

00:50.421 --> 00:55.556
IT'S THERE TO REMIND PATIENTS
TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE PAST.

00:57.788 --> 01:01.192
BUT ORSON HODGE
DID NOT NOTICE IT.

01:01.192 --> 01:04.364
HE WAS TOO BUSY
THINKING OFHISPAST,

01:04.364 --> 01:09.740
OR AT LEAST THE PART OF IT
HE SHARED WITH MIKE DELFINO.

01:11.642 --> 01:15.206
ORSON THOUGHT
OF THE NIGHT THEY MET--

01:15.206 --> 01:18.249
THE NIGHT HIS MOTHER...

01:18.249 --> 01:21.512
HAD MURDERED HIS MISTRESS.

01:23.254 --> 01:25.816
HE THOUGHT
OF THE NEXT TIME THEY MET

01:25.816 --> 01:30.161
AND HOW MIKE
BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE HIM.

01:34.125 --> 01:39.200
HE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER'S FEAR
MIKE WOULD REMEMBER TOO MUCH

01:39.200 --> 01:43.874
AND HER DEMAND THAT ORSON
STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING.

01:43.874 --> 01:47.138
HE THOUGHT OF HOW HE AGONIZED,

01:47.138 --> 01:48.879
BUT IN THE END,

01:48.879 --> 01:51.482
HAD STILL...

01:51.482 --> 01:53.814
DONE THE UNTHINKABLE.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.821
ORSON THEN STARTED TO THINK

02:00.821 --> 02:03.394
ABOUT THE MESSAGE
HE HAD RECEIVED FROM MIKE,

02:03.394 --> 02:05.696
ASKING HIM TO VISIT.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.261
THE THOUGHT
WAS CROSSING ORSON'S MIND

02:10.261 --> 02:13.304
THAT MIKE HAD
REMEMBERED SOMETHING--

02:13.304 --> 02:15.436
SOMETHING DANGEROUS,

02:15.436 --> 02:18.409
WHEN SUDDENLY...

02:18.409 --> 02:21.272
ORSON. COME ON IN.

02:21.272 --> 02:24.875
THE TIME FOR THINKING
WAS OVER.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.183
SO I-I SEE THEY HAVE
A TENNIS COURT HERE.

02:32.183 --> 02:34.185
MUST BE NICE TO GET OUT

02:34.185 --> 02:36.187
AND WHACK
A FEW BALLS AROUND, HUH?

02:36.187 --> 02:38.189
WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

02:38.189 --> 02:40.491
IT MIGHT MAKE THIS EASIER.

02:44.235 --> 02:45.296
(sighs)

02:45.296 --> 02:47.798
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT ALL DAY

02:47.798 --> 02:49.800
JUST HOW
I WAS GONNA DO THIS.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.343
DO WHAT, MIKE?

02:52.343 --> 02:56.207
SINCE I'VE COME HERE, I'VE HAD
A LOT OF TIME TO THINK.

02:58.209 --> 03:01.382
THINGS ARE...
BECOMING CLEARER.

03:02.813 --> 03:05.316
I'M STARTING TO PUT
SOME THINGS TOGETHER.

03:05.316 --> 03:07.388
OH? (chuckles nervously)

03:07.388 --> 03:08.889
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

03:08.889 --> 03:12.293
NO, NOT REALLY, ORSON.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.829
WHEN YOU HURT PEOPLE,

03:18.829 --> 03:20.671
YOU GOTTA BE ACCOUNTABLE.

03:20.671 --> 03:23.203
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.736
SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU...

03:27.538 --> 03:30.941
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FORGIVE ME?

03:32.583 --> 03:33.944
WHAT?

03:38.289 --> 03:41.892
WHEN I ASKED YOU TO WRITE
A PRESCRIPTION FOR PAIN PILLS,

03:41.892 --> 03:45.296
IT... ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS GETTING MY NEXT FIX.

03:45.296 --> 03:48.228
THE FACT THAT YOU COULD HAVE
LOST YOUR LICENSE,

03:48.228 --> 03:51.231
YOUR BUSINESS--ALL THAT
NEVER EVEN ENTERED MY HEAD.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.465
(sighs)
AND I AM... REALLY SORRY.

03:54.465 --> 03:57.738
OH.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.311
OF COURSE.

04:00.311 --> 04:02.313
NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

04:02.313 --> 04:03.274
(chuckles)

04:03.274 --> 04:06.777
WOW. I-I FEEL
A MILLION TIMES BETTER.

04:06.777 --> 04:08.319
(chuckles nervously)

04:08.319 --> 04:10.521
YOU KNOW, ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED HERE--

04:10.521 --> 04:13.023
IF YOU DON'T GET THIS STUFF
OFF YOUR CHEST,

04:13.023 --> 04:15.926
IT'LL EAT YOU ALIVE.
 (slaps leg)

04:18.358 --> 04:19.660
AS HE LEFT,

04:19.660 --> 04:23.634
ORSON THOUGHT ONLY
OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND RELIEF,

04:23.634 --> 04:26.537
IGNORING COMPLETELY

04:26.537 --> 04:32.042
THE FEELINGS OF GUILT AND SHAME
THAT WERE RISING WITHIN HIM.

04:32.042 --> 04:36.607
THAT WAS THE SAD THING
ABOUT ORSON HODGE...

04:36.607 --> 04:38.609
HE HAD NO IDEA

04:38.609 --> 04:52.763
JUST HOW SICK HE REALLY WAS.

04:52.763 --> 04:57.398
FROM THE MOMENT HIS DOCTORS
HAD TOLD HIM HE WAS BLIND,

04:57.398 --> 05:01.972
CARLOS SOLIS HAD WORRIED
ABOUT ONLY ONE THING--

05:01.972 --> 05:04.635
THAT THE PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE

05:04.635 --> 05:09.079
WOULD COME TO SEE HIM
AS A BURDEN.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.081
BUT AS IT TURNED OUT,

05:11.081 --> 05:14.485
HIS FRIENDS DIDN'T MIND
DRIVING HIM TO THE STORE.

05:14.485 --> 05:19.920
HIS NEIGHBORS DIDN'T MIND
HELPING RETRIEVE HIS MAIL.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.922
THE PAPER BOY DIDN'T MIND

05:21.922 --> 05:25.756
HELPING HIM FIND
HIS MORNING PAPER.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.458
IN TRUTH,

05:27.458 --> 05:30.561
EVERYONE ON WISTERIA LANE
WAS MORE THAN WILLING

05:30.561 --> 05:34.034
TO HELP CARLOS
ADJUST TO LIFE AS A BLIND MAN--

05:34.034 --> 05:36.407
EVERYONE, THAT IS...

05:36.407 --> 05:37.708
BUT HIS WIFE,

05:37.708 --> 05:39.710
WHO WAS
QUICKLY STARTING TO FEEL

05:39.710 --> 05:42.613
SHEWAS THE ONE
WITH THE HANDICAP.

05:42.613 --> 05:45.676
"AND IN A SURPRISE MOVE,
THE SPURS ANNOUNCED A TRADE

05:45.676 --> 05:48.579
THAT WILL SEND
PERENNIAL ALL-STAR TO THE..."

05:48.579 --> 05:50.521
OH, JEEZ, GABY.

05:50.521 --> 05:53.954
I ASKED YOU TO PLEASE FISH OUT
ALL THE LITTLE CARROT SQUARES.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.458
I DID.
 WELL, I THINK YOU MISSED SOME.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.491
COULD YOU GET 'EM OUT,
PLEASE?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.438
THERE YOU GO. ALL GONE.

06:07.438 --> 06:11.402
DID YOU JUST USE YOUR HAND?
 OF COURSE NOT.
I USED A SPOON.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.373
(spoon clatters)

06:13.373 --> 06:16.777
(sighs) I'M SORRY
THAT I'M SUCH A HANDFUL.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.780
I REALLY AM TRYING TO DO
THE BEST THAT I CAN.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.013
I KNOW YOU ARE, BABE.
AND I KNOW IT'S HARD,

06:23.013 --> 06:26.116
AND I'M GONNA TRY TO BE
MORE SENSITIVE TO YOUR NEEDS.

06:26.116 --> 06:29.119
NOW HURRY UP AND FINISH.
I HAVE TO GO TO THE STORE.

06:29.119 --> 06:31.121
COULD I GO, TOO?
I'M BORED.

06:31.121 --> 06:34.124
OH, PLEASE, CARLOS.
I HAVE A MILLION ERRANDS TO RUN,

06:34.124 --> 06:35.626
AND I'D DO IT
A LOT FASTER WITHOUT YOU.

06:35.626 --> 06:38.128
PLUS I'M HAVING LUNCH
WITH THE GIRLS FIRST.

06:38.128 --> 06:39.600
OH, OKAY.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.402
(mouth full)
MM. GABY, ANOTHER CARROT.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.706
JUST EAT THEM.
CARROTS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR...

06:45.706 --> 06:47.778
JUST EAT THEM.

06:49.780 --> 06:54.014
(indistinct conversations)

06:54.014 --> 06:56.517
SORRY I'M LATE. BLIND HUSBAND.
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.689
OH, GABY,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

06:58.689 --> 07:01.692
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL
EVERYONE TO KEEP AN EYE OUT

07:01.692 --> 07:04.595
FOR THEIR INVITATION
TO THE FOUNDER'S BALL.
 (gasp)

07:04.595 --> 07:07.027
I'M SORRY.
WHAT IS THE FOUNDER'S BALL?

07:07.027 --> 07:09.029
YOU ALL SEEM SO EXCITED.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.762
IT'S A BLACK-TIE FUND-RAISER
THAT BREE ORGANIZES EVERY YEAR.

07:11.762 --> 07:15.536
IT'S A LOT OF WORK, EXHAUSTING
AND COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.708
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET YOUR
BIG MOMENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.710
BREE GETS TO PRESENT AN AWARD

07:19.710 --> 07:22.473
TO SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY FOR THE COMMUNITY.

07:22.473 --> 07:25.546
OOH, I SAY WE NOMINATE THE WOMAN
WHO GIVES EDIE HER BIKINI WAX.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.548
HA HA HA HA.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.049
SO, BREE,

07:29.049 --> 07:32.222
I'VE PLANNED A FEW EVENTS
MYSELF BACK IN CHICAGO.

07:32.222 --> 07:34.655
SMALL POTATOES COMPARED
TO THIS, I'M SURE,

07:34.655 --> 07:37.828
BUT IF YOU COULD USE ME,
I'D LOVE TO HELP.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.032
THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

07:42.032 --> 07:44.064
(chuckles)

07:44.064 --> 07:45.866
IT WOULD?

07:45.866 --> 07:49.469
YES, OF COURSE.
WHY WOULDN'T IT?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.603
NOBODY? OKAY, I'M GOING IN.

07:52.603 --> 07:55.946
BECAUSE YOU TWO WOULD KILL
EACH OTHER... LITERALLY.

07:55.946 --> 07:57.808
IT'LL START
WITH HAIR PULLING

07:57.808 --> 07:59.810
AND END WITH DETECTIVES
TAKING OUR STATEMENTS.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.513
REMEMBER THE PIE THING?
 "REMEMBER THE PIE THING"--

08:02.513 --> 08:04.484
TIBETAN MONKS
REMEMBER THE PIE THING.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.858
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KATHERINE
AND I HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

08:07.858 --> 08:10.120
BUT WE HAVE ALL BEEN
THROUGH A LOT RECENTLY.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.793
AND I WOULD HOPE
THAT IT TAUGHT US

08:12.793 --> 08:14.825
TO PUT OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE
AND BE FRIENDS,

08:14.825 --> 08:18.929
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT.

08:18.929 --> 08:21.501
I FACED CANCER AND A TORNADO,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.674
BUT I'M RUNNING FROM THIS.

08:23.674 --> 08:26.607
(women laugh)

08:37.618 --> 08:39.919
HI.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.522
(whispers)
OH, MY GOD. RICK.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.823
(normal voice) HI.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.556
HOW ARE YOU?

08:45.556 --> 08:47.057
GREAT, ACTUALLY.

08:47.057 --> 08:48.559
WE'RE GREAT.

08:48.559 --> 08:50.661
WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT.

08:50.661 --> 08:52.202
MM.

08:52.202 --> 08:55.836
OH. HEY, TOM.
LOOK WHO'S HERE--RICK.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.568
I SEE THAT.

08:57.568 --> 08:59.109
TABLE FOR ONE?

08:59.109 --> 09:01.141
UH, NO, THANKS.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.244
I JUST WANTED TO COME BY
AND BRING YOU GUYS...

09:04.244 --> 09:05.576
IT'S BAROLO.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.578
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM ITALY.

09:07.578 --> 09:09.580
OH, WELL, THAT'S NICE.
THANK YOU.

09:09.580 --> 09:13.023
AH, WHAT'S THE OCCASION? OR ARE
YOU JUST BEING A GOOD GUY?

09:13.023 --> 09:16.226
(chuckles) I CAN'T GET ANYTHING
PAST YOU, HUH, TOM?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.091
WELL, I...
I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO.

09:21.091 --> 09:22.593
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

09:22.593 --> 09:25.596
I WANTED TO COME HERE
AND TELL YOU GUYS IN PERSON.

09:25.596 --> 09:28.799
I'M OPENING MY OWN PLACE.
UH, YOU MUST HAVE SEEN IT.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.974
THAT'S YOU?
 ON THE CORNER?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.976
YEAH, I LOOKED EVERYWHERE,
I SWEAR.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.679
BUT, UH,
IT WAS THE BEST LOCATION.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.811
I'LL BET.

09:40.811 --> 09:42.813
OKAY, LOOK, PEOPLE LIKE
TO EAT IN FAIRVIEW.

09:42.813 --> 09:45.055
THERE'S PLENTY OF BUSINESS
FOR BOTH OF US.

09:45.055 --> 09:46.987
(man) HEY, I REMEMBER YOU!

09:46.987 --> 09:49.720
YOU BACK
TO WORKING HERE NOW?
 OH, NO. SORRY.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.963
TOO BAD.
THAT OSSO BUCO OF YOURS WAS--

09:52.963 --> 09:55.125
REALLY SOMETHING.

09:55.125 --> 09:59.069
WELL, I GOT IT ON THE MENU
AT MY NEW PLACE ON THE CORNER.

09:59.069 --> 10:00.600
COME CHECK US OUT.

10:02.332 --> 10:05.605
SEE? ROOM FOR EVERYONE.

10:21.351 --> 10:24.695
(muttering indistinctly)

10:34.735 --> 10:38.168
OH! ORSON, YOU SCARED ME.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.642
WHY ARE YOU SITTING
DOWN HERE IN THE DARK?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.715
AND AREN'T YOU
A LITTLE COLD?

10:44.715 --> 10:47.017
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

10:47.017 --> 10:50.650
THEN YOU CAME DOWN HERE AND YOU
COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.953
(clicks tongue) THAT HAPPENS
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.186
WELL, THE BABY IS INSISTING

10:56.186 --> 11:01.061
THAT I EAT THE LAST PIECE
OF BREE'S TRIPLE-CHOCOLATE CAKE.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.994
IF YOU WANT, WE COULD--

11:03.994 --> 11:06.897
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE NAKED!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.801
IN MY KITCHEN WHERE I EAT.

11:13.403 --> 11:15.906
OKAY,
I DON'T HEAR YOU LEAVING.

11:15.906 --> 11:17.908
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

11:17.908 --> 11:21.952
PAJAMAS--THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU COULD DO.

11:21.952 --> 11:23.453
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:23.453 --> 11:25.455
YOU'RE A GUEST IN MY HOUSE--

11:25.455 --> 11:27.457
A COMPLETELY NAKED GUEST
IN MY HOUSE.

11:27.457 --> 11:29.860
(voice breaking)
I SHOULD LEAVE.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.194
HEY.
 HEY.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.196
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HOME AT 8:00

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
TO HELP ME WRANGLE THE KIDS
FOR BATH TIME.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.730
IT'S--IT'S ALMOST 11:00.

11:39.730 --> 11:41.101
SORRY.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.934
(faucet turns on,
water running)

11:43.934 --> 11:46.476
SO WHERE WERE YOU?

11:46.476 --> 11:49.439
YOU WERE STEWING,
WEREN'T YOU?

11:49.439 --> 11:51.942
COME ON.

11:51.942 --> 11:54.384
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT RICK.

11:54.384 --> 11:55.886
LOOK. (clears throat)

11:55.886 --> 11:59.850
I'M NOT GONNA DENY
I WAS TICKED OFF WHEN I SAW HIM.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.221
BUT I'M OVER IT.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.393
I'M TAKING THIS
AS A CHALLENGE.

12:03.393 --> 12:06.056
WE ARE GONNA UP OUR GAME.

12:06.056 --> 12:08.799
OH, YEAH?
 YEP. YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
TONIGHT?

12:08.799 --> 12:10.801
I WORKED ON OUR MENU.

12:10.801 --> 12:13.303
WE ARE GONNA START MAKING
OUROWNOSSO BUCO.

12:13.303 --> 12:15.305
I GOT A RECIPE
THAT IS GONNA KICK HIS ASS.

12:15.305 --> 12:17.137
SO YOU'RE REALLY OKAY
WITH THIS?

12:17.137 --> 12:20.010
YEAH, I'M GREAT.
LOOK AT HOW CUTE YOU ARE.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.843
OH?
 (laughs)
IT'S GROWING BACK FAST, HUH?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.114
(chuckles)

12:28.849 --> 12:32.222
YEAH, IT'S BACK.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.895
(clears throat)

12:44.895 --> 12:47.237
MORNING, SUSAN.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.902
OH. GOOD MORNING.

12:51.902 --> 12:54.304
LOVE WHAT YOU'RE WEARING.

12:54.304 --> 12:56.907
OH,
I HOPE THIS ISN'T DECAF.

12:56.907 --> 12:59.209
GOT A BIG DAY AHEAD OF ME.

13:00.811 --> 13:03.313
ALL RIGHT. WE DON'T NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:03.313 --> 13:05.385
JUST PROMISE ME
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.887
WHAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

13:06.887 --> 13:10.190
ORSON, YOU WERE NAKED
IN THIS KITCHEN LAST NIGHT.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.462
I WAS NOT.

13:12.462 --> 13:14.224
YOU MOST CERTAINLY WERE.

13:14.224 --> 13:16.927
GOOD MORNING.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:16.927 --> 13:20.971
WELL, SUSAN CLAIMS SHE SAW ME
LAST NIGHT AU NATUREL.
 IT WASN'T A CLAIM.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.974
HE WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE
WITHOUT A STITCH OF CLOTHING ON,

13:23.974 --> 13:27.507
AND I COULDN'T HAVE CAKE.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.980
OH, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.982
SOMEBODY HAD
A NAUGHTY DREAM.

13:31.982 --> 13:35.215
SUSAN, I'M BLUSHING.

13:35.215 --> 13:39.089
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO,
I DID NOT HAVE A SEX DREAM.

13:39.089 --> 13:42.452
SUSAN,
IT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

13:42.452 --> 13:44.995
MIKE'S AWAY.
YOU'RE FEELING A LITTLE LONELY.

13:44.995 --> 13:46.997
NATURALLY,
YOU'D PROJECT THOSE FEELINGS

13:46.997 --> 13:48.929
ONTO THE NEAREST AVAILABLE
 SEX MACHINE.

13:48.929 --> 13:49.930
OH!

13:49.930 --> 13:52.002
(laughs)
 YOU ARE SUCH A SCAMP.

13:52.002 --> 13:53.503
(both) MWAH.

13:53.503 --> 13:56.506
I KNOW WHEN I'M DREAMING,
AND THIS REALLY HAPPENED.
 (door opens and shuts)

13:56.506 --> 14:00.170
WHY ELSE WOULD I BE SPONGING
BUTT PRINTS OFF MY STOOL?

14:00.170 --> 14:03.313
YOU KNOW, SUSAN, SOMETIMES
I CLIMB INTO A WARM BATH

14:03.313 --> 14:05.946
WITH A ROMANCE NOVEL.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.948
JUST A THOUGHT.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.951
(door opens and shuts)

14:10.951 --> 14:12.322
(resumes spraying)

14:12.322 --> 14:15.155
(man) YOU WANNA GIVE ME
A HAND WITH THIS?

14:15.155 --> 14:17.027
UGH.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.563
(grunts)

14:25.395 --> 14:27.037
LYNETTE!

14:27.037 --> 14:29.869
GABY, SINCE WHEN DO YOU COME
TO PRICE WAREHOUSE?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.342
I'M POOR NOW. REMEMBER?

14:32.342 --> 14:35.045
I HAVE TO MINGLE
WITH THE UNWASHED MASSES.

14:35.045 --> 14:37.047
WHAT AREYOUDOING HERE?

14:37.047 --> 14:39.950
OH, I'VE BEEN UNWASHED
FOR YEARS.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.251
THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

14:41.251 --> 14:44.484
WOULD IT KILL THEM
TO HAVE VALET PARKING?

14:44.484 --> 14:47.317
GABY, PEOPLE DON'T COME HERE
FOR THE AMENITIES.

14:47.317 --> 14:50.991
THEY COME BECAUSE
TOILET PAPER'S 3 CENTS A TON.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.062
OH.

14:53.924 --> 14:56.226
LOOK AT ALL
THESE HANDICAPPED SPOTS.

14:56.226 --> 14:58.898
I MEAN, WHAT A WASTE.
TAKE THAT GUY SELLING ORANGES,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.932
PUT HIM IN A VEST,
STICK HIM UNDER AN UMBRELLA,

15:01.932 --> 15:03.934
AND BAM!
YOU GOT VALET PARKING.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.937
I DON'T KNOW WHY POOR PEOPLE
REFUSE TO BETTER THEMSELVES.

15:06.937 --> 15:08.939
YEAH,
WE'RE CRAZY THAT WAY.

15:08.939 --> 15:10.240
I DON'T KNOW WHY

15:10.240 --> 15:12.242
YOU'RE COMPLAINING
ABOUT HANDICAPPED SPACES.

15:12.242 --> 15:14.644
DOESN'T CARLOS HAVE ONE
OF THOSE BLUE PLACARDS?

15:14.644 --> 15:16.646
NO, I THINK YOU HAVE
TO HAVE A WHEELCHAIR

15:16.646 --> 15:18.648
TO GET ONE OF THOSE.

15:18.648 --> 15:21.151
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
THE BLIND QUALIFY, TOO.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.930
MOM, CAN I TAKE SOME
OF THESE COOKIES UP TO JULIE?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.433
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER SOME
TO OUR GUEST FIRST?

15:33.433 --> 15:36.436
OH, NO, THANK YOU. WE HAVE
SO MUCH GROUND TO COVER.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.668
NOW LET'S MOVE ON
TO THE FLOWERS.

15:38.668 --> 15:40.170
UH, LAST YEAR,

15:40.170 --> 15:44.074
WE WENT WITH A CASCADE
OF PINK AND WHITE ROSES.

15:44.074 --> 15:45.375
THERE IT IS.

15:45.375 --> 15:46.376
EXQUISITE.

15:46.376 --> 15:48.118
WELL, EASY ENOUGH.

15:48.118 --> 15:50.620
LET'S JUST DO THAT
AGAIN, THEN.

15:50.620 --> 15:51.951
NEXT?

15:54.324 --> 15:56.086
WELL...
(chuckles nervously)

15:56.086 --> 15:58.228
IF YOU HAVE
A DIFFERENT IDEA,

15:58.228 --> 16:00.730
I WOULD LOVE
TO HEAR THAT, TOO.

16:00.730 --> 16:03.263
WELL, I WAS THINKING

16:03.263 --> 16:06.336
IT MIGHT BE NICE TO DO
SOMETHING MOREUNUSUAL.

16:06.336 --> 16:11.541
WHAT ABOUT AN ARRANGEMENT
OF PURPLE LISIANTHUS

16:11.541 --> 16:14.504
WITH A SPRAY
OF DARK BERRIES?

16:14.504 --> 16:17.607
IT'S INTERESTING. I CAN'T
REALLY PICTURE THAT, THOUGH.

16:17.607 --> 16:20.150
WELL, LET ME HELP YOU.

16:24.654 --> 16:27.017
I KEEP SCRAPBOOKS, TOO.

16:27.017 --> 16:31.121
(laughs nervously)

16:31.121 --> 16:34.164
MY MOM AND MRS. HODGE ARE STILL
TALKING ABOUT THAT BALL THING.

16:34.164 --> 16:37.697
SHE WANTS ME TO BE A PART
OF THE FOUNDER'S COURT

16:37.697 --> 16:39.699
OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.302
LIKE I WANT TO PUT ON
A STUPID WHITE DRESS

16:42.302 --> 16:44.334
AND GREET PEOPLE ALL NIGHT.

16:44.334 --> 16:47.777
I KNOW. IT'S SO PATHETIC.
BY THE WAY, I'M DOING IT.

16:47.777 --> 16:50.280
SERIOUSLY?WHY?

16:50.280 --> 16:52.282
BECAUSE I DID IT LAST YEAR,

16:52.282 --> 16:55.185
AND IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
HILARIOUS AND GREAT.

16:55.185 --> 16:59.149
IT IS!
 IT DOESN'T SOUND GREAT.
IT SOUNDS BEYOND LAME.

16:59.149 --> 17:01.051
(scoffs)

17:01.051 --> 17:04.054
I DON'T WANT THIS TO COME OFF
THE WRONG WAY,

17:04.054 --> 17:06.126
BUT YOU'RE A BUZZ KILL.
 JULIE!

17:06.126 --> 17:09.229
OKAY, YOU SPEND ALL OF YOUR TIME
COOPED UP IN HERE ALONE,

17:09.229 --> 17:11.401
OBSESSING OVER
SOME MYSTERIOUS THING

17:11.401 --> 17:14.404
THAT MAYBE HAPPENED TO
YOUR REAL DAD OR MAYBE DIDN'T.

17:14.404 --> 17:16.536
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING
DON'T OBSESS.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.038
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE
YOU COULD SPARE SOME TIME

17:19.038 --> 17:22.172
TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN
WITH YOUR FRIEND, TOO.

17:22.172 --> 17:24.743
(sighs)

17:24.743 --> 17:27.817
SO THIS FOUNDER'S THING--
IT'LL BE FUN?

17:27.817 --> 17:29.379
(chuckles)

17:29.379 --> 17:31.451
UH, THESE WERE
THE CENTERPIECES

17:31.451 --> 17:34.454
FROM THE VANOVER MEDICAL CENTER
BENEFIT.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.487
THE DONORS WERE BLOWN AWAY.

17:37.487 --> 17:40.190
WELL, THEY'RE CERTAINLY...
ASSERTIVE.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.491
MY ONLY FEAR IS--

17:41.491 --> 17:44.194
I KNOW. I KNOW.

17:44.194 --> 17:46.736
FAIRVIEW IS A BIT MORE
PROVINCIAL COMPARED TO CHICAGO,

17:46.736 --> 17:48.838
BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THE PEOPLE HERE

17:48.838 --> 17:52.202
HAVE A LOT MORE TASTE
THAN YOU GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR.

17:52.202 --> 17:54.474
(chuckles)

17:54.474 --> 17:58.077
WELL, PERHAPS I COULD TRY
SOMETHING NEW.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.350
LET'S GO
WITH THE LISIANTHUS.

18:00.350 --> 18:04.114
LOOK AT YOU! PRONOUNCING IT
RIGHT THE VERY FIRST TIME.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.318
ISN'T LEARNING FUN?

18:18.268 --> 18:22.172
(doorbell rings)

18:24.634 --> 18:26.376
MRS. SCAVO?

18:26.376 --> 18:28.278
UH, YES.
 IS YOUR HUSBAND HOME?

18:28.278 --> 18:30.540
WE'RE INVESTIGATING AN INCIDENT
INVOLVING VANDALISM.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.242
VANDALISM?

18:32.242 --> 18:35.515
PORTER! PRESTON!
GET OVER HERE!

18:35.515 --> 18:38.288
NO, MA'AM. THIS INCIDENT
OCCURRED TWO NIGHTS AGO

18:38.288 --> 18:40.290
NEAR YOUR PIZZERIA.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.792
SOMEONE THREW A BRICK THROUGH
A WINDOW OF A NEW RESTAURANT--

18:42.792 --> 18:44.894
A PLACE CALLED RICK'S?
 WHAT?

18:44.894 --> 18:47.457
WE'RE ASKING EVERYBODY
WHO WORKS IN THE AREA

18:47.457 --> 18:50.460
IF THEY SAW
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.
 I DIDN'T GO INTO WORK
THAT NIGHT.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.263
I DID, BUT, UM,
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

18:53.263 --> 18:56.266
WHAT TIME DID IT HAPPEN?
 THE ALARM WENT OFF
AT ABOUT 10:45.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.568
OH, I WAS HOME WAY BEFORE THEN,
AROUND 8:00.

18:58.568 --> 19:01.671
I CAME HOME EARLY TO HELP YOU
WRANGLE THE KIDS FOR BATH TIME.

19:01.671 --> 19:04.214
(sighs)
 YEAH. NO, HE WAS HERE.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.546
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF YOU DO
HAPPEN TO HEAR ANYTHING,

19:06.546 --> 19:08.878
COULD YOU GIVE US A CALL,
PLEASE?
 ABSOLUTELY.

19:08.878 --> 19:10.480
THANK YOU.
 HEY.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.323
MM.
 OH, OH, HEY, HONEY.
COULD YOU HOLD BACK A SEC?

19:13.323 --> 19:14.824
NOPE. UH, LUNCH RUSH.

19:14.824 --> 19:17.627
I'M ALREADY LATE AS IT IS,
OKAY? SEE YA.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.304
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

19:34.304 --> 19:36.175
OH, HEY THERE.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.177
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T SEE
THAT BIG BLUE SIGN.

19:38.177 --> 19:42.682
THIS IS HANDICAPPED PARKING.
 I KNOW.
PRIMO SPOT, ISN'T IT?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.884
WHAT? I HAVE A THINGY.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.386
YEAH, I NOTICED THAT.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.319
YOU DON'T LOOK HANDICAPPED
TO ME.

19:49.319 --> 19:51.321
I'M NOT. MY HUSBAND IS.
HE'S BLIND.

19:51.321 --> 19:53.223
WELL,
THEN THAT PLACARD'S FOR HIM.

19:53.223 --> 19:55.225
ONLY HE CAN PARK HERE.

19:55.225 --> 19:58.568
AND HOW IS HE GONNA PARK A CAR
IF HE CAN'T SEE?

19:58.568 --> 20:02.201
(scoffs) FEELING
PRETTY STUPID NOW, AREN'T YA?

20:09.739 --> 20:11.741
LADY,
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE.

20:11.741 --> 20:14.914
I HAD TO PARK NEXT
TO THE DUMPSTER WAY IN THE BACK.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.916
OH, DON'T PLAY VICTIM
WITHME.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.419
I HAVE TO WALK IN HEELS
ALL DAY LONG.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.252
YOU GET TO SIT IN A CHAIR
AND ROLL.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.394
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT!

20:24.394 --> 20:26.956
YOU KNOW, THE QUICKER
I CAN RUN MY ERRANDS,

20:26.956 --> 20:29.259
THE FASTER I CAN GET HOME
TO MY HUSBAND,

20:29.259 --> 20:31.861
WHO NEEDS ME, BECAUSE THAT'S
THE KIND OF PERSON I AM.

20:31.861 --> 20:34.964
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 CALLING THE COPS.
YOU'RE GETTING A TICKET.

20:34.964 --> 20:38.408
LIKE HELL I AM!
GIVE ME THAT.
 GET OFF!

20:38.408 --> 20:41.471
NO! YOU STARTED IT.
HANG IT UP!
 OW! GET OFF!

20:41.471 --> 20:44.314
HANG IT UP! (grunts)
 AAH!

20:44.314 --> 20:47.246
HEY, HEY! OH!
 IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
JEEZ. WHAT, IS THERE A TELETHON
GOING ON AROUND HERE?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.922
DUDE,
SHE TOOK ONE OF OUR SPOTS.

20:52.922 --> 20:56.426
BITCH! I HAD TO FIND
STREET PARKING.

20:56.426 --> 20:59.859
HEY, THERE'S A SECURITY GUARD
OVER THERE. GO GET HIM.
 NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WAIT!

20:59.859 --> 21:02.362
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.435
OH, NO, NO.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

21:05.435 --> 21:06.366
HEY!
 LET ME GO!

21:06.366 --> 21:08.698
HEY! HEY! STOP!
 LET ME GO!

21:08.698 --> 21:10.470
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T--
OW!

21:10.470 --> 21:12.802
AAH! AAH!

21:12.802 --> 21:16.446
WELL, IT'S OFFICIAL.
I'M GOING TO HELL.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.552
(Kayla) HI, DADDY.
 HEY.

21:22.552 --> 21:25.315
HEY, GUYS, WOULD YOU GO PLAY
IN THE BACK FOR A WHILE?

21:25.315 --> 21:27.317
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR DAD.
THANKS.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.619
WELL... (chuckles)

21:29.619 --> 21:32.362
HEY. DON'T THEY
HAVE SOCCER TODAY?

21:32.362 --> 21:35.365
LET ME ANSWER THAT QUESTION
WITH ANOTHER QUESTION.

21:35.365 --> 21:37.367
WHY DID YOU LIE TO POLICE?

21:37.367 --> 21:40.830
LYNETTE--
 AND YOU MADEME
 LIE TO THEM, TOO,

21:40.830 --> 21:43.403
WHICH BRINGS UP
ANOTHER QUESTION.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.736
DID YOU KNOW THAT PERJURY IS,
LIKE, THIS WHOLE BIG THING?
 I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

21:46.736 --> 21:50.309
NO, OVERREACTING WOULD BE
IF I THREW A BRICK THROUGH YOU.

21:52.682 --> 21:54.644
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

21:54.644 --> 21:57.316
HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

22:00.089 --> 22:06.025
I JUST WENT TO GO CHECK OUT
HOW THE CONSTRUCTION WAS GOING,

22:06.025 --> 22:08.027
BUT I CAME AROUND THE CORNER.

22:08.027 --> 22:11.000
I SAW THIS GIANT PICTURE WINDOW
THAT SAYS "RICK'S."

22:11.000 --> 22:14.003
AND THEN I REALIZE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SEE THAT GUY'S NAME

22:14.003 --> 22:16.906
EVERY DAMN DAY OF MY LIFE.

22:19.369 --> 22:21.441
THEN I NOTICED
THIS PILE OF BRICKS.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.112
OKAY.

22:23.112 --> 22:26.345
I KNOW
THIS WHOLE THING WITH RICK--

22:26.345 --> 22:29.018
IT REALLY CAUSED US
SOME DAMAGE.

22:29.018 --> 22:32.652
I KNOW IT HURT US, BUT WE
SURVIVED IT, AND IT'S OVER NOW.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.654
NOW THAT'S THE THING,
LYNETTE.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.727
IT'S NOT OVER.
IT WASNEVEROVER.

22:37.727 --> 22:40.960
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
RICK'S STUPID RESTAURANT!

22:40.960 --> 22:43.493
I DON'T EVEN CARE THAT
HE WANTS TO STEAL YOU FROM ME!

22:43.493 --> 22:46.496
OF COURSE, HE WOULD WANT
TO STEALYOUFROMME.

22:46.496 --> 22:49.869
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

22:49.869 --> 22:54.043
I CARE THAT HE MADE YOU ACT
LIKE ITCOULDBE DONE.

22:54.043 --> 22:56.506
OH, TOM.

22:56.506 --> 22:59.549
HE CHANGED THE WAY
I LOOK AT YOU.

23:02.952 --> 23:04.383
(bottles clink)

23:04.383 --> 23:07.517
BUT...

23:07.517 --> 23:11.491
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN US.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.424
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
COME ON!

23:14.424 --> 23:17.166
I AM NOT TRYING TO GET YOU
TO APOLOGIZE.

23:17.166 --> 23:20.570
I'M JUST EXPLAINING
THE BRICK.

23:28.578 --> 23:30.009
(door opens)

23:39.519 --> 23:41.491
OH, MY GOD.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.954
AHA!

23:44.954 --> 23:47.997
YOU THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY,
BUT IT WASN'T A DREAM.

23:47.997 --> 23:49.529
YOU'RE NAKED!

23:49.529 --> 23:51.501
AND THAT MEANSYOU'RECRAZY.

23:51.501 --> 23:53.963
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT.

23:53.963 --> 23:55.565
OH, REALLY?

23:55.565 --> 23:58.938
YOU JUSTHAPPENEDTO STUMBLE
NAKED INTO MY FRONT YARD?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.440
I DIDN'T MEAN IT, MIKE.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.573
"MIKE"? WAIT.

24:03.573 --> 24:05.214
ARE YOU SLEEPWALKING?

24:05.214 --> 24:06.716
ORSON.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.481
HELLO?

24:11.481 --> 24:12.952
(gasps)

24:17.957 --> 24:19.489
(grunts) OW!

24:23.693 --> 24:26.195
SUSAN.

24:26.195 --> 24:28.197
DID YOU JUST HIT ME?

24:35.545 --> 24:38.477
OH, DEAR GOD!

24:38.477 --> 24:41.480
ORSON,
YOU'RE STAYING AT MY HOUSE!

24:41.480 --> 24:43.653
(pants)

24:43.653 --> 24:45.254
THERE YOU GO.

24:54.093 --> 24:57.266
I HAVE NO EXPLANATION.
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ME.

24:57.266 --> 24:59.498
I DON'T SLEEPWALK.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.500
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

25:01.500 --> 25:04.503
BUT SEEING AS I HAVE SEEN YOU
NAKED TWICE IN THE LAST WEEK,

25:04.503 --> 25:07.737
I THINK I CAN ASK,
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

25:07.737 --> 25:09.579
I DON'T THINK SO.

25:09.579 --> 25:12.842
I MEAN, BEING OUT OF OUR HOUSE
HAS BEEN A LITTLE WEIRD,

25:12.842 --> 25:14.844
BUT I'M
VERY COMFORTABLE HERE.

25:14.844 --> 25:16.646
CLEARLY.

25:16.646 --> 25:20.519
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WERE
OUT ON THE LAWN,

25:20.519 --> 25:23.052
YOU SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT MIKE.

25:23.052 --> 25:25.124
MIKE?

25:25.124 --> 25:28.527
WHAT, UH, WHAT DID I SAY?

25:28.527 --> 25:30.529
WELL, IT WAS
JUST SORT OF MUTTERING.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.202
WERE YOU HAVING
A DREAM ABOUT HIM?

25:33.202 --> 25:36.035
NO. I-I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.938
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
BECAUSE YOU JUST SAW HIM.

25:38.938 --> 25:42.271
HE MUST BE ON YOUR MIND.
 YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT, SUSAN?

25:42.271 --> 25:45.715
I-I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR US TO MOVE OUT.

25:45.715 --> 25:47.847
YOU CAN'T. YOUR HOUSE
ISN'T FINISHED YET.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.720
NO, THE DOWNSTAIRS
WILL BE READY NEXT WEEK.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.682
WE'LL BE FINE.
 WELL, IF YOU INSIST...

25:52.682 --> 25:56.025
I THINK
IT WILL BE FOR THE BEST.

25:56.025 --> 25:59.759
OKAY, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, UM,
I DO HAVE A TEENAGE DAUGHTER,

25:59.759 --> 26:01.661
SO IF YOU COULD...

26:01.661 --> 26:03.292
BOXERS?

26:03.292 --> 26:05.695
YES. THANKS.

26:15.244 --> 26:16.746
HEY!
 (music playing indistinctly)

26:16.746 --> 26:19.248
COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN
COOPED UP IN THIS HOUSE

26:19.248 --> 26:21.580
SINCE YOU GOT HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.
 (music stops)

26:21.580 --> 26:24.583
LET'S GO OUT
AND HAVE SOME FUN!
 NO, I THINK
I'M GONNA STAY HERE.

26:24.583 --> 26:28.087
I DON'T--I DON'T
WANNA BE A BURDEN.
 CARLOS, I SEE HANDICAPPED PEOPLE
OUT AND ABOUT ALL THE TIME.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.589
IN FACT, I MET
TWO FEISTY MEN IN WHEELCHAIRS

26:30.589 --> 26:33.092
YESTERDAY AT THE MALL.
THEY WERE LIVING THEIR LIVES...

26:33.092 --> 26:35.865
(singsong voice) SO IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO LIVE YOURS.

26:35.865 --> 26:37.927
COME ON. COME ON.

26:43.202 --> 26:46.636
I'M JUST DROPPING OFF
A FEW LETTERS.

26:46.636 --> 26:49.038
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST WAIT HERE.

26:59.649 --> 27:01.651
JUST PICKING UP
SOME VITAMINS.

27:01.651 --> 27:03.823
I'LL BE QUICKER
IF I DO IT MYSELF.

27:12.001 --> 27:15.004
I JUST HAVE TO DROP OFF
A GIFT TO MY MANICURIST.

27:15.004 --> 27:17.707
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN
TO THE RADIO?

27:24.744 --> 27:26.776
(door bells jingle)
 (Gabrielle) THANK YOU.

27:28.748 --> 27:32.051
SORRY, BABE. THAT TOOK
A LITTLE LONGER THAN I...

27:34.223 --> 27:35.925
CARLOS?

27:38.227 --> 27:39.929
CARLOS?

27:41.931 --> 27:44.193
CARLOS?!

27:44.193 --> 27:47.036
CARLOS!

27:47.036 --> 27:48.798
CARLOS!

27:48.798 --> 27:51.340
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

27:51.340 --> 27:52.872
THANKS, HENRY.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.777
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?
 I WAS STARVING,

27:57.777 --> 28:00.780
SO I GOT THAT KID TO TAKE ME
TO GO GET A BURGER.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.813
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
I WAS WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU!

28:03.813 --> 28:06.816
I'M SICK OF WAITING HERE!
YOU PROMISED ME A FUN DAY,

28:06.816 --> 28:09.819
AND ALL I GOT IS A SUNBURN
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY FACE.

28:09.819 --> 28:12.822
I'M SORRY. I TOLD YOU,
I HAD ERRANDS TO RUN FIRST.

28:12.822 --> 28:14.824
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
 WHAT SMELL?

28:14.824 --> 28:17.426
IT SMELLS LIKE...

28:17.426 --> 28:19.999
NAIL POLISH.
DID YOU GET YOUR NAILS DONE?

28:19.999 --> 28:22.001
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING?

28:22.001 --> 28:24.303
(horn honks)
 (man) EXCUSE ME. MISS!

28:24.303 --> 28:27.206
IS THAT YOUR ASTON MARTIN
IN THE HANDICAPPED SPACE?

28:27.206 --> 28:30.439
WHAT? GABY, ARE YOU PARKED
IN A HANDICAPPED SPOT?

28:30.439 --> 28:34.784
MOVE IT ALONG, POPS.
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE A WHILE.

28:34.784 --> 28:37.987
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DID YOU GET A HANDICAPPEDTAG?

28:37.987 --> 28:41.490
TO ANSWER YOUR EARLIER QUESTION,
YES, I GOT A MANICURE.

28:41.490 --> 28:43.492
I'M SORRY. ARE WE GOOD?

28:43.492 --> 28:45.795
OH, MY GOD!

28:45.795 --> 28:47.827
YOU'RE EXPLOITING
MY BLINDNESS

28:47.827 --> 28:49.728
SO THAT YOU CAN SCORE
BETTER PARKING?!

28:49.728 --> 28:52.001
THAT'S A REALLY MEAN WAY
TO PUT IT.

28:52.001 --> 28:54.033
YOU HAD ME OUT HERE,

28:54.033 --> 28:57.837
SITTING LIKE A DOG
WITH THE WINDOW CRACKED OPEN.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.840
YOU USED ME!
 WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T I GET
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS?

29:00.840 --> 29:04.143
YOU KNOW, THE BLINDNESS
DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN TO YOU.
 YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.015
OH, YOU BET I AM!

29:06.015 --> 29:08.017
EVERY MORNING,
THE TOOTHPASTE HAS TO BE

29:08.017 --> 29:10.749
TO THE LEFT OF THE SINK,
BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT,

29:10.749 --> 29:13.322
YOU CAN'T FIND IT,
AND I HAVE TO PUT IT THERE.

29:13.322 --> 29:16.085
AND--AND SOMETIMES--
I DON'T KNOW--I'M DRIVING,

29:16.085 --> 29:18.087
OR I'M IN LINE AT THE BANK

29:18.087 --> 29:20.759
AND I THINK,
"IS THE TOOTHPASTE THERE?"

29:20.759 --> 29:23.762
(voice breaking) SO THEN
I HAVE TO RUN HOME AND CHECK

29:23.762 --> 29:25.764
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
REACHING FOR THE TUBE

29:25.764 --> 29:29.498
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND IT.
I JUST DIDN'T THINK

29:29.498 --> 29:32.771
THIS WAS HOW IT WAS
ALL GONNA TURN OUT, CARLOS.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.774
I DIDN'T THINK THAT EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

29:35.774 --> 29:38.848
A PART OF ME IS ALWAYS GONNA
THINK, "WHERE'S THE TOOTHPASTE?"

29:38.848 --> 29:41.951
CAN'T YOU JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE DRAWER?

29:41.951 --> 29:44.814
THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
YOU BLIND IDIOT!

29:44.814 --> 29:46.515
I'M SAYING

29:46.515 --> 29:49.518
IF ALL I GET IN EXCHANGE
FOR THIS CRAPPY SITUATION

29:49.518 --> 29:52.021
IS A NICE PARKING SPOT
FOR MY $8 MANICURE,

29:52.021 --> 29:54.463
THEN I'M TAKING IT!

30:03.973 --> 30:06.335
(woman) YOU WANNA BE CAREFUL
WITH THOSE BURNERS.

30:06.335 --> 30:10.409
(man) GET ON THE FINAL
FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS, WILL YA?

30:10.409 --> 30:13.342
WHO PUT PEAR SLICES
IN THE WALDORF SALAD?

30:13.342 --> 30:15.414
GUESS THAT WOULD BE ME.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.287
KATHERINE, A WALDORF SALAD
IS MADE WITH APPLES.

30:18.287 --> 30:19.818
IT'S TRADITION.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.251
YES, A MUSTY,
19th CENTURY TRADITION

30:22.251 --> 30:24.253
IN NEED OF SOME JAZZING UP.

30:24.253 --> 30:27.196
LOOK, I JUST THOUGHT YOU HAVE
SO MUCH ON YOUR MIND ALREADY,

30:27.196 --> 30:29.498
WHAT WITH THE MUSIC
AND THE DECORATIONS.

30:29.498 --> 30:33.202
THE LEAST I COULD DO
WAS TAKE OVER THE FOOD.
 "TAKE OVER"?

30:33.202 --> 30:36.405
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY FRENCH ONION SOUP?

30:36.405 --> 30:38.908
OH, IT'LL BE FINE.
I TOLD THE CHEF

30:38.908 --> 30:42.411
NOTHING IS TO LEAVE THAT KITCHEN
UNLESS I'VE TASTED IT.

30:42.411 --> 30:44.373
KATHERINE--
 TRUST ME.

30:44.373 --> 30:45.514
AFTER ALL,

30:45.514 --> 30:48.277
I'VE GOTTEN TONS OF COMPLIMENTS
ON THE LISIANTHUS.

30:52.281 --> 30:53.622
(scoffs)

30:56.255 --> 30:59.328
(sighing)

31:06.865 --> 31:09.498
HERE, HONEY. LET ME.

31:15.304 --> 31:17.276
THANKS.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.148
YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:25.054 --> 31:26.515
JUST SO YOU KNOW...

31:28.557 --> 31:31.420
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT
I'M PUTTING YOU THROUGH.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.465
IF IT WERE ANYONE BUT YOU,
IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT.

31:41.670 --> 31:43.032
(sighs)

31:43.032 --> 31:45.604
YOU READY
TO GO TO THE PARTY?

31:45.604 --> 31:48.277
YOU TELL ME.

31:48.277 --> 31:51.110
(sighs) HOW DO I LOOK?

31:53.042 --> 31:56.315
(sighs)
YOU LOOK VERY HANDSOME.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.487
THANK YOU.

31:58.487 --> 32:00.990
AND YOU LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN EVER.

32:00.990 --> 32:04.423
(laughs)
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.225
JUST A HUNCH.

32:06.225 --> 32:08.697
HMM.

32:08.697 --> 32:12.331
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

32:12.331 --> 32:14.333
BUP, BUP, BUP!
DON'T EAT THAT.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.335
WE HAD
A REFRIGERATION PROBLEM,

32:16.335 --> 32:18.337
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING SICK.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.170
OH, DEAR. WELL,
I SHOULD THROW THIS DIP OUT.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.172
THANKS.
IT'LL BE ABOUT TEN MINUTES

32:23.172 --> 32:25.444
BEFORE I CAN MAKE UP
A NEW BATCH.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.446
DO YOU MIND
TELLING YOUR BOSS?

32:27.446 --> 32:31.020
(under breath)
SHE'SNOTMY BOSS!

32:31.020 --> 32:34.023
(gasps) BREE!
THE ROOM IS SIMPLY LOVELY.

32:34.023 --> 32:35.954
YOU'VE OUTDONE YOURSELF.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.456
THANK YOU, MRS. DOWNING.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.728
LISTEN, WHEN I PRESENT
THE FOUNDER'S AWARD TONIGHT,

32:39.728 --> 32:42.731
I WAS WONDERING--
 OH, DEAR.
HAS NO ONE SPOKEN TO YOU?

32:42.731 --> 32:44.393
ABOUT WHAT?
 UH, WELL...

32:44.393 --> 32:47.096
THE COMMITTEE HAS DECIDED
THAT IT WOULD BE BEST

32:47.096 --> 32:49.498
IF KATHERINE MAYFAIR
PRESENT THE AWARD THIS YEAR.

32:49.498 --> 32:52.441
NO! THAT'S... (scoffs)
THAT'SMYJOB. I ALWAYS DO IT.

32:52.441 --> 32:55.144
OH, WELL,
YOU'RE ALREADY DOING SO MUCH,

32:55.144 --> 32:59.248
AND, WELL, KATHERINE WAS
QUITE INSISTENT. (chuckles)

33:03.452 --> 33:04.753
WHAT'S THAT?

33:04.753 --> 33:08.417
OH, IT'S DIP.
THE CATERER JUST SAID THAT--
 I THOUGHT WE AGREED.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.190
NOTHING LEAVES THE KITCHEN
WITHOUT ME TASTING IT FIRST.

33:14.563 --> 33:17.396
DIG IN.

33:24.733 --> 33:27.736
(piano playing jazz)

33:27.736 --> 33:30.739
(indistinct conversations)

33:33.482 --> 33:35.414
IS EVERYONE HAVING FUN?

33:35.414 --> 33:37.546
YOU AND KATHERINE
DID AN AMAZING JOB.

33:37.546 --> 33:40.489
BOY, WE DIDN'T THINK
YOU GUYS COULD WORK TOGETHER.

33:40.489 --> 33:43.552
YEAH, WE WERE SURE ONE OF YOU
WOULD END UP KILLING THE OTHER.

33:48.057 --> 33:50.559
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE
MORE FAITH IN PEOPLE.

33:50.559 --> 33:53.262
EXCUSE ME.

33:53.262 --> 33:57.536
(Katherine gagging and coughing)

33:59.408 --> 34:01.710
KATHERINE, DARLING,
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:01.710 --> 34:03.242
(sighs)

34:03.242 --> 34:05.374
(toilet flushes)

34:05.374 --> 34:07.246
NOT REALLY.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.248
OH. I HOPE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE FOOD.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.321
IS ANYBODY ELSE GETTING SICK?

34:12.321 --> 34:13.782
OH, NO.

34:13.782 --> 34:15.484
NO, DEAR. JUST YOU.

34:15.484 --> 34:17.826
(sighs)
 MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

34:17.826 --> 34:21.460
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO PRESENT
THE FOUNDER'S AWARD.

34:21.460 --> 34:25.364
OH, NO ONE WOULD EXPECT YOU
TO DO THAT IN YOUR CONDITION.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.696
YOU KNOW WHAT?
UM, I COULD DO IT.

34:27.696 --> 34:30.498
NO. I CAN GET IT TOGETHER.

34:30.498 --> 34:33.302
KATHERINE, NO ONE EXPECTS YOU
TO BE A MARTYR.

34:33.302 --> 34:35.543
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?
 (sighs) I CAN'T.

34:35.543 --> 34:37.346
WHY NOT? I'M PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF PRESENTING.

34:37.346 --> 34:39.348
I'VE DONE IT
FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.

34:39.348 --> 34:41.350
(chuckles)
AND LET'S FACE IT.

34:41.350 --> 34:43.812
I MEAN, NO ONE WANTS TO ACCEPT
AN AWARD FROM A WOMAN

34:43.812 --> 34:46.715
WHO LOOKS LIKE SHE SHOULD BE
IN LINE AT THE NEEDLE EXCHANGE.

34:46.715 --> 34:50.088
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.
I'LL BE FINE.

34:53.522 --> 34:56.824
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

34:56.824 --> 34:58.497
(applause)

34:58.497 --> 35:02.601
AND NOW FOR THE PRESENTATION
FOR THE FOUNDER'S AWARD--

35:02.601 --> 35:04.833
MS. KATHERINE MAYFAIR.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.515
THANK YOU, MRS. DOWNING.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.816
(camera shutter clicks)

35:17.816 --> 35:19.688
I WAS HONORED

35:19.688 --> 35:22.191
WHEN YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS
OF THE COMMITTEE

35:22.191 --> 35:25.154
ASKED ME TO PRESENT THIS AWARD.

35:25.154 --> 35:28.597
"I WAS HONORED WHEN YOU..."
MYEAH, MYEAH, MYEAH, MYEAH.
 BREE, WHAT'S UP?

35:28.597 --> 35:31.300
I THOUGHT GIVING OUT
THIS AWARD WAS YOUR THING.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.303
USED TO BE. NOT ANYMORE.
THINGS CHANGE.

35:34.303 --> 35:37.566
THIS YEAR'S FOUNDER'S AWARD...

35:37.566 --> 35:39.868
EVER SINCE I STARTED WORKING
WITH THAT OBNOXIOUS BACKSTABBER,

35:39.868 --> 35:42.871
SHE'S DONE NOTHING BUT TRY
TO TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT OFF OF ME

35:42.871 --> 35:45.614
AND PUT IT ONTO HER.

35:45.614 --> 35:48.677
GOES TO MY DEAR FRIEND...
BREE HODGE.

35:52.481 --> 35:57.155
THE OBNOXIOUS BACKSTABBER
JUST CALLED YOUR NAME.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.496
BREE HAS BEEN A PILLAR
OF THE FAIRVIEW COMMUNITY

36:07.496 --> 36:09.268
FOR MANY YEARS.

36:09.268 --> 36:14.172
THERE IS NO BETTER FRIEND
THAN BREE HODGE.

36:15.604 --> 36:17.306
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:17.306 --> 36:18.647
(chuckles)

36:18.647 --> 36:21.310
(under breath) I KNOW
YOU TRIED TO POISON ME.

36:28.317 --> 36:30.188
WELL, UH,

36:30.188 --> 36:33.662
THIS HAS BEEN
AN EVENING FULL OF, UM...

36:38.327 --> 36:40.329
SURPRISES. UH...

36:40.329 --> 36:41.630
(cell phone rings)

36:41.630 --> 36:44.433
I NEVER WOULD'VE IMAGINED
THAT, UM,

36:44.433 --> 36:46.735
I WOULD BE RECOGNIZED BY
THIS WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION ...
 (ring)

36:46.735 --> 36:48.837
HI, ANDREW. GUESS WHAT?

36:48.837 --> 36:51.510
YOUR MOM JUST WON
THE FOUNDER'S AWARD.
 Lynette, listen to me.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.412
(siren wailing in distance)
 OH, MY GOD.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.815
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE.
 WHAT? WHAT? IS EVERYONE OKAY?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.887
UH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE--WE'RE FINE.

36:58.887 --> 37:00.889
IT'S RICK'S PLACE--
TOTALLY WENT UP IN FLAMES.

37:00.889 --> 37:02.891
THERE, UH, THERE ARE, LIKE,
THREE FIRE TRUCKS HERE.

37:02.891 --> 37:06.224
OH, MY GOD! THAT'S HORRIBLE!
HOW DID IT START?

37:06.224 --> 37:07.896
I--THEY--THEY DON'T KNOW.

37:07.896 --> 37:10.899
OKAY, I-I'M GONNA--I'LL CALL YOU
BACK IN ABOUT FIVE. BYE.

37:10.899 --> 37:13.502
(Bree)
I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH

37:13.502 --> 37:17.306
FOR PRESENTING ME
WITH THIS AWARD. I...

37:17.306 --> 37:20.839
I CERTAINLY, UH,
WASN'T EXPECTING IT.

37:20.839 --> 37:24.573
UM, WE HAVE A SMALL CITY
WITH A GREAT, BIG HEART,

37:24.573 --> 37:27.446
AND I AM HONORED
TO, UH, ACCEPT THIS AWARD

37:27.446 --> 37:30.649
FROM MY DEAR FRIEND...

37:42.331 --> 37:44.333
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

37:44.333 --> 37:45.934
THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S ASKING

37:45.934 --> 37:48.937
IF HE CAN GET SHOTS
OF THE TWO OF US.

37:48.937 --> 37:51.440
WAIT.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.742
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FIRST.

37:53.742 --> 37:55.944
(chuckles)

37:55.944 --> 37:58.006
I MISUNDERSTOOD THE SITUATION,
THAT'S ALL.

37:58.006 --> 38:00.008
CAN WE JUST LEAVE IT
AT THAT?

38:00.008 --> 38:01.980
NO, WE CAN'T.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.282
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

38:04.282 --> 38:06.815
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THINGS WERE GOING WELL.

38:06.815 --> 38:09.788
I WAS HAVING FUN WITH YOU.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.821
OBVIOUSLY...

38:12.821 --> 38:14.963
IMISUNDERSTOOD.

38:14.963 --> 38:17.496
SO TELL ME,

38:17.496 --> 38:20.799
WAS THERE A STRAW
THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK?

38:20.799 --> 38:23.672
OR WERE YOU PLANNING
ON KILLING ME ALL ALONG?

38:25.704 --> 38:27.005
(chuckles) HERE'S THE THING

38:27.005 --> 38:29.838
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
ABOUT ME AND MY FRIENDS.

38:29.838 --> 38:31.840
WE EACH HAVE OUR NICHE.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.912
GABRIELLE'S
THE GLAMOROUS ONE.

38:33.912 --> 38:37.786
SUSAN'S THE ADORABLE ONE.
LYNETTE'S SMART.

38:37.786 --> 38:39.087
EDIE'S... EDIE.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.790
AND I'M THE DOMESTIC ONE,
THE ORGANIZER--

38:41.790 --> 38:45.424
THE ONE WHO KNOWS THAT THERE ARE
THREE TINES ON A DESSERT FORK.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.827
I'M THE ONE WHO GETS TEASED
FOR THAT. THAT'S WHOIAM.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.703
AND THAT'S ALSO WHOYOUARE.
(chuckles)

38:54.703 --> 38:55.934
SO?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.806
SO...

38:57.806 --> 39:01.740
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
 HOWTO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU.

39:03.412 --> 39:05.944
THAT'S A SHAME...

39:05.944 --> 39:09.077
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER
THAN ALL THOSE OTHER WOMEN DO.

39:09.077 --> 39:13.021
I KNOW
HOW FOLLOWING THE RULES

39:13.021 --> 39:15.784
AND OBSERVING
THE LITTLE GRACES

39:15.784 --> 39:18.086
MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

39:18.086 --> 39:20.759
WE'VE BOTH HAD DAYS
WHERE IT WAS EITHER

39:20.759 --> 39:22.931
SET A BEAUTIFUL TABLE

39:22.931 --> 39:25.434
OR CURL UP IN A BALL
AND DIE.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.938
WE'RE THE SAME, BREE.

39:29.938 --> 39:32.941
AND IF YOU THINK THAT MEANS
WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS,

39:32.941 --> 39:34.903
THEN I'M SORRY.

39:34.903 --> 39:37.906
BUT IT MIGHT ALSO MEAN
WE COULD BE BEST FRIENDS.

39:42.511 --> 39:44.513
WHO KNEW
YOU WERE SO INSIGHTFUL?

39:48.887 --> 39:50.559
ISN'T LEARNING FUN?

39:50.559 --> 39:52.561
(both chuckle)

39:55.894 --> 39:57.395
(camera shutter clicks)

39:57.395 --> 39:59.528
TERRIFIC, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU.

39:59.528 --> 40:01.730
(sighs) PICTURES.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.532
(both giggle)

40:03.532 --> 40:06.675
SO... DID I LIE?
WAS IT COOL?

40:06.675 --> 40:08.877
YOU WERE RIGHT.
IT REALLY WAS.

40:08.877 --> 40:10.879
(chuckles)

40:10.879 --> 40:12.881
"THANK YOU, JULIE."
 OH.

40:12.881 --> 40:16.885
IT'S GOOD TO GET OUT
OF MY OWN HEAD, YOU KNOW?

40:16.885 --> 40:19.888
FOR MONTHS NOW, I'VE BEEN
HUNG UP ON LOOKING FOR MY DAD

40:19.888 --> 40:21.550
AND BLAMING MY MOM...

40:21.550 --> 40:24.693
(sighs)
AND IT'S GOTTEN ME NOWHERE.

40:24.693 --> 40:26.995
I JUST WANNA
START HAVING FUN AGAIN.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.059
THANK YOU, JULIE.

40:31.059 --> 40:32.831
(both giggle)
 (Katherine) THERE YOU ARE.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.063
WE WANTED TO GET
SOME PICTURES WITH YOU.
 MM.

40:35.063 --> 40:39.007
OH. (giggles)

40:39.007 --> 40:41.770
(camera shutter clicking)

40:41.770 --> 40:42.941
(chuckles)

40:54.953 --> 40:56.655
ORSON.

40:59.027 --> 41:01.790
HI. UM... LISTEN,
I-I HAVE A 12:00 CURFEW,

41:01.790 --> 41:03.792
SO IF MY MOM ASKS,
CAN YOU JUST--

41:03.792 --> 41:06.034
MIKE?

41:06.034 --> 41:08.096
NO, IT'S JULIE.

41:10.639 --> 41:13.872
OH, YOU'RE SLEEPWALKING.
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.975
I'M SORRY, MIKE.

41:16.975 --> 41:20.208
AGAIN, NOT MIKE.

41:20.208 --> 41:22.911
WHY DON'T I-I GET YOU
BACK TO BED,

41:22.911 --> 41:24.212
AND--AND YOU CAN--

41:24.212 --> 41:26.915
I'M SORRY I RAN YOU OVER,
MIKE.

41:40.028 --> 41:41.530
BLINDNESS--

41:41.530 --> 41:44.032
IT'S AN AFFLICTION
THAT PREVENTS PEOPLE

41:44.032 --> 41:46.975
FROM SEEING WHAT IS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM...

41:49.608 --> 41:52.240
LIKE THE WIVES
WHO CAN'T DETECT THE JEALOUSY

41:52.240 --> 41:55.143
THAT CONSUMES THEIR HUSBANDS...

41:57.816 --> 42:02.991
THE WOMEN UNABLE TO SEE
THAT A RIVAL MIGHT ALSO

42:02.991 --> 42:04.923
BE A FRIEND...

42:06.855 --> 42:08.857
THE MEN WHO STAY OBLIVIOUS

42:08.857 --> 42:13.101
TO THE GUILT
THAT LIES DEEP WITHIN THEM.

42:14.803 --> 42:17.836
YES...

42:17.836 --> 42:22.641
THE WORLD IS FILLED
WITH THOSE WHO CANNOT SEE.

42:22.641 --> 42:26.815
THE MOST DANGEROUS
ARE THE ONES WHO STAY BLIND

42:26.815 --> 42:30.949
TO THE EVIL
WITHIN THEIR OWN HEARTS.

42:30.949 --> 42:35.123
HOW DO WE PROTECT OURSELVES
FROM THESE PEOPLE?

42:35.123 --> 42:38.987
FIRST, WE HAVE TO OPEN
OUR OWN EYES AND FIND THEM...

42:40.829 --> 42:42.831
BEFORE THEY FINDUS.
