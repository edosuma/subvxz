00:30.564 --> 00:31.564
Watch!

00:31.865 --> 00:32.957
It's falling!

00:33.233 --> 00:34.894
Ahhh!

00:53.120 --> 00:54.280
We only found six.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.853
Yeah well, what're gonna do?

00:55.989 --> 00:58.355
He said there would be seven
chests of treasure on board.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.956
We have to find the seventh.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.321
Here's the seventh.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.593
Skuddle her then.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.822
Skuddle her!

01:08.168 --> 01:09.328
She's done!

01:14.107 --> 01:15.972
Mercy. Please.

01:16.043 --> 01:17.567
Get yourself aboard.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.108
Your rum's here.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.646
Come on, move, lads. Let's move!

02:09.795 --> 02:12.731
Hurry it up. We'll all drown
if you're not quick about it

02:18.171 --> 02:19.171
porky!

02:19.706 --> 02:21.731
I can't hold on for long

02:30.651 --> 02:32.448
jump in the lot of you!

03:03.150 --> 03:05.880
We stowed seven chests
just as you said, sir.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.671
We didn't need to give him all seven

03:29.176 --> 03:31.405
we could have kept one
chest for ourselves.

03:31.406 --> 03:33.636
And have 'em turn
the British Navy after us?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.178
You want a rope 'round
your neck do ya, Porky?

03:53.633 --> 03:54.691
James Hargreaves?

03:54.835 --> 03:55.835
Mother of God!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.167
Quiet now, lad.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.396
Captain Johnson!

03:58.839 --> 04:01.569
I'd heard tell you were back
The town's in a tizzy.

04:01.775 --> 04:06.576
So say my men. What the devil
was going on out at the point earlier?

04:07.280 --> 04:09.009
His men took a ship's treasure and.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.446
And drowned all aboard. I know

04:10.917 --> 04:14.045
I need you to show me
just where they were.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.547
Will you do it?
To night?

04:17.124 --> 04:20.116
When I've finished me chores
I'll be quick as I can!

04:39.012 --> 04:41.105
The tide allows you
in only twice a year.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.177
Otherwise it's a surge in under there.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.078
Struck the water when they
were building the foundation of it.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.916
That's how he knew about it. There.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.790
Damn me

04:50.957 --> 04:54.916
I saw a formation like
that once south of Krakatoa.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.095
Magical. Perfect

04:59.032 --> 05:01.000
I'll have to be quick to catch her.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.534
Catch her. Why?
That's his ship.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.066
Aye, it is, and he runs it rough
shod over our earth for his profit

05:09.476 --> 05:12.104
showing no concern
for the plight of man.

05:12.345 --> 05:17.647
He needs a comeuppance,
James, him up there, him and his ilk.

05:17.884 --> 05:21.650
There's no room for those
pitiless gentlemen in this life, lad.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.220
They have their law

05:23.390 --> 05:24.652
I have mine.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.886
He'll pay for what he takes
What is, is.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.621
Mark me what is, is!

05:35.001 --> 05:36.001
Skedaddle now.

05:36.002 --> 05:36.535
Thank you

05:36.536 --> 05:37.503
God be with you.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.040
Watch that horizon in an hour or two

05:40.041 --> 05:42.372
I'll light up the sky for you.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.894
An hour we'll be broadside of her.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.893
Prepare the men, Mr. Syce.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.678
Break loose the cannon
We'll blanket her to port.

06:30.624 --> 06:34.060
At the water line. Aim to sink her.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.027
Sink her?

06:35.028 --> 06:41.024
Sink her. We'll let them see what a
how do you do with Davy Jones is like

06:41.234 --> 06:43.395
aim to sink her.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.473
Ready

06:47.707 --> 06:48.731
ready!

06:50.043 --> 06:51.043
Fire

06:51.044 --> 06:52.204
fire!

07:29.316 --> 07:32.444
You sank 'em, Sir. Without mercy.

07:32.852 --> 07:36.088
You didn't hear their
merciless talk, Mister Syce.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.149
Them's Seamen that don't belong in
the Brotherhood of Pirates.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.859
They belong in Hell.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.028
Them and their
wretched master up there.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.788
And I hope he saw it all.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.032
We'll not be back in Grey Rocks then.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.498
Heh...

07:49.803 --> 07:52.033
There'd be few who'd welcome us

07:52.772 --> 07:54.205
South, south west

07:56.076 --> 07:57.976
south, south west!

08:04.250 --> 08:07.276
Will this voyage of yours
ever end, sir?

08:07.520 --> 08:10.045
I signed on for centuries, Mr. Syce.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.124
It's my god given task.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.719
Consider yourself lucky it's not yours.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.490
You're fond of that port, Mr. Syce.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.098
Aye, Captain, that I am.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.393
As am I, Mr. Syce. As am I.

08:23.803 --> 08:27.739
And it'll be a work of great passion
when its time for me comes to pass

08:28.375 --> 08:30.172
but it's not calling me now.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.913
Not yet. In a century or two, m'thinks.

08:34.147 --> 08:38.015
When the wind with the name of Grey
Rocks' on it brings me in there.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.188
Bye Mom.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.756
Bye Meg.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.667
Caw! Caw!

09:50.190 --> 09:51.714
Morning Jim.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.823
Good morning, Mr. Freelove!

10:00.033 --> 10:01.330
Mornin' Jim.

10:17.851 --> 10:18.851
Hi, uncle Robin.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.109
You're late for school.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.015
First bell hasn't gone yet.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.914
You going up home for breakfast?

10:23.990 --> 10:25.719
Cup of coffee, maybe.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.457
Mother's made pancakes.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.122
A milkshake for breakfast?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.927
It's supper, just finished my shift.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.328
Now you're late.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.430
See ya.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.049
This month, she won't make it.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.311
Can't make it
Doesn't have the wherewithal.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.186
Then it'll be ours.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.381
You're just going
to pour money into it.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.526
Then it'll pour money into me.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.093
My father doesn't think so.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.092
Your father's a Presbyterian minister.

11:05.231 --> 11:08.034
The most he knows about money
is from a collection plate.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.832
That's going to be
a Resort Hotel, Mona

11:11.037 --> 11:13.528
I'm going to turn this
town in to a paradise.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.765
Everybody's going to come here
I'll make a killing!

11:19.012 --> 11:20.012
Where's the dog?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.181
He follows Todd to school.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.698
Two topics, kids One.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.801
Nova Scotia and Confederation.

11:45.004 --> 11:50.032
Why do some Nova Scotian flags fly at
half mast on Dominion Day July First?

11:50.109 --> 11:53.772
Why did the nova
Scotian Assembly in 1868

11:53.947 --> 11:56.177
- vote to withdraw from Confederation.
- Stop it.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.078
And why has it
never been rescinded?

11:59.319 --> 12:04.450
Or two Pirates in Nova Scotia
Scourge or Saviors?

12:04.591 --> 12:07.651
I want a report on one of
these two topics in two weeks.

12:07.827 --> 12:08.919
Five pages

12:09.429 --> 12:10.429
no!

12:10.430 --> 12:14.799
No, Master Hawkins? Really? No?
You won't do the assignment?

12:15.034 --> 12:16.729
Is it because you've run out of ink?

12:19.005 --> 12:20.063
Clean it up.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.406
May I help Jim clean his desk up?

12:24.711 --> 12:26.178
Yes, indeed you may

12:26.646 --> 12:27.646
Todd?

12:28.047 --> 12:29.105
Yes, sir?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.109
You may clean up the floor.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.249
He's determined to take
this place away from me

12:41.427 --> 12:43.520
Roy Moehner's a determined man.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.994
He's angling to get the whole
town and from what I hear

12:45.999 --> 12:48.229
he might just get it if
he plays his cards right

12:49.936 --> 12:51.062
Meg?

12:51.804 --> 12:52.804
Any coffee left?

12:52.972 --> 12:54.064
On the counter

12:56.009 --> 12:57.101
I'll get it.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.071
Did I say something to offend her?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.704
Heavens, no.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.110
It's because it's the morning and
the girl's spent all night dreaming

13:04.117 --> 13:05.846
she's gadding about in Dublin or Paris

13:06.052 --> 13:08.452
or someplace fancy and
she can't seem to manage

13:08.655 --> 13:10.987
to get herself back to Grey
Rocks till around noon.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.454
Tell her next time
she goes on a trip over there

13:13.693 --> 13:17.163
to take a lesson on how to
make coffee. This is awful

13:17.164 --> 13:18.630
Robin Hawkins!

13:20.667 --> 13:23.500
Saw Jim. He seems cheerier

13:23.770 --> 13:26.739
not really. Seven years now Bill's gone

13:27.106 --> 13:28.368
and he suffers the loss of him

13:28.608 --> 13:30.075
like it was the day they told us.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.702
For Bill's sake

13:31.944 --> 13:34.105
we can't let roy moehner
have this place.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.074
Can't...

13:39.152 --> 13:41.882
Why did you go and get
yourself killed, Bill Hawkins?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.987
What's this poor woman
to do without you?

13:46.025 --> 13:48.323
What in God's name
am I going to do?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.898
I didn't know Nova Scotia
wanted to withdraw from Canada.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.003
That's really dumb
What'd they think we'd do?

13:58.004 --> 14:01.030
My grandmother says
we're a shrimp on a plate of shrimps

14:01.240 --> 14:03.140
but we think we're a lobster.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.107
My dad was Canadian Navy.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.406
He got himself killed for Canada
not for Nova Scotia.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.377
You're going to write your
essay on separation?

14:10.783 --> 14:13.115
Yes. Sure. Better than on pirates.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.553
Pirates come from the sea.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.821
Them and the sea
is what I'm writing about.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.923
You got the Howard Pyle
book from the library?

14:20.159 --> 14:22.127
He did the drawings for Robin Hood

14:22.495 --> 14:24.588
I know. I gotta go do my chores.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.827
See you later, alligator.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.761
In a while, crocodile.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.308
Good dog, Grendel. Sic him!

14:43.116 --> 14:44.116
Oh no!

14:55.995 --> 14:58.020
AHH!

15:16.015 --> 15:17.073
Jim!

15:17.316 --> 15:20.342
Mrs. Oickle, let me stay
a couple of minutes, please?

15:20.553 --> 15:22.487
The Moehner's dog is trying to kill me.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.180
Grendel?

15:25.558 --> 15:28.288
Grendel. Good dog.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.929
Go home. You hear me?
Home now.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.159
That dog wouldn't hurt you.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.601
Yes, he would. Todd Moehner's
trained him to attack me.

15:40.807 --> 15:44.265
Don't be silly Todd's just upset
because he failed last year.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.841
You go home now, sweetie.

15:46.045 --> 15:49.014
Say hi to your mum
Tell her you need new shoes.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.410
What's that all over them?

15:50.550 --> 15:51.881
Todd spilled ink on them.

15:52.016 --> 15:53.063
Ink?

15:53.064 --> 15:54.111
Yeah.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.130
Mom?

16:05.364 --> 16:07.229
Mrs. Oickle says to say hi.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.966
She said to tell you
I need a new pair of shoes.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.831
She would, that one.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.734
She must want those fancy
seamless stockings!

16:15.007 --> 16:16.031
Meg!

16:16.042 --> 16:18.306
Mom, did you know Nova Scotia

16:18.511 --> 16:19.910
wanted to get out of Confederation?

16:20.012 --> 16:21.206
Newfoundland, you mean.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.076
Nova Scotia. In 1868

16:24.750 --> 16:26.240
I smell something burning.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.150
And it's not from the fire you were
supposed to have had lit by now.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.983
Do your chores
boy. People're coming

16:34.794 --> 16:36.591
I'm going to write
an essay about pirates!

16:37.163 --> 16:38.824
Your dad had some books on them

16:39.131 --> 16:41.326
I got this one! It's extraordinary.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.796
Extraordinary?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.368
Howard Pyle! Lots of pictures!

17:02.989 --> 17:04.005
Whoa!

17:04.006 --> 17:05.022
Ah!

17:11.664 --> 17:13.029
Holy cow.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.484
A sailboat! In from off shore!

17:34.754 --> 17:36.153
Put your slicker on!

17:36.389 --> 17:37.856
There's a pirate at the helm!

17:38.124 --> 17:40.087
You've gone off your rocker, boy!

17:40.088 --> 17:42.051
You better get that essay done.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.486
Oh, no!

18:15.027 --> 18:18.292
Give us a hand, lad
grab the line there

18:24.070 --> 18:25.070
James?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.104
Jim, sir

18:26.238 --> 18:27.569
Jim, is it?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.872
Damn me, trick o'the light.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.907
It's your eyes, lad

18:32.111 --> 18:35.147
you got the eyes of a boy
I knew once upon a time.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.047
Thought I was seeing his ghost

18:37.550 --> 18:40.110
cause I see ghosts from time to time.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.286
Happens to fellows
who sail alone at sea.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.057
You know much about ghosts, Jim?

18:46.192 --> 18:48.717
No, sir, not really sir.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.160
Get me warm upstairs

18:51.330 --> 18:54.026
and I'll introduce you to
some of the ghosts I know.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.959
Yes, sir. Yes.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.996
Couple of centuries've
been hard on her.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.639
Sir?

19:00.706 --> 19:02.003
The house up there.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.435
That's our inn.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.143
An inn, is it?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.908
Do you think they'll have
a bed for a seafaring man?

19:08.014 --> 19:09.106
Yes, sir.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.305
And a meal?

19:10.549 --> 19:12.141
My mother's just cooking supper.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.683
Then give us a hand here and we'll.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.081
What fortuitous chance.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.291
Chance?

19:20.426 --> 19:21.723
Aye, lad, chance

19:22.161 --> 19:25.961
I'd set course for Boston
and the storm blew me in here.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.893
What's this place called?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.167
Grey Rocks, sir.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.994
Grey Rocks is it?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.104
Lucky I wasn't on 'em, eh?

19:33.105 --> 19:35.005
I thought you were on 'em for sure

19:42.948 --> 19:44.142
Meg, this is.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.763
Captain Charles Johnson, Ma'am.

19:45.764 --> 19:47.145
Get in here out of the weather.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.082
The two of you'll
freeze the house out.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.629
You're soaked through, Jimmy.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.158
He'll catch his death.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.130
Get yourself dry and changed, son.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.993
The Captain wants to rent a room

20:04.203 --> 20:06.467
I've got the cash to cover my stay.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.971
Get out of those wet things, boy
the young lady's right

20:10.109 --> 20:11.109
Meg, is it?

20:12.078 --> 20:15.639
Yes. She's Meg And I'm
Jim's mother Kerstin Hawkins.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.806
We'd be more than
happy to have you stay.

20:18.784 --> 20:19.876
JIM!!

20:21.087 --> 20:22.145
Do you have a change of clothes?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.379
I'm a duck's back, Mrs. Hawkins.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.993
Since forever. If you could get
my coat dry, that'd satisfy

20:29.962 --> 20:32.089
I'll warm my feet
by the fire, if I may?

20:32.631 --> 20:34.030
Fire's gone out

20:34.266 --> 20:36.131
I can get it going for you.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.240
Fire...

20:49.515 --> 20:50.641
How'd you do that?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.276
I blew on it

20:52.685 --> 20:55.552
I know you blew on it!
But how'd you do it?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.950
How'd you get it to light
like that so fast?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.756
I work with the devil, Meg.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.661
He gives me a hand
from time to time

21:10.436 --> 21:13.030
Robin. Tom
Captain Charles Johnson.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.264
Tom Banks

21:15.474 --> 21:16.566
Robin Hawkins.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.004
You'll need to be seeing my papers.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.046
Not us, Customs.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.077
Before they'll give you
permission to land.

21:24.078 --> 21:26.711
Damn. And I was
just getting warm

21:27.653 --> 21:29.484
I've notified the authorities in Halifax

21:29.688 --> 21:32.521
and we're to confine you here at
the inn 'til they come down Monday.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.516
This isn't a port of entry.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.194
Must leave everything on the boat

21:36.395 --> 21:37.919
Hawkins, is it?

21:38.164 --> 21:41.099
Corporal Hawkins
you're Jim's father?

21:41.534 --> 21:42.694
His uncle.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.803
My husband's ship was
torpedoed by a German U boat.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.165
All hands lost.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.166
Ma'am...

21:52.244 --> 21:55.771
That's the finest piece of sailing
I've seen my whole life.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.812
The whole town's abuzz, Captain.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.508
Am I allowed in town for a hair cut?

22:00.986 --> 22:04.319
Bit embarrassed being here
in this establishment looking like this.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.922
That can't do any harm.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.127
But only the necessaries off
the boat. Til they inspect it.

22:09.962 --> 22:10.962
Hi, Jim.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.828
Hi, Uncle Robin. Mr. Banks.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.066
Who lit the fire?

22:15.167 --> 22:18.136
I did. My bones are ice.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.006
Do you gentlemen mind
if I go back to it?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.440
No, sorry, go ahead. Sit a spell.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.439
You must be froze stiff.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.913
What's your line a'work, Mr. Banks?

22:28.113 --> 22:30.843
Tom. That's my shipyard out there.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.951
He's our harbour master
It was his flare lit you up.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.680
Kerstin
I have to get back to my rounds.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.652
And me to the Missus.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.150
She'll be wondering
where I've got myself to

22:41.360 --> 22:42.588
I've been clear, Captain?

22:42.795 --> 22:44.888
You can go into town
to get cleaned up

22:45.064 --> 22:48.090
but until Immigration permits, you
aren't legally allowed to be ashore.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.432
Absolutely nothing'll
be coming off the boat!

22:51.704 --> 22:53.001
Scout's honour

22:56.108 --> 22:59.009
I'll get supper on its way to you
You must be starved.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.375
Famished, ma'am.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.274
And you?
Your homework done?

23:02.514 --> 23:04.243
I was going to ask
the Captain a question!

23:04.450 --> 23:05.984
Don't be a shilly shally.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.044
Go up and get it done
Supper's nearly ready.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.016
Let me see if I can give a hand.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.087
He has to do it himself.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.526
Sit, lad. If your homework's algebra
you're plumb out of luck.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.955
It's my essay. It's about pirates.

23:21.166 --> 23:25.034
Pirates is it? Modern ones
or the ones from years gone by?

23:25.271 --> 23:26.363
There're modern ones?

23:26.605 --> 23:29.107
Aye, lad. They're the Capitalists.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.805
The profiteers and the tycoons
that get called gentlemen

23:33.045 --> 23:35.980
but pirates is what actually they are.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.851
Oh, boy. Mr. Herkes's
not gonna like that.

23:39.985 --> 23:40.985
Hmff...

23:40.986 --> 23:44.149
So which Pirates do you think your
Mr. Herkes had in mind?

23:44.356 --> 23:46.449
The ones with the treasure
the thieves!

23:46.692 --> 23:47.954
The thieves, is it?

23:48.427 --> 23:51.089
That's not much help
to this old man, son

23:55.000 --> 23:56.160
18th Century?

23:56.402 --> 23:58.870
Better. But if you don't mind

23:59.104 --> 24:01.038
we'll wait a while
before we hand down

24:01.273 --> 24:03.366
judgments about who're the thieves.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.642
Yes, sir.

24:04.643 --> 24:06.110
Captain's dinner's ready, Jim.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.573
Go help your mother with the plates.

24:07.846 --> 24:09.245
- But I was.
- Just going to help your

24:09.415 --> 24:11.076
mother with the plates.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.681
Could I trouble you for a rum?

24:15.921 --> 24:17.889
You'll be drinking a lot of rum?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.181
I hope so.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.094
But don't get that little red
head of yours in a tizzy.

24:22.095 --> 24:24.722
It'll all be paid in full come Monday.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.625
Just mark it down.

24:27.032 --> 24:28.499
Oh, you watch it, you!

24:28.734 --> 24:31.032
My little red" head II
take yours off in a flash!

24:31.270 --> 24:33.830
That'd be an Irish flash, would it?

24:34.006 --> 24:36.975
And no bamboozling that boy! Hear?

24:37.042 --> 24:39.067
I know the kind of man you are!

24:39.311 --> 24:43.008
I just bet you do. The rum, Miss...

24:43.215 --> 24:44.307
O'Leary

24:44.550 --> 24:48.145
O'Leary, is it?
Meg O'Leary

24:56.128 --> 24:58.096
I think she's in love with me!

25:00.632 --> 25:03.226
Shepherd's Pie's perfect
Mrs. Hawkins.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.230
Really hits the spot.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.439
Nothing like a good meal
before you set off on a trip.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.109
You're going away?

25:10.110 --> 25:11.906
No!
Please!

25:12.144 --> 25:14.806
Not me. You and me.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.274
The two of us'll be going.

25:16.275 --> 25:17.081
Oh.

25:17.082 --> 25:17.849
Maybe.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.115
If you eat your peas
finish your food.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.114
Good rum?

25:25.991 --> 25:27.515
You never tasted it?

25:27.726 --> 25:28.943
Heh... No!

25:28.944 --> 25:30.161
You smoke?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.488
NO!

25:32.564 --> 25:34.896
Rum's really good
You want a sip?

25:36.168 --> 25:37.168
No, thank you.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.430
Good decision.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.968
Life's made up of good
and bad decisions.

25:41.607 --> 25:44.405
Try and make as many
of 'em as you can good ones.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.267
You knew I was testing you?

25:46.478 --> 25:47.570
Testing me?

25:47.746 --> 25:51.238
To see if you were going to be a good
enough man to be my ship mate.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.541
Your ship mate?

25:52.785 --> 25:55.151
Don't keep repeating what I say, son.

25:55.454 --> 25:56.716
Clean your plate

25:58.357 --> 26:01.758
I can teach you all you'll need
to know about pirate life and death

26:02.027 --> 26:05.724
but you must understand
that the sea's no silly matter.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.125
What we'll be doin'll be dangerous.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.293
You sure you want
to take lessons from me?

26:10.469 --> 26:11.469
Yes, sir

26:11.470 --> 26:12.869
I'm serious, now!

26:13.105 --> 26:15.630
I'm serious, too. I want to know it all.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.364
My dad loved his pirate books.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.235
Alright, good.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.378
Then look into the fire.

26:23.482 --> 26:26.110
Look deep into it watch, Jim.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.682
Watch the flames dance.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.679
Look deep into them.

26:30.889 --> 26:35.121
See the sun on the water?
Do you see the ship?

26:45.671 --> 26:48.003
Oh my gosh Pirates?

26:57.015 --> 27:01.315
We're in the year 1720
Sixty five, seventy man crew.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.052
Is that the Captain?

27:04.123 --> 27:05.123
Quartermaster.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.258
Elected by the crew So's the Captain.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.586
The two of them.

27:08.827 --> 27:11.921
Captain runs her in battle
quartermaster the rest of the time.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.723
The Brotherhood of the Coast.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.560
Pirates had one of the
very first democracies.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.635
You know what a democracy
is, a true democracy?

27:19.838 --> 27:21.237
A government run by the people?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.042
For the people. All the people.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.236
That's real important.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.105
For all the people. Remember that.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.008
Everybody gets a share in the profit.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.343
Doesn't matter what your pedigree
is nor your religion, nor color.

27:33.552 --> 27:37.420
Every one participates It's all laid
down in a charter they wrote up.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.953
Rules of the Brotherhood.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.888
We'll get this all down
on paper when we get back.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.924
It'll be your lesson to learn.

27:46.798 --> 27:47.958
Whoa.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.574
Rats are every where.

27:57.776 --> 28:01.473
You could never keep a ship dry below
decks no matter how much brimstone

28:01.680 --> 28:03.011
and burning pitch you used.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.312
What if they'd found us?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.711
What is, is, Jim.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.887
What is, is!

28:15.894 --> 28:18.124
Are they burning their ship?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.363
Careening her.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.432
Beach her on a high tide
and scrape off the barnacles.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.032
- It'll increase her speed. Give her.
- jam!

28:25.237 --> 28:26.431
MUM?!

28:27.439 --> 28:29.031
Get to bed.

28:30.509 --> 28:31.806
But it's too early!

28:32.044 --> 28:34.035
You were sound asleep
The two of you.

28:34.112 --> 28:36.205
Take the Captain up to
room ♪2 and settle him in

28:36.415 --> 28:38.508
We'll work out my
account in the morning.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.842
That be alright?

28:40.085 --> 28:41.950
Thank you. That'll be just fine.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.678
Sorry.

28:45.023 --> 28:47.514
Holy cow!
We were in the Caribbean!

28:47.726 --> 28:49.353
With Pirates! On their boat!

28:49.595 --> 28:51.620
Gosh, we're lucky they didn't see us.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.099
But you have to be careful
Next time, who knows?

28:55.267 --> 28:56.700
Maybe they will.

28:56.802 --> 28:57.802
Next time?

28:57.803 --> 28:59.202
You're repeating again.

28:59.304 --> 29:00.304
Sorry.

29:00.305 --> 29:03.866
Don't apologize just don't do it.

29:04.009 --> 29:08.173
Listen. Think. Respond
Take your time.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.815
It'll speed up as you
get used to the process.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.540
That's a rule. Understand?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.343
And mum's the word, alright?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.555
My life here depends
on you keeping it a secret.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.747
Meg'll have me shipped
out, if you don't.

29:19.958 --> 29:23.291
Yes, sir. Listen think respond!

29:23.495 --> 29:26.157
Remember everything
you saw, smelt, heard.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.493
Democracy's for all the people
Write it down.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.232
You go to school at what
nine, tomorrow?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.766
Tomorrow's Saturday. No school.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.840
Ah. I'm going to need
a hand with the boat.

29:38.143 --> 29:40.668
Can you do that
and keep it to yourself?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.105
I'll pay you wages.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.114
You'll pay me?!

29:43.248 --> 29:44.272
Jim!

29:44.750 --> 29:48.516
Listen think respond
Listen think respond!

29:48.987 --> 29:50.045
You don't have to pay me.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.088
A dollar a day. That sound fair?

29:52.090 --> 29:53.352
Holy cow.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.855
Number two.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.027
Such a fine old building.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.295
So many secrets, I bet.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.832
There were spies here
Escaped Slaves from America.

30:04.903 --> 30:05.903
Tunnels in the basement.

30:05.904 --> 30:09.465
Tunnels? Really?
My goodness

30:09.975 --> 30:11.033
Jim.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.474
This is the beginning
of a very long voyage.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.443
You're going to have to keep
all your sea changes to yourself.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.649
Can you do that?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.015
Scout's honour!

30:20.118 --> 30:23.121
Til the morning, Jim. Sleep tight.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.418
Don't let the fleas bite.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.762
Tunnels in the basement you say

30:34.333 --> 30:38.667
I know there are tunnels, lad
and more than that

30:38.970 --> 30:42.133
I know the treasure chests
that're hidin' in 'em!

31:21.446 --> 31:22.606
Here it is.

31:22.681 --> 31:23.681
You got it?

31:23.682 --> 31:24.682
Great.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.681
Yeah. Good, good.

31:27.953 --> 31:28.953
Hmm.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.087
Could I trouble you for a tea?

32:03.088 --> 32:04.988
Sit by the fire
I'll bring you breakfast.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.248
Eggs?
Porridge?

32:06.425 --> 32:07.892
Porridge, please.

32:09.227 --> 32:10.990
It's pounds sterling, ma'am.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.123
You can change it at the bank.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.033
We'll work out the details
when you're.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.365
Captain, my wife Edwina.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.136
Ma'am.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.200
The town's here for b'fast, Meg!
Everyone's come to see him.

32:24.409 --> 32:25.899
The lot of 'em are fools!

32:26.077 --> 32:28.978
He's a snake oil salesman
can't you see?

32:29.314 --> 32:32.249
For me, Meg, please
accommodate him

32:35.053 --> 32:38.079
Harry, this here's Captain Johnson

32:38.089 --> 32:40.489
Charles. Name's Charles.

32:40.725 --> 32:42.750
It's a right pleasure, Charles.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.692
We got a party line and
we heard everything was said.

32:46.865 --> 32:51.427
Some years from now stangers'll
be saying I was there when...

32:53.004 --> 32:56.064
You were looking to get your haircut
Harry's the barber.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.666
Can I come in today?

32:57.909 --> 33:00.377
I'll fit you in. There'll be a crowd.

33:00.612 --> 33:04.048
- Saturday's my day and.
- And they'll be thrilled to see you!

33:04.316 --> 33:06.113
Talk your ear off, they will.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.948
Where do you hail from, Captain?

33:08.086 --> 33:09.086
From the sea.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.783
From the sea, is it?
You a pirate?

33:11.923 --> 33:12.923
Sorry?

33:12.924 --> 33:15.950
This here is pirate county
Oak Island?

33:16.161 --> 33:18.425
Captain Kidd?
Buried treasure?

33:18.630 --> 33:22.896
Local lore says if you asked
a pirate where he was from he'd say

33:23.168 --> 33:24.226
from the sea.

33:24.469 --> 33:25.993
A pirate would, would he?

33:26.371 --> 33:28.066
There you are, young Jim.

33:28.073 --> 33:31.531
Take your breakfast with me
Then we go to work.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.685
Fisherman go out early here, huh?

33:49.895 --> 33:51.988
Not these days. Not 'til dawn.

33:51.997 --> 33:53.021
Humph!

33:54.399 --> 33:55.399
Why?

33:55.567 --> 33:56.567
Was wide awake.

33:56.601 --> 34:00.401
About four. Sea'd calmed down
Up'nd listening at the window.

34:00.605 --> 34:02.664
Couple of boats across the harbor.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.671
Dark as pitch, couldn't see anything.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.970
Funny talk, though
Heard 'em clear as a bell.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.603
Pirates, maybe.

34:22.994 --> 34:26.157
Want to show Customs this when
they come to inspect her Monday.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.561
Leaky board under there.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.692
Need her out of the water
to see what's up with it.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.139
This is what they call
a sea chest? Aye.

34:36.139 --> 34:39.042
And too big to leave in here.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.005
What's behind that iron door there?

34:42.213 --> 34:44.043
You can't take this off the boat?

34:44.049 --> 34:45.072
You're not supposed to.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.712
Them's their rules and all they are
is rules for smugglers and the like

34:48.987 --> 34:50.454
which doesn't apply to us.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.991
So we'll obey 'em by not telling them.

34:52.992 --> 34:54.117
That grate's locked.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.391
You know where the key is?

34:57.829 --> 34:59.228
In the hall closet.

34:59.564 --> 35:00.758
There's a good lad.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.024
- Go grab it.
- But.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.293
What they don't know
won't hurt them.

35:04.669 --> 35:07.638
Not always, mind you
but in this case

35:07.872 --> 35:09.669
yes, it won't hurt them

35:10.175 --> 35:12.973
I'll get the key for you if you
show me what's in the trunk.

35:13.144 --> 35:14.144
What?

35:15.146 --> 35:17.580
You don't want to know
what's in this trunk.

35:18.016 --> 35:19.415
You want me to break the law

35:19.584 --> 35:21.142
I have to know what I'm doing it for.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.150
That's a good lesson
don't you think?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.186
Ah, Jim.

35:36.334 --> 35:37.961
Oh, my gosh!

35:38.470 --> 35:40.836
Careful Don't touch.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.833
Very fragile.

35:43.108 --> 35:44.632
How old are you?

35:47.145 --> 35:48.510
Are you who I think you are?

35:49.080 --> 35:51.082
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh!

35:51.083 --> 35:52.242
Breathe, Jim.

35:53.084 --> 35:55.882
You're Captain Johnson
The same one who wrote.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.087
Breathe, Jim.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.315
Yes, sir That's real?

35:59.557 --> 36:01.025
The Shakespeare Folio there?

36:01.026 --> 36:03.290
And the letters of Marque?
They're yours?

36:03.495 --> 36:04.553
Breathe.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.960
It's not easy to breathe, Captain.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.395
It's not easy at all
I better get the key.

36:09.634 --> 36:13.001
Customs mustn't see this!
Not ever! Nobody must!

36:29.154 --> 36:30.815
This go up to the inn?

36:31.322 --> 36:33.722
Maybe. Don't know for sure.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.289
You don't know?

36:35.527 --> 36:38.724
A boy lives with tunnels and
he doesn't know where they go?

36:38.997 --> 36:41.363
My grandfather said
there were three tunnels.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.999
Said this one we're
in goes way under the kitchen.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.430
There's a rusted shut
door at the end there.

36:46.671 --> 36:47.865
We can't get it open.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.014
There's another tunnel above this
that's used as our root cellar.

36:56.015 --> 36:57.572
It's the house's proper basement.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.011
And the third one?

36:59.484 --> 37:02.317
Strictly out of bounds
I've never seen it.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.683
Listened to it, though
Sounds filled with rushing water.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.124
That what you're looking for here?

37:08.359 --> 37:10.554
In Grey Rocks?
These tunnels?

37:11.696 --> 37:14.927
A dollar a day might not
be enough pay for you.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.431
The boy you took me for?
James?

37:19.070 --> 37:21.038
He was here?
When?

37:24.342 --> 37:25.342
Oh, boy.

37:25.343 --> 37:28.904
Oh, boy. Wow. Gosh!

37:29.114 --> 37:30.809
I warned you.

37:31.449 --> 37:35.408
Captain, when my father died
I thought my life was over.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.087
Right now?
I think it's just beginning!

37:52.003 --> 37:53.527
They'll be covered.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.109
You'll take me to the barber shop?

37:58.110 --> 37:59.235
Sure.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.713
Fire's out. Want me to build one?

38:07.452 --> 38:09.943
No, thank you. What are you doing?

38:10.155 --> 38:11.679
Captain's gonna get a hair cut.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.856
Would you like a cup of tea
before you go, Captain?

38:14.125 --> 38:17.060
No, thank you, ma'am
Just gonna wash my hands.

38:17.929 --> 38:18.987
C'mon, Jim.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.033
They're gettin' awful cozy...

38:23.034 --> 38:26.765
It's for his pirate essay
Jim says he's teaching him things.

38:27.005 --> 38:31.271
There's something amiss there.
I can smell it. Nobody listens but

38:31.509 --> 38:33.670
Roy Moehner's going to
foreclose on the inn.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.272
He's refused our plea
for a loan extension.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.314
He's a bastard!

38:38.850 --> 38:39.850
Oh...

38:54.999 --> 38:56.591
Your mother cry a lot?

38:56.801 --> 38:58.601
Nope. Must've been a bill.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.402
They can make her cry.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.734
That's why she didn't want a fire.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.736
Wood's an extra expense.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.004
We only have a fire Friday
and Saturday nights.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.979
Damn it to hell for that

39:09.214 --> 39:11.978
I'm a landlubber now
I'm frozen up at the inn there

39:12.183 --> 39:13.411
I'll buy the wood.

39:14.118 --> 39:15.847
Talk to her. See what she says.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.750
Humph!
Inn's not paying its way?

39:18.990 --> 39:21.982
No, there's a guy in town
Mr. Moehner.

39:22.627 --> 39:25.289
He holds our mortgage and he's
trying to get the inn away from us.

39:25.797 --> 39:26.957
What's his real name?

39:27.632 --> 39:29.566
That's his real name. Meaner

39:29.801 --> 39:32.861
m o e h n e r.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.572
It looks like moaner
but it's pronounced meaner.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.173
He runs the town
He gets what he wants.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.101
You don't say.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.015
Wait.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.922
Those're the Moehners.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.095
Heel your dog!

40:10.008 --> 40:11.202
Good boy, Grendel!

40:12.277 --> 40:14.905
See you in the school yard, Jeem ee.

40:18.049 --> 40:22.486
That boy there's a bully
Mark his shifty eyes, Jim.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.347
What?
He's bullying you?

40:25.623 --> 40:28.114
All the time. With Grendel.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.993
Grendel?
Grim and greedy Grendel?

40:30.995 --> 40:32.929
They named their
dog after Grendel?

40:33.064 --> 40:36.033
That's its name
Todd trained it to come after me.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.298
It's true!
You saw.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.070
It's their dad that wants the inn.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.198
Dog's all part of his
plot to get us outta there.

40:42.407 --> 40:45.501
If my father were alive
this would've never ever happened.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.075
What about your Uncle Robin?

40:47.312 --> 40:48.643
He's a policeman.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
So?

40:50.114 --> 40:52.947
So unless it's illegal he does nothing.

40:53.151 --> 40:56.279
The talk in town is that the Moehner's
are up to something illegal Just

40:56.487 --> 40:57.487
nobody knows what.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.646
So Uncle Robin says
his hands are tied.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.554
So what?
So nothing.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.053
Hmm... The intrigues of small towns.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.897
Life is not so complicated at sea, Jim.

41:09.267 --> 41:12.236
Huh... Never saw one of these before.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.566
You're who the storm blew in?

41:18.776 --> 41:20.607
Captain Charles Johnson

41:21.045 --> 41:23.013
I thought you weren't
permitted to leave the inn.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.181
They said I could get my haircut.

41:25.650 --> 41:29.882
They did did they Little crawly things
making a nest in there are they?

41:30.154 --> 41:32.315
Safe onward travels to you

41:38.629 --> 41:41.427
I am not going anywhere just yet.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.408
Hi Jim.

41:51.476 --> 41:52.670
Hi Jenny.

41:54.445 --> 41:56.003
Is she your girlfriend?

41:56.447 --> 41:59.007
She's my best friend. And a girl.

41:59.784 --> 42:03.117
You look like the picture
of that Ernest Hemingway.

42:03.788 --> 42:05.847
He wrote about the sea
in Life Magazine

42:06.124 --> 42:08.752
I saw you reading
that magazine in there.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.519
Where I can get some firewood?

42:12.797 --> 42:14.128
Firewood?

42:14.132 --> 42:15.156
Jim!

42:15.400 --> 42:17.027
Listen think respond.

42:17.869 --> 42:18.869
The Hirtles sell it

42:19.070 --> 42:21.664
but if you don't pay them
they'll set your boat on fire.

42:21.839 --> 42:22.965
Hirtles can be mean

42:26.310 --> 42:27.971
I'm starting to like this town.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.080
Your hat's too big for you now.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.744
It keeps my ears warm.

42:37.588 --> 42:40.250
Mr. Moehner, Miss Hamkins is here.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.054
How nice to see you, Kerstin.

42:52.703 --> 42:55.194
You can't lawfully take
my inn away from me!

42:55.473 --> 42:56.531
Not if I make my mortgage payments

42:56.707 --> 42:59.005
and I have until the end
of the month to do that

42:59.610 --> 43:02.602
I know the difficulties you're having
The whole town knows.

43:02.814 --> 43:05.078
It would be so simple
if you'd do as I ask

43:05.683 --> 43:07.207
and restructure my note.

43:07.785 --> 43:09.616
Company's rules won't let me.

43:09.887 --> 43:11.286
You make the rules, Roy Moehner.

43:11.489 --> 43:12.956
And the whole town knows that.

43:13.224 --> 43:17.718
And they all know if you sell
I'll give you a very fair pricelf not

43:17.995 --> 43:21.021
I'll foreclose So sell it to me.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.960
Your Bill would want you to.

43:23.167 --> 43:26.864
That's the last thing my Bill would
want you son of a bitch!

43:27.105 --> 43:29.266
The inn is not for sale. Not to you.

43:29.474 --> 43:31.339
Not now. Not ever!

43:46.224 --> 43:50.126
Captain, I'm sorry but we do not
have fires here in the afternoon.

43:50.128 --> 43:53.529
So Jim told me
But I've got a chill in my bones ma'am

43:54.031 --> 43:56.431
so I've hired the Hirtles
to bring me some cordage.

43:56.767 --> 43:58.098
It'll be my wood

43:58.369 --> 44:01.566
but you're more than welcome
to warm yourself by it if you want

44:02.073 --> 44:05.176
I told Jim to tell him that's not
how you do things around here.

44:05.177 --> 44:06.905
The wind's changed.

44:07.111 --> 44:10.080
We're on a different tack now
Right, Jim?

44:10.681 --> 44:12.205
Seems right to me, mum

44:13.851 --> 44:17.480
Meg, could I trouble you for
a rum and a cup of hot water?

44:19.957 --> 44:21.652
Please put the kettle on, Meg.

44:36.607 --> 44:38.541
You met with Mr. Moehner?

44:39.844 --> 44:43.837
All my life I've believed the enemy
to be the Moehners of this world.

44:44.048 --> 44:46.016
And I've dealt with them as such

44:46.851 --> 44:51.311
I will find a way to sink his ship
ma'am. Believe me.

44:51.989 --> 44:53.923
He will not prevail.

44:56.394 --> 44:59.955
Meg's got my account
Please mark the rum down on it

45:05.903 --> 45:07.996
Jim, we've got a lesson to study.

45:09.006 --> 45:10.473
Can I ask where we're going?

45:11.075 --> 45:12.075
Yes, you can.

45:12.076 --> 45:14.203
Heh heh... where are we going?

45:15.046 --> 45:16.046
Way back

45:16.113 --> 45:19.480
I'm going to teach you about
Surprizals Write it down in your book

45:19.717 --> 45:23.813
s u r p r I z a l.

45:24.255 --> 45:27.713
Viking tactic
Great pirates, the Vikings.

45:27.959 --> 45:29.586
Now look into the fire.

45:54.518 --> 45:55.542
Where are we?

45:56.654 --> 45:58.053
Straits a Dover.

45:58.356 --> 45:59.948
Middle of the eleventh century.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.058
England's over there.

46:02.326 --> 46:03.657
Normandy's there.

46:04.128 --> 46:06.221
Vikings called this the Northern Sea.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.489
Is this the boat they
came to Canada in?

46:08.666 --> 46:12.033
It is. Five hundred years
before Columbus.

46:12.703 --> 46:14.068
Pretty good sailors, huh?

46:16.574 --> 46:17.574
Look.

46:21.112 --> 46:25.811
There's your pirates. She'll point her
stem into this one's aft port quarter

46:26.050 --> 46:30.009
and then on the crest of a wave
they'll board us and the fight'll begin.

46:30.488 --> 46:32.649
They think we've got valuable cargo.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.291
We don't?

46:34.292 --> 46:36.556
Surprizal, Jim. Surprizal.

46:36.994 --> 46:39.189
See the lines dragging
over the stern?

46:39.730 --> 46:41.994
Warps?
To slow her down?

46:42.833 --> 46:46.997
This ship wants to be attacked
See that covered cargo?

46:52.243 --> 46:53.767
That's not cargo!

46:54.078 --> 46:56.046
That's it. Surprizal!

46:56.314 --> 46:59.681
And there's no toilet close
at hand which is too bad

46:59.884 --> 47:02.079
cause it's going to be
brown pants time

47:02.086 --> 47:04.350
for those other fellows
when they come aboard.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.026
Hear 'em?

47:43.160 --> 47:45.560
That's their god Odin
they're calling out to.

47:45.796 --> 47:49.129
They're yelling for him to let them
be in Valhalla when they die.

47:56.173 --> 47:58.004
They're killing each other!

48:02.213 --> 48:03.441
Yaah!

48:04.115 --> 48:05.173
Captain!

48:09.120 --> 48:10.417
What are you two up to?

48:10.588 --> 48:11.919
Spark from the fire.

48:12.189 --> 48:16.057
He jumped back Knocked over
the chair Everything's fine.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.319
You cut yourself!

48:17.528 --> 48:18.528
No, I didn't.

48:18.596 --> 48:19.995
There's blood on your cheek.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.325
Must've nicked him with my nail
when I tried to grab him damn

48:23.534 --> 48:24.592
I'll see to it.

48:25.636 --> 48:28.969
Supper's chowder, cheese
Brussel sprouts and bread.

48:30.708 --> 48:32.005
Ghosts bleed?

48:32.209 --> 48:34.973
Appears so. That Viking saw you.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.441
Yeah! He was coming for me.

48:37.948 --> 48:39.016
Brown pants?

48:39.017 --> 48:40.108
Nearly.

48:41.318 --> 48:44.082
Not funny, Captain
He was aiming to kill me!

48:44.922 --> 48:46.287
What was the point of all that?

48:46.524 --> 48:49.152
They got slaves out of it
another boat.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.260
Destroyed the competition
Just business

48:52.496 --> 48:54.396
Roy Moehner with a spear.

48:54.598 --> 48:58.159
Surprizal! You're gonna need
it for Todd and Grendel

48:58.602 --> 49:01.332
and we're all going to need
it for Mr. Moehner.

49:03.007 --> 49:05.134
After tonight it'll be easy!

49:05.576 --> 49:09.103
It's never easy. Big lesson that, Jim.

49:09.547 --> 49:12.038
It's never, ever easy!

49:14.084 --> 49:15.949
There's a tin whistle up by my bed.

49:16.187 --> 49:18.087
Will you get it for this old man?

49:18.088 --> 49:22.889
Old, yes. But you look good
all things considered.

49:41.712 --> 49:43.111
They're doing good business, dad.

49:43.347 --> 49:44.405
Good?

49:44.648 --> 49:49.347
Yes but sadly all good things
must come to an end, my son.

49:49.587 --> 49:51.077
Where is Klaus?

49:51.889 --> 49:54.756
I want you boys to do a little
work for me tonight!

50:03.968 --> 50:05.902
That's Black Donald's March.

50:06.303 --> 50:08.066
That's not how it goes.

50:08.372 --> 50:10.636
So, how does it go then?

50:11.041 --> 50:12.041
Like this.

50:19.783 --> 50:20.875
Like this?

50:30.794 --> 50:32.091
Ah... better.

50:32.196 --> 50:34.096
You have a lovely voice.

50:34.331 --> 50:35.958
Yes, I do.

50:39.136 --> 50:42.628
Mind your manners, boys
this here's a house of

50:42.806 --> 50:45.639
go go go guhd repu u ute!

50:47.211 --> 50:49.076
Can we not serve them?

50:49.079 --> 50:52.105
Have to, I think. I'll call Robin.

50:52.850 --> 50:54.875
Three beers, Mad Meg.

50:55.119 --> 50:57.019
Two beers. A ginger ale for you.

50:57.154 --> 50:58.212
But.

51:00.791 --> 51:02.156
They come here often?

51:02.359 --> 51:05.089
Never. Mr. Moehner
must've seen the cars

51:05.296 --> 51:07.560
and told them to come
and make it hard for us

51:09.066 --> 51:13.935
I propose a drink to this
to this old, really old place

51:14.104 --> 51:18.131
and to you really
really old people in here tonight.

51:18.375 --> 51:20.104
A drink to the future!

51:24.148 --> 51:25.672
Oh, I beg your pardon, Madame.

51:26.150 --> 51:27.811
We'll just drink these beers

51:28.085 --> 51:30.144
and enjoy the antiques sitting around.

51:34.024 --> 51:35.491
Wait a minute, where're you going?

51:35.726 --> 51:37.489
To check the lines on the boat.

51:37.828 --> 51:41.355
We checked them! You can't
leave my mom alone here with them.

51:44.335 --> 51:47.361
What a good idea
to wear tartan trousers.

51:47.571 --> 51:49.766
That the family tartan is it
Mr. McLae?

51:50.007 --> 51:52.874
Don't you think the trousers
make you look a little fruity?

51:54.044 --> 51:57.707
Robin says normally
it's the barman who deals with this.

51:58.015 --> 51:59.107
Three of them against me?

51:59.283 --> 52:02.309
Why doesn't he just come over
and stand there. That'd do it.

52:02.553 --> 52:04.748
He knows all we've
we got here's a boy

52:04.955 --> 52:08.049
and useless old fart of a man who's
run off at the first sign of trouble.

52:09.994 --> 52:13.225
My boat's busted her lines
Who's a boat handler?

52:13.397 --> 52:14.728
Are you chaps fisherman?

52:15.032 --> 52:17.091
C'mon then, we'll get her back.

52:30.914 --> 52:33.712
Watch your feet
Slippery as all get out.

52:35.386 --> 52:38.355
Help me bring her in enough
so we can get a bow line on her.

52:39.089 --> 52:42.650
Can you find a coil of line to throw
to that fellow there What's your name

52:42.651 --> 52:43.493
Klaus.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.291
To Klaus when he gets aboard.

52:54.304 --> 52:55.828
Going on board.

52:58.842 --> 52:59.900
Watch it!

53:02.846 --> 53:04.814
What the damn hell happened?
Jesus Murphy!

53:05.149 --> 53:06.309
Hold onto the damn line.

53:06.517 --> 53:08.051
Sorry. Slipped.

53:08.052 --> 53:11.112
We'll be done in a minute
Anybody found a line?

53:11.355 --> 53:12.355
I got one here.

53:12.489 --> 53:14.320
Give it to me quick. I'm freezing.

53:18.629 --> 53:19.823
Secure the line.

53:20.030 --> 53:23.397
Shut your trap or you'll be
in the drink 'n you can't swim Carl

53:23.634 --> 53:25.431
Klaus, throw it to Jim.

53:38.015 --> 53:39.107
Oh!

53:40.284 --> 53:42.081
Get up off the deck, lad.

53:42.686 --> 53:46.679
She's fast. Let's get ourselves
up to the inn 'fore we freeze

53:46.890 --> 53:48.482
I owe you all a beer for this.

53:48.625 --> 53:50.855
She'd a been on the
rocks without you

53:51.095 --> 53:53.495
Jim, run see if your mum's got towels.

53:56.834 --> 53:58.301
Everybody listen!

53:59.069 --> 54:02.334
Give these boys a hand
of applause They're heroes.

54:08.212 --> 54:11.204
So let me take you down to
The Sou'wester and buy you the drink.

54:11.415 --> 54:15.283
You! Klaus, you better get yourself
into some warm clothes first.

54:15.519 --> 54:16.952
Pneumonia's not what you want.

54:17.154 --> 54:18.678
Captain?
You can't go!

54:18.889 --> 54:21.483
Oh, damn, Jim! You're right, I can't.

54:21.725 --> 54:23.590
Not 'til immigration clears me.

54:23.794 --> 54:26.160
A rain check, then, fellows?
Alright?

54:26.630 --> 54:28.120
A drink when I'm landed?

54:29.333 --> 54:30.333
Get him home.

54:30.334 --> 54:31.234
Will do.

54:31.235 --> 54:32.429
And the young one

54:35.639 --> 54:38.233
I saw some pie on the tables there.

54:38.475 --> 54:40.443
Apple. Would you like a slice?

54:40.644 --> 54:43.169
With a piece of cheddar, yes please?

54:44.047 --> 54:45.047
And a rum?

54:45.482 --> 54:48.713
That'd warm me up a wee bit
ma'am, thank you.

54:48.952 --> 54:50.351
Sit by the fire and I'll bring it.

54:56.627 --> 54:59.494
You didn't forget you couldn't
go downtown, did you?

54:59.730 --> 55:02.130
Better coming from you than me
though don't you think?

55:02.766 --> 55:06.099
I did think that
It was a great pleasure saying it.

55:06.270 --> 55:08.761
You knew Todd was aiming
to have me off the end of the dock.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.871
Hard for him to do it sitting down.

55:11.441 --> 55:12.441
Very.

55:12.442 --> 55:15.002
Lucky for the dog
Todd didn't bring him.

55:16.013 --> 55:17.913
Dogs like that can't swim.

55:18.081 --> 55:19.081
They can't?

55:19.082 --> 55:21.277
Nope. Mass's too heavy.

55:21.485 --> 55:24.113
They drown if they
get pushed in the water.

55:24.521 --> 55:27.046
An enemy's an enemy, Jim.

55:27.191 --> 55:28.988
What is, is

55:29.193 --> 55:31.027
and you have to be ever ready

55:31.028 --> 55:36.398
I am, sir. Did you set the safety line
or you always keep it there?

55:37.868 --> 55:39.130
I set it.

55:39.369 --> 55:40.996
Pity my mother'll never know.

55:41.305 --> 55:42.533
Just you and me.

55:42.806 --> 55:45.240
Surprizal only works
when you're a step ahead.

55:45.475 --> 55:47.067
Really something. I loved it.

55:47.068 --> 55:48.044
Loved what?

55:48.612 --> 55:50.978
The thought of eating your pie.

55:51.648 --> 55:54.310
Humph. Your boat safe?

55:54.551 --> 55:56.041
At least for tonight.

55:56.153 --> 55:58.280
The Hirtles might set it on fire Monday

56:05.229 --> 56:07.493
Meg sings in the church choir?

56:07.764 --> 56:08.924
Yes, sir

56:09.166 --> 56:10.929
Roy Moehner goes to Church?

56:11.068 --> 56:12.296
Front pew

56:12.469 --> 56:14.937
I think I'll go to church tomorrow.

56:15.172 --> 56:17.538
Get me another look at
Mr. Moehner.

56:17.808 --> 56:20.436
Get me a good deep
look into his eyes.

56:35.092 --> 56:37.185
Keepin' a weather eye
out for that dog?

56:37.494 --> 56:39.462
She'd never mount an attack here.

56:40.030 --> 56:42.157
She'll wait for a chance to ambush.

56:42.532 --> 56:46.161
Evasion's your only tactic until
you've made a plan of Surprizal.

56:46.336 --> 56:48.964
What do you think
I showed you that Viking attack for?

56:49.172 --> 56:50.639
To teach me the Surprizal tactic.

56:50.841 --> 56:51.841
Why?

56:51.842 --> 56:53.571
To win the fight with the dog!

56:53.810 --> 56:54.868
So?

56:55.112 --> 56:57.273
So, It was all about killing

56:57.514 --> 56:58.674
I don't want to kill him!

56:58.675 --> 56:59.649
You don't?

56:59.650 --> 57:01.447
Gosh, no!
He's a dog!

57:01.652 --> 57:03.244
He's your mortal enemy.

57:03.487 --> 57:05.955
Right. He is But he's still a dog!

57:07.391 --> 57:09.484
Lucky he's not a cow or a chicken!

57:09.693 --> 57:12.059
Then we'd kill him and eat him
wouldn't we.

57:19.169 --> 57:21.069
Your enemy's your enemy

57:21.238 --> 57:24.036
and you're gonna have to fight him
but you need battle plans.

57:24.174 --> 57:26.768
One for the dog. One for Todd.

57:27.010 --> 57:29.604
Two fronts. You have to be ready.

57:30.347 --> 57:33.016
You don't have to kill 'em
you just have to win

57:33.017 --> 57:34.950
I know. I'm figuring it out.

57:35.319 --> 57:36.946
Surprizal's going to show me a way.

57:38.121 --> 57:39.952
Okay. Coast's clear.

57:41.725 --> 57:43.124
Here come the Moehners.

57:48.231 --> 57:49.231
Thank you.

57:49.399 --> 57:50.923
Your boy Klaus alright?

57:51.134 --> 57:53.625
Just barely. Freezing cold he was.

57:54.371 --> 57:58.364
Because he went into the bay
to save my boat I'm very grateful.

57:58.575 --> 58:00.076
That was what it was?

58:00.077 --> 58:03.376
He's alive not here at church
but he's alive.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.645
Your boat set to sail off, is she?

58:05.849 --> 58:09.717
I figure I'll stay a while
The inn's a lovely old place.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.481
A complete wreck
but lovely. I'll renovate it.

58:13.623 --> 58:16.387
Waiting for his mother to come
to terms with what's best for her

58:16.593 --> 58:18.060
and this grand lad of hers.

58:18.128 --> 58:19.959
We'll have enough money
to pay you off just as soon as

58:20.197 --> 58:22.188
the Captain's
immigration papers clear!

58:23.000 --> 58:24.126
Is that so?

58:24.868 --> 58:26.768
Need to pay my bill, that's all.

58:26.903 --> 58:29.030
Amen to paying bills.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.642
You and your big mouth.

58:33.944 --> 58:36.378
Moehner'll be on the phone
with Immigration in the morning

58:36.546 --> 58:39.071
and they'll go over my Merry
with a fine tooth comb.

58:39.082 --> 58:43.075
- Sorry. The look on his face just.
- Natural reaction

58:43.086 --> 58:46.351
but natural reactions
can get you killed sometimes.

58:46.690 --> 58:51.559
Remember you always have
to Listen think respond.

58:53.130 --> 58:54.495
This's quite a car

58:54.765 --> 58:57.165
1950 Olsmobile 98.

58:57.401 --> 58:59.631
They say it's the only one
like it in Canada.

58:59.870 --> 59:02.168
Must feel lonely all by itself up here.

59:03.573 --> 59:04.972
That'll be Meg...

59:07.277 --> 59:08.972
An angel.

59:09.646 --> 59:12.444
Go into church
I've seen his eyes

59:12.716 --> 59:14.274
I'll be at the boat after.

59:29.166 --> 59:31.293
How's she look?
Bristol?

59:31.468 --> 59:33.800
Bristol?
She looks alright to me.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.937
Good. Let's put her to bed

59:48.585 --> 59:51.076
I wanna see where that goes.

59:51.688 --> 59:53.019
We can't let Mother know.

59:54.157 --> 59:55.988
That where Roy Moehner lives?

59:56.193 --> 59:57.193
That's right.

59:57.194 --> 59:59.924
He's watching us Right now.

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.187
You can see him?

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:03.889
Sun's glinting off his binoculars.

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.030
What's that building over there?

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:08.800
That's Mr. Moehner's warehouse.

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:10.632
And the boats at the dock there?

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:12.968
Klaus's. Mr. Moehner's
Why?

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.975
Them's what I heard the first night.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.672
Their voices. Their talk.

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:19.939
It came across water like they
were whispering in my ear

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:23.109
I'll bet they're trafficking contraband.

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.448
You think they are?

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:28.122
I figure maybe
Roy's the French word for king.

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:29.525
Did'ja know that?

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.090
Do you know
what happened to French king?

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:35.323
People got fed up
and cut the Roi's head off.

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:38.966
We're fed up!
So it'll be off with Roy's head.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:45.933
You ready?

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:48.843
We'll go to 1719.

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.809
It's the golden age of piracy.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.207
You ready to go there?

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:54.583
Now?

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:57.514
If we're going to cut
off the King's head

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.516
we better get prepared

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:00.823
I'm ready.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.655
Scared, but ready.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.457
It's good to be a little scared

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:06.960
but if we're to save this inn
we're going to have a real fight

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.225
so we should see
how the pirates fight.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.963
Ready when you are, Captain.

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:14.466
Good. Into those flames we go

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.271
a sail! A sail!

01:01:20.477 --> 01:01:22.172
Fair by us. Eastward

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.438
two points upon her weather bow.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:26.806
Set the compass.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.822
Who's that?

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:44.828
Calico Jack and his wife
the pirate, Anne Bonney.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:47.803
Gosh. She's beautiful

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:51.439
she's changing course
heading south east

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.270
chase!

01:01:57.347 --> 01:01:58.347
What's happening?

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:02.075
Lookout's seen a sail
Heading towards the Spanish Main.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.280
Mon Capitaine!
C'est vraiment vous?

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:05.647
Vous etes avec nous?

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.083
Sure am, Pierre.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:08.957
They speak French?

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.955
Some of 'em. Sure they do

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.040
capitaine johnson est avec nous!

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.774
This is my friend, Jim Hawkins.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.878
Never been in a chase before.

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:33.714
You're good luck, Jim.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:36.214
It's a great day
when the Captain's with us.

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:38.443
You long out of port, Jack?

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.122
Sixteen days
We need to bring something back.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.721
Will we board and fight, sir?

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.757
I hope not. Come quiet
Show the black flag

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:49.125
not the red nose into their quarter
and hope they'll give up.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:52.295
Don't want their ship. Just the cargo.

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.196
People like living

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:59.405
bring up the small arms!

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.774
Glad to have you with the Captain
young master Hawkins.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:05.174
Sling the yards in chain?

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.248
Fore and main and the crossjack.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.136
Can I do anything?

01:03:11.137 --> 01:03:12.487
Watch and learn.

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:15.086
A lot of preparation for battle.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:18.350
See if any of it applies
to our Mr. Moehner.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:32.633
To a short fight, men.

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.011
To great profit and a safe trip home

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:39.641
God save us all!
Hurrah!

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:43.945
Augh!
You said rum was good. Yuck!

01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:52.386
Raise our colours!

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:54.787
Fly the black flag!

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:59.697
Calico Jack designed this flag.

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.994
The skull and crossed swords.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.867
Everyone uses it now.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.368
It was his.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.112
Look!

01:04:10.113 --> 01:04:11.113
Be ready, Jim

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.474
I'm ready, Captain.

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:13.649
AH!

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:16.009
I'm alright!

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:19.248
You fools!
Find cover!

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.523
Musketman!

01:04:22.026 --> 01:04:23.025
Ready.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.026
Aim

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.527
fire!

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.530
Musketmen!

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:32.801
Ready.

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.069
Aim

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:35.070
we surrender!

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.071
We surrender!

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:39.873
Drop all your arms on deck
and prepare for boarding.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.509
Grappling arms!

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:46.378
Call your men from above
One shot and we destroy you all

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:47.843
Jim...

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:51.153
Jim.

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:53.046
The two of you!
My goodness

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.350
I leave you alone for two seconds
and into dream land you go.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.591
Bring those dishes over here, Jimmy

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:01.730
and then get up to bed
Your work all down?

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:05.600
She's ruined everything.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.593
We'll go back tomorrow.

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:09.795
Too late. The chase'll be done!

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.064
It's a shooting star, lad

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.036
and they're never done, are they?

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.379
She'll be there for us tomorrow.

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.237
Right where we left off.

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:20.506
What is, is.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.612
It's that simple. Concentrate.

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:26.219
Remember exactly what you saw.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.784
Would you like a rum, Captain?

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.787
A tea, please?
And some toast?

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.229
Prepare?
I know what I saw. Preparation.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:39.196
Thorough, detailed preparation.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:43.566
And preparation's what we'll
need to take down Roy Moehner.

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:45.069
And Grendel.

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.115
Are you going to die?

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:56.913
I don't think so.

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.053
Good.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.280
Go help your mum.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.028
It's all going to be fine.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:10.223
Trust me. He's a great lad, your boy.

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:13.158
We'll have a fight with
Mr. Moehner and his dog

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.834
but this is a fight I know how to win

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:18.233
and your son is learning very fast.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:22.011
It'll be a battle royale!
Lots'a fireworks!

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:40.788
It's Monday and these officers
are here to clear you into Canada.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.830
Oh, good. Good
How do you do?

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:47.398
Fine, thank you, sir Have you
carried anything at all ashore?

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:50.034
Uh, s s sorry?

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:53.008
Have you brought anything ashore?

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.562
Toothbrush. Clothes to dry out
That sort of thing.

01:06:56.563 --> 01:07:00.116
If you want to look
come, the room's upstairs.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:02.243
Captain Johnson?
Stay here, please.

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:04.077
They don't want to see my room?

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:05.087
Just your papers.

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:08.486
My papers?
They're on the bar there.

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:15.120
Oh damn. In my pocket.

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.431
Silly.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:18.124
Bad night.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.496
Get 'em now and then.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.262
How long do you plan to stay?

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:24.963
The old girl's gotta come
out of the water.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.837
Planks need to be looked
at 'fore she's safe to put out to sea

01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:30.502
and the engine's down.

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:31.871
When do you plan to leave?

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:33.809
Uhm, spring?

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:36.213
You can support yourself?

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:39.348
Going to go to the bank as soon
as you give me permission.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.959
Welcome to Canada.

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.968
Close to a hundred a month
once you count his rum.

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:56.365
And he's given a month's
security. Unheard of.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.131
We got enough?

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.875
With some to spare.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:02.905
You want me to come with you?

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.076
I'll be fine.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:07.516
Just fine.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:20.819
Count it!

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.933
Give me my receipt.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:47.011
He's the slimiest man in the world
He smiles I want to throw up.

01:08:47.156 --> 01:08:50.353
Roy's not going to go away easily.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.024
Someone's called Immigration
complaining they were too easy

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:57.029
on the Captain They're coming back!

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.033
Roy Moehner!

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.202
If Immigration takes his permit

01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:02.633
Roy figures you'll take
back your money and leave.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:05.774
Hah! He's aiming to dismast us.

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:07.009
What are we going to do?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.443
What can we do?

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:09.678
Prepare.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:13.011
Prepare Prepare how?
For what?

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:16.076
Prepare for battle. Plan an attack.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:19.014
We surprise our Mr. Roy Moehner.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:22.484
It's a Pirate trick, mum
They call it Surprizal!

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:24.993
He won't expect us to attack
so we will!

01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:26.962
We're going to attack Roy Moehner?

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:28.892
We shall, Mrs. Hawkins.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:32.124
Roy's run of luck
may come to its end today.

01:09:32.135 --> 01:09:34.466
All endeavors legal, of course.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.464
Where'd he get that car from?

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.197
I don't know. Why?

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:41.044
It's not one that's sold in Canada.

01:09:41.045 --> 01:09:42.671
Then how come he has it?

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:48.073
Have you ever seen inside
his warehouse Seen what's in it?

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.149
The one on the point no?
Why?

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.421
He's just curious, that's all.

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.590
Are you sure that car's
not sold in Canada?

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:58.160
Dead sure. Only in America.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:00.095
Must've been brought in somehow.

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:01.888
Really.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.794
You're smiling

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:07.559
I am, Kerstin. For sure, I am

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:16.368
Jim, you know what to do?

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:17.679
With the car?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:18.880
Yes.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.606
Don't get caught!

01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:25.080
Be nice to them when they come.

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.749
They'll be wrapped around it.

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:31.883
We're all set then?

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:34.186
Captain?

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.328
Good luck to all of us.

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.784
You forget something, gentlemen?

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:08.589
We have a few more questions we'd
like to ask Captain Johnson, Ma'am.

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.389
Please let him know we've arrived.

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.430
We'll wait for him by his boat.

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:25.974
When the winds calm down, Shirley

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.339
Robert

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.785
I was sailing from England.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:39.995
Oh! England's so
beautiful this time of year.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.323
The air has a crisp.

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.499
Captain, you're getting
sidetracked again.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:46.126
Some days are better
than others, I'm afraid

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:49.799
I was on a port tack
when I was caught in the storm.

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:51.663
Extraordinary storm.

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:54.104
Quite a challenge for a single hander.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:56.874
- The tiller was nearly pulled.
- Captain Johnson

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.079
please focus.

01:11:58.281 --> 01:11:59.441
Where was your

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:05.520
I thought you gentleman might be
in need of something wet and warm.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:14.130
Captain, are these two
ruffians treating you unkindly?

01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:17.293
If they are, tell me
and I'll get involved.

01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:00.601
Sorry for bothering you again
about Captain Johnson.

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:04.176
And thanks for warming us up
Miss o'leary. Quite wonderful.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:10.450
Why don't you two come in for
a bite to eat with Kerstin and me.

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:11.786
Now?

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.052
We'd love to, ma'am!
Thank you.

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:16.458
Truth be told, we're starving

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.371
Shirley still inside?

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:35.806
Yup, and Roy Moehner's up there too.

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.011
Tire's flat. Good.

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:15.416
May we have the key, please
Shirley?

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.648
Oh...

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:24.951
Ma'am, what is, is...

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:35.968
Oh my

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:39.238
I'll hold the key, Robin

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:42.035
Jim and I'll stand guard
until you come back.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:44.212
Shirley'll stay here with us.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.118
Hello, Robin.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:34.961
- I have a flat tire. I wonder if you.
- Mister Roy Moehner?

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.197
Yes?

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:40.429
How did you get that car
that Oldsmobile 98 into the country?

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:41.795
Newfoundland.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.666
A boat of mine brought it here
when they joined Confederation.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:46.870
Did you think that was legal?

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.373
My lawyer assured me it was.

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:52.513
Lawyers advise, the choice is yours.

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:55.113
What's in that
warehouse on the point?

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:56.883
Commercial goods.

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:58.347
Let's go have a look then

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.351
I I I don't have a key.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.990
We do.

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:49.630
You thought you could dismast us
didn't you, Mister Gentleman?

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.035
I have no idea what you're talking
about Now just get out of my way.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.606
You going swimming?

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:55.810
What the hell!

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:58.880
We just blew your ship
out of the water, mister

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.845
and you don't even
know it sank, do you.

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:03.712
Well, you're about to find out!

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.318
Surprizal!

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.122
Mr. Moehner

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:09.581
please be advised that
we are arresting you on charges

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:12.027
of the illegal importation
of contraband goods

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:13.722
with further charges pending

01:17:13.896 --> 01:17:16.194
surprizal! Mr. Roy Moehner.

01:17:19.602 --> 01:17:20.762
What are you doing?

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:23.037
They're taking you to Halifax

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:26.538
I need to speak to my wife.

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.567
Kerstin will call her.

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:39.477
He'd been smuggling everything
fancy in for his resort. The inn.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:40.915
Which means what?

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:45.161
Jail. He's got enough illegal booze
to keep an army drunk for years.

01:17:45.162 --> 01:17:46.651
And our mortgage?

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:49.444
This seems proof of extortion.

01:17:49.445 --> 01:17:51.726
He was a conniving cheat, a rat.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:57.135
Well, now that that's done
all the inn needs is money!

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.113
We'll get it.

01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:23.422
Don't be a shilly shally.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:30.330
What a day.

01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:32.131
There's still Grendel and Todd

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.870
I'm working on a plan
But for tomorrow.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.274
Will we go back to Calico Jack?

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:42.240
We will, but tonight you need
to write your paper

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.076
and I need more rum.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.147
Upstairs, now.

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.560
You don't burn yourself, either?

01:19:03.706 --> 01:19:04.706
No.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.837
But you can't fly, can you?

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:08.076
No.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.374
No, I can't fly.

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.075
But I'll tell you what I can do

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:15.244
I can get damn cold.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:40.441
Stop doing that, Todd.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.035
You got my dad arrested

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.106
I'm warning you, Todd.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:48.749
Nyaaa! You gonna cry on me?

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:50.919
No, I'm not going to cry on you

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.484
I'm gonna kill your dog.

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:56.350
You'd really kill Grendel?

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.116
If it turned into a fight
to the death, sure

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:01.562
but that's not how it's
going to happen with a dog.

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:06.133
Hurry up, Jenny. We'll be late.

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:15.171
How many pages is this?

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:16.501
Eleven

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.512
I asked for five.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:20.212
It's a big subject.

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:23.616
Did you do this?

01:20:24.053 --> 01:20:25.077
Yessir.

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:29.088
Last time I asked you, you said
you didn't even have a paint set

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:32.155
I bought one
I've a part time job

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:31.109
brand hurry it up. We'll all drown
if you're not quick about it.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.994
Porky!

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.129
I can't hold on for long.

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.337
Struck the water building
the foundation of it.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:56.669
That's how I know about it
It opens up just twice a year.

01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:58.403
Then the surge won't let you in.

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:02.414
Saw a formation like
that south of Krakatoa once.

01:22:02.785 --> 01:22:04.946
Magical. Perfect

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.191
captain!

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:13.127
Jim?

01:22:13.796 --> 01:22:15.024
I got an A+.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:18.358
An A+ and that was
just on the first part.

01:22:18.567 --> 01:22:21.035
Mr. Herkes let me have
till after Christmas to finish it

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:25.037
but he's given me an A+
on what I've done so far. Here.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.537
Where's the Captain?

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:30.839
Down in the basement. Jim
this is wonderful.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.073
In the basement?
Why?

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:35.349
He's going to write up
a history of the place

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.712
for the travel brochure
that he's going to get printed.

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:39.543
He said you start from
the bottom up

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:41.780
so that's where he is. Down there

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:43.685
I'm going to tell him my mark

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:49.990
captain johnson!

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.534
Captain Johnson?

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:01.070
Coming, Jim.

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.575
Hold on. I'm coming

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.355
captain!

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.590
Gimme a hand here, son

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.568
I loved that hat.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.574
We better get out of here.

01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:38.239
Right. We better had.

01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:41.273
What's that?

01:23:43.919 --> 01:23:46.752
This, lad, is a piece of eight.

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.855
This is what you came back
to Grey rocks for?

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.958
Maybe. Maybe not, though.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.352
Maybe I came back for you
What d'ya think?

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:58.160
I think What is, is Captain.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.965
What is, is.

01:24:05.073 --> 01:24:06.073
Quick, boy.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.052
We'll show it to mum!

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.412
Oh, to hell with it

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:22.455
I'm not losing that hat
after all these years

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.057
I'm going back after it

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.921
I'll put a safety line on you.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.065
Mother. Meg. We need help!

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:44.771
JIM!

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.772
In here, Mom!

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:58.719
Are you hurt?

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.188
You scared the wits out of us, boy.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.154
Captain, you're soaking wet!

01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:05.033
I had to get wet.

01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:06.033
Why?

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:07.601
To get you this.

01:25:12.975 --> 01:25:14.272
It's beautiful.

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.405
And this.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.847
Holy Mary.

01:25:40.035 --> 01:25:42.629
Is this you done
with Grey Rocks then?

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:47.038
By Jove, no lad.

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:50.077
What with what we have
to do with the inn

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:53.044
with my boat, with the Moehners.

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:55.074
More work on your essay

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:58.512
I expect I'll be here for... for ages.

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:04.050
Do you think there's anymore
treasure down there?

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.984
I expect we'll have to
find out, won't we

01:26:07.305 --> 01:26:13.234
