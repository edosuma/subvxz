tension in my neck.

1:12:24.995 --> 1:12:25.996
- It's done.

1:12:26.859 --> 1:12:28.205
It's done, okay?

1:12:29.586 --> 1:12:30.415
Let's go.

1:12:31.485 --> 1:12:32.658
I can get you a car back.

1:12:32.693 --> 1:12:35.316
I don't give a shit.
[Jen laughing]

1:12:35.351 --> 1:12:36.835
- You know what?

1:12:36.869 --> 1:12:38.388
- We don't have to do this.

1:12:38.423 --> 1:12:40.977
- Fuck you, seriously fuck you.

1:12:41.011 --> 1:12:42.219
You're a bitch.

1:12:42.254 --> 1:12:43.704
You are a conniving bitch.

1:12:43.738 --> 1:12:46.362
I've known it since the day
I met you, but you're hot.

1:12:46.396 --> 1:12:47.673
So that's why I stayed with you.

1:12:47.708 --> 1:12:49.468
Fuck you, I hate you.

1:12:51.056 --> 1:12:51.884
- Bye!

1:12:53.645 --> 1:12:55.647
Good luck with Shmooly!

1:12:58.374 --> 1:13:01.031
[horns blaring]

1:13:03.551 --> 1:13:05.415
And we're back.

1:13:05.450 --> 1:13:08.245
I'm here at the Historic
Downtown Farmers Market.

1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:09.074
I'm with Peter.

1:13:09.108 --> 1:13:09.902
Peter, say hi.

1:13:09.937 --> 1:13:11.387
- [Peter] What it do!

1:13:11.421 --> 1:13:14.182
- The footage that we shot
in Vegas actually turned out
to be really good.

1:13:14.217 --> 1:13:16.081
Like we have a legit movie.

1:13:16.115 --> 1:13:17.393
It's crazy.

1:13:17.427 --> 1:13:19.049
- I can't get Abe
to sign a release.

1:13:19.084 --> 1:13:20.430
I've been calling him,
I've been texting him,

1:13:20.465 --> 1:13:23.053
I've sent him DMs, nothing.

1:13:23.088 --> 1:13:25.642
And he just posted to
his Shmooly Instagram

1:13:25.677 --> 1:13:28.369
that he's here,
downtown at this market,

1:13:28.404 --> 1:13:30.406
looking for peppers
for his hot sauce.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.616
So we're gonna track his ass
down and get him to sign this.

1:13:34.651 --> 1:13:35.480
Let's see.

1:13:38.724 --> 1:13:42.245
There he is, in the
yellow Shmooly shirt.

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:44.212
We got him.

1:13:44.247 --> 1:13:45.731
Come on, let's go.

1:13:47.388 --> 1:13:48.562
- How much are the pears?
- Abe!

1:13:48.596 --> 1:13:50.011
- [Vendor] $3 a pound.

1:13:50.046 --> 1:13:50.840
- $3?

1:13:50.874 --> 1:13:52.358
- Abe!

1:13:52.393 --> 1:13:53.463
- What are you doing here?

1:13:53.498 --> 1:13:54.326
- Hey.

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:55.534
- Hey.

1:13:55.569 --> 1:13:56.915
- I've been trying to
call you, and text you,

1:13:56.949 --> 1:13:59.469
and you haven't been
getting back to me.

1:13:59.504 --> 1:14:01.471
- That's true, yeah.

1:14:01.506 --> 1:14:03.473
You got Peter here,
just bum rushing me?

1:14:03.508 --> 1:14:04.474
- [Peter] What's up bro!
- Yeah.

1:14:04.509 --> 1:14:05.958
We had to come find you.

1:14:05.993 --> 1:14:08.271
- You like stalking my
Instagram or something?

1:14:08.305 --> 1:14:09.962
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

1:14:10.894 --> 1:14:11.930
I need you to sign this.

1:14:11.964 --> 1:14:13.379
- What is that?

1:14:13.414 --> 1:14:15.312
- It's a release, for our movie.

1:14:15.347 --> 1:14:17.487
- Can we not get
into this here, now?

1:14:17.522 --> 1:14:19.040
- We just need to go talk.

1:14:19.075 --> 1:14:19.869
Can we go talk?

1:14:19.903 --> 1:14:20.939
Please?

1:14:20.973 --> 1:14:23.528
[Abe sighs]

1:14:23.562 --> 1:14:25.081
Let's go sit down.

1:14:25.944 --> 1:14:26.876
- Okay fine.

1:14:26.910 --> 1:14:27.704
I'll sit down, okay.

1:14:27.739 --> 1:14:28.567
- Come on, come on.

1:14:28.602 --> 1:14:29.465
It's okay.

1:14:32.433 --> 1:14:33.503
How do we look?

1:14:33.538 --> 1:14:34.573
Light good?

1:14:34.608 --> 1:14:36.644
- [Peter] Looks perfect.

1:14:36.679 --> 1:14:38.404
- It's good to see you.

1:14:38.439 --> 1:14:40.096
- It is good to see you.

1:14:40.130 --> 1:14:41.028
- You look great!

1:14:41.062 --> 1:14:42.098
- You look really good.

1:14:42.132 --> 1:14:43.513
- Thanks.

1:14:43.548 --> 1:14:45.791
- You look beautiful as
always, to be totally honest.

1:14:45.826 --> 1:14:46.827
- Thank you.

1:14:48.207 --> 1:14:50.002
I have to ask.

1:14:50.037 --> 1:14:52.384
Why have you been ignoring me?

1:14:52.418 --> 1:14:54.006
Like what the hell?

1:14:55.421 --> 1:14:57.838
- Honestly, I'm really regretful

1:14:57.872 --> 1:15:00.530
about the way
everything played out

1:15:00.565 --> 1:15:04.016
and I said some
really shitty things.

1:15:04.051 --> 1:15:07.503
And that the fact that
that's all, I don't know

1:15:07.537 --> 1:15:09.435
fuckin' recorded
somewhere is scary

1:15:09.470 --> 1:15:12.093
and I've been trying
not to think about it

1:15:12.128 --> 1:15:13.336
to be honest.

1:15:13.370 --> 1:15:14.717
Yeah, just been
trying to move on.

1:15:14.751 --> 1:15:15.787
- I get that.

1:15:18.341 --> 1:15:20.205
I was really shitty too.

1:15:20.239 --> 1:15:21.689
- Yeah we were pretty
shitty to each other.

1:15:21.724 --> 1:15:22.897
- I'm really sorry.

1:15:22.932 --> 1:15:24.140
- You're sorry?

1:15:24.174 --> 1:15:27.212
- Yeah, I'm sorry it
got as bad as it did.

1:15:27.246 --> 1:15:29.455
That's not what I wanted at all.

1:15:29.490 --> 1:15:32.286
- What exactly are
you sorry about?

1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:34.391
- Sorry for being mean to you.

1:15:34.426 --> 1:15:36.773
- I'm definitely sorry for
being that mean to you.

1:15:36.808 --> 1:15:38.085
I think it was
really unwarranted

1:15:38.119 --> 1:15:40.121
and maybe even having
the camera there,

1:15:40.156 --> 1:15:41.675
made us act a
little differently.

1:15:41.709 --> 1:15:42.607
- Sure.

1:15:42.641 --> 1:15:44.574
- It got pretty fucked up.

1:15:44.609 --> 1:15:46.576
- I do wanna say though,

1:15:47.750 --> 1:15:50.097
it made a really good movie.

1:15:52.099 --> 1:15:54.757
Yeah, like Peter
shot it so well.

1:15:56.172 --> 1:15:58.208
This could go to
like festivals, dude.

1:15:58.243 --> 1:15:59.589
You have to see it.

1:15:59.624 --> 1:16:01.418
- So us being
shitty to each other

1:16:01.453 --> 1:16:03.213
in Vegas could go to festivals?

1:16:03.248 --> 1:16:06.285
- I'm just saying, I don't
want Grandma getting sick

1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:10.289
and our relationship going
to shit to be for nothing.

1:16:10.324 --> 1:16:11.636
- Well, a big part
of me feels like

1:16:11.670 --> 1:16:13.948
we should take the
footage and set it on fire

1:16:13.983 --> 1:16:17.849
and show it to no one because
we are so shitty in it.

1:16:17.883 --> 1:16:19.126
- This could be
good for Shmooly,

1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:22.129
this would be good
for you, I promise.

1:16:22.163 --> 1:16:23.820
The content is dope.

1:16:25.270 --> 1:16:26.478
I just need you do sign this,

1:16:26.512 --> 1:16:27.859
and we can move forward with it.

1:16:27.893 --> 1:16:28.687
I think--

1:16:28.722 --> 1:16:31.172
[Abe laughing]

1:16:31.207 --> 1:16:32.864
It's just a release.

1:16:34.451 --> 1:16:35.625
- I'll take a look
at the footage

1:16:35.660 --> 1:16:39.249
and if it's not the
worst thing ever, maybe.

1:16:40.423 --> 1:16:42.218
- I'm happy to show
it to you, seriously.

1:16:42.252 --> 1:16:43.737
You're great in it.
[Abe laughs]

1:16:43.771 --> 1:16:47.948
Also, I would love it if you
edited, just to give some--

1:16:47.982 --> 1:16:49.639
- Now it all makes sense.

1:16:49.674 --> 1:16:51.330
Okay you want me to
edit the footage.

1:16:51.365 --> 1:16:54.264
- Well no, just to give some
of your perspective on it.

1:16:54.299 --> 1:16:56.266
So it's coming from both of us.
I wanna be partners on this.

1:16:56.301 --> 1:16:58.027
- Okay, I will take a
look at the footage,

1:16:58.061 --> 1:16:59.511
and we can go from there.

1:16:59.545 --> 1:17:01.478
I'm not gonna sign anything
but show me the footage.

1:17:01.513 --> 1:17:03.170
- You're gonna like it.

1:17:03.204 --> 1:17:07.450
- I'm sure I'm gonna have
some kind of response to it.

1:17:07.484 --> 1:17:10.936
- And honestly, I do
really care about you,

1:17:10.971 --> 1:17:12.904
and I am very sorry that
it turned out like this,

1:17:12.938 --> 1:17:15.216
and I do want us to be friends.

1:17:15.251 --> 1:17:16.804
Seriously.

1:17:16.839 --> 1:17:19.358
- I meant that,
when I said that.

1:17:19.393 --> 1:17:21.188
I think that would be cool.

1:17:21.222 --> 1:17:22.948
And I don't hate you.

1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:25.606
- I don't hate you either.

1:17:25.641 --> 1:17:27.677
- I mean in the
moment I felt that.

1:17:27.712 --> 1:17:29.541
I was like, fucking A

1:17:29.575 --> 1:17:30.991
I hate her in that moment.

1:17:31.025 --> 1:17:33.510
But I don't feel that.
- Just give me a hug.

1:17:33.545 --> 1:17:34.442
- Okay.

1:17:34.477 --> 1:17:36.686
- Just give me a hug please.

1:17:41.829 --> 1:17:44.660
- It's definitely
good to see you.
