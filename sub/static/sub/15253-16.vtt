01:48.507 --> 01:51.342
Good.

02:00.986 --> 02:03.621
Oh, yeah. Rose petals! Nice touch. Really?

02:03.689 --> 02:05.589
You don't think it's too much?
It's me and Alex's

02:05.657 --> 02:06.757
first Valentine's Day together,

02:06.825 --> 02:08.826
and I don't want to overdo it. Nah.

02:16.501 --> 02:18.169
Is that a bearskin rug?

02:18.236 --> 02:20.271
Yeah, yeah. I got it at Big Lots!

02:20.339 --> 02:21.572
Had to buy it in bulk though,

02:21.640 --> 02:22.873
so if you know anyone who
wants a bearskin rug,

02:22.941 --> 02:24.608
I got eight of them.

02:24.676 --> 02:26.010
Oh, that's good.

02:26.078 --> 02:27.178
Okay, here we go.

02:27.245 --> 02:29.280
8:00 sharp. So, game plan review.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.348
For the next 90 minutes,

02:30.415 --> 02:31.549
you and Alex take the living room

02:31.616 --> 02:32.817
while Sarah and I are in our bedroom.

02:32.884 --> 02:35.353
Then at precisely... 9:30, Alex and I will

02:35.420 --> 02:37.388
saunter off to our room

02:37.456 --> 02:39.357
leaving you and Sarah ample time to watch

02:39.424 --> 02:40.624
<i>Love Actually.</i>

02:40.692 --> 02:43.294
Ah, yes! A hit with ladies around the world.

02:43.362 --> 02:45.896
And men.

02:45.964 --> 02:47.431
And don't worry about your
soufflés, 'cause I will

02:47.499 --> 02:49.633
keep an eye on them, and make
sure they rise to perfection.

02:49.701 --> 02:52.002
Alex. Okay.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.105
Good luck. You, too. Okay.

02:54.172 --> 02:55.139
Oh, wait! Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

02:55.207 --> 02:56.674
Just one more thing.

02:56.742 --> 02:58.743
It's Valentine's Day...

02:58.810 --> 03:00.010
we both have girlfriends.

03:00.078 --> 03:00.878
I know!

03:03.048 --> 03:04.148
Okay. Go.

03:04.216 --> 03:06.150
We did it.

03:06.218 --> 03:07.818
Thank God.

03:07.886 --> 03:09.754
I haven't slept in three days.

03:09.821 --> 03:11.922
You know what else we haven't
done in three days...

03:11.990 --> 03:14.158
or three months?

03:14.226 --> 03:15.960
Are you saying it's time

03:16.027 --> 03:18.596
for Mommy and Daddy to
celebrate Valentine's?

03:18.663 --> 03:20.431
Can we not call ourselves Mommy and Daddy...

03:20.499 --> 03:21.432
in the bedroom?

03:21.500 --> 03:24.001
How 'bout... "Who's your Daddy?"

03:24.069 --> 03:25.669
Still no.

03:30.942 --> 03:33.577
Let Clara cry it out.

03:33.645 --> 03:35.246
It'll prepare her for the real world.

03:35.313 --> 03:37.047
Or at least, the nursery.

03:37.115 --> 03:38.616
You're such a good dad.

03:38.683 --> 03:41.552
And you're a good mom.

03:44.122 --> 03:45.189
Mm!

03:50.195 --> 03:51.962
I can't do it! I can't do it either.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.531
What do you need, little baby?

03:53.598 --> 03:55.099
Come on.

04:04.376 --> 04:05.709
I'm gonna treat you so good,

04:05.777 --> 04:07.311
you're never gonna let me go.

04:07.379 --> 04:08.579
<i>Pretty Woman reference.</i>

04:08.647 --> 04:10.147
Isn't that movie about a prostitute?

04:10.215 --> 04:13.250
Yeah, but Julia Roberts is
so delightful, isn't she?

04:13.318 --> 04:14.919
Mm-hmm. Wait for it.

04:14.986 --> 04:16.286
Boom!

04:16.353 --> 04:18.422
Homemade, baby. Well,

04:18.490 --> 04:19.957
I have a surprise for you

04:20.024 --> 04:22.893
underneath this, you know.
Oh, do you really?

04:22.961 --> 04:25.162
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Well...

04:25.230 --> 04:26.664
But first, I made you a little something.

04:26.731 --> 04:28.399
Chocolate strawberries.

04:28.467 --> 04:29.767
They're in the fridge.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.903
Morgan and Alex have the living room.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.305
What do you mean "have"?

04:34.372 --> 04:36.507
You know, like, in college,

04:36.575 --> 04:37.942
when you got to hang a sock on the door...?

04:38.009 --> 04:39.610
A sock? Why would you do that?

04:39.678 --> 04:41.545
You know what? Doesn't matter.
I'm just going to go out there.

04:41.613 --> 04:42.813
It's only been-- what?-- like five minutes.

04:42.881 --> 04:44.815
Not a lot could have happened by now.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.715
Did you hear that?

05:17.782 --> 05:19.617
I did!

05:19.684 --> 05:21.185
It was like our souls are so close

05:21.253 --> 05:22.386
they're vibrating.

05:22.454 --> 05:24.054
That's what it is.

05:24.122 --> 05:25.656
Yeah. That's exactly what it is.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.867
Okay, okay. You know what?

05:36.935 --> 05:38.469
Throw the chocolate sauce on me.

05:38.537 --> 05:40.371
Okay. MORGAN: Get in there.

05:41.706 --> 05:43.807
Okay.

05:47.946 --> 05:49.813
What does it mean?

05:56.087 --> 05:57.221
Okay.

06:00.492 --> 06:02.126
- Surprise.
- What does it mean?

06:03.228 --> 06:05.396
Oh, I agree, General.

06:05.463 --> 06:06.897
There better be a damn good reason

06:06.965 --> 06:09.099
why they're not picking up the phone.

06:09.167 --> 06:11.168
I'm going to get them right now.

06:12.571 --> 06:13.771
Unprofessional.

06:23.448 --> 06:25.282
What was that?

06:25.350 --> 06:26.884
Oh, my God!

06:28.620 --> 06:30.788
Dad! Hi... What are you doing here?

06:30.855 --> 06:32.623
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

06:34.292 --> 06:36.026
Um, Sarah had these

06:36.094 --> 06:37.595
chocolate-covered, uh... so I was...

06:37.662 --> 06:39.797
Come on, Ch... Chuck, you said I have

06:39.864 --> 06:41.565
the living room for 90 minutes! "Have"?

06:43.969 --> 06:46.570
What do you mean, "have"?

06:46.638 --> 06:49.073
Have... in a biblical way... Um,
we were, um...

06:49.140 --> 06:50.941
not a biblical way,
in a spiritual... Spiritual...

06:51.009 --> 06:54.211
Beckman. Mission. Now.

07:00.719 --> 07:03.287
Happy Valentine's Day, everybody!

It's not a physical thing. It's, you know.

07:47.719 --> 07:49.453
It's-it's an emotional exchange.

07:49.521 --> 07:50.954
Drop it, Grimes.

07:51.022 --> 07:52.990
- We're having company?
- Hey, what the...

07:53.058 --> 07:54.958
Who... who are those guys?

07:55.026 --> 07:57.294
NCS. They're making some...

07:57.362 --> 07:59.096
additions to Castle.

07:59.164 --> 08:00.998
Ooh! Maybe they got my comment card

08:01.066 --> 08:02.466
about the eucalyptus steam room.

08:02.534 --> 08:04.301
They're covert ops, Bartowski.

08:04.369 --> 08:06.403
And they have nothing
to do with your mission.

08:06.471 --> 08:08.539
Tonight, there was supposed to be a joint

08:08.606 --> 08:10.641
CIA/NSA/INTERPOL bust; Alexei Volkoff's

08:10.709 --> 08:12.509
three most trusted lieutenants.

08:12.577 --> 08:14.978
We tracked them down
through his Hydra Network,

08:15.046 --> 08:16.480
but by the time we located them,

08:16.548 --> 08:17.881
they were already dead.

08:17.949 --> 08:19.016
And we believe

08:20.552 --> 08:23.120
Boris Kaminsky. We think Boris may be

08:23.188 --> 08:24.822
trying to take control of Volkoff Industries

08:24.889 --> 08:25.989
by eliminating anyone else

08:26.057 --> 08:27.424
who could make a claim to power.

08:27.492 --> 08:28.892
Is there even anyone left to make a claim?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.027
Possibly.

08:30.095 --> 08:31.795
Volkoff left detailed information

08:31.863 --> 08:33.496
on every contact in the Hydra Network,

08:33.565 --> 08:35.832
except for a woman named Vivian McArthur.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.601
I never heard of her when
I was undercover there.

08:37.669 --> 08:38.902
That doesn't surprise me.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.871
We believe that Volkoff
was purposely hiding her,

08:41.940 --> 08:43.907
because she is his chosen successor.

08:43.975 --> 08:46.043
Which means Vivian is Boris' next target.

08:46.111 --> 08:47.578
Well, do we know anything about her?

08:47.645 --> 08:48.746
The only connection

08:48.813 --> 08:50.414
we have found between her and Volkoff

08:50.482 --> 08:51.915
is a manor in Somerset, England.

08:51.983 --> 08:53.350
There's a party there tonight.

08:53.418 --> 08:54.818
It's a perfect time for Boris to attack.

08:54.886 --> 08:56.220
You need to get to Vivian

08:56.287 --> 08:58.589
before he does and bring her back to Castle.

08:58.656 --> 09:00.858
Uh, quick question, uh, GB.

09:00.925 --> 09:03.761
This party, is there a theme
that we should dress towards?

09:03.828 --> 09:07.164
Step right up!

09:07.232 --> 09:09.933
The ringmaster has arrived.

09:10.001 --> 09:13.604
I'll be taking you through this
little journey this evening.

09:13.671 --> 09:15.272
Step right up! Sarah, I gotta tell you,

09:15.340 --> 09:17.541
masquerades really creep me out, okay?

09:17.609 --> 09:18.542
<i>It's like Eyes Wide Shut,</i>

09:18.610 --> 09:20.177
but, you know, not so boring.

09:20.245 --> 09:22.446
Don't get me wrong,
I'm a huge Kubrick fan. Chuck,

09:22.514 --> 09:24.415
come on. It's just a bunch
of socialites wearing masks.

09:24.482 --> 09:25.516
Yeah, it could be that.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.751
Or, it's a sex-crazed orgy party,

09:27.819 --> 09:29.153
where they don't want
you to see their faces,

09:29.220 --> 09:30.421
or know their secrets.

09:30.488 --> 09:31.755
No, no. I've been to those kinds of parties,

09:31.823 --> 09:33.357
and it doesn't look anything like this.

09:33.425 --> 09:34.691
What? What, what, what, what? Really?

09:34.759 --> 09:36.727
Come on, Chuck, don't be ridiculous.

09:36.795 --> 09:37.928
Look, we've got to find Vivian

09:37.996 --> 09:39.463
before Boris does. You know what that means?

09:39.531 --> 09:41.064
Time to mingle.

09:41.132 --> 09:42.566
Good luck. Huh? No.

09:42.634 --> 09:45.602
Don't you think we should stay together?

09:45.670 --> 09:46.970
Wow.

09:47.038 --> 09:48.972
Do I taste a hint of pear?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.675
Elderflower liqueur with some muddled thyme.

09:51.743 --> 09:53.143
You're an impressive bartender.

09:53.211 --> 09:54.978
It's like you were born to do this, no?

09:56.347 --> 09:57.681
Thanks for the drink.

10:01.786 --> 10:03.854
She's right.

10:03.922 --> 10:05.389
This is fantastic.

10:05.457 --> 10:06.623
Well, it doesn't surprise me. I mean,

10:06.691 --> 10:08.292
with Chuck being a full-blown agent now,

10:08.359 --> 10:09.726
and he and Sarah always taking point.

10:09.794 --> 10:11.929
Kind of leaves you stuck here,
behind the bar.

10:11.996 --> 10:13.597
I'm an integral part of this team.

10:13.665 --> 10:14.731
Excuse me, barkeep.

10:14.799 --> 10:15.732
Might I have an extra lime?

10:15.800 --> 10:16.700
Ah, yes.

10:17.602 --> 10:19.536
Thank you, dear.

10:21.139 --> 10:22.372
And look who's talking.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.974
You live in Charah's apartment.

10:24.042 --> 10:26.310
That is our apartment, okay?

10:26.377 --> 10:28.278
And Chuck and Sarah like having
me there. We have a very...

10:28.346 --> 10:29.913
special dynamic.

10:33.685 --> 10:35.018
Good evening.

10:35.086 --> 10:36.119
I am Charles Carmichael.

10:36.187 --> 10:38.755
Of the Worcestershire Carmichaels.

10:38.823 --> 10:39.890
Who might you be?

10:39.958 --> 10:41.458
I'm a heart.

10:41.526 --> 10:42.459
How darling.

10:42.527 --> 10:44.261
Don't mind if I do. Cheers.

10:50.902 --> 10:52.503
Hello. Enjoying the party?

10:52.570 --> 10:54.171
I am now.

10:54.239 --> 10:56.340
So how do you know Vivian?

10:56.407 --> 10:58.842
We share a mutual friend.

10:58.910 --> 10:59.843
Wake up, Grimes.

10:59.911 --> 11:01.111
You live with an engaged couple.

11:01.179 --> 11:02.479
It's like you're their kid.

11:02.547 --> 11:04.581
What?! That's ridiculous!

11:04.649 --> 11:08.085
Yes, living with a couple
has its hiccups, you know,

11:08.152 --> 11:10.153
but things are actually
really good at the apartment.

11:10.221 --> 11:12.289
Yeah? Well, they won't be that way for long.

11:12.357 --> 11:14.925
You gotta grow up sometime.
Know what I'd do?

11:14.993 --> 11:17.594
I'd go out on top before
the situation gets worse.

11:20.231 --> 11:21.465
So, tell me,

11:21.533 --> 11:23.166
do you know where to find Vivian?

11:23.234 --> 11:27.804
Honestly, I don't even
know what she looks like.

11:27.872 --> 11:29.773
It's the first party she's ever thrown.

11:29.841 --> 11:31.508
Interesting.

11:34.712 --> 11:37.514
H-hot!

11:37.582 --> 11:38.782
Hot-hot-hot-hot!

11:38.850 --> 11:41.151
Good show, good show! Hot!

11:41.219 --> 11:43.687
Hot, but good. Very good! Ah!

11:43.755 --> 11:45.489
Yes, some wine would do good. Mmm!

11:48.560 --> 11:49.626
Please, help yourself.

11:49.694 --> 11:51.328
I'm so sorry.

11:51.396 --> 11:53.363
Was this yours? I can get you another one.

11:53.431 --> 11:55.599
It's okay. I've probably had enough.

11:57.468 --> 12:00.070
I can't stop thinking about
that scene from Eyes Wide Shut.

12:00.138 --> 12:01.505
Yes! Right?

12:01.573 --> 12:04.374
And I like the idea of a
theme party, but you put

12:04.442 --> 12:05.776
these people behind masks

12:05.843 --> 12:06.877
and it's just gets......creepy.

12:06.945 --> 12:08.312
Yeah. And a little sexual.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.480
Yeah.

12:10.548 --> 12:13.483
So, Vivian-- do you know
where she is by any chance?

12:13.551 --> 12:15.085
I haven't had the opportunity
to say hello yet.

12:15.153 --> 12:16.420
I'm sorry, I don't.

12:16.487 --> 12:19.556
But if you do find her, please,
be sure to let me know.

12:19.624 --> 12:23.327
I'd like to thank her for
this exquisite party.

12:30.602 --> 12:32.769
So, how do you, uh, how do you know Vivian?

12:32.837 --> 12:35.238
I don't think anyone really knows her.

12:37.141 --> 12:39.443
And if this was her attempt
to get to know the neighbors,

12:39.510 --> 12:41.211
we can safely say that
she's failed miserably.

12:41.279 --> 12:43.213
Well, at least there's an open bar.

12:43.281 --> 12:46.617
I mean, she got that much right.

12:48.553 --> 12:50.153
Do you know where I can find...?

12:50.721 --> 12:52.021
I found Boris.

12:52.089 --> 12:53.590
Casey, Boris is here.

12:53.657 --> 12:55.525
He's wearing a green mask.

12:55.593 --> 12:56.860
- - We're on it. -

12:56.927 --> 12:58.027
We need to find Vivian.

12:58.095 --> 12:59.829
I think I may have just met her.

13:08.739 --> 13:11.040
Shh. CHUCK: Vivian.

13:11.108 --> 13:12.509
Vivian McArthur?

13:12.576 --> 13:14.043
What are you doing here?

13:14.979 --> 13:16.746
Whoa, what's going on?

13:16.814 --> 13:19.682
Ms. McArthur, we know you're
an associate of Alexei Volkoff.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.851
Alexei Volkoff? What are you talking about?

13:27.324 --> 13:28.925
We're CIA. You need to come with us.

13:28.993 --> 13:30.593
We're here to protect you.

13:30.661 --> 13:31.928
Protect me from what?

13:31.996 --> 13:33.396
Get in the stable!

13:33.464 --> 13:35.031
Stop! Don't move!

13:35.099 --> 13:37.033
Kill the others. Take her alive.

13:40.304 --> 13:41.237
to lose these guys. Okay, we need

13:41.305 --> 13:42.572
What's the best way out of here?

13:42.640 --> 13:43.640
I don't know.

13:43.707 --> 13:45.508
Okay, the house is back that way.

13:45.576 --> 13:48.611
Casey, we're trapped in one
of the stables. Copy that.

13:48.679 --> 13:49.779
We're on our way.

13:49.847 --> 13:51.681
Some things never change.

13:51.749 --> 13:53.449
Come on, Grimes. Let's go.

13:53.517 --> 13:54.751
Let's do this.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.555
What the hell was that?

13:58.622 --> 14:00.223
This can all end now!

14:00.291 --> 14:01.624
Just give me the key, Vivian!

14:01.692 --> 14:03.560
What is he talking about? What key?

14:03.627 --> 14:04.794
Look, I don't know what's going on,

14:04.862 --> 14:06.529
but I have nothing to
do with Alexei Volkoff.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.864
I haven't seen him in years.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.567
Then why does he pay for
the manor that you live in?

14:10.634 --> 14:11.768
Because I'm his daughter.

14:13.270 --> 14:17.140
Vivian, if you want to live,
give me the key.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.275
Look, can you please tell me

14:19.343 --> 14:20.677
what this is all about?

14:20.744 --> 14:22.612
Quick version: your father is
an international arms dealer

14:22.680 --> 14:24.047
and murderer and all-around bad guy, okay?

14:24.114 --> 14:26.649
No, no, my father is an oil executive.

14:26.717 --> 14:28.885
Okay, look, we'll explain it later.

14:28.953 --> 14:31.421
I have an idea. Chuck, get ready to flash.

14:32.489 --> 14:34.724
Those are gunshots!

14:34.792 --> 14:37.126
Sounds like there's gunfire outside!

14:37.194 --> 14:40.096
They're trapped in the
back stables! Come on!

14:42.633 --> 14:43.399
What're you doing?

14:43.467 --> 14:44.567
We're saving you.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.269
No, we're saving you! Get in!

14:50.040 --> 14:53.476
You two are amazing!
You are the best spies in the world!

15:08.044 --> 15:10.011
Good Lord!

15:10.079 --> 15:11.346
What happened to you two?

15:11.414 --> 15:13.348
You smell like vomit and Cheerios.

15:13.416 --> 15:15.250
We had a baby.

15:17.753 --> 15:18.954
We need help.

15:19.021 --> 15:21.156
Follow me.

15:21.224 --> 15:24.659
Luckily, we have a sleep-slash-baby aisle.

15:24.727 --> 15:27.329
You need the new Sleep Sheep.

15:27.396 --> 15:29.764
Look at this.

15:29.832 --> 15:32.701
It says it can record mama's
soothing voice for the baby.

15:32.768 --> 15:35.103
So there you go.

15:40.076 --> 15:42.878
What is that?

15:42.945 --> 15:46.781
I'm sorry, Jeff and Lester
got their hands on one

15:46.849 --> 15:49.317
of these Sleep Sheep and did
some recording of their own.

15:49.385 --> 15:51.520
Jeff has some strange nap habits.

15:51.587 --> 15:53.021
I'll have them shut it off.

15:53.089 --> 15:55.156
No, no, no. No. Thanks for your help.

15:57.293 --> 15:59.694
That's exactly why I got myself snipped.

16:06.769 --> 16:07.702
Babe, that song...

16:07.770 --> 16:08.904
We need that.

16:08.971 --> 16:10.839
Okay, I'll just go ask 'em for it.

16:10.907 --> 16:12.908
Wait, wait, wait! What if they say no?

16:12.975 --> 16:14.209
They can't say no.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.577
We should take it.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.846
Are you sure about this? Oh, yeah.

16:17.914 --> 16:20.181
Good, 'cause I have a plan.

16:26.822 --> 16:29.124
Eleanor Bartowski Woodcomb.

16:29.191 --> 16:30.225
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

16:31.494 --> 16:33.361
Oh, are we not playing that game?

16:33.429 --> 16:34.462
We are not.

16:34.530 --> 16:36.331
Sorry, I came in here to breast-feed.

16:36.399 --> 16:38.833
somewhere else tohnurse. Maybe I could go

16:38.901 --> 16:41.670
Perhaps the back room?

16:43.372 --> 16:45.674
We should follow her.

17:01.290 --> 17:04.526
Well, I believe her.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.027
Everything she says checks out.

17:06.095 --> 17:07.529
I do, too.

17:07.597 --> 17:10.065
It seems like she has no idea
who her father actually is.

17:10.132 --> 17:12.567
I think he lied to her her entire life.

17:12.635 --> 17:14.836
Then why does Boris think
she has this "key"?

17:14.904 --> 17:16.171
I was wondering, is it possible

17:16.238 --> 17:17.806
I could stay with you tonight?

17:17.873 --> 17:19.473
No, no, it's fine. You know, it's just...

17:19.541 --> 17:22.444
they didn't get to enjoy
their Valentine's Day either,

17:22.511 --> 17:24.546
and it's their apartment, too, you know?

17:24.614 --> 17:26.114
Listen, I'll, I'll handle
the paperwork again

17:26.182 --> 17:27.983
if you guys take care of that.

17:28.050 --> 17:30.352
Since you two got engaged,

17:30.419 --> 17:33.588
Mr. Sensitivity might be
feeling a little... irrelevant.

17:33.656 --> 17:35.323
I'll go talk to him.

17:35.391 --> 17:37.192
No, no, let me talk to Morgan.

17:37.259 --> 17:39.828
You debrief Vivian. You know,
if he feels like the third wheel,

17:39.895 --> 17:41.196
maybe it's because the two of us

17:41.263 --> 17:42.530
only ever hang out when you're around.

17:42.598 --> 17:43.932
You know, Morgan and I could use

17:44.000 --> 17:45.967
some one-on-one time.

17:46.035 --> 17:48.236
It'll be fun!

17:48.304 --> 17:49.938
Okay.

17:50.006 --> 17:51.773
Have fun.

17:56.212 --> 17:58.480
Let me ask you a question.

17:58.547 --> 18:01.650
You and I don't usually
do this kind of thing,

18:01.717 --> 18:02.984
so I was just wondering

18:03.052 --> 18:05.787
if there's a reason that you're here.

18:05.855 --> 18:07.656
No! No, no...

18:07.723 --> 18:10.025
I was just looking to...

18:10.092 --> 18:12.193
hang.

18:12.261 --> 18:14.329
Cool, cool. Let's hang.

18:15.431 --> 18:17.265
Okay.

18:22.371 --> 18:25.807
So, uh, I know you guys like
having these toys around...

18:25.875 --> 18:27.909
Toys?

18:27.977 --> 18:29.644
Yeah. Maybe we can play with them.

18:29.712 --> 18:30.879
Roar!

18:30.946 --> 18:32.647
Bang! Bang!

18:33.883 --> 18:35.717
Uh, yeah, sorry, sorry.

18:35.785 --> 18:37.052
No offense, please,

18:37.119 --> 18:40.355
but these, um, they're not toys.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.356
They're collectibles.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.324
They're not for playing. Oh.

18:43.392 --> 18:45.326
Chuck and I had to pool
all our money together

18:45.394 --> 18:46.394
to get these guys.

18:46.462 --> 18:48.430
Original 1977 Kenner line.

18:48.497 --> 18:50.065
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

18:51.767 --> 18:53.702
They're really fun...

18:53.769 --> 18:54.936
to look at.

18:55.004 --> 18:57.005
The trick is

18:57.073 --> 19:00.742
Chewie always goes on Han's right side.

19:02.645 --> 19:06.181
Anyway, I've been arranging them
this way since I was about 13,

19:06.248 --> 19:08.483
if you can believe that.

19:15.357 --> 19:17.726
They're toys! They're just toys,
aren't they?!

19:17.793 --> 19:20.128
No, no, they're collectibles.
They're just toys!

19:20.196 --> 19:21.262
It's different. They have...

19:21.330 --> 19:22.564
value!

19:22.631 --> 19:24.399
No, no, no. No, wait a minute.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.568
Wait, you're not here to hang!

19:26.635 --> 19:28.870
You're here 'cause I'm a third wheel!
Casey was right!

19:28.938 --> 19:32.040
Oh, my God! I play with toys!
I live with a couple!

19:32.108 --> 19:33.441
I am a child!

19:33.509 --> 19:35.076
I'm like your child.

19:35.144 --> 19:37.712
You guys are like my parents. Oh, my God!

19:37.780 --> 19:39.714
No, Morgan, please, it's okay.
Calm down. It's fine.

19:39.782 --> 19:41.382
I mean, look at this. I can't...

19:41.450 --> 19:43.384
I can't do this anymore.

19:43.452 --> 19:45.553
I have to grow up.

19:45.621 --> 19:47.322
I have to move out.

19:47.389 --> 19:49.057
That's what I have to do.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.159
I have to go.

19:51.227 --> 19:54.062
So, my father,

19:54.130 --> 19:55.797
he actually killed people?

19:55.865 --> 19:57.899
Did you spend much time with the man?

19:57.967 --> 19:59.968
Honestly? No.

20:00.035 --> 20:01.803
He put me into more
schools than I can count,

20:01.871 --> 20:03.238
sent me on trips all over the world,

20:03.305 --> 20:05.807
he made sure every minute
of every day was occupied.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.376
But he was never a part of my life.

20:08.444 --> 20:12.514
Or, or, uh, he was trying to protect you

20:12.581 --> 20:15.750
from the very dark and dangerous
world that he was a part of.

20:15.818 --> 20:18.186
Yeah, maybe.

20:18.254 --> 20:21.523
And now you have a chance
to do what you want.

20:21.590 --> 20:22.924
Right.

20:22.992 --> 20:26.528
Now I just have to figure
out what that actually is.

20:26.595 --> 20:29.697
I mean, after the party,
I'm sure we can safely cross

20:29.765 --> 20:32.433
being a socialite off the list.

20:32.501 --> 20:34.435
I can't believe I still don't know

20:34.503 --> 20:36.404
what to do with my life.

20:43.612 --> 20:46.214
Can I not be a spy for a second?

20:46.282 --> 20:47.549
Oh, please.

20:47.616 --> 20:49.350
Okay.

20:49.418 --> 20:51.886
You should have seen my
life a few years ago.

20:51.954 --> 20:54.189
I was working a dead-end job,

20:54.256 --> 20:56.291
I was living with my sister,

20:56.358 --> 20:58.526
and then something...

20:58.594 --> 21:00.461
an opportunity,

21:00.529 --> 21:03.064
<i>just fell in my lap.</i>

21:05.334 --> 21:07.168
Afternoon, Colonel.

21:07.236 --> 21:09.671
Paperwork, bartending,

21:09.738 --> 21:11.806
any chance that your skills
are being wasted here?

21:11.874 --> 21:13.241
You were at the bar.

21:13.309 --> 21:15.310
What are you doing in Castle?

21:15.377 --> 21:17.745
Director Jane Bentley, NCS.

21:17.813 --> 21:20.048
I was in England to observe.

21:20.115 --> 21:22.383
You see, I'm not like
Agents Bartowski or Walker,

21:22.451 --> 21:23.518
even General Beckman.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.286
I see your true potential.

21:25.354 --> 21:26.754
You started working

21:26.822 --> 21:29.424
for the NSA because you were
America's best sharpshooter.

21:29.491 --> 21:30.758
And now...

21:30.826 --> 21:33.394
you're so much more than this, Colonel.

21:33.462 --> 21:35.430
It seemed that your team
doesn't need you anymore.

21:35.497 --> 21:37.565
When are you finally going
to accept that and move on?

21:37.633 --> 21:39.067
Getting to a point?

21:39.134 --> 21:42.670
I'm putting together a new team
and I want you to lead them.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.407
What's the directive?

21:46.475 --> 21:48.610
You're curious. Good.

21:48.677 --> 21:50.144
I'll be in touch.

21:57.820 --> 22:01.022
<i>I never expected this to be my life.</i>

22:01.090 --> 22:04.158
But here I am and--

22:04.226 --> 22:06.628
I'm happy.

22:06.695 --> 22:08.830
And if you give it some time,

22:08.898 --> 22:10.098
I'm sure that

22:10.165 --> 22:12.567
you can find that for you as well.

22:16.572 --> 22:19.073
So what happens now?

22:19.141 --> 22:20.875
Okay, well, now,

22:20.943 --> 22:23.978
probably the best thing to do is
get you into a CIA safe house.

22:24.046 --> 22:25.747
I just told you I spent my entire life

22:25.814 --> 22:27.048
being hidden away by my father.

22:27.116 --> 22:28.216
This is serious, okay?

22:28.284 --> 22:29.784
This is very, very serious business.

22:29.852 --> 22:31.986
Boris has gone after your father

22:32.054 --> 22:34.255
and is taking out everyone
that was close to him.

22:34.323 --> 22:35.857
He knows where you live.

22:35.925 --> 22:38.893
Wait... Okay, so why don't
we use that to our advantage?

22:38.961 --> 22:40.795
What do you mean? Use me as bait.

22:40.863 --> 22:42.497
No. This is the first

22:42.564 --> 22:44.999
opportunity I've had to
take control of my life.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.834
I can't let it slip away.

22:46.902 --> 22:48.303
Charles, I know

22:48.370 --> 22:51.372
it's asking a lot,
and I know that I'm a Volkoff--

22:53.709 --> 22:55.710
Will you help me?

22:58.080 --> 23:00.048
Please?

23:10.392 --> 23:12.460
Yes.

23:13.562 --> 23:15.997
Yes, I'll help you.

23:27.094 --> 23:28.528
Oh, my...

23:28.596 --> 23:30.663
Oh, honey, I think I'm losing my mind.

23:30.731 --> 23:32.498
I know.

23:32.566 --> 23:34.267
I used to love this song.

23:34.335 --> 23:36.502
Okay, it's been two hours.

23:36.570 --> 23:39.839
If I turn it off, do you
think Clara will stay asleep?

23:39.907 --> 23:41.975
It couldn't hurt to try.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.791
Hey, it could be worse.

23:58.859 --> 24:00.159
Really? Could it be?

24:00.227 --> 24:01.728
Hey, we're doctors.

24:01.795 --> 24:04.063
We've gone without sleep before.

24:04.131 --> 24:05.965
We were born for this.

24:06.033 --> 24:08.434
Okay, you're right.

Hey... Morgan, Morgan buddy,

24:30.658 --> 24:32.091
I got... I got to pack for the mission,

24:32.159 --> 24:33.893
but Sarah called me and
said you were moving out.

24:33.961 --> 24:35.495
So I told her that was,
of course, completely...

24:35.562 --> 24:37.430
ridiculous.

24:37.498 --> 24:40.099
No, she's right.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.100
I'm doing it.

24:41.168 --> 24:42.435
I'm gonna move out.

24:42.503 --> 24:43.469
No, but see, that's totally ridiculous.

24:43.537 --> 24:44.804
That's what I'm trying to say...

24:44.872 --> 24:47.340
Morgan, look, I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry about

24:47.408 --> 24:48.975
busting in on you and
Alex on Valentine's Day

24:49.043 --> 24:50.443
with the bearskin rug and the...

24:50.511 --> 24:52.345
That's not the point.
The point is, you had the living room

24:52.413 --> 24:54.647
for 90 minutes. We had a deal,
I broke it. I'm so sorry.

24:54.715 --> 24:56.282
I am not moving out

24:56.350 --> 24:58.017
because of what happened on Valentine's Day.

24:58.085 --> 24:59.919
No, man, I'm--

24:59.987 --> 25:01.621
I'm moving because it's just,

25:01.689 --> 25:03.523
it's been a long time coming, you know.

25:03.590 --> 25:05.358
Neither of us wants to admit it, but...

25:05.426 --> 25:08.294
Admit-- admit what? What do you mean?

25:08.362 --> 25:10.029
Chuck, do you realize--

25:10.097 --> 25:13.199
you and Sarah are going to
be married in a few months?

25:13.267 --> 25:16.302
My friend-- married.

25:17.404 --> 25:18.938
You guys should have your own place.

25:19.006 --> 25:20.006
It's ridiculous.

25:20.074 --> 25:21.474
You should have your own place.

25:21.542 --> 25:23.476
And you know what, I have--
I have a serious girlfriend now.

25:23.544 --> 25:25.378
Who, by the way, takes me seriously.

25:25.446 --> 25:30.349
I just think it's time we both grow up.

25:30.417 --> 25:32.652
We are grown up!

25:32.720 --> 25:34.087
Come on.

25:34.154 --> 25:36.155
Why wouldn't you want to live
with your two best friends?

25:36.223 --> 25:38.057
I'm happy. Aren't you happy? I'm happy.

25:38.125 --> 25:40.426
Of course I'm happy.
But you know what, we were both happy

25:40.494 --> 25:41.961
when your father let us build a fort

25:42.029 --> 25:44.330
in the attic and sleep there all summer.

25:44.398 --> 25:46.299
That was a great summer.

25:46.366 --> 25:48.101
That was a good time.

25:50.571 --> 25:52.739
But things change, and uh...

25:52.806 --> 25:55.074
It's not really a bad thing.

25:55.142 --> 25:58.211
I think it's going to be okay.

26:01.148 --> 26:02.749
Where you going to go?

26:02.816 --> 26:04.617
I don't know.

26:04.685 --> 26:06.586
I got to finish packing up,

26:06.653 --> 26:08.621
and then I'm going to
head out that door, dude,

26:08.689 --> 26:10.957
and I'm just going to open
myself up to the universe.

26:11.024 --> 26:12.291
So, moving to your mom's?

26:12.359 --> 26:13.526
Yeah, yeah.

26:13.594 --> 26:15.128
Pretty much straight over.

26:19.366 --> 26:21.801
Come on, this is okay. This is okay.

26:21.869 --> 26:23.169
Bright side--

26:23.237 --> 26:25.772
this is not going to be
hard to split up, okay?

26:25.839 --> 26:27.406
I've done most of it.

26:27.474 --> 26:28.775
From what I can figure,

26:28.842 --> 26:31.110
original super NES with Donkey Kong-- yours.

26:31.178 --> 26:32.612
Right, sure.

26:32.679 --> 26:37.016
And you'll be taking all
the Hong Kong wire-fu

26:37.084 --> 26:38.951
and Miyazaki flicks, I assume?

26:39.019 --> 26:40.753
You know what happens when you assume.

26:42.656 --> 26:44.123
You're usually correct.

26:44.191 --> 26:45.558
Yeah.

26:45.626 --> 26:48.060
I guess really all that's left

26:48.128 --> 26:50.229
to take into consideration is our, uh...

26:50.297 --> 26:53.566
Han Solo and Chewbacca original '77

26:53.634 --> 26:55.902
Kenner line Collector's edition.

26:59.473 --> 27:01.908
We went in on these together, buddy.

27:01.975 --> 27:04.410
Sure did.

27:04.478 --> 27:06.078
So we just each take one?

27:06.146 --> 27:07.446
No, no. That's crazy talk.

27:07.514 --> 27:08.748
We can't split 'em up.

27:08.816 --> 27:10.416
You can't separate Han and Chewie.

27:10.484 --> 27:12.385
Chewie's Han's first mate

27:12.452 --> 27:14.353
and constant companion.

27:14.421 --> 27:15.755
What up?

27:16.824 --> 27:17.957
Plus, they're worth more--

27:18.025 --> 27:19.625
as a set, so...

27:19.693 --> 27:22.562
So we should sell them.

27:23.697 --> 27:25.765
Look, we don't need to decide right now.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.333
We can sleep on it.

27:27.401 --> 27:28.801
We can decide tomorrow. Totally.

27:28.869 --> 27:31.304
You know, I've got a big
mission ahead of me.

27:31.371 --> 27:33.206
Right. Yeah, sure you do. And you know what,

27:33.273 --> 27:35.141
I have so much more packing to do, and...

27:35.209 --> 27:36.542
So I'll just-- I'll just--

27:36.610 --> 27:38.744
I'll just sleep with him tonight in my room.

27:38.812 --> 27:39.846
Not sleep with him.

27:39.913 --> 27:41.280
I wouldn't sleep with him.

27:41.348 --> 27:43.416
But he's going to be in my room, you know.

27:43.483 --> 27:45.518
And you know, Chewie will just stay with me.

27:45.586 --> 27:46.686
For the night, obviously.

27:46.753 --> 27:48.487
Obviously, obviously.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.431
Okay, then. Okay.

28:19.086 --> 28:20.786
Chuck, is everything okay?

28:20.854 --> 28:23.823
Yeah, yeah.

28:23.891 --> 28:27.226
I was just resting-- stretching.
I was stretching.

28:27.294 --> 28:29.962
I find the wall to have...
It's a lower lumbar thing.

28:30.030 --> 28:31.831
So I'm fine, I'm good.

28:31.899 --> 28:34.166
I'm sorry about Morgan.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.335
It's fine. I'm fine. He's fine.

28:36.403 --> 28:38.237
We're fine, so...

28:38.305 --> 28:39.939
How's the...?

28:40.007 --> 28:41.007
How's the packing

28:41.074 --> 28:42.441
for the mission going? You ready?

28:43.543 --> 28:44.810
Yeah.

28:47.047 --> 28:48.681
<i> Well, if we're going to use</i>

28:48.749 --> 28:50.583
<i>Boris's knowledge of you to our advantage,</i>

28:50.651 --> 28:52.151
we're going to have to know the details.

28:52.219 --> 28:53.653
Walk us through an average day.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.655
We need to figure out when
you're most vulnerable.

28:55.722 --> 28:57.924
Odds are Boris is doing the
exact same thing right now.

28:57.991 --> 28:59.659
I wake up at 6:00.

28:59.726 --> 29:01.060
<i>I make breakfast...</i>

29:01.128 --> 29:03.029
<i>Get dressed...</i>

29:03.096 --> 29:05.364
<i>and then I take Artemis out
for a morning walk.</i>

29:05.432 --> 29:08.668
Hello, Vivian.

29:13.307 --> 29:15.074
How do I look?

29:15.142 --> 29:16.542
You said the details are important, right?

29:16.610 --> 29:17.677
Mm-hmm.

29:17.744 --> 29:19.578
Here.

29:19.646 --> 29:21.681
Wear this.

29:26.787 --> 29:27.887
Are you okay?

29:27.955 --> 29:29.422
Well, shouldn't I be the one

29:29.489 --> 29:31.123
- that goes into the woods?
- Absolutely not.

29:31.191 --> 29:32.658
You should stay here with me,
where it's safe.

29:32.726 --> 29:33.960
Everything's going to be fine. Trust me,

29:34.027 --> 29:35.361
Sarah's had years of training.

29:35.429 --> 29:36.862
And Casey will be watching my every move.

29:40.934 --> 29:42.201
I'm at the north gate.

29:42.269 --> 29:43.369
If Boris attacks,

29:43.437 --> 29:45.171
he'll do it here.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.773
This is it.

29:51.111 --> 29:54.213
Are you sure she'll be all right?

29:54.281 --> 29:57.116
She always is.

30:08.895 --> 30:10.129
Everything looks clear.

30:10.197 --> 30:11.831
I've got a mile until the gate.

30:11.898 --> 30:13.899
I'll be waiting.

30:25.012 --> 30:26.545
It's time.

30:51.444 --> 30:52.378
whoa.

30:55.181 --> 30:56.915
Casey, something's wrong.

30:56.983 --> 30:58.917
I'm coming to you.

31:04.958 --> 31:05.891
Whoa!

31:05.959 --> 31:06.892
Whoa, whoa.

31:08.895 --> 31:10.095
Whoa, whoa.

31:12.065 --> 31:13.299
Whoa!

31:18.038 --> 31:19.705
- - Coming, Walker. -

31:27.547 --> 31:28.914
Sarah?

31:28.982 --> 31:30.649
What's happening? Casey, what's wrong?

31:35.322 --> 31:37.156
Is everything okay? You stay inside.

31:37.223 --> 31:39.658
You shouldn't be out here.
It's too dangerous.

31:39.726 --> 31:41.694
Where's Sarah? Casey, where are you?

31:41.761 --> 31:43.095
60 seconds out.

31:43.163 --> 31:45.197
Stay with Vivian. I'm on my way.

31:45.265 --> 31:47.066
What do you think you're doing?

31:47.133 --> 31:48.167
I'm not doing this anymore.

31:48.234 --> 31:49.835
I'm not letting anyone die for me.

31:49.903 --> 31:52.304
I have spent my whole life hiding, Charles.

31:52.372 --> 31:53.772
It ends today.

31:57.310 --> 31:59.545
All right, let's do this.

32:01.648 --> 32:03.282
It's not Vivian.

32:03.350 --> 32:06.318
Then kill her and find Vivian.

32:06.386 --> 32:08.921
She's the only one who has what we want.

32:21.935 --> 32:23.168
Walker.

32:23.236 --> 32:25.504
Walker?

32:26.740 --> 32:29.174
There's too many of them.

32:29.242 --> 32:31.210
Go and get Chuck. okay? Shut up.

32:31.277 --> 32:33.045
You know I'm not leaving you here.

32:33.113 --> 32:35.881
Let's get you undercover.

32:39.786 --> 32:41.920
The road's just up ahead.
You okay back there?

32:41.988 --> 32:43.021
Yeah-- yeah, yeah.

32:46.893 --> 32:48.260
We got company.

32:49.796 --> 32:53.565
I didn't spend ten years in
equestrian school for nothing.

32:53.633 --> 32:54.800
Hi-yah!

32:54.868 --> 32:56.668
Hi-yah!

33:16.890 --> 33:19.258
Do you think we lost them?

33:19.325 --> 33:21.160
I don't know.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.664
I know. No, we haven't!

33:25.732 --> 33:26.899
Hi-yah!

33:29.235 --> 33:31.170
Go, Artemis, go.

33:31.237 --> 33:32.771
They're gaining on us.

33:32.839 --> 33:33.906
Come on, come on.

33:33.973 --> 33:35.541
Listen, it's only

33:35.608 --> 33:37.643
a matter of time till they catch us.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.144
We're carrying too much weight.

33:39.212 --> 33:40.679
Well, what do you suggest?

33:40.747 --> 33:41.980
Plan B.

33:42.048 --> 33:44.049
Don't stop for anything.

34:14.112 --> 34:15.280
That was kind of cool.

34:15.348 --> 34:16.447
Sarah, Casey,

34:16.516 --> 34:19.051
where are you?

35:09.168 --> 35:10.536
Hey.

35:12.005 --> 35:13.372
Sarah...

35:13.439 --> 35:14.806
Where's Vivian?

35:19.812 --> 35:21.346
Chuck, I've reached the stables.

35:21.414 --> 35:23.081
We're on our way. Good. Stay there.

35:29.289 --> 35:32.524
Vivian.

35:32.592 --> 35:36.862
What do you know,
Alexei Volkoff has a daughter.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.463
Must have taken

35:38.531 --> 35:41.133
a lot of work for them
to keep you under wraps.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.202
Now just give me the key
and I'll make it painless,

35:44.270 --> 35:45.571
I promise.

35:45.638 --> 35:47.205
My father never gave me any key.

35:47.273 --> 35:49.007
Yes, sweetheart, he did.

35:49.075 --> 35:50.375
When you were young.

35:50.443 --> 35:51.944
A token of his affection.

35:52.011 --> 35:54.980
Think hard, Vivian.

35:55.048 --> 35:56.315
Where is it?

35:56.382 --> 35:58.283
I don't know. None of this makes any sense.

35:58.351 --> 36:01.553
My father-- he didn't want me
to be involved in any of this.

36:01.621 --> 36:04.289
Really? You were skeet
shooting at age seven,

36:04.357 --> 36:06.224
had your black belt at 13

36:06.292 --> 36:08.760
and by the time you graduated from
the London School of Economics,

36:08.828 --> 36:10.729
you were fluent in five languages.

36:10.797 --> 36:13.932
Your whole life your
father's been grooming you.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.569
You are his succession plan.

36:17.637 --> 36:20.105
But he was wrong about you.

36:20.173 --> 36:22.074
See, he couldn't recognize

36:22.141 --> 36:24.276
what you really are--

36:24.344 --> 36:26.678
an indecisive, weak

36:26.746 --> 36:28.413
little girl.

36:57.303 --> 36:58.570
Boris would have killed you.

36:58.638 --> 37:00.272
But now he's gone.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.174
And the rest of the lieutenants are dead.

37:02.241 --> 37:05.043
There's no one left to put the pieces
of Volkoff Industries back together.

37:05.111 --> 37:07.245
What happens to it now?

37:07.313 --> 37:09.348
Without a leader, your father's empire

37:09.415 --> 37:11.550
is just an empty office building in Moscow.

37:11.617 --> 37:14.119
Uh, Vivian, did Boris tell
you anything about the key?

37:14.187 --> 37:16.254
What he was looking for?

37:16.322 --> 37:18.256
No, he didn't.

37:18.324 --> 37:19.691
Sorry.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.027
Time to go.

37:23.162 --> 37:24.763
You sure you'll be all right?

37:24.831 --> 37:27.532
Yeah. I can't thank you enough.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.969
For your advice, everything, Charles.

37:31.037 --> 37:34.206
I think it's time I figured out
what to do with the rest of my life.

37:34.273 --> 37:36.274
Well, I'm sure you'll think of something.

37:38.044 --> 37:39.211
Bye.

38:01.701 --> 38:03.835
So this is, uh...

38:06.406 --> 38:08.607
This is it, huh?

38:08.674 --> 38:11.042
Yeah.

38:11.110 --> 38:12.577
Yeah, this is it.

38:15.148 --> 38:17.416
Buddy, I know you're
committed to moving out,

38:17.483 --> 38:20.152
and I get it, but I can't tell you enough

38:20.219 --> 38:22.220
how much Sarah and I love you.

38:22.288 --> 38:24.756
And love having you here.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.626
I love being here.

38:27.693 --> 38:31.463
It would be easy to leave if
things sucked, or you know...

38:31.531 --> 38:33.498
And I need to grow up.

38:33.566 --> 38:36.835
Maybe that means leaving behind
something that's great, too.

38:36.903 --> 38:39.671
The end of an era.

38:39.739 --> 38:42.641
It is indeed.

38:42.708 --> 38:45.343
Obviously, we'll still
have game night, though.

38:45.411 --> 38:47.479
Every Monday.

38:47.547 --> 38:50.849
So what's going to happen
with Han and Chewie, huh?

38:50.917 --> 38:52.751
Where are they? Did you sell them already?

38:52.819 --> 38:54.519
Well, I mean,

38:54.587 --> 38:57.189
Chewie's Han's first mate

38:57.256 --> 38:58.723
and constant companion.

38:58.791 --> 39:01.193
It just didn't seem right to separate them.

39:01.260 --> 39:06.832
More importantly, I thought
they should stay in the family.

39:19.612 --> 39:22.080
You moved her into the nursery?

39:22.148 --> 39:23.348
You think she's ready for that?

39:23.416 --> 39:24.749
Honey, she's three months old.

39:24.817 --> 39:26.818
It's time for Clara to be in her own room.

39:26.886 --> 39:29.054
Besides, she's not alone in there.

39:29.121 --> 39:31.389
Which means, uh, we can be all alone.

39:31.457 --> 39:33.358
I am way ahead of you.

39:33.426 --> 39:36.061
I already have our outfits
laid out and ready to go.

39:36.128 --> 39:38.296
I've been waiting for
this since Clara was born.

39:43.603 --> 39:46.571
<i>I want you to let you know,
I'm not leaving my team.</i>

39:46.639 --> 39:48.173
<i>What I have here is good.</i>

39:48.241 --> 39:50.642
Of course it is, but you've
been here for four years.

39:50.710 --> 39:52.244
Longer than any other assignment you've had.

39:52.311 --> 39:54.112
These people mean a lot to you.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.348
For God's sake, you saved
Agent Walker's life today.

39:56.415 --> 40:00.252
But you're not going to spend the rest of
your career with this team, and you know it.

40:00.319 --> 40:01.686
Sooner or later,

40:01.754 --> 40:03.388
you're going to have to move on, Colonel.

40:03.456 --> 40:05.490
Why not today, when you can go out on top?

40:07.093 --> 40:08.894
I'm not leaving Burbank.

40:08.961 --> 40:11.129
You won't have to.

40:15.001 --> 40:16.401
The mission's right here.

40:33.986 --> 40:36.555
Huh.
