WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:11.044
Oh, this one's
from your mom.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.447
Oh... kitten
in a basket of yarn.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.716
"Dear Niles,

00:17.017 --> 00:19.586
I know we haven't always
gotten along."

00:25.592 --> 00:26.926
Isn't that sweet?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.029
FRASIER:
Hey, Niles

00:29.262 --> 00:31.297
look what I found
in the parking lot.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.566
Hi, Niles.
It's good to see you.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.300
How's he doing?

00:34.801 --> 00:36.669
The doctor says
he's just great.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.505
Well, he looks just great.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.440
(whispers):
Why is he so pale?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.675
(whispers):
He's always this pale.

00:42.942 --> 00:44.477
I'll take those.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.012
Well, Niles,
you've got

00:46.012 --> 00:48.448
quite an impressive
array of flowers here.

00:48.448 --> 00:50.917
Uh... Oh, dear Lord.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.652
Who sent mums?

00:52.952 --> 00:55.021
Those are from Jaime,
our squash valet.

00:55.021 --> 00:55.955
Really?

00:56.289 --> 00:57.357
You know, when I had the flu,

00:57.357 --> 00:58.858
Jaime didn't send me
so much as a card.

00:59.292 --> 01:00.360
You didn't have the flu.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.661
You barely had the sniffles.

01:01.661 --> 01:02.929
I almost threw up.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.330
Who knows?

01:04.330 --> 01:06.232
Mums might have been just
the thing to cheer me up.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.468
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

01:08.468 --> 01:11.137
I'm so sorry you have
to go through all this, Niles.

01:11.137 --> 01:14.040
Oh, I'm pretty used to him by now.

01:14.040 --> 01:14.941
Oh, right...

01:14.941 --> 01:17.811
The... um, yes,
well... thank you.

01:17.811 --> 01:20.346
Who knew all those years
of foie gras and brie

01:20.346 --> 01:22.215
would finally catch up with me.

01:22.515 --> 01:23.583
You know, Frasier,

01:23.583 --> 01:25.085
you might want to get yourself
checked out.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.453
You eat a lot
of that stuff, too.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.788
Yes, but I also drink
a lot of red wine.

01:28.788 --> 01:30.590
Now, Niles,
you'll be happy to know

01:30.590 --> 01:32.425
that your prognosis
is excellent.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.394
I have done some research.
Ah.

01:34.394 --> 01:37.363
I have detailed the procedure
and made copies for each of you.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.298
Here we are.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.100
I also took
the liberty

01:40.100 --> 01:42.035
of checking out your surgeon.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.303
A fine choice.

01:43.503 --> 01:47.073
True, he did have a few brushes
with the law as an undergrad

01:47.073 --> 01:48.541
and I think you all know

01:49.075 --> 01:50.844
how I feel about Tulane's medical school.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.012
But...

01:53.012 --> 01:55.448
on the bright side, he has been
extensively published

01:55.448 --> 01:56.916
and his reputation is stellar.

01:56.916 --> 01:59.385
Now, if you'll all please turn
to page 17 in your handouts.

01:59.886 --> 02:00.854
Where is Dad?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.388
He stepped outside for some coffee.

02:02.388 --> 02:05.391
Oh, I specifically used
laymen's terms for his benefit

02:05.892 --> 02:06.726
Well, all right.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.895
How's he handling all this?

02:08.895 --> 02:10.196
He's positively chirpy.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.132
.
In other words, he's terrified

02:12.132 --> 02:14.067
,
FRASIER:
Yes, when we were kids

02:14.067 --> 02:16.536
whenever one of us
was sick or hurt,

02:16.536 --> 02:18.538
Dad would try to keep us
from worrying

02:19.038 --> 02:21.541
by pretending the problem
didn't even exist.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.910
Nonchalance was his coping mechanism.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.179
Things always turned out
all right, though.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.716
It will this time, too.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.785
How are you holding up?

02:32.785 --> 02:34.287
Well, you know...

02:34.721 --> 02:35.788
You know what?

02:35.788 --> 02:38.258
I think you should think of
something really cool to do

02:38.258 --> 02:40.293
when all this is over--
like a big trip.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.262
That way, you can have something
good to focus on.

02:42.662 --> 02:46.533
I can't think about that
right now.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.403
What the hey?
You still in bed?

02:50.403 --> 02:51.938
It's 9:00
in the morning

02:52.438 --> 02:53.940
Up and at 'em, lazy bones.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.242
Hello, I'm your anesthesiologist, Dr. Ling.

02:56.442 --> 02:57.010
Oh, hello.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.411
How are you
feeling today?

02:58.745 --> 02:59.779
Oh, don't let
this faker fool you.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.214
He's just trying
to get out of work.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.649
,
If you're feeling at all anxious

03:02.649 --> 03:03.650
I can give you
a mild sedative.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.918
No, thanks.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.652
Are you sure, Niles?

03:05.652 --> 03:07.020
Dr. Ling went to Duke.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.658
(phone rings)

03:11.658 --> 03:13.126
Hello?

03:13.126 --> 03:15.628
Can I ask who's calling?

03:15.628 --> 03:17.063
Just a minute, please.

03:17.063 --> 03:17.997
It's Maris.

03:18.498 --> 03:19.966
Do you want me to make up
an excuse?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.350
No, that's okay,
I'll talk to her.

03:23.970 --> 03:24.804
Thank you.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.208
Hello?

03:28.208 --> 03:31.211
Well, yes. How did you hear?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.013
Ah... Jaime is a bit
of a gossip.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.216
Luckily,
they discovered the blockage

03:36.216 --> 03:39.118
before I had a major event.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.120
Well, thank you.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.990
That wasn't the nurse,
that was my wife.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.259
Yes. Daphne.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.661
We were married
a couple of months ago.

03:48.661 --> 03:52.165
.
No, well, uh, that's not really my fault
you didn't know

03:52.165 --> 03:55.001
Sounds to me like your argument
is with Jaime.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.037
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

03:58.538 --> 03:59.038
we didn't invite anyone.

03:59.505 --> 04:00.540
Dr. Ling...

04:03.209 --> 04:05.111
Uh-huh. Uh-huh

04:05.111 --> 04:10.016
Yes, of course we invited him,
he's my brother.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.985
Yes: Williams-Sonoma
and Tiffany's.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.519
Keep it coming.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.358
Now, in just a few moments,

04:19.358 --> 04:21.293
we'll be ready to wheel you down to the O.R.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.662
He'll receive general anesthesia

04:22.662 --> 04:24.163
once he's on
the operating table.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.666
Now, if you'd like to follow
along in your handouts,

04:26.666 --> 04:27.667
I could take you through

04:27.667 --> 04:29.102
the first steps
of the procedure.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.504
The doctor explained everything
to us yesterday.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.506
Yes, but did he have
an mnemonic verse

04:34.007 --> 04:36.376
that goes along to the tune
of "Camptown Races"?

04:36.376 --> 04:37.644
Hello.
Ah...

04:38.077 --> 04:39.145
Dr. Schafer,
I was just explaining

04:39.145 --> 04:40.580
my brother's procedure
to my family.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.482
I'll hand the floor
over to you.

04:42.482 --> 04:43.816
Thank you...?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.585
Frasier...Dr.Crane.

04:45.952 --> 04:46.519
Oh, great.

04:47.020 --> 04:47.520
Once you're under,

04:48.021 --> 04:49.522
we'll begin by
inserting some tubes

04:49.522 --> 04:50.857
to monitor your blood pressure

04:51.124 --> 04:52.692
Then while one team harvests
the saphenous vein

04:53.159 --> 04:54.027
from your right leg,

04:54.027 --> 04:56.195
I'll be opening up your chest.

04:56.195 --> 04:56.996
Excuse me, uh...

04:56.996 --> 04:58.331
If I may, um...

04:58.331 --> 05:00.233
wouldn't a mid-CAB
be less invasive?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.735
I have done some research
into the matter

05:02.735 --> 05:05.672
and I believe that is
the prevailing methodology.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.940
Well, you may have read
about that in Reader's Digest,

05:07.940 --> 05:09.809
but a mid-CAB is
only appropriate

05:09.809 --> 05:11.811
for limited blockages.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.314
My source is not
Reader's Digest.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.182
It is a Harvard colleague.

05:16.182 --> 05:19.552
Harvard being my alma mater.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.054
Harvard!

05:21.554 --> 05:22.555
,
Now, if I'm not mistaken

05:22.555 --> 05:24.957
the blockage is in the left
anterior descending artery.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.392
And the right coronary,

05:26.392 --> 05:27.393
Look, in my expert opinion

05:27.393 --> 05:29.662
I'm doing what's best for this patient.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.397
And my expert opinion
says otherwise.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.398
Well, if you're such an expert,

05:32.899 --> 05:33.900
maybe you should perform
the surgery.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.369
Maybe I should.
Dad.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.172
Frasier, you are not operating
on your brother.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.006
Suit yourself.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.008
LING:
Maybe it would be best

05:42.008 --> 05:43.509
if everyone stepped out

05:43.509 --> 05:45.378
while Dr. Schafer
talks to the patient.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.713
Mrs. Crane,
you're welcome to stay.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.248
Niles, I'll...

05:49.248 --> 05:51.017
I'll see you before
they wheel you in.

05:58.491 --> 05:59.926
Well, I'll tell you one thing

05:59.926 --> 06:01.394
about that Dr. Schafer's
people skills:

06:01.394 --> 06:02.395
I am not a fan.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.930
Oh, will you leave it alone?

06:03.930 --> 06:04.931
You're being a big pain.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.200
Yes, well, I happen
to know a thing or...

06:07.200 --> 06:09.035
a thing or two
about bypass surgery.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.037
He was totally
condescending to me.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.873
He was just trying to
let you know who's in charge.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.708
I'm sure, at the first sign of trouble,

06:15.708 --> 06:17.677
he'll run right out here
to consult with you.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.915
This is so weird.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.418
24 hours ago,
we didn't even know anything

06:25.418 --> 06:26.886
was wrong with Niles.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.855
It just goes to show

06:28.855 --> 06:30.723
you can't take a second
for granted.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.158
Sure can't.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.660
Can't take people for granted, either.

06:34.660 --> 06:35.661
You just never know.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.063
It's true.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.999
That's why you should always
tell the people you love

06:40.500 --> 06:41.968
just how much
they mean to you.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.871
Well, I hope you guys know
how much I care about you.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.272
Oh, geez, sure we do.

06:46.272 --> 06:47.774
And we care about you, too, Roz.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.142
Of course, Roz;
you're like family.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.376
And, Dad...

06:50.376 --> 06:51.744
I hope you know I love you

06:52.245 --> 06:53.646
even at your most difficult.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.114
Well, I love you, too, son,

06:55.615 --> 06:57.617
even when you treat me
like a child.

06:57.617 --> 07:01.320
Frasier bosses everyone around--
it's just his way.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.655
Perhaps if people
behaved more competently,

07:02.655 --> 07:03.589
I wouldn't be so bossy.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.024
Maybe you wouldn't be so bossy

07:05.024 --> 07:06.959
if you didn't always focus on how everybody else behaves.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.928
That'd be the day.
Yes, well, maybe
that's because

07:08.928 --> 07:10.196
human behavior is my profession.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.365
n take a day off
once in a while.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.065
No kidding.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.967
Who asked you, Roz?

07:14.967 --> 07:17.937
Niles is going off
to surgery soon.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.705
Come and wish him well.

07:19.705 --> 07:22.508
You know...
we really should tell her

07:22.508 --> 07:24.911
how much
she means to us, too.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.346
How are you feeling?

07:27.346 --> 07:29.348
I'm a little woozy.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.851
Maybe I should lie down.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.354
Oh, now, Daphne, you know
all the important papers

07:35.354 --> 07:37.256
are in my top
left-hand drawer...

07:37.256 --> 07:39.659
DAPHNE:
Let's not talk
about that right now.

07:39.659 --> 07:40.593
You just relax.

07:40.593 --> 07:44.030
Okay, Daphne.

07:44.030 --> 07:47.533
You know, Daphne, they do these
procedures hundreds of times.

07:47.533 --> 07:48.534
I know

07:49.035 --> 07:51.471
Okay. It's practically
routine, Daphne.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.907
Why do you keep saying my name?

07:54.907 --> 07:57.910
I just want to say it
as many times as I can.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.312
Daphne.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.483
What? Still in bed?

08:03.683 --> 08:04.750
Look at this goldbrick

08:04.750 --> 08:07.253
Well, if you're going to be loafing around all day,

08:07.253 --> 08:09.522
you might as well
have something to read.

08:09.522 --> 08:13.359
I know how you love
your Archies.

08:13.359 --> 08:15.194
Thanks, Dad.

08:15.194 --> 08:18.798
Oh, a Jughead Double Digest.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.603
.
I'll be here waiting for you

08:23.603 --> 08:25.071
I love you, son.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.473
I love you, too.

08:29.876 --> 08:30.810
Frasier.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.246
I have a confession to make.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.746
Hmm?

08:34.746 --> 08:37.250
Remember when we were kids and
I was wearing your opera cape

08:37.750 --> 08:39.085
and you pushed me
down the stairs?

08:39.085 --> 08:41.453
Yes.

08:41.453 --> 08:45.725
You didn't push me.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.527
I jumped.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.863
I was trying to fly
like a Valkyrie.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.166
That's not important right now

08:54.166 --> 08:57.570
The important thing is
that you get well, all right?

08:57.570 --> 08:59.572
Dr. Crane, Mrs. Crane, it's that time.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.007
Ooh.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.442
Okay, we're going to need you
to slide over.

09:03.442 --> 09:07.246
Boy, the hospital's an
interesting place, isn't it?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.515
How so, Niles?
Oh

09:09.882 --> 09:12.852
all roads lead to the hospital.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.789
We're born here,
we get sick here,

09:17.290 --> 09:20.226
and we get well here..

09:20.593 --> 09:22.595
always these big, dramatic moments

09:22.595 --> 09:25.665
and the hospital
just gobbles them up.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.937
You think a hospital
has memories?

09:31.437 --> 09:33.439
I bet it does.

09:33.439 --> 09:36.442
I bet when I walked in,
it thought...

09:36.442 --> 09:38.945
"Oh, you again.

09:38.945 --> 09:42.448
"You're the little boy
who broke his leg in 1966.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.451
Hello, old friend."

09:45.952 --> 09:48.454
Wow, a talking hospital.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.957
That would be cool.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.292
When are these drugs
going to kick in?

09:53.526 --> 09:55.094
I don't know
why I need surgery...

09:55.595 --> 09:57.096
this is the best I've felt in years.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.064
Easy... easy...

09:58.464 --> 10:00.900
Daphne, Daphne, Daphne,

10:03.936 --> 10:05.471
Okay, you ready to take
a little trip

10:05.972 --> 10:06.906
I think he already is.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.708
Can I just have a second?

10:08.708 --> 10:10.643
Of course.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.982
I'll be here
when you wake up.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.350
Promise?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.851
I promise.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:45.177 --> 10:46.679
What do you mean you
don't like Archie?

10:47.179 --> 10:48.180
It's a riot.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.183
You got your Jughead, your
Reggie, your Mr. Weatherbee.

10:53.185 --> 10:54.220
Please, stop crying, Maris.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.689
The doctor can always
cut off more next time.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.698
I'll be here when you wake up.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.233
Promise?

11:07.733 --> 11:08.734
Promise.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.019
MARTIN
: How come these places

11:27.019 --> 11:29.321
never have any
magazines for men?

11:29.588 --> 11:35.561
It's all hairdos
and recipes and butt exercises.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.964
I was just thinking
about what Niles said
about the hospital

11:38.964 --> 11:40.966
and the things
that happen here.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.735
Oh, geez, would you
look at this:

11:42.935 --> 11:45.805
"Ten Saucy Secrets
To Please Him In Bed."

11:45.805 --> 11:47.406
You know damn well
there are only four.

11:47.406 --> 11:50.976
The rest are just do-si-dos.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.779
It's like the whole
tapestry of life

11:53.779 --> 11:57.116
keeps replaying itself
within these walls.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.819
I used to bust people
for that one.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.120
You didn't hear a word
I said, did you?

12:01.620 --> 12:02.488
Yeah, I did.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.791
"Hospital...
tapestry of life."

12:06.292 --> 12:09.729
Whoa, that's a nice kitchen.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.631
.
You're a sentimental fool, Dad

12:14.133 --> 12:15.167
Well, here he is.

12:15.634 --> 12:18.671
Frasier, say hello
to your new brother.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.673
I don't like him.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.446
(chuckles)

12:27.446 --> 12:30.316
Remember when you were little
and you convinced Niles

12:30.316 --> 12:32.818
that we were all figments
of his imagination?

12:33.319 --> 12:34.754
The whole world was just
in his mind?

12:34.754 --> 12:38.190
I told him we disappeared
whenever he left the room.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.025
For months afterwards,

12:40.025 --> 12:41.861
he was always
darting into rooms

12:41.861 --> 12:44.363
to make sure we were
all still there.

12:44.363 --> 12:45.364
Scared the crap
out of me.

12:45.865 --> 12:46.866
I was ready
to kill you.

12:47.299 --> 12:48.367
What made you think of that?

12:48.801 --> 12:49.869
I don't know.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.371
Just thinking about Niles.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.510
Well, he must be all right.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.444
We're all still here.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.883
I don't think I've ever
been this frightened

13:03.883 --> 13:05.384
in my whole life.

13:05.384 --> 13:08.387
Well, Daph, according
to my timetable,

13:08.387 --> 13:11.690
Niles is probably
off the bypass pump by now.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.293
All the blockages
have been bypassed

13:14.493 --> 13:17.062
and the myocardium
is now receiving normal blood.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.564
How come you
know all this,

13:18.564 --> 13:20.933
but you're stumped by an electric
barbecue fork?

13:21.200 --> 13:24.670
Because the human heart was not
designed by some idiot in Japan.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.572
You know, Frasier,

13:26.972 --> 13:29.809
maybe now's not the perfect time to go into detail.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.043
It's all right, Roz.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.545
You see, she knows.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.481
Knowledge is our ally
against anxiety.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.883
Which happens to be the theme
for today's Best of Crane

13:37.883 --> 13:39.418
which is being broadcast
over the airwaves

13:39.418 --> 13:40.719
right this moment.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.589
Oh, yeah. They're piping it into the operating room

13:43.589 --> 13:44.890
instead of using anesthesia.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.060
Very funny, Roz.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.429
Oh, I hope the doctors
have their earplugs in,

13:50.429 --> 13:51.831
so they don't
fall asleep, too.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.232
All right, we get it.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.201
Seriously, if I was ever
going to rob a bank

13:55.201 --> 13:56.669
and I wanted to knock out
the guards...

13:56.669 --> 13:58.604
All right, Roz.

14:07.613 --> 14:10.015
Hey, is that
a Chunky in there?

14:12.418 --> 14:13.786
Looks like one.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.655
It's been a long time
since I seen one of those.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.591
What are they asking for it?

14:18.591 --> 14:23.662
Looks like it's 85 cents.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.098
Does it only take
the exact change?

14:26.098 --> 14:29.935
Looks like there's
a dollar slot.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.738
All I have is a ten.

14:32.738 --> 14:33.572
Will it take a ten?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.307
Get off your ass
and look.

14:36.575 --> 14:37.977
They usually just take singles.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.145
Anybody have a single?

14:42.948 --> 14:44.783
How can you think
about eating now?

14:44.783 --> 14:47.419
What would you rather
have me thinking about?

14:47.419 --> 14:48.254
I'll get you some change.

14:48.754 --> 14:49.755
Oh, thanks, Roz.

14:49.755 --> 14:54.193
I've been sitting
way too long, anyway.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.695
Excuse me... Colleen.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.498
Do you have any ones?

14:59.498 --> 15:00.733
I think so.
Let me check.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.168
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

15:03.669 --> 15:06.005
Yes. There's something
wrong with my baby.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.741
She has a little rash
on her cheek.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.142
I looked in the book

15:10.142 --> 15:12.077
and I don't think
it's chickenpox.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.446
But it does look
a little like scarlet fever.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.348
Is this your first child?

15:16.348 --> 15:17.283
Yes. Why?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.218
I think
this is lipstick.

15:19.218 --> 15:20.219
Would a five help?

15:20.719 --> 15:22.087
No, I'm afraid I need ones.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.455
Oh, thank God.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.457
Oh, look at that.

15:25.457 --> 15:28.260
That's probably
how it happened.

15:28.494 --> 15:33.032
Thank you.
Colleen, I won't forget you.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.367
I'm sorry.
All I've got are fives.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.635
Oh, thanks, anyway.

15:36.635 --> 15:37.536
Do I know you?

15:37.903 --> 15:39.471
I don't think so.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.807
Are you sure?

15:42.107 --> 15:44.009
Trust me, I'm really good with faces. Thanks.

15:45.911 --> 15:46.879
Mrs. Crane?
Yes?

15:46.879 --> 15:48.380
Your husband's
doing well.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.883
He's off the pump
and his heart is
beating on its own.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.384
FRASIER:
How's his blood pressure?

15:52.384 --> 15:53.218
100/60.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.586
Could be better.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.089
Did you thoroughly suction
the cardioplegic solution?

15:57.589 --> 15:58.490
You see, I'm a doctor.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.392
Oh, yes, Dr. Schafer told me
about you.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.895
He said if you started
asking me questions,

16:02.895 --> 16:04.196
I should do this.

16:06.999 --> 16:11.003
Oh, I get it.
Very nice.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.505
Well, that's
good news, right?

16:13.505 --> 16:14.506
Oh, yeah, great.

16:14.506 --> 16:15.307
They didn't have
any change.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.109
Oh, shoot.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.822
What you reading, Daph?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.591
I have no idea.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.594
I must have read
the same paragraph ten times.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.463
I don't know how
you're getting through this.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.365
Well, it's not like the old days

16:39.365 --> 16:41.867
when heart surgery
was a big thing.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.369
Nowadays, they
do it so much,

16:43.369 --> 16:45.371
it's like going in for a haircut.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.173
You read the paper and
wait till he's done.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.275
But aren't you scared?

16:53.979 --> 16:56.849
Uh, I wonder if that
guy has a dollar.

16:56.849 --> 17:03.288
I bet he does.
Excuse me.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.290
Oh, no!

17:06.290 --> 17:07.291
What, Daph?

17:07.291 --> 17:09.261
I don't believe this.
Excuse me.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.262
What?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.263
I was supposed to bring
Niles's cell phone

17:12.765 --> 17:14.299
in case any of his
patients called

17:14.299 --> 17:16.068
so I could refer them
to Dr. Wells.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.303
Now, I'm going to be calling
his stupid cell phone

17:18.303 --> 17:20.172
every two minutes
to check his mailbox.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.007
Here, let's use
my cell phone, all right?

17:22.007 --> 17:23.409
We can take turns calling.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.778
He asked me to do
this one simple thing

17:26.278 --> 17:28.280
and I forgot.
I'm such an idiot.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.282
Don't go beating yourself up.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.284
You didn't do
anything wrong.

17:32.284 --> 17:35.287
Come on.
I'll dial first.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.289
Now, look, Niles,
as far as Dad knows

17:37.289 --> 17:39.792
I had nothing to do
with your leg breaking, right?

17:40.292 --> 17:41.160
You pushed me.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.028
Yes, and in exchange
for your silence,

17:43.028 --> 17:44.029
you'll get ten
of my records.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.030
Any ones you want.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.032
Even the Shostakovich?

17:47.032 --> 17:48.033
Not that one.

17:48.534 --> 17:49.501
Then forget it.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.970
Okay, fine.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.039
Sign here
and initial here.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.278
You still in bed, Mr. Lazybones?

17:59.611 --> 18:01.180
If you're going to lie around all day

18:01.180 --> 18:02.681
I got you something to read.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.183
The Charterhouse of Parma?

18:04.683 --> 18:06.185
Better. Archie.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.621
Well, hello, Chunky.

18:09.621 --> 18:10.589
I beg your pardon?

18:10.956 --> 18:12.491
Got some change.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.026
Congratulations.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.570
Hey, is that
a Marathon bar?

18:25.003 --> 18:26.972
Oh, geez, now I don't know
what to get.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.340
You should go with your
first instinct, Dad.

18:28.841 --> 18:29.842
I haven't had
a Marathon bar in years.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.210
All right, then
get a Marathon bar.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.578
Come to think of it,

18:32.578 --> 18:35.047
I think they quit making
Marathons back in the '80s.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.550
Then you should get a Chunky.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.052
Uh, although...

18:40.052 --> 18:41.553
I kind of want
to get a Marathon bar

18:41.553 --> 18:42.821
just to see what
it looks like
on the inside.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.089
All right,
just get the Chunky!

18:44.089 --> 18:46.892
All right.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.160
Hey!
What?

18:48.627 --> 18:50.129
It's stuck!

18:50.129 --> 18:51.663
Oh, great,
you had to have Chunky!

18:52.164 --> 18:53.665
Oh, fine! All right!
I'll get it!

18:55.167 --> 18:57.002
What is going on?

18:57.002 --> 18:58.237
We have a stuck Chunky.

18:58.237 --> 19:01.240
Why did Chunky
stick his arm in there?

19:01.240 --> 19:05.210
Not me, the candy.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.713
Oh, I give up.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.714
Don't worry, Martin.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.716
I'll stop by tomorrow
and get us some Godiva.

19:11.216 --> 19:13.719
But I want my Chunky.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.220
Excuse me.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.395
Chunky, was it?

19:29.401 --> 19:30.402
Oh, oh, Daphne.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.437
It's okay.
It's okay.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.773
Everything's going
to be fine.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.441
Do I need to call security here?

19:36.441 --> 19:37.809
Uh, no, it's all right.

19:37.809 --> 19:38.744
I'm sorry about this.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.078
Kind of a tough time.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.413
All right, but keep
this area clear

19:41.413 --> 19:42.915
until I can get it cleaned up.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.384
Right. And we'll pay for this.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.653
I already paid for this.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.925
Daphne, I know
you're in hell right now,

19:52.925 --> 19:54.927
but in just about
20 minutes,

19:54.927 --> 19:58.430
comes the disconnecting
of the ventilator
and the extubation.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.933
You can see it all
in the diagram
on page 24-C.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.900
He's not a diagram!

20:01.900 --> 20:03.402
He's my husband

20:03.402 --> 20:05.404
and he's on a table
with his chest cut open!

20:05.404 --> 20:08.907
I'm sorry if I can't handle
this as well as the rest of you,

20:08.907 --> 20:10.409
but I'm terrified!

20:10.409 --> 20:12.711
Daphne, it's okay.
Just calm down.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.479
When all this is over...

20:14.479 --> 20:16.448
There is no
"when this is over"!

20:16.448 --> 20:19.351
There's no tomorrow,
no next week, no next year!

20:19.351 --> 20:21.853
There's nothing until
he comes out of there

20:21.853 --> 20:23.121
and I know he's okay!

20:24.456 --> 20:25.924
Daphne...

20:25.924 --> 20:27.759
Why don't you sit down, son?

20:33.665 --> 20:36.134
Nobody meant anything.

20:36.134 --> 20:39.137
It's hard as hell for
all of us to be here.

20:39.638 --> 20:42.641
I know. It's just...

20:43.141 --> 20:44.142
I hate hospitals.

20:44.643 --> 20:45.444
I hate them.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.613
I hate all of this.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.947
I know.

20:54.953 --> 20:58.957
.
I'm afraid your wife's X rays don't look good

21:11.003 --> 21:13.505
Waiting is the hardest part.

21:20.512 --> 21:23.015
Niles...

21:23.015 --> 21:24.516
you did great.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.020
The doctor said
it went even better
than he expected.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.522
I'm so proud of you.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.024
He'll be out all night.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.027
Why don't you get
something to eat?

21:35.027 --> 21:38.030
I'll be here
when you wake up.

22:18.537 --> 22:21.540
Say hello to your new sister.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.544
Look, she's smiling at you.
