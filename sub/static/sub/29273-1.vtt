She just fall back 'cause she know
I need my space, all right?

12:05.726 --> 12:08.353
She let me be out here on the streets

12:09.521 --> 12:10.439
No big deal.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.356

12:19.823 --> 12:23.285
Ain't no more money to be made in here.
It's wall-to-wall chicks, a'ight?

12:50.646 --> 12:53.106
Oh, yo, Quan, you should go inside, man.

Thank you.
You look like a Puerto Rican Rock.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.580
[Quan] Man, whatever.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.374
Fire him.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.835

Come on.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.128

-That's my business.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.172

Look at all these hoes out here.

13:33.564 --> 13:34.982
And you lock yourself down?

13:35.899 --> 13:39.987
It's an oasis of hoes
in every city we go to.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.905
-Pfft!
-I'm not about that life, man.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.407

I love you, too, Dom.

15:12.663 --> 15:14.665
I don't deserve you, either,
and I know that.

You don't, but you'll keep

I tried calling you a few times,

we could just not reconnect.

-[Quan] Uh, come here.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.404
Have you heard from Dom at all?

20:37.487 --> 20:40.532
No. He's not picking up his phone,
and I don't know where he is.

right now for Sosa,

20:44.870 --> 20:46.163

Okay. I'm gonna figure something out,
okay?

20:49.666 --> 20:52.461
Let me know.
Just let me know, a'ight?

20:52.544 --> 20:53.712
All right.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.674
Hi. Excuse me.

20:57.758 --> 20:58.842
What room is Sosa in?

20:58.926 --> 21:01.470
One moment. Room 102.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.434
[Zoe] Hi.
Do you have any updates on my husband?

21:07.518 --> 21:10.562
-Who?
-Dom D. He and Sosa were together.

21:10.646 --> 21:12.231
[Hardaway]
Yeah, I'm Sheriff Hardaway.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.607
And I'm sorry, right now,

21:13.690 --> 21:16.527
we don't currently have any information
on his whereabouts.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.903
What?
What do you mean?

21:17.986 --> 21:18.820
Well, right now,

21:18.904 --> 21:21.740
we're actually just looking
into the assault of this young man.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.909
Okay, but he's missing.

21:23.992 --> 21:24.993
[Hardaway]
We don't know that.

21:25.577 --> 21:30.332
I mean, my report simply has him fleeing
the crime scene in his SUV.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.085
Right, okay, um... can you track it?

21:33.585 --> 21:36.505
-The tracking chip has been disabled.
-The cameras in the club.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.298
Sylvester's is a raggedy warehouse.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.967
Okay, so basically,
you can't help me.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.010
No, no, I'm not sayin' that.

21:42.094 --> 21:44.638
All I'm sayin' is we don't have
any information currently.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.432
But what I can tell you
is that your husband

21:47.516 --> 21:50.018
could possibly be a person of interest.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.396
Excuse me?

21:53.105 --> 21:54.690
Yes, Mr. Dominic,

actually returned to the parking lot

where they found Mr. Taylor here

22:02.614 --> 22:04.783
on the ground
after being assaulted.

22:04.867 --> 22:05.993
Okay, but...

22:06.076 --> 22:08.579
Dom was taken.
Dom wouldn't just leave.

22:08.662 --> 22:11.832
[Hardaway] No, that doesn't mean that.
There's no evidence of that, ma'am.

22:11.915 --> 22:15.002
What I can tell you is that
there were several witnesses in the club

22:15.085 --> 22:17.171
who saw both men in a heated argument

22:17.254 --> 22:20.924
-and Mr. Driver stormed off--
-I don't care who said they saw what.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.926
Okay?
That's not even what happened.

22:24.136 --> 22:25.304
Well...

22:25.846 --> 22:27.097
I don't know what to tell you

22:27.181 --> 22:30.267
other than that there are only
two people who can attest to that.

22:30.350 --> 22:34.354
And one of them is here in a coma,
and the other is unaccounted for.

22:36.690 --> 22:37.774
[sighs]

22:39.985 --> 22:41.528
I'm just trying to find my husband.

22:43.238 --> 22:44.364
I understand.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.992
And all I can tell you is,

22:47.659 --> 22:51.330
when I know more,
I promise, you'll know more.

22:55.709 --> 22:56.877
I need to see Sosa.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.712
Sorry, ma'am,
I can't let you go in there.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.840
No one but hospital personnel
is allowed in this room.

23:05.636 --> 23:06.637
Please?

23:11.266 --> 23:12.309

can you notify me?

[breathing heavily]

26:16.034 --> 26:17.244
Why are you doing this to me?

26:17.327 --> 26:18.787
You forgot about me, Dom,

26:19.788 --> 26:20.998
and you lost your way.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.541
Now look at your career.

26:22.624 --> 26:23.625
It's pathetic.

26:23.709 --> 26:26.044
You should be thanking me, Dom.

26:26.128 --> 26:27.546
I saved you.

26:27.629 --> 26:30.883
I saved you from continuing down
this destructive path that you were on,

26:30.966 --> 26:33.260
and I saved you
from the slutty girls at the bar.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.637
You should be thanking me.
I saved you, baby.

in person?

Ah, well, I don't date any rappers
or celebrities of any kind.

It's not who I am.

Come on, now.
You're gonna put me on the spot?

-Yeah, you're right, but...
-You know what?

-How 'bout you just go back to L.A.?
-I'm not leaving you here by yourself.

Just go back, handle the business.
Make sure the record company is cool.

33:43.065 --> 33:44.525
he's Dom D's manager, right?

33:45.275 --> 33:47.152
-Yeah.
-Did he have a show here?

33:47.236 --> 33:49.321
-He did.
-Oh, man, I missed it.

-I don't know nothing.
-Right. Yeah, I understand.

Do you recall anything out
of the ordinary?

-Anything.

in the bathroom.

38:30.310 --> 38:31.562
[sighs]

38:31.645 --> 38:32.938
Alexis Carrigan.

38:33.522 --> 38:36.275
But I haven't seen her
since senior year in high school.

38:36.358 --> 38:38.402
-Do you know why?
-'Cause she's psycho.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.529
And she actually said that I hit her?

38:40.612 --> 38:42.406
She just straight attacked me
out of nowhere.

38:42.489 --> 38:45.534
-And you didn't call the police?
-Look, I was drunk and high, okay?

38:45.617 --> 38:47.536
I thought I would get in trouble, too.

38:47.619 --> 38:48.787
I panicked.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.456
Besides, that bitch Alexis
is really crazy.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.916
What do you mean by "crazy"?

38:53.500 --> 38:57.212
She showed up in the middle of senior year
of high school, out of nowhere.

38:57.296 --> 38:59.214
Pretty girl, new girl,
but just weird.

38:59.298 --> 39:01.008
-Weird like how?
-Like stalker weird.

39:01.091 --> 39:03.051
She always had some crazy look
in her eye.

39:03.135 --> 39:04.469
She was super clingy.

39:04.553 --> 39:07.806
She was "fan-girling" all the celebrities
and totally got clowned for it,

39:07.890 --> 39:08.724
but she didn't even care.

39:08.807 --> 39:12.561
She went as far as telling everybody
she dated all these famous people.

39:12.644 --> 39:15.689
Oh, and Dom D?
Said he got her pregnant.

39:17.232 --> 39:20.194
Um... she's... she was pregnant?

39:20.277 --> 39:22.362
I don't know.
That's just what she said.

39:23.155 --> 39:25.449
So when I saw the bitch in the club,

39:25.532 --> 39:28.160
I should have known
that she was gonna do something crazy.

39:28.744 --> 39:31.705
Bitch, just wait till I find that girl.
I'm gonna make her pay...

39:31.788 --> 39:33.457
I, I'm sorry.
Did she have the baby?

39:33.540 --> 39:35.292
Girl, I told you, I don't know.
I don't talk to that ho.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.627
You got a picture?

39:36.710 --> 39:37.920
Uh...

39:38.462 --> 39:40.255
I think I have my yearbook.
Let me see.

39:45.427 --> 39:49.389
[suspenseful music]

39:54.895 --> 39:55.771
That's her?

39:55.854 --> 39:57.606
There go the psycho bitch right there.

39:59.191 --> 40:00.108
Thank you.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.614
[door opens and closes]

40:08.867 --> 40:12.788
[Lexi] I used to have to push my father
around in a chair just like this...

40:13.497 --> 40:16.041
after he got so weak,
he couldn't do it for himself.

40:16.834 --> 40:19.002
So I'm used to it.
Don't feel sorry for me.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.921
[chuckles]

40:21.004 --> 40:22.965
Oh! Sorry.

40:23.048 --> 40:24.591
This place is a mess.

40:24.675 --> 40:26.927
Dad was always working on projects.

40:28.053 --> 40:30.055
You know, he taught me so much about cars.

40:30.806 --> 40:31.807
[sighs and chuckles]

40:31.890 --> 40:34.768
At one point, I really thought
that he wanted me to be a mechanic.

40:34.852 --> 40:36.144
[chuckles] Isn't that funny?

40:37.312 --> 40:38.897
[chains rattling]

40:40.190 --> 40:41.400
In there.

40:42.901 --> 40:45.612
All right.
You're on there.

40:45.696 --> 40:47.072
Okay.

40:47.155 --> 40:50.200
Well, you'll be more comfortable here
and less tempted to act up.

40:50.284 --> 40:52.035
[giggles] All right.
I'll be back.

41:18.353 --> 41:19.646
Hey, Timothy.

41:20.147 --> 41:21.315
Hey, it's Zoe.

41:21.398 --> 41:23.734
Um, I just need a really big favor.

41:23.817 --> 41:27.446
Can you get me information
on an Alexis Carrigan from Maryland?

41:28.238 --> 41:30.032
Just anything you can get.

41:30.115 --> 41:31.491
All right.
Thank you.

41:44.713 --> 41:45.881
Hey. What's up?

41:48.008 --> 41:49.259
[sighs]

41:51.178 --> 41:52.054
You got it?

41:52.804 --> 41:53.805
I don't know about this.

41:53.889 --> 41:56.808
Something's not right.
You and I both know this.

41:58.060 --> 41:59.228
[sighs heavily]

41:59.311 --> 42:02.105
Look, just be careful, all right?

42:02.689 --> 42:05.442
I know how to handle this better than you.
Trust me.

Oh, good.
You're awake.

42:30.509 --> 42:31.593
[giggles]

42:31.677 --> 42:33.136
Okay, I was thinking,

42:33.220 --> 42:35.556
and I was just hoping
that we could put the past behind us

42:35.639 --> 42:37.474
and focus on getting you better.

42:37.558 --> 42:38.725
-[sighs]
-Can we do that?

42:39.309 --> 42:41.144
[clanging]

42:42.312 --> 42:44.147
I'm sorry.
It's the only thing I could think of

42:44.231 --> 42:46.191
to keep you from hurting yourself.

42:46.775 --> 42:47.776
[groans]

42:47.860 --> 42:48.902
Gotta eat.

42:48.986 --> 42:51.697
My folks are gonna be looking
for me, okay?

42:52.531 --> 42:55.158
I gotta get back to S-Sosa.

42:55.242 --> 42:56.910
Baby, you gotta eat.

42:56.994 --> 42:58.537
The only thing you need now is food.

42:59.705 --> 43:02.040
These are the best fries in town.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.293
Come on.

43:06.753 --> 43:07.713
Dom, baby, what's wrong?

43:09.381 --> 43:11.425
You know you need food
for strength, right?

43:15.179 --> 43:18.182
Dom, do you want me
to put the I.V. back in?

43:18.265 --> 43:20.058
[Dom] You know what's wrong with me!

43:20.142 --> 43:22.477
You got me down here caged up
like an animal!

43:23.187 --> 43:25.564
Soon as I get out of here, I'ma kill you,
I promise you that.

43:25.647 --> 43:27.274
[laughs] No, you're not.

43:27.774 --> 43:29.276
You love me too much to hurt me.

43:30.277 --> 43:31.111
Listen...

43:32.404 --> 43:33.405
if this is gonna work,

43:33.488 --> 43:36.116
we have to work on communicating
a lot better than we have

43:36.200 --> 43:37.659
over the past few years, okay?

43:37.743 --> 43:40.078
I know what's gonna make you feel better.

43:40.162 --> 43:41.330
Some of your things.

and with pride.

I saw you on social media
on your wedding day.

45:27.269 --> 45:28.812
That was supposed to be me!

45:29.605 --> 45:31.398
That was supposed to be me, Dom!

45:32.065 --> 45:35.235
You think you can just smash
and forget about me?

This is Sheriff Hardaway
from the hospital.

I just wanted to call and offer
my most sincere condolences

45:54.213 --> 45:55.964
-regarding the loss of your friend.
-Thank you.

45:56.048 --> 45:57.841
By chance, have you spoken
with your husband at all?

45:57.925 --> 46:00.761
No. I'm-- I'm driving around now,
trying to find him.

46:00.844 --> 46:02.304
Is he okay?
Do you have any leads?

46:02.387 --> 46:04.723
No, I don't, but I can tell you
he's definitely a person of interest

46:04.806 --> 46:05.933
regarding this assault.

46:06.016 --> 46:07.017
That's ridiculous.

46:07.100 --> 46:09.144
[Hardaway]
<i>Well, the fact of the matter is, ma'am,</i>

46:09.228 --> 46:10.270

46:10.354 --> 46:12.523
And your husband was the only
other person there.

46:12.606 --> 46:14.525
Dom's not a killer.
He's the one that's in trouble.

46:14.608 --> 46:15.943
You should be looking for him.

46:16.026 --> 46:19.780
Okay. Well, ma'am, if you hear from him,
I need you to contact me immediately.

46:20.572 --> 46:22.324
Thank you.
You have a nice day.

[Dom] Damn, you're fine.

46:40.217 --> 46:41.301
[Lexi] I am?

46:41.385 --> 46:42.219
Yeah.

46:42.302 --> 46:43.387
You really think so?

46:43.971 --> 46:45.639
Yeah.
All this time, I've been trying to...

46:45.722 --> 46:47.933
trying to get from
being locked down here, and...

46:48.976 --> 46:50.519
everything I need is right here.

46:51.979 --> 46:53.146
It is?

46:53.730 --> 46:54.565
[Dom] Of course.

46:55.899 --> 46:58.819
I mean, I've just been in a lot of pain.

46:58.902 --> 47:02.865
My arm feels like it's broken,
and probably my ribs or somethin'.

47:02.948 --> 47:06.201
Baby, I've been trying to put your arm
into a sling, but you won't let me.

47:06.827 --> 47:09.121
I need some pain medicine.
It'll help me to relax.

-Really?
-Yeah. Anything, yo.

Okay.

Wait. What is that?

Don't worry.
It feels good.

[clears throat]

47:32.936 --> 47:34.188
So...

47:39.234 --> 47:40.360
do you remember me?

47:41.778 --> 47:43.322
How could I forget?

47:45.324 --> 47:47.159
I mean, that night was magical, right?

47:48.076 --> 47:48.911
Yeah.

47:48.994 --> 47:51.038
[Lexi]
And then you wrote that song about me.

47:51.747 --> 47:53.248
That's how I knew this was real.

47:55.375 --> 47:57.211
There's a lot more songs to be written.

47:57.711 --> 47:59.796
Just let me out of the chair, baby.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.048
I called you, Dom.

48:01.131 --> 48:02.424
I called you so many times.

48:02.508 --> 48:06.094
I mean, look,
my phone number changes all the time.

48:06.178 --> 48:07.471
I called Quan, too.

48:07.554 --> 48:08.430
[Dom] Quan?

48:09.264 --> 48:11.308
He took me home that night.
You remember that?

48:11.391 --> 48:13.685
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

48:13.769 --> 48:15.062
So, um...

What do you remember the most?

48:21.652 --> 48:22.945
Come on, sillyhead.

I want details.

you know?

[Lexi giggles]

48:34.164 --> 48:35.290
What was I wearing?

48:35.791 --> 48:39.545
I don't really remember,
it was so long ago, you know?

48:39.628 --> 48:41.004
I'm just like... [scoffs]

48:41.088 --> 48:43.632
-You don't remember, do you?
-No. No, I, I do.

You're lying.

48:44.633 --> 48:46.134
-I do.
-Liar!

No, really. I, I, I remember.

I do. I do.
I remember.

No, listen. I remember.
Wait. Look. Listen.

I, I do. I remember.
Trust me. I remember. I remember.

49:03.193 --> 49:05.112
[suspenseful music]

49:05.195 --> 49:08.031
You're the type that like
to tatt your women up, too, right?

49:08.115 --> 49:08.991
No, I'm not into that.

49:09.074 --> 49:11.285
No?
Let's see how you like this shit.

49:11.368 --> 49:14.788
No. Listen-- No! No!

Okay.

-Hey.

49:37.352 --> 49:38.604
I was hoping it was Dom.

49:38.687 --> 49:39.813
Yeah, about that.

49:40.564 --> 49:41.773
Yo, Zo, what's going on?

49:41.857 --> 49:43.567
I thought you said you'd keep me posted.

49:43.650 --> 49:46.278

-</i>So you haven't heard from Dom?

49:46.361 --> 49:48.655
No. I mean, I would call you if I had.

What's going on?

[Quan] <i>Yo, I got a text from him
saying everything was cool.</i>

[Quan] <i>Yeah.
He said he needed to go out west</i>

49:59.333 --> 50:00.584

50:06.965 --> 50:10.302
I've been calling and texting him all day.
He sent <i>you</i> a text?

50:11.470 --> 50:13.222
Yeah, he tweetin' and everything.

50:14.431 --> 50:15.682
Yo, you sure y'all cool?

50:15.766 --> 50:17.601
No, this isn't makin' sense.

50:19.645 --> 50:20.854
I know he wouldn't leave me.

50:21.355 --> 50:22.648
It sounds like he did.

50:23.148 --> 50:25.400
<i>Maybe we should just leave
and meet him in L.A.</i>

50:25.484 --> 50:27.402
<i>-Work it out out there.</i>
-No. No. Where are you?

50:27.486 --> 50:28.737
I'm on my way to the airport.

50:28.820 --> 50:30.531
[Zoe] <i>Yo, Quan, you know Dom.</i>

50:31.615 --> 50:33.825
Would he really leave me?
Here?

50:35.786 --> 50:37.913
Nah. Nah, he wouldn't.

50:38.497 --> 50:40.499
People get their phones hacked
all the time,

50:40.582 --> 50:41.708
even their social media.

50:41.792 --> 50:43.252
Maybe somebody got his phone.

50:44.378 --> 50:46.922
We're gonna have to figure this out,
'cause something's going on,

50:47.005 --> 50:47.881
and I need your help.

50:47.965 --> 50:49.091
All right. Bet.

50:50.259 --> 50:51.426
I'm turning around right now.

51:01.937 --> 51:03.272
[Zoe] What the hell?

51:13.031 --> 51:15.033
[cellphone rings]

51:16.034 --> 51:16.869
Hello?

51:16.952 --> 51:20.998
[Tim] Hey. I'm sending you a packet
with everything I have on Alexis Carrigan.

51:21.081 --> 51:22.499
Tell me you got something.

51:22.583 --> 51:23.625
[Tim] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

51:23.709 --> 51:26.545
This is a very disturbed young woman.

51:26.628 --> 51:27.588
You got an address?

51:27.671 --> 51:28.714
-Yep.
<i>-Thanks, Tim.</i>

51:28.797 --> 51:30.090
Thank you so much. I owe you.

51:30.174 --> 51:31.216
All right.

51:36.096 --> 51:37.931
[crow cawing]

51:39.766 --> 51:44.021
[suspenseful music]

51:44.730 --> 51:45.856
Baby?

51:49.359 --> 51:50.527
[sighs]

51:50.611 --> 51:52.487
God, you look like you're in so much pain.

51:53.947 --> 51:55.532
I hate seeing you like this.

51:56.074 --> 51:57.242
Don't touch me.

51:57.326 --> 51:58.493
[groans]

51:58.577 --> 52:01.705
You can't keep me down here forever.
People are gonna be looking for me.

52:02.414 --> 52:04.833
How is it that you never say
the right thing?

52:04.917 --> 52:07.127
Hmm?
I just don't get it, Dom.

52:07.211 --> 52:09.171
You have a poet's soul...

52:10.506 --> 52:12.424
with an asshole tongue, hmm?

52:13.634 --> 52:17.804
And, FYI, I can keep you down here
for as long as I want.

52:18.555 --> 52:19.681
[sighs]

52:19.765 --> 52:21.683
It's gonna be cold tonight.

52:26.605 --> 52:31.735
Let's make sure that we use the blanket
so that you can stay warm.

52:33.362 --> 52:35.656
Yo, you are batshit crazy, chick.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.574
What do you want from me, huh?

52:40.911 --> 52:42.454
Dom, baby,
when are you gonna get it?

52:42.538 --> 52:44.456
I want a family with you.

52:44.540 --> 52:46.041
I want to spend my life with you.

52:46.124 --> 52:47.960
I want to wake up next to you
every morning.

52:48.752 --> 52:51.046
I want to share your days with you.

52:51.129 --> 52:53.590
I want to laugh with you.
I want to fight.

52:54.466 --> 52:57.261
Well, fighting. We kind of got that
down pat, don't we?

52:57.344 --> 52:59.638
[chuckles]
Dom, I'm doing my part.

52:59.721 --> 53:01.014
It's time you do yours, okay?

53:02.057 --> 53:03.475
I have a beautiful wife...

53:04.393 --> 53:07.813
that I wake up next to
every single morning who loves me,

53:08.313 --> 53:09.690
and I love her.

53:09.773 --> 53:11.066
And that'll never be you.

53:11.149 --> 53:12.192
<i>I</i> love you!

53:12.901 --> 53:14.736
She doesn't love you like I love you, Dom.

53:16.405 --> 53:18.115
[suspenseful music]

53:18.198 --> 53:19.283
You know what?

53:20.492 --> 53:22.119
I have something for that bitch.

53:22.744 --> 53:24.288
Don't you touch my wife!

53:24.371 --> 53:27.541
For the last time,
she's not your wife. <i>I am!</i>

53:28.709 --> 53:32.754
[suspenseful music]

53:37.926 --> 53:39.469
[chains rattling]

53:42.222 --> 53:43.557
[doorbell rings]

53:44.892 --> 53:47.311
[clock ticking]

53:55.110 --> 53:57.154
[bullets clinking, rattling]

54:16.340 --> 54:17.466
[knock on door]

54:27.893 --> 54:30.103
Hi. I'm Zoe Driver from <i>The Star</i>.

54:30.646 --> 54:32.481
-Can we talk?
<i>-The Star?</i>

54:33.815 --> 54:34.650
What about?

54:34.733 --> 54:38.779
Hold up. I remember you.
You're the nurse from the hospital, right?

54:40.364 --> 54:42.157
[clears throat]
Yeah, how can I help you?

54:42.241 --> 54:43.992
I'm following up on a missing person.

54:44.826 --> 54:46.370
-Okay.
-My husband...

54:46.995 --> 54:47.913
Dom D...

54:48.622 --> 54:49.706
the rapper.

54:49.790 --> 54:50.832
You're familiar.

54:50.916 --> 54:51.750
Right?

54:52.626 --> 54:54.628
[chuckles]

54:55.295 --> 54:56.129
Uh-huh.

54:57.130 --> 54:59.007
You're not at all what I pictured.

54:59.758 --> 55:02.219
I mean,
I pictured a strong, brassy woman,

55:02.886 --> 55:05.722
not some insecure, jealous girlfriend
hunting down her man.

55:06.223 --> 55:08.892
Okay. To put your mind at ease,
Dom's not here.

55:08.976 --> 55:10.394
He was, but he's gone now.

55:10.477 --> 55:12.479
Something about going back to Los Angeles.

55:13.021 --> 55:14.648
[sighs] In case you were wondering...

55:15.232 --> 55:17.860
yes, he made love to me.

55:20.696 --> 55:21.822
Right.

55:21.905 --> 55:23.031
You look mad.

55:24.116 --> 55:26.952
Wait, you want to fight me, Zoe?

55:27.619 --> 55:30.581
I mean, I would just think it would
be beneath two intelligent women

55:30.664 --> 55:31.957
to sit out here and fight.

55:32.040 --> 55:33.834
Alexis, right?
That's your name?

55:33.917 --> 55:35.961
You know my name.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

55:36.044 --> 55:38.422
Well, listen, I don't know what game
you're playing right now,

55:38.505 --> 55:39.590
but playtime is up.

55:39.673 --> 55:42.050
Oh, no, sweetheart.
It's just getting started.

55:42.801 --> 55:44.469
See, I know what Dom is.

55:45.095 --> 55:46.054
He's a man.

55:47.097 --> 55:50.100
And I've forgiven him
for all of his indiscretions.

55:50.976 --> 55:52.311
So he's home now,

55:52.394 --> 55:53.937
-and we're good.
-He's here?

55:54.938 --> 55:56.648
-What?
-Move.

55:57.357 --> 55:59.234
-[Lexi] Have you lost your damn mind?
-Dom!

55:59.318 --> 56:01.028
-Get out of my house!
-Dom!

56:02.070 --> 56:03.447
[suspenseful music]

56:03.530 --> 56:05.490
[Zoe] Where is he? Dom!

56:08.368 --> 56:09.453
Dom!

56:10.454 --> 56:14.499
[suspenseful music]

56:20.380 --> 56:21.715
Where is he?

56:22.299 --> 56:23.509
I already told you.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.428
We had a little fun, and then he left.

56:26.512 --> 56:28.138
And now it's time for you to leave!

56:28.222 --> 56:29.223
Just relax.

56:30.057 --> 56:31.683
I just want to know, where is Dom?

56:31.767 --> 56:33.852
Get out of my house
or I'm calling the police!

56:34.895 --> 56:38.524
[dramatic music]

56:39.608 --> 56:41.068
So call them.

56:41.860 --> 56:45.614
[dramatic music]

56:47.366 --> 56:48.534
I know you're lying.

56:49.910 --> 56:51.745
And I know you know where he is.

56:51.828 --> 56:52.955
Get out!

56:54.373 --> 56:58.210
[dramatic music]

57:06.677 --> 57:09.555
[mysterious music]

57:10.430 --> 57:11.890
[cellphone chimes]

57:13.809 --> 57:16.395
[mysterious music]

57:16.979 --> 57:18.313
She's not even that pretty.

57:31.910 --> 57:33.036
[Lexi] Dom, baby?

57:35.956 --> 57:36.915
Don't be mad.

57:39.626 --> 57:40.502
Please...

57:43.755 --> 57:44.965
Please let me go.

57:48.677 --> 57:50.554
I won't tell anybody who you are.

57:51.388 --> 57:53.932
-Or what you did. Please.
-[Lexi laughs]

57:54.016 --> 57:55.267
Who I am?

57:55.851 --> 57:57.686
But you don't remember me, right?

57:58.812 --> 58:00.022
You just used me.

58:01.064 --> 58:03.775
You just left me on the curb
like yesterday's trash.

58:04.860 --> 58:06.153
You stained my soul, Dom.

58:07.029 --> 58:08.030
And then, poof.

58:09.114 --> 58:11.450
You just disappeared
just as fast as you came.

58:16.997 --> 58:18.123
Look, um...

58:20.792 --> 58:21.835
I realize...

58:22.836 --> 58:24.588
what I did-- I hurt you.

58:27.466 --> 58:28.884
I'm really sorry about that.

58:29.426 --> 58:30.552
[groans]

58:33.430 --> 58:34.431
That's fine.

58:36.433 --> 58:38.477
All I want is for us to be a family.

58:39.478 --> 58:41.104
We're going to be a family.

58:42.773 --> 58:43.982
I'm gonna have your baby.

58:44.066 --> 58:47.069
[dramatic music]

58:48.028 --> 58:50.572
One last time, I promise.

58:52.991 --> 58:56.745
[dramatic music]

59:04.503 --> 59:05.963
[horns honking]

59:06.463 --> 59:07.840
[siren wailing in distance]

59:14.596 --> 59:15.722
[Zoe] Sheriff Hardaway?

59:17.140 --> 59:17.975
Yeah.

59:19.434 --> 59:20.686
I need to talk to you.

59:21.395 --> 59:22.271
[Zoe] About what?

59:23.355 --> 59:24.231
Um...

59:24.857 --> 59:26.191
do you want to talk inside?

59:40.372 --> 59:41.582
[Hardaway sighs]

59:43.834 --> 59:46.670
Alright, we got a call
about a disturbance.

59:46.753 --> 59:47.880
[Zoe scoffs]

59:47.963 --> 59:49.464
She called the police on me?

59:49.548 --> 59:50.674
She was pretty upset.

59:51.592 --> 59:54.052
She said that you threatened her,
broke into her home,

59:54.136 --> 59:55.596
and vandalized her things.

59:55.679 --> 59:56.972
I can't believe this.

59:57.055 --> 1:00:00.058
Now, I understand
that this has been pretty tough on you.

1:00:00.142 --> 1:00:01.226
Do you?

1:00:01.310 --> 1:00:02.769
Yeah, but what I don't understand

1:00:02.853 --> 1:00:05.272
is why would you be harassing
Mrs. Carrigan?

1:00:05.355 --> 1:00:07.357
What does she have to do with any of this?

1:00:07.441 --> 1:00:09.526
She was at the club
the night Dom disappeared.

1:00:09.610 --> 1:00:11.403
Okay. Well, so were a lot of women.

1:00:11.945 --> 1:00:14.990
[scoffs] She assaulted a woman
in the bathroom.

1:00:15.073 --> 1:00:16.116
She's clearly unstable.

1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:18.368
Do you know she was in a mental institute?

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:20.204
Well, that was a long time ago.

1:00:20.287 --> 1:00:22.206
This is a good Christian woman
we're talking about.

1:00:22.289 --> 1:00:24.166
-She's a nurse, isn't she?
-What does that even mean?

1:00:24.249 --> 1:00:25.626
What does any of this mean?

1:00:25.709 --> 1:00:27.753
It's all speculation.

1:00:27.836 --> 1:00:30.547
Well, I found his shirt in her bedroom.
How you gonna explain that?

1:00:30.631 --> 1:00:32.799
-Was he there when you found it?
-No, but--

1:00:32.883 --> 1:00:34.968
Then what makes you think
he's being held against his will?

1:00:35.052 --> 1:00:36.678
Because that's my husband,
and I know.

1:00:36.762 --> 1:00:39.681
All right, look, I had some
of my guys at the station look into this,

1:00:39.765 --> 1:00:42.476
and based on their professional research,
he's back in L.A.

1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:44.144
I don't believe that.

1:00:44.853 --> 1:00:48.273
The question is, why would he leave
when his friend is still in the hospital,

1:00:48.357 --> 1:00:49.191
laid up in a coma?

1:00:49.274 --> 1:00:50.567
Because he didn't leave.

1:00:51.443 --> 1:00:52.986
She knows more than what she's saying.

1:00:53.070 --> 1:00:54.905
So we could just get out of here
and stop talking--

1:00:54.988 --> 1:00:56.114
No, we can't get out of here.

1:00:56.198 --> 1:00:58.575
We're not going anywhere!
Now, you're lucky I don't arrest you.

1:00:59.284 --> 1:01:01.537
You need to get on a plane tonight...

1:01:02.037 --> 1:01:02.871
and go home.

1:01:02.955 --> 1:01:06.124
I'm not going anywhere
until I find my husband.

1:01:06.208 --> 1:01:08.669
I'm telling you this for your own good.

1:01:09.253 --> 1:01:11.338
Now, that poor woman
has been through enough.

1:01:11.421 --> 1:01:13.674
If I decide to move forward
with this complaint,

1:01:13.757 --> 1:01:15.926
it's gonna be all bad for you, lady.

1:01:16.552 --> 1:01:17.386
You done?

1:01:17.469 --> 1:01:19.471
No, I'm not done, Mrs. Driver!

1:01:20.055 --> 1:01:22.891
I'm urging you to stay away
from the Carrigan house.

1:01:23.392 --> 1:01:24.935
Get on a plane.

1:01:25.018 --> 1:01:27.229
Go home tonight.

1:01:28.772 --> 1:01:29.857
Now, safe travels.

1:01:30.691 --> 1:01:31.942
Have a good evening.

1:01:32.901 --> 1:01:35.487
[intense music]

1:01:45.831 --> 1:01:47.875
[cellphone ringing]

1:01:48.375 --> 1:01:49.209
Hello?

1:01:49.293 --> 1:01:50.294
[Tim] <i>Hey.</i>

1:01:50.377 --> 1:01:51.962
Did you look at the packet yet?

1:01:52.588 --> 1:01:54.631
No. There's just a lot going
on here right now.

1:01:54.715 --> 1:01:56.425
-What's up?
-[Tim] <i>Well, you need to look at it.</i>

1:01:56.508 --> 1:01:59.303
You know she was institutionalized
after her father died?

1:01:59.386 --> 1:02:00.637
Yeah.

1:02:00.721 --> 1:02:02.598
That's not the only reason
she was put in there.

1:02:03.932 --> 1:02:04.808
What happened?

1:02:05.434 --> 1:02:06.560
Some real bad shit.

1:02:06.643 --> 1:02:07.769
Timothy.

1:02:08.437 --> 1:02:10.063
[sighs]

1:02:10.939 --> 1:02:14.151
[Tim] <i>Her father died,
a stroke in his living room.</i>

1:02:15.027 --> 1:02:17.946
[somber music]

1:02:19.656 --> 1:02:23.452
<i>It was called in by a mailman
who noticed Carrigan through the window.</i>

1:02:24.453 --> 1:02:29.124
[somber music]

1:02:31.418 --> 1:02:33.420
Okay, so her father died.

1:02:33.504 --> 1:02:34.463
Yes, we know.

1:02:36.006 --> 1:02:39.468
[somber music]

1:02:44.348 --> 1:02:45.849
[Tim] <i>Well, when the police arrived,</i>

1:02:45.933 --> 1:02:48.352
<i>Mr. Carrigan was slumped over
in his wheelchair.</i>

1:02:52.272 --> 1:02:53.524
What have we got?

1:02:53.607 --> 1:02:54.858
Better call it in.

1:02:54.942 --> 1:02:56.693
When the police searched the house,

1:02:57.236 --> 1:02:59.863
they found Alexis on the floor
in a pool of blood.

1:03:00.948 --> 1:03:04.952
<i>Apparently, she was pregnant,
but hid it from her father.</i>

1:03:05.035 --> 1:03:06.370
[breathing heavily]

1:03:06.453 --> 1:03:08.789
<i>I guess the strain
of finding her father dead</i>

1:03:09.540 --> 1:03:11.124
<i>led to her miscarriage.</i>

1:03:12.167 --> 1:03:15.420
[somber music]

1:03:16.964 --> 1:03:17.965
[officer] You all right?

1:03:18.048 --> 1:03:19.049
Joe!

1:03:19.967 --> 1:03:21.093
[Lexi crying]

1:03:21.176 --> 1:03:22.511
[officer]
Joe, call 911.

1:03:26.932 --> 1:03:28.892
-All right. I got it.
-Well, there's more.

1:03:28.976 --> 1:03:31.979
[Tim] <i>The reason she hadn't told
her father about the baby...</i>

1:03:32.062 --> 1:03:34.356
[Lexi] What are you doing?

1:03:34.439 --> 1:03:36.108
[crying] Why are you doing this?

1:03:36.191 --> 1:03:37.526
[Tim] <i>...was because, uh...</i>

1:03:37.609 --> 1:03:39.736
[Lexi] Why are you doing this?
Please, don't do this.

1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:40.946
No, no, please don't--

1:03:41.029 --> 1:03:42.614
Please, don't do this! Please!

1:03:42.698 --> 1:03:46.702
[Tim] <i>...she was brutally gang-raped,
on prom night, no less.</i>

1:03:46.785 --> 1:03:49.788
[Lexi] No, please don't, leave me!
Please don't, leave me! Please, please!

1:03:49.872 --> 1:03:53.000
Why are you doing this?
Please don't!

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.920
Okay. Well, did they find out who did it?

1:03:57.004 --> 1:03:58.297
No.

1:03:58.380 --> 1:03:59.965
She wouldn't even make a statement.

1:04:00.674 --> 1:04:02.134
After her father died,

1:04:02.217 --> 1:04:04.803
a video surfaced of the rape
on the dark web,

1:04:04.887 --> 1:04:07.181
but the police never identified
the assailants

1:04:07.264 --> 1:04:09.057
or where the video came from.

1:04:09.558 --> 1:04:11.435
How could that never have come out?

1:04:11.518 --> 1:04:13.854
Oh, it did, but it was buried.

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:16.023
She was a minor at the time.

1:04:16.648 --> 1:04:19.526
They put her in a foster home
until she turned 18.

1:04:19.610 --> 1:04:24.031
Her foster parents tried to make
her stay as normal as possible, I guess.

1:04:24.114 --> 1:04:27.659
<i>Also, there's a picture of her father
in the wheelchair</i>

1:04:27.743 --> 1:04:30.162
<i>in the front room of the house.</i>

1:04:30.245 --> 1:04:31.330
Mm. Yeah, yeah.

1:04:31.413 --> 1:04:34.458
I know this room.
I saw it, but I didn't check it.

1:04:34.541 --> 1:04:35.876
[Tim] <i>Oh, hey, one more thing,</i>

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:40.589
<i>and don't ask me how I got this,
but she's been hospitalized many times.</i>

1:04:42.174 --> 1:04:43.008
For what?

1:04:43.842 --> 1:04:47.179
[Tim] <i>By the looks of the medicine
used to treat her, miscarriages.</i>

1:04:48.597 --> 1:04:49.890
I gotta go. Thank you.

1:04:49.973 --> 1:04:51.225
[Tim] <i>All right.</i>

1:04:51.934 --> 1:04:53.727
[dialing]

1:04:55.103 --> 1:04:56.813
Hey.
I think I know where Dom is.

1:04:56.897 --> 1:04:58.357
I'm about to text you the address.

1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:01.693
[water rushing]

1:05:09.910 --> 1:05:11.995
It's actually beautiful
if you think about it...

1:05:12.829 --> 1:05:13.830
baptism.

1:05:15.749 --> 1:05:17.960
It doesn't just cleanse your soul
and your body.

1:05:18.836 --> 1:05:20.087
It cleanses your mind.

1:05:23.257 --> 1:05:24.466
But it's not your fault, Dom.

1:05:25.551 --> 1:05:27.302
We were all born to sin.

1:05:28.595 --> 1:05:30.305
Your sin just caught up to you.

1:05:53.161 --> 1:05:54.913
Come on, Quan. Only one?

1:05:56.456 --> 1:05:57.541
[sighs]

1:06:04.006 --> 1:06:05.757
[crow cawing]

1:06:08.468 --> 1:06:11.722
[door creaking]

1:06:17.686 --> 1:06:20.272
[door creaks and closes]

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:27.279
Alexis?

1:06:35.287 --> 1:06:36.121
Dom?

1:06:49.885 --> 1:06:50.886
Alexis?

1:07:00.771 --> 1:07:01.813
[thud]

1:07:03.398 --> 1:07:05.025
[Dom groans]

1:07:06.318 --> 1:07:08.862
This is really a lot harder for me
than it looks, Dom.

1:07:10.405 --> 1:07:12.658
I really wish
that we had more time together.

1:07:14.368 --> 1:07:15.369
You know...

1:07:16.203 --> 1:07:18.205
many great loves end before their prime.

1:07:18.288 --> 1:07:20.207
Romeo and Juliet.

1:07:20.832 --> 1:07:24.086
Tristan and Isolde.
Paolo and Francesca.

1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:26.004
Bonnie and Clyde.

1:07:26.088 --> 1:07:28.131
Listen... please...

1:07:29.424 --> 1:07:33.303
whatever I did to hurt you,
however I hurt you,

1:07:33.387 --> 1:07:36.223
I am, I'm so sorry.

1:07:37.975 --> 1:07:40.477
You have to hear me, okay?
Listen, I was a...

1:07:40.561 --> 1:07:42.521
I was a different man back then.

1:07:42.604 --> 1:07:44.731
Okay? I'm sorry.

1:07:44.815 --> 1:07:45.858
People don't change, Dom.

1:07:45.941 --> 1:07:47.442
And you know that I know that.

1:07:47.526 --> 1:07:49.903
I've given you chances,
but it doesn't even matter.

1:07:49.987 --> 1:07:53.448
I can change, I promise you.
Please, give me another chance.

1:07:53.991 --> 1:07:56.368
Let me show you, please.

1:07:56.451 --> 1:07:57.786
I can change.

1:07:57.870 --> 1:08:00.414
Let me go, please. Please.

1:08:02.958 --> 1:08:05.002
I really wish I could believe you.

1:08:05.085 --> 1:08:07.129
-[Dom sighs]
-I really do.

1:08:07.963 --> 1:08:10.340
My daddy warned me
about men like you, Dom.

1:08:12.467 --> 1:08:13.927
But I never listened.

1:08:14.428 --> 1:08:15.679
[giggles]

1:08:16.513 --> 1:08:19.850
Man, I was just always attracted
to the glitz and the fame.

1:08:20.559 --> 1:08:22.686
Captain of the football team,

1:08:23.478 --> 1:08:26.648
famous rappers and actors.
I didn't listen. I was rebellious.

1:08:28.567 --> 1:08:29.860
And then, when he died...

1:08:30.986 --> 1:08:32.696
I got a new family.

1:08:34.615 --> 1:08:36.575
And they were supposed to love me,

1:08:36.658 --> 1:08:39.286
and protect me like he did,
but they didn't.

1:08:40.037 --> 1:08:41.038
I'm sorry.

1:08:41.121 --> 1:08:42.122
[sighs]

1:08:42.623 --> 1:08:44.333
Please, let me go.
Please.

1:08:44.416 --> 1:08:47.878
When I have our child,
you won't have a thing to worry about,

1:08:47.961 --> 1:08:50.756
'cause I'll protect him,
and I'll make you so proud of me.

1:08:50.839 --> 1:08:54.092
I'm sorry, I know somebody hurt you,
and I understand.

1:08:54.176 --> 1:08:55.969
You don't understand shit, Dom!

1:09:01.141 --> 1:09:04.478
[mysterious music]

1:09:49.064 --> 1:09:52.943
[dramatic music]

1:10:09.251 --> 1:10:15.674
[music continues]

1:10:25.434 --> 1:10:27.186
[Lexi on recording] <i>What are you doing?</i>

1:10:27.269 --> 1:10:29.021
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1:10:29.688 --> 1:10:30.856
<i>What is this?</i>

1:10:35.527 --> 1:10:37.863
<i>Please don't do-- Wait!
Please don't do this.</i>

1:10:40.908 --> 1:10:42.075
You know...

1:10:42.159 --> 1:10:44.745
I was thinking
about giving you this little cocktail

1:10:44.828 --> 1:10:46.955
to help you sleep through your baptism.

1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:57.174
Then I decided I wanted you
to experience the fullness of it.

1:11:00.511 --> 1:11:01.386
So this...

1:11:02.888 --> 1:11:05.724
will help you from squirming too much.

1:11:05.807 --> 1:11:06.850
Please don't.

1:11:06.934 --> 1:11:08.602
[groans]

1:11:11.647 --> 1:11:12.898
[Lexi clears throat]

1:11:14.149 --> 1:11:15.067
Please.

1:11:16.151 --> 1:11:18.195
This is gonna be so beautiful.

1:11:18.278 --> 1:11:20.822
And then you can watch over us
from Heaven.

1:11:24.326 --> 1:11:26.411
No, you don't have to do this, please.

1:11:26.495 --> 1:11:27.621
It's okay.

1:11:29.164 --> 1:11:31.166
[foreboding music]

1:11:31.875 --> 1:11:32.918
[Dom] Please.

1:11:34.878 --> 1:11:37.548
[foreboding music]

1:11:38.632 --> 1:11:43.428
[chains rattling]

1:11:46.431 --> 1:11:50.394
[foreboding music]

1:11:55.816 --> 1:11:57.526
[Dom groans]

1:12:02.072 --> 1:12:04.825
[water gurgling]

1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:10.080
[Dom groans]

1:12:11.665 --> 1:12:14.710
[ominous music]

1:12:19.339 --> 1:12:20.215
Miss Driver.

1:12:24.344 --> 1:12:26.180
I thought I told you to stay away.

1:12:27.973 --> 1:12:30.350
What are you doing here? Huh?

1:12:30.434 --> 1:12:33.270
I would ask you the same thing,
but we both know why you're here.

1:12:33.353 --> 1:12:35.814
Well, see, the difference between...

1:12:36.982 --> 1:12:38.108
me and you is...

1:12:38.609 --> 1:12:40.110
you're trespassing.

1:12:40.194 --> 1:12:41.778
And that's against the law.

1:12:42.696 --> 1:12:43.947
You know that, right?

1:12:46.533 --> 1:12:47.951
You shouldn't be watching this.

1:12:48.994 --> 1:12:49.995
You shouldn't be here!

1:12:50.078 --> 1:12:52.789
I don't know what twisted shit
y'all got going on right now....

1:12:52.873 --> 1:12:56.168
It's real easy to judge
what you don't understand, isn't it?

1:12:56.877 --> 1:12:57.753
Huh?

1:12:58.378 --> 1:12:59.338
Move your hand.

1:13:00.088 --> 1:13:01.215
Let me see your hands.

1:13:02.257 --> 1:13:03.467
[chuckles] And...

1:13:03.550 --> 1:13:06.053
And to think, I tried to help you!

1:13:06.136 --> 1:13:08.514
I, I-- I gave you an out.

1:13:08.597 --> 1:13:10.057
[laughs]

1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.850
You could have got away.

1:13:12.601 --> 1:13:16.980
But you still brought
your black ass right back here, huh?

1:13:17.064 --> 1:13:18.565
[chuckles]

1:13:19.399 --> 1:13:21.735
You damn reporters.

1:13:23.278 --> 1:13:24.154
[laughs]

1:13:27.658 --> 1:13:28.534
Are you...?

1:13:30.244 --> 1:13:32.746
Turn that off.
Turn it off now!

1:13:35.290 --> 1:13:37.042
Hands. Now.

1:13:37.918 --> 1:13:39.545
That was a long time ago.

1:13:40.546 --> 1:13:41.964
I made a mistake.

1:13:43.006 --> 1:13:44.633
I didn't want to do that.

1:13:46.218 --> 1:13:47.761
It doesn't look like that to me.

1:13:47.845 --> 1:13:50.055
I don't give a good
God damn what you think.

1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:54.184
I hate myself for what I did to her.

1:13:55.269 --> 1:13:57.646
I loved Lexi.

1:13:58.272 --> 1:14:00.691
I loved her then.
I love her now.

1:14:00.774 --> 1:14:01.817
[Zoe] Right.

1:14:02.401 --> 1:14:05.988
Which is why you kill for her, and abduct?

1:14:06.071 --> 1:14:09.032
[Hardaway] Don't try to act
like you understand me.

1:14:09.116 --> 1:14:10.284
You don't know me!

1:14:10.826 --> 1:14:14.371
Whatever it takes to make up
for the hell that I put her through.

1:14:14.955 --> 1:14:17.875
-You love her.
-Yes. I love her.

1:14:17.958 --> 1:14:20.294
[Hardaway] I will do anything.
I love her, but--

1:14:20.878 --> 1:14:22.462
but she don't love me back.

1:14:22.546 --> 1:14:24.131
-And it's okay.
-It's okay.

1:14:24.214 --> 1:14:27.092
That's why I keep trying to prove to her--

1:14:27.176 --> 1:14:28.302
Nah. Now-- now, see,

1:14:28.385 --> 1:14:31.054
I'm gonna need you to take that gun
and put it on the floor.

1:14:32.014 --> 1:14:32.973
Put it on the floor!

1:14:33.557 --> 1:14:34.516
Easy.

1:14:35.142 --> 1:14:36.226
I will shoot you.

1:14:39.771 --> 1:14:40.689
Kick it over.

1:14:42.357 --> 1:14:44.860
Thank you. Yeah.

1:14:44.943 --> 1:14:46.612
Listen, please just let me go.

1:14:46.695 --> 1:14:47.696
[Hardaway] Heh.

1:14:47.779 --> 1:14:49.531
I won't say anything to the press.

1:14:49.615 --> 1:14:50.824
I'm just trying to find Dom.

1:14:51.617 --> 1:14:52.826
That was good.

1:14:52.910 --> 1:14:54.077
That was real good.

1:14:54.161 --> 1:14:55.204
I mean, I-- [chuckles]

1:14:55.287 --> 1:14:56.538
I mean, I, I felt it.

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:59.833
Did you-- you obviously-- you...

1:15:00.584 --> 1:15:01.793
You meant that, maybe, huh?

1:15:01.877 --> 1:15:04.379
Right? [chuckles]
I mean, I really wish I could.

1:15:05.047 --> 1:15:06.632
But it's way too late for that.

1:15:06.715 --> 1:15:07.674
Please.

1:15:07.758 --> 1:15:10.219
[Hardaway ] I mean, come on, now.
This is just way too juicy,

1:15:10.302 --> 1:15:12.346
anyway, for you to forget about.

1:15:12.429 --> 1:15:15.557
You know you want to put this all up
on Facebook and Instagram.

1:15:15.641 --> 1:15:18.060
You gonna-- huh?
Can't forget about your little blog.

1:15:18.143 --> 1:15:19.394
No, I don't.

1:15:19.478 --> 1:15:22.189
You know, she would have never known
it was me.

1:15:22.272 --> 1:15:23.649
She would have never known.

1:15:23.732 --> 1:15:25.901
And her prom date
is the one who set it up.

1:15:26.944 --> 1:15:27.861
It was him.

1:15:28.570 --> 1:15:30.906
She was so innocent, so trusting.

1:15:32.616 --> 1:15:34.368
I had to confess to her.

1:15:35.202 --> 1:15:36.537
I confessed to her.

1:15:37.579 --> 1:15:38.580
On my own!

1:15:38.664 --> 1:15:40.457
I really don't care about any of this.

1:15:40.541 --> 1:15:42.376
Can you just let me go?
Please?

1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:44.086
[Hardaway] Oh.

1:15:44.169 --> 1:15:46.380

1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:51.468

award-winning journalist like you.

1:15:51.552 --> 1:15:53.178
So what? You just gonna kill me now?

1:15:53.262 --> 1:15:54.805
Oh, no.

1:15:55.681 --> 1:15:56.515
Me?

1:15:57.599 --> 1:15:59.768

1:16:00.769 --> 1:16:01.603
No.

1:16:02.688 --> 1:16:03.897
I ain't gonna kill you.

1:16:04.606 --> 1:16:05.816
Lexi's gonna do that.

1:16:05.899 --> 1:16:08.360
I mean, look at what you did.
Let me break it down for you.

1:16:08.443 --> 1:16:13.115
You-- you harassed this poor woman,
you broke into her home,

1:16:13.615 --> 1:16:15.158
I mean, it's understandable,

1:16:15.242 --> 1:16:18.412
especially after you guys
shared the same lover, right?

1:16:19.079 --> 1:16:21.874
Me, I'm--
I'm just gonna do the paperwork.

1:16:21.957 --> 1:16:23.000
And what about Dom?

1:16:23.584 --> 1:16:25.002
What about Dom?

1:16:26.795 --> 1:16:29.548
What is it with you ladies and this Dom?

1:16:29.631 --> 1:16:30.465
God!

1:16:32.759 --> 1:16:36.054
Well, sweetie, you don't ever have
to worry about Dom again.

1:16:36.138 --> 1:16:38.182
'Cause ain't nobody ever gonna find him.

1:16:38.265 --> 1:16:39.308
Heh.

1:16:45.689 --> 1:16:47.024
What you thinking now, huh?

1:16:47.733 --> 1:16:49.860
You thinking how can you get away?

1:16:50.569 --> 1:16:52.321
Make a run, break for it?

1:16:52.863 --> 1:16:56.200
You gonna hit me with one of these lamps
like they do in the movies, right?

1:16:56.283 --> 1:16:58.160
Huh? Yeah.

1:17:00.329 --> 1:17:01.580
For so many...

1:17:02.247 --> 1:17:03.874
it's what you all think about.

1:17:04.791 --> 1:17:05.876

of you raping Alexis all on my phone.

What, do I look like
I'm stupid to you, huh?

1:17:24.269 --> 1:17:27.356
You know, and I was wondering why
you wouldn't help me find Dom.

1:17:28.273 --> 1:17:31.401
All those times you were at the hospital,
you'd seen Alexis.

1:17:31.985 --> 1:17:34.071

I've already sent it to my editor,

1:18:03.767 --> 1:18:06.520
He'll be distributing it
to your Internal Affairs Division.

1:18:07.771 --> 1:18:08.981
Look at you.

1:18:09.982 --> 1:18:12.943
You are a smart one, after all, huh?

1:18:13.986 --> 1:18:14.903
Well...

1:18:15.779 --> 1:18:20.033
I guess we just gonna have
to do this a different way, huh?
