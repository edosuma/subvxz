02:07.218 --> 02:09.402
I want to have someone like you

02:09.985 --> 02:11.943
like the gentle breeze through the hills

02:13.276 --> 02:15.276
like the warm sunshine in an old town

02:16.068 --> 02:17.568
as long as it's you in the end.

02:18.568 --> 02:20.110
Who have you passed by today,

02:20.526 --> 02:21.818
and who has lost you?

02:24.151 --> 02:25.443
Passing Through Your World.

02:26.943 --> 02:28.031
This is Chen Mo.

02:28.443 --> 02:29.599
This is Xiao Rong.

02:30.485 --> 02:31.860
Hello there.

02:33.151 --> 02:34.360
Mr. Chen Mo

02:34.860 --> 02:36.235
it's my birthday today.

02:37.401 --> 02:38.421
Happy birthday.

02:38.485 --> 02:40.526
But I'm spending it alone.

02:41.526 --> 02:42.527
It's okay.

02:42.735 --> 02:44.526
I'm here for you

02:44.943 --> 02:46.026
I feel so lonely.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.193
If it weren't for your show,

02:48.235 --> 02:49.735
I might have given up.

02:49.985 --> 02:51.151
I'll let you in on a secret.

02:51.985 --> 02:53.985
There is this place, called Daocheng

02:54.735 --> 02:56.026
I want to go there...

02:56.068 --> 02:57.318
with my sweetheart,

02:57.901 --> 02:59.151
to see the crystal blue sky,

02:59.568 --> 03:00.943
the snowy mountains,

03:01.443 --> 03:03.110
the golden meadows,

03:03.860 --> 03:06.360
to experience an autumn fairy tale

03:08.193 --> 03:09.235
I want to tell her that,

03:10.526 --> 03:12.318
residing in any place but your heart...

03:12.901 --> 03:14.801
is no different than
dying in a foreign land

03:14.943 --> 03:15.985
I want to tell her that,

03:16.775 --> 03:17.943
being in love...

03:18.526 --> 03:20.151
means staying together forever.

03:21.775 --> 03:23.193
Then she must be going with you.

03:25.443 --> 03:27.485
Someday, you will be there too.

03:28.026 --> 03:29.526
That's why you need to be courageous.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.943
Remember this: strength, in anybody,

03:32.151 --> 03:33.860
is gentleness grown callous.

03:34.901 --> 03:36.235
Next, a song.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.235
For all those who are alone

03:39.526 --> 03:40.693
may you never feel lonely.

03:45.151 --> 03:46.152
You liked that?

03:47.901 --> 03:48.902
Mo.

03:52.068 --> 03:53.193
Let's break up.

03:56.318 --> 03:57.319
What?

04:01.693 --> 04:03.026
I've thought about it for a long time.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.151
You're a great DJ,

04:06.026 --> 04:07.276
but not a good lover.

04:07.526 --> 04:09.610
Why can't great DJs be
good lovers as well?

04:09.693 --> 04:11.484
I don't understand what you mean.

04:11.901 --> 04:12.901
What?!

04:20.067 --> 04:21.067
You win.

04:48.315 --> 04:55.334
[I Belonged To You]

04:59.483 --> 05:01.442
There are a million ways to die.
[Two Years Later]

05:01.901 --> 05:02.901
Which one...

05:03.026 --> 05:04.401
would you choose?

05:08.526 --> 05:09.733
What I mean is

05:10.401 --> 05:13.026
today, we won't talk about living.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.192
Let's talk about dying.

05:15.776 --> 05:18.692
Now, a song for you.

05:19.108 --> 05:20.233
Let's get the party started!

05:20.983 --> 05:24.276
Unexpectedly pregnant?
Come to Jianguo Hospital.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.942
Have the abortion today,
back to work tomorrow.

05:44.942 --> 05:46.692
What noise!
Turn off the radio!

05:51.901 --> 05:53.358
Mr. Driver, it's too loud.

05:53.733 --> 05:54.959
What a lousy show.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.026
How this show has deteriorated...

06:02.651 --> 06:03.651
With all this nonsense,

06:03.817 --> 06:05.233
I don't even want to place
my advertising in there.

06:05.483 --> 06:06.942
This show still has potential

06:07.151 --> 06:08.776
I don't want to give up on it just yet

06:09.483 --> 06:11.276
I'm checking out a VR project tonight.

06:11.401 --> 06:12.901
Why don't you come with me?

06:12.901 --> 06:14.483
If it goes well,
you can be a co-investor.

06:14.858 --> 06:15.858
Chen Mo,

06:15.858 --> 06:17.317
I feel very confused right now.

06:17.692 --> 06:18.692
Confused, how?

06:18.694 --> 06:19.776
My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

06:19.901 --> 06:20.901
So?

06:20.903 --> 06:22.817
She is marrying my ex-boyfriend

06:23.192 --> 06:24.776
I feel so confused.

06:25.358 --> 06:26.360
So?

06:26.391 --> 06:27.567
Next!

06:27.569 --> 06:29.192
Mo, when the hell are you coming home?

06:29.192 --> 06:30.276
Your mom was making soup

06:30.358 --> 06:31.776
and she put detergent in there again.

06:32.026 --> 06:33.442
Bubbles everywhere!

06:33.526 --> 06:34.733
Get back here and deal with it!

06:35.233 --> 06:36.254
This is my Mom.

06:36.293 --> 06:38.565
She started having
Alzheimer's three years ago.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.317
She's fine most of the time,
but she gets pretty creative when cooking

06:40.610 --> 06:41.692
putting all kinds of stuff into the pot.

06:41.942 --> 06:43.891
This is my cousin, Mao Shiba.

06:43.901 --> 06:44.901
Life...

06:45.276 --> 06:46.442
is like a bunch of bubbles.

06:47.401 --> 06:48.526
He likes toying with
electronic appliances.

06:49.026 --> 06:51.026
An inventor with no dreams

06:51.358 --> 06:52.817
I've turned it into an Air Fryer.

06:55.442 --> 06:58.067
Mao Shiba, causing trouble again, huh?

06:59.026 --> 07:00.774
Always causing trouble on
the road of invention.

07:00.776 --> 07:01.776
Pay for my pot.

07:01.781 --> 07:04.026
He successfully got the attention
of Police Officer Lychee.

07:10.067 --> 07:11.233
Mao Shiba

07:11.442 --> 07:13.776
it's your thirteenth
explosion this month!

07:22.733 --> 07:24.526
This is Chubby,
my best friend from college

07:24.526 --> 07:25.548
I hate wasting.

07:25.942 --> 07:27.733
He's been with his girlfriend
Yanzi for eight years.

07:27.942 --> 07:30.067
Tutoring, driving pirate
taxis, running restaurants...

07:30.317 --> 07:31.942
He has done it all,
whatever pays the bill.

07:32.026 --> 07:33.026
And when he gets paid,

07:33.026 --> 07:35.233
he wires the money to his Yanzi overseas.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.360
Look,

07:39.360 --> 07:41.858
this is Yanzi in the US, and in London.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.610
She even went to Africa. No no no.

07:43.733 --> 07:44.983
Too much skin in this one.

07:47.610 --> 07:50.144
They developed a habit of eating
and sleeping in my house,

07:50.151 --> 07:51.233
and what makes it worse is...

07:51.858 --> 07:53.774
I have grown used to their company.

07:53.776 --> 07:54.865
This is for Mom.

07:55.276 --> 07:57.442
You're healthy human beings!

07:57.526 --> 08:00.401
Why don't I break one of your arms
and have you beg on the street?

08:00.483 --> 08:02.651
This is lukewarm.
It's better when it's searing hot.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.151
Searing hot, huh?

08:09.942 --> 08:11.233
That's Miss Xiao Rong.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.817
She has so many awards.

08:14.983 --> 08:16.358
Best program.

08:20.391 --> 08:21.391
Look at you...

08:21.892 --> 08:23.350
fawny sycophants!

08:23.399 --> 08:24.567
Instead of learning the ropes

08:25.067 --> 08:26.817
you just kiss asses.
Let me tell you something.

08:26.942 --> 08:28.358
When I become Director...

08:28.567 --> 08:29.567
Madame Director. Madame Director.

08:29.651 --> 08:32.150
What's the big deal about being Director?

08:32.359 --> 08:33.403
Madame Director!

08:33.404 --> 08:35.150
Long live Madame Director, and uh...

08:35.359 --> 08:38.067
please, feel free to humiliate me.

08:40.442 --> 08:41.609
Your ratings.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.275
The worst show at this station.

08:43.299 --> 08:44.609
If you don't make an effort,

08:44.650 --> 08:46.984
none of these interns will
want to work with you.

08:47.191 --> 08:49.067
What shall I do then? Team up with you?

08:49.234 --> 08:51.191
My name is Chen Mo.
Your name is Xiao Rong.

08:51.275 --> 08:52.609
Our new show could be called...

08:52.692 --> 08:53.817
Madame Mo!

08:53.900 --> 08:54.902
No.

08:55.027 --> 08:56.234
What else then?

08:56.484 --> 08:57.900
Since your hair is so short,

08:57.984 --> 08:59.317
eyes so small and face so wide,

08:59.442 --> 09:00.734
why don't I marry you?

09:00.817 --> 09:02.775
Here we go again... Get lost!

09:03.442 --> 09:04.443
Get what?

09:05.775 --> 09:07.567
Get in your bed?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.234
Get out of my sight!

09:10.150 --> 09:12.942
Anyone here wants to
intern with Mr. Chen Mo?

09:15.609 --> 09:16.734
I do.

09:19.525 --> 09:20.775
Good morning, Mr. Chen Mo

09:21.027 --> 09:22.027
I'm Birdie.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.719
Like the small bird in Mahjong?

09:24.942 --> 09:26.711
Then call me White Dragon.

09:44.942 --> 09:45.942
Not again...

09:46.234 --> 09:47.525
Mao Shiba!

09:49.984 --> 09:51.142
Stop right there!

09:54.984 --> 09:55.984
Stop!

09:55.985 --> 09:57.400
You haven't paid me!

09:59.900 --> 10:01.027
Stop running!

10:03.525 --> 10:04.900
Stop!

10:07.275 --> 10:08.400
What have I done this time?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.150
What were you running away for?

10:10.191 --> 10:11.275
What were you chasing me for?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.984
You guys put up all these
posters on the wall, right?

10:14.442 --> 10:16.859
Madame Lychee, I'm sorry about this.

10:16.859 --> 10:18.234
What did you do?

10:19.027 --> 10:20.484
Not bad!

10:20.567 --> 10:22.275
You two finally showed some gratitude!

10:22.317 --> 10:23.609
After living off me for so long...

10:23.692 --> 10:24.693
Not bad!

10:25.984 --> 10:28.150
Such good handwriting, and no mistakes.

10:28.191 --> 10:29.775
You really think it's me?

10:30.484 --> 10:32.734
Mo, this won't get you much attention.

10:32.817 --> 10:34.359
Let me start a newsletter for you.

10:35.942 --> 10:36.984
Arrest them.

10:47.484 --> 10:49.440
Why are you always pissing
off the police officer?

10:49.442 --> 10:50.442
I didn't.

10:51.775 --> 10:53.109
So she's just running
after you for no reason?

10:53.191 --> 10:55.109
I figure these old buildings
will be gone soon.

10:55.275 --> 10:56.275
Let's leave the posters here.

10:56.275 --> 10:57.859
Cut the crap! Get rid of them!

10:59.317 --> 11:01.567
Shiba, come here.

11:04.275 --> 11:06.027
Yup?

11:06.567 --> 11:08.692
You're sweating. Are you tired?

11:12.984 --> 11:15.525
What were you whispering
about back there?

11:18.400 --> 11:19.567
He said you were trying to date me.

11:25.067 --> 11:27.775
Shiba, you really do only tell the truth

11:27.900 --> 11:29.859
I'm already so busy exploring
the truth of the universe

11:29.900 --> 11:31.609
I don't have time for lying.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.109
Let me clean you up.

11:35.692 --> 11:37.484
Passing Through Your World.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.859
Hi there. I'm Chen Mo.

11:41.734 --> 11:43.609
Something's different today at our show.

11:43.692 --> 11:45.317
Her Majesty the Director...

11:45.692 --> 11:49.817
...paired me up with the
most talented intern.

11:50.442 --> 11:52.942
Her name is... Birdie.

11:53.027 --> 11:55.317
That being said, feel free to ignore her.

11:55.359 --> 11:56.984
Well, we have a caller online.

11:57.109 --> 11:58.109
Hello.

11:58.118 --> 11:58.943
Chen Mo

11:58.984 --> 12:00.234
I think my wife is having an affair.

12:00.359 --> 12:01.730
Are there any grounds for your suspicion?

12:01.734 --> 12:02.984
She used to have noodles
with me seven days a week,

12:03.067 --> 12:04.400
without a word of complaint.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.109
So I promised myself that...

12:06.275 --> 12:09.109
I would succeed in my career,
and I would treat her right.

12:09.234 --> 12:10.359
Lately, when I brought home...

12:10.525 --> 12:11.650
...the same assorted pea noodles
from the same takeout

12:12.109 --> 12:13.191
she won't even touch them.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.275
Tell me, isn't it obvious
she's having an affair?

12:15.359 --> 12:19.692
As the old saying goes,
"plenty of other fish in the sea"

12:20.609 --> 12:23.027
just as there are plenty
of cuckoos in the tree.

12:24.027 --> 12:25.400
And they go,

12:25.567 --> 12:27.027
Cuckold! Cuckold!

12:27.525 --> 12:28.775
Chen Mo, you're rubbish.

12:28.817 --> 12:29.859
Your show is rubbish.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.359
Even rubbish has some value.

12:31.408 --> 12:32.275
You're just a dumbass.

12:32.277 --> 12:33.942
Shut up, how old are you?

12:34.067 --> 12:35.157
Thirty-two. Why?

12:35.168 --> 12:36.150
Thirty-two...

12:36.191 --> 12:37.567
That's almost half a lifetime.

12:38.317 --> 12:39.817
She's been having noodles everyday.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.984
What if she wants to have
dumplings for a change?

12:42.109 --> 12:44.067
You know why you're not successful?

12:44.109 --> 12:46.067
Because you spend all day
worrying about nonsense.

12:46.191 --> 12:47.900
Don't you have something better to do?

12:47.942 --> 12:49.359
I'm guessing you don't.

12:49.650 --> 12:51.317
How can I be so sure?

12:51.525 --> 12:52.900
Because you're not man enough!

12:53.027 --> 12:55.692
Your wife must be blind to
pick you as her husband.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.777
Blind!

12:56.777 --> 12:58.275
B-L-I-N-D!

12:58.359 --> 12:59.442
Next!

13:08.859 --> 13:10.775
I'm so sorry.

13:28.734 --> 13:29.735
Next.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.027
Have some noodles.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.735
You spy.

13:41.942 --> 13:43.484
Xiao Rong sent you, didn't she?

13:44.942 --> 13:46.357
I just can't stand people
calling you names.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.442
Don't try to explain.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.109
She placed you at my side.

13:49.817 --> 13:52.234
So what if I've given up on myself?

13:52.484 --> 13:54.774
So what if nobody listens to my show?

13:54.775 --> 13:56.109
I'm not going anywhere

13:56.400 --> 13:58.400
I insist on going down with my show!

13:59.027 --> 14:00.027
Yeah!

14:02.359 --> 14:03.442
Mr. Chen Mo

14:04.234 --> 14:05.900
what can I do to earn your forgiveness?

14:05.984 --> 14:06.985
Simple.

14:07.567 --> 14:08.775
Don't ever let me see you again,

14:09.150 --> 14:10.152
okay?

14:11.650 --> 14:12.652
Now get lost.

14:14.900 --> 14:15.942
Get lost!

14:52.984 --> 14:55.275
There's been something
unexpected this week.

14:55.984 --> 14:56.985
Chen Mo.

14:57.609 --> 14:58.610
Chen Mo.

15:08.525 --> 15:10.609
Congratulations. The ratings
went through the roof.

15:10.692 --> 15:11.714
Second highest.

15:14.609 --> 15:15.775
Keep up the good work.

15:19.359 --> 15:20.734
Have my fans lost their mind?

15:21.109 --> 15:23.359
Have they chosen to listen
to the radio all day...

15:23.609 --> 15:25.484
instead of caring about
the reality around them?

15:26.525 --> 15:27.984
Come on, flatter me.

15:29.958 --> 15:33.875
Every time Birdie loses it,
the ratings go up.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.042
Fascinating.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.833
What do you put on this ugly thing for?

15:52.167 --> 15:53.625
Here. Put it over your eye.

15:56.792 --> 15:58.167
Well, you said that...

15:59.417 --> 16:00.958
you never wanted to see me again.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.333
With this, you don't have to see me.

16:06.292 --> 16:07.293
Birdie,

16:08.208 --> 16:09.875
this idea of yours is just brilliant.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.000
Don't tell anyone that I'm your mentor

16:12.042 --> 16:13.131
I appreciate it.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.625
Mr. Chen Mo, I'm sorry

16:16.792 --> 16:18.208
I'll keep my mouth shut

16:18.333 --> 16:19.707
I'll do better. Whatever you say.

16:19.708 --> 16:20.708
Don't!

16:22.833 --> 16:23.833
Don't do anything differently

16:23.850 --> 16:25.292
I just love how you...

16:26.333 --> 16:29.167
erupt with unexpected eloquence.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.626
Keep it up,

16:31.875 --> 16:32.876
okay?

16:33.583 --> 16:34.708
Mr. Chen Mo,

16:34.833 --> 16:36.167
are you being sarcastic?

16:38.042 --> 16:39.417
Come to work earlier.

16:39.667 --> 16:40.833
Do some work with the studio.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.815
Make it nice and clean.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.791
Yanzi, you've become even prettier.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.041
You're so pretty.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.294
I mean it.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.666
Yanzi, look.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.541
It's ugly. Who designed it for you?

17:34.625 --> 17:35.625
Is it?

17:35.700 --> 17:36.459
Why didn't you talk to me...

17:36.667 --> 17:38.000
before you got that tattoo?

17:38.084 --> 17:39.792
I wanted to surprise you.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.209
It's alright. I have another surprise

17:46.875 --> 17:48.541
I bought this dress for you.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.771
Do you like it?

17:49.792 --> 17:51.334
It's quite an arrogant brand.

17:51.417 --> 17:52.642
Must be expensive.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.709
Nah. The price is actually very cute.

17:54.792 --> 17:55.794
Smart of you.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.666
Wait. Didn't you say
Mo's wifi isn't working?

17:58.667 --> 18:01.667
Are you using all your data?

18:02.250 --> 18:05.000
It's all worth it as long
as I get to see you.

18:05.917 --> 18:06.919
It's alright.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.084
Alright. I'm going to
see the waterfall now.

18:09.292 --> 18:10.519
Take care of yourself.

18:10.521 --> 18:11.750
Let's talk when I get back.

18:14.959 --> 18:17.750
Oh my, that must have
been an expensive call.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.584
I have to go. I'm running late.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.042
Chubby

18:28.209 --> 18:29.541
what's that?

18:29.709 --> 18:30.709
Nothing.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.334
- Show me.
- I'm going to work as well.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.500
Show me.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.959
"Ten yuan for a punch."

18:41.584 --> 18:42.583
What is this?

18:42.584 --> 18:43.584
Just a side job

18:44.084 --> 18:45.856
I can make money with this.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.250
Something's up with you lately.

18:48.459 --> 18:49.833
Have you gotten into trouble?

18:49.834 --> 18:50.789
Are you desperate for money?

18:50.792 --> 18:52.209
You need to fix your wifi.

18:53.042 --> 18:54.209
Ten yuan for a punch, huh?

18:54.917 --> 18:55.919
Twenty.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.125
Thirty.

18:57.183 --> 18:58.794
- Forty. Fifty.
- I...

18:59.000 --> 19:01.417
I discussed it with Shiba.
We decided not to tell you.

19:01.459 --> 19:02.667
It's not a small number.

19:02.792 --> 19:03.794
Tell me

19:03.875 --> 19:05.042
I can handle it.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.917
You would spend every last penny for me.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.167
Are you terminally ill?

19:11.417 --> 19:12.709
Dying?

19:13.209 --> 19:14.500
I'm buying an apartment.

19:16.209 --> 19:17.667
Dying seems better.

19:17.792 --> 19:18.794
Get back here!

19:19.250 --> 19:20.250
I'm serious.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.750
It takes a lot of money to
buy an apartment, Chubby

19:22.834 --> 19:24.125
I have money

19:27.334 --> 19:29.667
I wired some money to Yanzi every month.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.709
All the receipts are here

19:32.167 --> 19:33.750
I asked her to save it for me.

19:37.375 --> 19:38.459
200 thousand in total.

19:39.292 --> 19:40.334
Chubby

19:41.250 --> 19:42.917
can I be your girl?

19:43.917 --> 19:45.625
- No.
- Why?

19:46.250 --> 19:47.667
You're not as pretty as her

19:49.084 --> 19:50.084
20 thousand...

19:51.959 --> 19:55.084
You're living off me, and
you saved up 20 thousand.

19:59.042 --> 20:00.044
Mo,

20:01.125 --> 20:03.167
I just want to give Yanzi a home.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.250
That's all I have.

20:12.750 --> 20:13.875
200 thousand.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.834
Mo, I can't take this.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.084
Serves me right for
being friends with you.

20:27.417 --> 20:28.750
How much is the down payment?

20:28.834 --> 20:29.959
200 thousand.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.209
I could kill someone right now.

20:34.125 --> 20:35.292
What is it this time?

20:36.875 --> 20:37.903
Morning, Director.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.932
Morning, Director.

20:39.334 --> 20:41.834
Haven't I already wired
that into your account?

20:47.292 --> 20:49.875
Mr. Cao, how much more do I
need to invest in this project?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.084
What is the matter?

21:01.084 --> 21:02.084
Birdie.

21:04.042 --> 21:05.375
Miss Xiao Rong.

21:10.334 --> 21:11.541
You helped bring...

21:11.584 --> 21:13.709
Chen Mo's show back to life.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.125
No no no. I'm way too
stupid and impulsive

21:16.250 --> 21:17.917
I've been dragging him down.

21:18.084 --> 21:19.085
Nonsense.

21:19.086 --> 21:21.417
Just make sure you don't end up like him.

21:21.584 --> 21:24.084
He's given up on himself.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.417
I think I heard my name.

21:29.541 --> 21:30.917
She has a lot of potential.

21:31.084 --> 21:32.541
Pity she's working with you.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.250
What filthy words.

21:35.334 --> 21:36.792
Cover your ears.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.625
Stealing. She's stealing from me.

21:39.709 --> 21:42.084
Everyone, she's stealing.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.292
She's stealing from me.

21:44.375 --> 21:45.625
- Mr. Manager.
- Chen Mo

21:45.690 --> 21:46.996
what are you yelling about?

21:46.996 --> 21:48.209
Someone's stealing from me.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.125
You know what stealing is?

21:50.209 --> 21:54.541
S-T-E-A-L-I-N-G, stealing!

21:54.625 --> 21:56.334
Despicable!

21:56.417 --> 21:57.625
Stealing from me!

21:57.709 --> 22:00.459
Stealing? All I see is you screaming

22:00.541 --> 22:03.292
I just don't want to see
Birdie's potential wasted.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.150
Birdie,

22:07.608 --> 22:09.692
did I waste your potential?

22:11.858 --> 22:13.358
I don't have any potential.

22:14.108 --> 22:15.358
That is true, actually.

22:17.358 --> 22:19.733
Mr. Manager, who do you believe,
Xiao Rong or me?

22:19.817 --> 22:21.067
Of course I believe Xiao Rong.

22:21.150 --> 22:22.151
Why?

22:22.192 --> 22:24.442
She's our top DJ.

22:24.525 --> 22:26.132
- What about me?
- Everyone knows...

22:26.134 --> 22:28.025
that you're our top loser.

22:28.858 --> 22:30.483
You know what, if I put my heart into it.

22:30.567 --> 22:32.733
I can get the highest ratings here.

22:33.108 --> 22:35.275
Highest ratings? Impossible.

22:35.483 --> 22:36.692
You wanna bet on it?

22:37.192 --> 22:38.317
Bet!
Bet!

22:38.318 --> 22:39.338
Daring me, huh?

22:39.400 --> 22:41.128
- Bet!
- You want a bet?

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
Bet! Bet!

22:46.025 --> 22:48.025
I, Chen Mo, promise that within a month

22:48.108 --> 22:49.858
the show hosted by me and Birdie...

22:49.942 --> 22:52.442
will have the highest
ratings in this station.

22:55.483 --> 22:57.275
That's the only trophy you have.

22:57.317 --> 22:58.608
Why didn't you say so?

23:01.275 --> 23:03.192
That's great.
What do you think the stakes should be?

23:03.275 --> 23:04.900
What are the stakes?

23:04.901 --> 23:06.650
What are the stakes?

23:08.775 --> 23:10.567
Take a look at this lady here

23:10.650 --> 23:12.608
with her protruding cheekbones

23:13.400 --> 23:15.442
her tiny lips

23:15.525 --> 23:17.650
her dim eyes

23:17.733 --> 23:19.692
and her peculiar features.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.608
She has what we call a typical...

23:22.692 --> 23:24.442
widow face.

23:26.692 --> 23:29.025
Whoever marries her...
will be unlucky all his life.

23:29.901 --> 23:30.903
Tell you what.

23:30.903 --> 23:32.275
If I win,

23:33.108 --> 23:34.317
I'll marry you.

23:36.775 --> 23:39.275
Marry him. Marry him. Marry him.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.799
That's quite some bet.

23:40.817 --> 23:41.818
Marry him.

23:41.819 --> 23:43.650
Marry him.

23:44.942 --> 23:47.233
You're always so immature

23:47.775 --> 23:48.926
I don't want to be...

23:48.928 --> 23:50.011
totally ruthless.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.567
If I win,

23:51.650 --> 23:53.525
you host on a parade with
a sign around your neck.

23:53.608 --> 23:54.609
Parade?

23:57.317 --> 23:59.525
Madame Director, what will the sign say?

24:07.483 --> 24:08.567
I'm an idiot.

24:08.650 --> 24:09.942
Well said.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.525
Let's hear it

24:13.567 --> 24:14.567
I'm an idiot.

24:16.067 --> 24:17.067
I'm an idiot.

24:18.358 --> 24:20.608
What's the big deal? I don't mind.

24:22.317 --> 24:24.025
If you marry me

24:24.029 --> 24:26.150
you'll face domestic violence every day

24:26.358 --> 24:28.817
I will make clear to
everyone around us that...

24:28.901 --> 24:30.067
my wife

24:30.150 --> 24:32.025
can be slapped.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.733
That's enough. Go back to work, everyone.

25:28.483 --> 25:31.525
Mom, what are you doing here again?

25:32.192 --> 25:33.608
I'm waiting for my son

25:34.192 --> 25:36.358
I'm here. You don't need to wait.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.733
My son has a wife. You don't.

25:40.817 --> 25:43.483
Here we go again...
You always say that

25:43.608 --> 25:45.650
always hurting me like that

25:45.775 --> 25:47.275
I'll call him

25:48.400 --> 25:50.192
tell him to come home for dinner.

25:50.775 --> 25:52.650
Alright. I'll wait with you.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.401
Hello.

26:03.525 --> 26:04.526
Mom.

26:05.525 --> 26:07.275
Do you know what time it is?

26:07.525 --> 26:09.067
You said you'd be home for dinner

26:09.275 --> 26:11.400
I'm waiting for you. Come home now.

26:12.817 --> 26:14.858
Mom, turn your head.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.525
What's your name, Mr. Chen?

26:27.442 --> 26:29.108
Take a guess, Madame Liu.

26:33.608 --> 26:35.733
What are you doing here, Mr. Chen?

26:35.983 --> 26:38.233
Bringing you food, Madame Liu

26:39.275 --> 26:42.733
I won't eat. I won't eat
till my son comes back.

26:43.025 --> 26:45.442
Madame Liu, it's your son who
asked me to bring you these.

26:45.650 --> 26:46.775
My son asked you?

26:46.901 --> 26:48.776
- It's wonton.
- Wonton.

27:18.377 --> 27:22.013
You are listening to Asia's
pop music channel 101.7.

27:22.013 --> 27:23.655
- I'm Ding Ding.
- I'm Wong Kai.

27:23.655 --> 27:24.705
I'm Xiao Chu.

27:24.705 --> 27:28.082
This is the Sound of Szechuan 92.5 FM.

27:28.082 --> 27:29.871
I'm your host Xiao Dong.

27:30.209 --> 27:34.615
You're listening to Jiangtsu's
radio station's traffic program.

27:35.176 --> 27:37.467
This is City Radio, FM90.2

27:37.468 --> 27:39.009
Passing Through Your World

27:39.010 --> 27:40.010
I'm Chen Mo.

27:40.301 --> 27:41.301
I'm Birdie

27:41.318 --> 27:42.323
I'm getting married

27:42.323 --> 27:44.635
but my mother-in-law always
checks my phone behind my back.

27:45.343 --> 27:46.926
When I confronted her

27:47.135 --> 27:48.343
my husband not only didn't take my side

27:48.510 --> 27:49.593
but also called me inconsiderate.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.219
He even hit me.

27:51.384 --> 27:53.093
Then don't marry him

27:53.260 --> 27:55.093
I don't even want to live anymore.

27:55.219 --> 27:56.635
Then marry him.

28:00.926 --> 28:02.219
But...

28:02.760 --> 28:04.593
life is a long journey.

28:06.384 --> 28:09.801
Once you make a poor choice

28:10.135 --> 28:13.219
your life becomes a living hell...

28:13.551 --> 28:15.051
full of frustration and horror.

28:15.801 --> 28:17.426
Take me for example.

28:18.260 --> 28:19.676
After my ex-girlfriend...

28:19.968 --> 28:21.760
dumped me

28:21.926 --> 28:24.635
her life became a total mess.

28:24.801 --> 28:26.343
Now

28:26.551 --> 28:28.900
she keeps getting uglier.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.593
So, thank you for calling.

28:32.468 --> 28:34.885
Mr. Cao, can you tell me what's going on?

28:35.093 --> 28:36.384
What do you mean?

28:36.676 --> 28:37.843
With my money.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.135
Your money...

28:39.176 --> 28:40.676
might be gone at this moment

28:40.801 --> 28:42.468
but in a year or two,

28:42.635 --> 28:43.885
when the economy recovers...

28:44.093 --> 28:45.885
That's not what you told me before.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.343
Do you have any special talents?

29:04.843 --> 29:06.885
My mom always says that I
don't have any talents...

29:06.968 --> 29:08.176
except for my tolerance.

29:08.176 --> 29:10.176
No matter how nasty people get,
I don't talk back.

29:10.301 --> 29:13.093
Then how come you didn't hold
your tongue with that caller?

29:13.176 --> 29:15.135
But that guy was nasty to YOU!

29:16.843 --> 29:19.551
You're a smooth talker, aren't ya?

29:19.843 --> 29:21.635
For a young lady

29:21.843 --> 29:24.093
you're not pretty at all.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.426
You're right. I'm aware.

29:27.301 --> 29:29.593
For a young lady who's not pretty,

29:30.135 --> 29:32.051
you're always slouching.

29:32.093 --> 29:33.510
No elegance.

29:34.260 --> 29:36.260
Mr. Chen Mo, you're right on.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.551
For a young lady with no elegance

29:39.760 --> 29:40.885
you have zero self-confidence.

29:40.968 --> 29:41.969
You're Birdie!

29:42.176 --> 29:44.510
Be a birdie with shiny feathers!

29:44.593 --> 29:47.260
But you, you're a birdie
with no feathers at all!

29:50.676 --> 29:53.093
Well, what do I do then?

29:53.219 --> 29:55.135
You're not gonna talk back?

29:55.301 --> 29:56.885
Well, you're right about everything.

30:02.635 --> 30:03.968
Mr. Chen Mo.

30:20.010 --> 30:21.926
Hello, Miss Birdie?

30:22.635 --> 30:24.219
Miss Birdie, hello.

30:24.426 --> 30:26.885
I just saw my friend's boyfriend...

30:27.051 --> 30:29.759
in the movie theatre
with another girl.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.468
Should I tell my friend?

30:31.635 --> 30:35.051
If I were you...
I'd tell her.

30:35.053 --> 30:36.843
Wrong! Who are you to
tell other people...

30:36.926 --> 30:38.426
what to do and what not to do?

30:38.551 --> 30:39.718
Miss Birdie

30:40.010 --> 30:42.093
why did you come to work at the station?

30:46.551 --> 30:49.342
Do you still fancy Xiao Rong,
your former partner?

30:49.343 --> 30:50.968
No chance.

30:51.135 --> 30:52.260
That stupid woman...

30:52.718 --> 30:54.260
How dare she dump me!

30:55.593 --> 30:58.510
She must have been out of her mind!

30:59.760 --> 31:01.884
Then why are you still working there?

31:01.885 --> 31:03.843
Don't you get annoyed,
seeing her everyday?

31:06.551 --> 31:07.593
Mr. Chen Mo,

31:07.676 --> 31:09.760
tell me what love is about.

31:10.135 --> 31:12.551
Love... Love... It's the beginning...

31:12.718 --> 31:14.301
of all kinds of stories.

31:17.635 --> 31:20.760
How do I move on from a
failed relationship?

31:20.801 --> 31:22.343
You had a failed relationship?

31:25.260 --> 31:27.593
How do I know if I'm
in love with someone?

31:29.426 --> 31:30.426
Little girl

31:30.843 --> 31:31.843
you're in love, huh?

31:47.718 --> 31:51.260
That's a very hard question
to answer, Mr. Chen Mo.

31:53.176 --> 31:54.718
Mr. Chen Mo.

32:13.510 --> 32:16.260
Mao Shiba, why are you running?

32:17.593 --> 32:19.135
Stop!

32:23.593 --> 32:24.676
Stop!

32:32.760 --> 32:34.219
What's in the basket?

32:35.843 --> 32:37.093
Stuff I recycled.

32:39.176 --> 32:41.676
Is that all?
Then why were you running?

32:42.219 --> 32:43.219
I'm scared of you.

32:44.676 --> 32:46.301
Am I that scary?

32:47.510 --> 32:50.843
If you're scared of me,
then answer these questions honestly.

32:54.426 --> 32:55.760
First question:

32:55.885 --> 32:58.926
Why were you disqualified for
the College Entrance Exams?

32:59.135 --> 33:00.136
I cheated.

33:00.384 --> 33:01.385
Then...

33:01.426 --> 33:03.760
why didn't you start
looking for a job?

33:03.801 --> 33:06.051
I have my cousin.
He takes care of me

33:06.301 --> 33:07.843
I can just live off him

33:08.301 --> 33:09.801
so I'm developing my own software.

33:09.885 --> 33:11.426
Next question.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.510
How many relationships have you had?

33:17.760 --> 33:19.676
If holding hands counts
as a relationship

33:19.801 --> 33:21.010
I've had three.

33:21.384 --> 33:23.343
If it has to include making love...

33:23.593 --> 33:24.760
then just one.

33:25.260 --> 33:26.635
How about you? How many?

33:34.760 --> 33:35.885
One.

33:38.843 --> 33:40.468
I almost got married.

33:41.635 --> 33:44.260
We agreed to meet in front
of the registration office

33:44.343 --> 33:46.343
I waited from morning
till the registration office closed

33:46.343 --> 33:47.343
but he never showed up.

33:47.349 --> 33:49.675
My dear, he said he forgot to
bring his residence certificate

33:49.676 --> 33:50.926
and you actually believed him?

33:50.926 --> 33:52.467
Even if his certificate is in the US,

33:52.468 --> 33:54.801
he could have come back in a day.

34:01.843 --> 34:03.926
That's why I hate lying.

34:18.592 --> 34:20.802
So you truly never lie, huh?

34:21.592 --> 34:23.802
I'm too busy exploring the
truths about the universe

34:24.552 --> 34:25.760
so I don't have time...

34:26.219 --> 34:27.219
for lying.

34:33.052 --> 34:35.260
Let me ask you one more question.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.427
Am I...

34:42.010 --> 34:43.052
pretty?

34:52.802 --> 34:53.802
Yes.

35:07.510 --> 35:09.385
Some love happens naturally.

35:09.927 --> 35:12.092
Some love disappears for reason.

35:12.677 --> 35:13.927
Though you can see it happening

35:14.260 --> 35:15.802
there's nothing you can do

35:38.135 --> 35:39.677
I have an apartment now

35:40.010 --> 35:42.177
I can get married now.

35:43.635 --> 35:44.717
Chubby,

35:44.927 --> 35:47.467
it's hard to think you've been
with Yanzi for eight years.

35:48.467 --> 35:49.677
Has it been eight years?

35:50.385 --> 35:52.927
I just remember it as 2,923 days

35:53.010 --> 35:55.052
I suck at math.
Don't take advantage of me.

35:56.260 --> 35:59.177
You practically used calculus when
you were planning how to live off me.

35:59.842 --> 36:01.385
Let the drinking begin!

36:02.010 --> 36:03.885
We'll have lots of chubby babies.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.760
Twenty of them!

36:07.260 --> 36:09.467
Chubby and Yanzi were
college sweethearts.

36:10.177 --> 36:12.260
Yanzi was the prettiest
girl at our university.

36:12.635 --> 36:14.510
Chubby started having a crush
on her in junior year...

36:14.677 --> 36:16.052
but never confessed his feelings

36:16.385 --> 36:18.177
until one day...

36:19.219 --> 36:22.385
Chubby was shocked to find that...
Yanzi had been publicly criticized.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.635
The notice said that Yanzi stole
2,000 yuan from a roommate.

36:25.635 --> 36:27.135
- This must be a mistake.
- She was given a warning punishment.

36:27.137 --> 36:28.197
Do you believe her?

36:28.199 --> 36:29.940
No need to get all worked up.

36:29.989 --> 36:30.989
Yanzi!

36:35.177 --> 36:38.135
That night, Chubby acted crazy

36:38.510 --> 36:40.052
running lap after lap

36:40.510 --> 36:42.177
till he collapsed with exhaustion.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.385
After that, he chose to...

36:45.760 --> 36:46.802
trust her...

36:47.092 --> 36:48.677
and never look back.

36:49.552 --> 36:50.717
From that day on

36:51.427 --> 36:53.260
Chubby would skip classes
to be a tutor

36:53.510 --> 36:55.677
and study with Yanzi
whenever he had time.

37:03.135 --> 37:05.467
Every day at morning and dusk

37:05.467 --> 37:07.967
everyone in our university
could see them...

37:08.552 --> 37:10.510
walking on this most
beautiful path on campus.

37:12.717 --> 37:14.467
That was our youth

37:15.092 --> 37:16.885
with all its glory

37:19.010 --> 37:20.802
I finally saved enough money

37:22.467 --> 37:24.760
and I went to see that girl

37:25.010 --> 37:26.302
I wanted her to tell everyone...

37:26.510 --> 37:28.302
that Yanzi didn't steal from her.

37:28.717 --> 37:31.177
But she had transferred
to another university.

37:31.927 --> 37:35.342
From then on, Yanzi was
stuck being the thief.

37:35.967 --> 37:37.467
Chubby believes her.

37:38.677 --> 37:39.967
Chubby does.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.010
Whenever it rains

37:45.802 --> 37:48.427
the road becomes filthy and muddy.

37:54.092 --> 37:55.094
I...

37:55.219 --> 37:56.717
Everyone steps over it

37:56.927 --> 37:58.177
I have only my life to give

37:59.677 --> 38:01.802
I work really hard to make more money.

38:02.552 --> 38:03.967
I want to give her everything

38:04.302 --> 38:06.092
I want to give Yanzi everything.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.135
Such devotion!

38:12.302 --> 38:14.802
You're such a Romeo,
only a bit larger.

38:16.052 --> 38:17.467
You're my hero.

38:26.817 --> 38:28.317
Yanzi is coming back next week.

38:31.108 --> 38:32.652
I'm going to propose to her.

38:32.817 --> 38:33.818
Come on.

38:37.442 --> 38:38.943
Get up, all of you!

38:39.067 --> 38:40.902
I want everyone to hear this!

38:40.983 --> 38:42.483
Yanzi!

38:42.652 --> 38:44.777
I love you!

38:47.902 --> 38:52.273
Did you hear that, Yanzi
I love you.

38:52.275 --> 38:54.398
Chubby's love is like an anchor.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.023
As long as he loves Yanzi,

38:56.025 --> 38:58.483
we are all still young.

39:02.349 --> 39:03.400
Here you go.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.483
Thank you.

39:05.777 --> 39:06.932
Morning. Morning.

39:07.025 --> 39:08.182
Morning. Morning.

39:14.527 --> 39:16.483
Mao Shiba and Lychee started dating

39:16.733 --> 39:18.442
and he moved out of my house.

39:18.652 --> 39:21.358
That little bastard used
all his intelligence...

39:21.358 --> 39:22.817
on pleasing a woman.

39:24.777 --> 39:26.108
Shiba.

39:26.652 --> 39:28.317
Get up!

39:41.317 --> 39:43.192
Good morning, Lychee.

39:43.608 --> 39:45.733
Why is the food from
last night still here?

39:46.527 --> 39:49.027
It's your love for me that I
want to keep fresh, not the food.

39:51.527 --> 39:53.067
Smooth talker.

39:53.652 --> 39:58.275
The sesame pancakes want you to get up.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.023
Just a little bit longer.

40:11.025 --> 40:13.275
Shiba, you're so lazy.

40:13.733 --> 40:15.692
I'm late. Do what you want

40:18.025 --> 40:19.983
I'm late.

40:21.275 --> 40:22.358
Don't go.

40:26.943 --> 40:29.567
One of us needs to go to work.

40:31.192 --> 40:33.817
I'll deal with you tonight.

40:38.527 --> 40:42.358
Clean up your room.

40:43.400 --> 40:48.817
Shiba, Shiba, I need an OS installed.

40:48.889 --> 40:51.483
- Just in time.
- Shiba.

40:51.652 --> 40:54.692
Shiba, Shiba, I need an OS installed.

41:00.858 --> 41:02.067
What's this?

41:04.943 --> 41:06.067
I made it for you.

41:06.192 --> 41:08.567
If you're in danger, it'll notify me

41:08.692 --> 41:09.817
and I'll come rescue you.

41:13.527 --> 41:14.777
You? Rescue me?

41:17.692 --> 41:18.713
I appreciate it.

41:19.815 --> 41:23.514
Thank you for listening to
ChungKing Radio FM.

41:23.514 --> 41:26.893
Let us accompany you as
you drive to happiness.

41:26.893 --> 41:33.811
This is ChangShia Music Channel.

41:33.811 --> 41:41.192
Hello, this is Guang Zhou FM 106.1

41:41.192 --> 41:42.797
Tonight from 5 till 7...

41:45.025 --> 41:46.358
I don't believe this.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.317
Why do you have to pick today to be sick?

41:49.317 --> 41:50.817
It's such a critical day.

41:51.233 --> 41:53.358
It's our final battle with Xiao Rong.

41:53.442 --> 41:54.943
We can't afford to lose.

41:56.567 --> 41:57.817
Drink some more of this medicine

41:58.025 --> 42:00.067
I'll drink some too,
in case you gave it to me.

42:03.599 --> 42:05.192
Actually, you don't need to be nervous

42:05.275 --> 42:07.777
One time, I did a live show
right before an operation.

42:08.233 --> 42:09.733
What kind of operation?

42:10.233 --> 42:11.275
I had a hemorrhoid on the
corner of my mouth.

42:11.733 --> 42:13.067
To hell with it!

42:14.817 --> 42:17.108
Today is a special occasion.

42:17.275 --> 42:19.902
If anybody misses
Passing Through Your World...

42:19.983 --> 42:22.858
brought to you by Chen Mo and Birdie

42:22.943 --> 42:24.567
you might as well...

42:24.817 --> 42:27.442
disappear from your world.

42:27.567 --> 42:30.317
Let's take our first call.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.402
Hello

42:31.527 --> 42:33.192
I only have one question.

42:33.192 --> 42:35.150
What do you do if the person
you love doesn't love you?

42:35.233 --> 42:37.067
What can you do about world peace?

42:37.233 --> 42:39.150
What can you do about the
origin of the universe?

42:39.317 --> 42:40.943
There are so many interesting
things going on,

42:41.025 --> 42:43.108
and here you are,
pining over the most boring one.

42:44.275 --> 42:46.858
Talking to you is an
insult to my intelligence.

42:46.943 --> 42:49.233
Read some classics before you
call in next time, alright?

42:49.442 --> 42:50.652
Next!

42:51.983 --> 42:52.985
Hello?

42:53.192 --> 42:54.442
Miss Birdie

42:54.858 --> 42:57.233
I've failed the
College Entrance Exams five times.

42:57.358 --> 42:59.358
Could you give me some encouragement?

43:00.567 --> 43:01.568
Hello?

43:01.599 --> 43:02.599
Miss Birdie

43:02.733 --> 43:04.150
why didn't you say something?

43:06.902 --> 43:09.150
No amount of disappointment
should lead to despair.

43:09.652 --> 43:11.025
Next.

43:13.317 --> 43:15.192
Hello?

43:15.400 --> 43:16.900
I'm Yuan Jiaze, from...

43:16.902 --> 43:18.983
Class 1, Year 3, Xinhua
Road Elementary School.

43:20.943 --> 43:22.652
Hello, Jiaze.

43:22.733 --> 43:24.317
My mom is sick.

43:24.442 --> 43:27.858
Dad said she'll be away for a long time.

43:28.067 --> 43:32.275
She can't make my favorite
potato dish anymore.

43:32.317 --> 43:33.858
So what did your mom say?

43:34.233 --> 43:35.235
She said

43:35.317 --> 43:37.652
Jiaze, you have to be strong.

43:37.733 --> 43:41.442
But I don't wanna be strong.
I want to have my mom's cooking.

43:41.567 --> 43:45.400
Jiaze wants to have Mom's cooking.

43:46.233 --> 43:49.025
So do I. I remember one summer vacation,

43:49.192 --> 43:50.400
before I went home

43:50.608 --> 43:52.858
I wrote my Mom a text message...

43:52.858 --> 43:55.358
with all the things I wanted to eat.

43:55.483 --> 43:57.275
There was stir-fried boiled pork

43:57.400 --> 44:00.567
spiced chicken, braised intestines

44:00.652 --> 44:03.608
preserved eggs, spicy corydoras

44:03.692 --> 44:06.983
cold dried tofu, and chicken leg.

44:07.902 --> 44:09.317
My mother...

44:09.400 --> 44:11.025
wrote back just two words.

44:11.943 --> 44:13.608
"You wish."

44:16.025 --> 44:18.150
When I got home that night...

44:18.317 --> 44:19.527
The ratings are so high.

44:19.567 --> 44:21.777
Looks like Miss Xiao Rong
will have to marry him.

44:22.067 --> 44:23.275
It seems they're going to end in first.

44:23.608 --> 44:24.858
I found that...

44:25.483 --> 44:27.733
every dish I had ordered...

44:28.817 --> 44:30.442
was right there on the table

44:34.483 --> 44:36.777
I'm starting to miss my mom's dumplings.

44:38.317 --> 44:40.652
My mom passed away when
I was in high school

44:42.067 --> 44:43.858
I was always scared when I was little

44:44.275 --> 44:45.777
so Mom said to me

44:46.442 --> 44:47.652
Birdie

44:48.527 --> 44:51.442
you're the smallest tile
in a Mahjong set...

44:54.150 --> 44:55.152
Birdie.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.943
But you have to stay strong.

44:57.025 --> 44:58.025
That's right.

44:58.025 --> 45:00.980
Small as Birdie is, without it you
can't have a hand of Thirteen Orphans.

45:00.983 --> 45:03.150
Alright. Thank you for calling in.

45:03.233 --> 45:04.943
How come it's so cold?

45:05.025 --> 45:07.233
Is it snowing?

45:08.527 --> 45:11.483
Snowing? Your fever is
producing 3D effects.

45:11.567 --> 45:12.817
Three Defats?

45:13.777 --> 45:16.858
This caller has such a peculiar name.

45:17.817 --> 45:19.317
Listen to me.

45:19.777 --> 45:21.817
When you have made up your mind...

45:22.275 --> 45:24.902
to do anything and
everything for someone

45:25.233 --> 45:27.233
you will become a fool

45:27.483 --> 45:28.733
deaf

45:29.108 --> 45:30.983
blind to anything...

45:31.108 --> 45:33.317
but that person.

45:34.192 --> 45:35.733
Even the pain...

45:35.983 --> 45:39.442
becomes a test for love

45:40.192 --> 45:43.358
and yet you tell yourself

45:43.983 --> 45:45.733
with a sense of ridiculous innocence

45:46.692 --> 45:48.483
to be strong.

45:49.777 --> 45:51.692
So what if we left halfway
through the show?

45:51.817 --> 45:53.608
It's kind of a style, you know.

45:54.943 --> 45:55.983
Why?

45:56.192 --> 45:57.692
Let me tell you why

45:57.692 --> 45:59.317
I just love ruining what I've achieved.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.402
Keep it down.

46:00.402 --> 46:01.402
Sorry. Sorry.

46:23.817 --> 46:24.983
Birdie

46:26.858 --> 46:28.317
when you get better

46:28.608 --> 46:30.067
if there's anything you want to do

46:31.358 --> 46:32.943
I'll help you do it.

46:33.527 --> 46:35.442
There's somewhere I want to go

46:36.608 --> 46:38.067
a place called Daocheng

46:39.150 --> 46:41.652
I heard it's beautiful.

46:44.632 --> 46:45.634
Sure.

46:46.757 --> 46:47.759
We'll go.

46:53.717 --> 46:55.298
What are you doing, Shiba?

46:56.967 --> 46:58.465
What's this you're working on?

46:58.842 --> 47:00.134
It's a GPS navigator.

47:00.465 --> 47:03.507
Hi, I'm the private navigator
for Lychee and Shiba.

47:03.923 --> 47:05.423
Why is it your voice?

47:05.882 --> 47:06.952
I spent a month...

47:06.954 --> 47:09.048
replacing all the
original audio files.

47:09.757 --> 47:11.423
Driver, would you cut your nails?

47:11.423 --> 47:13.423
What if I don't want to hear
your voice all the time?

47:13.923 --> 47:14.925
I'm hungry.

47:16.465 --> 47:17.467
Alright.

47:17.757 --> 47:19.590
Let's go eat, at a nice restaurant.

47:20.632 --> 47:21.632
What are we having?

47:22.717 --> 47:23.717
Up to you.

47:24.048 --> 47:27.257
Can I count on you this time?

47:29.798 --> 47:31.173
I'll look it up on Baidu Map.

47:31.590 --> 47:33.590
The 100-per-person one,
or 300-per-person?

47:33.923 --> 47:35.340
The cheap one.

47:38.007 --> 47:39.092
Lychee

47:39.465 --> 47:40.923
you always look at the sky while walking,

47:41.423 --> 47:42.923
and you have a terrible
sense of direction.

47:43.340 --> 47:44.882
You say you don't want to travel far

47:45.134 --> 47:46.340
in case you can't get back.

47:47.007 --> 47:48.298
You don't need to worry anymore.

47:48.717 --> 47:51.298
You don't need to remember all the
street names, don't need to buy maps

47:51.798 --> 47:53.548
I'll be in this navigator

47:54.007 --> 47:55.215
always there for you.

47:56.215 --> 47:57.882
As long as the sun rises

47:58.382 --> 48:00.507
the navigator will always be charged

48:02.134 --> 48:03.134
and I...

48:03.548 --> 48:05.257
will always be there by your side.

48:06.215 --> 48:07.465
You're an idiot.

48:07.798 --> 48:08.800
I'm an idiot.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.757
You're an idiot.

48:12.215 --> 48:14.382
You know, we only ran half a show

48:14.507 --> 48:16.842
and we still ended up second.
What does that say?

48:17.548 --> 48:18.757
That you're awesome

48:19.340 --> 48:20.342
I'm an idiot.

48:20.342 --> 48:21.842
You're an idiot

48:22.215 --> 48:23.215
I'm an idiot.

48:23.217 --> 48:24.257
You're an idiot

48:24.757 --> 48:25.759
I'm an idiot.

48:25.759 --> 48:28.048
You're an idiot

48:28.423 --> 48:30.007
- I'm an idiot.
- You're an idiot.

48:30.048 --> 48:31.757
Mr. Chen Mo, I'm so sorry.

48:32.173 --> 48:33.798
Why did I have to be sick?

48:35.007 --> 48:36.599
I'm still too green at
these competitions.

48:36.599 --> 48:37.632
What's this?

48:37.634 --> 48:40.173
What's wrong with a parade?
We could do it with grace.

48:40.717 --> 48:45.590
The slender leaves, works of
art by the February breeze

48:45.967 --> 48:48.465
I'm an idiot. You're an idiot.

48:48.882 --> 48:49.884
I'm an idiot.

48:49.889 --> 48:50.889
You're an idiot.

48:50.889 --> 48:52.423
Mr. Chen Mo, please don't give up on me

48:52.465 --> 48:54.507
I hate those who don't concentrate.

48:54.590 --> 48:56.173
You can't even concentrate on the parade.

48:56.923 --> 48:58.173
You're an idiot.

48:58.173 --> 48:59.257
You're an idiot

48:59.340 --> 49:00.340
I'm an idiot.

49:00.340 --> 49:01.423
You're an idiot

49:01.798 --> 49:02.798
I'm an idiot.

49:02.798 --> 49:04.465
You're an idiot.

49:04.507 --> 49:07.007
Idiot! Idiot!

49:13.382 --> 49:14.842
Come with me to pick someone up.

49:20.173 --> 49:21.215
Thanks.

49:22.340 --> 49:23.798
Yanzi. Birdie.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.967
Hello. Hello.

49:27.257 --> 49:28.548
Where's Chubby?

49:29.007 --> 49:31.340
Welcome to the engagement
party of Yanzi and me

49:33.215 --> 49:35.465
I've known Yanzi for eight years.

49:36.134 --> 49:38.717
That's 2,929 days

49:39.092 --> 49:40.757
I think about her every
second of every day.

49:40.798 --> 49:42.298
She's the only one in my life.

49:42.465 --> 49:44.382
And at night, I dream about her.

49:44.632 --> 49:46.382
Sometimes I wonder...

49:46.590 --> 49:49.632
if there's anything in the world
that's more important than her.

49:51.423 --> 49:52.425
There isn't.

49:58.967 --> 50:00.092
There never will be.

50:00.507 --> 50:02.382
Yanzi is all I need.

50:02.382 --> 50:04.215
Yanzi, if you hadn't come back

50:04.423 --> 50:06.632
I would have decided that
all love is bullshit.

50:19.923 --> 50:23.382
People say that college
romances don't last.

50:24.717 --> 50:26.632
Yanzi and I are the only
couple still together...

50:26.717 --> 50:28.298
in our class.

50:28.967 --> 50:30.048
We will keep up...

50:30.548 --> 50:32.382
the good work!

50:32.465 --> 50:34.798
Bravo! Bravo!

50:41.507 --> 50:44.257
I used to think that, when
great happiness arrives

50:44.465 --> 50:46.798
I'd weep with joy.

50:47.967 --> 50:49.382
But I didn't

50:49.798 --> 50:51.173
I'm not crying.

50:51.465 --> 50:52.798
So happy!

50:54.048 --> 50:55.925
I'm so happy!
Chubby

50:56.007 --> 50:57.632
I need to talk to you.

50:59.842 --> 51:00.923
Yanzi

51:02.007 --> 51:04.092
is something wrong?

51:05.257 --> 51:07.340
Was it something I did?

51:11.007 --> 51:13.590
I never know what you're thinking

51:14.590 --> 51:15.882
but then I thought

51:16.007 --> 51:19.048
we're together now. I don't have to know.

51:21.590 --> 51:22.757
Yanzi.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.134
Yanzi.

51:37.632 --> 51:39.048
Go away.

51:39.717 --> 51:42.092
Yanzi wants to confess
her feelings for me.

51:43.215 --> 51:44.673
She's so romantic

51:48.882 --> 51:50.590
I came back...

51:51.507 --> 51:53.717
to break up with you.

51:55.967 --> 51:57.463
You've stayed abroad for so long

51:57.465 --> 51:59.340
and now you're good at
making western jokes

52:08.882 --> 52:10.632
I just can't bring myself to...

52:12.298 --> 52:14.673
break up with you over the phone

52:15.507 --> 52:18.423
I came back to say goodbye properly

52:19.423 --> 52:22.048
so we can still remain good friends.

52:23.673 --> 52:24.967
So many people...

52:25.382 --> 52:27.257
are waiting for us.

52:27.923 --> 52:30.134
Let's go finish the party

52:32.173 --> 52:34.134
then go our separate ways.

52:37.923 --> 52:38.923
Let's go.

52:41.798 --> 52:43.048
Let's go.

52:59.340 --> 53:05.548
Why do men keep desserts in the fridge?

53:07.257 --> 53:13.548
Why do men save up for a
wedding without a bride?

53:13.757 --> 53:16.757
It's in case you appear,

53:21.757 --> 53:24.507
out of the blue.

53:28.590 --> 53:29.717
We are back.

53:31.298 --> 53:37.507
Why does one whose heart has been
broken still believe in tomorrow?

53:37.507 --> 53:39.965
It's a happy occasion. Can
you pretend to be happy?

53:39.967 --> 53:45.257
Why is it, that at moments of tearful
sorrow, we still manage to smile?

53:45.632 --> 53:48.298
I put too much pressure on her.

53:49.548 --> 53:51.048
She hurt me.

53:51.590 --> 53:53.423
But she was really doing me a favor.

53:55.092 --> 53:56.092
Right?

53:56.094 --> 53:58.548
No big deal. Everyone's had breakups

53:59.465 --> 54:01.507
I was dumped as well.

54:04.298 --> 54:05.967
Why are we even talking about this?

54:06.134 --> 54:07.548
You don't understand

54:07.632 --> 54:08.757
I'm trying to help him.

54:08.757 --> 54:10.007
Whatever Yanzi needed

54:10.173 --> 54:11.923
Chubby worked so hard to give it to her.

54:12.092 --> 54:13.465
What did he do wrong?

54:13.717 --> 54:14.717
How did mutual affection...

54:15.298 --> 54:17.423
turn into unrequited love?

54:18.882 --> 54:21.007
You know what, Chubby?

54:21.967 --> 54:23.048
I think that...

54:23.757 --> 54:25.423
it was Yanzi who stole
that money back then.

54:26.798 --> 54:28.507
What the hell are you talking about!

54:29.590 --> 54:31.298
- What the hell!
- Stop it!

54:31.382 --> 54:33.173
Stop it!

54:33.967 --> 54:34.967
It was her!

54:35.298 --> 54:36.298
Stop!

54:36.300 --> 54:37.717
What!
How dare you!

54:37.717 --> 54:39.092
Stop!

54:39.257 --> 54:41.842
Say that again! Stop it!
So I said it!

54:42.923 --> 54:45.173
What are you going to do? Let him do it.

54:45.173 --> 54:46.798
Chubby, let go.

54:47.298 --> 54:48.298
Let go.

54:49.215 --> 54:50.338
I dare you to say it again.

54:50.340 --> 54:51.465
Stop.

54:53.260 --> 54:54.842
You call yourselves men?

54:55.760 --> 54:57.217
Chen Mo, you're unbelievable.

54:58.342 --> 54:59.802
So, just because Chubby
did so much for her

54:59.967 --> 55:01.802
Yanzi has to love him and marry him?

55:03.092 --> 55:04.550
Do you know...

55:04.675 --> 55:06.050
what women really want?

55:15.175 --> 55:18.092
When will you grow up to
be normal human beings?

55:18.300 --> 55:20.175
If you can't keep up

55:20.467 --> 55:22.135
then stop complaining.

55:37.092 --> 55:38.675
All that money you sent...

55:39.300 --> 55:41.925
It was 200 thousand in total.
I wrote it all down.

55:42.092 --> 55:43.967
As soon as I have it, I'll give it back.

55:44.050 --> 55:46.510
It's alright. I don't need it so badly

55:47.425 --> 55:48.967
I'm really sorry.

55:49.842 --> 55:50.925
Don't say that.

55:51.010 --> 55:52.675
It's good that we didn't get married.

55:52.802 --> 55:53.842
Otherwise,

55:53.967 --> 55:55.842
you would have been stuck with me.

55:58.425 --> 55:59.967
Well, I'm leaving.

56:00.760 --> 56:01.760
Take care.

56:01.762 --> 56:02.842
You too.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.425
Bye.

56:09.175 --> 56:10.342
Bye.

56:10.842 --> 56:12.385
Will I see you again, Yanzi?

56:12.760 --> 56:14.550
Please be happy when I do

56:14.635 --> 56:15.802
alright?

56:16.967 --> 56:18.050
Yanzi,

56:18.135 --> 56:20.675
please be happy

56:21.010 --> 56:22.175
alright?

56:22.260 --> 56:24.260
Be happy.

56:24.342 --> 56:26.175
- Let's go.
- I won't be in your world anymore.

56:26.260 --> 56:27.967
But that's okay, as long as you're happy.

56:28.050 --> 56:29.260
Yanzi!

56:30.675 --> 56:32.092
Yanzi!

56:32.635 --> 56:34.635
Yanzi, how am I supposed
to live without you?

56:34.717 --> 56:36.135
Yanzi!

56:36.925 --> 56:38.967
Yanzi!

56:41.092 --> 56:43.135
Yanzi!

56:43.425 --> 56:45.385
Yanzi!

56:52.342 --> 56:54.300
Yanzi!

56:56.842 --> 57:00.717
Yanzi, take me with you!

57:11.592 --> 57:12.675
On that night

57:13.675 --> 57:15.967
Chubby disappeared.

57:16.217 --> 57:17.802
Nobody ever saw him again.

57:18.550 --> 57:20.342
Just as Yanzi was gone from his life,

57:21.675 --> 57:24.425
he was gone...

57:24.425 --> 57:25.427
from ours.

57:26.550 --> 57:27.550
Stop!

57:27.885 --> 57:29.175
Stop that thief!

57:29.842 --> 57:31.885
Stop! Stop!

57:32.217 --> 57:34.385
Damn, he's still running!

57:34.385 --> 57:35.675
Stop that thief!

57:40.175 --> 57:41.175
Stop!

57:49.000 --> 57:50.425
Get up!

57:50.425 --> 57:51.425
Stand up!

57:51.425 --> 57:53.885
You have some balls starting
trouble on my turf!

57:55.425 --> 57:56.885
They say that Mi phones are hard to get

57:56.967 --> 57:58.717
so here I am, trying my luck.

58:11.135 --> 58:12.592
Wonderful.

58:12.802 --> 58:14.635
So many bad guys

58:14.717 --> 58:16.967
I smell a promotion.

58:37.967 --> 58:38.967
Alert! Alert!

58:38.969 --> 58:40.965
Lychee is under assault,
continuous assault

58:40.967 --> 58:43.802
on an average of 0.3 hits per second.
Go help her!

58:49.675 --> 58:51.842
Just you wait. I'll remember you

58:52.885 --> 58:56.967
I'm Lychee, Police Number 026303.

58:58.342 --> 59:00.050
You don't scare me.

59:00.385 --> 59:01.635
Stay still!

59:07.385 --> 59:08.385
Don't move!

59:08.467 --> 59:09.467
Lychee!

59:09.885 --> 59:10.967
Lychee!

59:11.635 --> 59:12.760
Lychee!

59:14.385 --> 59:15.385
Lychee!

59:17.092 --> 59:18.967
I'm here!

59:20.592 --> 59:21.592
Lychee,

59:21.592 --> 59:22.675
thank God you're alright

59:22.760 --> 59:24.010
I'm alright

59:24.385 --> 59:25.717
I can't let anything happen to you

59:33.425 --> 59:35.135
I want to marry you.

59:43.592 --> 59:44.675
Stay still!

59:49.217 --> 59:50.510
I need to propose to Lychee soon.

59:50.510 --> 59:51.550
Following Chubby's footsteps?

59:51.717 --> 59:53.175
There are things you just have to do.

59:54.385 --> 59:56.550
You have to help me. I've
never proposed before

59:56.802 --> 59:57.925
I'm terribly inexperienced

59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.092
I've never proposed either.

01:00:03.802 --> 01:00:06.010
But you planned one, no?

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.300
I solemnly pass this on to you

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:18.217
with the entire plan for
the proposal as a bonus

01:00:18.425 --> 01:00:20.050
I don't need it anyways.

01:00:22.135 --> 01:00:23.760
The handbook is covered with dust

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.885
and that woman and I have
drifted so far apart.

01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:28.425
Cao Yu is suspected of economic fraud

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:29.871
and is on the run...

01:00:30.092 --> 01:00:31.175
What's up with Miss Xiao Rong?

01:00:31.217 --> 01:00:33.217
She and Mr. Cao partnered
up for some business deal

01:00:33.217 --> 01:00:34.760
and Mr. Cao disappeared
with all the money.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760
What a pity

01:00:36.135 --> 01:00:38.802
I heard that he only left her this car.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.260
You're his partner,
so your car is impounded

01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:45.260
I heard that the bank had
applied to the court...

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.592
to freeze all her assets.

01:00:46.592 --> 01:00:47.594
Really?

01:01:49.385 --> 01:01:55.842
Is the Blue Lotus.

01:02:03.425 --> 01:02:06.050
Nobody understands why I did that

01:02:06.885 --> 01:02:07.967
and I didn't feel like explaining.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.050
Pretty soon

01:02:10.885 --> 01:02:12.385
we were on our way to Daocheng.

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.717
Attention please. Attention please.

01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:20.967
We're three meals away
from our destination.

01:02:22.175 --> 01:02:24.717
Drive safely, and please hold my hand.

01:02:25.217 --> 01:02:26.802
That's right.

01:02:26.885 --> 01:02:28.050
Turn left in 100 meters.

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.842
Slow down. Slow down.

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:31.592
You're not the only one in this car.

01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:34.342
Who's talking?

01:02:34.802 --> 01:02:36.760
It's a navigator.

01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:39.300
A nanny? Bullshit!

01:02:39.675 --> 01:02:40.802
It's a man.

01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:42.592
What a load of crap you recorded!

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.092
Not one moment of peace!

01:02:44.217 --> 01:02:45.260
Get a normal one instead.

01:02:45.675 --> 01:02:46.677
Mr. Chen Mo,

01:02:47.592 --> 01:02:49.510
why is your mother in a child seat?

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.675
She's been using it
ever since she got sick

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:54.760
I like sitting in it.

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.260
It's comfortable.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.967
Yeah, and safe too.

01:02:58.592 --> 01:02:59.635
Impossible!

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:03.135
Even if that car were new, it
would be worth only 200 thousand.

01:03:03.342 --> 01:03:05.425
Yeah, that's what I thought too

01:03:05.842 --> 01:03:08.092
but Chen Mo insisted to
the insurance staff...

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.510
that he was to pay you 500.

01:03:09.635 --> 01:03:11.342
The insurance guy didn't know what to do.

01:03:12.467 --> 01:03:13.469
Impossible.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.467
He obviously wanted to
give you some money

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.425
I heard that he mortgaged
his house for it.

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:30.635
Li, where are you? Hurry up!

01:03:31.217 --> 01:03:33.300
Do you have everything I
left with you two years ago?

01:03:34.635 --> 01:03:35.655
How's it going?

01:03:35.967 --> 01:03:36.967
All done.

01:03:36.969 --> 01:03:38.010
Mr. Chen Mo

01:03:39.092 --> 01:03:41.217
somehow I feel that something
major is happening.

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.467
Help me propose to her.

01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:46.469
Really?!

01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:52.135
Li,

01:03:52.184 --> 01:03:53.871
I am sorry
you're finally here.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.385
Put it here.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.010
Here.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.425
Mr. Chen Mo, are you psychic?

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.592
You planned everything so long ago.

01:04:10.675 --> 01:04:13.342
How did you know that Shiba was
gonna propose two years ago?

01:04:13.467 --> 01:04:14.550
Because I'm also a fortune-teller.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:15.885
You want to have your fortune told?

01:04:16.175 --> 01:04:17.177
Sure.

01:04:17.467 --> 01:04:18.510
If you don't shut up right now,

01:04:18.802 --> 01:04:20.675
you will be thrown into a ditch
with your pants on your head,

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.967
and die a horrible death.

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:28.885
Where are Mo and the others?

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.280
Doesn't matter.

01:04:30.425 --> 01:04:31.447
Doesn't matter?

01:04:31.592 --> 01:04:33.385
It's just the two of us.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.885
So where are we going?

01:04:36.135 --> 01:04:37.175
Doesn't matter.

01:05:05.092 --> 01:05:06.467
This is a church.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:09.010
A fake one.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.217
It's shaking.

01:05:16.635 --> 01:05:18.010
Did you prepare all this?

01:05:25.135 --> 01:05:26.135
Lychee.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.302
I love you.

01:05:33.342 --> 01:05:34.550
Will you...

01:05:35.342 --> 01:05:36.344
marry...

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:39.510
me?

01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:46.592
How stingy of you! A one-line proposal...

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.425
If someone says that to me

01:05:49.885 --> 01:05:51.717
I'll say "I do."

01:05:56.092 --> 01:05:57.217
Lychee

01:05:57.925 --> 01:06:00.802
I love you. I love you. I love you.

01:06:01.802 --> 01:06:03.717
Will you marry me?

01:06:09.717 --> 01:06:10.802
Yes.

01:06:23.592 --> 01:06:25.385
Mr. Chen Mo, are you crying?

01:06:25.925 --> 01:06:27.842
Only losers cry.

01:06:31.217 --> 01:06:33.925
Three. Two. One.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.342
Let go

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.342
I used to be an inventor with no dreams.

01:06:57.885 --> 01:07:00.300
Now I will become an appliance
shop owner with big plans.

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:02.550
Mo, I will give Lychee...

01:07:02.635 --> 01:07:04.061
the best life possible.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:08.181
- Chubby has brought his home cooking.
- It's Chubby!

01:07:08.188 --> 01:07:10.588
We think he wants to make the
war fugitives feel better...

01:07:10.588 --> 01:07:11.974
with food from his hometown.

01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:15.007
Better?

01:07:15.056 --> 01:07:16.514
It doesn't make anything better.

01:07:17.056 --> 01:07:19.349
Ever since I opened this
Chinese restaurant here

01:07:19.474 --> 01:07:20.974
it has never made money.

01:07:21.431 --> 01:07:22.431
But I feel that...

01:07:22.556 --> 01:07:23.639
every dish I sell here...

01:07:24.056 --> 01:07:25.264
is another achievement.

01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:28.601
That being said

01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.139
business is getting worse by the day

01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:32.181
I can't understand what
these people are thinking

01:07:32.306 --> 01:07:33.599
fighting each other every frigging day

01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:38.391
Yanzi had been there.

01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:41.889
We don't know why this
young man Chubby...

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:45.806
insists on bringing his
hometown cooking to these places

01:07:45.809 --> 01:07:46.809
or where he will go next.

01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:48.639
Because those are all Yanzi's favorites.

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:50.431
Shiba.

01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:52.931
Do you think it's worth...

01:07:53.391 --> 01:07:54.639
changing your whole life...

01:07:55.474 --> 01:07:56.494
for a woman?

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:58.474
Yes.

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:45.765
Mr. Chen Mo.

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:48.474
do you think...

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:50.930
there is a possibility that...

01:09:51.474 --> 01:09:54.390
we'll be here again?

01:09:57.849 --> 01:09:59.390
Say, one year from now

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.599
let's come back here
and look at the stars

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:04.391
shall we?

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:23.306
It's time for the show.

01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:24.600
What show?

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:26.681
Our show.

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:28.555
What?

01:10:31.931 --> 01:10:33.806
We've gone a long way already.

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.474
There's still no reception.

01:10:36.306 --> 01:10:37.431
Almost.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.390
Yeah, I have it.
Yeah?

01:10:40.681 --> 01:10:42.640
Here?
Yeah.

01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:50.555
I want to have someone like you

01:10:51.265 --> 01:10:52.849
like the gentle breeze through the hills,

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.890
like the warm sunshine in an old town,

01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:56.975
as long as it's you in the end.

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.640
So it's Xiao Rong covering for us.

01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:02.515
Shame on this unprofessional woman!

01:11:03.431 --> 01:11:04.599
She's two minutes early.

01:11:05.225 --> 01:11:06.350
This is Xiao Rong.

01:11:06.806 --> 01:11:08.350
Exactly four years ago, on this day,

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:10.975
Passing Through Your World
came into existence

01:11:12.265 --> 01:11:14.931
Neither Chen Mo nor I
were very experienced.

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.306
We thought it was time

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.350
but actually we started
two minutes too early.

01:11:19.474 --> 01:11:22.555
What? Trying to make me look bad?
Turn it off

01:11:22.555 --> 01:11:24.474
I want to share a story with you.

01:11:26.474 --> 01:11:28.306
There was a boy and a girl,

01:11:29.681 --> 01:11:32.140
and they were hosting partners
at the university radio station.

01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:35.555
It might sound incredible to you,

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:37.806
but their love...

01:11:38.599 --> 01:11:40.765
started with a bet.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.181
If the boy won,

01:11:44.515 --> 01:11:46.265
the girl would be his girlfriend.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:49.765
If the girl won,

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.806
the boy would parade the
campus with a sign...

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:54.474
that says, "I'm an idiot".

01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:01.890
In the end, the boy won,

01:12:02.306 --> 01:12:03.765
and the girl won as well.

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:05.555
But, unfortunately,

01:12:05.975 --> 01:12:08.056
their love didn't last.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:09.806
I believe that,

01:12:10.306 --> 01:12:11.724
even if one day...

01:12:11.931 --> 01:12:13.975
the whole world has lost faith,

01:12:15.469 --> 01:12:17.176
that boy and that girl...

01:12:17.427 --> 01:12:19.344
would still believe
in that bet they made.

01:12:19.469 --> 01:12:20.926
If I win,

01:12:21.051 --> 01:12:22.219
I'll marry you.

01:12:22.427 --> 01:12:23.510
If I win,

01:12:23.719 --> 01:12:25.260
you parade with a sign

01:12:25.385 --> 01:12:27.051
I'm an idiot!

01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:29.094
Four years ago,

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.301
Chen Mo, with his sincerity,

01:12:31.385 --> 01:12:33.385
soothed countless lonely hearts.

01:12:34.094 --> 01:12:35.135
Every night,

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.051
at this hour,

01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:39.969
his voice was always here,

01:12:40.802 --> 01:12:42.176
right by your side.

01:12:43.677 --> 01:12:44.885
But one day, he changed.

01:12:46.176 --> 01:12:47.385
He lost that touch of warmth

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:50.076
I had often wondered...

01:12:50.301 --> 01:12:52.552
what made him change like that.

01:12:53.094 --> 01:12:54.635
That's public slander.

01:12:55.469 --> 01:12:57.051
It's like pouring acid on my face.

01:12:57.552 --> 01:12:59.176
Call in. Stop her.

01:12:59.594 --> 01:13:00.885
For us who sit here

01:13:02.802 --> 01:13:04.344
it's only when we are filled with love...

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.885
that our show passes on love.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.635
When we feel lonely

01:13:13.802 --> 01:13:15.510
we can't warm anybody up.

01:13:18.969 --> 01:13:22.009
Chen Mo used to be able to
cheer up so many lonely souls

01:13:24.802 --> 01:13:25.802
but now,

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:29.094
he is lonelier than anybody else.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.969
It's the station.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.885
We have a caller.

01:13:57.885 --> 01:13:58.926
Hello.

01:14:00.802 --> 01:14:02.094
Hello.

01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:51.969
Does she honestly think that...

01:14:53.385 --> 01:14:54.844
she could get to me with that?

01:14:56.385 --> 01:14:58.719
That I will shed my tears over this?

01:14:59.427 --> 01:15:01.344
No way!

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:07.135
Hey,

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.260
why are YOU crying?

01:15:11.926 --> 01:15:13.260
None of your business

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.260
I'm crying for myself.

01:15:21.802 --> 01:15:22.969
What is this?

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:24.511
Hey!

01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:29.885
Women are so incomprehensible.

01:15:31.969 --> 01:15:33.385
What's wrong with you?

01:15:33.969 --> 01:15:35.427
What are you angry for?

01:15:36.094 --> 01:15:38.885
Hey! If you don't stop, I'm leaving.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.585
Do you have any idea...

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:51.135
how many people got through
their problems because of you?

01:15:51.427 --> 01:15:53.677
Why can't you get through yours?

01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:55.719
So you were dumped. Big deal!

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:58.760
Do you have to drag
everyone down with you?

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:02.427
You're selfish. You're weak!

01:16:07.677 --> 01:16:08.677
Hey,

01:16:09.009 --> 01:16:10.427
I'm sorry, alright?

01:16:10.552 --> 01:16:11.719
My dear lady,

01:16:11.969 --> 01:16:13.051
I need to warn you.

01:16:13.552 --> 01:16:15.594
There are wolves here.

01:16:44.885 --> 01:16:45.886
Wolf!

01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:47.059
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.969
Birdie, Birdie, you are so beautiful.

01:16:49.719 --> 01:16:50.802
Mo.

01:16:50.804 --> 01:16:51.804
Yeah?

01:16:51.805 --> 01:16:53.604
As your friend, I'll help you to...

01:16:53.605 --> 01:16:55.677
marry Xiao Rong, so you
can beat her up everyday.

01:16:59.405 --> 01:17:04.271
On your journey for the new day,
this is Ji Nan Music 88.7.

01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:05.520
Good morning I am your DJ Mai Mai...

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.932
Thank you for listening to
music station FM 98.6.

01:17:09.932 --> 01:17:11.314
I am your DJ Rocking Shu Han.

01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:14.774
It's now 6 p.m. in the evening.

01:17:14.774 --> 01:17:18.520
You are listening to Chung King FM 90.2.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.319
Don't go away...
We have more exciting programs coming up.

01:17:34.552 --> 01:17:36.219
Shiba.

01:17:37.344 --> 01:17:38.760
Shiba.

01:17:41.344 --> 01:17:42.594
What are you working on?

01:17:43.469 --> 01:17:44.469
A secret.

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:46.219
A secret?

01:17:46.594 --> 01:17:49.176
How dare you keep a secret on my turf!

01:17:49.219 --> 01:17:50.219
I promise that...

01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:51.802
someday, you will know what it is,

01:17:52.344 --> 01:17:54.926
and you will be very happy.

01:17:57.094 --> 01:17:58.385
That's not called a "secret."

01:17:58.427 --> 01:18:00.719
That's a surprise, you fool.

01:18:04.176 --> 01:18:05.760
I'm gonna go help out Birdie.

01:18:05.844 --> 01:18:08.385
Be careful on your patrol tonight.

01:18:09.594 --> 01:18:10.594
Don't worry.

01:18:10.677 --> 01:18:12.301
I have you to protect me.

01:18:35.385 --> 01:18:38.301
Three years ago, I came to this city

01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:40.760
I was alone, and I felt lonely.

01:18:45.594 --> 01:18:47.926
Shiba, how's it going? Is it ready?

01:18:48.219 --> 01:18:49.469
Trust me.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:53.594
Hello?

01:18:53.594 --> 01:18:56.009
Miss Xiao Rong, can you
come up to the roof?

01:19:10.094 --> 01:19:12.469
Shiba, Xiao Rong is here.

01:19:13.469 --> 01:19:14.469
Ready?

01:19:14.594 --> 01:19:15.594
Three.

01:19:15.802 --> 01:19:16.804
Two.

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:18.052
One.

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.427
Please, God, make it work.

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:28.009
How I wish to have someone like you.

01:19:28.385 --> 01:19:33.344
But dusk is that different from dawn.

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:37.969
The rain stops, the song stops,
and the wind blows on.

01:19:38.385 --> 01:19:43.301
That umbrella was left at the same place.

01:19:43.926 --> 01:19:48.176
How I wish you were the one.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:53.885
But time passes and youth is long gone.

01:19:54.176 --> 01:19:58.677
A light, a city, searching
for that one person.

01:19:58.885 --> 01:20:03.219
It's been quite a journey

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:11.219
I have passed through your world.

01:20:11.385 --> 01:20:16.344
Left the best and all of me there.

01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:21.427
Please walk on and no need to turn around

01:20:21.635 --> 01:20:28.760
I'll be waiting for you
at the end of the road.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:35.761
Mrs. Chen

01:20:36.094 --> 01:20:37.677
I won't be around anymore.

01:20:38.094 --> 01:20:39.677
Take good care of yourself.

01:20:49.969 --> 01:20:51.094
For you

01:20:51.427 --> 01:20:52.677
love is enough.

01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:55.594
But for me

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:58.094
being right for each other
is more important

01:21:01.176 --> 01:21:02.844
I devoted my youth to love

01:21:03.677 --> 01:21:05.635
but I don't have another youth.

01:21:07.802 --> 01:21:09.760
Standing at the crossroads

01:21:10.219 --> 01:21:11.719
I told myself that

01:21:12.219 --> 01:21:14.844
if I don't go now, I will never do it

01:21:18.969 --> 01:21:21.176
I want to see what it's
like in a higher place.

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:24.844
Even if it means having a hard time now

01:21:25.677 --> 01:21:27.051
that is the life I've chosen

01:21:33.176 --> 01:21:35.344
I want to give this card back to you.

01:21:35.926 --> 01:21:38.301
Keep it. We are the best of friends.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.094
Once I give it back to you

01:21:40.385 --> 01:21:42.135
we can start to be the best of friends.

01:21:50.885 --> 01:21:52.094
Thanks.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.301
Someone told me that

01:21:58.969 --> 01:22:00.677
once you fall for someone

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.594
you won't see anything but that person.

01:22:06.926 --> 01:22:08.594
Even when you're in pain

01:22:09.427 --> 01:22:11.094
you keep telling yourself

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:12.677
Hold on.

01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:15.802
Don't you die like this.

01:22:17.176 --> 01:22:18.677
And you thought she was...

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:20.301
talking about you?

01:22:20.301 --> 01:22:21.302
No.

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.802
I know now...

01:22:26.427 --> 01:22:28.219
that she was talking about herself.

01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:53.967
Sorry, the number you are calling
can not be reached at the moment.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.677
Please try again later.

01:23:30.301 --> 01:23:32.176
Who have you passed by today,

01:23:32.301 --> 01:23:34.051
and who has lost you?

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.552
Welcome to Passing Through Your World.

01:23:36.677 --> 01:23:37.926
This is Chen Mo.

01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:39.760
Tonight,

01:23:44.344 --> 01:23:45.844
Birdie is not here

01:23:47.802 --> 01:23:49.760
So, instead of taking calls

01:23:50.176 --> 01:23:52.051
let me tell you a story.

01:23:55.385 --> 01:23:56.844
There is a girl...

01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:59.176
who's always a bit scared.

01:23:59.885 --> 01:24:02.260
Although she's been living
here for a few years now

01:24:03.469 --> 01:24:05.135
she doesn't have many friends.

01:24:05.885 --> 01:24:07.301
She feels lonely.

01:24:09.019 --> 01:24:11.768
Three years ago, I came to this city

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.060
I was alone, and I felt lonely

01:24:14.225 --> 01:24:15.935
I was scared of doing anything

01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:18.269
so I never went out.

01:24:19.019 --> 01:24:20.225
Every night,

01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:22.269
I can only fall asleep...

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:23.643
once I listen to
Passing Through Your World.

01:24:24.435 --> 01:24:26.560
I grew attached to the voice of the host.

01:24:27.144 --> 01:24:28.850
He was always there at the same hour...

01:24:28.975 --> 01:24:30.350
to bring me comfort and joy.

01:24:31.725 --> 01:24:33.850
At the convenience store where I worked

01:24:34.144 --> 01:24:35.600
there was this wall.

01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:38.060
People came to draw pictures on it

01:24:39.225 --> 01:24:41.725
I also drew something there...

01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:43.935
an image of my dream life.

01:24:57.768 --> 01:25:00.144
One rainy day

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.350
a guy waited there for the rain to stop.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.810
Later, I realized he
had drawn something too.

01:25:26.393 --> 01:25:31.144
He had put an umbrella into
the little girl's hand.

01:25:33.144 --> 01:25:37.393
How I wished that my life would
be just like the drawing,

01:25:37.894 --> 01:25:39.269
better every day,

01:25:39.894 --> 01:25:41.475
filled with happiness.

01:25:43.725 --> 01:25:45.810
Then one day, I learned that...

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.518
the guy was actually
the host of that show.

01:25:49.935 --> 01:25:51.296
His name is Chen Mo.

01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:53.225
Mr. Chen Mo

01:25:54.225 --> 01:25:55.810
it's my birthday today.

01:25:57.475 --> 01:25:58.497
Happy birthday.

01:25:59.144 --> 01:26:00.560
But I'm spending it alone

01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:02.643
I understand how you feel.

01:26:02.935 --> 01:26:05.350
At this moment, around the world,

01:26:05.975 --> 01:26:07.801
many people are celebrating
their birthdays,

01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:08.975
so you're not really alone.

01:26:09.185 --> 01:26:11.768
It's okay. I'm here for you

01:26:12.643 --> 01:26:13.810
I feel so lonely.

01:26:14.768 --> 01:26:16.475
If it weren't for your show

01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:19.144
I might have given up.

01:26:19.518 --> 01:26:21.894
There is this place, called Daocheng

01:26:22.894 --> 01:26:24.350
I want to go there...

01:26:24.725 --> 01:26:25.935
with my sweetheart

01:26:26.518 --> 01:26:28.100
to see the crystal blue sky

01:26:28.935 --> 01:26:30.475
the snowy mountains

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.144
the golden meadows

01:26:33.725 --> 01:26:36.019
to experience an autumn fairy tale.

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:37.810
Let's break up.

01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:39.310
What?

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:41.100
You're a great DJ,

01:26:41.393 --> 01:26:42.894
but not a good lover.

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.350
From that day on,

01:26:44.725 --> 01:26:46.643
he was like a different person

01:26:47.185 --> 01:26:48.185
I think that,

01:26:48.475 --> 01:26:50.426
if I hadn't made that call,

01:26:50.435 --> 01:26:52.100
things wouldn't have ended up like this.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.435
But I don't know how I
can make it better.

01:26:57.393 --> 01:26:59.269
Passing Through Your World.

01:27:06.685 --> 01:27:09.475
That's the reason you want to work here?

01:27:11.725 --> 01:27:13.475
I want to be closer to him.

01:27:15.144 --> 01:27:16.269
It's funny in a way.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.019
Every day, I talk to myself
over the microphone,

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.600
giving answers to other people's lives.

01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.475
But my life is a bigger
mess than anyone else's

01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:29.435
I have no idea how many
of you in this town...

01:27:29.643 --> 01:27:31.435
are listening to my babbling,

01:27:32.269 --> 01:27:34.019
but if you'd be so kind as to oblige me,

01:27:34.768 --> 01:27:36.435
I'd like you to flash your signal lights,

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.975
even if it's just one person

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.725
one car

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:42.393
one light

01:27:43.144 --> 01:27:44.850
I just want Birdie to know that...

01:27:46.475 --> 01:27:47.894
I'm looking for her.

01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:57.643
It's understandable, really

01:27:59.518 --> 01:28:01.435
I'd given up on myself so long ago

01:28:04.975 --> 01:28:07.100
so it's only fair that you
guys gave up on me too.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.269
You always say you're not pretty

01:30:29.393 --> 01:30:30.600
not brave

01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:32.435
with all kinds of imperfections.

01:30:32.768 --> 01:30:34.350
Well, you're right

01:30:34.643 --> 01:30:35.810
but so what?

01:30:37.185 --> 01:30:38.850
You are Birdie

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:41.393
the smallest tile of the Mahjong set

01:30:42.225 --> 01:30:44.060
but without you

01:30:45.144 --> 01:30:47.185
there won't be a hand
of Thirteen Orphans.

01:31:03.935 --> 01:31:07.894
Thank you for letting me
pass through your world.

01:31:15.518 --> 01:31:18.725
After that day,
I never heard from Birdie again.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.475
Lives often change overnight

01:31:23.019 --> 01:31:26.418
and that night was far from over.

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:16.949
You're a feisty one, aren't you?

01:32:17.074 --> 01:32:18.324
I'm not running today

01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:19.533
and neither are you.

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.471
Lychee, I'm here!

01:32:36.015 --> 01:32:37.971
I called the police. I called the police!

01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.220
I am the police, silly.

01:32:40.264 --> 01:32:41.846
Honey, it's just a few petty thieves

01:32:41.971 --> 01:32:43.471
I can finish them off in no time.

01:32:55.890 --> 01:32:57.055
Shiba!

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:02.139
Honey, you okay?

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:03.721
It's alright. Hold on

01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:05.846
I'm arresting all of them.

01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:31.430
Go. Go. Go.

01:33:31.431 --> 01:33:33.596
Stop. Stop right there.

01:33:34.055 --> 01:33:35.555
Stop. Stop.

01:33:37.555 --> 01:33:38.596
Wait for me.

01:33:46.015 --> 01:33:47.346
Don't worry

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:49.930
I'll be back safe and sound.

01:33:51.264 --> 01:33:52.890
What are you doing, Shiba?

01:35:07.389 --> 01:35:10.180
I've cried enough.
I don't want to cry anymore.

01:35:19.846 --> 01:35:20.971
Lychee

01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:23.139
you always look at the sky while walking,

01:35:23.346 --> 01:35:24.930
and you have a terrible
sense of direction.

01:35:25.305 --> 01:35:26.890
You say you don't want to travel far

01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:28.471
in case you can't get back.

01:35:28.971 --> 01:35:30.305
You don't need to worry anymore.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.555
No need to remember all the
street names, no need to buy maps

01:35:33.765 --> 01:35:35.555
I'll be here in this navigator

01:35:36.015 --> 01:35:37.220
always by your side.

01:35:38.055 --> 01:35:39.805
As long as the sun rises,

01:35:40.305 --> 01:35:42.596
the navigator will always be charged

01:35:44.096 --> 01:35:45.099
and I...

01:35:45.514 --> 01:35:47.389
will always be there by your side.

01:36:01.765 --> 01:36:04.264
I've heard a lot of honest
confessions in my life.

01:36:05.514 --> 01:36:06.846
I feel lucky

01:36:08.139 --> 01:36:09.890
for I have been confided in

01:36:11.139 --> 01:36:12.555
but I'm also sad,

01:36:13.264 --> 01:36:14.930
because I can't get over them.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.264
Memories are like a city made of sand.

01:36:20.015 --> 01:36:21.596
You can't touch it.

01:36:22.096 --> 01:36:23.765
As soon as your hands fall on it,

01:36:24.096 --> 01:36:26.721
the entire city will
collapse with a rumble.

01:36:27.596 --> 01:36:29.180
And our tears roll down...

01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.721
and we keep looking back

01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:32.555
but we can only move on.

01:36:38.932 --> 01:36:44.220
[350 days later]
[Xiang Cheng]

01:36:45.264 --> 01:36:46.974
- Say "Daddy".
- Daddy.

01:36:47.264 --> 01:36:48.265
Louder.

01:36:48.265 --> 01:36:49.930
Daddy.
Louder.

01:36:49.965 --> 01:36:51.389
Chen Mo, you're taking
advantage of me again.

01:36:51.555 --> 01:36:53.765
You're the one who left
your son here unattended.

01:36:54.055 --> 01:36:55.430
Daddy's leaving. Bye.

01:36:55.765 --> 01:36:56.765
Let's go home.

01:36:57.372 --> 01:36:58.389
Bye.

01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:59.390
Bye.

01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.702
Chen Mo, you...

01:37:02.715 --> 01:37:04.096
So, your purchasing cost is three yuan.

01:37:04.765 --> 01:37:05.846
You sell it for five.

01:37:06.096 --> 01:37:07.389
Someone gives you a ten.

01:37:07.596 --> 01:37:08.721
You don't have enough change

01:37:08.765 --> 01:37:09.971
so you borrow from your neighbor.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.971
Later you find that the ten is a fake.

01:37:12.721 --> 01:37:14.139
Fake money is no good.

01:37:14.765 --> 01:37:16.015
This chunk of meat here

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.180
I'll give you two yuan for it.

01:37:18.664 --> 01:37:20.015
- Wrap it up.
- Two yuan.

01:37:20.055 --> 01:37:21.056
Yes.

01:37:21.471 --> 01:37:22.474
Lao Chen!

01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.180
Woah!

01:37:25.664 --> 01:37:26.846
More than half a kilo.

01:37:26.971 --> 01:37:28.139
With 36 yuan per kilo...

01:37:28.721 --> 01:37:29.805
I'll give you a discount. Twenty.

01:37:29.805 --> 01:37:31.930
Twenty? Go to hell.

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:33.305
- You already get a discount.
- I don't want it anymore.

01:37:33.305 --> 01:37:34.596
I thought you like them cheap.

01:37:34.846 --> 01:37:35.846
Hey, it's a big discount.

01:37:35.846 --> 01:37:38.430
- I'll save the 20 for my future wife.
- Mo, you're off work?

01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:39.430
Yeah.

01:37:39.514 --> 01:37:41.534
Listen to me. If you see
Lao Chen again, ignore him.

01:37:41.534 --> 01:37:43.555
Don't talk to him. Got it?

01:37:43.555 --> 01:37:44.555
Yeah.

01:37:44.805 --> 01:37:45.805
Mo,

01:37:46.015 --> 01:37:47.015
it's a gift.

01:37:47.064 --> 01:37:48.930
- I can't take it.
- It's a gift.

01:37:48.931 --> 01:37:50.029
I'll take it then.

01:37:50.032 --> 01:37:51.139
Take it.

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:57.471
It's the 358th day that I've been here.

01:37:58.930 --> 01:38:01.305
But the spot beside me is still empty

01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:03.721
I'm waiting for her.

01:38:24.113 --> 01:38:25.113
Hello!

01:38:26.404 --> 01:38:27.404
Hello!

01:38:27.654 --> 01:38:28.695
Hello!

01:38:30.154 --> 01:38:33.988
August, the season of osmanthus.

01:38:35.154 --> 01:38:38.654
Entertainment news, with all the gossip.

01:38:38.695 --> 01:38:40.738
I, Chen Mo, am here to deliver for you...

01:38:40.819 --> 01:38:43.238
all the latest and
hottest celebrity news.

01:38:43.404 --> 01:38:47.945
Speaking of Rose, top dancer
at the Qingqing Dancehall

01:38:48.154 --> 01:38:50.779
I bet you'd think of words like...

01:38:52.113 --> 01:38:54.445
"sexy" and "rebellious."

01:38:55.113 --> 01:38:58.445
But according to the
paparazzi Granny Liu

01:38:58.529 --> 01:39:02.070
Rose has decided to marry Mr. Liu,
the accountant at the steel bar factory.

01:39:02.195 --> 01:39:04.988
Who would have thought, huh?

01:39:05.279 --> 01:39:07.363
Chen Mo. Chen Mo. Chen Mo.

01:39:07.399 --> 01:39:08.399
What is it, Mrs. Zhao?

01:39:08.404 --> 01:39:09.613
I lost a sheep.

01:39:09.613 --> 01:39:10.614
Lost a sheep?

01:39:10.614 --> 01:39:11.819
Please help me find it.

01:39:11.988 --> 01:39:13.488
Emergency notice!

01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:16.113
- Mrs. Zhao's sheep went missing.
- Male or female?

01:39:16.113 --> 01:39:17.820
Female.
It's an ewe.

01:39:17.863 --> 01:39:18.988
Where did you lose it?

01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:21.573
It's an ewe

01:39:22.363 --> 01:39:23.819
with a dark patch on its butt.

01:39:23.945 --> 01:39:24.988
She had three lambs already.

01:39:25.863 --> 01:39:27.488
What misfortune!

01:39:27.904 --> 01:39:30.654
I tied her at the edge of the field.

01:39:30.863 --> 01:39:32.738
Which idiot took her by mistake?

01:39:32.863 --> 01:39:34.404
Was it you?

01:39:36.363 --> 01:39:38.684
- It's smoking.
- I'm aware.

01:39:38.695 --> 01:39:40.029
Does it still work?

01:39:40.113 --> 01:39:41.154
What do you think?

01:39:41.988 --> 01:39:43.404
Chen Mo, help me please.

01:39:43.488 --> 01:39:44.613
I will. I will.

01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:47.363
Hello. Hello, everyone.

01:39:47.445 --> 01:39:48.819
We have an urgent request.

01:39:48.831 --> 01:39:50.029
Mrs. Zhao has lost her sheep.

01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:51.570
Is there a reward, Mrs. Zhao?

01:39:51.654 --> 01:39:53.988
Reward my ass. She said "reward her ass."

01:39:54.945 --> 01:39:56.404
Chen Mo, big disaster!

01:39:56.529 --> 01:39:58.904
The butcher went crazy. Come on!

01:39:59.113 --> 01:40:01.279
Hey, my sheep!

01:40:01.363 --> 01:40:03.779
I don't want to talk to you.
You just had to make me!

01:40:03.863 --> 01:40:05.613
I won't talk to you anymore!
You take advantage of me!

01:40:05.695 --> 01:40:07.238
Here's your money. Here's your money.

01:40:07.445 --> 01:40:08.445
You take advantage of me everyday.

01:40:08.613 --> 01:40:10.279
Silly!

01:40:10.529 --> 01:40:11.529
Silly!

01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:13.363
Silly!

01:40:16.445 --> 01:40:17.466
It's his fault.

01:40:19.238 --> 01:40:20.259
It's his fault.

01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:22.551
It's his fault.

01:40:23.195 --> 01:40:26.238
He comes to take advantage
of me every day, every day.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:30.279
He tricks me every day.
He takes advantage of me.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.819
He takes advantage of me every day.

01:40:40.863 --> 01:40:41.863
Take him.

01:40:42.154 --> 01:40:44.238
I'm not going. I'm not going.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.695
I'm not going. I'm not going.

01:40:46.779 --> 01:40:48.695
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

01:40:48.819 --> 01:40:49.820
Take him.

01:40:50.195 --> 01:40:51.445
Leave me alone.

01:40:51.529 --> 01:40:53.070
That Lao Chen is not a decent fellow

01:40:53.154 --> 01:40:55.695
always taking advantage
of the gullible...

01:40:56.113 --> 01:40:57.363
I can't change the life of others

01:40:58.654 --> 01:41:00.863
because I'm not even sure
where to go myself.

01:41:01.904 --> 01:41:03.029
Before, I would have given up

01:41:03.613 --> 01:41:04.695
but now, I've decided...

01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:06.695
to go on.

01:41:12.654 --> 01:41:14.779
Mom, what's the occasion?

01:41:14.779 --> 01:41:17.180
There's so much food.

01:41:17.195 --> 01:41:18.488
I'm waiting for my son.

01:41:19.529 --> 01:41:20.944
Well, here I am.

01:41:20.945 --> 01:41:23.613
I have three sons,
and three daughters-in-law.

01:41:26.863 --> 01:41:28.444
We don't need to wait for them.

01:41:28.445 --> 01:41:29.819
They're busy.

01:41:30.029 --> 01:41:31.945
Put that down. We have to wait.

01:41:32.029 --> 01:41:33.738
When will they be home?

01:41:37.695 --> 01:41:38.698
Soon.

01:41:40.195 --> 01:41:42.529
Soon. Soon.

01:41:43.238 --> 01:41:46.029
We have to wait. We have to wait.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.819
There are people who will
never show up again.

01:41:57.819 --> 01:41:59.945
Everyone has their own path to follow

01:42:00.904 --> 01:42:02.195
I know where I'm going.

01:42:04.404 --> 01:42:05.695
If you're just passing through

01:42:06.404 --> 01:42:07.904
I'll be waiting for you at
the end of the journey.

01:42:08.529 --> 01:42:09.654
This is Chen Mo.

01:42:11.819 --> 01:42:12.820
Goodbye.

01:42:19.630 --> 01:42:21.488
I haven't been powered on
for a long time.

01:42:21.613 --> 01:42:22.694
Where to? Where to?

01:42:22.695 --> 01:42:24.154
Attention please. Attention please.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.113
For the next 100 meters,
there is nothing

01:42:28.195 --> 01:42:29.695
and this part of the road is very bumpy

01:42:29.779 --> 01:42:30.945
I suggest getting off the
pushing the car forward.

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.363
If you can't move it, cry for help.

01:42:34.279 --> 01:42:35.570
It probably won't be of much use

01:42:35.988 --> 01:42:37.695
but yelling, at least,
can make you feel better.

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.863
Lychee, are you in Daocheng again?

01:42:50.195 --> 01:42:51.779
Your position is at Chonggu Temple

01:42:52.363 --> 01:42:54.070
where I proposed to you.

01:42:54.445 --> 01:42:56.070
When we get here

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:57.988
I would tell you that...

01:42:58.738 --> 01:43:00.320
the crystal blue sky...

01:43:00.654 --> 01:43:01.676
makes you...

01:43:01.945 --> 01:43:03.029
the most beautiful angel.

01:43:04.154 --> 01:43:05.238
Lychee

01:43:05.613 --> 01:43:06.819
I'm wondering

01:43:07.613 --> 01:43:09.488
when you hear this

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:12.154
is it our one-year anniversary?

01:43:12.904 --> 01:43:14.363
or maybe a road trip

01:43:14.863 --> 01:43:15.988
traveling with our baby?

01:43:17.445 --> 01:43:19.529
Both the me that was standing
under the sky on that day

01:43:20.029 --> 01:43:21.613
and the me today

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:23.695
we want to tell you that secret

01:43:24.113 --> 01:43:25.863
I want the whole world to know:

01:43:26.154 --> 01:43:27.154
Lychee

01:43:27.404 --> 01:43:28.654
I love you.

01:43:29.695 --> 01:43:33.404
Lychee, I love you.
I will always love you.

01:43:34.363 --> 01:43:38.070
Lychee, I love you.
I will always love you.

01:43:38.988 --> 01:43:43.154
Lychee, I love you.
I will always love you.

01:43:45.195 --> 01:43:48.570
Lychee, I love you.
I will always love you.

01:43:52.819 --> 01:43:56.613
Lychee, I love you.
I will always love you.

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:02.654
Lychee, I love you.
I will always love you.

01:44:09.819 --> 01:44:10.945
Lychee

01:44:11.613 --> 01:44:14.863
I love you. I love you. I love you.

01:44:15.113 --> 01:44:17.238
Will you marry me?

01:44:18.279 --> 01:44:19.279
Yes.

01:44:25.945 --> 01:44:28.363
I want to have someone like you

01:44:28.904 --> 01:44:30.863
like the gentle breeze through the hills

01:44:31.404 --> 01:44:33.363
like the warm sunshine in an old town.

01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:35.819
From dawn till nightfall

01:44:36.279 --> 01:44:38.238
from the fields to the study

01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:40.529
nothing matters

01:44:41.779 --> 01:44:43.445
as long as it's you in the end.

01:44:51.113 --> 01:44:52.113
In one's life

01:44:52.819 --> 01:44:54.279
there always comes someone...

01:44:55.529 --> 01:44:56.904
who nods in promise...

01:44:57.029 --> 01:44:58.363
to share the future with you

01:44:58.904 --> 01:44:59.993
one milestone...

01:45:00.654 --> 01:45:02.279
at a time.
