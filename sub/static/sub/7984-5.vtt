The Ellcrys seed must be carried

00:05.828 --> 00:07.995
Do you remember the summer you
sent us to the fort in Drey Wood?

00:08.031 --> 00:09.113
We met an Elf there named Rin Katsin.

00:09.198 --> 00:10.414
Send word to Drey Wood.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.667
I want Rin Katsin brought
there immediately.

00:12.702 --> 00:13.951
Don't touch me.

00:14.037 --> 00:15.369
Something happen when people touch you?

00:15.421 --> 00:16.871
He's a seer.

00:16.923 --> 00:18.089
(groans)

00:18.174 --> 00:19.874
- You killed him.
- It wasn't the Princess.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.509
It was a Changeling.

00:21.544 --> 00:24.045
It can inhabit the form
of any being it chooses.

00:24.130 --> 00:26.013
(groaning)

00:27.266 --> 00:28.766
You need to start trusting the Ellcrys.

00:29.187 --> 00:31.515
Otherwise the three of you
will not make it to Safehold.

00:31.609 --> 00:33.192
(roaring)

00:35.813 --> 00:38.113
Move out!

Come on, that's not fair.

01:04.914 --> 01:06.948
You cheated.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.166
Amberle, what is it?

01:09.252 --> 01:11.002
What's wrong?

01:11.087 --> 01:12.036
Nothing.

01:12.121 --> 01:13.170
I just got a leg cramp

01:13.256 --> 01:14.956
from kicking your butt so hard.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.291
(chuckles) Yeah. I let you win.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.510
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

01:19.596 --> 01:22.964
Last one back to the palace
has to walk Manx for a month.

01:56.332 --> 01:58.883
Diana, this is our last
chance to be together.

01:58.968 --> 02:00.551
For a month.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.003
- You'll live.
- (chuckles)

02:02.088 --> 02:03.421
Yeah, but when I get back,

02:03.506 --> 02:05.306
I'll be a diplomat and
you'll be a Captain.

02:05.341 --> 02:06.674
We won't have time to fool around.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.643
Regular power couple, huh?

02:08.678 --> 02:09.894
Mm-hmm.

(Aine) Amberle.

04:23.479 --> 04:26.030
You're excused, Lorin.

04:27.483 --> 04:28.949
(man) How many times have I...

04:28.985 --> 04:30.734
I hope you have a good explanation

04:30.820 --> 04:33.404
- for being out of bed at this hour.
- I'm sorry, Father.

04:33.489 --> 04:35.823
An apology is not an explanation.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.792
What were you doing in the Sanctuary?

04:37.827 --> 04:39.326
It was just a dumb dare.

04:39.378 --> 04:42.797
I wanted to see if I could
beat Lorin to the Ellcrys.

04:46.169 --> 04:48.886
Tell me you ran circles
around that little show-off.

04:48.971 --> 04:50.221
(both chuckling)

04:50.306 --> 04:51.422

04:51.507 --> 04:52.756
(chuckles) That's my girl.

04:52.842 --> 04:55.843
I bet he insisted he let you win too.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.895
Men are a predictable bunch.

04:57.980 --> 05:00.981
Even when we lie, we lack imagination.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.521
When you were a Chosen,

05:07.573 --> 05:09.406
did the Ellcrys ever speak to you?

05:09.492 --> 05:12.693
Speak? No.

05:12.778 --> 05:14.862
Maybe it only speaks to girls.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.080
Perhaps.

05:16.165 --> 05:19.333
Of course, there's never
been any female Chosen.

05:19.368 --> 05:22.086
But there's no law that says a
woman can't run the Gauntlet.

05:22.171 --> 05:26.090
Maybe when you're older, you'll
show those boys a thing or two.

05:29.762 --> 05:30.928
Amberle?

05:32.882 --> 05:34.715
Go to your room and lock the door.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.383
- Understand?
- Uh-huh.

05:36.435 --> 05:37.768
Go.

05:39.355 --> 05:40.521
(sword clangs)

05:40.556 --> 05:43.190
- Boy. Good boy. Come on.
- (growls)

05:43.226 --> 05:44.892
Good.

05:46.395 --> 05:48.863
You're late, Ander.

05:48.898 --> 05:50.197
(groans)

05:53.402 --> 05:57.037
I'm afraid the young Prince
is occupied this evening.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.292
(Eventine) Ah.

06:01.377 --> 06:02.793
Slanter, isn't it?

06:02.879 --> 06:06.046
Self-appointed leader
of the Gnome rebellion.

06:06.082 --> 06:08.215
Your reputation precedes you.

06:08.251 --> 06:09.750
I fight for freedom,

06:09.835 --> 06:11.802
not vanity, unlike you.

06:11.888 --> 06:13.170
You'll forgive me, but I...

06:13.256 --> 06:15.589
I don't respond to that
sort of diplomacy.

06:15.641 --> 06:19.426
The time for diplomacy has passed.

06:19.478 --> 06:20.928
Now is the time for vengeance!

06:20.980 --> 06:23.898
If you truly care about your people,

06:23.933 --> 06:26.483
lay down your weapons.

06:26.569 --> 06:28.569
Help me end this war.

06:28.604 --> 06:30.771
We will spare your life.

06:34.410 --> 06:35.943
You have our word.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.613
Enough words.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.165
(grunting)

06:44.954 --> 06:46.754
(groans)

06:59.302 --> 07:00.935
(groans)

07:07.476 --> 07:08.809
Aah!

07:13.449 --> 07:15.566
- No!
- Aah!

07:15.651 --> 07:18.402
Your majesty.

07:18.487 --> 07:21.205
(grunting)

07:25.745 --> 07:28.128
(Amberle) No! Father!

07:30.916 --> 07:33.481
It's all right. It's all right.

07:45.514 --> 07:47.314
(Amberle) Father!

08:04.700 --> 08:07.001
How much further 'til we meet Rin Katsin?

08:07.036 --> 08:08.452
A day's ride, maybe more.

08:08.537 --> 08:09.787
We'd make better time

08:09.872 --> 08:11.121
if we weren't carrying
so much dead weight.

08:11.207 --> 08:12.623
(whimpers)

08:12.708 --> 08:14.875
(breathing heavily)

08:21.384 --> 08:23.851
I think it's marsh-wolf.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.220
It's a little gamey, but
it beats ferns and dirt.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.772
Being pulled around in
chains killed my appetite.

08:28.858 --> 08:30.057
Maybe if you dropped the whole

08:30.109 --> 08:31.859
lying, cheating, and stealing act,

08:31.894 --> 08:34.361
you'd find people were a
little more hospitable.

08:34.397 --> 08:35.895
Thanks for the advice.

08:37.817 --> 08:41.402
I'll talk to Amberle. Maybe
we can switch to rope.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.736
Whatever her Royal
Highness commands, right?

08:53.582 --> 08:56.166
We need to unchain her.

08:56.252 --> 08:58.252
She's not gonna help
us find the Bloodfire

08:58.337 --> 09:00.254
if we keep her dragged
along like a prisoner.

09:00.339 --> 09:01.755
You sure you don't want her hands free

09:01.841 --> 09:03.640
for some other reason?

09:03.726 --> 09:05.392
We can make camp inside the
tree line before nightfall.

09:05.428 --> 09:07.428
Wouldn't the valley offer
better visibility?

09:07.513 --> 09:10.597
- If the Demons attack...
- My men will handle them.

09:10.683 --> 09:14.101
She's right. You haven't seen
what these things are capable of.

09:14.186 --> 09:17.271
Your cowardice is noted, boy.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.606
But the valley would add
a half day to our trip,

09:19.658 --> 09:21.658
time we can't spare.

09:24.663 --> 09:26.246
The forest it is.

09:31.954 --> 09:33.620
(Crispin) Move out!

_

10:23.339 --> 10:25.973
(moaning)

10:29.999 --> 10:33.417
(Crispin) This is the last stop for
water before we get to the fort.

10:39.592 --> 10:41.092
Whoa.

10:41.177 --> 10:42.793
Guards, spread out.

10:42.879 --> 10:44.712
(man) Clear.

10:44.764 --> 10:47.515
(Crispin) Check the perimeters.
Keep your eyes open.

10:50.770 --> 10:52.052
Yes, sir.

10:53.639 --> 10:55.723
(whimpering)

10:55.808 --> 10:57.191
Cozy place.

10:59.395 --> 11:01.946
I'm just saying, I think you were
right about camping in the open.

11:02.031 --> 11:03.583
Maybe we should stay here for the night.

11:04.317 --> 11:06.233
The river won't make it much further.

11:07.570 --> 11:09.203
The horses could use a break.

11:09.238 --> 11:11.455
Then we press on.

11:11.541 --> 11:14.241
But her shackles stay on.

11:19.966 --> 11:22.299
You shouldn't let Crispin
talk to you that way.

11:22.385 --> 11:23.501
He's just trying to protect us.

11:23.586 --> 11:25.469
He knows the importance of this mission.

11:25.555 --> 11:26.754
Yeah, maybe.

11:26.806 --> 11:29.223
But the Ellcrys didn't
choose him for this quest.

11:29.258 --> 11:30.758
It chose you.

11:30.810 --> 11:32.309
Ever since we left the palace,

11:32.395 --> 11:34.094
you've been treating me like your enemy.

11:34.147 --> 11:36.814
- The tree said that we need to work...
- I know what it said.

11:41.571 --> 11:44.772
Look, I can't imagine how
hard this is for you,

11:44.857 --> 11:46.907
but you're not alone.

11:46.943 --> 11:48.108
Let me help you.

11:48.194 --> 11:50.161
You can't.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.092
All right, look.

11:53.178 --> 11:55.604
I know I lied to you about what
happened between me and Eretria.

11:56.185 --> 11:59.269
I was embarrassed, and I
let her take advantage,

11:59.355 --> 12:00.721
but it's not gonna happen again.

12:00.773 --> 12:03.724
I'm on your side.

12:03.809 --> 12:05.692
(men shouting and grunting)

12:19.241 --> 12:21.575
Weapons down!

12:21.627 --> 12:24.128
(laughing)

12:25.740 --> 12:26.906
Be honest.

12:26.993 --> 12:29.126
You missed me. (laughing)

12:45.435 --> 12:47.685
(horse whinnies)

12:59.122 --> 13:01.539
Demons slaughtered the entire village.

13:01.591 --> 13:02.923
Everyone.

13:03.009 --> 13:05.709
Mutilated the children.
They even gutted the dogs.

13:09.966 --> 13:13.183
Their tracks descend from the
north, down through the Kensrowe.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.354
Must be gathering at the Breakline.

13:16.389 --> 13:18.555
Father.

13:18.608 --> 13:20.474
Father, are you listening?

13:20.559 --> 13:22.476
Uh, the Breakline. Of course.

13:22.561 --> 13:23.811
These are just raiding parties.

13:23.896 --> 13:26.614
They're testing our resolve.

13:26.699 --> 13:28.198
We must attack before they gather...

13:28.234 --> 13:30.451
The Breakline is a mountain
range a thousand miles long.

13:30.536 --> 13:33.737
Even if we could find them, what then?

13:33.823 --> 13:37.574
The Elven army is the
strongest in the Four Lands.

13:37.627 --> 13:40.744
A handful of Demons did this.

13:40.830 --> 13:42.413
What would a hundred do?

13:42.465 --> 13:44.081
Or a thousand?

13:44.166 --> 13:46.000
Which is exactly why we
cannot wait for them

13:46.085 --> 13:47.635
to launch a full-scale attack.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.087
Our obligation is to the Ellcrys.

13:50.172 --> 13:52.756
We must secure the Sanctuary
until Amberle's return.

13:52.843 --> 13:54.759
We don't even know if
Amberle <i> will</i> return.

13:54.844 --> 13:57.094
This is not a debate!

13:58.898 --> 14:00.264
Secure the palace.

14:00.316 --> 14:03.400
You will guard and protect the Ellcrys.

14:03.436 --> 14:04.294
That is an order.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.481
- Manx!
- (Manx growls)

14:07.857 --> 14:09.323
He's trying, brother.

14:09.408 --> 14:12.776
No, he is scared.

14:12.862 --> 14:15.612
And his fear is gonna get us all killed.

14:16.699 --> 14:18.332
(chatter)

14:18.417 --> 14:20.084
Here, drink this.

14:20.119 --> 14:22.453
You'll be safe behind the palace walls.

14:30.930 --> 14:33.130
I could be wrong, but I
think it's a requirement

14:33.182 --> 14:35.933
that all soldiers be able
to dress themselves.

14:35.968 --> 14:39.937
It goes... like this.

14:42.109 --> 14:43.224
Thanks.

14:43.309 --> 14:48.395
Least I can do, you saving
me from a Demon and all.

14:48.481 --> 14:50.314
I owe you my life.

14:50.399 --> 14:53.067
Well, I'm just glad I
didn't freak you out again.

14:53.152 --> 14:55.903
Oh, you definitely freaked me out.

14:55.988 --> 14:58.789
Maybe you'll tell me how
you did it sometime.

14:58.824 --> 15:00.407
Maybe.

15:00.493 --> 15:02.159
How about tonight?

15:02.244 --> 15:04.878
Uh...

15:04.964 --> 15:06.747
I'll take that as a yes.

15:06.832 --> 15:08.499
I got to go.

15:13.005 --> 15:15.923
I can see you're enjoying
your time in the palace.

15:16.008 --> 15:19.059
What are you doing here?

15:19.145 --> 15:22.012
I'm here to stop you from
making a foolish mistake.

15:22.098 --> 15:24.848
You are no more a soldier
than I am a diplomat.

15:24.934 --> 15:27.651
Demons slaughtered my family.

15:27.686 --> 15:29.820
Took everything that I ever loved.

15:29.855 --> 15:32.356
It's my duty to fight.

15:32.408 --> 15:36.193
Your duty is to your gift.

15:36.278 --> 15:38.362
And I have need of it.

15:43.252 --> 15:46.286
So, you want me to talk to the tree.

15:46.372 --> 15:50.174
I want you to contact
Amberle through the tree.

15:50.209 --> 15:53.427
The Ellcrys and the
Princess are connected,

15:53.513 --> 15:57.549
but I can no longer sense her presence.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.017
Maybe you can.

16:00.052 --> 16:01.920
I see death. I don't...

16:03.889 --> 16:06.083
- This is crazy.
- Is it?

16:06.559 --> 16:09.810
You have seen Catania's
future and Lorin's past.

16:09.895 --> 16:11.228
You've been able to stretch your mind

16:11.313 --> 16:13.864
across time and space.

16:13.899 --> 16:15.899
Nobody knows what you're capable of.

16:15.985 --> 16:17.734
Not even you.

16:19.822 --> 16:23.240
But I believe your magic is powerful.

16:29.665 --> 16:30.798
Okay.

16:30.883 --> 16:32.800
So, what do I do?

16:35.254 --> 16:37.754
The Ellcrys is hundreds of
thousands of years old.

16:37.807 --> 16:39.973
It has witnessed life and death

16:40.059 --> 16:42.259
on a scale impossible to fathom.

16:42.311 --> 16:44.678
Yet in order to confront its power,

16:44.763 --> 16:47.931
you must learn to control your own.

16:51.153 --> 16:53.103
How?

17:00.913 --> 17:02.246
Practice.

17:05.451 --> 17:07.251
On you?

17:09.288 --> 17:11.121
No way. I mean, what if I see...

17:11.174 --> 17:13.458
The only thing you will
see is possibilities,

17:13.509 --> 17:14.842
nothing more.

17:23.886 --> 17:25.435
(gasping)

17:27.473 --> 17:28.689
(groaning)

17:28.774 --> 17:30.224
Calm yourself, boy.

17:30.309 --> 17:31.808
(groaning)

17:31.861 --> 17:34.144
Be the master of your own mind,

17:34.196 --> 17:35.529
not its prisoner.

17:40.903 --> 17:42.703
I did it.

17:42.788 --> 17:45.906
I... was there.

17:45.991 --> 17:50.327
The moment you died,
you felt my presence.

17:52.081 --> 17:53.497
I was able to control it.

17:53.582 --> 17:55.415
Good.

17:55.501 --> 17:56.667
Try again.

18:07.012 --> 18:09.062
What can I say, kiddo?

18:09.148 --> 18:10.814
You delivered the goods.

18:10.849 --> 18:12.349
The Stones.

18:12.401 --> 18:13.734
The Princess.

18:13.819 --> 18:15.903
She'll fetch a hell of
a price in Varfleet.

18:15.988 --> 18:17.688
As long as I have my freedom.

18:17.774 --> 18:19.190
Of course.

18:19.275 --> 18:20.824
Our camp's not far.

18:20.859 --> 18:23.026
Come have a hot meal and
collect your reward.

18:23.112 --> 18:24.528
You've earned it.

18:35.624 --> 18:37.424
(Stones rattling)

18:38.928 --> 18:40.594
Ohh...

18:40.679 --> 18:41.795
They're of no use to you.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.014
Oh? And why is that?

18:44.049 --> 18:45.849
You're not an Elf.

18:45.884 --> 18:48.885
I hate to break it to you,
Mongrel, but neither are you.

18:48.938 --> 18:50.938
(laughing)

18:51.023 --> 18:52.639
If we don't reach the fort by nightfall,

18:52.725 --> 18:54.891
they'll send soldiers after us.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.411
And when they do...

18:56.436 --> 18:58.919
You'll be nothing but
ragged flesh and bones.

18:58.981 --> 19:02.282
(groaning)

19:02.368 --> 19:04.284
This is marsh-wolf country.

19:04.370 --> 19:07.537
Once they catch your scent,
they'll come running,

19:07.573 --> 19:10.040
and they will eat you
alive while you watch.

19:10.075 --> 19:12.125
And once they've had their fill of Elf,

19:12.211 --> 19:14.294
they'll enjoy Mongrel for dessert.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.495
Rovers!

19:15.582 --> 19:16.748
Let's go!

19:18.751 --> 19:20.584
(whimpering)

19:26.725 --> 19:28.592
(horse whinnying)

19:41.000 --> 19:43.167
(birds screeching)

19:57.060 --> 19:59.727
You said we were meeting
with the generals.

20:03.817 --> 20:05.199
Father was right.

20:05.235 --> 20:07.819
Sending our army to the
Breakline is foolish,

20:07.904 --> 20:09.821
but standing by while Demons
slaughter our people,

20:09.906 --> 20:12.290
- it makes us look weak.
- What do you suggest?

20:12.375 --> 20:13.708
That I lead a small unit

20:13.743 --> 20:15.043
to track the Demons to their source.

20:15.078 --> 20:16.744
Once I establish our enemy's size,

20:16.796 --> 20:18.443
we can petition Father for more troops.

20:19.749 --> 20:23.418
No Elf has ever traveled beyond
the Breakline's outermost edges.

20:23.470 --> 20:25.586
Without an army, you won't survive.

20:25.672 --> 20:28.089
True, no Elf has.

20:28.141 --> 20:30.341
Which is why I need a guide.

20:30.427 --> 20:32.260
The Gnome, Slanter.

20:33.897 --> 20:35.513
He was born inside the Breakline.

20:35.598 --> 20:37.348
He knows its every peak and valley.

20:37.434 --> 20:40.268
That creature murdered our brother!

20:40.353 --> 20:41.569
Arion, listen to him.

20:41.604 --> 20:45.940
Our niece, Aine's daughter,
is out there alone.

20:45.992 --> 20:48.910
Tell me you can sit still while
she shoulders that burden.

20:48.945 --> 20:52.330
Tell me and... and I'll walk away.

21:00.206 --> 21:01.789
You plotted this behind my back?

21:01.875 --> 21:03.958
You said you wanted to do something.

21:04.044 --> 21:05.793
This?

21:05.845 --> 21:07.712
This is not what I meant.

21:07.797 --> 21:09.964
Arion...

21:12.185 --> 21:14.969
(grunting)

21:15.021 --> 21:17.355
(horse whinnying)

21:26.533 --> 21:28.149
Eretria.

21:35.792 --> 21:38.710
Look, you're right, you
have no reason to trust me.

21:38.795 --> 21:41.162
But you were chosen just like me.

21:41.247 --> 21:43.715
We may not like it, but
we're in this together.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.501
We couldn't be any less together.

21:46.553 --> 21:48.669
How much did he promise you?

21:48.755 --> 21:51.339
Cephalo mentioned a reward.
Gold, I'm guessing.

21:51.391 --> 21:52.507
What's your point?

21:52.592 --> 21:54.759
This place is no palace.

21:54.844 --> 21:56.344
Whatever Cephalo's offered you,

21:56.396 --> 21:58.596
my grandfather will pay 20 times that.

21:58.681 --> 22:00.348
(Cephalo) Ah...

22:00.433 --> 22:02.767
just the lovely ladies I was looking for.

22:02.852 --> 22:04.569
(liquid sloshes)

22:04.654 --> 22:07.605
Ahh.

22:07.690 --> 22:09.524
I am almost gonna miss you.

22:09.609 --> 22:12.276
Am I free to go?

22:12.362 --> 22:15.163
I may be a bastard,

22:15.198 --> 22:18.199
but I'm a bastard who keeps his word.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.705
What...

22:24.791 --> 22:26.207
no hug?

22:27.844 --> 22:29.343
That's okay.

22:31.598 --> 22:33.131
(sighs)

22:33.216 --> 22:35.266
I'm sure you'll be much
more accommodating.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.719
Never had Elf before.

22:40.890 --> 22:43.441
Is it true what they say?

22:43.526 --> 22:45.193
You're a pig.

22:45.228 --> 22:47.895
(snorts)

22:47.947 --> 22:49.530
(laughing)

22:51.401 --> 22:53.568
(Amberle whimpering)

23:00.076 --> 23:01.242
(Crispin) We need to move.

23:01.294 --> 23:03.127
We'll die out here in the open.

23:03.213 --> 23:05.329
We can't go anywhere until
we stop the bleeding.

23:05.415 --> 23:07.321
Your Rover girl's gonna
burn for this, boy.

23:07.391 --> 23:08.069
Great.

23:08.218 --> 23:10.585
I'll be sure and tell her
the next time we hang out.

23:10.637 --> 23:12.053
Aah!

23:12.088 --> 23:15.590
- (groaning)
- (distant howling)

23:19.062 --> 23:21.095
(man) Where's it coming from?

23:28.738 --> 23:32.023
(laughter and chatter)

23:32.108 --> 23:33.774
I want some more.

23:33.827 --> 23:35.443
Ah, yeah!

23:35.528 --> 23:38.830
I know a brothel owner who
pays triple for Elves.

23:38.915 --> 23:40.531
Got a little fight in ya. Good.

23:40.617 --> 23:42.283
(whimpers)

23:43.953 --> 23:45.786
(shouting) Help!

23:45.872 --> 23:47.288
Please help me!

23:47.373 --> 23:48.623
(laughing)

23:48.708 --> 23:49.957
Yell all you want, Princess.

23:50.043 --> 23:52.760
It's nothing but music to me.

23:52.795 --> 23:54.795
(groans)

23:58.635 --> 23:59.967
Thank you.

24:00.019 --> 24:02.603
20 times what Cephalo paid.

24:02.639 --> 24:03.971
That's what you said.

24:04.023 --> 24:06.524
Of course. You have my word.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.317
(groaning)

24:20.790 --> 24:23.040
You thieving little bitch!

24:23.126 --> 24:24.742
Hey, you're the one who taught me

24:24.827 --> 24:27.378
the value of a good double-cross.

24:27.463 --> 24:29.630
Horses are outside. Let's go.

24:29.666 --> 24:31.799
You're bringing him with us?

24:31.834 --> 24:34.001
Unless you'd like to do the honors.

24:34.087 --> 24:36.220
If he is with us, he's not hunting us.

24:36.306 --> 24:38.089
Consider him insurance.

24:38.174 --> 24:42.510
You think my men will ever
let you walk out of here?

24:42.562 --> 24:44.345
You're right.

24:46.015 --> 24:47.899
It's a good thing I took care of them.

24:50.653 --> 24:53.654
Nothing a little knockout
powder can't handle.

25:02.072 --> 25:03.655
(Crispin) Stay in formation.

25:03.690 --> 25:05.323
Fill the gaps.

25:10.163 --> 25:12.497
What is that? What are you doing?

25:12.532 --> 25:14.199
Bite down, big guy.

25:15.752 --> 25:18.286
You're gonna feel this.

25:18.371 --> 25:19.838
(groaning)

25:24.845 --> 25:26.878
(groaning)

25:29.049 --> 25:30.181
(growling)

25:32.969 --> 25:36.638
(growling continues)

25:36.723 --> 25:38.139
I can see it.

25:38.225 --> 25:39.557
Oh!

25:39.643 --> 25:40.942
Oh, no!

25:42.979 --> 25:44.729
(shrieking and growling)

25:47.734 --> 25:49.400
(blade clangs)

25:49.486 --> 25:52.153
(wolf whimpering)

25:52.239 --> 25:55.957
I leave you alone for a couple
of hours and look what happens.

26:00.413 --> 26:03.081
You completely fall apart.

26:04.584 --> 26:06.751
(birds chirping)

26:17.647 --> 26:19.430
Looking good.

26:19.483 --> 26:21.399
What do they feed you boys in the Vale?

26:25.272 --> 26:27.939
Thought you'd be happy to see me.

26:27.991 --> 26:29.190
Just 'cause you did the right thing

26:29.276 --> 26:32.443
once in your life doesn't
mean I trust you.

26:32.529 --> 26:35.280
You screwed me in the woods
when I first met you,

26:35.365 --> 26:37.615
and you screwed me at the
castle when I knew better.

26:37.701 --> 26:39.450
I'm in no rush to let you do that again.

26:39.536 --> 26:42.036
Well, that's too bad.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.088
You're pretty good in bed.

26:51.765 --> 26:53.965
(distant screaming)

26:54.050 --> 26:55.517
(punches landing)

26:55.602 --> 26:58.102
(Amberle) Enough.

26:58.138 --> 27:01.189
- Enough!
- (men grunting)

27:01.274 --> 27:03.474
I said, enough!

27:04.895 --> 27:06.644
All due respect, Your Highness,

27:06.730 --> 27:08.813
but get out of my way. Now!

27:08.865 --> 27:11.783
I understand you want justice,
Captain, but not like this.

27:11.818 --> 27:13.234
Keeping him alive is a mistake.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.320
Maybe.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.989
But if so, it will be my mistake.
Now stand down.

27:19.583 --> 27:20.999
(spits)

27:21.084 --> 27:23.001
We're not done, Rover.

27:23.086 --> 27:24.252
Aye-aye, Captain.

27:41.221 --> 27:43.021
You hear that?

27:43.106 --> 27:45.807
(silence)

27:48.195 --> 27:49.978
I don't hear anything.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.396
Exactly.

27:51.481 --> 27:52.814
No birds.

27:53.950 --> 27:56.151
- Scout.
- Yes, sir.

27:58.822 --> 28:00.822
(horse whinnies)

28:07.631 --> 28:09.047
Take a look up ahead.

28:09.132 --> 28:10.548
Yes, sir.

28:15.889 --> 28:17.806
Anything we should know?

28:19.393 --> 28:20.759
Scouting for tracks.

28:20.844 --> 28:22.010
According to the map,

28:22.062 --> 28:23.928
the fort is just beyond these woods.

28:24.014 --> 28:26.064
I don't want any more nasty surprises.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.020
(horse chuffing)

28:46.670 --> 28:48.670
(whinnying)

28:51.842 --> 28:54.175
Help! Help!

28:55.378 --> 28:56.628
(loud groaning)

28:56.713 --> 28:58.263
- We have to help him!
- Princess.

28:58.348 --> 28:59.514
That area is poison.

28:59.549 --> 29:01.015
We have to stay back.

29:12.395 --> 29:14.562
The wind is changing.

29:14.587 --> 29:15.969
We have to move.

29:19.718 --> 29:21.217
(door slams)

29:26.608 --> 29:28.725
(growling)

29:42.407 --> 29:44.290
(roars)

29:58.345 --> 30:00.979
I come in peace, Gnome.

30:01.014 --> 30:03.431
I've been locked up for 10 years.

30:03.517 --> 30:07.569
The only peace I will accept is
your father's head on a pike.

30:09.022 --> 30:10.738
I have something better.

30:12.192 --> 30:14.609
This is a key to your shackles.

30:14.694 --> 30:16.327
What is this?

30:19.749 --> 30:21.416
A proposition.

30:23.370 --> 30:26.371
Your help in exchange for your freedom.

30:26.456 --> 30:31.676
You must be desperate to come to me.

30:31.711 --> 30:34.429
The Elves are scared.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.682
We are.

30:37.717 --> 30:40.885
- And you should be, too.
- (snorts)

30:40.971 --> 30:44.389
The Dagda Mor has returned.

30:46.026 --> 30:48.393
Then we're all undone.

30:56.069 --> 30:57.785
You're sure about this?

30:57.871 --> 31:00.622
There is no certainty with magic...

31:00.707 --> 31:03.374
but we are running out of time.

31:03.410 --> 31:06.661
Control your emotions.

31:06.746 --> 31:08.246
Sure.

31:40.614 --> 31:45.166
I felt her magic calling
to me, young one.

31:45.252 --> 31:46.451
What have you done to Amberle?

31:46.536 --> 31:49.420
You cannot save the girl.

31:49.456 --> 31:53.625
The Druid was a fool to send you.

31:53.693 --> 31:54.926
(gasps)

31:58.131 --> 31:59.347
(whimpering)

31:59.432 --> 32:00.765
(screaming)

32:02.802 --> 32:04.135
Brandon!

32:04.187 --> 32:05.520
Brandon!

32:11.278 --> 32:13.561
(Crispin) 3,000 years have passed,

32:13.647 --> 32:16.314
yet humankind's weapons
are still claiming lives.

32:16.399 --> 32:18.149
I lost a good man back there, Rover.

32:18.201 --> 32:21.035
(Cephalo) Oh, don't worry
about it, Captain.

32:21.121 --> 32:23.154
The Elves will get their
chance to destroy the world.

32:23.206 --> 32:25.039
(Wil) I hate to interrupt,

32:25.125 --> 32:26.374
but when the demons show up,

32:26.459 --> 32:28.493
there won't be any Elf this, human that.

32:28.545 --> 32:31.629
It'll just be us and them.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.549
Look!

32:48.848 --> 32:51.349
We made it!

32:55.322 --> 32:56.904
Where are the guards?

33:02.195 --> 33:04.696
(horn blaring)

33:14.874 --> 33:16.874
(gasping)

33:19.929 --> 33:21.012
Let me guess.

33:21.047 --> 33:22.764
Rin Katsin.

33:25.885 --> 33:27.385
(growling)

33:33.893 --> 33:35.693
(growling continues)

33:38.064 --> 33:39.564
(thudding footsteps)

33:47.073 --> 33:48.790
(loud growling)

33:50.293 --> 33:52.910
Fall back! Scouts, engage!

33:52.962 --> 33:55.496
Retreat to the woods and stay hidden.

33:55.582 --> 33:57.415
That thing will tear your men apart!

33:57.467 --> 33:58.916
(growling)

34:00.420 --> 34:02.503
- Princess, cut me loose!
- Don't listen to him!

34:02.589 --> 34:04.055
Do not do it.

34:04.090 --> 34:05.256
Come on!

34:05.341 --> 34:06.924
(Demon roaring)

34:12.766 --> 34:14.431
Take the Princess to the woods.

34:14.484 --> 34:15.733
Short Tips and I will distract

34:15.768 --> 34:17.068
that big bastard with the Stones.

34:17.103 --> 34:19.103
- Let's go.
- We will?

34:19.188 --> 34:20.605
(growling)

34:23.109 --> 34:24.775
Fire those Stones up, kid!

34:27.614 --> 34:29.163
They're not working!

34:29.248 --> 34:30.331
Time for Plan B.

34:30.417 --> 34:31.916
- Which is?
- Run!

34:31.951 --> 34:33.835
(Demon roaring)

34:42.870 --> 34:44.503
(Demon growling)

34:52.857 --> 34:54.572
Give me your dagger and your water skin.

34:54.609 --> 34:56.645
- What? Why?
- So I can stab you in the neck.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.841
Just give 'em to me!

34:58.927 --> 35:02.128
I didn't survive out here all these
years without learning a few tricks.

35:05.767 --> 35:07.934
(Demon roaring)

35:12.607 --> 35:14.140
Aah!

35:15.527 --> 35:17.276
Take this.

35:21.483 --> 35:23.649
He's going after Amberle.

35:23.702 --> 35:25.118
We need to draw it away.

35:25.153 --> 35:26.486
- (blade clangs)
- Ow! What the hell?

35:26.538 --> 35:28.538
Demons are drawn by blood.

35:28.623 --> 35:29.906
I think.

35:29.991 --> 35:32.041
You think?

35:32.127 --> 35:34.961
(Demon growling)

35:40.969 --> 35:42.168
(Wil) Now what?

35:42.220 --> 35:44.337
Now we see how tough
this bastard really is.

35:44.389 --> 35:45.722
Come on.

35:47.475 --> 35:49.058
(roaring)

35:58.269 --> 36:00.436
(Demon growling)

36:00.522 --> 36:02.238
Move fast.

36:02.323 --> 36:04.524
Stick to dry land.

36:04.576 --> 36:06.609
Breathe as little as possible.

36:06.694 --> 36:08.111
(roaring)

36:08.196 --> 36:10.029
Let's go.

36:17.372 --> 36:18.704
Get down!

36:21.676 --> 36:23.876
(growling)

36:27.682 --> 36:30.183
(Demon roaring)

36:40.228 --> 36:41.727
(laughing)

36:41.780 --> 36:44.113
Told you I had a plan.

36:54.576 --> 36:56.909
(growling)

37:06.838 --> 37:11.090
Having second thoughts, Prince?

37:11.176 --> 37:13.476
And third and fourth ones.

37:13.561 --> 37:15.561
With good reason.

37:15.597 --> 37:17.680
The Breakline is no place for an Elf.

37:17.765 --> 37:21.317
It's no place for anyone as
long as Demons inhabit it.

37:21.402 --> 37:23.603
Diana. How did you know that I'd be here?

37:23.688 --> 37:26.272
Because when someone tells you
no, you tend to do the opposite.

37:26.324 --> 37:27.857
If you're here to stop
me, save your breath.

37:27.942 --> 37:29.075
I have to do this.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.409
What you're doing is treason.

37:30.445 --> 37:32.078
If you have a better
idea, I'm all points.

37:32.113 --> 37:35.198
- We do. I'm going with you.
- The hell you are.

37:35.283 --> 37:36.582
The Chosen died on my watch.

37:36.618 --> 37:39.285
Won't let these creatures
take you as well.

37:42.173 --> 37:43.789
(Ander) You're okay with this?

37:43.842 --> 37:45.424
No, not at all.

37:47.045 --> 37:50.713
But like you said, we
have to do something.

37:50.798 --> 37:52.715
What about Father?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.517
I'll handle Father.

37:57.021 --> 37:59.272
You two just focus on
getting back here alive.

37:59.307 --> 38:00.306
Don't worry.

38:00.358 --> 38:03.192
We'll be back before you know it.

38:03.278 --> 38:04.477
(Gnome laughing)

38:07.482 --> 38:08.814
Let's go.

38:10.235 --> 38:12.151
Move.

38:12.237 --> 38:13.986
Keep walking.

38:20.495 --> 38:21.878
(Eventine) Manx?

38:23.915 --> 38:25.464
Manx?

38:29.754 --> 38:32.889
Forgive the intrusion, Father.

38:32.974 --> 38:34.257
I couldn't sleep.

38:34.342 --> 38:36.509
Oh, me neither.

38:36.561 --> 38:38.511
I can't find Manx.

38:38.596 --> 38:40.179
I'm worried about him.

38:40.265 --> 38:42.148
We are at war,

38:42.183 --> 38:43.816
and you're worried about a hound.

38:43.851 --> 38:45.518
Well, he is loyal to me.

38:47.822 --> 38:49.739
What's the matter, boy?

38:49.824 --> 38:51.774
What's wrong?

38:51.859 --> 38:54.410
I have failed you, Father.

38:54.495 --> 38:57.330
I've let you down.

38:57.365 --> 38:59.248
And I don't know how.

39:00.535 --> 39:04.921
But this rift between us, I...
I can't bear it.

39:05.006 --> 39:07.123
Look, you have not let me down.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.875
The world has let me down.

39:09.928 --> 39:13.346
I need you by my side now more than ever.

39:13.381 --> 39:16.132
But not on the throne.

39:16.217 --> 39:18.601
No, not until my work is done.

39:21.973 --> 39:23.522
(blade clangs, groaning)

39:25.977 --> 39:28.644
Well, if you will not give me the throne,

39:28.730 --> 39:31.230
then I'll just have to take it.

39:31.282 --> 39:33.115
(loud groan)

40:04.975 --> 40:06.880
Long live the king.
