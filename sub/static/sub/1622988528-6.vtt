WEBVTT

02:27.439 --> 02:28.690
This is five, over.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.444
This is base, over.
What's up, Danny?

02:33.028 --> 02:36.823
Everything is quiet at the Landon house.
I'm gonna go home and get some shut-eye.

02:37.366 --> 02:41.578
Beckman, 10-10 at 1:25 a.m. Got it.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.959
I'm gonna swing by
her sister's house on my way. She's--

02:48.418 --> 02:49.753
She's away.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.340
If he gets too close,
I want you to stick him.

06:21.423 --> 06:25.093
Right into his neck. Okay?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.473
I love you, Daddy.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.436
I love you too, kiddo.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.684
Amanda...

08:39.895 --> 08:42.188
this is hot, so I'm gonna
hold this for you, okay?

08:42.272 --> 08:47.861
Scott gave me a drink, but not cocoa.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.991
It was cool water.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.494
It was beautiful water.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.491
It's the Hollyhocks! Go faster!

10:17.910 --> 10:21.830
It's the Hollyhocks, it's the Hollyhocks,

10:21.914 --> 10:25.000
it's the Hollyhocks, it's the Hollyhocks.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.341
Lisey.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.553
Lisey.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.042
Lisey.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.720
Yes.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.794
Pictures. Lighthouse.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.056
Amanda.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.373
I'll help you, Lisey.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.337
Only bring me home.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.133
Bring me home, Lisey. Bring me home!

12:45.390 --> 12:49.436
Yes. Yes. I'll bring you.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.688
Good.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.528
Help me.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.616
Hey.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.119
You okay?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.165
He was here, right?

15:16.708 --> 15:20.712
Okay, well, if he comes back,
we are well stocked.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.465
So this is what I found.

15:23.549 --> 15:26.677
This, which I think is a pepper spray.

15:27.928 --> 15:28.929
And...

15:32.349 --> 15:35.435
This is a kind of Mace, I think.

15:35.519 --> 15:40.649
Our sister was really fond of Mace.
This is also-- it's like a Mace gun.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.901
Kill him with some Mace.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.028
This seems interesting to me.
It's called a screecher,

15:45.112 --> 15:47.990
and I think it makes a big sound

15:48.073 --> 15:52.202
and maybe we can scare him off
or make him go deaf or something like...

15:55.330 --> 15:58.500
And this is the taser
that I was telling you about, so...

16:00.878 --> 16:03.005
"Thanks, Darla." Oh, you're welcome. Okay.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.799
How you doing?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.010
I'm sure I could've found other things,

16:08.093 --> 16:10.721
but her house is even creepier
without her in it, so...

16:16.018 --> 16:21.565
Wow. You've really packed a lot up.
You're making progress. That's good.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.527
You could be an anchor too.

16:26.570 --> 16:29.781
I can't risk having both of my sisters
stranded over there.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.455
Right. Right.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.668
I haven't had my coffee yet.

16:55.641 --> 16:56.850
Lisey?

16:58.477 --> 16:59.478
Lisey?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.730
Come on. Where'd you go?

17:02.439 --> 17:03.440
Oh, shit.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.153
Lisey. Lisey, Lisey!

17:26.839 --> 17:30.425
The flowers.
Can I touch them? Is it safe?

17:30.509 --> 17:34.221
I took one back once,
but it died right away.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.474
Lisey!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.268
Darla.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.815
Lisey, what just happened?
Where did you go?

17:45.399 --> 17:48.026
I knew that you wouldn't believe me
without a demonstration.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.445
Scott was right. Water is best.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.698
-How?
-I was in Booya Moon.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.450
-No, no, no.
-Yes.

17:55.534 --> 17:58.620
Amanda's there too. Part of her, anyway.

17:58.704 --> 18:02.541
Yeah, okay, okay. You-- You--
You're starting to s-scare me now.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.293
Look, I brought this back for you.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.962
-It's a trick, right?
-No.

18:08.589 --> 18:12.593
-I really hate this, Lisey.
-I know. I know you do. I'm so sorry.

18:12.676 --> 18:13.677
I want to go home.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.387
-No. No.
-I want to go home for a little while.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.764
-I want to get back into bed.
-No, I need you, and I need Amanda.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.349
I need my sisters.

18:20.601 --> 18:21.935
He's gonna kill us.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.229
-Dooley?
-Dooley.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.651
This is real.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.372
-Yes?
-Professor Dashmiel, it's Lisa Landon.

18:43.248 --> 18:46.126
I don't want to talk to you.
I've explained already.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.336
I just wa-- I just...

18:48.086 --> 18:49.838
I just wanted to tell you that I'm--

18:49.922 --> 18:54.259
I'm considering lodging a suit against you
for half a million dollars for harassment.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.553
Miss Landon, I--

18:56.637 --> 18:58.222
My lawyers want it
to be three millions dollars,

18:58.305 --> 19:00.140
but I was like, "There's no way
that he can ever make that.

19:00.224 --> 19:02.976
But half a million, I mean if he,
like, you know, sells some stock

19:03.060 --> 19:07.022
and empties out his IRA and gets rid of
his house, well, he can do that, right?"

19:07.981 --> 19:11.818
-Miss Landon, I apologize. I'm so sorry.
-Oh, God.

19:11.902 --> 19:12.903
You know what Scott would say?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.739
He would say, "If sorry were rain,
the Sahara would be underwater."

19:17.741 --> 19:20.953
But there are some things that you could
do that would make me change my mind.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.330
Of course. Anything.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.417
Okay. So if Dooley contacts you--

19:27.501 --> 19:28.919
Miss Landon, I told you--

19:29.002 --> 19:31.171
Listen to me! Listen to me, listen to me.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.382
Listen to me.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.009
If Dooley gets in touch with you,

19:36.093 --> 19:40.597
tell him that I have changed my mind,
I've regained my senses,

19:40.681 --> 19:45.269
and he should meet me tonight
in my husband's study at 10:00 p.m.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.313
You sound like a person

19:48.397 --> 19:52.150
that's about to get herself into
a great deal of trouble, Mrs. Landon.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.695
Well, you-- you'd know about that,
wouldn't you?

19:56.280 --> 19:58.365
Okay, so here's the second thing.
It's a flat lie,

19:58.448 --> 20:00.367
but I figured since
you've been telling everybody

20:00.450 --> 20:01.952
you saved my husband's life
all these years,

20:02.035 --> 20:03.620
that you'd be okay with that.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.748
I want you to call the Cleaves Mills
Police Department, talk to Chief Richards,

20:06.832 --> 20:09.668
and tell him that
your pet maniac called you

20:09.751 --> 20:11.587
and said he was scared off by the police.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.464
Do you understand
what I'm asking you to do?

20:14.548 --> 20:17.926
-Yes, I-- But--
-You do, you understand.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.178
Do you understand me?

20:19.261 --> 20:23.056
Well, your threat's empty.
I engaged a lawyer and he said--

20:23.140 --> 20:27.603
Oh, you have a lawyer?
Yeah, well, I have a bunch.

20:27.686 --> 20:30.564
I also have $60 million,

20:30.647 --> 20:35.277
so if we decide to ass fuck you,
you're gonna be bleeding for a long time.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.005
Mr. Dooley, it's Lisa Landon.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.507
I'm gonna visit my sister in Auburn,

20:56.590 --> 20:58.509
-but then meet me here at 10:00 p.m.--
-Okay, stop. No, no, no.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.219
Rewind. That was terrible.

21:14.274 --> 21:18.403
Mr. Dooley, it's Lisa Landon. Please don't
hurt me. You win, you can have it all.

21:18.487 --> 21:21.782
Meet me at 10:00 p.m,
and I promise I won't--

21:23.200 --> 21:25.327
-I hate that. I can't do that.
-It's not good.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.756
Mr. Dooley, it's Lisey Landon.

21:39.508 --> 21:41.802
You win. I'll give you whatever you want.

21:41.885 --> 21:46.056
Meet me here at 10:00 p.m. I won't call
the police, but please just don't hurt me.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.392
Don't hurt me anymore.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.359
That was good.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.404
No, none of-- none of this is good.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.783
You know what you're doing, right?

22:06.201 --> 22:10.122
Whenever Scott started a speaking tour
to promote one of his books,

22:10.914 --> 22:13.959
he always began his talks
with the same idea.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.586
Talked about the struggle.

22:16.336 --> 22:19.756
Said that every novel is a struggle
between the writer and the story,

22:19.840 --> 22:21.466
and the writer always tried to hold on,

22:21.550 --> 22:25.220
but at a certain point, he had to let go
and let the story tell itself.

22:25.304 --> 22:27.639
And that's what I'm trying to do now.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.350
This story has a happy ending, right?

22:32.686 --> 22:33.812
I don't know.

22:53.165 --> 22:55.375
Hi. We're here to see our sister.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.628
Of course. Oh, you might want to know.

22:57.711 --> 23:02.007
Amanda, Miss Debusher, was talking
a little, but now she's stopped.

23:02.090 --> 23:05.677
And Dr. Gold says we may have to
catheterize her because she's not moving.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.638
Okay. Okay, thanks.

23:10.682 --> 23:14.811
Well, of course she's not moving. She's
in that other place. Boolie Moon, right?

23:14.895 --> 23:18.190
Yes. Lots of others like her, thousands.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.483
But she's also here.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.026
Yes, because she's a double.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.195
-Don't forget she's also an anchor.
-Yes.

23:23.779 --> 23:25.322
Sorry, I don't get any of this.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.740
You don't have to understand.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.993
-No, I don't have to, but I'd like to.
-God, just stop it, okay?

23:41.421 --> 23:42.422
Hey.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.468
Hey, Amanda, it's Darla.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.387
Won't you look at me?

23:51.306 --> 23:53.809
Pirate ships are fine for little girls.

23:55.102 --> 23:56.895
That was a long time ago.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.481
We need you back.

24:08.699 --> 24:10.325
Is this how your story ends?

24:10.409 --> 24:13.287
With her living here for the next 20 years
and peeing in a bag?

24:41.231 --> 24:45.402
Scott knew you for what you are,
didn't he?

24:47.446 --> 24:49.072
He knew you were a cutter.

24:50.991 --> 24:52.284
Just like him.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.913
He knew that you were one of the gone.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.834
He went after you
the last time you went away.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.840
He did something,
but he knew that it might happen again,

25:06.924 --> 25:09.718
so he reserved a place for you here.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.762
I think he foresaw everything.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.515
Including Jim Dooley.

25:17.518 --> 25:19.478
Will you let me know if you hear me?

25:42.835 --> 25:44.878
What did he do, Amanda?

25:46.463 --> 25:48.131
How did he bring you back?

25:56.390 --> 25:57.599
In the bad.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.061
That's when you cut.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.356
To let it out.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.901
I know all about it.

26:09.778 --> 26:14.491
Learned it a long time ago.
When I was a kid.

26:25.127 --> 26:27.671
This is just between us.

26:36.597 --> 26:38.348
Kissed me.

26:39.266 --> 26:40.392
What?

26:44.938 --> 26:48.108
It was cool water. Beautiful water.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.736
He said it was from the pool.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.488
The one in Booya Moon.

27:58.929 --> 28:02.933
How? I can see you.
I can see-- I can see you.

28:03.016 --> 28:05.185
Couldn't get up. It was so awful.

28:05.269 --> 28:06.562
It was awful.

28:07.229 --> 28:09.815
But he said that you would--
you would come for me,

28:09.898 --> 28:12.818
because you came for him,
and you came for me.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.403
-You did.
-Scott? Scott?

28:14.486 --> 28:15.904
Scott told you that?

28:15.988 --> 28:17.781
When-- When did he tell you that?

28:17.865 --> 28:19.741
It was some-- It was--

28:20.492 --> 28:24.621
It was after my last break
and not long before he died.

28:25.330 --> 28:28.083
But he said that--
that I should come back,

28:28.166 --> 28:31.879
and that I should come home,
because you needed me.

28:31.962 --> 28:33.714
-I do.
-You do need me.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.632
I do need you.

28:35.716 --> 28:37.467
I need you. I need you.

28:37.551 --> 28:39.887
I need you both,
because someone is trying to hurt me.

28:39.970 --> 28:42.055
-Someone-- Someone is trying to kill me.
-What?

28:43.098 --> 28:45.726
-Okay, what are we gonna tell the doctor?
-What?

28:45.809 --> 28:47.519
What would Scott have told him?

28:47.603 --> 28:48.979
Scott...

29:06.205 --> 29:07.206
Scott?

29:08.415 --> 29:09.416
Hey.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.084
Hey.

29:12.586 --> 29:13.587
What you doing?

29:15.005 --> 29:16.340
Is that The Night People?

29:16.840 --> 29:20.302
Yeah. I just got it back from Carson,
my esteemed editor.

29:20.385 --> 29:21.595
Look at this.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.850
"Creaks a bit, old boy"?

29:28.310 --> 29:32.439
Can't believe he said that.
Are you gonna fix it or fight him?

29:33.106 --> 29:35.359
Fix it, probably. He's right.

29:35.442 --> 29:39.488
The reunion scene's a little unbelievable.

29:39.571 --> 29:42.157
On the other hand, look at this.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.787
That is so cute.

29:47.579 --> 29:50.082
I don't know what it has to do
with your editor, though.

29:50.165 --> 29:53.126
Well, what would he say if Ralph the corgi
turned up in one of my books?

29:53.210 --> 29:56.338
Well, he'd probably say
that it creaked a bit.

29:57.130 --> 30:00.843
We novelists, you know,
we have to worry about motivation,

30:00.926 --> 30:02.928
beware of coincidence,

30:03.011 --> 30:06.598
you know, and describe the situations,
which is total bullshit.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.476
Life doesn't work like that. Never did.

30:09.560 --> 30:14.147
Reality is a fucking dog
that somehow travels 1,500 miles

30:14.231 --> 30:16.733
and turns up at home after three years.

30:18.068 --> 30:19.862
Ralph is reality.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.322
That would make a good bumper sticker.

30:25.325 --> 30:26.785
Dance with me, babyluv.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.871
No, I have to go downtown
and run some errands.

30:28.954 --> 30:31.164
-I'll be back this aft--
-Fuck downtown. Fuck errands.

30:31.248 --> 30:34.585
Life is short. Dance with me, babyluv.

31:51.870 --> 31:52.871
Ralph.

32:00.712 --> 32:01.755
Okay.

32:17.271 --> 32:20.816
Okay, careful.
We're going down now. Down.

32:27.906 --> 32:30.325
It's okay, it's okay.

32:31.201 --> 32:32.578
There you go.

32:39.918 --> 32:41.170
Miss Debusher.

32:41.253 --> 32:45.090
We'd like to see Dr. Alberness, please.
I'm leaving.

32:45.799 --> 32:47.968
We were visiting with her. We were just--

32:48.051 --> 32:52.598
We were just talking to her, as you
suggested, and-- and she came around.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.559
Is that really what happened?

32:55.642 --> 32:58.854
Yes, and I need to go home now.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.608
I don't think that would be
the wisest course of--

33:02.691 --> 33:03.817
Hey, is that you?

33:04.985 --> 33:05.986
Yes.

33:06.528 --> 33:07.821
You're in good shape.

33:08.906 --> 33:10.240
Thank you.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.831
what's the last thing you remember,
Amanda?

33:19.041 --> 33:22.628
I... I cut myself.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.130
I was in my house.

33:25.214 --> 33:31.011
I cut myself, Lisey came,
then Darla, may-- maybe both of them,

33:31.512 --> 33:35.891
and then I woke up... here.

33:37.142 --> 33:40.103
That-- That's what it was like waking up.

33:42.189 --> 33:46.276
And I'm-- I think
because they called me back.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.283
I...

33:53.992 --> 33:55.494
I have heard of such things.

33:55.577 --> 33:59.122
I mean, there-- there are cases
in Jung's Psychological Types.

33:59.998 --> 34:01.333
But I've never seen one.

34:03.252 --> 34:05.838
Well, frankly, I'm-- I'm amazed.

34:05.921 --> 34:07.840
Whoa! Bruce Springsteen?

34:07.923 --> 34:10.300
That's-- That's The Boss. I mean...

34:10.384 --> 34:12.010
You-- You actually met him?

34:12.094 --> 34:14.763
Yes, yes. Backstage passes. Amanda--

34:14.847 --> 34:17.056
So, was he, like, nice,
or was he all show-bizzy?

34:17.139 --> 34:18.600
Oh, very nice.

34:19.976 --> 34:23.522
Amanda, I-- I think
you should stay a few days,

34:23.605 --> 34:25.815
just to make sure everything's okay.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.820
I appreciate the-- the care that
you have given me, Dr. Alberness,

34:29.902 --> 34:31.405
but I-- I need to go now.

34:31.487 --> 34:34.283
We will be with her day and night,
Dr. Alberness.

34:34.366 --> 34:36.326
-Hugh.
-Hugh.

34:36.409 --> 34:39.621
And, of course,
I'll arrange for her ongoing care.

34:39.705 --> 34:42.791
Well, I hardly think I'm gonna be
needing any ongoing care, though--

34:42.875 --> 34:45.002
No, I think you're gonna need
some ongoing care,

34:45.085 --> 34:47.129
so I'm gonna talk to Hugh
and the doctors about this.

34:47.212 --> 34:48.797
-No. Lisey...
-That's what you're gonna need.

34:48.880 --> 34:49.882
Fine.

34:50.799 --> 34:55.053
Okay. This is highly irregular. Now,
I think I should at least do a few tests.

34:55.137 --> 34:56.138
No!

34:57.431 --> 35:01.560
Hugh, do you know what
Scott would've said about this?

35:01.643 --> 35:05.230
"Don't analyze. Utilize."

35:06.356 --> 35:07.941
Accept the gift.

35:12.321 --> 35:14.072
Accept the gift.

35:17.451 --> 35:19.161
Al Gore. I love him.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.038
I voted for him.

35:21.121 --> 35:23.457
He's done such great things.
You know he actually won an Oscar?

35:24.041 --> 35:27.753
Did you treat him? I know you can't say,
but I'd love to know.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.630
Scott loved him too.

35:30.797 --> 35:32.007
It's a good shot of you.

35:33.050 --> 35:34.176
Very handsome.

35:43.936 --> 35:46.855
Here we go.
Is he a prick or is it just me?

35:46.939 --> 35:47.940
He's a prick.

35:48.649 --> 35:49.900
Al Gore.

35:50.526 --> 35:52.611
My panties are all getting damp.

35:52.694 --> 35:56.198
Yep, forgot how restful and peaceful
it was when you were catatonic.

35:56.281 --> 35:59.243
Okay. She's out. That's the important
thing. We got her out.

35:59.326 --> 36:03.372
No, no, it was a voluntary committal.
They couldn't keep me.

36:04.039 --> 36:06.583
Dear God, here comes the gratitude.

36:09.962 --> 36:11.380
I am grateful.

36:13.340 --> 36:16.343
You'll never know.
Thank you, both. Thank you.

36:16.426 --> 36:17.427
All right.

36:25.561 --> 36:26.562
Yeah.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.524
-No, no, no, no. This way.
-No, no, no, sweetie.

36:32.234 --> 36:33.402
Car's this way.

37:32.419 --> 37:36.089
And I knew that I was going,

37:36.173 --> 37:38.967
and I just--
I couldn't stop it, and then...

37:42.179 --> 37:44.598
I thought that
I would be there forever and...

37:46.475 --> 37:47.476
Oh, God.

37:48.018 --> 37:49.686
You rescued me, Lisey.

37:51.647 --> 37:54.191
Because she needs you. We both do.

37:54.274 --> 37:56.527
We love you, you troublesome old thing.

37:57.903 --> 38:00.113
Pull in, Lisey. Here, please.

38:00.197 --> 38:03.534
-Pull in, pull in. Lisey, pull in here.
-What? No. No. It's gonna rain a bitch.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.869
No, I want to watch the storm.

38:05.953 --> 38:08.288
-Pull over, please, Lisey. Please.
-Okay. Okay, okay.

38:09.581 --> 38:11.625
And I want you to tell me everything.

38:16.588 --> 38:17.881
Before the rain comes.

38:47.578 --> 38:49.872
So, do you understand everything
that I've told you?

38:51.415 --> 38:52.624
He's your basic loony.

38:53.292 --> 38:56.920
He's jealous of you, also hot for you.
What's not to understand?

38:57.004 --> 38:58.839
And you understand why
she can't go to the police, right?

38:58.922 --> 39:01.675
Yeah, I-- Yeah. I get it, I get it.
I have a gun.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.760
No, you don't have a gun
because Darla threw it in the river,

39:03.844 --> 39:05.804
-so you don't have a gun anymore.
-You are nuts, both of you.

39:05.888 --> 39:08.390
You want to call it Banella, you want to
call it Boolie Moon. It doesn't exist.

39:08.473 --> 39:12.769
-Darla, you saw me go there.
-I saw you regurgitate water in her mouth.

39:12.853 --> 39:14.897
Oh, is that it? That's it?
That's what you saw?

39:14.980 --> 39:16.231
-Stop, okay?
-No.

39:16.315 --> 39:18.692
No! He hurt me! He fucked with me!

39:18.775 --> 39:21.528
And the next time he fucks with me
is the last time he fucks with anybody.

39:21.612 --> 39:24.698
That's right. You were the steel in his
spine. Always, from the very beginning.

39:24.781 --> 39:27.159
Oh, Scott had plenty of spine.

39:27.242 --> 39:30.412
Yes, in his whole childhood, he used it
to get out of his childhood alive.

39:30.495 --> 39:32.623
What did he tell you, Amanda?
What did he tell you?

39:32.706 --> 39:34.625
-He could've killed me.
-Here comes the rain.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.376
-What?
-He could've killed me.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.295
It wasn't just the--

39:38.378 --> 39:41.507
the light was on or there were dishes
in your sink or the bed was unmade,

39:41.590 --> 39:43.133
there were crumbs every--

39:43.217 --> 39:45.427
There was food on your counter
'cause he was eating your food, Manda,

39:45.511 --> 39:46.762
like fuckin' Goldilocks.

39:46.845 --> 39:50.057
My house? He was in my house? He--

39:50.849 --> 39:52.392
-We have to kill him.
-And there was a smell.

39:52.476 --> 39:56.730
I don't know if it was his sweat or feet.
There was a smell and--

39:56.813 --> 39:59.066
Dooley was there.
He was there when I went to get the gun.

39:59.149 --> 40:02.736
Probably was there. He probably was there,
because he's a fucking idiot.

40:02.819 --> 40:04.321
I bet he was watching me the whole time.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.822
Either he was under the bed
or in the closet.

40:05.906 --> 40:06.990
We have to kill him.

40:07.074 --> 40:08.367
Amanda, Jesus!

40:11.662 --> 40:12.663
Damn it!

40:14.331 --> 40:15.332
Lisey.

40:16.166 --> 40:18.210
You think you could really kill him?

40:18.293 --> 40:19.294
Yes.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.672
And get rid of the body in that place?

40:23.090 --> 40:24.091
Yes!

40:24.174 --> 40:25.384
-Can I help?
-Yes!

40:25.968 --> 40:27.219
Yes!

40:27.302 --> 40:29.596
-Amanda!
-Yes! Yes.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.889
-Amanda!
-Amanda.

40:31.849 --> 40:33.267
Will you help us kill him?

40:33.892 --> 40:37.020
Yeah. I got no problem with killing him.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.189
Let's fucking kill him.

40:39.273 --> 40:41.650
-Let's fucking kill him!
-Fucking kill him!

40:41.733 --> 40:44.653
-Let's fucking kill him!
-Fucking kill him!

40:44.736 --> 40:49.449
Let's fucking kill him!

40:50.200 --> 40:52.661
-Yeah!
-Let's fucking kill him!

40:52.744 --> 40:55.706
Fuck yeah! Let's fucking kill him!

41:29.573 --> 41:33.076
Mr. Dooley, it's Lisey Landon. You win.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.578
You can have whatever you want.

41:35.329 --> 41:38.749
Meet me here at 10:00 p.m.
I won't call the police.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.544
Just don't hurt me anymore, please.

42:23.627 --> 42:24.795
Looks like you got caught out.

42:24.878 --> 42:28.632
Yeah, I did, and I enjoyed it too.
How are you?

42:28.715 --> 42:30.092
-Fine.
-Yeah?

42:30.175 --> 42:33.679
Chief Richards says that
this nonsense is about to be over.

42:33.762 --> 42:35.013
He spoke to the professor

42:35.097 --> 42:37.975
and he said that fella that
was stalking you has left the area.

42:39.268 --> 42:40.811
That's wonderful news.

42:40.894 --> 42:42.229
Yeah.

42:42.312 --> 42:43.856
But do you believe it?

42:49.862 --> 42:52.614
You're the one who always says
these guys are show and go, right?

42:53.282 --> 42:55.117
Yeah, but he could be playing us.

42:56.618 --> 42:59.079
Look, the station is
spread a little thin tonight.

42:59.162 --> 43:01.081
I-I don't mind sticking around.

43:02.541 --> 43:03.834
You should get some rest.

43:05.169 --> 43:08.797
All right. Well, you have my number
on speed dial, and the station too, yeah?

43:08.881 --> 43:11.300
Yeah. Well, I'll call you first
if anything happens, okay?

43:11.383 --> 43:12.676
-All right, that's a deal.
-Thanks.

43:12.759 --> 43:14.469
Now dry off. And you have a safe night.

43:18.974 --> 43:21.059
Told him I'd call him if I needed him.

43:39.870 --> 43:41.455
I hate to put you guys in danger.

43:41.538 --> 43:44.708
I think we'd be in less danger if Darla
hadn't thrown my gun in the river.

43:44.791 --> 43:48.504
Let's just forget the gun, okay?
We're clear on the plan, right?

43:48.587 --> 43:50.923
Yeah, he's not gonna be expecting
three against one.

43:51.006 --> 43:52.132
-No.
-Okay, yeah.

43:52.216 --> 43:54.384
The only thing, Lisey, is the,

43:54.468 --> 43:56.929
the path you want us to walk on
has got poison ivy on both sides.

43:57.012 --> 43:59.097
Oh, my God, then don't touch it.

43:59.723 --> 44:03.435
And just-- And bring her back to-- to
your house. Don't-- Don't go to Amanda's.

44:03.519 --> 44:05.103
Right. I'm not an idiot.

44:05.187 --> 44:06.522
And the diner downtown first.

44:06.605 --> 44:09.900
I want a cheeseburger and fries
the way I like them, burnt black.

44:09.983 --> 44:11.610
Yeah. I know how you like it.

44:12.528 --> 44:14.238
I know how you like it.

44:14.321 --> 44:15.781
What are you talking about?

44:15.864 --> 44:17.741
-Officer in uniform.
-Oh, my God.

44:17.824 --> 44:21.036
-You flirted with the cop.
-I did not! I--

44:30.003 --> 44:31.421
Don't make fun of me.

45:12.296 --> 45:13.547
He'll come.
