00:18.894 --> 00:20.705
Jeff, you haven't even looked
at the new course catalog.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.356
I'm like a kid in a candy store.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.084
Well, the candy has lost its appeal
now that I work at the store.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.361
You might say becoming a
teacher here gave me diabetes.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.737
I was just saying that!

00:29.029 --> 00:30.989
Are you always thirsty
and fatigued,

00:31.281 --> 00:33.259
and you have blurry vision,
and your cuts heal slower?

00:33.283 --> 00:35.035
Those are actual diabetes
symptoms.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.870
That's what the doctor said!

00:37.162 --> 00:38.330
So is he treating it?

00:38.622 --> 00:39.706
I asked him the same thing!

00:39.998 --> 00:41.291
What did he say?

00:41.583 --> 00:44.344
He said make an appointment through
his office, during business hours,

00:44.419 --> 00:46.059
this is his home,
his children sleep here.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.338
You know doctors.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.091
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.094
There's a class
called "Basic Grifting."

00:52.386 --> 00:55.055
Should we all learn how
to be grifters together?

00:55.347 --> 00:56.627
Wait, what do grifters do again?

00:56.723 --> 00:57.723
I got this.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.135
I'll tell you for five bucks.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.226
No.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.728
You better sign me up. Me too.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.248
I've always wanted
to learn more about grifting

01:03.272 --> 01:04.897
ever since I saw 1990's
The Grifters,

01:05.190 --> 01:07.335
featuring Jon Cusack, Anjelica
Huston, and almost no grifting.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.069
You guys, don't take
a grifting class.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.529
You're gonna get grifted.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.739
Even more so than
by that oceanography class,

01:13.031 --> 01:14.671
only none of you
will even get a goldfish.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.785
Then you're gonna come
crying back to me. Why you?

01:16.827 --> 01:18.245
Because, let's face it,

01:18.537 --> 01:21.177
I'm the closest thing that Greendale
has to an experienced grifter.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.250
Ohhh! This is
one of those things

01:23.542 --> 01:26.086
where Jeff gets jealous
of something dumb.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.171
Jeff's jealous of a grifter!

01:28.463 --> 01:30.132
Because he wishes
he was still a grifter!

01:32.551 --> 01:34.487
That's something even I can
mock, and I live in an RV.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.111
Yeah, I'm judging you, and my dinner
table folds down from a wall.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.141
I say we all take
the grifting class together,

01:39.433 --> 01:41.602
have a great time,
and rub it in Jeff's face.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.187
Who's in and can you cover me?
I'll pay you back.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.607
I'll get it from your parents.
I'll pay you back.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.578
At which point,
I'll pay back your parents.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.902
Which will be never!

01:51.194 --> 01:53.905
I will get a high five
from your parents.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.200
All right, each student should bring a
briefcase. I don't have a briefcase.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.932
We're going to grift
with briefcases?

01:58.994 --> 02:00.787
Basic my ass. That's advanced.
Mmm-hmm.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.279
I have a few extra briefcases.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.582
Shocker. Are they regulation?

02:03.874 --> 02:05.634
We each need a regulation
grifting briefcase.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.086
It's a grift. What's a
regulation briefcase?

02:08.377 --> 02:11.381
I don't know, but they're
provided for only $150.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.924
You're being grifted.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.302
Shut up, Jeff. You're
such a negative person.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.180
What do you contribute to this
group besides negativity?

02:18.472 --> 02:19.472
Guys, watch this.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.932
Can I borrow $150?

02:21.224 --> 02:22.224
- No.
- See!

02:22.351 --> 02:23.518
Now who's gonna come with me

02:23.810 --> 02:25.270
and show this guy what's up?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.606
I'll pay you back. I'll
get it from your parents.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.442
Tell them I spit on their
wealth, and thank you.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.818
Good morning.

03:13.110 --> 03:16.488
My name is Professor
Roger DeSalvo,

03:16.780 --> 03:17.864
for the time being.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.492
Oh. For I use many a pseudonym.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.785
Such as Jeff Goulash,

03:22.077 --> 03:24.121
Phillip Switch, or Baz Ravish.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.872
For I am a grifter,

03:26.164 --> 03:27.165
and this...

03:27.457 --> 03:28.667
is Grifting 101.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.091
Aw!

03:36.383 --> 03:39.636
Now which one of you thinks
I did that on purpose?

03:39.928 --> 03:40.928
Exactly...

03:41.138 --> 03:42.848
you think you've seen me fail.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.308
You think you've spotted
a weakness.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.760
Let me tell you something.
With the flick of a wrist...

03:47.936 --> 03:50.272
I could show you
a fool one minute...

03:52.274 --> 03:53.274
or longer.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.805
I see you've got
your briefcases.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.570
Excellent. Hold them aloft.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.198
Pass them to each other.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.620
Now, pass them back.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.582
Do it at speed.

04:08.874 --> 04:09.875
Quicker!

04:10.167 --> 04:12.335
Pass them like hell.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.421
Pass them
like your sister's dying.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.300
And continue that
for about 40 minutes.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.804
Wait, 40 minutes?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.015
What's your name, my love?
Annie Edison.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.642
That sounds like a real name,
not the name of a grifter,

04:27.934 --> 04:29.978
and, therefore, not a teacher.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.105
Ahem. What?

04:32.397 --> 04:33.677
My name is Slick Pockets Tucker.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.025
No, it's not. That's correct.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.627
I was just wondering
what the next lesson will be.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.613
The next lesson will be
passing two briefcases.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.073
But you need to master the art
of passing one.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.910
And then you can purchase
another briefcase.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.411
What? You talk too much.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.703
Keep passing.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.629
It's a very funny book.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.180
Oh, no, grifters.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.682
I better watch my
French fries, unless...

05:07.974 --> 05:09.476
Counterfeit?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.008
Where did you learn to do that?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.789
We didn't learn anything.
That class is...

05:12.813 --> 05:13.813
A rip-off?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.524
Hmm, what's another word
for that?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.960
All he did was throw his hat
and make us pass briefcases.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.378
And he kept trying
to sell us stuff.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.279
Briefcase swapping talcum
for "grifter's palm,"

05:21.571 --> 05:23.132
briefcase hinge oil
for "silent switcheroos,"

05:23.156 --> 05:24.991
and something called
"extra believable socks."

05:25.283 --> 05:26.451
Those are actually half off.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.063
I kind of feel
like I grifted him.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.538
So, in a sense,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.122
what happened is,

05:31.414 --> 05:33.291
you took a class
about grifting...

05:33.583 --> 05:35.293
and...

05:37.379 --> 05:40.257
Jeff, you really
need us to say it?

05:40.549 --> 05:41.989
You were... Bu... whoa...
whoa, whoa.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.885
Yeah, I need you to say it.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.345
Let me just get settled.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.473
Okay, go.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.893
You were right.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.063
Oh, yeah.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.982
Well, you live
and you learn, guys.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.400
Well, you live, anyway.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.026
So now will you please help us?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.153
Help you? ELROY:
We want revenge.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.197
We want to grift him back.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.008
You want to grift a grifter? That's
as dumb as taking his class.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.492
Just cut your losses.
But, Jeff...

06:07.784 --> 06:09.411
I begged you not to go
down this path,

06:09.703 --> 06:12.023
and you made fun of me. You
pointed at my face and laughed.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.540
We're sorry
we hurt your feelings.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.418
My feelings are fine.
I'm just very lazy,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.336
and you gave me
an excuse to do nothing.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.856
I'm not just gonna
throw that away.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.190
You don't want to
take this guy down?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.340
He's even lazier than you.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.926
Doesn't your species
consider that a challenge?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.596
Shouldn't you be having some
kind of reverse pissing contest

06:27.888 --> 06:29.264
to determine who's laziest?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.559
Is that where you suck it
back up in your...

06:32.851 --> 06:34.936
Ugh, I'm sorry. I've only
ever done it the other way.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.521
You mean peeing?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.648
No, I mean in the back.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.903
He hasn't done anything to me.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.714
In fact, he sounds
like a pretty good guy.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.364
I bet we'd get along.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.536
Good show. Good show.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.372
What show?

06:54.664 --> 06:55.707
I haven't seen that show.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.292
All right, all the best.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.836
And you are?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.339
Well, I was the guy
with a full bottle of scotch

07:02.631 --> 07:04.049
and a high tolerance
for foreigners.

07:05.926 --> 07:06.927
How robust.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.845
I imagine
that you're Jeff Winger?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.806
Turns out, we're going
to be office buddies.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.935
Hello there, sir.
My name is Roger DeSalvo.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.145
Or is it? You see,
I happen to be in the...

07:17.437 --> 07:19.522
Grifting 101. Yes,
I've heard about you.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.441
That would be your desk.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.193
If you need a mnemonic device,

07:23.485 --> 07:25.862
it's the one without someone
else's stuff all over it.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.154
Well played.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.615
Very well played.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.283
I got to say...

07:32.077 --> 07:33.453
I admire your style.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.956
Grifting people by selling
them grifting lessons?

07:36.247 --> 07:37.958
That's genius. But I called it.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.793
I never said
my class was a grift.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.711
Don't worry about me,
I'm one of you.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.880
Was, anyway. Do tell.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.800
Well, I worked at one of the
top law firms in the city...

07:47.092 --> 07:48.092
as a lawyer.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.469
But guess what?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.554
I'm not a lawyer.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.057
I think you're talking
about lying.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.976
Grifting happens to be
an art form.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.477
The art of lying.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.313
Let's not get high handed,
grifting is lying.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.816
Okay, so,
like a string is a sweater.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.609
Like paint
is the Sistine Chapel.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.987
Sure, grifting includes lying.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.918
But only a liar
would call grifting lying.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.825
And only a delusional hobo
would glorify stealing.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.095
Really, did you say something
that wasn't true there?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.399
Maybe we should phone
the museum?

08:15.453 --> 08:17.622
I was on your side.
You're an ass.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.166
Well, you're a craftless,
artless thug.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.626
And I'm God's paintbrush.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.003
No, I am God.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.088
Which pretty much
makes me better than you.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.885
You know what?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.721
Let's agree to disagree.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.140
It's not important.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.476
Oh, okay, so you can lie.
Yeah, you liar.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.936
Yeah.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.109
I want to speak to you,
you son of a bitch.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.401
What?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.612
I love you.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.742
I do too.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.037
Good.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.543
Why are you guys
still doing that?

09:03.835 --> 09:06.004
Well, it was homework.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.672
And we're getting better, right?

09:07.964 --> 09:09.400
Or the friction has
gradually melted the handle

09:09.424 --> 09:10.675
to fit into our palms.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.178
There's nothing to get better at.
The class is a grift.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.638
The next person who says
grift is gonna... grift.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.557
My God, now it's replacing
other words.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.142
All right, I'm in.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.811
Let's grift the son of a bitch.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.860
Why are you cheering? He... he
could be saying anything.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.112
Grift, grift, grift,

09:31.404 --> 09:35.325
grift, grift, grift, grift,
grift, grift, grift, grift!

09:55.678 --> 09:57.931
Good work.
I can't remember your name.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.517
Likewise, no idea what your name is.
Great job.

10:00.809 --> 10:01.809
All right.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.061
I'd say you're...

10:03.353 --> 10:05.522
pretty close to swapping
with briefcases

10:05.814 --> 10:07.690
loaded with actual fake money,

10:07.982 --> 10:09.526
such as this.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.505
This isn't real money, it's just cut
up newspaper, but it weighs the same.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.780
Costs $5 apiece.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.241
You'll be using 10.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.535
Telegram for Elroy Patashnik!

10:18.827 --> 10:19.994
I'm Patashnik.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.704
Telegram, sir.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.208
Oh, my God. My Aunt Baba...

10:25.500 --> 10:26.780
died on vacation
while in Africa.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.961
Oh.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.671
But she left me
a million dollars.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.215
But the African government
wants to seize the funds.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.507
Class dismissed.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.177
Not you.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.561
Are you out of your mind? What?

10:44.853 --> 10:46.146
The African Telegram.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.730
The Jim Belushi of grifts.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.399
Are you trying to grift me?

10:49.691 --> 10:50.900
I'll cut you in for 14 grand.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
Get out.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.445
Out!

10:57.615 --> 10:58.700
One more thing.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.245
Nice try twice.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.747
Twice? The fake grift
within the grift.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.319
Or the double bean, if you like.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.583
I'm gonna mention a name,

11:07.792 --> 11:10.378
and however you react,
I'll know the truth.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.215
Jeff Winger.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.827
That's the one.
Who's Jeff Winger?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.050
Who?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.177
That's the one.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.596
Out you go.

11:19.888 --> 11:20.888
Say hi to him.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.018
By the way, Jeff Winger...

11:26.603 --> 11:28.479
nice try thrice.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.233
Hey.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.611
How was grifting class?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.543
Did you teach
advanced grifting techniques

11:36.779 --> 11:39.032
only you could understand...
the Brown Betty?

11:39.324 --> 11:41.284
The Texas Well Baby?
The Reverse Jim Gaffigan?

11:41.576 --> 11:44.245
Well, I wouldn't teach
the African Telegram,

11:44.537 --> 11:45.914
since I'm not a hack.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.124
And also since the internet.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.543
Okay, you caught me. Game over.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.920
Let's end this competition.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.296
Cheers to that.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.931
Uh, sir, you...

12:03.223 --> 12:05.023
That guy left his
lottery ticket on the table.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
That was the Telegram man.
No, it wasn't.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.394
I mean, what telegram?

12:08.686 --> 12:11.314
Exactly. What telegram?
Because the internet.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.234
You know, that place
that you obviously went

12:14.525 --> 12:16.778
to type in the word "grifting".

12:17.070 --> 12:19.530
I'm gonna grift you.
I'm gonna grift your ass.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.699
Or is that the grift?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.952
None of it's a grift.
It's all nonsense.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.622
Okay, how many times
have I told you people

12:27.914 --> 12:29.916
the faculty lounge is not a bar?

12:30.208 --> 12:32.335
All right, pack it up,
people. Come on.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.213
You don't have to go teach a
class, but you can't stay here.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.132
Look. Truce, okay?

12:38.424 --> 12:39.634
Promise no more grifting,

12:39.926 --> 12:43.012
and promise
if this is worth a million,

12:43.304 --> 12:45.974
we'll split it. You're an idiot.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.517
Or maybe I'm a genius?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.769
No, I can answer that.
You're definitely an idiot.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.122
Can an idiot walk backwards
like this and not hit anything?

12:52.146 --> 12:53.147
Maybe.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.191
Or maybe not.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.987
Psst. What?

13:07.078 --> 13:08.746
What are you doing here?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.707
This guy is a grifter!

13:10.999 --> 13:12.250
Professor of grifting.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.086
He charges $400,
you get two briefcases,

13:15.378 --> 13:18.506
and your ex-boyfriend
becomes an obsessive...

13:18.798 --> 13:21.426
I didn't know you and
Winger were lovers.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.958
If he wanted my respect, he
should have opened with that.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.388
Are you trying to be disarming?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.849
Are you grifting me
out of my arms?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.517
I did nothing to that man.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.453
He called himself a grifter.
I just simply corrected him.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.565
Yeah, because the truth is so
important to the both of you.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.526
So what's it gonna cost
to make you go away?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.199
Well?

13:47.785 --> 13:48.785
He took the bait.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.121
Yes!

13:50.413 --> 13:52.099
Wait, I thought we didn't
want him to take the bait.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.403
No, we're saying the same thing.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.384
He didn't take the bait
we didn't want taken.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.086
The African Telegram.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.423
Yeah, which was offered
as fake bait

14:00.715 --> 14:02.884
and taken as such,
i.e., not taken.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.094
Because that made him
feel in control.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.013
And by avoiding
all visible bait,

14:07.305 --> 14:08.825
he placed himself
on the invisible hook

14:08.931 --> 14:10.451
of assuming
we're planning to grift him.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.268
Oh, I like it. Oh, yeah.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.896
But we are.
So he knows the truth.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.428
Isn't that, like, the one thing

14:16.689 --> 14:18.809
you're not supposed to know
when you're being grifted?

14:19.609 --> 14:20.693
Hmm.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.696
He can know a plan all he wants.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.032
But the plan he knows
won't be our plan.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.117
Ooh. Okay.

14:28.409 --> 14:32.830
Because our plan
is impossible to know?

14:33.915 --> 14:35.166
Because...

14:37.293 --> 14:38.795
Oh, my God!

14:39.087 --> 14:41.047
Jeff is making this up as we go.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.258
Shh. Just knock it off.
What do you want from me?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.219
We wanted you to help
us do a grift.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.679
I'm working on it!
Improvisationally?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.115
They definitely
had a plan in The Sting.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.259
If anyone wants to watch it,

14:51.516 --> 14:53.077
it's important you know it
knocks out half a calendar day.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.727
Look, do you guys remember

14:55.019 --> 14:56.872
when we hugged and jumped
up and down in the cafeteria?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.106
Yeah. Obviously.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.899
Well, having been together

15:00.191 --> 15:01.692
virtually non-stop ever since,

15:01.984 --> 15:04.487
at what point do you think I
slipped off with pen and paper

15:04.779 --> 15:08.032
and planned an entire grift,
then withheld it from you?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.952
I guess at any
of the several dozen points

15:11.244 --> 15:12.912
when a normal person would say,

15:13.204 --> 15:14.997
"By the way, I have no plan."

15:15.289 --> 15:17.309
In The Sting, they do withhold
stuff from each other.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.019
Or from the audience,
but I think for effect.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.671
Also be warned, 20% of
the movie is hand drawn.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.464
Abed, why don't you
marry The Sting?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.818
Okay, just so you know, if I do
and we have half Sting children,

15:25.842 --> 15:27.194
when they ask me how to
grift, I'm gonna tell them

15:27.218 --> 15:28.818
to watch their mother,
not listen to you!

15:28.845 --> 15:29.988
Yeah! ANNIE: You suck with this.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.031
You are unbelievable!
Bad stinger!

15:31.055 --> 15:32.890
Shut up, okay?

15:33.182 --> 15:36.352
You guys... you're... you're
always picking on me, all right?

15:36.644 --> 15:38.104
Aw!

15:38.396 --> 15:39.748
And you've really been
hammering me lately.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.775
All I had was the idea that...

15:44.777 --> 15:47.029
Look... look, I... I need this.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.449
I need to be
better than this guy.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.243
So let me think.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.582
Abed. Yeah?

15:57.874 --> 15:59.554
Did you bring your laptop?
Yes, right here.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.367
What do you want to do with it?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.256
Watch The Sting.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.597
It's over.

16:12.889 --> 16:13.890
What happened?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.224
Who got shot?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.685
What's going on?
Was Sting even in it?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.937
That movie was terrible.
You slept the whole time.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.166
Yeah, that's worse, The
dialogue seeped in my dreams.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.608
My whole brain
is long and quiet.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.277
So how did they grift him?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.946
Well, they basically
made a fake building

16:29.238 --> 16:31.991
and hired a thousand people to
cooperate in perfect secrecy.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.284
Huh.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.619
Should we just do that?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.351
We could watch
another grifter movie.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.931
There's more activity
in Matchstick Men.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.332
Oh, like what?

16:39.624 --> 16:40.124
At one point, they
build a fake hospital.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.460
So much construction!

16:42.752 --> 16:44.629
Oh, God. It's so late.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.020
You guys are gonna
bail on me, aren't you?

16:48.299 --> 16:49.425
I think we have to, Jeff.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.177
We've tried everything we can.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.513
Maybe over the weekend,
I can make a fake building,

16:53.804 --> 16:55.389
but all the briefcases
and the swapping

16:55.681 --> 16:57.600
and The Sting,
I'm not cut out for it.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.370
I'm starting to think that real grifts
only really happen in the movies.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.039
And even in the movies,
they barely make sense.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.063
Look, I'm old.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.107
The Sting is terrible.
Grifting is stupid.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.733
The writing's on the wall.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.026
So that's it.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.392
There's no shame in this, Jeff.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.571
Oh, I don't know about that.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.617
Well, this is a scene to behold.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.994
Huddled in the closet, watching
The Sting like gypsies.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.622
Roger.

17:19.914 --> 17:20.998
We surrender.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.458
You were right,

17:22.750 --> 17:23.834
I'm no grifter.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.337
No, I was wrong.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.965
If you remember,
I called you a thug.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.967
Thugs fight.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.094
You're more...

17:33.928 --> 17:35.471
Nope.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.975
I can't think of a metaphor pathetic
enough to suit you, Jeff Winger.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.561
Though I am reminded of
something Oscar Wilde once said

17:41.852 --> 17:44.772
when he compared sheep to wolves.
Screw it.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.275
Britta!

17:49.652 --> 17:50.652
You hit me!

17:50.820 --> 17:52.196
With a woman's hand!

17:52.488 --> 17:54.156
You Midwestern floozy!

17:54.448 --> 17:55.491
I lived in New York!

17:55.783 --> 17:56.783
Ahh!

18:12.883 --> 18:13.883
Oh.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.686
Yeah, right, he's grifting us.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.648
Grift blood.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.940
Someone taste it,

18:29.066 --> 18:30.818
I'm sure it's Karo syrup
and food dye.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.945
I mean, I would,
but my diabetes.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.999
19, 20,

18:45.291 --> 18:46.375
21.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.794
Are you counting
the amount of money

18:49.086 --> 18:50.880
or the number of stacks?

18:52.214 --> 18:53.466
Um.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.384
I have to start over.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.346
I'll do it. Move.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.972
But I want to go on record

19:00.264 --> 19:03.559
as being disgusted
by this transaction.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.436
Got it. "Disgusted."

19:05.728 --> 19:06.979
I'm sorry, love,

19:07.271 --> 19:08.951
but would you rather
we took this to court?

19:09.106 --> 19:11.859
No, no, no, no, no. We appreciate
you keeping this between us,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.231
and I do want to remind you

19:13.486 --> 19:14.695
that we offer a lot of classes

19:14.987 --> 19:16.227
and many of them are cash only.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.823
Me, take a class here?

19:18.115 --> 19:19.367
Talk about a rip-off.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.121
Talk about a ribbing.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.706
What the hell am I doing?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.041
You know, so far,

19:27.333 --> 19:28.668
Frankie's disgusted

19:28.959 --> 19:30.086
and, uh, that's it.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.254
Seems like a waste of a record.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.424
- I'm so sorry, guys. This is all my fault.
- Don't be...

19:35.716 --> 19:38.511
I'm the one who got into a pissing match...
with a jerk.

19:38.803 --> 19:39.803
You're a jerk.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.514
You're a jerk. You're a jerk.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.015
You're all jerks.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.393
And this whole school
can suck a big one.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.895
And you can put
that in your record.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.022
I'm sorry, guys.
I'm bound by my station.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.732
Speaking on that topic, Britta,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.402
this is all your fault,
and you're expelled.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.570
No, Dean. Let... let
me handle this.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.073
Pelton, you can't do that.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.658
Britta's the heart
of this group.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.535
She started it.

20:02.827 --> 20:06.747
As a fake biology group,

20:07.039 --> 20:08.499
so that she could have sex with,

20:08.791 --> 20:10.167
uh, Troy.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.961
No, no, no. That's exactly it.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.796
Okay. No, let me handle it.
No, no, no.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.548
No. ANNIE: You can't
expel Britta.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.341
She's been here six years.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.552
Three more, and she'll
have her two-year degree.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.244
Britta keeps me grounded
in reality.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.072
You can't expel her with four
week-isodes left in a seaso-meeter.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.184
See, it's starting. It's okay, guys.
It's okay.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.854
All right.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.606
And I'll just put this in here.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.527
- Give it to me.
- Yep.

20:36.819 --> 20:37.987
Don't help me, anyone.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.157
Turn me around.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.463
Hey?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.929
The plan was to meet later.

21:05.306 --> 21:08.559
So what's it gonna cost
to make you go away?

21:08.851 --> 21:11.103
You know, there's a way we
could end this very quickly,

21:11.395 --> 21:12.395
and make a bit of money.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.564
I don't like it.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.441
But keep talking.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.942
Yes, that was the plan.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.195
And your plan was probably
to never show up.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.571
Clever girl.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.406
Don't trust anyone.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.045
Hang on, did you
have to hit me for real?

21:36.337 --> 21:37.630
Have to? No.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.132
Now that you're expelled,

21:40.424 --> 21:42.635
you might consider
a career in grifting.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.929
You're quite good at it.
I don't know.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.014
How does one go through
life like that?

21:48.474 --> 21:49.600
Well...

21:50.893 --> 21:52.186
follow me and I'll show you.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.396
Oh, shut up.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.860
I only agreed to any of this

22:00.152 --> 22:01.445
to get you away from Greendale

22:01.737 --> 22:03.113
and out of Jeff's hair.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.949
He's an idiot,
but I hate watching him

22:05.241 --> 22:06.408
spin out trying to beat you.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.078
Oh, you sentimental fool. No.

22:09.954 --> 22:10.996
Later.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.623
At the motel.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.750
The motel, hmm.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.171
♪ Some say I'm a lucky grifter

22:19.463 --> 22:22.591
♪ Some say I'm the King.

22:22.883 --> 22:26.679
♪ They call me the lucky grifter

22:26.971 --> 22:29.974
♪ They call me
the King of England

22:30.266 --> 22:31.600
♪ And the King ♪

22:36.605 --> 22:37.773
No.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.195
What the hell?

22:43.487 --> 22:44.572
Oh, shut up.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.287
The only reason I
agreed to any of this

22:51.579 --> 22:53.831
was to get you away from
Greendale

22:54.123 --> 22:55.249
and out of Jeff's hair.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.043
What the...

23:00.337 --> 23:02.089
You two! Come back here!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.050
Briefcases,

23:06.218 --> 23:07.553
coming right through.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.346
Identical briefcases.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.557
What? Why more briefcases?

23:14.101 --> 23:15.477
This is pointless.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.314
I already know
she's got my briefcase.

23:20.691 --> 23:21.901
Briefcase parade.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.611
Who the hell are you?

23:26.363 --> 23:28.198
You get back here.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.451
You get back here with my money.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.077
Get back here!

23:48.385 --> 23:49.511
Oh...

23:49.803 --> 23:51.138
Roger. They stole my money.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.515
What? Those briefcases
contain my money.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.684
They stole $50,000 from me.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.020
50 grand, huh?

23:58.312 --> 24:00.512
You guys know what he's talking about?
I don't think so.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.691
These are our briefcases.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.961
We're in his grifting class.
He sells these supplies.

24:04.985 --> 24:05.985
150 bucks.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.613
Really, a hun... okay.

24:07.905 --> 24:08.905
We are still rolling.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.825
We got pretty good at it too.
Check it out.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.117
Ow. Ow, sorry.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.243
Sorry, got it. Okay.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.583
Roger, why were you walking
around with $50,000?

24:20.751 --> 24:21.877
Are you mental?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.379
Hey. Whoa, pal.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.172
That usage may fly in the UK.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.548
Not in the States.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.593
I have a mentally challenged
cousin.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.553
Sister. Pics...

24:31.845 --> 24:33.239
- I want to see pics.
- Okay, me too.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.556
You know very well...

24:34.848 --> 24:36.100
that this school paid me

24:36.392 --> 24:39.561
$50,000 in cash
for these injuries.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.493
Well, you seem to be
in pretty good shape.

24:41.772 --> 24:44.692
Oh, my God.
Look at the two of you.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.944
Yeah, he's the reason
I became a cop.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.530
You know,
a lot of bullies out there.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.073
There are a million...

24:51.365 --> 24:53.283
witnesses to this.
Hey, everyone.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.828
Hey, guys. Hanging
out in the cafeteria?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.371
Hi, Professor.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.540
What happened to your face?
This is ridiculous.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.584
Oh, she's beautiful. You
could be twins.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.586
So the statement
I'm hearing here is,

25:04.878 --> 25:06.130
you're a grifting Professor.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.302
Yeah. You're teaching these
people how to grift,

25:08.590 --> 25:11.051
but you're saying
they grifted you?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.595
No, you... I'm not saying that!

25:13.887 --> 25:15.556
They didn't grift me.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.391
What they do is not grifting.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.411
They wouldn't even understand
what the word meant.

25:19.435 --> 25:23.605
I think we need to take what
Roger's saying more seriously.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.317
Because it sounds like...

25:27.609 --> 25:28.777
he was either the victim

25:29.069 --> 25:30.904
of crass, artless thuggery...

25:31.196 --> 25:32.573
Correct. In which case...

25:32.865 --> 25:35.784
there really is $50,000
floating around

25:36.076 --> 25:39.246
that he was given
for clearly fake injuries

25:39.538 --> 25:42.249
and that he, therefore,
now owes the school...

25:42.541 --> 25:43.541
What?

25:43.625 --> 25:47.713
Or Professor DeSalvo
was targeted...

25:48.005 --> 25:50.424
by a group of people
he vastly underestimated,

25:50.716 --> 25:54.428
in which case, the money was
given and then taken back,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.597
and nobody owes anybody
anything.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.766
All he would have to do

25:59.058 --> 26:00.893
is admit...

26:06.315 --> 26:07.566
I was grifted.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.946
Grift, grift, grift, grift,

26:13.238 --> 26:15.282
grift, grift, grift, grift!

26:15.574 --> 26:17.618
Why are you even here?
Who called you?

26:17.910 --> 26:18.910
Nobody.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.746
I take macrame after work.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.038
They know that.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.332
Sorry you got grifted.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.709
Let me know if you want to
press charges, and, uh,

26:26.001 --> 26:27.961
if you can think
of what those would be.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.506
Professor DeSalvo,
under the circumstances,

26:30.798 --> 26:32.508
I'm sure you agree
it doesn't make sense

26:32.800 --> 26:34.760
for you to keep
teaching this subject here.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.136
Yeah, I mean...

26:36.428 --> 26:38.148
we kind of know
everything there is to know.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.148
You should probably
refund all of their money

26:40.265 --> 26:42.351
and we should all go
get some hot dogs!

26:42.643 --> 26:43.852
Hot dogs!

26:44.144 --> 26:48.440
Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs,
hot dogs, hot dogs,

26:48.732 --> 26:53.904
hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs,
hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs,

26:54.196 --> 26:55.447
hot dogs...

26:55.739 --> 26:57.449
We were all in on it
the whole time?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.785
You weren't.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.913
Because I can't be trusted!

27:03.205 --> 27:05.165
Hot dogs, hot dogs!

27:12.339 --> 27:13.799
Telegram for Mr. Winger.
Hey, Ridley.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.051
So I returned the telegram
man outfit to the Dean.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.803
Oh, thank you so much.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.415
I know how crazy
this week's been.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.916
You really didn't have
to do this.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.307
Are you kidding? I owe you.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.560
Whatever you need, just say the word.
All right.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.563
I could use your help moving
a mattress this weekend.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.315
Okay, cool. Is that okay?

27:30.607 --> 27:31.859
Let me know.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.904
My name is Ryan Ridley.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.031
Three years ago,
my life was saved

27:38.323 --> 27:39.700
by a stranger at my gym.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.785
I felt like I owed him my life.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.079
Apparently, he agreed.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.622
Now he has me do things.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.749
And I keep hoping
and praying that one day,

27:48.041 --> 27:50.919
I'll do enough
for him to call us even.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.214
Until then, I'm just
a guy from his gym.
