WEBVTT

00:04.217 --> 00:06.043
I'm telling you Pluto
ain't a planet.

00:06.086 --> 00:07.652
Since when?

00:07.695 --> 00:09.695
Since the IAU said so.

00:09.739 --> 00:11.782
The who?

00:11.826 --> 00:13.782
A bunch of pencil necks
who make the rules.

00:13.826 --> 00:15.782
They don't make
the rules for me.

00:15.826 --> 00:17.652
I'm going with "planet."

00:17.695 --> 00:19.347
Speaking of pencil necks,

00:19.391 --> 00:22.217
somebody's got
an eyeball on you.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.086
See if he knows
what the IAU is.

00:38.521 --> 00:40.913
Looking for some fun?

00:40.956 --> 00:43.260
That works.

00:56.869 --> 00:59.434
You're late!

00:59.478 --> 01:01.739
But before we go anywhere,

01:01.782 --> 01:04.565
I need to know
you can protect me.

01:04.608 --> 01:06.260
And my family.

01:06.304 --> 01:07.869
You're safe now.

01:07.913 --> 01:10.565
I'll make sure your
family is, too.

01:10.608 --> 01:12.086
You don't know these people!

01:12.130 --> 01:14.043
You don't know
what they can do!

01:14.086 --> 01:16.043
Oh, yeah, we do.

01:16.086 --> 01:18.565
That's why I'm here.

01:18.608 --> 01:21.173
Trust me.

01:21.217 --> 01:23.217
You're safe.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.565
Great. Thank you.

02:20.521 --> 02:23.695
Well, boss, girls say
that, uh, the shooter

02:23.739 --> 02:25.086
was someone in a black SUV.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.478
They get a look
at the driver?

02:26.521 --> 02:27.869
If they did,
they're not saying.

02:27.913 --> 02:29.521
I think they're scared.

02:29.565 --> 02:30.608
Here you go.

02:30.652 --> 02:32.217
Keep the change.

02:32.260 --> 02:33.565
Somebody saw something, McGee.

02:33.608 --> 02:36.608
Take DiNozzo,
canvass the area.

02:36.652 --> 02:38.521
Uh, boss, DiNozzo isn't
here today, remember?

02:38.565 --> 02:41.869
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

02:41.913 --> 02:43.608
Ooh-yah!

02:43.652 --> 02:45.695
Thought you were in
Atlantic City with your buddies.

02:45.739 --> 02:47.347
Well, my flight doesn't
leave until 2:00.

02:47.391 --> 02:49.043
Gibbs asked me to
help out till then.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.739
Clearly, he didn't think you
could handle it by yourself.

02:50.782 --> 02:52.521
Let me get my jacket.

02:52.565 --> 02:55.130
Oh, please.
Like he actually said that.

02:55.173 --> 02:57.565
Wait, did he actually say that?Oh, thank you.

02:57.608 --> 03:01.217
Not only is prostitution
humanity's oldest profession,

03:01.260 --> 03:04.391
there is also evidence that
animals engage in it, too.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.130
For example, the
Antarctic penguin...

03:07.173 --> 03:10.000
Stilettos must be
murder on the ice.

03:10.043 --> 03:11.739
[laughs]

03:11.782 --> 03:13.173
That was a joke.

03:13.217 --> 03:15.173
No, that was an
attempt at a joke.

03:15.217 --> 03:17.521
Good morning, Eleanor!

03:17.565 --> 03:20.043
Uh, to whom do we have
the pleasure?

03:20.086 --> 03:21.521
Good morning, Ducky.

03:21.565 --> 03:22.956
Well...

03:23.000 --> 03:24.478
all we have

03:24.521 --> 03:25.695
is Lolita

03:25.739 --> 03:27.347
for the female victim.

03:27.391 --> 03:28.739
And the male is

03:28.782 --> 03:30.043
Petty Officer 2nd Class

03:30.086 --> 03:31.304
Daniel Harvey.

03:31.347 --> 03:33.260
Notify his commanding officer.

03:33.304 --> 03:34.695
On it.

03:34.739 --> 03:37.043
The gunfire appears
to have been

03:37.086 --> 03:38.478
concentrated on the female.

03:38.521 --> 03:42.173
But I'll have an accurate idea

03:42.217 --> 03:44.956
when you're done
with Agent McGee.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.304
Huh?

03:47.347 --> 03:49.086
He's lurking behind you.

03:51.521 --> 03:53.478
Hey, boss.

03:53.521 --> 03:55.304
What?

03:55.347 --> 03:56.826
Well, I was, uh,
I was just thinking,

03:56.869 --> 03:58.956
you know, Tony's really excited

03:59.000 --> 04:00.913
about having the week off.
Bishop and I can handle things

04:00.956 --> 04:02.043
just...We have a problem.

04:02.086 --> 04:03.695
...fine?

04:03.739 --> 04:05.478
What's the problem?

04:05.521 --> 04:07.130
I checked the Navy Locator.

04:07.173 --> 04:09.739
There's no listing for
a Petty Officer Daniel Harvey

04:09.782 --> 04:12.043
anywhere in the Navy's record.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.782
Someone needs to tell him that.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.565
Abby examined the I.D.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.608
If it's a forgery,
it's a really good one.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.739
And no hits on his prints.

04:24.782 --> 04:26.217
Vehicle's legit--
it's registered

04:26.260 --> 04:28.043
to the Department
of Defense's motor pool.

04:28.086 --> 04:30.130
Who checked it out?According to their records,

04:30.173 --> 04:32.086
it's still sitting
in the garage.

04:32.130 --> 04:34.217
There is an exit log at the
guard station we could look at.

04:34.260 --> 04:36.739
I can handle that.

04:36.782 --> 04:37.913
I mean, I can access that--

04:37.956 --> 04:39.173
right here, right now,
in the database.

04:41.086 --> 04:42.565
I'm gonna do that.

04:42.608 --> 04:44.043
The girl.

04:44.086 --> 04:47.043
Uh, Lolita Cortes, 21.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.913
Born in Colombia, but emigrated
to the U.S. when she was 18.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.043
ICE has her coming back from
a trip to Colombia last night.

04:52.086 --> 04:54.000
She was there for two days.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.956
That's a long trip
for just two days.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.478
Does she have a record?

04:57.521 --> 04:59.478
She was arrested twice
for prostitution.

04:59.521 --> 05:01.130
One of her coworkers said she
had a falling out with her pimp.

05:01.173 --> 05:03.173
If I didn't have a plane
to catch for a trip I'd been

05:03.217 --> 05:05.043
forward to for the last six
months, that's the first place

05:05.086 --> 05:07.043
I'd be looking-- hint, hint.Go, go, go, go.

05:07.086 --> 05:08.478
Going, gone!

05:08.521 --> 05:10.565
Have fun!Found something.

05:10.608 --> 05:12.043
And I'm sure it's gonna be
very compelling!

05:12.086 --> 05:14.521
Text me, McGee.
Let me know who the bad guy is.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.043
Found a requisition
for the car

05:16.086 --> 05:17.782
in a DoD motor pool database

05:17.826 --> 05:20.521
that I do not have access to,
but I accessed anyway.

05:20.565 --> 05:23.173
Uh, car was
requisitioned to an op

05:23.217 --> 05:26.000
called Lex... Talionis?

05:38.086 --> 05:39.043
Uh...

05:39.086 --> 05:40.826
what just happened?

05:40.869 --> 05:42.043
I have no idea.Huh.

05:42.086 --> 05:43.739
Let's go find out.

05:43.782 --> 05:45.869
You know what Lex Talionisis?

05:45.913 --> 05:46.956
I know the phrase-- Latin.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
It means, uh,
law of retaliation;

05:50.043 --> 05:51.521
eye for an eye;
that kind of thing.

05:51.565 --> 05:53.478
Oh, you ever heard of
an op with that name?

05:53.521 --> 05:55.521
No.

06:10.652 --> 06:12.608
I'm locked out!

06:12.652 --> 06:14.043
What the hell's going on?

06:14.086 --> 06:16.043
I don't know.

06:24.086 --> 06:26.347
Agent Gibbs, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:26.391 --> 06:28.652
We got a dead petty
officer driving

06:28.695 --> 06:30.739
a vehicle assigned
to Lex Talionis.

06:30.782 --> 06:31.695
That's our op.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.565
Why is there
operational activity

06:33.608 --> 06:35.608
that my agents
aren't aware of?

06:35.652 --> 06:37.565
Director Vance, if there's
Lex Talionisactivity

06:37.608 --> 06:40.130
in the field, then I'm
not aware of it, either.

06:40.173 --> 06:42.478
Which isn't unusual.

06:42.521 --> 06:44.565
You do recall this is a highly
compartmentalized operation.

06:44.608 --> 06:46.695
Are you in charge or not?

06:46.739 --> 06:48.565
I understand your frustration.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.260
I know you've been working
on this for years.

06:50.304 --> 06:51.565
So let's focus.

06:51.608 --> 06:54.086
Where was the petty
officer assigned?

06:54.130 --> 06:55.782
We're still looking.He had Navy I.D.

06:55.826 --> 06:57.739
But there's no record of
him in any Navy database.

06:57.782 --> 06:59.565
Might be a cover.

06:59.608 --> 07:01.652
Could we have
some kind of a leak?

07:01.695 --> 07:04.130
Well, if there is and the target
finds out we're after him,

07:04.173 --> 07:05.826
he'll go even
deeper underground.

07:05.869 --> 07:08.652
And we lose the best shot we've
had at finding him in years.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.434
Understood. Do your thing.

07:10.478 --> 07:12.478
I'll see what I can
find out on my end.

07:12.521 --> 07:15.173
Get me Carschenk
at Naval Intelligence.

07:15.217 --> 07:18.608
And Ambassador Edmunds at State.

07:18.652 --> 07:20.826
Agent Gibbs,
I think it's time to bring in

07:20.869 --> 07:22.869
the rest of your team.

07:27.695 --> 07:29.347
So what exactly
are we looking at?

07:29.391 --> 07:32.652
Metropolitan
International Airport.

07:32.695 --> 07:34.260
1979.

07:34.304 --> 07:36.434
Someone detonated a bomb
in the departure terminal.

07:36.478 --> 07:39.043
I know this.
At the time, it was

07:39.086 --> 07:41.260
one of the deadliest attacks
on American soil in decades.

07:41.304 --> 07:43.347
Almost a hundred people
injured or killed.

07:43.391 --> 07:44.521
Who did it?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.478
Nobody knows.

07:46.521 --> 07:47.521
VANCE: Case went cold
and the attack was

07:47.565 --> 07:49.521
all but forgotten by the public.

07:49.565 --> 07:52.347
But we... are not the public.

07:52.391 --> 07:56.043
And the United States of America
doesn't forget.

07:56.086 --> 07:59.043
You got a lead.

07:59.086 --> 08:00.739
After almost 40 years,
you got a lead.

08:02.173 --> 08:04.043
Two years ago,

08:04.086 --> 08:06.043
NCIS agents in Colombia

08:06.086 --> 08:08.391
recovered an unexploded bomb

08:08.434 --> 08:09.695
with a striking similarity

08:09.739 --> 08:12.826
to the one used
at Metropolitan Airport in '79.

08:12.869 --> 08:15.521
Touch DNA of the internal
components confirmed

08:15.565 --> 08:18.391
that both bombs were made
by the same bomb maker.

08:18.434 --> 08:19.782
Wow.

08:19.826 --> 08:21.347
Tony, how exactly

08:21.391 --> 08:22.869
do you know all this
and I don't?

08:22.913 --> 08:25.652
Admiral Tyson immediately
classified the intel

08:25.695 --> 08:28.391
and created a secret op
to track down the bomb maker.

08:28.434 --> 08:31.608
And she named the operation
Lex Talionis.

08:31.652 --> 08:33.565
Agent Gibbs was placed in charge

08:33.608 --> 08:35.478
because of his prior
experience in Colombia.

08:35.521 --> 08:38.608
And he brought Tony in,
and not me.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.565
Or me.

08:40.608 --> 08:43.260
Actually you weren't here yet,
Ziva was.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.478
Oh, come on, you're telling me
that Ziva knew, too?

08:45.521 --> 08:48.739
Agent McGee, your ego is not
the subject of this briefing.

08:48.782 --> 08:51.000
So, who is the subject?

08:53.434 --> 08:55.304
Tomás Orlando...

08:55.347 --> 08:57.565
62.

08:57.608 --> 08:59.608
He was formerly a
Colombian rebel, now he's

08:59.652 --> 09:02.652
one of the country's
biggest drug kingpins.

09:02.695 --> 09:03.826
We narrowed the
suspect pool down

09:03.869 --> 09:05.347
to Orlando about
six months ago.

09:05.391 --> 09:06.478
How?

09:06.521 --> 09:07.782
Well, it's a
long story, Bishop.

09:07.826 --> 09:08.869
Read up.

09:08.913 --> 09:10.260
For the past six months,

09:10.304 --> 09:11.782
we've tried to get a DNA sample

09:11.826 --> 09:13.782
from Orlando to confirm
that he's our guy.

09:13.826 --> 09:14.956
He's not an easy man to find.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.521
We've been dead in the water.

09:16.565 --> 09:18.217
Until today?

09:18.260 --> 09:19.565
That's what you need
to find out.

09:19.608 --> 09:21.304
Whatever's going on
with that petty officer,

09:21.347 --> 09:23.260
this just might be the break

09:23.304 --> 09:24.652
that we've been waiting for.

09:26.565 --> 09:29.000
Hello?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.347
Abby?

09:33.391 --> 09:35.434
Hear you got something.

09:37.956 --> 09:39.565
What? Something wrong?

09:40.565 --> 09:43.478
Not at all.

09:43.521 --> 09:46.826
Tony read me in.

09:46.869 --> 09:50.173
I heard the fantastic news
that you matched DNA

09:50.217 --> 09:52.173
from the cold case
airport bombing

09:52.217 --> 09:54.173
to a recent bomb in Colombia.

09:54.217 --> 09:56.782
That is... awesome!

09:56.826 --> 09:58.695
So?

09:58.739 --> 10:00.521
So I'm just thrilled.

10:00.565 --> 10:01.782
You got someone to run

10:01.826 --> 10:03.347
DNA for you.

10:03.391 --> 10:05.391
Someone with a lab full

10:05.434 --> 10:06.913
of DNA-running equipment.

10:06.956 --> 10:09.304
I mean, it must be so cool

10:09.347 --> 10:11.304
to know somebody like that.

10:11.347 --> 10:13.347
Abby, it's not like that.

10:13.391 --> 10:15.391
You cheated on me, Gibbs.

10:15.434 --> 10:18.347
Abby, the DNA was
in the southeast field office

10:18.391 --> 10:20.478
when I was assigned the op.

10:20.521 --> 10:24.217
It would've run through too many
hands to get up here to you.

10:25.304 --> 10:27.391
Okay, that makes sense.

10:27.434 --> 10:29.173
Awkward... [anxious laugh]

10:29.217 --> 10:31.130
What can I do
to make it up to you?

10:31.173 --> 10:32.565
Just show me what you got.

10:32.608 --> 10:34.217
Consider it done.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.608
Or consider it done
when I'm done,

10:35.652 --> 10:38.304
which should take me,
like, 30 seconds.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.173
Okay, I got a lead
on our killer.

10:40.217 --> 10:42.826
I found bloody fingerprints
in the car that belong to this

10:42.869 --> 10:44.260
fine specimen of humanity.

10:44.304 --> 10:47.434
Eddie "Collarbone" Rosario.

10:47.478 --> 10:49.217
He's been busted
for pimping more times

10:49.260 --> 10:51.217
than I've said
the word "pimping."

10:51.260 --> 10:52.304
Pimping, pimping, pimping,
pimping, pimping.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.260
Now we're tied.

10:54.304 --> 10:56.347
Our victim said she had a
falling out with her pimp.

10:56.391 --> 10:57.608
Well, then I would assume

10:57.652 --> 10:59.173
that that is him.

10:59.217 --> 11:00.434
And judging by the dead bodies,

11:00.478 --> 11:02.347
I think he won the argument.

11:03.478 --> 11:04.434
Weird.

11:04.478 --> 11:06.304
Just got an IM from Bishop.

11:06.347 --> 11:08.434
Yeah, what's it say?

11:08.478 --> 11:10.304
The admiral needs
to see you right now.

11:13.478 --> 11:15.695
Yeah.
He's already on his way.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.217
Okay, what do we have?

11:22.260 --> 11:24.304
The identity
of our petty officer.

11:24.347 --> 11:25.695
I've brought in
our ambassador to Colombia.

11:25.739 --> 11:27.434
She has news, as well.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.260
Ambassador Edmunds.

11:29.304 --> 11:30.739
Agent Gibbs,
nice to finally meet you

11:30.782 --> 11:32.304
in person, as it were.

11:32.347 --> 11:33.652
So, who was he?

11:33.695 --> 11:35.521
TYSON: Well, our male
victim's real name

11:35.565 --> 11:36.695
was Lieutenant Louis Freston.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.434
GIBBS:
I know the name.

11:38.478 --> 11:40.086
Intelligence specialist.

11:40.130 --> 11:41.521
Recently assigned.

11:41.565 --> 11:44.434
Apparently he had cultivated
Lolita as an asset.

11:44.478 --> 11:46.391
She has relatives in Colombia
who claim to know

11:46.434 --> 11:48.260
where our target
got his hair cut.

11:48.304 --> 11:50.304
You know, we get a report
like this twice a week.

11:50.347 --> 11:51.608
It never pans out.

11:51.652 --> 11:53.043
This one did.

11:53.086 --> 11:55.391
The report Freston
was about to file

11:55.434 --> 11:57.304
says Lolita was
bringing him a hair sample

11:57.347 --> 11:59.130
she'd picked up from Colombia.

11:59.173 --> 12:02.130
She was going to give it to him
the night they were killed.

12:02.173 --> 12:05.043
And if his DNA matches
the DNA from the airport bomb,

12:05.086 --> 12:06.478
we got our guy.

12:06.521 --> 12:09.217
We didn't find a hair sample
at the crime scene.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.782
According to Freston's notes,

12:10.826 --> 12:14.086
it was sewn into the lining
of the prostitute's purse.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.652
We didn't find a purse.

12:15.695 --> 12:18.565
Actually, boss, I may
have a lead on that.

12:18.608 --> 12:20.739
A store owner across
the street shot video

12:20.782 --> 12:22.304
on his cell,
just after the shooting.

12:22.347 --> 12:23.391
Let's see it.

12:37.260 --> 12:39.130
Pimp has her DNA.

12:39.173 --> 12:41.130
And you have 12 hours
to get it back.

12:41.173 --> 12:42.347
The stars are aligning,
Agent Gibbs.

12:42.391 --> 12:44.478
Ambassador?

12:44.521 --> 12:46.478
EDMUNDS: Freston's play
kicked up some chatter.

12:46.521 --> 12:50.304
I just received intel
on a meeting between Orlando

12:50.347 --> 12:51.652
and his top lieutenants.

12:51.695 --> 12:52.782
We have a location.

12:52.826 --> 12:54.391
I'm scrambling a SEAL team.

12:54.434 --> 12:57.260
You need to verify
Orlando is our guy.

12:57.304 --> 12:59.304
while we have a window
of opportunity.

12:59.347 --> 13:00.956
This is the best shot
we've had in 40 years.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.913
Understood.

13:02.956 --> 13:05.086
It's payback time.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.956
McGee?

13:25.043 --> 13:26.478
Oh, hey!
Where's Agent Gibbs?

13:26.521 --> 13:28.478
In MTAC with his favorite agent.

13:30.956 --> 13:32.565
I'm sorry. I didn't get
the chance to eat.

13:32.608 --> 13:34.130
Happy to help.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.521
McGEE:
Yeah, I need a BOLO out

13:36.565 --> 13:39.565
on a convicted pimp
named Eddie Rosario.

13:39.608 --> 13:42.086
Street name is Collarbone.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.739
Uh... excuse me,
how do I, uh...?

13:47.782 --> 13:49.913
Do you know how...?

13:49.956 --> 13:53.565
Is there a doorbell
or something?

13:53.608 --> 13:55.826
Excuse me, do you...?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.956
Okay, I'm not invisible, people!

13:58.000 --> 13:59.478
All right, I'm not invisible!

13:59.521 --> 14:01.434
TONY:
What do you want, Palmer?

14:01.478 --> 14:02.739
There is a camera.

14:02.782 --> 14:04.478
What do you want, Palmer?

14:04.521 --> 14:06.826
Dr. Mallard has news, big news!

14:06.869 --> 14:08.956
I...

14:11.565 --> 14:13.565
Uh...
[clears his throat]

14:15.478 --> 14:17.956
[door opens]

14:18.000 --> 14:19.826
McGee's got a BOLO
out on the pimp.

14:19.869 --> 14:21.913
That was Palmer
scratching at the door.

14:21.956 --> 14:22.956
Ducky's got something.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.782
Hey, put him up on the screen.

14:24.826 --> 14:26.565
Hello, Duck.

14:26.608 --> 14:29.347
Oh, I forgot you can
turn that damn thing on

14:29.391 --> 14:31.347
whenever you want, can't you?

14:31.391 --> 14:32.826
Palmer said you had something?

14:32.869 --> 14:36.434
Well, during my examination,
I found a small tattoo

14:36.478 --> 14:38.695
on the young lady's derrière.

14:38.739 --> 14:41.782
It looked as if someone
had tried to scrape it off,

14:41.826 --> 14:44.565
which I thought was a bit odd.

14:44.608 --> 14:46.608
So, I ran it down.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.130
Turns out Lolita's pimp
brands his girls

14:49.173 --> 14:50.652
with that particular tattoo.

14:50.695 --> 14:52.217
So, I was able to
track the art to...

14:52.260 --> 14:54.043
I told Tony that you wanted
to speak to Agent Gibbs.

14:54.086 --> 14:56.478
Not that Gibbs
ever actually speaks.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.130
After "What do you got, Doc?"

14:58.173 --> 14:59.434
all I ever get is...

14:59.478 --> 15:01.652
angry glare.

15:01.695 --> 15:03.347
Hey, Palmer.

15:04.521 --> 15:07.304
Angry glare.

15:07.347 --> 15:11.086
Uh, pimp brands his girls,
and I was able to track

15:11.130 --> 15:14.173
the tattoo art to the Web site
of the parlor that does it.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.434
Thanks, Bishop.Yeah, may give us a lead

15:16.478 --> 15:17.913
on where Collarbone hangs out.

15:17.956 --> 15:20.608
All right, take, uh,
McGee with you, huh?

15:22.782 --> 15:25.086
[laughs]
All right, McGee.

15:25.130 --> 15:27.521
You've been pouting the whole
car ride-- let's hear it.

15:27.565 --> 15:29.913
So, two years, huh?I don't want to hear it.

15:29.956 --> 15:31.695
You've been working on
this op for two years

15:31.739 --> 15:33.347
and never said anything.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.956
Well, it was, um...

15:35.000 --> 15:36.956
what do you call it?
Oh, yeah! Classified.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.521
Oh, come on, how many
times have I hacked

15:38.565 --> 15:40.260
classified data and
shared it with you?

15:40.304 --> 15:42.695
47 times.Yeah, it's...

15:42.739 --> 15:43.956
You know what?
That's probably right.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.086
But you proved my point.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.434
Which is?Can't trust you anymore.

15:47.478 --> 15:51.173
[sighs] You're just upset
'cause Gibbs read me
in and not you.

15:51.217 --> 15:55.000
That's not it at all, all right?

15:55.043 --> 15:56.347
I'm sure he had his reasons.

15:56.391 --> 15:59.521
As misguided as
they probably were.

16:02.130 --> 16:04.695
Sign number one you've walked
into the wrong tattoo shop.

16:04.739 --> 16:05.956
Smells like cat pee?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.130
Yeah. [groans]

16:09.173 --> 16:11.086
MAN:
Just a sec! Got a bleeder!

16:11.130 --> 16:12.391
We'll wait.

16:12.434 --> 16:14.000
Hope he enjoys the hepatitis.

16:14.043 --> 16:15.260
Hey, we're not done
yet, by the way.

16:15.304 --> 16:17.565
Well, what is left?

16:17.608 --> 16:18.956
I was read in first.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.695
And now you have been read in.

16:20.739 --> 16:23.173
How do I know you're not
working on another secret op?

16:23.217 --> 16:26.086
How do I know you're not
working on another secret op?

16:27.304 --> 16:29.739
Are you working
on another secret op?

16:30.913 --> 16:33.086
McGee!Hurts, doesn't it?

16:33.130 --> 16:36.043
TONY: All right,
for what it's worth,

16:36.086 --> 16:38.434
I felt bad lying to you.

16:38.478 --> 16:39.565
I think you enjoyed it.

16:39.608 --> 16:40.869
A little bit.

16:40.913 --> 16:42.608
But mostly I felt bad.

16:42.652 --> 16:44.913
Apology accepted.

16:44.956 --> 16:47.173
[clears his throat]

16:47.217 --> 16:50.217
You two...
maybe want to be alone?

16:53.826 --> 16:55.304
Edward Rosario?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.260
Nobody calls me Edward.

16:58.304 --> 17:01.130
It's Collarbone.

17:01.173 --> 17:03.608
We're not "nobody."

17:05.086 --> 17:06.478
[speaks Spanish]

17:06.521 --> 17:08.130
Yeah, thank God
I'm out of that car.

17:08.173 --> 17:09.956
You two have
the worst taste in music

17:10.000 --> 17:12.304
I've heard in my life.

17:12.347 --> 17:14.347
Ah!

17:14.391 --> 17:16.391
You found the pimp.

17:16.434 --> 17:17.956
Pimp by night.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.130
Tattoo artist by day.

17:19.173 --> 17:20.217
The purse?

17:20.260 --> 17:21.608
In his trunk.

17:21.652 --> 17:23.956
There was a DNA tube
sewn in to the lining.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.043
I'm running it
down to Abby now.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.869
I will brief Gibbs.Okay.

17:28.913 --> 17:30.086
Commander, give me a sitrep.

17:30.130 --> 17:32.565
My men are deployed
and standing by.

17:32.608 --> 17:34.478
Just awaiting the go-order.
We're chomping at the bit here.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.304
We all are, Commander Hankos.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.000
Might not be much longer.

17:38.043 --> 17:39.391
Tony and McGee
found the pimp.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.043
They get our target's DNA?

17:41.086 --> 17:43.434
Tony's bringing the sample
to Abby, as we speak.

17:43.478 --> 17:46.521
Shouldn't take her long to
verify that Orlando is our guy.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.347
How secure is
your team's position?

17:48.391 --> 17:50.608
Colombia's not the safest place
for Navy SEALs

17:50.652 --> 17:52.826
to hang out in,
but they'll make do.

17:52.869 --> 17:54.217
Understood.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.000
Where's the pimp?

17:56.043 --> 17:57.304
McGee brought him
to interrogation.

17:57.347 --> 17:59.130
HANKOS: You think he's working
with Orlando?

17:59.173 --> 18:00.826
We're gonna find out.

18:00.869 --> 18:03.304
If he is, no deals,
no plea bargains.

18:03.347 --> 18:05.086
You make him pay.

18:05.130 --> 18:06.956
People may have forgotten
about the Metropolitan attack.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.913
I haven't.

18:12.173 --> 18:15.608
Commander Hankos
hasn't forgotten?

18:15.652 --> 18:18.217
He must've been, like, a baby
when the attack happened.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.391
He was.
What he hasn't forgotten

18:20.434 --> 18:24.043
was growing up without a father,
because of it.

18:24.086 --> 18:25.869
[sighs]

18:25.913 --> 18:28.608
What are the odds he'd be
the one commanding this mission?

18:28.652 --> 18:30.695
About as good as it gets.

18:30.739 --> 18:33.130
He asked to command
this mission.

18:33.173 --> 18:35.260
When it's time for payback,
he wants to be the one

18:35.304 --> 18:36.521
to write the check.

18:36.565 --> 18:40.391
And I know exactly how he feels.

18:40.434 --> 18:42.521
[sighs]

18:52.478 --> 18:55.130
Sit down.

18:57.086 --> 18:59.260
Sit down or I'll sit you down.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.652
[laughs]

19:00.695 --> 19:01.869
You don't scare me.

19:01.913 --> 19:04.260
You lay one hand on me,

19:04.304 --> 19:07.217
and... [chuckles]

19:07.260 --> 19:09.217
Go on.

19:09.260 --> 19:11.608
I'll wait. Finish.

19:13.260 --> 19:16.173
Fine.

19:16.217 --> 19:20.043
Sitting works, if you want
to be all anal about it.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.434
How long you been working
for Tomás Orlando?

19:26.478 --> 19:27.695
Who?

19:31.695 --> 19:33.608
That jog your memory?

19:33.652 --> 19:35.130
Nah.

19:35.173 --> 19:36.173
You killed her

19:36.217 --> 19:37.565
and you took something from her.

19:37.608 --> 19:38.739
I don't know what
you're smoking,

19:38.782 --> 19:40.434
but I'd like a hit.

19:40.478 --> 19:44.000
The DNA sample that
was in her purse.

19:44.043 --> 19:47.826
And you took it. Why?

19:47.869 --> 19:49.608
[laughs]
DNA, man! DNA!

19:49.652 --> 19:51.260
I don't know anything
about no-no DNA.

19:51.304 --> 19:53.173
Do I look like a DNA
kind of guy to you?

19:53.217 --> 19:54.869
You look like a life
without parole

19:54.913 --> 19:56.913
kind of guy.

19:58.304 --> 20:00.608
I got your vehicle's tire tracks
at the crime scene.

20:00.652 --> 20:03.000
Got your bloody prints
on the victim.

20:03.043 --> 20:04.913
Okay, wait a second here.

20:04.956 --> 20:06.086
DNA! Talk.

20:06.130 --> 20:08.086
Hey, look, I already told you.

20:08.130 --> 20:09.565
I don't know what you...

20:09.608 --> 20:11.652
Who told you to take
that sample?

20:11.695 --> 20:14.391
I don't know
what you're talking about!

20:19.739 --> 20:21.304
Okay, I...

20:21.347 --> 20:24.130
I manage a tattoo parlor
during the day, okay?

20:24.173 --> 20:26.043
But at night, I-I-I...

20:26.086 --> 20:28.739
I run this small
freelance escort service.

20:28.782 --> 20:31.086
You're a pimp.Okay, semantics.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.130
Anyways...

20:33.173 --> 20:34.565
Lolita was one of my girls.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.434
Then, last week,
she tells me she's out!

20:36.478 --> 20:38.652
Nah. No.

20:38.695 --> 20:41.304
No one quits Collarbone, no.

20:41.347 --> 20:43.347
Then, last night,
I find out she's

20:43.391 --> 20:47.043
working my turf, I-I... I got to
send a message to my girls, man.

20:47.086 --> 20:48.478
So, you kill her?

20:48.521 --> 20:51.347
A man's got nothing...

20:51.391 --> 20:53.913
if he doesn't have
his reputation.

20:53.956 --> 20:55.521
Why'd you take the DNA?

20:55.565 --> 20:57.869
The DNA? I don't know
anything about no DNA, man!

20:57.913 --> 20:59.565
I told you!

20:59.608 --> 21:01.043
I took her purse and that's all!

21:01.086 --> 21:04.000
Because whatever bank
she made that night was mine!

21:04.043 --> 21:07.608
I mean, fair's fair, right?

21:07.652 --> 21:10.000
You seem reasonable.

21:10.043 --> 21:11.130
[door opens]

21:11.173 --> 21:14.434
Hi. Apologies to
Rule 22, Gibbs,

21:14.478 --> 21:17.173
but I finished running
Orlando's DNA and...

21:22.130 --> 21:23.956
Are your men
in position, Commander?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.608
They will be in half a mike.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.695
BISHOP:
Where are they?

21:30.739 --> 21:31.695
I don't see anyone.

21:31.739 --> 21:32.913
They're there.

21:32.956 --> 21:34.478
Any chatter from the locals?

21:34.521 --> 21:35.869
Nothing.

21:37.086 --> 21:39.434
We are a go for takedown.

21:39.478 --> 21:40.869
Takedown is a go.

21:40.913 --> 21:42.391
SQUAD LEADER:
Roger. Copy that. Move in.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.000
Switching to helmet cams.

21:47.913 --> 21:49.956
SQUAD LEADER:
Breaching the back entrance.

21:52.956 --> 21:54.782
Clear.

21:55.826 --> 21:56.956
Fan out. Loop around.

21:59.869 --> 22:01.086
Clear!

22:09.739 --> 22:10.913
Clear.

22:12.521 --> 22:15.913
Commander,
the target isn't here.

22:15.956 --> 22:18.565
Nobody is.

22:29.869 --> 22:32.391
The intel our office received
was good.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.521
Orlando had a confirmed meeting

22:34.565 --> 22:38.217
with his top lieutenants
in the building at 2100 hours.

22:38.260 --> 22:39.608
It looks like he canceled.

22:39.652 --> 22:41.869
VANCE: He could have
found out about the assault.

22:41.913 --> 22:43.304
Did you alert
the government of Colombia

22:43.347 --> 22:44.913
that we were making a play?

22:44.956 --> 22:47.478
With all due respect,
are you out of your mind?

22:47.521 --> 22:50.869
Uh, boss, we've got
Commander Hankos on the line.

22:50.913 --> 22:51.913
Patch him in.

22:51.956 --> 22:53.260
EDMUNDS:
I'm already getting

22:53.304 --> 22:55.260
screaming phone calls
from my counterpart,

22:55.304 --> 22:57.173
wondering if the U.S.
is running an op

22:57.217 --> 22:58.173
on sovereign Colombian soil.

22:58.217 --> 23:00.304
Commander,
what's your status?

23:00.347 --> 23:01.913
HANKOS:
My men are holding position

23:01.956 --> 23:03.304
in the Delta Quadrant.

23:03.347 --> 23:05.043
They started taking fire
from some locals,

23:05.086 --> 23:07.043
so we had to pull back
from Orlando's compound.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.347
Is it your recommendation, then,
that we abort the mission?

23:09.391 --> 23:11.304
Hell, no. Place was
cleaned out in a hurry.

23:11.347 --> 23:13.086
We're right on his tail.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.260
You get any useful intel
from the compound?

23:15.304 --> 23:17.304
We recovered a partially
destroyed laptop,

23:17.347 --> 23:19.260
but the hard drive's
still intact.

23:19.304 --> 23:21.260
Anything there we could use
to track the target?

23:21.304 --> 23:23.217
Unknown.
It was encrypted.

23:23.260 --> 23:25.086
My tech's still trying
to access it.

23:25.130 --> 23:28.434
Commander, Abby Sciuto and I
might have some better luck.

23:28.478 --> 23:30.434
You're welcome to try,
but it'll take

23:30.478 --> 23:32.956
at least 12 hours
to get that laptop to DC.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
My men don't have
that kind of time.

23:35.043 --> 23:36.217
Our people can meet.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.043
Meaning what?

23:38.086 --> 23:41.043
The commander's
aircraft carrier in the Gulf.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.086
I'll... run down
to tell Abby.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.434
In the meantime, what do I tell
the Colombian ambassador?

23:45.478 --> 23:47.217
You're a diplomat.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.086
Say something diplomatic.

23:57.173 --> 23:58.173
Nice timing.Nice timing.

23:58.217 --> 23:59.347
Me first.Me first.

23:59.391 --> 24:00.521
Abby first. Go.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.130
I got a second hit

24:02.173 --> 24:04.086
on the most recent
DNA sample from Orlando.

24:04.130 --> 24:06.086
It's a familial match.

24:06.130 --> 24:07.304
Who?

24:07.347 --> 24:09.086
He has a niece that lives
outside Baltimore.

24:09.130 --> 24:11.043
Well, she may be in
contact with the uncle.

24:11.086 --> 24:12.304
Maybe she knows
where he is.

24:12.347 --> 24:14.304
Abbs, good work.
Now go pack your bags.

24:14.347 --> 24:15.217
Where am I going?

24:15.260 --> 24:17.304
Hey. Abby found a relative.

24:17.347 --> 24:18.826
We heard.

24:18.869 --> 24:20.304
Relative's name
is Dr. Susanna Soto.

24:20.347 --> 24:22.260
Runs a family therapy practice
in Rosedale.

24:22.304 --> 24:23.434
How long she been here?

24:23.478 --> 24:25.521
She was born in the States.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.304
Going by DNA, her father
and Orlando were brothers.

24:28.347 --> 24:30.956
Were?Yeah, her parents were killed
when she was seven.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.130
Raised by her mother's family.

24:32.173 --> 24:34.173
We don't even know
if she knows her uncle.

24:34.217 --> 24:35.869
Any contact with anyone
in Colombia?

24:35.913 --> 24:37.782
Nothing on her cell
or landline.

24:37.826 --> 24:39.260
E-mail.Not on her main account,

24:39.304 --> 24:41.130
but she could have others
we don't know about.

24:41.173 --> 24:43.043
We would need physical access
to her computer to be certain.

24:43.086 --> 24:46.000
TONY: We already got a warrant,
but if we go in heavy,

24:46.043 --> 24:48.217
the uncle could be watching--
might tip him off.

24:48.260 --> 24:50.391
What's the play? There's no time
for a lengthy interrogation,

24:50.434 --> 24:54.478
and we risk getting bad intel
if we turn the screws.

24:54.521 --> 24:56.217
That's the play.

25:00.913 --> 25:03.086
Aw. We're gonna be parents.

25:05.391 --> 25:07.695
TONY:
Boss, you reading us?

25:07.739 --> 25:08.695
Loud and clear.

25:08.739 --> 25:10.043
All right.

25:10.086 --> 25:11.043
So, what's the plan, Bishop?

25:11.086 --> 25:13.000
BISHOP:
We go in, get settled.

25:13.043 --> 25:15.217
Then I excuse myself
to use the bathroom,

25:15.260 --> 25:17.043
I find Dr. Soto's PC

25:17.086 --> 25:19.000
and mirror her hard drive
onto this.

25:19.043 --> 25:20.913
Perfect.

25:20.956 --> 25:22.173
Wives first.

25:22.217 --> 25:24.086
Thanks, honey.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.043
SOTO:
Come on in.

25:33.086 --> 25:35.086
We're back here.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.869
Please come in.

25:42.913 --> 25:44.478
Join us.

25:44.521 --> 25:45.956
[chuckles softly]

25:46.000 --> 25:47.913
Oh. Hi.

25:47.956 --> 25:49.086
Uh... [chuckles]

25:49.130 --> 25:52.173
Um, is this
the parenting class?

25:52.217 --> 25:53.217
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.086
There was a mix-up
on the Web site.

25:55.130 --> 25:57.304
Tonight is my
couples intimacy class.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.043
Oh.

25:59.086 --> 26:01.000
Well, this should
be interesting.

26:01.043 --> 26:03.043
TONY:
I lied. I was a...

26:03.086 --> 26:04.826
afraid to tell
you the truth.

26:04.869 --> 26:06.347
[chuckles] Because...

26:06.391 --> 26:08.478
I-I didn't think
you would come.

26:08.521 --> 26:10.086
SOTO:
Oh, I see.

26:10.130 --> 26:12.000
But you must
understand,

26:12.043 --> 26:15.173
the first ingredient
for intimacy is trust.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.391
SOTO:
Please sit down.

26:20.434 --> 26:23.086
TONY: All right, let's check out
these cool pillows.

26:23.130 --> 26:24.260
Comfy.

26:24.304 --> 26:25.608
[grunts, laughs]

26:25.652 --> 26:27.043
SOTO:
Uh...

26:27.086 --> 26:29.217
why don't you both sit down?

26:29.260 --> 26:31.000
Actually, I have to use
the restroom.

26:31.043 --> 26:32.000
Please.

26:32.043 --> 26:34.304
You're here, so be here.

26:34.347 --> 26:35.347
But I really...

26:35.391 --> 26:37.086
Sit.
Please.

26:38.304 --> 26:39.739
Okay.

26:39.782 --> 26:41.260
[quietly]:
Thank you.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.304
Now, take his hands.Huh?

26:45.347 --> 26:47.956
Oh, gosh. For real, I-I'm
actually getting over a cold.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.347
Hands-- out.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.173
Guess that's better
than my feet.

26:52.217 --> 26:54.260
[awkward laughter]

26:54.304 --> 26:56.260
Now, look into his eyes...

26:56.304 --> 26:57.782
[mouthing]

26:57.826 --> 26:59.347
Ah, geez.

26:59.391 --> 27:01.000
I can't watch this.

27:06.086 --> 27:07.086
Okay. Now what?

27:07.130 --> 27:09.130
No. Don't break eye contact.

27:12.043 --> 27:13.869
BISHOP:
So, now what?

27:13.913 --> 27:15.956
Just keep looking.

27:19.478 --> 27:22.260
He's going to file
for hazard pay.

27:38.217 --> 27:40.043
Whoa.

27:40.086 --> 27:42.565
Okay... tailhooking
is the coolest thing

27:42.608 --> 27:44.391
I have ever done
in my life.

27:44.434 --> 27:46.304
Well, so much
for hugging a panda.

27:46.347 --> 27:48.956
Agent McGee, Ms. Sciuto,
glad you could make it.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.521
Follow me.
We're tight on time.

27:50.565 --> 27:52.913
Any progress
accessing Orlando's laptop?

27:52.956 --> 27:55.608
I'll let Petty Officer
Goode fill you in.

27:59.347 --> 28:00.565
Hi. I'm...

28:00.608 --> 28:02.869
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Agent McGee.

28:02.913 --> 28:04.478
You wasted your time
coming here.

28:04.521 --> 28:07.000
I was able to access
the laptop on my own,

28:07.043 --> 28:09.739
so you might as well
get back on your...

28:09.782 --> 28:11.739
your, uh...

28:11.782 --> 28:13.739
You're Abby Sciuto.

28:15.086 --> 28:17.043
And you're...

28:17.086 --> 28:18.608
Petty Officer Goode.

28:18.652 --> 28:22.043
You dated my roommate's
brother's best friend,

28:22.086 --> 28:23.913
like, 11 years ago.

28:25.086 --> 28:27.304
Wow.
You have a really good memory.

28:27.347 --> 28:29.260
You're kind of memorable.

28:29.304 --> 28:30.869
ABBY:
Um...

28:30.913 --> 28:33.043
uh, so you accessed the laptop.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.434
Yeah.

28:34.478 --> 28:35.869
And...?

28:35.913 --> 28:37.869
Oh, and I found
the details to the meeting

28:37.913 --> 28:39.913
on Orlando's compound
that we already knew about.

28:39.956 --> 28:41.391
That was about it.

28:41.434 --> 28:44.086
Okay. Do you mind if we
take a look ourselves?

28:44.130 --> 28:45.739
Uh, hold on--
one second.

28:45.782 --> 28:47.217
Did you say 11 years ago?

28:47.260 --> 28:48.521
No.
Yeah.

28:48.565 --> 28:50.695
Uh, my roommate's
brother's best friend

28:50.739 --> 28:53.173
was a barista at this
coffeehouse called Buzzed.

28:53.217 --> 28:55.000
Oh, Buzzed.

28:55.043 --> 28:56.565
Hey, we know that well.

28:56.608 --> 28:58.043
I used to take you there
all the time, 11 years ago.

28:58.086 --> 28:59.608
Oh.

28:59.652 --> 29:00.826
[chuckling]:
Oh.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.739
So, are the two of you...

29:02.782 --> 29:04.173
No.
No.

29:04.217 --> 29:05.347
ABBY:
Uh...

29:05.391 --> 29:07.652
[sighs][sighs] What was that?

29:07.695 --> 29:11.043
I mean, you know, you're...
you're like my brother and...

29:11.086 --> 29:12.434
Yeah, I know,
you're like my sister,

29:12.478 --> 29:14.434
but I wouldn't [sighs] you
like that. Come on.

29:14.478 --> 29:17.478
[chuckling]:
Oh. Okay, now I get it.

29:17.521 --> 29:19.173
What do you get?

29:19.217 --> 29:21.391
You got dogged by the barista.

29:21.434 --> 29:24.000
Right under your nose.

29:24.043 --> 29:27.826
Uh, could we just please
get to work and...?

29:27.869 --> 29:29.956
I mean, it was...Abby, don't worry about it.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.043
It's ancient history.
It's fine.

29:31.086 --> 29:33.782
Listen, you,

29:33.826 --> 29:35.608
our friend Abby Sciuto
here said that we need

29:35.652 --> 29:38.043
to get to work, so...
how about we do that?

29:38.086 --> 29:40.652
Yeah, uh...
if I let that one get away,

29:40.695 --> 29:42.608
I'd bury myself in my work, too.

29:42.652 --> 29:44.043
Or start drinking.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.086
[laughs] My lady.

29:54.695 --> 29:57.478
Oh. How did your
undercover op go?

29:57.521 --> 29:59.086
No comment.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.956
[sighs]
I need a shower.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.826
Oh... [chuckles]

30:05.086 --> 30:07.521
So, uh, who's briefing Gibbs?

30:07.565 --> 30:08.869
Not me.

30:08.913 --> 30:10.434
I need a moment.

30:10.478 --> 30:12.260
For what?

30:13.304 --> 30:15.173
I may have intimacy issues.

30:15.217 --> 30:19.347
Well, tonight,
I was thankful for them.

30:22.565 --> 30:24.913
Our people having any luck
with Orlando's laptop?

30:24.956 --> 30:27.391
Agent McGee said
they'll need another hour.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.391
It's getting tight.

30:28.434 --> 30:29.608
What about the agents

30:29.652 --> 30:31.521
who made contact with
the family member?

30:31.565 --> 30:32.782
Bishop.

30:32.826 --> 30:35.000
I finally got permission
to use the restroom...

30:35.043 --> 30:36.434
Is she talking to Orlando?

30:36.478 --> 30:38.391
It's going to take
some time to find out.

30:38.434 --> 30:40.173
She's got some issues
of her own.

30:40.217 --> 30:41.608
She's a cyber-hoarder.

30:41.652 --> 30:43.478
She's got three decades
of files on her PC.

30:43.521 --> 30:45.347
It could take weeks
to run it all down.

30:45.391 --> 30:46.521
We don't have weeks.

30:46.565 --> 30:48.043
Just a matter of time
before Orlando

30:48.086 --> 30:49.956
finds out Navy SEALs
were in his compound.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.260
Then he goes down and
never comes back up again.

30:52.304 --> 30:53.521
We either find this guy
this go-around

30:53.565 --> 30:54.521
or we could lose him forever.

30:54.565 --> 30:56.478
Found him.

30:57.608 --> 30:58.608
Where?

30:58.652 --> 30:59.913
Squad room.

31:01.347 --> 31:02.782
In the where?

31:02.826 --> 31:04.478
Squad room, ma'am.

31:14.347 --> 31:16.434
Hello.

31:16.478 --> 31:20.000
I am Tomás Orlando.

31:22.217 --> 31:32.260
I am seeking asylum from
the United States of America.

31:32.260 --> 31:38.434
I am seeking asylum from
the United States of America.

31:38.478 --> 31:42.695
[door opens]

31:42.739 --> 31:45.695
Per regulations, I notified
State of his asylum request.

31:45.739 --> 31:48.521
They wanted
to know, quote,

31:48.565 --> 31:50.130
"how the hell
he got through customs."

31:50.173 --> 31:52.000
Well, he's a professional
drug smuggler.

31:52.043 --> 31:53.173
I doubt he
waited in line.

31:53.217 --> 31:54.391
What's he up to?

31:54.434 --> 31:56.826
Well, whatever it is,

31:56.869 --> 32:00.391
he's got a pair,
I'll give him that.

32:00.434 --> 32:02.695
So what's the play?

32:02.739 --> 32:04.347
He came to us.

32:04.391 --> 32:06.043
Let's go find out.

32:22.217 --> 32:25.391
May I assume you've spoken
to your State Department?

32:25.434 --> 32:27.043
[Tony scoffs]

32:27.086 --> 32:28.956
I wouldn't hold
my breath.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.956
Asylum isn't really
for, um...

32:31.000 --> 32:32.347
What do they call
it again?

32:32.391 --> 32:33.826
Oh, yeah, terrorists.

32:35.826 --> 32:37.391
I'm a freedom fighter.

32:37.434 --> 32:40.739
You are a murderer
and a drug dealer.

32:40.782 --> 32:43.521
Maybe if your country
stopped giving weapons

32:43.565 --> 32:45.130
to the wrong team,

32:45.173 --> 32:48.130
I wouldn't have to sell drugs
to finance my cause.

32:48.173 --> 32:49.695
Oh, really?

32:49.739 --> 32:51.521
You got a cause?
Justice.

32:51.565 --> 32:54.521
From a corrupt government.

32:54.565 --> 32:57.043
A government which has
imprisoned me for decades

32:57.086 --> 32:59.086
because I stood up to it.

32:59.130 --> 33:02.652
So now you're going to be
in prison here, for decades.

33:02.695 --> 33:06.043
I had nothing to do
with that airport attack.

33:06.086 --> 33:08.130
Nothing.

33:08.173 --> 33:10.391
That's interesting.

33:12.434 --> 33:14.826
Your DNA was
on the bomb, pal.

33:14.869 --> 33:18.217
Whatever DNA you
have is not mine!

33:21.086 --> 33:23.130
I'm being set up.

33:24.521 --> 33:26.434
Talk.

33:27.478 --> 33:29.434
I've known for months

33:29.478 --> 33:30.869
the United States
government was trying

33:30.913 --> 33:32.478
to get a sample
of my DNA.

33:32.521 --> 33:34.652
I just didn't know why.

33:34.695 --> 33:39.826
At least not until your
informant was killed.

33:40.869 --> 33:42.826
The girl...

33:42.869 --> 33:47.043
her family came to
me for protection.

33:47.086 --> 33:49.086
They told me everything.

33:50.739 --> 33:54.173
That's when I realized
I was being framed.

33:54.217 --> 33:57.043
I had nothing to do with
the Metropolitan bombing.

33:57.086 --> 33:59.086
Nothing to do with it.

34:00.391 --> 34:01.782
Fascinating.

34:01.826 --> 34:04.130
So you just decided
to pop up north here

34:04.173 --> 34:06.217
and tell us that in person?

34:06.260 --> 34:09.434
I came here because
I have a family.

34:09.478 --> 34:12.652
And I know how
you cowboys work.

34:12.695 --> 34:15.086
Shoot first,
ask questions later.

34:19.695 --> 34:22.043
My children...

34:22.086 --> 34:26.652
are more important to me
than my entire empire.

34:26.695 --> 34:30.043
I'm not willing to risk them
getting cruise-missiled

34:30.086 --> 34:32.086
coming home from
school one day.

34:33.478 --> 34:36.434
I want them to
learn how to read,

34:36.478 --> 34:39.913
not how to scan the skies,
looking for drones.

34:42.043 --> 34:44.000
So...

34:46.217 --> 34:47.956
You win.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.782
Just like that.

34:51.826 --> 34:53.826
I was retiring anyway.

34:55.826 --> 34:58.695
I was announcing it at that
meeting you tried to crash.

35:00.739 --> 35:03.173
And I can see that
you don't trust me.

35:03.217 --> 35:05.608
The beauty is...

35:05.652 --> 35:08.434
you don't need to.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.391
See for yourself.

35:12.434 --> 35:14.434
I didn't make that bomb.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Whoever did found out
that you're after him...

35:21.086 --> 35:23.434
...and he is playing you.

35:27.304 --> 35:30.304
He's playing you like a fiddle.

35:35.304 --> 35:37.956
JIMMY: Found the instruction
book in the drawer.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.391
Just like Abby said.

35:40.434 --> 35:42.347
I have Orlando's DNA.

35:44.695 --> 35:47.608
Let's see if we
can match it

35:47.652 --> 35:50.521
to the original
airport bomb.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.000
Maybe you guys need a Caf-POW.

35:52.043 --> 35:53.434
Are you sure
you can handle this?

35:53.478 --> 35:54.739
DUCKY:
Absolutely.

35:54.782 --> 35:56.826
The instruction manual,
please, Mr. Palmer.

35:56.869 --> 35:59.826
Don't you think
that I should probably take

35:59.869 --> 36:01.478
the driver's seat
on this one, Doctor?

36:01.521 --> 36:03.956
Driver's seat?

36:04.000 --> 36:07.347
This is an autopsy-- I do have
more extensive lab training.

36:07.391 --> 36:09.347
Oh, really?

36:09.391 --> 36:11.000
Oh, come now, gentlemen.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.130
No need to fight.

36:12.173 --> 36:13.652
I graduated
with top honors

36:13.695 --> 36:15.652
from my class of Forensics

36:15.695 --> 36:18.043
at, uh, the University
of Edinburgh.

36:18.086 --> 36:20.434
Yes, in nineteen-twenty...?

36:20.478 --> 36:22.347
Pull up, Jimbo.I'm just saying.

36:22.391 --> 36:24.869
That you wish to be
cleaning intestines

36:24.913 --> 36:27.173
off the autopsy floor
for the remainder

36:27.217 --> 36:29.347
of your tenure at NCIS?

36:30.826 --> 36:32.695
That sounded
like a threat, Doctor.

36:32.739 --> 36:36.000
Well, apparently, my command
of the English language

36:36.043 --> 36:39.521
has not been dulled by
the ravages of time.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.521
Nor my ability to read.

36:45.434 --> 36:48.043
Let it go, Elsa.

36:52.739 --> 36:54.521
You wanted to speak
with me, Ambassador?

36:54.565 --> 36:57.478
Yes, I'm running out of lies to
tell the Columbian government.

36:57.521 --> 36:59.043
They know we're up to something.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.913
It's a moot point now.

37:00.956 --> 37:03.086
My men are pulling back
to the extraction point

37:03.130 --> 37:04.956
since NCIS has
the target in custody.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.434
In custody?

37:06.478 --> 37:07.869
Since when?

37:07.913 --> 37:10.000
He turned himself in
while you were in conference.

37:10.043 --> 37:11.347
It's a fluid situation.

37:11.391 --> 37:13.739
He claims that he's been set up.

37:13.782 --> 37:14.913
It's not a claim.

37:14.956 --> 37:16.478
He was set up.

37:16.521 --> 37:18.913
Orlando's not our guy.

37:18.956 --> 37:22.217
His DNA does not match the
sample from the airport bomb.

37:23.434 --> 37:24.695
Someone tried to frame him.

37:24.739 --> 37:25.782
Are you sure?

37:25.826 --> 37:27.304
As it gets.

37:27.347 --> 37:29.173
So we have nothing.

37:29.217 --> 37:30.956
We're back to 40 years ago.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.826
No... no, we have something.

37:32.869 --> 37:34.565
We know the bomber's
still alive.

37:34.608 --> 37:36.652
12 hours ago, he used DNA
off his own head

37:36.695 --> 37:38.260
to try and frame Orlando.

37:38.304 --> 37:39.913
EDMUNDS: When the Columbians
realize just what kind

37:39.956 --> 37:41.782
of incursion we've committed,

37:41.826 --> 37:43.608
they'll place their military
on high alert.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.782
If I'm gonna reactivate my team,
we're gonna need something fast.

37:46.826 --> 37:48.913
Well, I guess you've come
to the right place.

37:48.956 --> 37:50.913
Or... I have.

37:50.956 --> 37:52.434
Hi, Gibbs.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.869
Hi, Vance.
Hi, other people

37:53.913 --> 37:54.869
pushing buttons
and stuff.

37:54.913 --> 37:55.956
Abbs, what do you got?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.956
A keystroke logger, Gibbs.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.782
McGee found it embedded
on Orlando's laptop.

38:00.826 --> 38:03.565
Someone has been spying
on him for weeks.

38:03.608 --> 38:05.739
Good work, but Orlando's
no longer our target.

38:05.782 --> 38:07.956
Well, who was on the other
side of that bug?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.521
Um, I traced it back to
a State Department IP address.

38:11.565 --> 38:13.956
Ambassador Edmunds...?

38:15.086 --> 38:17.869
You had access to Orlando's
computer for weeks,

38:17.913 --> 38:19.608
and you neglected
to tell us?

38:19.652 --> 38:20.869
I'm sorry, what
did you say?

38:20.913 --> 38:21.739
The connection's
getting fuzzy.

38:23.434 --> 38:24.652
VANCE: Get me the
Secretary of State.

38:24.695 --> 38:25.869
Tell him it's
an emergency.

38:25.913 --> 38:27.260
I need to speak with him
as soon as possible.

38:27.304 --> 38:28.478
Call Diplomatic Security
at Foggy Bottom, tell him

38:28.521 --> 38:29.782
that we have a situation
with Ambassador Edmunds.

38:29.826 --> 38:31.608
MPs caught up with her
in the parking lot.

38:31.652 --> 38:32.826
Turned herself in.

38:32.869 --> 38:34.000
Says she wants
to talk to you.

38:34.043 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, well,
feeling's mutual.

38:44.913 --> 38:46.739
I want to make a deal.

38:46.782 --> 38:47.913
Oh, I'll bet you do.

38:47.956 --> 38:49.739
We don't have much time,
you know that.

38:49.782 --> 38:51.434
Tell me what's going on.

38:51.478 --> 38:53.434
Not without a deal.

38:53.478 --> 38:55.869
You're protecting
a terrorist.

38:57.782 --> 39:01.826
Talk, and I will see
if I can help.

39:01.869 --> 39:03.826
They will never
give you a deal.

39:05.739 --> 39:09.347
Someone gave you access to
the bug on Orlando's laptop.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.347
You fed us his location.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.956
You helped set him up.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.565
Who are you working for?

39:15.608 --> 39:17.869
I'm not working for anybody.

39:19.521 --> 39:21.521
I'm not a willing
accomplice.

39:22.913 --> 39:24.739
I was threatened.

39:24.782 --> 39:26.565
By who?

39:28.608 --> 39:30.739
35 years ago,

39:30.782 --> 39:33.608
he was in prison for leading
a Communist rebel group.

39:33.652 --> 39:36.521
When he got out,
he moved into the drug trade.

39:36.565 --> 39:38.478
He told me if I didn't
help him frame Orlando,

39:38.521 --> 39:40.434
he would kill
everyone I care about.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.391
Why didn't you come to us?

39:46.956 --> 39:48.913
Because you were
working for him.

39:48.956 --> 39:51.086
No.

39:51.130 --> 39:53.130
What does he have on you?

39:54.130 --> 39:56.608
I took money.

39:56.652 --> 39:58.956
For pushing a favorable
U.S. drug policy in Colombia.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.347
Just once.

40:00.391 --> 40:01.826
That was it.

40:03.347 --> 40:05.652
And then...

40:05.695 --> 40:07.652
And then he owned you.

40:07.695 --> 40:09.434
Yeah.

40:09.478 --> 40:11.478
He attacked your country.

40:15.652 --> 40:17.739
Are you gonna tell me
his name or not?

40:27.826 --> 40:29.478
NEWSCASTER: There's no official
confirmation, yet,

40:29.521 --> 40:32.478
but we have reports
that the U.S. Navy launched

40:32.521 --> 40:34.043
a drone strike,
early this morning,

40:34.086 --> 40:36.739
against the compound of Armand
Luna, a Colombian drug lord.

40:36.782 --> 40:40.130
It is rumored that DNA evidence
has linked Luna

40:40.173 --> 40:42.043
to the 1979 bombing

40:42.086 --> 40:44.043
of Metropolitan
International Airport.

40:44.086 --> 40:45.956
You gonna remain
silent, too, sir?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.782
We got him.

40:52.565 --> 40:54.521
So maybe it was just a
teensy little overlap

40:54.565 --> 40:55.869
with the barista bit.

40:55.913 --> 40:57.434
Exactly how much overlap
are we talking about here?

40:57.478 --> 40:58.956
You said this was
ancient history.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.782
It is, but I need to know
whether or not I can trust you.

41:01.826 --> 41:03.521
Don't ever say you
can't trust me, McGee.

41:03.565 --> 41:05.565
Director.

41:05.608 --> 41:07.565
I have a debriefing
at the Pentagon,

41:07.608 --> 41:09.565
but I just wanted to thank
you both personally.

41:09.608 --> 41:11.695
Thank you, Commander.

41:11.739 --> 41:14.000
You put your men
on the line for a thing.

41:14.043 --> 41:16.391
A thing that a lot
of people forgot about.

41:16.434 --> 41:18.000
You didn't.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.826
Neither did my mother, my
sisters or my big brother.

41:20.869 --> 41:22.043
They thank you, too.

41:22.086 --> 41:24.086
It's the president,
Director.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.565
Press conference starts
in 25 minutes.

41:26.608 --> 41:27.739
Got to go.

41:27.782 --> 41:29.608

forgotten, either.

41:30.608 --> 41:32.043
Oorah.

41:36.652 --> 41:38.521
Hey, guys.
Hey.

41:38.565 --> 41:39.608

Hey!

41:39.652 --> 41:41.043
What's up, Palmer?

41:41.086 --> 41:43.000

41:43.043 --> 41:45.521
