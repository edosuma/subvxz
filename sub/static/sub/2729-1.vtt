00:59.400 --> 01:01.110
How we doing, Richard?

01:01.190 --> 01:04.280
We should pass over the English coast
15 minutes ahead of time, sir.

01:04.360 --> 01:07.450
Well, with this load on our
back, that's good going.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.580
Just trust the RAF, sir.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.870
- What the hell is that?
- The shuttle ignition.

02:04.930 --> 02:08.590
Disappeared? And what
happened to the Moonraker?

02:11.430 --> 02:13.100
Good God.

02:15.020 --> 02:17.980
Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away.

02:24.690 --> 02:28.490
Moneypenny, is 007 back
from that African job?

02:28.570 --> 02:29.870
He's on his last leg, sir.

02:37.620 --> 02:41.290
Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.510
I don't think I'm ever going
to fly with anyone else.

02:48.590 --> 02:50.640
You're so right, Mr. Bond.

02:59.230 --> 03:00.810
This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.150
A little premature, isn't it?

03:08.240 --> 03:09.820
Enjoy your flight.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.760
- Good morning, Moneypenny.
- James.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.260
But why are you so late?

09:02.340 --> 09:05.640
I fell out of an airplane
without a parachute.

09:05.720 --> 09:09.010
- Who's in there?
- Q and the Minister of Defense.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.770
You don't believe me, do you?

09:10.850 --> 09:14.190
- And you should go right in.
- Yes, Moneypenny.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.320
- 007. At last.
- Good morning, sir.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.990
I think you know Frederick
Gray, Minister of Defense.

09:24.070 --> 09:25.740
- Commander.
- Minister. Q.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.370
007.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.950
Moonraker?

09:32.040 --> 09:35.960
- What do you know about Moonraker?
- What I read in the newspaper, sir.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.040
Then you'll know that
Moonraker, the space shuttle,

09:38.130 --> 09:39.130
was being flown over here

09:39.210 --> 09:41.630
on loan from the Americans
on the back of a 747.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.880
Yes, which crashed somewhere in the Yukon,

09:43.970 --> 09:46.180
aircraft and shuttle totally
destroyed, correct?

09:46.260 --> 09:50.260
- That's the official version.
- The truth is rather more disturbing, 007.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.970
Look at this.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.610
Now, that's the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn over a large area.

10:02.690 --> 10:04.440
That's all that's left of the fuselage.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.450
We've been through it
with a fine-toothed comb,

10:06.530 --> 10:09.030
but there's no sign of
Moonraker, not a trace.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.620
Are you suggesting the shuttle
was hijacked in midair?

10:11.700 --> 10:13.910
That's for you to find out, 007.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.460
The shuttles are built in
California by Drax Industries.

10:16.540 --> 10:21.420
Yes. We were responsible for the
safety of that shuttle, Commander.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.670
The United States government
is justifiably concerned.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.590
I can imagine. Then, California
must be the place to start.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.680
- I agree.
- Don't make any mistakes, 007.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.270
The situation is critical. We've
got to find that shuttle.

10:35.350 --> 10:36.770
Yes, sir.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.440
If that's all, gentlemen...

10:39.560 --> 10:43.030
Just a minute, 007. I've
got something for you.

10:45.450 --> 10:48.740
Roll up your right sleeve, will you?

10:48.820 --> 10:51.740
This is now being issued
as standard equipment.

10:51.830 --> 10:53.790
Strap it on your wrist.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.420
It's activated by nerve impulses
from the wrist muscles.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.840
Like this?

11:05.210 --> 11:07.720
Oh, thank you, 007.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.220
- Be careful, will you?
- Yes, Q.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.430
Ten darts, five blue-tipped
with armor piercing heads,

11:13.510 --> 11:17.730
five red-tipped, cyanide coated,
causing death in 30 seconds.

11:17.810 --> 11:21.730
Very novel, Q. You must get them
in the stores for Christmas.

11:21.810 --> 11:23.770
Good morning, gentlemen.

11:35.700 --> 11:39.500
- Welcome to California, Mr. Bond.
- I like it already.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.180
My name is Corinne Dufour.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.930
Oh, and you're going to be showing
me around, are you, Corinne?

11:56.020 --> 12:00.270
No. I'm just a humble pilot in the
service of the Drax Corporation.

12:10.610 --> 12:16.030
This is the Drax estate now. Everything
you see belongs to Mr. Drax.

12:16.660 --> 12:20.580
- Owns a lot, doesn't he?
- What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.710
We're approaching the main complex now.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.630
That's where the Moonraker shuttle is made?

12:31.720 --> 12:34.640
That's right, workshops, hangars,

12:34.720 --> 12:38.850
design and experimental blocks,
test centers, everything.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.390
Very impressive.

12:50.820 --> 12:54.740
I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed
with the conquest of space.

12:54.870 --> 12:59.490
Now, I can believe it. Good Lord.

13:07.130 --> 13:11.420
The Drax residence. Every
stone brought from France.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.680
- Cute, isn't it?
- Magnificent.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.510
Why didn't he buy the Eiffel Tower as well?

13:17.600 --> 13:21.220
He did, but the French government
refused him an export permit.

13:38.660 --> 13:41.750
Look there. Those are
the astronaut trainees.

13:41.830 --> 13:46.420
Mr. Drax is financing the entire
training program out of his own pocket.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.590
He seems to have an eye
for a good investment.

14:10.110 --> 14:14.150
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in
the drawing room, Miss Dufour.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.530
- Thank you, Cavendish.
- This way, please, sir.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.200
Mr. Bond, sir.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.990
- Mr. Bond.
- Mr. Drax.

15:04.750 --> 15:08.370
Allow me to present, before they
leave us, Countess Lubinski,

15:08.460 --> 15:11.420
Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.960
How do you do?

15:16.050 --> 15:20.260
Well, my dear fellow, your
reputation precedes you, of course.

15:20.340 --> 15:24.720
I'm honored that your government should
send you on so delicate a mission.

15:24.810 --> 15:26.220
Delicate, Mr. Drax?

15:26.310 --> 15:30.270
Well, to apologize in person for
the loss of my space shuttle.

15:31.730 --> 15:35.190
How would Oscar Wilde have put it?

15:35.280 --> 15:39.490
"To lose one aircraft may be
regarded as a misfortune,"

15:40.660 --> 15:43.580
"to lose two seems like carelessness."

15:47.040 --> 15:51.080
Well, an apology will be made to
the American government, Mr. Drax,

15:51.170 --> 15:55.300
when we've discovered why there was no
trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage.

15:55.380 --> 15:59.420
And your loyalty commands
respect, Mr. Bond.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.600
You have arrived at a propitious moment,

16:03.680 --> 16:07.020
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution

16:07.100 --> 16:09.930
to Western civilization.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.770
Afternoon tea.

16:12.610 --> 16:17.400
- May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?
- Thank you, no, nothing at all.

16:17.490 --> 16:20.320
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?

16:20.400 --> 16:23.030
No. I own a number of subsidiaries
throughout the world,

16:23.120 --> 16:24.870
producing components.

16:24.950 --> 16:28.040
The conquest of space represents
an investment in the future

16:28.120 --> 16:31.250
of the entire human race, Mr. Bond.

16:31.330 --> 16:36.840
It is, therefore, logical to seek out
the best that each nation has to offer.

16:36.920 --> 16:42.720
- Are you referring to people or skills?
- Both, Mr. Bond.

16:52.310 --> 16:56.060
- Am I too soon?
- Not at all.

16:56.150 --> 16:59.480
I'm sure Mr. Bond is
eager to start his tour.

16:59.570 --> 17:03.240
Miss Dufour will escort you to
Dr. Goodhead who will show you around.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.450
Ask anything you like.

17:05.530 --> 17:09.040
- Thank you for being so cooperative.
- A pleasure.

17:19.300 --> 17:25.180
Look after Mr. Bond. See
that some harm comes to him.

17:28.930 --> 17:31.520
You'll find Dr. Goodhead
first on the right.

17:31.640 --> 17:36.020
- Oh. Thank you for the ride.
- Call on me if you need anything.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.210
Good afternoon.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.800
- Can I help you?
- Yes. My name is Bond.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.590
James Bond. I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.

18:06.680 --> 18:10.310
- You just found her.
- A woman.

18:11.390 --> 18:15.190
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.230
James, to my friends.

18:18.150 --> 18:19.730
Holly Goodhead.

18:20.690 --> 18:25.030
- Are you training to be an astronaut?
- I'm fully trained.

18:25.110 --> 18:28.160
On loan from NASA, the
Space Administration.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.830
Well, Mr. Bond, I guess
we'd better get started.

18:32.910 --> 18:37.120
You don't want to lose time as
well as a space shuttle, do you?

18:44.550 --> 18:46.550
This is it, the Moonraker.

18:46.630 --> 18:49.050
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...

18:49.140 --> 18:51.350
Orbiting the Earth and reentering
the atmosphere to land

18:51.430 --> 18:53.810
like any conventional aircraft.

19:00.020 --> 19:03.020
This is the centrifuge training.

19:03.110 --> 19:07.740
It simulates the gravity force
you feel when shot into space.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.790
The speed is controlled by the
instructor from up there.

19:15.870 --> 19:17.960
Why not try it?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.460
Why not?

19:27.470 --> 19:31.590
- Strap yourself in firmly.
- Yes, Doctor.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.680
Now your arms.

19:35.770 --> 19:38.230
That's to prevent you from
knocking yourself out.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.600
I see.

19:46.690 --> 19:49.780
How fast does it go?

19:50.990 --> 19:54.080
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.910
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Most people pass out at seven.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.580
You make a great saleswoman.

20:02.670 --> 20:06.710
You don't have to worry. This is
what we call a "Chicken Switch."

20:06.800 --> 20:08.880
You just keep your finger on that button,

20:08.970 --> 20:11.430
the moment the pressure gets too
much for you, release the button

20:11.510 --> 20:14.930
- and the power's cut off.
- Just like that?

20:15.010 --> 20:19.390
Come on, Mr. Bond. A 70-
year-old can take 3 Gs.

20:19.480 --> 20:24.110
Well, the trouble is there is never a
70- year-old around when you need one.

20:30.070 --> 20:32.860
- You want me?
- Mr. Drax says to telephone him.

20:32.950 --> 20:38.660
All right, I'll call him from my office.
You go ahead. I'll be right back.

20:38.750 --> 20:42.750
The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.

20:51.590 --> 20:54.430
Yes. We're taking good care of him.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.750
I don't know what could've happened.

23:27.830 --> 23:30.920
Something must've gone
wrong with the controls.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.600
Let me help you.

24:19.010 --> 24:23.260
My mother gave me a list of
things not to do on a first date.

24:23.350 --> 24:26.930
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.

24:27.020 --> 24:30.100
No. What do you want then?

24:32.690 --> 24:37.400
Would your feelings be shattered
if I were to say information?

24:37.480 --> 24:41.740
- Why should I tell you anything?
- Why, indeed?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.660
You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond.

25:06.140 --> 25:09.220
What goes on here besides the
manufacture of Moonraker?

25:09.310 --> 25:11.930
And the astronaut training program?

25:12.020 --> 25:16.560
There are other laboratories,
but not much is happening now.

25:16.650 --> 25:18.480
No?

25:18.570 --> 25:23.700
They were working on something very
secret, but everything's been moved.

25:23.780 --> 25:25.700
Where to?

25:28.040 --> 25:30.540
I don't know.

25:35.750 --> 25:39.630
What about that list of your mother's?

25:39.710 --> 25:42.340
I never learned to read.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.980
What are you doing?

26:43.070 --> 26:46.610
You whetted my appetite for information.

26:46.700 --> 26:50.120
Is there a safe in here? Thank you.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.330
James, no.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.250
That's amazing.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.670
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.460
Eighteen karat.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.420
You must go.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.550
Well, you go first. I'll
turn off the lights.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.550
Thank you.

28:42.190 --> 28:45.230
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.

30:22.870 --> 30:24.790
My dear Bond.

30:24.870 --> 30:29.920
This is Mademoiselle Deladier
and La Signorina del Mateo.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.380
- Ladies.
- I'll see you at lunch.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.050
A pity you leave us. Such good sport.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.640
Unless you're a pheasant.

30:40.720 --> 30:45.230
Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun,
a stray bird may fly over.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.690
I only stopped to thank
you for your hospitality.

30:47.770 --> 30:51.270
Fraser will get you to the
airport in plenty of time.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.070
Come now.

31:13.670 --> 31:17.470
- I doubt if I'm in your class.
- Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.520
Over there.

31:35.150 --> 31:37.070
You missed, Mr. Bond.

31:39.570 --> 31:40.860
Did I?

31:42.830 --> 31:46.540
As you said, such good sport.

32:09.890 --> 32:12.810
You called for me, Mr. Drax.

32:12.900 --> 32:15.020
You were with Bond last night in my study.

32:15.110 --> 32:16.110
No, I...

32:16.190 --> 32:18.320
- You showed him the safe.
- I didn't.

32:18.400 --> 32:22.240
I'm terminating your employment.
You will leave immediately.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.830
Franco, I'll call you to
tell you where to meet me.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.610
Could I interest you in something?

34:19.690 --> 34:22.480
Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately.

34:22.570 --> 34:25.110
But I think maybe I'd
better have a look around.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.699
Please. Go anywhere you wish.

35:10.950 --> 35:14.240
And in 1955, the Venini
Museum and Glass Works

35:14.330 --> 35:16.160
was taken over by Drax Industries.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.790
And here, ladies and gentlemen, we
have some of the rarest examples

35:19.880 --> 35:21.380
of the glassblower's art.

35:21.460 --> 35:25.090
As you know, everything was
done absolutely by hand.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.010
Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati,

35:28.090 --> 35:33.600
sometime between 1850 and 1860. If
you'd like to follow me over here.

35:36.020 --> 35:42.020
This exquisite bowl was fashioned
about 1520, over 450 years ago.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.070
If it ever came on the market,
it would certainly fetch a price

35:45.150 --> 35:48.360
in excess of one million American dollars.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.990
But if any of you are
thinking of taking it...

35:53.410 --> 35:56.200
Now, we have here a very
early 17th century dish

35:56.290 --> 35:57.960
with an aquamarine medallion.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.880
Over here, we have something
very, very interesting.

36:02.540 --> 36:04.340
This glass-handled sword,

36:04.420 --> 36:07.920
the only one of its kind in the world,

36:08.010 --> 36:11.720
was owned by General Menotti
in the late 18th century

36:11.800 --> 36:13.010
and is the work of Bruno...

36:46.340 --> 36:48.300
14th century.

36:52.180 --> 36:54.220
Dr. Goodhead.

36:54.300 --> 36:57.810
I can only hope your presence
here is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.

36:57.890 --> 37:02.020
- I dislike being spied on.
- Well, don't we all?

37:02.650 --> 37:04.610
You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you?

37:04.690 --> 37:08.940
- Yes. How did you know?
- Well, I like to keep abreast of things.

37:09.990 --> 37:13.280
May I ask what you're doing in Venice?

37:13.360 --> 37:16.830
I'm addressing a seminar of the
European Space Commission.

37:16.910 --> 37:18.870
My, heavy stuff.

37:18.950 --> 37:21.080
But there again, I keep
forgetting that you are

37:21.160 --> 37:23.870
more than just a very beautiful woman.

37:24.710 --> 37:28.130
If you're trying to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.

37:28.210 --> 37:30.130
I have more important things on my mind.

37:30.210 --> 37:32.300
That's what I'd like to talk to you about.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.260
- Dinner this evening?
- This evening I'm giving my address.

37:35.890 --> 37:39.720
Well, then, can you think of reason
why we don't have a drink afterwards?

37:39.810 --> 37:42.560
Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall.

37:46.940 --> 37:48.270
Franco.

49:02.610 --> 49:04.410
Play it again, Sam.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.360
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Convalescing.

49:39.440 --> 49:42.150
Your friend Cha just tried to kill me.

49:43.320 --> 49:44.990
And you think I had
something to do with it?

49:45.070 --> 49:47.740
Well, the thought had
flashed across my mind.

49:49.910 --> 49:54.330
- What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

49:56.750 --> 50:00.710
- You leaving me your telephone number?
- I don't see the point.

50:02.670 --> 50:04.760
Now I do.

50:06.890 --> 50:09.470
Not what I want to get stuck with tonight.

50:11.890 --> 50:15.230
James, why don't you pour yourself a drink?

50:15.310 --> 50:16.900
Thank you.

50:20.320 --> 50:22.320
Daily diary.

50:27.830 --> 50:30.160
Fairly deadly diary.

50:31.700 --> 50:35.580
Bollinger. If it's '69,
you were expecting me.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.480
Trifle overpowering, your scent.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.820
Standard CIA equipment.

51:09.910 --> 51:12.700
And the CIA placed you with Drax, correct?

51:12.790 --> 51:15.460
- Very astute of you, James.
- Oh, not really.

51:15.540 --> 51:17.540
I have friends in low places.

51:17.620 --> 51:21.380
Could this possibly be the moment
for us to pool our resources?

51:22.550 --> 51:24.880
It could have its compensations.

51:38.900 --> 51:41.730
Where are you planning on going from here?

51:41.820 --> 51:44.570
I'm not planning on going anywhere.

51:46.700 --> 51:51.740
Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly. We
would be better off working together.

51:51.830 --> 51:54.830
- Detente?
- Agreed.

51:54.910 --> 51:57.710
- Understanding?
- Possibly.

51:58.870 --> 52:01.790
- Cooperation?
- Maybe.

52:02.750 --> 52:05.090
- Trust?
- Out of the question.

52:39.040 --> 52:42.630
Send the night porter up for
my bags immediately, please.

52:49.220 --> 52:53.340
I hope you know what you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge with this fellow Drax.

52:53.430 --> 52:57.060
007 doesn't usually push the panic
button unless it's something serious.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.430
- I should hope not.
- Good morning, Inspector.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.140
- Good morning.
- I see you've covered everything

53:00.230 --> 53:02.810
- with our Italian friends.
- Yes, sir.

53:15.490 --> 53:17.410
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.460
Gas masks?

53:22.540 --> 53:25.590
We can't afford to take
any chances, Minister.

54:00.040 --> 54:02.790
Frederick Gray. What a surprise.

54:02.870 --> 54:06.380
And in distinguished company,
all wearing gas masks.

54:07.960 --> 54:10.130
You must excuse me,
gentlemen, not being English,

54:10.210 --> 54:14.300
I sometimes find your sense of
humor rather difficult to follow.

54:18.560 --> 54:22.390
On behalf of the British
government, I apologize.

54:24.770 --> 54:27.650
I think you owe us an explanation, 007.

54:28.730 --> 54:31.940
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

54:32.030 --> 54:34.320
Your man should be taken
off the assignment.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.450
I'll see you at the consulate.

54:37.370 --> 54:39.620
I'll have to do what he says.

54:39.700 --> 54:44.460
Well, before you do that, sir,
have Q do an analysis of this.

54:45.790 --> 54:47.580
I took it from the laboratory.

54:47.670 --> 54:51.250
Tell him to exercise extreme caution.
It is lethal.

54:52.590 --> 54:54.840
So, there was a laboratory.

54:56.930 --> 54:59.930
You better take two weeks
leave of absence, 007.

55:01.100 --> 55:03.470
Do have any thoughts about
where you might go?

55:03.560 --> 55:07.560
I've always had a hankering
to go to Rio, sir.

55:07.650 --> 55:10.520
I think I can recall your mentioning it.

55:10.610 --> 55:15.400
007, no slipups or we're both in trouble.

55:22.040 --> 55:24.950
Yes, a minor crisis has been averted.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.500
No, no, nothing serious,
but all merchandise

55:27.580 --> 55:30.750
is to be rerouted as from today.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.670
Now, regarding a replacement for Cha,

55:33.760 --> 55:36.880
do you have someone in mind?

55:36.970 --> 55:39.390
Oh, yes, well, if you
can get him, of course.

55:39.850 --> 55:45.930
Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro
now boarding, gate number seven.

56:19.510 --> 56:21.550
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.

57:03.720 --> 57:06.810
- The President Suite.
- Really?

57:08.020 --> 57:11.730
Well, don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost, I'll take a cab.

57:29.750 --> 57:33.500
- Do you come with the suite?
- It depends who's renting it.

57:33.580 --> 57:36.250
Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred.

57:38.260 --> 57:40.590
Why were you following me from the airport?

57:40.670 --> 57:44.050
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.

57:44.140 --> 57:48.220
I work for Station VH. We have
been asked to assist you.

57:48.310 --> 57:50.680
M thinks of everything.

57:50.770 --> 57:54.140
Tell me, Manuela, do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?

57:54.270 --> 57:58.980
C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg.

57:59.070 --> 58:01.190
They are very big importers in Rio.

58:01.280 --> 58:04.200
A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.

58:04.280 --> 58:07.370
They have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue.

58:07.450 --> 58:09.580
I'd like to pay it a
discreet visit tonight.

58:09.660 --> 58:14.120
Tonight? I think you may find
that a little difficult.

58:14.210 --> 58:18.750
Difficult or not, it's
something we have to do.

58:18.840 --> 58:21.210
And meanwhile,

58:21.300 --> 58:25.970
how do you kill five hours
in Rio if you don't samba?

58:52.000 --> 58:55.960
- There's the warehouse.
- And not a soul about.

58:56.040 --> 58:59.540
- I think there's a way around the back.
- Good thinking.

59:33.080 --> 59:34.540
This is it.

59:35.540 --> 59:38.670
Don't talk to any strange men.
I'll be back.

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:35.800
- Are you all right?
- Yes, but I'd rather dance with you.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:39.100
I did tell you not to
talk to any strange men.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.640
- Did you find anything in there?
- Only this.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.020
"Drax Air Freight."

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:48.560
Do you know which airport
they operate from?

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:52.030
Yes. San Pietro. Do you
want me to take you there?

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:54.820
No, I think you need some rest.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.660
- Come on. I'll drop you off.
- Okay.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:32.420
- Haven't we met before somewhere?
- The face is familiar, as is the manner.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.260
It's become distinctly chilly since Venice.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.170
Well, that was before you walked out on me.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.220
Yes, nearly tripping over your
suitcase on the way through the door.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.590
So?

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.600
So why waste time working
against each other?

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.980
I've checked Drax's warehouse in town.
It's empty.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.480
That's no surprise. Since I've been here,

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.940
those planes have been
taking off every two hours.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.320
- Yes. He's moving out.
- Where to?

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.450
That's what we're going to find out,

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.870
now that we're working together.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:13.580
- I still don't know if I trust you.
- I don't know if I trust you either.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:18.090
That's what makes it more
exciting, doesn't it?

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.960
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.920
But I'm sure we're better off out than in.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.590
Bring that chain.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.950
- Hang on, James.
- The thought had occurred to me.

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.040
I might have guessed.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.580
- Do you know him?
- Not socially.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.170
His name's Jaws. He kills people.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:30.069
Here, give me the chain.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.000
Come on. Hang on to me.

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:21.960
Jump.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.780
- Have you broken something?
- Only my tailor's heart.

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:39.950
- What was that for?
- For saving my life.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.290
Remind me to do it more often.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.720
Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.790
Sorry about that.

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:08.160
James! You look as though you've
just fallen off a mountain.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.620
Well, it's funny you should
say that, Moneypenny.

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.460
As a matter of fact, I was
in a cable car and...

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.250
- Never mind.
- The other courtyard.

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:24.800
- There you are, 007.
- Balls, Q?

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:26.760
Bolas, 007.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.650
- Good. Have that ready for Army Day.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.610
- Where's M?
- He's in the office over there.

01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:59.340
This way.

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.670
- Good morning, 007.
- Good morning, sir.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.470
- You're just in time. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.970
- Q's come up with something.
- Splendid.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:16.190
- Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
- Afraid not. Right, Q.

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:20.190
Well, it's a breakdown on that phial
of liquid you picked up in Venice.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:23.110
- You know, you seem to be right, 007.
- Thank you.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:28.030
It's a highly toxic nerve gas that
appears to have no effect on animals.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.330
May I see the formula?

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:41.420
It's a chemical formula of a plant.

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:47.720
Orchideae anegra. A very
rare orchid indeed.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.090
Yes. It was thought to be extinct.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:54.220
Until a missionary brought one back
from the upper reaches of the Amazoco.

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:57.270
Well, actually he brought it back
from the area of the River Tapirape.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:01.270
Well done, James. You better
get up there and fast.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.440
And I've got something to get him there,
if 007 can be trusted to look after it.

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:16.680
Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts
to plan an amusing death for you.

01:24:17.690 --> 01:24:19.400
You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.570
Why did you break off the
encounter with my pet python?

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:25.190
I discovered he had a crush on me.

01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:27.320
Jaws.

01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:42.380
Moonraker One on preset launch
program, minus two minutes.

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.840
Retract crew access arm.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.260
CAA retracted.

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:51.090
- Transfer orbiter power.
- Internal power transferred.

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.050
Activate hydraulics.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:56.890
- Hydraulics activated.
- Activate auxiliary power unit.

01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:01.060
- APU activated.
- LH2 replenish.

01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:05.270
- Status confirmed.
- Pressurize MPS helium tanks.

01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:07.990
Helium flight pressure confirmed.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.490
What exactly are you up to here, Drax?

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:16.490
- And why the orchids?
- The curse of a civilization.

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:19.500
It was neither war nor pestilence
that wiped out the race

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.000
who built the great city lying around us.

01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:26.420
It was their reverence
for this lovely flower.

01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:31.050
Because long-term exposure to
its pollen caused sterility.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:33.430
Correct, Mr. Bond.

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:37.260
As you discovered, I have
improved upon sterility.

01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:40.940
Those same seeds now yield death.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:46.690
Not, of course, to animals or plant life.
One must preserve the balance of nature.

01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.400
Moonraker launch program now commencing.

01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:50.990
Minus 20 seconds.

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:54.530
- SRB gimbal profile.
- Activated.

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.870
- Cooling pumps.
- On.

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:58.790
- IMU to inertial.
- IMU confirmed.

01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:01.000
Moonraker One, liftoff.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.300
We have liftoff.

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:17.050
Moonraker Two, T minus ten,
nine, eight, seven, six,

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:23.020
five, four, three, two, one.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.270
Main engine start.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.230
Moonraker Two, liftoff.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.120
- Moonraker Three.
- Moonraker Three, liftoff.

01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:39.990
- Moonraker Two, confirm program pitch.
- PP confirmed.

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.580
Moonraker Four on preset launch program.

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:44.620
Moonraker Four, liftoff.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.500
Moonraker One, SRB jettison.

01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:52.840
We have separation. Confirmed.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.010
Moonraker Three, confirm program pitch.

01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:59.220
Moonraker Five, on preset launch program.

01:26:59.310 --> 01:27:02.600
- Minus ten...
- Drax, one more thing.

01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:05.270
You delivered a shuttle to the U.S.
government,

01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:08.150
then you hijacked it. Why?

01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:11.980
Because I needed it.

01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:16.360
One of my own Moonrakers developed
a fault during assembly.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.990
Now, you have distracted me enough.

01:27:20.370 --> 01:27:24.460
Jaws, Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim.

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.290
Place him where he can
be assured of warmth.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.960
- Confirmed.
- Moonraker Two, go for orbit.

01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:33.010
Velocity, 1,000 feet per second.

01:27:33.090 --> 01:27:35.970
- All systems...
- SRB jettison.

01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:38.550
Separation motors fired.

01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:43.350
Moonraker Five, cleared for launch.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.610
James.

01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:04.910
Thank God, you're safe.

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.920
Moonraker Five, transfer orbiter power.

01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:25.640
Hydraulics activated.

01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:29.980
- Activate auxiliary power unit.
- APU activated.

01:28:30.690 --> 01:28:32.730
- LH2 replenish.
- Confirm.

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.110
Even in death, my munificence is boundless.

01:28:36.190 --> 01:28:38.570
When this rocket lifts off,

01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:41.820
I shall be leaving you in
your own private crematorium.

01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:46.790
Mr. Bond, Dr. Goodhead, I bid you farewell.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.630
- EPS, power on.
- EPS, power confirmed.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.720
Come on, the air vent.

01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:06.560
Fuel tanks go, and go.

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:15.690
Moonraker Five, preset.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.280
External LH2 pressure.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.160
- Retract crew access arm.
- CAA retracted.

01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:27.700
Get back quick.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:35.500
T minus ten seconds, nine,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.050
seven,

01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:40.590
- six, five, four...
- Bang on time.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.680
- Four, three, two...
- Come on, quick.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.470
Straight on.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:04.160
Moonraker Six, astro-technicians
prepare to embark.

01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:12.000
I repeat, Moonraker Six
astro-technicians, prepare to embark.

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:20.340
- Moonraker Five crew.
- All systems go.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:27.850
Moonraker Six, start launch sequence.

01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:34.060
- Go for orbit.
- Confirm.

01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:37.980
We have separation.

01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:41.280
Moonraker Five ground crew stand down.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.780
Thrust 6.8 million pounds.

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:04.170
We're going the wrong way.

01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:14.730
Moonraker Six, preset
launch program completed.

01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:17.600
Pilots proceed from base to launch area.

01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:34.040
Shuttle go. Boosters go.

01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:37.250
Launch pad go.

01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:41.670
- External LO2 pressure?
- Confirmed, 21 psia.

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:47.090
- External LH2 pressure?
- Confirmed, 42.5 psia.

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:49.890
- IECF to internal power.
- CAA retracted.

01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:53.850
Moonraker Six cleared for launch.
T minus 10 seconds.

01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:59.730
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:03.110
three, two, one, go.

01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:06.740
It's all right. We're on a
prearranged flight program.

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:59.290
That's Drax in Moonraker Five.

01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:16.520
- What about the others?
- I don't know. Let's see.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.810
We're all on parallel courses.

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.730
So, we must be headed for
a rendezvous in orbit.

01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:15.700
Let's see what cargo we have.

01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:29.710
- The animals went in two by two.
- What do you mean by that?

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.220
Noah's Ark. This operation.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.620
We're converging.

01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.170
- Control rockets?
- Yes, we're slowing down.

01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:19.850
What's that?

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.510
There's no image on the radar scanner.

01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:15.240
An entire city in space and still
nothing on the radar scanner.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.320
- So nobody on Earth knows it's there.
- Right.

01:36:21.450 --> 01:36:24.080
Drax must have a radar-jamming system.

01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.830
All Moonrakers prepare to
initiate docking procedures

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.090
and continue radio silence.

01:36:57.530 --> 01:37:02.370
Moonraker Six, you are now in manual.
Initiate docking sequence.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:22.390
All shuttles now docked. Execute
station activation procedure.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.070
Gravity, normal conditions.
Life-support system, nominal.

01:39:01.690 --> 01:39:05.490
Moonraker Six technicians,
commence operational sequence.

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.870
- Sequence four initiated.
- Check airlock seals.

01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:10.910
ALS secure.

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.550
All personnel to Command satellite.

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.760
All personnel to Command satellite.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.010
All crews to M5 segment.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:34.810
Moonraker Six technicians to M2 segment.

01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:38.190
Moonraker One and Three to M1 segment.

01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:42.860
Moonraker Four and Five to M4 segment.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:46.030
Moonraker Two to M5 segment.

01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:51.280
Units four and seven,
man console as planned.

01:39:51.370 --> 01:39:56.540
Units one, three, five and six,
assume pre-assigned stations.

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.920
- Pressure on-line?
- Confirmed.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.880
- Life support?
- Normal.

01:40:05.630 --> 01:40:09.970
Those are the globes I saw in Venice
with the nerve gas phials inside.

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:19.480
First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.

01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:24.230
Here in the untainted cradle of the heavens

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:27.400
will be created a new super-race,

01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:32.160
a race of perfect physical specimens.

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:37.250
You have been selected as
its progenitors, like gods.

01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:42.290
Your offspring will return to Earth
and shape it in their image.

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:47.050
You have all served in humble
capacities in my terrestrial empire.

01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:49.260
Your seed, like yourselves,

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:55.310
will pay deference to the ultimate
dynasty which I alone have created.

01:40:55.390 --> 01:41:00.230
From their first day on Earth
they will be able to look up

01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:05.860
and know that there is law
and order in the heavens.

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:11.240
All units, start Operation Orchid.

01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:19.160
If we were visible from
Earth, they'd investigate.

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:22.170
Where do you suppose that
radar-jamming system is?

01:41:22.250 --> 01:41:26.170
We didn't pass anything on the
way here, so let's try this way.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.510
Station two, check coordinates, mode four.

01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:35.640
Initiate globe launch timing sequence.

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:38.890
Orbital communicator, level 10.
Zero gravity.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.590
This is it, the radar-jamming system.

01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:14.340
- Coordinate conversion program.
- Check.

01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:17.930
- Side lobe gain.
- Check.

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.730
- Spectral response.
- Check.

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:26.860
- Spin stabilizer correction factor.
- Okay.

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.280
Gigahertz reflector efficiency.

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.450
Solar photon screen.

01:42:55.090 --> 01:42:57.390
Where did you learn to
fight like that? NASA?

01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:58.850
No, Vassar.

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:11.610
- Switched off?
- Permanently.

01:43:11.690 --> 01:43:13.030
Now we can be spotted from Earth.

01:43:17.490 --> 01:43:21.580
- This doesn't look good at all.
- It's over 200 meters in diameter.

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:24.080
Yes, yes.

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:27.380
Will you please listen, General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:32.550
Neither did we, Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?

01:43:32.630 --> 01:43:36.380
We've taken action already. We're
sending up a vehicle to intercept.

01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:40.100
Very well, but if we don't hear
from you in the next 12 hours

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.850
we take action ourselves and hold you
responsible for the consequences.

01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:47.900
We'll be in touch, General.

01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:51.020
- Sorry to have woken you.
- I was already awake.

01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:56.400
How can I sleep? Nothing but problems.

01:43:56.490 --> 01:43:59.410
Problems, problems.

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.950
Marine astronauts to launch pad.

01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:16.380
- Launch pre-program complete, sir.
- Launch globe number one.

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:17.570
T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir.
Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg.

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:24.950
There are no launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:29.080
Well?

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.380
Jamming power supply and
backup have failed, sir.

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:36.340
- Investigate immediately.
- Investigate number 28, immediately.

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:40.630
James Bond.

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:45.970
You appear with the tedious
inevitability of an unloved season.

01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:48.850
I didn't think there were
any seasons in space.

01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:52.400
As far as you're concerned, only winter.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.480
And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead.

01:45:55.570 --> 01:46:00.320
Despite your efforts, my finely wrought
dream approaches its fulfillment.

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:05.070
Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare
it is, hasn't a chance, Drax.

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:08.290
You think not? We shall see.

01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:10.870
We're coming up to second launch position.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.920
Launch globe number two.

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:28.640
No doubt you have realized the
splendor of my conception.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.270
First, a necklace of death about the Earth.

01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:38.320
50 globes, each releasing its
nerve gas over a designated area,

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.450
each capable of killing 100 million people.

01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:48.240
And the human race as you
know it will cease to exist.

01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:52.960
Then a rebirth, a new world.

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.750
U.S. spacecraft on course
to intercept us, sir.

01:46:57.630 --> 01:47:01.210
Activate laser. Prepare
to destroy spacecraft.

01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:20.570
You see, my dear Bond, we're well able to
protect ourselves against all enemies.

01:47:23.150 --> 01:47:27.870
Allow me to introduce you
to the airlock chamber.

01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:33.000
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route
from this world to the next.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.340
And you, Dr. Goodhead.

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:44.130
Your desire to be America's
first woman in space

01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:46.180
will shortly be fulfilled.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:51.680
Leaving you on your flying stud farm,
conceiving your new master race?

01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:53.980
If you like, yes.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:59.440
And of course, anyone not measuring up
to your standards of physical perfection

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:03.440
- will be exterminated.
- Certainly.

01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.700
Interesting.

01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:10.160
Most interesting.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.290
Jaws, expel them.

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.460
Jaws! You obey me!

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:29.140
Expel them!

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:43.360
Hold them!

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:49.820
Sir, U.S. spacecraft, three
minutes to intercept.

01:48:50.530 --> 01:48:52.330
Stand by to laser it.

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:04.840
- Initiate firing sequence.
- Initiating.

01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:09.340
U.S. spacecraft in laser
range, 25.5 and closing.

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:12.260
Range 15.

01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:13.680
Range 10.

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.020
Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two...

01:49:46.050 --> 01:49:47.210
It's stopped rotating.

01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:26.380
Open the cargo doors.

01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:35.510
Number one platoon, EVA.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600
Number one platoon, EVA.

01:51:35.490 --> 01:51:36.610
Let's try docking.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:15.320
Colonel Scott will take the first landing!

01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:18.530
Intruders have docked at
satellite seven, sir.

01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:22.200
Double the guard at every
entrance in this satellite.

01:52:22.330 --> 01:52:25.120
Report intruders' progress
throughout the space station.

01:52:25.210 --> 01:52:27.410
Number three globe ready
for launching, sir.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:28.540
Proceed!

01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:42.760
Group One, attack enemy.
All units shoot to kill.

01:52:51.230 --> 01:52:53.230
- Colonel Scott, don't shoot.
- Hold your fire.

01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:58.820
Corridor five penetrated. Intruders
advancing on Command satellite.

01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:01.280
Maintenance crew needed, section three.

01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:12.350
At least I shall have the pleasure
of putting you out of my misery.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.190
Desolated, Mr. Bond?

01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:23.410
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.

01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:26.950
Allow me.

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:31.460
Take a giant step for mankind.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:50.720
- Where's Drax?
- He had to fly.

01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.560
How's Scott doing?

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.810
He's got control of the Command satellite.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:56.230
We put the launching gear for
the globes out of action.

01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:59.690
When the station breaks up, they'll disintegrate.
They'll harm no one.

01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:01.820
But the three that have gone,
they'll kill millions.

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:04.240
Those three must be destroyed.

01:55:16.290 --> 01:55:17.540
Come on!

01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:26.720
Colonel, get your men off
as quickly as possible.

01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.850
Your mission is completed.

01:55:28.930 --> 01:55:31.600
Sergeant, round up your men, get
them back to the shuttle. Fast!

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.980
Back to the shuttle, everybody!
On the double!

01:55:59.710 --> 01:56:02.670
Moonraker Five, that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser.

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.220
We can track those globes and destroy them.

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:10.760
It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.

01:56:10.890 --> 01:56:12.640
All right, let's go.

01:57:00.810 --> 01:57:02.860
Docking release system is jammed.

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.560
Release the door lock. I'll see
if I can operate it manually.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:36.220
It's jammed too.

01:57:51.450 --> 01:57:53.240
Well, here's to us.

01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:13.050
Jaws, we can't disengage. The
docking release system is jammed.

01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:15.100
Can you help us?

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:41.000
We're free.

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:00.430
Don't worry, they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:02.100
Let's get a read-out on those globes.

01:59:24.210 --> 01:59:28.790
I have the three globes on the screen.
We should have a visual in a minute.

01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:38.890
There it is.

01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:46.650
The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set.

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:03.950
One down, two to go.

02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:09.840
Number two straight ahead.

02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:18.140
What is it?

02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:20.470
We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere.

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:21.850
In range.

02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:36.360
- We should see the last one soon.
- There it is.

02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.120
- It's getting hot.
- It can't be helped.

02:00:48.210 --> 02:00:52.170
I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I
should in order to catch that last globe.

02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:04.430
I can't hold this course much longer.
We'll break up at 200,000 feet.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:06.220
Just a few seconds more.

02:01:16.530 --> 02:01:21.320
Automatic firing system negative. Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:38.340
Controls aren't responding.

02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:44.970
- The wings are beginning to glow.
- Just hold her steady.

02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:48.600
Steady.

02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:07.580
It's entering Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is our last chance.

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:12.250
Steady.

02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:34.810
Colonel Scott reports picking up two
survivors from the space station,

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.020
a tall man and a short blonde woman.

02:02:37.110 --> 02:02:39.820
Right. Okay.

02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.490
Dr. Goodhead reported their
position 20 minutes ago.

02:02:42.570 --> 02:02:45.700
They're just coming into range of our
tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean.

02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:47.240
We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes

02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:48.990
from the remote onboard TV monitors.

02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:57.420
Houston calling Dr. Goodhead. Houston calling.
Confirm your position.

02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:06.640
As this is the first joint venture
between our two countries,

02:03:07.050 --> 02:03:10.640
I'm having it patched directly to the
White House and Buckingham Palace.

02:03:10.730 --> 02:03:13.690
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.

02:03:13.770 --> 02:03:16.190
- We have audiovisual.
- At last.

02:03:26.370 --> 02:03:30.200
- 007.
- My God, what's Bond doing?

02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:32.910
I think he's attempting re-entry, sir.

02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:49.600
- James?
- I think it may be time to go home.

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.060
Take me round the world one more time.

02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:55.140
Why not?
