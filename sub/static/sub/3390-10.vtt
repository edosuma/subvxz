WEBVTT

00:57.500 --> 00:58.900
After Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa found out

00:59.266 --> 01:02.400
about the Iris and San Baek
through Seung-ryong Hong's necklace,

01:02.734 --> 01:04.266
they met Chul-young in China

01:05.633 --> 01:07.500
and became a part
of Chul-young's terrorist group,

01:07.734 --> 01:09.066
heading to South Korea.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.667
The NSS and Sa-woo sensed
the imminent terrorist attack

01:26.066 --> 01:27.367
and started to investigate.

01:33.133 --> 01:36.767
Sa-woo discovered the trace
that Hyun-jun had left in his house

01:38.567 --> 01:42.233
and instinctively realized that Hyun-jun
was associated with the terrorist group.

01:59.133 --> 02:00.867
EPISODE 10

02:49.367 --> 02:50.233
Group Two,

02:50.300 --> 02:51.166
ready to enter.

02:51.467 --> 02:52.567
Group Three, ready to enter.

02:55.066 --> 02:55.967
Move in.

03:29.767 --> 03:30.734
There's no one here.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.233
Group One, clean.

03:32.900 --> 03:33.900
Group Two, clean.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.734
It's ready, sir.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.300
When do we leave?

04:14.300 --> 04:15.200
Good.

04:15.767 --> 04:17.100
The NSS guys are in.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.233
There's something here!

04:47.667 --> 04:49.734
East Asian Foreign Ministers
Conference Schedule

05:12.600 --> 05:13.734
The warehouse is empty, sir.

05:15.266 --> 05:17.066
But I think I figured out
where their target is.

05:18.734 --> 05:19.700
I got it.

05:19.767 --> 05:21.834
I'll be taking the SWAT from here.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.467
You go over there directly.

05:23.533 --> 05:24.567
Yes, sir.

05:25.333 --> 05:26.166
Let's go.

05:28.767 --> 05:29.600
Their terror target is

05:30.200 --> 05:31.767
East Asian Foreign Ministers Conference.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.133
All right.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.367
Everybody, get ready.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.700
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

06:04.767 --> 06:07.200
Our target is not the conference.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.066
It's South Korea's National
Security Service,

06:16.367 --> 06:17.400
the NSS.

06:19.867 --> 06:20.967
Is that possible?

06:22.100 --> 06:24.133
With our current forces, it's impossible.

06:25.967 --> 06:28.867
Since they believe
that our target is the conference,

06:30.066 --> 06:33.233
they will focus
their entire combat forces there.

06:34.033 --> 06:34.900
Moreover,

06:35.834 --> 06:38.100
the delegation will arrive
from the North today

06:38.867 --> 06:40.200
to prepare for the summit.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.867
They will deploy
their forces there as well.

06:44.834 --> 06:45.900
As a result,

06:47.033 --> 06:49.133
the NSS will undergo a security vacuum.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.033
Even so,

06:51.100 --> 06:52.500
it's a national intelligence agency.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.734
It will be hard to penetrate
into the security system.

06:58.667 --> 06:59.533
We already learned

07:00.200 --> 07:02.900
everything about the NSS security system

07:03.633 --> 07:06.867
through this fellow, an ex-NSS agent.

07:07.867 --> 07:08.967
When we infiltrate,

07:10.066 --> 07:11.467
he will guide us.

07:12.233 --> 07:13.667
How can we get in there?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.266
The waste disposal vehicle.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.900
In a place like the NSS,
the waste is also something to protect.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.300
Even a used paper cup can be used
as a tip-off,

07:23.800 --> 07:25.867
once it's in the hands of the enemy.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.066
Therefore, only a designated company
can collect their waste.

07:31.767 --> 07:32.967
We're going to use that vehicle.

07:33.066 --> 07:34.700
What is the reason
we're going into the NSS?

07:42.734 --> 07:43.734
It's me, sir.

07:44.834 --> 07:45.700
Yes.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.567
I just told him.

07:49.767 --> 07:50.667
Hear from him directly.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.500
It's me, Chul-young Park.

07:59.867 --> 08:00.867
Keep this in mind.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.500
We're not seizing the NSS

08:02.567 --> 08:05.166
in order to kill your revenge target,
San Baek.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.033
As long as you pull your weight

08:07.500 --> 08:09.166
and complete your mission
in this operation,

08:10.133 --> 08:12.300
I will give you the chance
for your revenge, as I promised.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.367
Then, what is your purpose
in seizing the NSS?

08:15.767 --> 08:17.000
I can't tell you yet.

08:17.567 --> 08:19.500
All you have to do is
to follow Do-chul Kang's orders.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.066
What I'd like to know is

08:27.767 --> 08:29.100
not why you're here.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.800
The man in Budapest at that time.

08:34.033 --> 08:34.967
This man.

08:35.033 --> 08:36.367
I want to know if he's alive or dead.

08:38.033 --> 08:39.066
Is he alive?

08:40.467 --> 08:41.367
I don't' know.

09:09.066 --> 09:10.266
If our target is the NSS,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.166
we should exclude Hyun-jun Kim.

09:16.266 --> 09:17.166
Why?

09:17.834 --> 09:22.233
They were all his colleagues and friends.
He may hesitate.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.767
If that's the case,
we should bring him along all the more.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.700
It's a good opportunity to know
whether he's working with us

09:30.934 --> 09:32.166
for real or not.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.200
We're entering South Korea.

10:05.834 --> 10:06.967
What would be the reason?

10:08.867 --> 10:10.033
It's actually better this way.

10:11.934 --> 10:13.800
It's the last chance to unlock the file

10:13.867 --> 10:15.300
of Deputy Director Baek.

10:24.633 --> 10:25.767
We're entering South Korea.

10:26.700 --> 10:27.767
Initiate the plan.

10:37.834 --> 10:38.700
Let's go.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.700
Ms. Choi, you should
take care of the delegation

11:08.867 --> 11:10.734
from the North, which will arrive today.

11:11.100 --> 11:11.934
Yes, sir.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.567
Report to me directly
about the relevant issues.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.300
Yes, I understand.

11:21.633 --> 11:22.500
Yes, it's me.

11:22.567 --> 11:23.867
We found out the terror target, sir.

11:24.233 --> 11:26.567
The East Asian Foreign Ministers
Conference will be held today,

11:26.633 --> 11:28.400
where the US Secretary of State attends.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.300
Their target is there.

11:31.367 --> 11:34.600
Move all the possible combat forces
to the site.

11:35.033 --> 11:35.967
Yes, sir.

11:37.133 --> 11:39.300
All the available SWAT
at emergency standby.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.734
-Yes.
-Yes.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.500
Pull over.

11:45.567 --> 11:46.500
Yes, sir.

11:53.967 --> 11:58.233
We found out the target of the terrorists,
who entered through Busan.

11:58.967 --> 11:59.967
Where is it, sir?

12:00.433 --> 12:02.166
East Asian Foreign Ministers Conference.

12:03.233 --> 12:05.667
The US Secretary of State will attend
the conference, too.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.900
Their target is the US Secretary of State.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.700
You go back to the agency
and support them.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.133
Yes, I understand.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.567
-Yes.
-Where are you?

13:03.633 --> 13:04.867
I'm on the way back to the agency.

13:05.066 --> 13:05.934
I was informed, sir.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.533
Get back quickly and support us.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.500
Yes, sir.

13:24.266 --> 13:25.500
We're here to pick up the waste.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.166
Now!

16:12.200 --> 16:14.066
DANGER, AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

17:01.467 --> 17:02.367
It's done.

17:02.433 --> 17:03.300
Good job.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.700
Everybody, come to the meeting point.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.567
Yes, I understand.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.867
Come on, why aren't they coming in?

17:26.233 --> 17:28.200
-I'll go and check.
-Wait.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.400
Here, they're coming in.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.233
Hello, sirs.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.867
We've never seen you before.

17:46.567 --> 17:47.900
We're new.

17:49.467 --> 17:52.000
We've never heard of such a thing.

17:53.667 --> 17:54.633
Wait for a second.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.233
Huh?

17:59.300 --> 18:00.633
Why isn't this working?

18:00.900 --> 18:01.767
Isn't it...

18:05.533 --> 18:07.734
Send me the list of the VIPs
attending today's event.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.700
Okay, I'll send it right away.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.867
The only way to enter the NSS
is the elevator.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.300
But that's impossible.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.700
I know.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.567
You have to go
through the biometric screening.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.266
We

18:34.867 --> 18:36.433
don't take the elevator.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.166
There's no other way.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.133
You'll have to find the way.

18:47.266 --> 18:48.266
Show him.

19:12.900 --> 19:13.800
Follow me.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.066
Is it here?

20:10.166 --> 20:11.066
What's this?

20:11.967 --> 20:12.867
What's going on?

20:12.967 --> 20:14.433
A fire alarm went off near the entrance.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.633
Where is this coming from?

20:21.900 --> 20:23.066
Find out which sector it is!

20:23.834 --> 20:25.066
There! Check over there!

20:25.133 --> 20:26.033
He's going that way.

20:30.667 --> 20:31.600
All clear.

20:32.567 --> 20:33.467
All clear.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.700
Install the motion detectors.

20:38.266 --> 20:39.166
Turn off the alarm.

20:52.567 --> 20:53.400
What is that?

20:57.433 --> 20:58.333
Damn it.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.600
Ring the emergency alarm
and report it to the control room!

21:00.667 --> 21:01.567
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

21:01.734 --> 21:03.367
Cut off the communication
with the outside.

21:08.867 --> 21:09.767
Control room.

21:10.967 --> 21:11.867
Control room!

21:11.967 --> 21:13.300
I can't get through the control room.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.200
The alarm is not working, either.

21:18.467 --> 21:19.667
The alarm has been deactivated.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.667
Something's wrong.

21:26.066 --> 21:27.633
Communication with the outside is cut off.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.200
Cellphones are not working, either.

21:38.967 --> 21:40.967
The transfer has been stopped.
Please send it again.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.633
Bring up all the video surveillance
on the main screen.

22:52.433 --> 22:53.500
What's happening?

23:14.133 --> 23:15.567
Hey! Hey! Are you okay?

24:09.867 --> 24:10.767
Damn.

25:29.166 --> 25:31.166
RESTRICTED AREA

26:32.700 --> 26:33.734
Hurry up.

27:06.033 --> 27:07.200
What are you doing? Get out now.

27:07.266 --> 27:08.734
We can't just leave the server like this.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.934
We have no time. Hurry.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.467
Damn... Please...

27:48.300 --> 27:49.533
If all of you follow our orders,

27:50.400 --> 27:51.333
we won't kill you.

28:40.767 --> 28:41.700
Respond.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.934
Control room.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.333
Respond, control room!

28:44.834 --> 28:45.700
Respond!

28:45.767 --> 28:46.767
-It's not working?
-No.

28:48.734 --> 28:50.066
Control room, control room, respond.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.433
Control room.

28:53.667 --> 28:56.066
It can be a temporary communication error,
so keep trying.

28:56.133 --> 28:57.000
Yes, sir.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.066
Control room, respond.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.133
Control room, respond.

29:21.133 --> 29:22.133
It's the President.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.367
It's San Baek.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.667
I heard that the terrorists are targeting

29:28.200 --> 29:29.934
the Foreign Ministers Conference.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.200
Wouldn't it be better
to cancel the conference now?

29:33.834 --> 29:34.934
Please don't worry too much.

29:35.867 --> 29:38.867
The entire NSS Counter-terrorism Division
has been deployed.

29:39.533 --> 29:41.367
If you call off the conference now,

29:42.033 --> 29:43.967
it will create great external confusion

29:44.533 --> 29:47.867
and adversely affect the summit as well.

29:48.734 --> 29:50.100
Then, I'll trust Director Baek

29:50.734 --> 29:52.500
and proceed with the conference
as scheduled.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.133
How about the guests from the North?

29:55.633 --> 29:57.967
Ah, they're arriving right now.

29:58.467 --> 30:00.300
GATEWAY TO REUNIFICATION

30:04.433 --> 30:06.467
The delegation from the North arrived.

30:07.133 --> 30:07.967
Well...

30:08.166 --> 30:10.266
What should we do
about the Foreign Ministers Conference?

30:10.767 --> 30:12.266
Carry it out as planned.

30:13.667 --> 30:14.500
Yes, sir.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.266
Thank you for your trouble coming here.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.233
The President told me
that I should take special care of you.

30:39.967 --> 30:40.900
Thank you.

30:44.433 --> 30:47.767
He's from our government agency
who'll work with your delegation.

30:52.934 --> 30:53.867
Welcome.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.166
Nice to meet you.

31:05.166 --> 31:06.400
I think I need to inspect that.

31:12.467 --> 31:13.433
Let him pass.

31:56.033 --> 31:56.900
Get your heads down!

32:00.133 --> 32:01.100
Come over here.

32:02.867 --> 32:04.400
There could be remaining agents.

32:18.867 --> 32:21.266
Search through the whole building
and lock them up.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.333
Follow me.

33:33.867 --> 33:34.767
What are you doing?

33:37.467 --> 33:38.500
Stay in your position.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.266
You little rats, move quickly!

34:11.233 --> 34:13.567
-Is this all?
-So far, yes.

34:13.633 --> 34:14.867
We're still searching.

34:16.667 --> 34:17.600
If you find more,

34:18.266 --> 34:19.533
contact me first.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.033
-Why?
-Just do as I tell you to do.

35:09.066 --> 35:11.100
Hyun-jun Kim,
it was a necessary procedure

35:12.033 --> 35:13.133
to do some profiling on you.

35:13.834 --> 35:14.867
You'd better start acting.

35:15.066 --> 35:16.100
I'll become your manager.

35:16.667 --> 35:17.800
We'll earn a lot of money.

35:19.967 --> 35:20.900
Depending on my mission,

35:21.633 --> 35:22.934
I sometimes become an actress.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.100
The file...

36:02.166 --> 36:03.333
When are you going to open it?

36:08.066 --> 36:10.567
To access San Baek's storage
in the classified information archive,

36:10.734 --> 36:11.800
at the basement level three,

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
I need his fingerprints.

36:14.066 --> 36:16.133
I'll try to obtain his fingerprints first.

36:38.867 --> 36:40.200
TEAM LEADER SEUNG-HEE CHOI

37:14.800 --> 37:15.700
These guys, seriously.

37:15.767 --> 37:16.667
What's the matter?

37:17.133 --> 37:18.633
The server shut down while I was working.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.367
Somebody put up a trap.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.166
Who was it?

37:27.467 --> 37:28.367
It's you, right?

37:29.367 --> 37:30.600
You were doing something earlier.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.200
Open the server.

37:46.333 --> 37:47.200
Open it!

37:50.333 --> 37:52.100
The server security protocol
has been activated.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.066
Without the authorization code,

37:55.100 --> 37:56.000
you can't unlock it.

37:59.667 --> 38:00.500
Then...

38:01.200 --> 38:02.200
Tell me the passcode.

38:04.867 --> 38:05.700
We don't know.

38:06.767 --> 38:09.166
None of us are ranked
high enough to clear it.

38:47.467 --> 38:48.300
What is it?

38:49.433 --> 38:50.333
She's not lying.

38:50.767 --> 38:52.467
Nobody knows
the authorization code among them.

38:52.633 --> 38:53.533
What should I do?

38:54.400 --> 38:55.467
Without restoring the server,

38:55.533 --> 38:57.367
we can't open the storage
inside the R&D room.

38:57.734 --> 38:58.600
The R&D room?

38:59.166 --> 39:01.266
Can you restore the server
without the passcode?

39:01.967 --> 39:02.867
I can give it a try,

39:02.934 --> 39:04.066
but it will take some time.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.266
How long?

39:05.333 --> 39:06.233
About 30 minutes.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.367
No!

39:08.567 --> 39:09.467
That's too late.

39:44.300 --> 39:45.166
What did you do?

39:47.100 --> 39:49.133
Now nobody can enter or leave here
for one hour.

39:49.633 --> 39:50.967
I closed off the whole NSS building.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.467
I bought time for you, so get started.

40:00.000 --> 40:00.834
You may go.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.166
It's about time that you tell me

40:07.834 --> 40:09.066
why we came to the NSS.

40:09.967 --> 40:11.867
What are you trying to take
from the R&D room?

40:15.934 --> 40:17.367
Put aside your useless curiosity

40:18.333 --> 40:19.500
and you just do your own job.

41:50.066 --> 41:51.066
Gosh... Please.

41:59.667 --> 42:00.567
How is it going?

42:00.734 --> 42:01.900
We haven't connected yet.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.800
Check if there are jamming signals.

42:06.967 --> 42:07.867
Yes, sir.

42:10.533 --> 42:11.467
It's Sa-woo Jin.

42:11.533 --> 42:12.467
It's me.

42:13.033 --> 42:14.533
The NSS is under attack now.

42:17.567 --> 42:18.867
Ma'am, are you okay?

42:34.767 --> 42:35.600
Captain!

42:37.400 --> 42:38.600
What's it? Are you finished?

42:38.667 --> 42:39.734
It's not that.

42:39.967 --> 42:41.533
Somebody is communicating
with the outside.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.433
What?

42:42.500 --> 42:43.767
Didn't you disable everything?

42:43.867 --> 42:45.467
I did except for our team's cellphones.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.066
Then...

42:47.834 --> 42:49.500
Someone among us--

42:49.567 --> 42:50.500
No.

42:50.567 --> 42:52.567
I think someone restored
an unused wired line.

42:53.166 --> 42:54.066
Where is it?

42:54.133 --> 42:55.467
In the west sector, one level down.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.033
Both of you, go and check.

43:00.066 --> 43:00.900
Disable it.

43:04.734 --> 43:05.867
The situation is not good here.

43:06.767 --> 43:07.834
Please hurry--

43:08.767 --> 43:10.133
Ma'am? Ma'am!

43:10.767 --> 43:11.767
Hello?

43:11.834 --> 43:12.800
TK2!

43:45.300 --> 43:46.133
Sir.

43:46.767 --> 43:47.867
It's a Code Black.

43:48.900 --> 43:50.333
Our agency is in the hands of the enemy.

43:53.567 --> 43:55.834
We're closer to the agency.
We'll be there.

43:56.233 --> 43:58.266
Sir, please take care
of the situation there.

44:02.800 --> 44:03.700
It's a Code Black.

44:03.834 --> 44:05.033
We're going back to the agency.

44:05.467 --> 44:06.433
Yes, sir.

44:14.633 --> 44:15.867
Listen, everyone in the vehicles.

44:16.200 --> 44:18.433
Code Black situation has occurred
just now.

44:19.166 --> 44:20.433
Vehicle Two, go back to the agency

44:20.500 --> 44:22.233
and follow the orders from Sa-woo Jin.

44:22.300 --> 44:23.166
Over.

44:32.166 --> 44:33.166
Even if the server is down,

44:33.266 --> 44:35.266
the interior video surveillance
isn't dead, right?

44:35.333 --> 44:36.467
Since it's a separate system,

44:36.900 --> 44:38.633
it's possible. Why?

44:40.266 --> 44:41.300
We lost the one who called.

44:41.934 --> 44:42.834
We need to find him.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.166
Did Captain give you permission?

44:45.233 --> 44:47.166
Why do I need his permission
for something obvious?

44:47.667 --> 44:49.400
We have no time. Please hurry.

45:36.600 --> 45:37.600
DANGER: FLAMMABLE

45:57.400 --> 45:58.367
Damn it!

46:01.567 --> 46:02.400
How did it go?

46:03.600 --> 46:04.467
I'm still...

46:04.700 --> 46:05.633
You can't?

46:05.700 --> 46:06.567
Yes.

46:06.633 --> 46:07.667
I can do it. I will.

46:08.467 --> 46:09.767
How long do you think it will take?

46:11.600 --> 46:12.467
One hour?

46:12.633 --> 46:13.834
No, that's too late.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.967
If someone communicated with the outside,

46:17.100 --> 46:19.000
their backup will be arriving soon.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.066
Pack your tools and follow me.

46:37.433 --> 46:38.500
To the control room, now.

46:50.734 --> 46:52.867
We'll have to give up on
opening the safe from here.

46:53.233 --> 46:54.266
Then, what should we do?

46:55.734 --> 46:57.333
We'll go and open it directly.

46:57.934 --> 46:59.266
The security system will be tough.

46:59.667 --> 47:00.633
It's dangerous.

47:02.066 --> 47:02.934
Follow me.

47:09.333 --> 47:10.600
You two, guard this spot.

47:17.266 --> 47:19.200
Now is the chance.
Please look out for me here.

48:09.567 --> 48:10.500
Take cover!

50:27.333 --> 50:29.266
Sir, sir!

50:30.333 --> 50:31.367
Sir, are you okay?

50:31.767 --> 50:32.667
-Ouch...
-Sir!

50:34.734 --> 50:37.033
What, what's going on here, huh?

50:37.100 --> 50:39.266
I requested for a rescue,
so the backup will arrive soon.

50:39.600 --> 50:40.633
Stay here until then.

50:41.333 --> 50:42.233
No, what...

50:42.300 --> 50:44.633
Where are you going, huh?

50:44.900 --> 50:47.166
Stay here with me until the backup comes.

50:47.367 --> 50:48.800
Hide here until then.

51:31.934 --> 51:33.100
It might be Hyun-jun.

51:35.700 --> 51:36.934
Did you just say Hyun-jun?

52:19.066 --> 52:19.934
Over there.

52:26.533 --> 52:27.367
Did you try?

52:29.333 --> 52:30.233
I'm going now.

52:31.100 --> 52:32.033
Let's go together.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.533
Stay here.

52:37.133 --> 52:38.367
I'll tune in to channel two.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.367
Contact me if anything happens.

53:08.100 --> 53:08.934
It's done.

53:12.166 --> 53:13.000
WARNING

53:13.166 --> 53:14.000
Wait!

53:19.233 --> 53:20.066
Damn it.

53:20.166 --> 53:22.233
This is why I should've restored
the control room server.

53:25.867 --> 53:27.133
Exactly what's in there?

53:28.533 --> 53:29.600
Continue.

54:22.734 --> 54:23.667
It's done.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.734
Are you sure?

54:29.967 --> 54:30.934
Probably.

55:12.166 --> 55:13.033
All done.

55:13.567 --> 55:14.433
Take this.

56:08.567 --> 56:09.433
What's going on?

56:20.467 --> 56:22.233
The emergency security system
has been activated,

56:22.300 --> 56:23.500
shutting down all the doors.

56:23.567 --> 56:25.200
-Disable the system.
-Yes, sir.

56:53.467 --> 56:54.500
Request for backup.

56:54.567 --> 56:55.467
What is it?

56:55.533 --> 56:57.066
I found the one who called to the outside.

56:57.133 --> 56:58.066
It's basement level three.

56:58.767 --> 57:00.166
I'm pursuing him with A1.

58:58.900 --> 58:59.867
It's a double shut-down,

58:59.967 --> 59:01.200
so we can't disable it from here.

59:03.633 --> 59:05.066
We need to get in there by any means.

59:06.166 --> 59:07.467
Unless we blow up the wall,

59:07.533 --> 59:08.433
it's impossible.

59:09.266 --> 59:10.100
Blow it up.

59:11.233 --> 59:12.667
The backup will be arriving soon.

59:13.000 --> 59:13.834
Shouldn't we wait?

59:13.900 --> 59:14.934
We have no time. Blow it up!

59:15.433 --> 59:17.066
It's too reckless to enter
when we don't know

59:17.266 --> 59:18.200
what's going on inside.

59:23.100 --> 59:24.100
Blow it up, right now.

59:26.333 --> 59:27.467
Yes, I got it.

59:55.066 --> 59:56.066
Don't move!

1:00:01.333 --> 1:00:02.233
Turn around.

1:00:16.433 --> 1:00:17.367
Drop your gun.

1:00:19.367 --> 1:00:20.266
Drop your gun!

1:00:50.333 --> 1:00:51.233
Don't move.

1:00:51.667 --> 1:00:52.734
Drop your gun!

1:01:04.767 --> 1:01:05.867
Drop your gun now!

1:02:12.667 --> 1:02:14.633
NEXT EPISODE

1:02:14.934 --> 1:02:16.300
What the heck did you do to Seung-hee?

1:02:16.734 --> 1:02:18.400
Nobody will take your word, Hyun-jun.

1:02:19.100 --> 1:02:21.667
Think about why you've come
all the way here.

1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:25.767
-What about Ms. Choi?
-There's no one but us.

1:02:27.567 --> 1:02:28.433
That man...

1:02:29.967 --> 1:02:30.800
might be Hyun-jun.

1:02:31.266 --> 1:02:32.734
This is the file in San Baek's archive.

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:35.033
It contains everything.

1:02:36.367 --> 1:02:39.000
There were documents
about your parents, Hyun-jun.

1:02:41.367 --> 1:02:44.300
There's something
that I didn't mention in the report.

1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:47.066
Can't you tell me
what you took from the NSS?

1:02:48.467 --> 1:02:49.567
Right in the middle of Seoul,

1:02:50.333 --> 1:02:52.300
something that you've never expected
will occur.
