00:16.440 --> 00:18.060

00:28.280 --> 00:30.300
Whoa, Muscle Man,
are you crying?

00:30.400 --> 00:32.140
Yes, I'm crying.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.860
I'm feeling deep emotions and
they're expressing themselves

00:34.960 --> 00:36.500
physically on my face.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.460
It's part of what makes me
a man.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.820
Ugh! Are you guys watching
"Lazer Hunters"?

00:40.920 --> 00:43.140
Why is everybody at the station
addicted to it?

00:43.240 --> 00:44.980
Yeah, it's so cheesy.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.460
Oh, get over yourselves.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.560
This show
is a cultural phenomenon.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.220
It's ending next week.
Give it a chance.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.900
Mm.
I don't know.

Okay.

a shot.

( All crying )

01:08.560 --> 01:10.380
Ooh!
( Chuckles, shivers )

01:10.480 --> 01:11.780
That was really good.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.920
Dude, we gotta catch up
before the finale next week.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.300
How many seasons
are there?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.380
Eight.
If you start watching now,

01:17.480 --> 01:19.620
you just barely
have enough time to catch up.

01:19.720 --> 01:23.180
But only if you use
this mayonnaise jar as a toilet.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.280
Thanks.
Dude, weren't we
supposed to do something

01:25.200 --> 01:27.200
for Benson
before we walked in here?

01:26.840 --> 01:29.060
Uh...
vacuum the floors?

01:29.160 --> 01:31.160
But we could put that off
till later.

probably right.

Bros, you did it!

01:48.240 --> 01:51.180
You watched 168 hours
of "Lazer Hunters."

01:51.280 --> 01:53.660
And you're just in time
for the finale.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.760
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
So many questions!

01:55.280 --> 01:57.560
Like, what was the deal with
the space lizard cold open?

01:57.640 --> 01:59.600
Was Brick's cousin's salsa
in the safety deposit box?

01:59.680 --> 02:01.680
Why was there a squid
in the percolator?!

02:01.360 --> 02:03.360
Who made the holotape
that tipped off the colonel?!

02:02.920 --> 02:04.500
Not so dumb anymore,
is it?

02:04.600 --> 02:05.780
And now, finally,

02:05.880 --> 02:08.380
the finale will answer
all our questions!

Mordecai and Rigby.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.900
Oh, hey, Benson.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.960
We were just about to watch
the "Lazer Hunters" finale.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.540
No, you're not,
because you and Mordecai

02:20.640 --> 02:23.860
are going to go vacuum the
floors in the house right now!

02:23.960 --> 02:26.340
Just like I told you to
a week ago!

02:26.440 --> 02:27.660
Aw, Benson.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.980
Can't we just
vacuum after?
Now.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.640
The house is all the way on
the other side of the station!
Don't care.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.140
The finale will be over
by the time we get back!
Go.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.440
How are we gonna get back here
without hearing spoilers?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.340
Go vacuum the house!

02:39.440 --> 02:40.540
Ugh!
Ugh!

Whoa, tough break,
guys.

so you can watch it later?

Give me the tape.

we get this done,

that tape.

Oh, no! "Lazer Hunters"
is ending right now, dude!

03:08.680 --> 03:10.020
Dude, don't panic.

Everything you need
to avoid spoilers.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.620
Two years ago,
the ending

03:33.720 --> 03:35.800
of the Carter and Briggs movie
was spoiled for us,

03:35.880 --> 03:37.340
and what did we vow,
Rigby?

03:37.440 --> 03:39.460
That it would never happen
again.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.300
That it would never happen
again.

Okay, step one ââ
Go off the grid.

turned them off!

What's step two?

Okay, step three ââ

03:56.160 --> 03:58.620
Get to the tape!
What?!

03:58.720 --> 04:01.420
We have to go back
to the barracks for the tape!
Oh, yeah.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.520
And remember ââ everybody
and their brother

04:03.280 --> 04:05.280
is gonna be
talking about this,

04:04.560 --> 04:07.020

Guys?

( Coughs )

04:15.240 --> 04:16.580
Where are they?

04:16.680 --> 04:18.860
I don't know the answer
to that question, bro.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.300
But I can tell you

04:20.400 --> 04:22.540
that these floors
have not been vacuumed.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.100
I see.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.340
How does it end?
What?

04:26.440 --> 04:29.300
"Lazer Hunters."
I'm gonna ruin it for them.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.340
But ââ
How...

04:51.320 --> 04:53.300
When the beam kills...
How about that...

04:53.400 --> 04:56.140
Never saw that coming
in a million years!
( Music fades )

04:56.240 --> 04:58.240
The batteries
must be dead!

Hah!

05:06.840 --> 05:08.840
Both: HmâHmâHmâHm!

05:12.520 --> 05:15.460
It's not the texture so much,
it's the smell.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.140
Oh, hey, Benson.
What are you doing here?

05:18.240 --> 05:19.780
I'm waiting here
so I can spoil

05:19.880 --> 05:21.960
the "Lazer Hunters" finale
for Mordecai and Rigby.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.700
Why do you want
to spoil it?

05:23.800 --> 05:25.620
It's gonna
totally ruin their day.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.420
Oh, booâhooâhoo!

05:27.520 --> 05:28.980
You know my day
was ruined

05:29.080 --> 05:31.860
when Rawls got on my case
about getting the dome in shape.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.260
Vacuuming the house
was the last step!

05:35.360 --> 05:37.580
Mordecai and Rigby
don't take anything seriously.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.860
I mean, we're supposed to take
the dome out on our own soon!

05:40.960 --> 05:43.420
Spoiler alert for our mission ââ
we fail out there!

05:43.520 --> 05:46.940
We fail spectacular...ly?

05:51.920 --> 05:52.980
Fine!

05:53.080 --> 05:55.500
I'm glad we're
in the air ducts!

05:55.600 --> 05:58.140
The acoustics in here
are perfect for spoilers!

No!

06:15.800 --> 06:17.800
( Screaming continues )

06:20.600 --> 06:22.100
Nothing but net.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.620
You catch that finale,
Sally?

06:23.720 --> 06:26.500
I couldn't believe Zolthar's
bones were in the ââ

06:32.840 --> 06:34.820
( Grunts )

06:34.920 --> 06:37.820
What now?!
"In case of emergency,
get to a safe room!"

06:37.920 --> 06:40.120
If we loop back to the barracks,
we can lock Benson out!

06:42.800 --> 06:44.780
( Panting )

06:44.880 --> 06:47.280
( Growls )

06:47.800 --> 06:49.260

06:49.360 --> 06:51.500
Hey! ( Grunts )

06:51.600 --> 06:53.600
Whoa! ( Groans )

06:54.960 --> 06:56.960
Sorry!
We're just borrowing them!

06:57.680 --> 07:00.060
Excuse me.
Have you seen two idiots?

07:00.160 --> 07:02.940
It's very important that I
spoil "Lazer Hunters" for them.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.020
( Whistles ) Spoilers, huh?
That's cold.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.940
You know, I used to
teach quantum physics.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.460
Then my brotherâinâlaw

07:08.560 --> 07:11.380
spoiled the "Egg Baby Bonanza"
finale for me.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.980
I tell you,
I fell into a pit of despair.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.900
Quit my job,
lost my house,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.460
rolled a big rock down a hill
onto my brotherâinâlaw.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.940
Just made
some bad choices.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.180
Now I sweep up trash for scraps
like a gutter urchin.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.540
Because of those spoilers,
I have nothing.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.300
That's perfect!
So have you seen them?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.400
Yeah,
right over there.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.140
Hey! Hey!
I live in that!

07:35.240 --> 07:37.440
( Indistinct shouting )

07:41.040 --> 07:41.900
( Gasps )

07:42.000 --> 07:43.100
Get ready.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.620
You're gonna to hear
this spoiler.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.720
( Inhales deeply )
( Horn honking )

07:46.880 --> 07:48.880
Huh?

07:49.280 --> 07:51.280
<i>And now, for the losers</i>

08:08.320 --> 08:09.980
Get ready.

08:10.080 --> 08:10.780
Jump!

08:10.880 --> 08:11.980
Whoa!

08:12.080 --> 08:13.060
Oh!

08:13.160 --> 08:15.380
I think
I'm really hurt.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.260
No time!

Locking barracks!

08:19.400 --> 08:21.780
( Panting )

08:21.880 --> 08:23.300
We're safe!
Let's do this!

08:23.400 --> 08:24.660
Yes! Finally!

08:24.760 --> 08:28.780
Benson: I just wanted
the carpets vacuumed.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.880
( Both gasp )

08:34.240 --> 08:36.020
Pack it up, guys.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.780
You failed.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.540
Hey, buddy.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.260
Let's not do
anything rash.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.020
All those hours
spent planning and planning

08:46.120 --> 08:48.140
and running away from me.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.180
All that time
and energy wasted

08:51.280 --> 08:54.180
on Operation: Hear No Evil.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.140
Now I'm gonna
spoil "Lazer Hunters"

08:57.240 --> 08:59.140
once and for all.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.780
La la la la!
No.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.620
Benson's not gonna do that
to us.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.500
( Laughs )
And why is that?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.260
'Cause you don't know
the last phase

09:07.360 --> 09:09.020
of Operation:
Hear No Evil.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.300
Oh, give it up.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.020
You and I both know

09:12.120 --> 09:15.740
there's nothing in that backpack
that's gonna change my mind.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.300
Not even...

09:17.400 --> 09:19.140
the finale
of "Dr. Whiskers, M.D."?!

09:19.240 --> 09:20.900
( Gasps )
Okay, wait.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.940
Uh, let's not do anything
we'd regret.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.100
Dude, what?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.700
Oh, just
Benson's favorite show.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.860
He was bingeâwatching it right
before we left Earth, but...

09:29.960 --> 09:31.380
I never got to see
the finale.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.700
Wait, so
what's on the tape?

09:32.800 --> 09:35.020
The last 10 seconds
of that finale ââ

09:35.120 --> 09:37.060
Dr. Whiskers' big reveal!

09:37.160 --> 09:38.300
Mordecai.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.820
It's up to you,
Benson.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.920
Let us watch the "Lazer Hunters"
finale in peace,

09:41.800 --> 09:43.900
or we spoil
your cat show.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.140
You're bluffing.

09:46.240 --> 09:49.820
<i>And so, after months of</i>
<i>unbelievable twists and turns,</i>

09:49.920 --> 09:52.300
<i>I will finally reveal</i>
<i>whose paws</i>

09:52.400 --> 09:55.100
<i>were behind the murders</i>
<i>of the Calico Crew!</i>

09:55.200 --> 09:56.980
No! Stop it!
Stop!

09:57.080 --> 09:58.380
( Panting )

09:58.480 --> 09:59.220
Truce?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.860
Truce.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.300
You can vacuum the floors
after you watch the finale.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
Both: Whoooooa!

10:07.760 --> 10:08.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:08.880 --> 10:10.140
( <i>Theme music plays)</i>

10:10.240 --> 10:11.940
We did it, dude!
It's happening!

10:12.040 --> 10:13.820
( Chuckles )
The "Lazer Hunters" finale!

10:13.920 --> 10:16.180
You get to the part
where LeFever dies yet?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.380
Ugh!
Ugh!

10:17.480 --> 10:19.480
Dude, I told you
to lock the door!

10:18.720 --> 10:19.620
( Laughs )

10:19.720 --> 10:21.540
( Chuckles ) Whoops.
My bad.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.860
Seriously, though,
that ending's almost as good

10:23.960 --> 10:25.780
as the end of
"Dr. Whiskers, M.D."

10:25.880 --> 10:27.860
Can you believe
Fuzzmeister Fuzzball

10:27.960 --> 10:29.100
killed the Calico Crew?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.580
( Chuckles )

10:30.680 --> 10:32.540
Well, bye.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.020
