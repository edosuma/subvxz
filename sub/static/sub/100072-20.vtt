Chris, I can't believe
you're helping the principal

00:38.872 --> 00:40.656
with morning announcements today.

00:40.657 --> 00:43.117
And I can't believe
I forgot to wear pants.

00:43.118 --> 00:45.119
- Meg, give him your pants.
- Mom!

00:45.120 --> 00:47.038
Meg, it's a big day for your brother.

00:47.039 --> 00:48.923
Fine.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.424
It's so cool.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.044
You're going to be like
one of those DJs on SiriusXM,

00:53.045 --> 00:55.680
where it's all national
so nothing's local anymore.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.775
Okay, Chris, while you make
these announcements,

01:15.776 --> 01:17.910
I'm going to be massaging
your shoulders,

01:17.911 --> 01:20.830
just so I can say in court
that I do it to everyone.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.658
And if you want to liven things
up, you can start out by saying,

01:23.659 --> 01:25.576
"Good morning, Vietnam!"

01:25.577 --> 01:26.877
- What?
- You know,

01:26.878 --> 01:28.629
from the movie starring Robin Williams.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.748
- Who?
- It was set in the Vietnam War.

01:30.749 --> 01:32.967
- Where?
- He was nominated for an Oscar.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.469
- Why?
- But, sadly, he recently died.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.471
- How?
- He choked himself off.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.091
That's the first thing I understood.

01:40.092 --> 01:41.475
Go ahead.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.636
Okay. "God..."

01:43.637 --> 01:45.972
- Good.
- "Good movement..."

01:45.973 --> 01:48.774
- Morning.
- "Morning, Engelbert."

01:48.775 --> 01:50.643
- Everyone.
- "Everyone.

The stagnant cancer muting..."

01:52.946 --> 01:54.697
The student council meeting.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.115
You know what? You're done. Good job.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.701
Great job, Chris.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.988

02:01.989 --> 02:03.831

02:12.007 --> 02:14.342
<i>And that's how you do an announcement.</i>

02:14.343 --> 02:16.010
<i>Not like that tub of lard Griffin.</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:17.795
<i>Ugh, I feel like I gained 20 pounds</i>

Gordo.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.732
<i>That kid was</i> mucho gordo.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.484
I think you mean "muy gordo."

<i>That's enough, Lawnmower Guy.</i>

02:43.989 --> 02:46.874

02:55.417 --> 02:57.418
- Hey, Stewie, where's the...
- Shh!

02:57.419 --> 02:59.170
I'm at the opera, Brian.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.718
This part always speaks to me.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.054
I can't stand to hear Italians talk

03:08.055 --> 03:10.356
but, man, get 'em singing.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.275
Stewie, how can you afford
an entire opera in your room?

03:13.276 --> 03:15.061
Oh, boy, Brian's upset

03:15.062 --> 03:16.862
because someone has something
he doesn't.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.531
You know what I'm getting you
for your birthday?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.616
The ability to be happy
for other people.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.909
You're not answering my question.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.994
Brian, I'd love to stay and talk,

03:23.995 --> 03:26.030
but Bugs Bunny is about to
make this tenor

03:26.031 --> 03:28.532

than anyone should.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.924

<i>Morning,

03:49.346 --> 03:51.764
<i>We're having trouble
supporting the defendant's claim.</i>

03:51.765 --> 03:53.399
Is this show a drama or a comedy?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.934
I don't know, let's look it up.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.185
<i>Then you need to dig into those files...</i>

03:56.186 --> 03:58.738
- Eight seasons?!
- "Filmed in Toronto."

03:58.739 --> 04:00.740
There's a Japanese version?!

04:00.741 --> 04:02.950
"Other shows filmed in Toronto."

04:02.951 --> 04:05.119
<i>Handmaid's Tale, Shadowhunters...</i>

<i>Guys, please,</i>

04:08.707 --> 04:10.241
<i>people worked really hard on this.</i>

04:13.962 --> 04:15.746
It's Chris, you idiot.

04:15.747 --> 04:16.997
Mary, what happened?

04:16.998 --> 04:18.916
Principal Shepherd fat-shamed Chris

04:18.916 --> 04:20.050
in front of the whole school.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.878
- Oh, no!
- Just stay the course, Lois.

04:22.879 --> 04:25.765
That "fat" is going to win him
Biggest Boy at the state fair.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.684
- Peter, this is very serious.
- So is Biggest Boy.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.887
School should be a safe place
where they get shot sometimes.

04:31.888 --> 04:34.106
They should not be insulted!

04:34.107 --> 04:35.809
Peter, are you even listening to me?

04:52.584 --> 04:55.286
So we're all decided,
our last high school play

04:55.287 --> 04:57.087
was about as gay as we wanna go.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.582
Let's try to top out
at that level of gay.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.050
If there's nothing else...

05:01.051 --> 05:03.969
There's still the agenda item of
you fat-shaming Chris Griffin.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.971
I think we can table that,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.140
as long as it's a pretty strong table.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.559
Excuse me, I'm sorry,

05:10.560 --> 05:12.678
but fat-shaming is not okay!

05:12.679 --> 05:15.481
This is the year 2020
and nothing is okay.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.349
This is the year of instant outrage.

05:17.350 --> 05:20.477
- What?!
- This is my son we're talking about.

05:20.478 --> 05:23.614
Sure, more than once I've caught
him eating Crisco with a spoon,

05:23.615 --> 05:25.399
but I can't watch everything he eats.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.117
That's all I'd be doing!

05:27.118 --> 05:30.154
And deep down, he's just like
everyone else...

05:30.155 --> 05:33.407
all together in one big pair of pants.

05:33.408 --> 05:36.043
His-his sister Meg's pants.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.161
Oh! Pow!

05:37.162 --> 05:39.463
Lois, did you try this stuff
out of town?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.756
- It's killing!
- Yeah.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.174
I'm funny.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.044
In any case, Principal Shepherd
needs to be held accountable

05:45.045 --> 05:47.046
for fat-shaming my son.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.715
No matter how fat or shameful he may be.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.884
If your son had been shot,
all I could offer

05:51.885 --> 05:53.719
is thoughts and prayers, but this calls

05:53.720 --> 05:55.521
for a far stronger response.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.640
Shepherd, you're fired.

05:57.641 --> 05:59.608
Oh, yeah? Well, now that I'm fired,

05:59.609 --> 06:02.570
I can finally tell you all
how I really feel about you!

06:02.571 --> 06:04.655
You're like family to me.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.074
Alexa? Play the sad song from <i> Stripes.</i>

06:18.253 --> 06:20.922
- Hey!
- We're still in here!

06:24.050 --> 06:26.085
Uh, excuse me. I saw a commercial

06:26.086 --> 06:28.888
in which a dog had a very shiny coat.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.590
The dog was, uh, jumping over a fence.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.726
Maybe on a farm or something?

06:33.727 --> 06:35.477
Again, his coat was very shiny.

06:35.478 --> 06:39.732
Yeah, I, um, hate this job?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.893
So, I don't know?

06:42.894 --> 06:44.728
Oh, my gosh, wow!

06:44.729 --> 06:46.814
- This is so exciting!
- Excuse me?

06:46.815 --> 06:48.115
It's really you.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.034
We recognize you from your book!

06:50.035 --> 06:53.704
Ah, you've read <i>
Faster Than the Speed of Love.</i>

06:53.705 --> 06:54.989
Be careful with that thing.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.408
It might accidentally change your life.

06:57.409 --> 06:58.542
Oh, (BLEEP)!

06:58.543 --> 07:01.496
I don't know that book.
I'm talking about this one.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.207
<i>Flunky The Dumb White Dog?</i>

07:05.208 --> 07:07.510
"By Griffin Stewart"?

07:13.383 --> 07:15.718
My catchphrase is "Herf derf"?

07:15.719 --> 07:19.013
Hey, do you know where I could
find any books about, um...

07:19.014 --> 07:21.316
"the pan-crease"?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.154
Thanks for taking me
to the movies, Peter.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.739
Aw, sure, Lois.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.240
You know, when you said "Miles Teller,"

07:30.241 --> 07:31.742
I was like, "Eh."

07:31.743 --> 07:32.943
But then once you get here,

07:32.944 --> 07:34.578
you realize you can sit anywhere.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.779
Hello, Griffins.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.781
Principal Shepherd?

07:37.782 --> 07:40.793
That's right.
And it's just "Firstname Shepherd"

07:40.794 --> 07:42.962
now that you've had me fired
and I have no income.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.797
And now I'm living in my car,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.499
just panhandling outside
Miles Teller movies,

07:47.500 --> 07:50.135
which is pretty slim pickings,
obviously.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.389
Lois, can I talk to you
one step over this way,

07:53.390 --> 07:56.342
yet magically out of earshot from him?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.927
We can't let this stand.
We have to do something for him.

07:58.928 --> 08:01.388
What are we supposed to do?
He brought this on himself.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.980
All right, Peter, he can live with us

08:09.981 --> 08:11.532
until he gets back on his feet.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.784
You made a full and convincing case.

08:13.785 --> 08:14.786
Ya...

08:15.820 --> 08:17.488
...ay, you can live with us!

08:17.489 --> 08:18.907
Wow, that's great news.

08:22.035 --> 08:26.205
Uh, what's your, um, ferret policy?

08:26.206 --> 08:28.590
Huh, wow, Lois,
if he's asking about it, too,

08:28.591 --> 08:30.125
I guess we should finally get one.

08:30.126 --> 08:32.462
Peter, we're not getting a ferret.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.933
Also, would it make any sense
to put all the beds in one room

08:38.934 --> 08:40.977
and make one room a trampoline room?

08:40.979 --> 08:43.982
Oh, well, now that's interesting.

08:50.855 --> 08:52.489
Well, here we are.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.492
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I don't know how to thank you.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.494
Ah, don't worry about it.
Make yourself at home.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.997
The Wi-Fi is "Joe Swanson Guest."

08:59.998 --> 09:01.582
Chris? There's someone here

09:01.583 --> 09:04.001
who's got somethin' to say to you!

09:04.002 --> 09:08.172
I've never seen this man before
in my life.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.166
Principal Shepherd?!
What are you doing here?

09:11.167 --> 09:12.968
Chris, I fat-shamed you,

09:12.969 --> 09:15.637
and I believe I owe you
a weaselly political apology.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.057
So, if you took offense
to anything I said,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.676
I certainly regret that you did that.

09:20.677 --> 09:22.561
At this point,
I consider the matter closed.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.513
Thank you so much, Principal Shepherd.

09:24.514 --> 09:26.982
I know that was very difficult for you.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.901
Well, I accept your apology, Chris.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.227
Onward and upward.

09:30.228 --> 09:32.980
Now, I believe you have some
masturbating to do, young man?

09:32.981 --> 09:34.448
I already did it.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.200
- Chris...?
- I mean...

09:36.201 --> 09:38.068
I was about to.

09:38.069 --> 09:39.870
Attaboy.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.823
Oh, he's a good boy.

09:42.824 --> 09:44.208
Oh, he is.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.540
This is real 'cause
I'm making the motor noise.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.377
Hey there, Stewie.

09:55.378 --> 09:57.045
Finally cutting that grass, I see.

09:58.214 --> 10:00.215
Well, if someone had returned my mower

10:00.216 --> 10:01.884
when they said they were going to,

10:01.885 --> 10:03.552
I would've done it weeks ago.

10:03.553 --> 10:07.055
Whoa, I see the mower isn't
the only thing running hot.

10:07.056 --> 10:09.525
But speaking of, I, uh,
need to borrow a shovel.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.435
- I'm digging a hole.
- A hole?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.904
- Where are you going? China?
- That's the hope.

10:13.905 --> 10:16.990
All right, well, I'll be
checking your Instagram.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.111
Whoa, careful!

10:21.112 --> 10:23.447
That's how God makes angels.

10:23.448 --> 10:26.116
Well, I guess I know where you
got all that money!

10:26.117 --> 10:28.752
You wrote a whole children's
book series about me.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.629
And you made me look like a total idiot!

10:30.630 --> 10:32.247
Look, you got to call the publisher

10:32.248 --> 10:34.750
- and have these books recalled.
- Not a chance, Brian.

10:34.751 --> 10:37.753
All I'm doing is presenting you
honestly to the public.

10:37.754 --> 10:40.005
Just like I did to the witches in Salem.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.925
Who but a witch would not
give up her virtue to a man

10:42.926 --> 10:46.261
who brought her a luncheon
of salt pork and boiled sweets?

10:46.262 --> 10:48.981
But Your Honor,
I tried to give up my virtue.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.141
I begged him to take me then and there.

10:51.142 --> 10:54.111
Yeah, okay, okay, n-nobody
believes that tall tale.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.612
And he would have none of it.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.865
I offered him posterior intimacy.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.117
Okay, let's just...
E-everyone calm down.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.619
The court reporter will still his quill.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.655
On hands and knees I begged him.

11:04.656 --> 11:06.540
He said he had an early appointment.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.536
Witch! Witch! Press her between stones!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.174
<i>Attention, Griffins.</i>

11:15.175 --> 11:18.177
<i>Could Peter Griffin please
report to the backyard?</i>

11:18.178 --> 11:19.845
Ooh...

11:19.846 --> 11:21.514
Shut up.

11:22.966 --> 11:24.967
Peter, I'm looking
at your aptitude assessment.

11:24.968 --> 11:27.603
Uh, we think you would be
more comfortable

11:27.604 --> 11:29.980
eating in the special breakfast unit.

11:32.183 --> 11:34.184
It sounds like chaos in there.

11:34.185 --> 11:36.069
Don't worry, Miss Judy
will take care of you.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.821
She doesn't have her teaching degree,

11:37.822 --> 11:39.656
but she is abnormally strong.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.860
Why can't I just eat with my family?

11:43.861 --> 11:47.864
We're trying to get you ready
to eat with your family.

11:47.865 --> 11:49.408
Hey, you must be Miss Judy.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.659
Ow, that's my wrist!

11:50.660 --> 11:53.046
That's my wrist, Miss Judy! Ow!

11:58.167 --> 11:59.418
Attention, Griffins.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.803
Someone drew a penis on my car.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.756
- Peter, I'm looking at you.
- Couldn't have been me.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.309
I don't even know what penises
look like 'cause I'm not gay.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.053
- Never even seen one.
- You don't have a penis?

12:10.054 --> 12:12.356
I do, I just don't look at it
'cause I'm not gay.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.025
Now, if it was a vagina,
I'd say you have your man.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.060
Seen a ton of those.
Seen three of those.

12:17.061 --> 12:20.113
Whoa, whoa, whoa, three? Deets, Dad.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.282
- Okay, your mom...
- Nice.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.118
- Your sister, when she was born...
- Getting colder.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.904
And my aunt. She fell out
of the casket at her funeral

12:27.905 --> 12:29.239
and her dress came up.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.167
Did you know they pack cotton
in corpses' noses,

12:32.168 --> 12:35.587
rectums and vaginas to prevent
embalming fluid from leaking?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.123
Anyway, I gave the eulogy at the
church and I talked about it.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.591
It was all ad-libbed.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.093
Now that preacher won't even
make eye contact with me

12:41.094 --> 12:42.711
at the grocery store.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.429
I don't know why
that bothers me, but it does.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.215
What were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, your car got donged.

12:47.216 --> 12:49.218
Yeah, I did it. It was me.

12:56.517 --> 12:58.735
Okay, who do I make this out to?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.737
Actually, could you use a Sharpie?

13:00.738 --> 13:03.073
No, my-my mom says I can't use Sharpies.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.908
They're permanent.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.526
Stewart Griffin?

13:06.527 --> 13:09.997
I represent Brian Griffin,
who is suing you for defamation.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.492
That's right, I lawyered up,
you little <i> bitch.</i>

13:17.914 --> 13:19.915
Sorry I'm late, I was just...

13:19.916 --> 13:22.501
Ah, ah, ah,<i> en français,</i>
Monsieur Griffin.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.252
God.

13:24.253 --> 13:28.965
<i>Je</i> was watching <i> Je Love Lucy,</i> then <i> je...</i>

13:28.966 --> 13:31.968
was wondering why Lucy
wasn't talking so much,

13:31.969 --> 13:37.274
and then <i> je</i> realized it was just
a orange cat in a ashtray.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.775
All right, never mind that.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.611
Just join me one step over here,
yet out of earshot,

13:41.612 --> 13:43.481
so I can rap your knuckles with a ruler.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.277
Ah! That's it!

13:49.278 --> 13:50.912
I want you out of our house right now!

13:50.913 --> 13:53.949
- We are sick of you!
- What? You're kicking me out?

13:53.950 --> 13:55.667
Does everyone feel this way?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.620
<i>- Oui, absolument.</i>
- Gérard Depardieu.

13:58.621 --> 14:00.872
Well, at least someone's
been paying attention.

14:00.873 --> 14:03.125
But very well.
I'll get out of your hair.

14:03.126 --> 14:06.462
If you'll all just help me get
my things out of the basement.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.893
Wait a minute. He doesn't have
his stuff down here.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.428
That's right.

14:14.429 --> 14:18.432
Until you all have better
attitudes, you're in detention.

14:18.433 --> 14:19.684
Detention?

14:21.235 --> 14:24.905
He-he put us in detention
in our own house?

14:24.906 --> 14:27.157
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

14:27.158 --> 14:29.901
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

14:29.902 --> 14:33.288
We-we... uh, okay,
we're gonna deal with that thing

14:33.289 --> 14:35.792
and then we're gonna deal
with detention.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.216
How long is Principal Shepherd

14:44.217 --> 14:46.134
gonna keep us in detention down here?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.969
Oh, you got a big date? Is that it?

14:47.970 --> 14:49.755
Got to get out of here for a big date?

14:49.756 --> 14:52.424
- Is that what you're saying?
- Hey, bite my butt, Mom.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.976
At least I'm not a withered
old slut like you are.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.138
- Oh, just kiss and get it over with.
- Guys, guys, guys.

14:58.139 --> 15:00.807
It's natural that we'd be at
each other's throats, all right?

15:00.808 --> 15:02.359
We've been down here for three minutes.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.444
The question is,
how are we gonna get out?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.396
All right, we're playing.

15:06.397 --> 15:08.148
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Meg, Meg, Meg!

15:09.283 --> 15:10.952
All right, who's next?

15:17.700 --> 15:19.785
Mr. Griffin, you may proceed.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.870
Thank you, Your Honor.
In my case to prove

15:21.871 --> 15:24.873
that Brian Griffin is, in fact,
an idiot, and therefore

15:24.874 --> 15:29.211
cannot be defamed, I call
Brian Griffin to the stand.

15:29.212 --> 15:32.347
Now, Mr. Griffin,
you claim that you are not dumb.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.549
If that is true,
please tell me the difference

15:34.550 --> 15:37.436
between Michael Cera
and Jesse Eisenberg.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.013
Objection.
No one could possibly know that.

15:40.014 --> 15:41.598
Objection sustained.

15:41.599 --> 15:43.817
- You're on thin ice, Counselor.
- Very well.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.603
Now, Mr. Griffin,
I'm going to recite a biography

15:46.604 --> 15:48.939
and I'd like you
to maintain your composure.

15:48.940 --> 15:51.324
"On December 1, 1951,

15:51.325 --> 15:53.160
- Treat Williams was born..."
- Treat? W-Where? Where?

15:53.161 --> 15:54.828
- Where's the treat?
- Thank you.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.581
I will now read the entry
for Christopher Walken.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.241
Walk? Go for a walk?

15:59.242 --> 16:02.711
This dog is dumb.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.162
No further questions, Your Honor.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.581
At this point, I will turn
things over to Brian's lawyer,

16:06.582 --> 16:09.885
the gentleman from Table, Knee,
Bump and Associates.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.670
Thank you, Your Ho... Ah! Son of a dick!

16:11.671 --> 16:13.505
Ah! Ah, crap.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.007
- Right on the bone. Ow!
- Do you wish to proceed?

16:16.008 --> 16:18.344
Huh? No!

16:23.191 --> 16:25.609
Sucks being in detention. I feel like

16:25.610 --> 16:27.394
we're in <i> The Breakfast Club</i>
or something.

16:27.395 --> 16:29.646
I don't know,
maybe we can take this time

16:29.647 --> 16:32.616
- to learn more about each other.
- Sorry, Lois, we can't.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.285
We got to <i> Breakfast Club</i> dance
for the Fox promo.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.914
This Sunday, on an all-new Family Guy,

16:38.915 --> 16:41.449
<i>the Griffins are grounded
and the one actor of color</i>

16:41.450 --> 16:43.285
<i>plays a character named Lawnmower Guy.</i>

16:43.286 --> 16:45.787
<i>Way to go, everyone.</i>

16:45.788 --> 16:49.207
- Now we have this unearned closeness.
- Don't you see?

16:49.208 --> 16:52.210
This must've been why Principal
Shepherd locked us down here.

16:52.211 --> 16:54.212
We've never sat down
and talked like this.

16:54.213 --> 16:56.965
Principal Shepherd
is the best principal ever.

16:56.966 --> 16:58.683
I'm totally reenergized.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.060
Like when my old high school crush

17:00.061 --> 17:02.562
asked to be my friend on Facebook.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.983
Karen Altman?

17:07.984 --> 17:09.819
Wow, that's a blast from the past.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.788
The game begins.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.207
"Hey, cutie. Long time, no talk.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.743
"I'm trapped in Europe
and all I have is my bikini.

17:25.744 --> 17:29.798
Could you wire me $3,000
for old time's sake?"

17:33.970 --> 17:37.131
Beatrice Fuller? She was a snack.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.889
Checkmate.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.827
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.078
We have not, Your Honor.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.947
We all feel we need another night

18:01.948 --> 18:03.748
at the Hyatt with free HBO.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.951
That free HBO was just
a preview. It ended today.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.253
- We have a verdict, Your Honor.
- Please proceed.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.705
The dog is an idiot. The baby wins.

18:10.706 --> 18:12.258
<i>Herf derf!</i>

18:15.595 --> 18:17.128
Well, congrats, Stewie.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.805
You made me look like a fool up there.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.091
I mean, I can't believe
you'd do this to me.

18:21.092 --> 18:22.809
I'll never forgive you.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.728
Who are you kidding, Brian?
You're a dog.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.563
I'm gonna walk out that door,
come back in

18:26.564 --> 18:29.766
and you'll just be excited to see me.

18:29.767 --> 18:31.685
Hey! Hey! You're back!

18:31.686 --> 18:33.570
Oh, man, I feel like
you've been gone forever!

18:33.571 --> 18:35.105
Hey, watch me spin around!

18:35.106 --> 18:37.699
Whoa! Whoa!

18:37.700 --> 18:39.367
Whoa!

18:39.368 --> 18:43.122
Fat ankles.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.493
All right, last call for new business.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.212
And again, we cannot
show you the nude photos

18:51.213 --> 18:54.049
the Spanish teacher sent to that kid.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.084
Well, I guess that's it.
Let's get out of here.

18:56.085 --> 18:58.136
- No, Peter, the other thing.
- Oh, right.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.965
My name is Peter Griffin, and I
get to the "in conclusion" part

19:01.966 --> 19:04.017
of my speech faster than most people.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.635
In conclusion, I think the school

19:05.636 --> 19:07.437
should rehire Principal Shepherd.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.727
Mr. Griffin, you make
a brisk and compelling case.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.945
I hereby reinstate Principal Shepherd.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.658
Yes! I love you, baby.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.193
Sorry, Lois, I needed you out of the way

19:22.194 --> 19:24.246
so I could kiss this lady.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.166
It's good to be back.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.551
Wait, who drew this dong on my desk?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.754
Not me. I wouldn't even
know how to draw one.

19:40.755 --> 19:43.223
I've only seen two: mine
and my uncle's at his funeral.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.258
He died with my aunt in a car crash.

19:45.259 --> 19:47.260
Remember her, from earlier,
with the vagina?

19:47.261 --> 19:49.095
My uncle didn't fall
out of the casket, though.

19:49.096 --> 19:50.980
I stayed late
and unbuckled his trousers.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.649
What were we talking about?

19:52.650 --> 19:55.811
Oh, yeah, your desk got donged.
Yeah, I did it. It was me.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.868
Well, Brian,
thanks for being a good sport

20:03.869 --> 20:06.362
- about the Flunky books.<i>
- No problemo,</i> Stewie.

20:06.363 --> 20:08.081
Aw, I wish you hadn't done that.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.084
If anything, you gave me a good
chance for some self-reflection.

20:11.085 --> 20:14.170
Fact is, you inspired me to get
back to doing some writing.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.755
Wow, it's really you.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.041
Oh, thanks, but I no longer
write the Flunky books.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.093
No, not that book.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.761
This one.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.723
<i>Swishy the Football Baby?</i>

20:24.724 --> 20:26.758
"By Griffin Brian"?

20:26.759 --> 20:28.393
Can you say one of your catchphrases,

20:28.394 --> 20:31.062
like, "Hey, sailor," or "Up for brunch?"

20:31.063 --> 20:33.231
Ooh! How about "I'm a bottom"?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.518
Brian!

20:41.273 --> 20:44.109
- So?
- I'm sorry.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.703
- It's not really our brand.
- I see.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.206
Well, what about <i> Phineas
and Ferb</i> erotic fan fiction?

20:50.207 --> 20:51.624
