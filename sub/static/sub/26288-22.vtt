"NCIS"...

00:01.822 --> 00:03.708
That necklace is beautiful.

00:03.844 --> 00:05.096
My boyfriend gave it to me.

00:05.184 --> 00:06.564
Then your assignment is over.

00:06.652 --> 00:08.249
End the relationship
immediately.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.834
End the
relationship immediately.

00:09.921 --> 00:11.155
Gladly.

00:11.243 --> 00:12.695
Your gift
was a recording device.

00:12.783 --> 00:13.972
Why the hell
are you following me?

00:14.059 --> 00:15.242
This is an off-the-books
account.

00:15.329 --> 00:17.742
Whose is it? United States
Secretary of Defense.

00:17.829 --> 00:21.267
I understand you've been
tracking Leon Vance.

00:22.173 --> 00:23.693
I want everything you have.

00:23.781 --> 00:26.263
<i>Six Klowny Kake ice cream bars</i>

00:26.404 --> 00:29.554
were partially cut open and
laced with strychnine poison.

00:29.641 --> 00:31.304
No DNA, no Crum.

00:31.515 --> 00:33.224
No Crum, no confession.

00:33.311 --> 00:35.476
Mr. Crum, you're free to go.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.996
I've spent years in courtrooms

00:38.083 --> 00:40.064
watching people abuse
the system.

00:40.151 --> 00:42.000
A system that's supposed
to protect the innocent,

00:42.087 --> 00:43.368
not free the guilty.

00:43.455 --> 00:44.869
<i>To balance the scales,</i>

00:44.956 --> 00:46.671
<i>sometimes you have
to apply pressure.</i>

00:46.758 --> 00:49.240
Our hit man was paid with money
from SecDef's secret account?

00:49.327 --> 00:51.335
I'll call Clark.
Have him meet us.

Gibbs?

01:07.593 --> 01:09.101
Director?

01:11.945 --> 01:13.400
Damn.

01:34.726 --> 01:36.070
Hello?

01:36.749 --> 01:38.341
Gibbs?

01:44.917 --> 01:46.464
Westley,
what are you doing?

01:46.551 --> 01:48.566
I could be asking you
the same question.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.401
You've been following me.

01:50.488 --> 01:52.296
- You taught me well.
- Why?

01:52.384 --> 01:54.378
Who are you working for?
You, I thought.

01:54.479 --> 01:55.806
Till you
kicked me out.

01:55.894 --> 01:58.845
I want back in. Whatever it is
you're working on with NCIS,

01:58.933 --> 02:00.111
let me help.

02:00.198 --> 02:02.472
I did teach you well.
Who sent you?

02:02.560 --> 02:05.563
What's wrong with you?
Put the gun down.

02:05.651 --> 02:07.511
I asked you a question.

02:09.245 --> 02:10.329
Stop,

02:10.407 --> 02:12.433
and answer the damn question.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.349
Federal agents!

02:34.849 --> 02:35.980
In here!

02:36.067 --> 02:37.935
- Mallory?
- Leon!

02:38.023 --> 02:39.389
I'm unarmed.

02:42.949 --> 02:44.915
Hands.

02:51.178 --> 02:53.052

You got to be kidding me.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.044
It still works.

03:40.131 --> 03:41.855
Mm, didn't it
used to be in color?

03:46.269 --> 03:48.286
- Hey. Morning, McGee.
- Hey.

03:48.373 --> 03:50.521
Hey, how was your, uh,
trip back in from California?

03:50.608 --> 03:51.923
Early. Who is this?

03:52.010 --> 03:53.958
CIA Officer Clark.

03:54.045 --> 03:55.478
It's a shame, huh?

03:58.483 --> 04:01.466
Nick, you didn't say anything
in your text about a dead body.

04:01.553 --> 04:03.067
Tim, why else
would I text you

04:03.154 --> 04:05.203
to come to Gibbs's house
as soon as you landed?

04:05.290 --> 04:06.804
Well, I can think
of a few reasons.

04:06.891 --> 04:08.272
So what happened here?

04:08.359 --> 04:10.641
Clark was meeting Gibbs.
Mallory got here first.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.410
She said Clark
tried to kill her.

04:12.497 --> 04:13.578
What? Why?

04:13.665 --> 04:15.780
Mallory shot back.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.483
Put one in the TV and
one in Clark's heart.

04:18.570 --> 04:21.052
Self-defense?
According to Mallory.

04:21.139 --> 04:24.027
Okay. Do we believe her?

04:24.620 --> 04:27.097
I acted in self-defense.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.892
I'm telling you the truth, Leon.

04:28.980 --> 04:30.300
Well, that's a first.

04:31.850 --> 04:33.394
Why were you following Clark?

04:34.136 --> 04:36.212
And don't say it's your job.

04:36.300 --> 04:39.337
After Clark pulled me
off your surveillance,

04:39.503 --> 04:41.652
he had my security clearance
downgraded.

04:41.926 --> 04:44.242
It killed my credibility
at the Agency.

04:44.329 --> 04:46.778
I thought I had done something
wrong, but now I think

04:46.865 --> 04:48.980
there's something
that he didn't want me to see.

04:49.496 --> 04:51.707
And I think you all know
what it is.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.328
I want back in.

04:58.527 --> 05:01.025
This was to save face,
professionally?

05:01.277 --> 05:04.514
Do I really need
to say it, Leon?

05:06.935 --> 05:08.332
Gibbs?

05:15.394 --> 05:16.726
Bourbon.

05:22.066 --> 05:23.981
The last time we talked,

05:24.316 --> 05:26.808
I didn't have a chance
to say I'm sorry.

05:27.164 --> 05:29.098
For everything.

05:30.558 --> 05:31.798
I know.

05:31.886 --> 05:35.480
I really did have
feelings for you.

05:35.808 --> 05:38.441
I know.
I was doing my job,

05:38.716 --> 05:40.565
and fell in love.

05:41.722 --> 05:43.660
Which one is wrong?

05:44.489 --> 05:47.338
See? It's not
that easy to answer.

05:47.738 --> 05:50.059
What am I supposed to say
to change all that?

05:52.997 --> 05:56.666
You could say
you feel the same way.

05:58.957 --> 06:00.251
You can say,

06:00.338 --> 06:01.816
in another life,

06:02.006 --> 06:05.043
we'd be planning a vacation
to Cancun right now.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.285
In another life.

06:09.747 --> 06:13.282
But in this one, the CIA
is waiting to interrogate you.

06:17.832 --> 06:20.104
My story won't change.

06:21.066 --> 06:22.625
It's the truth.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.912
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

07:05.203 --> 07:07.251
I believe we are ready to begin.

07:07.338 --> 07:08.886
Your Honor,
is it wise to meet so soon

07:08.973 --> 07:11.122
after your bailiff
was arrested for murder?

07:11.209 --> 07:13.124
NCIS is getting too
close to uncovering

07:13.211 --> 07:14.926
his connection to this council.

07:15.013 --> 07:16.327
McKinney won't talk.

07:16.414 --> 07:19.297
And all remaining funds
have been relocated.

07:19.384 --> 07:23.682
Plus we are taking one
additional precaution.

07:23.975 --> 07:26.742
Have you all reviewed
the information I sent?

07:28.026 --> 07:30.441
Good. Regarding
the murder

07:30.528 --> 07:32.635
of Pedro Juan Hernandez,

07:32.752 --> 07:35.646
how does this council
find the defendant,

07:35.733 --> 07:39.705
Gunnery Sergeant
Leroy Jethro Gibbs?

07:40.371 --> 07:43.354
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

07:43.441 --> 07:45.448
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

07:45.585 --> 07:49.068
Guilty.
The decision is unanimous.

07:49.448 --> 07:51.629
The verdict is so recorded.

07:51.716 --> 07:54.151
Your Honor, with
Bailiff McKinney in custody,

07:54.292 --> 07:57.260
we'll need to find someone
to carry out the sentence.

07:58.092 --> 08:00.025
I already have.

08:05.087 --> 08:06.785
The ice cream
killer, Stuart Crum,

08:06.873 --> 08:10.390
got off on a legal technicality,
and then was murdered.

08:10.477 --> 08:11.624
The man who killed
Crum was an assassin

08:11.711 --> 08:15.094
paid from a secret
account belonging to.

08:15.181 --> 08:17.196
Secretary of Defense.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.300
We don't actually think SecDef
paid for the hit, do we?

08:20.387 --> 08:21.801
I mean, it was his account.

08:21.888 --> 08:23.870
We still don't have proof that
he was controlling it.

08:23.957 --> 08:25.605
So find some.

08:25.692 --> 08:27.707
Follow the money. It's
easier said than done, boss.

08:27.794 --> 08:29.942
We don't have all the records
on SecDef's account.

08:30.029 --> 08:31.411
And our bailiff
hit man's not talking.

08:31.498 --> 08:33.746
No wife, no friends,
no social media.

08:33.832 --> 08:36.115
He's a breathing dead end.
He has a boss, Bishop.

08:36.202 --> 08:37.594
- Start with him.
- Judge Deakin.

08:37.682 --> 08:38.859
- On it.
- Torres.

08:42.780 --> 08:46.221
Boss. I think the best way
to find proof on SecDef

08:46.309 --> 08:47.284
is to just
confront him.

08:47.372 --> 08:48.561
Easier said than done, Tim.

08:48.648 --> 08:50.163
Well, I know Vance
isn't ready to go all in

08:50.250 --> 08:51.597
on this one,
but you don't want to lose

08:51.684 --> 08:53.017
- the element of surprise.
- Too late.

08:55.655 --> 08:57.263
Agent Gibbs.

09:01.087 --> 09:02.942
Maybe you should join us.

09:07.802 --> 09:09.649
Somebody has been accessing

09:09.736 --> 09:13.252
an old offshore account
in my name.

09:13.481 --> 09:16.255
I have no idea who, or why.

09:16.342 --> 09:17.638
Which is why I'm here.

09:17.726 --> 09:19.759
Sunlight is the best
disinfectant, boys.

09:19.846 --> 09:21.508
So, you got questions,

09:21.596 --> 09:22.928
ask away.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.532
- The account.
- What is it?

09:26.619 --> 09:28.059
Take a look.

09:28.421 --> 09:30.103
Asked you, Mr. Secretary.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.538
I was an undersecretary
back in 2002.

09:32.625 --> 09:35.108
Office of Finance. I opened
that account in connection

09:35.195 --> 09:37.343
with several national
security operations.

09:37.430 --> 09:40.313
Off the books? Post
9/11, things moved fast.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.183
Bookkeeping was not at the top
of our list of priorities.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.185
That account
got lost in the shuffle.

09:46.272 --> 09:48.321
Hundreds of millions?
It's D.C., Leon.

09:48.408 --> 09:49.522
Sir, you have DoD,

09:49.609 --> 09:51.524
FBI and a whole host
of federal acronyms

09:51.611 --> 09:54.208
at your disposal.
Why come to us?

09:54.622 --> 09:58.631
Well... last time
our paths crossed,

09:58.718 --> 10:00.299
I didn't like you
peeking under my hood.

10:00.386 --> 10:04.091
So, I decided to take a peek
under yours.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.471
Did you find
what you were looking for?

10:06.559 --> 10:08.841
What I found was
even worse than dirt.

10:08.928 --> 10:12.311
You really are a good man
who runs a tight ship. You both.

10:12.398 --> 10:14.313
- Last man who said that is dead.
- Yeah, well,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.149
I don't know anything
about Clark's death.

10:16.236 --> 10:17.984
But I'm offering you
everything I have.

10:18.071 --> 10:19.986
The offshore
account records

10:20.073 --> 10:21.421
you've been looking for.

10:21.508 --> 10:22.655
All of them.

10:22.742 --> 10:24.842
Now it's your turn.

10:27.223 --> 10:29.996
Can you tell me
who's been using this account?

10:30.083 --> 10:33.918
Not yet. But you do know what
they've been using it for.

10:39.395 --> 10:41.741
Gentlemen,
trust is a two-way street.

10:41.828 --> 10:45.229
Yes, sir. I will let you know
as soon as we have more.

11:08.555 --> 11:12.071
Whoa. Well, I know where I'm
having my next birthday party.

11:12.158 --> 11:14.140
- Where was the last one?
- ShowBiz Pizza.

11:14.227 --> 11:15.875
I was seven.

11:15.962 --> 11:18.711
Special Agents
Bishop and Torres.

11:18.798 --> 11:19.912
Judge Deakin.

11:19.999 --> 11:21.747
Thanks for meeting
me here, uh...

11:21.834 --> 11:24.383
You called just as I was
on my way out of the courthouse.

11:24.470 --> 11:25.985
Yeah, this place
is incredible.

11:26.072 --> 11:28.921
Isn't it?
Labor of love for a long time.

11:29.008 --> 11:30.156
It's yours?

11:30.243 --> 11:31.958
Indeed it is.

11:32.045 --> 11:34.606
I did most of the
restoration myself.

11:34.755 --> 11:36.929
Working with my hands
keeps me sane.

11:37.016 --> 11:39.098
Definitely more fun
than a boat in a basement.

11:39.185 --> 11:40.900
- What's that?
- Long story.

11:40.987 --> 11:43.002
And it's not why you're here.

11:43.089 --> 11:46.153
Your bailiff, Colt McKinney,
he's been arrested for murder.

11:46.241 --> 11:47.273
I heard.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.575
- Awful.
- You've worked with him for six years.

11:49.662 --> 11:51.944
Any signs of this guy
going off the rails?

11:52.031 --> 11:53.613
No.

11:53.700 --> 11:57.750
Although, the job has
its share of frustrations.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.152
Justice is not always served.

12:00.239 --> 12:03.422
Anybody who might want to take
advantage of those frustrations?

12:03.509 --> 12:05.758
We don't think McKinney
was working alone.

12:05.845 --> 12:08.194
Really? What makes you say that?
He got paid for the hit.

12:08.281 --> 12:11.998
Y-You're telling me
my bailiff is a hit man?

12:12.085 --> 12:13.366
For whom?

12:13.453 --> 12:16.122
Well, we were hoping that
you could help us find out.

12:17.423 --> 12:20.640
It breaks my heart
to have the law corrupted.

12:20.727 --> 12:23.209
A bad man gets away
with murder, leading to

12:23.296 --> 12:25.611
a-a man I thought was good
committing it.

12:25.698 --> 12:27.647
Good men don't commit murder.

12:27.734 --> 12:31.239
They shouldn't have to.
The system failed.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.786
That's not exactly what I'd
expect to hear from a judge.

12:34.874 --> 12:36.507
I'm not condoning it.

12:38.145 --> 12:39.692
I'll tell you what,

12:39.779 --> 12:42.213
you sit on the bench for
40 years, and then we'll talk.

12:43.802 --> 12:44.897
Huh?

12:44.984 --> 12:49.168
You two know anything about,
uh, vintage pin setters?

12:49.255 --> 12:51.137
Lane two is on the fritz,

12:51.224 --> 12:52.823
needs a little TLC.

13:02.739 --> 13:04.483
This can't be right.
Check it again.

13:04.570 --> 13:06.895
Because the fifth time's
a charm?

13:07.260 --> 13:10.523
- What do we got?
- We've been processing

13:10.643 --> 13:12.525
- the bank records from SecDef.
- Mm-hmm. And?

13:12.612 --> 13:15.561
Well, what we're finding
is very strange.

13:15.648 --> 13:17.563
I think there's something else
we need to check.

13:17.650 --> 13:20.499
No, we don't.
Just tell him.

13:21.731 --> 13:23.502
Tell him what?
Well,

13:23.589 --> 13:26.098
since you asked, follow me.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.074
So, Stuart Crum,

13:28.220 --> 13:29.874
- aka...
- Ice cream killer.

13:29.962 --> 13:31.877
Guilty, but he got off
on a technicality.

13:31.964 --> 13:33.512
The next day,
Crum is found dead,

13:33.599 --> 13:35.514
and we know that the
hit man who killed him

13:35.602 --> 13:36.942
was paid out of
SecDef's account.

13:37.030 --> 13:39.051
But check this out,
we found six

13:39.138 --> 13:41.087
other withdrawals
from that same account

13:41.174 --> 13:42.855
over the past
three years.

13:42.942 --> 13:44.590
Each one was sent
to a city that,

13:44.677 --> 13:46.592
just the week before,
had a high-profile murder case

13:46.679 --> 13:48.761
get dismissed
by a technicality.

13:48.848 --> 13:51.434
In each case, the suspected
killer ends up dead.

13:51.522 --> 13:54.841
I mean, holy vigilante
justice, Batman,

13:54.929 --> 13:57.542
but in this case, it's like
a nationwide network

13:57.630 --> 13:58.970
of vigilante justice.

13:59.058 --> 14:00.640
Someone is having
killers killed.

14:00.727 --> 14:02.742
Who? Don't know. 
The money's a dead end.

14:02.829 --> 14:04.577
Assuming SecDef
is telling the truth,

14:04.664 --> 14:07.880
there's no way to track exactly
who's controlling his account.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.148
Find a way, Kase.

14:09.235 --> 14:10.416
Boss, you really buying this?

14:10.503 --> 14:12.952
Got anything else, McGee?

14:13.039 --> 14:16.168
Yeah, I'm buying it.

14:17.316 --> 14:18.833
He must be tired.

14:23.049 --> 14:24.885
Anything else, Gibbs?

14:24.973 --> 14:26.666
Nah, just the usual
would be great. Thanks.

14:26.754 --> 14:28.067
Working on that boat again, huh?

14:28.154 --> 14:29.620
Four coffees
coming up.

15:27.788 --> 15:29.102
Anybody got staples?

15:29.189 --> 15:32.124
Yeah. Heads up.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.609
A network of
vigilante justice?

15:35.696 --> 15:38.445
No matter how many times
you say it out loud, it still

15:38.532 --> 15:40.314
sounds like every
comic book ever.

15:40.401 --> 15:41.815
Everybody likes superheroes.

15:41.902 --> 15:43.884
Superman doesn't
hire hit men, Nick.

15:43.971 --> 15:45.752
Yeah, but he takes down
criminals

15:45.839 --> 15:47.454
that the system can't catch.

15:47.541 --> 15:50.290
Yeah, but he also leaps tall
buildings in a single bound,

15:50.377 --> 15:52.159
so let's stick to reality here.

15:52.246 --> 15:53.260
Murder is murder.

15:53.347 --> 15:55.128
I agree.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.164
We need to find out who is
controlling this network.

15:57.251 --> 15:59.466
I agree.
So we all agree.

15:59.553 --> 16:00.901
So what's
the problem?

16:00.988 --> 16:02.736
The problem is...

16:02.823 --> 16:04.104
where is Gibbs?

16:04.191 --> 16:06.340
I mean, there should be
three cups of coffee

16:06.427 --> 16:10.410
in the trash by now. Zero cups.

16:10.497 --> 16:11.845
Yeah, and how often
do we get

16:11.932 --> 16:14.669
this far into a discussion
before he appears behind...

16:17.434 --> 16:19.119
See, that's why
I didn't say anything,

16:19.206 --> 16:22.255
'cause as soon as I did...
Okay.

16:22.342 --> 16:23.523
Yeah, this is weird.

16:23.610 --> 16:25.592
It's not like Gibbs
to not show up for work.

16:25.679 --> 16:26.860
We should check on him.

16:26.947 --> 16:29.181
- Oh, good luck with that.
- Yeah, that's all you.

16:30.517 --> 16:33.000
I'm-I'm gonna go help, uh,
Kasie find a connection.

16:33.087 --> 16:34.201
Yeah, and I'm gonna

16:34.288 --> 16:36.036
pull case files
on our six murder dots.

16:36.123 --> 16:38.161
Oh, my God.
What are you two scared of?

16:39.426 --> 16:40.774
Gibbs will appreciate the fact

16:40.861 --> 16:42.342
that we are concerned about him.

16:42.429 --> 16:45.739
Yeah. He appreciates when people
are up in his business.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.197
So, what do you think?

17:37.284 --> 17:41.005
Well, it doesn't seem like
a matter of opinion, Leon.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.604
Jimmy's autopsy report,
Kasie's forensics report,

17:44.691 --> 17:46.239
the CIA independent
investigation,

17:46.326 --> 17:47.607
they all say
the same thing.

17:47.694 --> 17:49.356
Mallory's story checks out.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.325
For once.

17:51.413 --> 17:54.096
But you didn't need me
to tell you that, Leon,

17:54.184 --> 17:55.882
so what do you need?

17:56.227 --> 17:57.460
Closure.

18:01.608 --> 18:02.889
Oh.

18:03.763 --> 18:06.126
Oh...

18:06.481 --> 18:09.130
You actually fell
for this woman, huh?

18:11.051 --> 18:12.866
Cupid usually shoots arrows,

18:12.953 --> 18:15.702
but you're walking around with
a harpoon in your chest, huh?

18:15.789 --> 18:17.471
It's over. I know that, Jack.

18:17.558 --> 18:19.231
Do you?

18:20.194 --> 18:22.138
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

18:24.131 --> 18:25.779
Could I have done something
a little different?

18:26.419 --> 18:27.911
Oh...

18:27.999 --> 18:29.380
Leon, honey...

18:29.981 --> 18:32.586
This is not your fault.

18:32.864 --> 18:35.550
When I first put together
that she was CIA,

18:35.638 --> 18:37.020
I could've called her out.

18:37.223 --> 18:39.721
You put the security
of this agency

18:39.809 --> 18:41.061
above your
personal feelings.

18:41.148 --> 18:42.929
But I don't think
that's a good foundation

18:43.016 --> 18:44.231
for happily ever after.

18:44.318 --> 18:46.266
Maybe you need
to lower the bar a bit.

18:46.353 --> 18:48.768
If your goal
is "happily ever after,"

18:48.855 --> 18:50.637
I think you got into
the wrong business.

18:50.724 --> 18:53.106
Or maybe you should
just date a librarian,

18:53.193 --> 18:54.508
so you won't have
this problem again.

18:54.595 --> 18:58.945
Stay away from undercover
CIA agents, that's your advice?

18:59.032 --> 19:02.249
I mean, it's practical.

19:02.466 --> 19:05.270
But this isn't about finding
someone new, is it?

19:07.314 --> 19:10.723
Hey, Gibbs, checking in, again.

19:14.348 --> 19:16.363
Hey, Elaine!

19:17.145 --> 19:18.932
Agent Bishop.
What happened here?

19:19.019 --> 19:21.334
Gibbs happened.
He didn't tell you?

19:21.421 --> 19:22.536
Tell me what?

19:22.669 --> 19:25.205
Late last night,
Gibbs was heading home.

19:25.403 --> 19:27.534
Next thing I know,
we heard shots outside.

19:27.622 --> 19:28.659
Gunshots?

19:28.747 --> 19:30.610
Gibbs is okay, didn't even
spill his coffees.

19:30.697 --> 19:33.346
So wh-who did the shooting?
What did the police find?

19:33.433 --> 19:36.283
Not Gibbs. He took off
before the cops got here.

19:36.370 --> 19:38.552
And after fielding questions
with these yahoos all night,

19:38.639 --> 19:39.786
I understand why.

19:39.873 --> 19:42.322
I told them I didn't see
who was shooting.

19:42.409 --> 19:45.458
Matter of fact, I didn't
tell them who was shot at.

19:45.545 --> 19:48.480
I assumed Gibbs left
for a reason.

19:50.584 --> 19:52.832
You sure that it was Gibbs'
truck that was hit?

19:52.919 --> 19:54.034
Where did he go?

19:54.121 --> 19:55.457
I-I told you
everything I know.

19:55.545 --> 19:56.703
I just want to say,

19:56.790 --> 20:00.073
any time you guys need a safe,
secluded space for gossip,

20:00.160 --> 20:03.951
Autopsy's all yours.
Gets really lonely down here.

20:04.396 --> 20:06.713
So what are we supposed
to say to Gibbs?

20:06.800 --> 20:07.981
Um, nothing.

20:08.068 --> 20:09.482
We're just gonna ignore this?

20:09.569 --> 20:11.184
As opposed to...?
I don't know,

20:11.271 --> 20:13.420
talk to him. I mean,
you had the guts to fire him.

20:13.507 --> 20:14.454
And I lived to talk about it.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.922
You think I'm gonna
push my luck?

20:16.009 --> 20:19.192
So no one's gonna confront Gibbs?
About what?

20:19.279 --> 20:21.661
Gibbs! These guys
just showed up down here.

20:21.748 --> 20:24.864
I-I told you, I have work
to do, people.

20:25.943 --> 20:26.996
Update.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.529
I left you a couple
messages this morning.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.235
Is everything okay?

20:31.449 --> 20:33.764
Car trouble. Update.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.408
Ah, Agent Torres,

20:35.495 --> 20:37.510
there you are.

20:37.597 --> 20:40.880
- Am I, uh, interrupting?
- Uh, no. I was

20:40.967 --> 20:42.449
just about to tell Gibbs that I

20:42.536 --> 20:44.105
came to you for
some information.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.787
And, clearly,
here you are

20:47.115 --> 20:49.556
- with that information.
- Indeed I am.

20:49.643 --> 20:53.960
I pulled the records of your
six vigilante murder cases,

20:54.047 --> 20:57.297
and I discovered an
intriguing connection.

20:57.384 --> 20:58.865
What kind of connection, Duck?

20:58.952 --> 21:02.569
These six murders
span four states,

21:02.656 --> 21:04.437
each in a different city,

21:04.524 --> 21:08.608
each in a different jurisdiction
with different judges.

21:08.695 --> 21:10.977
However, on closer inspection,

21:11.064 --> 21:13.246
each of these
four judges

21:13.333 --> 21:15.600
have something
in common.

21:18.739 --> 21:21.573
They all clerked for one man.

21:24.215 --> 21:25.816
Judge Deakin.

21:25.912 --> 21:28.595
A federal judge running
a vigilante network?

21:28.682 --> 21:29.963
We can't prove anything.

21:30.050 --> 21:33.066
No, not yet.

21:33.153 --> 21:35.353
Keep digging.

21:36.490 --> 21:38.305
Okay, where is he going now?

21:38.392 --> 21:40.173
Damn good question.

21:40.260 --> 21:43.810
As NCIS historian, I have become
somewhat isolated

21:43.897 --> 21:45.345
down in my new office,

21:45.432 --> 21:47.914
but since when has
Gibbs' whereabouts been

21:48.001 --> 21:49.816
so hotly contested?

21:49.903 --> 21:51.369
Don't ask, Duck.

22:00.678 --> 22:03.627
Wood shifts.

22:03.902 --> 22:05.350
Hard to keep
an even surface.

22:05.585 --> 22:06.966
Preaching to the choir.

22:07.053 --> 22:10.437
Anything beats
synthetic lanes.

22:10.524 --> 22:13.553
Even if it means maintaining
the wood's original shape.

22:15.631 --> 22:17.467
Original shape's a tree.

22:17.873 --> 22:19.498
Funny.

22:19.766 --> 22:21.381
I thought I locked that door.

22:21.468 --> 22:23.283
You did.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.804
I think you dropped this.

22:28.607 --> 22:30.222
Looks like
a charming fellow.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.324
You know him?

22:31.779 --> 22:33.084
I did.

22:33.172 --> 22:36.920
He killed my family.
Now he's dead.

22:38.785 --> 22:40.400
What's this about,
Agent Gibbs?

22:40.487 --> 22:44.571
You want me dead?
Here I am.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.216
Want you dead?

22:50.230 --> 22:52.623
This have something to do
with this photo?

22:53.006 --> 22:55.215
He doesn't look like
he died of old age.

22:55.302 --> 22:57.131
You want to judge me, Judge?

22:57.404 --> 23:00.701
Man up.
Do your own dirty work.

23:01.067 --> 23:03.193
Man up?

23:04.143 --> 23:05.991
Like you did?

23:06.521 --> 23:08.561
You put your thumb
on the scale

23:08.648 --> 23:11.381
and created justice
where there was none,

23:11.630 --> 23:13.396
and made the world right.

23:13.521 --> 23:15.435
No, not even close.

23:16.537 --> 23:17.659
Needed to be done.

23:17.747 --> 23:19.595
But now you want me dead
for it.

23:19.888 --> 23:24.381
You condemn me for something
I did years ago...

23:25.076 --> 23:26.287
while you're still doing it.

23:26.466 --> 23:27.678
That's an interesting theory,

23:27.766 --> 23:30.053
but you can't prove
a word of it.

23:30.141 --> 23:32.224
Maybe that's why you came alone?

23:33.419 --> 23:37.856
Or maybe, deep down,
you really believe

23:37.944 --> 23:40.396
in justice at all costs.

23:43.550 --> 23:45.248
Not about justice.

23:46.201 --> 23:48.568
Justice is your excuse.

23:49.615 --> 23:52.264
Because I'm coming for you...

23:53.960 --> 23:55.493
and you're scared.

23:57.197 --> 23:59.107
And you're alone.

24:00.795 --> 24:03.583
Because they don't know
what you did, do they?

24:03.701 --> 24:05.115
Your team.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.275
And you're too ashamed
to tell 'em the truth.

24:13.647 --> 24:15.562
Agent Gibbs, I think
we're accusing each other

24:15.649 --> 24:18.264
of the same thing.

24:18.351 --> 24:20.084
Maybe we're on the same team.

24:22.521 --> 24:23.817
No, we're not.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.461
Morning, Nick.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.020
Hey, yo.

25:08.441 --> 25:09.799
Was that meant for us?

25:09.887 --> 25:11.335
Or did he just have a stroke?

25:11.422 --> 25:12.895
Excuse me.

25:14.965 --> 25:17.040
The last man who made
that hand gesture at me

25:17.127 --> 25:18.208
is now missing a hand.

25:18.295 --> 25:20.344
What? It means "campfire."

25:20.431 --> 25:21.593
Then just say campfire.

25:21.681 --> 25:23.781
Campfire. Now.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.556
Hey, what's up?

25:32.643 --> 25:35.143
We have a problem.

25:36.613 --> 25:38.128
I followed Gibbs last night.

25:38.215 --> 25:40.063
Uh, that's a <i> you</i> problem.

25:40.150 --> 25:41.531
He's not gonna be happy
about that.

25:41.618 --> 25:44.368
He went to the judge
without telling us.

25:44.455 --> 25:45.869
- Why is he cutting us out?
- I don't know.

25:45.956 --> 25:47.827
But it has to do with
the shooting at the diner.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.473
I see how this looks.
Bad.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.541
Well, what are we supposed to do?
We supposed to step in

25:51.628 --> 25:53.644
every time boss makes
a move without telling us?

25:53.731 --> 25:55.145
This is different.

25:55.232 --> 25:57.148
I mean, the guy's car
just got sprayed with bullets,

25:57.236 --> 25:58.288
and we have no idea why.

25:58.376 --> 26:01.184
We can't do our jobs
if we're always in the dark.

26:01.271 --> 26:02.753
Maybe he's trying to protect us.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.721
From what?
If we're in danger,

26:04.808 --> 26:06.572
wouldn't-wouldn't you want
to know?

26:06.680 --> 26:08.991
McGee, you have to handle this.

26:09.079 --> 26:10.994
Yeah, I can't keep
firing Gibbs.

26:11.081 --> 26:12.367
Just talk to him.

26:12.455 --> 26:15.085
All right, fine.
But if I crash and burn,

26:15.173 --> 26:16.822
you two are coming with.

26:32.862 --> 26:34.829
Update. Go.

26:42.869 --> 26:46.455
Actually, boss, before that...

26:54.634 --> 26:55.783
Nope.

26:56.447 --> 26:58.141
What does he mean, "nope"?

26:58.229 --> 27:00.345
We didn't even say anything.
McGee.

27:20.644 --> 27:22.610
Boss, we should talk.

27:27.257 --> 27:28.472
Look, whatever's going on,

27:28.559 --> 27:30.892
we need to know,
no matter what it is.

27:35.626 --> 27:37.210
It's personal.

27:37.298 --> 27:39.611
Shooting at the diner,
maybe?

27:40.290 --> 27:41.952
Yeah, we know about that.

27:42.039 --> 27:43.759
We're detectives.

27:44.041 --> 27:45.989
But once you talked
to the judge,

27:46.076 --> 27:47.424
you made it about the case.

27:47.511 --> 27:49.192
The two have to
be connected.

27:49.279 --> 27:52.156
Now, I get it if you don't want
to tell us why, boss,

27:52.244 --> 27:54.384
but after all we've
been through with you,

27:54.472 --> 27:56.032
you think there's anything
you could say

27:56.119 --> 27:57.642
that would surprise us?

27:58.580 --> 28:01.658
I killed the man
who killed my family.

28:05.021 --> 28:07.509
Deakin knows.

28:08.313 --> 28:11.848
He's using it against me
to get me off this case.

28:42.087 --> 28:44.655
And don't ever follow me again!

28:53.728 --> 28:56.693
I was just on my way up.

28:56.780 --> 28:58.762
Unless this is a bad time.

28:58.849 --> 29:01.986
What do you got?
I got a whole heap of lies.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.509
I postponed a sit-down

29:12.596 --> 29:13.890
with the Turkish defense
minister for this.

29:13.978 --> 29:15.445
I hope you have news.
We do, sir.

29:15.533 --> 29:18.200
Good.
Not for you.

29:22.139 --> 29:23.620
What's this?
Phone records.

29:23.707 --> 29:24.921
Do you recognize your number?

29:25.008 --> 29:26.790
It seems that you
and CIA Officer

29:26.877 --> 29:28.625
Mallory Madden
have been awfully chatty.

29:28.712 --> 29:30.594
A fact that you both
have failed to mention.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.244
About that two-way street.

29:32.524 --> 29:34.158
Yeah, well,

29:34.246 --> 29:35.732
Mallory came to me,
told me that Clark

29:35.819 --> 29:37.801
had been nosing around
my old account.

29:37.888 --> 29:39.636
Out of the goodness
of her heart, I'm sure.

29:39.723 --> 29:42.038
She'd been demoted and needed
some new friends in high places,

29:42.125 --> 29:43.773
and I wanted to know
what Clark was up to.

29:43.860 --> 29:45.242
So I asked her to find out.

29:45.329 --> 29:47.087
At all costs?
No.

29:47.364 --> 29:49.312
I never asked her to kill Clark.

29:49.399 --> 29:51.314
And when I found out
she had,

29:51.401 --> 29:52.983
I came to you.
Yeah, and you lied.

29:53.070 --> 29:54.818
I withheld,
because it looked bad.

29:54.905 --> 29:56.838
Still does.

29:58.308 --> 29:59.923
Where's Mallory now?
I have no idea.

30:00.010 --> 30:01.157
I gave her the
account records,

30:01.244 --> 30:03.493
told her to keep digging,
and then nothing.

30:03.580 --> 30:04.961
She must have found something
more valuable

30:05.048 --> 30:06.263
than friends in high places.

30:06.350 --> 30:08.131
Such as?
You tell me.

30:08.218 --> 30:10.400
I was hoping NCIS had something
in the works.

30:10.487 --> 30:12.636
Hey, Gibbs.
Yeah, Kase.

30:12.723 --> 30:15.005
I'm on my way down.
What's that?

30:15.092 --> 30:17.525
Something in the works.

30:21.165 --> 30:23.280
So I dusted the image
for fingerprints,

30:23.367 --> 30:25.148
and other than yours,
I found none.

30:25.235 --> 30:27.584
Totally clean.
The bullets?

30:27.671 --> 30:30.754
You did a great job of
digging them out of your truck.

30:30.841 --> 30:32.155
They're all totally intact.

30:32.242 --> 30:33.323
Also totally clean.

30:33.822 --> 30:36.259
Gotta have something here, Kase.
Oh.

30:36.346 --> 30:38.461
Well, that brings me back to the photo.
You said it was clean.

30:38.548 --> 30:40.463
There's normal forensics
scientist clean,

30:40.550 --> 30:42.499
and then there's
Kasie Hines clean.

30:42.586 --> 30:45.969
So this is the computer
program I ran after making

30:46.056 --> 30:47.704
a super high-res scan.

30:47.791 --> 30:50.140
If there is anything unusual,
this thing will find it.

30:50.227 --> 30:51.942
It could find a flaw in Beyoncé.

30:52.029 --> 30:53.310
Did it?
Beyoncé?

30:53.397 --> 30:55.259
No. Photo, yes.

30:55.899 --> 30:58.848
While there are no latent prints
on the image,

30:58.935 --> 31:01.051
I found a partial print
in the image itself.

31:01.138 --> 31:03.453
In the ink.
Somebody touched it?

31:03.540 --> 31:06.690
Right after it was printed,
just before the ink dried.

31:06.777 --> 31:07.861
Well, run it.

31:07.970 --> 31:09.559
I have been.
Yeah? And?

31:09.654 --> 31:11.314
Still running.

31:12.892 --> 31:15.732
So, uh, this photo was
on your dashboard

31:15.819 --> 31:17.334
while you were being shot at.

31:17.421 --> 31:19.033
You want to tell me
who this man is?

31:19.603 --> 31:21.470
The print, Kase.

31:21.869 --> 31:24.541
Well, it's a partial print,
which greatly increases

31:24.628 --> 31:26.176
the number of potential matches.

31:26.263 --> 31:27.911
But the odds of getting
an immediate hit

31:27.998 --> 31:30.413
on any print are--

31:30.500 --> 31:31.648
Huh. I got a hit.

31:31.735 --> 31:32.922
You got a name?

31:33.500 --> 31:37.930
It belongs to CIA Officer
Mallory Madden.

31:39.076 --> 31:41.383
Isn't that...
The director's ex-girlfriend.

31:41.471 --> 31:43.829
Well, the director's
ex-girlfriend tried to kill you.

31:52.274 --> 31:54.938
Mallory doesn't usually miss
her target.

31:55.321 --> 31:56.813
Yeah, I've seen.

31:58.562 --> 32:00.555
Then why are you
still breathing?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.446
I got a lot of questions.

32:02.533 --> 32:04.214
Like why is my ex
trying to kill you?

32:04.301 --> 32:06.227
I'm not the one
who broke her heart.

32:06.610 --> 32:08.024
I'm guessing

32:08.125 --> 32:09.324
it was about money.

32:10.157 --> 32:11.521
She's working
for Judge Deakin.

32:11.608 --> 32:12.656
But how did
she find him?

32:12.743 --> 32:14.124
Same way we did.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.392
SecDef gave her
the account records.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.794
The same records he gave us.

32:17.881 --> 32:19.457
And she followed
those same breadcrumbs

32:19.545 --> 32:21.547
all the way to Deakin? When?
It doesn't matter.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.102
Yeah, it does. It does to me.

32:23.235 --> 32:24.801
We only need her
to get to Deakin.

32:24.888 --> 32:27.106
Down in the basement, Gibbs,
was she telling the truth?

32:27.196 --> 32:29.206
Did she know what was going on
the entire time?

32:29.579 --> 32:31.359
Leon, you're asking
the wrong person.

32:32.938 --> 32:35.030
Let's find her.

32:40.037 --> 32:44.498
Thanks. Okay, FAA and TSA have
Mallory on a watch list.

32:44.586 --> 32:46.100
Border checkpoints
are on high alert.

32:46.188 --> 32:48.492
Still waiting on a list
of her known aliases.

32:48.579 --> 32:50.994
CIA has me on hold, again.

32:51.081 --> 32:52.529
And no activity
on her Internet accounts,

32:52.616 --> 32:54.302
and her cell phone
is still turned off.

32:54.390 --> 32:55.432
Yeah.

32:55.519 --> 32:56.666
Great. Can you
send me those?

32:56.753 --> 32:59.336
The aliases are on their way.

32:59.423 --> 33:01.975
About time. Where are we?

33:02.110 --> 33:04.466
Mallory's cell hasn't
been used in days.

33:04.554 --> 33:05.742
The Agency hasn't heard from her

33:05.829 --> 33:08.044
since she was cleared
in Clark's death.

33:08.131 --> 33:10.130
Yeah, no hits
on the BOLO, either.

33:10.218 --> 33:11.848
Mallory's a trained
CIA operative.

33:11.935 --> 33:13.250
She knows how to disappear.

33:13.337 --> 33:14.583
Well, she's
not going anywhere

33:14.671 --> 33:16.019
until she finishes
her job.

33:16.106 --> 33:17.554
By job, you mean...

33:17.641 --> 33:18.997
Putting a bullet in my head.

33:19.085 --> 33:19.694
Hey, boss,

33:19.782 --> 33:21.264
I've got something here.

33:21.504 --> 33:24.382
Mallory just turned on her
cell phone and her GPS tracker.

33:24.615 --> 33:26.733
So either our
CIA operative is sloppy,

33:26.821 --> 33:27.865
or it's a trap.

33:27.953 --> 33:29.991
She's not sloppy. Where is she?

33:31.054 --> 33:32.413
She's at your diner.

33:35.959 --> 33:39.546
Hey. Come on, all of you.
Let's go.

33:45.702 --> 33:48.385
That's good.
I like to leave room for cream.

33:48.472 --> 33:49.619
Can I get you anything else?

33:49.706 --> 33:51.573
No. Thank you.

34:04.821 --> 34:05.936
Good coffee here.

34:06.023 --> 34:08.255
Keep both hands
on the table.

34:13.429 --> 34:15.178
I'm not here to fight.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.350
I'm here to turn myself in.

34:18.402 --> 34:20.866
Figured this was
as good a place as any.

34:21.150 --> 34:22.617
Get up.

34:24.944 --> 34:26.623
I screwed up.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.632
Tell Leon
this was just business.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.601
Tell him yourself.

34:32.869 --> 34:35.752
After everything that's
happened with Leon, Clark, you,

34:35.886 --> 34:38.772
this woman turns
herself in? Why?

34:39.413 --> 34:40.621
Hoping to find out.

34:40.710 --> 34:43.639
You think it's wise to send
a jilted lover into that room?

34:43.795 --> 34:45.530
It's not my call.

34:47.445 --> 34:49.011
Gibbs.

34:51.975 --> 34:53.686
You have the right
to remain silent.

34:53.781 --> 34:56.348
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

34:56.436 --> 34:58.388
- in a court of law.
- I've been read my rights.

34:58.475 --> 35:00.122
You have the right
to an attorney, and to have

35:00.210 --> 35:01.559
an attorney present
for any questioning.

35:01.647 --> 35:03.627
Leon, stop. What are you doing?

35:03.714 --> 35:05.372
Doing my job.
Which is what you were doing

35:05.460 --> 35:06.663
before you became
a gun for hire.

35:06.750 --> 35:09.100
I can explain.
Please do.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.093
Over the past few weeks,
I lost everything

35:12.181 --> 35:16.007
that mattered to me.
My credibility, my job and then you.

35:16.452 --> 35:17.755
Clark's murder.

35:17.843 --> 35:19.075
It really was self-defense.

35:19.162 --> 35:21.093
Even your own investigation
says so.

35:21.181 --> 35:23.747
But you knew about the account
and you knew about Judge Deakin.

35:23.834 --> 35:25.767
- Yes.
- You lied to me.

35:27.741 --> 35:29.210
You were working for Deakin.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.169
Only after you said
we had no future,

35:31.257 --> 35:33.256
which meant I needed
a way to start over.

35:33.343 --> 35:35.091
As a hit man?

35:35.561 --> 35:37.093
What the hell is wrong with you?

35:37.180 --> 35:39.637
It was gonna be enough money
to leave the country

35:39.725 --> 35:40.664
and put all of this behind me.

35:40.751 --> 35:41.898
Do you know how crazy
that sounds?

35:41.985 --> 35:43.233
I didn't at the time.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.987
But once I learned
the target was Gibbs,

35:46.075 --> 35:47.641
I couldn't go through with it.

35:48.961 --> 35:51.628
Do you really think
I missed by accident?

35:53.130 --> 35:55.779
I made a deal with Judge Deakin
to take Gibbs out,

35:55.866 --> 35:58.216
so I had to make it
look believable.

35:58.304 --> 36:00.917
Otherwise, I'd be the one
with a bullet in my head.

36:01.004 --> 36:02.452
Ah, so you're the victim?

36:02.539 --> 36:04.022
No.

36:04.233 --> 36:06.882
But I did buy Gibbs some time.

36:08.111 --> 36:10.093
And now I have
something else to offer.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.453
Of course you do. There's
always an angle with you.

36:12.541 --> 36:13.622
Okay. No more.

36:13.710 --> 36:15.507
We're done.

36:20.523 --> 36:22.205
Talk.

36:22.656 --> 36:24.207
Judge Deakin.

36:24.294 --> 36:27.911
He hired me personally,
and I'm willing to testify.

36:27.998 --> 36:31.114
Oh, that's great. The word of
a lying, disgraced CIA officer

36:31.201 --> 36:33.650
against that of a
respected federal judge.

36:33.737 --> 36:35.385
You don't have to take
my word for it.

36:35.472 --> 36:37.338
Then whose?

36:54.234 --> 36:56.820
I heard you come in this time.

36:58.281 --> 36:59.943
Welcome back, Gibbs.

37:00.030 --> 37:01.077
Change your mind?

37:01.164 --> 37:02.245
No.

37:02.332 --> 37:03.703
What, then?

37:03.900 --> 37:06.430
Come to kill me, too,
just like old Pedro?

37:08.578 --> 37:09.875
No more games.

37:09.992 --> 37:11.706
You want me dead?

37:14.765 --> 37:16.476
Pick it up,
pull the trigger.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.413
Take responsibility.

37:36.148 --> 37:38.214
You scratched the wood.
Pick it up!

37:38.586 --> 37:40.414
And give you a reason
to arrest me?

37:40.543 --> 37:42.109
Is it even loaded?

37:49.726 --> 37:52.213
I'm not gonna shoot you, Gibbs.

37:55.984 --> 37:57.534
You may regret that.

37:58.281 --> 37:59.903
What the hell are you doing?

38:00.037 --> 38:01.375
You're under arrest.

38:03.059 --> 38:05.234
Brought my team this time.

38:07.273 --> 38:08.645
You're gonna put a man
like me in chains,

38:08.732 --> 38:10.480
you better have
a damn good reason.

38:10.567 --> 38:12.515
Oh, we do.
We got Mallory.

38:12.602 --> 38:13.912
She had a lot to say.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.152
Oh, what is this, Gibbs?

38:16.398 --> 38:18.588
You think her word
carries any weight? No.

38:18.675 --> 38:20.031
But yours do.

38:21.242 --> 38:22.638
What happened?

38:22.726 --> 38:23.860
Why isn't Gibbs dead?

38:23.947 --> 38:25.695
I need more time.

38:25.782 --> 38:27.754
Maybe I need
to hire a better shot.

38:27.842 --> 38:28.990
That recording

38:29.078 --> 38:30.333
was illegally obtained.

38:30.420 --> 38:32.936
Virginia is a one-party consent
state for recording.

38:33.023 --> 38:34.967
You, of all people,
should know that.

38:35.055 --> 38:38.523
You should also know
not to trust a spy.

38:39.660 --> 38:41.008
Recognize this?

38:41.096 --> 38:42.178
You should.

38:42.265 --> 38:44.305
Mallory was wearing it
when you hired her.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.015
She set me up.

38:46.141 --> 38:47.930
Yeah, tell it to the judge.

38:57.906 --> 38:59.461
Your challenge coin.

38:59.773 --> 39:01.865
I had new ones made up
when I was appointed to the job

39:01.953 --> 39:02.799
five years ago.

39:02.886 --> 39:05.101
Highest rank gets
free drinks at the bar.

39:05.312 --> 39:06.903
There's only one coin
higher than this.

39:06.990 --> 39:09.439
I'm supposed to give them out
as a sign of respect

39:09.526 --> 39:10.774
and admiration.

39:10.861 --> 39:12.052
This is my first.

39:12.140 --> 39:13.185
I don't know what to say.

39:13.273 --> 39:15.145
You tracked the missing
funds to Judge Deakin.

39:15.232 --> 39:19.282
Meaning NCIS has officially
saved my ass, again.

39:19.898 --> 39:23.154
We just did our job, sir.
Anything you need, Leon,

39:23.242 --> 39:24.320
you call me.

39:24.407 --> 39:25.755
Sir, I...
Leon.

39:25.842 --> 39:27.148
Anything.

39:27.273 --> 39:28.977
Thank you.

39:35.805 --> 39:37.433
Director Vance.

39:38.078 --> 39:40.109
Wow, nice.

39:40.273 --> 39:41.404
That going on display?

39:41.491 --> 39:44.021
No, that's going in my pocket
for a rainy day.

39:44.109 --> 39:46.086
Oh.
What can I do for you, Jack?

39:46.625 --> 39:48.011
How you doing, Leon?

39:48.098 --> 39:49.579
- I'm good.
- Really?

39:49.666 --> 39:53.047
Harpoons can leave
a hell of a scar.

39:53.656 --> 39:54.748
Really.

39:54.821 --> 39:56.875
Really? Good.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.547
Anything else?

39:58.664 --> 40:00.039
I saw that Mallory's plea deal

40:00.127 --> 40:01.455
went through.
You didn't block it.

40:01.611 --> 40:03.154
But I didn't endorse it, either.

40:03.242 --> 40:05.047
Fair enough. Hey.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.609
I know a few librarians,

40:08.697 --> 40:10.553
if you're ever looking
to get back in the game.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.768
Eventually.

40:11.855 --> 40:13.359
Thanks, Jack.

40:27.095 --> 40:29.930
That's great news.
I'll let them know.

40:30.508 --> 40:32.522
Well, that was
the Justice Department.

40:32.609 --> 40:35.525
Deakin's plea was enough to get
the other four judges arrested.

40:35.612 --> 40:37.227
Judge Badass sang like a bird.

40:37.314 --> 40:39.461
I know he's a murderer,
but does anyone else want to go

40:39.549 --> 40:42.031
bowl a few games before
that place gets shut down?

40:42.118 --> 40:44.467
I don't think
his restoration skills

40:44.554 --> 40:47.203
are gonna translate
to cinder blocks so well.

40:47.430 --> 40:48.796
So?

40:50.260 --> 40:51.708
Right.

40:51.795 --> 40:56.246
Anybody want to talk about it?

40:56.333 --> 40:59.336
If Deakin had anything
concrete against Gibbs,

40:59.477 --> 41:03.045
he would've used the actual
justice system, not his own.

41:04.307 --> 41:07.241
Do you guys think that Gibbs
will want us to bring it up?

41:09.846 --> 41:11.194
You know.

41:11.281 --> 41:13.396
Pedro Hernandez.
