05:05.305 --> 05:05.338
- Try it.
- I don't want to try it.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.669
- Try it.
- I don't want to try it.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.502
Try it. Just go <i>...</i>

05:09.542 --> 05:11.305
Now breathe in through your nose.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.368
Hold your breath. Now scream.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.509
No. Watch.

05:17.884 --> 05:18.976
Try it.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.178
Louder.

05:29.796 --> 05:30.820
Hi.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.766
I want to welcome you all to the Institute.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.102
My name is Tim,
and I'm the leader of this Marathon Group.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.670
Leader's a bit strong.
Actually, I'm your guide.

05:44.744 --> 05:48.009
As you know, we're going to try to go
24 hours without a break.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.744
And we'll have two one-hour breaks
for food...

05:52.151 --> 05:54.483
and, as far as sleep is concerned,
that's up to you.

05:54.554 --> 05:58.388
There are no rules here.
If you fall asleep, you fall asleep.

05:58.991 --> 06:01.323
One rule. No physical violence.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.292
I mean, you might get angry with someone...

06:04.364 --> 06:06.889
so please don't clobber him or her.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.734
Okay? That's the only restriction.

06:11.704 --> 06:15.606
We talk a lot about love
but we don't feel it a lot.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.740
So perhaps this Marathon
will open up some doors.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.510
So let's begin by just
introducing ourselves...

06:24.584 --> 06:27.280
and stating, briefly, why you are here.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.417
My name's Conrad...

06:31.758 --> 06:33.316
and I'm here...

06:36.229 --> 06:40.666
because I'm 64 years old,
and I want to continue to grow...

06:41.601 --> 06:43.228
as a human being.

06:44.036 --> 06:47.062
I don't know why I came here. I really don't.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.303
- Why do you feel you came here?
- I just said, I don't know.

06:50.376 --> 06:54.210
- Yeah, but why do you feel you don't know?
- Maybe I'm a little nervous.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.679
We all are.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.812
- Thank you.
- Okay, we'll get back to you later, Toby.

06:59.886 --> 07:02.753
I guess I came here
because I'm having trouble with men.

07:02.822 --> 07:06.656
- We'll get back to you later.
- But I can't say no to any man.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.892
I'm Myrna.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.766
I came because I want a better orgasm.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.761
It's just not good enough.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.138
I'm Bob and I'm here because...

07:25.812 --> 07:29.270
I'm a documentary filmmaker...

07:29.549 --> 07:33.212
and I'm here to do research
on a piece I want to do on the Institute.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.948
At least, I think that's why I'm here.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.022
I'm Carol.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.955
I'm Bob's wife...

07:44.564 --> 07:46.896
and I came because Bob came.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.226
A hundred times a day...

07:51.304 --> 07:54.273
you just walk by people
you know. You chat...

07:54.607 --> 07:58.099
you nod hello,
but you don't really look at each other.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.545
I want you to look at each other.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.414
That's good. See the other person.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.782
Good. Say hello with your eyes.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.154
Try and make contact.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.990
See the other person there.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.032
Really, really look.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.266
Just look.

08:24.537 --> 08:28.029
And give. And don't be afraid
to express what you feel.

08:28.341 --> 08:32.072
Show the other person what you feel.
Show them who you are.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.282
Give of yourself. Don't be afraid.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.950
And really try to make contact.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.350
Really try to see.

08:47.393 --> 08:51.352
That's good. Now show him what you feel.
Go ahead.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.063
Really try.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.895
And learn something
about the other person...

08:57.970 --> 08:59.995
good, by just looking...

09:01.440 --> 09:03.374
and giving of yourself.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.707
Just look and give.

09:06.979 --> 09:10.380
Try to really learn something
about the other person.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.045
Open up.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.312
That's good! Show them what you feel.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.651
Don't be afraid to have fun.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.554
Good.

09:22.828 --> 09:26.161
Pound with those hands!
Think of something you don't like.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.563
Good!

09:28.901 --> 09:31.802
Pound! That's good.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.304
Pick something you don't like.

09:33.372 --> 09:36.466
Scream if you feel like it. Scream! Let it out!

09:37.009 --> 09:39.807
Pound hard. Good.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.247
Go ahead, scream. Let it out.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.411
Scream! Scream louder.

09:47.486 --> 09:50.944
I want to see ugly faces. Ugly faces.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.412
Open up.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.284
Let it out. Go ahead, cry. Good.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.279
Go ahead. Beautiful.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.560
It's all right.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.922
I just don't know why...

10:34.634 --> 10:37.728
I've never been able
to do anything for myself.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.804
I think...

10:41.073 --> 10:44.099
the reason that you feel
so helpless, Roger...

10:45.077 --> 10:47.875
- is because you enjoy it.
- Carol...

10:48.147 --> 10:52.413
don't tell Roger what you think,
tell him how you feel about him.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.718
I feel...

10:56.856 --> 10:58.380
sorry for him.

10:58.858 --> 11:00.291
Thank you.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.791
She wants to mother him.
She loves being a mother.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.028
Not necessarily, Bob.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.096
No, come on, honey.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.569
Bob, you feel like
getting into Carol's circle?

11:12.638 --> 11:16.904
- No, I'm sorry. I was just commenting.
- You're dying to get in there.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.374
Yeah, right, okay. Be delighted.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.947
You can take my place.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.886
- Thank you, Conrad.
- You're welcome, Bob.

11:33.793 --> 11:37.126
I feel very badly about Conrad
leaving my circle.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.164
You're pretty hostile.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.803
I feel very badly about Conrad
leaving my circle.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.801
- You want me to leave?
- How do you feel about Myrna, Bob?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.466
I feel she's hostile.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.704
Probably has to do
with wanting a better orgasm.

11:52.778 --> 11:55.110
- You're full of crap, man.
- You're copping out.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.509
- You're a hostile bitch!
- Is that how you feel?

12:00.619 --> 12:01.779
Is it?

12:04.523 --> 12:06.491
Yeah, I feel hostile.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.960
Good, now you're dealing with
your feelings, you see.

12:10.663 --> 12:14.292
- I feel you're all attacking my husband.
- Thank you, dear.

12:15.334 --> 12:18.497
That won't do here.
What do you feel about me?

12:20.106 --> 12:21.698
I feel sorry for you.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.873
I feel...

13:03.582 --> 13:05.209
that you don't...

13:06.085 --> 13:07.279
share.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.480
I want you to look at me.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.522
Please.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.530
You're pushing me again!

13:19.098 --> 13:21.931
- You're making me do something.
- I'm sorry.

13:30.576 --> 13:33.773
Bob, I want you to express
how you feel right now.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.116
I feel guilty. I feel confused.

13:39.518 --> 13:40.849
Then express it.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.753
I feel I want Carol...

13:44.023 --> 13:46.457
to open to me more...

13:48.894 --> 13:50.885
but that I close her up...

13:51.931 --> 13:54.866
if I force her to open.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.867
I'm sorry.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.904
I hide my feelings,
and I accuse you of hiding yours.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.345
I do hide my feelings.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.450
I'm afraid of you.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.434
Bob, tell Carol how you feel right now.
Tell her right now.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.408
I love her.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.744
I love you.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.841
I know.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.896
I want you to help me.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.729
As long as I've known you...

15:05.471 --> 15:08.463
I've always been afraid to ask for your help.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.471
I didn't know.

15:24.723 --> 15:25.951
Help me.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.186
He was so angry all the time.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.992
Really hostile. Remember the little guy?

15:33.065 --> 15:35.465
This man sat there for 20 hours...

15:36.035 --> 15:37.866
hardly saying a word.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.901
Pathetic little 40-year-old...

15:41.573 --> 15:43.598
Jimmy Cagney type of guy.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.276
All of a sudden he starts to cry.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.038
"I'm impotent."

15:49.848 --> 15:51.213
Forty years...

15:52.851 --> 15:54.751
of his terrible secret.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.648
Something broken.
Poor kid couldn't stop crying.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.487
- I feel moved now just talking about it.
- It was beautiful.

16:00.559 --> 16:05.019
And he was not miraculously cured.
Because it doesn't work that way.

16:05.097 --> 16:09.591
But just being able to say it out,
to a roomful of relatively unknown people...

16:09.668 --> 16:13.468
has got to be a way,
a beginning, to dealing with it.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.098
I must say something now.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.376
Which if I did not say it...

16:18.444 --> 16:20.742
I would be playing games with myself,
with us.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.872
What was that look before?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.747
- What look?
- You know.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.451
- The one to Alice, just before.
- You mean that look?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.613
- I didn't see the look.
- It was a put-down look.

16:30.689 --> 16:31.986
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.617
- That wasn't a put-down look.
- No, it's okay if it was.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.856
- It wasn't a put-down look.
- It's okay if it was, that's my whole...

16:37.930 --> 16:40.899
- It wasn't a put-down look!
- No, that's my whole point.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.434
If you just get it out, just deal with it...

16:43.502 --> 16:45.936
or deal with me,
or with Carol, or with Alice...

16:46.005 --> 16:50.169
- It was what it was. I dealt with Alice.
- But you didn't deal with Bob.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.040
Come on, you didn't even see the look.

16:53.112 --> 16:57.139
Come on, Alice. I know that look.
Bob and I do it all the time.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.945
No "Oh, ho ho."

17:00.853 --> 17:02.787
That's what we used to do.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.585
That's what we are trying
not to do ever again.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.057
Ever. To the people that we love.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.491
- And we love you.
- We know. I know that.

17:11.563 --> 17:14.224
We really do, you know.
We really do love you.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.529
And we really do love you!

17:16.935 --> 17:18.561
We love you, too.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.473
But we are not always
totally honest with each other.

17:28.547 --> 17:33.109
- Yes, we are! I have never lied to you.
- Alice, do you like my outfit?

17:34.787 --> 17:35.981
I love it.

17:36.055 --> 17:40.355
They don't want to know what you think,
they want to know what you feel.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.757
I feel...

17:42.995 --> 17:47.056
that your outfit is an important contribution
to an otherwise dull society.

17:47.132 --> 17:50.192
No, Ted, don't do that. Don't do that, please.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.867
How can you feel about a dress?
It's not that important.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.407
It's the most important thing
in the world, this dress.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.102
If you don't care about this dress...

17:58.177 --> 18:00.270
you're on the way
to not caring about humanity.

18:00.345 --> 18:03.041
- That's patently absurd.
- It's not <i>...</i>

18:07.786 --> 18:09.879
What do you feel about...

18:11.056 --> 18:13.047
- my hair?
- Your hair?

18:16.795 --> 18:17.989
I don't want to offend you...

18:18.063 --> 18:21.294
but the majority of my day isn't spent
in ruminating about your hair.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.891
- Be honest.
- Your hair looks very good on you.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.994
- You're full of crap.
- Cop out.

18:26.071 --> 18:29.598
- That's what we call a cop-out.
- Yeah. That's a cop-out.

18:29.741 --> 18:31.265
Can't you feel?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.969
How do you feel about it?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.913
Okay. I feel it's a little long.

18:37.716 --> 18:40.685
- That's beautiful.
- That's great. You're starting <i>...</i>

18:40.752 --> 18:44.518
He's starting to open up right away.
As soon as you begin to deal with things.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.388
What you really feel
is that my hair is ridiculously long...

18:47.459 --> 18:48.949
and that I'm a middle-aged guy...

18:49.027 --> 18:51.154
trying to look like
a young hippie or something.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.892
Okay. I think your hair looks ridiculous.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.763
- It's silly.
- That's gorgeous, man.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.600
- The truth is always beautiful.
- That's great.

18:59.671 --> 19:00.968
- That's good?
- That's beautiful.

19:01.039 --> 19:02.097
You like that?

19:02.174 --> 19:03.266
- It's beautiful.
- Marvelous.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.537
The truth is always beautiful.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.316
Here, give me your hand.
Put your hand up here. On top of hers.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.146
Here, give me your hand.
Put your hand up here. On top of hers.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.015
I feel very close to you now.

19:21.593 --> 19:25.324
I feel so moved, so full of love.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.865
Thank you.
And I hope everything was satisfactory.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.097
- Do you really, Emilio?
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Sanders?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.509
I mean, do you really hope and feel...

19:40.579 --> 19:44.208
that you wish the service was satisfactory?
Is that what you really feel?

19:44.283 --> 19:46.877
There was nothing wrong with the dinner?
My service?

19:46.952 --> 19:47.976
Honey.

19:48.053 --> 19:50.146
Darling, what am I doing?
No. Of course not.

19:50.222 --> 19:53.191
Your service was marvelous,
and the dinner was great.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.421
It's just that we were talking about
the fact that people...

19:56.495 --> 19:58.258
very seldom talk to each other.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.527
I mean, I have been coming in here
for a long time...

20:01.600 --> 20:05.229
and I have never really talked to you.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.973
- Was it the wine?
- What do you expect that poor man to do?

20:09.041 --> 20:13.273
Now really, he does not know
that your life changed over the weekend.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.713
Emilio, people find it very hard...

20:18.350 --> 20:20.545
to tell each other the truth.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.217
- Will there be anything else?
- No. Thanks, Emilio.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.683
It's beautiful. Thank you.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.228
It must have been some incredible weekend.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.031
Excuse <i>moi.</i>

20:50.315 --> 20:52.909
Emilio, I'm sorry.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.350
- I've made you feel uncomfortable.
- That's all right, Mrs. Sanders.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.446
No. It's not all right.

20:58.523 --> 21:01.390
Nobody should ever make anybody
feel uncomfortable.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.121
You're a nice man.

21:13.505 --> 21:14.802
Well, honey.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.608
Listen, I got an early morning.

21:20.912 --> 21:24.871
I feel I have to say something first,
before we go. I really do.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.383
- What?
- What?

21:29.855 --> 21:33.052
This could very well bug you, Bob,
but I feel I have to say it.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.856
- Ted, what do you want to say?
- Alice, I feel I have to say this!

21:36.928 --> 21:38.020
Go.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.460
I feel you should pay for the check.

21:46.104 --> 21:49.631
I really felt that.
I really feel you should pay for it.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.351
Thanks.

22:21.940 --> 22:22.929
Gosh.

22:23.775 --> 22:24.799
Hi.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.644
- I missed you.
- And I missed you.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.746
- Martini on the plane?
- Yeah, two, as a matter of fact.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.154
Shall we have it here on the stairs
or wait till I unpack?

22:44.229 --> 22:45.526
Stairs.

22:50.068 --> 22:53.731
- How did the shooting go?
- It went well, very well indeed.

22:54.106 --> 22:58.839
Got some great footage.
The cameraman is <i>...</i> I don't know.

22:58.910 --> 23:02.209
This new guy's something else.
He's got some kind of juice going.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.511
I don't really understand.
He's very involved with the material.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.643
You know, a cameraman! And he's involved!

23:07.719 --> 23:11.416
And no hostility, no envy.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.056
He's got something going for him
that I wish I had.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.923
You're getting there.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.863
- Nutty.
- What did you buy me, Daddy?

23:24.936 --> 23:28.770
"What did I buy you?"
Is that all I ever get when you come home?

23:29.741 --> 23:31.504
That's what you get!

23:31.843 --> 23:34.869
I got you something,
but you don't get it till tomorrow morning.

23:34.946 --> 23:36.504
- Come on.
- Turn loose.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.175
- Come on, darling.
- Turn loose. I need my whistle!

23:39.251 --> 23:42.687
- I want to see it now!
- You can see it in the morning.

23:52.464 --> 23:53.829
A tiger!

23:55.000 --> 23:58.401
Darling, look at your nice toy
that Daddy got you.

23:58.470 --> 24:02.907
It can bite your nose right off.
You can make it bite off an entire nose!

24:03.108 --> 24:04.507
Put your hand up. Okay.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.942
- Come on, you ready to do our number?
- Go to bed.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.147
Nightie-night.

24:14.786 --> 24:18.415
Now, you ready? There. Okay.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.890
Underneath. Go on, get underneath.

24:21.026 --> 24:24.291
Come on. Underneath. Deep down.

24:26.064 --> 24:27.361
<i>Sayonara.</i>

24:31.203 --> 24:33.228
I have a tiger in my eye!

24:33.305 --> 24:36.433
Get out of my eye, tiger.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.908
That tiger, it keeps going
in my eye all the time.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.478
What did you do in San Francisco?

24:47.219 --> 24:48.777
I made a movie.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.348
Will it be on TV?

24:52.290 --> 24:56.693
Yeah, honey, it's going to be on TV,
but it'll be a while before it's on.

24:57.128 --> 24:58.755
I want to watch it now.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.924
You can't watch it now,
because it's not ready yet to be watched.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.467
When will it be finished?

25:03.535 --> 25:06.265
Like always,
I have to take it to the cutting room first...

25:06.338 --> 25:09.000
and put the different pieces together.

25:11.409 --> 25:14.537
I'll whistle for you.
One whistle, and right to sleep.

25:15.213 --> 25:17.545
Okay, that's all. Good night, son.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.520
Tell tiger a story.

25:25.957 --> 25:30.053
- No stories now. Go to sleep.
- Hug.

25:36.334 --> 25:37.961
That's beautiful.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.863
- Go to sleep.
- Nightie-night.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.471
Leave the door open.

26:06.464 --> 26:08.022
He can whistle.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.565
You're probably tired.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.370
I had an affair in San Francisco.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.338
It just happened, and I owe it...

27:26.544 --> 27:29.377
to you, and to us, to say so.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.340
It was last night. When we finished up...

27:33.418 --> 27:37.047
the soundman had brought this girl
as an assistant.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.625
Blond, nice.

27:42.761 --> 27:45.525
Of course, she asked for a ride home...

27:47.666 --> 27:50.760
and we wound up in my hotel room...

27:53.004 --> 27:54.631
and we made <i>...</i>

27:59.477 --> 28:02.537
Affair is the wrong word.
We had intercourse.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.510
That's what we had.

28:08.953 --> 28:10.011
Well?

28:10.722 --> 28:13.816
I'm not sure how I feel.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.959
Now let me see.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.988
How do I feel right this minute?

28:25.937 --> 28:28.462
I feel <i>...</i>

28:30.608 --> 28:33.736
I don't feel upset. I really don't.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.282
I don't feel surprised.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.485
I feel strange.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.519
- I don't feel jealous.
- You must feel jealous.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.121
Maybe I'm kidding myself.

28:54.199 --> 28:57.726
I mean, maybe I'm hiding something
from myself.

28:58.036 --> 29:01.233
- That's it, you're hiding.
- Let me hear it again.

29:03.074 --> 29:06.134
Now what happened
when you were in San Francisco?

29:06.211 --> 29:09.305
Come on, honey!
I made it with another chick.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.541
- Are you in love with her?
- No, of course not.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.813
- It was a purely physical thing?
- Yes, absolutely!

29:15.019 --> 29:18.420
Darling, I don't see how I can feel jealous...

29:18.490 --> 29:21.926
about a purely physical thing
you had with some dumb blond.

29:21.993 --> 29:25.724
Now wait a minute. Not dumb.
She just got her master's at Berkeley.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.622
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.290
- How old is she?
- Twenty.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.933
That's the same age as my kid sister.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.499
- You are hostile.
- Darling, I'm not!

29:39.944 --> 29:44.244
No, I was thinking how close Amy is
to being a woman, that's all.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.977
- You're playing games with me.
- I'm not!

29:47.051 --> 29:49.281
Yeah, you are. Playing games.

29:50.054 --> 29:51.385
Playing the emancipated woman...

29:51.456 --> 29:53.720
a hip chick that doesn't care
what her husband does.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.158
I care very much what you do!

29:56.227 --> 29:58.092
You don't care what I do, that's obvious.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.996
Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting there
on top of a volcano...

30:01.065 --> 30:03.329
that wants to spew out of you,
and you won't let it.

30:03.401 --> 30:06.268
You know what you're doing?
Trying to make me react again.

30:06.337 --> 30:09.101
You feel guilty,
and you're trying to make me punish you.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.734
I did a terrible thing. I cheated!

30:11.810 --> 30:16.144
My darling, you did not do a terrible thing.
You told me about it.

30:16.214 --> 30:19.115
If you hadn't have told me,
then that would have been cheating.

30:19.184 --> 30:20.242
I know what cheating is.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.879
Cheating is when you ball a chick
that's not your wife. That's cheating!

30:34.766 --> 30:36.165
I feel...

30:37.035 --> 30:40.300
closer to you
than I've ever felt in my whole life.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.430
I feel that...

30:44.142 --> 30:47.942
you're sharing something so personal.

30:50.882 --> 30:54.283
I feel very moved that you trust me.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.593
You didn't do anything wrong.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.557
You're an attractive, beautiful man.

31:11.169 --> 31:14.935
And you love your wife,
and you love your child.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.798
Honey, you didn't do anything wrong.

31:21.079 --> 31:22.637
And I love you.

31:29.287 --> 31:30.982
What was she like?

31:32.357 --> 31:34.450
- The girl.
- Very nice.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.691
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

31:39.063 --> 31:43.523
- She looked a little like Candy Bergen.
- Too bad she didn't look like Edgar Bergen.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.262
You are jealous!

31:45.737 --> 31:47.170
I'm joking.

31:47.238 --> 31:51.231
I'm just making a joke.
Can't I be curious without being jealous?

31:53.211 --> 31:55.543
Carol, we had sex, that's all.

31:55.713 --> 31:58.204
Who made the first move?

31:58.416 --> 32:01.647
- You know, when you <i>...</i>
- Show me.

32:03.521 --> 32:06.354
- Come on.
- Come on.

32:10.228 --> 32:12.628
Tell me what happened after that.

32:13.531 --> 32:16.227
We wound up in my hotel room...

32:17.902 --> 32:20.200
and then we started fooling around.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.068
Did you undress her?

32:22.407 --> 32:25.342
I don't remember
whether I undressed her or not.

32:25.410 --> 32:26.900
You remember.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.343
Yeah, I undressed her.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.048
Kissing?

32:36.988 --> 32:38.319
Yeah.

32:42.226 --> 32:43.386
Good?

32:45.596 --> 32:47.291
Yeah.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.692
As good as me?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.201
- No, you're better.
- How much?

32:59.844 --> 33:01.038
A lot.

33:04.015 --> 33:05.277
Grade me.

33:08.686 --> 33:10.711
Better. A lot better.

33:17.962 --> 33:21.523
Bob, I know one thing,
if I know nothing else in the world...

33:21.599 --> 33:23.533
it's a beautiful world!

33:26.504 --> 33:29.098
Carol, good night. Thank you.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.733
- Good night.
- I love you.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.470
I love you, too.

33:37.215 --> 33:40.150
The gazpacho was astonishing.
Great meal, Carol.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.788
You know, I love the Strickners,
and the Hammers...

33:44.856 --> 33:48.519
but whenever they start to leave,
it's like a movie with 10 false endings.

33:48.593 --> 33:51.960
- Sue's little boy is seeing a therapist.
- I didn't know that.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.522
- Don't mention it.
- Why? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.363
I agree, but it's nothing I'd like to...

33:57.435 --> 33:59.995
- What's his problem?
- He runs away from school.

34:00.071 --> 34:02.869
- How old is he?
- Five and a half.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.932
- I hated kindergarten.
- Where does he run to?

34:06.010 --> 34:09.844
They live across the street from the school,
and he runs home.

34:12.116 --> 34:15.279
It's great stuff.
I'm warning you now, get ready.

34:21.359 --> 34:22.485
True, true.

34:33.271 --> 34:36.831
- Hold on to it, my man.
- Is this Acapulco gold?

34:36.908 --> 34:39.274
No. This is beautiful,
downtown Burbank brown.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.208
It's very heavy stuff.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.188
It's strong.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.001
That thing just burns.
I don't know how you can...

35:06.070 --> 35:09.801
- You just gotta let it happen, honey.
- I never get high.

35:17.782 --> 35:21.309
- My ears are beginning to get warm.
- I never get high.

35:21.652 --> 35:24.951
I am totally and completely
zonked out of my skull.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.451
Did you see Norma's lipstick?

35:27.525 --> 35:30.824
I mean, a little too much lipstick
is one thing...

35:30.895 --> 35:34.558
- but when it's up to there.
- That's very hostile, my dear.

35:34.665 --> 35:37.862
Listen, just remind me,
and I'll send you a demo.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.596
I'll send you a groovy, peaceful demo.

35:42.874 --> 35:46.901
And I'll wrap it in my Nehru jacket
and my peaceful beads.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.480
And then I will groovily and peacefully...

35:50.548 --> 35:55.417
drive your 18-year-old babysitter home
and groove her a peaceful, groovy baby.

36:02.727 --> 36:06.094
The gazpacho was astonishing...

36:06.164 --> 36:08.724
absolutely astonishing.

36:14.038 --> 36:15.369
Astonishing.

36:15.439 --> 36:18.272
- It is astonishing.
- Astonishing.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.618
You have a case tomorrow, adorable one.

36:27.685 --> 36:28.652
You are too much...

36:28.719 --> 36:33.088
my sweet, unstoned mother of my only son,
who I love...

36:33.524 --> 36:35.116
you're too much.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.589
I never get high
doesn't matter how much I try.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.497
Honey, you know what I think it is?

37:51.569 --> 37:54.868
I really think the reason
I'm afraid is because...

37:55.273 --> 37:58.401
you are an attorney
and we could get into a potful of trouble.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.875
Potful, pot.

38:01.045 --> 38:02.410
No, really.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.645
I love you anyway.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.202
Sweetheart, I told you about this phobia.

38:25.202 --> 38:27.397
Sweetheart, I told you about this phobia.

38:33.511 --> 38:36.036
You both look so beautiful.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.550
- You really do.
- How about me?

38:43.621 --> 38:47.113
- You look very, very beautiful.
- I hope so.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.258
I sense...

38:52.296 --> 38:55.663
marital... passion.

38:56.033 --> 38:59.560
- You sense well.
- You gonna play tennis tomorrow?

39:00.671 --> 39:02.764
- I reserved a court.
- Tomorrow?

39:02.840 --> 39:05.138
Junkie, come on, let's go home.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.534
Come on, darling.

39:39.443 --> 39:42.674
- See you.
- The gazpacho was gorgeous. Astonishing.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.563
I love you so much.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.298
I really love you.

40:09.306 --> 40:12.298
I want to share something beautiful
with you.

40:13.110 --> 40:16.170
Bob had an affair
when he was in San Francisco.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.108
It wasn't an affair. It was just sex.

40:19.817 --> 40:22.149
But he told me all about it...

40:23.721 --> 40:27.316
and I had to share it with you,
'cause it's so beautiful.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.287
I really love you.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.355
I love you.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.257
See you tomorrow for tennis.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.903
I have such hostility for Bob
I cannot tell you.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.841
I thought she was gonna
tell us she was pregnant or something.

40:46.911 --> 40:49.471
How could she tell us?

40:49.547 --> 40:53.074
"I have great news for you.
Bob just had an affair." Wow.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.317
Ted, I think I'm gonna be sick.

41:03.661 --> 41:04.787
Here.

41:05.362 --> 41:09.230
- I have to have water for that.
- Look, we'll be home in a couple of minutes.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.234
I am going to throw up!

41:11.735 --> 41:13.225
Relax.

41:21.712 --> 41:23.179
<i>Your order please.</i>

41:23.247 --> 41:25.841
- A glass of water, please.
- How can I face her tomorrow?

41:25.916 --> 41:27.315
We're supposed to play tennis?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.818
<i>- Did you read the menu?</i>
- Just a glass of water.

41:29.887 --> 41:33.983
<i>- What else would you like?</i>
- No. Look, all I want is a glass of water.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.959
<i>We have tacos, enchiladas,</i>
<i>chili rellenos, cheeseburgers...</i>

41:37.027 --> 41:40.258
<i>bonus burgers, hot dogs,</i>
<i>potato chips, barbeque chips.</i>

41:40.331 --> 41:41.628
I'm gonna to throw up.

41:41.699 --> 41:45.328
Look, let me have a taco
and a large glass of water.

41:45.402 --> 41:46.391
<i>Anything else to drink?</i>

41:46.470 --> 41:49.200
No, I just want a glass of water!
Don't you understand that?

41:49.273 --> 41:52.071
I'm not hungry.
All I want to do is get you a glass of water.

41:52.142 --> 41:53.234
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

41:59.183 --> 42:02.778
Oh, my God. I'm sick. I really am. I'm sick.

42:04.655 --> 42:06.987
Absolutely sick from this thing.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.456
How could she tell us, Ted?
How she just came <i>...</i>

42:13.364 --> 42:16.094
I have such hostility for Bob
I cannot tell you.

42:16.166 --> 42:18.225
I feel sorry for both of them.

42:18.302 --> 42:21.499
I feel sorry for her.
How could she live with him?

42:23.173 --> 42:26.438
- Honey, please don't do that now.
- I'm almost finished.

42:26.510 --> 42:29.138
I have a headache,
and you are shaking the whole house.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.306
- What are you at now?
- 810.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.873
My head won't take 500 more.
Now will you stop it?

42:33.951 --> 42:35.077
- Let me go to nine.
- Please.

42:35.152 --> 42:37.780
- Let me go to nine.
- Will you stop it?

42:42.826 --> 42:44.418
Okay, I'm sorry.

42:53.137 --> 42:55.867
I had the same feeling when Mother died.

43:03.781 --> 43:05.681
I don't want to see them anymore.

43:05.749 --> 43:09.048
- You don't want to see Carol?
- How am I going to face her?

43:09.119 --> 43:11.178
What, we're supposed to play tennis?

43:11.255 --> 43:14.452
I can understand you
being uncomfortable with Bob.

43:14.525 --> 43:17.517
She just came right out and told us.

43:18.228 --> 43:20.958
- We have to help them.
- How are we going to help?

43:21.031 --> 43:25.593
- I don't know yet, but we <i>...</i>
- Yeah, you will have to help your friend Bob.

43:33.377 --> 43:37.814
Look, hopefully it happened and it's over,
and that's all there is to it.

43:38.349 --> 43:41.045
- You know what I think it all is?
- What?

43:41.118 --> 43:43.882
Instead of her saying
that Bob had an affair...

43:43.954 --> 43:46.923
and he told me, and I'm leaving him,
which is what she feels...

43:46.991 --> 43:49.789
- Absolutely.
...she's covering it all up.

43:49.994 --> 43:54.055
Now why Bob did it is another story.
I don't know why he told her.

43:55.232 --> 43:57.723
He's probably very guilty, you know?

43:58.002 --> 44:02.268
And in the spirit of this
whole confrontation thing, he told her.

44:02.773 --> 44:05.765
It's not the most intelligent thing to do.

44:07.044 --> 44:09.069
I wish he'd told me first.

44:10.047 --> 44:12.982
He didn't tell you?
You didn't know anything about it at all?

44:13.050 --> 44:15.541
No. I was as surprised as you were.

44:17.354 --> 44:21.484
Do you know that you've not said one thing
about what Bob has done?

44:22.693 --> 44:25.594
He's done a terrible thing. I agree with you.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.689
He's asking for trouble.
But he wants trouble.

44:28.799 --> 44:32.235
Alice, there must be 50 million men
having an affair right this second...

44:32.302 --> 44:34.702
and not one of them is going to go
and tell his wife.

44:34.772 --> 44:38.367
- And Bob has to go and tell Carol.
- The point is not that he told her.

44:38.442 --> 44:40.069
The point is that he did it.

44:40.144 --> 44:43.045
That he cheated on his wife.
That he cheated on Carol.

44:43.113 --> 44:46.571
I agree. That's bad.
But I think you'll agree with me...

44:46.650 --> 44:48.880
that if he hadn't told her
there'd be no problem.

44:48.952 --> 44:51.978
There'd be no problem
if he hadn't done it, if he hadn't cheated!

44:52.056 --> 44:55.082
All I'm trying to say is that
if we're examining the dumbness...

44:55.159 --> 44:58.424
it was dumb of him to tell her.
The other thing was just physical.

44:58.495 --> 45:01.191
Look, if he needs it that badly,
let him go and get it.

45:01.265 --> 45:03.529
Let him go and get it. I don't know.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.330
Look, thank heavens it's not my problem.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.035
I am very pleased about that.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.306
- Come on.
- No, I really am.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.710
- It gives me a great feeling of security.
- Come on!

45:16.780 --> 45:18.577
It's something I know you'd never do.

45:18.649 --> 45:21.618
- Don't say it even.
- Nothing could make you do that.

45:21.685 --> 45:23.312
Good night, dear.

45:28.092 --> 45:30.219
I'm turned on enough by you.

45:30.961 --> 45:33.088
I don't need anything else.

45:35.232 --> 45:38.668
- Honey, please don't do that now.
- Come on, Alice.

45:38.736 --> 45:41.830
Baby, I'm just not in the mood at all. Okay?

45:51.014 --> 45:53.448
You want to watch some television?

45:54.585 --> 45:58.316
- Would it bother you if I watched some?
- No, honey, you can watch it.

45:58.388 --> 46:00.049
Keep it low, okay?

46:11.735 --> 46:14.704
You want me to give you a massage?
Let me give you a massage.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.400
- Honey, I don't...
- I'll give you a massage.

46:17.474 --> 46:20.034
I just wish you wouldn't
touch me now, that's all.

46:20.110 --> 46:22.010
All right.

46:22.346 --> 46:25.179
Can you understand what happened?

46:25.249 --> 46:29.481
- It just turns me off completely.
- You don't mind if I sleep here?

46:30.821 --> 46:32.550
Now don't be silly.

46:36.260 --> 46:39.024
I understand, Alice. I understand.

46:41.064 --> 46:42.531
I think I'll take a walk.

46:42.599 --> 46:46.330
Honey, no, don't.
Please, Ted, don't go for a walk.

46:46.837 --> 46:48.600
I feel so nervous.

46:50.240 --> 46:54.233
I have this energy in me, Alice, this excess...

46:54.311 --> 46:56.643
Why don't you do your exercises?

46:58.782 --> 47:01.307
- I'll take a walk.
- No, please. I don't want you <i>...</i>

47:01.385 --> 47:02.852
Please don't walk.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.410
- You want me to stay?
- Please stay.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.353
Will you stay, please?

47:07.691 --> 47:10.285
- I'll just stay up.
- Thank you.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.419
I know, hon.

47:13.530 --> 47:16.124
- Okay, honey?
- Yeah.

47:18.368 --> 47:20.393
- Okay, honey.
- Go to sleep.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.145
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Alice.

47:55.906 --> 47:58.602
- Come on, Alice, please.
- Honey, I asked you not to.

47:59.343 --> 48:01.174
Will you please stop?

48:01.778 --> 48:03.109
Will you just stop it!

48:03.180 --> 48:05.910
- I'm taking a walk.
- What? Don't walk, just stay!

48:05.983 --> 48:09.817
- Make up your mind, will you?
- Is that the only option I have?

48:10.153 --> 48:13.680
I'm still high
and I'm stimulated and aroused.

48:13.757 --> 48:15.190
Don't take it out on me.

48:16.326 --> 48:19.625
Ted, do you want me
to do something against my will?

48:25.235 --> 48:26.224
Do you?

48:26.303 --> 48:29.363
Do you want me to do something
against my will? Do you?

48:32.142 --> 48:34.633
No, I don't want you to do
anything against your will.

48:34.711 --> 48:37.544
All right, but please
don't take a walk. Okay?

49:02.439 --> 49:05.101
Were you in the mood
before you found out?

49:06.543 --> 49:08.807
'Cause I was in the mood then.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.142
Before when, you know,
when we were in the car...

49:12.215 --> 49:16.481
- were you in the mood then?
- Yeah, I thought we'd come home...

49:16.553 --> 49:19.181
'Cause I was really <i>...</i>

49:20.624 --> 49:24.151
I really was in the mood. I really, really <i>...</i>

49:26.263 --> 49:29.357
Why don't we just forget
about what she told us?

49:34.638 --> 49:36.071
- I know...
- Just...

49:36.139 --> 49:39.939
I know, now,
I know that you are in the mood.

49:40.510 --> 49:42.705
But honey, I'm not. Now, look.

49:46.283 --> 49:49.912
Now do you want to do it
just like that, with no feeling on my part?

49:49.987 --> 49:51.079
Yeah.

50:09.506 --> 50:11.303
Go ahead, do what you want.

50:17.581 --> 50:19.947
- Come on, Alice.
- Do what you have to do.

50:20.017 --> 50:22.679
- I'm going to watch television.
- Here!

50:22.753 --> 50:26.348
- Alice, you're making it very cheap!
- You pick an incredible time!

50:33.930 --> 50:36.694
Maybe it is an incredible time, Alice.

50:37.367 --> 50:39.892
I don't know, Alice. I just can't seem to...

50:40.737 --> 50:43.934
- control my drives.
- Honey, I'm sorry. I really am.

50:44.641 --> 50:48.577
- I'm so upset about Carol.
- I'm upset for both of them, Alice.

50:49.079 --> 50:51.707
But I'm getting more upset for myself.

50:52.049 --> 50:56.008
I don't know, I'm beginning to become a <i>...</i>
Never mind.

50:57.287 --> 50:58.879
What do you mean? What are you...

50:58.955 --> 51:00.650
I have a headache.

51:00.724 --> 51:03.955
There's this incredible band
around my head, Alice.

51:04.494 --> 51:07.292
What can I do? What do you want me to do?

51:07.364 --> 51:08.490
Alice, just...

51:08.565 --> 51:10.556
- What can I do?
- Rub the back of my neck.

51:10.634 --> 51:13.535
- Right here?
- I have this incredible knot.

51:13.603 --> 51:15.002
Is it right there?

51:15.806 --> 51:19.173
Is that good? You poor baby.

51:19.776 --> 51:22.836
You were affected by this thing, too.
You're all tense.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.408
- There?
- Yeah.

51:26.917 --> 51:30.216
- Is that better?
- Yes. It's better.

51:30.287 --> 51:31.379
Okay?

51:32.189 --> 51:34.851
- All over. Is that good?
- That feels perfect.

51:38.728 --> 51:41.959
- I wonder if they'll get a divorce?
- I doubt it.

51:42.866 --> 51:45.198
The thing that annoys me
more than anything else...

51:45.268 --> 51:47.668
- is that she's back at that...
- Did you take your pill?

51:47.737 --> 51:50.501
No, I'll take it later.
Why do you think she told us?

51:50.574 --> 51:52.337
She just came right out and told us.

51:52.409 --> 51:54.274
- I'm very excited.
- I don't...

51:54.344 --> 51:56.539
- I don't feel that way!
- I'm gonna take a walk.

51:56.613 --> 52:00.606
- No, I don't wanna be left alone.
- I wish I had a dog. I'd take him for a walk.

52:00.684 --> 52:04.313
- Let me take a walk, Alice!
- Go do whatever you want.

52:04.387 --> 52:07.049
I don't really care what you do. Go <i>...</i>

52:18.468 --> 52:20.766
Get the pills from the dresser.

52:22.672 --> 52:25.402
Get the pills from the dresser.

52:36.853 --> 52:38.013
Are you sure?

52:38.088 --> 52:41.057
I wouldn't want you to do
anything against your will.

52:43.393 --> 52:44.655
Get them.

53:05.649 --> 53:07.344
What's the matter?

53:09.719 --> 53:11.846
What's so funny?

53:13.657 --> 53:15.887
- Alice, what's the matter?
- I'm out.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.594
- What do you mean?
- I've no more pills.

53:19.663 --> 53:24.396
- What do you mean, you have no more pills?
- Honey, I'm sorry. I forgot to reorder.

53:24.467 --> 53:28.198
- You forgot to <i>...</i> How could you forget?
- Honey, I don't know, I forgot.

53:28.271 --> 53:29.829
- You...
- I forgot.

53:29.906 --> 53:33.967
That's the cruelest thing I've ever <i>...</i>
You forgot? You don't forget.

53:35.111 --> 53:39.104
- Honey, I forgot to reorder...
- Okay, right, fine. It's just as well.

53:39.182 --> 53:43.585
I understand. You know, it's really <i>...</i>
I have a case tomorrow morning.

53:43.954 --> 53:45.581
- I really...
- Honey, now come on <i>...</i>

53:45.655 --> 53:47.088
No, it's quite <i>...</i>

53:47.157 --> 53:51.924
- It's quite <i>...</i> No, Alice.
- No, what? Sweetie, I didn't do it purposely.

53:51.995 --> 53:56.329
I understand the problems that you have,
and it's just as well that <i>...</i>

53:56.866 --> 53:58.493
- Baby.
- No, please, don't touch me.

53:58.602 --> 54:01.127
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

54:01.871 --> 54:05.170
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

54:05.475 --> 54:09.605
<i>Happy birthday, dear Sean</i>

54:09.746 --> 54:13.910
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

54:17.220 --> 54:19.780
Now make a wish, darling. Make a wish.

54:19.856 --> 54:21.983
Make a secret wish. Wish to yourself.

54:22.058 --> 54:25.357
- Carol, you're in the way.
- I'm sorry, darling.

54:25.462 --> 54:28.295
- Blow out the candles.
- Don't tell him, let him do it himself.

54:28.365 --> 54:32.563
- I'm sorry, darling. Take a deep breath.
- I want to blow out, too.

54:32.636 --> 54:36.037
No, Christopher, it's not your birthday,
it's Sean's birthday.

54:36.106 --> 54:38.666
Let him blow, too. What's the big deal?

54:38.742 --> 54:41.677
Why are you countermanding
everything I say? You just <i>...</i>

54:41.745 --> 54:44.077
- I'm not countermanding...
- All right, you handle it.

54:44.147 --> 54:46.775
- He wants to blow.
- Take a big <i>...</i>

54:46.850 --> 54:49.785
Terrific! Good, big boy.

54:49.853 --> 54:51.582
Don't start in front of everybody.

54:51.655 --> 54:54.852
You mean, no one can hear us
because we're clenching our teeth?

54:54.924 --> 54:55.948
Maria.

55:07.003 --> 55:08.971
Bob thinks he's shooting
<i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

55:09.039 --> 55:11.803
- Is that a Bell and Howell?
- I don't know.

55:12.409 --> 55:15.173
Maybe it's a Japanese version. A Yashica.

55:19.082 --> 55:22.449
- Carol? Can I help you with that?
- No, thanks, that's all right.

55:22.519 --> 55:25.682
- The kids are really having a wonderful time.
- I know.

55:29.159 --> 55:32.788
- What was that about?
- Honey, you know I love you.

55:32.862 --> 55:34.295
I love you.

55:35.765 --> 55:40.327
You know, I've been afraid to talk to you?
I never know when you're serious.

55:42.639 --> 55:44.869
I want to open my presents.

55:44.941 --> 55:47.205
I'll be right there, darling.
Can you take these?

55:47.277 --> 55:50.178
Carol, I want you to know
I have been very upset.

55:52.916 --> 55:54.645
I didn't know that.

55:58.521 --> 56:01.251
- I'll be right back, all right?
- Okay.

56:02.459 --> 56:03.949
I'm sorry.

56:04.928 --> 56:06.190
Thank you.

56:19.576 --> 56:21.100
You went into the voting booth...

56:21.177 --> 56:24.044
I went in, and you understand,
I just stood there.

56:24.114 --> 56:27.015
I chose, at that moment
to have a personal moment.

56:27.083 --> 56:29.176
- You understand?
- But you didn't vote.

56:29.252 --> 56:32.813
I wanted something more out of the day
than my particular vote...

56:32.889 --> 56:35.653
could have afforded me, perhaps.
I wish you'd understand.

56:35.725 --> 56:38.387
- I told her how upset I was.
- Yeah? What did she say?

56:38.461 --> 56:40.395
- She was sorry.
- All right.

56:40.463 --> 56:43.489
- Coming in for a tight shot.
- What do you want us to do?

56:43.566 --> 56:47.297
You could rip her blouse off,
you know, I'd like to sell this thing.

56:48.838 --> 56:51.807
I don't know what to do.
I can' t rip her blouse off.

57:23.606 --> 57:24.664
Sorry.

57:24.741 --> 57:26.504
Wonder what that was about?

57:26.576 --> 57:29.136
Listen, we could do a tournament
with Chanel.

57:29.212 --> 57:32.010
- They expected a thousand people.
- Everybody showed up.

57:32.081 --> 57:33.241
Do we have a table?

57:33.316 --> 57:37.810
Yes. Phyllis Korwin's on the committee,
and she said she'd be holding a table for us.

58:14.390 --> 58:16.984
Drinks are $2, and here's $20 worth. Okay?

58:23.867 --> 58:25.266
See you later.

58:54.697 --> 58:57.029
Look, there's Sammy Davis, Jr.

58:57.100 --> 58:59.034
- Where?
- There's Alan Landsburg.

58:59.102 --> 59:01.502
- Who's Alan Landsburg?
- A friend of mine.

59:01.905 --> 59:03.099
Hi, Bob.

59:12.215 --> 59:15.116
- That's a pretty girl.
- Who is she?

59:15.184 --> 59:18.085
I know who she is. San Francisco.

59:21.858 --> 59:23.553
You have good taste.

59:35.505 --> 59:38.201
- I love you.
- I love you.

59:38.274 --> 59:40.799
- You're both sick.
- Alice.

59:40.877 --> 59:44.278
It's wrong! That's why <i>...</i>

59:55.391 --> 59:56.653
All sick.

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:11.404
I don't know what we were talking about.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:14.705
Difficulty having relationships
with your husband.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.472
Yes, that's right.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.374
Tell me about it.

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:26.983
- Yes, I don't feel like doing it. That's all.
- When did you stop enjoying it?

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:29.081
I just don't want to be touched.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:33.461
Several weeks ago.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:38.757
- I am a very happy person most of the time.
- What makes you a happy person?

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:41.565
What do you mean, what makes me happy?
I like my husband...

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:45.597
I love my child, and I love going places,
and I love our friends, and <i>...</i>

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:48.576
Yeah, I mean, I love my friends.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.011
I still love them.
I mean, I love them very much.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.983
It's just that they're just <i>...</i>
That's all on their minds, is sex. Sex.

01:00:56.052 --> 01:01:00.148
And sex, if it's on your mind all the time,
it can't be a very good thing, can it?

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:02.851
I mean, shouldn't it just happen?
It used to just happen.

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:05.359
Are you aware that, earlier, you said...

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:08.461
that you like your husband
and you love your child?

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:13.599
No, I don't remember saying that.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:16.794
No, I don't. I mean, I love my husband.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:20.001
- You do love him?
- Of course I love him!

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.178
Did I say that?

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:29.446
Yes. You said,
"I like my husband and I love my child."

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:39.455
"I like Ted."
Now that's just a figure of speech.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.430
I mean, that's how you say <i>...</i> Listen.

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.624
You know, I have a child.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:48.328
I have a wonderful <i>...</i>

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.730
My child...

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.409
wonderful, well-behaved.

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:57.469
I have never had a day's problem
with Jimmy.

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:00.072
Five. He's a wonderful boy.

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:19.627
Am I supposed to say
everything that I'm thinking about?

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.866
Jimmy saw us naked.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:31.013
I mean, sometimes we...

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:35.580
walk around undressed.
We don't put clothes on...

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.119
I mean, that kind of thing
doesn't embarrass us.

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:41.156
I mean that when Jimmy is in the room...

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:43.749
or walks in the room,
and I don't have any clothes on...

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:46.989
I don't put clothes on
just because he walks in the room.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.990
But I was just thinking that...

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.564
I got angry at him once.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:03:01.204
I don't know.
I think it was because Bob and I <i>...</i>

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.077
Did I say Bob?

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:19.254
That was a Freudian slip.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:20.888
Ted.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.267
Ted and I.

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:29.596
The way you're looking at me.

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:35.175
Ted and I were going to have sex,
and we wanted to have sex...

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:42.414
and Jimmy walked into the room.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:46.719
And it was daytime,
and I got nervous, so I scolded him...

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.451
for not knocking at the door
before he walked in.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:53.325
He's so cute. You know how children are.
I mean, they're very curious.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:02.066
He wanted to know why I had a tee-tee.

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:05.904
Pardon me? I don't know what a tee-tee is.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:16.015
- A vagina.
- It's a pet expression of yours?

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:20.954
Yes, you know words, tee-tee, tinkle,
po-po, wee-wee, kee-kee, poo-poo.

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.385
I'd never heard tee-tee before.

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.689
What expression do you use
with your children?

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.955
Vagina.

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:39.370
I'm really very embarrassed
by this whole thing.

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.672
I don't have anything else to say.
I really don't.

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:45.043
When we come right up to sex,
you become embarrassed.

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:48.150
What am I <i>...</i> What would you like <i>...</i>
What am I supposed to say?

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.550
I have no wants.
Say what you think you'd like to say.

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:54.818
Do you think I need this?
Do you really think you can help me?

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.689
I think it'd be useful to talk some more.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.920
I don't know for sure
if I can help you or not.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.554
Do you think you can help yourself?

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:09.298
Ted is a very nervous man!

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:14.136
Now sex is very important to a man.
You know that.

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:17.009
It seems your time is up for today.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:26.548
- Maybe I don't trust Ted?
- Let's talk about that on Thursday.

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:33.719
Do you think that that's a possibility?
That maybe that's what it's about?

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.766
Let's continue Thursday,
and we'll discuss it at that time.

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:43.763
Is it possible that I was being hostile
to Carol? Could that <i>...</i>

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:46.103
I don't know why it could be.
Why do you think <i>...</i>

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:48.871
Our hour is over.
We ought to take that up next Thursday.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.345
I resented her. Why was that?

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:52.972
We play tennis, we <i>...</i>

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:56.541
Sounds like we have a lot to talk about.
Let's do it at the next meeting.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.746
The same time at Tuesday.
We must stop now.

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.984
Sean! Put on your life jacket.

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.487
Jimmy! Cut it out!

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:12.795
Jimmy! No running around the pool.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.136
Alice looks terrific, doesn't she?

01:06:20.209 --> 01:06:22.677
I'm going up to San Francisco again
this weekend.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:26.010
- You gonna see the blond?
- I don't know.

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.983
I thought you didn't want to know about
that kind of thing.

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:31.076
All right, I don't want to know.

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.851
Do me a favor. If you come back...

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:36.289
and you have any great news,
just don't tell Alice.

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:38.623
Most of the time, I just sit there.
Nothing to say.

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:41.959
- Something's happening. I can tell.
- Really?

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:47.226
I definitely do not have that animosity
towards you and Bob anymore.

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:50.397
- I know.
- But you know, I still think you're crazy.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.737
That's your problem. That's your bag.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.773
I really can't tell anymore...

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.542
whether it's coming out
of your mouth or hers or what.

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.480
You've never in your whole life...

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.576
had such prurient thoughts yourself,
is that it?

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.580
No, I've thought about it.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:12.286
Hi, there. I couldn't help noticing you.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.687
I find you absolutely
an extremely attractive man.

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.757
I would like to give you a little jump rope.

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:23.635
I realize, of course, that you're married,
but I promise there'll be no complications.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:35.206
There's a double standard operating here,
and I'm not gonna play that game.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:40.178
I am not gonna do anything
I don't want my wife to do.

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:41.723
And you know something?

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:46.387
I don't believe that you could handle it
if Carol had an affair, God forbid.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.457
I could handle it.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.360
Go play over there.

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:57.168
I've looked at other women.
I've had feelings. Alice never ever...

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.366
Let's play choo-choo train.

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:03.803
- Go play over <i>...</i>
- Choo-choo train! Let's go!

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.109
Remember when I went to New York
last year?

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:10.084
I had a lot of work to do.
I was there for two and a half days.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:14.019
So they assigned me
one of those temporary secretaries.

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.885
And she was <i>...</i>

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.658
- Here's your drink, darling.
- Thank you very much.

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.696
- Ted, do you want one?
- No.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.665
She was a very lovely woman.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:32.966
Naomi.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.470
You wouldn't know her.
She lives in New York.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.569
She was divorced...

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:43.381
and she was earning a living,
and she was beautiful.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:46.046
We were working late...

01:08:46.788 --> 01:08:48.279
and there was an attraction.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:51.189
You know, when a woman looks at you,
and you know. You know?

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:55.720
- I know.
- No, I've never ever strayed. Never.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.064
We were working late.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.264
We had a drink.

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:07.734
In my hotel room.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.674
And I don't know how it happened...

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.180
but suddenly we were kissing.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.682
And her mouth was open.

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:19.912
That's beautiful. See, that's a lovely thing.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:23.254
Fantastic. It was really <i>...</i> It was exciting.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.620
And I'd just spoken to Alice
a couple of minutes before...

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:29.788
to say hello and see
how the kids were, you know?

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:32.332
And I had this terrible feeling
of ambivalence...

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:35.301
- you know, at my pleasure.
- I don't believe it.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:39.298
I couldn't go on with it!
It was so frustrating.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:43.444
She wanted to go to <i>...</i>
Naomi wanted to go to bed.

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.442
How could you, man?

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:52.684
How can you let a moment
disappear out of your life...

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:55.815
that will never ever come again?
It won't come again.

01:09:55.891 --> 01:10:00.089
Do you realize you're here
for about 10 seconds? For Pete's sake!

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:04.326
- It's part of life, it's meant to be lived.
- Yeah, but I had such guilt.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.063
Look at you, man,
you got the guilt anyway. Don't waste it.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:58.780
<i>Hi, my name is Ted. Ted Henderson.</i>

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:02.552
<i>I</i>'<i>m on my way to Miami</i>
<i>for a legal convention.</i>

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:06.825
I'm married. I have a wonderful child.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.798
My wife's name is Alice.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.098
I've never ever strayed.

01:11:15.804 --> 01:11:20.070
Once. Almost. With Naomi in New York.
That was <i>...</i> I almost did then.

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:23.541
There's no chance for us to have an affair...

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:26.638
but I'm just trying to seize the moment,
you know?

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:30.549
I know that's
an intellectual statement, but <i>...</i>

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.187
And there's absolutely no chance for me.

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:37.692
Like I said, I'm married. Alice and I
have been married for 12 years.

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:43.859
We feel differently about sex
than your generation.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:50.097
Anyway, it's been very nice talking to you.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.904
You seem like a very nice person.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.142
<i>Well I</i>'<i>d better go now.</i>

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:58.975
<i>Obviously, you have no interest</i>
<i>in having any kind of...</i>

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.640
We're in Miami.

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.843
<i>... sexual encounter with me.</i>

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.362
Hi. My name is Ted. Ted Henderson.

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:22.700
I'm on my way to Miami
for a legal convention.

01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:26.769
- I'll put in three frames from here.
- Yeah. Will do.

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:33.543
Okay. Listen, it's been a pleasure
working with you, honey.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.515
- You're very good.
- Thank you.

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.950
If you ever want to work
in Los Angeles, let me know.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.147
You catching a plane tonight?

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.585
I don't know.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:47.561
Steak, baked potatoes, garlic toast, and gin?

01:12:47.796 --> 01:12:49.730
All we need is vermouth.

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.365
I think I'll go home.

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:58.829
- Next time.
- Next time. Good night.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.865
I thought you were coming back tomorrow.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.475
Finished early.

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:44.953
That's a marvelous scent.
You smell wonderful.

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.452
- Thank you, darling.
- But I did miss you.

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:49.457
In San Francisco, honey...

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:52.686
in San Francisco, no scenes of any kind.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:56.925
You could've.
Anything you do is all right with me.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.965
I love you.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.702
I love you.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:05.096
You'd better get yourself ready...

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.267
'cause one of the great ones
is coming your way.

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:09.742
- I have to tell you something.
- All right, tell me.

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.541
Look, don't open the door.

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:18.119
- You bought me something.
- No.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:24.282
- There's someone in there.
- What, is it Sean or what?

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:25.684
No.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.528
There's a man in there.

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:33.032
Doing what? What do you mean,
there's a man in there?

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.768
I'm having an affair.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.602
- He's in there now.
- What are you talking about?

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:42.405
I'm having an affair!

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.609
What are you doing to me?

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.783
Actually, affair is the wrong word.

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:52.116
What do you mean?
What are you doing to me?

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.280
How can you react this way?

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:58.387
- Where's my child? Sean!
- He's at my mother's.

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:06.596
- Who's in there?
- A man.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.398
- Who is it?
- Do you want to know his name?

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:12.235
Who is he? Just don't give me any names.

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:14.832
Is there really somebody in there right now?
This second?

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:18.744
- Yes, of course. Open the door.
- I'll kill him! I'll kill the son of a bitch!

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.907
This is the man who held my face...

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.474
and said to me that
we should be open with each other?

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:27.955
- Everything I do, you have to do?
- I didn't do it because you did it!

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:29.785
Why then?

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:33.089
- I did it because I wanted to do it.
- Why, God almighty?

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:34.594
- Why?
- Because.

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:38.963
Because I wanted to do it.
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:41.762
Why in my house? Why in my bed?

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:45.598
Bob, I mean, it just seemed like
a convenient thing.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.904
You were not going to be here.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:58.043
- He's not in my pajamas, is he?
- No!

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.683
I'm sorry.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:20.407
Why didn't you call me?

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:23.076
Why couldn't you have called me and said:

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:24.945
"Bob, I want to have an affair.

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:27.447
"Please, can I have an affair?" You call me.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.677
Bob, I mean, I couldn't do that.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:33.619
- You can't call to ask for permission.
- Yeah, it's something.

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:37.557
You always call me, darling.

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:40.388
And this time you didn't call.

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:43.955
- I need a drink.
- What would you like?

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:46.592
- You want me to get it for you, darling?
- No.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.597
I have to get this out and get it dealt with.

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:53.630
Go and tell him to put his clothes on,
come downstairs, and have a drink with us.

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:55.040
I'll tell him.

01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:02.546
That his car outside?

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.542
- Yes.
- The Chevy?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.020
The Maserati.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.159
He's afraid to come down.
He's afraid you're going to hit him.

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.757
I'm not gonna hit him! For <i>...</i>

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.999
Hit him in my house, that's beautiful.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:31.305
Listen, I'm not going to hit.
There isn't going to be any hitting.

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:35.442
We don't do that in this house.
It's a nonviolent household.

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:38.953
We don't even allow any war toys
in the house.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.753
Sir. Hello.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.425
He really is scared, poor guy.

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:53.728
Hello?

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.098
I never should have brought him here.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:00.869
Yes, you should.
You did the right thing. You were open.

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:02.569
No. I didn't.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:08.178
- I did the wrong thing.
- No, you did not.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.413
You know, you don't bring them
to your own house.

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:15.354
Look, I didn't have your kind of courage.

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:18.860
I had to do it in a cheap hotel room
in San Francisco.

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:23.721
You brought him right into your own home.

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:33.102
You make me feel like a little kid.
Five years old.

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:35.541
Wants to have his cake and eat it...

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:38.468
and doesn't want anybody else to have any.

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.512
I love you.

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:48.387
Oh, my God.

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:51.685
Insight.

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:55.620
For the love of <i>...</i>

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:01.859
Lights are going on, baby, in my head.
Lights going on. Insight.

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:05.003
What happened?

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:08.338
What actually took place?
What really, actually did happen?

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:11.379
You had a thing with a man.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.448
- Yes.
- I mean, you already had it, didn't you?

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:17.985
Then. Nobody's hurt.

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:19.486
- Is anybody hurt?
- No.

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:21.715
Physical, it was a physical thing.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.258
- No love?
- No. None whatsoever.

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:30.860
What the <i>...</i> For heaven's sake.

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:35.330
Listen, man, you decent? I'm coming in.

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:40.633
Hi.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:45.401
I'm Bob Sanders, Carol's husband.

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:48.277
And I'm not gonna hit you
or anything like that.

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.682
It's nice to know you.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:20:00.385
- I have seen you at the tennis courts.
- Yes, I teach tennis.

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:03.553
- I'm very embarrassed.
- Listen.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.157
Come on, now. That's
what I was trying to say.

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.794
You mustn't be embarrassed.
You mustn't feel ill at ease.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:12.067
I don't want that. Please, sit down. Here.

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:19.876
- Would you like to have a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:22.747
Okay. Carol, could we <i>...</i>

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:26.115
- Wait a minute, now. What would you like?
- Pernod.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.789
I don't think we have any Pernod.

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:32.053
- Scotch is fine.
- We haven't had <i>...</i> Scotch?

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:35.927
Yeah, sure. Listen, I got Teachers, J&B...

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:39.933
let's see, we've got, Cutty Sark...

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.970
I've got some 12-year-old Ballantine.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:45.131
- Ballantine would be nice.
- That's beautiful.

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:47.767
Let's have a couple
of Ballantines. Mine on the rocks.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.311
- On the rocks with a little water.
- A little water.

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.749
I don't think I actually,
I didn't get your name before.

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:04.052
Horst.

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:06.924
H-O-R-S-T.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.191
Listen, we...

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:18.932
my wife and I, you know, Carol and I,
recently we had...

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.638
a weekend experience.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.942
They call it <i>...</i>
It's at a place called the institute.

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:28.642
I know. Carol told me about it.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.182
Then you know
that we've been experimenting...

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:35.553
in the whole field of sexual freedom.

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.592
- I believe in that.
- I know.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:42.262
And that's why, among other things,
I'd like to apologize for all of that...

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:44.461
- shouting...
- No...

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:48.127
No, I mean it. I didn't mean to,
I was caught a little off-balance.

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:50.831
I feel very uncomfortable
sitting here in your bedroom.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.033
Please, I don't want you to feel that way.

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.406
The one thing
that isn't necessary is for you to <i>...</i>

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:58.071
I was just telling Horst that it really is...

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:01.604
very unnecessary for him
to feel uncomfortable, that he should be <i>...</i>

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:02.877
That's good.

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:06.250
- You are one hell of a guy.
- Didn't I tell you?

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.913
I'm trying.

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:12.350
You've got a lot of class.

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:15.155
Thank you.

- Hello there!

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:21.519
So this is the Riviera.
Where's the concert theatre?

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.193
Freshen up?

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:32.835
I have money. Good, let's go over there.

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:35.205
- I'll give you some money later.
- Okay.

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.245
- Sanders? Sanders's party?
- Right, sir.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:45.283
We're gonna get ourselves a suite,
we're gonna do some heavy gambling.

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:50.716
- How do you spell Sanders?
- S-A-N-D-E-R.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:53.718
Room 934.

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:57.458
- I'll bet you $100 on 934.
- You don't bet here, you bet there.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:23:59.363
I'm betting $100 on 934.

01:24:03.505 --> 01:24:05.769
Honey, two jackpots!

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:12.340
Wait a minute, one more.

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:23.187
- We won! Do you believe this?
- Okay.

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:27.024
- Sorry, folks. We're just checking in.
- Do you believe it?

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.930
- Honey, can we come back and play?
- Wasn't that terrific?

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:36.930
You just give him a kiss for us...

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:40.736
and tell him we'll bring him back
some chips, okay? Goodbye.

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:46.404
Jimmy's fine. He's terrific.

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.143
Jimmy who? Do we have a Jimmy?

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:52.448
- No, we don't have a Jimmy.
- I give you a toast...

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.617
to Alice.

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:58.688
- Why me?
- Because you're nice.

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:03.990
Here's a toast to Bob and Carol
and Ted and Alice.

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:06.625
- That's a good <i>...</i> I'll drink to us.
- That's an <i>...</i>

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:09.261
Four of the grooviest people
I've ever known.

01:25:10.004 --> 01:25:12.131
I'm really getting drunk, you know?

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:13.572
- Are you, honey?
- Crocked.

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:16.371
- What time is the show?
- We've got about another half hour.

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.378
- Will you fix me another drink?
- Yes, dear.

01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:22.177
I love Tony Bennett. You know why?

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.548
He just sings, right there.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.678
<i>San Francisco</i>

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:28.856
<i>Open your golden bird</i>

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:33.351
A very interesting choice of song.

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:36.124
I take it all back about the toast.
You're very bad.

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:39.792
How come I haven't heard the box score
on your last trip to San Francisco?

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:43.827
Actually, the reason for that is because,
there's nothing to tell.

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:47.068
You mean, you went to San Francisco
and didn't see that girl again?

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:48.575
Honey, it's none of your business.

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:50.577
- Bob, do you mind?
- No!

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.772
Carol? You're sure?

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:59.049
I do not mind because, in all truth,
I must report to you that...

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.615
that lady wasn't in San Francisco.

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:05.388
I see.

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:13.659
You really go for the nitty-gritty nowadays,
don't you, dear?

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.268
- I think it's great.
- Do you?

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.395
I do, too. I think it's marvelous. No kidding.

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.940
I hope we'll always be honest
and open with each other.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.909
Really? You been getting any action
in town lately?

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:26.336
You're beautiful.

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:28.177
No action.

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:30.274
What are you, writing a gossip column?

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:33.878
At least not by me, in any event or rate.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:37.990
- What does that mean?
- Nothing, I was just joking.

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.526
You were not.

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.522
- Sure I was!
- No, you weren't.

01:26:42.597 --> 01:26:43.621
I was <i>...</i>

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:46.693
What?

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:49.066
You ready for some of the big stuff now?

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:51.662
- Sure.
- Come on, Alice that's enough.

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.934
One thing I think I've learned in therapy...

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:56.476
is that I must not impose
my values on the world.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:59.911
I love my friends, no matter what they do.
Now what'd you do?

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.988
I can't claim no credit for myself...

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:19.059
- but Carol had an affair.
- Who?

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:21.499
We don't want to know.
Don't tell us who it is.

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:24.265
- I don't want to know.
- Who? Who was it?

01:27:26.107 --> 01:27:27.233
Horst.

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:32.471
He was very decent about it, actually.
He offered to give me tennis lessons.

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:38.817
It's all right. You know? I'm very moved.

01:27:39.387 --> 01:27:42.379
- Really. I feel I'm sharing a very...
- I had an affair.

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:46.052
...precious moment with you, you know?
That's good, honey.

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.288
I mean, I feel that it's right there...

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:50.923
- I had an affair.
- Honey, I said that's good.

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:54.258
I mean, you just don't come
right out and tell everybody...

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:56.826
I had an affair when I was in Miami.

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:14.517
I had an affair when I was in Miami, Alice.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.120
I met her on the airplane.

01:28:27.869 --> 01:28:29.427
I hired a car.

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:33.201
And we exchanged a couple of words,
and I was taking her home.

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.339
And I did it, Alice!

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:43.346
It really happened, Alice. It was fantastic.

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:51.323
It was no love, Alice,
it was just the girl was totally open.

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:08.801
What are you doing?

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:11.106
- I'm getting undressed.
- Alice, relax.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:13.579
- Relax.
- Stop it, Alice.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:18.608
I am being honest.
I'm doing what I feel like doing.

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:20.153
What do you feel like doing?

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:22.451
I feel like doing
what we came up here to do.

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.321
- And what is that?
- Orgy. Have an orgy.

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.556
- Alice.
- Orgy!

01:29:29.964 --> 01:29:31.829
You're just getting even with Ted.

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:34.561
Listen. Will you tell me
why you think we came up here?

01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:36.899
- To have fun!
- And what is more fun than an orgy?

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:39.496
You're flipping.
Will you put your clothes on?

01:29:39.574 --> 01:29:41.769
That fooling around in the car
and all that stuff.

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:43.902
You don't think that was accidental,
do you?

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.912
- Alice, darling, look.
- What?

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.005
You're being completely psychoanalytical.

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.811
I have no interest in sleeping with Ted.

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:51.909
I have no interest in sleeping with Carol.

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:53.544
You'd love to sleep with Carol!

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:56.112
And you're dying to do it with Ted.

01:29:56.624 --> 01:30:00.958
That's sick.
That is really a sick thing to say, Alice.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:04.156
- I have no interest in sleeping with Ted.
- No?

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.492
But you slept with Horst.

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:12.397
But that was an entirely different situation.

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:14.941
- It was different.
- That was totally different.

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.533
There was no friendship there.

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:18.101
- There was no love.
- Right.

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:20.409
- I mean, Ted is like my family.
- Is he?

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:23.712
- We love each other. We're involved.
- We're like brother and sister.

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:25.946
- It would be incestuous.
- Cop-out!

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.080
You're just being perverse,
I shouldn't have told you. I'm sorry.

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:30.886
I had no right having an affair.

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:33.119
You had every right,
just as I have the right...

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.593
I told you because I'm guilty.

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:37.290
- You enjoyed it, didn't you?
- I couldn't help myself.

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:39.629
- She was a very attractive girl.
- Listen.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:43.602
I don't want to sleep with Ted.
Bob does not want to sleep with you.

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:46.663
Wait a minute.
Bob doesn't want to sleep with me? Bob.

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.231
- Don't be disgusting.
- Bob!

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:50.106
- Alice, don't be disgusting.
- Bob!

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:51.338
Hello.

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:56.739
Would you like to go to bed with me?

01:30:57.652 --> 01:31:00.280
- Bob.
- Come on, Alice.

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.585
Honey, come on.

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:05.817
You're trying to make me say something...

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:08.987
that's going to embarrass everybody,
and make you very unhappy.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:13.932
I don't think so.
Look, never in my wildest imagination...

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:17.331
in the darkest recesses of my mind <i>...</i>

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:21.239
- You're the wife of my best friend.
- Forget your mind. We're not discussing it.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:23.641
- You're talking about...
- Do you want to go to bed?

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:25.508
...an imaginary situation.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.378
- Could you make love to me?
- Will you cut this out?

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:29.882
Don't cop out. Can you?

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.942
- I suppose I could.
- You son of a bitch!

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:34.419
Great friend!
You're a great friend to me. My friend.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:36.787
That's your husband.
He could make love to my wife.

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:39.349
Come on, she's dealing with
an imaginary situation.

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:41.725
- Cop-out!
- And I'm trying to be honest.

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:46.298
And don't tell me that you couldn't possibly
make love to Carol.

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:48.667
Absolutely not!

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:52.234
- Under no condition.
- Is that a fact?

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:55.867
- You don't find Carol attractive?
- Of course I find her attractive.

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:58.377
And I love her very much, but like my sister.

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:01.244
I know you love her, man.
That's not in question here.

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:03.078
Does she turn you on?

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:07.146
Yes, in a way,
but that's because of our relationship.

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:08.518
No. Forget the relationship.

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:11.752
I can't forget about it.
I can't forget our relationship.

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:15.694
I let a tennis pro do it, I would let you do it.
Don't you see?

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:18.357
Now, just give me an answer. Yes or no?

01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:21.932
Insight.

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.641
What a beautiful woman!

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:36.783
You see. You see right through us.

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.878
You're beautiful.

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:42.379
- You know where it's at.
- You're helping a lot.

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:46.015
No. She's right. Alice is right.

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:50.393
This is where we are at.
Now what is wrong? What is so wrong?

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:53.627
Wait a second. Carol, look,
we're a close-knit group of people.

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:54.998
We see each other all the time.

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:59.165
I think it's difficult enough for us
to maintain one sexual relationship at home.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.707
And one in Miami.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:06.179
- Carol, stop it.
- Bob, Alice is absolutely right.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.820
We have to be straight about this.

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:19.048
Now I'm beginning to feel something.

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:22.389
I'm beginning to feel excited.

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.426
Now do you want me to deny that?

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:28.490
No.

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:34.132
What do you feel for Alice?

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:40.807
- Alice, I could go to bed with you.
- I'm not going to bed with anybody.

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:43.846
Why, Ted? Why not?

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:47.744
- I know you too well.
- Lf Bob says it's all right...

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:51.258
and Alice says it's all right,
and I say it's all right.

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:58.889
- It just seems wrong.
- It's not.

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:02.629
Look, it's just nice feelings,
it's something that we've never done before.

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:05.501
It's physical fun. It's just sex.

01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:08.575
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:16.248
I do feel aroused. I can't deny that.

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:26.251
- It would be purely physical.
- Purely. It would be purely physical.

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:31.397
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:34:57.591 --> 01:35:01.994
- She's right, man. It's beautiful.
- But what the hell is the big deal?

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:05.664
We're supposed to experience everything.

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:08.692
Honey, would you get that?

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:15.030
First we'll have an orgy,
and then we'll go see Tony Bennett.

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:38.791
Come on.

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:26.824
No.

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:45.274
Did you put any money into Pittston, Bob?

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.445
No.

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:52.815
I'm sick with myself, too.

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:57.120

Worthington Oil...

01:38:57.798 --> 01:39:00.562
and it was only at three,
and I didn't take any myself.

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:03.000
What is it at now?

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:05.766
Fifteen.

01:39:06.305 --> 01:39:12.774
