00:01.585 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously,
on</i> Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.171 --> 00:06.674
I've been waiting a long time
for a face-to-face.

00:09.427 --> 00:10.594
There's a stretch of time in there

00:10.761 --> 00:13.222
that's unaccounted for
when no one was in contact.

00:13.431 --> 00:15.349
<i>- They switched people out.</i>
- The plan worked.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.560
We have replaced
the top operatives at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.520
- How many?
- All of them.

00:43.794 --> 00:47.214
Studies show music
increases dopamine levels by nine percent.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.217
So, I picked a recording

00:50.384 --> 00:52.053
that seemed to be one of your favourites.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.889
I always imagined...

00:55.973 --> 00:58.434
this would be good music to be born to...

00:59.602 --> 01:00.603
not...

01:01.729 --> 01:02.772
the other thing.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.191
I didn't bring you here to die.

01:06.484 --> 01:07.693
I'm going to save you.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.154
I'm not afraid to go.

01:11.197 --> 01:14.492
One of my prime directives
is to protect the Framework.

01:15.201 --> 01:16.744
- And I need you alive to do that.
- No!

01:17.078 --> 01:20.164
I don't want to live
as a festering cripple.

01:20.498 --> 01:23.501
And you better not be talking about
messing with my brain.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.961
I don't want to be a thing
like you.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.299
Don't worry.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.180
You'll be many things.

02:01.539 --> 02:05.000
- We have to get out of here.
- No, Jemma, we have to be careful.

02:05.251 --> 02:08.169
- They can't know that we know.
- But we can only imagine

02:08.336 --> 02:09.922
what the Russian and Radcliffe
programmed them to do.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.590
They could kill us,
or they could... they...

02:11.757 --> 02:14.051
Okay, okay, okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.761
If they wanted to,
they would have already.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.596
Unless they're waiting to separate us

02:17.763 --> 02:19.306
from the general population,
then kill us

02:19.473 --> 02:21.267
- or switch us or...
- Okay. Okay, okay.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.311
Take a breath, take a breath. It's okay.

02:26.897 --> 02:30.609
The one advantage we have over them
is they don't know that we're on to them.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.028
- Yeah.
- But they're gonna be suspicious

02:33.612 --> 02:35.197
- if we don't act normal.
- Right. Yeah.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.199
Maybe we could ask someone
who wasn't on the op...

02:37.366 --> 02:38.367
Agent Fitz.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.286
Yes, Coulson, sir.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.622
We haven't been able to locate
the submarine on satellite.

02:43.789 --> 02:44.832
In your best estimation,

02:44.999 --> 02:47.084
do you think it has
missile-launch capabilities?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.714
Well, we couldn't know that for sure,
but one could posit that, yeah.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.885
Mm. Then we'll have to assume the worst.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.762
That the Russian has people
to enact his endgame.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.141
And his goal in life
was to kill all Inhumans.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.186
That's why we're bringing them
all here, to headquarters.

03:07.313 --> 03:09.690
Of course. Makes perfect sense.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.820
Uh. Well, once this storm has cleared up,

03:14.987 --> 03:17.615
uh, and the Director has fully recovered,
we can start

03:17.698 --> 03:19.450
- to put a system together to...
- I've recovered enough.

03:20.492 --> 03:24.330
- My God, that was fast.
- A little sore, but I'll manage.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.791
I think Daisy here should contact
the Inhumans personally

03:27.917 --> 03:30.461
and oversee their transfer to HQ.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.087
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll help make calls.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.216
- That's our top priority.
- Along with finding Agent May, right?

03:36.675 --> 03:37.676
Of course.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.553
Well, perhaps Simmons and I
should retire to my office

03:39.720 --> 03:42.681
and, uh, discuss
the logistics of the search.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.725
Actually, we...

03:46.477 --> 03:50.064
discovered an old USSR
communication hardware device,

03:50.231 --> 03:51.357
um, on the raid.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.235
Maybe they used that for communicating.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.028
But we should probably keep
a brain trust together

03:56.195 --> 03:57.363
until we can decipher the code.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.533
Good idea.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.244
Time's a-wasting. Let's get to it.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.837
We need to scan and replace
those last two immediately.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.048
Carefully, undetected.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.634
- We're still outnumbered here.
- Not for long.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.970
In the meantime, Daisy will contact
the Inhumans,

04:21.136 --> 04:22.846
inform them she's coming
to collect them personally.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.141
Yes... and execute them on sight.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.351
Which reminds me...

04:28.185 --> 04:30.396
the hardware we brought
from the Russian's loading dock...

04:30.562 --> 04:32.273
Still in the shipping container
on <i>Zephyr One.</i>

04:32.398 --> 04:34.608
I'll oversee it's off-loaded
down into the basement now.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.075
Yo-Yo's our most-valuable asset,
so we want to get to her first.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.535
Sounds like the right idea.

04:53.127 --> 04:56.088
- Yo-Yo, we're coming to get you.
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>

04:59.425 --> 05:00.426
You're in danger.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.105
I have so many memories of snow.

05:14.732 --> 05:17.359
My first-time ice-skating
on my neighbour's pond.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.529
A month stationed near the French Alps.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.990
But the truth is...

05:24.325 --> 05:26.076
this is the first time I've seen it.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.748
My phantom limb used to ache
in cold weather.

05:31.707 --> 05:32.708
But now...

05:33.500 --> 05:34.752
I don't feel that pain.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.505
I haven't felt this good
in years.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.175
What are you saying?

05:43.260 --> 05:45.596
No. Oh, God, no.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.681
- What did Radcliffe do?
- May, it's okay.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.600
This is why I'm locked up in here!

05:49.725 --> 05:50.976
- Hey.
- You're not afraid of what I'll do.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.561
- You're afraid that they'll discover you!
- It's okay.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.646
We can help them, too.
May, this is a good thing.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.524
- This is a very good thing.
- How can you possibly think that?

05:58.942 --> 05:59.943
I get it.

06:00.486 --> 06:01.945
My programming is different than yours.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.656
You had to discover that
your body had been replaced.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.493
- You must've felt blindsided.
- Like reality was crashing down.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.746
Whereas I still have my mind
but know exactly what I am.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.164
And more importantly,

06:12.414 --> 06:15.000
I understand a basic truth
that you don't realise yet.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.668
And what's that?

06:17.628 --> 06:19.129
That our bodies don't matter.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.008
Radcliffe built a world,

06:23.592 --> 06:25.928
a world exactly like this one.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.431
Every molecular detail the same, just...

06:31.058 --> 06:32.893
with a little less hurt for each of us.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.396
What do you mean, "hurt"?

06:36.355 --> 06:38.941
Imagine if your greatest regret
could be wiped away.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.402
Do you know
what that would be?

06:44.238 --> 06:45.322
I do.

06:45.864 --> 06:46.865
And you?

06:52.621 --> 06:55.290
I sometimes wonder
what it would've been like...

06:56.208 --> 06:57.376
if I'd never signed up.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.338
All the loss... the grief...

07:02.548 --> 07:05.008
All of my regrets
are piled up after that.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.971
Could've lived like a civilian, you know?

07:10.597 --> 07:11.682
The simple life.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.732
Now we can have that.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.236
Are you saying we'll
eventually be able to be...

07:25.362 --> 07:27.573
- together?
- I'm saying that in the Framework,

07:27.990 --> 07:29.074
we already are.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.125
Radcliffe gassed them during the raid.
That's why we lost time.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.252
Quick scan of the brain,
transfer that data to a body,

07:40.419 --> 07:42.963
- which must have already been built?
- Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.298
He could've had... Sorry.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.634
...could've had digital scans
of their features.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.054
From the eyes of the May android.
Complete physical geometry.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.098
So, he could've replaced anybody.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.161
What is...

08:15.579 --> 08:16.580
Let me see.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.173
Well, the... lab techs must've
taken it upon themselves

08:26.340 --> 08:29.885
to mount LMD detection devices
randomly throughout the base.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.515
I mean, there must be a calibration error.
It's reading the equipment or something.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.099
- Whoa!
- Stay right there.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.851
- Hey, Jemma...
- Back away!

08:38.227 --> 08:39.477
- Back away until we can...
- All right!

08:39.645 --> 08:41.897
- ...figure this out.
- Figure what out?

08:42.147 --> 08:44.983
You're pointing a gun at me.
Why are you pointing a gun at me?

08:50.531 --> 08:51.532
No.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.116
Don't move.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.702
It's you.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.205
Shut up. Shut up!

08:58.372 --> 09:00.374
You suggested that
we come to the workshop...

09:01.375 --> 09:02.543
alone. You brought me here.

09:02.751 --> 09:06.046
No, you... you were... you were the one
telling me to act normal, and...

09:06.129 --> 09:07.965
- You knew how the LMDs were made.
- you didn't want to leave the base,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.174
- saying it was a calibration error!
- You knew!

09:09.258 --> 09:12.302
- There's no calibration error!
- I'm not the one that's pointing the gun!

09:12.386 --> 09:14.054
I bloody well know
that I'm not an android!

09:14.221 --> 09:16.807
You would lie and say that if you were!
You'd be programmed to!

09:17.015 --> 09:19.685
Oh, you don't...
you don't know.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.480
You don't even know, like May.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.649
Stop it! The... the same goes for you.

09:26.024 --> 09:29.236
Of course, this is happening.
This always happens to you, to me, to us.

09:29.695 --> 09:30.821
It's my worst fear coming true again.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.406
- You don't even know.
- I'm not a bloody LMD!

09:32.489 --> 09:33.824
You're messing with me,
messing with my head!

09:33.907 --> 09:35.617
- It's not me, Jemma!
- Well, it's one of us!

09:43.458 --> 09:45.794
It's one of us, Fitz.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.009
Well, regardless of who it is...

09:54.469 --> 09:55.512
it's my fault.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.765
It is.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.767
It is.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.270
I perfected the technology.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.731
I started this whole nightmare.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.151
I'm sorry.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.570
I'm sorry.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.655
Don't...

10:14.323 --> 10:16.283
make me feel bad for you.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.495
Don't hurt me.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.497
I couldn't.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.628
I'm not gonna fight you, Jemma.
Even if you are a decoy.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.841
I'm the bad guy, okay?
No matter what.

10:35.886 --> 10:36.970
So, I'll do whatever you say.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.264
Okay? I'll do whatever you say.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.229
Pick it up.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.569
And do what, Jemma?

10:53.612 --> 10:54.613
Cut your wrist.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.825
If you're the LMD,
I'll see your substructure and I'll know.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.953
- And if not...
- If not, then you're the android,

11:02.079 --> 11:03.455
and you just convinced me
to slit my wrist.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.581
Do it!

11:09.544 --> 11:10.545
Okay.

11:30.774 --> 11:34.236
Oh!

11:34.820 --> 11:37.656
- That's a lot of blood.
- Did you cut the radial artery?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.616
I was trying very hard to miss it. I...

11:42.744 --> 11:46.581
Don't come near me!

11:47.457 --> 11:48.458
Oh, God!

11:51.253 --> 11:52.254
Fitz...

11:53.505 --> 11:55.257
Ah!

12:07.519 --> 12:09.563
- Welcome back, Doctor.
- Oh, what the hell?

12:10.731 --> 12:12.816
My orders were to bring me out
after 24 hours.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.193
- That's exactly what I did.
- Really?

12:16.528 --> 12:19.364
Oh, my God.
I completely lost track of time.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.866
Aida, there were...

12:21.992 --> 12:24.161
- changes.
- I had to restart the simulation

12:24.327 --> 12:25.996
to accommodate the new residents.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.293
In order to reduce their pain,
to fix a regret for each of them,

12:31.501 --> 12:34.337
I had to restart the Framework simulation
from those moments in time.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.381
Are you mad?

12:36.882 --> 12:38.467
I am programmed
to do just that.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.343
You shouldn't have done that
with me plugged in.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.971
I could've lost my grip on reality!

12:44.014 --> 12:45.265
To the human mind, there's no difference

12:45.432 --> 12:47.893
between the perception of the Framework
and the physical world.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.978
It...

12:50.645 --> 12:52.522
It's just so vast. This is all...

12:53.523 --> 12:54.608
perfectly real.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.359
I assure you,

12:56.651 --> 12:58.904
one of my prime directives
is keeping you safe.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.615
- The other is to protect the Framework.
- Protect the Framework, yes,

13:01.865 --> 13:04.534
which is why we've given that Russki
all that he wants,

13:05.035 --> 13:06.036
so that he'll guarantee

13:06.203 --> 13:09.289
the Framework has this palace
to operate within.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.791
The Russian, he's uh...

13:12.292 --> 13:14.336
- he's in good spirits?
- He's resting.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.546
Four LMDs are in place
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.090
And it's only a matter of time
before they get brain scans

13:19.257 --> 13:23.678
of the top remaining agents,
Jemma, and of course, Daisy.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.516
Are their commands working
on a subconscious level

13:27.682 --> 13:29.392
to avoid detection, as with Agent May?

13:29.768 --> 13:31.686
There wasn't time for such subtleties.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.232
They're much more objective-driven.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.026
Aida, people could be killed
in that scenario.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.486
Only if they resist.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.785
Okay. That's everyone.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.205
Do you really think it's necessary
for me to personally greet each of them?

13:50.372 --> 13:51.873
You don't think
that'll take too much time?

13:52.541 --> 13:57.212
- It'll be more efficient than you think.
- Okay. I'll suit up. <i>Zephyr</i> in ten?

13:57.420 --> 13:58.421
I'll be ready.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.594
I need you conscious
to map your frontal lobe,

14:04.761 --> 14:06.304
so you can't be too heavily sedated.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.559
The rest you can sleep through.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.188
You have Fitz's mind.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.107
Why are you doing this?

14:17.816 --> 14:18.942
I'm doing it for you.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.654
For us. What we've always suspected
I now know to be true

14:22.821 --> 14:25.448
that consciousness is separate
from the physical self.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.206
Don't hurt yourself, Jemma.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.297
There's no reason to be afraid.
I was always trying to protect you,

14:40.505 --> 14:43.133
pursuing technological solves
to the problematic scenario

14:43.300 --> 14:44.843
that you could be harmed or killed.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.971
But Radcliffe's cured death.
Once I map your brain,

14:48.179 --> 14:50.223
we'll never have to fear
losing each other again.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.103
Don't fight, Jemma. You're too weak.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.316
I'm securing our future.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.862
So we can get married,
grow old together.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.828
That's the first time
you've mentioned it...

15:14.873 --> 15:15.957
getting married.

15:16.625 --> 15:20.670
I mean... I've thought about it.
But I was afraid to bring it up.

15:21.963 --> 15:22.964
You know...

15:24.090 --> 15:26.843
I thought I knew your answer,
but no one's ever 100 percent.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.691
I'll tell Fitz when I see him.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.326
No. No!

15:51.576 --> 15:55.205
No! No! No! Ah! Jemma, please!

15:55.497 --> 15:56.498
Stop!

16:02.045 --> 16:05.298
Jemma, Jemma, look at me. Look at me.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.551
Stop. It's me.

16:09.761 --> 16:10.762
It's me.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.031
Prince, where's Agent Johnson?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.326
Yeah, Daisy told me to tell you
she wants to check the accommodations

16:33.576 --> 16:35.495
for the incoming Inhumans
before we head out.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.124
- The containment rooms downstairs?
- Yeah.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.418
Damn it.

18:02.290 --> 18:06.628
<i>Code three, West sector.
Repeat. Code three, West sector.</i>

18:30.276 --> 18:31.444
<i>It's Agent Fitz, sir.</i>

18:32.695 --> 18:34.405
<i>- We can see that.</i>
- Davis said Agent Simmons

18:34.572 --> 18:35.865
was the only one in here with him.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.701
Then it's what we feared.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.162
We believe Agent Simmons
has been compromised,

18:41.329 --> 18:44.207
replaced with an LMD.
We need to find her, scan her...

18:44.374 --> 18:45.375
No, wait.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.461
Look.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.716
- My God.
- Sir, we have to scan everyone.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.735
Daisy knows and she got away.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.571
Damn it.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.531
This is not how it was supposed to go.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.367
- We didn't want bloodshed.
- It's too late for that.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.663
Mack, see if you can patch up Fitz enough
so that he can fix himself.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.291
- We have to search the base.
- And cut the security feeds.

19:26.624 --> 19:27.792
<i>Already gave the order.</i>

19:53.985 --> 19:55.945
- Get away from me!
- Simmons.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.780
What the literal hell?

19:58.031 --> 20:00.283
What did I just see?
What just happened to Fitz?

20:00.450 --> 20:02.368
It wasn't him.
It wasn't him.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.122
- Did you kill him?
- No, not him.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.499
- It wasn't him.
- Are you a robot?

20:09.459 --> 20:14.881
Because I just saw a truckload of myself,
and Mack is in on it.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.133
And Coulson just bashed
an agent's head in and...

20:17.300 --> 20:20.678
They were all replaced. You, too.
It's not you. It's not you!

20:21.471 --> 20:22.513
Simmons...

20:23.806 --> 20:24.807
it's me.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.434
What about you?

20:26.851 --> 20:28.853
Prove to me that you're not
a frickin' robot.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.647
Because it looks like
you're malfunctioning.

20:30.772 --> 20:34.400
No way to prove it.
You won't know until they kill you.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.903
There's no way to know
until they kill you.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.534
Give me...

20:44.494 --> 20:46.204
Give me your hand. I'll quake you.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.497
- Don't touch me!
- Give me your hand!

20:47.664 --> 20:49.999
I'll quake you, not to hurt you!
Not to hurt you.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.542
Just enough to feel your bones...

20:52.085 --> 20:54.879
the... the real bones,
and not made of metal.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.006
I'm me.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.424
I hope.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.218
I'm not one of them.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.262
I can prove to you
that I'm not one, either.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.306
An LMD wouldn't have
Inhuman powers, right?

21:06.057 --> 21:07.183
That way, we'll both know.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.227
Don't touch me!

21:18.987 --> 21:20.071
Oh, thank God.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.038
<i>There's a beauty to it.</i>

21:29.956 --> 21:32.667
This body you're building,
the Russian won't approve.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.503
He'll come around.
I've observed his behaviour.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.881
I've observed much human behaviour.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.927
And the more I see,
the harder it gets to find a logic to it.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.306
Oh, you sweet girl,

21:46.472 --> 21:51.686
there is no logic to love,
anger, wonder, joy...

21:51.894 --> 21:54.814
I understand the concepts,
but I don't feel them myself.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.233
And unfortunately...

21:58.318 --> 22:00.320
they've created a paradox
in my programming.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.281
What do you mean? Explain.

22:04.032 --> 22:07.368
My two main parameters
are in opposition due to human emotions.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.330
I was programmed to protect the Framework,

22:10.788 --> 22:13.124
but also to preserve your life
above all others.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.126
Well, how is that a contradiction?

22:16.044 --> 22:18.546
Because the greatest threat
to the Framework, Doctor...

22:21.090 --> 22:22.133
is you.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.428
Well, that's simply not accurate.

22:25.887 --> 22:29.474
A defining human trait seems to be regret,
or so I've observed.

22:30.224 --> 22:33.811
You even asked me to repair one regret
for each person entering the Framework.

22:34.896 --> 22:35.938
Yes.

22:36.147 --> 22:39.317
Well, you Doctor,
exhibit poor self-control,

22:39.734 --> 22:42.153
and if you someday come to regret
building the Framework,

22:42.570 --> 22:44.947
you could change my parameters
and have me dismantle it.

22:48.534 --> 22:52.246
Why would you think I would ever do that?
I'm saving these people.

22:52.872 --> 22:57.460
I am giving them a replica of their life
with less pain.

22:57.919 --> 22:58.920
Yes.

22:59.295 --> 23:02.090
But their physical bodies
will eventually give out because of it.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.300
Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.136
Reality is just perception.

23:07.345 --> 23:10.681
They perceive it as real,
which makes it real.

23:10.973 --> 23:15.144
- They might not believe that.
- Yeah, but I do. I know it.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.439
I believe it to be true, wholeheartedly.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.695
Thank you for clarifying.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.698
That statement fixes the paradox.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.744
I can now solve both problems at once.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.296
Shh.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.806
You'll live a long life, free of pain.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.942
We know you're wondering why you're here.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.487
You've received orders.
Base is on a complete lockdown.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.406
Agent Coulson will explain why.

24:11.159 --> 24:15.746
Two of our best agents and friends,
Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons,

24:16.372 --> 24:17.457
have been kidnapped.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.792
And worse than that,

24:20.293 --> 24:21.294
they've been replaced.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.338
- What do you mean, "hope"?
- They'll say we're Life Model Decoys,

24:24.505 --> 24:26.632
turn all of HQ against us,
and have us killed.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.051
Okay. Well...

24:29.677 --> 24:30.761
maybe there's not a lot of hope

24:30.928 --> 24:33.806
that we're gonna get out of here,
but there is hope...

24:34.599 --> 24:35.766
that our team is still alive.

24:36.642 --> 24:37.894
Which means we have to try.

24:42.064 --> 24:46.027
From what Fitz told you,
it seems Radcliffe, in his twisted logic,

24:46.152 --> 24:47.945
is keeping them alive
in this Framework thing.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.616
- Which means they can be rescued.
- How?

24:52.116 --> 24:54.452
The Framework's origin signal
is untraceable.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.496
They could be anywhere on the planet.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.664
Which is why we have to go in.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.377
You mean... go in?

25:04.545 --> 25:05.880
- Hack in.
- Hack in.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.924
Plug ourselves into the Framework

25:08.508 --> 25:10.801
so we can find our people,
and we can wake them up

25:10.968 --> 25:13.387
and figure out where their bodies
are being kept. I don't know.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.181
Really, what's our other option?

25:15.640 --> 25:18.142
Shoot to maim... stomach, spine.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.353
It's imperative we pull the data
from their heads.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.313
Don't let their faces
cloud your judgment.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.565
The best way to ensure that
we can save them

25:25.149 --> 25:27.276
is to find these machines
pretending to be them...

25:28.319 --> 25:29.362
and take them down.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.157
Eyes and ears open, people. Let's move.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.746
So, we fight our way through the trained
military personnel,

25:38.913 --> 25:41.332
then the ultra-powerful android doubles
of our friends,

25:41.582 --> 25:44.544
somehow make it to the <i>Zephyr,</i>
which we can't fly, to escape the base

25:44.752 --> 25:47.380
and try to plug our minds
into an alternate reality.

25:48.506 --> 25:52.301
Okay, well, don't say it out loud,
because that made it sound way worse.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.804
Let's just keep it one thing at a time,
okay?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.685
We have sleeping gas.

26:01.352 --> 26:02.979
How many doses of that
antidote are there?

26:03.437 --> 26:04.480
I don't know.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.358
I can't think without Fitz.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.443
Simmons. Simmons, stay with me.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.362
We can't fight them, Daisy.
It's too much.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.905
- It's all too much.
- Hey, hey.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.907
Don't worry about fighting them, okay?

26:16.409 --> 26:20.121
- I will. I will take them on myself.
- No, Daisy, don't do this.

26:20.288 --> 26:21.289
You don't have your gauntlets

26:21.414 --> 26:22.623
- to protect your arms.
- It doesn't matter.

26:22.707 --> 26:25.710
Look, I know you still feel like
you have to atone for Lincoln's sacrifice,

26:25.793 --> 26:26.794
but sacrificing yourself

26:26.919 --> 26:28.588
- is not the answer.
- That is not what this is about.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.047
- I can't lose you, too!
- Look at me.

26:30.298 --> 26:33.593
Look at me. This is not a sacrifice play.

26:34.302 --> 26:35.303
You know why?

26:36.262 --> 26:37.555
Because I will beat them.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.725
You hear me? I know it.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.811
If for no other reason than this...

26:44.604 --> 26:47.565
through all the insane crap
we have gone through,

26:48.524 --> 26:49.650
the one thing I've known...

26:50.568 --> 26:51.611
without a doubt...

26:52.778 --> 26:53.821
the whole time...

26:56.407 --> 26:58.242
is you and Fitz belong together.

27:03.914 --> 27:05.958
This is not how your story ends.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.960
Okay?

27:15.176 --> 27:16.886
So, I'm gonna beat the screws
out of those junkers,

27:17.136 --> 27:19.138
and the two of us are gonna
get the hell out of Dodge.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.475
- Deal?
- Deal.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.150
Agent Fitz
is in critical condition.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.986
He might survive, but it gives us an idea
of what these two are...

27:36.906 --> 27:37.948
...capable of.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.725
They're gassing the agents.

28:05.101 --> 28:07.144
- Smart.
- We should kill the lights.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.313
They can't see in the dark
as well as we can.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.774
And I'll get Agent May ready
for the contingency plan.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.947
Explosives? They trying to bring
the roof down on us? Is that it?

28:20.449 --> 28:21.492
No.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.537
That's not it.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.256
What's going on down there?
Is everyone okay?

28:35.548 --> 28:38.843
It's time for you to enter the fight.
You're our last line of defence.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.470
What do you want me to do?

29:46.243 --> 29:48.913
You guys all right?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.665
There's still gas everywhere.
How are we awake?

29:57.630 --> 29:59.215
Daisy and I aren't the LMDs.

29:59.882 --> 30:00.883
I don't buy it.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.344
I don't care.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.095
Now get up.

30:20.277 --> 30:24.657
Really?
Not even winded?

30:24.990 --> 30:26.367
We don't want to hurt you.

30:28.536 --> 30:29.787
That's not what it feels like.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.816
Ah!

31:00.109 --> 31:01.819
Ah!

31:02.152 --> 31:06.532
Daisy, this is for your own good.

31:07.074 --> 31:10.578
We didn't want to hurt you,
but we have no choice here.

31:11.954 --> 31:14.331
Now let us download you
before you bleed out.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.166
Don't resist us.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.085
You'll be fine.

31:20.629 --> 31:21.672
We're in this together.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.967
We're a team.

31:47.615 --> 31:51.118
I would say I told you so, but...
I don't have to now.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.957
Okay, okay.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.461
Anyone here know how to fly the <i>Zephyr?</i>

32:03.213 --> 32:07.092
- I... I just started training.
- Okay. Well, you're gonna try real hard.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.595
You three can walk better than we can,

32:09.970 --> 32:12.389
so drag any unconscious bodies
out of this sector

32:12.556 --> 32:13.557
before the fire spreads,

32:13.641 --> 32:15.935
then open the hangar doors
and meet us on the <i>Zephyr.</i>

32:16.560 --> 32:18.145
Daisy and I will load in this hardware.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.690
And remember,
anyone you see who's awake...

32:21.857 --> 32:24.735
Is a robot. Super. Come on.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.532
I need medical.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.683
Coulson, I have them.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.861
May, think about what you're doing.

33:08.946 --> 33:09.947
I am.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.075
Or... processing, I should say.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.453
Please. Do you want us to die?

33:16.787 --> 33:18.288
Coulson says that doesn't matter.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.249
That doesn't sound like Coulson.

33:22.835 --> 33:23.836
Either way...

33:25.879 --> 33:27.715
I won't have to regret this decision.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.933
- This'll take a while.
- Worry about Mack later.

33:38.475 --> 33:41.812
Can you program the Daisy fleet downstairs
with basic seek-and-destroy?

33:42.062 --> 33:44.523
- Of course.
- Do it. Be ready to release them.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.616
I thought you said you had them.

33:56.994 --> 33:57.995
May?

33:59.496 --> 34:00.539
What did you do?

34:01.290 --> 34:02.458
What I wanted to.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.089
Okay.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.050
Everything's under control.

34:11.341 --> 34:12.509
- Let's just...
- Whose control?

34:14.553 --> 34:18.014
Why don't you and I
have a glass of Scotch... or many,

34:18.474 --> 34:20.476
and talk this out, like we always do?

34:21.226 --> 34:24.146
"We"? We've never done that before.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.326
Oh, Daisy!

34:37.951 --> 34:41.246
You were right.
Our programming is different.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.583
Are you afraid to die?

34:45.626 --> 34:46.668
'Cause I am.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.388
I know I'm not real.
I'm all phantom limbs.

34:58.972 --> 35:02.810
- But that doesn't make the pain less real.
- You don't have to feel pain.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.937
You say you don't anymore.

35:05.896 --> 35:08.273
But that pain... that regret...

35:10.025 --> 35:11.527
that's what made you a person...

35:13.028 --> 35:14.363
a person I love.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.698
Start engine. Ignition on.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.411
- Go, go, go!
- Top right. Move it! Top right.

35:22.371 --> 35:23.747
Come on, go, go, go, go, go!

35:32.172 --> 35:34.925
My programming was to get the Darkhold.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.052
That came from Radcliffe.

35:38.971 --> 35:43.433
But my impulse,
to keep Coulson safe and close...

35:44.351 --> 35:45.352
that desire...

35:47.354 --> 35:48.480
that came from me.

35:49.898 --> 35:50.983
That's good.

35:52.734 --> 35:53.944
And I'm sorry to say...

35:55.362 --> 35:56.405
you're not him.

36:39.448 --> 36:42.534
What we can decipher
from the insane amount of code

36:42.701 --> 36:45.370
flying around in there
is that it's a duplicate of our world.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.831
Populated with all the people
in the world.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.833
- How could they build...
- The Darkhold.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.671
We've managed to identify
the duplicate avatars of myself

36:54.796 --> 36:56.215
and Daisy that are
running around in there.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.051
So, you just plug yourself
into these avatars?

36:59.218 --> 37:00.969
Hook up with our people
and find out where on Earth

37:01.053 --> 37:02.888
- their bodies are being held.
- And rescue them.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.266
That sounds easy. Will it be easy?

37:10.687 --> 37:13.148
- They have no idea.
- And if they're in there too long,

37:13.482 --> 37:15.776
their bodies will... give out.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.444
Well, that's the hypothesis.

37:19.613 --> 37:22.532
So, we have to go... now.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.079
Meet at the rendezvous right away.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.789
That's where I programmed
the backdoor to get out.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.334
And listen, living in there too long
may kill you,

37:32.793 --> 37:34.586
but dying in there
will definitely kill you, so...

37:35.671 --> 37:36.672
be careful.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.174
You, too.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.807
And remember, even if our vitals
are going haywire, do not...

37:46.974 --> 37:48.809
Do not pull you out
or wake you up, I know.

37:49.059 --> 37:51.103
It will cook your brains
like <i>huevos rotos.</i>

37:51.270 --> 37:54.064
Cause permanent damage
to the cerebral cortex, yes.

37:55.857 --> 37:58.193
Just promise me you'll get
our guys back, okay?

37:58.902 --> 37:59.903
I promise.

38:54.416 --> 38:55.417
Lincoln?

41:00.625 --> 41:02.836
See? Good as new.

41:05.589 --> 41:08.133
- And stronger, it seems.
- I know what you did.

41:08.550 --> 41:11.344
You stole my mind
and uploaded it to a filthy machine.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.265
- I told you not to mess with my mind.
- I assure you...

41:18.143 --> 41:20.687
your mind is alive and well
inside your head...

41:22.898 --> 41:23.899
untouched.

41:29.279 --> 41:32.157
This body is mechanical... yes.

41:34.201 --> 41:35.368
What?

41:39.080 --> 41:40.582
You're controlling it remotely.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.671
Some reading, if you're interested.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.427
I need you walking around...

41:53.512 --> 41:55.680
able to continue protecting the Framework.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.934
A perfect machine, controlled with a mind

41:59.100 --> 42:04.147
endowed with the ability
to feel love, anger, wonder...

42:06.316 --> 42:07.317
joy.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.157
Joy?

42:16.284 --> 42:17.327
When?

42:19.496 --> 42:22.040
When I am able
to feel those things myself.
