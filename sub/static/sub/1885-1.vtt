00:53.740 --> 00:55.364
Where is he?

00:56.201 --> 00:58.691
I shan't ask you politely next time.

01:02.790 --> 01:04.617
Where is Blofeld?

01:04.751 --> 01:06.293
Cai... Cai...

01:06.419 --> 01:07.996
Cairo!

01:10.881 --> 01:12.256
Cards.

01:14.009 --> 01:15.752
Hit me.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.805
One chance.

01:21.933 --> 01:23.760
Where can I find him?

01:23.894 --> 01:25.352
Marie...

01:25.478 --> 01:26.972
Ask Marie.

01:27.105 --> 01:28.563
Who are you?

01:30.983 --> 01:33.900
My name is Bond. James Bond.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.435
Is there something I can do for you?

01:36.571 --> 01:39.323
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

01:39.449 --> 01:42.819
There is something I'd like you
to get off your chest.

01:47.499 --> 01:49.824
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?

01:51.210 --> 01:53.167
Speak up, darling. I can't hear you.

01:54.213 --> 01:57.297
We now come to phase four: The nose.

01:57.424 --> 02:02.087
In my opinion, the most difficult part
of a plastic transformation.

02:02.221 --> 02:04.344
I want the operation done tonight.

02:04.473 --> 02:06.715
- But, señor...
- There's no time left.

02:06.850 --> 02:10.100
But, Señor Blofeld,
this is a most delicate procedure.

02:10.228 --> 02:12.055
Tonight!

02:23.324 --> 02:26.325
Keep the temperature
at precisely 80 degrees.

03:36.475 --> 03:38.598
Making mud pies, 007?

03:43.607 --> 03:46.145
He would have been me
in a matter of days

03:46.276 --> 03:48.849
if you'd given the poor fellow a chance.

03:48.987 --> 03:52.521
Such a pity. I was dying to see
how the operation turned out.

03:52.657 --> 03:54.696
Get his gun.

03:55.493 --> 03:57.983
Hold it! Get your hands up.

04:12.008 --> 04:13.633
Kill him!

04:45.707 --> 04:47.366
Welcome to hell, Blofeld.

07:47.584 --> 07:49.624
Star of South Africa.

07:49.753 --> 07:51.793
83.5 carats rough.

07:51.923 --> 07:53.998
47.5 carats cut.

07:54.133 --> 07:57.217
The Akbar Shah. 116 carats rough.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.718
Are you paying attention, 007?

08:00.847 --> 08:02.970
The Akbar Shah, 116 carats rough.

08:04.058 --> 08:07.723
But surely, sir, there's no need
to bring in our section

08:07.853 --> 08:10.688
on a relatively simple smuggling matter.

08:10.815 --> 08:13.388
Sir Donald has convinced the PM
otherwise.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.277
May I remind you, 007,
that Blofeld's dead.

08:16.404 --> 08:17.898
Finished!

08:18.030 --> 08:22.359
The least we can expect from you now
is a little plain, solid work.

08:23.451 --> 08:25.076
Good morning, gentlemen.

08:25.203 --> 08:28.369
- Sir Donald will see you now.
- Thank you.

08:28.498 --> 08:30.206
Good morning, Sir Donald.

08:30.333 --> 08:34.034
- This is Commander Bond.
- How do you do? Please sit down.

08:34.169 --> 08:37.254
- Sherry?
- Not for me, thanks. Doctor's orders.

08:37.381 --> 08:39.587
- Commander Bond?
- Yes, thank you.

08:39.717 --> 08:42.836
You've been on holiday, I understand.

08:42.970 --> 08:45.009
Relaxing, I hope.

08:45.138 --> 08:48.055
Hardly relaxing but... most satisfying.

08:48.183 --> 08:50.223
Cheers.

08:52.145 --> 08:55.894
Pity about your liver, sir.
It's an unusually fine Solera.

08:56.024 --> 09:00.151
- '51, I believe.
- There is no year for sherry, 007.

09:00.278 --> 09:05.520
I was referring to the original vintage
on which the sherry is based, sir.

09:06.617 --> 09:08.443
1851.

09:09.662 --> 09:11.286
Unmistakable.

09:11.413 --> 09:13.205
Precisely.

09:13.332 --> 09:15.241
Tell me, Commander.

09:15.375 --> 09:19.242
How far does your expertise extend
into the field of diamonds?

09:19.379 --> 09:24.170
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.715
They've replaced a dog
as a girl's best friend. That's about it.

09:27.845 --> 09:31.261
Refreshing to hear there's one subject
you're not an expert on.

09:31.390 --> 09:36.135
Perhaps I'd better give you
a brief background into our problem.

09:36.270 --> 09:41.097
Eighty per cent of the world's diamonds
come from mines in South Africa.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.850
Most are dug out of shafts
of diamond-bearing clay

09:44.986 --> 09:46.729
at depths of up to 3,000 feet.

09:46.862 --> 09:52.403
The whole process, from start to finish,
is subject to an airtight security system.

09:52.535 --> 09:54.574
It's an essential precaution,

09:54.704 --> 09:58.950
though the industry prides itself on
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.

10:00.459 --> 10:04.705
Naturally the security measures
tend to ensure that loyalty,

10:04.838 --> 10:08.918
as do the extensive amenities
and social services we provide.

10:09.051 --> 10:11.885
There's a permanent staff
of doctors, nurses,

10:12.012 --> 10:13.554
even dentists.

10:13.680 --> 10:18.306
The whole process, from start to finish,
is subject to an airtight security system.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.976
It's a necessary precaution,

10:20.102 --> 10:23.934
though the industry prides itself on
the loyalty and devotion of its workers.

10:24.064 --> 10:25.060
Next!

10:30.571 --> 10:32.978
The scorpion.

10:33.114 --> 10:35.652
Mother nature's finest killer, Mr. Wint.

10:35.784 --> 10:39.282
One is never too old
to learn from a master, Mr. Kidd.

11:03.017 --> 11:05.342
Dr. Tynan? Good evening.

11:05.477 --> 11:07.601
Who are you? And where is Joe?

11:07.730 --> 11:09.770
Joe couldn't make it tonight.

11:09.899 --> 11:11.726
I'm Mr. Wint.

11:11.859 --> 11:13.686
This is Mr. Kidd.

11:16.488 --> 11:18.527
I see.

11:33.421 --> 11:35.460
What's the matter with him?

11:35.589 --> 11:38.590
It's my wisdom teeth.
I haven't had 'em out yet.

11:38.717 --> 11:41.006
Would you mind having a look, Doctor?

11:41.136 --> 11:42.678
Of course.

11:42.804 --> 11:44.963
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.

11:45.099 --> 11:47.138
No, no. Open wide.

11:59.528 --> 12:01.567
Curious

12:01.697 --> 12:05.446
how everyone who touches
those diamonds seems to... die.

12:19.422 --> 12:22.458
- Stop right there! Who are you?
- Dr. Tynan sent us.

12:22.591 --> 12:25.676
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.

12:25.803 --> 12:27.843
Bitten by the bug.

12:27.972 --> 12:30.011
He sent this for you.

12:41.609 --> 12:43.649
If God had wanted man to fly...

12:43.778 --> 12:47.610
He would have given him wings, Mr. Kidd.

12:57.249 --> 12:59.918
No security system is perfect.

13:00.043 --> 13:03.128
We've always accepted
a percentage of smuggling.

13:03.255 --> 13:08.212
But over the past two years, despite all
our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.

13:08.343 --> 13:11.178
And none of the stones
have reached the market.

13:11.304 --> 13:13.877
Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.

13:14.014 --> 13:19.174
Our concern is that someone might dump
them on the market to depress prices or...

13:19.311 --> 13:21.885
Make you agree to perpetual blackmail.

13:22.023 --> 13:23.647
Exactly.

13:25.234 --> 13:27.771
What we need to know is

13:27.903 --> 13:30.607
who the stockpilers are.

13:30.739 --> 13:32.363
The letter U

13:32.490 --> 13:34.317
is for umbrella.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.489
We take it lest it rain.

13:36.619 --> 13:38.741
We hope we shan't want it

13:38.871 --> 13:40.910
till we're home again.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.080
Two men to see you, missy.

13:43.209 --> 13:45.248
Gentlemen, Joshua.

13:45.377 --> 13:49.375
I shan't be long, children.
Joshua is going to read you a story.

13:50.757 --> 13:52.796
How nice to see you again!

13:53.885 --> 13:56.008
- Where to this time?
- Amsterdam.

13:56.137 --> 13:58.176
Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely!

13:58.306 --> 14:02.553
I shall have to bring back some pictures
of the canals for the children.

14:02.685 --> 14:05.472
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs. Whistler.

14:08.649 --> 14:12.100
Thus endeth the lesson
for today, gentlemen.

14:12.235 --> 14:16.363
Several recent murders in South Africa
have complicated matters.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.692
If they shut down operations
before we discover them...

14:19.827 --> 14:21.866
It would be catastrophic for us

14:21.995 --> 14:24.071
and for the government.

14:24.205 --> 14:28.250
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.

14:29.710 --> 14:33.293
For some time we've had our eyes
on a smuggler - Peter Franks.

14:33.422 --> 14:35.414
He's due to leave for Amsterdam.

14:35.549 --> 14:37.541
Do we know who his contacts are?

14:37.676 --> 14:40.761
We do function
in your absence, Commander.

14:45.308 --> 14:47.348
Passport, sir?

14:49.479 --> 14:53.393
Mr. Franks. There's a message
for you at Passport Control.

14:53.524 --> 14:56.193
That door over there.
You can park outside.

14:56.318 --> 14:57.942
Thank you.

15:25.137 --> 15:26.133
Mr. Franks...

15:26.263 --> 15:28.386
Your passport is quite in order.

15:28.515 --> 15:31.302
Anyone seeing you
in that outfit, Moneypenny,

15:31.434 --> 15:34.637
would certainly be discouraged
from leaving the country.

15:34.771 --> 15:36.893
What can I bring you back from Holland?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.683
A diamond?

15:38.817 --> 15:40.441
In a ring?

15:43.863 --> 15:46.105
Would you settle for a tulip?

15:47.992 --> 15:49.190
Yes.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.837
Ahead is one of
the oldest bridges in Amsterdam.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.883
The Skinny Bridge.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.058
It was built over 300 years ago

16:18.187 --> 16:21.306
by two sisters who wanted
to visit each other every day.

16:21.440 --> 16:26.232
Unfortunately they ran out of money. So
that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.112
On your right,
those beautiful old houses

16:29.238 --> 16:33.022
can be seen in the paintings
of our famous painter, Rembrandt.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.198
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

16:35.327 --> 16:39.705
if you will look to your left
as we go down the Amstel, you can see...

16:49.424 --> 16:53.753
Mrs. Whistler did want some pictures
of the canals for the children.

16:53.886 --> 16:56.508
How kind of you, Mr. Kidd.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.177
The children will be so thrilled.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.540
Yes?

17:25.665 --> 17:27.704
Franks. Peter Franks.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.542
Come up. Third floor.

17:47.520 --> 17:51.138
Make yourself at home!
I'll be out in a minute!

17:55.194 --> 17:57.233
Help yourself to a drink!

17:58.364 --> 18:00.403
Is Mr. Case not at home?

18:00.532 --> 18:04.031
There is no Mr. Case. The T is for Tiffany.

18:05.787 --> 18:07.826
Tiffany Case?

18:07.955 --> 18:09.995
Definitely distinctive.

18:10.124 --> 18:12.413
I was born there, on the first floor,

18:12.543 --> 18:15.414
while my mother was
looking for a wedding ring.

18:15.546 --> 18:18.915
I'm glad for your sake
it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.

18:23.011 --> 18:24.803
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.507
Could be.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.218
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.

18:32.354 --> 18:34.393
And which do you prefer?

18:35.482 --> 18:38.151
Providing the collars and cuffs match...

18:38.276 --> 18:40.315
We'll talk about that later.

18:40.444 --> 18:42.484
Let me have your glass.

18:42.613 --> 18:44.652
I'll get you some ice.

19:13.476 --> 19:17.639
That's quite a nice little nothing
you're almost wearing. I approve.

19:17.771 --> 19:19.810
I don't dress for the hired help.

19:19.940 --> 19:22.062
Let's see your passport, Franks.

19:26.112 --> 19:28.318
Occupation: Transport consultant?

19:28.447 --> 19:30.071
That's a little cute, isn't it?

19:30.199 --> 19:33.948
- I'll finish dressing.
- Please don't. Not on my account.

20:16.117 --> 20:19.320
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.

20:19.453 --> 20:21.493
But somehow it seems to suit you.

20:21.622 --> 20:23.661
It's my own.

20:23.791 --> 20:26.032
But it is in need of some soft lighting.

20:26.168 --> 20:30.000
- I know a little restaurant...
- I never mix business with pleasure.

20:30.131 --> 20:32.004
- Neither do I.
- Good!

20:32.132 --> 20:37.090
Then save the cute remarks until after
you get the diamonds into Los Angeles.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.304
- Where are they now?
- That's not your problem.

20:40.431 --> 20:42.388
Your problem is getting them in.

20:42.516 --> 20:44.972
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.

20:45.102 --> 20:50.523
At 142 carats an ounce, that's
an awful lot of ice. That won't be easy.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.105
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.

20:53.235 --> 20:56.770
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?

20:56.905 --> 21:01.199
And, Franks, for God's sakes,
come up with something original.

21:06.747 --> 21:10.081
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.

21:10.210 --> 21:13.874
An obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.

21:14.005 --> 21:18.962
M's been trying to get in touch with you.
That Peter Franks fellow's escaped.

21:19.092 --> 21:21.927
Killed one of the guards
on the way up to London.

21:23.138 --> 21:24.133
Hello?

21:25.640 --> 21:26.636
Hello!

21:26.766 --> 21:28.806
Are you there?

21:49.663 --> 21:51.702
- Yes?
- Peter Franks.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.871
Third floor.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.040
- Guten Abend.
- Good evening.

21:57.378 --> 21:58.872
Bitte.

22:00.006 --> 22:02.377
- You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.

22:03.467 --> 22:05.506
I speak English.

22:08.055 --> 22:10.546
- Who is... your floor?
- Three, please.

24:36.276 --> 24:37.984
Is he dead?

24:38.111 --> 24:40.151
I sincerely hope so.

24:47.746 --> 24:49.785
- Who is he?
- No idea.

24:49.914 --> 24:52.950
This chap's been following me
all day today.

24:57.171 --> 24:58.581
My God!

25:00.967 --> 25:03.292
You've just killed James Bond!

25:07.222 --> 25:09.262
Is that who it was?

25:09.391 --> 25:12.345
It just proves no one's indestructible.

25:12.477 --> 25:16.177
You don't kill James Bond and
wait around for the cops to arrive!

25:16.314 --> 25:19.148
We've got to get those diamonds
out of here fast!

25:19.275 --> 25:20.900
Where are they?

25:23.112 --> 25:26.563
A little old lady dropped them by
yesterday morning.

25:28.367 --> 25:29.991
Priceless.

25:32.579 --> 25:36.327
I think we ought to let Mr. Bond
carry the load from here on out.

25:49.303 --> 25:50.927
It's funny.

25:51.055 --> 25:55.348
All the things one wanted to say
to one's brother... when it's all too late.

25:55.475 --> 25:58.180
Let me assure you
of our deepest condolences.

25:58.311 --> 26:00.684
Would you please board the aircraft?

26:03.233 --> 26:06.602
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr. Franks.

26:08.238 --> 26:14.441
Lufthansa announce the departure
of flight LH450 to Los Angeles.

26:18.121 --> 26:21.870
Please fasten your seat belts,
and no smoking until airborne.

26:22.001 --> 26:23.625
Thank you.

26:25.712 --> 26:29.579
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.

26:29.716 --> 26:31.755
For a lady.

26:37.556 --> 26:43.143
Lufthansa announce the arrival
of flight LH450 from Amsterdam...

26:43.270 --> 26:45.310
- Mr. Franks?
- Yes.

26:45.439 --> 26:47.478
Follow me to Customs, please.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.525
Peter Franks, Jerry.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.744
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.956
Death certificate, please, Mr. Franks.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.088
Well, well, well!
Felix Leiter, you old fraud.

27:16.592 --> 27:19.167
On behalf of the CIA,
welcome to America.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.848
Someone sent their brain trust
down to meet you.

27:32.232 --> 27:35.268
I give up. I know
the diamonds are in the body,

27:35.402 --> 27:37.194
but where?

27:37.321 --> 27:39.360
Alimentary, Dr. Leiter.

27:42.701 --> 27:44.740
So long, James. Keep in touch.

27:45.829 --> 27:50.573
The rest of your luggage
has been cleared, Mr. Franks. OK, fellas!

28:12.603 --> 28:15.273
You wanna sit in the front, Mr. Franks?

28:15.398 --> 28:18.269
It's a lot smoother ride
in the front, Mr. Franks.

28:18.401 --> 28:20.773
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.

28:41.756 --> 28:45.504
The stiff - deceased back there.

28:45.634 --> 28:47.674
Your brother, Mr. Franks?

28:47.803 --> 28:49.842
Yes, it was.

28:49.972 --> 28:52.011
I got a brudder.

28:54.685 --> 28:56.309
Small world.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.831
Mr. Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.

29:21.960 --> 29:26.420
Please accept my heartfelt condolences
at this most difficult hour.

29:26.547 --> 29:29.750
He is heading
for a better world, Mr. Slumber.

29:29.884 --> 29:32.090
There is some consolation in that.

29:32.971 --> 29:36.422
Now then, if we're ready
to begin the final journey...

30:11.005 --> 30:12.666
May his soul rest in peace.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.210
Oh, yes. Amen.

30:14.343 --> 30:18.387
If you'd come into my comfortable office,
we will bring you the urn.

30:18.513 --> 30:22.641
I'm so happy you chose our half-couch,
hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.

30:22.767 --> 30:25.767
I'm sure your brother
would have appreciated it.

30:25.894 --> 30:27.934
I'm sure he did.

30:28.063 --> 30:30.102
Please, be seated.

30:53.963 --> 30:56.002
Ashes to ashes...

30:56.924 --> 30:58.963
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.

30:59.092 --> 31:03.339
At a moment like this, I'm sure
you'd rather be left alone, for reflection.

31:03.471 --> 31:05.013
Most thoughtful.

31:05.139 --> 31:09.267
We've selected a private niche for your
brother in our Garden of Remembrance.

31:09.393 --> 31:13.522
The one with the restful chartreuse
curtains and Angel's Breath gold trim.

31:13.648 --> 31:15.687
I hope you'll find everything in order.

31:15.817 --> 31:18.142
The arrangements
have been impeccable

31:18.277 --> 31:19.688
so far.

32:39.895 --> 32:41.934
Very... moving.

32:42.063 --> 32:44.103
Heart-warming, Mr. Wint.

32:44.232 --> 32:46.271
A glowing tribute, Mr. Kidd.

33:35.947 --> 33:40.443
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink!
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies!

33:44.246 --> 33:46.489
No, don't tell me. You're St. Peter?

33:46.624 --> 33:49.293
Paste! Glass!
Where's the real stuff, Franks?

33:49.418 --> 33:53.712
Where's the real money? You wouldn't
burn 50,000 real dollars, would you?

33:53.839 --> 33:56.508
One last break.
Where are the real diamonds?

33:56.633 --> 33:58.672
You get me the real money

33:58.802 --> 34:01.257
and I'll bring you the real diamonds.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.427
Where do you think you're goin'?

34:03.556 --> 34:06.723
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana
is quite comfortable.

34:06.851 --> 34:08.891
My condolences, gentlemen.

34:09.896 --> 34:11.224
Hello, Felix.

34:11.355 --> 34:13.929
Very comfortable.
But there's one problem.

34:14.065 --> 34:16.639
I want the real merchandise -
rather quickly.

34:16.777 --> 34:20.311
Q has just arrived with it.
We'll be up with them in the morning.

34:20.447 --> 34:24.574
So I'd sit tight if I were you.
There's no sense in looking for trouble.

34:24.702 --> 34:27.904
Just enjoy yourself, James.
I'm sure you know how.

34:28.038 --> 34:30.077
Quite. I'll probably take in a show.

35:12.954 --> 35:15.196
How do you like me so far?

35:15.332 --> 35:17.869
People say I have
the body of Rock Hudson.

35:18.001 --> 35:21.914
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it,
he'll be madder than hell.

35:22.046 --> 35:23.790
I call these girls my Acorns.

35:23.923 --> 35:28.549
Actually, they're a gift from Willard Whyte,
who is upstairs right now

35:28.678 --> 35:31.512
playing Monopoly with real buildings.

35:32.097 --> 35:37.683
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like
tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.

35:37.811 --> 35:41.642
On behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know

35:41.774 --> 35:43.813
you've been a lousy audience.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.981
So get lost. See ya later.

36:05.921 --> 36:07.960
Shady Tree!

36:10.508 --> 36:14.126
- Shady, we just adored your act!
- What taste, style!

36:14.262 --> 36:16.337
And we have a few suggestions.

36:16.472 --> 36:20.600
Critics and material I don't need!
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.

36:25.773 --> 36:28.394
Hold it! Don't go in there.

36:30.110 --> 36:33.977
We didn't get the real diamonds,
so we need Tree - alive.

36:34.113 --> 36:36.153
That's most annoying.

36:54.341 --> 36:57.923
- Get down there!
- Crap. Boxcar, the loser.

36:58.052 --> 37:01.137
That's it, pussycat.
I shot the whole wad.

37:01.264 --> 37:03.304
What do you say? Back to my place?

37:03.433 --> 37:06.433
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.

37:06.561 --> 37:10.060
Why don't you go and take a nap?
And I'll see you next year.

37:11.357 --> 37:14.227
May I have $5,000? No, make it $10,000.

37:14.359 --> 37:15.853
$2,000 limit.

37:19.198 --> 37:21.190
Is there some problem?

37:21.325 --> 37:23.364
Mr. Saxby.

37:23.493 --> 37:27.325
Gentleman wants $10,000 credit
with a $2,000 limit.

37:27.455 --> 37:29.613
My name is Franks.

37:29.749 --> 37:31.907
Peter Franks.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.498
Mr. Franks' credit's good.

37:34.628 --> 37:38.294
- Good luck to you, Mr. Franks.
- Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.

37:39.759 --> 37:41.798
Give the gentleman 4,000.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.588
Thank you.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.761
Hi! I'm Plenty.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.381
- But of course you are.
- Plenty O'Toole.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.516
Named after your father, perhaps?

37:52.645 --> 37:55.599
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.771
That's very kind of you.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.193
Coming out. Coming out.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.523
Next shooter is a lady.
Ladies are lucky. For the lady.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.066
Nine. Mark nine.

38:13.206 --> 38:15.743
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.

38:17.752 --> 38:19.460
New shooter. Your shot, Mr. F.

38:26.927 --> 38:31.553
- Willard Whyte speakin'.
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.

38:34.559 --> 38:36.599
It's Peter Franks.

38:40.023 --> 38:41.766
Hard ten. Ten's the number.

38:41.900 --> 38:45.268
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.

38:45.486 --> 38:50.029
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.

38:50.157 --> 38:53.193
Say! You've played this game before!

38:53.327 --> 38:55.366
Just once.

38:56.580 --> 38:59.914
- Now what do we do?
- Don't bother me with details, Bert!

39:00.042 --> 39:01.999
Just get me the diamonds!

39:06.756 --> 39:10.884
You handle those cubes
like a monkey handles coconuts.

39:11.010 --> 39:14.877
Thank you, gentlemen,
for such a sterling service.

39:15.013 --> 39:17.054
That's 50,000 dollars!

39:17.183 --> 39:21.476
Minus $5,000 for you... leaves me
$45,000, and thank you very much.

39:21.603 --> 39:23.643
It was nothing, really!

39:24.398 --> 39:28.311
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy!

39:28.443 --> 39:30.649
A little weird, but a terrific guy!

39:30.778 --> 39:33.565
Why don't we go someplace
and have a drink?

39:33.697 --> 39:34.896
A drink?

39:38.077 --> 39:40.117
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.

39:40.246 --> 39:43.661
How pretty!
What a super place you have!

40:03.142 --> 40:05.181
Just give me one second, lover.

40:15.863 --> 40:17.487
Good evening.

40:22.368 --> 40:25.404
I'm afraid you've caught me
with more than my hands up.

40:25.538 --> 40:29.665
What the hell is this?!
A perverts' convention or something?!

40:29.792 --> 40:31.701
You can't do this to me!

40:31.835 --> 40:35.287
Stop that! I've got friends in this town!

40:42.429 --> 40:44.468
Exceptionally fine shot.

40:45.932 --> 40:48.505
I didn't know there was
a pool down there.

40:52.187 --> 40:56.055
Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...

40:57.735 --> 40:59.562
The real diamonds.

41:16.836 --> 41:19.078
Good evening, Miss Case.

41:24.885 --> 41:27.554
Sorry about your fulsome friend.

41:27.679 --> 41:30.348
I'll bet you really missed something.

41:30.473 --> 41:33.890
The evening may not be
a total loss after all.

41:34.019 --> 41:36.723
Why don't we talk a bit first?

41:36.855 --> 41:38.894
First?

41:39.023 --> 41:41.894
What would you like to talk about?

41:43.194 --> 41:45.233
You pick a subject.

41:45.362 --> 41:47.604
- Diamonds?
- Good boy!

41:48.740 --> 41:53.284
And you want to know where they are,
and whether I'm working alone or not.

41:53.412 --> 41:55.867
So far, so good. Keep going.

41:55.998 --> 41:59.247
And if not, then with whom.

41:59.626 --> 42:02.117
So you can inform your superiors and...

42:03.337 --> 42:05.377
acquire the diamonds.

42:05.506 --> 42:06.917
Peter!

42:07.049 --> 42:09.088
I'm very impressed.

42:09.218 --> 42:12.385
There's a lot more to you
than I had expected.

42:12.513 --> 42:15.218
Presumably I'm the condemned man,

42:15.349 --> 42:18.433
and obviously you're the hearty breakfast.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.841
Right?

42:22.897 --> 42:26.646
You're not going to tell me
where the diamonds are, are you?

42:26.818 --> 42:28.857
What diamonds?

42:28.986 --> 42:31.276
Sooner or later you'll have to talk.

42:31.406 --> 42:33.445
They'll make you.

42:33.574 --> 42:36.943
At the very least, you'll never
get out of town alive.

42:38.871 --> 42:40.910
I can solve that little problem.

42:43.917 --> 42:46.621
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.

42:48.338 --> 42:50.794
Fifty-fifty split.

42:51.883 --> 42:54.374
You get the diamonds, I get us out.

42:54.511 --> 42:56.053
Us?

42:56.179 --> 42:59.594
I can't very well help you
and then stick around.

42:59.724 --> 43:03.555
We could be on a plane and
out of the country by tomorrow night.

43:03.685 --> 43:06.520
Rio... Hong Kong...

43:06.646 --> 43:08.687
I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.

43:08.816 --> 43:10.855
Hong Kong.

43:11.652 --> 43:15.566
All right. I'll get the diamonds,
you get the plane tickets.

43:15.697 --> 43:17.736
No. The airport's too obvious.

43:17.866 --> 43:20.535
A rented car should
do us fine for openers.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.699
That's good thinking.

43:22.828 --> 43:27.989
And since you're the one being watched,
I'll get the diamonds, you get the car.

43:28.126 --> 43:30.165
That's very good thinking.

43:30.294 --> 43:32.251
Oh, Peter!

43:32.379 --> 43:36.922
I have a feeling this is the beginning
of a wonderful relationship.

43:45.099 --> 43:47.555
Darling...

43:47.686 --> 43:49.725
Where do I pick up the diamonds?

43:50.897 --> 43:54.941
When was the last time
you visited a circus?

43:56.568 --> 43:58.608
Circus Circus proudly presents

43:58.737 --> 44:01.524
the Flying Palacios!

44:26.639 --> 44:29.212
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.

44:29.349 --> 44:33.181
James, next time, pick a contact point
when you're standing up.

44:33.311 --> 44:37.854
- Felix, if she gives your men the slip...
- Relax. I have 30 agents down there.

44:37.982 --> 44:40.686
A mouse with sneakers on
couldn't get through.

45:04.673 --> 45:06.963
Give Maxwell his cue.

45:07.093 --> 45:08.468
This is Quarterback.

45:08.594 --> 45:10.634
Operation Passover, commence.

45:10.763 --> 45:12.802
Quarterback to Tight End.

45:12.931 --> 45:15.090
Operation Passover, commence.

45:16.059 --> 45:17.886
Roger.

45:48.673 --> 45:50.998
She's on her way. So far, so good.

45:51.134 --> 45:54.585
- Good luck, Felix. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?

45:54.720 --> 45:56.843
The car rental agency.

45:56.972 --> 45:59.178
Our little rendezvous?

45:59.308 --> 46:03.306
You don't actually think she'll show up?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.

46:03.437 --> 46:05.062
No, more like even money.

46:05.189 --> 46:09.233
Her devotion to larceny
versus my... incomparable charm.

46:16.157 --> 46:19.241
All right, kiddies!
Ready? Aim! Fire!

46:21.620 --> 46:25.120
What did I tell you?
Didn't I promise you a winner every time?

46:25.249 --> 46:27.289
There you are, young man.

46:27.418 --> 46:32.163
Boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...

46:32.297 --> 46:35.915
Here we have a little lady,
here we have a little man,

46:36.050 --> 46:38.090
and here we have a big lady.

46:38.219 --> 46:41.422
You're a little out of your league,
aren't ya, sister?

46:41.555 --> 46:43.513
Point the gun. You know what to do.

46:43.641 --> 46:45.717
All ready? Get set.

46:45.852 --> 46:48.010
Now hold it till I say go.

46:48.145 --> 46:48.810
Go!

46:49.897 --> 46:51.640
Come on! That's it!

46:51.774 --> 46:55.356
Everybody point right at the clown.
A winner every time!

46:57.487 --> 47:00.274
There we are! All right!
That's the way to do it!

47:02.159 --> 47:05.243
Look at that!
And we have another winner!

47:07.413 --> 47:09.655
Annie Oakley on the end!

47:09.791 --> 47:13.241
Here we are. What an eye! What an eye!

47:13.377 --> 47:16.046
Wait a second!
I saw the whole thing!

47:16.171 --> 47:18.709
The machine's fixed!
Who's she - your mother?

47:18.840 --> 47:20.879
Blow up your pants!

47:22.845 --> 47:25.051
One win! She only had one win!

47:25.180 --> 47:27.753
You're supposed to have 24
to win that dog!

47:27.891 --> 47:29.930
Will you give it a rest, kid?

47:30.059 --> 47:32.467
All right, boys and girls! Here we go!

48:02.674 --> 48:07.833
Here for the first time, see Zambora,
strangest girl ever born to live.

48:07.970 --> 48:10.840
She was captured
near Nairobi, south Africa,

48:10.973 --> 48:14.673
and is believed to be part of a cruel,
inhuman experiment.

48:14.809 --> 48:18.889
This beautiful girl
will be locked into a steel cage,

48:19.021 --> 48:23.518
will change very slowly
into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla.

48:24.861 --> 48:28.525
Please be very still, ladies and gentlemen.

48:28.656 --> 48:30.695
We must have absolute silence

48:30.824 --> 48:34.738
so we wouldn't disturb Zambora
from her transcendental state.

48:34.870 --> 48:38.369
We must warn you that
in every scientific experiment

48:38.498 --> 48:40.491
there's always a danger.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.199
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.

48:43.336 --> 48:47.499
God forbid something should go wrong
over here, get outta here!

48:50.718 --> 48:53.043
Now we start the transformation.

48:53.178 --> 48:56.464
Very dangerous. Very quiet, please.

49:24.166 --> 49:26.205
Wake, my beauty, wake!

49:39.889 --> 49:42.345
Hey, lady, not through there.
The other way.

49:45.186 --> 49:46.810
Come on!

50:10.501 --> 50:13.170
- No show?
- Felix, don't tell me you lost her?

50:13.295 --> 50:15.038
We lost her.

50:24.389 --> 50:26.428
Nice place you have here.

50:26.557 --> 50:28.680
Take something off. Enjoy the sun.

50:28.809 --> 50:31.217
You've got a lot of guts showing up here!

50:31.353 --> 50:34.936
Letting me freeze my behind off
at a blackjack table for two hours

50:35.065 --> 50:37.272
waiting for some nonexistent diamonds!

50:37.401 --> 50:40.604
And what the hell
is my black wig doing in the pool?!

50:56.419 --> 50:58.791
- She's...
- Dead.

50:58.921 --> 51:02.005
Supposed to be you.
The next link in the pipeline.

51:03.259 --> 51:05.547
What are you talking about?

51:05.677 --> 51:09.212
Poor Plenty must have
stumbled in here looking for you.

51:09.347 --> 51:11.387
I don't believe you.

51:11.516 --> 51:15.644
A dentist is dead in South Africa.
That little old lady in Amsterdam.

51:15.771 --> 51:18.641
Shady got his last night.
They've missed me once.

51:18.773 --> 51:20.647
And you're next.

51:20.775 --> 51:23.776
- Now, who's your connection?
- You sound like a cop...

51:25.112 --> 51:29.192
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.

51:29.324 --> 51:33.368
They got me this place and told me
to wait for further instructions.

51:33.496 --> 51:35.951
You'd find it difficult to hear under water.

51:36.081 --> 51:38.619
- Now, where's the stuff?
- Who are you?

51:38.750 --> 51:41.455
You're not a cop
and you're not Peter Franks.

51:41.586 --> 51:44.587
You're not the type to turn
the other cheek. Where is it?

51:44.839 --> 51:50.081
Eastern Airlines announce the arrival
of flight 112 from Los Angeles,

51:50.219 --> 51:52.128
gate 7.

52:22.332 --> 52:23.957
Thank you.

52:54.988 --> 52:57.111
Fill it up, please.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.782
It's Bert Saxby.

52:58.908 --> 53:01.743
Willard Whyte's right-hand man.

53:06.206 --> 53:09.123
Do you see the top? The penthouse?

53:09.251 --> 53:13.296
They say Willard Whyte hasn't
set foot out of there in three years.

53:13.422 --> 53:15.461
And no one has seen him - no one.

53:20.053 --> 53:22.674
- How much is that?
- Did you pay for this?

53:22.805 --> 53:24.299
Cut him off.

53:34.525 --> 53:36.648
Hey, Curly! What about my stamps?

53:36.777 --> 53:38.983
Where are you going?
Are you mad? Let me by!

53:39.112 --> 53:41.069
Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet!

53:41.198 --> 53:45.444
- OK, so shove a coupla gallons in!
- Well, back it up.

53:48.621 --> 53:52.785
Keep leaning on that tooter, Charlie,
and you'll get a shot in the mouth!

53:52.917 --> 53:54.495
Come on, lady, move it!

53:54.627 --> 53:57.034
OK, lady, you win, you win.

53:59.131 --> 54:02.215
- Will someone move that car?!
- Do what he says!

54:04.761 --> 54:07.382
Hey! I wanted high-test!

54:08.431 --> 54:11.717
Forget it, Curly!
You had your chance and you blew it!

55:18.163 --> 55:19.787
OK, Professor.

56:43.034 --> 56:44.659
- Hello.
- Hi.

56:44.786 --> 56:48.285
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

56:48.414 --> 56:51.498
- New here?
- I've been here three years. G Section.

56:51.626 --> 56:53.748
How are things in G Section?

56:53.878 --> 56:56.084
Still the same old grind. You know.

56:56.213 --> 56:59.213
Checking radiation shields
for replacement.

56:59.341 --> 57:01.463
By the way, where's yours?

57:01.593 --> 57:06.172
I've been waiting a couple of days
for you guys to deliver them.

57:06.306 --> 57:09.675
Gee, I'm sorry. You should have
given us a phone call.

57:09.809 --> 57:13.225
Look, I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.

57:13.354 --> 57:17.019
You keep that on. You can't be
too careful about radiation.

57:17.149 --> 57:19.770
Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.

57:19.901 --> 57:21.941
See you around.

57:47.052 --> 57:49.508
Who are you? What do you want?

57:49.638 --> 57:51.761
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.

57:51.890 --> 57:54.760
Just... checking on radiation shields.

57:54.893 --> 57:56.766
Now let me see. You are...?

57:56.894 --> 57:59.646
Professor Dr. Metz. Our shields are fine!

57:59.772 --> 58:01.349
Now get out!

58:01.482 --> 58:04.187
I'm sorry. It won't take a moment but

58:04.319 --> 58:06.358
I must verify.

58:06.487 --> 58:08.859
Metz. How do you spell it?

58:08.989 --> 58:12.405
M- E... Will you please leave,
you irritating man?

58:12.534 --> 58:15.819
Doctor, there's no reason
to run down the little people.

58:15.954 --> 58:19.702
G Section may not be as important
to the operation as you are,

58:19.832 --> 58:21.660
but we do have our orders.

58:21.793 --> 58:23.833
Dr. Metz... Willard Whyte for you.

58:23.962 --> 58:26.001
Right. Out, out.

58:30.009 --> 58:31.836
Hello, WW.

58:31.969 --> 58:34.008
Yes, it's finally here.

58:35.722 --> 58:37.845
Quite enough for completion.

58:39.976 --> 58:42.016
We'll be through shortly.

58:42.146 --> 58:44.138
No. No problems at all.

58:46.483 --> 58:48.107
Right.

58:51.904 --> 58:55.189
- Now will you get out of here?!
- Certainly, Doctor.

58:55.324 --> 58:57.530
I've seen everything I need to see.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.699
Thank you very much.

59:03.124 --> 59:06.290
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.

59:06.418 --> 59:08.457
G Section.

59:12.298 --> 59:14.338
Checking radiation shields?

59:29.523 --> 59:31.811
There he is! Behind the rock! Come on!

59:34.652 --> 59:36.728
What is this? Amateur night?

59:36.863 --> 59:38.902
Stop him, Harry!

59:43.912 --> 59:46.449
Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy.

59:46.581 --> 59:48.075
Get out of that moon buggy!

01:00:16.858 --> 01:00:18.484
It's gone berserk!

01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:22.943
Hey, what do you think you're doin'?!

01:02:04.626 --> 01:02:06.665
That way!

01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:07.760
- What happened? The diamonds...
- Get in the car!

01:03:07.888 --> 01:03:11.174
If you see a mad professor
in a minibus, just smile!

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.990
Fred, get the sheriff's office.

01:03:40.507 --> 01:03:44.423
Drop me off at the next corner.
This is getting out of hand.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:48.138
When you start stealing moon machines
from Willard Whyte,

01:03:48.267 --> 01:03:49.760
goodbye and good luck!

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:53.558
Just relax. I have a friend named Felix
who can fix anything.

01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:56.262
Is he married?

01:03:58.444 --> 01:04:01.648
There goes that
son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur!

01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:16.668
Relax! You've got a friend
named Felix who can fix anything.

01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:19.003
Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte.

01:04:25.557 --> 01:04:26.338
Why, you dirty...

01:06:47.798 --> 01:06:49.921
Come in, Larry. Larry?

01:06:51.009 --> 01:06:52.467
Larry?

01:06:52.593 --> 01:06:54.634
Did you get him, Larry?

01:06:56.264 --> 01:06:58.304
I think Larry got him.

01:06:58.433 --> 01:07:00.473
- Sheriff...
- Attaboy, Larry.

01:07:00.602 --> 01:07:02.228
Come in. Larry?

01:07:02.355 --> 01:07:03.730
Sheriff...

01:07:19.707 --> 01:07:20.953
I got you now.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.830
Lean over.

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:01.418
Darling...

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:05.672
Why are we suddenly staying
in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?

01:08:05.798 --> 01:08:09.050
In order to form
a more perfect union, sweetheart.

01:08:09.178 --> 01:08:10.803
James...

01:08:11.805 --> 01:08:14.476
May I finally call you James?

01:08:17.812 --> 01:08:19.852
What's going to happen to me?

01:08:22.609 --> 01:08:25.147
You did talk to
your friend Felix about me?

01:08:26.613 --> 01:08:28.406
What did he say?

01:08:28.533 --> 01:08:31.948
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.

01:08:32.077 --> 01:08:34.913
- 20 years to life?!
- Relax, darling.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.365
I'm on top of the situation.

01:08:47.554 --> 01:08:49.594
Mr. and Mrs. Jones?

01:08:49.723 --> 01:08:52.591
Yes, that's the name
on the register, Mr. Leiter.

01:08:52.725 --> 01:08:55.644
- What's the score with WW?
- Washington says no go.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.810
- We sit still for now.
- Sit still?

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:02.817
And Miss Tiffany Case "Jones" has
a lifetime reservation at another hotel.

01:09:02.946 --> 01:09:05.068
The kind the government... runs.

01:09:05.281 --> 01:09:07.571
I'm cooperating, Mr. Leiter.

01:09:07.702 --> 01:09:09.528
Really I am.

01:09:09.662 --> 01:09:11.700
I can vouch for that.

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:15.448
Felix, this is not the real White House,
and he's not the president.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:19.082
- Why don't we go and see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.

01:09:19.212 --> 01:09:22.915
But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.

01:09:23.051 --> 01:09:25.885
In the meantime, I'm sure
you and "Mrs. Jones"

01:09:26.011 --> 01:09:28.255
can find some way to amuse yourselves.

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:32.434
And just to make sure you're not
disturbed, I have a man upstairs.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.563
And Hamilton... is right out here.

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:37.729
So long, James.

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:40.314
- Well, that's a switch!
- What's that?

01:09:40.444 --> 01:09:43.529
The wolf being guarded
by the three little pigs.

01:09:45.408 --> 01:09:47.865
I won't be long, darling.

01:09:47.996 --> 01:09:50.154
Where are you going?

01:09:50.288 --> 01:09:52.957
I'm just popping upstairs for a moment.

01:10:01.135 --> 01:10:05.298
- Sixteenth floor?
- No, lady. Starlight Lounge only.

01:10:06.223 --> 01:10:09.724
OK, folks. Stand clear
of the doors. Here we go.

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:53.730
Starlight Lounge to the left.
Express to street level only, folks.

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.311
OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:31.522
Howdy, son. We've been expectin' you.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.944
You got any personal business
to take care of in there,

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:36.952
you go right ahead.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.653
First, I suspect you're wearin' a hog leg.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:42.497
Would you mind standin' up
and takin' it off?

01:13:45.965 --> 01:13:48.005
Isn't that nice?

01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:50.174
You are a pleasant fella.

01:13:51.387 --> 01:13:53.428
Why don't you just come on in, son?

01:13:53.558 --> 01:13:55.846
Relax. Make yourself comfortable.

01:13:55.977 --> 01:13:58.098
That's good. Right on over there.

01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:21.335
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

01:14:21.463 --> 01:14:22.838
Blofeld.

01:14:25.425 --> 01:14:27.253
Good evening, 007.

01:14:31.014 --> 01:14:32.592
Double jeopardy, Mr. Bond.

01:14:32.724 --> 01:14:36.260
You killed my only other double,
I'm afraid.

01:14:36.396 --> 01:14:41.023
After his death, volunteers were
- understandably - rather scarce.

01:14:41.151 --> 01:14:43.772
Such a pity. All that time and expense

01:14:43.903 --> 01:14:47.356
simply to provide you
with one mock-heroic moment.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.202
Willard Whyte speakin'.

01:14:57.543 --> 01:14:59.751
Yes, Governor. I got your message.

01:14:59.881 --> 01:15:03.463
No, I'm afraid a personal appearance
is quite out of the question.

01:15:03.592 --> 01:15:06.213
I'll send a deposition to the committee.

01:15:07.055 --> 01:15:09.094
Thank you, Governor.

01:15:10.641 --> 01:15:12.433
Well, that's a neat trick.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.600
A voice box, Mr. Bond.

01:15:14.729 --> 01:15:16.971
Science was never my strong suit,

01:15:17.107 --> 01:15:19.395
but the principle is easy enough.

01:15:19.653 --> 01:15:22.226
Someone's voice patterns and resonance

01:15:22.363 --> 01:15:25.233
stored in a small oral-signature tape.

01:15:25.366 --> 01:15:29.447
And a miniature, transistorized version
is installed in his neck.

01:15:29.579 --> 01:15:31.785
Or is it his neck? I never can remember.

01:15:31.915 --> 01:15:34.750
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.

01:15:37.254 --> 01:15:39.293
My congratulations to you both.

01:15:43.302 --> 01:15:45.342
Nice little company.

01:15:47.182 --> 01:15:50.551
Explosives, oil, electronics,
houses, aviation.

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:52.808
I've done rather well with it, too.

01:15:52.939 --> 01:15:57.185
Tried to cut some of the fat off,
but Mr. Whyte's a splendid administrator.

01:15:57.317 --> 01:15:59.144
Damn thing runs itself.

01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:01.106
I suppose you killed him.

01:16:01.239 --> 01:16:02.899
Nothing so melodramatic.

01:16:03.032 --> 01:16:06.116
I'm simply holding him
in cold storage, so to speak.

01:16:06.245 --> 01:16:10.372
An insurance policy against any
outside interference with my plans.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:14.118
The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.

01:16:14.253 --> 01:16:16.791
Who'd miss someone
who's already missing?

01:16:16.922 --> 01:16:18.998
How clever you are, Mr. Bond.

01:16:19.133 --> 01:16:23.712
Nice to see you haven't lost
that fine mental edge, 007.

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:26.386
Please don't get any foolish notions.

01:16:26.518 --> 01:16:28.973
That missile is not a practical weapon.

01:16:30.979 --> 01:16:33.732
Well, it's hardly worth the effort.

01:16:34.275 --> 01:16:37.395
After all, I wouldn't know
which one of you to kill.

01:16:37.528 --> 01:16:40.151
We appreciate
your predicament, Mr. Bond.

01:16:40.282 --> 01:16:42.240
We deeply sympathize.

01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:02.922
Right idea, Mr. Bond.

01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:05.382
But wrong pussy.

01:17:05.517 --> 01:17:09.386
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr. Bond.

01:17:10.898 --> 01:17:13.651
However potentially painful they may be.

01:17:13.777 --> 01:17:16.233
But I'm afraid this one
has come to an end.

01:17:16.363 --> 01:17:19.198
What do you intend to do
with those diamonds?

01:17:19.324 --> 01:17:21.364
An excellent question.

01:17:21.495 --> 01:17:25.029
And one which will be hanging
on the lips of the world quite soon.

01:17:25.164 --> 01:17:27.323
If I were to break the news to anyone,

01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:30.032
it would be to you first. You know that.

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:32.625
But it's late, I'm tired,

01:17:32.757 --> 01:17:34.797
and there's so much left to do.

01:17:37.927 --> 01:17:39.969
Good night, Mr. Bond.

01:17:47.564 --> 01:17:50.351
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.

01:17:50.483 --> 01:17:52.774
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".

01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:58.815
In any event, I'm sure
you'll find it much more convenient

01:17:58.951 --> 01:18:02.238
than mountaineering about
outside the Whyte House.

01:18:02.372 --> 01:18:04.411
You press L, Mr. Bond.

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.831
The word "lobby" begins with L.

01:18:38.411 --> 01:18:42.078
If at first you don't succeed, Mr. Kidd...

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:44.246
Try, try again, Mr. Wint.

01:21:52.543 --> 01:21:54.998
One of us smells like
a tart's handkerchief.

01:22:02.761 --> 01:22:05.432
I'm afraid it's me.
Sorry about that, old boy.

01:22:45.768 --> 01:22:49.634
I don't mind the cockamamie machine
breaking down twice a day.

01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:54.730
But why the hell does it always have to be
500 yards away from the nearest hatch?

01:22:57.154 --> 01:23:00.405
All right, Charlie.
It's your turn to play hunchback.

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:06.411
Thank you very much.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.204
I was just out walking my rat
and I seem to have lost my way.

01:23:14.758 --> 01:23:16.251
Willard Whyte speakin'.

01:23:16.383 --> 01:23:18.423
This is Bert.

01:23:20.222 --> 01:23:22.049
We got a problem.

01:23:24.392 --> 01:23:26.635
What's wrong with your voice?
Got a cold?

01:23:29.982 --> 01:23:32.023
Never mind about that.

01:23:32.152 --> 01:23:34.192
I just saw James Bond in the casino.

01:23:34.321 --> 01:23:37.275
- That's impossible.
- Come and see for yourself.

01:23:37.407 --> 01:23:39.033
Hey, listen.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.943
If he's half the genius they say he is,
we're in for real trouble.

01:23:43.079 --> 01:23:46.331
- Calm down, Bert.
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.

01:23:46.459 --> 01:23:49.080
This place must be
crawling with agents by now.

01:23:49.211 --> 01:23:52.000
- I think we should move Willard Whyte.
- Nonsense.

01:23:52.133 --> 01:23:55.003
Mr. Whyte is perfectly safe
at his own summerhouse.

01:23:55.135 --> 01:23:57.626
It's on the ridge,
about ten miles out of town.

01:23:57.762 --> 01:24:01.049
I'm a little surprised, Bert.
It's not like you to panic.

01:24:01.184 --> 01:24:04.967
I just don't enjoy messing around
with a guy as tough as James Bond.

01:24:05.105 --> 01:24:08.556
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.

01:24:08.691 --> 01:24:12.358
I'm afraid Mr. Whyte has suddenly
outgrown his usefulness.

01:24:12.488 --> 01:24:14.646
- Do it cleanly, Bert.
- Don't worry.

01:24:14.782 --> 01:24:16.820
Just leave everything to me.

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:22.285
That ridiculous contraption
actually seems to work, Q.

01:24:22.415 --> 01:24:24.787
You've surpassed yourself this time.

01:24:24.917 --> 01:24:28.619
Not a bit of it. Made one of these
for the kids last Christmas.

01:24:28.755 --> 01:24:31.211
Maxwell, James and I
will head for the house.

01:24:31.341 --> 01:24:34.177
Get set to hit the penthouse
as soon as we find Whyte.

01:24:34.304 --> 01:24:36.342
Let me speak to Metz.

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:40.173
There's been a change.
Push all plans forward by 24 hours.

01:24:40.311 --> 01:24:42.598
I'm joining you immediately.

01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:53.448
Give me five minutes to get up there
and five minutes to find Whyte.

01:24:53.574 --> 01:24:55.650
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:24:57.536 --> 01:24:59.660
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.

01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:05.545
Tell Maxwell to stand by
to hit the penthouse.

01:25:57.561 --> 01:25:58.973
Well, hi there!

01:26:05.154 --> 01:26:06.564
I'm Bambi.

01:26:08.323 --> 01:26:10.150
Good morning... Bambi.

01:26:10.283 --> 01:26:12.111
And I'm Thumper.

01:26:13.204 --> 01:26:15.659
Is there something we can do for you?

01:26:15.789 --> 01:26:18.661
I can think of several things offhand but

01:26:18.794 --> 01:26:21.664
at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.

01:26:21.796 --> 01:26:23.290
Oh, Willie.

01:26:23.423 --> 01:26:25.463
Why, he's right out there.

01:26:28.178 --> 01:26:31.298
And that's all there is to it?

01:26:31.433 --> 01:26:33.472
Not quite.

01:26:34.894 --> 01:26:38.015
First... we're gonna have a ball.

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:45.196
All yours, Bambi!

01:27:02.049 --> 01:27:03.922
You're on again, Bambi!

01:27:09.014 --> 01:27:11.256
Thumper...

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:38.613
Hello, Felix.

01:28:38.739 --> 01:28:41.230
Willard Whyte is about to be executed,

01:28:41.366 --> 01:28:44.320
and guess who's giving
breaststroke lessons.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.365
- Where the hell is Whyte?
- I haven't found out yet.

01:28:53.714 --> 01:28:55.338
Still haven't found out.

01:29:03.515 --> 01:29:05.343
Right!

01:29:30.545 --> 01:29:32.124
FBI?

01:29:32.256 --> 01:29:34.296
- CIA?
- No.

01:29:34.425 --> 01:29:36.880
British Intelligence, Mr. Whyte.
James Bond.

01:29:39.472 --> 01:29:42.472
I see you've met my friends,
Bambi and Thumper.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.641
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.

01:29:45.687 --> 01:29:49.138
What the hell's happened to me
and what can I do about it?

01:29:49.274 --> 01:29:53.273
Let's get out of here first
and I'll explain it to you en route.

01:29:54.197 --> 01:29:56.866
Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...

01:30:10.924 --> 01:30:12.548
Saxby.

01:30:13.677 --> 01:30:16.926
- Bert Saxby?!
- Yeah.

01:30:17.054 --> 01:30:19.095
Tell him he's fired.

01:30:34.657 --> 01:30:37.113
Hi there, Mr. Q. Are you having any luck?

01:30:37.243 --> 01:30:39.914
I'm being somewhat successful,
thank you.

01:30:40.039 --> 01:30:42.244
Listen, Mr. Q. I... I was wondering.

01:30:42.374 --> 01:30:44.582
Have you heard any talk about me

01:30:44.711 --> 01:30:46.751
from Felix or James?

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.918
No, I'm afraid not.

01:30:49.048 --> 01:30:51.836
I guess I'm working
for the good guys now,

01:30:51.969 --> 01:30:55.882
but I'm two steps away from
the slammer if they want me there.

01:30:56.014 --> 01:31:00.345
I thought... you might be able
to put in a good word.

01:31:07.694 --> 01:31:09.733
That's unbelievable!

01:31:11.407 --> 01:31:15.071
An electromagnetic RPM controller.

01:31:15.202 --> 01:31:17.990
Been aching to give it a try. You see,

01:31:18.123 --> 01:31:21.456
pressure on the case when
the desired symbols appear

01:31:21.584 --> 01:31:27.623
causes the rotation of the cylinders to
stutter at the precise moment needed to...

01:31:37.353 --> 01:31:38.976
Cab, lady?

01:31:46.612 --> 01:31:50.443
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:31:50.574 --> 01:31:52.782
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.

01:31:52.911 --> 01:31:56.825
I'd so dreaded the prospect of
making this tedious journey alone.

01:32:01.003 --> 01:32:03.042
This way, Mr. Whyte.

01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:12.011
It was right here.

01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:14.631
About six feet high, with a solar panel.

01:32:14.767 --> 01:32:18.552
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.

01:32:18.689 --> 01:32:21.061
Was Dr. Metz on your payroll, Mr. Whyte?

01:32:21.191 --> 01:32:24.562
No. But I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.

01:32:24.696 --> 01:32:27.815
The world's leading expert
on laser refraction.

01:32:27.949 --> 01:32:30.404
A committed idealist to peace.

01:32:30.536 --> 01:32:34.663
And how in the hell Blofeld got
his hooks in him, I will never know!

01:32:34.789 --> 01:32:38.409
How did he get security clearance
to work here in the first place?

01:32:38.544 --> 01:32:41.628
From you, sir. I talked
to you personally about it.

01:32:41.755 --> 01:32:44.129
I even recognized your voice just now.

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:46.299
I'm sure I must've told you

01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:50.557
not to keep the usual duplicate
microfilm records of the project.

01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:52.510
Exactly, sir.

01:32:52.644 --> 01:32:56.178
Tom, what did I tell you to do with this?

01:32:56.313 --> 01:32:58.354
Send it to Vandenberg, sir.

01:32:58.483 --> 01:33:00.938
Well, get 'em on the phone - now!

01:33:07.993 --> 01:33:09.404
Yeah?

01:33:09.536 --> 01:33:11.281
You won't believe this.

01:33:11.414 --> 01:33:13.453
- Willard Whyte for you!
- Wow.

01:33:13.583 --> 01:33:16.453
- This is a real honor, sir.
- Shove your honor!

01:33:16.585 --> 01:33:20.714
- Where's that satellite I sent down there?
- Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.

01:33:24.929 --> 01:33:29.555
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.

01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:38.557
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment.

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:41.612
The scanners have gone crazy.

01:33:41.738 --> 01:33:45.238
- Premature first-stage separation!
- It doesn't make sense!

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:58.502
Stand by to abort!

01:34:02.511 --> 01:34:04.421
We can't control it, sir.

01:34:04.556 --> 01:34:05.671
Abort it!

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.301
It's negative.

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:10.519
We can't. Something's taken over
the guidance system!

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.020
It's as if it had a will of its own.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:16.687
And there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

01:34:16.818 --> 01:34:19.489
We're working on it.
I'll call you back, Mr. Whyte.

01:34:22.616 --> 01:34:26.911
Whatever it is,
your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:37.964
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated
by an expert in light refraction.

01:34:38.092 --> 01:34:41.377
The first laser beam
was generated through a diamond.

01:34:41.512 --> 01:34:44.087
And if old Metz deserves his reputation,

01:34:44.225 --> 01:34:46.894
the power of that thing
could be incredible.

01:34:47.019 --> 01:34:48.810
And Blofeld's got it.

01:34:51.941 --> 01:34:55.226
- Where is it now?
- Approaching North Dakota.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.402
Alert Strategic Air Command.

01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:59.239
Gimme an open line to SAC.

01:35:01.117 --> 01:35:05.448
Attention all personnel.
Attention all personnel.

01:35:05.581 --> 01:35:09.530
We have a red alert. Stand by
for emergency procedure.

01:35:28.271 --> 01:35:30.313
Willard Whyte.

01:35:34.404 --> 01:35:36.443
Yes, General.

01:35:39.493 --> 01:35:44.322
One of our missiles just "accidentally"
blew up in North Dakota.

01:35:45.667 --> 01:35:48.501
Whatever's happenin',
Mr. Bond, has started.

01:36:09.025 --> 01:36:12.940
- Is this your herd?
- Mr. Whyte, phone call from Washington.

01:36:13.072 --> 01:36:15.110
- Urgent.
- I'll catch it in the john.

01:36:15.241 --> 01:36:17.281
- What about Blofeld?
- Not a trace.

01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:19.450
We found a tunnel. We'll check it out.

01:36:19.579 --> 01:36:22.663
- Where's Tiffany?
- Do you mind if we find Blofeld first?

01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:24.830
Come on! Let's hit that tunnel!

01:36:52.532 --> 01:36:56.445
Washington just got word
from your friend with the cat.

01:36:56.579 --> 01:37:01.239
Would you believe that this whole
damn country is bein' held for ransom

01:37:01.374 --> 01:37:04.080
and we've got
till noon tomorrow to pay up?

01:37:04.212 --> 01:37:07.295
So that's it. Well, I'm sure
you won't be alone.

01:37:07.423 --> 01:37:09.462
An international auction,

01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:13.127
with nuclear supremacy
goin' to the highest bidder.

01:37:15.682 --> 01:37:18.969
Tell me, what does he need
to control that satellite?

01:37:19.103 --> 01:37:21.854
A simple set of tapes
fed into a computer bank.

01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:24.104
All he really needs is a building.

01:37:24.234 --> 01:37:26.855
And these tapes? Large or small?

01:37:28.237 --> 01:37:30.278
Conceivably any size.

01:37:30.407 --> 01:37:32.447
From six inches to a cassette.

01:37:34.077 --> 01:37:37.281
Assuming he's still using
your empire as a cover,

01:37:37.415 --> 01:37:39.822
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.

01:37:39.959 --> 01:37:41.998
From Alaska to Florida.

01:37:42.127 --> 01:37:44.168
From Maine to Oregon.

01:37:44.297 --> 01:37:46.966
From Texas to... Baja California.

01:37:48.927 --> 01:37:50.552
Baja?!

01:37:51.973 --> 01:37:54.011
I haven't got anything in Baja!

01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:04.607
There is still no official explanation

01:38:04.736 --> 01:38:08.151
of the apparent nuclear accidents
in North Dakota and Russia.

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:12.115
Presidential news secretary John Fenner
refused comment on a report

01:38:12.245 --> 01:38:15.779
that an emergency meeting of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session.

01:38:15.914 --> 01:38:20.458
It is believed the United States and
the Soviet Union have assured each other

01:38:20.586 --> 01:38:23.921
that no offensive action
has been taken by either nation.

01:38:24.049 --> 01:38:28.213
Reports of another nuclear accident
in Red China are as yet unconfirmed.

01:38:28.887 --> 01:38:32.672
Two more submarines have taken up
position not ten miles away.

01:38:32.809 --> 01:38:35.762
Are those military aircraft
going to stand off forever?

01:38:35.895 --> 01:38:39.395
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they attack?

01:38:39.524 --> 01:38:43.653
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical
show of force was only to be expected.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.815
The Great Powers
flexing their military muscles

01:38:46.949 --> 01:38:48.988
like so many impotent beach boys.

01:38:49.118 --> 01:38:53.448
I deeply regret my threat to destroy
a major city unless they give in,

01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:58.292
but the nuclear powers, like all bullies,
can only be intimidated by force.

01:38:58.421 --> 01:39:02.121
- But how can you...
- They still have an hour left to reply.

01:39:02.257 --> 01:39:07.050
One hour for both of us to achieve
our common dream: Total disarmament

01:39:07.179 --> 01:39:09.219
and peace for the world.

01:39:11.143 --> 01:39:14.345
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?

01:39:14.479 --> 01:39:16.520
Two miles, and closing.

01:39:18.318 --> 01:39:20.274
Stage One alert, please.

01:39:20.402 --> 01:39:22.395
Command Center.

01:39:22.529 --> 01:39:24.439
All crew to Stage One.

01:39:27.368 --> 01:39:29.407
Up the top! Second platform!

01:39:32.708 --> 01:39:33.703
There he is!

01:39:57.277 --> 01:39:59.768
- Aim!
- Hold your fire!

01:40:14.837 --> 01:40:19.998
All recovery crew personnel,
proceed to docking level and stand by.

01:40:30.814 --> 01:40:33.897
Good morning, gentlemen!
The Acme Pollution Inspection.

01:40:34.024 --> 01:40:38.154
We're cleaning up the world. We thought
this was a suitable starting point.

01:41:09.146 --> 01:41:12.896
How disappointing! I expected
one head of state, at the very least.

01:41:13.026 --> 01:41:15.731
Surely you haven't come
to negotiate, Mr. Bond?

01:41:15.862 --> 01:41:19.363
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.

01:41:19.492 --> 01:41:23.870
Search him from his toenails to the last
follicle on his head. Then bring him to me.

01:41:49.651 --> 01:41:51.690
I do so hate martial music.

01:41:54.447 --> 01:41:57.152
As usual, Mr. Bond,
you were absolutely right.

01:41:57.284 --> 01:42:02.159
You guessed correctly that that box
contained the satellite control tape

01:42:02.288 --> 01:42:06.157
and you came aboard presumably
hoping to substitute this

01:42:06.293 --> 01:42:08.333
for the real thing.

01:42:10.465 --> 01:42:14.379
So sorry to have ruined
the line of your suit for nothing.

01:42:16.013 --> 01:42:19.595
Talking about lines,
which one did you use on Miss Case?

01:42:19.724 --> 01:42:21.764
She has taken a reasonable attitude.

01:42:21.893 --> 01:42:26.022
Like any sensible animal,
she's only threatening when threatened.

01:42:27.775 --> 01:42:30.777
Well, it appears that
you're holding all the aces.

01:42:30.905 --> 01:42:34.652
- Right down to the dragon lady here.
- Jealousy? From you, Mr. Bond?

01:42:34.783 --> 01:42:36.823
I'm flattered.

01:42:36.952 --> 01:42:39.573
As La Rochefoucauld observed:

01:42:39.705 --> 01:42:42.494
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."

01:42:42.626 --> 01:42:44.665
I do hold the winning hand.

01:42:45.753 --> 01:42:50.048
Why don't you let me take you
on a little tour of our facilities?

01:42:50.175 --> 01:42:53.092
Your chance to see
the real tape once again.

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:55.378
Can I tag along, Ernst?

01:42:57.934 --> 01:43:01.302
I'd put something on
over that bikini first, my dear.

01:43:01.437 --> 01:43:04.226
I've come too far
to have the aim of my crew

01:43:04.358 --> 01:43:06.848
affected by the sight of a pretty body.

01:43:06.984 --> 01:43:09.026
No word yet from anyone!

01:43:10.114 --> 01:43:12.153
Only 12 minutes left.

01:43:12.283 --> 01:43:16.495
I suppose a little gentle prodding
is called for.

01:43:17.581 --> 01:43:21.957
As you see, Mr. Bond,
the satellite is at present over

01:43:22.084 --> 01:43:24.328
Kansas.

01:43:25.547 --> 01:43:29.712
If we destroy Kansas, the world
may not hear about it for years.

01:43:29.844 --> 01:43:32.679
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.

01:43:32.805 --> 01:43:35.642
It would give them a chance
for a fresh start.

01:43:35.768 --> 01:43:38.093
Washington, DC. Perfect.

01:43:38.228 --> 01:43:41.846
Since we have not heard from them,
they will hear from us.

01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:44.818
- See to it, Metz.
- Washington. Right.

01:43:46.111 --> 01:43:50.240
And this, presumably,
is the control bank with the coded tape.

01:43:50.366 --> 01:43:52.240
Right again, Mr. Bond.

01:43:52.368 --> 01:43:55.369
All satellites are controlled
by a coded tape.

01:43:55.498 --> 01:43:57.953
The trick is, of course, to have the code.

01:43:58.083 --> 01:43:59.494
Obviously.

01:43:59.626 --> 01:44:04.171
It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose
one just presses that and out it pops.

01:44:08.929 --> 01:44:10.588
Put it back, Mr. Bond.

01:44:10.723 --> 01:44:12.761
Immediately.

01:44:18.856 --> 01:44:20.397
Hi, Ernst.

01:44:20.523 --> 01:44:22.684
Is Superman giving you any trouble?

01:44:22.819 --> 01:44:24.859
Put it back... very carefully.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.610
You've suddenly
become tiresome, Mr. Bond.

01:44:33.746 --> 01:44:36.037
Target fixed! Commence countdown!

01:44:36.167 --> 01:44:38.124
Ten minutes and counting!

01:44:39.086 --> 01:44:41.542
Take him away and throw him in the brig.

01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:45.082
And search him again, just to make sure.

01:44:53.101 --> 01:44:54.098
Bitch!

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:58.934
Come on!

01:44:59.067 --> 01:45:01.439
Your problems are all behind you now.

01:45:32.061 --> 01:45:33.685
Stop him!

01:45:37.151 --> 01:45:39.985
Nine minutes and counting.

01:45:45.451 --> 01:45:48.120
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.

01:45:48.245 --> 01:45:51.034
You stupid twit. You put
the real one back in.

01:45:51.166 --> 01:45:53.205
Come on, let's go!

01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:15.314
A weather balloon!

01:46:16.945 --> 01:46:20.444
- What do you think, Mr. Leiter?
- That must be the signal.

01:46:20.573 --> 01:46:24.702
There isn't a low-pressure area
within 200 miles of here. Let's go!

01:46:26.704 --> 01:46:28.948
This is Charlie One to Squadron.

01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:33.080
Charlie One to Squadron.
Ready all guns and proceed to target.

01:46:33.211 --> 01:46:35.253
I repeat: Proceed to target.

01:46:35.382 --> 01:46:37.505
Roger, Charlie One. Out.

01:46:38.259 --> 01:46:41.425
Come on, Bond. Get the hell off that rig.

01:46:41.554 --> 01:46:43.963
Eight minutes and counting.

01:46:47.977 --> 01:46:52.308
Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly.
Range... five miles.

01:46:52.441 --> 01:46:54.481
But I... I don't understand!

01:46:54.610 --> 01:46:58.229
- You said they wouldn't attack!
- The balloon was a signal.

01:46:58.365 --> 01:47:02.233
The stupid fools must think
Mr. Bond has accomplished his mission.

01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:04.907
- Activate defenses!
- Activate defenses.

01:47:17.178 --> 01:47:19.928
Seven minutes and counting.

01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:32.727
This is Charlie One.

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:34.734
Commence attack!

01:47:34.862 --> 01:47:36.904
Commence attack!

01:48:09.735 --> 01:48:11.893
Six minutes and counting.

01:48:12.029 --> 01:48:14.068
Get them on the radio, Blofeld!

01:48:14.197 --> 01:48:15.741
- Tell them we give up!
- Give up?

01:48:15.867 --> 01:48:18.073
I've waited too long for this moment.

01:48:18.202 --> 01:48:21.487
They'll pay dearly
for making a fool out of me.

01:48:21.624 --> 01:48:25.039
I see it all now.
You don't give a damn about peace!

01:48:25.168 --> 01:48:27.624
- All you care about...
- Shut up, Metz.

01:48:29.632 --> 01:48:31.174
Tiffany, my dear.

01:48:32.884 --> 01:48:36.255
We're showing a bit more cheek
than usual, aren't we?

01:48:42.855 --> 01:48:45.524
Take her below and
lock her up with Mr. Bond.

01:48:45.649 --> 01:48:48.936
What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.

01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:51.312
If only they were brains.

01:48:51.447 --> 01:48:53.606
Destroy this, Metz.

01:49:08.967 --> 01:49:11.636
Five minutes and counting.

01:50:05.653 --> 01:50:07.693
Four minutes and counting.

01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:31.681
Tell them we surrender!
This is utter madness!

01:50:31.807 --> 01:50:35.509
One more word, Metz, and I'll
have you shot! Get back to your post!

01:50:40.317 --> 01:50:42.559
Prepare my bathosub immediately.

01:50:51.621 --> 01:50:54.112
Three minutes and counting.

01:51:11.059 --> 01:51:12.886
All systems interlock.

01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:15.558
Bathosub to crane. Commence lift.

01:51:31.832 --> 01:51:33.824
Two minutes and counting.

01:51:45.638 --> 01:51:48.676
Power and breathing systems on.

01:51:48.809 --> 01:51:51.134
Release catch is open.

01:51:52.646 --> 01:51:53.761
Lower away.

01:51:56.318 --> 01:51:59.068
Bathosub to crane! Lower away!

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:02.607
Wake up, man! Lower away!

01:52:09.749 --> 01:52:12.286
You stupid idiot! You could've killed me!

01:52:12.417 --> 01:52:14.126
Disengage!

01:52:14.588 --> 01:52:16.213
Disengage!

01:52:21.971 --> 01:52:23.549
Disengage!

01:52:23.681 --> 01:52:26.432
Lower! Not up!

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:32.769
One minute and counting.

01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:37.310
Blofeld to Command Center!

01:52:37.446 --> 01:52:39.485
Come in!

01:52:39.615 --> 01:52:41.739
Blofeld to Command Center!

01:52:41.868 --> 01:52:43.659
Come in!

01:52:51.961 --> 01:52:53.076
Damn you!

01:52:53.213 --> 01:52:55.253
Command Center, come in!

01:52:58.885 --> 01:53:02.172
40 seconds and counting.

01:53:08.105 --> 01:53:09.101
Get the gun.

01:53:13.318 --> 01:53:15.608
- Here!
- Shoot 'em!

01:53:31.130 --> 01:53:32.624
Jump!

01:53:34.343 --> 01:53:36.584
Ten... nine...

01:54:22.562 --> 01:54:26.180
So long, James! I'll wire M
you're on your way home!

01:54:26.315 --> 01:54:29.022
Don't tell him
which direction we've taken!

01:54:29.153 --> 01:54:30.979
If you're havin' a good time,

01:54:31.112 --> 01:54:35.241
let the captain know and
I'll have him steam around in circles!

01:54:48.007 --> 01:54:52.964
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you

01:54:53.095 --> 01:54:55.088
about us.

01:54:56.849 --> 01:55:01.311
I know in a relationship like ours, the
girl's not supposed to be the one to ask.

01:55:01.438 --> 01:55:03.478
But I can't help it.

01:55:03.607 --> 01:55:05.646
And please

01:55:05.776 --> 01:55:07.816
think before answering.

01:55:07.945 --> 01:55:09.985
That I promise.

01:55:10.448 --> 01:55:12.190
James...

01:55:25.255 --> 01:55:28.589
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.

01:55:28.718 --> 01:55:30.757
No mistake, sir.

01:55:30.886 --> 01:55:35.633
On the specific instructions and with
the compliments of Mr. Willard Whyte.

01:55:35.768 --> 01:55:37.759
Oysters Andaluz.

01:55:38.811 --> 01:55:40.806
Shashlik.

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:42.435
Tidbits.

01:55:42.567 --> 01:55:44.605
Prime rib en jus.

01:55:45.694 --> 01:55:47.735
Salade Utopia.

01:55:50.033 --> 01:55:52.275
And for dessert,

01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:55.496
the pièce de résistance...

01:55:56.999 --> 01:56:00.451
la bombe surprise.

01:56:02.756 --> 01:56:05.709
That looks fantastic! What's in it?

01:56:05.841 --> 01:56:09.294
But then there would be
no surprise, would there, madame?

01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:12.347
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.

01:56:12.474 --> 01:56:16.555
This will just take a moment,
and then we will leave you in peace.

01:56:17.646 --> 01:56:19.438
Wine, sir?

01:56:19.565 --> 01:56:21.605
Mouton Rothschild '55.

01:56:22.361 --> 01:56:25.194
- May we begin?
- Please do.

01:56:38.377 --> 01:56:40.502
A happy selection, if I may say.

01:56:40.631 --> 01:56:42.670
I'll be the judge of that.

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.250
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.

01:56:46.386 --> 01:56:49.009
Strong enough to bury anything.

01:56:52.935 --> 01:56:54.975
But the wine is quite excellent.

01:56:55.104 --> 01:56:59.102
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.

01:56:59.233 --> 01:57:01.357
Of course.

01:57:01.487 --> 01:57:05.567
Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked with clarets.

01:57:06.908 --> 01:57:09.863
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.

01:57:11.538 --> 01:57:15.953
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.

01:58:17.403 --> 01:58:20.820
He certainly left
with his tails between his legs.
