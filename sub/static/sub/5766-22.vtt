WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:07.763
Okay. This will
mostly be about... sex.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.439
And I need to know

00:10.470 --> 00:12.438
if that'll make anybody
uncomfortable.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.607
And it's okay if it does.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.244
Believe me, this stuff makes me

00:16.280 --> 00:18.305
feel wiggly.

00:18.350 --> 00:21.513
That's what my mom used
to call it: wiggly-toes.

00:21.550 --> 00:24.212
This is a simple
matter of contract law.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.788
I'm sorry to refute the sexual
tease of my opposing counsel,

00:27.820 --> 00:32.450
but really what I need to know
is: can you judge my client,

00:32.500 --> 00:34.491
an independent business owner,
fairly?

00:34.830 --> 00:37.060
Sex outside of marriage...

00:37.100 --> 00:39.330
sex with more than one person...

00:39.370 --> 00:41.338
sexualbondage".

00:41.370 --> 00:43.531
I'm sorry.
Ijust... I keep imagining

00:43.570 --> 00:46.300
my parents listening to this.
MAN:
Sure, I could be fair.

00:46.340 --> 00:49.377
We business people all struggle
with the same things

00:49.410 --> 00:51.549
more or less._ It doesn't
matter If It's sex

00:51.580 --> 00:54.674
or office supplies.
Accepted.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.281
If her_business_were dedicated
to Illegal or IIIICIt actIVIty,

00:58.320 --> 00:59.787
would that change your mind?

00:59.820 --> 01:02.084
Like what,
prostitution?
No.

01:02.130 --> 01:05.486
Her Web site,
SideEncounters.com,

01:05.530 --> 01:08.294
is dedicated to connecting
spouses who want to cheat.

01:08.330 --> 01:11.299
Well, I know my wife
won't approve,

01:11.330 --> 01:14.231
but... everybody
has to make a living.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.363
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

01:16.410 --> 01:18.867
I'd like to challenge
this juror for cause.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.606
There's no reason for cause,
Your Honor...
He's already
stated his opinion...

01:21.640 --> 01:25.144
No, no, no, I am not going to
let this trial get out of hand.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.775
I'll allow Mrs. Crozier's
challenge for cause.
It's "Miss" Crozier.

01:28.820 --> 01:31.311
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:31.350 --> 01:32.214
Miss?
It's all right.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.888
I am looking, if
that's any consolation.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.251
Uh, anyway...

01:36.290 --> 01:38.224
I would agree
with Mr. Gardner,

01:38.260 --> 01:39.796
you're both arguing your
case through voir dire,

01:39.830 --> 01:42.264
which I strenuously
disapprove of.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.224
And Your Honor, I'd like
to use, um, sexual images

01:45.270 --> 01:48.239
from the Web site in trial.
Come on, Your Honor.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.329
She's turning this
into a lawsuit about sex.

01:50.370 --> 01:54.374
Oop, maybe it's just me, but
this is a lawsuit about sex.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.809
No, the husband

01:55.840 --> 01:57.842
of your client used
my client's Web site

01:57.880 --> 02:00.576
to arrange a date,
and wound up dead. That's all.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.838
Could've been_a Web site
about antiqumg.
NANCY:
But it wasn't.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.414
It was about infidelity.
Your Honor,

02:04.450 --> 02:06.384
then we would likewise
like to introduce

02:06.420 --> 02:07.887
the police murder investigation

02:07.920 --> 02:09.888
into_ evidence.
That Investigation
was inconclusive.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.353
And how do we have
access to this?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.594
CARY:
30-year-old Sean Briglio.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.565
Found in Room 606
of the St. Martin Hotel.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.192
Handcuffed.
Ball gag in his mouth.

02:18.230 --> 02:20.494
And his penis
severed from his body.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.930
Yes, it's making me wince
even just talking about it.

02:23.970 --> 02:27.371
The... severed member
was found in the ice bucket.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.536
You're kidding.
No.

02:28.580 --> 02:29.945
On ice with the champagne.

02:29.980 --> 02:32.414
There's probably a joke
to be made about shrinkage,

02:32.450 --> 02:33.747
but I won't go there.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.668
I think you just did.
The date

02:35.720 --> 02:37.847
he arranged on your client's
lovely Web site,

02:37.890 --> 02:39.380
was with a "Cynthia R."

02:39.420 --> 02:41.388
Okay.
That's a
made-up name.

02:41.420 --> 02:45.288
And her handle was
"PrettiSpecial9."

02:45.330 --> 02:48.891
Traced that Ii? address
to a Copycrater In WInnetka.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.329
Trail ran cold there.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.190
Checked his other
earlier dates.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.298
All had alibis.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.296
It's still_ _
an open InvestIgatIon.

02:55.340 --> 02:56.705
Like Jimmy Hoffa, huh?

02:56.740 --> 02:58.560
I would imagine if Jimmy
Hoffa's penis was found

02:58.610 --> 02:59.929
in a hotel ice bucket,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.800
Chicago's finest
would be looking just as hard

03:01.840 --> 03:04.206
for his killer.
But we are tryIng to

03:04.250 --> 03:07.549
connect this homicide to
another female suspect In Texas.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.389
Also a castrator.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.547
Thanks, Cary.
Always a pleasure.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.854
Hey...

03:15.390 --> 03:17.324
I'm staying put.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.884
You're staying put?

03:18.930 --> 03:20.249
Where?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.426
Here.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.325
Oh, Peter Florrick
wants you?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.826
Yeah, isn't that odd?
I would've thought

03:24.870 --> 03:26.428
my competition with
his wife would've made me

03:26.470 --> 03:29.337
persona non grata.
Yeah, I would've
thought so, too.

03:29.370 --> 03:30.302
He doesn't seem
to care

03:30.340 --> 03:33.673
that Alicia and I aren't
on the best of terms.

03:33.710 --> 03:36.508
Read into that what you will.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.840
(door closes)

03:40.880 --> 03:44.486
Okay.
(clears throat)

03:47.320 --> 03:49.982
This is a monastery, Alicia.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.349
I am a priest.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.426
Whatever you tell me
does not leave here.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.928
It's not altruism;
it's pragmatism.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.622
I only have a practice
if I'm discreet.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.888
I am separating from my husband.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.640
These notes are for me.
I keep them under lock and key.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.739
So, you're looking for

04:17.790 --> 04:19.018
a divorce lawyer?

04:19.050 --> 04:21.610
No. Uh, we-we're separating.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.820
But you will divorce?

04:22.860 --> 04:25.829
I don't know... yet.

04:25.860 --> 04:26.997
I haven't decided yet.

04:27.030 --> 04:30.295
You're worried about
It gomg pubIIc?
Yes.

04:30.330 --> 04:33.458
I want to know
how to protect myself.
Financially?

04:33.500 --> 04:36.298
Yes. Is there anything
I should be doing?

04:36.340 --> 04:38.467
What is your husband's income
over the past two years?

04:38.510 --> 04:40.637
Negligible.
I've been the supporter.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.875
And he's one month away
from becoming State's Attorney.

04:42.910 --> 04:44.673
That's $220,000 a year.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.041
You'd actually be better off

04:46.080 --> 04:47.547
waiting till next year
to divorce.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.551
David, let's forget this.
(telephone rings)

04:52.590 --> 04:55.514
Yeah, what?

04:55.560 --> 04:57.528
Okay.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.323
Uh, you're needed upstairs.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.091
Alicia, I don't know
your personal situation.

05:03.130 --> 05:04.722
Frankly, I don't want to know.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.330
My tolerance for
mess is minimal.

05:07.370 --> 05:10.498
But I can tell you this:
you are like me.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.802
You like plans.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.977
You like lists.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.638
So make a list
of your Income,

05:15.680 --> 05:17.443
your expenses and his,

05:17.480 --> 05:18.708
and all relevant
tax returns.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.446
Bring it to me,
and I'll make you a list

05:21.480 --> 05:22.913
of everything you need to do

05:22.950 --> 05:25.441
to protect yourself. Okay?
Within the firm, we can call it

05:25.490 --> 05:27.355
"The Cole Divorce."

05:27.390 --> 05:29.358
Something I asked you
to work on with me.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.449
Okay.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.926
Thanks.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.599
Oh, no. No thanks.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.439
Uh, you're paying me now.

05:39.470 --> 05:40.835
That was one billable hour.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.907
I round up.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.862
KALINDA: Well, the bottom line
is, it's a cold case--

05:45.910 --> 05:47.639
a year-old unsolved homicide.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.501
Now the police suspect that
the victim was picked up

05:50.550 --> 05:52.472
from the
SideEncounters.com Web site,

05:52.520 --> 05:54.818
but there's no proof.

05:54.850 --> 05:57.648
So _our best defense
Is to play Into

05:57.690 --> 06:00.454
that ambiguity. How can our
client's Web site be responsible

06:00.490 --> 06:03.550
if the police haven't absolutely
concluded it's from her site?

06:03.590 --> 06:05.649
DIANE:
Oh, Alicia, good.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.158
We're going to trial
on SideEncounters,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.168
and we need you to take on
a more prominent role.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.758
WILL: We didn't get
the jury we wanted.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.439
And our client's product
isn't the most sympathetic.

06:14.470 --> 06:18.531
DIANE:
The opposing attorney is playing
up the sex and infidelity angle,

06:18.570 --> 06:19.571
so we need you to
take first chair.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.578
Because my husband
cheated on me?

06:23.550 --> 06:26.713
Well, yes. It might work
on the jurors who recognize you.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.071
WILL: You all
right with that?
Sure.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.418
ALICIA:
They're going
to want to use you

06:31.450 --> 06:33.759
as a punching bag, so we need to
limit your time in court.

06:33.790 --> 06:37.578
Also, we need some more
sessions of witness prep.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.824
_You're their
bIggest WItness.

06:38.860 --> 06:40.020
They're going to want
to put you on the stand.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.051
'Cause I'm
unsympathetic.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.964
Yes.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.059
And you're supposed
to rub off on me?

06:47.100 --> 06:49.159
The jury sees you
being friendly to me,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.031
and they think
I must be...

06:51.070 --> 06:52.674
tolerable?

06:52.710 --> 06:55.907
Well, I hope a little more
than tolerable, but yes.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.749
Funny, I think of myself as
very sympathetic.

06:57.780 --> 06:59.714
Well, you're
not on the jury.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.639
Also, we need to talk about your
posture towards the widow,

07:02.690 --> 07:03.611
the woman who's suing you.

07:03.650 --> 07:06.141
Do you feel bad for her?

07:06.190 --> 07:08.954
I do. I feel bad that
her husband's dead.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.185
_ I don't think she's
sumg me 'cause he's dead;

07:11.230 --> 07:13.198
I think she's suing me
because he used my Web site

07:13.230 --> 07:14.754
to cheat, and for
that she blames me.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.199
And you don't think
she should blame you?

07:16.230 --> 07:17.697
You blame the
beer for the DUI?

07:17.730 --> 07:19.595
No, but I might blame
the bartender.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.494
I thought you
were on my side.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.507
I am on your side.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.531
But the best way
to be on your side

07:24.570 --> 07:25.730
is to see how
the other side thinks.

07:28.910 --> 07:32.038
That's how I do it.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.139
You know there's a
porn mOVIe about you?

07:34.180 --> 07:35.716
No, I didn't know that.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.718
There's a porn
movie about you.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.753
And all the wives standing
by their husbands.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.520
It's a trilogy, actually.
It's like Lord of the Rings.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.255
(laughs)
There seems to be

07:45.290 --> 07:49.192
a whole subdivision of erotica
devoted to devoted wives.
Good to know.

07:49.230 --> 07:51.164
I hope you're
not offended.
Men masturbate

07:51.200 --> 07:52.565
to the thought of you.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.965
It's almost an honor
when you think of it.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.766
No, even when I think
of it, it's not an honor.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.778
Good work.
WaIt.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.643
Alicia, I don't want to lose my
husband and my kids' money.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.899
How many kids do
you have?
Three.

08:05.950 --> 08:07.679
Good! I can build
on that.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.814
Really? One of them has a
bucktooth. It's adorable.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.715
I'll see you in court.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.028
KALINDA:
No, no. No.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.741
I'll get back to you.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.805
That was Cary.
This cold case...

08:38.850 --> 08:40.670
we're going to
stay in touch.
Great.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.846
So, what's up?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.939
No, Kalinda. No.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.185
What?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.326
We both work here.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.851
We're both going to
continue to work here.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.697
So let's not talk.

08:54.730 --> 08:58.666
Alicia...
No. You don't
explain anything.

08:58.700 --> 09:02.761
You do not put a
single thing in context.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.771
You slept with my husband.

09:06.810 --> 09:10.701
You do not say anything
after that. You do not.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.775
It is selfish...

09:12.820 --> 09:15.778
to say anything
after that.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.052
I work here and you work
here, but that's it.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.751
When you can find
another case, do it.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.280
When you can walk
the other way, do.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.252
Now get out of my office.

09:28.660 --> 09:31.163
Kalinda, there are so many
people who can see us right now,

09:31.200 --> 09:33.964
but I... swear I will scream
at the top of my lungs

09:34.000 --> 09:36.798
if you don't get out
of my office now.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.319
(sniffles)

09:52.760 --> 09:53.909
(elevator bell dings)

10:15.010 --> 10:17.774
(sobbing)

10:41.440 --> 10:43.260
Hello, Grace.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.904
I thought I'd drop by,
and bring your favorite.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.370
I know your mom hasn't wanted me
to help out around here anymore,

10:51.410 --> 10:54.015
but I don't think she'll
begrudge my lemon mufﬁns.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.244
Hey, Grandma.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.781
Zach.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.845
H-how have you two
been doing?

10:58.890 --> 11:01.154
Good.
Yeah,
we're good.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.124
I'll tell your dad.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.084
He's... he's just so... torn up.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.792
Yeah. Mom said
he's in an apartment?

11:08.830 --> 11:10.127
Yes. She moved
him there. I...

11:10.170 --> 11:13.264
I think it's comfortable,
it's just...

11:13.300 --> 11:15.063
It's awful, though,
how quick it was.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.931
I_ didn't_ see
It comIng.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.130
Yeah. We're
good, though.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.876
I, I guess
I'm still trying

11:19.910 --> 11:23.300
to absorb it.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.840
You don't know what
your mom's thInkIng,

11:24.880 --> 11:26.142
do you?

11:26.180 --> 11:29.240
She said that they'd
give it a try.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.316
It was just too
much for them.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.817
I don't know why they can't try

11:32.860 --> 11:34.816
and still stay
in the same place.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.124
Just... just
seems odd.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.320
I think it's
just between Mom and Dad.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.328
Yes, but it's about
you two, too.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.998
I don't think we
should talk about it.

11:43.930 --> 11:45.898
NANCY:
Alicia!

11:45.930 --> 11:46.965
Nancy!

11:47.000 --> 11:50.959
Oh, I'm so thrilled you'll
be digging into this.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.001
We left things so
unresolved last time.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.928
I know.

11:54.980 --> 11:57.141
And I felt bad about
how that came down...

11:57.180 --> 11:58.499
Came...?

11:58.550 --> 11:59.869
What do you mean?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.978
How I beat you last time.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.947
Oh, you're so funny.

12:05.990 --> 12:10.029
DANA: Sean and I had this
tradition on our anniversary.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.756
We'd break open some champagne,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.189
and just watch
our wedding video.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.994
I know, old-fashioned.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.759
NANCY:
No, it sounds beautiful.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.438
I hate to_have to
get to thIs, but...

12:21.470 --> 12:23.461
When did you first learn
that your husband

12:23.510 --> 12:26.536
was having affairs on
SideEncounters.com?

12:26.570 --> 12:27.969
When the police
came to my house

12:28.010 --> 12:29.432
to tell me Sean
had been murdered.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.846
If it's not too hard for you,
what did they tell you?

12:31.880 --> 12:33.142
They showed
me his profile

12:33.180 --> 12:34.977
on... her Web site.

12:35.020 --> 12:39.411
NANCY:
And... this was your husband?

12:39.450 --> 12:41.054
Yes.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.057
Your Honor, at this point

12:42.090 --> 12:44.456
I'd like to show more
photos of Mr. BrIgIIo,

12:44.490 --> 12:46.822
but I understand that we
need to warn the court.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.896
HANDLEY: Yes, yes, thank you.
The images you are about to see

12:48.930 --> 12:51.091
are of a strong sexual nature.

12:51.130 --> 12:54.839
If anyone wants to leave,
please feel free to do so.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.360
Okay.

12:58.410 --> 13:02.232
These are from your husband's
private gallery on the Web site.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.168
And is this him
with another woman?

13:04.210 --> 13:05.472
Yes.

13:05.510 --> 13:09.241
NANCY:
And this is him
with two women.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.111
Did you know who
these women were?

13:11.150 --> 13:13.254
DANA: No. They're people
he met through this...

13:13.290 --> 13:14.882
Web site.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.478
And had your husband
ever cheated on you

13:16.520 --> 13:18.556
before learning about
this Web site?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.990
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.964
Oh, um.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.422
Yes, um, sustained.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.097
NANCY: I'm sorry that's
so objectionable.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.859
But you were happy, Dana?

13:27.900 --> 13:29.902
I think it's all right
if I ask that much.
I was.

13:29.940 --> 13:33.034
I'm not saying our
marriage was perfect,

13:33.080 --> 13:36.277
but we always told
the truth to each other.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.948
Until he found this site.

13:42.020 --> 13:45.945
Those pictures are very
upsetting. I'm sorry.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.514
Thank you.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.222
ALICIA: Mrs. Briglio,
who's Gina Wiggens?

13:50.260 --> 13:52.023
My husband didn't
sleep with her.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.596
ALICIA: I know. I'm just
wondering who she is.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.029
DANA:
She's a coworker of his,

13:55.060 --> 13:57.062
at his school.
She was always clinging on him.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.364
Didn't Miss Wiggens
bring a restraining order

13:59.400 --> 14:01.038
against your husband?

14:01.070 --> 14:03.004
DANA: Sean was the victim there.
She pursued him.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.166
That's what your
husband told you?

14:04.210 --> 14:05.962
Yes, and it's true.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.001
Because your husband
always told you the truth

14:08.040 --> 14:09.302
until he found
Stephanie's Web site?

14:09.340 --> 14:11.103
Yes.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.116
This is a certified copy

14:18.150 --> 14:20.050
of the restraining order
against your husband.

14:20.090 --> 14:21.318
Have you read it?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.055
No.
Would you like
to read it?

14:23.090 --> 14:24.523
No.
Because you trust
your husband?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.027
Yes.

14:26.060 --> 14:30.099
I took an oath and
I kept it to trust him.

14:30.130 --> 14:34.464
Your husband first logged onto
SideEncounters in April of 2009.

14:34.500 --> 14:38.038
Can you read when Miss Wiggens
brought the restraining order

14:38.070 --> 14:40.174
against your husband?
DANA:
But that doesn't mean anything.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.269
She's lying.

14:42.310 --> 14:45.541
French, circa 1660.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.118
And I start the bidding
out at $250,000.

14:49.150 --> 14:51.141
Kalinda Sharma.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.009
Sophia.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.086
Almost didn't
recognIze you undercover.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.284
So I should've known. You're a
big fan of pre-Raphelite?

14:58.330 --> 15:02.118
Yeah. I was, uh,
looking for some
home furnishings.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.195
Mm-hmm.

15:03.230 --> 15:06.063
What are you working?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.364
I-banker.
The first row, last one.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.697
It's the guy with the girl.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.605
Company thinks he's
bidding on blank checks.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.369
Really?

15:13.410 --> 15:16.072
Sounds fun.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.702
Don't patronize me.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.173
No, seriously.
Sounds fun.

15:20.220 --> 15:25.044
Wait a minute. I asked you.
I asked you to come join me.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.717
I begged you to come join me,

15:26.750 --> 15:29.150
and you said corporate
investigation wasn't for you.

15:29.190 --> 15:30.452
I changed my mind.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.253
And you said you'd
never change your mind.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.621
I was wrong.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.159
Take my position.

15:38.770 --> 15:39.520
What's going on?

15:39.570 --> 15:41.731
Well, I want to
try something new.

15:41.770 --> 15:43.101
Yeah? Okay, so why not

15:43.140 --> 15:44.732
go to the State's
Attorney's office?

15:44.770 --> 15:46.067
We both have
friends still there.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.202
Oh, this sounded better.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.730
So I was your second call?

15:48.780 --> 15:50.475
Offended?

15:50.510 --> 15:52.478
No, confused.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.741
We won't let you wear
what you're wearing.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.748
It's a very
corporate world.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.759
Well, I can adapt.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.224
I've just started a new
white collar division.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.454
I'm in.

16:04.490 --> 16:05.627
You don't want to
think about it first?

16:05.660 --> 16:07.298
I just did.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.495
That's not what I said.
ALICIA:
Yes, It IS.

16:10.530 --> 16:12.259
In your promotional material,

16:12.300 --> 16:14.996
you are quoted as saying that
your Web site allows couples

16:15.040 --> 16:16.132
to have affairs
without cheating.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.764
Yes, but I meant
it about biology.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.472
Monogamy is unnatural.
It forces the body to do

16:21.510 --> 16:23.649
something it's
not meant to do.
Be committed?

16:23.680 --> 16:25.307
No, be monogamous.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.079
Have you used
your Web site?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.269
Have I? Yes.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.344
So you've cheated
on your husband?

16:29.380 --> 16:31.280
It's not cheating.
We know exactly where we are;

16:31.320 --> 16:33.356
we know exactly
who we're dating.
And your husband approves?

16:33.390 --> 16:35.278
Not only does he approve,
I approve when he

16:35.320 --> 16:37.151
wants to date someone.
So If haVIng an affaIr

16:37.190 --> 16:39.021
keeps a marriage
from being based on a lie,

16:39.060 --> 16:41.051
why do you have a panic button
on your Web site?

16:41.100 --> 16:42.158
What?
Why does your Web site

16:42.200 --> 16:44.293
have a button that
allows the reader

16:44.330 --> 16:46.025
to hide the page to keep
anyone looking?

16:46.070 --> 16:47.196
Because you don't have to

16:47.240 --> 16:49.060
share my philosophy
to use my Web site.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.040
Ooh...

16:57.080 --> 16:58.172
(sighs)

16:58.210 --> 16:59.404
You give good prep.

16:59.450 --> 17:00.610
I wanna light a cigarette.

17:00.650 --> 17:01.776
Not in here.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.353
Don't delve too deeply into
the philosophy of your Web site.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.585
You have to offer
context, but briefly.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.258
It makes you sound like a crank.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.622
Okay.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.428
What?

17:20.470 --> 17:22.267
I don't get it.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.201
You don't get...

17:25.240 --> 17:27.538
how I can sleep with other
people besides my husband?

17:27.580 --> 17:30.401
Yes. I mean, why
even get married?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.702
I love him.

17:32.750 --> 17:36.174
Yes... but what does that
have to do in this context?

17:36.220 --> 17:38.814
It means I want to spend
more time with him

17:38.850 --> 17:40.852
than any other man or woman.

17:40.890 --> 17:42.312
I don't understand the reverse.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.386
How do you have sex
with just one man?

17:45.430 --> 17:48.092
Why would you want
to do anything--

17:48.130 --> 17:50.360
play cards, go sailing,
go fishing, whatever--

17:50.400 --> 17:51.594
with just one person?

17:51.630 --> 17:54.292
Because it would
hurt them not to.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.296
Yes.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.662
Yes, but that's not about
love; that's about fear.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.271
That's about jealousy.

18:03.310 --> 18:05.198
If you love someone,
don't you set them free?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.343
No.

18:07.380 --> 18:10.588
You like to tie them down?

18:10.620 --> 18:13.282
Yes. Basically.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.384
Aren't there men you look at,

18:19.430 --> 18:21.557
and you just watch them...

18:21.600 --> 18:26.697
in a Starbucks line, opening
a door, tying their shoes...

18:26.730 --> 18:28.334
and you just want
to grab their hand

18:28.370 --> 18:32.238
and slide it up
the small of your back?

18:32.270 --> 18:35.273
Or feel the touch of someone
else's les on your skIn?

18:37.280 --> 18:40.909
The taste of
someone else's tongue?

18:40.950 --> 18:45.114
The pleasure of
someone else's orgasm.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.885
Don't you want that?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.551
I have to go.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.564
Good work.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.871
*

19:44.480 --> 19:46.277
*

19:53.990 --> 19:55.753
You look tired.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.224
Thanks.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.296
Cary. You called?

20:00.330 --> 20:02.389
Did I?
Yeah. An hour ago.

20:02.430 --> 20:04.466
You said it had something to
do with Sean Briglio's murder.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.525
Oh yeah, yeah, no.
I just... I wanted to see

20:06.570 --> 20:07.639
if you had anything for me.

20:07.670 --> 20:10.309
(knocking)
Cary?

20:10.340 --> 20:11.807
Just a minute.
I'll be right back.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.501
Sure.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.627
ALICIA: I'm away from my
phone at the moment,

20:32.660 --> 20:33.490
so please leave a message.

20:33.530 --> 20:35.452
Look, Alicia, you need
to answer this.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.526
Nancy Crozier was
meeting with Cary.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.491
(beeps)

20:42.840 --> 20:45.900
I'm a bit old-fashioned
about these things,

20:45.940 --> 20:47.908
so you'll have to
walk me through this...

20:47.940 --> 20:49.578
Oh, I don't think
you're that old fashioned.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.498
Really? Thank you.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.472
Just... walk me through this.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.873
What is a triad?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.388
It's an open marriage
among three partners.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.638
(sighs)

20:59.690 --> 21:04.889
Wow. I'm just...
a Michigan girl.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.490
Fresh off the boat.

21:07.530 --> 21:11.318
So... So, Miss Engler, let's
turn to the victim now.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.496
Mrs. Engler.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.669
Married six years, so...

21:14.700 --> 21:16.634
(whispers):
Hey, baby.

21:17.570 --> 21:18.639
NANCY:
Sorry.

21:18.670 --> 21:22.538
Mrs. Engler, how did you
know the victim, Sean Briglio?

21:22.580 --> 21:24.502
How did I know him?
He used my site.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.677
You _never met
mm In person?
Nope.

21:31.650 --> 21:35.859
And... this credit card
charge to the St. Martin,

21:35.890 --> 21:39.929
February 16, 2010,
who were you meeting then?

21:39.960 --> 21:42.656
Uh... Who was I meeting?

21:42.700 --> 21:46.591
Yeah. Um, you made

21:46.630 --> 21:48.632
a credit card charge
to the St. Martin

21:48.670 --> 21:50.604
on the same day
that Mr. Briglio

21:50.640 --> 21:51.766
was meeting
one of his "dates."

21:51.810 --> 21:53.698
Objection, Your Honor.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.571
What does this have to do
with the plaintiff's suit?

21:55.610 --> 21:57.874
Yes, Miss Crozier, we seem
to have run astray here.

21:57.910 --> 22:02.540
NANCY: Well, Your Honor,
if Mrs. Engler met

22:02.580 --> 22:04.445
and slept with the victim,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.947
then this suit _
has even stronger merIt.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.958
Your Honor, we request
a short recess.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.628
NANCY:
But, Your Honor,

22:10.660 --> 22:12.457
I was just getting
to the best part.

22:12.490 --> 22:13.752
Let's take a short recess.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.451
I think we can straighten
this out. Don't you?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.388
(gavel slams)

22:18.430 --> 22:19.920
WILL:
They just found

22:19.970 --> 22:22.461
their murder suspect--
our client.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.129
Then, charge her.
If you have something

22:29.180 --> 22:31.375
on her, then charge her.
I'm sorry
I don't have

22:31.410 --> 22:32.604
enough chairs.
My office is so small.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.448
WILL: Come on, Cary.
What's your game?
I don't have a game.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.119
It's the game called
prosecuting the bad guys.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.412
You're feeding
this information

22:39.450 --> 22:40.781
to Crozier in
a CIVII case

22:40.820 --> 22:42.117
against our client.
Yes, and I understand

22:42.160 --> 22:43.889
your client lied
about not sleeping with him.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.557
Sleeping with him isn't illegal.

22:45.590 --> 22:46.887
You're right,
but killing him would be.

22:46.930 --> 22:47.521
DIANE:
Oh, come on.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.755
You think she killed him?

22:49.800 --> 22:51.461
I think I'm investigating.
DIANE: _
And you're usmg

22:51.500 --> 22:53.434
our civil case_to further
that InvestIgatIon?

22:53.470 --> 22:56.098
Well, let's just say that I'm
watching with rapt interest.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.177
Next time, call ahead, guys.

23:01.210 --> 23:03.701
I'll have cookies.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.547
You slept with
him, Stephanie?

23:05.580 --> 23:07.844
He was into S and M--
it was too hardcore.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.768
I-I told him not_
to contact me agaIn.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.185
Okay. What have you got,
KaHnda?

23:11.220 --> 23:13.017
KALINDA:
Well, as far as I can tell,

23:13.050 --> 23:14.813
the murder case
now has heat.

23:14.860 --> 23:15.884
They were trying
to connect

23:15.920 --> 23:19.549
Briglio's killer to a
serial castrator in Texas.

23:19.590 --> 23:20.796
That's how they
overlooked our client.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.048
Okay. Our advice has
changed, Stephanie.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.194
It's better to starve Cary's
investigation of your testimony,

23:26.230 --> 23:27.060
so with your approval,

23:27.100 --> 23:28.863
Alicia will make a
deal on the CIVII,

23:28.900 --> 23:31.801
and we'll turn to
defending on the criminal.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.876
What's going on
with your buddy, Cary?

23:33.910 --> 23:36.606
He seems_ intent
on screwmg us.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.777
I'm turning in my notice.

23:41.820 --> 23:42.809
(laughing):
Yeah, okay.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.818
What's the bump now?
Five percent?
No, Will.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.715
I'm turning in my notice.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.911
This is my two weeks.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.188
I'm not getting
into a bidding war.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.697
I'm not asking you to.

23:56.860 --> 24:00.864
We're going to make you
head of a department, K.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.960
We're going to put you in charge
of other investigators.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.807
Look, Will, when you hired me,

24:05.840 --> 24:07.979
I told you,
when I'm done, I'm done.

24:08.010 --> 24:09.705
I'm done.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.947
I need to try
something else.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.072
Where are you going?

24:13.110 --> 24:14.839
I'll help you find
my replacement.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.529
Um... not really.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.857
ALICIA:
Don't you want

24:24.890 --> 24:26.824
to take that offer
back to your client?

24:26.860 --> 24:29.749
No. My client already gave
me the acceptable amount.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.926
Which is?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.562
Darn it. _
You almost made me s|Ip.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.568
You have
a loser case, Nancy.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.805
We're offering you
the insurance limit.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.001
We don't want
the insurance limit.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.678
Where do you get your hair done?

24:43.710 --> 24:45.769
It's so shiny.

24:45.810 --> 24:47.209
She's not getting $11 million.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.275
I don't know. This guy at
the State's Attorney's office,

24:49.320 --> 24:50.878
he's been super helpful.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.888
He's been giving
me a few names

24:52.920 --> 24:54.057
that maybe I should add
to the witness list.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.682
What?

24:58.330 --> 24:59.854
ALICIA:
Grace?

24:59.890 --> 25:01.721
What's wrong?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.819
Nothing.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.622
Are... are you sure?
Is Zach okay?

25:05.670 --> 25:06.967
Yeah. It's not anything.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.902
It's... Mom, I want to talk.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.569
Grace, we discussed this.

25:15.610 --> 25:18.147
I know. It's-it's...
I don't get it.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.147
We're separating.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.774
We need to take a breath.
I know other kids

25:21.820 --> 25:24.038
at school who are told that,
and it's never true.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.216
It's just something

25:25.250 --> 25:27.912
parents tell them
to make them feel better.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.027
I love you, Grace.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.039
Maybe you're right.
I don't know.

25:42.070 --> 25:43.799
I'm hurting.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.239
Can't Dad help you with that?

25:46.270 --> 25:48.101
No.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.607
But Dad's hurting, too.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.845
He doesn't understand.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.279
Dad came by?

25:54.320 --> 25:55.810
No.

25:55.850 --> 25:58.239
He called?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.042
Grandma told us.

26:01.090 --> 26:02.250
She came over.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.155
I shouldn't have said.

26:04.190 --> 26:06.078
She told me not to say.

26:06.130 --> 26:08.997
Your grandmother... (sighs)

26:09.030 --> 26:11.328
Grace, listen to me.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.860
Your grandmother has issues.

26:12.900 --> 26:13.992
She's lonely.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.634
She'll be wanting
to come over.

26:16.670 --> 26:19.036
I need you to call
me when she does.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.675
Promise me you'll call me.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.678
DAVID:
I'll call you back.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.598
Okay, so let me start.

26:25.650 --> 26:26.947
Stop contributing

26:26.980 --> 26:28.811
to your retirement fund
until this settles.

26:28.850 --> 26:31.011
You have a salary bump
coming in two months.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.688
Ask to delay it
till next year.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.017
Make copies of your
stock options.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.152
Keep them here
at the office.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.055
They have a tendency

26:37.090 --> 26:38.079
to go missing if we
start proceedings.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.256
Talk to me about custody.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.622
Is it that serious?

26:41.660 --> 26:42.558
I want to know my options

26:42.600 --> 26:44.090
if I do something
to make it that serious.

26:44.130 --> 26:45.927
Okay.

26:45.970 --> 26:49.064
Uh, your children
are both teenagers

26:49.100 --> 26:51.898
and have a good deal of say
in which parent to live with.

26:51.940 --> 26:52.759
More than you might think.

26:52.810 --> 26:55.108
Do not become
the difficult parent.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.005
And you should document
how much time you spend

26:57.040 --> 26:58.905
with the kids, how
little time he does.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.077
And when I say "document,"
I mean a journal.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.042
What effect does a grandparent's
involvement have with that?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.310
Determining parental
involvement? None.

27:05.350 --> 27:07.284
It's all down
to the parents.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.958
(sighs)
Alicia...

27:08.990 --> 27:11.026
delay this fight.

27:11.060 --> 27:13.358
It's not a fight.

27:13.390 --> 27:15.051
Then delay this.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.125
He means more to you
in the State's Attorney's office

27:17.160 --> 27:18.798
than out-- on all levels.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.889
I'm speaking
purely pragmatically

27:20.940 --> 27:22.862
and, oddly, selflessly.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.667
Thank you.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.735
I'm needed in court.

27:28.780 --> 27:31.169
NANCY: And you were working as a
valet the night of the murder?

27:31.210 --> 27:32.302
Yes. It was awful.

27:32.350 --> 27:33.874
People screaming.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.138
And you saw... this car--

27:36.180 --> 27:38.284
Stephanie's car--

27:38.320 --> 27:41.050
the night of the murder?
Yes, that car.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.717
I saw it peeling out
of the parking lot.

27:42.760 --> 27:43.886
WILL:
My goodness.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.819
Why didn't you
tell the police before?

27:46.860 --> 27:50.159
Well, it's only recently
they brought me this picture.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.397
Hmm, well, thank goodness
it jogged your memory.

27:53.430 --> 27:55.898
Why are you here
and not helping

27:55.940 --> 27:57.396
the police arrest my client?

27:57.440 --> 28:00.238
I have no idea.

28:00.270 --> 28:03.979
Let's see. I've worked at the
Copycrater for two years now.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.147
I'm good with people.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.068
And you knew her
as a customer?

28:07.110 --> 28:09.249
Uh, yeah, she uses
the computers sometimes.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.282
NANCY: And these are the
computers that the killer--

28:11.320 --> 28:13.379
PrettiSpecial9--

28:13.420 --> 28:15.115
used to write her e-mails?

28:15.160 --> 28:18.379
This is where the police
traced the, um...

28:18.430 --> 28:19.852
what is it called?

28:19.890 --> 28:21.027
IP address?
Yes.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.152
Oh, yeah.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.122
It's our little brush with fame.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.228
But you didn't see
Stephanie there

28:25.270 --> 28:26.862
at Copycrater on
the actual day?

28:26.900 --> 28:28.731
The day the e-mail was sent?
No.

28:28.770 --> 28:30.965
All I can tell you
is that she's a customer.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.001
That's all.
RODRIGUEZ: The carpet fibers

28:33.040 --> 28:34.177
found at the crime scene--

28:34.210 --> 28:36.132
they are from a Socala
Tweed Stitch carpet.

28:36.180 --> 28:37.772
And the defendant
owns this carpet?

28:37.810 --> 28:38.947
Yes.

28:38.980 --> 28:41.778
And yet I'm still baffled
why you're here, Detective,

28:41.820 --> 28:43.515
and not at some murder trial.

28:43.550 --> 28:45.211
Can you answer that?
I can't.

28:45.250 --> 28:48.287
All I can say is that
the plaintiff subpoenaed me.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.252
We need another suspect.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.053
See what you can do.
Even the whiff

28:55.100 --> 28:56.249
of another suspect
will help.
Got it.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.995
God, this pisses me off.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.190
Do you think she did it?

29:00.230 --> 29:01.492
Stephanie?
I don't know.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.235
Doesn't matter
if she did.

29:03.270 --> 29:05.033
This lawsuit's
still bogus.

29:25.090 --> 29:28.218
KALINDA: A photo I took earlier
in front of the courthouse.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.455
A gray metallic Audi.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.367
Now here's Stephanie's car,
the photo used in court.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.231
It's what the
valet testified

29:35.270 --> 29:37.135
looked like the car
he saw racing off

29:37.170 --> 29:38.364
on the night
of the murder.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.833
Now, they don't look
much the same, do they?

29:40.880 --> 29:43.303
Until you put
it at the scene

29:43.340 --> 29:47.299
and put it under the same
fluorescent lighting.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.579
Who's this car
belong to?

29:50.620 --> 29:52.144
The widow.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.581
Dana Briglio.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.350
You can point to
her as the killer.

29:57.390 --> 29:59.984
You can't be leaving me,
Kalinda.

30:00.030 --> 30:01.452
You're too good at this.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.422
It's time to move on.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.166
What are you, a Dylan song?

30:05.200 --> 30:07.930
(chuckles)
You said you had my back.

30:13.410 --> 30:16.129
What do you want
from life, Will?

30:17.640 --> 30:19.949
What do I want?

30:19.980 --> 30:21.572
I don't know.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.349
Suddenly, this is about me?
(chuckles)

30:23.380 --> 30:25.883
You want the same things
as Alicia?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.514
Alicia? I...

30:35.330 --> 30:36.558
I don't know.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.227
There's a vast difference
between us.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.999
Because she's married?

30:40.030 --> 30:42.237
Yeah, for one.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.362
And she has kids,

30:43.400 --> 30:45.607
and I...

30:47.110 --> 30:49.374
What are we talking about here?

30:50.410 --> 30:52.105
She separated from her husband.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.541
What?

30:55.580 --> 30:58.378
Alicia--

30:58.420 --> 31:01.412
she separated
from Peter.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.158
It's not...

31:18.240 --> 31:20.265
There are too many issues.

31:20.310 --> 31:21.470
(sighs)

31:21.510 --> 31:23.239
I know.
There always are.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.306
Why?

31:26.350 --> 31:27.476
Why'd they separate?

31:29.450 --> 31:31.941
It's not public knowledge,
so don't tell her I told you.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.379
I'm not going to tell her
anything.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.285
You know best.

31:38.290 --> 31:41.225
(door opens and closes)

31:53.310 --> 31:55.301
(elegant music plays,
indistinct chatter)

32:01.750 --> 32:03.718
JACKIE:
Full confession...

32:03.750 --> 32:06.617
At one point early in
the race, I actually
thought Peter might lose.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.151
Excuse me.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.714
Sorry to interrupt.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.523
Alicia, hello.
What a surprise.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.686
Do you have a moment?

32:12.730 --> 32:14.459
I do.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.355
I know you've heard me talk
about her quite a bit,

32:17.400 --> 32:19.994
but allow me to
Introduce...

32:21.740 --> 32:25.460
Alicia, this really
is a surprise.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.229
From now on, Jackie,
when you want

32:28.280 --> 32:30.532
to come to my home,
you will call me.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.447
If you can't get me,
call my assistant.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.472
If you can't get her,
try again.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.486
Why are you so
upset, Alicia?

32:39.520 --> 32:41.385
Jackie, do you hear my voice?

32:41.420 --> 32:42.648
Do I sound upset?

32:42.690 --> 32:46.353
No, but these words
are so hostile.

32:46.390 --> 32:49.450
The next time you try
to turn my children against me,

32:49.500 --> 32:51.491
I will keep them
permanently off-limits to you.

32:51.530 --> 32:53.498
I didn't try anything.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.498
I... H tried to explain,

32:55.540 --> 32:58.031
because no_o_ne else
Is explaInIng.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.630
Jackie, I have come
to understand

33:00.670 --> 33:03.503
that you need
to hear things two times

33:03.540 --> 33:06.043
to absorb them,
so the next time

33:06.080 --> 33:08.378
you try to turn my
children against me...

33:08.420 --> 33:12.345
So disrespectful.
I watched over them.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.210
Yes, and thank you.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.182
That's why I'm not cutting them
off immediately.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.529
They're Peter's children, too.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.051
Yes, but they're not yours.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.567
He'll get custody.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.694
That's unlikely.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.539
He's the State's Attorney.

33:29.570 --> 33:31.629
Who banged a hooker 18 times.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.433
Let's see where that ends up.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.108
Oh, my God, you're awful.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.176
You don't know the half of it.
The next time you want

33:37.210 --> 33:38.746
to see your grandchildren,
you call first.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.472
I know what happened
in your house.

33:45.450 --> 33:48.317
I was your housekeeper,
you know.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.558
I have no idea
what that means, Jackie.

34:00.570 --> 34:03.391
VALET: Yep, like I said, that's
the car I saw skidding off.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.237
WILL: You saw this
at St. Martin?

34:05.270 --> 34:07.500
Yes.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.201
But this is Dana Briglio's car.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.175
NANCY:
Excuse me.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.643
Objection, Your Honor.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.318
Okay. On what grounds?

34:16.350 --> 34:18.545
Relevance.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.081
What are they suggesting,
that Mrs. Briglio

34:21.120 --> 34:23.213
killed her own husband?
Yes, that's exactly

34:23.260 --> 34:25.558
what we're suggesting.
Thank you, Miss Crozier.

34:25.590 --> 34:26.420
That's ridiculous.

34:26.460 --> 34:27.484
No more ridiculous

34:27.530 --> 34:30.249
than suggesting
our client did it.

34:30.300 --> 34:33.189
I think I have to overrule that,
Miss Crozier.

34:33.230 --> 34:35.095
You introduced
the car eVIdence;

34:35.140 --> 34:36.835
they should be allowed the
opportunity to refute it.

34:36.870 --> 34:40.431
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.438
But isn't the Socala Tweed
Stitch carpet fiber

34:42.480 --> 34:44.471
one of the most common types in
North America?

34:44.510 --> 34:46.705
That's true.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.378
And have you tested
all of the carpets
belonging to Mrs. Briglio?

34:49.420 --> 34:50.409
All of them? No.

34:50.450 --> 34:51.815
Do you think you should?

34:51.850 --> 34:54.284
Nope, I don't recognize her.
You're sure?

34:54.320 --> 34:55.856
She lives just as close
to your shop

34:55.890 --> 34:58.552
as my client Stephanie Engler.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.559
Well, I don't see everybody
who comes in.

35:06.530 --> 35:08.896
WILL: Good job.
Really good job.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.794
I loved seeing
Nancy Crozier's face.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.559
(chuckles) Yeah.
Thanks.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.578
How are you?

35:15.610 --> 35:17.578
Is everything good?

35:17.610 --> 35:20.443
Everything's good.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.549
You?

35:21.580 --> 35:24.743
Yeah, I guess. You know.

35:27.550 --> 35:29.518
If you ever want to talk...

35:29.560 --> 35:31.482
Sure.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.486
Good.

35:33.530 --> 35:35.691
I'm here.

35:35.730 --> 35:37.493
Oh, Kalinda, good.

35:37.530 --> 35:41.466
I want you to
prep Alicia for
the questioning

35:41.500 --> 35:43.365
of Dana tomorrow. Thanks.

35:45.970 --> 35:50.578
Okay, um, I'm still tracing
down PrettiSpecial9's avatar.

35:50.610 --> 35:54.239
It, it seems to be part
of a bigger picture;

35:54.280 --> 35:57.340
possibly two
overlapping drawings.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.315
Um, still haven't found
a match.

36:00.350 --> 36:03.353
Do you want me to get
somebody else to brief you?

36:03.390 --> 36:05.688
You mean someone
who hasn't slept
with my husband?

36:08.330 --> 36:09.649
Yes, you're in pain, Alicia.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.668
I hurt you.
Now do you want

36:11.700 --> 36:12.894
to know the facts?
Of what?

36:12.930 --> 36:14.397
I slept with him once.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.566
Now, I do that.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.568
It means nothing to me,

36:17.600 --> 36:19.864
but I do that.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.571
Look, Alicia, I didn't know you.

36:21.610 --> 36:23.601
I'd never even
seen a pIcture of you.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.642
To me, you were just
a housewife.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.898
Then I met you,
and I liked you.

36:27.950 --> 36:30.475
I liked working
with you.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.738
I liked talking with you.

36:32.790 --> 36:33.779
I felt bad.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.981
I don't like
feeling bad.

36:36.020 --> 36:39.387
Every step of the way
you just looked at me.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.454
And you knew?

36:40.490 --> 36:42.253
Yes.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.824
And I'm an idiot.
I never once thought

36:43.860 --> 36:45.623
that you were my friend out
of some guilt.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.559
Out of some guilty
welfare for poor little me.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.567
That's not why.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.706
I don't have
friends, Alicia.

36:52.740 --> 36:53.559
You were a friend.

36:53.610 --> 36:55.009
And you lied to me.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.407
You said, "That's not true"
about being with him.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.769
Yes.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.816
I'm sorry.

37:03.850 --> 37:05.909
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

37:05.950 --> 37:07.838
Oh...

37:07.890 --> 37:10.017
Now that we've
cleared that up...
. .I'm not .
explaInIng to justIfy...

37:10.060 --> 37:12.221
How was my husband?
Was he good?

37:19.400 --> 37:22.733
I'm... I found another job,
and I'm leaving next week.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.704
Good.

37:37.580 --> 37:39.719
Get out!

37:41.790 --> 37:43.610
(sighs)

38:03.840 --> 38:05.705
*

38:55.900 --> 38:56.719
What?

38:56.760 --> 38:58.864
Well...

39:00.470 --> 39:03.064
We're still confirming, but...

39:03.100 --> 39:07.935
we think your husband
is PrettiSpecial9.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.473
We think he was the one

39:10.510 --> 39:14.549
who wrote to Sean Briglio, and
arranged that last... date.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.145
And we just think you
should be forewarned.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.785
But I...?

39:19.820 --> 39:20.889
What?

39:20.920 --> 39:22.387
DIANE:
Our investigator thinks

39:22.420 --> 39:23.819
it probably was your car

39:23.860 --> 39:26.624
skidding away
from the St. Martin

39:26.660 --> 39:29.788
on the night of the murder,
but your husband was driving it.

39:29.830 --> 39:31.889
And the carpet fibers,
we think, are yours.

39:31.930 --> 39:34.797
From your house, but your
husband tracked them there.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.695
DIANE: And our investigator
showed your husband's photo

39:37.740 --> 39:39.958
to the Copycrater employee,

39:40.010 --> 39:42.729
and he identified
him as being a customer.

39:42.780 --> 39:45.044
You're our client,
Stephanie. Alec isn't.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.945
And that's, that's why we wanted

39:46.980 --> 39:48.709
to tell you.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.809
But why?

39:50.850 --> 39:51.942
Why did he do it?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.116
Yes.

39:53.150 --> 39:54.811
He was jealous.

39:54.860 --> 39:58.853
DIANE: Yes, the violence
of the crime scene,

39:58.890 --> 40:01.927
the castration, would suggest
some passionate emotion.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.848
He was jealous?
ALICIA:
Yes.

40:03.900 --> 40:07.063
Did you talk to him about
sleeping with the victim?

40:07.100 --> 40:10.092
Yeah, but I...

40:12.510 --> 40:14.034
I didn't think he cared.

40:14.070 --> 40:17.039
DIANE:
So, Mrs. Engler,
as your lavwers,

40:17.080 --> 40:18.843
we would advise you
to create some distance

40:18.880 --> 40:20.905
between yourself
and your husband.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.838
WILL:
It's legally smart,

40:22.880 --> 40:24.848
but also, it
might be safer.

40:24.890 --> 40:28.678
Either way, we're in a sticlq
situation with the lawsuit.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.052
The plaintiff can now more
clearly show culpability.

40:31.090 --> 40:32.921
WILL:
Stephanie?

40:43.940 --> 40:45.908
Okay, that didn't go
the way I thought.

40:45.940 --> 40:47.168
She's in love.

40:47.210 --> 40:48.700
All right, negotiate

40:48.740 --> 40:49.968
with Crozier.

40:50.010 --> 40:51.978
Let's try to keep her
liability to a minimum.

40:52.010 --> 40:55.776
She's gonna need it for a
good defense lawyer.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.242
You clearly got
Will Gardner's attention.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.544
He asked me how much
I offered you.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.751
And I figure this is when you
tell me you're staying put.

41:01.790 --> 41:03.985
That was your
plan, right?

41:04.020 --> 41:05.248
To get his bid up.

41:05.290 --> 41:08.088
You think I've
been using you?

41:08.130 --> 41:10.519
I think it wouldn't
be the first time.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.892
Hey, my case is done.

41:12.930 --> 41:15.990
I can start Monday.

41:16.040 --> 41:16.938
Okay.

41:16.970 --> 41:19.564
You'll have to hit
the ground sprinting.

41:19.610 --> 41:22.499
You're going to be going back to
the State's Attorney's office.

41:22.540 --> 41:25.543
Yeah, we closed a deal to handle
their investigative work.

41:25.580 --> 41:28.174
It's easier on their
budget to contract out.

41:28.210 --> 41:32.089
I want you to be my
top dog over there.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.111
(laughs)

41:34.150 --> 41:35.879
Okay. I guess that's funny.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.581
With Peter Florrick?

41:37.620 --> 41:38.951
Yes, he's the new
State's Attorney.

41:38.990 --> 41:40.127
He's bringing
everyone back.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.152
(laughing)

41:44.930 --> 41:46.192
I'm staying.

41:46.230 --> 41:48.733
Good. I need you
on the judge murder.

41:48.770 --> 41:51.136
So, what was that,

41:51.170 --> 41:53.206
your little
three-day walkabout?

41:53.240 --> 41:55.731
I wanted to leave.
Now I don't.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.077
You want me to stay?

41:57.110 --> 41:59.169
I do.

41:59.210 --> 42:00.871
Okay.

42:00.910 --> 42:02.116
Is this about Alicia?

42:02.150 --> 42:03.117
Is what about Alicia?

42:03.150 --> 42:04.219
You leaving.

42:06.750 --> 42:07.910
I'm not leaving.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.022
At some point,

42:13.060 --> 42:17.690
Kalinda, you're going
to have to confide in someone.

42:17.730 --> 42:20.062
No, I don't.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.694
You know what I discovered?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.833
I never have
to coande In anyone.

42:39.620 --> 42:41.315
DIANE:
The only client
harder to represent

42:41.350 --> 42:44.319
than a cop-killer
is a judge-killer.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.328
And forget
the adjective "alleged."

42:46.360 --> 42:48.999
Everyone thinks
our client did it.

42:49.030 --> 42:51.919
This judge was a beloved figure.

42:51.970 --> 42:54.291
Which means we're the bad guys,
so don't expect

42:54.330 --> 42:57.891
any help from
outside these offices.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.808
This is a high-profile,
heavy-coverage trial,

43:01.840 --> 43:04.172
and Childs is going to want
to make it his swan song.

43:04.210 --> 43:06.974
So I want everyone
to put his or her life

43:07.010 --> 43:08.739
on hold
for the next two weeks.
