12:21.498 --> 12:24.467
<i>Power Falcons win
this match!</i>

12:30.137 --> 12:31.403
You ever at a party,

12:31.438 --> 12:33.038
and the people are just having
a conversation

12:33.072 --> 12:35.173
that's just impossible
to break into?

12:35.207 --> 12:36.340
Yes, yeah, yeah.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.676
Sometimes, breaking
into a conversation,

12:38.711 --> 12:40.378
It's--it's difficult,
like getting into

12:40.413 --> 12:42.347
a-a double `utch
jump rope session.

12:42.381 --> 12:43.482
- Yeah, exactly.
- You know what I mean?

12:43.516 --> 12:45.451
You gotta pick the--
pick the right spot.

12:45.485 --> 12:46.719
Or--or people will
look at you weird.

12:46.753 --> 12:49.021
Just like--

Oh, [bleep].

13:11.243 --> 13:14.979
(groans)

13:15.014 --> 13:18.949
(all moaning and groaning)

13:20.952 --> 13:22.186
Whoa.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.287
(laughs)

13:23.321 --> 13:24.454
Hi.

13:24.489 --> 13:27.123
That wasn't--
expected to see you

13:27.158 --> 13:29.392
all undulatin' up here.

13:29.427 --> 13:30.393
Uh, hi.

13:30.428 --> 13:32.529
I just put my jacket
on the bed

13:32.563 --> 13:34.164
when I first came
to the party,

13:34.198 --> 13:36.433
but I didn't realize
that the party

13:36.467 --> 13:37.902
made its way
up here.

13:37.936 --> 13:39.303
But I'll get
that now.

13:39.337 --> 13:40.971
I will, if you--

13:41.006 --> 13:44.008
Carol, I don't know
if you're in there somewhere,

13:44.043 --> 13:45.743
but wherever you are,

13:45.778 --> 13:47.345
thank you
for the invitation.

13:47.379 --> 13:48.546
I really enjoyed myself.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.147
I'll see you
at work tomorrow.

13:50.181 --> 13:52.315
Okay, hey, sir, I think
I see my jacket.

13:52.350 --> 13:54.751
I think--I think your arm
is in the sleeve, actually.

13:54.786 --> 13:56.119
I'll grab--
that's not my jacket,

13:56.154 --> 13:57.688
and that's
not your arm.

13:57.722 --> 14:00.257
It's not your arm.
White people are crazy.

14:00.291 --> 14:03.226
White people are crazy.
just lookin' for a jacket.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.828
Sir, okay, yes,
Very nice mustache.

14:05.863 --> 14:07.497
I've never seen one
above the nose.

14:07.531 --> 14:09.733
That's interesting.
That's not your nose.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.135
Okay, sorry
to disturb you, sir.

14:12.169 --> 14:13.369
Just lookin' for
a jacket,

14:13.404 --> 14:15.505
just a ordinary man
lookin' for a jacket.

14:15.539 --> 14:16.706
You wanna say something
to me, sir?

14:16.740 --> 14:17.774
Are you try--
Oh, wait a minute.

14:17.808 --> 14:20.209
Mm-mm.
No, thank you very much, sir.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.778
It tasted a little bit
like salty butt hole,

14:21.812 --> 14:23.079
but that's okay.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.615
It's tweed,
the jacket I'm talking about,

14:25.649 --> 14:27.417
and it's got leather patches
on it.

14:27.451 --> 14:28.752
Just--oh, maybe
this is it.

14:28.786 --> 14:31.121
Thank you, found it, and--
nope, that's not it,

14:31.155 --> 14:32.522
but congratulations, ma'am.

14:32.557 --> 14:35.459
You are doing great
with what God gave you.

14:35.493 --> 14:37.695
Nope, don't look at me
in the eyes, ma'am.

14:37.729 --> 14:39.596
I don't want you
to steal my soul.

14:39.631 --> 14:41.598
Hi, ladies.
Very nice to meet you.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.166
And, sir,
yes, I do see you too.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.102
Okay, yes.
White people are crazy.

14:46.137 --> 14:48.738
Oh, no, I'm--I'm okay.
I really am.

14:48.773 --> 14:51.875
I'm already seeing
a-a group of people,

14:51.909 --> 14:53.277
And we're
taking it slowly.

14:53.311 --> 14:54.378
We are
taking it slowly.

14:54.412 --> 14:55.579
It's a church.

14:55.613 --> 14:57.548
Maybe some of y'all
would be interested

14:57.583 --> 14:58.549
in looking into that.

14:58.584 --> 15:01.118
Not mine,
but one somewhere,

15:01.153 --> 15:03.454
If that's--
Okay, thank you, ma'am, for--

15:03.488 --> 15:04.854
There it is.
I found it.

15:04.889 --> 15:06.723
Found the jacket.
It's right here.

15:06.757 --> 15:07.957
I'ma pull it,
and I believe

15:07.992 --> 15:10.694
it might be lost somewhere
within you.

15:10.728 --> 15:12.062
I'm just guessing
because that

15:12.096 --> 15:15.331
is just a little bit
of resistance.

15:15.366 --> 15:16.599
All right,
There we go.

15:16.634 --> 15:19.469
And you know what?
That is going to be yours.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.204
Keep it, thank you.
Cover yourselves up.

15:21.238 --> 15:22.805
Carol, if you're
in there,

15:22.840 --> 15:24.107
I'll see you
at the office tomorrow.

15:24.141 --> 15:26.409
Just bring the bowl.
You can finish the egg salad.

15:26.443 --> 15:28.745
My God,
White people crazy.

15:33.618 --> 15:36.620
Welcome to Metta
World News.

15:40.358 --> 15:42.359
I wish

15:42.393 --> 15:45.395
there was a genie
in here.

15:48.766 --> 15:50.233
Well, that wraps up
Metta World News

15:50.268 --> 15:52.603
For this Wednesday,
March Hybrid Ice Rink.

15:52.637 --> 15:55.839
I'm Metta World Peace.
Good night.

15:55.894 --> 15:57.940
Hey, Jay,
where is that genie?

15:59.903 --> 16:01.771
The spoiler alert
started in a--

16:01.805 --> 16:03.573
You know, pretty--
you know, not long ago.

16:03.607 --> 16:04.841
But now, everybody's talking
about spoiler alerts

16:04.875 --> 16:05.841
all the time.

16:05.876 --> 16:06.842
We hate spoiler alerts,

16:06.876 --> 16:09.278
and the thing is
do not tell me

16:09.312 --> 16:11.847
that you're not gonna ruin
the movie for me.

16:11.881 --> 16:13.348
But by you saying,
"I'm not gonna ruin it,"

16:13.382 --> 16:14.583
you're already ruining it.

16:14.617 --> 16:16.518
I know something special's
gonna happen.

16:16.552 --> 16:17.786
I know there's a twist.

16:17.820 --> 16:20.589
I know there's a twist,
so just shut your mouth,

16:20.623 --> 16:23.125
say, "yeah, movie was good,
pretty straightforward

16:23.160 --> 16:25.194
"beginning to end."

16:25.229 --> 16:26.496
And I've been guilty of it
'cause, you know,

16:26.530 --> 16:27.497
I'm the one--
I'm the person who be like,

16:27.532 --> 16:28.599
"Have you seen--
Did you see--"

16:28.633 --> 16:31.869
No, don't.
Dude, don't do it.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.604
See, now,
I know something's up.

16:33.639 --> 16:35.906
It's not--but listen, I just
wanna tell you this one thing.

16:35.941 --> 16:37.374
- Do you...
- It's--I swear.

16:37.409 --> 16:38.909
It's not gonna ruin
the movie.

16:38.944 --> 16:41.746
I'm already thinkin' what
could possibly happen with this.

16:41.780 --> 16:43.748
It's not--okay, listen, I'm--
All right.

16:43.782 --> 16:44.915
You know what?
No, it's good.

16:44.950 --> 16:49.554
- It's--I'm just--no.
- No, okay.

16:49.588 --> 16:51.289
All right, just--
if you can promise

16:51.323 --> 16:52.390
you're going
to tell me something

16:52.424 --> 16:53.558
that won't give
anything away--

16:53.592 --> 16:54.926
Yes, this is--
It's--it's not--

16:54.960 --> 16:57.662
This is not integral
to the story, okay?

16:57.696 --> 16:59.363
- Bruce Willis is a ghost.
- [bleep] you.

16:59.398 --> 17:03.334
(laughter and applause)

17:07.071 --> 17:08.906
Johnny.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.642
Okay, Carter.

17:11.676 --> 17:13.911
I can stay here
all night.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.314
So why don't
you and I cut the crap,

17:16.348 --> 17:21.085
and you tell me what happened
on March 15th?

17:21.118 --> 17:23.420
And what's in it
for Carter Finley?

17:23.454 --> 17:24.688
What's in it
for you

17:24.723 --> 17:28.726
is I don't send you back
to jail.

17:34.099 --> 17:36.301
(sighs)

17:36.335 --> 17:39.137
The guy's name
is Cat Branchman.

17:39.172 --> 17:42.908
I met him downtown at a club
called "The Clutching Kitten."

17:42.942 --> 17:44.309
You may have heard
of it.

17:44.343 --> 17:48.279
It's down on the corner
of Hang and Fur Street.

17:48.314 --> 17:51.583
Cat Branchman.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.719
So what's a guy
like you

17:53.753 --> 17:56.756
And a guy named Cat--

18:04.331 --> 18:06.632
(sighs)

18:06.667 --> 18:08.100
Okay.

18:08.135 --> 18:09.936
I know what
you're doin', Finley.

18:09.970 --> 18:11.904
You're just using what you see
in my poster.

18:11.939 --> 18:14.140
I'm not, Detective.

18:14.174 --> 18:16.008
I'm telling the truth.

18:16.043 --> 18:17.176
We'll see how much truth
you tell

18:17.211 --> 18:18.911
after a few weeks
in solitary confine--

18:18.946 --> 18:20.446
Fine, Detective.

18:20.481 --> 18:24.284
- You've twisted my arm.
- Now, that's better.

18:24.318 --> 18:26.486
The guy's name wasn't
Cat Branchman.

18:26.521 --> 18:27.888
Thank you.

18:27.922 --> 18:32.459
It was a Chinese guy named
"Mr. Meow."

18:32.493 --> 18:35.328
He's the real
gang boss.

18:35.363 --> 18:37.964
Story went he hung guys
from trees

18:37.999 --> 18:39.533
and took pictures
of them.

18:39.567 --> 18:41.968
- Finley.
- Used to run a club downtown.

18:42.003 --> 18:45.405
A front, of course.
Called it "The Paw and Poster."

18:45.440 --> 18:46.506
Finley.

18:46.541 --> 18:51.245
Ran it with a guy named
"Hong In Thar."

18:51.280 --> 18:54.115
Okay.

18:54.149 --> 18:56.951
Let's try this
one more time.

19:00.923 --> 19:02.557
Finley?

19:02.591 --> 19:04.625
Who do you work for?

19:04.660 --> 19:06.961
Um...

19:06.995 --> 19:11.265
Coffee.
Mr. Coffee Coop.

19:11.299 --> 19:13.567
You--Coffee Coop?

19:13.602 --> 19:17.172
His name was
"Baldy Tall Man Coffee Coop."

19:17.206 --> 19:18.206
(sighs)

19:18.241 --> 19:19.941
Now you're just talking
about me.

19:19.976 --> 19:23.678
Finley, I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

19:23.712 --> 19:25.613
Who is in charge?

19:25.647 --> 19:29.149
His name was
"Angry Man."

19:29.184 --> 19:30.284
(sighs)

19:30.318 --> 19:32.353
The warehouse is located

19:32.387 --> 19:37.257
in the diploma
for being a detective.

19:37.292 --> 19:39.326
- I want a name.
- Justin.

19:39.361 --> 19:40.628
Thank you.

19:40.662 --> 19:43.097
- Hangtree--
- Don't say "hang."

19:43.131 --> 19:46.133
God damn it,
Do not say "hang."

19:46.168 --> 19:47.334
- Hang--
- Nope.

19:47.369 --> 19:50.672
- Hangman Justin Cats...
- Finley.

19:50.706 --> 19:55.977
- Poster.
- Do not say "poster" or "cat."

19:56.012 --> 19:57.746
- Cat Poster.
- Okay, that's it.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.981
I'm losing my patience.

20:00.015 --> 20:04.285
Winslow, get this moron
outta here.

20:04.319 --> 20:08.322
(sighs)

20:14.496 --> 20:19.368
I'm losing my patience.

20:19.402 --> 20:22.805
Let's try this
one more time.

20:22.839 --> 20:25.774
I'm gettin too old
for this [bleep].

20:29.245 --> 20:30.212
(groans)

20:30.246 --> 20:33.315
Well-played, Detective.

20:33.349 --> 20:35.918
Well-played, indeed.

20:35.952 --> 20:38.687
Hey, Carter.

20:38.721 --> 20:41.890
You hang in there.

20:44.260 --> 20:48.696
Thank you so much
for coming out today, everybody.

20:48.731 --> 20:50.365
Thank you.
Good night.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.434
- No, no.
- That's not--

20:52.469 --> 20:55.237
No.
What? Me?
