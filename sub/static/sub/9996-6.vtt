00:01.640 --> 00:03.740
Hello? Is there anyone out there?

00:03.750 --> 00:07.390
Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me?

00:08.170 --> 00:11.280
Hello? My name is Joe Dubois.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.650
Is anyone receiving this message?

00:16.100 --> 00:19.100
I'm looking for Allison Dubois.

00:19.110 --> 00:22.150
If anybody's seen her,
this is her husband.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.610
Allison Dubois. Her
name is Allison Dubois.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.140
Still nothing?

00:36.840 --> 00:39.120
Oh,no,but that can mean
a lot of things,sweetie.

00:39.140 --> 00:44.040
Um,we know your mom is out there.
We just... we just got to sit tight.

00:45.260 --> 00:47.620
Dad...

00:48.110 --> 00:50.500
The food,it's all gone.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.850
Wait,how's that possible?

00:52.860 --> 00:54.970
I thought we still had
some energy bars left.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.600
Yeah,Bridgette and Marie
just split the last one.

01:02.960 --> 01:08.890
All right. Listen,Ariel, I'm going
to need you to watch your sisters.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.360
Well,wait,where are you going?

01:11.390 --> 01:13.320
I got to go outside,sweetie.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.620
I got to go find us some food.

01:16.370 --> 01:19.160
Wait,Dad! Please don't go!

01:19.170 --> 01:20.260
Sweetie,I'm not going far.

01:20.270 --> 01:22.410
I'm just going to check
the houses on our block.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.720
All right, they got to have
some food in there,all right.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.940
Please,Dad?

01:25.970 --> 01:29.810
Now you stay here, and watch the girls,

01:29.820 --> 01:32.730
make sure the house stays locked.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.920
No matter what, don't let anyone inside.

01:39.010 --> 01:40.880
Okay.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.990
Come here.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.820
I love you.

01:45.850 --> 01:47.690
I love you,Dad.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.410
- Joe,wake up.
- Earthquake!

02:26.420 --> 02:28.120
Come on, get the girls.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.340
Mom?

02:29.350 --> 02:32.710
- Ariel,get in the doorway!
- Get down!

02:34.960 --> 02:37.250
Quick,quick,quick,quick.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.410
All right.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.820
evacuated several homes following
reports of ruptured gas lines...

03:31.850 --> 03:34.760
Hey,do we know that
our gas line is okay?

03:34.790 --> 03:37.170
Mom and I checked
everything-- we're fine.

03:37.190 --> 03:39.330
You ladies eat or
we're going to be late.

03:39.350 --> 03:41.030
Maybe school is cancelled.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.170
School is not cancelled. Eat.

03:44.370 --> 03:46.880
Cell phones are back up.
Devalos just sent me a text.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.600
He wants me to meet him out in Chandler.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.050
Chandler? Well,you better get going.

03:51.380 --> 03:53.030
It's all right, I got
everything covered here.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.980
Do you know where the
batteries are for this?

03:55.010 --> 03:56.900
Uh,yeah,I think they're in the closet.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.560
The closet? Well,great. What if
there really was an emergency?

03:59.570 --> 04:02.300
What if it was in the middle of
the night with no electricity?

04:02.330 --> 04:04.310
What if there really was a gas leak?

04:04.340 --> 04:06.030
Yeah,I hear you.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.090
I'll tell you what,I'll
battery-up everything.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.710
Actually,I'll get new flashlights.
I'll get one for every room.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.030
Flashlights? We get flashlights?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.140
We should get some of
those packs that they have--

04:15.170 --> 04:17.600
emergency supplies with all the...

04:17.610 --> 04:20.279
the energy bars and the first aid kits.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.430
All right,I'll pick up one of those,too.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.830
One? We need like
ten. And we need water.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.570
Those big gallons so we can store it up.

04:27.580 --> 04:31.220
You know what? I'll just, I'll pick
everything up on my way back from Chandler.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.850
Okay,give me a kiss.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.750
Bye,guys. Love you. Love you.

05:03.240 --> 05:06.330
Appreciate you coming all the way down
here, especially after the morning we've had.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.450
I trust your family is okay?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.090
Yeah,they're shook up but they're okay.

05:09.110 --> 05:12.170
The one good thing about that earthquake,
is getting most of the press occupied.

05:12.190 --> 05:14.990
I think this thing's going
to turn into a circus.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.270
Welcome to Amityville.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.990
Matthew and Carolyn Donlin.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.370
Their kids,Jeff and Sarah.

05:29.150 --> 05:32.710
Signs of forced entry through
the construction in the back.

05:32.720 --> 05:36.850
Intruder enters this room from
over there,stands here, shoots.

05:36.860 --> 05:40.230
Police found the television on,
glass of wine on the coffee table.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.540
The father's watch and wallet
are sitting on the table.

05:42.570 --> 05:45.680
Jewelry box upstairs,
out in the open,untouched.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.240
Art's all here. Cars are
all here. No signs of theft.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.370
No signs of anything.

05:50.410 --> 05:53.250
According to our preliminary
background check on the family,

05:53.270 --> 05:55.200
it's hard to imagine a
motive for this kind of thing.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.450
These are hardworking,
churchgoing people.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.160
Is that why I'm here-- to
help you figure out a motive?

06:00.170 --> 06:02.950
That and one other thing.

06:02.960 --> 06:08.690
There are two more rooms just like this one,
filled with blood, just one thing missing.

06:10.740 --> 06:12.460
No bodies.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.390
Well,I can't say I'm entirely surprised.

06:15.400 --> 06:21.050
This exercise was supposed to be an opportunity
to boost your average before the midterm.

06:21.450 --> 06:26.650
And while some of you did extremely
well-- nice work,Ms.Dubois--

06:28.090 --> 06:34.090
there are still those of you
who don't even bother to try.

06:34.930 --> 06:38.360
So,let's review. Open
your books to page 45.

06:38.370 --> 06:40.400
Volume of prism.

06:40.410 --> 06:44.650
Who can tell me if the area of
the base of a prism is A or B?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.600
Hey,Ariel!

06:53.190 --> 06:55.850
Well,I have to get to class.

06:58.930 --> 07:01.190
Okay,then.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.670
I'll talk to you later,Ash!

07:08.040 --> 07:11.220
Hey,you know who I am,right?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.750
Okay,so,here's the thing.

07:14.790 --> 07:17.020
I know you don't know me but...

07:17.050 --> 07:22.480
I know you're really good at geometry, and
you probably know that I'm really bad at it.

07:24.100 --> 07:29.370
And I was wondering, there's the big test
coming up and all, if maybe you could help me?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.200
You finding what you're looking for?

07:32.210 --> 07:37.510
Actually,no,I'm looking for, um,those emergency
backpacks that everybody has at the register.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.440
Well,the individual packs
have all been snatched up.

07:40.490 --> 07:45.220
But if you're interested, We do have
some of the larger family size kits left.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.110
- They're right over here.
- Excellent.

07:50.040 --> 07:54.420
Each one comes with enough rations to
accommodate an average family for a solid month.

07:54.450 --> 07:57.060
Well,I have a family of five.
Do you think one kit's enough?

07:57.070 --> 08:01.100
Think of it this way,
They're not really supplies.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.350
In a way,they're kind of like insurance.

08:03.380 --> 08:04.610
How do you mean?

08:04.650 --> 08:05.690
Murphy's Law,right?

08:05.720 --> 08:09.700
The more prepared you are, the less likely
you are to ever have to use this stuff.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.070
- Um,excuse me.
- Sure.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.840
You're kidding me.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.000
The girls asleep?

08:30.030 --> 08:32.280
Ariel's still studying.

08:33.020 --> 08:36.330
- You okay?
- Yup,it's nothing.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.900
The important thing is
when the apocalypse hits,

08:38.929 --> 08:42.179
I may not be able to walk, but
I'll have plenty to eat and drink.

08:43.350 --> 08:44.640
Are you making fun of me?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.500
Not me. Not ever.

08:48.690 --> 08:51.220
Should I even ask how
much all of that cost us?

08:51.250 --> 08:52.770
Well,no,you should not.

08:52.790 --> 08:55.030
You should just think
of it as an investment.

08:55.070 --> 08:56.660
I don't know about that.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.610
When I make an investment, UM I like to
look forward to the day that it pays off.

08:59.660 --> 09:02.950
Personally,I hope I never
see any of that stuff again.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.070
I'm so glad you're back.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.110
I was getting so worried.
It's been almost a week.

09:54.950 --> 09:57.100
Geiger reading normal.

10:04.290 --> 10:07.260
Oh,my God! Peaches?

10:08.170 --> 10:11.200
Thank you. Thank you so much.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.290
I found a hospital. Plenty to salvage.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.790
I'll go back out tomorrow.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.560
Did you see anything else?

10:23.570 --> 10:26.240
Was there anybody else out there?

10:26.260 --> 10:28.120
No,I'm sorry.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.950
I got all the way to Tucson this time.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.110
It's the same there as everywhere else.

10:32.140 --> 10:36.110
Just like Phoenix, just like Tempe.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.530
Everyone's dead.

10:51.890 --> 10:54.250
It felt
so real--

10:54.260 --> 10:58.630
the hopelessness, the futility.

10:58.660 --> 11:02.270
And it felt...

11:02.530 --> 11:06.310
soon,like it's a tomorrow
that isn't all that far away.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.250
So,what are we talking,
natural disaster?

11:10.260 --> 11:12.450
I don't think so.

11:13.650 --> 11:16.810
They were worried about radiation.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.150
Maybe a suitcase bomb.

11:19.160 --> 11:24.640
I don't know. I saw two survivors, in a
bunker somewhere, trying to stay alive.

11:25.790 --> 11:27.840
You know,the weird thing.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.340
I met one of them yesterday.

11:30.380 --> 11:35.420
He was the owner of the store where
I bought all those survival supplies.

11:35.430 --> 11:37.260
Okay,you're not going
to like this but--

11:37.310 --> 11:43.210
and maybe it's because I'm just unwilling to think about
everything coming to such a horrible and abrupt end--

11:43.760 --> 11:45.950
but do you think this might have
anything to do with the earthquake?

11:45.980 --> 11:48.230
I mean,I know it really got to you.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.970
Is this maybe a way of
dealing with your anxiety?

11:51.030 --> 11:53.740
No,I don't think so.

11:53.770 --> 11:55.800
It felt different.

11:55.820 --> 11:58.460
Okay,let's say that...

11:58.480 --> 12:01.310
something terrible is going to happen.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.600
What do we do? Did you
see anything that might...

12:07.510 --> 12:10.540
help us figure out what kind
of precautions we should take?

12:11.140 --> 12:14.840
No. That's why I'm so scared.

12:15.490 --> 12:18.620
But you saw this guy
who survived it,right?

12:18.630 --> 12:21.040
So,I mean,he would know what to do.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.630
Maybe you should talk to him.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.570
Excuse me?

12:28.580 --> 12:31.030
I'm sorry to bother you,Mr...

12:31.040 --> 12:32.020
Who's asking?

12:32.070 --> 12:33.530
Oh,I'm Allison. I'm Allison Dubois.

12:33.540 --> 12:38.270
I
- I was here yesterday, I bought a ton of those family survival packs.

12:38.820 --> 12:42.720
Yeah,Russell. Russell
Burgess. Something the matter?

12:42.730 --> 12:44.730
Those survival packs
giving you a problem?

12:44.780 --> 12:47.630
Oh,no,no,no. It has nothing to do
with what I bought. Everything's fine.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.010
That's not why I'm here.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.460
Okay,then.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.710
You strike me as a man who
knows a lot about survival.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.350
So,I was wondering if,uh,

12:56.370 --> 13:00.130
If you wouldn't mind if maybe I could
just pick your brain for a couple minutes.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.600
You see,I grew up during the Cold War.

13:02.650 --> 13:05.930
And when the Soviet Union collapsed,
we all thought it was a reprieve.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.460
But then you had 9/11.

13:07.480 --> 13:12.000
Now we have terror attacks, suitcase
nukes, anthrax in an envelope.

13:12.030 --> 13:14.340
And that's just the evil that men do.

13:14.370 --> 13:20.240
You factor in global warming,
hurricanes,floods, drought,fires,

13:20.250 --> 13:23.260
any one of those is enough
to snap the infrastructure.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.280
We're going to wake up one morning
living back in the Stone Age.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.830
Do you really think so?

13:27.860 --> 13:29.270
Hey,I'm not the only one.

13:29.300 --> 13:35.110
A lot of really smart people-- economists,historians--
they see the writing on the wall.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.920
Population is growing just as fast
as our resources are drying up.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.950
One way or another, we're on
the verge of some very bad times.

13:41.990 --> 13:46.460
But we'll be okay,we've got
our family survival packs.

13:47.490 --> 13:49.160
See,and that's the thing.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.270
Supplies are only one part of it.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.400
Even if you're well stocked,
what do you do when all the people

13:54.430 --> 13:57.540
that don't have enough find
out that you have plenty?

13:58.270 --> 14:03.190
That's why the really well prepared
home,Mrs. Dubois, includes a gun.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.560
You wanted to see me?

14:08.590 --> 14:10.310
I did indeed.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.060
I think we may have caught
a break on the Donlin case.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.580
All that construction on their house?

14:15.610 --> 14:18.950
I spoke with the contractor,got
a list of the names on his crew.

14:18.980 --> 14:20.580
One of them didn't check out.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.920
Turns out,the guy's real
name is Lloyd Higgins.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.540
He was working under an alias,

14:24.570 --> 14:29.760
probably because he has a history of violent
offenses, including aggravated assault.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.560
Doesn't have an alibi for the night of the
murders. I was just about to go in and grill him.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.490
- Thought you might want to watch.
- Sure.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.570
Lee.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.530
I think I know where they are.

15:04.580 --> 15:07.480
I think I know what he did
with the Donlins' bodies.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.940
I really appreciate you taking the
time to walk me through all this.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.490
- It's no big deal.
- No!

15:14.500 --> 15:17.780
It is, and I appreciate it.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.070
So,would you mind doing a couple more?

15:24.080 --> 15:27.030
- I have a practice sheet.
- Yeah,okay.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.510
It's a test from a couple years ago.

15:29.530 --> 15:32.310
I asked Mr. Walsh for some
extra help and he gave me this.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.180
Okay,well,this is
pretty straightforward.

15:35.210 --> 15:38.420
Um,"The Mudville Rockets
are building a new stadium.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.800
"Three times the width of
the field is twice the length,

15:41.840 --> 15:45.460
and four times the length is
20 more than the perimeter."

15:45.480 --> 15:48.570
So,to find the
dimensions you would,uh...

15:52.010 --> 15:54.080
What?

15:54.400 --> 15:56.800
Nothing,just...

15:56.810 --> 15:59.980
I understand this stuff so much
better when it comes from you.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.980
I don't know if you have
a lot going on or whatever,

16:05.010 --> 16:10.120
but if you're not crazy busy,
do want to do something Friday?

16:14.690 --> 16:16.020
- Honey?
- Yeah.

16:16.030 --> 16:18.150
I need to talk to you about something.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.770
Is this going to be
a money conversation?

16:20.780 --> 16:23.410
I hate going to sleep
after a money conversation.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.830
I took your advice and I went
back to the camping store,

16:25.860 --> 16:29.040
and I spoke to the man about
being prepared for emergencies.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.120
Oh,no. You didn't buy any
more survival kits,did you?

16:31.130 --> 16:33.340
No,no,no,no,no.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.910
He pretty much got me convinced...

16:36.920 --> 16:39.260
we need to buy a gun.

16:41.180 --> 16:43.140
Well,say something.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.010
You hate guns.

16:48.680 --> 16:52.450
All the violence that you see, you
want to bring a gun into our house?

16:52.470 --> 16:55.050
Well,I don't want to,but I'm
starting to think we have to!

16:55.070 --> 16:56.930
And I know you're going
to think this is extreme,

16:56.950 --> 17:00.790
but I'm really starting to worry about the
whole breakdown of the whole social order.

17:01.340 --> 17:04.069
Excuse me? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:04.079 --> 17:06.710
Yes,you do. What if there was no police?

17:06.720 --> 17:10.500
Wh-What if there was no
public safety of any kind?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.099
Why? Where did they go?

17:12.109 --> 17:15.260
I don't know!If there was some
kind of apocalyptic situation,

17:15.270 --> 17:18.950
like a natural disaster
or a terrorist incident.

17:18.960 --> 17:23.900
How would we protect ourselves from the
people who haven't prepared the way we have?

17:23.930 --> 17:25.810
Wh-Who want what's ours?

17:25.839 --> 17:28.440
Our energy bars? Our chemical toilets?

17:28.450 --> 17:30.850
Uh,no,I-I'm not buying a gun.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.800
What about our daughters?
We have daughters.

17:32.810 --> 17:36.060
Joe,what if somebody
wanted our daughters?

17:36.080 --> 17:38.600
Okay. Mark this
moment.It's historic--

17:38.610 --> 17:40.600
you have officially left the planet.

17:40.630 --> 17:41.990
Where is this coming from?

17:42.020 --> 17:44.350
It's not coming from anywhere.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.650
I told you.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.250
I went to speak with that
man, the man from my dreams.

17:48.270 --> 17:50.460
Hey,it was your idea.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.780
I'm just... I'm trying to be
prepared in case of a catastrophe.

17:54.790 --> 17:56.570
Hey,you want to know
what a catastrophe is?

17:56.610 --> 18:00.470
A catastrophe is when a child finds a loaded
gun and it goes off, that's a catastrophe.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.420
No,no,no. We're not
going to leave it loaded.

18:02.430 --> 18:06.060
We wouldn't leave it loaded. We would
teach our girls, we would warn them.

18:06.070 --> 18:07.960
No,about the danger of a weapon...

18:07.980 --> 18:09.800
No,no-no,no. Allison,that
doesn't work that way.

18:09.810 --> 18:12.220
No,one time, one mistake and that's it.

18:12.270 --> 18:15.040
I'm sorry,but there's no argument that you're
going to make that's going to convince me

18:15.050 --> 18:16.900
to bring a gun into our house.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.340
Just think about it.

18:18.370 --> 18:19.600
I'm not thinking about it?

18:19.630 --> 18:22.250
Allison,do you know what the
numbers are,the statistics?

18:22.280 --> 18:27.760
Do you know any more dozen times likely you are to
shoot yourself or somebody you love than a home invader?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.130
Yeah,I don't care about statistics,Joe.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.190
All right,well...

18:31.220 --> 18:33.900
You don't know what I'm seeing. You
don't know how bad it's going to get.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.700
Yeah,no,I don't.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.350
And nobody does, and neither do you.

18:38.370 --> 18:42.040
All right,but I'm sorry, I'm not going to live
my whole life in fear of the worst case scenario.

18:42.050 --> 18:44.720
I won't do it, Al,I can't.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.840
I
- I can't do it.

19:22.860 --> 19:25.510
I don't want to live like this anymore.

19:26.390 --> 19:31.280
Come here. I know it's hard,
but you have to be strong.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.240
What's the point?

19:33.280 --> 19:34.890
This isn't life.

19:34.940 --> 19:37.410
We're stuck in this hole.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.650
I haven't been outside in so long.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.910
You can't go out there. It's
too dangerous. You know that.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.320
Look at me.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.390
We're still alive.

19:53.430 --> 19:55.290
We have each other.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.810
I know you didn't choose this.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.570
Neither did I, but here we are.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.340
We're a team now,you and me.

20:06.420 --> 20:09.320
But there's no one else.

20:09.330 --> 20:11.940
What are we even doing?

20:11.950 --> 20:16.410
What's the point if
we're the only ones left?

20:23.760 --> 20:26.310
We have to endure.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.570
The world needs people in it.

20:28.580 --> 20:32.270
Right now,there's you and there's me.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.490
That's for starters.

20:34.540 --> 20:36.850
And together, we'll just make more.

20:39.240 --> 20:43.660
I'll be Adam. And you'll be my Eve.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.960
Allison.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.570
You might want to join me.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.300
Of course.

21:01.690 --> 21:02.760
Lee just called.

21:02.810 --> 21:05.310
He mentioned some smokestacks
you told him about.

21:05.340 --> 21:09.240
He sent a team out there, and,apparently,they've
uncovered some human remains.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.650
Now,the media's already heard about it,

21:10.700 --> 21:15.370
and the mayor is pressuring me to
make a statement on the Donlin case.

21:15.380 --> 21:20.880
The trouble is, the body we found out
there doesn't belong to any of the Donlins.

21:21.770 --> 21:25.220
Found her in a shallow grave
wrapped in a tarp. Nothing else.

21:25.230 --> 21:27.820
Throat split from ear to ear.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.820
We know she's not a Donlin. Other
than that, we haven't a clue.

21:41.020 --> 21:45.910
********

21:45.930 --> 21:48.380
but now,it makes no sense.

21:48.410 --> 21:51.500
It turns out that she's
been dead for almost a week.

21:51.550 --> 21:53.330
Okay,and that's awful.

21:53.370 --> 21:55.580
But there is an upside to this.

21:55.620 --> 21:56.740
You can't be serious.

21:56.760 --> 21:57.990
Now,hold on a second,look.

21:58.030 --> 22:02.800
If she's dead now, there's no way that she's going
to be around to survive some catastrophic event.

22:02.810 --> 22:07.070
Which means that there may not be
a catastrophic event in the future.

22:07.110 --> 22:11.340
Right,right. And maybe you're right.
Maybe none of this is going to happen.

22:12.770 --> 22:15.010
Can you hold on a second,Joe?

22:15.020 --> 22:17.080
Sorry,but we need to take a drive.

22:17.110 --> 22:19.250
Lee just found the Donlins.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.190
Remember to show all your
work in the space provided.

22:24.230 --> 22:28.710
This is worth ten percent of your final
grade, so please check all your answers.

22:37.500 --> 22:41.150
"The Mudville Rockets are
building a new stadium."

22:53.690 --> 22:56.540
I don't understand. Why are you so
mad if you think you aced the test?

22:56.550 --> 22:57.960
Because I didn't really ace it.

22:57.980 --> 23:00.320
I cheated,and I didn't
even know I was cheating.

23:00.350 --> 23:01.910
Gavin tricked me.

23:01.930 --> 23:04.820
I don't know. On a list of awful
things, this ranks pretty low to me.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.300
I mean,you nailed your geometry
midterm, and now you're,

23:07.310 --> 23:09.940
like,new best friends with Gavin Coley.

23:11.330 --> 23:13.210
Place has been closed
for a couple years.

23:13.230 --> 23:15.000
Used to be a fairly nice restaurant.

23:15.040 --> 23:19.850
A local noticed that foul smell
coming out of the place, called it in.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.590
I don't understand. I thought
you said you found some bodies.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.940
W
- Where's the forensic team?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.190
Remains,I said,remains.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.460
I sent them away once I realized
what I might be dealing with.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.030
I wanted you to see this first.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.610
Is that what I think it is?

23:36.620 --> 23:38.370
Those are human remains.

23:38.410 --> 23:40.760
Partial human remains,anyway.

23:41.330 --> 23:42.880
What happened here,Lee?

23:42.910 --> 23:46.430
Best guess? Someone brought
bodies here, put 'em in the sink.

23:47.040 --> 23:51.110
Pour in the right concentration of sulfuric
acid, you can boil down just about anything.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.280
Oh,my God.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.540
How many people are we talking about?

23:54.580 --> 23:58.320
By the time I got here, forensics had
recovered this half-dissolved ankle bone.

23:58.350 --> 24:00.420
Appears to have belonged
to a young adult.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.860
Also found what looks to be a gallstone.
I'm guessing that's from the father.

24:03.870 --> 24:07.140
Some tooth fillings that look
pretty old, the young girl's hairpin.

24:07.190 --> 24:10.840
Are you saying that this...
sludge is the Donlins?

24:11.220 --> 24:13.590
I won't have proof positive
for a couple hours,but...

24:13.600 --> 24:16.290
Who knows about this? Does
anybody else know about this?

24:26.110 --> 24:28.280
He's white.

24:29.890 --> 24:31.160
What did you say?

24:31.190 --> 24:33.840
It's them; it's the Donlins.

24:33.850 --> 24:38.020
But the man who shot them-- he's not the
man you brought in-- the subcontractor.

24:38.030 --> 24:41.060
The man who killed the Donlins is white.

24:41.070 --> 24:43.890
And I've come all this way...

24:43.900 --> 24:47.320
just to drink your blood.

24:47.330 --> 24:50.390
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.710
Bridgette,are you playing with
one of our emergency flashlights?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.690
Well,Marie has one,too.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.440
Come on,girls,those
are not to play with.

24:58.470 --> 24:59.970
Come on,give it here and get some sleep.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.390
But we were just waiting for Mommy.

25:02.440 --> 25:06.650
- When is she coming to give us our kisses?
- You... give me the flashlight.

25:07.450 --> 25:08.810
Huh,your kisses?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.310
You already got your kisses tonight.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.280
Nuh-uh,not from Mom.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.480
She's been in her room
since after dinner.

25:15.490 --> 25:17.330
Mommy's sad.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.500
Mommy's just extra tired tonight.

25:19.550 --> 25:23.090
Come on,now,girls,go to sleep so we can
get a fresh start in the morning,all right?

25:23.860 --> 25:26.760
It's so hard to get it out of your head.

25:26.770 --> 25:30.220
What happened to that
family-- it was so...

25:30.230 --> 25:36.400
it was so cruel,so inhumane, like
someone just disposed of them.

25:37.060 --> 25:40.790
How could someone do
that to another person?

25:40.800 --> 25:44.140
To a family? To a child?

25:45.670 --> 25:48.370
Maybe you should give
it a rest for tonight.

25:48.950 --> 25:51.100
You know,it's enough
to put you off people,

25:51.120 --> 25:57.040
make you wish someone would just
wipe the slate clean once and for all.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.420
You don't mean that.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.090
Oh,damn it.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.880
No.

27:08.300 --> 27:11.920
Hello? Hello,is anybody home?

27:22.370 --> 27:24.270
Zoey.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.550
Zoey.

27:29.030 --> 27:33.390
What... What is this?

27:35.490 --> 27:38.170
Those people are alive.

27:39.150 --> 27:42.550
- Everything's fine.
- This is true.

27:49.100 --> 27:53.980
I'm sorry,let,uh, let me make
sure I'm following you correctly.

27:54.420 --> 27:57.170
You're saying that this man you met
somehow convinced this young woman

27:57.180 --> 27:59.110
that the apocalypse had come and gone?

27:59.150 --> 28:01.510
That's exactly what he did.

28:01.790 --> 28:03.420
This girl's been coming
to me in my dreams.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.870
I misunderstood what she was showing me.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.360
I thought I was seeing the future.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.800
Actually,I was seeing this girl's past.

28:09.820 --> 28:13.850
This girl's prints are in the system. We
should know who she is in about eight hours.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.420
Once we do, we can try and connect
her to this guy Russell Burgess,

28:16.470 --> 28:18.110
start building a case against him.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.740
I don't need to wait eight hours,Lee.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.490
I know for a fact,right
now,he killed her.

28:22.530 --> 28:26.480
I'm sorry,Allison, the end of the
world? That seems like a lot to fall for.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.970
This girl,whoever she was, was no kid.

28:29.010 --> 28:31.840
Well,she wasn't a kid when
she died, but in my dreams,

28:31.870 --> 28:35.270
it seemed like she had been
down in that bunker a long time.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.990
Who knows how old she
was when Burgess took her?

28:38.010 --> 28:40.230
Okay,explain to me why.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.160
Why keep this girl
alive all those years?

28:42.180 --> 28:44.310
Why would anyone go to all that trouble?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.720
He gets to be someone's entire world.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.610
I don't know, maybe he thinks
something terrible is going to happen,

28:49.630 --> 28:53.100
and he gets to add a girl to
his stockpile of provisions.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.000
I don't know.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.310
Maybe we should ask him.

28:58.660 --> 28:59.940
I'm sorry.

28:59.970 --> 29:04.570
I wish I could help you, but
she doesn't look at all familiar.

29:05.180 --> 29:07.990
I mean,she might have
come in the store,but...

29:08.000 --> 29:13.120
When and if you do get her name, I'd be happy
to look at the files,credit card receipts.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.480
Is there anything else?

29:16.510 --> 29:19.180
Before she was murdered,uh,
we have reason to believe that

29:19.190 --> 29:21.570
this girl was held prisoner
for quite some time.

29:21.620 --> 29:25.280
We think she may have been held in
some kind of an underground shelter.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.550
Given your line of work,
your interest in survival,

29:27.590 --> 29:33.630
I was wondering if you had an underground
shelter or a bunker of some kind on your property.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.920
I'm sorry.

29:35.960 --> 29:37.840
Is that what I'm doing here?

29:37.870 --> 29:40.470
I came in because this
lady-- a customer of mine--

29:40.510 --> 29:44.750
she called me up and said I might be able
to help you with some kind of investigation,

29:44.780 --> 29:46.760
but now it seems like you're
accusing me of something.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.090
We just want to know if you
have a bunker on your property.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.560
No,I don't have a bunker.

29:51.590 --> 29:54.480
I have a bomb shelter. It was
there when I bought the place.

29:55.470 --> 29:56.690
It's kind of a mess.

29:56.730 --> 30:00.270
I used to store kerosene down
there and we recently had a fire.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.930
You mind if we take a look?

30:02.970 --> 30:07.690
Be my guest, but you're not going to find
anything to do with any girl down there.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.020
Who do you think you are?

30:14.300 --> 30:15.250
What's up?

30:15.280 --> 30:18.010
- You lied to me.
- Really?

30:18.490 --> 30:21.630
See,I kind of think I just told
you what you needed to hear.

30:21.970 --> 30:24.700
I mean, you and I both know that you
would have never helped me with that exam

30:24.730 --> 30:26.680
if I admitted to you that I stole it.

30:26.710 --> 30:29.080
You have no conscience,do you?

30:30.890 --> 30:33.550
What if I tell Mr. Walsh?

30:35.970 --> 30:38.010
You're not going to do that.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.730
That might get you in
as much trouble as me.

30:40.740 --> 30:44.970
I mean,we both know that you're one of
those kids who has a great reputation.

30:44.980 --> 30:49.160
Works hard,gets good grades. Always has.

30:50.470 --> 30:52.100
So no.

30:52.130 --> 30:56.290
I don't see you risking all that
just to set the record straight on me.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.570
And besides...

30:58.600 --> 31:00.950
might make it kind of awkward
when we get together on Friday.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.780
We're not getting together on Friday.

31:04.090 --> 31:06.500
Whatever you say.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.840
Tell me something.

31:08.860 --> 31:13.080
A couple kids told me that you have
that sixth sense thing like your mother.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.310
I don't know, maybe I do,maybe I don't.

31:17.780 --> 31:20.760
Didn't do you much good with me. Did it?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.040
This one really doesn't
taste like peanut butter.

31:29.070 --> 31:29.990
How's the chocolate?

31:30.040 --> 31:31.850
Hey, where'd you get those?

31:31.870 --> 31:34.310
Oh,hi,Mommy. We found
them in the garage.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.170
There was a whole backpack full of 'em.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.840
I thought Daddy talked to you about this.
Those are supposed to be for emergencies.

31:39.850 --> 31:43.790
Well,how are we supposed to know if they're
any good if we don't give 'em a test run first?

31:43.830 --> 31:45.840
Well,are they any good?

31:49.360 --> 31:50.090
Hello?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.500
I just spent an hour going
through Russell Burgess' bunker.

31:52.530 --> 31:54.730
- I think I have black lung.
- What? Why?

31:54.740 --> 31:58.370
The whole place is burned through and through.
Smells like the inside of a smokestack.

31:58.380 --> 32:01.730
For what it's worth, there were no
signs of captives, recent or otherwise.

32:01.760 --> 32:05.620
Yeah,but that fits. I saw the bunker
on fire. That's how that girl got out.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.010
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

32:08.050 --> 32:11.580
I'm talking about evidence.
There just is none.

32:11.590 --> 32:14.550
What,so that's it?We're just
going to look the other way

32:14.560 --> 32:16.570
even though this monster killed a girl?

32:16.610 --> 32:18.780
Today we are,yeah.

32:18.790 --> 32:21.920
Oh,by the way, I don't know if this
is gonna make you feel better or worse,

32:21.950 --> 32:27.260
but,uh,we think we're finally
able to ID our,uh,mystery girl.

32:27.290 --> 32:30.100
We're 99% sure her name is Zoey Lehman.

32:30.140 --> 32:34.720
Her parents live in Tempe. They,uh,reported
her as a runaway almost three years ago.

32:34.730 --> 32:38.680
We're gonna need a DNA test to make it
conclusive, but,uh,other than that...

32:38.700 --> 32:41.640
hey,if nothing else, at least we
can give her family some closure.

32:41.650 --> 32:44.050
I guess that's something.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.560
Thanks,Lee.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.590
You okay?

32:56.600 --> 33:00.060
Well,uh,I don't think
the world's gonna end.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.800
It's sad...

33:03.010 --> 33:05.990
that's the best I can do for good news.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.560
They finally did it.

33:07.590 --> 33:11.990
All that weapons-grade plutonium out there,
they were bound to get their hands on some.

33:12.590 --> 33:15.890
I was friends with your
dad since we were kids.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.270
He knew I had this place.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.190
He asked me...

33:21.230 --> 33:27.500
he made me promise that I would
protect you, and I gave him my word.

33:29.010 --> 33:32.010
Easy... easy.

33:39.790 --> 33:42.440
You're groggy from the sedative.

33:42.740 --> 33:44.630
Your mom gave you that.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.390
She didn't want you to panic.

33:48.810 --> 33:51.720
Knew there wasn't time for a good-bye.

33:54.340 --> 33:56.440
I know you're sad.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.040
I know you're scared.

33:59.890 --> 34:02.450
But we're gonna be okay.

34:02.490 --> 34:06.070
We have food,water, everything we need.

34:11.260 --> 34:14.060
I need you to promise me.

34:14.510 --> 34:18.650
No matter what, you
cannot leave this room.

34:18.940 --> 34:20.989
It's dangerous out there.

34:21.040 --> 34:26.080
Radiation. Crazies with
guns. You leave that to me.

34:26.570 --> 34:30.949
I'll go and find whatever we
need-- supplies,food,medicine.

34:30.980 --> 34:33.980
And at night, I'll
be back here with you.

34:34.670 --> 34:38.000
And we'll get through this. Together.

34:40.080 --> 34:43.420
I may well be the last
of my family alive.

34:43.790 --> 34:48.610
And you may well be the
last Donlin... Sarah.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.500
But we're gonna get through this.

35:26.970 --> 35:28.560
We've searched every
corner of the place.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.290
No sign of Russell Burgess.
His home was empty,too.

35:31.300 --> 35:35.320
My guess is he got spooked when we brought
him in for questioning the other day.

35:35.330 --> 35:37.380
Odds are, he's long gone.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.080
And if Sarah Donlin's still alive,
he's probably got her with him.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.890
So it's true-- he killed that whole
family so he could take their daughter.

35:43.940 --> 35:46.090
Well,he's smart. I'll give him that.

35:46.370 --> 35:49.630
No one was gonna be looking for the girl if
they thought she was killed in a massacre.

35:49.650 --> 35:54.370
Well,we'll keep sifting through everything here,
but I'd be surprised if we find any sign of Burgess.

35:54.410 --> 35:56.790
He strikes me as the kind of guy
who knows how to fly below the radar.

35:56.830 --> 35:58.090
He could be anywhere by now.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.510
- Whoa,do you feel that?
- Whoa,it's an aftershock.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.890
Everybody watch out for your heads.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.530
Everyone good?

36:12.970 --> 36:15.290
Honey,dinner.

36:17.270 --> 36:20.010
Honey,did you hear me? I said dinner.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.430
I'm not hungry.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.810
Everything okay?

36:27.840 --> 36:30.290
You really don't know, do you?

36:32.080 --> 36:34.140
Don't know what?

36:34.180 --> 36:37.460
What I'm thinking. What I'm feeling.

36:37.900 --> 36:40.690
Oh,is this the part where I'm supposed
to say, "I'm not a mind reader,"

36:40.720 --> 36:43.380
and you're supposed to
say, "Well,yeah,you are"?

36:44.730 --> 36:47.760
What's the point of being able
to see things, know things,

36:47.810 --> 36:51.820
when you can't choose what you
see and who you see them about?

36:52.270 --> 36:54.960
Did you misjudge somebody?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.940
Did I ever.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.510
A boy,maybe?

37:02.530 --> 37:05.890
Seems like a cruel trick,
doesn't it? This thing we have...

37:06.640 --> 37:12.490
doesn't really help when it comes to people that
we're close to, people we want to be close to.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.540
Took me a while to figure out,

37:16.550 --> 37:20.580
but then I realized that whatever
it is that's speaking to me,

37:20.590 --> 37:26.580
it speaks the clearest whenever
I'm an innocent bystander.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.070
What's that old saying?

37:29.100 --> 37:33.140
"A pool of water won't reflect
unless it's absolutely still."

37:33.500 --> 37:34.950
Great.

37:34.970 --> 37:37.880
Yeah,actually, I kind of think it is.

37:37.890 --> 37:42.990
It means,usually,the
people that we love most,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.690
who mean the most to us...

37:45.700 --> 37:49.660
that they can pretty much count on the
idea that whenever they're dealing with us,

37:49.690 --> 37:52.190
they're dealing with the real us.

37:52.210 --> 37:55.880
We don't have any unfair
advantage in the relationship.

37:56.800 --> 38:01.660
And whatever happiness
or heartache we've earned,

38:02.160 --> 38:05.600
we've earned it fair and
square, just like they did.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.710
God,you're smart.

38:09.730 --> 38:12.560
No,I was just born first.

38:13.230 --> 38:15.580
So,dinner?

38:19.420 --> 38:23.170
Just keep thinking about Russell
Burgess and the Donlin girl,

38:23.620 --> 38:26.070
or where they are, or where they went.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.760
Well,something's got to give.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.810
And they said on the news that every
cop in the state's looking for this guy.

38:34.820 --> 38:36.360
I wish that made me feel better.

38:36.390 --> 38:38.660
He's been prepared his
entire life for this.

38:38.690 --> 38:43.110
He can live off the grid as long as
he wants to, as long as he needs to.

38:43.120 --> 38:47.230
And if she's alive,he's got
a 14-year-old Eve by his side.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.550
What's going on,Al? You okay?

39:13.560 --> 39:16.950
His footprints. They were
the same color as the paint.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.250
What paint?

40:20.690 --> 40:23.420
This is Detective Scanlon.
I'm gonna need backup.

40:23.430 --> 40:26.670
Local store owner, Russell Burgess,
was taken into custody today

40:26.680 --> 40:32.380
following an investigation that revealed
a hidden living space in his store.

40:32.410 --> 40:36.530
Now,Burgess was apparently using
the space to keep a 14-year-old girl,

40:36.570 --> 40:41.550
believed to be the lone survivor of
the massacred Donlin family,prisoner.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.800
That poor girl.

40:43.810 --> 40:45.720
What do you think's gonna happen to her?

40:45.750 --> 40:48.630
She's got extended
family, thank goodness.

40:49.090 --> 40:53.470
I was at the hospital when they
went to visit her, and she looked...

40:53.480 --> 40:56.980
so happy. She looked so relieved.

40:58.780 --> 41:02.130
And then,there was something
else, this look in her eye...

41:02.140 --> 41:05.050
like at any moment...

41:05.440 --> 41:08.280
it could all be taken away.

41:08.290 --> 41:10.600
Wonder how long that will last.

41:10.630 --> 41:14.580
For Sarah Donlin? I don't know.

41:15.780 --> 41:20.300
You know, you can plan and prepare
for when things go wrong up to a point,

41:20.340 --> 41:24.010
but then you just got to live as best
you can in the moments you're given.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.900
That was damned profound.

41:30.930 --> 41:32.750
Thank you,would you like another?

41:32.780 --> 41:35.060
A stitch in time saves nine.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.940
You don't say.

41:36.960 --> 41:40.190
'Tis better to give than to receive.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.390
I don't know about that.

41:43.430 --> 41:47.130
A red sky at morning,
sailors take warning.

41:47.170 --> 41:50.660
Red sky at night, sailors take flight.

41:50.670 --> 41:52.400
Okey**
