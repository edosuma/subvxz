WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:10.920
What an atmosphere there is

00:10.920 --> 00:13.200
in the Chelsea stadium today.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.960
He keeps on working
to win Chelsea a corner.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.840
He didn't make the clearance.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.040
The ball quickly found
its way in Chelsea's half.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.720
The goalkeeper
was helpless there.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.520
That is one of <i>the</i> goals
of the season.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
He finished it well,
but the quality

00:27.520 --> 00:29.720
of the pass was astounding.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.680
And that will surely be the goal
that takes Chelsea to Wembley.

00:32.680 --> 00:34.480
The referee is looking
at his watch.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.360
It's been
another dominant performance

00:36.360 --> 00:38.080
by a resurgent Chelsea,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.640
who have their sights firmly
set on Europe next year.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.640
And that's it.
The result was never in doubt,

00:43.640 --> 00:44.960
but what a performance.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.920
Chelsea at
their magisterial best.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.120
You all right? Yeah.
All right.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.880
Mind if I get a selfie?
Yeah, come on.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.920
MAN #2: There he is.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.240
All right, take it easy, boys.
See you later, yeah?

01:01.440 --> 01:02.760
Never lose it, huh?
Never lose it.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.920
Fancy a pint?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.560
Might as well.
You've twisted my arm.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.760
See if you can finish
your meal tonight, eh?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.960
You should get off.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.400
<i>After today's game,</i> <i>
the thorny subject of violence</i>

01:55.400 --> 01:57.760
<i>from a tiny minority</i> <i>
of football supporters</i>

01:57.760 --> 01:59.520
<i>- is raised once again.</i>
- MAN #2: <i>First the report</i>

01:59.520 --> 02:01.880
<i>of minor scuffles</i> <i>
after the game.</i>

02:01.880 --> 02:03.760
<i>We cannot allow</i> <i>
these inferior elements</i>

02:03.760 --> 02:06.400
<i>to cast a shadow over a</i> <i>
glorious afternoon for Chelsea.</i>

02:06.400 --> 02:07.560
MAN #3: <i>Absolutely.</i>

02:19.760 --> 02:21.440
All right there?
Yeah.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.160
Everything is shipshape, boss.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.960
Another Chelsea win.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.080
Watch out for
the usual drunks later on.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.040
Hm.
Let 'em try something.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.520
Oh.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.920
Oh, gosh.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.560
Oh...

05:32.960 --> 05:35.440
Milk, two sugars.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.680
How are you feeling?

05:36.680 --> 05:39.200
- Late.
- Oh. Good game, eh?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.920
Chelsea on form.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.720
- It's almost like the old days.
- I wouldn't go that far.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.760
Still missing a certain
something in midfield.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.480
Or a certain <i>someone.</i>

05:49.480 --> 05:51.680
Modesty forbids.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.200
Listen, Carsten,
I'm gonna have to dash.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.440
You might find some bread
in this cupboard

05:57.440 --> 05:59.960
if the mice
haven't got there first.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.200
Ah, thanks, mate.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.040
Nice gaff, by the way.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.520
Oh, are we swaying slightly,

06:06.520 --> 06:08.840
or did we have one
too many pints after the game?

06:08.840 --> 06:11.720
Drop the latch on your way out.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.240
You're up?

06:59.680 --> 07:01.880
Police.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.840
Thank you.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.120
Oh.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.040
Not too close, please.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.440
According to the photo I.D.,
his name's Steve O'Hara.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.200
Appears to work at Cooper's,
the building supplies place.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.760
Do we know what time, Ashley?

07:38.760 --> 07:40.280
Early hours of the morning.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.760
It's difficult to be precise.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.040
I'd say between 1:00 a.m.
and 4:00 a.m.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.840
This was lying beside him
on the ground.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.360
And this.
It looks like drugs.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.760
There's also a mobile phone.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.600
Given the amount of blood loss,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.160
he probably wouldn't have lasted
more than a few minutes.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.800
There are
no obvious defense injuries.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.760
We're not well served for
CCTV 'round here, I'm afraid.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.920
So this is what?
A random attack?

08:24.920 --> 08:26.640
Did they know each other?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.040
Had they arranged to meet?

08:28.040 --> 08:30.040
This was in his jacket.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.720
Brinston Close.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.280
Thanks, Ashley.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.680
Let's you and I do next of kin.

08:38.680 --> 08:42.520
We'll get Connor and Jess
on crime scene and witnesses.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.000
We're looking for
Siobhan O'Hara.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.280
It's not a good moment.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.880
We need to see Mrs. O'Hara.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.200
It's about her husband.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.720
Come in.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.040
Mrs. O'Hara?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.880
I'm D.I. Arnold,
and this is D.S. Shamsie

09:34.880 --> 09:37.960
from Chelsea police station.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.080
Can I confirm that
you're married to Steve O'Hara?

09:42.680 --> 09:44.200
Yes, she is.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.240
I have to tell you, a very
serious assault has taken place.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.720
And we believe the victim
to be your husband.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.120
It appears to have been
a knife attack.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.600
We're so sorry,
but he didn't survive.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.280
Mrs. O'Hara, can you think
of any reason

10:05.280 --> 10:08.000
why anyone would
have wanted to harm Steve?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.400
Anyone he knew?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.760
It's okay.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.080
Excuse me.
Could I have a word?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.000
It's fine.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.240
Sorry. You are?

10:24.240 --> 10:26.040
Paulo Mendez.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.920
I'm her nurse.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.200
Were you with her last night,
Mr. Mendez?

10:30.200 --> 10:33.840
No.
Um, I only work days.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.480
What time did you leave?

10:36.520 --> 10:39.520
Just after Steve left for work.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.040
7:00.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.760
Mrs. O'Hara, at the scene
we found a quantity of drugs.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.400
Can you think of any reason
for that?

10:49.400 --> 10:53.240
Nobody would have hurt Steve.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.760
Everybody loved him. Everybody.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.560
He was a hero.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.080
No. No.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.040
He was <i>my</i> hero.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.440
No. No.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.360
No.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.080
You do realize
Siobhan is unwell?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.320
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.760
Steve's worked here for ages.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.360
He's the night security guy.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.200
I said goodbye to him
when I left yesterday evening.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.640
But this morning,
I couldn't find him.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.240
Any idea why he'd leave
the premises

11:48.240 --> 11:49.960
in the middle of the night?

11:51.640 --> 11:55.440
The thing is,
Steve and Siobhan -- his wife --

11:55.440 --> 11:57.480
they only live
five minutes away.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.240
And Siobhan's got cancer.
She hasn't got long to go.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.840
Steve would sometimes visit her
when things were quiet,

12:03.840 --> 12:05.200
just to check on her.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.360
Was that allowed?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.960
Well, I turned a blind eye.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.040
You've got CCTV presumably?

12:11.040 --> 12:13.160
Sure. Yeah.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.480
Where were you last night,
Mr. Sylvester?

12:15.480 --> 12:18.160
Just at home.
With my family.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.800
We saw a "Local Hero"
certificate he got.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.400
What do you know about that?

12:23.400 --> 12:26.400
Yeah, that was Steve all over.
He was so proud.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.240
Chased a bunch of kids
who were dealing drugs.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.880
What do you call it --
a citizen's arrest?

12:31.880 --> 12:34.240
Very anti-drugs, was he?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.040
Steve?

12:36.040 --> 12:37.240
Definitely.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.200
So the attack took place here,

12:41.200 --> 12:42.840
pretty much midway
between Cooper's,

12:42.840 --> 12:44.160
where Steve O'Hara worked,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.440
and Brinston Close,
where he lived.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.680
Around 3:00 in the morning,
give or take.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.560
His wife, Siobhan, is ill,
and his boss said Steve

12:51.560 --> 12:53.680
made it a habit of popping home
in the middle of the night.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.520
- We'll need to corroborate that.
- Will do.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.120
Found at the scene --
this and this.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.360
I checked out
this "Local Hero" thing.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.000
O'Hara chased and caught
a gang of teenagers

13:03.000 --> 13:04.840
he saw with cocaine.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.240
One kid got nicked --
Finn Davidson.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.760
Then there's Steve's boss,
Artie Sylvester.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.480
We've already spoken to him,
but we should follow up,

13:11.480 --> 13:13.720
see what he has to say.
And finally,

13:13.720 --> 13:17.480
Siobhan has a palliative care
nurse, Paulo Mendez.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.440
Usual background checks.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.440
Right. House-to-house.
CCTV. Phone records.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.000
And we need to find this
Finn Davidson. Let's get busy.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.040
Yeah.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.200
Siobhan.

13:42.200 --> 13:46.360
I made up something
a bit stronger than usual.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.440
I just think you need it.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.760
You've had a shock.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.760
A shock?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.920
My husband is dead.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.200
What can you tell us, Ashley?

14:35.200 --> 14:38.200
Entry point here,
in the lower abdomen,

14:38.200 --> 14:42.480
likely traveling up through
the organs and into the aorta.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.000
A perfect example

14:44.000 --> 14:46.440
of how a single stab wound
can prove fatal.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.360
The angle makes me think

14:48.360 --> 14:50.560
the assailant was
very close to the victim.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.080
Like this.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.920
There's also an injury
on the side of his head

14:58.920 --> 15:02.520
caused by a blunt instrument
which hasn't been recovered.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.440
Likely made
before the stab wound.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.760
You said there were
no defensive injuries?

15:07.760 --> 15:09.880
No.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.720
Someone he knew, then.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.240
Probably.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.480
Look, he's a big fellow, right?

15:18.480 --> 15:20.960
He could chase down
a gang of teenagers,

15:20.960 --> 15:23.360
but not save himself from this?

15:23.360 --> 15:24.200
Hmm.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.560
The murder weapon
has the dimensions

15:28.560 --> 15:32.400
of an ordinary kitchen knife --
the one we found at the scene.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.760
Blood spatter would
have been significant.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.040
We found his keys and
the wallet that you've seen,

15:38.040 --> 15:40.600
which didn't contain any money.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.880
Though there was £500 in cash
in the portacabin.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.240
So you stab someone
you're selling drugs to,

15:48.240 --> 15:51.960
panic, and leave the knife
and drugs at the scene.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.120
Well, that's assuming Steve
was buying, instead of selling.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.720
Although apparently he didn't
want anything to do

15:56.720 --> 15:59.200
- with drugs, at all.
- Apparently.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.200
Interesting collection
of tattoos.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.440
Never quite seen
the appeal myself.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.560
Oh, I don't know.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.520
What, have you...?

16:12.560 --> 16:14.200
I don't think that's
any of your business, sir.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.000
No. No. Sorry.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.280
Poor Siobhan.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.040
Ready?

16:51.360 --> 16:54.040
Sir. Sorry.
Thank you.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.920
Hi.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.440
Sad business.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.920
Yeah.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.280
Who'd have believed it, eh?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.040
Such a lovely man.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.720
Were you a friend?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.000
Shh.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.920
When does she move
into her own room?

18:22.920 --> 18:25.040
Uh, just before university.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.800
- Mm.
- Mm.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.200
Are you gonna finish
painting it?

18:29.200 --> 18:30.720
Yeah, I'll do it this weekend.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.600
- I can do it myself if you like.
- No.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.520
No, because decorating
is <i>my</i> thing.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.600
Mm.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.920
What shade are we going for?

18:40.920 --> 18:43.920
Um...the middle one?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.960
Because it's not too dark
and it's not too light.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.840
Right. Right.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.360
You don't think we should
just go for pink?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.920
- No.
- No?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.440
We're not doing it
to please your mother.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.440
What?

19:38.200 --> 19:39.880
Oh, come on.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.400
- Ashley. <i>
- Good morning, Max.</i>

20:05.400 --> 20:07.720
<i>I've got some initial findings</i> <i>
from the crime scene.</i>

20:07.720 --> 20:09.440
Give me a moment.
Most unusually,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.480
I've got
a problem with the plumbing.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.680
Go on.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.440
<i>Nothing exciting to report,</i> <i>
I'm afraid.</i>

20:25.440 --> 20:28.240
<i>The drugs</i> <i>
were a heroin-fentanyl mix.</i>

20:28.240 --> 20:31.360
Whatever happened
to good old pure heroin?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.960
<i>I didn't get that, Max.</i>

20:32.960 --> 20:34.280
- Oh. <i>
- Lips.</i>

20:34.280 --> 20:36.720
What about the surrounding area?

20:36.720 --> 20:38.080
- <i>
- Tricky.</i>

20:38.960 --> 20:42.480
<i>The place is a piece</i> <i>
of waste ground.</i>

20:42.480 --> 20:44.040
<i>People dump their rubbish</i> <i>
there.</i>

20:44.040 --> 20:45.640
<i>The DNA's a mess.</i>

20:45.640 --> 20:46.880
<i>But we're on it.</i>

20:46.880 --> 20:48.480
That's great, Ashley.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.040
<i>- Well, I...</i>
- We'll speak soon, okay?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.200
Astrid.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.520
What a surprise.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.880
A nice one, I hope.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.920
I thought I'd just pop by.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.440
Uh...

21:06.440 --> 21:07.800
Sorry.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.600
Mm.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.280
Can I get you anything?

21:13.280 --> 21:15.040
Perhaps a glass of water.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.240
Are you keeping up
with your piano practice?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.120
I've got a lot of free evenings.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.200
Um, I'm sorry.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.080
Oh.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.400
Max, we need to discuss this
business of selling the flat.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.760
What business?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.880
What we agreed.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.200
What you suggested.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.720
It's <i>our</i> flat, Astrid.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.240
Yeah, well, I've spoken
to a couple of estate agents,

21:51.240 --> 21:54.040
and here are the brochures.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.320
So you weren't just popping by?

21:59.120 --> 22:00.680
Max, you know what you're like.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.920
You bury your head in the sand.

22:02.920 --> 22:03.960
We just need to move forward.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.120
Then it'll seem better.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.000
Morning.
Am I running slightly late?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.240
Don't worry. Morning.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.280
Here's our suspect, boss.
Finn Davidson.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.800
Everything's in this file.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.480
Interesting reading.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.080
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.520
Are you the detectives?

23:18.520 --> 23:20.120
<i>I've been waiting for hours.</i>

23:20.120 --> 23:21.240
<i>I mean, God knows</i> <i>
what this is about,</i>

23:21.240 --> 23:23.200
<i>but I've got stuff to do.</i>

23:23.200 --> 23:25.520
- What do you think? <i>
- Can we get on with it?</i>

23:26.600 --> 23:30.320
Well, I reckon Mummy
and Daddy paid for the brief.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.920
Do you know this man?

23:33.920 --> 23:36.120
Steve O'Hara?

23:36.120 --> 23:38.400
You mean the interfering idiot
who assaulted me in the street

23:38.400 --> 23:39.760
in front of my friends
and got an award for it?

23:39.760 --> 23:41.840
Yeah, I know him.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.920
We've remained great friends, actually.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.480
Then you might be aware that,
very sadly,

23:45.480 --> 23:47.840
he was recently found dead.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.640
Which might explain these posts
of yours on social media --

23:51.640 --> 23:56.240
"Steve O'Hara -- fat idiot.
Good riddance."

23:56.240 --> 23:58.840
No. No. No. No. No. Hang on.
That was on a private account.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.800
Isn't that a breach
of my privacy or something?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.880
And this one
from a couple weeks ago --

24:02.880 --> 24:06.320
"Watch your back, Stevie boy.
The heat is on."

24:07.280 --> 24:09.080
I wonder, are you familiar

24:09.080 --> 24:12.920
with the 1998
Malicious Communications Act?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.880
- Is that a thing?
- Yes.

24:16.120 --> 24:20.680
Finn, let me ask you
a simple question.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.520
Where were you
the night before last

24:22.520 --> 24:25.040
between 10:00 p.m.
and 4:00 in the morning?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.360
I was at the Chelsea game.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.200
With some friends.
They'll vouch for me.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.600
Afterwards we went to 404.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.760
We were there half the night.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.760
404?

24:35.760 --> 24:38.040
Off Sloane Square. The 404 Club.
You must know it.

24:39.440 --> 24:40.920
And did you leave at any point?

24:40.920 --> 24:42.480
No.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.240
I mean, I popped out for a smoke
a couple of times.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.880
So you did leave?

24:45.880 --> 24:48.040
No. Well
Well, yes.

24:48.040 --> 24:49.480
How long for?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.960
Half an hour?
10 minutes?

24:51.960 --> 24:53.960
Well, which was it?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.760
Because half an hour
would be long enough

24:55.760 --> 24:59.200
to get from Sloane Square to
the murder scene and back again.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.080
Yes, but...

25:01.080 --> 25:03.960
We'll be checking CCTV
in that area.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.000
Will we find you
near the crime scene?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.400
Look.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.960
I can see where you're going
with this.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.200
But you can't possibly think

25:11.200 --> 25:12.760
that I would have killed
this man.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.680
I mean, seriously?

25:22.400 --> 25:25.200
Right. Let's check out this club
he's talking about.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.960
What was it?
The, um...404.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.200
You've never been to the 404,
Max?

25:30.200 --> 25:32.000
Yeah, 404.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.760
It's great Friday nights. Wicked.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.160
Yeah, very funny.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.080
Look, I want his alibi confirmed.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.600
And keep looking at
the social media posts

25:41.600 --> 25:43.640
and all of the others involved.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.760
It's really important
that we don't --

25:45.760 --> 25:47.280
Gov, you're wanted
in the interview room.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.440
Look.
I want to say something,

26:05.440 --> 26:07.880
because when you look
at the CCTV footage,

26:07.880 --> 26:09.880
you'll see that, um...

26:09.880 --> 26:13.000
well, I did pop out for a bit.
About 2:30.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.080
Went to my girlfriend's flat
to see if she wanted to join us.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.440
At 2:30 in the morning?

26:18.440 --> 26:21.480
Yeah, I know.
Stupid thing to do.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.160
I mean, I'm only saying this
because I believe

26:23.160 --> 26:26.480
in being honest
when talking to the police.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
Anyway, the next day,
she dumped me.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
By text.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.200
So this has got nothing at all
to do with Steve O'Hara.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.720
Who, by the way, broke my nose.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.440
I mean, the guy was a maniac.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.520
Sorry. These texts
are on your phone?

26:44.040 --> 26:46.400
Well...

26:46.400 --> 26:50.920
So if you leave it with us,
our technical team

26:50.920 --> 26:53.400
can collaborate that.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.960
You'd get it back.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.720
In a day or two.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.800
Thank you.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.280
Thanks.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.200
Well, you've got to love 'em,

27:13.200 --> 27:16.520
the entitled, overprivileged
offspring of the Chelsea elite.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.200
Is that a point
in the investigation

27:18.200 --> 27:19.880
or a Max Arnold prejudice?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.800
Bit of both.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.720
Right, where are we at?

27:23.720 --> 27:25.200
Okay. As we know,

27:25.200 --> 27:27.280
the "Local Hero" scheme
was started

27:27.280 --> 27:29.200
by someone called
Ricky Hopkinson.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.600
Hello again.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.200
Ricky's wife is Diana Hopkinson,

27:33.200 --> 27:35.000
and they live
in Cranfield Gardens.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.280
Oh!

27:36.280 --> 27:38.600
Now, according to Artie,

27:38.600 --> 27:41.720
Steve also had a day job
working at The Chelsea Nursery.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.120
Which is owned by Diana.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.640
Interesting.
Mm.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.760
Also, boss,
the CCTV footage from Cooper's.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.840
Switched off at 3:00 a.m.
on the night of the murder.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.480
Working as normal...
and then nothing.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.000
So Steve turned it off
before he went home to Siobhan?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.360
Looks like it.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.240
There's also the £500 in cash

28:02.240 --> 28:04.000
we found in his drawer
at Cooper's.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.480
Right.
Talk to Artie again, Connor.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.480
I think there's something
he's not telling us.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.040
Sure.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.440
Ricky Hopkinson. Hm.

28:13.440 --> 28:18.080
He's what we used to call a
well-known local businessman.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.600
Oh.
Another Max Arnold prejudice.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.480
We checked the CCTV,
Mr. Sylvester.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.200
It was fine until 3:00 a.m.,

28:34.200 --> 28:37.400
- then suddenly went blank.
- Right.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.200
Almost as if it was
deliberately switched off.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.400
Any idea
why that might be the case?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.840
Typical of Steve.
How do you mean?

28:43.840 --> 28:46.600
He probably thought
that if the CCTV was off,

28:46.600 --> 28:48.120
he was safe to pop home.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.120
- Had he done that before?
- I never checked.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.120
Right. So how did you
know to switch it on again?

28:54.120 --> 28:57.200
You're on camera at 7:58
in Steve's portacabin.

28:57.200 --> 29:01.040
We also found an envelope
containing £500 in cash.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.600
Why might Steve have had that?

29:03.920 --> 29:05.760
No idea. Listen.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.720
Steve might not have been
the sharpest knife in the box.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.160
But he was a lovely man.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.240
Maybe I covered for him
a few times

29:13.240 --> 29:14.760
when he went to see Siobhan.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.120
Is that such a bad thing?

29:27.160 --> 29:29.040
Oh, look at this one.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.280
Now, there's
no obligation to pay,

29:48.280 --> 29:50.400
but if you'd like
to make a donation...

29:50.400 --> 29:52.000
Oh, thank you. It's
for the Chelsea pensioners.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.600
Well worth doing.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.680
- Mrs. Hopkinson?
- Yes.

29:55.680 --> 30:00.400
I'm D.I. Arnold. This is
D.S. Shamsie. From Chelsea CID.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.480
We'd like a word with you
and your husband,

30:02.480 --> 30:04.040
if it's not inconvenient.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.120
Yes.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.000
If you must.
It's nothing serious, I hope?

30:11.680 --> 30:13.080
One second.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
Scarlett, could you take that
and go out to the front?

30:17.400 --> 30:19.480
Only let them in if they're
genuinely interested in gardens.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.680
Yes, of course. Right.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.800
Uh, excuse me.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.040
Yes, this way.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.520
Ricky, may I grab you
for a moment?

30:33.520 --> 30:36.400
There are a couple
of detectives here.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.040
Right.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.720
We're investigating
the death of a local man

30:49.720 --> 30:52.000
last night
we believe you may know --

30:52.000 --> 30:53.080
Steve O'Hara.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.280
When you say investigating
his death, do you mean he...?

30:58.280 --> 31:01.200
Died in suspicious
circumstances, yes.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.120
Oh, how shocking.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.080
Steve was the man who caught
those teenagers with the drugs.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.240
You know,
the "Local Hero" thing.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.400
Can you confirm
he worked for you?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.880
- No, I hardly knew him.
- Yes, he did.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.680
Ricky, don't you remember?
We gave him some work

31:15.680 --> 31:16.960
at the nursery.
You felt sorry for him.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.680
Oh.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.800
Do you know why anyone
would've wanted to harm Steve?

31:21.960 --> 31:25.520
Not a clue. We were working here
till God knows how late,

31:25.520 --> 31:27.200
getting ready for this Open Day.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.240
They're not asking us
for an alibi, darling.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.400
We're not suspects.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.000
How late?

31:32.000 --> 31:33.520
Well, all night, Detective.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.920
We never left home.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.520
We'll need to speak
to Steve's colleagues

31:38.520 --> 31:40.120
at The Chelsea Nursery.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.480
Of course.
It was very casual work.

31:42.480 --> 31:44.200
Pushing wheelbarrows,
that sort of thing.

31:44.200 --> 31:48.520
Gosh, awful thing.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.080
Excuse me.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.240
Yeah.
It's coming back to me now.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.840
Steve O'Hara.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.120
That's what I started
"Local Hero" for, really.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.880
I mean, we know you lot
don't have the resources

32:23.880 --> 32:25.880
to keep on top of everything.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.840
We're very grateful.

32:27.840 --> 32:32.640
Oh, what's your line of business
these days, Mr. Hopkinson?

32:32.640 --> 32:35.600
Ricky, please.
Import/export.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.960
Strategic investments.
Mixture of things, really.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.440
You've obviously done well.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.920
Don't worry, Detective.
It's all completely aboveboard.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.520
I wasn't implying otherwise.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.040
You didn't have to.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.040
Nice to meet you.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.960
Max Arnold!

32:59.960 --> 33:01.720
Don't walk away
from your beloved aunt.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.480
What are you doing here?

33:05.080 --> 33:06.800
You know my interest
in horticulture.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.600
Hmm. Zero.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.880
How are you, Olivia?

33:09.880 --> 33:12.000
Kind of you to ask.
He never does.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.440
I wouldn't have thought that
this was your cup of tea either.

33:14.440 --> 33:19.000
Oh, it isn't. Ghastly people
making use of the Open Day

33:19.000 --> 33:21.960
to advertise
their overpriced garden center.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.000
For some reason, I volunteered
to take photos

33:26.000 --> 33:29.240
for the best-tended
herbaceous border prize.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.400
Very public-spirited of you.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.920
Come to think of it,
they haven't got enough judges.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.680
Oh, well. Priya...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.520
Oh, come on, Max.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.040
Isn't it time you did something
for the community?

33:41.360 --> 33:44.040
Send me the pictures.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.880
By the way, Max,
how's that boat of yours?

33:47.880 --> 33:51.240
Still above water?
I should pop 'round.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.000
Maybe tomorrow night?
I'm free.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.480
That would be rather nice.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.360
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.680
Whatever it is you're thinking.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.320
I'm just thinking what
a charming lady your aunt is.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.440
Thank you.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.000
What was all that about?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.640
Who knows?

34:19.640 --> 34:22.880
That's what comes of giving jobs
to people like him.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.520
Not for the first time, eh?

34:31.680 --> 34:33.600
I didn't get much more
from Artie.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.400
He claims to know nothing
about the cash

34:35.400 --> 34:38.920
and puts the CCTV down to Steve
leaving to visit Siobhan.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.160
Does anyone believe a word
Artie Sylvester says?

34:42.160 --> 34:45.960
Separate issue. Connor's also
found some interesting footage

34:45.960 --> 34:49.040
- near the O'Haras' flat.
- The coverage isn't great.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.560
That's Steve O'Hara.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.600
And this is the other guy.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.720
They're not chatting
about the Chelsea match.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.720
Good work, Connor.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.760
Well, we all know who that is,
don't we?

35:05.760 --> 35:07.360
I think we do.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.720
Strange job, palliative care.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.160
And them long-term clients.

35:25.160 --> 35:28.200
Dad and his carer got
quite close the last few months.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.640
I thought
they might get married.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.960
Yeah, I remember.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.640
You were worried she was
gonna get the bookshop.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.960
She'd have been responsible
for the debts.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.240
- Shall we?
- Mm.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.480
- She's asleep.
- That's fine.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.680
It's you we want to talk to.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.200
I can't be long.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.960
We have some footage
we would like you to look at.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.640
The image is quite small,

35:59.640 --> 36:01.320
but you can see the date
in the corner.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.400
It's the day before the murder.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.760
What were you arguing about
with Steve, Paulo?

36:09.760 --> 36:12.640
Listen. This was a brutal attack
which left a man dead

36:12.640 --> 36:15.560
and deprived the woman you're
caring for of her husband.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.520
Okay. Look, I didn't approve
of what he was doing.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.960
- Which was?
- He was buying drugs illegally

36:19.960 --> 36:21.840
to supplement the pain relief.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.480
But I didn't feel
I could interfere.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.960
What kind of drugs?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.120
Heroin.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.880
Where were you
the night before last?

36:34.880 --> 36:36.920
I was at home.
With my partner.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.120
- You can check it out.
- We will.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Siobhan.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.040
It's the detectives, love.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.600
We understand that Steve would
sometimes come home

37:02.600 --> 37:06.120
from Cooper's in the middle
of the night to check on you.

37:06.120 --> 37:08.280
Were you expecting him
to do that

37:08.280 --> 37:09.720
the night he was attacked?

37:09.720 --> 37:11.520
He never did that.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.560
- Right.
- He would never have done that.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.640
So you don't think
he would have left the premises

37:18.640 --> 37:19.520
to meet somebody?

37:20.640 --> 37:22.680
What are you suggesting?

37:23.520 --> 37:26.600
That Steve was doing
something wrong?

37:26.600 --> 37:28.840
How can you say that?

37:28.840 --> 37:30.840
We're not suggesting that.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.120
We're trying to establish
why he left his place of work.

37:35.120 --> 37:39.480
Maybe he saw someone
selling drugs and chased them,

37:39.480 --> 37:41.520
like the time before.

37:41.520 --> 37:45.720
It's not <i>my</i> job
to work out what happened.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.120
It's <i>yours.</i>

37:48.120 --> 37:51.520
And it won't bring him back anyway.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.440
You all right?

38:09.440 --> 38:12.520
Had a date tonight,
if you must know.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.440
I'm sure he'll understand.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.720
Who's to say it's a he?

38:20.400 --> 38:22.480
- Oh, this is interesting.
- Hold on a minute.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.440
Oh.
- You go first.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.960
When you found that footage of
the carer arguing with Steve,

38:26.960 --> 38:28.880
did you go any further back?

38:28.880 --> 38:30.600
Yeah, a couple of days.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.520
Take a look at this.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.960
Last Monday.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.320
That's our friend Paulo again,
isn't it?

38:39.960 --> 38:41.480
What the hell's he up to here?

38:43.680 --> 38:45.400
What did you have?

38:45.400 --> 38:47.120
So...

38:47.120 --> 38:49.920
here's a list of all
the registered U.K. nurses.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.200
Guess who isn't on it.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.920
Paulo Mendez.
Mm-hmm.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.360
Oh.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.640
It was a bloke,
as a matter of fact.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.680
- What?
- My date.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.200
Quite a promising one, actually.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.000
Well...he's a lucky lad.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.680
Thanks, Dad.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.800
Hello?

40:35.360 --> 40:36.600
Yeah.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.600
The man who attacked
Artie Sylvester last night

41:03.600 --> 41:05.920
is the same man I saw
at the scene of the crime,

41:05.920 --> 41:09.680
where I managed to take
a not-very-helpful photo of him.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.440
Steve and Artie were attacked
in the same vicinity.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.120
So we need to find this man.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.080
Connor, see if Artie's
well enough

41:17.080 --> 41:19.600
for you and Priya
to pay him a visit.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.120
Okay, people of interest.
Where are we on Finn Davidson?

41:22.120 --> 41:23.280
His alibi checks out.
He said

41:23.280 --> 41:24.880
he went 'round
his girlfriend's flat,

41:24.880 --> 41:26.280
but she sent him packing.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.640
She's corroborated this,

41:27.640 --> 41:29.560
and his phone movements
back it up.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.720
Hard to see how he could have
been anywhere near

41:30.720 --> 41:32.360
- the scene of crime.
- Okay.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.400
Thank you.
Turns out Artie Sylvester

41:34.400 --> 41:36.680
discharged himself already.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.400
Great. He's clearly well enough
to talk to us.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.440
Jess, you and I need to talk
to Paulo Mendez.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.680
- Is he here?
- Uniform are bringing him in.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.000
Okay, find out
who he was talking to

41:45.000 --> 41:46.200
on that footage from last night.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.400
Mm-hmm.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.000
Wicked.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.720
There's no hurry, Paulo.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.080
We've got all day.

42:00.080 --> 42:03.640
You told us
Steve was buying drugs

42:03.640 --> 42:05.960
to supplement
Siobhan's medication.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.880
Well, he's dead,
so he can't argue with that.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.400
But these pictures
tell a different story.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.400
Listen.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.520
What you've got to realize is,
cancer is hard.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.240
You know what they say
about people

42:18.240 --> 42:20.400
dying peacefully in their sleep?

42:20.400 --> 42:23.960
Well, sometimes they do,
and sometimes they don't.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.440
I hated seeing her suffer.

42:26.440 --> 42:28.720
I'm sure you did.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.560
So tell us what you were up to.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.400
How's the arm, Artie?

42:43.400 --> 42:45.240
It's okay.
Don't want to make any fuss.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.080
You were the victim
of an assault.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.480
We'll be looking for
the person that did that.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.920
I wouldn't want
to press charges.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.440
- Why?
- Who attacked you, Artie?

42:54.440 --> 42:56.400
- Do you know?
- I know exactly who it was.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.480
Steve's friend Taffy.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.440
Steve was furious.

43:02.440 --> 43:04.480
But Siobhan asked me to do it.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.840
She gave me the name
of this dealer.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.240
So you lied to us.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.040
I didn't want to get
anyone in trouble.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.960
You mean yourself?

43:11.960 --> 43:15.160
Is that because you're
not registered, Paulo?

43:15.160 --> 43:17.200
We've searched everywhere,
and we can't find you.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.880
I'm a qualified nurse in Brazil.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.200
I'm just waiting for my
U.K. license to come through.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.720
Then you're breaking the law.
I'm supplying a need.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.440
People don't want to look after
the terminally ill patients.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.040
It's hard, it's upsetting.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.280
I'm doing my best.

43:39.680 --> 43:42.480
So let me get this straight.
This Taffy

43:42.480 --> 43:45.080
badgers you for a job,
and you refused.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.200
Because he's a drunk.
I hardly know him.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.400
I don't even know
his second name.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.960
I don't believe you.
- I don't.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.200
How about this for a theory,
Artie?

43:52.200 --> 43:53.960
You, Steve, Taffy,

43:53.960 --> 43:55.440
you're all involved
in selling drugs.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.720
Steve gets killed,
and Taffy blames you.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.640
It was nothing to do with drugs.

43:59.640 --> 44:00.880
A man is dead.

44:00.880 --> 44:02.480
You keep lying to us.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.240
Clearly you're up to something.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.280
What is it?
All right.

44:07.680 --> 44:11.240
Steve and me were selling a bit
of excess stock for cash.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.840
Taffy got to hear about it somehow,

44:12.840 --> 44:15.960
probably thought that
he could use it to twist my arm.

44:15.960 --> 44:18.360
There's nothing more to it
than that.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.200
Does Siobhan know about it?

44:20.200 --> 44:22.240
Of course not.
She wouldn't approve.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.760
We need to talk
to Taffy, Artie.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.480
Where will we find him?
I don't know.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.440
- Artie!
- He did some work

44:28.440 --> 44:31.520
at that posh garden center
with Steve.

44:31.520 --> 44:33.120
They might be able to help.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.040
You were practicing in the U.K.
without a license.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.200
You were buying drugs illegally

44:41.200 --> 44:43.880
and administering them
to a dying woman.

44:43.880 --> 44:46.880
Her husband, quite reasonably,
confronted you about that,

44:46.880 --> 44:49.200
and then he gets killed.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.040
Look.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.360
I was at home with my partner.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.680
You talk to him.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.680
We have.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.680
What's this dealer called,
Paulo?

45:18.520 --> 45:20.440
"Marac Ata."

45:21.760 --> 45:23.600
I should get back
to Siobhan now.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.280
I don't think so, Paulo.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.000
If that's your idea of care,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.320
nursing's better off
without you.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.600
What...

45:38.600 --> 45:40.720
No, that's great.
Got it.

45:40.720 --> 45:43.680
No, stay where you are.
I'll come to you.

45:43.680 --> 45:47.200
Jess, can you follow up
on Marac Ata?

45:47.200 --> 45:49.680
- Maybe talk to the drugs team.
- Will do.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.960
Meanwhile, we've got a name for
our man at the crime scene --

45:52.960 --> 45:54.480
Taffy.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.400
- Just Taffy?
- Afraid so.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.000
Okay.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.280
Max, this has just come in.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.480
We've been looking into
Paulo Mendez's bank records.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.480
He's been paid regularly
by CHAPS payment.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.720
Nothing odd about that,
but look at this --

46:10.720 --> 46:12.240
where the money came from.

46:14.280 --> 46:16.280
Well, well, well.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.840
Huh.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.800
I think I might go
and buy some plants.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.000
Come on!

46:40.760 --> 46:42.840
Oh, God, this traffic.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.800
Could turn on the blues.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.600
You know the rules, Max.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.040
Go on!
You can do that!

47:06.520 --> 47:09.400
Go on, do it.

47:09.400 --> 47:12.880
It's a good job
you don't do the driving.

47:12.880 --> 47:15.880
I'm actually very good.

47:15.880 --> 47:19.000
I just prefer two wheels
to four.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.000
So you think
Artie's building scam

47:22.000 --> 47:24.200
is unconnected to this murder?

47:24.200 --> 47:27.880
Yeah. I mean, he gave us
some names to check out.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.800
But I'd be surprised.

47:31.720 --> 47:32.840
Oh.
Oh, thank God!

48:04.800 --> 48:06.880
Diana Hopkinson?

48:38.920 --> 48:41.600
I wasn't expecting to see you again.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.440
Your colleagues
were here yesterday.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.120
Well, they tell us
nobody was able to help.

48:46.120 --> 48:48.960
The truth is, most people
hardly knew Steve.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.960
The horticulturalists tend not
to mix much

48:50.960 --> 48:53.000
with the more casual staff,
I'm afraid.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.880
But, uh,
oh, it really is so sad.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.200
We're very cut up about it.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.160
We'd like to speak to
someone who works here,

49:00.160 --> 49:02.880
but we only have a first name --
Taffy.

49:02.880 --> 49:04.520
Yes, Taffy.

49:04.520 --> 49:07.520
Yeah, he did help out
from time to time.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.000
We've had to let him go.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.240
He, uh...wasn't reliable.

49:11.240 --> 49:13.840
Do you have a home address?
Phone number?

49:13.840 --> 49:18.040
We should have some basic
information, yeah. This way.

49:30.400 --> 49:33.040
Yes, there we are.
Taffy Clarke.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.720
Do you mind if I, um...

49:37.720 --> 49:39.040
No, go ahead.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.400
I remember
when The Chelsea Nursery

49:46.400 --> 49:49.160
was a flower stall
off the Kings Road.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.720
You've come a long way,
Mrs. Hopkinson.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.000
Yes. Well, uh, it's...
Sorry.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.800
It's been
a lot of hard work.

49:58.400 --> 50:01.240
There was one other person
I wanted to ask about --

50:01.240 --> 50:02.760
Siobhan.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.200
O'Hara.

50:05.200 --> 50:06.480
Steve's widow.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.720
Oh, yes, yes.
Poor woman.

50:09.720 --> 50:13.080
You said you first met Steve
a few months ago.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.920
That's right.
Ricky felt he was somebody

50:14.920 --> 50:16.520
who could do with a leg up.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.680
That's very Ricky.

50:19.600 --> 50:22.560
That would account for
Siobhan's palliative care nurse?

50:23.760 --> 50:25.400
Sorry?

50:26.360 --> 50:29.920
Do you know him,
Mrs. Hopkinson?

50:29.920 --> 50:32.400
Paulo Mendez?

50:32.400 --> 50:33.560
Why would I?

50:35.400 --> 50:38.000
He's been on your payroll
for the last six months.

50:41.480 --> 50:46.200
Look, I can see
that might seem surprising.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.960
It's a gesture.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.680
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

50:49.680 --> 50:52.240
How much is your husband
involved in the business,

50:52.240 --> 50:54.200
Mrs. Hopkinson?
Hardly at all.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.240
This is <i>my</i> territory.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.280
Honestly, anyone would think
you suspected me of attacking

51:01.280 --> 51:02.920
Steve O'Hara myself.

51:07.720 --> 51:11.360
I'm showing Mr. Ata CCTV footage
of an exchange that took place

51:11.360 --> 51:14.960
on the 23rd May between him
and Paulo Mendez.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.440
Mr. Ata, you understand English?

51:17.480 --> 51:20.360
A little.
Of course you do.

51:20.360 --> 51:21.960
Not your first time here,
is it?

51:33.640 --> 51:36.400
We've interviewed Paulo Mendez,
and he gave us your name

51:36.400 --> 51:37.720
as the man
he's buying drugs from here.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.040
A heroin-based substance.

51:40.960 --> 51:42.960
Show me again.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.240
Could be anybody.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.240
- We believe it's you.
- If it wasn't you,

51:53.240 --> 51:55.000
why did Paulo Mendez
give us your name?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.960
I don't know the guy.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.760
Is he someone you can trust?

52:02.480 --> 52:05.880
Does the name Steve O'Hara
mean anything to you, Mr. Ata?

52:05.880 --> 52:08.520
- No.
- Steve O'Hara

52:08.520 --> 52:11.200
was found murdered
two nights ago.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.920
He was the husband
of Siobhan O'Hara,

52:13.920 --> 52:16.080
whose nurse, Paulo Mendez,

52:16.080 --> 52:17.880
we believe, you were
selling drugs to.

52:17.880 --> 52:20.400
We're interested to know
whether you ever met Mr. O'Hara,

52:20.400 --> 52:22.120
and we'd like to know
where you were

52:22.120 --> 52:24.480
- on Saturday night.
- Why?

52:24.480 --> 52:26.280
Because it's part
of our investigation.

52:26.280 --> 52:28.200
So you thought,

52:28.200 --> 52:29.720
"Let's round up
the foreign guy"?

52:31.960 --> 52:34.200
I was at home.
Like every night.

52:34.200 --> 52:35.960
Can anyone corroborate that?

52:35.960 --> 52:37.200
I live alone.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.600
What about your phone records?

52:40.880 --> 52:42.920
I don't stay up all night
making calls.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.040
Here, take my phone.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.200
Help yourselves.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.640
See if you can find
any connection

52:53.640 --> 52:57.840
to this Paulo Mendez
or Steve O'Hara.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.120
Thanks.

53:03.600 --> 53:07.480
Well...we've got the phone
he gave us, but not much more.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.400
- Tech are gonna scan it.
- He's probably got

53:09.400 --> 53:10.840
a cupboard full of 'em.
We've found out

53:10.840 --> 53:12.480
Taffy's last name -- Clarke.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.960
But that's about it.

53:13.960 --> 53:15.520
He's not answering his mobile,

53:15.520 --> 53:17.920
and he's not at the address
they gave us.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.960
Did you follow up on the leads
from Artie Sylvester?

53:19.960 --> 53:22.720
Yeah, I did. We've got
a few loose ends to tie up,

53:22.720 --> 53:24.480
but I don't think there's
any connection with the murder.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.000
Okay.
And the Hopkinsons?

53:26.000 --> 53:27.440
We're waiting to hear
more from fraud.

53:27.440 --> 53:29.760
There's a web
of interlinked companies

53:29.760 --> 53:31.680
which they've been trying
to disentangle for a while.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.200
Right.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.400
Well, we're two nil down
at halftime.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.280
Mm.
- Come on.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.240
We need to score some goals.

53:39.240 --> 53:41.000
Yes, boss.

54:32.280 --> 54:33.520
Hmm.

54:46.640 --> 54:50.040
Ah, perfect timing.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.920
Well, this is a privilege.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.680
The beast in his lair.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.000
- Mwah.
- Mwah. Mwah.

55:00.280 --> 55:04.760
Please.
Glass of wine?

55:04.760 --> 55:06.640
- Some crisps?
- Oh.

55:06.640 --> 55:09.760
You've made an effort.
I am touched.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.440
Well...

55:12.440 --> 55:15.240
this is...cozy.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.440
I won't fill it too full.

55:19.440 --> 55:21.040
Tide's coming in.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.480
Mm...

55:31.960 --> 55:35.200
Olivia, you remember
those photos you sent me

55:35.200 --> 55:37.440
from the Open Gardens Day?

55:38.840 --> 55:41.880
You don't have any more
from a similar angle, do you?

55:41.880 --> 55:43.680
Of course, darling.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.600
I've got loads.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.320
There you go.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.200
Olivia, these are good.

55:58.600 --> 56:01.360
Ah, just what I was looking for.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.520
Does this mean I'm helping
the police with their inquiries?

56:04.520 --> 56:08.600
It does. I don't think an arrest
will be necessary.

56:08.600 --> 56:15.280
Oh, I also brought this.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.040
I didn't know
you were selling up.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.480
<i>I'm</i> not.

56:23.480 --> 56:25.480
Well, perhaps
it's a similar flat.

56:25.480 --> 56:27.120
I mean, they're all
much of a muchness

56:27.120 --> 56:28.560
in those mansion blocks,
aren't they?

56:31.200 --> 56:35.440
Max. One thing you learn
as you get older

56:35.440 --> 56:39.200
is, it's better to be together,
not on your own.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.480
Jane and I drove
each other mad.

56:41.480 --> 56:45.240
But when she'd gone,
I just missed her.

56:45.240 --> 56:49.560
You and Astrid, you were right
for each other.

56:49.560 --> 56:51.720
We were.

56:53.760 --> 56:55.720
But it turns out
we're not anymore.

56:58.200 --> 56:59.920
Shit happens.

57:40.640 --> 57:42.280
Aw!

58:07.400 --> 58:08.640
What are you doing?

58:09.480 --> 58:11.800
Clearing up your mess, Ricky.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.600
As usual.

59:40.200 --> 59:41.440
Bingo.

59:46.880 --> 59:48.520
Let it go.
Let it go.

59:48.520 --> 59:49.920
Good. Control. Control.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.720
Nice. That's good.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.880
Max Arnold.
I don't see you in months.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.920
Now it's twice in three days.
What brings you down here?

59:59.920 --> 1:00:01.560
Are you in charge?

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:03.360
Yeah.

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:05.600
It's not exactly Real Madrid
money-wise.

1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:08.480
But, trust me,
these players are great.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:11.400
That's it. Hold it up.
Head up. Lay it off.

1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:15.080
Didn't you put much away
during the glory days?

1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:17.360
You're kidding.

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:19.200
What was it George Best said?

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:22.960
"I spent most of my money on
booze, birds, and fast cars."

1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:24.560
"And the rest
I just squandered."

1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:26.080
Yeah.

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:28.960
Heads up.

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:31.520
Can I ask you about tattoos?

1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:34.240
A midlife crisis, eh, Max?

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:38.760
Well, I'd recommend going for
a dragon as your first option.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:42.840
Not for me. I was thinking
more Chelsea tattoos.

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:44.200
Well, there are loads.

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:45.920
Shields. Lions.

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:47.720
If you had a tattoo like that,

1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:50.240
am I right in thinking
it meant something else?

1:00:51.080 --> 1:00:52.960
That, my son, indicated
you were a member

1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:54.280
of the Chelsea Headhunters.

1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:56.960
An association of violent thugs.

1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:59.160
- Racists, too.
- Go on.

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:03.000
Well, you remember. There
weren't that many black players

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.200
in those days. That's why
we got it particularly bad.

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:12.200
What's going on?

1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:15.040
It's just something
I'm following up.

1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.600
I mean, they said
they were Chelsea fans,

1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:21.080
but were they really?

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:22.440
I mean,
football was a sideline,

1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.240
like it was for all
the other firms back then.

1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:29.880
The funny thing is, some of 'em
had respectable jobs.

1:01:29.880 --> 1:01:33.360
You know, they'd sell you
a used car on a Friday,

1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:35.040
kick your head in on a Saturday.

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:39.400
- Oh.
- Okay, ladies.

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:42.840
That's your lot!

1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:44.000
Same time next week.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.680
All the bibs in the bag.

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:47.600
Everyone's silent for a change.

1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:49.920
Here we go. We've got this.
We've got this.

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:51.600
Come on.

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:54.040
Oh, nice. You've
got it. The feet, the feet.

1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:55.840
Oh! Ohh!

1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:59.360
Yes, Max. Oh, yes.

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:00.760
Lovely control.

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.200
So, Steve O'Hara.

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:06.680
Ricky Hopkinson.
Taffy Clarke.

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:09.680
Not only are they all linked
to The Chelsea Nursery --

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:14.240
They all share a tattoo.
And this tattoo...

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:16.960
is evidence that they were all
in the Chelsea Headhunters.

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:20.080
Any more information on Taffy?

1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:22.520
We're doing all we can, boss,
but Taffy's a nickname,

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:26.840
and Clarke is the 13th
most common surname in London.

1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.400
Hmm.
This business

1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:30.840
with the tattoos, boss.
Where did that come from?

1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:33.400
Well, it might surprise you
to know -- I, uh,

1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:36.120
spoke to Carsten Hughes.

1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:38.240
Carsten Hughes?
You're kidding!

1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:40.440
He was my idol when I was a kid.

1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:43.840
Well, it just so happens
he's a friend of mine.

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:46.200
- Hoo-hoo!
- Respect.

1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:49.120
Okay. Let's look
into Headhunters

1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:51.280
and any links to football. Okay.

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:53.680
I'm a man of surprises, Connor.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:56.600
You probably think
that if you asked me to name

1:02:56.600 --> 1:02:58.640
Chelsea's '97 Cup-winning side

1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:00.600
against Middlesbrough,
I'd struggle.

1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:03.600
Go on.

1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:06.080
Hughes, Zola, Petrescu,

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:08.920
Lebouef, Clarke, Dennis Wise...

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:11.800
- Mm.
- Newton, Minto...

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:15.640
Oh. Oh.

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:17.800
Oh?
Oh, he's struggling.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:19.400
Di Matteo.

1:03:19.480 --> 1:03:21.520
Di Matteo.

1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:22.920
Sinclair.

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.600
Sinclair.

1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:27.000
Right!
But who was in goal?

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.040
- Hmm?
- Who was in goal?

1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:32.200
Who was in goal?

1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:42.280
Watch your step.

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:52.360
I'll just be over here.
All right?

1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:55.040
Yeah. I'll be fine. Thanks.

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:57.760
Sorry to intrude.
We won't be long.

1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.040
Have you caught them?

1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:02.960
We're pursuing various leads.

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:05.880
Somebody killed Steve.
My husband.

1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:07.640
Have you caught them?

1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:10.200
Are you being looked after,
Siobhan?

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:12.040
Do you have friends around
to support you?

1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:14.840
Why do I want friends?

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.080
Steve was my friend.

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:20.200
Siobhan, were you aware,
when Steve was younger,

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:21.600
he was a member of a group

1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:25.040
that called themselves
the Chelsea Headhunters?

1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:27.920
Steve was a lovely guy.

1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:29.920
You're supposed
to catch his killer.

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.480
Does the name Taffy Clarke
mean anything to you?

1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.640
We're keen to talk to you about
Steve's job at Chelsea Nursery.

1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:52.240
Did you know about
the financial arrangements

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:54.680
that were in place for you?
He isn't called Taffy.

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:58.200
His name is Brennon.
Brennon Clarke.

1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:00.760
I'm going home.
I'm ill.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:16.440
We're trying solve her husband's
murder, for God's sake.

1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:21.880
It's hard to put pressure
on someone in that position.

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:23.880
She just lost her husband.

1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:25.760
She's probably only got
a few weeks to live.

1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:27.480
You don't think she's using
her illness

1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:29.320
to dodge our lines of inquiry?

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.400
Come on, Max.

1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:34.360
Thought <i>I</i> was
the hard-hearted one.

1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:38.000
A man makes an arrangement
to buy some heroin

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.000
in the middle of the night.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.360
Argument ensues.

1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:42.360
Man gets stabbed and dies.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:45.080
It's probably the person
selling him the drugs.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:46.760
We can't place anyone
at the scene of the crime,

1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:48.960
so we keep investigating.

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:51.720
That's what we do.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:58.200
Can I ask you something?

1:05:58.200 --> 1:05:59.200
Sure.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.480
Your flat in Streatham.

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:07.200
Do you and Nitin own it jointly?

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:09.280
Yeah.
Any particular reason?

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:13.200
So if you were to split up...

1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:16.520
I mean, if your marriage didn't,

1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:18.720
- you know...
- Right.

1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:22.240
...you'd have to both agree
to sell the flat. Right?

1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:26.240
Yeah, I guess. I mean, I haven't
really thought about it.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:28.680
Exactly.

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:32.080
You don't think about these
things, and then they happen.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:34.800
Murders, you can solve.

1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:38.560
But relationships...

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:40.120
Oh.

1:06:57.480 --> 1:06:59.680
Hasn't changed a bit.

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:01.400
How do you mean?

1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:06.160
Every Saturday, my dad got me
to serve meals here.

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:08.480
Either that, or he wouldn't
let me go to the match.

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:10.200
Sounds reasonable.

1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:12.000
Not to a 14-year-old.

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:42.200
Brennon Clarke?
We'd like a word.

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:43.800
It's okay.

1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:51.440
- How are you?
- Bearing up.

1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:54.200
They give me a bed
here at the hostel.

1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:55.640
It'd be nice to get
me own place, though.

1:07:55.640 --> 1:07:59.000
Why do they call you Taffy
when you're not Welsh?

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.720
Yeah, it's a funny story.

1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:04.960
They started calling me that
after an away match in Cardiff

1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:07.200
where things got a bit lively.

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:09.360
Some bloke ends up in hospital.

1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:13.200
We wanted to talk to you
about Steve O'Hara.

1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:15.960
Ah, yeah, Steve.

1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:17.680
That is so sad.

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:19.400
Had you known Steve a long time?

1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:20.920
We were both Chelsea fans.

1:08:20.920 --> 1:08:22.680
You were both
in the Headhunters.

1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:24.880
Steve?

1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:26.520
I wouldn't have known that.

1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:29.520
I know he got dragged into
some nonsense at work

1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:31.200
by that man Artie Sylvester.

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:32.200
He's a bad lot.

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:33.800
Is that why you attacked Artie?

1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.000
I gave him a shove.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.760
He was hospitalized.

1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:38.360
Habit of yours, Taffy.

1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:39.800
My mate died.

1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:42.880
What can you tell us
about Siobhan O'Hara?

1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:44.520
I knew her slightly.

1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:47.920
Ricky, too, obviously.
Long time ago.

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:51.440
Old friends keeping in touch
from time to time?

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:54.840
Yeah. She tried to contact me
after Steve died.

1:08:54.840 --> 1:08:57.040
Did you speak to her?

1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:00.720
I lost my phone.
I lost my job.

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:04.240
It's been a bad week.

1:09:04.240 --> 1:09:05.960
Where were you that night,
Taffy?

1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:07.520
The night Steve was killed.

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:12.440
Look, this is
a murder investigation.

1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:14.480
- You knew the victim.
- He was my friend.

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:17.600
So you say, but you have
a history of violence.

1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:19.160
Where were you?

1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:22.360
I ended up in a scrap
after the game.

1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:24.080
I spent the night
in Fulham nick.

1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:30.320
So when Steve was murdered,
you were under arrest?

1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:34.800
It's the drink, you see.

1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:40.000
That's why I come in here,
to pray.

1:09:51.480 --> 1:09:52.640
What is the matter?

1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:55.200
Nothing's the matter.

1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.200
Max.
I know you too well.

1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:58.720
You're like a sulky schoolboy.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.440
What is it?

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:03.400
You said you wouldn't
do anything with the flat,

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:06.200
and then you advertise it
in the <i>Chelsea Gazette.</i>

1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:08.840
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Ah.

1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:12.760
Besides, you were supposed
to decide

1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:14.280
between the two estate agents,

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:16.720
and I never heard back from you.

1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:20.440
You were asking me
to choose an estate agent.

1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:22.760
I have a problem
with the underlying concept.

1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:24.960
Max, we have to do something.

1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:27.240
You're still paying
half the mortgage,

1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:29.040
and you have the rent
on the boat.

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:30.600
It can't be easy for you.

1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.000
And I'm struggling, too.

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.200
As you can see, this is one

1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.200
of the best conversions
on this row.

1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.000
Some of the boats
remain unmodernized,

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.600
but things are improving
all the time,

1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:41.280
as more desirable tenants
move in.

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.960
It really is a very unique...

1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:45.240
Remind me what the German
for asshole is.

1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:49.000
- Arschloch.
- Absolutely. It's gorgeous.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:52.080
Max, I found a new flat.

1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:55.520
It's by the football stadium.

1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.680
Might get a bit annoying
on match days.

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:02.360
"Chelsea! Chelsea!"

1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.000
We need a plan.

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.440
We had a plan, Asti.

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:08.920
Remember?

1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:10.800
We exchanged vows on it.

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:12.880
I liked that plan.

1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:15.080
That was plan A, Max.

1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:17.720
And now we need plan B.

1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:23.440
Yeah?

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:25.040
I do like that one. Yeah.

1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:29.400
It's so peaceful.
It's lovely.

1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:30.360
Mm-hmm.

1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:39.200
There's quite a bit of interest,

1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:40.960
so my recommendation
is to move fast.

1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:43.200
There's something very special
about living on the river.

1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:45.560
It really is
the most peaceful spot.

1:13:57.480 --> 1:14:02.400
In April 2000,
Galatasaray and Leeds United

violent semi-final</i>

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:08.000

Leeds?
Not Chelsea?

1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:11.400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:14.640
A few weeks later, the final
took place in Copenhagen.

1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.560
Right.

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:20.600
So, take a look at this picture
from a press report.

1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:38.680
<i>See any familiar faces?</i>

1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:45.240
Got it.

1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:46.600
I'll see you in the morning.

1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:48.040
<i>Okay.</i>

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.880
Sorry, sorry.

1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:05.080
Secret boyfriend.

1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:10.120
Well, there's this guy I've been
spending a lot of time with.

1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:13.200
Ginger.

1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:14.720
Beardy.

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:16.360
Very charismatic.

1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:21.880
You trying to make me jealous?

1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:23.720
Is it working?

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:10.360
Thanks.

1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:12.200
Okay.

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.920
Yeah, okay.

1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:18.240
And Connor's brought him in?

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:19.680
Great.

1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:21.520
Thanks, Jess.
We'll meet you there.

1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:29.720
Can we just get this gentleman
to sign in?

1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:31.560
Of course.
Just sign in here.

1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:38.680
Thank you, Mr. Hopkinson.

1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:40.440
If you'd like to take a seat
over there,

1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:42.920
someone will be with you
in a moment.

1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:44.680
Help yourself to a beverage.

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.680
- Is Connor ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.000
Let's go for it.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.320
Okay.

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:00.520
Hi.

1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:02.040
Yeah.

1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:10.080
Just one to sign out.

1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:13.200
Just there.

1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:14.560
Just sign out on this line here.

1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:30.760
He recognizes him.

1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:32.440
I thought he would.

1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:50.280
So...
Do I need a solicitor?

1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:51.920
It's up to you.

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:54.360
Well, what is it
you want to talk to me about?

1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:56.640
The battle of Copenhagen.

1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:58.320
What?

1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:06.440
You told us you only met
Steve O'Hara a few months back.

1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:09.480
Yet here you are together,
twenty years ago.

1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:11.000
Did that slip your mind?

1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:15.400
Why is it relevant?

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:18.200
Does the name Marac Ata
mean anything to you?

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:19.480
Not a thing.

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.480
Withholding information,
wasting police time --

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:26.200
these are offenses.

1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:29.240
You ought to know that,
with your glittering record.

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:33.200
Grievous bodily harm,
actual bodily harm, assault.

1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:38.400
And in your later business
career, a brief spell inside.

1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:40.200
Don't you remember, Ricky?

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.000
When I was on the fraud squad,

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.640
we spent quite a bit of time
together like this.

1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:46.760
Oh, yeah...

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:50.520
It was a stitch-up,
and you know it.

1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:52.440
You'd think someone with
your background

1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:55.680
would be squeaky clean
these days, Mr. Hopkinson.

1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:57.200
Our friends in Fraud tell us

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:59.720
you've got some
serious questions to answer.

1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:02.080
Is that why I'm here?
No.

1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:05.160
You and Steve were
in the Chelsea Headhunters.

1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:08.000
Then twenty years later,
your wife gives him a job.

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.720
And then he gets killed.

1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.640
You can see why
we might be interested.

1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:14.240
For God's sake, we were kids.

1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:16.240
It was a lark.

1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:18.200
We look out for each other.

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:20.200
I give 'em a bit of work
here and there.

1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:21.640
They haven't all done
as well as me.

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:23.720
You paid for his wife's
nursing care.

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.240
So why would I kill him?

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:30.520
I mean,
Steve basically was a hanger-on.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:32.600
Was he one of the lads?

1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:35.200
Not sure he had the bottle
for it, to be honest.

1:19:35.200 --> 1:19:37.600
I felt sorry for him.

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.880
How he ended up with
Siobhan Taylor, God alone knows.

1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.440
Siobhan Taylor?

1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:58.120
Hold off.

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:04.640
Apologies for the
inconvenience, Mr. Hopkinson.

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.040
We'll just get you signed out.

1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:10.040
Just there.

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:15.600
So, you were a Chelsea fan
back in the '90s?

1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:18.600
I was. Still am.

1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:20.360
Do you remember Carsten Hughes?

1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:23.080
I do. Great player. Yeah.

1:20:23.080 --> 1:20:25.200
Is it true the fans
used to make monkey noises

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:26.720
at the Black players?

1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:32.040
Can I go now?

1:20:57.040 --> 1:20:58.600
I'll get you some water.

1:21:05.080 --> 1:21:09.520
Siobhan, you and Steve,
how did you meet?

1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:14.280
Steve was a Londoner,
but your accent is more...

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.280
...Yorkshire?

1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:20.080
Somewhere near Leeds?

1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:26.720
You remember that match
in Istanbul in 2000?

1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:30.680
UEFA Cup semi-final,
Galatasaray and Leeds United.

1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:33.040
The press reports said
two Leeds fans

1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:35.680
were stabbed to death.

1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:41.440
But there was a third fatality,
which only emerged later --

1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:43.040
Vince Taylor.

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:47.240
He was your brother, wasn't he?

1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:53.600
The English firms,
including Chelsea, agreed

1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:56.120
to sink their differences,
and a few weeks later,

1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:59.760
they went to the final
in Copenhagen to take revenge.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:03.280
Steve. Ricky. Taffy.

1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:05.120
All the Chelsea firm
were there.

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:13.920
That's you, isn't it?

1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:16.000
Siobhan Taylor.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.960
And that's where a fight
broke out

1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:21.040
with a gang of
Galatasaray supporters.

1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:23.360
One of which was this man.

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:29.640
Marac Ata.

1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:32.000
He's walked with a limp
ever since.

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:07.480
Steve didn't
lay a finger on Ata.

1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:10.480
That was Ricky.

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:13.480
But Steve was beaten up
so badly,

1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:17.200
he was in hospital for weeks.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:20.800
That's why we could
never have children.

1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:29.560
So why are you sitting
on Ricky's knee?

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:33.360
I loved him.

1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:35.080
But I couldn't have him.

1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:39.400
So I settled for Steve,
and he made me happy.

1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:42.760
How did you find Marac
after all this time?

1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:50.240
We knew the names of the gang
who killed Vince

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:51.800
and we tracked them.

1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:54.240
And then last Autumn,

1:23:54.240 --> 1:23:58.600
Ata turns up in London,
selling drugs.

1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:01.480
He was the ringleader.

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:07.960
So Steve decided to kill him?

1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:11.560
It was my idea, not Steve's.

1:24:13.480 --> 1:24:16.760
I would have murdered
the bastard myself

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:18.800
if I had the strength.

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:24.240
Vince was my brother.

1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:30.400
When he died,
nothing else mattered.

1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:33.720
Twenty years we waited.

1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:38.720
I planned the whole thing.

1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:49.960
I should've known
Steve would mess it up.

1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:52.640
And Taffy?

1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:54.040
He wouldn't help.

1:24:56.200 --> 1:24:58.600
He let me down.

1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:00.680
Everyone lets me down.

1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:44.800
Yes. Police.

1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:46.920
Siobhan O'Hara.

1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:50.840
I'm arresting you for conspiracy
to murder Marac Ata.

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:54.360
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:56.680
if you do not mention
when questioned

1:25:56.680 --> 1:25:59.240
something which you
later rely on in court.

1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:04.840
Do you honestly think I care?

1:26:13.480 --> 1:26:15.200
Ah.

1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:16.040
Oh!

1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:23.640
Let him go!

1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:25.080
Stay back!

1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:31.760
Look, I don't know
who you are...

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:33.640
He knows who I am.

1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:35.040
He ruined my life!

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:42.720
Help him!

1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:44.040
Let him go!

1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:51.400
You're under arrest.

1:26:53.400 --> 1:26:55.880
You bloody animal!

1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.400
I should've finished you off
the first time!

1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:00.160
- Stand back, Mr. Hopkinson.
- Stand back?!

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:02.000
I'm the innocent victim here!

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.720
Stand back!

1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:15.680
Always the innocent victim,
eh, Mr. Hopkinson?

1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:17.720
Well, we may have
limited resources,

1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:19.680
but we've just saved your life.

1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:21.400
Which is good,

1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:23.080
because our friends
in the fraud squad

1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:25.440
have just issued a warrant
for your arrest.

1:27:40.240 --> 1:27:42.000
It's a tough one.

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.240
Marac will run
a self-defense argument.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:45.680
For Steve, yes.

1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:48.160
But the attempted murder
of Ricky won't help.

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.920
It's not much to choose
between them --

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:52.720
Marac, Ricky, Taffy.

1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:54.480
Once a thug, always a thug.

1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.480
- Connor did well.
- Yeah, he did.

1:27:57.480 --> 1:27:59.440
What do we think about Siobhan?

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:01.560
Weirdly, I feel sorry for her.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:04.680
She told her husband to stab
a man to death in cold blood.

1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:07.640
The fact that he didn't succeed
is neither here nor there.

1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:09.440
It's such a mess.

1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:11.720
And over what? Football?

1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:13.520
It's just a game.

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:20.200
Some people think football
is a matter of life and death.

1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:22.520
And you?

1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:24.360
Much more serious than that.

1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:29.880
- It was Grodas, by the way.
- Sorry?

1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:32.760
The 1997 Chelsea goalie.

1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:35.000
It was.

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:36.560
I'm off.

1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:19.200
Uh...

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:26.560
Hi.

1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:31.640
Ohh!

1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:34.040
- Shh.
- Oh, little baby...

1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:44.440
I agree, Asti.

1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:46.800
I wouldn't want to live near
Stamford Bridge, either.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:49.280
Okay.

1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:50.840
Fine.

1:29:53.760 --> 1:29:55.560
Let's think again.

1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:58.400
Max!
Carsten!

1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:01.200
I was heading home
and I thought,

1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:04.400
why keep a six-pack
all to yourself?

1:30:04.400 --> 1:30:07.640
The joys of bachelor life.

1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:09.240
Let me get rid of this.

1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:22.160
So...
what are we celebrating?

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.760
How about a strong finish
to the season for Chelsea?

1:30:25.760 --> 1:30:27.800
I'll drink to that.
