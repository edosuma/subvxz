00:28.571 --> 00:30.904
that felt like a betrayal.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.656
People like thatshouldn't have.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.159
Who are the s

00:35.202 --> 00:38.162
and why is someone texting you?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.872

- You o

00:39.915 --> 00:40.706

00:40.750 --> 00:42.833
It's a gang symbol, isn't it?

00:42.877 --> 00:44.918
- You have to trust me.
- Get ou.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.628

01:14.700 --> 01:16.450
Go.-What'd he look like?

01:16.494 --> 01:20.079
Fat, skinny? Race?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.789
I had to lie for you, asshole..

01:21.832 --> 01:23.624
You say one wordabout that phoe

01:23.667 --> 01:25.000
and I will kill you myself.

01:25.044 --> 01:28.754
Find my brother, or at least.

01:28.798 --> 01:29.505
What are you gonna do with him?

01:29.548 --> 01:32.007
Make him disappear.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.371
Pete, Karen, I need you to take,

01:34.011 --> 01:35.291
make sure Sleep's body is still.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.212
We got bigger problems than t.

01:41.894 --> 01:42.894
What's going on?

01:49.068 --> 01:51.276
How long have you twobeen work?

01:51.320 --> 01:52.986
How long?

03:41.096 --> 03:43.016
Take your hand off the gun
or he will drop you.

03:52.650 --> 03:53.357
It's not what you think.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.860
Then explain yourself.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.277
She's screwing
this piece of shit!

03:57.321 --> 04:00.072
I knew it!

04:00.115 --> 04:02.741
I was, until I realized
he was screwing us!

04:02.785 --> 04:04.534
And even after you saw he was,

04:04.578 --> 04:07.079
you chose him over us.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.581
- It is not like that.
- It's exactly like that.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.292
This is on me, not her.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.252
Shut up!

04:13.295 --> 04:14.378
Shut up!

04:21.220 --> 04:22.010
You better leave
and forget you saw any of this.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.845
What the hell is going on?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.209
It's none of your damn business.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.098
It's somethingwe're handling in.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.183
We need to talk in private.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.185
Go.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.229
Go!

04:33.023 --> 04:35.732
You better have a goodgoddamn.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.443
You want what happened to Slee?

04:38.487 --> 04:40.612
Let me do what needs to be done.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.489
I know you now, Hammond.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.448
You're not the type to kill som.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.576
Not in cold blood.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.620
We've got other options.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.968
Who'd you tellabout Sleep's ph?

05:03.012 --> 05:04.012
Nobody.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.204
I need him to give mesomething.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.104
Why?-So we can leverage him

05:14.148 --> 05:15.292
into keeping quiet.-We can't tr.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.982
I'm in charge here, not you.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.547
You think you can play with?

05:20.571 --> 05:23.447
Let him go!
-

05:23.490 --> 05:25.574
Come on!-Hey, hey, hey!

05:25.617 --> 05:26.950
He's not gonna say shit!

05:26.994 --> 05:29.494
The Vipers are sitting on gunstm

05:29.538 --> 05:30.996
an armory up north.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.925
And last one.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.178
When does this take effect?-Co.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.501
Depends on how fastthey process.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.015
That soon?

05:51.477 --> 05:52.477
You're welcome.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.023
Just give me a minute.-Sure.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.347
We're wrapped up here, anyway..

06:09.578 --> 06:10.994
You got that look.

06:14.917 --> 06:15.374
Something happenl should know a?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.542
It's nothing.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.336
Don't lie to me, son.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.883
Come on, what is it? Something a?

06:24.927 --> 06:27.094
It's nothing. Steve's got it ha.

06:27.137 --> 06:31.139
Steve's job as leaderis to pre,

06:31.183 --> 06:33.100
not to run around fixing them.

06:33.143 --> 06:37.187
So what was your lawyer doing?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.147
Any new developmentsor anything?

06:39.191 --> 06:40.982
No.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.223
Nah, same shit, different day. H.

07:00.003 --> 07:04.005
It's like watching pai.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.426
This guy selling a kilo or a?

07:07.469 --> 07:10.011
Look, I know you're irritated,.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.555
It doesn't matter now, does it?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.890
Beach made a mistake.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.600
She let the wrong person get.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.060
No, she made a choice.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.164
The second she got her tattoo,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.272
nobody was more important to he.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.232
No doubt.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.545
But keeping secrets frompeople,

07:23.569 --> 07:24.985
that shit ain't easy.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.145
You trying to tell me somethi?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.869
Is that why she kicked you out?

07:33.912 --> 07:34.453
I don't wanna talk about it, a?

07:34.496 --> 07:35.496
Are you serious?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.622
She figured it out.

07:37.666 --> 07:38.999
Your wife figured it out?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.214
Has everybodylost their goddamn?

07:46.258 --> 07:47.258
Shit!

07:49.011 --> 07:50.552
She read texts on my phone, al?

07:50.596 --> 07:52.471
About the Berserkers.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.056
I was afraid that if I wasn'tho.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.101
You're a selfish asshole.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.102
Look, she doesn't know we've b.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.855
She thinkswe're assisting the f.

08:01.899 --> 08:02.689
She's not gonna tell anyone,.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.483
You better hope she doesn't.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.275
What?-It's done.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.985
Piss off!

09:33.365 --> 09:34.906
Here we go.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.575
You think you could find the.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.163
Doesn't look like armory boxes.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.999
No.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.016
Holy shit.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.667
Ooh!

10:27.711 --> 10:29.002
Damn, that's a lot of dope.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.256
Yeah.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.689
So how's this work?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.983
You say anything about Sleep,

10:52.027 --> 10:54.653
we let Winters knowyou gave up.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.613
You happy now? We even?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.031
You did this to yourself.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.075
You should have leftthe goddamn.

11:06.792 --> 11:07.540
If Winters finds out, I'm dead.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.958
Welcome to the club.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.002
We're deadif Neckbone finds out.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.350
We're thinking this is the dopb

11:25.394 --> 11:26.935
before you guys hit it.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.561
So the Viperswere working both,

11:28.605 --> 11:30.897
Neckbone and the WMD.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.108
Nah, not the Vipers. Just Wi.

11:33.151 --> 11:37.070
We came here expectingto find?

11:37.114 --> 11:38.394
And if Foster doesn'tknow about,

11:39.700 --> 11:40.824
it's pretty safe to say that

11:40.867 --> 11:41.366
neither doesthe rest of the gan.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.868
This is good.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.746
Now we can tie Wintersinto the.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.070
You made the right call on this.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.960
It solves the problem temporar.

11:52.003 --> 11:55.046
'Cause if Foster runs his mouth.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.008
So are we straight?

12:00.929 --> 12:01.761
You ever lay your hands on me,

12:01.805 --> 12:03.085
one of us won't be walking away.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.406
Three items?

12:20.449 --> 12:21.990
I've been busy.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.495
It's a start.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.081
Not very specific.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.666
I asked you to write down thel

12:31.710 --> 12:32.917
your mother betrayed you.

12:32.961 --> 12:33.877
You said we were gonnatalk abo.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.212
I didn't knowyou wanted an essa.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.006
Okay.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.178
Let's talk about food.

12:43.221 --> 12:47.140
My mother knew that broccolima.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.100
And yet, there it was, three, fo,

12:49.144 --> 12:53.188
and I wasn't allowed to leave t.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.440
What?

12:55.484 --> 12:58.902
Not dramatic enough for you?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.779
I was hopingwe could go deeper,

13:00.822 --> 13:02.102
"My mothermade me eat broccoli."

13:14.544 --> 13:15.919
She didn't want me.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.006
She told me as much.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.093
Liked to pretend that I wasn't.

13:32.354 --> 13:35.021
Once, when I was eight or nine,

13:35.065 --> 13:36.981
I heard these screamscoming fro.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.986
So I picked up a bat, went in.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.072
Saw this guy on top of her, I th.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.441
So I started whaling on this go.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.998
Got a couple good shotsin there.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.461
He went running.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.008
My mother didn't feed me for th.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.518
Traumatic enough?

14:14.479 --> 14:15.479
Getting there.

14:23.572 --> 14:24.988
So how does this end?

14:27.659 --> 14:28.950
You want me to go talk to herale

14:28.994 --> 14:31.578
and say that it's okaythat she t

14:31.621 --> 14:32.996
because she has issues?

14:34.583 --> 14:35.999
Well, not quite that.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.050
We can tie Winters into the WM.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.552
The guy that gave us the inforn

14:47.596 --> 14:48.887
is her top lieutenant.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.157
Why is her lieutenant helping?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.223
He was in a relationship with.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.225
She got it out of himduring bed.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.603
Is she willing to testifyabout?

14:56.646 --> 14:58.104
No. Put surveillance in the.

14:58.148 --> 15:02.442
When Winters goes there andtake.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.359
What if it's a dry run like t?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.944
It won't be.

15:04.988 --> 15:08.156
This is exactly what the SAC.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.532
Once you seize the stash, we can.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.076
She's an opportunist.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.953
To save her own ass, she'll givd

15:13.997 --> 15:15.997
on the WMD peopleas well as Nec.

16:14.182 --> 16:17.016
Give it a restfor God's sa.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.979
If I've told you one thing, I...

16:23.274 --> 16:24.983
Well, well, well.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.987
Look who's here.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.622
What's this one's name?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.002
Stanl.

16:55.348 --> 16:55.972
Tuesday.

16:56.016 --> 17:00.059
2:30 p.m.

17:00.103 --> 17:02.344
I'm guessing Stanleydoesn't hav?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.188
Who's she?

17:04.232 --> 17:06.441
My ungrateful daughter.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.483
What do you want?

17:10.070 --> 17:13.781
You wanna know whyl'm ungratef?

17:13.825 --> 17:16.492
Because my mother spent herentif

17:16.536 --> 17:19.369
worthless shitheads like you

17:19.414 --> 17:22.749
instead of me.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.666
Is there a reason you're here?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.252
My therapist thoughtit was gon.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.298
And it wasn't.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.008
Get out.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.574
Sorry.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.993
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.001
Look, I know nowis not a good,

18:07.045 --> 18:10.463
but I really appreciate you gi.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.673
Not a good time?

18:12.717 --> 18:16.928
I've got cancer, not a cold.

18:16.971 --> 18:17.887
Look, neither one of us likes t,

18:17.931 --> 18:20.014
so let's not do it to each oth.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.060
All right.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.979
We were good together.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.441
No, we weren't.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.216
I'll get you a cup of tea be.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.989
Okay.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.993
You gonna call the boys now?

18:43.206 --> 18:44.997
No.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.043
Why not?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.407
I told you, I wanted to make it.

18:55.510 --> 18:58.719
What's going on?

18:58.763 --> 18:59.720
I need to think about stuff.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.848
You know, just because I'm out

19:01.891 --> 19:02.993
doesn't mean I get my... my badge.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.393
Well, they droppedthe case aga.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.061
Yeah, well...

19:07.105 --> 19:10.606
The department will need to doa.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.983
How long will that take?

19:13.653 --> 19:14.986
Two years, maybe more.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.450
I'm sure it'll work out.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.994
It will work out.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.238
'Cause I'll make sure it'll wo.

21:01.803 --> 21:04.011

- Le.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.767
What is it, Winters?

21:09.811 --> 21:11.091
Neckbone needs to talk to you.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.217
All right, what's the problem n?

21:16.651 --> 21:18.985
They found Sleep's body.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.969
I'm gonna make this quick,

21:45.013 --> 21:46.470
'cause I got a little brother.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.306
Just the boss man.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.016
Follow me.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.319
I'm starting to ask myself why.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.029
You don't.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.697
Berserkers have nevertaken a di.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.283

22:31.517 --> 22:33.017

22:38.649 --> 22:39.982
You heard about Kilvinsky?

22:41.903 --> 22:43.223
I heard he hada traffic accide.

22:44.614 --> 22:45.571
It wasn't an accident.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.365
Well, what was it then?

22:47.408 --> 22:48.991
Cry for help?

22:52.997 --> 22:56.624
Listen, Neck, we're all feelin.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.440
Careful.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.900
We're still cops.

Keep telling yourself that, H.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.874

23:43.756 --> 23:45.923
He got pushed into traffic.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.550
You need to check your boy, S.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.885
Why would I do that?

23:49.929 --> 23:50.636
You think we hadsomething to d?

23:50.680 --> 23:53.806
- Yeah. I do.
- Back off.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.428
That look on your face is bad.

24:11.617 --> 24:15.327
Whatever the issue is...

24:15.371 --> 24:16.371
talk it out.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.642
Not now.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.644
- Hear me out.
- Beach,

24:40.688 --> 24:41.479

24:41.522 --> 24:42.642

You, Ramos and Cole...

24:55.077 --> 24:56.357

Well...

26:46.814 --> 26:48.014

Hey, your kid's here.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.263
Hey.

27:22.516 --> 27:23.516
Surprise. Ha, ha.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.352
When did you get out?

27:26.395 --> 27:29.438
Yesterday.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.565
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

27:31.609 --> 27:32.983
Why you didn't tell me?

27:33.027 --> 27:37.112
I don't know, I just needed a.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.258
And I didn't wantyour brother t.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.199
Not yet.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.242
Why?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.371
Let's go outside, come on.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.997
Talk about it.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.677
IA's probably gonnatake their s.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.889
So, when it's finished,

28:03.933 --> 28:04.682
some favors are gonnahave to ben

28:04.725 --> 28:08.018
for me to get my badge back.

28:08.062 --> 28:09.728
There's plenty of people that.

28:09.772 --> 28:10.396
Yeah.-We'll get it back.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.399
Yeah, I know, I know.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.068
So, until then,

28:16.112 --> 28:18.487
I want to focus on straightenin.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.531
What do you mean?

28:21.033 --> 28:24.201
I've been talking to some of t.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.620
The pension's the lowest it'sbe.

28:26.664 --> 28:29.123
No real cash coming in.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.041
They're starting to think Steve.

28:33.504 --> 28:34.962
Everyone bitches.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.204
They were doing the samewhen yo.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.049
Yeah, but he's...

28:39.093 --> 28:40.253
He's running his own program.

28:43.180 --> 28:47.141
Keeping them in the dark about?

28:47.184 --> 28:48.424
Look how long it took him to c.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.730
Yeah, you just need to lay low.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.857
Look, running the club would s

28:54.900 --> 28:57.860
with the IA.-The club comes fir.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.183
And your brother'sin over his h.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.991
Now do I have your support or n?

30:27.117 --> 30:29.576
What do you want?

30:29.620 --> 30:31.161
I need a face to face,

30:31.205 --> 30:32.788
just the two of us.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.249
About what?-My storage locker?

30:35.292 --> 30:36.412
The one you paid a visit to.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.379
I don't know what you're talkin.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.839
Yeah, you do.

30:41.882 --> 30:43.465
So I've got two questionsfor yo.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.176
The first is, why didn't you tak?

30:46.220 --> 30:48.637
And the second is, why haven't?

30:48.681 --> 30:50.055
Is that what you want me to do?

30:50.099 --> 30:53.517
It's not about what I want. It.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.310
From you? Nothing.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.937
Bullshit.

30:56.981 --> 30:58.897
You didn't tell Neckbonewhat yo.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.649
It tells meyou're looking for a.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.151
So what are you offering?

31:03.195 --> 31:03.986
Not over the phone.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.988
- Not interested.
- You sure?

31:07.658 --> 31:08.991
I got your new guy, Byrd.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.579
So if you want him back alive,

31:13.622 --> 31:16.248
you're gonna have to convince m.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.797
Why'd you give him a headsup?

31:23.841 --> 31:26.049
These guys, they're a liability.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.010
I can't afford to havea liabili.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.095
Do you understand that? The F-

31:30.139 --> 31:31.513
- If word gets out you've beenset

31:31.557 --> 31:35.058
to stay afloat, the FDA is the l.

31:38.272 --> 31:40.772
If he was gonna tell someone, he.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.649
He's just looking for a payday.

31:42.693 --> 31:44.902
That's why cop gangs exist.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.988
To make money.

31:48.032 --> 31:48.989
I make the decisions about thi,

31:49.033 --> 31:50.991
not you.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.995
Not anymore you don't.

32:42.252 --> 32:43.252
What?

32:47.466 --> 32:50.008
We've got Byrd.

32:50.052 --> 32:51.802
Got him how? What are you talki?

32:51.845 --> 32:53.595
We grabbed him. Winters' orders.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.013
I didn't have a choice.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.895
You've had nothing but choices,

33:01.939 --> 33:03.772
you just keep making the wrong!

33:03.816 --> 33:06.024
All right, well my choice here

33:06.068 --> 33:07.859
is not being involved in killin.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.403
You want to knowwhere he is or?

33:09.446 --> 33:10.696
Of course I do.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.364
Why is Winters starting a war?

33:12.408 --> 33:15.033
She wants leverage, payback,.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.994
Bitch is on a warpath.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.414
He hurt?

33:20.457 --> 33:21.999
He's breathing.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.042
But that could change if you d.

33:31.093 --> 33:33.635
They're keeping him ata boatya.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.137
- Who's sitting on him?
- He di.

33:35.180 --> 33:38.724
He only had a short window toca.

33:38.767 --> 33:39.599
All right, you three go get h,

33:39.643 --> 33:42.060
I'll take the meet with Winters.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.603
What if they don't want to g?

33:43.647 --> 33:45.230
Do whatever you need to.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.984
We ain't killing another copov.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.819
That piece of shit goes down,.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.405
Federal supermax. Life sentence.

33:53.449 --> 33:54.990
If we're lucky.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.826
And just keep in mind,

33:57.870 --> 33:59.369
you could be walking intoa set...

33:59.413 --> 34:00.996
So could you.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.000
All right, let's go.
-

34:37.409 --> 34:40.284
- Where's Byrd?

34:40.329 --> 34:42.370
Not here.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.996
Is he alive?

34:46.335 --> 34:47.918
For now.

35:15.906 --> 35:16.488
Where do you thinkthey're hidi?

35:16.532 --> 35:18.615
How should I know?

35:18.659 --> 35:20.617
Shut up and stay focused.

35:20.661 --> 35:21.993
It's clear. Go that way.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.630
I'ma take around back.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.267
I wanna see him!

35:45.310 --> 35:47.978
First we need to come to an ag.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.190
What kind of agreement?

35:52.234 --> 35:56.027
You're walking around with som.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.049
Clear!

36:18.093 --> 36:20.343
Nothing back here.

36:20.387 --> 36:21.387
Same here.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.439
Shit.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.441
Foster lied, man.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.985
If that's the case, we're being.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.660
I get it.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.723
You don't want metelling Neckboe

36:46.747 --> 36:48.580
that your people killed his bro.

36:48.624 --> 36:49.998
They didn't kill Sleep.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.834
Then who did?-Don't play stupi.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.920
I know it was you and your guys.

36:56.506 --> 36:57.714
That's bullshit.

36:57.758 --> 37:00.008
It's not what your boy says.

37:03.055 --> 37:07.182
He took a lot of painbefore it,

37:07.226 --> 37:09.017
so don't judge him too hard.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.900
Wait a minute.

37:16.944 --> 37:17.984
You hear that?-

37:34.544 --> 37:36.253
- How do we fix this?

37:36.296 --> 37:38.922
Easy.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.246
You stay quietabout what you fo,

37:41.510 --> 37:44.094

37:48.225 --> 37:49.225
Go.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.356
What about my guy?

37:56.400 --> 37:57.983
I think I'll keep him for a li.

38:00.487 --> 38:02.988
Just until I seethat you're pla.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.992
Ready?-Yeah.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.245
Shit!

You okay?

38:16.878 --> 38:17.252
We'll get you out of here, rel.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.466
I can walk.-Come on. Show me.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.510
Go to your right.

38:35.981 --> 38:39.024

38:39.067 --> 38:43.028

38:43.071 --> 38:44.612
You really get offon this shit?

38:44.656 --> 38:45.989
It was Foster, wasn't it?

38:48.744 --> 38:50.952
How bad do you want to know?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.370
I can't have a snitch workin,

38:52.414 --> 38:55.123
