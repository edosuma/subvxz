00:33.366 --> 00:35.994
He was the phenomenon
of the twenties.

00:36.036 --> 00:40.302
When you think that he was
as well-known as Lindbergh...

00:40.340 --> 00:42.535
it's really quite astonishing.

00:45.245 --> 00:48.874
His story reflected the nature
of our civilization...

00:48.915 --> 00:50.883
the character of our times.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.943
Yet it was also
one man's story...

00:53.987 --> 00:57.445
and all the themes
of our culture were there...

00:57.490 --> 01:00.323
heroism, will,
things like that...

01:00.360 --> 01:04.227
but when you look back on it,
it was very strange.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.958
Well, it is ironic...

01:08.001 --> 01:11.129
to see how quickly
he has faded from memory...

01:11.171 --> 01:14.470
considering what
an astounding record he made.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.975
He was,
of course, very amusing...

01:17.010 --> 01:20.969
but at the same time
touched a nerve in people...

01:21.014 --> 01:26.475
perhaps in a way in which they
would prefer not to be touched.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.920
It certainly is
a very bizarre story.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.797
The year is 1928.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.799
America, enjoying a decade
of unequaled prosperity...

01:50.844 --> 01:52.402
has gone wild.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.572
The Jazz Age, it is called.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.277
The rhythms are syncopated.
The morals are looser.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.946
The liquor is cheaper,
when you can get it.

02:00.987 --> 02:06.425
It is a time of diverse heroes
and madcap stunts...

02:06.459 --> 02:10.258
of speak-easies
and flamboyant parties.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.094
One typical party occurs
at the Long Island estate...

02:13.133 --> 02:16.466
of Mr. And Mrs.
Henry Porter Sutton...

02:16.503 --> 02:19.563
socialites,
patrons of the arts.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.073
Politicians and poets...

02:21.107 --> 02:24.076
rub elbows
with the cream of high society.

02:24.110 --> 02:27.079
Present at the party
is Scott Fitzgerald...

02:27.113 --> 02:29.445
who is to cast perspective
on the twenties...

02:29.482 --> 02:31.780
for all future generations.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.149
He writes in his notebook...

02:33.186 --> 02:36.155
about a curious little man
named Leon Selwyn, or Zelman...

02:36.189 --> 02:39.158
who seemed clearly
to be an aristocrat...

02:39.192 --> 02:43.720
and extolled the very rich
as he chatted with socialites.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.732
He spoke adoringly of Coolidge
and the Republican Party...

02:46.766 --> 02:49.564
all in an upper-class
Boston accent.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.467
"An hour later,"
writes Fitzgerald...

02:51.504 --> 02:54.473
"I was stunned
to see the same man...

02:54.507 --> 02:56.475
"speaking with
the kitchen help.

02:56.509 --> 02:59.307
"Now he claimed
to be a Democrat...

02:59.345 --> 03:04.248
"and his accent seemed coarse,
as if he were one of the crowd."

03:04.284 --> 03:07.811
It's the first small notice
taken of Leonard Zelig.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.550
Florida, one year later.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.490
An odd incident occurs...

03:12.525 --> 03:15.494
at the New York Yankees'
training camp.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.428
Journalists,
anxious as always...

03:17.463 --> 03:21.627
to immortalize the exploits
of the great home-run hitters...

03:21.668 --> 03:23.636
notice a strange new player...

03:23.670 --> 03:26.639
waiting his turn at bat
after Babe Ruth.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.766
He's listed on the roster
as Lou Zelig...

03:28.808 --> 03:32.300
but no one on the team
has heard of him.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.437
Security guards are called...

03:33.479 --> 03:35.276
and he's escorted
from the premises.

03:35.315 --> 03:40.378
It appears as a small item
in the next day's newspaper.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.828
Chicago, Illinois,
that same year.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.955
There is a private party...

03:51.998 --> 03:54.831
at a speak-easy
on the South Side.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.062
People from the most
respectable walks of life...

03:57.103 --> 04:00.266
dance and drink bathtub gin.

04:04.911 --> 04:09.371
Present that evening
was Calvin Turner, a waiter.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.384
A lot of gangsters
come in the place.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.387
They're good tippers
and take care of us.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.786
We take care of our customers.

04:17.824 --> 04:21.281
On this particular night,
here's a strange guy coming in.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.090
I'd never seen him before.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.255
So I asked the one
or the other...

04:24.297 --> 04:26.094
I said, "John,
you know this guy?

04:26.132 --> 04:27.690
"You ever seen him?"
So he looks.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.463
"No. I ain't never
seen him before.

04:29.502 --> 04:30.696
"I don't know who he is...

04:30.737 --> 04:32.432
"but I know one thing...
he's a tough-Iooking hombre."

04:32.472 --> 04:34.201
So I looked over, and then...

04:34.240 --> 04:35.707
the next thing,
the guy had disappeared.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.040
I don't know where he went to.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.545
But about this time,
the music starts...

04:40.580 --> 04:42.707
and the band
started playing.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.708
I looked. Here's a colored boy
over there playing trumpet.

04:46.753 --> 04:50.382
Man, he was playing back,
and I looked at the guy...

04:50.423 --> 04:52.789
and I said, "He looks
just like that gangster...

04:52.825 --> 04:57.728
"but the gangster was white,
and this guy is black."

04:57.764 --> 05:00.790
So I don't know
what's happening.

05:00.867 --> 05:05.065
New York City.
It is several months later.

05:05.104 --> 05:09.040
Police are investigating
the disappearance of a clerk...

05:09.075 --> 05:10.542
named Leonard Zelig.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.874
Both his landlady
and his employer...

05:12.912 --> 05:14.709
have reported him missing.

05:14.747 --> 05:19.275
They tell police he was an odd
little man who kept to himself.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.379
Two clues are found in
Zelig's Greenwich Village flat.

05:22.422 --> 05:27.985
One, a photograph of Zelig
with Eugene O'Neill...

05:28.027 --> 05:31.292
and one of him as Pagliacci.

05:34.367 --> 05:39.236
Acting on a tip, they trace
his whereabouts to Chinatown...

05:39.272 --> 05:42.241
where, in the rear
of a Chinese establishment...

05:42.275 --> 05:44.300
a strange-Iooking Oriental...

05:44.344 --> 05:47.802
who fits the description
of Leonard Zelig is discovered.

05:47.847 --> 05:51.305
Suspicious, the detectives
try to pull off his disguise...

05:51.351 --> 05:55.788
but it is not a disguise,
and a fight breaks out.

05:55.822 --> 05:59.622
He is removed by force
and taken to Manhattan Hospital.

05:59.659 --> 06:02.719
In the ambulance,
he rants and curses...

06:02.762 --> 06:05.230
in what sounds
like authentic Chinese.

06:05.264 --> 06:08.631
He is restrained
with a straitjacket.

06:08.668 --> 06:12.126
When he emerges from the car
twenty minutes later...

06:12.171 --> 06:16.801
incredibly, he is no longer
Chinese, but Caucasian.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.812
Bewildered interns place him
in the emergency room...

06:19.846 --> 06:21.814
for observation.

06:21.848 --> 06:25.545
At 7 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher,
a psychiatrist...

06:25.585 --> 06:28.816
makes her usual rounds.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.824
When I first heard
about this emergency case...

06:31.858 --> 06:33.826
I didn't think
anything peculiar...

06:33.860 --> 06:36.829
and when I first
laid eyes on him...

06:36.863 --> 06:42.893
it was a bit strange because
I mistook him for a doctor.

06:42.935 --> 06:46.530
He had a very professional
demeanor about him.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.437
As a young psychiatrist...

06:48.474 --> 06:51.443
Eudora Fletcher is fascinated
by Leonard Zelig.

06:51.477 --> 06:54.776
She convinces the conservative
staff at the hospital...

06:54.814 --> 06:57.647
to allow her to pursue
a study of the new admission.

06:57.683 --> 07:00.083
So, what do you do?

07:00.119 --> 07:02.110
Oh, me? I'm a psychiatrist.

07:03.456 --> 07:07.187
I work mostly
with delusional paranoids.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.285
Tell me about it.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.795
There's not much to tell.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.298
I work mostly
on the continent...

07:13.332 --> 07:16.301
and I've written quite a few
psychoanalytic papers.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.133
I worked with Freud in Vienna.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.970
We broke over the concept
of penis envy.

07:22.008 --> 07:26.035
Freud felt that it
should be limited to women.

07:26.078 --> 07:30.037
It's not that he was
making any sense at all.

07:30.082 --> 07:33.051
It was a conglomeration
of psychological double-talk...

07:33.085 --> 07:35.053
that he had apparently heard...

07:35.087 --> 07:37.351
or was familiar with
through reading.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.290
The funny thing was
his delivery was quite fluid...

07:39.325 --> 07:41.793
and might have been
convincing...

07:41.828 --> 07:45.025
to someone
who did not know any better.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.033
Who was this Leonard Zelig
that seemed to create...

07:48.067 --> 07:50.035
such diverse impressions
everywhere?

07:50.069 --> 07:54.062
All that was known of him
was that he was the son...

07:54.106 --> 07:57.075
of a Yiddish actor
named Morris Zelig...

07:57.109 --> 07:58.974
whose performance as Puck...

07:59.011 --> 08:02.412
in the Orthodox version of
"A Midsummer Night's Dream"...

08:02.448 --> 08:04.916
was coolly received.

08:04.951 --> 08:07.010
The elder Zelig's
second marriage...

08:07.053 --> 08:10.750
is marked by constant violent
quarreling, so much so...

08:10.790 --> 08:13.759
that although the family
lives over a bowling alley...

08:13.793 --> 08:16.990
it's the bowling alley
that complains of noise.

08:17.029 --> 08:21.591
As a boy, Leonard is frequently
bullied by anti-Semites.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.603
His parents,
who never take his part...

08:24.637 --> 08:28.630
and blame him for everything,
side with the anti-Semites.

08:28.674 --> 08:32.610
They punish him often
by locking him in a dark closet.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.613
When they are really angry...

08:34.647 --> 08:37.342
they get into the closet
with him.

08:37.383 --> 08:40.352
On his deathbed,
Morris Zelig tells his son...

08:40.385 --> 08:43.355
that life is a meaningless
nightmare of suffering...

08:43.389 --> 08:48.486
and the only advice he gives him
is to save string.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.292
Though brother Jack
has a nervous breakdown...

08:51.330 --> 08:54.663
and sister Ruth becomes
a shoplifter and alcoholic...

08:54.700 --> 08:58.136
Leonard Zelig appears
to have adjusted to life.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.071
Somehow, he seems to have coped.

09:01.107 --> 09:06.602
And then, suddenly,
increasingly strange behavior.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.145
Fascinated
by the Zelig phenomenon...

09:11.183 --> 09:14.152
Dr. Fletcher arranges
a series of experiments...

09:14.186 --> 09:17.713
and invites the skeptical staff
to observe.

09:17.757 --> 09:23.593
With the doctors watching, Zelig
becomes a perfect psychiatrist.

09:23.629 --> 09:27.087
When two Frenchmen
are brought in...

09:27.133 --> 09:31.035
Zelig assumes their characters
and speaks reasonable French.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.039
In the company
of a Chinese person...

09:34.073 --> 09:37.304
he begins to develop
Oriental features.

09:37.343 --> 09:40.801
By now, word has gotten out
to the press...

09:40.846 --> 09:43.815
and the public, thirsting
for thrills and novelty...

09:43.849 --> 09:46.147
is immediately captivated.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.487
The clamor is so great...

09:51.524 --> 09:55.426
that Dr. Allan Sindell
is forced to issue a statement.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.952
We're beginning
to realize the dimensions...

09:57.997 --> 10:01.125
of what could be the scientific
medical phenomenon of the age...

10:01.167 --> 10:03.567
and possibly of all time.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.935
Fresh stories roll off
the press every day...

10:05.972 --> 10:08.998
about Zelig
and his puzzling condition.

10:09.041 --> 10:13.000
Although the doctors claim
to have the situation in hand...

10:13.045 --> 10:16.446
no two can agree
on a diagnosis.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.973
I'm convinced
it's glandular in nature...

10:19.018 --> 10:21.486
and although there's
no evidence of misfunction...

10:21.520 --> 10:24.921
further tests will show
a problem in the secretions.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.222
It's something he picked up
from eating Mexican food.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.728
This manifestation
is neurological in origin.

10:30.763 --> 10:34.221
This patient is suffering
from a brain tumor...

10:34.266 --> 10:39.169
and I should not be surprised
if within several weeks he died.

10:39.205 --> 10:43.164
We have not been able
to locate the tumor...

10:43.209 --> 10:45.074
but we're still looking.

10:45.111 --> 10:48.672
Ironically,
within two weeks' time...

10:48.714 --> 10:52.673
it is Dr. Birsky himself
who dies of a brain tumor.

10:52.718 --> 10:55.482
Leonard Zelig is fine.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.681
Throughout the weeks
of testing and speculation...

10:58.724 --> 11:00.624
Eudora Fletcher
begins to feel...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.128
that the patient
might be suffering...

11:03.162 --> 11:05.130
not from
a physiological disorder...

11:05.164 --> 11:07.632
but from a psychological one.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.125
It is Zelig's unstable makeup,
she suggests...

11:11.170 --> 11:13.138
that accounts
for his metamorphoses.

11:13.172 --> 11:18.132
The governing board of doctors
is hostile to her notion.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.145
They conclude
that Zelig's malady...

11:20.179 --> 11:23.637
can be traced to poor alignment
of the vertebrae.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.345
Tests prove them wrong...

11:26.385 --> 11:29.377
and cause a temporary problem
for the patient.

11:31.057 --> 11:35.517
Now the press and public
hang on every bit of news...

11:35.561 --> 11:38.587
thoroughly absorbed
in the real-life drama.

11:38.631 --> 11:42.431
The continuing saga
at Manhattan Hospital goes on.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.631
This morning, doctors report,
experiments were conducted.

11:45.671 --> 11:49.004
Several women were placed
in proximity to the subject...

11:49.041 --> 11:50.941
but no change occurred...

11:50.976 --> 11:52.773
leading authorities
to conclude...

11:52.812 --> 11:54.643
that the phenomenon
does not occur with women.

11:54.680 --> 11:59.014
Doctors will experiment
with a midget and a chicken.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.958
Leonard Zelig continues
to astound scientists...

12:07.993 --> 12:11.053
at New York's
Manhattan Hospital...

12:11.097 --> 12:13.463
where numerous tests
have led nowhere...

12:13.499 --> 12:16.229
in determining the nature of
this astonishing manifestation.

12:16.268 --> 12:19.237
He is confronted
by two overweight men...

12:19.271 --> 12:21.739
at the request of the doctors.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.242
As the men
discuss their obesity...

12:24.276 --> 12:26.744
an initially reticent Zelig
joins in...

12:26.779 --> 12:30.146
swelling himself
to a miraculous 250 pounds.

12:30.182 --> 12:33.379
Next, in the presence
of two Negro men...

12:33.419 --> 12:36.650
Zelig rapidly
becomes one himself.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.385
What will they think of next?

12:39.425 --> 12:44.328
Meanwhile, Americans all over
have their own reactions.

12:44.363 --> 12:48.026
I wish I could be Lenny Zelig,
the changing man.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.864
I'd be different people.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.166
Someday my wishes
will come true.

12:52.204 --> 12:56.664
Leonard Zelig is
one of the finest gentlemen...

12:56.709 --> 12:59.177
in the United States of America.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.738
He is the cat's pajamas.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.682
Trying a new approach...

13:04.717 --> 13:07.777
Dr. Fletcher places the subject
under hypnosis.

13:07.820 --> 13:12.018
Tell me why you assume
the characteristics...

13:12.057 --> 13:14.025
of the person you're with.

13:14.059 --> 13:19.622
- It's safe.
- What do you mean safe?

13:19.665 --> 13:22.634
Safe...

13:22.668 --> 13:26.126
to be like the others.

13:26.172 --> 13:30.131
You want to be safe?

13:30.176 --> 13:33.145
I want to be liked.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.247
Probing Zelig's unconscious...

13:36.282 --> 13:39.251
Dr. Fletcher gradually
puts together the pieces...

13:39.285 --> 13:42.413
of Zelig's behavioral puzzle.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.922
Dividing her time
between the hospital...

13:44.957 --> 13:49.053
and the 42nd-Street Library,
she writes her report.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.562
A closed meeting
of doctors listens...

13:51.597 --> 13:56.159
as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig
as a human chameleon.

13:56.202 --> 13:59.171
Like the lizard
that is endowed by nature...

13:59.205 --> 14:01.105
with a marvelous
protective device...

14:01.140 --> 14:03.574
that enables it
to change color...

14:03.609 --> 14:06.578
and blend in with
its immediate surrounding...

14:06.612 --> 14:08.671
Zelig, too, protects himself...

14:08.714 --> 14:11.842
by becoming
whoever he is around.

14:11.884 --> 14:14.853
The doctors listen,
and their reaction is skeptical.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.117
"Impossible," they claim.
"Preposterous."

14:17.156 --> 14:20.125
"If he's a lizard,"
quips one doctor...

14:20.159 --> 14:23.128
"then we shouldn't spend
hospital money feeding him...

14:23.162 --> 14:25.687
"but simply catch him
some flies."

14:35.174 --> 14:38.143
We knew we had
a good story this time...

14:38.177 --> 14:40.668
because it had everything in it.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.181
It had romance.
It had suspense.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.184
This fellow Zelig,
he grew up poor.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.186
My city editor said, "Ted...

14:48.220 --> 14:52.680
"we want this story
on page one every day."

14:52.725 --> 14:56.684
In those days, you'd do anything
to sell papers.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.698
To get a story,
you'd jazz it up...

14:59.732 --> 15:02.132
you'd exaggerate,
play with the truth.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.965
Here was a story.
It was a natural.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.802
You told the truth,
and it sold papers.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.671
It never happened before.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.676
Overnight,
Leonard Zelig has become...

15:11.710 --> 15:14.304
the main topic
of conversation everywhere...

15:14.346 --> 15:17.315
and is discussed with amusement
and wonder.

15:17.349 --> 15:20.807
No social gathering is without
its Leonard Zelig joke...

15:20.853 --> 15:23.822
and in a decade
of popular dance crazes...

15:23.856 --> 15:25.756
a new one
sweeps the nation.

16:38.797 --> 16:41.766
What's brown, white,
and yellow with four eyes?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.826
Leonard Zelig
at the League of Nations.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.337
Not everyone, however...

16:46.372 --> 16:48.897
was entranced
by the human chameleon...

16:48.941 --> 16:50.806
and amongst the fanatics...

16:50.843 --> 16:53.744
he was a handy symbol
of iniquity.

16:53.779 --> 16:58.148
This creature
personifies Capitalist man.

16:58.183 --> 17:03.644
A creature who takes
many forms to achieve ends...

17:03.689 --> 17:09.184
the exploitation of the workers
by deception.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.922
To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig...

17:13.965 --> 17:16.935
a Jew who was able
to transform himself...

17:16.969 --> 17:20.496
into a Negro or Indian,
was a triple threat.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.598
Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher...

17:22.641 --> 17:25.108
certain that her findings
are correct...

17:25.144 --> 17:27.612
begs for time
with her patient...

17:27.646 --> 17:30.376
to put her theories
into operation.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.976
You recall
the first time you began...

17:33.018 --> 17:36.613
behaving like the people
you were around?

17:36.655 --> 17:40.113
In school,
some very bright people...

17:40.159 --> 17:43.128
asked me if I read "Moby Dick."

17:44.663 --> 17:48.121
I was ashamed to say
I never read it.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.634
And you pretended?

17:51.170 --> 17:54.628
When did the changes
begin happening automatically?

17:54.673 --> 17:56.664
Years ago.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.175
Saint Patrick's Day.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.077
I wandered into a bar.

18:01.113 --> 18:04.139
Wasn't wearing green.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.151
They made remarks.

18:06.185 --> 18:08.153
I turned Irish.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.655
You told them you were Irish?

18:10.689 --> 18:14.648
My hair turned red.
My nose turned up.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.719
Spoke about
the great potato famine...

18:17.763 --> 18:21.028
and the little people.

18:21.066 --> 18:24.035
We do not agree
with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.

18:24.069 --> 18:27.596
We believe those ideas
are pipe dreams.

18:27.639 --> 18:30.608
We believe that any change
in Zelig's condition...

18:30.642 --> 18:33.110
is going to be brought about...

18:33.145 --> 18:34.612
through certain
experimental drugs...

18:34.646 --> 18:38.446
which although risky,
have been known to work wonders.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.544
Zelig is treated
with the experimental drug...

18:41.587 --> 18:43.714
somadril hydrate.

18:43.755 --> 18:45.723
He undergoes
severe mood changes...

18:45.757 --> 18:50.558
and for several days
will not come off the wall.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.655
Then suddenly...

18:52.698 --> 18:56.156
as Dr. Fletcher is beginning
to make some progress...

18:56.201 --> 18:58.669
the question of Zelig's fate
takes a new twist...

18:58.704 --> 19:02.606
as his half sister Ruth
removes him from the hospital.

19:02.641 --> 19:06.600
"He can be better cared for
at home," she tells the doctors.

19:06.645 --> 19:11.105
He'll be looked after by her
and her lover Martin Geist...

19:11.150 --> 19:15.109
a businessman
and ex-carnival promoter.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.123
There is very little resistance
amongst the doctors...

19:18.157 --> 19:22.059
who are relieved to be rid
of the frustrating case.

19:22.094 --> 19:26.053
Only Dr. Fletcher cares
about Zelig as a human being.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.931
She insists he desperately needs
special care...

19:28.967 --> 19:30.832
but it is to no avail.

19:30.869 --> 19:34.828
No one was questioning
her legal right to Zelig.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.842
She was his half sister
and his guardian...

19:37.876 --> 19:40.902
but she had a strange
boyfriend called Geist.

19:40.946 --> 19:44.905
He'd been in jail
for real-estate fraud.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.817
He was selling
the same piece of property...

19:47.853 --> 19:49.821
to a lot of people.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.790
A Delaware Congressman
bought it twice.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.792
The crowds
that line the roads...

19:54.826 --> 19:59.286
to glimpse the human chameleon
tie up traffic for days.

19:59.331 --> 20:02.323
He's a sight to behold
for tourists and children.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.598
People from all over the country
fight for space...

20:05.637 --> 20:08.105
to peek at this new wonderment.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.017
Selling mementos
while her brother...

20:19.051 --> 20:21.281
is allowed
to be on exhibition...

20:21.320 --> 20:25.051
is only the beginning
for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.957
Admission is charged for
twice-daily demonstrations...

20:27.993 --> 20:30.120
of Leonard's stunning prowess.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.130
He does not disappoint...

20:32.164 --> 20:35.133
changing appearance
over and over upon demand.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.126
Overnight, he has become
an attraction, a novelty...

20:39.171 --> 20:41.799
a freak.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.970
In this 1935 film
based on the life of Zelig...

20:46.011 --> 20:49.003
called "The Changing Man"...

20:49.047 --> 20:51.015
the atmosphere
is best summed up.

20:51.049 --> 20:54.018
We can't give up
custody of Leonard.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.520
I know, if given the chance,
I can cure him.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.718
Even our attorney
says it's hopeless.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.693
Dr. Fletcher...
may I call you Eudora?

21:02.728 --> 21:04.696
Somewhere behind
that vacuous face...

21:04.730 --> 21:06.197
that zombielike stare...

21:06.231 --> 21:10.099
is a real human being,
and I can bring it out.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.295
How?

21:11.336 --> 21:13.270
Some new way, some technique.

21:13.305 --> 21:16.900
Whatever it is,
it will have to be personal.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.410
There's not much
I can do legally.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.912
They don't care.
They'll exploit him.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.916
They see a chance to make money.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.851
Look. They're selling
this Leonard Zelig doll.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.854
The film did not exaggerate.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.346
There weren't only Leonard Zelig
pens and lucky charms...

21:33.392 --> 21:36.361
but clocks and toys,
watches and books...

21:36.395 --> 21:39.626
and a famous Leonard Zelig doll.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.257
There were aprons,
chameleon-shaped earmuffs...

21:41.300 --> 21:43.632
and a popular
Leonard Zelig game.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.675
There were many popular songs...

22:31.717 --> 22:35.517
inspired by Leonard Zelig,
tunes that swept the nation.

22:58.844 --> 23:01.642
In addition to
the products and endorsements...

23:01.680 --> 23:04.046
there are
the endless exhibitions.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.482
In Hollywood,
he's a great favorite...

23:06.518 --> 23:09.146
and is offered a film contract.

23:09.187 --> 23:12.156
Clara Bow invites him
for a private weekend...

23:12.190 --> 23:14.954
and tells him to bring
all his personalities.

23:14.993 --> 23:18.793
In Chicago, he meets heavyweight
champion Jack Dempsey...

23:18.830 --> 23:21.799
who clowns with Zelig
at his training camp.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.131
In Washington, D.C.,
he is introduced...

23:24.169 --> 23:27.195
to both Calvin Coolidge
and Herbert Hoover.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.208
In France, he is hailed
as Le Lezard.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.803
He is the toast
of the Parisian music halls.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.814
His performance endears him to
leading French intellectuals...

23:36.848 --> 23:40.648
who see in him
a symbol for everything.

23:40.685 --> 23:43.313
His transformation
into a rabbi...

23:43.355 --> 23:45.823
is so realistic
that certain Frenchmen...

23:45.857 --> 23:49.588
suggest he be sent
to Devil's Island.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.088
At the Folies Bergere...

23:54.132 --> 23:57.590
Josephine Baker does her version
of the Chameleon Dance...

23:57.636 --> 23:59.536
and later tells friends...

23:59.571 --> 24:03.371
she finds Zelig amazing,
but a little lost.

24:03.408 --> 24:06.673
Everyone used to be
at my place...

24:06.711 --> 24:09.179
everyone who was someone...

24:09.214 --> 24:14.675
and occasionally
someone would bring Zelig in...

24:14.719 --> 24:16.186
Leonard in.

24:16.221 --> 24:20.681
Cole Porter
was fascinated by Leonard...

24:20.725 --> 24:24.183
and he once
wrote a line in a song...

24:24.229 --> 24:29.690
"You're the tops.
You're Leonard Zelig."

24:29.734 --> 24:34.398
But then he couldn't find
anything to rhyme with Zelig.

24:40.512 --> 24:43.072
I'm flying high

24:43.114 --> 24:46.311
'Cause I've got a feeling
I'm falling

24:46.351 --> 24:53.052
Falling for nobody else but you

24:53.091 --> 24:54.854
You caught my eye

24:54.893 --> 24:58.420
Now I got a feeling I'm falling

24:58.463 --> 25:02.991
Show me that ring,
and I'll jump right through

25:03.034 --> 25:06.629
I used to travel single, oh

25:06.671 --> 25:09.936
We chanced to mingle, oh

25:09.975 --> 25:14.503
Now I'm a-tingle over you

25:14.546 --> 25:18.141
Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by

25:18.183 --> 25:21.482
'Cause I've got a feeling
I'm falling

25:21.520 --> 25:26.150
Falling for nobody else but you

25:26.191 --> 25:27.590
Wow!

25:27.626 --> 25:30.094
Though the shows and parties...

25:30.128 --> 25:33.620
keep Zelig's sister
and her lover rich and amused...

25:33.665 --> 25:36.133
Zelig's own existence
is a nonexistence.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.634
Devoid of personality...

25:37.669 --> 25:42.129
his human qualities long since
lost in the shuffle of life...

25:42.173 --> 25:45.142
he sits alone,
quietly staring into space...

25:45.176 --> 25:50.136
a cipher, a nonperson,
a performing freak.

25:50.181 --> 25:53.639
He who wanted only to fit in,
to belong...

25:53.685 --> 25:57.644
to go unseen by his enemies
and be loved...

25:57.689 --> 26:01.090
neither fits in nor belongs...

26:01.126 --> 26:05.392
is supervised by enemies,
and remains uncared for.

26:05.430 --> 26:09.958
The board at the hospital
has all but forgotten Zelig.

26:10.001 --> 26:13.493
Only Dr. Fletcher continues
to fight for his custody.

26:13.538 --> 26:17.065
The court turns
her final appeal down.

26:17.108 --> 26:19.076
Throughout her valiant
legal battle...

26:19.110 --> 26:23.308
she is frequently in the company
of her attorney Charles Koslow.

26:23.348 --> 26:25.646
He falls in love with her...

26:25.684 --> 26:28.744
and presses
for her hand in marriage.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.254
She is ambivalent.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.756
Reluctantly,
she is beginning to abandon...

26:32.791 --> 26:36.352
all hope of recovering
Leonard Zelig.

26:36.394 --> 26:41.195
That summer,
Geist has booked them in Spain.

26:41.232 --> 26:44.668
It is the last leg
of a European tour...

26:44.703 --> 26:46.694
that has been wildly successful.

26:46.738 --> 26:49.707
Relations between Martin Geist
and Ruth Zelig...

26:49.741 --> 26:51.709
have grown strained.

26:51.743 --> 26:54.712
They have become bored
with one another...

26:54.746 --> 26:56.213
and quarrel frequently.

26:56.247 --> 26:59.705
The situation grows worse
when she meets Luis Martinez...

26:59.751 --> 27:02.845
a mediocre
and cowardly bullfighter...

27:02.887 --> 27:04.878
with whom she falls in love.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.060
Though he wishes
to impress Ruth Zelig...

27:09.094 --> 27:12.393
Martinez displays
his usual panic in the arena.

27:12.430 --> 27:14.728
Good fortune is
with him, however...

27:14.766 --> 27:17.132
as the bull gives himself
a brain concussion.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.636
Martinez takes credit
for the kill...

27:19.671 --> 27:21.969
and cutting off
the bull's ear...

27:22.007 --> 27:24.805
presents it to his lover
with great bravado.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.141
That evening,
in a jealous rage...

27:27.178 --> 27:30.045
Martin Geist returns
to his hotel room...

27:30.081 --> 27:32.174
and confronts Ruth Zelig.

27:32.217 --> 27:35.277
He demands that she
give him the ear.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.685
She refuses.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.690
Geist insists upon
possession of the ear.

27:39.724 --> 27:42.488
They quarrel furiously,
and Martinez is discovered...

27:42.527 --> 27:44.654
hiding in the closet.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.664
Geist pulls a revolver
and shoots him.

27:46.698 --> 27:50.156
He turns the gun on Zelig's
half sister and kills her.

27:50.201 --> 27:52.499
Then he takes his own life.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.165
In an orgy
of jealous violence...

27:55.206 --> 27:58.198
Leonard Zelig's life
is turned upside down.

28:13.658 --> 28:17.856
At first, the news reverberates
around the world.

28:17.896 --> 28:20.126
Then, just as quickly...

28:20.165 --> 28:23.032
the thrill-hungry public
becomes apathetic.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.662
Fresh scandals appear
and make headlines.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.673
Events in the Jazz Age
move too rapidly...

28:28.707 --> 28:30.766
like Red Grange.

28:30.809 --> 28:35.303
A population glutted with
distractions is quick to forget.

28:35.346 --> 28:37.906
The twenties come
to a crashing climax...

28:37.949 --> 28:40.941
and still, Leonard Zelig
is nowhere to be found.

28:45.824 --> 28:50.693
Dr. Eudora Fletcher
searches in vain to locate him.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.197
When several leads
prove disappointing...

28:53.231 --> 28:55.859
she gives up, discouraged.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.697
I felt it was a shame.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.704
Here was this unique case...

28:59.738 --> 29:02.639
that I could make
my reputation on.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.643
Not that I knew
how to cure him...

29:05.677 --> 29:08.646
but if I could
have him alone...

29:08.680 --> 29:12.138
and feel my way and be
innovative and creative...

29:12.183 --> 29:15.152
I felt that I could
change his life...

29:15.186 --> 29:17.814
if I only had the chance.

29:26.231 --> 29:30.167
300,000 of the faithful are
waiting before St. Peter's...

29:30.201 --> 29:32.533
for the appearance
of Pope Pius XI.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.663
Borne on the shoulders
of twelve attendants...

29:34.706 --> 29:37.675
the seat of the Adjustortoria
carrying the Holy Father...

29:37.709 --> 29:39.677
is drawn out
to the central balcony...

29:39.711 --> 29:43.078
where he bestows his
blessings on all the world.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.674
This is the first time this
ritual has been performed...

29:45.717 --> 29:50.677
in 63 years and brings
to a climax on Easter Sunday...

29:50.722 --> 29:52.690
the religious ceremonies
of Holy Week.

29:52.724 --> 29:56.182
What's this? A commotion
next to the Papal Father?

29:56.227 --> 29:58.195
Somebody doesn't
belong up there.

29:58.229 --> 30:00.197
The guards are summoned
amidst chaos...

30:00.231 --> 30:02.199
as His Holiness Pope Pius XI...

30:02.233 --> 30:05.202
tries to swat the intruder
with his sacred decree.

30:05.236 --> 30:07.204
The faithful can't believe it.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.365
It is, of course, Zelig.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.875
He's returned
to the United States...

30:11.910 --> 30:14.344
by Italian authorities...

30:14.379 --> 30:17.473
and readmitted
to Manhattan Hospital.

30:17.515 --> 30:20.678
I welcome this opportunity
to treat Leonard Zelig...

30:20.718 --> 30:25.178
now that he is back
as a ward of the hospital.

30:25.223 --> 30:28.681
I'm grateful the board
has given me this chance.

30:28.726 --> 30:31.695
I sincerely hope
to return him to society...

30:31.729 --> 30:33.697
a useful,
self-possessed citizen...

30:33.731 --> 30:37.690
no longer a curiosity
with no life of his own.

30:37.735 --> 30:41.535
Dr. Fletcher has no time now
to think of marriage.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.440
All her attention must be
devoted to Leonard Zelig.

30:44.475 --> 30:48.411
Her plan is to bring him
to her country home.

30:48.446 --> 30:52.246
She will set up a neutral
environment away from society.

30:52.283 --> 30:56.743
She will begin searching for
some new way to treat him...

30:56.788 --> 30:59.586
in the hopes of penetrating
his unique malady.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.684
Aware of the significance
of her work...

31:02.727 --> 31:05.696
Eudora Fletcher arranges
to keep a filmed record...

31:05.730 --> 31:07.698
of the proceedings.

31:07.732 --> 31:11.691
For this, she contacts
her first cousin Paul Deghuee...

31:11.736 --> 31:15.433
an inventor
and part-time photographer.

31:15.473 --> 31:20.240
She said, "I want to make
a record of this case...

31:20.278 --> 31:23.247
"for future generations
and the world of science.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.249
"I want you to keep
the camera very quiet."

31:25.283 --> 31:29.743
I said, "Why not just
take notes and write it up?"

31:29.787 --> 31:31.755
She said, "Paul, when a man...

31:31.789 --> 31:35.748
"changes his physical
appearance, you want to see it.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.761
"You can't read about it.

31:37.795 --> 31:40.491
"Besides which,
I am planning to make history."

31:40.531 --> 31:43.625
The white room
is carefully arranged...

31:43.668 --> 31:45.636
for maximum serenity.

31:45.670 --> 31:49.128
It is a small study
in Dr. Fletcher's house...

31:49.173 --> 31:51.141
sparsely furnished.

31:51.175 --> 31:55.134
Clumsy photographic lights
are nailed to the wall...

31:55.179 --> 31:58.842
to provide
sufficient illumination.

31:58.883 --> 32:02.410
Microphones are hidden
in specially selected places.

32:02.453 --> 32:05.718
The camera shoots
through a pane of glass...

32:05.757 --> 32:07.884
which renders it
relatively unobtrusive.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.759
The noise of the motor
is a problem.

32:10.795 --> 32:15.255
This is muffled with a blanket
and anything else handy.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.268
From this cramped
vantage point...

32:17.302 --> 32:19.167
photographer Paul Deghuee
will record...

32:19.203 --> 32:21.671
the famous
White Room Sessions...

32:21.706 --> 32:25.938
a remarkable document
in the history of psychotherapy.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.706
By today's standards...

32:27.745 --> 32:31.704
the White Room Sessions
would seem very primitive...

32:31.749 --> 32:35.207
and yet they were
really quite effective...

32:35.253 --> 32:38.711
in developing a very strong
personal relation...

32:38.756 --> 32:40.747
between doctor and patient.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.228
The question whether
Zelig was a psychotic...

32:44.262 --> 32:47.231
or merely extremely neurotic...

32:47.265 --> 32:50.723
was a question
that was endlessly discussed...

32:50.768 --> 32:52.736
among us doctors.

32:52.770 --> 32:57.730
I myself felt that
his feelings were really...

32:57.775 --> 33:00.676
not all that different
from the normal...

33:00.712 --> 33:02.339
maybe what one would call...

33:02.380 --> 33:04.678
the well-adjusted
normal person...

33:04.716 --> 33:07.184
only carried
to an extreme degree...

33:07.218 --> 33:09.186
to an extreme extent.

33:09.220 --> 33:12.189
I myself felt that one could...

33:12.223 --> 33:16.091
really think of him
as the ultimate conformist.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.723
Leonard, do you know
why you're here?

33:24.736 --> 33:26.704
To discuss psychiatry, right?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.706
You're a doctor?

33:28.740 --> 33:30.708
Yes, I am.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.210
Perhaps you've read
my latest paper...

33:33.244 --> 33:35.212
on delusional paranoia.

33:35.246 --> 33:38.215
Turns out
the entire thing is mental.

33:38.249 --> 33:43.710
Suppose I tell you
you're not a doctor.

33:43.755 --> 33:49.216
I would say
that you're making a joke.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.229
Incidentally, is it
always so bright in here?

33:52.263 --> 33:56.222
I'm recording these sessions
on film, if you don't mind.

33:56.267 --> 33:57.734
There's somebody
behind there, right?

33:57.769 --> 34:00.670
That's right.
That's a camera.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.175
Why don't we start
with simple reality.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.177
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.681
You're a patient,
and I'm the doctor.

34:11.716 --> 34:17.177
I wouldn't tell it to
too many people if I were you.

34:17.221 --> 34:19.688
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.693
Is she going to be all right?

34:22.726 --> 34:26.185
I've got to get back to town.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.697
Really. I have
an interesting case...

34:28.733 --> 34:31.201
treating two sets
of Siamese twins...

34:31.235 --> 34:32.702
with split personalities.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.466
I'm getting paid
by eight people.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.906
"The first week's sessions
did not go too well..."

34:37.942 --> 34:40.409
writes Dr. Fletcher
in her diary.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.413
"Leonard identifies with me...

34:42.447 --> 34:45.416
"and is convinced
that he is a doctor.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.509
"He is guarded and suspicious.

34:47.552 --> 34:50.418
"There is something
very appealing about him, too.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.422
"He's quick-witted
and energetic.

34:52.456 --> 34:56.257
"Perhaps it is his very
helplessness that moves me.

34:56.293 --> 35:00.355
"I must keep flexible
and play the situation by ear."

35:01.899 --> 35:03.890
How are you today, Leonard?

35:05.403 --> 35:09.863
Fine.
I got to get back to town soon.

35:09.907 --> 35:12.375
I teach a course...

35:12.410 --> 35:15.868
at the Psychiatric Institute
on masturbation.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.380
I see.

35:17.415 --> 35:19.383
I'm a doctor, and I...

35:19.417 --> 35:21.385
Guilt-related masturbation.

35:21.419 --> 35:24.388
Not guilt-related.
I teach advanced.

35:24.422 --> 35:27.391
I'm quite
a respected doctor there.

35:27.425 --> 35:29.893
Let your eyes follow this pen.

35:29.927 --> 35:33.556
Just let yourself
breathe deeply.

35:33.598 --> 35:35.225
Relax.

35:35.266 --> 35:37.393
You're trying to hypnotize me.

35:37.435 --> 35:40.404
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I mind. I'm a doctor.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.406
You're not a doctor.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.408
I am a doctor.

35:44.442 --> 35:45.909
Just relax.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.911
I can't.
I'm due back in town.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.913
I have this
masturbation class.

35:49.947 --> 35:52.882
If I'm not there,
they start without me.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.942
As the weeks go by...

35:54.986 --> 35:57.955
Dr. Fletcher grows
more and more frustrated.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.890
"Leonard continues
to insist he is a doctor...

36:00.925 --> 36:04.383
"and even refuses to let me
hypnotize him," she writes.

36:04.428 --> 36:07.397
"I believe his experiences
of the past year...

36:07.431 --> 36:10.229
"have made him
more defensive than ever.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.633
"It is discouraging."

36:11.669 --> 36:13.569
She was under great pressure.

36:13.604 --> 36:16.573
You could tell.
She was moody and nervous.

36:16.607 --> 36:21.340
He was fine, napping,
sitting in his chair reading.

36:21.379 --> 36:24.348
He referred to himself
as Dr. Zelig.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.907
He was reading
books on psychiatry.

36:26.951 --> 36:30.409
I told her to get away
for a day and relax.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.922
The strain was
becoming too much.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.686
Leaving Zelig alone...

36:34.725 --> 36:37.250
Dr. Fletcher takes
Paul Deghuee's advice...

36:37.295 --> 36:41.425
and she and her fiance
spend some hours off, relaxing.

36:41.465 --> 36:45.526
They go to Broadway, then
to a well-known nightclub...

36:45.570 --> 36:47.936
where, despite
a lively stage show...

36:47.972 --> 36:50.440
Dr. Fletcher
is distracted and uneasy.

36:50.474 --> 36:54.376
She is unable to think
of anything but her patient.

36:54.412 --> 36:57.438
The atmosphere with
her fiance Koslow is awkward.

36:57.481 --> 37:01.884
He is put off by her
total obsession with Zelig.

37:01.919 --> 37:05.377
Ironically, it is in the noisy,
smoke-filled atmosphere...

37:05.423 --> 37:08.654
of the nightclub
that Eudora Fletcher...

37:08.693 --> 37:11.890
is struck by a brilliant
and innovative plan...

37:11.929 --> 37:14.921
that will create a major
breakthrough in the case.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.908
Dr. Zelig.

37:24.942 --> 37:28.901
I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.

37:28.946 --> 37:30.914
I could certainly try.

37:30.948 --> 37:33.416
Of course,
we can't promise anything.

37:33.451 --> 37:38.912
Last week, I was with a group
of fairly erudite people...

37:38.956 --> 37:41.925
who were discussing
the novel "Moby Dick."

37:41.959 --> 37:46.953
I was afraid to admit
I hadn't read it, so I lied.

37:49.967 --> 37:53.425
I want so badly to be liked...

37:53.471 --> 37:57.464
to be like other people
so I don't stand out.

38:00.911 --> 38:02.879
That's natural.

38:02.913 --> 38:06.405
I go to such extreme
lengths to blend in.

38:09.920 --> 38:15.381
You're a doctor. You should know
how to handle that.

38:15.426 --> 38:18.395
But the truth
of the matter is...

38:18.429 --> 38:21.921
I'm not an actual doctor.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.426
You're not?

38:27.938 --> 38:31.396
I've been pretending
to be a doctor...

38:31.442 --> 38:33.910
to fit in with my friends.

38:33.944 --> 38:35.935
You see, they're doctors.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.441
That's something.

38:43.954 --> 38:47.913
But you're a doctor,
and you can help me.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.926
You have to help me.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.418
I don't feel that well,
actually.

38:53.464 --> 38:57.423
My whole life's just been a lie.

38:57.468 --> 39:01.871
I've been posing
as one thing after another.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.874
You need help, lady.

39:03.908 --> 39:07.366
Last night, I dreamt I was
falling into fire.

39:07.411 --> 39:09.379
What does that mean?

39:09.413 --> 39:11.381
That's terrible.
I don't know.

39:11.415 --> 39:16.182
Doctor, I know
I'm a complicated patient.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.381
- I don't feel that well.
- What am I suffering from?

39:18.422 --> 39:21.391
How should I know?
I'm not a doctor.

39:21.425 --> 39:22.892
You're not?

39:22.927 --> 39:25.896
- No. Am I?
- Who are you?

39:25.930 --> 39:28.899
What do you mean?
These are tough questions.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.400
Leonard Zelig?

39:30.434 --> 39:32.402
Definitely. Who is he?

39:32.436 --> 39:33.903
You.

39:33.938 --> 39:35.906
I'm nobody. I'm nothing.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.931
I... catch me.
I'm falling.

39:39.276 --> 39:41.073
Playing on
Zelig's identity disorder...

39:41.112 --> 39:43.080
Dr. Fletcher
has manipulated him...

39:43.114 --> 39:44.911
into momentary disorientation.

39:44.949 --> 39:49.443
With his guard lowered, she
quickly puts him under hypnosis.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.385
Using posthypnotic suggestion...

39:51.422 --> 39:54.858
she will now be able
to induce a trance at will.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.884
My brother beat me.

39:57.928 --> 40:01.887
My sister beat my brother.

40:01.932 --> 40:07.393
My father beat my sister
and my brother and me.

40:07.438 --> 40:10.896
My mother beat my father...

40:10.941 --> 40:14.900
and my sister and me
and my brother.

40:14.945 --> 40:17.914
The neighbors beat our family.

40:17.948 --> 40:25.047
People down the block beat
the neighbors and our family.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.922
I'm twelve years old.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.927
I run into a synagogue.

40:30.961 --> 40:35.421
I ask the rabbi
the meaning of life.

40:35.466 --> 40:39.425
He tells me
the meaning of life...

40:39.470 --> 40:42.439
but he tells it to me in Hebrew.

40:42.473 --> 40:45.931
I don't understand Hebrew.

40:45.976 --> 40:50.709
Then he wants to charge me
$600 for Hebrew lessons.

40:50.748 --> 40:55.447
Dr. Fletcher's therapy consists
of a two-pronged attack.

40:55.486 --> 40:59.445
In the trance state,
the personality will be...

40:59.490 --> 41:01.390
deeply probed
and then restructured.

41:01.425 --> 41:03.393
In the conscious state...

41:03.427 --> 41:05.895
she will provide
love and affection...

41:05.930 --> 41:07.921
unconditional positive regard.

41:31.956 --> 41:33.924
You will be completely honest.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.926
You're in a deep trance.

41:35.960 --> 41:40.920
You will become not who you
think I want you to be...

41:40.965 --> 41:42.933
but you will be yourself.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.959
Now, how do you
feel about it here?

41:48.472 --> 41:50.940
It's the worst.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.443
I hate the country.

41:53.477 --> 41:56.935
I hate the grass
and the mosquitos.

41:56.981 --> 41:59.449
And cooking...

41:59.483 --> 42:01.883
your cooking is terrible.

42:01.919 --> 42:03.887
Your pancakes...

42:03.921 --> 42:08.381
I dump them in the garbage
when you're not looking.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.896
And the jokes
you try and tell...

42:12.930 --> 42:17.390
when you think you're amusing
are long and pointless.

42:17.434 --> 42:19.902
There's no end to them.

42:19.937 --> 42:21.905
I see.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.907
And what else?

42:23.941 --> 42:27.934
I want to go to bed with you.

42:30.948 --> 42:33.917
Well, that surprises me.

42:33.951 --> 42:36.920
I didn't think you
liked me very much.

42:36.954 --> 42:38.945
I love you.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.426
You do?

42:43.460 --> 42:45.428
You're very sweet...

42:45.462 --> 42:49.922
because you're not as clever
as you think you are.

42:49.967 --> 42:56.429
You're all mixed up and nervous,
and you're the worst cook.

42:56.473 --> 42:58.941
Those pancakes...

42:58.976 --> 43:01.376
I love you.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.870
I want to take care of you.

43:04.915 --> 43:06.906
No more pancakes.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.223
I started out...

43:17.394 --> 43:20.386
by trying to use Leonard
to make my reputation.

43:20.431 --> 43:24.390
Then I found I had
very strong feelings for him.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.903
I never thought
I was attractive.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.905
I never had a real romance.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.908
Charles Koslow
was the type of man...

43:31.942 --> 43:34.433
my mother felt I should marry.

43:38.782 --> 43:42.411
Feeling more confident
every day with her patient...

43:42.453 --> 43:45.422
Dr. Fletcher takes him
for a cautious outing...

43:45.456 --> 43:49.756
an afternoon at her sister's
house in nearby Teaneck.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.920
Meryl Fletcher
is an aviatrix...

43:51.962 --> 43:53.930
a fine professional pilot.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.933
Eudora Fletcher
is an amateur pilot...

43:56.967 --> 43:59.435
and the afternoon
is spent relaxing...

43:59.470 --> 44:02.337
and retelling
old flying experiences.

44:03.907 --> 44:05.875
As the weeks pass...

44:05.909 --> 44:09.367
Zelig is encouraged
to open up more and more...

44:09.413 --> 44:11.381
to give his own opinions.

44:11.415 --> 44:14.384
What was guarded at first
soon becomes expansive.

44:14.418 --> 44:18.946
I hated my stepmother.
I don't care who knows it.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.425
I love baseball.

44:22.459 --> 44:24.927
It doesn't
have to mean anything.

44:24.962 --> 44:27.453
It's just very beautiful
to watch.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.934
I'm a Democrat.
I always was a Democrat.

44:35.472 --> 44:40.432
Is it OK if I don't agree
with you about that recording?

44:40.477 --> 44:42.445
Of course.

44:42.479 --> 44:46.609
Brahms is just always
too melodramatic for me.

44:46.650 --> 44:49.448
You have to be
your own person...

44:49.486 --> 44:51.954
and make your own
moral choices...

44:51.989 --> 44:54.958
even when they do
require real courage.

44:54.992 --> 44:59.156
Otherwise, you're like
a robot or a lizard.

44:59.196 --> 45:01.892
Are you really going
to marry that lawyer?

45:01.932 --> 45:04.423
I would much rather you didn't.

45:05.936 --> 45:07.403
I don't agree.

45:07.438 --> 45:10.430
I think this guy Mussolini
is a loser.

45:12.443 --> 45:16.209
Are we ever going to make love?

45:16.246 --> 45:17.873
It has been three months...

45:17.915 --> 45:20.884
and the board wishes
to examine the patient.

45:20.918 --> 45:24.877
Dr. Fletcher says Zelig isn't
ready to leave the premises.

45:24.922 --> 45:27.390
The doctors agree
to visit him there.

45:27.424 --> 45:30.393
The date is set...
four days hence.

45:30.427 --> 45:32.395
If progress is insufficient...

45:32.429 --> 45:34.420
she will be removed
from the case.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.958
I was very nervous
because in his waking state...

45:40.003 --> 45:42.972
he never remembered anything
from his trance state...

45:43.006 --> 45:45.474
and I wondered
if there could be some way...

45:45.509 --> 45:47.977
of locking
these two things together.

45:48.011 --> 45:50.479
And then I also was worried...

45:50.514 --> 45:53.483
that if he was
with strong personalities...

45:53.517 --> 45:55.712
he might lose his personality.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.051
Sunday at noon,
the doctors arrive.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.556
They are greeted
by Eudora Fletcher...

46:00.591 --> 46:04.550
and Leonard Zelig and are shown
around the grounds.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.564
Though Dr. Fletcher
is tense and alert...

46:07.598 --> 46:10.567
Leonard Zelig seems calm
and at ease.

46:10.601 --> 46:14.059
Despite the fact that he
is surrounded by physicians...

46:14.104 --> 46:16.572
he does not turn into one.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.576
The encounter appears to be
a resounding success...

46:19.610 --> 46:22.078
when Dr. Henry Mayerson
comments innocently...

46:22.112 --> 46:26.071
about the weather,
saying that it is a nice day.

46:26.116 --> 46:29.574
Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson
that he does not agree...

46:29.620 --> 46:32.088
that it is a nice day.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.090
Dr. Mayerson is taken aback...

46:34.124 --> 46:36.524
at the firmness
of Zelig's conviction.

46:36.560 --> 46:41.520
He points out that the sun
is shining and that it is mild.

46:41.565 --> 46:45.023
Zelig, trained to voice his own
personal opinions fearlessly...

46:45.068 --> 46:47.036
is too aggressive.

46:47.070 --> 46:51.029
He has been molded too far
in the other direction.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.042
He has become
over-opinionated...

46:53.076 --> 46:57.012
and cannot brook any
disagreement with his own views.

46:57.047 --> 47:00.574
I'd taken him too far
in the other direction.

47:00.617 --> 47:03.586
He struck Dr. Mayerson
and several board members...

47:03.620 --> 47:05.087
with a rake.

47:05.122 --> 47:07.090
This wasn't what we wanted...

47:07.124 --> 47:09.490
yet I felt I'd
accomplished something.

47:09.526 --> 47:12.552
If I could have him
two more weeks...

47:12.596 --> 47:15.064
I could do some fine-tuning...

47:15.098 --> 47:18.192
and turn Leonard Zelig
back into his own man.

47:28.679 --> 47:32.046
Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher,
the hero...

47:32.082 --> 47:34.050
or should we say, heroine...
of the hour.

47:34.084 --> 47:36.484
The beautiful and brilliant
young psychiatrist...

47:36.520 --> 47:38.988
never lost faith
in her conviction...

47:39.022 --> 47:40.990
that Leonard Zelig,
the human chameleon...

47:41.024 --> 47:42.992
was suffering
from a mental disorder.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.459
Working with her cousin...

47:44.494 --> 47:47.088
cameraman Paul Deghuee,
the doctor managed...

47:47.130 --> 47:49.098
to keep a vital record
of the proceedings...

47:49.132 --> 47:52.499
including rare footage
of Zelig hypnotized.

47:52.536 --> 47:55.562
The patient and healer
have become fast friends...

47:55.606 --> 47:57.574
and enjoy
one another's company...

47:57.608 --> 48:00.577
even when she's
not working on him.

48:00.611 --> 48:03.580
The result of maintaining
a minority opinion...

48:03.614 --> 48:05.707
is a resounding success
for psychiatry.

48:05.749 --> 48:08.912
Who says women
are just good for sewing?

48:08.952 --> 48:10.351
Now it's on to City Hall...

48:10.387 --> 48:12.355
where the town's
newest celebrities...

48:12.389 --> 48:14.084
are given the key to the city.

48:14.124 --> 48:16.024
We're honored to present...

48:16.059 --> 48:18.926
this key
to New York City to you.

48:21.565 --> 48:24.534
Jimmy Walker
did want to be here...

48:24.568 --> 48:29.062
and sing "Leonard the Lizard,"
but he was just too busy.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.035
After city hall,
Eudora Fletcher...

48:34.077 --> 48:36.477
the beautiful genius
who cured Zelig...

48:36.513 --> 48:38.481
of his science-defying
condition...

48:38.515 --> 48:42.474
is honored by fellow scientists
at New York's Waldorf-Astoria.

48:42.519 --> 48:45.488
Present are luminaries
from all over the world...

48:45.522 --> 48:48.491
not just in the field
of psychiatry...

48:48.525 --> 48:51.494
but physics, biology,
mathematics, and you name it.

48:51.528 --> 48:54.326
Here she is exchanging theories
with Nils Andersen...

48:54.364 --> 48:56.855
the father
of modern blood disease.

48:56.900 --> 48:59.425
Later in the week,
Dr. Fletcher is again honored...

48:59.469 --> 49:02.438
as she gets to christen
her first ship.

49:02.472 --> 49:05.373
Quite a success story
for a little girl...

49:05.409 --> 49:06.967
from the backwoods.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.415
I'm speaking to you...

49:12.449 --> 49:15.009
from the home of
Mrs. Catherine Fletcher.

49:15.052 --> 49:18.021
She's the mother
of Dr. Eudora Fletcher...

49:18.055 --> 49:21.024
the famous psychiatrist
in the news these days.

49:21.058 --> 49:25.017
I'll be asking Mrs. Fletcher...
to begin with...

49:25.062 --> 49:28.031
to tell us something
about what it's like...

49:28.065 --> 49:31.034
to raise a medical genius.

49:31.068 --> 49:34.037
I might ask you about
the many sacrifices...

49:34.071 --> 49:37.472
You've made to put your daughter
through medical school.

49:37.507 --> 49:39.975
Speak right into
the microphones, please.

49:40.010 --> 49:42.069
Sacrifices, we had none.

49:42.112 --> 49:45.479
John was a stockbroker.
We had plenty of money...

49:45.515 --> 49:47.983
and I came from a wealthy
Philadelphia family.

49:48.018 --> 49:51.818
I'm sure that your daughter
always wanted to be a doctor...

49:51.855 --> 49:53.982
ever since she could remember.

49:54.024 --> 49:55.992
I don't think so.

49:56.026 --> 49:59.484
I always thought she
wanted to be a flier...

49:59.529 --> 50:02.498
like her sister Meryl,
and raise a family...

50:02.532 --> 50:04.500
but she was a very moody child.

50:04.534 --> 50:07.503
But a mother always
dreams for her child...

50:07.537 --> 50:10.005
to have the success
your daughter has.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.508
She was a very difficult girl.

50:12.542 --> 50:14.510
Tell me about your husband.

50:14.544 --> 50:16.011
I understand that he is
a simple businessman.

50:16.046 --> 50:18.014
He must be so thrilled
and pleased...

50:18.048 --> 50:22.007
to have his daughter
achieve such recognition.

50:22.052 --> 50:25.510
John had problems... depression.
He drank.

50:25.555 --> 50:28.524
Well, Mrs. Fletcher,
thank you so much...

50:28.558 --> 50:31.391
for speaking with us today.

50:39.403 --> 50:41.928
Here at San Simeon,
glorious dreamland...

50:41.972 --> 50:44.566
of newspaper mogul
William Randolph Hearst...

50:44.608 --> 50:48.669
celebrities from all walks
of society sun or play.

50:48.712 --> 50:51.613
There's Marie Dressler
with Mr. Hearst.

50:51.648 --> 50:54.617
Always a popular guest
at San Simeon...

50:54.651 --> 50:58.610
Miss Dressler accepts a flower
from an ardent admirer.

50:58.655 --> 51:01.624
Along with her is Marion Davies.

51:01.658 --> 51:05.116
When she works, Miss Davies
is always dead serious...

51:05.162 --> 51:07.630
But here,
at this fabulous playground...

51:07.664 --> 51:10.656
She shows us her fun side.

51:10.700 --> 51:14.261
There she is with
you-know-who... Charlie Chaplin...

51:14.304 --> 51:16.363
always kidding.

51:16.406 --> 51:19.534
Although New York
is 3,000 miles away...

51:19.576 --> 51:23.444
Jimmy Walker appears through
Mr. Hearst's enchanted gateway.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.041
Another New Yorker
is Leonard Zelig...

51:27.084 --> 51:29.052
here shown clowning...

51:29.086 --> 51:31.554
with everybody's
favorite cowboy... Tom Mix.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.556
Won't Tony be jealous?

51:33.590 --> 51:36.320
Tony is Tom's horse...

51:36.359 --> 51:39.294
and we always thought
they went everywhere together.

51:39.329 --> 51:41.593
There's that fellow
Chaplin again...

51:41.631 --> 51:44.191
this time with Adolphe Menjou.

51:44.234 --> 51:48.466
There's Claire Windsor
and Delores del Rio...

51:48.505 --> 51:51.099
and a very charming
Eudora Fletcher...

51:51.141 --> 51:54.110
chatting with Hollywood's
newest dancing sensation...

51:54.144 --> 51:56.112
James Cagney.

51:56.146 --> 51:58.614
And what have we here?

51:58.648 --> 52:01.742
Only a beautiful lady
named Carole Lombard.

52:01.785 --> 52:04.151
There's Dr. Fletcher
and Leonard Zelig...

52:04.187 --> 52:08.647
hitting a few with Bobby Jones
on Mr. Hearst's golf course.

52:08.692 --> 52:12.651
Unless Leonard can go back to
his old chameleon personality...

52:12.696 --> 52:17.656
and turn into a golf pro,
I'd bet my money on Bobby.

52:17.701 --> 52:20.693
But who cares,
if they're having fun?

52:26.009 --> 52:31.072
Do you want to give the kids
of this country some advice?

52:31.114 --> 52:34.572
I sure do.
Kids, you got to be yourself.

52:34.618 --> 52:36.518
Don't act like anybody else...

52:36.553 --> 52:39.454
because you think
they have all the answers.

52:39.489 --> 52:43.585
Be your own man, speak up,
say what's on your mind.

52:43.627 --> 52:46.596
Maybe they can't do that
in foreign countries...

52:46.630 --> 52:48.598
but that's the American way.

52:48.632 --> 52:52.591
I used to be a member
of the reptile family...

52:52.636 --> 52:54.627
but I'm not anymore.

53:39.349 --> 53:42.785
Zelig, no longer a chameleon,
is his own man.

53:42.819 --> 53:46.277
His point of view
on politics, art, and love...

53:46.323 --> 53:49.292
is honest and direct.

53:49.326 --> 53:52.784
Though his taste is described
by many as lowbrow...

53:52.829 --> 53:54.797
it is his own.

53:54.831 --> 53:57.800
He is finally an individual,
a human being.

53:57.834 --> 54:00.803
He no longer gives up
his own identity...

54:00.837 --> 54:04.329
to be a safe part
of his surroundings.

54:04.374 --> 54:06.342
His taste wasn't terrible.

54:06.376 --> 54:09.345
He was a man who preferred
watching baseball...

54:09.379 --> 54:11.347
to reading "Moby Dick"...

54:11.381 --> 54:14.839
and that got him off
on the wrong foot...

54:14.884 --> 54:16.852
or so the legend goes.

54:16.886 --> 54:19.354
It was much more
a matter of symbolism.

54:19.389 --> 54:22.358
To the Marxists
he was one thing.

54:22.392 --> 54:24.860
The Catholic Church
never forgave him...

54:24.894 --> 54:26.361
for the Vatican incident.

54:26.396 --> 54:27.863
The American people...

54:27.897 --> 54:31.355
in the throes of the Depression
as they were...

54:31.401 --> 54:34.370
found in him a symbol
of possibility...

54:34.404 --> 54:36.804
of self-improvement
and self-fulfillment.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.809
And of course,
the Freudians had a ball.

54:39.843 --> 54:43.301
They could interpret him
in any way they pleased.

54:43.346 --> 54:45.314
It was all symbolism...

54:45.348 --> 54:49.409
but no two intellectuals
agreed about what it meant.

54:49.452 --> 54:52.012
I don't know if you can call it
a triumph of psychotherapy.

54:52.055 --> 54:55.024
It's more like a triumph
of aesthetic instincts.

54:55.058 --> 54:57.526
Dr. Fletcher's techniques
didn't owe anything...

54:57.560 --> 55:00.028
to then-current schools
of therapy...

55:00.063 --> 55:03.521
but she sensed what was needed
and provided it.

55:03.566 --> 55:05.534
That was, in its way...

55:05.568 --> 55:07.593
a remarkable
creative accomplishment.

55:07.637 --> 55:10.197
When I think about it,
it seems to me his story...

55:10.240 --> 55:13.698
reflected a lot of the
Jewish experience in America...

55:13.743 --> 55:18.203
the great urge to push in
and to find one's place...

55:18.248 --> 55:21.217
and then to assimilate
into the culture.

55:21.251 --> 55:23.913
He wanted to assimilate
like crazy.

55:31.594 --> 55:34.722
Eudora Fletcher's
life has also changed...

55:34.764 --> 55:36.231
from this experience.

55:36.266 --> 55:39.235
For her, fame and recognition
are empty rewards...

55:39.269 --> 55:42.727
and do not live up
to the adolescent fantasies...

55:42.772 --> 55:45.002
that prompted her ambition.

55:45.041 --> 55:47.976
She and her patient
have fallen in love...

55:48.011 --> 55:50.980
and it is no surprise
when she forsakes...

55:51.014 --> 55:52.982
the upwardly-mobile
attorney Koslow...

55:53.016 --> 55:56.179
and announces wedding plans
with Zelig.

56:50.540 --> 56:54.636
It was wonderful to see
my sister and Leonard together.

56:54.677 --> 56:58.135
She drew strength from him.

56:58.181 --> 57:02.641
And they were so much in love
with each other...

57:02.685 --> 57:07.145
and she looked happier
than she had in years.

57:07.190 --> 57:12.651
I remember they decided
to get married in the spring...

57:12.695 --> 57:16.688
and then, of course,
the roof fell in.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.293
Two weeks before the wedding...

57:20.336 --> 57:23.635
an ex-showgirl
named Lita Fox comes forth...

57:23.673 --> 57:27.131
and claims that
she is married to Zelig.

57:27.177 --> 57:30.635
She also claims
to have had his child.

57:30.680 --> 57:33.672
It is an immediate scandal.

57:36.820 --> 57:38.879
We were married a year ago.

57:38.922 --> 57:43.382
He said he was an actor.
He sounded just like one.

57:43.426 --> 57:45.394
I'm in show business, too.

57:45.428 --> 57:48.397
We drove to Baltimore,
and we were married...

57:48.431 --> 57:51.161
and I have a license
to prove it.

57:51.201 --> 57:54.659
He had married her while under
a different personality.

57:54.704 --> 57:57.172
When she read of the plans...

57:57.207 --> 57:59.175
for his forthcoming wedding
to Eudora Fletcher...

57:59.209 --> 58:02.736
she was mortified and
decided to take legal action.

58:02.779 --> 58:05.680
Zelig says he will
fight it in court...

58:05.715 --> 58:09.981
but public opinion begins
subtly to shift away from him.

58:10.019 --> 58:14.149
Clever attorneys portray
Lita Fox as an abandoned woman.

58:14.190 --> 58:18.627
The child is neglected, poor,
and fatherless.

58:18.661 --> 58:21.596
Zelig has sold his life story
to Hollywood...

58:21.631 --> 58:24.031
for a large sum of money.

58:24.067 --> 58:26.092
When the scandal breaks...

58:26.135 --> 58:28.603
the studio demands
its money back.

58:28.638 --> 58:31.937
Zelig can only return half.
The rest has been spent.

58:31.975 --> 58:35.411
Outraged, the studio gives him
half his life back.

58:35.445 --> 58:37.413
They keep the best moments.

58:37.447 --> 58:41.907
He is left with only his
sleeping hours and mealtimes.

58:41.951 --> 58:46.445
Zelig is shaken by the scandal,
but it is only the beginning.

58:46.489 --> 58:48.480
Now another woman
steps forward.

58:48.525 --> 58:52.655
Helen Gray, a salesgirl
from a Wisconsin gift shop...

58:52.695 --> 58:56.153
claims that Zelig
is the father of her twins.

58:56.199 --> 59:01.159
She tells lawyers that he passed
himself off as a fur trapper.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.672
Zelig has no recollection,
but admits...

59:03.706 --> 59:07.665
it could have happened
during one of his spells.

59:07.710 --> 59:09.837
It's the signal
for the floodgates to open.

59:09.879 --> 59:13.474
He married me
at the First Church of Harlem.

59:13.516 --> 59:16.314
He told me he was the brother
of Duke Ellington.

59:16.352 --> 59:19.844
He was the guy
who smashed my car up.

59:19.889 --> 59:21.857
It was brand-new.

59:21.891 --> 59:24.860
Then he backed up
over my mother's wrist.

59:24.894 --> 59:29.854
She's elderly
and uses her wrist a lot.

59:29.899 --> 59:32.834
He painted my house
a disgusting color.

59:32.869 --> 59:35.337
He said he was a painter.

59:35.371 --> 59:38.101
I couldn't believe the results.

59:38.141 --> 59:40.735
Then he disappeared.

59:40.777 --> 59:42.768
That Zelig
could be responsible...

59:42.812 --> 59:45.781
for the behavior of
each personality he assumed...

59:45.815 --> 59:48.477
means dozens of lawsuits.

59:48.518 --> 59:50.952
He is sued
for bigamy, adultery...

59:50.987 --> 59:53.956
automobile accidents,
plagiarism, household damages...

59:53.990 --> 59:56.618
negligence, property damages...

59:56.659 --> 01:00:00.220
and performing unnecessary
dental extractions.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:03.289
I would like to apologize
to everyone.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:06.302
I'm awfully sorry
for marrying all those women.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:08.304
It just... I don't know.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:11.307
It just seemed
like the thing to do.

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:14.310
To the gentleman
whose appendix I took out...

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.812
I don't know what to say.

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.814
If it's any consolation...

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.316
I may still have it
somewhere around the house.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:25.811
My deepest apology goes to
the Trokman family in Detroit.

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:29.313
I never delivered
a baby before in my life...

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:34.763
and I just thought that
ice tongs was the way to do it.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:38.597
Thriving mercilessly on
loopholes and technicalities...

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:42.264
the American legal profession
has a field day.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.273
Zelig is branded a criminal.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.276
Despite Dr. Fletcher's
insistence that he cannot be...

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.939
held responsible for actions
while in his chameleon state...

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.413
it is no use.

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:56.578
Leonard Zelig sets
a bad moral influence.

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:59.588
America is a moral country.

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:03.422
It's a God-fearing country.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:10.160
We don't condone scandals...
scandals of fraud and polygamy.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:16.934
In keeping with a pure society,
I say, lynch the little Hebe.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.975
Throughout
the humiliating ordeal...

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:24.639
Eudora Fletcher stands by
the man she loves, valiantly.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.649
Privately, she tells friends...

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.652
that she is worried about
Zelig's emotional condition...

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.655
which seems to her
to be deteriorating...

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.022
under the weight
of conservative moral opinion.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:38.960
In public, he tries to keep up
an appearance of composure...

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.895
but it is increasingly
difficult.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:44.024
It is clear that
he is coming apart...

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:47.525
when he and Eudora dine
at a Greek restaurant...

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:52.633
and in the midst of the meal,
Zelig begins to turn Greek.

01:01:57.647 --> 01:02:00.616
He longs desperately
to be liked once again...

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.585
to be accepted, to fit in.

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.884
Public clamor over his morality
reaches a fever pitch...

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.892
and on the eve
of his sentencing...

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.156
Leonard Zelig vanishes.

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.833
This is Chief Inspector
of Police Thomas Dowd...

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:25.432
with a national
broadcasting news break.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.443
Leonard Zelig is missing.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.945
On the eve of his sentencing...

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:33.073
for an assortment
of crimes and misdemeanors...

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.914
ranging from polygamy to fraud,
he has disappeared.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.920
We are searching for clues...

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:40.422
and would appreciate
speaking with anyone...

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:44.256
who might have any information
leading to his apprehension.

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:47.228
My sister was just shattered.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:52.223
She tried to keep up
a calm front...

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.736
but she was just too upset.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.739
And she wasn't a person...

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.742
who usually
displayed emotion easily...

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.267
except where Leonard
was concerned.

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:08.746
Dr. Fletcher and the police
confer daily.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.753
Together they make
public appeals...

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.756
to anyone who might know
of his whereabouts.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.258
Apart from several
crank telephone calls...

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.123
there is little response.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:21.597
Months go by,
and Zelig is not heard from.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.098
Cars are searched.

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:25.930
False leads pour in
from everywhere.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:28.459
His jacket is recovered
in Texas.

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.473
A manhunt in that state
proves futile.

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:34.840
He is reported seen
in Chicago, in California.

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:38.711
This still photo appears
to have a man resembling him...

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:41.239
with a mariachi band in Mexico.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.746
Dr. Fletcher continues
to search for Zelig...

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.759
but hopes fade
with each passing day.

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:54.251
All I could think of
was Leonard...

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:57.266
how much I missed him
and loved him...

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.269
and all the terrific times
we'd spent together.

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:03.966
It was really
a very painful time for me.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:08.500
The year ends,
and Zelig is still missing.

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.315
I just moped around and wept.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:17.319
And one night
after a very bad time...

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.821
my sister Meryl said to me...

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.825
"Come on, let's go out
for dinner or a concert."

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:26.818
I said, "No. I can't do it,"
but she insisted.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:30.196
We went out
and ended up in a movie.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:33.862
We saw "Grand Hotel," and
with it, there was a newsreel.

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:46.738
Adolf Hitler and
the National Socialist Party...

01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:49.751
continue to consolidate gains
in depression-ridden Berlin.

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:52.083
Denouncing
the Treaty of Versailles...

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:55.852
the Nazis make fervent appeals
to German patriotism...

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:59.760
Eudora Fletcher is stunned
by what she sees.

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.763
Amongst the brown shirts...

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:04.766
she spots a figure
who could be Zelig.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.258
Then it made all
the sense in the world...

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:11.273
because although
he wanted to be loved...

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:13.275
craved to be loved...

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:15.777
there was also
something in him...

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:19.907
that desired immersion
in the mass and anonymity.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:23.214
And Fascism offered Zelig
that kind of opportunity...

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:27.712
so that he could make something
anonymous of himself...

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:32.421
by belonging
to this vast movement.

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:35.953
She sails for
Europe the following week.

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.967
Ten days later,
she arrives in Berlin.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:43.461
Germany is a country deep
in the throes of the Depression.

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:47.033
Militarism and unrest
are in the air.

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.601
She searches everywhere
and makes inquiries...

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.135
but it is impossible.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.579
After three weeks...

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.083
the authorities begin
to get suspicious.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.584
They watch her.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:06:00.077
While she is out,
they search her hotel room.

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.056
A fourth week goes by...

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:04.491
and she is about
to give up and go home...

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:08.987
when news of a large rally
at Munich catches her attention.

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.999
It is rumored
that it will be...

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:14.002
the largest gathering to date
of Nazi personnel.

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.334
Eudora Fletcher
is counting on the hope...

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:21.605
that Zelig may attend and that
if she can confront him...

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:26.274
the strong feeling he has always
had for her can be awakened.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:28.806
At first, all appears hopeless.

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.842
The crowd is huge.

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:34.481
It seems impossible to locate
any one particular face.

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:52.274
Then suddenly, a figure flanking
the chancellor...

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.003
catches her attention.

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:58.673
Behind and to the right
of Hitler, she spots Zelig.

01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:02.775
Struggling to make contact,
she manages to catch his eye.

01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:07.312
Like a man emerging
from a dream, Zelig notices her.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:11.816
In a matter of seconds,
everything comes back to him.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.812
It was nothing like
it happened in the movie.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:17.417
When Leonard left the podium,
they didn't know what to think.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.484
We couldn't believe our eyes.

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.496
Hitler's speech was ruined.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:25.330
He wanted to make
a good joke about Poland...

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:29.827
but just then,
Zelig interfered...

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:33.831
and Hitler was extremely upset.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:39.781
The SS wanted to grab Zelig...

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:42.783
but if they would have
grabbed him...

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:45.787
they probably would have
tortured him...

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:48.288
or maybe even shot him.

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:49.791
So in the confusion...

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:53.283
Fletcher and Zelig
got out of the building...

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:55.296
through a side door.

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:58.788
They grabbed a car,
sped away in the car...

01:08:58.834 --> 01:09:01.667
and the SS after them,
shot them.

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.729
In rare
German newsreel footage...

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:07.765
a quick glimpse of the escape
was recorded.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.759
I was flying.
It was wonderful.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:27.261
And then suddenly,
something happened.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.764
I was frightened.
I lost control.

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.765
We went into a dive.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.032
Leonard was so terrified that
he changed his personality...

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:40.029
and before my eyes,
because I was a pilot...

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:42.270
he turned into one, too.

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.075
Zelig takes control
of the airplane.

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:47.082
Acting the role of pilot...

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:49.676
he struggles valiantly
with the aircraft.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:53.745
The Germans, who are stunned,
take a full fifteen minutes...

01:09:53.788 --> 01:09:56.622
before following
in hot pursuit of their quarry.

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:58.752
With Eudora Fletcher
unconscious...

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.763
Zelig, who had never flown
before in his life...

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:04.265
not only escapes
the German pilots...

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.259
but sets a record for flying
nonstop across the Atlantic...

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.794
upside down.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.394
With a storm of cheers
and a blizzard of ticker tape...

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:36.227
New York welcomes back
Eudora Fletcher...

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.893
and Leonard Zelig,
the human chameleon.

01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:42.927
His remarkable feat of aviation
fills the nation with pride...

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:45.600
and earns him
a full presidential pardon.

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.302
Forgiving multitudes
flock to see him...

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:50.278
as he sits by the side
of his plucky bride-to-be.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.371
Their journey of triumph
leads to City Hall.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.383
New York's greatest honor,
the Medal of Valor...

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.386
is bestowed on Zelig
by Carter Dean.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:03.357
You are a great inspiration
to the young of this nation...

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:05.860
who will one day grow up...

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.863
and be great doctors
and great patients.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.873
This was a great thrill.

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:21.876
I'm glad we lived
to see this day.

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:24.879
Right. I've never flown
before in my life...

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:27.882
and it shows exactly
what you can do...

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.907
if you're a total psychotic.

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.157
The thing was paradoxical...

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:40.650
because what enabled him to
perform this astounding feat...

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:44.325
was his ability
to transform himself.

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:49.326
Therefore, his sickness was also
at the root of his salvation...

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:53.330
and I think it's interesting
to view the thing that way.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:59.473
It was his very disorder
that made a hero of him.

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.575
It was really absurd in a way.

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:05.587
I mean, he had
this curious quirk...

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.418
this strange characteristic.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:09.924
And for a time,
everyone loved him...

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:12.426
and then people
stopped loving him.

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:15.430
Then he did this stunt
with the airplane...

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.932
and then everybody
loved him again.

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:20.935
And that was what
the twenties were like.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:24.666
When you think about it,
has America changed so much?

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.675
I don't think so.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:31.339
After untangling
countless legal details...

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.838
Leonard Zelig
and Eudora Fletcher marry.

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:39.115
It is a simple ceremony
captured on home movies.

01:12:57.973 --> 01:13:02.103
"Wanting only to be liked,
he distorted himself...

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.772
"beyond measure,"
wrote Scott Fitzgerald.

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:07.941
"One wonders what would have
happened if at the outset...

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:12.943
"he had had the courage to speak
his mind and not pretend.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:17.084
"In the end, it was, after all,
not the approbation of many...

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:21.961
"but the love of one woman
that changed his life."
