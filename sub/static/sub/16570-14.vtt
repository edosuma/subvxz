WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:04.667
You sure I don't look ridiculous?

00:11.111 --> 00:12.135
You look great.

00:12.312 --> 00:15.645
Besides, you can't be picky if you're gonna
make me do all the shopping.

00:15.815 --> 00:18.477
And Big Bear definitely has cellular service?
You checked?

00:18.651 --> 00:21.119
It's not the tundra, it's two hours away.

00:21.287 --> 00:23.482
With our ski packages,
we're gonna be so busy...

00:23.656 --> 00:26.420
...we might actually forget about work
for a while.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.993
DDA Hobbs, you remember...

00:30.430 --> 00:32.421
...Chief Johnson.
And this is her husband...

00:32.598 --> 00:35.295
...FBI Special Agent Fritz Howard.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.062
Sorry to interrupt.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.208
I just wanted to make sure
you're all set for Monday.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.341
On the Oxy Lab case.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.672
Oxy Lab.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.074
Yes, of course.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.173
All set.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.217
Uh, what time on Monday?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.910
The trial starts at 9 a.m.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.453
Trial.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.113
Right.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.960
So I'll see you in court.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.596
Yes, you will.
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.765
You have no idea
of what she was talking about, do you?

01:13.373 --> 01:14.499
No.

01:17.777 --> 01:20.610
Oxy Lab used to handle
some toxicology tests for the city.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.011
Unfortunately,
the lab was discredited nine months ago.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.451
Okay, I read about that.

01:26.619 --> 01:30.282
And 42 verdicts were overturned,
most of them DUI's.

01:30.457 --> 01:33.051
But one of them was a murder...

01:33.226 --> 01:37.720
...which, for the last several weeks,
has belonged to Major Crimes.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.694
You're kidding me. What murder?

01:44.137 --> 01:48.130
Okay, seven years ago, a woman named
Doris Osgood impersonated a nurse...

01:48.308 --> 01:52.142
...for some rich banker with terminal cancer.
Now, she robbed the guy blind...

01:52.312 --> 01:54.712
...then she killed him
with an overdose of morphine.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.782
Tox results from the guy's blood
were thrown out as evidence...

01:57.951 --> 01:59.612
...when Oxy Lab was discredited.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.714
And this goes to trial on Monday?

02:02.889 --> 02:05.153
When were you planning
on telling me about this?

02:05.325 --> 02:08.384
Chief, I handed the murder
over to Major Crimes a month ago.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.152
To whom?

02:11.564 --> 02:13.464
Chief, I didn't wanna burden you.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.267
It's an old case I worked
with my ex-partner, George Andrews.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.496
Great cop, retired way too young.

02:19.672 --> 02:22.232
Anyway, I'm picking him up
at the train station.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.501
All ready for the trial on Monday,
lieutenant?

02:24.677 --> 02:25.974
A hundred percent.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.343
See, George got this spontaneous
confession from this fake nurse.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.279
I mean, she told him everything.

02:31.451 --> 02:35.182
Including how she overdosed the guy
she was caring for with morphine.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.414
All we have to do
is put George on the stand.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.616
And Doris Osgood will be back in prison
for the rest of her life.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.785
- And we can go to Big Bear.
- Yes, please. Go.

02:43.963 --> 02:48.297
I mean, chief, really.
When have I ever steered you wrong, hm?

02:52.405 --> 02:55.397
I think I should wait
and meet this Detective Andrews.

02:55.575 --> 02:57.543
Just to go over his testimony.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.838
Honey, you and I will go to lunch
and then we'll come back...

03:01.014 --> 03:03.141
...and then we'll drive up to the cabin,
okay?

03:08.688 --> 03:11.213
The guy's death certificate
said natural causes.

03:11.391 --> 03:15.088
And it was only because Osgood
tried to fence that stupid painting...

03:15.261 --> 03:17.627
...that we...
- The Chagall. I know, I remember.

03:17.797 --> 03:21.289
If it hadn't been for that bone-headed move,
George and I might never have...

03:21.467 --> 03:23.298
Found her. I know.

03:23.469 --> 03:24.936
That confession...

03:25.104 --> 03:28.232
...one of the greatest moments
in L.A.P.D. history.

03:28.875 --> 03:33.539
George seduced that Osgood woman
into giving up everything.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.206
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

03:36.749 --> 03:40.845
George Andrews was the best partner
a cop could ask for.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.845
Hands down.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.690
Really?

03:44.991 --> 03:46.891
- Thanks.
- Hey.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.051
Hey,
why don't you come out with us tonight?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.857
We'll have some drinks,
maybe find some ladies.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.727
- That's all right, Casanova. Calm down.
- All right.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.165
You don't wanna go, that's fine.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.601
Ahem, myself, I...

03:59.839 --> 04:02.330
I've been feeling a little lonely lately.

04:02.775 --> 04:07.678
But there is no shortage of women
when George is around.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.775
Guess who, old man.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.519
George, my man, it is...

04:13.686 --> 04:15.620
It's Georgette now.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.197 --> 04:27.564
Do you believe the balls on this guy,
Flynn?

04:29.168 --> 04:32.035
Uh, I don't think...

04:32.205 --> 04:33.229
Oh, it's a joke.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.498
Go ahead...

04:35.742 --> 04:38.267
...tell him it's a joke, George.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.741
It's not a joke.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.212
George.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.806
This, uh...

04:46.252 --> 04:48.618
It's the real me. Finally.

05:03.102 --> 05:04.433
<i>We have a huge problem here.</i>

05:05.204 --> 05:09.038
Yeah, about a size 44D.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.073
Lieutenant Provenza,
how did this happen?

05:11.244 --> 05:14.680
Well, I assume a scalpel was involved.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.610
Chief, in here.

05:16.783 --> 05:20.219
Oh, did everything go okay with
Detective Andrews at the train station?

05:20.386 --> 05:22.786
Well, actually, uh...

05:22.955 --> 05:25.048
...as it turns out, chief...

05:25.224 --> 05:27.522
...he isn't exactly available.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.527
- Well, at least not all of him.
- Shut up, Flynn.

05:31.197 --> 05:36.328
I know that I told you
I would handle everything...

05:39.505 --> 05:41.530
- Is that Detective Andrews?
- It is.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.302
- For heaven's sakes.
- Heaven had nothing to do with this.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.037
Wait a minute.
Is it just the dress or did he...

05:47.213 --> 05:48.805
...you know, go all the way?

05:48.981 --> 05:51.176
Oh, yeah. He's a real lady.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.785
I can't put Detective Andrews
on the stand like that.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.751
Why not?
We need her testimony, not her testicles.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.586
All Osgood's lawyers need to say is if
Andrews was confused about his gender...

06:00.760 --> 06:03.524
...maybe he was also confused
about what Osgood told him.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.555
Hobbs is right. It goes to credibility.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.429
But Detective Andrews
is the only person who can testify...

06:09.602 --> 06:13.094
...to Osgood's spontaneous
and unrecorded confession. Without that...

06:13.272 --> 06:16.901
If we were trying this in Santa Monica,
I'd say roll the dice, but we're not.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.839
We're in the North Valley on this one.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.479
The jury will never see past
Detective Andrews' makeup.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.673
Osgood's son has hired some of the best
defense attorneys around.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.716
You're just gonna let a murderer go free?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.821
I believe the thought was
that we should try to get George...

06:29.989 --> 06:31.854
...to take the stand as a man.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.185
Right. And since this is your case...

06:35.027 --> 06:38.019
You want me to talk Detective Andrews
out of his dress?

06:38.197 --> 06:40.324
I've never even met him... Her.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.764
That's why Lieutenant Provenza
will accompany you.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.903
Buzz, we got any duct tape in here?

06:45.071 --> 06:47.539
Yeah, the second drawer of that cabinet.

06:47.974 --> 06:51.205
The sooner you convince Andrews,
the sooner we head for the hills.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.784
All right, everyone, get busy.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.852
This is not a zoo. I mean it.

07:02.155 --> 07:06.114
Eh, eh. Sanchez, not a word.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.690
Detective Andrews.

07:10.863 --> 07:14.629
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
It is such a pleasure to meet you.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.634
Oh, the pleasure is mine.
I love your parka.

07:18.070 --> 07:21.130
Oh, thank you. It's for skiing.

07:21.707 --> 07:24.267
Anyway, welcome back.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.968
That's nice of you to say.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.478
And I guess I should apologize
for showing up, uh...

07:29.816 --> 07:30.840
...unannounced.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.247
But when this case was overturned...

07:33.419 --> 07:38.914
...I felt it was my duty
to put aside my personal worries.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.059
No apology necessary.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.424
- Why don't you have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.904
Because as you know,
we no longer possess the clinical sample...

07:52.071 --> 07:53.936
...of the morphine used in the murder.

07:54.106 --> 07:57.769
And since you did excellent work
in obtaining that spontaneous confession...

07:57.944 --> 08:02.608
...we also never got any other evidence.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.113
So, um...

08:05.518 --> 08:08.646
There are some concerns
on the part of the DA...

08:08.821 --> 08:11.346
Oh, for God's sake. Here's the deal.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.220
You can't take the stand
looking like that, George.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.759
So strap them down, lose the dress...

08:16.929 --> 08:19.454
...cut the hair. Man up.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.200
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't do that.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.929
You'd rather walk around
waving those fun bags in the air?

08:26.105 --> 08:27.436
- Enough.
- What are you saying?

08:27.607 --> 08:30.872
<i>Let me explain. Please. Thank you.</i>

08:35.648 --> 08:36.672
Detective Andrews...

08:36.849 --> 08:41.183
...DDA Hobbs feels that she cannot
put you on the stand as a woman.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.254
Well, I'm very sorry to hear you say that.

08:46.425 --> 08:51.021
Because I absolutely refuse to participate
in this trial dressed up like a man.

08:51.464 --> 08:55.400
Not only would I be committing perjury,
I'd be lying to myself.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.560
And I've gone to a great deal of trouble
not to do that anymore.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.706
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.103
<i>- So now what?
- The press finds out...</i>

09:03.276 --> 09:06.973
We wait. She's a woman now.
Maybe she'll change her mind.

09:07.146 --> 09:10.673
So enjoy the protests.

09:10.850 --> 09:11.908
Excuse me.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.646
You know, Andrews,
when those doctors cut your balls off...

09:16.822 --> 09:21.054
...you should had them pull the stick
out of your ass at the same time.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.423
You...

09:25.598 --> 09:27.691
...of all people.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.536
What's happening?

09:35.708 --> 09:36.732
What's he doing?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.434
What do you think?
She's crying. You hurt her feelings.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.979
- Feelings?
- Yes, my feelings.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.777
You... You insensitive bastard.

09:46.519 --> 09:51.115
I came here despite enormous fears
because I wanted to do the right thing.

09:51.290 --> 09:55.158
And you've done nothing but insult me
since I stepped off that train.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.489
Well, I'm not going to let you bully me...

09:57.663 --> 10:01.599
...into raising my hand
and swearing that I'm a man.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.693
I won't do it.

10:07.707 --> 10:11.234
- I can't. I can't.
- Aw.

10:12.745 --> 10:16.613
- Of course you can't.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, I...

10:18.684 --> 10:20.652
Great. So now we have no case.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.254
Yeah. And no travel insurance.

10:24.423 --> 10:27.415
<i>- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.</i>

10:30.830 --> 10:31.990
It's okay, sweetheart.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.992
So is Hobbs gonna dismiss the case?

10:37.169 --> 10:39.330
Um, not quite yet.

10:40.873 --> 10:44.331
Provided Lieutenant Provenza treats her
better, Andrews has agreed to stay.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.872
Maybe she can help us find something
other than the spontaneous confession...

10:49.048 --> 10:51.175
...to connect Doris Osgood to the murder.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.284
So you're not going then?

10:53.452 --> 10:54.976
I can't. I'm sorry.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.451
Why don't we reschedule?

10:56.622 --> 10:58.954
No, no, no. It's okay.

10:59.125 --> 11:02.788
I know how much you were looking forward
to us learning how to ski.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.896
Oh, I'm still going.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.261
We already bought the package.

11:07.433 --> 11:11.563
The hotel room,
the lessons, the massages.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.496
It's all been paid for.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.368
Wait, you can't go without me.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.806
Oh, I'll just drop Joel at home
and I'll e-mail you some pictures.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.208
Have a nice murder.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.242
We bought massages?

11:26.018 --> 11:29.920
In the seven weeks
Doris Osgood spent impersonating a nurse...

11:30.089 --> 11:32.785
...in order to care for Charles Billings...

11:32.958 --> 11:36.416
...she forged his signature
on 23 checks...

11:36.595 --> 11:39.189
...and took out seven credit cards
in his name.

11:39.365 --> 11:43.233
In all,
she managed to steal almost $55,000.

11:45.104 --> 11:48.267
Uh, uh... Billings had five grown kids...

11:48.441 --> 11:52.275
...but none of them noticed the theft
because they were ripping him off too.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.209
The old man finally got suspicious.
That's why she killed him.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.908
A few days later,
she tried selling his Chagall...

11:59.085 --> 12:02.486
...but the dealer she took it to
called the police.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.088
We got an autopsy.

12:04.256 --> 12:08.454
Oxy Lab found the excessive dose
of morphine in Billings' system.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.191
- Questions anyone?
- Yes.

12:11.363 --> 12:12.557
Detective Andrews, sir...

12:13.432 --> 12:14.956
Ma'am.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.762
What happened to your penis?

12:18.437 --> 12:22.203
- Sanchez, that is not an appropriate question.
- No, no, it's fine, Chief Johnson.

12:22.374 --> 12:25.537
In fact, I'd like to answer
if it's okay with you.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.671
Interestingly enough, detective...

12:28.848 --> 12:32.113
...I still have a lot of the same equipment
I had prior to the surgery.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.911
It's just been inverted.

12:35.287 --> 12:39.485
And refashioned to look pretty much
like any other woman's sex organs.

12:39.658 --> 12:45.324
In fact, the advances they've made
in vaginoplasty are truly amazing.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.994
Okay, that's very informative.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.397
- Thank you so much.
- One second, chief.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.461
So do you like men or women now?

12:53.639 --> 12:56.107
As a matter of fact, I still like women.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.503
What?

12:58.811 --> 13:00.438
What, you...?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.338
You had a sex change
to become a lesbian?

13:04.517 --> 13:08.476
The change I underwent had nothing to do
with my sexual preference.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.487
It was more about
how I identified with the world...

13:12.091 --> 13:13.183
...personally.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.260
And you weren't bothered
that I was a lesbian when I was a guy.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.588
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.357
Blah, blah, blah "lesbian."

13:21.534 --> 13:24.298
Do you currently have a girlfriend?

13:24.737 --> 13:27.638
Detective Sanchez. Enough.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.567
Detective Andrews...

13:29.742 --> 13:33.200
...Doris Osgood never really was
a registered nurse, is that correct?

13:33.379 --> 13:38.214
Yes, it turns out Osgood stole the identity
of an RN named Jane Wesh...

13:38.384 --> 13:42.184
...and she used her credentials
to land a position at the doctor's office...

13:42.354 --> 13:44.219
...where Charles Billings was a patient.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.156
And when Billings needed home care,
Osgood volunteered.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.386
Wow, she really thought this thing out.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.190
And she was good at it too.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.355
Playing nurse, I mean.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.434
In fact, so good I thought
she may have pulled a scam before...

13:57.603 --> 14:01.232
...but her confession got her life
without parole so we never pursued it.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.171
If we had any priors,
we wouldn't need Osgood's confession.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.573
We have Osgood's confession.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.781
It's because Empty Pants here
won't bite the bullet...

14:09.949 --> 14:12.247
...and put on the clothes
he was born to wear...

14:12.418 --> 14:16.411
...doesn't mean that we can't have
somebody read his testimony in court.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.552
I believe we can only do that
if he isn't available.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.659
He isn't available.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.819
- This is not what we agreed to.
- Lieutenant, that is enough.

14:26.699 --> 14:31.329
Andrews is here on behalf of the L.A.P.D.
and is entitled to a supportive workplace.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.597
I was looking forward to
staying at your house while I was here.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.765
All right, all right. My house, fine. Just...

14:37.943 --> 14:40.503
Just don't cry again.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.442
Please. God, please.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.775
How old is this picture of Doris Osgood?

14:45.951 --> 14:48.749
A few weeks. Lompoc took it
before she was sent back to county.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.684
Is there anything older in her file?

14:50.856 --> 14:54.383
Just an old DMV photo...

14:54.560 --> 14:57.529
...and an old booking photo from 2002.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.459
If Billings wasn't her first victim...

14:59.632 --> 15:02.499
...maybe there are others out there
she murdered the same way.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.967
Get ahold of Ramos and have him
publish these pictures in the paper...

15:06.138 --> 15:08.538
...maybe someone remembers Doris
as a very bad nurse.

15:08.707 --> 15:12.199
Chief, might I suggest that you publish
some additional photos of Osgood?

15:12.645 --> 15:14.772
You never know
how much someone's appearance...

15:14.947 --> 15:17.142
...might have changed over time.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.046
DDA Hobbs mentioned
that Doris Osgood's son...

15:21.220 --> 15:24.553
...was very involved in her defense.
Why don't we invite him to stop by.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.248
Maybe he can help us
find some old pictures of his mom.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.487
Uh, chief, we're the enemy.
Why would Osgood's son want to help us?

15:31.664 --> 15:34.599
Mr. Osgood, we believe that some
mistakes may have been made...

15:34.767 --> 15:38.828
...in the investigation of your mother's case,
even beyond this whole Oxy Lab mess.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.768
Like sending an innocent woman to prison
for the rest of her life?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.408
If that's what happened, sir...

15:43.575 --> 15:47.671
...the last thing the justice system would
want is to put your mother back in jail.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.108
Why should I believe that?

15:49.915 --> 15:52.008
<i>Well, I've been studying
your mother's case.</i>

15:52.184 --> 15:54.152
<i>- And while it's clear to me...
- Have a seat.</i>

15:54.320 --> 15:56.185
<i>- Thank you.
- Your mother forged checks...</i>

15:56.355 --> 15:58.653
...opened credit cards
in Mr. Billings' name...

15:58.824 --> 16:01.520
...tried to fence a Chagall
from his art collection...

16:01.694 --> 16:04.390
...stole the identity of an RN
and impersonated a nurse...

16:04.563 --> 16:06.997
...it doesn't necessarily follow
she murdered the man.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.430
He could as easily
up and died of natural causes.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.625
Okay, now see?

16:10.803 --> 16:14.534
That's what I've been saying to anyone
who would listen for the last seven years.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.370
My mother did nothing but try her very best
to take care of Mr. Billings.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.602
Until she killed him.

16:19.778 --> 16:23.373
Believe me, if she had her choice, Mom
would have been off to nursing school.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.608
So she always wanted to
work in health care?

16:25.784 --> 16:29.220
Oh, yeah. But she gave up on that
to put me through college.

16:29.388 --> 16:32.118
My mom wanted to save lives,
not end them.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.691
That's why I can't stop
till I prove she's innocent.

16:34.860 --> 16:38.853
Why I've hired new lawyers, filed appeals.
It's taken nearly every penny I have.

16:39.031 --> 16:42.296
It's been money well spent, sir,
because she's almost free.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.833
- If it weren't for that confession...
- She didn't confess.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.795
That cop...

16:48.574 --> 16:51.566
...he propositioned my mom,
to put it nicely.

16:52.911 --> 16:55.402
And when she turned him down,
he got so angry, he lied...

16:55.581 --> 16:57.742
...and said she admitted
to murdering Billings.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.182
So was Osgood your type?

17:02.354 --> 17:06.188
Not so much. I've always been
more into blond, bossy gals.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.757
<i>I apologize for that, sir.</i>

17:07.925 --> 17:10.690
The officer who arrested your mom
doesn't work here anymore.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.023
So let's see
if we can set the record straight.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.094
What can I do to help you here?

17:16.268 --> 17:19.328
If we could track back through
your mother's employment history...

17:19.505 --> 17:22.736
...and find that there's no other evidence
of theft or fraud...

17:22.907 --> 17:26.776
...we probably could convince
the district attorney to drop all charges.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.311
Seriously? This could happen?

17:29.481 --> 17:32.473
If we could talk to some people
she worked for prior to Billings.

17:32.651 --> 17:35.347
- If you remember their names.
- I know them all.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.820
- You want her last job to her first?
- That would be wonderful.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.118
She worked at City Mutual Bank
for a while.

17:41.293 --> 17:45.559
<i>And not only did she not steal anything,
Mom was employee of the month...</i>

17:45.731 --> 17:47.221
<i>- ...three times.
- Good for her.</i>

17:48.100 --> 17:49.362
<i>And before that?</i>

17:49.535 --> 17:52.470
<i>She was an assistant manager
at Mondro Tech in the Valley.</i>

17:52.905 --> 17:57.103
<i>She did data entry
for a Beverly Hills law firm, Sustin & Raber.</i>

17:57.276 --> 17:59.403
<i>And she worked
as an assistant administrator...</i>

17:59.578 --> 18:01.603
<i>...at Tech U. for two years.</i>

18:01.780 --> 18:06.444
<i>And before that, she drove
for Goody's Limo Company in the Valley.</i>

18:06.618 --> 18:10.748
<i>And she sold used cars
for Murphy's Pre-Owned Sedans.</i>

18:10.923 --> 18:12.220
<i>That's the thing, you know?</i>

18:12.691 --> 18:14.886
<i>Mom was always searching.</i>

18:15.060 --> 18:17.927
<i>Going from job to job,
taking care of me...</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:21.032
<i>...without ever having time
to really find herself.</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:28.668
- This isn't a story, just a bunch of pictures.
- What do you mean? It's a great story.

18:28.841 --> 18:34.177
Or it will be when your newspaper helps us
identify Doris Osgood's other victims.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.080
If there are other victims.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.376
Mr. Ramos, in the interest of public safety,
your newspaper is...

18:39.551 --> 18:43.681
From the little I understand, Osgood's danger
to the public is speculative at this point.

18:43.856 --> 18:47.690
And if it turns out she isn't guilty,
we could be accused of libel, right?

18:47.860 --> 18:51.523
So if you want the pictures published,
buy an ad.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.187
There's no money for that.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.027
Okay, then you can be really radical...

18:56.201 --> 18:59.068
...and let Miss Andrews
testify as a woman.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.465
Yeah, good, fine. Okay, it's an ad.

19:03.642 --> 19:07.669
Great. I highly recommend the double-page
at the centerfold to grab people's attention.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.542
- Full color, of course.
- Of course. Thanks, Ricardo.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.911
Listen,
I might be able to get you a discount...

19:13.085 --> 19:15.986
...if you let me know who Miss Andrews is.
- Bye-bye.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.520
Yeah.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.095
Brrr.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.782
- Morning, Louie.
- Oh...

20:22.688 --> 20:24.485
Look at that.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.688
I'm surprised Pope sprang for it.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.760
Well, Chief Johnson
gets what she wants.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.592
With a caboose like that,
of course she does.

20:35.133 --> 20:36.623
You think the ad is gonna work?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.466
Who knows?

20:38.637 --> 20:40.696
Of course,
wouldn't have to worry about it...

20:40.872 --> 20:43.306
...if you'd stop screwing around
and do what's right.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.534
Oh, come on. We had an agreement.
You were...

20:45.711 --> 20:48.202
Did you think you could just
sashay off the train...

20:48.380 --> 20:50.405
...and everything would be like old times?

20:50.582 --> 20:52.709
- We're old friends, Louie.
- No.

20:52.884 --> 20:57.082
No, I was friends with a guy named George,
who doesn't exist anymore.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.621
Maybe he never did exist.

21:00.993 --> 21:06.363
Maybe one of the greatest confessions
in the history of the L.A.P.D. never existed.

21:06.531 --> 21:10.490
Nobody else ever heard
Doris Osgood say...

21:10.669 --> 21:12.330
All right, that's really low.

21:12.504 --> 21:15.735
You know I was much too good a cop
to file a false confession.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.438
And yes, I look different.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.478
I'm not a man anymore.
Which means I don't pee standing up.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.781
I wear a dress instead of a suit.
I walk differently.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.978
I've changed how I do a lot of things,
but not what's in my heart.

21:33.659 --> 21:36.025
I've always been your friend, Louie.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.329
You can't turn your back on all the years.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.533
Look at you. You're not even listening.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.433
The second people start talking about
their feelings, you...

21:47.606 --> 21:48.868
No, no, no. Wait.

21:50.375 --> 21:54.368
Wait, we were thinking Doris Osgood
only changed her appearance.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.537
- Right.
- Maybe it was more than that.

21:57.115 --> 22:00.551
Maybe we caught her doing to Billings
what she had done to other people...

22:00.719 --> 22:04.678
...because she not only changed
what she looked like...

22:05.490 --> 22:09.722
...she changed her entire M.O.

22:10.228 --> 22:13.720
Oh. Yes.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.498
We've had four callers
responding to our ad so far.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.431
And each one remembers Doris Osgood...

22:18.603 --> 22:21.663
...providing care to a rich,
old family member as a nurse.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.867
And in each case, the patient
supposedly died of natural causes.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.241
Somehow, she did something
differently with Billings.

22:29.414 --> 22:30.711
That's why we caught her.

22:30.882 --> 22:33.077
Each of them knew Osgood
by a different name.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.718
Names we were able to confirm...

22:34.886 --> 22:37.878
...were actual RN's
working here in Los Angeles County.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.957
So she stole their identities too?
That's exactly the same M.O.

22:41.126 --> 22:45.222
No, it's not. Osgood got the job with
Billings by working at his doctor's office.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.797
Each of the callers said
she was referred to them...

22:47.966 --> 22:51.925
...by an agency that no longer exists,
an RN Home Aid.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.306
See? See? That's what we're saying.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.840
Well, as fascinating as that may be,
lieutenant...

22:58.009 --> 22:59.977
...how would knowing
she changed her M.O...

23:00.145 --> 23:02.477
...get us any closer
to tying her to a murder?

23:02.647 --> 23:04.740
We don't know that yet.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.941
But it's the key. I'm sure.

23:13.358 --> 23:14.689
I got a woman on the phone...

23:14.860 --> 23:18.193
...that says she thinks Osgood
murdered her father in 2001.

23:26.204 --> 23:29.037
Miss Casey, thank you so much
for coming in to visit with us.

23:29.207 --> 23:30.572
I'm Deputy Chief Johnson.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.266
Oh, it's nothing, dear.

23:32.444 --> 23:37.780
Now that I get all my programs recorded,
I don't have to miss anything.

23:37.949 --> 23:39.280
Oh, that's good.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.578
And now,
I'm told that you're here today...

23:41.753 --> 23:44.381
...in response to photographs
that we put in the paper?

23:44.556 --> 23:45.887
Yes, that's right.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.992
I knew that woman was a menace.

23:49.161 --> 23:52.597
And by "that woman"
you mean Mrs. Doris Osgood?

23:52.764 --> 23:55.130
The woman you knew
as Nurse Linda Parker?

23:55.567 --> 23:58.297
Yes, right again.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.570
<i>I remember she had all her paperwork...</i>

24:01.740 --> 24:04.937
<i>...social security number,
a nurse's license...</i>

24:05.110 --> 24:08.511
<i>...and even a referral from the agency.</i>

24:08.680 --> 24:11.478
And that would be RN Home Aid?

24:11.650 --> 24:12.844
You're three for three.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.919
And what led you to use their services?

24:16.087 --> 24:20.786
Oh, I think there was an issue
with one of the other nurses we had hired.

24:20.959 --> 24:25.157
And Daddy's insurance company
recommended that we replace her.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.491
And they gave you
the name of the agency?

24:27.666 --> 24:29.429
That I can't recall.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.894
You said a moment ago
that Doris Osgood was a menace.

24:34.072 --> 24:36.370
Can you tell me
what you mean by that?

24:36.908 --> 24:40.901
A Monet disappeared
from my daddy's art collection...

24:41.079 --> 24:44.378
...the day after
he fell down the stairs and died.

24:44.549 --> 24:48.110
And I suspected
that woman had taken it.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.946
- So, what did you do?
- I contacted the insurance company.

24:53.124 --> 24:56.389
And one of their security people
got the painting back...

24:56.561 --> 24:58.893
...and he put the blame
on one of our gardeners...

24:59.331 --> 25:02.323
<i>...who fled to Mexico to avoid arrest.
- Where are you going?</i>

25:02.501 --> 25:04.935
Gonna talk to the guy
who brought that painting back.

25:05.103 --> 25:08.971
<i>I can't imagine how he got there.
He didn't even have a car.</i>

25:09.140 --> 25:10.232
You wanna come with me?

25:10.408 --> 25:12.239
<i>- Let's go.
- He must have fled on foot.</i>

25:12.410 --> 25:14.401
<i>Some of them do that, you know.</i>

25:14.579 --> 25:16.740
<i>But I never believed...</i>

25:16.915 --> 25:20.078
...that gardener knew
the value of the Monet.

25:20.252 --> 25:24.416
Even though they were water lilies.

25:26.491 --> 25:30.427
You said your father fell down the stairs.
Was there an investigation into his death?

25:30.595 --> 25:33.257
There should have been, don't you think?

25:34.499 --> 25:37.662
My daddy was confined
to a wheelchair for months.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.861
He was so terrified of the steps.

25:40.038 --> 25:44.941
Why he rode himself
to the edge of the stairway, ha...

25:45.110 --> 25:46.668
...I'll never know.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.276
Detective Gabriel,
I want exhumation orders...

25:52.450 --> 25:54.850
...on all the patients we can trace
back to Doris.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.512
- Are we clearing this with Chief Pope?
- I will, just as soon as I'm done.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.123
Mm, nice shoes.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.783
Oh, thank you.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.277
You're familiar with Mr. Casey.

26:22.447 --> 26:25.644
He had several broken bones,
indicative of a bad fall.

26:25.817 --> 26:29.253
Can't say whether he was pushed down
the stairs or slipped on his own.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.821
Next, patient two and three.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.424
Death certificates say
they died of natural causes...

26:34.593 --> 26:36.959
...but frankly,
when you dig up bodies this old...

26:37.128 --> 26:39.653
...you'd be better off
taking them to an archeologist.

26:39.831 --> 26:43.164
Could you do a tox screen
on their bones, just in case?

26:43.935 --> 26:45.402
Could you give me a hand?

26:48.907 --> 26:51.569
Thank you. Moving on.

26:52.243 --> 26:53.835
Patient four.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.310
Death certificate says natural causes,
but...

26:56.481 --> 26:58.608
Detective, could you...

26:59.818 --> 27:01.183
Look there.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.581
Her neck is broken.

27:05.023 --> 27:08.982
Not proof of homicide, but it's hard
to believe she did it on her own.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.821
Wasn't the? Ugh.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.759
- Wasn't the body autopsied?
- No.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.593
None of them were
because they're all old and sick.

27:15.767 --> 27:18.395
And each of the physicians
signed off on cause of death.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.539
- And the last body, doctor?
- Yes.

27:23.675 --> 27:28.009
This poor lady was in a coma
for two weeks prior to her death.

27:28.179 --> 27:33.811
Certificate says natural causes,
but I have my doubts because...

27:34.486 --> 27:36.647
Ew. What is that?

27:37.622 --> 27:39.817
It's the cap to a nasal-spray bottle,
detective.

27:40.492 --> 27:44.292
I'm guessing someone shoved this down this
woman's throat and she choked to death.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.024
I don't see anything natural about that.

27:53.204 --> 27:56.367
- Here you go, chief.
- Oh, thank you.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.742
You exhumed five bodies?

27:58.910 --> 28:01.936
I'm sorry,
but it is crunch time for Doris Osgood...

28:02.113 --> 28:04.547
...and for your information,
three of those bodies...

28:04.716 --> 28:07.412
...appear to have died
under suspicious circumstances.

28:07.585 --> 28:11.544
- You can connect Osgood to those cases?
- Well, we're trying to. Lieutenant Provenza?

28:12.223 --> 28:14.885
Well,
let's start way back at the beginning.

28:15.894 --> 28:19.261
Insurance companies
like to do background checks...

28:19.431 --> 28:23.060
...on anybody who has access
to the valuables of their richest clients.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.566
- Housekeepers, gardeners.
- Or nurses.

28:25.737 --> 28:30.504
Exactly. Now, in each of the cases
of potential murder here...

28:30.675 --> 28:33.303
...all of the families
had different insurance companies.

28:33.478 --> 28:36.914
But each company contracted background
checks to the same security analyst.

28:37.082 --> 28:39.846
And that security analyst's name
is Sam Osgood.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.153
Doris Osgood's son.

28:44.889 --> 28:50.293
We found him because he's the same guy
who returned Miss Casey's stolen Monet.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.327
You think Sam
is his mother's accomplice?

28:52.497 --> 28:55.762
He's the reason the people for whom
she worked never reported anything.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.333
Sam Osgood covered it up.

28:57.502 --> 29:00.266
Except with Billings,
where his mom was flying solo.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.872
And that's the change in Doris' M.O.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.941
She stopped working with her son.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.875
None of which proves murder.

29:08.046 --> 29:11.106
- Chief, I got Doris Osgood in Interview 1.
- Oh, thank you so much.

29:11.282 --> 29:12.442
Whoa. What is she doing here?

29:12.617 --> 29:16.246
We're hoping with a little encouragement,
Mrs. Osgood might confess again.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.787
What kind of encour...?

29:19.390 --> 29:20.857
Wow.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.822
Morning, fellas. Chief Johnson.

29:22.994 --> 29:26.122
Now there's the George that I remember.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.992
And there's the Louie I miss.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.365
Detective Gabriel, if you wouldn't mind.

29:32.537 --> 29:36.405
Let's get ready to bring Mr. Osgood
into the Electronics Room, please.

29:36.574 --> 29:39.975
What exactly makes this different
from taking the stand, detective?

29:40.145 --> 29:42.943
I'm not perjuring myself
in the Interview Room, chief.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.048
It's just a little undercover work.

29:45.216 --> 29:49.585
And what makes you think
that George can get your confession?

29:49.754 --> 29:51.813
Let's call it women's intuition.

29:56.694 --> 29:58.059
Yeah.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.193
<i>Doris, nice to see you again.</i>

30:05.637 --> 30:06.831
Don't even think about it.

30:07.572 --> 30:10.234
You remember Lieutenant Provenza?

30:11.776 --> 30:13.505
Listen...

30:14.112 --> 30:18.776
...what happened seven years ago,
how I led you on, I really do apologize.

30:18.950 --> 30:22.010
I know you're much too smart
to fall for that kind of thing again.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.182
Oh, those eyes.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.788
Just as beautiful as I remember.

30:28.359 --> 30:29.792
And you're still full of crap.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.122
My son said
you didn't work here anymore.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.163
And yet here I am.

30:35.934 --> 30:36.958
How have you been?

30:37.535 --> 30:39.469
Lonely.

30:40.138 --> 30:41.537
Like you care.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.936
These past seven years.
You have no idea.

30:44.375 --> 30:47.811
I do.
You've been imprisoned for a long time.

30:48.246 --> 30:52.580
And people look at you
like you're someone you're not.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.378
You have no opportunity
just to be yourself.

30:55.553 --> 30:59.387
- Doris, I can relate.
- Can we move this along, please?

30:59.557 --> 31:02.993
You can't question me about the
Billings case without my lawyers present.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.755
We wanna talk to you
about an entirely different matter.

31:05.930 --> 31:07.591
- Like what?
- Oh, come on, Doris.

31:07.765 --> 31:09.892
We know that Billings
wasn't your first target.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.092
- I mean...
- Lieutenant.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.703
You'd been running
this nurse scam for years.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.999
Mr. Osgood,
thank you so much for coming in.

31:16.174 --> 31:17.937
We thought you might like to see this.

31:18.109 --> 31:20.771
We've got you nailed
on at least five other incidents.

31:20.945 --> 31:22.173
This is not constructive.

31:22.347 --> 31:23.507
My mother?

31:23.948 --> 31:24.972
Where's her lawyer?

31:25.149 --> 31:28.118
- We know about the art thefts. We do!
- We talked about this.

31:28.286 --> 31:30.686
Have a seat.
We're about to drop the Billings case.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.823
We told your mother
before we read her her rights.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.221
- We know about the identity theft.
- Please.

31:35.393 --> 31:39.352
- I don't know what you're trying to pull here.
- Just a second. Doris, I'm sorry.

31:39.530 --> 31:40.997
Why don't you give us a minute?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.440
He can be a real jerk. I apologize.

31:54.612 --> 31:57.513
That's him.
That's the cop she confessed to last time.

31:57.682 --> 32:00.014
- You said he didn't work here anymore.
- He doesn't.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.846
Doris, you should know
that I actually think...

32:03.021 --> 32:05.512
...that the other five thefts
we've discovered...

32:05.690 --> 32:07.715
...are good news for you
and your lawyers.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.691
Good news? How?

32:10.862 --> 32:12.762
This guy is unbelievable.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.331
She's not gonna fall
for the same lies again.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.524
<i>When you told me...</i>

32:16.701 --> 32:19.169
...that you killed
Charles Billings seven years ago...

32:19.337 --> 32:21.862
...you sold your story like a pro.

32:22.373 --> 32:24.238
But just between you and me...

32:24.409 --> 32:27.071
...I think you were only trying
to protect your son.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.909
<i>- What?
- I know you love Sam.</i>

32:30.081 --> 32:32.549
You think he's been in your corner
for this retrial...

32:32.717 --> 32:34.844
...but when he offered up
the information...

32:35.019 --> 32:38.477
...about all those people that you robbed
while impersonating a nurse?

32:38.656 --> 32:40.920
What? I never...

32:42.260 --> 32:45.320
- Sam wouldn't make up things like that.
- That's a lie. He's lying.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.327
<i>- Your son's trying to bury you.
- Is he?</i>

32:47.498 --> 32:49.398
<i>Make us put you away for good...</i>

32:49.567 --> 32:51.535
...so he can keep all the money.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.195
He got you those jobs,
he picked the art work for you to steal.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.767
Sam fenced it. Isn't that right?

32:59.277 --> 33:04.715
You're a loving, trusting mother,
exploited by a psychotic child...

33:04.882 --> 33:07.510
...who's selling you out for his own gain.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.346
No. No. That can't be true.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.890
Doris, how would I know about all this
if Sam hadn't told me?

33:19.297 --> 33:21.595
I'm truly sorry...

33:22.133 --> 33:26.092
...that I helped put you in prison.
So please, help me set you free.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.571
After all I gave up for him.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.312
When he came up with this plan...

33:44.222 --> 33:45.621
...I knew it was wrong.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.382
<i>- What?
- When he was working...</i>

33:47.558 --> 33:49.492
<i>...for the insurance company?
- Oh, my God.</i>

33:49.660 --> 33:52.595
They'd hire him to do background checks.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.388
I was so proud of him at first.

33:54.565 --> 33:56.499
Background checks? On whom exactly?

33:57.201 --> 33:59.328
Employees of their wealthy clients.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.972
As a security analyst...

34:03.174 --> 34:05.335
...he'd have access to people's homes.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.811
And when he found a rich person...

34:11.983 --> 34:13.848
...who had home care and...

34:14.018 --> 34:15.610
I mean, who else could afford it?

34:16.054 --> 34:19.181
- He'd pretend
that someone on the nursing staff...

34:19.357 --> 34:23.487
...was a security risk and get them fired...

34:24.062 --> 34:28.192
...and then he would refer the family
to this agency that he'd set up.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.697
Which was a sham, correct?

34:29.867 --> 34:31.333
I was the only one there.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.396
And with his position...

34:37.275 --> 34:39.641
...he was able to steal me new identities.

34:42.045 --> 34:44.639
Oh, I didn't wanna do it.

34:44.815 --> 34:45.942
I swear.

34:46.117 --> 34:48.608
But when it started...

34:49.219 --> 34:52.518
...he told me at first that I was just...

34:52.690 --> 34:55.681
...finally gonna get to be a nurse.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.693
My own mother. I can't believe it.

34:58.863 --> 35:01.161
<i>Good. That's so good.</i>

35:05.002 --> 35:08.836
- Just write down what we talked about.
- Okay.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.801
- And we're gonna put an end to this.
- Okay.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.643
You have nothing to hold me on.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.152
Because your mother
thought up the whole thing?

35:25.323 --> 35:28.815
She convinced you to get her jobs
in rich people's homes. Once she was in...

35:28.993 --> 35:32.485
...she stole what she wanted
and demanded that you fence it for her.

35:34.499 --> 35:35.761
- You.
- Hey.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.423
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

35:41.405 --> 35:44.169
You might want to rethink this, sonny.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.478
You know what?

35:56.053 --> 35:59.750
It doesn't make any difference
what any of you believe...

35:59.924 --> 36:03.223
...because we're more than seven years out
on all these crimes.

36:03.394 --> 36:05.123
As a professional security analyst...

36:05.296 --> 36:08.094
...I'm happy to inform you
that the statute of limitations...

36:08.266 --> 36:11.099
...ran out on these so-called thefts
a long time ago.

36:11.269 --> 36:13.533
On the thefts, yes.
But not on the murders.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.899
Murders? What murders?

36:17.208 --> 36:21.110
Hey, Billings?
That's still just his word against hers.

36:21.279 --> 36:23.975
- I wasn't working with...
- She's not talking about Billings.

36:24.148 --> 36:27.481
She's talking about the other people
that died under your mother's care.

36:27.652 --> 36:30.553
They were old. It's called natural causes.

36:30.721 --> 36:32.621
I have evidence to the contrary,
Mr. Osgood.

36:32.790 --> 36:36.385
From what your mother just told us,
it shouldn't be hard to convince a jury...

36:36.561 --> 36:40.053
...that you were responsible
for several other murders also.

36:40.298 --> 36:41.322
Unless...

36:41.499 --> 36:45.162
Unless your mother was the one
who killed those people.

36:46.137 --> 36:48.162
Come on.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.404
What do you want from me?

36:50.575 --> 36:52.839
I can't. She's my mom.

36:53.010 --> 36:56.002
Who just rolled on you.
What are you protecting her for?

36:56.447 --> 36:59.007
It's either you or her.

37:00.818 --> 37:04.254
All right. Detective, would you take
Mr. Osgood downstairs and book him...?

37:04.422 --> 37:06.117
No, wait. Okay.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.848
Okay.

37:12.997 --> 37:15.397
She killed her patients...

37:15.633 --> 37:17.191
...all right?

37:17.568 --> 37:18.762
She killed her patients.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.971
And when she got away with it
the first time...

37:24.609 --> 37:26.474
...it just got easier for her.

37:26.644 --> 37:27.941
Who? Who did she kill?

37:28.112 --> 37:31.047
The ones who got suspicious.
I don't remember their names.

37:32.283 --> 37:35.275
- One she strangled.
- Breaking her neck in the process.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.786
She stuffed something
down the second one's throat.

37:38.956 --> 37:40.548
That would be a nasal-spray cap.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.359
- Pushed the third one down the stairs.
- That would be Ms. Casey's father.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.895
And after his daughter
called me all suspicious...

37:48.065 --> 37:50.033
About the Monet that your mother stole.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.669
Which I had to pull back from my fence
and return.

37:52.837 --> 37:56.739
- I realized that she'd gone too far.

37:58.309 --> 38:00.470
I wanted out. I...

38:00.645 --> 38:02.579
I told her to stop.

38:04.181 --> 38:07.378
But she couldn't.
So she went on without me.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.146
And just like I thought...

38:10.321 --> 38:13.882
...she got caught
after murdering that poor Mr. Billings.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.923
Oh, my God.

38:21.532 --> 38:24.933
Very good, Mr. Osgood.
I know how difficult that must have been.

38:29.340 --> 38:32.002
Would you please take Mr. Osgood
downstairs and book him...

38:32.176 --> 38:35.509
What? Book me?
You can't hold me on those thefts.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.774
- But they'll come up at your murder trial.
- That was my mother.

38:38.949 --> 38:41.383
And you were her partner
and aware of her actions.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.110
But I didn't kill them myself.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.454
Well, Mr. Osgood,
as one professional to another...

38:46.624 --> 38:49.718
...I'm happy to inform you
that the law doesn't see it that way.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.418
Detective.

38:55.366 --> 38:59.234
Now, gentlemen, would you please do the
honors and arrest our Florence Nightingale?

38:59.403 --> 39:00.495
Hm.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.805
Ladies first.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.919
Fritzi, hi.

39:20.491 --> 39:21.651
I wish you'd pick up.

39:21.826 --> 39:26.024
I'm grabbing my things and driving up
to Big Bear for the last night.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.859
Fritzi?

39:30.634 --> 39:31.999
Fritzi?

39:32.169 --> 39:33.193
In the bathroom.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.266
What are you doing?

39:40.444 --> 39:44.175
Well, on the chair lift
going up the bunny slope this afternoon...

39:44.348 --> 39:45.975
...I just realized...

39:47.518 --> 39:48.883
...I missed you.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.349
Oh.

39:52.790 --> 39:57.625
The truth is, I don't like traveling anymore
without my wife.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.161
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

40:06.203 --> 40:07.363
Also, on the first run...

40:07.538 --> 40:10.166
...this 12-year-old kid cut me off
and I hurt my knee.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.673
- Aw.
- Now get in here.

40:16.380 --> 40:17.870
Oh, no. Oh, no.

40:18.048 --> 40:19.072
Get in here.

40:26.957 --> 40:28.982
Here's to unmasking the bad guys.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.752
Hear, hear.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.325
Whoo. Whoo-hoo-hoo.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.166
Listen...

40:38.335 --> 40:40.496
...I wanna apologize...

40:41.839 --> 40:45.741
...for being unable to completely...

40:45.910 --> 40:49.971
...come to grips with this thing.
- Louie, I know it's not easy.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.546
It wasn't for me, either.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.881
Hey, I mean, you know...

40:55.052 --> 40:57.850
...if you were 20 years younger,
and I had never met you...

40:59.056 --> 41:00.785
...and if you weren't a lesbian...

41:01.225 --> 41:02.692
You'd be perfect for each other.

41:02.860 --> 41:06.762
Well, I'm not sure
I even have it in me anymore.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.694
Oh, you still have it in you.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.401
- Wow, I mean...
- Huh?

41:14.839 --> 41:16.534
- I mean, wow.
- Oh, I know.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.470
- They're nice, huh?
- Yeah.

41:18.909 --> 41:21.571
Yeah. Flynn, you ought to check these out.

41:21.745 --> 41:23.542
Yeah. No, thanks. I'm good.

41:24.081 --> 41:25.639
I should probably get onboard.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.113
Andy...

41:27.284 --> 41:28.911
...let's not go so long next time.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.553
Louie...

41:32.423 --> 41:33.890
...thanks for everything.

41:34.391 --> 41:37.383
It was a brave thing you did,
coming back...

41:38.896 --> 41:40.523
...Georgette.

41:50.841 --> 41:52.001
It was good for me too.

42:13.631 --> 42:17.795
So you ready to go, Louie?

42:19.069 --> 42:20.468
Call me that just once more...

42:20.905 --> 42:24.773
...and Georgette won't be
my only ex-partner without a penis.
