00:08.132 --> 00:12.929
I don't eat carbs, because
I am carbs. Oops.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.097
That's disgusting. I'm not
eating the spaghetti now.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.225
- Why? What's wrong with it?
- Your hands are dirty.

00:17.226 --> 00:20.186
People do surgery on open
hearts with their bare hands,

00:20.187 --> 00:22.271

I can't touch your pasta?

00:22.272 --> 00:24.232
- They wear gloves.
- No, they don't.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.150
- Yeah, they do.
- You can't put a glove

00:26.151 --> 00:27.610
in an open human body.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.195
Doctors go like "this" with the glove.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.113
And then they go like "this"
when it's time to go in.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.158
No, that's how you lose
a glove inside a body.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.662
Take the glove off, hand it
to your assistant, go in.

00:37.663 --> 00:38.955
There are third world countries

I have to, um...
I'm on a charity bike ride.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.470
I hit a pothole a few miles back,

00:54.471 --> 00:56.180
and it did a number on
my descending colon.

I... I... I don't know.

thing about loving someone is?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.725
When you love somebody, especially
somebody that feeds you

02:08.735 --> 02:11.172
and houses you,
you don't let a homeless man

02:11.173 --> 02:13.341
come in and use
your $8000 Japanese toilet.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.260
Dean, I just want you to know that
I have never used your bathroom,

02:16.261 --> 02:18.054

that your charging port

what is that? Corn chips?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.822

toilet, and I didn't have any rice.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.049

have to enter your password.

Oh. Well, I don't know
any of my passwords,

08:16.037 --> 08:18.247
so just say I forgot,
and get a recovery e-mail.

08:18.248 --> 08:21.375
I'm not touchin' that, and that
is not how crypto works, OK?

08:21.376 --> 08:23.378
No password, no bitcoin.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.630
Uh... um...

08:26.631 --> 08:29.800
Benji, did you, by chance, bring
your grandma's credit card?

08:29.801 --> 08:33.929
If I had my grandma's credit card, I
wouldn't eat at a dump like this.

He taught me about smog checks.

He was not sweet.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.184
He was hostile, he was a dickhead,

10:02.185 --> 10:04.895
and he had this neck sweat
problem, it was disgusting.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.396
Well, he just didn't like you.
He thought we were hooking up.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.858
Oh, that's understandable.
You guys share a toothbrush.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.569
I just realized that I didn't
have my own laptop in 2012,

10:12.570 --> 10:14.488
and I made all those videos on Jason's.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.824
And I wrote the password down
at his apartment

10:16.825 --> 10:19.191
somewhere I knew
he would never throw it away.

On the back of the last photo
he took with his me-maw

10:21.725 --> 10:23.028
the day before she died.

Fortunately, I have this.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.805
It's Jason's favorite t-shirt.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.641
You kept a smelly t-shirt
from six years ago?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.226

We'll reminisce,
talk about the good old days,

10:46.073 --> 10:48.601
and then, when the time is right,
I'll ask for the password.

10:48.612 --> 10:51.020
I don't think he's gonna want
an old, smelly t-shirt back.

10:51.031 --> 10:52.297
I would have a backup plan.

10:52.308 --> 10:54.945
Then I'll just fake a coughing
spasm and ask for a Mountain Dew,

- Fun animal fact:

17:13.241 --> 17:16.534
Flamingos are actually gray
when they're born,

17:16.535 --> 17:20.372
so a baby flamingo is gray, and
then they turn pink eventually

17:20.373 --> 17:22.624
from all the shrimp they eat.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.752
