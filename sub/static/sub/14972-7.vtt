00:00.401 --> 00:03.235
Previously on Van Helsing

00:03.237 --> 00:05.037
( snarling and growling )

00:05.039 --> 00:05.604
( Screams )
Ahhhhh!!!!!

00:05.606 --> 00:06.305
What are they saying?

00:06.307 --> 00:08.374
They are going to execute us.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.275
Holy shit, you made it back.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.276
She needs a doctor now.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.778
It's not healing over.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.029
I sacrificed myself for you.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.279
You lock my people up,
you attack them!

00:15.282 --> 00:16.782
Who's in here?

00:16.784 --> 00:18.617
Who's in here?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.052
It didn't have to be like this,
man, not like this!!

00:20.054 --> 00:21.887
No, it didn't.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.389
You are basically sending us
out there to die.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.624
You mean exactly what you
were about to do to us.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.725
No calli.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.127
Calli!!!!

00:28.129 --> 00:30.162
<i> Make it outside the city,</i>
<i> you might have a chance.</i>

00:41.609 --> 00:44.510
Aren't you curious?

00:51.218 --> 00:54.686
It's for you. Please...

01:15.443 --> 01:18.177
You like?

01:18.179 --> 01:20.212
Oh yes, very much.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.051
So tell me...

01:29.990 --> 01:32.124
What are you and Rebecca doing?

01:35.996 --> 01:39.865
Your laboratory?

01:39.867 --> 01:41.066
Oh yes, of course.

01:44.738 --> 01:48.874
More experiments... children.

01:48.876 --> 01:53.512
I'm very hopeful that a solution
can be found.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.781
Why children?

01:55.783 --> 01:58.217
They are rapidly growing
organisms.

01:58.219 --> 02:02.454
Alive with cellular division.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.958
My serum is absorbed
much faster

02:05.960 --> 02:09.394
than with a fully
grown adult vamp.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.237
One of your species.

02:21.742 --> 02:28.547
I'm told she has a human
companion... a woman.

02:28.549 --> 02:33.051
Yes... sheema.

02:33.053 --> 02:36.388
Treats her like a pet.

02:36.390 --> 02:40.392
Let's her come and go
from the citadel.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.528
I don't know what Rebecca
sees in her.

02:50.271 --> 02:54.339
She killed a group of humans
to rescue her.

02:54.341 --> 02:58.844
Rebels, traitors, all of them.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.113
But not you.

03:01.115 --> 03:02.915
No...

03:02.917 --> 03:07.586
You are a loyal human.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.255
Of course, yes.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.357
Implicitly.

03:15.796 --> 03:19.498
No, no, no, no, no.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.800
You stay.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.674
It's true.

03:28.676 --> 03:33.845
I saw one of ours.

03:33.847 --> 03:38.517
Now one of them... turned.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.119
And the woman?

03:41.121 --> 03:43.522
Julius had her.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.023
She escaped.

03:45.025 --> 03:50.362
Escaped?

03:50.364 --> 03:51.763
I'm disappointed.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.467
It was Julius who failed.

03:55.469 --> 04:00.439
He will try again...
But not for you.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.507
He and the old woman...

04:02.509 --> 04:04.776
They plan to hunt her...

04:04.778 --> 04:07.779
Keep her for themselves.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.315
They dare to defy me?

04:12.987 --> 04:15.787
I made Julius...

04:15.789 --> 04:18.657
I will end him.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.130
He thinks you are weak.

04:25.132 --> 04:31.036
( Laughing )

04:31.038 --> 04:33.805
You go to him.

04:33.807 --> 04:40.312
You tell him... no... no, no,
no... wait.

04:40.314 --> 04:44.349
I will tell him myself.

04:45.886 --> 04:50.255
( Screaming )
Gah!

05:00.234 --> 05:02.668
What's wrong?

05:04.705 --> 05:07.039
Eat!

05:14.315 --> 05:18.950
<i> ( Eating sounds )</i>

05:39.907 --> 05:41.807
<i> Shit.</i>

05:44.645 --> 05:47.312
Over here!

05:50.417 --> 05:55.053
( Growling and snarling )

05:57.091 --> 06:00.559
( Growling and snarling
continues )

06:00.561 --> 06:02.194
No!

06:02.196 --> 06:05.097
( Snarling and grunting )

06:05.099 --> 06:06.965
Get her!

06:08.502 --> 06:12.738
( Growling and snarling )

06:21.281 --> 06:23.081
( Growling )

06:29.289 --> 06:30.021
Hold your advance!

06:32.793 --> 06:34.493
State your business!

06:34.495 --> 06:36.294
Orders from Dmitri.

06:36.296 --> 06:39.831
We want the woman.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.901
Julius' prisoner.

06:42.903 --> 06:43.635
And what...

06:43.637 --> 06:44.703
( Grunting )

06:46.974 --> 06:49.174
Don't let her escape.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.743
<i> No, please stop!</i>

06:51.745 --> 06:53.078
<i> Please, don't hurt me!</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:54.646
<i> Please!</i>

06:54.648 --> 07:00.218
<i> ( Growling )</i>

07:01.889 --> 07:09.361
<i> ( Continues to plea )</i>

07:17.871 --> 07:21.807
( Coughing )

07:51.438 --> 07:52.771
Hey, hey, hey.

07:52.773 --> 07:53.705
Stay with me.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.140
You... you...

07:55.142 --> 07:56.708
What do I do?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.375
What do I do? What do I do?

07:57.377 --> 07:58.944
You can't save me.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.879
Hold on, hold on.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.949
I'm bleeding out.

08:03.951 --> 08:04.950
What are you even doing here?

08:04.952 --> 08:07.686
You're supposed to be at
the hospital.

08:07.688 --> 08:13.058
Axel killed all my friends

08:13.060 --> 08:16.528
and he sent the rest of us
out here to die.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.464
Wait a minute, how... how?

08:19.466 --> 08:21.800
I guess he got his wish.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.301
So what about everyone else?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.637
Kelly? Brendan?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.138
I... I don't know.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.042
We... we got attacked
and Callie...

08:31.044 --> 08:34.145
She let go of my hand
and...

08:34.147 --> 08:35.981
( Sobbing )

08:35.983 --> 08:38.250
I'm sorry.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.418
What about Vanessa,
did she make it back?

08:40.420 --> 08:41.987
Is she safe?

08:41.989 --> 08:45.423
She was bitten.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.659
Hurt... but...

08:47.661 --> 08:49.928
But what?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.364
She...

08:54.234 --> 08:56.434
Catherine?

08:56.436 --> 08:58.036
Hey, hey...

09:29.803 --> 09:32.571
Vanessa...

09:50.857 --> 09:52.824
Hey there, doc.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.962
You're looking at her
blood again?

09:56.964 --> 09:59.197
I never figured her out before.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.200
Maybe I can see something
new this time.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.069
Just an awful lot like them,
huh?

10:04.071 --> 10:07.305
Mmm... similar but different.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.375
She's like a mirror image,
a negative.

10:10.377 --> 10:15.046
Maybe if we can synthesize it...
Undo vampirism forever, but...

10:15.048 --> 10:16.748
I don't know.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.217
So you're starting
to care again?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.653
It's a mystery, that's all.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.655
I mean, would we really want
the world back

10:23.657 --> 10:25.223
the way it used to be?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.491
After everything we've been
through?

10:26.493 --> 10:28.660
Yeah, you wouldn't?

10:28.662 --> 10:31.429
Greed, ignorance...

10:31.431 --> 10:33.832
Who's to say we wouldn't make
all the same mistakes again?

10:33.834 --> 10:37.502
So what, we just hang out here
for as long as we can survive?

10:37.504 --> 10:40.105
That's it, that's all we got?

10:40.107 --> 10:47.278
Maybe... maybe it's all pain,
suffering and loneliness now.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.349
Doc, come on.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.619
We're gonna get out of this.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.322
You and me, I promise you.

11:02.229 --> 11:06.031
I have some samples in
the... centrifuge, I...

11:06.033 --> 11:11.736
I'm going to dim the lights
while she's sleeping ok?

11:19.680 --> 11:20.278
( Grunting )

11:20.280 --> 11:21.946
I got it, I got it.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.698
It's just the damn breaker.

11:23.699 --> 11:25.449
Axel, Axel... this place is
falling apart.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.352
Yeah, given what's happened
this is more of a death trap

11:27.354 --> 11:28.286
than a shelter.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.721
You're right, this place
is going to shit.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.056
We need to do something
about it.

11:31.058 --> 11:34.225
This old girl has been keeping
me alive for three years plus.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.561
She deserves a little respect.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.896
Besides, y'all don't know
what I got up my sleeve.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.297
Yeah, well I for one would
like to know.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.465
Why don't you call a meeting?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.467
I don't want to ruin
the surprise!

11:42.469 --> 11:44.302
And I don't wanna hear
anymore of this about leaving.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.136
This is ten times safer
than anything

11:45.138 --> 11:46.805
we're going to find out there.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.673
End of discussion.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.579
( Groaning )

11:54.581 --> 11:57.482
You're awake again, huh?

11:57.484 --> 11:58.983
Where does it hurt?

11:58.985 --> 12:02.487
God, everywhere!

12:02.489 --> 12:05.056
Mainly my leg.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.258
It burns.

12:09.463 --> 12:14.165
( Coughing )

12:14.167 --> 12:14.866
Oh, Jesus.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.167
You're not healing like usual.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.903
I know.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.338
How's she doing?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.577
That bad, huh?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.145
No, no...

12:27.147 --> 12:29.347
Right doc?

12:34.321 --> 12:36.521
Do you have anything
for the pain?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.957
Yeah.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.676
Thank you.

12:58.678 --> 13:07.719
( Heavy breathing )

13:11.758 --> 13:14.692
Sam! Sam!

13:14.694 --> 13:16.394
We got trouble.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.003
( Growling )

13:32.412 --> 13:33.444
What's happening?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.446
Julius is leading a contingent
up third street.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.114
They're coming
to take you home?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.048
What?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.449
No, you guys don't get it.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.618
He was a top dog, he was
one of Julius' lieutenants.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.453
That's no secret,
everybody knows that.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.055
No, we knew you were
one of them.

13:44.057 --> 13:44.956
We didn't know
you were important.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.958
You people don't get it!

13:46.960 --> 13:49.894
No one's important to Julius
except you.

13:49.896 --> 13:50.795
Hey!

13:50.797 --> 13:53.131
What's everybody standing
around for?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.365
Grab your gear,
it's game time.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.700
What is happening?

13:55.702 --> 13:56.868
As far as I can tell, Julius
is about to tear this place

13:56.870 --> 13:59.704
a new asshole.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.906
Come on, let's go! Move!

14:04.177 --> 14:05.877
They're coming for me.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.212
It looks that way.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.213
How are you feeling?

14:08.215 --> 14:11.182
Weak... like I'm human again.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.186
You're worried about
this attack.

14:17.190 --> 14:17.889
Shit.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.058
Don't write us off just yet.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.059
There's three levels of hell
to get through

14:21.061 --> 14:23.228
before they can get
into this lab.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.963
And what happens when
they get in this lab?

14:24.965 --> 14:28.233
Don't worry about that.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.735
If they get in here...

14:30.737 --> 14:34.505
I'll take you out myself.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.841
You'll take me out?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.043
If it comes to that.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.449
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.786
Yeah.

15:03.536 --> 15:07.939
( Speaking Romanian )

15:17.150 --> 15:20.218
( Speaking serbian )

15:28.828 --> 15:31.496
( Speaking serbian )

15:39.339 --> 15:40.972
( Growling )

15:40.974 --> 15:44.976
( Grunting )

15:44.978 --> 15:47.912

16:00.093 --> 16:10.735
( Small growls )

16:10.737 --> 16:13.905

16:13.907 --> 16:16.407
( Hissing )

16:16.409 --> 16:19.210
( Screeching )

16:19.212 --> 16:20.611
( Screeching and growling )

16:36.563 --> 16:38.162
What are they doing?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.831
They're sacrificing themselves.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.165
Why do they want her so bad?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.166
No, it's not them.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.168
It's the others,
Dmitri and Rebecca.

16:44.170 --> 16:44.669
Who?

16:44.671 --> 16:45.937
The ancients.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.672
They want her, they fear
what she can do.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.674
Oh that's great,
the ancients!

16:49.676 --> 16:51.843
Still feel confident?

16:51.845 --> 16:54.412
What, do I look nervous?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.680
I don't give a shit
who they are.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.582
They're not getting in here.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.585
I'm with Sam.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.620
This is screwed.

17:05.291 --> 17:05.957
Let's go!

17:08.995 --> 17:11.295
( Screeching )

17:17.737 --> 17:18.970
( Screeching )

17:34.087 --> 17:35.053
It's their tactic.

17:35.055 --> 17:35.620
They're gonna throw bodies
at this building

17:35.622 --> 17:36.721
until they get inside.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.189
What do we do?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.558
Fall back to the escalators
and make a stand there.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.297
Get her.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.299
( Screeching and yelling )

17:48.301 --> 17:51.269
( Pounding )

18:09.756 --> 18:10.588
You two go upstairs and help
with the barricade,

18:10.590 --> 18:12.323
I'm going to stay here
with Sam,

18:12.325 --> 18:13.724
set up a perimeter in case
they get past these traps.

18:13.726 --> 18:14.725
No, no, no... Sam
can go with flesh.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.827
I'll stay here with you.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.329
I'll be upstairs.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.331
You stay.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.499
Go on!

18:21.501 --> 18:22.667
You better have a plan
to get us outta here

18:22.669 --> 18:25.303
if things go south.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.104
Yeah, sure.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.950
( Loud banging )

18:40.653 --> 18:42.587
What's happening down there?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.021
I don't know but I'm going
to find out.

18:44.023 --> 18:48.526
Get better, we may need
your help.

18:48.528 --> 18:52.363
Your friend is interesting.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.164
She's been through a lot.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.666
Yeah, haven't we all?

18:55.668 --> 18:59.871
You know, she's one of
the only people...

19:04.477 --> 19:06.644
Vanessa?

19:08.748 --> 19:09.847
Oh no, no, no!

19:09.849 --> 19:12.383
Vanessa? Vanessa!

19:15.054 --> 19:16.020
Shit, come on!

19:16.022 --> 19:18.956
Vanessa, don't die on me.

19:18.958 --> 19:19.690
John?

19:19.692 --> 19:22.026
John, get over here now!

19:22.028 --> 19:22.927
Give me your hand!

19:22.929 --> 19:23.861
What can I do?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.363
I know nothing about this shit.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.531
You can do what I tell
you to do!

19:26.533 --> 19:28.466
Keep the chest compressions
going just like I'm doing.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.200
Like this, here.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.134
I'm gonna go get some meds.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.702
What's happening?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.172
The girl who we thought
couldn't die is dying.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.078
Okay I got it, I got it.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.617
Come on!

19:46.619 --> 19:48.586
This is where we stop them.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.323
Good man.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.827
No way I'm going back to
that vampire hellhole!

20:05.038 --> 20:07.338
Ready to rock.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.739
Alright then.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.108
Game on, soldier boy.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.005
Sweet.

21:18.845 --> 21:23.481
At least the adrenaline started
her heart again.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.483
She has all the signs of sepsis

21:25.485 --> 21:27.551
but her body's not
healing like usual.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.053
There could be something
in the wound

21:29.055 --> 21:30.221
that's causing the toxicity.

21:30.223 --> 21:34.325
Can you fix her?

21:34.327 --> 21:36.560
I've only cut into dead bodies.

21:36.562 --> 21:37.728
What's the difference?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.998
The difference is you can't
screw up with a corpse.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.066
Well does it matter
at this point?

21:42.068 --> 21:43.000
You're confident cutting
into dead people.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.069
Well, she's dead so it's the
same thing.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.570
Either you don't do it and
she's dead

21:46.572 --> 21:48.406
or you do it and screw up
and she's dead.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.674
What have you got to lose?

21:52.278 --> 21:54.145
Yeah.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.080
Alright.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.716
Here... you're assisting me.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.850
What?

22:07.126 --> 22:07.591
Okay...

22:07.593 --> 22:10.094
Here we go...

22:18.638 --> 22:22.039
Oh...

22:27.413 --> 22:30.014
( Roaring )

22:32.618 --> 22:34.085
Shit, here they come.

22:34.087 --> 22:37.254
Yeah, they're gonna be coming
up quick through this kill box.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.322
Hit them them in the head
and hard

22:38.324 --> 22:42.293
in short controlled bursts,
conserve your ammo.

22:42.295 --> 22:43.828
This is it.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.597
This is it.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.569
Now what do we do?

22:51.571 --> 22:56.574
Once I cut into her, I need
you to force the incision open.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.475
Keep it from closing out

22:57.477 --> 22:59.910
so I can get to whatever's
killing her.

22:59.912 --> 23:00.277
Yeah, okay just go.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.846
You ready?

23:01.848 --> 23:04.415
Yeah, whatever.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.784
Ugh... Jesus Christ.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.021
Oh!

23:11.023 --> 23:13.858
Oh god.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.259
( Screeching )

23:15.261 --> 23:17.027
Game on! Here they come!

23:17.029 --> 23:27.037
( Rapid gunfire )

23:27.039 --> 23:37.148
( Rapid gunfire )

23:37.150 --> 23:47.191
( Rapid gunfire )

23:47.193 --> 23:49.794
Everybody pull back, now!

23:49.796 --> 23:50.461
Go!

23:50.463 --> 23:51.262
What are you doing?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.831
Finishing this.

24:07.947 --> 24:13.017
( Explosion )

24:17.857 --> 24:19.423
Oh... Jesus.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.201
( Yelling )

24:30.970 --> 24:32.770
Oh god!

24:34.373 --> 24:40.444
( Explosions )

24:43.883 --> 24:45.416
Did we do it?

24:47.453 --> 24:48.252
Check the roof.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.787
Okay.

25:06.572 --> 25:10.341
( Screaming )

25:10.343 --> 25:15.012
Gustaf... you disappoint me.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.648
We need more warriors.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.955
I'll get more.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.828
( Growling )

25:43.075 --> 25:45.309
They're giving up.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.946
No... regrouping.

25:48.948 --> 25:51.215
This is gonna be a long night.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.132
A vampire tooth.

26:08.134 --> 26:12.202
Must've been what
was poisoning her.

26:12.204 --> 26:16.307
Okay, you can close it up.

26:16.309 --> 26:19.677
I can definitely say I prefer
working on corpses.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.814
Hey.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.015
How's she doing?

26:25.017 --> 26:28.152
Well, you missed all the fun
but I can say she's gonna live.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.155
The question is, will we?

26:31.157 --> 26:33.524
If I have anything to say
about it, we both will.

26:35.461 --> 26:36.994
I'm not convinced.

26:36.996 --> 26:40.831
Hey, doc... I haven't
forgotten what you did.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.900
Trying to save smitty,
saving me...

26:42.902 --> 26:45.903
What happened to you
because of it...

26:45.905 --> 26:49.740
I will make sure you
get through this.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.542
Or I'll die trying.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.659
How long do you think
before they come back at us?

27:08.661 --> 27:09.727
Julius will never give up,

27:09.729 --> 27:13.163
no matter how many warriors he
has to sacrifice.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.366
Why?

27:15.368 --> 27:17.768
Why do you think?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.269
She really means that much
to him?

27:19.271 --> 27:21.538
No, not to him.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.674
Dmitri and Rebecca.

27:23.676 --> 27:26.210
Julius knows they want Vanessa,
it's a play.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.845
For leverage?

27:27.847 --> 27:28.445
Possibly.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.713
For what?

27:29.715 --> 27:30.714
Who knows what vampires plan.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.384
Well you're one of them.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.786
So Dmitri, Julius, Rebecca...

27:35.788 --> 27:37.621
They're all what,
they're all different?

27:37.622 --> 27:39.455
Look... as far as
i understand it

27:39.458 --> 27:41.659
they're, uh, they're older...
They're ancient.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.361
They were around
before all hell broke loose.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.863
You sure know a lot
about how they think,

27:45.865 --> 27:47.531
how they operate.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.265
Well it comes with
the territory.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.901
Hey!

27:53.439 --> 27:55.372
Those are m-4s...

27:55.374 --> 27:57.641
Ar-50s, that's military issue.

27:57.643 --> 27:58.976
Someone's giving someone hell.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.378
That's gotta be the resistance.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.212
No one else has that
many guns.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.648
Those are soldiers,
i promise you.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.384
One and the same.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.054
What's going on?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.389
Firefights out here.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.824
How's Vanessa?

28:13.826 --> 28:17.461
She's doing better, doc says
you're a big reason why.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.962
I just did what she told me to,
but thanks.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.664
It's what saved her.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.499
Yeah well, I'd have done the
same for any of these guys,

28:22.501 --> 28:25.035
I guess... mostly.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.177
Mohamad?

28:33.179 --> 28:35.345
Could be, could be anybody.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.749
It's a warning... there!

28:38.751 --> 28:39.917
They don't look friendly.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.019
Oh god.

28:45.558 --> 28:46.056
Dmitri's death squad.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.025
The elite.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.962
We're dead.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.373
( Gun shot )

29:16.722 --> 29:18.355
Dmitri's death squad.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.158
They outnumber us.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.094
Do we fight?

29:24.096 --> 29:27.798
No... we live to die
another day.

29:30.836 --> 29:35.139
( Grunting )

29:38.744 --> 29:39.710
They're retreating.

29:39.712 --> 29:41.945
Julius knows they can't win
this fight.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.680
So it's a war of the vampires,
huh?

29:43.682 --> 29:45.849
It's been heading this way
for a while.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.618
We could use that.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.354
Get them killing each other,
could buy us some time

29:50.356 --> 29:53.390
for a counterattack of our own.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.458
We'd have to leave
the building for that.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.959
What time do we leave?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.461
No, no, no...

29:57.463 --> 30:02.633
This is still the safest place
we got by a long shot.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.768
You better be right.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.654
What happened?

30:23.656 --> 30:25.656
You died... again.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.591
I brought you back.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.296
I feel sick.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.298
I gave you something to get
you on your feet, fast.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.834
We're not staying long.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.514
Bring the woman to me!

30:50.516 --> 30:57.120
You can stay or leave
but decide now!

31:06.899 --> 31:08.765
So...

31:08.767 --> 31:10.267
They're gonna get in,
we're gonna die.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.202
Not if I have anything to do
with it.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.004
You gonna call their bluff?

31:14.006 --> 31:17.107
I wouldn't mess with them, Axel.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.043
It's Vanessa they want.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.446
Seriously? Just like that?

31:22.448 --> 31:24.548
I'm just saying what
everyone's thinking.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.716
You don't speak for me.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.184
You don't speak for me either!

31:27.186 --> 31:29.620
We don't even know
who you are.

31:29.622 --> 31:30.387
Listen, Vanessa's the only
reason they haven't burnt

31:30.389 --> 31:31.521
this place to the ground.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.489
He's right.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.024
She's the only thing keep us
alive right now.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.058
Vanessa will be fine,

31:35.060 --> 31:36.760
they can't turn and they're not
likely to kill her

31:36.761 --> 31:38.461
if they came all this way.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.230
Maybe that's the answer.

31:42.601 --> 31:43.500
I'm toxic to them.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.802
What if we used my blood
and dispersed it

31:45.804 --> 31:47.537
like a chemical weapon?

31:47.539 --> 31:50.941
Could turn them human...
They'd be easier to kill.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.809
If they're human, why would
we kill them?

31:52.811 --> 31:53.710
There's a point.

31:53.712 --> 31:54.811
Nuh uh.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.546
There's no way I could make
it fast enough.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.883
Plus, I might need all of
her blood to pull it off.

31:59.885 --> 32:01.652
No, there's no way.

32:01.654 --> 32:02.753
Good plan for another time
maybe.

32:02.755 --> 32:05.255
Then we need to start talking
exit strategy, Axel.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.594
Ask me again in an hour.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.832
I guess that means
end of discussion.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.827
You knew this was coming.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.929
You knew this was coming,
it's been three years.

32:45.931 --> 32:50.033
( Muttering )

32:53.806 --> 32:57.507
You're just not gonna let them
in, that's it!

32:57.509 --> 32:59.743
You've got a plan.

32:59.745 --> 33:04.414
You know what you're doing,
you know what you're doing!

33:04.416 --> 33:06.466
They don't get in, that's it.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.517
They just don't get in.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.221
Semper fi, son of a bitch,
semper fi.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.725
Simplify!

33:38.984 --> 33:39.349
Hey.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.451
Hey.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.587
I think Axel may have lost it.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.690
I just saw him talking to
himself in the hallway.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.027
I'm worried that he may have
gone awol... mentally.

33:50.029 --> 33:53.296
He's got no plan to get us
out of this.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.932
Between that and whatever the
vampires have planned for us...

33:55.934 --> 33:57.367
You heard what they said,
we hand over Vanessa,

33:57.368 --> 33:58.801
we all keep our...

33:58.804 --> 34:00.637
Jesus Christ.

34:02.007 --> 34:03.473
What's going on?

34:03.475 --> 34:05.776
Those things come marching
in here in five minutes,

34:05.778 --> 34:07.544
you know Vanessa's the only one
that gets out of here

34:07.546 --> 34:08.378
in one piece, right?

34:08.380 --> 34:09.212
Where's Axel?

34:09.214 --> 34:11.314
Having a breakdown somewhere.

34:11.316 --> 34:12.215
There's no plan to get us
out of here,

34:12.217 --> 34:13.050
he's freakin' delusional.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.551
Look, he spent the last
three years

34:14.553 --> 34:15.552
turning this place
into a fortress...

34:15.554 --> 34:16.653
You don't think he knows
what he's doing?

34:16.655 --> 34:18.055
No.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.256
Not anymore.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.891
Nicole found him talking to
himself like a crazy person!

34:20.893 --> 34:25.295
Everybody talks to themselves.

34:25.297 --> 34:25.729
When was this?

34:25.731 --> 34:28.165
10 minutes ago.

34:33.772 --> 34:34.471
What's going on?

34:34.473 --> 34:37.074
Reality check.

34:37.076 --> 34:38.975
If we're all going to die up
here, we'd like to know.

34:38.977 --> 34:41.478
You still think we're going
to make it through this alive?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.746
Most of us.

34:42.748 --> 34:43.814
We need to know there's
a plan.

34:43.816 --> 34:44.815
Right now.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.083
Well, I got a truck parked
downstairs, John.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.251
I just need to wait for
the valet to bring it around.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.486
I'm serious!

34:49.488 --> 34:51.588
<i> ( Screaming )</i>

34:51.590 --> 34:52.222
Shit, they're in the escalators.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.740
It's too late now.

34:53.741 --> 34:55.257
Yeah, too late for what?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.993
To just hand Vanessa
over to those things?

34:56.995 --> 34:57.994
And then what was gonna
happen Johnny,

34:57.996 --> 34:59.162
in your little mind?

34:59.164 --> 34:59.663
They're just gonna say,
hey thanks guys!

34:59.665 --> 35:01.231
Go ahead!

35:01.233 --> 35:03.166
You know, have a nice day.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.836
There's gotta be another way
out of this death trap.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.270
Nicole!

35:07.272 --> 35:08.171
Let her go, let her go!

35:08.173 --> 35:10.774
Anybody that wants to live,
follow me.

35:10.776 --> 35:11.575
You think you got
a better idea?

35:11.577 --> 35:14.311
You do whatever you want.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.813
What, are we just gonna
leave her here?

35:38.337 --> 35:41.037
Keep advancing.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.280
What do we do now?

35:50.282 --> 35:51.715
Well they still have to make
it through the uv lights

35:51.717 --> 35:53.884
and there's no way
that's gonna happen.

35:53.886 --> 35:54.951
And if they do, then what?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.953
Well, then we say our prayers.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.055
There's only one play left
in the playbook.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.834
Let's barricade these doors!

36:18.443 --> 36:19.676
What are our chances,
Axel?

36:23.448 --> 36:25.382
Axel, John asked you a question.

36:25.384 --> 36:29.553
I don't know!

36:29.555 --> 36:30.353
Better than even.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.155
The lights will cook
any vampire,

36:32.157 --> 36:33.590
we know that.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.102
( Pounding )

36:51.777 --> 36:53.543
Here they come.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.761
What the hell?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.196
What the freak?

37:19.238 --> 37:21.137
( Smashing glass )

37:27.980 --> 37:30.513
( Smashing glass )

37:30.515 --> 37:35.919
Wait... I know him.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.089
( Smashing glass )

37:39.091 --> 37:42.926
That's the guy who killed me.

37:42.928 --> 37:48.031
Oh god,, I must have turned him.

37:48.033 --> 37:48.598
Oh shit, he's human.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.468
Everybody go, now! Run!

37:51.470 --> 37:52.535
Back! Back!

37:52.537 --> 37:54.371
( Smashing glass )

37:54.373 --> 37:56.239
Shit!

38:00.445 --> 38:02.345
Shit!

38:04.182 --> 38:06.182
( Gunfire )

38:10.622 --> 38:11.921
( Gunfire )

38:16.962 --> 38:19.195

38:22.167 --> 38:27.270
Damnit! God damnit.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.509
( Gun fire )

38:40.118 --> 38:41.484
He with them?

38:41.486 --> 38:43.486
Grab your stuff and get
to the inner lab, now!

38:43.488 --> 38:44.888
Axel, what about Nicole?

38:44.890 --> 38:46.156
I can go back for Nicole,
Axel.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.390
Oh really?

38:47.392 --> 38:50.093
What are you going to do, back
through there, through them?

38:50.095 --> 38:51.394
Well, which direction
would you suggest?

38:51.396 --> 38:52.562
This guy, you gotta be
kidding me?

38:52.564 --> 38:54.431
He's going to join forces
with them and help them!

38:54.433 --> 38:54.998
I'm not one of them!

38:55.000 --> 38:55.999
I don't trust this guy.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.000
I'm not one of them!

38:57.002 --> 38:58.251
You keep saying that...

38:58.252 --> 38:59.501
Will you shut up?

38:59.504 --> 39:00.503
The only way we're getting
out of here at this point is

39:00.505 --> 39:02.539
all of us or none of us.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.842
It's time to abandon ship.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.010
Isn't it too late for that?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.278
How the hell are we supposed
to do that four floors up?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.346
Sam, you help Vanessa.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.781
Follow me.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.020
Really?

39:17.022 --> 39:17.787
This is this?

39:17.789 --> 39:20.023
Really.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.291
Go, go, go!

39:21.293 --> 39:23.460
I knew there was a reason
you were protecting this door.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.295
One last surprise.

39:28.667 --> 39:34.137
( Siren wailing )

39:34.139 --> 39:34.804
Where does this go?

39:34.806 --> 39:36.706
Down, it's just down.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.575
Everybody grab a dish bag,
let's go.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.316
Not him.

39:46.318 --> 39:46.716
He stays.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.151
What?

39:48.153 --> 39:49.552
I don't trust him,
i never have.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.453
John, come on.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.722
You're gonna pull this shit
right now?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.224
Ask your friend.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.792
She said he's close
with Julius.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.727
Close to Julius,
that's what she said!

39:57.729 --> 39:58.995
No, I said he was
one of them.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.231
That's... that's all I said.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.031
Come on, this is ridiculous.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.733
Everyone shut up,
just shut up!

40:03.735 --> 40:06.236
We're all so sure of
ourselves, huh?

40:06.238 --> 40:06.770
Sure we have the answers?

40:06.772 --> 40:09.072
We don't know shit.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.174
If you're so goddamn sure
about flesh,

40:11.176 --> 40:13.076
then pull the goddamn
trigger already, John.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.411
Enough bullshit!

40:14.413 --> 40:16.846
Quit talking about it
and pull the trigger!

40:38.870 --> 40:39.903
Good.

40:39.905 --> 40:40.336
I didn't think so!

40:40.338 --> 40:40.904
Good.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.173
Now everybody shut up!

40:43.175 --> 40:46.009
Listen to Axel and get down
the stairs!

40:46.011 --> 40:47.010
You heard the lady, go!

40:47.012 --> 40:48.044
