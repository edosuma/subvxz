A SERIES BASED ON THE BOOK "ANNA"
WRITTEN BY NICCOLÃ’ AMMANITI IN 2015

00:19.560 --> 00:22.440
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
HIT 6 MONTHS AFTER FILMING BEGAN

00:25.120 --> 00:27.360
Tell me about the Outside.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.720
THE WOODS PROTECT US

00:31.680 --> 00:33.720
<i>The Outside's all black.</i>

00:34.800 --> 00:37.320
<i>They're all dead, Astor.</i>

00:41.520 --> 00:46.560
<i>There are no Grown-ups, no kids.
There's nobody left.</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:49.800
<i>You and I are alive
because the woods protect us.</i>

00:51.240 --> 00:55.080
<i>God killed everything,
throwing the Red Fever over the world.</i>

00:55.160 --> 00:57.240
But he didn't kill us?

01:00.360 --> 01:03.640
<i>No, because he can't see
through the woods.</i>

01:05.360 --> 01:08.560
<i>The woods are magical,
you're magical too.</i>

01:09.440 --> 01:13.320
You can go out
because God's afraid of you.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.440
Will you tell me about the holes?

01:21.800 --> 01:25.760
It's full of holes and there are
ghosts,

01:25.840 --> 01:28.240
there's food and other stuff:

01:29.240 --> 01:32.440
cans of tuna, cookies,

01:32.520 --> 01:35.280
beans, toys.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.720
And clothes.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.760
Outside, gigantic birds circle
overhead.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.280
They devour everyone,

01:45.360 --> 01:49.760
they come out of the mountains
and in one go they're by the sea.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.440
I want to go to the Outside too.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.640
<i>You know you can't.</i>

01:58.600 --> 02:01.520
<i>If you go past the rags you'll die.</i>

02:01.600 --> 02:04.280
The air's poisonous for you.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.480
When I die,
the magic will pass on to you

02:09.560 --> 02:13.160
and you can go out
and search for food on your own.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.440
Then I can't wait for you to die.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.360
Come, I'll show you.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.640
Who owns all these toys?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.120
They're yours.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.200
- Who bought them?
- I did. Don't you like them?

05:20.160 --> 05:23.600
This beautiful princess,

05:23.680 --> 05:26.760
where is she hiding?

05:26.840 --> 05:29.800
Where is she hiding?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.800
There's someone under here.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.520
Who's there?

05:39.520 --> 05:41.280
- Who is it?
- Me.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.520
- Hi.
- I came to pick up Anna.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.080
Weren't you coming tomorrow?

05:48.160 --> 05:51.520
Didn't you hear?
There have been infections in Rome, too.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.280
- I didn't know that.
- A family that came from France.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.320
No one knows
how they got across the border.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.840
And so?

06:02.560 --> 06:05.640
Palermo's dangerous, I'm taking her.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.880
- But it's in Rome, not in Palermo.
- Cities are hotspots.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.520
Maria Grazia,
why do you always overreact?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.960
It's a flu that affects
the elderly, not children.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.400
They say they've got a vaccine.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.640
Do you believe everything
they say on TV?

06:20.720 --> 06:23.520
There isn't a vaccine, the virus
mutates.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.680
Did you hear how many died in
Belgium?

06:25.760 --> 06:30.040
If you looked into it properly,
you'd discover the virus is man-made.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.120
Enough with the conspiracy theories
and germ warfare,

06:33.200 --> 06:35.280
I can't handle all this psychosis!

06:35.360 --> 06:37.720
We have to avoid contact.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.520
Palermo isn't safe, Marco,
I'll take her to the countryside.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.160
You should leave too.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.400
People work, you know,
only you do fuck all!

06:46.480 --> 06:49.720
- Come to our place.
- With that guy?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.280
No, thanks.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.640
There's room,
you can bring your tobacco shopgirl.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.440
Want to talk about
that jackass you're with?

06:57.520 --> 07:00.680
Don't start. If you want to see
your daughter, come with us.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.520
- Our daughter.
- Here she is.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.360
- Get ready, we're off to the countryside.
- No!

07:07.560 --> 07:10.800
Anna, get dressed,
Dad'll visit us in the countryside.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.000
Thanks.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.640
I'll visit you this weekend, I
promise.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.360
- Can I take this at least?
- Of course, sweetheart.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.680
- Call me.
- Yeah.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.000
- Are you angry?
- Yes.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.000
Humph, are you always angry?

08:03.160 --> 08:05.480
- Let's play a game.
- No.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.600
- Let's...
- I don't want to!

08:08.680 --> 08:11.160
You're so unpleasant.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.640
Little ants...

11:01.720 --> 11:06.200
with long hair, slippers.

11:07.720 --> 11:12.480
Come to your king,
I'll take you to the toad.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.760
All green and purple.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.720
With spaghetti for hair.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.400
Anna, now I'll bake you a snail
pizza.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.200
Will you help us, please?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.440
Can you get that thing under there?

12:51.480 --> 12:52.880
What is it?

12:54.880 --> 12:57.120
It's ham.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.640
It's pancetta.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.920
It's the same.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.920
- No, you make carbonara pasta with it.
- It's mine!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.360
It's ours, we found it!

13:07.440 --> 13:09.640
It's moldy, can't you see?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.640
No, it's good.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.400
Look what I'll swap you for it.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.360
- Not two, three!
- There are three of us.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.320
- I only have two.
- Not two.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.680
It's your loss.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.040
Wait, I'll take them.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.920
- There are three of you, right?
- Yeah, three.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.440
You can't do much with two,
you said it yourself.

13:40.840 --> 13:45.040
- And the pancetta?
- It's mine, I gave you the fruit juice.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.520
True. And you gave them to me.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.400
We're even.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.440
I didn't understand a thing.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.040
You're Anna, right?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.160
Half the pancetta is mine.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.960
Run!

15:53.040 --> 15:54.680
Come on, it's late.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.880
This one, this one!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.480
This one?

16:04.680 --> 16:06.560
Hi, Astor.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.240
- Here, Anna.
- Hello, sweetheart.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.520
- How did it go?
- Good, he complained a bit.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.760
How unusual, he never complains...

16:17.840 --> 16:20.040
Come on, it's normal.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.600
Hi there, little Anna.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.600
- What's with her?
- She's very angry.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.240
So I see.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.240
- Say hello to your brother Astor.
- He's not my brother!

16:30.360 --> 16:32.440
And he's not my father!

16:32.520 --> 16:35.600
When Daddy comes,
I'm going home with him.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.080
Quit acting like
you're from a broken home.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.440
People fall in love
and then they break-up.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.280
Your father left me
for the tobacco shopgirl, it happens.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.480
You're not going anywhere.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.360
What? She's always sulking,
I've had it with her!

16:50.400 --> 16:53.400
- It's not fair.
- Go to your room, now.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.720
I don't want to see you 'til morning!

16:55.800 --> 16:57.600
I hate you all!

16:57.720 --> 16:59.560
What did you say?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.840
- Up there!
- Get them!

17:54.040 --> 17:55.800
Get him!

18:05.160 --> 18:07.080
C'mon, I'll catch you.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.080
- Where did they go?
- Look for them!

19:37.600 --> 19:39.640
Want some?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.120
No.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.640
The White Kids are older,

19:51.720 --> 19:54.720
they take little kids,
the Blue Kids, to Angelica.

19:56.120 --> 20:00.400
They keep a Grown-up in chains
who can cure the Red Fever with a kiss.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.200
- Do you believe it?
- What?

20:24.120 --> 20:25.800
That they have a living Grown-up.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.400
No, they're all dead.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.360
That's right.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.240
Don't worry,

21:17.200 --> 21:19.560
this will all be over soon.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.040
Are you a priest?

21:23.440 --> 21:24.960
I want to be alone, okay?

24:40.600 --> 24:42.080
And the pancetta?

24:50.160 --> 24:52.320
- Take it all.
- Thanks.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.080
How do you know my name?

25:02.040 --> 25:04.400
- You gave me a kiss.
- When?

25:04.480 --> 25:06.960
- In the Before.
- Me?

25:07.040 --> 25:09.640
A kiss? But I don't even know you.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.200
I'm Pietro.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.240
You want me to give you a ride?

25:17.560 --> 25:19.480
Okay, see you.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.960
Where do you live?

25:26.040 --> 25:28.520
By the lake, among the reeds.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.120
Drop me off here.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.640
It's fine here.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.800
- You sure?
- Yes.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.720
- I can easily give you a ride.
- It's okay.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.040
Will I see you again?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.920
"When...

29:37.000 --> 29:39.200
you find...

29:39.640 --> 29:42.200
jars

29:42.320 --> 29:45.560
or packaged

29:45.640 --> 29:48.840
food,

29:48.920 --> 29:51.320
always read..."

29:52.720 --> 29:56.360
<i>"When you find jars or packaged food,</i>

29:56.760 --> 29:59.040
<i>always read the label</i>

29:59.120 --> 30:02.360
<i>and the expiry date
to understand if you can eat it.</i>

30:05.080 --> 30:07.680
<i>Then smell it carefully.</i>

30:07.760 --> 30:10.680
<i>If you're not sure
whether it's good, boil it."</i>

32:13.280 --> 32:16.360
This is a beautiful house.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.200
There are delicious sandwiches,

32:22.720 --> 32:25.120
a large cupboard

32:26.560 --> 32:29.080
and a drawer

32:29.160 --> 32:32.640
with lots of good things to eat.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.200
Maria Grazia.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.600
It's me, open the door, please.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.440
- What do you want?
- I want to see Anna.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.240
Let me see her, please.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.400
Just for a moment.

34:05.760 --> 34:10.080
Let me in, I just want
to give her a kiss.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.640
If you care about her, go away.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.120
You risk infecting us all.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.640
You want me to die
without seeing her again?

34:23.760 --> 34:25.400
Go away.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.280
I like your shoes.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.680
Yours are nice too.

36:30.760 --> 36:34.440
- Yours are nicer.
- No, yours are.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.600
Yours are made of feet.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.720
Astor.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.160
What is it?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.880
- I'm hungry.
- I'll give you something to eat.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.240
You're always writing,
I'm hungry now.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.760
Just be patient.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.800
Mama?

37:51.120 --> 37:52.360
What?

37:52.440 --> 37:54.200
Are you dying?

38:00.640 --> 38:01.840
Yes.

38:01.920 --> 38:05.720
- And me?
- No, you're not dying, you're little.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.920
Your brother isn't either.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.160
Come.

38:11.760 --> 38:16.160
You have to be good
and look after Astor.

38:18.400 --> 38:21.240
Promise me you'll read the notebook.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.080
Darling.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.840
Will Grown-ups bring medicine?

38:31.160 --> 38:32.640
I don't know.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.560
<i>"Dearest children, soon your mama
will not be here anymore</i>

38:50.640 --> 38:53.120
<i>and you'll have to manage on your
own.</i>

38:53.200 --> 38:56.880
<i>You're good and clever,
I'm sure you can do it.</i>

38:59.080 --> 39:01.600
<i>I'm leaving you a book
of important things.</i>

39:01.680 --> 39:04.680
<i>Inside are directions
that will help you cope with life</i>

39:04.800 --> 39:07.000
<i>and avoid danger.</i>

39:07.080 --> 39:09.000
<i>Look after it carefully.</i>

39:10.280 --> 39:13.520
<i>Anna, you must teach Astor how to
read.</i>

39:16.680 --> 39:21.280
<i>Some of this advice will not be useful
in the world you'll live in,</i>

39:21.400 --> 39:26.000
<i>the rules will change
and I can only imagine them.</i>

39:26.080 --> 39:29.560
<i>You'll be correcting them,
learning from your mistakes.</i>

39:32.320 --> 39:36.280
<i>Mama has gone because of a virus
that's spread around the world.</i>

39:38.120 --> 39:42.600
<i>These are the things I know
and now I'll say them without lies:</i>

39:45.240 --> 39:46.960
<i>everyone has the virus,</i>

39:47.040 --> 39:50.240
<i>in children it's asleep
and does no harm.</i>

39:51.720 --> 39:54.480
<i>It wakes up when you grow up.</i>

39:56.680 --> 39:58.680
<i>The virus doesn't let you have
children.</i>

39:58.760 --> 40:03.960
<i>When your body begins to change,
red blotches will appear on your skin.</i>

40:04.040 --> 40:08.120
<i>Then you cough, it's hard to breathe
and your muscles hurt.</i>

40:10.040 --> 40:11.560
<i>Then you die."</i>

40:29.280 --> 40:30.760
Want to see what I brought you?

40:35.520 --> 40:37.720
These two,

40:37.800 --> 40:39.640
one and two.

40:40.520 --> 40:44.520
I found them in a pit
where there was an evil monster,

40:44.600 --> 40:46.640
