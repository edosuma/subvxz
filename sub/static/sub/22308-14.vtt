(McKenzie)
Previously on <i> Face Off...</i>

00:03.218 --> 00:05.986
All right, Glenn,
who is moving forward?

00:06.021 --> 00:08.087
(Glenn)
Emily.

00:08.122 --> 00:10.524
Darla.

00:10.559 --> 00:11.859
Logan.

00:11.893 --> 00:14.562
[applause]

00:14.596 --> 00:15.796
(McKenzie)
Congratulations.

00:15.831 --> 00:18.098
But your night isn't over yet.

00:18.133 --> 00:20.201
- Oh, no.
- We're raising the bar on you.

00:20.235 --> 00:21.602
Ai-yi-yi.

00:21.636 --> 00:23.571
(Emily) We just went
through hell and back.

00:23.605 --> 00:27.641
What are we doing?
Why are we still onstage?

00:27.676 --> 00:28.943
(McKenzie)
Find out who wins...

00:28.977 --> 00:30.811
- Oh, my God.
- right now.

00:30.846 --> 00:32.213
(Darla)
This is crazy.

00:32.247 --> 00:34.381
(McKenzie) Welcome to
the <i> Face Off</i> finale.

00:34.416 --> 00:36.417
[crowd cheers]

00:40.989 --> 00:45.392
(McKenzie) This season's finale is going
to be the most difficult one yet.

00:45.427 --> 00:46.794
Oh, no.

00:46.828 --> 00:49.430
You guys have these amazing
champions in your corner,

00:49.464 --> 00:51.866
so we're raising the bar on you.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.534
In fact, it is so tough,

00:53.568 --> 00:56.570
that we've brought back
the entire eliminated cast

00:56.605 --> 00:57.571
to help you.

00:57.606 --> 00:59.473
- Seriously?
- What?

00:59.508 --> 01:01.008
Guys, come on out.

01:01.042 --> 01:02.977
- What?
- Jamie.

01:03.011 --> 01:04.845
Jamie.
Can I just go hug?

01:05.847 --> 01:07.581
- That's a trip.
- Oh, my God.

01:07.616 --> 01:08.883
I'm so happy to see Jamie.

01:08.917 --> 01:11.652
I'm so happy to see
everyone onstage.

01:11.686 --> 01:13.053
(McKenzie)
Before I tell you more,

01:13.088 --> 01:15.456
why don't we get you guys
some new teammates.

01:15.490 --> 01:17.057
Darla, you get first pick.

01:17.092 --> 01:19.760
I pick Rob.

01:19.794 --> 01:20.761
Emily, you're next.

01:20.795 --> 01:23.264
Adam.

01:23.298 --> 01:26.901
- Logan.
- Julian.

01:26.935 --> 01:28.636
Anthony.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.538
Jamie, come on down.

01:30.572 --> 01:31.872
Ben.

01:31.907 --> 01:33.674
Stephanie.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.376
Regina.
So cute.

01:35.410 --> 01:36.710
Gregory.

01:36.745 --> 01:37.778
Daniel.

01:37.812 --> 01:40.047
Get over here,
you sculpting wizard.

01:40.081 --> 01:41.649
Kelly, come on.

01:41.683 --> 01:42.650
Well...

01:42.684 --> 01:43.817
[laughter]

01:43.852 --> 01:44.885
Good seeing you, man.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.453
Okay, you have your teams,

01:46.488 --> 01:50.257
and you know the finale
is going to be really tough.

01:50.292 --> 01:52.393
But I didn't tell you why.

01:52.427 --> 01:55.963
It's because each team will be
creating four characters.

01:55.997 --> 01:57.765
Holy shit.

01:57.799 --> 01:59.600
Wow.
Okay.

01:59.634 --> 02:03.370
That is a massive amount of work
to do in a short period of time.

02:03.405 --> 02:05.306
So it might be
a little difficult

02:05.340 --> 02:06.307
to fall asleep tonight.

02:06.341 --> 02:07.675
Okay.

02:07.709 --> 02:09.643
That's all that I'm gonna
give you for now.

02:09.678 --> 02:10.744
No.

02:10.779 --> 02:12.179
That's not enough.

02:12.213 --> 02:14.548
I'll tell you everything else
tomorrow at the lab.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.616
Have a good night.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074

02:30.832 --> 02:34.301
- Hi, Emily.
- Emily, my Em.

02:34.336 --> 02:37.171
Oh, my God.

02:37.205 --> 02:38.339
(Emily)
It's my mom.

02:38.373 --> 02:39.773
I'm used to
talking to her every day.

02:39.808 --> 02:41.609
It's the first time
I've ever been away from her

02:41.643 --> 02:42.610
and my family.

02:42.644 --> 02:44.178
Are you eating well?

02:44.212 --> 02:45.179
Yes.

02:45.213 --> 02:46.847
Are you sleeping well?

02:46.881 --> 02:48.983
Yes, I'm sleeping fine.

02:49.017 --> 02:52.286
This whole competition
just has been about them

02:52.320 --> 02:53.520
and me missing them,

02:53.555 --> 02:54.822
and it's been hard.

02:54.856 --> 02:56.390
It's weird,
'cause I can only see

02:56.424 --> 02:57.391
this much of your face,

02:57.425 --> 02:58.993
but that's okay.

02:59.027 --> 02:59.994
There it is.

03:00.028 --> 03:01.695
[laughter]

03:01.730 --> 03:03.030
(Darla)
It's my boyfriend, Alex.

03:03.064 --> 03:05.332
And I am so excited to see him.

03:05.367 --> 03:06.467
It means the world,

03:06.501 --> 03:09.169
and it gives me that extra push
and motivation.

03:09.204 --> 03:10.804
Oh, my gosh,
it's so great to see you.

03:10.839 --> 03:11.805
I miss you.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.307
I miss you so much,

03:13.341 --> 03:15.242
and I can't wait to see you.

03:15.276 --> 03:16.877
It's not home without you.

03:16.911 --> 03:18.112
Are you leaking?

03:18.146 --> 03:20.814
No.

03:20.849 --> 03:22.616
(Logan) My wife, Sarah,
is there on-screen,

03:22.651 --> 03:24.018
and it's great to see her face.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.452
I love this stuff.

03:25.487 --> 03:26.687
I know it makes you happy.

03:26.721 --> 03:28.322
I am so proud of you.

03:28.356 --> 03:30.691
For you to go this far
is amazing.

03:30.725 --> 03:32.493
I can't wait to see
what you've done.

03:32.527 --> 03:35.496
(Logan) I've got the most incredibly
supportive wife in the world.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.831
And I just want to show her
what I can do.

03:37.866 --> 03:40.267
I miss you so much.

03:40.301 --> 03:41.268
I'll see you real soon.

03:41.302 --> 03:42.703
Just keep doing your thing,
though.

03:42.737 --> 03:43.704
You got this.

03:43.738 --> 03:44.838
Okay.

03:44.873 --> 03:46.306
Bye, baby.

03:46.341 --> 03:47.808
Bye.

03:47.842 --> 03:49.343
All right, I love you guys.

03:49.377 --> 03:51.011
We love you, we love you,
we love you.

03:51.046 --> 03:52.312
All right, bye, guys.

03:52.347 --> 03:55.315
To see them and see how happy
and supportive they are

03:55.350 --> 03:57.251
and how proud they are of me
is just...

03:57.285 --> 04:00.087
it's the extra boost
that I need for this finale.

04:06.394 --> 04:07.361
(Logan)
Ooh.

04:07.395 --> 04:09.763
(Emily)
Oh, my God.

04:09.798 --> 04:10.764
(Logan)
Cool.

04:10.799 --> 04:12.032
(Emily)
So we walk into the lab,

04:12.067 --> 04:14.301
and I notice they
put a red carpet down for me.

04:14.335 --> 04:16.803
And I'm just...
I love it.

04:16.838 --> 04:19.572
Ooh.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.041
(Logan)
Ooh, fancy.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.311
- Oh, God.
- Good morning, everybody.

04:24.345 --> 04:25.446
(all)
Morning.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.314
It's time to end the suspense.

04:27.348 --> 04:28.916
[laughs]

04:28.950 --> 04:32.286
Today's box office is dominated
by blockbuster franchises

04:32.320 --> 04:33.987
that extend well
beyond the screen

04:34.022 --> 04:36.356
into memorabilia,
amusement park rides,

04:36.391 --> 04:37.558
and video games.

04:37.592 --> 04:40.761
But what do the biggest of them
all have in common?

04:40.795 --> 04:43.797
Films like
<i>Star Wars, The Avengers,</i>

04:43.832 --> 04:45.733
and <i> Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

04:45.767 --> 04:48.235
have an incredible team
of characters

04:48.269 --> 04:51.472
who band together
to take on the bad guys,

04:51.506 --> 04:55.209
and that is your
final Spotlight Challenge.

04:55.243 --> 04:57.945
You're going to create a team
of four characters

04:57.979 --> 05:01.014
that could star
in a new film franchise.

05:01.049 --> 05:03.917
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh.

05:03.952 --> 05:05.886
But before you
can create your characters,

05:05.920 --> 05:08.388
your films are gonna
need a genre and a title.

05:08.423 --> 05:09.823
So let's start with the genre.

05:09.858 --> 05:11.024
- Emily.
- Oh, God.

05:11.059 --> 05:12.726
Please choose one
of the three monitors.

05:14.262 --> 05:15.229
- Two.
- All right.

05:15.263 --> 05:16.563
What's behind number two?

05:18.299 --> 05:20.000
Post-apocalyptic.

05:20.034 --> 05:22.202
[laughs]

05:22.237 --> 05:23.203
Logan.

05:23.238 --> 05:25.305
Three.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.406
Sci-fi.

05:26.441 --> 05:27.941
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.009
There you go.

05:29.043 --> 05:30.010
And Darla.

05:30.044 --> 05:31.545
I guess I'll take one.

05:33.114 --> 05:34.381
Fantasy.

05:34.415 --> 05:35.516
Yes.

05:35.550 --> 05:36.550
That's awesome.

05:36.584 --> 05:38.185
Okay, you've got your genres.

05:38.219 --> 05:42.456
Now you'll each be coming up
with your own movie title.

05:42.490 --> 05:44.324
You've got one minute to choose

05:44.359 --> 05:46.360
up to ten words from this board.

05:46.394 --> 05:49.129
Now, you don't have to use
every word that you choose.

05:49.164 --> 05:50.597
But when I call time,

05:50.632 --> 05:53.801
you'll only have five minutes
to come to a consensus

05:53.835 --> 05:56.370
with your teammates
on the new title.

05:56.404 --> 05:58.672
Your minute starts now.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.407
(man)
Paradise, reckoning.

06:00.441 --> 06:01.508
- Destruction.
- Attack.

06:01.543 --> 06:02.609
(man) Warriors. Up, up.

06:02.644 --> 06:03.944
My team's calling out words
at me.

06:03.978 --> 06:05.112
- Fortress.
- Invaders.

06:05.146 --> 06:06.413
Destroyers, attack.

06:06.447 --> 06:08.015
You know, we can be
good guys too.

06:08.049 --> 06:09.016
(man)
Oh, okay.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.017
[laughter]

06:10.051 --> 06:11.585
(Logan)
I grab what I think I need,

06:11.619 --> 06:12.586
but it's frantic.

06:12.620 --> 06:13.821
- Destiny and realm.
- Destiny.

06:13.855 --> 06:14.822
Destiny.

06:14.856 --> 06:15.823
I don't know where it is.

06:15.857 --> 06:17.324
- Emily, grab empire.
- What?

06:17.358 --> 06:18.959
- Empire.
- Ten seconds.

06:18.993 --> 06:19.960
Empire.

06:19.994 --> 06:20.961
Oh!

06:20.995 --> 06:21.962
Five, four, three

06:21.996 --> 06:23.297
(Logan)
Galaxy, where's galaxy?

06:23.331 --> 06:24.565
(man)
It's at the end.

06:24.599 --> 06:26.133
- Time's up.
- Okay.

06:26.167 --> 06:29.136
Oh, my God.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.972
All right, gentlemen,
let's start with...

06:32.006 --> 06:33.073
it doesn't need to be big.

06:33.107 --> 06:34.608
Just take a word.

06:34.642 --> 06:36.710
Nuclear paradise.
Nuclear reckoning.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.712
When I ran up,
this is what I grabbed.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.113
(both)
Ooh.

06:40.148 --> 06:41.682
Cosmos warriors.

06:41.716 --> 06:43.984
Journey to destruction.

06:44.018 --> 06:46.820
Taking.
You said, "Taking Paradise."

06:46.855 --> 06:48.088
Beyond the spirits of Eden,

06:48.122 --> 06:49.656
instead of gates.

06:49.691 --> 06:51.191
There, that's it;
That's our winner.

06:51.226 --> 06:52.559
(McKenzie)
Okay, guys, your time is up.

06:52.594 --> 06:54.061
I need your new film titles.

06:54.095 --> 06:55.095
Darla.

06:57.832 --> 07:00.400
- Ooh.
- The Spirits of Eden.

07:00.435 --> 07:01.835
Nice.

07:01.870 --> 07:03.203
Emily.

07:03.238 --> 07:05.105
Paradise Reckoning.

07:05.139 --> 07:06.273
Okay.

07:06.307 --> 07:08.942
And Logan.

07:08.977 --> 07:09.943
The.

07:09.978 --> 07:11.612
[laughter]

07:11.646 --> 07:12.880
Fortress.

07:12.914 --> 07:14.081
Very cool.

07:14.115 --> 07:16.383
Well, these are
some truly unique titles,

07:16.417 --> 07:19.586
and I can't wait to see
how your characters turn out.

07:19.621 --> 07:21.054
And I know some other people

07:21.089 --> 07:23.156
that are gonna be excited
to see them as well,

07:23.191 --> 07:26.660
the ones who buy the tickets
to these huge blockbusters,

07:26.694 --> 07:28.595
the public.

07:29.597 --> 07:30.564
What?

07:30.598 --> 07:32.633
We have invited people to a VIP,

07:32.667 --> 07:33.734
after-hours experience

07:33.768 --> 07:36.069
where your characters
will be on display

07:36.104 --> 07:39.806
at Universal Studios
Hollywood theme park.

07:39.841 --> 07:41.742
(Darla)
Oh, my God.

07:41.776 --> 07:44.177
Yeah.

07:44.212 --> 07:45.512
What?

07:45.546 --> 07:46.780
They'll check out your work

07:46.814 --> 07:48.382
and vote for their favorite.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.417
And I'll share that result
with the judges

07:50.451 --> 07:53.520
before they choose
this season's winner.

07:53.554 --> 07:54.988
Oh, my God.

07:55.023 --> 07:57.124
(McKenzie) All right, we'll
see you guys in a few days

07:57.158 --> 07:58.158
at Universal Studios.

07:58.192 --> 07:59.192
Good luck.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.697
Let's draw out four silhouettes.

08:03.731 --> 08:05.999
(Gregory) Do we want
to go animal or human?

08:06.034 --> 08:07.134
Good question.

08:07.168 --> 08:09.536
We need to start with
their origination.

08:09.570 --> 08:12.606
(Gregory) What about they were all
science experiments in a lab,

08:12.640 --> 08:14.141
and that's the same fortress.

08:14.175 --> 08:15.409
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:15.443 --> 08:17.010
(Ben) Almost like the
island of Moreau.

08:17.045 --> 08:18.445
(Logan)
I like that a lot.

08:18.479 --> 08:20.580
The backstory is inspired
by <i> The Island of Dr. Moreau.</i>

08:20.615 --> 08:22.849
They'll all be animals
that were tested on

08:22.884 --> 08:24.284
and have evolved into

08:24.319 --> 08:26.086
intelligent versions
of those animals.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.522
I like the idea
of the lizard soldier.

08:28.556 --> 08:29.623
Okay.

08:29.657 --> 08:32.458
The commander is going to be
an iguana

08:32.493 --> 08:34.461
who's a big and imposing leader.

08:34.495 --> 08:36.596
The second character
is going to be an armadillo.

08:36.631 --> 08:38.231
They'll be the weapons expert.

08:38.265 --> 08:41.268
Third, we have the mechanic
of the ship.

08:41.302 --> 08:42.369
What's another animal?

08:42.403 --> 08:46.873
One that doesn't care
for its own hygiene.

08:46.908 --> 08:48.175
Okay.

08:48.209 --> 08:50.610
I decide she's going to be
the mechanic skunk

08:50.645 --> 08:53.113
that needs to quarantine herself
inside a cryo-tube

08:53.147 --> 08:54.548
because she stinks.

08:54.582 --> 08:57.851
And the last character will be
a hammerhead shark assassin.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.753
And that's definitely
what we're gonna do here.

08:59.787 --> 09:00.754
Okay.

09:00.788 --> 09:02.456
So what are you thinking, girl?

09:02.490 --> 09:03.690
All right.

09:03.725 --> 09:05.592
I definitely want to
incorporate the elements.

09:05.626 --> 09:08.428
The idea is that they
can control these elements.

09:08.463 --> 09:12.065
The Spirits of Eden is a movie
about four elemental spirits

09:12.100 --> 09:14.368
who band together
to fight off evil

09:14.402 --> 09:17.004
after Adam and Eve
are cast out of the Garden.

09:17.038 --> 09:18.939
So we have three girls
and one guy.

09:18.973 --> 09:20.007
Yeah.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.742
(Anthony)
For air, like, the satyrs,

09:21.776 --> 09:22.976
which are the ones with, like,

09:23.011 --> 09:24.578
the ram horns and,
like, the bottom half's like

09:24.612 --> 09:25.579
is, like, the hooves.

09:25.613 --> 09:26.580
Right.

09:26.614 --> 09:28.148
They play
that flute-type thing.

09:28.182 --> 09:32.719
The air spirit is part faun
and part woodwind instrument.

09:32.754 --> 09:33.754
It would be interesting
to have...

09:33.788 --> 09:35.322
Merman.

09:35.356 --> 09:36.590
A merman.

09:36.624 --> 09:38.425
'Cause they're gonna expect
a mermaid.

09:38.459 --> 09:39.426
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.627
(Darla)
For the water spirit,

09:40.661 --> 09:42.129
I want to do a merman

09:42.163 --> 09:44.865
and make him
very strong and rugged.

09:44.899 --> 09:46.366
- For the fire one...
- Yes.

09:46.401 --> 09:48.902
I'm wondering if it
would look cool to actually do,

09:48.936 --> 09:50.837
like, sculpted flames.

09:50.872 --> 09:54.474
The fire spirit
has a stone torso

09:54.509 --> 09:56.843
with flames around her face.

09:56.878 --> 09:58.612
The costume would be the tree,

09:58.646 --> 09:59.746
and then the worm...

09:59.781 --> 10:01.314
then you could actually
put her arm in the worm,

10:01.349 --> 10:02.649
and you could actually
do her arm.

10:02.683 --> 10:03.683
Oh, my God.

10:03.718 --> 10:05.585
Our earth spirit
is going to be a worm

10:05.620 --> 10:08.355
wrapped around
a trunk of a tree.

10:08.389 --> 10:11.291
I'm really happy with the way
my team is working together,

10:11.325 --> 10:13.827
and I'm really excited about the
direction that this is headed.

10:13.861 --> 10:16.630
I can incorporate flowers
that she would push out,

10:16.664 --> 10:19.132
and they would grow as the
judges came up and looked at it.

10:19.167 --> 10:22.169
This is why I wanted him.

10:22.203 --> 10:26.206
(Emily) I want to have a metal
one, a glass one, a wood one,

10:26.240 --> 10:27.507
and a leather.

10:27.542 --> 10:28.742
Go, go, go.

10:30.945 --> 10:32.646
Yeah, that one.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.048
Paradise Reckoning
is a post-apocalyptic take

10:35.083 --> 10:36.049
of The Wizard of Oz.

10:36.084 --> 10:37.584
We're gonna need a lot of clay.

10:37.618 --> 10:39.619
After a nuclear disaster,

10:39.654 --> 10:42.322
four characters start mutating
from the radiation

10:42.356 --> 10:47.260
into the elements
that they were injured in.

10:47.295 --> 10:49.663
I'm sculpting
the last character,

10:49.697 --> 10:51.064
who was in a car accident.

10:51.099 --> 10:54.234
He's got shards of glass
embedded into his chest.

10:54.268 --> 10:56.570
Jamie is blocking out
the wood character,

10:56.604 --> 10:58.438
who was in an explosion

10:58.473 --> 11:01.241
where he flew into
a pile of pallets.

11:01.275 --> 11:02.943
Adam's starting to
fabricate the armor

11:02.977 --> 11:04.411
for the metal character,

11:04.445 --> 11:06.780
who is a member
of the bomb squad.

11:06.814 --> 11:10.150
And Regina and Kelly are working
on the leather character.

11:10.184 --> 11:11.651
She is the assassin,

11:11.686 --> 11:14.354
and she's using the leather
to patch and protect herself.

11:14.388 --> 11:16.022
The sculpts that we're
getting done today

11:16.057 --> 11:19.426
cannot be in the mold room
later than two hours.

11:19.460 --> 11:20.560
Yep.

11:23.264 --> 11:24.531
- Hey.
- Hey, Laura.

11:24.565 --> 11:26.099
(Laura) Ooh, already,
you're off and running.

11:26.134 --> 11:27.100
Yep.

11:27.135 --> 11:29.202
- There he is.
- Hey, guys.

11:29.237 --> 11:30.337
Rayce shows up,

11:30.371 --> 11:32.372
and I start filling him in
on my concept.

11:32.406 --> 11:33.540
Yeah, I like it.

11:33.574 --> 11:36.343
And I start sculpting
the hammerhead face.

11:36.377 --> 11:38.545
I put Ben on the skunk face.

11:38.579 --> 11:40.780
I put Gregory
on the armadillo face,

11:40.815 --> 11:42.782
Julian on the lizard face,

11:42.817 --> 11:45.085
and Alan on the lizard cowl.

11:45.119 --> 11:47.687
Today's all about making sure
everybody is on the same page

11:47.722 --> 11:49.489
with what the characters
are supposed to look like.

11:49.524 --> 11:50.891
I want to see the character

11:50.925 --> 11:54.327
that they would sculpt
anatomically first

11:54.362 --> 11:56.329
and replace the flesh
with metal.

11:56.364 --> 11:57.797
Cool.

11:57.832 --> 11:59.032
- Hi.
- Hello.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.033
(Laura)
What's up?

12:00.067 --> 12:01.201
So I have fantasy.

12:01.235 --> 12:04.004
I heard, my favorite genre.

12:04.038 --> 12:05.172
(Darla)
It's gonna be a worm.

12:05.206 --> 12:06.406
But keeping the face beautiful

12:06.440 --> 12:07.974
is what's gonna
make it attractive.

12:08.009 --> 12:10.343
Attractive female face
on top of a worm body?

12:10.378 --> 12:12.312
(Darla) So we explain
our concept to Laura,

12:12.346 --> 12:15.715
and her initial reaction
is not good.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.384
- This is an attractive look?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:17.418 --> 12:19.686
It'll be definitely...
I mean, not that.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.321
But, I mean, it will be.

12:21.355 --> 12:24.958
As expected, Darla
is doing something beautiful.

12:24.992 --> 12:26.526
But that worm,

12:26.561 --> 12:28.695
I'm not sure that's
a very attractive character.

12:28.729 --> 12:29.996
It's getting frustrating

12:30.031 --> 12:32.699
because I thought the concept
was already nailed down.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.000
You're always talking
about doing something

12:34.035 --> 12:35.001
they've never seen before.

12:35.036 --> 12:36.403
That's true.

12:36.437 --> 12:38.171
That's definitely something
they've never seen before.

12:38.206 --> 12:39.873
You know, like, I'm trying
to think outside the box.

12:39.907 --> 12:41.641
This is not the challenge
to be wasting time,

12:41.676 --> 12:43.443
and I'm getting scared.

12:50.469 --> 12:52.804
There's so much work
going on with that worm.

12:52.838 --> 12:54.672
It's the first day
of the finale challenge,

12:54.707 --> 12:58.543
and Laura's concerned about some
of my decisions, conceptually.

12:58.577 --> 13:01.212
She doesn't like the tree
with the worm idea

13:01.247 --> 13:02.380
for the earth spirit.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.282
(Laura)
You can put vines.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.351
You can put, like,
wood textures.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.787
You can put
all these wonderful things.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.523
I was originally thinking
about doing sort of,

13:11.557 --> 13:13.525
like, an earth goddess

13:13.559 --> 13:15.960
and having vines
wrapping down her legs.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.429
(Laura)
That would totally fit.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.465
(Darla) Thankfully, our concept
finally comes together.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.768
It's a beautiful woman
wearing a tree trunk dress.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.670
And the mushrooms
growing out of her

13:25.704 --> 13:27.539
create a really nice silhouette.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.973
- Is that mushrooms?
- Yeah.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.109
It's those mushrooms
that grow sideways out of trees.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.110
- Yeah.
- Cool.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.711
- Yeah.
- I like this.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.822
Wow.
Hello, everybody.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.024
- Hey, Mr. Westmore.
- Hey.

13:46.058 --> 13:47.926
- I have sci-fi.
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.929
(Logan) And Alan and Julian are both
working on the ship's commander.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.397
(Michael)
I would almost like to see,

13:52.431 --> 13:55.033
in this little ridge that
you have going like that,

13:55.067 --> 13:57.202
go on and bring it on down

13:57.236 --> 13:59.471
'cause it just adds
another dimension to it.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.739
It takes it away
from a human form.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.675
This is going to be
an armadillo.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.643
You know, an armadillo
has all the battle armor.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.278
Don't cut yourself short here.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.048
If your armor isn't going
to come this far forward,

14:10.082 --> 14:11.749
you'd better take it
a little further back,

14:11.784 --> 14:12.784
just to protect yourself.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.018
Okay.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.787
- This is your skunk here?
- This is the skunk.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.956
Take your forehead up
and make this all one piece.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.358
Otherwise, you'd have
to put on eyebrow blenders

14:20.392 --> 14:21.426
to get rid of the eyebrows.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.627
Absolutely.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.229
Our genre's
post-apocalyptic.

14:24.263 --> 14:25.697
Because there's radiation,

14:25.731 --> 14:28.366
their accidents started
to fuse into them,

14:28.400 --> 14:29.934
and then they started
to build armor.

14:29.969 --> 14:33.037
This one had the wood started
to be infused into his chest.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.273
(Michael) What's important with
this is gonna be the paint job.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.975
Keep the wood lighter
so it looks like

14:37.009 --> 14:38.243
it's really a whole pileup

14:38.277 --> 14:40.378
of the wood you have going on.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.046
This is the metal character.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.982
The suit saved his life,
so he doesn't take it off.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.416
But he repairs it.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.151
(Michael) You could have a
burn on him or something

14:47.186 --> 14:50.021
to be able to show
that a bomb went off.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.089
Yeah.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.824
So each of my characters
represents one

14:52.858 --> 14:54.058
of the four elements.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.426
(Michael)
Mm-hmm.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.128
(Darla) The first character
is the water element.

14:57.162 --> 14:58.897
Being water,
it's flowing, and it's soft.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.598
So you want to keep
the face soft

15:00.633 --> 15:01.699
and not get so angular.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.700
Okay.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.735
This is the earth character,

15:03.769 --> 15:05.036
which hasn't been started yet

15:05.070 --> 15:06.437
'cause it took a while
to kind of hone in on.

15:06.472 --> 15:07.639
Wow.
Very, very interesting.

15:07.673 --> 15:08.973
But essentially,
it's going to be

15:09.008 --> 15:10.575
a fabricated tree structure

15:10.609 --> 15:12.944
coming up into
that mushroom growth.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.680
You want to make sure you kind
of get these into the face,

15:15.714 --> 15:18.149
as opposed
to just doing a pretty face

15:18.183 --> 15:20.051
and having the rest...
it becomes a costume then.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.185
Absolutely.

15:21.220 --> 15:24.522
The last character
is our fire character.

15:24.557 --> 15:28.593
The idea was sculpting blue
and white flames flowing up,

15:28.627 --> 15:30.295
like, her neck
and into her face.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.362
You're talking
about blue and white.

15:31.397 --> 15:32.664
You're talking about a gas fire.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.198
I would get a little bit
of red in there.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.367
This could be all red
that's behind her.

15:36.402 --> 15:37.468
Okay.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.070
Good luck to all three teams.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.205
Thanks.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.315
Keep leading these troops.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.215
I like where you guys are going.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.216
Have fun.

15:52.251 --> 15:53.484
(Rayce)
See you, guys.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.220
- See you.
- Bye, guys.

15:56.255 --> 15:57.889
- Jamie.
- What's up?

15:57.923 --> 16:00.191
(Emily) Can you
take this to mold?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.827
I finish all the pieces
for the glass character.

16:02.861 --> 16:06.130
But we're running out of time,
so I grab everyone,

16:06.165 --> 16:07.565
and we're all working together

16:07.600 --> 16:09.467
to mold everything
at the same time.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.936
And we're ahead of schedule,
so I feel good.

16:17.409 --> 16:18.776
(Darla)
That's time, everybody.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.955
I should just
slow everyone down.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.023
(Logan)
It's day two.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.891
We have ten hours
in the lab today.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.093
Do you want me to finish this up

16:35.127 --> 16:36.227
or jump on the cowl?

16:36.261 --> 16:37.695
We got to pick up the pace
a little bit.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.665
My plan today is to make
each of these sculpts cohesive.

16:40.699 --> 16:43.134
So I'm gonna be incorporating
a metallic design

16:43.168 --> 16:44.168
for the characters,

16:44.203 --> 16:45.603
because each
of these characters,

16:45.638 --> 16:47.739
at some point had
repeated tests done

16:47.773 --> 16:49.240
on certain areas of their body.

16:49.274 --> 16:50.875
So we have a lot to do.

16:50.909 --> 16:52.910
I'm gonna start
on the hammerhead.

16:52.945 --> 16:53.945
All right.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.219
(Emily) My team's finishing
their sculptures

17:01.253 --> 17:02.687
while I start working on
the face

17:02.721 --> 17:04.521
for the glass character.

17:04.556 --> 17:06.624
The center of his face
is exposed

17:06.659 --> 17:07.992
with the glass around it,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.926
so I'm going to make
rubber glass,

17:09.962 --> 17:13.631
which is a silicone material
that looks like glass.

17:13.665 --> 17:17.167
Mix ratio is 3a 1b.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.538
But I am awful at math.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.073
I'm gonna go with 20 grams.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.641
And if you mess up the ratios,

17:23.675 --> 17:25.542
then you won't get
the end results.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.345
No, what?
Two, four, six.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.579
In school, it's like,

17:28.614 --> 17:30.148
"Oh, you'll use this
in the real world."

17:30.182 --> 17:32.183
No, we won't.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.086
I'm so bad at all of this.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.087
It's a mess.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.689
Six, seven, eight, nine.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.791
So 960 in total.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.426
I need a calculator.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.594
I hope I got the ratios right.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.768
Stephanie is working on the
chest piece for the air spirit,

17:50.803 --> 17:52.870
and it looks fantastic.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.274
Rob has to fabricate
the entire tree trunk dress

17:56.308 --> 17:57.575
for the earth spirit.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.144
And Daniel is going to mold
the fire spirit torso

18:00.179 --> 18:02.480
while Anthony
jumps on to the cowl

18:02.514 --> 18:03.715
for the earth spirit.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.917
I start sculpting the face
for the fire spirit,

18:05.951 --> 18:09.353
and I'm a little worried
about the sculpted flames

18:09.388 --> 18:10.955
not reading correctly.

18:10.989 --> 18:14.692
But I'm confident that I can
really represent the fire

18:14.727 --> 18:17.795
without trying
to go super literal.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.263
Kind of, like,
building up the flames

18:19.298 --> 18:20.665
so they're
a little more stylized.

18:20.699 --> 18:21.699
Yeah.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.203
Oh.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.145
(Darla)
That's time, everybody.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.021
It's day three of the finale,

18:44.056 --> 18:45.857
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab today.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.692
All right, plan of attack.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.128
My team is hard at work
fabricating

18:50.162 --> 18:51.763
and refining the sculpts.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.065
And then I have to finish
a sculpt

18:54.099 --> 18:56.100
on the fire spirit face,

18:56.135 --> 18:59.937
which because of the flames
is gonna be really complicated.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.913
(Emily)
So this is just a mess.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.816
I'm working on the face
for the glass character.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.718
But the glass is not sticking,

19:13.752 --> 19:15.453
and it's eating up
a lot of time.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.888
I'm feeling very, very nervous.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.956
I have too much to do.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.125
This is the most important part
of my character.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.527
It has to be right.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.328
(Adam) What are you planning
on doing today yourself?

19:24.363 --> 19:25.830
- Just the glass.
- Okay.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.599
I'm getting really frustrated,
because we have a lot to do.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.201
But I'm going to take my time

19:30.235 --> 19:32.603
and make sure
this is done right.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.373
Time is ticking down.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.908
I'm feeling pretty good
at this point.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.943
Everybody's trying
their hardest.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.512
But there's a lot of fabrication
that still needs to be done.

19:41.547 --> 19:45.149
I'm well into my day of painting
these cowls and face pieces,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.819
and I decide to check
on Gregory's progress.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.922
These are gonna have a buckle
here and a buckle here.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.256
I like your innovation,

19:52.291 --> 19:53.624
but I'm absolutely serious

19:53.659 --> 19:56.127
when I say this type
of stuff does not matter.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.496
I realize that he's not
prioritizing very well.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.833
If we don't get this shit...
this thing solid

20:01.867 --> 20:03.267
from an appearance standpoint,

20:03.302 --> 20:06.737
the superficial shit, wearable,

20:06.772 --> 20:07.738
I'm boned.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.006
Now I'm really freaking out

20:09.041 --> 20:10.942
because I thought
everything was under control.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.010
But we're actually way behind.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.178
This could be really bad.

20:20.492 --> 20:21.792
I like your innovation,

20:21.827 --> 20:23.160
but I'm absolutely serious

20:23.195 --> 20:25.329
when I say this type
of stuff does not matter.

20:25.363 --> 20:27.164
It's day three
of our finale challenge,

20:27.199 --> 20:29.633
and the armadillo shell
is behind schedule.

20:29.668 --> 20:33.137
It's cool, but we can
gaff tape this together.

20:33.171 --> 20:35.406
And you would've saved yourself
whatever time it took you

20:35.440 --> 20:36.907
to cut this and shape it
and put it on.

20:36.942 --> 20:39.243
I explained very briefly
to Gregory what I need.

20:39.277 --> 20:42.413
And I think he understands
what's on the line here,

20:42.447 --> 20:43.714
especially for me.

20:43.748 --> 20:47.785
My motto for <i> Face Off</i> has been
no time for hot give,

20:47.819 --> 20:49.386
only enough time for tape.

20:49.421 --> 20:50.421
This is the finale,

20:50.455 --> 20:52.790
and the pace
needs to be kept up.

20:52.824 --> 20:54.825
You can pull it just as tight
around her as you want.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.994
But it's gonna be comfortable
because there's padding

20:57.028 --> 20:58.028
all the way around.

20:58.063 --> 20:59.396
Okay.

21:05.337 --> 21:06.670
- Good luck.
- Bye, Laura.

21:06.705 --> 21:08.139
- Have fun.
- Okay, thank you.

21:08.173 --> 21:09.373
- See you, Logan.
- See you, bro.

21:09.407 --> 21:10.806
You're kicking ass.
Just keep doing it.

21:10.807 --> 21:11.489
Thanks, man.

21:15.013 --> 21:16.680
The olive?

21:16.715 --> 21:17.915
Huh.

21:17.949 --> 21:19.283
It's getting
towards the end of the day,

21:19.317 --> 21:21.819
and the shirt for the earth
spirit is coming together.

21:21.853 --> 21:23.587
And the skirt
is more or less done.

21:23.622 --> 21:25.923
Both of the staffs are finished.

21:25.957 --> 21:27.558
And the face for the fire spirit

21:27.592 --> 21:29.493
has been molded and cleaned out.

21:29.528 --> 21:31.195
- Can you go grab some stencils?
- Yes.

21:31.229 --> 21:32.229
Thank you.

21:40.238 --> 21:41.238
Time, everyone.

21:42.474 --> 21:44.575
(Darla) Everything's coming
together really well.

21:44.609 --> 21:46.377
I feel like I'm really
set up for application.

21:46.411 --> 21:49.146
Luckily, I've got four
amazing artists to help me out.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.722
(Emily) Oh, my God. Here we go.

21:57.756 --> 21:58.789
Nice outfit.

22:01.727 --> 22:02.994
(Logan)
It's application day.

22:03.028 --> 22:05.429
We have four hours in the lab,
one hour of Last Looks.

22:05.464 --> 22:06.797
(Rayce)
Team Logan.

22:06.832 --> 22:08.933
(Logan) This is also our
last day of <i> Face Off.</i>

22:08.967 --> 22:10.067
It's gonna be crazy.

22:10.102 --> 22:11.402
How are you feeling?

22:11.436 --> 22:14.905
My role today is to teach him
how to manage his team

22:14.940 --> 22:17.041
and just make sure
that he's not forgetting

22:17.075 --> 22:18.976
any important steps.

22:19.011 --> 22:22.279
So you know who's gonna
be applying what?

22:22.314 --> 22:23.714
- You got that all planned out?
- No.

22:26.084 --> 22:27.351
(Darla)
Hello.

22:27.386 --> 22:28.619
So you are the wood guy.

22:28.653 --> 22:30.021
We have a lot to do today.

22:30.055 --> 22:33.357
But we have a strong team,
and we're ready to work.

22:33.392 --> 22:34.592
I can't believe it's all over.

22:34.626 --> 22:35.893
Like, this is it.

22:35.927 --> 22:37.895
Right away, I start working
on the wood character,

22:37.929 --> 22:41.465
applying the cowl and face.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.335
Because the leather character
has a lot going on,

22:44.369 --> 22:46.504
Regina and Kelly are gonna share
the responsibility

22:46.538 --> 22:47.938
of applying these pieces.

22:47.973 --> 22:49.707
Adam's working
on the metal character

22:49.741 --> 22:52.576
while Jamie's applying the chest
for the glass character.

22:52.611 --> 22:54.678
I don't know how
this is gonna work out.

22:55.747 --> 22:57.415
[both grunt]

22:57.449 --> 22:58.416
I'm born.

22:58.450 --> 23:01.085
[laughter]

23:01.119 --> 23:03.454
(Darla) My team's working
on the earth, water,

23:03.488 --> 23:04.855
and wind spirits

23:04.890 --> 23:08.259
while I start to apply
the fire spirit character

23:08.293 --> 23:10.928
and paint all the stone texture.

23:10.962 --> 23:14.165
But I still need to make sure
that every single character

23:14.199 --> 23:17.802
ends up as a fully-finished,
beautiful makeup.

23:17.836 --> 23:19.103
Darla.

23:19.137 --> 23:20.838
- Yeah, that's looking great.
- Okay.

23:20.872 --> 23:24.208
Darla and Emily
both want this really bad.

23:24.242 --> 23:27.611
And they seem like they've
set themselves up for success.

23:29.948 --> 23:32.716
Look out,
armadillo coming through.

23:32.751 --> 23:34.718
(Logan)
Ben is on the skunk.

23:34.753 --> 23:37.721
Julian moves on
to the iguana commander.

23:37.756 --> 23:40.291
Alan finishes the fabrication
on the shell.

23:40.325 --> 23:42.893
Gregory is working
on the hammerhead

23:42.928 --> 23:45.396
while I'm focusing
on the armadillo face

23:45.430 --> 23:47.264
plus bouncing around
between each character,

23:47.299 --> 23:49.967
making sure
they're all on the same page.

23:50.001 --> 23:51.502
Don't cut it off.

23:51.536 --> 23:53.404
I'm starting to see
these things come together.

23:53.438 --> 23:57.141
And I really feel like Logan
has got something special.

23:57.175 --> 23:58.676
I feel like he could do this.

23:58.710 --> 23:59.910
He could be the new champion.

24:07.819 --> 24:09.153
(Adam) I'm really out
of my comfort zone,

24:09.187 --> 24:10.154
painting like this.

24:10.188 --> 24:12.790
I look over at Adam's character,

24:12.824 --> 24:14.358
and it's too pink.

24:14.392 --> 24:16.093
- What do you want to do?
- I want to change it.

24:16.128 --> 24:17.128
- Entirely?
- Yeah.

24:17.162 --> 24:19.063
I want it to be more rust color,

24:19.097 --> 24:21.298
more reds, yellows, oranges.

24:21.333 --> 24:24.201
So I go in,
and I start just micromanaging.

24:24.236 --> 24:25.936
I want them to be
in the flesh tone range.

24:25.971 --> 24:27.938
But it's not supposed
to look like super skin tone.

24:27.973 --> 24:29.039
Okay.

24:29.074 --> 24:30.508
(Emily)
Adam's not happy about that,

24:30.542 --> 24:32.776
but I don't have time
to think about his feelings.

24:32.811 --> 24:34.245
This is the finale.

24:34.279 --> 24:36.580
Everything needs to be perfect.

24:36.615 --> 24:37.915
I'm losing my mind.

24:37.949 --> 24:38.916
Oh, welcome.

24:38.950 --> 24:39.984
Welcome to <i> Face Off.</i>

24:45.157 --> 24:47.057
Daniel!
Get me some more moss.

24:50.295 --> 24:51.262
Hey, guys.

24:51.296 --> 24:53.130
No.

24:53.165 --> 24:54.832
You have one hour left.

24:54.866 --> 24:56.800
This is Last Looks.

24:56.835 --> 24:58.369
- Oh, my God.
- Good luck, everybody.

25:02.274 --> 25:03.841
(Darla)
To finish the fire character,

25:03.875 --> 25:06.043
I go through and add
a little bit

25:06.077 --> 25:08.913
of the Kryolan black eye shadow
along her hairline,

25:08.947 --> 25:13.150
just to give it depth
and really make it pop.

25:13.185 --> 25:15.319
(Emily) Jamie, I got to figure
something out for this,

25:15.353 --> 25:16.520
'cause this is not working out.

25:16.555 --> 25:17.688
I'm really nervous right now,

25:17.722 --> 25:19.056
because there's a lot
still to do.

25:19.090 --> 25:20.391
We have a lot more to paint.

25:20.425 --> 25:22.259
(Jamie)
Put some fabric over it.

25:22.294 --> 25:24.295
What kind of fabric?

25:24.329 --> 25:26.530
Should I give him, like,
a vest or, like, a harness?

25:26.565 --> 25:30.534
I just got to work
as fast as I can.

25:30.569 --> 25:32.102
Are we gonna put the tail on?

25:32.137 --> 25:34.338
(Logan) The skunk tail
becomes a priority.

25:34.372 --> 25:36.140
- It's just gonna hang loose.
- That's fine.

25:36.174 --> 25:38.275
That's better than too heavy.

25:38.310 --> 25:39.510
It's got me concerned.

25:39.544 --> 25:42.346
I know it can't go on
at the weight it is.

25:42.380 --> 25:44.048
We'll tuck the skunk tail
into her belt,

25:44.082 --> 25:45.382
let it hang limp.

25:45.417 --> 25:48.619
That will achieve
the silhouette.

25:48.653 --> 25:50.821
15 minutes, everyone.

25:50.855 --> 25:51.855
(Darla)
Oh, my gosh.

25:51.890 --> 25:53.057
Pull.

25:57.495 --> 25:58.562
(Emily)
Oh, my God, Jamie.

26:03.168 --> 26:04.501
That's time, everybody.

26:05.937 --> 26:08.205
(Darla)
Hugs all around.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.974
(Emily) When Last Looks
is up, I'm nervous.

26:10.008 --> 26:11.809
I didn't get a chance
to get everything painted

26:11.843 --> 26:12.810
the way I wanted,

26:12.844 --> 26:14.979
but I'm hoping for the best.

26:27.509 --> 26:29.076
(Logan) You are
gonna be up here.

26:29.110 --> 26:30.978
(Darla)
Step back a little bit.

26:31.012 --> 26:32.079
(Emily)
Move forward.

26:35.683 --> 26:38.685
[cheers and applause]

26:42.223 --> 26:43.657
Hey, everyone.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.726
How you doing tonight?

26:45.760 --> 26:47.995
Yeah.

26:48.029 --> 26:50.431
Welcome to the <i> Face Off</i> finale.

26:50.465 --> 26:54.868
[cheers and applause]

26:54.903 --> 26:56.837
Okay, let's do this.

27:01.743 --> 27:03.744
Whoo-hoo.

27:03.778 --> 27:04.912
There's a lot of people.

27:08.249 --> 27:09.450
This is cool.

27:13.121 --> 27:14.121
So cool.

27:15.423 --> 27:16.957
- Great.
- Wow.

27:21.830 --> 27:22.796
[screams]

27:22.831 --> 27:24.965
[laughter]

27:24.999 --> 27:26.533
(Emily)
Oh, I didn't know they're here.

27:26.568 --> 27:27.534
The judges are here.

27:27.569 --> 27:29.837
- Wow.
- This is really cool.

27:29.871 --> 27:31.238
(Glenn)
That's really great.

27:31.272 --> 27:35.175
It's silicone glued on
to a single piece of clear.

27:35.210 --> 27:36.543
Those are Dorothy's shoes.

27:39.047 --> 27:40.347
This is interesting

27:40.381 --> 27:42.182
'cause they sculpted
what looks to be leather.

27:42.217 --> 27:44.218
Like, it's almost
like somebody else's skin.

27:44.252 --> 27:45.919
- Right.
- Cool.

27:47.722 --> 27:50.257
Well, that's actually
The Cowardly Lion.

27:50.291 --> 27:52.292
(Glenn) It's definitely
a success in terms

27:52.327 --> 27:54.428
of integrating
their fabricated pieces

27:54.462 --> 27:55.796
with the wardrobe.

27:55.830 --> 27:58.098
(man) It seems to have
an element of Mad Max.

27:58.132 --> 28:00.501
Yeah?

28:00.535 --> 28:02.236
(Neville) I don't understand
what we're looking at,

28:02.270 --> 28:03.570
but it looks pretty cool.

29:02.063 --> 29:03.263
(Emily)
The set looks amazing.

29:03.298 --> 29:05.332
And then all the characters
look incredible.

29:05.366 --> 29:07.067
And this is our work out there.

29:07.101 --> 29:09.269
And now people
are reacting to it,

29:09.304 --> 29:11.204
and it's really cool.

29:11.239 --> 29:12.773
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:18.479 --> 29:20.380
They look beautiful.

29:20.415 --> 29:21.949
(man) I love the
scrolling on the face.

29:21.983 --> 29:23.617
It's great.

29:23.651 --> 29:24.785
Oh.

29:24.819 --> 29:27.654
- This chest piece is amazing.
- It really is.

29:27.689 --> 29:29.556
(Ve) And I love the
asymmetry of this.

29:29.591 --> 29:32.426
(woman) Everything is
detailed and intricate.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.227
(Ve) Really pretty
little beauty makeup on,

29:34.262 --> 29:35.829
which is real subtle.

29:35.863 --> 29:37.064
(Neville)
It conveys the idea.

29:37.098 --> 29:38.599
I mean, it's so hard
to indicate flame.

29:38.633 --> 29:40.767
- I mean, after all.
- It's pretty.

29:40.802 --> 29:45.172
I like how her lip color
even matches the green in her.

29:45.206 --> 29:46.173
Oh.

29:46.207 --> 29:47.507
A lot of thought

29:47.542 --> 29:49.276
must've gone into making
that flower thing happen.

29:49.310 --> 29:50.677
(Neville)
But the thing is,

29:50.712 --> 29:52.579
it's not as if they invested
all that time in this

29:52.614 --> 29:53.880
and shortchanged the makeup.

29:53.915 --> 29:55.048
Do you like how they came out?

29:55.083 --> 29:56.583
Yeah.
I'm so happy.

30:56.711 --> 30:58.211
(Darla)
I'm just so happy right now.

30:58.246 --> 30:59.946
These characters
have come to life.

30:59.981 --> 31:04.084
And to see them in the scene
exactly how I imagined them,

31:04.118 --> 31:05.452
it's so incredible.

31:10.658 --> 31:11.758
I love this.

31:11.793 --> 31:13.360
It reminds me of one
of my things from Star Trek.

31:13.394 --> 31:14.461
(McKenzie)
Oh, my gosh.

31:16.998 --> 31:18.865
[laughter]

31:18.900 --> 31:20.200
Oh, God.

31:20.234 --> 31:21.968
(man) I like that a lot,
especially the nose

31:22.003 --> 31:22.969
and the face.

31:23.004 --> 31:23.970
Cute.

31:24.005 --> 31:25.138
- It is cute.
- Yeah.

31:25.173 --> 31:26.907
(Ve) All these tones
are so beautiful,

31:26.941 --> 31:29.042
these browns
and taupe-y greens.

31:29.077 --> 31:30.110
It's really pretty.

31:30.144 --> 31:31.478
Why does she have a tool belt?

31:31.512 --> 31:32.946
Because she's actually
the mechanic too.

31:32.980 --> 31:36.183
Oh.

31:36.217 --> 31:38.852
(Glenn) They definitely have
a team theme going here.

31:38.886 --> 31:42.255
(Ve) I like the tuft of fur coming
out the bottom of the tail.

31:42.290 --> 31:43.523
(Neville)
That's great.

31:43.558 --> 31:44.991
(Logan)
And this is Commander Talon.

31:45.026 --> 31:46.493
He's the leader of the group.

31:46.527 --> 31:47.961
Wow, this is quite beautiful.

31:47.995 --> 31:51.565
It has really nice details
happening on the side.

32:50.491 --> 32:52.259
(Logan) These characters
are incredible.

32:52.293 --> 32:54.060
And I'm having a blast.

32:54.095 --> 32:55.595
I see smiles from the audience.

32:55.630 --> 32:57.197
And that's a win on its own.

33:04.338 --> 33:06.173
I think this was definitely
my favorite

33:06.207 --> 33:08.809
'cause I feel like
it's so much more intricate.

33:08.843 --> 33:10.977
(man) I like The Fortress. I
thought it was beautiful.

33:11.012 --> 33:12.679
It's got a great story to it.

33:12.713 --> 33:14.014
Just really well done.

33:14.048 --> 33:16.049
(woman) My favorite movie
is Paradise Reckoning.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.451
I kind of, like, related
to those characters a lot.

33:18.486 --> 33:20.620
(Emily) It's time for
the audience to leave,

33:20.655 --> 33:22.656
and I'm so scared.

33:22.690 --> 33:24.424
$100,000, a car,

33:24.458 --> 33:27.027
and everything else
is depending on this moment.

33:27.061 --> 33:29.663
It's nerve-racking 'cause
now this is the moment of truth.

33:36.270 --> 33:39.272
Tell us who made your favorite
new film franchise team tonight

33:39.307 --> 33:41.341
on Twitter using #FaceOff

33:44.292 --> 33:46.293
(McKenzie) All right, judges,
so what do you think

33:46.327 --> 33:48.061
of the new franchise film stars
you saw tonight?

33:48.096 --> 33:49.996
I have personally
department headed

33:50.031 --> 33:52.632
five mega-movie franchises.

33:52.667 --> 33:53.767
And I got to tell you,

33:53.801 --> 33:56.803
I think you guys
did an amazing job tonight.

33:56.838 --> 34:00.006
Really, really exceptional,
kids.

34:00.041 --> 34:03.677
(McKenzie)
Nice work, everybody.

34:03.711 --> 34:07.013
Okay, now, there is a lot on
the line tonight for you guys.

34:07.048 --> 34:09.116
The winner will receive
a VIP trip

34:09.150 --> 34:10.951
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

34:10.985 --> 34:13.820
to one of their 85
international locations,

34:13.855 --> 34:17.056
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

34:17.091 --> 34:20.060
and $100,000.

34:20.094 --> 34:21.228
All right, guys,

34:21.262 --> 34:22.996
the judges would like to hear
from each of you

34:23.030 --> 34:26.299
before choosing
this season's winner.

34:26.534 --> 34:27.500
Logan, you're up first.

34:27.534 --> 34:28.534
Please step forward.

34:32.739 --> 34:36.576
What's up?

34:36.610 --> 34:40.447
(Glenn) Logan, tell us about your
sci-fi feature, The Fortress.

34:40.481 --> 34:43.216
They were all,
at one point, lab experiments,

34:43.250 --> 34:45.351
and they took over
the SS Moreau.

34:45.386 --> 34:47.020
Now they travel
throughout the solar system,

34:47.054 --> 34:50.322
trying to stop other labs
from doing the same thing.

34:50.358 --> 34:51.992
I think you guys
did a great job.

34:53.460 --> 34:56.129
It's an extraordinarily
cohesive group.

34:56.163 --> 34:59.799
You did it with the biomechanic,
cybernetic enhancements.

34:59.834 --> 35:01.368
And I like the fact
that you went through

35:01.402 --> 35:04.004
and personalized
each with that element.

35:04.038 --> 35:06.339
I also love Mako's face.

35:06.374 --> 35:10.043
The way that you worked those
subtle shapes over the eyes,

35:10.077 --> 35:11.611
it just all works together.

35:11.645 --> 35:12.746
Thank you very much.

35:12.780 --> 35:13.913
I love your skunk character

35:13.948 --> 35:16.149
because there's
some really subtle,

35:16.183 --> 35:17.917
beautiful paint
on this character.

35:17.952 --> 35:20.620
This could be a really fun movie
to watch.

35:20.654 --> 35:21.888
Maybe one day it will be.

35:21.922 --> 35:23.523
You never know.

35:23.557 --> 35:25.959
(Neville) There's a few things
I want to compliment you on.

35:25.993 --> 35:29.262
One of them is creating
characters that actors

35:29.296 --> 35:32.632
are gonna be inspired
to partake in.

35:32.666 --> 35:35.435
And you've very much succeeded
in that area.

35:35.469 --> 35:36.703
Thank you.

35:36.737 --> 35:38.304
Thank you very much, Logan.

35:38.339 --> 35:39.706
All right, Emily, you're next.

35:47.782 --> 35:49.816
(Ve) Would you please tell
us about your characters

35:49.850 --> 35:51.284
in Paradise Reckoning?

35:51.318 --> 35:54.654
(Emily) After a nuclear
conflict, the world was ending.

35:54.688 --> 35:58.191
And it was split up into mutants
because of all the radiation.

35:58.225 --> 36:02.862
So in this sterile world,
they find a pure human baby.

36:02.897 --> 36:05.065
And the baby
brings them all together.

36:05.099 --> 36:07.967
And it's a spin
on The Wizard of Oz.

36:08.002 --> 36:09.669
(Ve) Every single one
of these characters

36:09.703 --> 36:13.973
has an amazing paint job
on them.

36:14.008 --> 36:15.842
I especially love
her bodice thing.

36:15.876 --> 36:18.778
I actually thought it looked
like patchwork skin to me.

36:18.813 --> 36:20.013
Very impressive.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.848
- Good work, sweetie.
- Thank you.

36:21.882 --> 36:25.685
This is so ambitious
and adventurous.

36:25.719 --> 36:28.388
And as a movie franchise,
this group,

36:28.422 --> 36:32.192
they feel very much
like they are associated,

36:32.226 --> 36:34.527
from a creative standpoint.

36:34.562 --> 36:36.863
(Glenn) I think that you
were very successful

36:36.897 --> 36:41.034
in creating a lot
of very intelligent pieces.

36:41.068 --> 36:45.338
I also love Shard's
broken windshield on his chest.

36:45.372 --> 36:48.141
It really looks exactly
like a broken windshield.

36:48.175 --> 36:49.476
Thank you.

36:49.510 --> 36:50.877
Thank you, Emily.

36:50.911 --> 36:51.911
Darla, you're up.

37:03.991 --> 37:05.358
- Hi, Darla.
- Hi.

37:05.392 --> 37:08.361
Tell us about
The Spirits of Eden.

37:08.395 --> 37:09.529
After Adam and Eve

37:09.563 --> 37:11.464
were banished
from the Garden of Eden,

37:11.499 --> 37:14.567
evil started to take over.

37:14.602 --> 37:17.604
And so the four raw elements...

37:17.638 --> 37:19.372
earth, wind, fire, and water...

37:19.406 --> 37:22.675
had to band together
to fight off the evil.

37:22.710 --> 37:26.513
I think that you absolutely
nailed the genre of fantasy.

37:27.414 --> 37:28.414
Thank you.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.183
One of the things
that we all noticed

37:30.217 --> 37:34.621
was the high-resolution
finesse of detail

37:34.655 --> 37:36.189
on the earth element.

37:36.223 --> 37:39.092
This is a beautiful,
beautiful lineup.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.160
Thank you.

37:40.194 --> 37:42.562
With your wind character,

37:42.596 --> 37:44.097
the body piece is amazing.

37:44.131 --> 37:47.000
It is probably my favorite piece
of wardrobe sculpture

37:47.034 --> 37:48.234
I've seen on the show.

37:48.269 --> 37:52.272
And the horns are a shape
that I have never seen.

37:52.306 --> 37:56.009
(Darla) The idea is that she
herself is a wind instrument.

37:56.043 --> 37:58.278
- That makes it even better.
- Ooh, I got the chills.

37:58.312 --> 37:59.779
[laughs]

37:59.813 --> 38:02.582
(Ve) I think you did an excellent
job with your characters.

38:02.616 --> 38:04.651
You've created prosthetics
that blend right

38:04.685 --> 38:06.853
into the middle of their faces.

38:06.887 --> 38:08.388
You did such a great job.

38:08.422 --> 38:09.956
Thank you all so much.

38:09.990 --> 38:11.591
- Thank you, Darla.
- Thank you.

38:11.625 --> 38:13.293
It's time for you all to head
backstage

38:13.327 --> 38:14.827
while the judges decide

38:14.862 --> 38:18.064
who will become
this season's champion.

38:20.067 --> 38:21.935
All right, before we begin,
I should let you know

38:21.969 --> 38:25.338
which team the public chose
as their favorite.

38:25.372 --> 38:27.907
And that would be
Darla's characters

38:27.942 --> 38:29.442
from The Spirits of Eden.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.277
- Hmm.
- Awesome.

38:31.312 --> 38:32.845
So you can take
that into consideration

38:32.880 --> 38:34.781
when making
your final decision tonight.

38:34.815 --> 38:35.815
Let's get into this.

38:35.849 --> 38:37.250
Why don't we start with Logan?

38:37.284 --> 38:41.888
(Neville) They were playful
and cohesive as a team.

38:41.922 --> 38:43.056
(Ve)
I absolutely agree.

38:43.090 --> 38:45.491
I mean, each one of them
had a unique character

38:45.526 --> 38:47.493
that was immediately visible.

38:47.528 --> 38:49.729
I love the hammerhead
shark character.

38:49.763 --> 38:51.164
I think that was fantastic,

38:51.198 --> 38:53.566
particularly in terms
of hiding the eyes.

38:53.601 --> 38:56.502
The iguana character
had amazing primary

38:56.537 --> 38:58.104
and sub form in the sculpture.

38:58.138 --> 38:59.973
I did love that paint job
on that skunk.

39:00.007 --> 39:02.041
I thought it was really
beautifully done.

39:02.076 --> 39:03.776
Okay, let's move on to Emily.

39:03.811 --> 39:05.878
(Ve) Just beautiful
control with paint.

39:05.913 --> 39:08.281
She just picks out some
of the most beautiful palettes

39:08.315 --> 39:09.282
to paint with.

39:09.316 --> 39:11.217
That wooden guy,
that was gorgeous.

39:11.252 --> 39:14.954
(Neville)
I liked how realistic it was.

39:14.989 --> 39:16.990
I think Emily
is loaded with raw talent.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.425
Shard had that beautiful
chest piece,

39:19.460 --> 39:22.662
which is all silicone
on a clear piece of plastic.

39:22.696 --> 39:25.732
It immediately read
as a broken windshield.

39:25.766 --> 39:27.400
All right,
that leaves us with Darla.

39:27.434 --> 39:30.169
(Ve) Well, she came out with four
beautifully-rendered makeups,

39:30.204 --> 39:32.905
absolutely exquisite
on those women.

39:32.940 --> 39:35.108
Blend right in the middle
of their faces.

39:35.142 --> 39:37.076
Really beautifully done.

39:37.111 --> 39:41.281
And the one that really
is a standout character

39:41.315 --> 39:43.383
is the elemental wind.

39:43.417 --> 39:48.321
The genius of doing the holes
in the horns

39:48.355 --> 39:50.823
and the perforations
in the chest piece

39:50.858 --> 39:54.327
as an indication of
some other acoustic element,

39:54.361 --> 39:55.928
that's some high-level thinking.

39:55.963 --> 39:57.697
Absolutely awe-inspiring.

39:57.731 --> 40:00.066
(McKenzie) All right,
judges, big decision.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.268
Are you ready to crown
a new champion

40:02.303 --> 40:04.637
and our first
two-time champion?

40:04.672 --> 40:06.072
I think we are.

40:06.106 --> 40:07.106
Let's do this.

40:10.811 --> 40:12.045
All right, guys, one of you

40:12.079 --> 40:14.947
is about to become
our new champion.

40:17.384 --> 40:18.951
And one of our champion coaches

40:18.986 --> 40:22.755
is about to become
our first two-time champion.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.991
So good luck to all of you.

40:25.025 --> 40:28.161
All right, Glenn,
tell us about tonight's makeups.

40:28.195 --> 40:30.463
Logan, the fun factor
of your characters

40:30.497 --> 40:34.267
really drove home the
team aspect of this challenge.

40:34.301 --> 40:38.037
And the paint work on several
of them was exceptional.

40:38.072 --> 40:41.741
Emily, you put on a really wild
display of creativity tonight,

40:41.775 --> 40:43.409
and they all clearly
went together.

40:43.444 --> 40:45.378
But each was also
distinctly different,

40:45.412 --> 40:47.547
which is an impressive feat.

40:47.581 --> 40:50.183
Darla, you gave us an array
of fantasy characters

40:50.217 --> 40:52.185
that read superbly from afar.

40:52.219 --> 40:55.988
But each of them also had
unique and gorgeous detail

40:56.023 --> 40:57.323
when we got up close.

40:57.358 --> 41:01.194
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner of <i> Face Off?</i>

41:01.228 --> 41:02.595
The winner of <i> Face Off</i> is...

41:14.052 --> 41:17.788
(McKenzie) All right, Glenn,
who is the winner of <i> Face Off?</i>

41:17.823 --> 41:19.490
The winner of <i> Face Off</i> is...

41:26.398 --> 41:27.365
Darla.

41:27.399 --> 41:30.401
[cheers and applause]

41:32.471 --> 41:36.173
(McKenzie) Congratulations, you
are the new <i> Face Off</i> champion.

41:40.212 --> 41:42.580
This is...
this is crazy.

41:42.614 --> 41:44.148
That's like...
it's crazy.

41:44.182 --> 41:46.283
I'm so excited,
and I'm so proud.

41:46.318 --> 41:47.585
I'm so happy.

41:47.619 --> 41:48.819
I can't really keep it together.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.755
[laughs]

41:50.789 --> 41:52.156
I'm very happy for Darla.

41:52.190 --> 41:53.324
Of course, I'm bummed.

41:53.358 --> 41:55.426
But I think it motivates me
to do better.

41:55.460 --> 41:58.596
I've definitely
found my passion.

41:58.630 --> 42:00.231
I'm proud of everything
that I've accomplished.

42:00.265 --> 42:02.833
This competition's definitely
given me the confidence

42:02.868 --> 42:04.402
to just make stuff.

42:04.436 --> 42:06.671
And, of course, that means
that huge congratulations

42:06.705 --> 42:08.439
are in order to Laura as well.

42:08.473 --> 42:11.509
You are the first-ever repeat
champion of <i> Face Off.</i>

42:11.543 --> 42:13.477
How about that?

42:13.512 --> 42:14.845
I'm very excited,

42:14.880 --> 42:17.548
because winning <i> Face Off</i>
is a life-changing experience,

42:17.582 --> 42:19.250
and I'm overwhelmed with pride

42:19.284 --> 42:20.651
that I accomplished it twice.

42:20.686 --> 42:22.420
It's an exhilarating feeling,
and I'm glad.

42:22.454 --> 42:23.621
I'm so honored.

42:23.655 --> 42:25.156
(McKenzie) Come on up
here and celebrate.

42:25.190 --> 42:26.157
Come on, judges too.

42:26.191 --> 42:27.425
Come on.

42:27.459 --> 42:30.127
Congratulations.
You're so good at this.

42:30.162 --> 42:31.462
(Darla)
Thank you.

42:31.496 --> 42:33.497
(Laura) It was a great
experience for everybody.

42:33.532 --> 42:34.965
But it doesn't seem right,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.001
just one person winning this,

42:37.035 --> 42:39.370
when we all are so influential.

42:39.404 --> 42:41.672
- You're still gonna cry?
- Yes.

42:41.707 --> 42:43.007
(Darla)
I'm so grateful to Laura.

42:43.041 --> 42:45.109
I've grown so much as an artist.

42:45.143 --> 42:48.112
This has been a really crazy,
crazy ride,

42:48.146 --> 42:50.181
and I can't wait to see
what's next.

42:50.215 --> 42:52.216
Thank you all at home
for watching us tonight.

42:52.250 --> 42:53.617
Join us again in July

42:53.652 --> 42:55.820
for another exciting new season.

42:55.854 --> 42:56.854
Have a good night.
