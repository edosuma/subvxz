00:01.034 --> 00:02.661
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:02.735 --> 00:06.467
I just stopped by to tell you I'm going
to the apartment to pick up my stuff.

00:06.539 --> 00:08.837
I've always thought
you were the future of this firm.

00:08.908 --> 00:12.344
I just think the way I play
the game has got to change.

00:12.412 --> 00:15.506
You were so sure breaking things off
was the right thing to do.

00:26.526 --> 00:30.622
Look at this place.
It's perfect, gorgeous.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.996
It's everything I imagined. Oh, it's...

00:34.067 --> 00:38.197
Hotter than the damn sun!
My arm hair just singed off.

00:38.271 --> 00:41.570
Dave, Jen, enjoy your vacation!

00:41.641 --> 00:44.075
I hope the underwater camera works out!

00:44.978 --> 00:46.468
What nice people.

00:46.546 --> 00:49.208
Look at this place.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.184
Have you ever seen
an ocean like this?

00:52.285 --> 00:55.448
Yeah, in California.
It's the same ocean.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.285
I'm really glad we're doing this.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.622
This is what they mean when they say,
"Make every moment count. "

01:00.693 --> 01:03.719
Look at us, nine hours ago we
were at work. Now we're just...

01:03.797 --> 01:05.355
Getting heat stroke.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.628
Don't get too excited.
We have work to do. Where's our car?

01:10.036 --> 01:13.403
We'll walk. Look, it'll be fun.
We can take in the scenery.

01:13.473 --> 01:17.500
I'm wearing a wool suit. My internal
organs are boiling in their own juices.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.670
Oh, OK, I get it.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.214
- You're trying to tell me you're...
- Hot!

01:22.282 --> 01:24.512
Hot! Hot! Hot!

01:24.584 --> 01:26.609
How many times
you gotta burn your hand

01:26.686 --> 01:29.052
before you learn
to take out the plate first?

01:29.122 --> 01:32.023
System's worked for me
for 30 years. What's going on?

01:32.092 --> 01:35.926
Well, there are some rumors floating
around that you're not going to like.

01:35.995 --> 01:39.260
Which do you want to hear first?
Terrible rumor one or two?

01:39.332 --> 01:41.459
- Pick number one.
- I pick number two.

01:43.603 --> 01:47.562
They're saying your win on
the Wolverine SUV case five years ago...

01:47.640 --> 01:50.575
...is overturned.
You're gonna have to retry it.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.206
It's not gonna happen.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.941
Posner took over the case
once the appeal was filed.

01:56.015 --> 01:59.178
He'll handle the retrial
if it doesn't settle, which it will.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.775
How can you be so sure?

02:00.854 --> 02:03.982
Jeffrey Powell's been working
on this case on contingency,

02:04.057 --> 02:06.025
as in unpaid, for the last five years.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.458
Even self-righteous
do-gooders need to eat.

02:08.527 --> 02:11.554
Besides, this case was tried
by Old Eli.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.758
Everyone around here knows I'm New Eli.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.324
New Eli is no longer working
on the side of Evil.

02:16.402 --> 02:19.701
I don't think New Eli understands
how this place works.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.935
As our senior partner
is momentarily absent,

02:23.042 --> 02:26.136
let's turn our attention
to mundane matters such as,

02:26.212 --> 02:31.172
the Photocopy Department reports paper
usage down 8.3 percent this month.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.342
Explanations?

02:32.418 --> 02:34.477
It has to do with some green program.

02:34.554 --> 02:37.580
I got like a million memos on it,
which is kinda ironic.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.785
Well, those memos
were printed on recycled paper.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.727
Ms. Dekker,
I applaud your willingness

02:43.796 --> 02:47.755
to avert what, no doubt, you perceive
to be "an inconvenient truth. "

02:47.834 --> 02:51.531
However, copying
is a profit center for this firm,

02:51.604 --> 02:54.869
which charges clients
a 35 percent mark-up.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.499
More copies, people.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.807
Next item: Mitchell
vs. Zyre Motors, Incorporated.

02:59.879 --> 03:04.509
Late last night the First District Court
of Appeals overturned our victory.

03:04.584 --> 03:09.146
You will once again take the lead on
the Wolverine SUV litigation, Mr. Stone.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.223
And I will, once again, be second chair.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.814
Sir, I don't think that...

03:14.394 --> 03:17.227
Well, I'm... I'm actually New Eli.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.733
I think this is more
of a case for... Old Eli.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.291
Well, perhaps you two
can have a conference call.

03:23.369 --> 03:27.533
Old Eli is uniquely familiar
with the Wolverine case.

03:27.607 --> 03:31.134
He has a settlement conference
with Jeffrey Powell in half an hour.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.542
Jeffrey Powell?

03:33.746 --> 03:37.204
I've always wanted to meet...
kick his ass, sir.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.751
I'd like to help Mr. Stone...

03:39.819 --> 03:40.877
...kick it.

03:40.954 --> 03:45.516
Very well. It'll do you some good to
bill some real hours to a real client.

03:45.625 --> 03:49.152
Sorry I'm late, but I had good reason.
Excellent reason, in fact.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.697
I was welcoming our new hires.

03:51.764 --> 03:55.393
I'm pleased to introduce Keith Bennett.

03:55.468 --> 03:59.234
And proving that nepotism
and merit are not mutually exclusive,

03:59.872 --> 04:01.703
my daughter,

04:01.774 --> 04:03.241
Taylor Wethersby.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.707
You joined the firm?

04:07.780 --> 04:10.749
The firm where I work?
Until last week, we were engaged.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.080
We should probably
talk about last week.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.712
We slept together.
I don't need to talk about it.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.620
I can tell from the way
you haven't returned my calls.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.057
Were you calling
to get back together, Eli?

04:22.662 --> 04:24.391
That's why I didn't call you back.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.955
You figured we'd just
see each other at work.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.898
Oh, don't read anything into it.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.699
What other reason could you have
for leaving your firm of eight years

04:32.772 --> 04:35.070
and coming to work here
with your ex-fiancé?

04:35.141 --> 04:38.042
My father's been recruiting me
to work here for years.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.877
This firm needs a specialist in Family
Law and I happen to be a good one,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.245
an excellent one.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.546
In fact, WPK
is damn lucky to have me.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.114
Just...

04:49.188 --> 04:50.450
Killer waves.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.253
I gotta... One second.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.984
It's Keith, right?

05:26.092 --> 05:27.354
I'm Eli.

05:30.763 --> 05:31.923
Welcome to the firm.

05:37.236 --> 05:40.694
Donald, you know
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.113
Showing up in my office at 9:30am...

05:52.185 --> 05:55.712
It's sad, actually, how much
you obviously still want me.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.418
Bense, what is it?

06:01.494 --> 06:04.224
Needed face time
with my favorite ex-boyfriend.

06:04.297 --> 06:08.256
I'm your only ex-boyfriend. You've
been crying. Something happen at work?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.131
It's nothing.

06:10.236 --> 06:14.002
Just my life completely falling apart.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.233
Is the baby OK?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.173
Yeah, the baby's fine. It's Donna.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.076
She's having some sort of breakdown.
She's moved out.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.708
But... she's pregnant.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.341
I know she's pregnant.

06:25.451 --> 06:28.215
I was at the embryo transfer.
It's my egg, for God's sakes.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.289
I don't get it. Is there someone else?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.823
Yes.

06:32.892 --> 06:33.916
Jesus.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.659
My former lesbian lover
is now a heterosexual Jesus freak.

06:40.099 --> 06:42.727
She's seeking sole custody of the baby.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.061
She's hired a lawyer.

06:45.171 --> 06:49.005
Yeah? Well, so have you.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.780
Mr. Powell. Maggie Dekker.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.178
I'm a big fan.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.376
I wrote a paper during law school

06:58.451 --> 07:00.749
on your strategy
in the Nuxoll class action.

07:00.820 --> 07:04.187
This is a new trick,
trying to distract me with a sycophant.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.258
It's like you can
see right through me.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.418
You're the worst kind of lawyer.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.463
A hypocrite who pretends
she cares for the common man

07:11.531 --> 07:13.965
while big business
heats her pool, OK?

07:14.033 --> 07:15.898
Congratulations on the appeal.

07:16.302 --> 07:19.863
You pulled a rabbit out. But since
we both know you're out of tricks...

07:19.972 --> 07:23.271
- You're the expert on tricks.
- We went over this five years ago.

07:23.342 --> 07:27.472
Subpoena's still on the books, as is the
court order granting motion to compel.

07:27.547 --> 07:28.514
What am I missing?

07:28.614 --> 07:31.447
It's what I'm missing. Stanley Lyme.

07:31.517 --> 07:35.783
I can't find him, Jeff. I'd have better
luck finding WMDs in Iraq.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.016
- Subpoena those.
- Who's Stanley Lyme?

07:38.090 --> 07:40.024
An engineer, worked for Zyre Motors.

07:40.092 --> 07:43.653
One of 12 he wanted to depose, none
of whom had anything of note to say.

07:43.729 --> 07:48.428
But Lyme is the only one to conveniently
disappear before I could depose him.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.470
Wasn't my fault. We're a law firm,
not witness protection.

07:51.571 --> 07:55.507
So instead of going on another fishing
expedition, why don't we settle this,

07:55.575 --> 07:58.100
- and avoid repeating history.
- If you want to.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.237
This is our number.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.814
Checking to see if the zeroes stop.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.718
Half of what a jury
will award for lost income,

08:08.788 --> 08:10.517
pain and suffering, punitives.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.423
I already won once.
What makes you think I won't again?

08:13.493 --> 08:16.587
This time, the jury won't
be shielded from the consequences

08:16.662 --> 08:18.687
of Zyre Motors' criminal negligence.

08:18.764 --> 08:20.129
What's he talking about?

08:20.233 --> 08:23.566
Five years ago, Adam Mitchell's
injuries were so gruesome,

08:23.636 --> 08:26.503
Eli was able to convince the judge
that the sight of them

08:26.572 --> 08:27.903
would prejudice a jury.

08:27.974 --> 08:32.034
So they heard a dry recitation
of Adam's testimony transcript.

08:32.111 --> 08:36.013
But this time, the jury will hear
Adam's story from Adam himself.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.020
Nice to see you again, Mr. Stone.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.768
You spent the night here?

09:06.746 --> 09:10.045
Posner told me to bill more hours.
So I started looking for Lyme.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.542
Not even Posner
wants you to pad the bill

09:12.618 --> 09:15.382
looking for a witness that could
help the other side.

09:15.454 --> 09:18.082
We are legally obligated
to find Stanley Lyme.

09:18.157 --> 09:21.820
No, we are legally obligated to make
a reasonable effort to find him.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.452
And I made it five years ago.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.020
I was thinking maybe
he has friends, relatives.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.725
I found them. I asked. Nothing.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.667
There is actual work
I need you to do for this case.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.704
A case you volunteered for, remember?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.535
That was before I knew
we were working on the side of evil,

09:37.610 --> 09:40.170
representing a company
that manufactures an SUV

09:40.279 --> 09:42.247
that flips over, crippling people.

09:42.348 --> 09:46.284
There is no evidence that Zyre Motors
was responsible for his accident.

09:46.352 --> 09:50.186
Just because Adam Mitchell's in a
wheelchair, it doesn't make him a saint.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.687
Either way, it's a yucky case.

09:52.758 --> 09:53.918
"Yucky?"

09:53.993 --> 09:57.759
Did you get your law degree by watching
Legally Blonde a bunch of times?

09:57.863 --> 10:02.357
If we have to try to win, I'm at least
going to make sure we win by the rules.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.595
I'm finding Mr. Lyme.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.604
You know this won't make
Jeffrey Powell like you, right?

10:06.672 --> 10:08.435
I don't really care if he likes me.

10:08.507 --> 10:11.999
A little respect would be nice...
from both of you.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.742
- Eli!
- Hey! What...

10:14.814 --> 10:17.339
Hey, hey! Stop it!
Brain aneurysm, remember?

10:17.416 --> 10:20.351
It was bad enough when Taylor
was calling me 16 times a day.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.683
Now she's working here.
You didn't stop it?

10:22.755 --> 10:26.384
I didn't know. It's not like she
consulted me before she took the job.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.949
Want me to get her fired?

10:28.027 --> 10:30.723
Good thinking.
I'll get you in with Mr. Wethersby.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.731
Even if I could convince Jordan
to fire his own daughter,

10:33.799 --> 10:37.758
I can't do that,
because last week I sort of...

10:37.870 --> 10:40.600
- Go on.
... slept with her.

10:42.241 --> 10:43.970
You fell off the wagon!

10:44.043 --> 10:46.307
How could you do that to me?

10:46.379 --> 10:48.609
I wasn't thinking of you at that moment.

10:48.681 --> 10:52.515
Well, thank God.

10:55.187 --> 10:58.645
Mr. Posner. What a surprise to
see you here. How are you today, sir?

10:58.724 --> 10:59.782
Patricia.

11:04.764 --> 11:08.700
Ready, Mr. Stone? We're due in court
for opening statements in 20 minutes.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.332
The baby was conceived
using my client's egg.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.966
How about we all agree this is something
of a grey area and compromise:

11:16.042 --> 11:18.476
- Jessica and Donna co-parent.
- Typical.

11:18.544 --> 11:22.105
Ask us to concede everything we
believe in and call it a "compromise".

11:22.181 --> 11:24.615
Donna's free
to give up chicks for dudes.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.120
In fact, on behalf of dudes everywhere,
I welcome her endorsement.

11:28.187 --> 11:31.020
In the absence of an agreement,
Donna has all the rights

11:31.090 --> 11:33.991
that fall to a child's birth mother,
including the right

11:34.060 --> 11:37.188
to protect that child from
any influences she deems harmful.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.322
I'm a harmful influence now?

11:39.398 --> 11:42.265
- I need to protect my baby.
- Our baby.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.996
We're confident
to let the judge decide that one.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.306
I need your breasts.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.934
Is this some sort of test
to see how litigious I am?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.342
When it comes to sexual harassment,
the answer is "very. "

11:54.413 --> 11:58.349
I'm representing a chick, who's suing
a chick, who's represented by a chick.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.578
I just found out
the judge happens to be...

12:00.653 --> 12:02.587
- A chick?
- Exactly.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.488
You know, if they were all black,
I'd ask that Keith guy.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.494
But I really need a woman
up there with me. This is important.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.325
You couldn't have just said that?

12:11.397 --> 12:12.921
I thought I did.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.330
The client's a friend.
We dated in college.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.531
And she's suing her ex-girlfriend for
parental rights over their unborn fetus.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.368
Your ex-girlfriend's a lesbian?

12:21.440 --> 12:22.668
Who isn't these days?

12:22.742 --> 12:25.404
Anyway, it's a family case,
that's your thing,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.946
and I could really use the help.

12:28.013 --> 12:31.574
Besides, think about how crazy
it's gonna drive Stone.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.916
Ha-ha.

12:33.986 --> 12:36.511
- All right, tell me about the case.
- OK.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.922
In one instant, a life can change.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.426
They say a picture
is worth a thousand words.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.556
At the end of this trial,
you'll be asked to put a price tag

12:46.632 --> 12:50.796
on how much this young man's
ability to walk is worth.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.237
I hope you're prepared to do that.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.345
Oh, it is wonderful dating in Miami.

13:08.420 --> 13:12.083
All the single men under 80
are cocaine smugglers.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.495
The Golden Girls. It was a great show.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.356
You're probably wondering
what it has to do with this case.

13:21.433 --> 13:25.665
Well, I'll tell you. About as much as
the footage Mr. Powell just showed you.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.832
That wasn't the SUV
that Adam Mitchell was driving

13:28.908 --> 13:31.069
and that wasn't Adam Mitchell
driving it.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.805
Oh, and Adam Mitchell's car
never caught fire.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.370
No, that was just a stunt

13:36.448 --> 13:38.678
to make you angry at my client.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.878
Mr. Powell said that at the end of...

13:51.664 --> 13:53.632
...that at the end of this trial,

13:53.732 --> 13:56.360
you'll be asked to put
a price tag on walking.

14:00.873 --> 14:06.243
Anyone who looks at this trial
fairly and objectively...

14:22.194 --> 14:23.684
Mr. Stone?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.729
Nothing further.

14:42.681 --> 14:44.842
I need flip-flops
to go to the men's room.

14:44.950 --> 14:48.442
And now...
now there's singing in court.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.080
The one place that's been vision-free.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.249
And what's this week's musical number?

14:53.325 --> 14:55.350
One More Try, by guess who.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.055
George Michael.
What are you, his comeback tour?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.860
Can we just proceed
to the vision interpretation?

15:00.933 --> 15:02.230
One More Try.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.963
Here you are,
trying a case one more time.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.870
Maybe God wants you
to do things differently this time.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.306
God can send one
of the pillar of fire thingies,

15:10.409 --> 15:12.036
I still couldn't drop the case.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.341
Free will is what defines us, Eli.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.641
Oh, really?

15:15.714 --> 15:20.674
Because I don't feel like
it was a choice to be a prophet.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.618
Things were so much easier before.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.656
I wasn't so confused all the time,

15:24.757 --> 15:26.384
and morally conflicted...

15:26.458 --> 15:29.757
Alone? Is this still about Taylor?

15:29.828 --> 15:31.693
She joined my firm.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.130
Oh, that's why you're so crabby.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.259
I miss her. Seeing her every day
is just gonna make it worse.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.566
Eli, what you're going through is rough.

15:39.638 --> 15:42.937
You shouldn't go through it alone
if you don't have to.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.873
Maybe One More Try is about her.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.468
Is this multiple choice?

15:46.545 --> 15:50.072
It's not like I have a copy of Prophecy
For Dummies lying around here.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.443
What do you think the visions are about?

15:53.519 --> 15:55.817
It was like a sign from God.

15:55.888 --> 15:59.984
My first ultrasound, when I saw
that tiny little heartbeat.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.086
A small miracle
was growing inside of me and I...

16:04.964 --> 16:09.799
...I realized that I was going to be
responsible for another person's soul.

16:09.868 --> 16:13.497
- And I knew what I had to do.
- Renounce the homosexual lifestyle?

16:13.572 --> 16:15.540
Objection to the term "lifestyle".

16:15.641 --> 16:18.542
It's prejudicial,
close-minded, and offensive.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.942
It's nice to see you
suddenly so supportive

16:21.013 --> 16:22.742
of the gay movement, Mr. Dowd.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.541
Now pipe down.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.810
Well, I never considered myself gay.

16:29.888 --> 16:32.356
I always thought
that I would marry a man.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.393
But I fell in love with Jessica.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.190
And I thought
that I could love her enough

16:38.263 --> 16:42.427
to make myself something
that I'm just... not.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.695
And how did you come
to that realization?

16:44.770 --> 16:49.332
After the ultrasound,
I started going back to church.

16:49.441 --> 16:52.877
After a few months,
and a whole lot of prayer,

16:52.945 --> 16:55.175
I knew what I had to do.

16:55.247 --> 16:58.182
My family is speaking to me now.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.644
They're welcoming me back home.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.782
This is what I want.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.019
This is what my baby needs.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.691
You're carrying a fetus
conceived with Jessica's egg?

17:16.769 --> 17:20.227
- Yes, but...
- Were you infertile?

17:20.305 --> 17:22.671
- No. Nothing like that.
- Then I'm confused.

17:22.775 --> 17:26.233
Why would you go through a costly
and time-consuming procedure

17:26.310 --> 17:28.040
to carry someone else's baby,

17:28.113 --> 17:31.014
Miss Milton,
if you didn't intend to co-parent?

17:31.083 --> 17:34.177
I was a different person then.
I wasn't myself.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.086
You seem to have
a relatively smart lawyer there.

17:37.156 --> 17:41.320
I'm kind of surprised she hasn't
told you that doesn't matter.

17:42.528 --> 17:46.020
It was indescribable.
I could barely breathe.

17:46.098 --> 17:49.590
The roof was crushed in.
It was pressing against my head.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.533
And I felt like if I just let go,

17:54.540 --> 17:56.201
that it would all be over.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.835
What kept you hanging on?

18:00.779 --> 18:02.440
My cell phone, funny enough.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.150
It started ringing
and I couldn't reach it,

18:07.219 --> 18:09.551
but I could see Cori's number
on the caller ID.

18:10.689 --> 18:14.056
And I knew that I had to hold on

18:14.126 --> 18:16.185
so I could dance with her
at our wedding.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.832
According to the statement
you gave the CHP,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.772
your SUV flipped
when you swerved to avoid,

18:29.842 --> 18:33.710
and I'm quoting here,
"a metal object in the road. "

18:33.779 --> 18:35.406
Yeah, that's right.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.041
Where were you driving from?

18:38.150 --> 18:42.450
The Deer Hunter Lodge.
I was having dinner with Cori.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.580
The Deer Hunter Lodge and Tavern.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.886
Did you consume alcohol that night?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.086
A few beers. But I wasn't drunk.

18:49.161 --> 18:51.391
Right. You only had a few beers.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.433
Your wife called you on her cell.
Where was she?

18:55.534 --> 18:58.469
- She was back at the Lodge.
- The Lodge and Tavern.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.097
- So you left without her?
- Cori and I...

19:02.307 --> 19:04.741
...we had an argument,
but it wasn't a big deal.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.678
Must have been quite a few police and
EMT personnel at the accident scene.

19:08.747 --> 19:12.046
Any of them find the object
that you say caused you to swerve?

19:12.117 --> 19:14.677
- You would have to ask them.
- I did.

19:14.753 --> 19:19.247
I have affidavits from every
single police officer and EMT

19:19.324 --> 19:21.690
who was at the accident scene that night

19:21.760 --> 19:24.194
and none of them
found that metal object.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.231
Objection. Facts not in evidence.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.198
I agree.
That metal object is not in evidence.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.194
Let me see
if I have this straight.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.535
You had a few drinks,
but you weren't drunk.

19:34.606 --> 19:38.838
You left your fiancée alone in a bar
after a fight that wasn't that bad.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.074
And you swerved to avoid
a metal object that no one found.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.344
That SUV was defective.
That is why it rolled over.

19:45.417 --> 19:49.854
Yes, it rolled over. But that
doesn't mean it was defective, sir.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.288
And it doesn't mean
that your driving wasn't.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.722
Maggie, don't give me that look.
I was doing my job.

19:56.795 --> 20:00.026
I don't want to watch it.
I won't be in court tomorrow.

20:00.098 --> 20:03.431
I'm gonna find Lyme.
Maybe he knows what's right.

20:06.672 --> 20:09.641
I hope you're happy with yourself.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.070
Do any women around here
like me anymore?

20:39.838 --> 20:41.533
Where the hell am I?

20:42.441 --> 20:44.739
- Hawaii, bro'.
- Hawaii?

20:51.617 --> 20:54.450
Eli! Eli!

20:55.754 --> 20:57.119
Eli, are you OK?

20:57.189 --> 20:59.157
You passed out on the bathroom floor.

21:02.628 --> 21:06.462
- I did?
- I'm calling your brother.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.461
Taylor, Taylor, come in here.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.704
Just...

21:15.440 --> 21:16.805
Please don't call Nate.

21:16.908 --> 21:20.241
It would be very considerate of you
to forget this ever happened.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.145
What about the guy who dragged you
out of the men's room,

21:23.215 --> 21:25.911
the 50 lawyers, paralegals,
and assistants who saw?

21:25.984 --> 21:28.680
I'd say I've been doing a cleanse,
got light-headed.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.585
What really happened, Eli?

21:30.656 --> 21:34.786
Normal stuff. I walked in
and suddenly I was in Hawaii.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.624
Just like you to go
on our honeymoon without me.

21:37.729 --> 21:41.597
Look on the bright side, you know. At
least this isn't your problem anymore.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.661
I want you to be my problem.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.868
You joined the firm because of me?

21:50.008 --> 21:51.498
You make it sound pathetic.

21:52.477 --> 21:56.345
I don't think it's pathetic to fight
for something that's important to you.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.849
Something that's the most important.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.818
I'm going to be here every day,
Eli, until you give us...

22:01.887 --> 22:03.752
One More Try.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.822
Taylor, if you're free tomorrow night,

22:11.496 --> 22:16.456
I think we're supposed to...
I mean, I'd like to talk things out.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.833
Go for dinner together?

22:21.907 --> 22:22.999
I'd love that.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.381
You've got to be kidding me.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.321
Why are we only hearing
about this alleged waiver now?

22:38.390 --> 22:40.881
These documents were never produced.

22:40.959 --> 22:44.451
We just received Ms. Benson's paperwork
from the clinic yesterday.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.554
This is a motion for injunctive relief,

22:46.631 --> 22:49.794
therefore no discovery,
therefore no obligation to produce.

22:49.901 --> 22:54.065
"Donor hereby waives all parental rights
and relinquishes all such duties

22:54.139 --> 22:57.506
to any child resulting from the
fertilized human egg hereunder. "

22:57.576 --> 22:59.203
I can see why you're pole-axed.

22:59.277 --> 23:01.768
Ms. Benson provided us
with all her documents.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.747
This waiver was not among them.

23:03.815 --> 23:04.907
She signed it.

23:04.983 --> 23:08.214
A fair point.
Waiver's signed, waiver's in.

23:09.354 --> 23:11.219
What about visitation?

23:11.289 --> 23:14.190
I'll go to Ohio every other weekend.
I'll move there.

23:14.259 --> 23:15.624
Don't do this to yourself.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.024
What do you mean?

23:18.330 --> 23:21.299
You might want to start considering
the possibility...

23:22.067 --> 23:24.433
...that you won't be a part
of the baby's life.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.201
But you have other options, Jess.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.905
You can have another baby...

23:37.783 --> 23:39.614
...with someone who loves you.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.747
I'm not saying like a couple
or anything.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.885
I could just donate some of my boys.

23:50.796 --> 23:54.061
Heck, if you want, I could even
do it the old-fashioned way.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.965
I'm truly selfless like that.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.195
Matt...

23:58.970 --> 24:02.303
...beneath that frat boy exterior,
you're actually very sweet.

24:03.141 --> 24:07.202
You always were.
But I don't want just any baby.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.976
I want the one I made
with the woman I love.

24:13.819 --> 24:14.979
Right.

24:15.086 --> 24:20.524
It was devastating. One minute,
we had our entire lives ahead of us.

24:20.592 --> 24:23.561
And the next,
I was changing out his catheter.

24:23.662 --> 24:27.996
I gave up my career when we realized
Adam would need around-the-clock care.

24:28.066 --> 24:31.229
- It must be hard.
- We take it day by day.

24:31.336 --> 24:34.066
Some days are better than others, for...

24:34.139 --> 24:37.472
...Adam and for me.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.407
How do you get through the bad days?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.447
I remember how close we came
to not having any days,

24:42.514 --> 24:44.414
good or bad.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.815
Adam testified that you tried
calling him after he left the tavern.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.019
That's true.

24:56.094 --> 24:59.461
Phone records indicate that you tried
seven times in 12 minutes.

24:59.531 --> 25:01.897
I was worried about him.
I had reason to be.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.628
You couldn't have known
he'd been in an accident.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.331
We'd had a fight. I wanted
to make sure that he was OK.

25:07.405 --> 25:10.966
If my fiancée was calling me like that,
I'd think it was pretty urgent.

25:11.042 --> 25:14.011
Objection! The witness testified
that she was worried.

25:14.112 --> 25:17.081
One phone call is worried.
Seven in a row is urgent.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.481
Overruled.
But tread lightly, Mr. Stone.

25:20.552 --> 25:24.318
Mrs. Mitchell, why was it so urgent
that you get in touch with Adam?

25:24.422 --> 25:28.119
If he wasn't that drunk and he wasn't
that angry, why were you so worried?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.956
- I don't know...
- You don't know.

25:30.061 --> 25:34.191
Yet you called him once, then again,
then again, then again, then again...

25:34.266 --> 25:37.793
Adam was angry, and he was on the road,
and it was dark and...

25:37.869 --> 25:41.737
- And he'd had too much to drink?
- Maybe. Maybe he did.

25:48.413 --> 25:50.244
Been looking all over for you.

25:50.315 --> 25:53.182
You thought you could avoid me,
but what you don't know,

25:53.251 --> 25:55.219
is that no man on Earth
can hide from me.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.552
I find people. And I don't just find
any people, I find people named...

25:59.624 --> 26:01.148
Stanley Lyme.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.853
Yes!

26:02.928 --> 26:05.488
No. Well, kind of.
See, I found the next best thing.

26:05.597 --> 26:09.055
I found out who Lyme met with
before he disappeared. Wanna know how?

26:09.134 --> 26:10.567
No.

26:10.635 --> 26:13.331
I called Zyre Motors
and spoke to the head of HR.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.566
I asked when Stanley stopped working.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.939
She said the last day he worked
at Zyre Motors was June 12th.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.877
Struck me as funny, 'cause
I remembered that on June 11th

26:21.947 --> 26:25.246
someone here billed Zyre Motors
two hours for "Lemon reversal. "

26:25.317 --> 26:27.478
- Maggie...
- Don't you see? Lemon is Lyme!

26:27.586 --> 26:31.420
Someone here met with Lyme before he
disappeared. And you know who it was?

26:31.489 --> 26:33.184
Martin Posner.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.350
You know that?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.589
Why didn't you tell me?

26:38.663 --> 26:42.360
I told you I looked for Lyme, that
further looking was a waste of time.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.301
So you know Posner met with Lyme
before he disappeared?

26:45.370 --> 26:46.928
Why didn't you do something?

26:47.038 --> 26:50.997
Convince Posner to produce the witness
he went through the trouble of hiding?

26:51.109 --> 26:53.873
What about doing what's right?
What's required by law?

26:53.979 --> 26:57.938
I hate to be the one to tell you this,
we work at Wethersby, Posner & Klein.

26:58.049 --> 27:01.075
We're the guys who beat up
on paraplegics and their wives

27:01.152 --> 27:04.815
when we're not busy making sure
Satan's getting a break on his taxes.

27:04.889 --> 27:08.620
If you think that, then why do you
work here? I thought you had changed.

27:08.693 --> 27:09.785
Why do you work here?

27:09.861 --> 27:13.024
I may be trying to change
and I might not be pulling it off,

27:13.131 --> 27:15.099
but at least I know what this place is.

27:15.867 --> 27:19.735
Occurred to you, you might be a better
lawyer if you saw things how they are

27:19.804 --> 27:21.772
instead of how you wish they were?

27:24.876 --> 27:26.207
Maggie!

28:54.766 --> 28:56.631
I know this is a strange question...

28:56.701 --> 28:58.669
Like you ask any other kind.

28:58.770 --> 29:02.137
Are you, by any chance,
a member of a gospel choir?

29:05.076 --> 29:07.840
Why, yes, I am. All black people are.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.880
Particularly all black women.

29:09.981 --> 29:12.916
We love to raise our hands
and praise Jesus!

29:12.984 --> 29:15.714
- You're being sarcastic now.
- Not just now.

29:15.787 --> 29:18.756
So you're not
in a gospel choir with, say,

29:18.857 --> 29:20.825
a relative of a guy
named Stanley Lyme

29:20.925 --> 29:24.759
who knows where Lyme went
and why no one can find him?

29:24.829 --> 29:26.126
What is this about, Eli?

29:26.197 --> 29:29.098
I'm sorry. I just...

29:30.668 --> 29:32.568
Maggie's right.

29:32.637 --> 29:37.199
I pretend to be this new guy, but...
I'm still pond scum.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.704
Old Eli reared his ugly head
in court today,

29:40.779 --> 29:43.907
savaging a paraplegic victim's wife.

29:43.982 --> 29:47.440
Old Eli, who let Martin Posner
hide a witness

29:47.519 --> 29:49.783
who just might
make the plaintiff's case.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.980
I want to do the right thing, but...

29:55.627 --> 29:58.653
I've waited five years
to hear you say that.

29:59.364 --> 30:03.130
Don't ask me why I know,
or how I know,

30:04.135 --> 30:07.298
but I know where Stanley Lyme is.

30:07.405 --> 30:10.272
- What? How?
- What did I just say?

30:10.341 --> 30:12.571
Do you want to know
where Lyme is or not?

30:16.648 --> 30:18.616
Meet me downstairs in ten minutes.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.274
Our flight leaves in an hour.

30:20.385 --> 30:21.511
Flight?

30:21.586 --> 30:25.283
You were right. And that's
the last time I'm gonna say it, OK?

30:27.091 --> 30:29.958
Hey. I was just thinking
about where we should...

30:30.395 --> 30:31.419
What is it?

30:31.496 --> 30:33.657
I'm sorry, I have to work tonight.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.255
The Zyre Motors trial.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.598
You know I wouldn't cancel
unless it was absolutely necessary.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.331
Should I pack an overnight bag?

30:43.741 --> 30:45.902
I totally understand.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.535
Don't work too hard.

30:48.446 --> 30:49.470
Taylor?

30:50.849 --> 30:53.545
So... no overnight bag?

31:02.126 --> 31:03.150
Still here?

31:03.228 --> 31:07.790
I haven't found anything
that trumps the waiver Jess signed yet.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.297
Nothing proving
Donna intended to stay with Jessica?

31:11.369 --> 31:15.328
I've learned more about lesbian love
than I ever cared to know.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.239
And believe me when I tell you,
that's a high bar.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.503
Hey, you want to grab a drink?

31:24.415 --> 31:26.542
So Stone's out and Dowd's in, huh?

31:26.618 --> 31:29.382
All right, let me clear off the desk.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.479
You're not really this much of a pig.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.322
No, I am. The only woman
I wasn't like this with was Jess.

31:36.327 --> 31:37.988
Pathetic, I know.

31:40.598 --> 31:42.156
No, it's not pathetic.

31:42.934 --> 31:46.267
I know a thing or two
about wanting what you can't have.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.235
If I didn't know him any better,

31:49.307 --> 31:53.038
I'd never believe Stone could
be dumb enough to let you go.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.670
He hasn't.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.678
We're still working things out.

31:58.783 --> 32:00.216
Right.

32:00.285 --> 32:01.650
Let me tell you,

32:01.719 --> 32:05.086
the only thing worse
than losing the love of your life,

32:05.189 --> 32:07.953
is having her find the love of hers.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.026
You're a therapist when she's happy,

32:12.096 --> 32:14.394
a relationship coach when they fight,

32:15.500 --> 32:18.060
a cameraman when they throw a party.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.530
Did you record the shower?

32:23.341 --> 32:27.107
It was a party full of lesbians. There
was no way I wasn't going to record it.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.608
Matt, you gotta get me that tape.

32:31.316 --> 32:33.841
OK, so we know he owns
a surf shack, right?

32:33.918 --> 32:37.979
Maybe we can narrow down the candidates
by posing as surfjournalists, then...

32:38.056 --> 32:40.490
The town's about a block long,
Veronica Mars.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.719
If you're so smart, you find it.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.095
What?

32:52.937 --> 32:54.871
Am I missing something?

32:54.939 --> 33:00.104
I thought the point of me disappearing
was that you guys wouldn't appear.

33:00.178 --> 33:03.477
Yes, but I recently located
my professional conscience.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.914
Well, mazeltov. But that's you.

33:06.017 --> 33:09.680
For me, disappearing wasn't about
conscience, it was about survival.

33:09.754 --> 33:12.484
Zyre Motors put out a hit on you?

33:13.691 --> 33:14.817
Just, ignore her.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.488
You ever see The Insider?

33:18.262 --> 33:20.924
That's a pretty accurate
depiction of what happens

33:20.999 --> 33:22.967
to whistle blowers in this country.

33:25.236 --> 33:28.000
Doing that R.P.E. Was
the biggest mistake I ever made.

33:28.573 --> 33:30.097
What's an R.P. E?

33:30.174 --> 33:32.438
Rollover Propensity Evaluation.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.636
What did you test?

33:33.711 --> 33:37.670
Zyre Motors always tested
their SUV's static stability factor,

33:37.749 --> 33:41.845
that's its risk of rollover,
using cars with optimal tire pressure.

33:43.121 --> 33:45.089
But tires lose air pressure, right?

33:45.189 --> 33:47.157
And you told Zyre Motors about this?

33:47.258 --> 33:50.227
I wrote up a full report
to Mr. Reidy himself. He buried it.

33:51.162 --> 33:54.996
A few months later, I get paid
a visit from a partner at your firm.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.895
He's got a check for two million dollars

33:58.970 --> 34:02.201
and a few suggestions
about how I might wanna spend it.

34:03.374 --> 34:07.310
I'm really sorry you came
all this way. But I won't testify.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.675
I've got a new life now and I'm not
risking it by saying so in open court.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.376
That's all right, Mr. Lyme.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.811
- You don't have to.
- What?

34:16.888 --> 34:20.346
I wrote up a full report
to Mr. Reidy himself. He buried it.

34:20.425 --> 34:24.589
A few months later, I get paid
a visit from a partner at your firm.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.790
He's got a check
for two million dollars

34:27.864 --> 34:31.527
and a few suggestions
about how I might wanna spend it.

34:35.139 --> 34:38.199
I suppose I have two reactions.
The first is, you're fired.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.835
I don't care what piece
of paper Jordan signed.

34:40.911 --> 34:44.074
The second is, we've nothing
to worry about. This is hearsay.

34:44.148 --> 34:45.206
It's inadmissible.

34:45.283 --> 34:49.185
You can't fire me for discharging an
ethical and legal obligation pursuant

34:49.253 --> 34:51.346
to a valid subpoena
and motion to compel.

34:51.422 --> 34:55.358
As for the hearsay issue, out of court
statements can be admissible

34:55.426 --> 34:57.291
where the witness is unavailable.

34:57.361 --> 35:01.422
We don't want to invite an investigation
as to why Mr. Lyme is unavailable.

35:01.499 --> 35:06.266
You're not really blackmailing a partner
of this firm and one of its clients?

35:06.370 --> 35:08.930
"Blackmail" is an ugly word, sir.

35:09.006 --> 35:11.975
A better term, and for all our sakes,
a more accurate one,

35:12.076 --> 35:14.044
is "limitation of liability. "

35:15.113 --> 35:17.877
You have exposure here,
Zyre Motors has exposure,

35:18.950 --> 35:22.113
and I am suggesting a way
to limit that exposure.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.745
Specifically, we settle,

35:24.822 --> 35:27.382
preferably by offering
an amount so substantial

35:27.492 --> 35:31.053
that the plaintiffs
have no choice but to accept,

35:31.162 --> 35:34.859
thus making sure certain
questions don't get asked.

35:39.170 --> 35:42.071
Or you can throw
that recorder in the trash.

35:47.278 --> 35:49.303
I doubt I'll be doing that, sir.

35:53.851 --> 35:57.184
Thank you all so much
for coming to our egg party,

35:57.255 --> 36:00.816
especially those who made
this joyous occasion possible.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.918
But mostly, to Jessica,

36:04.896 --> 36:07.330
for giving me
the most precious of gifts,

36:07.398 --> 36:09.958
literally a piece of herself.

36:10.868 --> 36:15.498
Honey, I want you to know
you will always have my heart.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.871
This was shot
after Ms. Milton testified

36:20.945 --> 36:22.469
that she had gone back to church.

36:22.547 --> 36:26.813
After she claims that she was
having doubts about her relationship.

36:27.451 --> 36:30.113
Seems to me you've got
two choices here, Your Honor:

36:30.188 --> 36:32.952
Give my client equal parental rights...

36:33.958 --> 36:36.290
...or give Ms. Milton an Oscar.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.328
This isn't over yet.

36:38.429 --> 36:41.728
Jeez, Jeff, can I at least get the offer
out before you reject it?

36:41.799 --> 36:44.768
This is what our client
is prepared to settle for.

36:45.803 --> 36:48.829
Five million dollars. Sealed.
We can wire the money today.

36:48.906 --> 36:50.874
The trial's not going that bad for you.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.035
Something's got you spooked.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.134
You wish.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.772
No, Ms. Dekker here prevailed
upon Zyre Motors

36:56.881 --> 36:58.576
to do the right thing.

36:58.649 --> 37:01.117
She can be very persistent.

37:01.185 --> 37:05.849
Ms. Dekker, if you ever decide
to leave this insidious institution...

37:06.424 --> 37:08.255
Thanks, but...

37:10.194 --> 37:12.492
...on Wednesdays they give us muffins.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.670
Looks like we've got a deal.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.931
But I will draft the settlement papers.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.802
Jeff, are you ever gonna trust me?

37:33.551 --> 37:35.178
Muffins?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.744
Well, you wanted to know
why I work here.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.748
There you go.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.588
It's all about the muffins.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.363
You did this.

37:52.336 --> 37:54.861
Don't bother denying it.
I know it was you.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.702
You know what was me?

37:58.442 --> 38:02.674
Do not insult my considerable
intelligence, Patricia.

38:04.682 --> 38:07.446
You told Stone
where to find the engineer.

38:09.987 --> 38:12.649
Haven't you punished me enough?
You barely...

38:12.723 --> 38:15.191
...acknowledged my existence
in five years.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.550
You do realize it's been...

38:19.363 --> 38:21.524
...five years
since you broke up with me?

38:21.632 --> 38:25.659
It's also been five years since Eli
tried this case for the first time.

38:25.736 --> 38:28.364
You ended things between us
because of this case?

38:28.439 --> 38:30.805
Because of what you did in this case.

38:30.908 --> 38:32.671
And I let you.

38:32.743 --> 38:35.644
Because I was falling for you.
So I looked the other way.

38:39.884 --> 38:41.613
Well...

38:43.854 --> 38:45.822
...now that it's behind us...

38:49.126 --> 38:51.094
...do you think there's a chance...

38:52.263 --> 38:54.697
...we could give this,

38:54.765 --> 38:56.323
us...

38:56.400 --> 38:58.095
One more try?

39:01.939 --> 39:04.373
I'm sorry, Martin.

39:06.243 --> 39:07.608
I don't.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.389
All rise.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.027
The law is clear.

39:33.104 --> 39:38.041
The waiver is legally binding, and
the exceptions don't apply in this case.

39:39.143 --> 39:43.705
But the spirit of those exceptions,

39:43.814 --> 39:47.716
that the parties' true intentions
be honored, does.

39:49.453 --> 39:53.719
Accordingly, I find that the intention

39:53.791 --> 39:56.726
of this couple
was to co-parent their baby.

39:57.561 --> 40:02.897
And therefore grant Ms. Benson's
petition for joint custody.

40:03.634 --> 40:08.936
I'm further enjoining Ms. Milton
from leaving the Bay Area.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.208
We're adjourned.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.681
Donna...

40:26.757 --> 40:29.282
I talked it over with my family
and our minister,

40:29.360 --> 40:31.692
and we all agreed
that if this happened...

40:35.199 --> 40:40.136
...it would be best that after the
birth, I just go back home to Ohio.

40:42.573 --> 40:43.597
You mean...

40:43.674 --> 40:46.973
You can have him.
I won't contact you again.

40:48.746 --> 40:49.770
Him?

40:53.117 --> 40:54.379
It's a boy.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.428
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:04.528 --> 41:07.292
The thing with Maggie,
it wasn't what it looked like.

41:07.398 --> 41:10.492
At least we're acknowledging
what it looked like.

41:10.568 --> 41:13.935
Guess it wouldn't help if I said
I'd sooner pull out my nostril hair

41:14.004 --> 41:16.234
than spend six hours
on a plane with Maggie.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.865
Pull out your nostril hair?

41:17.975 --> 41:19.909
Really?

41:19.977 --> 41:24.744
It's not important.
I should never have come to work here.

41:25.583 --> 41:26.675
We'll figure it out.

41:26.750 --> 41:27.910
Will we?

41:28.819 --> 41:31.481
Will I ever really be able
to make you happy, Eli?

41:31.555 --> 41:34.456
Eli, Jordan wants to see you.

41:34.525 --> 41:36.993
He says it won't wait.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.790
Congratulations, Stone.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.928
You wanted to see me?

41:44.001 --> 41:45.969
Morton Reidy, CEO of Zyre Motors.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.766
You know, the man
you extorted into settling,

41:48.839 --> 41:51.399
filed a grievance with the State Bar.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.670
He couldn't do that without admitting
he paid off a witness.

41:55.746 --> 41:59.443
You assume the grievance
was related to Stanley Lyme.

41:59.517 --> 42:03.851
Your literal song and dance in open
court was the basis for his complaint,

42:03.921 --> 42:06.617
calling into question
your fitness to practice law.

42:08.559 --> 42:11.027
I'm not going to like
where this is going, am I?

42:11.095 --> 42:14.531
The Bar appointed a prosecutor
who's learned the Zyre Motors trial

42:14.598 --> 42:16.862
wasn't your only incident.

42:16.934 --> 42:20.870
She's recommended they initiate
disbarment proceedings against you, Eli.
