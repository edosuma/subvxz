(woman)Honey, i'm gonna go

00:39.155 --> 00:41.991
Hey, dad, when you go
up to give your acceptance speech,

00:41.991 --> 00:43.993
do you want me to
stand next to you

00:44.494 --> 00:46.496
and pretend
i'm doing sign language?

00:46.496 --> 00:49.365
Bobby,the blue flame of valor award
is the highest honor

00:49.365 --> 00:52.669
the texas propane gas
association can bestow

00:53.169 --> 00:56.673
upon any current or active
member in peacetime.

00:56.673 --> 00:59.292
(hank)Show some respect.

00:59.292 --> 01:03.296
Uh, mr. Strickland's
wife is beautiful.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.131
(hank)That's not his wife.

01:05.131 --> 01:07.967
(hank)That's debbie from work.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.970
Pretty gal like that
should have been able to get a date.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.305
[People chattering]

01:13.139 --> 01:14.441
[Tapping]

01:14.441 --> 01:16.526
I hope y'all
enjoyed your meal.

01:16.526 --> 01:20.029
I haven't, uh, seen so much chicken in one room

01:20.029 --> 01:22.899
since the democratic
national convention.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.703
Nothing.

01:26.703 --> 01:30.707
Now, the first blue flame
of valor of this millennium

01:31.207 --> 01:36.246
goes to mr. Hank hill
of strickland propane.

01:36.246 --> 01:38.798
(bobby)Yeah. Way to go, dad!

01:38.798 --> 01:40.633
[All applauding]

01:48.224 --> 01:49.225
[Clearing throat]

01:49.225 --> 01:51.144
Thank you.

01:51.144 --> 01:52.645
As a young boy,

01:52.645 --> 01:55.899
i always dreamed
of winning the super bowl.

01:55.899 --> 01:57.901
Then, as most of you know,

01:57.901 --> 02:00.403
that dream was crushed
along with my ankle

02:00.904 --> 02:04.574
in the class 2-a
state football championship.

02:04.574 --> 02:08.077
Well, i knocked around
for a while and sowed my oats,

02:08.578 --> 02:11.080
got a job at jeans west.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.584
Long story short,
one day at j.w.,

02:14.584 --> 02:16.586
i sold a pair of jordache

02:16.586 --> 02:19.589
to a man who would
change my life.

02:19.589 --> 02:23.176
To quote dr. Luther king,
i had another dream:

02:23.676 --> 02:27.180
To sell propane
and propane accessories.

02:27.463 --> 02:28.765
Dr. King.

02:28.765 --> 02:30.016
Mmm-hmm.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.519
the name of the man
and the distributorship

02:32.519 --> 02:35.855
who made me dream again:
Strickland.

02:37.941 --> 02:39.943
The "s" stands for service.

02:40.944 --> 02:43.363
The "t" is for trust.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.481
.
"R" is for reliability

02:46.983 --> 02:47.984
now, the "i" stands for--

02:48.484 --> 02:49.369
(mrs. Strickland)
Jackass!

02:51.120 --> 02:52.205
[Exclaims]

02:52.205 --> 02:54.207
No. No, it's for integrity

02:54.707 --> 02:56.543
that's not even
the right letter.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.546
(man)That's mrs. Strickland.
This ought to be good.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.549
Now, miz liz,just calm down, here.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.833
We-we're in public.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.669
You are in public
with this little bimbo

03:06.669 --> 03:09.505
in front of half
our christmas-card list.

03:10.506 --> 03:13.676
Are those
my mother's earrings?

03:13.676 --> 03:16.179
"C" is for, uh, compassion

03:16.679 --> 03:17.847
i want you out of the house!

03:17.847 --> 03:18.848
Yeah, but, sweetie--

03:19.349 --> 03:20.350

03:20.350 --> 03:21.601
Out of the lake house?

03:21.601 --> 03:23.102
I'm sorry i stole your thunder, hank.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.104
Please, start over.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.525
Uh, hmm... well, uh...

03:32.745 --> 03:34.247
uh, now, where was i?

03:34.247 --> 03:35.748
(man)"D" for done.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.454
Hank, my office, pronto.

03:42.839 --> 03:44.007
??[humming]

03:44.007 --> 03:45.675
Morning, debbie.

03:45.675 --> 03:47.176
Now, we gotta move fast.

03:47.176 --> 03:49.178
Hank, give me whatever cash you got.

03:51.180 --> 03:54.267
Uh-huh, son, you just bought
yourself a barbecue joint.

03:55.134 --> 03:56.636
(hank)"I hereby transfer

03:57.136 --> 04:00.523
100 percent ownership of
sugarfoot's barbecue to hank hill."

04:00.523 --> 04:03.192
Yeah, that's right.
And after my divorce is final,

04:03.192 --> 04:07.113
you'll therefore transfer 100 percent
ownership back to me.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.617
Miz liz can't have 
half of what i don't own,you see?

04:11.117 --> 04:11.618
[Laughing]

04:12.118 --> 04:13.403
You sabe,don't you?

04:13.403 --> 04:15.905
Sir, i didn't even know
you own sugarfoot's.

04:15.905 --> 04:18.908
That place is an institution,
i'll tell you what.

04:18.908 --> 04:21.911
You got your sawdust on the floor

04:21.911 --> 04:24.414
the brisket served up on butcher paper.

04:24.797 --> 04:26.499
Yeah, yeah, dang it, hank,
this ain't poetry night.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.501
Now don't worry.
The place runs itself.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.804
The help makes the barbecue,
i make the money.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.091
Now, go tell, uh,joe jack to come get
his new evinrude outboard,

04:35.591 --> 04:37.393

04:41.147 --> 04:44.651
With the power vested in me
by the great state of texas,

04:44.651 --> 04:47.020
i hereby notarize
this beer coaster.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.821
(peggy)Congratulations, hank.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.907
(peggy)You own
a barbecue restaurant.

04:50.907 --> 04:54.911
And, because we live in
a community-property state, i own half.

04:54.911 --> 04:57.914
So, in addition,
congratulations to me.

05:02.285 --> 05:05.872
Now, listen here, children
. we're a family.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.373

05:22.522 --> 05:26.025

05:26.025 --> 05:28.227
Sticks and stones, buck.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.897
That's all you're
gonna be left with.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.150
Well, you must be 
the adulteress co-respondent in this divorce.

05:34.650 --> 05:35.985
Aren't you pretty.

05:35.985 --> 05:38.988
I see how you could make
a weak man stupid.

05:39.238 --> 05:40.490
[Giggling]
Thank you.

05:40.490 --> 05:44.160
Judge yarborough
sends his best regards, and this.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.046

you gotta leave,which is now,

05:47.046 --> 05:48.548
and where you gotta go
, which is out.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.416
There. You all caught up.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.219
Ah, dang it, miz liz!
Leggo my eggos.

05:53.219 --> 05:56.139
I'm sorry you had to
hear that, miz liz.

05:56.139 --> 05:58.141
Now, you drag
yourself out that door

05:58.641 --> 06:01.844
before my ostrich boot
puts your eggos back in the toaster.

06:02.145 --> 06:03.312
Thank you, jewel.

06:03.312 --> 06:04.814

06:04.814 --> 06:06.816
Debbie, you stay here.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.818
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

06:09.318 --> 06:11.070

06:11.354 --> 06:14.357
Yes, but your butt belongs to me.

Uh, look, mrs. Strickland,
i believe in being direct,

06:27.887 --> 06:31.557

06:31.557 --> 06:34.811
I figure you probably wanna
bring in your own people,and...

06:34.811 --> 06:37.730
my people shop.
Relax, hank.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.984
I and my lawyer want
this business to be profitable.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.903
I can't do that
without you.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.655
I need you on my team.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.608
Hmm. Well, i do love teamwork.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.778
Hank, what's the worst
job on this team?

06:51.778 --> 06:53.780
Worst-paying or most degrading?

06:54.280 --> 06:57.116
Ah, hell, it's the same
for both. Tank wipe.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.786

owner of sugarfoot's.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.615
What happened to mr. Buck?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.619
Oh, mr. Buck is going
through a nasty divorce.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.622
So he sold this restaurant
to me and my husband

07:37.123 --> 07:38.791
who will be a silent partner.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.460

07:40.460 --> 07:41.961
Well, i have not met you yet,

07:41.961 --> 07:44.547

told me your name.

As my first order of business,

08:00.513 --> 08:04.183
i want you to know that
you are no longer employees.

08:05.518 --> 08:09.021
You are now teammates

08:09.021 --> 08:11.824
and i am your captain,peggy hill.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.193

08:25.171 --> 08:26.122
[Birds chirping]

08:28.624 --> 08:29.959
Oh, i'm sorry.

08:29.959 --> 08:32.794
I'm looking for building 25,

08:34.212 --> 08:35.631
Yeah, i'm in here, old top

08:38.967 --> 08:41.470
huh, you know, debbie's place
is right next to sugarfoot's.

08:41.470 --> 08:42.722
That's a coincidence.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.023
No coincidence

08:44.023 --> 08:46.893
i like to eat,i like to hump,
and i don't like to drive.

08:46.893 --> 08:50.062
So i built sugarfoot's
next to the singles complex.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.564
Have a seat.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.121
That's my italian scattergun.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.958
That gun, that saddle,them boots,

09:01.958 --> 09:03.960
one measly box of cash.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.547
That's all i can hide from my wife
and that damn jewel crawford.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.049
Oh, ebay has a smokey and the bandit

09:10.049 --> 09:12.051
screamin' eagle
black trans am hot wheels,

09:13.803 --> 09:16.889
Hey, buck,can i borrow $400?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.257
This is debbie's roommate,laura.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.725
It's gale.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.012
Here's where i'm gonna stick
my "light my firebird."

09:23.312 --> 09:25.314
You're gonna shut up now,
is what you're gonna do.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.317
God dang it!
Are those my pecan sandies?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.570
that was dinner.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.326
Hank, let's do something nice
for our tummies, huh?

09:38.444 --> 09:39.445
[Sighs]

09:43.366 --> 09:45.952
Uh, what would you recommend
if none of this looks good?

09:45.952 --> 09:47.453
Crepes saint jack.

09:47.453 --> 09:48.838
And the florentine for madam.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.122
[Sighs]

09:51.123 --> 09:52.625
I can remember,

09:52.625 --> 09:54.126
barely,

09:54.126 --> 09:56.545
when waiters
didn't call me madam.

09:57.546 --> 09:58.547
[Sobbing]

10:02.134 --> 10:04.470
Uh, uh, looks like
you need a refill.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.891
Oh, hank, i can forgive my husband's benders,

10:09.308 --> 10:10.810
and the profanity,

10:10.810 --> 10:15.114
and his inappropriate comfort
with all aspects of the human body.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.066
But it's the women, hank.

10:17.066 --> 10:20.987
My purse of forgiveness
is finally empty.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.990
Oh, please,
don't make me choose sides

10:23.990 --> 10:25.992
mr. Strickland's
been very good to me.

10:26.492 --> 10:30.413
And i've worked for him as long as he's been
cheating on you.

10:30.413 --> 10:33.416
We both deserve better, hank.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.301
I'd like you to have this.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.721
Hank rutherford hill.

10:38.721 --> 10:42.558
I'm making you manager,
and i'm giving you a raise

10:43.009 --> 10:46.512
wow! Manager?

10:47.013 --> 10:50.016
Well, i--i hope you won't pass
the cost of my raise on to the customer.

10:50.516 --> 10:51.267
[Laughing]You.

10:52.568 --> 10:55.321
Ah, welcome to our
very first team meeting.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.492
Now, this is our
new suggestion box.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.862
It is a way for each of us
to anonymously suggest ways,

11:02.862 --> 11:04.864
we can whip
this place into shape

11:04.864 --> 11:06.866
without fear of losing your job.

11:06.866 --> 11:07.867
[Rattling]

11:08.367 --> 11:09.869
Oh, someone's already
made a suggestion.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.871
This is exciting.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.709
"Sweep out the sawdust
and put down carpet.

11:16.709 --> 11:19.845
Carpettex is having another
going-out-of-business sale."

11:19.845 --> 11:21.130
Excellent. Approved.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.799
You know, that box would
work better if you cut a hole in the top.

11:23.799 --> 11:25.301
Mmm-hmm, possibly.

11:25.301 --> 11:27.803
Now, in addition
to the anonymous suggestion,

11:27.803 --> 11:29.305
I have a few
thoughts of my own

11:29.805 --> 11:31.974
alvin, when customers
walk into sugarfoot's,

11:32.475 --> 11:33.642
What's their first thought?

11:33.642 --> 11:35.561
"i'm hungry" ?

11:35.561 --> 11:38.647
Uh-uh. It's, "why isn't this place good enough
to be a chain?"

11:39.065 --> 11:41.067
Now, my own experience
tells me

11:41.067 --> 11:43.035
that people are willing
to sacrifice individuality

11:43.035 --> 11:45.204
for comfort and familiarity.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.073
And in his autobiography,

11:47.073 --> 11:49.458
wendy's founder
dave thomas agrees.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.911
I like them square hamburgers.

11:51.911 --> 11:56.082
Exactly. Now, everyone,
please open up your chore envelope.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.470
Hello.Oh, hi, mrs. Strickland.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.973
Uh-huh?

12:03.973 --> 12:05.474
A propane emergency?

12:06.475 --> 12:07.426
[Clock chiming]

12:08.427 --> 12:10.312
Come in, hank.There seems to be

12:10.813 --> 12:12.982
A--a propane leak
in the master bathroom

12:12.982 --> 12:15.484
huh. Is it the whirlpool
or the heater?

12:15.484 --> 12:17.486
Huh, you're the professional.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.106
I just know it's not
hot enough in there

12:20.606 --> 12:21.607
yet.

12:21.607 --> 12:22.608
Sounds like the heater.

12:24.527 --> 12:25.361
Huh.

12:29.365 --> 12:31.367
This might be electrical.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.919
I knew you were
the right man for the job.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.422
You know, i gotta be hones
t with you, miz liz.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.758
I was worried when you took over at strickland.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.260
Could you pass me
more of those bath beads?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.762
Oh, sure.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.015
And i didn't wanna have
to leave strickland.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.933
Is that champagne?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.935
And these are 2 glasses.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.520
Huh.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.858
Huh. Uh, yup. A backup glass,
in case one of them breaks.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.894
Hank, let's get in there
and make some soup.

13:01.397 --> 13:03.149

Wait, wait.

13:15.311 --> 13:18.397
(mrs. Strickland)Hank, i am so embarrassed
about last night.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.399
You're a real gentleman,

13:20.399 --> 13:23.068
and i was a little
less than a lady.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.572
I'll try to be
patient with you,

13:26.572 --> 13:28.240
and with my desires.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.528
Uh-uh, well, you know,
there's no personal...

13:32.528 --> 13:34.113
uggh...

13:34.113 --> 13:37.082
it was my fault,and i'm turning
over a new leaf.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.252
Now, here's your
new manager's uniform.

13:40.252 --> 13:43.255
Put it on and let's go
into the showroom.

13:43.255 --> 13:46.258
In recognition of his
dedication to this company,

13:46.258 --> 13:48.761
i have promoted hank hill

13:48.761 --> 13:52.014

Boy-toy? I don't even know
what that means.

14:08.197 --> 14:10.699
It means you're
miz liz's debbie.

14:10.699 --> 14:12.451
Hey.

14:12.735 --> 14:14.737
See you around, debbie.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.208
Judas h. Priest, debbie!

14:19.208 --> 14:20.793
Did you shove
a cat down this drain?

14:20.793 --> 14:24.163
I haven't had time to do
anything except be your wife's slave.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.882
Buck, you gotta do somethin'.

14:26.882 --> 14:28.300
You're on your own, debbie

14:28.300 --> 14:29.635
i can't help you no more.

14:30.052 --> 14:33.055
Well, i'm tired of wipin' tanks all day
to support this home

Now, i am not a history buff,

Debbie, get me
my flip-flops.

[Car engine starting]

14:58.364 --> 15:01.500
Poor peggy,doesn't suspect
a thing about miz liz.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.869
There is nothing to suspect.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.871
I haven't done
anything except my job.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.207
Well, you can kiss
that goodbye

15:08.207 --> 15:10.926
unless you kiss miz li
z in a pleasing manner.

15:11.427 --> 15:14.263
You could call the equal employment
opportunity commission.

15:14.263 --> 15:15.764
Or you could
just put out.

15:15.764 --> 15:17.266
6 of one.

15:17.266 --> 15:20.803
I'm not going to put out,
i'm not going to lose my job,

15:20.803 --> 15:23.889
and i'm not going to let peggy
find out about any of this.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.140
Dale, give me a cigarette.

15:25.140 --> 15:29.645
I thought you quit because
cigarettes cause death.

15:29.645 --> 15:32.147
They do, you know,
so pace yourself.
