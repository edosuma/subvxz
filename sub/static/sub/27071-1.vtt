WEBVTT

01:54.000 --> 01:55.500
Stop it!

01:55.524 --> 01:58.024
Hudson, I don't want them today.

01:58.748 --> 02:00.748
Take them out.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
What the hell?

02:53.200 --> 02:54.500
Shit.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Intruder on the south side.

03:00.024 --> 03:02.524
You stay here.
Go now!

04:36.400 --> 04:38.000
Where is DeMarco?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.500
Wouw!

05:31.300 --> 05:32.800
Hey, man,

05:32.824 --> 05:35.524
whatever they pay you.
I double.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
Non negotiable.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.100
Done. But there was
some collateral damage.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.100
Who?

06:38.100 --> 06:39.600
Just some security staff.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.900
Why?

06:40.900 --> 06:44.600
A third party intervened. I had to engage
sooner than anticipated.

06:45.424 --> 06:46.824
An overlap?

06:46.900 --> 06:48.900
Probably a freelancer.

06:49.324 --> 06:51.324
His status?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Still active.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.300
Regrettable yet acceptable.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.830
I'm forwarding your next
job to your account.

07:03.324 --> 07:05.724
It's the one you have been waiting for.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.900
Understood.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.800
Gotta love Europe.

09:26.424 --> 09:28.424
Everyone has a basement.

09:29.648 --> 09:32.048
Makes it easy to do things like this.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.100
American?

09:34.124 --> 09:35.624
Who are you?

09:35.656 --> 09:37.656
Honestly though;

09:37.700 --> 09:39.700
you oughta clean yours.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.100
It's filthy.

09:44.200 --> 09:48.200
What do you want from me?
I'm just an old hippie.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
I'm here to retrieve something.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.500
Retrieve?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
Why do you tie me up?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.600
Precautionary measure.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
I don't know what you want

10:00.424 --> 10:02.824
but I think it's time for you to go now.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.100
Soon enough.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.100
And set me free.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.148
Oh, I'm afraid I'm going to kill you.

10:09.000 --> 10:09.800
What?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.600
But you knew that when
I knocked you down.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.620
No. Why?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
Do we really need to play this game?

10:18.524 --> 10:20.524
It's the job, old man.

10:21.548 --> 10:23.948
Now would you be so kind
to tell me where it is?

10:24.000 --> 10:28.500
Even if I knew what you want why should I give
it to you when you're going to kill me anyway?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.000
Because...

10:32.124 --> 10:36.124
it will minimize the time
between now and your appending death.

10:36.816 --> 10:38.816
So I implore you

10:38.840 --> 10:40.840
please don't let me die.

10:42.664 --> 10:47.064
I don't have much money in the house now
but you can take all I have.

10:47.088 --> 10:50.788
And I promise you no one
will learn of what has happened here today.

10:50.788 --> 10:53.288
You really oughta stop this charade,
Joseph.

10:53.312 --> 10:55.112
Now tell me where the file is.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.412
What file? I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:57.412 --> 10:59.412
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

10:59.436 --> 11:01.436
The evidence you took.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.960
I need everything from the agency;

11:05.084 --> 11:07.084
contracts, names,

11:07.108 --> 11:09.108
board of directors,

11:09.132 --> 11:11.132
Ronald Smith...

11:11.156 --> 11:13.156
everything.

11:17.180 --> 11:19.680
Did you really think you
could escape your past?

11:23.504 --> 11:24.904
'cause

11:24.928 --> 11:27.928
now it's time to pay for trying.

11:30.028 --> 11:32.528
You're making a terrible mistake.

11:32.552 --> 11:35.052
I am not the man you take me for.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It would be best if you were.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.500
What is this week's progress
report, Mr.Anderson?

11:51.000 --> 11:55.800
Currently we have seven operations
running in Canada, Japan and Russia.

11:55.824 --> 11:59.124
We expect their completion
by the end of the week.

11:59.208 --> 12:02.208
Very well.
Mr. Reeves?

12:02.232 --> 12:06.732
Have we received
the money for the DeMarco order?

12:06.756 --> 12:09.956
It has been credited this morning.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.980
The operative was from your
resort, wasn't he?

12:13.504 --> 12:15.504
A Lucas Kane?

12:15.528 --> 12:24.528
If I remember correctly our operatives and
managers remain deliberately concealed.

12:26.652 --> 12:30.152
Yes. He's my operative.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.876
Why?

12:32.900 --> 12:36.900
According to Kane's report the operation
was intervened by a freelancer.

12:36.924 --> 12:44.724
Which, as you know, jeopardizes the job,
the man on the field and most importantly this agency.

12:45.448 --> 12:50.148
I was just curious why it was
left out of your report, Sir.

12:50.472 --> 12:52.472
If I left it out

12:52.896 --> 12:54.496
I must have my reasons.

12:54.520 --> 13:00.720
Sir, according to chapter four, section one
regulations state that if an operative...

13:00.744 --> 13:08.144
This mission was a success
and I assure you, Jane...

13:08.168 --> 13:10.168
Misses Adler!

13:11.192 --> 13:15.892
...that my operative
was never in danger.

13:15.916 --> 13:17.916
Without a doubt.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.940
Mr. Kane has proven himself very reliable.

13:21.964 --> 13:32.264
Yet, one of the most important tasks of the board is to see to it that jobs like
that do not enter the free market and to prevent overlap.

13:32.288 --> 13:33.688
Correct.

13:33.712 --> 13:34.912
Last month

13:34.936 --> 13:40.636
this agency lost a man on a
mission again under your supervision.

13:40.660 --> 13:45.660
Is there something you'd
like to say, Jane?

13:45.684 --> 13:48.584
I just want to point out
to the people present

13:48.608 --> 13:52.308
that you're only the temporary
director 'til the election

13:52.632 --> 13:54.932
which I will candidate for myself.

14:00.656 --> 14:02.656
How pleasant.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.680
Competition is good for business.

14:05.704 --> 14:09.204
Even if this business is a deadly one.

14:13.128 --> 14:18.928
Very well. Let us get back
to our running operations.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.400
Something strange is going on.

15:00.724 --> 15:01.924
Smith?

15:03.348 --> 15:05.348
It's not only his ambition.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.672
He's hiding something.

15:08.196 --> 15:10.696
Something that would
bring him to his knees.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.720
Then Kane would be our best lead.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.944
He left the country immediately
after the DeMarco job.

15:15.968 --> 15:17.968
So you have to find out where he went.

15:19.392 --> 15:21.892
Give him a new shadow. He's seen your face.

15:22.916 --> 15:26.916
Well done by the way. You
spoiled Smith's day for sure.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.940
Permission to speak freely?

15:33.164 --> 15:35.164
You're the one with the dick in your hand.

15:44.088 --> 15:46.088
Are you sure about all this?

15:46.112 --> 15:49.912
This agency has been
corrupted for too long now

15:50.236 --> 15:53.436
and Smith is just going
to make it even worse.

15:53.460 --> 15:56.460
I want bring it back to
the way it used to be.

15:56.484 --> 15:58.684
So you are free to question me.

15:59.008 --> 16:02.008
But I don't have to explain
myself, Sweetheart.

16:02.032 --> 16:06.432
Our lives are on line here. Just wanna
make sure I'm on the right side.

16:07.856 --> 16:09.856
You're safe with me.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.080
It sure feels that way.

16:13.404 --> 16:20.804
Sometimes you gotta trust your instincts.
Just like I trust your talents.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.100
Once again, Joseph, tell me
where you hid the files.

16:36.100 --> 16:42.000
Once more time; my name is
not Josef; I'm called Karl.

16:42.824 --> 16:46.224
Of course. I understand.

16:46.248 --> 16:49.348
At your age memory can get lost.

16:50.672 --> 16:54.072
But don't worry.

16:54.896 --> 16:56.896
I'll help you find it.

17:05.420 --> 17:09.520
Joseph Kyler, born October 4th, 1953.

17:09.544 --> 17:12.044
Mother died giving birth,

17:12.068 --> 17:14.068
father disappeared soon after.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.592
Grew up in different foster homes,

17:16.616 --> 17:18.915
ran away at age 12.

17:18.940 --> 17:25.040
Travelled all throughout Europe, various casual jobs-
not all of them completely legal.

17:25.763 --> 17:27.763
Recruited in 1981.

17:28.288 --> 17:31.488
The following entries are
counting an impressive profile.

17:31.812 --> 17:36.412
Rapid promotion within our agency,
professional assassinations in various countries.

17:36.736 --> 17:38.736
Never been captured.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.360
According to supervisor Ronald Smith:

17:41.384 --> 17:48.584
He was most likely the greatest capital of our agency
with a line of success that goes back twenty years.

17:52.508 --> 17:54.508
Nice photo.

17:58.532 --> 18:00.832
This person doesn't
look anything like me.

18:00.856 --> 18:02.856
Yeah, right.

18:03.580 --> 18:06.980
At least seven documented plastic
surgeries in two decades.

18:07.804 --> 18:09.271
We've kept record.

18:09.272 --> 18:11.571
You have an answer
for everything.

18:12.995 --> 18:14.995
Paper never lies.

18:15.019 --> 18:17.019
Writers do.

18:18.843 --> 18:20.843
Don't get smart with me, Joseph.

18:22.367 --> 18:28.867
Tell me; what does your clever document
say about the whereabouts of this man?

18:31.491 --> 18:33.491
He was liquidated ten years ago.

18:36.915 --> 18:39.515
Am I understanding you correctly?

18:39.539 --> 18:41.639
You break into my house,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.363
you tie my up,

18:44.387 --> 18:47.487
you ask me silly questions, you beat me-

18:48.411 --> 18:52.411
and all this because you think I
am a man who died ten years ago?

18:53.635 --> 18:56.635
A man with a different
face and a different name?

19:02.059 --> 19:04.859
Tell me; you dream this up all by yourself?

19:09.083 --> 19:11.883
I'm looking for a man who
successfully escaped death.

19:12.307 --> 19:17.907
A man who spent his entire life changing his identity, his
appearance, even altering his voice and yet

19:19.331 --> 19:24.031
he decided not to change one small feature.

19:24.855 --> 19:26.855
A scar on his abdomen.

19:38.479 --> 19:40.479
Hello, Joseph.

19:44.803 --> 19:46.803
Friends call me Joe.

19:48.727 --> 19:50.727
It is an honor.

19:51.551 --> 19:57.251
I must say your file paints
you as a, surprisingly, living legend.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.475
Don't be deluded into
thinking you know who I am.

20:02.799 --> 20:05.599
A dossier doesn't tell you
anything about a man.

20:05.623 --> 20:07.623
It tells me everything
I need to know.

20:07.647 --> 20:10.547
A scar betrays a man.

20:11.371 --> 20:13.371
Scars are history.

20:14.795 --> 20:16.795
And this one,

20:17.719 --> 20:19.719
this one always reminds me

20:20.643 --> 20:22.643
of how it all began.

20:24.967 --> 20:26.967
The woman.

20:27.491 --> 20:29.491
The Woman.

20:33.215 --> 20:35.215
That one woman.

21:50.580 --> 21:53.180
Hey. Do you have a job?

21:56.504 --> 21:58.504
Thanks.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.000
Hey, Baby.

22:20.024 --> 22:21.224
Let me go.

22:21.248 --> 22:22.348
Hey, Baby.

22:22.373 --> 22:22.973
Hey!

22:22.973 --> 22:23.973
Hey!
- Let me go.

22:23.973 --> 22:24.673
Leave her alone.

22:24.673 --> 22:27.373
Leave her alone.
- Piss off.

22:27.468 --> 22:29.468
I said; leave her alone.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.892
I said; piss off!

22:41.016 --> 22:43.016
You piss off!

22:52.340 --> 22:54.740
I have to thank you.
So...

22:54.764 --> 22:55.764
thanks.

22:55.788 --> 22:57.788
Don't worry about it.

22:59.312 --> 23:01.012
Emily.

23:03.136 --> 23:05.636
You were just wondering
what my name was.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.760
Right.

23:08.184 --> 23:11.984
But right now I'm wondering
where I can buy a drink in this town.

23:12.008 --> 23:14.008
Is that so?

23:14.032 --> 23:16.032
Sadly, yes.

23:16.056 --> 23:20.556
Well, then the least I can do is invite
my knight in shining armor to drink.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.980
Really, that is not...

23:23.004 --> 23:25.004
Necessary.

23:33.128 --> 23:35.128
Do I make you nervous?

23:35.152 --> 23:41.852
Hum? Oh, no. I just feel
a bit underdressed.

23:44.176 --> 23:47.276
Okay. Yes, you make
me a bit nervous.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.900
Good.

23:50.424 --> 23:56.724
So, Joe. What is it that you do if
you're not saving damsels in distress?

23:56.748 --> 23:58.748
Right now, I'm
looking for a job.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.772
Aren't we all?

24:01.196 --> 24:06.996
Dunno. I sometimes think that everyone's found
theirs and I'm the only one still searching.

24:07.020 --> 24:09.020
In bars like this?

24:10.644 --> 24:12.644
Even in bars like this.

24:14.868 --> 24:19.168
Maybe it's your search for destiny
that brought you here today?

24:20.392 --> 24:22.392
To the bar?

24:23.216 --> 24:25.216
To me.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.340
Do you sometimes think
about the future?

24:44.564 --> 24:46.564
Not right now.

24:57.488 --> 25:01.027
6 past 1. Not the right
time for the future.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.368
Beautiful watch.

25:07.192 --> 25:09.192
It suits the owner.

25:09.216 --> 25:13.716
Would certainly make my granddad happy
to hear that, if he were still alive.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:15.464 --> 25:19.164
Don't be. He led a long, satisfied life.

25:19.188 --> 25:26.088
He once told me that his hard life 
was fulfilled when he finally arrived?.

25:26.712 --> 25:33.312
I've never asked him what that was supposed
to mean, but he left me the watch.

25:44.036 --> 25:48.236
So? Do you sometimes
think about the future?

25:48.560 --> 25:52.660
Not really. I try to avoid that.

25:52.984 --> 25:54.484
Why?

25:55.908 --> 25:58.208
It just doesn't seem important.

26:17.432 --> 26:19.432
I can't promise you anything.

26:19.756 --> 26:21.756
And I don't expect anything.

26:25.780 --> 26:32.180
No, that's not right, I guess. But...

26:32.204 --> 26:34.704
I don't really know what to expect.

26:35.028 --> 26:41.628
I feel exactly the same way, but
one thing I know for sure.

26:41.652 --> 26:43.652
Which is?

26:43.676 --> 26:46.776
That the future, whatever
it's gonna be like,

26:48.100 --> 26:50.600
now looks far more
promising than yesterday.

26:52.624 --> 26:54.624
You're such a hippie.

27:01.348 --> 27:03.348
Wouldn't it be nice?

27:04.072 --> 27:06.072
To be without prior burdens,

27:07.096 --> 27:11.296
planning your future with
no respect to the past?

27:12.920 --> 27:14.920
Maybe that's possible.

27:16.144 --> 27:17.144
No.

27:18.168 --> 27:20.168
You hardly know me.

27:21.092 --> 27:23.092
I know everything I
need to know about you.

27:25.816 --> 27:27.816
I've a past too, you know.

27:28.140 --> 27:30.140
Maybe you won't like it.

27:30.564 --> 27:32.564
Okay,

27:32.588 --> 27:34.588
how about this idea:

27:35.912 --> 27:42.312
Since we both like the present, we're gonna
savor every single moment of it for tonight.

27:42.936 --> 27:44.936
We forget about the past.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.060
And tomorrow -

27:49.584 --> 27:51.584
we talk about the future.

27:52.608 --> 27:54.608
I'd like that.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.400
I wouldn't do that. Next
time, it's gonna hurt.

29:15.424 --> 29:17.024
Who are you?

29:17.648 --> 29:19.648
A friend.

29:21.272 --> 29:22.572
Police?

29:23.696 --> 29:25.696
Have you called the cops?

29:29.020 --> 29:30.220
I'm Nina.

29:30.244 --> 29:33.344
Consider me a concerned citizen.

29:34.568 --> 29:36.568
I wanna help you.

29:39.092 --> 29:41.092
She's dead.

29:42.616 --> 29:44.616
Emily's dead.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.240
I know.

29:46.264 --> 29:48.264
I can't help her anymore.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.588
But I can help you.

29:52.612 --> 29:55.212
We're gonna take care
of the mess out there.

29:55.236 --> 29:58.136
No one's gonna find her. You're not guilty.

29:59.360 --> 30:04.960
It's just that no one but
me is gonna believe you.

30:08.684 --> 30:13.884
That poor little girl. She lived and
died without leaving any trace.

30:13.908 --> 30:17.508
She did. She did in me.

30:19.532 --> 30:20.632
Good.

30:24.856 --> 30:27.556
What if I gave you the
chance to prove that.

30:28.780 --> 30:31.980
What if I told you who killed Emily

30:32.804 --> 30:34.804
and where to find him?

31:07.700 --> 31:08.900
Come in!

31:14.024 --> 31:15.624
Is that him?

31:15.648 --> 31:17.248
Baron?

31:20.672 --> 31:22.672
Come on,

31:22.696 --> 31:24.696
I really need something.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.020
John sent me!

31:35.844 --> 31:37.844
Hello, my friend.

31:40.668 --> 31:42.668
You got money?

31:51.692 --> 31:57.092
I'm an exceptionally progressive business man
and support women in all kinds of positions.

32:04.316 --> 32:06.316
So, what's your thing?

32:06.340 --> 32:07.840
Girls?

32:07.964 --> 32:09.564
Drugs?

32:09.788 --> 32:11.588
Both?

32:11.612 --> 32:13.012
Guns.

32:14.936 --> 32:16.936
One more move and he's dead.

32:19.160 --> 32:23.160
Tell your boy to put the gun on the ground
and push it away.

32:23.184 --> 32:24.684
Now!

32:25.008 --> 32:28.808
What are you waiting for? You need a
special invitation? You heard the man.

32:33.032 --> 32:35.532
I have no idea what your
problem is, buddy,...

32:35.556 --> 32:39.456
I'm not your buddy. I
was Emily's friend.

32:39.780 --> 32:41.080
Who?

32:41.104 --> 32:43.104
The woman you killed last night.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.828
I didn't kill anyone...

32:46.452 --> 32:48.452
last night.

32:48.876 --> 32:50.076
I've never heard of that...

32:50.500 --> 32:51.900
whatever her name is.

32:51.924 --> 32:53.924
She only owed you a bit of money.

32:53.925 --> 32:57.547
It was her mistake that she accept
it from you.

32:58.171 --> 33:01.171
But it was yours that you
have killed her for it.

33:01.172 --> 33:04.794
Honestly man, I have no fucking
clue who that bitch is.

33:04.818 --> 33:08.418
Last night I was busy. I was
busy doing other things.

33:11.642 --> 33:15.442
I swear I've no idea who
you're talking about.

33:15.466 --> 33:20.866
But I promise you all of this can be forgiven and
forgotten if you just put the weapon down now,

33:20.890 --> 33:23.590
turn your heel and never
show your face again.

33:25.914 --> 33:27.914
That's it. That's it.

33:27.938 --> 33:30.538
You see, we're becoming friends after all.

33:30.962 --> 33:32.962
I guess someone's been
trying to screw me here.

33:32.986 --> 33:34.486
We'll see about that.

33:34.510 --> 33:39.110
But nobody needs to lose their life
just 'cause of some cheap slut.

33:39.134 --> 33:41.134
One man has.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Excellent job.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.024
Emily would be so proud.

34:22.047 --> 34:24.047
Just a few little flaws.

34:28.772 --> 34:33.371
Oh, don't worry, we took care
of the blonde slut outside.

34:34.896 --> 34:40.396
You came here looking for work.
Congratulations. I just found you a job.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.020
Your first payment.
A promising start.

35:11.644 --> 35:14.344
It's a reminder never to show mercy.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.868
You won't be thanked for it.

35:21.992 --> 35:23.992
I appreciate the advice.

35:24.916 --> 35:27.716
And the history lesson. But
that's not why I'm here.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.040
Give me the files, Joseph.

35:30.064 --> 35:31.764
You don't wanna hear
the end of the story?

35:31.788 --> 35:33.788
The files for a quick death.

35:33.812 --> 35:36.112
I got all the time in the world.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.236
Okay.

35:41.860 --> 35:43.460
Tell me;

35:44.584 --> 35:47.084
how did you find
me after all this time?

35:50.508 --> 35:52.508
Crystal ball.

35:56.632 --> 35:57.832
What's your name, kid?

35:58.256 --> 35:59.656
Kane.

35:59.680 --> 36:00.679
- Kane.

36:00.680 --> 36:01.680
Lucas.

36:01.704 --> 36:02.903
- Lucas.

36:03.804 --> 36:05.804
Well, do me a favor, Lucas.

36:06.928 --> 36:08.928
Start with the left.

36:16.852 --> 36:18.852
As you wish.

36:25.176 --> 36:29.876
We're at your disposal any time.
Ciao.

36:32.100 --> 36:35.200
Have you finally decided on
a date for the election?

36:35.924 --> 36:37.924
You haven't got the memo, yet?

36:37.948 --> 36:39.948
No games.

36:40.272 --> 36:43.372
Your skills don't do
your ambitions justice.

36:46.596 --> 36:50.896
Make way for someone else.
It's going to be better for everyone.

36:52.020 --> 36:55.620
Some friendly advice, Jane:

36:56.444 --> 37:02.644
if you pull off another stunt
like that act in the meeting,

37:02.668 --> 37:11.168
you're gonna wish you were waterboarded
compared to what I'm gonna do to you.

37:12.192 --> 37:14.692
That story with the freelancer.

37:15.816 --> 37:19.016
I would bet my mother's pension

37:19.040 --> 37:22.040
that guy was sent by you.

37:22.064 --> 37:24.064
Your mother's dead.

37:24.888 --> 37:26.888
But between you and me...

37:32.012 --> 37:37.512
Your loss of foresight is as good a proof of
your being unsuitable for the director's post.

37:37.536 --> 37:39.536
A jammer?

37:39.560 --> 37:42.060
Who's playing now?

37:42.084 --> 37:43.775
Drop it,

37:44.776 --> 37:48.076
you're gonna come off worse, darling.

37:48.100 --> 37:52.800
I know you sent Kane for an unauthorized
op. Want to comment on that?

37:58.424 --> 38:02.224
You're not bluffing half as
well as you think.

38:03.148 --> 38:07.348
I'm gonna find out, and then
we don't need that election anymore.

38:07.372 --> 38:14.072
Empty threats by a hissing kitty
to a man with a clean slate.

38:14.096 --> 38:21.096
In my playground your stripes
don't turn you into a tiger.

38:21.120 --> 38:25.220
You have no idea
how hard I've worked for that position

38:26.644 --> 38:28.944
and how many people I've killed.

38:35.468 --> 38:41.468
Ah, Darling, you have no idea
how many I've killed

38:41.492 --> 38:46.592
nor how many more I'm prepared to kill.

38:51.916 --> 38:53.516
It's me.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.940
He still won't talk. And
I have made myself very clear.

38:56.964 --> 39:00.564
Evidently not clear enough.

39:00.588 --> 39:14.588
As far as I'm concerned, you can carve him like a roast,
so long as you get me whatever it is he's put aside.

39:14.612 --> 39:19.512
Break his will, whatever it takes.

39:19.536 --> 39:21.536
Is that understood?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.560
Yes, sir.

39:38.784 --> 39:40.784
So, Germany then.

39:41.808 --> 39:43.808
Interesting.

40:18.632 --> 40:20.632
If it makes you feel any better,

40:21.156 --> 40:23.356
it took me a while to notice you.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.780
Who sent you?

40:27.804 --> 40:29.804
The office of tax evasion -

40:31.028 --> 40:33.428
you're behind on your payments.

40:34.452 --> 40:37.352
Guess the IRS is getting
serious these days.

40:39.276 --> 40:41.276
You have a choice.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
We can see who's faster.

40:52.624 --> 40:54.624
I see you read my profile.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Yakuza.

42:19.724 --> 42:21.724
That doesn't change anything.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.348
Their worst nightmare is about
to come true.

42:25.672 --> 42:26.972
All the lies,

42:27.496 --> 42:29.096
the murders,

42:29.120 --> 42:33.420
it all ends. Now. Tonight.

42:42.444 --> 42:44.444
I don't need to threaten you.

42:46.868 --> 42:50.068
You know that I know...

42:52.392 --> 42:57.292
I don't need to threaten you.
You know that I know where your children work,

42:57.716 --> 42:59.716
where your grandchildren go to school.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.540
Hello?

43:08.864 --> 43:12.064
What? Who is this?

43:12.388 --> 43:15.488
Miss Adler, look, I don't know w...

43:16.212 --> 43:17.812
Hello?

43:39.336 --> 43:40.536
You're not from room service.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.560
And I'm not looking
for an autograph.

43:42.584 --> 43:44.584
What are you doing here?

43:44.708 --> 43:46.708
That ain't a real gun, right?

43:46.732 --> 43:47.632
You want to find out?

43:47.656 --> 43:49.656
You're just a fucking actor.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.780
I'm not just an actor.

44:06.504 --> 44:09.204
Everything alright, sir?
I found your bodyguard.

44:09.228 --> 44:11.228
He's dead.

44:11.252 --> 44:13.352
Your security sucks.

44:13.376 --> 44:18.476
Hey wait a minute. Three days stay, changing room
every single night and even a private bodyguard.

44:18.500 --> 44:20.500
Obviously it wasn't enough.

44:21.324 --> 44:24.124
Well, you're right; you
can protect yourself.

44:24.148 --> 44:27.548
No, that's not what this means. It
means we need to beef up security.

44:27.572 --> 44:31.072
Alright. Will be arranged, sir.
Any idea who he is?

44:31.096 --> 44:33.096
No. Yakuza maybe?

44:33.120 --> 44:36.820
I got a phone call.
I was warned by the agency?

44:36.844 --> 44:38.844
Which agency?

44:38.868 --> 44:40.868
It's gonna be your
job to find out.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Good morning, Sunshine.

45:07.024 --> 45:09.324
I thought you've
forgotten all about me.

45:10.948 --> 45:12.948
I've brought you breakfast.

45:13.772 --> 45:16.372
Torture with room service.

45:17.496 --> 45:20.396
It doesn't give me any pleasure
torturing you.

45:21.220 --> 45:22.920
It's the job.

45:27.444 --> 45:29.144
Right.

45:39.668 --> 45:41.668
I'm not your enemy, Joseph.

45:45.092 --> 45:47.092
You are.

45:47.116 --> 45:50.416
You know, when I first got this assignment
I was disappointed.

45:51.040 --> 45:55.940
But I have to say;
you've exceeded all my expectations.

45:56.364 --> 45:58.864
That's why I'd like to offer you an exit.

45:59.288 --> 46:02.088
Just give me the files
that the agency needs.

46:02.112 --> 46:04.112
That's all they want.

46:04.136 --> 46:06.636
They don't have to know
what happens here today.

46:07.260 --> 46:10.060
The case will be closed
and you'll be dead once again.

46:10.584 --> 46:13.784
And you'll live your life
in some far away country.

46:13.808 --> 46:17.208
I don't know. I don't think so.

46:17.532 --> 46:20.232
Live or death - it's
as simple as that.

46:21.756 --> 46:23.756
Good work, Lucas,

46:24.280 --> 46:27.380
really good work, I gotta say.

46:28.204 --> 46:31.004
Fraternization with the enemy,

46:31.028 --> 46:34.428
gain his trust, become his friend

46:34.452 --> 46:36.752
and then offer him a way out.

46:38.276 --> 46:40.676
Except you're forgetting one thing, Lucas.

46:41.600 --> 46:45.100
I've been using this Stockholm Syndrome
tricks since before you were born.

46:46.324 --> 46:48.324
You're so fucking clever.

46:50.148 --> 46:52.148
Fine.

46:53.672 --> 46:56.372
I have as long as it takes to break you.

47:03.996 --> 47:06.296
I wasn't lying about one thing, old man.

47:07.820 --> 47:09.820
I do respect you.

47:10.044 --> 47:13.844
So tell me,
how the hell did you get in this mess?

47:14.368 --> 47:17.068
You were one of the best
killers of your time, if not the best.

47:17.292 --> 47:20.092
You knew exactly what would happen
if you try to get out.

47:20.916 --> 47:22.416
For what?

47:22.440 --> 47:24.540
Some freedom
you knew wouldn't be granted to you?

47:26.464 --> 47:30.364
Once you're in, you can't get out.
That is the way.

47:30.388 --> 47:33.188
Oh, that's something
to be proud of.

47:33.212 --> 47:34.912
Oh, don't give me some morality lesson.

47:34.936 --> 47:37.736
We're not killing innocent
people here, we're killing criminals.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.760
And we're assassins, not murders.

47:39.784 --> 47:41.384
Oh, that's a good line.

47:41.408 --> 47:46.808
The guy that cleans the pool doesn't ask why it's dirty.
He's just glad it is. Gives him purpose.

47:46.808 --> 47:49.208
And that makes it easier for you
to look at yourself in the mirror?

47:49.232 --> 47:51.932
This isn't about me.
- Oh, really, this isn't about you?

47:51.956 --> 47:52.856
I'm nothing like you!

47:52.856 --> 47:53.656
I'm nothing like you!
- Oh no?

47:53.756 --> 47:55.528
Why don't you just give up, old man?

47:55.528 --> 47:58.428
What are you holding onto?
Who the hell are you protecting?

47:58.552 --> 48:03.452
Nobody. And nothing.
Because they are all dead.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.900
You truly exceeded
all our expectation.

48:24.624 --> 48:26.224
I had a good teacher.

48:26.248 --> 48:28.248
And good dispositions.

48:28.272 --> 48:32.872
You can't force talent.
But I knew you had it in you.

48:33.396 --> 48:35.696
So why do you sound like
you're at my funeral?

48:38.220 --> 48:44.620
Today's a big day. Today
we both have to let go.

48:44.644 --> 48:46.644
What? Why?

48:46.668 --> 48:49.068
I've taught you everything I know.

48:49.992 --> 48:51.292
You know the rules.

48:51.316 --> 48:53.316
Yes. A job is a job.

48:53.340 --> 48:58.140
You can't buy life,
but you can buy death. Once in, always in.

49:01.364 --> 49:05.464
If two killers meet, one of
them has to go either way.

49:05.888 --> 49:07.488
In a job like ours,

49:08.212 --> 49:10.212
you might have to fight a duel.

49:10.236 --> 49:13.736
And in a relationship
like the one we're in...

49:13.760 --> 49:16.160
We won't see each other again?
Ever?

49:16.584 --> 49:17.784
No.

49:21.008 --> 49:22.508
So that's...

49:22.532 --> 49:24.532
...your final test.

49:24.556 --> 49:26.556
One of our own is on the hit list.

49:27.580 --> 49:29.880
The death of one killer
through another one.

49:31.304 --> 49:40.804
It's our way to keep the business efficient.
So if you survive a supervisor is gonna contact you.

49:40.828 --> 49:45.728
And you'll get all your future
jobs through him or her.

49:47.252 --> 49:49.252
I understand.

49:50.676 --> 49:52.276
And I'm ready.

49:52.500 --> 49:54.500
I know.

49:56.824 --> 49:58.324
So...

50:00.748 --> 50:02.448
Right.

50:04.172 --> 50:05.872
Thanks for everything.

50:05.896 --> 50:07.596
Honestly,

50:08.020 --> 50:10.320
I don't know where I'd be without you.

50:13.944 --> 50:15.944
You're very welcome.

50:20.368 --> 50:22.368
Take care.

50:25.292 --> 50:27.292
You too.

52:01.716 --> 52:03.716
I should have known.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.740
Don't worry. It
will be over soon.

52:18.164 --> 52:19.564
I'm...

52:19.588 --> 52:22.388
I'm so proud of you.

52:53.312 --> 52:55.912
The damned are doomed
to live alone.

52:58.336 --> 53:00.636
You wanna wash away your sins?

53:00.660 --> 53:03.060
Clear yourself from the responsibility?
Go ahead.

53:03.784 --> 53:06.984
But we are who we are.
We made our decision.

53:07.008 --> 53:09.408
Decisions are based on personal experience.

53:09.432 --> 53:13.132
If everything you experience is a lie
your decisions are gonna be a mistake.

53:13.156 --> 53:14.756
Cut the bullshit.

53:15.380 --> 53:17.380
You're just a paranoid old man.

53:17.704 --> 53:20.804
The agency is not a charity,
I don't delude myself into thinking that.

53:20.828 --> 53:23.528
But we do not kill for personal reasons.

53:23.552 --> 53:24.276
Why then?

53:24.276 --> 53:26.276
Why then?
- Because we can.

53:26.700 --> 53:33.000
Yes. And they thrust a weapon into our hands, because
they know we'll use it. And that's how they use us.

53:33.124 --> 53:34.248
No. We're professionals.

53:34.248 --> 53:36.248
No. We're professionals.
- C'mon, kid.

53:36.472 --> 53:39.572
How did they ever get owe
to you in the first place?

53:39.596 --> 53:41.896
They didn't put out a want ad, did they?

53:41.920 --> 53:46.420
They offer you revenge? Immunity?

53:47.344 --> 53:49.644
And haven't you learnt to like what you do?

53:49.668 --> 53:52.668
Or have you just gone void inside?

53:52.692 --> 53:54.292
Shut up!

53:54.316 --> 53:56.116
I'm not listening to a traitor.

53:56.140 --> 53:58.340
A traitor? And
whom did I betray?

53:58.364 --> 53:59.264
You know who.

53:59.288 --> 54:00.588
Refresh my memory.

54:00.612 --> 54:05.312
You broke every rule you swore to live by when teamed up
with Charles Russell to take out the director himself.

54:05.336 --> 54:06.060
What?

54:06.060 --> 54:07.260
What?
- It's written down.

54:07.284 --> 54:09.284
But you missed your target,

54:09.308 --> 54:11.508
and signed your own death warrant.

54:12.332 --> 54:15.032
Did you know the eliminated
Russell the very next day?

54:15.356 --> 54:17.556
He just couldn't cover his tracks.

54:17.580 --> 54:20.280
Smith discovered the link right
after they took you out.

54:21.304 --> 54:24.904
The interrogation was... brief.

54:25.528 --> 54:27.728
Why am I not surprised?

54:28.752 --> 54:33.452
And Smith went from assistant
to manager.

54:33.776 --> 54:36.176
And what position does he occupy now?

54:36.400 --> 54:37.900
I don't know what you're saying.

54:37.924 --> 54:39.424
You know exactly
what I'm saying.

54:39.448 --> 54:42.748
You lost, old man. Now you're just
trying to talk your way out of it.

54:43.772 --> 54:45.772
Why couldn't you just stay dead?

54:46.296 --> 54:49.196
You knew Smith would send somebody
when you tried to blackmail him.

54:49.220 --> 54:51.920
And you know you're not
the first one he sent?

55:26.344 --> 55:29.044
Finally. It's done?

55:30.468 --> 55:34.868
It sure is. You know
how reliable I am.

55:37.192 --> 55:38.792
Joseph.

55:38.816 --> 55:40.416
Who did you expect?

55:40.440 --> 55:47.740
I expected for you to
finally fulfill your file status.

55:47.764 --> 55:55.864
There was no body back then and
I hate unanswered questions.

55:58.388 --> 56:07.088
Then I got the DNA-analysis.
Like a ghost from the past.

56:08.412 --> 56:12.012
Couldn't you just have dropped it?
After all these years.

56:15.036 --> 56:17.036
It's a new age.

56:17.660 --> 56:19.960
The old king is dead.

56:19.984 --> 56:26.584
What you couldn't accomplish back
then has now come true.

56:26.608 --> 56:33.208
Guess who's going to ascend
to the throne next.

56:34.932 --> 56:37.932
Who cares?
I'm retired.

56:41.656 --> 56:43.656
That doesn't matter.

56:44.480 --> 56:47.080
You're a risk I cannot take.

56:47.504 --> 56:51.204
Then I just have to screw up your day
even more than I already have.

56:51.628 --> 56:55.728
Ten years ago, I didn't leave empty-handed.

56:55.752 --> 56:58.052
What are you saying?

56:58.076 --> 57:04.076
I'm saying that you and the whole agency are
gonna be done for if this material gets published.

57:04.900 --> 57:10.100
You can consider this my insurance policy,
which I am now cashing in.

57:10.724 --> 57:16.583
You're bluffing. You'd be
incriminating yourself with that.

57:16.607 --> 57:17.907
Don't dare me.

57:18.231 --> 57:20.631
You have a lot more to lose than I do.

57:22.555 --> 57:25.955
You know, Smith,
I might still be an old lion,

57:25.979 --> 57:29.279
but it's kinda foolish to send
a young cub into my cage.

57:29.303 --> 57:35.403
Drop it, or I promise I will tear apart every single
one who's dumb enough to come here on your order.

57:35.827 --> 57:38.927
And after that, I'll come after for you.

57:56.951 --> 57:59.951
See? That was your second mistake.

58:00.675 --> 58:02.775
Smith is gonna be the
new director, you know?

58:04.299 --> 58:06.299
How did you think he'd react?

58:06.323 --> 58:10.723
I thought he'd be wise enough to let
the matter drop. My message was clear.

58:15.547 --> 58:18.047
Why was that my second mistake?

58:21.571 --> 58:23.171
You donated blood two month ago.

58:23.195 --> 58:24.595
Yeah.

58:24.619 --> 58:27.919
Smith simply matched your
DNA with the local database.

58:27.943 --> 58:30.343
Welcome to the digital age, old man.

58:34.467 --> 58:38.667
By the way: you just admitted to
possessing the material I need.

58:40.291 --> 58:44.391
Doesn't it feel liberating
to finally tell the truth?

58:45.715 --> 58:48.515
You wouldn't know the truth
if it bit you in the face.

58:48.539 --> 58:52.639
Wrong. The truth is my friend.

58:52.963 --> 58:54.963
It's gonna be your friend, too.

59:04.287 --> 59:06.287
A truth serum?

59:10.211 --> 59:12.211
Just a little prick.

59:21.235 --> 59:22.735
Talk to me.

59:23.759 --> 59:26.459
The signal has been gone. Our
man has been blown for sure.

59:29.383 --> 59:30.483
Ma'am?

59:32.807 --> 59:35.107
It doesn't matter what Kane is doing there.

59:35.131 --> 59:39.331
Whatever it is, it's definitely
doing harm to Smith,

59:39.355 --> 59:43.055
otherwise Kane wouldn't be there
below the radar.

59:43.079 --> 59:45.879
Put together a Cleaner Unit.

59:45.903 --> 59:49.803
Discretely but as fast as possible.

59:51.427 --> 59:54.727
Kane shall not return home.

59:55.551 --> 59:58.151
Kill everyone who's with him.

59:58.775 --> 01:00:00.775
Understood.

01:00:05.099 --> 01:00:07.099
Gotcha!

01:00:28.323 --> 01:00:30.323
The serum looks like it's taken effect.

01:00:32.347 --> 01:00:36.147
Now for the last time, Joseph:
where are the files?

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:39.971
There aren't any files.

01:00:40.995 --> 01:00:44.395
So disappointing. We're
going in fucking circles.

01:00:44.419 --> 01:00:47.719
No. We're going backwards.

01:00:50.443 --> 01:00:53.343
Stop it, old man, now
tell me the truth!

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:58.267
The truth is that
Smith is a scourge.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:00:59.691
This is not about him.

01:00:59.715 --> 01:01:06.515
Yes it is. It's not about you,
it's not about me. It's about him.

01:01:09.739 --> 01:01:11.739
Speak of the devil...

01:01:20.163 --> 01:01:22.563
Your last update is overdue.

01:01:22.587 --> 01:01:25.187
There's nothing new to report.
He won't succumb.

01:01:25.211 --> 01:01:29.011
Don't get yourself ensnared.
He's playing with you.

01:01:29.535 --> 01:01:32.035
Funny. He says the
same thing about you.

01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:37.659
Don't let him into your head.
Never forget whom you're facing.

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:41.683
How could I?

01:01:41.707 --> 01:01:45.507
Then prove your talent
for improvisation.

01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:46.931
Sir?

01:01:46.955 --> 01:01:50.455
If he won't cooperate, eliminate him.

01:01:50.479 --> 01:01:56.379
Erase him from the surface of this planet.
Once and for all.

01:01:56.903 --> 01:01:58.403
Understood.

01:02:01.127 --> 01:02:03.527
Ready for some more truth?

01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:08.851
This is your last chance.

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.875
The drug should make it easier on you.
Come on.

01:02:11.499 --> 01:02:14.899
It's a truth serum,
not show and tell.

01:02:14.923 --> 01:02:19.023
Joe, I admire your perseverance.
But we're at the end of the line.

01:02:19.547 --> 01:02:21.047
Jepp.

01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:27.871
Fine. Then it's time
for you to die.

01:02:28.395 --> 01:02:31.795
But I'm already dead.
Don't you remember?

01:02:31.819 --> 01:02:35.819
Right. Killed in action.
It's all in the report.

01:02:35.843 --> 01:02:39.043
Don't you wanna hear the rest of the story?

01:02:40.767 --> 01:02:43.067
I think you deserve to know how it ends.

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:51.691
Why not?

01:02:58.215 --> 01:03:00.215
Well...

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:33.539
Sorry to weak you.
But they wanted a natural death.

01:03:34.063 --> 01:03:36.563
You know, dies in his sleep. Classic.

01:03:36.587 --> 01:03:38.887
Are you nuts? What are
you talking about?

01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:41.311
Shhht. I'm here to kill you.

01:03:42.635 --> 01:03:47.735
Now, you can still die a peaceful
death in your sleep.

01:03:47.759 --> 01:03:50.459
The toxin doesn't leave any traces.

01:03:51.283 --> 01:03:55.183
It works immediately and
it won't hurt at all. I promise.

01:03:56.507 --> 01:04:01.607
My security staff are everywhere.
You won't get out of here alive.

01:04:01.631 --> 01:04:05.631
We'll see about them. You
can inject it yourself.

01:04:06.855 --> 01:04:08.855
Not a chance.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:16.179
Well then you force me to choose
a rather messy alternative.

01:04:16.803 --> 01:04:19.203
You have no idea whom you're facing?

01:04:19.227 --> 01:04:22.027
I, however, know exactly who you are,

01:04:23.051 --> 01:04:25.051
Joseph Kyler.

01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:32.175
That's pretty good. But it doesn't change
anything. Now take the fucking syringe.

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:34.199
You unthankful bastard!

01:04:34.223 --> 01:04:37.923
I created you! You were
nobody when we found you.

01:04:38.047 --> 01:04:42.947
Aimlessly wandering about without
making any use of your potential.

01:04:43.971 --> 01:04:47.971
The agency
gave you a purpose.

01:04:48.895 --> 01:04:52.295
A goal.
And a huge load of money!

01:04:52.719 --> 01:04:57.519
And now you're standing here threatening me
in my own bedroom with a fucking gun?

01:04:58.043 --> 01:05:00.043
You're one of us?

01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:02.067
I breed guys like you.

01:05:02.091 --> 01:05:04.591
You work for a supervisor who
works for a manager

01:05:04.615 --> 01:05:06.615
- and that man works for me.

01:05:06.639 --> 01:05:08.639
The director of the agency.

01:05:08.663 --> 01:05:13.863
Oh no. No. I am the agency.

01:05:18.387 --> 01:05:20.387
I told you to be quiet.

01:05:21.211 --> 01:05:23.211
Who sent you?

01:05:23.235 --> 01:05:27.835
It seems someone wants
to make his way to the top.

01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:32.059
Clever, I admit, to send
one of my own men to kill me.

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:37.483
But who? Russell?
Or the new guy, Smith?

01:05:37.507 --> 01:05:39.107
Does it matter?

01:05:39.131 --> 01:05:40.631
That depends.

01:05:40.755 --> 01:05:42.755
Someone will have to pay for this mess.

01:05:44.879 --> 01:05:46.879
Doesn't have to be you.

01:05:47.503 --> 01:05:49.503
So give me a name.

01:05:49.727 --> 01:05:51.727
Who manipulated this job?

01:05:51.751 --> 01:05:53.751
Who made me the target?

01:05:54.675 --> 01:05:55.775
Who used you?

01:05:55.799 --> 01:05:56.799
Nobody used me!

01:05:56.823 --> 01:05:58.223
Nobody used me!
- Oh come on, Joseph.

01:05:58.247 --> 01:06:00.247
Of course we did. From the first day.

01:06:00.771 --> 01:06:02.771
Or do you believe in love
at the first sight?

01:06:04.695 --> 01:06:06.695
You know what you should believe in?

01:06:07.619 --> 01:06:09.619
A good staging.

01:06:25.543 --> 01:06:27.743
I wanna offer you a
deal, sweetheart.

01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:33.067
Well, who am I to turn
down a good deal?

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:39.291
Not that kind of deal...
At least not for me.

01:06:39.315 --> 01:06:41.315
What do you mean?

01:06:41.339 --> 01:06:43.339
I got an eye on a young man.

01:06:43.563 --> 01:06:46.463
You should be just his type.

01:06:47.487 --> 01:06:51.587
I'd like to provide him
with the love of his life.

01:06:52.311 --> 01:06:53.911
For a good fee.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.935
Consider it a kinda role play.

01:06:57.459 --> 01:07:00.159
And a lucrative one, too.

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:05.683
You won't have to do this job
ever again afterwards.

01:07:12.207 --> 01:07:13.807
Promise.

01:07:20.431 --> 01:07:22.431
You piss off!

01:07:31.155 --> 01:07:33.155
Good job.

01:07:55.879 --> 01:07:59.679
Well done. The sleeping
medication has taken affect.

01:08:00.903 --> 01:08:02.603
What're you planning
to do with him?

01:08:02.627 --> 01:08:09.127
Oh, you needn't rack your cute little
brains 'bout that.

01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:11.451
Your job is almost done.

01:08:12.175 --> 01:08:17.375
I... I don't want anything to do with
this anymore. He was nice to me and...

01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:20.099
Was the sex that good?

01:08:20.122 --> 01:08:22.122
You needn't worry about him.

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:24.546
We got big plans for him

01:08:25.171 --> 01:08:29.371
and we're gonna do the best we
can to revenge your murder.

01:08:31.095 --> 01:08:32.395
My murder?

01:08:32.419 --> 01:08:34.019
Yes.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.042
Haven't I mentioned that?

01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:42.267
Joe, wake up! Wake up! Joe!
Come on, wake up!

01:09:18.491 --> 01:09:19.890
No.

01:09:20.515 --> 01:09:23.314
Oh, yes, Joe. Face it.

01:09:24.139 --> 01:09:25.839
You killed her.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.763
Emily.

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:29.487
Guilty as charged.

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.911
And that Baron guy...

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:36.835
...was your first job, but didn't have anything
to do with the death of your little girlfriend.

01:09:37.259 --> 01:09:40.059
But if it makes you feel better,

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:43.082
he got what he deserved.

01:09:46.907 --> 01:09:48.907
We took care of your girlfriend.

01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:51.930
Gave her a nice, anonymous funeral.

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.755
She deserved it.

01:09:55.579 --> 01:09:57.879
We're not complete monsters after all.

01:09:59.003 --> 01:10:01.603
So, what's next?

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:07.327
It's over.

01:10:07.951 --> 01:10:09.955
Here and now.

01:10:24.479 --> 01:10:27.079
Finished. We're through.

01:10:32.903 --> 01:10:35.503
You can't quit just like that.

01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:38.727
Oh, I can. And I did.

01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:42.151
Who do you think you are?

01:10:42.375 --> 01:10:45.275
You have no free will, you son of a bitch.

01:10:46.099 --> 01:10:48.699
You're a puppet.
And I'm the puppet master-

01:10:48.723 --> 01:10:51.623
and I pull all the strings.

01:10:52.747 --> 01:10:54.747
Now dance!

01:10:57.071 --> 01:10:59.071
Took you long enough.

01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:05.395
Well played.
But now the game is over.

01:11:06.119 --> 01:11:08.619
And don't expect mercy
because you didn't shoot.

01:11:09.243 --> 01:11:11.643
I didn't know you knew the
meaning of that word.

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.667
Oh, what a pitty.

01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:16.991
I almost granted you the injection,

01:11:17.715 --> 01:11:19.715
but you tried being funny.

01:11:26.439 --> 01:11:28.639
One last chance.

01:11:28.663 --> 01:11:30.663
Who sent you?

01:11:33.187 --> 01:11:35.987
No matter.
I'll find him.

01:11:37.611 --> 01:11:40.011
Tie him carefully
and throw him into the river.

01:11:44.835 --> 01:11:47.635
You'll find your resignation at the bottom.

01:11:49.459 --> 01:11:51.459
File closed.

01:11:58.483 --> 01:12:01.483
I get it. You were fucked.

01:12:01.807 --> 01:12:03.807
Well put.

01:12:03.831 --> 01:12:05.531
I'm sorry, old man.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:09.955
Don't be. You're in no better shape than
I am. You just don't realize it yet.

01:12:09.979 --> 01:12:11.979
Don't compare yourself to me.

01:12:12.803 --> 01:12:14.803
It's over.

01:12:17.127 --> 01:12:21.227
I have to tell you this is not
gonna be a joyful experience for me.

01:12:25.551 --> 01:12:27.551
I do have to ask you one thing though:

01:12:28.575 --> 01:12:30.575
who saved you from the river?

01:12:30.599 --> 01:12:31.500
Nobody did.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.722
Nobody did.
- Ah, come on.

01:12:32.823 --> 01:12:34.823
Remember the truth serum?

01:12:34.847 --> 01:12:36.947
You couldn't have survived by yourself.

01:12:36.971 --> 01:12:42.171
Well, in our business, it's often in the little
talents that decide between life and death.

01:12:42.695 --> 01:12:48.995
Now I happen to have spent several
months with a very apt...

01:12:50.019 --> 01:12:52.019
escape artist.

01:13:07.743 --> 01:13:09.743
Your cell phone.

01:13:09.767 --> 01:13:13.067
And get rid
of that knife in your sock.

01:13:13.591 --> 01:13:15.591
The cell phone is in my jacket.

01:13:24.615 --> 01:13:27.015
Don't worry, kid, you didn't
stand a chance anyway.

01:13:28.139 --> 01:13:30.139
You had this all planned out?

01:13:30.563 --> 01:13:31.963
Yes.

01:13:31.987 --> 01:13:33.487
What the hell for?

01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:39.611
Well see this little bird whispered in my ear
that Clemens is gonna vacate his chair.

01:13:40.435 --> 01:13:44.535
So I donated blood and Smith took the bait.

01:13:44.559 --> 01:13:48.759
And after they sent this
flunky they had to send someone like you.

01:13:48.783 --> 01:13:50.983
I mean you're good.

01:13:51.007 --> 01:13:56.207
You're really good. You do everything by the book,
even interrogated me in my own house.

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:58.231
Oh god, that's what
you're aiming at.

01:13:58.255 --> 01:14:00.255
So I bugged everything.

01:14:01.079 --> 01:14:03.079
The house, the shed,

01:14:03.903 --> 01:14:07.003
even got one in my shoe.

01:14:07.427 --> 01:14:09.427
I was telling the truth.

01:14:09.751 --> 01:14:12.051
I was telling the truth the whole time.

01:14:12.075 --> 01:14:14.475
There's never been any evidence.

01:14:14.499 --> 01:14:17.799
Not until you got here and
we recorded it together.

01:14:17.823 --> 01:14:22.123
Digitally.
Straight to an external memory.

01:14:22.947 --> 01:14:25.947
Even if you had killed me,
it would have gone public.

01:14:25.971 --> 01:14:28.671
Welcome to the digital age, kid.

01:14:41.895 --> 01:14:43.895
Fuck you.

01:14:46.619 --> 01:14:48.619
It has begun.

01:14:49.743 --> 01:14:51.743
Come on, Lucas.

01:14:57.867 --> 01:14:59.567
What the fuck?

01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:01.591
It's over.

01:15:01.615 --> 01:15:05.315
Knocking really isn't part
of your manners, is it?

01:15:05.339 --> 01:15:10.139
Don't wait for your protégé.
I just sent a team to clean up his mess in Germany.

01:15:10.963 --> 01:15:13.363
I'll finish your whole cover-up.

01:15:13.787 --> 01:15:17.687
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:20.011
Drop it. You were sloppy.

01:15:20.635 --> 01:15:26.835
As far as I'm concerned, you were nothing else but lucky
that nobody's ever found out the truth 'till now.

01:15:26.859 --> 01:15:28.859
Hands off.

01:15:31.883 --> 01:15:33.583
Honestly,

01:15:34.307 --> 01:15:38.807
you've tried to do away with your
boss and used one of our boys.

01:15:39.231 --> 01:15:40.331
Why?

01:15:40.355 --> 01:15:43.455
There are many reasons to kill a man.

01:15:43.479 --> 01:15:48.079
Money is the most honest among them.

01:15:48.103 --> 01:15:52.103
And we have the resources.

01:15:52.127 --> 01:15:54.127
And then you screwed it up,

01:15:54.151 --> 01:15:57.351
and then wait ten years
until he dies without help?

01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:59.975
As I said: you were sloppy.

01:15:59.999 --> 01:16:02.899
I might be many things -

01:16:02.923 --> 01:16:05.523
but not sloppy.

01:16:05.947 --> 01:16:13.547
My second try was a bit more...
timely.

01:16:13.571 --> 01:16:15.071
Poison?

01:16:15.095 --> 01:16:18.695
Administered over many months.

01:16:20.019 --> 01:16:25.019
If anyone was ever to detect it...

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:33.143
Well, let's just say, since everybody is aware
of your overambition by now,

01:16:33.167 --> 01:16:39.167
you will serve as the perfect scapegoat.

01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:42.091
As Russell did.

01:16:42.715 --> 01:16:44.715
Clever.

01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:51.939
Well, then, I have no choice than to
finish off this ill-fated chapter myself.

01:16:51.963 --> 01:16:58.863
See, that's exactly what
makes you sloppy, Jane.

01:16:59.287 --> 01:17:07.087
You should have considered
more carefully who to screw.

01:17:13.711 --> 01:17:15.211
You're serious?

01:17:15.235 --> 01:17:17.535
I'm just trusting my instincts.

01:17:17.559 --> 01:17:25.159
Loyalty is something wonderful 
- if you know whom it's dedicated to.

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:31.483
Okay. Please. Shoot me,

01:17:31.507 --> 01:17:34.807
so I don't have to
bear listening to this farce any longer.

01:17:35.231 --> 01:17:40.131
Don't worry. That was
the plan all along.

01:17:45.555 --> 01:17:47.555
Sorry for the mess.

01:17:48.579 --> 01:17:51.879
Please. I wanna go home.

01:17:52.603 --> 01:17:54.603
My wife and I are expecting a child.

01:17:54.627 --> 01:17:57.027
Oh, it must be nice to
go home to somebody.

01:17:59.351 --> 01:18:02.651
What are you gonna do if your
plan fails and Smith gets away?

01:18:02.675 --> 01:18:04.675
Someone's gonna pay the price.

01:18:04.699 --> 01:18:06.699
Smith' days are numbered.

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.923
If I don't get him the competition will.

01:18:10.247 --> 01:18:12.247
As for you, my friend...

01:18:16.371 --> 01:18:21.271
Fuck! Fine! You want your revenge?

01:18:22.295 --> 01:18:24.695
Then shoot me! I'm right here,
kill me now!

01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:27.119
Don't you remember, I don't kill anymore.

01:18:27.543 --> 01:18:29.543
I renounced my job.

01:18:29.767 --> 01:18:33.567
Why should I go back in my work for somebody
who I've actually grown fond of?

01:18:33.891 --> 01:18:35.891
Big words, old man.

01:18:36.615 --> 01:18:38.915
You know they're gonna send a purging team.

01:18:38.939 --> 01:18:41.239
So I've no chance of
getting out of here alive.

01:18:42.463 --> 01:18:44.063
They're killing me anyway.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:46.087
No, it doesn't look good, kid.

01:18:47.311 --> 01:18:50.511
But you think of something. Improvise.

01:18:50.535 --> 01:18:53.535
Use what the agency told you.

01:18:54.059 --> 01:18:56.859
And think of your wife and
your little family.

01:18:59.283 --> 01:19:01.283
Bye, Lucas.

01:19:03.607 --> 01:19:06.307
Joe! Joe!

01:19:08.031 --> 01:19:10.031
Joseph.

01:19:11.155 --> 01:19:13.155
Joe!

01:19:14.679 --> 01:19:16.679
Joe!

01:19:33.303 --> 01:19:35.703
I was getting worried, Lucas.

01:19:36.327 --> 01:19:38.327
Still not dead.

01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:42.251
Joseph...

01:19:42.275 --> 01:19:44.875
Must be some kind of deja-vu for you.

01:19:46.399 --> 01:19:49.699
That reminds me, congratulations
on your promotion.

01:19:50.523 --> 01:19:52.523
After all,

01:19:52.547 --> 01:19:55.647
you've had a hard long job
killing people to get there.

01:19:55.671 --> 01:19:58.171
But in the end, we've both
got what we wanted.

01:19:58.195 --> 01:20:00.795
What happened to Lucas?

01:20:00.819 --> 01:20:03.419
As if you've ever cared
about a life but your own.

01:20:04.243 --> 01:20:07.543
Maybe your cleaners can tell you that.
I'm sure you've called them already.

01:20:08.367 --> 01:20:15.167
I doesn't matter how long
it takes or where you hide;

01:20:15.191 --> 01:20:18.391
no bounty will be too high,

01:20:18.415 --> 01:20:25.115
no pit which you crawl into
will be deep and dark enough.

01:20:25.139 --> 01:20:33.639
And if you die before I find you,
I will chase you into hell.

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:38.863
If there is still hell,
we both deserve it.

01:20:38.887 --> 01:20:41.287
Save me a seat when you get there.

01:20:43.311 --> 01:20:49.111
Oh, you won't have to bury me
any time soon, my old friend.

01:20:49.135 --> 01:20:55.435
No. Your highly esteemed colleagues take care
of that as soon as they've seen the material.

01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:57.059
The... what?

01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:58.483
You heard what I said.

01:20:58.507 --> 01:21:00.607
Lucas said there was none.

01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:08.131
Whatever it is, you will not be able
to broadcast it fast enough to...

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.155
You're wrong again.

01:21:10.179 --> 01:21:13.179
These are fast-moving times,
my friend.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:17.803
Surely it's gone viral by now.

01:21:18.727 --> 01:21:20.727
No way to stop it.

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:24.051
You bloody bastard.

01:21:24.075 --> 01:21:30.375
What makes you
think you were any better than me?

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:32.799
I am what you made me, Smith.

01:21:33.523 --> 01:21:37.823
Doesn't the creature always end up
turning on its creator?

01:21:38.847 --> 01:21:40.847
But I have to thank you.

01:21:41.371 --> 01:21:46.071
I thought that laying down the gun would bring me peace
but I was a fool.

01:21:46.595 --> 01:21:50.795
Apart from death, what else could
grant the creature redemption?

01:21:56.019 --> 01:22:00.419
You are dead.

01:22:01.443 --> 01:22:04.743
Can you hear me,
you son of a bitch?

01:22:05.567 --> 01:22:07.567
You are...

01:22:18.791 --> 01:22:20.791
...dead.

01:22:37.515 --> 01:22:39.515
Can I get you anything else?

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.839
No thanks. I'm good.

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:50.363
Keep it.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.900
Mr. Wilson, take a look at this.

01:24:38.624 --> 01:24:42.824
So it's true. The hitman
agency actually exists.

01:24:42.848 --> 01:24:46.648
Indeed. This material can be found
everywhere on the internet now.

01:24:46.672 --> 01:24:47.774
How can that be?

01:24:47.796 --> 01:24:49.296
How can that be?
- I have no clue.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:53.320
With this information being public the authorities
will take them out in a blink of an eye.

01:24:53.344 --> 01:24:55.644
Well, make sure the police get
this as soon as possible.
