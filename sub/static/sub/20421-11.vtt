00:09.220 --> 00:10.640
Catch your breath.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.740
East, huh?

00:15.200 --> 00:18.350
Hey, have you ever seen an adventurer?

00:19.930 --> 00:21.040
I heard a rumor

00:21.040 --> 00:26.620
that an adventurer younger than me skipped 
right over this mountain, humming a tune.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.440
If I could be like that...

00:29.440 --> 00:30.270
Don't bother.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.820
What can they do?

00:32.820 --> 00:35.080
Can they live as one with the land?

00:35.980 --> 00:38.270
Adventurers create nothing.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.720
They simply fight and shed blood.

00:43.100 --> 00:43.950
What's wrong?

00:54.080 --> 00:55.610
That looks bad.

00:55.610 --> 00:57.440
We have to tell the village.

02:39.010 --> 02:40.270
Here you go!

02:47.510 --> 02:50.270
<b>The Big Bath 
Akihabara Town Baths</b>

02:48.930 --> 02:50.270
Oh, my...

02:50.680 --> 02:53.350
Next time, we should all come together.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.900
<b>An Invitation from Eastal</b>

02:56.870 --> 02:59.160
An Invitation from Eastal.

03:02.780 --> 03:04.200
Go!

03:04.200 --> 03:06.010
<i>Head-splitter!</i>

03:06.590 --> 03:07.580
I did it!

03:08.370 --> 03:09.360
Huh?

03:09.360 --> 03:10.210
I can't move!

03:11.480 --> 03:12.710
I'm in trouble!

03:12.710 --> 03:14.170
<i>Purification Barrier!</i>

03:16.530 --> 03:17.190
<b>Death</b>

03:17.370 --> 03:18.380
<i>Assassinate!</i>

03:19.120 --> 03:20.380
<i>Aura Saber!</i>

03:24.910 --> 03:27.220
I'm sorry, I...

03:27.220 --> 03:29.660
Samurai have a long cool down.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.900
And sometimes, after casting a spell, 
they can't move afterward.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.120
Did you forget?

03:34.120 --> 03:36.860
I knew it in my head, but I just...

03:36.860 --> 03:39.790
Shiro asked us to look after you guys,

03:39.790 --> 03:41.540
so we'll be cracking down on ya!

03:41.540 --> 03:43.740
Thank you, teacher!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.740
Thank you!

03:43.740 --> 03:44.500
Good!

03:44.500 --> 03:47.620
First, Tohya, as men, we can talk about p—

03:48.780 --> 03:49.930
"P"?

03:49.930 --> 03:50.890
Nothing.

03:50.890 --> 03:51.880
Don't worry about it.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.250
Uh...

03:53.250 --> 03:55.230
I said we'd crack down on you...

03:55.230 --> 03:58.430
But we can't teach you much about 
shrine priest techniques.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.130
That's okay.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.870
He told me everything I need to know.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.570
<b>Shiroe Memo</b>

04:04.530 --> 04:05.810
Shiroe?

04:06.500 --> 04:07.510
Chief?

04:07.870 --> 04:10.520
Were you up all night again?

04:10.520 --> 04:13.650
No, I slept a little.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.210
It's a nice day.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.580
You should go out for a change of pace.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.780
Akihabara is changing so quickly.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.780
<b>Steam Engine-Equipped Vessel 
Ocypete</b>

04:18.780 --> 04:21.780
<b>Under 
Construction!?</b>

04:22.040 --> 04:26.040
I'd love to, but I have more 
things I need to look into.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.980
You mean a way to get home?

04:28.980 --> 04:30.610
That, too...

04:30.610 --> 04:33.250
But if we're to live in this world, 
even if only for a while,

04:33.250 --> 04:35.920
we'll need knowledge and information.

04:36.190 --> 04:38.040
What is this?

04:38.560 --> 04:41.350
If a cook prepares food himself,

04:41.350 --> 04:44.530
or a crafter creates something himself,

04:45.370 --> 04:48.190
they can make things that didn't 
exist in the world of <i>Elder Tale</i>.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.520
So you're trying to see if you can use 
your scribing skill for anything?

04:54.370 --> 04:57.060
I was able to draw up a simple contract.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.450
I wonder if I could use it for other things...

05:01.500 --> 05:02.530
Henrietta?

05:02.530 --> 05:04.020
Shiroe!

05:04.020 --> 05:05.660
I can't handle this anymore!

05:05.660 --> 05:07.120
Save me!

05:07.120 --> 05:07.780
Huh?

05:07.780 --> 05:09.880
I want to go! I want to go!

05:09.880 --> 05:11.660
I want to eat! I want to eat!

05:11.660 --> 05:14.130
She called all of you, too?

05:14.130 --> 05:15.190
Yup!

05:14.130 --> 05:15.190
Yeah.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.930
What's going on?

05:16.930 --> 05:18.040
Well, you see...

05:18.240 --> 05:19.290
It's summer.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.550
Summer has come to this world!

05:21.550 --> 05:23.340
And summer is all about the beach.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.680
Snow cones, watermelon, ramen, 
and curry rice at the beach, right?

05:28.970 --> 05:30.510
I want to go! I want to go!

05:30.510 --> 05:32.600
I want to eat! I want to eat!

05:31.380 --> 05:32.600
Stop this!

05:33.020 --> 05:36.640
The Crescent Moon Alliance is one of 
the Round Table's eleven guilds.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.160
And you're its guild master!

05:39.820 --> 05:42.940
Akihabara still has a lot of problems.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.860
We can't leave it right now, can we?

05:46.810 --> 05:49.560
I've worked really hard!

05:49.560 --> 05:51.640
I'm still working really hard!

05:51.640 --> 05:52.740
Can't I have

05:53.090 --> 05:55.580
some fun once in a while?

05:55.580 --> 05:57.050
Come down, Marie!

05:56.500 --> 06:00.590
It appears the lady is the one 
who needs a change of pace.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.770
That's dangerous!

06:01.850 --> 06:03.160
The beach, huh?

06:05.750 --> 06:07.310
What's this?

06:07.310 --> 06:08.790
A new quest?

06:09.340 --> 06:14.720
"Round Table-Sponsored Training 
Camp for New Players"?

06:14.720 --> 06:21.760
A summer training camp for 
new players under level 40?

06:25.480 --> 06:26.400
It's here!

06:27.030 --> 06:29.980
This is the stage that's been set for me!

06:30.610 --> 06:34.640
At last, it's time for everyone to learn

06:34.640 --> 06:37.480
the magnificent name of Rundel Haus Code!

06:39.310 --> 06:41.280
This is a great idea!

06:41.280 --> 06:44.210
It's the perfect excuse for a vacation.

06:44.210 --> 06:45.890
The beach! Training camp!

06:45.890 --> 06:46.510
Marie!

06:47.020 --> 06:51.160
The Round Table was talking 
about training new players.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.010
Two birds with one stone.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.500
For Dark Shiroe, coming up with 
a plan like this is no big deal.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.400
Dark Shiroe?

07:01.750 --> 07:03.710
He's a good Dark Shiroe!

07:03.710 --> 07:05.910
And you, as well, Naotsugu!

07:05.170 --> 07:05.910
"As well"?

07:06.780 --> 07:09.030
Will you be going, Serara?

07:09.740 --> 07:10.360
Yes.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.780
Um...

07:12.560 --> 07:14.530
What about you?

07:14.530 --> 07:17.790
I shall attend as one of the trainers.

07:20.060 --> 07:21.590
She's so obvious.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.040
Meow?

07:24.430 --> 07:26.920
Shiroe and all his friends will be there.

07:27.570 --> 07:28.700
Yeah.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.040
We'll have to do our best.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.600
<i>Part of me always blamed myself...</i>

07:37.850 --> 07:39.810
<i>For not being able to do anything for Tohya.</i>

07:40.660 --> 07:43.360
<i>I thought I couldn't do anything.</i>

07:45.120 --> 07:47.150
<i>But that's over.</i>

07:48.250 --> 07:52.160
<i>I must make Shiroe think he did the right thing</i>

07:53.140 --> 07:55.520
<i>when he saved me.</i>

08:02.330 --> 08:05.000
Nothing's biting today.

08:08.340 --> 08:09.930
What's going on?

08:10.760 --> 08:14.060
So this is where the training 
camp will be held, my lord?

08:14.330 --> 08:17.190
The town of Choushi, in the Zantleaf region.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.450
Karashin has already gone 
and looked at the area,

08:20.450 --> 08:23.350
and has spoken to the People of the Land there.

08:23.690 --> 08:25.600
That's my boy.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.990
Shouryuu, of our guild,

08:26.990 --> 08:30.570
and Rezarick, from the Black Swords, 
will be participating as trainers.

08:30.570 --> 08:31.950
That's fine, but...

08:32.650 --> 08:35.490
Now all I need is sunscreen!

08:35.490 --> 08:37.060
It's too early for that.

08:37.060 --> 08:39.080
The camp is next month, Marie...

08:39.080 --> 08:42.830
I have a summer dress for you, Akatsuki!

08:41.830 --> 08:42.830
No!

08:43.120 --> 08:44.700
Everyone's getting overexcited.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.460
Come on, try it on!

08:45.460 --> 08:46.080
No!

08:48.410 --> 08:49.970
Did you find sunscreen?

08:49.970 --> 08:53.470
No, there are weird people outside town.

08:55.690 --> 08:56.880
What's going on?

08:56.880 --> 08:58.850
Was there an event like this?

08:58.850 --> 09:00.470
Not that I remember.

09:00.890 --> 09:01.840
That's it.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.490
Hmm...

09:03.490 --> 09:06.860
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

09:08.290 --> 09:09.560
What?

09:09.560 --> 09:11.360
What's happening?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.120
They're all People of the Land.

09:13.570 --> 09:14.860
Which means...

09:15.690 --> 09:17.020
So are they.

09:19.430 --> 09:22.760
I am a messenger of Sergiatte Cowen,

09:22.760 --> 09:26.500
High Lord of Eastal's League of Freedom Cities.

09:27.040 --> 09:31.300
I request an audience with 
the Round Table's leader.

09:32.730 --> 09:35.800
<i>In </i>Elder Tale<i>, Japan is called Yamato.</i>

09:36.400 --> 09:39.060
<i>It's divided into five major territories.</i>

09:40.000 --> 09:45.020
<i>The League of Freedom Cities of Eastal is an 
alliance of lords that rule Eastern Japan.</i>

09:46.220 --> 09:49.770
<i>Eastal has now made contact with the Round Table.</i>

09:51.030 --> 09:54.280
<i>They've asked for our participation in 
a meeting of the lords next month,</i>

09:54.280 --> 09:56.560
<i>and have invited us to a dance.</i>

09:58.430 --> 10:01.410
Did you anticipate this, as well?

10:01.660 --> 10:06.050
The People of the Land should be 
well aware of the Round Table.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.990
I expected them to make a move.

10:09.700 --> 10:13.200
They said they were prepared 
to grant titles of nobility...

10:13.600 --> 10:15.260
It's a difficult question.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.510
As is whether to participate in the conference.

10:18.510 --> 10:20.300
What do you mean?

10:20.580 --> 10:23.500
If we participate, we can make connections 
among the People of the Land.

10:23.500 --> 10:28.560
We may be able to learn things we 
don't yet know about the world.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.480
And the demerits?

10:31.150 --> 10:33.970
There's a chance we may get 
caught up in their politics.

10:34.690 --> 10:38.700
If we don't participate, 
that possibility goes away, but...

10:39.230 --> 10:41.990
We lose a chance to gain valuable information.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.860
That's the trade-off.

10:44.950 --> 10:47.240
Is there a chance of war with them?

10:48.130 --> 10:48.980
Unlikely.

10:49.750 --> 10:56.230
Generally speaking, they are far 
weaker than we adventurers are.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.100
Then what do you have in mind, Shiroe?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.190
I can smell the salt air.

11:16.190 --> 11:18.900
It's so different from Akihabara.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.580
Look, Minori!

11:25.690 --> 11:28.880
It seems this area is primarily fields.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.620
Yeah!

11:32.500 --> 11:33.790
Those look good!

11:33.790 --> 11:36.760
Don't take them without asking, Tohya.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.610
How vulgar.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.260
That's the problem with commoners.

11:40.260 --> 11:41.470
What'd you say?!

11:41.470 --> 11:43.030
Tohya!

11:43.030 --> 11:45.470
You're as lively as ever.

11:45.470 --> 11:46.890
Isuzu!

11:46.890 --> 11:51.360
In the real world, you'd never think of 
holding a training camp within a game.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.900
Is she one of the People of the 
Land that live around here?

12:06.850 --> 12:08.030
Seriously?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.960
Isn't this a school?

12:11.410 --> 12:14.220
This is where we'll be staying!

12:14.220 --> 12:16.890
Tonight, we'll have a barbecue in the field!

12:17.990 --> 12:20.950
I wish Shiroe could've come.

12:20.950 --> 12:21.650
Yeah.

12:22.340 --> 12:26.300
He has an important conference 
with the People of the Land.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.780
He has to attend.

12:29.530 --> 12:32.120
I wonder if the training camp is going well.

12:32.120 --> 12:36.690
Hey, I'm leaving my steam engine to be here.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.910
Stay focused, strategist.

12:38.910 --> 12:40.280
Understood.

12:41.770 --> 12:43.200
I see...

12:43.480 --> 12:47.840
Then we should attend the meeting 
to gather information.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.270
So they're going to give us titles of nobility?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.780
As though they're better than we are.

12:52.780 --> 12:54.920
They're only non-player characters.

12:55.180 --> 12:57.900
They aren't mere NPCs.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.800
I thought we understood that.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.970
Sorry.

13:01.970 --> 13:03.320
It's just habit.

13:03.320 --> 13:08.920
Then, we're all in agreement about 
attending the conference of lords?

13:09.560 --> 13:11.630
So who's going?

13:12.130 --> 13:15.100
That day overlaps with the training camp.

13:15.100 --> 13:18.690
I'm in charge of that training camp, so...

13:18.690 --> 13:21.660
I suppose Crusty would be first.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.840
He's the Round Table's representative.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.750
Yeah.

13:25.750 --> 13:29.870
Which means someone from the 
crafting guilds should also go...

13:31.080 --> 13:34.720
We're working on the Ocypete...

13:34.720 --> 13:37.520
And I have many other projects.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.350
I'm just getting to the good part.

13:40.660 --> 13:41.940
At times like these...

13:41.940 --> 13:43.470
There's only one thing to do.

13:44.270 --> 13:45.470
Rock, paper...

13:47.470 --> 13:49.110
And so...

13:49.110 --> 13:51.490
Michitaka will be happy to go.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.720
Then it's decided!

13:52.910 --> 13:54.980
No, I'd like to have one more.

13:55.380 --> 13:59.490
Someone skilled in bureaucracy 
and information analysis.

14:00.490 --> 14:03.420
Stare...

14:01.860 --> 14:03.420
Yeah, I thought so.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.700
So that's what happened?

14:06.700 --> 14:09.450
If you'd wanted, you could have 
gone to the training camp.

14:09.450 --> 14:12.420
A ninja must follow her master.

14:12.420 --> 14:13.620
Really?

14:13.620 --> 14:16.010
And why is Henrietta here?

14:16.010 --> 14:20.250
I told you that I'm participating as an observer.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.380
And what's sticking out of your magic bag?

14:23.890 --> 14:25.570
Just some fabric...

14:25.570 --> 14:28.790
It most definitely isn't Akatsuki's summer dress!

14:28.790 --> 14:30.680
<i>She followed me to get to Akatsuki.</i>

14:31.430 --> 14:33.140
A pretty girl on each arm?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.270
I'm jealous...

14:35.520 --> 14:37.230
It isn't like that.

14:37.230 --> 14:42.140
So, what kind of information are you after?

14:42.140 --> 14:44.040
Everything we don't know.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.910
But especially information about 
the People of the Land.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.160
What do you mean?

14:50.780 --> 14:53.890
When <i>Elder Tale</i> was a game,

14:53.890 --> 14:58.850
the People of the Land were set to be 
far less powerful than adventurers.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.540
There were exceptions, such as the 
Precursors and the Royal Guard,

15:02.540 --> 15:05.540
but generally, their levels and combat abilities

15:05.540 --> 15:07.240
never rose above a certain limit.

15:07.920 --> 15:12.320
If adventurers die, we revive at the Cathedral,

15:12.320 --> 15:15.110
but the People of the Land die for good.

15:15.110 --> 15:20.800
But since the Apocalypse, the People 
of the Land have changed.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.910
Sorry to drag you along with me.

15:24.910 --> 15:25.910
Not at all...

15:26.450 --> 15:31.820
For one thing, they aren't simple 
non-player characters anymore.

15:32.420 --> 15:36.130
But for another, you used to 
receive requests from them,

15:36.130 --> 15:40.210
known as quests, and then 
items for completing them.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.960
The magic bag is one of them.

15:43.420 --> 15:47.460
It's supposed to be the reward for one 
of the basic quests everyone does.

15:48.890 --> 15:54.850
If the People of the Land's change means 
no one can do that quest anymore...

15:54.850 --> 16:00.980
New players who don't have 
a magic bag yet never will.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.850
The effect will be bigger than we imagined.

16:04.850 --> 16:07.130
Did you tell Marie about this?

16:07.130 --> 16:08.110
I did.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.860
Information?

16:11.150 --> 16:13.980
Yeah, Shiro asked me.

16:14.540 --> 16:19.440
He said to "talk to the People of the Land 
and learn as much as you can."

16:19.440 --> 16:21.710
That's why you spoke to the village elder?

16:21.710 --> 16:23.250
That wasn't the only reason.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.380
It's simple courtesy.

16:26.380 --> 16:28.500
Oh...

16:28.500 --> 16:30.330
Shiroe asked you to...

16:31.660 --> 16:33.510
Then we have to do our best!

16:34.350 --> 16:35.600
You're such a good girl.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.620
Wh-Why?

16:37.620 --> 16:39.480
I feel like patting you on the head.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.700
I-It hurts!

16:41.700 --> 16:44.510
We've finished our greetings, so let's go!

16:44.510 --> 16:45.390
Huh?

16:50.030 --> 16:51.820
Ah, it's cold!

16:53.980 --> 16:55.700
Nothing beats the beach!

16:59.630 --> 17:00.460
Tohya!

17:00.460 --> 17:02.060
That's something only a warrior could do...

17:02.060 --> 17:02.910
Huh?

17:02.910 --> 17:05.340
You come, too!

17:05.340 --> 17:09.000
Everyone, have you stretched enough?

17:09.590 --> 17:13.260
If you underestimate the sea, 
bad things can happen.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.050
I bet you just can't swim, can you?

17:16.050 --> 17:17.220
What?

17:19.710 --> 17:21.140
Very well.

17:21.340 --> 17:25.400
My beautiful swimming has been 
compared to a leaping dolphin!

17:26.230 --> 17:27.360
Beho—

17:28.790 --> 17:30.400
What?!

17:30.400 --> 17:32.030
Here you go.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.350
Thanks.

17:32.890 --> 17:34.480
That's cold!

17:34.900 --> 17:37.070
By the way, um, the information...

17:37.070 --> 17:38.030
Later, later.

17:38.030 --> 17:40.590
It's summer! Swimsuits!

17:41.090 --> 17:42.760
I'm so happy!

17:47.160 --> 17:48.390
Look at that.

17:48.390 --> 17:52.300
S-Sir... It's so fantastic.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.670
<i>About two hours from the city of Akihabara,</i>

17:55.670 --> 17:58.270
<i>where southern Tokyo would 
be in the real world,</i>

17:58.270 --> 18:02.930
<i>where Hamarikyuu Park would sit, 
is the Palace of Eternal Ice.</i>

18:03.390 --> 18:12.430
<b>The Palace of Eternal Ice

18:03.900 --> 18:11.380
<i>A palace with foundations of magical ice, 
created by a dead race of ancient Alvs.</i>

18:43.820 --> 18:45.050
This is pretty...

18:45.050 --> 18:46.750
...nerve-wracking.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.950
Just think of everyone around as 
monsters, and you can relax.

18:50.610 --> 18:53.420
I think that's only you, my lord.

18:54.020 --> 18:55.440
My lord...

18:56.020 --> 18:59.420
Do I look... w-weird?

19:00.460 --> 19:01.950
You don't look weird!

19:02.240 --> 19:04.860
You look cute! Beautiful!

19:04.860 --> 19:07.540
Like some kind of fluffy strawberry something!

19:07.540 --> 19:09.330
I want to order you for takeout!

19:10.440 --> 19:11.960
No, I <i>will</i> order you.

19:12.220 --> 19:13.850
<i>She stated that like a fact...</i>

19:14.430 --> 19:16.820
<i>She definitely followed Akatsuki here.</i>

19:16.820 --> 19:19.260
D-Do I really?

19:19.260 --> 19:20.480
I feel so weird.

19:20.890 --> 19:23.400
It's hard to conceal my weapons.

19:24.470 --> 19:27.700
Where were you keeping that thing?

19:28.350 --> 19:29.570
My lord...

19:29.570 --> 19:30.600
Hey...

19:30.600 --> 19:34.110
You look pretty calm yourself, Shiroe.

19:34.110 --> 19:36.240
A hero of his caliber

19:36.240 --> 19:40.610
has no problem escorting two 
ladies to a big ball like this.

19:40.610 --> 19:41.830
How rude.

19:41.830 --> 19:46.240
A fancy ball like this is nothing for Dark Kuroe.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.660
Dark Kuroe?

19:49.810 --> 19:52.330
Thank you for coming.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.670
I am Sergiatte Cowen.

19:56.090 --> 20:01.800
I am the coordinator for the 
League of Freedom Cities.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.270
<i>Wow...</i>

20:03.270 --> 20:04.990
<i>It's a real nobleman.</i>

20:04.990 --> 20:06.190
Hello.

20:06.980 --> 20:08.830
Thank you for your invitation.

20:09.460 --> 20:14.350
I am Crusty, the representative for 
Akihabara's Round Table Conference.

20:14.850 --> 20:16.300
<i>He has guts...</i>

20:16.840 --> 20:19.230
<i>Crusty looks like a nobleman himself.</i>

20:20.860 --> 20:22.880
I am Shiroe.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.950
It's nice to meet you.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.440
<i>Sergiatte Cowen,</i>

20:27.960 --> 20:31.670
<i>lord of the largest eastern city, 
the capital city of Maihama.</i>

20:32.370 --> 20:36.370
<i>The most powerful person in Eastal, 
League of Freedom Cities.</i>

20:39.230 --> 20:40.360
I see.

20:40.960 --> 20:46.430
So these guilds are like nobility 
without lands of their own,

20:46.430 --> 20:49.990
and the powerful guilds rule the city 
through discussion and debate?

20:50.490 --> 20:55.470
So it resembles the way we run 
Eastal, but on a smaller scale.

20:55.870 --> 20:57.010
That's correct.

20:57.440 --> 21:03.820
But that means bestowing a noble 
title upon only one of you

21:03.820 --> 21:06.630
would cause needless friction.

21:07.210 --> 21:12.320
As expected, we're attracting a lot of attention.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.710
But no one's talking to us.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.510
Out of respect for Sergiatte?

21:17.510 --> 21:18.210
No...

21:18.820 --> 21:23.740
<i>My guess would be that, just as we lack 
information about People of the Land,</i>

21:24.230 --> 21:27.300
<i>they also lack information regarding us.</i>

21:28.340 --> 21:30.070
<i>So they're wary.</i>

21:30.750 --> 21:32.740
<i>They want information about us,</i>

21:32.740 --> 21:37.050
<i>but they must be very careful 
that the conversation</i>

21:37.050 --> 21:39.110
<i>doesn't reveal too much about them.</i>

21:40.540 --> 21:42.360
<i>This'll be tough.</i>

21:49.030 --> 21:51.240
So that's a princess?

21:51.520 --> 21:55.250
That's my granddaughter in the center.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.090
She is quite beautiful.

21:57.540 --> 21:58.710
What is her name?

22:00.640 --> 22:02.210
Lenessia.

22:06.100 --> 22:11.610
And tomorrow, for party training, 
we'll be going to a dungeon.

22:13.030 --> 22:14.160
A dungeon!

22:14.940 --> 22:17.720
It's called the Forest of Lagranda.

22:18.340 --> 22:19.240
All right!

22:19.240 --> 22:21.070
I can't wait.

22:21.070 --> 22:24.490
However, it will only be you guys.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.480
Only us?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.640
Shiroe...

22:30.990 --> 22:35.000
<b>Shiroe Memo 

The basics of combat!!</b>

24:05.930 --> 24:08.210
A bountiful banquet is also

24:08.210 --> 24:11.220
a place of politics, where opposing groups collide.

24:11.220 --> 24:13.800
The nobles try to gain control 
of the adventurers.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.240
And Shiroe and the Round Table 
are forced to negotiate.

24:17.240 --> 24:21.900
Meanwhile, Minori, Tohya, and their 
companions face a harsh reality.

24:21.900 --> 24:29.990
<b>The Forest of Lagranda</b>

24:22.290 --> 24:24.020
Next time: The Forest of Lagranda.

24:24.450 --> 24:26.970
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
