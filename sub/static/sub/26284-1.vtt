00:03.170 --> 00:05.423
<i>Some people
have said I'm overly sensitive.</i>

00:10.594 --> 00:11.762
What now?

00:11.846 --> 00:14.223
Missy gave me cinnamon gum!

00:15.599 --> 00:18.394
Sure, sure.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.604
<i>And by some people,
I mean everyone.</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:25.007
<i>While I may not be</i>
X-Men <i>material...</i>

00:26.110 --> 00:29.405
<i>...I have always possessed
unusually heightened senses.</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:30.489
Ew.

00:31.157 --> 00:34.160
<i>Georgie,
put your shoes back on!</i>

00:34.243 --> 00:35.786
He can't smell this.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.329
<i>Yes, I can!</i>

00:37.413 --> 00:40.458
<i>I also had
extraordinary hearing.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:45.546
<i>During dinner, I could tune out
the cacophony of chewing,</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:47.298
<i>slurping,</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:51.927
<i>chewing, cutlery scraping
against plates,</i>

00:52.011 --> 00:53.679
<i>chewing,</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:55.014
<i>and my father's heavy breathing</i>

00:55.097 --> 00:56.537
<i>as he wrestled
with a ketchup bottle.</i>

00:59.477 --> 01:02.438
<i>But tonight, there was
one sound I couldn't tune out.</i>

01:07.026 --> 01:08.486
Why aren't you
eating, Sheldon?

01:08.569 --> 01:11.864
How can I with that
horrible noise?

01:11.947 --> 01:13.199
What noise?

01:13.282 --> 01:15.868
That irritating,
high-pitched buzz.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.495
I don't hear nothin'.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.662
Me, neither.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.414
How can you not?

01:20.498 --> 01:21.499
Wait.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.582
I think I hear it.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.335
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.253
It's coming out of your face.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.843
I guess I hear a little hum.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.720
Refrigerators make
noise, Sheldon.

01:34.804 --> 01:37.306
This is new. It's never
made this sound before.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.849
We should call a repairman.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.143
I'm not spending money
on a fridge that's workin'.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.938
Then think of it as spending
money on my mental stability.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.440
Ignore it, Sheldon.

01:47.191 --> 01:50.027
<i>Ignoring things that irritate
me isn't my strong suit.</i>

01:51.654 --> 01:53.280
<i>Obsessively fixating on them...</i>

01:53.364 --> 01:56.283
<i>now that's what gets me
out of bed in the morning.</i>

01:56.367 --> 01:59.203
<i>♪♪ Nobody else

01:59.286 --> 02:02.039
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

02:04.750 --> 02:07.002

02:07.086 --> 02:11.215
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪♪</i>

02:19.974 --> 02:21.600
What are you doing?

02:21.684 --> 02:23.519
The sound from the refrigerator.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.896
It's right between D
and D-sharp.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.232
Ugh! It's making my skin crawl.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.734
What if I hold a pillow
over your face

02:30.818 --> 02:32.403
for, like, a really long time?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.029
No, that's dangerous.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.574
Do you know if we have earplugs?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.617
If we did,
I'd be wearing them.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.077
Go to sleep.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.705
I can't.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.957
Put your fingers in your ears.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.751
And risk driving wax back
into my inner ear canal?

02:47.835 --> 02:48.836
No, thank you.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.091
Oh.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.062
Good morning.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.815
Are you trying to kill me?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.359
No, I think
you're great.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.445
Then why are you
in my bed?

03:14.528 --> 03:15.654
I couldn't sleep.

03:15.738 --> 03:18.490
Our refrigerator is
making a weird noise.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.117
But so was one
of your nostrils,

03:20.201 --> 03:21.785
so don't expect
me back tonight.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.621
Go home before
I call the police.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.664
You wouldn't call the
police on your Moonpie.

03:25.748 --> 03:27.124
Then I'll call your mother.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.960
That you would do.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.713
And leave my extra key behind.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.924
Aw.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.967
Aw.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.268
Do you know anything about
surviving psychological torture?

03:46.352 --> 03:48.646
Because my family
escaped communist Vietnam,

03:48.729 --> 03:49.915
we have to know about torture?

03:49.939 --> 03:51.565
That was my thought.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.525
Well, you're in luck.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.902
What do you want to know?

03:54.985 --> 03:57.738
I'm being tormented by a sound
coming from our refrigerator,

03:57.821 --> 03:59.657
and I don't know how
to deal with it.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.326
When my uncle was
in a reeducation camp,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.870
he would imagine
disemboweling his torturers

04:04.954 --> 04:06.789
with a bamboo spike.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.834
Maybe I'll just get a book
on refrigerator repair instead.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.919
Okay.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.587
New subject.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.130
Jessica Gieger
wears a black bra.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.509
I saw it through the
sleeve of her shirt.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.012
Not beige, not pink.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.889
Black.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.724
So mysterious.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.274
What are you doing?

04:33.357 --> 04:35.276
I'm going to take apart
the refrigerator

04:35.359 --> 04:37.319
and figure out what's
making that noise.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.406
That is a really good idea.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.242
Usually you're not
supportive of my efforts.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.743
I'm more mature now.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.423
- Hi, Mom.
- What did you do?

04:57.506 --> 05:00.634
Good news. I found out
what part was making that noise.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.261
You have to put
this back together!

05:02.344 --> 05:04.179
Now we're getting
to the bad news.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.390
What made you think
you could fix this?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.642
I'm smart...
and I had a book.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.228
Do you <i>still</i> think
you're smart?

05:12.313 --> 05:13.897
Yes.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.443
I told him not to do it.
He wouldn't listen.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.200
$200?!

05:25.284 --> 05:27.453
It'll be okay.
We'll find the money.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.996
Wait.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.623
The old fridge in the garage.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.335
- What's it...? What was...?
- What's that?

05:34.418 --> 05:37.129
Well, I kind of donated
that fridge to the church.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.841
You know, for the needy.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.509
Are you kidding me?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.681
I see tense moments like this
more than you think.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.310
I'll just give you guys
some space.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.775
You know how much it's gonna
cost to fix that fridge?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.235
$200. I have
really good hearing.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.907
Do you have any idea how hard
I work for the money we get?

06:05.824 --> 06:06.867
I'm sorry.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.579
I don't care how long it takes.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.540
You're gonna pay me back
every cent of this.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.042
Yes, sir.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.379
I am very disappointed in you.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.390
You know if you cry,
I can't enjoy your pain.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.874
Mom,

06:55.958 --> 06:58.168
since Sheldon cost you
all that money,

06:58.252 --> 07:00.129
who's your new favorite...
me or Georgie?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.964
You know I don't
have favorites.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.424
Yeah, right.

07:03.507 --> 07:07.261
Okay, whoever takes the trash
out first is my favorite.

07:07.803 --> 07:08.971
She thinks we're stupid.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.224
Dad, I'm pleased
to tell you

07:12.307 --> 07:14.309
I've got a job to
pay back my debt.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.811
Is that so?

07:15.894 --> 07:17.521
I'm going to be a paperboy.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.066
Well, that's great.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.401
I'm proud of you.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.278
How do you plan
on delivering these papers?

07:24.361 --> 07:27.156
- Bicycle.
- You don't know how to ride a bicycle.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.991
There's nothing I can't learn.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.369
A week ago, I didn't know how
to take apart a refrigerator.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.914
He can't deliver newspapers.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.000
- Why not?
- It's too dangerous.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.877
I think you're being
a little overprotective.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.255
You expect him
to go riding around at 5:00 a.m.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.091
with cars and dogs
and who knows what else?

07:46.175 --> 07:48.218
I did it when I was his age.
So did Georgie.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.891
You're gonna teach your brother
how to do this.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.309
What if I don't want to?

07:55.392 --> 07:56.560
You're doing it anyway.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.896
Hey, nobody asked
your opinion.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.482
I knew the answer.
I got excited.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.284
Georgie?

08:12.367 --> 08:13.994
Georgie?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.245
What?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.332
I'm ready to scrub the moral
stain off my character.

08:20.459 --> 08:23.045
I hate everything about you.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.471
When does the truck
bring the papers?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.056
When it does.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.015
That's a tautology.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.018
- What?
- A tautology.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.895
A statement that's true,
but uninformative.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.232
Hey, you're supposed
to be the one teaching me.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.608
That's funny.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.278
Oh, there it is.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.572
Over here! Over here!

08:50.656 --> 08:52.074
This is exciting.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.825
It's somethin'.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.207
Thank you!
Have a great day!

09:00.290 --> 09:01.583
Now what?

09:01.667 --> 09:04.002
Take 'em into the
garage and fold 'em.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.255
Oh, boy.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.886
Fold 'em like this,
then rubber band.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.723
But you didn't fold it
into even thirds.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.142
- Nobody cares.
- I care.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.144
Then do whatever you want.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.316
Wake me up when you're done.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.527
<i>Over the next 17 minutes,</i>

09:28.610 --> 09:32.406
<i>I used physics, geometry
and old-fashioned hard work</i>

09:32.489 --> 09:34.908
<i>to create the perfect
newspaper-folding system.</i>

09:36.451 --> 09:38.078
I'm done.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.373
Great. Let's
load up the wagon.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.209
No, I'm done with this one;
I still have 39 more to go.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.802
He's gonna be fine.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.029
You don't have to tell me that.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.263
I know he's gonna be fine.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.973
If you believe that,

09:58.056 --> 09:59.766
why aren't you in bed right now?

09:59.850 --> 10:02.131
Because this is the same boy
who couldn't find his way out

10:02.185 --> 10:03.812
of that sleeping bag.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.148
He made his way out.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.109
Just took him five
or ten minutes.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.028
I know you're
worried, but...

10:11.111 --> 10:14.698
he needs to experience
the world a little bit.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.076
Why not let him do it
when most of it's asleep?

10:18.160 --> 10:19.870
I suppose you're right.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.084
You coming back to bed?

10:26.168 --> 10:27.544
Are you crazy?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.463
That's my little boy
out there in the dark.

10:29.546 --> 10:33.133
Mm, but your big boy's
right here under the covers.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.177
Ugh.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.597
There is a nicer way
to say that.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.934
All right, you got
your list of addresses?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.895
- Right here.
- 'Kay. All you got to do

10:44.978 --> 10:46.581
is go up to each house
and throw the newspaper

10:46.605 --> 10:47.814
at their front door.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.149
Got it.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.609
All right,
I'm going back to bed.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.693
Thank you, Georgie.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.236
You've been a wonderful teacher,

10:53.320 --> 10:55.447
and I'm very appreciative
that you took the ti...

10:55.530 --> 10:57.741
Ah! My hands are black!

10:57.824 --> 11:00.118
- Why are my hands black?
- Relax.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.120
It's just the ink
from the papers.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.830
Why wasn't I warned of this?!

11:05.624 --> 11:07.668
Out, damned spot.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.836
That's from Shakespeare!

Hey, Sheldon.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.706
Hello, Billy.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.041
Are you our new paperboy?

11:48.125 --> 11:50.127
Yes, I'm joining
the work-a-day world.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.754
I work, too!
I take care of our chickens.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.047
Don't get the wrong idea.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.842
When I grow up, I plan on being
a theoretical physicist.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.301
Cool.

Collecting!

Collecting!

13:51.373 --> 13:53.708
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hello, Mrs. Sparks.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.336
I'm here to collect
for this week's paper delivery.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.505
Right. Hang on.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.758
Also, I'm given to understand
that tipping is customary,

14:01.842 --> 14:04.511
so feel free
to express your appreciation.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.721
Here you go.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.684
You tipped me a dime?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.143
Is there a problem?

14:12.686 --> 14:15.564
No, it just doesn't seem
like very much.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.566
You were late every day.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.150
Well, I had to brave
the elements.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.360
I saw you.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.821
"Brave" isn't the word
that I would use.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.453
Hey, Sheldon.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.830
You look sad.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.082
I am.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.376
Want an egg?

14:45.010 --> 14:46.428
Sheldon?

14:46.511 --> 14:47.846
What?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.431
You suck.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.516
I'm sorry,
but I have a job to do.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.060
How much longer
till you pay Dad back?

14:54.853 --> 14:56.813
At this rate, six months.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.941
You suck.

15:00.942 --> 15:01.943
<i>Make sure your parents</i>

15:02.027 --> 15:05.280
sign these.
I'll need 'em back by Friday.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.615
Mr. Cooper,
you're late.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.782
I know I'm late.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.618
My training wheels broke.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.744
Training wheels?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.078
Yes, Derek!

15:12.162 --> 15:13.514
I have training wheels
like a child!

15:13.538 --> 15:15.123
I also have a job
like an adult.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.125
I'm a very complicated person!

15:17.208 --> 15:19.085
Sure. Let's go with complicated.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.296
Okay. Permission slips.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.258
What's in the mug?

15:25.342 --> 15:26.760
It's a coffee mug, Tam.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.219
What do you think is in it?

15:28.303 --> 15:29.429
Could be soup.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.805
It's coffee.

15:30.889 --> 15:31.890
Where'd you get it?

15:31.973 --> 15:34.017
The teachers' lounge.
And before you ask,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.603
no, I'm not the world's
greatest grandpa.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.146
Since when do you drink coffee?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.398
I don't,
but this job is killing me.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.942
You wouldn't understand.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.820
You realize I have a job.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.739
At your parents'
convenience store?

15:47.822 --> 15:49.115
That doesn't count.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.575
Why not?

15:50.659 --> 15:51.886
You get to sit
at a cash register

15:51.910 --> 15:53.495
and have the fun of doing math.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.747
Actually,
the cash register tells you

15:55.830 --> 15:57.040
how much change to give.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.293
Oh. That's too bad.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.008
Oh, I hear they're opening
an Olive Garden

16:07.092 --> 16:09.844
- where the old Sizzler used to be.
- On Hampton Road?

16:09.928 --> 16:11.447
- Yeah.
- I don't think that was a Sizzler.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.889
That was a Chi-Chi's.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.557
No, the Chi-Chi's is on Bedford,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.267
across from
the Payless Shoes.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.645
She's right. Because,
one time, we got shoes

16:18.728 --> 16:20.522
and then we got Chi-Chi's.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.731
That was a good day.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.733
Huh. I guess
that was a Sizzler.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.610
I'm sorry they closed that.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.487
Oh, there's still the
other one on Route 40.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.822
Who cares?!

16:32.450 --> 16:33.743
You have a problem?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.027
Yes, I do.
I've had a long day.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.538
Is it too much to ask
for a dinner

16:36.621 --> 16:38.123
with a little peace and quiet?

16:38.206 --> 16:39.791
Sheldon, you
do not talk

16:39.874 --> 16:41.292
to your father like that.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.629
Fine. I'd rather not speak
to any of you.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.216
Maybe I better go talk to him.

16:48.299 --> 16:49.592
- No, I got this.
- George,

16:49.676 --> 16:50.969
maybe you should
calm down first.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.679
I got this.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.146
You want to
explain yourself?

17:01.229 --> 17:02.605
I'd rather just go to bed,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.941
since I have to be up
in a few hours anyway.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.861
Look, I understand you're tired,
but that is no reason for you...

17:07.944 --> 17:10.030
I'm not just tired.
I'm exhausted.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.823
Everything hurts.

17:11.906 --> 17:12.991
I get up in the morning

17:13.074 --> 17:14.867
to do this job
I don't even like.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.368
And I'm doing it
just for the money,

17:16.453 --> 17:18.204
and it's not even
a lot of money.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.874
I keep trying harder
and harder,

17:20.957 --> 17:22.791
and it doesn't
even make a difference.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.478
So if you're going
to yell at me or punish me,

17:24.502 --> 17:26.713
let's just get it over with.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.763
I'm not gonna punish you.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.848
Why not? I deserve it.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.603
Let me tell you about my day.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.563
I got yelled at
by the principal

17:43.646 --> 17:45.857
for benching a linebacker
who's flunking English.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.610
Then I got yelled at even more
by the kid's parents.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.488
Then I had to break up
a fight in the locker room.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.323
Got elbowed in the neck.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.657
That's a rough day.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.493
That was all
before 10:00 a.m.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.538
So I get what you're
going through.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.833
But you'll notice, I didn't come
home and take it out on you.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.629
No, you didn't.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.506
I want you to get
back in there,

18:09.589 --> 18:12.217
apologize to everyone,
and finish your dinner.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.094
Yes, sir.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.974
<i>My father's
wisdom touched me deeply.</i>

18:20.058 --> 18:21.476
<i>Which is why, to this day,</i>

18:21.559 --> 18:23.061
<i>no matter
what I'm going through,</i>

18:23.144 --> 18:25.271
<i>I am never irritating
or abusive</i>

18:25.355 --> 18:28.316
<i>to any of my friends
or loved ones.</i>

18:29.067 --> 18:30.568
<i>Ask them. They'll tell you.</i>

18:37.325 --> 18:38.701
<i>For the next several months,</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
<i>I continued working
my paper route</i>

18:40.870 --> 18:43.790
<i>until I paid my father back.</i>

18:46.543 --> 18:49.337
<i>And by "working,"
I mean "delegating."</i>

18:53.716 --> 18:56.177
I have no idea where I am.
