The Feds have a case on you?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.567
No.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.442
I'm just being paranoid.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.986
Don't lie to me.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.491
I got some heat.

09:36.577 --> 09:37.993
But I got it handled.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.662
Steve, listen to me. If there'sn

10:27.961 --> 10:28.980

Listen, Hamm.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.846
I've been thinking about this.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.640
All we have to do is stall Pre

11:23.684 --> 11:24.641
until we seean opportunity

11:24.685 --> 11:25.975
to get outfrom under this. How?

11:32.651 --> 11:34.526
How's that gonna help us?

11:34.569 --> 11:36.695
Kilvinsky told the uniforms to.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.320
The Berserkers are involved?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.988

14:16.398 --> 14:17.939
No promises.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.303
Then why the hellwould I do th?

14:20.402 --> 14:22.068
Let me guess.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.821
It's because we all gotta stic.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.175
All this "Black Lives Matter" noe

14:26.199 --> 14:28.283
running throughyour head, broth?

14:30.287 --> 14:31.995
No, I wouldn't comeat you like.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.032
You weren't even raised black.

Even after all that,

14:49.764 --> 14:51.014
I don't let my skin define me.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.979
You should try it sometime.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.885
Change your mindabout the drin?

15:28.929 --> 15:29.510
I know it's a little hard on,

15:29.554 --> 15:30.511
but, no, I haven't.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.555
It's just a drink.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.641
And what wouldwe talk about ex?

15:34.684 --> 15:35.767
The fact that you're a cop

15:35.810 --> 15:37.090

15:38.813 --> 15:39.916
That is what you do here, right?

15:39.940 --> 15:43.775
Yes, and no.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.652
See, if you had just said yes,

15:45.695 --> 15:46.815

- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.838
They told securityit was about s

16:05.882 --> 16:07.162
that were stolenearlier this we.

16:07.759 --> 16:08.959
There's no reason for the Feds

16:09.928 --> 16:11.072
to get involvedwith something l.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.888
Maybe it's anacrossstateline.

16:13.932 --> 16:14.597
Nah, they tookthe security fooe

16:14.641 --> 16:15.641
from the cashier window.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.018
- And I was on it?
- No...

16:20.522 --> 16:21.980
but your mother was.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.026
There's only one reasonwhy they.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.446
To leverage me.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.375
Hey.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.171
Everything okay?

16:47.215 --> 16:48.215
No.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.791
There's something we need to...

16:51.386 --> 16:52.386
Talk about.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.335
It was just a hardchemo day. I.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.350
What is it?

16:59.394 --> 17:01.019
It's...

17:02.647 --> 17:03.687
Even with this new lawyer,

17:04.816 --> 17:06.056
I don't thinkDad's getting out.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.989
Have you been to visit him?

17:17.412 --> 17:20.038
He needs you!

17:20.080 --> 17:22.290
Is it so hard to just... just t?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.834
He doesn't need anybody.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.336
And to him, people are disposabl.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.922
Honey.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.300
I know it was hardon you when h,

17:32.343 --> 17:37.013
but... ha.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.337
If anybody deservesto hate him,.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.393
And I don't.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.231
Why?

17:52.655 --> 17:53.988
Because I'm dying, Steve.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.992
I don't have time for anger.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.699
Officer Beach.-How lon?

18:38.743 --> 18:40.618
You can leave at any time,

18:40.662 --> 18:41.994
but I'd advise against it.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.264
You know why you're here.

19:01.307 --> 19:05.226
All of them have been ruledas.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.937
One's still currently open and.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.605
Maybe.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.982
Doesn't mean I need a shrink.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.025
The department needs to know.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.156
Tell me about this one.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.911
Sir, I'm gonnaneed you to back!

19:23.955 --> 19:25.413
Let go! Back it up!

19:28.418 --> 19:30.251
Shit!

19:30.295 --> 19:32.420
Get up!

19:34.757 --> 19:35.757
Back up!

19:40.054 --> 19:41.554
You have a great record.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.014
Except for this stuff.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.517
Nobody's perfect.

19:47.979 --> 19:51.480
My goal is to help youkeep you.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.982
I can't do it alone.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.822
A lot of cops sat in your chair.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.157
Not one of themwanted to be her.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.700
Why would they?

20:02.744 --> 20:05.286
The ones that kept their jobs.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.998
And they eventually identified.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.461
I know how hardit is for a woman

20:13.504 --> 20:15.630
to be accepted ina largely male.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.048
How would you know that?

20:17.091 --> 20:19.926
But proving you're willingto gn

20:19.969 --> 20:22.011
than they areisn't solving anyt.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.723
The truth iswomen only have

20:25.767 --> 20:27.975
two options in this type of wo.

20:28.019 --> 20:31.646
You can try to get the mento se,

20:31.689 --> 20:32.980
or you can manipulate them.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.525
But either way...

20:36.569 --> 20:37.985
you never really win.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.325
That's how it feels...

20:44.369 --> 20:45.369
doesn't it?

20:53.544 --> 20:54.418
It's a tight neighborhood,

20:54.462 --> 20:56.003
so make sureyou keep a long eye.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.797
Anybody sitting too closewill g.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.120
- You're sure about this?
- Yeah.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.238
We'll set up a pole cam and w.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.011
Hey.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.504
Don't make any plans tonight.Yo.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.768
That ain't happening.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.687
If you had the tattoo the ot,

21:12.730 --> 21:13.980
Sleep would still be alive.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.158
What's up?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.522
Winters arranged for Dad to hi.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.247
Why would she do that?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.833
A relationship builder.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.376
Yeah, when heswapped out lawyer,

21:35.420 --> 21:36.877
Neckbone took it as a sign

21:36.921 --> 21:39.463
that Dad was getting ready to.

21:39.507 --> 21:40.787
And maybe you meantfor that to.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.511
You believe that?

21:47.098 --> 21:48.514
Or is that him justgetting insid

21:48.558 --> 21:49.558
like he always does?

21:51.769 --> 21:53.644
This is about Neckbonenot think,

21:53.688 --> 21:55.354
because Sleep is missing.

21:55.398 --> 21:59.025
Nothing more.-Yeah, well, his p.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.489
Okay.

22:07.201 --> 22:08.117
Here's what I think.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.786
This should be good.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.040
Your definingemotion is anger.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.043
So to fix that, we're gonnaneed.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.047
So you want me to tell youabou?

22:23.259 --> 22:24.259
Yes.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.011
I don't have an uncle.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.891
And your primary copingmechani.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.214
Maybe we'll havea look at that,.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.812
At our next app.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.136
I'm gonna give yousome breathin.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.360
Don't give me that look.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.986
It's a start.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.118
Fine.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.221
Who are the Berserkers, Pete?

23:10.264 --> 23:11.597
What?

23:11.641 --> 23:13.682
Who are the Berserkers,

23:13.726 --> 23:16.644
and why is someone texting you?

23:16.687 --> 23:17.228
You're reading my texts?

23:17.271 --> 23:20.815
Yeah.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.441
It's just a casel'm working on.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.068
I went online.

23:24.112 --> 23:27.363
It says the Berserkers havebeen.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.906
As a cop gang.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.052
Articles like that are just cli.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.493
You said your tattoohad sometho

23:32.537 --> 23:33.702
with station pride.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.663
It's a gang symbol, isn't it?

23:35.706 --> 23:38.249
Don't.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.000
Don't lie to me, Pete.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.212
No! I mean, not exactly.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.213
It's not how you think it is.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.840
I grew up withmy father telline

23:45.883 --> 23:48.217
that the peoplehe defended were.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.052
I'm nothing like your father or?

23:54.684 --> 23:56.934
Listen, I gotta goto work, alr?

23:56.978 --> 23:58.205

Go.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.980

24:15.037 --> 24:16.357
It's a classification issue, g.

24:16.664 --> 24:17.997
Gotta get your lawyer involved.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.291
Well, Winters paid youto make?

24:22.837 --> 24:24.670
Imagination'sa hell of a thing.

24:24.714 --> 24:26.881
And yours is off the rails.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.841

24:28.885 --> 24:29.945
That doesn't meananything to yo?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.482
We'll double it.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.525
I'm not interested.

24:46.777 --> 24:47.880
Look, we'reasking you nicely

24:47.904 --> 24:49.184

But out there...

25:00.041 --> 25:03.042

25:15.598 --> 25:17.515
So what do we do now?

25:17.558 --> 25:19.391
We talk to Winters.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.476
When?

25:20.520 --> 25:22.019
Hour. Neckbone's.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.750
We should take Byrd with us.

25:26.651 --> 25:27.961

If Price hears we're taking me,

25:30.655 --> 25:31.445
she'll snatch us up again.

25:31.489 --> 25:32.947
We'll handle it.

We'll see.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.605
Look who's here.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.982
Now it feels like a party.

26:12.029 --> 26:15.322
He's been hitting that pinata.

26:15.366 --> 26:17.575
Can I get you guys something t?

26:19.287 --> 26:20.995

It's cool.

26:54.530 --> 26:55.530
I'll make it quick.

26:57.158 --> 26:58.574
That's that blastmy brother waso

26:58.618 --> 26:59.618
before he disappeared.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.164
You ain't never seen?

27:05.207 --> 27:06.207
No.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.838
It's synthetic.

27:12.882 --> 27:14.082
It's like oxycontin on steroi.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.927
And crumb snatcherslike this foe

27:18.971 --> 27:20.888
are selling this shit on my c.

27:31.275 --> 27:33.484
Let's.

27:33.527 --> 27:34.527
I need it squashed.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.907
Man, unfortunately, your pops ie

27:39.950 --> 27:41.617

27:41.661 --> 27:43.077
And you can imaginehis concern

27:43.120 --> 27:46.622
when Tom fired the lawyerwho wa.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.082
Tom's not taking a deal.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.000
We're the ones who paid for the.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.211
Man, that's something that nes

28:05.643 --> 28:07.810
You find my brother...

or at least whathappened to him,

28:10.481 --> 28:12.356

28:12.400 --> 28:15.025
Until then...

28:15.069 --> 28:16.777
Tom's gonna have to see what ie

28:16.821 --> 28:17.444
to live in a world without frie.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.697
Tom's one of us.

28:19.740 --> 28:20.239
If something happens to him...

28:20.282 --> 28:21.282

29:12.668 --> 29:13.668

29:14.170 --> 29:15.439
What are we gonna do about To?

29:20.676 --> 29:21.676
as much as Neckbone does.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.396
This is so stupid.
