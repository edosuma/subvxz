00:01.069 --> 00:03.304
(maniacal laughter)

00:03.337 --> 00:04.738
Yo!

00:06.407 --> 00:07.441
(screams)

00:12.012 --> 00:15.049
FX presents Snowfall.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.421
TEDDY: Going secure.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.989
JAMES: Congress isn't going
to approve any of the funds.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.891
No access to
anything official.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.826
MATT: You're not going to
see Dad when you're here?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.328
TEDDY: I already saw him.
MATT: Through the window.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.729
TEDDY: This should buy
whatever help he needs

00:28.762 --> 00:30.564
until you get back.
I have a Cessna Caravan

00:30.598 --> 00:32.866
waiting in a hangar; all
I need is someone to fly her.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.735
Look, he getting it
for much less than 12 a key.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.004
You have somebody
stake out his little crib,

00:37.037 --> 00:39.207
-get right to the source.
MEL: Happy birthday, Franklin.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.741
You talk to my moms at all?
How she doing?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.543
Her heart's broken.
How you think she doing?

00:42.576 --> 00:44.445
Cocaina, smokable.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.514
Right now, it's being sold by
mayates in Pico-Union.

00:46.547 --> 00:50.884
Pedro ran for a reason, hmm?
He might never come back.

00:50.918 --> 00:54.088
We killed his father.
He's not going to let that go.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
-Avi!
-LAPD! Don't move!

00:55.589 --> 00:57.425
-Everybody down!
-Oh, shit, come on, get!

00:57.458 --> 00:59.427
-Hands behind your head.
-Your boy's got priors.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.095
And because it's a felony,
the bail's 50.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.197
-I want him out.
-Coke's officially gone.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.366
FRANKLIN: First thing in the
morning, we head up to Oakland.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.368
Get enough rock
to tide us over.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.203
(tires screech)

01:09.237 --> 01:10.271
(electricity crackles)

01:10.304 --> 01:11.739
I'm sorry about this, kid.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.807
-Who goes there?
-It's me.

01:13.841 --> 01:16.110
-Pedro?
-Hello, prima.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.752
Why are you here,
Pedro?

01:24.785 --> 01:26.086
That's not
the right question.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.889
I want to hear
your answer.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.924
No.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.994
The question is,
why did I leave?

01:34.027 --> 01:38.566
We know why you left.
You ran.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.768
We had to bury your father
without you.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.671
LUCIA: Deal with everything.
-I thought I was next.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.606
How fucking dare you?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.908
PEDRO: You know, at first, I
thought I was running from you.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.243
And you.

01:49.277 --> 01:52.246
But you know
what I figured out?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.248
I was running from myself.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.351
The fuck is wrong with you?
Are you high?

01:57.385 --> 01:59.753
Can I tell you a story?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.689
So...

02:01.722 --> 02:06.160
one night, I was in some
terrible bar in El Paso.

02:06.194 --> 02:09.129
In fact, it was
called the Hole.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.532
Two weeks of drinking
and blacking out.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.100
When I looked up, I had no idea

02:13.133 --> 02:15.369
where I was
or how I got there.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.306
But then, one of
the waitresses came by

02:18.339 --> 02:20.174
and started talking to me.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.142
I asked her why the bar
was called the Hole,

02:22.176 --> 02:25.179
and she said that it was
named after a local state park.

02:25.213 --> 02:28.649
And she said that it was
some sort of a sacred area--

02:28.682 --> 02:31.619
that Indians lived there
thousands of years ago.

02:31.652 --> 02:36.957
And then, I asked her out
to go see it with me.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.662
-So this is about a woman?
-Yeah, we began dating.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.798
She helped me dry out.

02:44.832 --> 02:48.336
-Helped me become a new man.
-You're so full of shit.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.003
Why are you really here?

02:50.037 --> 02:51.972
(exhales)

02:52.005 --> 02:54.041
I'm not here to fight, okay?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.879
To begin with, my money.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.218
My inheritance.
You have it, yes?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.819
I'll call Gutierrez
in the morning.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.322
-Should only take a day or two.
PEDRO: Okay.

03:08.356 --> 03:12.826
Once I have it, if you still
feel this way, we'll go.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.229
(tense music)

03:15.263 --> 03:18.599
-You brought her?
-Her name is Soledad.

03:18.632 --> 03:22.069
And yes, I brought her.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.505
Because we're going
to get married.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.740
*

03:26.774 --> 03:29.009
I'll call in a day or two
about the cash.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.580
*

03:32.613 --> 03:35.283
(water dripping)

03:35.316 --> 03:38.319
(lightbulb buzzing)

03:48.462 --> 03:50.431
(grunts softly)

03:54.435 --> 03:57.438
(chains rattling)

04:02.343 --> 04:06.146
Oh, shit.
What the fuck, man?

04:06.179 --> 04:09.650
Oh, Franklin,
you stupid motherfucker!

04:17.124 --> 04:21.295
Leon, Leon, that you?
Leon, wake up.

04:21.329 --> 04:25.232
Come on, Leon.
Leon, Leon, wake up!

04:25.265 --> 04:28.602
Leon! (panting)
Fuck.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.274
Hey, hey, hey!
Down here!

04:34.308 --> 04:35.643
(door unlocks)

04:35.676 --> 04:36.977
(door opens)

04:37.010 --> 04:39.980
(eerie music)

04:40.013 --> 04:47.020
*

04:49.790 --> 04:51.659
What the fuck is this?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.897
Who are you?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.301
You can't hear me
talking to you, motherfucker?

05:01.335 --> 05:03.103
Who are you?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.138
(breathing heavily)

05:10.678 --> 05:13.280
What you want from us, man?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.484
Huh, what you want from us?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.519
You fucked up, Franklin.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.301
Louie!

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
(dog barking)

05:41.274 --> 05:43.577
God damn.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.981
Franklin.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.385
Hey, Franklin.
Anybody here?

05:51.419 --> 05:53.353
In here.

05:53.387 --> 05:56.557
(cartoons play on television)
You in there?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.361
(laughs)

06:04.031 --> 06:08.536
-You seen Franklin?
-Mm-mm.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.571
Where Louie at?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.376
(laughter)

06:19.079 --> 06:20.848
You don't know nothing.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.550
(laughs)

06:29.222 --> 06:32.760
(coughs)

06:35.262 --> 06:37.264
(groans)

06:39.399 --> 06:40.400
Hey.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.204

06:44.237 --> 06:45.906
-Hey, Franklin.
-Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.576
(exhales)

06:48.609 --> 06:50.077
What the fuck is going on?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.212
I don't know, man.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.748
Aw, hell no, man.
I fucking pissed my pants.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.450
(grunts)

06:56.484 --> 06:59.787
-Hey, where were you grabbed?
-I was walking home,

06:59.820 --> 07:01.421
and some white dude
asked me for directions,

07:01.455 --> 07:04.625
but...

07:04.658 --> 07:06.226
I don't know, man.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.428
Shit, I'm fucked up, cuz.

07:08.462 --> 07:11.599
-You get a good look at him?
-No, not really.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.001
My motherfucking head hurt.
(groans)

07:14.034 --> 07:15.803
(coughing)

07:15.836 --> 07:18.472
(man whistling)

07:18.506 --> 07:20.908

07:20.941 --> 07:22.843
Hey, how many are out there?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.145
(stammering) I don't know.
I only saw one.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.647
(whistling)

07:30.183 --> 07:32.252
(whistling)

07:32.285 --> 07:33.987
You punk motherfucker.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.423
On my momma, I'm going
to kill you when I get loose.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.959
You hear me, you fucking worm?
I'ma kill you!

07:41.729 --> 07:44.464
(whistling)

07:44.498 --> 07:46.299
(whispering)
Come on, come on, Franklin.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.703
Come on, Franklin.
Come on, come on, Franklin.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.740
(whistling)

07:55.142 --> 07:57.511
What the fuck is this?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.613
What the fuck are you
going to do with that?

07:59.647 --> 08:00.848
What the fuck--ow, fuck!
(electricity crackling)

08:00.881 --> 08:02.315
Hey, hey, stop!

08:02.349 --> 08:04.217
Hey, hey!
Stop, man.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.318
Tell me about the bust.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.520
-(groans)
-What?

08:06.554 --> 08:07.988
-Tell me about the bust.
-The bust?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.990
-Tell me about the bust.
-What bust?

08:10.023 --> 08:11.525
-Oh, fuck.
-At Avi's.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.993
-Avi?
-Tell me about the bust,

08:13.026 --> 08:14.361
-Franklin.
-What's this got to do

08:14.394 --> 08:16.396
with Avi, man?
It was nothing, man.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.166
We showed up to Avi's to buy,
fucking cops showed up, we ran.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.168
-That's it.
-Oh, yeah, that's right.

08:21.201 --> 08:25.138
-Right, and you got away.
-Right.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.140
But he didn't.
Right?

08:27.174 --> 08:30.010
He didn't get away.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.680
And yet, somehow...

08:32.713 --> 08:35.749
24 hours later, he's out.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.384
Free as a bird.
How?

08:37.417 --> 08:38.919
-What, you think he snitched?
-Explain that.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.320
-He didn't snitch, man.
-Hey, kiss my ass.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.889
I ain't talk to
no motherfucking police.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.657
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

08:43.691 --> 08:47.527
Look, man, look, hey.
Look, look, whoever you are,

08:47.561 --> 08:50.030
I swear to you, I swear to you,

08:50.063 --> 08:51.665
I don't know shit
about how Avi got busted.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.200
What did he tell the police?
I think you do know.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.835
Say it.
Faster, faster, faster, faster.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.537
Look, I don't know, man.
But Leon didn't snitch.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.540
All right, check with the
courts, you don't believe me.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.510
Check with the courts, man.
Check with the courts.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.378
(heavy panting)

09:05.412 --> 09:07.180
He got charged
with felony evading.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.182
He got charged
with felony evading, man.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.884
(heavy breathing)

09:10.918 --> 09:12.586
And I bailed him out.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.856
And he didn't snitch.
He's got a lawyer.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.958
A court date.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.396
It's all legit.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.565
It's all legit,
I swear to you, man.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.976
Hmm.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.151
I'll check.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.794
We'll see, okay?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.074
You best back the fuck up
with that shit.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.911
Oh, I would love it if you
would do that one more time.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.479
Do it again.

10:12.512 --> 10:15.448
(panting)

10:17.350 --> 10:20.487
You are the stupidest person
I've ever met.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.622
Fucking weirdo.

Fucking light.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.234
And your name, too?

LEON: I don't know,
but we've got to get

11:08.736 --> 11:10.971
the fuck up out of here.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.473

fucking die down here.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.544
I ain't going to let us die.

Hey, Franklin.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.756
Come on, man.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.825
I don't want to be stuck
in no fucking traffic, dog.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.728
Hey, where the boy at?
He still asleep or something?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.030
Thought he went up to Oakland
with you already.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.866
Fuck you talking about,
Jerome?

11:38.899 --> 11:42.369
-I'm right here, nigga.
-Hold on.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.873
Ain't nobody even seen
Franklin today?

Hey.

Y'all know where Leon's at?

11:49.943 --> 11:52.746
Oh, hell no.
Excuse me.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.248
Ain't he with Franklin?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.464
Yeah, you the only bitch

13:17.497 --> 13:19.967
who come to buy rock
wearing a power suit.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.635
What you want, a 20 again?

13:22.669 --> 13:25.839
No, I want more.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.108
A lot more.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.310
Can you connect me
with your boss?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.312
How much more?

13:32.345 --> 13:37.117
As much as you can supply.
Wholesale.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.519
That's my name.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.022
Lucia Villanueva.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.057
Tell your boss we
could help each other out.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.727
Can't leave
and go see my bosses

13:47.760 --> 13:49.696
until all this shit
is sold.

13:49.729 --> 13:53.233
But you could speed things up
if you finish me off.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.037
Okay.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.671
I'll clean you out,
as long as you go

13:58.705 --> 14:00.307
and take my number
to him right now.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.209
(scoffs)

14:02.242 --> 14:03.843
How much more we got left?

14:03.877 --> 14:06.713
Ah...
quarter field.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.383
25 rocks, $250.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.722
Here you go.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.826
You know what, here's
an extra 50 for your time.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.062
(chuckles)

14:22.095 --> 14:24.064
Appreciate it.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.433
(engine starts)

14:42.582 --> 14:44.117
Hey.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.487
Thought you'd be at work.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.591
I was just leaving.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.594
-You seen Franklin?
-Why would I see Franklin?

14:54.627 --> 14:56.363
I haven't seen him in months.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.098
Well, he said he was going
to come by here,

14:58.131 --> 14:59.967
drop off you some groceries.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.269
Yeah, about them groceries,
you tell him to stop.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.104
This ain't his house no more.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.073
Oh, and I hope
you weren't feeling like

15:06.106 --> 15:08.976
you were going to waltz in up
there like it's your own home.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.011
(engine starts)

15:13.746 --> 15:15.515
(chuckles)

15:32.499 --> 15:34.434
Everything okay?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.739
Yeah.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.841
Yeah, everything good.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.014
I'll talk to you later.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.627
FRANKLIN: Where the hell
is this motherfucker, man?

16:00.660 --> 16:02.129
How long has it been?

16:02.162 --> 16:04.297
LEON:
Shit, too long, my nigga.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.366
Going fucking crazy.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.668
FRANKLIN: This is all
on me, man. I'm sorry.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.337
LEON: No, my nigga.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.005
I never thought life
would be this good.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.840
And it's worth
whatever's coming.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.675
And that ain't on you.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.459
You're right.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.529
Leon Simmons was arrested
for evading and resisting.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.864
Out on bail.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.666
We already told you that,
dumbass.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.734
Now let us the fuck go.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.972
Oh, where the fuck
is he going, man?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.541
Hey, just be cool, man.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.178
Just relax, man.
We going to get out this shit.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.181
(tense music)

16:54.214 --> 16:55.815
*

16:55.848 --> 16:57.717
Hey! Hey, what you doing,
what you doing, man?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.352
LEON: You just said we were
telling the fucking truth!

16:59.386 --> 17:01.221
Yeah, no, I believe that
you're telling the truth.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.655
That'll help me sleep.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.923
But now,
you've both seen my face.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.325
-And that won't--
-I can't see--

17:05.358 --> 17:07.327
I can't see your fucking
face, man, I can't--

17:07.360 --> 17:09.096
My nigga, it ain't need
to go down like this.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.930
FRANKLIN: Look, man, we still
don't know who you are.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.332
Huh, we still
don't know who you are.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.766
Won't tell a soul
about this shit.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.402
Come on, you have to think
I'm pretty stupid

17:15.435 --> 17:17.404
-to believe that, wouldn't you?
-Okay, look.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.739
I've got a ton of fucking cash.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.741
Huh, I've got a lot of money.
I could offer you--

17:21.774 --> 17:23.210
That's not worth it to me.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.877
(tense music)

17:24.911 --> 17:26.679
Then what is?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.748
See, if you knew the answer
to that question,

17:28.781 --> 17:30.583
you might be of some use to me.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.752
But seeing as how you're not
even smart enough to figure out

17:32.785 --> 17:34.787
who I am, I'm afraid
there is no benefit

17:34.821 --> 17:36.356
to me letting you live.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.091
-Do you work for Avi?
-No.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.726
Man, if you don't work
for Avi,

17:39.759 --> 17:41.394
then why the fuck
do you care if we snitched?

17:41.428 --> 17:43.230
LEON: Hey, man,
fuck it, Franklin.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.132
Piece of shit going to put us
down like dogs, fuck him.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.400
-Shut the fuck up, Leon, man!
-You're trying to stay alive?

17:47.434 --> 17:49.068
-That's not the way.
-Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.471
Come on, Franklin.
Think about it.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.805
I'm going to shoot him.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.541
Gonna put a bullet
in his brain.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.376
-Who am I, Franklin?
-You thought I knew you.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.611
-Who am I?
-You're the connect!

18:08.155 --> 18:10.157
(heavy breathing)

18:26.373 --> 18:28.341
You're the plug.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.481
The guy we was looking for.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.162
You're trying to cut Avi out?

18:52.031 --> 18:54.634
That's bold.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.836
I mean, it's stupid,
but it's bold.

18:56.869 --> 19:01.341
Well, Avi's a crazy person,
and he upped the prices.

19:01.374 --> 19:04.677
It's stupid to want to pay less
and deal with somebody sane?

19:04.711 --> 19:06.679
No, Franklin,
it's stupid to trust

19:06.713 --> 19:08.715
a stoner kid to get it done.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.818
-Whitey got a point.
-Shut up, man.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.456
Look,

19:16.489 --> 19:20.159
you've lost a buyer,
and I'm out of my supply.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.694
Why don't we help each other?

19:21.728 --> 19:24.564
(laughs)

19:24.597 --> 19:26.399
Come on.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.336
You were selling dimebags

19:29.369 --> 19:30.870
on the street corner
six months ago.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.405
You're going to
take Avi's place?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.874
I'd like to try.
How much you selling to Avi?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.576
A lot more
than you can move, kid.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.845
At the right prices,
I could move six a week, easy.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.547
Eh, six won't even
make a dent.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.215
Ten, then.
T...

19:44.384 --> 19:46.085
Ten a week.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.622
Hmm?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.693
That help you out?

19:55.061 --> 19:56.763
How are you going to move
ten keys in a week?

19:56.796 --> 20:00.267
Put that away...
and I'll tell you.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.070
(tense music)

20:04.103 --> 20:06.439
Convince me,
and I'll put it away.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.047
(Latin music playing on radio)

20:15.081 --> 20:16.549
I just heard
something funny.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.518
Would you just
put it down, already?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.086
Just put it down,
just put it down.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.589
What'd I do?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.524
Dude, you want me
to fucking put it down?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.759
Then put your money
where your mouth is, then.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.094
All right, fine, fuck it.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.562
All right,
let's go, let's go.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.097
Let it rain!

20:31.130 --> 20:35.935
*

20:35.968 --> 20:38.971
(indistinct chatter)

20:41.140 --> 20:43.610
Can we talk?

20:43.643 --> 20:45.645
Sure.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.250
-Can we talk inside?
-Here is good.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.655
-You hear from Gabriella?
STOMPER: Yup.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.292
I'll have the first load
in the next couple of days.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.294
Just want to make sure
you'll be ready to go.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.463
Where the fuck did you even
find that shit?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.532
Pico-Union.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.335
GUSTAVO:
A couple of young mayates.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.075
STOMPER: Mayates, huh?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.210
She also tell you I'm done
paying the other tax?

21:19.312 --> 21:21.314
No, she didn't mention it.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.883
You sure?

21:25.518 --> 21:27.687
The tax stays.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.955
Unless you want
the street to know

21:28.988 --> 21:30.357
it was us that hit your family.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.194
Now take your gorilla,
and get the fuck out of here.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.102
And once we figured out how

21:43.135 --> 21:44.704
to rock it up
and sell it cheap,

21:44.737 --> 21:47.139
we were selling more and more.

21:47.173 --> 21:49.376
We got dealers spreading out
all over my neighborhood,

21:49.409 --> 21:51.210
and we expanding every week.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.280
What do you do
with your cash?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.849
Storing it for now.

21:56.883 --> 22:00.152
I've been growing the business.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.955
-Security?
-We got plenty.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.691
LEON: Fuck is this?
A job interview?

22:04.724 --> 22:06.826
You got supply, we want to buy.
What more is there?

22:06.859 --> 22:08.961
He's just being careful.
Wants to know if we for real.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.997
Which we are.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.034
What is the high like?
This rock?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.537
FRANKLIN: Short and intense.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.674
Then you need more right away.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.876
-You speaking from experience?
-Nah, man.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.378
I don't deal
with none of that shit.

22:34.754 --> 22:38.057
You'll never turn me down.
No excuses, no bullshit.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.659
I show up with ten keys,
you buy ten every week.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.428
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.697
And you see what happens
to people who fuck with me?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.866
Uh-huh.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.836
Hey, we good?
Because I've got to go to

22:49.869 --> 22:52.238
the fucking bathroom,
or I'ma piss my pants.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.776
(toilet flushes)

23:01.113 --> 23:04.050
FRANKLIN: Enjoy taking a shit?
-Stupid.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.788
(coughs)

23:08.821 --> 23:10.823
(grunts)

23:12.625 --> 23:14.427
Here.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.463
Put that on.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.566
I trust you both understand
why this place

23:19.599 --> 23:21.434
needs to be kept secret.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.641
-What's your name?
-Richard Nixon.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.446
I'm kidding.
It's Reed Thompson.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.247
FRANKLIN: Reed Thompson.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.717
And how do I get in contact
with you, Reed Thompson?

23:37.750 --> 23:39.786
You don't.
I contact you.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.921
Uh-huh.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.656
Well, you know,
that don't work for me.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.625
I'm sorry.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.627
We talking a lot
of money and product, man.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.629
You know everything about me,
I don't know shit about you.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.297
Yeah, that's because
you don't need to know

23:51.330 --> 23:53.099
anything about me
except that I can supply you.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.434
-Where'd you get your product?
-Why?

23:55.468 --> 23:57.970
-So you can cut me out now?
-Come on, man.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.006
Put yourself in my shoes.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.309
You get T-boned, electrified,
thrown in the shithole,

24:03.342 --> 24:05.277
gun in your face, and now what?

24:05.311 --> 24:07.747
You're just supposed to go
along with some crazy-ass deal?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.649
How am I supposed to trust you?

24:09.682 --> 24:12.785
-Trust is overrated.
-Not to me.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.420
Are you always going to be
this big a pain in my ass?

24:14.453 --> 24:17.089
Yeah, he is.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.792
Look, you can't afford
to walk away from this deal.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.160
You don't have any leverage.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.095
Right, but I will
if I have to.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.766
(tense music)

24:26.799 --> 24:30.102
Help me sleep at night,
Reed Thompson.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.505
*

24:32.539 --> 24:33.873
Put the hood on.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.358
All right.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.561
I told you five times,
either one.

24:54.594 --> 24:57.997
Franklin Saint or Leon Simmons
in the emergency room.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.532
Checked in for injuries.
I don't know, man.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.300
I already asked Leon's momma.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.669
She ain't seen neither of them.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.070
And Leon
ain't say nothing about

25:04.103 --> 25:05.705
going up to Oakland
early with Franklin?

25:05.738 --> 25:07.039
Your ass would have
known about that

25:07.073 --> 25:08.541
if your ass
was around here to--

25:08.575 --> 25:09.976
Jerome, it ain't time
for that shit.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.378
-He's my goddamn nephew!
-My nephew, too!

25:12.411 --> 25:14.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.248
Maybe this ain't nothing
but Franklin

25:16.282 --> 25:18.250

last night, all right?

25:18.284 --> 25:20.920
Yeah, but Leon ain't get none
of this sweet thing last night.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.722
Where he at, huh?
Where Leon at?

25:22.755 --> 25:24.323
Yo, yo, what up?

25:24.356 --> 25:25.692
Nigga, I'm gonna pop
your fucking head off.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.426
Calm the fuck down!

25:27.459 --> 25:29.028
Listen, have y'all seen
Franklin since last night?

25:29.061 --> 25:30.730
-No, why, what's up?
-Fuck you doing here?

25:30.763 --> 25:32.331
We just had a little chica

25:32.364 --> 25:33.666
try to buy our product
ho-sale.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.768
Is you trying to say
"wholesale," nigga?

25:35.802 --> 25:36.836
That's what I said.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.238
A ho, wanting to make a sale.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.741
Anyways, look, she said
she can make us all rich.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.176
Lucia Villanueva.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.412
Bought from us on Pico-Union.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.214
Pico-Union.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.349
What you doing
selling in Mexicans' area?

25:50.382 --> 25:51.751
Because they buying,
big time.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.219
Ain't nobody
selling stuff over there.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.721
There's a reason for that.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.723
We don't fuck
with no goddamn Mexicans.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.691
I thought I told you
that before.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.227
-Go easy on my relative, man.
-No, this what you need to do.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.129
Tell all your little
fucking corner boys

26:03.162 --> 26:05.264
stop fucking selling to the
goddamn fucking Mexicans!

26:05.297 --> 26:06.933
Who is you
raising your voice to, man?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.801
Get your fucking ashy asses
out my goddamn house!

26:08.835 --> 26:11.604
-What's wrong with you, man?
-Fuck you looking at, fat boy?

26:11.638 --> 26:12.872
What's wrong with you, man?

26:12.905 --> 26:13.940
Get the fuck
out of here, man.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.441
This is your fucking fault!

26:15.474 --> 26:16.743
You need to learn
how to hold shit down.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.110
Shut your bitch ass up.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.646
You shut your
bitch ass up, nigga.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.781
Spending all that time
at the goddamn club.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.116
-Leon!
ROB: You look like shit, man.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.551
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Leon,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.553
-Where were you, baby?
-(stammering)

26:27.586 --> 26:29.555
-Where's Franklin?
WANDA: Are you hurt?

26:29.588 --> 26:31.223
Leon, where the fuck
is Franklin?

26:31.257 --> 26:32.625
-Hey, man, where's Franklin?
WANDA: Are you hurt?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.293
We all good, all right?
We all good.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.928
I just need to change
my clothes, and shower.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.797
But Franklin on his way.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.467
You smell like piss, man,
where you been at?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.803
Hey, Jerome, man,
get some towels or something.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.172
(tense music)

26:46.205 --> 26:49.642
Franklin need to walk through
this door right fucking now.

26:49.676 --> 26:53.680
*

26:59.118 --> 27:00.619
(soft Latin guitar music)

27:00.653 --> 27:05.457
(woman singing
moodily in Spanish)

27:05.491 --> 27:12.498
*

27:20.039 --> 27:23.475
GUSTAVO: (speaking Spanish)

27:32.885 --> 27:37.556
Lucia, this is my novia,
Soledad.

27:42.561 --> 27:45.832
Pedro, she's beautiful.

27:45.865 --> 27:46.966
(laughs)

27:46.999 --> 27:49.501
(both speaking Spanish)

28:01.113 --> 28:02.414
-(chuckles)
-He says that

28:02.448 --> 28:03.850
I have to practice English,

28:03.883 --> 28:06.719
so I can do both.
I go back and forth.

28:07.754 --> 28:11.223
Okay, well, which one's
better for you to tell us

28:11.257 --> 28:14.560
the stories about
you and Pedro, the new man?

28:16.262 --> 28:18.197
(speaking Spanish)

28:19.766 --> 28:21.934
Shall we take this inside?

28:32.945 --> 28:35.948
(speaking Spanish)

28:41.821 --> 28:43.923
Thank you,
it's still fairly new,

28:43.956 --> 28:46.458
but we're settling in.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.397
(speaking Spanish)

28:51.430 --> 28:56.235
-Oh, she loves it.
-It's very big. (laughs)

28:56.268 --> 28:58.070
But I, um...

28:58.104 --> 28:59.806
I can see how you could
live a good life here.

28:59.839 --> 29:04.610
I mean, everything, you know?
It's beautiful.

29:07.814 --> 29:12.919
You know,
once Pedro has his money,

29:12.952 --> 29:15.587
you can live anywhere.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.457
Have any life you want.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.992
Lucia...

29:22.428 --> 29:25.664
Pedro wants his money
because it is his money.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.635
And because...

29:29.668 --> 29:33.973
he wants to have his own life.
He's his own man now.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.641
LUCIA: On that note...

29:35.674 --> 29:37.810
(liquid pouring)

29:37.844 --> 29:40.412
To, um...

29:40.446 --> 29:42.248
to being your own man.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.316
Salud.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.018
Salud.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.558
Oh, delicioso!

29:54.693 --> 29:56.695
(indistinct chatter)

29:59.665 --> 30:02.434
TEDDY: Hey, Matt.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.170
Matt, I want you to meet
a new customer.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.505
This is Franklin.
Franklin, this is Matt.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.207
He's my pilot.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.182
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.250
You wanted to know
how we bring it in...

30:19.651 --> 30:23.222
This your own plane?

30:23.255 --> 30:25.157
How far does it fly?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.894
Well, with the weight
stripped out,

30:27.927 --> 30:31.563
and the auxiliary fuel tanks,
about 2,200 nautical miles.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.699
Give or take.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.701
Far enough.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.472
How y'all two
know each other?

30:40.506 --> 30:43.509
Uh, we met at the bar
of this little café

30:43.542 --> 30:45.344
up near the Agua Dulce Airport.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.413
You ever been up there?
Antelope Valley?

30:47.446 --> 30:49.048
-Nah.
-He was flying these bullshit

30:49.081 --> 30:50.816
scenic tours for tourists.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.418
Yeah, and he was screwing
one of the waitresses.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.520
-Now, he flies the loads.
-And he jerks off.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.288
(laughs)

30:59.225 --> 31:01.560
Have you ever been up
in one of these small planes?

31:01.593 --> 31:04.030
No, man,
never been on a plane.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.832
MATT: Hold on a second!

31:06.865 --> 31:10.702
You have not experienced
the greatest thrill

31:10.736 --> 31:12.738
a man can have besides,
obviously,

31:12.771 --> 31:15.374
banging a regional airport
cocktail waitress?

31:15.407 --> 31:17.076
Well.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.578
(soft music)

31:19.611 --> 31:21.580
Shit's about to change.

31:21.613 --> 31:28.620
*

31:31.590 --> 31:33.892
You always drink
when you fly?

31:33.926 --> 31:35.094
Always.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.031
How's this thing
stay in the air?

31:39.065 --> 31:40.766
Uh...

31:40.799 --> 31:43.869
-luck, mostly?
-Physics.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.538
Ah, physics.

31:46.572 --> 31:50.309
-Ever crash?
-Oh, yeah.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.878
-All the time.
-He's kidding.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.613
Listen, kid, relax.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.983
Nobody does anything
better than I fly.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.453
(grunts)

32:01.487 --> 32:04.223
41 Foxtrot to tower,
request permission to taxi

32:04.256 --> 32:06.225
to two seven left.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.826
MAN (over radio):
Tower to 41 Foxtrot,

32:07.859 --> 32:09.628
cleared to cross
runway two seven left.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.697
41 Foxtrot, thank you.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.302
MATT: Hold on, boys.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.173
MATT: Here we go.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.678
MAN (over radio): Tower
to 41 Foxtrot, radar contact.

32:26.712 --> 32:30.249
Fly heading two three zero.
Climb and maintain 2000.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.251
41 Foxtrot to tower,
heading two three zero,

32:32.284 --> 32:33.585
climbing and maintaining
2000 feet.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.154
Thank you, tower.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.922
41 Foxtrot, AMF out.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.458
-Ay, who he talking to?
-Hawthorne Tower.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.660
But we get far enough out,

32:41.693 --> 32:43.762
and we check in
with someone else.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.665
MATT: Yup, you are never alone
when you're up here, Franklin.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.869
Don't ever say this country
doesn't have its moments.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.339
But they tracking you
the whole time?

32:53.372 --> 32:55.007
TEDDY: Yup.

32:55.041 --> 32:58.044
But there are ways around it
if need be.

32:59.878 --> 33:01.313
Yeah.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.315
Going low is the main way.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.383
(screams)

33:04.416 --> 33:06.852
(laughing) What the fuck!

33:06.885 --> 33:08.654
(all yell)

33:08.687 --> 33:11.057
(laughter)

33:11.090 --> 33:13.059
FRANKLIN: Oh, man.

33:13.092 --> 33:16.962
Please don't do that again.
What the fuck, man?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.130
I think he likes it.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.965
(laughter)

33:19.998 --> 33:22.000
Oh, man.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.802
So after you
pick up the product--

33:23.835 --> 33:25.371
TEDDY; Hey, Franklin.
FRANKLIN: How you bring it back

33:25.404 --> 33:27.873
-to the country?
-Ask me one more question.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.708
I'm going to throw you out
of this fucking plane.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.743
(laughs)

33:33.712 --> 33:37.549
-I could do this all day.
-That's why I fly.

33:37.583 --> 33:41.053
You can be up here,
and not down there.

33:41.087 --> 33:44.556
This...(inhales deeply)
This is freedom, man.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.758
(soft music)

33:46.792 --> 33:48.827
Matt wanted to fly
before he could walk.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.497
*

33:51.530 --> 33:53.999
Go ahead, take the yoke.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.734
-Nah.
-Yeah.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.769
Grab that fucker right now.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.105
-Not that!
-Ah!

33:59.138 --> 34:00.406
I'm just kidding.
Grab that.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.707
Grab it, man.
Grab it, we're fine.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.109
-Go ahead.
-What?

34:03.142 --> 34:05.411
Come on, fly
this plane, pilot.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.678
All right, I got it.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.214
MATT: Whoo-whee!

34:08.247 --> 34:10.082
We got a pilot here, boys!

34:10.116 --> 34:12.218
(laughs)

34:12.251 --> 34:15.020
Yeah, running
South Central, baby!

34:15.053 --> 34:17.123
Stop yelling, stop yelling.
I got you on the headset.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.590
(both yell)

34:18.624 --> 34:20.592
Oh, man.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.594
I can't believe this shit.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.296
(swelling music)

34:24.330 --> 34:25.731
FRANKLIN: I'm flying
this motherfucker.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.566
You see me, Reed?

34:36.074 --> 34:39.211
FRANKLIN: Here's good, man.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.746
TEDDY: You don't want me
to drop you at the house?

34:40.779 --> 34:42.881
FRANKLIN: (scoffs)
Nah, it's fine.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.917
So, a couple days,
you'll be ready?

34:45.951 --> 34:49.455
Mm-hmm, ten keys.
Ten grand a key.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.757
And, I'll, uh,
I'll pay to fix the car up.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.826
No, I don't need it.
Just need your product.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.303
Hey, look, man.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.574
I understand why you did
what you did today.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.609
I do.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.944
From here on out, no games.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.513
No tricks, no bullshit.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.148
You be straight up with me,

35:16.182 --> 35:18.083
I'll be straight up with you.

35:18.116 --> 35:22.020
But if you ever fuck with me...

35:22.053 --> 35:24.490
or anybody that I care about...

35:26.858 --> 35:28.527
then it won't be good for you.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.129
You understand that?

35:34.666 --> 35:37.303
Yeah.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.470
I do, Franklin.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.377
Reed Thompson.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.020
(television playing
indistinctly)

35:58.424 --> 35:59.558
LOUIE:
You're the one responsible

35:59.591 --> 36:01.293
for getting him in this mess.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.161
I mean, you know, you gotta
keep this shit tight.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.331
Otherwise, I mean,
what are we really doing?

36:05.364 --> 36:07.666
KEVIN: They had pictures of me.
FRANKLIN: Hey.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.134
JEROME: Ho!
KEVIN: There he is.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.069
-Hey.
JEROME: God damn, nephew.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.804
ROB: Where you been, man?
LOUIE: Oh, my God.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.173
-I got a story for y'all.
-Yeah, Leon told us.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.543
Yeah, that's just
the half of it.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.045
We about to move
into the big leagues.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.313
KEVIN: By trusting
that white guy

36:21.347 --> 36:23.181
that kidnapped
your ass, huh?

36:23.215 --> 36:25.817
FRANKLIN:
Yeah, something like that.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.587
Guess that mean I'm going to
be cooking a lot more, huh?

36:28.620 --> 36:31.022
Mm.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.924
It means we all got to step up.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.927
(apprehensive ringing)

36:35.961 --> 36:41.900
*

36:41.933 --> 36:43.269
LUCIA: She's going
to love it here,

36:43.302 --> 36:44.603
no matter what
she says about you.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.245
She's tough.

36:53.279 --> 36:55.847
Tougher than you think.

36:55.881 --> 36:59.084
PEDRO: Business going well?
LUCIA: It has its challenges.

37:00.919 --> 37:04.790
How much does she know
about what we do?

37:04.823 --> 37:07.259
She's going to be my wife.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.461
She knows what I know.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.962
You trust a woman
you've only known

37:10.996 --> 37:14.266
-a few months with all that?
-Yes.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.403
And you should, too.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.375
Gutierrez will have
your money at 9 AM.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.943
Then you can go.

37:27.846 --> 37:31.583
You know,
Soledad is right about me.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.753
I want to do my own thing.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.955
El Paso is a great place
to start.

37:36.988 --> 37:40.225
-Good luck there.
-No, this is home, LA.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.328
I leave now, everything
that we did was for nothing.

37:44.129 --> 37:46.097
And what did we do, Pedro?

37:46.131 --> 37:47.633
We both hired Gustavo
to take that money.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.868
We both wanted
to be in cocaine.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.405
My father's blood is every bit
as much on my hands as yours.

37:53.439 --> 37:56.241
I'm here now.
We're here.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.177
And I want to run
what we created.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.912
I thought you
just wanted your money?

38:00.946 --> 38:03.615
No, I spent
too much time alone.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.151
I want to be part of a family.

38:06.184 --> 38:09.287
Think about it, please.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.425
Why don't you try sticking
your head up your ass?

38:13.459 --> 38:15.293
-See if it fits?
-No, nigga.

38:15.327 --> 38:18.096
You need that fucking side look
with the fat tongue, man.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.666
It's...

38:20.699 --> 38:23.669
Why don't you try
sticking your head up your ass?

38:23.702 --> 38:25.103
See if it fits, huh?

38:25.136 --> 38:26.505
Where'd you hide your stuff?

38:26.538 --> 38:27.939
Ay, ay, that's it.
You already know.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.942
(Latin music playing)

38:30.976 --> 38:35.347
*

38:35.381 --> 38:37.516
DELROY: ...that Nissan 720.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.317
*

38:39.351 --> 38:41.052
DELROY: Ooh, pull up to the Shaw
with a gang of bitches

38:41.086 --> 38:43.021
on the back.
You feeling me, brother?

38:43.054 --> 38:46.458
VICTOR: Look, man, maybe we can
catch that late showing tonight.

38:46.492 --> 38:49.160
DELROY: Ah, shit, we almost
done yet though?

38:49.194 --> 38:51.196
VICTOR: Almost.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.834
VICTOR: Hey, customer.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.503
Hey, hey.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.170
Hey, what you looking for?
We got what you need.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.139
Man, wait, oh, shit, oh, shit!

39:01.172 --> 39:05.210
(grunting and yelling)

39:05.243 --> 39:06.578
VICTOR: Get off him.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.680
Back the fuck up!

39:08.714 --> 39:11.049
(both grunting)

39:11.082 --> 39:14.052
(gasping)

39:16.955 --> 39:20.358
(choking)

39:24.295 --> 39:26.197
(rasping)

39:26.231 --> 39:28.434
(spluttering)

40:01.933 --> 40:03.935
(doorbell rings)

40:29.461 --> 40:30.829
Hey, Momma.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.433
I spoke to Jerome.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.469
I'll stop the groceries.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.339
Glad to hear it.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.808
But you know,
I was thinking maybe

40:42.841 --> 40:45.343
I could take you out
for dinner sometime.

40:45.376 --> 40:49.147
Huh, what's that fancy place
you was telling me a while back?

40:50.716 --> 40:53.284
I know what you've
been doing, Franklin.

40:56.488 --> 40:59.691
I've seen the new activity
at Jerome's.

40:59.725 --> 41:03.194
New people.
New cars.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.534
I know it's not just weed
anymore.

41:13.204 --> 41:17.208
Remember when I was a kid?

41:17.242 --> 41:19.410
You used to
tuck me in at night.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.483
Ask me about
the best part of my day.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.985
Why are you
saying this, Franklin?

41:27.018 --> 41:29.220
I was--
I was just remembering.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.623
Those times when I was a kid,
and I'd be having

41:31.657 --> 41:34.726
a really big day, and...

41:34.760 --> 41:36.161
and I'd want to
remember everything

41:36.194 --> 41:38.063
to tell you that night.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.900
Momma.

41:45.871 --> 41:50.075
-Today was one of them days.
-No, Franklin.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.543
(sniffles)

41:53.411 --> 41:55.246
"No."

41:57.215 --> 41:59.084
(softly)
No.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.455
You know how I feel
about all of this.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.564
You're welcome home
when you stop.

42:18.804 --> 42:20.739
Hey, Momma, hey!

42:20.772 --> 42:22.774
(exhales)

42:28.747 --> 42:31.750
(knocks)

42:31.783 --> 42:34.185
Momma!

42:34.219 --> 42:36.187
(soft soulful music)

42:36.221 --> 42:38.590
(exhales heavily)

42:38.624 --> 42:41.026
Please, Momma.

42:41.059 --> 42:44.462
(crying softly)

42:44.495 --> 42:47.699
WOMAN: * If you've ever

42:47.733 --> 42:50.301
* Lived

42:50.335 --> 42:52.638
* In a ghetto

42:52.671 --> 42:55.540
*

42:55.573 --> 42:58.543
* It may be

42:58.576 --> 43:00.712
* At the close

43:00.746 --> 43:04.582
* Of your day

43:04.616 --> 43:07.152
(singers vocalizing softly)

43:07.185 --> 43:10.055
* On your front porch

43:10.088 --> 43:13.091
* You hear the sound

43:13.124 --> 43:15.961
* Of a jukebox

43:15.994 --> 43:17.996
* Or

43:18.029 --> 43:24.269
* From a neighborhood

43:24.302 --> 43:27.005
* Café

43:27.038 --> 43:30.108
* Mm-mm

43:30.141 --> 43:32.610
* At noon

43:32.644 --> 43:35.446
* You may hear

43:35.480 --> 43:38.616
* Neighbors cussing

43:38.650 --> 43:41.419
(singers vocalizing softly)

43:41.452 --> 43:44.522
* When a kid

43:44.555 --> 43:46.758
* Breaks

43:46.792 --> 43:49.861
* A window pane

43:49.895 --> 43:51.262
What are you doing here,
Franklin?

43:51.296 --> 43:53.598
I'm sorry, I...

43:53.631 --> 43:57.468
I just wanted to thank you
for the card.

43:57.502 --> 43:59.971
For remembering.

44:00.005 --> 44:05.310
*

44:05.343 --> 44:07.879
Look, I...

44:07.913 --> 44:10.716
had a...(chuckles)

44:10.749 --> 44:12.483
A strange day.

44:12.517 --> 44:15.386
And I just wanted to apologize.

44:15.420 --> 44:19.324
You know, really apologize
for what I did to you.

44:19.357 --> 44:22.160
*

44:22.193 --> 44:26.965
-It's all right.
-No, no, it's not.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.666
You know,
I'm starting to realize

44:28.700 --> 44:32.037
that you got
one job in this life...

44:32.070 --> 44:34.672
and that's to protect
the people you love.

44:34.706 --> 44:36.674
*

44:36.708 --> 44:38.476
And I didn't do that for you.

44:38.509 --> 44:42.047
* But when you're born

44:42.080 --> 44:44.916
-And I'm sorry.
-* The child, the child

44:44.950 --> 44:48.019
* Of a poor man

44:48.053 --> 44:50.221
* Ooh

44:50.255 --> 44:52.891
* They say the ghetto

44:52.924 --> 44:55.761
-* Is the only
-Get in here.

44:55.794 --> 44:57.595
-Your pops. Nah.
-* Place for you

44:57.628 --> 44:59.030
Double shift tonight.

44:59.064 --> 45:00.932
But forget the window.
Come through the door.

45:00.966 --> 45:02.500
I ain't ever been
through your door,

45:02.533 --> 45:04.402
-and I ain't about to start now.
-What? (laughs)

45:04.435 --> 45:06.838
MEL: Oh, my God. Franklin!
FRANKLIN: Oh, shit!

45:06.872 --> 45:09.841
(soft vocalization)

45:09.875 --> 45:13.879
*

45:13.912 --> 45:17.015
* And I'm satisfied

45:17.048 --> 45:18.850
* Satisfied

45:18.884 --> 45:22.420
* Oh, that there will be

45:22.453 --> 45:24.856
* Ooh

45:24.890 --> 45:27.759
* For when they build
