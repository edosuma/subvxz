Hi, Moon.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.080
Tsst!

00:43.440 --> 00:45.760
-Must be a good book, huh?
-Uh huh.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.199
So good!

00:49.000 --> 00:49.800
[gasps]

00:51.040 --> 00:51.919
Phew.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.800
Ollie! I finished my book.

00:54.919 --> 00:57.640
And I learned so much about mermaids!

00:57.760 --> 00:58.640
Great!

00:58.760 --> 01:01.640
Wanna go to the library with me
to get another book?

01:01.760 --> 01:04.720
Sure, sure.
But first, I want to meet a mermaid.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.440
[screeching halt]

01:06.560 --> 01:07.960
Meet a mermaid?

01:08.320 --> 01:10.840
You mean a half-fish, half-girl
like this one?

01:10.960 --> 01:12.759
Uh huh! Did you know mermaids

01:13.000 --> 01:15.560
do a special dance together in the water?

01:15.679 --> 01:16.759
A mermaid dance!

01:17.640 --> 01:20.399
I want to meet one
and ask her to teach me!

01:20.520 --> 01:22.119
See? I already have the costume!

01:22.520 --> 01:25.759
But Moon,
you do know mermaids aren't real,

01:25.880 --> 01:27.600
so you can't really meet one.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.839
What?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.600
Sorry, missed that.
[gasps]

01:30.720 --> 01:33.520
Ollie, I am having such a brainstorm!

01:33.920 --> 01:36.280
But every time you have a brainstorm,

01:36.399 --> 01:38.320
I get dragged off somewhere.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.320
Yep! Let's go to Denmark!

01:40.679 --> 01:42.759
Denmark! Why there?

01:43.080 --> 01:45.640
That's where the Little Mermaid
in my book is from!

01:45.759 --> 01:48.360
You pack while I get my mermaid wig.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.960
Oof!

01:50.240 --> 01:51.320
But... [door shuts]

01:51.440 --> 01:53.080
mermaids aren't real!

01:55.199 --> 01:56.399
Psst, Ollie!

01:56.880 --> 01:59.800
You've got to tell her
that mermaids aren't real.

01:59.919 --> 02:03.160
I tried, but she didn't hear me.
And now she's too excited.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.520
If I tell her, it'll make her so sad!

02:05.640 --> 02:07.039
You've got to do it, Ollie.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.560
The longer you wait, the harder
it'll be when she finds out.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.840
Ta-da! Ready to go?

02:12.960 --> 02:16.040
Moon, there's something I need to...

02:16.160 --> 02:17.200
Mmmh! Oh, Ollie,

02:17.320 --> 02:20.799
You're such a good friend to help me
make my dream come true.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.400
Yeah...
[gasps]

02:22.519 --> 02:24.480
I sure am...
[sighs]

02:24.600 --> 02:25.560
Ah!

02:34.160 --> 02:35.600
Whee!

02:46.079 --> 02:49.079
<i>Now arriving in Denmark!</i>

02:52.920 --> 02:56.320
There it is, Ollie!
The Little Mermaid Statue from my book!

02:57.040 --> 03:00.160
This must be where mermaids hang around
and do mermaid stuff.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.280
And dance !

03:02.440 --> 03:04.600
Uh really? You think so?

03:04.720 --> 03:05.760
Of course!

03:05.880 --> 03:09.200
If I were a mermaid,
this is exactly where I would come.

03:09.359 --> 03:12.359
So... where are the real live mermaids?

03:12.519 --> 03:13.600
I don't see any .

03:13.760 --> 03:14.720
[sighs]

03:14.880 --> 03:16.480
Moon? Ahem.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.239
[sighs] Here goes.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.040
The reason we're not seeing
mermaids is because...

03:21.799 --> 03:22.840
[gasps]

03:23.200 --> 03:24.320
Whoa!

03:26.120 --> 03:28.440
Because we don't have that!

03:31.280 --> 03:34.519
Look! That toy vendor sold me this gizmo.

03:34.679 --> 03:36.600
It can call all kinds of creatures.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.920
And there's even a setting to call a...

03:40.079 --> 03:42.480
-Guess!
-Walrus. Marmot.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.560
-Blobfish?
-Mermaid!

03:46.160 --> 03:48.200
I had a feeling. Listen, Moon...

03:49.000 --> 03:51.119
It's a cool gizmo, but...

03:51.280 --> 03:54.399
you know it's a toy, right?
It's not gonna work.

03:55.079 --> 03:57.959
Wow. Lot of instructions.

03:58.079 --> 03:59.359
"While button A is flashing,

[gulps]

04:24.240 --> 04:26.400
You're the one who called them!

04:26.520 --> 04:28.159
Ah!

04:35.120 --> 04:36.479
That was fun!

04:37.280 --> 04:39.159
Let's see. Maybe this...

04:39.960 --> 04:41.360
[beeping]

04:42.640 --> 04:43.560
Wahoo!

04:43.680 --> 04:45.479
I think you found the sheep call!

Sorry. That was a bad idea.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.400
[giggles]

04:58.520 --> 05:00.800
You know what? Let me try.

05:01.599 --> 05:02.640
[rooster crowing]

05:02.800 --> 05:03.840
[barking]

05:03.960 --> 05:05.360
Mmhm. There.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.599
This one is the mermaid call.

05:07.719 --> 05:09.960
But, I still don't think it'll work.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.719
Huh. Let me try again.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.760
It didn't work.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.719
Where are all the mermaids?

05:19.880 --> 05:23.000
[sigh]
Moon... I have something to say.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.360
Sure, Ollie. What's up?

05:25.560 --> 05:28.479
Do you think maybe your book was... wrong?

05:28.599 --> 05:31.280
What if there aren't
any mermaids in Denmark?

05:31.440 --> 05:32.280
Excuse me.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.880
I just noticed
your amazing mermaid costume.

05:35.039 --> 05:36.960
Are you here for the mermaid dance, too?

05:37.080 --> 05:38.200
Why, yes!

05:38.320 --> 05:39.240
See, Ollie?

05:39.359 --> 05:42.200
I told you Denmark
was the place for mermaids.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.240
She's come here for them, too!

05:44.359 --> 05:47.880
Yes.
But I've lost my mermaid costume, a tutu!

05:48.000 --> 05:49.520
Could you keep an eye out for it?

05:49.640 --> 05:50.479
Sure we will!

05:50.599 --> 05:51.520
If you find it,

05:51.640 --> 05:54.880
I'll be at the Amalienborg Palace,
of course. Bye!

05:55.039 --> 05:56.520
Amalien... what?

05:56.640 --> 05:57.599
What's that?

05:57.719 --> 05:58.440
I don't know.

05:58.599 --> 06:01.719
But that rabbit just gave me
a mermaidy brainstorm!

06:02.120 --> 06:04.800
We know this is where you find mermaids,

06:04.919 --> 06:07.320
but they're not coming when we call...

06:07.520 --> 06:11.560
so they must be too far out
in the water to hear us.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.159
We should go someplace high with a view

06:14.280 --> 06:15.560
way out into the water.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.440
Then when we see a mermaid,

06:17.560 --> 06:20.280
we go to her! Brilliant, right?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.960
-Well...
-Come on!

06:23.120 --> 06:25.320
This is nice and high. What is it?

06:25.440 --> 06:26.840
"Round Tower.

"Famous for star gazing
and rooftop views."

-Perfect!
-Wait.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
Rooftop views?

06:34.479 --> 06:37.120
-Whee!
-But I'm afraid of heights!

06:37.240 --> 06:39.840
We are so high up!

06:39.960 --> 06:40.919
Yes!

06:44.520 --> 06:47.120
I still don't see anything. Do you?

06:47.440 --> 06:48.840
Not a thing!

06:49.120 --> 06:50.440
[sighs]

06:50.560 --> 06:51.760
Moon?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.200
You see...

06:53.320 --> 06:55.080
I have to tell you something.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.240
I do see! A mermaid!

06:57.359 --> 07:00.039
-You do?
-Look! It's mermaid hair!

07:00.320 --> 07:01.960
Just like mine!

07:02.240 --> 07:04.719
It does look like your wig... But...

07:04.919 --> 07:07.200
Mermaid! Let's go meet her!

07:12.080 --> 07:12.960
There!

07:13.320 --> 07:16.239
If we swim straight out,
we'll slosh right into her!

07:16.400 --> 07:18.080
Ready to swim, Ollie?
[gasps]

07:18.200 --> 07:19.440
In the water?

07:19.919 --> 07:22.880
But it's... wet, with water!

07:23.000 --> 07:24.919
Wet... wet water!

07:27.080 --> 07:27.919
[he yells]

07:28.080 --> 07:29.520
Hmm, yeah...

07:29.640 --> 07:31.919
You don't like getting wet, do you?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.039
[gasps]

07:33.159 --> 07:35.760
Don't worry! I know just what to do.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.960
Stilts? Why stilts?

07:40.120 --> 07:41.960
So we can walk out into the water

07:42.120 --> 07:44.400
and meet a mermaid
without getting you wet.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.159
Follow me, Ollie!

07:51.960 --> 07:53.200
We're getting close.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.239
Uh!

07:54.400 --> 07:56.640
Ah! Oh! Wah! Oh!

07:57.320 --> 07:59.679
[Moon]
Can you see her? Is she beautiful?

08:02.280 --> 08:03.719
Moon...

08:03.880 --> 08:05.880
-I have some bad news.
-So do I!

08:06.039 --> 08:07.280
You're gonna get wet!

08:07.440 --> 08:08.479
I'm gonna get wet!

08:09.400 --> 08:11.479
Ah! Uh, ah!

08:11.640 --> 08:13.719
Ah!

08:15.919 --> 08:17.359
Ah.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.479
Almost there.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.560
Almost there! Almost...

08:29.799 --> 08:31.760
[sigh]
It was just seaweed!

08:31.919 --> 08:35.000
I wanted it
to be a mermaid so much, Ollie.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.039
But I'm starting to think
maybe there's no such thing as mermaids...

08:39.159 --> 08:43.039
Maybe I just liked my book so much
I wanted them to be real, you know?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.760
I'm sorry, Moon.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.079
I've been trying to find a way
to tell you.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.720
[gasps]
What's that?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.120
[gasps]
It's that rabbit's tutu!

08:52.280 --> 08:54.760
Come on, Ollie!
Maybe we didn't find a mermaid,

08:54.920 --> 08:57.319
but at least we can help our new friend!

08:59.880 --> 09:02.480
Aha! Amalienborg Palace.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.720
This is where she said to bring it!

09:04.840 --> 09:05.680
Fancy!

09:05.840 --> 09:08.560
It should be. The royal family lives here!

09:08.720 --> 09:12.600
Looks like some kind of event.
Keep your eye out for her.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.720
Poor rabbit.

09:13.839 --> 09:16.680
I wonder if she knows
mermaids aren't real.

09:17.079 --> 09:18.640
I'm sorry you're sad, Moon.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.000
But mermaids are still cool,
and fun and...

09:22.120 --> 09:23.640
right here!

09:23.760 --> 09:27.319
Ollie. You don't have to
try to cheer me up. It's...

09:27.439 --> 09:28.959
[gasps]
Mermaids!

09:29.079 --> 09:31.240
And they're doing the mermaid dance!

09:32.520 --> 09:33.920
You're just in time!

09:34.079 --> 09:36.760
[gasps]
And you found my tutu!

09:38.000 --> 09:38.959
Thank you!

09:39.640 --> 09:40.480
Well?

09:40.600 --> 09:42.920
Are you ready to dance
the <i>Little Mermaid </i>ballet?

09:43.360 --> 09:45.160
There's a <i>Little Mermaid </i>ballet?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.640
Ha! Of course, silly willy!

09:47.760 --> 09:49.480
Denmark's famous for it.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.199
Isn't that why you're here
and all dressed up?

09:52.360 --> 09:53.720
To do the mermaid dance?

09:53.880 --> 09:56.720
Well, I did want to dance with mermaids

09:56.839 --> 09:58.640
But then I found out...

09:58.760 --> 09:59.800
they aren't real.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.880
Yeah!

10:01.040 --> 10:02.319
But that's OK.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.680
It's still fun to dance like one, right?

10:04.800 --> 10:08.280
Actually, yeah. I guess so!
Come on, Ollie!

10:50.400 --> 10:51.760
What was this one about?

10:51.959 --> 10:53.000
Dragons!

10:53.160 --> 10:55.719

10:55.839 --> 10:57.120
[sighs]

10:57.240 --> 10:58.920
[Moon laughs]
