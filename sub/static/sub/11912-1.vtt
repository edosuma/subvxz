No offense.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.118
Oh, all right.

13:47.202 --> 13:51.540
Look. Ricardo Manoso,
likes to be called Ranger.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.709
- Call him in the morning.
- Ranger?

13:54.335 --> 13:56.128
What is he, an action figure?

13:57.087 --> 14:00.924
<i>Ranger Manoso, the Lord God guru
of bounty hunting.</i>

14:01.342 --> 14:04.845
<i>He looks like Michelangelo

14:04.928 --> 14:06.221
<i>and strapped some heat on him.</i>

14:06.889 --> 14:09.099
Did I catch you in the middle
of a tour of duty?

14:09.224 --> 14:11.143
Yuk it up. If it had been me
who clocked Morelli,

14:11.226 --> 14:12.561
I'd be sitting on 50 grand right now.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.606
- How are those fries?
- They're not bad.

14:16.273 --> 14:19.234
Excuse me, can I get some ketchup?
Thanks.

14:19.610 --> 14:21.445
So I did a little recon.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.323
The guy Morelli killed, Ziggy Kuleska,
he was moving heroin.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.117
But you knew that already, right?

14:27.201 --> 14:30.412
Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that a little hard
on your stomach?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.708
How come you're not going after Morelli?

14:34.792 --> 14:38.754

things like that. None of your business.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.966

14:43.467 --> 14:44.760
It just seems a little acidic, is all.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.595
And, you know, food is fuel, so.

14:46.637 --> 14:49.181
You're out of your league.
You need to respect that.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.519
A, he's a cop, B, he put a bullet
in Ziggy Kuleska's head

14:53.644 --> 14:55.521
and we don't know the circumstances.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.689
Except for C, he was off-duty
and he used a personal weapon

14:57.773 --> 14:59.483
with a .45 Hydra-Shok.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.570
- You even know what that is?
- It's a gun. I'm not an idiot.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.406
A bullet.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.575

the size of a potato.

Hey, I have as much right to go after
Morelli as anybody.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.911
You don't know anything about the case.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.038
I know the victim's name is Ziggy Kuleska.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.207
I know he was shot by an off-duty Morelli.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.376
I know the judge posted
bail at half a mill,

19:27.417 --> 19:29.294
and I know Vinnie decided to
put the money up, thinking,

19:29.378 --> 19:30.504
"Joe, he's not gonna screw me."

19:30.587 --> 19:32.923
Wrong. He skips and, as of yesterday,

Morelli was holed up on the third floor
of the Gold Cup factory

19:35.759 --> 19:37.135
with access to a borrowed car.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.137
So now he's probably long gone.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.431
- Proud of yourself?
- Very.

- You're going after him, aren't you?
- Damn skippy.

She's a working girl, mostly Stark Street.

- Says she called him for help.
- Yeah, Morelli got to her apartment,

20:12.129 --> 20:13.755
says Ziggy fired on him first.

20:13.797 --> 20:14.881
He's claiming self-defense.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.675
Trouble is, Carmen's not around
to corroborate.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.552
Says there was another guy there.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.970
Yeah, we can't find him either.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.305
And there's zero evidence
Ziggy ever had a gun.

How can I help you if you're not

23:16.605 --> 23:20.191
- He killed a guy named Ziggy Kuleska.
- Ziggy Kuleska.

23:21.276 --> 23:22.319
You know, when I first met him,

23:22.402 --> 23:23.987
I didn't know which name
to make fun of first.

23:24.029 --> 23:26.489
What a ridiculous name, huh?
What a dirt bag.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.825
He tried to horn in on
one of my deals with a fighter.

23:28.909 --> 23:31.244
- Benito Ramirez?
- Yeah, Benito.

23:31.328 --> 23:34.414
I took in Benito when he was just a kid,
14 years old.

23:34.497 --> 23:37.667

Carmen.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.558
Look, can I be honest with you?

what to do with Benito.

23:56.519 --> 23:57.729

23:57.854 --> 24:00.899
Look, I wish I could be more help to you,
but I gotta go.

24:02.943 --> 24:06.404
You know, I'd drop this if I were you,
because these guys got a taste for violence,

24:06.488 --> 24:08.865
which I personally don't condone,
but what are you gonna do?

24:08.907 --> 24:10.033
You know what I mean?

24:17.707 --> 24:19.125
Mr. Ramirez?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.171
Get up.

24:25.966 --> 24:28.343
- Who are you?
- I need to ask you a few questions.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.388
Then you need to step into my office.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.061
Does he need help?

24:43.525 --> 24:46.903
My name is Stephanie Plum.
I'm a bond-recovery agent.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.905
Pretty fancy title.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.075
Wow! That's quite a grip.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.329
Jimmy Alpha told me to talk to you.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.918
You need me to beat the shit
out of somebody?

25:02.043 --> 25:05.714
No. Thank you.
That's a very nice offer, though.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.299
I'm trying to find Carmen Sanchez.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.844
Then we have a lot to talk about. Let's go.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.892
- Okay.
- What's your problem?

25:17.934 --> 25:19.936
You know what? I'm supposed to
be meeting Sergeant Gazarra

25:19.978 --> 25:22.605
down at the station,
so I'm just going to get going.

25:25.108 --> 25:27.861

I'll cut you up and sell you for parts.

- Oh, God!

25:53.303 --> 25:55.472
- What the hell were you doing?
- Looking for you.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.892
Yeah, well, congratulations, you found me.
You also blew my cover.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.979
You got to stop grabbing at me.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.023
- Knock it off!
- Jesus Christ!

26:05.148 --> 26:07.817
I am so close to blowing your head off
right now, you don't even know.

26:07.942 --> 26:11.529
And who would blame me?
You shot an unarmed man, you skipped bail.

26:13.323 --> 26:14.491
Why are you still moving?

26:14.532 --> 26:15.825
'Cause I don't think you're gonna shoot me.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.535
Think again, Morelli.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.663
I don't have to.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.083
You could've shot Ramirez back there,
but what did you do?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.418
You hit him with your pocketbook.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.504
I, on the other hand,
have not provoked you in any way.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.881
As far as you're concerned,
I am always provoked.

26:30.006 --> 26:33.885
All right, correction.
I have not provoked you recently, right?

26:33.968 --> 26:36.721
Steph. Come on, will you?

26:37.680 --> 26:40.100
Would you please not shoot me? It's me.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.185
Would you please not shoot me?

26:44.437 --> 26:45.522
Fine.

26:45.980 --> 26:48.525
- Will you come into custody then?
- No.

26:48.733 --> 26:51.778
- You're a lunatic.
- God damn it, Joe! You owe me.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.280
I owe you? How do you figure?
I saved your ass back there.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.533
Saved my ass? I was fine.
I had it handled.

26:56.616 --> 26:57.909
The guy's been charged
with rape three times,

26:57.992 --> 27:00.286
and all three times he walked,
because the vics disappear.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.498
- Yes. So consider your ass saved.
- You're watching Ramirez? Why?

27:04.457 --> 27:05.708
You kidding me?

27:05.917 --> 27:08.545
I gave you my gun. Come on.
Give me something.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.884
- I'll give you something.
- Give me something I can use.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.597
All right, you got one question
because I feel sorry for you.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.266
Hurry up, make it good.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.894
Who's Carmen?

27:25.979 --> 27:27.689
- She's my informant.
- And?

27:27.730 --> 27:30.066
And, in exchange for information,
I protect her.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.735
I need to know what happened.
I owe her that.

27:33.736 --> 27:37.407
I think Ramirez made her disappear.
I had been watching from across the street

27:37.448 --> 27:39.576
trying to get a read on it,
until you came along

27:39.659 --> 27:41.369
and I had to blow the whole place up.

Here, don't monkey around with that.

That sweatshirt makes you look
like the Unabomber.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.254
Yeah, what can I say? I'm a wanted man.

Hey, so I gave you one question
back there, right?

- Jesus, Morelli! God!

01:13:41.168 --> 01:13:43.795
- It's a drop-boat, isn't it?
- Yup.

01:13:52.721 --> 01:13:55.265
You see that? That's heroin.

01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:58.477

No, Sal's boat was moving icing sugar.

God, you don't have to be an asshole
about it.

- Well, don't be stupid about it.
- I'm not being stupid.

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:10.322
- I've never seen heroin before.
- Use your brain.

01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:11.615
- Clearly you have.
- Of course it's heroin.
