10:57.350 --> 10:59.045
SO IF THE UNSUB
PUT THIS ON HER WINDSHIELD,

10:59.090 --> 11:01.217
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A RUSE TO GRAB HER

11:01.260 --> 11:02.318
BEFORE SHE COULD
DRIVE AWAY.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.248
HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
HER ROUTINE.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.985
A DESERTED PARKING
GARAGE AT NIGHT,

11:06.030 --> 11:08.396
IT WOULD BE EASY
TO TAKE SOMEONE
WITHOUT BEING NOTICED.

11:08.430 --> 11:10.864
THEY DIDN'T FIND
ANY TRACES OF BLOOD.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.265
MAYBE HE WANTED HER
UNHARMED.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.666
LET'S HOPE SO.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.004
I THINK THE LIBRARY
IS MY FAVORITE ROOM.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.204
HA HA HA! I PROBABLY
SHOULD BE USING
THE GYM MORE.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.377
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE TIME
FOR EXERCISE.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.719
DO YOU KNOW, I THINK
WHAT I'M MOST PROUD OF

11:27.750 --> 11:29.479
IS OUR VEGETABLE GARDEN.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.317
NOW, WE KNOW THIS IS
NOT WHAT YOU'RE USED TO,

11:31.350 --> 11:35.912
BUT AS A TALENTED CHEF,
WE'RE SURE THAT YOU
CAN MAKE IT WORK.

11:37.360 --> 11:41.194
HOW DO YOU...
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING ME?

11:41.230 --> 11:42.254
EVERYTHING WILL BE
EXPLAINED TO YOU

11:42.300 --> 11:46.839
IN THE SPECIAL VIDEO WE HAVE
FOR YOU TO WATCH. SO...

11:47.870 --> 11:49.167
UHH!

11:49.200 --> 11:51.065
I WANT OUT NOW.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.409
ALLIE, HURTING DR. CHILDS
OR ME OR ANY OF THE OTHERS--

11:54.440 --> 11:55.475
OTH ERS?

11:55.510 --> 11:56.841
IS POINTLESS.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.472
ACTIONS HAVE
CONSEQUENCES.

11:58.510 --> 12:02.469
NOW, LET DR. CHILDS GO
OR SUFFER YOURS.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.943
YOU WON'T GET OUT
THIS WAY.

12:04.990 --> 12:08.482
TRUST ME. I KNOW.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.496
[GASPING]

12:13.530 --> 12:16.226
PLEASE. PLEASE,
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

12:16.260 --> 12:17.989
DEAR...

12:18.030 --> 12:20.169
THIS IS YOUR HOME.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.239
HELLO, FRIENDS.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.838
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.087
I DON'T THANK
ANY OF YOU OFTEN ENOUGH.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.350
I KNOW YOU'RE
SEEMINGLY INANIMATE,

12:40.390 --> 12:42.950
BUT YOU WITNESS ALL
THE ICKY THAT I DEAL WITH,

12:42.990 --> 12:44.855
AND IT MAKES IT MORE MANAGEABLE,
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.482
AND YOU AND YOU AND YOU--

12:46.530 --> 12:47.929
WHAT IS IT, GARCIA?

12:47.960 --> 12:49.518
OH, YES, I LOOKED INTO
THE DISAPPEARANCE

12:49.560 --> 12:52.028
OF CHRISSY MILLER.
I FOUND SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT.

12:52.070 --> 12:54.129
THAT SAME WEEK
THAT CHRISSY DISAPPEARED,

12:54.170 --> 12:57.230
ANOTHER TEEN, KYLIE PRITCHARD,
ALSO WENT MISSING.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.204
18 AND PREGNANT.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.537
LIKE CHRISSY,
THE POLICE CHECKED OFF

13:00.580 --> 13:01.569
THE TROUBLED RUNAWAY BOX.

13:01.610 --> 13:04.499
YEAH. AND THIS WILL ALSO
WHET YOUR MYSTERY WHISTLE.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.314
DAYS AFTER KYLIE
AND CHRISSY WENT MISSING,

13:07.350 --> 13:08.977
DR. ROBERTA CHILDS VANISHED.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.487
SO IF THIS
IS THE SAME UNSUB,

13:10.520 --> 13:13.080
HE PROBABLY STARTED
WITH HIGH-RISK VICTIMS
LIKE RUNAWAYS,

13:13.120 --> 13:15.850
THEN GRADUATED
TO HIGH-PROFILE ONES.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.858
WHAT IF JOANNA MILLER
WAS RIGHT

13:17.890 --> 13:19.380
AND HER SISTER'S
DISAPPEARANCE

13:19.430 --> 13:21.990
IS CONNECTED TO THE ABDUCTION
OF THE PROFESSIONAL WOMEN

13:22.030 --> 13:23.099
FROM 5 YEARS AGO?

13:23.130 --> 13:25.269
GARCIA,
EXPAND YOUR SEARCH FOR--

13:25.300 --> 13:27.439
MISSING WOMEN IN VIRGINIA
AND THE METRO D.C. AREA.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.267
I CAN READ YOUR VOICES
AND YOUR MINDS.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.564
IN THE LAST 5 YEARS,
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO DOZEN

13:31.610 --> 13:34.431
MISSING PERSONS CASES,
MOSTLY RUNAWAYS
AND YOUNG FEMALES.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.005
SO WE HAVE TWO WAVES
OF ABDUCTIONS--

13:37.050 --> 13:39.974
TEEN RUNAWAYS
AND ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.318
DR. CHILDS
WAS A OBSTETRICIAN.

13:42.350 --> 13:45.444
WHAT IF SOME OF THE OTHER
RUNAWAYS WERE PREGNANT?

13:45.490 --> 13:48.357
JOANNA SAID CHRISSY
WAS CLEANING UP HER ACT

13:48.390 --> 13:51.223
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.
WHAT IF SHE WAS PREGNANT, TOO?

13:51.260 --> 13:52.557
GARCIA, CAN YOU--

13:52.590 --> 13:54.558
IN THE FLASHIEST OF FLASHES,
YES, I CAN. UH...

13:54.600 --> 13:57.569
YEAH. HERE'S A MEDICAL CHART
FROM A DOWNTOWN FREE CLINIC.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.090
CHRISSY WAS PREGNANT.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.995
TWO MONTHS, TO BE EXACT.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.531
OK, I GET THE UNSUB
TAKING TEEN RUNAWAYS.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.629
HE PROBABLY FIGURED
FEWER PEOPLE WOULD BE
LOOKING FOR THEM,

14:05.670 --> 14:08.901
BUT WHY GO OUT OF HIS WAY
TO ABDUCT PREGNANT ONES?

14:08.940 --> 14:11.943
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BABIES?

14:19.190 --> 14:22.557
UM, WHAT HAPPENED?

14:22.590 --> 14:25.525
YOU FAINTED.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.494
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

14:27.530 --> 14:30.658
JUST A SIMPLE EXAM.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.237
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT!

14:33.270 --> 14:34.897
GET THESE OFF OF ME!

14:34.940 --> 14:37.158
SOON.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.531
THIS IS WRONG
AND YOU KNOW IT.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.970
AH....

14:42.010 --> 14:43.671
DON'T--DON'T YOU HAVE
A FAMILY?

14:43.710 --> 14:45.268
A HOME?

14:45.310 --> 14:49.679
PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU,
WHO MISS YOU? I DO.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.110
THIS IS MY HOME NOW.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.986
WHO'S IN CHARGE?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.224
IRENE?

14:58.260 --> 14:59.682
THE MAN IN THE GAS MASK?

14:59.730 --> 15:02.153
DID THEY TAKE ME?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.497
YOU'RE A DOCTOR!

15:03.530 --> 15:06.124
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HELP PEOPLE!

15:10.310 --> 15:13.131
HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELF?

15:15.510 --> 15:19.378
5 YEARS AGO THE UNSUB
TAKES TWO PREGNANT TEENS.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.243
IT'S OBVIOUS WHY HE THEN
TAKES A OBSTETRICIAN.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.282
IF HE'S TAKEN
OTHER TEEN GIRLS
THROUGH THE YEARS

15:24.320 --> 15:26.311
AND KEEPING THEM ALIVE,
THEY'D ALL BE MOTHERS

15:26.350 --> 15:27.157
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN NOW.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.215
YEAH, MOTHERS AND
CHILDREN WITH NEEDS.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.420
MEDICAL, DENTAL,

15:30.460 --> 15:32.382
EDUCATIONAL, AND NUTRITIONAL.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.091
YEAH, AND WHO WOULD BE
BETTER CARETAKERS

15:34.130 --> 15:37.190
THAN A DOCTOR, DENTIST,
A TEACHER, AND A CHEF.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.460
WITH SUCH A LARGE GROUP,
HE'D NEED TO CONTROL THEM

15:39.500 --> 15:42.094
TO PREVENT ESCAPES
OR REBELLIONS.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.698
AND SOME COULD BE
STAYING WILLINGLY,

15:43.740 --> 15:46.334
OTHERS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID
OR FEEL THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.702
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
ALL OF THE REASONS
GIVEN BY EX CULT MEMBERS

15:48.740 --> 15:50.378
WHEN ASKED WHY
THEY DIDN'T LEAVE SOONER.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.071
THIS HAS THE ASPECTS
OF A CULT,

15:52.110 --> 15:54.010
BUT MEMBERS TYPICALLY
JOIN BY THEIR OWN VOLITION,

15:54.050 --> 15:55.312
NOT ABDUCTED.

15:55.350 --> 15:59.309
THERE'S NOTHING TYPICAL
ABOUT THIS CASE.

15:59.350 --> 16:02.717
WELL, YOU'LL FIND
A NEW OUTFIT IN YOUR ROOM.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.388
GET DRESSED
AND WE CAN SEE THE VIDEO.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.022
I DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF THIS.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.028
IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE,
YOU CAN'T MEET THE OTHERS.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.164
I WILL NOT HAVE YOU
UPSETTING THEM.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.326
[ALARM BLARES]

16:12.370 --> 16:13.268
WHAT'S THAT?

16:13.300 --> 16:15.165
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.078
WHAT IS IT?

16:23.110 --> 16:25.578
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF HER.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.452
LOCAL WALKING HIS DOG
NOTICED THE BODY.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.549
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE'S
BEEN HERE VERY LONG.

16:37.590 --> 16:41.629
ALVEZ: THE DISPOSAL SITE'S
INSIDE THE UNSUB'S
ABDUCTION ZONE.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.096
PROBABLY KNOWS THE AREA,
FEELS COMFORTABLE HERE.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.189
THIS CHANGES THINGS.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.367
DR. ROBERTA CHILDS.
5 YEARS OLDER,

16:51.410 --> 16:53.071
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY HER.

16:53.110 --> 16:54.805
THEY DIDN'T TRY
TO CONCEAL THE BODY.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.070
I MEAN, THEY COULD HAVE
HIDDEN HERE IN THE BRUSH
OVER THERE.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.042
MAYBE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.069
MAN: CAPTAIN?

16:59.110 --> 17:00.077
EXCUSE ME.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.076
HE COULD BE DEVOLVING.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.339
WRAPPING THE BODY
SUGGESTS THE UNSUB
CARED ABOUT HER COMFORT

17:05.390 --> 17:07.119
EVEN AT THE END
OF HER LIFE.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.788
SHE WASN'T STARVED.
MUSCLE TONE'S GOOD,

17:09.820 --> 17:11.788
WHICH YOU WOULDN'T SEE
IN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
RESTRAINED

17:11.830 --> 17:13.195
FOR SO MANY YEARS.

17:13.230 --> 17:14.697
HER HAIR'S BEEN WASHED
RECENTLY

17:14.730 --> 17:16.254
AND CLOTHES ARE CLEAN.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.824
YOU THINK THE UNSUB
STAGED THIS

17:17.870 --> 17:20.338
TO LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE?

17:20.370 --> 17:22.759
IT'S UNLIKELY.
THIS WASN'T HER FIRST ATTEMPT.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.099
SO THE BANDAGES
WERE SOMEONE ELSE'S
ATTEMPT TO SAVE HER.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.131
SHE'S BEEN ALIVE
ALL OF THIS TIME.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.478
AND THAT FACT BODES WELL
FOR THE OTHER MISSING WOMEN.

17:30.510 --> 17:32.239
ASSUMING THEY'RE STILL ALIVE,

17:32.280 --> 17:34.077
THE SUICIDE
OF A LONG-TERM CAPTIVE

17:34.120 --> 17:36.179
COULD CAUSE DISSENT
AMONG THE GROUP.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.346
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

17:37.390 --> 17:39.779
YEAH, GARCIA.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.811
ANOTHER WOMAN
HAS BEEN TAKEN.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.124
DAMN IT, IRENE,
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

17:44.160 --> 17:45.388
SHE WAS GONNA TRY
TO KILL HERSELF AGAIN.

17:45.430 --> 17:46.783
WE KNEW THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN

17:46.830 --> 17:48.718
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
PLANNING YEARS AGO.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.466
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
REMEMBER.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.762
WHAT IS DONE IS DONE.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.290
SHE BETRAYED OUR MISSION.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.093
BUT DID WE HAVE TO
DUMP HER BY THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD

17:56.140 --> 17:59.564
LIKE SHE WAS TRASH?
ROBERTA HAS BEEN A PART
OF OUR LIVES

17:59.610 --> 18:00.679
FOR 5 YEARS.

18:00.710 --> 18:02.837
YOU WRAPPED HER
IN A BLANKET

18:02.880 --> 18:05.098
AND THAT WAS MORE
THAN SHE DESERVED.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.175
I NEED TO TELL
THE OTHERS SOMETHING.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.145
WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T GET
THE SAME STUPID IDEA.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.489
IT COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.320
LAWRENCE,
YOU'RE NOT HAVING DOUBTS

18:18.360 --> 18:21.124
THAT IT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN, ARE YOU?

18:21.160 --> 18:25.119
I BELIEVE IT
MORE THAN EVER NOW.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.559
AS DO I.

18:28.700 --> 18:33.103
LET'S JUST MAKE SURE
THIS NEW ONE DOES, TOO.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.218
PRENTISS: WHAT DO WE KNOW?

18:42.250 --> 18:43.615
THE UNSUB STRUCK AGAIN,

18:43.650 --> 18:45.584
THIS TIME IN THE OPEN
IN A BUSY PARKING LOT.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.156
JJ AND TARA
ARE STILL THERE.

18:47.190 --> 18:48.714
THEY FOUND AN EYEWITNESS
THAT CAUGHT THE WHOLE EVENT

18:48.760 --> 18:50.318
ON A CELL PHONE.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.224
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS
HE'S NOT ABDUCTING

18:58.270 --> 18:59.828
AND DRIVING
AT THE SAME TIME.

18:59.870 --> 19:02.168
HE'S GOT A PARTNER.

19:06.310 --> 19:09.632
SIMMONS: HE TOOK A LOT
OF RISK ABDUCTING IN
BROAD DAYLIGHT LIKE THAT.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.672
HE LOOKED AT SOMETHING
BEFORE HE TOOK THE WOMAN.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.177
IT MADE HIM HESITATE.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.916
MATT, TAKE IT BACK.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.585
ROSSI: THAT BUILDING
IN THE BACKGROUND.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.282
IT'S A DIGITAL CLOCK.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.460
11:57 AND 30 SECONDS.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.718
HE WAITED UNTIL
THAT PRECISE MOMENT

19:32.770 --> 19:34.260
BEFORE HE GRABBED HER.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.836
YEAH, BUT THAT
WAS DURING THE DAY.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.566
ALL THE OTHER ABDUCTIONS
TOOK PLACE CLOSE
TO 12:00 MIDNIGHT.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.737
CLOCKS STRIKE 12:00
TWICE A DAY.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.248
MAYBE IT'S NOT A.M.
OR P.M. THAT MATTERS.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.772
THE NUMBERS 11:57:30 MIGHT
MEAN SOMETHING TO HIM.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.346
IT COULD BE AN ADDRESS,
A CODE,

19:48.380 --> 19:49.972
IT MIGHT EVEN HAVE
RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.511
GARCIA: POLICE I.D.ed
THE LATEST VICTIM.

19:52.550 --> 19:53.858
PAIGE BURRELL.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.778
PAIGE IS 35, SINGLE.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.618
GUYS, SHE'S
A PEDIATRICIAN.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.924
THE UNSUB LOST A DOCTOR,
SO HE TOOK A DOCTOR.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.928
A ONE-FOR-ONE SWAP.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.996
BUT HE STILL NEEDS
A DOCTOR'S SPECIFIC SKILL SET.

20:05.030 --> 20:07.294
WHICH MEANS THAT
OUR MISSING WOMEN

20:07.340 --> 20:09.490
AND THEIR CHILDREN
ARE STILL ALIVE.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.309
AGENT JAREAU,
I SAW THE NEWS.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.876
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN
WAS TAKEN?

20:16.910 --> 20:18.343
I GOT THIS.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.371
UH, LET'S--
LET'S JUST TALK OVER HERE.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.241
IS IT THE SAME MAN
WHO TOOK CHRISSY?

20:23.290 --> 20:25.349
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.279
WAIT.

20:28.320 --> 20:32.654
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
THE FBI NOW DOESN'T THINK

20:32.690 --> 20:33.998
MY SISTER RAN AWAY.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.952
JOANNA, THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO

20:36.000 --> 20:37.968
IS GIVE YOU FALSE HOPE.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.797
THERE'S BEEN SOME

A CONNECTION

WAS TWO MONTHS PREGNANT

20:58.390 --> 21:00.449
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED?

21:00.490 --> 21:02.913

SOMEWHERE.

A LOT.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.371
DOES HE STILL LIVE
IN THE AREA?

21:26.410 --> 21:29.447
NO. HE MOVED DOWN SOUTH
A WEEK BEFORE
SHE WENT MISSING.

OK, DID CHRISSY KEEP
A JOURNAL, A DIARY, A BLOG?

THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK.

THAT COULD HAPPEN.

HE'S BOUGHT
ALL OF THOSE THINGS,

30:33.660 --> 30:35.855
BUT ALSO CHLOROFORM
IS ON HIS SHOPPING LIST.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.221
I THINK I'D PREFER
THE MOUNTAINS.

41:08.260 --> 41:09.852
I'D BE WITH MY FAMILY.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.027
SAME. SPENCE?

41:12.070 --> 41:14.129
PARIS WITH MY MOM.
SHE LIKED PARIS.

41:14.170 --> 41:16.798
YOU SOMETHING TELLS ME
DAVE HAS THIS ALL PLANNED OUT.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.638
DON'T YOU KNOW IT.
WHEN THE END COMES,

41:19.670 --> 41:21.638
YOU'LL FIND ME AT HOME
ENJOYING A MEAL

41:21.680 --> 41:25.275
OF CARBONARA ALLA ROSSI,
AND IF THERE'S STILL TIME,

41:25.310 --> 41:27.244
I WILL ADJOURN TO MY PATIO

41:27.280 --> 41:29.669
TO PARTAKE IN A DOUBLE JACK

41:29.720 --> 41:32.280
AND A VINTAGE DON CARLOS.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.185
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

41:34.220 --> 41:36.757
YOU MIND
IF WE JOIN YOU?
