WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:11.803
All right, Wubbo.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.848
Let's take a look here, buddy.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.893
-Okay, follow the light for me.
-You're good.

00:19.603 --> 00:23.774
<i>I took shelter in the lava tube
right next to base camp.</i>

00:32.448 --> 00:34.618
Okay, Wubbo. Let's take a look.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.204
Muller, take care of Molly for me, okay?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.289
<i>I tried to reach Wubbo over the comm,</i>

00:39.373 --> 00:40.999
<i>but there was no response.</i>

00:41.959 --> 00:43.460
<i>And that was when the storm hit.</i>

00:43.544 --> 00:45.170
Molly, you okay?

00:45.254 --> 00:46.338
Step up. Step up.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.423
Right.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.134
Do me a favor. Put some...

00:51.927 --> 00:53.387
Molly, okay?

00:54.263 --> 00:57.599
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:02.563
<i>It was like... the regolith was boiling.</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:05.732
All right, Wubbo.
Let's see what we can do here, huh?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.235
All right. Come on.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.243
<i>I knew Wubbo was in trouble,</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:22.165
<i>but it wasn't safe to proceed
with the rescue until the storm was over.</i>

01:24.251 --> 01:25.252
So I waited.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.632
Two hours, 45 minutes. I waited.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.386
You made the right call, Molly.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.182
Will he be okay?

01:39.516 --> 01:40.809
There aren't really any tests

01:40.893 --> 01:44.646
that can tell us how much radiation
passed through his body during that time.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.524
But his dosimeter badge measured 200 rems.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.692
What does that mean?

01:48.775 --> 01:51.695
It's more than the maximum dose
any person should get in a lifetime.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.073
He will almost certainly develop cancer
in the next few years.

01:55.866 --> 01:59.369
I'm moving my return trip up to
tomorrow so I can get him back to Houston.

01:59.995 --> 02:00.996
Understood.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.790
And I'm taking you back with me as well.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.960
What? The hell you are.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.545
My badge was green.
I have two more months up here.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.841
That lava tube gave some protection,
but it wasn't ideal cover.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.886
The approved amount of radiation
for a six-month tour is 20 rems.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.054
Your dosimeter's at 90.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.307
Come on. I'm almost finished mapping
the southern ridge of Stafford.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.934
I know there's lithium there.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.939
I'm sorry. My decision is final.
We leave at 0900.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.483
That's so easy for you to say.

02:30.692 --> 02:35.072
You can't wait to get off this rock
and start your cushy new desk job.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.407
Nothing about this is easy, Molly.

02:39.451 --> 02:43.038
Once you're recovered, you'll come
back up. Six months, a year tops.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.541
And Wubbo?

02:47.251 --> 02:48.710
He's never coming back.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.833
The Reagan administration continues
to defend its decision to go to DEFCON 3

04:09.917 --> 04:11.752
during yesterday's solar storm.

04:11.835 --> 04:16.005
The escalation led to the 4th Bomber
Wing's deployment near Soviet airspace.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.135
Soviet premier Andropov
criticized the actions as provocative

04:20.219 --> 04:22.596
in a speech to the Duma earlier today.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.475
Administration officials claim
it was simply a cautionary measure.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.604
But a growing number of critics here
at home are questioning that rationale.

04:30.687 --> 04:35.943
If that's true, why'd they rush
the president onto Air Force One?

04:36.026 --> 04:39.446
A solar flare brought us
to the brink of war,

04:39.530 --> 04:42.741
thanks to the saber-rattling policies
of this administration.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.997
And how's the power situation holding up?

04:49.081 --> 04:50.666
<i>Solar's picking up most of the slack</i>

04:50.749 --> 04:53.210
<i>while we're getting
the nuclear reactor back online.</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:56.046
What about life support systems?
Got a lot of people up there.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.384
<i>Life support should be fine,
but ice mining output's been affected.</i>

05:00.467 --> 05:02.636
<i>And the advanced development operations
for the Mars program</i>

05:02.719 --> 05:05.597
<i>will have to be put on hold. Again.</i>

05:06.473 --> 05:10.352
<i>And that's not all. During the scram,
the fuel rods were damaged.</i>

05:10.435 --> 05:13.313
<i>We're not gonna get more than another
couple of months out of the reactor,</i>

05:13.397 --> 05:14.606
<i>if we're lucky.</i>

05:18.151 --> 05:21.321
Okay. We'll have to send up
more plutonium.

05:21.947 --> 05:22.990
It'll be tight,

05:23.073 --> 05:25.951
but I think the next Sea Dragon launch
should get it there in time.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.786
Certainly safer with an unmanned flight.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.914
I'll alert Guam to implement
nuclear transportation guidelines.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.458
That'll have to be approved
by the Pentagon first.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.545
That'll take weeks.
We'll miss the launch date.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.256
I don't want Jamestown
stuck in the dark because of red tape.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.259
I don't want that either,
Margo, but it is protocol.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.346
And we may be back to DEFCON 5,
but we still need to remain vigilant.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.434
Good morning. I come bearing good news.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.102
We could certainly use some.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.897
So, after this storm fiasco,

05:54.980 --> 05:58.984
the president thinks it's prudent
to ease tensions with the Soviets,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.903
show Americans he's a man of peace.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.866
Sticking missiles on <i>Pathfinder</i>
is probably not the best way to do that.

06:05.949 --> 06:10.162
I know. I know. That's on hold. For now.

06:10.245 --> 06:13.749
But I do want you to put together
a proposal for a new mission.

06:13.832 --> 06:17.211
An American astronaut
and a Soviet cosmonaut

06:17.294 --> 06:20.172
coming together to show our common purpose

06:20.255 --> 06:22.841
with a handshake in space.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.639
I'm sorry.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.932
A handshake?

06:30.015 --> 06:33.810
You dock the two ships, open the hatch,
they shake hands on live TV,

06:33.894 --> 06:35.145
Bob's your uncle.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.064
Ed, I'll need some ideas on the crew,

06:37.147 --> 06:40.067
people that best reflect
what our country is all about.

06:40.150 --> 06:44.488
Strength, freedom, maybe
a young face in there for the MTV crowd.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.533
Yeah. I'll see if Madonna's available.

06:48.116 --> 06:52.079
There is no way I'm allowing our shuttle
to dock with a Soviet craft.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.541
They'll have access to our most
classified technologies. We can't--

06:55.624 --> 06:58.502
Margo, relax. It won't ever get to that.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.798
We reach our hand out in peace,

07:02.881 --> 07:06.593
and when the Soviets smack it away,
we come out smelling like roses.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.595
And they look like the aggressors.

07:08.679 --> 07:09.888
It's a win-win.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.933
Tom, I'm not sure if you've noticed,

07:13.016 --> 07:15.018
but we've got
a lot on our plate right now.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.813
So planning a PR stunt
that's never gonna happen

07:17.896 --> 07:20.774
isn't exactly high on my priority list.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.192
You'll figure out something.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.070
It's what you do.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.202
It's what you do.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.584
Bet you're pretty excited to get down here
and join all the fun, huh, Ellen?

07:39.001 --> 07:40.085
<i>Yeah, can't wait.</i>

07:40.169 --> 07:41.336
Signing off.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.188
How we looking?

08:00.856 --> 08:02.649
LSAM's prepped for launch.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.110
Guess it's about that time then.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.574
This is gonna be
your last time up here, right?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.704
Gonna miss it?

08:15.787 --> 08:19.875
Four tours, 723 days.

08:20.626 --> 08:21.877
I've had my fill.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.714
Anyway, I think I can have more
of an impact on the program down there.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.468
Maybe start with getting us
a working dishwasher.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.928
I can't do the impossible, Al.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.011
Right.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.683
-Well, should we...
-Yeah.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.817
I hereby relieve you
as commander of Jamestown.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.237
I stand relieved.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.615
Good luck down there.

08:52.824 --> 08:53.825
Thanks.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.122
Foster. Thank you.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.249
Take care.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.043
Price. Keep up the good work.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.920
Fassi. Thank you.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.547
-Geller.
-Thank you.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.508
Good. Don't be too good to him.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.052
-Jonway.
-Thanks.

09:12.135 --> 09:15.347
And almost forgot
the most important thing.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.433
What are these for?

09:19.518 --> 09:20.727
The liquor cabinet.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.359
All right, ADI is to inertial.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.487
Yep.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.823
Check your errors and rates and medium.

09:33.490 --> 09:38.287
I'm gonna kick off the maneuver.
Item 27. Execute. All right.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.206
Cobb, time to strap in.

09:41.707 --> 09:42.708
All right.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.924
-Engine mode 202.
-202.

10:15.073 --> 10:21.121
Come on, you little alien bastards.
Yes. Yes.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.210
You might as well give up.
You're never gonna get it.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.962
Bullshit. I'm almost there.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.714
You're cheating.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.675
No, I'm not. It's called hunting.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.054
-Jimmy showed me.
-Proud of you, Gordo.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.639
Yeah.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.434
I was right there.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.853
-Right there.
-One day.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.980
One day you'll get it, buddy boy.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.109
Shit.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.407
Thanks.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.245
You think she'll show up?

11:02.955 --> 11:04.289
We'll see.

11:49.793 --> 11:53.046
"And when he came to it,
he found nothing but leaves,

11:53.130 --> 11:55.549
for the time of figs was not yet."

12:11.648 --> 12:13.609
I didn't really know him that well.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.070
Certainly had his demons.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.490
Some guys just
never get free of it, you know?

12:20.574 --> 12:22.534
It's like they're still over there.

12:23.452 --> 12:27.414
Poor Dani.
Can't imagine what she's going through.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.875
It's gonna take time,
but she'll get through it.

12:29.958 --> 12:34.129
Yeah. Just seeing her at the funeral,
that was like...

12:34.213 --> 12:35.214
Hey.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.590
-Hey, there she is.
-Hi, Bob.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.758
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Bob.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.011
Sorry I'm late. The I-45 was jammed.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.140
What the hell is that?

12:45.224 --> 12:48.185
-Plants in a bar. What's next, huh?
-I tried telling her.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.146
-What'd she say?
-She said it freshens up the place.

12:51.230 --> 12:54.066
Oh, please.
The place was fine the way it was before.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.275
Come on, it was a dump.

12:55.359 --> 12:59.238
Sure, it was a little rough around
the edges, but it was ours.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.199
-It had character.
-It had roaches.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.659
Roaches have character.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.662
-I miss the pool table.
-You never played the pool table.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.330
I loved the pool table and the old chairs.

13:08.413 --> 13:11.625
I loved those old chairs. The way
they would wobble ever so slightly.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.795
Yeah, you sure wobbled
out of plenty of 'em.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.930
How you holding up?

13:27.432 --> 13:28.433
I'm okay.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.855
-I just miss him.
-Yeah.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.941
Day by day. You know?

13:36.567 --> 13:37.568
Day by day.

13:41.238 --> 13:45.158
These last nine years,
they were just so hard.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.745
And Clayton,
seeing him struggle like that,

13:48.829 --> 13:51.415
and he was in so much pain.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.126
I just...

13:57.087 --> 13:58.422
You okay?

13:59.173 --> 14:00.174
I'm fine.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.303
Really, I'm just...
I'm trying to get back to my old self.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.013
Honestly.

14:08.599 --> 14:13.270
Which is... why I...

14:14.730 --> 14:15.731
What?

14:18.108 --> 14:19.193
I wanna go back.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.321
-Back where?
-Jamestown.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.741
It has been nine years since I've--

14:26.366 --> 14:30.037
since any of us have been up there, and...

14:30.871 --> 14:31.872
it's time.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.958
I wanna see how it's changed.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.044
I wanna see what it's become.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.714
You know what it's become.
You helped design the damn thing.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.799
That's not the same thing.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.969
I wanna see it. With my own eyes.

14:47.179 --> 14:48.931
I wanna suit up in the morning.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.683
Put my boots in the moondust.

14:52.351 --> 14:55.062
See the sun rise over Shackleton again.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.524
Don't y'all miss it?

15:00.150 --> 15:01.443
Come on, Ed.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.946
You're telling me
you don't ever think about going back?

15:04.029 --> 15:07.157
We were there before there was a "there."

15:08.116 --> 15:09.785
Don't y'all wanna see what we started?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.578
-Not really.
-No.

15:14.498 --> 15:15.499
Well, I do.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.044
Don't get me wrong.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.632
I love sitting here in this formerly
shitty bar with y'all every few weeks

15:23.715 --> 15:25.509
having a few laughs,

15:25.592 --> 15:28.929
but I'm tired of talking about
the good old days when we were astronauts.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.430
We're still astronauts.

15:31.932 --> 15:32.975
No, we're not.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.812
There's more to being an astronaut
than going up in space, Dani.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.021
Look...

15:39.064 --> 15:42.693
I don't regret a minute of the time I
spent here with Clayton these last years.

15:43.402 --> 15:47.114
But I will not spend the rest of my life
just sitting around saying,

15:47.614 --> 15:50.868
"You remember this? You remember that?"

15:51.869 --> 15:52.953
Okay.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.290
I'll put in the paperwork tomorrow.

16:00.919 --> 16:01.920
Really?

16:05.507 --> 16:06.633
Thank you, Ed.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.057
-To Dani.
-To Dani.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.322
Now raise your visor. Yeah, there we go.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.618
All right. Can you raise your arm now?

16:33.702 --> 16:35.704
Yeah, just show us that watch.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.498
Okay, okay. Now give me
that million-dollar smile.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.751
Little bigger.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.336
Nice.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.463
Okay.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.340
Guess that's good enough.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.467
Okay. We're done here.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.094
Thanks for rolling with me, babe.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.722
I know that took a while,
but those last few are really gonna pop.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.016
Your pretty face
is gonna be all over Times Square.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.519
I think you mean that pretty watch.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.816
Thank you, Angie.
I'm fucking boiling in this suit.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.248
Hey, baby.

17:20.457 --> 17:23.252
Jamestown was just
a single room back then.

17:23.752 --> 17:27.256
Barely enough space for
the three of us to live and work together.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.634
Not like the Taj Mahal
that they've got up there today.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.222
Don't even get me started on the food.

17:35.806 --> 17:38.058
Might as well have been eating cardboard.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.567
Yeah. It was the pioneer days.

17:48.110 --> 17:51.738
Frontier. The Wild West.

17:51.822 --> 17:55.158
We were the settlers, and the Russians...

17:55.784 --> 17:57.578
well, they were the Indians.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.350
Gordon.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.081
Welcome home.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.942
Thank you, everyone,
for all the work you've done

19:52.025 --> 19:53.986
to bring us back to Earth safely.

19:54.069 --> 19:58.532
There is no such thing
as a small part to play in this program.

19:58.615 --> 20:03.078
The work of every person here is valuable
to the greater mission of NASA,

20:03.161 --> 20:06.248
and we are very grateful.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.332
Thank you.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.591
Babe!

20:15.674 --> 20:17.843
Babe. Babe.

20:19.761 --> 20:20.762
Hey.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.606
-You okay?
-Yeah. Fine.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.610
-Let's get you outta here.
-Yeah.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.945
Yeah. Come on.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.614
-They won't even notice.
-Yeah.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.789
Kelly, breakfast!

20:54.213 --> 20:55.214
Kelly, come on!

21:05.057 --> 21:07.893
-Kelly! Breakfast.
-Coming.

21:29.790 --> 21:33.377
<i>Protests continue to grow
out of hand near the Panama Canal Zone</i>

21:33.460 --> 21:35.254
<i>after the Reagan administration declared</i>

21:35.337 --> 21:39.174
<i>the reelection of Panamanian president
Omar Torrijos invalid,</i>

21:39.258 --> 21:41.385
<i>alleging widespread voter fraud.</i>

21:41.468 --> 21:44.555
<i>Torrijos, who has recently embraced
socialist policies,</i>

21:44.638 --> 21:46.306
<i>vowed to stay in office,</i>

21:46.390 --> 21:48.267
<i>while peace activists here in the US</i>

21:48.350 --> 21:52.020
<i>are voicing opposition
to the administration's policies.</i>

21:52.104 --> 21:55.941
<i>If Ronnie Reagan thinks peace
is a cliché from the '60s,</i>

21:56.024 --> 21:57.025
<i>that's his problem.</i>

21:57.109 --> 21:58.944
<i>Peace is forever.</i>

21:59.027 --> 22:02.906
<i>Come on, Nancy. Tell your husband
to come back to bed and grow his hair.</i>

22:04.616 --> 22:06.034
6:20.

22:06.118 --> 22:08.662
-Time for me to go. Bye.
-Bye.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.582
Ellen, it was very nice to meet you.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.585
You too. Sure I'll see you around.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.878
Yeah. See you around.

22:15.961 --> 22:17.504
<i>...in the United States,</i>

22:17.588 --> 22:19.798
<i>it is estimated that
more than three million people</i>

22:19.882 --> 22:22.551
<i>have openly demonstrated
against the Reagan administration...</i>

22:23.010 --> 22:24.720
Wow, you've trained him well.

22:24.803 --> 22:27.222
Yeah, he's great. Always on time.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.018
Goes through the back
so Mrs. Williams won't see.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.312
He even parks his car two blocks away.

22:34.188 --> 22:35.272
Impressive.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.236
Larry Wilson, is this serious?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.281
It's...

22:46.283 --> 22:48.827
I mean... not really.

22:48.911 --> 22:51.622
I like him, but I don't know.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.832
Anyway, what about you?

22:54.333 --> 22:56.710
Now you're back down here for good,
you gonna make up for lost time?

22:56.793 --> 22:59.379
I have too much on my plate right now
with the new job and everything.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.757
Right, right.

23:03.592 --> 23:05.427
I better get to the office.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.180
Hey, did they agree to your raise yet?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.307
"While you are a valuable member
of our team,

23:10.390 --> 23:12.976
Boeing only considers
additional compensation

23:13.060 --> 23:16.813
during our annual
employment reviews in December."

23:17.606 --> 23:19.316
And I thought NASA was bureaucratic.

23:20.484 --> 23:23.028
Maybe I should just go back to bed
like John and Yoko.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.991
I should get going too.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.245
I almost forgot!

23:36.750 --> 23:40.462
For your first day, Deputy Administrator.

23:40.546 --> 23:41.588
Larry.

23:45.926 --> 23:47.094
You don't like it.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.972
No, it's beautiful. I just...

23:52.140 --> 23:53.267
I don't know.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.435
Is it me?

23:57.396 --> 24:00.524
You're gonna be hobnobbing
with congressmen and cabinet secretaries.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.900
You gotta look the part.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.822
Just remember why
you took this job to begin with.

24:07.698 --> 24:12.035
-The way to Mars isn't through Houston--
-Right. It's through Washington.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.204
That's my girl.

24:14.997 --> 24:17.207
-Have a great day.
-Thank you.

24:31.972 --> 24:33.056
Morning.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.744
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

24:54.328 --> 24:57.164
Very excited to have you over
on the administrative side, Ellen.

24:57.247 --> 25:00.167
Looking forward to it.
Hear you got the good coffee over here.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.878
Just don't go following
in his footsteps too closely.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.380
She could do worse, believe me.

25:06.215 --> 25:09.301
I'm sorry your first meeting
as deputy administrator

25:09.384 --> 25:11.970
is about something
as exciting as budgets, but...

25:12.054 --> 25:13.347
shall we get started?

25:27.945 --> 25:29.613
Now that things are calming down,

25:29.696 --> 25:32.074
we're gonna need to implement a retrofit
of Jamestown

25:32.157 --> 25:34.201
to better protect
against future solar events.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.994
That doesn't sound cheap.

25:36.620 --> 25:41.542
No, and unfortunately the only place
I can see to draw funds from, yet again,

25:41.625 --> 25:43.043
is the Mars program.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.254
We could kill the new Mars EMU.

25:45.337 --> 25:50.467
It's still early in its development,
so... I guess that makes sense.

25:50.551 --> 25:52.135
-Great.
-But-- I'm sorry--

25:52.803 --> 25:53.804
Isn't there...

25:53.887 --> 25:56.974
We're five years into the Mars program,

25:57.057 --> 25:59.101
and it's already ten years
behind schedule.

26:02.145 --> 26:06.149
I know I'm new to this part of it,
but there's gotta be another way.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.820
Mars is what this program
is all about. Pushing forward--

26:09.903 --> 26:11.655
We have to pick our battles here, Ellen.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.449
We can't just run to Congress
every time we need cash.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.618
But I appreciate your passion.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.996
We're gonna need it in the fights ahead.

26:19.872 --> 26:23.333
Okay, now that we're agreed
on cutting the EMU...

26:24.501 --> 26:28.255
Now can we push ahead
to this overage in the Geology Department?

26:28.338 --> 26:31.133
Do we really need all this money
for spectrometers?

26:31.216 --> 26:32.843
We...

26:34.261 --> 26:36.805
Would you just excuse me for one second.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.520
What's this about?

26:45.689 --> 26:49.693
Sorry, he was just saying it was
regarding... Aleida Rosales?

26:50.736 --> 26:52.321
Should I have known who that is?

26:52.404 --> 26:57.826
No, it's just someone I knew
from a long time ago. Thank you.

26:58.410 --> 27:01.997
...the Soviets are not cutting
their reconnaissance budget at Zvezda.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.501
I get it. But even with all
the new revenue from these patents,

27:05.584 --> 27:07.085
we're still stretched thin.

27:07.753 --> 27:10.380
Look, I'm open to anything.

27:10.464 --> 27:12.674
I just think we have to
be smart about this.

27:13.342 --> 27:14.676
Right, Margo?

27:15.969 --> 27:17.221
Margo?

27:31.276 --> 27:34.404
That's right.
There's a new class starting today.

27:35.906 --> 27:37.658
They don't know what they're in for.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.451
Nope.

27:41.286 --> 27:42.704
What can I do for you, Trace?

27:43.413 --> 27:46.041
I got you something in LA.

27:50.879 --> 27:51.880
Is that...

27:52.798 --> 27:54.049
His mug.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.052
You stole Ed McMahon's mug?

27:57.636 --> 27:58.929
I sure did.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.597
Wow, that's...

28:01.557 --> 28:02.558
that's really...

28:07.688 --> 28:10.315
Mr. de Cordova--
that's Johnny's producer--

28:10.399 --> 28:14.278
he had a great idea about
maybe shooting a few segments

28:14.361 --> 28:15.779
while I'm up at Jamestown.

28:15.863 --> 28:18.448
Yeah. I need you to be
less concerned with Johnny

28:18.532 --> 28:20.742
and more focused on the program right now.

28:20.826 --> 28:22.619
It'd be great for the program, Ed.

28:22.703 --> 28:25.706
It'd give kids a close-up look at the moon

28:25.789 --> 28:27.875
and all the amazing things
we're doing up there.

28:27.958 --> 28:29.918
Yeah, that's all well and good, Trace,

28:30.002 --> 28:33.422
but you launch in less than a month,
and you just missed your third SIM, so...

28:33.505 --> 28:35.924
I know. I'm sorry, Ed.

28:37.509 --> 28:39.219
I just got the schedule mixed up.

28:39.303 --> 28:43.223
With all the celebrating
that Sam and I have been doing,

28:43.307 --> 28:44.933
I've just been a little distracted.

28:45.017 --> 28:46.977
Yeah. Saw that. That was...

28:48.937 --> 28:49.938
really something.

28:52.441 --> 28:54.693
Well, guess I'll head over to SIM.

28:55.485 --> 28:56.486
Yeah.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.284
-Is there a problem, Ed?
-Nope.

29:05.787 --> 29:06.788
Hey.

29:07.581 --> 29:09.583
You can't just be happy for me?

29:11.376 --> 29:12.878
-Happy for you?
-Yeah.

29:14.129 --> 29:16.548
You didn't have to announce it
on national TV, Trace.

29:16.632 --> 29:19.176
All right, so this is about Gordo,
'cause it always is.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.260
He deserved to know.

29:21.386 --> 29:25.307
I don't remember you being concerned
about what I deserved to know

29:25.390 --> 29:28.227
when Gordo was fucking
all those Cape cookies in Florida.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.811
Come on.

29:31.522 --> 29:33.398
Yeah, you're right. You're right, Ed.

29:33.482 --> 29:37.110
Yeah, tell all those new recruits
about them good old days.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.862
-Yeah.
-Thanks a lot.

29:54.002 --> 29:55.087
Take a seat.

30:00.634 --> 30:01.635
Welcome to NASA.

30:02.845 --> 30:06.223
You are, as of this moment,
officially astronaut candidates.

30:06.306 --> 30:10.435
Affectionately referred to
from this point on as "ASCANs."

30:11.979 --> 30:15.732
Now, this is
a rigorous 24-7 training program

30:15.816 --> 30:17.359
preparing you for space travel.

30:18.777 --> 30:22.614
I'll be grading you as we go,
and everything you do will be graded.

30:24.241 --> 30:28.620
Academics, pilot performance,
your character and motivation.

30:28.704 --> 30:32.249
I'll be posting results from time to time
in the hall outside.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.959
If your name's not on that list,

30:34.042 --> 30:35.878
-well, you're cut.
-...you're cut.

30:39.089 --> 30:40.090
Kill the lights.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.398
Shit.

30:56.481 --> 30:59.860
All that practice in your office
really been paying off.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.862
Yeah, it's my knee acting up.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.280
It's your knee?

31:04.489 --> 31:07.201
Try coming back from one-sixth gravity
to play 18 holes.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.460
Drive gets a lot less distance down here.

31:18.712 --> 31:19.922
That's a nice swing.

31:30.682 --> 31:31.683
Wow.

31:32.976 --> 31:34.269
Every time.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.980
That's a really nice shot, Wayne.

31:37.523 --> 31:38.524
Thanks, Ed.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.451
All this for little old me?

32:32.995 --> 32:33.996
Captain Stevens.

32:37.583 --> 32:38.667
Get out of here.

32:39.251 --> 32:40.586
Come here.

32:41.378 --> 32:43.422
So good to have you back, Danny.

32:46.884 --> 32:48.135
Jimmy.

32:48.719 --> 32:49.720
Jimmy.

32:50.637 --> 32:51.638
Jimmy!

32:51.722 --> 32:53.307
Come and say hi to your brother.

32:54.516 --> 32:57.728
You're lucky he made an appearance.
Usually doesn't leave his room.

32:59.605 --> 33:00.647
Hi, shit bird.

33:00.731 --> 33:02.065
Hey, bird shit.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.860
I got steaks going. You want a beer?

33:08.488 --> 33:09.489
Come here.

33:10.908 --> 33:12.576
-How you been?
-Good, you?

33:12.659 --> 33:16.038
Oh, my God. Has my baby boy
grown that much since Christmas?

33:17.956 --> 33:18.957
Damn.

33:20.292 --> 33:21.293
Danny.

33:25.339 --> 33:26.673
My boy.

33:26.757 --> 33:27.883
Stop being weird, Mom.

33:29.218 --> 33:33.347
I know, I'm just...
I'm just taking it in, is all.

33:37.142 --> 33:38.310
Hey, baby.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.731
Wow.

33:42.814 --> 33:46.360
-It's the size of your whole hand, that.
-Come on, give me a break.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.198
Trace.

33:52.658 --> 33:53.659
Gordo.

33:54.743 --> 33:55.744
Now,

33:56.370 --> 33:57.412
I wanna make a toast.

33:57.496 --> 33:59.748
-Dad, no, you really don't have to--
-No, no.

33:59.831 --> 34:00.999
Just let me do this.

34:02.876 --> 34:06.088
It's an accomplishment, sticking it out
that first year at Annapolis.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.465
Hell, you even made it look easy.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.467
So damn proud of you, Danny.

34:11.260 --> 34:13.094
-We all are.
-Thanks, Dad.

34:13.178 --> 34:14.763
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

34:14.847 --> 34:18.225
Hold on a second. There's
one more thing that I wanted to say.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.062
Trace.

34:27.150 --> 34:28.235
Congratulations.

34:29.652 --> 34:32.322
I'm happy for you.
Sam is a-- He's a good guy.

34:33.282 --> 34:34.283
Thanks, Gordo.

34:37.286 --> 34:38.286
Cheers.

34:39.663 --> 34:43.208
Probably could have done a lot better,
but there's no accounting for taste.

34:44.543 --> 34:45.752
There he is.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.545
There he is. All right.

34:56.346 --> 35:00.475
Ed Baldwin wearing reading glasses?
Will wonders never cease?

35:00.559 --> 35:02.019
It'll happen to you too, Mol.

35:02.603 --> 35:03.604
Never.

35:04.062 --> 35:07.357
Twenty-twenty till the day I die.
Just like my nana.

35:08.650 --> 35:11.987
So, how are you adjusting to life
back Earth-side?

35:12.529 --> 35:15.032
I don't know. It's funny.
Sometimes I feel like

35:15.782 --> 35:18.535
when I'm down here
is when I'm in outer space.

35:19.703 --> 35:24.541
When I'm up there,
everything is just... right, you know?

35:25.667 --> 35:27.085
Till that fucking storm hit.

35:27.169 --> 35:29.129
Yeah, it was a mean son of a bitch.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.257
Hey, I read the incident report.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.470
I've known you a pretty long time, Mol.

35:36.553 --> 35:38.096
Spit it out, Ed.

35:38.639 --> 35:41.683
There's no way you waited
in that lava tube for the storm to pass.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.310
Not while Wubbo was out there.

35:43.393 --> 35:46.939
So I just... wanna know that you're okay.

35:47.606 --> 35:48.607
I'm fine.

35:49.191 --> 35:52.027
Look, we say what we gotta
say to the docs. I get it.

35:52.110 --> 35:55.614
Lie to a NASA flight surgeon?
That would not be correct procedure, sir.

35:55.697 --> 35:59.076
No, I mean, Molly Cobb would never
go against procedure.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.494
-Never.
-Preposterous.

36:00.577 --> 36:01.578
No way.

36:04.289 --> 36:05.290
I'm fine, Ed.

36:07.626 --> 36:09.962
What about you?
Don't you miss it, being up there?

36:10.629 --> 36:13.757
Yeah, I miss it.
Not as much as I thought I would.

36:14.341 --> 36:15.717
<i>Pathfinder's</i> your baby.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.970
You're okay with someone else
taking her up?

36:18.804 --> 36:20.806
I've had all the time up there
that I need.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.852
When I first met the great Ed Baldwin,

36:24.935 --> 36:30.023
he was the last person in Houston I
ever thought would be fine flying a desk.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.901
Yeah, you and me both.

36:35.863 --> 36:36.989
I don't know.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.576
The life you think you're gonna have...

36:41.910 --> 36:44.121
just sometimes doesn't end up
making you happy.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.498
And I'm happy, you know,

36:46.582 --> 36:51.587
being there for Kelly and Karen
and, hell, even those ASCANs.

36:52.296 --> 36:53.422
It means something.

36:53.964 --> 36:55.340
I know it--

36:56.258 --> 36:58.218
it's not pushing the envelope, but

36:58.802 --> 37:01.597
sometimes it's just more important
to be with the people you love

37:01.680 --> 37:03.724
than doing what you love.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.059
You sound like a fortune cookie.

37:07.019 --> 37:08.187
Yeah.

37:09.271 --> 37:10.731
Is that what I think it is?

37:10.814 --> 37:13.066
Just ignore it. They'll only deny it.

37:14.735 --> 37:15.736
Play.

37:17.446 --> 37:18.739
Jeez.

37:18.822 --> 37:20.824
No, I didn't want a soffit built,

37:20.908 --> 37:24.661
and then the contractor says to me
with a straight face,

37:24.745 --> 37:26.288
"It's gonna be two more months."

37:26.371 --> 37:29.917
-Like, what? Two more months?
-Right.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.919
Come on, I just...

37:32.836 --> 37:35.047
-No, wait, you... killed it.
-Shit.

37:37.257 --> 37:42.513
Let's just say I spent a night
out on the quad naked and hog-tied.

37:45.891 --> 37:46.975
Of course you did.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.811
That sounds terrible.

37:49.895 --> 37:51.230
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

37:51.313 --> 37:54.233
If you don't know
your <i>Reef Points</i>, I mean verbatim,

37:54.316 --> 37:55.526
they get you.

37:55.609 --> 37:56.985
They do it to all the plebes.

38:14.503 --> 38:15.504
Okay.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.714
Shit.

38:17.798 --> 38:19.508
It's getting late, I gotta go.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.844
Come on, Trace. You don't have to.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.512
It's barely 9:00.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.597
I got an early SIM tomorrow,

38:25.681 --> 38:27.266
and I missed the last one, so...

38:27.975 --> 38:30.310
You don't wanna get on Ed's bad side.

38:30.394 --> 38:31.395
No, you don't.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.858
-This was really nice.
-Yeah, it was.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.819
Do you need help with the dishes?

38:38.902 --> 38:42.322
No, I got it.
I'm getting pretty good at it actually.

38:42.406 --> 38:43.407
Really?

38:44.575 --> 38:46.493
Let me see those dishpan hands.

38:47.911 --> 38:49.663
Sheila's coming over tomorrow, isn't she?

38:49.746 --> 38:51.456
First thing in the morning.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.586
-Good to see you, Trace.
-Good to see you too.

38:56.086 --> 38:59.298
All right, boys, have a good night.
It's good to have you home, baby.

38:59.381 --> 39:00.716
-Thanks again, Gordo.
-Night.

39:01.842 --> 39:03.177
Night, Mom.

39:08.265 --> 39:09.516
All right, boys.

39:10.475 --> 39:12.519
Got a fridge full of beer,
and Cheez Balls,

39:12.603 --> 39:14.104
and Sgt. Slaughter's on the tube.

39:15.230 --> 39:17.733
Dad, we were gonna go
hang out with some friends.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.276
First night back and all.

39:19.860 --> 39:20.861
Right.

39:20.944 --> 39:21.945
Of course.

39:22.863 --> 39:24.823
No, you go on and have a good night.

39:24.907 --> 39:27.201
-You're sure? We could just...
-No, no, really.

39:27.284 --> 39:28.577
You go on.

39:28.660 --> 39:31.955
Your old man's got a bunch of work
to catch up on anyway, so...

39:32.748 --> 39:33.749
All right.

39:33.832 --> 39:35.042
All right, don't wait up.

39:35.709 --> 39:36.710
Come on, Jimmy.

39:43.258 --> 39:44.384
Look after each other.

41:14.183 --> 41:15.434
Negative pressure.

41:21.064 --> 41:22.065
Yes!

41:31.867 --> 41:33.160
Thank you, brother.

41:35.078 --> 41:38.624
So, does everyone
have to get that haircut,

41:38.707 --> 41:41.627
or is that some kind cruel punishment
just for you?

41:43.462 --> 41:47.174
No, no, we all get it.
Except the girls, obviously.

41:47.257 --> 41:48.383
Any cute ones?

41:48.467 --> 41:49.718
Like you'd know what to do.

41:56.517 --> 41:58.477
Are they as hard on the plebes
as they say?

41:59.228 --> 42:00.646
It's not so bad.

42:00.729 --> 42:03.565
Once you get through the first month
it's easier.

42:04.274 --> 42:07.694
-That's not what you said to Mom and Dad.
-Shut up, shit bird.

42:07.778 --> 42:09.988
Did you really get to ride
on an aircraft carrier?

42:10.072 --> 42:11.114
Yeah.

42:11.698 --> 42:12.699
What was it like?

42:14.493 --> 42:16.745
You first stand out there, it's like--

42:17.329 --> 42:19.581
like you're standing
in the middle of the ocean,

42:19.665 --> 42:22.125
surrounded by nothing but water and sky.

42:23.043 --> 42:24.795
-That's pretty cool.
-Yeah.

42:25.379 --> 42:27.798
The best part is

42:27.881 --> 42:31.051
seeing a Tomcat come in for a landing
at 150 knots.

42:31.134 --> 42:35.055
You see this thing barreling towards you,
fast as hell,

42:35.138 --> 42:36.348
and you're sure

42:36.431 --> 42:39.643
that this thing's just gonna skid right
off the other side of the deck.

42:40.602 --> 42:42.271
But then, before you know it,

42:42.354 --> 42:47.234
all of a sudden that tailhook grabs on
to that cable, and it just stops. Cold.

42:48.110 --> 42:49.444
Right there in front of you.

42:51.321 --> 42:52.656
Never seen anything like it.

43:24.646 --> 43:25.647
Hello.

43:25.731 --> 43:28.233
<i>Hey, Ed. Could you come down here?</i>

43:28.984 --> 43:30.235
Why? What happened?

43:30.319 --> 43:31.403
<i>It's Gordo.</i>

43:33.488 --> 43:39.786
<i>The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing</i>

43:41.705 --> 43:44.499
<i>I am the eye in the sky</i>

43:44.583 --> 43:50.214
<i>Looking at you
I can read your mind</i>

43:50.297 --> 43:52.925
<i>I am the maker of rules</i>

43:56.470 --> 43:57.638
Oh, shit.

43:58.222 --> 44:00.140
Hey, can I get one more, please?

44:01.183 --> 44:02.851
And I'm gonna get one for my friend...

44:03.894 --> 44:05.854
Darlene. And...

44:10.484 --> 44:12.152
Hey, Eddie.

44:12.236 --> 44:13.529
I'll get one for Ed. Hey.

44:13.612 --> 44:14.613
Hey.

44:14.696 --> 44:16.156
-How you feeling?
-Good.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.200
Wanna go get some fresh air?

44:18.283 --> 44:19.535
Go for a little walk?

44:19.618 --> 44:22.663
-Just having a good time.
-I can tell you're having a good time.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.625
I need to talk to you though.

44:27.709 --> 44:30.170
Sorry, ladies,
I'm gonna have to steal him away from you.

44:30.254 --> 44:31.672
My buddy. Ed.

44:34.424 --> 44:36.510
Yeah, you--

44:36.593 --> 44:38.762
-Yeah, you've got those moves.
-Dance moves.

44:38.846 --> 44:39.888
All right.

44:42.015 --> 44:46.812
Look, I get the whole thing with
Tracy getting married is rough, but

44:46.895 --> 44:48.105
you know what?

44:49.106 --> 44:50.107
Fuck her.

44:51.316 --> 44:54.111
You've been divorced five goddamn years.

44:54.736 --> 44:56.196
You gotta move on.

44:57.197 --> 44:58.198
She has.

44:58.282 --> 44:59.783
Yeah.

44:59.867 --> 45:02.536
You got a good job,
your boys are growing up strong,

45:02.619 --> 45:04.371
you almost got all your hair left.

45:06.123 --> 45:08.750
And all that stuff that happened
in the past, you just--

45:11.086 --> 45:12.129
Look.

45:12.671 --> 45:13.964
Just leave it there.

45:17.426 --> 45:18.552
I can't. I...

45:21.847 --> 45:22.848
I'm stuck.

45:24.099 --> 45:26.059
You know? It won't let me go.

45:29.313 --> 45:33.859
What are you talking about? Since when?
Where is all this coming from?

45:33.942 --> 45:35.694
I left something up there, Ed.

45:37.905 --> 45:39.907
Ever since we've been back, I just...

45:42.743 --> 45:44.661
it's like I don't even exist anymore.

45:45.787 --> 45:47.289
Like I'm a shadow, or...

45:49.333 --> 45:50.459
a ghost maybe.

45:50.542 --> 45:51.835
I don't know. I just--

45:54.129 --> 45:55.130
-I just--
-Gordo.

45:55.214 --> 45:56.215
I can't...

45:56.298 --> 45:58.175
Gordo. Get your ass back over here.

45:59.551 --> 46:00.636
Get off the damn road.

46:05.807 --> 46:07.267
What's going on with you, man?

46:12.356 --> 46:14.691
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing anymore, Ed.

46:17.528 --> 46:21.990
We were gonna lift people's eyes
up to the sky? Remember?

46:24.493 --> 46:25.869
Now I'm just nothing.

46:27.246 --> 46:31.458
I know that you had it
harder than me, you know, with Shane.

46:31.959 --> 46:35.921
You found a way
to make peace with it. In yourself.

46:38.006 --> 46:39.258
In your family.

46:43.303 --> 46:46.098
Shit, I don't want my boys
to see me like this.

47:07.202 --> 47:08.203
Gordo.

47:11.456 --> 47:13.250
Your boys worship you, man.

47:16.753 --> 47:20.465
You should have seen him, Ed.
In his summer whites.

47:20.549 --> 47:22.301
Midshipman Stevens.

47:24.511 --> 47:26.180
You remember your first year?

47:26.263 --> 47:29.016
Yeah, as much as I try to forget.

47:29.099 --> 47:33.020
Those were the best days of my life,
back at Northwestern.

47:33.645 --> 47:36.315
And I was out on my own
for the first time,

47:36.398 --> 47:39.109
and everything seemed possible.

47:39.651 --> 47:40.903
It was like...

47:42.029 --> 47:44.031
it was all just there for the taking.

47:44.114 --> 47:45.115
You know?

47:45.657 --> 47:46.658
Now here I am.

47:48.410 --> 47:49.995
Gordo Stevens.

47:50.829 --> 47:52.122
American hero.

47:57.336 --> 47:58.587
What a crock of shit.

48:01.965 --> 48:03.425
It's all just shit.

48:06.845 --> 48:08.013
It's shit.

48:09.723 --> 48:10.933
It's--

48:21.401 --> 48:22.569
Come on.

48:23.487 --> 48:26.073
Hey. Come on, bud. Get up, get up.

48:39.378 --> 48:40.462
All right.

48:48.178 --> 48:49.805
Better...

48:49.888 --> 48:51.473
Better get some shut-eye.

48:55.477 --> 48:56.478
Night, Ed.

49:55.996 --> 49:59.291
-Take care of yourself.
-Gonna miss you around here.

50:04.379 --> 50:05.380
Molly.

50:06.924 --> 50:08.300
Hey, Wubbo.

50:09.384 --> 50:10.719
Glad I saw you.

50:11.845 --> 50:14.431
I'm heading back home
to the Netherlands, so

50:15.015 --> 50:16.600
I guess this is goodbye.

50:16.683 --> 50:19.895
Shit. Flight surgeons
pulled your ticket, huh?

50:19.978 --> 50:22.189
That's not right, Wubbo.
They don't get to do that.

50:22.272 --> 50:25.692
No. This was my choice.
I'm leaving the program.

50:26.610 --> 50:28.028
You're leaving the program?

50:28.695 --> 50:29.696
Fuck that.

50:30.948 --> 50:32.908
I need to do what's best
for me and my family.

50:32.991 --> 50:35.244
No, you're taking the easy way out,
that's what you're doing.

50:35.327 --> 50:37.913
No, Molly. If I only have
a couple of more years left,

50:37.996 --> 50:40.290
-I want to spend them down here.
-That's bullshit. You don't know that.

50:40.374 --> 50:41.375
-Nobody does.
-Molly.

50:41.458 --> 50:43.669
You don't give up, Wubbo.
You keep fighting.

50:45.754 --> 50:47.464
I'm sorry you feel this way, Molly.

50:49.925 --> 50:51.134
Thank you.

51:16.910 --> 51:18.120
Yeah?

51:18.203 --> 51:20.581
<i>Mr. Stevens, this is Jane Markus at JSC.</i>

51:20.664 --> 51:23.250
<i>The weekly staff meeting
has been moved up to today.</i>

51:23.333 --> 51:25.460
<i>1100 at the astronaut meeting room.</i>

51:28.839 --> 51:30.090
I'm sorry, what?

51:30.174 --> 51:31.884
<i>1100. Thank you.</i>

52:24.186 --> 52:25.687
You look like hell.

52:26.188 --> 52:27.856
I feel like a million bucks.

52:28.565 --> 52:30.442
You know why they moved up the meeting?

52:30.859 --> 52:31.860
No.

52:31.944 --> 52:33.362
Good morning, everyone.

52:34.780 --> 52:35.864
Let's get to it.

52:39.243 --> 52:43.622
Jamestown 81 crew debrief
will be held at 0830 in room 6600.

52:43.705 --> 52:45.874
Attendance is mandatory
for all you rookies.

52:45.958 --> 52:49.545
Also, we had a T-38 close call
last week at El Paso.

52:49.628 --> 52:53.006
Even with our new inlets,
be sure to check takeoff data carefully,

52:53.090 --> 52:54.967
especially while carrying a pod.

52:56.635 --> 53:00.347
And I have a flight assignment
to announce.

53:01.598 --> 53:05.185
Danielle Poole will be joining
the crew of STS-83 Romeo!

53:07.187 --> 53:08.272
Congratulations.

53:08.897 --> 53:10.691
She's headed back to Jamestown.

53:12.234 --> 53:13.819
So happy for you, Dani.

53:14.486 --> 53:15.654
Thank you, babe.

53:16.697 --> 53:18.156
One more thing.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.284
Captain Gordo Stevens will be joining her.

53:33.672 --> 53:35.757
Shit, man. Gordo's back.

53:35.841 --> 53:37.676
-You must be flipping out.
-Yeah.

53:38.760 --> 53:39.928
-Yeah.
-Dani.

53:44.099 --> 53:45.517
Great to have you back.

53:47.728 --> 53:48.896
Congratulations, Captain.

53:48.979 --> 53:50.439
I'm not going back up, Ed.

53:51.064 --> 53:52.649
I can't. You know I can't.

53:53.442 --> 53:56.862
Well... that's not up to you.

53:56.945 --> 53:59.990
I decide who goes up and when, remember?

54:01.450 --> 54:02.451
You got this.

54:04.661 --> 54:06.205
Son of a bitch.

54:07.497 --> 54:10.501
Let's give the crew of Jamestown 91
another hand.

54:37.069 --> 54:39.112
Mind if I bum one of those?

54:53.669 --> 54:54.753
Thanks.
