00:24.991 --> 00:26.392
- DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Moving vans
and boxes.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.793
Packing and unpacking.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.996
That's pretty much been my life
for as long as I can remember.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.265
My name is Davis Pell.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.301
Because of my mom's job,
we've had to move around a lot.

00:36.403 --> 00:39.104
I only just moved to America
from Australia.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.339
When you're always
the new kid,

00:40.440 --> 00:42.074
it's pretty hard
to make friends.

00:42.175 --> 00:46.211
Most of the time,
it's just me hanging by myself.

00:46.312 --> 00:48.380
Never having a chance to settle
down can be a bit lonely,

00:48.481 --> 00:51.617
but I've found ways
to keep things--

00:51.718 --> 00:52.451
- MAN: Uh-aw!

00:52.552 --> 00:53.585
- DAVIS: --interesting.

00:53.686 --> 00:54.953
Couldn't be.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.321
- MAN: Oh-ah!

00:59.659 --> 01:02.561
- ♪

01:19.646 --> 01:20.746
- Ah!

01:20.847 --> 01:24.116
- Oooh!

01:24.217 --> 01:26.518
- Rayzon, you followed me
to America?

01:26.619 --> 01:28.320
- I would go anywhere
to finally destroy you,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.456
Davis Pell.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.124
Even suburban Seattle.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.927
- Let's end this.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.347
- DAVIS'S THOUGHTS:
It's possible

01:55.448 --> 01:59.051
I'm not the coolest guy
in the world.

01:59.152 --> 02:03.422
In fact, most people would say
I'm kind of a dork.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.656
And you know what?

02:04.757 --> 02:05.524
Uh!

02:05.625 --> 02:07.126
They might have a point.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.994
I mean, look at this.

02:09.095 --> 02:12.397
I'm having an imaginary fight,
and I'm losing.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.068
But not anymore.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.369
I'm at a new school.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.371
Heck, I'm in a new country.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.175
Things this year
will be different.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.610
I'm going to have friendS.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.111
I'm gonna be popular.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.914
Maybe I'll even get
a girlfriend for once.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.182
Whatever it takes.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.284
Starting this year,

02:32.385 --> 02:36.755
Davis Pell isn't
going to be a loser anymore.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.892
Uh!

02:44.063 --> 02:45.564
- I think you got 'em.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.704
- You didn't see
all of that, did you?

02:52.805 --> 02:54.406
- I think I can safely say

02:54.507 --> 02:59.811
I didn't see much as you
and Rayzon did.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.581
Rayzon.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.415
- Yeah.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.552
- Yeah.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.454
So...you live next door?

03:09.556 --> 03:12.558
- No, just a big fan
of porch swings.

03:12.659 --> 03:17.296
Travelling the country
porch swing to porch swing.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.498
- I hope
that works out for you.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.700
- Wait!

03:21.801 --> 03:25.003
Don't move!

03:25.104 --> 03:26.538
Shhhw.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.680
There was one behind you.

03:34.781 --> 03:35.914
- Thanks, Katniss.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.482
- No charge.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.528
- Hey, I was wondering.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.130
Maybe because I'm new in town
and all that,

03:52.232 --> 03:53.365
that maybe you could--

03:53.466 --> 03:57.436
- Uh, uh, uh, turn it around,
ninja warrior.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.472
I don't date boys
who play make-believe.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.744
- Right, got it.

04:15.888 --> 04:19.423
You're probably wondering
about the kaleidoscopes.

04:19.524 --> 04:20.959
My mom gets me one
every time we move.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.564
Told you we moved a lot.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.433
I've been collecting them
since I was a kid.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.535
I don't know
what it is about them.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.404
I guess I just like having
something to show

04:32.505 --> 04:34.273
for all the places
that I've lived.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.478
You also might have noticed
that sometimes

04:39.579 --> 04:42.114
I like to imagine stuff the way
I'd want it to be

04:42.215 --> 04:43.849
instead of how it really is.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.818
You know, like daydreaming.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.387
Let's just say that my daydreams

16:36.028 --> 16:38.429
- Tell me what you are.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.365
- What do you mean?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.166
- You're awkward.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.836
You really don't say anything
interesting.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.873
- Oh, you should be
a motivational speaker.

16:48.974 --> 16:52.477
- But I find myself
drawn to you.

16:54.713 --> 16:55.813
- What was that?

16:55.914 --> 16:57.148
- You don't have a reflection
in the mirror.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.282
You can't eat normal food.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.618
And you sparkle
in direct sunlight.

17:00.719 --> 17:02.253
- I sparkle?

17:07.092 --> 17:08.693
I'm sparkling.

17:08.794 --> 17:09.594
- Say it.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.494
- Say what?

17:10.596 --> 17:11.762
- I know what you are.

17:11.864 --> 17:12.630
- You do?

17:12.731 --> 17:13.765
- Yes, I do.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.067
Say it out loud.

17:16.167 --> 17:20.271
- Uh, I--I--I'm pale.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.240
No reflection.

17:22.340 --> 17:27.211
Uh, sparkling...like a vampire.

17:27.311 --> 17:27.811
- Uh!

17:27.913 --> 17:29.447
It's true?

17:35.287 --> 17:35.787
- Sure.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.322
Please promise to meet me
by the first tree

17:38.424 --> 17:40.625
at the school entrance
at 8:30 tomorrow.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.526
- Okay.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.301
Oh, boy.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.702
I'm dead.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.261
You look so cool.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.864
- Thanks.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.199
- Let's go in.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.434
- We just walk in
like in front of everyone?

18:23.535 --> 18:24.569
- Mm-hmm.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.170
Come on.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.016
- CAITLYN: Oh, hi, Bon.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.985
- BON: No way.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.635
- Is it true?

18:57.736 --> 18:59.270
- Is it true?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.544
What do you think?

19:11.350 --> 19:13.885
- This is totally
the most amazing thing

19:13.986 --> 19:16.154
to ever happen at this cool.

19:16.255 --> 19:21.425
It's true, Davis Pell
is a really, actually...

19:21.527 --> 19:23.161
a vampire.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.337
- Psst.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.843
Does this happen to you a lot?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.111
Do you go to new schools
and people think

19:40.212 --> 19:43.014
you're a supernatural creature?

19:43.115 --> 19:47.285
Oh, were you Rocky Raccoon
at your last school?

19:47.386 --> 19:51.289
- What makes you think
I'm not really a vampire?

19:51.390 --> 19:54.292
- You act like you're 14,
not 400.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.461
You go out during the day,
which pretty much goes against

19:57.563 --> 19:59.864
the most basic tenant
of vampire lure.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.201
And you are in no way suave.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.703
Oh, yeah,
and vampires aren't real.

20:19.084 --> 20:23.387
Don't worry,
I'm not going to say anything.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.589
- Why not?

20:24.690 --> 20:27.658
- Because you're making
everybody look like idiots.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.127
I kind of love that.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.396
But some advice.

20:32.497 --> 20:33.898
You're going
to have to step up your game

Thanks for helping me out

21:51.643 --> 21:52.710
You know, I've been up all night
trying to figure

21:53.945 --> 21:56.180
- Well, I decided if you're
going to make a mockery

- Now, I'm going
to get you looking the part,

22:04.890 --> 22:07.258
but you've got to get yourself
sounding the part.

22:07.359 --> 22:10.528
Talk to me
like you're really a vampire.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.663
- Okay.

22:12.764 --> 22:16.567
I'm totally a vampire.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.070
- What was that?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.472
- It was a vampire.

22:21.573 --> 22:24.141
- For someone
who already has an accent,

22:24.242 --> 22:26.410
you're terrible at accents.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.347
- Okay, well, first off,
I'm not the one with an accent.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.848
You are.
- Oh.

22:30.949 --> 22:34.151
- And secondly,
just tell me how I should sound.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.753
- Okay.

22:35.854 --> 22:39.256
The modern vampire
is more of a cross between

22:39.358 --> 22:41.926
a constipated model
and a freshman poetry major.

22:42.027 --> 22:42.893
- What?

22:42.994 --> 22:45.096
- Okay, repeat after me.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.864
You wouldn't understand.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.402
- You wouldn't understand.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.304
- More like you don't want
to deal with anything.

22:53.405 --> 22:54.405
- Should it really be
this much work

22:54.506 --> 22:55.973
to seem like I don't care?

22:56.074 --> 22:57.942
- For you, yes.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.117
- Thanks for helping me
pick out all these clothes.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.219
- No charge, Edward Cullen.

23:09.421 --> 23:11.188
Okay, how's
the vampire voice coming?

23:11.289 --> 23:11.922
- Oh.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.859
You wouldn't understand.

23:15.827 --> 23:16.761
Not bad.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.629
- Yeah?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.231
So what else is there to know
about vampires?

23:20.332 --> 23:21.599
Like I know
all the regular stuff

23:21.700 --> 23:25.236
like wooden stakes and sunlight
and all that stuff.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.438
But what else?

23:27.539 --> 23:29.507
- There's a couple things.

23:29.608 --> 23:33.544
For instance, vampires
are terrified of rabbits.

23:33.645 --> 23:36.347
They're incapable
of singing "Happy Birthday."

23:36.448 --> 23:38.582
Oh, and this is
an important one.

23:38.683 --> 23:41.419
If you beat a vampire
in a staring contest,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.654
it renders them powerless.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.756
- A staring contest?
- Mm-hmm.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.224
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

23:47.325 --> 23:48.492
- I don't believe you.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.761
- Fine, you don't
have to believe me.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.496
Here's proof.

24:06.745 --> 24:07.645
- Doh!

24:07.746 --> 24:08.245
Okay!

24:09.381 --> 24:10.748
- Okay, you win.

24:10.849 --> 24:13.184
But seriously, we really
need to figure a way

24:13.285 --> 24:15.052
we can sell this at school.

24:15.153 --> 24:16.987

24:17.088 --> 24:19.190
I have a few ideas.

a number of signs indicating
just such an occurrence,

I will stalk the monster

28:16.761 --> 28:18.495
What's your story?

28:18.596 --> 28:21.031
- My story?

28:27.138 --> 28:30.574
I was born in a graveyard
at midnight.

28:30.675 --> 28:31.975
- Whoa.

28:32.077 --> 28:35.546
- And still an infant,
I was abandoned.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.982
I found myself nursing
from a mother emu.

28:39.084 --> 28:42.786
She took me in, and her family
raised me as her own.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.355
They taught me how to hunt.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.957
And how to kill.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.094
- What does any of this
have to do with vampires?

28:50.195 --> 28:53.530
- My skills are vast,
I assure you.

28:53.631 --> 28:56.834
I have the yellow belt in nine
different forms of "ka-ra-tay,"

28:56.935 --> 29:00.537
which technically makes me
a third degree black belt.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.072
And I've defeated
the game Castlevania,

29:03.241 --> 29:07.544
And I have seen the movie
"Van Helsing" 47 times!

29:07.645 --> 29:09.246
And I hated that movie.

29:09.347 --> 29:10.848
- That--that's all great,

29:10.949 --> 29:12.649
but how is it going to help you
get this guy?

29:15.086 --> 29:16.754
Mark my words.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.423
I will hunt this creature down
to the ends of the world.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.825
There is nowhere he can hide.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.362
- Finding him
won't be a problem.

29:25.463 --> 29:26.930

29:34.839 --> 29:36.840
- Which one is he?

29:36.941 --> 29:40.244
- He's right there.

29:40.345 --> 29:42.446
- Excellent.

29:42.547 --> 29:44.014
- So, what's your plan?

29:44.115 --> 29:46.316
- This container
is filled with water

29:46.417 --> 29:49.787
caught from the base
of the Carpathian Mountains.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.890
It is renowned for
its vampire-killing properties.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.593

it's going to be poof...

30:16.314 --> 30:17.014
- Yeah.

I am the water delivery person.

30:19.984 --> 30:23.420
And I'm here
to deliver the water.

30:23.521 --> 30:24.555
- TEACHER: No water here.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.558
You probably want
the teacher's lounge.

30:27.659 --> 30:32.963
- Or perhaps--or perhaps
it was right here!

30:34.065 --> 30:37.467
- Ah!

terror.

31:02.327 --> 31:03.126
Yeah.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.400
- Mm.

31:10.501 --> 31:11.768
I guess we're gonna need a mop.

31:14.505 --> 31:16.707
- Hey, Vi.

31:16.808 --> 31:20.177
- So, this is what
your lair looks like.

31:20.278 --> 31:23.447
I expected more candelabras
and flowy curtains.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.249
- Ha, ha, very funny.

31:27.285 --> 31:31.655
- So...how do I look?

31:31.756 --> 31:35.225
- Not to feed your already
rapidly growing ego,

31:35.326 --> 31:38.629
but you do look relatively
presentable tonight.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.364
- You're so sweet.

31:40.465 --> 31:41.231
- Mmm.

31:44.202 --> 31:48.605
So...what's with
all the telescopes?

31:48.706 --> 31:52.442
- They're kaleidoscopes.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.378
- Why do you have all of them?

31:54.479 --> 31:57.881
- Oh, well, my mom gets me one
every time we move.

31:57.982 --> 32:00.450
- Wow, you do move a lot.

32:01.953 --> 32:06.723
Yeah, I know it's weird, but it
makes my mom happy, so...

32:06.824 --> 32:12.396

I--I kind of like them, too.

the only things I really have

32:17.101 --> 32:18.902
from all the places
that I've lived.

32:26.244 --> 32:28.679

they're weird at all.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.080
I like them.

32:30.181 --> 32:33.317
They're cool.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.918

40:38.269 --> 40:39.836
Oh, come on, she can't
actually believe that.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.672
- Uh, you're talking about
the girl that already believes

40:42.773 --> 40:44.607
you're a real-life vampire.

40:44.708 --> 40:47.644
She's expecting you
to bite her on the neck

40:47.745 --> 40:49.746

41:02.993 --> 41:04.594
- Oh, I see now.

41:04.695 --> 41:05.895

of Caitlyn?

41:08.732 --> 41:09.732

41:09.834 --> 41:12.335
I think you're jealous of me
for being popular.

41:12.436 --> 41:16.105
Why would you be jealous
of Caitlyn?

41:16.207 --> 41:18.208

No reason at all.

Okay, here we go.

know what I'm worrying about.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.863
I mean, she likes me, right?

41:39.964 --> 41:41.431
I can just confess,

41:41.532 --> 41:43.466
and we can put
all of this behind us.

41:48.739 --> 41:50.340
Hey, Caitlyn.

41:50.441 --> 41:53.643
I've got something
to confess to you.

41:53.744 --> 41:57.313

I like you for you.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.120
Now kiss me.

42:11.128 --> 42:13.429
- DAVIS'S THOUGHTS: Come on,
Davis, hold it together.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.165
Just tell her the truth,
and everything will be fine.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.001
Besides, she can't really think

42:18.102 --> 42:19.636
I'm going to turn her
into a vampire.

42:24.608 --> 42:26.109
Uh-oh.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.922
It looks like
you've got a nice place here.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.757

42:44.428 --> 42:46.563
I've been meaning to tell you.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.721
- Bite me.

43:11.822 --> 43:14.357

43:14.458 --> 43:16.192
there's something
that I really need to tell you.

43:16.293 --> 43:18.895
- Ssh, don't spoil the moment
with your talking.

43:18.996 --> 43:20.363
Just do it.

43:23.033 --> 43:24.500
- Okay.

43:31.875 --> 43:36.746
Ugh, Caitlyn, there's
a whole bunch of people here.

43:38.749 --> 43:39.882
- Mm-hmm.

43:39.984 --> 43:41.551
Better not disappoint.

43:49.994 --> 43:51.961
- I have to pee.

44:19.423 --> 44:20.256
- Ready?

44:21.458 --> 44:22.659
- Mm-mm.

44:35.372 --> 44:38.141
- How does it feel?

44:38.242 --> 44:40.943
- It doesn't really
feel like anything.

44:41.045 --> 44:43.079
- Uh, that's how
it's supposed to feel.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.380
That means it's working.

44:44.481 --> 44:47.216
That means it's working!

44:47.317 --> 44:50.053

even bite her.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.021

it just didn't take.

44:54.658 --> 44:55.692

45:24.221 --> 45:27.123
Can't you take a joke?

45:29.293 --> 45:32.061

wasn't a vampire after all.

Come on.

you're all right?

46:15.405 --> 46:18.841

46:21.044 --> 46:24.147
I know it's tough on you
sometimes

46:24.248 --> 46:29.418
with all the moving
and the changes.

46:29.520 --> 46:33.156
I am sorry you have
to go through that all the time.

46:33.257 --> 46:34.624
- Okay.

46:34.725 --> 46:35.958
Thanks.

46:52.843 --> 46:53.743
- Do you know why

46:53.844 --> 46:57.747
I get you a kaleidoscope
every time we move?

46:57.848 --> 46:59.849
- Why, mom?

46:59.950 --> 47:03.986
- Because you look in it,
and it's beautiful.

47:06.757 --> 47:11.861
But the slightest
turn of the wheel...

47:11.962 --> 47:17.099
can change everything.

47:17.201 --> 47:20.102
Thing is, that change

47:20.204 --> 47:23.206
can be beautiful, too.

47:23.307 --> 47:24.841

going to untie me now?

- Well, maybe.

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:16.585
But I'm thinking you're probably
blaming me for all of this,

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.320
and that you might
actually hit me.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:19.688
- That's true.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.926

that you saved me

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.995
and give you that kiss
you've been looking for.

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.568

- So, we're like a couple now,
huh?

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:26.454
- Yeah, don't get used to it.

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.989
You're not even my type.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.025
- How's that?

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:32.060

into werewolves.
