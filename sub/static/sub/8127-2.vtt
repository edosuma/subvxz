    you kill my ambition.

            something.          

06:35.495 --> 06:36.494
        Would you promise me?   

06:36.496 --> 06:37.828

06:37.830 --> 06:39.964
         Promise me you won't   
         leave me over $500,000.

06:39.966 --> 06:40.999
        I couldn't handle it.   

06:41.001 --> 06:42.266

                  could Michael.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.267

Come on. It's coming            
right now, if you sit down.

    That ain't no surprise.     
    That's a chicken.           

07:13.299 --> 07:15.266
     It's chicken surprise.     

07:15.268 --> 07:17.301
I fixed it with pineapple rings 

07:17.303 --> 07:20.238
        and brown sugar         
      and sliced almonds.

      It's Hawaiian style.      

07:22.142 --> 07:24.708
          I don't care          
 if you put a hula skirt on it. 

07:24.710 --> 07:26.777
  It's nothing but a chicken.

      We had it four times      
    already this week.          

07:35.388 --> 07:37.422
  Look, it's having an effect   
  on the Meathead over there.   

07:37.424 --> 07:38.689
          He's looking          
      like a chicken-head.      

07:44.796 --> 07:49.267
But chicken... chicken          
is only 29 cents a pound,       

07:49.269 --> 07:51.302

      they could fine him       
      or put him in jail.       

11:20.179 --> 11:22.079
        Jail? Oh, my...         

11:22.081 --> 11:23.681
Lay off of the jail stuff,      
        will you?               

11:23.683 --> 11:25.516
    I didn't commit nothing.    

11:25.518 --> 11:29.019
I just didn't mention something,
          that's all.           

11:29.021 --> 11:30.888
        I was just, uh,         
     what do you call it...     

11:30.890 --> 11:34.325
    exercising my loophole,     
like any of the big guys.       

11:37.061 --> 11:39.730
        Face it, Daddy.         
What you did was illegal.       

11:39.732 --> 11:41.932
I don't want you                
going to jail, Archie.          

11:41.934 --> 11:45.135
          [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]  
          I ain't going to jail.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.572
You never could get used        
to a strange bathroom.          

11:48.574 --> 11:49.507
                         Oh!    

11:53.645 --> 11:55.913
      Just stifle yourself, huh?

11:55.915 --> 11:57.247
         Look, Archie,          
      you'd better go down      

11:57.249 --> 11:58.349
      to that tax office.       

11:58.351 --> 12:00.150
      If you wait for them      
    to come after you,          

12:00.152 --> 12:01.552
        they could              
     throw the book at you.     

12:01.554 --> 12:02.886
What do you know about it?      

12:02.888 --> 12:04.888
      You ain't gonna see       
the inside of a tax office      

12:04.890 --> 12:06.256
      as long as you live.      

12:06.258 --> 12:08.959
    Don't be telling me when    
 I got to go to the tax office. 

12:10.595 --> 12:11.462
            Edith...            

12:13.665 --> 12:16.734
              I'm going         
              to the tax office.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.268
            So first thing      
            tomorrow morning,   

12:18.270 --> 12:19.503
         you get yourself ready.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.504
      Now, you're going with me.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.105
Why does Ma have to go with you?

12:22.107 --> 12:24.274
          Because she and me    
          signed a joint return,

12:24.276 --> 12:25.275
                that's why...   

12:25.277 --> 12:26.644
                  with our names
                  on it there,  

12:26.646 --> 12:28.946
         and she's in this thing
         up to her neck.        

12:28.948 --> 12:29.913
Archie...                       

12:31.316 --> 12:33.016
I don't know anything...        

12:33.018 --> 12:36.186
Up... to your neck, Edith.      

12:44.830 --> 12:45.830
              Look at this here.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.030
                Will you look   
                at the time?    

12:47.032 --> 12:48.833
        It's 10 minutes to 1:00.
        There you are:          

12:48.835 --> 12:50.468
              a whole half      
              a day's pay, shot.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.669
    It shows you what you get   

12:51.671 --> 12:53.070
                for trying to be
                a good citizen. 

12:53.072 --> 12:55.773
It'll be all right, Archie.     
Don't be nervous.               

12:55.775 --> 12:57.007
         I ain't nervous, Edith.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.743
What are you                    
picking your ear for?           

12:59.745 --> 13:01.311
                Just passing    
                the time, Edith.

13:01.313 --> 13:04.314
         It's an old army trick.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.649
RECEPTIONIST:                   
Mr. Baxter.                     
                          Huh?  

13:05.651 --> 13:08.151
Baxter.                         

13:08.153 --> 13:09.353
      Yes, Ma'am.               

13:09.355 --> 13:11.121
            You are nervous.    

13:11.123 --> 13:12.322
Don't worry.                    

13:12.324 --> 13:14.625
All you have to do              
is go in                        

13:14.627 --> 13:17.094
and tell them you're sorry,     
and you won't do it again.      

13:19.230 --> 13:21.231
         How many times have I  
         got to tell you, Edith?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.033
            I didn't do nothing.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.636
Well, you didn't                
declare your income.            

13:25.638 --> 13:27.805
          Edith, I'm telling you
          for the last time,    

13:27.807 --> 13:29.840
             that wasn't income.

13:29.842 --> 13:33.477
         That was money I earned
         by working on Sundays. 

13:37.048 --> 13:38.916
                 What a man does
                 on the Sabbath 

13:38.918 --> 13:41.318
                  is between him
                  and his maker.

13:44.756 --> 13:46.423
Oh, I don't think               
the government                  

13:46.425 --> 13:49.459
is as religious as you are.     

13:53.464 --> 13:55.032
    Have a little mercy on me   

13:55.034 --> 13:57.434
            and stifle yourself,
            will you?           

13:57.436 --> 13:59.537
            Just sit there quiet
            and try and remember

13:59.539 --> 14:00.704
        what you're going to say

14:00.706 --> 14:03.407
         when you get into      
         the tax examiner there.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.776
Well, there's nothing           
to remember.                    

14:05.778 --> 14:07.377
All I'm going to do             
is agree                        

14:07.379 --> 14:09.413
with everything                 
you tell him.                   

14:09.415 --> 14:11.248
        That's right. Good girl.

14:12.751 --> 14:15.719
What are you                    
gonna tell him?                 

14:15.721 --> 14:17.955
              I'm gonna tell him
              the truth, Edith--

14:17.957 --> 14:19.890
          that I had all        
          the figures wrote down

14:19.892 --> 14:21.892
             on a piece of paper
             that I gave to you 

14:21.894 --> 14:24.261
              and you threw them
              away by mistake.  

14:24.263 --> 14:25.963
I-- I don't remember            

14:25.965 --> 14:28.933
throwing a piece of paper       
away by mistake.                

14:28.935 --> 14:31.201
             How could you      
             remember it, Edith,

14:31.203 --> 14:34.004
            if it was a mistake?

14:34.006 --> 14:37.641
Oh, yeah.                       
That makes sense.               

14:39.143 --> 14:40.945
It's hot in here.               

14:40.947 --> 14:43.246
        Well, take              
        your coat off, Edith.   

14:43.248 --> 14:44.548
Oh, yeah.                       

14:47.919 --> 14:50.888
         How come you're wearing
         a fancy dress today?   

14:50.890 --> 14:53.691
Well, you want me               
to look nice, don't you?        

14:53.693 --> 14:57.595
                  Not down here,
                  Edith, jeez.  

14:57.597 --> 14:59.597
      That tax examiner sees you
      all dolled up that way,   

14:59.599 --> 15:00.831
             he'll think I'm one

15:00.833 --> 15:03.567
    of them Park Avenue dudes   
    with money to burn.         

15:03.569 --> 15:04.534
Mr. Johnson.                    

15:07.338 --> 15:08.739
        Oh, look, another guy   
        going in there          

15:08.741 --> 15:09.873
                    ahead of me.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.875
        I ain't never going     
        to get into that office.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.077
Maybe you'd better              
call the plant                  

15:13.079 --> 15:15.813
and tell them you might         
not be in at all today.         

15:15.815 --> 15:17.014
                Yeah, all right,
                I'll do that.   

15:17.016 --> 15:18.348
            I'll call the plant.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.851
      You just stay here, Edith,
      and mind my chair, huh?   

15:20.853 --> 15:22.686
        And, uh, Edith, uh...   

15:25.189 --> 15:26.657
                 Watch your bag.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.259
Oh, Edith...                    

15:29.261 --> 15:30.694
                      Excuse me.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.130
Gee, buddy, why don't you       
watch where you're going?       

15:33.132 --> 15:34.531
You nearly stepped              
on my foot here.                

15:34.533 --> 15:36.000
 Well, I didn't see your foot.  

15:36.002 --> 15:37.868
     Well, you see a person     
         standing here,         

15:37.870 --> 15:40.004
you know there's got to be      
    a foot down there.          

15:41.305 --> 15:42.439
MAN: Hey, Phil.                 
                         What?  

15:42.441 --> 15:44.108
Your McGovern button.           
                        Huh?    

15:44.110 --> 15:46.243
         Turn it over,          
     like my Nixon button.      

15:46.245 --> 15:47.511
No politics in the office.      

15:47.513 --> 15:49.346
    Yeah. Oh, okay. Thanks.     

15:49.348 --> 15:51.782
    You nearly stepped          
        on my foot here.        

15:51.784 --> 15:53.483
            Said I was sorry.   

15:53.485 --> 15:54.618
Will you stop worrying?         

15:54.620 --> 15:56.086
I'm telling you,                
it's in the bag.                

15:56.088 --> 15:57.087
It's all sewed up.              

15:57.089 --> 16:00.024
I got the guy                   
in my hip pocket.               

16:00.026 --> 16:01.025
Listen to me.                   

16:01.027 --> 16:02.993
These examiners                 
are only human, right?          

16:02.995 --> 16:05.062
I mean, what can a guy          
like that pull down?            

16:05.064 --> 16:06.563
A hundred and a half,           
200 tops.                       

16:06.565 --> 16:07.865
All right,                      
so the minute                   

16:07.867 --> 16:09.967
he starts digging               
into our return,                

16:09.969 --> 16:12.402
I figure                        
I'll schmear him.               

16:12.404 --> 16:13.570
All I said was,                 

16:13.572 --> 16:16.073
"Hey, you ever been             
to the Virgin Islands?"         

16:16.075 --> 16:17.808
As if I didn't know.            

16:17.810 --> 16:19.643
Now it's his turn.              

16:19.645 --> 16:22.512
One hand washes                 
the other, right?               

16:22.514 --> 16:24.882
No, no, he told me              
to come back at 3:00,           

16:24.884 --> 16:26.216
but don't worry.                

16:26.218 --> 16:29.286
I've got him                    
eating out of my hand.          

16:29.288 --> 16:30.821
Yeah, yeah.                     

16:30.823 --> 16:32.089
Yeah, all right,                
I'll see you later.             

16:41.465 --> 16:43.233
Didn't you make                 
your call?                      

16:43.235 --> 16:44.334
         Don't worry about that.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.736
        I've got something      
        more important than that

16:45.738 --> 16:47.071
                    to tell you.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.106
        Did you see this guy    
        who was on the phone?   

16:49.108 --> 16:51.308
      I heard him. He sounded   
      like a real insider to me.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.110
          From what I heard,    
          I got some information

16:53.112 --> 16:54.912
          that's going to let us
          right off the hook.   

16:54.914 --> 16:56.180
That's wonderful, Archie.       

16:56.182 --> 16:57.247
                I'm telling you,

16:57.249 --> 16:58.816
        I should have           
        thought of it myself.   

16:58.818 --> 17:01.384
         Now, listen, Edith,    
         the examiner in there--

17:01.386 --> 17:04.454
         he's only human, right?

17:04.455 --> 17:05.789
          Now, what can he make?

17:05.790 --> 17:08.925
    A hundred and fifty a week, 
    200 a week tops, that's all.

17:08.928 --> 17:11.361
          So when I go in there,
          what I got to do is   

17:11.363 --> 17:13.163
         I butter him up        
         a little bit, you know?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.164
    Give him the old schmear.   

17:14.165 --> 17:15.799
The old schmear!                

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
What's that?                    

17:16.801 --> 17:18.435
        Shh! Shh!               

17:23.208 --> 17:25.407
          It's a kind of        
          a present, see, Edith?

17:25.410 --> 17:27.676
            I slip him something
            on the side there   

17:27.679 --> 17:29.312
              in return         
              for a little favor

17:29.314 --> 17:30.848
                 that he's going
                 to do me.      

17:30.850 --> 17:33.917
Oh, that don't sound            
too honest.                     

17:33.919 --> 17:36.887
            Oh, Edith, the whole
            world does it.      

17:36.889 --> 17:38.088
        It's what do you call...

17:38.090 --> 17:39.389
        wash your hands, see.   

17:45.730 --> 17:49.066
Oh, Archie, I can't believe     
that nobody's honest.           

17:49.068 --> 17:50.067
RECEPTIONIST:                   
Mr. Bunker.                     

17:50.069 --> 17:52.269
                That's us.      
                Yeah, all right.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.470
    Edith, come on. Come on.    

17:53.472 --> 17:55.272
  Put your coat on, will you?   

17:55.274 --> 17:56.273
First room                      
on the right.                   

17:56.275 --> 17:57.274
             Where?             

17:57.276 --> 17:58.275
First room                      
on the right.                   

17:58.277 --> 17:59.777
 On the right, yeah.            
                      Thank you.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.511
                 Come on, Edith.
                 Hurry up, huh? 

18:13.357 --> 18:15.292
          I'm Turner.           
    I think we've met.          

18:16.928 --> 18:18.361
 You're the tax examiner here?  

18:18.363 --> 18:20.363
      That's right, I am.       
 Won't you come in, Mr. Bunker? 

18:20.365 --> 18:21.364
Yeah, yeah.                     

18:21.366 --> 18:22.766
Thanks very much,               
there, uh...                    

18:22.768 --> 18:24.802
Get in here, Edith.             

18:24.804 --> 18:26.636
                And this must be
                Mrs. Bunker.    

18:26.638 --> 18:27.704
That's right.                   

18:27.706 --> 18:28.839
                Won't you sit   
                down, please?   

18:28.841 --> 18:31.108
         Yeah, thanks.          
Sit down, sit down, Edith.      

18:31.110 --> 18:33.410
    Uh, see, I'm sorry          
    for what happened           

18:33.412 --> 18:35.045
     out there in the hall.     

18:35.047 --> 18:37.247
            Uh, you know, uh,   
            bumping into me,    

18:37.249 --> 18:40.851
            which is to say,    
            my bumping into you.

18:40.853 --> 18:43.787
          I-- I, uh, got        
          my leg hurt, you know,

18:43.789 --> 18:46.089
      and it's an old war wound.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.892
Archie, you never               
told me about that.             

18:53.131 --> 18:56.399
    That's because I didn't want
    to worry you, Edith.        

18:56.401 --> 18:58.668
     Are you all right now?     

18:58.670 --> 19:00.403
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.739
      You know, you learn       
to live with them things.       

19:02.741 --> 19:04.674
Good, let's get to your problem.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.676
      Yeah, well, listen,       
  before we start, Mr. Turner   

19:06.678 --> 19:08.478
         just one thing         
     I want to say to you.      

19:08.480 --> 19:11.715
 Uh... I ain't like them other  
  crooks out there, you know.   

19:11.717 --> 19:13.817
        I mean, I didn't        
  have to be dragged in here.   

19:13.819 --> 19:16.653
    See, I volunteer to come    
down here on my own hook.       

19:16.655 --> 19:18.255
      You tell him, Edith,      
    and keep it short.          

19:19.490 --> 19:21.191
That's right, Mr. Turner.       

19:21.193 --> 19:23.260
Archie volunteered              
to come down                    

19:23.262 --> 19:25.062
as soon as he found out         

19:25.064 --> 19:26.696
he might have                   
to go to prison.                

19:35.273 --> 19:37.407
            Don't say a thing   
            like that, Edith.   

19:37.409 --> 19:39.509
          Mr. Turner might think
          you mean it, there.   

19:39.511 --> 19:40.643
        Edith's only fooling.   

19:40.645 --> 19:41.945
            She's always kidding
            around. Ha-ha.      

19:44.082 --> 19:45.282
    I see you want to amend     

19:45.284 --> 19:47.317
        your last year's        
        tax return. Why?        

19:47.319 --> 19:48.818
         Oh, well, see,         

19:48.820 --> 19:53.623
    I-- I forgot to declare     
    $680 extra that I made.     

19:53.625 --> 19:55.192
Well, how did that happen?      

19:55.194 --> 19:57.560
    Well, in the first place,   
    I had all the figures       

19:57.562 --> 19:59.096
            wrote down          
            on a piece of paper,

19:59.098 --> 20:01.831
        and then my wife, Edith,
        here, she threw it away,

20:01.833 --> 20:03.233
                  and then I got
                  all balled up,

20:03.235 --> 20:04.434
            and the return      
            was getting late.   

20:04.436 --> 20:06.103
        I thought               
    I was going to be late.     

20:06.105 --> 20:07.304
You know, after all, Mr. Turner,

20:07.306 --> 20:08.505
  see, I'm only a little guy,   

20:08.507 --> 20:10.307
      and I ain't like one      
    of your big corporations    

20:10.309 --> 20:13.043
can run down to H&R Block       
  whenever they got a problem.  

20:21.519 --> 20:22.652
    Okay, Mr. Bunker.           

20:22.654 --> 20:24.454
      This extra income--       
    how did you come by it?     

20:24.456 --> 20:26.924
Oh, he didn't come by it,       
          Mr. Turner.           

20:26.926 --> 20:28.858
    He worked for it.           

20:28.860 --> 20:31.694
    He made it driving a cab    
          on Sundays.           

20:31.696 --> 20:33.096
             I see.             

20:33.098 --> 20:34.398
Yeah, that's right, Mr. Turner. 

20:34.400 --> 20:35.598
 I want to tell you something.  

20:35.600 --> 20:36.633
  Even holding down two jobs,   

20:36.635 --> 20:38.501
        it's awful hard         
    for a guy like me           

20:38.503 --> 20:40.270
  to make ends meet nowadays.   

20:40.272 --> 20:42.372
      Like, for instance,       
        last week here,         

20:42.374 --> 20:44.841
we had chicken four times.      

20:44.843 --> 20:47.744
Now, I know yous people love it,
 but it drives me up the wall.  

20:55.886 --> 20:57.387
        I hate chicken.         

20:57.389 --> 21:00.324
 You hate chicken. No kidding.  

21:00.326 --> 21:02.125
Yeah, but if it'd make you      
        feel any better         

21:02.127 --> 21:04.127
    I love watermelon.          

21:12.036 --> 21:13.636
      Now, let's get back       
     to this tax situation.     

21:13.638 --> 21:15.872
          By the way,           
  about that situation there,   

21:15.874 --> 21:18.041
             I hear             
  that's all gonna be fixed up  

21:18.043 --> 21:19.242
        by Mr. McGovern.        

21:19.244 --> 21:20.944
        McGovern?               

21:20.946 --> 21:22.946
          Yeah, he says he's    
          going to fix it all up

21:22.948 --> 21:23.981
             for the little guy.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.382
            He's going to get   
            at them millionaires

21:25.384 --> 21:26.583
              with the great big
              tax loopholes.    

21:26.585 --> 21:27.784
 So you're a McGovern man, huh? 

21:27.786 --> 21:30.687
            Oh, are you kidding?

21:30.689 --> 21:33.090
Archie...                       
but I thought you...            

21:33.092 --> 21:37.260
             I'm a McGovern man.
             McGovern.          

21:37.262 --> 21:39.329
  Well, I'd like to discuss it  
     with you, Mr. Bunker,      

21:39.331 --> 21:41.331
     but we're not allowed      
  to talk politics on the job.  

21:41.333 --> 21:42.866
Archie, I didn't                
know you was...                 

21:42.868 --> 21:45.135
        Edith, did you hear     
        what Mr. Turner said?   

21:45.137 --> 21:46.936
     He ain't allowed to discuss
     politics on the job,       

21:46.938 --> 21:47.804
                 and he's right.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.241
    Well, Mr. Bunker,           
      the way I figure it,      

21:51.243 --> 21:54.077
     you owe the government     
        exactly $140.08.        

21:54.079 --> 21:55.612
             Uh...              

21:55.614 --> 21:57.447
            listen,             
let me ask you something.       

21:59.950 --> 22:01.351
  You ever go out on Sundays?   

22:01.353 --> 22:02.652
        Sometimes.              

22:03.921 --> 22:06.990
    How would you like          
        a free cab ride?        

22:11.862 --> 22:12.929
    How would I like a what?    

22:14.065 --> 22:15.065
      You want to go out?       

22:15.067 --> 22:16.466
 I'll get the cab, pick you up, 

22:16.468 --> 22:18.868
     take you to any place      
  in the city you want to go.   

22:18.870 --> 22:20.603
     Get you back to Harlem     
    before nightfall.           

22:28.612 --> 22:32.015
          Mr. Bunker,           
    I live in Far Rockaway,     

22:32.017 --> 22:33.283
    and I drive my own car.     

22:33.285 --> 22:35.318
Oh, you drive your own car, huh?

22:35.320 --> 22:36.319
                        Yeah.   

22:36.321 --> 22:38.121
  Well, hey, hey, hey, listen.  

22:38.123 --> 22:39.589
A guy drives his own car--      

22:39.591 --> 22:41.791
I'll bet you could use a couple 
    of brand-new tires, huh?    

22:41.793 --> 22:43.793
I know where I could            
lay my hands on some.           

22:43.795 --> 22:45.795
        Uh, my wife's cousin,   
        Howard,                 

22:45.797 --> 22:48.031
              he left them to me
              when he died.     

22:48.033 --> 22:51.168
I don't remember                
any cousin Howard.              

22:51.170 --> 22:53.002
         That's because he died.

22:54.672 --> 22:58.007
     See, that's Edith all over.
     Out of sight, out of mind. 

22:58.009 --> 22:59.209
             Well, how about it,
             Mr. Turner?        

22:59.211 --> 23:00.343
         Can you use them tires?

23:00.345 --> 23:02.479
          Mr. Bunker,           
  are you trying to bribe me?   

23:02.481 --> 23:04.747
 No, no, no. Nothing like that. 

23:06.484 --> 23:08.085
      I guess I'm getting       
    overly suspicious,          

23:08.087 --> 23:09.219
because just this morning       

23:09.221 --> 23:10.587
