<i>L is for the way you look at me</i>

00:29.634 --> 00:36.166
<i>O is for the only one I see</i>

00:36.167 --> 00:42.560
<i>V is very, very extraordinary</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:37.696
Sweet on you

00:38.991 --> 00:40.067
Release the hounds

00:42.567 --> 00:46.529
<i>E is even more than
anyone that you adore</i>

00:46.530 --> 00:50.193
I can't wait to see my
Valentine's Day surprise.

00:50.202 --> 00:53.026
Good, 'cause I'm parking
at it right now.

00:54.178 --> 00:55.990
A carnival?

00:56.033 --> 00:58.159
What's so romantic
about this?

00:58.157 --> 00:59.529
- Bye!
- See you later!

00:59.528 --> 01:02.795
For the next two hours,
we'll be kid-free.

01:02.799 --> 01:06.091
It'll be just like the time
we lost them at the mall.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.671
That was the best
Christmas ever.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.202
Ah, the Tunnel of Love.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.681
Nothing gets a woman
in your arms faster

01:15.685 --> 01:18.450
than scary robots
and simulated privacy.

01:33.496 --> 01:34.670
Marge!
Look over there!

01:39.845 --> 01:41.201
Mom and Dad are in there.

01:41.206 --> 01:42.221
Want to ruin
their fun?

01:42.225 --> 01:44.623
Bart, no, it's
Valentine's Day.

01:44.626 --> 01:45.470
Okay...

01:45.475 --> 01:47.001
but if Dad kisses
Mom too much,

01:47.007 --> 01:48.711
a stork will lay an angel
egg in her tummy,

01:48.718 --> 01:49.833
and the next thing you know,

01:49.837 --> 01:51.831
we find a baby brother
in the cabbage patch!

01:51.838 --> 01:53.021
Here's a thumbnail sketch:

01:54.535 --> 01:56.332
In the first place, you...

01:56.455 --> 01:57.682
Do whatever you want.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.191
I'm getting a candy apple.

02:18.626 --> 02:20.462
Due to a classic Jell-O prank,

02:20.466 --> 02:22.222
this ride has been disabled.

02:24.297 --> 02:26.231
Please remain in your boats.

02:26.275 --> 02:27.871
You will be charged
for the extra time.

02:29.885 --> 02:32.763
This is a terrible
Valentine's Day.

02:32.766 --> 02:34.602
What if I told you
some of the greatest

02:34.607 --> 02:36.593
love stories of all time?

02:38.557 --> 02:39.743
"Romeo and Juliet"?

02:39.776 --> 02:40.930
"Arthur and Guinevere"?

02:40.955 --> 02:41.980
Brangelina?

02:43.857 --> 02:46.190
Even better, a tale of...

02:46.196 --> 02:47.122
One moment.

02:48.795 --> 02:53.402
A tale of two young
outlaws in love.

02:53.688 --> 02:56.443
<i>They were the Bonnie and Clyde
of their day.</i>

02:56.448 --> 02:59.053
<i>Their names were
Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

02:59.116 --> 03:00.253
Miss Bonnie,

03:00.258 --> 03:02.913
might I escort you
to the picture show?

03:02.918 --> 03:04.980
I swear I won't misbehave.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.401
Then no, thank you.

03:06.406 --> 03:07.922
This is Texas,

03:07.925 --> 03:10.343
future home of
Akeem Olajuwon!

03:10.346 --> 03:12.613
And I've got dreams
as big as he will be.

03:12.618 --> 03:14.090
I want action!

03:14.896 --> 03:16.311
Action, eh?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.650
Clyde Barrow,

03:19.655 --> 03:21.031
local bad boy.

03:21.036 --> 03:22.253
Bonnie Parker.

03:22.258 --> 03:24.262
Say, if you're so bad,

03:24.265 --> 03:27.921
you could go stick up that
feed store over yonder.

03:28.636 --> 03:29.472
Hmm.

03:29.487 --> 03:30.821
Unless...

03:30.827 --> 03:32.543
you're chicken.

03:32.547 --> 03:34.452
No one calls me "chicken" without

03:34.455 --> 03:36.802
goading me into
doing something stupid!

03:43.306 --> 03:44.250
Ya idjit!

03:44.258 --> 03:46.570
You could've had anything
you want for free!

03:46.585 --> 03:48.433
You're a co-owner!

03:48.516 --> 03:50.772
I'll see you at Thanksgiving!

03:54.916 --> 03:55.690
Oats!

03:55.705 --> 03:58.022
Texas caviar!

04:01.226 --> 04:02.513
Good times.

04:04.685 --> 04:07.193
Finally.
Some excitement.

04:07.196 --> 04:10.523
<i>Wow, I guess violence
is her only turn-on.</i>

04:10.527 --> 04:11.503
<i>Well, there might be others,</i>

04:11.508 --> 04:13.233
<i>but I'm too lazy to
figure out what they are.</i>

04:13.237 --> 04:14.611
<i>So violence it is!</i>

04:15.247 --> 04:18.372
Oh, there's somethin'
this kissin' is missin'.

04:23.465 --> 04:26.591
Oh, Clyde, you know
just what a girl likes.

04:31.107 --> 04:32.431
Why are you shooting at us?

04:32.437 --> 04:33.781
We cooperated fully!

04:33.788 --> 04:34.952
It's a sex thing!

04:34.955 --> 04:36.011
Say no more!

04:37.436 --> 04:38.942
Hey, can I give you folks a lift?

04:38.947 --> 04:41.621
Yes, to a series of banks,
up and down the state.

04:41.625 --> 04:42.202
Banks?

04:42.206 --> 04:44.050
Well, deposit yourselves in a seat

04:44.055 --> 04:45.631
because you've earned my interest!

04:51.308 --> 04:52.471
Dateline: Texas.

04:52.486 --> 04:55.981
<i>A nation, crippled by unemployment
and bored by Seabiscuit,</i>

04:55.987 --> 04:58.751
<i>embraces two unlikely folk heroes.</i>

05:00.005 --> 05:03.863
<i>Bonnie and Clyde souvenirs
are flying off the shelves,</i>

05:03.867 --> 05:07.751
<i>and the Dust Bowl duo has
inspired their own radio show.</i>

05:07.755 --> 05:10.302
Uh, Bonnie, where did you
put the money we stole?

05:10.308 --> 05:11.641
I filed it under "G."

05:11.646 --> 05:12.521
Under "G"?

05:12.528 --> 05:14.101
Why would you
file it under "G"?

05:14.106 --> 05:16.510
Because gee, it's swell
to have all that money.

05:16.518 --> 05:17.201
I see.

05:18.256 --> 05:21.842
Their notoriety has reached
the highest levels of government

05:21.847 --> 05:24.693
To deal with the menace
of Bonnie and Clyde,

05:24.698 --> 05:29.460
I am recalling all our air
defense forces from Pearl Harbor.

05:30.467 --> 05:33.600
Somebody please remind
me to move them back.

05:33.605 --> 05:37.051
I would be honored to perform that duty.

05:37.076 --> 05:38.563
They're outlaws?!

05:38.598 --> 05:40.812
I've been played
like a pair of spoons!

05:40.818 --> 05:42.261
Well, who am I to judge?

05:42.266 --> 05:44.243
It's the Depression, money's tight...

05:44.245 --> 05:46.753
<i>Anyone who sees this
unmarried couple should...</i>

05:46.755 --> 05:47.761
Unmarried?!

05:47.766 --> 05:49.570
That's it.
I'm turning them in.

05:49.577 --> 05:50.951
Hey, keep it down, will ya?

05:50.957 --> 05:53.121
The part where all my men
get killed is coming up.

05:53.126 --> 05:56.173
Listen, Sheriff, I can help
you take down Bonnie and Clyde.

05:56.196 --> 05:58.932
After the racially
insensitive cartoon.

06:02.728 --> 06:04.672
One taco coming up.

06:17.817 --> 06:19.382
Even I'm offended by this,

06:19.388 --> 06:21.542
and I'm a fat Southern sheriff.

06:24.295 --> 06:25.082
Um...

06:25.096 --> 06:26.683
the battery seems
to be dead.

06:26.696 --> 06:29.391
I'll get some help by
hiding in that bush.

06:29.976 --> 06:31.991
Come on, shoot! Shoot!

06:32.097 --> 06:33.993
Oh! Not me!

06:36.646 --> 06:38.112
Bonnie, I love you.

06:38.117 --> 06:39.031
Will you marry me?

06:39.036 --> 06:40.271
I don't know.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.890
I guess I'm just looking
for a little more excitement.

06:42.895 --> 06:46.180
Okay, but if you change your mind,
you know where I'm at.

06:46.196 --> 06:48.780
Mm, I think we should see other people.

06:48.785 --> 06:50.270
Say, Officer,

06:50.278 --> 06:52.303
I like how you handle that gun.

06:52.337 --> 06:52.990
Thanks.

06:53.086 --> 06:55.190
I like the way
you take a bullet.

06:55.358 --> 06:57.393
Hey, back off!
She's my girl!

06:57.395 --> 06:59.302
Damn, just my luck!

07:01.737 --> 07:03.591
Cool. Now we're shooting the birds

07:03.597 --> 07:05.283
that are pecking at the bodies.

07:12.526 --> 07:14.201
So that's the end
of the story, huh?

07:14.206 --> 07:15.183
You'd think so, but...

07:19.965 --> 07:21.543
We want to hear a story.

07:21.547 --> 07:23.480
A story suitable for children.

07:23.507 --> 07:24.190
All right.

07:24.206 --> 07:27.940
This is a story of two
dogs with a love so strong,

07:27.943 --> 07:30.139
no hose could separate them.

07:30.137 --> 07:32.649
I call it Shady and the Vamp.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.595
She's so beautiful.

07:44.599 --> 07:47.752
Imagine what she looks
like with her collar off.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.913
A mutt like you could never
get a fancy dame like that.

07:50.918 --> 07:53.240
Even her fleas have more class than you.

07:54.547 --> 07:59.660
Lady Bitington, will you be summering
in the hindquarters again this year?

07:59.745 --> 08:00.821
Oh, no!

08:00.828 --> 08:03.953
Chompy and I have taken
a cottage in West Leg.

08:03.956 --> 08:06.721
It's where all the fleas are fleeing.

08:08.546 --> 08:10.801
Watch and learn.

08:16.918 --> 08:20.481
You know, heaven must have
left its doggie door open

08:20.486 --> 08:22.760
because you are one...

08:27.295 --> 08:30.923
Oh, you poor thing!

08:34.424 --> 08:36.120
Is there anything I can do?

08:36.136 --> 08:38.520
You can have dinner with me.

08:38.645 --> 08:39.900
All right.

08:39.908 --> 08:41.652
But keep your nose
where I can see it.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.071
Can you bring
a friend for me?

08:43.076 --> 08:45.203
I like those chicks
with them head cones

08:45.205 --> 08:48.022
when they start talking, you
can drop below the horizon.

08:58.328 --> 09:00.730
Oh, Shady, you on a date, huh?

09:00.736 --> 09:02.071
How's it-a goin'?

09:02.817 --> 09:05.362
You say it's goin' kinda-a rough?

09:05.367 --> 09:07.551
That is precisely
what I'm saying.

09:07.557 --> 09:08.841
Sit down. Sit down.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.250
I bring-a you a
nice-a bowl of Chianti.

09:25.918 --> 09:27.411
Let go! Let go!

09:27.415 --> 09:30.142
No. You let go of the spaghetti!

09:35.225 --> 09:38.413
You're pretty feisty
for an upper-class bitch.

09:39.108 --> 09:43.042
Oh, I like that you use the
technical termfor a female dog.

09:43.048 --> 09:44.081
Run, run!

09:44.086 --> 09:47.161
The health inspector man,
he's-a here!

09:49.126 --> 09:51.521
Why didn't I listen to Mama?

09:51.527 --> 09:54.133
"Serve-a food to humans!"

09:57.578 --> 10:00.783
I have to admit,
that was exciting.

10:00.786 --> 10:03.021
And I am in heat.

10:03.026 --> 10:04.412
That's the safe time, right?

10:04.417 --> 10:06.090
Oh, the safest.

10:15.828 --> 10:17.763
That was the most...

10:17.768 --> 10:20.851
wonderful night of my life.

10:21.376 --> 10:22.390
That's odd.

10:22.398 --> 10:24.021
I'm never sickin
the morning.

10:24.026 --> 10:25.161
What could it be?

10:25.165 --> 10:25.973
Oh, uh...

10:25.988 --> 10:27.832
Is that a foxhunt I hear?

10:33.347 --> 10:35.232
Shady!

10:37.318 --> 10:40.272
I haven't seen Shady in weeks.

10:43.797 --> 10:45.613
Any minute now

10:45.755 --> 10:49.592
He'll scamper through
that doggie door

10:49.595 --> 10:51.272
Any minute now

10:51.506 --> 10:55.251
I'll be the dog
she's lookin' for

10:55.305 --> 10:57.243
Any minute now

10:57.328 --> 11:00.823
You'll be stuck
with her brood

11:01.125 --> 11:02.720
Any minute now

11:02.956 --> 11:07.540
This pooch will know she's screwed

11:08.728 --> 11:12.453
My heart tells
me to trust him

11:12.537 --> 11:16.693
But your head knows
he's a hound

11:16.708 --> 11:19.760
I want to do the right thing

11:19.766 --> 11:23.701
Come on, with all this
high-class tail around?

11:24.425 --> 11:26.441
Any minute now

11:26.446 --> 11:30.391
Our girl will make
a brand-new start

11:30.448 --> 11:31.930
Yesss!

11:31.996 --> 11:34.121
Any minute now

11:34.126 --> 11:38.531
I won't care that
he broke my heart

11:38.648 --> 11:45.340
Any minute now.

11:49.648 --> 11:51.472
- Where's our dad?
- We need Daddy!

11:51.475 --> 11:53.203
- I want to go find Daddy!
- Where's Daddy?!

11:53.205 --> 11:55.623
I don't wanna hear another
word about your father.

12:08.256 --> 12:10.130
We gotta find our daddy.

12:10.135 --> 12:12.281
Yeah, he's gotta teach
me how to lick my...

12:12.375 --> 12:13.960
Oh, I figured it out.

12:13.966 --> 12:14.810
You go ahead.

12:14.816 --> 12:15.921
Come on!

12:16.026 --> 12:17.733
- Oh, Shady!
- Oh, Shady!

12:17.767 --> 12:19.480
- Shady!
- Shady!

12:19.537 --> 12:21.350
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

12:21.358 --> 12:23.853
- We need you, Daddy!
- Daddy!

12:26.136 --> 12:27.402
Ah, got ya!

12:27.407 --> 12:30.220
You strays are going
straight to the pound

12:30.228 --> 12:32.961
where you're put to sleep...

12:32.965 --> 12:35.530
by my boring stories.

12:35.585 --> 12:36.771
And then you'll be killed!

12:41.766 --> 12:44.010
Ah, looks like that problem
solved it self.

12:44.015 --> 12:47.180
Now, uh, how 'bout you and
me sniff each other's butts?

12:48.737 --> 12:49.680
I'm just kiddin'.

12:50.285 --> 12:51.412
Unless you want to.

12:55.987 --> 12:59.381
Well, Looks like it's just
you and me again tonight.

13:11.647 --> 13:13.680
Gawrsh, you can't kill me.

13:13.685 --> 13:15.062
I'm half-human!

13:15.067 --> 13:16.610
Look, I wear clothes!

13:16.618 --> 13:17.870
I speak English!

13:17.888 --> 13:20.021
I'm speaking it right now!

13:20.067 --> 13:21.970
Sure you are.

13:29.805 --> 13:31.753
You two are next.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.401
Here's your last meal.

13:33.407 --> 13:34.822
It's Cycle 5,

13:34.827 --> 13:38.732
specially formulated for
dogs with five minutes to live.

13:41.536 --> 13:43.541
Don't bite the hand
that kills ye!

13:47.268 --> 13:48.431
Yay, Dad!

13:48.438 --> 13:50.401
I knew you'd
come save us!

13:50.766 --> 13:52.211
You two are going home,

13:52.218 --> 13:53.913
and I'm coming with ya!

13:58.148 --> 13:59.971
This place is no picnic,

13:59.976 --> 14:02.553
but it sure beats
working for Disney.

14:11.755 --> 14:13.333
Look who we found!

14:13.338 --> 14:14.773
Can I keep him?
Can we keep him?

14:14.775 --> 14:16.461
Well, that depends.

14:16.466 --> 14:18.171
Does he want to stay?

14:18.178 --> 14:22.030
I want to stay, sit,
roll over and beg!

14:22.037 --> 14:24.842
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please...!

14:24.845 --> 14:28.001
All right,
we can be a family.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.881
All four of us.

14:30.896 --> 14:32.743
Uh... you know,

14:32.745 --> 14:35.140
there are nine other puppies.

14:45.268 --> 14:49.102
Even love is boring when
you're stuck in a tunnel of it.

14:49.108 --> 14:50.851
Well, I've got a
Valentine's Day story!

14:50.857 --> 14:53.223
It's about musicians
from a simpler time.

14:53.228 --> 14:57.083
The era of The Brady Bunch,
Donny and Marie and...

14:58.526 --> 15:00.313
Smash the flag

15:00.348 --> 15:02.200
Burn the queen

15:02.228 --> 15:03.952
Kick the sky

15:04.008 --> 15:06.231
Antichrist!

15:09.905 --> 15:11.543
Nancy, what are the odds?

15:11.558 --> 15:14.153
You sign up for a
semester at U. of London;

15:14.158 --> 15:16.451
then I immediately
do the same.

15:16.455 --> 15:18.633
Yeah, I'm really lucky
you saved me

15:18.638 --> 15:21.940
from meeting other people
and having new experiences.

15:24.028 --> 15:27.052
What is that raw,
primo sound?

15:27.186 --> 15:28.573
You can't go in there.

15:28.576 --> 15:30.462
Our guide book
says not to!

15:32.217 --> 15:33.790
<i>Hitler and her majesty</i>

15:33.835 --> 15:35.460
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

15:35.565 --> 15:38.960
<i>B-O-R-R-I-N-G!</i>

15:38.968 --> 15:40.750
You rule, Sid Vicious!

15:40.757 --> 15:42.142
You sicken me!

15:45.266 --> 15:46.950
Why am I hittin' myself?

15:47.055 --> 15:48.543
Why am I hittin' myself?

15:48.566 --> 15:50.933
He's so uncompromising.

15:50.946 --> 15:54.591
He'd never go for an uncool
spelling bee champion like me.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.442
I've spelled "unrequited."

15:56.448 --> 15:58.513
Now I know
what it means.

15:58.546 --> 16:00.991
Yo. I got Duds, Chunks, Twix,

16:00.996 --> 16:03.081
Cadbury's, any way you want to go.

16:03.085 --> 16:04.313
Chocolate?

16:04.528 --> 16:07.390
Nancy's too smart to
put that in her body.

16:07.396 --> 16:10.570
It's only for losers,
like musicians and...

16:10.586 --> 16:11.781
Musicians?!

16:12.405 --> 16:14.332
That's my girlfriend.

16:14.337 --> 16:16.900
Then I guess you'll be
paying for her chocolate.

16:16.908 --> 16:18.723
Uh, okay.

16:18.727 --> 16:19.423
Gotcha!

16:19.425 --> 16:21.313
That's nice work,
Officer Otto.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.413
Happy to be of service,
old bean.

16:23.438 --> 16:25.340
<i>...cannon, neat, neat, neat</i>

16:25.345 --> 16:27.923
<i>She can't afford a gun at all
Neat, neat, neat.</i>

16:30.217 --> 16:33.413
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

16:33.427 --> 16:34.063
<i>Night!</i>

16:34.067 --> 16:37.141
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

16:37.148 --> 16:37.773
<i>Night!</i>

16:37.775 --> 16:40.652
<i>S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y</i>

16:40.687 --> 16:41.252
<i>Night!</i>

16:48.637 --> 16:51.241
Look, an American
nerd bird.

16:51.248 --> 16:52.283
Nerd bird?

16:52.328 --> 16:54.421
Would a nerd bird
have chocolate, huh?

16:54.428 --> 16:55.791
Would a nerd bird?

16:55.798 --> 16:57.320
Stop saying "nerd bird!"

16:57.327 --> 16:58.813
Chocolate is boring.

16:58.816 --> 17:00.542
Maybe I'll have a piece.

17:00.546 --> 17:03.903
You know, just to see
how boring it is.

17:07.948 --> 17:10.021
Oh, you're offering
me some?

17:10.025 --> 17:11.902
Um... I guess I could.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.050
I mean, I do it all the time!

17:17.957 --> 17:19.381
- Oh!
- Oh!

17:20.726 --> 17:23.060
Yup, it's boring all right.

17:23.075 --> 17:24.292
How much more you got?

17:24.345 --> 17:25.212
Lots.

17:25.396 --> 17:27.723
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone?</i>

17:27.724 --> 17:30.472
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

17:30.485 --> 17:32.970
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

17:32.975 --> 17:35.023
<i>You shouldn't've
fallen in love with?</i>

17:36.388 --> 17:38.731
<i>I can't see much of a future</i>

17:39.198 --> 17:41.633
<i>Unless we find out
what's to blame</i>

17:41.635 --> 17:43.192
<i>What a shame</i>

17:47.138 --> 17:49.592
<i>And we won't be
together much longer</i>

17:49.917 --> 17:53.850
<i>Unless we realize
that we are the same</i>

17:57.697 --> 17:59.871
<i>Ever fallen in love
with someone</i>

17:59.878 --> 18:02.543
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

18:02.547 --> 18:05.293
<i>Ever fallen in love
In love with someone</i>

18:05.298 --> 18:08.102
<i>You shouldn't've fallen
in love with?</i>

18:12.618 --> 18:15.332
We're gonna go out
and play our songs

18:15.335 --> 18:18.263
like we've never played them
before: competently!

18:19.268 --> 18:20.420
Where's Sid?

18:22.205 --> 18:24.200
Sidney Sheldon Vicious!

18:24.205 --> 18:26.751
Where you been,
chompin' Wonka?

18:29.498 --> 18:32.303
When I hired a guy
named Sid Vicious,

18:32.307 --> 18:35.573
I assumed it would be a 30-year
business relationship.

18:35.585 --> 18:38.720
I told you to hire
Tom Responsible.

18:38.727 --> 18:40.043
Slag off.

18:40.538 --> 18:43.642
Here they are, all the way
from outside of Texas:

18:43.646 --> 18:45.652
the Sex Pistols.

18:48.657 --> 18:50.523
<i>Education's bollocks!</i>

18:51.058 --> 18:53.903
<i>Bollocks!
America is bollocks!</i>

18:54.145 --> 18:56.872
<i>Bollocks!
Politeness is bollocks!</i>

18:57.288 --> 18:59.400
<i>Bollocks!
Bollocks!</i>

19:00.307 --> 19:02.153
Can't reach me bass.

19:02.178 --> 19:03.920
Me back is front ward!

19:10.105 --> 19:13.892
Dang it, I wanted to hear
what else was bollocks!

19:17.968 --> 19:20.600
You gobbed up our gig,
you git!

19:22.446 --> 19:25.510
You leave Sid alone!
He doesn't need you!

19:25.515 --> 19:27.420
He's quitting the band!

19:27.428 --> 19:28.812
I'm doing what now?

19:28.816 --> 19:30.071
You're quitting the band.

19:30.076 --> 19:32.692
He's going solo, and I'm
gonna write his songs!

19:32.697 --> 19:33.540
Yeah!

19:33.556 --> 19:35.723
Hey, you guys want to
be in my new band?

19:35.727 --> 19:37.741
Ho!! Just stop talking

19:37.745 --> 19:40.071
and bang your head
against the wall!

19:41.055 --> 19:42.781
I'm doing this
'cause I want to,

19:42.785 --> 19:44.301
not 'cause she told me to.

19:44.306 --> 19:45.673
Bang harder!

19:45.675 --> 19:46.301
Yes, pet.

19:50.688 --> 19:53.353
<i>'Cause love is the elixir</i>

19:53.355 --> 19:56.000
<i>The potion of emotion</i>

19:56.005 --> 19:58.543
<i>The world-saving fixer</i>

19:58.546 --> 20:01.382
<i>The lotion of devotion.</i>

20:01.467 --> 20:03.831
This song doesn't make
me feel angry at all.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.643
If anything, it makes
my anger ebb!

20:08.466 --> 20:11.310
Your music violates everything
punk stands for,

20:11.327 --> 20:12.302
which is nothing!

20:12.318 --> 20:14.340
You are no longer
welcome at CBGB's...

20:14.345 --> 20:16.300
Comic Book Guy's Bar

20:16.306 --> 20:17.971
Oh, forget those jerks.

20:17.978 --> 20:20.970
Let's go back to the hotel
and get Snicker-faced.

20:20.978 --> 20:24.193
Oh, I love you,
my Hershey hero.

20:24.196 --> 20:26.683
And I love you,
Tootsie Roll.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.291
Happy Valentine's Day

20:39.308 --> 20:41.260
and shut your gob.
