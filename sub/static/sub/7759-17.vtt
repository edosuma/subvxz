00:39.873 --> 00:43.043
[indistinct chatter]

00:46.447 --> 00:48.447
- I'M GONNA FUCK YOU.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.052
I'M GONNA FUCK YOU
ALL NIGHT LONG.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.224
- WE'RE GONNA BE LATE,
ALL RIGHT?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.686
- I'M COMING, I'M COMING.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.194
- DIDN'T YOU GET ENOUGH?

00:58.226 --> 00:59.686
- NEVER ENOUGH.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.397
- WHY DON'T WE SAVE IT
TILL THE WEEKEND?

01:01.429 --> 01:03.859
- WHY DON'T WE SAVE IT
TILL WE GET TO THE CAR?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.197
- I WAS THINKING...

01:06.234 --> 01:07.874
THAT WE COULD GO AWAY,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.441
SNOWBOARDING.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.270
- COOL, EXCEPT THERE'S NO SNOW.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.135
- IN VERMONT.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.444
DAPHNE WAS JUST THERE
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.775
SHE SAID IT WAS AMAZING.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.249
THEY STAYED IN THIS
AWESOME PLACE.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.508
IT WAS A CONVERTED FARMHOUSE,

01:18.546 --> 01:20.646
AND EVERY ROOM HAD
A FIREPLACE AND A JACUZZI.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.381
- DID THEY HAVE THOSE LITTLE
MINTS ON THE PILLOWS?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.247
- I FORGOT, BRIAN KINNEY
DOESN'T DO ROMANCE.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.686
- I DON'T NEED AN EXCUSE
TO FUCK.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.690
- YOU ALSO DON'T NEED
AN EXCUSE TO TURN ME DOWN.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.193
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT

01:31.225 --> 01:34.425
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY
WITH ME FOR THE WEEKEND?

01:34.462 --> 01:38.232
- I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY
WITH YOU FOR THE WEEKEND.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.766
- WELL, AT LEAST IT'S OUT
IN THE OPEN.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.640
- I WANT TO GO AWAY WITH YOU
FOR THE WHOLE FUCKING WEEK.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.899
- RIGHT.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.606
- HEY, IF YOU'RE
NOT INTERESTED,

01:44.638 --> 01:47.608
I CAN FIND SOMEBODY WHO IS.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.211
A WEEK WITH ME IN VERMONT?

01:49.243 --> 01:52.313
JACUZZI, FIREPLACE?

01:52.346 --> 01:55.446
GUESS IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.623
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:56.650 --> 01:57.790
- YOU'RE OFF ON SPRING BREAK.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.248
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE PARTNER,

01:59.287 --> 02:01.187
WHICH I'D SAY
MORE THAN ENTITLES ME

02:01.222 --> 02:03.362
TO A WEEK OF SNOWBOARDING

02:03.391 --> 02:04.731
AND FUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.198
- REALLY?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.769
- DID YOU PUT GUS DOWN?

02:17.805 --> 02:22.505
- YEP, HE'S ALL
SNUGGLED UP IN HIS BED.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.713
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.218
- OH, POOR BABY.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.780
YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.588
- SO DO YOU.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.515
- ROLL OVER.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.187
- WHAT FOR?

02:38.226 --> 02:40.926
- GO AHEAD.
COME ON.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.261
- AHH!
WHOO.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.256
- FACE DOWN.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.667
- OOH, YES, SIR.
MA'AM.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.768
[giggling]

02:51.472 --> 02:54.942
- AH, YOU ARE GOING
TO LOVE THIS.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.675
- [sigh of contentment]

02:58.712 --> 02:59.712
- THAT'S IT.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.277
- THAT FEELS GOOD.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.586
- LET ALL THE TENSION GO.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.290
[door opens]

03:07.321 --> 03:08.391
- JUST FINISHED THE FLOORS.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.892
THEY LOOK GREAT.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.693
- THAT'S NICE.

03:11.725 --> 03:12.785
- 'NIGHT.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.326
- 'NIGHT.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.274
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE GONE
WITH THE HARDWOOD

03:18.299 --> 03:19.399
INSTEAD OF THE PINE.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.243
- DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
JUST RELAX.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.620
NOW ROLL OVER.

03:39.687 --> 03:43.517
THIS IS A SPECIAL FORM
OF MASSAGE...

03:45.826 --> 03:48.296
CALLED FOREPLAY.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.367
- OH, I'VE MISSED THIS.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.807
- ME TOO.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.045
GOD, YOU'RE SO HOT.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.950
- [stifled yawn]

04:09.983 --> 04:12.523
OH, SO ARE YOU.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.084
- YOU KNOW,
THE GOOD THING

04:42.115 --> 04:43.515
ABOUT NOT BALANCING
YOUR CHECK BOOK

04:43.551 --> 04:44.691
IS THAT WHEN YOU FINALLY DO,

04:44.718 --> 04:45.948
YOU GET TO RELIVE
ALL YOUR PURCHASES.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.916
OOH, THE PLEASURE VAULT.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.055
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME SEE.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.661
- NO, NO.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.033
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,

04:54.061 --> 04:58.371
IN THE FUTURE,
BALANCE BEFORE YOU BUY.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.469
HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST ME
THIS TIME?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.771
- UM, 50?

05:01.802 --> 05:04.412
- YEAH, UH, CLOSER TO 80,

05:04.438 --> 05:05.768
IF I WANT TO TURN
MY PHONE BACK ON.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.676
- TRY 100 IF YOU'D LIKE
TO PAY HALF THE ELECTRIC.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.816
- SO IS HE AS GOOD
AS HE LOOKS?

05:14.848 --> 05:17.418
AND SPARE US
YOUR MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.751
I WANT DETAILS.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.586
- FIRST I MADE HIM
WORSHIP MY COCK FOR AN HOUR.

05:21.622 --> 05:25.092
THEN I LET HIM RIM ME
FOR A GOOD 45 MINUTES,

05:25.125 --> 05:27.625
AND AFTER THAT I FUCKED HIM
SO HARD HE PASSED OUT.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.131
I'M SURPRISED HE'S UP
AND WALKING AROUND.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.702
- OOH, CAN THE SEX TALK.
LESBIAN APPROACHING.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.072
- HMM, YOU KIDDING?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.470
MEL AND LINZ ARE A COUPLE
OF SEX MACHINES.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.543
THEY SOAK THE SHEETS.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.140
- HEY, I DON'T CARE
TO DISCUSS MY PERSONAL LIFE

05:38.171 --> 05:41.111
WITH A BUNCH
OF FOUL-MOUTHED FAGS.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.081
- WELL, SOMEBODY'S
ON THE RAG.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.850
- OR NOT GETTING ANY.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.608
- YOU SEE HOW MUCH YOU GET WHEN
YOU HAVE A FAMILY TO SUPPORT,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.717
A KID TO RAISE,
AND A MAJOR RENOVATION GOING ON

05:48.749 --> 05:50.019
UNDER YOUR ROOF.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.650
BUT OF COURSE YOU NEVER WILL

05:51.685 --> 05:54.455
SINCE YOUR ONLY RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO YOUR DICKS.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.088
- WHICH IS WHY I'M SMILING,
AND YOU'RE NOT.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.463
- SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
A CASE OF L.B.D.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.163
- DUN-DUN-DUN!

06:02.195 --> 06:04.125
- WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?
- LESBIAN BED DEATH.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.874
- YOU KNOW, FIRST IT DRIES UP,

06:05.899 --> 06:07.739
THEN IT SHRIVELS UP,
THEN IT CLOSES UP,

06:07.768 --> 06:09.168
THEN IT DISAPPEARS.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.372
- HOW COME I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THIS?

06:10.404 --> 06:13.744
- BECAUSE IT ONLY EXISTS IN
THE MINDS OF CUNTY GAY MEN.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.014
- REOW!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.612
- DON'T WORRY, MEL,
THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.114
NEW DEVELOPMENTS
ARE EMERGING EVERY DAY.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.875
- THERE'S GOING TO BE
A TELETHON.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.483
- YEAH, WE'RE ALL
GONNA WEAR LITTLE, UM,

06:21.515 --> 06:22.845
FUCHSIA RIBBONS ON OUR LAPELS.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.853
[laughter]

06:24.885 --> 06:28.115
- SEE YOU, MEL.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.715
- HE WANTS TO SEE YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.858
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.162
- HE'S BEEN ON THE PHONE
ALL MORNING WITH HIS ATTORNEY.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.034
CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.603
- HE'S DIVORCING HIS WIFE?

06:37.631 --> 06:40.671
- HE'S MAKING YOU PARTNER.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.801
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
SO EXCITED ABOUT?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.166
- I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.705
AND THE PARTNER'S ASSISTANT
GETS TO BE A RAVING BITCH

06:47.741 --> 06:48.781
TO EVERYBODY.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.809
- [chuckles]

06:49.843 --> 06:51.013
- NOW GET IN THERE.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.854
AND GOOD LUCK, PARTNER.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.951
- BRIAN.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.823
- WHAT'S UP?

06:57.851 --> 07:00.751
- BIG CHANGE COMING.
- OH?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.888
- I SOLD THE AGENCY.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.734
- WHAT?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.029
- TO GARDNER VANCE.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.560
HE'S BEEN ON MY TAIL
FOR OVER A YEAR,

07:08.596 --> 07:10.956
FINALLY MADE ME AN OFFER
I COULDN'T REFUSE.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.898
[laughs, drums on desk]

07:13.934 --> 07:15.244
NOW I CAN BUY
THAT PLACE IN BERMUDA,

07:15.268 --> 07:18.238
RETIRE AND PLAY GOLF
UNTIL I DROP.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.941
POP!
OH.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.244
- CONGRATULATIONS.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.005
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

07:27.014 --> 07:28.824
YOU MADE ME A PROMISE.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.579
IF WE HAD ANOTHER
5 MILLION-PLUS YEAR--

07:30.618 --> 07:32.618
- LOOK, I HAD NO CHOICE.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.053
OKAY?
I HAD TO SELL.

07:34.087 --> 07:37.017
- YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A COMPANY
WORTH BUYING WITHOUT ME.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.687
I BROUGHT IN OVER A THIRD
OF YOUR ACCOUNTS.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.726
- AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

07:39.760 --> 07:41.090
THAT VANCE KNOWS
ALL ABOUT THAT.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.728
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU ARE GONNA BE HIS GUY.

07:42.763 --> 07:46.703
HE NEEDS YOU.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.044
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.698
- [scoffs]

07:56.744 --> 07:59.154
- WELL, WITH THE MONEY
TEDDY LOANED ME,

07:59.179 --> 08:04.179
MY NEW BALANCE
SHOULD BE $147.16.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.887
- SO WERE YOUR
CALCULATIONS ACCURATE?

08:07.921 --> 08:11.091
- JUST A SMIDGE OFF.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.964
THIS SAYS I HAVE
$10,000,147.16.

08:14.995 --> 08:19.665
- HUH?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.540
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A MISTAKE.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.569
- NOT NECESSARILY.

08:22.603 --> 08:26.113
IT IS AN INTEREST-BEARING
ACCOUNT.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.579
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.908
- ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.293
[chuckles]

08:42.322 --> 08:43.962
- LESBIAN BED DEATH?

08:43.991 --> 08:45.691
WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT
IS THAT?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.086
- THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING TO IT.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.657
I MEAN, WE KNOW AT LEAST
THREE OTHER COUPLES

08:48.696 --> 08:50.096
WHO HAVE STOPPED HAVING SEX.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.100
- EVERY COUPLE GOES THROUGH
HOT AND COLD SPELLS.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.703
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
TOGETHER?

08:54.735 --> 08:55.795
- SEVEN YEARS.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.836
- I'D CONSIDER YOURSELVES
LUCKY.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.311
LISTEN, I MAY NOT BE
AN AUTHORITY

08:59.339 --> 09:01.109
ON LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.641
IN FACT, I MEAN,
I TRY TO AVOID THEM.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.847
BUT I DO KNOW A THING
OR TWO ABOUT SEX,

09:05.879 --> 09:07.779
AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.745
YOUR BATTERY ISN'T DEAD,
IT JUST NEEDS RECHARGING.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.654
WHAT YOU NEED
IS TO SHAKE THINGS UP.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.917
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
BE SPONTANEOUS.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.956
- SPONTANEOUS.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.161
- YEAH.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.603
A COUPLE OF FUCKABLE BABES
LIKE YOU?

09:23.631 --> 09:26.801
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEM.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.251
- I FOUND THIS GAY B & B
FIVE MINUTES FROM SUGARBUSH.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.622
- SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY LESBIAN.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.122
- IT'S THE BEST SNOWBOARDING
IN VERMONT.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.993
- UH-HUH.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.321
- THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT
WE'VE EVER GONE AWAY TOGETHER.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.727
- IS THAT SUCH A GOOD IDEA,

09:51.759 --> 09:53.629
WITH YOUR COMPANY BEING
TAKEN OVER?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.631
- THEY NEED ME
MORE THAN I NEED THEM.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.973
- GUESS YOU'VE GOT
BIGGER BALLS THAN I DO.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.768
- WAS IT EVER A QUESTION?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.741
- WHAT'LL IT BE, BOYS?
DRINKS ARE ON ME.

10:03.771 --> 10:04.841
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

10:04.872 --> 10:06.972
WITH THE 100 BUCKS
I GAVE YOU?

10:07.007 --> 10:10.737
- I, UH, WON'T BE NEEDING ANY
FURTHER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.652
- SOMEBODY
ACCIDENTALLY DEPOSITED

10:14.682 --> 10:18.322
$10 MILLION IN HIS ACCOUNT.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.391
- FUCK!

10:21.421 --> 10:24.021
- I HOPE YOU DIDN'T TOUCH
ANY OF IT.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.857
- JUST A MEASLY 300.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.264
- WHAT?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.425
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.973
YOU COMMITTED BANK FRAUD.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.169
THAT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.270
- OH--OH, MY GOD.
- I WARNED YOU.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.943
- OH, MY GOD,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.112
- TOMORROW YOU'RE GONNA
GO BACK TO THE BANK,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.640
YOU'RE GONNA RETURN
EVERY CENT.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.879
- UH, DO YOU MIND IF
I BORROW BACK THAT 100?

10:48.916 --> 10:51.846
THERE WAS THIS
FABULOUS GUCCI BELT.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.808
- AH.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.039
GARDNER VANCE.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.043
- BRIAN KINNEY.
- SIT.

11:25.052 --> 11:28.322
RYDER TELLS ME THAT YOU'RE
THE BEST ACCOUNT EXEC HE'S GOT.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.015
- HE'S RIGHT.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.228
- WHICH IS WHY I FIRED
EVERYONE ELSE.

11:33.260 --> 11:37.930
- I'VE ALWAYS HATED THOSE LONG
LINES AT THE WATER COOLER.

11:37.965 --> 11:42.065
- HE ALSO TELLS ME
THAT YOU ARE ARROGANT,

11:42.102 --> 11:46.442
WILLFUL, AND, UM,
INSUBORDINATE.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.778
- I'LL TRY MY BEST TO LIVE UP
TO MY REPUTATION.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.051
- WHY DON'T YOU START
BY TELLING ME

11:52.079 --> 11:54.349
WHY I SHOULDN'T FIRE YOU TOO?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.152
- FOR ONE THING,

12:00.187 --> 12:03.417
I KNOW MORE ABOUT
THIS COMPANY THAN YOU DO.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.956
FOR ANOTHER, I HAVE THE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLIENTS.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.063
IF I GO, THEY GO.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.525
AND FINALLY, WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA GET MORE OUT OF ME

12:10.563 --> 12:15.873
THAN SOME TALENTLESS TOADY
YOU BRING IN FOR HALF THE PRICE.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.403
- BEFORE I ACQUIRED THIS FIRM,

12:17.437 --> 12:20.267
I LEARNED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT--
EVERYTHING.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.207
I ALSO CONTACTED EVERY ONE
OF YOUR CLIENTS,

12:23.243 --> 12:27.453
AND THEY AGREED TO STAY,
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.850
WITH REGARD TO
MY HIRING SOME "TOADY,"

12:30.884 --> 12:33.294
AT LEAST THEY GIVE ME THE ONE
THING I DOUBT YOU EVER WILL--

12:33.320 --> 12:34.350
THEIR LOYALTY.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.387
SO ARE THERE
ANY OTHER REASONS

12:36.423 --> 12:39.063
WHY I SHOULDN'T
FIRE YOU TOO?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.925
- I CAN'T THINK OF ONE.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.236
- YOU'VE GOT A WEEK.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.369
PROVE TO ME
THAT YOU'RE WORTH IT.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.476
- THAT LONG?

12:55.508 --> 12:57.538
- OH, BY THE WAY,

12:57.577 --> 13:01.407
RUMOR HAS IT THAT YOU'RE GAY.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.948
- THE RUMOR'S RIGHT.

13:03.984 --> 13:08.294
BUT UNLESS I'M FUCKING YOU,
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.562
- THERE'S BEEN
A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.861
- VERY SLIGHT.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.963
- TINY.
ITSY-BITSY-WEENSY.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.595
- YEAH, IT SEEMS
MR. HONEYCUTT INADVERTENTLY

13:17.630 --> 13:19.470
WITHDREW FUNDS
THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO HIM.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.899
- BUT, UH, HERE'S THE MONEY,
ALL CRISP AND NEW.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.365
IT'S LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.913
- WAIT RIGHT THERE.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.040
- OH MY GOD.
THEY'RE GONNA ARREST ME.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.106
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST CALM DOWN.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.553
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
- YOU'RE GONNA PLAY DUMB.

13:32.579 --> 13:33.979
- I CAN DO THAT.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.324
- YOU'RE GONNA SAY
YOU WITHDREW THE MONEY,

13:35.348 --> 13:36.578
NEVER REALIZING
IT WASN'T YOURS,

13:36.616 --> 13:38.246
WHICH IS WHY YOU'VE
COME TO RETURN IT.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.145
- THAT'S PERFECT.
THAT'S PERFECT.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.387
THEY'RE SURE
TO BELIEVE ME.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.391
- BUT IF THEY DON'T, TRY FOR
A CELL WITH SOUTHERN EXPOSURE.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.434
- WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS MR. HONEYCUTT?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.429
- I-I-I--

13:48.461 --> 13:49.461
- HE IS.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.926
- PLEASE COME WITH ME.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.865
- I DID IT.
I STOLE THE MONEY.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.242
I'M GUILTY.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.139
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.111
[sobbing]

14:00.140 --> 14:02.010
- IT WAS A MISTAKE.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.182
- OH, IT WAS NO MISTAKE.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.051
THE MONEY WAS CORRECTLY
DEPOSITED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.980
ALL $10 MILLION OF IT.

14:12.385 --> 14:17.385
- I NEED TO, UH,
CONSULT WITH MY ACCOUNTANT.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.964
WHAT EXACTLY DID HE MEAN
BY THAT?

14:25.298 --> 14:27.598
- WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

14:27.634 --> 14:30.504
- THE MONEY WAS LEFT TO YOU
BY GEORGE SCHICKEL.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.507
- GEORGE?

14:32.539 --> 14:35.879
- HE ALSO WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.455
- FIND ANYTHING?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.658
- GARDNER VANCE, 41,

14:50.690 --> 14:52.330
GRADUATED HARVARD
BUSINESS SCHOOL,

14:52.359 --> 14:55.599
STARTED AS A COPYWRITER

14:55.628 --> 14:59.028
THEN JUNIOR AD EXEC AT I & R
IN CHICAGO,

14:59.066 --> 15:02.296
PARTNER AT W.J. IN L.A.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.465
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

15:03.503 --> 15:04.643
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

15:04.671 --> 15:07.141
- UH, MOSTLY THE SAME AS YOU,

15:07.174 --> 15:09.484
PLUS A FEATURE ARTICLE
THEY DID ON HIM

15:09.509 --> 15:13.349
IN ONE OF THE CHICAGO PAPERS.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.680
- DIVORCED TWICE.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.184
BOXING FANATIC.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.086
WOW!
STRAIGHT GUYS.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.488
- WELL, THERE'S AN INTERESTING
QUOTE THOUGH.

15:19.519 --> 15:23.019
I CIRCLED IT.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.286
- "WHEN ASKED IF THERE WAS
AN ACCOUNT HE'D NEVER BEEN

15:25.325 --> 15:27.355
"ABLE TO LAND VANCE SAID,

15:27.394 --> 15:31.604
'YEAH, BROWN ATHLETICS.'"

15:40.340 --> 15:41.710
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:41.741 --> 15:44.041
- TO SEE A FEW
OF MY HOTTEST TRICKS.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.647
- YOU'RE GOING
TO THE BATHS NOW?

15:45.678 --> 15:48.648
YOU'RE GONNA FUCK US BOTH
OUT OF A JOB.

15:50.483 --> 15:54.223
- THIS IS THE FILTHIEST,

15:54.254 --> 15:58.164
THE SLEAZIEST, MOST DISGUSTING
MOTEL ROOM I'VE EVER SEEN.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.161
- YOU WERE EXPECTING
THE RITZ-CARLTON?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.734
- UH-HUH.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.373
- WHAT, HEY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.468
- HOME.
- BUT WE JUST WALKED IN.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.200
- AND NOW WE'RE
JUST WALKING OUT.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.436
- BUT WE ALREADY PAID.
- BY THE HOUR.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.741
WHAT KIND OF MOTEL
HAS HOURLY RATES?

16:13.773 --> 16:16.013
- THE KIND WHERE
YOU SNEAK AWAY

16:16.043 --> 16:17.543
FOR A QUICKIE
WITH SOME CHICKIE

16:17.577 --> 16:20.107
AND HOPE YOUR WIFE
DOESN'T FIND OUT.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.491
TAKE OFF YOUR COAT.
STAY A WHILE.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.659
- [groans]

16:32.325 --> 16:35.095
BUT THERE ARE STAINS
ON THE BEDSPREAD.

16:35.128 --> 16:38.228
AND HOLES IN THE CARPET,
AND IT SMELLS.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.625
- WHEW, I KNOW.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.637
SLEAZY, SEXY,
SPONTANEOUS.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.205
- CAN'T WE
BE SPONTANEOUS SOME--

16:50.243 --> 16:52.713
SOMEPLACE ELSE LIKE WHERE
THEY CHANGE THE SHEETS,

16:52.745 --> 16:56.045
AND HAVE ROOM SERVICE?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.453
- THIS SAYS THEY HAVE
A COMPLETE LINE OF SEX TOYS,

16:58.485 --> 17:02.415
INCLUDING 31 FLAVORS OF
LUBRICANT AT THE FRONT DESK.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.815
TAKE YOUR PICK.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.256
[both chuckle]

17:14.666 --> 17:16.797
COME ON.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.485
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.410
[muffled pounding]

17:52.439 --> 17:53.439
[muffled moaning]

17:53.473 --> 17:56.413
- JESUS CHRIST!

17:56.443 --> 17:59.653
- HARDER, HARDER.
HARDER, HARDER.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.649
[moaning]

18:00.680 --> 18:02.380
- I GOTTA CALL THE MANAGER.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.615
- IT'S NOT THE RITZ-CARLTON.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.522
WHY DON'T WE PUT THE TV ON?

18:07.554 --> 18:10.224
MAYBE IT'LL DROWN THEM OUT.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.464
- WHAT ELSE IS ON?

18:14.494 --> 18:16.564
UGH.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.866
- [indistinct]

18:19.899 --> 18:21.329
- NO, IT'S NOT.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.898
- THOSE THINGS AREN'T REAL,
ARE THEY?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.866
- I HOPE NOT.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.575
- [indistinct]

18:28.608 --> 18:29.578
- WOW.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.439
- [moaning]

18:31.478 --> 18:33.348
- INVENTED IN BEIJING,
AS THE CHINESE...

18:33.380 --> 18:36.580
- OH! IT'S MY FAVORITE
COOKING SHOW.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.846
HE'S PREPARING
MANDARIN DUCK.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.215
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.394
- THIS IS AN AIR PUMP.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.422
IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA PUMP
AIR INTO IT,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.457
SEPARATES THE SKIN
FROM THE MEAT,

18:46.493 --> 18:48.263
AND THAT'S THE SECRET
OF RENDERING OFF THE FAT.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.755
ONCE IT'S SEPARATED...

18:49.796 --> 18:51.796
- HEY, EMMETT.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.601
- HI, GEORGE.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.604
- I MISS YOU.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.767
I MISS YOU TOO.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.606
- NOW YOU MUSTN'T CRY.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.183
- I'LL TRY NOT TO.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.212
- LET ME SEE YOU SMILE NOW.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.847
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

19:09.882 --> 19:14.322
- EMMETT, NOW COME ON.
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.194
THAT'S BETTER.

19:16.223 --> 19:19.593
WELL, DID YOU RECEIVE
MY LITTLE GIFT?

19:19.626 --> 19:21.556
- "LITTLE"?

19:21.594 --> 19:23.234
GOD, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.263
- NEITHER COULD WE.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.267
- SEE, YOU--YOU ALWAYS SAY,

19:26.299 --> 19:27.799
"FUCK 'EM ALL."

19:27.834 --> 19:32.244
WELL, TO DO THAT YOU'VE GOT
TO HAVE "FUCK 'EM ALL" MONEY.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.442
- WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH IT?

19:35.475 --> 19:36.635
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.746
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.578
- YOU MADE ME HAPPY.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.624
- YOU TOO.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.750
MORE THAN YOU'LL KNOW.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.685
- 10 MIL'S A PRETTY
CLEAR INDICATION.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.891
- WELL, I--

19:50.923 --> 19:53.433
I GUESS THIS IS IT.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.430
YOU'RE OFF ON YOUR ADVENTURE.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.432
I'M OFF ON MINE.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.721
- I NEED THESE IN THREE HOURS.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.726
- I'M NOT FOTOMAT.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.999
I'LL TRY.

20:29.028 --> 20:33.598
*

20:33.633 --> 20:34.973

DIP IN HERE.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.679

20:43.710 --> 20:45.310
THANK YOU.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.375
- * WHAT CAN YOU SEE
WITH YOUR NAKED EYE *

20:47.414 --> 20:50.324
* GIVE ME ONE MORE SHOT

20:50.350 --> 20:52.350
* TO SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE GOT

20:52.385 --> 20:54.815
- GOOD.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.524

20:57.557 --> 20:58.827
- NICE, GUYS.

20:58.858 --> 20:59.828

YES, PERFECT.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.904
*

21:07.534 --> 21:08.504
YEAH, GOOD.

21:08.535 --> 21:10.465
- GOT YOUR AIRLINE TICKET.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.913
I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE NEEDING IT.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.780
CALLED BROWN'S OFFICE.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.778
THEY SAID HE DOESN'T ACCEPT
UNSOLICITED PITCHES.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.981
- YEAH, YEAH, GOOD.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.553
- DO YOU WANT ME TO CANCEL?

21:27.354 --> 21:28.624
- TA-DA.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.485
- OH, EMMETT!

21:30.523 --> 21:31.963
[laughing]

21:31.991 --> 21:35.601
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.898
- GOD, PEOPLE DON'T GET
THEIR FRIENDS A CAR.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.770
- UNLESS YOU'RE
A GAME SHOW HOST.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.029
- OH, IT'S NOT JUST A CAR.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.937
IT'S A SUBARU SUV.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.369
- [cheering]

21:45.405 --> 21:47.535
- I READ IN A RECENT SURVEY,

21:47.574 --> 21:48.914
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE CHOICE
AMONG LESBIANS.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.981
I'M SURE MR. SUBARU
WOULD BE THRILLED.

21:53.145 --> 21:57.015
- UM, JUSTIN,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.389
- A TRIP TO ITALY?

21:58.418 --> 21:59.348
- YEAH.

21:59.386 --> 22:02.616
GEORGE AND I WERE PLANNING,
BUT NEVER MIND.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.385
YOU'RE GOING, AS ARTISTS
HAVE FOR CENTURIES,

22:05.425 --> 22:08.085
TO THE ETERNAL CITY,
TO FLORENCE, TO VENICE.

22:08.127 --> 22:11.357
IT IS THERE THAT YOU WILL
DISCOVER YOUR SOUL.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.968
- AND SEE LOTS OF
STATUES OF NAKED MEN TOO.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.770
- THANKS, EM.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.143
- AND WHEN YOU AND BRIAN
ARE IN MILAN,

22:18.170 --> 22:20.440
HE CAN USE THIS.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.713
IT'S A GIFT CERTIFICATE

22:21.741 --> 22:23.841
TO ARMANI FOR
THE FALL COLLECTION.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.446
- OH, HE'LL LOVE A NEW SUIT.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.878
- THE ENTIRE COLLECTION.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.553
[laughter]

22:28.581 --> 22:29.981
HE'LL NEVER WONDER
WHAT TO WEAR AGAIN.

22:30.016 --> 22:30.976
[laughter]

22:31.017 --> 22:33.117
AND, DEBBIE,

22:33.152 --> 22:35.862
FOR YOU.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.988
- OH SHIT,
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.064
NO.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.461
- OH MY GOD.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.463
- OH, MA.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.025
- OH.
- WOW.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.833
- NO, EMMETT.
NO. I COULDN'T.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.125
- YEAH!

22:47.166 --> 22:50.496
NOW WHEN YOU ARE
SLINGING THAT HASH,

22:50.537 --> 22:55.007
EVERYONE WILL THINK
YOU'RE A PRINCESS.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.441
- THANK YOU.

22:57.477 --> 23:01.807
MICHAEL.
[chuckles]

23:05.918 --> 23:08.818
- JESUS, EM.

23:08.855 --> 23:11.585
HE PAID THE MORTGAGE
ON MY COMIC BOOK STORE

23:11.624 --> 23:13.694
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

23:13.726 --> 23:14.856
- OH, HONEY.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.764
- YOU JUST CHANGED MY LIFE.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.696
[laughter]

23:19.732 --> 23:24.542
- OH, GUESS THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE BAG FOR ME.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.571
- HMM.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.965
[mumbling]

23:27.006 --> 23:27.966
OH!

23:28.007 --> 23:30.537
both: OHH!

23:30.577 --> 23:32.107
- THE ONE PRESENT
I REALLY WANTED TO GET YOU,

23:32.144 --> 23:33.714
I COULDN'T.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.716
SOMEONE WONDERFUL
TO SPEND YOUR LIFE WITH.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.788
- AH, WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

23:45.725 --> 23:49.455
LIFETIME ORCHESTRA SEAT
AT THE OPERA.

23:49.496 --> 23:50.956
- TWO LIFETIME SEATS,

23:50.997 --> 23:54.467
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL
FIND THAT SOMEONE.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.541
- THANK YOU.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.577
- WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF,
EMMETT?

24:02.609 --> 24:04.709
- I HOPE YOU GOT YOURSELF
SOMETHING.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.214
- OH, NO. NO.

24:06.245 --> 24:09.515
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO GIVE
THAN TO RECEIVE.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.819
EXCEPT IN BED.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.950
[laughter]

24:11.984 --> 24:14.924
HOWEVER, THERE WAS
A LITTLE SOMETHING

24:14.954 --> 24:16.824
THAT DID CATCH MY EYE.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.086
- HERE WE GO.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.694
- NOW'S WHEN I START TO WORRY.

24:19.726 --> 24:22.996
- GEORGE WANTED IT TO BE
"FUCK 'EM ALL" MONEY.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.569
[cheering]

24:25.598 --> 24:28.638
WELL, GEORGIE,
THEY'LL HEAR ME IN THIS.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.068
HA HA!

24:30.102 --> 24:32.002
[all oohing]

24:32.038 --> 24:34.738
- LIBERACE.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.717
- [startled gasp]

24:45.752 --> 24:46.892
HEY.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.589
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO THE KITCHEN

24:49.622 --> 24:51.222
TO MAKE MYSELF A SANDWICH.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.757
- COME SHARE MINE.
COME ON.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.126
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE HERE.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.725
I FIGURED YOU'D BE OUT PAINTING
THE TOWN RED OR...

25:01.768 --> 25:05.298
WHATEVER COLOR THEY PAINT
TOWNS THESE DAYS.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.537
- ALL THE HOT GALS ARE
HOME WITH THEIR WIVES,

25:07.574 --> 25:09.684
GETTING IT ON.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.079
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

25:11.110 --> 25:13.280
- WE TRIED GOING TO A MOTEL.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.212
- NO SHIT!

25:15.247 --> 25:16.777
DID THEY HEAR YOU SCREAMING
THROUGH THE WALLS?

25:16.816 --> 25:18.276
- THAT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.147
WE WERE THE ONES
WATCHING THE COOKING SHOW.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.687
- WELL, IF I'D BEEN THERE, I'D
HAVE PINNED YOU BOTH TO THE BED

25:22.722 --> 25:23.892
AND DONE THE DOZEN-DOZEN--

25:23.923 --> 25:26.133
12 ORGASMS IN
12 DIFFERENT POSITIONS.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.858
- [coughs]

25:27.894 --> 25:29.864
- YOU OKAY?

25:29.896 --> 25:31.126
- JUST WENT DOWN
THE WRONG WAY.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.203
- CHRIST, YOU'RE TIGHT.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.202
HONEY, YOU NEED TO LOOSEN UP.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.674
LIE DOWN.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.173
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.974
- NO, NO, I'M JUST GONNA
RUB YOUR SHOULDERS.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.906
MM-HMM.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.541
COME ON. COME ON.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.723
I'LL GET ALL
THE STRESS WORKED OUT.

25:49.749 --> 25:53.289
AND THEN YOU AND THE MISSUS
CAN SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.058
MMM.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.959
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.931
SHIATSU.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.930
- HMM.
MM-HMM.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.632
- OR EVEN BETTER,

26:05.665 --> 26:07.825
TANTRIC.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.811
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A DEEP RECTAL MASSAGE?

26:14.841 --> 26:16.841
- NOT RECENTLY.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.876
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH TENSION

26:18.911 --> 26:22.721
PEOPLE CARRY
IN THEIR SPHINCTERS.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.879
[both chuckle]

26:27.987 --> 26:29.757
SHH.

26:29.789 --> 26:33.159
[laughter]

26:33.192 --> 26:34.932
- EMMETT GOT EVERYONE
THE COOLEST STUFF.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.361
HE GOT CARS, TRIPS.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.095
HE EVEN GAVE DEBBIE
A DIAMOND BRACELET.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.230
- I REALLY HAVE
TO HAND IT TO HIM.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.636
HE MUST HAVE GIVEN GEORGE
ONE HELL OF A BLOW JOB.

26:42.669 --> 26:43.999
HAVE YOU SEEN MY PRADA TIE?

26:44.036 --> 26:44.996
- FUCK THE TIE.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.807
HE GOT YOU THE ENTIRE
ARMANI FALL COLLECTION.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.380
- YEAH, WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO WEAR UNTIL THEN?

26:49.408 --> 26:51.708
- HE GOT ME A TRIP TO ITALY

26:51.744 --> 26:53.114
TO SEE ALL THE MASTERS.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.375
- YEAH, I HEARD THEY HAVE
A BIG S&M SCENE THERE.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.215
- WHY ARE YOU BRINGING A TIE
TO GO SNOWBOARDING?

26:59.251 --> 27:02.321
- I'M NOT GOING SNOWBOARDING.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.994
I'M GOING TO CHICAGO.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.793
- CHICAGO?

27:05.825 --> 27:07.125
WHAT THE HELL'S IN CHICAGO?

27:07.159 --> 27:09.129
- MY NEW ACCOUNT.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.101
- BUT WE'RE GOING
TO VERMONT TOMORROW.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.201
- SOME OTHER TIME.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.842
- COME ON, YOU PROMISED.

27:16.869 --> 27:17.939
- IT'S BUSINESS.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.410
- FUCK BUSINESS!

27:19.438 --> 27:23.738
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHO YOU'RE FUCKING.

27:23.776 --> 27:24.976
IT'S BUSINESS.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.011
IT'S MY BUSINESS.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.276
IT PAYS FOR THIS LOFT.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.775
IT PAYS FOR SNOWBOARDING
IN VERMONT.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.688
IT PAYS FOR THE PITTSBURGH
INSTITUTE OF FINE ARTS.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.991
NOW, IF I DON'T
GET ON THAT PLANE,

27:37.023 --> 27:39.293
I'M GOING TO BE
COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT

27:39.325 --> 27:41.985
IN MY FUCKING ARMANI
FALL COLLECTION.

28:02.081 --> 28:06.051
- HEY, SWEETS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:06.085 --> 28:08.755
- LOOKS GREAT.

28:08.788 --> 28:11.058
- LINDSAY'S ALL HEPPED TOO.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.790
- YOU'VE DONE AN AMAZING JOB.

28:13.826 --> 28:14.826
- THANKS.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.931
- WHOA, CAREFUL.

28:17.964 --> 28:21.474
SHE AND I ARE
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.440
- ANYTHING FOR YOU GUYS,
YOU KNOW THAT.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.199
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT FAIR

28:25.237 --> 28:27.867
ASKING YOU TO DO ALL THIS
BY YOURSELF.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.277
- I'M LOVING IT.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.408
- NO, REALLY, I MEAN,
IT'S TOO BIG A JOB.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.183
WE CAN FIND A CARPENTER
OR A HANDYMAN

28:34.213 --> 28:36.883
TO COME IN AND FINISH IT UP.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.986
- SUGAR, THERE'S
NO HANDYMAN OR WOMAN

28:39.018 --> 28:40.188
HANDIER THAN ME.

28:40.219 --> 28:44.059
- I KNOW ALL ABOUT
YOUR HANDIWORK.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.330
LIKE THE JOB YOU WERE DOING
ON LINDSAY LAST NIGHT.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.898
- THAT WAS JUST A FRIENDLY
LITTLE MASSAGE.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.428
- [scoffs]

28:50.462 --> 28:53.502
IT LOOKED MORE THAN
A LITTLE FRIENDLY TO ME.

28:53.532 --> 28:57.442
- JESUS, WHAT'S WITH
THE JEALOUS WIFE ROUTINE?

28:57.469 --> 28:59.369
- I MASSAGE HER AND
SHE FUCKING FALLS ASLEEP.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.135
YOU RUB HER AND SHE PURRS.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.983
- OH, SO NOW I'M TO BLAME
FOR YOUR LESBIAN BED DEATH.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.510
- ALL I KNOW IS EVERYTHING
WAS FINE BEFORE YOU MOVED IN.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.975
- WHO THE HELL INVITED ME?

29:08.014 --> 29:10.124
- I DID.

29:10.149 --> 29:13.289
AND NOW I'M ASKING YOU
TO LEAVE.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.091
- YOU WANT SOME?

29:21.127 --> 29:22.857
- NOT HUNGRY.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.955
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,
STARVE YOURSELF TO DEATH?

29:24.997 --> 29:26.397
- YOU SOUND JUST LIKE DEB.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.102
- I WONDER HOW THAT HAPPENED.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.995
COME ON, EAT.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.138
YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY SECRET FANTASY?

29:34.173 --> 29:36.013
- I DON'T GENERALLY LIKE
DISCUSSING KINK

29:36.042 --> 29:37.042
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

29:37.076 --> 29:40.276
- TO SEE RAGE
ON A CEREAL BOX,

29:40.312 --> 29:41.982
PREFERABLY FROOT LOOPS.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.554
A LITTLE ACTION FIGURE INSIDE.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.052
- COLLECT ALL THREE.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.594
- COULD HAPPEN.
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.858
- EXCEPT BRIAN AND I ACTUALLY
SPENDING ANY TIME TOGETHER.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.519
- I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE
RATHER GONE WITH YOU.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.087
HE HAD NO CHOICE.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.555
- DO YOU ALWAYS DEFEND HIM?

29:54.593 --> 29:57.133
- LOOK, IF HE DOESN'T MAKE IT
NOW, HE NEVER WILL.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.363
- HE'S ALREADY MADE IT.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.497
HE HAS MONEY, SUCCESS,
A KILLER LOFT.

30:00.532 --> 30:01.532
WHAT ELSE DOES HE WANT?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.067
- TO BE THE BEST.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.302
IF HE GETS THIS ACCOUNT,
HE'LL BE A STAR.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.137
AND IF HE DOESN'T,
HE'S OUT OF A JOB.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.943
IT WON'T BE THAT EASY
STARTING OVER AT A NEW FIRM.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.136
YOU KNOW, WITH ALL
THESE NEW GUYS,

30:12.178 --> 30:14.048
YOUNGER GUYS,
COMING UP ALL THE TIME.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.150
- SO WHAT ABOUT ME?

30:16.182 --> 30:20.552
WHERE DO I FIT IN?

30:20.586 --> 30:25.586
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.934
I WANT A BOYFRIEND WHO ONLY
WANTS TO BE WITH ME,

30:28.961 --> 30:32.261
WHO WANTS TO STAY HOME
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.928
WHO AT LEAST GETS JEALOUS WHEN
SOME OTHER GUY'S SUCKING MY DICK

30:34.967 --> 30:36.137
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.208
- THAT'S NOT BRIAN.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.508
IT NEVER WILL BE.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.176
- I'M SORRY, MR. KINNEY,

30:46.212 --> 30:47.912
BUT WE LEFT WORD
WITH YOUR ASSISTANT

30:47.947 --> 30:50.077
THAT MR. BROWN WASN'T INTERESTED
IN MEETING WITH YOU.

30:50.116 --> 30:53.146
- TELL HIM I FLEW ALL THE WAY
FROM PITTSBURGH JUST TO SEE HIM.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.185
- UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S IN
A CLOSED- DOOR MEETING

30:55.221 --> 30:56.491
AND CAN'T BE DISTURBED.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.092
- I'LL WAIT.

30:58.124 --> 31:02.494
- HIS DAY IS BOOKED SOLID.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.498
- YOU KNOW, I'M SURE IF HE
SAW MY PRESENTATION--

31:04.530 --> 31:06.630
- LOOK, I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.895
- NO, YOU'RE WASTING HIS TIME,

31:08.935 --> 31:11.265
BECAUSE THE SOONER
YOU GET ME IN TO SEE HIM,

31:11.303 --> 31:14.543
THE SOONER I CAN
SHOW HIM THESE.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.547
- INTERESTING.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.581
- I CAN SEE YOU'RE
IMPRESSED.

31:25.617 --> 31:30.017
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
A COPY FOR YOURSELF.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.673
- [grunting]

31:39.698 --> 31:42.098
MR. BROWN...UH...

31:42.134 --> 31:43.204
EATS LUNCH...

31:43.235 --> 31:46.265
HARVARD CLUB.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.629
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

32:11.663 --> 32:13.673
- BRIAN KINNEY,
VANGUARD ADVERTISING.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.299
YOUR ASSISTANT
SAID I'D FIND YOU HERE.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.344
- I TOLD HIM TO TELL YOU
I WASN'T INTERESTED.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.970
- REALLY.
WONDER WHAT GOT INTO HIM.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.977
- HERMAN, WILL YOU KINDLY
SHOW THIS GENTLEMAN OUT?

32:23.009 --> 32:26.079
- HERMAN, WOULD YOU KINDLY
BRING US A BOTTLE OF DOM?

32:26.112 --> 32:28.352
ON VANGUARD, OF COURSE.
WE'RE CELEBRATING,

32:28.380 --> 32:31.950
BROWN ATHLETICS'
NEW AD CAMPAIGN.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.288
- IF YOU'RE HERE TO CONVINCE ME
TO BE MORE HIP,

32:38.324 --> 32:39.594
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.525
I'LL BE DAMNED IF I MAKE
A PAIR OF SNEAKERS

32:41.560 --> 32:42.760
THAT LIGHT UP
WHEN YOU BOUNCE.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.204
- LEAVE TRENDINESS
TO THE OTHER GUYS.

32:45.231 --> 32:49.101
WHAT YOU SELL IS GOOD OLD
AMERICAN TRADITION,

32:49.135 --> 32:50.735
BUT YOU NEED SOMETHING

32:50.769 --> 32:53.209
WITH MORE HEAT.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.109
- YOUNG MAN,
THERE IS NO HEAT

32:55.141 --> 32:56.681
IN BASEBALL CAPS
AND WINDBREAKERS.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.338
- YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S NOT.

32:58.377 --> 33:02.207
BUT IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE
PEOPLE THINK THAT THERE IS.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.087
- "THE ONE THING TO WEAR".

33:10.122 --> 33:12.362
- WE RUN THESE IN ALL
THE TOP-END MAGAZINES.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.491
VANITY FAIR, ESQUIRE, GQ.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.696
WE APPEAL TO WOMEN BECAUSE
THEY DO MOST OF THE SPENDING,

33:16.728 --> 33:22.028
AND TO THE NEW GAY MARKET.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.109

TOO TIRING, TOO COLD.

34:08.614 --> 34:09.524

BUT, UM, BUT THEN I
REALIZED I DON'T NEED TO BUY

34:14.585 --> 34:15.416
ON SALE ANYMORE.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.164
AND IT ALL SUDDENLY SEEMED
SO EMPTY.

VAST SUMS OF MONEY.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.094

RESPONSIBILITY.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.708
I MEAN, I BOUGHT PRESENTS
FOR EVERYONE

34:33.739 --> 34:36.478
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE PERSON
WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE.

34:36.507 --> 34:39.108
GEORGE.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.445
- EM, GEORGE IS DEAD.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.449

YOU KNOW, A CAR OR A WATCH,
BUT, UH...

34:46.518 --> 34:48.518
I CAN HONOR HIS MEMORY.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.824
- WELL, HE'S ALREADY GOT LOTS
OF THINGS TO HONOR HIS MEMORY.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.786

34:52.824 --> 34:54.864
- I WAS THINKING, UH,
MORE ALONG THE LINES

34:54.893 --> 35:00.403

HOME FOR GAY AND LESBIAN YOUTH.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.844
- GEORGE SURE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING

35:04.870 --> 35:08.370
WHEN HE GAVE THAT MONEY

35:10.509 --> 35:11.839
HELLO.

- I'M EMMETT HONEYCUTT,

35:16.748 --> 35:18.478
BUT I'M NOT ON THE MENU.

35:18.517 --> 35:21.517
- THIS IS FOR YOU.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.434
- WHAT IS IT?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.758

35:31.797 --> 35:34.827
YADA-YADA
"TO INFORM YOU THAT..."

35:34.866 --> 35:36.636
YADA-YADA--

35:36.668 --> 35:39.708
- YADA-YADA WHAT?

35:39.738 --> 35:42.568
- THE SCHICKEL FAMILY

35:42.608 --> 35:47.178
IS CONTESTING EMMETT'S
INHERITANCE.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.553
- BUT...

35:49.581 --> 35:51.651
THEY CAN'T DO THAT.
HE LEFT IT TO ME.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.923
- WELL, APPARENTLY THEY THINK
HE SHOULD'VE LEFT IT TO THEM.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.322
THEY'VE FROZEN YOUR ACCOUNT.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.285
- WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

35:59.325 --> 36:00.555
- IT MEANS MAYBE
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

36:00.592 --> 36:02.762
PASSED UP THOSE SALES
QUITE SO QUICKLY.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.674
- YOU TOLD HER TO LEAVE
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME?

36:07.699 --> 36:09.539
- YOU NEVER WANTED HER HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.668
- WELL, I LIKE THAT
SHE'S HERE NOW.

36:10.702 --> 36:11.942
- YEAH, I BET YOU DO.

36:11.970 --> 36:12.870
- SHE'S DOING AN AMAZING JOB.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.874
- AND NOT JUST IN THE ATTIC.
- EXCUSE ME?

36:14.906 --> 36:16.376
- ALL THIS TIME I'M THINKING

36:16.408 --> 36:17.878
THE REASON THAT WE'RE
NOT FEELING VERY SEXUAL

36:17.909 --> 36:19.809
IS BECAUSE WE'RE TOO TIRED,

36:19.845 --> 36:21.405
THAT WE HAVE TOO MUCH
ON OUR MINDS.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.947
I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE
ON YOUR MIND WAS HER.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.281
- WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.746
- OH, GOD,
DON'T LIE TO ME.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.424
I'VE LIVED WITH YOU
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.593
I KNOW YOU.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.621

36:32.658 --> 36:33.758

36:39.598 --> 36:42.598
- ME?
THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

36:42.634 --> 36:43.744
- NOW WHO'S LYING?

36:43.769 --> 36:44.839
- OH...

36:44.870 --> 36:46.940
- THE MINUTE SHE CAME
ZOOMING BACK INTO YOUR LIFE,

36:46.972 --> 36:48.872
YOU COULDN'T WAIT TO JUMP
ON THE BACK OF HER MOTORCYCLE.

36:48.907 --> 36:53.607
- ALL RIGHT,

36:53.645 --> 36:55.945
- YOU KNOW, YOU TWO

TO LEAVE LIKE THIS.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.632
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:43.395 --> 37:46.365
IT'S BULLSHIT.

38:13.492 --> 38:21.432

38:28.139 --> 38:34.609
* SHE'S GOT NEW EYES

38:34.646 --> 38:41.086
