00:24.303 --> 00:26.332
There's juice in the blender.

00:26.367 --> 00:28.744
Jared's gonna say he hates it,
but he has to drink it.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.046
- Juice is not negotiable.
- I understand.

00:31.081 --> 00:33.738
Oh, and I need you to stop
at the farmer's market

00:33.773 --> 00:37.382
to pick up some vegetables.
There's a list on the counter.

00:37.916 --> 00:39.298
The farmer's market.

00:39.333 --> 00:42.457
Why can't we just shop at the
supermarket like everybody else?

00:42.492 --> 00:45.054
Leland, please. Do you want your
children to be like everybody else

00:45.089 --> 00:48.001
and have chemicals and
pesticides and God knows what,

00:48.036 --> 00:50.705
or do you want them to be better
than everybody else?

00:50.740 --> 00:52.188
Better.

00:55.465 --> 00:56.979
Damn!

00:57.227 --> 01:00.560
- What is in there?
- Lighting equipment.

01:00.725 --> 01:03.030
- Well, how much did that cost?
- Oh, don't worry, Leland.

01:03.065 --> 01:04.174
I will pay you back.

01:04.209 --> 01:06.271
That's not the point.
What I meant was that it's...

01:06.316 --> 01:08.642
We-We can't afford lighting equipment!

01:08.677 --> 01:10.359
Move.

01:11.005 --> 01:14.644
If I had a digital camera I wouldn't need
so much lighting equipment.

01:14.679 --> 01:17.202
We cannot afford a new camera!

01:17.237 --> 01:19.549
Karen, I do not want to have another fight!

01:19.584 --> 01:20.957
I would love to have another fight,

01:20.992 --> 01:23.759
because I am sick and tired of this one.

01:30.287 --> 01:33.600
Don't forget about the farmer's market,
and don't pretend...

01:33.635 --> 01:37.242
to forget about the farmer's market.

01:39.770 --> 01:41.868
I will call you later.

01:52.593 --> 01:54.590
And I love you too.

02:01.226 --> 02:04.144
Hi. I'm leaving right now.

02:04.726 --> 02:06.798
Is Sandy there yet?

02:12.706 --> 02:14.401
Tell Jerry I'm bringing my lighting kit.

02:14.436 --> 02:16.649
We'll need about an hour to set up.

02:35.658 --> 02:38.858
MONK Season 2 Epi. 14
Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife

03:40.810 --> 03:42.065
Hey, Monk.!

03:42.100 --> 03:43.290
Captain.

03:44.077 --> 03:46.568
- Happy garbage day!
- Thank you.

03:46.603 --> 03:48.348
What are you doing here?

03:48.383 --> 03:49.785
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.193
I was going to the farmer's market
to buy alfalfa sprouts.

03:52.228 --> 03:53.976
I figured I'd drop that off.

03:54.011 --> 03:56.708
That's your check for the Rutherford case.

03:56.743 --> 03:58.149
Late.

03:58.521 --> 04:00.243
- Who's late?
- Garbage truck.

04:00.278 --> 04:02.884
It's 8:22. They've never been this late.

04:02.919 --> 04:05.486
No, it's 8:15.

04:06.049 --> 04:08.984
Is that the watch that Trudy gave you?

04:09.224 --> 04:14.541
So, you're never gonna know what time
it is for the rest of your life? - Maybe.

04:14.735 --> 04:17.986
You know, Trudy's been gone
for seven years. I...

04:18.021 --> 04:21.226
I think maybe it's time
you think about letting go.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.943
- Letting go?
- Yeah.

04:22.978 --> 04:24.796
You should think about your future.

04:24.831 --> 04:25.959
What future?

04:25.994 --> 04:27.816
- Your future.
- I don't have one.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.092
Yes, you do.

04:29.127 --> 04:30.680
Yes, you do.
And I think that you should...

04:30.715 --> 04:32.549
you should start thinking about
building a life.

04:32.584 --> 04:35.117
You should, uh, get on with it.

04:35.152 --> 04:37.324
Just let it go.

04:37.359 --> 04:39.783
At least buy a new watch.

04:39.818 --> 04:42.201
- Just think about it.
- I'm afraid to.

04:42.236 --> 04:44.490
Here! Here they come.

04:52.505 --> 04:53.789
Hold on. Where's...

04:53.824 --> 04:56.422
- Where's Tully?
- On vacation.

04:56.457 --> 04:59.807
He never said anything to me
about a vacation.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.250
Why would he tell you?

05:01.285 --> 05:03.556
We have a relationship.

05:03.591 --> 05:06.667
He's been collecting
my garbage for years.

05:06.702 --> 05:08.257
Mister, relax, okay?

05:08.292 --> 05:09.575
We know what we're doing.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.940
You know, we taught Tully
the garbage game, okay?

05:11.975 --> 05:14.660
Okay. Yeah, but wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:14.695 --> 05:16.697
You... You have to start from this end.

05:16.732 --> 05:18.937
Tully always starts from this end.

05:18.972 --> 05:21.873
Didn't Tully mention me?

05:21.908 --> 05:24.288
Believe me, I would have remembered.

05:29.233 --> 05:30.323
What's in here?

05:30.358 --> 05:31.267
Water.

05:31.302 --> 05:33.356
You're throwing away water?

05:33.391 --> 05:35.231
Don't ask.

05:36.590 --> 05:37.921
Okay, now... now this one.

05:37.956 --> 05:39.240
Dude, what difference does it make, man?

05:39.275 --> 05:41.112
I mean, it's all going to the same place.

05:41.147 --> 05:42.753
Actually, no.

05:42.788 --> 05:44.736
When you get to the dump, uh,

05:44.771 --> 05:47.858
my bags go in Sector Nine.

05:48.623 --> 05:50.739
Sector Nine?

05:50.774 --> 05:52.900
Tully puts my garbage in Sector Nine,

05:52.935 --> 05:56.052
so... so it's separate.

05:57.093 --> 05:59.645
Right. Sector... Sector Nine.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.517
- You got it, Sector Nine.
- Have a good day.

06:02.552 --> 06:06.112
Hey, God bless you and your work.

06:16.231 --> 06:18.255
Captain, I've been trying to call you.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.979
What's going on?

06:20.330 --> 06:22.003
This morning...

06:22.375 --> 06:26.693
This morning... - For God's sake,
Randy, just say it!

06:26.728 --> 06:28.951
It's Karen.

06:33.082 --> 06:35.979
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.
My wife, Karen, was just brought in.

06:36.014 --> 06:40.123
Captain, I'm Dr. Maulding.
I was on duty when she was admitted.

06:40.158 --> 06:42.495
Um, would you like to come with me?
I have an office upstairs...

06:42.530 --> 06:44.581
No, no. Now. Tell me now.

06:44.616 --> 06:46.195
She has some internal hemorrhaging

06:46.230 --> 06:47.898
and a non-displaced fracture of the skull.

06:47.933 --> 06:49.474
Bottom line. What's the bottom line?

06:49.509 --> 06:51.861
Her vital signs are strong.
They seem to be holding.

06:51.896 --> 06:54.338
If the swelling goes down, we're going
to operate first thing in the morning.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.573
Wh-Who's gonna do that?

06:55.608 --> 06:59.041
- Dr. Schecter and Dr. Foster.
- They're good.

06:59.076 --> 07:02.071
I'm an R. N. I interned
here seven years ago.

07:02.106 --> 07:03.681
She's right.
They're the best we have.

07:03.716 --> 07:04.917
Okay. Could I see her?

07:04.952 --> 07:07.327
In a few minutes. Um, Captain.

07:07.362 --> 07:09.084
We're good at our job.

07:09.119 --> 07:10.453
Let us do it.

07:10.488 --> 07:11.465
Okay. Okay.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.271
- Right, right. I'll call you back.
- What do you got?

07:14.306 --> 07:16.089
Okay, this is what we know...

07:16.124 --> 07:17.738
Sniper on Highway 9.

07:17.773 --> 07:21.355
So far it looks completely random
a thrill killing.

07:21.390 --> 07:23.059
He took out the tow truck driver,

07:23.094 --> 07:25.419
- and the truck spun into the...
- Into Karen!

07:25.454 --> 07:26.633
Who was it?

07:26.668 --> 07:28.889
We don't have him... yet.

07:29.559 --> 07:31.472
- I want everybody.
- You've got them, sir.

07:31.507 --> 07:33.840
Everybody is volunteering.
There's gonna be a task force.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.156
I talked to the commissioner.

07:35.191 --> 07:37.780
- He said whatever you need.
- All right, good.

07:38.566 --> 07:40.655
Monk.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.554
You... - I know.

07:47.589 --> 07:51.067
If I lose her... - I know.

07:51.102 --> 07:53.984
We... Karen... - I know.

07:54.019 --> 07:57.797
- Since... Since we were kids.
- I know.

07:58.451 --> 08:01.259
I know.

08:03.839 --> 08:07.056
Is there anything I can do?

08:07.797 --> 08:10.600
You know what you can do.

08:12.486 --> 08:14.396
The victim's name was Fernandez.

08:14.431 --> 08:18.132
Frank Fernandez, 34, unmarried.
He lives in Oakland.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.230
Witnesses?

08:19.265 --> 08:21.802
We're still knocking on doors. Not yet.

08:21.837 --> 08:23.817
He shot from over there?

08:23.852 --> 08:25.270
Yes.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.578
Any idea where he parked?

08:27.613 --> 08:30.039
We haven't found any tracks.
He could have parked anywhere.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.475
There's a million little side roads
around here. We're still looking.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.643
But why there in the open?

08:33.678 --> 08:35.923
The surrounding area is heavily wooded.

08:35.957 --> 08:38.207
There'd have been more cover.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.866
I don't know.
It's a good question.

08:42.097 --> 08:44.795
Ooh! Hey, you lost?

08:44.830 --> 08:47.580
No. I'm just thinking.

08:47.615 --> 08:49.196
I'm not talking to you.

08:49.231 --> 08:50.532
Don't, Sharona! Don't...

08:50.567 --> 08:52.024
Don't touch the dog, okay?

08:52.059 --> 08:53.292
Just please don't pat the dog.

08:53.327 --> 08:55.120
- Don't touch the dog.
- Well, why?

08:55.155 --> 08:57.843
Okay, if you touch the dog, Sharona,
I'm...

08:57.878 --> 08:59.427
I have to let you go.

08:59.462 --> 09:02.142
You always say you're gonna let me go,
but you never do it.

09:02.177 --> 09:04.186
Don't listen to him.
He doesn't like anybody.

09:04.221 --> 09:06.407
- Come on. Whose doggy are you?
- We recovered the shell.

09:06.442 --> 09:09.436
It's a thirty-aught-six from
a Winchester bolt action.

09:09.471 --> 09:12.424
It's not a sniper's rifle.
He's a hunter.

09:12.459 --> 09:13.651
Look at this.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.635
He crawled through this hole.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.599
Shirt got caught.

09:17.634 --> 09:20.714
He fired from over there
behind the mound.

09:22.464 --> 09:26.339
How did he know the hole was here?

09:26.374 --> 09:28.288
Maybe he cased the area?

09:28.323 --> 09:31.061
Or he lives nearby.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.160
She's gonna want to keep it.
We can't have a dog!

09:35.195 --> 09:37.305
You don't live together.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.799
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:41.077 --> 09:44.249
You want to see something really weird?

09:44.284 --> 09:46.779
No.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.707
Okay.

09:51.743 --> 09:54.284
He wasn't wearing any shoes.

09:54.319 --> 09:55.749
What?

09:55.784 --> 09:58.813
- Watch your step.
- Bare feet?

10:01.367 --> 10:04.833
Why would a sniper... go barefoot?

10:04.868 --> 10:07.039
Especially at 6:00 in the morning.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.473
It's been freezing.

10:08.508 --> 10:11.104
Maybe he was an American Indian?

10:11.389 --> 10:13.830
An American Indian sniper?

10:13.865 --> 10:18.167
Maybe it was an uprising...
against technology.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.394
That doesn't make a lot of sense.

10:21.429 --> 10:23.592
Hardly any, really.

10:23.627 --> 10:27.102
- Oh, "Native American."
- That doesn't help.

10:28.986 --> 10:30.800
Lieutenant Disher...

10:31.263 --> 10:32.683
Really? - Uh-huh.

10:33.114 --> 10:35.349
You're gonna wanna to see this.

10:35.575 --> 10:36.747
Yahhh!

10:37.294 --> 10:38.738
This can't be a coincidence.

10:38.773 --> 10:40.162
What are you talking about?

10:40.197 --> 10:42.434
Frank Fernandez, the truck driver.

10:42.469 --> 10:45.240
They've looked everywhere.
They can't find them.

10:45.275 --> 10:47.528
Can't find what?

10:47.563 --> 10:51.402
His shoes.
He was barefoot too.

11:01.053 --> 11:01.978
Hey.

11:02.576 --> 11:04.030
Hey yourself.

11:04.065 --> 11:06.577
- I brought you some coffee.
- Thanks.

11:06.612 --> 11:08.536
How's Mrs. S.?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.383
She's still unconscious.

11:11.418 --> 11:14.816
- Have you seen her yet?
- Yeah, I've seen her.

11:14.851 --> 11:17.369
I'll feel a whole lot better when
she can see me.

11:17.404 --> 11:18.499
How are the boys doing?

11:18.534 --> 11:20.015
They're scared to death.

11:20.050 --> 11:23.068
They're with my mother,
which is scary enough.

11:23.103 --> 11:24.575
What do you got?

11:24.610 --> 11:26.418
It's coming together.

11:26.716 --> 11:28.700
What does that mean?

11:28.735 --> 11:31.208
The killer and the victim were
both barefoot.

11:31.243 --> 11:34.000
I mean, Monk isn't sure what it means,
but he knows it's important.

11:34.035 --> 11:35.730
What, do you have a suspect?
Do you have a name?

11:35.765 --> 11:39.266
Not yet. The task force has a theory.
They're checking it out.

11:42.307 --> 11:44.245
What?

11:44.469 --> 11:47.257
I'm not supposed to tell you.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.979
They warned me.

11:52.302 --> 11:54.959
You know the local transport
union's on strike. - Yeah?

11:54.994 --> 11:56.861
Harry Bolston, the union boss,

11:56.896 --> 12:00.251
he's made a few threats.
It's getting ugly.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.748
Okay.

12:02.498 --> 12:04.620
The tow truck belonged to a union shop.

12:04.655 --> 12:07.733
The driver was a scab.

12:09.785 --> 12:13.234
It was a union thing?

12:23.833 --> 12:25.821
It's just a theory, sir.

12:25.856 --> 12:29.296
- They're not sure yet.
- Son of a bitch.

12:30.108 --> 12:33.522
- Where are you going?
- Never you mind, son.

12:36.227 --> 12:37.950
Okay, I'll go with you.

12:41.614 --> 12:43.131
No deal, no work!

12:43.166 --> 12:44.996
No deal, no work!

12:45.031 --> 12:47.475
- No deal, no work!
- Who's on the front gate?

12:47.510 --> 12:49.415
Little Tommy and his crew.

12:49.450 --> 12:52.903
Tell him to take pictures of all
the drivers, so we know who they are.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.537
And don't hide the cameras.

12:54.572 --> 12:56.082
I want them to know that we know.

12:56.117 --> 12:57.336
Yes, sir, Mr. Bolston.

12:57.371 --> 13:01.507
If you want, they can do more than
just take pictures.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.931
No. - You're the boss.

13:07.171 --> 13:08.872
No deal, no work!

13:08.907 --> 13:10.585
No deal, no work!

13:10.620 --> 13:12.770
No deal, no work!

13:15.501 --> 13:18.205
Okay. Okay, bye.

13:18.736 --> 13:20.743
That was Disher.
They're on their way.

13:20.778 --> 13:21.978
Why are we even here?

13:22.013 --> 13:24.452
- I want to protect the captain.
- From who?

13:24.487 --> 13:26.509
From himself.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.514
Adrian? No!

13:28.549 --> 13:30.543
You call him "Adrian"?

13:30.578 --> 13:31.797
It seemed to fit.

13:31.832 --> 13:34.130
He's nervous,
and he's always cleaning himself.

13:34.165 --> 13:37.354
- You should be flattered.
- I should be, but I'm not.

13:44.655 --> 13:46.529
Scabs go home!

13:47.686 --> 13:49.147
Scabs!

13:49.431 --> 13:50.447
All right.

13:50.482 --> 13:51.777
Scabs.!

13:52.821 --> 13:54.569
Union! Union!

13:54.604 --> 13:56.707
Scabs go home!

13:56.742 --> 13:58.576
Union!

13:59.827 --> 14:01.799
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm a union girl.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.616
- Since when?
- Since I started working for you.

14:04.651 --> 14:07.567
Scabs go home!

14:08.155 --> 14:09.681
I should start my own shop.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.299
Do it. I'll join you.

14:11.334 --> 14:12.956
You're not allowed.
You're management.

14:12.991 --> 14:14.962
Oh, yeah? Good.
Get rid of the dog.

14:14.997 --> 14:16.766
Will you stop worrying about this?

14:16.801 --> 14:19.059
I got the vet's number off the collar.

14:19.094 --> 14:22.079
They gave me the owner's name,
and I'm gonna drop him off later, okay?

14:22.114 --> 14:23.034
Okay.

14:23.901 --> 14:27.794
I'm gonna miss you.
Gonna miss you, honey.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.159
No work, no deal!
No work, no deal!

14:31.194 --> 14:33.584
- Where is Harry Bolston?
- Captain, please be careful.

14:33.619 --> 14:35.414
Bolston's already sued
the department twice.

14:35.449 --> 14:37.378
I'm just gonna talk to the man, Randy.
That's all.

14:37.413 --> 14:39.442
Captain, I think you're making
a mistake. - Not now, Monk.

14:39.477 --> 14:41.198
I-I don't think the union is involved.

14:41.233 --> 14:43.015
Look, you've been
reading about this strike.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.429
The negotiations are going their way.
Every editorial is behind them.

14:46.464 --> 14:47.825
Why would they do something stupid now?

14:47.860 --> 14:49.768
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It makes sense to me.

14:49.803 --> 14:52.369
Also, the shooter wasn't wearing shoes.

14:52.404 --> 14:55.705
Can you imagine any of these guys
running around barefoot?

14:55.740 --> 14:58.188
- Well, maybe he wasn't thinking straight.
- Maybe you're not.

14:58.223 --> 15:00.097
Look, Monk, you don't know
what I'm thinking.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.104
I think I do.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.870
The place you're in now,

15:04.905 --> 15:07.473
that's where I live.

15:10.107 --> 15:12.606
Look, I'm just gonna go talk
to the guy, all right?

15:12.641 --> 15:14.371
- There's no...
- That's all. Stay here.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.640
Hey, Bolston.

15:17.675 --> 15:21.615
I'm Captain Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco Police Department.

15:21.650 --> 15:24.416
This is a legal strike, Captain.
We've got every right to be here.

15:24.451 --> 15:26.148
I don't care about your strike.

15:26.183 --> 15:28.490
There was a shooting
on Highway 9 this morning.

15:28.525 --> 15:31.183
- A driver was killed.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

15:31.218 --> 15:32.901
I already talked to the cops.

15:32.936 --> 15:35.513
I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told them...

15:35.548 --> 15:37.512
I had nothing to do with that.

15:37.547 --> 15:40.831
It's what we call serendipity.

15:40.866 --> 15:42.650
"Serendipity."

15:42.685 --> 15:46.822
You've got five seconds to wipe
that smile off your face.

15:47.888 --> 15:49.397
Did you say this?

15:49.432 --> 15:52.493
"We're gonna bring this company down
using any means necessary"?

15:52.528 --> 15:54.850
- Did you say that?
- No. I was misquoted.

15:54.885 --> 15:57.643
- You know how that goes.
- This is incitement, you son of a bitch.

15:57.678 --> 15:59.449
You might as well have pulled
the trigger yourself.

15:59.484 --> 16:02.622
Now look, Captain. I can't control
every member of my union,

16:02.657 --> 16:08.614
just like you can't control every stupid,
loudmouth cop in your department, can you?

16:08.649 --> 16:10.700
You're Frank Wicks, aren't you?

16:10.735 --> 16:13.949
I brought you in for assault
during the last strike, didn't I?

16:13.984 --> 16:16.007
- You got a good memory.
- You're damn right I do.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.844
- Do you own a hunting rifle, Wicks?
- I don't have a gun.

16:18.879 --> 16:21.710
- I don't need one.
- Right.

16:21.745 --> 16:24.474
- Where were you at 6:00 this morning?
- He was with me.

16:24.509 --> 16:27.625
We were here, okay?
All morning, setting up.

16:27.660 --> 16:31.535
Captain! The hospital just called.
Karen's awake.

16:32.148 --> 16:34.125
This isn't over.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.440
I got 10 lawyers.
Call one of'em!

16:44.061 --> 16:47.188
We've stopped the hemorrhaging
and all the internal bleeding.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.708
About an hour ago she
started fasciculating.

16:49.743 --> 16:50.954
Oh, my Lord!

16:50.989 --> 16:53.635
No, no, no. That's a good thing.
It means she's... she's stable.

16:53.670 --> 16:55.293
She's not out of the woods yet.

16:55.328 --> 16:57.653
We still don't know
how serious the head injury is.

16:57.688 --> 16:59.871
The next six hours will tell the story.

16:59.906 --> 17:01.143
Can we see her?

17:01.178 --> 17:04.424
Maybe tomorrow after the surgery.

17:04.459 --> 17:08.685
I think her husband
could use some help.

17:18.219 --> 17:19.472
Hey.

17:21.019 --> 17:23.013
I hate hospitals.

17:23.049 --> 17:26.667
The doctor says she's stable.
Thank God.

17:26.703 --> 17:29.856
She woke up for a couple minutes. I...

17:29.891 --> 17:33.415
She could barely breathe.
That's how much pain she's in.

17:33.450 --> 17:37.192
She asked how the kids were.
I said the kids were fine.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.614
She passed out again.

17:39.649 --> 17:41.514
If I lose her...

17:43.326 --> 17:44.824
What if I lose her?

17:44.859 --> 17:46.365
You're not. You're not.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.685
You're not gonna lose her.

17:49.051 --> 17:54.266
"Not gonna lose her."
I remember I said that to you one time.

17:59.545 --> 18:01.288
I'm sorry.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.415
I'm sorry.

18:12.972 --> 18:15.138
Peanut bar.

18:15.777 --> 18:17.930
I hate these.
Do you want it?

18:17.965 --> 18:20.698
- Why'd you buy it?
- I didn't buy it.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.074
I felt like hitting something.

18:30.269 --> 18:32.785
Adrian, I'm gonna spank you.
Come on.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.029
- Are you talking to me or the dog?
- Both.

18:36.585 --> 18:38.660
Ooh! - Oh, I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll...
I'll stay here.

18:38.695 --> 18:41.372
That's a good idea. Come on.

18:41.911 --> 18:43.615
Come on. Come on.

18:45.876 --> 18:49.000
Samson! There you are!

18:49.035 --> 18:50.599
Oh! Where you been, huh?

18:50.634 --> 18:52.133
Where's you been? Mmm.

18:52.168 --> 18:53.331
Where's my squirrel?

18:53.366 --> 18:56.293
Usually when he runs away he brings
me back a dead squirrel.

18:56.328 --> 18:57.870
You must be disappointed.

18:57.905 --> 19:01.140
Your taste is getting better.
She's a lot cuter than a dead squirrel.

19:01.175 --> 19:02.886
Thanks.

19:03.812 --> 19:04.950
I'm Evan Coker.

19:04.985 --> 19:06.392
Uh, Sharona Fleming.

19:06.427 --> 19:08.968
Sharona, I...
I don't know how to thank you.

19:09.003 --> 19:11.146
I... I've been going out of my mind.

19:11.181 --> 19:13.292
I don't know how he got away.

19:13.327 --> 19:14.872
I must have left the gate open.

19:14.907 --> 19:16.245
Well, he's really a great dog.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.536
I had to leave him at my sister's,
'cause if I brought him home,

19:18.571 --> 19:20.814
my son would have fallen in love with him.

19:20.849 --> 19:23.106
He gets very attached to pets, you know?

19:23.141 --> 19:27.188
I think it's because his father's
not around. I...

19:27.223 --> 19:28.837
I'm divorced.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.070
- Okay.
- All right.

19:33.431 --> 19:36.157
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

19:36.192 --> 19:39.028
I just got it.
It's kind of an impulse thing.

19:39.063 --> 19:42.254
Well, impulses can be fun.

19:42.822 --> 19:44.577
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

19:44.612 --> 19:45.482
Hi.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.554
I was, uh, just fixing your sundial.

19:47.589 --> 19:50.386
- Yeah, leave it alone. It's fine.
- Ahhh.

19:50.421 --> 19:51.952
It's five hours off.

19:51.987 --> 19:54.496
No, it's not.
My son checked it last week.

19:54.531 --> 19:57.371
Oh! Well, he did it wrong.

19:57.406 --> 20:00.722
- Well, he's an astronomer.
- Oh.

20:01.432 --> 20:03.128
Maybe his watch was broken?

20:03.163 --> 20:04.634
Who are you?

20:04.669 --> 20:06.156
Just a concerned citizen, ma'am.

20:06.191 --> 20:08.493
Just a Good Samaritan just passing by.

20:08.528 --> 20:11.467
- You're demented!
- Well, that's a matter of opinion.

20:11.502 --> 20:14.067
Oh. There you go.

20:14.563 --> 20:16.213
It's all done, and you'll thank me later.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.257
Get out of my yard, you creep!

20:19.962 --> 20:21.538
Do you know him?

20:21.573 --> 20:23.513
Yeah, he's my boss.

20:23.548 --> 20:25.479
I don't know how he got out.

20:25.514 --> 20:27.673
I must have left the gate open.

20:28.878 --> 20:31.226
- So what does he do?
- He's a detective.

20:31.261 --> 20:34.366
We're working with the police now
on that sniper case.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.919
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
They think it's a union thing, right?

20:36.954 --> 20:37.934
No, no. My...

20:37.969 --> 20:40.480
- My boss doesn't think so.
- Oh, he doesn't?

20:40.515 --> 20:41.620
No.

20:41.655 --> 20:44.624
And believe it or not, he's never wrong.

20:54.149 --> 20:55.199
Hi, Karen.

20:55.234 --> 20:56.858
Hi! - Hi.

20:56.893 --> 20:58.844
- Hello.
- Are those lilacs?

20:58.879 --> 21:00.988
I love lilacs. Thank you.

21:01.023 --> 21:03.222
- Will you put 'em here?
- Sure.

21:03.257 --> 21:06.030
- How do you feel?
- Like I was hit by a truck.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.423
Ah, get it? - Oh. I do.

21:08.458 --> 21:12.618
Shhh. He's been sleeping there all night.

21:28.324 --> 21:29.741
What are you doing?

21:29.776 --> 21:31.305
Just making them even.

21:31.340 --> 21:34.264
- Even?
- You'll sleep better if they're even.

21:34.299 --> 21:35.746
What are you talking about?

21:35.781 --> 21:37.838
Hey! Did Max draw this?

21:37.873 --> 21:39.834
Yeah. The boys were here all morning.

21:39.869 --> 21:42.159
You know, they're
the best medicine in the world.

21:42.194 --> 21:45.162
You know, if... if there's anything
we can do, we...

21:45.197 --> 21:46.614
Well, as a matter of fact are
you busy tomorrow?

21:46.649 --> 21:49.093
Because we need someone to
take the boys out to lunch.

21:49.128 --> 21:52.607
Yeah. Sharona, I promised my mother
that I'd give her a break.

21:52.642 --> 21:53.829
But I've got to work, so...

21:53.864 --> 21:56.879
You know, I'd love to,
but Benjy has a dentist appointment.

21:56.914 --> 22:00.039
Hey! But Adrian can take 'em!

22:00.074 --> 22:02.643
- Uhh...
- They would love that!

22:02.678 --> 22:04.252
Would you mind, Adrian?

22:04.287 --> 22:06.920
You mean, take the children
to a restaurant?

22:06.955 --> 22:08.658
- Uh-huh.
- You mean, a public restaurant?

22:08.693 --> 22:11.812
- Umm...
- They would love it.

22:12.349 --> 22:15.423
Sure. Great idea.

22:16.276 --> 22:18.220
Boy, I can't wait.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.992
Monk, I'm wide awake.

22:24.462 --> 22:26.481
Wide awake.

22:50.705 --> 22:51.728
Get over here.!

22:51.763 --> 22:53.840
He's hurt bad.! Hurry up.!

22:59.545 --> 23:03.446
Right. Okay, good work. Captain?

23:03.481 --> 23:05.175
- What?
- You were right.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.715
Second shooting at the truck depot?

23:07.750 --> 23:10.114
Thirty-aught-six from
a Winchester... the same gun.

23:10.149 --> 23:12.014
So they're both union related.

23:12.049 --> 23:13.563
Don't try to tell me any different.

23:13.598 --> 23:15.642
- What about the barefoot angle?
- What about it?

23:15.677 --> 23:17.492
Well, Monk seems to think
the union isn't... - Look.!

23:17.527 --> 23:21.673
It's not his wife being fed
through a tube, is it?

23:21.708 --> 23:23.248
No, sir.

23:23.694 --> 23:26.617
You know, I've been reading about this,
uh... this sniper.

23:26.652 --> 23:29.394
That's, uh, really terrifying.

23:29.429 --> 23:31.866
The police think it's union related.

23:31.901 --> 23:34.140
And what-what, you don't agree?

23:34.175 --> 23:39.984
I think the second shooting was
a diversion to throw us all off the trail.

23:40.019 --> 23:44.593
Hmm. Well, it's still a tough case.
How do you feel?

23:44.628 --> 23:46.194
I'm torn.

23:46.229 --> 23:48.906
Half of me is worried about Karen,

23:48.941 --> 23:54.046
and 40% is worried about
Captain Stottlemeyer,

23:54.081 --> 23:58.901
and five percent...
is relieved...

23:58.936 --> 24:04.281
that somebody finally understands
what I've been going through.

24:04.316 --> 24:06.353
You know that's not 100%?

24:06.388 --> 24:08.442
I know. I always keep...

24:08.477 --> 24:13.183
part of me empty
for-for emergencies.

24:13.218 --> 24:17.641
What... So-So, what, you-you offered
to take the two boys to lunch?

24:17.676 --> 24:19.502
I didn't exactly offer.

24:19.537 --> 24:22.568
I just felt it was, uh...

24:23.652 --> 24:27.638
it was something that
I-I-I had to, uh... Sorry.

24:27.673 --> 24:30.489
I can't concentrate.
What is that noise?

24:30.524 --> 24:33.012
Oh. Oh, that's, uh,
the white noise machine.

24:33.047 --> 24:35.334
We've always had it here.

24:35.369 --> 24:37.944
No, this one's different.

24:37.979 --> 24:40.785
Well, yeah. I mean,
the-the other one broke.

24:40.820 --> 24:44.612
Uh, it's just a new... newer model.
But it's the same.

24:44.647 --> 24:46.888
No, it's not.

24:46.923 --> 24:51.463
No. The old one went,
"shuuu."

24:51.498 --> 24:55.001
And this one goes, "shiii,"

24:55.036 --> 24:57.697
not "shuuu," "shiii."

24:57.732 --> 25:00.696
It's like a half an octave higher. I'm...

25:00.731 --> 25:03.028
I'm sure all your patients
are complaining.

25:03.063 --> 25:05.705
No, No, actually, you're the only one.

25:05.740 --> 25:08.939
Well, they're being polite.

25:14.106 --> 25:16.277
Is that better?

25:16.674 --> 25:17.986
No.

25:18.349 --> 25:19.495
No.

25:19.530 --> 25:24.747
All right, Adrian, would you like me
to try to get the old machine fixed?

25:24.782 --> 25:26.660
- Oh, that would be great.
- Uh-huh.

25:26.695 --> 25:28.350
Thank you.

25:29.170 --> 25:32.074
I'll wait here.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.156
I didn't mean now, Adrian.

25:35.191 --> 25:38.401
I'll try to have it for next week.

25:40.645 --> 25:42.835
- Captain.
- What's that?

25:42.870 --> 25:44.958
That savings and loan robbery
in Delmare last Monday.

25:44.993 --> 25:47.791
Clerk was shot and killed
during the get away.

25:48.419 --> 25:51.536
- The clerk was 22 years old.
- I got it, Rick.

25:51.571 --> 25:53.185
Captain?

25:53.220 --> 25:54.390
Captain.

25:54.425 --> 25:57.496
What? - We've got other cases, sir,
and they're starting to pile up.

25:57.531 --> 26:00.307
No! Randy, you have other cases.

26:00.342 --> 26:03.958
In this room, there are no other cases.!

26:03.993 --> 26:05.996
Understood?

26:08.473 --> 26:10.318
What the hell is this?
What is he doing here?

26:10.353 --> 26:12.507
Harry Bolston to see Agent Grooms.

26:12.542 --> 26:13.949
Yeah. He'll be right with you.

26:13.984 --> 26:16.379
Good. You got a room around here
where I can make a call in private?

26:16.414 --> 26:18.571
Right out here, first door to your right.

26:18.606 --> 26:21.834
- Agent Grooms called him in.
- He... Without my okay?

26:21.869 --> 26:23.263
According to Grooms,
he's been cooperating.

26:23.298 --> 26:24.921
Yeah, I'll bet he's been cooperating.

26:24.956 --> 26:26.103
Sir, don't.

26:26.138 --> 26:29.259
Randy. This is my house.

26:29.294 --> 26:32.576
Randy, the man is in my house.

26:37.888 --> 26:41.002
- Where'd Bolston go?
- Conference room.

26:41.913 --> 26:43.808
Just spend the money.

26:43.843 --> 26:47.400
Yeah, that's what the strike fund is for.

26:47.435 --> 26:48.624
Later.

26:49.332 --> 26:51.258
Captain Stottlemeyer.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.737
Captain Stottlemeyer is not here.

26:58.720 --> 27:02.541
It's just us, Harry.
Just a couple of guys.

27:05.039 --> 27:07.427
I heard about your wife.

27:07.462 --> 27:09.577
I'm sorry, I really am.

27:09.612 --> 27:12.170
- What's her name?
- Her name is Karen.

27:12.205 --> 27:13.414
Well, I'll look into it.

27:13.449 --> 27:16.014
And if it was one of my crew,
I'll take care of it.

27:16.049 --> 27:19.615
It was one of your crew, Harry.

27:19.808 --> 27:22.668
Probably handpicked.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.540
- Everything okay, boss?
- Yeah.

27:27.575 --> 27:30.984
Why don't you call in some more goons,
make it a fair fight?

27:31.019 --> 27:34.724
Now, listen, Captain. I can't do business
with you hounding me like this.

27:34.759 --> 27:38.836
So what's it gonna take to
get you off of my back?

27:39.720 --> 27:44.497
It's gonna take a heck of lot more
than your girlfriend here.

27:47.779 --> 27:48.601
Stay down!

27:48.877 --> 27:51.092
Stay down!

27:52.661 --> 27:54.449
Oh, boy!

27:56.151 --> 27:57.991
- What did you do?
- He didn't do anything.

27:58.026 --> 28:01.341
My friend tripped...

28:01.654 --> 28:04.872
on his own shoelaces.

28:10.885 --> 28:13.488
It wasn't me.

28:18.895 --> 28:20.717
Ever been here before, Mr. Monk?

28:20.752 --> 28:21.993
No.

28:22.028 --> 28:24.271
No, I don't... go out much.

28:24.306 --> 28:25.718
Oh, we come here all the time.

28:25.753 --> 28:28.186
Well, I can see why.

28:28.221 --> 28:30.842
It's so... loud...

28:30.877 --> 28:34.690
and... loud.

28:34.725 --> 28:38.008
- Is this really what the '50s were like?
- Exactly.

28:38.043 --> 28:40.789
It's like a time machine.

28:42.151 --> 28:46.734
Max, stay in the lines, okay?

28:46.769 --> 28:50.060
Max, you have to stay inside the lines.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.609
I don't want to.

28:51.644 --> 28:55.527
Please. It's-It's a rule.

28:55.562 --> 28:58.172
Rules are fun, huh?

29:02.788 --> 29:04.698
Finish that later, okay?

29:04.733 --> 29:06.653
Hey, cats and kittens, what's shaking?

29:06.688 --> 29:08.481
I'm Cindy-Lou.
I'll be your waitress.

29:08.516 --> 29:09.782
Who's ready to roll?

29:09.817 --> 29:11.570
I'll have an Astro Burger and a Coke.

29:11.605 --> 29:13.998
Me, too. - Yeah.

29:14.033 --> 29:15.708
How about you, Pops?

29:15.743 --> 29:17.775
Uhhh.

29:18.452 --> 29:21.786
Uh, nothing.
I'm fine. I'm good.

29:21.821 --> 29:24.418
I just ate, uh,

29:24.453 --> 29:26.476
nine hours ago.

29:26.511 --> 29:30.084
All right. I'll be back in two shakes.

29:30.670 --> 29:32.246
Say something crazy.

29:32.281 --> 29:34.602
Hey Max, he's not crazy, okay?

29:34.637 --> 29:37.460
He's... troubled.

29:38.031 --> 29:39.742
Thank you, Jared.

29:39.777 --> 29:41.940
I saw your mom today.

29:41.975 --> 29:44.599
She-She's really doing great.

29:44.634 --> 29:47.642
The doctors say she's gonna be
coming home soon.

29:47.677 --> 29:50.824
I pray for her every night.

29:51.317 --> 29:53.795
Yeah, me too.

30:24.130 --> 30:26.244
Check please.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.187
- Isn't this fun?
- Yes, it is.

30:31.222 --> 30:33.917
But what are you gonna do?

30:51.914 --> 30:53.890
What is it with you and this sundial?

30:53.925 --> 30:58.498
I remembered something when
I was with Stottlemeyer's kids.

30:58.533 --> 31:01.726
- How'd that go?
- Fine, fine. Kids love me.

31:01.761 --> 31:03.009
Oh, my God, he's back!

31:03.044 --> 31:05.465
I told you before!
This is private property!

31:05.500 --> 31:07.393
We'll just be one second, ma'am.

31:07.428 --> 31:08.607
Thank you very much.

31:08.642 --> 31:10.151
Call the captain.
I solved the case.

31:10.186 --> 31:11.823
Go!

31:11.858 --> 31:14.633
- Who... What... She did it?
- No. I wish she did.

31:14.668 --> 31:18.609
- You solved it with the sundial?
- The sundial is the key.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.522
Okay, we've got our warrant.

31:22.557 --> 31:25.139
We're going into the union
headquarters building here.

31:25.174 --> 31:28.031
- I need a block at these two
intersections. - It's already done, sir.

31:28.066 --> 31:30.863
All right, now, the main offices are
on floors two and three.

31:30.898 --> 31:33.421
- Are they armed?
- We're not sure. Assume yes.

31:33.456 --> 31:34.379
We're going in heavy.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.900
Two entry teams... here and here.

31:36.935 --> 31:38.131
Nobody's knocking.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.387
We pick and ram.

31:39.422 --> 31:41.848
- Who's takin' point on Team One?
- That would be me.

31:41.883 --> 31:44.210
I go in first.
Harry Bolston is mine.

31:44.245 --> 31:46.695
- Any questions?
- Okay, it's showtime!

31:46.730 --> 31:49.394
- Disher.
- Suit up! Vests and helmets!

31:50.238 --> 31:52.959
Okay. Captain, that was Monk.

31:57.669 --> 32:00.523
He said he solved the case.

32:01.369 --> 32:06.011
- He what?
- He says it's not a union thing.

32:09.464 --> 32:11.498
Is he sure?

32:11.533 --> 32:13.697
He's Monk.

32:15.226 --> 32:17.952
It's your call, Captain.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.686
Stand down!

32:31.879 --> 32:33.366
Hey, Monk!

32:34.749 --> 32:36.397
What do you got?
You got a name? Okay.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.411
- Take it easy.
- Don't worry.

32:38.446 --> 32:40.952
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
I promised Karen.

32:40.987 --> 32:41.930
What do you got?

32:41.965 --> 32:43.690
Evan Coker.
This was his car.

32:43.725 --> 32:46.795
This was the car that was being towed
when the driver was shot on Monday.

32:46.830 --> 32:49.940
Yeah, remember that dog I found?
It belonged to Evan Coker.

32:49.975 --> 32:52.523
Coker, yeah.
Yeah, it was being repossessed.

32:52.558 --> 32:55.392
I mean, we checked him out.
He was clean.

32:55.427 --> 32:58.131
I mean, I don't even think
he was worried about losing it.

32:58.166 --> 33:01.154
- Didn't he just buy a new T-Bird?
- He didn't care about the car.

33:01.189 --> 33:04.211
He cared about something in the car.

33:04.633 --> 33:05.860
What, money?

33:05.895 --> 33:07.492
A handgun in the glove compartment.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.763
Look at the owner's manual.

33:10.161 --> 33:12.000
That's gun oil, isn't it?

33:12.035 --> 33:13.442
It sure is.

33:13.477 --> 33:15.252
He kept a handgun in here.

33:15.287 --> 33:18.644
- A gun he had to get back.
- Why?

33:18.679 --> 33:22.594
I... I don't know. Obviously, it...

33:22.629 --> 33:24.766
it connected him to something.

33:24.801 --> 33:27.148
Something worth killing for.

33:27.183 --> 33:29.060
Here's what happened.

33:30.170 --> 33:34.827
On Monday morning, the sound of the
tow truck must have woken him up.

33:36.501 --> 33:38.700
His car was being repossessed.

33:38.735 --> 33:41.098
He knew that if the car ever
got to the impound lot,

33:41.133 --> 33:42.482
they'd find his gun.

33:42.517 --> 33:44.552
Somehow he had to stop that truck.

33:44.587 --> 33:46.611
He had less than a minute to
come up with a plan.

33:46.646 --> 33:49.612
He didn't have time to get dressed
or put his shoes on,

33:49.647 --> 33:52.007
which explains the footprints.

33:52.042 --> 33:55.394
The truck had to go all the way back
through town to reach the highway.

33:55.429 --> 33:57.851
He knew that if he ran,
he could head it off.

33:57.886 --> 33:59.702
That's how the dog got loose...

33:59.737 --> 34:03.567
and how the sundial next door
got turned around.

34:05.948 --> 34:08.029
He cut through the backyards,

34:08.063 --> 34:10.795
across the edge of the park,

34:11.607 --> 34:14.909
climbed through the chain-link fence,

34:15.837 --> 34:18.315
and waited for the tow truck.

34:19.179 --> 34:22.893
Then... - Yeah, I know
what happened after that.

34:37.813 --> 34:41.949
Right after the crash,
he retrieved the gun.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.378
There was a gravel road, and
he didn't want to walk home barefoot.

34:47.413 --> 34:51.331
So before he left,
he stole the dead driver's shoes.

34:51.367 --> 34:56.496
And somehow he managed to get out of
there without anyone noticing him.

34:57.130 --> 34:58.738
Don't move her!
Don't move her! - Get some help!

34:58.773 --> 35:00.843
Well, what about the second
shooting at the truck depot?

35:00.878 --> 35:02.349
Strictly for our benefit.

35:02.384 --> 35:06.213
He wanted us to keep thinking
it was a union thing.

35:06.248 --> 35:08.418
What do you think?

35:08.644 --> 35:10.252
- It's good enough for me.
- Okay, Captain.

35:10.287 --> 35:11.157
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

35:11.192 --> 35:12.648
Captain, wait. We've got to...

35:12.683 --> 35:14.536
We've got to call the task force.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.269
We need a search warrant.

35:16.304 --> 35:18.284
We got this guy.
We've got him.

35:18.319 --> 35:21.221
Let's do it right.

35:34.241 --> 35:35.562
Hey!

35:35.913 --> 35:36.888
What are you doing here?

35:36.923 --> 35:38.799
I was just in the neighborhood.

35:38.834 --> 35:40.129
Hi.!

35:40.886 --> 35:42.029
He missed you.

35:42.064 --> 35:44.378
Actually, we both did.

35:44.807 --> 35:46.450
What happened to your feet?

35:46.485 --> 35:48.539
Oh, a windsurfing accident.

35:48.574 --> 35:50.901
Mm. - You wanna come in?

35:50.936 --> 35:52.843
Well, actually I'm not alone.

35:52.878 --> 35:54.500
I have a few friends with me.

35:54.535 --> 35:56.793
Great. The more the merrier.

36:00.782 --> 36:03.748
- What's going on?
- It's a warrant.

36:03.783 --> 36:06.559
My friends wanna look around.

36:06.707 --> 36:08.026
Look for what?

36:08.061 --> 36:10.831
A rifle, a handgun,
maybe a pair of shoes...

36:10.866 --> 36:13.488
taken off a dead truck driver.

36:14.985 --> 36:17.310
Do you know who I am?

36:19.411 --> 36:23.170
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.

36:23.205 --> 36:25.362
I read about you, uh...

36:26.002 --> 36:28.410
How's your wife?

36:30.612 --> 36:33.039
My wife is gonna be fine.

36:33.074 --> 36:35.653
The doctors saved her life.

36:35.688 --> 36:40.205
You should call them and thank them,
because they saved yours too.

36:56.287 --> 37:01.186
You might wanna let the lieutenant
hold that for you.

37:01.221 --> 37:04.152
Why? Are you afraid I'll use it?

37:05.881 --> 37:08.471
I would.

37:10.378 --> 37:13.637
I understand now, Monk.

37:14.004 --> 37:17.046
You can't let it go, can you?

37:18.357 --> 37:19.967
No.

37:23.601 --> 37:26.424
Don't ever lose that watch.

37:26.459 --> 37:27.927
I won't.

37:27.962 --> 37:30.499
- Anything?
- Not yet.

37:30.956 --> 37:32.028
Is that it?

37:32.063 --> 37:35.298
Can I start cleaning
my place up now, please?

37:35.333 --> 37:36.189
No.

37:36.224 --> 37:38.775
Step inside. I'd like to ask you
some more questions.

37:38.810 --> 37:40.356
Thank you.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.293
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

37:51.796 --> 37:53.316
It's garbage day!

37:53.351 --> 37:55.748
Hey! Stop!
Stop the truck!

37:55.783 --> 37:57.028
What are you doing?

37:57.063 --> 37:58.659
Hold it.!
Hold it there.!

37:58.694 --> 38:01.002
Oh, my God, Mo', it's him, man.

38:01.037 --> 38:02.880
- How'd he find us?
- Leave that garbage!

38:02.915 --> 38:04.912
- Let's just go, man. Let's just go.
- Don't... Wait up!

38:04.947 --> 38:07.154
- You've got the gun.!
- Go! Go! Let's get out of here!

38:07.189 --> 38:10.657
Wait! Don't go!
Don't go! Wait!

38:10.692 --> 38:14.374
- That guy is demented.
- No, no, no, wait!

38:14.409 --> 38:16.579
It's going!

38:16.614 --> 38:18.427
Stop.! Stop.!

38:18.462 --> 38:20.784
There's evidence in there.!

38:20.978 --> 38:23.814
Stop. There's evidence in there!
Wait up!

38:23.849 --> 38:26.438
Turn off the compactor!

38:35.766 --> 38:39.286
Did Adrian Monk just jump into
a garbage truck?

38:39.321 --> 38:40.851
Yeah.

39:11.665 --> 39:14.678
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

39:15.801 --> 39:18.461
Brown Merrills, ten and a half.

39:18.496 --> 39:21.337
You get these off the driver you shot?

39:21.372 --> 39:23.963
What else you got in the bag?

39:28.773 --> 39:30.860
Beretta, a nine-millimeter.

39:30.895 --> 39:33.446
The savings and loan job in Delmare.

39:34.924 --> 39:36.377
Do me a favor!

39:36.412 --> 39:37.633
Do me a favor!

39:37.668 --> 39:39.708
Resist! Go ahead, please!

39:39.743 --> 39:41.726
Captain, don't.! Captain.

39:41.761 --> 39:42.743
Don't do this.

39:42.778 --> 39:44.861
Don't do this.
You'll lose your badge.

39:44.896 --> 39:47.279
It's not worth it.

39:50.842 --> 39:53.123
You're right. He's not.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.332
He's not worth it.

39:56.603 --> 40:00.506
Arrest him.
Don't hurt him.

40:01.582 --> 40:04.555
Mr. Coker, you're under arrest
for three counts of felony murder.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.570
Get him out of here!

40:07.165 --> 40:09.228
Read him his rights.

40:30.168 --> 40:31.890
Hi!

40:32.152 --> 40:33.343
Hi!

40:33.378 --> 40:36.977
- Mommy!
- Boys! Oh, my little sweeties.

40:37.012 --> 40:40.336
Hi. Oh, I missed you so much.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.549
I love you fellas.

40:43.584 --> 40:44.862
Smile.

40:44.897 --> 40:47.153
Oh, my... Where did you get that?

40:47.188 --> 40:49.477
- I bought it.
- A digital camera!

40:49.512 --> 40:51.252
Oh, Leland!

40:51.287 --> 40:54.679
But we can't afford it, and the other
camera was not even insured.

40:54.714 --> 40:56.485
- It's only money.
- "Only money"?

40:56.520 --> 40:59.188
Yeah. - Who got hit on the head,
me or you?

40:59.223 --> 41:00.235
That would be me.

41:00.270 --> 41:02.048
Oh! Mmm!

41:02.083 --> 41:03.337
Ew!

41:05.404 --> 41:08.348
- I love you.
- I love you too.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.847
Mmm.
