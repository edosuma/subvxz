15:38.105 --> 15:40.940
Ray, you're missing

15:40.940 --> 15:45.112
He's a successful father of two,
but then his mom dies,

15:45.112 --> 15:47.947
so he starts to dress up
like her, you know, as you do,

15:47.947 --> 15:51.493

to the kids that grandma's dead.

it was drug-related.

And?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.807
It wasn't.

after a taping.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.397

of the knife,

23:51.472 --> 23:53.683
[Cochran]
Excellent.

23:53.683 --> 23:55.309
That's the right decision.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.354
[chuckles]

23:58.354 --> 23:59.939
Do you mind if I use
your bathroom?

23:59.939 --> 24:01.691
I'm sorry.
My bathroom?

24:01.691 --> 24:03.652
[Cochran] Yeah, I had
a lot of Mexican for lunch,

24:03.652 --> 24:04.944
and there's absolutely no way
I'm making it

24:04.944 --> 24:06.737
back to the West Side.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.823
[sighs]
Yeah.

24:08.823 --> 24:11.284
Thank you.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.869
This fucking guy.

24:12.869 --> 24:16.665
He's tried to fuck you
I don't know how many times.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.502
Keep an eye on Holt.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.253
Let me know
if anything changes.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.297
Cochran cannot be trusted.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.301
I got this, Avi.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.845
You never listen to me, Ray.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.806
Please, stop.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.475
Think it through.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.230
Why should you listen to me?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.941
I'm just the one
who always has it right.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.533
[cell phone ringing]

24:54.243 --> 24:56.245
[cell phone beeps]

24:56.245 --> 24:57.705
Hello?

24:59.707 --> 25:01.250
This is Brendan.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.257
Oh. Yes.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.303
Yes, he--he dates men.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.474
I don't know.

25:16.474 --> 25:20.728
Um, they usually
don't have names.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.733
He just...

25:24.733 --> 25:26.233
brings them by,

25:26.233 --> 25:29.236
uh, doesn't even introduce them
or anything.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.657
Okay.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.743
Yeah, no problem.

25:34.743 --> 25:37.746
[clears throat]

25:37.746 --> 25:39.748
I got a feeling
you're next.

25:39.748 --> 25:40.957
Yeah, great.

25:44.585 --> 25:45.711
Hey.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.546
What's happening?

25:47.546 --> 25:49.758
[Terry] We're clearing out
for Hector Campos.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.133
Hector Campos?

25:51.133 --> 25:55.179
[Bunchy] Yeah, he's training
here as of today.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.223
Gonna be on the news
and everything.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.766
We're gonna be
a big part of it.

25:58.766 --> 26:01.018
What, here, at the gym?

26:01.018 --> 26:04.522
Yeah. Why?

26:04.522 --> 26:06.148
Nothing.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.609
You're just gonna have
your hands full. That's all.

26:11.487 --> 26:12.989
Yeah, champion of the world.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.657
He's gonna put us on the map.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.201
[cell phone ringing]

26:17.201 --> 26:18.411
Wow.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.330
Hello?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.541
Y-yeah, I'm his son.
Yeah.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.376
[baby squeals]

26:25.376 --> 26:28.004
[sighs]
Yeah, he goes with men.

26:28.004 --> 26:31.882
Uh, yeah,
he goes with men.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.969
Yeah, he's gay.

26:34.969 --> 26:38.640
He's gay with men.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.600
Good. Thank you.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.728
What the fuck
was that about?

26:43.728 --> 26:46.815
That was the county jail.

26:46.815 --> 26:50.026
We got to say Mick's queer.

26:50.026 --> 26:53.738
Hey, uh, Abs,
can I ask you something?

26:53.738 --> 26:55.782
Yeah.

26:55.782 --> 27:00.161
Do you think maybe you could
watch Maria a little bit longer?

27:00.161 --> 27:02.663
What, like, for tonight
or what?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.833
Maybe longer.

27:04.833 --> 27:08.169
[baby murmuring]

27:08.169 --> 27:09.336
Bunchy, I mean--

27:09.336 --> 27:11.380
She needs a mother right now,

27:11.380 --> 27:14.800
and--and I can't do it
with all I got going on here.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.344
You're the best mother
I know.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.641
[baby grumbling happily]

27:26.645 --> 27:28.815
All right, fine.
Fuck it.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.608
- Thank you.
- What else am I doing?

27:30.608 --> 27:33.486
Aw, you're gonna stay
with Aunt Abby.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.737
[laughs]

27:37.406 --> 27:39.617
Ray Donovan?

27:39.617 --> 27:41.285
I'm Korea,
from Nick Lowell's office.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.620
- Hi.
- You ready?

27:42.620 --> 27:43.871
Sure.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.376
Mm-hmm.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.340
We've been over this, folks.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.008
She has to fly private.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.344
She's bringing
her whole family.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.847
You want coconut water?

28:00.847 --> 28:02.098
No. I'm good.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.850
Yes.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.060
She understands
the budget parameters,

28:06.060 --> 28:08.270
but she's got a lot
on her plate.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.605
Kombucha?

28:09.605 --> 28:10.815
What?

28:12.566 --> 28:14.401
It's okay. He's good.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.071
No. No.

28:17.071 --> 28:18.697
No, she's not a 16-year-old.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.407
She's an international
superstar.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.993
I have a 16-year-old at home.
She doesn't fill stadiums.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.871
She  flies coach.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.458
O-okay, you know what?
Talk amongst yourselves.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.709
I have somebody
in the office.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.712
[exhales]

28:33.712 --> 28:35.214
What's up, Ray?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.842
Which one of my clients is
in trouble?

28:37.842 --> 28:40.094
I wanted to talk to you
about Tommy Wheeler.

28:40.094 --> 28:42.471
I fucking love  Tommy.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.431
He's my favorite actor
who I don't represent.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.894
Well, it's, uh--it's not
working out with his agent.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.897
Not working out for Tommy
or not working out for you?

28:53.274 --> 28:55.234
Neither of us.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.946
[laughs]

28:58.946 --> 29:01.282
Are you giving me
Tommy Wheeler, Ray?

29:01.282 --> 29:04.326
- He wants to meet first.
- When can he come in?

29:04.326 --> 29:05.911
Not here.

29:05.911 --> 29:09.039
He wants to be discreet.
No, no, no, I get it.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.667
My apartment,
Sunset Towers.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.212
Yeah. Come here. Mm.

29:15.212 --> 29:18.883
God damn.
Ray to the motherfucking D.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.805
Sometimes...

29:24.805 --> 29:28.767
you come across something
so sweet in life,

29:28.767 --> 29:31.770
and then it all disappears.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.107
She sounds lovely.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.986
She can sing, too...
[chuckles]

29:37.986 --> 29:39.320
Like a nightingale.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.780
How you get a job
in the kitchen?

29:43.741 --> 29:45.576
You want a job
in the kitchen?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.374
Put your name
on the clipboard back there.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.375
Donovan.

29:57.005 --> 30:00.842
I'll be back.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.801
So we need another number.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.971
I'm not getting through
to your middle son.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.931
- Ray?
- Yeah, Ray.

30:06.931 --> 30:10.434
- [Mickey] I gave you his cell.
- [Mancini] It's not working.

30:10.434 --> 30:13.812
He's not picking up.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.274
[Mickey] I can give you
his home in Calabasas.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.692
It's an 818 number.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.028
How's my application coming?

30:21.028 --> 30:24.490
I'm working on it.
Don't worry.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.912
[Mancini]
Thank you.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.462
Hey, that's
my fucking lunch.

30:38.462 --> 30:39.755
You want it back?

30:40.923 --> 30:43.885
Not now, you fucking
slobbered in it.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.932
Piece of work.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.853
[laughs]

30:54.853 --> 30:56.272
Let me wipe it.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.066
You're like a baby. Look.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.066
Yeah, yeah.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.944
[knock at door]

31:01.944 --> 31:05.031
Is this really necessary, Ray?
I don't need a new agent.

31:05.031 --> 31:09.077
I've been with Steven
for over ten years.

31:09.077 --> 31:10.869
[sighs]

31:10.869 --> 31:14.123
Shit.

31:14.123 --> 31:17.085
Ray to the motherfucking D.

31:17.085 --> 31:19.712
Tommy, it's good to see you.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.089
You look great.
Doesn't he look great?

31:21.089 --> 31:21.922
Yeah.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.340
Look at you.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.676
Huh?

31:25.676 --> 31:27.761
- You got some guns there.
- Thanks, man.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.722
- Right?
- Thank you.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.933
Tommy, I got to tell you.

31:31.933 --> 31:32.933
I'm sitting, I'm having
breakfast with the boys

31:32.933 --> 31:35.019
from Paramount this morning.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.103
They fucking love you, bro.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.064
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.857
That's good to hear,
'cause it seems

31:39.857 --> 31:41.900
like they're dragging their feet
on the Bo Bronson  sequel.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.776
No, they're gonna
make the movie.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.070
They want to make the movie.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.988
Nick, can I talk to you
for a minute?

31:45.988 --> 31:48.490
- Do you mind, Tommy?
- No, not at all.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.997
A-list.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.128
What the fuck, Ray, I was right
in the middle of my flow.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.628
- Yeah.
- Okay, you can't just--

32:06.550 --> 32:07.843
What the fuck?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.554
Hi, cutie.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.474
What the hell
is he doing here?

32:13.474 --> 32:17.728
You want Tommy, you're gonna
have to give up Sherman Radley.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.396
Give him up?
Give him up to who?

32:19.396 --> 32:23.567
To the fucking DA's office,
you cocksucker...

32:23.567 --> 32:25.152
for Fiona Miller's murder.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.570
Remember that?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.113
[Lowell scoffs]

32:29.615 --> 32:31.158
Go fuck yourself.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.993
Tommy Wheeler's not worth
that much.

32:32.993 --> 32:34.953
Hey, Nick...

32:34.953 --> 32:37.999
just fucking tell us
where her body is, huh?

32:41.502 --> 32:42.753
[scoffs]

32:44.505 --> 32:47.132
What, you're gonna
fucking shoot me?

32:47.132 --> 32:49.301
That's the idea, yeah.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.470
Okay, pal,

32:51.470 --> 32:53.889
I am the co-chair
of the motherfucking

32:53.889 --> 32:55.641
Motion Picture Department
at ACA.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.018
Fuck you.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.269
Co-chair, huh?

32:59.269 --> 33:01.397
[grunts]

33:01.397 --> 33:03.190
Oh, God!

33:05.151 --> 33:07.945
Fuck!

33:07.945 --> 33:10.531
Did you really just let
this fucking asshole punch me

33:10.531 --> 33:13.034
with this fucking face?

33:13.034 --> 33:15.327
No, he did that
on his own.

33:16.954 --> 33:20.208
[scoffs]
Are you really okay with this?

33:21.083 --> 33:24.002
Oh, done.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.963
You are so fucking done, Ray.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.631
I mean, do you have
any fucking idea

33:27.631 --> 33:29.842
how fast I can end
your whole fucking world?

33:29.842 --> 33:31.135
Right.

33:31.135 --> 33:33.470
[grunt]

33:33.470 --> 33:36.099
[laughs]

33:36.099 --> 33:38.225
Well, I don't know about you,
but this feels--

33:38.225 --> 33:39.810
this feels pretty nice.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.188
What?

33:42.188 --> 33:44.356
You and me working
together like this.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.899
[chuckles]

33:45.899 --> 33:47.359
You're out of your fucking mind,
you know that?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.153
All right, you don't
have to admit it,

33:49.153 --> 33:52.364
but I think you're feeling
kind of close to me right now.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.575
I'm gonna get a bucket.

33:54.575 --> 33:58.204
Don't let him bleed
on my rug.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.831
[Cochran] Okay, here's
what's gonna happen, Nick--

34:00.831 --> 34:02.624
your brain's gonna tell you
that you're drowning,

34:02.624 --> 34:05.419
and you kind of will be
really drowning,

34:05.419 --> 34:07.045
so you're gonna start
to believe it.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.214
Basically, this is
all the fun of drowning

34:09.214 --> 34:11.175
without having to leave
the dock.

34:11.175 --> 34:13.261
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you.

34:13.261 --> 34:15.554
This is going to really,
really suck,

34:15.554 --> 34:18.390
so my advice to you is
to tell us

34:18.390 --> 34:22.186
who took care of Fiona's body
right now.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.353
Hmm?

34:23.353 --> 34:24.646
Fuck  you!

34:24.646 --> 34:26.857
Defiance. Defiance.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.277
That's an extraordinarily
stupid attitude.

34:29.277 --> 34:31.612
But I like it.
I really do.

34:31.612 --> 34:32.821
Hey, did they teach you that

34:32.821 --> 34:34.740
at those douche-bag
company retreats

34:34.740 --> 34:37.160
you guys always take?

34:37.160 --> 34:40.163
[choking and grunting]

34:41.205 --> 34:43.123
Mm-hmm.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.500
[grunts]

34:44.500 --> 34:45.501
Okay.

34:45.501 --> 34:48.504
[muffled yelling]

34:48.504 --> 34:50.047
You like that?
