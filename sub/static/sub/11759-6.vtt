WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.960
Before Danny died, he
tried to say something.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.960
Now I reckon what he said was "list".

00:06.000 --> 00:08.539
Got a firearm in here, no-one enter.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.960
Investigating former Chief
Superintendant Patrick Fairbank

00:13.000 --> 00:15.060
in respect of not adequately investigating

00:15.099 --> 00:17.660
complaints of child sexual exploitation.

00:17.699 --> 00:20.940
The things they did to us at Sands View...

00:21.000 --> 00:22.440
It's OK.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.940
Ma'am, I'm requesting authorisation
on an undercover operation.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.879
It would be against a
fellow AC-12 officer.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.960
DI Cottan set me up.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.960
As far as the rope goes, he must
have planted it there beforehand.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.960
What happened with the postmortem?
Weren't you supposed to organise it?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.960
He knew forensics hadn't
bothered testing the envelope.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.399
I don't want to get caught
between you and DI Cottan.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.960
The Caddy is male, under 35.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.939
A detective, a London
or South East accent.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Sorry, gaffer, but the finger
is pointing at one of our own.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.960
I have a number of concerns regarding

01:02.000 --> 01:03.960
DS Arnott's professional conduct.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.959
He's been bearing a
firearm around the office.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.939
I have signed the firearm back in.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.939
I am innocent, the question is... are you?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.960
He's been accused of having
an improper relationship

01:15.000 --> 01:16.960
with a suspect, of planting
evidence against said suspect.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.960
I did not plant evidence!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.960
We agree the best course
of action is for you to be

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
suspended from duty until
these matters can be addressed.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
SIM Card? It's all in there.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
The incriminating item I've got
on you, that's my only insurance.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.939
I need to know you've
got my back. God, yeah.

01:43.979 --> 01:44.960
He's hiding summat.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.939
That lead on Steve, it looks
like it's going to pan out.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.939
He really did plant that money on Lindsay.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.960
There's no list here, Steve.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.400
If there's not, Lindsay is
going to get what's coming.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.959
'I thought it was Steve's car,
until I saw the registration.'

02:02.000 --> 02:03.959
I found Danny Waldron's list.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.959
It didn't make sense for
Danny to make a hard copy

02:06.000 --> 02:08.960
of the original list that
could be lost or destroyed.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.960
He would make an online copy.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.939
The VIPs who were abusing
boys at Sands View.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
100 grand and you forget about
all of this, that list included.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Why don't you just take the money?!
Because I'm a police officer!

02:31.000 --> 02:35.939
Do not send that message. Let's
see what they will think...

02:36.000 --> 02:38.139
when I bring in The Caddy.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.000 --> 02:54.340
How long is this going to take?

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
Patrick Fairbank,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.960
some new information has come to
light that we'd like to put to you.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.939
PC Bindra.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.939
Document 27 is a transcript
of a professional tribunal

03:11.000 --> 03:13.960
which took place on the
19th of September 1998,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.939
in which Oliver Stephens-Lloyd recorded

03:17.000 --> 03:18.960
he had submitted a list of
names of abusers at Sands View.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.939
Oh, not this list again.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.599
I don't know anything about any list.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Where is this new information?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I think we're done.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.960
Actually, if you would just
keep your seat, please.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I think we are about to hear
some new evidence, thank you.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
For the tape, DC Fleming
has joined the interview.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
Kate.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.960
For the tape, I am showing the
interviewee a video capture,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.939
item KMF-4.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.139
Who is shown in item KMF-4?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.960
I refused to take part in
any video identification.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.960
You did, which meant we were forced to use

04:11.000 --> 04:12.960
a video capture from
your previous interview.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.939
And we are legally
entitled to use this image

04:16.000 --> 04:17.959
because your client was
notified that he was going to be

04:18.000 --> 04:22.939
questioned regarding an offence
-- misconduct in public office.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.939
In accordance with paragraph five, Code D

04:26.000 --> 04:28.959
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act, item KMF-4,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.939
alongside eight other video captures

04:32.000 --> 04:33.959
of unrelated, similar persons were shown

04:34.000 --> 04:36.959
by an officer independent
of this inquiry to a witness

04:37.000 --> 04:40.939
who was a resident at Sands
View Boys' Home in the 1990s.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.939
This witness identified KMF-4
as showing one of the men

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
who sexually abused him.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.939
These politicians and celebrities,
they couldn't have got away with

04:54.000 --> 04:58.939
this time and time again without
the collusion of police officers.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.959
I mean, I kept asking
myself over and over again,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.939
how could they turn a blind eye,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.939
how could they allow these appalling
things to happen to these children?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.939
And of course, the
answer is as plain as day.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
They didn't turn a blind
eye, they were in on it!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm going to take this.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.139
This is a list of abusers.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.899
Corroborating the names we've
already heard from our witness.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Ronan Murphy, Linus Murphy...

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
.. Dale Roach, Tommy Hunter...

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
.. and Patrick Fairbank.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.939
Patrick Fairbank, I am arresting
you for aggravated indecent assault,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
in that this offence occurred
before May the 1st 2004...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.939
.. with a child or children...

06:17.000 --> 06:18.939
under the age of 13...

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
.. perverting the course of justice
and misconduct in public office.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.199
Sir.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Well done.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.879
Well done, yourself.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.399
Custody arranged at Polk Avenue.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.939
You think you got me?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.959
You haven't got a clue. I
hope you like the outdoors

07:08.000 --> 07:10.939
because you are going
to be directing traffic

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
to the end of your sad little career.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.939
Bitch.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
'This is Lindsay Denton. Please
leave a message after the tone.'

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Shit!

08:21.000 --> 08:25.939
DS Arnott. Need to report the
theft of my service vehicle. Taxi!

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah, 5... 5 Kings Gate Apartments. Yeah.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
DS Arnott. I need the key
to Lindsay Denton's room.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.600
Mother of God.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.960
'This is Lindsay Denton. Please
leave a message after the tone.'

09:55.000 --> 09:59.200
I know you nicked my pocketbook,
and I don't know where you are...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.940
Police! Armed police!

10:07.000 --> 10:08.960
I'm AC-12! Don't move! I'm AC-12!

10:09.000 --> 10:12.940
You! Keep your hands above
your head. Down on your knees.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.960
Just calm down, I'm police.
Stop talking and stay still!

10:16.000 --> 10:17.960
My ID's in my jacket, I'm AC-12.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.940
Stop talking and stay still!

10:21.000 --> 10:22.679
Lose the phone.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.940
Get everyone out. All right, everyone out!

10:31.000 --> 10:32.799
Got the wrong guy.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.679
All clear, sir!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Dot?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.960
Steven Arnott, I'm arresting you

10:51.000 --> 10:52.960
on suspicion of murdering Lindsay Denton.

10:53.000 --> 10:53.960
You do not have to say anything

10:54.000 --> 10:56.960
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention, when questioned,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.960
something you later rely on in court.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.940
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.960
What's going on? You know. Keep your
mouth shut till you get a lawyer.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.879
I'm trying to do you a
favour. Get him out.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.940
DI Cottan, DS Arnott. You all
right to book him in for me?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.960
Need to take his clothes for forensics

11:40.000 --> 11:41.960
before he goes in his cell.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.960
Steven Arnott, I'm satisfied
that your arrest is lawful.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.940
I'm authorising your detention in
this police station in order that we

11:49.000 --> 11:51.960
can secure and preserve evidence
in this investigation, and to obtain

11:52.000 --> 11:55.940
evidence from you by questioning.
I will also speak to an inspector

11:56.000 --> 11:58.960
to authorise you being held
incommunicado at this time,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.960
delaying your right to have
anyone told you're here,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
or to make any calls.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.799
Do you understand?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.960
DS Arnott, can you account
for your whereabouts between

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
0800 and 1200 hours on
July 17th this year?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.940
I was at home.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.960
This would be your home address
-- Flat 5, Kings Gate Apartments?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.940
Yes.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Who were you with?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.399
Between those hours I was alone.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.960
And your girlfriend, DS
Samantha Railston, where was she?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.940
Sam left early for work.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.940
Around 0630.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.960
I was alone in the flat
but I made phone calls.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.139
They'll prove where I was.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.960
Document 3 in your folders.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.940
Document 3 is a photocopy
of item reference ASJ-3,

12:53.000 --> 13:00.940
telecommunications record for
mobile phone 07591152425,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.960
registered to Steven Arnott.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.940
Three calls are shown.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.299
Can you tell us what was
happening with these calls?

13:10.000 --> 13:13.940
I'd realised Lindsay had
stolen my pocketbook.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.960
I called her from my flat, but
it went straight to her voicemail.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.960
I went to her approved premises
to try and track her down

13:20.000 --> 13:22.960
but she wasn't there, so I
tried calling her again.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.960
And the call to the AC-12 switchboard?

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
To report the theft of my
service vehicle. Thank you.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
When was the last time you
saw Lindsay Denton alive?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.940
The night before. My flat.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.940
Lindsay had a theory
that Danny Waldron left

13:42.000 --> 13:43.960
a list of abusers in a graveyard.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.960
We were searching online
burial records for a name that

13:46.000 --> 13:48.960
might have been a memorable
association for Danny.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.960
She left my flat and I went
to the graveyard alone.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.960
Must have been while she was in my
flat that she took my pocketbook.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.960
At this time, myself and DI
Cottan were carrying out direct

13:58.000 --> 13:59.960
surveillance on Steve Arnott's flat,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.960
authorised by Superintendant Hastings,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.940
under the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000.

14:05.980 --> 14:06.960
Noted.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.960
We saw you and Lindsay split up.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.960
And after you'd left, she looked
like the cat who'd got the cream.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.960
She sent you off on a wild
goose chase while she went

14:15.000 --> 14:19.940
and cracked the case. Cos, actually,
Danny had hidden the list online.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.940
She found the list? She did indeed.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.960
You gotta hand it to her,
she got the job done.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.399
And she made a total mug of you.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.960
Now, these phone calls
we've been talking about,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.960
they're all around noon onwards.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
None of them corroborate you being
in your flat before that time.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.940
The proprietor of the internet caff,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.940
now, she reckons she saw Denton
leave around... 11, 11.30.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.960
She didn't see where
Denton went or who she met,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.960
and we've no information
on her whereabouts

14:51.000 --> 14:53.940
until her body was discovered at 12.30.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.960
But you were at home all this time?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Yes, sir. So what were
you doing all this time?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.940
DS Arnott? I slept.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.960
You had a kip? Seriously?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.960
I'd been up most of the night.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.960
You didn't think of
calling her straightaway?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.940
No, sir.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.960
She'd sent you to this
graveyard on a fool's errand,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.960
stolen your pocketbook.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.960
I'd have been after her like a shot.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
You, you're stuck to your sofa
watching Homes Under The Hammer.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.679
I got home late.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.940
Sam, my girlfriend, and I -- we had a row.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.940
I had some wine and I fell
asleep on the sofa. I overslept.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.960
As soon as I realised my
pocketbook was gone, I took action.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.960
Still, you were sorely pissed
off with her, weren't you?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.960
DS Arnott is simply stating
the facts. Oh, right.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.940
So you weren't pissed off with her?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.960
In the early hours of the 17th,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.960
I followed Mr Arnott to the
graveyard of St Barnabas Church.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.940
In which he stated,

15:56.000 --> 15:57.960
"If there's no list here

15:58.000 --> 16:00.940
"then Lindsay's going
to get what's coming."

16:01.000 --> 16:04.940
Can you tell us what you
meant by those words?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.539
I was angry.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.960
Angry with Kate. Angry with Lindsay.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.960
I didn't MEAN anything.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.960
But you do admit that you
were angry with Lindsay?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.960
Those words go way beyond angry.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I didn't kill Lindsay.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.960
At her trial, Lindsay testified that

16:22.000 --> 16:24.940
there was a sexual
relationship between you.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.960
The relevant section for the
transcript is document 46.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.940
I don't need a transcript
-- she was lying.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.960
Data retrieval from Lindsay's mobile

16:32.000 --> 16:34.940
resulted in detection
of the following file --

16:35.000 --> 16:38.940
item reference MKJ-32.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
For the tape, I will now play MKJ-32.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.960
'Is that OK?'

16:48.000 --> 16:49.279
'Yeah.'

16:55.000 --> 16:56.399
'You OK?'

16:57.000 --> 16:58.960
'Yeah.'

17:06.000 --> 17:08.960
You recognise the voices
on this audio file?

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
Me and Lindsay. And can you tell
us where the recording was made?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.940
In her bedroom.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
And were you aware at the time
that this recording was being made?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.940
No, sir, I was not. As DS Arnott
didn't give his permission,

17:26.980 --> 17:27.960
the recording was illegal.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.940
Still... it's not a nice thing
to do to someone, though.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.960
Just another thing she did to put
a few more winds on your clock, eh?

17:36.000 --> 17:40.940
Time and time again you
denied any impropriety.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.960
What you can't know is that
we're both almost fully clothed

17:43.000 --> 17:45.960
and the file's been abridged.
If you'd had the opportunity

17:46.000 --> 17:47.960
to continue listening you'd have heard

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
that we stopped through
mutual consent. Stopped? What?

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
There was some kissing. Some touching.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.940
Lindsay became upset and I comforted
her. Sir, I give you my word,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.940
Lindsay Denton and I did not have sex.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.940
Your word.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.960
Whatever your version
is of that audio file,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.960
it sounds like you pair went
way beyond the professional.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.960
And then she used it to
discredit your case against her.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.960
Now, I don't know many blokes who
wouldn't be angry about that.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.940
And thanks to her accusations
you are suspended, your career

18:23.000 --> 18:24.880
potentially in ruins.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.940
Now, for the tape -- on screen is image 5.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.940
Image 5 is a crime scene photograph
taken at 12.45 on July 17th,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.940
showing the body of Lindsay Denton.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.940
Image 8.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.960
That's my car. Image 8 is a crime
scene photograph showing the vehicle

18:43.000 --> 18:45.940
in which Lindsay Denton's body was found.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.940
It's a dark grey Volvo S60.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
You agree it's your car?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.940
As I've said, sir, I
reported my vehicle stolen.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.960
Document 6 in your folders.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.940
Document 6 is a photocopy
of item reference IKL-1.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.940
IKL-1 is the log for service vehicles.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.940
On July 1st you signed out service
vehicle Foxtrot Juliet 1-4 Romeo

19:12.000 --> 19:14.960
Charlie Zulu, and it was
never signed back in.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.940
You should've. The
second you were suspended.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.960
It's a perk of the job. Didn't
want to give up the motor.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.940
So, it's a matter of fact that
this vehicle was in your possession

19:24.000 --> 19:26.960
at the time of the murder. The fact,
sir, is someone stole the vehicle.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.400
And you reported it stolen when?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.940
In the call made to the
AC-12 switchboard at 11.59.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.960
Yeah, but Lindsay was last seen
alive up to an hour earlier.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.960
At the internet caff. Now, that is
plenty of time for you to get home

19:39.000 --> 19:41.960
and report your car stolen. I reported
the theft as soon as I realised.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.599
The car must have been stolen earlier.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.279
I see.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.960
Document 7 is a copy of the
pathologist's report following

19:53.000 --> 19:55.940
a postmortem examination
of Lindsay Denton.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.940
The cause of death was a single
gunshot wound to the head.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.940
Image 6. Image 6 is a forensic
photograph of item reference NJC-4.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.960
Item NJC-4 is a bullet found
lodged in the passenger-side trim

20:09.000 --> 20:13.940
of service vehicle Foxtrot
Juliet 1-4 Romeo Charlie Zulu.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.940
NJC-4 has been identified as
a 9x19mm Parabellum round.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.940
Image 13.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.940
Image 13 shows item reference SCS-9.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.940
SCS-9 is a service-issue
firearm, Glock 17 pistol,

20:28.000 --> 20:32.940
serial number -- November
Mike 8-4-9-4-7-4-8.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.960
The Glock 17 was found a short
distance from the vehicle

20:36.000 --> 20:39.940
containing the body of Lindsay Denton.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.960
Document 11 in your
folders -- also on screen.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.940
Document 11 is the firearms issue
log from South Ferry armoury.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.940
You'll see a highlighted entry
on the morning of July 13th,

20:50.000 --> 20:55.940
relating to said Glock 17, serial
number November Mike 8-4-9-4-7-4-8.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.960
Said firearm was never returned.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.940
No. I returned my firearm a few
days before Lindsay was murdered.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.940
Not according to these records. No. No.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.960
I returned it. Ask them at the
armoury, they'll confirm it.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.940
It's here in black and white, son.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
You always follow the regs
when it comes to firearms?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.960
DS Arnott was seen bearing a firearm
within this building that did not,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.940
in my view, meet satisfactory
operational requirement.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.940
On July 13th I gave DS Arnott
a verbal warning that he was

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
in breach of Section 7
of the 1968 Firearms Act.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.960
What forensics do you have
linking me to the crime scene?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.940
Your car, your gun --
I'd say that's plenty.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.960
Were my fingerprints on the gun?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.960
There were no fingerprints
found on the firearm at all.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.960
It appeared to have been
wiped. Right. So no prints.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.960
Lindsay Denton was shot at close range.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.940
The vehicle interior shows a
substantial blood spatter pattern.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.940
Did you find blood particles on me?

21:57.000 --> 22:00.940
At the time of Steve Arnott's arrest, his
clothing was seized for forensic examination.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.960
There were no traces of blood
or gunshot residue detected.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.960
Yeah, but anyone with half
a brain, covered in blood

22:06.000 --> 22:08.960
and gunshot residue, would know
to dispose of his clothing.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.960
So where's this clothing? You tell us.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.940
Why would I shoot Lindsay in my own car?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.960
I know the forensics would be
totally incriminating. Correct.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.960
They are. So I wouldn't have done it!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.960
You were at the end of your
tether with Lindsay Denton.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.960
She betrayed you, manipulated
you, deceived you and, finally,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.960
she discredited you. You
weren't thinking straight!

22:25.000 --> 22:27.960
So I used my service-issue
firearm that I left at the scene?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.940
And I used my registered service
vehicle? I mean, that's just stupid!

22:32.000 --> 22:33.960
You panicked. You left
your bullet and the casing

22:34.000 --> 22:35.960
and you didn't do a good
enough job disposing of the gun.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.960
Then you cobble together some story
about your motor being nicked.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.960
In fact, the only thing
you didn't make a hash of

22:41.000 --> 22:42.960
was the bloodstained clothing.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.079
That's not what happened.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.940
Image 22 shows item reference EDC-3,
found in said service vehicle.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.960
Can you tell us what item EDC-3 is?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.940
My pocketbook.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.960
And is that the one stolen
by Lindsay? Yes, sir.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.940
So you went after her to get it
back... things got out of hand

23:04.000 --> 23:06.960
and in your panic you didn't
even remember to take it.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.960
I didn't take it because I wasn't there!

23:09.000 --> 23:12.940
So you've said. Is there anyone
-- anyone -- that we can talk to

23:13.000 --> 23:14.960
who will bear witness to
the fact you were at home

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
during the time of
Lindsay Denton's murder?

23:23.000 --> 23:26.940
I had my issues with Lindsay
Denton, I can't deny that.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.740
But I wouldn't kill her. So you've said.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.940
I didn't have that gun.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
So if I didn't return it, why
didn't anyone try and recover it?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
DS Arnott's asked a
very important question.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.960
Yes, well, I admit there was
a failure to do due diligence

23:49.000 --> 23:50.960
on the part of the officers
at South Ferry armoury,

23:51.000 --> 23:52.960
but I've written to the
Strategic Firearms Commander

23:53.000 --> 23:55.960
making my feelings on the
matter abundantly clear

23:56.000 --> 23:57.960
and I can assure you,
disciplinary action...

23:58.000 --> 24:00.960
No-one realised because I
HAD returned the firearm!

24:01.000 --> 24:03.960
Someone must have access to the
booking-out forms and replaced

24:04.000 --> 24:06.960
the real one -- the one showing
I surrendered the gun --

24:07.000 --> 24:09.960
with a forgery. Yeah, but this same
someone would had to have signed out

24:10.000 --> 24:11.960
the same gun that was
used in the murder --

24:12.000 --> 24:13.960
and where's the record of
that? It's the same thing,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.960
sir -- stolen so no-one can
track who's got the weapon.

24:17.000 --> 24:17.960
All right, let me get this straight.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.940
What you're saying is that some
impostor acquired the firearm

24:22.000 --> 24:24.960
and then tampered with the paperwork
to cover his tracks. Yes, sir.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.960
Obviously the same person who stole
my service vehicle that morning.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.940
So your defence is,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.960
"It wasn't me, it was
just some random impostor"?

24:32.000 --> 24:32.960
No, not random.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.940
To know it's extremely difficult
to steal a service-issue firearm

24:37.000 --> 24:38.960
but not actually all that
difficult to fake the paperwork --

24:39.000 --> 24:41.960
that takes inside knowledge. This
was done by a police officer.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.960
But apparently it's a piece of cake
to steal a service-issue vehicle

24:45.000 --> 24:48.940
fitted with deadlocks and an immobiliser.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I have to say, this is all
sounding a bit far-fetched, son.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.940
There's a parallel on this case, sir.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.960
Ever since we started
investigating Danny Waldron --

25:05.000 --> 25:07.960
first his shooting of Ronan
Murphy, then Danny's murder --

25:08.000 --> 25:10.960
there have been holes that the
evidence hasn't completely filled,

25:11.000 --> 25:12.960
one of which is the
murder of PC Rod Kennedy.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.960
Sir, this is a massive tangent.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.960
DS Arnott knows we have to charge or
release and he's playing for time.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.960
Sir, DI Cottan was too quick
to close the investigation

25:21.000 --> 25:23.960
into Kennedy's murder, just like he
was with his inquiry into The Caddy.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.960
He's doing the same thing here.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.960
He's cutting corners, not
challenging evidence robustly,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.940
and I'm the one suffering
for his negligence!

25:31.000 --> 25:33.960
Sir, DS Arnott's casting aspersions
for one reason and one reason only --

25:34.000 --> 25:35.960
to discredit this case,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.960
to get AC-12 taken off the
investigation against him.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.960
It's what these coppers do when you
know you've got 'em bang to rights --

25:42.000 --> 25:44.960
exploit their knowledge of the
system to try and tie us in knots.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.960
Look, I'd be really grateful if
we could just stick to the issue

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
in hand here, which is the
murder of Lindsay Denton.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.940
Thank you, sir.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.960
Now, with respect to service
vehicle Foxtrot Juliet 1-4 Romeo

25:59.000 --> 26:02.940
Charlie Zulu, a forensic search was
carried out at the crime scene.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.940
Image 43. Interior of
service vehicle boot.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.940
Image 45. Image 45 is
item reference VCT-7.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.960
Do you recognise VCT-7?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.940
My gym bag.

26:16.980 --> 26:17.960
Image 46.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.940
Image 46 shows the contents

26:21.000 --> 26:24.940
of VCT-7 -- sports clothing and trainers.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.940
Image 47 -- That was not in my bag!

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
What...?! What is going on
here?! DS Arnott, please.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.940
Image 47...

26:36.000 --> 26:37.960
shows item reference VCT-9.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.940
VCT-9 is an unregistered
pay-as-you-go mobile phone.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.960
Your phone, DS Arnott? No, sir!

26:44.000 --> 26:46.400
No, sir, someone put that there.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.940
VCT-9 is a phone of the type
reportedly associated with

26:52.000 --> 26:54.960
covert criminal communications.
That is not my phone.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.960
What the hell is it doing in your gym bag?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.960
DS Arnott denies any knowledge
of the phone, there's clearly some

27:00.000 --> 27:02.960
irregularity with the search. My
department carries out its searches

27:03.000 --> 27:04.960
to the letter of the law, fella!

27:05.000 --> 27:06.940
The letter!

27:07.000 --> 27:09.940
Document 19 in your folders.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.940
For the tape,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.960
this is a partial transcript
of Lindsay Denton's retrial.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.960
At Lindsay Denton's first trial
she was convicted of conspiracy

27:18.000 --> 27:20.960
to murder, and the prosecution
hung on crucial evidence

27:21.000 --> 27:24.940
found at her home address, namely
50 grand in cash that was linked

27:25.000 --> 27:28.940
via financial forensics to other
bribes employed in the conspiracy.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.140
I didn't plant that money.

27:32.960 --> 27:33.960
Image 49.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.940
Image 49 shows item reference VCT-11.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Now, VCT-11 is a? 5 note.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.880
Is that your? 5 note?

27:44.000 --> 27:46.940
I don't remember having
any money in the bag.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.960
Not your phone, now it's
not your money either.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.960
I'm saying I don't recall if I
was carrying any money in the bag.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.940
Fair enough.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.960
That was in the inside pocket.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.940
It's only a fiver. It's easy to forget.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.940
We ran forensics on that? 5 note.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.940
Document 20 in your folders.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.940
DC Fleming.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.960
For the tape, I'm
referring to document 20.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.960
Document 20 is a photocopy
of an original report

28:13.000 --> 28:15.940
made by the financial forensics unit.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.940
Report Sierra Alpha/56-57/1-5.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.940
The summary reads --

28:23.000 --> 28:26.940
"Pollen particles detected on
banknote VCT-11 show a close match

28:27.000 --> 28:31.940
"to pollen particles detected
on banknotes AJK-72."

28:32.000 --> 28:34.940
AJK-72 is the item
reference for the? 50,000

28:35.000 --> 28:37.960
found at Lindsay Denton's
home. There is no way!

28:38.000 --> 28:38.960
Look, just...

28:39.000 --> 28:41.960
That is not my money! A second
ago you couldn't even remember.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.960
There is no way that I'd have
money that was from the same source

28:45.000 --> 28:45.960
as Lindsay Denton's bribe!

28:46.000 --> 28:47.960
But Lindsay Denton knew
you planted that evidence,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.960
and she was your most vociferous accuser.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.960
So maybe she was onto this evidence,
too. She wasn't onto any evidence!

28:53.000 --> 28:55.960
She couldn't have known about this!
Oh, right, so you hid it from her?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.960
I didn't mean it like that. That
money would be very hard to come by.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.960
But together with the phone
this indicates a clear

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
pattern of corrupt conduct. I am not bent!

29:12.000 --> 29:13.960
This is obviously a very...

29:14.000 --> 29:15.960
difficult experience, Steve.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.940
Would you like some time
alone with your solicitor?

29:19.980 --> 29:20.960
No.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.940
Very well, but can we
all just calm down here

29:24.000 --> 29:26.940
and not let our emotions
get the better of us?

29:26.980 --> 29:27.960
Sir.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.940
So, moving on.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.940
In respect of another murder,
that of Sergeant Daniel Waldron,

29:34.000 --> 29:37.940
have you any comment to make?
Waldron was murdered by Hari Bains.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.940
Bains confessed and
intends to plead guilty.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.960
Yeah, well, Bains owed gambling
debts to the wrong people.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.940
And we believe they contracted
him to kill Waldron. Indeed.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.940
Significantly, Bains received a
call the night of the 31st of May

29:52.000 --> 29:55.940
from a phone of the
type found in your car.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.960
Night before he shot and
killed Danny Waldron.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.960
According to Bains, in a
statement made on June 30th,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
the caller had a London/South East accent.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.940
So? So, was that you?
London and South East

30:12.000 --> 30:14.960
have such small populations,
it could only have been me(!)

30:15.000 --> 30:16.960
Kindly just answer the
question, please, DS Arnott.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.960
Bains and I met loads of times. He
would have known my voice and been

30:20.000 --> 30:23.940
able to identify, the call was clearly
made by another person unknown.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.960
Yes, and you're familiar with the
putative corrupt police officer

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
codename The Caddy?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.200
I am.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
DI Cottan. Sir.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.960
Assimilation of all credible witness
testimony, based on direct contact

30:49.000 --> 30:52.940
with said individual, leads
to the following profile.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.940
The Caddy is male.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.960
The Caddy is almost certainly
from a working-class background

30:58.000 --> 30:59.960
and grew up in an urban environment.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.940
Is probably under 35.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.940
He is almost certainly a detective.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.960
He's trained in covert operations
such as counterterrorism.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.960
And all earwitnesses report
The Caddy as having a London

31:11.000 --> 31:13.940
or South East accent.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.940
This is insane.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.940
God help me, son, I wish it was. Sir!

31:19.000 --> 31:22.940
That's your evidence? A profile?
We've more than just a profile.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.960
Only The Caddy would have had access
to the same source of bribe money

31:26.000 --> 31:27.960
found at Lindsay Denton's house.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
The same supply we found some
of in your service vehicle boot.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Would you like some more time, DS Arnott?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.940
No.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.960
DI Cottan originally volunteered
to investigate The Caddy

31:55.000 --> 31:56.960
and closed the case prematurely,
based on flimsy evidence

31:57.000 --> 31:58.960
provided by an old colleague.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.960
Yes, but we're not here
to discuss DI Cottan.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.940
Sir, he's just looking at some
angles to try and discredit this...

32:05.000 --> 32:07.740
I intend to be heard, sir. On the record.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.279
Very well. That's your right.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.940
DI Cottan, you carried out the
original inquiry into The Caddy.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.960
I did. That wrongly identified
DC Jeremy Cole. Yes.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.960
Based purely on the testimony
of your former colleague,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.960
DC Nigel Morton. Yeah, but Morton
has since revised his statement.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
DI Cottan and DC Fleming are
reopening that particular inquiry.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.960
You also failed to order a
second postmortem on the body

32:40.000 --> 32:42.960
of Rod Kennedy. My e-mail
bounced back, as well you know.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.960
Sir, he's clutching at straws here.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.960
In respect of the original
inquiry into the murder

32:47.000 --> 32:49.960
of Sergeant Danny Waldron, you
led a search of Waldron's flat.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.960
I did. And as part of that
search you found an envelope

32:52.000 --> 32:54.960
addressed to me. Yes. And the
forensics that you failed to

32:55.000 --> 32:57.960
carry out on the inside of that
envelope detected traces of ink

32:58.000 --> 33:00.960
and blood, suggesting it contained
a note written by Danny Waldron

33:01.000 --> 33:02.960
and PRESUMABLY intended for me.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.960
No note was ever found. Danny
Waldron saved his list online.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.960
Which we only discovered weeks later
cos you failed to pursue this lead!

33:09.000 --> 33:11.960
I did not. The note had
been in that envelope!

33:12.000 --> 33:14.539
That's not what was in the envelope!

33:21.000 --> 33:23.940
Item reference MRC-1.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.940
Item reference MRC-1 is the envelope
recovered from Danny Waldron's flat.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.940
And for the tape, Mr Arnott is quite
correct -- it does bear his name.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.960
Item reference MRC-2 is the
contents of the envelope.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.960
This item was entered
into evidence separately,

33:39.000 --> 33:39.960
for reasons of internal security.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.960
You will see in your folders
document appendix 1 refers to

33:43.000 --> 33:44.940
sequestered evidence.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.960
Sequestration of evidence
authorised by Gill Bigelow,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
leading legal council to
Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.400
This is what was in the envelope.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.960
Now, for the tape, I'm showing Mr
Arnott the sequestered evidence --

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
a white golf tee.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.940
Steve Arnott.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.400
Golf tee.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
I think Danny Waldron was
trying to tell us something.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
Have you got anything
further to add, DS Arnott?

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
For the tape, the interviewee
is shaking his head.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.940
Steven Arnott,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.960
you will remain under arrest for
the murder of Lindsay Denton.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.960
I will now seek guidance from
the Crown Prosecutor as to how

34:53.000 --> 34:54.960
to charge you for said offence.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.940
You will be taken to a place of custody.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.960
If you're not charged within
24 hours of the original arrest

35:01.000 --> 35:03.940
you will be released, however I...

35:04.000 --> 35:06.960
will seek the authority
for a 12-hour extension.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.960
Is all this understood?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.940
Yes, sir.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Interview discontinued.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
God help me if I ever get
a good night's sleep again.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.940
DI Cottan...

35:53.000 --> 35:54.960
my office, five minutes.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.199
Sir.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
You OK?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.960
That can't have been easy.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.400
Well done.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Sorry.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.960
Just when exactly did you get the
idea of sequestering evidence from me?

36:42.000 --> 36:45.940
Hm? In 35 years, this has been
my worst day in the service,

36:46.000 --> 36:47.960
and now this little incident
just about caps the whole lot!

36:48.000 --> 36:52.940
Was it your idea to go behind
my back or was it yours?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.940
To be fair to DI Cottan, he
sought me out for guidance.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.960
It was my decision to sequester the
evidence from Danny Waldron's flat

37:00.000 --> 37:03.940
because of its sensitive nature
in regard to a fellow officer.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.960
It seemed a bizarre and
possibly meaningless find, sir,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.940
but I just had a feeling... "Feeling"?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.960
.. that it might alert
Steve. And if it had of done

37:13.000 --> 37:15.960
then we wouldn't have had
all this other evidence.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.960
Oh, yeah, you're on very
thin ice with me, DI Cottan.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.940
Are there any other surprises in store?

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
I hope not, sir. I hope not, too.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.940
Dismissed!

37:28.000 --> 37:29.199
Sir.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.960
At the time, neither DI Cottan nor I
knew if the golf tee was relevant.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.940
Clearly, recent events have created
a more significant context. Clearly!

37:45.000 --> 37:48.940
I can see you're angry, Ted, but the
fact that you personally recruited

37:49.000 --> 37:50.960
Steve Arnott did weigh on my decision.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.960
What, you decided I was going to be
biased? I'm sorry, but at the time

37:54.000 --> 37:56.960
it felt like the right decision.
Now, can we just calm down?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
I am calm! I'm totally bloody calm!

38:03.000 --> 38:05.940
Look, I know this is abysmal timing

38:06.000 --> 38:08.960
but former Chief Superintendant
Patrick Fairbank's legal team

38:09.000 --> 38:11.960
are applying for the child sex
abuse charges to be dropped.

38:12.000 --> 38:12.960
What?

38:13.000 --> 38:15.960
They're saying that he repeatedly
stated in his interviews that,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.940
"I'm not as sharp as I used to
be." Yeah, I know he said that.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.960
They're saying that an independent
physician should have examined

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
his intellectual fitness for interview.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.940
They're having his GP attest
he's got senile dementia.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.940
He isn't fit to stand trial.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.599
Mother of God.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.960
DS Arnott has to be
charged or released today.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Don't delay your call
to the Crown Prosecutor.

38:46.960 --> 38:47.960
Fine.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.400
Thank you.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.940
Superintendant Hastings for the
Senior Crime Prosecutor, please.

40:57.980 --> 40:58.960
Hastings.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.280
That's right, like the battle.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Come in. Sir.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.480
Anything to avoid making this call.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.960
Listen, sir, before you
call the Crown Prosecutor,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.960
there's some things we need to discuss.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.940
This is a favour to her, not you.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Two minutes.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.880
It's good to see you.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.139
Is there anything I can do?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.940
You can say you don't
believe a word of it.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.940
Of course I don't.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.940
Sam...

41:55.000 --> 41:57.280
My DCI's got me on desk duty.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.960
She asked me outright if
I was in on it with you.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.940
I'm innocent.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.539
Yeah, I know.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.679
Well, you came.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.400
I'm glad.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.940
I'm sorry about the flat being
closed for forensics. It's fine.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.960
I'm at a friend's place.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
They've gotta release me in a few
hours, so we can be back in soon.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Steve...

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Sorry.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
So which one were you looking at?
Which one were you...? That...

43:07.000 --> 43:10.940
You still haven't charged Steve
Arnott. We need more time.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.960
I know it's difficult going
after one of your own...

43:13.000 --> 43:15.940
It's what we do for a living.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.960
DC Fleming has caused me

43:18.000 --> 43:19.960
to want to re-examine the
evidence against Steve Arnott.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.940
Come on, Ted, there's
a mountain of evidence.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.940
His gun. The car. The money. The threat.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.940
Motive, opportunity, means.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.960
During the interview with
Steven Arnott I indentified

43:33.000 --> 43:35.960
a number of issues that
merit further examination.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.940
Of course you want to believe that
Steve's innocent. Of course you do.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.940
But you're jumping to rash and
extremely damaging conclusions.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.940
DC Fleming, please.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.960
Miss Bigelow, you do
not have to say anything

43:48.000 --> 43:50.960
but it may harm your defence
if you do not... Excuse me.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.940
Gill, please, this is necessary.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.960
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

43:57.000 --> 43:58.960
if you do not mention, when questioned,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.960
something you later rely on in court.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.960
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.960
It's been a long day and
night, let's get a grip, Ted.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.960
Did you furnish Superintendant
Hastings with an intelligence file

44:09.000 --> 44:10.960
relating to Ronan Murphy,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
the suspect shot dead by Sergeant
Danny Waldron on the 13th of May?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.940
I did. And from who did
you obtain that file?

44:19.000 --> 44:20.940
"Whom."

44:21.000 --> 44:22.960
It was supplied to me in confidence

44:23.000 --> 44:25.960
and to reveal the source would
be a betrayal of that confidence.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.960
Gill, you're under caution.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
It would help us enormously if
you could provide an answer.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Very well. Show her.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.960
This is a signed authority from
Superintendant Summers at AC-3

44:47.000 --> 44:49.960
for me to conduct an undercover
operation against AC-12 officers.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.960
I see what it is. When did this happen?
I only found about this this evening.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.960
Under said authority, I
obtained evidence that this file

44:56.000 --> 44:59.940
originated from DS Nicola
Rogerson at Major Violent Crime.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.960
In a written statement, DS
Rogerson claims that the file was

45:03.000 --> 45:08.940
"requested" by an AC-12 officer.
Did an AC-12 officer furnish you

45:09.000 --> 45:11.739
with this file on condition of anonymity?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.199
Yes.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.940
DS Rogerson's copy of the file
did not contain the omissions

45:19.000 --> 45:20.960
made to the one you received.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.960
I was given that file in good faith

45:23.000 --> 45:25.940
and I completely deny tampering with it.

45:25.980 --> 45:26.960
No-one's suggesting you did.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.940
What we're exploring here
is that the alterations

45:31.000 --> 45:34.940
were made by said AC-12 officer.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
Now, can you confirm the name
we've heard from Rogerson?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.199
Fine.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.940
He brought you the golf tee...

45:57.000 --> 46:00.940
so we assumed that he would
have brought you file, good.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
DC Fleming, would you kindly
excuse us for a moment, please?

46:09.000 --> 46:10.679
Thank you, Kate.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.960
You're barking up the wrong tree.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.940
Matthew Cottan has done a first-rate
job of rooting out a bad apple.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.960
Gill... As for the file, he
knew we were being obstructed,

46:30.000 --> 46:31.960
so he obtained it through
unofficial channels.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.960
Why didn't he just give it to me?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.960
Because he was afraid you'd give him

46:36.000 --> 46:39.940
a dressing-down for
acting improperly. Gill...

46:40.000 --> 46:41.960
even after the time we spent together,

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
you really don't know me at all.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.960
This is a video capture taken
from a traffic camera situated

46:57.000 --> 46:59.960
on the Kings Gate Expressway showing
traffic at the time indicated

47:00.000 --> 47:01.960
in the top right-hand corner.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.940
9.46. Steve's car.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.199
At first glance, yes, but...

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
Different reg.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.940
Correct. Here are more
traffic camera images,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.940
this same vehicle captured
travelling through the city centre

47:16.000 --> 47:18.940
on traffic cameras a few minutes apart.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
Image enhancement has failed
to show who's driving.

47:23.960 --> 47:24.960
Now, here's a street map.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.960
This street map shows the
locations of the vehicle at times

47:28.000 --> 47:31.940
corresponding to the exact times
of the traffic camera images.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.960
I'm now going to add the location
of the internet cafe where

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Lindsay Denton was last
seen alive that morning.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.940
Someone was driving the vehicle to
Lindsay's location that morning.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.940
Yeah. And previous to the internet
cafe, Lindsay Denton was last seen

47:47.000 --> 47:48.960
at her approved premises the night before.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.940
I'm now going to add the location
of the approved premises.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.960
There's an hour's delay in the
timeline of the vehicle's movements,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.940
suggesting it hung around the
approved premises during this time.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
So... Lindsay was followed
to the internet cafe.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.960
Looks like it, sir. And
correct me if I'm wrong,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.960
but this is the same time that
Steve said that he was home alone?

48:11.000 --> 48:11.960
Yeah, that's correct, sir.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.940
Steve doesn't have an alibi so it
could be him driving that vehicle.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.940
Hmm. One final thing.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.960
I've indentified this registration

48:21.000 --> 48:24.940
as belonging to another
make and model entirely.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.940
They're fake plates.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.960
Well done. Well done. I think
you'd better get that wee one home,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
and thanks very much for coming in.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.940
Why would Steve be driving
his own car with fake plates?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.940
To hide his movements?

48:49.000 --> 48:50.960
It doesn't make sense, sir, she
wouldn't have got in the car.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.960
If Steve turned up with
fake plates she'd have known

48:54.000 --> 48:55.960
he was up to something.
She would never get in.

48:56.000 --> 48:56.960
Or maybe she just didn't see it.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.940
We all know Lindsay, sir, she
never missed a thing. Hm.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Sorry, Kate, you couldn't give us
a hand with the lift? Yeah, sure.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.940
Off the record,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.960
DI Cottan put pressure on me not
to tell Steve about the additional

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
forensics on the envelope
found in Danny Waldron's flat.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.679
Cheers, Maneet.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.940
He's here, sir. And?

49:48.000 --> 49:50.480
Well, I can't say he's very happy.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
DC Morton, would you mind coming with us?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.940
DC Morton.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.960
I'm not coming anywhere
till I get some assurances.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.940
Assurances of what?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.940
Four things.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.000
I-mmu-ni-ty.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Sir.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
DI Cottan.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.139
Questions about what, sir?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.400
When do you want to do this, sir?

51:00.000 --> 51:02.199
No. No, I'm happy to assist.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.400
All right.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Let's do this.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.340
Morning.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.940
A word to the wise --

52:07.000 --> 52:09.960
Arnott or Cottan, if either
turns out to be a bad apple,

52:10.000 --> 52:10.960
he's acting alone.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.960
They can't be connected
to any wider conspiracy.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.940
Let's see.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.960
And Patrick Fairbank the same.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.940
We feel his legal team have a strong case,

52:21.000 --> 52:22.960
his dementia precludes a trial.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.960
He might have forgotten some
important details. Exactly.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.940
Or worse still...

52:29.000 --> 52:30.960
he might remember them.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.940
What are you saying?

52:33.000 --> 52:35.960
You see, I finally understand why
you were appointed by the PCC.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.960
I'm the loose cannon here.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.960
If I see a bent copper I'll go after him

52:40.000 --> 52:42.940
irrespective of rank
or political expediency.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.940
I'm not going to apologise
for having one eye on PR.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.960
Anti-corruption is a double-edged sword.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.960
We need to find just enough bent
coppers to avoid accusations of

52:52.000 --> 52:54.960
a cover-up but no so many that
the public starts to wonder

52:55.000 --> 52:56.960
if the police can be trusted.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.960
So we let Patrick Fairbank
just slip through the net?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.960
Because of all the peers
and the politicians

53:02.000 --> 53:03.960
and the police officers
he might implicate?

53:04.000 --> 53:07.940
Meanwhile, we go back to chasing
disc jockeys and game show hosts?

53:08.000 --> 53:09.960
I'm just doing my job. And I'm doing mine.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.960
And it's called nicking
bent coppers and I don't care

53:13.000 --> 53:15.960
whether it's one rotten apple
or the whole bloody barrel.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.960
There's a line and it's
called right and wrong.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.960
And I know which side...

53:21.000 --> 53:22.940
my duty lies.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.960
So why don't you write a nice
letter of resignation to the PCC

53:26.000 --> 53:27.940
or I swear to God...

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
I will drag you down
with the rest of them.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.960
In last night's interview
of DS Arnott you produced

54:01.000 --> 54:04.940
a piece of evidence --
item reference MRC-2 --

54:05.000 --> 54:08.940
namely the golf tee and the envelope
found at Danny Waldron's flat.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.960
Wonder if you can explain
in a little bit more detail

54:12.000 --> 54:14.940
how you came by this piece of evidence?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.960
I'm not sure I understand
what you're driving at, sir.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.960
Well, there were half a
dozen of you on that search,

54:20.000 --> 54:21.960
how come no-one else saw it?

54:22.000 --> 54:23.960
Did you swear them all to secrecy or what?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.940
Oh, I see, sir.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.940
No, what happened was -- we
detected an illegal firearm.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.960
I sent an officer to bring someone
with firearms training urgently,

54:33.000 --> 54:34.960
so as to secure the firearm.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.940
I had the legitimate concern it
wasn't safe or it was booby-trapped

54:39.000 --> 54:43.940
and it was then I saw the
golf tee in the envelope. So...

54:44.000 --> 54:46.940
with no-one else watching you...

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
you seized this piece
of evidence? Yes, sir.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.960
Did you order forensics on the golf tee?

54:55.000 --> 54:56.960
I did but there were
no noticeable findings.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.940
Did you order forensics on the
inside of the envelope? Yes, sir.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.940
When? Well, this was something
we omitted in the first instance

55:05.000 --> 55:07.940
but rectified as the inquiry progressed.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.960
Did you put pressure on a
junior rank not to disclose

55:11.000 --> 55:13.139
the forensics to DS Arnott?

55:14.000 --> 55:15.940
Yes. Why?

55:16.000 --> 55:17.960
Steve Arnott was concocting accusations

55:18.000 --> 55:19.960
I wasn't doing my job properly.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.960
I didn't want to give him
any ammunition. So...

55:23.000 --> 55:25.960
you actually missed a
crucial piece of evidence.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Well...

55:29.000 --> 55:32.940
Forensics detected ink and blood
on the inside of that envelope.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.940
That suggests there was
a bloodstained note

55:36.000 --> 55:37.960
inside the envelope. There wasn't though.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.940
No ink or blood on the golf tee. So, what?

55:42.000 --> 55:44.960
Danny Waldron must have put it in
there after he removed the note?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.940
Look, this note,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.960
some people have been making
a mountain out of a molehill.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.960
If it was such an issue, why
didn't I just pocket the envelope

55:53.000 --> 55:54.960
and no-one would be any the wiser?

55:55.000 --> 55:57.940
Which I didn't do, by the way.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.960
Maybe the envelope had already
been seen by somebody else

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
on the search team, but
the contents hadn't.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.940
I found a golf tee. I remained
in the vicinity of the firearm

56:08.000 --> 56:10.940
until an officer arrived to make it safe.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.960
Now, if that note went walkabout,
it's because Danny Waldron moved it

56:14.000 --> 56:16.960
before we got there. In the
end, missing the forensics

56:17.000 --> 56:18.960
made no difference to
the inquiry whatsoever.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.940
That's one of the things we're
here to determine, DI Cottan

56:23.000 --> 56:24.960
and I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
DC Fleming, moving on.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.940
Item reference EGH-1. EGH-1 is an
intelligence file on Ronan Murphy,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.940
the suspect shot dead by Danny Waldron.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.960
It's where this whole inquiry
started, and it omitted information

56:43.000 --> 56:45.960
that would have allowed us to
connect Ronan Murphy to known

56:46.000 --> 56:47.960
high-ranking criminal Tommy Hunter,

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
and the cover-up of
historic child sexual abuse.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.940
DI Cottan, have you seen
this file before? Yes, sir.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.960
And who provided you
with access to this file?

56:59.000 --> 57:00.940
You did, sir.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.940
You see, my particular
concern here, DI Cottan...

57:06.000 --> 57:11.000
is if you were familiar with this
file before I gave you access?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.400
Do you have an answer, DI Cottan?

57:19.000 --> 57:20.960
Yes, I was familiar with the file.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.940
Yes.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.960
And how were you familiar with it?

57:25.000 --> 57:27.960
I acquired the file from a
former Major Violent Crime officer

57:28.000 --> 57:30.960
involved in the investigation
into the murder of Tommy Hunter --

57:31.000 --> 57:32.940
DS Rogerson.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.960
I then passed it over to Gill
Bigelow. Yeah, not to me.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.940
Not to DS Arnott, not to DC Fleming.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.960
Well, I wanted to avoid Steven
Arnott. I think we all know why.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.960
That file had crucial pieces
of information removed that held

57:45.000 --> 57:47.960
this inquiry back for weeks. Yeah,
well, I'm sorry about that, sir,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.960
but I took that file at
face value, in good faith.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.960
And when we found out about
the missing information

57:53.000 --> 57:53.960
why didn't you say something?

57:54.000 --> 57:57.940
You should have been shouting that
from the rafters, man! No, sir. No.

57:57.980 --> 57:58.960
I didn't have the evidence yet

57:59.000 --> 58:01.940
and I didn't want to
alert them beforehand.

58:01.980 --> 58:02.960
Alert who?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.940
Don't you see, sir?

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
DS Rogerson is a former
girlfriend of DS Arnott.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.940
I'm sorry, sir. Weren't you aware
of the relationship between Rogerson

58:17.000 --> 58:18.940
and Arnott?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.940
No. I wasn't.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.960
You should have told him, DC Fleming.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.940
Spare the gaffer his blushes.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.960
Well, the only person known
to have handled that file

58:29.000 --> 58:32.940
apart from DS Rogerson
is you, not DS Arnott.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.960
Well, the pair of them must have
hatched a plot to alter the file.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.960
DS Rogerson denies altering the file.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.960
Well, she would, wouldn't
she? Look, sounds to me

58:41.000 --> 58:42.960
like this is another one
to throw at Steven Arnott.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.960
I'm still exorcised by the
fact you didn't mention

58:45.000 --> 58:48.940
any of this sooner. I don't cast
aspersions on fellow officers.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.960
Unless I can back it
up with hard evidence.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.139
Unlike some I can mention.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
DC Fleming.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.960
On screen, you'll see evidence
gathered in the case against

59:06.000 --> 59:07.940
Harinderpal Bains.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.940
Images 291 and 292 showing
item reference MR-3 and MR-4.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.940
MR-3 and MR-4 are
unregistered mobile phones

59:16.000 --> 59:18.940
recovered from Hari Bains' home.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.940
So, what is this?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.960
One of our own's about to be
charged with murder, I think

59:24.000 --> 59:25.960
we're entitled to ask a
few questions, don't you?

59:26.000 --> 59:29.940
Yeah, no, no, of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.960
These phones were provided
to Bains and he used them

59:32.000 --> 59:34.960
to communicate with The
Caddy. A similar type of phone

59:35.000 --> 59:37.960
was recovered from the boot of
DS Arnott's car. Yeah, well,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.960
these are matters of fact in
the case against Steven Arnott.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.960
Yeah, well, I'm just making
sure we all understand the facts

59:43.000 --> 59:44.940
as they stand.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.940
We'll return to the phone shortly.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.940
Now, in last night's interview of DS
Arnott you stated that you'd attempted

59:52.000 --> 59:54.960
to order a second postmortem
on the body of PC Rod Kennedy.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.960
A search of e-mail records
found no e-mail from you

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
to the pathologist office
requesting said postmortem.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.960
DI Cottan?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Uh? Seriously?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.960
You know what the IT system
is like in this building.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.960
Just because it is not on the server,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.960
that does not mean I didn't send it.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
As a matter of fact, DI Cottan,
what I'm seeing here is a pattern.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.960
A pattern of failure to
discharge your responsibilities

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.960
as a senior detective.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.960
You should have been
chasing up that postmortem!

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.960
No, you are absolutely right, sir.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.940
And what's worse is Kate had made a
specific point of asking me and all.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.960
I was beside myself when I realised

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.800
and I apologise unreservedly for my error.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.960
But you see, DI Cottan...

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.960
it raises the distinct possibility
that you were somehow reluctant

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.940
to seek confirmation that
Kennedy WASN'T a suicide.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.960
That he was in fact murdered.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.960
I was very pleased with
that information, sir,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.960
as it was instrumental
in our arrest of Bains.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.340
For which I won a commendation.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.940
Let's just stay with
Hari Bains for a second.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.960
He levelled some very disturbing
allegations against you,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.960
DI Cottan, wouldn't you agree?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Which I strenuously deny. And for
which there is zero evidence.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.940
Yeah, well...

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.400
we carried out a search of
your service vehicle. What?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.960
Now, I am doing very well to
avoid blowing my top here.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.940
This is out of order.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.960
And as you well know, completely illegal

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.960
under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.960
as DI Cottan is neither under
arrest nor charged with an offence.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.960
Yes, well, said illegality
would only apply

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.960
if it was DI Cottan's personal vehicle.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.960
His service vehicle is owned by the police

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.960
and as such we are entitled to search it

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.960
without any form of authority.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.960
Still, in my view,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.960
we have reached the point
where either you stop

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.079
or you caution my client.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.199
DI Cottan, stay right there.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.960
You do not have to say anything, however,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.960
it may harm your defence if
you fail to mention something,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.940
under questioning, that you
later go on to rely on in court.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Of course, anything you do say may
be used in evidence. Thank you.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.960
Now, what the hell are you
doing searching my car?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.940
This is a signed authority from
Superintendent Summers of AC-3

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000
to investigate AC-12 officers, based
on concerns raised by DC Fleming.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.940
OK.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Just doing our job here,
there is nothing personal.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.960
OK, it was obviously
investigating Steven Arnott.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.960
Not me.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.960
The signed authority from
Superintendent Summers

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.940
is a bit like Grandma's nightgown.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.940
It covers everything.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.960
DC Fleming, the search of
DI Cottan's service vehicle,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.960
if you please.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.940
Sir.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.940
Service vehicle November Juliet
Zero Seven Zulu Foxtrot Whisky

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.940
was examined forensically,
with one notable finding.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.940
Item GBS-8 is a number
of synthetic fibres.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.940
Comparison of fibres from
GBS-8 and NTW-7 finds multiple

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.940
chemical correlations that
imply a very strong likelihood

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.960
the materials derive from
the same original source.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The same original source.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.960
NTW-7 is the item reference
assigned to the rope

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.940
found at the industrial unit
where Hari Bains was arrested.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.400
The noose had been in your boot.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
The noose that you claimed Hari
Bains was going to hang you with.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.940
What the forensics are suggesting
is that you planted it there

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.960
in that industrial unit

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.199
to falsely incriminate
Bains for Kennedy's murder!

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.960
Bains had handled the rope
when he prepared the noose.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.960
Bains and I had a scuffle in which
he attempted to overpower me.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.960
Fibres transferred onto me.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.960
Those fibres were then transferred
into my service vehicle

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.960
the next morning when I clocked on.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.940
They were in the boot -- nowhere else.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.960
The first thing I do before I get
in the motor is sling my coat

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.960
and briefcase in the boot.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.960
Now, if those fibres were
going to end up anywhere,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.800
that is exactly where they would be found.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.940
Are you covering...

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.940
for the real murderer of Rod Kennedy?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.539
No, I'm not.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Were you involved in murdering
Rod Kennedy? No, I wasn't.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.880
Returning to the mobile
phones... Happy to.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.940
On screen, image 104.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.940
Image 104 shows item reference KMF-13,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.960
an unregistered mobile phone,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
and item reference KMF-14 is a
subscriber identification module.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.280
Do you recognise these items?

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960
No.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.960
No? I'll give you "no".

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.960
These items were submitted
to us in evidence by a witness

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.960
who alleges that they
do or did belong to you.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.960
Well, then, the witness is mistaken.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.940
Analysis of said subscriber
identification module KMF-14

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.940
revealed no activity since October 2014.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.960
All communications up to
and including that date

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.940
appear to relate to
other unregistered users.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.940
Right, so you have got a phone
that doesn't belong to me

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.960
and a load of mysterious calls.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.940
Pardon me if I don't see the significance.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
On screen, image 909.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.940
Image 909 is item reference SJP-32.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.940
It was detected in the boot of a vehicle

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.960
found at the Edge Park Golf Club

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.940
in July of 2012.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.940
The vehicle is registered
to Alex Campbell --

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.940
the alias being used at the
time by one John Thomas Hunter.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.960
Now, it was known Tommy Hunter
used numerous such phones

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.940
to conduct his criminal activities.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.960
But this particular phone
is of interest to us

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.940
because of a call made on the 8th
of July 2012 at around midnight.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.940
It was from Hunter's phone to yours.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.960
And that's the significance, fella.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.940
In black and white.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.960
I have no connection with this phone
or SIM Card you have been given.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.940
And I've certainly no
connection to Hunter.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So how come we are being told
this phone belongs to you?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.940
This witness you've got, I bet he said

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
he found this phone in my service
vehicle a couple of years back.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.960
Well, I can neither confirm nor deny...

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:58.960
Yeah, well, I CAN confirm that

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.940
he's sat on this so-called
evidence for a long time.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.960
I reckon he also told you
he conned me into taking

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.960
the wrong SIM Card back while
he held on to the real McCoy.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.960
Yeah, well, as I said, I can
neither confirm nor deny.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Is there anything you've got
linking me to these items? Mm?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.400
Something like forensic evidence?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.940
I did leave my phone
in my service vehicle.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.960
And I was very grateful when DC Morton --

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.940
and let's not be coy about
names -- returned it to me.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.960
Now, I have no idea where this
other SIM Card has come from.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.960
But DC Morton informed us
that it was you who induced him

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.960
to mislead the original
inquiry about The Caddy,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.940
that it was you, DI Cottan,
who suggested attributing

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.940
the nickname to a deceased police officer.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.960
Well, that's just not true, sir.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.940
It was DC Morton who did the misleading.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.940
He is the one that has been falsely
claiming disability benefits.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.960
He will say anything to cling on
to his pension. Anything at all.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
The man is a completely
unreliable witness.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
DI Cottan, where were you
on the morning of July 17th?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.960
You're asking me where I was
when Lindsay Denton was murdered?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:14.960
100% that's what she's asking you.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.960
You need to demonstrate some
legal basis for that question

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
or I suggest you withdraw it immediately.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.738
Kate, bring up the next item and the map.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.939
Item reference MB-1 to MB-5,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.960
traffic cameras captured
images of this vehicle

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.960
on the morning of Lindsay's murder.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.960
Identical make, model and
colour as Steve Arnott's

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.399
but with different registration.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.939
It was driven on the route matching
Lindsay's location that morning.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.960
The registration proved to be false.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.960
We are curious about the logic here.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.939
The logic?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.960
Steve Arnott takes the
trouble to disguise a vehicle,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.960
but there were no fake plates found
when Lindsay's body was discovered.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.960
I mean, why would Steve
remove the fake plates...

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.960
and then leave Lindsay's body
lying in the front passenger seat

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.140
for all the world to find?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.939
My hypothesis would be Steven Arnott
only meant to abduct Lindsay Denton.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Something went wrong, he
killed her, he panicked.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.960
Would Lindsay really
have got into Steve's car

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.939
if she'd seen it was
displaying fake plates?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Everyone makes mistakes.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Indeed we do, DI Cottan.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.960
Are there any witnesses that saw

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.939
Steve's car being stolen, as he claimed?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Mm? Any witnesses that saw
anyone else driving the vehicle?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I think these are questions
for Steven Arnott, not me.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:49.960
DC Fleming.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.939
Steve Arnott insists
he returned his firearm

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.960
four days before Lindsay's murder.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.960
The booking-out officer
at South Ferry armoury

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.960
corroborates Steve's story.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.960
The booking-out officer
is covering his own arse.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.960
Yeah, well, an impostor could
have obtained the murder weapon

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.960
and then forged the paperwork
to make it appear that

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.960
Steve Arnott's firearm had the same
serial number as the murder weapon

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.960
and that he never returned it.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.939
That's an interesting theory.
But it couldn't have been me.

01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:15.960
I am not an AFO.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.939
How would I have obtained
the murder weapon?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.960
The Caddy commands a
network of corrupt officers.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.340
He does.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.939
But Steve Arnott's The Caddy, not me.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.960
You have thought that since
before Lindsay's murder. Yeah.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.939
Yeah, in fact, you made a call to me
the night before Lindsay's murder.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.960
You called me after you had
observed Lindsay Denton

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.399
return to her approved premises.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.939
Yeah. At 15 minutes after midnight,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.960
you called me from your
mobile and you said,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.960
"That lead on Steve looks
like it's going to pan out,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.939
"he really did plant the
money at Lindsay's. Sorry.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.939
"I thought you would want to know
before it becomes common knowledge."

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.479
Did you make that call, DI Cottan?

01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960
I...

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.960
Yeah. Yeah, so what was that
lead that was going to pan out?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Erm...

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.960
Well, it couldn't have been
the money in Steve's gym bag,

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.960
because that wasn't discovered
until the forensics carried out

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
a search in the service
vehicle the next day.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.960
Arnott was behaving suspiciously
and I wanted to give Kate

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.960
a heads up, as they had been
partners for a long time.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.960
Oh, that's very considerate of you,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
but I will ask you for a second
time -- what was the lead?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.279
Erm...

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.960
.. I had glimpsed some
banknotes in his gym bag,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:40.960
I intended to investigate.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.100
When did you see the
banknotes? Earlier that day.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.960
But how could you have known
that forensics would connect them

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.479
to the money planted at Lindsay's?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.199
Eh...

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.939
DI Cottan, were you able to forewarn Kate

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.960
because you had a scheme in mind
where you were going to plant

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.960
that money in Steve's service vehicle?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.960
No. No, absolutely not.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.800
That's how the service vehicle was stolen.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.939
You cloned the key

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.960
and were plotting to use it to
plant evidence against Steve. No.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.939
No, absolutely not.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.939
DI Cottan, I think we have earned
the right to ask you the question --

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.939
will you kindly tell us your whereabouts

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
between 10 and 11 that morning?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.199
Well, I really don't have
to answer that question.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.939
Don't you?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.960
This is a voluntary interview,
and I am only cooperating out of

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.939
my lawful duty as a police officer
to assist in a criminal inquiry.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.960
Indeed you are, indeed you are,

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.960
and we can call a halt to
the proceedings right there

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.939
and leave this question hanging
over you and your career --

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.960
or you can stick your hand
up and offer us an answer

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.960
and exclude yourself from our inquiries.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.960
Entirely your decision.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.680
Take your time.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.939
I was at my flat.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.939
I had had a late night on surveillance

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.960
and I needed to catch up on some kip.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
So you were in during
those hours? Yep. Yep.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.680
Say that again.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
You just said you were in your
flat, we have that on tape.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.199
Eh...

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.939
It's a very simple matter, DI Cottan.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.960
DI Cottan has answered,
haven't you, DI Cottan?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.960
You have mentioned, when
questioned, something

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.600
you later intend to rely on in court.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Yeah, look, I... Sorry. I
may have got that wrong.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Eh, I just need to... think. Erm...

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.939
I-I'd been up late and...

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.340
Take your time, take your time.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I, eh, I need to think about
that one. Absolutely, absolutely.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Maybe I could just... Yeah...
check my calendar... Yeah, yeah.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
You wouldn't have entered
my flat, would you, Kate?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I mean, alone.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.939
Tend to this wounded man here, quick!

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.939
Kate! You all right?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Someone start CPR. I want
this building locked down!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Open the door!

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.939
Don't move!

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Give me your Glock! There's a
pick-up point, it's all arranged!

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.960
Get back! MOVE!

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.079
Stop! Stop, armed police!

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.539
Keep driving as fast as you can. OK.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
It looks like they're going
to go left, go with them.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Keep up with them.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Keep going, keep going.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Right, drive on.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Two males, one armed...

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.939
Kate? Suspects heading north
off Kingsgate High Street!

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.399
North off Kingsgate High Street!

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.960
Kate, listen to me, retain visual
contact but do not approach.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.939
We have an armed response unit on
the way. Repeat, do not approach.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.199
Sir.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.539
Armed police!

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.279
Drop your weapon! Drop yours!

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.939
Kate, sitrep.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.939
One suspect down. Repeat,
one suspect down.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.960
Second suspect heading
to Moss Heath flyover.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Moss Heath flyover.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.960
OK, so which one of them
is still up and running?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.939
Dot.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.939
What can I do to help, sir? Good girl.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.960
Get on to the SFC. I need to know where

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.340
those armed response units are!

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.279
Strategic Firearms Commander.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.340
Drop your gun, drop your phone!

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.680
Kate... Drop 'em, hands over your head!

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
They're not here for you, then?
Not yet. But they will be.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.960
My advice? Run now while you can.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.960
I'm too knackered to run. Drop the gun!

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.960
You went into my flat that morning,
you saw I wasn't there? Maybe.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Maybe not. When did you know?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
That'd be telling. Well, now I
see why we never slept together.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.399
It wasn't that I didn't want to.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.960
Please, go now, while it's safe.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.960
I get it -- Steve Arnott's
The Caddy so you can retire?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.960
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.939
They picked you, groomed
you, guided your career.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You know everything.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.939
What are you going to do now, just stop?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.600
What do you think they're going to do?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.960
There's only one way you
can put this behind you.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.960
Kate, I know what I'm
doing. Patrick Fairbank.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.939
They're saying he's going to
get off the child abuse charges.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
You know names, dates, places.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
You know all about monsters like him.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Confess.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.960
Give us the names of all
the people that have ruined

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:26.960
all these people's lives!

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000
All these monsters you've protected!

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.939
Do the right thing. Confess!

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Tell us everything.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.960
Agh!

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.279
Go! Go!

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.960
PC Bindra, AC-12, I am still
awaiting the requested information.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.939
Be on, everybody, one of our
own is out there in harm's way!

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.960
I need to know what's going on!

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.960
Our officer is at Moss Heath flyover,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.939
we need a location on
those armed units, sir.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
We need an ambulance!
Armed police, get back!

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.399
Get back!

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.939
Dot, drop the gun.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.539
Put it down.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.140
No!

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.960
Armed police, drop your
weapon, on the ground!

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.939
I'm AC-12. Everyone back! AC-12.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.960
Everyone, get back, now!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.279
'.. urgent paramedic support.'

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.939
Get away from him!

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I'm taking his dying declaration.
Sergeant, you will stand down!

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Come on, Dot, say it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.680
(Come on, Dot.)

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.800
You're free to go.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Kate?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Who else would it be?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Thanks, mate.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.199
Come on, let's get you home.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.960
Congratulations, Kate.
Thank you. Very well done.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Thanks.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.939
Look how far we've come.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.939
It's a family united.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.939
The Russians have made contact.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.960
They are very dangerous people.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
So are we.
