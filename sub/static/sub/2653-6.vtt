WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.979
No begging.

00:03.037 --> 00:06.507
No begging.
Stella, you're breaking my heart here.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.248
What's breaking your heart
is that sausage and bacon.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.085
- Can you just pick one?
- Don't worry.

00:11.145 --> 00:14.126
- I'm gonna burn it off on the golf course.
- Hmm. How, Jay?

00:14.181 --> 00:17.060
By riding the little cart
or by kicking the ball back into play?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.598
Here. I'm gonna take
Joe Fulgencio to the park.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.633
Can you please stop by the grocery store?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.669
Why doesn't the nanny do this?

00:23.724 --> 00:25.260
You gotta be kidding me.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.533
Gloria has fired five nannies.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.098
I don't like another woman in my house.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.336
I want to be the star.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.741
Stars have nannies.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.780
You know that some of this
is Manny's fault.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.612
Manny!

00:41.275 --> 00:43.881
So Marie, what do you feel like doing
for dinner tonight?

00:43.944 --> 00:46.447
You're eating Dino Bites
because you are a little boy.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.187
Mom!

00:48.249 --> 00:50.354
I'm telling you,
there's an embarrassing press conference...

00:50.418 --> 00:51.920
in that kid's future.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.967
- We're getting married in seven months.
- Or eight months.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.524
I worry about it raining in April.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.126
Well, I worry about me sweating in May.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.468
Okay. We can't decide on anything.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.939
There are too many choices.

01:01.996 --> 01:04.203
Fortunately, one of our best friends
is an event planner.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.302
- Pepper!
- Pepper!

01:06.367 --> 01:08.472
♪ Here come the grooms ♪

01:08.536 --> 01:11.881
♪ All dressed in fun tuxes
from my Pepper collection ♪

01:11.939 --> 01:13.646
Wow. Look at all your ideas.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.345
Honey, this is just the index.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.854
Ronaldo!

01:16.911 --> 01:20.859
I brought linens and place settings
and invitations and stemware.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.451
Hello, I'm Ronaldo.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.826
Don't be such a chatterbox
and go and fetch the platter box.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.195
Now let's lose this couch.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.858
Wow, you need that much space, huh?

01:28.923 --> 01:31.028
No, it's hideous.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.868
This can't be news to you.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.168
Oh.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.774
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:38.833 --> 01:40.870
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:40.935 --> 01:42.972
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:43.037 --> 01:44.948
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:45.005 --> 01:46.279
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:48.676 --> 01:50.349
You're ruining my life!

01:50.411 --> 01:51.481
- These eggs were delicious.
- Mm.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.252
What life? Get out of my room!

01:53.314 --> 01:54.759
- I put milk in them.
- Oh.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.055
it's not your room anymore!

01:56.117 --> 01:58.188
- Well, they sure are fluffy.
- Mom!

01:58.252 --> 02:00.698
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning, troops.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.701
Claire, I owe you a pack of lady razors.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.634
I'm just gonna go stand out in the yard.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.037
- Seriously, get out!
- I told you it's not your room!

02:08.095 --> 02:11.372
Tension between Haley and Alex
has been getting pretty high...

02:11.432 --> 02:16.313
so our solution was to move Haley down to
the basement, which we were just about to do-

02:16.370 --> 02:18.316
When my dad came out for a weekend visit.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.715
Two weekends ago.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.549
After my mom passed away,
he dated this woman named Annie...

02:22.610 --> 02:26.183
and she broke up with him, and then
he seemed kind of down, so I invited him out.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.590
Gross! Those are my socks!

02:27.648 --> 02:28.922
They are not! Mom!

02:28.983 --> 02:31.759
I'm just gonna pop outside.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.492
I should get her a rake.

02:36.056 --> 02:41.369
Welcome to King's Landing!
I am the evil boy king, and I want your heads!

02:41.428 --> 02:42.634
- Yeah!
- Oh, gosh! Oh!

02:42.696 --> 02:45.643
Ay. look how much they all love you.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.736
Oh, thanks. I'm just trying
to match the energy...

02:47.801 --> 02:50.304
of their video games
and whosits and whatnots.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.544
I'm gonna play tennis.
I can pick you up at noon.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.643
- Oh, hi. Joan, right?
- Yes.

02:54.708 --> 02:59.088
Hi. I'm Andy. I'm her manny- male nanny.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.921
Hi. I'm Gloria.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.483
This might just sound a little crazy...

03:02.550 --> 03:04.552
but I don't think Joan likes me.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.598
Oh, that's not crazy. She doesn't.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.260
Her husband's always staring at you,
and she's worried you're gonna steal him.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.859
What?

03:10.925 --> 03:14.168
Be happy, little guy.
This world belongs to you.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.572
I would never steal anybody else's man...

03:16.630 --> 03:18.075
especially not her fat husband.

03:18.132 --> 03:21.204
Hey, he's not fat anymore.
I helped him lose 30 pounds.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.479
Thanks, Andy.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.417
Careful. if I bring you home scratched,
I lose my deposit.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.283
- Hmm.
- I'm kind of a chef too.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.754
Here, try this.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.691
Hmm!

03:33.747 --> 03:36.853
It's quinoa. You actually burn calories
while eating it-

03:36.917 --> 03:40.831
So, Andy, tell me, are you
really happy with that Joan?

03:42.223 --> 03:46.433
Every wedding is unique, like a snowflake.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.472
And my job is to give you the snowflake...

03:49.530 --> 03:51.441
that makes everyone die with jealousy.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.307
That's all we've ever wanted.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.938
So let's start with a color palette.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.984
I'm thinking... purple.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.349
Purple! That is a color! Wow!

04:01.408 --> 04:03.217
- Yeah, we don't love purple.
- Not our favorite.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.146
Excuse me?

04:06.213 --> 04:08.250
It's just that purple
might be a little bit bold for-

04:08.315 --> 04:10.056
No, I get it. You think I'm an idiot.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.187
- No. No!
- No, we don't, Pepper.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.925
Well, obviously, you know better than I.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.968
After all, I've only put on hundreds
of magnificent weddings.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.434
Come, Ronaldo.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.438
They're not interested
in planning a wedding.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.029
They're interested in hurting people.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.905
- No, Pepper. Pepper, wait.
- No, Pepper, wait.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.705
Listen, we can consider purple.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.677
This is just a lot for us to take in.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.180
- Oh.
- Yeah.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.374
Oh!

04:30.437 --> 04:32.815
Of course. I get it.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.013
Let the idea wash over you for a bit.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.148
We had also discussed
a more neutral palette.

04:39.213 --> 04:41.352
Ronaldo! They're washing.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.094
I'm sorry. He means well.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.863
Now let's talk about your entrance.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.231
Yes, entrance.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.830
The idea of two men being able to marry...

04:54.895 --> 04:57.102
seemed like a fantasy...

04:57.164 --> 05:02.011
so I see you riding down
the purple aisle on a-

05:04.772 --> 05:06.911
unicorn.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.616
Are you sure, Grandpa?

05:15.683 --> 05:16.923
It might be fun.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.590
Sorry, Luke.
I just don't think I have it in me today.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.601
Did you see that? When has your dad
ever not wanted to pull Luke's finger?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.263
He's hurting, Phil.
I think he needs to see a therapist.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.738
Claire, he doesn't need a therapist.

05:27.795 --> 05:31.242
Why? Honey, that's what they do.
They help people cope with loss.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.642
They'll even come the house
if we need them to.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.442
I should talk to my dad. You know what?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.948
He was pretty down after the divorce.
I bet he has some insight.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.007
Yeah, 'cause your dad's
so in touch with people's feelings?

05:40.074 --> 05:41.519
When a man is overcome with emotion...

05:41.575 --> 05:44.146
at a Celine Dion concert,
you do not tell him grow a pair!

05:44.211 --> 05:46.316
- Phil!
- The ship went down, but their love lasts forever!

05:46.380 --> 05:48.417
Shh! Dad, hi.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.655
Yeah, listen.
Uh, Frank is really depressed.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.561
I think he should see a therapist.
What do you say?

05:52.619 --> 05:53.962
He doesn't need any of that.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.365
Yeah? Uh-huh.
Th-That's exactly what I said.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.902
- Give me that.
- I-I-

05:57.958 --> 06:00.564
- Jay, what did you just say?
- Take him out and meet some women.

06:00.627 --> 06:03.335
A thousand therapists couldn't do
what Gloria did for me.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.468
Oh, I agree. Claire was wrong.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.569
I'll tell you what. I know a fun place.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.080
Tonight, you, me and Frank
out on the town.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.616
Oh, fun! A three-way!

06:11.672 --> 06:13.117
I already regret this.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.380
I'm excited too.
I got to get going though.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.479
- Mm-mmm.
- All right. Bye.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.753
Gloria, we're back!

06:20.814 --> 06:22.623
Here. Let me lighten your load.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.458
- Who are you?
- I'm the new manny.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.293
Am I being replaced?

06:26.353 --> 06:29.630
Jay, Manny, meet Joe's new manny, Andy.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.601
- Can I talk to you a second?
- No, thank you.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.932
We're gonna need to discuss this.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.473
I get it.
I understand. it's a big decision.

06:35.529 --> 06:39.170
But if it eases your mind at all,
know that I'm not just here for baby Joe.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.736
- I'm here for you too.
- Doesn't ease my mind at all.

06:41.802 --> 06:46.615
My mission is to make all of your lives
happier and healthier.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.983
Is this because I ate that party sub?

06:49.042 --> 06:53.582
Oh, crackers!
I left my phone upstairs in the nursery.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.491
Could you grab it for me?

06:56.550 --> 06:59.497
I know people get all squirrelly
when they hear the word "healthy."

06:59.553 --> 07:02.727
Actually, Manny? My phone is in my pocket.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.771
Sorry, bud.
But my goal is to get you healthy without-

07:05.826 --> 07:10.297
Nope. it is just a pack of gum.
My phone is still upstairs.

07:10.364 --> 07:13.174
Without you even realizing
what's happening.

07:13.233 --> 07:17.010
Wow. I'm such a dodo.
I didn't even bring my phone today.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.914
- I know what you're doing.
- We're gonna talk about it.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.182
Okay. Well, you have my number, so-
I can start tomorrow.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.347
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Call me.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.152
- I will!
- Take care!

07:26.213 --> 07:28.625
That's a nonstarter. Keep looking.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.959
- But he's perfect.
- He's a man. it's weird.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.521
He's a weird man.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.658
He's like Phil,
only I have to pay for him.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.862
This is not a dictatorship.
It's a democracy. We vote.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.839
No way. You always bully Manny,
and he caves. He's weak. No offense.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.933
Whoever thinks that we should hire Andy,
raise the hand!

07:45.999 --> 07:48.343
No, sorry, Mom. Not this time.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.348
I can't have that energy in my house.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.543
Fine. Cook your own dinner.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.587
We will. We'll be fine.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.486
- So what are we having?
- You're on your own, kid. I'm going out tonight.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.026
So what do you think?

08:03.617 --> 08:05.324
I like it.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.525
Also, is it a little Willy Wonka?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.327
You're tired. I'll come back tomorrow...

08:11.391 --> 08:13.200
when you're ready to be more constructive.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.432
- Pepper, no.
- Pepper.

08:14.495 --> 08:15.997
Ronaldo, strike this.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.599
Sorry.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.077
I thought I was wearing a cape today.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.308
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh. What are we gonna do?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.816
I think we have to fire Pepper.

08:25.873 --> 08:29.116
That would kill him.
He's on the brink as it is.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.851
- Why?
- Since the Proposition Ocho was overturned...

08:32.913 --> 08:34.654
he's done 50 gay weddings.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.251
The man is exhausted
searching for new ideas.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.318
You said "ocho" and then you said "50."

08:39.385 --> 08:40.797
You see?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.924
Gays are so nitpicky.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.493
In a straight wedding,
you just have to please the bride...

08:45.559 --> 08:47.800
but the gays have such strong opinions.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.001
It takes a toll on a great artist
like Pepper Saltzman.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.442
You know, I've never thought of it that way.
I mean, look at us.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.413
- We can't agree on one thing.
- No, you're right.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.814
I mean, Cam wants
a rustic country theme...

08:58.872 --> 09:01.751
and I'm looking for something a little more
contemporary and sophisticated.

09:01.808 --> 09:04.015
- It's impossible.
- Maybe you can have both.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.956
Casual elegance, classic with a twist.

09:07.014 --> 09:11.588
- Go on.
- I'd start with raw, natural linen table runners...

09:11.652 --> 09:13.427
to bring the two worlds together.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.694
We eschew the classic round tables...

09:15.756 --> 09:20.364
for rectangular farm tables,
but keep the setting clean and modern.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.701
And then-

09:21.762 --> 09:24.538
- Yes?
- No, I mustn't.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.704
This is wrong.
Pepper is my boss and my mentor!

09:27.768 --> 09:29.975
Oh, and he's our friend.
What are we doing?

09:30.037 --> 09:32.517
We-We got caught up.
We gave in to temptation.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.314
- L-l should go.
- Don't!

09:34.374 --> 09:36.615
I must.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.123
Vintage handkerchiefs
for the guests to cry into.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.988
Ronaldo, wait!

09:41.048 --> 09:44.359
French bistro stemless wine glasses.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.795
I've said too much.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.492
- Ronaldo!
- He's gone, Cam.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.900
Yep.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.963
Guys, we can't stand around all night.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.238
At some point,
we have to talk to somebody.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.074
Come on. How about those two?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.511
Let's go over there.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.947
Oh, my God.
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.444
- Hello, ladies.
- Not interested.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.319
Wow. I-I just said hello.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.188
We're just kind of having a girls' night.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.420
Kathy, be nice. I'm Marcy.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.521
I'm Jay. This is Frank and, uh, Phil.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.429
Hey-lo. I mean hey. Or hello.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.058
I don't know.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.069
And for the record,
I just wanted to introduce my friend.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.900
I wasn't trying
to pick you up or anything.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.496
I'm heartbroken.

10:28.562 --> 10:31.406
- We don't mean to disturb you.
- Oh, you're not disturbing us.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.638
- You have sweet eyes.
- Thank you.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.044
- I'm from Florida.
- I love Florida!

10:36.103 --> 10:37.844
Would you like to sit down, Frank?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.850
Well, uh- Yeah, sure.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.317
Oh, my God. it's happening.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.049
- For your information, I'm married to a gorgeous woman.
- Uh-huh.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.523
Dad, Jay and I
are gonna grab a drink from the bar.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.220
- Sure.
- I think I have a picture of her here on this somewhere.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.989
- Let's go, Jay.
- She won beauty pageants.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.758
- Okay.
- I'm a catch.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.026
Let's get out of here.
This place is dead anyway.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.901
Hey, there's Casanova.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.533
I didn't hear you come in last night.

11:04.598 --> 11:07.477
- So, uh, how'd it go with Marcy?
- Oh, it was okay.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.072
But I actually met someone else
while I was waiting for a taxi.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.776
Well, all right.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.046
And she's downstairs right now.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.746
Well, all right.

11:16.810 --> 11:21.281
Truth is, I, um,
have a bit of a situation.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.658
She says I owe her $500.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.594
Please tell me
you broke something of hers.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.723
No. Turns out she's a hooker.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.325
- You picked up a hooker?
- Well, I didn't know she was a hooker.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.631
We're in my kitchen.
We have to stop saying "hooker!"

11:32.693 --> 11:35.264
You got to get her out of here
before Claire gets back from yoga.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.103
She's not gonna leave
until she gets the cash.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.440
Five hundred dollars?
I think you got ripped off.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.877
- Hey, can I have a hit of that coffee?
- Oh, that's fine.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.347
Trust me. He did not get ripped off.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.347
No, that's good. it's yours.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.852
247. I'm gonna have to run
to an A.T.M.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.123
How could you not know?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.096
Uh- The drinks, the flirting.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.326
I couldn't think straight.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.769
Have you ever touched the smooth,
taut skin of a 48-year-old woman?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.272
I hope to one day...

12:08.328 --> 12:10.239
but that's not gonna happen
if Claire gets home and-

12:10.297 --> 12:12.777
- Hi! I'm back.
- Hey!

12:12.833 --> 12:15.245
Frank, did you have fun last night?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.543
- He did not.
- Hey, who's the woman in the kitchen?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.709
Beats me. I think I'll go freshen up.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.275
There's a woman in the kitchen?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.821
There's a woman in the kitchen.
Yeah, she's a therapist.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.515
The therapist that you recommended.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.990
So I decided it was a good idea.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.186
Oh, that means the world
that you listened to me.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.195
- Thank you.
- Oh, you should get a shower upstairs.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.891
- No, I want to say hi.
- No, not sweaty like that. You smell.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.892
- No, uh-
- Hi. Hi, I'm Claire.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.371
I'm Frank's daughter-in-law, and I just
want to thank you so much for coming...

12:41.428 --> 12:42.805
and helping him out this way.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.501
- It was my idea.
- No, it wasn't.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.804
- Okay.
- All right.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.210
No, hey. I've never told anyone this...

12:48.268 --> 12:50.805
but I have always wanted to do
what you do.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.147
- I think I'd be really good at it.
- No, she wouldn't.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.914
What are you talking about? it's basically
what I already do for the whole neighborhood.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.013
- At least this way, I get paid for it.
- Mm.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.354
Uh-huh. I got a standing 10:30
I got to get to.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.188
- Yes, you do.
- Mom, I'm gonna throw up!

13:02.249 --> 13:04.024
Alex's hair smells like cheese!

13:04.084 --> 13:06.564
It is not cheese!
It is cruelty-free organic shampoo...

13:06.620 --> 13:08.622
- with traces of churned goat's milk!
- So cheese!

13:08.688 --> 13:10.361
Ew, I need a bucket!

13:10.423 --> 13:12.733
Ladies, we have a guest.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.363
I am- I'm really sorry about this.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.407
I'm just at my wit's end with these two.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.500
I don't suppose you have
any experience with teenagers?

13:18.565 --> 13:19.908
Oh, no.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.877
You two remind me of me and my sister.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.573
We used to fight all the time.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.674
I used to accuse her
of stealing my boyfriends.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.741
She would accuse me of trying to stab her.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.879
- You know, sister stuff.
- Oh, my God.

13:29.943 --> 13:34.187
Trust me, if I wanted to stab her,
that skank be stabbed.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.722
She's not a therapist, is she?

13:38.718 --> 13:39.719
Just-

13:39.786 --> 13:41.390
I didn't sleep a wink.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.456
I-i cannot stop thinking about Ronaldo.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.061
I know. I dreamt our wedding
made the cover of Modern Gay Grooms...

13:47.127 --> 13:49.300
and that there was
a magazine called Modern Gay Grooms.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.206
Okay, that's- that's Pepper.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.575
Let's just ask him
to let Ronaldo take the lead.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.136
And risk hurting Pepper?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.514
For all we know, Ronaldo hasn't
even given us a second thought.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.814
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.786
What happened here yesterday was real.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.881
Oh, Ronaldo, we felt it too.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.755
- But what about Pepper?
- I left him.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.293
- What?
- It's over.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.226
He doesn't look at me the way you do.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.457
Oh, this is all happening so fast.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.024
For me too.
But my heart was racing when I left here.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.797
You are my muses-es.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.135
Oh, I feel so guilty.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.367
One quick look. No one has to know.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.836
Oh.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.845
Oh, Ronaldo, what have you done?

14:27.901 --> 14:29.881
Mitchell! Cameron!

14:29.936 --> 14:31.643
- Oh, no!
- Quick! Hide!

14:31.705 --> 14:32.945
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'll hide.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.213
- Cam, not you.
- Okay, yeah. Go, go, go, go, go.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.312
Ronaldo left me.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.413
- What?
- No!

14:39.479 --> 14:40.787
- The swine.
- Oh!

14:40.847 --> 14:43.589
Someone put it in his head that
he could do this without me.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.687
But mark my words, I will destroy him...

14:45.752 --> 14:47.629
and whatever wedding
he thinks he's planning.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.189
Okay, well, that's one way to go.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.303
Daddies, there's a man in the bathroom.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.667
What?

14:53.727 --> 14:55.138
- That's a Wiggles song.
- It's a Wiggles song.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.698
♪ Daddy, there's a man
in the bathroom ♪

14:57.764 --> 14:59.072
♪ There's a man in the ♪

14:59.132 --> 15:01.009
- It's okay, honey. it's okay.
- ♪ He's in the shower ♪

15:01.067 --> 15:02.671
Ronaldo was nothing before I found him...

15:02.736 --> 15:05.842
living in squalor in a dump
barely bigger than this.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.783
How could he do this to me?

15:07.841 --> 15:10.117
Because you never listen to anybody.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.680
I have good ideas,
but you're too thick-headed to hear them.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.852
Ronaldo, how did you get here?

15:15.916 --> 15:18.396
It was you two.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.022
You plotted against me.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.624
I bet that's not even
a Wiggles song, is it?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.067
- Is it?
- No.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.368
- Oh.
- Pepper, we can explain.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.499
Oh.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.544
Do you have any idea how hard I work?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.841
Well, maybe that's part of the problem.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.348
I mean, you've been
through the mill, Pepper.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.713
Heard it.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.653
I've done 53 gay weddings, and-

15:46.379 --> 15:48.757
And... none of them are mine.

15:48.815 --> 15:49.816
- Oh.
- Pepper.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.090
And whose fault is that?

15:52.152 --> 15:55.326
I feel like you're implying mine,
but I really don't see it.

15:55.388 --> 16:00.337
How can a man with such flair for setting tables
leave no seat for one who loves him?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.464
- Oh, my God.
- Ronaldo's in love with Pepper.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.167
I know.
That's why I said, "Oh, my God."

16:04.230 --> 16:06.267
Pepper, do you hear
what Ronaldo is saying?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.472
Of course I do. I'm not a fool.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.037
He thinks I can't set a table.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.676
No, no, no.
Ronaldo is in love with you. Go to him.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.344
What?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.349
You're in love with me?

16:18.411 --> 16:19.719
Sí.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.725
It is true. Yes.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.727
God, that would drive me crazy.

16:23.783 --> 16:27.287
Ronaldo, I- I don't know what to say.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.824
I mean, of course when I hired you,
I found you very attractive.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.563
That's why I hire all my people.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.403
But I-

16:36.463 --> 16:40.605
I never thought you... would find me-

16:40.667 --> 16:42.578
¿Perfecto?

16:43.803 --> 16:46.079
Because that's what you are- perfect.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.813
No, I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I can't.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.287
Gloria, I forgot my towel!

16:56.349 --> 16:59.125
Here it is.
Nice and toasty from the dryer.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.693
Gloria!

17:01.755 --> 17:03.792
She ran to the store. Breakfast in five.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.962
Your underpants are pressed
and on your bed.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.730
Gloria!

17:08.795 --> 17:10.172
So if I'm hearing you right...

17:10.230 --> 17:12.436
you're not so much mad
about the prostitute in the kitchen...

17:12.499 --> 17:14.103
as you are about my lying to you.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.771
No, I'm mad about the prostitute
in the kitchen.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.108
- Mm.
- That's my bad.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.172
Yes, it is.
It's your bad, Frank. Very bad.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.480
Look, I'm a progressive woman.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.316
I-i took a pole dancing class.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.413
I sent my daughter to college
with condoms.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.458
Now I think that sends the wrong message.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.551
- Thank you very much.
- No, you don't get to judge!

17:29.616 --> 17:32.062
Frank, I'm-

17:32.118 --> 17:35.463
I know you're upset
about Annie breaking up with you.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.025
Wait, Annie didn't break up with me.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.297
I broke up with her.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.771
- What?
- Why? I thought she was so great!

17:41.828 --> 17:44.240
Well, I got scared.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.710
I didn't know how to...
be with another woman.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.678
I thought your mother and I
would be together forever.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.215
- Ah-
- I'm sorry, Dad.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.774
I never would have
gone through with it last night...

17:53.840 --> 17:57.617
but, uh, Jeannie was so nice
and professional.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.452
Thank you, Frank.

17:59.512 --> 18:03.085
And for what it's worth,
you got nothing to be nervous about.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.062
- You were wonderful.
- Really? You think so?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.291
Yeah.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.993
If you love that woman,
you should go get her back.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.228
She'd be lucky to have you.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.497
Oh.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.334
Seriously. I see a lot of guys your age.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.238
- Most of them can barely-
- Okay. Let's get you in that cab.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.708
I love your kids.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.211
- That Alex is like a little me.
- Oh, my God.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.577
Good morning, boss, junior boss.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.549
Grab a seat and check it out.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.951
Egg white omelet,
high-protein smoothies...

18:30.009 --> 18:31.886
then I thought we could put on
our running shoes-

18:31.945 --> 18:33.947
I need to cut you off right there, chief.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.993
Seems my wife overstepped her bounds.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.029
Now, you seem like a nice guy.

18:38.084 --> 18:41.088
- Thanks.
- But I don't think you're the best fit for this house.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.690
Are- Are you serious?

18:42.755 --> 18:45.395
- I'm afraid so.
- Okay.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.870
- It was the underpants, wasn't it?
- That didn't help.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.305
Man, I came on too strong. Gosh dang it!

18:50.363 --> 18:52.502
My dad warned me about that
when I turned 14.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.375
He said, "Son, you're about to be
the man of the family.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.779
You got to learn to give people time
to see how special you are."

18:57.837 --> 19:00.078
- Why were you the man of the family?
- Uh-

19:00.140 --> 19:01.881
- He sort of died.
- How?

19:01.941 --> 19:03.943
I don't wanna bring you down, little man.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.580
Neither did my dad.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.092
He'd say, "My disease can't be all bad
if it rhymes with 'answer."'

19:10.617 --> 19:13.097
Those are the flaxseed muffins
that I just baked.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.793
I'll just take 'em out
and get out of here.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.890
Andy, wait.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.899
We're never gonna eat 'em.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.202
Well, then. I'm sorry it didn't work out.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.709
- What didn't work out?
- My mission here.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.644
It was really nice
to meet you though, Mrs. P.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.204
You didn't even give him a chance.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.444
- We took a vote, Mom.
- You gotta respect the vote.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.146
No! You make me hire these nannies
that I don't like.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.780
But when I find one
that I like, you fire him?

19:38.845 --> 19:43.453
I am the one that spends most of the time
around here, so I get to pick!

19:43.516 --> 19:48.659
Shh. Sometimes the louder we are,
the less we're heard.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.292
- You're frustrated right now, aren't you?
- Yes.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.304
Because you feel
like they're not hearing you.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.465
Yes.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.065
Well, that's exactly how they feel.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.505
I'm sorry that I ignored your feelings.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.846
I promise that I will try
not to yell so much.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.386
You're hired.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.422
- What?
- You'd better drink that smoothie.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.253
- We're going on a run!
- This isn't over.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.428
Life isn't easy.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.963
Sometimes we just need a little help-

20:20.019 --> 20:22.295
Getting your confidence back.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.768
Getting on the same page.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.395
Getting out of your own way.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.505
Or just getting moving.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.479
And I'm pleased as punch to be the one-

20:37.537 --> 20:40.040
Okay, this is tough enough
without all the yammering!

20:40.106 --> 20:41.779
Sorry.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.979
Whoo!

20:46.145 --> 20:47.419
What would you like to dance to?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.754
I have to tell you...

20:48.815 --> 20:50.488
we have to have
some sort of square dancing.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.120
We're not doing country.

20:52.185 --> 20:55.655
No square dancing.
There will be no hoedown tonight.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.202
My family is going
to throw a fit. They're gonna riot.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.465
We're not getting married
for them. We're getting married for us.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.267
I think we have
a decorative cake out front...

21:02.328 --> 21:03.807
then we have sheet cakes in the back.

21:03.863 --> 21:07.072
Oh, I see.
Is that the theme you're going for- tacky?

21:07.133 --> 21:08.339
"Sheet," like a sheet.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.176
Oh, "sheet."
I thought he said "chic cake."

21:10.236 --> 21:13.080
- Pepper!
- All of my cakes are chic.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.016
Oh, they are, yeah!
