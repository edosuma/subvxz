<i>Quizmaster, this is Godfather.

00:10.429 --> 00:11.850

00:50.862 --> 00:53.295
One, two, three,

00:53.936 --> 00:56.326
four little people outside.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.703
Plus the three old ladies.

00:59.988 --> 01:01.538
Look, Gabe. Haji soccer.

01:03.301 --> 01:04.650
Tough little haji.

01:08.363 --> 01:10.713
My grandma used to beat me with a 2x4.

01:11.267 --> 01:12.870
Your grandma mean like that, Gabe?

01:12.990 --> 01:15.244
No, man. My grandma hit me
because she loved me

01:15.364 --> 01:17.614
and she wanted me to turn out good.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.929
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.210
We've had eyes on the village
for over one hour now.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.674
There are seven women and children,

01:28.037 --> 01:28.998
no adult males.

01:29.731 --> 01:32.042
No sign of the men
who fired those mortars.

01:32.204 --> 01:33.154
How copy?

01:34.704 --> 01:36.817
<i>This is Hitman Two. Solid copy.</i>

01:38.363 --> 01:39.171
Ray,

01:40.010 --> 01:43.036
- what the fuck is that smell?
- M.R.E. cookies.

01:43.156 --> 01:46.140
What I did was I saved up
all those creamer packets

01:46.301 --> 01:49.487
and all the sugars and I mixed in
peanut butter until I sort of made...

01:49.607 --> 01:51.918
Don't set your face on fire again.

01:52.308 --> 01:54.858
Word to the motherfuckin' street, yo!

01:55.829 --> 01:58.105
I was not the one
who set my face on fire.

01:58.225 --> 02:00.856
I was the fuckin' victim
and you know it.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.056
Sergeant Colbert,

02:06.041 --> 02:07.287
I was thinking...

02:07.448 --> 02:09.913
Those trees over there behind us,

02:10.675 --> 02:12.751
maybe the guys who fired at us
were in them.

02:14.266 --> 02:17.316
Much as I appreciate
Rolling Stone's tactical input,

02:17.598 --> 02:19.654
but I'm confident in the birds.

02:21.586 --> 02:22.336
Birds?

02:22.456 --> 02:25.306
Anything moves in those trees,
birds don't sing.

02:32.472 --> 02:34.155
- Sgt. Espera?
- Yeah?

02:34.578 --> 02:36.961
Do you have any more
of that enactionshit?

02:37.081 --> 02:39.735
- Tenactin.
- Yeah, 'cause this thing...

02:42.300 --> 02:43.555
Jesus Christ!

02:46.234 --> 02:47.701
Did we call it, Sergeant?

02:50.949 --> 02:53.291
- Someone called it.
- Fucking Godfather called it,

02:54.023 --> 02:56.001
- 1,000-pounder from a navy F-18.
- God damn it.

02:56.162 --> 02:59.275
- We don't have the full picture.
- It was on fucking battalion tac.

02:59.518 --> 03:02.466
We had mortars fire at us from
somewhere near that hamlet. Maybe...

03:03.144 --> 03:04.176
Maybe inside.

03:04.841 --> 03:08.744
The bad guys shoot and scoot.
By the time we hit bac they're gone.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.216
I am not the one who asked the enemy
to mix in with the civilian populace

03:15.336 --> 03:17.025
and use them as cover to attack us.

03:17.145 --> 03:19.632
<i>- This is Hitman Two. R.T.B. Over.
- Roger.</i>

03:20.272 --> 03:21.622
We're moving out.

03:24.149 --> 03:26.899
Man, we keep making
the same fucking mistakes.

03:30.525 --> 03:32.675
My fucking cookies got schwacked.

03:36.396 --> 03:38.168
What the fuck is his problem?

03:41.709 --> 03:42.859
Come on, Ray.

03:43.553 --> 03:44.747
We're Oscar Mike.

03:45.128 --> 03:47.987
Someone around here
is hiding a mortar team!

03:50.329 --> 03:53.290
I warn you again,
we will destroy your village

03:53.621 --> 03:55.450
not only if you yourself are hostile,

03:55.570 --> 03:57.896
but if you are harboring
any enemy elements!

04:05.997 --> 04:07.602
Is he threatening me?

04:09.681 --> 04:12.002
He's grateful to be liberated
and pleased to cooperate.

04:12.122 --> 04:14.204
These people are worse
than the goddamn V.C.!

04:17.421 --> 04:19.038
Dave, we've got Meesh.

04:20.934 --> 04:23.547
Not that we're doing any better
than the French in Indochina.

04:23.709 --> 04:26.659
I mean, we're making
every french mistake, right?

04:29.951 --> 04:32.009
This dude has some cool shit.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.876
Give me the map board.

04:33.996 --> 04:36.546
Moreno,
how much longer we gonna be here?

04:43.630 --> 04:45.653
He said the men came from outside,

04:46.105 --> 04:49.060
- not from his village.
- How many men?

04:49.180 --> 04:51.116
He used a word
that means a lot of dudes.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.536
And he says they're planning
to ambush us once we cross the bridge.

04:55.559 --> 04:58.705
Said there are men on the east side,
north side, and the west side.

05:05.095 --> 05:08.216
And the men on the east side,
they got the big guns.

05:13.311 --> 05:15.561
<i>All Hitman Victors, this is Hitman.</i>

05:16.061 --> 05:18.550
<i>- Hitman Three is debriefing locals.
- Hey, Person.</i>

05:19.250 --> 05:22.314
Didn't your mom put your picture up
on the Wal-Mart wall of heroes?

05:23.123 --> 05:23.923
Yep.

05:24.749 --> 05:27.299
My grandma did
when I went to Afghanistan.

05:27.686 --> 05:31.357
I'm on the Nevada,
Missouri Wal-Mart wall of heroes.

05:31.935 --> 05:33.367
Even got my dress blues on.

05:33.684 --> 05:37.191
If my mother ever distributed my
likeness without written authorization,

05:37.311 --> 05:38.761
I would disown her.

05:39.936 --> 05:42.021
Technically speaking, Brad,

05:42.416 --> 05:44.626
but didn't your biological parents
disown you

05:44.746 --> 05:47.283
when they put you up for adoption?

05:49.133 --> 05:50.233
Point, Ray.

05:52.182 --> 05:56.098
I was one of those unfortunates adopted
by upper-middle-class professionals

05:56.431 --> 05:58.568
and nurtured in an environment
of learning,

05:58.688 --> 06:01.046
art, and a socio-religious culture

06:01.166 --> 06:04.711
steeped in over two thousand years
of talmudic tradition.

06:06.493 --> 06:08.561
Not everyone is lucky enough
to have been raised

06:08.681 --> 06:12.312
in a Whiskey Tango trailer park
by a bowlegged female

06:12.432 --> 06:15.938
whose sole qualification
for motherhood is a womb

06:16.058 --> 06:19.408
that happened to catch a sperm
of a passing truck driver.

06:23.746 --> 06:25.711
At least my mom took me to Nascar.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.870
Your dad's a truck driver?

06:37.447 --> 06:38.223
You okay?

06:40.058 --> 06:41.708
It's all good, brother.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.147
Hello.

06:50.373 --> 06:51.623
<i>Asalaam alaikum.</i>

07:00.919 --> 07:02.330
That doesn't get you, poke?

07:29.214 --> 07:31.652
Come on, it'll be good for you.

07:39.048 --> 07:40.077
<i>Asalaam alaikum.</i>

07:43.657 --> 07:44.457
Here.

07:46.745 --> 07:47.795
Here you go.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.020
See?

08:00.651 --> 08:02.044
Don't you feel better?

08:03.235 --> 08:04.244
Fuck it, dawg.

08:04.702 --> 08:08.313
You think giving them some rice
and a chocolate bar is gonna fix things?

08:18.303 --> 08:19.719
Change of plan.

08:20.405 --> 08:24.121
We have a village here providing info
on a possible ambush on the road ahead.

08:25.776 --> 08:27.372
Well, let me guess, sir.

08:27.655 --> 08:29.835
The plan is for us
to drive into it and draw fire.

08:31.908 --> 08:34.347
You'll be happy to know
there is no plan for this.

08:34.467 --> 08:36.038
Godfather's pulling us back.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.760
The R.C.T. is pushing up
some L.A.Vs to clear out the ambush.

08:39.734 --> 08:42.244
We're staying in a wadi south
of the bridge.

08:54.657 --> 08:56.107
Get some!

09:01.013 --> 09:03.076
This is how this ought to be fought.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.728
We feel our way up these back roads,
generate intelligence,

09:07.848 --> 09:10.665
and they send some real ass in
to deal with it.

09:10.785 --> 09:12.913
You really believe pulling us back
from one ambush

09:13.033 --> 09:14.838
represents a change in strategy?

09:16.451 --> 09:18.550
There's no reason
battalion can't accidentally make

09:18.724 --> 09:20.291
a smart decision now and then.

09:20.411 --> 09:23.195
Even a broke-ass clock
is right twice a day.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.355
What's this I'm hearing
about Casey Kasem

09:25.475 --> 09:28.751
going around in front of E-3s and 2s,
calling Lieutenant Fick a coward?

09:31.506 --> 09:32.331
Yeah.

09:33.348 --> 09:35.034
Jesus fucking Christ.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.225
At least we ain't in the position of
having to babysit our platoon Commander.

09:42.821 --> 09:44.798
I heard back in the rear once
they had a plan

09:44.918 --> 09:47.621
to push Navy psychiatrists
forward to combat units.

09:49.028 --> 09:52.152
Yeah, I scoffed then, but if ever
there was a candidate to be locked up

09:52.272 --> 09:54.794
in the rubber tent, we know who he is.

09:56.415 --> 09:59.669
Can you imagine what the doctors
would make of Ray Person?

09:59.789 --> 10:03.539
Need I remind you that he is
the best damn R.T.O. in the business?

10:04.559 --> 10:06.668
As long as you keep him away
from your uglier daughters

10:06.788 --> 10:08.678
and your smaller livestock.

10:10.298 --> 10:11.028
No.

10:12.288 --> 10:14.981
The individual who needs
his head examined is the man responsible

10:15.101 --> 10:17.984
for taking arguably
the finest damn independent

10:18.145 --> 10:21.112
recon operators
of any military in the world,

10:21.469 --> 10:23.841
and dropping us in Humvee platoons

10:24.538 --> 10:28.794
to lead a parade of pogs, officers,
and heavily-armed subhuman morons

10:28.914 --> 10:31.164
like Casey Kasem across Mesopotamia.

10:36.854 --> 10:39.104
How much does Uncle Sam spend on us?

10:39.866 --> 10:42.976
Jump school, dive school, mountain
warfare, ranger school, S.E.R.E.

10:43.096 --> 10:46.454
That's a $1,000,000 on average
to train up 0321s like us.

10:50.055 --> 10:51.330
And here we are,

10:52.247 --> 10:55.273
perfectly-tuned Ferraris
in a demolition derby.

10:57.746 --> 10:59.496
It sure isn't Afghanistan.

11:04.557 --> 11:06.616
Any of us had been running
our teams in that AO,

11:06.964 --> 11:09.125
we sure wouldn't have dropped
a bomb on that village

11:09.245 --> 11:11.095
like they did this morning.

11:11.324 --> 11:12.302
Gentlemen,

11:14.189 --> 11:15.499
to Afghanistan.

11:28.131 --> 11:30.740
In Somalia we were still able
to target these legit motherfuckers...

11:30.860 --> 11:32.351
Hold what you got, warriors.

11:33.079 --> 11:35.897
- November Juliet's coming around.
- Better watch your face, Ray.

11:36.017 --> 11:37.648
Rudy's got the espresso pot brewing.

11:37.768 --> 11:41.650
Yeah, it's obvious I was wrong
about invading Iraq for NAMBLA.

11:41.770 --> 11:44.588
It turns out we're actually here
to set up a forward Starbucks.

11:44.708 --> 11:47.588
Christ, look, we've already inserted
our Fruity Barista.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.158
Thank you very much.

11:49.893 --> 11:53.892
Now all we need
is some shitty fucking music playing,

11:54.012 --> 11:55.291
like Norah Jones,

11:56.028 --> 11:59.606
a couple of high-school girls
getting super fat on iced lattes,

11:59.927 --> 12:02.527
a homeless guy
trying to scam the key to the restroom,

12:02.647 --> 12:05.397
and some faggot
writing his novel on a laptop.

12:05.581 --> 12:07.731
Gunny, this must steam Godfather,

12:08.089 --> 12:10.263
letting other guys go into an ambush
instead of us.

12:10.829 --> 12:13.725
I've never understood what the whole
rush was about in the first place.

12:13.886 --> 12:16.729
There is no doubt
America is gonna beat Saddam's military.

12:16.889 --> 12:18.958
- So why rush this shit?
- Ray,

12:19.428 --> 12:22.337
remember that guy that got
his dick cut off and sewed back on?

12:22.778 --> 12:24.446
Yeah. John Wayne Bobbit.

12:25.357 --> 12:28.407
- He's a former Marine.
- What other famous Marines were there?

12:28.567 --> 12:30.002
Lee Harvey Oswald,

12:30.568 --> 12:34.365
that old children's television show host
Captain Kangaroo, he was one;

12:34.856 --> 12:36.649
and uh, the guy

12:36.940 --> 12:40.609
who climbed the university of Texas
clock tower and shot 16 people.

12:40.729 --> 12:42.712
- No presidents?
- Closest we got was Oswald.

12:42.916 --> 12:45.361
- I met John Wayne Bobbit.
- Get the fuck out of here.

12:45.481 --> 12:47.884
I interviewed him
when he was trying to be a porn star.

12:48.424 --> 12:51.137
- He did this movie where
- Nice!

12:51.502 --> 12:52.807
He fucked a midget.

12:53.730 --> 12:55.790
A Marine will fuck anything.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.011
She was a nice girl, seriously.

13:00.546 --> 13:01.996
Here you go, Gunny.

13:02.288 --> 13:03.561
Thank you, Rudy.

13:03.681 --> 13:05.611
Looks like we're in
for a cold night by the way

13:05.771 --> 13:08.989
- that Zoolander's nipples are twisted.
- Thanks, Rude.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.700
Let me hook you up,
my backwoods brother.

13:13.169 --> 13:13.969
Pappy.

13:16.510 --> 13:18.421
I always gotta fix you up, Pap.

13:18.541 --> 13:21.459
Looks like you've got
some chafing here from your sapi plate.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.362
I've got some emollients in the Humvee.

13:24.482 --> 13:26.132
I'll get the Neutrogena.

13:27.544 --> 13:28.883
Am I pushing you, my man?

13:29.982 --> 13:31.432
Am I going too far?

13:32.107 --> 13:33.638
Pappy, you know I love you, brother.

13:33.673 --> 13:34.499
Rudy, you motherfucker,

13:34.619 --> 13:36.933
hook me up with some
of that sweet November Juliet.

13:37.095 --> 13:39.336
- Roger that.
- Why November Juliet?

13:39.456 --> 13:41.771
It's like, military phonetic alphabet.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.104
You know, like

13:45.018 --> 13:47.461
- Whiskey Tango for white trash.
- Yeah, I get that.

13:47.581 --> 13:49.904
But what does November Juliet stand for?

13:58.995 --> 14:00.157
Nigger juice.

14:01.097 --> 14:02.142
Beautiful.

14:17.817 --> 14:19.543
Jesus Christ, dude.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.260
Gentlemen, as you can see...

14:32.148 --> 14:33.898
I'm told by the C.G. that

14:34.018 --> 14:36.076
the reason for our chow shortage is that

14:36.503 --> 14:39.747
95% of the one MarDiv supply train
in central Iraq

14:40.269 --> 14:43.416
is being allocated
to haul artillery rounds to the front.

14:43.706 --> 14:46.002
For us tonight,
gentlemen, this is good news.

14:47.149 --> 14:48.899
We are on a new map sheet,

14:49.085 --> 14:51.535
the last for phase three of our mission.

14:52.148 --> 14:53.998
I can reveal to you tonight

14:54.252 --> 14:57.680
that the C.G.'s objective since
pushing through Nasiriyah has been this:

14:58.432 --> 14:59.183
Al Kut.

14:59.343 --> 15:01.652
Here, to the east of Baghdad,

15:01.772 --> 15:05.022
Al Kut holds the only major bridge
crossing the Tigris.

15:05.584 --> 15:07.734
Since the inception of phase one,

15:07.961 --> 15:11.694
CENTCOM has felt the need to control
this eastern route to Baghdad.

15:12.227 --> 15:13.294
Phase four,

15:13.787 --> 15:15.491
the assault on Baghdad,

15:15.771 --> 15:19.223
cannot begin until Marines own Al Kut
and its bridge.

15:20.526 --> 15:21.576
Three words:

15:22.211 --> 15:24.500
tempo, tempo, tempo.

15:26.584 --> 15:28.153
The swiftness of our advance

15:28.273 --> 15:31.472
has succeeded in outpacing
the Iraqi military's efforts

15:31.592 --> 15:33.867
to organize large-scale resistance.

15:34.090 --> 15:34.994
Tonight,

15:35.252 --> 15:37.718
Ferrando expects our tempo to increase.

15:39.712 --> 15:40.962
This afternoon,

15:41.212 --> 15:42.362
Bravo company

15:42.822 --> 15:44.894
exploited the willingness of locals

15:45.056 --> 15:48.106
to provide intelligence
regarding an enemy ambush.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.607
That was good work.

15:50.612 --> 15:54.305
No doubt many of you were
disappointed when division sent in

15:55.385 --> 15:58.278
the R.C.T.'s light armored units
to clean them out.

15:58.398 --> 16:01.244
By all rights,
that should have been our tasker.

16:01.406 --> 16:04.556
But it turns out
the C.G. hasn't forgotten about us.

16:05.403 --> 16:06.653
We have reports

16:07.047 --> 16:08.712
that increasing numbers

16:08.832 --> 16:12.507
of paramilitary forces are moving
into this area south of Al Kut.

16:13.274 --> 16:14.528
Tomorrow morning,

16:14.648 --> 16:17.511
the R.C.T. will begin its final push
to Al Kut

16:17.671 --> 16:19.633
on the east bank of the canal.

16:20.678 --> 16:22.357
Our push begins tonight.

16:23.552 --> 16:24.988
We are to advance

16:25.168 --> 16:27.255
along the western side of the canal

16:27.375 --> 16:30.365
starting at approximately
2300 hours local time.

16:32.276 --> 16:34.862
There's a town here, Muwaffaqiyah.

16:35.296 --> 16:38.031
It's about four kliks north
of our current position.

16:38.151 --> 16:40.157
Soon as we pass Muwaffaqiyah,

16:40.990 --> 16:42.702
we've got 30 kliks of highway to Al Kut.

16:45.939 --> 16:48.541
This, gentlemen,
is our happy hunting ground.

16:50.671 --> 16:52.558
The C.G. has given us free rein

16:52.678 --> 16:54.882
to initiate contact all along

16:55.042 --> 16:56.103
this M.S.R.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.402
There's not a Marine on the planet

17:01.777 --> 17:05.127
who wouldn't want to be
in your shoes tonight, gentlemen.

17:13.952 --> 17:14.878
Nate.

17:16.652 --> 17:18.179
Quick word, please?

17:26.746 --> 17:29.196
Looks like we're the quarterback again.

17:30.634 --> 17:31.445
Look,

17:31.912 --> 17:32.677
Nate,

17:33.498 --> 17:35.448
as far as executing this play,

17:36.561 --> 17:38.411
are we gonna have any...

17:42.216 --> 17:43.554
Personal issues, skipper?

17:47.157 --> 17:48.351
Not on my part, sir.

17:52.942 --> 17:55.194
I do however have an issue
with unprofessional conduct

17:55.314 --> 17:57.883
of senior enlisted personnel
in this company.

17:58.003 --> 18:00.153
- Nate, I...
- Gunnery Sergeant,

18:01.379 --> 18:02.933
you do not come up
on a discussion

18:03.053 --> 18:06.916
between the Captain and myself
and speak unless you are spoken to.

18:07.365 --> 18:09.412
And nobody fucking spoke to you.

18:12.268 --> 18:13.733
Aye aye, Lieutenant.

18:19.044 --> 18:21.226
I want to be certain
that senior enlisted personnel

18:21.346 --> 18:22.593
are not speaking for you

18:22.755 --> 18:25.596
when airing derogatory opinions
about the command of my platoon.

18:25.955 --> 18:27.631
If such opinions are yours,
I would ask

18:27.751 --> 18:30.789
that you share them
directly with me in private.

18:32.625 --> 18:33.584
Opinions?

18:40.627 --> 18:43.740
Anyone who says I have opinions
like you said, nate,

18:44.098 --> 18:45.576
he's not on my team.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.125
Very good, sir.

18:56.109 --> 18:57.593
Without the right lubricant,

18:57.713 --> 19:00.965
it's the same thing again and again.
Sucker just jams.

19:01.085 --> 19:02.433
We just have to accept that

19:02.553 --> 19:05.345
the only dependable weapon
you have up there is your saw.

19:07.947 --> 19:08.905
You guys,

19:09.703 --> 19:11.601
I just did a really dirty thing.

19:12.119 --> 19:14.136
You know that picture
of Rolling Stone's girlfriend?

19:14.256 --> 19:17.055
I think it's safe to say we all know
her intimately at this point.

19:17.175 --> 19:20.712
I got it back from Bravo Three and
I swear I was gonna give it back to him.

19:20.832 --> 19:23.117
But I ran into Wasik
on the way over here.

19:23.237 --> 19:25.406
I traded that bitch
for some pec-2 batteries!

19:26.508 --> 19:28.188
Ray, you pimped her out.

19:29.051 --> 19:31.329
She is a dirty little hoochie,
isn't she?

19:34.305 --> 19:35.645
Got any for the thermals?

19:35.765 --> 19:38.555
Jesus, dude. It's a picture
of a reporter's girlfriend,

19:38.675 --> 19:41.339
not of J. Lo's cum-dripping twat.

19:41.678 --> 19:43.147
Yeah, you're right.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.475
Walt, get some sleep.

19:48.717 --> 19:52.187
I'm gonna give this another try, Brad.
You get some sleep.

19:53.832 --> 19:55.007
Thanks, Walt.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.584
What's the challenge and pass?

20:19.076 --> 20:21.326
Blue diamond, blue diamond, asshole!

20:27.087 --> 20:28.720
Q- Tip, what the fuck?

20:29.074 --> 20:31.224
I had to get medieval on his ass.

20:32.137 --> 20:33.137
What is it?

20:33.388 --> 20:37.338
I don't know, but it's got fur
and four legs and a little bit a meat.

21:00.229 --> 21:04.092
<i>All Victors, have team leaders
rally up on Hitman Two Victor. Over.</i>

21:05.200 --> 21:06.450
Yeah, copy that.

21:08.958 --> 21:09.944
Brad.

21:13.767 --> 21:15.146
Brad, get up.

21:17.459 --> 21:18.513
56 minutes.

21:19.146 --> 21:21.252
I've been asleep for 56 minutes.

21:21.703 --> 21:23.153
Team leader meeting.

21:28.376 --> 21:30.396
56 minutes and just one dream.

21:31.576 --> 21:33.426
At least you got the dream.

21:33.671 --> 21:36.415
- I dreamt I was in Iraq.
- Were you naked?

21:38.327 --> 21:40.777
North of our position is the wild west.

21:40.897 --> 21:43.148
We all know we've killed
a lot of bad guys already.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.067
Sure.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.737
Must be some bad guys
in all those women and children

21:46.857 --> 21:48.911
we've been stacking along the roads.

21:49.031 --> 21:50.202
Those who remain

21:50.701 --> 21:53.151
are going to take their last stand here.

21:58.857 --> 22:00.802
Bad news is we don't sleep tonight.

22:00.922 --> 22:02.005
Good news is

22:02.264 --> 22:03.856
we get to kill bad guys.

22:05.086 --> 22:07.646
In six zero mikes,
Bravo company and Charlie company

22:07.766 --> 22:10.834
are maneuvering onto the western side
of this canal.

22:10.954 --> 22:14.336
Our orders are to set up positions
as we see fit along the M.S.R.

22:14.456 --> 22:17.399
and hunt for paramilitaries
operating in the A-O.

22:17.519 --> 22:20.373
Our goal is to terrorize the Fedayeen,
and this platoon will be on point.

22:20.828 --> 22:22.541
Better us than Captain America.

22:24.394 --> 22:26.709
The point is we are taking
the initiative.

22:26.829 --> 22:29.396
And they're letting us do it at night
when we have the advantage.

22:29.516 --> 22:33.515
Sir, need I remind you a lot of that
advantage resides in our thermals,

22:34.229 --> 22:36.730
and we don't have a single working set
in the entire platoon?

22:36.850 --> 22:40.352
Brad, we've still got our N.V.G.s,
pec-4s and 17-bravos.

22:42.376 --> 22:43.187
Yes, sir.

22:43.444 --> 22:46.295
Sir, the regiment's staying over
on the eastern side of the canal?

22:46.415 --> 22:47.734
- Affirmative.
- And we got

22:47.894 --> 22:50.237
- Alpha and H-and-S staying behind?
- We're going lean.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.739
- We're hunters tonight.
- That's all good, sir.

22:54.087 --> 22:56.088
But how do we get around this bridge
and the town

22:56.208 --> 22:58.276
up to where the L.A.Vs was fighting?

22:58.396 --> 23:00.146
We're not going around it.

23:00.766 --> 23:03.516
Brad, your team will be leading us
across it.

23:11.319 --> 23:14.912
Sir, is my team to do a foot patrol
to get eyes on the bridge

23:15.821 --> 23:18.381
and make sure that the enemy ambush
has in fact been eliminated?

23:18.501 --> 23:19.802
Negative, Brad.

23:20.130 --> 23:21.722
Reconnaissance, sir.

23:21.842 --> 23:24.149
Isn't that what reconnaissance Marines
are supposed to do?

23:24.269 --> 23:27.119
Our timetable does not allow
for a foot patrol.

23:27.369 --> 23:29.401
The chances for a serious threat
are very low.

23:29.521 --> 23:31.276
We hit those ambush points hard
all night.

23:31.396 --> 23:32.197
Sir,

23:32.317 --> 23:35.403
if the L.A.Vs came back
with casualties,

23:35.523 --> 23:36.799
how's Humvee supposed...

23:36.919 --> 23:39.578
Frankly, gentlemen, I'm not hearing
the aggressiveness I'd like.

23:46.524 --> 23:49.134
- Prepare your teams to step off.
- Sir.

23:53.147 --> 23:56.334
The people running this war
can fuck things up all they want.

23:56.454 --> 24:00.027
And as long as we keep getting lucky
and making it through alive,

24:00.147 --> 24:02.058
they'll just keep repeating
the same mistakes.

24:09.147 --> 24:10.011
Nate.

24:15.271 --> 24:16.821
Our orders are clear.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.392
I would not help this platoon

24:18.512 --> 24:21.268
by questioning him
or hesitating in any way.

24:22.224 --> 24:23.966
The C.O. reached out to me.

24:24.086 --> 24:25.936
I have to honor that, right?

24:49.682 --> 24:52.151
Hurry up and grab your gear.
Let's fucking go!

24:52.271 --> 24:54.361
Hey, you, get the fuck up! Go!

24:54.521 --> 24:56.904
Hey, yo, Person,
I changed the batteries in the N.V.Gs.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.996
- What's our tad with our Cobra escorts?
- None.

25:05.157 --> 25:06.747
- We don't have comms.
- Why not?

25:07.145 --> 25:08.779
That would be too easy.

25:08.899 --> 25:11.749
I don't know.
No one's rogering up on the tads.

25:12.483 --> 25:14.479
This is going to be a short mission.

25:14.599 --> 25:17.508
Why don't you stay back here
with headquarters?

25:19.525 --> 25:20.775
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:25.310 --> 25:27.402
Reporter ain't gonna leave, Brad.

25:27.522 --> 25:30.397
He skips town on us now,
might change our luck,

25:30.558 --> 25:32.783
and that could adversely affect
our ability to survive

25:32.903 --> 25:34.483
and complete this mission.

25:36.834 --> 25:38.084
Are you kidding?

25:39.462 --> 25:42.074
You don't want to make our luck adverse
and all, do you, dawg?

25:45.114 --> 25:46.030
No.

25:49.623 --> 25:52.030
Poke, make sure your team
watches our mark-19.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.719
If we're down, I want Garza
to pick up the slack with your 50.

25:54.839 --> 25:55.839
Roger that.

25:57.173 --> 25:59.345
See you on the other side, sucka.

26:02.950 --> 26:04.347
Turn it over, Ray.

26:07.529 --> 26:09.055
Trombley, stow this.

26:12.449 --> 26:13.582
Sorry, dude.

26:15.554 --> 26:17.750
Pass me some of your ripped fuel.

26:19.781 --> 26:21.989
And I fucking mean it
about the country music.

26:22.724 --> 26:24.614
You know Brad, you're right.

26:24.734 --> 26:27.836
Now isn't an appropriate time
for country music.

26:27.956 --> 26:30.772
I was thinking
a little more old-school R&B.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.207
Because look, I'm Stevie Wonder,

26:33.902 --> 26:36.952
blind as a motherfucker
in my piece-of-shit N.V.Gs.

26:40.289 --> 26:42.780
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Two Actual.</i>

26:42.900 --> 26:44.293
<i>We are Oscar Mike.</i>

26:49.234 --> 26:51.727
All right, kids, let's make some money.

27:49.954 --> 27:53.915
<i>All Hitman Two Victors, this is
Hitman Two. Increase dispersion. Break.</i>

27:54.662 --> 27:57.872
<i>Low illum is restricting
our vis on the N.V.Gs. Over.</i>

27:59.210 --> 28:01.171
<i>Hitman Two, Hitman Two Three.</i>

28:01.332 --> 28:02.087
<i>Roger.</i>

28:02.956 --> 28:06.181
<i>HitmanTtwo, this is Hitman
Two One Bravo. Roger that.</i>

28:06.718 --> 28:09.368
<i>Hitman Two,
this is Hitman Two Two. Solid.</i>

28:14.306 --> 28:17.290
We have the bridge four kliks
ahead to the west.

28:17.644 --> 28:20.103
There will be a right turn
toward the bridge abutment.

28:20.223 --> 28:21.358
Yeah, roger that.

28:24.541 --> 28:25.341
Brad,

28:26.790 --> 28:29.540
is that a guardrail
on this side of the road?

28:37.925 --> 28:39.275
It's the shoulder.

28:39.538 --> 28:40.488
It slopes.

28:41.773 --> 28:44.189
I know you've got no depth perception
in those N.V.G.s

28:44.309 --> 28:47.136
but use some common fucking sense
in your situational awareness.

28:47.256 --> 28:49.845
It's the way that the fucking
ambient light is slanting in.

28:50.006 --> 28:53.253
I can't tell if dark areas
are ditches or walls.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.466
Two One Bravo, this is Two One Alpha.

28:58.586 --> 29:01.801
Someone on your victor appears
to have his I.R. designator on.

29:01.921 --> 29:04.027
Two One Alpha. Yeah, it's me, dawg.

29:04.631 --> 29:07.736
<i>I got a foot-mobile, possible tango,
about one o'clock,</i>

29:08.340 --> 29:09.282
<i>200 meters out,</i>

29:09.577 --> 29:10.990
crouched on a berm.

29:11.110 --> 29:11.910
Over.

29:13.028 --> 29:13.978
Copy that.

29:21.281 --> 29:25.174
Two One Bravo, that is a trash bag
caught on some kind of scrub brush.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.991
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.312
It's our I.R. lasers.

29:37.161 --> 29:39.030
You can't see them without N.V.G.s.

29:39.150 --> 29:41.700
I don't even have
a plastic bag to shoot.

29:41.891 --> 29:43.848
Oh, now remember James,

29:44.525 --> 29:47.182
once you fire a bullet,
you can't take it back.

30:01.768 --> 30:02.818
God damn it!

30:08.760 --> 30:11.165
Two Actual, this is Two One.
Interrogative:

30:11.285 --> 30:14.176
do we have any idea
what those Cobras are shooting at?

30:14.296 --> 30:17.746
<i>Negative, Two One. We have no comms
with the Cobras. Over.</i>

30:24.640 --> 30:25.440
Fuck!

30:25.918 --> 30:27.359
Why are we slowing, Ray?

30:27.957 --> 30:29.535
My N.V.G.s keep going off.

30:29.655 --> 30:32.959
It's from the fucking flashes from
the rockets keep washing 'em out.

30:33.079 --> 30:34.199
I can't see shit.

30:35.411 --> 30:37.161
Two Actual, interrogative.

30:37.553 --> 30:41.203
Are we to continue forward into area
being lit by those Cobras?

30:41.408 --> 30:44.142
<i>Two One, maintain
direction and speed. Over.</i>

30:44.878 --> 30:45.928
Roger that.

30:48.209 --> 30:51.001
Cobras are frapping the east side
of the river. Over.

30:51.121 --> 30:52.471
Hold your sectors!

30:53.968 --> 30:55.404
- Oh shit!
- Fuck!

31:00.184 --> 31:01.805
Holsey, sweep that area with your I.R.

31:01.925 --> 31:02.725
Shit!

31:03.264 --> 31:04.714
You all right, Walt?

31:05.090 --> 31:05.940
Nothing.

31:06.891 --> 31:08.341
Shell cases hit me.

31:16.123 --> 31:17.327
Why are we turning, Ray?

31:17.606 --> 31:19.380
There was a ditch
or something in the road.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.850
Hey, something's blocking the bridge.

31:22.860 --> 31:24.210
You see it, Walt?

31:24.456 --> 31:27.321
It's like a connex box
in the middle of the road.

31:27.441 --> 31:29.600
<i>All Hitman Two Victors, be advised,</i>

31:29.720 --> 31:31.508
<i>there is an obstacle
in front of the bridge.</i>

31:31.735 --> 31:33.545
<i>We cannot continue forward.</i>

31:34.214 --> 31:36.864
<i>Hitman Two One,
is there any way around it?</i>

31:37.797 --> 31:39.827
<i>Negative, Hitman Two.
We need to peel.</i>

31:39.947 --> 31:41.518
Ray, I need us to egress immediately.

31:42.616 --> 31:44.083
We're in a kill zone here.

31:44.203 --> 31:47.041
Walt, can you see the ditch
that I just drove past?

31:47.161 --> 31:48.511
It ain't a ditch.

31:48.826 --> 31:51.360
It's like a drainpipe
that's been drug on the road.

31:51.521 --> 31:53.737
You have to make
a three-point turn here.

31:54.436 --> 31:55.386
Turn around.

31:55.506 --> 31:58.408
I got trees on my left,
maybe five meters off the road.

32:01.647 --> 32:02.512
Fuck!

32:07.186 --> 32:08.399
Hey, Brad,

32:09.128 --> 32:12.311
Espera's vehicle is in front of us.
We're fucking boxed in!

32:19.207 --> 32:20.681
I don't got nobody out here.

32:21.079 --> 32:22.229
I got nothing.

32:23.004 --> 32:26.792
<i>Two One Bravo, this is Two One Alpha.
We need you to turn around.</i>

32:27.095 --> 32:27.895
<i>Over.</i>

32:28.443 --> 32:30.645
<i>Two One Alpha, this is Two One Bravo.</i>

32:31.181 --> 32:33.079
<i>Two Two is blocking us. Over.</i>

32:33.932 --> 32:36.877
<i>Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two.
We need you to turn around.</i>

32:36.997 --> 32:39.447
<i>You're boxing the platoon in.
How copy?</i>

32:39.762 --> 32:41.369
<i>Eetman Two, dees is Eetman Two Tree.</i>

32:41.939 --> 32:43.589
<i>We hung up on a pipe...</i>

32:45.333 --> 32:46.790
There are men in the trees.

32:48.097 --> 32:50.247
- Contact right!
- Contact right!

32:51.959 --> 32:53.609
Contact, three o'clock!

32:54.254 --> 32:55.157
Go go!

32:56.252 --> 32:57.802
Dismount, 12 o'clock!

32:58.379 --> 33:00.179
- Suppress him with that saw!
- I got him!

33:00.859 --> 33:04.332
<i>Two One victor, this is Two Two Victor.
We're gonna dismount our vehicles now...</i>

33:04.452 --> 33:06.602
Over on the right!
Over on the right!

33:07.584 --> 33:08.634
<i>Taking fire!</i>

33:09.263 --> 33:10.063
Ammo!

33:12.018 --> 33:13.225
<i>Two Three, Two Two.</i>

33:13.345 --> 33:14.527
Stafford, to our three!

33:21.853 --> 33:22.868
Incoming!

33:27.051 --> 33:28.501
Foot mobiles, left!

33:28.994 --> 33:30.585
Ray, how's our progress egressing?

33:31.454 --> 33:34.310
All Hitman Victors, this is Two One.

33:34.941 --> 33:38.092
Is it at all possible
for any of you to back up?

33:39.687 --> 33:40.877
<i>Ees two tree...</i>

33:40.997 --> 33:42.813
God damn Baptista!

33:42.933 --> 33:44.306
How the fuck would you like it

33:44.426 --> 33:46.904
if I joined the brazilian Marines
and only spoke english?

33:47.024 --> 33:48.074
Shift fire!

33:49.514 --> 33:50.864
He's on the works!

33:51.774 --> 33:53.424
Watch your four o'clock!

34:00.432 --> 34:02.784
- Lilley!
- What the fuck?

34:04.386 --> 34:05.836
Would you please...

34:06.056 --> 34:08.246
back the fuck up?

34:08.813 --> 34:11.761
- Garza, are we clear?
- Not going well!

34:14.664 --> 34:17.435
<i>Two Three, get up here.
I need suppression fire now!</i>

34:17.554 --> 34:19.105
<i>Left side! Left side!</i>

34:27.453 --> 34:28.768
I can't I.D. the target.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.561
Bravo Two's getting
chopped up pretty good.

34:32.697 --> 34:33.947
Like Brad says,

34:35.045 --> 34:36.495
stay frosty, gents.

34:37.067 --> 34:38.456
Holy mother of God.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.570
We got a slaughterhouse up there, men!

34:40.731 --> 34:42.581
All gunners, hold your fire!

34:45.023 --> 34:46.973
Eric, watch for infiltrators.

34:47.521 --> 34:48.620
Be prepared to fire.

34:48.739 --> 34:49.889
On my command!

34:50.690 --> 34:53.947
He gives an order to shoot,
we'll end up schwacking Bravo Two.

34:54.067 --> 34:55.627
Hot mike the radios, dirty.

34:56.489 --> 34:57.539
You got it.

35:02.562 --> 35:03.588
R.P.G.!

35:06.357 --> 35:07.932
Watch your fire!
Watch your fire!

35:09.830 --> 35:10.880
100 meters!

35:11.972 --> 35:13.373
Get that. 50 cal up!

35:15.719 --> 35:16.669
Fuck yeah!

35:19.257 --> 35:20.837
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

35:20.957 --> 35:23.155
We are unable to move
in any direction, over.

35:25.902 --> 35:27.056
This is Two Two.

35:27.176 --> 35:28.202
Man down!

35:28.322 --> 35:29.200
Say again,

35:29.320 --> 35:31.232
team Two has a man down!

35:31.352 --> 35:32.198
Over.

35:32.318 --> 35:33.498
Who we got, Pappy?

35:33.659 --> 35:35.081
Ah, it's just my foot!

35:35.201 --> 35:36.189
I got you, bro.

35:36.309 --> 35:38.232
Hitman Two, what is the status?

35:38.352 --> 35:41.382
I say again, what is the status
of your man down? Over.

35:44.629 --> 35:46.379
I've been hit in the foot.

35:55.006 --> 35:56.556
Change your magazines!

35:56.886 --> 35:58.775
- I'm out!
- Gunny, we need to withdraw!

35:59.482 --> 36:01.532
We need to back it up the way...

36:01.698 --> 36:03.237
Back it up the way we came in!

36:04.800 --> 36:06.072
Get this shit up!

36:06.233 --> 36:07.615
Christeson, hold your sector!

36:07.735 --> 36:08.784
On the left!

36:09.811 --> 36:12.278
- Get your weapons up!
- Pick up your rate of fire!

36:12.398 --> 36:13.786
Shift left, shift left!

36:13.906 --> 36:16.918
Motherfucker!
Turn it around. I'll be right back!

36:17.468 --> 36:21.235
Baptista, turn it around now!
We engaged! Turn now!

36:24.427 --> 36:26.532
Don't shoot. Lt. is foot-mobile.

36:28.648 --> 36:31.285
Up onto the berm, hard right, then go!

36:31.405 --> 36:32.455
Roger that!

36:38.599 --> 36:42.278
Billy, you need to back up
onto the berm, hard right, follow rudy.

36:42.398 --> 36:45.548
- Rudy, is that Espera to our left?
- I'm in, Pappy.

36:46.679 --> 36:49.623
- Who's to our left?
- That's Espera. He's trying to turn!

36:49.743 --> 36:52.532
- Garza, how's it looking?
- Sergeant, we're clear to our six!

36:52.652 --> 36:53.502
Go slow!

36:56.143 --> 36:57.173
Talk to me, Walt!

36:57.293 --> 36:58.943
Clear! Okay, go go!

36:59.153 --> 37:01.903
<i>- Clear on the right! Go!
- Two One peeling.</i>

37:02.873 --> 37:05.835
<i>All Victors, push past Bravo Three's
position and hold.</i>

37:05.955 --> 37:07.178
<i>Break, break!</i>

37:07.298 --> 37:09.387
<i>Two Two,
what is Echo Five Bravo's status?</i>

37:10.039 --> 37:12.378
We've stopped the bleeding.
He's stable.

37:12.883 --> 37:15.059
<i>Break. What's the status
of the Cas-evac? Over.</i>

37:16.721 --> 37:17.725
<i>Standby!</i>

37:23.730 --> 37:25.653
<i>Hitman Two Actual, this is Two Three.</i>

37:25.813 --> 37:26.978
<i>All vehicles are up.</i>

37:27.098 --> 37:28.404
<i>Push, push, push!</i>

38:04.007 --> 38:05.580
Check the tires, Ray.

38:12.682 --> 38:13.760
Jesus Christ.

38:20.401 --> 38:23.919
Did you know people shiver
when they have an excess of adrenaline?

38:24.039 --> 38:26.230
It cuts the blood flow or something.

38:26.350 --> 38:28.381
They taught us that in S.O.I.

38:30.503 --> 38:32.320
Is that what happens to you?

38:32.446 --> 38:33.247
No.

38:34.216 --> 38:35.379
I get a woody.

38:42.670 --> 38:44.335
Pappy, man, I'm so sorry.

38:44.900 --> 38:45.724
Rude.

38:45.844 --> 38:46.525
Yeah?

38:47.165 --> 38:49.535
- Where's my cope?
- Sgt. Patrick,

38:49.655 --> 38:51.651
you're late for your Medevac.

38:53.643 --> 38:54.862
All right, go.

38:55.036 --> 38:56.216
Good luck, pappy.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.626
I got you covered.

39:11.533 --> 39:13.213
You're team leader now.

39:16.299 --> 39:18.944
Get your Victor up.
We're moving out again soon.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.403
Lt, sir.

39:31.088 --> 39:33.677
- He refused to get Cas-evaced.
- I don't want him if he's ineffective.

39:33.797 --> 39:36.459
I took a Shrapnel of his thigh,
but it missed the femoral artery.

39:36.579 --> 39:38.035
He tourniqueted himself, sir.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.952
Got back up on his weapon
and returned fire.

39:41.072 --> 39:44.265
Boom, boom.
I was taking *** with flurry of ***

39:44.822 --> 39:45.793
...sir.

39:51.456 --> 39:52.689
Screwby, sir.

40:24.543 --> 40:25.986
The great destroyers.

40:26.252 --> 40:27.698
Yeah, L.A.Vs rock.

40:28.273 --> 40:31.455
Pouring down hate
and discontent like a motherfucker.

40:34.743 --> 40:36.397
Get your team ready, Poke.

40:37.113 --> 40:39.263
Lt. wants us Oscar Mike
when they finish.

40:39.657 --> 40:43.198
When they finish fucking shit up
there might not even be a bridge.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.675
We're linking up with bravo three ahead.

40:56.795 --> 40:58.808
- They are on point.
- All right.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.683
I want 15 meters between
their last Humvee and ours.

41:03.783 --> 41:05.831
Why aren't they sending tanks
over the bridge first?

41:06.019 --> 41:09.418
'Cause they don't know how strong
the bridge is, if it'll even hold tanks.

41:10.063 --> 41:11.208
What if it's mined?

41:11.328 --> 41:14.400
That's exactly why they're sending us.
I mean, come on, dude.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.040
You don't want to risk a $5,000,000 tank

41:17.160 --> 41:19.512
when you can send
a piece-of-crap Humvee.

41:20.590 --> 41:23.182
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
Hitman Three is Oscar Mike ahead of us.</i>

41:23.342 --> 41:24.612
<i>Let's move out.</i>

41:25.865 --> 41:26.899
<i>Let's go.</i>

41:29.388 --> 41:30.738
Wake up, Trombley!

41:38.868 --> 41:40.923
<i>All Hitman Victors, this is Hitman.</i>

41:41.114 --> 41:43.146
<i>War pig has suppressed targets
at the bridge,</i>

41:43.266 --> 41:46.716
<i>and tanks have blown barriers
at the bridge approach. Over.</i>

41:47.315 --> 41:49.402
<i>This is Hitman Three. Roger that.</i>

41:49.522 --> 41:51.752
<i>Hitman. This is Hitman Two Actual.
Roger that.</i>

42:01.764 --> 42:03.579
Dirty, right through the town!

42:03.752 --> 42:05.349
Contact left! R.P.G!

42:11.073 --> 42:13.706
<i>All Hitman. Shift east, 50 meters.</i>

42:28.779 --> 42:29.607
Fuck!

42:33.168 --> 42:34.239
We're stuck!

42:37.499 --> 42:40.768
<i>All Hitman Three Victors,
vehicle two is stuck. Over.</i>

42:41.170 --> 42:43.551
Put in four low.
Get us the fuck out of here!

42:43.671 --> 42:44.967
It's not going in!

42:45.163 --> 42:46.613
Piece-of-shit Humvee!

42:48.495 --> 42:50.057
<i>Hitman, this is Hitman Three.</i>

42:50.177 --> 42:53.027
<i>Relay to twisting,
good effects on target. Break.</i>

42:53.498 --> 42:55.649
<i>R.P.G. team destroyed. Over.</i>

42:56.191 --> 42:57.979
<i>Hitman Three, this is Hitman.</i>

42:58.395 --> 43:00.093
<i>Solid copy. Roger on relay.</i>

43:01.435 --> 43:02.531
<i>Hitman Three.</i>

43:02.691 --> 43:04.739
<i>Enrage Four One established H.A. Susan.</i>

43:04.859 --> 43:06.491
<i>Still waiting for B.D.A.</i>

43:07.045 --> 43:08.817
<i>Twisting copies. Stand by.</i>

43:09.999 --> 43:12.606
<i>Enrage Four One, R.P.G. Team destroyed.</i>

43:13.827 --> 43:15.505
<i>Enrage Four One copies all.</i>

43:16.504 --> 43:18.303
Two Actual, this is Two One.

43:18.423 --> 43:21.539
We have four Hitman Three Victors
halted on the bridge.

43:21.659 --> 43:23.068
<i>This is Hitman Two Actual.</i>

43:23.188 --> 43:24.207
<i>Solid copy.</i>

43:29.003 --> 43:31.018
Did one of their Humvees make it?

43:32.822 --> 43:35.043
<i>Hitman Three, this is Hitman Three Two.</i>

43:35.163 --> 43:36.450
<i>We're in the town.</i>

43:36.758 --> 43:38.817
<i>We observe no enemy activity
at this time.</i>

43:38.977 --> 43:39.782
<i>Break.</i>

43:39.902 --> 43:42.024
<i>We're still trying
to locate a route through.</i>

43:42.144 --> 43:44.537
<i>Movement's restricted due to debris.
Over.</i>

43:49.828 --> 43:51.664
<i>Hitman Three, you copy my last?</i>

43:51.891 --> 43:54.055
Redman, how close is Hitman Three?

43:56.769 --> 43:57.580
Fuck.

44:01.630 --> 44:02.878
He ain't bleeding.

44:02.998 --> 44:04.748
His neck don't look broken.

44:04.868 --> 44:06.095
We lost the platoon.

44:06.629 --> 44:09.515
<i>All Hitman Victors,
this is Hitman Three Actual.</i>

44:09.675 --> 44:11.327
This is Hitman Three Actual.

44:11.447 --> 44:13.769
The bridge is partially destroyed!
We're trapped!

44:14.382 --> 44:16.166
<i>I say again, we are fucking trapped!</i>

44:16.286 --> 44:20.281
Militarily speaking, Kocher,
ain't we the only ones that are trapped?

44:21.901 --> 44:23.263
Back the fuck up.

44:39.269 --> 44:41.547
- Where is Hitman Actual?
- That way, sir.

44:42.844 --> 44:44.523
Roll it over to company.

44:47.088 --> 44:49.088
...Tet offensive. Bullshit!

44:49.336 --> 44:50.704
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

44:50.824 --> 44:52.891
I got some good men dying in there!

44:53.218 --> 44:54.560
Hold your sectors, men!

44:54.720 --> 44:57.646
Break. Hitman Two, Hitman Two,
we need to back these Humvees back...

44:57.806 --> 44:58.890
Give me your radio.

44:59.010 --> 45:01.017
There's one thing I learned
in ranger school...

45:01.137 --> 45:03.556
- Hand it to me.
- ... we must seize initiative.

45:03.676 --> 45:05.248
Keep your eyes on those reeds.

45:05.368 --> 45:08.128
They could be massing
a suicide R.P.G. team as we speak.

45:08.248 --> 45:11.028
We don't know.
Any movement in there, you...

45:15.611 --> 45:17.484
What the hell is going on here?

45:19.059 --> 45:20.468
We were, we're...

45:21.960 --> 45:23.650
The stuck vehicle, it...

45:24.308 --> 45:25.247
Stuck.

45:25.605 --> 45:28.510
I got my best Marines cut off
in that town, dying in there!

45:29.268 --> 45:30.125
Craig,

45:30.842 --> 45:33.682
Godfather needs to unfuck
this clusterfuck now.

45:39.193 --> 45:41.997
We need to think of this
as a defensive line,

45:42.117 --> 45:43.749
and a goal-line stand.

45:46.646 --> 45:48.238
And you're the offense, Craig.

45:50.063 --> 45:52.329
You need to be a hard charger here.

45:53.562 --> 45:55.650
Put some fuckin' muscle into it.

46:04.724 --> 46:05.528
Men!

46:06.177 --> 46:07.007
Over here!

46:12.494 --> 46:14.262
Two-minute warning, guys,

46:14.567 --> 46:16.093
two-minute warning!

46:28.972 --> 46:29.791
Yeah!

46:30.430 --> 46:31.238
Yeah!

46:33.197 --> 46:34.826
<i>...this is Hitman.</i>

46:35.155 --> 46:36.605
<i>Bridge is all clear.</i>

46:36.768 --> 46:37.590
Sir,

46:38.083 --> 46:40.457
you did a favor by taking my radio
from me.

46:43.360 --> 46:44.368
Gentlemen,

46:45.666 --> 46:47.298
this is the end zone!

46:54.381 --> 46:55.934
Go yellowjackets!

46:57.337 --> 47:00.132
How's it feel now,
you filthy motherfuckers?

47:00.566 --> 47:04.062
God damn dirty haji motherfuckers
trying to fuck with me?

47:04.182 --> 47:05.168
Fuck you!

47:05.520 --> 47:08.400
That's what you get when you try
to ambush Marines, motherfucker!

47:08.520 --> 47:09.749
You get dead!

47:10.195 --> 47:11.499
Son of a bitch!

47:50.523 --> 47:51.329
Sir,

47:51.983 --> 47:53.405
get a load of this.

47:54.519 --> 47:56.533
They don't look like Iraqi regulars.

48:00.657 --> 48:03.651
Looks like he could have been
a college student.

48:15.921 --> 48:17.513
We've got a wounded enemy.

48:18.147 --> 48:19.171
Shoot him!

48:28.379 --> 48:29.691
Can you help this man?

48:29.993 --> 48:31.902
He could be booby-trapped, sir.

48:33.549 --> 48:34.990
I'll search him, sir.

48:41.992 --> 48:44.837
Because of this dying motherfucker
and his dead friends,

48:44.957 --> 48:46.962
we're eight hours behind schedule.

48:53.206 --> 48:54.863
Look at this motherfucker.

48:55.502 --> 48:57.448
Roll him over and check his back.

48:58.561 --> 49:00.052
He's all yours, doc.

49:14.090 --> 49:15.159
Amphetamine,

49:15.546 --> 49:17.214
pretty high-grade shit.

49:22.310 --> 49:23.142
Dude,

49:23.724 --> 49:25.391
these are Syrian pounds.

49:26.965 --> 49:27.958
Syrian passport.

49:32.257 --> 49:33.687
Ahmed Al Zari,

49:33.807 --> 49:35.090
born in Damascus,

49:35.210 --> 49:36.244
age 26,

49:36.888 --> 49:38.969
entered Iraq... march 23.

49:39.366 --> 49:40.596
Three days after we came.

49:41.044 --> 49:44.057
His address in Iraq is the...
Palestine Hotel in Baghdad.

49:45.544 --> 49:48.874
Restaurant is two-star,
but room service is out of this world.

49:48.994 --> 49:51.727
And if you go around the corner,
there's a club where the ladies go,

49:51.847 --> 49:55.110
- just... say you're a friend of Uday's.
- What does the rest of it say?

49:57.038 --> 49:58.949
"Purpose for entering Iraq:

49:59.232 --> 50:00.082
"jihad. "

50:03.667 --> 50:05.929
He put "jihad" at passport control.

50:06.865 --> 50:08.776
That's some wicked shit,

50:09.800 --> 50:12.250
some evildoing shit, if you ask me, man.

50:14.935 --> 50:16.381
They're coming here to fight us.

50:19.211 --> 50:21.637
I wonder if President Bush
will ever find out about this.

50:23.695 --> 50:27.578
It's what the president's been talking
about with the war on terrorists.

50:28.861 --> 50:30.511
This is why we're here.

51:14.067 --> 51:15.717
Go on, man, fuck it up.

51:26.429 --> 51:28.601
The fuck is wrong with you, Dawg?

51:31.010 --> 51:32.863
What is it with you white boys?

51:32.983 --> 51:35.919
Leave you alone for 10 minutes,
you go all "lord of the flies" and shit.

51:44.546 --> 51:45.985
What up, yo?

51:48.801 --> 51:50.640
Holy fucking shit, dude.

51:55.872 --> 51:56.898
Unreal.

51:58.859 --> 52:00.484
Rude, check it out.
I'm you.

52:00.673 --> 52:02.529
Here, dead.

52:03.101 --> 52:03.989
Alive.

52:04.430 --> 52:06.488
I'm dead here.
Now I'm alive.

52:06.902 --> 52:09.286
- I'm dead. Alive. Dead.
- Ray.

52:09.735 --> 52:10.787
What's your point?

52:11.828 --> 52:14.178
Just trying to cheer you up, brother.

52:18.037 --> 52:18.987
Fucking unreal.

52:19.107 --> 52:21.815
I'm putting you in Trombley's
seat when we move out.

52:21.935 --> 52:23.385
You need some rest.

52:24.302 --> 52:25.452
I'm okay Brad.

52:26.228 --> 52:29.531
Trombley slept a couple
of hours last night. You didn't.

52:30.584 --> 52:33.156
I want you in some shade
inside the Humvee.

52:36.866 --> 52:39.608
Lt's boys are eating
some weird-ass meat over there.

52:39.769 --> 52:41.818
It's like Jeffrey Dahmer's picnic.

52:42.279 --> 52:44.115
Makes you appreciate shit...

52:44.506 --> 52:46.575
Makes you appreciate shit like...

52:48.076 --> 52:49.868
good old-fashioned

52:50.029 --> 52:52.184
chunked, formed meat patties.

52:59.172 --> 53:02.408
That was some fucking true
Iceman shit you pulled last night.

53:03.491 --> 53:07.259
Your superhuman powers of observation
saved the whole platoon.

53:08.135 --> 53:09.054
Shit, Dawg

53:09.813 --> 53:12.620
they thought they were gonna
get the drop on Iceman?

53:12.740 --> 53:13.740
Fuck no.

53:14.239 --> 53:17.395
The Iceman can see you before
you even know you're there.

53:17.515 --> 53:19.859
Those guys were untrained amateurs.

53:20.835 --> 53:21.803
Oh yeah?

53:23.056 --> 53:24.635
How come we didn't see them?

53:24.755 --> 53:26.505
You're not as good as me.

53:30.606 --> 53:33.328
What kind of goddamn sadists
work at the M.R.E. factory?

53:35.367 --> 53:37.602
10 days and nothing but peanut butter.

53:38.410 --> 53:40.523
When the fuck am I going
to get a jalapeno and cheese?

53:40.643 --> 53:42.294
I'm allergic to peanuts.

53:43.961 --> 53:45.474
How's everybody doing?

53:47.423 --> 53:49.083
It's just the same every day now.

53:49.203 --> 53:50.761
Dig a hole,

53:51.129 --> 53:51.979
eat,...

53:52.739 --> 53:53.996
- kill.
- And jack off.

53:54.116 --> 53:56.410
Be nice to add some sleep into the mix.

53:59.538 --> 54:01.187
You know funny thing is...

54:01.307 --> 54:04.599
I would done anything to save
those shepherds trombley hit.

54:04.967 --> 54:08.068
Yesterday I musta killed two,
maybe three guys.

54:08.805 --> 54:09.906
I don't feel nothing.

54:11.094 --> 54:12.344
Me neither Dawg.

54:12.965 --> 54:15.494
I shot some motherfucker
right in the grape,

54:15.655 --> 54:17.805
saw the back of his head bust off.

54:18.308 --> 54:19.498
I don't feel nothing.

54:21.411 --> 54:24.461
- Is this how true warriors feel?
- Don't fool yourself.

54:26.023 --> 54:28.120
We aren't being warriors out here.

54:28.638 --> 54:31.288
They're just using us
as machine operators,

54:32.418 --> 54:34.133
semiskilled labor.

54:36.500 --> 54:37.994
T.Is over here.

54:38.414 --> 54:39.964
Just about ready, Sir.

54:53.897 --> 54:55.345
The news on Pappy is good.

54:55.465 --> 54:57.287
This morning he was taken to the R.C.T.

54:57.448 --> 54:59.456
shock-trauma,
where they loaded him onto a bird.

54:59.813 --> 55:02.563
He's on his way to
a navy hospital in Spain.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.215
Back at Camp Mathilda, Pappy once said,

55:07.721 --> 55:09.399
"Don't pet a burning dog. "

55:11.705 --> 55:14.568
I had nodea what he meant
by that until 12 hours ago.

55:17.412 --> 55:19.381
Last night we pet a burning dog.

55:19.695 --> 55:21.226
I know it. You know it.

55:22.065 --> 55:23.730
There's no use in pretending we didn't.

55:24.285 --> 55:26.224
That's very astute, Sir.

55:31.705 --> 55:33.342
We step off in 30 minutes.

55:35.463 --> 55:38.668
Our route is taking us through
the center of Muwaffaqiyah,

55:38.891 --> 55:40.705
the town we almost
made it to last night.

55:41.123 --> 55:42.749
But isn't the bridge damaged, Sir?

55:42.910 --> 55:44.501
There's an alternate route.

55:50.811 --> 55:52.592
I think we can take it from here, Sir.

55:56.139 --> 55:57.440
Thank you, Gents.

55:57.560 --> 55:59.610
I got new map sheets of the A.O.

56:01.125 --> 56:02.875
We did pet a burning dog.

56:03.937 --> 56:05.487
In more ways than one.

56:07.015 --> 56:09.065
Those jihadists who attacked us?

56:11.081 --> 56:13.613
Isn't this the exact opposite
of what we want to have happen here?

56:14.438 --> 56:17.701
It's all on that guy's passport. 2 weeks
ago he was still a student in syria.

56:18.900 --> 56:21.347
He wasn't a jihadi
until we came to Iraq.

56:50.996 --> 56:54.090
<i>Hitman Two.
Something is loose in your vehicle.</i>

56:54.210 --> 56:55.548
<i>Roger that.</i>

57:04.135 --> 57:07.212
Ray, in about one klik
we'll hit the cutoff to the town.

57:09.396 --> 57:12.492
Why didn't we go this way last night?

57:14.250 --> 57:16.313
You're not thinking military, dude.

57:16.721 --> 57:19.103
See, bypassing the ambush

57:19.223 --> 57:22.050
is just what the ambushers
expected us to do.

57:26.970 --> 57:29.564
If they expected us to bypass them,

57:29.725 --> 57:31.701
why did they set up the ambush?

57:31.821 --> 57:34.291
Because they're not
professional military.

57:38.283 --> 57:39.490
Slow down, Ray.

57:42.625 --> 57:45.914
Shit, those could be more
of those dudes we fought last night.

57:52.724 --> 57:54.628
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

57:55.178 --> 57:57.634
On our two o'clock we are passing
a group of foot-mobiles,

57:58.368 --> 58:01.721
all male, early 20s, definitely
not from around here.

58:02.082 --> 58:05.112
I strongly request permission to set
up a snatch mission on them.

58:05.232 --> 58:06.101
How copy?

58:06.552 --> 58:07.514
<i>Stand by.</i>

58:11.447 --> 58:12.513
<i>This is two actual.</i>

58:12.633 --> 58:14.983
<i>Our request for a snatch
has been denied. Over.</i>

58:15.732 --> 58:17.482
Roger. Thanks for trying.

58:18.668 --> 58:20.198
Jesus, look at all that ordnance.

58:25.011 --> 58:26.578
This looks like jihad central.

58:28.295 --> 58:29.542
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,</i>

58:29.662 --> 58:32.127
<i>we are to proceed to our objective
as per Godfather's orders.</i>

59:05.527 --> 59:08.476
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two.</i>

59:08.958 --> 59:10.390
<i>Hold your sectors.</i>

59:12.953 --> 59:13.999
It's weird.

59:14.598 --> 59:17.754
We had one guy shot
in the foot and another guy

59:17.874 --> 59:21.634
take a little shrapnel in the leg,
and we level half the town.

59:21.886 --> 59:23.317
Hajis gotta learn.

59:32.471 --> 59:34.430
<i>Hitman Two One,
the M.S.R. that we're blocking</i>

59:34.550 --> 59:36.601
<i>is on the northeast corner of the town.</i>

59:36.721 --> 59:38.151
<i>Push through to that point.</i>

59:38.659 --> 59:39.609
Copy that.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.812
Ray, push through to the edge of town.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.782
We're setting up a roadblock.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.522
Hey, you got that camera working again?
I thought that shit was dead.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:04.344
Yeah.

01:00:22.497 --> 01:00:24.614
We got team three accompanying engineers

01:00:24.775 --> 01:00:27.522
to check out
a Ba'ath military installation.

01:00:28.039 --> 01:00:28.989
Cool cool.

01:00:37.061 --> 01:00:38.294
We got kids up the alley.

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:41.456
Don't shoot.

01:00:42.497 --> 01:00:43.757
They're just curious.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:12.104
Republican guard took
over every classroom.

01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:14.833
Now we get to blow up a school.

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:18.418
This is every fourth-grade
boy's fantasy.

01:01:18.954 --> 01:01:21.116
We know kids were here until february.

01:01:25.459 --> 01:01:26.757
Now that's freaky.

01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:31.306
Yeah. Why'd these kids draw
little girls with blonde hair?

01:01:32.078 --> 01:01:34.720
Saddam was even trying
to steal our holiday.

01:01:35.207 --> 01:01:36.857
That's fucking twisted.

01:01:44.947 --> 01:01:46.022
Oh, shit.

01:01:47.002 --> 01:01:48.990
I don't like it when
civilians flee, Dawg.

01:01:58.683 --> 01:01:59.712
Brad.

01:02:01.111 --> 01:02:02.617
Meesh has debriefed some locals

01:02:02.737 --> 01:02:06.536
who say jihadists are planning
to attack us with suicide bombers.

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:09.260
Soon as Team Three gets back, we're
clearing the town and pushing north.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:10.630
Roger that, Sir.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.107
What are you doing
with that smoke grenade?

01:02:14.227 --> 01:02:15.927
What we discussed yesterday, Sir.

01:02:16.047 --> 01:02:18.156
New procedure for stopping cars.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:21.033
Charlie has already
started using blue smoke.

01:02:21.153 --> 01:02:22.711
I don't like this, Brad.

01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:25.276
We fire the smoke grenade
100 meters distant.

01:02:26.037 --> 01:02:27.911
If it's bad guys,
we have time to light 'em up.

01:02:28.031 --> 01:02:29.819
We've got reports of suicide bombers.

01:02:29.939 --> 01:02:32.589
We can still kill
the cars that don't stop.

01:02:33.291 --> 01:02:34.869
This just gives civilians a chance.

01:02:38.401 --> 01:02:39.623
I'm asking, Sir.

01:02:41.274 --> 01:02:43.124
You do have power over this.

01:02:48.019 --> 01:02:49.040
All right.

01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:52.073
We got a vehicle.

01:03:00.953 --> 01:03:03.203
Don't fire unless they drive through

01:03:04.099 --> 01:03:05.568
and I give the order.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.063
You turned him, Sergeant.

01:03:16.321 --> 01:03:18.471
No shit, you obvious motherfucker.

01:03:28.321 --> 01:03:31.709
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two Three.</i>

01:03:31.919 --> 01:03:34.178
<i>Controlled det in 10, 9...</i>

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:39.267
We got a controlled det in five, four,

01:03:39.826 --> 01:03:40.804
three,

01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:42.694
two, one.

01:03:51.399 --> 01:03:53.912
Why'd we leave that ordinance
out in the field if we're gonna blow up

01:03:54.032 --> 01:03:56.095
the only school in this town?

01:03:57.142 --> 01:03:58.452
Am I missing something?

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.751
Got another one coming at us.

01:04:14.962 --> 01:04:15.928
Fuck, Walt!

01:04:19.782 --> 01:04:21.476
You didn't even fire a warning shot.

01:04:24.906 --> 01:04:27.264
That was a wounding shot, motherfucker!

01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:36.742
You okay?

01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:39.534
The car kept coming.

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:44.580
Yeah.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:51.501
Come on.

01:04:56.483 --> 01:04:57.469
Sit down.

01:05:01.156 --> 01:05:02.406
It's all right.

01:05:10.142 --> 01:05:11.955
Holy shit. Check it out.

01:05:17.096 --> 01:05:19.822
That's some real rob zombie shit, man.

01:05:20.995 --> 01:05:22.121
Nice shooting.

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:27.785
We're just doing our jobs.

01:05:48.243 --> 01:05:51.704
All Hitman Victors,
the battalion has cleared Muwaffaqiyah.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:54.441
We are to advance
up to al kut immediately.

01:06:03.732 --> 01:06:04.776
Mount up.

01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:07.824
We're Oscar Mike.

01:06:13.205 --> 01:06:14.755
We're Oscar Mike!
