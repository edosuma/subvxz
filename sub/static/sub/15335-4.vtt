THERE'S NO NUCLEAR
STORAGE FACILITY ANYWHERE
INSIDE THAT PERIMETER.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.774
[ Bob ]
THAT MEANS THE MATERIAL'S
NOT STATIONARY.

A MOVING TARGET.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.423

SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL RODS...

31:31.457 --> 31:34.126

HEADING FOR CALIFORNIA.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.128
CROSSES SAN DIEGO
IN 30 MINUTES.

31:36.162 --> 31:39.298
CAN YOU STOP IT?
THESE TRAINS ARE
PROTECTED BY D.O.E.,

31:39.331 --> 31:42.034
AND WE'VE RECEIVED
NO INDICATION
OF AN ATTACK.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.203
ONCE MY TEAM IDENTIFIES
THE LOCATION OF THE BOMB?
NO.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.405
THEY'D HAVE TO PROVE
THAT THE BOMB'S NOT A DECOY.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.141
IT'S D.O.E. POLICY.
A MOVING TARGET'S
HARDER TO HIT.

31:49.175 --> 31:52.244
MORE DANGEROUS TO STOP THE TRAIN
AND CREATE A SITTING
NUCLEAR TARGET.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.047
WE COULD SEND AGENTS
FROM ALL MAJOR CITIES
ALONG THE TRAIN ROUTE.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.483

TARGET SITE'S JUST
OUTSIDE OF SAN DIEGO.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.819
NOW, WHY WOULD RAUL
PLANT A BOMB
IN A DESOLATE AREA?

32:00.852 --> 32:02.955
BECAUSE IT IS
A DESOLATE AREA.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.824

32:08.160 --> 32:12.131
A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION OUTSIDE
SAN DIEGO IS ONLY GONNA
TAKE OUT 50 MILES OF FARMLAND.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.133
IT'S GONNA DO
MORE DAMAGE THAN THAT.

EXISTING WIND CURRENTS
ARE MOVING NORTHEAST,
CARRYING RADIOACTIVE TOXINS.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.240
IT'S GONNA BLANKET
EVERYTHING IN 500 MILES
WITH RADIOACTIVE RESIDUE.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.309

TO HIT A MOVING TRAIN?

- FORTIFIED ON THREE SIDES,
