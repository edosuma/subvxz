02:19.056 --> 02:21.892
Well done, Jerry Mouse.
Thanks for the rope.

02:24.395 --> 02:25.563
I'll take it from here.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.066
Ha-ha!

02:34.155 --> 02:36.323
Don't move a muscle, friend.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.576
Here now, I'd say that was a job well done.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.913
Now, let's see. What have we here?

02:43.372 --> 02:45.082
Ah, gold.

02:45.749 --> 02:46.917
All this...

02:47.376 --> 02:49.962
...taxed from the poor
so that the rich can get richer.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.714
It simply will not do.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.924
Oh, yes, it will.

02:54.091 --> 02:58.262
The famous Robin Hood
caught in my little trap.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.847
How pathetic.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.268
Not as pathetic as you,
Sheriff of Nothingham.

03:08.564 --> 03:10.024
It's Nottingham.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.901
And you are my prisoner.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.110
- Oh.
- Aah!

03:13.569 --> 03:15.112
Is that a fact?

03:15.613 --> 03:18.115
Aah! Aah! Ooh! Aah! OW!

03:18.282 --> 03:20.075
You there, driver. Seize him.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.953
Yes, you.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.747
Grab Robin Hood.

03:24.914 --> 03:29.752
I'm afraid he won't be doing that.
He's actually one of my men, Little John.

03:29.919 --> 03:30.920
Huh?

03:31.086 --> 03:35.549
- He hijacked your wagon about, what...?
- Ooh, five miles back.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.093
It's still 10 to 2.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.056
Two and one-sixteenth.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.142
I'd say more like 10 to 50.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.146
No. Good grief.

03:50.981 --> 03:55.486
Thanks to a wee bird,
or, rather, a tiny mouse...

03:55.653 --> 03:59.740
...I knew you were planning a little trap for me
so I planned a little trap for you.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.952
So nice of you to use
real gold as bait, my lord.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.080
- Tie them up.
- Huh?

04:06.997 --> 04:09.500
Not you, Jerry.
Let the men do that.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.878
You and Little John can help me
roll these barrels of gold back home.

04:13.045 --> 04:16.798
Perfect job for your tiny little feet.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.638
This one's for you, little buddy.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.936
Thanks again, sheriff.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.775
Oh! I hate you, Robin Hood.

05:32.916 --> 05:38.422
Oh, it's a rough life just trying to get by

05:38.589 --> 05:43.427
The tax man comes and bleeds you dry

05:43.594 --> 05:47.681
No matter how much you give
It's never enough

05:47.848 --> 05:50.559
If you say you've nothing left
He'll say

05:50.726 --> 05:52.186
That's tough

05:52.353 --> 05:55.606
It's a rough life just trying to get by

05:56.023 --> 06:02.279
The tax man comes and

06:03.614 --> 06:04.615
Aah!

06:06.367 --> 06:07.951
He bleeds you dry

06:08.410 --> 06:11.789
That's why we fight
We fight for Robin Hood

06:11.955 --> 06:15.459
Robin stands for right
He fights for all that's good

06:15.626 --> 06:17.461
That is why they stand

06:17.628 --> 06:19.296
To join my merry band

06:19.463 --> 06:23.050
We are merry men and that is grand

06:23.217 --> 06:26.637
The good king's left on a long Crusade

06:26.804 --> 06:30.099
While he's gone
He has been betrayed

06:30.265 --> 06:33.685
His brother John is a greedy soul

06:33.852 --> 06:37.481
<i>- He'll tax your soup
- And he'll tax your bowl</i>

06:37.648 --> 06:39.316
But fear not, good folk

06:39.483 --> 06:40.984
Listen and behold

06:41.151 --> 06:43.195
Robin Hood will thwart him

06:44.571 --> 06:46.365
With action brave and bold

06:46.532 --> 06:50.160
That's why we fight
We fight for Robin Hood

06:50.327 --> 06:53.539
Robin stands for right
He fights for all that's good

06:53.705 --> 06:57.668
He takes from the rich
And to the poor he gives

06:57.835 --> 07:07.177
And with his merry men
In Sherwood Forest lives

07:09.138 --> 07:12.015
Aah...!

07:12.182 --> 07:13.517
Whoo! Aah! Aah!

07:13.684 --> 07:17.938
Whoo! Aah! Whoo! Aah!
Whoo! Aah! Whoo!

07:20.441 --> 07:22.443
My dear sheriff...

07:23.777 --> 07:27.030
...perhaps you have forgotten
one very important thing.

07:27.197 --> 07:31.034
I not only love money,
love it, love it, love it...

07:31.201 --> 07:32.369
...but I need it.

07:33.829 --> 07:36.039
I'm going to be King John one day...

07:37.875 --> 07:39.710
- ...not Prince John.
- Yes, my lord.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.921
And a king needs to be rich. Mm!

07:43.088 --> 07:46.550
Rich. Heh-heh-heh. Stinking rich!

07:46.717 --> 07:48.385
Yes, my lord.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.597
And I can't be stinking rich...

07:51.763 --> 07:56.143
...unless you stop Robin Hood
from stealing all my taxes.

07:56.310 --> 08:00.147
What does he do with my money?
Gives it to the poor?

08:00.314 --> 08:04.234
What's up with that?
The poor don't need money.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.069
They're poor.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.074
Well, it's not my fault, sire.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.744
I think... How do I put this?

08:14.161 --> 08:18.207
Robin Hood is getting his information
from inside the castle.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.001
A spy?

08:22.961 --> 08:27.382
Prince John, if you will excuse me,
I'd like to retire.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.513
You know how matters of state
are too much for my sweet little head.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.058
Yes, yes, off you go.
Good night, Maid Marion.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.616
Good night. Sweet dreams.

08:55.327 --> 08:59.206
Close your mouth.
You're as bad as the wolves.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.292
So we have a spy?

09:02.459 --> 09:06.171
Yes, I believe Robin Hood
is smuggling information back and forth...

09:06.338 --> 09:08.215
...via a very tiny courier.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.468
And I have just the man to stop him.

09:12.553 --> 09:16.765
- Him?
- No.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.476
- Uh, him?
- No.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.565
Silly sheriff, you're out of men.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.610
May I introduce my cat-at-arms, Thomas.

09:30.112 --> 09:33.031
You see, because Robin Hood
is using a mouse as his messenger...

09:33.198 --> 09:34.658
...Tom is perfect.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.620
Now off with you. Prepare for your mission.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.133
A cat to catch a mouse.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.303
Genius! Pure genius.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.179
I love money!

09:56.346 --> 09:58.515
Oh, the mouse is nothing, sire.

09:58.682 --> 10:02.603
What matters is with its capture,
we'll find the traitor.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.939
Yes. Find the traitor.

10:07.107 --> 10:13.196
But if my brother, the good King Richard,
returns from the Crusades...

10:13.363 --> 10:15.198
...it will all be for nothing.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.367
I'll never be king.

10:17.534 --> 10:22.039
The nice part about Crusades
is they're extremely dangerous.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.917
He may never return.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.718
How long before
we cross the Channel for England?

10:34.885 --> 10:41.725
Good King Richard, another two days
and the ship will be ready, uh, sire.

10:42.225 --> 10:46.647
But how I miss my kingdom and my people.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.899
The sooner we get home, the better.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.401
Eh, my good bear?

10:51.568 --> 10:57.407
Uh, oh, yeah.
Uh, what you just said, sire.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.578
Two days. We gotta warn Prince John.

11:01.745 --> 11:06.375
Yeah, so's he can definitely make a nice
reception for his big brother. Heh-heh.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.210
It'll be a killer.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.297
Shush! Come on.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.097
Let's go.

11:20.263 --> 11:25.852
We'll get ourselves a nice reward
for this juicy bit of news. Heh-heh.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.612
Oh, boy.

11:37.322 --> 11:41.576
Now, my fine lads, who wants to help me
hand out Prince John's money?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.453
Huzzah! Huzzah!

11:43.620 --> 11:46.289
Ha-ha! Grab your gear.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.261
Ha-ha. Not you, my little friend.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.013
- Youch!
- Oh, don't fret now.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.890
I have an even more important
job for you.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.518
Something that fits your size.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.980
I need you to make another delivery.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.024
It's a poem I've written for Maid Marion.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.651
Could you please take it to her?

12:16.987 --> 12:20.240
Now you mustn't let this fall
into the wrong hands...

12:20.407 --> 12:23.243
...for her sake more than mine.

12:30.208 --> 12:34.337
You see, son of mine,
your pops has a very important job.

12:34.504 --> 12:38.425
This here log boat is vital
to our whole operation.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.012
It's how we move around
without nobody being the wiser.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.516
That's why I can't let nobody
take the log boat.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.394
No way, no how.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.523
Hm. Uh--

14:16.690 --> 14:18.275
- Yoo-hoo
- H m?

14:18.441 --> 14:21.361
Big fella, I got something for you.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.301
What?

14:45.135 --> 14:46.428
Robin Hood!

14:47.012 --> 14:48.096
There!

15:00.901 --> 15:06.072
Oh, Thomas, I am simply
all nerves this evening.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.074
Would you play me a song?

15:16.458 --> 15:17.751
Ooh!

16:04.839 --> 16:07.717
Oh, Thomas, that was ever so lovely.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.345
Please play another, won't you?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.890
Hm. No encore?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.139
Aah!

18:06.461 --> 18:08.004
Aah!

20:04.037 --> 20:05.079
Aah!

20:23.223 --> 20:26.851
Aah!

21:03.304 --> 21:04.931
Oh! Heh-heh.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.767
What have we here, Sir Mouse?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.686
A message?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.771
From? My love.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.691
Oh, Robin Hood.

21:16.651 --> 21:20.822
Oh, dear. Oh-ho.
I can't quite make it out.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.218
It's a poem.

21:42.385 --> 21:47.724
My dearest Maid Marion
I love you more than spring flowers

21:47.890 --> 21:49.225
And the summer breeze

21:49.392 --> 21:51.477
And... cheese

21:53.187 --> 21:57.066
Oh, my beloved Robin.
He so loves his cheese.

21:58.860 --> 22:02.905
Here, take him this good luck charm
as a token of my affection.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.741
It will keep him safe.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.868
And I'll stay here inside the castle...

22:07.035 --> 22:11.039
...and keep him informed of anything
that the sheriff and Prince John are up to.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.875
Thank you, little mouse
for your brave service.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.418
Mm.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.095
Careful now.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.736
Ouch!

22:53.456 --> 22:57.043
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Oof!

22:57.794 --> 23:02.882
What if we had the peasants build
a giant statue of me holding money?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.552
Your cat-at-arms is dampening the fire.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.138
Isn't he supposed to be after that mouse?

23:09.305 --> 23:11.974
Yes. So sorry, sire.

23:12.141 --> 23:16.229
Problem is, Robin Hood has stolen
so much of the tax money...

23:16.396 --> 23:19.816
...that I might not have enough
for my statue.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.734
What are we going to do?

23:22.276 --> 23:28.574
Sire, what is the perfect bait
for the perfect trap, hm?

23:29.283 --> 23:31.869
- Ah!
- Besides money?

23:32.036 --> 23:37.834
Well, for you, a beautiful woman
who shall remain nameless.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.502
Maid Marion.

23:39.669 --> 23:44.132
And, for someone like Robin Hood,
to be crowned best archer in all of England.

23:44.298 --> 23:48.219
Perhaps we should offer him all three
at an archery tournament.

23:48.386 --> 23:51.013
Oh, well, that is good.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.551
Hey, you, that's royal property

24:28.718 --> 24:30.344
Come back here.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.686
Well, well, a royal archery contest.

24:38.853 --> 24:43.399
The winner is given a purse of gold
and crowned best archer in all of England.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.235
And he receives a kiss from Maid Marion.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.404
Oh, here we go.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.782
Gentlemen, I put it to you,
as the best archer in all of England...

24:51.949 --> 24:55.703
...I should be crowned as such
and win this purse of gold for the poor.

24:56.704 --> 24:57.747
Huzzah!

24:57.914 --> 25:00.416
And, of course, the grandest prize of all...

25:00.583 --> 25:04.921
...will be the moment where Maid Marion
rests her ruby reds...

25:05.087 --> 25:07.215
...resplendent with divine delights...

25:07.381 --> 25:10.593
...against my own,
bespeaking love...

25:10.760 --> 25:13.054
...without one word uttered.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.394
I get to smooch with my girlfriend.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.064
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah.

25:23.231 --> 25:26.192
That's Middle English for "hooray."

25:26.359 --> 25:28.444
You know it's probably a trap.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.780
You think that will stop Robin?

25:30.947 --> 25:33.533
They'll arrest you on sight, my boy.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.743
Worry not, my good friar.

25:35.910 --> 25:39.956
Lest you forget, I am a master of disguise.

25:43.793 --> 25:46.712
I have got a bad feeling about this.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.256
Keep it natural.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.634
Just blend in.

25:56.347 --> 26:00.059
Ah, what a beautiful day for a trap.
Heh-heh.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.479
Oh, yes, it is. Heh.

26:03.646 --> 26:08.401
Sire, you don't actually believe Robin Hood
would be foolish enough to show up today?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.152
Oh, yes.

26:10.319 --> 26:15.116
I think I know the mind of that scalawag
a little better than you, my dear.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.285
I fear you're right.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.997
Now let the games begin.

26:27.503 --> 26:30.798
Here, Jerry. Give Maid Marion this.
It's my lucky charm...

26:30.965 --> 26:33.718
...for her to replace the one she gave me.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.429
No? How about this then?

26:36.596 --> 26:39.307
That is a very lucky spoon.
It saved my life once.

26:39.473 --> 26:42.977
No? Then what?

26:48.190 --> 26:51.193
That is an excellent idea.
Well done, Jerry Mouse.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.225
Anybody seen my helmet?

28:03.808 --> 28:04.892
Ow!

28:23.411 --> 28:25.705
We have our two finalists!

28:25.871 --> 28:29.625
- The Sheriff of Nottingham...
- Psst. Psst. Psst.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.001
...and John of Smithtown.

28:32.336 --> 28:33.796
You're so lovely.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.425
Psst. Pss--

28:42.638 --> 28:45.307
Lovely. Heh-heh-heh.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.489
Hi. Heh-heh-heh.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.159
- Heh...
- Whoever's arrow...

29:03.325 --> 29:05.286
...comes closest to the bull's-eye...

29:05.453 --> 29:07.121
...will win the competition.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.165
After you.

29:17.047 --> 29:19.341
Dead center!

29:33.731 --> 29:35.191
Huh? Oh.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.611
A miss. The sheriff wins.

29:50.164 --> 29:51.540
- Wait a minute.
- Huh.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.697
We have a winner.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.533
- Huzzah!
- Heh-heh.

30:25.991 --> 30:29.370
I've come to claim my prize.
Especially the kiss.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.082
The only prize you'll be getting...

30:33.249 --> 30:36.502
...is the sharp edge
of the executioner's ax...

30:36.919 --> 30:38.087
...Robin Hood.
- Oh!

30:38.254 --> 30:39.338
Oh, no.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.389
This way, men.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.938
Oh, never mind.

31:04.446 --> 31:07.533
Well, now, men, it's, um...
It's not as bad as it looks.

31:07.700 --> 31:11.620
- It looks like we're all imprisoned.
- Being taken to the dungeon.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.622
To be executed on the morrow.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.750
When you say it like that,
I guess it is as bad as it looks.

31:29.054 --> 31:32.224
Will, look. It's Jerry Mouse.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.643
Here he comes.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.604
And there he goes.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.511
Ha-ha! Good fellow.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.347
Jerry, the lock.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.436
Can you open it'?

32:25.861 --> 32:26.987
- Huh?
- Oh...

32:50.469 --> 32:52.221
Well, third time's the charm.

33:03.065 --> 33:04.400
You've got it this time, Jerry.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.612
He's done it!

33:19.248 --> 33:22.167
Gallant try, dear mouse. Gallant try.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.021
Enjoy the slop, boys.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.607
Even though you'll be dead
before it's digested.

33:45.774 --> 33:49.486
- Right? Ha-ha-ha.
- Go on, have a laugh while you can.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.655
You must not know who you're dealing with.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.907
Isn't that right, Robin?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.285
Robin?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.287
Robin?

34:01.707 --> 34:04.793
He's always been there to help in time of need.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.213
Now who's gonna help Robin?

34:08.380 --> 34:11.842
I'm afraid you'd need an army
to get in there, my dear.

34:12.009 --> 34:16.096
It'll take a different sort of hero
to save Robin Hood.

34:33.697 --> 34:34.947
I'm sorry, men.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.659
Don't blame yourself, my son.

34:37.826 --> 34:41.163
It's because of me that we're in here.
And it's because of me that she's...

34:41.705 --> 34:43.581
...still up there instead of in my arms.

34:44.792 --> 34:47.168
Oh, my darling Marion.

34:48.045 --> 34:51.005
Oh, my dear, sweet Robin.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.842
Gazing from my window

34:54.009 --> 34:57.471
There you are

34:57.638 --> 35:03.852
You're so very close and yet so far

35:04.019 --> 35:10.692
When I see your face, dear
Then I know this much is true

35:10.859 --> 35:16.698
There's no other one for me but you

35:16.865 --> 35:23.038
No other love for me
No other one for me

35:23.205 --> 35:29.878
No other love for me
I know deep in my heart

35:30.045 --> 35:33.215
No other one for me

35:33.382 --> 35:37.469
No other love for me, it's true

35:37.636 --> 35:44.643
There's no other one for me but you

35:47.729 --> 35:50.190
Chained within this cell

35:50.357 --> 35:54.069
I dream of you

35:54.736 --> 36:00.534
Thoughts of all the scrapes
That we've been through

36:00.701 --> 36:07.040
Giving me the courage
For the fight that's sure to be

36:07.833 --> 36:12.796
There's no other hope for me, you see

36:12.963 --> 36:16.258
No other love for me

36:16.425 --> 36:19.511
No other one for me

36:19.678 --> 36:21.430
No other love for me

36:21.597 --> 36:22.890
I know

36:23.056 --> 36:26.226
- Deep in my heart
- Deep in my heart

36:26.393 --> 36:29.438
- No other one for me
- No other one for me

36:29.605 --> 36:34.234
- No other love for me, it's true
- No other love for me, it's true

36:35.360 --> 36:39.489
- Nothing's ever keeping us
- Nothing's ever keeping us

36:39.656 --> 36:47.873
- Apart
- Apart

36:56.924 --> 36:59.134
Oh, Jerry, this is terrible.

36:59.301 --> 37:02.095
Perhaps I should write Robin a note.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.723
There must be something we can do.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.656
Maid Marion.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.659
As the default winner
of the archery contest...

37:23.825 --> 37:27.287
...I believe I'm owed that kiss.

37:27.454 --> 37:28.789
What do you have there?

37:28.956 --> 37:30.958
Nothing, my lord.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.169
A letter? To Robin Hood?

37:34.336 --> 37:36.171
You're the SPY?

37:36.338 --> 37:38.423
That's right, you blackguard.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.927
Well, now you'll perish as a traitor.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.846
Unless... Hm...

37:45.013 --> 37:48.517
You know,
I could spare you from that fate...

37:48.684 --> 37:50.477
...if you agree to be my wife.

37:50.644 --> 37:54.189
I wouldn't marry you
if you were the last man on Earth...

37:54.356 --> 37:56.316
...Sheriff of Nothingham.

37:56.483 --> 38:00.362
It's-- It's Nottingham.
The Sheriff of Nottingham!

38:00.529 --> 38:02.698
Get it? Nottingham.

38:03.240 --> 38:07.119
Regardless, I would rather be finished off
by the executioner's ax...

38:07.286 --> 38:08.495
...than become your wife.

38:08.662 --> 38:12.958
That, fair maid, can and will be arranged.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.880
Guards!

38:19.589 --> 38:23.176
Let no one in or out.
If she tries to escape, finish her.

38:23.677 --> 38:28.098
Are you sure?
She's the only girl in this whole picture.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.602
Sire, we need to talk.

39:13.769 --> 39:18.523
In a moment.
My spies have just arrived from France.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.611
What news have you of my brother?

39:22.778 --> 39:24.738
Oh, it's terrible news, my liege.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.948
Very bad, definitely very bad.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.537
Yes, yes, not now, you stupid cat.

39:34.122 --> 39:38.293
- The king, Richard the Lionheart, returns.
- Definitely coming back.

39:38.460 --> 39:42.798
Even as we speak, he's on a ship
that lands in England tomorrow morn.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.966
Yeah, crack of dawn, definitely very early.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.428
The Crusades are over?

39:48.595 --> 39:50.222
Well, that was fast.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.100
Sire, if the king returns, we'll--

39:53.266 --> 39:55.727
I mean, you will lose all your power.

39:55.894 --> 40:00.732
And more importantly,
I'll have to move back into the guest castle...

40:01.233 --> 40:03.735
...without any of my money.

40:03.902 --> 40:07.906
Sire, perhaps my men and I
could meet the king at the shore...

40:08.073 --> 40:10.325
...and make sure he never returns.

40:10.492 --> 40:14.329
Oh. Heh. I would like to see that.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.706
I only have one request.

40:16.873 --> 40:21.670
When you have Robin Hood executed,
add Maid Marion to that list.

40:23.588 --> 40:26.049
- She was our spy.
- Really?

40:26.216 --> 40:29.136
Any who betray the throne
must be dealt with harshly.

40:29.302 --> 40:33.765
I mean, my throne, not my brother's,
who we're going to kill, right?

41:19.603 --> 41:21.646
Why, that's the signal from Jerry.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.566
It's go time, boys.

41:29.821 --> 41:33.742
Now, son of mine,
things might get scary in there.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.328
You stick close to your old pops.

41:36.495 --> 41:40.916
And if you need to defend yourself, use this.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.254
Hm. That works too.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.965
Open sesame.

41:51.134 --> 41:55.305
Ha-ha! Ride hard, men. We must get there
before the king's ship makes land.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.098
Won't my brother be surprised...

41:57.265 --> 42:00.435
...when he doesn't make it back
to England alive after all.

42:00.602 --> 42:05.273
I can't wait to see the look
on his cold, lifeless face.

42:08.944 --> 42:11.112
Close sesame.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.953
The castle sure seems empty.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.204
Yeah.

42:19.371 --> 42:23.124
Where were the sheriff and Prince John
riding off to so fast?

42:23.291 --> 42:24.960
Something's going on.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.128
We'll find out.

42:43.478 --> 42:46.147
- I'm here to minister to Maid Marion.
- Hm?

42:46.523 --> 42:48.149
I'm a friar, you know.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.157
Unh.Ha!

43:14.467 --> 43:15.760
Ouch.

43:16.177 --> 43:20.932
I have to get out of here.
I have to help save Robin. But how?

43:21.099 --> 43:23.643
Oh, this could work.

43:25.228 --> 43:27.606
Closed inside these walls

43:27.772 --> 43:30.275
I think of you

43:31.234 --> 43:37.032
Counting all the things that we could do

43:37.198 --> 43:40.035
Hugging, kissing, spooning

43:40.201 --> 43:43.079
But this crowd just makes me moan

43:43.246 --> 43:48.543
I wish it were the two of us alone

43:48.710 --> 43:53.715
Too many wolves I see
Too many mugs for me

43:53.882 --> 43:58.470
Too many chaps to tea
'Cause you are all I need

43:58.637 --> 44:01.556
Too many guys
Oh, gee, heh

44:01.723 --> 44:04.893
Too many boys for me to phone

44:05.060 --> 44:08.730
Wishing that we two could be alone

44:09.397 --> 44:15.236
Too many wolves for me
Takes too much energy

44:15.403 --> 44:19.866
Just do the math
And see that you are all I need

44:20.033 --> 44:23.119
I only want one man

44:23.286 --> 44:25.914
I'm not a girl you can co-own

44:26.081 --> 44:31.211
<i>- I'm glad that it's the two of us alone
- I'm glad that it's the two of us alone</i>

44:36.424 --> 44:38.051
Excuse me.

44:38.218 --> 44:40.053
I've come to rescue you.

44:40.220 --> 44:44.974
Well, thank you,
but I seem to have rescued myself.

45:01.324 --> 45:02.742
Shh.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.034
Aah--!

47:14.916 --> 47:17.836
Ah! Right on schedule. Heh.

47:25.134 --> 47:27.262
- Marion.
- Robin.

47:27.428 --> 47:30.098
- Oh, my darling.
- Oh, I was so worried.

47:30.265 --> 47:33.601
You know, I haven't had my kiss yet.

47:35.228 --> 47:36.437
- Mm...
- Woof.

47:36.604 --> 47:39.107
- Huh?
- Woof, woof, woof.

47:39.274 --> 47:44.737
Eh, we can't find nobody,
but we found this stuff in the prince's room.

47:53.371 --> 47:56.541
Don't look, son.
I'll explain it when you're older.

47:58.668 --> 48:00.795
Wait. This is it.

48:00.962 --> 48:05.800
Plans for the ambush of King Richard
as he comes ashore from France at dawn.

48:05.967 --> 48:07.302
We have to save him.

48:07.468 --> 48:09.971
But how will we get there in time?

48:10.388 --> 48:12.974
Hang on, my hearties!

48:13.266 --> 48:14.309
Whoa!

48:19.731 --> 48:21.232
It won't be long now, men.

48:28.907 --> 48:30.992
On my command.

48:45.757 --> 48:47.675
We're too late.

48:49.594 --> 48:50.678
It's worth a try.

48:51.054 --> 48:52.597
And...

48:59.354 --> 49:00.521
Fire!

49:08.655 --> 49:09.822
Oh!

49:11.199 --> 49:13.117
No.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.872
What in the name of heaven
is going on here?

49:18.039 --> 49:21.209
We're saving your life, sire.
It's a rescue.

49:22.377 --> 49:25.171
- Brace yourself!
- Oh...! Unh!

49:27.215 --> 49:29.884
You men, come with me.
The rest, stop them.

49:39.852 --> 49:41.229
Ha-ha!

49:41.396 --> 49:43.231
Ha-ha!

49:45.817 --> 49:47.193
Attack the king!

49:48.903 --> 49:51.364
I hope you're an adequate swordsman,
my boy.

49:51.531 --> 49:54.033
Oh, I dabble.

49:54.534 --> 49:55.576
Yam

49:59.247 --> 50:01.749
Take that. Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha.

50:03.376 --> 50:05.920
- There you go. Watch your step.
- Oh!

50:17.432 --> 50:18.599
Ha!

50:18.891 --> 50:19.934
Oh.

50:27.025 --> 50:30.403
It seems this is where your journey ends
Robin Hood.

50:30.570 --> 50:32.739
And where I become king...

50:32.905 --> 50:37.744
...upon my poor brother's
sudden and quite unexpected demise.

50:38.286 --> 50:41.748
You may strike us down,
but other heroes will rise up.

50:41.914 --> 50:44.250
Your days of tyranny are finished.

50:49.297 --> 50:50.965
Say, isn't that your cat?

50:53.051 --> 50:55.553
Not anymore. Aah!

51:10.735 --> 51:13.071
Stay still, you ungrateful wretch!

51:30.088 --> 51:32.590
Prepare to meet your maker,
Robin Hoo--!

51:35.051 --> 51:37.303
Unh! Aah!
Take that, mouseketeer!

51:39.847 --> 51:42.683
- Ha-ha! Where were we, brother?
- Grrrr.

51:43.684 --> 51:45.061
Yeow! Ha!

51:45.228 --> 51:47.021
En Qarde, pip-squeak.

51:47.188 --> 51:51.859
- Is that cat and that mouse with you?
- Yes, actually.

51:52.026 --> 51:55.196
I'm very glad they are.

51:55.822 --> 51:57.031
Me too, sire.

51:57.657 --> 52:01.452
You'll never beat me,
aah, you useless rodent. Hm.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.708
Ha-ha-ha! Yah!

52:09.043 --> 52:10.086
Ow!

52:13.464 --> 52:15.216
Ow! Ooh!

52:16.759 --> 52:18.553
Stop, stop! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

52:25.226 --> 52:28.396
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Stop, stop! Oh! Whoa!

52:28.563 --> 52:29.605
Stop! Aah!

52:31.524 --> 52:34.235
Oh, we don't have to bring mother
into this, do we?

52:34.402 --> 52:36.070
You're out-manned, cat.

52:36.237 --> 52:37.572
I'll take it from here.

52:37.738 --> 52:39.699
Hm? Aah!

52:53.296 --> 52:54.505
Die!

53:09.896 --> 53:13.065
I suppose you're wondering
about this, uh, assassination thing.

53:13.232 --> 53:15.610
Well, it's a funny story. Heh-heh.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.071
Come back here. Ha!

53:19.238 --> 53:20.698
Ready to cut your losses...

53:20.865 --> 53:24.410
- ...Sheriff of Nothingham?
- Huh? Mah! Aah!

53:24.869 --> 53:26.871
Oh! NO, no!

53:35.004 --> 53:37.882
This is all your fault,
Sheriff of Nothingham.

53:38.049 --> 53:39.050
- Idiot!
- Aah-ha-ha!

53:39.217 --> 53:40.801
Bravo, Jerry!

53:47.225 --> 53:51.270
You there, cat, mouse...

53:51.437 --> 53:52.480
...take a knee.

53:55.316 --> 54:01.614
For heroic service in the name
of justice, truth, honor and bravery...

54:02.156 --> 54:07.328
...I dub thee
Sir Tom Cat and Sir Jerry Mouse.

54:07.495 --> 54:09.163
Rise.

54:15.086 --> 54:17.546
So cheer our hero

54:17.713 --> 54:19.340
Who joins legends of old

54:19.507 --> 54:25.137
Raise a cup to Jerry
The mouse who's brave and bold

54:25.304 --> 54:28.599
That is why we sing of little Jerry Mouse

54:28.766 --> 54:32.603
Jerry saved our king
And beat that wretched louse

54:32.770 --> 54:36.190
He takes from the rich
And to the poor he gives

54:36.357 --> 54:39.694
And with us merry men
In Sherwood Forest lives

54:39.860 --> 54:41.487
And with us merry men

54:41.654 --> 54:45.950
- In Sherwood Forest lives
- Oh-hoo-hoo!

54:46.784 --> 54:48.869
I believe I owe you something.

54:49.036 --> 54:51.205
Ah, yes. Yes, you do.

54:51.372 --> 54:53.124
Heh. Mm.

54:53.291 --> 54:58.421
I just love a happy ending. Don't you?
