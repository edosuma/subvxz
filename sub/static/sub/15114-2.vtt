11:41.698 --> 11:42.665
But...

11:44.367 --> 11:45.935
at the end of the day...

11:49.406 --> 11:51.173
I think I'm here
'cause it was meant to be.

11:54.344 --> 11:57.113
A draft of your statement
to the press later tonight.

12:01.151 --> 12:03.419
I hate the Oxford comma,
incidentally.

12:03.454 --> 12:04.587
Pet peeve.

12:04.621 --> 12:06.155
I presume
you know what that is?

12:06.189 --> 12:07.556
Mental note.

12:07.590 --> 12:09.491
I'm indifferent myself,
but you won't see one again.

12:10.225 --> 12:13.195
Suddenly why do I find
myself missing Kitty?

12:13.229 --> 12:15.631
She's staying at her
parents' house in Winnetka--

12:16.165 --> 12:19.168
1117 Edgewood Lane.

12:19.202 --> 12:20.803
I thought you might want
to know that at some point.

12:20.837 --> 12:21.904
<i>And Emma?</i>

12:21.938 --> 12:24.307
I presume you know
where she is, too?

12:25.041 --> 12:26.042
Yes, sir.

12:26.076 --> 12:28.044
<i>Then why haven't</i> <i>you arranged
for her</i> <i>to be here,</i>

12:28.078 --> 12:29.612
on furlough
to the hospital,

12:29.647 --> 12:32.182
in case her mother doesn't
make it through the night?

12:33.651 --> 12:34.884
Right away.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.195
Comb through this
for Oxford commas, will you?

12:46.230 --> 12:47.831
What's an Oxford comma?

12:47.865 --> 12:49.933
Did you really
just ask me that?

12:49.967 --> 12:52.669
Fuck if I know.

12:52.703 --> 12:55.672
I just heard tomorrow's vote
on Lennox Gardens

12:55.706 --> 12:57.073
is still on the books.

12:58.576 --> 13:00.844
You mean that Kane might
actually be more concerned

13:00.878 --> 13:03.013
about his wife than
his next big power grab?

13:03.047 --> 13:05.649
Whatever the reason,
this is our chance.

13:05.683 --> 13:08.485
The Spirit does
move in mysterious ways.

13:08.519 --> 13:10.620
We will have to contend
with sympathy votes

13:10.655 --> 13:12.022
that may sway
in Kane's favor

13:12.056 --> 13:13.556
in the wake of tragedy.

13:13.591 --> 13:15.292
Then we'll just have to
sway them in our favor...

13:15.326 --> 13:16.593
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

13:16.627 --> 13:17.928
How so?

13:17.962 --> 13:21.965
See what funds there are upstairs
for a paint job in here.

13:23.534 --> 13:24.801
- <i>Sorry?</i>
- You heard me, girl.

13:25.836 --> 13:29.606
It's about time we breathed
some new life into this place.

13:33.811 --> 13:36.513
Rick: <i>I think we have</i>
<i>to be careful with this.</i>

13:36.547 --> 13:38.248
Kane explicitly forbade you

13:38.282 --> 13:39.949
from speaking to press
at the ceremony,

13:39.984 --> 13:41.851
and to lap up the attention

13:41.886 --> 13:44.187
that this photo will bring
might look to him,

13:44.221 --> 13:45.622
and perhaps
the public, too,

13:45.656 --> 13:48.024
like you're
exploiting tragedy.

13:48.058 --> 13:49.826
<i>( Cell phone rings )</i>

13:49.860 --> 13:52.027
- This is a gift from the gods, Rick.
- <i>(Cell phone rings)</i>

13:52.062 --> 13:54.596
We'd be crazy not to squeeze it
for all it's worth.

13:54.631 --> 13:56.331
Zajac: <i>This is what,</i>
<i>five hours ago?</i>

13:56.366 --> 13:57.766
I mean, I'm still
trying to make sense

13:57.801 --> 13:59.101
<i>of the fact</i>
<i>that it even happened.</i>

13:59.135 --> 14:00.335
Rick:
<i>Exactly.</i>

14:00.370 --> 14:02.304
You're not ready.
That's why we wait.

14:02.338 --> 14:03.638
Look,
the photo's gone viral.

14:03.673 --> 14:06.408
The buzz will do its own work
for the time being.

14:06.442 --> 14:08.677
<i>We play hard-to-get</i>
<i>with CNN and friends,</i>

14:08.711 --> 14:10.712
you come out looking
all the more honorable.

14:10.746 --> 14:12.147
<i>( Cell phone vibrating )</i>

14:12.182 --> 14:14.416
Maggie: <i>Those phones</i>
<i>are ringing now.</i>

14:14.450 --> 14:16.218
We wait, they stop,

14:16.252 --> 14:18.720
<i>and before we know it,</i>
<i>this is yesterday's news.</i>

14:18.755 --> 14:20.155
Now is the moment,

14:20.189 --> 14:22.057
<i>not after some polite passage</i>
<i>of time.</i>

14:22.091 --> 14:23.992
And by the way,
Kane hasn't given us

14:24.026 --> 14:25.860
the time of day
in nearly two weeks,

14:25.894 --> 14:27.795
except to essentially
put a gag in Ben's mouth

14:27.829 --> 14:29.063
at the O'Hare ceremony.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.499
Look, this thing's a winner,

14:32.534 --> 14:35.602
there's no doubt about that,
but I don't know.

14:35.636 --> 14:37.270
You're both right.

14:37.305 --> 14:39.272
It could look exploitative
on one hand,

14:39.306 --> 14:41.074
and it's now or never
on the other.

14:42.108 --> 14:44.344
The public will eat this
up, as they should.

14:44.378 --> 14:45.912
<i>On the Kane front,</i>

14:45.946 --> 14:47.713
<i>we cover ourselves</i> <i>with a
visit</i> <i>to the hospital.</i>

14:47.748 --> 14:50.382
Good intentions preempt any
apparent designs on publicity.

14:50.417 --> 14:53.653
Not that we don't milk the press
gauntlet as long as we're there.

14:53.687 --> 14:55.655
I don't know.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.424
Ben?

15:01.929 --> 15:03.463
It's late, Rick.

15:03.497 --> 15:06.399
<i>Why don't we sleep on it</i>
<i>and get back to you tomorrow.</i>

15:22.817 --> 15:24.184
<i>( Door closes )</i>

15:27.722 --> 15:28.922

15:44.139 --> 15:46.708

These--

16:28.848 --> 16:30.482
It's all right.

16:30.516 --> 16:32.317
I'm here.

16:32.352 --> 16:34.653
Everything's going to be fine.

18:04.546 --> 18:08.749
Should she
be given last rites...

18:08.783 --> 18:10.284
if necessary?

18:10.318 --> 18:14.454
She never expressed her own
wishes one way or another?

18:17.658 --> 18:19.960
A rare omission

18:19.994 --> 18:23.598
for a woman who always
made her wishes known.

18:23.632 --> 18:29.136
She was more of a "my will" than
a "Thy will" kind of person.

18:29.171 --> 18:33.074
Is more of one, rather.

18:33.108 --> 18:35.176
I don't know,

18:35.211 --> 18:37.145
maybe it doesn't make
a difference either way.

18:39.582 --> 18:41.983
God will not be mocked.

18:42.017 --> 18:45.786
Nor will He be denied
a child who returns to Him,

18:45.821 --> 18:48.122
however late in the game.

18:51.426 --> 18:53.193
How about I say a prayer?

18:55.163 --> 18:56.663
Sure.

19:07.007 --> 19:09.442
Do you need
anything else beforehand?

19:09.477 --> 19:10.743
Yeah.

19:11.278 --> 19:14.413
For all of this
to just be a bad dream.

19:18.586 --> 19:19.586
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

19:19.620 --> 19:21.020
Man:
<i>Mr. Mayor, here!</i>

19:21.055 --> 19:23.056
Second man: <i>Just a couple</i>
<i>of questions, please, sir.</i>

19:28.162 --> 19:30.096
I'm afraid there's
little I can say...

19:31.532 --> 19:35.068
that you don't already know
about this tragic event,

19:35.102 --> 19:38.871
not only in my life,
but in the life of Chicago.

19:40.974 --> 19:43.142
An occasion
for celebration was...

19:44.578 --> 19:46.112
turned into one of terror

19:46.146 --> 19:48.981
when a bullet
clearly intended for me

19:49.016 --> 19:50.550
hit my wife instead.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.854
Meredith...

20:02.330 --> 20:04.898
She was there at my side,
as she has always been,

20:04.932 --> 20:10.070
and for that, she has paid
a terrible, unimaginable price.

20:12.206 --> 20:15.609
Suffice it to say, I couldn't
have done this job without her.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.549
Hopefully, I...
I won't have to.

20:41.802 --> 20:44.804
I can't remember...

20:44.839 --> 20:47.574
the last time
I had to do this. Uh...

20:50.744 --> 20:51.878
Forgive me.

20:54.314 --> 20:56.249
Too many thank yous
are in order,

20:56.284 --> 20:59.987
from the paramedics and surgeons
now operating on Meredith,

21:00.021 --> 21:05.359
to anyone and everyone hoping
or praying on her behalf.

21:05.393 --> 21:07.561
So let me say
to one and all, thank you,

21:07.596 --> 21:11.699
and let me assure you that
the shooter will be found...

21:12.801 --> 21:14.435
and will be punished.

21:16.272 --> 21:17.906
Good night.

21:23.446 --> 21:25.547
<i>Now, as for the target,</i>
<i>we have every reason to believe</i>

Please, forgive
the disturbance.

22:31.813 --> 22:33.647
Good night.

23:22.298 --> 23:24.433
Excuse me. I wanted to leave
a note for Mayor Kane.

23:24.467 --> 23:25.634
You are?

23:25.668 --> 23:27.069
Kitty O'Neil.
I used to work for him.

23:27.103 --> 23:28.971
I'm not asking to see him.

23:29.005 --> 23:30.339
I just want

23:41.884 --> 23:44.286
I'm sorry.
I'm either blanking,

23:44.320 --> 23:45.787
or I've
never heard of you.

23:47.724 --> 23:49.558
I'd be happy to give
the Mayor your message,

23:49.593 --> 23:51.493
but unscheduled visitors
really aren't allowed

23:51.528 --> 23:53.095

23:53.129 --> 23:54.830
Just let him know
I stopped by.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.675
Sir, I just
wanted to say that..

24:25.229 --> 24:26.396
No, no, I'm not going.
I'm not going.

24:26.430 --> 24:27.563
Well, you can tell
the Warden that.

24:27.598 --> 24:29.499
Well, fuck the Warden
and fuck you. Ow!

24:29.533 --> 24:30.733
Ow!
You're hurting me.

24:30.768 --> 24:33.469
Oh yeah? How about now?

24:33.504 --> 24:35.372
I don't care if you're
the Mayor's daughter.

I don't care if your
mom is at death's door

24:37.241 --> 24:38.542
or you don't
want to see her.

24:38.576 --> 24:41.311

26:04.162 --> 26:05.763
<i>( Door opens )</i>

26:10.702 --> 26:14.872
The ballistic trauma caused a severe
pulmonary laceration in her right lung,

26:14.907 --> 26:18.276
as well as ruptures to a major
blood vessel in the thorax.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.112
After several attempts
to drain fluid

26:21.146 --> 26:23.080
and repair
the collapsed right lung,

26:23.114 --> 26:27.117
she underwent a partial pneumonectomy
in which half of it was removed.

26:27.151 --> 26:28.818
But you're telling me
she's alive.

26:28.852 --> 26:30.519
Indeed.

26:30.553 --> 26:32.522
Just that we're keeping
a close eye on her,

26:32.556 --> 26:34.890
as complications
can arise at any moment.

26:34.925 --> 26:39.127
Is it possible to live a normal
life with half a lung missing?

26:39.162 --> 26:41.096
For the most part, yes.

26:41.130 --> 26:43.932
Significant physical therapy will
be required in the short term,

26:43.966 --> 26:47.936
and she probably won't be climbing
any mountains in the long term.

26:47.971 --> 26:50.272
She prefers
the metaphorical kind anyway.

26:50.306 --> 26:51.640
Hmm.

26:53.711 --> 26:55.778
Thank you, doctor.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.281
When can I see her?

26:58.315 --> 26:59.315
Not for several hours,

26:59.350 --> 27:01.550
given the anesthesia
and surgical impact.

27:01.585 --> 27:03.686

the time for a shower

ago from Arizona to talk,

27:50.467 --> 27:53.803
only to fall off the map
again the very next day,

28:03.214 --> 28:04.381
repeatedly.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.786
Sabbatical or exile,
Dr. Harris?

28:08.820 --> 28:10.721
And what suddenly
brought it to an end?

28:10.756 --> 28:12.257
You'd like
to know why I called?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.192
Why I ever saw Kane
in the first place?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.694
I most certainly do.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.130
As would his nearly
3 million constituents.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.966
I am treating someone else
the Mayor cares about deeply.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.434
That's all
I'm prepared to say.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.569
That's funny,
because Mrs. Kane told me

28:24.603 --> 28:27.005
that you were treating
her husband for migraines.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.740
Then maybe you should
go to intensive care

28:28.774 --> 28:30.842
and call bullshit
on her, too.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.577
I hear she's out of surgery.

28:43.989 --> 28:46.857
<i>( Whispering voices )</i>

28:49.160 --> 28:50.928
I was just telling them that
you weren't seeing anyone.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.796
It's okay.

28:53.830 --> 28:56.233
Long as we're not talking
about the campaign.

28:57.635 --> 28:58.835
No, sir.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.671
Good news about Meredith.

29:01.706 --> 29:04.708
Vigilance continues,
but, yes, it is.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.845
Listen we don't want
to take up any of your time,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.047
but we just
couldn't stay away.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.249
If there's anything you need,
anything at all,

29:11.283 --> 29:12.517
we'll let you know.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.689
I mean, uh, we just wanted
to let you know...

29:24.063 --> 29:25.697
Anything.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.432
Anytime.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.903
Okay. We'll leave you be.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.305
Yeah. Thanks for coming.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.510
That was Babe McGantry
calling again.

29:38.544 --> 29:39.811
Next.

29:39.846 --> 29:42.481
Spoke with the warden's
office at Cook County Jail.

29:42.515 --> 29:44.383
Emma
resisted the furlough.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.652
The Warden said sedation was
an option if you insisted.

29:46.686 --> 29:49.021
No. Call the car.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.155
Where to?

29:50.190 --> 29:51.257
<i>Home.</i>

29:51.291 --> 29:52.458
Got to get
a change of clothes.

29:52.492 --> 29:53.458
I can do that
if you'd like.

29:53.493 --> 29:56.362
Listen to me
the first time.

29:58.565 --> 30:00.199
<i>( Elevator bell dings )</i>

30:04.105 --> 30:06.640
The Lennox Gardens vote
is on,

30:06.674 --> 30:09.143
<i>I wanted to make sure</i> <i>you still
count</i> <i>for a solid "no."</i>

30:09.177 --> 30:10.578
It ain't the greatest day

30:10.612 --> 30:13.014
to take a stand against
the Mayor, you know?

30:13.048 --> 30:14.882
He can have
our sympathy, Reginald.

30:14.917 --> 30:17.018
But he cannot
have unchecked power

30:17.052 --> 30:18.887
against the Chicago
Housing Authority.

30:18.921 --> 30:20.489
I hear you talking,
believe me.

30:20.523 --> 30:22.491
That's why I was
no the other day.

30:22.525 --> 30:26.262
But, man, something heartless
this time around.

30:26.296 --> 30:28.264
In you or in him?

30:29.298 --> 30:31.568
<i>Time is money, Reginald,</i>

30:31.602 --> 30:32.869
<i>and knowing you have</i>

30:32.904 --> 30:35.272
less of the latter
than meets the eye,

30:35.307 --> 30:39.344
would a promissory note toward
your re-election campaign

30:39.378 --> 30:40.979
<i>help our cause here?</i>

30:41.013 --> 30:42.747
25,000?

31:09.042 --> 31:10.642
( Sighs )

31:38.102 --> 31:40.337
<i>( TV turns on )</i>

31:40.371 --> 31:44.273
Female reporter: <i>Mrs. Zajac, would
you</i> <i>say it's an exaggeration</i>

31:44.308 --> 31:45.374
<i>that your husband</i>
<i>responded like a hero</i>

31:45.409 --> 31:46.910
<i>at the scene</i>
<i>of the shooting?</i>

31:46.944 --> 31:50.414
Maggie: <i>Uh, Ben responded</i>
<i>the only way he knows how.</i>

31:50.448 --> 31:52.382
<i>If that makes him a hero,</i>

31:52.417 --> 31:54.084
<i>I wouldn't know</i>
<i>the difference.</i>

31:54.118 --> 31:57.821
Ben: <i>Listen,</i> <i>today we are
the hero,</i> <i>all of Chicago.</i>

31:57.856 --> 31:59.590
<i>Despite such a dark hour,</i>

31:59.624 --> 32:02.826
<i>I am confident</i> <i>that we will all
forge</i> <i>on together as one.</i>

32:23.982 --> 32:24.982
<i>( Gunshot )</i>

33:14.200 --> 33:16.568
Mona: <i>$25,000?</i>

33:16.602 --> 33:19.504
Last I checked, your PAC didn't
have even half of that in it

33:19.538 --> 33:22.440
for your own re-election,
let alone someone else's.

33:22.474 --> 33:23.874
You're telling me
you're not aware

33:23.909 --> 33:25.410
of other sources
of revenue

33:25.444 --> 33:26.878
<i>after how long you've</i>
<i>been working for me?</i>

33:26.912 --> 33:28.546
<i>Interesting time</i>

33:28.580 --> 33:31.482
to break the "Don't ask, don't
tell" policy around here.

33:31.516 --> 33:34.152
What's our Plan B if the vote
doesn't go our way?

33:34.186 --> 33:36.888
<i>It's going our way!</i>

33:37.923 --> 33:41.259
If I have to buy a vote
or two to make it so,

33:41.294 --> 33:43.428
then welcome to Chicago.

33:43.963 --> 33:46.064
<i>But over my dead body</i>

33:46.599 --> 33:48.433
will the Gardens
be torn down

33:48.468 --> 33:51.203
by this cracker-ass
fascist in suspenders

33:51.237 --> 33:53.939
after all the shit he's
pulled right under our eyes.

33:53.973 --> 33:55.674
Better yet, over
his wife's dead body,

33:55.708 --> 33:57.509
if only she hadn't made it
through the night.

33:57.543 --> 34:00.111
<i>What in God's name</i>
<i>happened to you?</i>

34:02.214 --> 34:05.383
Did Kane have anything to do
with you checking out?

34:08.353 --> 34:09.654
Stand up.

34:09.688 --> 34:11.121
Excuse me?

34:13.125 --> 34:15.460
Stand up. Now.

34:35.214 --> 34:39.717
You're not standing here
but for my generosity,

34:40.251 --> 34:44.188
when I threw you a bone
and showed you the ropes.

34:44.973 --> 34:47.391
I don't recall
it being so cliché.

34:47.426 --> 34:50.762
What, you got a taste
of power the other day,

34:50.795 --> 34:54.632
voting proxy in my place?

34:55.666 --> 34:57.835
Don't let it
go to your head.

35:13.651 --> 35:14.751
<i>( Door closes )</i>

35:37.276 --> 35:39.677
I'm afraid this is
the way it's going to be.

35:41.947 --> 35:44.982
As much as you can't fill
the hole you've created.

35:49.254 --> 35:50.488
Mr. Mayor.

35:51.790 --> 35:53.190
Right.

35:53.225 --> 35:54.825
<i>Security</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

35:54.859 --> 35:55.859
Do you want me
to turn the air on?

35:55.894 --> 35:57.628
I'm fine.

35:57.662 --> 35:59.897
That shooter might
have missed you, boss...

36:02.334 --> 36:03.668
and so do I.

36:08.306 --> 36:11.308
Ross: <i>Today we vote</i>
<i>for the future of Chicago.</i>

36:11.343 --> 36:15.212
Yes, Lennox Gardens
is my house,

36:15.247 --> 36:17.715
so I do have
a vested interest.

36:17.749 --> 36:20.250
But the Chicago Housing
Authority

36:20.285 --> 36:22.752
is in all our purview,

36:22.787 --> 36:24.354
not the Mayor's alone,

36:24.388 --> 36:28.824
and in this, we should
all have a vested interest.

36:28.859 --> 36:31.561
<i>Some might accuse me</i>
<i>of playing the race card.</i>

36:31.595 --> 36:32.928
So be it.

36:32.963 --> 36:35.831
<i>Better that than to fold</i>
<i>at a table like this,</i>

36:36.266 --> 36:39.634
stacked as it is
in one man's favor.

36:40.970 --> 36:44.239
<i>I know this is a hard day</i>
<i>to take a stand</i>

36:46.273 --> 36:50.979
against a man who's been
through something so horrific.

36:53.182 --> 36:55.984
<i>Let it be a stand against</i>
<i>the principle instead</i>

36:56.019 --> 37:00.089
<i>of unprecedented autocracy</i>
<i>in the public sphere.</i>

37:00.123 --> 37:02.825
Mayor Kane
can have our sympathy,

37:02.860 --> 37:04.794
and he certainly does.

37:04.828 --> 37:07.631
But he cannot have
such unchecked power

37:07.665 --> 37:09.199
as he alone sees fit.

37:09.233 --> 37:11.201
Woman:
<i>Is that the Mayor?</i>

37:11.235 --> 37:13.036
( Chamber reacting )

37:25.683 --> 37:27.817
Thought
I taught you a lesson.

37:32.223 --> 37:34.724
You have no idea
how good it is to see you.

37:36.493 --> 37:41.496
I appreciate the sympathy
expressed by Alderman Ross.

37:41.531 --> 37:43.565
And I understand the concern.

37:43.599 --> 37:45.267
But I beg to differ

37:45.301 --> 37:48.970
<i>on the principle</i>
<i>in question here today.</i>

37:49.004 --> 37:52.506
<i>You know, if the last 24 hours</i>
<i>has taught me anything,</i>

37:52.541 --> 37:54.275
it's never too late
for change...

37:56.578 --> 37:58.779
until it's too late.

38:00.849 --> 38:03.684
<i>That is the principle</i>
<i>in question today--</i>

38:03.718 --> 38:05.519
change.

38:05.553 --> 38:08.422
Whether we have
the wherewithal to make it.

38:08.456 --> 38:13.393
For on my watch, as a young
mayor at Lennox Gardens...

38:15.096 --> 38:16.630
mistakes were made.

38:16.664 --> 38:20.267
Administrative blunders,
bureaucratic mishaps,

38:20.301 --> 38:24.037
<i>and the city has paid</i>
<i>a price ever since.</i>

38:26.507 --> 38:29.709
Now, I may have had more hair
and less girth back then...

38:31.646 --> 38:33.446
<i>and I had</i>
<i>neither the foresight</i>

38:33.481 --> 38:37.417
nor the fortitude
to know what I know now.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.589
Nothing is irreversible.

38:42.623 --> 38:46.693
Nothing is irreparable,

38:47.228 --> 38:51.732
<i>except a willing capitulation</i>

38:51.766 --> 38:53.433
to the status quo.

38:53.468 --> 38:56.703
<i>I, too, have a vested interest</i>
<i>in Lennox Gardens,</i>

38:56.737 --> 39:00.173
because life offers
nothing so precious...

39:01.743 --> 39:04.645
as a second chance.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.581
<i>If anyone would care</i>
<i>to take a stand</i>

39:06.615 --> 39:10.385
<i>against the principle</i>
<i>of that,</i>

39:10.419 --> 39:12.120
please, be my guest.

39:20.230 --> 39:21.531
Then...

39:22.533 --> 39:23.833
motion to vote.

39:23.867 --> 39:25.868
( Applause )

39:29.073 --> 39:31.074
Hear, hear.

39:34.845 --> 39:36.312
Hear, hear.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.661
Good job.

40:02.372 --> 40:03.706
Well done.

40:03.741 --> 40:05.875
You spent so much time
playing by the book,

40:05.910 --> 40:07.944
you didn't even think
to put a tail on him.

40:21.059 --> 40:23.226
There's a community there,

40:23.261 --> 40:27.697
not just a record of administrative
blunders and bureaucratic mishaps.

40:27.732 --> 40:29.232
That's all been taken
into account.

40:29.767 --> 40:33.069
Not if their only options are
relocation to the outskirts

40:33.103 --> 40:37.407
or high-end condos they can't
afford in the new development.

40:37.441 --> 40:39.275
You want
to fix past mistakes?

40:39.360 --> 40:41.828
Give those who need it most
something to come back to,

40:41.862 --> 40:44.063
something affordable
and safe.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.632
I almost hear
an "or else" in there.

40:46.666 --> 40:50.536
Or else they take
the problems with them.

40:51.070 --> 40:53.405
<i>For all the horror</i>
<i>of the past 24 hours,</i>

40:53.440 --> 40:56.175
that's commonplace
at Lennox Gardens.

40:56.209 --> 40:59.278
It won't go away with
an architectural facelift.

40:59.312 --> 41:03.115
Did you just use my wife
for political purposes?

41:03.149 --> 41:05.284
Didn't you just do the same?

41:08.321 --> 41:10.856
If you want to make sure this
project turns out right,

41:10.891 --> 41:15.961
perhaps you should come work for
me to ensure a better outcome.

41:15.996 --> 41:17.229
What?

41:17.264 --> 41:20.132
I need to fill the vacancy
left by Ezra Stone,

41:20.166 --> 41:25.572
and you need to part ways
with Alderman Ross.

41:25.606 --> 41:27.307
No?

41:27.342 --> 41:28.642
Admit it.

41:28.677 --> 41:31.746
The only thing he wants to
keep intact at Lennox Gardens

41:31.780 --> 41:34.783
is the dirty pipeline
of money and votes.

41:34.817 --> 41:37.986
You stay where you are,
imagining change,

41:38.021 --> 41:41.590
or decamp
and make it happen.

41:42.125 --> 41:45.060
How do I know this isn't you
taking home a trophy

41:45.095 --> 41:47.663
on top of winning the vote?

41:47.698 --> 41:49.866
Only one way to find out.

41:49.900 --> 41:52.636
The offer expires as soon
as I walk out the door.

41:55.807 --> 41:58.508
- Always a pleasure.
- Congratulations.

42:02.580 --> 42:03.981
I'm in.

42:25.002 --> 42:27.036
Miller:
So we meet again.

42:27.071 --> 42:28.705
We do.

42:28.739 --> 42:32.709
I thought I was as good as dead
to you at the cemetery.

42:32.743 --> 42:35.078
That's a bad joke.
I'm glad you called.

42:35.112 --> 42:36.646
Waiter: <i>Could I start you
off</i> <i>with a cocktail?</i>

42:37.681 --> 42:39.316
Uh, cabernet, please.

42:39.350 --> 42:41.518
Actually,
Diet Coke's fine.

42:41.552 --> 42:43.420
I drove, so...

42:43.454 --> 42:45.121
Now you're
making me look bad.

42:46.290 --> 42:49.825
I'll have a, um,
Jameson's on the rocks.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.527
Thank you.

42:54.998 --> 42:56.165
So?

42:56.199 --> 42:57.733
So?

42:57.768 --> 42:59.735
We can talk
off the record, I hope?

42:59.770 --> 43:00.869
Yeah, by all means.

43:00.904 --> 43:02.271
The shooting.

43:02.305 --> 43:04.272
You know anything that
isn't on the front page?

43:04.307 --> 43:06.708
You could try asking the lead
detective or State's Attorney,

43:06.743 --> 43:09.444
<i>but they'll barely give me</i>
<i>the time of the day, so...</i>

43:09.478 --> 43:12.781
Well, that's 'cause Galvez
is completely useless,

43:12.815 --> 43:15.750
and Doyle
cannot be trusted.

43:15.785 --> 43:17.085
My turn?

43:17.120 --> 43:19.321
Yes.

43:19.355 --> 43:20.722
What the hell
happened with you?

43:20.756 --> 43:21.855
( Laughs )

43:21.856 --> 43:23.358
Wow, subtle.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.260
Mayor Kane's
left-hand woman,

43:25.294 --> 43:26.561
one of the sharper minds
in town,

43:26.595 --> 43:29.097
<i>I'm not going to waste</i>
<i>your time being coy.</i>

43:29.132 --> 43:30.499
Look, you don't
get fired or quit

43:30.533 --> 43:31.900
unless some major shit
goes down.

43:31.935 --> 43:33.235
I can't talk about it.

43:33.770 --> 43:35.872
For now.

43:40.511 --> 43:43.913
Do you know anything about Kane
seeing a Dr. Ella Harris?

43:43.947 --> 43:45.314
What do you mean,
romantically?

43:45.349 --> 43:47.083
Neurologically.

43:47.117 --> 43:48.351
I don't understand.

43:48.385 --> 43:50.786
What are you--
Are you saying he's sick?

43:50.821 --> 43:54.290
Or has migraines
or a sick loved one.

43:54.324 --> 43:55.791
Depends on who you ask.

43:55.825 --> 43:56.959
Wait a minute.
Back up a second.

43:56.993 --> 43:59.127
You're telling me
that you know for a fact

43:59.161 --> 44:01.496
that Kane has been seeing
a neurologist?

44:01.530 --> 44:03.965
Maybe.
I can't tell you.

44:05.568 --> 44:08.804
Yes, he has,
but that's all I know.

44:12.475 --> 44:13.776
What about you?

44:13.810 --> 44:14.910
What about me?

44:14.945 --> 44:16.211
What's next?

44:16.246 --> 44:18.847
New job?
Gonna take a vacation?

44:18.882 --> 44:21.150
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

44:21.184 --> 44:23.319
You can't just let me
leave here empty-handed.

44:23.353 --> 44:24.654
Says the pot calling
the kettle black.

44:24.689 --> 44:26.022
Let's make a deal then.

44:26.057 --> 44:27.023
- A deal.
- A deal.

44:27.058 --> 44:28.158
Okay.

44:28.192 --> 44:29.726
You answer
one tough question

44:29.760 --> 44:32.428
professional, personal, my
choice, and I'll do the same.

44:32.463 --> 44:33.429
Deal?

44:33.464 --> 44:34.831
Professional.
My choice.

44:34.865 --> 44:35.865
Fine.

44:37.168 --> 44:38.335
Thanks.

44:41.138 --> 44:42.638
<i>Mmm...</i>

44:44.842 --> 44:46.275
Zajac.

44:46.310 --> 44:47.877
What gives?

44:47.911 --> 44:49.479
Did you get to know him
before the primaries?

44:49.513 --> 44:51.848
Is he really the shell
he seems to be,

44:51.882 --> 44:53.883
or is there something there
actually worth voting for?

44:54.918 --> 44:56.319
I don't know.

45:00.925 --> 45:02.225
Excuse me a second.

45:06.030 --> 45:07.231
Okay.

45:15.607 --> 45:16.908
Tom.

45:19.478 --> 45:21.646
Hello, Babe.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.747
What a relief.

45:22.781 --> 45:24.182
She's coming along.

45:24.216 --> 45:26.751
She always was a fighter.

45:26.785 --> 45:28.152
I tried calling,

45:28.186 --> 45:30.087
but maybe your new kid
didn't get you the message.

45:30.122 --> 45:35.660
I figured it was more about
Lennox Gardens than Meredith.

45:35.694 --> 45:37.595
Well, let's just say
it was about both,

45:37.629 --> 45:39.363
considering how much
it means to her

45:39.398 --> 45:41.732
that we carry on
in her spirit.

45:43.768 --> 45:46.470
You made the right move
at City Hall,

45:46.504 --> 45:48.705
at the right time.

45:48.739 --> 45:51.007
I guess we'll be seeing
more of each other,

45:51.041 --> 45:54.110
at least until Meredith
is back on her feet.

45:57.314 --> 45:59.248
I guess we will.

46:02.352 --> 46:03.352
Wait.

46:07.324 --> 46:15.465
Who let him in
to see my wife before I do?

46:15.499 --> 46:17.434
It wasn't my shift.
It...

46:17.468 --> 46:19.069
<i>Nobody--</i>

46:19.103 --> 46:22.439
Nobody gets near this room
again without my permission.

46:22.473 --> 46:26.643
Your shift or not,
it will be your last.

46:26.677 --> 46:27.977
Yes?

46:28.012 --> 46:30.380
Yes.

46:48.799 --> 46:50.900
I don't bite.

46:50.935 --> 46:54.505
What, now he sends lackeys from
the mailroom to do his bidding?

46:54.539 --> 46:55.673
Not exactly.

46:55.707 --> 46:57.441
I'm filling in
as his aide,

46:57.475 --> 46:58.976
for good
if I can help it,

46:59.010 --> 47:01.812
<i>so you might need</i>
<i>to get used to me.</i>

47:01.847 --> 47:03.748
And I'm not here to get you
to go to the hospital.

47:03.782 --> 47:05.583
I'm not going
to the hospital.

47:05.617 --> 47:07.618
I know, yeah.

47:08.620 --> 47:12.756
I'd miss it here, too,
even for an hour.

47:14.025 --> 47:16.560
Do you know how many facial
muscles it takes to frown?

47:17.094 --> 47:18.695
<i>Something like 47.</i>

47:18.729 --> 47:20.029
Fascinating.

47:20.564 --> 47:22.131
And only two to smile,

47:22.166 --> 47:23.633
so why don't you
just admit

47:23.667 --> 47:26.102
that I'm the best-looking guy
you've seen in two weeks?

47:26.136 --> 47:28.304
Which understandably
isn't saying much.

47:30.474 --> 47:32.575
You work for my father?

47:36.246 --> 47:38.213
I work for the Mayor.

47:38.248 --> 47:39.915
<i>And as long</i> <i>as you keep
up</i> <i>this kind of routine,</i>

47:39.950 --> 47:41.317
<i>you might as well</i>
<i>work for your father.</i>

47:41.351 --> 47:42.384
How so?

47:42.419 --> 47:44.153
Nothing empowers him more

47:44.187 --> 47:46.790
than having big problems
and solving them.

47:46.824 --> 47:49.726
Right now, you are
one of the biggest.

47:49.760 --> 47:52.362
He threw me under a bus
to save his career.

47:52.397 --> 47:53.631
<i>Exactly.</i>

47:54.165 --> 47:57.168
Which has left him
with a very big problem,

47:57.202 --> 47:58.470
as far as I can see it.

47:59.872 --> 48:01.139
How to win you back.

48:03.643 --> 48:04.609
Good luck.

48:04.644 --> 48:06.378
Look, don't get me wrong.

48:06.412 --> 48:09.214
I'm not suggesting
you should let him.

48:09.249 --> 48:11.584
I'm not even suggesting
you should forgive him.

48:13.119 --> 48:15.888
God knows I can
relate in my own life.

48:15.922 --> 48:17.423
What I'm saying is,

48:17.457 --> 48:19.024
if you want
to get back at him

48:19.059 --> 48:21.293
or make him pay
in any way--

48:21.328 --> 48:22.728
psychologically,
mind you.

48:22.763 --> 48:24.296
I am not suggesting
something worse.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.134
You can't do it from the
bottom of a glue tube

48:28.168 --> 48:29.535
in county jail.

48:31.005 --> 48:34.141
In other words,
tell him how I really feel

48:34.175 --> 48:36.276
when you get me
to go to the hospital.

48:36.311 --> 48:38.212
Truth be told...

48:41.283 --> 48:43.585
I have a longer game
in mind than that.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.321
House arrest.

48:46.355 --> 48:48.055
What? Where?

48:49.591 --> 48:52.025
No, No.
I'm not going home.

48:52.060 --> 48:55.329
<i>Yeah. You'd rather stick it out</i>
<i>in this hellhole instead.</i>

48:55.364 --> 48:57.064
That brick house
who protects you,

48:57.098 --> 48:59.299
<i>according to the guards,</i>
<i>she's up for parole.</i>

48:59.333 --> 49:00.800
<i>She gets out, then what?</i>

49:00.835 --> 49:04.036
You hurt your dad by getting
yourself hurt or worse?

49:07.140 --> 49:08.274
( Respirator hissing,
monitor beeping )

49:30.997 --> 49:32.498
You should be proud.

49:34.300 --> 49:37.002
( Alarms beeping )

49:38.204 --> 49:40.638
- What's happening?
- Slr, please step out the room.

49:40.639 --> 49:42.238
 What's happening?

49:42.942 --> 49:43.976
Tom:
<i>Is she all right?</i>

49:44.010 --> 49:45.010
Sir, please
step out of the room.

49:45.045 --> 49:47.346
<i>Is she all right?</i>

49:47.381 --> 49:49.315
Somebody *** ****
get the *** to the O.R.

49:53.187 --> 49:54.387
<i>Somebody--</i>

49:54.422 --> 49:56.356
Somebody get the priest.

50:19.380 --> 50:21.081
Don't fool yourself.

50:22.083 --> 50:23.583
Sir?

50:26.387 --> 50:28.889
You sure you don't
want to wait downstairs?

50:28.923 --> 50:30.958
Just needed
to get some air.

50:30.992 --> 50:31.959
Stay.

50:31.993 --> 50:33.761
Run for your life, kid.

50:37.967 --> 50:42.204
Many kinds of business I've
come to handle over the years.

50:42.238 --> 50:44.272
Death and dying
isn't one of them.

50:45.875 --> 50:47.242
You're not alone.

50:47.276 --> 50:48.777
Oh, yes, he is.

50:48.811 --> 50:50.112
Aren't you, boss?

50:51.548 --> 50:53.982
I do have what might be
some good news, though.

50:55.451 --> 50:57.819
I spoke with the warden
and parole board

50:57.854 --> 51:00.723
about the possibility
of house arrest for Emma.

51:01.457 --> 51:02.992
They seem willing
to consider it

51:03.026 --> 51:05.428
in light
of family circumstance.

51:05.462 --> 51:07.697
I can only imagine what Emma
would have to say.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.866
The truth is,
she wouldn't have a choice.

51:10.868 --> 51:12.803
But I spoke with her, too.

51:14.606 --> 51:15.572
You did?

51:15.607 --> 51:16.807
Just to play the good cop.

51:16.841 --> 51:17.842
You being--

51:17.876 --> 51:18.910
Me being the bad cop.

51:18.944 --> 51:20.378
That's not what I meant.

51:22.915 --> 51:26.418
I've hired Mona Fredricks
to replace Ezra Stone.

51:28.087 --> 51:30.155
I'd like you
to stay on as well.

51:34.227 --> 51:36.428
You would?

51:36.463 --> 51:40.266
Past whatever temporary arrangement
you've made with Alderman Driscoll.

51:47.441 --> 51:49.175
I'll take care of it.

51:51.412 --> 51:53.146
I'm sure you will.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.933
We shored up residual perforations
in the superior lobe,

52:15.967 --> 52:17.734
<i>so I wouldn't expect</i>
<i>a relapse.</i>

52:17.769 --> 52:19.202
In a few days,
when breathing has normalized,

52:19.237 --> 52:20.237
she'll be extubated.

52:21.939 --> 52:23.039
( Coughs )

52:23.074 --> 52:24.641
Surgeon:
<i>Her throat will be sore</i>

52:24.675 --> 52:26.810
<i>and it will take some time</i>
<i>for her voice to recover,</i>

52:26.845 --> 52:28.178
<i>starting with whispers.</i>

52:28.213 --> 52:29.313
Here.

52:34.017 --> 52:35.252
I'll slip you some iced tea

52:35.286 --> 52:37.054
when the nurse is looking
the other way.

52:39.890 --> 52:42.225
( Trying to speak )

52:43.259 --> 52:44.594
Don't force it.

52:44.629 --> 52:45.662
You got plenty of time.

52:47.365 --> 52:48.332
Di--

52:52.003 --> 52:53.804
What?

52:55.608 --> 52:56.774
Did...

52:58.444 --> 53:00.512
<i>( Gasping )</i>

53:00.546 --> 53:01.913
Did...

53:04.417 --> 53:06.718
Did you...

53:08.054 --> 53:10.222
do this to me?

53:13.826 --> 53:15.627
Meredith.

53:18.998 --> 53:20.031
No.

53:21.367 --> 53:23.268
( Crying )

53:26.673 --> 53:28.708
No.
