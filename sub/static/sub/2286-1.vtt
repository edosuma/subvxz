00:45.080 --> 00:47.560
Hey, hey. If you're coming in
for the morning grind...

00:47.720 --> 00:50.405
...it's another brutal Monday out there
traffic-wise.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.326
The <i>2</i> is slow-and-go to the 5.
A Sig Alert is bogging down the l-10.

00:54.480 --> 00:58.405
And if you're on the 405 freeway,
you're probably already late for work.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.326
If your boss gives you a hard time about it,
have him come down here and talk to...

01:02.480 --> 01:03.527
- ...Rachel.
- Oh, no.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.406
Zing! Ha, ha. Thanks, Skip.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.086
But, hey, speaking of bosses,
after the break...

01:10.240 --> 01:14.962
...we get to meet three guys who are chasing
their dream of becoming their own bosses.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.167
Stay with us.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.642
And we're out. Very good, guys.
We're back in 90 seconds.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.521
Jesus Christ.
Dale, you gotta stop sweating, pal.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.763
- Oh, wow, you are wet.
- "Stop sweating." How do I stop sweating?

01:28.920 --> 01:31.491
This is a big deal.
We got everything riding on this.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.326
We've quit our jobs, I have three children
to think about now. How about that?

01:35.480 --> 01:39.166
Think about this. You do a good job now,
you're gonna make your boys very proud.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.530
- Girls. I have three girls, dude.
- Hmm? Right. You can't even tell at that age.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.047
- They basically look like potatoes with arms.
- Don't call my kids potatoes.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.049
- Respect the kids.
- Don't piss him off.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.645
- They wear pink!
- Calm him down.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.404
A lot of guys wear pink.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.722
- I have a pink polo shirt that I love.
- Come on.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.764
- Can we get a roll of paper towels?
- Can I get paper towels?!

01:56.920 --> 02:00.242
Why are you barking at people?
He's saying please, you're just barking.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.129
- Bad manners.
- Buddy, dry your face.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.089
- He's freaking out.
- It's unbelievable.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.483
- Can you go on without me?
- Why don't you wait in the car?

02:07.640 --> 02:10.007
Stop, this is gonna be easy.
You have to calm down.

02:10.160 --> 02:14.006
Look, Nick's gonna hit them with facts
and figures, because he's the brains, right?

02:14.160 --> 02:17.801
You talk about how you and your wife fucked
and made three potatoes with arms.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.964
You're the heart. Me,
I'll do my thing, get in where I fit in.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.242
- You're the soul?
- No, I'm the dick and balls.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.323
- Got it.
- Why would I wanna be the soul?

02:25.480 --> 02:28.882
- Just don't pass out. Just keep breathing.
- See? This will be easy.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.641
- All we have to do is be ourselves.
- Let's not. Ourselves is a Dumpster fire.

02:32.800 --> 02:37.089
- Let's be better. Let's try to elevate a little.
- That's a good note. Nobody be themselves.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.163
All right, we're back in 20 seconds.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.129
Hey, fellas, thanks for coming.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.363
- Nice to meet you.
- Good morning. How are you?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.727
Hey, my man. There's trouble.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.609
- Too much.
- Well, he went with it.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.081
- Dale Arbus.
- Pleasure to meet you, man.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.447
- Thanks for coming on. This will be fun.
- Yeah.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.250
Does that zip all the way down?

02:55.600 --> 02:57.887
And we're back in five, four...

02:59.360 --> 03:03.445
<i>Get up, get up, get up, and get out</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:06.763
<i>Ha, ha! And we're back.
You know, every week we like to highlight...</i>

03:06.920 --> 03:09.890
<i>...local inventors and entrepreneurs
in our Big Idea Spotlight.</i>

03:10.080 --> 03:11.127
<i>That's right, Mike.</i>

03:11.280 --> 03:13.203
<i>And today we have
three modern-day...</i>

03:13.520 --> 03:18.208
<i>...Edisons who've created a new shower gadget
they hope to really clean up with.</i>

03:20.040 --> 03:23.647
<i>Please, welcome Nick, Kurt and Dale.</i>

03:23.800 --> 03:27.361
<i>- Pleasure to be here.
- Before we get to the product, can you tell us...</i>

03:27.560 --> 03:31.610
<i>...what is it that inspired three regular Joes
to go into business for yourselves?</i>

03:31.760 --> 03:34.843
<i>We were all working at pretty terrible jobs
for some awful bosses.</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:38.766
<i>And thought if we got a chance to be
our own bosses, we'd do things differently.</i>

03:38.920 --> 03:40.126
<i>This might be our shot.</i>

03:40.320 --> 03:43.403
<i>We didn't think we'd get the chance,
but Dale had an amazing idea.</i>

03:43.560 --> 03:44.641
<i>Don't go to Dale.</i>

03:44.800 --> 03:47.690
<i>And, uh, we started meeting together
to talk about the invention...</i>

03:47.840 --> 03:49.808
<i>...instead of complaining about our jobs.</i>

03:49.960 --> 03:51.291
<i>Hey, I think that's exciting.</i>

03:52.840 --> 03:55.650
<i>Dale, you know, I just wanna know,
where did the idea come from...</i>

03:55.800 --> 03:57.640
<i>- ...for a new showerhead?
- I have three kids.</i>

03:59.000 --> 04:00.286
<i>So that's the heart.</i>

04:00.440 --> 04:03.011
<i>- That's</i> a <i>blessing.
- Yeah, well, he has triplets.</i>

04:03.160 --> 04:06.289
<i>In all honesty, it's too many.
I'm pretty overwhelmed.</i>

04:06.440 --> 04:08.647
<i>Well, he's got them on his mind, clearly.</i>

04:08.800 --> 04:10.240
<i>Uh, let me answer the question.</i>

04:10.320 --> 04:13.563
<i>Dale, uh, had just gotten back
from one of those self-service car washes...</i>

04:13.720 --> 04:16.803
<i>- ...with the wand with the soap.
- It's got everything in one thing.</i>

04:16.959 --> 04:19.803
<i>He thought, "Why don't they make
one of these for your body?"</i>

04:19.959 --> 04:22.691
<i>After we had a few beers,
we came up with the, uh, Shower Buddy.</i>

04:22.840 --> 04:25.650
<i>- The Shower Buddy?
- I'm sorry, that name's not official yet.</i>

04:25.800 --> 04:28.690
<i>- No, he's wrong. It is official.
- I wanted the "Shower Daddy."</i>

04:28.840 --> 04:32.208
<i>- "Shower Daddy" is worse on every level.
- I have to agree with Nick.</i>

04:32.360 --> 04:34.488
<i>Better than having
some strange dude with you.</i>

04:34.640 --> 04:37.883
<i>It's not some strange dude,
as I've said many times. It's your buddy.</i>

04:38.040 --> 04:40.840
<i>- Why would your buddy be in the shower?
- Why would your dad?</i>

04:40.960 --> 04:43.361
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Don't scream on television.</i>

04:43.520 --> 04:46.683
<i>You know what? How about you fellas
show us how this gizmo works?</i>

04:46.840 --> 04:50.731
<i>- Right? Let's get it going. Ha, ha.
- Yes. Make it rain. Yes. Work it, work it.</i>

04:51.040 --> 04:52.883
<i>Oh, this is awesome.</i>

04:53.040 --> 04:56.249
<i>Kurt's gonna turn on the shower.
You're gonna see the water come out.</i>

04:56.440 --> 05:00.729
<i>After a bit, the shampoo's gonna automatically
be triggered out of the showerhead...</i>

05:00.880 --> 05:02.564
<i>- No water pressure.
- The blue handle.</i>

05:02.720 --> 05:04.927
<i>- No water pressure.
- There's a pump on the back.</i>

05:05.080 --> 05:08.368
<i>- I could pump it manually.
- Dale's gonna help out. Thank you, buddy.</i>

05:08.520 --> 05:10.045
- Pump.
- You got it?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.241
- I got it.
- Yeah?

05:11.400 --> 05:14.165
Water comes out,
the shampoo mixes with the water...

05:14.320 --> 05:16.209
<i>...then shortly after that, conditioner.</i>

05:16.360 --> 05:18.727
<i>You shower in half the time
with the Shower Buddy.</i>

05:18.920 --> 05:23.084
<i>The average American... I don't know if you
know this.... spends 50 hours</i> a <i>week working.</i>

05:23.960 --> 05:26.486
- Hand's cramping up.
- Here, let me help.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.246
<i>- -Commuting.
If we can save you just five minutes...</i>

05:29.400 --> 05:32.006
- The whole rod's too dry, right?
- Yeah, spit on it.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.086
- Better?
- See, yeah. If you lube it up, it's better.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.605
<i>Oh, no, absolutely.</i>

05:37.760 --> 05:41.003
<i>I'm sorry. There's a hole in the back.
I'm gonna stick my finger in it.</i>

05:41.160 --> 05:44.687
<i>We don't really care how you get it done.
Just get it done. Get it finished.</i>

05:44.840 --> 05:46.729
<i>- Whatever it takes.
- Live TV, right?</i>

05:46.880 --> 05:48.609
<i>Live TV. What are you gonna do?</i>

05:48.760 --> 05:50.480
<i>- Yeah. Here we go.
- Oh, here it comes.</i>

05:50.600 --> 05:52.170
<i>Hey!</i>

05:52.320 --> 05:54.402
<i>- I told you.
- Works just as promised, okay?</i>

05:54.560 --> 05:57.609
<i>- Now, go ahead and shut it off.
- It's so cool. I want one.</i>

05:57.760 --> 06:01.685
<i>You can't have this one. It's the prototype.
But we're looking for partners.</i>

06:01.880 --> 06:04.121
<i>I'll tell you right now. I'm sold.
I wanna invest.</i>

06:04.280 --> 06:06.044
<i>We got one. All right, Mike.</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:08.282
<i>Now, how would I get in touch
with you guys?</i>

06:08.440 --> 06:11.728
<i>- You go straight to Nickkurtdale.
- I'm sorry, what?</i>

06:11.880 --> 06:13.723
<i>It's our website. Nickkurtdale. com.</i>

06:14.600 --> 06:16.807
<i>I'm positive I'm not hearing that right.</i>

06:17.120 --> 06:19.009
<i>It's our names: Nick, Kurt, Dale.</i>

06:19.720 --> 06:21.563
Nickkurtdale.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.482
<i>Y'all gotta change that name.</i>

06:26.280 --> 06:28.487
Cannot believe
we never said it out loud before.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.642
It looked so good on paper.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.010
It was a nice dream while it lasted, but I think
it's time we all go beg for our jobs back.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.488
Maybe just accept the fact
that we'll always be cogs in the machine.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.041
Wait. Cocks in the machine. What is that?

06:41.200 --> 06:42.565
"Cogs." Guh.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.451
You know what? You're right.
We're not boss material.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.170
We're worker bees. We're grunts.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.845
Oh, boy. That song. I can't hear that now.
Just put it on vibrate.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.047
- Will you stop?
- Please?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.965
- I picked this song to inspire us.
- It's not inspiring me.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.690
Look at this. Unknown caller.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.080
- Just answer it.
- Hello?

06:59.400 --> 07:02.165
Yup, this is one of the Shower Buddy guys.
Mm-hm.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.963
Really? Yes. No, of course.
I know exactly who you are.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.804
Look up "Boulder Stream." Boulder Stream.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.611
Uh-huh. Thank you.
We're very proud of the product.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.889
- E-mail us the details, that'll be fine.
- Is that a real thing?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.644
- Yeah, my e-mail?
- Not yours.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.531
Yeah, it's phatballllz@hotmail.com.

07:18.680 --> 07:22.924
It's P-H-A-T-B-A-L-L...

07:23.080 --> 07:26.084
...L-L-Z...

07:26.400 --> 07:27.447
...@hotmail.com.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.011
Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.400
- See you tomorrow.
- Wow.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.086
Holy shit.
Boulder Stream loves the Shower Buddy.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.765
Who the fuck is Boulder Stream?

07:34.920 --> 07:38.288
Only one of the largest catalog retailers
in North America.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.802
<i>You're gonna hear me roar</i>

07:43.040 --> 07:44.280
Nice.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.484
When you're in a good mood,
it's a good song. Bad mood, bad song.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.051
That's art. That's good art.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.728
- Man, this place is legit.
- Yeah, it's nice.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.521
- Did you see the free cookies?
- Yeah, you clearly have. That's four of those.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.082
- You're gonna have chocolate on your face.
- When we meet this guy...

08:02.240 --> 08:05.369
...when you shake his hand,
use your other hand and touch his elbow.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.171
- It's a classy move.
- I don't know this move. Let me see.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.924
- Like that.
- Please, both sit down.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.889
- That's nice.
- How about that? Not bad.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.611
- That's really good.
- You got chocolate on your fingers.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.961
Now it's on my jacket.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.964
- Put water on it.
- I don't need water. That will set it.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.283
- Get the cookie away from me.
- No, it's like a fire-on-fire thing.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.561
No, the water will set it.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.246
Ha! There they are.
There are my shower buddies.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.930
How are you? In the flesh.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.402
It's just like on that morning show.
You're always fighting. I love it.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.005
- Yeah, it's a...
- Rex Hanson.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.049
- Oh, hey. Kurt Buckman.
- Good to see you.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.890
- Nice to see you.
- Classy handshake.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.610
- Nick Hendricks.
- Nick, pleasure.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.126
Hey, uh, Dale Arb... Uh...

08:40.280 --> 08:42.880
- Shoot. I just learned it.
- We can do it whichever way you want.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.681
- Right?
- To be clear, we're not racist.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.524
Well, that's good. We can use that.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.843
Why don't we grab the refreshments, coffee?
Grab some cookies.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.209
Let's head upstairs. Let's talk
about this product. Is that corduroy?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.728
Step inside. Dreams do come true.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.484
You guys want something to drink?

09:00.680 --> 09:01.966
- I'll take one.
- Sure.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.726
- No. It's very early.
- No for us. Sorry.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.805
I'm gonna cut right to it, gentlemen.
The Shower Buddy: a home run.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.361
Well, Mr. Hanson, we couldn't be happier...

09:11.520 --> 09:14.967
Mr. Hanson is my father. It's "Rex."

09:15.120 --> 09:18.010
Please, sit down. Get comfortable.
Take a seat.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.330
We want you to know that we are a company you
can be very proud to be in business with.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.405
- Our workers are all gonna have health care...
- I don't really give a shit about that.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.325
Do you see this?
This is Jimi Hendrix's actual guitar.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.520
Heh, yeah. The one he did the fire and fingers
thing with. You like cool shit like this?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.523
- We love cool shit.
- I'm into cool shit.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.166
- You like fucking samurais?
- Samurais? Sure.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.642
I knew you did. Get into business with me,
you're gonna have fucking loads of it.

09:41.960 --> 09:46.124
- So you are offering to carry our product...?
- Wait a minute. Check this out.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.487
Miss Lang, will you come in here a moment?

09:48.640 --> 09:49.971
Now what?

09:51.480 --> 09:52.891
Jesus fucking Christ.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.651
Sweetheart, we were racking our brains.
What's a beer can made out of?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.251
Do you mean aluminum?

10:01.120 --> 10:03.726
- That'll be all, Miss Lang. Thank you.
- Okay.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.245
And where does she go now?

10:06.400 --> 10:10.007
Now, that is the kind of cool shit
you have to look forward to.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.243
Best part about this deal:
you're not gonna have to lift a finger.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.131
My company will assume
all future product development...

10:16.280 --> 10:18.009
...outsource manufacturing to China...

10:18.160 --> 10:20.731
...and you receive a handsome one-time
development fee.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.168
- I wanna dig in on the one-time fee because...
- You see this football?

10:24.320 --> 10:28.245
This is the one Peyton Manning threw and
the guy caught it in his helmet. Keep it.

10:28.760 --> 10:33.163
You know, Rex, the one-time fee thing, we're
not looking to give up control of the company.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.887
Right. We wanna handle all the manufacturing
and you guys do distribution.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.646
What, you manufacture? Here, in America?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.007
- That's the plan.
- The American-dream thing.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.761
Boys, I hate to break it to you,
but the American dream, it's made in China.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.366
Now, look, I respect your Naïveté, uh...

10:48.520 --> 10:51.763
...but I'm afraid that this deal
only happens one way.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.962
I did say "handsome fee," right?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.930
Can I have one minute?
Just love to talk to my partners.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.765
You got it. Take your time.
I'll be over here.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.281
- Oh, boy.
- Man.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.841
- What do you think?
- I didn't wanna say anything...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.241
...but he means Eli Manning,
not Peyton Manning.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.246
- Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Kurt.
- I think she has an amazing fucking body...

11:12.440 --> 11:15.489
...but that accent puts her over the top.
It's insane. That dress.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.722
Agreed on both points. How about the deal?

11:17.880 --> 11:19.962
- The deal. Gotta take it.
- We should take it.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.521
- Take the money and get out.
- He's got cool shit.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.445
- Imagine having your own cool shit.
- But look at this place.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.171
I mean, these guys make loads of money
selling stuff...

11:28.320 --> 11:30.687
...and he just called our Shower Buddy
a home run.

11:30.840 --> 11:34.367
- Why sell a home run for a one-time fee?
- That's a good point.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.330
I don't know. I could use the
money for Stacy and the girls.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.926
That's a good point. That's true.
I could use money.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.560
I get that.
But maybe it's not just about the money.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.921
That's a good point.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.050
Maybe it's about never having to work
for anybody ever again.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.407
- That's right.
- Right? Being our own bosses.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.329
- I say we bet on ourselves.
- Me too.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.601
- You're right.
- I'm in.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.921
I'm in. Let's do it.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.367
Okay. Rex. Ahem.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.329
- Uh, no deal.
- Sorry.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.687
- We're, uh, betting on ourselves.
- Is that right?

12:00.840 --> 12:04.049
Yeah. And no hard feelings.
Honestly, we really appreciate the offer.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.483
- Sorry.
- Yeah. I can respect that.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.565
Takes some serious balls to walk away
from 3 million bucks.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.007
Hang on. Three million dollars?
We'll take that.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.650
Sorry. Offer's off the table.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.041
We'll take half. Half is fine.
Can we have half?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.362
Ship's sailed.
Thank you so much for coming in.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.569
Dale, I'm gonna need that ball back.
Good luck building something in America.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.564
You know...

12:26.360 --> 12:30.490
...I built this company from the bottom up
here in America.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.765
- Dad, I didn't know you were back.
- What'd I tell you about using my office?

12:34.920 --> 12:38.208
- I know, I just thought, you know...
- Bert Hanson.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.765
You're the Shower Buddy guys?

12:39.920 --> 12:41.490
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah. We are, sir.

12:41.640 --> 12:46.441
I respect you gentlemen for wanting to roll
up your sleeves and build something...

12:46.600 --> 12:48.648
...stake your claim.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.406
Now, I came to this country with nothing.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.568
And through risk and hard work,
I made my own American dream come true.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.442
- Good for you.
- Well, here's what I'm gonna do.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.926
I'll refer you to my contact
at Pacific Shore National.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.084
- That's a bank.
- They won't balk at giving you a loan...

13:09.240 --> 13:14.644
...once they hear that Bert Hanson just has
placed an initial order of, say, um...

13:17.720 --> 13:18.767
...100,000 units?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.207
- A hundred-thousand Shower Buddies?
- Whoa. Ha!

13:21.400 --> 13:23.323
You're gonna make
100,000 Shower Buddies?

13:24.680 --> 13:27.445
Dad, what are you talking about?
We never make this kind of deal.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.766
I'm sorry, sir.

13:31.280 --> 13:34.489
But Boulder Stream needs to be
your exclusive retailer.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.725
- Uh, let's think it over. Of course.
- We won't pick up the phone if anyone calls.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.491
- We have a deal?
- Yeah, you got a fucking deal.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.883
- Hey, all right. There it is.
- I got his elbow. Yeah.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.930
- I got some chocolate on you there.
- It doesn't matter.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.890
That's great. That is good news.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.405
So it's 20,000 square feet,
but it's a minimum five-year lease.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.251
Twenty thousand.
That sounds like a lot more than we need.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.602
But we want something
we can grow into, right?

14:00.760 --> 14:04.048
- And we have a really big order, Nick.
- Damn straight. Come on, Nick.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.050
- Nick. Nick.
- I don't know.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.641
- You know, I say we take it. I say we take it.
- Yes.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.650
- Yes, we do.
- Excellent.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.645
You've got no work experience at all.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.961
Is that bad?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.485
Are you kidding? It's great.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.325
- You're enthusiastic and you're unjaded.
- And unqualified.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.642
- You know what? You're hired.
- Oops.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.646
- Really?
- That was unexpected and, uh, undeserving.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.847
You're hired.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.006
That's a yes. That's an obvious yes.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.721
- Well, again, uh...
- No résumé at all.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.487
Don't need it. Your eyes speak.
You seem honest.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.687
Hold on, pal.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.808
- Um, you're hired.
- Really?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.042
- I mean, if you'll have us.
- Thank you.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.566
- Becoming faster now.
- Well...

15:31.720 --> 15:34.644
- Can you start on Saturday evening?
- Absolutely.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.450
Okay, great, I'll get ahold of you.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.729
- Says here you've been convicted of a felony.
- That was bullshit.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.963
Word up, though, I get that, man.
Like, pfft, I had a similar thing.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.249
They tried to peg me as a child sex
offender. It was total bullshit.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.244
Oh, yo, yo, yo.
I ain't down with no kid-fuckers.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.404
- I'm not down with kid shit either.
- Yeah, none of us are.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.210
N-to-the-O, brother.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.601
We do not support that at all.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.641
But, you know, let's just give the guy a job.
Just... Yeah. I don't wanna upset this guy.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.922
Well, tell you what, Tiffany. You're hired.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.242
- I'm hired?
- Yeah, you are.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.886
- There you go. There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.771
We'll see you later. See you Monday.
Get out of here.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.366
Kurt, you gotta stop hiring
hot unqualified women.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.251
What's the point of being boss
if you can't stock the pond?

16:17.400 --> 16:20.085
You realize you can't sleep
with these women?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.200
- What?
- You're the boss. It's sexual harassment.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.284
Remember sexual harassment?
I tried to kill my boss. Ring a bell?

16:25.440 --> 16:27.568
I gotta fire them all now?
We just hired them.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.803
You can't fire them because you're not
allowed to sleep with them.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.041
Also sexual harassment.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.369
Why are we even doing this, then?

16:36.360 --> 16:38.442
All right, let's talk dress code.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.850
- Forget it.
- There is no dress code.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.606
- Come on.
- You can dress however you want.

16:44.760 --> 16:48.242
Whatever makes you feel comfortable...
Well, there goes a shirt. All right.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.646
- It's a choice.
- Well...

16:49.800 --> 16:53.088
That's the wrong choice, though.
Gotta wear a shirt. That's the one...

16:53.280 --> 16:56.489
He's walking away from me.
He might have been a bad hire.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.010
Who's having fun, huh?

17:06.160 --> 17:07.286
Hey, guys.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.840
Everybody seems very happy.
This was a great idea.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.367
Yeah, I know.
This could be an issue, though.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.089
It is Bring Your Kids to Work Day,
not Put Your Kids to Work Day.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.527
They're not working.
They consider this playing.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.484
I tried to tell them to stop,
and they started crying.

17:22.680 --> 17:25.523
- They have boxed 1200 units already.
- Unethical... 1200?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.522
- Yeah.
- Well, that's productive, though.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.523
- Yeah.
- And they seem happy.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.480
- Let them play another ten minutes, maybe.
- I say we let them play through lunch.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.041
- Yeah. Legally I think I'll change the sign.
- Yeah.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.968
Oh, boy. This is it.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.730
Here we go. Here we go.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.882
- We did it. We're at 100,000.
- We did it?

18:01.040 --> 18:03.088
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.120
Woo-hoo-hoo!

18:05.600 --> 18:08.160
- This is a great idea.
- How do you think they mow this?

18:08.280 --> 18:11.170
- Sure we shouldn't have called ahead?
- No. He's gonna love it.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.681
Cake and balloons.
Don't think that's overdoing it?

18:13.840 --> 18:17.049
No. I think he's gonna be psyched
the order's done three days early.

18:17.240 --> 18:20.084
I think he's gonna be flipping out
to see us out on his course.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.886
I wouldn't be surprised
if he gives us a membership.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.286
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.647
Oh, my God. I want that.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.761
Yeah!

18:29.960 --> 18:31.200
Surprise. Ha, ha.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.250
Sir, we finished your order
and it is ready to be shipped.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.245
Excellent news.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.529
We got you a little cake that says,
"Thanks for believing in us!"

18:39.720 --> 18:41.961
- And some balloons of course.
- We're the "us."

18:42.120 --> 18:44.600
Congratulations, boys.
What an accomplishment.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.291
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.321
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to cancel that order.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.760
What'd he say?

18:50.920 --> 18:53.400
- Sounded like he said "cancel the order."
- What?

18:53.560 --> 18:56.131
- Cancel what?
- Cancel the order.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.920
Don't need it.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.447
- Wait, no. That doesn't work.
- You can't do that.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.410
- We went 500 grand in the hole.
- We were in business.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.287
- If you don't buy, we are ruined.
- It's a $500,000 order.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.001
- The American dream and all that.
- He's gonna putt. He's just gonna putt.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.131
- He makes the putt.
- Can you explain what's happening?

19:14.280 --> 19:17.204
- And why you're doing this?
- Yeah, sure. Fair question.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.125
You see, boys, in one week
your bridge loan comes due...

19:20.280 --> 19:21.930
...and you won't be able to pay it.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.563
And your loan officer has assured me
no extension will be granted.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.724
At that moment,
your company will go into foreclosure...

19:29.880 --> 19:33.327
...and I will buy all of those units
at auction for pennies on the dollar.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.046
Cheaper than I could have gotten them
from the Chinese.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.282
- Oh, my fucking God.
- I can't believe this.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.171
Anyway, as an added bonus,
I will also own your patent...

19:41.360 --> 19:44.842
...and these gentlemen here will take over
manufacturing of our new product:

19:45.000 --> 19:46.365
The Shower Pal.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.965
- It's a better name too.
- It is.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.525
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking hell.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.082
Oh, Dad, that is a hell of a fucking play.

19:53.240 --> 19:57.290
We should fit these guys for crowns
because they just got fucked royally.

19:58.640 --> 20:04.283
Rex. No call for this MTV showboating.
They're aware of their defeat.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.649
In these moments,
it's more impactful to be still.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.728
What about that stuff about hard work
and starting a company in America?

20:11.880 --> 20:14.121
- The American dream and hard work.
- All bullshit?

20:14.280 --> 20:17.409
You honestly think
hard work creates wealth?

20:19.040 --> 20:21.646
The only thing that
creates wealth is wealth.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.404
And we have it. You don't.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.040
Okay. Okay. You know what?

20:27.400 --> 20:29.562
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I got it. Hey.

20:30.080 --> 20:33.402
Listen, bucko. You don't wanna
make enemies out of us, okay?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.888
Whoa, easy. I didn't walk all up on you.

20:39.120 --> 20:42.363
I make new enemies every day.
It's called business.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.366
Thank you, gentlemen, for stopping by.
Have a lovely day.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.760
Rex, get the cake.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.601
Ow.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.208
Rich motherfucking, overprivileged,
fucking assholes.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.209
What happened to decency?

20:59.400 --> 21:00.845
- I'm gonna lose my house.
- Yeah.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.480
Stacy's gonna divorce me.
She's gonna marry some dude.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.610
<i>- I'll</i> have supervised visits at McDonald's.
- Fucking McDonald's.

21:06.760 --> 21:09.889
What were we thinking? Who bets
on themselves? Why did we do that?

21:10.080 --> 21:12.447
- What?
- You're the one who talked me into it.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.886
I was on the fence.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.290
We're fucked! Our employees are fucked.
What about them? What about Lupe?

21:18.440 --> 21:22.240
This is just a problem. That means
all we gotta do is come up with a solution.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.129
We'll put some ideas up on the board.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.011
That's what I'm talking about.
Here we go. Let's go.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.130
- No idea's a bad idea.
- No idea's a bad idea.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.964
- Who's gonna start us off?
- I got it.

21:32.800 --> 21:33.881
- Kurt.
- Kill these motherfuckers.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.122
- No, no.
- Murder! Yes.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.521
- You don't need to write that down.
- Kill them.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.251
- Let's fucking kill them! I want them dead!
- Kill them.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.049
- We open up their brains and shove them...
- Then we fuck the skulls!

21:46.000 --> 21:48.446
- I'm getting that taste, Nick.
- They're fucking dead!

21:48.600 --> 21:51.922
- We're fucking doing it again!
- That's the Chicago way!

21:52.120 --> 21:54.521
- Chicago way! Cut them open.
I want his family dead.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.445
I want his house burned down,
and I'll get a baseball bat.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.120
- Come on, man, come on.
- Fuck their skulls!

22:01.280 --> 22:02.486
- Come on.
- Come on.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.485
We'll fucking kill them.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.610
If we've learned one thing about
ourselves, it's that we're not murderers.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.485
- How does killing them get us our money?
- What do you mean?

22:11.680 --> 22:14.251
You harvest their organs,
sell them on the black market.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.529
Be fucking serious. Come on.
This is not helpful. Think seriously.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.251
You're right. There's other
things people have done.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.851
- There's plots.
- For money.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.447
- The plot of the movie <i>Speed.</i>
- Yes, there you go. Put a bomb on a bus.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.082
So we'll rig a bus so that when it goes
below 50 miles an hour, it blows up.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.886
- What the fuck is that?
- You said no idea was a bad idea.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.850
I was wrong. That idea sucks,
the movie sucks and so do you.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.361
That movie introduced us to Sandy Bullock.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.126
Fuck you! I love Sandra Bullock!
I'm running hot.

22:40.280 --> 22:43.363
I'm sorry. I'm running hot.
The whole fucking thing's got me upset.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.488
Give me the marker,
I'll get a better idea.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.166
Want the marker?
Give me $500,000, that's what we need.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.846
- Gonna hold the marker ransom?
- Call it what you want.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.891
I need a half a million dollars.
I don't need shit ideas and a bunch of hot air.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.610
Come on.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.205
Dale.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.283
- Boom. Marker drop.
- "Kidnaping."

23:04.480 --> 23:07.563
- That's "kidnapping."
- With one more P it is. That's "kidnaping."

23:07.720 --> 23:11.611
However the fuck you spell it. You know what
I'm talking about. Kidnapping. Come on.

23:11.760 --> 23:16.209
Wait a second. That's a fucking great idea.
Think about it. First of all, we kidnap Rex.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.169
- We get money from Bert.
- Ransom money.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.321
We save the business.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.481
No one has to die.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.563
- Nobody gets hurt.
- He is the kid of Bert.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.245
Right, but he's not super young.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.529
- So it's not super douchey and shit.
- It's not all molesty and shit.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.729
What do you know
about executing a kidnapping?

23:30.880 --> 23:33.486
- What do you mean? You just...
- You get zip ties.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.729
You don't know shit about kidnapping.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.282
Okay, we don't know a ton.
But I bet we know someone that does.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.125
- Who?
- Motherfucker Jones.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.851
- Oh, Jesus.
- Wouldn't it be good to see him?

23:45.000 --> 23:49.767
We're not gonna go see Motherfucker Jones
because we're not gonna "kidnape" anyone.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.890
Come on, this guy's a
master business prick.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.771
He's at the top of his game.
We need to figure out...

23:58.320 --> 24:00.402
Boy, look what we got.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.841
Is that a Sharpie?

24:03.040 --> 24:05.771
- Hang on. What was a Sharpie doing there?
- You put it there.

24:05.960 --> 24:06.961
I did put it on there.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.964
- You're in charge of marker distribution.
- I know I'm the marker guy.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.726
Permanently on the board now.

24:11.880 --> 24:16.283
This illustrates my point, idiots.
We need to find somebody who's legitimate.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.922
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.441
Hello, Nick...

24:36.880 --> 24:38.166
...guy who saved my life...

24:38.760 --> 24:40.171
...guy who fucked my wife.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.244
It was a blow job. It was a blow job, only.
Didn't fuck her.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.641
You got my e-mail?

24:44.800 --> 24:47.804
I did. And I was very amused by it.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.163
I know Bert Hanson. I
like the cut of his jib.

24:51.320 --> 24:56.167
And I admire the way he bent you three idiots
over a barrel and showed you the 50 states.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.846
- Ah. See? Told you it was a saying.
- Wow.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.288
Now, Nick, just tell me something.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.569
Why would you start production...

25:05.720 --> 25:09.486
...without at least a guarantee
of 35 percent down...

25:09.640 --> 25:11.642
...to cover manufacturing costs?

25:11.800 --> 25:15.009
I mean, why would you do that?

25:15.200 --> 25:17.567
- Is he telling a joke?
- Is something funny?

25:19.120 --> 25:22.090
Uh, we assumed that we were dealing
with somebody who was ethical...

25:22.240 --> 25:26.211
No, that's the wrong answer.
The right answer is because...

25:26.360 --> 25:29.967
...you're all fucking morons.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.161
Boy, he shined a light on that, didn't he?
That's true. You're absolutely right.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.924
You thought I was such a bad boss.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.448
But, I don't know, I think running
your own company into the ground...

25:39.640 --> 25:44.043
...ruining the livelihood of your employees
is maybe a bit worse. What do you think?

25:44.200 --> 25:47.044
- That's fair.
- Should I be on the phone if I'm taking notes?

25:47.200 --> 25:51.091
- I'm not getting any of what he's saying.
- It's just a lot of rhetorical questions.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.163
So, what do you want from me, Nick?

25:53.720 --> 25:57.247
With all due respect,
you know what makes a guy like that tick.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.688
So if you could give us some advice
on how to get our money back...

26:00.840 --> 26:04.765
...I will play real nice at your next
parole hearing. How does that sound?

26:06.320 --> 26:08.561
- You would do that for me?
- Yes, I would.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.845
Okay. I think I can help you.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.924
He's gonna help? Okay, I got a notepad.
I got a notepad.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.491
From a legal standpoint...

26:16.640 --> 26:17.766
"Legal standpoint."

26:17.920 --> 26:19.490
...your options are...

26:19.680 --> 26:21.409
- "Options are..."
- Legal options.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.927
...jack fucking shit.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.321
I heard "Jack Leibowitz."
Is that an attorney?

26:26.520 --> 26:29.000
<i>- I'll</i> write that down.
- Can we get his contact info?

26:29.560 --> 26:32.564
Even if you had the money
to fight him in the courts...

26:32.720 --> 26:36.008
...his lawyers are just gonna file motions
and continuances...

26:36.160 --> 26:39.801
...long after you three
pissant little fuckups...

26:39.960 --> 26:41.962
...have blown your tiny little brains out.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.685
You saying nothing can be done?

26:43.840 --> 26:45.968
No, I said there's nothing you can do.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.528
There's plenty that could be done,
but you won't do it.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.604
- And do you wanna know why?
- No, not really.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.889
- Because you have no balls.
- I see.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.883
And your fathers had no balls.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.010
You are all a product of generations
of ball-less men...

27:01.160 --> 27:04.687
...who were too weak or too frightened
to stand up and take what was theirs.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.366
And one day, you will pass on...

27:07.560 --> 27:12.407
...your empty, shriveled sacs
to your own pitiful offspring.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.450
- I can't hear. What is he talking about?
- Our nut sacs, mostly.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.601
How'd that come up?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.730
- Why don't you pitch him the kidnapping?
- Let the kidnapping go.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.531
- Pitch him the kidnapping.
- Show some balls, all right?

27:22.680 --> 27:24.205
Wanna see balls? Kidnap someone.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.000
You'll end up in here. You'll see
plenty of balls on your forehead.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.003
- Mm.
- Why are they on my forehead?

27:29.160 --> 27:31.320
- Was the dick on top of my head?
- Makes no sense.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.250
- Oh, I'm upside down.
- You sure are. Your face is getting fucked.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.600
Motherfucker.

27:50.760 --> 27:55.846
Mm-hm. So y'all plan to use the ransom
to save your business.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.446
- Exactly, yeah. That's it.
- That's what we're hoping.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.490
Will you tell these idiots
how stupid that is, please?

28:01.840 --> 28:02.887
Ah. I like it.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.565
- Nice. See?
- I knew he'd like it.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.530
You're doing what you need to
to keep your business going.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.126
I had a dream for a long time
to get my own business.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.281
Yeah.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.967
I wanted to open my own Pinkberry.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.160
- Ha, ha.
- What the fuck is the chuckles about?

28:16.280 --> 28:17.964
Oh, I thought you were joking.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.886
See how many crackers line up to get
that Captain Crunch-covered freezing shit?

28:22.040 --> 28:24.850
- I eat it three times a week. I love Pinkberry.
- Hey, that's awesome.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.082
- You like Pinkberry?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.288
- Right.
- You got an African-American belly?

28:29.440 --> 28:32.728
- Because black people suffer from lactose.
- Oh, okay, good, well...

28:32.880 --> 28:35.201
- We got some kind of kinship.
- Yeah, cool, man.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.084
- Stool soft?
- It can be.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.925
- Bottom tender.
- Yeah, bottom's fine.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.129
If somebody took my Pinkberry,
I wouldn't take that sitting down.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.210
- You would fight.
- I will cut a motherfucker in half.

28:46.360 --> 28:50.081
You wouldn't kidnap someone
because you can't successfully pull it off.

28:50.240 --> 28:52.288
Name me a kidnapping movie...

28:52.440 --> 28:55.523
...where the kidnappers weren't dead
or incarcerated at the end.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.205
- 9 <i>to</i> 5, asshole.
- 9 <i>to</i> 5.

28:57.360 --> 29:00.045
- Name me two movies, then.
- You said name one.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.204
- I nailed one right on you.
- 9 <i>to 5</i> was this movie...

29:03.360 --> 29:07.046
I know what the fuck <i>9 to 5</i> is.
It's about the white bitch with the big titties.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.328
- Yeah.
- She got old, the titties stayed young.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.642
I'm not gonna kidnap someone
based on <i>9 to</i> 5.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.565
- That's because you Jane Fonda.
- You're the scaredy-cat one.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.530
You're always the last to man up.
You're dragging your feet.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.251
Why are you here
if you're not gonna participate?

29:20.440 --> 29:23.444
First of all, if anyone,
I'm the smart one. I'm Lily Tomlin.

29:23.600 --> 29:27.161
- But I won't have this conversation.
- Please, I'm Lily Tomlin, if anybody is.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.926
Sitting in the big chair,
giving David O. Russell shit.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.124
- Yeah, he's got the 'tude. You're Fonda, man.
- You're Jane Fonda.

29:33.280 --> 29:37.330
- That makes you Dolly Parton.
- Great. Woman's got her own theme park.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.881
- She's a national treasure.
- Two national treasures.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.361
Can I pose a question to you colonizers?

29:43.320 --> 29:44.651
Happened a long time ago.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.089
How do you kidnap somebody
without them knowing...

29:48.400 --> 29:50.084
...they've been kidnapped?

29:50.400 --> 29:53.768
- Okay.
- You smarten up, and you don't even do it.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.730
- He's a black sphinx. I like it.
- He threw a riddle our way.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.321
- How do you...?
- Voodoo. Voodoo?

29:59.520 --> 30:01.443
I can give you the answers.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.804
- Fifty thousand.
- No.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.405
- We can't.
- Six hundred?

30:06.840 --> 30:08.683
You should not run a Pinkberry. Sorry.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.366
- The weirdest negotiating style.
- We don't have money.

30:11.520 --> 30:15.161
You know, we're here because
we have zero dollars. We're broke.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.720
Fuck it. Give me the watch.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.211
- Nope.
- Give him your watch.

30:18.360 --> 30:22.206
- I'm not giving him this. This is a Tag Heuer.
- This is a wrist without a watch.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.204
Come on. It's just material things.
Can't take it with you.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.840
You can borrow it
while you tell us a shitty plan.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.361
All right.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.526
Slip him a mickey.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.682
Give me the watch back.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.365
You sneak into his crib at night.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.609
Find out whatever his beverage of choice is
before he goes to bed.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.287
You slip the mickey in the beverage.
Knock him out nice and easy.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.523
And you keep that bitch sedated
until Daddy pays up.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.331
It's not a crazy idea,
but it's not worth a Swiss watch.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.324
- That could work.
- Hmm. That's great. That makes total sense.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.802
- He doesn't see our faces.
- We're ghosts. We don't even exist.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.800
- When you say "mickey... "?
- A date-rape drug. Where do you get those?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.207
- Where do I get them?
- Uh... Yeah.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.523
Because of the hue of my skin
I know where to get date-rape drugs?

31:08.720 --> 31:11.769
- You brought up the date-raping.
- You got N word in your eyes.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.287
- Why are your eyes saying the N word?
- Klan eyes.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.761
- You've got Klan eyes.
- You ever take a eye test?

31:16.920 --> 31:18.604
- Yes.
- All you pick out is the K.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.603
- I see every letter.
- He does have Klan eyes.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.922
You can see them poking out
behind that sheet.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.926
- It's just ridic... I can't... It's so upsetting.
- Let me ask you a question.

31:27.080 --> 31:30.687
When you got raped by Julia, what did she
use to knock you out? Laughing gas?

31:30.840 --> 31:32.001
- Oh, right.
- That'll work.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.487
- That's interesting.
- You have keys to the office?

31:34.640 --> 31:36.130
- No, but I know the code.
- Yes.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.370
Okay. You did it again.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.285
- For the record, I am not racist.
- You're the best. Thanks.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.204
- Let's go. See you.
- Good to see you.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.284
Surprisingly helpful.
Any way I can get the watch back?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.761
Fuck out of here, Jane Fonda.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.690
That's a tough one.
And you can't fuck all three, right?

31:56.840 --> 31:58.683
- You cannot.
- Not the game. Okay.

31:58.840 --> 32:02.686
Well, then I would marry Peter,
kill Bobby, and fuck Greg.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.251
- That's what I'd do too.
- Yeah?

32:04.440 --> 32:07.171
- I think that's the only way to play it.
- It makes sense.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.930
- How'd you do?
- I did great.

32:09.080 --> 32:12.209
I got extra supplies.
I think we gotta be more careful this time.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.409
- Absolutely. So smart.
- I got a magazine to cut up the ransom note.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.289
- Can't be writing it by hand.
- Smart.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.521
<i>Bride Again Magazine?</i>

32:18.680 --> 32:22.730
To throw the cops off if they start snooping
to figure out where the letters came from.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.008
- Dora the Explorer walkie-talkies?
- Awesome.

32:25.160 --> 32:29.131
- It's not a spy store. It's a convenience store.
- Didn't wanna just use our phones?

32:29.280 --> 32:33.001
Let's use our phones. They make a record
of everything that we say and do.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.162
- Do you watch the news?
- My apologies.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.448
Hey, Obama. I'm breaking
into my old office.

32:37.640 --> 32:40.246
It's just the three of us doing this,
not us and the NSA.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.050
- I'm trying to help us out.
- Heh.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.202
- Did you get scissors?
- I got some scissors.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.967
- I don't see any latex gloves in here.
- They're, like, super expensive.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.485
- How much?
- Nine bucks a pair.

32:49.640 --> 32:50.880
- That's ridiculous.
- Right?

32:51.040 --> 32:55.090
- It's the only thing you went in there to buy.
- She's got a ton of gloves in her office.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.327
We'll just use those.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.245
You need them to get inside,
so we don't leave fingerprints.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.721
That's right. You dummy.
Don't you know that?

33:01.880 --> 33:04.645
Know what we can do?
We can use my golf gloves in my bag.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.370
He's got gloves in his golf bag.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.126
Don't poke holes in everything.
I'm trying to help out.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.360
- Guys, the team's back together.
- Ha, ha! Whoo!

33:11.440 --> 33:12.566
I call lookout.

33:12.760 --> 33:15.161
And I will let you know if I see Swiper.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.842
Nice. Let's go.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.923
How <i>we</i> doing <i>in</i> there, guys?

33:28.080 --> 33:29.445
I got it. I got it. I got it.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.602
All good. How are things out there, Nick?

33:31.760 --> 33:35.446
Things are good. Hey, can you not say
my name over the radio, please?

33:35.960 --> 33:38.964
- Why not?
- Could be somebody on the frequency.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.169
<i>Oh, yeah. It's</i> a <i>good point. Very smart.</i>

33:41.320 --> 33:43.687
<i>There you go.
That's using the old Hendricks brain.</i>

33:43.840 --> 33:45.604
And there's the last name.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.206
- We should come up with code names.
- Absolutely.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.570
- Nick, where you landing on code names?
- I'd love it if you'd stop saying my name.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.087
- Just get the gas and get out here.
- Roger that.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.448
The Blade has acquired the target.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.246
- Was that "The Blade"?
Mm-hm. That's <i>my</i> code name, <i>Nick.</i>

34:02.560 --> 34:05.325
We don't need code names.
Everybody knows who's talking.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.444
<i>They're sounding pretty cool,
so let's try to land on</i> a <i>couple.</i>

34:08.600 --> 34:11.284
<i>I'm gonna think up one real quick
and lay it on you.</i>

34:11.760 --> 34:16.288
<i>Uh, I'm coming in at you with The Majestic Lion.
I'm gonna be The Majestic Lion.</i>

34:16.440 --> 34:17.565
<i>Now we're talking.</i>

34:17.719 --> 34:19.688
Not gonna call you that.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.810
<i>That's</i> a <i>bummer there.
I'm gonna need</i> a <i>reason as to why.</i>

34:22.960 --> 34:25.929
Because you're not a jungle cat,
and it's stupid as shit.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.406
- Fair point.
- Good catch.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.244
Uh, we should come up with one for him.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.643
- How about St. <i>Nick?</i>
- You've said my name four fucking times.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.286
If you could come back out to the car,
we can go home.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.283
<i>You know what?
What if I drop the "Lion"?</i>

34:37.440 --> 34:38.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.000
- Somebody's here. Somebody's here.
<i>- Just</i> The Majestic?

34:41.120 --> 34:43.009
I love that. I like that.

34:43.159 --> 34:48.326
Shut up about the code names. A bunch of
people just pulled up into the parking lot.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.525
Hello. Get your thumb off the butt...

34:56.560 --> 34:58.289
Oh, my God.

35:00.480 --> 35:04.451
Real hot chick just pulled
into Julia's parking spot.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.408
I think Julia's headed into the building.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.404
If you'd get your thumb
off the fucking button and...

35:10.560 --> 35:12.881
Ah, fuck. Fucking idiots.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.681
Well, you know what? It's not my fault.
It's not my goddamn fault.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.645
I haven't done a thing illegal.
I can just drive out of here.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.286
I can just drive right home.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.687
No, I can't do that. I can't do that.

35:25.840 --> 35:28.127
They'll just fucking tell on me.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.966
All right, we're on our way to you.
Chickens have left the pot. My God, my God.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.281
- The coop, I think.
- What?

35:33.480 --> 35:35.562
The "my God, my God"
does sounds like a thing.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.404
Oh, shit.

35:48.720 --> 35:52.406
Why don't you set the food up over there?
And we'll circle these chairs around.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.690
Dale?

36:00.640 --> 36:02.324
Kurt.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.570
God, grant us...

36:09.720 --> 36:11.768
Oh, shit. It's a cult. It's a fucking cult.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.241
...about our sex addiction
that we cannot change...

36:14.440 --> 36:16.761
- Sex addiction.
- It's a sex addiction. Yeah.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.921
Neat.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.086
So proud of you, every one of you,
for being here today.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.611
Shit.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.611
How's it going?

36:38.760 --> 36:41.161
Hi. It's going, uh...

36:42.120 --> 36:43.281
Whew, you know.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.967
I'm in trouble.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.201
- Save it.
- Okay.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.520
...Something that happened to them
this week.

36:54.120 --> 36:57.044
Found this gentleman
loitering out in your hall.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.850
Oh, shit. Nick got busted.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.082
Says he knows he's in trouble.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.125
- Yeah.
- We're all in trouble.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.722
You don't have to be afraid.
You're safe here.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.166
Okay.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.482
Sorry I'm late. What's up, brother?

37:12.800 --> 37:16.521
Toby, why don't you grab a chair and bring
it in so this young man can join us?

37:16.680 --> 37:18.648
Yeah, um...

37:19.560 --> 37:21.847
- Boy, uh...
- What's your name, honey?

37:22.880 --> 37:25.167
I am, um...

37:29.440 --> 37:31.204
I am Blanston.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.291
- Hi, Blanston.
- Hi.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.925
For a guy not into code names...

37:36.080 --> 37:37.206
- Big swing.
- Bold choice.

37:37.400 --> 37:38.481
- And I love it.
- Yeah.

37:38.640 --> 37:43.168
- It's nice to have fresh blood in the group.
- Appreciate it.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.402
- Fresh, cute blood.
- Hey.

37:45.560 --> 37:50.248
Easy, Julia. Blanston, would you like to
share with us what's led you into recovery?

37:50.400 --> 37:56.169
Ah. Well, okay. I do
have a very big problem.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.926
Just been hitting it hard.
I've been hitting it hard.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.366
He thinks he's in an AA meeting.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.640
Getting together with the guys.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.764
Oftentimes, ending up just face down.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.130
Chugging one after the other.
Sometimes double-fisted, just:

38:12.280 --> 38:14.965
Gah, gah, gah. You know?
You know what I'm talking about.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.329
So your sexual addiction,
it's homosexual in nature?

38:18.520 --> 38:22.002
My sex addiction? My sex
addiction is, um...

38:22.160 --> 38:23.400
And then what did you say?

38:23.560 --> 38:27.963
- You like to fuck guys.
- No. My sex addiction is to ladies.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.840
- Oh.
- You know. I'm addicted to women.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.007
Boring.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.762
- Oh, fuck, I have to piss.
- What?

38:33.920 --> 38:36.161
- I have to piss. I'm nervous. I'm sorry.
- Shh.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.641
- Go, go, just pee.
- It's gonna make too much noise.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.531
No, no, just dip your dick into the toilet.

38:41.680 --> 38:44.081
- Oh, sit down and do it? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.004
- It doesn't reach.
- What?

38:47.160 --> 38:49.322
It doesn't reach. Should it reach?

38:49.480 --> 38:52.131
I mean, I don't know if it's
about "should," but...

38:52.280 --> 38:54.442
- I'll put the seat up.
- Yeah, put the seat up...

38:54.640 --> 38:56.760
- ...and just dip your butt in the bowl.
- Oh, my God.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.327
There we go.

39:00.720 --> 39:01.767
Shh! Shh! Shh!

39:01.920 --> 39:03.490
- Oh, shit, sorry.
- Shh! It's okay.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.483
- Sorry, I always flush.
- It's all right.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.165
Okay, I'm just gonna wash my hands.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.203
- No. Why are you gonna wash your hands?
- Huh?

39:09.360 --> 39:10.646
- Why?
- I always wash my hands.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.928
- You have gloves on.
- Stuff gets under there.

39:13.120 --> 39:16.806
- Fine, just be quiet. Okay, okay.
- Let me just wash them. I'll feel better.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.247
Shh.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.091
Oh, my God, Dale, stop.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.130
There's literally no element of sneak
in anything you're doing.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.240
- It's gross not to.
- I gotta go now too.

39:27.280 --> 39:29.362
- You gotta go?
- Yeah.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.690
Do you golf with the other hand...?

39:36.840 --> 39:40.481
- Don't whistle.
- I have to. The only way to get this train going.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.369
Shh, Shh, Shh!

39:48.880 --> 39:50.280
- Listen...
- Why did you flush?

39:50.360 --> 39:51.361
- It just happens.
- Why?

39:51.520 --> 39:53.841
- It's a good habit.
- Shit.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.130
Shh!

40:02.640 --> 40:04.768
- What is...?
- Shit. She's coming. Hide.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.327
But there was once, though.
There was once...

40:07.480 --> 40:12.691
Oh, boy. If this is safe in here,
I'd love to shake this out and share it.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.888
Something must've happened.
Don't fall on me.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.850
Don't worry. I took a parkour class
at the community center.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.684
Oh, he got her to go back.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.486
- Uh, I was a boy.
- How old were you?

40:22.640 --> 40:24.244
- I don't know. Young.
- Fourteen?

40:24.440 --> 40:27.444
I think we were.
Two 14-year-old boys at camp...

40:27.600 --> 40:30.410
...and not knowing what we're doing...

40:30.560 --> 40:33.370
...and just wrestling.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.609
Ooh. Wrestling camp. Fourteen.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.206
Nice.

40:38.560 --> 40:42.360
- Is he telling the truth?
- l... I don't know. But, I mean, if he is...

40:42.520 --> 40:45.205
- Good for him, right?
- Absolutely. That's great.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.523
- Did you guys wear those tight little onesies?
- Singlets?

40:48.680 --> 40:51.286
- Is that what they're called?
- That's right. Singlets.

40:51.440 --> 40:55.809
Tight little spandex offering a clear little
outline of, say, a circumcised helmet?

40:55.960 --> 40:57.689
- Oh, boy.
- Am I getting warm?

40:57.840 --> 41:00.047
Okay, uh, maybe someone else
should share.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.282
- No, no, no. Let's go to the unit.
- Sorry?

41:02.440 --> 41:06.286
What was the unit like on this little b...?
Was it veiny? Smooth?

41:06.480 --> 41:08.881
Little turtleneck? Anteater?

41:09.040 --> 41:11.168
I just... I don't know. Pretty normal.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.443
- Starter penis?
- Not the words I would've used, but...

41:14.600 --> 41:17.524
It's good to have a gay friend
in your group too, you know?

41:17.680 --> 41:19.409
- It makes us more colorful.
- Yeah.

41:19.720 --> 41:23.611
Now, did this penis ever, at any point,
find its way into your mouth?

41:23.760 --> 41:25.125
- Jesus.
- Julia, no.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.931
- You're not gonna pull this stunt again.
- What stunt?

41:28.080 --> 41:31.163
Stopping a meeting early
so she can try to flip another gay.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.641
- Really?
- She always wants what she can't have.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.842
Listen, relax, okay? He's not even gay.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.004
He had one cock at 14 and it hasn't
made its way to his mouth yet.

41:39.160 --> 41:42.323
- Well, if you'd let me finish...
- So you did eat that cock.

41:42.480 --> 41:44.721
- You're asking if I sucked it?
- I know you sucked it.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.325
I just wanna hear you say it.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.000
- Blanston, you don't have to say it.
- Shut your mouth.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.731
- Shut up and let him share. You ate it?
- Please say yes.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.530
You wanna know if I ate that dick?

41:53.680 --> 41:56.524
Did you suck that cock like a Bomb Pop
down to the blue?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.523
- You want the answer?
- Give it to me.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.604
I ate that dick, balls,
and licked that kid's sweaty asshole.

42:01.760 --> 42:04.491
Damn right you did
because you are awesomely gay.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.689
I'm super gay. Never been straight.
Know what else I've never been?

42:07.840 --> 42:09.524
- Inside a woman.
- Meeting adjourned.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.205
- Everybody out.
- Son of a bitch.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.886
Come on. Hurry it up. Hurry it up. Come on.

42:14.040 --> 42:18.011
- See you later. Bye-bye. That's it.
- Okay, Julia, you are letting the addiction win.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.084
Oh, fuck you, Roz. No one likes you anyway.

42:21.240 --> 42:22.321
Okay.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.882
- Mm. Let's get you prepped for a fill-n-drill.
- Let's do it.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.960
- Ever done it in a dentist's chair?
- I always wanted to nail my dentist.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.884
- He's a man.
<i>- I'll</i> make you forget all about him.

42:32.040 --> 42:36.045
Why don't you go get the chair ready?
I'm gonna visit the men's room real quick.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.571
Oh, you can do that on me.

42:37.720 --> 42:40.690
Oh. Uh, well, it's a...

42:41.680 --> 42:42.727
And...?

42:42.880 --> 42:46.851
Hmm. Well, uh, first time on the slopes,
so I'm gonna stay off the black diamond.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.891
Either way.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.286
- You guys are so noisy. Let's go.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.568
Congrats. I'm so proud of you
for coming out.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.127
- I'm not gay. I'll be right out, okay?
- Come on.

42:59.280 --> 43:03.251
I think it'll be a little suspicious if I disappear.
Gonna complete the diversion.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.050
- We gotta go.
- Thought you were gay.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.328
I'm not gay. Go on, go on.
I'll be right out.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.927
Oh. I get it. You're bi.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.491
I'm not bi.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.880
Not bi?

43:13.560 --> 43:16.882
- Do you have, uh, an S? I need an S.
- S, yes.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.760
- How's that?
- Uh, do you have a scarier S than that?

43:19.920 --> 43:23.447
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, here.
This is from an article about bridezillas.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.968
Yeah, that'll do it.
Okay, can I read you what I got right now?

43:27.160 --> 43:29.242
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.243
"Give us the $500,000..

43:31.400 --> 43:32.925
...or the little boy dies.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.642
You have 24 hours."

43:38.000 --> 43:40.765
I wish you were there to read it.
Sounds scary in that voice.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.490
That's why I wanted scary letters.

43:42.680 --> 43:45.251
Hopefully he's hearing a voice
like that when he reads.

43:45.400 --> 43:49.610
- But why "little boy"? Makes him sound 6.
- Don't wanna be like, "Or the grown man dies."

43:49.760 --> 43:52.127
- You're right. No, absolutely.
- It's not even...

43:52.280 --> 43:55.489
- All right, glue stick, and I'm gonna lock this in.
- Oh, great, yeah.

43:55.640 --> 43:58.405
- First draft, final draft, right?
- How about that? Nice job.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.971
God, I tell you what.

44:00.160 --> 44:04.449
I hope this doesn't sound cocky.
I think we're really good at this.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.840
We're extremely good at it.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.766
I didn't wanna say anything,
but way better than murder.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.121
- A lot better than murder.
- We found our groove.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.640
- This is fun.
- It is kind of fun.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.280
- Nobody gets hurt.
- I always wanted to make a ransom note.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.289
- All here. Let's go.
- Ah!

44:18.440 --> 44:21.603
Son of a bitch. I knew I should've been
gluing them as I went along.

44:21.800 --> 44:22.961
- Ah.
- Oy, oy, oy.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.930
Hey. Hey. Talk to me. How was it?

44:26.080 --> 44:28.367
It was like something
I've just never encountered.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.607
What, uh, a woman?

44:30.960 --> 44:34.203
I mean, she's so free.
She's so eloquent with her body.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.011
I mean, all of that sexual energy...

44:37.160 --> 44:40.926
...it flows from this place
of deep tenderness, you know?

44:41.080 --> 44:44.971
- It's called her vagina, Nick.
- Please don't talk like that. Come on, let's go.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.685
Listen. He's being so protective.

44:46.840 --> 44:50.765
You're talking like you fell in love with her.
What, are you in love with her, Nick?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.047
No, Dale.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.488
- That was a real long pause right there.
- That was a moment of silence.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.400
I'm not in love with her.
That's ridiculous.

44:58.520 --> 45:01.842
She gave me a very rich
and positive experience.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.162
Oh, yeah? Better than wrestling camp?

45:13.640 --> 45:15.961
Oh, boy. Nice house.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.487
Well, he's doing well.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.766
Good for him.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.526
- All right, let's discuss our options.
- Breathe, and go.

45:22.680 --> 45:26.571
Hey, whoa. Guys, you can't just park
right in front of the guy's house.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.166
You wanna carry an unconscious dude
down the street?

45:29.320 --> 45:31.163
He's gonna be way too heavy.
Let's move.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.890
That's a good point. Good point.

45:34.120 --> 45:36.964
Wait, whoa. You can't just walk up
to the guy's front door.

45:37.120 --> 45:40.124
- Will you calm down? We have a plan.
- We have a plan. Just relax.

45:40.280 --> 45:44.001
Oh, do you? That's great.
That makes me feel a lot better.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.363
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.284
Watch this. Go.

45:48.840 --> 45:50.126
- Ah, fuck.
- Fuck.

45:50.280 --> 45:51.850
- It's a bust.
- It's locked.

45:53.080 --> 45:57.210
- The plan did not account for a locked door?
- Fifty-fifty chance it's gonna be open.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.441
- How do you figure that?
- Either locked or unlocked.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.683
- Fifty-fifty, yeah.
- It's basic math. What's up with you tonight?

46:03.840 --> 46:05.524
- Give me your credit card.
- Good.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.682
- Plan B's got a credit card in it?
- Come on.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.490
- Your plan sucks.
- Your math sucks.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.721
That's what's going on.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.882
- Wait. What if he's in there?
- Oh, yeah.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.560
- How do we make sure?
- Why don't you ring the doorbell?

46:15.720 --> 46:17.370
- I love it. Smart.
- Don't. Kurt.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.567
Oh, shit. Are you kidding?

46:21.240 --> 46:23.680
- It's dark. Don't think anybody's here.
- Don't hit it again.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.524
- You hear that?
- I know that song.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.600
- What is that?
- It's a song, right? Is it:

46:29.720 --> 46:31.324
<i>No matter what you do</i>

46:31.480 --> 46:32.686
No, no.

46:32.840 --> 46:34.046
<i>I will always be with you</i>

46:34.200 --> 46:35.565
- Who sings that?
- Badfinger.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.245
<i>Doesn't matter what you do, girl</i>

46:37.400 --> 46:38.526
Quiet.

46:38.680 --> 46:40.842
<i>Ooh, girl, with you</i>

46:41.000 --> 46:42.161
You nailed it.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.566
<i>Knock down the old gray wall</i>

46:43.720 --> 46:45.006
Shut the fuck up.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.120
- Hey, you're yelling.
- Shh! Shh! You're yelling.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.725
Do me a favor. Hurry up.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.407
Fail to open up the front door
so we can get the fuck out of here.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.601
- Ah, fuck.
- Ooh.

46:54.760 --> 46:57.206
- What's "fuck"? What happened?
- We got a problem.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.442
- Yeah, see? Right there?
- Goddamn it.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.967
- There it is. Staring back at us.
- Okay, what now?

47:02.120 --> 47:04.566
I guess we follow your idea
and we get out of here.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.291
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- No. Hey. My credit card's in there.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.728
- Call them and cancel.
- They'll send you a new one overnight.

47:10.880 --> 47:14.123
When they find the card, they'll know
we were here. It's pretty simple.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.442
- Oh, shit.
- They're gonna know you were here.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.968
Go, go. Car. Car.

47:28.680 --> 47:31.809
What do you got going there?
- Finger-flage.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.610
Is that his wife?

47:34.760 --> 47:37.286
No, that's a '93 Civic
and she's carrying dry cleaning.

47:37.440 --> 47:38.601
I'm gonna go with a maid.

47:38.760 --> 47:41.161
He married his maid?

47:48.760 --> 47:51.491
Mr. Rex, are you home?

47:52.120 --> 47:54.282
It me, Kim Song.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.729
I pick up your dry cleaning.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.090
- Okay, I got it.
- Wow.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.971
He's got good taste.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.526
It's bent, goddamn it.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.650
- Nice, clean lines, little pops of color.
- Let's go.

48:17.800 --> 48:18.801
- Go?
- What?

48:18.960 --> 48:20.610
We just got inside. Let's stay.

48:20.760 --> 48:24.003
- So did she. Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Are you quitting on the plan?

48:26.520 --> 48:28.488
- Back in. Back in. He's here.
- Why? Who's here?

48:28.640 --> 48:31.405
- Mr. Rex.
- Oh, shit.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.486
Kim? You here?

48:39.200 --> 48:40.326
Kim, you grab my shirts?

48:40.520 --> 48:43.126
- Yes, Mr. Rex. I go hang up now.
- Great.

48:43.480 --> 48:45.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kim. Kimbo.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.924
- Take a look at this. Tell me what you see.
- Uh...

48:49.080 --> 48:51.890
Are you gonna leave this mess
in the bottom of my sink?

48:52.520 --> 48:53.851
The water?

48:54.000 --> 48:57.402
Yes, the little water droplets
all over the bottom of my sink.

48:57.560 --> 49:00.769
I don't know what thatched hut
you grew up in, but this is disgusting.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.763
But it just water.

49:02.920 --> 49:05.287
Okay. Okay.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.204
Then you just fire.

49:08.520 --> 49:11.171
You lose your job. Too bad for you.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.368
Bye-bye.

49:15.680 --> 49:19.127
Ha, ha! Look at you. I got you again.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.642
Look at that little chubby face.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.610
You think I was gonna fire you
on your fucking birthday?

49:24.760 --> 49:27.764
Are you out of your mind, Mrs. Miyagi?
Get over here.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.128
Come here, you. Happy birthday.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.606
I got you something.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.560
That's a good one.

49:40.720 --> 49:43.644
That's top of the line.
That's like the Cadillac of plungers.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.884
That's just for here, though, okay?

49:46.080 --> 49:47.570
- No taking it home.
- No.

49:47.720 --> 49:49.643
Yeah, what's up, man?

49:49.840 --> 49:54.926
Yeah, no, I'm not busy at all. I'm just
making my maid's day. It's her birthday.

49:55.600 --> 49:59.047
Hey, Kim, seriously, though.
Can we keep a dry sink from here on in?

49:59.200 --> 50:00.486
Yes, Mr. Rex.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.606
What's up?

50:02.760 --> 50:04.250
No, fuck that, man.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.004
Kim.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.411
Oh.

50:51.200 --> 50:54.249
Dude, I'm trying.
My dad is being a total dick about the money.

50:54.720 --> 50:55.767
What's she doing?

50:57.600 --> 50:59.967
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What is she doing?

51:00.160 --> 51:02.322
- Kurt. Kurt. Kurt.
- What? What? What?

51:02.480 --> 51:04.801
Oh, shit. That's my thing.
She's doing my thing.

51:04.960 --> 51:08.442
- I can't believe she's fucking doing that.
- She's not going in deep enough.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.407
- Do you think she's just cleaning?
- What a rookie.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.007
Okay, there she goes. Okay. All right.

51:14.880 --> 51:16.928
Kimchi.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.650
- There he is.
- Okay. Shh.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.128
- Oh, no. He's gonna brush his teeth.
- He is.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.009
- He's gonna do it.
- Here he goes.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.764
- Do it.
- Do it.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.321
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:31.960 --> 51:34.440
Yeah, get them nice and clean,
you son of a bitch.

51:34.600 --> 51:35.840
So satisfying.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.800
Wait, guys. Okay. Now what, though?
What are we doing? What do we do now?

51:39.960 --> 51:42.960
We wait for him to go to bed.
Dale starts the gas. I've got the ransom note.

51:44.320 --> 51:46.040
- Not now.
- He said, "Dale, start the gas."

51:46.120 --> 51:47.320
I said, "Dale starts the gas."

51:47.440 --> 51:50.284
Later, you idiot. Turn that off.
We can't have the gas in here.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.726
Okay. I'll put this on the...

51:51.920 --> 51:54.526
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying to. It's broken or something.

51:54.680 --> 51:56.682
Are you kidding me? Turn it the other way.

51:56.880 --> 52:00.123
We dropped it like a million times.
I think we broke it. No, see?

52:00.280 --> 52:02.169
- It's not doing anything.
- Let's get out.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.049
- What? He's right outside.
- Shh.

52:04.200 --> 52:06.282
Shit. He's right there.
Then get the can out of here.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.523
Don't start laughing.
What is funny about this?

52:09.680 --> 52:11.400
Look at your face. Look at his face.
Ha, ha.

52:11.560 --> 52:12.800
- Oh, no.
- Dude, your face...

52:12.960 --> 52:15.008
The gas. Is this the gas?

52:15.160 --> 52:17.606
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.922
Hey. Listen. Keep it together.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.127
Yes, it's the gas.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.728
- It's pretty good.
- You keep it together.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.204
I was trying to hit him.

52:29.760 --> 52:32.889
- Guys.
- No, no, no.

52:33.080 --> 52:35.731
Okay. I'm good. I'm good. Let's...

52:49.600 --> 52:52.922
Shit. Kurt. Kurt, your phone.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.491
Your phone. Answer your phone.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.802
- I got it. I got it. I got it.
- Where are we?

52:56.960 --> 52:59.611
- Shut it off.
- Why is your wife calling me?

52:59.760 --> 53:03.685
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's probably freaking out.
I didn't come home last night.

53:03.840 --> 53:04.887
Quiet.

53:05.040 --> 53:07.327
Dude, get your fucking head
out of my crotch.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.763
Will you look at this fucking view
during the daytime? You kidding me?

53:16.960 --> 53:18.371
- He seems gone.
- Unbelievable.

53:18.520 --> 53:20.363
- Bed's made.
- I can't believe this.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.806
We should maybe just check.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.166
- Hey! Rex!
- Hey.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.766
Rex! Rex!

53:25.920 --> 53:27.649
Dale.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.487
Did you have a plan if he responded?

53:31.360 --> 53:35.001
- I didn't think that far ahead.
- You get even dumber in the mornings.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.650
- Why are you worried?
- Let's go.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.371
- You know, fifty-fifty chance he was here.
- Yeah.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.969
You know, Stacy's just gonna
completely flip out when I get home.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.691
- What kind of dad doesn't come home?
- Shut that down.

53:45.840 --> 53:49.640
If the worst thing that happens from this
clusterfuck is your domestic problems...

53:49.800 --> 53:53.327
...we can consider ourselves lucky.
We just dodged a huge bullet back there.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.006
We almost made
the worst decision of our lives.

53:56.160 --> 54:00.484
That's true. Know why? If he opens that closet
and sees us, we're in prison right now.

54:00.640 --> 54:05.009
That's right. So we're very, very lucky.
What the fuck is the matter with us?

54:05.160 --> 54:09.085
I tell you what. If a couple tiny things
went our way, we could've pulled that off.

54:09.240 --> 54:12.403
We're not criminals. We suck at crime.
We're nice, normal guys.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.206
- I like baseball. I wear pants.
- Yup.

54:15.360 --> 54:17.886
- Back to being cogs in the machine.
- Cogs. Cogs, dude.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.166
Cogs are good.

54:19.640 --> 54:20.846
It's a relief, you know?

54:21.000 --> 54:24.004
It's like a weight lifted off your...
What is it, shoulders?

54:24.160 --> 54:27.323
- It's a fresh start where everything's...
<i>- I'll</i> call you guys later.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.609
- Please don't kill me.
- Fuck!

54:29.760 --> 54:31.569
- Oh, fuck.
- What the fuck is that?

54:31.720 --> 54:36.089
What the fuck is that? What did we do?
We kidnap him while we're high on nitrous?

54:36.240 --> 54:38.481
Then went back into the closet
and went to sleep?

54:38.640 --> 54:40.404
- Why would we do that?
- Shh. Shh. What?

54:41.880 --> 54:43.405
Is he crying?

54:47.600 --> 54:50.729
Oh, my God. The best.

54:51.280 --> 54:54.204
That was so good.

54:54.560 --> 54:55.925
Help me out.

54:58.080 --> 55:01.562
The look on your... Look at this.

55:05.680 --> 55:09.207
I really couldn’t... Your fucking face.

55:09.560 --> 55:13.326
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, man. Yeah. Whoo-whee.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.084
Ah! You had us.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.811
Oh! Oh!

55:20.400 --> 55:21.890
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

55:22.040 --> 55:24.168
- What's happening?
- Oh, boy.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.769
Oh, my God, you guys. Thank you.

55:31.200 --> 55:34.249
I have not laughed like
that in a long time.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.006
Oh, my God. Goddamn, that was great.
Food for the soul.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.208
Good, well, we were just
trying to be funny.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.886
- You know, no harm, no foul, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.849
Guys, I completely underestimated you.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.641
You fuckers have some low-hanging balls.
I mean it. I'm impressed.

55:48.320 --> 55:50.641
I mean, I wake up,
I find you three in my closet...

55:50.800 --> 55:53.485
...along with a ransom note,
a big old bottle of nitrous.

55:53.640 --> 55:57.122
I'm like, "Holy shit.
These fuckers were gonna gas me."

55:57.280 --> 55:59.851
I'm about to call the cops when I think,
"Hold up a sec.

56:00.040 --> 56:02.008
These guys may be onto something."

56:03.160 --> 56:05.162
I wanna partner up on this thing.

56:05.320 --> 56:08.529
- What thing? What are you talking about?
- I'm not sure what you mean.

56:08.680 --> 56:11.001
- This thing. My kidnapping.
- Oh.

56:11.320 --> 56:14.164
Truth be told, Pop and I...

56:14.520 --> 56:17.922
...we've hit a rough patch.
He's refusing to cover some of my expenses.

56:18.080 --> 56:22.165
Long story. Anyway, your timing could not
have been better. Is this a fucking marlin?

56:22.320 --> 56:25.688
Rex, this is, uh, cool and all,
but we decided, like, we're out.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.649
- We're not doing crime.
- Not our thing.

56:27.800 --> 56:30.770
Yeah, no, he's right.
No, the kidnapping is off, actually.

56:30.920 --> 56:33.082
- Huh? No, no, no, it's on.
- No, it's off.

56:33.280 --> 56:35.760
No, it's totally on.
I sent the ransom note to my dad.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.285
- You what?
- You did what?

56:37.440 --> 56:40.762
It's brilliant. Who came up with
that thing about me being a little boy?

56:41.360 --> 56:43.124
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

56:43.280 --> 56:47.001
I was a little insulted you only asked for
$500,000 for me. Is that all I'm worth? Hmm?

56:47.640 --> 56:49.961
No sweat. I tacked on another zero.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.290
- Five-hundred million?
- Wow, that's a ton.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.284
- Five million, guys.
- Five million.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.965
- Five million.
- Five. Right.

56:57.120 --> 57:01.284
Yeah, 5 million. One million dollars
for you guys, and 4 for me.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.044
Why don't we make that ransom call?

57:03.360 --> 57:04.930
Yeah, Rex, let's not.

57:05.080 --> 57:10.211
We appreciate the offer, and thank you for
not calling the cops, but we're gonna pass.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.447
- No.
- Yeah.

57:11.600 --> 57:14.365
Guys. Guys, how's this anything
but great news?

57:14.520 --> 57:18.650
All I'm asking you to do is finish your
own plan but for double the money.

57:18.800 --> 57:21.963
Plus, it got a thousand times easier
because now I'm your inside man.

57:22.160 --> 57:23.650
I can make sure Dad pays up.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.484
And then when you, uh, "set me free"...

57:25.640 --> 57:28.610
...I tell the cops it was three
other morons that went that way.

57:28.760 --> 57:31.240
Oh. Wow.
That's not the worst idea I've ever heard.

57:31.400 --> 57:33.767
- It's better than our original idea.
- A lot better.

57:33.920 --> 57:35.410
Give us one second.

57:35.560 --> 57:36.607
Fucking what?

57:36.800 --> 57:39.326
- We can't trust this guy.
- You can trust me.

57:39.480 --> 57:43.166
No, you're right. They burned us once already.
We're not gonna get burned again.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.527
- Nice try.
- Thanks but no thanks.

57:45.680 --> 57:48.809
- That's a Nick-Kurt-Dale no from us.
- Nick, Kurt and Dale.

57:48.960 --> 57:51.930
- So, uh, thank you, but adios.
- Yeah. Heh.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.650
- Okay.
- You need a ride?

57:53.800 --> 57:55.928
No. I think I'll hang out here.

57:56.080 --> 57:58.526
You know, escape from your clutches...

57:58.680 --> 58:00.330
...and call the police.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.687
Go ahead. Call them.
We never kidnapped you.

58:02.840 --> 58:04.330
- Yeah, you did.
- We didn't.

58:04.480 --> 58:06.289
- Yeah, you abducted me.
- We did not.

58:06.440 --> 58:08.124
Yeah, you brought me back here.

58:08.280 --> 58:11.204
- There was a struggle.
- Oh, shit. Come on, man.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.010
Things got broken.

58:13.600 --> 58:14.647
What the...?

58:15.440 --> 58:17.363
And then, you assaulted me.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.045
- Oh, shit.
- What?

58:19.200 --> 58:20.645
This guy's fucking nuts.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.564
Hey, Rex? It's off, pal.

58:22.720 --> 58:26.167
Oh, and then you beat me. Mercilessly.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.890
Holy shit. He's Fight Clubbing himself.
We got a Fight Clubber.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.964
And then I found my way up here
and I found this phone.

58:34.640 --> 58:36.529
- I picked up the receiver...
- Oh, no.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.011
...and I dialed 9...

58:38.200 --> 58:40.407
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Come on. Joke's over.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.562
- ...1...
- Don't you hit the second 1.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.080
- Don't do it. Aah!
- Don't hit it.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.923
I don't know where I'm going.
I don't know where you find pay phones.

58:50.080 --> 58:52.367
- There's some pay phones at the park here.
- Okay.

58:52.520 --> 58:56.570
Boys, we are doing this.
The adventure begins. Who's fired up?

58:56.920 --> 58:58.206
Hmm.

58:58.760 --> 59:02.162
Such a negative energy.
This is killing me. Guys, come on.

59:02.320 --> 59:06.166
- Can you scoot over just a smidge?
- Huh? No, I sit in the middle.

59:06.320 --> 59:08.288
- That's his seat.
- It's a whole thing, Rex.

59:08.480 --> 59:11.245
- I know. Just you're crowding me.
- I'm crowding this guy now?

59:11.440 --> 59:13.480
He's forcing us to kidnap him,
and I'm crowding him?

59:13.600 --> 59:17.650
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. Simmer down.
Kidnapping was your idea, remember?

59:17.800 --> 59:20.371
- But then we had the idea to not do it.
- Yeah, exactly.

59:20.520 --> 59:22.249
- I sit in the middle!
- Hey, hey.

59:22.400 --> 59:24.926
- Dale, just do what he says.
- Ah, for chrissake.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.691
Oh, God. That is nice.

59:28.240 --> 59:29.765
This is way better.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.963
This is bullshit, by the way.

59:38.880 --> 59:43.488
Excuse me, Dr. Harris.
Was someone in the office last night?

59:43.680 --> 59:46.570
Uh, my sex-addiction group met here at 8.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.645
Oh. Yes. But, doctor,
the keypad logged an earlier entrance.

59:50.800 --> 59:52.131
Really?

59:52.480 --> 59:54.289
Let's check our fancy new camera system.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.691
That's a gay guy. It's so weird.
He didn't bone me like a gay guy.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.491
He only cried, like, a little bit.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.883
And he was oddly squeamish
about his own asshole, which is weird.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.811
- It's so weird.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.526
Is that Dale?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.331
What's he doing with Kurt and Blanston?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.289
- Should we call the police?
- No.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.846
No.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.850
I'll take care of them.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.251
<i>Enjoy.</i>

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.450
It's good stuff. Learn something.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.326
All right, it's ringing.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.003
Remember, you guys hold all the cards.
Game faces. You are going to crush this.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.084
Hold on. He knows what we sound like.
We gotta use an accent.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.285
- No accents. That's ridiculous.
- That's a great idea, Kurty.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.847
Boulder Stream.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.241
- Who is this? The secretary?
- Accent. Yeah.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.688
Hey, homey.
Let me speak to Mr. Bert Hanson.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.487
No, I don't mind holding. I just barely
even called you right now already.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.642
- That's incredibly racist.
- Super racist.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.046
Just do a Southern accent.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.521
Southern? Southern I got.
Southern. No problem.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.201
Hanson.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.488
Well, howdy there, partner.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.650
Uh, this here's the gents
what got your young'un and all.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.371
<i>And, well, we got some talking to do</i> and...

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.450
- Southern, not old prospector.
- I thought that was pretty good.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.322
Listen, you lowlife bottom-feeder,
I don't have time for this little fuck-around.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.689
<i>Either this ends right now,
or it ends with bullets in your skulls.</i>

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.242
Now, you hush.
You don't scare us one bit. We got your boy.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.883
<i>- I bet that tears you up something fierce.
- How do</i> I <i>know you</i> really <i>have my boy?</i>

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.567
Dad.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.930
<i>Dad, is that you? Please. They're crazy.</i>

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.447
They told me if you call the police,
they'd kill me.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.524
Please. Please, do whatever
they say. I don't wanna die, Dad.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.484
No police. Aah!

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.967
- God!
- Rex? Rex? Where are you?

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.930
Now, you listen.
Y'all gonna have to rassle up...

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.004
...that 5 million bucks in cash.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.730
<i>We're looking at all 100s.</i>

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.927
- Unmarked.
- Unmarked.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.924
- No tracers.
- No tracers and no dye packs neither.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.606
Otherwise, we gonna take your boy...

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.242
...and string him up by
his pretty little neck...

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.849
...with the roughest,
coarsest piece of rope we got...

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.361
...in our rope inventory.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.444
<i>You understand?
You got 24 hours before he dead.</i>

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.246
- Yes.
- That is how it's done.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.481
Let's go. All right.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.446
Guys, that was great.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.126
That was so much fun.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.964
- Absolutely.
- You were incredible.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.771
- Thanks for getting us snacks, dude.
- You earned it.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.251
So now what? What do we do?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.447
- Okay.
- What's the plan?

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.847
- I say we go back to the office.
Mm-hm.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.570
Okay? Lay low for a little while.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.688
And we wait for that
money train to roll in.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.730
- Choo-choo!
- Choo-choo, baby!

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.251
- Oh! Turn up this song. I love this one.
- We're doing this thing.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.485
I hate to break up the car party, but, Rex,
you don't have a plan for the ransom drop...

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.520
...and that is the part
where people get caught.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.123
Wow. The ransom drop is only hard
if the police are involved.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.251
Yeah. But what if he does call the police?
Because that wouldn't be good.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.246
He's a billionaire.
He's not gonna risk my life over $5 million.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.882
After Kurt's little performance,
there's no way he's gonna call the cops.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.850
My performance? What about yours?
You were so in the moment.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.082
- You think so?
- You were great! And you were!

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.402
Get your mouths off his dick, okay?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.080
- Everyone was doing pretty good.
- Whoa. Take it down a notch.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.163
Wait. Shut up, shut up, shut up.
This is Stacy.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.522
Oh, my God. I forgot to call her.
Uh, hi, honey.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.445
- Where have you been all night?
- Here's <i>what</i> happened.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.409
I fell asleep at the office, and...

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.609
Really? Because Find My iPhone
said you weren't at the office.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.683
Heh. What, are you cheating on me, Dale?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.524
- Look, you're upset and...
- Oh, shit.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.524
- Oh, God. Goddamn it.
- He called the cops.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.650
- Oh, we're busted.
- Busted? Oh, my God.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.365
- I'm not busted.
- Drive.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.807
No one is busted in
a bad sense of the word.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.043
- Too late. Lupe's got us. Pull in.
- Put your head in my lap.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.285
Honey, no one's head's going in my lap. It's
something guys are saying now. I can't talk.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.169
- Hide, hide, hide.
- I am fucked.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.482
- Let's just go in. Be calm and be cool.
- Shit.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.608
- Hi.
- Gentlemen.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.001
- You own this establishment?
- This place here?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.845
I don't know. Do you really
own anything in this lifetime?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.243
- We're currently renting.
- It's all just material. Electrons, protons.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.731
- Yeah. We do.
- Technically.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.728
Let me ask you, has your company done
business recently with a Mr. Bert Hanson?

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.524
- Barb Fanson? Doesn't ring a bell.
- Not really ringing a bell.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.682
- I don't think that we have.
- Not our guy.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.724
That's interesting.
The way I hear it, you're working with him.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.764
And things didn't shake out
too well for you boys.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.206
- Oh, Bert.
- Oh. Bert Hanson.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.691
- Yeah.
- Is that what he said?

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.081
- Bert Hanson? Oh, yeah. We know him.
- That guy.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.810
We had a business disagreement.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.610
- Big whoop.
- No big deal.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.843
- Water under the bridge.
- We're super friendly with the guy.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.001
You're very forgiving.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.448
Because almost everyone I've talked to
thinks he's an asshole.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.409
- Do they think that?
- I could see that.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.642
Strong word. I don't know if I'd use it.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.247
We like the guy. Definitely don't think
his son deserves to be kidnapped.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.970
Kidnapped?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.322
Who said anything about kidnapping?

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.241
Uh...

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.200
- I wanna say you did.
- I didn't.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.410
- I heard you say it.
- I didn't.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.324
- I feel like you did.
- I'm sure I did.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.051
You said "kidnapping."
I was like, "What a weird word."

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.488
- Should be more "kidnabbing."
- No, I did not. Did I say that?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.169
- I think you might have, sir.
- You sure?

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.649
Well, I got a little lost with
all their yammering, but pretty sure.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.001
All right, maybe I did.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.128
- Hey.
- It's been a long week.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.567
We'll be in touch.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.486
Yeah. Anytime you want. Don't worry, because
the main thing is that you said it...

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.005
Stop talking. Stop talking.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.680
You've done plenty, plenty of talking.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.810
Where you going? Come back here.
Come over here. We're going this way.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.524
I don't want you to thank me.
Just go home and enjoy your family.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.331
Enjoy the rest of the day off, everyone.
You've earned it.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.121
Ah. Ugh.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.889
The police were just checking.
Making sure we're locking up at night.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.169
You know, they're keeping
the neighborhood safe. They're heroes.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.005
- Okay, all taken care of.
- Shh.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.889
- No, everyone's gone.
- No, no, he...

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.280
He's spinning out.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.041
I was really clear my life was in danger.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.848
He called the police anyway.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.282
Yeah, and since he did...

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.001
...it's pretty clear that we're not gonna
be able to continue with the scam...

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.965
Five million dollars is nothing to him.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.088
But I guess it's worth more to him
than my life.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.480
- Ooh.
- Aw.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.530
- I'm his son, for chrissake.
- Oh, boy. We got a crier.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.242
- Look how blue his eyes get when he's crying.
- I'm sorry. This is so fucking embarrassing.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.731
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- No.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.848
Toilet paper here. You can blow your nose.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.925
Just because your dad called the cops
doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.766
No, of course not. Oh, my gosh.
I'm sure it was just his first reaction.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.685
- He's scared, confused.
- It's natural. I mean, Dale's a dad.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.046
I'm a dad.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.168
Can you imagine if someone stole
one of them?

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.328
- I can't imagine.
- You would call the cops.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.211
No, I don't think I'd call the cops.
I couldn't take that risk.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.241
- Different situation.
- Shit, I'm sorry.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.561
Bad example.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.643
Maybe some alone time would be helpful.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.882
Why don't we step outside,
give him a minute?

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.208
We'll come back, don't do anything rash.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.409
- Get the loose rope. I don't want him to...
- We can only hope.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.289
Can I talk to you outside, please?

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.211
- Oh, boy.
- Man, I feel terrible for that guy.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.204
I know. Are you kidding me?
Poor, poor guy.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.523
- I mean, that is rough. Rough.
- Are you guys shitting me in there?

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.451
His dad sold him out for...
It was probably nothing to him.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.130
- Pennies to him.
- The guy's rich.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.284
That would rock me to my core.
Have a little empathy. Please?

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.451
Know what's going on? You're holding a
grudge right now. Yes, you do that.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.171
- You get all tight. You're gonna get cancer.
- You do.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.761
- I don't want that.
- Let the past be the past.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.448
We're not in the fucking past. We're in
the goddamn present. And you guys...

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.082
What are you talking about? You're acting
like you have Stockholm Syndrome.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.241
What is that?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.561
- What, like jet lag?
- No.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.563
- Do I look tired to you?
- You don't. No.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.245
- You don't look tired.
- I'm fine.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.880
Stockholm Syndrome's when
you bond with your captors.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.771
Oh, okay. Well, then hold on a second.
He's the hostage.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.161
So this would be reverse
Stockholm Syndrome.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.921
Yeah, and we don't have that, okay?

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.721
He's just a really, really, really likable guy.
I like him a lot.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.803
- He's really likable.
- The guy's a winner.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.530
It's nice to be around a winner.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.366
- Oh, boy. It feels right, Nick. Come on.
- Here's what we're gonna do.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.490
We're gonna go in,
tell him cops were never part of this plan...

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.246
...and the shit ends now. Let's do it.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:27.966
- Okay, but hear us out about festering.
- Like you can't have a conversation.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.687
It was a wonderful idea. Didn't work out.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.571
So I think the best thing to do
is just to pull the plug...

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.247
...and you tell the police that the guys
who got you chickened out...

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:40.129
...let you go, they're long gone.

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:44.205
- They didn't all chicken out.
- Now's not the time to back off, boys.

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.603
I say we chop off a toe,
mail it to him and double the ransom.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.331
- Now you're talking. Chop, chop, chop.
- Yes! Wait, whose toe?

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.807
- Not it. Not it. Not my toe.
- No one's toe.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.962
Keep your toes. Time to call it off.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.804
Nick. Nick. Come on.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.962
- Nick, look at me.
- Oy.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.928
Look, man, if we give up now,
I'll be just fine, you know?

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.127
But you guys, your employees,
for God's sake.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.322
- Dale's little boys.
- Girls, Kurt.

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:08.926
- Hey, thanks. Yes.
- Yeah. You're all fucked.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.524
- Nick, come on.
- Come on.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.569
You can't roll over and die
when your back's against the wall.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.961
- Don't roll over and die.
- You gotta be careful.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.009
- You have to take what's yours.
- Take it!

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.209
Put your name on it. Write your name on it
and say, "That's mine."

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.486
And take it.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.404
I think I'll take it from here, okay?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.688
- He's got it.
- He's got it. Listen right here.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.127
- This is where you want it to come from.
- Not us.

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:31.680
- I got it!
- Sorry, Rex. Sorry.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.683
- He's got it.
- Come on, man.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.807
Help me help you get revenge
on my asshole dad...

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.850
...and get you paid a million bucks cash.
- Yes.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.050
Boy, it sounds awesome,
but there's no way to get it done.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.685
That's not true. How about this?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.002
How about if we just put our heads together?
We brainstorm a little.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.410
If we don't come up with a ransom plan
that you love, we pull the plug.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.801
- Then you'd let us walk?
- You have my word.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.130
But if we do come up
with something really inspired...

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.282
...then we're in it to win it.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.527
Well, I can't stop anybody
from brainstorming.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.051
You're the best.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.441
- All right.
<i>- I'll</i> see you upstairs, man.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.361
Is "vagina" with a G or a J?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.641
All right.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.683
Let's run it down from the top.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.362
Okay. First we tie up Rex in one
of those abandoned warehouses off 3rd.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.121
Then we call Bert on a dark phone.
It's prepaid and untraceable.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.529
Go to the bench on the 4th Street Bridge
to make the drop.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.569
Not long enough to trace the call.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.643
Goddamn it.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.849
These guys are pros.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.207
I want a tracer put in that bag.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.882
The police are sending everyone they've got
to watch the bridge.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.491
Weapons tight. Eyes on.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.211
<i>All right, tactical command, red team.</i>

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.010
Here we go.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.445
<i>But when he gets there...</i>

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.840
...he finds the dark phone
that I planted ahead of time.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.167
<i>Then we call him from the second dark
phone, and tell him to proceed downtown.</i>

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.441
Hello.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:34.681
You'll wanna pull into the garage under
the Mandrake Hotel and park in Space 4421.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.330
<i>There, you will find a red bag.</i>

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.769
<i>You will transfer the money into this bag, then
drive out and await the location of the drop.</i>

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.129
And we tell him if anyone follows him in,
his son's a fucking corpse.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.808
<i>And when Bert
drives that far underground...</i>

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.247
<i>...the police will lose
the signal from his wire.</i>

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.163
<i>But when he arrives,
instead of finding a bag he finds you three.</i>

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.527
<i>Disguised. Armed. Dangerous.</i>

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.685
- Yeah, but the gun's not loaded, right?
- Of course not. Nobody gets hurt, come on.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.766
I then tell him to give
me his jacket and tie.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.526
So just as the cops are
starting to sweat...

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.729
<i>...Dad pulls out with the new red bag,
just as he was instructed.</i>

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.730
- Sir, we have the signal back.
- Thank God.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.286
<i>Only it won't be my father driving.
It'll be our ringer.</i>

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.441
- We're back on him, sir.
- How do you know it's him?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.361
<i>I still have the cash
and I'm heading to the drop.</i>

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.006
I guess it's him. Stay with him.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.208
<i>So I drive to the Staples Center.</i>

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.523
<i>Kings have Vancouver. Great matchup.
Place will be packed.</i>

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.722
<i>Cops will stay with the money,
wait for the kidnappers to receive the drop.</i>

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.201
Hanson made the drop, stay on the money.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.727
We got our man. Take him down.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.446
Stay down.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.562
Son of a bitch.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.242
<i>By the time the cops know
they've been had...</i>

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.529
<i>...Kurt's a ghost.</i>

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.130
<i>And Nick and Dale disappear with the cash.</i>

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.363
<i>And, finally, I am rescued
from my hellish captivity.</i>

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.170
Thank you. Where's my dad?

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.800
Dad!

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.521
<i>A week later, once the smoke clears,
we'll be sitting poolside, splitting up the cash.</i>

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.362
It's raining. Who wants it?
There's enough to share.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.562
Look what came. Who wants some tequila?

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.921
- It's cash.
- Thanks, babe.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.127
Hey, whoa, Dale.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.841
Get your goddamn kids out of the fantasy.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.128
Let them enjoy the pool,
let me enjoy the money.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.363
- They're not even allowed at this pool.
- I can't turn my mind off.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.240
- Guys. Guys. Guys.
- Will you stop it?

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:14.002
Come on. Let's not argue, okay?
We came up with an awesome plan.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.162
It is smart. It is mad creative.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.806
You know, you boys continue to impress me.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.844
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, man.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.321
- You came up with most of it, though.
- I did not.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.608
- You did.
- That is a lie. It was a team effort.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.445
You came up with going into the garage,
losing the signal.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.649
That was brilliant. Kurty came up
with the dark-phone business.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.849
- That's from "Grand Theft Auto." I took it.
- Genius. Dale, uh...

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.846
I had the thing where you go on the zip
line to the trampoline to the skateboard.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.368
- Nick shot that down, if you remember.
- Yeah. It wasn't a good idea.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.090
It was a bad idea, it really was.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.881
You had a lot of bad ideas though
that led to good ideas. And that is value.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.685
Thanks, man.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.050
All right, Nick. Look,
my word is still good.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.323
You know, if you don't think it can work,
we call it off.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.764
It's up to you, buddy.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.569
Where do we get untraceable phones?

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.927
- Ha, ha!
- There we go. That's our guy.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.691
- This guy.
- There we go.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.402
Prepaid with bitcoins.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.085
Jailbroken.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.730
A hundred percent untraceable.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.321
- We got it.
- Thanks. Solid. Thank you, Motherfucker.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.561
Good luck out there, boys.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.406
- What's that laugh about?
- I just said good luck.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.604
- That was a sinister giggle.
- You said it with a sinister giggle.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.730
I'm just saying that maybe you guys
might want a little advice.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.724
- Boy, that was predictable. No, thanks.
- We're good.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.407
- You know what, then? Get the fuck on.
- That's what I said. Get the fuck on.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.130
- Wait a minute.
- I don't like this.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.926
- I wanna hear what he has to say.
- Now you wanna hear?

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.607
- You got one on the hook.
- It'll cost 51 percent share of your company.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.885
You're out of your fucking mind.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.765
It's gonna cost you <i>2</i> percent share
of your company.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.407
- So weird how you negotiate.
- It won't be in existence. You can have that.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.723
- There's a middle ground.
- Here's the advice, young men.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.409
Y'all criminals.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.247
- It's never good advice.
- I can't find the advice.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.643
It's not even true, actually.
We're not criminals. All right?

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.450
- We got clicked into this.
- Shut up.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.120
See, you can't have this both ways.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.126
Every time you guys come here, you're like,
"We're a bunch of happy-go-lucky guys.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.443
Through no fault of our own,
we found ourselves in another pickle.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.410
We can't get our fingers out of our asses."
Fuck that.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.405
You're fucking criminals.
You've tried to kill your bosses.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.088
One of them ended up dead. And now you
want to perpetrate a kidnapping?

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.643
You three are the craziest motherfucking
criminals I've ever seen in my life.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.411
You wanna pull this shit off?

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.006
You gotta act like it.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.161
Word.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.610
Oh. That was embarrassing.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.842
We're trying to do a super cool
slow-mo walk.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.520
- Come on, man.
- Easy.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.364
- It's over. Let's go.
- Where you going?

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.490
- Moronic idea. I am mortified.
- Come on, man. Let's do the walk.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.130
You gotta stick with it.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.327
What do you think?
Should I beat myself up more?

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.280
No, you don't need to hit yourself anymore.
I think we should just make the call.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.523
Hold on. Before we kick this thing off,
can I just say something?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.483
I'm not really, ugh, good at this
kind of thing, you know? Um...

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.689
My mom died when I was 4, and, um...

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.366
You know, when you're raised
by Bert Hanson...

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.484
...most of your friends are shitheads.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.730
Um...

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.009
Yeah. I know I dragged you guys into this,
but I'm not sorry.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.531
Because...

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.408
...I'm really glad I met you guys.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.166
Anyway, I want you guys to have this.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.562
- What is it?
- It's an actual fang from Predator.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.165
- Predator the movie?
- Yep.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.527
I want you to have it.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.886
- For real?
- Swear to God.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.561
<i>Do you</i> like <i>Predator?</i>

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.886
Yeah, I like Predator.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.243
- Kurty?
- Yeah. Yeah, I like Predator too.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.370
I mean "also," not the sequel.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.965
- Nick?
- Oh, well...

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.408
...I didn't like Predator
when I first saw it...

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.404
...but it grew on me quite a bit.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.244
I like Predator a great deal.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.763
Are we talking about him or Predator?
I'm terrible with metaphors.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.127
- Let's make the phone call.
- It was lost on me.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.361
Most things are.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.047
Yeah.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.571
You got that cash?

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.449
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.206
Now, I want you to sashay up
to the 4th Street Bridge.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.284
You're gonna find a bench about halfway up,
take a load off.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.603
<i>And you bring the amount that we
agreed upon and you come alone.</i>

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.082
And if you do, you will find your son
returned home lickety-splickety.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.204
Fourth Street Bridge,
he's gonna have him drop it over the side.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.285
Now, I want every inch covered,
but everyone holds a safe distance.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.602
Yeah, but not too safe a distance.
Understand?

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.286
This bag is your number fucking one
priority.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.484
No, actually, your son's life
is our number one priority.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.971
Yeah, you know what I mean.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.809
Yeah, I think I do.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.290
Does anybody have a visual?

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.010
Bridge is still clear, chief.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.606
<i>Hanson approaching. ETA, two minutes.</i>

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.690
The Blade is in position.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.648
Majestic, in position.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.407
I am in...

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.642
Kill Shot is in position.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.366
- Whoa, "Kill Shot"?
- Yeah, I wanna be Kill Shot.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.923
- Then you are Kill Shot. I love it.
- Pretty sweet name there, Nick.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.004
Ooh. We don't wanna use real names
if we're using code names, Dale.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.522
<i>- Don't say my name, Kurt.
- Mine was an accident. Yours was on purpose.</i>

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.682
- I don't think yours was an accident.
- What?

01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:59.968
Why are we on walkie-talkies
in the same room?

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.491
We're checking the equipment.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.041
We don't need to.
He's on a TV remote control.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.440
I was trying to participate.
I didn't have anything to...

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.206
Hey. Hold up. The Blade's got a visual.
He's here. He's here.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.640
- Here we go.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.804
- All right. Kill Shot, make the call.
- I'm dialing. Here we go.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.007
Oh, my God.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.444
Hey, what's that? Who's calling you?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.729
- I don't know. It's blocked.
- Oh, no.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.691
- Hello.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.207
- Who is this?
- It's me, dickless.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.289
You're supposed to call the dark phone.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.131
It's in your hand.
You were to tape that under the bench.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.402
No, that's not... Oh, wait.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.731
Oh.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.082
Oh, shit. So, what phone does he have?

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.483
Bert has Kurt's phone
with our contact information on it.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.211
And the pictures of us
from when we used to be friends?

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.488
Knock it off. Look, this is no big deal.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.002
We'll do it tomorrow.
As long as we don't call, he'll never find it.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.161
He found it.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.806
- He what? How?
- We are screwed.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.611
- Shit.
- Wait, wait, wait. I got an idea. I got an idea.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.764
Call your phone. If he's talking,
he's not gonna look through it.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.490
- What's your number?
- You don't know?

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.371
- I don't know my number.
- I don't know. I never call myself.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.284
I know both of your numbers. 323...

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.011
- That's all I need. I got there. Here we go.
- Okay, yes.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.407
- Here we go. Okay. All right. Ahem.
- Right, okay.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.527
Call coming in. "Roar" by Katy Perry.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.922
These guys are confident.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.561
Yeah, hello.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.484
Look like the grasshopper found himself...

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.246
...a blade of grass to sit upon.
- Too much.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.449
- Hello.
- Let's get this over with, pretend cowboy.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.211
Now, listen, I need you to proceed
to the Mandrake Hotel.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.331
I need you to go underground into parking.
I need you to get to Spot 4421.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.921
<i>You're gonna see a big old bag there.
Fill it up.</i>

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.449
And then I need you to proceed north onto
Figueroa and await further instructions.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.647
Wait, wait.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.930
And don't think we don't know you got the
law with you. That's something we do know.

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.289
<i>All right? So if any of them cavalry
follow you down in the garage...</i>

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.683
...I'm personally gonna stick a hot poker
so far up your son's ass...

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.561
...I'm gonna pop his teeth like popcorn!

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.686
See? We're back on track.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.801
I gotta get that phone back.
So many dick pics.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.724
- Really?
- Yeah, not all mine, though.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.926
With game-time traffic, he could be here
in less than 10 minutes. How we doing?

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.162
- Almost done.
- Where are the bellhop costumes?

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.520
- What?
- Bellhop costumes.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.564
Aren't we dressed as bellhops
when we escape with the money?

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.245
This place doesn't have bellhops.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.487
- It doesn't?
- No.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.120
I thought there was supposed to be
some sweet-ass...

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.482
- What the fuck are these?
- It's not Halloween.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.927
- Best I could do on short notice.
- It's not scary.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.162
- Hey, how do I look?
- Who the hell are you?

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.970
- It's me, Kurt.
- I know that part.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.970
Terrible. You don't look like Bert,
you look like Mark Twain.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.846
None of this is like I pictured when we
were planning it. Everything was cooler.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.247
He just has to look good from a distance.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.482
- Here we go. Let's do it.
- Let's roll.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.326
Let's just do what we gotta do, do it
confidently and, uh, we should be fine.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.164
- Here we go.
- Oh.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.641
- Hi, boys.
- Oh, hi.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.123
You staying at the hotel, or is this your hotel?
You staying here?

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.964
I've been keeping my eye on you
since you broke into my office.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.090
I don't know what's going on here,
and I don't give a shit.

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.642
- Why are you here? What do you want?
- I think you know what I want.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.370
No, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.841
Why can't this crazy bitch
get it through her head?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.480
- Keep it respectful. Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.086
- Don't call her that.
- I'm gonna make this simple.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.402
I'm gonna call the police
and send you to jail.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.686
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.604
Unless Dale plows me.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.600
Why? Why me?
What is so special about me?

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.127
That's a fair question.
Everybody's wondering.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.886
- I am.
- Did you ever collect anything, Dale?

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.327
- Don't get him going on this.
- What do I collect?

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.130
<i>- Tons of stuff.
- Encyclopedia Brown?</i>

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.045
- New Beanie Babies, makes no sense.
- Battlestar Galactica.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.204
- Fine. I collect some stuff. Why?
- Okay, well, I collect cocks.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.521
- Cogs?
- Julia.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.728
- "Cocks."
- Oh, yeah. Well...

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.803
Mm-hm. Right up here.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.522
I've got quite an impressive trophy room
filled with cocks.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.966
- We're in there.
- Don't.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.884
And at night, when I close my eyes...

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.881
...I reflect on them...

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.160
...I alphabetize them...

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.881
...I dust them.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.730
Why are they dusty?

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.087
But there's one little problem, Dale.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.720
See that space?
That empty space above the fireplace?

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.249
- See that?
- You got a cock missing?

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.243
That's reserved for the only man
who's ever said no to this.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.882
Since I was 11 years old.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.883
That's you, Dale.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.481
My white whale.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.805
Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that.
I really do. That's sweet, I guess.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.770
But, hey, here's an idea.
My friend Kurt here loves to plow.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.207
- And maybe he could jump in for me...
- Absolutely.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.442
I could pinch-plow. I
got a real green thumb.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.925
We all know this is just the addiction talking.
If you're looking for more than a quick fix...

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.329
...I can provide you something
that's very meaningful, long-lasting.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.811
What? What are you talking about?

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.366
I'm talking about us.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.329
- Us? All of us?
- No.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.561
- That's even better.
- No.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.963
More the merrier. I love this idea.
You got a lot of stuff sticking out.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.724
I got a lot of holes going in.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.726
At one point of the night, you'd better
make sure that, that one is in this one.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.531
- Thank you.
- That's not what I meant. You misunderstood.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.049
I'm gonna go freshen up. Why don't you guys
suck each other off to get ready?

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.205
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.890
What? She's making us fuck her.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.849
- I'm not gonna fuck anyone.
- Thank you.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.401
I'm willing to make love to her,
if that's required.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.722
- Are you serious?
- Uh, can I borrow this razor?

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.326
Yeah. Go nuts.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.642
Any requests? Landing strip? Dinner roll?

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.087
Uh, whatever's there.
We're in a rush. Thanks.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.005
- Hmm.
- I don't wanna commit adultery on my wife.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.482
No, it's not adultery if you're doing it
to save your family. Okay?

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.371
You think Stacy and your girls
are gonna wait for you...

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.000
...while you're in prison for 30 years?
- They're not.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.731
Can't we just come up
with some kind of plan, though?

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.929
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
I got a plan. Okay, here we go. Um, areas.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.764
I'll go butt, face, puss.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.605
I cannot go in the puss.
That'll make me the most guilty.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.207
- Good call. How about this? Butt, face, puss.
- That's where I should be.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.402
I'm talking about a way where...
That's good.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.484
If we're switching positions,
she'll lose track of who's where.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.007
- Like the shell game.
- Three-card Monte. Exactly.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.771
I can motorboat her boobies
and then smack on her butt.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.446
So long as nothing is done
in a cheap or degrading way.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.082
- We'll be as sensitive as Dr. Phil.
- I don't know if I can fuck this woman.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.642
- Think about your wife and girls.
<i>- I'll</i> think about my girls. I can get it done.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.087
- Ha.
- All right?

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.367
- Stacy.
- Oh, no.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.443
- How did you find me?
- Been there a while?

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.404
Find My iPhone.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.248
- I knew you were cheating on me.
- No, I'm not.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.131
- He's not. We're trying to stay out of prison.
- Prison?

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.486
No one's going to prison.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.610
- Because we were gonna kidnap someone.
- Kidnapping?

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.206
- No. First, the man kidnapped himself.
- That's right.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.402
- He forced us...
- Dale wouldn't even do puss.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.291
- I didn't even wanna do the puss.
- I chose ass both times.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.161
I said puss will make me the most guilty.
You're not helping me! Shut up!

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.288
Look, uh, this is such
a stupid thing, honey.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.886
And easy, and nothing sexual
is even happening here.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.004
Come on, Dale,
this pussy isn't gonna eat itself.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.321
- Julia?
- Stacy.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.686
And the babies.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.929
Look at those babies.
Oh, Dale, they look just like you.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.605
- Listen to me.
- You are sick.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.407
- I'm not sick. Please. Can I just...?
- Do not follow me. Do not follow me.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.926
You fucking bitch.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.251
Sorry. Really didn't
mean for that to happen.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.848
Okay, Julia. You wanna fuck?

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.201
Yeah. Heh.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.291
Why not, right? My marriage is over.
It's basically ruined.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.687
So how about I ruin that pussy?
That sound good?

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.490
- No, no, no. You're face.
- I'm puss.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.688
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. This one's all mine.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.001
What?

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.441
- Let's do it. Let's do it in the shower.
- Attaboy.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.921
Is that what you want?
Nice and wet in here.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.690
- I can't save my marriage from prison.
- No, you can't.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.524
- Great, Dale.
- Let's roll.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.409
- We lost the wire.
- Shit.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.562
Should we send in an unmarked?

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.922
We can't risk it. We'll hold here.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.008
Hello. Howdy-do.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.680
- You go on this side.
- Stop.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.211
Hey.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.646
What the fuck is this?

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.567
I do not need that sass-mouth. What I need
is that sack of cash. Now, get it over here.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.731
Don't you throw it at me. You slide it.
Do it again.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.684
- No, we'll keep it here.
- Check it.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.763
- Holy shit.
- Lookie there.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.922
- We did it.
- There's a pretty bag.

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.086
Okay. All right. Hey. I'll also take that
phone you took from the bottom of that bench.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.401
What?

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.604
- The cell phone. Give me the cell phone.
- Throw the phone to him.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.525
Now that fancy jacket and that snappy tie.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.523
- Get them off. Get them over.
- No.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.284
- He say "no"?
- I think he said no.

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.441
But we got this.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.365
- Don't make me use this six-shooter.
- Man's got a shooter.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.285
You make me sick.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.410
You're what's wrong with America.
Everyone just wants a handout.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.769
Take, take, take from the people
who earn their money honestly.

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.770
All right, let's not chitchat now.
The man does have a gun.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.691
You got a real lip on you.
I will shoot you in the chest.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.882
Well, go ahead. Shoot me.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:16.362
- You don't have the balls.
- Yeah, he does. He got big old balls.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.488
Big mouth. Nothing behind it.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.400
- Dude.
- Oh, my God.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.800
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.041
What did you do?

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.611
- You shot him.
- No, I didn't.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.888
- You did.
- That was not supposed to be loaded.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.122
- What do you mean?
- That's not my fault.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.481
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, hold...

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.167
Man. You should've seen
your faces right now...

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.004
...when you started blaming each other.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.640
What's happening right now?

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.730
I'm fucking you over.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.686
- No, no. But we're all friends now.
- We are, but what a great twist, right?

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.811
At first I was just gonna take all the
money and throw you guys under the bus.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.325
I mean, come on. Duh.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.769
But then when Dad called the cops and
proved he doesn't give a fuck about me...

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.607
...I realized, why take a
few of his millions...

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.809
...when I can inherit all of them
and you guys can take the fall?

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:18.284
In minutes, the police will be down here and
discover that you killed my poor father...

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.125
...with a gun you stole from my room
when you abducted me.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.805
That is a lie!

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.886
- He knows.
- He knows. He knows.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.764
Don't worry, guys-

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.689
I'll take it from here.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.530
Sorry, Rex.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.881
But we got you.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.122
<i>Why take</i> a <i>few of his millions...</i>

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.851
<i>...when I can inherit all of them
and you guys can take the fall?</i>

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.684
Ooh. Checkmate, bitch.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:47.040
- All right, here. Let's have that.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.202
- No, I... Right. Sorry.
- Thanks, man.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.405
Didn't wanna hold onto that
for two more minutes?

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.523
No, that was a gift.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.010
- Did you park the Prius in the back alley?
- I sure did.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.288
- Do you have the keys?
- Here you go.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.967
I'm really proud of you guys.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.007
Seriously. You pulled together.
You worked like a team. Just like we planned.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.368
Dale, we had a lot of laughs.

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.091
I really appreciate it.
I mean, you made me smile.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:20.002
Nick, I want you to smile more.
You know? Look at those frown lines.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.682
Take a vacation. Lighten up.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.091
- Kurt, I think I'm gonna miss you the most.
- Why?

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.924
Okay.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.206
Bye.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.407
Catch.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.761
- Don't...
- Goddamn it.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.571
Sorry. I just have good hands.
Fuck. Hang on a second.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.086
Hey, freeze. Freeze.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.084
Ha, ha. Dale, come on.
You think I'd give you a loaded gun?

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.606
Ah, Shit.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.926
I gotta get going. Gotta wait to be saved
at the warehouse by the cops. See you.

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.606
Oh, shit. Good luck talking to the cops.
You have your dad's blood all over... Oh!

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.446
- Can we not keep anything to ourselves?
- Fuck me. I'm so sorry.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:59.810
- That's worse than what I did. What did I do?
- You're friends with him. You introduced me.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.884
We're not gonna be afraid of
an unloaded gun, Rex, you dipshit.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.647
- He's got bullets. He's got bullets.
- He's got bullets? Fucking hell.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.724
Kurt, what are you? A 32 waist?

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.406
- Oh, dear God. He's gonna rape us.
- No.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.126
- Oh, you just want my...
- He just wants the pants.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.645
All-time shittiest idea you guys ever had.
Can't believe you talked me into this.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.928
- This guy's dead now.
- I know that.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.122
- He's dead.
- We should've stayed cogs.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.045
This is taking too damn long.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.966
Shit.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.607
This isn't about the bag.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.603
This is the goddamn drop.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.843
Move in. Everybody move in now.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.970
- Take off the incriminating pants.
- Run around in my underwear?

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.480
Why not throw the body in the trunk?
We got 5 million bucks.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.768
There's police everywhere.
We're not gonna get away.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.850
Oh, shit.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.364
- Grab the bag. Get the fuck in.
- Why?

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.171
Lead the cops to that warehouse
before your boy gets there.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.330
If they see him out walking free,
they just might believe your ass. Let's go.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:11.361
Get the money.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.844
Hey. Hey, guys-

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.048
Goddamn it. It's those idiots.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.283
I knew I never said anything
about kidnapping.

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.126
- Come on. Let's go.
- Following us is already a part of their plan.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.489
- You never know. Wanna make sure.
- What is the seat-belt situation?

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.369
- I got mine.
- We should put them on.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.966
- Can I get under yours?
- Hold on to the dashboard.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.491
- Shit.
- This is the wrong way.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.120
This is the wrong way. Turn around.
Stop the car.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.810
- Who you texting?
- My lady.

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.089
- Put it down.
- If I don't check in, she goes crazy.

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.129
By the way, what the hell were you doing back
there in that garage in the first place?

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.085
What's that, now?

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.526
- Holy shit.
- What's going on?

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.961
You were down there
to steal the ransom money.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.645
Listen, I hustle, I don't steal.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.485
What the fuck does that...?
What were you doing in the garage?

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.844
I was thinking there was a chance...

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.685
...the drop might go south,
and that guy would kill y'all.

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.810
And in such a scenario,
you'd rather me have the cash than him.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.486
- He was betting against us.
- You motherfucker.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.281
- I was honoring your potential death.
- Honoring us?

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.487
What are we, samurai?

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.642
Wait, hold on. Oh, hey. Train.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.848
- Train! Train! Train!
- Train!

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.011
- Nice! Woo-hoo!
- Damn it.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.730
That's how you lose the cops.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.690
- We're not supposed to lose the cops.
- Don't lose the cops.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.891
That's the whole idea.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.361
- It was a good thought.
- Going back. This is great.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.881
I wish you'd slow down.
You wouldn't make mistakes.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.646
Don't criticize the man.
He's doing the best he can.

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.048
Here, I'll let them know. Hold on.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.880
Hey. We're back. We'll stay here...

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.283
...till all this shit goes by.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.726
Then we'll all roll.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.891
What the fuck are these assholes doing?

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.208
- They get that?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.727
- What's that you're carrying around?
- What is that?

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.211
It's for my kitties.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.771
- You got kittens?
- Surprising.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.804
- I can't have kittens?
- Why you always jumping on everything?

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.009
- It's weird you're hauling around a cat stand.
- I love pussy.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.164
- Hey, can I hop out and piss?
- No. We're in a car chase.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.722
- Super long train. I feel I could get it done.
- It is a lot of freight.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.170
<i>Hold the line</i>

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.362
It probably needs...

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.806
<i>Love isn't always on time</i>

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.690
<i>Hold the line</i>

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:59.446
It's just too goddamn easy.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.323
- I feel like I could have pissed by now.
- Let him go. Open the door.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.323
- Caboose coming.
- Ah, shit.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.324
Oh, shit. Cops.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.131
- Cops. Cops.
- Shit.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.720
- What happened?
- You lost your stuff.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.081
- What? Damn it.
- Yeah, you lost your cat stuff.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.761
Okay, there's a man there.
Watch out for him.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.967
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.922
- Hey, we're boxed in here.
- Not for long.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.845
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted to do this.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.408
<i>Gotta make it last</i>

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.369
<i>I touch you once</i>

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.602
<i>I touch you twice</i>

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.166
Shit.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.805
What?

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.041
So where is this place?

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.447
It's up here. Under the bridge.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.124
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to go under the bridge.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.203
Relax.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.402
- The wheels are locked.
- Pump the brakes.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.050
- Shift down.
- Put it in park.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.247
I can't think.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.280
Bet y'all loving this fence now.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.120
I've come around to the whole fence thing.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.208
I would've loved a seat belt too.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.880
Well, what's the next part of the plan,
Motherfucker?

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.920
Ow.

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.205
There. There. There.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.642
- Hey. Hey, he's not here. We beat him.
- What?

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.961
- We beat him.
- Hey.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.606
- Ha, ha!
- Hey, nice job...

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.923
- Where's Motherfucker?
- I don't know.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.761
Cops. Cops.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.565
<i>Hey-</i>

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.405
- Get out of the car.
- Easy.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.564
- Hands up.
- Relax. Please, put your guns down.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.961
We didn't kill anybody. I swear to God.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.567
- I don't give a goddamn. Tell it to the judge.
- We didn't kidnap anybody.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.041
He kidnapped himself.
He'll sneak in any second.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.283
- He was supposed to be tied up to that chair.
- Right behind you.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.722
Who? Him?

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.766
Yeah.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:45.729
Aw, that looks bad. That looks bad.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.201
- This fucking guy.
- You gotta believe us.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.206
That's them. Those three, they tortured me,
then said they were gonna kill my dad.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.522
- Oh, don't listen to that.
- That's garbage.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.451
Tell me he's okay. Please.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.921
- I'm sorry, son.
- No.

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.402
- No.
- He killed his father.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.211
- He's a very strong actor. Bravo.
- Don't buy it.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:08.280
- Get on the ground.
- We're getting down.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.807
I can't believe you're buying that acting.
I mean, it's good, but...

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.321
You have the right to
remain silent, assholes.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.770
You have the right to an attorney, asshole.
You have...

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.202
Hey. Hey, that's my phone. He has my phone.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.806
- The phone Bert had on the bench.
- Check that phone.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.806
If he was tied up here the whole time,
how could Rex have the same phone?

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:33.201
- They switched pants!
- Yeah. They got it.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.328
- Check it.
- It's the same ringtone, sir.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.723
Yeah. That's my phone.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:40.531
I have the same ringtone.
It's an inspiring ringtone.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.081
You were here this whole time
with a cell phone...

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.169
...and didn't bother to call the police?

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.368
- Ah! Ah, ha, ha!
- Yes.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.329
Shut the fuck up.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.721
Let me see it.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.882
I said let me see it.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.085
Okay.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.288
- Everybody move the fuck off.
- Yeah, he looks pretty guilty now, right?

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.568
He's definitely suspect.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.091
Drop your fucking guns.

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.925
You shoot this prick.
You shoot this prick right now.

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.607
You drop your guns or I'll blow
his fucking head off. You hear me? Move.

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.921
Move.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.245
He's gonna get away with this.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.920
- This guy doesn't quit.
- He's incredibly resilient.

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:22.084
- You. Keys in the car?
- Keys are in the car.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.408
- This fucking guy.
- Calm down.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.848
This fucking guy took everything from me.
"Calm down, Dale"? No.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.924
- Fuck this fucking guy. He took my wife.
- All right, step away.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.602
- He took my kids. I'm gonna do something.
- Easy. What are you gonna do?

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:37.969
- Look who's the predator now, bitch.
- Wait, Dale. What are you doing?

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.330
- Dale.
- Oh, I'm shot.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.485
Get in there. Get him.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.288
Cuff this crazy asshole. And beat the shit
out of him while you're at it.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.329
- Oh, shit.
- Dale, buddy, you okay? Hey.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.567
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.245
- Oh, shit.
- What was that?

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.125
Dale, let's put this down.
What was the plan here, buddy?

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.489
- I overreacted. It's not even sharp.
- Adrenaline.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.971
Did it just graze me, or...?

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.964
No, you got hit right in the square
of the fucking chest.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:11.242
- Went straight through.
- You're gonna be fine.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.767
No, I don't know about that.
That's a lot of blood.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.241
- Don't listen to him. You're gonna make it.
- Ah, fuck.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.323
Hey, if you want hope, listen to him.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.882
If you want the truth, I'm your fucking guy,
all right? This is bad news.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.567
- Can we get some help here?
- Don't worry. We're gonna get you fixed up.

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:27.922
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Is it bad? Is it bad?

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.810
- That's a big fucking hole.
- Yeah.

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.442
- I'm gonna go to this light right here.
- If you've gotta go, you gotta go.

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.201
- Please don't let me die with him talking.
- I'll take care of Stacy and your boys.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.810
- That couldn't be more annoying.
- I'm not trying to be annoying.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.803
- I'm trying to have fun.
- It's annoying.

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:52.964
- It worked though. Look at that.
- Look who's talking. You okay?

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.891
You've been drifting in and out.
Nice to hear you talking.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.162
So, what do the doctors say?
Am I gonna die?

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.481
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.564
- No.
- We're all gonna die.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:04.041
It's been touch-and-go,
but you're gonna be fine.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.565
Doctors are gonna let you out.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.326
- That's good.
- They did have to give you a bird's heart.

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.845
- Oh, God.
- You okay with that?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.161
- No.
- He's kidding.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.971
- We're kidding.
- That heart would've been too old for me.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.121
How long was I out?

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.611
- Two years.
- Really?

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:17.966
- Four days.
- That's better.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.771
Why didn't you play?
Thought we were gonna say two years.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.331
We've got a woman president.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.167
Shit.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.408
- Look who's here.
- Oh, my gosh. He's talking.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.767
- You're talking. Hi.
- We'll leave you alone.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:33.845
Please. Let me explain everything to you,
there are so many misunderstandings.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.891
- It's okay. Julia explained everything.
- Don't talk to her. She's crazy.

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.323
She told me everything she put you through
because of her affliction.

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.766
"Her affliction"?

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.962
It's heartbreaking
what she's been through.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.521
- Hi.
- She also told me that my husband...

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.365
...is the only one that ever resisted her.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.883
- Okay.
- Dale, you are one lucky man.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.646
Your wife is so understanding and caring.

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.690
- Right.
- So beautiful.

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.650
She has been so supportive with the babies.
And helpful.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.883
Oh. Please, it's the least I can do
to make amends for my bad behavior.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.087
Okay.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.527
I'm gonna find Dr. Mike,
tell him you're talking.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.241
Okay, good. Go get the doctor
because I'm feeling a little...

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.731
What is going on here?

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.726
What's up? I'm off the hook? No more
white-whale business? Or any of that?

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.406
- Mm-hm. No more. You're off the hook.
- Really?

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.204
Did you know that when men are in a coma
they can still get an erection?

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.931
It's true, Dale. Coma boners.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.889
"Coma boner"? What?

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.171
Lots and lots of coma boners.

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.288
Think about it.

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.363
- Oh, shit.
- All right, well, I better go.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:44.086
I'm booking a spa day for me and Stacy.

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:49.441
- I'm gonna fuck your wife, Dale.
- No, no.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.843
No. Uh, no, you're not.
Hang on. Hang on. No.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.968
- Hey, there she is.
- Boys.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.449
You look fantastic. You know, I've been
sending you a lot of unanswered texts.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.241
- That's not how you catch them.
- I think she said she's gonna fuck my wife.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.244
- Thought she already did.
- That horse may have left the barn.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.448
I figured those guys
have been bumping tacos.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.683
- Super touchy-feely lately.
- I can't process this. This is too much.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.087
Anyway, so, what's even going on?

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.084
- Did we get in trouble with the police, or...?
- We did, yeah.

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.971
- Yeah. A lot.
- We got arrested for a long list of felonies.

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.683
But because you took a bullet for
the detective, DA got rid of the biggies.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.844
- Dropped some charges? Nice.
- You're like a little Kevin Costner.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.206
You're our bodyguard.

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:33.444
Ha, ha. Pretty sweet. All right,
so I'm guessing we saved the business.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.011
- Nope. We did not.
- We did not.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.080
<i>The bank foreclosed</i> a <i>couple days ago.</i>

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:42.963
Going once, going twice, sold.
To D.H. Commercial Trust.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.960
<i>But there's good news. The guy who
bought the company is keeping us on to run it.</i>

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.162
- If we bring that down to $300, you've got...
- Lupe. All right.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.446
Hola, Lupe.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.003
<i>- Uh, SkyMall?
- Sí, SkyMall.</i>

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.801
Great. That's great news.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.930
- Uh, <i>SkyMall</i> order is ready to ship.
- The boss is gonna love that.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.287
Yes. Let's go show him
these great numbers too.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.684
Are we happy with these numbers?

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.881
They're pretty good.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:15.963
- Room for improvement.
- We can do better.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.246
Oh, my God.

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.609
I just realized. You actually thought
you were bringing me good news.

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.321
The three of you walked in with smiles
on your fucking pathetic faces.

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.360
Why were you born?
Why were the three of you born?

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:30.967
Looking at you is like looking out
over the Grand Canyon of ineptitude.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.327
It's a wonder your parents
didn't smother you...

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.164
- Where you going?
- See you next week.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.561
I have an idea.
Why don't you try a suicide pact?

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.810
And I'm not talking about throwing yourself
off a building or some sleeping-pills shit.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.042
I'm talking about,
you fuck each other to death.

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:47.045
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
I own you!

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.800
Well, we have several franchise
opportunities available in your area.

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:01.725
But, uh, purchasing a store requires...

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.850
...a significant up-front investment.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.844
Well, in that case...

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.688
...start me off with three locations.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.043
I'm sure that we can accommodate you,
Mr. Jones.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.370
Please. Mr. Jones? That's my daddy.

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.170
Call me Motherfucker.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:31.209
Every... This guy.

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:37.924
Okay. First we tie up Rex in one
of those abandoned warehouses off 3rd.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.204
First we're gonna tie up Rex...

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.606
First we're gonna tie up Rex...
Fuck off, everyone.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.129
As soon as Bert's car is underground, heh,
the police lose...

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.362
Bert's car goes underground, right?

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.887
Police lose the signal from the wire.

01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.168
Do you guys validate parking? Not you
personally, obviously, that'd be racist.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.121
You're gonna pull into Space 4421...

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.801
I gotta call you back.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.890
The bank foreclosed two days ago.

01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.163
- Hey, but there is good news.
- Really?

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:19.967
"Really?"

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.963
We need to talk to somebody legitimate.

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.125
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.411
I can't take you to the next scene
any better than that. I can't.

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.081
Well, then I would marry Daniel Craig...

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.481
...I'd fuck Sean Connery
and kill Timothy Dalton.

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.247
I would marry Ed Helms, fuck Bradley
Cooper and kill Zach Galifianakis.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.803
Marry Crackle, fuck Snap, kill Pop. Right?

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.720
Oh, my God.
Do you know what this looks like?

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.126
What?

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:50.569
It looks like we don't
know what we're doing.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.880
Boy, I'd love it if you'd
stop saying my name.

01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.368
Hang on a second. Hey, freeze.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.682
Guess who's got the gun now.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.171
Me.

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.009
Where do you think she learned it?

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.521
Maybe from the first movie.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.931
- Get that chair ready. I'm gonna take a tinkle.
- Oh, but I'm thirsty.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.445
Save me a shake.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.410
I just can't say it.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.648
So you wanna use the ransom...

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.006
What is it?

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.846
"Y'all plan to use the ransom
to save y'all business."

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.365
I just like to hear you say it.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.207
Come on, man.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.801
Help me help you get revenge
on my asshole...

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.762
- My asshole...
- Asshole dad.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.961
You have to take what's yours in this...
In this...

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.569
- I mean, you have to...
- You have to...

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.166
- ...take what's yours in this life.
- Take it.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.560
Grab it!

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:03.842
You will pass your empty,
sac-less ball sacs...

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.047
No, that's...

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:10.805
"Empty shriveled sacs." They're shriveled.
I should know that just looking at you.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.680
That's your credit picture right there.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.168
- Here comes the heavy.
- I smell dog shit.

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.805
- Do you really?
- Yeah.

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.485
It might be your acting.
