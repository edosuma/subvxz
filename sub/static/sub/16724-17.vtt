no shaving, no deodorant.

You happen to be

01:24.899 --> 01:27.034
in the presence
of child straw prodigies.

01:27.035 --> 01:28.635
We're pretty straw-some.

01:28.636 --> 01:30.537
That's awesome, but with straws?
Strawsome?

01:30.538 --> 01:32.373

can use a little wind?

with that thing?

it's trash day.

02:07.275 --> 02:09.175
Wait. We weren't a band before?

02:09.176 --> 02:13.180
Uh... before we had the "raz,"
but we needed the "matazz."

02:13.181 --> 02:14.915
So... what do you say?

02:14.916 --> 02:16.583
Yeah! Let's do it! Okay.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.552
All right, but I don't carry
my own equipment.

02:18.553 --> 02:20.220
Yeah! That's the spirit!

02:20.255 --> 02:21.755
Okay, thanks, Doc.

talk about rashes.

02:23.258 --> 02:24.725
What did she say?

02:24.726 --> 02:26.427
The rash'll probably
go away on its own,

02:26.428 --> 02:28.362
but I got to wear a tank
top to let it breathe.

02:28.363 --> 02:29.863
It's festering
under there, I guess.

02:29.864 --> 02:31.899
Look at it.
Can you see it? Lin, please!

02:31.900 --> 02:33.367
It's like
my grandma used to say.

02:33.368 --> 02:35.035
Starve a fever, feed a cold

02:35.036 --> 02:37.104

rash in a tank top.

02:42.377 --> 02:44.578
Dad, this is the noise
of a band.

02:46.081 --> 02:48.115

06:53.859 --> 06:55.760
from "Gene" to "Lenny,"
and it was a nickel.

08:04.863 --> 08:07.398
Yes, Tina, I'm right here...
behind the armpit hair.

08:07.432 --> 08:08.466
Oh. Good.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.568
I love it! We finally have pets.

08:10.569 --> 08:12.203
I'm calling them
"Laverne and Curly."

08:12.237 --> 08:14.639
Too late. I already named them
"Harry and Sally."

08:14.673 --> 08:16.674
Wait. One's a boy?
Obviously.

08:16.675 --> 08:19.510
It's not a boy. It's a man!
No, it's not! I'd know

08:19.511 --> 08:22.179
if one was Billy Crystal.
Everyone leave my pits alone!

08:22.214 --> 08:24.048
That one just got angry
when you got angry.

08:24.082 --> 08:25.283
Enough!

08:25.284 --> 08:26.784
So, Linda's cooking today?

08:26.785 --> 08:29.053
Yeah, she, uh,
thought she'd be more

08:29.087 --> 08:31.422
comfortable back there today.
I'm hiding my pits.

08:31.456 --> 08:32.857
Lin, would it help
if I took off my shirt

08:32.857 --> 08:34.292
in a show of solidarity?

08:34.293 --> 08:35.993
I got some weird stuff
going on under here.

08:36.028 --> 08:37.160
No. Teddy, no.
Maybe.

08:37.195 --> 08:38.796
Surprise!

08:38.797 --> 08:40.331
As in surprise inspection.

08:40.365 --> 08:41.899
Ugh. Hugo.
Hi.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.368
Hi, Ron.
I see you're busy as usual.

08:44.369 --> 08:46.337
Just do what
you got to do, Hugo.

08:46.371 --> 08:49.407
Write me up for disorganized
napkins or whatever.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.208
Oh, count on it, Bob.
I will.

08:51.209 --> 08:52.810
But let's inspect
the kitchen first.

08:53.912 --> 08:54.879
Hello, Hugo.
Hi, Ron.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.547
Hi, Linda.

08:56.548 --> 08:58.549
Linda, something is unusual
about you today.

08:58.550 --> 09:00.184
What is that?

09:00.218 --> 09:02.019
What? Nothing.
It's nothing.

09:02.054 --> 09:03.688
Think fast!
Ah!

09:03.722 --> 09:05.156
Aha!
Aw.

09:05.157 --> 09:06.791
Linda here is in violation

09:06.792 --> 09:09.560
of Health Code Title 21,
Section A, Paragraph eight.

09:09.561 --> 09:11.562
"Excessive body hair
must be covered."

09:11.596 --> 09:13.264
But I need to wear a tank top.

09:13.298 --> 09:14.732
Need to? Why?

09:14.733 --> 09:16.767
Because of this rash...
shida Jones.

09:16.768 --> 09:18.336
Uh, big fan.
Oh, yeah.

09:18.337 --> 09:19.770
She likes tank tops, too.

09:19.771 --> 09:21.872
She does.
She loves them. Uh-huh.

09:21.907 --> 09:23.908
Well, I happen to have
some armpit hairnets with me.

09:23.909 --> 09:25.409
Ron?
Here you go.

09:25.444 --> 09:27.144
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

09:27.145 --> 09:29.413
If you want to avoid a citation,
you'll keep those on.

09:29.414 --> 09:31.515
Come on, Ron.
Let's go down to the walk-in.

09:31.516 --> 09:33.150
Poke the produce,
see what pokes back.

09:33.185 --> 09:35.086
Great. Now I look ridiculous.

09:35.087 --> 09:37.088
No. They look... good?

09:37.089 --> 09:38.990
Yeah, very, uh... Wow.

09:38.991 --> 09:41.459
It looks like I trapped
two hedgehogs under my arms.

09:41.460 --> 09:42.827
It doesn't...
that much.

09:42.828 --> 09:44.261
I love hedgehogs.
I got to go!

09:44.262 --> 09:45.630
Lin, where are you going?

09:45.631 --> 09:47.098
I'm shaving 'em!

09:47.132 --> 09:48.599
Lin, wait.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.001
Teddy, I'll be right back.

09:50.002 --> 09:51.602
I got to go.
Go to her, Bobby!

09:51.603 --> 09:54.438
Lin, don't do this.
I'm doing it, Bob!

09:54.473 --> 09:56.274
I'm taking it all off!

09:56.275 --> 09:58.776
The doctor said if you shave,
you're just gonna make it worse.

09:58.777 --> 10:01.646
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but leave the hair alone.

10:01.647 --> 10:03.481
I hate this rash, Bobby!

10:03.515 --> 10:05.316
It's turning me into a monster!

10:05.317 --> 10:06.851
You're not a monster, Lin.

10:06.852 --> 10:09.353
Your armpits have
monster qualities, but...

10:09.354 --> 10:11.689
Look, we're gonna fix this. How?

10:11.690 --> 10:13.190
First, you got
to give me the razor.

10:13.191 --> 10:14.659
You're gonna do it?

10:14.660 --> 10:17.361
No. I wouldn't... go near that.
Bob!

10:17.362 --> 10:19.196
We'd have
to rent a hedge trimmer,

10:19.197 --> 10:21.165
or hire, like, a lumberjack
or something like that.

10:21.199 --> 10:22.733
Stop it!

10:22.734 --> 10:24.468
Lin, listen, we're gonna
go on the Internet.

10:24.469 --> 10:26.971
Yeah? We're gonna type
in "rash remedies."

10:26.972 --> 10:30.541
Uh-huh. And we're gonna see
some horrible, horrible images.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.209
But we're also
gonna get some help.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.945
I love you so much, Bobby!

10:37.883 --> 10:39.817
Hi. Wait.

10:39.818 --> 10:41.052
Did we have practice
scheduled during lunch today?

10:41.053 --> 10:42.486
Hey...

10:42.521 --> 10:43.854
Gene.

10:43.855 --> 10:46.791
Uh, maybe, uh,
you should sit down.

10:46.825 --> 10:48.559
Oh, good! I got here
just in time for break,

10:48.560 --> 10:49.927
my favorite part of practice.

10:49.928 --> 10:51.329
Who's on whose lap?

10:51.363 --> 10:52.730
Gene, there's...
there's a reason

10:52.731 --> 10:54.598
why we were practicing
without you.

10:54.599 --> 10:57.134
Because you guys need twice
as much practice as me?

10:57.169 --> 11:00.938
No... It's because
we're making some changes,

11:00.939 --> 11:03.240
and, uh, you are, uh...

11:03.241 --> 11:04.909
We thought we should
be in the band,

11:04.910 --> 11:06.644
and you shouldn't be
in the band. Sorry.

11:06.678 --> 11:08.279
What?! I'm out of the band?!

11:08.280 --> 11:10.815
Well, good luck getting
my sisters to play without me!

11:10.849 --> 11:12.249
Oh, yeah. They're out, too.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.218
Yeah. We're sort of evolving
away from straws.

11:14.219 --> 11:17.622
The thing is, Gene, Rudy
and Peter are trained musicians.

11:17.623 --> 11:21.225
And I kind of figured out how
to sing all your keyboard parts.

11:21.259 --> 11:24.595
You can't sing my part and sing
lyrics at the same time!

11:24.630 --> 11:27.298
Gene, he can.
We've seen it and it's so good.

11:27.299 --> 11:30.368
Yeah, I brought in
a looper pedal, so I can just...

11:30.369 --> 11:31.769
♪ Skoop bop boo boo ♪

11:31.770 --> 11:33.404
♪ Skoop bop boo boo ♪

11:33.405 --> 11:34.805
♪ Skoop bop boo boo,
skoop bop boo boo... ♪

11:34.806 --> 11:36.474
♪ I can sing on top
of my voice ♪

11:36.475 --> 11:39.844
♪ That's me,
this is also me... ♪

11:39.878 --> 11:41.946
But this is my band!
I started all of this!

11:41.947 --> 11:43.714
Yeah, and you're, like,
the most fun member.

11:43.715 --> 11:45.549
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm all drama.

11:45.550 --> 11:47.551
But the thing is
you can't actually...

11:47.552 --> 11:49.553
play.
You only know three chords!

11:49.554 --> 11:51.122
But I know them very well!

11:51.123 --> 11:53.124
Well, two of them
I know very well!

11:53.125 --> 11:55.526
The other one I'm just
getting acquainted with!

11:55.560 --> 11:57.228
This is hard for everyone, Gene.

11:57.262 --> 11:58.462
But mostly for me!

11:58.497 --> 11:59.563
Yeah.
True.

11:59.598 --> 12:00.965
Fine!
You know what I'm gonna do?

12:00.966 --> 12:02.600
I'm gonna get
really, really good

12:02.601 --> 12:04.468
in time for Lenny's party!
Lenny's party's

12:04.503 --> 12:06.938
in two days, Gene.
I know that, Darryl!

12:06.939 --> 12:08.839
You guys are gonna be begging me

12:08.840 --> 12:11.876
to listen to you
beg me to come back!

12:11.910 --> 12:13.244
The door's always open, Gene.

12:13.245 --> 12:15.579
Except can you close it
on your way out?

12:15.614 --> 12:17.615
I will slam it!

12:19.952 --> 12:22.253
Stupid safety door
closing thing!

12:25.217 --> 12:27.153
Oh, kicked out of your own band.

12:27.154 --> 12:28.488
They David Lee Roth'd you.

12:28.522 --> 12:30.323
I'm glad we got kicked out.

12:30.324 --> 12:32.825
That was starting to cut into my
not-going-to-band-practice time.

12:32.826 --> 12:35.228
And that time is precious.
I'm okay with it.

12:35.229 --> 12:37.163
Now I can focus
on my solo straw stuff.

12:37.164 --> 12:38.598
Like drinking liquids.

12:38.599 --> 12:40.400
Guys,
we're gonna get back together.

12:40.401 --> 12:42.268
I'm just gonna become the
greatest musician in the world

12:42.269 --> 12:45.405
in the next 48 hours
and that'll be that. Easy.

12:45.406 --> 12:47.006
What are you gonna do, Gene?
Go down to the crossroads,

12:47.007 --> 12:48.541
make a deal with the devil?

12:48.542 --> 12:51.444
Almost. I'm gonna ask
Ms. Merkin to teach me.

12:51.445 --> 12:52.578
The music teacher at school?

12:52.613 --> 12:53.913
The Queen of the Keys?

12:53.914 --> 12:55.715
Yep! I figure
one quick power sesh

12:55.716 --> 12:57.417
should get me ready
for Lenny's party.

12:57.418 --> 12:59.752
Great plan, honey.
I'm ready for the garlic, Bob.

12:59.753 --> 13:01.554
Not to be all Miss
When Is Dinner

13:01.555 --> 13:03.122
but when is dinner?
And what is dinner?

13:03.123 --> 13:05.124
You've been stirring
that stuff forever.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.794
Oh, this isn't dinner. This is a
home remedy for my armpit rash.

13:07.795 --> 13:09.062
We found it online.

13:09.096 --> 13:11.097
What?! It's well past
dinnertime!

13:11.098 --> 13:13.800
Sorry. It's just...
feed your children.

13:13.801 --> 13:15.435
Okay, uh, Bob,
hand me the oatmeal,

13:15.436 --> 13:17.270
the fish oil,
and the buttermilk.

13:17.271 --> 13:20.306
No fair. Why do your armpits
get to eat all the fun stuff?

13:20.307 --> 13:21.941
Oh, it smells really weird.

13:21.942 --> 13:24.277
Hmm. It's not that bad.

13:24.278 --> 13:26.713
I mean, it's a little weird.
Okay, it's really weird.

13:26.714 --> 13:29.048
I'm just gonna try it.
No! Tina! It's my medicine!

13:29.049 --> 13:30.950
Just give Tina whatever
your armpits don't finish.

13:30.951 --> 13:33.553
I'm so hungry!
Bob, order a pizza.

13:33.554 --> 13:35.955
Get one with oatmeal, fish oil,
and buttermilk on it.

13:35.956 --> 13:38.925
 So you want
 to become a skilled musician.

13:38.926 --> 13:41.294
Yes. Well, good news,
all it takes is practice...

13:41.295 --> 13:42.395
No...
...discipline...

13:42.396 --> 13:43.663
No.
...and hard work.

13:43.664 --> 13:45.498
No! Okay. Hearing a lot of no's.

13:45.499 --> 13:48.267
Look, I just want to get good
enough to get back into my band,

13:48.268 --> 13:50.269
get discovered, make
it big, throw it all away,

13:50.270 --> 13:52.672
get it back again, and we'll
see what happens from there.

13:52.673 --> 13:55.575
Okay. Let's open up
the workbook.

13:55.576 --> 13:59.312
Work book? Do you hear
how you sound right now?!

13:59.313 --> 14:00.747
Gene, settle down.
Listen to this.

14:04.151 --> 14:07.353
That's a terrible song.
It's not a song. It's scales.

14:07.354 --> 14:08.688
Gross.
It's not gross.

14:08.689 --> 14:10.657
It's gross.
It's scales. It can't be gross.

14:10.658 --> 14:11.824
It's gross.

14:11.825 --> 14:13.426
It's not gross! It's scales!
Well, I'm just sayin',

14:13.427 --> 14:14.927
it could use drums or somethin'.

14:14.928 --> 14:16.429
What?
Nothing.

14:26.807 --> 14:29.642
Again. Again?!
We've been doing this for hours!

14:29.643 --> 14:31.644
You've been doing
it for 45 seconds.

14:31.645 --> 14:33.813
Aah! I can't take it anymore!

14:33.814 --> 14:36.649
Gene, you don't become
a skilled musician overnight.

14:36.650 --> 14:39.052
But that's exactly
what I have to do!

14:39.053 --> 14:41.721
Lenny Destefano's
birthday party is tomorrow!

14:41.722 --> 14:45.058
You're playing Lenny Destefano's
birthday party? I was.

14:45.059 --> 14:46.559
Why don't you try
and book next year

14:46.560 --> 14:48.995
or the year after
that and practice until then?

14:48.996 --> 14:51.397
And see if you can get me on
as your opening act, would ya?

14:51.398 --> 14:54.233
Who am I kidding?

14:54.234 --> 14:56.336
I'm never gonna be
a skilled musician.

14:56.337 --> 14:58.171
I think I'm just gonna go home.

14:58.172 --> 15:01.307
Would it help if
I played you out? Maybe.

15:01.308 --> 15:03.376
♪ He's a-leavin' little early,
but that's okay ♪

15:03.377 --> 15:05.378
♪ He seems real depressed
and a... ♪ Okay, not helping!

15:05.379 --> 15:06.813
What?
Not helping!

15:06.814 --> 15:09.449
All right. It was
a work in progress.

15:09.483 --> 15:11.484
There's my little Genethoven.

15:11.485 --> 15:14.087
How was your first music lesson?
What'd you learn?

15:14.121 --> 15:16.155
I learned
that I don't have what it takes.

15:16.190 --> 15:17.657
What are you talkin' about?

15:17.658 --> 15:18.858
You've got swagger,

15:18.859 --> 15:20.026
you got flare, you got panache.

15:20.027 --> 15:21.461
What else is there?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.629
I'm not getting back in my band
or any band!

15:23.630 --> 15:26.232
I'm never gonna get
to hear one of my songs used

15:26.233 --> 15:28.668
in a Hyundai Elantra commercial!
Never!

15:28.702 --> 15:30.470
Aw, I'd give you a hug, hon,

15:30.471 --> 15:32.472
but I'd get stinky pit
paste all over your head.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.207
Why do I never get that warning?

15:34.208 --> 15:35.975
Time to reapply.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.177
Ugh! Oh, God,
you released the beast!

15:38.178 --> 15:40.246
It smells fine
if you don't breathe.

15:40.247 --> 15:42.715
We got to move, Lin.
It's gonna stink up the whole place.

15:42.716 --> 15:44.717
All right, we're goin' out
to the alley to reapply.

15:44.718 --> 15:46.786
Tina, Louise,
comfort your brother.

15:46.787 --> 15:48.221
There, there.

15:48.222 --> 15:50.390
I know what'll make
you feel better.

15:50.424 --> 15:51.524
Here comes Ticklin' Tina.

15:51.525 --> 15:53.726
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

15:53.727 --> 15:55.395
I don't need to be a musician.

15:55.396 --> 15:57.797
In fact,
I don't need music at all.

15:57.798 --> 15:59.632
Really? What?
Stop looking at me like that,

15:59.633 --> 16:01.801
keyboard! You know I'm right!

16:01.802 --> 16:03.169
What would you do instead?

16:03.203 --> 16:05.204
Mmm. Maybe I'll be a baker.

16:05.205 --> 16:07.106
Or a candlestick maker.

Here! Take this thing
and get rid of it for me!

16:43.277 --> 16:44.777
What are you saying?

16:44.778 --> 16:47.180
I never want to see
or hear from it again.

16:47.181 --> 16:48.681
Burn it.

16:48.682 --> 16:50.516
Gene,
you don't want to do that.

16:50.517 --> 16:53.486
Take it! I have to report
to the Miramar Naval Air Station

16:53.487 --> 16:55.922
in Miramar, California!

16:58.864 --> 17:01.137
Come on out, sweetie.
You been in there all morning.

17:01.138 --> 17:03.139
Gene, come on, we gotta
open up the restaurant.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.175
No, thank you!
I'm fine!

17:05.209 --> 17:06.443
We missed you at breakfast.

17:06.444 --> 17:08.278
We missed
all your funny banana jokes.

17:08.279 --> 17:10.614
That one where you pretend
the banana is your penis.

17:10.615 --> 17:12.615
Eh, don't love that one. Why?

17:12.616 --> 17:15.050
It's a little easy.
Why? What do you mean, "easy"?

17:15.051 --> 17:17.053
He's got other ones.
Like what? Which ones?

17:17.054 --> 17:19.289
He does the banana mustache,
he does Captain Banana...

17:19.290 --> 17:21.625
Oh, yeah. Ooh! I know
what'll get him out.

17:21.626 --> 17:24.060
Who wants to see Mommy's
big hairy pasty pits?

17:24.060 --> 17:25.462
Nah.
Good idea, Lin.

17:25.463 --> 17:26.829
All right, all right.

17:26.830 --> 17:28.098
Nice try from the B-team.

17:28.098 --> 17:29.799
You guys go ahead downstairs.

17:29.834 --> 17:31.601
The A-team will
take it from here.

17:31.602 --> 17:33.203
Gene, we're coming in.

17:33.237 --> 17:34.638
B-team?
All right. We're leaving

17:34.639 --> 17:36.473
but only because we have
to open the restaurant.

17:36.474 --> 17:38.642
And we're not the B team.
No, like in a good way.

17:38.643 --> 17:40.677
Not in a good way.

17:40.678 --> 17:43.446
So, you're, uh,
still done with music, right?

17:43.447 --> 17:45.315
Yes. You haven't
changed your mind?

17:45.349 --> 17:47.484
Nope.
This is what I'm doing now.

17:47.518 --> 17:49.919
Okay. Cool. Oh!
I almost forgot.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.122
What is this?
That's your keyboard.

17:52.123 --> 17:53.723
We burnt it.
Just like you asked.

17:53.758 --> 17:55.825
That's what you wanted, right?

17:55.826 --> 17:57.961
Yes.

We knew you still cared!

18:14.512 --> 18:16.513
And that's why we didn't burn
your keyboard.

18:16.514 --> 18:18.281
What? This isn't my keyboard?

18:18.282 --> 18:20.116
No. We burnt Dad's new socks.

18:20.117 --> 18:21.551
Who does he think he is?

18:21.552 --> 18:23.787
If you want to
see your real keyboard,

18:23.788 --> 18:26.189
put on your burger suit,
do something about that hair,

18:26.190 --> 18:28.124
and come with us.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.193
Come on, Gene, let's play
together, like we used to.

18:30.194 --> 18:33.630
You play the keyboard and we'll
play the cups. Like old times.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.969
No. I can't.
I'm not a real musician.

18:38.970 --> 18:41.371
Well, you're definitely
a real something.

18:41.372 --> 18:44.040
Maybe "musician" just isn't
the right word for you.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.543
Maybe you're a...
musishy.

18:46.544 --> 18:48.211
Come on, Gene.
Just one song.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.547
Yeah. And after that,
if you're still done with music,

18:50.548 --> 18:52.048
we'll really burn this sucker.

18:52.049 --> 18:55.018
Uh...

18:55.052 --> 18:57.053
Mmm... uh... Come on.

Lin,
I think the pit paste worked.

20:06.490 --> 20:09.426
I can't see your rash anymore.
Oh, yeah! The rash is gone!

20:09.427 --> 20:10.994
You can shave.
Yeah...

20:10.995 --> 20:12.595
What? You don't want to shave?

20:12.596 --> 20:14.264
I don't know.
I kind of like 'em now.

20:14.265 --> 20:16.266
My little Harry and Sally. Ugh.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.835
I mean, great.
Armpit hair!

Isn't it almost time
for Lenny's party?

20:30.181 --> 20:33.350
Well, funny story.
Um, after you were invited

20:33.351 --> 20:36.786
to leave the band,
and you reluctantly accepted,

20:36.787 --> 20:38.421
we, um...

20:38.422 --> 20:40.223
It's not fun anymore!

20:40.257 --> 20:41.791
So you're saying you're sorry?

20:41.826 --> 20:43.493
Yeah. Want to get the band

20:43.494 --> 20:45.095
