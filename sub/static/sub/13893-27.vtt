WEBVTT

00:16.064 --> 00:19.224
Dude, we only need a few more for a bingo! Up high!

00:19.324 --> 00:20.844
This is totally gross, you know.

00:20.884 --> 00:23.284
I can't believe Benson made a dead animal bingo card

00:23.284 --> 00:25.024
to force us to pick up road kill.

00:25.024 --> 00:25.754
So what?

00:25.754 --> 00:28.234
We have to pick up roadkill in the park anyway, it's part of our job.

00:28.234 --> 00:30.654
We might as well try to have a little fun while we're doin' it.

00:30.684 --> 00:33.184
Besides, Benson said we could stop once we get a bingo,

00:33.184 --> 00:35.624
so come on man. Up high!

00:36.504 --> 00:38.114
Ugh, fine.

00:38.354 --> 00:40.364
I still think you're enjoying this too much.

00:49.134 --> 00:51.384
Dude, I think we've picked everything up.

00:51.434 --> 00:53.934
Don't worry dude, we're close I can smell it.

00:54.434 --> 00:56.414
Ah, dude, if you're gonna crack one off in the cart,

00:56.414 --> 00:57.704
you could at least warn me!

00:57.704 --> 00:59.494
Dude it's not me - look!

01:02.594 --> 01:04.504
Aw, skunk!

01:04.504 --> 01:05.404
Wait, skunk?

01:06.974 --> 01:07.934
Dude, Bingo!

01:07.964 --> 01:08.634
Bingo?

01:08.634 --> 01:13.264
- Bingo, bingo! - Bingo!

01:16.354 --> 01:17.994
Bingo-

01:24.634 --> 01:26.074
Rigby, you ok?

01:28.934 --> 01:30.284
Watch it, watch it!

01:30.844 --> 01:32.364
What the heck, man?

01:32.364 --> 01:35.204
You guys think you could walk up to a guy in broad daylight

01:35.204 --> 01:36.844
and mug him without him fighting back?

01:36.844 --> 01:39.224
We weren't mugging you! We thought you were dead!

01:39.224 --> 01:41.114
I was taking a nap!

01:41.114 --> 01:42.304
In the middle of the road?

01:42.304 --> 01:44.464
Oh, who are you, Mr. King Sand Man,

01:44.464 --> 01:46.594
telling people where they can and cannot sleep?

01:46.594 --> 01:48.454
Sorry, we thought you were dead.

01:48.454 --> 01:49.644
We were just excited.

01:49.644 --> 01:50.894
We though we got a bingo.

01:50.894 --> 01:53.774
So because you thought I was dead, you thought you got a bingo?

01:53.854 --> 01:55.544
What king of sick game is that?

01:55.544 --> 01:57.144
It's--our boss made us--

01:57.144 --> 02:00.414
well, OK, look, no bingo. No bingo.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.054
Well, how do I get rid of this smell?

02:02.744 --> 02:04.794
You think you just get to turn it off?

02:04.794 --> 02:08.174
No, I'm stuck with it, and now so are you.

02:08.264 --> 02:10.954
Come on dude, don't be a jerk. Tell me how to get rid of this.

02:11.014 --> 02:12.374
Oh, I'm a jerk?

02:14.424 --> 02:16.834
You don't know what I am.

02:16.884 --> 02:20.154
Let's see how you like when you can't turn it off!

02:20.154 --> 02:20.954
Let him go!

02:21.034 --> 02:23.624
Let him go or I'm gonna make you wish you were roadkill!

02:24.984 --> 02:26.414
Now get lost!

02:26.894 --> 02:29.804
You two are disguisting. I'm outta here!

02:29.964 --> 02:32.274
Wait, at least tell me how to get this smell off!

02:32.274 --> 02:35.034
Yeah right. Figure it out for yourself!

02:38.254 --> 02:38.924
What?

02:39.544 --> 02:40.934
What am I gonna do now?

02:40.934 --> 02:41.764
I don't know dude.

02:41.784 --> 02:44.454
But we've got to get that smell off you. It reeks.

02:48.284 --> 02:50.934
Don't tell me about how I smell. I know it reeks!

02:50.934 --> 02:52.594
You don't think I know it reeks?

02:57.304 --> 02:58.324
What was that?

02:58.324 --> 02:59.554
What did that thing do to me?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.744
Dude, we've got to find Skips .

03:02.864 --> 03:04.754
That was a were-skunk.

03:04.754 --> 03:05.494
What?

03:05.494 --> 03:09.104
Yeah. And if you don't get that smell off, you'll turn into one too, you know.

03:09.104 --> 03:10.754
What, what do I do?

03:10.754 --> 03:14.264
This is bad. This isn't regular skunk spray.

03:14.264 --> 03:15.964
You could try taking a shower.

03:15.964 --> 03:18.594
Or if that doesn't work coffee will dehydrate you

03:18.594 --> 03:20.304
and draw some of the smell out, maybe.

03:20.354 --> 03:23.564
Seriously, a shower? Coffee? Come On!

03:25.154 --> 03:27.114
You think you're so smart, don't you?

03:27.114 --> 03:30.664
Oh look at me, I'm Skips, I know everything 'cause I'm so old,

03:30.664 --> 03:33.614
let me tell you how to fix your problems in a really lame way.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.274
Well, you know what I think?

03:36.664 --> 03:41.234
You don't know nothing, You don't know nothing!

03:43.674 --> 03:44.904
Dude, that wasn't me!

03:44.904 --> 03:46.254
Skips, I'm sorry!

03:47.084 --> 03:48.704
Forget it, it's fine

03:48.824 --> 03:51.244
But you better get changed back soon.

03:51.244 --> 03:53.854
Because once the transformation is complete,

03:53.854 --> 03:56.374
you won't wanna change back.

03:58.974 --> 04:00.384
What are you doing here?

04:00.484 --> 04:03.124
There's no way you got a bingo that fast.

04:06.024 --> 04:07.374
What happened?

04:07.424 --> 04:09.104
Rigby got sprayed by a were-skunk.

04:09.124 --> 04:09.974
A what?!

04:10.494 --> 04:12.934
Look, we don't have time. We have to get him cleaned up.

04:13.584 --> 04:14.314
Fine.

04:14.414 --> 04:17.483
But don't think this counts as an excuse to get out of your work.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.803
You still have to fill out that bingo card.

04:23.354 --> 04:24.974
Dude, I looked all over the internet.

04:24.974 --> 04:28.274
We should probably try Skips' coffee idea if the shower doesn't work.

04:29.224 --> 04:31.684
Dude, did it work? Come on, come out.

04:34.714 --> 04:38.834
I used everything, man: the shampoo, the conditioner, the cologne and the deodorant.

04:38.844 --> 04:41.744
Man, I thought for sure the shampoo would work.

04:41.944 --> 04:43.354
Did you lather, rinse and repeat?

04:43.374 --> 04:45.984
Yeah, I lathered, rinsed, and repeated. I used the whole bottle!

04:45.984 --> 04:48.134
What, you think I don't know how to wash my own hair?

04:51.424 --> 04:52.794
Mordecai, I'm sorry!

04:53.594 --> 04:55.704
Just try and take it easy, OK?

04:55.794 --> 04:56.664
I'm sorry.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.844
Look, we should go to the coffee shop .

05:04.054 --> 05:04.944
Just relax.

05:04.944 --> 05:07.244
I'm going to go get you a coffee, OK? Relax.

05:10.734 --> 05:12.584
Hey guys-- gals.

05:13.904 --> 05:15.774
I need a coffee for Rigby - quick.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.494
What's wrong?

05:16.494 --> 05:18.324
He got sprayed by a were-skunk.

05:18.334 --> 05:19.324
Oh, no!

05:19.324 --> 05:20.794
What are you guys doing here, then?

05:20.794 --> 05:23.684
We heard coffee might cure him, but I don't know.

05:23.684 --> 05:25.374
Oh no, poor guy.

05:25.494 --> 05:27.014
I'm going to go take him a coffee.

05:31.014 --> 05:31.894
Hey, Rigby.

05:31.924 --> 05:33.184
It's about time.

05:34.224 --> 05:35.774
Well? Did it work?

05:37.594 --> 05:39.414
Maybe you have to pour it on yourself?

05:40.194 --> 05:41.094
Fine!

05:43.774 --> 05:44.554
Did it work?

05:44.864 --> 05:48.464
No! It was just really hot.

05:49.684 --> 05:51.064
You think this is funny?!

05:53.954 --> 05:55.914
Well, I don't think it's funny.

05:55.914 --> 05:57.354
This is my life you're laughing at.

05:57.354 --> 05:59.114
Rigby, stop. Stop!

06:04.824 --> 06:06.444
Rigby, you're scaring me!

06:10.024 --> 06:12.514
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

06:14.794 --> 06:15.844
Rigby, wait!

06:39.224 --> 06:40.334
Where you at, skunk?

06:45.244 --> 06:46.864
Skunk, come out!

06:46.954 --> 06:47.884
I know you're in there.

06:47.884 --> 06:50.644
What? Oh. It's you.

06:50.974 --> 06:52.394
What are you doing here?

06:52.394 --> 06:54.134
You have to tell me how to get rid of this.

06:54.354 --> 06:55.554
Why would I do that?

06:55.554 --> 06:57.554
I'm a huge jerk, remember?

06:57.714 --> 06:59.194
I'm sorry. You're not a jerk.

06:59.424 --> 07:01.194
Please, just tell me how to stop this.

07:02.264 --> 07:05.284
Thing is, I'm sick of being the only skunk in town.

07:05.594 --> 07:08.084
Always getting dirty looks, people yellin' at ya,

07:08.084 --> 07:11.314
everyone hatin' ya 100% of the time.

07:11.754 --> 07:15.734
Nah, with you as a skunk things won't be so bad.

07:15.734 --> 07:19.554
All that negative attention won't fall just on me.

07:19.554 --> 07:21.554
It'll fall on you, too.

07:21.554 --> 07:25.884
We'll split it, fifty-fifty, partner!

07:25.994 --> 07:27.884
No!

07:31.464 --> 07:33.824
Tell me, tell me how to end this, tell me!

07:36.684 --> 07:38.824
It's pineapple juice!

07:38.824 --> 07:40.594
But it's too late anyway.

07:40.684 --> 07:42.794
The transformation's already started

07:42.994 --> 07:44.154
- partner!

08:08.424 --> 08:09.284
What the heck?

08:14.554 --> 08:15.774
There's the pineapple juice!

08:21.044 --> 08:22.394
Come on, come on!

08:27.994 --> 08:29.974
Ahh... it's not working!

08:32.424 --> 08:36.953
Come on, you didn't think I'd tell ya what the real cure was, did you?

08:37.264 --> 08:39.443
It's not pineapple juice.

08:39.484 --> 08:42.394
I was just stalling ya so you'd run out of time.

08:42.394 --> 08:43.424
Don't worry-

08:43.424 --> 08:47.264
once you're like me, you'll never wanna switch back.

08:52.684 --> 08:54.844
Rigby! Rigby!

08:56.714 --> 08:57.994
Dude, open the door!

08:58.334 --> 09:01.534
It's too late - he's my friend now!

09:02.244 --> 09:04.974
Rigby, I've figured it out - tomato paste.

09:05.644 --> 09:07.244
The cure is tomato paste!

09:53.024 --> 09:55.664
Don't worry, it's almost over,

09:55.774 --> 09:59.714
and then you and I will split the skunkin' duties

09:59.714 --> 10:03.554
at this park for the rest of eternity!

10:13.284 --> 10:14.884
You think you could stop me

10:15.154 --> 10:17.934
from splittin' my pain with your friend?

10:17.934 --> 10:22.824
You can't stop it. You can't stop nothin'!

10:22.974 --> 10:25.934
You're right, I can't stop it. But Rigby can.

10:30.774 --> 10:32.334
Split this.

10:39.714 --> 10:40.514
We did it! Yeah!

10:40.514 --> 10:42.044
Yeah, we did it, yeah!

10:43.734 --> 10:45.514
Thank... you.

10:48.954 --> 10:50.424
He still counts as a skunk, right?

10:50.594 --> 10:51.794
Totally counts as a skunk.

10:53.374 --> 10:57.644
Bingo! Bingo!
