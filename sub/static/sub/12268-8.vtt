11:20.110 --> 11:21.952

20:57.026 --> 21:00.630
I'M GONNA FIGHT FOR MY BOYS
THIS TIME.

21:00.630 --> 21:03.032
FIGHT WHO?

21:03.032 --> 21:04.634
(flames whoosh)

21:04.634 --> 21:06.936
SON OF A BITCH!
GET THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

21:08.938 --> 21:13.042
(hissing)

21:16.776 --> 21:18.578
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, DAD?

21:20.450 --> 21:23.953
ONE MORE TIME.
WHO SENT YOU?

21:23.953 --> 21:25.355
(spits)

21:25.355 --> 21:27.357
(inhales deeply)

21:27.357 --> 21:29.689
(grunts)

21:29.689 --> 21:33.523
WE'LL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES
TO CONSIDER YOUR SITUATION.

21:33.523 --> 21:35.365
(Dmitri, muffled voice) THEN WE
TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE SPECIAL

21:35.365 --> 21:38.468
WHERE MY COMRADE'S WISH
CAN COME TRUE.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.708
(door closes)

21:48.708 --> 21:51.381
(grunts)

21:52.682 --> 21:55.745
(grate clatters)

21:55.745 --> 21:57.547
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

21:57.547 --> 21:59.549
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID
TO COLLEEN.

21:59.549 --> 22:00.720
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.891
AN ALLY.

22:01.891 --> 22:04.554
IF YOU WERE, YOU WOULD'VE
LET ME KILL HIM.

22:04.554 --> 22:07.026
KILLING DMITRI IS NOT GONNA
BRING YOUR SISTER BACK.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.958
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE DOWNING OF FLIGHT 197?

22:08.958 --> 22:11.601
IT HAPPENED A WEEK AFTER
MY SISTER WAS TAKEN.

22:11.601 --> 22:13.963
WHAT ELSE? THERE'S GOTTA BE
A BIGGER CONNECTION HERE.

22:13.963 --> 22:16.506
MY FATHER WORKED
AS A BAGGAGE HANDLER

22:16.506 --> 22:17.667
AT HEATHROW AIRPORT.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.968
HE WORKED THE NIGHT
THE PLANE TOOK OFF.

22:18.968 --> 22:21.911
(pants) THAT'S HOW THEY GOT
THE BOMB ON THE PLANE.

22:21.911 --> 22:23.613
NO, THERE WERE THE RUMORS,
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

22:23.613 --> 22:24.774
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM.

22:24.774 --> 22:26.045
I DIDN'T NEED TO.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.517
THEY USED YOUR FATHER
THE SAME WAY THEY USED MINE.

22:27.517 --> 22:29.849
GO.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.451
(grunts)

22:31.451 --> 22:32.922
(grunts)

22:32.922 --> 22:35.685
MOVE, AND YOU BOTH DIE.

22:35.685 --> 22:37.587
(Aiden grunting)

22:37.587 --> 22:38.958
LOOKS LIKE YOU GET

22:38.958 --> 22:41.891
TO USE THOSE SELF-DEFENSE
CLASSES AFTER ALL.

22:41.891 --> 22:44.864
MAKE YOUR DADDY PROUD.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.043
WE SHOULD BE CALLING
THE COPS.

22:54.043 --> 22:55.845
NO COPS.
JUST HELP ME FIX THE WINDOW.

22:55.845 --> 22:58.107
IT'S CHILLY IN HERE.

22:58.107 --> 22:59.879
HEARD A BUNCH OF PLACES
UP AND DOWN THE DOCK

22:59.879 --> 23:01.411
GOT HIT TONIGHT.

23:01.411 --> 23:04.013
AND ON A HOLIDAY LIKE THIS.

23:04.013 --> 23:07.787
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE WAS
TRYING TO SEND US A MESSAGE.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.420
YOU KNOW, I GOT TWO BOYS
OF MY OWN.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.462
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN ON THESE DOCKS
ALL THE TIME,

23:12.462 --> 23:14.123
ESPECIALLY THE KIDS.

23:14.123 --> 23:16.696
WHERE'S YOUR LITTLE ONE
TONIGHT, CARL? DECLAN, IS IT?

23:16.696 --> 23:17.867
HEY, DON'T YOU
EVER MENTION MY--

23:17.867 --> 23:19.398
DAD, DAD, DON'T. DON'T.

23:21.971 --> 23:23.803
WE'LL PAY.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.004
JACK, WHAT ARE YOU--

23:25.004 --> 23:26.636
WE JUST NEED A COUPLE HOURS
TO GET THE CASH TOGETHER.

23:26.636 --> 23:28.778
BUT WE'LL PAY.
 (clatter)

23:28.778 --> 23:30.109
SMART KID.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.912
I'LL COME BACK IN AN HOUR,
AND WE'LL MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.884
BREAK OUT A BOTTLE
OF SOMETHING.

23:34.884 --> 23:36.946
LET'S CELEBRATE
OUR PARTNERSHIP.

23:36.946 --> 23:38.948
ME--I LIKE
BLUE LABEL SCOTCH.

23:38.948 --> 23:40.990
RICH MAN'S CANDY.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.458
JACK, DON'T EVER,

23:48.458 --> 23:50.630
EVER SPEAK FOR ME AGAIN.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.662
(door closes)

23:52.662 --> 23:54.003
(whirring)

23:54.003 --> 23:56.205
HEY, THE, UM,

23:56.205 --> 23:58.908
THE ACCOUNTANTS
FOUND A PROBLEM.
 (groans)

23:58.908 --> 24:01.911
THEY FOUND THE CAYMAN ACCOUNT
I SET UP FOR YOU IN 2002.

24:01.911 --> 24:04.043
OH.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.115
GOD, THAT WAS SO LONG AGO.

24:06.115 --> 24:08.117
OH, WELL, LET ME--
LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.

24:08.117 --> 24:13.723
IT CONTAINED
NEARLY $500 MILLION.

24:13.723 --> 24:17.527
AND AS OF SIX WEEKS AGO,
IT'S EMPTY.

24:17.527 --> 24:19.959
(clears throat)

24:22.161 --> 24:24.163
I...

24:24.163 --> 24:26.596
IT'S GONE.

24:26.596 --> 24:28.898
BUT I-I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

24:28.898 --> 24:31.541
WHERE IS IT?

24:33.873 --> 24:36.175
SEE, I'M YOUR C.F.O.,

24:36.175 --> 24:37.877
AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME

24:37.877 --> 24:39.679
WHERE NEARLY
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS WENT.

24:41.711 --> 24:43.983
THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.655

DANIEL, HOW GOES
THAT CREATIVE WRITING CLASS

24:50.860 --> 24:52.722
YOU WERE SO EXCITED ABOUT?

24:52.722 --> 24:53.993
I DON'T KNOW.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.065
DAD, DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO READ WHAT I GAVE YOU?

24:56.065 --> 24:57.597
I DID, AND I THINK
YOUR PROFESSOR

24:57.597 --> 24:59.969
WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
TO COMMEND YOUR TALENTS.

24:59.969 --> 25:01.971
IN FACT, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO SEND THEM

25:01.971 --> 25:03.803

25:03.803 --> 25:05.805
THANK YOU.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.908
WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU, DANIEL,

SADLY, NO.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.148
WE NEVER FOUND

 AH.

25:19.148 --> 25:20.850
IT'S A GOOD THING,

KNOWING WHEN TO START A FAMILY
AND WHEN NOT TO.

25:23.923 --> 25:28.057

MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE

25:49.719 --> 25:51.080
IN COMING HERE.

25:53.082 --> 25:54.824
WE SHOULD GO.

WE'LL TELL THE POLICE
THAT HE ATTACKED US,

27:06.956 --> 27:09.058
THAT YOU SHOT HIM
TO PROTECT ME.

27:09.058 --> 27:11.931
NO JURY
WILL EVER CONVICT YOU.

IF YOU DON'T DO THIS,

27:15.304 --> 27:17.306

27:40.960 --> 27:44.433
THE GRAND JURY FAILED
TO INDICT ME,

THOUGH I WAS HARDLY
HAILED AS A HERO.

27:46.936 --> 27:48.938

TO A 6-MONTH

SHE SAW HIM
SNEAK INTO MY ROOM.

28:05.314 --> 28:09.058
AND THE NEXT MORNING,
SHE THREW ME TO THE CURB.

THEY WERE MARRIED.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.058
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:29.058 --> 31:30.219
DAVID CLARKE.

31:30.219 --> 31:31.620
WHAT?

31:33.562 --> 31:36.125
AFTER THE CONVICTION,
I SET UP THE ACCOUNT

31:36.125 --> 31:39.498
SO HIS DAUGHTER COULD GET
WHAT WAS RIGHTFULLY HERS.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.132
AFTER THE CON--
ARE YOU INSANE?

31:43.132 --> 31:45.104
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.205
DAVID WAS INNOCENT.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.906
OKAY, YOU ARE INSANE

31:47.906 --> 31:50.039
IF YOU BELIEVE
THOSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

31:50.039 --> 31:51.680
THINK ABOUT HOW THIS LOOKS,
NOLAN, FOR YOU,

31:51.680 --> 31:53.212
FOR THE COMPANY.

31:53.212 --> 31:57.246
YOU ARE NOLAN ROSS.
THAT NAME MEANS SOMETHING NOW.

31:57.246 --> 31:59.989
THERE WOULD BE NO COMPANY
WITHOUT DAVID,

31:59.989 --> 32:02.291
AND LOOK, I WASN'T ABOUT
TO SCREW OVER HIS DAUGHTER

32:02.291 --> 32:05.324
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH.

32:07.096 --> 32:09.458
OH...

32:09.458 --> 32:13.202
IF YOU DON'T... GET THAT,

32:13.202 --> 32:15.264
THEN I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A FUTURE TOGETHER.

32:15.264 --> 32:16.935
WOW.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.537
UM...

32:18.537 --> 32:20.469
OKAY, YOU...

32:20.469 --> 32:23.472
ARE CHOOSING
A CONVICTED TERRORIST

32:23.472 --> 32:25.114
OVER ME.

32:25.114 --> 32:27.616
NO.

32:27.616 --> 32:31.020
I'M CHOOSING A MAN
THAT TOOK ME AT MY WORD

32:31.020 --> 32:32.521
OVER MY NAME.

32:32.521 --> 32:35.254
AND, UH... YOU'RE FIRED.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.226
WOW.
 AND...

32:37.226 --> 32:39.058
HERE'S YOUR SHARE
OF THE COMPANY.
 OH, NO.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.060
NO, I WANT NO TIES WITH YOU

32:41.060 --> 32:43.162
OR YOUR BLOOD MONEY.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.434
GO TO HELL, NOLAN.

32:45.434 --> 32:48.467
(door opens)

32:48.467 --> 32:49.738
(door closes)

32:59.408 --> 33:01.680
WHY, VICTORIA?

33:01.680 --> 33:04.053
THIS WAS ALL I HAD.

33:04.053 --> 33:06.155
THIS WAS MY LAST CHANCE.

33:06.155 --> 33:09.058
YOU HAD MANY CHANCES
BEFORE THIS ONE.

33:09.058 --> 33:12.061
WHEN MAXWELL DIED,
WE WERE NEARLY PENNILESS.

33:12.061 --> 33:16.065
I SOLD THE HOUSE,
LIQUIDATED MY SAVINGS.

33:16.065 --> 33:17.996
I HAVE NOTHING.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.998
BUT THE FUR ON YOUR BACK?

33:19.998 --> 33:22.101
IT SERVES YOU RIGHT

33:22.101 --> 33:25.134
FOR CHOOSING A PEDOPHILE
OVER YOUR OWN DAUGHTER.

33:28.077 --> 33:31.380
I THOUGHT AT LEAST YOU'D ENJOY
TAKING PITY ON ME.

33:31.380 --> 33:34.012
PITY'S NOT A QUALITY
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.715
I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.587
MM.

33:38.587 --> 33:40.619
WELL...

33:40.619 --> 33:43.192
WE DO HAVE A GOOD NUMBER
OF ROOMS HERE.

33:43.192 --> 33:45.324
PITY, AS YOU SAY,

33:45.324 --> 33:47.156
NONE OF THEM ARE FOR YOU.

33:47.156 --> 33:50.028
YOU VINDICTIVE BITCH.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.101
OH, I LEARNED
FROM THE BEST.

33:58.067 --> 34:00.038
GOOD-BYE, MOTHER.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.072
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT
YOU'LL LAND ON YOUR FEET.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.829
IS THAT DANIEL'S POETRY?

34:20.829 --> 34:23.831
MERELY COPIES, I IMAGINE.

34:23.831 --> 34:26.195
WELL, SURELY,
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

34:26.195 --> 34:29.237
OH, ON THE CONTRARY.

34:29.237 --> 34:30.839
"WE SPEAK IN HUSHED VOICES,

34:30.839 --> 34:34.342
"SO AS NOT TO WAKE
OUR MEMORIES,

34:34.342 --> 34:35.674
"THE THINGS WE'VE DONE,

34:35.674 --> 34:37.176
"THE THINGS
WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO,

34:37.176 --> 34:40.279
"FOR FEAR
OF BREAKING THE CYCLE,

34:40.279 --> 34:43.851
"HOW FIERCE WE WERE
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG,

34:43.851 --> 34:49.257
WHEN WE WERE UNAFRAID
OF COMING UNHINGED."

34:49.257 --> 34:51.290
(paper rustles)

34:51.290 --> 34:54.663
IT'S FOR HIS OWN GOOD,
REALLY.

34:54.663 --> 34:56.165
YOU KNOW,
I'LL HAVE SOME PUBLISHERS

34:56.165 --> 34:57.826
SEND DANIEL
COURTEOUS REJECTIONS,

34:57.826 --> 34:59.798
AND OUR SON WILL GO ON

34:59.798 --> 35:01.600
TO TAKE HIS PLACE
AT THE HEAD OF GRAYSON GLOBAL,

35:01.600 --> 35:02.831
WHERE HE BELONGS.

35:02.831 --> 35:05.774
"FOR FEAR
OF BREAKING THE CYCLE."

35:05.774 --> 35:08.207
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY DID
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

35:08.207 --> 35:11.510
I JUST WIRED MR. GREEVY
A SIZEABLE SUM,

35:11.510 --> 35:13.142
AND HE THANKED US
FOR GIVING HIM

35:13.142 --> 35:14.283
"THE ROLE OF HIS LIFETIME."

35:21.150 --> 35:23.422
WAS IT WORTH IT?

35:23.422 --> 35:24.653
HMM?

35:24.653 --> 35:26.795
STAGING THEIR RUN-IN
ON THE CRUISE

35:26.795 --> 35:30.529
AND ORCHESTRATING
YOUR MOTHER'S DEMISE?

35:30.529 --> 35:33.632
HAS THE DARKNESS
FINALLY BEEN LIFTED?

35:36.505 --> 35:40.138
ASK ME TOMORROW.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.141
(boat horn blowing in distance)

35:44.773 --> 35:48.347
GLAD YOU CAME
TO YOUR SENSES, PORTER.

35:50.419 --> 35:53.422
TAKE IT, AND DON'T EVER
THREATEN MY KIDS AGAIN.

35:53.422 --> 35:55.424
YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SHARE

35:55.424 --> 36:00.259
YOUR NEWFOUND PEACE OF MIND
WITH THE REST OF YOUR PALS

36:00.259 --> 36:01.860
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.693
FOR SOME, IT ALREADY IS.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.496
(grunts)

36:09.698 --> 36:12.241
(grunts)
 MATT, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

36:12.241 --> 36:15.173
GUTTER RAT PUT MY LITTLE GIRL
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.905
HIT AND RUN RIGHT OUTSIDE
MY FRONT DOOR.

36:18.247 --> 36:19.408
GIVE ME THE GUN.

36:19.408 --> 36:20.879
IT BELONGS TO YOU ANYWAY.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.751
I FOLLOWED HIM DOWN HERE.

36:22.751 --> 36:25.254
BROKE IN AND STOLE IT
FROM BEHIND YOUR BAR.

36:25.254 --> 36:26.855
I'M SORRY.

36:26.855 --> 36:30.519
BUT RYAN HAD IT COMING TO HIM.
YOU KNOW THAT.

36:30.519 --> 36:32.891
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER,
RIGHT?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.663
(Jack) DAD?!

36:34.663 --> 36:35.964
WAIT HERE.

36:41.970 --> 36:44.703
(motor starts)

36:46.835 --> 36:48.277
MR. DUNCAN.

36:48.277 --> 36:49.938
HEY... JACK.

36:49.938 --> 36:51.310
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

36:51.310 --> 36:53.612
WHAT'S GOING ON?
THAT SOUNDED LIKE--

36:53.612 --> 36:55.314
ENGINE BACKFIRED.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.745
JUST SHOWING MATT
YOUR NEW VESSEL.

36:56.745 --> 36:58.287
THAT'S A HELL OF A BOAT.

36:58.287 --> 36:59.918
YEAH.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.490
HEY, JACK, WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK INSIDE?

37:01.490 --> 37:02.651
IT'S FREEZING OUT.

37:02.651 --> 37:03.992
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

37:03.992 --> 37:05.354
YOU COMING?

37:05.354 --> 37:06.895
YEAH, RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

37:19.308 --> 37:21.810
IS THIS YOUR FATHER?

37:21.810 --> 37:23.972
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

37:27.916 --> 37:30.749
HE WAS KIND...

37:30.749 --> 37:32.681
GENEROUS,

37:32.681 --> 37:35.324
FUNNY... (chuckles)

37:36.925 --> 37:39.688
HUMBLE BUT STRONG.

37:42.891 --> 37:46.795
HE WOULD'VE DIED FOR ME.

37:46.795 --> 37:48.397
(sets down frame)

37:48.397 --> 37:50.499
LIKE MY SISTER.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.543
SHE DIDN'T DESERVE
WHAT SHE GOT.

37:54.543 --> 37:56.605
IF YOUR SENSEI WILL HAVE ME,

37:56.605 --> 37:58.647
I WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO SAVE HER.

37:58.647 --> 38:01.310
WHAT IF SHE CAN'T BE SAVED?

38:01.310 --> 38:02.811
THEN I WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO PUNISH

38:02.811 --> 38:05.454
EVERY PERSON
THAT HELPED DESTROY HER...

38:05.454 --> 38:08.687
SO THAT NO FAMILY HAS TO
SUFFER THE WAY THAT MINE...

38:09.888 --> 38:13.792
THAT WAY
THAT OUR FAMILIES SUFFERED.

38:19.568 --> 38:21.670
IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME
SIX YEARS AGO

38:21.670 --> 38:24.903
THAT I'D BE HERE...

38:24.903 --> 38:25.874
(kisses)
 (chuckles)

38:25.874 --> 38:27.035
IN THIS BED...
(kisses)

38:27.035 --> 38:29.037
WITH YOU... (kisses)

38:29.037 --> 38:31.840
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE BELIEVED IT.

38:44.393 --> 38:47.996
YOU FOUGHT FOR ME
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

38:47.996 --> 38:49.898
AND SOMEHOW

38:49.898 --> 38:52.561
YOU CONVINCED TAKEDA
TO TAKE ME ON.

38:52.561 --> 38:53.902
(laughs)

38:53.902 --> 38:54.863
I BLACKMAILED HIM.

38:54.863 --> 38:56.405
(laughs)

38:56.405 --> 38:58.907
TOLD HIM IT WAS BOTH OF US
OR NEITHER.

38:58.907 --> 39:00.639
(chuckles)

39:00.639 --> 39:02.411
WELL, IT MAKES YOU WONDER,

39:02.411 --> 39:03.572
A GUY THAT SMART--

39:03.572 --> 39:06.344
MAYBE THIS WAS TAKEDA'S PLAN
ALL ALONG.

39:10.619 --> 39:13.922
YOU BETTER NOT
DISAPPEAR ON ME AGAIN.

39:13.922 --> 39:17.526
I WON'T, AMANDA.

39:27.936 --> 39:29.868
♪♪♪

39:29.868 --> 39:31.470
(man) THANKS, MAN.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.642
YOU GET YOUR BROTHER'S BOAT
ALL TIED UP?

39:33.642 --> 39:35.944
YEAH.
 (door closes)

39:35.944 --> 39:37.946
WELL, THANKS AGAIN
FOR LETTING US USE YOUR SLIP

39:37.946 --> 39:39.948
TO BRING THE BOOZE IN.

39:39.948 --> 39:42.851
YEAH, I MEAN, IT SHOULD
SAVE US SOME MONEY, RIGHT?

39:42.851 --> 39:44.983
WHICH WE COULD USE
TO SPRUCE UP THE PLACE.

39:44.983 --> 39:48.817
MAYBE GET PEOPLE ORDERING THIS
INSTEAD OF THE USUAL SWILL.

39:48.817 --> 39:50.959
THAT'S BLUE LABEL.
IT'S EXPENSIVE.

39:50.959 --> 39:52.891
YEAH. MY POP'S DRINK.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.063
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE USED TO CALL IT?

39:56.825 --> 39:59.428
RICH MAN'S CANDY.

40:03.932 --> 40:05.904
ALL RIGHT.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.608
(phone rings)

40:09.608 --> 40:11.940
(switch clicks)
 (ring)

40:11.940 --> 40:13.111
(beep)

40:13.111 --> 40:14.713
HELLO?

40:14.713 --> 40:16.945
(Daniel)
Is this Marco Romero?

40:16.945 --> 40:19.047
WHO IS THIS? DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

40:19.047 --> 40:21.820
OH, IT'S LATE.
MY APOLOGIES.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.753
My name's Daniel Grayson
with Grayson Global.

40:24.753 --> 40:27.596
I HAVE A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
FOR YOU--

40:27.596 --> 40:29.157
ONE THAT INVOLVES NOLCORP.

40:29.157 --> 40:32.000
I'M LISTENING.

40:33.902 --> 40:36.505
AGE-OLD CURE...

40:36.505 --> 40:38.066
FOR ANXIETY.

40:38.066 --> 40:40.539
MM.
WELL, I'M QUITE CERTAIN

40:40.539 --> 40:42.711
THIS WON'T BRING ME
THE SOLACE I NEED,

40:42.711 --> 40:46.174
NOW THAT DANIEL
HAS MADE HIMSELF A TARGET.

40:46.174 --> 40:49.047
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME
PROTECT OUR SON.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.579
WELL, THEN
WE HAVE TO BLOCK HIM

40:50.579 --> 40:51.920
FROM TAKING CONTROL
OF THE BOARD,

40:51.920 --> 40:53.051
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.054
ALL RIGHT.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.926
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THE DAY

40:57.926 --> 40:59.758
WHERE I WOULDN'T WANT HIM
TO HAVE THE JOB.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.159
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE

41:01.159 --> 41:03.061
SO MANY THINGS
THAT HAVE COME TO PASS,

41:03.061 --> 41:04.933
BUT HERE WE ARE.

41:04.933 --> 41:08.166
PERHAPS DANIEL SHOULD'VE BEEN
A POET AFTER ALL.

41:08.166 --> 41:10.468
(sighs)

41:16.174 --> 41:19.177
(footsteps approach)

41:20.609 --> 41:23.912
WHERE'D YOU
SNEAK OFF TO?

41:26.985 --> 41:28.957
I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING

41:28.957 --> 41:32.861
SINCE YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
ANYTIME SOON.

41:35.524 --> 41:37.025
(chuckles)

41:40.899 --> 41:42.671
EVERYTHING ABOUT
MY FATHER'S CONSPIRACY

41:42.671 --> 41:45.073
IS IN THIS BOX.

41:47.035 --> 41:49.738
EVERYTHING...

41:49.738 --> 41:52.040
ABOUT THE GIRL
I LEFT BEHIND

41:52.040 --> 41:55.043
WHEN I STARTED
ON ALL OF THIS.

41:55.043 --> 41:56.985
(handles rattle)

41:56.985 --> 42:00.518
(exhales)

42:00.518 --> 42:02.921
GOD, IT FEELS LIKE
A LIFETIME AGO.

42:04.893 --> 42:06.555
FOR ME, TOO.

42:16.935 --> 42:19.267
DOUBLE INFINITY.

42:19.267 --> 42:21.139
(huffs)

42:23.872 --> 42:27.846
A JOURNEY WITH NO END.
