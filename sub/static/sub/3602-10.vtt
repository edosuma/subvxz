15:51.660 --> 15:53.321
McHENRY: Let's go crush it.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.779
Hello. What's up?

15:57.874 --> 15:58.863
Hey.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.664
Oh, I don't know what
we'd do without you, Hiro.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.665
You have such an amazing
attitude.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.542
I have gift for you.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.302
Happy birthday.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.050
Oh.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.433
A Japanese phrase book.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.391
I love it.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.640
Oh, now we can understand
each other better.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.898
Maybe you visit Japan
very soon.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.193
Get out of Midland, far away.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.233
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

16:38.165 --> 16:40.281
You speak Japanese
very quickly.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.249
Lately, I've just been able
to remember everything.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.374
You have power.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.830
Big memory.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.040
It will only get stronger
in the future.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.459
The future.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.679
Right. I keep forgetting
that's where you come from.

16:55.765 --> 16:56.891
You don't believe me?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.636
I bend time and space.

16:58.727 --> 16:59.933
Oh, yeah,
of course you do.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.683
Charlie, honey,
your order's up.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.863
Hey. Where'd these
come from?

17:13.116 --> 17:15.027
Flower store.
Two blocks from here.

17:15.619 --> 17:16.779
Funny.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.988
Oh, Oh, hang on.
I have an order up.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.989
Already finished.

17:26.463 --> 17:29.455
Lynnette, you have got to
see this.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.335
Hiro's a magician.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.213
Oh, no. It's...
It's not a trick.

17:36.806 --> 17:39.263
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

17:41.353 --> 17:45.517
A very, very bad man is
going to come here and...

17:51.696 --> 17:55.439
Tomorrow the swallow
will slay the dragon.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.750
Having a drink
with your sister?

18:10.840 --> 18:11.829
Thinking about it.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.965
Used to be,
I couldn't go an hour
without missing Jessica.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.809
It's important not to forget.

18:31.695 --> 18:33.105
Hal is back.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.947
He came to one of my meetings.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.945
He wants to meet you
and Micah.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.028
He won't meet anybody
unless you want him to.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.785
He's got money.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.371
He really could...
He could help with tuition,

18:49.879 --> 18:51.835
and get Micah into
that private school.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.457
If you want to have Hal over,
let's have him
over for dinner.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.053
We can all say a prayer
for Jessica.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.648
My brother Peter, the hospice
nurse, can you believe it?
It's just...

19:11.735 --> 19:13.350
Oh, it's a perfect fit.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.484
He's selfless and empathic.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.154
He's self-centered
and righteous. Self-righteous.

19:18.241 --> 19:19.822
He's a hell of a lot nicer
than you.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.324
He can afford to be.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.494
He hasn't been under
as much scrutiny.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.823
My dad did what he had to do
to take care of this family,

19:27.959 --> 19:30.792
and that's something
that Peter is never going
to understand.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.536
And you do?

19:32.922 --> 19:34.833
It's my responsibility.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.840
It's my inherited birthright.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.719
I didn't ask to be
dad's favorite.

19:42.599 --> 19:46.933
I never asked to be loved more
than Peter, but that's just
the reality.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.931
What does this guy want?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.229
(CRASHING)

20:13.463 --> 20:14.543
Nathan!

20:14.631 --> 20:15.791
Heidi!

20:16.132 --> 20:17.588
Nathan!

20:17.675 --> 20:19.211
(HEIDI SCREAMING)

20:25.975 --> 20:26.964
Heidi!

20:30.313 --> 20:32.520
(PHONE RINGING)

20:38.988 --> 20:40.148
Hello?

20:45.412 --> 20:46.492
Hey.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.536
How is she?

20:48.623 --> 20:51.239
She's been in surgery
for 10 hours.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.950
It's something with her back,
her spine.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.381
I should probably call Morn.
She's got the kids.
It's what Heidi would do.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.080
Can I have your phone?
Yeah.

21:00.885 --> 21:01.920
You're not hurt?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.137
No.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.132
I landed 300 feet
away from the wreck.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.009
Couldn't tell you how
I got there.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.014
Couldn't tell you much of
anything at this point.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.388
Listen, look, yeah,
that's a bad cut.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.639
You need to lie down.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.725
No, not until
Heidi's all right.

21:14.816 --> 21:15.805
Just gonna sit.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.185
Do you remember the other car?

21:21.030 --> 21:21.985
What?

21:22.073 --> 21:23.313
In the accident.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.111
Who told you that?

21:30.206 --> 21:31.457
Who told you that?

21:31.541 --> 21:33.532
I had a dream right before
you called.

21:34.002 --> 21:38.462
My wife's in surgery
and you're dreaming.
That's great.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.210
There was another car,
wasn't there?

21:43.553 --> 21:44.713
Nathan?

21:47.891 --> 21:49.552
Wasn't there?

21:51.895 --> 21:52.884
Yeah.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.762
It was Linderman's guys.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.224
Must have found out
about the D.A.'s plans.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.817
It's my fault for
even considering it.
Hey! Hey!

22:00.904 --> 22:02.314
Taking them on.
Look at me. Look at me.

22:02.405 --> 22:05.147
This is... This is not your
fault. This is dad's fault,
okay?

22:05.283 --> 22:06.523
And you know...

22:06.618 --> 22:08.233
You know that this is not
gonna end.

22:08.745 --> 22:09.780
If...

22:10.997 --> 22:13.864
If I agree to take the D.A.'s
case will you give
a deposition?

22:15.585 --> 22:16.665
Huh?
Yeah.

22:17.879 --> 22:19.369
Against your father?

22:19.464 --> 22:20.670
Mr. Petrelli?

22:20.757 --> 22:21.917
Yes?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.043
Please.

22:51.579 --> 22:52.819
They did it!

22:53.873 --> 22:57.161
See? The swallows slay
the dragons.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.377
"The Tokyo Swallows defeated
the Chunichi Dragons yesterday

23:01.464 --> 23:03.921
"with a surprising rally
with two out in the ninth."

23:04.300 --> 23:05.881
What? What is this?
BasebaH?

23:06.094 --> 23:08.710
You read Japanese flawless
in one day.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.842
You have power.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.719
I have power, too.

23:14.686 --> 23:15.721
Okay.

23:15.812 --> 23:18.895
So because you knew this
baseball was going to win,

23:19.274 --> 23:21.265
I'm supposed to believe
you're from the future.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.818
There is an ancient
Japanese tradition. Origami.

23:26.614 --> 23:27.649
Folding paper.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.025
I read about that.

23:29.450 --> 23:32.817
Yeah, it says if a person
can fold 1000 cranes,
you'll be granted one wish.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.072
Yes.

23:48.511 --> 23:49.842
How did you...

23:59.856 --> 24:01.392
A trip to Japan?

24:01.524 --> 24:04.812
I don't care if you
don't believe me,
just...

24:05.903 --> 24:07.939
Please tell me you'll go.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.316
Only one ticket?

24:17.749 --> 24:19.785
Just in case you said yes.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.465
Why do you repair watches,
Gabriel?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.711
My father didn't really
give me a choice.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.135
Yes, but why not do
what you want to do?
Why not change?

24:37.060 --> 24:41.804
You use a phrase in your book.
Evolutionary imperative.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.138
That which we are
destined to do.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.474
Sea turtles die on
the same exact beach
where they were born.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.734
Lions slaughter gazelles.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.607
Spiders eat their young.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.072
They don't want to,
they have to.

24:53.910 --> 24:57.277
Well, the good news
is you're healthy.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.497
You mean normal?

25:01.876 --> 25:02.991
What? There are still
no signs?

25:03.086 --> 25:04.075
No.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.744
Well, maybe tomorrow.
We're still going to this
CT scan, right?

25:06.923 --> 25:10.336
I think we should prepare
for the possibility that
I may have been wrong.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.209
You may not have
a special ability.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.003
I am so close.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.255
I can feel it.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.511
You came to me.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.259
I am on your list.

25:21.396 --> 25:23.978
These tests aren't
100 percent.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.187
Don't give up on me.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.560
There are other opportunities
I need to focus on.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.605
Oh, what, these people?
Huh?

25:29.987 --> 25:31.443
They're important? This guy?

25:31.572 --> 25:33.858
Brian Davis,
you think he's telekinetic?

25:33.950 --> 25:37.738
Move things with his mind?
Or are you just going to
toss him aside, too?

25:38.121 --> 25:40.282
You'd better leave now,
Mr. Gray.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.300
(HAL LAUGHING)

26:03.062 --> 26:04.097
Wow.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.059
That's a very
generous gift, Hal.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.891
Oh, it's amortized over
10 birthdays.

26:10.319 --> 26:12.275
Well, then, you skimped.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.195
Thanks, Grandpa.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.693
It's my pleasure,
young man.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.116
Now, go break the Internet
in half or something.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.952
If I could buy stock in that
kid right now...

26:25.084 --> 26:27.826
I wish his teachers saw
it that way.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.878
We want to move him into
a private school.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.672
It's just, you know,
we're trying to
figure out the details.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.007
Details?

26:36.345 --> 26:40.179
If you're trying to ask me for
something, it's already yours.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.884
It's a man's God-given right
to dote on his grandson.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.727
Thank you.

26:47.315 --> 26:48.976
It'd make a really big
difference for us.

26:51.235 --> 26:53.351
You know, I feel lucky that
you let me through the door

26:53.446 --> 26:55.357
after all the things
I've done.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.277
Stop saying that.
You didn't do anything.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.785
Why do you keep doing that?

27:01.037 --> 27:02.493
Doing what?

27:03.206 --> 27:06.164
You... You're only as
sick as your secrets, Nicole.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.576
I know the mantras, Hal.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.048
I've been reciting them
for over a year.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.054
Well, I'm...

27:19.263 --> 27:21.879
I guess I'll go see what
the boy's up to now.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.220
You are doing great.

27:34.028 --> 27:37.270
What the hell is this?
You've tom the whole damn
computer apart!

27:37.365 --> 27:39.572
That computer cost $2000.

27:39.659 --> 27:40.694
NIKI: Hey.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.491
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

27:42.578 --> 27:43.829
NIKI: You okay?

27:46.374 --> 27:48.581
I have no business being here.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.912
Then why did you bother?

27:52.630 --> 27:55.747
I owe you more than
an apology can ever do.

27:55.925 --> 27:56.914
What am I supposed to
do with this?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.465
I don't know.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.753
Make your life easier,
I don't care how, Okay?

28:03.349 --> 28:06.637
What did you do that was so
bad that I can't have
my father back?

28:07.728 --> 28:10.105
You really don't
remember, do you?

28:21.868 --> 28:24.200
So, what's going to happen
to my Claire?

28:24.328 --> 28:27.912
How is this genetic
abnormality going to
affect her?

28:28.291 --> 28:31.579
I don't know.
It's possible that nothing
might ever happen.

28:31.752 --> 28:34.368
It's possible.
I might be wrong.

28:35.423 --> 28:36.788
Where did you find
this picture?

28:36.883 --> 28:38.498
CHANDRA: Union Wells
High School website.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.134
She's growing up so
quickly now.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.592
Couldn't do anything
to stop it.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.851
You cannot,
try as you might.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.262
Do you have a daughter?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.225
How old is she?

28:54.317 --> 28:56.228
She was five.

28:59.322 --> 29:00.277
MR. BENNET: I'm so sorry.

29:00.364 --> 29:06.610
Mutations are mostly
cancers or diseases meant
to eliminate a species.

29:07.330 --> 29:11.073
Shanti had a genetic anomaly,
and that was the portal
into my research.

29:11.167 --> 29:14.785
My hope is that no one
will suffer as she did.

29:15.171 --> 29:18.629
If you do figure this out,
what happens then?

29:19.842 --> 29:21.798
We can change the world.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.506
Give people hope
for the future.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.929
That is your daughter's
desﬂny.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.842
I'd very much like to
meet her.

29:31.479 --> 29:35.643
You can see how that might be
a problem for my family.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.769
Yes, of course.

29:38.861 --> 29:41.523
Let... Let me think on this,
on the best way to proceed.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.906
Well, I appreciate you coming,
Mr. Bennet.

29:46.077 --> 29:47.817
It was educational.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.967
You do remember.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.766
Oh, how could I forget?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.726
Nicole!
Not Niki.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.604
It's me, Daddy.
Jessica.

30:23.823 --> 30:27.156
The daughter that you threw
beer bottles at, the daughter
that you choked,

30:28.244 --> 30:29.233
the daughter
that you killed.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.317
I didn't kill anyone.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.575
No, it was an accident.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.623
They left Niki with you
to be your punching bag.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.576
I came to apologize,
Nicole.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.660
Apologize?

30:39.797 --> 30:42.038
You don't apologize to Nicole.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.003
You apologize to me.

30:48.139 --> 30:50.972
Niki doesn't remember,
but I do.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.216
Someone had to be there
to protect her.

30:54.937 --> 30:57.223
I remember the stink
of alcohol on your breath.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.439
I took every punch so that
she wouldn't have to.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.437
You are not Jessica.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.311
You have no idea who I am.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.114
Nicole, you need help.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.445
You're right. She does.

31:14.832 --> 31:18.791
I thought she had learned
to protect herself,
but no such luck.

31:20.337 --> 31:23.625
You're going to go away
and never come back.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.602
Cheerleading, huh?

31:45.488 --> 31:46.477
What do you think?

31:46.572 --> 31:50.156
I think I can't wait
to go to my first game.

31:52.953 --> 31:58.493
Ah, well, you might be getting
a little bit old for the bears
from around the world, but...

31:58.584 --> 31:59.573
No, I'm not.

31:59.668 --> 32:00.703
No?

32:00.795 --> 32:01.750
I love my bear.

32:01.837 --> 32:02.917
Aw.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.291
Am I a terrible person?

32:08.385 --> 32:09.636
What are you talking about?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.506
I want to be a cheerleader.

32:11.972 --> 32:15.100
I mean I've worked hard to
be a cheerleader, but...

32:15.392 --> 32:17.223
Sometimes Jackie can just
be a...

32:17.311 --> 32:18.426
A bitch?

32:21.023 --> 32:22.888
Yeah, a bitch.

32:23.359 --> 32:26.647
No, it's your actions
that make you good or
bad. Cheerleader or not.

32:27.905 --> 32:30.191
Let's take a look at
that hand.

32:30.950 --> 32:34.192
The pain went away, but I
think it's still kind of...

32:37.206 --> 32:39.197
Well, that's healed
really nicely.

32:45.548 --> 32:46.958
Hey, baby.

32:51.345 --> 32:52.460
You hungry?

32:53.264 --> 32:56.222
Thought I'd make some eggs,
carbonara style.

32:57.101 --> 32:58.887
Does that sound good?

32:59.895 --> 33:01.635
I didn't pass again.

33:03.107 --> 33:04.643
You studied so hard.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.315
It's not about the answers,
Jan. I know all the answers.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.359
I don't know why you don't
just tell them the truth.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.858
Yeah, I'll just waltz in there
and tell them that
I can barely read.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.318
Half the words I see
backwards. There's a good
career move.

33:16.787 --> 33:17.822
My baby.

33:17.913 --> 33:18.902
Don't.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.321
Come on.

33:21.750 --> 33:28.246
A little morning sex,
some eggs, and everything is
gonna seem so much better.

33:28.883 --> 33:30.464
How can you want
to kiss me?

33:30.551 --> 33:32.416
You're my hero.
Don't you know that?

33:34.180 --> 33:38.514
Hey. You are
everything that
I want.

33:43.397 --> 33:47.766
I'm your hero.
I'm your hero.

33:48.569 --> 33:49.854
Look at me.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.937
Eleven years and I am still
directing traffic.

34:05.127 --> 34:07.459
Hey. I'm ready to give
the deposition.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.754
There isn't going to be one.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.752
What are you talking about?

34:12.968 --> 34:16.131
You can't back out now.
We've got to tell the DA
everything about Linderman,

34:16.222 --> 34:17.462
about Dad, all of it.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.255
Dad's dead.

34:22.102 --> 34:23.558
He had a heart attack
this morning.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.766
Just take comfort in the fact
that he didn't know his sons

34:29.860 --> 34:31.771
were about to stab him
in the back.

34:40.329 --> 34:41.364
Charlie! Charlie!

34:41.455 --> 34:45.164
Twenty-four-hour samurai film
festival at the Drafthouse
in Austin.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.240
Austin?

34:46.669 --> 34:48.500
That's over 300 miles away.

34:48.629 --> 34:53.293
We can make it in time to see
Yojimbo, Seven Samurai
and Hidden Fortress.

34:53.509 --> 34:56.125
It'd be perfect for
our trip to Japan.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.419
You still do want to go?

35:00.891 --> 35:06.102
Yeah. Oh, yeah, no,
it's not that. It's just...
Ever since I met you,

35:06.855 --> 35:09.562
I don't know,
you just made me so happy.

35:10.693 --> 35:12.274
You make me happy, too.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.522
Well, it's more than that.

35:15.531 --> 35:17.692
I don't let people get
very close.

35:22.705 --> 35:27.369
There's a blood clot in
my brain, inches away
from an aneurysm.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.085
I'm dying.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.082
But I'm supposed
to save you.

35:36.844 --> 35:38.050
You did.

35:38.554 --> 35:39.794
You did.

35:40.014 --> 35:42.721
Before you got here
I'd decided to give up.

35:43.726 --> 35:48.470
But you have made me feel
more alive and more full of

35:48.564 --> 35:50.805
joy than I could have
ever imagined.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.190
Hiro...

(PEOPLE CHANTING)

36:15.466 --> 36:16.501
No.

Charlie? Charlie? Charlie?

36:23.557 --> 36:25.673
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

37:14.608 --> 37:15.723
Can I help you?

37:15.818 --> 37:17.809
Yeah. Uh, somebody
called me.

37:18.529 --> 37:20.440
My name is Brian Davis.

37:25.786 --> 37:27.447
Yes, I called you.

37:28.497 --> 37:29.907
My name is...

37:35.212 --> 37:36.418
My name is Sylar.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.425
Gabriel Sylar.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.019
That's incredible.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.900
Can you make it go away?

38:04.283 --> 38:05.864
Why would you want
to do that?

38:06.118 --> 38:09.326
I... I don't know
what this is,
or who I might hurt.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.699
I... I don't want it.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.666
You're broken.

38:16.837 --> 38:17.917
What?

38:19.715 --> 38:22.377
Suresh was right.
It's so clear now.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.256
How it all works, pieces
fitting together.
It is in the brain.

38:26.513 --> 38:28.128
So, you can help.

38:29.683 --> 38:33.050
Don't worry, Brian.
I can fix it.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.227
It's an evolutionary
imperative.

38:44.573 --> 38:47.656
Whatever bad you've done in
the past, it's over.

38:48.952 --> 38:54.993
You have a rare opportunity
to start again, to rewrite
the past, to do better.

38:55.959 --> 39:00.419
But if you're not interested
we could just put you back
in your old life.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.956
Odds are you'd be
dead in a week.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.586
What do you want me to do?

39:10.516 --> 39:13.804
There's a professor.
Dr. Suresh.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.888
He has a list of names.

39:16.897 --> 39:20.355
You're going to get
Claire Bennet's name
off that list.

39:35.832 --> 39:36.821
(GLASS SHATTERING)

39:39.336 --> 39:40.792
I'm sorry about the glass.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.621
It's just glass.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.301
About the other day,
I should've behaved myself.

39:51.098 --> 39:52.634
That was uncalled for.
I'm sorry.

39:52.724 --> 39:57.434
You were angry. A man can say
and do the most awful things
when he's angry.

39:57.771 --> 40:01.013
Well, I'm different now.
I feel I've been given
a chance to start over.

40:02.234 --> 40:05.271
A new life, new identity,
a new purpose.

40:07.155 --> 40:11.865
I came halfway around
the world looking for proof,
and I threw him out the door.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.823
No one returns my
phone calls anymore.
They all think I'm insane.

40:16.164 --> 40:17.370
I don't.

40:18.166 --> 40:23.832
These people are all out there
waiting to be told that
they are important,

40:24.131 --> 40:27.339
waiting to unlock their
true potential. I know it.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.591
I can feel them.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.338
We'll find them together.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.220
We are the future.

40:52.492 --> 40:53.948
Hiro?

40:57.372 --> 40:58.361
Hiro!

41:00.083 --> 41:01.789
(SPEAKING IN JAPANESE)

41:50.342 --> 41:54.255
This list... You found them.

41:55.097 --> 41:57.053
MOH/NDER: These people...

41:58.058 --> 42:03.974
Their future is written on
their DNA just as the past
it seems is written in stone.

42:04.314 --> 42:06.805
I have something
I have to tell you.

42:07.984 --> 42:10.771
MOH/NDER: Was the die cast
from the very beginning?

42:12.322 --> 42:15.906
Or is it in our own hands
to alter the course
of destiny?

42:16.118 --> 42:20.532
Of all our abilities,
it is free will that
truly makes us unique.

42:22.124 --> 42:25.992
With it we have a tiny but
potent chance to deny fate.

42:27.295 --> 42:32.130
And only with it can we find
our way back to being human.

42:33.260 --> 42:34.249
(GUN FIRING)

42:40.434 --> 42:41.799
I loved her.
