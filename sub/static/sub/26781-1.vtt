02:37.866 --> 02:40.285
Toiletries--

02:41.369 --> 02:42.579
Laptop--

02:43.538 --> 02:44.873
Bare essentials--

02:45.707 --> 02:47.500
Anthing else--

02:47.500 --> 02:49.794
ss.ss,ss,ss,ss,ssssss.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.298
Uhhh.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.969
Numbing anxiety to the point
where it feels hard to breathe.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.849
So how many
people are going to be there?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.142
I don't know--

03:04.142 --> 03:04.976
A couple.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.061
A couple not a few?

03:08.730 --> 03:09.647
What's the difference?

03:09.647 --> 03:11.524
; Oh, okay, no no no, don't
play that game with me--

03:11.524 --> 03:12.901
You know there's a
difference--

03:13.109 --> 03:15.028
Is it a "couple". Or a
"few"?

03:16.487 --> 03:17.488
A few.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.783
A few, okay. So that's
including us.

03:21.826 --> 03:22.744
I don't know.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.704
What do you mean you don't know?
 Don't lie to me.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.497
I'm not lying--

03:26.789 --> 03:27.790
Don't start.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.667
I'm not starting anything--

03:32.170 --> 03:33.087
How many people?

03:33.588 --> 03:34.088
Go.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.592
Ahh, I honestly don't
know--

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
All I--
I don't.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.472
How? How can you
not know?

03:43.348 --> 03:44.724
Well...because--

03:45.683 --> 03:46.684
Okay, I don't know.

03:46.851 --> 03:47.685
All I know is--

03:47.685 --> 03:48.811
- I don't.
- Got that part.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.148
All...
I just know that we're gonna over to her house, were gonna have drinks--

03:52.273 --> 03:53.983
Okay? I don't know who else
she invited--

03:55.485 --> 03:57.528
As of right now I know
that it's us--

03:57.820 --> 03:59.155
And her boyfriend--

04:00.657 --> 04:03.159
- And...
- And the truth comes out.

04:03.868 --> 04:04.702
What?

04:04.911 --> 04:06.454
It's a fuckin' double
date--

04:09.624 --> 04:11.209
- I knew it.
- I didn't say that.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.043
I knew it.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.711
I didn't say that it
was a double date.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.546
Okay you didn't have to
say it because I knew it.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.214
You didn't know
anything.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.176
At any point in time--

04:20.176 --> 04:23.554
did she ever use the words
"double" and "date" in--

04:23.554 --> 04:24.639
the same sentence?

04:24.639 --> 04:24.681
- the same sentence?
- I don't remember.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.266
I don't remember.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.558
How convenient--

04:27.558 --> 04:28.601
And I call bullshit.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.272
I really don't.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.441
I think you'd remember
something like that.

04:35.984 --> 04:36.985
I really don't--

04:38.569 --> 04:39.279
I don't.

04:39.279 --> 04:39.946
You're good--

04:39.946 --> 04:41.864
- You're good at this you know.
- I don't...just--

04:41.864 --> 04:43.616
it wasn't one conversation--

04:43.616 --> 04:44.951
it was many conversation--

04:44.951 --> 04:48.037
You know, I feel like a jerk
I've been dodging out on her
invites for a while--

04:48.288 --> 04:50.248
- Alright.
- I feel like a jerk we're going.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.501
Well why are you even
dodging out on her--

04:53.501 --> 04:54.335
do you not like her?--

04:54.335 --> 04:55.545
Because if you don't and we go
to this-- -

04:55.586 --> 04:57.964
thing, it's just gonna make it
even more fucking awkward--

04:57.964 --> 04:59.340
What is she, some kind of
annoying person?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.009
No I like her--

05:01.050 --> 05:01.843
I do like her--

05:01.843 --> 05:03.011
I think she's really cool--

05:03.011 --> 05:03.553
I just--

05:03.678 --> 05:04.846
I don't do well--

05:05.179 --> 05:06.264
transitioning from--

05:06.681 --> 05:08.141
co-worker to buddy.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.018
So you're bringing me
along as a buffer?

05:10.268 --> 05:11.811
I'm bringing you
along because--

05:11.811 --> 05:13.688
her boyfriend Mike is going
to be there--

05:13.855 --> 05:15.857
and in case other people don't
show up--

05:16.107 --> 05:17.650
I don't wanna be the
third wheel.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.485
Because it's a fuckin'
double date.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.654
Maybe--

05:21.654 --> 05:23.364
like what's the big deal?

05:24.073 --> 05:25.450
You wanna know what the
big deal is?

05:25.575 --> 05:26.284
Mmh hmm.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.286
Double dates are
awkward--

05:28.953 --> 05:30.163
You know what kind of people
double date?--

05:30.163 --> 05:30.663
hmm?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.539
Swingers--

05:31.789 --> 05:33.416
And last time I checked we
don't swing.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.834
You're so stupid.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.377
Wha', I'm serious here--

05:36.794 --> 05:38.338
Okay, maybe not about the
swinging thing--

05:38.338 --> 05:40.173
but definitely about the awkward thing--

05:41.007 --> 05:42.675
Look we're gonna be sitting
there on their couch--

05:42.675 --> 05:43.301
We're gonna be--

05:43.301 --> 05:44.552
gauging eachother--

05:44.927 --> 05:46.512
Eye-balling eachother--

05:47.305 --> 05:49.307
Being awkwardly polite--

05:49.307 --> 05:51.934
Until we find some kinda
common ground to riff on--

05:52.101 --> 05:53.811
And then that conversation is
going to be short lived--

05:53.811 --> 05:56.064
because you can't base an
entire conversation off of--

05:56.064 --> 05:57.774
one, small, thing--

05:57.982 --> 05:59.942
So that's going to lead them
into --

05:59.942 --> 06:02.362
prying into our business,
asking about--

06:02.695 --> 06:05.031
our family, or even how we met--

06:05.031 --> 06:06.574
and I'm sure at one point
in time--

06:06.574 --> 06:08.201
you and "Vivi"--

06:08.326 --> 06:10.495
Are gonna go--
Dude don't put her in quotations.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.371
Shush!

06:11.454 --> 06:12.538
Don't put her in
quotations.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.164
Shush--

06:13.164 --> 06:14.916
You two are gonna go off on
a tangent--

06:15.166 --> 06:16.584
talking about the "chisme"
at work--

06:16.584 --> 06:18.336
"oh did you hear what that
person did--"

06:18.336 --> 06:21.255
"oh my goodness can you believe
what that other person said"--

06:21.339 --> 06:23.049
And, I'm gonna be sitting there
with Mike--

06:23.299 --> 06:25.468
trying to figure out what the
fuck to talk about--

06:25.635 --> 06:26.344
and huh--

06:26.928 --> 06:28.429
grrh, I don't wanna--

06:28.513 --> 06:29.639
I don't wanna--

06:29.764 --> 06:31.474
- I don't wanna be there with these people.
- Val these are...stop that--

06:31.474 --> 06:32.975
stop that. These are real
people--

06:32.975 --> 06:33.976
like they're real people--

06:33.976 --> 06:35.937
why do you keep using
quotation marks?

06:35.978 --> 06:38.439
- They're bunny ears.
- And when did I become a cliche.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.358
Okay, I'm almost done
with my point--

06:40.858 --> 06:42.568
I don't wanna be sitting there
with Mike--

06:42.777 --> 06:44.153
trying to figure out what to
talk about--

06:44.153 --> 06:45.613
because what if he likes
sports, alright--

06:45.696 --> 06:47.115
eh, I don't like sports--

06:47.281 --> 06:49.325
I don't think people should get
paid millions of dollars--

06:49.325 --> 06:51.452
to do something they learned
how to do during recess--

06:52.495 --> 06:53.454
What if I say that?--

06:53.454 --> 06:56.499
I'm probably gonna say that and
it's gonna be fucking awkward--

06:56.499 --> 06:56.541
I'm probably gonna say that and
it's gonna be fucking awkward--
and I'm just trying to avoid--

06:56.541 --> 06:58.376
and I'm just trying to avoid--

06:58.459 --> 06:59.293
Okay.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.504
- having an awkward encounter.
-  Uh huh, okay, okay, okay--

07:01.504 --> 07:02.255
I get it--

07:02.630 --> 07:03.548
I understand--

07:03.798 --> 07:05.049
But we're still gonna go--

07:05.842 --> 07:07.009
Okay? We're still going.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.929
Gay 'ol couple
time. It's gonna be good.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.889
Gay 'ol couple time, alright--
Gay 'ol couple time.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.307
- My favorite time.
- It's gonna be fabulous.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.434
Gay 'ol couple time.

07:15.017 --> 07:15.518
Viv.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.519

07:16.519 --> 07:18.229

Because you know,

Yeah.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.474
Don't bathe in the wine
though.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.518
That would be bad--

09:21.394 --> 09:22.186
Yes.

09:22.436 --> 09:26.107
Is that not a thing?--
Just kidding.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.485
We'll see how the rest
of the night goes.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.947
How terrible is this,
do you guys mind if I'm using
my hands?--

09:32.947 --> 09:36.200
'cause I can't...
No, you're fine.
No, no, no. Those are...
purely optional.

09:36.367 --> 09:36.909
Okay.

09:36.909 --> 09:37.743
it's...it's--

09:37.743 --> 09:38.744
It was the--

09:38.744 --> 09:40.705
- Planet...theme...
- you know...the Asian vibe.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.581
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.126
We're going for like a
save the planet, Asian style.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.087
I feel it...I feel it.

09:49.005 --> 09:49.797
Nice.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.299
That's why i have
you know--

09:52.091 --> 09:53.467
- the hair tied up.
-  that's how come the hair.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.762
It makes me feel more
free.--yeah.
Samurai.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.181
- Oh yeah--haite.
- Samuri styling.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.182
Arigoto.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.060
Mr. Roboto.

10:05.146 --> 10:10.276
I'm trying to get that
chick at work to get rid of the
plastic bags. I think that's
really necessary.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.569
Good luck--

10:11.611 --> 10:13.195
she doesn't budge on anything.--

10:13.195 --> 10:14.363
I wonder if she like--

10:14.488 --> 10:16.574
ever even farts. I don't even
think her fucking...

10:16.574 --> 10:20.578
I don't even think her
butt-cheeks like ever crack
open--

10:21.078 --> 10:22.705
So clenched all the
time.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.040
That's an epidemic.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.751
Wow...well if you think
about it, I mean ss--

10:27.084 --> 10:30.755
you start kinda feeling bad for
her, it's like "oh man" all
that build up.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.049
- I don't feel bad for her at all.
-  Oh man.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.508
It's gotta be rough
after a while.

10:34.508 --> 10:38.429
You know what I'm saying.
 so it's like, man, it's almost like I understand why you--

10:38.596 --> 10:40.473
why you hate everyone
and yourself.

10:41.307 --> 10:41.932
Okay.

10:41.932 --> 10:45.186
You suck...everybody
else can do it.
So--
No I can't.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.064
on a more serious note
I didn't want to be that guy--

10:48.064 --> 10:51.442
but um-
Oh, here we go.
Uh oh.
how did you meet?

10:52.109 --> 10:54.862
Oh shnap...she went
there.
Don't let her be--

10:54.945 --> 10:55.946
Don't let her be
that guy.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.323
- Ahhh.
-  Seriously, you don't, you don't have to answer.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.700
No, it's tot--it's
cool.
I am that guy.
Let it happen

10:59.700 --> 11:02.119
It's totally cool.
Let it happen.
Alright.

11:02.161 --> 11:06.707
Just...
like how we met and how we got together are just two different stories, so like--

11:06.707 --> 11:07.583
Aaaah.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.584
Two stories!

11:08.584 --> 11:11.545
Two different stories.
For the price of one.
Two for the price of
one, excellent.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.422
- Yeah.
-  Let's hear your tale mother goose.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.468
Well, I mean, one
of 'em really isn't a story
though--

11:17.468 --> 11:19.929
'cause like we met in school, so
it's not that interesting.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.722
Oh.
Oh, well...
Yeah...

11:21.889 --> 11:24.850
I mean, just because we
met in school doesn't mean it's
not interesting.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.352
Oh no, I didn't mean it
like that...I just--

11:26.352 --> 11:27.770
No, not you--

11:27.937 --> 11:29.021
- No!
- Naw like, ye--

11:29.105 --> 11:35.695
You know we were best
friends, you know, 'cause we met
in school and what not, you know
we had some "Andy & Ducky" stuff
going on so uh--

11:35.695 --> 11:36.195
Huh.

11:36.195 --> 11:40.241
I think it's a little
more interesting than just,
not interesting.
Alright, that's...that's
that is cute.
Well I--

11:40.241 --> 11:46.122
wasn't saying that
it's "not" interesting, I'm just
saying that I can't recall the
first time that I saw you.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.873
- Hmm, hmm.
- Can you?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.458
- Yeah.
-  I remember the first time I saw you.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.584
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.461
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.256
Okay.

11:56.173 --> 11:56.882
Yup.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.718
How-how did that
story go?

11:59.760 --> 12:01.554
I'm glad you asked,
'cause um--
Hmm?

12:03.222 --> 12:06.976
You were...you were standing
from a far and--

12:07.017 --> 12:10.062
You don't know!

You don't know!

12:10.062 --> 12:13.232
Busted!
You don't know!
Just...come on.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.359
You've been exposed
my friend.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.945
- Damn it.
- You cannot lie.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.656
I will catch you.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.616
You cannot lie.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.535
You've been duped.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.456
- She is clever this one.
- I sure am.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.959
Well okay, but how did
you guys actually end up
together then.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.587
Hmmm--

12:35.004 --> 12:35.838
Mmm--

12:35.880 --> 12:40.634
I mean like were you
guys best friends first, and
then it just happened--

12:40.634 --> 12:44.513
or were you super shy about
everything and wanted--

12:44.680 --> 12:49.393
I mean did people have to like
make you guys be together or
like, what's the story, tell me.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.436
Umm...

12:50.603 --> 12:52.480
- She's nosy as shit.
- I'm sorry.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.567
I am not! Is that not a
legitimate question to ask
at dinner?
No, it is, it is--

12:56.567 --> 12:58.110
- No it's good, it's good.
- I Just--

12:58.110 --> 12:59.111
It's good.

12:59.278 --> 12:59.862
Ss--

12:59.862 --> 13:01.655
- So, what's the sitch...
- Do tell, do tell.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.200
The sitch! I haven't
said that in a while.

13:06.118 --> 13:10.206
"Kim Possible!"

13:10.873 --> 13:16.128
Okay, best friends...

was it a blossoming romance,
like what was the story?

13:21.425 --> 13:22.468
And go.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.470
Pshoo.

Well--

13:26.931 --> 13:30.142
I had...um...well...
It's okay. She was
engaged.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.477
Oh, shit!

13:31.477 --> 13:35.147
Wait...what?
Wait, wait, wait, you,
you stole her, basicly.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.608
You were engaged?

13:37.608 --> 13:39.443
- yeesss.
- Wow.

13:40.361 --> 13:44.365
- Hmmm...ahh...

13:44.365 --> 13:46.659
It was jus...it was

13:57.294 --> 13:59.922
We don't have to...like we can
just...not...

13:59.922 --> 14:03.717
we can just not, not talk
about it at all...or we can.
Well then how did you
tell him.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.847
Well I was nervous...
you know...I just--

14:07.847 --> 14:12.309
when I was engaged I was nervous
I just...I was scared I didn't
know--

14:12.309 --> 14:15.479
where that was going to lead to,
so I just--

14:15.479 --> 14:16.897
Wait--

14:17.565 --> 14:22.278
how did you tell him...that you
were engaged?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.366
Ummm--

14:28.951 --> 14:30.452
- Jesus!
- Uh-oh.

14:30.452 --> 14:34.206
Well, we wanna hear it,

tell'em--
Spotlight.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.541
how'd you tell'em.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.253
Ummm...why...on the
phone--

14:39.795 --> 14:40.796
I--

14:41.422 --> 14:43.007
Yeah...like...

14:43.132 --> 14:46.427
- Is that how it happened?
- Ummm--

14:46.427 --> 14:50.723
yeah, I mean...we just...one of
our friends was having um, a
birthday party--

14:50.931 --> 14:55.477
so, we got in contact, we
decided to go together and--

14:55.561 --> 15:00.149
we showed up and then hardly any
of our friends were there, it
was just a small group of people

15:00.149 --> 15:05.029
so then he and I just kinda
ended up hanging out...the
whole night and--

15:05.195 --> 15:06.780
I don't know. We talked about
life--

15:06.780 --> 15:07.823
and...

15:07.948 --> 15:10.743
- That's nice.
-  You know, we just ditched the party and--

15:10.743 --> 15:12.453
I like that, that's
nice.
It was a really good
night.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.579
Classic.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.331
Yeah.

15:15.331 --> 15:20.127
And then not too long
after that I wasn't engaged
anymore and we were official.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.462
Wow.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.714
- Nice.
- Yeah.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.636
That's cute--
you guys are cute.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.640
Oh shucks. Oh shucks

15:32.640 --> 15:34.391
The scandal.

15:34.391 --> 15:37.770
- Best friends man...
- That's pretty dope.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.523
Just drive.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.400

17:35.971 --> 17:37.181
Can I tell you something?

17:38.724 --> 17:39.725
Hmmm?

17:40.350 --> 17:41.643
You look pretty.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.732
Quit being a faggot.

What?--

18:33.403 --> 18:34.947
Fuck you change quick.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.241
Well, yeah, I'm
going to sleep.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.160
Wait hold on one sec--

18:40.577 --> 18:41.578
Hmm?

18:42.204 --> 18:43.205

18:45.666 --> 18:46.792
You're a dork--

18:47.543 --> 18:49.837
It's not gonna happen buddy.

18:49.837 --> 18:54.299
Uh, I'm sorry, I couldn't
hear you over the sound of your
uncontrolable lust--

18:54.716 --> 18:56.093
Your loins--

18:56.176 --> 19:03.100
they burn, burn with desire.
Desire for some of this,
and this.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.270
- That's adorable.
- Yeah?

19:06.353 --> 19:07.938
Not happening buddy.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.942
Well can I at least have
a kiss?

19:13.777 --> 19:14.987

19:15.112 --> 19:17.030
You may have one kiss--

19:17.239 --> 19:18.824

19:19.283 --> 19:21.243
Okay--

19:21.702 --> 19:23.912

Then you get nothing.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.040
But come on--

19:27.040 --> 19:31.503

- Yesss--

20:08.916 --> 20:11.084
Well nothing good comes easy.

20:11.335 --> 20:16.506
Well thank you for

Oh, definitely not easy.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.740
I can't hold it.

20:41.740 --> 20:46.036
Yeah.
If I try and hold it
and we do this thing I'm gonna
pee on you.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.538
We haven't tried that
before.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.333
No...you fuckin'

20:51.667 --> 20:54.086
Don't...don't please.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.929
[another sigh}

21:33.083 --> 21:35.335
I'm really tired

21:36.086 --> 21:37.921
I don't think I can do this.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.508
Yeah, I had a feeling.

21:42.301 --> 21:48.724
I'll make it up to
you tomorrow night okay? I'm
sorry. I'm really tired.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.147
Okay...

21:56.356 --> 22:00.652
- Good-nite.
- Good-nite--

22:01.486 --> 22:02.487
I'm...just...

22:02.487 --> 22:05.157
- I love you.
- I love you too--

22:05.157 --> 22:06.533
Turn off the light.

22:30.515 --> 22:34.436
Yeah...It's kinda nice
though. You know?--

22:34.436 --> 22:37.981
No one else I know
kinda quite has a back-space--

22:39.149 --> 22:40.525
this wonderous.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.071
I don't think I ever
heard anyone say back-space.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.948
Well it's not a yard--
No, why not?--
You can't call it
a yard.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.033
Well, why not?

22:48.575 --> 22:51.745
Because when I think
yard I think like...you know--

22:52.662 --> 22:53.663
Some--

22:53.663 --> 22:55.415
house with like--
There's a little bit
of grass.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.167
Picket fence and--

22:57.292 --> 22:58.377
there's like--

22:58.794 --> 23:02.881
- a contained like smaller space-- Well you got a fence.
-  With a little like--

23:03.048 --> 23:03.924
you know--

23:04.925 --> 23:07.886
with their little plants and
gardens, but this is like--

23:07.886 --> 23:09.262
- A Back-Space!
- Back---space--

23:09.262 --> 23:10.972
You know it's
like not--

23:11.098 --> 23:13.558
a yard...you know...like--
Wow...I didn't know--

23:13.558 --> 23:17.229
I didn't realize you guys were
that fancy, you guys have a
back-space.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.189
No we're just--

23:19.898 --> 23:22.692
it's not about being fancy--
It's fancy.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.611
No...it's just--

23:24.611 --> 23:26.655
- Oh it's-- It's a space...
-  you know.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.865
It's fancy, and it's hip.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.035
If you could go
anywhere where would you go.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.370
In the world you mean?--

23:33.912 --> 23:35.539
Or here?

23:36.915 --> 23:38.166
In the world.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.669
uhh--

23:45.090 --> 23:46.466
Batman's cave.

23:46.883 --> 23:51.096
I'm being serious...
like...where would you go--
That where I'd go.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.723
And why would you go there,

23:56.935 --> 23:58.687
Okay--

23:58.979 --> 24:00.105
Uhh--

24:01.481 --> 24:02.732
I'd go--

24:04.025 --> 24:05.569
that's a tough one--

24:10.866 --> 24:11.741
You know what--

24:11.741 --> 24:17.038
I-well-I haven't...I haven't
been to Rome. I-I-I think
it'd be cool to like see
the coliseum.

24:17.747 --> 24:18.790
Yeah.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.793
Just, you know, like all
the history...and--

24:22.377 --> 24:24.921
that took place there and
stuff...like--

24:28.091 --> 24:30.218
That would be really
awesome--

24:31.052 --> 24:33.054
a really cool place
to go.

24:33.847 --> 24:36.391
This is total hear say
but--

24:36.516 --> 24:39.352
I heard someone say--

24:39.603 --> 24:40.687
that they--

24:40.687 --> 24:42.355
at the coliseum they--

24:42.522 --> 24:44.733
it wasn't only like...you know--

24:44.941 --> 24:49.988
like gladiator and all that kind
of like live action stuff but
that they would actually
flood it?--

24:49.988 --> 24:50.947
Or something?--

24:51.198 --> 24:51.615
For some--

24:51.615 --> 24:53.158
For another sort of
entertainment--

24:53.366 --> 24:54.409
Did you ever hear anything
like that?

24:54.409 --> 24:56.620
No, tha-that's
interesting. They'd flood it,
wow.
Like--

24:57.037 --> 24:59.873
Yeah, somehow they
were able...like flood the--
And then fi-fill it
wtih sharks, and gators--

24:59.873 --> 25:01.291
- Right.
- And then--

25:01.333 --> 25:03.418
d-whole different kind
of battle.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.129
Yeah I don't know, I don't know why they would do that...
but--

25:08.632 --> 25:10.884
it'd be rad to go
there and find out.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.677
Yeah...actually
yeah like--

25:12.844 --> 25:15.972

25:21.269 --> 25:22.395
Hmmm--

a little bit more--

32:36.663 --> 32:37.664

like how they ah--

32:44.420 --> 32:47.715

sequin-cloth-thingy--

32:48.174 --> 32:51.344
Um...you know it just sets
like a really like chill--

vibe you know, just to
kinda unwind and relax--

kinda like ah--

33:07.860 --> 33:08.945
a matte box--

33:09.362 --> 33:11.030

34:12.467 --> 34:14.719
Hell yeah! Like she's a
cunt dude, like--

34:14.719 --> 34:16.637
legitimately, like a cunt--

34:16.971 --> 34:18.181
queen of cunts--

34:18.181 --> 34:21.976
Fucking luckily I only had to
deal with her for the first
half of the shift, you know--

34:21.976 --> 34:23.686
That at least had its end--

34:24.437 --> 34:28.274
But then I high-tail it over to
"trabajo numero dos" you know--

34:28.274 --> 34:30.525
and I have to deal with the
"pisa's" in the kitchen--

34:30.525 --> 34:33.321
Fuck, they're like so
disrespectful dude--

34:33.321 --> 34:35.989
like they haven't evolved
or something like--

34:35.989 --> 34:38.534
I don't know who taught
you your manners--

34:39.118 --> 34:41.954
but you're not on the "rancho"
anymore asshole, like--

34:42.205 --> 34:43.206
You know?--

34:43.371 --> 34:45.248
the "cat-calling" man, like--

34:45.248 --> 34:46.125
they just--

34:46.125 --> 34:48.960
They're so disrespectful to
women there--

34:48.960 --> 34:51.130
like they think they're being
fucking cute.

34:51.255 --> 34:55.342
What the fuck did they
say?
They just-they're just
being pervy. They're being
pervy, disrespectful...

34:55.342 --> 34:57.053
- What do they say to you?
- Being annoying--

34:58.096 --> 35:03.434
To me? You know, it's not what
they say to me, it's what they
say to the other girls, like--

35:04.393 --> 35:06.646
And they just fucking take
it, like--

35:07.563 --> 35:10.858
I mean which is like their own
fault to some degree, but like--

35:11.067 --> 35:12.443
I don't take their shit like--

35:12.443 --> 35:13.444
They push me--

35:13.444 --> 35:14.654
I push'em back--

35:14.779 --> 35:15.363
like--

35:15.363 --> 35:19.450
I'm not-I'm not gonna play
victim. I'm not gonna succumb to
that nonesense you know.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.451
Good.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.537
Yeah.

35:23.663 --> 35:24.705
Do you ever like--

35:25.706 --> 35:27.750
say something to a manager
about it?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.962
They don't, the
managers don't care.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.964
That's stupid--

35:33.673 --> 35:35.341
That's fucking stupid--

35:36.259 --> 35:40.555
Like should I fucking go down
there then and fucking talk to
somebody 'cause it's like--

35:40.555 --> 35:42.807
- That shit make me so livid.
- Hmmm--

35:42.807 --> 35:44.725
Yeah...get me fired--

35:44.725 --> 35:45.726
you know.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.855
Well, I mean--

35:49.063 --> 35:50.439
doesn't sound like--

35:50.439 --> 35:53.067
you should really even be there
to begin with, so--

35:53.067 --> 35:55.820
maybe I'll be doing you
a favor...like--

35:56.154 --> 35:58.239
why be in that kind of --

35:58.239 --> 35:59.323
environment--

35:59.615 --> 36:00.616
you know?

36:02.577 --> 36:06.664
I understand your
concern but like I need the job.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.000
But you have another
job though?

36:10.084 --> 36:12.837
Uh-hmmm. And I
need that job too.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.256
Why?

36:15.256 --> 36:17.925
Ok-if you're so
concerned with money then--

36:17.925 --> 36:19.927
sue that place for
sexual harassment--

36:19.927 --> 36:20.887
and there you go--

36:20.887 --> 36:22.305
money problems solved

36:23.097 --> 36:24.015
uh-hmm--

36:24.015 --> 36:26.434
because it's easy to sue--

36:26.434 --> 36:28.644
and it takes no time--

36:28.644 --> 36:29.812
what-so-ever--

36:30.688 --> 36:32.064
to do that--

36:32.064 --> 36:34.775
- and...
-  Look, I get it's not practical--

36:34.775 --> 36:35.985
that wasn't the point--

36:35.985 --> 36:37.028
the point is--

36:37.028 --> 36:40.031
it's not worth the fucking
money for you to be--

36:40.031 --> 36:41.032
putting yourself--

36:41.032 --> 36:43.784
in that kind of environment
day in day out--

36:43.784 --> 36:45.578
you know it's like--

36:45.578 --> 36:50.166
it makes me feel really
uncomfortable knowing that you
feel uncomfortable being there
and--

36:50.166 --> 36:51.792
at that point, like--

36:53.127 --> 36:55.213
- why?
- I mean like--

36:55.546 --> 36:59.133
I-it's annoying, like it's
annoying to see--

36:59.133 --> 37:02.345
- as a female, as a latino like yeah.
-  Right--

37:02.345 --> 37:03.971
- yeah, look...
- but like--

37:03.971 --> 37:05.014
I know, look I get you--
I mean--

37:05.014 --> 37:07.183
I get where you're coming
from-eh-ah-trust me--
like-you're not,like-

37:07.183 --> 37:09.185
You are hav-you're
hearing it--

37:09.185 --> 37:13.648
on your perspective, like you're
listening to my story and like--

37:13.648 --> 37:15.775
making it your thing. You're
internalizing it.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.903
Mine-it's not my-it's
your thi-it's still your thing
ah-agh--

37:18.903 --> 37:20.571
I'm ss-I'm sorr-I'm ah--
Well you're clearly
upset--

37:20.571 --> 37:24.116
- You're clearly upset.
-  I am, because I give a fuck, 'cause I care about you--

37:24.116 --> 37:26.827
'cause I care about you,
I see that it bothers you so
it bothers me--

37:26.827 --> 37:27.745
What bothers you--
So then you--

37:27.745 --> 37:30.206
bothers me--
So it bothers you so
then you tell me what to do--

37:30.206 --> 37:31.958
and you tell me how to
do things--

37:31.958 --> 37:35.169
I'm not trying to tell
you how to do anything.
You just did,
like you just--

37:35.169 --> 37:36.712
- did.
-  I'm telling you what I feel--

37:36.712 --> 37:38.839
how I feel, how I feel about
your situation--

37:38.839 --> 37:41.467
I feel you should do that and I
don't understand why you don't.
Like, I feel like
you're telling me what to do--

37:41.467 --> 37:43.344
- That's it.
-  As if I don't already know what to do like--

37:43.344 --> 37:45.846
I'm not allowed to vent. I'm
not allowed to say anything.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.099
Just like you're venting
right now I'm venting right back
like--

37:48.099 --> 37:51.894
it-I mean, it bothers me so
I'm-I'm just venting right
ba-back to ya I-wu-wha--

37:51.894 --> 37:54.146
I ah-OK. I--

37:54.230 --> 37:56.983
I'm just talking, I-I mean
I'm sorry, I-I didn't--

37:56.983 --> 38:00.236
I'd--

38:05.491 --> 38:09.412
Like I don't...
I don't even know what to say man like I just--

38:09.412 --> 38:14.208
I'm tired...I'm hungry...just
like--

38:14.208 --> 38:15.418
I'm a make dinner.

38:28.097 --> 38:32.268
Except maybe I wouldn't
have named our son, Elvis.

38:43.070 --> 38:47.616
You'd think he'd wear
like a sweat-suit to work or
something you know, he sweats
a lot.
Sweats?

38:48.784 --> 38:50.828
Then people wouldn't
take him as serious.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.080
Being in a sweat-suit--

38:53.080 --> 38:54.874
like who's this dude
in a sweat-suit--

38:54.874 --> 38:56.334
tryin' ah--

38:56.334 --> 38:57.668
handle some business.

38:57.668 --> 39:01.255
- Right?
-  Who handles business in a sweat-suit?

39:01.255 --> 39:05.259
I don't know-
Russian mafia?
Like yeah, like shady
dudes.

39:12.433 --> 39:16.437
"- Just another day in the job".
-  Exactly.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.356
He's gonna have a
cigarette now, watch.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.942
It's like nobody
offers this guy a fuckin'-
glass of water.
Or a-or a s--

39:21.942 --> 39:24.445
He just like saved
everyone's lives.
Or a bourbon or something
like--

39:24.445 --> 39:27.073
Like after-after doing
something like that I'd need
a drink.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.368
Be like--

39:30.368 --> 39:31.911
fuck my life--

39:31.911 --> 39:33.954
somebody get me a drink.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.792
This is-
I don't know why this
still scares me, it's like--

39:37.792 --> 39:38.918
uhh.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.211
'Cause, is it thee--

39:40.211 --> 39:41.462
wait a-wait--

39:41.754 --> 39:43.839
Think it's my
parents fault.

39:46.258 --> 39:47.259
They use like--

39:47.259 --> 39:49.011
'The Exorcist" as a kid--

39:49.011 --> 39:50.638
like as a form of like--

39:50.638 --> 39:51.806
you know--

39:51.806 --> 39:53.015
spiritual teaching--

39:53.015 --> 39:55.476
like this can happen to you if
you like--

39:55.476 --> 39:58.938
- If you do drugs and y-you're bad.
-  You know, it's like--

39:58.938 --> 40:00.898
They're taking over--

40:00.898 --> 40:02.525
and you will die.

40:02.525 --> 40:05.486
That's parenting 1-0-1.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.779
Nooo.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.410
Mickey.

40:12.827 --> 40:13.994
Hmm?

40:14.161 --> 40:16.038
The movie's over Mickey--

40:18.457 --> 40:20.501
- What do you wanna do now?
- Hmm?--

40:21.377 --> 40:24.046
hhhm, I kinda wanna sleep.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.341
Do you wanna stay
the night?--

40:27.466 --> 40:29.510
I can sleep on the couch, or--

40:29.510 --> 40:30.636
somewhere else.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.514
Hhmmm--

40:35.850 --> 40:38.144
I mean you don't have
to--

40:38.144 --> 40:41.522
stay here if you don't want to,
I'm just, I'm just saying
you can.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.942
No, I mean it's-it's
fine, but is it cool--

40:44.942 --> 40:47.778
if I stay here?
Yeah totally. I mean I
wouldn't of a--

40:47.778 --> 40:50.239
you know, offered if it wasn't.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.700
Okay.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.077
Do you want me to go?

40:55.494 --> 40:58.789
No, I'm not gonna
kick you out of your own room.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.750
Y-you-you can stay
here don't just--

41:01.750 --> 41:04.336
t-don't try anything funny.

41:05.045 --> 41:08.174
Pshhh. Mickey please--

41:08.174 --> 41:11.343
what are you trying to say?

41:11.343 --> 41:12.720
Good-nite.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.305
Good-nite.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.783
We never held hands.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.077
What?

41:38.996 --> 41:41.499
We're gonna sleep in the
same bed and--

41:42.166 --> 41:43.918
we've just never--

41:43.918 --> 41:45.044
held hands--

41:45.044 --> 41:46.754
I just think it's kinda funny.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.256
We're not gonna do it.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.591
Oh-what?

41:50.591 --> 41:51.759
We're not gonna
do it--
I--

41:51.759 --> 41:54.303
So don't--
Na-I heard you, I--

41:54.303 --> 41:59.975
I didn't say-I know we're
not gonna do it I'm just saying
that there's like an order of
doing things and--

41:59.975 --> 42:03.687
you know, we're just skipping
steps is all.
Okay...okay.

42:03.687 --> 42:07.566
We can kill two birds
with one stone--

42:07.566 --> 42:08.817
alright.

42:09.985 --> 42:12.821
O-kay.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.414
You know we've also have
never made out.

42:22.414 --> 42:24.583
Dude...you have to
kill it--

42:24.583 --> 42:27.169
you have to kill it...every-time
don't you--

42:27.169 --> 42:29.046
- you kill it.
- It was a joke.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.298
- No.
- I was kidding.

42:31.298 --> 42:33.133
Good-nite man.

42:34.009 --> 42:35.928
- Can I have your hand back?
-  No-o.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.429
- Please.
- No.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.430
Why not?

42:38.430 --> 42:41.350
Because I'm afraid of
what you'll do to it.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.060
That's terrible--

42:43.060 --> 42:46.105
Why would you say such a
terrible thing?

42:53.362 --> 42:54.488
Mickey--

42:54.488 --> 42:56.282
- baby?
- Hmm?

42:56.282 --> 42:59.076
It's late. Let's go
to bed.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.911
Hmm?

43:00.911 --> 43:02.830
Come on let's go to bed--

43:03.497 --> 43:05.082
come on--

43:05.666 --> 43:09.295
come on...come on...come on
come on--

43:09.295 --> 43:11.422
come on...there you go--

43:11.422 --> 43:13.340
there you go--

43:13.340 --> 43:16.719
there you go...let's get you
to bed.

43:40.576 --> 43:43.912
Hey, can I ask you
something without you taking
it the wrong way?--

43:43.912 --> 43:45.080
I mean in--

43:45.080 --> 43:48.876
all seriousness, can we like
enter this cone of trust type
deal where we--

43:48.876 --> 43:51.670
can just discuss this topic
without bumming eachother out?

43:51.670 --> 43:53.672
Whoa...

43:53.672 --> 43:55.424
It's nothing bad.

43:57.176 --> 43:58.927
Ya sure?

44:00.721 --> 44:02.973
You know what, nevermind,
just forget it.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.225
Just ask.

44:05.225 --> 44:09.396
Well I don't wanna ask if
we can't talk about it properly.

44:09.396 --> 44:10.606
Well then--

44:11.315 --> 44:15.569
ask, and we can find out if
that's a possibility.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.573
O-K--

44:24.328 --> 44:31.543
In the last five years do
you feel like much's changed
other than our living situation?

44:31.543 --> 44:32.628
A lot--

44:32.628 --> 44:33.629
has changed.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.381
Specifically what?

44:36.298 --> 44:38.342
I don't know...like--

44:38.634 --> 44:41.762
our living situation is a
really big one--

44:41.762 --> 44:45.265
like it changed a lot of other
things in our lives--

44:45.724 --> 44:47.726
I don't feel suffocated by--

44:47.726 --> 44:50.354
our environment anymore, I--

44:50.354 --> 44:53.941
don't hate my jobs as much as
I hated my old job--

44:54.400 --> 44:56.860
We're not obligated to
family drama--

44:56.860 --> 44:58.779
anymore, so that's--

44:59.279 --> 45:02.491
those are all big things that
have changed--

45:03.450 --> 45:04.827
You don't agree?

45:04.827 --> 45:06.245
I mean--

45:06.245 --> 45:08.205
yes, no, like--

45:08.205 --> 45:10.457
for as positive as those things
sound--

45:10.457 --> 45:11.542
I just don't really--

45:11.542 --> 45:14.420
feel like I'm seeing any kind of
real progression--

45:14.420 --> 45:16.630
And honestly how positive is--

45:16.630 --> 45:20.008
"oh I don't hate my current jobs
as much as my last job"
shouldn't it be--

45:20.008 --> 45:21.969
I don't hate my job at all?--

45:21.969 --> 45:25.013
I just remember us having all
these goals and stuff--

45:25.013 --> 45:27.766
before coming out here, and then
all of a sudden somewhere
between--

45:27.766 --> 45:32.521
now and then it's like we just
said "Fuck it" and stopped
trying to achieve them.

45:33.021 --> 45:35.232
I didn't, stop trying.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.901
Really? I mean, wha' have
you been doing?

45:39.737 --> 45:40.904
Wow.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.866
Look, don't take that the
wrong way alright, I'm not
trying to attack you.

45:43.866 --> 45:44.867
Why do you do that?

45:44.867 --> 45:46.452
Do what?

45:46.952 --> 45:49.413
That was a--fuckin'
dick thing to say.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.373
Well I didn't mean it
that way alright--

45:51.373 --> 45:55.085
look I'm sorry if I have trouble
wording things properly
sometimes--
Yeah--

45:55.085 --> 45:57.504
you do, you do maybe
you should--
so don't take offense
to it.

45:57.504 --> 46:00.799
fuckin' think before
you speak.
Oh my god, okay,
let's just--

46:00.799 --> 46:02.968
put the breaks there for
a second 'cause uh--

46:02.968 --> 46:06.513
we're getting off the track
really fast and I do not want
to fight with you--

46:06.513 --> 46:08.766
so--can we--
No, I don't want to
fight with you.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.350
Okay, good...Perfect--

46:10.350 --> 46:13.020
well then can...you--

46:13.020 --> 46:15.981
just hear me out when I...
when I say--

46:16.106 --> 46:17.107
like what have you--

46:17.107 --> 46:20.778
done, it's more like-like what
have we done as individuals you
know to try ah--

46:20.778 --> 46:24.031
get to where we wanna be, I mean
why aren't we where we wanna be--

46:24.031 --> 46:24.907
to begin with.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.367
I don't know how to
answer that dude, like--

46:27.367 --> 46:29.912
I feel like we've had this
conversation before.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.623
No we haven't.
 We haven't had this specific conversation.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.793
Well I mean we've had
conversations like it--

46:36.168 --> 46:38.295
whenever you...start--

46:38.295 --> 46:43.217
feeling like "I'm not living up
to my potential" like you start
going into existential crisis
mode--

46:43.217 --> 46:45.093
you start coming at me--

46:45.260 --> 46:48.597
you start asking me why I'm not
working on the things that I
should be working on--

46:48.597 --> 46:52.351
or why I'm not helping you work
on the things that you should be
working on--

46:52.351 --> 46:56.271
and it just goes on and on like-
I'm not trying to blame
you for my actions or lack
there of--

46:56.271 --> 47:01.985
Oh really--
okay--I acknowledge that
yes I'm not fu-I'm not living up
to my own potential--

47:01.985 --> 47:03.320
and that's my own fault--

47:03.320 --> 47:06.824
I'm not putting that on you, I
just want to know that we still--

47:06.824 --> 47:09.993
have these goals and we're still
working towards them, that's--

47:09.993 --> 47:11.328
- the bottom line.
- But like--

47:11.328 --> 47:12.663
how can I tell you--

47:12.663 --> 47:15.791
if you still have your goals,
how can I do that?

47:15.791 --> 47:20.379
Oh-okay.
 uh-uh fine, well I mean do you still have your goals?

47:20.587 --> 47:21.630
Yes.

47:21.672 --> 47:22.881
Good--

47:23.799 --> 47:24.800
cool--

47:25.759 --> 47:27.094
I mean wha'--

47:27.469 --> 47:31.098
If you don't mind me asking like
what-a-you what-a-you still
trying to do?

47:32.307 --> 47:33.141
I'm--

47:33.141 --> 47:36.353
I want to do my photography.

47:37.271 --> 47:38.313
Really?--

47:38.605 --> 47:41.942
But you like haven't done your
photography in like forever.

47:42.442 --> 47:43.819
Yeah I'm aware of
that--

47:43.819 --> 47:45.779
and I still wanna persue it--

47:45.779 --> 47:47.197
as funny as that is.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.448
Um-I'm sorry again--

47:48.448 --> 47:50.409
As hilarious as that
might sound--
Okay look no, it's, you--

47:50.409 --> 47:53.120
- you know?
- look, look, look-fuck--

47:54.288 --> 47:56.498
That's cool I-my bad--

47:59.793 --> 48:02.462
Why, don't you, instead
of like--

48:02.462 --> 48:04.214
you know, try'na do--

48:04.214 --> 48:05.465
you know two jobs, wha--
Okay--

48:05.465 --> 48:08.677
why don't you focus more
on photography then. Why don't
you do that.
no, no, no, why don't,
why don't you--

48:08.677 --> 48:10.012
not tell me how'd ah--

48:10.012 --> 48:13.265
do things, why don't you...stop
telling me how to--

48:13.307 --> 48:18.103
oh I could do it this way or I
should do it that way or...
maybe like--

48:18.186 --> 48:19.730
why do you do that?--

48:19.730 --> 48:22.232
Like I don't need you to do
that for me--

48:22.232 --> 48:24.526
I know what I want to do
for myself--

48:24.526 --> 48:26.194
I want to do photography--

48:26.194 --> 48:27.195
I wanna do it!--

48:27.195 --> 48:28.614
I have my camera--

48:28.614 --> 48:29.990
I have my laptop--

48:30.073 --> 48:33.952
I have my certificate in
cosmotology I don't have to
depend on other people--

48:33.952 --> 48:36.330
to supply me with looks that I
want for my shoot--

48:36.330 --> 48:37.998
I got my bachelor's degree--

48:37.998 --> 48:39.249
in business management--

48:39.249 --> 48:40.250
I can work out--

48:40.250 --> 48:41.418
a business plan--

48:41.418 --> 48:42.586
for myself--

48:42.586 --> 48:45.255
so I can be properly
self-employed--

48:45.255 --> 48:48.342
Like I've thought it through.
I've lined things up--

48:48.342 --> 48:50.093
Right, I've heard that
before--
I've made an effort--

48:50.093 --> 48:52.888
- I have made an effort.
-  I've-I've heard that before and--

48:52.888 --> 48:56.058
you know I'm-forgive me for
caring--

48:56.433 --> 48:58.018
like everything you just said--

48:58.018 --> 49:01.271
just shows that you have every-
thing at your disposal to--

49:01.271 --> 49:02.981
be doing what it is that you
wanna do--

49:02.981 --> 49:05.442
but you're not doing it and
that's my whole thing--

49:05.484 --> 49:07.611
it's like when is it gonna
happen?

49:07.611 --> 49:09.488
It--

49:09.529 --> 49:11.323
When it happens--

49:11.323 --> 49:12.658
It's my thing.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.034
Okay, but that does-
that's not--

49:14.034 --> 49:16.828
getting us anywhere you me
anybody like--

49:16.828 --> 49:19.790
"when it happens," what the fuck
does that mean?

49:20.123 --> 49:21.124
Okay--

49:21.792 --> 49:22.793
so like--

49:22.793 --> 49:24.378
are you concerned--

49:24.378 --> 49:26.463
with what I am not doing?--

49:26.463 --> 49:28.924
Or are you concerned with what
you are not doing?

49:28.924 --> 49:30.050
Both.

49:32.636 --> 49:35.889
Eh, am I not...
I don-i don't know
what to tell you...we're--

49:35.889 --> 49:37.599
I don't know what to say--

49:38.642 --> 49:40.519
what can I say, what can I tell
you?--

49:40.519 --> 49:42.813
Like wer-we're gonna have to
figure it out--

49:42.813 --> 49:45.983
Like that's it, that's all there
is to it.
Good, alright, well let's
figure it out.

49:45.983 --> 49:46.900
Okay--

49:46.900 --> 49:48.527
Well we're gonna have to do it
some other night--

49:48.527 --> 49:50.529
because I have to go to sleep!
-- No, no, come on--

49:50.529 --> 49:52.072
I have to go
to sleep!
don't do that, don't run
away from this--

49:52.072 --> 49:53.281
don't run away from this,
look--

49:53.281 --> 49:55.200
- I am not running away!
-  I don't wanna end the night like this--

49:55.200 --> 49:56.660
you are being a dick
about it!--

49:56.660 --> 50:02.124
I am not running away.
Oh my god, oh my god why
can't we just have discussions
without them turning into this
kind of shit.

50:02.124 --> 50:06.169
Well maybe it's the
way that you fuckin' approach
shit you know--

50:08.213 --> 50:10.465
Maybe you shouldn't come into
things asking me--

50:10.465 --> 50:13.135
"Um, can we enter a cone
of trust--

50:13.135 --> 50:14.970
where we don't bum eachother
out?"--

50:14.970 --> 50:16.304
like you decided--

50:16.304 --> 50:19.182
you were bummed out already
before it even started--

50:19.349 --> 50:21.143
And then you go around and you
ask me--

50:21.143 --> 50:23.562
"what's changed in the last
five years?"--

50:23.854 --> 50:26.940
Like why don't you just start
the conversation by saying--

50:26.940 --> 50:29.151
"I want things to change"--

50:30.235 --> 50:33.697
Don't worry about what I'm doing
worry about what you're doing.

50:34.823 --> 50:37.617
Work on youself,
I will work on myself--

50:37.617 --> 50:38.785
support me--

50:38.785 --> 50:40.704
I will support you--

50:42.289 --> 50:44.166
Like what the fuck!

50:44.291 --> 50:47.878
Look I am gonna work
on me, and I hear ya loud
and clear--

50:47.878 --> 50:51.590
and I am trying to support you,
but I just feel like right now
all I'm doing is--

50:51.590 --> 50:53.967
supporting your procrastination
and it's not really get--

50:53.967 --> 50:55.010
I'm sorry look--

50:55.010 --> 50:57.554
our procrastination, I meant our
procrastination--

50:57.554 --> 51:01.183
I heard you, like--

51:03.101 --> 51:05.854
just...just good-nite,
good-nite.

51:06.354 --> 51:09.066
That's probably best,
good-nite.

51:11.610 --> 51:13.403
And where are you
going?

51:14.321 --> 51:18.992
I'm gonna go to the
office, and I'm gonna try to do
something productive.
Is that alright?

52:09.543 --> 52:10.836
So--

52:10.836 --> 52:12.420
presents?

52:12.420 --> 52:13.505
Yes--

52:13.630 --> 52:15.841
but I wanna go first,
give me, give me, give me,
give me--

52:15.841 --> 52:17.634
- give me...
- Okay, okay, okay.

52:23.098 --> 52:28.645
]

52:30.105 --> 52:31.690
I thought you
disappeared.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.111
Okay...so--

52:37.529 --> 52:42.242
there was something I originally
wanted to buy you but I figured
that you already had it, so
thought I'd--

52:42.242 --> 52:45.620
try to be a little more original
and just make something.

52:46.037 --> 52:47.038
I'm excited.

52:47.038 --> 52:49.791
And thus I drew your
pretty face.

52:49.791 --> 52:51.710
Awe.

52:52.919 --> 52:55.338
I've never been drawn
before. It's really cool.

52:58.216 --> 52:59.676
I'm gonna frame it--

52:59.676 --> 53:02.345
or it's framed already but--
Ah yeah, I was gonna--

53:02.345 --> 53:04.181
I meant I was gonna
hang it up--

53:04.514 --> 53:07.767
just so everybody can see it,
and that way when you're
famous--

53:07.767 --> 53:10.520
- they'll be jealous.
- Oh nonesense.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.855
Oh shut up.

53:14.357 --> 53:16.234

55:38.251 --> 55:40.086

for you--

55:40.086 --> 55:42.172
So...please hav-have
a seat.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.548
Yu-got-epp-epp--

55:43.548 --> 55:44.591

55:44.591 --> 55:45.675
There ya go--

55:45.675 --> 55:47.218

55:47.218 --> 55:48.553
gentleman about it.

55:49.304 --> 55:50.930
Mmmm--

55:50.930 --> 55:52.891
- Well that's nice.
- Cool.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.517
I thought I'd ah--

55:54.517 --> 55:55.894
you know set something
up--

55:55.894 --> 55:57.729
to the point where you
can have--

55:57.729 --> 55:58.897
a date--

55:58.897 --> 55:59.981
and--

55:59.981 --> 56:02.275
be in your p.j.'s at the
same time.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.361
Yeah, uh--
So--

56:04.361 --> 56:06.905
I don't think I'm a
bother with that right now.

56:06.905 --> 56:09.199
Alright then...well I
mean...

56:09.324 --> 56:12.410
- Oh uh would you like a beer?
-  I'm sorry, where are my manners.

56:12.410 --> 56:13.411
Sure.

56:14.913 --> 56:16.164
Good answer.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.376
Now--

56:19.376 --> 56:22.587
I don't think you've had
this guy before--

56:23.588 --> 56:25.632
So I'd hope you like it--

56:26.466 --> 56:27.717
I like it--

56:27.717 --> 56:28.843
Oh--

56:28.843 --> 56:30.053
Oh--

56:30.053 --> 56:30.970
Look at you--

56:30.970 --> 56:32.472
Ah--
So thoughtful--

56:32.472 --> 56:33.848
Catching yourself.

56:35.183 --> 56:36.768
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

56:41.689 --> 56:42.857
- Mmmh.
- Yeah?

56:42.857 --> 56:43.858
Uh-huh.

56:43.858 --> 56:45.443
- Yeay?
- Yeay.

56:45.443 --> 56:46.403
Yee-ay.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.405
Yee-aay.

56:48.405 --> 56:49.948
Um--

56:50.740 --> 56:52.784
So...uh shall we?

56:54.285 --> 56:55.995
- Uh-mm, yeah.
- Ladies first.

56:55.995 --> 56:58.373
You get...you get the
pickin's.

56:58.373 --> 56:59.499
Except for that one.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.167
Joking, yeah you can have
that one.

57:01.167 --> 57:03.711
- I'm gonna grab this one.
-  Okay good.

57:04.712 --> 57:07.006
I will grab this one.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.759
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

57:09.759 --> 57:11.469
- Pizza cheers.
- Pizza cheers.

57:11.469 --> 57:11.970
oh.

57:11.970 --> 57:13.763
- Oh, eh-for our homies.
- Nice piece of garlic.

57:15.598 --> 57:16.808
Hmm.

57:19.477 --> 57:21.396
- Mmm-huh.
- It's good.

57:23.815 --> 57:27.277
Oh yeah I made sure there
was plenty of garlic on that.

57:27.318 --> 57:29.070
Good job.
Mm-huh.
It's really good.

57:29.070 --> 57:30.905
So we're definitely gonna
make-out later.

57:30.905 --> 57:32.449
- Oh yeah-- Mm-huh.
-  Hard.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.992
- ah-huh.
- Uh-hmm.

57:36.828 --> 57:39.330
I went on a...jog earlier
today.

57:40.540 --> 57:41.916
And um--

57:41.916 --> 57:44.085
I was doing a lot of
thinking and--

57:44.085 --> 57:47.297
I had totally forgot
about that one time when we ah--

57:47.964 --> 57:50.175
planned that "unbirthday"
for eachother--

57:50.175 --> 57:51.968
- Mm-hmm.
-  Remember, and I drew that picture for you?

57:51.968 --> 57:53.136
Uh-huh.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.805
Yeah, that was a nice
night wasn't it?

57:56.931 --> 57:59.100
I mean I love
the picture.

57:59.809 --> 58:00.810
But--

58:01.603 --> 58:03.396
that wasn't the
greatest night.

58:03.396 --> 58:04.397
No?

58:04.898 --> 58:06.065
Nuh-uh.

58:06.065 --> 58:07.609
Why? What happened?

58:08.526 --> 58:09.903
I killed it.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.196
- You did?
- Pretty. much.

58:11.196 --> 58:12.322
Mm-huh.

58:13.323 --> 58:14.365
Yeah.

58:14.949 --> 58:17.410
Remember I got drunk,
I acted like a jerk.

58:20.788 --> 58:22.290
I love moments
like these.

58:23.416 --> 58:24.834
Hmmm?

58:25.627 --> 58:28.087
Like when you're just
hanging out with someone and--

58:28.379 --> 58:29.130
you just--

58:29.130 --> 58:31.591
bullshit and talk about
random stuff and--

58:32.383 --> 58:33.635
all of a sudden there's a--

58:33.635 --> 58:34.594
quiet--

58:34.928 --> 58:35.929
moment--

58:37.180 --> 58:39.724
but not like an awkward quiet,
it's just--

58:39.724 --> 58:40.850
more like--

58:41.267 --> 58:42.519
still an'--

58:42.685 --> 58:44.020
peaceful an'--

58:47.482 --> 58:50.443
I try to store those
moments in my mind like a
picture--

58:50.443 --> 58:52.445
so i can draw'em later.

58:56.074 --> 58:58.493
And I think it's those
pauses--

58:58.493 --> 59:02.038
they're like the defining parts
of those moments too you know.

59:05.208 --> 59:06.918
Not really.

59:08.127 --> 59:10.046
Let me put it this way--

59:11.506 --> 59:12.882
it's like if I were gonna--

59:12.882 --> 59:13.967
draw--

59:14.133 --> 59:15.176
a comic strip--

59:15.176 --> 59:16.427
of this moment--

59:17.679 --> 59:20.223
like on the first page I would
dedicate--

59:20.223 --> 59:22.600
at least three to four panels
of--

59:22.600 --> 59:27.397
just how I view the moment
before actually like
implementing any kind of--

59:28.273 --> 59:31.484
characters in action poses.

59:36.531 --> 59:39.576
There aren't a lot of comics
that do that kind of stuff.

59:40.451 --> 59:42.537
I think everyone's just afraid
of--

59:42.537 --> 59:44.831
embracing the stillness--

59:45.248 --> 59:47.333
just slowing things down--

59:49.002 --> 59:50.628
I wanna have a lot of--

59:50.628 --> 59:52.338
those still moments--

59:52.338 --> 59:53.965
in my comic.

59:59.637 --> 01:00:03.182
Don't you think people
might find that kinda boring
though?

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:08.062
Uh--

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.231
sure I mean--

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.986
Maybe...but--

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.405
I don't think that really
matters 'cause--

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:19.532
those kind of people--

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:24.370
who'd find it boring aren't
gonna be the type of people that
are going to be into my comic
book so--

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.624
fuck'em...I don't think it
really matters.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:32.837
Why is your comic
gonna be like some sort of
hipster exclusive or something?

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.550
Uhh-um--

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.635
sure.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:43.014
Oh fuck--

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.308
I'm sorry--

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.352
that came off mean--

01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:48.895
Sorry.

01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:51.314
Hey it's cool--

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:53.316
don't worry about it.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.818
It's fuckin' not--

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:56.819
cool--

01:00:57.278 --> 01:00:58.696
It's not cool--

01:00:58.696 --> 01:00:59.781
fuck.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.950
Are you okay?

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:06.746
Yeah, I'm fuckin' fine
can we just call it a night?--

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.164
I'm...just--

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.540
over it.

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:14.253
Are you alright to drive?

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.924
Yeah I'm not fuckin'
stupid so I think I can fuckin'
drive.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.094
Yo I didn't--

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.137
I mean, mean anything by it--

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:24.597
I was just--

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.224
checkin' wit' you.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.392
Yeah--

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.018
can you jus' get in
the fuckin' car--

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.186
so we can--

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.605
I just wanna get out of here
now.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.110
You know what I'll just
walk.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:41.364
Why do you fucking wanna walk everywhere?
 Just get in the fucking car!

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.866
I just think you should
just go straight home--

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:47.412
rather than have to drop me off
first is all.
Jus' get in the
fucking car--

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.414
so I can take you home,
let's go.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:54.460
Fine whatever.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:01.342
I was drunk, I acted
like a jerk--

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:04.095
like can we change the
subject?--

01:02:04.178 --> 01:02:05.179
we don't--

01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:07.515
I thought we were supposed to be
having a good time like--

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:10.017
We are you know I'm
sorry...no, um--

01:02:10.017 --> 01:02:11.310
let's--

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.645
you're right--

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:13.479
Ah--

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.064
I--
Why are we talking
about that?

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.566
I-I just--

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.026
I don't know, I just ah
I-I--

01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:22.989
I didn't remember exactly
wha' happened and I guess I was
you know I'm sorry--

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:24.157
you're right, you're
right-

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.366
pizza, pizza time--

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.119
What time is it?

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.954
- Pizza time.
- Right--

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:33.166
Perfect.
Pizza time.
Good.

01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:52.560
You know, don't get me
wrong like you are a really--

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.437
you're a great guy--

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:58.608
You're my favorite
person in the world but lately
it's been--

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.942
difficult--

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.736
being around you--

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.156
like working two jobs
is hard--

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.492
Mickey you don't have to
work two jobs--

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:09.452
But I kinda feel like
I do--

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.829
- though.
-  Then why do you feel that way is what llike--

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.664
what I contribute not enough?

01:03:13.664 --> 01:03:16.000
It's n--

01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:19.545
It's not that it's not enough
I just--

01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:24.759
I mean you're
freelance you know like it makes
me nervous--

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.345
having a question mark on your
next gig.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:29.263
Wait so like--

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.599
hold on I mean like--

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:37.188
So ev-even if-if I was doing
what I wanted to do then--

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.483
it would still be the same issue
because--

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:41.609
ye--

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:45.947
all artists have like a high
probability of--

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:49.492
of inconsistent income so--

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.493
wa--

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.204
oh my god--

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:55.748
you know what Mickey?--

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:58.835
Ah-I think you're biggest issue
is me--

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.087
I'm your biggest problem.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:05.091
Huh, that's not what
I'm saying it just--

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.843
it would be different--

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.220
if you were doing what you
really wanted--

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:12.849
How would that be
different, it's the same thing.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.936
It wouldn't because you'd be in a different head space and...
like--

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.230
that changes everything--

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:23.109
Like I'm really sensitive to the
energy you put out.

01:04:28.489 --> 01:04:29.740
But ah--

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:33.077
you know isn't that kinda of ah--

01:04:33.494 --> 01:04:35.997
double standard...I mean--

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.999
like ah, the other night,
though--

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:42.795
ya know ya-ya come home from
work venting about it in a not
so positive fashion an--

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:45.089
then you snap at me because it
was stressing me out.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:47.592
Yeah but that had
nothing to do with me ah--

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:52.471
I walked in you were already in
a bad place you were in ya head
you were being negative.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:57.143
Alright-but I mean
tha-that's besides the point,
you know, it's not like you
yourself were--

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.936
talking about the--

01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:00.187
tales of--

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:01.856
of happiness--

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:07.236
and joy that you get from the
two jobs that you adore with all
your heart--

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:17.788
Mickey?
 Is-is that why you're not doing your photography, like ye--

01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:19.290
you're just--

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:20.958
you're scared of--

01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:24.003
of inconsistency?

01:05:34.221 --> 01:05:37.808
Hey I know you don't want to
hear from me right now--

01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:39.226
but you forgot some stuff--

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:41.646
just got home and I'm a bit
tired--

01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:44.690
but you can get it whenever.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.901
