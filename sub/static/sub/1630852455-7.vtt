WEBVTT

01:56.560 --> 01:57.640
I'll go and see.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.400
Um, yeah.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.160
Go!

02:18.720 --> 02:22.520
Ray. What the fuck is going on?
What do you remember?

02:23.880 --> 02:25.360
I need to talk to Cassie.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.080


02:31.160 --> 02:36.160


02:36.240 --> 02:41.880


02:41.960 --> 02:45.840


02:45.920 --> 02:49.000


02:49.080 --> 02:51.080


02:51.160 --> 02:53.160


02:53.920 --> 02:55.960


02:56.040 --> 02:57.560


02:57.640 --> 03:02.080


03:07.360 --> 03:09.880
I don't understand.
How can you not have found them yet?

03:09.960 --> 03:10.880
We are trying.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.120
Trying? Try harder!

03:13.960 --> 03:15.040
They killed Harry.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.480
When I think about what could've happened
to Kayleigh if I hadn't got there in time…

03:19.560 --> 03:22.960
If we understood why they were after you,
that could help us.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.080
I told you.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.720
I came home.
There was a note. Kayleigh was gone.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.400
People don't just kidnap children
for the fun of it.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.280
They have planned for this.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.520
There's gonna be a reason
why they want to get to you.

03:38.040 --> 03:42.040
-We must be missing something.
-I've already told you everything.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.800
Where were you
the night of April the 16th?

03:49.920 --> 03:51.040
It was last Friday.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.760
I was with Dave and the kids. Why?

03:54.680 --> 03:56.320
A young man, Carlton Flynn,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.080
disappeared that night.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.200
It was exactly 17 years to the day
after Stewart Green.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.000
We believe the disappearances are linked,

04:04.080 --> 04:08.240
and we're also inclined to think that
whatever happened to Harry and Kayleigh

04:08.320 --> 04:10.280
had something to do with them too.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.000
I don't know
anything about this Carlton Flynn.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.720
He has nothing to do with my family.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.800
Those freaks took my child.
They could have killed her.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.400
I don't know what they want,

04:23.480 --> 04:26.560
but you need to find them
and make this stop, please.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.520
We used Kayleigh's description
of the kidnappers' car,

04:41.600 --> 04:45.720
tracked their journey to the cabin,
and found this on CCTV.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.280
The license plate
is registered to a rental company,

04:49.360 --> 04:52.000
so we should have
their IDs and names soon.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.520
Good work.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.360
What is it?

04:57.440 --> 04:59.040
She looks familiar, doesn't she?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.280
Kayleigh Shaw.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.200
Hey.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.280
-Ah, thank God you're safe.

05:10.360 --> 05:11.720
Mmm.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.760
-Oh. Come here.
-Hey.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.920
Mmm.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.400
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.320
-You're not hurt?
-No.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.080
-What happened? Why'd they take Kayleigh?
-We're fine.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.280
The police are gonna put us up
while the forensics check over the house.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.000
-We're safe.
-Okay. But what happened?

05:31.320 --> 05:34.600
-I'm gonna go and get some chocolate.
-Hey, you are not leaving my sight.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.320
Dad, it's a police station. I'll be fine.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.240
Okay.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.720
I'll be with her the whole time.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.160
Megan, what happened? Who took her?

05:48.280 --> 05:49.680
I don't know who they were.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.400
But I think they took Kayleigh
because they were trying to get to me.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.400
What do you mean, trying to get to you?

06:01.240 --> 06:02.080
Megan?

06:02.160 --> 06:04.960
That's just it, Dave.
I haven't always been Megan.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.800
What?

06:08.520 --> 06:09.480
Before we met…

06:11.480 --> 06:12.800
I was someone else.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.720
And I think that's why they took Kayleigh.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.640
Talk.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.640
Seriously, how can you,

06:29.720 --> 06:32.480
a known lover of stimulants,
not own a proper coffee machine?

06:34.560 --> 06:35.400
What?

06:36.720 --> 06:38.480
You said you remembered everything.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
Come on, then. What happened?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.040
No.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.720
-No.
-What are you doing?

06:50.800 --> 06:52.200
-You are not calling her.
-Mate!

06:52.280 --> 06:53.960
-Fester!
-No, Ray.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.760
I was happy to overlook
the whole casual breaking and entering

06:56.840 --> 06:58.000
to get to Cassie,

06:58.080 --> 07:00.360
but now the police are at her house.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.400
So whatever is going on with her,
you need to stay out of it.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.720
I need to talk to her.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.480
Why? It's been 20 years!

07:08.560 --> 07:10.400
She left you, mate.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.440
Extreme ghosted,
forget-I-ever-existed left you.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.600
Give me my phone.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.880
Ray, I don't like to speak ill of the dead
slash pretending to be dead,

07:19.640 --> 07:21.560
but you need to stay away from her.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.200
That woman is what the kids like to call
a crazy bitch!

07:24.280 --> 07:27.080
-Don't you fucking dare!
-So that's how it is, is it?

07:27.600 --> 07:31.080
Yeah? She shows up and suddenly
it's you and her against the world?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.400
Did you know she was alive?

07:33.440 --> 07:34.600
-What?
-You were there.

07:34.680 --> 07:38.200
You must have known where she went.
Have you been keeping her from me?

07:38.280 --> 07:40.040
-You… you're losing it.
-No, no, no.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.440
It's all starting to make sense to me now.
You knew she was alive.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.520
You lied to me and tried to cover it up,
just like you did everything else.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.480
Me and Cassie
need to work this out together.

07:49.560 --> 07:54.080
You and Cassie are over, dead, <i>finito.</i>
What you had together is gone!

07:55.920 --> 07:56.760
Ray.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.560
She is never coming back, Ray. Ever!

08:08.160 --> 08:11.040
Ta-da!
Ask and ye shall receive.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.560
Leanne has managed
to track down our rental IDs.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.040
The names they used were obviously fake,
but they had to use real pictures,

08:17.120 --> 08:20.240
so meet
our friendly neighborhood kidnappers.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.360
Look how young they are.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.480
They couldn't have been involved
in Stewart Green's disappearance.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.200
They'd have been about 12.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.840
What are they doing mixed up in this?

08:31.360 --> 08:32.320
What's that?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.440
It's Kayleigh Shaw's.
They found it outside the cabin.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.400
What?

08:36.680 --> 08:37.920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
It's the same jacket.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.880
Why the hell did Kayleigh Shaw
not tell us she was with Carlton Flynn?

08:55.040 --> 08:57.240
How long do
we have to stay here for?

08:57.320 --> 09:01.720
Just for a few days while the police
do their work at our house. Here we are.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.480
Okay?

09:45.840 --> 09:46.680
Kayleigh!

09:48.920 --> 09:51.600
<i>If this sounds serious,</i>
<i>that's because it is.</i>

09:52.120 --> 09:54.080
We believe that you are a key witness

09:54.160 --> 09:56.640
in the case
of Carlton Flynn's disappearance.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.240
So, Kayleigh, we need you
to be honest with us, okay?

10:04.440 --> 10:06.320
This is a photo of Carlton Flynn.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.360
This is you beside him, isn't it?

10:10.280 --> 10:12.040
We now have CCTV footage

10:12.120 --> 10:15.320
of you using a cash machine
around the corner from Vipers,

10:15.400 --> 10:17.840
and the bouncer has identified you

10:17.920 --> 10:20.600
as one of the girls
that entered with Carlton at 9:30.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.360
Did you go to Vipers with Carlton Flynn
on April the 16th?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.760
-How do you know Carlton Flynn?
-I don't.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.840
We met him outside.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.520
The plan was to use him to get in
and then ditch him.

10:34.040 --> 10:36.280
But he… tried to spike us.

10:36.880 --> 10:37.720
What?

10:38.760 --> 10:39.840
How do you know that?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.560
My friend Bea has
this nail varnish that shows you

10:42.640 --> 10:44.280
when there's something in your drink.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.600
Thank you!

10:48.920 --> 10:50.720
Maybe we should stop?

10:50.800 --> 10:53.000
No. We need to find out

10:53.080 --> 10:56.480
why she was one of the last people
to talk to a missing person.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.480
-No, Mum, it's fine.
-Go on.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.640
Well… that was it.
As soon as we found out what he'd done,

11:02.720 --> 11:05.040
we ditched him and went straight home.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.640
What Carlton did to you,
it's pretty serious.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.080
You know, and his disappearance
has been all over the news.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.840
You didn't think to mention it?

11:13.920 --> 11:16.160
I didn't know at first, and then,

11:16.240 --> 11:19.560
when we found out he was missing,
I didn't think we knew anything useful.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.080
But he was a total creep.
When we were at the bar,

11:23.160 --> 11:25.160
he kept arguing with someone, and--

11:25.240 --> 11:26.360
Wait. There was an argument?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.560
Who was he arguing with? A man, a woman?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.840
-I… I don't know. Just some guy.
-What did he look like?

11:32.920 --> 11:35.840
-I don't know. It was… it was dark.
-Think.

11:36.920 --> 11:42.120
He was… wearing a… a hoodie.
A pink hoodie. Um…

11:42.200 --> 11:43.880
He was East Asian.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.240
How long did the argument last?
How did it end?

11:46.320 --> 11:48.920
I… I don't know.
It was dark. I don't know anything!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.640
I think we should stop.
She's been through enough today.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.040
Kayleigh, listen to me.

11:59.040 --> 12:03.280
If you think there's anything else that
we should know, you need to tell us now.

12:04.120 --> 12:04.960
I mean it.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.000
Anything at all.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.080
No, that's everything.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.880
Okay, an officer will come
and check on you every day.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.080
Call me if you need anything.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.480
We've got a boat in a bottle
but no biscuits in the tin.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.880
-Why did you lie to the police?
-I didn't. Carlton did spike our drink.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.200
Which is horrifying,
and we'll come back to that later,

13:05.280 --> 13:06.800
but, Kayleigh…

13:07.320 --> 13:08.240
I know you.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.520
I know when you're hiding something.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.560
Listen, keeping secrets is exhausting.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.520
And it never works.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.080
The police aren't stupid.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Tell me the truth. What really happened?

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
I believe her.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.040
After what Tawny said about Carlton Flynn,

13:32.120 --> 13:35.560
then yeah, spiking young girls' drinks,
that seems totally plausible.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.000
But why are we only finding out
about it now?

13:38.080 --> 13:42.000
In over 50 witness statements, not one
mentioned an argument with Pink Hoodie.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.960
Right, so now we've got a link
between Kayleigh and Carlton.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.680
But that still doesn't tell us
anything about the kidnapping.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.440
And they took Kayleigh to get at Megan.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.160
I'm guessing that the kidnappers
didn't know that Kayleigh was at Vipers.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.680
We've only just found out.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.080
There's nothing to say they had access
to information that we didn't have.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.800
When was Harry killed?

14:08.800 --> 14:10.400
21st of April, was it?

14:11.720 --> 14:12.960
Yeah, April 21st.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.440
That's five days
after Carlton Flynn went missing.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.720
The day after Harry got in touch with us,

14:21.520 --> 14:25.840
which is exactly what happened with Megan.
She comes to the station to talk to us,

14:26.920 --> 14:31.480
and then a few hours later, someone
breaks into her house and takes Kayleigh.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.480
No.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.520
Yes.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.120
We've got a leak.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.960
<i> You have reached</i>
<i>DCS Brian Goldberg.</i>

14:41.040 --> 14:42.200
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

14:42.280 --> 14:45.280
Goldberg, I'm not paying you to ignore me.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.720
-You're in my home.
-And you're about to burn.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.360
Factor 50 okay?

15:06.440 --> 15:10.560
What? What the fuck are you two
playing at? I told you never to come here!

15:10.640 --> 15:13.680
And we told you
we don't approve of coarse language.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.520
I don't give
a fucking flying pig shit fuck!

15:17.120 --> 15:18.400
Where's my son?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.640
Our inquiries are ongoing.

15:22.640 --> 15:26.720
Well, my pockets aren't.
You want your money, bring him home.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.560
Oh.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.440
Your references were impeccable,

15:42.720 --> 15:44.040
so I know you're the best.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.200
And I know you'll do
what you need to do to find him.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.400
I want the next payment in our account
in an hour.

15:57.000 --> 15:57.840
Fine.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.280
Go back to Vipers.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.560
It all started there.

16:03.640 --> 16:04.840
See who's in charge.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.200
Ah!

16:19.880 --> 16:21.120
Business or pleasure?

16:22.400 --> 16:25.800
A witness gave us a new lead. I thought
Rudy might be able to identify him, but…

16:25.880 --> 16:27.240
-No dice, huh?
-No.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.880
-Rudy said you went to the doctor's.
-Oh, yeah. Great news. I'm cured.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.160
I know you don't want to talk about this,
but I found a place in Sweden--

16:42.240 --> 16:43.080
Oh God.

16:43.160 --> 16:47.200
Listen, I know you'll say it's a waste
of time, but they're doing this study.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.080
And, uh, the… the trials,
they're very early stages,

16:50.160 --> 16:52.600
but they're promising, you know?

16:53.120 --> 16:56.600
-It could buy you more time. Take a look.
-No. No.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.200
-Isn't it worth it if there's a chance?
-There's not. Not for me.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.840
This is my home.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.040
I built this place.
These girls are my family.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.960
I don't want to die miles away
on the other side of the world, all alone,

17:18.040 --> 17:21.040
because I spent my last few months
proving miracles aren't real.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.840
I chose you because you make me laugh,

17:29.520 --> 17:31.440
and I thought you knew the deal.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.000
You're my last hurrah.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.600
Last chance to feel alive.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.040
I love you. I really do.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.480
But if you just want to ignore reality
and chase the impossible,

17:49.560 --> 17:50.640
we're done here.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
Oh!

19:22.640 --> 19:24.040
Money's in!

19:24.120 --> 19:27.000
That means dream honeymoon's on the table.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.320
Galapagos Islands, here we come.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.160
-I do love a tortoise.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.360
What if we didn't come back?

19:36.880 --> 19:40.760
Not from the Galapagos, obviously,
but from the honeymoon.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.280
-What if we just kept traveling?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.240
Why?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.040
Well, you could have been killed
by that woman

19:49.120 --> 19:51.280
and her ridiculous mummy wagon.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.560
And we took a risk with the policeman.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.680
If he wasn't such a wuss,
God knows what could have happened.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.480
I hear early retirement's all the rage.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.720
But all couples have a thing.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.520
This is ours.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.880
-This is what we do.
-I know, I know.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.160
I know.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.360
But what if we didn't?

20:27.240 --> 20:30.160
Here we go. She must be the boss.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.240
Perhaps that detective
has told her something useful.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.520
When are you gonna stop
being angry with me?

21:14.600 --> 21:18.640
Well, you've been lying to me
for 17 years, so we've got a way to go.

21:19.680 --> 21:23.480
You know, you brought a psycho
into our lives and after our children.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.360
Who the fuck are you?

21:27.920 --> 21:29.400
Dave, you know who I am.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.040
-I don't even know your real name.
-It's Megan.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.480
But back before I met you,

21:40.440 --> 21:42.000
my other name was Cassie.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.680
But all the other stuff
I told you about my past,

21:47.240 --> 21:49.800
losing my parents, being alone,

21:50.520 --> 21:51.680
that was all true.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.600
I wasn't pretending.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.400
I was young

22:00.480 --> 22:03.800
and naive, and I got caught up
in a shitty situation

22:04.760 --> 22:06.440
with a man who used to hurt me.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.000
And then

22:12.440 --> 22:14.000
he was found dead one day.

22:15.480 --> 22:19.280
And I was terrified people would think
I had something to do with it, so I ran.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.440
I started over.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.920
That's it.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.200
Dead?

22:27.280 --> 22:30.120
-I had nothing to do with what happened.
-Hold on, hold on.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.080
So, some guy gets killed,

22:33.160 --> 22:36.880
so you decide to skip town,
pretend to be someone else,

22:36.960 --> 22:39.760
and then come
and fuck with me for nearly 20 years?

22:39.840 --> 22:43.120
-That's not what happened.
-What was I, a strategic relationship?

22:43.760 --> 22:46.520
Were we a family to hide behind
in case the police showed up?

22:46.600 --> 22:50.680
How can you expect me to believe
that everything that we built is real

22:50.760 --> 22:52.680
when you can hide
something like that from me?

22:52.760 --> 22:55.920
Because it wasn't
about hiding anything from you.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.280
It was about being with you.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.920
I loved being your Megan.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.880
So I shut Cassie away

23:07.400 --> 23:09.800
because I didn't want her
to ruin what we have.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.280
But now, I don't even know if he <i>was </i>dead.
And maybe he's sending people after us.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
When we get home,

23:21.320 --> 23:23.120
I think we should take some time apart.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.600
-I don't even know you anymore.
-Of course you do.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.040
You know me better than anyone.

23:31.640 --> 23:35.680
Even more now. You know it all.
I've told you everything.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.560
Dave, I know I've hurt you.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.520
I know I need to fix this.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.400
But our family is everything.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.880
Everything I've ever wanted.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.480
Isn't that all that matters?

23:54.120 --> 23:55.080
Do you know Megan?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.000
No. Do you?

23:59.080 --> 24:02.320
Let me ask you something.
How many times have you been engaged?

24:02.920 --> 24:05.640
-What?
-How many times have you been engaged?

24:07.040 --> 24:10.560
See, there… there was this, uh…
this guy that crashed my stag do,

24:10.640 --> 24:14.280
weird guy, kept going on and on,
asking questions about you.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.160
And then he said something. He said

24:17.840 --> 24:19.160
you'd been engaged before me.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
Were you?

24:28.280 --> 24:29.200
Wow.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.560
So much for telling me everything, yeah?

24:35.480 --> 24:36.320
Dave!

25:00.760 --> 25:03.120
<i>You have one new message.</i>

25:04.320 --> 25:06.480
<i>I know what happened</i>
<i>to Stewart Green.</i>

25:07.120 --> 25:09.960
<i>Meet me tomorrow at one o'clock,</i>
<i>at the head.</i>

25:11.000 --> 25:12.040
<i>No more running.</i>

25:45.400 --> 25:46.240
-Ah!

25:50.360 --> 25:52.280
<i>-Mama!</i>
-It's bedtime. Night, night.

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
-<i> Night, night, Mummy.</i>
-Bye. Bye.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.240
Yeah…

26:21.560 --> 26:23.680
Hey. Any luck?

26:23.760 --> 26:26.680
I've been through all of Priya's photos,
witness statements,

26:26.760 --> 26:31.080
even checked with the bouncers, but no one
remembers anyone wearing a pink hoodie.

26:32.080 --> 26:32.920
Hold on.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.840
There was a taxi. Did it have a dashcam?

26:36.920 --> 26:39.520
Yeah, yeah, but we checked that
when we were looking for Carlton.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.520
Nothing on it.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.560
<i>But you weren't looking</i>
<i>for a pink hoodie.</i>

26:42.640 --> 26:44.520
Get me footage from vehicles

26:44.600 --> 26:47.440
near the entrance to Vipers
the night Kayleigh was there.

26:47.520 --> 26:51.360
Okay, taxis, um… ambulances
with external cameras, anything like that.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.440
Yeah, sure. Will do.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.960
Uh… Got to go.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.960
Uniform have doorbell footage
from the Harry Sutton crime scene.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.720
-Can have a look now.
-Cool.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.760
How'd it go with Kayleigh Shaw?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.440
Uh, yeah, nothing interesting
to report.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.840
Tell you what,
you get off. I'll look at it.

27:09.920 --> 27:10.960
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
See you tomorrow.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.600
Do you know why Goldberg
was at Harry Sutton's place?

28:05.400 --> 28:06.360
Didn't know he was.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.520
No. Nor did I.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.800
Was just gettin' thirsty.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.760
<i>Hi.</i>

29:39.840 --> 29:41.560
Just because your progeny
doesn't understand

29:41.640 --> 29:43.240
the difference between night and day--

29:43.320 --> 29:44.360
Shut up!

29:44.440 --> 29:46.800
<i> Do you know why Goldberg</i>
<i>was at the crime scene?</i>

29:47.640 --> 29:49.600
-Goldberg?
-<i> Yeah. Something's up.</i>

29:49.680 --> 29:50.720
I'm leaving now.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.160
Ugh. It should be illegal
to be up at this hour.

29:53.680 --> 29:56.720
Says the woman who's pulled
more filthy all-nighters than Lucifer.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.720
-Mwah! See ya.
-Mmm. Bye.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.800
Nobody's heard from Goldberg
since yesterday.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.280
He was with Megan and her daughter
when he shouldn't have been.

30:09.360 --> 30:13.080
There's no valid reason for him
to remove evidence, so something's up.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.320
You've got a warrant?

30:14.400 --> 30:16.440
Yes, and the landlord
gave me his keys.

30:17.480 --> 30:22.120
Not quite the chic bachelor pad
I expected of Goldberg.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.240
Yeah, well,

30:23.920 --> 30:25.840
divorce cleaned him out, didn't it?

30:25.920 --> 30:27.360
His phone's still quiet?

30:27.440 --> 30:30.200
Nothing since he left the police station
yesterday morning.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.280
Professional Standards have got a team
trying to track him down.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.960
I mean, the man's been trying
to get into the Magic Circle for years.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.680
Can he really be
a part-time master criminal?

31:05.320 --> 31:07.080
The missing evidence bag.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.520
Magicians like to make things disappear.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.280
You okay?

31:44.600 --> 31:47.040
Didn't really hit me until today.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.600
Those people really wanted to hurt me.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.480
So did Carlton.

31:52.200 --> 31:56.480
If Bea hadn't been there and I'd drank
that drink, he could have done anything.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.400
But he didn't.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.920
And they didn't, and you're safe.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.840
What was it like?
When you used to work at Vipers?

32:06.440 --> 32:08.160
Did stuff like this happen to you?

32:09.280 --> 32:11.120
Not this exactly.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.480
But, um… yeah.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.120
There were some scary things.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.760
But that's not really
what I remember about working at Vipers.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.440
We were all one big family.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.840
Looked out for each other.
All in it together.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.240
Most of the time, it was a joy.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.200
I loved it.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.200
So why did you leave?

32:34.760 --> 32:38.520
There are some people out there
who will do some really crappy things.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.160
But there are also people out there

32:42.800 --> 32:46.160
who love you
and want to keep you safe… like me.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.000
-And Bea.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.080
You're not alone.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.800
-Okay?
-Yeah.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.520
Will you stay with me until Bea gets here?

33:02.440 --> 33:03.760
Yeah, of course.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.040
Someone saw you arguing
with Carlton Flynn at Vipers

33:25.120 --> 33:27.600
on April the 16th
shortly before he disappeared.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.040
How do you know Carlton?

33:30.000 --> 33:32.920
He's a friend of a friend. He knows
someone in my chemistry course.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.840
-You're a chemist?
-Studying to be one, yeah.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.040
When you met
with Carlton on April the 16th,

33:42.120 --> 33:43.520
was it to sell him drugs?

33:46.920 --> 33:47.760
No comment.

33:47.840 --> 33:50.920
You realize you're a suspect
in Carlton Flynn's disappearance

33:51.000 --> 33:52.280
and possible murder?

33:53.320 --> 33:56.240
I'm not sure that "no comment"
is the way you want to go.

33:56.320 --> 34:00.600
It's legal to produce gamma-Hydroxybutyric
as long it's not for recreational use.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.160
Besides, I don't sell it.

34:02.760 --> 34:06.240
-No money changes hands.
-Why were you arguing with Carlton?

34:08.400 --> 34:10.560
A witness saw you.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.560
I dunno. Uh…

34:14.080 --> 34:16.440
He was pissed off
about the amount or something.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.120
I only spoke to him for a few minutes.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.880
Me and my friends were out barhopping,
and they wanted to move on.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.280
Look, I can prove it.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.480
I spoke to Carlton, then we left.

34:24.560 --> 34:28.400
And then we went to Baumgart's Café
and then my mate's house.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.240
Look, my whole night's on camera.

34:30.320 --> 34:33.800
There's time stamps and everything.
Isn't that a major alibi or something?

34:34.800 --> 34:37.520
Whatever happened to Carlton
had nothing to do with me.

34:40.400 --> 34:44.320
This man, Guy Tatum,
he also went missing that night.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.120
He was later found dead.
Did you sell him anything?

34:47.200 --> 34:48.800
No. Uh…

34:48.880 --> 34:51.040
But I did see him
before I spoke to Carlton.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.440
Him and some guy was, like, going at it.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.360
Oi, oi, oi, oi!

34:56.040 --> 34:56.960
You saw

34:57.720 --> 35:00.000
this man, Guy Tatum,
fighting with someone?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.920
-Yeah.
-Who?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.040
-What did he look like?
-Uh…

35:05.120 --> 35:08.480
Tall, bedraggled.
Had a pretty fancy camera in his hand.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.160
Kind of clashed
with his hobo-on-the-edge vibes.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.440
-Was this him?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's him.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.000
-Police!
-Police!

35:26.080 --> 35:27.640
Ray Levine, show yourself!

35:28.600 --> 35:30.840
-Check upstairs.
-Clear!

35:31.520 --> 35:32.440
Clear!

35:34.800 --> 35:36.120
There's no sign of him.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.440
Great. We're still waiting
for a trace on his phone.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.440
Up here.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.360
Anything?

36:22.440 --> 36:23.320
Oh, yeah.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.080
Tramadol, fentanyl, nitrazepam.

36:28.280 --> 36:32.000
Carlton Flynn's credit card. Found it
under the driver's seat of the car.

36:32.520 --> 36:36.480
Why does Ray Levine have a credit card
belonging to a missing man?

36:53.640 --> 36:55.120
-What?
-Hey, man.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.600
The police were here looking for you.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.360
They're talking arrest.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.560
<i>I'm guessing it's not parking tickets.</i>

37:02.440 --> 37:04.680
<i>Look, whatever's going on with Cassie,</i>

37:05.720 --> 37:07.640
<i>you can't protect her anymore.</i>

37:08.400 --> 37:10.640
You need to go to ground, now.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.240
Rudy.

37:32.640 --> 37:33.640
What are you doing here?

37:34.160 --> 37:36.920
Now I know you killed Stewart
and took his money.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.200
What?

37:38.280 --> 37:41.040
For years, I thought
the two you had run away together.

37:41.800 --> 37:46.080
Now I know I was wrong. The money
Stewart hid, that was my money too.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.600
He still owed me my cut.

37:48.680 --> 37:49.920
I've been watching you.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.960
No sign of Stewart means you killed him
and kept the money for yourself.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.320
New lives don't come cheap.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.760
I didn't kill anyone.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.960
<i>I took some money from Stewart's safe</i>
<i>to get out of town.</i>

38:03.040 --> 38:06.240
<i>I left the rest for his wife.</i>
<i>I didn't know some of it was yours.</i>

38:13.240 --> 38:14.360
It was you.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.720
You gave my son that old Vipers flyer.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.840
-Yeah, well…
-Why?

38:19.920 --> 38:21.240
I missed you, darlin'.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.080
I just want my cut.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.000
The money is gone, Rudy.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.520
And I want you to stay
the fuck away from my family.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.760
Just checking everything's okay.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.640
Fine. I'm just going back inside.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.720
-Hiya.
-We've got a hit on Ray Levine's phone.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.760
I'm sending a team in now,
and I've just pinged you the location.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.840
Yeah, I'm close by. Heading there now.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.440
Cassie?

39:35.360 --> 39:37.600
Why are you after me and Cassie?
What do you want from us?

39:37.680 --> 39:40.440
Why were you meeting her here?
What's going on with you two?

39:40.520 --> 39:42.480
Tell me what really happened
to Stewart Green!

39:42.560 --> 39:46.160
-Was Cassie involved?
-No! No!

39:51.720 --> 39:52.920
I killed Stewart.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.200
He wouldn't leave her alone.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.800
Creepy pricks are an occupational hazard,
but he was different.

39:59.880 --> 40:04.080
He tried to hurt her, and I snapped.
I killed him, all right?

40:04.800 --> 40:05.640
He's dead.

40:06.200 --> 40:10.320
But Cassie had nothing to do with this,
so you can leave her and her family alone.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.080
It was all me.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.360
What about Guy? What about Carlton?

40:15.440 --> 40:17.800
We know you fought with Guy.
You stole Carlton's credit card.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.240
What… what credit card?
I didn't steal anything.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
What about the rest?

40:21.400 --> 40:23.400
-No.
-17 years of killing. All those families.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.480
-No! I didn't!
-They didn't deserve this!

40:27.200 --> 40:29.240
Ray Levine, I'm arresting you
for the murder--

40:34.760 --> 40:37.040
<i>Police detective</i>
<i>Brian Goldberg is being sought</i>

40:37.120 --> 40:39.520
<i>in connection with the suspected murder</i>
<i>of a local lawyer</i>

40:39.600 --> 40:42.040
<i>and the disappearance of a student.</i>
<i>Family members…</i>

40:42.120 --> 40:43.800
I've done something, Marl.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.280
The reward money?We can afford it.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.080
<i> While police are facing</i>
<i>urgent calls demanding answers</i>

40:50.160 --> 40:51.840
<i>on Detective Goldberg's involvement…</i>

40:51.920 --> 40:52.840
Something else.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.760
Look at me.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.920
Whatever it takes to bring your boy home.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.160
Yeah?

41:12.760 --> 41:13.720
No regrets.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.760
Whatever it takes.

41:24.760 --> 41:25.960
Here, sir.

41:26.040 --> 41:26.880
Thank you.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.240
-How you feeling?

41:29.320 --> 41:30.640
Like a fucking idiot.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.040
First Goldberg, now Ray Levine.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.960
Right in front of me.

41:37.680 --> 41:38.960
What else have I missed?

41:42.120 --> 41:45.320
There was this one weird thing, though.
He… he admits murder,

41:45.840 --> 41:51.160
then he made a big deal out of
not stealing Carlton Flynn's credit card.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.480
Since when is petty theft
an accusation too far?

41:59.880 --> 42:00.800
You okay?

42:04.680 --> 42:05.960
Lorraine has cancer.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.160
How bad?

42:15.480 --> 42:16.320
I'm sorry.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.040
What's in the folder?

42:22.120 --> 42:25.840
Yeah, we found something else
at Ray Levine's studio.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.480
The memory stick with all the photos
that he sent to us of the woods.

42:31.480 --> 42:35.120
He's been taking photographs of the woods
every year since Stewart disappeared.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.040
What?

42:38.080 --> 42:41.240
These are all dated April the 16th.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.240
If Carnival moves every year,
why have they all got the same date?

42:46.120 --> 42:48.720
Maybe he murders them during Carnival,
but then,

42:48.800 --> 42:52.600
the 16th is a special date to him,
so that's when he takes the photos?

42:52.680 --> 42:54.400
Why? Seems a bit complicated.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.600
Well, yeah.

42:55.680 --> 42:59.080
So is killing one person every year
and then getting rid of the body.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.720
Look at that.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.720
What is it?

43:09.640 --> 43:10.480
There it is again.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.680
Well, this is where it was.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.400
There. Tracks.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.000
It's a hand truck.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.360
Erin.

44:37.480 --> 44:38.480
It's a handle.

44:42.600 --> 44:43.440
Yeah.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.360
Oof.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.520
Okay.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.320
Jesus!

45:09.000 --> 45:10.040
Ugh!

45:18.000 --> 45:18.960
Jesus.

45:20.440 --> 45:21.760
All right.

45:26.920 --> 45:28.880
God's sake.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.640
-You all right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

47:03.960 --> 47:05.920
Tell me the truth. What really happened?
