It's a seduction scene.

How much, uh... is Joe getting?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.239
Five percent of the gross
until payoff.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.799
Then he goes to six percent. Twenty
percent of subsidiary rights...

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.083
- including a movie sale.
- (JULES) Thanks. That's good.

you know how I feel
about you, Jonesy.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.399
You've been like a father to me.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.967
And you a son to me.

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.999

I was just getting rid of it.

him a man in my condition...

Joe, what does it mean?

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.959
It means she's inherited
her mother's determination.

Dr. Ballinger, every time I've
seen him, I get the impression...

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.999
that he doesn't care
whether he lives or dies.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.959

Don't show them to me.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.039
when he won every possible award...

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:43.759
it would be nice to report that
Mr. Gideon's latest effort...

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.999
The Stand-up, starring
Davis Newman...

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.799
was a better film.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.039
- Oh, boy. Here it comes.
- The Stand-up, however,
does not quite stand up.

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.359
- Joey, turn it off, please.
- Leaning toward the frenetic, Gideon falls...

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.879
into his characteristic weakness
of trying too hard...

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.359
- to please, to entertain.
- I'm gonna turn that off.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.119
- Josh, no. I want to hear it.
- Slickness obscures reality.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.279
- The old razzle-dazzle obliterates drama.
- (JOSH) What the hell does she know?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.719
She never gave anything
a good review.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.879
That woman is totally unqualified
to criticize anything.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.199
She doesn't know
a goddamn thing about film.

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.879
- Or anything.
- She's not even reviewing a film.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.039
She's telling you
how clever she is!

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.839
where the has-been comic, played
impeccably by Davis Newman...

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.239
demonstrates
his former brilliance...

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.679
in a monologue where clearly...

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.239

Mr. Newman free rein.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.799
Rising above

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.439

- I don't care what she says.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.759

30 million domestic, at least.

Wh-What did you mean,
I learned too much from you?

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.519
You're gonna make it.
I'm hardly ever wrong.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.926
Thanks.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.479
You remember last Tuesday night?

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.479
It was raining...

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:20.599
very hard.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.565
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was raining.
What about it?

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.251
I called you at midnight.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.891
I must have been walking the dog.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.966
I don't have time
for this sort of thing.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.288
You were with someone.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.970
Yes.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.602
And you made love to him.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.770
Yeah.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.759
Well, that's it, huh?

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.645
- We're finished?
- I don't know.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:03.802
How do you feel about me?

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.639
I love you.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.491
Then I guess we're not finished.
(CHUCKLES)

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.330
Be-Because I really do
love you, Katie.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.119
- (WOMAN'S VOICE) You mean that?
- (JOE'S VOICE) Ah, hell, no!

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.759
I was pissed off at her.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.559
I don't know.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.279
Yeah, I did mean it. Sort of.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.802
Sometimes I don't know where the
bullshit ends and the truth begins.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.319
I just wanted to say
something nice to her.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.279
Why?

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.404

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.242
"In case."

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.761
In case.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.719

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.879

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.959
as stated in the declarations,
sustained directly and solely...

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.839
as the result of injury, sickness,
death of, or permanent disability...

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.519
Excuse me, Mr. Clark.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.690
Larry, give me our figures.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.199
Well, on an estimated
production budget...

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.039
of $941,000...

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.199
with a contingency of 59,000 to
round it out to the million...

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.959
so far we're in for at least
two-thirds of the fees.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.199
Design: 8,000. Costumes: 8,000.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.199
Electrics: 4,000.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.999
We're in for the full
director-choreographer: 15,000.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.919
Casting is another four.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.239
Construction of scenery...

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.399
where more than half
has been done...

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.399
that's 125,000-plus.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.559
Stage manager's about 8, 000.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.959
Press agent: 1,500.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.719
Musicians: about two.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.959
Assistants, secretaries,
et cetera: 3,000.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.359
Rehearsal halls
and auditions: 9,500.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:32.319
Script and administrative: 1,500.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.199
Managers: I'd say 10.

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.839
Advertising and printing:
about 20, 000.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.090
Orchestrations:
so far around 10,000.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.959
Legal: 10,000. Auditing: 2,000.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.079
Payroll taxes: maybe seven.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.679
Well, seven.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.119
Author's advances: 10,000.
Equity bonds: 50,000.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:01.799
Rehearsal salaries... and we've made
some advances to a few of the cast...

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.999
about 43,000.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.959
We're in for about, uh...

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.559
$480,500.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.199
Yes.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.199
That's the figure I had here.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.289
And change.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.719
(JONESY) Let me try to understand.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:22.799
Of that figure,
how much do we recoup?

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.399
I'm confused too. Do we get
all of that or part or what?

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.279
Simply, here are the options. One:

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.199
If Mr. Gideon recovers...

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.559
and you resume production
within the 180 days...

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.399
we are not liable for any of it.

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.799
Two: If Mr. Gideon should die...

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.959
and you resume production with another
director within the 180 days...

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:45.119
we are still not liable.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.959
Three, however:

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.079
If Mr. Gideon should expire
before February 1...

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.759
and you abandon production...

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.119
we are liable
for the full million dollars.

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.519
This means, gentlemen...

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.041
you could make a profit of...

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.887
$519,500.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.599
You could be
the first show on Broadway...

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.043
to make a profit
without really opening.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.889
Well...

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.051

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.199

Folks, what can I tell you
about my next guest?

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.599
This cat allowed himself...

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.039
to be adored but not loved...

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.599
and his success
in show business was matched...

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.039
by failure in his
personal-relationship bag.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.159
That's where he really bombed.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.399
And he came to believe
that work, show business...

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.839
love, his whole life,
even himself...

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.039
and all that jazz was bullshit.

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.519
He became numero uno game player...

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.919
to the point
where he didn't know...

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:01.999
where the games ended
and the reality began.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.519
Like, to this cat,
the only reality...

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.559
is death, man.

Ladies and gentlemen,
let me lay on you...

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.879
a so-so entertainer,
not much of a humanitarian...

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.439
and this cat
was never nobody's friend.

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:18.519
In his final appearance
on the great stage of life...
