[upbeat music]

08:19.934 --> 08:21.109
Where you goin'
so early, Cooper?

08:21.152 --> 08:24.068
I'll see you, I'm seeing
you at three, right?

08:24.112 --> 08:25.243
Hey, how are ya?

08:25.287 --> 08:26.549
- Jonah.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.811
- [Jonah] My man, how we
doin' there, you good?

08:27.855 --> 08:28.769
- Yeah, but not as
good as you, right?

08:28.812 --> 08:30.248
- Oh yeah.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.424
Being popular was
a new phenomenon.

08:32.467 --> 08:33.207
Hey guys.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.164
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:35.384 --> 08:38.561
- In what universe
would I be popular?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.568
Who is that in my office?

08:48.876 --> 08:49.616
Hi.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.442
- Oh.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.400
So sorry.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.097
Just checking out the view.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.142
- Yeah, I can see that.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.535
- I'm Sharon Lee.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.581
You're supposed to be training
me in the next few weeks.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.017
- Yes, right.

09:00.061 --> 09:00.844
That was today.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.019
Sorry, yeah, I'm Jonah.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.194
I am Jonah Smith.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.500
- Nice to meet you.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.894
I guess I should give
you your desk back.

09:06.937 --> 09:07.677
- That would be great.

09:07.721 --> 09:08.548
Thank you.

09:09.723 --> 09:10.941
Psychologists say
that women know

09:10.985 --> 09:12.029
if they will sleep with a man

09:12.073 --> 09:13.770
within moments of meeting him.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.556
It's biochemical
synergy, pheromones.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.036
The chemical secretion
released by the opposite sex

09:19.080 --> 09:21.038
that enhances
physical attraction.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.083
- I'm all yours.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.868
[Jonah chuckles]

09:25.739 --> 09:27.001
- Who's that?

09:27.044 --> 09:27.915
- That's just my
business advisor.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.831
She advises me on business.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.093
And other things.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.050
Hi.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.095
Final paperwork?
- It sure is.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.400
- [Jonah] Awesome.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.488
- Oh, you have company.

09:36.532 --> 09:37.925
Hi, I'm Sharon.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.187
- What a coincidence.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.145
I'm Sharon, too.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.582
[dreamy music]
- That's how she got her name:

09:42.625 --> 09:44.061
Sharon Two.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.846
- Oh wow, you're a Sharon.

09:45.889 --> 09:46.716
What are the chances?

09:46.760 --> 09:47.717
- Yeah.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.066
Sharon, this is Sharon.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.938
She's replacing me.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.896
Right from the training
program and into the fire.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.810
I'll be your guide, though.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.159
- Wow, well, congratulations.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.117
Very exciting.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.074
It's a great gig.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.336
- Thank you.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.425
I'm really looking
forward to it.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.690
[Jonah sighs]

10:03.733 --> 10:05.343
- Could we have
one second, Sharon?

10:05.387 --> 10:07.694
- Sure, no problem.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.738
- Thank you.

10:14.178 --> 10:16.659
So, that's your replacement?

10:16.703 --> 10:17.486
- Yeah.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.487
- She's beautiful.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.097
- What, what does that mean?

10:20.141 --> 10:22.143
- Come on, Jonah, you're
already sleeping with her?

10:22.186 --> 10:23.623
That is unbelievable.

10:23.666 --> 10:24.406
- I'm not.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.668
I'm totally not.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.887
I just met her like
a couple seconds ago.

10:26.930 --> 10:27.757
- Well, what do I know?

10:27.801 --> 10:28.802
You do move fast.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.108
But this has no concern to me.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.632
I'm not your girl.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.981
Sign here.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.809
The space is all yours,
and you're on your way.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.246
[Jonah exhales deeply]

10:38.289 --> 10:39.595
Congratulations.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.162
- Thank you very much.

10:41.205 --> 10:45.122
- Well, let me not keep you
from training your replacement.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.950
We're still on for
tonight, right?

10:46.994 --> 10:47.734
To celebrate?

10:47.777 --> 10:48.778
- Absolutely.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.606
- Great, see you then.

10:52.521 --> 10:55.829
[woman moaning]
[bed sprigs squeaking]

10:55.872 --> 10:58.353
[Jonah groans]

11:01.530 --> 11:03.837
See, now that's
how you celebrate.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.275
- [laughs] Yeah, it is.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.235
- Well, I better get outta here.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.065
I hate to hit and run.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.501
- What are you talkin' about,
you always hit and run.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.590
[Sharon laughs]

11:18.634 --> 11:20.201
- Um.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.334
You know, actually, I don't
have anything to do tonight.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.293
If you wanna maybe
order some Chinese food

11:25.336 --> 11:26.947
and watch some TV?

11:26.990 --> 11:28.426
- Oh.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.776
Uh.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.212
- No, you know what,
forget about it.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.822
- You sure?

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
- Yeah, no, you have things to
do, and I have things to do.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.173
So it's not a big deal.
- Okay, all right.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.219
- No biggie. [laughs awkwardly]

11:38.262 --> 11:39.046
No biggie.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.180
Okay, well, I guess
I'll call you again

11:43.224 --> 11:44.225
when I need some again, huh?

11:44.268 --> 11:45.226
- Like always.

11:45.269 --> 11:46.662
[man whimpering]

11:46.706 --> 11:47.924
- What is that?

11:47.968 --> 11:50.231
[man sobbing]
- I have no idea.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.580
- Will you do something?

11:51.623 --> 11:53.625
- Okay, okay, okay.

11:53.669 --> 11:54.844
Okay, hold on.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.760
- It's over there.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.196
- Yeah.
- Jonah, the arm.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.197
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.591
[curious music]

12:02.634 --> 12:03.810
Drew?

12:03.853 --> 12:05.115
[Sharon exhales deeply]

12:05.159 --> 12:06.290
What the hell are
you doin' here, man?

12:06.334 --> 12:07.465
I almost Louisville
Slugger'd you.

12:07.509 --> 12:08.902
- What do you mean
what am I doing here?

12:08.945 --> 12:09.816
You said I could stay
here for a couple of days

12:09.859 --> 12:11.295
until I figured something out.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.644
- Yes, I did say that.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.385
I said that, sorry.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.212
- Sharon.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.431
- Drew, how are you?

12:16.474 --> 12:17.998
- I am terrible, thank you.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.216
- Okay.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.348
- His girlfriend
is cheating on him.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.131
- Tell the whole
world, why don't you.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.045
- Sorry.
- Okay.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.307
- Are you going to use that bat,

12:23.351 --> 12:24.352
or can I use it to
smash my brains out?

12:24.395 --> 12:25.309
- I'm just gonna go.
- No.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.876
No, okay, yeah, I'll see you.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.225
- All right, bye.
- Sharon.

12:28.269 --> 12:29.400
- I'll call you.
- Is that how you cry?

12:29.444 --> 12:30.706
[energetic music]

12:30.750 --> 12:33.230
It's amazing how people
are always in a hurry,

12:33.274 --> 12:35.798
always rushing to get
somewhere in life.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.018
You have to wonder,
what's it all for?

12:38.061 --> 12:38.932
- What's the progress report?

12:38.975 --> 12:39.889
How am I doing?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.369
- Ooh, do I wanna be honest?

12:41.412 --> 12:42.674
- Brutally.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.241
- I don't think you need
me anymore. [laughs]

12:44.285 --> 12:45.852
I think you're ready.

12:45.895 --> 12:46.678
- Thanks.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.942
So that's basically it.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.465
My parents put me
through private school,

12:50.508 --> 12:53.337
and I rewarded them with a
full scholarship to college.

12:53.381 --> 12:56.384
And here I am, on
my way to the top.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.866
Tech world is small,
so me taking your job,

12:59.909 --> 13:01.476
that's good stuff.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.825
- Yeah, that's awesome.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.958
- Let's get off topic
a little bit here.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.437
- [laughs] Okay, yeah.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.352
- How long have you been
screwing your business advisor?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.746
[Jonah coughs]

13:10.790 --> 13:11.660
Are you okay?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.836
- Yeah, sorry, just, wrong pipe.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.359
Thank you.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.231
- I can be too direct.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.276
- Patron helps.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.017
[clears throat] Thanks.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.323
- So, how long?

13:22.366 --> 13:24.847
- [sputters] What makes
you think I'm having sex

13:24.891 --> 13:26.370
with my business advisor?

13:26.414 --> 13:27.284
- By the way you
two were looking

13:27.328 --> 13:28.416
at each other the other day.

13:28.459 --> 13:29.896
You two couldn't hide the fact

13:29.939 --> 13:32.333
that you guys are fucking,
even if you tried.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.638
- Well, for your information,

13:33.682 --> 13:37.381
I am not F-wording
my business advisor.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.208
- Why not?

13:38.252 --> 13:39.383
She's hot.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.864
A little old, but
still very hot.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.300
Is she good?

13:43.344 --> 13:44.301
- Really?

13:44.345 --> 13:45.215
You're being serious?

13:45.259 --> 13:46.651
- You can admit it.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.871
You're a grown man having
a grownup conversation

13:48.915 --> 13:50.264
with a grown woman.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.961
You could be honest with me.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.310
- No.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.529
Hmm-mm.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.880
I don't like to mix
business with pleasure.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.795
- Well, I think
it's time you did.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.362
- [scoffs] Excuse me?

14:01.405 --> 14:03.016
- Let's be honest.

14:03.059 --> 14:06.149
This job is stressful and
demands a lot of time.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.543
Which means any chance
of developing an
outside relationship

14:08.586 --> 14:12.155
with a decent individual
is slime to none.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.461
And since we're only
gonna be working together

14:13.504 --> 14:17.204
for another two,
2 1/2 weeks tops,

14:17.247 --> 14:18.640
why not?

14:18.683 --> 14:22.905
I'm not talking love, just
a matter of convenience.

14:22.949 --> 14:23.775
A release.

14:25.342 --> 14:29.477
I think a little business
with pleasure is good.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.521
So.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.002
What do you think?

14:34.221 --> 14:35.787
- Your place or mine.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
[energetic hip-hop music ]

14:37.441 --> 14:39.400
Two Sharons in one week.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.575
What are the odds of that?

14:40.618 --> 14:42.446
I'm a Trekkie, so
if I was Mr. Spock,

14:42.490 --> 14:44.448
I would calculate it as being,

14:44.492 --> 14:46.407
man, I'm weird sometimes.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.323
The things I think
about while having sex.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.281
Is it normal to think about
so many different things

14:51.325 --> 14:52.761
while having sex?

14:52.804 --> 14:55.285
It's like my
pseudo-mentor Tyrone said.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.417
- Listen up, Young Blood.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.158
The key to bein' a good lover,

14:58.201 --> 14:59.724
maintainin' and not
bustin' prematurely,

14:59.768 --> 15:00.943
you wanna know what it is?

15:00.987 --> 15:02.292
- Yes, please.

15:02.336 --> 15:02.989
- Oh, good, 'cause
I'm finna tell ya.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.338
- Okay.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.557
- While you all up in
there, gettin' it on,

15:06.601 --> 15:09.038
got your groove goin'
and feelin' good,

15:09.082 --> 15:11.519
don't ever, like Andre
3000 say, ever-ever--

15:11.562 --> 15:12.737
- Ever-ever.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.392
- Don't ever think
about how good it feels.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.828
That's a no-no.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.439
You think about your car.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.614
And then think about what
you're gonna do tomorrow.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.050
Organizing your taxes.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.748
Anything but what you're doing.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.359
Man, you've gotta
distract your mind.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.403
- I need to distract my mind.

15:26.447 --> 15:27.665
- It's all about the mind.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.580
'Cause while she's all
into it and goin' crazy,

15:29.624 --> 15:31.278
you've got to keep
your concentration.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.496
You've got to keep
your game on tight.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.410
- I've gotta keep it tight.

15:33.454 --> 15:34.411
- You've got to hold your load.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.760
- I'm gonna hold it.

15:35.804 --> 15:36.544
- You don't wanna
be no minute man.

15:36.587 --> 15:37.719
- No. [laughs]

15:37.762 --> 15:39.503
- The key is, think
about somethin' else.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.765
- [Jonah Voiceover] Wait.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.071
Is it odd, me thinking
about a black guy

15:42.115 --> 15:44.552
while having sex
with a hot girl?

15:44.595 --> 15:46.554
Yeah, that's kinds weird.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.817
Okay, somethin' else.

15:48.860 --> 15:52.516
What am I gonna eat
for lunch tomorrow?

15:52.560 --> 15:54.431
[Jonah groans]
[Sharon gasps]

15:54.475 --> 15:55.563
- Oh.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.566
- [Jonah] Oh my god. [laughs]

15:58.609 --> 16:00.220
- Okay, get up.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.003
Get off me.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.179
- [Jonah] Okay. [groans]

16:03.223 --> 16:06.443
- Wow, Jonah. [laughs]

16:06.487 --> 16:07.401
You are good.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.489
[Jonah chuckles]

16:08.532 --> 16:10.534
But now you gotta go.

16:10.578 --> 16:11.666
- Already?

16:11.709 --> 16:12.449
- Let me catch my
breath first, huh?

16:12.493 --> 16:13.450
- No can do, Jonah.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.451
No can do.

16:14.495 --> 16:15.800
I need my beauty rest.

16:15.844 --> 16:19.543
And American Idol's on
in 15 minutes, so hey.

16:24.461 --> 16:25.723
Come on!
[Jonah cries out]

16:25.767 --> 16:27.160
Let's go!
- Okay!

16:28.074 --> 16:28.900
Okay.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.555
- Bye, I'll see you tomorrow.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.861
- Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll, uh--

16:32.904 --> 16:33.644
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow at--

16:33.688 --> 16:35.168
[door slams]

16:35.211 --> 16:38.432
[curious music]

16:38.475 --> 16:40.303
I guess you can say,
from that point on,

16:40.347 --> 16:43.828
Sharon Two and I developed a
particular after-work routine.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.134
- I'm stressed.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.832
[energetic hip-hop music]

16:47.876 --> 16:49.443
[speech drowned out by music]

16:49.486 --> 16:50.618
- Look at me!
- I'm looking at you.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.662
I'm looking.
- Look at me!

16:51.706 --> 16:53.186
- Look, I can't
without my glasses.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.404
[speech drowned out by music]
No idea what that means.

16:54.448 --> 16:55.971
- Don't stop!
- Okay, yeah, great.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.364
- What are you doing later?

16:57.407 --> 16:58.800
[energetic hip-hop music]

16:58.843 --> 17:00.149
Oh yeah.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.281
Uh-huh.

17:01.324 --> 17:02.760
Oh, uh-huh.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.588
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.373
Yeah, oh my god, to the left.

17:06.415 --> 17:07.329
The the left.
- There?

17:07.374 --> 17:08.156
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.157
- Do the swirl.
- Okay.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.507
- Oh, do it right.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.031
You better do it right.
- Do it right.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.597
- Do it right!

17:13.641 --> 17:14.685
- So why don't you hand
it to me, I'll review it,

17:14.729 --> 17:15.991
and I'm sure it's
gonna be great.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.513
Uh, and we'll see where
to take it from there.

17:17.558 --> 17:18.602
- That sounds good.

17:18.646 --> 17:19.646
I'm gonna go to the restroom.
- Deal.

17:19.690 --> 17:20.865
Okay, cool.
- Okay.

17:20.909 --> 17:21.648
Bye.
- I'll see at lunch.

17:21.692 --> 17:22.563
Bye.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.086
[energetic hip-hip music]

17:24.130 --> 17:27.568
[tranquil exotic music]

17:31.006 --> 17:33.922
Energy supplements are crucial
when engaging in copulation

17:33.965 --> 17:37.273
at such high
frequencies as I was.

17:37.317 --> 17:38.666
This is enough, right?

17:38.709 --> 17:40.146
Who was I kidding.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.539
I couldn't keep up this pace.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.063
I needed a getaway.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.678
- Hello, would you like
another cappuccino?

17:50.721 --> 17:52.027
Okay, awesome.
- And just when I thought

17:52.071 --> 17:54.551
I'd found the perfect
hideaway spot, it happened.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.552
That's when I ran into her.
- Awesome.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.293
[woman gasps]

17:57.337 --> 17:58.555
- [Jonah Voiceover] Or
rather, she ran into me.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.687
- Oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.210
I cannot believe I just--

18:01.254 --> 18:02.124
- [Jonah] That's all right,
it's all right, it's--

18:02.168 --> 18:02.907
- No, no, it's not all right.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.213
I've ruined your jacket.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.475
I will pay for the dry cleaning.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.389
- It's not a big
deal, it's fine.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.564
It's okay, really, it's okay.

18:07.608 --> 18:08.565
- Wait, wait, wait.

18:08.609 --> 18:09.479
Don't leave.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.220
Um, let me make it up to you.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.134
- It's okay, it's cool.

18:12.178 --> 18:12.874
Thank you, though.

18:12.917 --> 18:13.788
- Are you sure?

18:13.831 --> 18:15.224
I mean the coffee here is great.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.313
And we have the best
red velvet whoopie pies.

18:17.357 --> 18:20.316
And the absolute best retro
psychedelic feel ever.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.232
[faint rock music]

18:24.320 --> 18:26.017
- What movie is that?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.541
- Dolemite.

18:27.584 --> 18:28.629
Rudy Ray Moore.
- Yeah.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.760
- It's badass.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.240
We've got kung-fu,
even Elvis flicks.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.589
Everything retro.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.200
- [Jonah Voiceover]
That's when I knew

18:34.243 --> 18:36.289
she was something special.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.291
- For fuckin' with
me, you no-business,

18:38.334 --> 18:40.728
born-insecure motherfuckers.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.686
- Hi, sorry.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.732
[plates clattering]
[woman gasps]

18:44.775 --> 18:46.125
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.388
I, I cannot that I
just did that again.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.520
- Okay, it's good coffee.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.612
Yeah, and the whoopie
pie's delicious, too.

18:55.656 --> 18:56.744
Look, I know you
guys just opened.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.614
You probably just
started workin' here.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.225
But I gotta talk to the manager.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.182
I'm sorry.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.662
- No, I, I totally understand.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.185
Just give me two seconds
and I'll get her,

19:03.229 --> 19:04.099
okay?
- All right.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.536
- I'm really sorry, I just...

19:09.757 --> 19:11.280
Hi, I'm the manager.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.107
- You're the manager?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.761
- And the owner.

19:13.804 --> 19:14.588
How are you, sir?

19:14.631 --> 19:15.632
- This is your place.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.156
- Yep, all mine.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.897
I'm really sorry, again, for
just spilling coffee on you

19:19.941 --> 19:22.117
and putting a whoopie
pie in your lap.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.771
Just give me one
more chance, okay.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.207
I feel terrible.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.166
- Yeah, one more chance.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.471
One more chance.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.864
- Sometimes third
time's the charm.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.170
- Yeah, sometimes.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.649
- I, uh, I didn't
catch your name.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.478
- Sorry, I'm [chuckles] Jonah.

19:35.522 --> 19:36.262
- Hi Jonah, I'm--

19:36.305 --> 19:37.654
- Sharon, three.

19:37.698 --> 19:38.960
[gentle music]

19:39.003 --> 19:40.353
- [Jonah Voiceover] Her
name was Sharon Hudson.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.269
But I just called
her Sharon Three.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.187
- Three what?

19:48.230 --> 19:49.100
- The guy's coming
tomorrow at three

19:49.144 --> 19:50.319
to fix the wireless router.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.625
- Three, I need him
to come earlier.

19:51.668 --> 19:52.669
Okay, not your fault.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.193
Just hold on one second, okay.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.064
Um, I will be right
back with your coffee.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.631
I just need to handle that,

19:57.674 --> 19:59.110
otherwise I'm gonna have to
take down that free Wi-Fi sign.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.547
- Okay.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.810
What are the odds of
having not one or two

20:02.853 --> 20:05.943
but three hot
Sharons in my life.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.771
What is the universe
trying to tell me.

20:07.815 --> 20:08.729
- Hey, steady feet.

20:08.772 --> 20:09.817
- Uh-oh.
- Steady feet.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.992
- Here she comes.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.167
Here she comes, almost there.

20:12.211 --> 20:12.950
You're almost there.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.256
- Almost there.

20:15.605 --> 20:16.824
- Hey.
- Ta-da.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.304
- There you go.
- Third time's the charm.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.696
And I brought you some of these.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.132
- Thank you.
- You might need a couple.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.046
- Thanks.
- The very least I can do

20:22.090 --> 20:23.265
is pay for your dry cleaning.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.701
- Hmm-mm, not a big deal.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.181
Um.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.138
But I have been
thinkin' about a way

20:27.182 --> 20:28.227
maybe you could pay me back.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.576
- Is that so?

20:29.619 --> 20:30.533
- Yeah, yeah, sit
down, hear me out.

20:30.577 --> 20:31.708
Just give me a couple minutes.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.319
- You've got two,
it's gettin' busy.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.843
All right, now, how do you
propose I pay you back?

20:35.886 --> 20:36.931
- Have dinner.

20:36.974 --> 20:37.714
- Really?

20:37.758 --> 20:39.455
- With a friend of mine.

20:39.499 --> 20:40.282
- Your friend?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.240
- Yeah, hear me out.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.719
Look, he's not ugly, okay.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.243
He's not a loser or
anything like that.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.853
He's just been
buried in his work

20:45.896 --> 20:47.855
and he hasn't really hit
the dating game in awhile.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.335
Like two weeks.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.161
- Two weeks?

20:50.205 --> 20:51.250
- Two years.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.251
Two years.

20:52.294 --> 20:52.990
Did I say two weeks?

20:53.034 --> 20:53.904
I meant two years.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.558
It just feels like yesterday

20:55.602 --> 20:57.691
that he was banngin' on my
door, crying his eyes out.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.909
- Oh, that's awful.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.868
- Yeah, it is terrible.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.218
And I think you
might be the girl

21:03.262 --> 21:05.916
to break him out of his funk.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.483
This is just a date.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.050
You're acting like you're
goin' to the dentist.

21:09.093 --> 21:10.573
- I keep telling you that I'm
not ready to be dating again.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.140
- Okay, well, we're gonna
have to do somethin' here.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.881
Okay, you've gotta get
your mind of of Heather.

21:13.924 --> 21:16.884
And this girl,
okay, she's sharp.

21:16.927 --> 21:17.798
She's pretty.

21:17.841 --> 21:18.886
She owns her own business.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.235
Okay, she's got
her act together.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.758
Hey, if anything, you
should be thanking me

21:21.802 --> 21:23.499
for hooking you guys up.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.022
She's perfect.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.067
- Well, if she's so perfect,
why aren't you dating her?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.677
- I mean, I could, I could.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.637
I just, I'm not ready
to date a girl like her.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.507
Not yet anyway.

21:31.551 --> 21:32.769
- That's interesting.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.162
So what makes you
think that I'm ready

21:34.205 --> 21:35.903
to date a girl like that?

21:35.946 --> 21:37.296
- Well, [stammers].

21:37.339 --> 21:38.297
- Exactly.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.254
I'm outta here.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.777
- Hold up, man, where are goin'?

21:40.821 --> 21:41.604
- I'm getting out of here,
would you let go of me, please.

21:41.648 --> 21:42.910
- No, man, not yet.

21:42.953 --> 21:43.867
I mean, you have to
meet her at least.

21:43.911 --> 21:44.999
- I'm out, and you know what?

21:45.042 --> 21:46.609
Her name is Sharon,
okay, it's weird.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.871
It's like that name is
your fetish or something.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.264
- Maybe that was it.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.266
Some people have a hand
fetish or a feet fetish.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.007
[man groans lasciviously]

21:53.050 --> 21:54.748
Could it be that I
have a name fetish?

21:54.791 --> 21:55.662
Drew, stop.

21:55.705 --> 21:56.880
I will kick you out of my house

21:56.924 --> 21:58.142
if you do not meet this girl.

21:58.186 --> 21:58.926
- Get off of me!
- I'm getting off of you.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.188
Sit down.

22:00.231 --> 22:00.928
You're gonna have one drink.
- You're crazy.

22:00.971 --> 22:01.798
I've had nine.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.234
Just get off me.
- No, man.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.453
- We look crazy right now.

22:04.497 --> 22:08.631
- [laughs softly] You
two do look crazy.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.053
- She's a bad bitch.

46:35.096 --> 46:35.880
- She a bad bitch?

46:35.923 --> 46:37.403
You gotta do you.

46:37.446 --> 46:38.883
You like her her?

46:38.926 --> 46:41.886
Then fuck what me or anybody
else got to say about it.

46:41.929 --> 46:45.237
Just you and she
against the world, baby.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.978
[glasses clinking]
[forceful exhaling]

46:47.021 --> 46:48.501
Can you dig it?

46:48.544 --> 46:50.895
- That was it, I
was gonna tell them.

46:50.938 --> 46:53.593
Sharon One, Sharon
Two, I'm done, man.

46:53.636 --> 46:54.420
I'm a one-woman man.

46:54.463 --> 46:55.290
- Good for you, man.

46:55.334 --> 46:56.422
I am proud of you.

46:56.465 --> 46:58.250
That is the shit right there.

46:58.293 --> 46:59.425
Man, that's what's up.

46:59.468 --> 47:00.861
That's what's up.

47:00.905 --> 47:02.297
- [Jonah Voiceover] It's
amazing the clarity you get

47:02.341 --> 47:04.430
once you've made
the right decision.

47:04.473 --> 47:06.736
It's also amazing the
complication that come

47:06.780 --> 47:09.609
to your life the moment you
decide to do what's right.

47:09.652 --> 47:11.698
- Sharon, why did you bring
me to this coffee shop?

47:11.741 --> 47:13.004
I thought you were
gonna show me the reason

47:13.047 --> 47:14.657
why Jonah's been
ignoring us lately.

47:14.701 --> 47:16.181
- And I am.

47:16.224 --> 47:19.053
She's standing right there,
right in front of us.

47:19.097 --> 47:21.316
- Stop it, another woman?

47:21.360 --> 47:24.493
- I followed him
here the other day.

47:24.537 --> 47:27.322
And that's not the
only surprising thing.

47:27.366 --> 47:28.497
Um, excuse me, miss.

47:28.541 --> 47:29.672
- Oh, hi, how are you?

47:29.716 --> 47:30.717
How can I help you ladies?

47:30.760 --> 47:32.023
- Well, Sharon.

47:33.154 --> 47:34.416
My name is Sharon.

47:34.460 --> 47:37.376
And my friend's name
here is also Sharon.

47:38.899 --> 47:40.901
- [laughs awkwardly] Well, wow.

47:40.945 --> 47:43.208
That's, um, that's odd.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.905
I can't say I've
ever met two Sharons

47:44.949 --> 47:46.341
at the same time before.

47:46.385 --> 47:47.516
- Right?

47:47.560 --> 47:49.083
- We certainly have
something in common.

47:49.127 --> 47:51.477
- Well, see, that's not the
only thing we have in common.

47:51.520 --> 47:52.957
- What else do we
have in common?

47:53.000 --> 47:54.480
- Um, do you wanna?

47:55.568 --> 47:57.178
- This is awkward.

47:58.527 --> 47:59.964
- Jonah.

48:00.007 --> 48:02.836
We all happen to
date Jonah Smith.

48:04.490 --> 48:07.232
- Seriously, is this like some
sort of joke or something?

48:07.275 --> 48:08.059
- No.

48:09.016 --> 48:09.799
- I'm sorry.

48:09.843 --> 48:10.626
Uh.

48:11.801 --> 48:13.412
I don't, I don't
think I understand.

48:13.455 --> 48:18.417
Uh, you're telling me that
you two are also seeing Jonah?

48:20.767 --> 48:22.943
- I feel so liberated
right now, man.

48:22.987 --> 48:24.553
I'm about to start a whole
new chapter of my life.

48:24.597 --> 48:26.512
- It's beautiful.

48:26.555 --> 48:27.600
Whoa, whoa, dude, dude.

48:27.643 --> 48:29.950
Are seeing what I'm seeing?

48:32.083 --> 48:33.823
- What the fuck?

48:33.867 --> 48:34.607
Game over.

48:35.956 --> 48:38.437
My world has just
come to an end.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.788
- And now you're just the
latest addition to the equation.

48:41.831 --> 48:45.531
So, I'm sorry that we had to
break it down to you like this.

48:45.574 --> 48:48.012
- Well, um, thanks for,

48:48.055 --> 48:50.449
for telling me, I guess.

48:50.492 --> 48:51.493
- Oh, no.

48:51.537 --> 48:52.494
Oh, you're not
gonna cry, are you?

48:52.538 --> 48:53.582
Let's not.

48:53.626 --> 48:54.540
I mean, it's like,
in public and--

48:54.583 --> 48:56.455
- No, no, no, I'm good.

48:56.498 --> 48:57.282
Hey, I'll be fine.

48:57.325 --> 48:58.065
Thank you, though.

48:58.109 --> 48:58.979
I, uh--

48:59.023 --> 49:00.546
- Well, well, sit back down.

49:00.589 --> 49:02.852
Because we a
proposition for you.

49:02.896 --> 49:04.071
- We do?
- We do.

49:04.115 --> 49:05.551
- Fuck!

49:05.594 --> 49:06.813
- Didn't I fucking tell you
this would catch up to you?

49:06.856 --> 49:09.468
- Well, we can work this
out, the three of us.

49:09.511 --> 49:10.991
- I'm so fucked.

49:11.035 --> 49:11.992
I'm so fucked right now.
- Told you it would catch up.

49:12.036 --> 49:13.646
- It could be, it...

49:14.995 --> 49:16.518
Oh, well, maybe the four of us.

49:16.562 --> 49:18.477
Look who's here.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.000
Hi.

49:20.044 --> 49:21.045
- Should I run?

49:21.088 --> 49:22.089
- Uh, maybe.

49:23.525 --> 49:24.918
- [Jonah Voiceover]
Definition of cowardice:

49:24.962 --> 49:27.399
timidity, lack of bravery.

49:27.442 --> 49:28.443
I didn't run.

49:28.487 --> 49:29.836
It's not that I was brave.

49:29.879 --> 49:31.969
It's just that my
legs couldn't move.

49:32.012 --> 49:32.839
I froze.

49:34.493 --> 49:35.624
- Excuse me a moment, will you?

49:35.668 --> 49:37.278
- Yeah, of course.

49:38.845 --> 49:39.715
[Jonah cries out]
- Jonah!

49:39.759 --> 49:42.805
How could you do this, Jonah?

49:42.849 --> 49:44.329
Three Sharons?

49:44.372 --> 49:46.461
What kind of sicko are you?

49:46.505 --> 49:47.593
- It just sorta happened.

49:47.636 --> 49:49.464
- It just, it just
sort of happened.

49:49.508 --> 49:51.075
It just sort of happened?

49:51.118 --> 49:53.947
Three Sharons, and
I'm number three.

49:53.991 --> 49:56.471
You're a fucking asshole, Jonah!

49:56.515 --> 49:58.473
- Oh, that's really, there's
really anger in there.

49:58.517 --> 49:59.735
- I hate you.

49:59.779 --> 50:02.434
Don't you ever speak
to me, not ever again.

50:02.477 --> 50:03.217
God.

50:03.261 --> 50:04.044
- Sharon.

50:05.045 --> 50:06.394
Sharon!

50:06.438 --> 50:07.482
Sharon, wait.

50:07.526 --> 50:08.657
Sharon, come on.

50:08.701 --> 50:10.181
We're done, it's over.
- What?

50:10.224 --> 50:11.095
- Sharon.
- Are you okay?

50:11.138 --> 50:12.052
- Do not let him back here.

50:12.096 --> 50:13.314
- Sharon!
- Hey.

50:13.358 --> 50:14.054
Um, can I help you
with something?

50:14.098 --> 50:15.099
- Sharon, Sharon.

50:15.142 --> 50:15.925
Wait, Sharon.

50:15.969 --> 50:17.275
- I didn't think so.

50:17.318 --> 50:19.668
I think you need to leave, dude.

50:19.712 --> 50:20.539
Go.

50:27.546 --> 50:31.071
- Well, that didn't go
exactly how I envisioned it.

50:31.115 --> 50:32.377
- Do you think?

50:35.423 --> 50:37.599
- Sharon, I'm just gonna
give you space, okay.

50:37.643 --> 50:39.862
I'm, I'm, I'm not
gonna call you back.

50:39.906 --> 50:40.820
I won't call you back.

50:40.863 --> 50:42.474
You call me when you're ready.

50:42.517 --> 50:43.562
This is the last you're
gonna hear from me, okay.

50:43.605 --> 50:47.087
This is, um, I
won't call you back.

50:47.131 --> 50:47.914
Sharon.

50:47.957 --> 50:48.697
Sharon, it's me again.

50:48.741 --> 50:49.785
Um, call me back.

50:49.829 --> 50:50.569
Huh, please?

50:50.612 --> 50:52.136
Um, I just wanna talk.

50:52.179 --> 50:54.529
Hey, uh, Legend of a
Fighter was on earlier.

50:54.573 --> 50:56.096
I, uh, I thought of you.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.228
I just wanna explain.

50:57.271 --> 50:59.926
Call me, please, call me.

50:59.969 --> 51:01.493
If you don't call me back soon,
I'm gonna start having to go

51:01.536 --> 51:03.973
to a different
coffee shop. [laughs]

51:04.017 --> 51:05.497
[phone thudding]

51:05.540 --> 51:06.846
Sharon, it's me again, okay.

51:06.889 --> 51:08.500
Please, please call me.

51:08.543 --> 51:12.417
I, uh, I can't think
about anything else.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.244
I'm sorry.

51:14.462 --> 51:17.117
I, I just wanna make
this right, okay.

51:17.161 --> 51:20.599
Call me, just, I
just wanna talk.

51:20.642 --> 51:21.600
I just wanna talk.

51:21.643 --> 51:22.644
Um.

51:24.603 --> 51:26.518
I miss you, I don't--

51:26.561 --> 51:28.955
[phone thuds]

51:38.704 --> 51:40.227
- Oh.

51:40.271 --> 51:41.881
Look at him.

51:41.924 --> 51:42.882
Look at him.

51:44.275 --> 51:45.624
Hey buddy.

51:45.667 --> 51:47.016
- She doesn't wanna talk to me.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.583
- It hurts, right?

51:48.627 --> 51:50.281
Right in the heart.

51:50.324 --> 51:53.110
You know, the odd thing is
that seeing you so upset,

51:53.153 --> 51:55.590
I don't feel half as
bad about my life.

51:55.634 --> 51:57.810
I guess misery really
does love company.

51:57.853 --> 52:01.683
So we're in this
together. [chuckles]

52:01.727 --> 52:02.815
Oh, I'm, I'm,

52:02.858 --> 52:04.599
I'm sorry, I'm just
thinking out loud.

52:04.643 --> 52:05.426
- You're an asshole.

52:05.470 --> 52:06.340
- Indeed.

52:06.384 --> 52:07.515
- Did I say that out loud,

52:07.559 --> 52:08.429
or was I just thinking
that out loud?

52:08.473 --> 52:09.648
- That was out loud.

52:09.691 --> 52:10.736
That's a valid
point, good point.

52:10.779 --> 52:11.606
Oopsies.

52:11.650 --> 52:12.607
Sorry.

52:12.651 --> 52:13.826
Oops.

52:13.869 --> 52:14.740
- Good.

52:14.783 --> 52:16.176
- Do you want some ice cream?

52:16.220 --> 52:17.090
- Yes, please.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.657
- Nah, I'll get some smoothies.

52:18.700 --> 52:19.832
We'll work on it.

52:19.875 --> 52:21.181
Okay?

52:21.225 --> 52:22.051
- Sharon!

52:23.575 --> 52:24.663
Sharon!

52:24.706 --> 52:25.881
Sharon!

52:25.925 --> 52:30.669
[energetic music]
[Jonah breathes heavily]

52:30.712 --> 52:31.539
Sharon!

52:32.714 --> 52:33.802
Sharon!

52:33.846 --> 52:36.065
[pounding on door]
Sharon.

52:36.109 --> 52:37.632
Sharon.

52:37.676 --> 52:39.286
Sharon.

52:39.330 --> 52:40.766
Sharon.

52:40.809 --> 52:42.289
Hi.
- What do you want, Jonah?

52:42.333 --> 52:43.595
- I just want to explain.

52:43.638 --> 52:45.640
- I promised myself
after my dad died no one

52:45.684 --> 52:46.772
would hurt me like that.
- I know, but--

52:46.815 --> 52:48.513
- I let you in, and
you did just that!

52:48.556 --> 52:49.731
- I know, Sharon,

52:49.775 --> 52:50.732
and I'm sorry, I'm--
- I asked you if you

52:50.776 --> 52:52.647
were seeing anyone.

52:52.691 --> 52:53.387
And you lied.

52:53.431 --> 52:54.649
- Yeah.

52:54.693 --> 52:56.303
- You lied, Jonah.
- Yeah, I know.

52:56.347 --> 52:57.870
- All you had to do
was be honest with
me, but you couldn't.

52:57.913 --> 52:59.132
- No, Sharon, I--
- Stop!

52:59.176 --> 53:01.700
Let me finish, I
wanna get this out.

53:01.743 --> 53:03.354
Now, I know I shouldn't
be this upset.

53:03.397 --> 53:04.224
I mean, I've known you what,

53:04.268 --> 53:05.660
like six weeks?
- Yeah.

53:05.704 --> 53:07.445
- But those have been the
best six weeks of my life.

53:07.488 --> 53:09.055
- Me too.
- Jonah, I swear to God,

53:09.098 --> 53:10.883
I will shut this door and walk
away if you keep on talking.

53:10.926 --> 53:12.363
- Okay.

53:12.406 --> 53:14.669
[heartbreaking music]

53:14.713 --> 53:15.801
- I am so hurt.

53:18.934 --> 53:21.154
You really hurt me, Jonah.

53:22.590 --> 53:24.679
I mean, and those other
two Sharons wanted

53:24.723 --> 53:27.726
to work me into this sick
sex schedule that you had.

53:27.769 --> 53:29.075
And I declined.

53:30.642 --> 53:31.643
You're sick.

53:32.470 --> 53:34.123
You deserve each other.

53:34.167 --> 53:35.864
I am done with you.

53:36.822 --> 53:38.432
I don't ever wanna
see you again.

53:38.476 --> 53:42.262
Is there anything you
wanna add before you go?

53:42.306 --> 53:44.569
- Do you remember, do you
remember we were outside?

53:44.612 --> 53:47.485
And you asked me
what I was afraid of?

53:47.528 --> 53:49.051
I thought about it.

53:49.095 --> 53:49.878
It's love.

53:51.271 --> 53:52.446
Okay, I'm afraid of love,

53:52.490 --> 53:53.708
because I, I don't
think I know what it is.

53:53.752 --> 53:54.753
- Spare me, Jonah.

53:54.796 --> 53:56.015
- I was bullied.

53:56.798 --> 53:59.540
As a kid, I was bullied.

53:59.584 --> 54:01.803
By all different people.

54:01.847 --> 54:04.806
But it was, it was
mostly this one guy.

54:04.850 --> 54:05.851
Nick Kowalski.

54:07.331 --> 54:09.855
I mean, it was every day
after school, without fail.

54:09.898 --> 54:11.117
I mean, it got to the
point where I would,

54:11.160 --> 54:12.727
I would just see him,
and I would start,

54:12.771 --> 54:13.989
I would start shaking.

54:14.033 --> 54:16.383
I have nightmares just
thinking about this guy.

54:16.427 --> 54:18.559
[breaths raggedly]

54:18.603 --> 54:19.517
So what am I afraid of?
