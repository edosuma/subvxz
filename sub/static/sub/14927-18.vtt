WEBVTT

00:05.306 --> 00:07.175
HEY, LILY, WHAT'S
WITH THE SNAZZY JACKET?

00:07.208 --> 00:08.709
I JOINED A CLUB
AT SCHOOL.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.179
YOU? YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
A CLUB JOINER.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.547
WELL, NOW I'M IN
THE SCIENCENAUTS.

00:13.581 --> 00:14.715
THE SCIENCE NUTS?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.817
SO YOU'RE NUTS
ABOUT SCIENCE, HUH?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.752
IT'S NOT NUTS,
IT'S NAUTS.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.455
YEAH, I JUST FIGURED
IT WAS LIKE ASTRONUTS.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.124
THAT'S ASTRONAUTS.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.059
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.498
SO YOU'RE EXPECTING
COMPANY, HUH?

00:30.531 --> 00:31.532
YES, I AM.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.601
YOU ARE LOOKING AT
THE NEW PRESIDENT

00:33.634 --> 00:35.236
OF THE ST. FINNIAN'S
PARENTS COMMITTEE.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.605
HA HA.
WHAT'S THE GAG?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.574
I CANNOT TELL A LIE.

00:40.608 --> 00:45.346
I CHOPPED DOWN
THAT CHERRY TREE,
FATHER.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.248
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

00:47.281 --> 00:49.717
HENRY GOT THE LEAD
IN THE SCHOOL PLAY.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.419
WHOA. HOLD ON, NOW.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.221
CLAUDIA'S DOIN'
A MARTHA STEWART ACT,

00:53.254 --> 00:55.823
THAT LITTLE HAMBONE HAS GOT
THE LEAD IN THE PLAY,

00:55.856 --> 00:58.159
AND LILY'S
IN THE SCIENCE NUTS?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.593
DAD, THIS IS
THE NEW US,

00:59.627 --> 01:02.496
THANKS TO ME,
ME AND MY GREATNESS.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.764
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

01:03.797 --> 01:06.200
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW THAT
NEW SIGN THEY PUT UP
NEXT TO THE SCHOOL

01:06.234 --> 01:07.568
WITH ALL
THE STUPID SAYINGS?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.137
UH-HUH.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.448
Girl: GOD, THAT'S LAME.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.786
UH, YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S REALLY LAME.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.156
IT'S INCREDIBLY LAME.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.291
YEAH.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.126
SEE YA.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.414
HENRY!

01:53.447 --> 01:55.583
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HOLDING THE LADDER.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.251
I CANNOT TELL A LIE.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.220
I WAS NOT.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.362
UNBELIEVABLE!

02:08.396 --> 02:10.264
IT'S A PERFECT ANAGRAM.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.432
NOT QUITE.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.168
THIS WAS LEFT OVER.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.772
COOL.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.241
OUR BOY'S GROWING UP.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.610
YEAH. HE VANDALIZED
SCHOOL PROPERTY.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.944
DAD, HE REARRANGED
SCHOOL PROPERTY.

02:23.977 --> 02:28.182
THEN SISTER HELEN
GOT IN THIS BIG SNIT
ABOUT IT.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.818
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.320
COME ON.
IT'S VERY FUNNY.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.722
WELL, OBVIOUSLY HUMOR
IS SUBJECTIVE.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.823
NO, IT'S NOT.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.258
I MEAN, THERE'S SOME
STUFF THAT'S FUNNY
TO EVERYBODY,

02:37.291 --> 02:38.158
LIKE, UH...
CADDYSHACK.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.461
CADDYSHACK WAS NOT FUNNY.
WHAT?!

02:40.494 --> 02:44.598
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GRANT YOU
BILL MURRAY WITH THE GOPHER
WAS GREAT

02:44.632 --> 02:45.933
AND I KINDA LIKED
TED KNIGHT, BUT THAT--

02:45.966 --> 02:48.869
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
CADDY DAY AT THE POOL
AND THE BABY--

02:48.902 --> 02:49.770
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.772
MR. FINNERTY, YOUR SON
WILL BE IN DETENTION

02:51.805 --> 02:53.241
FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.308
WAIT A MINUTE!

02:54.342 --> 02:55.976
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
JIMMY'S THE ONE
WHO DID THAT.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.211
OH, I KNOW.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.580
I CANNOT TELL A LIE.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.014
JIMMY DID IT.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.317
SISTER HELEN, HAVE YOU
HEARD OF A LITTLE THING
CALLED FREEDOM OF SPEECH?

03:03.351 --> 03:06.820
MR. FINNERTY, I HARDLY
THINK JIMMY'S RIGHT
TO DEFACE MY SIGN

03:06.854 --> 03:08.656
WITH A CRACK
ABOUT CROSS-DRESSERS

03:08.689 --> 03:11.659
IS WHAT THE FRAMERS
OF THE CONSTITUTION
HAD IN MIND.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.526
OH, I SEE.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.595
SO FIRST IT'S
JIMMY'S LITTLE
SIGN JOKE,

03:14.628 --> 03:15.996
AND THEN,
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

03:16.029 --> 03:17.631
LILY CAN'T WRITE
A REPORT ON DARWIN.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.766
AND THEN ALL
OF A SUDDEN

03:18.799 --> 03:20.901
YOU'RE BURNING
COPIES OF
CATCHER IN THE RYE!

03:20.934 --> 03:21.835
AND THEN HENRY'S
NOT EVEN AUDITIONING

03:21.869 --> 03:23.804
FOR THE PART OF
GEORGE WASHINGTON
ANYMORE.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.374
NO, NO, NO, NO.
HE'S AUDITIONING TO PLAY
JOSEPH STALIN!

03:26.407 --> 03:28.509
I THINK YOU'RE BEING
RATHER ALARMIST.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.843
OH, AYE, AYE,
SISTER STALIN!

03:29.877 --> 03:31.345
YOUR SON VANDALIZED
PRIVATE PROPERTY!

03:31.379 --> 03:34.748
WHAT? I'M SORRY,
I CAN'T HEAR YOU,
SISTER STALIN.

03:34.782 --> 03:35.516
STOP CALLING ME THAT.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.917
OH, YES, SIR,
SISTER STALIN, SIR!

03:36.950 --> 03:38.919
STOP IT.
I SAID STOP IT!

03:38.952 --> 03:39.887
SISTER STALIN!

03:39.920 --> 03:41.289
MR. FINNERTY...

03:41.322 --> 03:43.291
YOU!

04:02.676 --> 04:03.811
HELLO, CLAUDIA.

04:03.844 --> 04:07.781
CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING NAMED
THE NEW COMMITTEE PRESIDENT.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.916
THANK YOU, CONNIE.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.784
IF YOU'D LIKE,
I COULD HELP YOU
RUN THE MEETING TONIGHT,

04:10.818 --> 04:14.588
CONSIDERING THAT I WAS
THE PRESIDENT UNTIL YESTERDAY.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.989
OH, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT NO.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.326
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
TO A SINGLE MEETING.

04:18.359 --> 04:22.730
THEN WON'T I GIVE
A NICE, FRESH PERSPECTIVE
TO TONIGHT'S MEETING?

04:22.763 --> 04:23.497
HAVE A SEAT.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.765
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT ME--

04:24.798 --> 04:26.700
UH-HUH.
SIT YOUR BUTT DOWN.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.969
DAD, I'M TELLIN' YOU--

04:29.002 --> 04:31.705
SISTER HELEN
WOULD NEVER CURSE.

04:31.739 --> 04:32.473
YOU MISHEARD.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.975
SHE MUST HAVE SAID,
"FORGET YOU."

04:35.008 --> 04:35.976
OH, COME ON, DAD.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.578
NOBODY SAYS,
"FORGET YOU."

04:37.611 --> 04:38.612
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.681
YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE
WATCHING SCARFACE ON TV.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.883
COME ON, COME ON.
I KNOW WHAT I HEARD,

04:42.916 --> 04:45.719
AND I WAS AS SHOCKED
AS YOU ARE.

04:46.354 --> 04:46.954
EXCUSE ME?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.656
GOOD DAY, MR. FINNERTY.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.391
W-W-W-WHAT DID YOU--
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

04:50.424 --> 04:51.359
I SAID GOOD DAY.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.761
NO! NO, NO.
SHE--SHE--YOU HEARD
THAT, RIGHT?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.664
YOU HEARD THAT NUN--
THAT NUN--SHE JUST--

04:56.697 --> 04:57.331
YOU HEARD HER.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.632
SHE--SHE JUST
CUSSED ME OUT!

04:58.666 --> 04:59.299
THE NUN JUST CUSSED--

04:59.333 --> 05:01.602
THAT NUN JUST
CUSSED ME OUT!

05:01.635 --> 05:04.438
SHE--
YOU HEARD HER, GOD!

05:04.472 --> 05:05.739
I BELIEVE YOU, SEAN.

05:05.773 --> 05:06.740
THANKS, EDDIE.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.510
HE ALSO BELIEVES
THE AZTECS INVENTED TELEVISION.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.545
FIRST OF ALL,
I PREFACED BY SAYING

05:11.579 --> 05:13.714
IT WAS EXTREMELY
PRIMITIVE TELEVISION.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.816
YOU NEVER LISTEN
TO THE PREFACES.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.719
YOU SHOULD JUST LEAVE
THAT POOR NUN ALONE.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.721
YOU BEEN TORTURING HER
FOR YEARS.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.656
WAIT. I'VE BEEN
TORTURING HER?
UH-UH!

05:22.690 --> 05:24.992
NO. SINCE DAY ONE,
SHE HAD IT OUT
FOR MY FAMILY.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.827
WELL, THAT'S YOUR
OPINION, MR. FINNERTY.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.830
AS USUAL, IT JUST HAPPENS
TO BE WRONG.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.434
WELL, I'M SURE I WOULD
SEE IT YOUR WAY,
MR. FINNERTY,

05:33.467 --> 05:34.602
IF I WERE INSANE.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.905
WE THOUGHT IT BEST
TO CURTAIL JIMMY'S
ALTAR BOY ACTIVITIES

05:37.938 --> 05:38.772
FOR THE MOMENT.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.941
COME ON.
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
GRAPE JUICE.

05:40.974 --> 05:41.942
NO, I DIDN'T.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.745
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S SAYING.
HE'S DRUNK.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.646
CUT HIM SOME SLACK.

05:45.679 --> 05:49.450
I'M A NUN, MR. FINNERTY.
I DON'T DO SLACK.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.283
SLACK?

05:50.317 --> 05:53.754
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET YOU
SOME COFFEE.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.123
WELL, MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T
BE ONTO YOUR CASE

05:56.156 --> 05:57.958
ALL THE TIME IF YOU
KEPT YOUR KIDS IN LINE.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.927
I'M NOT SAYING
WE'RE PERFECT,
ALL RIGHT?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.995
WE MAKE MISTAKES,
BUT SHE'S GOT
THIS ATTITUDE.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.797
SHE'S ALWAYS ACTING
HOLIER THAN THOU.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.900
SHE'S A NUN!
SHE HOLIER THAN THOU.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.902
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT ANYMORE.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.972
NOT AFTER SHE SAID
THE MAGIC WORD.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.140
IT WAS INCREDIBLE!

06:13.173 --> 06:14.775
I WISH YOU'D HAVE
HEARD IT, BABY.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.710
I MEAN,
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A LIST OF WORDS

06:16.744 --> 06:17.911
THAT NUNS CAN'T
SAY, RIGHT?

06:17.945 --> 06:18.879
I GUESS.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.113
AND THAT WORD
HAS TO BE IN
THE TOP 5, RIGHT?

06:20.147 --> 06:20.848
I WOULD IMAGINE.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.550
COME ON, BABY,
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.685
YOU DON'T EVEN
SEEM TO CARE.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.352
OH, MY GOD!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.286
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HANDS?

06:26.319 --> 06:29.523
I GOT STUCK DOING THE SETS
FOR HENRY'S PLAY.

06:29.557 --> 06:33.827
I HAD TO DYE
15 BEDSHEETS BLUE
TO MAKE THE DELAWARE RIVER.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.028
IT'S NOT FAIR.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.799
I ALWAYS GET STUCK
WITH THE CRAPPY JOBS.
ALWAYS.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.702
CLAUDIA!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.036
THE RECTORY LOT IS FULL!

06:43.070 --> 06:45.873
SEND ALL THESE CARS OVER
TO THE JACK IN THE BOX.

06:45.906 --> 06:50.878
CONNIE, I DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR THAT I GET
PARKING DUTY ALWAYS!

06:50.911 --> 06:53.981
WELL, IF YOU'D SHOW UP
FOR THE PARENT
MEETINGS...

06:54.014 --> 06:54.948
UGH! COME ON!

06:54.982 --> 06:57.785
THE MEETINGS ARE ALL
AT 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON!

06:57.818 --> 06:58.886
I WORK!

06:58.919 --> 07:00.053
I'M SORRY.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.924
OH, OSTRICH LEFT
A LITTLE BUSINESS
OVER BY THE BIKE RACK.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.760
I HAVE A JOB.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.863
I SHOULDN'T GET PENALIZED
JUST 'CAUSE I CAN'T MAKE IT
TO THEIR STUPID MEETINGS.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.065
I JUST WISH SOMEONE
HAD HEARD HER!

07:12.099 --> 07:14.167
OH, WOULD YOU
GET OFF THAT?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.335
I CAN'T. I'M JUST
SAYING, YOU KNOW,

07:15.368 --> 07:17.838
THAT IF SHE KNEW THAT I HAD
PROOF THAT SOMEONE HEARD HER,

07:17.871 --> 07:19.773
THEN I'D HAVE HER
OVER A BARREL.

07:19.807 --> 07:20.874
I COULD CHANGE THINGS.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.943
YOU KNOW, THINGS COULD GO GOOD
FOR OUR FAMILY FOR ONCE.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.144
I'LL BET YOU COULD.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.212
I DEFINITELY COULD.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.880
MMM, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

07:26.914 --> 07:27.581
YEAH!

07:27.615 --> 07:29.483
OH, NO, BABY, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.986
I CAN'T GET IT ON
WITH A SMURF.

07:33.921 --> 07:37.891
I'D DO A TELETUBBY
IN A HEARTBEAT, THOUGH.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.593
I ONCE HAD AN INTIMATE
ENCOUNTER

07:39.627 --> 07:42.596
WITH A WOMAN WHO WAS
COMPLETELY GREEN.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.764
WHY WAS SHE GREEN?

07:43.797 --> 07:44.798
I DON'T KNOW.

07:44.832 --> 07:45.899
YOU DIDN'T ASK?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.901
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

07:48.936 --> 07:49.870
NOW, I PROPOSE

07:49.903 --> 07:52.873
THAT ALL THE ASSIGNMENTS
FOR OUR PARENT DUTIES

07:52.906 --> 07:54.174
BE DISTRIBUTED
IN A RANDOM DRAWING.

07:54.207 --> 07:59.012
THAT WAY OLD CONNIE HERE
WILL HAVE JUST AS MUCH
A CHANCE AS I WILL

07:59.046 --> 08:00.013
OF SHOVELING POOP.

08:00.047 --> 08:03.884
WELL, CLAUDIA, WE'VE ALWAYS
USED SIGN-UP SHEETS.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.953
WHICH YOU HANDED OUT
AT THE MEETINGS,

08:05.986 --> 08:09.723
WHICH THE WORKING PARENTS
WERE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.958
RIGHT? ALL IN FAVOR,

08:10.991 --> 08:11.592
YEAH?

08:11.625 --> 08:14.127
AYE, AYE. GREAT.
NEXT ITEM.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.495
GREAT TO HAVE SOME MORE

08:15.529 --> 08:17.865
WORKING PARENTS HERE
TONIGHT, ISN'T IT, CONNIE?

08:17.898 --> 08:18.932
TERRIFIC.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.168
UH-HUH. I SEE THAT
ON THE 16th THERE'S
A FIELD TRIP

08:21.201 --> 08:23.070
TO THE BOTANICAL GARDEN,
WHICH ALL KIDS HATE,

08:23.103 --> 08:25.739
SO COME ON, LET'S SEND THEM
TO THE AQUARIUM, RIGHT?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.875
CLAUDIA, WE WENT
TO THE AQUARIUM BEFORE

08:27.908 --> 08:29.810
AND SOME OF THE ANIMAL
BEHAVIOR THERE

08:29.843 --> 08:31.979
IS INAPPROPRIATE
FOR CHILDREN.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.915
WHAT?

08:34.948 --> 08:35.649
THE MANTA RAYS WERE...

08:35.683 --> 08:37.751
GRINDING AT EACH OTHER.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.053
KIDS ARE NOT GETTING IDEAS
FROM MANTA RAYS, ALL RIGHT?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.789
OVERRULED.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.658
BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING,

08:44.692 --> 08:45.993
THEY WERE NOT HAVING SEX.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.027
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.930
BECAUSE THE FEMALE LAYS
AN EGG POUCH IN THE SAND.

08:49.963 --> 08:54.034
AT A LATER DATE, THE MALE
EMITS A CLOUD OF SPERM

08:54.067 --> 08:54.868
NEAR THE POUCH.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.205
THEY NEVER HAVE
ANY PHYSICAL CONTACT.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.575
IT'S ACTUALLY RATHER SAD.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.113
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOIN'?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.014
WHAT

09:07.047 --> 09:08.582
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT...

09:08.616 --> 09:11.619
MANLY FLUIDS
IN FRONT OF THE LADIES.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.253
OH, YEAH? WHAT,
IN THIS DAY AND AGE,

09:13.286 --> 09:16.289
WITH NUNS GOIN' AROUND
SWEARIN', WHO'S TO SAY?

09:16.323 --> 09:17.591
THEY WEREN'T SWEARIN'.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.793
OH, COME ON, DAD,
IF SHE DIDN'T SWEAR,

09:19.827 --> 09:20.794
HOW IS IT THAT MY WIFE,

09:20.828 --> 09:22.362
WHO HAS NEVER BEFORE
ATTENDED A PARENTS
MEETING,

09:22.395 --> 09:24.932
IS NOW PRESIDENT
OF THE COMMITTEE, HUH?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.199
YOU DID THAT?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.434
YES, I DID.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.902
ALL I HAD TO DO IS PROVE
THAT SISTER HELEN SAID
WHAT SHE SAID.

09:28.936 --> 09:35.575
A DIFFICULT TASK FOR MOST,
BUT THEN AGAIN, THEY'RE
NOT AS CREATIVE AS I AM.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.084
BEGIN YOUR CONFESSION,
MY CHILD.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.654
HELLO, FATHER,
'TIS I--AHEM--

09:46.687 --> 09:48.922
MONSIGNOR
REILLY.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.890
MONSIGNOR REILLY?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.125
THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

09:52.159 --> 09:53.226
DOIN' A LITTLE
PENANCE CHECK,

09:53.260 --> 09:57.097
MAKIN' SURE YOU'RE
NOT OVERDOIN' IT
ON THE HAIL MARYS,

09:57.130 --> 09:58.632
YOU SEE, HA HA.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.366
HA HA.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.133
YES. AHEM!

10:00.167 --> 10:03.370
SO THIS LAST CONFESSION,
THIS NUN,

10:03.403 --> 10:04.872
GET ME UP TO SPEED.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.340
WHAT WAS--WHAT WAS
HER DEAL?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.109
WHA--WAIT.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.010
DON'T OPEN--

10:10.043 --> 10:10.978
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.145
OK, SO I'M NOT
MONSIGNOR REILLY,

10:12.179 --> 10:15.115
BUT I--I WORK
FOR SISTER HELEN AND
SHE'S VERY FORGETFUL.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.016
WHAT DID SHE JUST SAY?

10:16.049 --> 10:18.819
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CONFESS OR GET OUT.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.654
WELL, I THINK WE CAN
AT LEAST AGREE THAT

10:20.688 --> 10:22.389
SHE ADMITTED
TO USING PROFANITY.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.623
I CAN'T ADMIT TO ANYTHING.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.326
WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS
CONFESSIONAL IS ABSOLUTELY
CONFIDENTIAL.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.394
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.163
IF SHE CONFESSED
TO MURDER, YOU'D
HAVE TO SPEAK UP.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.031
NO, I WOULDN'T.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.100
WELL, WHAT SHE DID
IS WORSE THAN MURDER.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.334
MURDER IS MUCH WORSE!

10:34.367 --> 10:36.069
WORSE THAN WHAT?
WHAT SHE DID.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.839
AHA, SEE?
YOU'RE ADMITTING
SHE ADMITTED IT.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.107
WHAT--GET OUT!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.141
BUT--

10:41.174 --> 10:42.142
GET OUT!

10:42.175 --> 10:43.243
ALL RIGHT.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.177
OUT!

10:44.211 --> 10:45.145
OK. OK.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.014
WHOO! THAT FELT GOOD!

10:47.047 --> 10:50.718
NO PENANCE.
TOTAL FORGIVENESS.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.120
YOU VIOLATED THE SANCTITY
OF THE CONFESSIONAL.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.122
THAT'S A MORTAL SIN.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.089
NO, IT'S NOT.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.057
DAD'S RIGHT.
THAT'S A MORTAL SIN.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.892
OH, COME ON, WHAT,
YOU'RE TAKIN' DAD'S
SIDE?

10:58.926 --> 11:01.228
I GOT NO PROBLEM WITH IT,
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.963
OK, LOOK, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.165
I WAS DESPERATE.
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO,

11:05.198 --> 11:07.367
BUT THEN, AS IF GOD
HIMSELF SPOKE,

11:07.400 --> 11:10.871
A RAY OF LIGHT
SHOWN THROUGH.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.316
OH, GOD. OHH.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.823
HELLO.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.425
YEAH, THIS IS HIM.

11:33.160 --> 11:33.927
WHAT?

11:33.961 --> 11:37.030
NAME THE PLACE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.155
Man: MR. FINNERTY?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.824
AAH!

12:04.191 --> 12:07.194
I CAN HELP YOU.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.129
COOL.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.133
YOU DON'T WANT KIDS
GOIN' OFF CAMPUS

12:13.166 --> 12:14.034
TO BUYS SNACKS, RIGHT?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.770
SO IF YOU ALLOW ME
TO PUT VENDING MACHINES

12:16.804 --> 12:18.171
IN THE HALLWAYS,
IN THE CAFETERIA,

12:18.205 --> 12:20.407
IN THE GYM,
YOUR PROBLEM IS SOLVED.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.511
AND THE PROFITS
WOULD BENEFIT ST. FINNIAN'S.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.347
WHAT?

12:27.848 --> 12:28.448
CLAUDIA.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.383
HEY! CHAIR
RECOGNIZES HIM,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.786
SO SHUT YOUR BITE HOLE.

12:34.955 --> 12:35.755
AHH.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.925
SO WHO WAS THIS GUY
IN THE SCHOOLYARD?

12:37.958 --> 12:38.758
AN ALLY, DAD.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.994
WHEN IT COMES
TO HATIN' SISTER HELEN,

12:41.028 --> 12:44.497
THE SHADOWS ARE FILLED
WITH FELLOW TRAVELERS.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.935
WHO ARE YOU?
SHOW YOURSELF.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.072
IT'S YOU.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.841
YES.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.009
OH, MY--YOU'RE, UM...

12:56.043 --> 12:57.177
DAVID KERSEY.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.345
KERSEY, RIGHT!

12:58.378 --> 13:00.147
THE, UM...YOU'RE...

13:00.180 --> 13:02.149
KERSEY,
THE SCIENCE TEACHER.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.450
YEAH, SCIENCE TEACHER!

13:03.483 --> 13:04.484
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.154
MR. FINNERTY,
I WAS THERE.

13:07.187 --> 13:07.855
YOU WERE?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.057
I HEARD IT
WHEN SISTER HELEN--

13:10.090 --> 13:13.493
SAID THE WORDY DIRT.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.594
EXCUSE ME?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.896
GOOD DAY, MR. FINNERTY.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.230
NO. WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY?

13:17.264 --> 13:18.031
I SAID GOOD DAY.

13:18.065 --> 13:23.003
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
DID--DID--DID--

13:23.470 --> 13:24.371
YES!

13:24.404 --> 13:25.338
I'VE BEEN BRISTLING

13:25.372 --> 13:28.341
UNDER THAT WOMAN'S
IRON FIST FOR
6 YEARS NOW.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.476
I CALL HER
SISTER STALIN.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.311
THAT'S WITTY.
THANK YOU.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.081
I'M ALWAYS THE LAST ONE
IN LINE TO GET EQUIPMENT.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.282
SHE'S USING MY CLASSROOM
FOR STORAGE,

13:35.315 --> 13:39.419
AND NOW--NOW SHE'S
THREATENING TO DISBAND
THE SCIENCENAUTS.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.587
THE SCIENCE NUTS?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.788
NOT NUTS, NAUTS!

13:41.821 --> 13:45.525
LIKE A SCIENCE CLUB,
BUT IT'S MUCH HIPPER
AND MORE DYNAMIC.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.228
SHE WANTS TO DISBAND
THE SCIENCENAUTS?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.497
IS THERE NOTHING
THIS WOMAN WILL STOP AT?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.632
COME ON. YOU GOTTA
HELP ME NAIL HER!

13:52.665 --> 13:54.334
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT,

13:54.367 --> 13:56.336
BUT TAKE THIS.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.170
A KEY?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.571
THIS IS THE KEY
TO THE FACULTY LOUNGE.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.975
IT'LL PROVE YOU HAVE
A FRIEND ON THE INSIDE.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.978
AH, BUT I NEED
SOMETHING FROM YOU FIRST.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.279
JOIN THE SCIENCENAUTS?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.214
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.581
HE THINKS THAT
IF YOU JOINED

14:08.615 --> 14:10.417
AND ENCOURAGED SOME
OF YOUR FRIENDS TO JOIN,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.252
IT WOULD GIVE IT
A WHOLE NEW ENERGY.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.420
HA. NO WAY! NO WAY.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.557
THE SCIENCENAUTS
ARE HOPELESS GEEKS.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.393
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

14:20.427 --> 14:21.594
SCIENCENAUTS PROJECT.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.864
IT'S A SOLAR-POWERED CLOCK.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.400
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.169
WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE CLOUDS TO PASS.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.305
OH. WELL,
I COULD TELL YOU
WHAT TIME IT IS.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.540
NO!
NO!
NO!

14:33.573 --> 14:35.308
FINE. FINE.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.410
IT'S 8:23!

14:37.444 --> 14:39.212
NO!
NO!
OH!

14:39.246 --> 14:41.081
AWW!

14:41.114 --> 14:42.549
I CAN'T JOIN
THE SCIENCENAUTS.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.517
THE CHESS CLUB
MOCKS THE SCIENCENAUTS.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.519
HEY, THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.655
YOU DO THIS, AND I'LL HAVE
SISTER HELEN IN THE PALM
OF MY HAND

14:48.688 --> 14:51.458
AND THEN I CAN GET STUFF
FOR YOU, TOO.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.426
LIKE WHAT?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.462
YOU TELL ME.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.297
WELL, HOLY TRINITY
AND ST. ANTHONY'S

14:57.330 --> 14:58.698
HAVE CASUAL FRIDAYS
TWICE A MONTH.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.069
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
THEIR STUPID UNIFORMS.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.404
IF YOU COULD
GET THAT FOR ME...

15:04.437 --> 15:05.572
I CAN...

15:05.605 --> 15:08.341
IF YOU PLAY SOME BALL.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.977
WELL, I HAVE TO DISAGREE

15:10.010 --> 15:11.078
WITH LILY'S
CHARACTERIZATION OF 'EM.

15:11.111 --> 15:14.447
YOU KNOW, I WAS A FOUNDING
MEMBER OF THE SCIENCENAUTS.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.983
HA. OH, YEAH.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.517
I REMEMBER.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.388
OK, SCIENCENAUTS,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.057
OUR ELECTRICITY BILL
WAS $300 LAST MONTH

15:24.091 --> 15:26.326
AND YOU HAVE YET TO GROW
A SINGLE TOMATO.

15:26.359 --> 15:30.330
YOU JUST GOTTA BE PATIENT,
SISTER, YOU KNOW?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.132
I THINK WE'RE
STARTIN' TO BUD.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.967
LOOK AT THAT.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.437
THOSE WERE SOME
GOOD TOMATOES, RIGHT?

15:37.470 --> 15:42.375
YEAH, THOSE WERE SOME
BAD-ASS TOMATOES.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.979
WELL, HOW COME I NEVER GOT
ANY OF THOSE TOMATOES?

15:46.013 --> 15:48.481
WOULD SOMEBODY
PLEASE STOP HIM?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.517
OH, I CANNOT TELL A LIE.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.087
I CHOPPED DOWN
THE CHERRY TREE, FATHER.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.357
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT GEORGE WASHINGTON

15:57.390 --> 15:59.392
DIDN'T HAVE A BAD
BRITISH ACCENT.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.360
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.562
YOU EVER MEET
GEORGE WASHINGTON?

16:02.595 --> 16:03.563
DID YOU?

16:03.596 --> 16:06.633
I GEORGE WASHINGTON.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.302
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

16:09.336 --> 16:10.270
GOD.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.306
SO YOU FORCED YOUR DAUGHTER
TO JOIN THIS CLUB.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.109
NO, I DIDN'T FORCE HER.
I BROKERED A DEAL,

16:16.143 --> 16:18.311
A DEAL IN WHICH
EVERYBODY WINS.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.648
WELL, EVERYBODY BUT ONE.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.151
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR YOU TODAY,
MR. FINNERTY.

16:24.184 --> 16:24.851
I'M VERY BUSY.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.719
I'LL MAKE THIS
SHORT AND SWEET.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.355
I GOT A WITNESS.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.456
MR. FINNERTY--

16:29.489 --> 16:31.758
HE'S FROM YOUR OWN
FACULTY.

16:33.193 --> 16:37.164
YOU'RE BLUFFING,
MR. FINNERTY, AND BADLY.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.231
OH, AM I?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.167
THEN HOW WOULD I HAVE
GOTTEN MY HANDS ON THIS?

16:40.200 --> 16:44.137
YES, YES, A KEY
TO YOUR FACULTY LOUNGE.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.673
THAT COULD BE
FOR ANYTHING.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.242
OH! WELL, SHALL WE
TRY IT OUT?

16:49.609 --> 16:50.243
COULD BE A COPY.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.780
IT SAYS,
"DO NOT DUPLICATE."

16:58.585 --> 17:01.521
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MR. FINNERTY?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.256
YEAH, I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.493
"WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MR. FINNERTY"?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.628
THAT'S GOOD.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.530
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:10.563 --> 17:15.335
JUST TRYING TO MEMORIZE
THAT LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.338
JUST NAME IT ALREADY.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.507
SO I GOT JIMMY
OFF DETENTION,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.442
I GOT HENRY THE LEAD
IN THE SCHOOL PLAY,

17:22.475 --> 17:24.444
I GOT LILY
HER CASUAL FRIDAYS,

17:24.477 --> 17:25.478
AND FOR MY
LOVELY WIFE,

17:25.512 --> 17:28.781
A SEAT ON THE BOARD,
WHICH NOW MEETS
CONVENIENTLY

17:28.815 --> 17:29.582
AROUND HER SCHEDULE.

17:29.616 --> 17:33.120
ALL FROM DRIVING A NUN
TO PROFANITY.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.487
YEP.

17:34.521 --> 17:35.788
BY BEING A JACKASS.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.590
YEAH! HEY,
I'M ALLOWED, YOU KNOW.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.327
I NEVER TOOK SOME KIND
OF ANTI-JACKASS OATH,

17:40.360 --> 17:43.496
WHICH SADLY,
FOR THE POOR SISTER,
SHE DID.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.500
HELLO, EDWIN.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.701
SISTER, COME ON IN.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.837
BUT TRY TO WATCH
THE LANGUAGE.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.506
THERE'S KIDS HERE.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.443
MR. FINNERTY, COULD WE
SPEAK FOR A MINUTE?

17:56.476 --> 17:58.778
ALONE.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.381
ALL RIGHT.
YOU GONNA BEHAVE?

18:05.618 --> 18:06.653
BAKE SALES EARN
A LOT OF MONEY,

18:06.686 --> 18:09.256
AND THEY'RE A HECK
OF A LOT OF FUN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.757
NOT EVEN A LITTLE.
REJECTED.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.761
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME,
SISTER HELEN,

18:14.794 --> 18:16.696
BUT, UH...
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IT.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.432
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
FROM YOU, MR. FINNERTY.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.500
YOU'VE GOT ME.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.235
THAT'S RIGHT, I DO.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.238
YES, AND I CAN'T GO ON
LIVING LIKE THIS
ANYMORE--

18:25.272 --> 18:27.740
THE FEAR OF EXPOSURE,
THE LIES.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.609
AWW, WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU
SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT

18:29.642 --> 18:30.877
BEFORE YOU SAID
WHAT YOU SAID.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.579
YOU'RE RIGHT,
MR. FINNERTY.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.613
CALL
MONSIGNOR REILLY.

18:33.646 --> 18:37.517
YOU'LL BE RID OF ME,
JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS
WANTED.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.619
HERE'S HIS NUMBER.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.723
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA CALL HIM,
DO YOU?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.658
OH, I WANT YOU
TO CALL HIM.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.560
WELL, GOOD,
'CAUSE I'M GONNA.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.561
YEAH.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.430
GOOD.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.401
WHY?

18:54.434 --> 18:55.502
BECAUSE I DID IT.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.937
I SAID SOMETHING
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.240
I'M NOT PERFECT.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.274
I'M JUST A PERSON.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.543
BUT I'VE DEDICATED
MY LIFE TO TRYING
TO MAINTAIN

19:03.576 --> 19:07.447
A HIGHER STANDARD
WHICH I FELL FAR
SHORT OF, SO...

19:07.480 --> 19:09.582
MAKE THE CALL.

19:14.387 --> 19:18.958
OH, GOD, WOMAN!
YOU'RE SUCKING ALL
THE FUN OUT OF THIS!

19:25.532 --> 19:28.901
WELL, I GUESS THERE IS
SOME GOOD IN YOU.

19:28.935 --> 19:29.802
AH, WHATEVER.

19:29.836 --> 19:34.707
BY THE WAY, MR. KERSEY
WANTS HIS KEY BACK.

19:34.741 --> 19:35.942
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.944
YOU KNEW IT WAS HIM?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.712
WELL, OF COURSE!

19:39.746 --> 19:42.615
I MEAN, IT WASN'T VERY
DIFFICULT TO FIGURE IT OUT.

19:42.649 --> 19:47.387
BRAD, LEFT HAND,
BERYLLIUM.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.590
B

19:50.623 --> 19:54.827
OK, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
TO BERYLLIUM THAT WAY,
BRAD.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.597
HA HA.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.731
HA-A-A-A.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.866
Mr. Kersey: OK, LILY.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.235
LEFT FOOT, MERCURY.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.870
WHERE'S MERCURY?

20:03.903 --> 20:06.406
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.342
OH!

20:11.844 --> 20:13.246
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.548
THE LAST TIME THEY HAD
A GIRL IN SCIENCENAUTS,

20:15.582 --> 20:17.350
THEY WERE TRYING
TO BUILD ONE,

20:17.384 --> 20:20.353
BUT I'VE SHOWN MR. KERSEY
THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.690
SO YOU HAD KERSEY
IN YOUR POCKET
THIS WHOLE TIME?

20:23.723 --> 20:24.891
MMM...YES.

20:24.924 --> 20:29.562
TH-TH-THIS WHOLE APOLOGY
THING WAS JUST A RUSE?

20:29.596 --> 20:30.630
MM-HMM.

20:30.663 --> 20:31.764
OH, GOD, NO.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.934
OH, NO, THIS IS
NOT HAPPENING!

20:38.338 --> 20:39.272
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

20:39.306 --> 20:43.776
JUST TRYING TO MEMORIZE
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

20:44.911 --> 20:45.878
HA HA HA.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.280
OH, AND, UH, BY THE WAY,

20:47.314 --> 20:51.618
JIMMY'S DETENTION,
CASUAL FRIDAY, EVERYTHING
GOES BACK THE WAY IT WAS.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.288
OH, SISTER HELEN,
I AM SO GLAD TO
HEAR YOU SAY THAT,

20:55.322 --> 20:56.423
BECAUSE THIS
PARENT COMMITTEE

20:56.456 --> 20:58.858
DESPERATELY NEEDS
MY LEADERSHIP.

20:58.891 --> 20:59.626
NO.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.729
BUT CLAUDIA'S RUINING
EVERYTHING!

21:02.762 --> 21:04.831
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.567
MRS. FINNERTY, CONTINUE.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.436
BUT--BUT...

21:10.370 --> 21:12.572
FINNERTY'S LARGE
AND IN CHARGE! WHOO!

21:12.605 --> 21:15.775
YES, WELL, I JUST HOPE
IT WAS WORTH ALL YOUR EFFORT.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.543
OH, IT WAS!

21:16.576 --> 21:18.010
THIS THING ISN'T OVER.
NO, NO, NO.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.312
NOT BY A LONG SHOT!

21:19.346 --> 21:20.680
HENRY'S ONLY
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.615
I CAN STILL
HAVE MORE KIDS--

21:22.649 --> 21:24.684
SHE JUST FLIPPED ME OFF!

21:24.717 --> 21:27.854
CLAUDIA! SISTER HELEN
JUST FLIPPED ME OFF!

21:27.887 --> 21:29.689
SHE GAVE ME THE FINGER!

21:29.722 --> 21:32.024
Sister Helen: I WAS
SCRATCHING MY NOSE!

21:32.058 --> 21:35.828
NOBODY SCRATCHES THEIR
NOSE WITH THAT FINGER!

21:38.498 --> 21:39.165
COME ON!

21:39.198 --> 21:40.433
I MEASURE LIVE
CRUSTY FALCONS.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.067
NOT QUITE.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.570
IVAN SLAMS YOUR CLAMS!

21:43.603 --> 21:45.872
NO, BABY. THAT DOESN'T
EVEN USE HALF
THE LETTERS.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.774
FEAST ON MY VILE CIRCUS.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.710
YOU, SIR, FACE
MY EVIL SMUT!

21:51.010 --> 21:55.114
VISUALIZE A SEMIERECT
CARNEY, FLOE.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.015
WHO'S FLOE?

21:56.048 --> 21:59.051
IT WAS EITHER FLOE OR OLEF.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.820
I'M GETTING COLD.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.123
I HAVE LAVA
IN MY SMURF CREASE.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.525
THAT'S GOOD.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.560
BRILLIANT!
