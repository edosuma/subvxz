WEBVTT

00:10.610 --> 00:14.780
12 is the magic number.

00:14.781 --> 00:17.942
12 is divine.

00:18.530 --> 00:25.495
12 is both the beginning
and the end of time.

00:43.543 --> 00:44.977
You must hurry.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.313
When it comes to building clocks, father,

00:46.314 --> 00:49.081
there is no such thing as hurry.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.083
Leave us, please.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.388
The nazis have made a breakthrough.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.490
Impossible.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.058
The prophesies are True.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.095
The end times are here.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.550
The scriptures say,
"There shall be upon this earth

01:24.551 --> 01:26.218
"a distress of nations.

01:26.219 --> 01:29.455
"the power of heaven shall be shaken.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.090
"Nation will rise against Nation,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.359
kingdom against kingdom."

01:32.360 --> 01:35.427
Luke 4:22. You know your apocalyptic verse.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.930
Claims of the end of
days are as old as time.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.432
Ever since the apostles wrote
those lines 2,000 years ago,

01:40.433 --> 01:43.269
every generation had thought it
applied to them and them alone,

01:43.270 --> 01:45.003
and every time, they've been wrong.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.973
Yes, but never before have the dead arisen.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.913
Make eye contact with no one.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.590
The nazis
appropriated this place a year ago.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.959
They began their experiments
almost immediately.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.495
Were it not for our unnamed "Friend,"

02:09.496 --> 02:11.664
We would never have known.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.542
It's only a child.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.976
Born of no womb.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.452
Run!

02:33.453 --> 02:34.687
Hey!

02:34.688 --> 02:37.923
Halt! Halt!

02:39.960 --> 02:42.027
Halt!

02:42.028 --> 02:43.529
Halt!

03:02.313 --> 03:04.331
The nazis cannot be stopped now.

03:04.441 --> 03:05.735
They will come for us.

03:06.196 --> 03:07.608
Then we must fight back.

03:07.653 --> 03:10.145
We are too weak to fight back.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.614
But we may not be in the future.

03:12.615 --> 03:14.016
As Rosicruicians,

03:14.017 --> 03:15.583
we know the most important
thing for us to do now

03:15.584 --> 03:16.786
is to preserve that thing

03:16.787 --> 03:19.722
that lies in the tunnels
below this cathedral.

03:25.563 --> 03:27.083
We can't do this.

03:27.430 --> 03:30.399
A hundred generations have kept it hidden.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.601
We're not worthy to make this decision.

03:32.602 --> 03:35.237
If we don't, and it falls into nazi hands,

03:35.238 --> 03:38.073
it will mean the end of
mankind as we know it.

03:50.787 --> 03:52.789
There is an SS convoy
two minutes behind me.

03:54.557 --> 03:57.192
If we leave now, we might still beat them.

04:00.029 --> 04:01.197
Praise god for you, brother.

04:09.139 --> 04:11.039
That's it.

04:19.315 --> 04:21.716
Godspeed.

04:29.292 --> 04:30.392
They're here!

04:30.393 --> 04:32.528
Barricade it!

04:56.786 --> 04:58.720
It is up to god now.

04:58.721 --> 05:02.724
Not even god Can help anymore.

05:02.725 --> 05:04.726
Only the 12 can.

05:13.268 --> 05:17.405
♪ So we'll start slow ♪

05:17.406 --> 05:19.440
Seriously, you gotta try this.

05:19.441 --> 05:21.274
No, seriously,
I don't I have to try it.

05:21.275 --> 05:22.409
You don't even know what
kind of meat that is.

05:22.410 --> 05:23.512
And I don't care...

05:23.513 --> 05:25.546
on account of its deliciousness.

05:25.547 --> 05:26.913
Well, careful 'cause you
got a little hoof there

05:26.914 --> 05:28.317
- in your teeth. 
- Mm? I like it.

05:28.318 --> 05:29.785
Yeah?

05:30.642 --> 05:31.421
It's your fault

05:31.422 --> 05:33.088
'cause you introduced
me to street food.

05:33.090 --> 05:35.480
Yeah, that was when we were
young and in New Delhi.

05:35.481 --> 05:36.492
Where, it turns out,

05:36.493 --> 05:38.458
they're not known for
their health inspectors,

05:38.459 --> 05:39.974
and you ate everything off the carts.

05:39.975 --> 05:42.463
- Well, that was before. 
- Before what?

05:42.464 --> 05:45.199
Before I had something to lose.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.501
Hmm.

05:49.438 --> 05:51.472
You're never gonna
lose me, Hank Galliston,

05:51.473 --> 05:52.867
no matter how hard you try.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.086
All right, then.

05:54.090 --> 05:56.211
Let's go back and get six
more with everything.

05:56.212 --> 05:58.413
Come on. We got shopping to do.

05:58.414 --> 06:00.848
What is it today, 
parts or pieces?

06:00.849 --> 06:02.417
We're hunting for treasure.

06:02.418 --> 06:04.452
I mean, look at this.

06:04.453 --> 06:07.822
Imagine what's it's seen, the
hands it's passed through.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.557
Any way to find out who?

06:09.558 --> 06:12.427
Not really. I mean,
things just wind up here.

06:12.428 --> 06:14.229
You know, found in someone's
attic after they die

06:14.230 --> 06:16.564
or picked up in a garage sale.

06:16.565 --> 06:19.400
Their stories lost to history...

06:19.401 --> 06:21.002
Really?

06:21.003 --> 06:22.837
Making fun of me now?

06:22.838 --> 06:24.505
No! I'm not making fun.

06:24.506 --> 06:26.842
I'm making fun with you,
'cause, like, we're a team.

06:26.843 --> 06:29.010
Oh, is that it?
Don't you have, like,

06:29.011 --> 06:30.526
a, you know, magazine to be putting out?

06:30.530 --> 06:32.173
I should be getting back.

06:32.190 --> 06:34.714
I have played hooky long enough.

06:35.517 --> 06:38.586
Well, I'm gonna be at the
shop later if you wanna...

06:38.587 --> 06:40.088
you know,

06:40.089 --> 06:42.123
play a little somethin' else.

06:42.124 --> 06:43.391
It's a deal.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.462
I love you.

06:47.463 --> 06:49.397
I love you,

06:49.398 --> 06:50.833
even with my hoof breath.

06:52.835 --> 06:54.368
See ya, honey!

07:26.835 --> 07:28.302
Hello!

07:28.303 --> 07:29.471
We're on deadline!

07:29.472 --> 07:31.839
Who has got a story to pitch?

07:31.840 --> 07:34.309
Well, we've got a ton of news
feeds coming out of Romania

07:34.310 --> 07:36.444
about a family of werewolves.

07:36.445 --> 07:38.412
Werewolves? Come on, guys.

07:38.413 --> 07:41.115
What do I tell every reporter
on their first day of work?

07:41.116 --> 07:42.451
Don't start with the headline.

07:42.452 --> 07:44.051
Start with the facts.

07:44.052 --> 07:45.452
Which is why we're starting
with these facts...

07:45.453 --> 07:46.889
That there are people with

07:46.890 --> 07:49.023
a really inappropriate
amount of body hair.

07:49.024 --> 07:50.258
Mm-hmm.

07:50.259 --> 07:51.958
They're also the symptoms
of hypertrichosis,

07:51.959 --> 07:53.128
a congenital condition

07:53.129 --> 07:55.463
that causes uncontrollable
hair growth.

07:55.464 --> 07:57.366
It's the same thing
that brought us...

07:57.367 --> 07:59.567
Julia Pastrana,

07:59.568 --> 08:01.269
the "Werewolf woman."

08:01.270 --> 08:02.404
Been doing this a long time,

08:02.405 --> 08:04.071
and one of the
things I've learned

08:04.072 --> 08:07.809
is that the first answer
might not be the right one.

08:07.810 --> 08:10.411
But it could be the answer
to selling more magazines.

08:10.412 --> 08:12.314
People dig a little
mystery, Hank...

08:12.315 --> 08:14.448
a tease, an intellectual
reach-around...

08:14.449 --> 08:18.119
Things like spontaneous
combustion in Budapest.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.488
Or... Or skunk apes in Arkansas.

08:20.489 --> 08:22.291
I swear, you put one of
these on the cover...

08:22.292 --> 08:23.791
No, you know what?

08:23.792 --> 08:26.794
I am not gonna pay for you to
go skunk aping in Arkansas.

08:26.795 --> 08:28.096
Well, it's really not
as dirty as it sounds.

08:28.097 --> 08:29.831
And the point is, if you send us,

08:29.832 --> 08:31.298
you get to chill at home
with Laila for the weekend.

08:31.299 --> 08:33.335
Yeah, and we'll stay in one
room to keep costs down.

08:33.336 --> 08:34.368
No, we won't.

08:34.369 --> 08:35.871
What would make
Laila and I happiest

08:35.871 --> 08:38.371
is knowing that our favorite
reporters are safe,

08:38.373 --> 08:40.875
typing in their laptops,
in Brooklyn.

08:40.876 --> 08:43.910
Right, because tothing dangerous
ever happens in Brooklyn.

08:43.912 --> 08:45.246
The answer's still "No."

08:45.247 --> 08:48.115
Okay, fine, but, you know, when The Post
scoops up this whole skunk ape story,

08:48.116 --> 08:51.185
- just remember who was there
at the beginning. - Okay.

09:00.752 --> 09:02.055
Hey there.

09:02.097 --> 09:05.066
Shh! There's somebody
in the shop.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.201
What are you talking about?

09:09.338 --> 09:11.239
Laila?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.341
- They're trying to get in.
- Hold on. Talk to me.

09:13.342 --> 09:15.277
Call the police.
Honey, call the police!

09:15.278 --> 09:17.133
Hey, Arron, call the
police. Don't ask.

09:17.134 --> 09:19.067
Just get 'em to Laila's shop now!

09:19.070 --> 09:20.888
Okay, listen, I'm on
my way. Okay?

09:20.888 --> 09:21.745
You hear me?

09:22.251 --> 09:23.352
They're breaking in.

09:23.353 --> 09:25.420
Laila, what's going on?

09:25.421 --> 09:27.788
I've gotta fight 'em. There's
nothing else I can do.

09:27.789 --> 09:29.559
No, no, do not fight them! Okay?
I'll be there in two minutes.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.692
Laila?

09:30.693 --> 09:32.327
Aah! Laila!

09:36.499 --> 09:37.799
Laila?

09:39.569 --> 09:40.702
Laila!

09:54.026 --> 09:59.043
Sync and correction by GeirDM
www.addic7ed.com

10:06.294 --> 10:08.462
How'd you get in?

10:08.463 --> 10:10.732
Call the police. Honey,
call the police! Aah!

10:13.137 --> 10:15.031
All right, Mr. Galliston,
we have your statement.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.342
When a D.I.C. gets assigned to
the case, you'll get a call.

10:17.343 --> 10:20.212
Wait, wait. You're telling me we're
still waiting on a detective?

10:20.213 --> 10:22.013
We're doing everything we can.

10:22.014 --> 10:23.346
You just asked me
seven generic questions

10:23.347 --> 10:25.048
and took pictures on an
8-year-old cell phone.

10:25.049 --> 10:26.185
That's everything that you can?

10:26.186 --> 10:28.219
- Sir. 
- I-I'm sorry,

10:28.220 --> 10:30.254
but it just doesn't add up.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.889
I mean, if they
wanted easy money,

10:31.890 --> 10:33.857
there's a liquor store
right down the street.

10:33.858 --> 10:36.161
Big money... There... There's
an art dealer next door.

10:36.162 --> 10:38.996
Laila repaired old timepieces,

10:38.997 --> 10:42.033
which, as far as I can tell,
none of them are missing.

10:42.034 --> 10:46.003
In fact, the only thing that is
missing right now is my wife!

11:02.654 --> 11:05.123
No. It's all right. It's okay.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.092
We're gonna find her, Hank.

11:14.066 --> 11:16.133
Laila would've taken the train
back from the Flea Market

11:16.134 --> 11:17.102
to the shop, right?

11:17.103 --> 11:20.004
Yeah. She... She hates taxis.

11:20.005 --> 11:21.706
She's always saying it's cheating.

11:21.707 --> 11:24.007
Okay, so it probably would've
been the "L" or the "G," right?

11:24.008 --> 11:25.809
You know, they've got
surveillance cameras

11:25.810 --> 11:26.945
at almost every station now.

11:26.946 --> 11:30.248
Maybe whoever did
this was following her.

11:32.546 --> 11:33.587
Hank?

11:33.588 --> 11:35.545
Sorry.

11:35.546 --> 11:38.081
Just, we keep asking "how."

11:38.082 --> 11:40.836
If we want answers,
we have to ask "Why."

11:40.837 --> 11:42.086
W-Why her?

11:42.087 --> 11:43.288
Why the shop?

11:43.289 --> 11:45.023
"Why" will drive
you crazy, Hank.

11:53.632 --> 11:57.135
She must've come home before
she went to the shop.

12:01.841 --> 12:03.642
Sorry to come by so
late, Mr. Galliston.

12:03.643 --> 12:06.311
We're here to discuss the
incident on Bedford Avenue.

12:06.312 --> 12:07.645
FBI?

12:07.646 --> 12:09.180
We would've called
first, but we...

12:09.181 --> 12:11.883
No, no, no. It... It's fine.
Please, come in.

12:13.953 --> 12:18.089
No, I grabbed these because
I figured the could help.

12:18.090 --> 12:21.159
I just felt like I had to...
Had to do something.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.794
Well, it looks like

12:22.795 --> 12:24.196
you guys were doing a
whole lot of "something."

12:24.197 --> 12:26.197
Oh, this is where you
tell us to back off,

12:26.198 --> 12:27.732
let you do your job?

12:27.733 --> 12:29.166
No, no, no. This is where
I say, "I get it."

12:29.167 --> 12:30.734
When you lose someone
that you love,

12:30.735 --> 12:32.004
the hardest thing
is to do nothing.

12:32.005 --> 12:34.839
May I?

12:36.075 --> 12:38.176
Police have any new leads?

12:38.177 --> 12:39.878
Not as many as we do.

12:39.879 --> 12:41.212
I don't understand.

12:41.213 --> 12:43.616
We don't know much about
your wife, Mr. Galliston,

12:43.617 --> 12:46.117
but we know quite a bit
about who might have her.

12:46.118 --> 12:48.353
You see, we've been
working on this case

12:48.354 --> 12:50.321
for a very, very long time.

12:53.192 --> 12:55.026
This was taken

12:55.027 --> 12:57.296
from the traffic camera across
the street from the shop.

12:57.297 --> 12:59.697
Is that him?

13:07.773 --> 13:10.074
Oh, God.

13:11.644 --> 13:13.678
Laila.

13:21.153 --> 13:22.787
Who is he?

13:22.788 --> 13:25.123
Name "White Vincent" 
mean anything to you?

13:25.124 --> 13:26.658
No.

13:26.659 --> 13:28.360
He started out as
French Foreign Legion,

13:28.361 --> 13:30.762
ended up the highest-end
mercenary in the world.

13:30.763 --> 13:32.629
He's on every no-fly
list that we've got.

13:32.630 --> 13:33.866
The fact that he's
operating on U.S. soil

13:33.867 --> 13:35.833
is obviously a problem.

13:35.834 --> 13:38.336
What would a guy like that
be doing taking my wife?

13:38.337 --> 13:40.905
Actually, that was gonna
be my question to you.

13:40.906 --> 13:42.072
W-What do you mean?

13:42.073 --> 13:43.240
Well, there's only so
much we can tell

13:43.241 --> 13:44.610
from credit card receipts,
travel records,

13:44.611 --> 13:46.711
- about a woman, and so I... 
- A woman?

13:46.712 --> 13:47.913
You... You're talking
about Laila?

13:47.914 --> 13:50.048
She's the victim here.

13:50.049 --> 13:51.350
Well, that's certainly
how it would appear,

13:51.351 --> 13:53.885
but part of my job is to
look beyond appearances.

13:53.886 --> 13:56.387
I believe you do the same
thing at your magazine.

13:56.388 --> 13:58.388
So we were wondering if you
had any other information

13:58.389 --> 14:00.259
that might help us conduct
our investigation.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.026
Investigating who?

14:02.027 --> 14:03.728
My wife is not a terrorist.

14:03.729 --> 14:05.029
She owns a clock shop.

14:05.030 --> 14:06.196
And yet she's been kidnapped

14:06.197 --> 14:07.864
by one of the world's
most dangerous men.

14:07.865 --> 14:09.034
You don't find that odd?

14:10.336 --> 14:12.737
You know, you had me
when you came in here

14:12.738 --> 14:14.273
with your "fed with a
heart of gold" thing.

14:14.274 --> 14:15.707
That was a nice touch.

14:15.708 --> 14:17.308
She means something to him.

14:17.309 --> 14:19.310
I need to know what
that something is.

14:19.311 --> 14:21.846
We can help each
other find Vincent.

14:21.847 --> 14:23.982
We want the same thing.

14:25.351 --> 14:29.620
Unless you have something
more for me,

14:29.621 --> 14:31.823
I gave the police
my full statement.

14:31.824 --> 14:34.192
You can get it from them.

14:37.262 --> 14:38.630
I think you know what to do

14:38.631 --> 14:40.898
should anything additional
occur to you.

14:42.935 --> 14:44.268
Hmm.

14:57.950 --> 14:59.650
Hank, are you okay?

14:59.651 --> 15:02.820
Laila Must've bought this today.

15:04.923 --> 15:06.357
What are you doing?

15:06.358 --> 15:08.726
Guy was looking for something.

15:08.727 --> 15:10.762
Typical movement.

15:10.763 --> 15:12.230
Bushings.

15:12.231 --> 15:15.299
Clicks. Gong wire.

15:15.300 --> 15:19.300
You're with somebody long
enough, you soak stuff up.

15:21.306 --> 15:23.941
Escapement.

15:23.942 --> 15:25.843
Regulator.

15:25.844 --> 15:28.279
Quartz.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.881
Quartz isn't right.

15:31.717 --> 15:33.718
Hey, what's that?

15:38.824 --> 15:39.957
A diamond.

15:39.958 --> 15:43.728
And suddenly, we have a motive.

15:43.729 --> 15:45.296
Pretty tiny motive.

15:48.901 --> 15:50.601
And a...

15:50.602 --> 15:52.003
flawed one at that.

15:55.774 --> 15:58.142
Um, Hank?

15:59.845 --> 16:01.245
If that's not a motive,

16:01.246 --> 16:03.815
then... maybe this is.

16:06.952 --> 16:08.786
What?

16:08.787 --> 16:11.889
And if I'm not mistaken,

16:11.890 --> 16:13.925
that right there is
a treasure map.

16:28.004 --> 16:30.459
I'm telling you, that is
definitely a treasure map.

16:30.494 --> 16:32.336
It's not a treasure map.
Treasure maps don't exist.

16:32.337 --> 16:34.706
They were invented
by Robert Louis Stevenson,

16:34.707 --> 16:37.809
and then the myth was cemented
by "B" Hollywood movies.

16:37.810 --> 16:40.011
Uh, "Goonies" was
not a "B" movie.

16:40.012 --> 16:41.113
Well, then what else
would it be then?

16:41.114 --> 16:43.815
Okay.

16:43.816 --> 16:46.150
I'm gonna say... near Eastern.

16:46.151 --> 16:48.186
Old. Mm-hmm.

16:48.187 --> 16:49.588
If we could read the
writing, which we can't,

16:49.589 --> 16:51.656
it would tell us what
this map leads to.

16:51.657 --> 16:53.758
Well, I think I know
where this is going.

16:53.759 --> 16:57.829
If you can't do something
yourself, find somebody who can.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.231
The priest.

17:07.239 --> 17:10.340
You have any idea what
you've got here?

17:10.342 --> 17:12.710
The language is...

17:12.711 --> 17:15.079
a dead strain of Demonic,

17:15.079 --> 17:17.748
reserved only for
the priestly elite.

17:17.749 --> 17:21.219
But it doesn't fit 'cause
that language died

17:21.220 --> 17:23.054
in the 2nd Century.

17:23.055 --> 17:24.321
2nd Century?

17:24.323 --> 17:26.824
We're looking at a map of
the Western hemisphere.

17:26.825 --> 17:28.227
They didn't know about
the Western hemisphere

17:28.228 --> 17:30.194
in the 2nd Century.

17:30.195 --> 17:33.231
Meaning, some wing of the Church
has secretly been using it

17:33.232 --> 17:35.633
for 2,000 years.

17:35.634 --> 17:38.903
We're rewriting history
books here, Hank.

17:38.904 --> 17:41.606
But it doesn't explain Vincent.

17:41.607 --> 17:44.275
I mean, why would a mercenary
like that want this?

17:44.276 --> 17:45.277
'Cause it's a treasure map?

17:45.278 --> 17:47.311
Doubt it.

17:47.312 --> 17:51.015
The Rosicruicians weren't
the materialist sort.

17:51.016 --> 17:52.316
Rosicruicians?

17:52.317 --> 17:56.287
A secret society of
Christian mystics.

17:56.288 --> 17:59.023
They're still in existence,
hidden throughout society,

17:59.024 --> 18:01.259
readying themselves
for the Apocalypse.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.828
Father, that spot on the map...

18:03.829 --> 18:06.597
if it's not treasure,
then what is it?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.700
"New Bartholomew."

18:09.701 --> 18:11.068
A city?

18:11.069 --> 18:13.137
A city? Not... Not with
these coordinates.

18:13.138 --> 18:14.772
This is in the Arctic Circle.

18:18.076 --> 18:19.243
Hello?

18:19.244 --> 18:21.312
She says you have the clock.

18:21.313 --> 18:24.148
Please, just tell me.
Is she okay?

18:24.149 --> 18:26.184
Do you know, Henry
David Galliston,

18:26.185 --> 18:27.852
that you lived before?

18:27.853 --> 18:30.621
You're just a shadow of the
past cast forward in time.

18:30.622 --> 18:32.723
Is she okay?

18:32.724 --> 18:35.560
Your name is no more "Henry"
than mine is... you know,

18:35.561 --> 18:37.260
whatever they're
calling me these days.

18:37.261 --> 18:39.131
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:39.132 --> 18:41.132
It's good that you don't, brother,

18:41.133 --> 18:45.036
because if you knew the real
truth, you'd lose your mind,

18:45.037 --> 18:47.238
as I've lost mine.

18:47.239 --> 18:49.207
Listen to me. Okay, uh...

18:49.208 --> 18:51.676
The, uh... I'll do you a solid.

18:51.677 --> 18:54.278
Okay, the FBI is onto
you in a big way.

18:54.279 --> 18:57.715
So why don't you just let her go?

18:57.716 --> 19:00.218
Okay? No... No...
No harm, no foul.

19:00.219 --> 19:02.920
Oh, there's plenty of harm here,

19:02.921 --> 19:04.655
plenty of foul.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.594
What are you doing?

19:09.595 --> 19:10.828
No, no, no!

19:10.829 --> 19:11.997
Don't hurt her!

19:11.998 --> 19:15.199
The clock comes to me on this day,

19:15.200 --> 19:18.453
or she dies...

19:18.500 --> 19:19.904
On this day.

19:21.106 --> 19:22.173
No!

19:22.174 --> 19:24.108
Yes! Yes!

19:24.109 --> 19:26.577
Yes. Just... please don't hurt her.

19:28.180 --> 19:31.315
The park, between Pine and 23rd.

19:31.316 --> 19:33.751
Bring the clock at 4:00.

19:33.752 --> 19:35.319
And, Hank,

19:35.320 --> 19:36.921
you've seen enough films

19:36.922 --> 19:39.258
to know not to get
the police involved.

19:44.663 --> 19:46.664
If I could still advise caution?

19:46.665 --> 19:50.167
Now what we have here is a
profound historical import.

19:50.168 --> 19:51.637
To yield it to a madman...

19:51.638 --> 19:53.671
We're talking about my wife here.

19:53.672 --> 19:55.306
This guy's a pro.

19:55.307 --> 19:57.575
We mess with him, she's dead.

19:57.576 --> 19:59.810
I've known you since grade school.

19:59.811 --> 20:01.213
I married the two of you.

20:01.214 --> 20:03.214
This is not easy for me to say.

20:03.215 --> 20:04.982
But if the guy's a pro,

20:04.983 --> 20:09.053
you think he's gonna let
someone who can I.D. him go?

20:09.054 --> 20:10.621
Then what?

20:10.622 --> 20:11.790
We've got the one thing

20:11.791 --> 20:13.791
motivating him to keep her alive.

20:13.792 --> 20:17.595
We stop him before he
gets it, she might live.

20:17.596 --> 20:21.098
He wants the clock, we
bait him with the clock,

20:21.099 --> 20:23.934
but we hold on to the diamond.

20:28.991 --> 20:30.009
What's he's asking?

20:30.044 --> 20:31.142
Cash. Lots of it.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.720
Vincent's got swimming
pools full of cash.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.635
Maybe he wants another one.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.352
Why does it always feel like
I'm playing poker with you,

20:37.353 --> 20:38.436
Mr. Galliston?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.131
It would be so much easier if
you just tell me the truth.

20:40.132 --> 20:41.622
I am telling you the truth.

20:41.623 --> 20:42.386
Of course.

20:42.387 --> 20:43.454
Tell you what.

20:43.455 --> 20:44.321
As long as your info gets us Vincent,

20:44.322 --> 20:46.024
I'm gonna pretend like I
actually believe you.

20:48.126 --> 20:49.627
This is your rendezvous spot,

20:49.628 --> 20:51.263
which we're pretty certain
he'll be nowhere near.

20:51.264 --> 20:53.664
Good choice... Half a dozen
30-story buildings

20:53.665 --> 20:55.132
with direct sight lines.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.599
A couple of hundred
windows per building,

20:56.600 --> 20:59.035
and suddenly he's in any
one of a thousand places,

20:59.036 --> 21:00.970
waiting to see if you've
engaged law enforcement.

21:00.971 --> 21:03.073
When he sees that you're
alone... And you will be...

21:03.074 --> 21:04.276
Your phone will ring,

21:04.277 --> 21:07.078
and he will give you the
real rendezvous spot.

21:07.079 --> 21:09.947
We will be sitting on that call,
we will locate him from it,

21:09.948 --> 21:11.582
and we will bring him down.

21:11.583 --> 21:14.552
My wife comes first. I
wanna be clear about that.

21:14.553 --> 21:16.187
I can't promise you that.

21:16.188 --> 21:19.123
I can promise that
we'll do our best.

21:19.124 --> 21:21.759
I can also promise you that
this will be your best

21:21.760 --> 21:25.129
and maybe only chance of
getting your wife back alive.

21:33.271 --> 21:34.972
I want you to take it.

21:34.973 --> 21:36.141
No, I couldn't.

21:36.142 --> 21:37.641
Keep it locked in
the parish safe.

21:37.642 --> 21:40.578
Okay? I want it a million
miles away from the drop.

21:40.579 --> 21:41.947
It's the only leverage we have.

21:44.082 --> 21:47.752
Anything hits the fan...
Anything... You call me.

21:47.753 --> 21:49.954
We're gonna get her back.

21:49.955 --> 21:52.289
All right?

22:15.412 --> 22:17.694
You don't have to scrub me.
I'm... I'm all alone.

22:17.948 --> 22:19.115
"Scrub" you?

22:19.116 --> 22:21.417
God bless you and your
Hollywood films.

22:21.418 --> 22:25.418
The monument 200 yards ahead
of you... Get there, please.

22:39.637 --> 22:41.838
Skype number. He's doing
it through the Internet

22:41.839 --> 22:43.674
so we can't track the cell's G.P.S.

22:43.675 --> 22:45.542
Smart but not genius.

22:45.543 --> 22:46.942
The Internet leaves a footprint.

22:46.943 --> 22:47.978
We go after the router.

22:47.979 --> 22:49.079
Exactly.

22:51.916 --> 22:53.817
158 Pine.

22:53.818 --> 22:56.086
We have a hit on the top floor.
I'm on my way.

22:56.087 --> 23:00.087
Blanket anything within
100 feet of that signal.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.234
- Yeah?
- Good.

23:11.235 --> 23:14.137
One more stop, and the game
of red rover will be over.

23:14.138 --> 23:16.139
Come around to the
other side of the park.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.609
There's a coffee shop
around the corner.

23:28.085 --> 23:30.754
That's right. Just like that.
Keep on coming.

23:30.755 --> 23:31.921
Sorry?

23:31.922 --> 23:34.591
Keep on walking.

23:35.826 --> 23:37.228
You mean like I-I am right now?

23:37.229 --> 23:39.996
Yes. Just like you're
walking right now. Hurry.

23:41.966 --> 23:43.933
He can't see me.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.668
Something's off.

24:01.819 --> 24:02.787
Clear.

24:02.788 --> 24:03.987
Clear!

24:27.945 --> 24:30.780
Where is she?!

24:30.781 --> 24:31.948
Where is she?

24:31.949 --> 24:33.950
He was broadcasting to
somewhere else.

24:35.085 --> 24:37.620
He wanted to distract us...

24:39.890 --> 24:42.725
Because what he
wanted wasn't here.

24:42.726 --> 24:43.727
He knew somehow.

24:50.568 --> 24:52.135
Mickle!

24:53.471 --> 24:54.671
No!

24:54.672 --> 24:57.640
Mickle?

24:57.641 --> 24:59.042
Hey.

25:03.914 --> 25:05.648
Help!

25:13.403 --> 25:15.840
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna
make it. You hear me?

25:24.854 --> 25:26.022
What are they saying?

25:26.023 --> 25:27.823
They're saying it's not good.

25:27.824 --> 25:29.758
Mr. Galliston!

25:29.759 --> 25:31.960
Unh-Unh. We are done.

25:31.961 --> 25:33.065
I told you it wasn't certain.

25:33.070 --> 25:34.866
You told me you could put a trace on him,

25:34.867 --> 25:36.601
and now he's in the wind.

25:36.602 --> 25:37.836
He... He got what he wanted.

25:37.837 --> 25:41.072
- And what exactly is that?
- Don't start with me.

25:41.073 --> 25:43.174
Poker time is done. We
checked your bank account.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.242
Financially, you are
a dust mite to him.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.712
This was never about money.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.679
You wanna arrest me? Arrest me.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.082
But what you should
be doing right now

25:50.083 --> 25:53.084
is looking for a killer... One
who, at this very moment,

25:53.085 --> 25:55.920
is probably putting a
bullet into my wife's head.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.637
Don't believe that.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.672
Don't believe what you just said.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.208
He doesn't need us
anymore, Rachel.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.977
He got what he wanted.
He doesn't need Laila.

26:19.978 --> 26:21.779
- Hank... 
- It's logic.

26:21.780 --> 26:24.649
A guy like that, he
eliminates loose ends.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.150
Well, then screw logic, Hank.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.551
Logic is the compass...

26:27.552 --> 26:28.553
That as of right now

26:28.554 --> 26:31.322
will get you exactly nowhere.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.257
He's right.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.860
Now it's all about believing.
You've just gotta believe.

26:37.295 --> 26:40.297
After all this, she wants
me to have faith.

26:40.298 --> 26:41.899
Yes.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.601
You've got two ways you can go.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.570
You can believe she's
dead and quit,

26:45.571 --> 26:48.639
or you can believe she's
alive and find her.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.609
Even if I have faith,

26:51.610 --> 26:52.911
it's not gonna
create any options,

26:52.912 --> 26:56.580
which we have absolutely
none right now.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.083
That's not true.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.619
Okay.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.619
Think about it.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.987
There's only one place left

27:03.988 --> 27:05.891
that we could possibly
find him and Laila...

27:05.892 --> 27:09.060
New Bartholomew,

27:09.061 --> 27:10.661
whatever the hell that is.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.602
I'm in.

27:18.603 --> 27:19.569
Arrange travel.

27:19.570 --> 27:20.704
With pleasure.

27:20.705 --> 27:21.973
For me and me only.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.307
- Whoa. Whoa. What?
- Wait.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.676
You are better served investigating

27:24.677 --> 27:26.143
who made the clock.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.080
Where that thing came from
may answer the "Why,"

27:29.081 --> 27:32.550
because If for whatever reason I
come back here without Laila,

27:32.551 --> 27:33.750
I'll need another lead

27:33.751 --> 27:35.187
and another lead
and another lead

27:35.188 --> 27:37.321
until we find her. Got it?

27:37.322 --> 27:39.156
Yeah.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.692
Oh, and everything happens
in this office...

27:41.693 --> 27:44.261
On the phones, online.

27:44.262 --> 27:46.330
No flights. Not even a text.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.599
I'm telling you, it's a
mistake not to bring us.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.303
It's a bigger mistake
to get you hurt.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.106
I've had enough collateral
damage on this one

27:54.107 --> 27:57.608
to last a lifetime.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.683
Flight gets you into
Whitefish, and then you've got

28:04.684 --> 28:06.684
a 200-Mile drive across
the tundra after that,

28:06.685 --> 28:08.118
where you can hire
a pontoon plane

28:08.119 --> 28:09.586
to fly you the rest of the way.

28:09.587 --> 28:11.223
If you leave now, you can
just make your flight.

28:11.224 --> 28:12.723
Thank you.

28:24.569 --> 28:25.736
Good luck.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.151
Huh. Figured I wasn't done with you.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.652
We're just finding it very curious

28:41.653 --> 28:43.889
why a man who's in the
throes of an abduction case

28:43.890 --> 28:45.656
is flying off to Canada.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.258
What's in Canada, Mr. Galliston?

28:47.259 --> 28:50.094
Bunch of ice, lots of beer,
reindeer. There's...

28:50.095 --> 28:51.561
Hey, quit being pigheaded!

28:51.562 --> 28:53.231
I'm with the FBI. I could
be a resource to you.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.266
I don't trust you, lady.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.234
Feeling's reciprocal.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.577
Tell me what you
see, Mr. Galliston.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.745
A Fed looking for glory,

29:07.746 --> 29:10.148
trying to bring down number
one on the Watch List.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.585
Maybe you see a
social counselor...

29:14.586 --> 29:16.920
An ex-social counselor that
would like nothing better

29:16.921 --> 29:18.890
than to be a social
counselor again.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.592
Maybe you see a widow.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.627
Russiyana 71 mean
anything to you?

29:23.628 --> 29:24.895
No.

29:24.896 --> 29:27.264
It was a flight that went
down outside of Moscow

29:27.265 --> 29:28.333
four years ago.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.168
All 270 people onboard died.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.304
They blamed it on
Chechen separatists.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.172
Guess who the bomb maker was.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.974
Vincent.

29:36.975 --> 29:39.276
My husband was on that flight.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.111
Condolences,

29:41.112 --> 29:42.813
and I mean that,

29:42.814 --> 29:44.216
but you're making a
massive assumption

29:44.217 --> 29:47.051
about you and I being
the same. We are not.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.153
My wife is not dead.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.855
Change of heart?

29:50.856 --> 29:52.021
Let's just say that

29:52.022 --> 29:53.859
the alternative is no
longer an option.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.161
Then you of all people
should know what it's like

29:57.162 --> 29:58.796
to have your heart ripped out

29:58.797 --> 30:00.198
and to listen to bureaucrats
tell you that

30:00.199 --> 30:03.033
they're trying... Really
trying... and all the while,

30:03.034 --> 30:06.570
that thing is out there
that did you injustice,

30:06.571 --> 30:08.272
and nothing is gonna happen

30:08.273 --> 30:10.107
unless you do something about it.

30:10.108 --> 30:11.276
You're going after Vincent.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.611
I know it, even if
I don't know how.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.246
He's lethal.

30:15.247 --> 30:18.249
I'm trained with a gun and I'm
licensed to travel with it.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.085
That alone makes me
a resource to you.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.853
If I refuse?

30:24.189 --> 30:27.258
Well, then you're just
gonna have to pretend

30:27.259 --> 30:30.928
that you don't see me
sitting across the aisle.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.264
Hey.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.766
Oh, right. Hey, come here. Check it out.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.268
Look at this.

30:38.837 --> 30:43.207
"Norbert Peter Steinke IV."

30:43.208 --> 30:44.975
"Uhrmacher"? What's "Uhrmacher"?

30:44.976 --> 30:46.911
"Clockmaker."

30:46.912 --> 30:48.177
So you got a guy's name?

30:48.178 --> 30:49.915
No, I got a guy.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.649
How many Norbert
Peter Steinke IV's

30:51.650 --> 30:53.118
you think there
are in this world?

30:53.119 --> 30:54.251
Exactly two.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.153
We got one in Switzerland
who's 9,

30:56.154 --> 30:59.757
and one in Bavaria who's 93.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.726
Guess which one's capable
of making a clock.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.762
So you got a phone number,
an e-mail? Come on!

31:04.763 --> 31:06.196
No, I got an address.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.798
The only way we get to this guy

31:07.799 --> 31:09.334
is if we do it the
old-fashioned way.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.902
Go knock on his door.

31:11.903 --> 31:14.171
No.

31:14.172 --> 31:18.072
You heard what he said. We stay
right here. There's no trip.

31:18.073 --> 31:20.474
That's adorable, but no.

31:23.978 --> 31:25.546
No.

31:25.547 --> 31:26.847
Taxi!

31:29.551 --> 31:30.718
J.F.K.

31:30.719 --> 31:32.720
He's gonna kill us.

31:59.347 --> 32:02.583
Clock goes round and
and round and round

32:02.584 --> 32:05.719
until one day...

32:05.720 --> 32:08.622
It doesn't.

32:15.430 --> 32:18.832
That day is tomorrow, dearie.

32:29.826 --> 32:30.991
Excuse me.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.326
Is that plane for hire?

32:32.327 --> 32:33.727
Yeah.

32:33.728 --> 32:35.830
Can I make it that far North?

32:35.831 --> 32:38.399
That's right on the circle.
Something special up there?

32:38.400 --> 32:40.335
Well, that's what
we aim to find out.

32:40.336 --> 32:41.969
Will you fly us up there?

32:41.970 --> 32:43.772
I'm bettin' you know the guy who
came through here yesterday,

32:43.773 --> 32:45.973
asking the exact same thing.

32:45.974 --> 32:47.708
Did he have an accent?

32:47.709 --> 32:49.845
That's him. Couldn't fly
him 'cause of the weather.

32:49.846 --> 32:52.847
Well, our friend... Did he
have a woman with him?

32:52.848 --> 32:54.015
Didn't see one.

32:54.016 --> 32:56.350
He coulda had one in the
four-by, I suppose.

32:56.351 --> 32:59.620
Impression I got, he was in
such a hurry, he couldn't wait.

32:59.621 --> 33:02.324
He was gonna drive up there if I couldn't
fly him, which, of course, is nuts.

33:02.325 --> 33:04.992
Take you a whole day, if the
tundra's even passable.

33:04.993 --> 33:06.393
Will you fly us?

33:06.394 --> 33:08.996
If your money's green,
my plane's got wings.

33:14.636 --> 33:16.670
Okay, hang a right up here.

33:31.419 --> 33:33.353
Hi. Are you Norbert
Peter Steinke IV?

33:33.354 --> 33:34.854
The one that made
clocks in the '30s?

33:34.855 --> 33:36.992
Wait, Wait, wait. Hey, we
came a long way to see you.

33:36.993 --> 33:38.192
I don't care.

33:38.193 --> 33:39.661
But we found one of your clocks.

33:39.662 --> 33:41.629
I've made plenty of clocks.

33:41.630 --> 33:43.898
I think this is a special one.

33:47.669 --> 33:50.070
Dear Lord.

33:56.678 --> 34:00.381
Are you sure these
are the coordinates?

34:00.382 --> 34:01.983
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

34:38.820 --> 34:41.021
What do you see?

34:41.022 --> 34:42.356
I don't know.

34:49.697 --> 34:53.697
I thought that clock
was lost to time,

34:54.636 --> 34:57.036
and yet you have
found one of them.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.641
You're a Rosicruician.

35:00.642 --> 35:04.642
These are matters you don't
want to be involved with.

35:06.114 --> 35:08.649
Trust me.

35:08.650 --> 35:11.218
We're not leaving until
you give us some answers.

35:11.219 --> 35:14.922
Has blood been spilled?

35:14.923 --> 35:17.224
Yeah.

35:17.225 --> 35:20.394
Then it is just as it was.

35:20.395 --> 35:23.797
They are looking for
the clocks again.

35:23.798 --> 35:26.667
Willing, again, to kill.

35:26.668 --> 35:29.303
Clocks? As in multiples?

35:29.304 --> 35:32.306
Talk to us. We know about
the map inside the clock.

35:32.307 --> 35:35.376
Why did you make it? What...
What is new Bartholomew?

35:35.377 --> 35:37.645
Is it a city?

35:37.646 --> 35:41.646
New Bartholomew isn't
a place, you fool.

35:50.325 --> 35:53.894
What would Vincent
think is out here?

35:53.895 --> 35:58.365
I think the only thing that
matters is that he's on his way.

35:58.366 --> 36:00.301
None of this makes any sense.

36:00.302 --> 36:04.672
According to him, it isn't
supposed to make any sense.

36:06.741 --> 36:09.243
He said I'd lose my mind.

36:29.030 --> 36:32.199
New Bartholomew is...

36:32.200 --> 36:33.834
Was...

36:33.835 --> 36:36.370
Was a man.

36:36.371 --> 36:39.206
You're telling me the map leads to a man?

36:39.207 --> 36:40.407
Who? Why?

36:40.408 --> 36:43.377
12 numbers on the clock.

36:43.378 --> 36:46.980
12 men to save the world.

36:46.981 --> 36:49.249
12 apostles.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.919
12 apostles? What are
you talking about?

36:50.920 --> 36:54.919
The men Christ entrusted with
the salvation of mankind.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.258
Yes, and that happened
2,000 years ago.

36:58.259 --> 36:59.393
No.

36:59.394 --> 37:03.197
It was in 1938.

37:34.996 --> 37:38.165
In 1938,

37:38.166 --> 37:42.002
Europe was in flames.

37:42.003 --> 37:46.707
The very future of the
world was in doubt.

37:46.708 --> 37:48.275
So the Church...

37:48.276 --> 37:52.679
We did something that
has never been done

37:52.680 --> 37:56.383
in 2,000 years.

37:56.384 --> 38:00.384
We appointed 12 new apostles...

38:02.023 --> 38:04.291
A new Luke, a new Peter,

38:04.292 --> 38:07.194
a new Bartholomew.

38:07.195 --> 38:10.731
And they were given a secret...

38:10.732 --> 38:14.234
One that not even the Pope knew.

38:14.235 --> 38:18.235
A secret that could bring
about the end of the world.

38:38.626 --> 38:42.626
Executed. All of them.

38:44.766 --> 38:47.134
And if they ended up up here,

38:47.135 --> 38:49.803
they were way, way off course.

38:49.804 --> 38:53.804
No, they ended up exactly
where they wanted to be.

38:55.176 --> 38:59.279
The Apostles are scattered to
the four corners of the globe

38:59.280 --> 39:03.280
to keep that secret as far away
from the Nazis as they could.

39:05.053 --> 39:09.053
One clock was made
for each apostle.

39:09.991 --> 39:13.991
I made the clock for
new Bartholomew.

39:15.263 --> 39:18.398
He was a holy man.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.335
He was a noble man.

39:21.336 --> 39:25.305
He was a Nazi officer.

39:39.153 --> 39:43.190
You said that he had a secret.
What... What was it?

39:43.191 --> 39:46.660
Only the 12 knew.

39:46.661 --> 39:50.661
It was something hidden
beneath the cathedral.

39:53.968 --> 39:57.137
But there were whispers

39:57.138 --> 40:00.674
that it was a secret the
Nazis could never know

40:00.675 --> 40:03.210
because the Nazis
had figured out

40:03.211 --> 40:05.746
the first steps to eternal life.

40:07.215 --> 40:08.782
They had a way

40:08.783 --> 40:12.783
to render God irrelevant.

40:27.135 --> 40:29.236
Do you know,
Henry David Galliston,

40:29.237 --> 40:32.339
that you lived before?

40:32.340 --> 40:36.243
That you're just a shadow of
the past cast forward in time?

40:36.244 --> 40:38.979
The Nazis' reign ended,

40:38.980 --> 40:42.215
but the experiments didn't.

40:42.216 --> 40:45.152
Neither did the
search for those clocks.

40:45.153 --> 40:47.955
You must find these clocks,

40:47.956 --> 40:50.223
and you must do this

40:50.224 --> 40:52.626
before the enemy does,

40:52.627 --> 40:56.627
because if those
clocks resurface

40:57.031 --> 41:00.033
and blood has been spilled,

41:00.034 --> 41:03.770
then a storm is coming.

41:03.771 --> 41:07.771
It will pit Science
against Religion,

41:07.942 --> 41:10.243
country against country.

41:10.244 --> 41:12.879
The whole world will be drawn up

41:12.880 --> 41:14.681
into this storm.

41:14.682 --> 41:16.683
It will be unholy

41:16.684 --> 41:20.721
and like the world has
never, ever seen before.

41:21.856 --> 41:25.856
And that storm is called...

41:27.629 --> 41:29.664
Zero Hour.
