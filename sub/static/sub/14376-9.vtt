Captioning made possible by
Turner entertainment group
and U.S. department of education

00:47.250 --> 00:51.216
Excellent! This subject
is perfectly preserved.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.400
Where is the next experiment,
computer?

00:53.433 --> 00:55.433
Computer:
In quadrant 4, Dexter.

00:55.466 --> 00:57.133
Dexter: Thank you.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.383
Things have been going
very smoothly today,
huh, computer?

01:00.416 --> 01:04.150
Computer: Yes, Dexter.
All systems are operating

01:04.183 --> 01:05.483
at optimum efficiency.

01:06.016 --> 01:08.483
Optimum efficiency.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.283
[Brakes squeal]

01:10.316 --> 01:13.300
We have never operated
at optimum efficiency.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.083
Computer,
initiate standard scan

01:16.116 --> 01:18.050
for Dee Dee-like
life forms.

01:18.083 --> 01:22.416
I can find no indication
that your sister is
in the laboratory, Dexter.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.166
This does not make
any sense.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.166
Why isn't
she bothering me?

01:30.033 --> 01:34.183
Ooh! What a wonderful new Dolly
I found!

01:34.216 --> 01:36.466
I'll name you Dexter,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.066
and you will play
the ugly beast

01:40.100 --> 01:42.300
who can be changed
into a prince

01:42.333 --> 01:45.300
by the beautiful darbie
and her magic kiss.

01:45.333 --> 01:49.316
Dexter is very shy
because he is so ugly,

01:49.350 --> 01:52.000
but darbie thinks
Dexter is cute,

01:52.033 --> 01:55.400
so they got married...
Dexter...So cute...

01:55.433 --> 01:57.283
Dexter...dexter...dexter...

01:57.316 --> 02:01.150
She is plotting
something against me.

02:01.183 --> 02:05.066
Lucky I brought
my handy-dandy portolab.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.083
Hmm...

02:07.116 --> 02:09.016
Aha!

02:09.050 --> 02:14.083
My shrink-ray is
the perfect machine
for the job.

02:14.383 --> 02:16.483
Computer:
The shrink-ray
has been known

02:17.016 --> 02:19.000
to make the subject's
imagination run wild.

02:19.033 --> 02:21.450
The loss of size
causes a loss
of perspective.

02:21.483 --> 02:24.300
You may lose touch
with reality.
It is advised--

02:24.333 --> 02:27.066
blah, blah, blah.
I must shrink down

02:27.100 --> 02:29.066
so I can sneak
under Dee Dee's door

02:29.100 --> 02:31.200
and discover what
she is plotting.

02:31.233 --> 02:34.483
All right, Dexter.
You have one hour

02:35.016 --> 02:36.133
till
miniaturization ends

02:36.166 --> 02:39.150
and you must exit
from Dee Dee's room.

02:41.366 --> 02:45.433
Can't make anything out
from this angle.

02:45.466 --> 02:49.133
Perhaps if I were
to climb to the top

02:49.166 --> 02:51.216
of that tall
skyscraper...

02:51.250 --> 02:53.283
No! Not a tall building!

02:53.316 --> 02:56.200
Just a pile
of building blocks.

02:56.233 --> 02:59.033
Must stay focused.

03:04.466 --> 03:08.100
Dexter: Whoa!

03:09.016 --> 03:10.016
Dexter!

03:10.050 --> 03:13.083
All right, kid,
reveal your evil scheme,

03:13.116 --> 03:16.033
or I shall have to
force it out of you.

03:16.066 --> 03:19.016
Did you come over
to play dolls with me?

03:19.050 --> 03:21.200
Dolls? Dolls?
What are you talking about?

03:21.233 --> 03:25.000
Dexter, meet darbie,
Ben, and Dexter.

03:25.033 --> 03:27.083
Dexter?

03:27.116 --> 03:29.083
Focus! Focus!

03:29.116 --> 03:33.233
You mean all you
have been doing
is playing dolls?

03:33.266 --> 03:35.366
Of course, silly.
What else?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.183
And now we begin

03:37.216 --> 03:39.133
another
dramatic episode

03:39.166 --> 03:41.150
of<i>dollhouse drama.</i>

03:41.183 --> 03:42.383
The role of Dexter--

03:42.416 --> 03:45.033
Dee Dee,
I am far too busy.

03:45.066 --> 03:48.050
The role of Dexter
will be played by Dexter!

03:48.083 --> 03:49.483
As this episode begins,

03:50.016 --> 03:52.366
Dexter is happily
eating his breakfast.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.333
Eat your breakfast,
Dexter!

03:55.366 --> 03:59.133
My breakfast is
a nonremovable sticker.

03:59.166 --> 04:02.350
Although I am kind
of hungry.

04:02.383 --> 04:06.400
Dexter is joined
by his beautiful wife darbie.

04:06.433 --> 04:09.166
Dexter. Dexter.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.383
Darbie: Dexter,

04:10.416 --> 04:15.483
aren't you going to
kiss your blushing
bride good morning?

04:16.016 --> 04:16.483
Ok.

04:17.016 --> 04:19.000
Dee Dee: Oh, dear.
Look at the time.

04:19.033 --> 04:22.300
You must hurry, or you'll
be late to the lab.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.333
Mustn't be late!

04:23.366 --> 04:26.150
But Dexter has forgotten
his briefcase.

04:26.183 --> 04:30.233
Oh, honey,
I forgot my--

04:31.033 --> 04:33.366
Dee Dee: Dexter is shocked
to find his wife

04:33.400 --> 04:36.033
in the arms
of his best friend Ben.

04:36.066 --> 04:39.433
Unhand my wife,
you rat!

04:41.016 --> 04:45.100
Wow! What a great episode!

04:47.050 --> 04:48.333
Uh-oh!

04:48.366 --> 04:53.033
Darbie, how could you
do this to me?

04:53.066 --> 04:55.183
Is there some reason,

04:55.216 --> 04:57.233
some explanation?

04:57.266 --> 05:00.066
Your silence
says it all.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.166
Good-bye, darbie!

05:02.200 --> 05:03.416
[Dee Dee crying]

05:03.450 --> 05:06.200
They were
my favorite couple.

05:06.233 --> 05:08.350
Start, darn it!
Start!

05:08.383 --> 05:12.283
Dee Dee: Vroom!
Vroom! Brrrr!

05:12.316 --> 05:16.433
How could I have been
so blind, so stupid,

05:16.466 --> 05:20.100
so out of touch
with reality?

05:20.133 --> 05:23.466
Vroom! Vroom!

05:24.000 --> 05:26.166
Dexter drives
to lookout point

05:26.200 --> 05:29.000
and tries
to figure things out.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.316
Ah, lookout point.

05:31.350 --> 05:35.350
The view from up here
always relaxes me.

05:35.383 --> 05:39.483
[Ghostly voice]
Dexter!

05:40.016 --> 05:42.116
Uh, who are you?

05:42.150 --> 05:46.283
It's the ghost
of your first love.

05:46.316 --> 05:50.166
You must
forgive darbie

05:50.200 --> 05:56.066
or risk losing her
like you did me.

05:56.100 --> 06:01.183
I will. I will.
I promise I will.

06:01.216 --> 06:03.266
I must hurry home!

06:03.300 --> 06:07.000
Vroom! Vroom!

06:07.033 --> 06:08.350
Screeeech!

06:10.283 --> 06:16.000
Dee Dee: Darbie is in the arms
of Dexter's evil twin brother.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.483
Oh! Dexter,
I didn't know.

06:19.016 --> 06:21.233
I thought
it was you. I--

06:21.266 --> 06:23.150
I don't blame you,
darbie.

06:23.183 --> 06:27.450
This dirt-bag's been
plaguing me my whole life.

06:29.333 --> 06:33.066
Dee Dee: Dexter has broken
his brother into pieces.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.216
Nothing will ever
tear us apart again.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.216
Dexter! Look what
you've done!

06:43.250 --> 06:45.083
I'm telling mom!

06:45.116 --> 06:46.283
[Door slams]

06:46.316 --> 06:48.166
What have I done?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.466
No, darbie!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.216
I cannot let it
end this way.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.233
And then you know
what he did?

06:55.266 --> 06:57.450
Oh, all right,
all right, dear.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.450
Dexter!

06:58.483 --> 07:02.116
Dexter, what have
I told you about--

07:02.150 --> 07:05.016
shh!

07:05.050 --> 07:10.083
It's ok, my sweet.
Go back to sleep.

07:10.116 --> 07:13.066
You need your rest.

07:24.416 --> 07:26.183
The justice friends--

07:26.216 --> 07:28.150
3 of earth's
mightiest heroes

07:28.183 --> 07:32.116
joining forces
under one roof

07:32.150 --> 07:36.183
to face the challenge
of everyday life.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.200
Starring major glory...

07:44.233 --> 07:46.133
Valhallen...

07:46.166 --> 07:49.300
And the infragible krunk

07:49.333 --> 07:51.150
in...

08:04.316 --> 08:07.350
Rarggh!

08:08.283 --> 08:10.116
So, it's battle
you want, is it?

08:10.150 --> 08:13.383
Then the justice friends
will be happy to oblige you,

08:13.416 --> 08:14.333
comrade red.

08:14.366 --> 08:16.150
Ah, major glory,
it is time

08:16.183 --> 08:19.266
my most powerful comrades
and I are showing you

08:19.300 --> 08:22.316
who will be big boss
of entire world.

08:22.350 --> 08:24.433
First, we will
be crushing you.

08:24.466 --> 08:28.350
Then we shall be ruling
all that we are seeing.

08:28.383 --> 08:36.350
Now say hello to your
old friend living bullet.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.350
Well, well,
living bullet,
world's fastest man.

08:39.383 --> 08:41.066
Long time no see.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.100
Good to see you again,
major glory. Thanks
for showing up.

08:44.133 --> 08:47.083
Hey, anything for my
old college roomie.

08:47.116 --> 08:48.433
So, how are
the wife and kids?

08:48.466 --> 08:52.083
My work keeps me away a lot.
Here's some photos.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.033
Back to the fray,
as they say.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.416
Valhallen,
I'll handle
comrade red.

08:55.450 --> 08:58.183
Major glory:
You subdue that
large female.

08:58.216 --> 09:00.316
Valhallen:
Righteous.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.083
Krunk get
sucker punched.

09:04.116 --> 09:06.316
No one
sucker punch krunk!

09:06.350 --> 09:09.000
Krunk--huh?

09:19.266 --> 09:23.216
Huh? Shiny head,
who pretty lady?

09:23.383 --> 09:25.450
Never seen her before.
Ask major glory.

09:25.483 --> 09:28.083
He's a bit
of a nosy Nancy.

09:28.116 --> 09:29.450
Krunk ask flag man.

09:29.483 --> 09:31.250
Flag man.

09:31.283 --> 09:33.233
Oh, hi, krunk.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.233
What name of lady?

09:35.266 --> 09:38.433
Any special reason
you want to know?

09:38.466 --> 09:40.100
Well, uh...

09:40.133 --> 09:44.166
Aw, does little krunky-wunky
have a little crushy-wushy?

09:44.200 --> 09:46.216
Oh, come on.
Cut it out.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.366
Well, in the name
of good old American romance,

09:49.400 --> 09:51.366
I suppose
I could ask around.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.416
Now, I am going to
ask you a simple question.

09:55.450 --> 10:02.316
My large friend has his
subintelligent bloodshot eyes
set on that large female.

10:02.350 --> 10:04.383
What is her name?

10:04.416 --> 10:05.400
Talk!

10:05.433 --> 10:09.150
My comrades and I
call her she thing.

10:09.183 --> 10:10.150
She thing?

10:10.183 --> 10:13.366
She beautiful.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.116
Krunk in love.

10:15.150 --> 10:18.033
Good luck,
my love-struck friend.

10:18.066 --> 10:22.166
Krunk must get
to know she thing.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.433
Rairr!

10:23.466 --> 10:26.283
Hello there.
My name krunk.

10:26.316 --> 10:31.400
Me couldn't
help notice
you purple, too.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.383
She thing don't
notice krunk.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.033
Taketh my advice,
infragible one.

10:37.066 --> 10:39.083
Babes love flowers.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.416
Flowers?

10:40.450 --> 10:42.416
Errarr!

10:42.450 --> 10:44.066
Oh, uh, pardon me.

10:44.100 --> 10:48.416
Krunk bring she thing
beautiful bouquet.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.266
She thing play hard to get.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.316
Fraggin' flowers!

10:56.233 --> 10:58.100
Valhallen, look!
Over there!

10:58.133 --> 11:03.150
Isn't that cute?
He's bringing her candy.

11:03.183 --> 11:04.250
Aw!

11:04.283 --> 11:07.266
Maybe krunk
should defend
she thing's honor.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.466
Valhallen: Yo, krunkage,
wilt thou lend a hand?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.400
Yellow-hair
bother you?

11:12.433 --> 11:14.100
What?

11:14.133 --> 11:15.383
Allow krunk.

11:15.416 --> 11:16.283
Huh?

11:16.316 --> 11:19.016
Krunk say poem
for lady.

11:19.050 --> 11:23.166
Uh...krunk--roses,
um...clouds...

11:23.200 --> 11:24.400
Uh...

11:24.433 --> 11:26.416
The end.

11:30.433 --> 11:34.433
She thing like to
get to know krunk better.

11:34.466 --> 11:36.016
Ok.

11:36.050 --> 11:39.100
Ha ha ha!
You funny.

11:45.233 --> 11:48.283
[Screaming]

11:57.266 --> 12:01.283
Krunk love way she thing
pound krunk's teammate.

12:01.316 --> 12:06.116
She thing love way
krunk pummels
she thing's teammate.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.350
Aah!

12:07.383 --> 12:12.383
Krunk love way
she thing's eyes bulge
when she thing screams.

12:12.416 --> 12:17.033
She thing love the way
krunk lift heavy things.

12:17.066 --> 12:19.083
Krunk want always
to be with she thing.

12:19.116 --> 12:22.116
She thing want always
to be with krunk.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.233
Always?
Always!

12:24.266 --> 12:25.233
No.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.166
Yes!

12:26.200 --> 12:29.150
<i>Do svedania,</i>
comrade.

12:30.133 --> 12:33.283
Aah!

12:33.316 --> 12:36.050
What wrong,
honey bunny?

12:36.083 --> 12:40.000
Oh, krunk. See what
stupid fighting do?

12:40.033 --> 12:43.166
Now she thing
nail broken!

12:43.200 --> 12:44.100
Which one?

12:44.133 --> 12:47.300
Now she thing
look hideous!

12:47.333 --> 12:50.433
No one make krunk's
girlfriend look hideous.

12:50.466 --> 12:54.416
Aaaaahh!

12:54.450 --> 12:59.050
Krunk will smash
everyone!

13:02.233 --> 13:04.266
I get the feeling
he's upset.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.400
This doth stink
greatly.

13:06.433 --> 13:07.466
Well done, krunk.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.133
You know,
for a moment there,

13:09.166 --> 13:11.200
I thought they actually
stood a chance.

13:11.233 --> 13:13.383
Now we can
safely turn it over

13:13.416 --> 13:15.133
to the proper
authorities.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.350
Krunk say good-bye
to she thing?

13:17.383 --> 13:20.400
Well, I suppose.
