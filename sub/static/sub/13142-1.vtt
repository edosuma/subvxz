01:36.500 --> 01:40.795
I heard you interfering little bastards
rummage around my yard.

01:40.878 --> 01:44.631
I'll thank you for keeping
the owls off of my cats.

02:13.864 --> 02:16.033
You sleep OK?

02:17.993 --> 02:20.328
Sorta.

02:26.251 --> 02:28.377
I, uh...

02:28.459 --> 02:31.338
(man) God, Jean,
I don't know what happened.

02:31.421 --> 02:34.423
It's like a red mist or...

02:35.589 --> 02:39.010
Something comes over me and I...

02:40.720 --> 02:44.682
But I feel like you backed me up
in a corner and I...

02:45.683 --> 02:47.768
You do that, and uh...

02:48.726 --> 02:50.519
I hate it when I'm like that.

03:04.239 --> 03:05.866
I'm sorry.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.454
Can you forgive me?

03:21.420 --> 03:23.339
What?!

03:28.176 --> 03:29.886
Fuck!

03:36.141 --> 03:38.435
(girl) You promised...

03:38.517 --> 03:41.270
if it happened again...

03:41.313 --> 03:43.230
You promised.

03:44.147 --> 03:48.151
(woman) OK, this is last week
and up to yesterday.

03:48.193 --> 03:49.569
- All right?
- OK.

03:49.651 --> 03:52.739
- I stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- Kitty, I can't...

03:52.821 --> 03:55.073
- You can. Listen...
- Here, just take it.

03:55.114 --> 03:58.451
I don't wanna see you coming around here
anymore looking like this.

04:00.201 --> 04:03.623
You take care.
Take care of that girl. Get going. OK.

04:03.705 --> 04:06.332
(woman) We have a reciprocity
agreement with Kansas.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.458
If you can stay in this shelter for a week.

04:08.542 --> 04:11.085
- I could find you a place in Wichita.
- No.

04:11.169 --> 04:14.922
Every man in town who beats a woman
knows where this shelter is.

04:15.006 --> 04:16.757
Do you have someone you can stay with?

04:16.839 --> 04:19.841
(man) I don't think you really understand
just how worried I am.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.805
I don't know.
Maybe they went shopping.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.639
I wish someone in this goddamn place
would just...

04:25.722 --> 04:28.434
would just give me the truth.

04:30.686 --> 04:33.438
Then we could find Jean
pretty damn quick.

04:38.401 --> 04:41.112
(girl) Tribune, Kansas.
Do you wanna go there?

04:41.153 --> 04:44.698
(Jean) Sure. Maybe. I mean,
we can go anywhere we want.

04:44.782 --> 04:47.659
How about Loving, New Mexico?

04:49.703 --> 04:52.162
- I like that.
- Me too.

04:53.663 --> 04:55.915
Topeka.

04:56.458 --> 04:57.876
Santa Cruz.

04:57.958 --> 05:01.253
Oh, my gosh.
There's a Butt, Montana.

05:01.336 --> 05:04.214
- It's pronounced "Bute."
- (car engine rattles)

05:04.254 --> 05:06.589
- Mom?
- Oh, no. No!

05:15.222 --> 05:17.013
(motorcycle approaches)

05:21.812 --> 05:23.854
Hey!

05:25.105 --> 05:29.733
She's not going anywhere.
There's a rod sticking through the block.

05:29.776 --> 05:31.985
I'm heading to Sioux Falls.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.654
Yeah.

05:36.323 --> 05:38.617
Just take what you need.

05:48.251 --> 05:50.961
So one inch is 83 miles.

05:54.756 --> 05:57.965
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

05:59.718 --> 06:01.886
Aloha, Oregon.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.431
It's only ten inches away.

06:07.224 --> 06:12.311
So that's 830 miles
and we've already gone 300 miles...

06:12.352 --> 06:15.105
We're going to Wyoming.

06:47.299 --> 06:49.550
(girl) What's in Wyoming?

06:51.011 --> 06:53.888
It's where your grandfather lives.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.891
I have a grandfather?

06:59.476 --> 07:01.518
Not much of one.

07:04.479 --> 07:06.648
When were you going to tell me?

07:12.152 --> 07:14.197
Oh, I'm fine.

07:17.031 --> 07:19.074
Smells like rain.

07:19.116 --> 07:21.369
It's not gonna rain today.

07:23.995 --> 07:27.456
You haven't been right
about the weather since 1972.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.748
I know what rain looks like.

07:32.962 --> 07:35.965
You got something
on your mind this morning?

07:36.047 --> 07:38.758
The goddamn bear's back.

07:42.093 --> 07:45.347
Well, what do you think
you're gonna do about it?

07:45.430 --> 07:47.556
What I should have done a year ago.

07:59.984 --> 08:01.903
(growls)

08:20.001 --> 08:24.379
Did anyone notice if he had cubs?
Did you see cubs with him?

08:27.548 --> 08:29.343
(siren)

08:58.407 --> 08:59.948
OK.

09:18.257 --> 09:21.427
- It's under control, Einar.
- You get out of the way and it will be.

09:21.511 --> 09:25.011
Come on, let's let
the Fish and Game take care of this.

09:26.849 --> 09:28.891
This isn't some pet dog they're after.

09:28.934 --> 09:32.853
I think they can tell
the difference, all right?

09:33.604 --> 09:35.731
That says what
a college education gets you.

09:35.772 --> 09:37.649
(man) Here we go.

09:37.691 --> 09:40.067
(dart gun fired. Bear growls)

09:45.905 --> 09:47.822
(car horn)

09:53.327 --> 09:54.912
Mom.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.913
Welcome to Wyoming.

09:58.372 --> 10:00.708
Mom, this is us.

10:04.461 --> 10:06.839
So is my grandpa nice?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.844
Why didn't you tell me about him?

10:24.940 --> 10:26.523
(Jean) Einar!

10:47.040 --> 10:49.041
I don't want you here.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.419
At least we agree on something.

10:53.503 --> 10:55.837
I don't wanna be here either.

10:57.421 --> 11:00.549
We need a place to stay
for about a month or so.

11:01.424 --> 11:05.471
Looks like you need every part
of your head examined.

11:06.096 --> 11:08.015
Is this yours?

11:09.767 --> 11:11.851
She's yours too.

11:15.645 --> 11:19.897
You telling me I have a grandchild
I don't know about?

11:20.940 --> 11:25.404
I'm telling you
I was pregnant at Griffin's funeral.

11:25.487 --> 11:27.406
Where you been till now?

11:28.781 --> 11:30.951
We've been on the road for two days.

11:31.826 --> 11:33.870
We lived in lowa.

11:34.662 --> 11:37.205
Now this suddenly seems like home?

11:37.747 --> 11:39.624
What's her name?

11:39.666 --> 11:41.709
My name's Griff.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.879
Griff Gilkyson.

11:45.921 --> 11:48.090
That's an unusual name for a girl.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.092
Einar, please.

11:52.925 --> 11:55.804
Just till I can earn enough
to get us out of here.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.534
There's a room in the basement.

12:45.220 --> 12:47.138
I'm sorry.

13:01.233 --> 13:05.070
Hey. I'm gonna go into town
and look for a job.

13:05.155 --> 13:07.863
You think you'll be all right here?

13:07.946 --> 13:10.783
All right, well, just... be good.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.951
Love you.

13:34.386 --> 13:36.304
(toilet flushes)

13:40.141 --> 13:42.182
I used the bathroom.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.184
I heard you.

13:46.811 --> 13:49.688
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.

13:53.818 --> 13:56.070
Is there a McDonald's in town?

13:56.153 --> 13:59.323
- You got five dollars?
- No, I don't.

13:59.365 --> 14:05.328
Well, then I don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.

14:14.293 --> 14:16.212
How was your night?

14:17.046 --> 14:19.172
All right, I guess.

14:19.256 --> 14:21.340
Left or right?

14:23.676 --> 14:25.594
Let's do the right.

14:25.678 --> 14:27.721
Left could use a rest.

14:33.016 --> 14:34.476
(winces)

14:34.518 --> 14:37.104
Pain bad all the time now?

14:37.188 --> 14:39.188
Gets my full attention.

14:39.272 --> 14:40.648
Yep.

14:48.904 --> 14:50.822
What happened with my bear?

14:50.906 --> 14:52.906
It's his own damn bear.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.161
You telling me he's still alive?

14:55.244 --> 14:58.413
He's fine.
He's in that zoo Angie built.

15:19.348 --> 15:21.600
Dreaming about the sea last night.

15:22.099 --> 15:24.977
- Did you get wet?
- (laughs)

15:25.686 --> 15:27.894
I walked right in.

15:30.108 --> 15:32.316
Felt like falling in love.

15:35.443 --> 15:37.737
Smelled like a woman.

15:38.654 --> 15:40.781
Tasted like one too.

15:40.864 --> 15:43.116
Your memory's not that good.

15:44.575 --> 15:46.286
Hey.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.496
Down there.

15:51.205 --> 15:53.334
See Jean kept her looks.

15:55.376 --> 15:57.837
Said she brought her daughter with her.

15:57.922 --> 16:00.048
She says it's Griffin's.

16:01.132 --> 16:03.049
Granddaughter.

16:04.384 --> 16:07.303
That's a nice thing for a man to have.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.308
I might go into town for breakfast.

16:13.101 --> 16:15.019
All right.

16:18.313 --> 16:20.940
Taking the girl with you?

16:21.024 --> 16:23.233
Anything else you need?

16:25.443 --> 16:27.238
Yeah, look in on the bear.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.534
- What?
- Check on the bear.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.578
Check on the?
Why the hell would I do that?

16:36.661 --> 16:38.454
'Cause I asked you to.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.367
(door opens)

17:31.248 --> 17:33.292
Are those my dad's things?

17:34.416 --> 17:36.210
Yeah, they are.

17:36.294 --> 17:38.336
Where does he live now?

17:40.338 --> 17:43.924
He's dead.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

17:44.759 --> 17:47.221
Yeah. But she said you were dead too.

17:50.472 --> 17:54.809
Are you confused about why they call
a room with a table in it a dining room?

17:54.892 --> 17:56.769
No, sir.

18:02.357 --> 18:06.151
Since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich,

18:06.193 --> 18:09.695
I'd like you to make another one at 11:30.
Will you do that?

18:09.780 --> 18:13.282
- Yes, sir.
- And take it to that man in the little house.

18:13.324 --> 18:15.534
And a glass of milk.

18:15.576 --> 18:17.494
Yes, sir.

18:19.538 --> 18:23.042
Bear? Goddamnit. (mumbles)

18:23.125 --> 18:25.376
"Go check on the bear."

18:25.458 --> 18:27.334
(engine fails to start)

18:36.135 --> 18:38.052
(ignition fails again)

18:40.139 --> 18:42.055
Goddamnit.

19:04.116 --> 19:06.742
Nice wheels, Einar!

19:06.785 --> 19:09.081
Where did you get the rig?

19:09.164 --> 19:13.875
Nancy Sidwell had this shipped up from
that retirement village where Ernie died.

19:13.958 --> 19:16.503
Maybe it was the bike killed Ernie.

19:16.585 --> 19:20.548
What killed Ernie was
a lifetime of Nancy's cooking.

19:20.630 --> 19:24.423
- Your pickup broke down again?
- Oh, hell, no. Pickup's fine.

19:24.507 --> 19:27.511
I'm just out here training
for a goddamn marathon.

19:27.552 --> 19:33.723
I like the flag. Without an orange flag
like that, you might look ridiculous.

19:59.787 --> 20:02.499
- Hello, Ken, Catherine.
- Einar.

20:06.086 --> 20:08.170
What have I got? Bills.

20:09.753 --> 20:13.174
- Morning, Einar.
- Morning yourself, Nina.

20:13.257 --> 20:15.883
Do you believe they're still
sending junk mail to my boy?

20:15.967 --> 20:19.554
Well, maybe the dead are flattered
to get a letter. Ever think about that?

20:19.637 --> 20:21.888
I'll let you know when I'm gone.

20:21.972 --> 20:25.266
Maybe I'll send you a postcard
from the other side.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.852
Hey, how's Mitch doing?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.813
Mitch - he's dreaming about the sea.

20:29.894 --> 20:32.730
Oh, yeah?
I used to live by the ocean.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.023
Up in Oregon for about a year.

20:35.066 --> 20:39.153
Yeah, too much rain if you ask me.
But I sure like the sound it makes.

20:39.236 --> 20:41.572
- Grandma.
- What's up?

20:41.654 --> 20:45.324
If you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your kitchen sink and turn on the tap.

20:45.407 --> 20:48.619
If I ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.

20:48.702 --> 20:51.204
(laughter) Hey!

20:52.707 --> 20:56.626
I wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.

20:56.708 --> 20:59.255
Oh, it's easy if you
don't stop drinking all night.

20:59.337 --> 21:03.508
- You'd know. How do you want your eggs?
- Scrambled.

21:04.508 --> 21:08.469
Hey, there, boys.
What can I get you this morning?

21:09.471 --> 21:13.890
Get down on this table and I can see if
I can stay on you till the buzzer sounds.

21:13.932 --> 21:16.393
Agh! I hope you're
having a lot of fun, Chris,

21:16.475 --> 21:20.772
'cause soon as I get one arm free,
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

21:20.854 --> 21:23.148
Oh, now look
what you went and did!

21:24.357 --> 21:26.024
Good morning, fellas.

21:26.108 --> 21:28.360
I'm gonna be your new waiter.
Want some coffee?

21:28.443 --> 21:32.113
- Why don't you screw off, you old bastard?
- What?

21:36.366 --> 21:39.410
Son, now I don't wanna
work myself short of breath.

21:39.495 --> 21:42.788
You wanna continue this?
It can be over all at once.

21:42.872 --> 21:45.791
Because that's how goddamn fast
your life can change.

21:45.874 --> 21:47.833
You believe me?

21:52.714 --> 21:54.924
Sorry for the mess.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.903
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:26.242 --> 22:28.284
My name's Griff.

22:28.325 --> 22:30.245
My name is Mitch.

22:31.038 --> 22:32.956
That for me?

22:41.171 --> 22:42.589
Thank you.

22:46.674 --> 22:49.177
Yeah, I know.

22:49.259 --> 22:52.889
I almost threw up
first time I looked at it.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.433
You feeling a little queasy?

22:55.474 --> 22:57.517
I'm fine.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.478
OK.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.772
I got queasy first time
I saw a man eat a snail.

23:03.855 --> 23:06.483
- You ever eat a snail?
- No.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.610
Me neither.
This looks good.

23:14.156 --> 23:18.535
- What happened to you?
- I was mauled by a bear.

23:19.119 --> 23:21.245
I saw a bear in a cage yesterday.

23:21.287 --> 23:23.372
Yeah. That was my bear.

23:25.124 --> 23:29.335
About a year ago, he was eating
one of your grandfather's calves

23:29.419 --> 23:34.382
and... well, we sort of
interrupted his dinner, you know.

23:34.465 --> 23:37.509
He thought we were
gonna take it away from him.

23:37.592 --> 23:40.302
You know bears -
they don't like to share.

23:42.596 --> 23:44.599
Did the bear bite Einar?

23:45.308 --> 23:47.809
No, I was closer.

23:49.810 --> 23:53.230
- I didn't know anyone ate snails.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

23:53.314 --> 23:56.443
In those fancy restaurants
up in Cheyenne,

23:56.483 --> 24:00.653
they eat 'em all the time
like there's nothing to it.

24:03.864 --> 24:05.866
Once I saw this kid eat a moth.

24:06.699 --> 24:09.869
- You could hear the crunch.
- Oh, no, no!

24:16.249 --> 24:17.707
(growling)

24:17.792 --> 24:20.419
(child) Oh, my gosh! Look at that!

24:22.004 --> 24:23.838
(woman) Einar.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.717
Hey, Angie.

24:25.758 --> 24:28.384
I didn't expect to see you in this crowd.

24:28.467 --> 24:33.014
I guess at my age it's good
to be seen just about anywhere.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.767
Well, Fish and Game
said he'd settle down in a few days.

24:36.851 --> 24:40.770
Of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.

24:40.852 --> 24:47.901
I don't get it. Nobody would pay five dollars
for the mountain lion I used to keep in here.

24:47.984 --> 24:50.028
How's Mitch?

24:50.068 --> 24:52.404
He's dreaming about the sea.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.156
I always wanted a boat.

24:55.199 --> 24:57.992
My dad used to take us out.
It was so great.

24:58.076 --> 25:00.162
What happened to the lion?

25:01.119 --> 25:03.038
He died.

25:05.123 --> 25:07.166
Lucky lion.

25:07.209 --> 25:09.293
(growling)

25:15.047 --> 25:17.049
Hello, Griffin.

25:31.646 --> 25:36.315
Well, it says here you might have
already won $15 million.

25:37.109 --> 25:40.111
Probably ought to
send it in for you, though.

25:40.194 --> 25:44.071
Probably the same damn odds
as losing a kid early.

25:44.155 --> 25:46.033
You got that done.

25:49.453 --> 25:52.330
You should know
your wife came back.

25:58.752 --> 26:02.545
You could have steered her
someplace else.

26:02.630 --> 26:07.257
Just 'cause you're dead
doesn't mean you can't be useful.

26:09.719 --> 26:11.887
See you tomorrow, boy.

26:15.973 --> 26:19.434
Kid sure looks a whole lot
like you, though.

26:20.853 --> 26:22.770
Top to bottom.

26:26.317 --> 26:28.275
(Griff) Mom!

26:29.234 --> 26:31.110
- Hey!
- I missed you.

26:31.193 --> 26:32.987
- Guess what. I got a job.
- Really?

26:33.070 --> 26:36.031
I start tomorrow.
So how was your day?

26:37.992 --> 26:39.701
Not so great, huh?

26:42.494 --> 26:44.373
(hammering)

27:28.741 --> 27:30.618
Man, I'm tired.

27:31.786 --> 27:36.664
I think half the people we served
this morning came in just to look at you.

27:36.748 --> 27:39.124
(Nina) Here you go.

27:39.207 --> 27:42.170
- What's this?
- Your half of the tips.

27:43.963 --> 27:48.049
I thought you said
you were used to being on your feet.

27:48.132 --> 27:52.263
I'm not used to telling everyone I meet
where I've been the last ten years.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.804
Well...

27:53.888 --> 27:55.599
Tell 'em you went crazy.

27:56.515 --> 27:59.018
Tell 'em you've been locked up.

28:00.727 --> 28:02.895
That's what I've been telling 'em.

28:02.978 --> 28:04.980
(Nina) Looks like we did real good today.

28:05.063 --> 28:07.525
Guess I got you to thank for that.

28:07.608 --> 28:10.776
Maybe I'll have some music
on Saturday night.

28:10.859 --> 28:15.989
Of course, then again,
you'd have to dance with Billy and Wayne.

28:16.615 --> 28:18.783
Oh, that'd be a sight.

28:33.588 --> 28:35.506
Can I help you?

28:37.922 --> 28:40.093
I'm Einar Gilkyson's daughter-in-law.

28:40.134 --> 28:43.261
Yes, I know.
Did you want to come in?

28:46.181 --> 28:48.265
Thank you.

28:48.348 --> 28:50.267
- Any calls?
- Nothing.

28:54.895 --> 28:57.147
Homemade lunch, you know.

29:03.612 --> 29:06.990
You got something there
you want me to see?

29:13.162 --> 29:16.873
It's a police report.
But I didn't press charges.

29:16.913 --> 29:22.962
A shelter worker in lowa thought I ought to
check in with authorities when I got settled.

29:24.086 --> 29:26.798
He was my boyfriend.

29:26.841 --> 29:28.924
But, um...

29:29.007 --> 29:31.509
The report's not for this time.

29:32.302 --> 29:34.386
It was for another time.

29:37.557 --> 29:39.642
I'll make a copy.

29:51.651 --> 29:52.819
That's it.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.909
What are their names?

30:00.824 --> 30:03.326
- Who?
- Your cats.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.081
They don't have any names.

30:08.914 --> 30:10.752
How do you tell 'em apart?

30:11.627 --> 30:13.586
I don't tell 'em apart.

30:19.591 --> 30:23.428
Goddamn cheap-ass, Mickey Mouse,
foreign goddamn part...

30:23.512 --> 30:25.722
Oscar and Charlie.

30:25.806 --> 30:27.807
Hi, Charlie.

30:27.890 --> 30:30.433
Is that there a water-pump belt?

30:31.393 --> 30:33.770
Why don't you use the one
out on the tractor?

30:33.853 --> 30:35.814
Why don't I use the one
out on the tractor?

30:35.897 --> 30:38.983
Hey, are you mumbling
over there or something?

30:39.067 --> 30:41.275
The tractor belt's twice this size.

30:41.360 --> 30:43.112
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:43.153 --> 30:45.030
Oh.

30:45.740 --> 30:48.241
Don't we have some
spare belts in the barn?

30:48.323 --> 30:52.159
I got a great idea.
Why don't you go back in the house?

30:52.243 --> 30:56.956
Well, uh, damn. I was...
just trying to be helpful.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.874
If you don't want my help,
I'll just sit over here and shut up.

31:00.958 --> 31:03.961
Pulling that out, it don't look like
you know what you're doing.

31:04.044 --> 31:07.253
Just shut up! OK?
Shut up. You don't know what I'm doing.

31:07.338 --> 31:09.799
- You don't know about the truck.
- Who you talking to?

31:09.882 --> 31:14.179
- Stop being a philosopher...
- Doggone second-generation immigrant,

31:14.262 --> 31:17.431
I bet I come over there
and hang my bad foot in your ass.

31:17.514 --> 31:19.223
(car horn)

31:28.565 --> 31:30.524
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

31:30.608 --> 31:33.152
- See you tomorrow?
- Yep. See ya.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.821
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

31:35.904 --> 31:37.866
- How was it?
- All right.

31:38.867 --> 31:42.243
- (Nina) See ya, Einar.
- Got some groceries for dinner.

31:45.038 --> 31:46.706
OK.

31:49.542 --> 31:52.418
- Do you wanna take these inside, sweetie?
- Sure.

31:52.418 --> 31:53.794
- Got it?
- Yep.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.631
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, there.

32:01.550 --> 32:05.637
What happened here?
Why did you stop running cows?

32:06.971 --> 32:09.223
When Griffin died, I ran out of help.

32:11.810 --> 32:15.062
Then I got older, Mitch got mauled,

32:15.938 --> 32:19.108
and I sold the stock to stay on the place.

32:22.483 --> 32:24.986
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.240
Come here, Sarah.

32:30.117 --> 32:32.411
Nope, stay here.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.705
- You finished?
- Yeah.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.831
Tell your kid to come down
out of that tree.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.711
(Griff) Come on, Charlie.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.255
Come on.
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

32:46.338 --> 32:48.256
(plate smashes)

32:54.804 --> 32:56.596
Oh, Jesus.

32:58.431 --> 33:00.307
I'm sorry.

33:00.390 --> 33:04.061
You're sorry, huh?
Well, that's just fine, then.

33:04.852 --> 33:08.815
- I'll buy you a new one.
- Oh. Just that easy?

33:10.399 --> 33:15.071
Maybe I liked that plate. In fact, maybe
that was my favorite goddamn plate!

33:15.154 --> 33:17.154
- It's just a plate.
- That's it, huh?

33:17.197 --> 33:20.658
Did it ever occur to you
that not everything can be replaced?

33:27.789 --> 33:30.166
Come down out of that tree!

33:37.046 --> 33:41.425
- You want this on the table?
- No, over here. Thank you.

33:44.388 --> 33:46.721
I'm so glad you're back, Jean.

33:55.396 --> 33:57.605
What happened to Nellie?

33:59.813 --> 34:01.901
Nellie left.

34:01.983 --> 34:04.944
About a year after we buried Griffin.

34:06.154 --> 34:09.031
Einar just never got a handle on it.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.784
And then, when he hardly
even noticed Nellie anymore, why...

34:12.868 --> 34:15.829
She found another man.
Who wouldn't?

34:16.995 --> 34:19.331
Think they live in Colorado.

34:20.750 --> 34:24.753
Do you think he blames me
for losing his wife too?

34:24.838 --> 34:26.714
I imagine he does.

34:36.678 --> 34:39.181
I don't want to stay here.

34:41.475 --> 34:43.393
What's wrong with him?

34:44.101 --> 34:46.187
Well, it's not you.

34:47.103 --> 34:49.313
He just never got over it.

34:50.940 --> 34:55.069
He really loved your dad.
You should know that.

34:55.152 --> 34:57.446
- Did you?
- Of course.

34:59.948 --> 35:02.367
You do have a plan, though, right?

35:02.450 --> 35:05.120
I mean, we don't have to stay here forever?

35:05.162 --> 35:07.372
Sure, I do.

35:07.413 --> 35:11.249
Soon as I earn enough money,
I'm gonna get us right out of here.

35:11.332 --> 35:14.544
You know what?
What do you think about...

35:14.585 --> 35:16.504
Butt, Montana?

35:21.132 --> 35:24.636
Come on, let's play.
You don't know how to read anymore?

35:27.514 --> 35:29.139
Where'd the bottle come from?

35:30.390 --> 35:32.266
The granary.

35:32.350 --> 35:35.769
It's been there for a while.
Sometimes I just like to look at it.

35:35.853 --> 35:37.771
15, two.

35:37.854 --> 35:40.148
You gonna open it?

35:40.190 --> 35:42.442
I'm not sure yet. 25.

35:42.525 --> 35:45.069
31 for two. Go.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.696
- Did you check on the bear?
- Eight.

35:48.737 --> 35:51.407
Yeah, you asked me to, didn't you?

35:52.157 --> 35:54.033
Here's a pair for two.

35:54.867 --> 35:56.953
I want you to feed him.

35:57.954 --> 35:59.998
- What?
- I want you to feed the bear.

36:00.083 --> 36:03.460
I don't trust Angie to feed
anything much past herself.

36:03.543 --> 36:07.422
"Feed the bear." "Please feed the bear."
"Bear, do you like bear shoes?"

36:07.506 --> 36:12.007
"What kind of food do you like, Bear?
Steak, chicken?"

36:12.091 --> 36:14.010
- Einar.
- What?

36:14.968 --> 36:17.095
Is her being here gonna ruin you?

36:19.431 --> 36:22.601
- The woman killed my son.
- Oh, come on.

36:22.684 --> 36:26.894
It was a car accident. They call them
accidents because it's nobody's fault.

36:26.979 --> 36:31.192
No, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.

36:31.274 --> 36:34.569
- Is that so?
- I don't give a damn what they call them.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.529
My son's dead.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.615
Your granddaughter's not.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.614
And neither were you.

36:42.575 --> 36:46.869
Have you thought about
how she's gonna remember you?

36:47.704 --> 36:53.125
You know, come to think of it,
I don't feel like playing cards tonight.

36:53.165 --> 36:56.753
Put that bottle someplace
where I don't have to look at it.

37:53.174 --> 37:56.343
You know anything about pickup trucks?

37:58.388 --> 37:59.888
Aw, shit.

37:59.973 --> 38:04.392
Hand me that half-inch
socket wrench, would you?

38:04.433 --> 38:06.935
No, no, no.
Shiny one on the top.

38:07.727 --> 38:09.313
Yep.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.982
Do you wanna see what I'm doing?

38:17.153 --> 38:19.071
That's it.

38:20.824 --> 38:22.991
- OK, see these screws here?
- Mm-hm.

38:23.034 --> 38:27.787
This one I'm tightening, this holds
this thing up which holds the pan up.

38:27.870 --> 38:31.541
If this thing comes loose when you're
driving, you'll be sitting on the road.

38:31.624 --> 38:34.376
And that's not what you want to be doing...

38:34.418 --> 38:36.502
How come you and Einar don't get along?

38:36.586 --> 38:39.004
You're practically his daughter.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.547
What I am is his dead son's wife.

38:43.217 --> 38:47.595
He's always been really good to me.
He's the first friend I met here.

38:49.347 --> 38:52.098
I am not in the mood for their crap.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.309
I'll take 'em.

38:56.186 --> 39:00.231
- The special today is the enchilada plate.
- Thank you.

39:00.315 --> 39:04.108
They're good enchiladas.
Served by good people.

39:04.982 --> 39:06.902
I'm a good person.

39:07.861 --> 39:12.532
I'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit off men.

39:12.615 --> 39:14.576
Don't push me.

39:14.659 --> 39:18.747
I mean, I couldn't even take a pinch of crap
from two little cheesedicks like you.

39:18.830 --> 39:22.497
- (Einar) OK, crank it.
- (engine fails to start)

39:22.540 --> 39:24.459
Again.

39:25.458 --> 39:26.794
Again.

39:26.876 --> 39:29.088
(engine starts)

39:31.840 --> 39:33.757
(engine revs)

39:35.595 --> 39:37.720
Take your foot off the gas.

39:38.721 --> 39:40.848
Take your foot off the gas!

39:47.352 --> 39:49.521
Is that for lunch?

39:49.605 --> 39:51.898
It's for a bear.

39:51.981 --> 39:55.318
Who the hell knows
what a bear eats anyway?

40:09.162 --> 40:11.248
Did I ask you to do that?

40:12.248 --> 40:14.250
Don't bears like honey?

40:14.292 --> 40:16.378
Winnie the Pooh does.

40:33.349 --> 40:35.182
- Oh, hey.
- Thought you were sick.

40:35.267 --> 40:37.684
Haven't seen you for a few days.

40:37.727 --> 40:42.982
It's only a two-restaurant town, so I try
to spread the county's money around.

40:43.857 --> 40:47.152
Meatloaf. Can I have onion rings
instead of mashed potatoes?

40:47.194 --> 40:49.947
Onion... Sure, I'll ask.

40:53.074 --> 40:55.324
Could you give me a ride home after work?

40:56.453 --> 40:57.870
Sure.

40:59.036 --> 41:00.621
(growls)

41:01.540 --> 41:03.749
(Griff) He looks like he's dancing.

41:03.832 --> 41:06.626
Well, maybe just happy to see
a girl with a sack of meat.

41:06.710 --> 41:10.088
I'll give you some here.
Why don't you toss this in?

41:22.557 --> 41:26.267
- He likes the honey.
- I think he does.

41:26.351 --> 41:30.438
Is that really the bear
that hurt Mr. Bradley?

41:30.478 --> 41:32.690
He's the one.

41:48.953 --> 41:50.955
(Jean) I don't wanna go right home.

41:50.998 --> 41:53.333
- Not just yet.
- You don't?

41:53.415 --> 41:55.793
Can't we just drive a little?

42:06.511 --> 42:09.554
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna be here about three more weeks.

42:09.637 --> 42:12.223
I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through it.

42:14.725 --> 42:16.727
Three weeks, huh?

42:19.311 --> 42:21.856
I don't wanna be in love, Crane.

42:32.196 --> 42:34.198
(moaning)

42:46.875 --> 42:48.545
Don't start without me.

42:51.797 --> 42:54.799
- (Einar) What's that?
- A flower.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.842
That's not a flower - it's a weed.

42:59.637 --> 43:01.638
It's pretty, though.

43:01.720 --> 43:06.310
- Don't you think it's pretty?
- Yeah, I think it's lovely.

43:06.353 --> 43:08.770
You want to wait a little longer
for your mother?

43:08.855 --> 43:11.230
- Just a little bit.
- OK.

43:16.776 --> 43:19.278
I had a music teacher
who was a lesbian.

43:26.742 --> 43:28.953
You guys are gay, right?

43:29.035 --> 43:30.912
(coughs)

43:34.832 --> 43:38.668
I'd think after 40 years of working together,
one of us would notice, don't you?

43:38.751 --> 43:43.049
Well, Einar, I always thought
you had really lovely hands.

43:43.132 --> 43:46.008
- You did? You never told me that.
- (Mitch laughs)

43:46.092 --> 43:49.595
I mean, it's cool.
Everybody needs love.

43:49.678 --> 43:51.929
You got that part right, little girl.

43:53.013 --> 43:55.225
(Einar) Jeez, what's next?

43:55.934 --> 43:57.726
Hey!

43:59.644 --> 44:03.314
- Hey, yourself. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

44:03.398 --> 44:07.025
Good. There's somebody
I want you to meet.

44:08.276 --> 44:11.071
Griff, this is Sheriff Curtis.

44:11.155 --> 44:13.198
Nice to meet you, Griff.

44:14.658 --> 44:17.618
- Are you hungry?
- There isn't enough.

44:17.702 --> 44:21.913
I gotta swing back
through town anyway. So I'll see ya.

44:21.996 --> 44:25.666
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Take care of yourself, Crane.

44:27.251 --> 44:29.212
- I don't like him.
- I don't remember asking.

44:29.295 --> 44:31.296
I don't remember you ever asking me.

44:31.378 --> 44:34.130
Hey, I don't need your permission.

44:37.550 --> 44:40.554
You confused about how
to treat a guest in my house?

44:40.597 --> 44:42.597
It's just some guy my mom brought home.

44:42.680 --> 44:46.391
I expect you to be pleasant
to whoever comes to my door.

44:51.229 --> 44:52.480
Yes, sir.

44:52.563 --> 44:55.940
Unless it's some guy
looking to sell his angle on God.

44:56.023 --> 44:59.110
There's no excuse for that bullshit.

45:02.029 --> 45:07.867
Well, all right, then. Let's give a try
at these good-looking sandwiches.

45:32.347 --> 45:34.848
There you go.
Hold it right about here.

45:34.930 --> 45:36.058
OK.

45:36.140 --> 45:40.854
- His foot's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh, yes, it is. Look at that calf run.

45:40.895 --> 45:42.730
He's off and gone.

45:44.524 --> 45:47.567
(Einar) Oops. That's a little bit low.

45:51.445 --> 45:54.030
- Yeah!
- I got it!

45:55.450 --> 45:57.992
- (Griff) Look at that!
- Oh, yeah.

45:57.992 --> 46:01.496
Go on, try it again.
There you go.

46:06.081 --> 46:09.543
You got any more improvements
you wanna make around here?

46:09.627 --> 46:11.669
I thought I'd
straighten some of this mess.

46:11.711 --> 46:13.964
Thought Mitch might
want to work on something.

46:14.047 --> 46:17.799
- Did you ask him about it?
- (Mitch) Well, of course she did.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.720
Now that we've got interesting
company around here, I...

46:21.803 --> 46:23.847
I feel inspired.

46:26.389 --> 46:28.808
Excuse me.
I gotta go to work.

46:41.739 --> 46:43.697
You wanna know
what I dreamed last night?

46:43.781 --> 46:45.823
What?

46:45.823 --> 46:49.952
I dreamed you weren't
such a miserable son of a bitch.

46:50.745 --> 46:54.623
That's not dreaming.
That's wishful thinking.

46:55.499 --> 46:59.336
Did you hear anything
unusual last night?

46:59.419 --> 47:03.255
Yeah. Somebody poking around
down by the river.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.673
I found some footprints.

47:07.968 --> 47:09.718
This.

47:17.182 --> 47:19.225
I sure do miss smoking.

47:20.185 --> 47:22.061
So do I.

47:30.359 --> 47:31.402
Hey.

47:32.402 --> 47:35.323
Hey! What are you doing here?

47:35.406 --> 47:38.743
- We're going to Angie's zoo.
- Really?

47:38.827 --> 47:40.870
What kind of pies you got today, Nina?

47:40.952 --> 47:44.582
Hey! I got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan.

47:44.664 --> 47:47.542
Guaranteed to make your teeth ache.

47:47.625 --> 47:51.088
Chocolate pecan, please.
With ice cream.

47:51.128 --> 47:54.256
Two chocolate pecan, one with ice cream.
Kid's got young teeth.

47:54.297 --> 47:56.216
Coming right up.

47:59.218 --> 48:01.094
Be right back.

48:01.178 --> 48:02.972
Crane.

48:04.848 --> 48:07.141
Einar.

48:09.268 --> 48:11.645
She capture your interest?

48:12.477 --> 48:15.439
Have you thought about the girl?
They're a set.

48:15.522 --> 48:17.732
Can I get you anything else, Crane?

48:17.815 --> 48:19.776
No. Just the check.

48:20.860 --> 48:22.570
OK.

48:27.282 --> 48:31.995
How does the law stand on shooting
somebody on your property?

48:32.871 --> 48:37.375
Well, if you didn't want to go to prison,
they'd have to be in your house.

48:37.459 --> 48:40.793
- That's what I thought.
- You think you got a problem?

48:40.876 --> 48:43.046
I'll let you know.

48:46.923 --> 48:48.341
Hey.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.677
You wanna hand me that rasp?

48:53.932 --> 48:56.599
No, those are pliers.
The rasp, next to...

48:57.974 --> 49:00.062
- This?
- That's it. Yep.

49:00.978 --> 49:03.230
Are there really cowgirls?

49:05.648 --> 49:08.066
Haven't you ever ridden a horse before?

49:08.149 --> 49:12.612
No. There weren't any horses
around Gary's apartment.

49:14.446 --> 49:16.991
He was my mom's boyfriend.

49:17.033 --> 49:19.534
We lived with him for two years.

49:21.493 --> 49:24.162
My mom had another boyfriend
before Gary.

49:24.204 --> 49:27.874
His name was Hank.
He didn't have any horses either.

49:28.876 --> 49:31.336
Hank didn't hit my mom like Gary did.

49:31.418 --> 49:33.711
He was just mean with his words.

49:33.795 --> 49:35.671
Like you.

49:40.218 --> 49:46.056
I can see where not learning to ride a horse
would be a disadvantage for a cowgirl.

49:46.139 --> 49:47.933
- You wanna try?
- Yeah.

49:48.016 --> 49:50.100
Here, grab that blanket.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.035
(Griff) What's that?

50:11.536 --> 50:13.870
Wanna have a look?

50:21.294 --> 50:23.378
Good afternoon, boy.

50:27.632 --> 50:30.550
Your father was sure first-rate.

50:30.634 --> 50:32.721
I miss him.

50:33.637 --> 50:35.764
I wish I missed him.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.268
You would if you'd known him.

50:42.351 --> 50:43.940
Stay.

50:57.646 --> 51:00.194
Your mom's boyfriend in lowa, he smoke?

51:01.367 --> 51:03.203
Yeah, a lot.

51:08.761 --> 51:10.933
Did he hit you?

51:10.975 --> 51:12.898
Mostly my mom.

51:13.901 --> 51:16.659
Jimmy. Jimmy, no, no.

51:22.873 --> 51:25.749
My parents scraped and saved
to get us out of El Paso.

51:25.834 --> 51:29.627
To get a quiet place,
far away from everything.

51:31.545 --> 51:33.922
(Crane) Then they put
an interstate through it.

51:33.965 --> 51:36.799
(Jean) This would have killed them.

51:36.882 --> 51:39.675
- I remember your parents.
- You do?

51:40.467 --> 51:45.806
- Yeah, they were good people.
- What a mess. Did you know Griffin?

51:45.888 --> 51:47.099
Yeah.

51:47.182 --> 51:50.851
He was two years behind me
in high school.

51:52.101 --> 51:54.145
Do you know how he died?

51:55.605 --> 51:57.731
Yeah, it was, uh...

51:57.772 --> 52:01.442
Up in Calgary at the stampede.
A car accident.

52:04.652 --> 52:07.739
Guess everybody in town knows that.

52:07.779 --> 52:10.365
Well, it was a long time ago.

52:14.325 --> 52:16.453
I was driving, you know.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.334
Guess everybody in town knows that too.

52:37.925 --> 52:40.262
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

52:42.472 --> 52:46.559
Well, I'm not so sure I'm happy
to see you in here, Einar.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.060
How about a club soda, Eileen?

52:49.143 --> 52:51.227
I can do that for you.

53:00.943 --> 53:04.863
- I hear you have a granddaughter.
- Yeah. By God, I do.

53:04.946 --> 53:07.199
How old is she?

53:07.240 --> 53:11.784
She's still shiny. She still expects
everything's gonna turn out all right.

53:11.825 --> 53:14.869
- (man) Shit!
- That's a good age.

53:14.953 --> 53:17.329
(man) Here, buy yourself a fucking drink.

53:17.413 --> 53:19.875
You're one lucky son of a bitch.

53:22.209 --> 53:24.377
You know those guys?

53:24.461 --> 53:27.171
The one in the hat
is Jed Spear's boy, Josh.

53:27.213 --> 53:29.421
And the other guy?

53:29.505 --> 53:32.048
Some dude from the Midwest.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.603
Einar.

53:47.686 --> 53:50.772
- Her ex-boyfriend's in town.
- Yeah, I know he is.

53:50.854 --> 53:53.065
He's staying down
at the Sage Creek Motel.

53:53.108 --> 53:55.148
Why in the hell didn't you arrest him?

53:55.191 --> 53:58.944
'Cause I can't do anything, except keep
an eye on him. Unless he bothers her.

53:59.027 --> 54:01.237
Does she know he's here?

54:01.320 --> 54:03.279
I haven't told her yet.

54:03.320 --> 54:06.782
Look, if he'd been out at your place,
I could make that enough.

54:06.866 --> 54:09.700
You'd let me know if he'd been
out there bothering you?

54:09.784 --> 54:12.243
Oh, he doesn't bother me one little bit.

54:14.663 --> 54:16.749
- Jesus.
- (printer whirs)

54:21.042 --> 54:22.794
Here.

54:36.262 --> 54:38.346
Bad news.

54:38.596 --> 54:40.016
Bad news.

54:40.057 --> 54:41.891
That's 15-2,

54:41.933 --> 54:43.434
15-4...

54:43.518 --> 54:48.687
That's two runs of three
and a pair which puts me out.

54:49.396 --> 54:53.566
- I haven't had a decent hand all night.
- Well, don't growl. You dealt half of them.

54:53.650 --> 54:56.109
I'm not growling.
Give it here.

54:59.779 --> 55:04.907
- You want some help getting to bed?
- No, I'll manage that.

55:19.084 --> 55:21.462
I always thought
this was one of your best.

55:23.212 --> 55:24.962
Why, thank you.

55:27.799 --> 55:32.596
Ever wish you'd lived a different life rather
than living up here and working with me?

55:32.677 --> 55:34.512
No.

55:34.554 --> 55:37.975
I was always happy
that I found work that suited me.

55:38.850 --> 55:43.562
Since I was a kid,
all I ever wanted to be was a cowboy.

55:44.103 --> 55:46.021
Shit.

55:46.063 --> 55:49.024
- How about now?
- Now too.

55:52.734 --> 55:56.153
Mind if I leave Griff here with you
for a while till her mother comes home?

55:56.195 --> 55:58.612
There's an errand in town
I'd like to run.

55:58.695 --> 56:02.991
Be all right with me
if she stayed up here all the time.

56:03.783 --> 56:05.242
Hey.

56:05.867 --> 56:08.035
Be careful with that errand.

56:38.602 --> 56:40.520
(knock at door)

56:45.313 --> 56:47.066
Yeah?

56:54.779 --> 56:57.405
Take it easy, buddy.
What do you want?

56:59.447 --> 57:01.949
I'm helping you pack.

57:05.787 --> 57:08.203
You don't know how much I love her.

57:08.246 --> 57:12.083
Your love was written all over her face
when she got here.

57:12.167 --> 57:16.544
There's nothing more useless than running
after a woman that doesn't want you.

57:16.627 --> 57:20.799
She wanted me to find her. If she didn't,
she wouldn't have come back here.

57:20.882 --> 57:23.216
Pull over. Here.

57:37.517 --> 57:41.187
Keep going.
I see you back here again, I'll kill you.

57:42.437 --> 57:44.732
You've seen too many westerns, old man.

57:44.815 --> 57:47.400
That doesn't exactly work in your favor.

57:56.990 --> 57:59.948
- You need a ride?
- A ride would be fine.

58:03.995 --> 58:06.831
- That man threaten you?
- Yeah, he sure as hell did.

58:06.915 --> 58:10.250
Jean Gilkyson's a friend of mine.
She doesn't want you here.

58:10.334 --> 58:14.252
- You don't know her like I do.
- No, you're right. I don't.

58:14.336 --> 58:18.506
I'll make this simple for you -
I don't want you here.

58:19.672 --> 58:21.884
Now, get going.

58:34.016 --> 58:38.395
Is this something we're gonna
have to talk a lot about?

58:38.479 --> 58:40.105
No, Einar.

58:40.187 --> 58:43.189
We never have to talk about this again.

58:45.815 --> 58:46.775
Jean?

58:46.775 --> 58:47.735
Jean?

58:47.987 --> 58:49.445
Jean?

58:51.529 --> 58:55.197
- What?
- Get dressed. I wanna talk to you.

59:04.248 --> 59:06.166
What is it?

59:09.001 --> 59:12.336
Just had a chat with your ex-boyfriend.

59:12.419 --> 59:14.504
Thought you oughta know he was in town.

59:14.588 --> 59:16.714
- You mean Gary's here?
- He was.

59:18.590 --> 59:21.552
- Gary's in town?
- He left.

59:23.386 --> 59:25.304
Well, we should call Crane.

59:25.389 --> 59:27.473
Crane knows all about it.

59:29.265 --> 59:32.017
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me something. I'm a little confused.

59:32.059 --> 59:35.687
By bachelor number one
and bachelor number two.

59:35.770 --> 59:39.815
Are you screwing Crane Curtis
for protection or sport?

59:44.192 --> 59:47.069
Would you like to ask your daughter
how she feels about it?

59:47.153 --> 59:49.613
Don't bring Griff into this.
You don't know about her.

59:49.695 --> 59:53.365
- And whose fault is that?
- Oh, it's my fault, Einar. Right?

59:53.449 --> 59:57.077
Isn't it my fault?
Isn't everything my fault?

01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:11.671
Griffin flipped a coin.

01:00:12.963 --> 01:00:15.174
What are you talking about?

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.470
Griffin flipped a coin and I lost.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:25.014
So I was the one driving.

01:00:26.265 --> 01:00:30.184
It was three o'clock in the morning
and we were both tired.

01:00:30.267 --> 01:00:34.521
We wanted to make it down
to the rodeo in Great Falls.

01:00:34.562 --> 01:00:36.648
It was a flipped coin?

01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:39.983
What was it - a quarter?
Was it a nickel?

01:00:40.025 --> 01:00:43.194
- I don't remember what it was.
- I wanna know what killed my boy!

01:00:43.237 --> 01:00:45.362
I killed him, Einar.

01:00:45.446 --> 01:00:47.654
Is that what you wanna hear?

01:00:48.573 --> 01:00:50.614
It wasn't the change in our pockets

01:00:50.699 --> 01:00:53.450
or the weak-ass coffee or the rain.

01:00:53.492 --> 01:00:55.577
It was me.

01:00:58.246 --> 01:01:01.791
I fell asleep
and I flipped the car six times.

01:01:03.209 --> 01:01:05.459
I killed Griffin.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.421
You got no argument from me.

01:01:10.879 --> 01:01:13.673
You think it's something I forget?

01:01:13.756 --> 01:01:17.719
You think I'm not sick with it
every day of my life?

01:01:20.179 --> 01:01:23.723
But I tried to keep living
and you haven't.

01:01:23.807 --> 01:01:26.058
Is that why you hate me so much?

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:29.767
You know, you act like I killed you
the day Griffin died.

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.478
Well, great.

01:01:31.561 --> 01:01:34.648
Lie all the way down
and we'll bury you.

01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:39.943
What's the matter? You're afraid
no one will come to the funeral?

01:01:40.485 --> 01:01:44.529
- We'll talk about your leaving tomorrow.
- We're done talking.

01:02:48.283 --> 01:02:50.534
Just so you know,

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:53.955
I have been trying.

01:02:56.831 --> 01:02:58.915
But forgiving...

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.919
just isn't easy for me.

01:03:07.173 --> 01:03:09.383
Son of a bitch.
What the hell did he call it?

01:03:09.424 --> 01:03:13.386
What - does he think he's a preacher
or some goddamn thing?

01:03:13.469 --> 01:03:15.387
Know-it-all.

01:03:20.934 --> 01:03:23.058
(Jean) I'm sorry
we woke you up so early.

01:03:23.143 --> 01:03:26.436
That's OK. I'm not
a great sleeper anyway.

01:03:29.814 --> 01:03:32.816
Hey, I got a regular mattress
out in the storage shed.

01:03:32.899 --> 01:03:36.526
Maybe you and I can wrestle it
in here after work.

01:03:48.535 --> 01:03:50.994
Did you drink the whole bottle?

01:03:51.704 --> 01:03:55.583
She left. She walked out of here
and took the kid.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:59.210
That her idea or yours?

01:04:00.252 --> 01:04:02.086
I didn't drink the whole thing.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:05.630
Which side of your ass you want
the needle in this morning?

01:04:05.715 --> 01:04:06.882
Left.

01:04:10.636 --> 01:04:12.388
(winces)

01:04:12.429 --> 01:04:15.431
Well, what'd you dream about last night?

01:04:15.473 --> 01:04:17.556
I didn't dream at all.

01:04:18.891 --> 01:04:24.229
I lay awake all night, wondering if you'd
ever stop blaming the world for whatever.

01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:28.648
Wondering if you'd be able
to hold on to the family you've got.

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:31.691
I managed to hang on to you, didn't I?

01:04:31.774 --> 01:04:35.611
Have you ever wondered
why I'm the only one left?

01:04:37.195 --> 01:04:40.824
Well, I have my boy.
I have his memories.

01:04:43.365 --> 01:04:44.952
Yeah.

01:04:45.993 --> 01:04:49.245
Maybe he'll remember how desperately
he wanted to get out of here.

01:04:49.288 --> 01:04:52.248
How bad he wanted a life of his own.

01:04:52.332 --> 01:04:54.917
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd jerk you out and kick your ass.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.960
Oh, talk sense.

01:04:57.044 --> 01:05:00.753
I never saw the day you thought
you could kick my ass, Einar.

01:05:03.047 --> 01:05:05.132
- Einar!
- What?

01:05:06.967 --> 01:05:09.010
I wanna go see the bear.

01:05:10.095 --> 01:05:11.888
You've seen the bear.

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:14.681
- I want you to take me to Angie's.
- You're not up to it.

01:05:14.765 --> 01:05:17.350
I'm not asking permission, goddamnit!
I want a ride!

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:18.893
Well, then call a taxi.

01:05:24.146 --> 01:05:26.855
- I'm going back.
- What?

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.649
I'm staying with my grandpa
and Mr. Bradley.

01:05:29.691 --> 01:05:31.776
- The hell you are, Griff.
- Yes, I am.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.613
No, you're not!

01:05:33.694 --> 01:05:35.906
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying.

01:05:35.945 --> 01:05:38.280
I'm going back, OK?

01:05:39.907 --> 01:05:44.619
You make decisions like they don't matter
for anybody else but you!

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:49.956
That is not true.
I always think about you first.

01:05:51.165 --> 01:05:53.500
Then it should start to show.

01:05:58.545 --> 01:06:02.924
Griff! Get back here!
I'm not gonna say it again.

01:06:02.966 --> 01:06:04.718
(Nina) Let her go.

01:06:04.801 --> 01:06:08.679
Let her go be with
her grandfather for a while.

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:14.183
Do you think I'm a shitty mother?

01:06:14.225 --> 01:06:17.187
I think you're doing the best you can.

01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:28.818
That's her second-grade picture.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.735
Of your daughter?

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.362
Yeah.

01:06:33.238 --> 01:06:38.741
We were having a picnic at the river
and she went for a swim.

01:06:38.782 --> 01:06:40.994
She wanted to practice.

01:06:41.076 --> 01:06:43.453
She was a great swimmer.

01:06:47.122 --> 01:06:48.999
And I, uh...

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:51.836
I looked away for a minute.

01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:55.503
And she was... gone.

01:06:58.088 --> 01:07:00.006
She was...

01:07:06.637 --> 01:07:10.182
I would do anything
to have that minute back.

01:07:11.307 --> 01:07:13.391
But I'm never gonna.

01:07:17.353 --> 01:07:21.397
- Nina, I'm...
- We're not supposed to outlive our kids.

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:25.025
You have to understand that about Einar.

01:07:34.616 --> 01:07:38.450
- Where's your mother?
- She's staying with Nina.

01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:43.790
You walked all the way
out here by yourself?

01:07:43.874 --> 01:07:46.083
I got hungry.

01:07:51.335 --> 01:07:54.172
Want one egg or two?
We got a lot to do today.

01:07:54.255 --> 01:07:56.506
How about two?

01:08:02.136 --> 01:08:04.594
What are we gonna do with that?

01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:08.558
You spread it around
so we don't have to walk in it.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:13.602
Here, slide on over here
and take the wheel.

01:08:13.643 --> 01:08:15.603
- Come on.
- I can't drive.

01:08:15.687 --> 01:08:18.398
You're not gonna be driving.
You're gonna be steering.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:20.356
Come on. You can do it.

01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:25.528
Turn before you get to that fence.
Don't touch anything else.

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:49.002
Yeah.

01:08:50.087 --> 01:08:51.837
OK.

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:56.881
- Set.
- Yeah.

01:08:56.965 --> 01:08:59.218
Six o'clock in the morning,
I wake up to gunfire.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.511
And I look out the window
and everything's shot to hell in the yard.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:04.805
- Jonesy, it's pottery.
- Still, man.

01:09:04.848 --> 01:09:08.475
Shouldn't you be catching people
who are shooting the neighborhood up?

01:09:08.515 --> 01:09:12.270
Why the hell didn't you tell me
Gary was in town?

01:09:12.353 --> 01:09:14.478
Excuse me.

01:09:16.354 --> 01:09:20.316
- I didn't think you'd want to see him.
- Well, I had a right to know.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.901
I just... I would have thought
you'd had enough of him.

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:26.529
Come on, Crane. Why don't you ask me
what you really wanna know?

01:09:26.572 --> 01:09:28.948
Why didn't I just walk away
the first time he hit me?

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:31.823
Why didn't I just call the police? Right?
It's so simple.

01:09:31.866 --> 01:09:35.868
- Crane, are you gonna deal with this?
- Just give me a second here.

01:09:35.953 --> 01:09:37.078
Jean.

01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:40.247
(Jonesy) I couldn't care less
about his personal problems.

01:10:08.017 --> 01:10:11.311
(Griff) There's a buffalo over there.
His name is Ronnie.

01:10:11.395 --> 01:10:13.732
And then there's two wolves.

01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:15.939
Tom and Jerry.

01:10:20.985 --> 01:10:22.862
Come on. Look.

01:10:23.529 --> 01:10:25.446
Food.

01:10:26.698 --> 01:10:28.615
Come on.

01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:32.701
Aren't you hungry?

01:10:35.203 --> 01:10:37.080
You had enough?

01:10:38.123 --> 01:10:40.042
Yeah.

01:10:41.625 --> 01:10:43.835
Yeah, I've had all I need.

01:11:07.561 --> 01:11:09.936
No, no, no, that's OK.

01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:14.774
I gotta run to the feed store for a minute.
You think you can fix Mitch some lunch?

01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:16.151
Sure.

01:11:16.235 --> 01:11:18.152
OK, then.

01:11:26.698 --> 01:11:29.076
(Mitch) Einar?

01:11:29.117 --> 01:11:30.827
Einar!

01:11:33.997 --> 01:11:35.914
- Mitch?
- Griff.

01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:40.586
- Get Einar for me.
- He went to town.

01:11:40.667 --> 01:11:42.420
Oh, no.

01:11:42.503 --> 01:11:45.004
Do you know where
he keeps my medicine?

01:11:45.088 --> 01:11:47.381
- In the refrigerator?
- Go get it for me.

01:11:47.465 --> 01:11:50.760
- Right now?
- Quick as you can.

01:11:50.842 --> 01:11:52.427
OK.

01:12:04.685 --> 01:12:07.521
- OK.
- OK. Good girl.

01:12:07.563 --> 01:12:10.398
Do you... you know how to load it?

01:12:11.649 --> 01:12:14.651
Yeah, just... That's it.

01:12:17.777 --> 01:12:19.404
OK.

01:12:26.325 --> 01:12:30.998
Pull the pants down,
stick it in me and push the plunger down.

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:34.124
(grunts)

01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:52.929
Was that OK?

01:12:56.223 --> 01:13:00.060
It was so smooth,
I thought my mom had done it.

01:13:03.102 --> 01:13:04.728
Thank you.

01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:12.109
Hey.

01:13:13.985 --> 01:13:15.944
Jean.

01:13:17.572 --> 01:13:21.907
As it turns out, you're right.
I'm a complete asshole.

01:13:24.618 --> 01:13:27.579
I never judged you
for being with him, though.

01:13:27.661 --> 01:13:29.665
You're wrong about that.

01:13:30.455 --> 01:13:32.832
You made it stop.
You left him.

01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:42.173
You wanna know the ugly little truth?

01:13:44.715 --> 01:13:49.220
You stay because you don't think
you deserve any better.

01:13:50.345 --> 01:13:53.598
'Cause you think
it's the best you can do.

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.901
It's Mr. Bradley.

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:24.369
How you doing?

01:14:25.245 --> 01:14:28.206
We can't just leave him there, Einar.

01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:32.917
We walked into his business.

01:14:33.919 --> 01:14:37.170
Hell, he was just doing what bears do.

01:14:37.213 --> 01:14:39.629
We can't punish him for that.

01:14:42.715 --> 01:14:45.678
You got to let him go, Einar.

01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:47.969
Get him out of that cage.

01:14:49.888 --> 01:14:53.183
Don't you lie here
and think I can do that.

01:15:02.482 --> 01:15:06.233
You know, I can get myself
shaved in the morning.

01:15:06.275 --> 01:15:08.985
- All the way dressed too.
- OK.

01:15:09.068 --> 01:15:14.614
Could probably manage to stick myself
in the butt with one of those syringes.

01:15:14.697 --> 01:15:19.910
But what I can't do is continue
to lie here every day and watch you mourn

01:15:19.951 --> 01:15:23.202
for a life you think you should have had.

01:15:27.749 --> 01:15:33.419
There are people everywhere
who think they got dealt a bad hand, Einar.

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:46.597
Hey.

01:15:47.348 --> 01:15:49.224
Did I give him too much?

01:15:49.305 --> 01:15:51.307
No.

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:53.476
You did great today.

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:05.651
(growls)

01:16:10.655 --> 01:16:12.865
(roars)

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.992
Goddamn bear.

01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:23.873
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:16:25.332 --> 01:16:27.752
I never do anything right.

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:35.005
Well, what do you think?

01:16:46.431 --> 01:16:48.307
Attagirl.

01:16:50.768 --> 01:16:54.644
- Right, let's try third. Let the clutch out.
- Third?

01:16:54.728 --> 01:16:57.439
Now, let's go to the left.

01:16:57.522 --> 01:16:59.523
Not too hard.

01:17:00.398 --> 01:17:04.192
OK, that's good.
You're getting the hang of it.

01:17:05.943 --> 01:17:09.739
There you go. I think we're
gonna get this thing done.

01:17:10.281 --> 01:17:13.324
Hey, Griff.
How's life on the ranch?

01:17:13.409 --> 01:17:15.450
It's good.

01:17:15.535 --> 01:17:18.495
Jean, you got two customers out here.

01:17:21.415 --> 01:17:22.624
Hey.

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:26.043
- We're just visiting, OK?
- OK.

01:17:31.838 --> 01:17:35.632
I miss you.
What you been doing?

01:17:35.715 --> 01:17:37.801
Einar's been teaching me how to drive.

01:17:37.885 --> 01:17:43.220
Why don't you go look to see
what Nina's got in the kitchen for special?

01:17:43.263 --> 01:17:45.182
- OK?
- OK.

01:17:48.851 --> 01:17:51.644
Would you care if I took her camping?

01:17:51.728 --> 01:17:54.897
Thanks for bringing her in, Einar.

01:17:56.522 --> 01:17:59.733
- Did she say driving?
- It's a ranch.

01:17:59.817 --> 01:18:02.527
- She's 11.
- I know, I know. She...

01:18:03.569 --> 01:18:05.947
But she's a good girl.

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:11.241
Good kids don't get that way by accident.

01:18:17.621 --> 01:18:21.832
- Is that a compliment?
- It's just the way it is.

01:18:27.127 --> 01:18:29.672
What else you been teaching her?

01:18:31.132 --> 01:18:33.465
I don't know enough

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:36.928
to know what to teach a girl.

01:18:39.094 --> 01:18:41.055
What I'm saying...

01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:45.057
is if you wanna come back
to the ranch, that's...

01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:47.351
that's gonna be OK.

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:57.650
Maybe tomorrow then,
when you get back.

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:02.320
Tomorrow would be fine.

01:19:03.321 --> 01:19:05.948
I think camping would be great.

01:19:06.031 --> 01:19:08.116
She'll love that.

01:19:14.413 --> 01:19:17.956
- Do you want all of these?
- Yep, all of 'em. Hold on to those.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.834
What's the medicine for?

01:19:19.874 --> 01:19:22.501
When we get that bear in the cage,
I'm gonna give him a shot.

01:19:22.585 --> 01:19:26.713
That way, he can sleep
all the way up to the mountain.

01:19:39.514 --> 01:19:41.724
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:19:41.765 --> 01:19:44.518
- Jesus Christ, Gary.
- How are ya?

01:19:48.144 --> 01:19:50.229
God, you look great.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:55.232
I thought you left town.

01:19:56.026 --> 01:19:59.027
Well, I wanted to see you.

01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:01.156
You know I miss you.

01:20:02.363 --> 01:20:06.825
I don't want you here, Gary.
Can't you understand that?

01:20:11.328 --> 01:20:15.165
Must be nice for Griff,
living up here with her grandfather.

01:20:15.248 --> 01:20:17.750
Country living and all.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:20.501
Of course, it's not for you.

01:20:20.585 --> 01:20:22.628
Just give it up, Gary.

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.755
I'm not coming back to you.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.215
Can we just at least sit down?
Have a drink or some kind of...

01:20:29.299 --> 01:20:31.803
Offer me a coffee or some...

01:20:37.931 --> 01:20:41.268
It's pretty country up here.

01:20:41.351 --> 01:20:43.560
Might stick around a while.

01:21:12.248 --> 01:21:14.289
We're gonna get caught.

01:21:14.332 --> 01:21:17.042
These are government guys
we're stealing this from.

01:21:17.126 --> 01:21:20.253
They went home to dinner a long time ago.

01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:23.589
I thought you said we're just borrowing it.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:27.883
As long as I pay my taxes,
it's the same thing. Let's go.

01:21:58.196 --> 01:22:02.034
OK, now scoot on over
and get ready to back up.

01:22:04.826 --> 01:22:07.329
Come on ahead. Easy.

01:22:07.412 --> 01:22:09.331
Come on.

01:22:14.083 --> 01:22:16.127
Whoa.

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:17.460
OK.

01:22:37.309 --> 01:22:39.228
Here.

01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:44.147
Hold that still.

01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:47.567
- When I tell you, you start cranking.
- OK.

01:22:49.025 --> 01:22:50.985
(growls)

01:23:04.788 --> 01:23:08.582
- I'm a little bit scared.
- That makes two of us.

01:23:09.331 --> 01:23:11.418
Start cranking.

01:23:30.682 --> 01:23:32.890
OK, now get in the truck.

01:23:46.942 --> 01:23:49.193
OK.

01:24:04.455 --> 01:24:06.248
Come on.

01:24:20.426 --> 01:24:21.677
(roars)

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:35.101
Einar!

01:24:35.184 --> 01:24:37.646
- Get behind me. Get behind me.
- Einar, I'm sorry.

01:24:37.688 --> 01:24:39.606
Get in the truck.

01:24:41.231 --> 01:24:44.691
Walk slowly and don't look right at him.
Get in the truck!

01:24:46.902 --> 01:24:48.446
Go on.

01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:54.658
Look here.

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:07.417
(car horn)

01:25:15.589 --> 01:25:18.968
- Einar!
- Wait a minute. Oh, shit.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.512
Are you OK?

01:25:22.596 --> 01:25:25.514
I think that he went through an artery.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:30.934
I think you'd better get me to a hospital.

01:25:35.812 --> 01:25:38.189
- Oh!
- Sorry.

01:25:40.316 --> 01:25:42.233
(phone rings)

01:25:43.777 --> 01:25:45.735
(Nina) Hello?

01:25:47.279 --> 01:25:49.156
What?

01:25:51.031 --> 01:25:53.784
I was just trying to pull... Oh!

01:25:53.824 --> 01:25:56.827
Pull the, uh, loft door down.

01:25:56.869 --> 01:25:59.079
You know, to keep the bats out.

01:25:59.121 --> 01:26:01.497
'Cause once those bats get in the rafters,

01:26:01.538 --> 01:26:05.167
then you can't hardly get 'em out.

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:08.169
And that's when he fell.

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:11.170
Right. That's when I fell.

01:26:11.922 --> 01:26:14.882
It was just dumb.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

01:26:14.967 --> 01:26:18.385
- Let's try this again, Einar.
- Hmm? Oh, Jesus, no...

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:26.642
I hit the gearshift.

01:26:28.768 --> 01:26:31.562
- I didn't mean to.
- It wasn't your fault.

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:35.232
It was an accident.

01:26:41.193 --> 01:26:44.612
You did everything just right tonight.

01:26:44.695 --> 01:26:47.072
As well as your dad could have done.

01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:13.592
(horse whinnies)

01:27:48.491 --> 01:27:51.744
I guess God kept me alive
to bring her into the world.

01:27:52.996 --> 01:27:55.120
But every day, I wish...

01:27:55.956 --> 01:28:00.417
I wish it was me that died
in that car instead of Griffin.

01:28:04.546 --> 01:28:06.963
I wish you both had lived.

01:28:16.472 --> 01:28:20.973
I was fallen-down drunk
the night that Mitch got mauled.

01:28:21.932 --> 01:28:26.228
That's why I couldn't get
the bear off him before I did.

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:31.147
He never said anything about it.

01:28:31.230 --> 01:28:33.274
He never would.

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:47.366
You.

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.546
I'm not just gonna lie down here.

01:29:04.547 --> 01:29:06.171
(bear roars)

01:29:23.143 --> 01:29:25.730
Just keep going.

01:29:53.123 --> 01:29:55.667
Heard you made a hell of a fall, Einar.

01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:58.460
You're lucky you only cracked two ribs.

01:29:58.543 --> 01:30:01.003
It was the soft part of the yard.

01:30:02.255 --> 01:30:03.588
- Am I finished?
- Not yet.

01:30:03.672 --> 01:30:07.551
I'm going to keep you here for a little bit,
make sure your spleen's OK.

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.468
Ah, I'm fine.

01:30:09.552 --> 01:30:12.721
Well, I'll check back on you this afternoon.

01:30:12.804 --> 01:30:15.430
So you can double-bill me?

01:30:15.514 --> 01:30:18.517
Seems fair to me.
You are twice the trouble.

01:30:18.558 --> 01:30:21.143
Let's give it a day or two, OK?

01:30:21.227 --> 01:30:23.105
Hmm.

01:30:23.188 --> 01:30:25.814
Couple of days.
That's bullshit.

01:30:28.316 --> 01:30:30.192
(Jean giggles)

01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:55.376
Einar?

01:30:56.168 --> 01:30:57.211
OK?

01:30:57.253 --> 01:31:00.380
Yeah, I'm fine. Got clumsy.

01:31:00.463 --> 01:31:02.339
Mitch.

01:31:03.467 --> 01:31:05.968
Mitch, we set the bear free.

01:31:08.595 --> 01:31:10.472
I know.

01:31:11.429 --> 01:31:13.347
Thank you.

01:31:25.482 --> 01:31:28.400
You want me to run
some breakfast out to Mitch?

01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:32.570
No. Usually coffee's enough
for him in the morning.

01:31:34.862 --> 01:31:36.947
You know,

01:31:37.032 --> 01:31:38.948
she could go to school here.

01:31:41.119 --> 01:31:43.204
Not a bad school.

01:32:16.477 --> 01:32:18.395
Whoa, Jimmy.

01:33:08.307 --> 01:33:10.226
Stay there.

01:33:12.392 --> 01:33:16.728
- What do you want, Gary?
- It's time to come home, baby.

01:33:21.024 --> 01:33:23.108
I love you, Jean.

01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:26.654
You love me?

01:33:28.988 --> 01:33:32.448
- That's what your love feels like.
- You bitch!

01:33:32.532 --> 01:33:34.409
- Mom!
- Don't you ever hit me!

01:33:34.491 --> 01:33:36.532
- Mom!
- Don't you hit me!

01:33:36.574 --> 01:33:39.412
- Mom, are you OK? Mom! Mom!
- Come on.

01:33:39.453 --> 01:33:42.455
- Mom! Mom!
- Let her go, Gary!

01:33:42.496 --> 01:33:44.917
- Let go of me.
- Are you coming or staying?

01:33:44.957 --> 01:33:47.208
Hey! Take your hands off her!

01:33:47.293 --> 01:33:49.669
- What the hell?
- (gunshot)

01:33:50.795 --> 01:33:53.131
Get in the car.
Get in there!

01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:56.966
Griff, get out of the car.

01:33:57.049 --> 01:33:59.302
- Griff! Griff, goddamnit!
- (Jean) Griff!

01:33:59.385 --> 01:34:01.304
Mom!

01:34:01.387 --> 01:34:03.429
- Mom!
- (engine fails to start)

01:34:08.516 --> 01:34:10.435
Come on.

01:34:14.478 --> 01:34:15.813
Mom.

01:34:16.731 --> 01:34:18.858
- Come on.
- Mom.

01:34:23.817 --> 01:34:26.571
- It's enough, Einar.
- Mom.

01:34:49.795 --> 01:34:53.132
(Einar) You leave her alone.
Now, come on here. Come on, get.

01:34:53.215 --> 01:34:55.883
Get out of here. Get away,
you greedy little bugger.

01:34:55.925 --> 01:35:00.053
- She didn't do anything to you.
- That's Mitchell. He's a boy.

01:35:02.222 --> 01:35:03.847
Yep.

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:07.434
Come on.

01:35:07.517 --> 01:35:09.851
Get outta... Goddamn...

01:35:11.436 --> 01:35:14.271
(bus driver) Loma.
Loma, Nebraska.

01:35:36.704 --> 01:35:40.415
So what about you, Mitch?
You know anything about this?

01:35:40.498 --> 01:35:42.584
About what?

01:35:44.335 --> 01:35:47.545
So you don't know anything about it?

01:35:47.586 --> 01:35:49.797
I just drove him home from the hospital.

01:35:49.838 --> 01:35:52.008
Mm-hm. Of course. Right.

01:35:52.049 --> 01:35:53.968
Hello, Officer Curtis.

01:35:54.051 --> 01:35:56.469
Good afternoon there, Griff.

01:35:57.178 --> 01:35:58.929
Einar.

01:35:59.013 --> 01:36:01.347
Would you stay for lunch today?

01:36:01.431 --> 01:36:03.392
Yeah, I might.

01:36:03.474 --> 01:36:08.520
I gotta speak to your grandfather
for a second, though, first.

01:36:11.355 --> 01:36:15.273
Ah, heck. It can wait.
Here, let me grab that for you.

01:36:15.356 --> 01:36:17.359
So, how was she today?
Looks good, huh?

01:36:17.401 --> 01:36:20.777
- Yeah? Did you do the milking?
- Yeah.

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:26.365
Think it might rain today.

01:36:29.159 --> 01:36:31.453
No, it's gonna stay warm.

01:36:31.537 --> 01:36:36.832
I didn't say anything about the
temperature. I said it might rain.

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:43.586
Would you bury me next to Griffin?

01:36:47.589 --> 01:36:50.591
Don't you think you oughta die first?

01:36:52.842 --> 01:36:55.304
It's gonna happen, you know.

01:36:55.387 --> 01:37:01.056
Where the hell else do you think
I'd bury you? It's where my family lies.

01:37:03.268 --> 01:37:07.435
You think the dead
really care about our lives?

01:37:07.519 --> 01:37:10.229
(Mitch) Yeah, I think they do.

01:37:10.272 --> 01:37:12.899
I think they forgive us our sins.

01:37:14.775 --> 01:37:17.277
I even think it's easy for them.

01:37:20.112 --> 01:37:23.574
(Einar) Griff said you had
a dream about flying.

01:37:23.657 --> 01:37:25.573
Yeah.

01:37:26.534 --> 01:37:28.454
I got so high, Einar,

01:37:28.535 --> 01:37:31.788
I could see where the blue turns to black.

01:37:32.954 --> 01:37:36.208
From up there, you could see all there is.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.254
And it looked like there was
a reason for everything.
