00:21.922 --> 00:23.391
Rope.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.625
Check.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.026
Cutting blades.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.062
- Check.
- Gasoline.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.097
I got it.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.664
Please, say "check"

00:30.664 --> 00:31.832
so I don't get confused.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.000
Fine, Bob. Check.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.335
No problem. I got this.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.936
- No problem.
- Hey, Warren.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.474
I can't do it, Bobby.
I'm scared.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.609
So am I.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.311
But you know
what really scares me?

00:43.311 --> 00:44.512
- What?
- Is never being able

00:44.512 --> 00:46.046
to play music
with you guys again.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.215
Damn right, brother.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.249
What's the status, Dee Dee?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.450
Six blocks away.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.884
Okay, you ready
to blow it up?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.386
Ah, this is gonna
be beautiful.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.916
We're sold out for months.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.518
Everybody loves bubbles.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.621
Sure. But doesn't
booking out the hall

01:27.621 --> 01:29.223
- send a negative message?
- No.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.824
It says that
we're all committed

01:30.824 --> 01:32.160
so finding a solution

01:32.160 --> 01:33.694
and getting the players
back playing.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.962
In the meantime,

01:34.962 --> 01:36.464
having our halls
filled with bubbles

01:36.464 --> 01:38.031
is better than having
it filled with nothing.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.333
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:39.333 --> 01:40.701
- What do we want?
- Respect!

01:40.701 --> 01:42.170
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:42.170 --> 01:43.571
- This is ridiculous.
- Respect!

01:43.571 --> 01:45.173
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:45.173 --> 01:46.307
- What do we want?
- Respect!

01:46.307 --> 01:47.775
- When do we want it?
- Now!

01:47.775 --> 01:50.077
Thank you for coming.
Did you have a good time?

01:50.077 --> 01:51.879
Good. What the hell
are you doing?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.182
So this is what it takes
to get a face-to-face
conversation.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.949
Our lawyers made you
a counteroffer.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.318
Yours have not responded.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.253
It wasn't an offer.
It was a joke.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.554
You've been stalling
for a month,

02:00.554 --> 02:02.055
and now you've put
bubbles into our house?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.325
- Boo!
- Lily, I'm so sorry.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.926
Do you want to go
inside and relax?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.027
I'm fine right here.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.461
Ha ha. She's fine.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.199
Okay, look, why don't we
just move down the street

02:11.199 --> 02:12.833
away from these
lovely folks?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.302
You're all scabs!

02:14.302 --> 02:16.237
Now. Now. I want you
out of here right now.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.372
That's how it works in your
world, right, Gloria?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.208
You want something gone?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.075
Fair wages, health insurance.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.378
Move down the street,
or I'll call the police

02:24.378 --> 02:25.679
and have you politely
removed.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.381
So call them.
Call the police.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.550
She just wants us to take
a few steps back there.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.219
And take that rat
with you.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.621
That rat is not just a rat.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.989
It's a symbol of--
of our solidarity--

02:35.989 --> 02:37.725
- Right.
- ...with the labor and--

02:37.725 --> 02:39.427
No. Pavel, no!

02:39.427 --> 02:41.429
No, no!
It's a rental!

02:41.429 --> 02:42.430
Don't touch our--

02:43.531 --> 02:44.765
I thought you were
with us, Pavel!

02:44.765 --> 02:47.535
Yes, but not with
these things you do!

02:47.535 --> 02:48.902
When do we want it? Now!

02:48.902 --> 02:50.871
You have some tape?
We can save--

02:52.740 --> 02:55.576
You're not going to make it.
You've got to let it go.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.647
Girl.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.750
- Girl!
- What?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.753
Luggage.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.271
Wow.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.548
Hello.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.733
Oh, my God.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.934
I am so sorry.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.304
I didn't mean
to intrude at all.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.606
I asked
if you were here,

03:58.606 --> 04:00.173
but I didn't
hear anything,

04:00.173 --> 04:01.709
and I was just looking.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.778
Your house
is very beautiful,

04:04.778 --> 04:09.149
and I was
taking a tour of it.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.318
Rest.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.219
No, uh, I'm--
I'm really good.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.821
I actually slept
a lot last night.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.623
It's, like, 1:00
or something, so--

04:15.623 --> 04:18.459
No. Vocal rest.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.327
- Oh.
- No talk.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.863
Okay. You got it.
No talk.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.533
Is Rodrigo here?

04:29.837 --> 04:32.105
Do you want me
to come with you?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.709
Hey, do you think you could
tell me the WiFi password?

04:35.709 --> 04:38.679
Because, um, I just need
to rebook my flight home,

04:38.679 --> 04:41.715
and then I could
be out of your way.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.484
No internet.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.686
No internet.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.788
Okay. Cool.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.628
Yeah, I was supposed
to leave, uh, for Moscow

04:54.628 --> 04:56.364
in, like, three weeks.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.132
Shit. I can't believe
I got fired.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.369
What is waiting
for you at home?

05:01.369 --> 05:03.036
Uh...

05:03.036 --> 05:05.272
nothing, really.

05:05.272 --> 05:08.576
So you're free.
I'm jealous.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.379
Well, kind of.
I'm free and broke.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.480
Is--

05:13.414 --> 05:14.948
Is this clams?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.551
When something
makes us scared,

05:17.551 --> 05:20.153
must face it again
right away.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.689
Is that an Italian thing?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.924
This is what my mother
used to say.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.560
But you know
what happened to her.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.861
No. What happened to her?

05:27.861 --> 05:29.129
Oh, my God.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.964
I'm so sorry.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.199
Eat the clams.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.101
I don't think
that's a good idea.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.504
Do you think I should
sing the concert?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.606
I was not sure.

05:38.606 --> 05:42.410
Yes, you should definitely,
definitely sing the concert.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.846
I will sing
if you eat the clams.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.814
Huh.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.148
Wait. Really?

05:48.148 --> 05:49.950
No clams, no concert.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.120
Okay.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.125
Ohh.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.865
Ohh.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.267
How did you become
the maestro's lover?

06:07.267 --> 06:09.269
Oh, no, no.
We're not lovers.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.038
We're just friends.
I mean, kind of.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.339
We're kind of friends.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.774
Did he say
something to you?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.043
Because, I mean,
his grandmother,

06:16.043 --> 06:19.880
she did say that we were
going to have kids,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.982
but she was also
reading coffee grounds,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.784
so I don't think
that's very reliable.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.287
Epa. Hey, the two of you
in one room. Okay.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.789
- Oh, wow.
- Yep.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.492
Hai Lai,
look what I got you.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.594
I'm going to make you
a tea for the stomach.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.928
My grandmother
used to do this.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.364
Oh, we were just talking
about your grandmother,

06:37.364 --> 06:41.835
but actually La Fiamma just--
just made me eat clams again,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.738
and that's actually making
me feel a lot better.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.041
Uh, I will dress
for rehearsal.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.143
Si. Claro.
Si, rehearsal.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.157
Hai Lai. What's up?

07:04.157 --> 07:05.493
I thought you were dead.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.260
Yeah, I know. I also
thought I was dead.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.496
Yeah?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.898
I should have
listened to you

07:10.898 --> 07:12.500
about Walsh.
You were right.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.935
Ah. Well, no. You should
only listen to yourself.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.404
That's your only job,
really, as an artist.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.039
Even if you're
completely wrong,

07:19.039 --> 07:21.008
that's what an artist does,
listen to one's self.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.276
Hey, what are you doing here?
Everyone in New York said

07:23.276 --> 07:24.578
that you'd
fallen off the map.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.246
Well, yeah. They took
me off the map.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.515
Didn't they? Right?

07:27.515 --> 07:31.084
I'm doing opera.
For La Fiamma.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.520
Oh.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.688
Are you living here?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.657
I moved in, yes.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.626
Me-- We can rehearse.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.528
We can do music, you know?

07:40.528 --> 07:41.795
We don't talk about meetings

07:41.795 --> 07:43.564
or "A ten minute
break, maestro."

07:43.564 --> 07:45.265
None of that here.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.400
No, no. Mm-mm. No, no.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.536
What?

07:48.536 --> 07:49.637
Nothing.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.172
What, Hai Lai?

07:53.941 --> 07:54.842
Uh, what!

07:54.842 --> 07:56.644
Uh, it's just in the park,

07:56.644 --> 07:59.179
you said that the orchestra
was your home.

08:00.848 --> 08:04.384
Okay. I just feel like
everyone's kind of waiting

08:04.384 --> 08:05.653
for you to come back.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.996
Ah, sí, sí, sí.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.301
He's like a child.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.571
Yeah. He is.

08:23.571 --> 08:26.574
Okay.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.677
Did you go to school here?

08:29.677 --> 08:32.179
No. They rejected me,
you see?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.446
Really?

08:33.446 --> 08:35.616
But I wanted to observe
the teachings,

08:35.616 --> 08:38.586
so I took a job as, uh--
how you say in English?

08:38.586 --> 08:40.053
to clean the floors.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.254
Like a janitor?

08:41.254 --> 08:44.024
Ah. Maybe that would be
a better nickname for me

08:44.024 --> 08:47.227
instead of La Fiamma.
The Janitor.

08:52.232 --> 08:56.369
Uh io...io solo canto.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.838
Anch'io.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.106
She will show you.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.208
Okay. Thanks.
Hey.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.610
Ah. Alessandra.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.145
Hey. Hey, I want you
to meet someone.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.880
Come, come. Nico.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.449
Hi. It's so good
to meet you.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.751
Thank you so much
for coming.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.852
Piacere, Nico.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.687
He's my friend Nico Mulli.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.423
He's about to premiere
an opera in New York,

09:16.423 --> 09:18.158
and there is an aria there

09:18.158 --> 09:20.761
that we would love
for you to do.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.362
How wonderful.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.531
And what's
the character?

09:24.531 --> 09:26.099
So the character's
a young American woman

09:26.099 --> 09:27.200
named Amy Fisher,

09:27.200 --> 09:28.869
and she is having an affair
with an older man,

09:28.869 --> 09:30.503
an she goes over to his house

09:30.503 --> 09:32.039
and shoots his wife
in the head,

09:32.039 --> 09:34.007
and his name
is Joey Buttafuoco.

09:34.007 --> 09:34.942
Buttafuoco?

09:34.942 --> 09:39.647
Baghdad, Budapest
to how? How?

09:39.647 --> 09:41.048
Girl?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.515
Yes. Hello.

09:42.515 --> 09:43.917
Who are you?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.318
Yeah, I'm Hailey Rutledge.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.656
I play the oboe. I'm just
here with the maestro,

09:48.656 --> 09:50.257
uh, just using the WiFi--

09:50.257 --> 09:55.228
So you are with the maestro,
and, uh, he is with you.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.398
No. No, no. I'm just here
with the maestro.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.600
- Common mistake.
- Please, of course.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.702
It's understood.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.208
You have done me
a fantastic service.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.342
Molti grazie.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.410
Molti grazie.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.045
Okay, de nada.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.180
What?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.627
So this is what you'd
be singing, this line,

10:27.627 --> 10:29.496
then the rest of it
is all going to be made

10:29.496 --> 10:31.231
by sort of prerecorded sounds

10:31.231 --> 10:33.000
and then you singing
all these numbers

10:33.000 --> 10:35.602
and little pieces of fragmented
text into the microphone

10:35.602 --> 10:37.504
that you're going to repeat
with your foot pedal.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.806
Foot pedal?

10:38.806 --> 10:39.973
You wouldn't have to
use the foot pedal.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.775
Someone else could
use the foot pedal.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.376
I'll do the pedal.
Let me do the pedal.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.477
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.046
And what does
the orchestra play?

10:46.046 --> 10:48.015
The orchestra does nothing.
They just sit there

10:48.015 --> 10:49.349
because the whole thing
is about you,

10:49.349 --> 10:50.884
what's happening
inside your head,

10:50.884 --> 10:52.552
and how that's reflected
in the counting,

10:52.552 --> 10:54.755
the repeated numbers,
the obsessive rhythms.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.389
- Basically.
- It's all in your head--

10:56.389 --> 10:58.258
all the numbers and the little
things you're thinking,

10:58.258 --> 10:59.827
and the audience
is listening to you

10:59.827 --> 11:01.261
and your humble pedal.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.196
So what do you think?

11:07.400 --> 11:08.769
J'adore.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.203
Mm-hmm.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.371
I adore.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.806
The combination of sounds,

11:12.806 --> 11:14.041
technologies,

11:14.041 --> 11:16.744
the voices, the counting,

11:16.744 --> 11:18.178
16, 17.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.213
Ah, it's going to be such
a grand finale, you know?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.015
And people
are going to go crazy.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.316
They're going to go wild.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.753
But I don't
understand it at all.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.420
If Amy Fisher
was his wife,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.322
then bang, yes.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.225
But she's
the Buttafuoco's lover.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.795
Why does the lover
shoot the wife?

11:35.963 --> 11:39.132
Maybe you should
change the story.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.467
Yeah, man.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.802
Uh, I never--

11:41.802 --> 11:43.336
I hadn't thought
about changing it

11:43.336 --> 11:44.637
because it-- well, you know
it's actually based

11:44.637 --> 11:45.973
on a real thing
that happened--

11:45.973 --> 11:47.140
Amy Fisher's real?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.776
Amy Fisher's
completely real.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.077
I don't believe it.
It's a myth.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.444
Alessandra, I think
you should do this.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.046
I want to make you happy.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.783
I like the robot sounds.

11:55.783 --> 11:59.987
But I cannot sing
what I do not feel.

11:59.987 --> 12:04.091
This American girl in love
with this older man,

12:04.091 --> 12:06.693
so desperate
and life so empty

12:06.693 --> 12:07.861
that she will do anything

12:07.861 --> 12:09.462
to be near him.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.098
How can I understand her?

12:11.098 --> 12:14.567
Well, the good news is
I got a flight tomorrow,

12:14.567 --> 12:15.869
but the bad news is

12:15.869 --> 12:17.971
it goes through Estonia
and then Houston

12:17.971 --> 12:19.172
and then New York.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.641
My darling, I'm so
happy to see you,

12:21.641 --> 12:22.810
and we all are.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.911
- Hai Lai.
- Hi.

12:23.911 --> 12:24.945
Hi.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.179
Would you come with me

12:26.179 --> 12:27.480
this afternoon
to my fitting?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.817
- To your costume fitting?
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.119
And, Maestro, you must
go and find a place

12:32.119 --> 12:34.988
for me to sing
out of the cage.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.825
Hmm. Out of the cage.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.192
We will.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.261
We will.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.149
What was that?

13:42.422 --> 13:43.390
What?

13:46.059 --> 13:47.294
What was that?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.647
Oh, my God.
Okay, he's here.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.216
Uh, there's no receptionist.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.683
Nobody around. I can't--

14:10.683 --> 14:11.919
Hey, can you
just say something

14:11.919 --> 14:13.921
to prove that--
that you are you

14:13.921 --> 14:15.555
and that this is real?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.823
Are you eraseface?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.225
Yeah. Danny.
You can call me Danny.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.292
Oh, thank God for that.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.962
Hello.
This is Thomas Pembrige

14:21.962 --> 14:26.133
speaking to you from,
um, Studio B, Brooklyn.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.102
Danny and I are about
to collaborate

14:29.102 --> 14:31.972
on a piece of work--
original, I hope--

14:31.972 --> 14:34.674
and I'm looking forward to it.
Who am I talking to?

14:34.674 --> 14:36.343
It's my mom. She loves you.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.279
Oh, really?
Well, give her my love.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.048
Uh, he, uh,
he sends his love.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.515
- I think she's crying.
- Really?

14:42.515 --> 14:44.284
Okay. I'll talk
to you later. Bye.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.585
Hmm.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.220
Dude, thank you so much.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.421
You have no idea how much
that means to her.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.423
She's, like,
such a big fan of yours.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.492
She saw you do Mahler's
Sixth in San Francisco,

14:52.492 --> 14:55.028
and she was, like, a
fundamentally different
person after--

14:55.028 --> 14:56.997
like, kind of
strangely different.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.432
Well, let's, uh--
shall we get down to it?

14:59.432 --> 15:00.867
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Now, look, I don't know

15:00.867 --> 15:02.002
how you want
to proceed here.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.170
I set up a piano for you.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.537
I've got
an invention here,

15:04.537 --> 15:05.638
a fugue there.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.774
Would you mind if I show
you what I have first?

15:07.774 --> 15:09.109
No, not at all.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.429
That's
my washing machine.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.107
I knew this was a mistake.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.243
Oh, uh, yeah. I mean, we can
work on something else.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.445
I still have so much
mixing to do on that one.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.314
It's-- I mean,
it's way too rough.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.650
Too rough? My cat's
tongue is way too rough.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.652
But this-- this thing?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.021
This is a hop, skip,

15:54.021 --> 15:56.289
and a fucking jump
through Robocop's anus,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.258
and you know it.
I mean, what is it?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.760
You want me to play
some cliché'd bullshit

16:00.760 --> 16:02.629
classical stuff
to put on top?

16:02.629 --> 16:03.730
Do you want this crap?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.302
- No, no.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.171
Yes. That's terrible.
Please, don't do that.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.939
- So what do you want?
- Okay.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.108
The Martians have landed.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.078
Introduce them
to Thomas Pembridge.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.713
How do you do that?

16:20.713 --> 16:22.449
The Martians?

16:25.185 --> 16:28.588
Okay. I think I get it.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.622
Um--

16:34.461 --> 16:37.097
Yeah. No. Yeah.
That's really--

16:37.097 --> 16:38.231
- Hmm.
- ...good.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.932
Um, no,
can you do, uh,

16:39.932 --> 16:41.501
just the top voice?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.969
Just the right hand,
please.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.904
Oh.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.642
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, right now,
uh, just do that again,

16:49.642 --> 16:50.943
but do it one octave up.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.445
- Yeah?
- One octave.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.680
Yeah,
just one octave higher.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.547
Good. Tell me when.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.116
- Yeah, now.
- All right.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.088
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's it, that's it.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.122
- Hold on.
- Wait a minute.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.256
Wait. That's it.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.223
What do you mean?
That's it?

17:04.223 --> 17:05.758
That's what I need.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.859
And now we give it
to the orchestra. Look.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.121
Oh, yeah.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.423
Oh, yeah.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.957
I love it.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.292
I love it.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.361
It's fucking great!

17:41.361 --> 17:43.630
Yee-ha! Yeah! Well done.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.132
Do that again.
Do that again.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.566
- Do what?
- Do the "Yee-ha," dude.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.501
- Uh, make some noise.
- Yee-ha!

17:48.501 --> 17:49.836
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

17:49.836 --> 17:52.339
Welcome to the world,
you motherfuckers!

17:52.339 --> 17:53.740
You've got to come.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.974
He wants me to go to Venice

17:54.974 --> 17:56.276
to perform the damn thing.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.710
And the turbot
for the lady.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.879
If I could just scoot
your calculator over.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.449
Yeah. Sorry.
We're on the clock.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.152
You know, I'm going to have
to start making reservations

18:05.152 --> 18:06.619
you, me,

18:06.619 --> 18:09.622
and the calculator
monster there.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.958
Please. If anyone
sees us, it's a--

18:11.958 --> 18:13.293
it's a perfect cover.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.561
We're working
on the budget.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.763
Darling,
don't be so paranoid.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.599
We live in a city
of 9 million people.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.368
I mean,
what are the chances--

18:21.368 --> 18:23.636
Oh, I don't believe it.
Hi, Bunny.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.538
- Oh, Bunny.
- Thomas.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.340
We missed you
at the ballet benefit.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.508
- Oh.
- Beautiful.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.243
I cried
through the Giselle.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.078
Claire would have
loved it.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.381
Mm, actually, she didn't
like the ballet.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.783
But she did love to weep.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.017
Ha ha!

18:38.017 --> 18:39.686
We're just burning
the midnight oil--

18:39.686 --> 18:41.221
- Mm-hmm.
- ...at this work dinner.

18:41.221 --> 18:44.224
Just running the numbers
on the annual gifts.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.592
Work, work, work.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.927
Speaking of which,

18:47.927 --> 18:50.930
I haven't received a check
from you this season.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.999
Who would I
be giving money to?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.734
The bubble people?

18:54.734 --> 18:56.903
- See you on
the way out, Gloria.
- Oh, yeah?

18:56.903 --> 18:59.239
I'm going
to the ladies' room.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.208
- Ooh.
- Follow me, but be discreet.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.209
Good idea.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.645
My God, that's amazing.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.248
- Mm.
- What are you doing?

19:08.248 --> 19:09.316
Mm.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.650
Oh. Well, I--

19:10.650 --> 19:12.419
I think it's your phone
somewhere vibrating.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.321
- Oh.
- Oh.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.689
Yes, yes. This is she.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.491
What can I do for--

19:18.491 --> 19:19.492
Ohh!

19:19.492 --> 19:21.494
- Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.
- Mr. Mayor?

19:21.494 --> 19:24.331
Hailey, about Amy Fisher,

19:24.331 --> 19:26.466
why she shot Mary Jo?

19:26.466 --> 19:30.237
I would shot
Buttafuoco instead.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.539
Yeah. I guess. Same.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.507
I honestly don't
really know, though.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.942
You don't know the story?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.678
Uh, no. I think it kind
of happened, like--

19:38.678 --> 19:40.480
- Tell me something.
- Yeah.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.915
Have you ever wanted
to shoot someone?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.353
No. No.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.754
Even just for a moment.

19:47.754 --> 19:48.855
Uh...

19:48.855 --> 19:51.157
yeah, well, maybe my
eighth grade oboe teacher.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.260
He was kind of gropey.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.062
Would you ever shot him
in the head or the heart?

19:56.062 --> 19:59.165
Uh, I think lower.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.700
Lower? Me, too.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.304
But not Amy Fisher.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.839
Not Mary Fisher--
Amy Fisher.

20:09.242 --> 20:12.312
Signore, La Fiamma!
La Fiamma!

20:12.312 --> 20:13.846
Francesca.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.850
- Lionel.
- Alessandra.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.892
Oh, my God. Okay.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.594
Oh. Don't worry.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.929
That crocodile
doesn't bite.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.835
- The girl's killing death.
- Oh.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.042
- Prego.
- No. Grazie.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.577
- Thank you.
- Ah, you must.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.212
Francesca makes
the limoncello herself

20:46.212 --> 20:47.547
in her bathroom.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.383
Oh. Okay.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.951
- Salute.
- Salute.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.855
Ooh. That's really good.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.727
Salute.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.894
Grazie.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.054
- Hailey.
- Mm.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.255
- Yeah.
- Come here.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.423
You'll be my dresser.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.458
I'll be your what?

21:33.192 --> 21:36.496
Shh.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.999
Stay just
for the Festival.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.869
You help me, we'll
talk about Amy Fisher,

21:42.869 --> 21:44.604
and then I'll get you
a proper ticket

21:44.604 --> 21:46.005
to New York
or some place better.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.941
I just really don't know
that much about Amy Fisher

21:48.941 --> 21:50.377
and, like, clothes or--

21:50.377 --> 21:52.879
It's just a few dresses
for a concert.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.180
Please.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.582
Come.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.586
If you'll stay,

21:59.586 --> 22:02.054
it makes me feel the solo.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.290
Oh.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.426
You'll stay?

22:06.426 --> 22:10.463
Okay. Okay.
Uh, it's fine.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.698
- Lionel.
- Hmm?

22:11.698 --> 22:13.600
She needs to see
all the costumes.

22:14.701 --> 22:18.237
So Francesca
is Alessandra.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.473
Stefano is you.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.208
The diva,

22:22.208 --> 22:24.276
she finish, and then--

22:31.083 --> 22:32.985
But when you do it,

22:32.985 --> 22:35.755
it must be
completely silent.

22:35.755 --> 22:36.456
Okay.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.590
And take half the time.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.925
Lionel.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.427
Oh.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.877
- Hailey.
- Yeah.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.446
Tell him who is Amy Fisher.

22:59.446 --> 23:02.982
Uh, okay. Well, um...

23:02.982 --> 23:04.984
she's from Long Island.

23:04.984 --> 23:09.856
She's a girl, and she was
in love with a man,

23:09.856 --> 23:11.658
an, um,

23:11.658 --> 23:13.826
she shot his wife
in the face.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.919
Alessandra?

23:45.558 --> 23:46.993
- Joey.
- Aah!

23:48.495 --> 23:50.196
Joey Buttafuoco.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.999
Why you want
to go home

23:52.999 --> 23:54.834
and leave me alone?

23:54.834 --> 23:58.505
Look at me. Why
does it have to end?

23:58.505 --> 24:01.641
Uh, Amy Fisher's actually
a really sad story.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.944
Opera is
supposed to be sad.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.412
So is love.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.848
Hai Lai, look at me.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.752
Rodrigo.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.955
Do you trust me,
Hailey?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.857
Uh, yes.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.961
Why do I
deserve your trust?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.262
Um...

24:23.262 --> 24:26.533
because you're
a really bad liar.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.067
You love me.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.938
I don't know yet.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.775
Hai Lai, I love you.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.212
Hai Lai.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.562
What?

24:59.131 --> 25:00.466
Al telefono.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.271
Grazie. Oh.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.144
- ¿Hóla?
- Oh, thank God, Rodrigo.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.980
I called everyone
I know in Venice.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.616
Ai, chíngame, Gloria.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.585
Why----

25:18.585 --> 25:19.986
Wh-Where are you?
What's going on?

25:19.986 --> 25:22.021
I know you're not
happy with us,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.624
but the mayor called
demanding

25:24.624 --> 25:25.925
you come to a meeting--

25:25.925 --> 25:27.827
What? I--
The mayor and the meeting?

25:27.827 --> 25:29.328
I don't want to talk
about a meeting, Gloria.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.630
I want to talk about
music or football.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.731
What do you want
to talk about?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.733
This is about the music.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.702
We have to show
a united front,

25:35.702 --> 25:37.369
or they might
pull the funding.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.738
Rodrigo, Rodrigo,

25:38.738 --> 25:40.873
you have to come
to this meeting, Rodrigo.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.441
You have to!

25:42.441 --> 25:43.442
- Attenzione.
- Hello?

25:44.510 --> 25:45.778
They will pull the funding.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.213
They'll pull the funding.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.649
- Maestro.
- ¿Qué?

25:49.649 --> 25:50.850
We have unfinished
business.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.384
Alessandra,
yes, we have.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.620
I want to.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.021
I want to as well.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.089
Come hear me
be Amy Fisher.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.159
But later. We got--

26:00.159 --> 26:01.628
For now, let's rehearse.

26:01.628 --> 26:02.695
Oh.
