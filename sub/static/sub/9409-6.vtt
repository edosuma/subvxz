that, Billy? Do you have a problem?

17:39.633 --> 17:41.633
I won't do it.

17:41.633 --> 17:44.433
Is this any way for my number
one camper to be acting?

17:44.433 --> 17:47.133
Camp's over.
Nobody else is gonna die.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.000
Die? Nobody has died here,
Billy. This is a summer camp.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.800
You're a liar!
What about Mike's snakebite,

17:54.200 --> 17:56.467
uh, Sabre eating Roger,
Jay and Colin drowning?

17:56.467 --> 18:00.367
Mike? Jay? Colin? We have
no campers by those names.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.800
Liar! You're a liar!

18:02.800 --> 18:05.100
Calm down, Billy. I think I
know what's going on here.

18:05.533 --> 18:08.367
Larry, do we have any boys
with those names?

18:08.367 --> 18:10.067
- Never heard of 'em.
- George?

18:10.567 --> 18:13.700
- Nope.
- Now, listen to me, Billy.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.700
Sometimes if you get too homesick,

18:16.167 --> 18:18.933
you begin imagining things,
seeing things.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.833
No way.

18:22.833 --> 18:26.300
Put down that weapon, Billy, or
you are gonna be very, very sorry.

18:28.833 --> 18:31.200
- No, I'm not.
- Put it down, Billy!

18:32.567 --> 18:34.867
Now!

18:36.267 --> 18:38.167
[ Screams ]

18:41.600 --> 18:44.967
Congratulations, Billy.
[ Laughs ]

18:44.967 --> 18:47.800
- He passed! Billy passed!
- [ All Cheering ]

18:47.800 --> 18:51.200
Way to go, Billy.
You did great.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.533
Hey, you can all come out now.
He passed.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.033
[ Laughs ]

18:57.033 --> 19:01.533
Mom. Dad. What are you guys
doing here? I think I'm going crazy.

19:01.533 --> 19:04.033
No, you're not, sweetheart.
I knew you'd pass.

19:04.033 --> 19:06.067
Pass what?

19:07.433 --> 19:10.433
Congratulations, Billy.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.433
You passed a very difficult series
of tests, Billy,

19:12.433 --> 19:14.433
and you passed with flying colors.

19:14.933 --> 19:16.433
What are you guys talking about?

19:16.833 --> 19:20.367
This is not a summer camp, Billy.
It's a government testing lab.

19:20.867 --> 19:23.200
What about Jay and Colin?

19:23.200 --> 19:26.200
We were under the canoe
the whole time...

19:26.200 --> 19:28.600
- in an air pocket.
- [ Laughs ]

19:30.100 --> 19:32.800
And Mike? I mean,
that snakebite was nasty.

19:34.300 --> 19:38.333
Rubber snake. Had you going
for a while, didn't I?

19:38.333 --> 19:40.600
- And Roger?
- Hey, Billy.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.033
All in one piece.
[ Laughs ] One piece!

19:46.033 --> 19:48.533
Billy, listen. Your father and
I have been asked to lead...

19:49.033 --> 19:52.033
a key expedition
to a very dangerous place.

19:52.033 --> 19:54.233
We couldn't stand the thought of
being away from you for so long,

19:54.733 --> 19:56.233
but government rules
say we couldn't take you

19:56.233 --> 19:58.233
unless you passed certain tests.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.167
- What tests?
- [ Uncle Al ] For quick thinking.

20:00.167 --> 20:02.667
Like the way you figured out how
to trap that snake.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.100
And for courage.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.833
Going out into the night
while Sabre was on the loose.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.800
Trying to protect your friends.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.167
And trying to save us
from drowning.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.500
And believing in yourself

20:12.500 --> 20:14.000
when the whole camp
was saying you were crazy.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.467
You knew when to follow the
rules and when to break them.

20:16.467 --> 20:20.600
So, everybody was in on this?
Campers, counselors?

20:21.100 --> 20:24.667
We're all actors, Billy,
working at the lab.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.600
You guys were amazing.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.100
So amazing, I'm never settin' foot
in another summer camp again.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.300
- [ All Gasp ]
- [ Growls ]

20:37.767 --> 20:41.633
Say hello to Sabre, Billy.

20:41.633 --> 20:45.033
Show him how it growls, George.

20:45.033 --> 20:48.967
- [ Machine Revving ]
- [ Growls ]

20:51.467 --> 20:55.467
Oh, man.
I thought I was dead meat.

20:55.467 --> 20:57.467
Better go get
your things packed, Billy.

20:57.467 --> 20:58.967
Expedition leaves first thing
in the morning.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.600
- Where we going?
- Very far away. A place called Earth.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.600
Research tells us the aliens

21:04.600 --> 21:07.667
there are pretty dangerous and,
uh, unpredictable.

21:07.667 --> 21:12.167
Hmph. Bet you they're not as
crazy as Larry and Uncle Al.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.167
You never know, Billy.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.167
You never know.
