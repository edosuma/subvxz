12:11.520 --> 12:15.206
(SIGHS) Why don't you guys
relax in the ballroom?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.931
And I'll see if I can
scare up some blankets.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.969
(LAUGHS)

12:20.120 --> 12:21.849
You know, these satellite dishes
are useless

12:22.000 --> 12:24.367
unless hotel porn
makes a comeback.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.363
Lovely as that would be,

12:26.520 --> 12:28.727
hotels would need
to make a comeback first.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.168
I mean, if we're lucky enough,
there's enough circuitry left

12:32.320 --> 12:34.288
that we could reorient
one of these dishes

12:34.480 --> 12:36.926
and get another satellite
going here.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.162
<i>But. . see'?</i>

12:39.360 --> 12:41.840
- Yeah. We're not lucky.
- Great.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.443
- All the way from New York, huh?
- Yeah.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.728
Seems impossible.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.769
(SIGHS)

12:50.920 --> 12:52.445
Um...

12:53.640 --> 12:55.483
For some of us, it was.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.611
You know, we've been
inside this hotel since day one.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.604
- Nobody tried to leave?
- Lots of people.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.804
Some of them escaped.
Some were banished.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.566
Yeah, I thought
they were the lucky ones.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.922
Then they'd always turn back up
a few days later.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.885
Zombies.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.690
After a while,

13:15.840 --> 13:17.649
you just quit trying.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.371
(SIGHS) Well, it makes sense
you stayed.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.647
- You had food and shelter.
- Yeah...

13:23.800 --> 13:26.690
- Will you spot me real quick?
- Yeah.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.562
-(SHUDDERS)
-(THUD)

13:45.760 --> 13:47.728

- Stay here.

(POUNDING CONTINUES)

14:04.120 --> 14:06.805
DANA: Sometimes I thought
I was going insane.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.928
- Gideon's very controlling.
- Huh.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.321
I just wanted to be somewhere
without a ceiling.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.960
You know,
breathe in some fresh air.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.610
Out in an open sky.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.683
It's dead.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.525
See different faces.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.969
Got to tell you, it's, uh...

14:28.120 --> 14:29.770
It's pretty effed up out there.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.649
How do you keep going?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.290
I mean, there must
have been places

14:33.440 --> 14:35.727
for you to stay
along the way.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.043
I promised a friend
I'd get him to California.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.487
Gives me someplace to go.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.371
Someplace to go.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.687
I like the sound of that.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.170

Hey, Murphy? Murphy!

14:58.000 --> 15:01.209
- MAN: Help! Somebody help!
- Goddamnit!

15:01.360 --> 15:03.328
Hey, where'd that shot
come from?

15:03.480 --> 15:04.720
It came from here.
Door's locked.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.970
VASQUEZ: One... (GRUNTS)

15:11.880 --> 15:13.882
Murphy-

15:17.920 --> 15:20.127
- Easy, easy.
- Looks like he's still alive.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.850
- He's bleeding bad.
- Yeah.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.843
Greg's been shot.
God, right in the heart.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.002
- He should be dead, man.
-lGGY: What happened?

15:26.160 --> 15:28.367
Iggy, get the door.
We're gonna move 'em out to the bar.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.887
There's more light over there.
Danny, get the first aid kit!

15:33.440 --> 15:35.169
- ADDY: Warren!
- GIDEON: Hurry!

15:35.320 --> 15:37.971
- DANA: They're in here!
-10K, make sure nobody leaves.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.889
- Addy, cover this door.
- I got him.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.411
- Who put you in charge?
- I did.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.244
I was a cop for 10 years.
This is a crime scene.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.482
- Someone tried to kill our prisoner.
- Prisoner?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.608
- I can't stop the bleeding.
- You need to mercy him.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.644
- Wait. He's not turning.
- Can't mercy before he's dead.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.683
- No time to discuss this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.490
We have to process this
without violence.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.489
We can talk about this later.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.682
What you need to do is
tie up your man and secure him

15:58.840 --> 16:00.842
before he turns
or I will mercy him myself.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.843
- Alright.
- How is he?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.241
Bullet went clean through.
I'm worried about this head wound.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.249
He must have cracked it
when he fell.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.568
He's definitely got a concussion.
Maybe worse.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.286

16:35.240 --> 16:38.210
Dana. We need to interface.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.442
Please don't mercy him
before he's dead.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.881
I won't. I promise.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.001
Unless something unforeseen
happens.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.370
- What do you think?
- Well, I only heard one shot.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.409
So we have one bullet,
two victims.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.608
Judging by the bullet's trajectory,
the shooter was here.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.762
(GUN COCKS, THEN GUNSHOT)

16:57.920 --> 17:01.686
He surprised Murphy,
sees the food, fires once.

17:02.800 --> 17:07.249
The bullet hits Murphy in the shoulder,
continues on,

17:07.400 --> 17:10.449
hits victim number two
in the heart.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.282
Now, wait. Hold on.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.965
You're telling me that
the bullet passed through Murphy

17:16.119 --> 17:17.963
and hit this dude in the heart?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.487
Well, no wonder
he ain't turning.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.643
He's looking
just like Cassandra.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.643
You better keep your eye
on him.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.643
- Damn straight.
- GIDEON: Hey, guys?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.643
(STICK THUMPS)
OK, everybody.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.041
Could I ask you to come in here
and join us in the trust circle?

17:33.040 --> 17:35.611
We're gonna resolve
this conflict peacefully.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.603
Without violence.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.603
Well, that's not gonna be easy.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.525
Considering one of you
just shot one of us.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.126
- Do you have any proof of that?
- OK, listen. Everyone.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.681
Violence can spread
like wildfire.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.287
It just takes one spark to
burn down the bridges of trust

17:51.440 --> 17:53.204
between all of
our fellow human beings.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.445
And once it's started,
fire doesn't care who it burns.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.002
I know that we can resolve
the issues between us.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.004
The issue between us? The...

18:05.400 --> 18:09.564
The issue between us
is that one of you shot Murphy.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.765
Imvume.
You said Murphy was your prisoner.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.447
Maybe he tried to escape
and one of you shot him.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.682
-(GROWLS AND THUMPS)
-(SCREAMS)

18:23.400 --> 18:25.801
OK, Meg. Meg, thank you.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.924
Will you please sit down?

18:30.080 --> 18:32.128
We all have to trust.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.009
MAN: lmvume.

18:40.560 --> 18:45.088
I saw him sneaking around
where the shooting happened.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.966
Imvume.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.451
I saw him there too.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.967
Right after the shot was fired,

18:53.120 --> 18:54.770
he was acting suspicious.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.209
Thank you.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.164
Clearly, there's some unresolved conflict
between you and Murphy.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.810
10K doesn't miss.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.604
Hold on.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.926
If 10K wants something dead,
it's dead.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.050
And he would never
try to kill Murphy.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.482
Kick him in the nuts
a few times, maybe.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.529
But...

19:34.680 --> 19:37.604
...he would never
try to kill him.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.529
You care to defend yourself?

19:49.760 --> 19:51.649
Murphy's not my friend.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.325
He never will be.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.246
I have more than enough reasons
to want to kill him.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.325
And when the time comes,
I will kill him. Happily.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.883
But it's not the time.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.243
Why should we believe you?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.084
VASQUEZ:
'Cause he didn't fire that shot.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.565
One of you did.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.848
My God! Look at all that food.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.843
It's more than
100,000 calories there.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.570
Found this hidden
on top of the cabinet

20:21.720 --> 20:23.051
near where Murphy was shot.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.924
We knew someone
was stealing the food.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.844
But we thought
they were eating it.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.889
Sounds like someone
has a getaway stash.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.321
Murphy must have
stumbled upon it

20:31.480 --> 20:33.050
and got shot.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.243
Well, if it turns out
to be true

20:39.400 --> 20:42.085
that one of us
has been stealing food,

20:42.240 --> 20:44.720
it's our agreed-upon policy...

20:45.720 --> 20:48.929
...that the punishment
is immediate banishment.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.242
Now, there's only one person,

20:51.400 --> 20:54.529
other than myself, who has
access to our food supply.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.802
I didn't do this.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.689
Where were you
when the shots were fired?

21:01.840 --> 21:04.844
- Did anyone see you?
- I didn't steal that food!

21:05.000 --> 21:06.843
Wouldn't be the first time.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.765
That was a few candy bars
more than a year ago.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.888
And I've been
on lowered rations since.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.606
You sure don't look like you've
been on 900 calories a day.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.683

and you've made it clear

21:28.240 --> 21:30.925
for a long time
that you wanted to leave.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.851
I wanted all of us to leave!

Brother, if you want people
to start believing what you say,

21:48.480 --> 21:50.323
you gotta start

- You made your decision for us.
- Don't do this.

Don't do this. Please!

he's the guilty one?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.924
- Where's your proof?
- He knew the consequences.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.923
If you send him out there now,
that's a death sentence.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.889
He'll be killed
and turn for sure.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.441
Oh, OK. Anything else you want
to say before you leave?

what you did, Iggy.

but he still hasn't
regained consciousness.

till the swelling goes down

it could kill him.

That thing about the bullet
passing through Murphy

and hitting this guy in the heart
blew my mind, you know.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.527
Got me thinking -
if that tiny amount of Murphy blood

24:05.680 --> 24:07.523
could keep this guy
from turning,

24:07.680 --> 24:09.523
what would a little bit
more blood do?

But it's the apocalypse.
I figure...go for it, right?

24:14.320 --> 24:17.369
So I've been soaking this rag
in Murphy blood

24:17.520 --> 24:19.602
and letting Greg here
suck on it.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.728
- Doc.
- I know. Bad idea, right?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.723
But check it out.
He's getting better.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.723
His fever broke.
He's breathing normally.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.644
Which, I don't know
how the hell you do that

24:27.800 --> 24:29.643
with a hole in your chest
the size of a silver dollar.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.088
Look at his skin. It's turning
that pretty blue, like Murphy.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.770
Wow, this Murphy shit is real,
isn't it?

24:34.920 --> 24:36.763
Sure looks like it, chief.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.685
Well, keep an eye on...him...

24:39.840 --> 24:41.683
...it...whatever.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.241
- Keep Murphy alive.
- Where you going?

24:44.400 --> 24:46.482

before they banish Iggy.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.324
I know. You called it.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.841
And since when has Dana started
leading popcorn circle?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.525
She never even finished
her master's.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.889

he looks at her.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.367
- Excuse me.
- I know. You called it.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.726
And what about
these new people?

25:24.880 --> 25:27.167
Why are we sharing
anything with them?

25:27.320 --> 25:29.004
Who are they to us?

25:29.160 --> 25:31.128
Iggy paid the price
for that decision.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.567
And he's gone.
But we're still here.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.411
We're going to need
every bite of food they take.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.444
I'm sorry
you had to witness that.

25:41.960 --> 25:43.849
Some people just leave you
no choice, you know?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.480
We've all had to make
tough decisions.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.483
- We make decisions as a group.
- Yeah.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.210
Takes more work,
but then people feel like

25:50.400 --> 25:51.686
they own their outcome.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.842
And Iggy supported
all the policies

25:54.000 --> 25:55.843
that led to his banishment.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.401
Why didn't you all leave
a long time ago?

25:58.560 --> 26:01.040
It was a real horror show.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.083
Half the people
in this hotel died

26:03.240 --> 26:05.242

to keep it under control,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.162

I knew Iggy
had a flawed character,

26:53.040 --> 26:54.883
but I didn't think he had it in him
to shoot someone.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.842
- Thank you.
- Sure.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.922
(YELLS)

38:42.080 --> 38:44.447
They aren't here
to speak for themselves

38:44.600 --> 38:47.490
because you did
all the speaking for them!

38:47.640 --> 38:50.564
(IGGY BREATHES HEAVILY)

38:55.000 --> 38:56.286
(MOANS)

39:01.200 --> 39:03.123
What did I miss?

39:10.080 --> 39:11.764
(SNARLING)

39:11.920 --> 39:14.400
DANA: They're leaving.
The Zs are leaving.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.847
(SNARLING)

39:17.040 --> 39:19.566
I had the craziest dreams.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.411
Thanks again for the food.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.210
Thank you for the freedom.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.330
If you hadn't come along,
we'd still be right where we were,

39:33.480 --> 39:34.845
under Gideon's control.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.764
- Thank you.
- Oh!

39:36.920 --> 39:39.241
- Thank you. Thank you.
- OK.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.687
- Oh, OK.
- Thank you.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.764
Uh, so,
what are you guys gonna do?

39:44.920 --> 39:47.082
Take our chances
out on the road, like you guys.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.288
I've always wanted to see
the Grand Canyon.

39:49.440 --> 39:53.570
Uh, you might wanna...
It ain't what it used to be.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.324
Well, we gotta go.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.845
Good luck.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.650
Yeah, you too.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.121
See ya.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.651
How you feeling, princess?

40:05.840 --> 40:08.844
(MOANS) I have
an apocalyptic headache.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.525
(CHUCKLES)

40:11.560 --> 40:14.325
- ADDY: Hey.
- DANA: Hey.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.802
DANA: I am so sorry.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.008
You did what you had to do.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.084
We all do.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.923
And there's no chance?

40:26.920 --> 40:30.322
Uh...no. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

40:30.480 --> 40:33.324
DANA: Then let's just say
see you later. OK?

40:34.760 --> 40:38.367
I really hope
I see your face again.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.124
ADDY: I'd really like that.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.408
10K: I'm glad I never had
an office job.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.244
Those people were messed up.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.801
-It's the corporations, man.
- Yeah.
