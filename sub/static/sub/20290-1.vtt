01:28.214 --> 01:29.174
Hey bro!

01:31.551 --> 01:32.719
Where are you going?

01:37.932 --> 01:38.892
Shota.

01:40.477 --> 01:41.686
I'm leaving town.

01:42.395 --> 01:43.354
What're you doing?

01:44.731 --> 01:45.690
Hey!

02:02.624 --> 02:04.876
Stop, someone's coming.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.506
Stop!

02:20.183 --> 02:21.893
How long you gonna keep this up?

02:22.602 --> 02:23.770
It's time to stop.

02:29.776 --> 02:30.985
Suit yourself.

03:10.650 --> 03:11.776
Where's Taira?

03:12.527 --> 03:13.528
What about him?

03:13.862 --> 03:14.863
Well...

03:15.321 --> 03:16.906
The Takahama gang was here.

03:18.158 --> 03:19.117
Well...

03:19.868 --> 03:21.369
Can't do anything about him.

03:25.165 --> 03:26.749
You hungry?

03:27.125 --> 03:28.084
Come and eat.

03:29.002 --> 03:30.670
I better go home.

03:31.504 --> 03:33.131
You can stay at my place.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.001
Are you here?

04:55.755 --> 04:57.090
Taira, where are you?

05:30.623 --> 05:35.253
<i>My brother disappeared that day.</i>

05:40.758 --> 05:44.637
<i>He never come back to the place
we stayed at together.</i>

05:46.139 --> 05:49.809
<i>No one seemed to care. To them,
he was nothing but a troublemaker.</i>

05:54.397 --> 05:55.440
<i>I wonder...</i>

05:56.566 --> 05:57.984
<i>where he went...</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:46.777
What the hell?

08:48.821 --> 08:51.032
What was that, you punk?

09:02.502 --> 09:04.754
You little piece of shit.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.551
What the hell, man?

09:40.331 --> 09:41.374
One more.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.294
Let go.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.676
Hey, let go.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.807
Damn it.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.689
Crazy bastard.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.026
You're messed up.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.230
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

10:46.439 --> 10:49.025
How long do you think it'll hurt?

10:49.233 --> 10:50.943
A while, probably.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.987
Well, you know...

10:53.362 --> 10:55.364
- Hey, hey.
- Hold it.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.949
What do you want?

11:01.287 --> 11:02.246
Stop!

11:08.961 --> 11:11.922
Come on. That's enough.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.926
No more, stop.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.224
He looks like shit.

13:27.725 --> 13:30.060
- Crazy.
- I need pictures.

13:30.269 --> 13:31.228
He's eating.

13:32.021 --> 13:34.356
Go on, Yuya. Do it.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.984
Take a picture.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.654
He's so chicken.

13:41.614 --> 13:43.199
Oh my god.

13:43.491 --> 13:45.993
Oh man, that's so gross.

13:46.327 --> 13:47.453
What is?

13:47.453 --> 13:49.246
His face is all swollen.

13:50.331 --> 13:52.166
He's eating a sausage.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.834
Out of the garbage?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.127
He's coming.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.171
Let's teach him a lesson.

13:58.798 --> 14:01.842
- I'll park my bike.
- Make it quick.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.427
Here he comes.

14:04.804 --> 14:07.181
Man, check out his face.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.850
You're hungry?
Eat this.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.686
Eat it, bitch!

14:12.978 --> 14:16.106
Where do you live, huh?
Around here?

14:18.108 --> 14:21.529
God, you smell like shit.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.531
That's hilarious.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.537
Hey, stop it.

14:51.559 --> 14:52.977
Cut it out!

14:56.730 --> 14:58.232
I'll kill you.

15:02.736 --> 15:03.779
Shit.

15:06.532 --> 15:07.825
Yuya!

15:08.409 --> 15:10.035
Get over here!

15:10.703 --> 15:12.329
Yeah, I'm coming.

15:12.913 --> 15:13.914
I'm coming.

15:15.875 --> 15:16.876
Hey.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.921
Hey!
You're... you're overdoing it.

15:21.714 --> 15:23.465
Hey you. Stop.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.101
Hey, you alright?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.186
What is with him?

15:37.605 --> 15:38.772
Are you alright?

15:39.773 --> 15:41.191
Come on, get up.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.239
I told them to stop.

15:47.615 --> 15:49.825
They just wouldn't listen.

15:50.910 --> 15:52.411
You two are really...

15:53.454 --> 15:54.788
naughty boys.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.963
Do something.

16:06.425 --> 16:08.928
Don't just stand there, Yuya.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.558
You worthless prick.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.977
- Go to hell.
- Sorry.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.312
Chicken.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.817
- That was something.
- Shut up.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.792
What's wrong with you?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.046
What the hell?

17:28.507 --> 17:29.633
You moron.

17:29.842 --> 17:33.512
What, you can't even
ride a damn bike?

17:51.071 --> 17:52.740
What do you want?

18:20.684 --> 18:23.395
What the hell is your problem, punk?

18:34.615 --> 18:35.783
What a freak.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.951
- You know him?
- Nope.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.246
Get the hell up.

18:56.095 --> 18:59.807
This really hurts.
Apologize, punk.

19:38.804 --> 19:40.013
That's enough.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.017
Just forget this psycho.

19:52.818 --> 19:53.861
Let's go.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.204
<i>Can I have a cig?</i>

21:19.821 --> 21:22.532
Hey, there he is!

21:22.908 --> 21:24.618
You found him?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.955
Where's Sugawara?

21:28.205 --> 21:29.831
He should be around.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.627
That guy got beat up bad.

21:34.586 --> 21:35.629
I'll call Sugawara.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.631
Nah, I can handle him.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.093
I'm fine on my own.

21:42.511 --> 21:43.470
Just you?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.351
Scumbag.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.148
Where's my damn bike?

22:02.739 --> 22:04.574
We just found him.

22:04.908 --> 22:07.577
Kaneda's fighting him by himself.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.496
Where the hell are you?

22:10.289 --> 22:12.207
This guy is totally finished.

22:12.624 --> 22:13.875
We're done.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.257
Get off me, animal.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.386
He's getting his ass kicked.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.722
Get over here!

22:27.556 --> 22:30.017
<i>I dunno, somewhere on
Main Street Arcade.</i>

22:41.069 --> 22:42.487
Move, moron.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.449
You still messing around, asshole?

22:59.338 --> 23:00.422
You bastard.

23:00.589 --> 23:01.590
Beggar.

23:02.758 --> 23:05.260
- Come on, that's enough.
- Why?

23:05.594 --> 23:07.929
Let go. Get off me.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.807
- You'll kill him.
- I said, let go.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.309
Leave him.

23:12.517 --> 23:15.604
What? You afraid?

23:17.189 --> 23:18.982
I can't believe you.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.377
It's summer break.
Let's go somewhere.

25:03.128 --> 25:04.421
Where can we go?

25:04.754 --> 25:05.797
Let's get a tan.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.425
I'm gonna die in the heat.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.978
They're doing the festival again this year.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.104
Want a drink?

25:21.646 --> 25:23.732
- Nah.
- Come on, I'm buying.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.444
Do you have a towel?

25:28.320 --> 25:31.615
- No.
- Come on, I really need one.

25:31.990 --> 25:35.994
<i>Autumn Festival at Itsukushima Shrine
Battle of the portable shrines</i>

25:36.661 --> 25:38.955
Shit, it's getting cloudy.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.625
You can still get a tan.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.628
I want it to look good.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.464
Nobody's here.

25:55.347 --> 25:58.308
You should carry the portable shrine
at the festival.

25:58.767 --> 25:59.976
I'll pass..

26:00.644 --> 26:01.811
We're too young.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.480
Don't be so uptight.

26:03.772 --> 26:05.273
It's like a war.

26:05.482 --> 26:08.610
The cops don't even care
if someone dies during the festival.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.488
- That can't be right.
- You're a goody.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.949
Stupid. That's how it is.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.284
I'm not going.

26:16.451 --> 26:19.496
Did Mr. Kondo say something to you?

26:19.704 --> 26:20.830
That's not it.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.124
I can't trust him.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.417
You bet.

26:24.668 --> 26:28.129
He got someone hospitalized
for real last year.

26:28.797 --> 26:30.840
Ow, it hurts.

26:31.049 --> 26:33.885
You idiot, put something underneath.

26:34.386 --> 26:37.013
That hurt. It's so damn rocky.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.782
Excuse me.
Can I see inside your bag?

28:18.990 --> 28:20.450
- Sorry?
- Show me.

28:20.659 --> 28:22.494
No. Go away.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.079
It's okay.

28:25.580 --> 28:26.623
What's this?

28:26.831 --> 28:27.957
You took it.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.417
I was going to pay.

28:29.584 --> 28:30.919
Let's go inside.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.129
Why?
There was a weirdo in there.

28:33.338 --> 28:34.464
Where?

28:36.675 --> 28:38.093
That guy, look.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.261
Hey, stop.

28:44.349 --> 28:45.975
Be sure to buy again.

28:46.393 --> 28:48.353
I'll be coming next time.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.063
Make it cheap, okay?

28:50.438 --> 28:51.981
No deal.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.441
I'm off.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.131
You wanna play, huh?

29:26.099 --> 29:27.600
Bunch of idiots.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.868
Give it up already!

29:46.786 --> 29:48.830
You little bitch.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.396
Oh, shit.

30:16.024 --> 30:18.693
Oh no, hey...

30:28.828 --> 30:30.330
Are you kidding me?

30:40.048 --> 30:41.382
Shit.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.186
Isn't that Takuya's car?

30:53.353 --> 30:54.854
Yeah, that moron.

30:56.564 --> 30:58.525
That guy's here again.

30:59.067 --> 31:01.402
That idiot doesn't give up.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.405
What the hell...?

31:04.572 --> 31:06.157
You don't know, Mr. Kono?

31:09.077 --> 31:10.203
Help them out.

31:10.370 --> 31:11.830
I think we better stay away.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.101
I'm in charge here.

31:33.268 --> 31:34.269
Mr. Kono?

32:13.892 --> 32:15.184
Are you alright?

32:16.603 --> 32:18.146
This one's mental.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.647
Take him away.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.274
Watch out.

32:52.847 --> 32:53.848
Mr. Kono.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.516
That's enough.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.477
Stop it, now.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.312
You'll kill him.

33:02.732 --> 33:03.691
Wake up.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.830
- You okay?
- Don't touch me.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.123
Hey!

34:43.291 --> 34:45.001
Hey there.

34:48.838 --> 34:51.132
What happened to your face?

34:51.299 --> 34:53.092
Tanaka from Takahama.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.802
- Show me.
- It sucked.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.805
The first hit got my teeth
in the back.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.599
- Gross.
- Don't say that.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.017
Check that out.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.686
Nice, go for it.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.188
They're ugly.

35:05.563 --> 35:06.856
You like ugly ones?

35:07.065 --> 35:08.483
Better than your chick.

35:08.483 --> 35:09.942
My girlfriend's hot.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.360
She's a hippo, dude.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.696
She's hotter than anyone.

35:13.905 --> 35:15.198
Screw you.

35:15.907 --> 35:17.033
Do you wanna hang out?

35:17.241 --> 35:18.701
Are you busy today?

35:20.411 --> 35:22.205
How about you two?

35:42.558 --> 35:44.018
You're losing.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.229
Shut up. I'm winning.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.064
What's this game?

35:48.272 --> 35:49.398
Dunno.

35:50.108 --> 35:51.234
You don't know?

35:51.609 --> 35:53.569
You've been here for ages.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.196
You too.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.907
Check this out.

35:59.784 --> 36:01.244
Is that your avatar?

36:01.953 --> 36:05.039
I'm screwing every
stupid bitch in the game.

36:05.957 --> 36:08.251
- That's weird.
- It's intense.

36:08.459 --> 36:09.585
I'm a maniac here.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.420
That's just stupid.

36:11.629 --> 36:14.590
Look, I'm doing it standing up.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.926
What the...

36:20.471 --> 36:22.098
- Kaneda.
- Clothes off.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.433
What are you doing?
Wait.

36:24.642 --> 36:25.685
Your clothes...

36:31.983 --> 36:33.109
Hey, Kaneda.

37:07.185 --> 37:09.145
That's messed up.

37:14.525 --> 37:17.320
That looks pretty cool.

37:17.528 --> 37:19.155
Not really.

37:27.955 --> 37:29.123
Excuse me.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.792
Those work clothes...

37:32.627 --> 37:34.462
What are you looking at?

37:35.630 --> 37:37.173
Hey, Shota.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.133
What's up?

37:39.800 --> 37:41.344
My brother's clothes.

37:42.887 --> 37:45.056
- He's gotta be near.
- Wait, Shota.

37:49.810 --> 37:50.978
Look at that.

37:51.145 --> 37:54.482
This one's easy to win. Look.

37:55.983 --> 37:59.695
Man, those girls earlier
had huge boobs.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.156
I know, right?

38:02.323 --> 38:04.951
They were seriously huge.

38:06.661 --> 38:08.287
What are you doing, Shota?

38:09.413 --> 38:10.498
What is it?

38:15.169 --> 38:17.046
Help me find my brother.

38:18.673 --> 38:19.840
Whatever, sure.

38:23.511 --> 38:24.845
His brother.

38:25.846 --> 38:27.014
Was he here?

38:27.181 --> 38:28.182
I don't know.

38:28.683 --> 38:30.518
He wouldn't be here.

38:38.609 --> 38:40.403
Get a life, seriously.

38:45.533 --> 38:47.702
This is so messed up.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.413
So unfair.

38:52.707 --> 38:54.250
Why me?

38:57.044 --> 38:58.546
So damn hot.

38:59.046 --> 39:01.257
God, this sucks.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.050
Dammit.

39:18.649 --> 39:19.608
Hey, Shota.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.279
Let's call it a day.

39:25.740 --> 39:27.658
We didn't come here for this.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.289
I'll search on my own.

39:35.291 --> 39:37.084
I know this area well.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.421
We've gotta act quick.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.675
Let's split up, then.

39:45.343 --> 39:46.802
I'll look around here.

39:48.262 --> 39:50.264
Okay. I'll call you later.

39:50.264 --> 39:51.307
Sure.

40:34.141 --> 40:36.560
Pick up.This is a great chance.

40:43.901 --> 40:46.404
I'll get back at him.

41:04.672 --> 41:06.507
Yeah, get him.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.561
Get out of the way, morons.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.536
Hold him down.

42:49.109 --> 42:50.277
You asshole.

42:52.488 --> 42:53.739
Don't interfere.

43:20.057 --> 43:21.058
Take him away.

43:22.101 --> 43:24.103
Awesome...

43:36.615 --> 43:37.616
Oh no...

43:39.159 --> 43:40.661
Cops!

43:41.036 --> 43:43.038
The cops are coming!

44:19.116 --> 44:21.410
You were awesome!

44:21.869 --> 44:23.412
I mean, for real.

44:23.621 --> 44:25.789
You... were amazing.

44:27.583 --> 44:28.584
That...

44:30.210 --> 44:31.378
Well, um...

44:32.379 --> 44:35.090
I wanted to do something too.

44:36.592 --> 44:37.593
It's so tattered.

44:38.927 --> 44:39.887
What?

44:40.971 --> 44:41.972
Oh, this shirt?

44:41.972 --> 44:44.433
Come on, these are
your work clothes.

44:44.642 --> 44:46.310
And that's mine.

44:46.977 --> 44:49.021
It's pretty cool, huh?

44:51.940 --> 44:53.275
It's not enough.

44:58.656 --> 45:00.157
I need three more.

45:01.492 --> 45:02.451
What...?

45:06.580 --> 45:07.873
I made up my mind.

45:14.463 --> 45:15.464
About what?

45:23.097 --> 45:24.598
You still gonna fight?

45:25.974 --> 45:28.060
If you're gonna do it,

45:28.310 --> 45:29.895
then let's go all out, man!

45:31.355 --> 45:33.399
That'd be so much better.

45:34.024 --> 45:35.067
You and me...

45:35.234 --> 45:37.444
we can do something
amazing together.

45:38.779 --> 45:43.117
If I hang around with you,
I think it'd be super fun.

45:45.619 --> 45:46.620
Can I come?

45:47.454 --> 45:48.455
Okay?

45:49.665 --> 45:50.833
Where are you?

45:52.793 --> 45:54.294
I can't find it.

46:00.342 --> 46:01.802
I'm at the corner.

46:09.309 --> 46:10.310
He's here.

46:10.811 --> 46:12.020
Welcome.

46:13.313 --> 46:15.149
Nana will give you a treat.

46:16.483 --> 46:17.985
She sure will.

46:18.527 --> 46:19.653
Come on inside.

46:20.279 --> 46:23.198
No thanks. I have to
look for my brother.

46:23.657 --> 46:26.368
She might know where he is.

46:27.911 --> 46:29.371
Come on. Let's go in.

46:32.624 --> 46:35.669
Stop that, Shota.
Nana is creeped out.

46:36.336 --> 46:38.046
She says she's seen him.

46:39.923 --> 46:41.842
He was in work clothes?

46:42.926 --> 46:46.221
He got beat up
and his teeth were broken.

46:46.430 --> 46:47.514
Show them.

46:47.973 --> 46:50.058
That's scary.

46:50.267 --> 46:51.602
Are you Japanese?

46:51.602 --> 46:53.896
- You're always fighting.
- I'm Chinese.

46:54.104 --> 46:57.357
Yeah, we Mitsuhama guys
have to be tough.

46:57.524 --> 46:58.859
Exactly.

46:59.026 --> 47:00.903
The weak keep quiet.

47:01.069 --> 47:02.529
The strong will triumph!

47:02.696 --> 47:04.406
Everyone knows that.

47:05.282 --> 47:06.533
Apart from him.

47:07.117 --> 47:08.202
Why?

47:08.368 --> 47:10.078
His bro is really strong.

47:10.662 --> 47:12.122
Who knows what he'll do?

47:13.040 --> 47:14.249
What do you mean?

47:15.959 --> 47:17.419
Don't go crazy, Kenji.

47:18.128 --> 47:21.548
You freaked out over
your brother's clothes.

47:22.216 --> 47:24.259
- Yeah, so?
- Come on.

47:24.885 --> 47:26.887
You idiot.

47:33.727 --> 47:37.231
You know, his brother
was lynched by the Takahama gang.

47:38.315 --> 47:39.566
Says who?

47:39.733 --> 47:40.901
He's on the run.

47:41.068 --> 47:43.487
You're just making things up.

47:43.862 --> 47:45.239
That's enough.

47:45.531 --> 47:47.074
Stop it, Kenji.

47:48.659 --> 47:50.285
Time to go home.

47:50.911 --> 47:52.246
The bill, please.

48:03.423 --> 48:05.509
We can't make him pay.

48:08.512 --> 48:10.180
His brother ran off,

48:12.099 --> 48:13.600
and he has no parents.

48:15.435 --> 48:16.645
Hey, stop.

48:16.854 --> 48:18.146
Ouch, that hurt.

48:21.108 --> 48:22.317
Are you okay?

48:29.658 --> 48:31.118
Get outside.

48:39.126 --> 48:40.294
You can't...

48:42.963 --> 48:45.007
Hey, stop, enough.

48:45.465 --> 48:46.466
No, don't.

48:46.842 --> 48:48.176
Get lost.

48:48.886 --> 48:49.970
We're sorry.

49:01.815 --> 49:03.483
Who let those kids in?

49:06.737 --> 49:08.196
He's furious.

49:08.614 --> 49:10.657
- Apologize.
- Huh?

49:10.824 --> 49:12.451
They were clearly kids.

49:13.827 --> 49:15.037
I didn't

49:16.079 --> 49:19.166
It really hurt when you bumped into me.

49:20.709 --> 49:22.502
Let's call it a day.

49:22.502 --> 49:23.295
Really?

49:23.587 --> 49:26.340
Pay a visit to Mr. Kono at the hospital.

49:26.924 --> 49:27.883
Yes.

49:33.972 --> 49:35.807
We can get him back later.

49:36.224 --> 49:37.392
Are you alright?

49:42.481 --> 49:43.565
Man...

49:44.399 --> 49:46.818
We could've gotten laid tonight.

49:48.904 --> 49:49.863
Kenji...

49:54.326 --> 49:55.327
See ya.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.873
- Wait a sec.
- Leave him.

50:12.344 --> 50:14.054
This is so exciting.

50:15.681 --> 50:17.099
I've got chills.

50:20.352 --> 50:22.354
Who'd be our monster?

50:23.522 --> 50:25.482
It better be strong.

50:36.910 --> 50:38.996
A real adventure!

50:45.711 --> 50:48.922
This gentleman will be
our first monster.

50:49.923 --> 50:53.552
- You taking a video of us?
- Not you, the street, idiot!

50:53.719 --> 50:55.637
- Stop it.
- Here he comes.

50:56.888 --> 50:57.973
What do you want?

50:59.224 --> 51:00.183
You freak!

51:03.020 --> 51:04.730
Wow, nasty...

51:05.731 --> 51:07.441
Sorry man, it's a game.

51:07.858 --> 51:09.985
- To the next.
- What the hell are...

51:11.069 --> 51:13.238
- Oh, no.
- What the hell?

51:13.530 --> 51:15.490
The dumbass flew into the flame.

51:24.332 --> 51:26.168
Shit, look at him.

51:27.252 --> 51:29.004
You've gone way too far!

51:29.337 --> 51:32.466
What did you say, you midge?
Get outta here!

51:32.632 --> 51:34.468
You little piece of shit.

51:37.095 --> 51:38.680
Look at him go.

51:39.473 --> 51:41.558
We're the strongest of all!

51:42.142 --> 51:43.477
Anything goes.

51:45.812 --> 51:46.772
Hey.

51:46.980 --> 51:49.191
His wallet's loaded!

51:50.400 --> 51:52.527
All right man, here we go!

51:53.820 --> 51:55.363
What are you lookin' at?

51:56.990 --> 51:58.950
I wonder what my role is?

52:02.704 --> 52:04.831
Thief? No, not cool.

52:04.998 --> 52:05.999
So what is it?

52:06.333 --> 52:08.668
I know I'm not a Dancer.

52:08.919 --> 52:10.337
Well, I don't care.

52:10.629 --> 52:11.630
Beastmaster?

52:13.340 --> 52:15.175
"I'll be the king of pirates!"

52:15.342 --> 52:16.343
Says Luffy.

52:17.260 --> 52:18.512
There you go.

52:20.013 --> 52:22.182
Hey, I'm not bad myself.

52:22.808 --> 52:24.267
I'm cool, ain't I?

52:25.185 --> 52:27.562
Let's have some fun at the mall.

52:28.313 --> 52:29.272
Right?

52:29.606 --> 52:30.690
Wait!

52:31.691 --> 52:33.360
You can't get away.

52:33.693 --> 52:35.028
You chick.

52:35.695 --> 52:37.405
Does that hurt? Huh?

52:37.572 --> 52:38.532
I'm asking you.

52:38.698 --> 52:41.034
Cry if it hurts, go on.

52:41.326 --> 52:42.786
Answer me, bitch.

52:44.621 --> 52:45.872
Let's go.

52:47.290 --> 52:49.251
Here I come, you bastards.

53:01.054 --> 53:03.056
We're gonna get all of you.

53:06.434 --> 53:08.895
Hey, dog-face.
You dog-face!

53:14.276 --> 53:16.736
To the right and left.

53:17.237 --> 53:18.572
Look at your hair.

53:18.905 --> 53:20.615
What do you want, fag?

53:22.117 --> 53:23.451
This guy's awesome.

53:25.287 --> 53:26.955
What are you looking at?

53:30.167 --> 53:31.168
You!

53:32.252 --> 53:35.088
A fortuneteller?
Did you foresee this?

53:35.964 --> 53:38.091
Shit.
What do you want?

53:38.508 --> 53:40.844
What the hell?
Get away from me.

53:41.761 --> 53:43.680
What's your experience level?

53:43.930 --> 53:45.891
Here comes an enemy!

53:46.641 --> 53:47.809
Stop it.

53:48.101 --> 53:50.437
I said stop! Don't touch me.

53:53.607 --> 53:56.359
I guess I am a Beastmaster.

54:00.197 --> 54:01.948
Enough. Let's go.

54:02.532 --> 54:03.950
Off to the next place.

54:07.037 --> 54:10.290
"Look out world!"

54:15.837 --> 54:17.839
I feel awesome!

54:23.178 --> 54:24.471
You know what?

54:25.138 --> 54:26.932
I've always wanted...

54:28.225 --> 54:30.018
to beat a girl real hard.

54:31.645 --> 54:33.063
Wasn't it great?

54:35.148 --> 54:36.316
What we did is...

54:36.524 --> 54:38.526
called a "Knockout Game."

54:44.866 --> 54:46.952
Everyone's talking about us.

54:57.837 --> 54:58.838
Hey...

55:00.423 --> 55:01.716
Let's go somewhere else.

55:06.179 --> 55:07.138
I mean...

55:08.431 --> 55:10.433
Getting caught ends our game.

55:11.393 --> 55:13.520
The prey we find here is too weak.

55:15.355 --> 55:16.356
Look.

55:16.564 --> 55:20.193
I want to do something big, you know?

55:22.946 --> 55:23.989
We can do it.

55:24.614 --> 55:26.032
The two of us.

55:27.284 --> 55:28.368
Don't you think?

55:32.789 --> 55:34.249
Journey around Shikoku.

55:34.708 --> 55:35.875
We can go wild.

56:20.503 --> 56:22.630
So, you saw the incident?

56:23.673 --> 56:25.133
What was it like?

56:26.176 --> 56:28.261
There were two of them.

56:29.012 --> 56:32.474
All of a sudden
one started hitting people.

56:32.682 --> 56:36.478
It caused quite
a commotion in this mall.

56:38.688 --> 56:39.814
I was shocked.

56:40.357 --> 56:43.485
And did people come to help?

56:44.027 --> 56:50.241
Some were yelling to call the police...

57:30.407 --> 57:32.700
<i>We're gonna get all of you!</i>

57:40.333 --> 57:42.168
How come I was blamed?

57:42.669 --> 57:44.671
Hey look.
They're crazy.

57:45.338 --> 57:46.798
It's right over there.

57:47.090 --> 57:48.842
Why do you ignore me?

57:49.008 --> 57:50.969
The battery's dying.

57:51.177 --> 57:52.345
So, let's go.

57:52.512 --> 57:53.680
Sure.

57:55.181 --> 57:56.182
Whatever.

58:00.270 --> 58:01.229
Bitch!

58:08.570 --> 58:09.863
Something wrong?

58:10.947 --> 58:12.407
Her period, I guess.

58:13.116 --> 58:14.409
That must be a pain...

58:30.467 --> 58:31.843
Damn it.

58:32.135 --> 58:34.929
What are you doing?

58:35.138 --> 58:36.764
Sorry about that.

58:53.072 --> 58:54.741
What's going on?

58:54.949 --> 58:56.326
I scratched my car.

58:57.494 --> 58:58.953
No shit.

58:59.746 --> 59:01.956
What's this pole doing here?

59:03.583 --> 59:05.084
Wow...

59:06.002 --> 59:07.879
Looks like an expensive car.

59:08.254 --> 59:09.422
Yes, it is.

59:10.340 --> 59:11.883
I just got my license.

59:12.592 --> 59:13.760
Nice wheels.

59:13.927 --> 59:15.303
It's not mine. Dammit...

59:16.262 --> 59:18.223
It's perfect.

59:24.562 --> 59:26.064
Hey, what...!

59:38.868 --> 59:40.537
Dump him somewhere.

59:42.622 --> 59:43.957
Do as you please.

59:54.467 --> 59:57.136
What should I do with her?

01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:05.979
Hey!

01:00:05.979 --> 01:00:06.980
Wait, bitch.

01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:08.356
I said wait!

01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:14.362
You messing with us?

01:00:19.826 --> 01:00:21.244
Leave me out!

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:22.996
Shut up.

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:33.881
Let's keep this one.

01:00:37.427 --> 01:00:39.095
I won't tell anyone...

01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:41.306
That won't help.

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:43.725
You just be quiet.

01:01:01.826 --> 01:01:04.912
Who the hell are you?

01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:06.706
Let's go back.

01:01:06.873 --> 01:01:08.207
Keep going.

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:09.375
Stop!

01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:13.880
A stupid bunch.

01:01:14.547 --> 01:01:16.424
Stop it, please.

01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:20.970
I said stop!

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:22.639
Okay. Cut!

01:01:23.264 --> 01:01:24.432
Let's go.

01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:27.810
Someone help, please!

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:31.230
- Can't you hear me?
- That's enough.

01:02:40.133 --> 01:02:41.801
Come on, swipe it.

01:02:47.473 --> 01:02:50.017
You've got to be kidding me...

01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:03.865
It came off by itself...

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.672
Punch them once, and that's it.

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:24.510
I have my own rules.

01:03:25.595 --> 01:03:26.637
What?

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.893
You just want fun too.

01:03:36.773 --> 01:03:38.399
It's over if we get caught.

01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.518
Close the door, will ya?

01:05:03.609 --> 01:05:05.570
What's he thinking?

01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:16.956
What?

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:28.092
Don't do anything stupid.

01:05:29.385 --> 01:05:31.095
You don't wanna mess with us.

01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:42.273
Just listen to me, alright?

01:05:48.905 --> 01:05:50.114
Good lookin'.

01:05:52.617 --> 01:05:53.618
You a hooker?

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:56.954
Are you?

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:04.337
What did you do?

01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:05.463
Nothing...

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:08.341
You called the cops?

01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:09.634
No way...

01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:12.595
- This car...
- Did you?

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.181
Bitch.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.187
Did you?

01:06:24.357 --> 01:06:25.983
You messin' with me?

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.653
Who do you think you are?

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:31.489
You want me to kill you?

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.080
You know...

01:07:22.415 --> 01:07:24.417
She's been resisting.

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:30.798
I'll put her in the trunk.

01:07:33.009 --> 01:07:33.968
No...

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:36.303
Come along.

01:07:46.939 --> 01:07:48.274
Keep quiet.

01:07:55.448 --> 01:07:56.657
Are you scared?

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.600
Don't make a sound.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.537
I'm at the site of the incident.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:29.082
<i>The suspects are two 18 year-old males,</i>

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:32.586
<i>one with no fixed address,
another from Matsuyama.</i>

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.216
<i>Videos of them in action
can be found on the Internet.</i>

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.676
<i>You can't get away.</i>

01:09:39.885 --> 01:09:41.261
<i>You chick!</i>

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.764
<i>Does that hurt? Huh?</i>

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:47.184
<i>Cry if it hurts, go on.</i>

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:49.270
<i>Answer me, bitch.</i>

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.773
<i>Tell me, how did it happen?</i>

01:09:52.982 --> 01:09:57.611
<i>I was on my way back from school
when I heard some screams.</i>

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.573
<i>I saw people taking videos and all.</i>

01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:03.284
<i>Guys were beating people up.</i>

01:10:03.492 --> 01:10:06.704
<i>I panicked and tried to run away.</i>

01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:09.373
<i>People were screaming like crazy.</i>

01:10:09.999 --> 01:10:12.209
<i>Everyone was yelling.</i>

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:17.715
<i>Some yelled to call an ambulance,
others for the police.</i>

01:10:36.108 --> 01:10:37.276
Hey, Ike.

01:10:37.443 --> 01:10:38.611
Let's take a break.

01:10:44.325 --> 01:10:45.284
Oh?

01:10:45.451 --> 01:10:46.660
Out all night?

01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.370
That's something.

01:10:48.871 --> 01:10:51.207
You were the same when you were 16.

01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:54.293
Is Shota hard-working
like his bro?

01:10:55.127 --> 01:10:56.295
Can't say.

01:10:56.754 --> 01:10:58.797
How did the meeting go?

01:10:59.381 --> 01:11:01.634
They just talked on their own.

01:11:02.551 --> 01:11:03.719
Idiots.

01:11:04.136 --> 01:11:07.348
At the festival everyone's the same.

01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:09.141
You guys go for it.

01:11:10.893 --> 01:11:12.144
Someone's here.

01:11:13.979 --> 01:11:15.022
Who are they?

01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:35.626
<i>“Found your bro going wild.“</i>

01:11:35.793 --> 01:11:36.877
<i>“He's famous.“</i>

01:11:37.086 --> 01:11:39.171
<i>"The Takahama gang will chicken out."</i>

01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:00.734
Shota.

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:02.653
Were you there?

01:12:05.114 --> 01:12:06.865
At Main Street Arcade?

01:12:09.285 --> 01:12:10.577
No, I wasn't.

01:12:10.786 --> 01:12:12.746
- Seems like your...
- I said I wasn't!

01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:14.290
The police are here.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.251
- They won't accept that.
- Stop it.

01:12:17.418 --> 01:12:19.586
- Calm down, you.
- Let go.

01:12:20.129 --> 01:12:21.338
Where did Taira go?

01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:23.257
Don't come up here.

01:12:23.632 --> 01:12:24.883
Go back downstairs.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.260
Don't talk that way.

01:12:26.468 --> 01:12:28.721
- What happened?
- It's our place.

01:12:29.305 --> 01:12:30.597
Get out!

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.850
Shota.

01:12:33.684 --> 01:12:35.436
You guys are too late.

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.106
Taira is...

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:40.691
long gone!

01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:44.778
Don't pretend to care!

01:12:44.945 --> 01:12:46.363
Stop it, Shota.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:49.116
You never cared.

01:12:49.325 --> 01:12:50.242
Enough!

01:12:50.242 --> 01:12:51.952
- Come here.
- Hold it.

01:12:52.161 --> 01:12:53.454
Leave me alone!

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:58.500
I'm alright.

01:13:03.005 --> 01:13:04.131
I'm telling you.

01:13:06.675 --> 01:13:07.968
There're rules here.

01:13:26.028 --> 01:13:30.824
<i>Now, more on
the random attack in Matsuyama.</i>

01:13:31.325 --> 01:13:37.247
Around 9 o'clock lost night,
passers-by were randomly attacked

01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:41.585
<i>by two teenagers in Matsuyama city.</i>

01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:44.963
<i>They later escaped in a stolen car.</i>

01:13:45.506 --> 01:13:47.299
<i>There's no trace of them.</i>

01:13:48.467 --> 01:13:51.470
<i>Police have set roadblocks
throughout the prefecture,</i>

01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:54.848
<i>and have released sketches
of the suspects...</i>

01:14:49.445 --> 01:14:50.779
What did you do?

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.033
Whatever...

01:14:59.121 --> 01:15:00.247
Come out.

01:15:00.622 --> 01:15:01.748
What have you done?

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:04.084
I said, come out!

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.128
What've you...

01:15:06.128 --> 01:15:08.088
Get lost, son of a bitch!

01:15:08.297 --> 01:15:10.799
- Stop bugging us!
- Open the door!

01:15:12.801 --> 01:15:14.553
I'm calling the police.

01:15:18.474 --> 01:15:19.433
Come out.

01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:21.560
Come out now!

01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:24.104
Enough with this...

01:15:26.482 --> 01:15:27.566
Do you know what you...

01:15:30.903 --> 01:15:32.070
You shit.

01:15:33.697 --> 01:15:35.324
You messin' with me?

01:15:35.866 --> 01:15:37.784
Don't you ever mess with me.

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:51.006
And what's this?

01:15:52.007 --> 01:15:52.966
You.

01:15:57.346 --> 01:15:59.348
Sittin' there saying nothing.

01:16:02.518 --> 01:16:04.561
I don't interest you, huh?

01:16:07.022 --> 01:16:09.733
I'm asking you, so don't ignore me!

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:14.488
You've caused all this.

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:22.329
I'm done.

01:16:22.538 --> 01:16:24.289
I quit, son of a bitch.

01:16:24.289 --> 01:16:26.124
I can't do this anymore.

01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:28.877
I've had enough.

01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:30.796
To hell with everything!

01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:58.073
Get out.

01:17:00.075 --> 01:17:01.034
Out.

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:04.913
I said get out.

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.336
Go on, quick.

01:17:12.504 --> 01:17:13.964
You can drive, can't you?

01:17:18.093 --> 01:17:20.012
Hurry it up, bitch.

01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:36.903
Hey.

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:39.781
Hey!
What're you doing?

01:17:40.616 --> 01:17:42.284
Hurry up. Go!

01:17:43.285 --> 01:17:45.912
I'll kill you if you do anything stupid.

01:17:47.789 --> 01:17:49.082
Quick!

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.462
Come on, get a move now.

01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:54.921
Want me to kill ya?

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:56.715
Step on the gas.

01:17:56.923 --> 01:17:58.675
What the hell?

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.260
Step on the gas.

01:18:00.469 --> 01:18:01.928
Make it quick!

01:18:02.846 --> 01:18:04.598
The hand brake,you idiot.

01:18:05.057 --> 01:18:06.767
Bitch! I'll kill ya.

01:18:06.975 --> 01:18:08.602
The gas pedal.

01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:10.395
Go, go now!

01:18:10.646 --> 01:18:12.147
Get a move on.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.126
What did you do now?

01:18:57.192 --> 01:18:58.819
What's taking so long?

01:19:29.224 --> 01:19:30.809
You've done a great job.

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.779
I didn't tell you to go that far.

01:21:08.949 --> 01:21:09.950
How was it?

01:21:12.953 --> 01:21:14.204
Stop it.

01:21:14.371 --> 01:21:15.372
Tell me.

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:18.375
Just go.

01:21:33.098 --> 01:21:34.432
I got it now.

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:36.685
I mean... come on.

01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:39.563
She's done it, too.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:41.481
She's ahead of us.

01:21:42.983 --> 01:21:45.610
She's far from being a hostage.

01:21:45.944 --> 01:21:47.279
She's an accomplice.

01:21:50.866 --> 01:21:52.701
Don't go mute.

01:21:53.451 --> 01:21:55.161
We're all a team.

01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:58.039
We're the Miracle Three.

01:21:58.456 --> 01:21:59.457
Miracle...

01:22:01.001 --> 01:22:02.502
This is all wrong!

01:22:02.836 --> 01:22:05.714
We're just too special or what?

01:22:05.714 --> 01:22:07.340
Try and catch us.

01:22:07.799 --> 01:22:10.969
We'll beat the shit out of you!

01:22:11.136 --> 01:22:14.973
Come on out whoever you are,
scumbags.

01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:16.516
You two!

01:22:17.142 --> 01:22:19.311
Have more fun, will you?

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:22.939
Everyone's a piece of shit.

01:22:23.982 --> 01:22:26.109
I will destroy you all.

01:22:27.652 --> 01:22:29.195
We can go anywhere.

01:22:29.404 --> 01:22:31.531
Let's go to the ocean and cross it!

01:22:33.909 --> 01:22:36.536
Because we're the greatest accomplices!

01:22:39.623 --> 01:22:41.333
Where are you going?

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.543
How the hell should I know?

01:22:47.339 --> 01:22:48.423
Hey.

01:22:48.423 --> 01:22:50.383
Hey!
What's she doing?

01:22:50.592 --> 01:22:55.847
Stop it.
Slow down.

01:22:55.847 --> 01:22:57.515
I said slow down!

01:22:58.475 --> 01:23:00.060
You've gone mad.

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:02.437
Stop.

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.689
Slow down!
You're insane!

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.941
Stop...

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:39.349
Shit...

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:43.019
Are you alright?

01:23:45.939 --> 01:23:47.440
I'll call an ambulance.

01:24:10.171 --> 01:24:11.339
You alright?

01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:14.092
I'm calling an ambulance.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:15.635
Hello?

01:24:16.428 --> 01:24:18.054
It's a car accident.

01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:21.725
I don't know...

01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:27.272
I've had enough...

01:24:40.994 --> 01:24:42.495
What's fun about this?

01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:14.110
You ain't finished yet.

01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:17.030
Hey.

01:25:18.406 --> 01:25:19.699
Stand up.

01:25:34.923 --> 01:25:36.132
Please, stop.

01:25:43.598 --> 01:25:44.557
Come on.

01:25:54.234 --> 01:25:55.401
That's it.

01:25:57.028 --> 01:25:58.113
We've gotta run.

01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:34.607
You're disgusting.

01:26:35.817 --> 01:26:37.694
What a mess, you bastard.

01:26:38.903 --> 01:26:39.946
Bitch!

01:26:40.155 --> 01:26:41.906
You're dirty and disgusting!

01:26:51.541 --> 01:26:54.419
Accomplice?
Don't make me laugh!

01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:56.296
Now you wanna run?

01:26:56.462 --> 01:26:57.881
You piece of shit.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.592
You scumbag! Go to hell!

01:27:01.843 --> 01:27:04.345
You're not worth shit.
just die!

01:27:08.183 --> 01:27:09.684
Loser! Scum!

01:27:10.018 --> 01:27:12.478
The only thing you deserve is hell!

01:27:25.158 --> 01:27:26.284
Dumbass.

01:27:29.204 --> 01:27:30.663
And now this shitbag's dead?

01:28:59.002 --> 01:29:01.170
Do you have a minute?

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.880
Sorry, we have to go.

01:29:03.172 --> 01:29:04.674
Just a few questions.

01:29:04.841 --> 01:29:06.050
Sorry, no.

01:29:06.217 --> 01:29:09.262
He's not involved, so excuse us.

01:29:10.096 --> 01:29:12.765
He's a minor, don't film him.

01:29:13.099 --> 01:29:14.100
I mean it.

01:29:15.018 --> 01:29:16.936
Any comment from his family?

01:29:17.103 --> 01:29:18.354
Sorry.

01:29:18.521 --> 01:29:20.815
We don't know anything yet.

01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:23.818
We're about to interview him.

01:29:26.154 --> 01:29:29.240
Did your brother say anything
before he left?

01:29:31.951 --> 01:29:33.202
Do you know him?

01:29:33.369 --> 01:29:34.329
This boy.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:46.632
We want to know
about your brother's friends.

01:29:49.927 --> 01:29:51.387
They're in the videos.

01:29:51.846 --> 01:29:53.848
We know your brother did it.

01:29:55.016 --> 01:29:56.392
Help us find him.

01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:59.062
What if things get worse?

01:30:01.022 --> 01:30:02.273
Don't you know anyone?

01:30:03.566 --> 01:30:07.487
You're the only one
who knows your brother well...

01:30:15.787 --> 01:30:17.455
How can I explain...

01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:20.625
We were neighbors.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:24.837
His father died
when he was still very small.

01:30:26.381 --> 01:30:28.383
His mother was never around.

01:30:29.384 --> 01:30:31.677
We had no idea where she was.

01:30:33.805 --> 01:30:36.015
He didn't have any relatives.

01:30:37.392 --> 01:30:40.061
So I pitched in to help.

01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:42.563
He was a child.

01:30:43.564 --> 01:30:45.233
We needed to help out.

01:30:48.069 --> 01:30:49.862
Was he out of control?

01:30:50.738 --> 01:30:52.365
No, not that.

01:30:53.699 --> 01:30:55.618
He never stopped fighting with others.

01:30:56.619 --> 01:30:58.371
He's 18 years old.

01:30:59.622 --> 01:31:02.166
We carry the portable shrine at 18.

01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:04.710
You know...

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:07.755
Troublemakers must leave the town.

01:31:10.591 --> 01:31:12.135
So I told him straight.

01:31:14.262 --> 01:31:15.680
"Suit yourself."

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.480
So, you saw which one did it.

01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:33.531
The dead guy
ran over the man.

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.160
But then...

01:31:37.452 --> 01:31:40.371
The other one might have made him do it.

01:31:41.372 --> 01:31:42.748
The fugitive.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.419
So was he like the leader?

01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:53.301
I'm not sure...

01:31:54.552 --> 01:31:56.095
But I was forced to...

01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.308
He didn't speak at all.

01:32:01.309 --> 01:32:03.102
He just stared at me.

01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:07.732
I was so scared.

01:32:18.117 --> 01:32:19.285
Sorry...

01:32:21.412 --> 01:32:23.247
No one had ever beaten me.

01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:29.086
What can I say...

01:32:30.129 --> 01:32:33.132
I kind of feel sorry
for the kid who died.

01:32:35.176 --> 01:32:38.137
I mean, I won't ever forgive him.

01:32:39.096 --> 01:32:40.389
I won't, but...

01:32:40.848 --> 01:32:43.226
There's no point in hating him, right?

01:32:45.728 --> 01:32:47.647
At least I'm still alive.

01:32:49.732 --> 01:32:50.900
Of course.

<i>Please, tell everyone.</i>

01:33:04.205 --> 01:33:06.499
<i>I don't want this to
get the better of me.</i>

01:33:06.666 --> 01:33:08.793
<i>I think there are so many women...</i>

01:33:09.043 --> 01:33:12.463
<i>suffering physical and mental abuse.</i>

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:16.425

My god, the girl...

01:33:44.996 --> 01:33:46.581
I feel sorry for her.

01:33:46.914 --> 01:33:47.999
Her name's out.

01:33:48.165 --> 01:33:49.500
I'd have rescued her.

01:33:49.667 --> 01:33:50.668
No you wouldn't.

01:33:50.835 --> 01:33:52.587
I should've slept with her.

01:33:53.504 --> 01:33:54.505
I'm serious.

01:33:54.505 --> 01:33:55.673
Is this Shota's brother?

01:33:56.424 --> 01:33:57.508
Oh yeah.

01:33:57.675 --> 01:33:58.843
Might be dead now.

01:33:59.176 --> 01:34:00.344
That'll upset Shota.

01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:01.596
He wouldn't know.

01:34:01.596 --> 01:34:02.888
But still.

01:34:03.472 --> 01:34:04.890
Let's talk about Nana.

01:34:06.809 --> 01:34:08.227
Should've gotten laid!

01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:10.688
I blew my chance.

01:35:07.411 --> 01:35:08.913
Come on, quick.

01:35:11.332 --> 01:35:13.250
- Too slow.
- Be quiet.

01:35:13.918 --> 01:35:16.170
Pick up those stones.

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:17.588
One is enough.

01:35:17.922 --> 01:35:19.882
That's too many.

01:35:20.049 --> 01:35:21.550
Here they go.

01:35:21.759 --> 01:35:22.927
Oh my god.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.060
Don't just stand there.

You think Shota's still there?

01:35:37.942 --> 01:35:39.276
Give me the light.

01:36:03.092 --> 01:36:04.969

01:36:05.636 --> 01:36:06.804
Get out!

01:36:10.891 --> 01:36:11.934
Watch out.

- Kenji.
- He's gone crazy.

01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:15.164
Let go.

01:37:15.456 --> 01:37:16.791
Let go of me!

01:37:21.086 --> 01:37:22.213
Let go.

01:37:24.632 --> 01:37:25.758
Let go of me!

01:37:25.758 --> 01:37:27.510
I said let go of me.

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:30.346
What the hell are you doing?

01:37:30.638 --> 01:37:31.639

01:37:54.078 --> 01:37:55.412
