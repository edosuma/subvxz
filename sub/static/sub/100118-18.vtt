00:02.654 --> 00:04.047
Previously onDynasty...KIRBY: Next time I tell you

00:04.091 --> 00:05.831
you're being used,
maybe you'll listen.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.050
DOMINIQUE:
You should scold me
in front of Michael.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.486
That way he stays
invested in you

00:08.530 --> 00:09.661
and the House of Deveraux.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.054
They played me for the show.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.621
Can you get the pills?

00:12.664 --> 00:14.057
I'd have to find a way to
steal them from the hospital.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.058
LAURA:
I'm going to fire

00:15.102 --> 00:17.017
Carrington Atlantic's CEO,

00:17.060 --> 00:19.367
and the path will be clear
for you to own C.A. again.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.151
BLAKE:
I do appreciate
a woman who knows

00:21.195 --> 00:22.500
how to get her hands dirty.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.588
I do have feelingsfor you, Cristal.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.199
What do we do now?This.

00:35.078 --> 00:38.864
♪ Jet fighter man,
that's what I am ♪

00:38.908 --> 00:42.346
♪ 'Cause tanks go too slow...

00:42.390 --> 00:43.565
Hi there.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.568
Hey.You're up early.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.961
Couldn't sleep.
Too much nervous energy.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.790
Well, if you wantanother way to burn off energy,

00:51.834 --> 00:53.966
you can always jump offthat bike and onto me.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.360
No, it's just
this clinic fundraiser

00:56.404 --> 00:58.188
is a never-ending to-do list.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.233
Is that new priest
from the hospital,

00:59.276 --> 01:00.234
is he helping you with this?

01:00.277 --> 01:03.150
Uh-- no, he's not much help.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.716
I'll be fine.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.111
How did you even know
I was in here?

01:08.155 --> 01:10.244
Fitness app.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.942
I'm surprised to see you
already up.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.161
I heard the shower go on late.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.293
Oh. Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.034
I tried not to wake you,
but I smelled like a humidor

01:18.078 --> 01:19.514
on my way in.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.212
You know, after an afternoon
of contracts and lawyers,

01:22.256 --> 01:25.911
I got a little carried away
celebrating at the cigar club.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.740
But... once the ink is dry,

01:28.784 --> 01:31.395
Carrington Atlantic
is mine again.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.918
That's wonderful.Yeah.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.051
You know what else
is wonderful?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.052
Now that all these shenanigans
are done,

01:36.096 --> 01:37.532
you'll be seeing more of me.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.751
And after the gala, I'll be ableto say the same thing.

01:39.795 --> 01:44.626
Though I do need to see more ofyou, specifically this evening.

01:44.669 --> 01:47.498
We havea dance lesson.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.109
The hospital board
somehow convinced me

01:49.152 --> 01:51.154
that we should end the gala
with a special dance.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.764
I'll be there.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.158
But I'm counting that
as exercise on this app.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.508
God, you're so far ahead of me,
you're putting me to shame.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.645
I need a list
of all the best presents

02:03.688 --> 02:05.212
I gave youwhile we were dating.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.430
Uh, come in.Sorry.

02:06.474 --> 02:10.608
Thank you.
So, I may have accidentally

02:10.652 --> 02:12.175
discovered Liam's
wedding gift to me.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.785
And by"accidentally,"

02:13.829 --> 02:15.222
I mean I was looking for it,

02:15.265 --> 02:16.875
I didn't think I was gonna
find it, but then I did.

02:16.919 --> 02:17.963
And it's beyond perfect,

02:18.007 --> 02:19.226
and now I can't risk
being outdone.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.444
Look at this.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.230
It's our first marriage license.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.492
From when we met

02:24.535 --> 02:27.103
at City Hall.
He had it framed and matted.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.279
I can't believe he held onto it.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.498
You didn't put it back
where you found it?

02:30.541 --> 02:32.978
Oh, don't worry.
Liam is out of town.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.806
We have to pretend to be
broken up so his mother

02:34.850 --> 02:37.113
will give C.A. backto my father; it's a long story.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.636
So, gifts?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.203
Start with
the most expensive one.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.814
Well, look at what he got you.
It's not about money.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.294
It should be
something meaningful.

02:44.338 --> 02:48.298
Right, right.No, totally. Of course.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.822
So what are some meaningfulgifts that I got you?

02:50.866 --> 02:52.172
Meaningful to Liam.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.435
I know. I know.
But ever since I found this,

02:54.478 --> 02:57.264
I haven't been able
to think of one.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.832
What's with
all the dirty clothes?

03:00.876 --> 03:02.225
And the, uh, the dead plant?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.488
Hey, look.
It's called being a bachelor.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.926
I can do or not do my laundry
whenever I want.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.406
Mm-hmm.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.800
Well, it seems like
you chose to notdo.

03:11.843 --> 03:14.324
And that, that is my mail.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.761
Look at that.Are you going to Cristal's gala?

03:16.805 --> 03:18.589
I guess so.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
Wait.

03:20.461 --> 03:23.986
I didn't know Kelly and Donna
were performing.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.248
Do you know who they are?

03:26.467 --> 03:28.338
They are Liam's favorite band.

03:28.382 --> 03:31.123
Yes, he plays their song
"Lovelorn" all the time.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.777
Like, weirdly, a lot.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.999
This is the perfect present.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.479
You're gonna invite him
to the gala?

03:38.522 --> 03:42.134
No! No.
I am going to do one better.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.833
I am going to get
Kelly and Donna

03:44.876 --> 03:46.878
to perform at my wedding.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.405
So, how excited are we
about tonight?

03:51.448 --> 03:53.624
Weare not excited
about anything,

03:53.668 --> 03:55.147
because I am still
mad at you

03:55.191 --> 03:56.497
for ignoring me about
your friend Ramy

03:56.540 --> 03:58.455
and then lying
to me about it.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.936
But we have plans
to go see Taylor Swift.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.460
That's not happening. I
don't even like Taylor.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.723
that's a sentenceI don't understand;

04:05.767 --> 04:07.986
why did you agreeto go months ago, then?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.640
Because I was being nice.And we were still friends then.

04:09.684 --> 04:10.989
But if you ever
listened to me,

04:11.033 --> 04:12.252
you would know that
I don't like her.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.384
I do listen to you, Kirby.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.951
Who's my favorite band?

04:18.519 --> 04:20.695
Um...Moaning Lisa.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.349
She actually
doesn't sound familiar.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.873
She is a them. See?
You don't listen.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.483
And going to a concert togetherwould be something

04:26.527 --> 04:27.919
that friendswould do.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.486
And right now, this

04:29.530 --> 04:31.183
is a purely
business relationship.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.402
Remember?

04:34.796 --> 04:37.277
Ooh! You look glowy.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.279
Exercise bike.

04:39.322 --> 04:42.107
Hey. Uh, actually,
I need a favor.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.501
I hear that Kelly and Donnaare performing at your event,

04:44.545 --> 04:46.764
and I really, really needto get a meeting with them.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.288
Oh, I've only dealt
with their agent;

04:48.331 --> 04:49.506
I suppose I could
give her a call.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.594
Great! Now?

04:50.638 --> 04:52.509
After the hospital.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.294
I have a meeting
at the PT clinic.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.730
In that?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.122
What?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.602
Oh, no, nothing.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.865
Just seems like more of
an athleisure situation,

05:00.909 --> 05:02.780
but hey, what do I know?

05:02.824 --> 05:04.608
This is last season.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.611
Besides, I'm a Carrington.
Can't show up in sweats.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.309
Why don't you just call me
when you talk to their agent?

05:09.352 --> 05:11.136
'Kay.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.444
CALEB:
Excuse me.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.795
You look great.Thank you.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.797
But I need to talk with you
in private.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.626
Yeah, well, I actually havesomething I want to tell you...

05:22.670 --> 05:23.714
anyway.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.368
What is it?Here.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.370
Is everything okay?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.067
Um...

05:29.111 --> 05:30.939
I can't stop thinkingabout our kiss.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.335
Neither can I.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.988
It was a mistake.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.729
I-- It was a great mistake.

05:38.773 --> 05:41.166
But it was a mistake,nevertheless.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.385
I know.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.519
Maybe it's the
Catholic in me.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.392
How can one kiss...

05:49.436 --> 05:51.742
make me feel
so guilty?

05:51.786 --> 05:54.266
Because we both knowthat it felt like more.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.400
But I, uh...

05:57.444 --> 05:59.359
I took a vow of celibacy.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.883
So we need to stopwhatever's going on here

06:01.926 --> 06:04.059
before it goes any further.

06:04.102 --> 06:08.193
I agree. I took
vows, too.

06:08.237 --> 06:11.153
And I owe it to my
marriage to uphold them.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.024
Which would be easierif I don't go to the gala.

06:13.068 --> 06:16.201
I think that's
a good idea.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.944
Because I decided I should
tell Blake about this.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.644
Well, you have to dowhat's right for you,

06:23.687 --> 06:28.779
and I understand the needto feel absolved.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.564
Just make sureyou're considering

06:30.607 --> 06:32.043
how thiswill make Blake feel.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.354
Look, I don't havea medical degree,

06:38.398 --> 06:40.487
but it looks like you'rerecovering quite nicely

06:40.530 --> 06:42.358
for someone who just had

06:42.402 --> 06:44.534
liver surgery.Thankfully.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.057
Or else I wouldn't have been
able to do

06:46.101 --> 06:47.581
half the things we just did.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.061
I think we should repeat
all the things we just did

06:50.105 --> 06:52.194
at least once a day.Normally,I would agree.

06:52.237 --> 06:55.066
But...
I need to focus on being good.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.939
Trust me. You're
doing plenty good.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.376
That surgery
should have killed me.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.900
But for some reason,
I was spared.

07:02.944 --> 07:06.513
So, this is a chance for me
to do better.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.732
Now I want to pay it back.

07:08.776 --> 07:12.736
Or pay it forward. Point is,
I-I want to pay it.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.912
So... unlike you.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.914
It's like I just had
sex with St. Adam,

07:16.958 --> 07:18.960
which is really
kind of a turn-on.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.396
WOMAN:Dr. Carrington.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.138
Dr. Bailey needs to see you
upstairs immediately.

07:23.181 --> 07:24.748
What about? This?

07:24.792 --> 07:25.967
Oh, she's not a patient.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.273
Something about
stolen medication?

07:38.936 --> 07:40.590
Don't bother denying it,because there were eyewitnesses.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.550
Supplies, meds,
anything else you stole?

07:43.593 --> 07:45.769
Dr. Bailey, eyewitnesses
are notoriously unreliable.

07:45.813 --> 07:46.944
And security cam footage.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.642
Less unreliable.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.601
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

07:51.645 --> 07:54.430
There's a shelter
down the street.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.040
It was out of supplies...

07:56.084 --> 07:59.130
Stop. That shelter doesn't need
any help, Dr. Carrington.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.480
This is disappointing.

08:00.523 --> 08:01.785
I don't want to have to
recommend to the board

08:01.829 --> 08:03.178
that you be fired, but...Fired?

08:03.221 --> 08:04.875
What about a warning?Warnings

08:04.919 --> 08:07.443
are for things like having sex
in the supply closet.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.140
How many cameras are there
in this place?

08:10.446 --> 08:12.970
I won't take pleasure
in punishing you, Doctor.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.365
Well... at least
not in this way.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.628
So, it'll be sad
to see you go.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.369
Mm-hmm. Right.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.284
You've had it out for me
ever since I turned down

08:22.327 --> 08:24.286
your advances my first week
on the job.

08:24.329 --> 08:25.548
I resent that accusation.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.119
Maybe we can work
something out.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.302
Guess you'll want this, then.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.871
You can keep it until
an official decision is made.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.742
I'll see you tomorrow
night at the gala.

08:45.786 --> 08:48.310
You can plead your case
when you give me a tour

08:48.353 --> 08:49.920
of the manor.

08:49.964 --> 08:54.534
I'm sure it has a lot ofempty rooms and... dark corners.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.633
How'd your meeting go?
Word travels fast.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.722
You sure have a way
of making enemies.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.945
So, how can I help you,
Ms. Carrington?

09:14.989 --> 09:18.122
Actually,
Ican help you, Brooke.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.603
Help you witha big commission.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.214
My fiancé is Kelly and Donna's
number one fan.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.695
So I would like to hire them
to play at my wedding,

09:25.739 --> 09:27.305
as a surprise for him.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.394
Because, you know, what's a
better wedding gift than that?

09:29.438 --> 09:33.137
Probably nothing. But I'm afraidyou need to keep shopping.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.617
Shrewd negotiating.
I like it.

09:34.661 --> 09:38.839
Uh, I will also cover
all travel expenses for them

09:38.882 --> 09:40.057
and their entourage.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.798
And if they don't havean entourage,

09:41.842 --> 09:45.280
which is sad, I'll buy them one.
There you go.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.718
Well, I wish it was only
about money,

09:48.762 --> 09:50.894
especially after seeing this.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.722
But the ladies
don't tour anymore.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.506
They just record.

09:54.550 --> 09:55.899
They're wealthy
and only play events

09:55.943 --> 09:57.335
that are meaningful to them.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.729
I am so sick of meaningful.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.513
I know. But they
love charity.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.080
Elephants, orphans, veterans.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.996
Well, if I told them
how much Ilove charity,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.825
would that maybe
help my chances?It might.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.045
They just played an event
for their sorority,

10:11.088 --> 10:12.916
Lambda Lambda Nu, because

10:12.960 --> 10:14.918
all the proceeds went
to feed the homeless.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.833
Lambda Lambda No Way...

10:16.877 --> 10:19.096
I mean-- Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.445
That is mysorority.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.621
Maybe I should give

10:21.664 --> 10:23.013
my sisters a tour

10:23.057 --> 10:24.580
of the revamped
physical therapy clinic

10:24.624 --> 10:26.190
they'll be playing for.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.757
Well, I'm sure that would go
a long way with them.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.455
Fantastic. I'm gonna
leave that right there.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.633
Will you please tell my fellow
Lambda Lambda Nus

10:33.676 --> 10:36.461
how excited I am to meet them?
Yeah.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.639
'Cause you know, there's no bondquite like sisterhood.

10:39.682 --> 10:40.814
I'm not telling them that.

10:42.076 --> 10:45.035
No. No.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.689
Moved.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.691
Ew, no.

10:48.735 --> 10:52.086
Swiping up. New dating app?

10:52.129 --> 10:54.088
I'm actually just trying to findsomeone to go to Taylor Swift

10:54.131 --> 10:56.743
with me tonight,but no one's front row material.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.048
That's the nice thing

10:58.092 --> 10:59.310
about being married.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.138
You have a plus-one
built right in.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.793
Yeah, I guess so.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.317
Well, where's the, uh,
redhead from down under?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.536
She's mad at me.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.147
Actually, do you want to go?

11:10.191 --> 11:11.322
Oh, God, no.

11:11.366 --> 11:12.846
I'm just gonna havea chill dinner here

11:12.889 --> 11:14.195
and then go to bed early.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.805
Totally get it.
Though for someone

11:15.849 --> 11:18.373
that just had liver surgery,
you look great.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.983
Yeah, I feel great.I mean, you know,

11:20.027 --> 11:22.594
if-if you want,
we could get a bite to eat...

11:22.638 --> 11:26.033
Love to. I mean, we-we never
really get to hang out,

11:26.076 --> 11:27.382
and this is the
perfect opportunity

11:27.425 --> 11:31.778
for us to rekindle
our... acquaintance.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.346
JENNINGS: Finally.I've been waiting.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.392
The dance instructor
is gonna be here any minute.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.741
I didn't miss anything?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.612
I wanted to talk to you
before he got here.

11:40.656 --> 11:44.051
I-I apologize,but I had to stop on my way home

11:44.094 --> 11:45.966
to pick up this.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.534
Wow.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.059
Blake, this isn't something
you just "pick up."

11:52.102 --> 11:54.583
Well, nothing is too good
for my wife.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.893
So...

11:59.936 --> 12:03.200
if there's somethingyou want to talk about,

12:03.244 --> 12:05.855
you'll look like a couplemillion bucks doing it.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.250
Hmm?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.731
I...Wait now, okay?
Hold that thought.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.300
This will just take a minute.
Hopefully.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.606
What's the latest
over there?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.828
You're not
the dance instructor.

12:21.871 --> 12:25.440
And you're not Ginger Rogers.
I'm glad we got that straight.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.833
Ooh.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.270
Nice bling.

12:29.313 --> 12:32.229
I see someone's been putting
her allowance to good use.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.753
It was a present
from your father.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.451
Oh, God. Well, then, I am sorry.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.670
For what?
Having a generous husband?

12:38.714 --> 12:41.282
Right. You have a safe
in your closet filled

12:41.325 --> 12:43.893
with enough diamonds to buy
an island, but my father

12:43.937 --> 12:47.331
just happened to pick up thisseven-figure treat just because.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.943
No. He obviously
did something wrong.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.858
Isn't that kind of a cliché?

12:51.901 --> 12:53.207
Well, so is getting married
three times,

12:53.250 --> 12:54.991
but he nailed that one, too.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.819
You mind if I just...?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.734
Yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep.

12:58.778 --> 13:03.086
That is the "Daddy did somethingvery, very bad" gift.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.436
Mm-hmm. I've seen it
before. Alexis had a few.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.048
Even fake Cristal got one.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.615
He's obviously hiding something.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.487
Anyway, have a great lesson.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.797
BLAKE:
Laura Van Kirk screwed me.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.929
I just found out thatCarrington Atlantic oil tankers

13:19.973 --> 13:22.410
are being held up
in Moldavian shipping lanes.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.672
Held up by what exactly?

13:23.715 --> 13:26.762
The government wants
to nationalize oil,

13:26.806 --> 13:28.938
and get rid of C.A.'s presence
there once and for all.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.636
So the C.A. tankers reloaded
their oil, took off.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.248
But the king won't allow them
outside Moldavian waters?

13:34.291 --> 13:38.078
Exactly, and that's when Lauradecides to sell me the company.

13:38.121 --> 13:41.124
$500 million worth of oil
could be lost.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.996
Well, I'm not just
gonna give it to them.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.824
Clear my schedule.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.260
Fuel up the jet.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.523
We're going
to Moldavia tomorrow.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.923
Where's the instructor?
Let's get this over with.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.839
I sent him home.
We can practice.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.059
Though you don't seem to be inthe best frame of mind for that.

14:03.103 --> 14:06.584
Honey, I'm here.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.674
Can I ask you a question?Mm-hmm.

14:09.718 --> 14:12.068
Why did you buy
me this necklace?

14:12.112 --> 14:14.244
I told you. I haven't beenthe greatest husband

14:14.288 --> 14:16.029
and I want to get yousomething nice.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.334
Is there a problem?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.684
No, it just caught me
by surprise.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.469
It's so extravagant.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.472
Next time I'll surprise you
with a scented candle.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.171
And who were you reading
those contracts with here

14:28.215 --> 14:29.651
yesterday afternoon?

14:29.694 --> 14:31.348
Like I told you,
it was the Van Kirk lawyers.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.872
What is going on here?

14:36.136 --> 14:38.486
Why am I getting interrogated
for buying you a necklace

14:38.529 --> 14:40.140
worth more than the
GDP of most countries?

14:40.183 --> 14:42.707
You seemed to like it fine
when I gave it to you.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.796
I did, but then Fallon came in.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.538
Oh, what did my wonderful
daughter have to say?

14:47.582 --> 14:49.497
She said it looked
like an apology gift.Well,

14:49.540 --> 14:50.715
the only thing
I have to apologize for

14:50.759 --> 14:51.847
is being a thoughtful husband.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.283
Blake, you're overreacting.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.719
Oh, am I? I'm sorry.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.156
Would you like
another piece of jewelry?

14:56.199 --> 14:58.680
It won't happen again.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.470
I'm about to be fired.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.908
How can they fire you? Your lastname's all over that hospital.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.910
That doesn't hold
much sway with Dr. Bailey.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.868
Maybe this'll make you
feel better.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.569
I think this is bigger
than an ice cream sundae.

15:18.613 --> 15:19.919
Cristal saw me

15:19.962 --> 15:22.573
afterwards, she had this
smug smile on her face,

15:22.617 --> 15:24.053
like it had made her day.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.577
She's probably already
told Blake.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.579
Which is ironic,
because she's hardly been

15:28.623 --> 15:30.016
Mother Teresa these days.

15:30.059 --> 15:33.236
"These days"? Something happen?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.717
Uh, nothing.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.153
I probably shouldn't
talk about it.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.372
Oh.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.591
So you just don't trust me.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.072
No, I-I'm trying to rise
above the idle gossip.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.422
Oh.But y...

15:45.466 --> 15:46.902
I'm sure I could tell you.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.078
Um...

15:51.124 --> 15:55.563
I saw Cristal
kiss a priest.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.261
You-you can't say anything.
Promise me?

15:58.305 --> 16:01.525
I promise.Uh, does she know that you saw?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.701
No, and to be honest,

16:03.745 --> 16:05.355
I feel bad for her.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.967
Seeking comfort
in the arms of a priest?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.969
She's got to be
in a lot of pain.

16:10.012 --> 16:13.102
I'm sorry, did you have a livertransplant or a brain rewiring?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.626
Because that doesn't
sound like you.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.454
I know. I'm kind of
surprising myself.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.108
I usually don't gossip,
but Sammy Jo

16:19.152 --> 16:20.980
is really gonna die
when he hears about this.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.633
No-- Kirby, Kirby.
You just promised

16:22.677 --> 16:23.808
you wouldn't say anything.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.462
Good point.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.290
Mm-hmm.But you can't godown to Dr. Bailey

16:27.334 --> 16:28.683
without a fight.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.947
You know, I like
secretly dating a doctor.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.649
Do you have a ball gown?

16:38.693 --> 16:41.391
SAM:
In my opinion,
Kirby needs to get over it.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.872
I mean, I'm the victim here.Are we still on this?

16:43.915 --> 16:46.657
I trusted Ramy,
and I was robbed.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.311
How does that make me
a bad friend?

16:48.355 --> 16:49.704
It sounds like Kirby was
trying to warn you,

16:49.747 --> 16:51.053
and you just didn't listen.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.402
Yeah, yeah,
that's what she said.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.534
Excuse me, sir.Yes, sir?

16:53.577 --> 16:54.491
Um, I would love
another drink, please.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.840
Actually, Sam,

16:55.884 --> 16:57.712
uh, I'm gonna,
I'm-a call it a night.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.018
Now?Yeah.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.150
No, no, no, no.We're having a great time.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.761
No. He'll have another water,please. Thank you.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.285
Okay, but I'm gone
after this one.

17:05.328 --> 17:09.506
My point is, yeah, maybe Ididn't listen, but a bad friend?

17:09.550 --> 17:12.118
A bad friend is someone
who stabs you in the back.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.250
Or someone who lets
you wear lime green

17:14.294 --> 17:15.817
even when it isn't your color.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.341
: Or, well,
apparently, someone who gets

17:18.385 --> 17:20.213
great seats to a concert.

17:20.256 --> 17:22.041
That Kirby has no interest
in going to.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.346
Well, that's her loss.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.610
Oh, she texted me.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.525
It's four letters.
What is this, a code?

17:28.569 --> 17:31.137
Something the kids are
texting nowadays?

17:31.180 --> 17:32.225
Mia?

17:32.268 --> 17:34.096
Jeff Colby.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
I thought that was you.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.230
Wow, you look...Careful now.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.579
Amazing.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.537
Even better than you did
in college.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.148
That works.

17:43.671 --> 17:48.371
I, uh, I met Mia duringorientation week, freshman year.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.809
Uh, of all the bars in Atlanta,
you walk into mine.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.247
Humblebrag.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.118
I'm Sam. I own a hotel.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.381
Oh. Okay.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.817
I moved to town last week.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.210
I'm here for a friend's
bachelorette.

18:02.559 --> 18:03.517
And I better get back

18:03.560 --> 18:05.910
to bridezilla now, but...

18:05.954 --> 18:07.129
let's catch up?

18:07.173 --> 18:09.610
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.324
JENNINGS:
His heart rate went from 60

19:11.367 --> 19:13.021
to 155 in the middle
of the afternoon.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.284
How do you know that?Blake and I synced

19:15.328 --> 19:17.591
our exercise apps as a way
to motivate each other.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.114
So I looked at it
and saw the spike

19:19.158 --> 19:21.812
when he was supposedly
reading contracts.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.164
My husband had sex
with Laura Van Kirk

19:25.207 --> 19:29.080
while I-- we were planning
the foundation's event.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.127
It's humiliating.

19:35.217 --> 19:39.003
What we did was wrong,
but different.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.049
Technically, cheating
is cheating...

19:46.446 --> 19:48.230
...but you're right.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.666
It is different.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.757
So, what are you gonna do now?

19:53.801 --> 19:56.195
I don't know.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.023
It can't be a coincidence thatsomething happened between them

19:59.067 --> 20:01.548
the same day
he got C.A. back from her.

20:01.591 --> 20:02.984
What, you thinkthat he slept with her

20:03.027 --> 20:04.855
to get his company back?

20:04.899 --> 20:06.509
Maybe.

20:06.553 --> 20:10.339
I just know he'll do anything
for Carrington Atlantic.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.647
But would he do
anything for you?

20:13.690 --> 20:15.910
FALLON:
And here's

20:15.953 --> 20:17.346
the new wing.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.393
What charitable cause didyour chapter at NYU support?

20:20.436 --> 20:23.222
Uh, oh, what cause
didn't we support?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.093
You know? What cause?

20:25.136 --> 20:27.356
Homeless dogs.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.053
Homeless dogs?

20:30.490 --> 20:32.274
And cats, of course.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.495
And people, obviously.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.368
Well, that's adorable.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.631
A true sister thinksof everyone, big and small.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.372
Mm.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.722
So our agent said that your
fiancé is a big fan of ours?

20:45.766 --> 20:48.464
Yes, yes, yes. He is
like a teenage girl.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.336
But you know, in the
manliest way possible.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.773
So, what do youthink about us

20:52.816 --> 20:54.688
playing a few songsfor your wedding?

20:54.731 --> 20:57.517
I think I could kiss you.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.996
Listen, you

20:59.040 --> 21:01.869
would be a part of the greatestwedding present ever,

21:01.912 --> 21:03.349
and I would win.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.046
On three.Yeah.

21:06.526 --> 21:07.744
Oh, it's not just
a normal shake?

21:07.788 --> 21:09.877
No, I don't want that.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.922
She's trying to do the secret
sorority handshake with you.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.881
Donna, leave the
poor girl alone.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.926
WOMAN :
Code blue, OR One.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.407
Code blue, OR One.Remember?

21:18.451 --> 21:20.757
Yeah. Yeah,
of course I remember.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.411
I just-- I forgot to
tell you guys

21:22.455 --> 21:24.283
I am a full-fledged germophobe,

21:24.326 --> 21:26.110
so don't take that personally.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.590
Oh, of course not.

21:27.634 --> 21:30.419
But we can't wait tohear your speech tomorrow night.

21:30.463 --> 21:31.768
My what?Aren't you speaking

21:31.812 --> 21:32.856
at the galafor the clinic?

21:32.900 --> 21:34.249
That's what the host does.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.903
Tells the story about how
this whole idea started.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.905
It's so empoweringto see young women

21:37.948 --> 21:38.949
leading the way.

21:38.993 --> 21:40.342
We're excited to hear it.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.214
Oh, and I'm excited to give it.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.565
It's gonna be an
unbelievable story.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.138
Remember, I was dating that guy.I couldn't...Look at you two.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.749
Rekindling away.Hey, Sam.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.665
Didn't expect to see you here...again.

21:59.796 --> 22:00.971
Mia and I are catching up.

22:01.015 --> 22:01.972
Oh, nice.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.234
Continue.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.802
It was after college.
Remember?

22:05.846 --> 22:07.326
I was living in that
tiny apartment downtown.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.154
Oh, yeah.
That place was terrible.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.026
But that was where
we finally hooked up.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.462
Hello.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.334
Now I'm interested.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.466
And then she went
and got a job in Philly.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.728
I was ready to try
long distance,

22:18.772 --> 22:20.556
but you said we were too young.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.993
That we owed it to ourselves
not to be tied down.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.256
Mm. Nice line, player.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.823
Oh, well, you know I was right.

22:26.867 --> 22:29.260
And it was funwhile it lasted.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.439
Pretty much two ships
passing in the night.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.659
Yeah, timing never seems
to work out for us.

22:36.703 --> 22:37.965
SAM: Oh, timing
is overrated.

22:38.008 --> 22:40.576
Trust me, I dated
a married guy before and,

22:40.620 --> 22:43.362
well, it didn't work out,
but maybe it will for you.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.669
You're married?

22:46.713 --> 22:47.670
About five months.

22:47.714 --> 22:48.845
No ring.

22:48.889 --> 22:51.282
I, uh, guess I'm justnot that used to it.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.502
None of us are, really.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.678
Okay, so, uh,

22:55.722 --> 22:58.812
I will see you at
the gala tonight.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.486
Where's Blake?I guess

23:20.529 --> 23:22.575
he's still getting ready.
He can be a little vain.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.054
Oh, thanks for the news flash.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.796
But I see you are stillwearing the necklace,

23:26.840 --> 23:29.233
which I assume means you talkedand straightened everything out.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.366
Unless you chose to ignore itand just keep the diamonds,

23:31.410 --> 23:32.933
which is totally understandable.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.456
Everything is fine. Okay?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.415
Well, great, because
I have a favor to ask.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.677
I know, I know,two in two days.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.766
But I promise, after this one,

23:39.809 --> 23:41.855
I am willing to call it even,on account of all the lying

23:41.898 --> 23:43.813
you did to me.What is it, Fallon?

23:43.857 --> 23:45.206
Would you mind if I
gave a speech tonight?

23:45.249 --> 23:46.599
Specifically, the keynote.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.949
I know how much trouble it isto host these things,

23:48.992 --> 23:50.341
so I thought I'd help out.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.995
You know, take something
off your plate.

23:53.606 --> 23:54.911
Are you thinking, or...?

23:54.955 --> 23:56.696
This is my event, Fallon.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.915
I have an entire speech writtenthat I will be giving.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.308
But thanks for the offer.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.136
Mm.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.530
Never mind.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.488
Scotch, neat.Culhane. Culhane.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.708
You were the presidentof your fraternity, right?

24:08.751 --> 24:09.709
Actually, the treasurer.

24:09.752 --> 24:10.927
Okay, that's a little sad.

24:10.971 --> 24:13.103
But you're my experton Greek life,

24:13.147 --> 24:14.496
so I need your help with

24:14.540 --> 24:16.106
the Lambda Lambda Nu
secret handshake.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.891
It's impossible. You have to bedouble-jointed or something.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.109
I watched the video online,

24:19.153 --> 24:20.502
but they don't show you
the whole shake.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.243
So I'm hoping you canteach me the rest.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.071
Well, I can't help you
because I don't know it.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.464
That's why they call it
a "secret" handshake.

24:25.507 --> 24:26.813
Seriously?

24:26.856 --> 24:28.118
All this for a wedding band?

24:28.162 --> 24:29.946
They are not a wedding band.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.600
Liam loves Kelly and Donna.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.603
The only way he'd be happier
is if Starship played for us.

24:34.647 --> 24:35.648
He likes Starship?

24:35.691 --> 24:36.866
I know. It's weird.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.303
But anyway, if I can't get
Kelly and Donna,

24:39.347 --> 24:40.914
then I am back to square one.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.437
So what?
It's just a present.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.960
You really don't understand.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.181
If this fails,
the universe is telling me

24:47.224 --> 24:48.835
that we do not belong together.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.401
Well, at least you're
not overreacting.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.186
Well, I guess we can't all havethe perfect relationship,

24:52.229 --> 24:53.448
like you and Vanessa.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.145
I don't want to talk
about that.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.973
Didn't these women already
agree to play at your wedding?

24:57.017 --> 25:00.586
Sort of, but they won't
if they find out the truth.

25:00.629 --> 25:03.110
Which is why I need to master
that secret handshake

25:03.153 --> 25:04.851
and work on my speech

25:04.894 --> 25:06.679
on how I started this program.

25:06.722 --> 25:10.160
But you didn't start th...

25:10.204 --> 25:12.249
You'll never get away with this.

25:15.992 --> 25:17.124
Where are you going?

25:17.167 --> 25:18.734
Why aren't you dressed?

25:18.778 --> 25:20.431
Honey, there's a crisisin Moldavia

25:20.475 --> 25:21.781
that needs my immediateattention.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.913
A crisis. Really?It's serious.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.132
I'm leaving now.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.177
Oh. And are you going alone?

25:27.221 --> 25:28.570
No. Anders is going with me.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.964
What am I supposed
to tell people?

25:31.007 --> 25:32.966
No one will even notice
that I'm gone.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.098
Trust me, all eyes are
gonna be on you.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.360
What about our dance?

25:36.404 --> 25:38.580
Oh, honey,

25:38.624 --> 25:40.147
you're the love of my life.

25:40.190 --> 25:42.192
My company's in trouble.

25:42.236 --> 25:44.499
If I stay and do nothing,
it'll be fatal.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.502
Our marriage is in trouble.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.591
But apparently that's a risk
you're willing to take.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.725
I don't have a choice.
This is my legacy.

25:52.768 --> 25:55.728
I'll be back as soon as I can
and I will make it up to you.

25:55.771 --> 25:57.164
No, thanks.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.866
Dr. Bailey, you strike me
as a chardonnay drinker.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.215
Brassy, bold.

26:05.259 --> 26:06.652
Knows what she likes.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.567
Well, I do know what I like,
and you clean up well.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.656
Thank you.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.527
I was hoping that
we could revisit

26:12.571 --> 26:14.529
the discipline that you're

26:14.573 --> 26:16.575
bringing against me
to the board.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.533
You mean the disciplinethat you brought on yourself

26:18.577 --> 26:19.882
by stealing?Right.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.536
It was for a worthy cause.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.798
If I could just
explain myself...

26:22.842 --> 26:25.322
Save it. It's not aboutwhy you did it.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.063
It's about what you did,and now,

26:27.107 --> 26:29.892
it's about who you need.

26:31.633 --> 26:35.594
I'm open to working outan alternative punishment.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.248
I have a soft spot forpale men in tuxedos.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.906
You're an incredibly
beautiful woman,

26:43.950 --> 26:48.258
and, um, I'm very tempted.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.609
But I'm not gonna give in
to temptation tonight.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.092
Wow, nice dress.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.399
Back in my closet
before midnight, Cinderella.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.925
Hello, everybody.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.101
My name is Fallon Carrington,

27:05.145 --> 27:08.278
cofounder of
the Carrington Foundation.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.453
Thank you.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.803
Thank you.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.154
Now, as much as I would love

27:14.197 --> 27:16.678
to stand up here and give
this speech all by myself,

27:16.722 --> 27:17.940
which I totally could,

27:17.984 --> 27:20.029
it is time for me
to introduce you

27:20.073 --> 27:21.814
to our other keynote speaker

27:21.857 --> 27:23.859
so we could tell you
how excited we are

27:23.903 --> 27:25.469
about this project.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.647
So, without further ado,
Cristal, come on up here.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.955
Cristal?

27:32.999 --> 27:35.218
I guess Cristal's
in the ladies' room.

27:35.262 --> 27:38.569
Luckily, I have written
some words of my own.

27:38.613 --> 27:42.704
We saw a need in our community
and answered the call.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.358
The new physical therapy clinic

27:44.401 --> 27:47.361
will provide hope
and relief for veterans.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.189
It will be a refuge for them,

27:49.232 --> 27:51.539
and hopefully
an inspiration to everyone.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.806
And that is all any of us
can hope to be.

27:57.850 --> 28:01.680
When I first mentioned
this idea to my husband--

28:01.723 --> 28:04.813
to-- to my father,my father,

28:04.857 --> 28:08.730
he told me that, as a couple...of Carringtons...

28:08.774 --> 28:10.689
philanthropy is not a choice,

28:10.732 --> 28:13.343
but a way of life,
and he is so right.

28:13.387 --> 28:16.259
That's one of the things that
made me fall in love with him.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.479
And by "him,"
I mean this project.

28:18.522 --> 28:21.264
So, you know what,
that's enough about me.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.397
Now, I think you would rather
hear from the people

28:23.440 --> 28:25.268
you came here to see
in the first place.

28:25.312 --> 28:28.010
So without further ado, Kelly
and Donna, get on up here.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.188
Uh, before Kelly and I
do a set,

28:32.232 --> 28:35.235
we always sing the
Lambda Lambda Nu chantAlways.

28:35.278 --> 28:36.236
for good luck.

28:36.279 --> 28:38.064
And tonight,
we are lucky enough

28:38.107 --> 28:41.632
to have a fellow sister
with us to do that.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.895
Do you mind?

28:42.938 --> 28:44.287
We're gonna post it
to our social

28:44.331 --> 28:46.289
so every chapter can see it.You know what, though,

28:46.333 --> 28:48.291
I'm much more comfortablewith the handshake,

28:48.335 --> 28:49.771
so let's just dothe handshake.No.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.686
Y-You'll be fine.
Ready? On three. One...

28:51.730 --> 28:53.340

29:10.313 --> 29:12.011
That was so good!

29:12.054 --> 29:13.577
Okay...You're not one of us.

29:13.621 --> 29:16.406
No, I'm not. I'm not.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.060
I'm sorry.But I cannot tell a lie.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.845
At least not twice.What kind of person

29:19.888 --> 29:21.629
lies about beinga Lambda Lambda Nu?

29:21.672 --> 29:24.588
Well, the type of person
who was trying to impress you

29:24.632 --> 29:26.808
so that you would hopefully
play at my wedding.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.288
But you know what?But all the charity stuff,

29:28.331 --> 29:29.593
that was totally real.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.465
Fallon, did you just
read my speech

29:31.508 --> 29:34.076
and pretend you started
this project yourself?

29:35.643 --> 29:37.776
We are so not playing
your wedding.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.909
No! Not even "Lovelorn"?But that's Liam's favorite song.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.868
"Lovelorn" is not evenour song.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.608
That's the Kelly Sisters.

29:44.652 --> 29:45.696
Are you sure?

29:46.828 --> 29:48.438
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna...

29:57.447 --> 29:59.145
How-how was that
for an opening act?

29:59.188 --> 30:00.624
Um, uh, Kelly and I
will be right back

30:00.668 --> 30:02.801
with a killer, uh, performance.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.412
Um, just working out
some technical difficulties.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.113
I didn't realize
you'd actually be here

30:11.157 --> 30:12.506
when I said,
"See you at the gala."

30:12.549 --> 30:15.509
Wouldn't miss that car crash
we just saw.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.511
This hospital saved my life.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.818
Plus, I deeply enjoy
showing up at these events

30:19.861 --> 30:21.297
because it drives Blake insane.

30:21.341 --> 30:24.344
Not that I've seen
the bastard.

30:24.387 --> 30:25.954
I owe you an apology.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.827
I should have realizedyou wanted to be alone

30:28.870 --> 30:30.002
with Mia today,

30:30.045 --> 30:32.482
but I guess I was
feeling lonely.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.136
Apology accepted.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.530
And that apology goes
for last night, too.

30:36.573 --> 30:39.620
You wanted to go home, and I
just kept talking about Kirby,

30:39.663 --> 30:42.492
who has been avoiding me
all night.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.103
Up until 30 seconds ago,
so was I.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.019
Okay, okay, I-I get it.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.195
I need to listen more.
Read the room better.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.545
Don't tell me, tell Kirby.

30:51.588 --> 30:55.549
I will. I'll just have to
beg her forgiveness.

30:55.592 --> 30:58.508
Turns out galas aren't reallythat much fun when you're alone.

30:58.552 --> 31:01.120
Speaking of which,
where's your other half?

31:01.163 --> 31:04.775
I'll be straight with you.
Uh, my marriage is a...

31:04.819 --> 31:06.386
complicated arrangement.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.779
Isn't everything with Alexis?

31:08.823 --> 31:11.565
Seeing Mia last night
made me realize

31:11.608 --> 31:14.176
that part of the reason
I married Alexis

31:14.220 --> 31:15.961
is because I thought
I was dying.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.050
And now that I know
I'm not dying...

31:18.093 --> 31:19.312
You want to be with Mia.

31:19.355 --> 31:22.445
I don't know.

31:22.489 --> 31:24.056
But I do know I regret

31:24.099 --> 31:25.709
letting my friendship with her
fall apart.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.540
Dr. Bailey is much sexier
than I was expecting.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.760
She's still goingto the board.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.631
I did everything I couldto convince her,

31:34.675 --> 31:37.025
but once her mind's made up,there's nothing I can do.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.201
So you'll work at
another hospital.

31:39.245 --> 31:42.204
I don't know. Maybe I'm notmeant to be a doctor.

31:42.248 --> 31:43.640
Of course you are.

31:43.684 --> 31:45.294
Look, why don't
we go play darts?

31:45.338 --> 31:47.688
We can pretend that the
board is Dr. Bailey's head.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.690
I'd really ratherjust go home.

31:49.733 --> 31:52.519
I'll get our coats.I'll meet you out front?

31:52.562 --> 31:56.175
Thank you for coming.Have a good night.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.003
Great gala, Cristal.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.743
I'm glad someone had fun.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.745
I didn't. And it seemslike it was a disaster,

32:01.789 --> 32:04.313
but that's not whatI want to talk about.I don't have time for this.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.315
Oh, good, then
I'll make it quick.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.535
I know you're in favor
of Adam getting fired,

32:08.578 --> 32:10.972
but you're gonna use yourconnections, talk to Dr. Bailey,

32:11.016 --> 32:12.582
make sure that doesn't happen.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.236
And why would I do that?

32:14.280 --> 32:16.021
He's paying the price
for his actions.

32:16.064 --> 32:19.198
Huh. I'm just curious,
what's the price to pay

32:19.241 --> 32:21.635
for someone who commits adulterywith a priest?

32:24.203 --> 32:27.032
So glad we understand
each other.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.518
Not sure if "entertaining"is the right word,

32:35.562 --> 32:37.694
because it was alsoembarrassing.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.696
For me. I was,I was embarrassed for you.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.786
Right. Is this
your attempt at helping?

32:42.830 --> 32:44.614
Not at all.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.790
But I know where
your brain is going.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.444
And the only thing
that tonight proves

32:48.488 --> 32:50.794
is that you would make
a terrible sorority sister.

32:50.838 --> 32:54.276
It also proves that I knownothing about Liam.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.539
Not even his favorite band.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.979
Do you think this weddingis a huge mistake?

33:01.022 --> 33:02.806
This wasn't about
making Liam happy.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.026
This was about making you happy.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.375
No. If that were true,
I would've bought

33:06.419 --> 33:07.811
a silk Valentino jumpsuit.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.813
This was for Liam, you know?

33:09.857 --> 33:12.120
For him to realize
how much I love him.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.122
That shouldn't require
all this hoop-jumping.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.646
Not everything needs to be
such a huge production.

33:16.690 --> 33:17.908
Yeah, but that's what I do.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.823
You know,
big, dramatic statements

33:19.867 --> 33:22.652
that are unforgettableand put everyone else to shame.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.872
And don't forget how touched
you were by Liam's gift,

33:24.915 --> 33:26.874
and that was just
a piece of paper.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.658
Well, I'm assuming
that wasn't the whole gift.

33:28.702 --> 33:31.835
As long as Liam knows
you love him,

33:31.879 --> 33:33.707
that's all that really matters.

33:36.362 --> 33:39.017
Hey, Cristal,I-I'm so sorry about the whole

33:39.060 --> 33:41.758
stealing your speech thing, butyou were nowhere to be found.

33:41.802 --> 33:45.023
It's fine.That's the least of my problems.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.850
What is going on?

33:46.894 --> 33:52.030
Either Kelly or Donna atetoo many shrimp and is now sick.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.423
But since they're a duo,
one won't sing solo.

33:54.467 --> 33:57.035
And if there's
no performance,

33:57.078 --> 33:58.862
then people won't have
a good time, and if people

33:58.906 --> 34:01.213
don't have a good time,
then they won't donate money

34:01.256 --> 34:04.303
and this whole night will
have been for nothing.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.131
And you took offyour necklace.

34:07.175 --> 34:10.222
Yeah. You were right about it.

34:11.919 --> 34:16.271
Well, I owe you a favor.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.143
So let me see what I can do.

34:19.231 --> 34:21.059
DONNA:
I'm sorry,

34:21.102 --> 34:23.235
but Kelly doesn't feel up
to performing tonight.

34:23.278 --> 34:26.238
I hate to let everyone down,
but I can't sing a duet

34:26.281 --> 34:28.283
without the other half
of my duo.

34:28.327 --> 34:32.070
: Hey. Lucky for you,I can carry a tune pretty well.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.289
People came to this gala
to see me perform with Kelly.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.725
Not some lunatic

34:35.769 --> 34:37.510
who pretendsto be someone she's not.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.947
But people will be pretty upsetwhen they find out that Donna

34:39.990 --> 34:41.470
is short for prima donna

34:41.514 --> 34:43.559
and that you refused
to perform for a charity

34:43.603 --> 34:45.866
because your partner
OD'd on hors d'oeuvres.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.694
I also have a healthy
online following.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.435
Do you know
any of our actual songs?

34:49.478 --> 34:51.872
Uh, why don't we justgo with a classic?

34:51.915 --> 34:53.265
You know, just in case.

34:53.308 --> 34:55.136
DONNA:
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

34:55.180 --> 34:57.138
Fallon Carrington has agreed

34:57.182 --> 34:58.966
to sing with me tonight.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.143
And now it's time
for our gracious hosts,

35:02.187 --> 35:03.971

35:55.892 --> 35:59.766
that lobster toast with the
avocado and the fancy peppers.

35:59.809 --> 36:02.464
Yeah, I remember.
They were delicious.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.945
So delicious.

Thanks again for stepping in.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.656
You sounded great.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.658
Aw, well, it was
for a good cause.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.573
And you know,us Lambda Lambda Nus have to...

37:07.616 --> 37:08.878
Sorry.

37:08.922 --> 37:10.271
Habit.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.359
So I was thinking...Mm?

37:11.403 --> 37:12.665
I can talk to Kelly,

37:12.708 --> 37:14.188
see if she's upfor playing your wedding,

37:14.232 --> 37:16.321
since you filled in for her.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.366
Oh, well, you know
what? Since you guys

37:18.410 --> 37:20.716
weren't even the right
band, I'm actually good.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.936
But do you happen to
know the Kelly Sisters?

37:22.979 --> 37:25.417
Tell me that there's
some relation, or...?

37:25.460 --> 37:27.070
You guys all
hang out?

37:27.114 --> 37:29.072
I guess not.

37:29.116 --> 37:32.119
Only you could completely
humiliate yourself

37:32.162 --> 37:34.121
and still end up
winning the night.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.123
Well, like any skill,

37:36.166 --> 37:37.951
it only gets stronger
the more you practice.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.692
You know, maybe
if you used

37:39.735 --> 37:41.781
that skill for good, you might
know what to do for Liam.

37:41.824 --> 37:44.044
No, I do, I do. Thanks to you.

37:44.087 --> 37:47.569
I have decided I am going
to write Liam a song

37:47.613 --> 37:49.223
and perform it at the wedding.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.269
He will bea puddle at the end.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.314
Kind of like when John Legendwrote "All of Me"

37:53.358 --> 37:54.576
for Chrissy Teigen.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.969
Yeah.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.580
Maybe I should just getJohn Legend to write it.

37:58.624 --> 38:01.409
No, no, you're right.I'll write it myself.

38:01.453 --> 38:02.671
So thank you.Of course.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.847
Now I need a
favor from you.

38:04.891 --> 38:07.633
Dominique and Vanessa have beenusing me as a pawn for ratings.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.809
They faked a fight so Vanessa
could look like she was

38:09.852 --> 38:10.984
on team Culhane.

38:11.027 --> 38:12.725
Now I need to strike back.

38:12.768 --> 38:14.814
And there's only one name
that comes to mind

38:14.857 --> 38:16.381
when I think of revenge.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.252
Fallon? Aw!

38:18.296 --> 38:20.254
I'm flattered.
Thank you, Culhane.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.821
Now, the first thing

38:21.864 --> 38:23.823
you need to know about
revenge is that sometimes

38:23.866 --> 38:25.825
you got to play the long game.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.092
I finally figured out
what your text meant.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.354
What text?

38:33.398 --> 38:36.531
This one. "I-M-U-B."

38:36.575 --> 38:40.187
"I miss you, buddy."

38:40.230 --> 38:42.102
That was an accidental text.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.496
IMUB doesn't
mean anything.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.281
You're reading into something
that literally means nothing.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.067
Oh, well, it meanssomething to me.

38:51.111 --> 38:55.071
Because IMU... B.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.899
We haven't talkedin two days,

38:56.943 --> 38:59.685
which is, like,forever in us time.

38:59.728 --> 39:00.903
And I don't want to lose you.

39:00.947 --> 39:04.124
So I am just gonna relax

39:04.167 --> 39:07.257
while we rekindle
our friendship.

39:07.301 --> 39:08.824
What are you wearing?

39:08.868 --> 39:11.784
An itchy polyester blend T-shirtof a band I don't even know.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.221
That's how much I love you.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.049
And we should watch the concert.

39:16.092 --> 39:19.269
It's livestreaming
from Australia.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.446
I know.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.449
That's why I'm here,
not in Adam's loft.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.321
Also, he's in a bad mood.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.281
Thanks for this.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.719
IMUB, too.

39:33.762 --> 39:36.591
I promise I'll be
a better listener.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.466
Okay.

39:41.509 --> 39:45.383
You better start now, because
I have some very juicy gossip.

39:47.036 --> 39:49.822
What did we do?

39:49.865 --> 39:54.827
You broke your
vows, I broke mine.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.874
You said our kiss
was a mistake.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.575
Yeah, well, we make mistakes.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.446
We're only human.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.640
Hmm. Hello?

40:25.684 --> 40:26.989
Want to come over?

40:27.033 --> 40:28.208
:It's Adam.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.427
Booty call.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.254
Here.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.257
Um, I can't.I'm watching a concert.

40:34.301 --> 40:37.130
Watch it later.I'm in the mood for celebrating.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.959
Bailey left a message.
She changed her mind.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.222
See? I focused on being good,
and it paid off.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.137
Sometimes karma isn't a bitch.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.921
Wow, I'm so happy for you.

40:45.965 --> 40:47.488
Maybe someonein a more forgiving mood

40:47.532 --> 40:50.056
heard about your little problemand had a chat with her.

40:50.099 --> 40:51.884
Anyway, I, um,

40:51.927 --> 40:53.451
I can't come over right now,

40:53.494 --> 40:55.322
'cause I'm gonna spendsome time with my friend.

40:55.365 --> 40:56.715
Aw.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.544
Um, but if you stay uplate enough,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.850
Sam usually falls asleeparound midnight.

41:06.376 --> 41:08.378
Hello?

41:11.381 --> 41:12.731
Um...

41:17.866 --> 41:20.826
Cristal.Adam, what are you doing here?

41:20.869 --> 41:22.480
Blake's pilot just called.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.307
He and Anders had some trouble
with the government

41:24.351 --> 41:28.790
at the Moldavian airport,
and apparently,

41:28.834 --> 41:30.618
they've been kidnapped.

41:30.662 --> 41:32.664
What?

41:38.278 --> 41:41.237
