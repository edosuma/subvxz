WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:22.788 --> 01:25.655
Mayday, Mayday.
Can anyone hear me?

01:27.392 --> 01:30.919
This is Lieutenant Marlena
Glenn of the Earth probe, Valiant.

01:31.263 --> 01:34.357
I've been caught in a cosmic
storm and swept off course.

01:34.633 --> 01:35.930
Does anyone copy?

01:38.337 --> 01:42.398
Well, Marlena, old girl,
you're on your own this time.

01:42.741 --> 01:47.542
A million miles from home, and stuck
in the middle of an asteroid shower.

01:47.946 --> 01:51.143
If I don't find shelter soon,
I'll be smashed to space dust.

01:53.352 --> 01:56.287
My sensors indicate
a small planet ahead.

01:56.588 --> 01:57.953
No telling what's down there...

01:58.290 --> 02:00.656
I'll just cross my fingers,
and hope for the best.

02:01.260 --> 02:02.260
Here goes nothing.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.943
So thats how you
came to land on Eternia?

02:22.247 --> 02:25.216
Yes, and I can see it all again.

02:25.551 --> 02:27.746
Thanks to Man-At-Arms memory projector.

02:28.053 --> 02:29.748
Well, you were some pilot, Mother.

02:33.225 --> 02:35.557
[chuckles] That was a long time ago.

02:35.961 --> 02:37.929
Mom, what was Earth like?

02:38.430 --> 02:41.126
I'm afraid you would find
it kind of boring, Adam.

02:41.567 --> 02:44.593
There are no giant green
tigers, or magical castles.

02:44.970 --> 02:49.066
But it is a beautiful
place, filled with beautiful people.

02:49.408 --> 02:50.898
Sounds as if you miss it.

02:51.276 --> 02:52.538
Sometimes.

02:56.081 --> 03:00.313
But my real home here, on
Eternia, with you and your father.

03:00.686 --> 03:04.053
I wouldn't trade anything for
the life we ​​have together.

03:06.858 --> 03:10.157
Excuse me, Your Highness,
but I was looking for Adam.

03:10.462 --> 03:11.462
Uh oh.

03:11.797 --> 03:14.595
Of course.
I'll see you later.

03:22.107 --> 03:23.972
And where were you this afternoon?

03:24.309 --> 03:25.435
Well, I uh...

03:25.844 --> 03:29.405
I thought you agreed to run for
some combat maneuvers with me.

03:29.681 --> 03:31.911
I did? Oh, yeah, I did.

03:32.150 --> 03:33.845
But I got so busy
this morning, that...

03:34.152 --> 03:35.152
Really?

03:35.153 --> 03:36.780
Let's see how busy you were.

03:37.055 --> 03:38.249
Hey... don't.

03:43.362 --> 03:45.853
Aren't you ashamed of yourself.

03:46.932 --> 03:49.298
yeah,
I didn't catch a thing.

03:49.835 --> 03:51.427
See you on the drilling field.

04:18.397 --> 04:20.365
Oh boy, it's almost done.

04:23.802 --> 04:26.498
Wait till they see this, they'll love it.

04:33.278 --> 04:36.770
I thought I heard someone
fooling around in my workshop.

04:37.582 --> 04:39.181
I'm not fooling around, Man-At-Arms.

04:39.251 --> 04:41.617
I'm making a surprise
for the king and queen.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.467
The last surprise you gave them,

04:43.492 --> 04:45.038
nearly burned down the castle.

04:45.290 --> 04:47.190
I'm afraid to ak what this on does.

04:47.492 --> 04:49.187
It's a music box, of course.

04:49.428 --> 04:50.900
Just lift the lid and it

04:50.925 --> 04:52.580
plays a beautiful melody.

04:57.869 --> 04:59.336
Where did you get
the parts for this?

04:59.571 --> 05:01.232
Over in that crate, why?

05:03.008 --> 05:06.500
Thats where we keep the bomb parts.
This thing's going to explode.

05:06.778 --> 05:08.006
Yikes!

05:20.425 --> 05:21.585
Big explosion.

05:21.860 --> 05:24.556
If I told you once,
I told you a million times...

05:24.796 --> 05:26.627
stay out of my workroom.

05:28.467 --> 05:30.526
Oh well, back to the old drawing board.

05:37.876 --> 05:39.070
What's Orko upto?

05:39.344 --> 05:40.606
Mischief, as usual.

05:40.846 --> 05:44.111
He almost wrecked the palace,
with another of his crazy inventions.

05:51.156 --> 05:55.456
Speaking of inventions, your memory
projector made a big hit with the queen.

05:55.727 --> 05:56.727
Good.

05:56.862 --> 05:58.625
Our queen is quite a woman.

05:58.997 --> 06:01.192
Adam's lucky to have here for a mother.

06:02.033 --> 06:04.729
She makes me wonder about my own parents.

06:06.071 --> 06:07.504
I've told you, Teela.

06:07.873 --> 06:10.967
Your father was one of the
greatest men I ever knew.

06:11.276 --> 06:14.973
He gave his life in battle so
Eternians could live in peace.

06:15.514 --> 06:18.347
It was honored to adopt
you as my own daughter.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.583
And my mother?

06:19.985 --> 06:22.852
That is a secret I
promised never to reveal.

06:23.188 --> 06:26.487
Some day you will learn that secret, Teela.
Not from me.

06:34.166 --> 06:37.624
Even as a little girl,
I have no memory of my mother...

06:37.869 --> 06:41.168
only of Man-At-Arms,
who was always there for me.

06:43.275 --> 06:46.972
He raised me alone, teaching me
both the skills of a warrior...

06:47.212 --> 06:50.045
and the manners of the royal court.

06:50.448 --> 06:54.441
And because of his love and
guidance, I excelled at both.

06:55.954 --> 06:58.422
But as to who my mother was or is...

06:59.024 --> 07:00.992
I have no idea.

07:04.996 --> 07:06.554
Why the long face, Teela?

07:06.832 --> 07:08.959
Did Cringer use your shield
as a water-dish again?

07:09.301 --> 07:13.101
No, Orko, I was just remembering
back to when I was a little girl.

07:14.072 --> 07:15.505
Bad memories?

07:15.907 --> 07:18.000
No memories, is more like it.

07:18.276 --> 07:21.074
If only I could see what
happened before I was born...

07:21.379 --> 07:24.439
Maybe if I were to ask the
Oracle of the Crystal Sea.

07:24.683 --> 07:26.981
The Oracle?
No, Teela.

07:27.452 --> 07:29.317
It's too dangerous.

07:29.621 --> 07:31.316
I've got to take that chance.

07:31.656 --> 07:35.456
But the Oracle's cave is surrounded
by shadow beasts and monsters.

07:35.794 --> 07:37.659
You can't go alone?!

07:38.530 --> 07:39.758
I have to.

07:40.065 --> 07:42.625
And you mustn't tell anyone
where I've gone, Orko.

07:42.968 --> 07:45.198
But the Crystal Sea, Teela?

07:45.437 --> 07:48.406
I know, but I'd risk
anything to learn the truth.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.287
Oh, Teela's sure in a hurry.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.828
Yes and it's not like her to run off alone.

08:12.130 --> 08:14.655
Don't worry,
Teela can look out for herself.

08:15.033 --> 08:16.033
I hope.

08:16.034 --> 08:17.334
Do you know where she's going, Orko?

08:17.335 --> 08:18.802
I promised not to tell. After all...

08:19.137 --> 08:22.436
If Teela wants to go running off to
the Crystal Sea, that's her business.

08:23.308 --> 08:25.105
The Crystal Sea?

08:25.410 --> 08:26.410
Whoops.

08:26.678 --> 08:28.976
Even Teela is no match for
the evil creatures there.

08:31.449 --> 08:33.610
Orko, you should have stopped her.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.510
I tried, I tried.

08:36.054 --> 08:38.181
Cringer, we've got to find her.

08:39.124 --> 08:43.686
Don't tell me I have to be
that dreadful Battle Cat again.

08:43.995 --> 08:47.192
Sorry old cat, but he could stay on
Teela's trail better than you could.

08:47.766 --> 08:49.961
By the power of Grayskull.

08:56.174 --> 08:59.632
I have the power!

09:26.237 --> 09:31.436
How interesting. The woman
Teela is off on some mission of her own.

09:31.776 --> 09:34.336
She's bound for the Crystal Sea...

09:34.646 --> 09:36.705
your home territory, Mer-Man.

09:36.982 --> 09:41.351
I beg you, Skeletor. Let me deal with her.

09:41.653 --> 09:46.818
Years ago, her guardian, Man-At-Arms,
rescued a victim I had chosen...

09:47.125 --> 09:51.061
for the Sea Demon and now demand revenge.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.630
So be it.

10:08.413 --> 10:11.143
Thats not the prettiest
place I've ever been.

10:11.449 --> 10:14.317
But, I, didn't exactly
come here for a vacation.

10:26.164 --> 10:27.495
A shadow beast!

10:27.966 --> 10:30.127
I'd hate to meet one of those monsters.

10:58.496 --> 11:02.330
The only thing these beasts fear is
the bright light, so...

11:10.308 --> 11:12.367
And now, back to business.

11:16.347 --> 11:19.976
We're almost at the Crystal Sea.
I hope Teela's safe.

11:29.894 --> 11:32.863
That's it! The Oracle's Cave.

11:37.669 --> 11:39.398
Approach the altar.

11:40.238 --> 11:42.672
My name is Teela, I've come...

11:42.907 --> 11:44.067
I know why you are here.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.400
You have come seeking your past.

11:46.744 --> 11:50.874
A past, that only I can make clear.
Behold, Teela.

11:52.550 --> 11:53.812
Do you know him?

11:54.152 --> 11:56.484
Yes, it's Man-At-Arms, as a young warrior.

11:57.155 --> 11:59.123
Years ago, your adopted father...

11:59.457 --> 12:01.982
was making his way through
the Evergreen Forest.

12:02.327 --> 12:05.387
He had received a strange
psychic signal...

12:05.730 --> 12:08.255
drawing him urgently
through the woods.

12:08.533 --> 12:11.696
Then suddenly a sound reached his ears.

12:12.036 --> 12:13.765
It was the cry of a falcon.

12:18.309 --> 12:22.006
Mer-Man and his subjects had
come to capture Zoar, the falcon.

12:22.447 --> 12:25.848
They intended to sacrifice the
mystic bird to an evil sea demon.

12:26.518 --> 12:29.282
It would have been easy for
the falcon to have flown away.

12:29.621 --> 12:32.419
But there was something in
the nest she was protecting.

12:32.690 --> 12:36.786
Something she'd give
her very life to defend.

13:06.791 --> 13:09.453
Mer-Man had been defeated.

13:09.794 --> 13:12.854
But he swore to some day get
even with the young warrior.

13:14.332 --> 13:16.926
The warrior looked
into the nest and saw.

13:19.704 --> 13:21.296
Wait!  Why did you stop?

13:21.639 --> 13:22.765
I sense...

13:23.141 --> 13:25.268
evil coming closer.

13:25.610 --> 13:28.272
Beware, Teela.  Beware.

13:28.780 --> 13:30.042
Fish Men!

13:35.820 --> 13:38.015
I know Teela can take care of herself...

13:38.289 --> 13:40.457
but I can't shake the feeling,
she's headed for danger.

13:43.294 --> 13:45.159
After all these years...

13:45.463 --> 13:48.057
the daughter of my old
enemy, Man-At-Arms...

13:48.366 --> 13:50.994
has finally fallen into my hands.

13:51.302 --> 13:53.702
If it's a rematch you want, toad face...

13:54.072 --> 13:57.303
Cut me loose. I'll give you
one you won't forget.

13:58.142 --> 14:00.838
I have other plans for you girl.

14:01.111 --> 14:04.672
A very special destiny,

14:04.938 --> 14:06.438
for you to fulfill.

14:12.090 --> 14:15.253
So when He-Man and Battle
Cat ran off to find Teela...

14:15.560 --> 14:18.723
I thought I'd tell you too.
Seemed important to me.

14:19.097 --> 14:21.463
More important than you realise, Orko.

14:23.368 --> 14:28.772
To Teela's side I go, on falcon's wings.

14:34.245 --> 14:37.078
Wow, she sure knows how to make an exit.

14:39.517 --> 14:41.485
Teela!  You are here?

14:43.655 --> 14:46.522
Easy! Easy, great cat! Easy!

14:46.758 --> 14:48.191
The Oracle means us no harm.

14:48.526 --> 14:51.552
He-Man,
your friend Teela is in danger.

14:51.796 --> 14:53.593
She has been captured by Mer-Man.

14:58.903 --> 15:01.929
You've picked up their trail eh? Let's go.

15:07.845 --> 15:12.873
Once every 20 years,
the stars come into perfect alignment.

15:13.217 --> 15:17.677
That is the time, Bakkull may be summoned
from its underwater slumber,

15:17.955 --> 15:20.253
with this, the Crimson Pearl.

15:20.558 --> 15:21.957
Who is this Bakkull?

15:22.827 --> 15:24.351
And what do you want with me?

15:24.729 --> 15:29.189
Whoever commands the Crimson
Pearl also commands Bakkull...

15:29.600 --> 15:31.761
mightiest of sea demons.

15:32.170 --> 15:35.230
But Bakkull demands a
sacrifice for its services.

15:36.174 --> 15:40.907
Twenty years ago, your father
rescued a victim I had selected.

15:41.279 --> 15:44.771
How fitting,
that you should now take her place.

15:47.085 --> 15:49.053
Let us summon Bakkull!

15:49.487 --> 15:51.318
Hold it, fish face.

15:52.957 --> 15:55.858
He-Man! Stop them, you fools.

15:58.463 --> 16:01.091
I must complete the spell.

16:04.936 --> 16:08.702
Now, Bakkull, hear my command!

16:09.173 --> 16:12.734
Come forth, and serve the
master of the Crimson Pearl.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.574
Better let me handle this, Cat.

16:20.785 --> 16:22.946
Your claws weren't made
for climbing crystal.

16:23.888 --> 16:25.719
I think we could use a tunnel.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.252
Thats just what I was thinking.

16:42.573 --> 16:45.235
Boy, the things people keep lying around.

16:56.654 --> 17:02.115
Now, Bakkull,
take your offering and serve me well.

17:03.628 --> 17:04.627
No!

17:07.265 --> 17:09.256
Teela, use my sword!

17:12.537 --> 17:14.436
Stay back, monster!

17:18.108 --> 17:20.134
As long as Mer-Man holds
the red pearl...

17:20.478 --> 17:21.740
That monster is unstoppable.

17:22.046 --> 17:23.734
Get them both!

17:24.015 --> 17:27.541
Obey your master and destroy them.

17:35.861 --> 17:36.861
No!

17:36.894 --> 17:37.986
The Pearl!

17:38.162 --> 17:41.063
The Pearl was the only
thing controlling Bakkull.

17:41.332 --> 17:43.459
Help me, help me!

17:52.644 --> 17:53.644
Help-me.

17:56.881 --> 17:59.145
I may hate my self later, but...

17:59.604 --> 18:00.604
Alley-oop!

18:02.820 --> 18:05.050
Thanks for the rescue, fool.

18:05.490 --> 18:08.152
Now see if you can save yourself.

18:26.978 --> 18:28.104
Sorry, big fella...

18:37.989 --> 18:41.390
Well, let's hope this'll hold
Bakull for another 20 years.

18:42.126 --> 18:44.526
You risked everything
to go back for Mer-Man.

18:44.762 --> 18:45.762
Anyone...

18:45.930 --> 18:47.898
even an evil one is worth saving.

18:48.132 --> 18:49.224
Now, let's go home.

18:49.634 --> 18:50.828
Wait, He-Man.

18:51.202 --> 18:53.170
There is one more thing I have to do.

18:55.339 --> 18:58.570
Oh Oracle, finish your tale.
Tell me of my mother.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.367
Young Man-At-Arms had driven off Mer-Man...

19:01.679 --> 19:03.909
and made his way to the falcon's nest.

19:04.282 --> 19:07.183
Inside the nest was
a baby girl...

19:07.451 --> 19:08.982
It was the Sorceress' young daughter.

19:09.186 --> 19:10.551
With the passing of her husband...

19:10.988 --> 19:14.389
she had brought the little child to the
mountain to raise her in peace.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.692
But after Mer-Man's attack...

19:17.061 --> 19:19.188
the falcon knew that without a real home...

19:19.530 --> 19:21.691
her baby would never be truly safe.

19:22.066 --> 19:24.762
The young warrior's heart
went out to the child...

19:25.036 --> 19:27.061
and promised to take care
for her, all his days.

19:27.438 --> 19:29.497
You are that child, Teela.

19:29.874 --> 19:32.843
That means my mother is... the Sorceress,

19:33.611 --> 19:34.611
of Grayskull.

19:35.479 --> 19:37.106
-Mother? -Yes.

19:37.481 --> 19:40.006
You are my own daughter...

19:40.384 --> 19:43.683
And some day, you will take my place.

19:44.088 --> 19:47.285
As the Mystic Guardian of Grayskull.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.957
But for now you have other deeds to do...

19:50.361 --> 19:53.592
and until that time when
your special destiny calls...

19:53.931 --> 19:56.798
you must forget what
you have learned today.

19:59.103 --> 20:04.905
She will only remember that her mother
was a woman who loved her very much.

20:05.309 --> 20:08.176
I'll leave her secret with you, He-Man.

20:08.779 --> 20:11.839
You can I assume, keep a secret.

20:12.183 --> 20:13.912
I've had lots of practice.

20:31.936 --> 20:34.700
In today's story,
I went in search of my mother.

20:35.106 --> 20:37.199
I found her,
but I also found something else;

20:37.541 --> 20:39.771
that the man who had cared
for me since I was a baby...

20:40.111 --> 20:41.976
who loved me as he would
his own daughter...

20:42.313 --> 20:44.713
was just as much my father
as any parent could be.

20:45.082 --> 20:47.021
And so whether they are
someone we were born to,

20:47.046 --> 20:48.769
or whether they chose us to adopt...

20:49.086 --> 20:50.212
it doesn't matter.

20:50.488 --> 20:53.048
The ones who protect us,
and teach us, and love us...

20:53.290 --> 20:55.082
they are the ones we
call mother and father.

20:55.292 --> 20:58.022
And they deserve the same
kind of love from us.

20:58.329 --> 20:59.329
Until next time.
