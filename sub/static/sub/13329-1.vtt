01:04.898 --> 01:07.135
THEY CALLED ME TO SAY
THAT YOU STOLE A CUSHION.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.869

01:08.969 --> 01:11.939
- YES.

STEAL CUSHIONS.

01:12.039 --> 01:13.574
NO, THIS IS
A REALLY NICE CUSHION.

01:13.674 --> 01:16.577
RETURN IT, OKAY?
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
YOU'D FEEL BAD

01:16.677 --> 01:18.212
IF YOU LIVED WITH THAT
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.114
EVERY TIME
SOMEONE CAME AROUND,
"OH, NICE CUSHION."

01:20.214 --> 01:22.716

01:22.816 --> 01:26.420

- CRAZY DOGGGZ...
- "DEAR MURRAY,

01:42.636 --> 01:44.872
WE WANT TO FIRE YOU
AS OUR MANAGER."

01:44.972 --> 01:46.774
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

01:48.942 --> 01:52.079
- WHAT'S YOUR REASONING, BRET?
- YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME
ON THE CRAZY DOGGGZ

01:52.180 --> 01:54.648
AND YOU DON'T REALLY SPEND
ANY TIME ON US.

01:54.748 --> 01:58.252
BEFORE YOU CAME
TO ME, YOU WERE POOR
AND YOU HAD NO GIGS.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.454
- NOW LOOK AT YOU.
- WE'RE POOR AND WE'VE
GOT NO GIGS.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.823
- WE'RE SLIGHTLY POORER.
- ARE YOU REALLY?

02:02.923 --> 02:04.458
YEAH, BRET'S ONLY
GOT ONE SHOE.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.861
OH, BRET, IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT? ONE SHOE?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.797
- I CAN GET YOU ANOTHER SHOE.
- NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHOE.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.832
- I JUST LOST MY SHOE.
- NOT A PROBLEM.
WHAT SIZE ARE YOU?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.867
- SIZE 9, BUT IT'S
NOT ABOUT THE SHOE.
- GET YOU ANOTHER SHOE.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.404
- IT'S ABOUT...
- YOUR RIGHT FOOT.
YEAH, HI. MURRAY HERE.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.740
- I NEED A RIGHT-FOOT SHOE.
- MURRAY, WE'RE FIRING YOU.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.210
WE'RE GONNA
MANAGE OURSELVES.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.513
RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND IT.
OKAY, FINE.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.616
YOU KNOW WHAT? ACTUALLY,
THERE'S ANOTHER ITEM
HERE ON THE AGENDA

02:28.716 --> 02:30.218

OH YES, HERE IT IS.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.186
ITEM FOUR:
STUFF YOU.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.654

02:33.754 --> 02:36.824
STUFF YOU, JEMAINE,
AND STUFF YOU, BRET.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.426
AND STUFF YOU AGAIN,
JEMAINE.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.261
WHY DID I GET
DOUBLE STUFFED?

02:40.361 --> 02:42.696
I DON'T NEED YOU GUYS.
YOU'RE UNNEEDED, OKAY?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.399
I'VE GOT THE CRAZY DOGGGZ.
THEY'RE MAKING HIT AFTER HIT.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.336
"DOGGY BOUNCE," NUMBER ONE.
"DOGGY DANCE," NUMBER FIVE.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.770
"IN THE POUND,"
NUMBER 37.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.839
IT'S NOT GONNA STOP.
IT'S NEVER GONNA STOP.

02:51.939 --> 02:55.709
THEY'RE A HIT-MAKING MACHINE.
LOOK AT THEIR GOLD RECORDS!

02:55.809 --> 02:58.512
AND JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
YOUR WALL-- IT'S OVER THERE--

02:58.612 --> 03:01.515
THEY'RE FAKE.
I HAD TO MAKE THEM MYSELF.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.317
- WHAT?

SHARPENERS STUCK

03:03.417 --> 03:05.219
TO A COUPLE
OF BITS OF WOOD
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.555
- WE DIDN'T WIN THE GRAMMYS?
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.557
I THOUGHT WE WON
"BEST NEW ZEALAND ARTISTS."

03:09.657 --> 03:11.459
THERE'S NO SUCH
CATEGORY, JEMAINE.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.127
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
"BEST MANAGEMENT" AWARD?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.364
THAT'S FAKE AS WELL.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.766
WE'RE GOING, MURRAY.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.608
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS

06:14.708 --> 06:15.909
I USED TO DO BEHIND
THE SCENES, ALL RIGHT?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.678
STUFF THAT YOU GUYS
DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.747
WHAT, WHEN WE COULDN'T
SEE YOU?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.815
- YEAH.

BEHIND THE SCENES?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.651

06:37.197 --> 06:39.533
I THOUGHT TONIGHT'S
GIG WENT REALLY WELL.
WE HAD A BIG CROWD.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.235

BUT IT'S THE KIND
OF ACCIDENT I LIKE TO BE IN.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.458
WE THINK YOU'D BE PERFECT
TO WRITE A NEW JINGLE

07:04.558 --> 07:06.594
FOR A CAMPAIGN
WE'RE DOING.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.929
OH, WE DON'T
USE OUR MUSIC
TO SELL PRODUCTS.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.498
- ( sighs )
- MMM.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.299
THIS COULD MAKE YOU SO RICH
YOU'LL BE SHITTING MONEY.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.768
LITERALLY IF YOU WANTED.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.437
- HMM.

A MEETING ABOUT THIS.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.172

07:57.210 --> 07:59.379
I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.715
LET'S DO IT.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.888
WE'VE DECIDED WE'D LIKE

08:14.962 --> 08:17.698
- WOMEN ONLY.
- NOT MANY PEOPLE
KNOW THIS,

08:17.798 --> 08:20.333
BUT WOMEN HAVE
VERY DIFFERENT
DENTAL NEEDS FROM MEN.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.770
- WE DO.
- COULD I TRY SOME?

08:22.870 --> 08:26.006
UM, I DON'T THINK SO.
IT'S REALLY FOR WOMEN ONLY.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.975
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
IS THINK ABOUT IT,

08:28.075 --> 08:30.310
BECAUSE WHEN I SAW
YOU GUYS TONIGHT,

08:30.410 --> 08:31.779
I THOUGHT,
"HERE'S TWO MEN

08:31.879 --> 08:34.181
WHO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WOMEN FEEL LIKE."

08:34.281 --> 08:36.483
- THANK YOU.

08:36.584 --> 08:39.219
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT, HERE.

OH. YES.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.037
( acoustic rock music
playing )

09:00.674 --> 09:02.876
WHAT DO WOMEN LIKE?

09:02.976 --> 09:04.344
MEN?

09:04.444 --> 09:07.547
- SOME OF THEM DO.
- YEAH.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.584
* SOME WOMEN LIKE MEN

09:10.684 --> 09:13.120
* SOME ARE LESBIAN

09:13.220 --> 09:16.189
* FEMIDENT TOOTHPASTE.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.526
IT'S--
THERE'S ALMOST HALF.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.363
- THAT'S HALF OF IT.
- WOMEN LOVE WEAVING.
THEY LOVE TO WEAVE.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.966
NAH. WEAVING IS
A MAN'S GAME.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.001
BRET...

09:28.101 --> 09:31.471
YOU PUT A WOMAN IN FRONT
OF A WEAVING MACHINE

09:31.571 --> 09:33.373
AND JUST WATCH HER GO.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.342
NO, HONESTLY,
MY DAD WEAVES.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.779
- MY GRANDFATHER WAS A WEAVER.
- I THOUGHT YOUR DAD WAS
A SHEEP LAWYER.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.548
YEAH, DURING THE DAY,
BUT AT NIGHT HE WEAVES A LOT.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.017
I COME FROM A FAMILY
OF WEAVERS.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.620
- I'VE NEVER
SEEN A MAN WEAVE.
- I LOVE WEAVING.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.991
I'M WEAVING AT THE MOMENT,
MAKING A PAIR OF TROUSERS.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.694
- WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
- NO, THAT'S MORE
OF A MAN'S THING, ISN'T IT?

09:53.794 --> 09:57.631
- SORRY ABOUT--
- UM, NO, DEFINITELY
A WOMAN'S THING.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.333
NAH, MY FATHER'S
A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.802
- YOUR DAD?
- YEAH.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.437
- NOT YOUR MOM?
- NO. MOM-- NO.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.607
DAD WOULDN'T
ALLOW THAT. NO WAY.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.110
THEY LIKE WRESTLING
IN COOKING OIL ON A PLANE.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.680
SEEMS LIKE A RIDICULOUS
GENERALIZATION.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.782
NO, THESE WOMEN I MET,

10:14.882 --> 10:17.584
I TOOK THEM UP ON A PLANE,
THEY WERE MAKING A SALAD,

10:17.685 --> 10:20.788
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE JUST WRESTLING
AT 85,000 FEET.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.090
DO YOU KNOW
ANY ACTUAL WOMEN, DAVE?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.693
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.494
YOU SAID THERE
WOULD BE A LOT
OF WOMEN HERE TODAY.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.497
THERE USUALLY IS, JEMAINE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.700
THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST DOING BRAZILIANS.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.002
THEY'LL SHOW UP.
DON'T WORRY.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.641
- Murray:
OH, HEY, GUYS. COME IN.
- Bret: HEY, MURRAY.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.378
WELL, BASICALLY,
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.180
SEE HOW YOU GUYS
WERE GETTING ON.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.216
- IT'S NOT AS EASY--
IS IT? --WITHOUT ME
- IT'S A BIT EASIER.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.218
- IT'S REAL EASY.
- WHAT?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.787
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE EASIER.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.455
SO YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE EASY

10:55.555 --> 10:56.924
AND IT'S EVEN EASIER
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.492
- IT'S EASIER THAN EASY.
- OH, OKAY, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME

10:59.592 --> 11:01.862
IT WAS
UNBELIEVABLY EASY.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.331
YEAH, WE'RE DOING A JINGLE
FOR A TOOTHPASTE AD.

11:04.431 --> 11:08.101
AH. LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
THESE ADVERTISING PEOPLE
ARE LIKE, BRET. OKAY?

11:08.201 --> 11:12.172
I'VE BEEN TO BANGKOK.
NOW MONDAY YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO A TV COMMERCIAL,

11:12.272 --> 11:13.974
THEY'RE FILMING IT,
IT'S ALL ABOUT TOOTHPASTE,

11:14.074 --> 11:16.309
THEN TUESDAY THEY'RE TRYING
TO FILM YOU NAKED.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.713
YUP. NEXT THING
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING
DRUGS THROWN AT YOU

11:19.813 --> 11:21.815
AND ALL BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE
PROPER MANAGEMENT.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.318
- HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, GUYS.
- WELL, IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MURRAY.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.620
- WE'RE GONNA--
- WE'VE GOT TO
WRITE A JINGLE.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.824
LOOK, JUST HANG ON, OKAY?
NOW, DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
PROFESSIONAL OPINIONS ARE?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.392
- Both: YES.
- YOU DO? OKAY.
DO YOU HAVE THEM?

11:32.492 --> 11:33.794
- YES.
- YEAH.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.562
GOOD, 'CAUSE I NEED SOME.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.230
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.267
- * BOUNCE BOUNCE,
DOGGY BOUNCE... *
- OH YEAH.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.135
I CAN'T STAND
THIS SONG.

11:42.235 --> 11:46.073
LOOK AT THAT.
OKAY, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.875
NOW LOOK AT THIS.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.744
( singing "Doggy Bounce"
in Polish )

11:56.884 --> 11:59.386
OKAY?
NOW, OPINION TIME.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.923
IS THAT ONE IN ANY WAY
SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE?

12:03.023 --> 12:06.059
YES, IN THAT IT IS
EXACTLY THE SAME.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.962
- YEAH, IT'S VERY SIMILAR.
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY
IT'S SIMILAR--

12:09.062 --> 12:11.965
BECAUSE THIS POLISH ONE
IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS
A COVER VERSION.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.102
OKAY?
NOW THE ONLY
PROBLEM IS

12:15.202 --> 12:17.304
THIS COVER VERSION
CAME OUT 13 YEARS

12:17.404 --> 12:19.206
BEFORE THE CRAZY DOGGGZ'S
ORIGINAL VERSION.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.975
- MMM.
- SO MY QUESTION
TO YOU IS:

12:22.075 --> 12:26.279
IS THAT BAD?
OR DO YOU THINK
THAT'S NORMAL?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.248
I THINK
IT'S PROBABLY BAD.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.184
OKAY. WELL, THAT'S WHAT
THE LAWYER SAID.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.853
I'VE GOT TWO BADS.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.022
WHAT ABOUT YOU, BRET?
DO YOU THINK THAT'S BAD?

12:35.122 --> 12:37.791
- MMM. BAD.
- NORMAL?

12:37.891 --> 12:39.726
- BAD.
- YOU THINK THAT'S--

12:39.827 --> 12:41.929
- I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BAD.
- YOU THINK THAT'S NORMAL,
DO YOU?

12:42.029 --> 12:43.763
- I THINK IT'S BAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.099
SO I'VE GOT--
SO YOU'RE NORMAL--

12:46.199 --> 12:47.700
- NO, I'M BAD.
- YOU'RE BAD?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.502
- MM-HMM.
- I'VE GOT THREE--

12:49.602 --> 12:53.373
EXCUSE ME, I SAID WAIT
UNTIL THE MEETING'S
FINISHED, PLEASE.

12:53.473 --> 12:57.177
EXCUSE ME.
CAREFUL WITH THAT.
THAT'S WORTH $20,000.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.079
IT WAS A GIFT
FROM TORI AMOS.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.882
- ARE YOU
MOVING OFFICE, MURRAY?
- I'M KIND OF MOVING.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.618
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO ITEM THREE:

13:05.718 --> 13:09.923
UH, WOULD ANY OF YOU
LIKE TO BUY A DESK?

13:10.023 --> 13:13.326
( crowd booing )
CRAZY DOGGGZ, WE'RE ONTO YOU!

13:13.426 --> 13:15.528
( Mel yelling )

13:15.628 --> 13:18.665
YOU RUINED HIS LIFE!

13:18.765 --> 13:20.934
OH, HEY, GUYS!

13:22.535 --> 13:24.905
HEY, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS
CRAZY DOGGGZ CONTROVERSY?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.539
THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT, RIGHT?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.241
- HEY, DOUG.
- Mel: YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN DOUG

13:28.341 --> 13:30.310
- WHEN HE HEARD
WHAT HAPPENED.
- HEY.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.279
- HE WENT BERSERK.
- Jemaine: REALLY?

13:32.379 --> 13:34.814
ACTUALLY, MEL REALLY WENT
MORE SORT OF BERSERK.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.617
OH, STOP HOGGING
THE CONVERSATION,
DOUG. IT'S RUDE.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.287
- IT IS RUDE.
- I WASN'T-- BUT I WASN'T
REALLY HOGGING

13:40.387 --> 13:42.255
CONVERSATION HOG.
"OINK OINK OINK OINK.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.557
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY ALL THE TIME."

13:44.657 --> 13:46.860
( laughs )
HE'S ALWAYS TALKING.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.429
ARE WE GOING TO LIGHT
THIS FIRE OR WHAT?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.798
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S AGAINST CITY LAWS

13:51.899 --> 13:53.800
TO START A FIRE
ON THE SIDEWALK.

13:53.901 --> 13:57.737
- Mel: OH MY GOD, DOUG.
- HEY, GOOD LUCK WITH
THE CD BURNING.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.240
HAND ME THAT
GASOLINE CAN,
ALL RIGHT?

14:00.340 --> 14:03.310
'CAUSE LOOKS LIKE
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
DO THIS BY MYSELF,

14:03.410 --> 14:05.712
- AS PER USUAL.
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T--

14:05.812 --> 14:08.215
- MEL-- OH.
- WHY DID YOU COME, DOUG,

14:08.315 --> 14:11.418
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO LIGHT A FIRE?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.357
- Dave: WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- DO YOU THINK WE'RE
SELLING OUT

14:17.457 --> 14:19.326
- BY DOING A JINGLE?
- NO WAY, MAN.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.194
SOME OF THE BEST SONGS
ARE JINGLES.

14:21.294 --> 14:26.633
* PUSSYMART, PUSSYMART.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.768
- I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE.
- YOU GUYS ARE GONNA GET PAID

14:28.868 --> 14:31.638
- OUT OF THE ASS FOR THAT SHIT.
- THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.541
WE NEED TO NEGOTIATE
A DEAL AND WE'VE GOT
NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.776
WELL, GOOD LUCK
FOR YOU THEN,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.745
'CAUSE YOU'RE ONLY
IN DAVE'S HOUSE OF DEALS.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.713
THE D IN MY NAME
STANDS FOR "DEAL."

14:40.813 --> 14:42.715
AND DID YOU KNOW
THAT THE WORD "DAVE"

14:42.815 --> 14:45.318
ACTUALLY MEANS
"DEAL" IN LATINO?

14:45.418 --> 14:48.055
DOING A DEAL IS EASY,
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.190
HOW MUCH WOULD
YOU GIVE ME FOR THIS?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.125
- A DOLLAR.
- DOUBLE IT.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.560
- $2.
- DOUBLE IT AGAIN.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.095
- $4.
- SOLD!

14:55.195 --> 14:57.164
- WHAT'S GO-- WHAT?
- I JUST MADE HIM PAY

14:57.264 --> 14:59.399
NEARLY 10 TIMES
WHAT HE WANTED TO PAY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.669
- YOU JUST MANIPULATED HIM.
- IT'S CALLED THE DAVE-
DOUBLE-DOWN TECHNIQUE.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.172
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT THAT MACRAME OWL?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.240
- IT'S COOL.
IT WAS A GOOD ONE.
- YEAH.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.109
- OKAY, THANKS, MAN.
- THERE'S YOUR PEN.
JUST GIVE ME MY $4.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.445
- HMM?
- $4 PLEASE.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.016
- I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXERCISE.
- YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN
THE WHOLE LESSON.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.986
THAT'S FINE.
I'M GONNA WAIVE THE TAX.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.554
THANKS FOR THE TABLE.
AND GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, GUYS.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.726
THE SONG. WOW.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.429
- DO YOU LIKE IT?
- Martin and Caitlin:
LOVED IT.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.465
YOU ARE SPEAKING
FOR WOMEN, BY WOMEN.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.367
Martin:
THERE'S CERTAIN PARTS,
THOUGH,

15:34.467 --> 15:37.237
THAT I THINK COULD
USE A LITTLE WORK.
THIS SONG IS 18 MINUTES LONG.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.772
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A 30-SECOND COMMERCIAL HERE.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.874
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
MORE OF A CONCEPT.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.377
I KNOW YOU'RE
FROM NEW ZEALAND. WHAT IS
THIS, "LORD OF THE RINGS"?

15:44.477 --> 15:48.848
- WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.
- ALSO, THE LYRICS DON'T
REALLY FIT THE PRODUCT.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.718
THEY'RE NOT--
THEY'RE NOT COHESIVE AT ALL.

15:51.818 --> 15:54.187
SOME OF THEM AREN'T ABOUT--
SOME OF THEM AREN'T
ABOUT TOOTHPASTE,

15:54.287 --> 15:55.922
THEY'RE JUST THINGS
IN OUR LIFE.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.291
- YEAH.
- THEY DON'T--
THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE

15:58.391 --> 16:00.593
OKAY, SO JUST TALK
ABOUT TOOTHPASTE, REALLY?

16:00.693 --> 16:03.596
- Caitlin: YES.
- AND I HAVE SOME
BIG NEWS FOR YOU.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.165
I'VE CONVINCED
THE CLIENT

16:05.265 --> 16:07.900
TO PUT YOU GUYS
ON THE AD ON TV.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.370
- DO WE GET MORE MONEY?
- WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED
THE MONEY YET.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.307
- LET'S TALK MONEY.
- WE WERE WONDERING
IF YOU COULD DOUBLE IT.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.377
- I HAVEN'T
MENTIONED THE FEE YET.
- FORGET I SAID THAT.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.413
WHAT IS--
WHAT IS THE FEE?
I'M SORRY, BRET.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.549
THE FEE IS $1,000 EACH.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.085
- SORRY, NOW I'LL
SAY IT. DOUBLE IT.
- I AM DOUBLING IT.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.720
IT WAS GOING
TO BE $500 EACH.
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN $1,000.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.924
- HE ALREADY
DOUBLED IT IN HIS MIND.
- YEAH, I DOUBLED IT JUST NOW.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.560
- $1,000 EACH?
- YES.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.927
- DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
- Bret: OH, THAT'S GOOD.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.796
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.031
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.699
YOU'RE THE FEMIDENT BOYS.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.179
- MURRAY. MURRAY.
- OH!

16:53.313 --> 16:54.947
- MORNING, GUYS.
- HEY.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.649
ACTUALLY, GET IN THE CAR.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.451
I'VE GOT SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.055
- ARE YOU OKAY, MURRAY?
- YEAH, OF COURSE. WHY?

17:02.155 --> 17:04.924
- NO-- NO REASON.
- BRET, CAN YOU GET A PENCIL

17:05.024 --> 17:06.693
OUT OF MY STATIONERY
CABINET THERE, PLEASE?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.829
- WHERE'S THAT?
- THAT'S THE GLOVEBOX THERE.

17:09.929 --> 17:13.100
AH. OH.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.635
- HERE WE GO.
- THANK YOU.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.206
NOW, I'VE GOT
SOMETHING I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.308
I-- I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HOW TO SAY IT.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.876
SO I'M JUST GOING
TO SAY IT, OKAY?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.878
CAN I BE
YOUR MANAGER AGAIN?

17:25.978 --> 17:27.380
- NO.
- MMM, NO.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.916
RIGHT. SORRY,
SHOULD'VE DONE THE--

17:30.016 --> 17:32.752
- BRET?
- WE-- YOU'RE NOT
MANAGING US,

17:32.852 --> 17:34.287
- SO WE DON'T
DO ROLL CALLS.
- WE'LL JUST DO A--

17:34.387 --> 17:36.089
THIS IS NOT
A MEETING THOUGH.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.425
- PLEASE. COME ON, GUYS.
- NO.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.859
THINGS ARE GOING
WELL FOR US.
WE TOLD YOU.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.361
THINGS AREN'T
GOING WELL FOR ME.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.163
WHY DON'T YOU GET
YOUR OLD JOB BACK
AT THE CONSULATE?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.498
I CAN'T DO THAT, BRET.
I'VE MOVED ON.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.634
LOOK AT ME.
I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.002
PLUS WHEN I QUIT
I TOLD THEM ALL
TO GO STUFF THEMSELVES.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.071
REALLY?
TO THEIR FACES?

17:52.172 --> 17:53.640
NO, I WROTE IT DOWN,

17:53.740 --> 17:55.542
BUT IT'S THE SAME FEELING.
IMAGINE READING THAT.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.812
OKAY? I'VE PROBABLY
BEEN OSTRACIZED NOW.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.381
I'M PERSONA NON REGATES.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.049
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.452
- NO.
- YOU'RE NOT
AT YACHT RACE?

18:05.552 --> 18:08.188
YEAH. NO,
THEY DON'T TALK TO ME.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.956
ARE YOU LIVING
IN YOUR CAR, MURRAY?

18:10.056 --> 18:13.226
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S ILLEGAL.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.528
YOU CAN'T DO THAT...
APPARENTLY...

18:15.628 --> 18:17.997
UNLESS YOU
MOVE YOUR VEHICLE
EVERY THREE HOURS.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.433
( watch beeps )

18:20.533 --> 18:23.170
I'VE GOT TO GO.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
THANK YOU.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.338
OUT YOU GET.
GONE. BOTH OF YOU.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.774
THERE WASN'T A MEETING, MURRAY.
IT DOESN'T COUNT AS A MEETING.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.510
OKAY, GO ON.
NICE PANTS.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.546
- ARE THEY WOVEN? WOW.
- THESE ARE MAN-MADE.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.429
* YOU ARE A WOMAN,
YOU WEAR WOMEN'S WEAR *

18:49.529 --> 18:52.131
* YOU HAVE BREASTS
AND LONGISH HAIR, OH YEAH *

18:52.232 --> 18:54.467
* YOU'RE KIND OF FUN
EVERYWHERE *

18:54.567 --> 18:57.237
* YET YOU'RE STILL
VERY RARE, OH YEAH *

18:57.337 --> 19:00.540
* YOU'RE A WOMAN
AND YOU LOVE TO WEAVE *

19:30.570 --> 19:32.972
NOW IF YOU'LL JUST
FILL OUT THESE FORMS

19:33.072 --> 19:35.575
AND GET US COPIES

WE ARE DONE HERE TODAY.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.678
MMM, WE DON'T HAVE

19:38.778 --> 19:42.081
OH. BECAUSE YOU'RE FOREIGN,
YOU NEED WORK PERMITS

19:42.181 --> 19:44.584

19:44.684 --> 19:46.819
YES, GREEN CARDS. YOU DO
HAVE A GREEN CARD, RIGHT?

19:46.919 --> 19:50.189
- IS IT JUST
A BIT OF CARD?
- NO, IT'S--

19:50.290 --> 19:52.191
JUST A CARD,
A GREENISH CARD?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.827
- Caitlin: NO, IT'S--
- Jemaine: IS IT LIKE
A LIBRARY CARD?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.664
ARE YOU LEGALLY ALLOWED
TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY?

19:57.764 --> 20:00.333
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE LEGALLY ALLOWED
TO BE IN THE COUNTRY.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.702
NO, WE'RE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.572
I THINK YOU'D
BETTER BE IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR ATTORNEYS.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.441
YOU BASTARDS BETTER
BRING YOUR PASSPORTS IN

20:08.541 --> 20:10.977

20:26.693 --> 20:28.428
THEY'RE IN
THE CONSULATE OFFICE.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.464
I'M ACTUALLY JUST OUTSIDE
THERE NOW, BY CHANCE.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.533
It's just we're
in a little bit of trouble.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.502
- YOU'RE IN TROUBLE?
- LEGAL TROUBLE.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.904
YEAH, JEMAINE'S JUST SAYING
WE'RE IN LEGAL TROUBLE.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.507

PSST! GREG!

21:19.312 --> 21:21.914

21:23.450 --> 21:25.485
OH, GREG,

21:25.585 --> 21:28.655
ALL RIGHT?
STRAIGHT UP--
I'M VERY VERY--

21:28.755 --> 21:31.691
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PUT THIS, OKAY?

21:33.326 --> 21:35.428
THERE WERE A COUPLE
OF MESSAGES YOU HAD.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.263
NO, JUST GIVE US
A CHANCE, ALL RIGHT?

21:37.364 --> 21:39.265
THIS IS NOT EASY
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

21:39.366 --> 21:42.869
I WASN'T MYSELF.
THE THINGS I PUT IN
THAT LETTER-- UNBELIEVABLE.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.373

GYM MEMBERSHIP EXPIRING--

21:46.473 --> 21:50.242
ONE FROM THE PRIME MINISTER
FROM SEPTEMBER

21:50.343 --> 21:52.512
AND ONE JUST
BEFORE CHRISTMA--

21:52.612 --> 21:54.947
NO, THAT'S--
THAT WAS A WRONG NUMBER.

21:55.047 --> 21:58.651
- OKAY.
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

21:58.751 --> 22:01.788
UH, NO.
NO, THAT'S GOOD.
THANK YOU.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.461

22:18.371 --> 22:20.973

22:22.875 --> 22:26.379
( whispers )
GUYS. PSST!
COME HERE, COME HERE.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.415
COME HERE.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.250
( crew chatting )

22:31.350 --> 22:32.952
WELL, GOOD NEWS, GUYS:
I GOT MY JOB BACK,

22:33.052 --> 22:35.354
- I GOT YOUR PASSPORTS.
- THAT'S GREAT.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.189
BAD NEWS, GUYS:
YOUR PASSPORTS
AREN'T READY.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.291
- THEY'RE NOT PROCESSED.
- DO YOU HAVE THEM?

22:39.392 --> 22:41.661
- NO, THEY'RE IN MY CUPBOARD.
- YOU JUST SAID YOU HAD THEM.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.830
- I'VE GOT THEM IN MY CUPBOARD.
- HAVE YOU GOT OUR WORK VISAS?

22:43.930 --> 22:46.032
YOU DON'T HAVE
WORK VISAS. YOU'VE NEVER
NEEDED THEM BEFORE.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.900
YOU'VE NEVER HAD
A PROPER JOB.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.169
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
TRY TO MANAGE YOURSELVES.

22:50.269 --> 22:53.239
IF YOU HAD STUCK WITH ME,
YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THIS JOB
SITUATION, WOULD YOU?

22:53.339 --> 22:55.542
WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL
MARTIN UNDERSCORE CLARK?

22:55.642 --> 22:57.109
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU'RE MANAGING
YOURSELVES NOW.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.447
LOOK AT YOU--
NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.
RIGHT, NOW LISTEN TO ME.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.915
IF YOU HIRE ME BACK,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.817
- COME ON.
- OKAY.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.453
ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
YOU'RE OUR MANAGER AGAIN.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.754
- REALLY?
- YEAH, GREAT.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.656
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
- YOU MISS ME?

23:09.756 --> 23:11.558
- WELCOME BACK. NO.
- NO.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.426
- A LITTLE BIT.
A LITTLE BIT.
- A LITTLE BIT?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.061
OKAY, NOW HERE'S
MY ADVICE:

23:15.161 --> 23:17.096
I THINK WE SHOULD RUN
FOR IT. COME ON, LET'S GO.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.298
GO! RUN! RUN!

23:19.398 --> 23:21.100

23:35.815 --> 23:38.250
OH, BRET,

23:38.350 --> 23:41.187
OH, MAN.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.022
I MANAGED
TO GET YOU A SHOE, EH?

23:43.122 --> 23:44.624
THANKS, MURRAY.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.626
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:46.726 --> 23:48.461
I THINK THERE'S
A GUARDIAN ANGEL
LOOKING AFTER US.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.763
MURRAY, IT COULDN'T HAVE
POSSIBLY GONE WORSE.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.299
SOMEWHERE UP THERE,
SOMEONE'S LOOKING DOWN,

23:53.399 --> 23:55.535
MAKING SURE EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT OKAY FOR US.
