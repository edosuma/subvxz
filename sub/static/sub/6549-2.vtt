00:02.640 --> 00:05.600
The remains of seven or eight
children have been found

00:05.640 --> 00:09.080
freshly dismembered,
mutilated and rearranged.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.000
Find whoever is responsible.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.232
- When you do, inform me.
- I won't let you down, sir.

00:16.434 --> 00:18.434
The subjects ever move?

00:18.474 --> 00:21.234
No, Mr Marlott, they are dead.

00:21.845 --> 00:23.913
I supply the subjects around here.

00:23.953 --> 00:26.113
- What did you say?
- You heard.

00:26.153 --> 00:29.233
- What's in there?
- The Fortune of War.

00:29.273 --> 00:32.512
It's where they keep their bodies.
A porter wheeled one over

00:32.552 --> 00:34.738
to the Hospital around midnight,
on a meat trolley.

00:35.353 --> 00:38.833
- Alice disappeared ten days ago.
- The butcher's daughter.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.010
- I want to speak with her.
- You'll speak to me first.

00:42.197 --> 00:44.197
That dress, where did you get it?

00:44.237 --> 00:46.237
I'm looking for this girl, Alice.

00:46.277 --> 00:48.947
She had one just like it. Thought
you might have seen her.

00:48.979 --> 00:49.842
No.

00:49.877 --> 00:52.477
"LYCA," the little girl lost.

00:52.517 --> 00:54.517
Like Alice.

03:52.477 --> 03:54.437
This is a private gathering.

03:55.197 --> 03:57.157
I have business with William Blake.

03:57.197 --> 03:59.725
- Mr Blake is indisposed.
- Who is it, Mary?

03:59.818 --> 04:01.118
A stranger.

04:01.557 --> 04:03.186
Let him enter.

04:16.437 --> 04:18.103
My name is Marlott.

04:18.204 --> 04:20.204
John Marlott from Bow Street.

04:20.244 --> 04:21.583
Come...

04:22.284 --> 04:24.022
closer, John.

04:24.079 --> 04:25.551
You'll take tea?

04:26.754 --> 04:28.364
Yes, thank you.

04:35.404 --> 04:37.364
Who is Lyca?

04:38.324 --> 04:39.825
Aha.

04:41.564 --> 04:42.894
Oh...

04:44.238 --> 04:46.364
My lost child.

04:47.849 --> 04:49.524
When was she lost?

04:49.564 --> 04:52.244
As you see,
Mr Blake has been taken gravely ill.

04:52.284 --> 04:55.844
Now many, many years ago.

04:56.299 --> 04:58.674
When she first came to me.

04:59.204 --> 05:01.164
In a dream.

05:01.774 --> 05:03.204
Why?

05:03.488 --> 05:05.924
I'm looking for a girl named Alice.

05:06.504 --> 05:07.807
I thought...

05:08.693 --> 05:11.644
I know it's strange, but I thought
she might be one and the same.

05:11.684 --> 05:15.146
- Why would you think that?
- They are one!

05:17.053 --> 05:19.381
What, Alice and Lyca are the same?

05:20.244 --> 05:23.234
All the lost children.

05:24.475 --> 05:26.164
Tell me where to find her, then.

05:26.204 --> 05:28.204
She is not real.

05:29.404 --> 05:31.364
To find her

05:31.776 --> 05:33.776
you have to know

05:34.404 --> 05:37.564
the truth of the beast.

05:38.684 --> 05:40.154
What beast?

05:40.684 --> 05:42.348
The beast...

05:43.564 --> 05:45.524
with a face...

05:46.854 --> 05:48.364
of a man.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.404
Argh!

05:53.004 --> 05:56.044
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- I think perhaps you should leave.

05:57.150 --> 06:00.565
My apologies. I can see
I was mistaken in coming here.

06:00.571 --> 06:03.030
Please send a bill to me
at Bow Street Magistrates Court.

07:13.004 --> 07:14.964
How can that be?

07:16.564 --> 07:18.524
She's cured.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.804
All sins are forgiven here.

07:20.844 --> 07:22.804
No corruption.

07:42.804 --> 07:44.484
There's seven or eight regulars

07:44.524 --> 07:47.524
that come and go from the pub
at all hours, all except the chief.

07:47.564 --> 07:48.784
He stays put,

07:48.984 --> 07:51.604
drinking himself blind I daresay.

07:52.684 --> 07:54.644
So, how long do we sit on them?

07:54.684 --> 07:56.684
Till they give up their secrets.

07:57.924 --> 08:00.204
Did they take Alice
and the red-haired lad?

08:00.244 --> 08:03.124
Or was it the man who tried to blow
my head off last night?

08:03.164 --> 08:05.164
Or maybe they are in it together?

08:05.204 --> 08:07.604
They ain't a million miles
from each other.

08:08.484 --> 08:10.444
A chain of supply.

08:10.484 --> 08:13.604
One thing more,
one of them rented a cart

08:13.644 --> 08:16.564
but came back empty-handed.
From Stoke Newington.

08:16.604 --> 08:19.708
- How do you know?
- There was a set-to with the carter.

08:19.971 --> 08:21.888
- Cholera outbreak there.
- Cholera?

08:22.604 --> 08:25.044
That means they will be
scouting for trade.

08:25.084 --> 08:27.084
Means he will be going back.

08:28.884 --> 08:32.924
My days are consumed like smoke.
My heart is smitten.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.683
My days are like a shadow
that declineth

08:36.724 --> 08:38.724
while I am withered like grass.

08:39.524 --> 08:42.203
But thou, O Lord, shall endure.

08:43.015 --> 08:44.684
The heathen shall fear thy name

08:44.724 --> 08:47.997
and all the kings of the earth
they glory.

10:53.042 --> 10:54.284
What do you reckon?

10:54.808 --> 10:56.764
- 13 maybe.
- Never.

10:56.804 --> 10:59.124
Pike's crew got 20
for a small up at Guy's.

10:59.296 --> 11:01.616
That was last year.
Lucky to get ten now.

11:01.656 --> 11:02.723
Keep it down.

11:07.616 --> 11:09.576
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

11:23.736 --> 11:26.016
You ain't got
no business marching me...

11:26.056 --> 11:29.056
I'm an officer of the law.
I ain't done nothing wrong.

11:31.696 --> 11:32.797
Tell them.

11:36.136 --> 11:38.096
Nothing wrong?

11:39.936 --> 11:42.616
A dead body ain't property.

11:42.656 --> 11:44.656
And taking one ain't theft.

11:45.536 --> 11:46.796
Forgive me.

11:55.936 --> 11:57.477
This is theft.

11:57.936 --> 11:59.296
I didn't know that was there.

11:59.976 --> 12:01.348
But you did.

12:07.736 --> 12:10.016
That silver spoon
means transportation

12:10.385 --> 12:11.561
or maybe the drop.

12:12.096 --> 12:14.822
Or I could just let these good folks
string you up as you deserve.

12:15.336 --> 12:16.526
What do you want from me?

12:17.673 --> 12:19.856
What do you know about
the Anatomy Act?

12:20.176 --> 12:21.896
It's costing me my livelihood.

12:21.936 --> 12:24.256
Then what would you do
to stop it, murder?

12:24.830 --> 12:25.760
Murder?

12:25.994 --> 12:28.336
I'm a businessman. Here you are.

12:28.376 --> 12:30.376
Have a look for yourself.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.736
Incomings, outgoings,
it's all there.

12:32.776 --> 12:34.736
- Honest labour.
- Ha?

12:35.936 --> 12:38.075
You call stealing corpses
honest labour?

12:38.175 --> 12:40.936
It ain't a crime.
There's a demand, I supplies it.

12:40.976 --> 12:43.296
There's plenty out there trafficking
in worse,

12:43.336 --> 12:44.478
why don't you go after them?

12:45.976 --> 12:48.216
I had to use
a dead child as bait tonight.

12:48.256 --> 12:52.736
Any more from you and I swear on my
soul, you'll swing for it!

13:00.016 --> 13:01.976
Last winter I get a subject,

13:02.016 --> 13:04.336
fresh,
no more than a day underground,

13:04.376 --> 13:05.994
but when I gets it to the hospital,
they don't want it,

13:06.094 --> 13:08.368
they said they've already
got one fresher than mine.

13:09.106 --> 13:10.221
Is that unusual?

13:10.256 --> 13:12.576
What, so fresh
the rigor is still on it?

13:12.582 --> 13:14.646
A month later,
it happens to Billings' crew.

13:14.652 --> 13:16.772
And a month after that
to Will Murray.

13:18.056 --> 13:20.016
What are you trying to tell me?

13:21.376 --> 13:24.216
Someone has been murdering
to undercut our trade.

13:26.796 --> 13:28.716
And you don't know who it is?

13:29.216 --> 13:31.176
No-one knows.

13:33.336 --> 13:35.296
It's not good enough.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.462
Wait.

13:37.727 --> 13:39.376
What if I could find 'em for you?

13:46.076 --> 13:48.036
Get out!

13:54.932 --> 13:56.852
He says there is someone out there

13:56.892 --> 13:59.292
doing murder to supply bodies to the
surgeons.

13:59.332 --> 14:01.652
He'd say no different
if it were him though.

14:01.692 --> 14:03.968
- I don't think it's him.
- Why not?

14:04.121 --> 14:06.932
- Scum like that.
- Even maggots come in shapes and sizes.

14:07.397 --> 14:10.880
We're looking for a monster,
a beast with the face of a man.

14:12.016 --> 14:13.976
Beg pardon, sir?

14:14.016 --> 14:16.336
Make sure they are fast.
I need a minute.

14:18.336 --> 14:19.674
Right.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.575
Pleasant lodgings.

15:24.616 --> 15:26.383
Not lodgings, I'm the owner.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.656
Trade's been good to you, hasn't it?

15:28.696 --> 15:30.696
I've worked hard at it.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.559
Three days.

15:32.776 --> 15:35.379
That is the arrangement.
I'm keeping them for surety.

15:37.456 --> 15:39.416
Keep watch on him anyway.

15:39.456 --> 15:41.976
- All the while?
- Till I say otherwise.

15:51.456 --> 15:55.216
Board and lodgings for two, please,
Mr Forrester. Your best rates.

15:55.256 --> 15:57.256
I daresay Sir Robert can afford it.

15:57.296 --> 15:58.795
So...

15:59.336 --> 16:02.056
- will that be all you need from us?
- I'm afraid not.

16:02.677 --> 16:04.136
We'll be at your disposal, then.

16:04.176 --> 16:05.476
Obliged.

16:13.016 --> 16:14.976
You've come about the teapot.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.533
Sadly not.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.296
Mr Blake passed away last night.

16:20.154 --> 16:21.256
Ah...

16:21.296 --> 16:22.430
sorry to hear it.

16:23.336 --> 16:26.016
He said to be sure
you received this.

16:26.431 --> 16:28.055
His latest work.

16:28.096 --> 16:30.096
He did not live to see it published.

16:30.747 --> 16:32.136
Sure he meant it for me?

16:32.176 --> 16:34.026
I am unlikely to have misheard.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.915
Strange.

16:35.921 --> 16:38.441
It is as much a surprise to me
I can assure you.

16:41.016 --> 16:44.096
Should you find no use for it, I...

16:44.842 --> 16:46.536
would be glad to take it from you.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.904
Aye.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.662
May I take the liberty
of giving you my address?

16:53.016 --> 16:54.294
Thank you.

17:38.216 --> 17:40.176
How much?

17:41.256 --> 17:43.216
I'll come back.

17:48.762 --> 17:50.922
You look lovely.
Now sling your hook.

18:52.675 --> 18:56.513
You might have told me you were
expecting distinguished company.

19:08.483 --> 19:10.176
Please forgive my intrusion.

19:10.715 --> 19:13.395
I took the liberty of asking for you
at Bow Street

19:13.776 --> 19:16.096
- and they gave me your address.
- Not at all.

19:17.176 --> 19:18.649
How may I help?

19:19.970 --> 19:21.175
This...

19:21.216 --> 19:23.216
must sound presumptuous, but...

19:23.742 --> 19:26.111
it's I who wish to help you.

19:26.816 --> 19:29.856
- In what way?
- Firstly by apologising.

19:29.896 --> 19:33.376
When we met the other day, I spoke
slightingly of your conscience.

19:33.416 --> 19:36.416
- I can assure you, my lady...
- Please, Mr Marlott, I...

19:37.094 --> 19:38.456
I sense...

19:38.496 --> 19:40.030
you are an honest man

19:40.795 --> 19:43.136
who seeks to do God's work.

19:43.756 --> 19:45.735
That's why I've come, because...

19:46.264 --> 19:48.216
I believe you are in peril.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.563
- Peril?
- To your soul.

19:53.016 --> 19:56.056
You know what Sir Robert's
legislation entails?

19:56.096 --> 19:58.816
It aims to put the body-snatchers
out of business

19:58.856 --> 20:02.816
by assigning the unclaimed bodies
of the poor to the anatomy schools.

20:03.329 --> 20:06.129
A punishment
formerly reserved for murderers.

20:06.576 --> 20:09.936
Denying them their last hope of
redemption on Judgement Day.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.656
No holy burial, no body intact.

20:12.696 --> 20:13.944
No resurrection.

20:15.173 --> 20:18.136
See, if we deny Christ
to the poor, Mister Marlott,

20:19.216 --> 20:21.736
don't we also deny him to ourselves?

20:23.226 --> 20:24.975
And that's what is stake here.

20:25.338 --> 20:27.422
Not merely the future of medicine.

20:28.235 --> 20:31.555
But the prospect
of a world without God.

20:33.490 --> 20:37.410
The surgeons would argue that
the act is to the benefit of us all.

20:38.089 --> 20:40.490
Isn't that what they always say,
Mr Marlott?

20:41.416 --> 20:43.656
When it is the wealthy
who are to profit.

20:44.816 --> 20:46.493
This act

20:46.499 --> 20:49.099
seeks not only to supplant the
body-snatchers,

20:49.456 --> 20:51.776
it will also outlaw
all forms of medicine

20:51.816 --> 20:53.336
not licensed directly by the
surgeons,

20:53.493 --> 20:56.663
benign, philanthropic practices
such as Lord Hervey's.

20:57.176 --> 20:58.782
Your husband is a doctor?

21:00.616 --> 21:02.576
Lord Hervey is my brother.

21:03.155 --> 21:04.113
Ah.

21:04.656 --> 21:07.129
Yes, a physician.

21:07.816 --> 21:11.096
But as different from the surgeons
as night from day.

21:11.408 --> 21:13.256
A healer not a butcher.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.815
He runs a charitable hospital
east of London

21:15.856 --> 21:19.405
where the poor are treated with
the love and respect we all deserve.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.416
This is what your employer
has not told you.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.016
Ask Sir William Chester
if you doubt me.

21:26.056 --> 21:27.570
I don't doubt you, my lady.

21:27.862 --> 21:29.862
And I appreciate you coming here

21:29.868 --> 21:34.548
but please you must understand
that Sir Robert is my employer.

21:34.648 --> 21:35.696
As you say.

21:35.736 --> 21:39.783
And... you and I,
strangers to each other.

21:42.296 --> 21:44.656
Odd as it may seem, Mr Marlott...

21:46.816 --> 21:48.776
I don't feel you to be a stranger.

21:53.976 --> 21:56.576
I-I've taken up enough of your time.

21:57.656 --> 21:59.896
Please consider my words.
I realise...

22:00.310 --> 22:02.576
you may feel compromised by them.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.615
They are meant honourably.

22:07.216 --> 22:08.715
Good day to you.

22:40.616 --> 22:42.776
You are not a very good tail,
are you?

22:44.816 --> 22:46.341
I've got my orders.

22:46.414 --> 22:48.381
They won't help you much
if you want me useful.

22:48.849 --> 22:51.416
You go about your business,
I'll go about mine.

22:52.656 --> 22:54.274
Suit yourself.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.376
I'm fetching my boy from his nurse.

23:05.416 --> 23:06.780
You're welcome to walk with me.

23:18.216 --> 23:20.384
I thought you said
we were going to see your nurse?

23:21.016 --> 23:22.425
Her lodging is upstairs.

23:25.176 --> 23:27.096
- John.
- Bill.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.277
Porter?

23:31.016 --> 23:33.536
Thank you, and another one
for my friend, Mr...?

23:33.576 --> 23:34.580
Nightingale.

23:38.936 --> 23:40.896
- Nance in her room?
- Upstairs.

23:40.936 --> 23:42.936
We'll sink these on the way.

23:46.056 --> 23:48.936
This is the best pint
in Blaire Market.

23:48.976 --> 23:50.976
Argh!

24:00.976 --> 24:02.936
Where is he?

24:11.490 --> 24:12.939
Here is the book you asked for, sir.

24:15.686 --> 24:17.410
Huh, Collier's Bank, The Strand.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.210
That is where Pritty
keeps his savings.

24:22.539 --> 24:24.929
Take this to the manager there
impounding them.

24:24.970 --> 24:27.290
Then stay here
till I tell you otherwise.

24:27.330 --> 24:28.450
Sir.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.850
'Not merely the future of medicine

24:48.943 --> 24:52.290
but the prospect
of a world without God.'

25:24.650 --> 25:26.610
'Do subjects ever move?'

25:26.650 --> 25:28.650
'No, Mr Marlott, they are dead.'

26:42.250 --> 26:44.210
May I help you?

26:45.090 --> 26:46.449
I'm looking for Sir William.

26:47.090 --> 26:48.606
He's gone to Oxford on business.

26:49.130 --> 26:50.585
I'm in charge in his absence.

26:51.170 --> 26:52.939
- Who are you?
- John Marlott.

26:53.039 --> 26:56.210
- From Bow Street.
- And your business with Sir William?

26:56.250 --> 27:00.610
I need to speak to him about a
private matter we've been discussing

27:00.650 --> 27:02.610
with the Home Secretary.

27:02.650 --> 27:04.164
When does he return?

27:04.690 --> 27:06.236
I've no idea.

27:09.490 --> 27:12.690
Mr Pirkis, could you
come in here, please?

27:13.875 --> 27:15.835
Mr Pirkis?

27:21.450 --> 27:23.151
Do you know this gentleman?

27:23.450 --> 27:25.613
He says he has some business
with my cousin.

27:25.930 --> 27:28.570
Yes, sir, Mr Garnet,
we've met before.

27:29.836 --> 27:31.796
Nonetheless,

27:31.802 --> 27:34.122
I'm afraid that I must ask you to
leave now.

27:42.650 --> 27:45.010
Who sells you subjects
other than Pritty?

27:45.050 --> 27:47.130
Each hospital has got its main crew.

27:47.170 --> 27:49.610
- He's ours.
- Main or only?

27:49.650 --> 27:52.650
Once in a while, somebody
will show up with a bargain.

27:52.690 --> 27:54.076
What, someone you know?

27:54.081 --> 27:56.730
Sometimes, sometimes not.

27:56.770 --> 28:00.170
So anyone can turn up with a subject
and expect to get paid for it?

28:00.210 --> 28:02.690
- Yeah, in principle.
- Would you care where they sourced it?

28:02.695 --> 28:05.501
- What are you getting at?
- A competition for trade

28:05.506 --> 28:08.610
- resulting in murder.
- We're medical men.

28:08.650 --> 28:12.770
If we saw something suspect, we'd be
off down the beak and no error.

28:12.810 --> 28:13.908
Yeah, of course you would.

28:14.525 --> 28:17.491
When was the last time you bought
from someone other than Pritty?

28:18.290 --> 28:20.290
Funny you should ask.

28:23.850 --> 28:25.810
Mrs Bowyer.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.610
Good morning, gentlemen.

29:14.254 --> 29:17.273
Sir William has asked me
to conduct this morning's lecture

29:17.410 --> 29:19.410
on the peripheral nervous system.

29:20.397 --> 29:21.465
Today,

29:22.011 --> 29:24.087
we have a rare opportunity

29:24.092 --> 29:25.944
of a junior subject,

29:26.373 --> 29:27.662
freshly deceased.

29:32.130 --> 29:34.610
I will therefore
be taking this opportunity

29:34.650 --> 29:36.166
to conduct a display

29:36.171 --> 29:38.690
on the subject of bioelectricity,

29:38.730 --> 29:41.890
pioneering work of the Italian
physician Luigi Galvani

29:42.203 --> 29:45.723
with whom
you are all undoubtedly familiar.

29:46.810 --> 29:49.450
I will now make an incision

29:50.044 --> 29:52.291
in the subject's right arm.

29:52.296 --> 29:55.530
Allowing exposure
of the right ulnea nerve

29:55.570 --> 29:57.690
just between the lower triceps

29:57.730 --> 29:59.028
and the bicep.

30:08.633 --> 30:12.322
Galvani's thesis
was that electrical impulses

30:12.328 --> 30:16.208
are carried along the nerves
by an independent system of fluids,

30:16.214 --> 30:18.454
invisible to the human eye.

30:18.730 --> 30:21.450
That this process
can be seen to function

30:21.490 --> 30:25.050
in conjunction with
artificially induced energy

30:25.090 --> 30:28.370
in the absence of other animate
processes

30:28.410 --> 30:32.050
seems to suggest that it lies
at the very foundation

30:32.090 --> 30:36.530
of what we now understand to be
multi-cellular organic life.

30:37.610 --> 30:40.850
We now have the opportunity
to observe it functioning...

30:41.207 --> 30:42.890
at close quarters.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.697
What the devil is going on?

31:32.703 --> 31:36.423
For God's sake, somebody get these
creatures out of here right now.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.610
Is this some sort of joke?

31:41.650 --> 31:43.341
Get out!

31:43.690 --> 31:45.690
It's not a bloody farm yard!

31:45.730 --> 31:47.730
Go on, get out! Get out!

31:50.643 --> 31:52.040
Who put you up to it?

31:52.273 --> 31:55.050
- A gentleman, sir.
- Age?

31:55.090 --> 31:56.689
About yours, sir.

31:56.694 --> 31:58.200
Describe him.

31:58.205 --> 32:01.170
Curls he had. Fairish hair.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.721
Tall.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.782
Have you seen him before?

32:07.330 --> 32:09.610
He came to the sheep market
this morning.

32:10.004 --> 32:12.890
Bought the beasts and gave us
a shilling to do his bidding.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.930
Could there be greater calumny?

32:18.554 --> 32:19.969
In times of old,

32:20.010 --> 32:23.410
criminals cut from the gallows were
thought sufficient

32:23.450 --> 32:25.690
to furnish our anatomists' tables.

32:25.730 --> 32:28.150
But now it is to be any one of us,

32:28.227 --> 32:32.307
unlucky enough to find themselves
unclaimed at death's door,

32:32.347 --> 32:34.933
in prison or the workhouse.

32:35.187 --> 32:39.667
That means you, poor schoolteacher,
fallen ill or on hard times.

32:39.707 --> 32:43.547
You, poor grandmother,
unable to pay your rent.

32:43.587 --> 32:46.627
You, poor weaver or farmer,

32:46.667 --> 32:51.667
out of penny because of rising taxes
or falling duties.

32:51.707 --> 32:55.827
You and you and you.

32:55.867 --> 32:58.307
What further proof do you require

32:58.347 --> 33:02.027
that this government seeks to make
poverty a crime?

33:02.067 --> 33:04.667
And the afterlife
a privilege of the wealthy?

33:06.747 --> 33:08.747
Let me have a thousand names.

33:08.787 --> 33:13.507
I will take this petition
to the Home Secretary in person.

33:13.547 --> 33:15.867
Let him then tell us that he has

33:15.907 --> 33:19.667
the interests of the Christian
people of England at heart.

33:20.747 --> 33:23.107
Now, who will sign first?

33:23.147 --> 33:25.147
You, sir.

33:25.187 --> 33:27.187
Come.

33:28.987 --> 33:30.947
- Outside, outside.
- Come.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.827
May I read?

33:59.707 --> 34:01.667
If you can.

34:06.907 --> 34:08.867
Shorthand.

34:08.907 --> 34:10.907
I'm a reporter.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.827
For the Chronicle.
Short stories and novels, too.

34:13.867 --> 34:15.867
Name is Boz.

34:19.867 --> 34:22.627
- Didn't get yours though.
- I didn't give it.

34:23.706 --> 34:26.667
We seem always to be running into
each other, don't we?

34:26.706 --> 34:28.120
Are you with the Herald?

34:28.746 --> 34:31.027
I think you know very well who I am.

34:32.179 --> 34:33.065
I do.

34:33.107 --> 34:34.647
Try me.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.827
You're a government agent.

34:40.907 --> 34:42.867
Close enough.

34:42.907 --> 34:44.907
I write with that hand.

34:44.947 --> 34:46.947
No, you don't.

34:46.987 --> 34:48.268
I've been watching you.

34:49.023 --> 34:51.110
What were you doing at St
Bartholomew's yesterday?

34:51.147 --> 34:53.147
I wanted to write about the lecture.

34:53.523 --> 34:54.675
Why that one?

34:55.226 --> 34:56.534
It was interesting.

34:57.267 --> 34:59.096
Yeah, that is one way
of describing it.

35:00.867 --> 35:02.633
How did you know to be there?

35:02.638 --> 35:04.867
The same way that you did.

35:06.234 --> 35:08.206
I received a letter.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.727
At the newspaper offices.

35:10.843 --> 35:12.500
From whom?

35:12.597 --> 35:14.061
Anonymous.

35:14.730 --> 35:17.871
- Saying?
- That there was to be a disruption

35:17.876 --> 35:19.947
that would make
an interesting news story.

35:21.867 --> 35:25.467
Should you receive
any more letters like that one,

35:25.507 --> 35:27.867
I would ask you
to bring them to me...

35:27.907 --> 35:31.267
before the events
they predict come to pass.

35:32.467 --> 35:34.427
And where may I find you?

35:34.467 --> 35:37.227
Bow Street Magistrates. John Marlott.

35:37.267 --> 35:39.634
- You're a runner?
- Not exactly.

35:40.907 --> 35:42.434
Speaking plainly,

35:43.061 --> 35:44.907
what's in it for me? Hmm?

35:44.947 --> 35:48.321
Sources are sources
and a story is a story.

35:48.327 --> 35:51.584
If you do, I may be able
to give you a better story.

35:51.787 --> 35:53.056
And if I don't?

35:54.299 --> 35:55.955
I may break your thumb.

35:58.067 --> 35:59.542
Boz, you say?

36:00.067 --> 36:01.717
Remember the name.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.627
All sins are forgiven here.

36:24.073 --> 36:25.399
No corruption.

36:30.347 --> 36:32.307
I want to be with you again.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.346
Patience.

36:34.387 --> 36:35.931
You will be.

36:51.545 --> 36:52.712
God botherers?

36:53.045 --> 36:54.316
That is your thesis?

36:54.617 --> 36:57.136
That thing we saw came from hell,
man, not the church.

36:57.141 --> 36:59.461
And I'll follow it there,
if need be, sir,

37:00.303 --> 37:01.849
but Lady Hervey...

37:01.854 --> 37:04.982
- What of her?
- She sought me out at my lodgings.

37:04.987 --> 37:06.987
A lady of quality? Why?

37:07.027 --> 37:09.513
To denounce your policy. She says.

37:09.518 --> 37:12.118
- You are not seriously suggesting...
- No, sir.

37:12.158 --> 37:14.158
But her escort at church...

37:14.559 --> 37:16.718
the man who spoke against
you at Westminster.

37:16.758 --> 37:19.878
Sir Bentley Warburton?
A fellow parliamentarian?

37:19.918 --> 37:23.199
And your opponent.
Might he not have motive therefore?

37:23.204 --> 37:26.357
- To make that thing?
- If he's capable of paying men

37:26.362 --> 37:29.798
to disrupt anatomy classes,
as I suspect,

37:29.838 --> 37:32.032
what else would he be
willing to sponsor?

37:32.037 --> 37:34.910
He could have told her about me
and asked her to call.

37:34.915 --> 37:36.026
 As a spy?

37:37.438 --> 37:38.931
What else did you talk about?

37:38.936 --> 37:41.692
Mainly God, sir. And her brother,

37:41.849 --> 37:43.047
Lord Hervey.

37:43.052 --> 37:43.989
What about him?

37:43.994 --> 37:46.606
How his work is under
threat by the Anatomy Act.

37:46.611 --> 37:48.880
Does that not raise your
suspicions even more?

37:48.885 --> 37:49.860
Yes, sir, it does.

37:49.865 --> 37:52.965
I've been looking into him
and I intend to do so further.

37:53.825 --> 37:56.718
He runs a hospital of some kind
in the East End.

37:57.027 --> 37:58.759
A quackery, I hear.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.798
First a knight,

38:00.838 --> 38:02.509
and now a peer of the realm?

38:02.878 --> 38:06.598
An eccentric one though, Sir Robert.
Might he not fit the bill?

38:06.638 --> 38:08.743
These are dangerous paths you are
treading, Mr Marlott.

38:08.748 --> 38:10.818
You asked me to investigate, sir.

38:11.278 --> 38:14.638
- And the body-snatchers?
- I have them under surveillance,

38:14.678 --> 38:16.478
but I have to consider they are working

38:16.511 --> 38:18.991
as instruments for someone else, a
chain of supply.

38:19.038 --> 38:21.375
Your conspiracies are
multiplying, Mr Marlott.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.484
There's one more, sir.

38:22.489 --> 38:23.797
Will I like it any better?

38:23.802 --> 38:28.118
By my calculation, that thing we
found floated downstream

38:28.158 --> 38:31.412
with the tides from Greenwich.
A good three hours in the water.

38:31.486 --> 38:32.531
And?

38:33.223 --> 38:35.375
Well, if it was supposed to be found

38:35.381 --> 38:37.225
and interpreted as the
work of the surgeons,

38:37.230 --> 38:39.168
that is leaving much to chance.

38:39.173 --> 38:41.406
Might not someone with sedition in
mind

38:41.411 --> 38:44.472
take care their outrage
be discovered?

38:44.477 --> 38:47.104
Rather than simply letting it drift
God knows where.

38:47.109 --> 38:50.407
If that obscenity was not fashioned
for our benefit,

38:50.412 --> 38:51.991
then what is the reason for it?

38:52.590 --> 38:55.638
None... that I can fathom, sir.

38:55.678 --> 38:58.158
How do you find a man
without plan or motive?

38:58.198 --> 38:59.726
But not without method.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.591
At least in this case,
the rudiments of surgery.

39:02.998 --> 39:04.998
- Hardly conclusive.
- No, sir.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.278
But it is a possibility.

39:06.284 --> 39:08.478
Well, let's hope you
can exclude it, then.

39:08.557 --> 39:09.721
For all our sakes.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.711
Sweet Thames runs softly.

39:14.792 --> 39:16.792
But not always of its own accord,
eh?

39:17.174 --> 39:18.370
Sir?

39:18.872 --> 39:20.872
This city, Mr Marlott,

39:21.461 --> 39:25.831
dragged kicking and screaming
like a raucous infant

39:25.872 --> 39:27.872
towards a better future.

39:28.752 --> 39:30.712
One way or another.

39:32.352 --> 39:36.192
Do well by me, and...
you'll be assured a part in it.

39:37.232 --> 39:41.072
Fail, and I promise I will deny all
knowledge of you.

39:41.112 --> 39:43.112
And your wild accusations.

39:52.292 --> 39:54.252
Frankenstein, sir.

39:54.258 --> 39:57.538
I'm sorry it took so long.
I had to go to three booksellers.

39:57.992 --> 39:59.992
May I ask why, sir?

40:01.872 --> 40:04.032
Am I to be remaindered, then, sir?

40:04.072 --> 40:06.192
What makes you think
I'd be that kind?

40:06.816 --> 40:09.912
Pritty gave you something to remember
him by. Now I'll do the same.

40:09.952 --> 40:13.072
Bentley Warburton.
Honourable member for Walthamstow.

40:13.112 --> 40:16.387
Resides at the Albany, Piccadilly.
I want to know his habits.

40:16.392 --> 40:19.861
Where he goes. Who he knows.
Who pays him house calls.

40:30.072 --> 40:32.032
- Hey.
- I ain't running.

40:32.072 --> 40:33.371
What are you doing here?

40:38.072 --> 40:40.032
I know who took her.

40:43.072 --> 40:45.032
Thanks.

40:57.072 --> 40:59.032
Tell me about Alice.

41:00.112 --> 41:02.072
Billy's got a regular crew.

41:02.112 --> 41:04.112
He feeds us.

41:04.152 --> 41:05.643
He keeps us safe.

41:06.192 --> 41:08.192
In return, we bring him stuff.

41:09.272 --> 41:11.232
Sometimes other kids.

41:11.272 --> 41:13.272
So you brought him Alice?

41:16.552 --> 41:18.512
I saw her...

41:19.552 --> 41:21.512
in the market.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.024
I liked her dress.

41:26.872 --> 41:29.032
I said I'd give her
something for it.

41:30.032 --> 41:31.992
But she didn't want to give it up.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.032
Billy forced her.

41:34.712 --> 41:36.672
Next day he took her away.

41:38.072 --> 41:40.032
I tried to save her, I swear.

41:41.872 --> 41:43.832
But he says it was either me or her.

41:45.472 --> 41:47.432
You or her for what?

41:48.312 --> 41:50.272
I don't know. Honest.

41:55.272 --> 41:57.232
So, where is she now?

41:57.952 --> 41:59.912
With the others.

41:59.952 --> 42:01.952
Where?

42:02.992 --> 42:04.952
They just...

42:04.992 --> 42:06.992
go.

42:22.472 --> 42:25.312
Tomorrow we'll find you
somewhere better to stay.

42:26.592 --> 42:28.552
I'd feel safer with you.

42:28.592 --> 42:30.592
My landlady might disagree.

42:32.672 --> 42:34.632
At Billy's...

42:34.672 --> 42:36.992
did you ever see
a little red-haired lad?

42:41.472 --> 42:43.432
I don't think so.

42:51.792 --> 42:53.752
You know that picture.

42:55.832 --> 42:57.992
You can sleep
in the bedroom tonight.

42:58.032 --> 43:00.032
I'll stay in here.

44:13.592 --> 44:15.952
St Petersburg, December 11.

44:17.072 --> 44:20.312
You will rejoice to hear that no
disaster has accompanied

44:20.352 --> 44:22.352
the commencement of an enterprise,

44:22.392 --> 44:24.712
which you have regarded with such
evil...

44:24.752 --> 44:28.112
Life and death appear to me
ideal bounds,

44:29.192 --> 44:31.152
which I should first break through,

44:31.192 --> 44:33.792
and pour a torrent of light
into our dark world.

44:33.832 --> 44:38.912
A new species would bless me as its
creator and source.

44:38.952 --> 44:41.672
Who shall conceive the horrors of my
secret toil

44:41.712 --> 44:45.832
as I dabbled among the unhallowed
damps of the grave

44:45.872 --> 44:50.272
or tortured the living animal
to animate the lifeless clay?

44:57.072 --> 44:59.032
Flora?

45:02.872 --> 45:10.712
♪ Oranges and lemons
say the bells of St Clement's ♪

45:10.752 --> 45:15.312
- Alice.
- ♪ You owe me five farthings ♪

45:15.352 --> 45:19.312
♪ Say the bells of St Martin's ♪

45:19.352 --> 45:24.272
- Who took you?
- ♪ When will you pay me? ♪

45:24.312 --> 45:27.632
♪ Say the bells of Old Bailey ♪

45:27.672 --> 45:30.192
Alice. Alice, answer me.

45:30.232 --> 45:37.072
♪ When I grow rich,
say the bells of Shoreditch ♪

45:49.672 --> 45:51.632
Oh, Alice.

45:53.072 --> 45:54.633
Flora, sir.

46:02.751 --> 46:04.711
You must have been dreaming.

46:06.072 --> 46:07.446
No.

46:08.524 --> 46:09.617
Not dreaming.

46:12.202 --> 46:13.432
Seeing things.

46:15.711 --> 46:16.855
What things, sir?

46:18.672 --> 46:19.946
Alice.

46:21.991 --> 46:24.151
I think I know
what has become of her.

46:38.272 --> 46:41.672
An Investigation Into The Galvanic
Response Of Dead Tissue.

46:41.712 --> 46:44.792
By William Chester D Phil
Christchurch. Name, please.

46:44.832 --> 46:46.832
