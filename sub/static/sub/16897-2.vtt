01:09.861 --> 01:13.957
Suit fresh from the cleaners: Check.

01:14.116 --> 01:18.417
<i>Irish singing voice: Check.</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:22.920
<i>An uncomplicated client
that I've known for a while:</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:25.002
<i>Check.</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:27.170
<i>It was gonna be an easy night.</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:29.465
Whoa, could you hold that, please?

01:31.425 --> 01:34.599
- Thanks.
- What floor?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.308
Same.

01:50.819 --> 01:56.576
- Sounds pretty rocking tonight.
- Oh, yeah. It's rocking.

02:24.561 --> 02:28.407
<i>It wasn't exactly my scene, but I had
a job to do and I knew how to do it.</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:31.485
<i>I just had to find my client.</i>

02:32.027 --> 02:34.200
<i>And there she was.</i>

02:54.132 --> 02:58.012
All right, so she's there waiting for you, and
some little punk came along and stole her?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.851
He didn't steal her. He knew her.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.233
He brought her a cupcake.

03:03.392 --> 03:07.272
All right, Ray, I don't know. Maybe you
should've just gone up there and cut in.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.275
Cut in? It's not the senior prom, Tanya.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.159
Ray, women like to be fought over.

03:13.318 --> 03:17.198
I mean sometimes they'll have sex with
the guy that seems to want them the most.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.413
- It's a biological imperative.
- Thank you, Darwin.

03:20.575 --> 03:24.796
You don't listen to me.
You have to listen to me.

03:24.955 --> 03:29.927
- Since when?
- Ray, ahem, every ship has a captain.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.678
And I'm the pimp.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.841
And this ship has been successful
because of the way I run it.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.390
- You think you're running the ship?
- I do. it's just a fact.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.733
Have you considered you might have
a problem with female authority?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.019
Cut the crap.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.359
I have a problem with you saying
that you're the captain, okay?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.695
When we're partners.

03:52.858 --> 03:57.409
Well, we're partners,
but, Ray, I mean, I call the shots.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.294
All right, we're partners.
We're partners, all right? Ahem.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.296
It was just a misunderstanding.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.878
I will call Christina
into my office and find out.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.792
In the meantime, get some sleep...

04:10.959 --> 04:13.428
because you have
a 4 a.m. with Lydia.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.978
<i>Yeah, partners.
One of us got some sleep.</i>

04:21.136 --> 04:25.107
<i>The other got up at 4 a.m.
to have sex with Rambo.</i>

04:25.515 --> 04:29.145
<i>I didn't mind the running
or the costume...</i>

04:30.896 --> 04:33.820
<i>but the tackling wasn't my favorite.</i>

04:34.107 --> 04:36.781
No, no cuffs. No. No cuffs.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.787
<i>Suddenly every woman
in my life wanted to be on top.</i>

04:39.946 --> 04:42.415
- You packing?
- What?

04:44.493 --> 04:48.373
Oh, you are packing.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.221
<i>Then we got up and did it again.</i>

04:58.840 --> 05:00.717
<i>She got me in the knee that time.</i>

05:00.884 --> 05:05.014
<i>And those fucking handcuffs,
like a pair of nunchucks.</i>

05:18.610 --> 05:20.203
Ron.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.075
Sorry, Jess. Gotta get my 45 minutes.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.871
- Can I just get my check and I'll go?
- I've gotta keep my heart rate elevated.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.677
I thought we were going to be adults.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.717
Adults support themselves.

05:42.634 --> 05:46.264
Ron, I know this is something you
couldn't possibly understand...

05:46.429 --> 05:50.730
but I have been out of
the job market for almost 20 years.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.112
You wanna have your cake and eat it?
I won't be your baker.

05:54.271 --> 05:58.196
What? What are you...?
What are you talking about?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.326
- What cake?
- He's the cake.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.534
- Ray is the cake.
- What?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.496
Ron, I think these are too big.

06:06.658 --> 06:10.504
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna wait over here.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.131
You know what? Ray is not the cake.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.171
We are not together.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.056
And last I checked, you were
the one getting jerked off...

06:22.215 --> 06:24.138
in the back of a car, not me.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.475
- I didn't come.
- Fuck you.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.514
Fuck your fucking check.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.980
Jess, come back.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.989
Look, she's my sparring partner.
She likes to box, I like to box.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.946
I love you.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.910
I have your check.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.615
I'm sorry this is so awkward.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.201
It's not awkward, Mindy.
Not awkward at all.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.664
Giving a handjob when your
husband is 10 feet away...

06:49.826 --> 06:51.874
buying a candy bar, now that...

06:52.037 --> 06:55.792
is not the classiest move
in the world, Mindy.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.334
But we're good.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.262
We are so fucking good!

07:11.097 --> 07:14.567
Look. No, no, it gives you diarrhea.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.605
Yummy. Look, chicken.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.741
And some potatoes. Hi.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.821
Hello.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.948
- Hi, Jason.
- Ho!

07:28.114 --> 07:30.242
- Hey.
- Look, 200 bucks.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.785
It's for your next one.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.875
You've got another woman
that wants to bang?

07:34.037 --> 07:35.960
- Wants to fuck me'?
- Yes, I did.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.466
And birthday girl wants
to book you again too.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.595
- I was right, she likes you better.
- Huh. Okay.

07:41.753 --> 07:46.759
- What's the matter? Didn't you like it?
- No, I dug it. I mean, what's not to like?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.723
I'm getting paid to bang.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.310
It's just, why do I have to steal them
from that other dude?

07:52.472 --> 07:55.225
You're not stealing, Jason.
It's reparations.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.520
That other dude and his manager
stole from me.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.195
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

07:59.354 --> 08:03.575
- Great. I'll set something up for Wednesday?
- Oh, man, I gotta work Wednesday.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.579
- Get someone to fill in for you.
- Um...

08:08.071 --> 08:11.666
Maybe Bob.
Oh, fuck, Bob's mad at me.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.920
- Okay, so how's your Saturday?
- Saturdays are no good.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.921
What are you talking about?
Every Saturday?

08:17.080 --> 08:22.837
Yeah, kind of. And every other
Wednesday is our alone time.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.796
Who, you and your dick?

08:24.963 --> 08:27.261
- No, me and Sandee.
- Who the fuck is Sandee?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.142
My fiancée.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.933
Oh, I'm kind of engaged.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.018
He told you that I sent him?

08:38.183 --> 08:41.154
Yeah, because you thought
I'd like him better than Richard.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.153
Sorry.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.694
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. It went in the wrong hatch.

08:47.861 --> 08:54.335
No, I'm just... I'm just so happy that you...
That you like my new guy, Christina.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.586
- Jason was amazing.
- Jason.

08:56.745 --> 09:01.091
We literally fucked all night.
I'm, like, exhausted today.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.219
Well, yeah, that would be Jason.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.175
Anyway, I got your e-mail this morning.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.676
My e-mail? That I...

09:10.842 --> 09:13.265
Right, that I sent you this morning.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.978
Yeah, I'm too fucked up for tonight,
but I can totally do tomorrow.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.363
Great.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.065
Ray. Ray. Fuck.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.736
You gotta wake up. Wake up.
She's hacked into my e-mail, Ray.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.656
She's having cyber conversations
with our clients.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.699
- We're under siege.
- Slow down.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.460
Read this, you'll see. It's my e-mail.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.212
- Read that.
- "OMS he was...

09:39.370 --> 09:43.170
"OMG he was totes ahmaz
srsly magic tongue. Thx!"

09:43.333 --> 09:45.381
T-H-X.
It's like hieroglyphics.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.467
And then she writes back, "luv ya."

09:48.630 --> 09:50.223
I don't write "ya."

09:50.381 --> 09:52.509
it's "I love you.“ "I love you," Ray.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.269
That's Lenore.
She fucking stole our clients!

09:55.428 --> 09:57.851
Well, I told you, Tanya.
I knew something was up.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.982
Who doesn't listen?

10:00.141 --> 10:02.644
- I have a plan. I have a plan.
- Huh?

10:02.811 --> 10:04.984
It's the broken-window theory.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.649
If you have a house
and there's a broken window...

10:07.816 --> 10:10.615
and you don't fix it right away,
you get more broken windows.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.576
- You also get graffiti all over your house.
- That's your plan?

10:13.738 --> 10:16.833
My plan is I'm gonna go
ambush this guy tomorrow night.

10:16.991 --> 10:21.041
- You? Yourself?
- Correct.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.925
Tanya, let me handle it, okay?
I should talk to him, man to man.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.212
No, that's... What? That's my job.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.631
That's my job.

10:30.797 --> 10:35.052
Tanya, no offense, but you tend
to get a little emotional...

10:35.218 --> 10:36.891
during these situations, you know?

10:37.053 --> 10:40.057
- A little hysterical. Uhn.
- Ray! Hysterical?

10:40.223 --> 10:42.396
Words like that have kept
women down for centuries.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.027
- Ow. Tanya.
- What? What's wrong with you?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.318
I spent half the night playing
cops and robbers, okay?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.572
Just let me handle it.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.859
- You're backup.
- Backup?

10:51.025 --> 10:53.869
- You just stand by, okay?
- Backup?

10:54.362 --> 10:57.241
- Jess, hey. What's up?
- I'm backup.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.262
Hi, can I help you?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.229
Yes, I would like to buy a cake.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.523
What'd you have in mind?
We've got chocolate.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.686
- We've got vanilla.
- I'll take that one.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.447
Great. Is it for a special occasion? Would
you like to add a personalized message?

11:29.606 --> 11:31.529
- Sure.
- Super.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.490
And what would you like
your cake to say?

11:34.652 --> 11:40.876
"I fucked your boyfriend."

11:41.701 --> 11:44.750
- That's what you want the cake to say?
- Yes.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.339
I think that the company
might have some sort of policy...

11:50.501 --> 11:55.007
- ...against using swear words.
- Oh. Oh, "screwed" is fine.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.509
Yeah? Yeah.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.435
And is this for pickup or delivery?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.692
Delivery. What's your address?

12:06.601 --> 12:09.229
- I li... Excuse me?
- Where do you live?

12:09.395 --> 12:13.946
I live at 323 North Deerfield Road,
apartment 5.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.954
Great, put 323 North Deerfield Road,
apartment 5.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.741
That's where I live.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.208
Yes. The cake's for you.

12:25.954 --> 12:29.549
Okay, um... You're getting me a cake?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.509
I fucked your boyfriend.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.883
Yes.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.392
- I have a fiancé.
- I fucked your fiancé.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.602
Sandee. Sandee.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.235
You call him now, you'll end up
fucking him by the end of the night.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.773
Then the next time he feels like it,
he'll cheat on you again.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.909
But if you don't return his calls,
go away for a week...

12:56.067 --> 12:58.570
there's no telling
what you could get out of him.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.159
Men are dogs, Sandee.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.616
Be top bitch.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.293
It's not heart attack. It's chicken wings.

13:13.459 --> 13:17.635
- What kind of pain is it, Lottie?
- It's chicken-wing type of pain.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.265
Is Grandma having a heart attack?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.222
- No.
- Well, why are we in the hospital?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.261
Because she eats the bones.

13:32.103 --> 13:35.403
- Hey, are you gonna manage with the...?
- It's okay.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.363
We're still on Ronnie's insurance, Ray.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.244
I just have to pay the deductible is all.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.246
You need a little cash?

13:42.405 --> 13:44.578
We'll be fine. I'm getting a job.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.618
I'm just waiting
for them to call me back.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.537
How about a loan? Pay me back.

13:49.704 --> 13:52.708
Come on, Jess.
Let me give you some cash.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.672
Hey.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.930
- Hi.
- Matt.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.307
Matt Kopylov. Mindy's husband.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.185
Ex-husband almost.
Separated. Estranged.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.221
- Hi.
- We played Scrabble that time.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.482
You had some great words,
and you got those twins.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.643
Hey, guys.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.312
- Is my mother gonna be okay?
- Oh, yes, she's fine.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.823
- Probably indigestion.
- Oh, that's great.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.324
Thank you. I was worried.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.451
Happy to help.
And if you need anything...

14:20.610 --> 14:24.035
heart-related,
Scrabble-related or otherwise...

14:24.614 --> 14:25.786
just, uh...

14:27.533 --> 14:28.750
Okay.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.345
Damn, look at you.
Like a diamond in the rough.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.017
- What, I look different?
- You got one of them makeovers?

14:48.179 --> 14:50.227
Oh, no. Business has been good.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.894
- We hit a sweet spot.
- So you gonna get me out of here?

14:54.060 --> 14:58.941
Charlie, the last time I saw you,
you told me to stop wasting your time.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.401
You were hurt by that.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.407
You felt what? insulted?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.289
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.328
But we shared a few
good moments, right?

15:12.120 --> 15:15.920
I mean, we had a commonality.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.131
I gave you another perspective
on your field of work.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.421
Do you think I need you?

15:22.755 --> 15:26.134
Look, Tanya. I need bail.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.845
- What's it gonna be?
- I don't know, Charlie.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.139
I'm gonna think about it.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.807
I'll get back to you.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.568
I've got business to take care of.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.510
Bushmills straight.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.263
Jason?

16:17.268 --> 16:18.520
Jason?

16:19.437 --> 16:20.529
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.534
- Christina won't be here today.
- Oh, okay.

16:25.401 --> 16:29.247
I'm Tanya.
Does that name mean anything to you?

16:29.405 --> 16:33.831
- I have a cousin named Tanya.
- Yeah. ls your cousin a pimp?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.871
- I don't think so.
- Mm.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.382
Jason, look at me.
Do I look like some kind of...

16:39.540 --> 16:42.635
sucker to you?
Like some kind of a patsy?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.137
Some kind of chump or fool?

16:45.296 --> 16:46.548
- No. No.
- No?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.591
Why do you treat me like one, then?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.227
- Lenore sent you, right?
- Who's Lenore?

16:51.385 --> 16:56.266
Jason, Christina told me
that you told her Tanya sent you.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.857
Now, I'm Tanya, and I know
I didn't send you, so...

17:00.019 --> 17:03.148
- My cousin Tanya isn't as pretty as you.
- Oh, my God. All right.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.941
That ﬂattery is not gonna work.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.609
I'm here because I know
that you have been specifically...

17:07.777 --> 17:09.996
with Lenore targeting my clients.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.202
Clients that I worked
very hard to cultivate.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.368
- I'm telling you...
- I love that tattoo.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.755
A woman's wrist is just so sexy.

17:18.913 --> 17:23.292
I need you to stop, okay?
I need you to slop stealing my clients.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.383
I've been very good to these women,
and Lenore, she's a snake.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.140
You don't... Don't trust her.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.393
I'm sorry.
How can I make it up to you?

17:41.978 --> 17:44.697
<i>Partners. One of us was there at 7.</i>

17:44.855 --> 17:46.903
<i>The other weaseled in at 6.</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:04.250
Oh, yeah.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.920
Yeah, fuck.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.054
Yeah, fuck! Ah!

18:09.422 --> 18:12.141
God, yeah! Fuck me!

18:12.300 --> 18:15.349
Yeah! Fuck!

18:15.511 --> 18:18.390
Sweet. Sweet balls.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.150
Sweet balls.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.079
Ray, hi.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.166
- I got here early.
- I can see that, Tanya.

18:41.329 --> 18:46.381
- Where's the guy?
- Um... You know what? It's all set.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.965
I took care of it.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.760
- Oh, yeah?
- What?

18:51.922 --> 18:54.892
Did you just have sex with that guy?

18:55.259 --> 18:57.557
What are you talking about?

18:58.888 --> 19:03.689
You went behind my back when I specifically
said I wanna deal with the guy...

19:03.851 --> 19:06.695
and you fucked him?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.856
- Um...
- That's you being the captain?

19:09.023 --> 19:14.530
Look, what I did is I made a calculated
business decision for the two of us.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.073
- Oh, it was a business decision?
- Yes.

19:17.239 --> 19:22.040
- Fucking a stranger in a bathroom?
- You fuck strangers all the time.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.796
That's my job.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.125
- Oh, is that...? Is that...?
- No.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.090
- Hey, guy. Hey, fella.
- Ray, don't. Don't.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.220
- Come on, Ray. Ray!
- Hey!

19:32.380 --> 19:34.508
- Ray! Oh, my God.
- Hey!

19:34.674 --> 19:37.598
- Okay, shit. Shit.
- Hey!

19:40.096 --> 19:41.393
Hey!

19:48.020 --> 19:50.864
Hey. Hey, fella.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.151
Oh, hey, man.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.570
- Do I know you?
- Don't play dumb.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.862
I'm Ray, you're Jason.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.491
Look, I don't know what Tanya
told you or Lenore told you...

20:00.658 --> 20:03.002
or Miss It's-Always-My-Birthday
told you...

20:03.160 --> 20:07.131
so I'm gonna tell you:
Stay away from my clients.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.543
- I didn't know she was your client.
- Don't bullshit me. You knew.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.054
No, I'm not. I had no idea.

20:13.212 --> 20:18.059
But honestly, man, I don't think
she missed you that much.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.560
No offense.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.140
- If you take one of my clients again...
- I'm just trying to make them happy.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.105
I think I made your pimp happy.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.941
- Hey!
- I don't wanna fight you, man.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.356
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- Hey, come here.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.195
Come here!

20:35.818 --> 20:37.991
Hey! Hey!

20:47.496 --> 20:49.794
<i>I didn't mind the running.</i>

20:49.957 --> 20:52.335
<i>It was the breathing
that was the problem.</i>

20:52.501 --> 20:53.502
Damn it.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.224
You okay?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.731
I can't believe
you slept with that guy.

21:11.479 --> 21:14.278
- He's like 12.
- He is not.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.535
He's at least 20-something.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.790
- Why do you care so much?
- Because you shouldn't have done it.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.751
- We're a team.
- Yeah, a team.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.791
But I'm not your backup.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.591
You know, sometimes I think you
underestimate just how valuable I am.

21:41.467 --> 21:45.347
- Ow!
- You should get that looked at.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.482
It's a bruised rib, Tanya.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.235
I'm an athlete.
I've been through worse.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.524
What are we gonna do about this punk?

21:57.817 --> 22:02.914
- I don't know.
- Come on, broken windows.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.370
We gonna give it up to Lenore?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.706
- No.
- Hell, no.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.962
Let's go get our client back.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.972
Oh, my God. Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.677
Okay, where were we?

22:21.841 --> 22:24.344
Take your seats.
Let's see, was that the... 'Z

22:24.510 --> 22:27.059
Types of orgasm.
Types of orgasm, right?

22:27.221 --> 22:31.772
You know, there are
more than you think, right?

22:32.101 --> 22:34.195
Okay. Let's see.

22:34.353 --> 22:40.531
First we'll start with clitoral orgasm.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.912
Okay, so when...

22:43.612 --> 22:45.910
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Miss Skagle.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.703
- I'm one of your students.
- No.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.837
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.998
- I'm going to enroll.
- No.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.337
I've heard such great
things about this class.

22:56.500 --> 23:03.133
I've got my check and my class
registration form all ready to go.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.972
I need this class.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.762
I've had such a tough
couple of months...

23:07.928 --> 23:10.852
and I've had several people
close to me betray me.

23:11.015 --> 23:15.065
And along the way
I've lost myself and my sexuality.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.026
I was hoping you could
help me reclaim it, Tanya.

23:18.188 --> 23:23.365
Right, okay. You and I, we'll go
talk about this in my office.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.495
And...

23:25.905 --> 23:30.661
So the green pamphlet on handjobs...

23:31.076 --> 23:34.000
You have no right to come
barging into my classroom...

23:34.163 --> 23:36.006
let alone hacking into my e-mail.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.384
- You've been stealing my clients.
- Your clients?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.544
If I remember correctly,
they are my clients.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.305
This center, selling lifestyle,
my idea.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.011
I am just taking back what is mine.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.721
I am changing my passwords, Lenore.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.478
You are not going to be able to hack
into my computer“

23:49.637 --> 23:52.106
Oh, really? Okay, let's see.
Christina Rutland.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.608
- Eloise Kuzenski.
- Where did you get that information?

23:54.767 --> 23:55.859
- Caroline Powell.
- Where?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.521
Birthday girl was just a demo.
I want my clients...

23:58.687 --> 24:01.566
50 percent of your profits
and an apology.

24:01.732 --> 24:05.236
- Or what?
- Or I take it all.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.409
Hey!

24:07.571 --> 24:09.665
You want it? Fish it out of the toilet.

24:09.823 --> 24:13.043
- What the fuck?
- That's right. Oh, my God.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.670
Toilet water. Toilet water.
Quit it! Tea-brain.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.524
Chapstick?

24:36.225 --> 24:38.819
Ow! Ow.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.448
What are you gonna do now, Tanya?
Throw a teabag at me?

24:42.606 --> 24:44.324
You're never gonna make it.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.783
Not in this business,
not in Detroit, not in life.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.323
You're a loser, Tanya.

24:50.489 --> 24:54.995
- Once a loser, always a loser.
- You are a broken window.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.802
Okay, hi.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.892
Well, okay.

25:14.054 --> 25:18.605
Nobody said Orgasmic Living
was easy, ladies.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.485
So where were we?

25:20.644 --> 25:25.400
Miss Bernard will not be
attending class today.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.910
Okay. Uh...

25:32.948 --> 25:34.791
Vaginal.

25:41.582 --> 25:45.337
- Hey, hey, man.
- Thanks.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.513
- Which one?
- Same.

25:50.549 --> 25:54.270
- Mm. What's in the box?
- Um...

25:56.472 --> 25:58.145
A bigger cake.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.277
She likes cake.
You think that's gonna do it?

26:01.435 --> 26:03.984
- Do what?
- Give you an edge.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.819
Bigger cake?

26:06.732 --> 26:09.827
- Maybe.
- Hmm.

26:10.277 --> 26:15.249
Why don't you just go home, man?
You know it's gonna be me.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.375
All right.

26:25.334 --> 26:29.384
- What, just like that?
- Yeah, you want her, you got her.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.724
Here, take the cake.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.385
- All right. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.565
Ah! Fuck.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.692
Oh, come on, man. Are you serious?

26:43.227 --> 26:45.355
Ah! Ah!

26:46.146 --> 26:50.743
She's expecting me tonight, pal.
And that's what she's gonna get.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.403
Good luck.
