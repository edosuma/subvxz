WEBVTT

00:07.883 --> 00:09.844
I always felt lucky
I outlived you,

00:09.927 --> 00:12.012
but maybe I should be jealous.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.681
You have quite the spread here.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.266
Well,
you're the older brother now,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.101
so that's some consolation.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.103
So, to what do I owe this visit?

00:19.186 --> 00:22.314
The board is voting today.
Want to give me your proxy?

00:24.650 --> 00:26.527
I'll cast my own vote, thanks.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.362
You know the rules.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.156
You have to be there in person.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.782
Oh, I intend to be.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.160
Father always said to check up
on important things yourself.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.329
Well, not that
I don't trust you,

00:37.413 --> 00:40.708
but Father also said
not to trust you.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.005
David Choak is
downloading off the system

00:46.088 --> 00:48.424
to Baskin Robots in Manhattan.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.928
2552 West 43rd Street,

00:53.012 --> 00:55.264
New York City, 10036.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.060
Call Nathan.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.771
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.148
Um, hey, what are you
up to today?

01:04.231 --> 01:05.649
Not much.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.235
Uh, want to go
on a field trip with me?

01:08.319 --> 01:09.862
To New York City?

01:09.945 --> 01:13.157
Yes. Yeah... I mean,
you know, if you want.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.617
It'd be cool.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.826
Also, how exactly
would I do that?

01:15.910 --> 01:17.453
Uh, you would buy

01:17.536 --> 01:21.874
a Reality Private Tour
and ask for me as your guide.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.169
It's just one long
FaceTime call,

01:25.252 --> 01:29.548
uh, but it's fun, and, um,
I-I could, I could use a break.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.842
Yeah, I could use
a little vacation, too.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.011
Your life is a vacation.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.763
I know, and it's exhausting.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.556
I could use a vacation from it.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.393
You want to take a day trip
to Manhattan?

01:41.477 --> 01:42.561
Oh, hell yeah.

01:42.645 --> 01:44.855
I've always wanted
to see the infamous Bean.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.398
That's Chicago.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.859
Then the, uh, bridge.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.402
- Which one?
- Hamilton?

01:50.486 --> 01:51.946
Close enough.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.906
Yeah, this is gonna be great.
The girls will be pumped.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.157
Girls?

01:55.241 --> 01:57.284
Really?
I'm Papoose-loading Luke?

01:57.368 --> 01:59.161
I thought you'd be happy.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.540
Oh, wait,
is it weird now between you guys

02:02.623 --> 02:05.251
'cause of the whole
sex dream thing?

02:05.334 --> 02:07.670
Uh, nuh-uh. I do not do weird.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.964
- Hi.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.049
Hola.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.510
Uh, surf's up, dude.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.013
What the fuck?

02:19.098 --> 02:20.599
All right, let's go.

02:20.683 --> 02:21.934
Check this out.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.143
Help us!

02:23.227 --> 02:24.728
They're kidnapping us!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.648
- Somebody!
- Help!

02:29.066 --> 02:31.193
You know we can mute these fools
at any time.

02:31.277 --> 02:34.113
Aleesha, don't forget to buy
your chlamydia pill.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.118
I'm clean, y'all.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.801
- Coming.

02:55.885 --> 02:57.887
Oh, if this is
a singing telegram,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.471
I'm not interested.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.224
Oh, Ms. Kannerman, we're here
for an in-home inspection.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.184
For what? Oh, bugs?

03:04.268 --> 03:06.437
Are you still interested
in a digital baby?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.939
If so, then we need
to look around and make sure

03:09.023 --> 03:10.357
you can properly care for one.

03:10.441 --> 03:12.985
If not, and I feel like
that would be a good call,

03:13.068 --> 03:14.194
we'll be out of your hair.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.572
Uh, why would that be
a good call?

03:16.655 --> 03:19.408
You set the record
for the practice AI.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.911
Birth to death
in under 24 hours.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.662
What were you doing with it?

03:23.746 --> 03:25.372
- Excuse me?
- Ms. Kannerman

03:25.456 --> 03:28.334
tried her best, and babies
can be very demanding.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.545
And I can imagine, uh,
it can be really frustrating

03:31.629 --> 03:35.591
to deal with demanding, entitled
babies all day, every day.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.760
Okay, okay, I am sorry,
but how is it

03:37.843 --> 03:40.012
that you three
are fit to judge me?

03:40.095 --> 03:42.973
The-the brainless scarecrow,

03:43.057 --> 03:44.516
the tin man and...

03:44.600 --> 03:46.143
and the cowardly incel?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.978
- Am I the incel?
- Well...

03:48.062 --> 03:49.772
I think that what

03:49.855 --> 03:52.024
she meant to say was that

03:52.107 --> 03:55.361
you're single
and, um, and lonely.

03:55.444 --> 03:57.529
Which,
so am I, so big deal.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.240
- Sure.
- I, too,
am programmed for celibacy.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.992
I am not programmed
for celibacy!

04:02.076 --> 04:03.619
- Okay.
- Don't touch me!

04:03.702 --> 04:05.412
- Sorry.
- I'm in a relationship.

04:05.496 --> 04:07.581
Ms. Kannerman,
we have to grade you

04:07.665 --> 04:09.500
on a sliding scale
of six characteristics

04:09.583 --> 04:11.502
to determine
if you'll be a good mom.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.171
And... Oh!
Look at the first one.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.881
"Kindness."

04:15.965 --> 04:17.299
Zero.

04:17.383 --> 04:18.801
Okay, uh, you know what?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.636
Why don't you come on in? Okay?

04:20.719 --> 04:23.472
- Oh.
- And you can help yourself
to the bar.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.224
- Oh, thank you.
- You make yourselves at home.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.142
All right?

04:27.226 --> 04:30.104
Upload and beyond
for free. Freeyond.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.939
Back and better than ever.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.775
Open in five days.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.777
Upload and beyond for free.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.612
Freeyond.
Back and better than ever.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.531
No sitting,
I want to look out the window.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.247
Where are we going?
Is there a plan?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.832
Yeah, yeah,
I was thinking we could start

04:49.915 --> 04:51.875
at, um, 43rd and 11th.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.419
Hell's Kitchen?

04:53.502 --> 04:56.213
Look, we'll just get all the
touristy stuff out of the way.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.590
I got food poisoning
from that place. Twice.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.260
Next stop,
the Brooklyn Bridge.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.179
Aleesha, turn towards
the window, I want to see it.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.267
Oh, wait, Aleesha. Oh, oh.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.645
You see?
You happy now?

05:21.530 --> 05:25.034
#RobotofGreed spotted
in Midtown Manhattan.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.161
What an asshole.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.417
Nora, what's going on?

05:36.211 --> 05:38.213
Can, uh, can Luke hear us?

05:39.965 --> 05:42.051
No, he has other things
on his mind.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.512
So, Choak downloaded
into a robot body this morning.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.723
I think he may be
up to something.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.933
And I may have posted
#RobotofGreed,

05:50.017 --> 05:54.605
which is now trending,
so we can follow him all day.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.273
Oh, my God, I love you.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.524
Yeah, I know.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.318
I heard your thoughts
with MindFrisk, remember?

05:59.401 --> 06:02.237
- Uh, no, that-that was from...
- No, I know.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.573
- I'm not hitting on you.
- Oh, I-I know. I-I didn't,

06:04.656 --> 06:06.033
- I didn't think you...
- I just mean that
you're brilliant.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.534
We can finally follow
this old fuck

06:07.618 --> 06:10.079
and find out
why he had me killed.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.667
Uh, change of plans.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.253
Look, we-we're gonna get off
at the next stop.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.758
What's at the next stop?

06:22.841 --> 06:27.679
Oh, uh, well, Nathan
wanted to see Choak Tower

06:27.763 --> 06:29.556
- for some reason.
- Uh...

06:29.640 --> 06:31.767
yeah, yep. Yeah, you know, uh,

06:31.850 --> 06:33.602
he asked me to check in on it.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.437
You know? Give it a little peek.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.232
A boo. A peekaboo.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.942
Someone else talk.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.077
Wow.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.831
Oh.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.833
Oh, my God.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.793
You could drown
in all these clothes.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.837
I like shoes, okay?

06:59.920 --> 07:03.090
What's it like to feel
your body in silk and cashmere?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.716
What's it like to feel
your body?

07:04.800 --> 07:07.261
- What's it like to feel?
- Oh, my God, okay.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.930
So, I'm sorry, what is this
stage of the adoption process

07:10.013 --> 07:12.683
where you-you touch
all of my belongings?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.435
This is the personal vanity
sliding scale.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.354
On one end
we have "materialistic"

07:17.437 --> 07:20.858
and on the other
we have "compassionate."

07:20.941 --> 07:22.025
Well, that's not fair.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.778
You can be compassionate
and materialistic.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.738
So what if I love shoes
more than anything?

07:26.822 --> 07:29.741
If I love a child half as much,
that's still a lot of love.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.536
I'm gonna give you a one.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.288
- Out of two?
- Out of ten.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.249
- What?

07:37.332 --> 07:38.667
- Oh...
- Oh, my God.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.085
- Oh, honey.
- Can someone...?

07:40.169 --> 07:41.879
Oh, no, no, no...
No.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.381
Well, this is humble.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.300
I expected no less.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.476
Boring.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.020
No, no, no, no. This is...

07:58.103 --> 08:00.022
This is super cool.
I mean, it's not every day

08:00.105 --> 08:01.982
that you're neighbors with a guy
who owns his own building.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.610
I had to come
check it out, really.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.487
And I also

08:07.571 --> 08:10.240
lost my virginity here, so...

08:10.324 --> 08:12.534
Okay. Weird.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.787
Next stop,
Empire State Building, huh?

08:15.871 --> 08:18.916
Aleesha, giddyap.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.710
This is the longest day
of my life.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.056
Wait.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.558
Freeyond? In Choak's tower?

08:36.642 --> 08:38.727
That's fucking ironic.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.979
I mean, do you think
it's a coincidence?

08:41.063 --> 08:43.649
It's Choak's tower. Why would
he be leasing space to Freeyond?

08:43.732 --> 08:45.067
Good optics, maybe?

08:45.150 --> 08:46.485
You know, makes him
look like a good guy

08:46.568 --> 08:48.487
to have a cool nonprofit
in his building?

08:48.570 --> 08:51.323
Right, what if Kannerman
and Choak bought your code

08:51.406 --> 08:53.033
and then sold it to Freeyond?

08:53.116 --> 08:55.369
- I mean, they're so similar.
- Doesn't make sense, though.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.120
Freeyond doesn't have the money
to buy anything.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.749
What if they gave them the code?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.210
Then why have me murdered?
To cover up their one good deed?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.130
Yo, the observation deck

09:07.214 --> 09:10.259
at the Empire State Building
is 150 bucks per person.

09:10.342 --> 09:14.054
- Nuh-uh.
- But it's a once-in-a-lifetime
thing.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.224
Or in your case,
a never-in-a-lifetime thing.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.185
Ouch. Rub it in, why don't you?

09:29.653 --> 09:32.906
Aleesha, jump up on that bench,
be the Jack to my Rose.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.450
Uh, I'm good.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.245
Come on, just hold me up,
over the prow.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.713
Oh!

09:47.796 --> 09:51.425
I'm flying, Jack. I'm flying.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.593
I'll never let go, Jack.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.013
No. No, no, no, I'm Rose.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.557
You're dead. You got to be Jack.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.475
Hey, get down from there!
This ain't a damn playground!

10:03.395 --> 10:04.604
Shit.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.024
Well, he's headed to...

10:07.107 --> 10:09.985
Uh, hey, hey, guys,
let's go to the High Line.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the High Line. Oh.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.322
Love a good stroll.
It's a great stroll.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.073
Awesome stroll. You guys
want to go for a stroll?

10:15.157 --> 10:16.783
I'm hungry and my feet hurt.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.452
- Let's sit and eat.
- Yeah.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.871
Let's stroll.
I love a good stroll.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.415
Down to stroll.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.960
- Come on.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.605
What are you doing in NYC?
You're dead.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.566
Oh.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.109
Oh, hey, Jerry.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.861
You left your shampoo and
conditioner by the sink again.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.279
Everything okay at home?

10:54.363 --> 10:56.114
If everything was okay at home,

10:56.198 --> 10:58.867
I wouldn't be conditioning
my balls in the work sink.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.411
Jesus Christ,
I just washed my face there.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.330
That's really
fucking disturbing.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.675
It's not pleasant,
but it's not corpsey.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.303
You must have smelled a number
of corpses in your line of work.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.305
What's your opinion?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.226
No.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.353
Thank you.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.938
Ingrid?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.856
"Ability to nurture."

11:29.940 --> 11:31.650
Hmm.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.068
Half a point.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.404
Oh, God.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.574
Oh, see, that's a nice smile.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.910
That wouldn't make me
uncomfortable if I was a baby.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.623
Hello?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.543
Looks like she's having
some me time and ignoring us.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.088
Amazing.
So much privilege.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.715
All right,
come on.

11:55.799 --> 11:56.716
Out of the tub.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.093
You can't tell me what to do.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.553
I'm a grown woman.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.471
You can't get clean
with your clothes on.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.558
Okay, sweetie, listen,
whatever is going on here,

12:04.641 --> 12:06.435
we can work it out.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.687
What do you care?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.856
You're just embarrassed.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.191
Yes, quite.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.986
Why can't you have a normal
addiction to, like, cocaine

12:16.069 --> 12:18.530
or bath salts, instead
of pretending to be dead?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.240
This is humiliating.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.754
- Oh...
- Les Abats.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.382
This looks really nice.
You guys want to check it out?

12:37.466 --> 12:40.093
- You got to be kidding me.
- No, you said you were hungry.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.971
For bankruptcy? No, thanks.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.599
I know a place
where we can fill up for cheap.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.856
What's he even having?
Motor oil?

12:52.939 --> 12:55.192
Okay, you got what you wanted.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.904
I am out of the tub,
and now I need you two to leave.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.739
Why?

13:00.822 --> 13:02.491
You have places to be?

13:02.574 --> 13:05.243
Good one, Mommy.

13:05.327 --> 13:08.163
- I do, actually.
- Ingrid,

13:08.246 --> 13:11.541
there's not a living soul
waiting for you anywhere.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.460
Unless you mean the you-know-who

13:13.543 --> 13:15.170
that your father
you-know-whatted.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.672
And he doesn't count.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.050
Wow.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.427
You know I'm gonna have
a family of my own one day?

13:22.511 --> 13:24.304
Yeah.

13:24.387 --> 13:28.058
And I'm gonna be the mother
that I never had.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.393
I'm gonna be kind,

13:30.477 --> 13:33.730
nurturing, supportive.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.441
And, oh, you know what?
It might be too ambitious,

13:36.525 --> 13:39.152
but I'm not gonna make
my child feel like

13:39.236 --> 13:42.614
they were the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

13:42.697 --> 13:45.992
Such a flair for drama.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.703
You weren't the worst thing.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.419
What's happening?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.505
All your eyes
keep moving around.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.344
You get
the company credit card,

14:04.427 --> 14:07.222
you go to Falafel Halal
for fried chickpea balls?

14:07.305 --> 14:10.892
Uh, dead guy, you've never had
these fried chickpea balls.

14:10.976 --> 14:15.146
Plus, we saved enough for some
classy rosé-all-day shit,

14:15.230 --> 14:17.649
since I get
the employee discount.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.234
You work there, too?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.361
Four nights a week,
graveyard shift.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.571
I'm the nighttime manager now.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.864
Falafel cutlets,
gentlemen,

14:24.948 --> 14:27.242
digital baba ghanoush,
sparkling Prosecco.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.370
- Okay, got it.
- Bon appétit.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.707
Wow, that is a lot of onion.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.167
I'm not kissing anybody.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.341
That's the real world, isn't it?

14:43.425 --> 14:45.176
Look at the color.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.387
The richness of the design.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.514
- Okay, that'll do it.
- Okay, thank you.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.975
We're done now.
You can leave.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.235
Damn. Can you imagine?

15:02.319 --> 15:05.030
“Floor to ceiling windows,
a kitchen island."

15:05.113 --> 15:07.824
- Windows and a kitchen.
- Yeah.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.493
That place is,
if I was gonna guess a number,

15:10.577 --> 15:12.162
out of your price range.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.831
If I got promoted,
I could swing it.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.499
Yeah, but do you really
want that?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.335
A bedroom bigger than my torso?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.503
Uh, yeah. Sign me up.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.964
The place I'm in now is
an old shipping container,

15:23.048 --> 15:24.883
and I still need roommates.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.594
Yeah, well,
the higher up you go at Horizen,

15:27.677 --> 15:30.555
the sketchier shit
they'll ask you to do.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.432
That's just how
capitalism works.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.809
- I thought you liked Lakeview.
- Yeah, but Lakeview

15:34.893 --> 15:36.811
should be more like this.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.898
You know? Central Park, where...

15:39.981 --> 15:41.941
people come and go
as they please.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.028
It's just...
You don't have to pay to exist.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.238
Yeah, people would
get behind that.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.823
But Horizen already
owns Lakeview.

15:48.907 --> 15:52.243
Yeah, but their tech was
developed with public money

15:52.327 --> 15:54.162
and they get subsidized power.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.164
Well, not all of us
can make money

15:56.247 --> 15:57.874
being community organizers.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.542
- No, but...

16:04.255 --> 16:05.757
Hey, I got an idea.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.842
Why don't we go to Queens?

16:07.926 --> 16:09.636
You know, see how real
New Yorkers live?

16:09.719 --> 16:10.887
Your guys' life.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.181
- No.
- Yeah, man, let's do it.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.100
Love it.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.395
Great. Queens.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
- Whee.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.443
♪ Not an ounce of gas,
I would get up there...

16:25.527 --> 16:28.154
Hey, guys, check it, those kids
go to my old high school.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.031
Mighty Mighty Maspeth!

16:31.741 --> 16:33.201
What were you like
in high school?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.786
Uh...

16:34.869 --> 16:39.249
I had a 94 average. Average.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.377
What, so, okay, what, I mean,
basically, I was a genius.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.880
I miss high school.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.591
The basketball team,
my dance troupe.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.218
The sewing club.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.886
Wait, you did all those things?

16:51.970 --> 16:54.472
I was athletic
and crafty as hell.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.307
I bet we all
would have been friends.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.809
- Oh, uh...

16:57.892 --> 17:00.061
I got to take this. One sec.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.523
Choak's stopped
about a mile away.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.151
12300 Jamaica Parkway.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.652
Okay, let's go.

17:09.779 --> 17:15.034
Okay, so... this was
my senior recital dance.

17:15.118 --> 17:17.162
Kick ball change,
double pirouette,

17:17.245 --> 17:19.038
row the boat,

17:19.122 --> 17:21.374
now take the boat back,
flip that boat,

17:21.458 --> 17:23.376
dip it low, pick it up slow.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.962
I think I missed

17:26.045 --> 17:30.675
the boat part of the dance.

17:30.759 --> 17:35.388
Maybe just, maybe run it back,
start from the top.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.317
Uh, where's Judgy and Dopey?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.444
They went to check
your settings,

17:49.527 --> 17:51.279
but it seems like
you're working again.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.864
Oh, yeah, yeah. I...

17:52.947 --> 17:54.365
I don't really know
what that was.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.993
It must have been some kind
of glitch or something.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.078
Can I ask you one last question
to finish the vetting process?

17:59.162 --> 18:01.247
Okay. Whatever.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.500
Why are you pretending
to be uploaded?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.920
What... um...

18:07.003 --> 18:08.463
How do you...

18:08.546 --> 18:11.216
- I thought so. Wow.
- No. Look, look, look, look.

18:11.299 --> 18:15.261
I am paying gigantic amounts
for this to be kept private.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.347
I am literally blocked
from telling anyone.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.975
But if you're alive,

18:21.059 --> 18:22.936
and you could be roaming
around the real world

18:23.019 --> 18:26.272
doing anything you wanted,
why are you here?

18:28.024 --> 18:30.652
Because...

18:30.735 --> 18:33.363
Because I love him.

18:33.446 --> 18:37.075
And when you love someone,
you will do anything

18:37.158 --> 18:38.910
just to be close to them.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.537
It's an emotion.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.623
I don't really expect you
to understand.

18:43.706 --> 18:47.168
I understand that you

18:47.252 --> 18:50.588
have spent a long time,
with no end in sight,

18:50.672 --> 18:53.633
doing something uncomfortable
out of love.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.303
Approved, for one digital baby.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.097
I think that we're gonna...

18:59.180 --> 19:01.975
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

19:04.769 --> 19:08.106
- We did it.
- I'm gonna be a mom.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.108
I'm gonna be a good mom.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.157
It should be on this block.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.453
There he is.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.123
And there he goes.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.792
But what was he doing
in this part of town?

19:33.756 --> 19:35.884
Freeyond.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.594
Why this location in Queens?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.095
Yeah, it's weird.

19:43.808 --> 19:48.021
Wait, there is only one Freeyond
retail store in New York.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.439
That can't be right.

19:49.522 --> 19:53.192
How many locations
in the United States?

19:53.276 --> 19:55.194
Looks like about 650.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.613
And only one in New York City?

19:56.696 --> 19:58.031
How many in Los Angeles?

20:00.325 --> 20:01.492
Only one.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.494
Where the fuck are they, then?

20:03.578 --> 20:04.913
I mean, you want to help
poor people, why not go

20:04.996 --> 20:07.457
where there are lots
of poor people?

20:07.540 --> 20:10.209
Wow. There are a hundred
Freeyond stores

20:10.293 --> 20:12.670
in Pennsylvania.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.548
96 in Wisconsin.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.842
75 in Michigan.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.510
180 in Florida.

20:21.512 --> 20:25.725
I mean, only one in L.A.
and almost 200 in Florida?

20:25.808 --> 20:27.101
Maybe this isn't about money,

20:27.185 --> 20:29.062
maybe it's about
political power.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.439
Freeyond is almost entirely
in swing states.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.150
- And uploads can't vote.
- You get enough poor
people to upload...

20:34.233 --> 20:37.362
- In the right precinct...
- You can tip an election.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.697
Oh, fuck me.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.950
That's why we've been doing
boring shit all day?

20:42.033 --> 20:43.785
- Aleesha...
- Some invitation.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.162
"We're gonna tour New York
on an expense account,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.789
have fun out of the office."

20:47.872 --> 20:51.000
I guess you didn't think
we'd come on some crazy stalk

20:51.084 --> 20:53.461
through your weird
murder obsession.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.880
Okay, we were doing
something else all day,

20:55.964 --> 20:57.548
but something important,
all right?

20:57.632 --> 20:59.467
Choak's disenfranchising
the poor.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.678
Oh, naughty.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.305
So maybe you had a boring day,

21:04.389 --> 21:06.641
but it was for a good cause,
Aleesha.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.267
Well, I didn't volunteer.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.895
You volunteered me.
There's a difference.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.022
And maybe I would have
if you asked,

21:13.106 --> 21:16.025
instead of pretending today
was about friendship.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.902
Well, maybe I didn't think
you would say yes

21:17.986 --> 21:19.654
if there was nothing in it
for you.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.991
I'm selfish?
That's what you're saying?

21:23.074 --> 21:24.784
Fuck you.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.755
Maybe you should go.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.257
Yeah.

21:42.844 --> 21:45.346
Okay, hey, let's maybe
slow it down a little bit.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.515
- I'm getting dizzy here.
- And she has the nerve

21:47.598 --> 21:50.143
to guilt-trip me
about working at Horizen

21:50.226 --> 21:52.395
when she's the one
that's been using me

21:52.478 --> 21:54.439
and lying to me
this whole damn day.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.525
Hey, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

21:57.608 --> 21:59.986
You have to try to better
yourself, however you can.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.654
- That's why I joined the Army.
- Damn right.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.656
You work multiple jobs

22:03.740 --> 22:05.408
in order to live
in a shipping container?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.243
Of course you want to move up.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.204
Nobody can judge you who hasn't
walked a mile in your shoes.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.498
I'm certainly not going to.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.918
Thanks.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.171
That actually makes me
feel better.

22:18.254 --> 22:21.716
Although
you don't judge anybody.

22:21.799 --> 22:24.093
Mildred straight-up said
that ugly people

22:24.177 --> 22:27.597
should be sterilized,
and you keep fucking her.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.724
Yeah.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.020
It's just so awful.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.356
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.734
These poor people
never catch a break.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.320
We'll figure something out,
all right?

22:42.403 --> 22:46.991
You keep hoping and you keep
fighting, and one day you win.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.994
- What if you don't?
- You know, even if you don't,

22:50.078 --> 22:54.207
I want to be one of the ones
who keeps fighting.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.085
Because something ugly happens
to you when you...

22:57.168 --> 22:59.921
when you stop fighting
and you stop hoping.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.965
Come on, I'll walk you home.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.570
Hi, Ms. Kannerman.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.990
I hear things are coming along,
should be ready soon.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.326
Uh, sorry it's taken so long,
but we can only speed things...

23:30.409 --> 23:32.453
and she's gone.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.580
Well, that's one way
to treat people.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.041
To be honest,
it wasn't easy.

23:37.125 --> 23:40.628
But I kept my eye on the prize
and got the approval.

23:40.711 --> 23:44.841
And one day... one day, I swear,

23:44.924 --> 23:47.468
I am not gonna fuck up
a little kid.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.849
The cycle ends with me.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.142
Okay?

23:55.268 --> 23:57.770
I promise.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.273
What do you think
of the name Noah?

24:00.356 --> 24:02.775
Yeah, it's been growing on me.

24:05.361 --> 24:09.407
Everything is going
to be perfect, Nathan.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.244
Just perfect.
