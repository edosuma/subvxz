BOB LEE:
Previously on "Shooter"...

00:08.376 --> 00:09.543
What can I do for you,
Captain?

00:09.577 --> 00:11.412
This was written
to the president.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.546
It states that in 21 days
he'll be executed.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.116
[gunshot, crowd screaming]

00:15.149 --> 00:16.484
Hey, Swagger.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.086
[gunshots]

00:18.119 --> 00:19.387
Stay on the ground now!

00:19.420 --> 00:20.454
Hands behind your head!

00:20.488 --> 00:22.223
My name is Bob Lee Swagger!

00:22.256 --> 00:23.524
I did not kill the president!

00:23.557 --> 00:25.393
All you had to do
was shoot him.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.828
I want my lawyer.
His name is Sam Vincent.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.198
The evidence is compelling.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.565
Does that sound like me?
I'll confess

00:31.599 --> 00:33.201
to trying to kill the president,

00:33.234 --> 00:35.136
but my wife and daughter
are left alone.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.604
What are you gonna do?

00:36.637 --> 00:39.273
I'm gonna do what I do best.
I'm gonna hunt.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.542
I don't like the unknown.
I'll deal with Swagger.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.544
NADINE: This whole thing
seems off.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.347
Do you believe me now?
Yes, I believe you now.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.082
I need you as an asset
inside the government.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.317
So are we partners?

00:49.350 --> 00:50.851
Memphis.
I think we found our shooter.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.386
BOB LEE: Lon Scott.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.554
NADINE: CEO of Anhur Dynamics?

00:53.587 --> 00:54.655
That doesn't make any sense.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.257
We've been hiring PMCs

00:56.290 --> 00:57.658
to handle off-book black ops.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.427
This has "war crimes"
written all over it.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.163
[speaks foreign language]
These so-called...

01:02.196 --> 01:03.497
NADINE: Karlina Ordenko
is dead.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.199
I believe a man
named Grigory Krukov

01:05.233 --> 01:06.700
gave the order
to have her killed.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.502
He's a high-ranking member
of the FSB.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.438
You're a drunk
with a security clearance.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.706
And you're that asshole who
thought he could outsmart me.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.242
If we don't start
working together--

01:14.275 --> 01:15.676
Together?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.445
ISAAC: You can't stop
these guys alone.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.380
I want $10 million
in uncut diamonds,

01:19.413 --> 01:22.116
or I'm going public
with the Annex B file,

01:22.150 --> 01:23.584
which I have in my possession.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.453
[grunts]

01:25.486 --> 01:28.256
[groans]
God, you're a dumbass.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.124
MEACHUM: Swagger's gone.
He's got Annex B.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.193
KRUKOV: Our mutual friends
will not be pleased.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.494
Good-bye, Mr. Meachum.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.497
Is that Daddy?
Where--where are you?

01:36.530 --> 01:38.299
You let them go,
I'll give you that shot

01:38.332 --> 01:39.367
you've been hoping for.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.603

01:42.636 --> 01:44.705
[explosion booms]

01:44.738 --> 01:46.340
JULIE: We have to find Mary.
Some man took her

01:46.374 --> 01:47.475
from the back of the van.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.343
Krukov has her.
I followed them,

01:49.377 --> 01:50.711
but I've gone
as far as I can go.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.613
What do you mean,
"as far as you can go"?

01:52.646 --> 01:59.620
*

01:59.653 --> 02:01.189
She's in Russia.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.659
[dramatic music]

02:05.693 --> 02:12.700
*

02:20.774 --> 02:24.645
Your name is Mary, yes?

02:24.678 --> 02:27.215
I am Grigory.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.184
I have a grandson
about your age.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.320
Sasha.
Very sweet boy.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.954
Where is he?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.757
He's at home
with his mother.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.263
Are you hungry?

02:45.233 --> 02:46.467
I will leave it here.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.403
Some cookies and milk.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.207
You are frightened,

02:53.241 --> 02:55.276
but you have nothing to fear.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.746
Your father has something
that belongs to us.

02:58.779 --> 03:02.450
When he gives it back,
you go home.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.184
Where's my mommy?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.421
Eat. Rest.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.390
This will all be over soon.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.364
JULIE: This is never
gonna work.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.332
The embassy is a fortress.
There's no other way.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.301
Then give Krukov
what he wants.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.669
Honey, if I believed
for one second

03:21.702 --> 03:22.703
that I could trust that guy,

03:22.736 --> 03:24.438
I would.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.508
They can't let us live
with what we know.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.809
NADINE: The ambassador's
at a cocktail party

03:28.842 --> 03:30.444
at American University.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.845
He should be there
for another two hours.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.715
That should fit.
Okay, Julie, you're up first.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.584
Your objective is
to distract the ambassador

03:36.617 --> 03:38.419
and his security team

03:38.452 --> 03:39.720
and then get them headed
back to the Embassy.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.723
Where is he? Where?
Where's the ambassador?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.024
Someone tell me. Where is he?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.459
WOMAN: What's going on?
MAN: What?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.361
You!
This is a private function.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.297
I want my daughter.
I'm sorry?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.464
I know you had her taken.
My daughter.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.433
She's at your embassy.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.535
I'm sorry. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.304
And don't you dare bullshit me.
[speaks Russian]

03:56.337 --> 03:57.738
No. Get off of me.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.440
NADINE: Isaac will be there
to validate the story

03:59.473 --> 04:00.874
and motivate the ambassador.
Excuse me, sir.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.476
You think you can
strong-arm me, but you can't.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.278
I'll go to the press.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.813
Excuse me, Ambassador.
She came to Homeland first.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.881
She was raising hell
in our office.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.650
Look. I'm truly sorry
about your trouble,

04:09.683 --> 04:11.585
but I have no idea who you are.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.755
I'm Julie Swagger,
Bob Lee Swagger's wife.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.624
My six-year-old was dragged
into your embassy

04:16.657 --> 04:17.791
by Grigory Krukov.

04:17.825 --> 04:22.062
[people murmuring indistinctly]

04:22.095 --> 04:23.897
I'm sorry, Mrs. Swagger,

04:23.931 --> 04:26.534
but I have nothing
to do with this.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.736
[speaks Russian]

04:28.769 --> 04:30.438
You're a liar.
I'm going to the press.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.772
Everyone is gonna know.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.507
I'm going to the press
with everything!

04:33.541 --> 04:34.908
BOB LEE: Once I get
into the embassy,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.610
how do I find Mary?

04:36.644 --> 04:38.912
I have the plans
for all three floors right here.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.514
It's big,

04:40.548 --> 04:41.515
but the public stuff--

04:41.549 --> 04:42.850
conference rooms, offices--

04:42.883 --> 04:44.418
it's all on the first
and second floor.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.719
The secret shit is
in the basement.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.855
Any luck with the ambassador's
security team?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.831
This one.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.800
When you get Mary, meet us
at the surveillance point

04:59.833 --> 05:01.669
at K Street.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.537
Once you're all safe,
we'll take it from there.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.539
Copy.
So, K Street, then we're done?

05:05.573 --> 05:07.808
You see my wife and kid,
you get paid.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.832
Let her go.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.568
I'm sorry. I do not know
what this is about.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.437
The scared little six-year-old
in the basement.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.638
Let her go.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.839
Mary Swagger.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.608
Who?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.777
That's cute.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.515
You know who I am.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.950
You are
the national security advisor.

05:49.983 --> 05:53.554
And yet here I am, standing
in the Russian embassy.

05:53.587 --> 05:57.658
Does that give you any sense
of how important this is?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.794
Swagger has Annex B.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.630
Pick a headline:

06:02.663 --> 06:04.898
"Complicated Government
Conspiracy"

06:04.932 --> 06:08.836
or "Six-Year-Old American Girl
Kidnapped by a Russian Spy"?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.406
Which one do you think
"The Post" will go with?

06:12.440 --> 06:15.409
In my country, we do not worry
about headlines.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.678
This isn't your country.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.614
Yes, it is.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.951
You'll want to get that.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.566
Give me Annex B!

30:36.135 --> 30:39.138
[phone buzzing]

30:41.573 --> 30:43.142
Julie?
Bob Lee!

30:43.175 --> 30:45.011
[Mary screams]
Bob Lee, help! Please.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.979
JULIE: Please help!
Krukov's here.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.647
I'm coming.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.650
*

30:51.683 --> 30:53.485
KRUKOV: Your time is up.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.954

30:54.987 --> 30:56.956
[gunshots]

30:56.989 --> 30:58.257
[both scream]

30:58.290 --> 31:05.831
*

31:09.701 --> 31:12.104
Your husband had to be a hero,
didn't he?

31:13.940 --> 31:15.641
Very American.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.211
[Mary screaming]

31:19.245 --> 31:21.914
KRUKOV: Where's your hero now?
Shit.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.249
Shoot at the car.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.253
Aim high and shoot, now.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.024
[gunshots]

31:32.058 --> 31:34.226
[bullets thudding]

*

32:06.292 --> 32:08.027
[exhales]

32:10.997 --> 32:13.099
Stay here.
Don't move, okay?

32:13.132 --> 32:14.333
Don't move.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.942
[shaky breathing]

32:24.743 --> 32:26.745
MARY: What happened?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.714
Daddy's here.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.950
[siren wailing]

32:33.419 --> 32:36.588
[indistinct radio chatter]

32:40.192 --> 32:42.261
JULIE: Oh, my God.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.996
Thank God you're okay.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.231
Is it really over?

32:45.264 --> 32:47.299
Yes, sweetie, it's over.
Yes.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.069
It's over, baby. Finally.
We can go home?

32:52.438 --> 32:54.306
NADINE: Bob Lee.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.774
No.
I'm sorry. I have to.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.143
No.
Jules, it's gonna be okay.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.310
Why?
Bob Lee Swagger,

32:58.344 --> 32:59.445
you're under arrest.
I promise you.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.113
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.448
Wait. Where's Isaac?
It's gonna be fine.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.316
You know he's innocent.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.685
I'm sorry, Swagger.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.688
[pensive music]

33:09.721 --> 33:17.029
*

33:17.063 --> 33:18.297
HOWARD: Why don't you
follow him?

33:18.330 --> 33:19.631
He could use a friendly face
right now.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.100
He should be allowed
to go home.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.668
He's still
the number one suspect

33:22.701 --> 33:24.270
in the assassination attempt
against the president.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.637
That hasn't changed.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.073
[engine turns over]

33:27.106 --> 33:28.640
*

33:28.674 --> 33:30.342
[taps]

33:30.376 --> 33:35.647
*

33:55.234 --> 33:58.204
Agents, un-cuff Mr. Swagger,
please.

34:08.314 --> 34:11.550
Okay, Mrs. Gregson,
we're here,

34:11.583 --> 34:13.319
against my better judgment.

34:13.352 --> 34:17.456
It's Ms. Gregson,
and I appreciate your trust.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.326
Bob Lee--
may I call you Bob Lee?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.596
Bob Lee, where is Annex B?

34:24.630 --> 34:26.498
My client has
no such knowledge--

34:26.532 --> 34:28.734
Mr. Vincent,
if this was a deposition,

34:28.767 --> 34:31.337
I wouldn't have emptied out
the ground floor of Langley.

34:31.370 --> 34:34.540
Bob Lee, Annex B?

34:35.841 --> 34:37.243
I don't have it.

34:37.276 --> 34:39.278
Maybe Hugh Meachum has it.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.779
He works in this building,
doesn't he?

34:40.812 --> 34:44.350
Mr. Meachum is
recently retired.

34:44.383 --> 34:48.620
And what does Mr. Swagger get
if he gives it to you?

34:48.654 --> 34:51.523
Complete exoneration
for the assassination

34:51.557 --> 34:53.359
of the Ukrainian president.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.594
He gets his life back.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.496
That's what you want,
isn't it?

34:57.529 --> 34:59.365
What if I want justice?

34:59.398 --> 35:01.833
You'll have to settle
for freedom.

35:01.867 --> 35:05.337
You're the national security
advisor, right?

35:05.371 --> 35:06.838
You advise the president

35:06.872 --> 35:09.641
on which foreign leaders
to meet with and where.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.444
[tense music]

35:12.478 --> 35:14.746
You're a smart one,
aren't you?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.582
*

35:16.615 --> 35:18.650
You put the president
of the United States

35:18.684 --> 35:20.619
in Seattle
with the Ukrainian president.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.389
Or maybe he asked you to.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.793
Do you recognize this rifle?

35:27.826 --> 35:31.330
It's a SABER-FORSST .338
precision tactical rifle.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.632
When was the last time
you saw it?

35:33.665 --> 35:35.434
At the assassination.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.337
Do you recognize this?

35:38.370 --> 35:39.838
It's a bullet.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.615
Ms. Gregson--

35:49.648 --> 35:51.817
I want Annex B.

35:51.850 --> 35:55.754
*

35:55.787 --> 35:58.524
Are you really willing
to die for this?

35:58.557 --> 36:00.626
Ms. Gregson, please
step away from the weapon.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.694
Last chance.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.697
[suspenseful music]

36:05.731 --> 36:07.533
*

36:07.566 --> 36:09.435
So be it.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.869
*

36:10.902 --> 36:12.471
[rifle clicks]

36:13.739 --> 36:15.774
Jesus Christ.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.711
I had the ATF do a more
thorough review of this rifle.

36:19.745 --> 36:23.515
Turns out somebody shaved the
firing pin down 2 millimeters,

36:23.549 --> 36:27.586
just enough
so that no one would notice.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.422
Mr. Vincent, please note
that the murder weapon,

36:30.456 --> 36:32.458
the only thing that links
Bob Lee Swagger

36:32.491 --> 36:33.759
to this whole conspiracy,

36:33.792 --> 36:35.727
does not fire.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.863
If that weapon can't fire,

36:37.896 --> 36:40.432
then Mr. Swagger
can't be the shooter.

36:40.466 --> 36:43.735
Bob Lee Swagger,
you are exonerated

36:43.769 --> 36:46.672
for the assassination
of the Ukrainian president.

36:47.973 --> 36:50.809
Now, I gave you
what you want.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.779
Give me Annex B.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.947
I can't give it to you.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.816
But I can tell you where it is.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.888
Why don't you give
the Russian ambassador a call?

37:02.921 --> 37:04.556
See if he checked the room

37:04.590 --> 37:06.958
where daughter
was held captive.

37:11.062 --> 37:15.801
The story is, Lon Scott
and Grigory Krukov went rogue,

37:15.834 --> 37:17.636
cooked up a plan to start a war

37:17.669 --> 37:19.671
from which they'd both profit.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.973
Lon took the shot that killed
the Ukrainian president

37:22.007 --> 37:23.709
and then framed you.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.444
They found compelling evidence

37:25.477 --> 37:27.513
when the FBI raided
his compound yesterday.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.684
Lon and Krukov
had a falling out.

37:32.718 --> 37:36.021
Lon killed Krukov
at the Rose Motel,

37:36.054 --> 37:37.523
then killed himself.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.659
That's a hell of a story.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.794
Russian ambassador's
gonna back the entire thing.

37:42.828 --> 37:43.795
He's working
with the State Department

37:43.829 --> 37:44.930
to clean it up.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.532
NADINE: What about Isaac?

37:46.565 --> 37:49.668
Nobody knows where he is.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.037
Well, I know a little girl

37:52.070 --> 37:54.773
who's gonna be thrilled to hear
that her father's free.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.575
Yes, she is.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.810
You go ahead, Bob Lee.
I've got a lot to do here.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.547
Nadine, when you're done here,

38:01.580 --> 38:02.814
I'm gonna need you in there.

38:02.848 --> 38:03.915
We're gonna need
a proper record.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.751
Of course.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.052
Thank you, Sam.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.957
Anytime, son.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.962
[clears throat]

38:16.995 --> 38:19.531
Memphis, I couldn't have
done it without you.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.799
You're an easy man
to believe in.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.100
I don't know about that,

38:22.133 --> 38:24.069
but you're one hell
of an FBI agent,

38:24.102 --> 38:26.705
and I hope your boss
knows that.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.874
I could write you
a letter of recommendation.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.842
[laughs]

38:30.876 --> 38:32.077
I'll let you know.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.014
Take care.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.551
You know what?
I have to ask,

38:39.585 --> 38:43.689
seeing as how we're
in the empty lobby of the CIA.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.724
You never even flinched
when Gregson fired that rifle,

38:45.757 --> 38:48.560
almost as if...

38:48.594 --> 38:49.861
you knew it wasn't gonna shoot.

38:49.895 --> 38:56.902
*

39:02.808 --> 39:03.942
What's your question?

39:03.975 --> 39:05.944
No one would believe it
anyway.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.013
Well...

39:09.715 --> 39:10.916
Good-bye, Marine.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.521
We'll work on that salute,
pork.

39:15.554 --> 39:22.561
*

39:26.932 --> 39:28.567
JULIE: Reach for this one.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.902
MARY: Reach, reach, reach.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.103
You're getting so good.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.139
[Mary giggling]

39:36.675 --> 39:38.109
MAN: Here you go, sir.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.717
Daddy's home!

39:45.751 --> 39:47.686
[gentle music]

39:47.719 --> 39:49.087
Hi, baby!

39:51.957 --> 39:55.093
You guys hungry?
Starving.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.963
It's lasagna night, right?
It is.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.199
Let's go home.

40:01.232 --> 40:08.574
*

40:10.976 --> 40:13.612
GREGSON: You wait here.
MAN: Yes, ma'am.

40:20.686 --> 40:24.022
[dramatic music]

40:24.055 --> 40:25.824
I don't have all night.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.158
I want out.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.860
No.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.697
I almost got killed.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.632
You volunteered.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.200
You knew the risks.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.143
I betrayed everything
I believed in for you.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.047
You got Meachum.
You got Krukov.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.982
There's nothing left.

40:51.016 --> 40:55.721
Meachum and Krukov were
just the tip of the iceberg.

40:55.754 --> 40:59.791
The real problem
is about to reveal itself.

40:59.825 --> 41:05.831
*

41:07.933 --> 41:10.235
You have other people
for that.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.070
No one like you.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.807
I'm done.

41:17.042 --> 41:19.110
Don't send anyone after me.

41:19.144 --> 41:25.050
*

41:25.083 --> 41:27.018
GREGSON: I won't have to.

41:27.052 --> 41:31.657
*
