00:14.180 --> 00:15.473
Take your time.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.019
There's no rush.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.899
We made it.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.444
We finally made it.

00:31.656 --> 00:32.531
Here.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.188
Who was that?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.196
Hey, look. Look.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.322
It's so beautiful!

01:15.366 --> 01:16.451
Amazing.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.205
It's a nice place, isn't it, Satoru?

01:21.289 --> 01:22.665
The air is crisp here.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.295
Can I have all the kids
gather around me?

01:27.378 --> 01:29.380
We'll go over a few precautions.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.841
-Sorry, Satoru, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.969
Okay, everyone gather up!

01:35.053 --> 01:36.137
Watch your step.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.180
Be careful!

01:43.895 --> 01:47.732
First, we'll be getting ready
for the barbeque.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.318
When you are using a knife,

01:50.401 --> 01:54.197
please make sure you do it
around an adult staff member.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.909
After the barbeque is finished,
we'll gather trash into groups,

01:57.992 --> 01:59.786
and bring them to this area.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.913
-Everybody understand?
-Yes!

02:01.996 --> 02:02.956
Nice answer!

02:03.373 --> 02:06.584
Okay, let's make this a fun and safe
camping experience.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.703
Oh, thank you.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.350
Mom?

03:06.269 --> 03:07.520
Something the matter?

03:08.897 --> 03:11.691
Mr. Yashiro was one of the volunteers.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.780
I'm obviously just joking!

03:18.406 --> 03:20.241
Kumi, cut the green peppers.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.701
-Okay.
-Can you do it?

03:21.784 --> 03:23.953
-Yeah, Kumi can do it.
-Really?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.330
Really.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.250
-That's really good.
-Is that all right?

03:47.101 --> 03:49.312
SLEEPING PILLS

04:07.914 --> 04:10.291
It tastes so good eating outside!

04:11.918 --> 04:14.879
This is my first barbeque
since grade school.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.714
Yeah, of course it is.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.091
You've been asleep since then!

04:19.591 --> 04:22.637
-Here's some meat.
-That looks so good!

04:23.221 --> 04:25.431
And they're doing fireworks tonight.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.142
Really? Seems like they planned a lot.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.728
There's a stamp rally event
after this, too.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.481
They said you get a prize if you win!

04:34.315 --> 04:37.694
Satoru, we're getting first place, got it?

04:40.530 --> 04:43.116
Kumi, fill up your canteen before you go.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.033
Okay!

04:45.034 --> 04:46.244
I'll go do that now.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.460
What's this?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.534
You can do it, Satoru! Got the stamp!

05:51.726 --> 05:53.978
The hint for the next stamp location

05:54.520 --> 05:58.524
is a happy musician
beyond the swaying ground?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.820
Swaying ground...

06:03.488 --> 06:04.363
A boat?

06:05.823 --> 06:07.241
Let's look at the map.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.916
Oh, I figured it out!

06:15.458 --> 06:17.668
The swaying ground is the rope bridge!

06:18.169 --> 06:20.004
And here's the happy musician!

06:21.964 --> 06:23.049
Why?

06:23.132 --> 06:25.843
Because tanukis
beat their tummies like a drum.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.389
All right! Well, let's go, Satoru!

06:46.614 --> 06:48.741
I knew this was the swaying ground.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.703
I was right!

06:53.663 --> 06:55.915
Kumi, don't sway it so much.

06:56.082 --> 06:56.916
Oh, sorry.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.255
It's so scary!

07:10.930 --> 07:12.223
Are you okay, Satoru?

07:30.741 --> 07:32.201
You can do it, Satoru!

07:32.493 --> 07:33.453
Yeah.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.164
We're almost to the second one.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.427
Got the second one!

07:51.554 --> 07:52.805
The next one is...

07:53.764 --> 07:54.599
I got it!

07:57.226 --> 07:58.936
Could we take a short break?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.690
You're still not 100 percent yet, huh?

08:09.822 --> 08:13.618
I bet the fireworks would look beautiful
from here. It's perfect!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.914
-What did you say, Kumi?
-Nothing.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.792
Anyway, come on, Satoru,
let's go to the next one already.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.511
Let's go.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.645
-Welcome back!
-Welcome back!

08:41.729 --> 08:45.107
Let's see, it looks like you
and Mr. Fujinuma finished 12th.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.526
Good job.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.985
-Good job!
-Welcome back.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.529
-Good work.
-Welcome back.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.364
You guys finished 13th.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.282
-Good job.
-Good job.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.326
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.663
Oh, welcome back, Kumi!

08:59.497 --> 09:03.125
We didn't win because Satoru
was too slow!

09:04.252 --> 09:05.628
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.880
Oh, hey, Satoru.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.132
Could I borrow your watch?

09:11.467 --> 09:14.971
I guess I forgot my phone,
and I don't know what time it is.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.681
Oh, okay.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.397
Oh, it's already four o'clock?

09:25.523 --> 09:27.400
I need to get dinner ready.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.987
I'm going to go help prepare
for the fireworks.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.322
What about you, Satoru?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.950
I'm getting a quick checkup,
then taking a break.

09:36.033 --> 09:39.537
Well, hurry up. There'll be a line
for dinner if you're late.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.830
Okay, I will.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.292
Okay, Satoru.
I'll see you for the fireworks.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.302
You know...

09:55.428 --> 09:58.347
you seem pretty happy
even though you didn't win.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.855
I guess I should probably
tell you at least.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.400
I wouldn't want to cause any worry.

10:27.668 --> 10:32.465
Hello, Kenya? I just stepped away from
Kumi. I'll be on my own for a while.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.177
Okay, I'll keep an eye on her from here.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.222
I don't want Yashiro to know
we're onto him.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.392
So, make sure he doesn't spot you.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.394
Okay, I will.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.278
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

10:56.447 --> 10:57.698
I remember now.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.367
All of it.

11:03.746 --> 11:04.580
All of it?

11:09.001 --> 11:11.337
Even the one who did everything to you?

11:12.838 --> 11:13.672
Yes.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.594
I can wait if you need some time
to process it all.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.388
Gaku Yashiro.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.016
Our teacher,

11:24.725 --> 11:25.935
Mr. Yashiro.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.112
Now he goes by the name Manabu Nishizono.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.199
<i>He's a councilman</i>
<i>for the city where you live.</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:43.160
So, it was him.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.997
You suspected Yashiro was the killer?

11:49.166 --> 11:50.000
I'm impressed.

11:51.752 --> 11:55.589
What I noticed was the model of the car
that fell in the lake.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.301
<i>The police knew it was the same model</i>
<i>as Yashiro's car,</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:02.263
<i>but they ultimately concluded</i>
<i>it was immaterial.</i>

12:04.223 --> 12:05.975
But I couldn't let it go.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.186
And I knew what you were doing.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.648
That's when I started to look into it.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.698
I'm going to go to this camp with Kumi.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.287
SASANQUA GET-TOGETHER

12:35.880 --> 12:36.797
This,

12:37.214 --> 12:39.758
"Economic Planning Committee Chairman,"

12:40.092 --> 12:42.928
is Yashiro. It's a trap, Satoru.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.848
You can't go, it's too dangerous.

12:46.849 --> 12:51.770
I see. Yashiro is probably planning
to kill Kumi there

12:52.313 --> 12:54.523
and frame you for the crime.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.026
Kenya.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.862
Let's turn his trap

13:00.738 --> 13:01.989
into an opportunity.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.952
-Satoru, you're not thinking of--
-I'm not planning on getting revenge.

13:08.829 --> 13:13.501
This time, I will get him arrested,
and have him admit his crimes.

13:18.339 --> 13:22.176
Yashiro will probably target Kumi,
like you said.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.887
If we can stop him,

13:25.596 --> 13:29.141
I think we'll be able to gather
enough evidence to put him away.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.233
I'm in, Satoru.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.653
It's our fate...

13:42.029 --> 13:43.489
to put an end to Yashiro.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.408
We'll guard Kumi care--

13:46.492 --> 13:47.326
No.

13:47.743 --> 13:51.539
I want Kumi to enjoy herself
and have a good time.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.124
But, Satoru...

13:55.376 --> 13:57.795
It's her first big trip since her surgery,

13:58.254 --> 14:01.257
and I want to give her a chance
to make new friends.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.471
Because having friends
is something special.

14:12.726 --> 14:16.730
We'll make sure Kumi has a good time
while we stop Yashiro's plan.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.483
If we can do that, then we win.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.573
Okay.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.789
Kids!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.709
We're going to start preparing
for the fireworks!

14:36.792 --> 14:39.545
Everyone, please gather around!

14:40.129 --> 14:42.464
-Okay, I'm going now, Sachiko.
-Okay.

14:43.632 --> 14:47.845
Please bring a blue sheet and a
folding chair from the admin building.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.140
It's over here.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.144
Here it is.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.273
Here.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.237
Here.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.155
Here. Here.

15:07.156 --> 15:07.990
Here.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.033
-Here.
-Here.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.546
It's almost time.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.145
LET'S GO PICK SATORU UP.
COME TO BUNGALOW F AT 4:30. - SACHIKO

15:38.729 --> 15:40.397
<i>I knew he'd use this tactic.</i>

15:45.152 --> 15:48.072
THIS IS SATORU. WAIT AT YOUR PLACE.
I'M ON MY WAY.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.203
Airi.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.291
This is Li'l P.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.418
-Cute, right?
-Kumi.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.297
Could we trade phones
just while we're at the campsite?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.215
What?

16:06.590 --> 16:11.095
It has all the numbers you'll need,
like your home and my mom's.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.016
I don't really get why,
but it's fine with me.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.102
-Here.
-Here.

16:33.575 --> 16:37.204
Kenya, Yashiro just messaged Kumi
to come to a bungalow.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.832
I'm going to try to lure him elsewhere
by mail.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.583
Keep watch for me.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.339
<i>This will ruin Yashiro's plan.</i>

16:49.174 --> 16:51.844
<i>Maybe he'll get desperate</i>
<i>and make a mistake.</i>

17:14.532 --> 17:16.076
You did it again, Satoru.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.579
He must have his memories back.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.815
This is it. This is the feeling.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.612
This is what it feels like to be alive.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.991
What a wonder this is, Satoru!

18:00.829 --> 18:01.747
Now.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.292
It's time for the next round.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.716
Ready? One, two... Is everybody ready?

18:15.761 --> 18:16.720
Yes!

18:16.804 --> 18:20.182
Okay, great.
Let's bring everyone here, then.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.017
Okay! Everyone follow me!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.811
Please follow her, kids!

18:24.311 --> 18:25.729
Okay?

18:25.813 --> 18:26.980
Satoru?

18:27.064 --> 18:30.526
Kumi is heading your way
with the other kids.

18:32.486 --> 18:36.115
Hey, you said he asked Kumi
to come to a bungalow?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.367
I'll go check it out.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.161
He might have left some evidence behind.

18:41.995 --> 18:42.996
It's Bungalow F.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.707
Just be careful.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.424
I came to check up on you
because you're late.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.136
Sorry, I was taking a little break.

19:02.015 --> 19:05.561
But, you know,
you've really built up your stamina.

19:07.604 --> 19:11.441
I'm relieved to see how much
you were able to walk.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.658
You always watch over me like that,
don't you?

19:20.409 --> 19:22.411
<i>Oh, I said it aloud.</i>

19:22.494 --> 19:24.371
Don't say that!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.540
It's embarrassing.

19:30.586 --> 19:34.673
Kumi should be here to pick me up soon.
I need to get back to the field.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.595
You'll be able to watch
the fireworks with us, won't you?

19:40.304 --> 19:41.972
What are you talking about?

19:42.514 --> 19:45.851
You asked Kumi to watch the fireworks
from somewhere else.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.227
What?

19:47.311 --> 19:48.812
Kumi told me.

19:49.855 --> 19:54.318
Satoru gave me a letter saying we should
watch the fireworks with the musician.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.573
I found it inside my backpack.

20:02.993 --> 20:06.371
LET'S WATCH THE FIREWORKS TOGETHER WITH
THE MUSICIAN PAST THE SWAYING GROUND.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.332
IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET! - SATORU

20:08.415 --> 20:11.877
I just love secrets and surprises!
They're so exciting!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.216
When did you learn to be so smooth?

20:18.467 --> 20:21.178
So, who is this musician?

20:22.512 --> 20:23.347
Musician?

20:24.598 --> 20:27.267
-And here's the happy musician!
-Why?

20:27.351 --> 20:30.145
Because tanukis
beat their tummies like a drum.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.397
So scary!

20:34.191 --> 20:37.069
I bet the fireworks
would look beautiful from here.

20:37.152 --> 20:37.986
It's perfect!

20:39.738 --> 20:41.114
What did you say, Kumi?

20:41.406 --> 20:42.449
Nothing.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.329
What's wrong, Satoru?

20:47.829 --> 20:50.207
I completely forgot something!
I need to go!

21:04.471 --> 21:05.681
Am I close?

21:16.483 --> 21:20.821
I guess it's a little further.
I don't remember it being this far.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.638
NEBARA ROPE BRIDGE

21:57.774 --> 22:00.235
<i>There's this troublesome thing out there</i>

22:00.319 --> 22:05.115
that easily disregards all the hard work
and analysis we do as doctors.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.370
Do you know what that is?

22:10.912 --> 22:11.747
No.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.999
Human will.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.917
Human will?

22:40.776 --> 22:43.236
I don't need a reason to save a friend.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.370
Next time, I'm going to stop it.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.545
Don't worry, we promise we'll protect you.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.598
I didn't give up on this
halfway through, so here we are.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.212
Satoru? Are you okay?

23:44.422 --> 23:45.590
Thank goodness.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.222
It seems that I got to her
a little sooner.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.224
Mr. Sawada!

23:54.766 --> 23:56.768
I got a message from Kenya.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.812
I was really worried.

24:00.147 --> 24:03.358
Don't worry,
I don't think Yashiro is onto us.

24:09.489 --> 24:13.160
Hey, do you have the letter
I wrote with you now?

24:14.786 --> 24:15.620
I do. Here.

24:25.046 --> 24:29.259
LET'S WATCH THE FIREWORKS TOGETHER WITH
THE MUSICIAN PAST THE SWAYING GROUND.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.927
IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET! - SATORU

24:33.722 --> 24:36.641
You've found a crack, Satoru.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.270
Yes.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.364
INBOX - SACHIKO FUJINUMA

24:51.448 --> 24:55.160
SACHIKO FUJINUMA: I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE SWAYING GROUND.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.456
<i>Yashiro has realized</i>
<i>that I have Kumi's cell phone.</i>

25:00.457 --> 25:03.376
<i>Which means this text is for me.</i>

25:04.836 --> 25:07.047
<i>He is waiting for me.</i>

25:08.423 --> 25:11.927
All that's left is to make
Yashiro admit to his crimes.
