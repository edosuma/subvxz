14:51.120 --> 14:53.800
So, what's your business, silver-lips?

14:53.880 --> 14:56.640
Um, I'm actually an officer of the law.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Working undercover, I take it.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.480
Yeah, well...

15:02.560 --> 15:05.480
Actually, I'm looking
for some countrymen of yours.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.080
Have you seen any?

15:07.160 --> 15:10.120
The only Brit I've met here
is Beefeater London Dry.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.680
Can I ask you a question?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.280
Yeah.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.600
Is it true what they say?

15:27.680 --> 15:30.760
That redheads have more fun?

15:30.840 --> 15:33.080
I believe the expression is about blonds.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.960
Oh. Playing hard to get, are we?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.560
Well, you...

15:38.640 --> 15:40.000
You have beautiful eyes.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.520
Uh, I...
Actually, I'm on duty, so...

15:46.600 --> 15:49.720
I, uh... Just...

16:01.080 --> 16:02.360
Oi.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.080
What's this mean?

16:04.160 --> 16:07.000
That's "nut allergy."

16:16.080 --> 16:18.600
Have you ever been bad?

16:20.200 --> 16:22.040
Well, uh...

16:22.120 --> 16:23.720
Fuck.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.160
[sighs, mutters]

16:35.240 --> 16:36.960
[David moans]

16:43.040 --> 16:44.720
[spits]

16:48.440 --> 16:49.920
[crashing]

16:51.640 --> 16:53.800
Good night, Sherlock.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.960
[David choking]

17:05.120 --> 17:07.360
[whirring]

17:21.560 --> 17:23.240
Huh?

17:29.520 --> 17:31.040
[in Norwegian]
What is going on here?

17:31.120 --> 17:33.240
[in English]
Oh, how you doing?

17:33.320 --> 17:36.600
Yeah, we thought the playground
could use a little more pizzazz.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.480
So we, uh, made a little donation.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.920
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.680
All we need from you
is a little consideration,

17:44.760 --> 17:47.560
help my kids
get into school a little sooner.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.360
[in Norwegian]
Do I understand you correctly?

17:49.440 --> 17:53.040
[in English] Are you trying to manipulate
the application queue

17:53.120 --> 17:55.440
with a tacky jumping castle?

17:55.520 --> 17:57.520
Yeah.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.400
If I have to,
I'll build you a Muriburi theme park.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.280
[air hissing]

18:07.360 --> 18:09.680
[in Norwegian]
Muriburi country is not for sale.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.880
And that plastic monster shall be
out of here within ten minutes

18:12.960 --> 18:15.080
or I'm gonna contact the police.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.400
Homo.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.200
[in Norwegian]
We want the bouncy castle!

18:29.440 --> 18:31.520
Wait a minute.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.520
Any of you kids speak English?

18:37.600 --> 18:41.400
How would you feel
about being the owners

18:41.480 --> 18:43.720
of that bouncy castle?

18:43.800 --> 18:45.520
[in English]
We would feel very good.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.400
[chuckles]

18:47.480 --> 18:49.560
I need you to do me a little favor.

18:49.640 --> 18:54.760
You know that, uh, Muriburi, uh,
puppet show thing?

18:54.840 --> 18:57.000
I need you to break it up.

18:57.080 --> 19:01.080
Really just ruin it completely,  capisce?

19:01.160 --> 19:03.080
- Capisce.
- [chuckles]

19:03.160 --> 19:07.760
Kid, you just became the king
of your own castle.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
[scolding in Norwegian]

19:23.120 --> 19:24.880
[in Norwegian]
What are you doing?

19:30.640 --> 19:33.120
Just pure luck that no one got hurt.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.880
But what exactly happened?

19:35.960 --> 19:37.680
Production error, of course.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.840
The gas tank must have blown up.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.680
It's electric.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.880
That's not the point.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.360
The point is I need a new one.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.160
I think there are a few things
we need to work out

19:49.240 --> 19:51.320
before that will be appropriate.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.440
For an Assistive Technology Division,

19:53.520 --> 19:56.120
you are not being very assistive.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.000
- That might be so.
- Hey!

20:00.040 --> 20:01.720
Hey!

20:01.800 --> 20:03.000
Torgeir!

20:03.080 --> 20:04.720
[whistles]

20:06.560 --> 20:09.440
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.080
Could you give me a quick ride
down to the diner at Tretten?

20:12.160 --> 20:17.240
Actually, I was heading home
for some frozen pizza.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.880
Frozen pizza.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.680
Sounds perfect.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.480
Oh.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.440
[birds chirping]

20:32.520 --> 20:35.440
[TV playing indistinctly]

20:59.320 --> 21:01.560

21:05.400 --> 21:07.200
[unzips]

21:07.840 --> 21:09.840
[urine trickles, stops]

21:11.200 --> 21:13.000
Come on.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.640
[in Norwegian] You better take off
the spikes. You'll ruin the floor.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.600
The floor can take a bang.
My back can't.

21:25.680 --> 21:26.800
[exhales]

21:26.880 --> 21:29.200
[singing]

21:31.880 --> 21:34.680
- Hello, Vidar.
- Where's the toilet?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.840
Up the stairs.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.600
Missed me?

21:39.880 --> 21:41.560
[singing]

21:43.520 --> 21:45.600
[urinating]

21:45.680 --> 21:48.760
[Terence continues singing]

21:51.840 --> 21:54.120
[urinating and singing]

21:56.120 --> 21:58.360
[singing continues]

21:59.880 --> 22:01.640
[toilet flushing]

22:04.520 --> 22:06.240

22:32.960 --> 22:34.160
[gunshots]

22:34.240 --> 22:36.480
[clicking]

22:38.960 --> 22:40.680
[in English]
Fuck.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.080
Jesus Christ.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.040
[in Norwegian]
This is exactly the kind of stress

22:45.120 --> 22:47.360
the doctor told me to avoid.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.240
[in English]
Asshole!

22:52.320 --> 22:54.560
[rock music playing]

23:02.760 --> 23:05.680
[in Norwegian] The fucking psycho
was waiting for us with a machine gun.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.240
In the toilet.
At home in my toilet.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.200
- If Roy hadn't been there...
- Who's guarding the door?

23:12.280 --> 23:13.760
I don't know.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.000
You must lock all doors and--
Hi. Are you English?

23:17.080 --> 23:18.200
[in English]
Are you English?

23:18.280 --> 23:20.160
[in Norwegian]
No, relax, I am Norwegian.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.920
Fine... [in English]
Have a good evening.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.360
- Torgeir, who guards the door?
- You guard the door.

23:24.440 --> 23:29.160
And don't let in any Englishmen.
Or anybody resembling one.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.960
See, what you do is you point

23:32.040 --> 23:34.000
the business end at the bad guys.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.040
And then just squeeze the trigger, huh?

23:37.120 --> 23:38.840
Like this, watch.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.480
- [knocking on door]
- Oh.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.240
Wait a minute.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.080
- [in English] These are the--
- [imitating gunshots]

23:47.160 --> 23:49.240
[laughing]

23:49.320 --> 23:53.040
[in Norwegian] Sure it's a good idea
to let him play with the piece?

23:53.120 --> 23:54.680
The safety was on.
What do you take me for?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.120
An irresponsible parent?

23:56.200 --> 23:59.400
[in Norwegian]
Meet the new security guys.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.960
[in English]
They are top-notch people.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.920
Yeah?
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.520
There's Tor Erik.

24:06.600 --> 24:11.240
He's, uh, just back
from Afghanistan, ex-military.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.560
Lasse, ex-cop,

24:13.640 --> 24:15.960
bounced for beating confessions
out of suspects.

24:16.040 --> 24:20.080
And say hello to my little friend,
Odd Johaug.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.840
Uh, done security on several
Hells Angels' Christmas parties

24:23.920 --> 24:26.400
and six years on a whaling ship.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.000
Eh, Odd Hog?

24:29.080 --> 24:31.120
Odd Johaug.
Johaug.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.880
Yeah, let's just make it Oddjob.
Okay with you?

24:33.960 --> 24:36.120
Whatever you say, sir.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.720
Good attitude.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.040
[rock music playing]

24:41.200 --> 24:42.680
[yelling indistinctly]

24:45.640 --> 24:50.080
How is it even possible to screw this up?

24:50.160 --> 24:51.760
He had backup.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.160
[Danny]
The fucking cripple?

24:57.760 --> 24:59.800
What happened to you, Uncle Terry?

24:59.880 --> 25:02.520
You used to be the meanest fucker
on the North Stand.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.160
I still am. So you have
a little bit of respect to your tone.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.920
Oh, you want respect, do you?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.320
Well, I want some fucking revenge.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.360
Easy, Croc, we'll find a way.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.200
Didn't the car dealer say
that the guy had a brother?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.720
So?

25:16.800 --> 25:19.240
So why don't we go after him instead?

25:24.480 --> 25:27.480
A brother for a brother.

25:27.560 --> 25:31.640
Yeah.
A brother for a brother.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.320
[feedback whines]

25:35.400 --> 25:37.240
[Jan]
Come on, Randi, you must play.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.600
[ukulele playing]

25:39.680 --> 25:42.000
[singing in Norwegian]

25:43.360 --> 25:44.640
Come on everybody, sing.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.360
[song ends]

26:00.440 --> 26:01.640
[Jan laughing]

26:01.720 --> 26:03.360
- [feedback whines]
- So on these trips of ours,

26:03.440 --> 26:06.760
which I hope will become a tradition,

26:06.840 --> 26:09.760
two things are in focus:

26:09.840 --> 26:12.600
exercise and integration.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.480
Or, as I like to call it, "exegration."

26:15.560 --> 26:17.520
[laughing]

26:17.600 --> 26:22.600
For this purpose, we've made
a small exegration pack for you.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.480
If you take two and two there.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.840
[woman] I'm not really very fond
of snow.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.880
Cheer up now.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.280
You don't want that young,
supple body of yours

26:34.360 --> 26:36.960
to drown in fat, do you?

26:37.040 --> 26:39.000
Jan.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.600
[clears throat]

26:40.680 --> 26:43.680
[singing in Norwegian]

26:43.760 --> 26:45.080
Randi.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.760
[Jan continues singing alone]

27:06.360 --> 27:08.680
Right, they stopped here
about an hour ago.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.520
And now they're going on
some sort of field trip to Gjendesheim

27:11.600 --> 27:12.840
and our guy is the driver.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.440
Good, right.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.560
- What's it called again?
- Gjendesheim.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.360
Gjendesheim.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.200
[GPS]  The destination Gjendesheim
does not exist.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.720
Gjendesheim.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.640
The destination Gjendesheim
does not exist.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.240
Oh, this is fucking shite.

27:28.320 --> 27:33.720
Destination Fogginshire,
set 1,240 miles southeast.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.200
[Terence]
Yeah, while you kids have been

27:35.280 --> 27:37.840
playing around
on your video machines,

27:37.920 --> 27:41.320
I found it old-school in a bleeding map.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.560
[Jan]
One, two three. One, two three.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.880
[singing in Norwegian]

28:11.440 --> 28:13.080
[speaking indistinctly]

28:19.760 --> 28:21.160
[singing stops]

28:36.440 --> 28:37.560
All right.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.880
Hello.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.160
Colorful bunch you've got here today.

28:43.240 --> 28:47.200
I can't quite fit you into this picture.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.880
What's your role in all of this?

28:48.960 --> 28:52.080
- He's the bus--
- No.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.520
I am a refugee.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.880
Oh, you poor thing.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.120
Where you from, mate?

29:00.200 --> 29:03.120
I'm, uh, from Poland.
Poland.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.520
Lots of wars in Poland these days, hmm?

29:07.120 --> 29:10.880
We have, uh, some conflicts.

29:12.840 --> 29:17.680
Excuse me,
I have to... just to go somewhere.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.880
[in English]
Watch this bull's-eye, Johnny.

29:26.960 --> 29:30.160
You're a cockeyed fuck.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.680
[in Norwegian] There's a smell here
seriously fucking with my concentration.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.520
This little lady's
up to her old tricks, huh?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.240
Any volunteers?

29:39.320 --> 29:42.080
I'll help you. [chuckles]

29:42.160 --> 29:43.320
[phone ringing]

29:43.400 --> 29:45.640
There we go, here we go.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.040
[in Norwegian] What's up, bro?

29:53.560 --> 29:55.200
[in English] Shit.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.000
- [in Norwegian] Come on.
- [engine starting]

30:09.080 --> 30:11.040
[in English] Yes. Okay.

30:13.640 --> 30:15.960
[chuckles]

30:16.040 --> 30:17.360
[toilet flushes]

30:17.440 --> 30:19.560
[Terence humming]

30:23.280 --> 30:25.520
Okay, sunshine.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.760
You've reached your final destination.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.520
Check the piece in the glove compartment.
You packing?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.480
All right.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.200
What do you need from me, boss?

30:37.280 --> 30:39.680
Eh... Get back in there

30:39.760 --> 30:41.840
and deal with this diaper situation.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.560
Okay, you got it, boss.

places with his brother.

decided to confess, has he?

34:17.440 --> 34:19.040
What changed his mind?

34:19.120 --> 34:21.920
Well, you of all people should
understand the brotherly bond.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.720
Yeah. All right.

34:24.800 --> 34:28.040
We'll let this big fat cunt go.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.560

You have a plan, I hope?

34:35.640 --> 34:37.400
[in English] I'm working on it.

we came from that direction.

No, bro,
that is exactly what I don't do.

talking about cock?
