<i>Sometimes
all it takes is a spark.</i>

00:12.071 --> 00:14.402
<i>Something very small.</i>

00:15.402 --> 00:17.702
<i>But the spark becomes a flame.</i>

00:17.704 --> 00:21.468
<i>And if that flame spreads, the
power can be so overwhelming</i>

00:21.470 --> 00:22.934
<i>it transforms everything
around it.</i>

00:24.437 --> 00:27.601
<i>We begin with breaking
news from Hope Springs, Arkansas.</i>

00:27.603 --> 00:30.400
<i>People are up in arms,
speaking out against what they believe...</i>

00:30.402 --> 00:32.868
<i>...only religious
leader who refused to abide the mandate.</i>

00:32.870 --> 00:34.934
David Hill, you're under arrest.
Contempt of court.

00:34.936 --> 00:37.001
You failed to produce your
sermons upon court order.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.734
<i>Please put your hands behind your back.</i>

00:39.736 --> 00:43.534
<i>The state is
overstepping its bounds.</i>

00:45.869 --> 00:48.400
<i>A subpoena of sermons
is needless and unprecedented.</i>

00:48.402 --> 00:51.268
<i>This is a witch hunt
to silence the victim.</i>

<i>We're seeing more
and more protests around the city</i>

01:05.003 --> 01:07.933
<i>since local pastor, David Hill, was
arrested for contempt of court.</i>

01:07.935 --> 01:11.800
<i>Hill refused to abide by a
controversial government mandate</i>

01:11.802 --> 01:14.933
<i>to turn over transcripts of his
sermons to city officials.</i>

01:14.935 --> 01:17.800
<i>And right now, a contentious
and heated free speech debate</i>

01:17.802 --> 01:22.100
<i>is threatening to boil over while the
pastor sits in jail waiting for a ruling.</i>

01:31.934 --> 01:33.535
Let's go.

01:47.334 --> 01:48.733
Appreciate it.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.932
- Hey.
- Jude.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.601
Ah.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.698
You wanna get
some waffles?

01:57.700 --> 02:00.531
Of course I wanna
get some waffles.

02:00.533 --> 02:03.664
Free Reverend Dave!
Free Reverend Dave!

02:03.666 --> 02:06.698
Free Reverend Dave!
Free Reverend Dave!

02:06.700 --> 02:08.931
<i>Reverend, what do you have
to say about being released today?</i>

02:08.933 --> 02:11.098
<i>I am grateful to the court
that they recognize</i>

02:11.100 --> 02:13.396
<i>that this mandate
was unconstitutional.</i>

02:13.398 --> 02:15.431
<i>I think this is more
of a human rights issue.</i>

02:15.433 --> 02:17.097
<i>It's about our right
to see truth</i>

02:17.099 --> 02:18.698
<i>and to share that truth
with others.</i>

02:18.700 --> 02:22.064
<i>But considering your church is
associated with a public university,</i>

02:22.066 --> 02:24.530
<i>how do you define
"truth" exactly?</i>

02:24.532 --> 02:26.565
<i>Truth is a person.</i>

02:28.066 --> 02:30.530
<i>The person of Jesus Christ.</i>

02:30.532 --> 02:33.330
<i>It's the one truth
above all others.</i>

02:33.332 --> 02:36.064
<i>What do you have to say to the people here
who are calling you an embarrassment?</i>

02:36.066 --> 02:38.797
<i>Jesus Christ is the one truth?
Really?</i>

02:38.799 --> 02:40.797
<i>This guy just can't
help himself, can he?</i>

02:40.799 --> 02:43.796
<i>This guy is a pastor who was
jailed for his beliefs.</i>

02:43.798 --> 02:46.529
<i>What if it was a Jewish rabbi
that said there was one truth?</i>

02:46.531 --> 02:49.097
- <i>Or a Muslim imam?</i>
- <i>They have that right. Freedom of worship.</i>

02:49.099 --> 02:52.395
<i>In places of worship. But
Hadleigh is a state university.</i>

02:52.397 --> 02:53.863
<i>See, and that's the question,
y'all.</i>

02:53.865 --> 02:56.530
<i>What's a church doing on a state
campus in the first place?</i>

02:56.532 --> 02:58.296
<i>We're seeing more and more
protests around the city.</i>

02:58.298 --> 03:02.063
<i>Students are actually calling for the removal
of Saint James from Hadleigh campus altogether.</i>

03:02.065 --> 03:04.462
<i>As the battle rages on
in Hope Springs...</i>

03:04.464 --> 03:06.795
<i>A historic landmark
that has served this community</i>

03:06.797 --> 03:07.996
<i>for over a century.</i>

03:07.998 --> 03:09.696
<i>And now they want
the church gone.</i>

03:09.698 --> 03:12.598
<i>This is what
our country has come to.</i>

03:29.663 --> 03:31.928
You gonna ask her out,
or what?

03:31.930 --> 03:33.962
Excuse me?

03:33.964 --> 03:36.528
We drive all the way
out here every week,

03:36.530 --> 03:38.394
drop off all this food.

03:38.396 --> 03:40.461
Why don't you finally
ask the girl out?

03:40.463 --> 03:42.328
She feeds homeless people,
Jude.

03:42.330 --> 03:43.660
That's why
we donate the food.

03:43.662 --> 03:45.794
Yes, but she obviously
likes you.

03:45.796 --> 03:47.527
No way.

03:47.529 --> 03:50.795
What's a six-letter word
for "clueless"?

03:50.797 --> 03:53.994
Funny. You're still
working on that thing?

03:53.996 --> 03:56.396
I'm much faster
when it's in Swahili.

03:57.330 --> 03:58.961
Fair enough.

04:00.863 --> 04:04.262
This tab's already been paid.
You guys enjoy.

04:05.729 --> 04:08.526
- Hey, convict.
- Hey.

04:08.528 --> 04:10.794
Just can't stay out of the
news these days, can you?

04:10.796 --> 04:14.927
Yeah, I've never had
so many people care what I think.

04:14.929 --> 04:17.459
Well, I'm on your side.
You know that.

04:17.462 --> 04:19.926
- Busy today, huh?
- Busy's good.

04:19.928 --> 04:21.659
More people to feed,
the better.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.426
Hey, thank your congregation
for all this.

04:23.428 --> 04:25.927
Couldn't do it without y'all.

04:25.929 --> 04:27.926
I'll see you next Saturday.

04:27.928 --> 04:29.561
Hold up.

04:31.394 --> 04:33.826
From last night.

04:33.828 --> 04:35.793
Pork chops
turned out great.

04:35.795 --> 04:37.394
Thanks.

04:51.061 --> 04:53.695
- Told you.
- Who asked you?

05:01.927 --> 05:05.793
We don't want you here!

05:12.392 --> 05:14.324
Wonder what my father
would think.

05:14.326 --> 05:17.724
When he was a pastor, he'd leave
these doors open day and night.

05:17.726 --> 05:19.391
Didn't matter.

05:19.393 --> 05:22.524
Now we hire armed security
guards to protect us

05:22.526 --> 05:24.791
from the same people we're
supposed to be ministering to.

05:24.793 --> 05:28.058
It's just fear, David,
and it can be overcome.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.791
You know this.

05:29.793 --> 05:32.390
- Do you ever complain?
- You know where I come from.

05:32.392 --> 05:34.924
I've seen my share
of struggles.

05:34.926 --> 05:37.557
But one thing
has never changed.

05:37.559 --> 05:40.923
God is good
all the time.

05:40.925 --> 05:44.259
And all the time,
God is good.

05:45.926 --> 05:49.791
<i>I appreciate you all braving
the angry mobs and picketers.</i>

05:49.793 --> 05:52.957
But even with all the noise
going on out there,

05:52.959 --> 05:57.823
I just want to assure you that Saint James
has been around for over 150 years,

05:57.825 --> 06:02.523
and despite what those picket signs say
out there, we're not going anywhere.

06:02.525 --> 06:06.456
- Amen!
- Now, looking forward, I have some very good news.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.792
Jude,
you want to come up?

06:12.457 --> 06:14.956
I couldn't be happier
to share

06:14.958 --> 06:17.523
that our very own
Jude Mbaye

06:17.525 --> 06:20.655
has accepted a permanent position
with us here at Saint James

06:20.657 --> 06:22.455
as my co-pastor.

06:22.457 --> 06:24.655
Amen. Welcome, brother.

06:24.657 --> 06:26.390
Thank you.

06:27.824 --> 06:31.454
You know, I realized tonight
that, uh, it's been a long time

06:31.456 --> 06:34.789
since I've felt like I had
a real brother in my life.

06:34.791 --> 06:38.689
David, are you
sharing your feelings?

06:38.691 --> 06:40.655
Okay, let's not make
a big deal out of it.

06:40.657 --> 06:44.056
I'm just saying
that I'm grateful for you.

06:44.058 --> 06:45.654
I'm excited.

06:45.656 --> 06:49.321
I feel the same. Now, can
we get some waffles?

06:51.389 --> 06:53.555
What was that?

06:53.557 --> 06:54.921
I don't know.

06:58.923 --> 07:01.554
- Hey! Hey! Get back here!
- David!

07:01.556 --> 07:03.389
David, no!

07:13.690 --> 07:16.954
- Ah.
- You call the police. I'll shut off the alarm.

07:16.956 --> 07:18.589
Yeah.

07:20.822 --> 07:24.653
Yeah, this is, uh, Reverend David Hill.
I'm a pastor at Saint James.

07:37.388 --> 07:38.786
Well, no,
it's not an emergency.

07:38.788 --> 07:42.654
It's just a... uh... It was a
broken window to the basement.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.821
Jude?

08:09.553 --> 08:10.821
Jude?

08:13.654 --> 08:16.521
Jude?

08:22.054 --> 08:24.653
Jude!

08:25.787 --> 08:28.518
- Oh, no.
- David.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.385
You're gonna be okay.
All right?

08:32.054 --> 08:34.650
- Stay with me.
- Okay.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.520
Come on.

08:55.419 --> 08:59.517
Jude, I'm gonna get you
out of here. Okay?

08:59.519 --> 09:00.519
- Okay.
- Stay with me.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.818
Please, God, help me.

09:19.685 --> 09:22.651
No, no.

09:32.785 --> 09:34.783
Dave.

09:34.785 --> 09:38.049
Don't talk, brother.
Don't talk. Just stay with me.

09:38.051 --> 09:41.682
Help is coming.
Hold on, Jude. It's okay.

09:44.684 --> 09:45.784
What?

09:49.851 --> 09:53.315
What are you saying? What does that mean?

09:53.317 --> 09:55.382
Jude?

09:56.051 --> 09:57.784
Jude.

09:58.983 --> 10:01.381
Jude?

10:01.383 --> 10:03.783
Please, God, no.
Jude! Help!

10:05.383 --> 10:07.516
Don't leave me, man.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.516
Jude.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.683
Jude, no.

10:57.548 --> 10:59.582
<i>I'm so tired of all the noise.</i>

11:01.781 --> 11:03.645
<i>Everyone yelling.</i>

11:03.647 --> 11:06.647
<i>On the news.
In the classroom.</i>

11:08.082 --> 11:09.847
<i>Even in church.</i>

11:11.948 --> 11:14.247
<i>I can barely hear you anymore.</i>

11:20.848 --> 11:22.781
<i>Are you even there?</i>

11:26.713 --> 11:28.280
<i>I hope you are.</i>

11:31.546 --> 11:33.681
<i>'Cause I feel so lost, God.</i>

11:35.547 --> 11:37.911
I'm starting to feel pretty dumb
talking to myself

11:37.913 --> 11:39.713
when you don't talk back,
so...

11:42.047 --> 11:44.246
wherever you are...

11:45.713 --> 11:47.646
I'm still here.

11:48.913 --> 11:51.045
Hey.

11:51.047 --> 11:52.711
Hi.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.778
I stopped at Stella's,
got you the good stuff.

11:54.780 --> 11:57.910
- My hero. Thank you.
- I know. You're welcome.

11:57.912 --> 11:59.678
- How was your day?
- Good.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.512
Wow, this looks, uh, fun.

12:06.812 --> 12:08.579
You can get it
if you want.

12:09.645 --> 12:12.044
- It's Sunday.
- Oh, that's right.

12:12.046 --> 12:14.376
You're...
"in church."

12:14.378 --> 12:16.910
- Don't be a jerk.
- Why don't you just tell 'em?

12:16.912 --> 12:21.043
Adam, my parents would be devastated if
they found out I was even questioning.

12:21.045 --> 12:24.044
- Okay, you have no idea.
- Yeah, I do.

12:24.046 --> 12:26.376
I did my time as a kid,
remember?

12:26.378 --> 12:28.844
I just got out
sooner than you did.

12:28.846 --> 12:30.511
Okay, can we not
talk about this?

12:32.511 --> 12:33.679
Sure.

12:36.978 --> 12:38.678
I get it.

12:40.045 --> 12:42.043
What you're
going through.

12:42.045 --> 12:43.711
I really do.

12:46.777 --> 12:49.043
Okay, go to your study group.
I have work to do.

12:49.045 --> 12:51.244
- Are you kicking me out?
- Mm-hmm.

12:52.078 --> 12:54.308
Fine. See you later.

12:54.310 --> 12:56.644
Okay. Bye.
Thanks for the snack.

13:10.711 --> 13:13.975
<i>Okay, wait, wait. So, let me get this straight.</i>

13:13.977 --> 13:18.441
So, you're saying that because the
Kit Kat logo doesn't have a hyphen,

13:18.443 --> 13:20.374
it proves there are
multiple realities?

13:20.376 --> 13:22.641
Hey, look, you're oversimplifying,
but, yes, exactly.

13:22.643 --> 13:24.674
How am I oversimplifying?
That's exactly what you said.

13:24.676 --> 13:26.908
Yeah, but it's not just Kit Kat though.
It's a lot of things.

13:26.910 --> 13:29.507
- Like what?
- Like Curious George used to have a tail.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.307
- But now he doesn't.
- What?

13:31.309 --> 13:32.608
- "Used to"?
- Yeah.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.707
- No, it didn't change. People just remember it wrong.
- Look it up.

13:35.709 --> 13:38.374
Okay, but maybe it did change.
Maybe it did change.

13:38.376 --> 13:40.640
Curious George
does not have a tail?

13:40.642 --> 13:41.409
- No.
- On it.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.774
My whole life's a lie.

13:44.776 --> 13:47.041
- This is freaking me out.
- You haven't heard about this?

13:47.043 --> 13:49.907
- No!
- No, it's called the Mandela Effect.

13:49.909 --> 13:53.041
Millions of people thought that Nelson
Mandela died in prison in the '80s,

13:53.043 --> 13:54.239
but he didn't.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.774
The theory is our reality
collided with a parallel reality.

13:56.776 --> 14:00.773
Right, where Kit Kat has no hyphen
and Curious George has no tail.

14:00.775 --> 14:01.940
- That's right.
- Okay.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.639
Look, it's science, yo, okay?
Quantum physics. Look it up.

14:05.641 --> 14:07.207
Do you guys seriously not hear
how ridiculous you sound?

14:07.209 --> 14:10.773
Okay, but God had himself a human son who
could walk on water and multiply fish,

14:10.775 --> 14:11.940
and that's not ridiculous?

14:11.942 --> 14:15.439
So, yeah, given the choice,
I'm taking the Kit Kat theory.

14:15.441 --> 14:17.773
And if we get lucky, maybe
we'll collide with a reality

14:17.775 --> 14:21.039
where our school isn't poisoned by
Reverend Dave and his one truth.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.506
- Ooh.
- Preach it.

14:22.508 --> 14:24.638
You just don't get it
'cause you're one of 'em, K.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.405
Not really.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.073
I mean, not anymore.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.507
Excuse me?

14:30.708 --> 14:35.506
- What?
- Okay, if you're not one of them, then what are you?

14:35.508 --> 14:37.039
What am I?

14:37.041 --> 14:40.240
I'm annoyed by you
because you're annoying.

14:40.774 --> 14:42.640
I have to go.

14:45.407 --> 14:47.371
- Sorry, bro.
- Thanks, Teo.

14:47.373 --> 14:50.305
- It was a conversation.
- It's okay.

14:51.841 --> 14:53.705
Keaton, wait up.

14:53.707 --> 14:56.538
- Look, I didn't mean anything by it.
- I know. It's fine.

14:56.540 --> 14:59.573
- I have a chem test tomorrow. I have to study.
- We were just joking.

15:00.773 --> 15:02.404
Keaton.

15:02.406 --> 15:04.504
I don't care what you
believe and don't believe,

15:04.506 --> 15:06.304
and I don't have
a problem with God.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.839
Yeah, but you do, Adam.
Okay?

15:07.841 --> 15:10.639
You say it's just the church or
religion or whatever, but...

15:12.306 --> 15:13.771
You know what?

15:13.773 --> 15:16.971
I'm so tired of having this same
conversation over and over again with you.

15:16.973 --> 15:18.573
Yeah, me too.

15:21.639 --> 15:23.506
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:25.906 --> 15:27.638
Okay?

15:28.906 --> 15:31.405
- I know.
- Okay.

15:38.572 --> 15:40.505
I think I...

15:41.538 --> 15:44.238
I think I just need
some time right now.

15:47.305 --> 15:49.370
On my own.

15:50.039 --> 15:51.903
What does that mean?

15:51.905 --> 15:54.237
Just to figure things out.

15:56.771 --> 15:58.769
Are you serious?

15:58.771 --> 16:01.969
No, come on. Don't...

16:01.971 --> 16:04.569
Don't do that.

16:04.571 --> 16:07.504
Keaton, please. What are you doing?
Come on.

16:08.504 --> 16:10.504
I love you.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.802
I know.

16:13.804 --> 16:15.771
I love you.
Don't do this.

16:16.904 --> 16:18.504
I'm sorry.

16:26.503 --> 16:29.570
All the time, God is good.

Dear God, thank you for Harbor House.
Lord, we're broken people.

17:05.569 --> 17:08.500
Please just bring healing and
restoration to our school right now,

17:08.502 --> 17:09.934
um, in this really
difficult time.

17:09.935 --> 17:13.299
We love you and answer to
your beautiful name. Amen.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.967
- Amen.
- Thanks, guys. Have a good one.

17:23.534 --> 17:26.967
- Hey.
- I know, I know. I've been MIA.

17:26.969 --> 17:28.900
It's just been
a really crazy semester.

17:28.902 --> 17:30.833
Yeah, no,
I totally get it.

17:30.835 --> 17:33.500
Well, look, you're more than
welcome to come down to the city

17:33.502 --> 17:35.899
and work on our habitat
project, if you want.

17:35.901 --> 17:37.701
Cool. Yeah.
I'll definitely try.

17:40.501 --> 17:42.568
Did you know that there's
no hyphen in "Kit Kat"?

17:44.367 --> 17:46.765
You mean like Kit Kat,
the candy bar?

17:46.767 --> 17:50.298
Yeah. You know what?
Sorry. Forget it.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.431
I'm being really weird.

17:52.433 --> 17:56.765
Hey, if you need to talk
about anything or whatever,

17:56.767 --> 17:58.565
I'm always here.

17:58.567 --> 18:01.500
Thanks, but I'm fine, really.
See ya.

18:41.898 --> 18:46.363
See, this here is why you should
never talk religion or politics, yo.

18:46.365 --> 18:48.364
Dude, that's all
you talk about.

18:49.498 --> 18:51.630
Will you have Keaton text me
when you get back?

18:51.632 --> 18:52.630
Oh, uh-uh.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.030
Leave me out of this.
This one is on you, Adam.

18:56.032 --> 18:59.232
If she wants to text you,
she will text you.

19:01.565 --> 19:03.896
All right, look, you need
to sleep it off, man.

19:03.898 --> 19:05.396
All right?

19:05.398 --> 19:07.429
- I'm fine.
- Are you good?

19:07.431 --> 19:08.396
Yeah.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.264
All right, man. We're going this way.
Later.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.364
Yeah, right.

20:08.930 --> 20:11.359
Hey!

20:11.361 --> 20:15.293
- Hey! Get back here!
- David! David, no!

20:23.762 --> 20:26.359
<i>The city
was in shock late last night</i>

20:26.361 --> 20:28.393
<i>when a tragic fire
broke out at Saint James.</i>

20:28.395 --> 20:30.526
<i>That is the controversial church
on the campus</i>

20:30.528 --> 20:32.626
<i>of our very own
Hadleigh University.</i>

20:32.628 --> 20:36.359
<i>Both police and fire departments
have not ruled out arson</i>

20:36.361 --> 20:40.892
<i>in the fire that has claimed the life of a
visiting pastor from Ghana, Jude Mbaye.</i>

20:40.894 --> 20:45.792
<i>Police and the FBI are now treating
the case as a hate-crime homicide.</i>

20:45.794 --> 20:49.960
<i>Crowds have already started to gather
outside the church to pay their respects.</i>

20:49.962 --> 20:52.959
This is why a church does
not belong on a state campus.

20:52.961 --> 20:57.026
Favoring one religion over another?
Of course people are angry.

20:57.028 --> 20:59.492
It just invites violence
like this.

20:59.494 --> 21:02.360
What else is it gonna take
for people to wake up?

21:05.028 --> 21:08.558
The church has brought nothing but
controversy to the school for years.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.026
- It's time.
- Our enrollment is down 18 percent.

21:12.028 --> 21:15.025
We stand to lose
$15 million this year alone.

21:15.027 --> 21:19.292
I'm well aware of that, but we can't
pin all of this on Saint James.

21:19.294 --> 21:24.357
Well, this university is in the midst of an
identity crisis, Tom, because of Saint James.

21:24.359 --> 21:26.891
- We're moving backwards.
- This is wrong.

21:26.893 --> 21:29.357
The church
is a historic landmark.

21:29.359 --> 21:31.758
It was here
before the university.

21:31.760 --> 21:36.025
Dave...
is a good man.

21:36.027 --> 21:39.291
What about Jude,
the one who died?

21:39.293 --> 21:41.491
I'm sure he was
a good man too.

21:41.493 --> 21:44.657
Barbara,
with all due respect,

21:44.659 --> 21:48.356
if we kick the church off campus
now after what just happened,

21:48.358 --> 21:49.758
how do you think
that's gonna look?

21:49.760 --> 21:52.624
We're gonna look bad
no matter what we do.

21:52.626 --> 21:56.359
But in the long run, this is
what's best for the students.

21:57.759 --> 21:59.358
Okay.

22:00.759 --> 22:04.625
Tom, I think you should be the
one to talk to Reverend Dave.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.790
Dave is my friend.

22:07.792 --> 22:10.357
Exactly.

We love you.

23:01.356 --> 23:03.621
We're grieving
right alongside you.

23:03.623 --> 23:06.789
Consider us your home
for as long as you need.

23:08.389 --> 23:12.822
<i>Our second message
in this difficult hour,</i>

23:12.824 --> 23:17.821
the same one that Peter, John, and
James spoke on that one dark night

23:17.823 --> 23:21.656
when all their hopes died
on that bloodstained cross.

23:22.622 --> 23:25.487
Weeping may last
through the night,

23:25.489 --> 23:28.887
but joy cometh

23:58.055 --> 24:00.419
I'm sorry.

24:00.421 --> 24:03.885
- I never know what to say at these things.
- No, it's okay.

24:03.887 --> 24:08.886
I'll come by, and we can discuss the details,
construction plans, repairs, all that.

24:08.888 --> 24:13.351
Yeah.
Well... when you're ready.

24:13.353 --> 24:16.885
Okay? Don't rush.
Just come on by my office.

24:16.887 --> 24:18.485
- Thanks, Tom.
- Yeah. Hang in there.

24:18.487 --> 24:20.221
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

24:25.487 --> 24:28.052
Jude spoke of you
all the time.

24:28.054 --> 24:30.652
His American brother.

24:30.654 --> 24:33.754
I thank God he wasn't alone
in his last moments.

24:35.352 --> 24:38.353
- I'm sorry.
- This is not your fault.

24:39.619 --> 24:44.653
God, he uses all things
for his good.

24:45.753 --> 24:47.619
You know this.

24:56.653 --> 24:58.884
What does...?

24:58.886 --> 25:01.517
I think that's what
Jude said to me.

25:01.519 --> 25:04.518
Last thing he said to me.
What does that mean?

25:05.752 --> 25:08.416
It's hard
to translate.

25:08.418 --> 25:12.017
In English,
it means, basically,

25:12.019 --> 25:15.950
"Always God is good,

25:15.952 --> 25:19.351
and God is good always."

26:04.884 --> 26:06.481
Hey.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.616
Dave, what are you
doing here?

26:10.617 --> 26:12.347
Well, it's Saturday,
isn't it?

26:12.349 --> 26:14.381
I mean, people
still need to eat.

26:14.383 --> 26:16.382
Sorry, it's a little bit
light this week,

26:16.384 --> 26:19.048
but, uh, well, everything in
the pantry was ruined, so...

26:19.050 --> 26:21.015
I know. I heard.
I'm so sorry.

26:21.017 --> 26:24.616
And Jude.
Ah, I can't believe it.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.748
Thanks.
I'll be okay.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.683
You hungry? How about I
feed you for a change?

26:32.783 --> 26:35.616
Thanks,
but, uh, rain check?

26:36.882 --> 26:39.349
Okay. You know
where to find me.

26:52.016 --> 26:54.947
- Hey.
- Dave.

26:54.949 --> 26:57.880
Thanks for coming in.

26:57.882 --> 27:00.013
Let's go get
a cup of coffee.

27:00.015 --> 27:01.879
Sure.

27:01.881 --> 27:05.047
Tom, this is insane.

27:05.049 --> 27:09.379
You're gonna use this as an opportunity
to advance some political agenda?

27:09.381 --> 27:11.013
It's not about that.

27:11.015 --> 27:14.612
You don't just knock a church down
because of a little controversy.

27:14.614 --> 27:16.612
Look, the insurance
will cover the damage.

27:16.614 --> 27:18.646
It won't cost
the university anything.

27:18.648 --> 27:22.345
It's not about the money either.
It's really not.

27:22.347 --> 27:25.812
This makes no sense.
We were attacked.

27:25.814 --> 27:27.879
I know.

27:27.881 --> 27:32.478
But, Dave, we're worried about the
school, the welfare of the students.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.548
There are a lot
of factors here.

27:36.047 --> 27:37.878
Look, I know you're upset.

27:37.880 --> 27:41.745
You have every right to be.
I don't like this either.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.246
I hope you get that.

27:46.346 --> 27:48.346
It's all in there.

27:54.513 --> 27:56.613
This was my father's church.

27:58.879 --> 28:01.411
I was baptized there.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.045
I spent
my whole life there.

28:03.047 --> 28:04.878
I know.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.377
It's my home, Tom.

28:06.379 --> 28:09.345
It's everything I have.

28:10.046 --> 28:12.044
And it's not for sale.

28:12.046 --> 28:14.777
I don't think
you're hearing me, Dave.

28:14.779 --> 28:16.746
The board has decided.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.479
It's a done deal.

28:22.612 --> 28:24.245
I'm sorry.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.543
This is absurd. They can just
take the church from us?

28:28.545 --> 28:30.342
- I mean, don't we own this land?
- Yes.

28:30.344 --> 28:32.644
- So, how is this legal?
- Eminent domain.

28:32.646 --> 28:35.477
I studied property law
a bit in grad school.

28:35.479 --> 28:37.943
As I understand it, the state
gave all public universities

28:37.945 --> 28:40.609
complete autonomy
over eminent domain.

28:40.611 --> 28:42.876
Which means Hadleigh can
legally force us to sell.

28:42.878 --> 28:44.476
Where are we
supposed to go?

28:44.478 --> 28:47.810
With what they're offering, how can we
build anything anyway? Can we go to court?

28:47.812 --> 28:49.876
Another lawsuit? Really?

28:49.878 --> 28:53.275
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but
we've burned through any legal reserves.

28:53.277 --> 28:54.910
No land within 30 miles
of here.

28:54.912 --> 28:56.643
We're out of money,
plain and simple.

28:56.645 --> 28:59.777
- None that we can afford.
- I don't see that we have an option here.

29:05.012 --> 29:07.477
You gonna be okay?

29:11.545 --> 29:16.608
All these years,
this church has been here.

29:16.610 --> 29:19.343
When I think about the work
that God has done...

29:20.876 --> 29:22.776
and the lives
that he's changed...

29:24.510 --> 29:27.210
Now it's just
a crime scene.

29:34.610 --> 29:36.676
You know, Keaton stopped by
the other day.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.543
Remember her?

29:40.643 --> 29:43.274
First time I've seen her
in five months.

29:43.276 --> 29:45.674
She's lost.

29:45.676 --> 29:48.673
She needs someone to walk with
her right where she's at.

29:48.675 --> 29:51.473
There are hundreds more
like her, here.

29:51.475 --> 29:52.808
I know, Josh.
I got it, but...

29:52.810 --> 29:55.874
This is why I took on Professor
Radisson, why I left law school...

29:55.876 --> 29:57.740
for this ministry.

29:57.742 --> 30:02.473
Because what we do and how we
do it, it's important, Dave.

30:02.475 --> 30:04.941
Josh, we have no money,
no lawyers.

30:04.943 --> 30:06.874
If I could do something,
I would.

30:06.876 --> 30:09.740
It's just...
It's not that easy.

30:09.742 --> 30:11.341
No, it's not easy.

30:12.942 --> 30:14.542
But it's simple.

30:17.341 --> 30:20.039
Look, I, uh...

30:20.041 --> 30:22.608
I hate to quote scripture
to a pastor, but, um...

30:24.341 --> 30:25.474
you remember
Luke 12:48?

30:28.641 --> 30:31.340
Seems like you're the one much
is being asked of this time.

30:34.475 --> 30:36.641
If you decide you want
to fight this...

30:38.741 --> 30:41.340
pretty sure God'll
handle the details.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.641
And I'll be right here
beside you.

31:43.372 --> 31:46.804
You got an apartment?
Okay, Apartment "E"?

31:46.806 --> 31:48.870
Thank you.

31:48.872 --> 31:51.870
- Okay, don't you worry about it.
- Thank you, Pearce.

31:51.872 --> 31:53.470
I swear Mike's
a good kid.

31:53.472 --> 31:55.603
He's just really struggling
right now, with his friends.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.605
- He's just caught up...
- What are you doing here?

32:04.872 --> 32:07.536
Dad's church.

32:07.538 --> 32:10.003
You'd hardly
even recognize it.

32:10.005 --> 32:14.469
Hey, look, this is a property law case.
It's not really my thing.

32:14.471 --> 32:16.636
Pearce, you're
a social justice attorney.

32:16.638 --> 32:20.337
They're forcing us out because we're a
church. This is exactly your thing.

32:22.337 --> 32:24.036
Let me get this straight.

32:24.038 --> 32:26.869
You drive all the way up here.
You don't even call.

32:26.871 --> 32:28.736
Were you afraid I'd say no?

32:28.738 --> 32:30.868
I didn't know what you'd
say, to be honest.

32:30.870 --> 32:33.268
Look,
I have a little money.

32:33.270 --> 32:35.802
I don't want your money.

32:35.804 --> 32:37.301
This is a legit offer.

32:37.303 --> 32:41.468
Thing goes to trial, jury will probably
give you half that amount, less even.

32:41.470 --> 32:45.203
Money aside, these things
always get messy.

32:46.636 --> 32:50.002
God called me to fight,
and I'm gonna fight.

32:50.004 --> 32:52.737
Ah. God calls you,
you call me.

32:55.403 --> 32:57.334
- Did you see that?
- Right in third position.

32:57.336 --> 32:58.901
Uh-huh. Third position?

32:58.903 --> 33:00.901
Mm-hmm.

33:00.903 --> 33:02.636
Adam, what's up, baby?
Where you been?

33:06.335 --> 33:08.335
Can I talk to you?

33:23.735 --> 33:25.468
What do I do?

33:27.501 --> 33:29.866
What do I do?

33:29.868 --> 33:32.334
I don't know what to do.

33:40.868 --> 33:44.466
I appreciate you coming down. I know
you're busy. It's a lot to ask.

33:44.468 --> 33:45.767
Sure.

33:53.001 --> 33:55.535
Wow. Look at this place.
It got smaller.

33:59.534 --> 34:01.865
What'd you do
to the tree?

34:01.867 --> 34:04.600
Huh?
What's wrong with it?

34:06.001 --> 34:08.233
For one thing,
it's dead.

34:10.634 --> 34:13.665
I figured you could take
your old room.

34:13.667 --> 34:16.734
It's kind of a guest room
and some storage, but...

34:19.400 --> 34:20.898
Wow.

34:20.900 --> 34:23.731
Got the old man's chair.

34:23.733 --> 34:25.599
Allowed to sit in it now?

34:35.933 --> 34:38.264
Sorry to hear
about your friend.

34:38.266 --> 34:40.666
Yeah. Thanks.

34:41.666 --> 34:43.732
But I'm okay.

34:45.331 --> 34:47.998
You know, that's... what
you said at Mom's funeral.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.731
"I'm okay."

34:49.733 --> 34:53.731
Somebody burns your church
down, kills your friend,

34:53.733 --> 34:54.996
but you're okay.

34:54.998 --> 34:56.897
What do you want me
to say, Pearce?

34:56.899 --> 34:59.329
Yes, I'm having
a hard time.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.198
Just doing my best
to get through.

35:02.365 --> 35:03.630
You want something
to drink?

35:03.632 --> 35:06.532
- You got booze?
- No.

35:15.465 --> 35:17.896
Did you buy three boxes
of these for me?

35:17.898 --> 35:20.729
Of course.
I knew you'd come.

35:20.731 --> 35:23.762
Unfortunately, I don't
really eat Zingers anymore.

35:23.764 --> 35:26.495
What do you mean you don't eat Zingers?
You love those things.

35:26.497 --> 35:28.862
- What happened?
- Triple bypass.

35:28.864 --> 35:30.896
Heart surgery?

35:30.898 --> 35:33.595
- You had heart surgery?
- Six years ago.

35:33.597 --> 35:35.327
I had no idea.

35:35.329 --> 35:37.196
Why would you?

35:38.731 --> 35:42.595
Well, we're all caught up.
And I'm gonna hit the hay.

35:42.597 --> 35:44.330
Night.

35:45.463 --> 35:46.730
Night.

35:59.863 --> 36:05.327
Eminent domain precedent cases having to do
with churches specifically would be best.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.494
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

36:07.496 --> 36:09.728
Well, just take the meeting
without me, Todd.

36:09.730 --> 36:14.494
No, I realize that, but it's a family
thing. What do you want me to say?

36:14.496 --> 36:18.461
Just make sure everything has the same zip.
Okay? Okay, thanks.

36:18.463 --> 36:21.660
- Make yourself at home.
- You doing all right?

36:21.662 --> 36:24.627
I'll tell you what. You stop asking
me, and I'll stop saying I'm okay.

36:24.629 --> 36:26.595
Fair enough.

36:27.862 --> 36:29.727
Ready to get to it?

36:29.729 --> 36:32.326
I've been getting to it
since 5:00 a.m.

36:32.328 --> 36:36.493
Okay? I'm starving. There's nothing
in that fridge but moldy casseroles.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.493
- Is Doe's still open?
- I guess.

36:38.495 --> 36:41.195
Well, let's go.
Don't eat that!

36:43.861 --> 36:45.860
The government
takes private property.

36:45.862 --> 36:47.592
They do it all the time.
End of story.

36:47.594 --> 36:50.459
How do you think highways and
railroads get built, man?

36:50.461 --> 36:54.859
But this isn't about a railroad. They said they
need the land to build a new student union.

36:54.861 --> 36:57.993
- I hardly think that qualifies.
- We'll see. It might.

36:57.995 --> 36:59.559
You're not hearing me.

36:59.561 --> 37:03.993
They just want the church gone because
they think it's bad PR for the university.

37:03.995 --> 37:05.725
- Yeah, they're probably right.
- Pearce.

37:05.727 --> 37:09.726
Hey, listen, man.
I said this ain't my thing.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.926
All right? Now you want to tell me
how to fight an eminent domain case?

37:12.928 --> 37:15.461
Why don't I just go home?
You can do it.

37:27.927 --> 37:30.193
This is eerie.

37:33.325 --> 37:34.925
Let's go check it out.

37:34.927 --> 37:37.493
We can't.
It's all locked up.

37:58.993 --> 38:02.759
Last time I was in this building,
Dad was standing right there.

38:23.525 --> 38:24.491
Hey.

38:26.591 --> 38:28.923
You got in so
much trouble for that.

38:30.858 --> 38:32.758
So stupid.

38:36.658 --> 38:39.456
I'm gonna write a letter
to the board of trustees

38:39.458 --> 38:41.855
and introduce myself
as your legal counsel.

38:41.857 --> 38:44.757
I'll politely let them know we
won't be entertaining any more...

38:45.892 --> 38:48.725
backroom offers
between old friends.

38:52.724 --> 38:54.323
Thank you.

38:55.590 --> 38:57.624
One step at a time,
little brother.

39:00.624 --> 39:03.355
His brother is a lawyer?
Are you kidding me?

39:03.357 --> 39:06.587
Of course he's gonna fight back.
What'd you expect?

39:06.589 --> 39:09.855
At least we can offer him
a better settlement.

39:09.857 --> 39:11.454
Something more fair.

39:11.456 --> 39:13.254
And where do we take
that money from?

39:13.256 --> 39:16.587
To pay any more than legally required
is a disservice to the school,

39:16.589 --> 39:18.723
not to mention,
it's unethical.

39:20.723 --> 39:23.988
Be careful not to let your friendship
with Reverend Dave cloud your judgment.

39:23.990 --> 39:26.854
Look, I'm on your side.

39:26.856 --> 39:30.387
My advice is take care
of this now,

39:30.389 --> 39:32.723
or the person
who replaces you will.

39:36.989 --> 39:40.320
<i>It's important to remember, in
the midst of all this controversy,</i>

39:40.322 --> 39:44.319
<i>that friends and family are now
grieving the death of this innocent man</i>

39:44.321 --> 39:47.586
<i>killed in this tragic
and senseless way.</i>

39:47.588 --> 39:50.486
<i>I can't even imagine the heartbreak
for his parents, having to...</i>

40:06.022 --> 40:08.585
Maybe you just need to
stop thinking about it.

40:08.587 --> 40:10.187
I can't.

40:11.454 --> 40:12.722
How can I?

40:14.354 --> 40:16.587
Everybody thinks...

40:17.854 --> 40:21.354
that he was... murdered.

40:22.988 --> 40:26.718
His-His friends,
his parents.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.719
They deserve to know the truth...
that it was an accident.

40:30.721 --> 40:33.585
Maybe it'll help them.

40:33.587 --> 40:36.452
Maybe that'll give them
some sort of closure.

40:36.454 --> 40:39.187
Okay, so say you confess.

40:40.887 --> 40:44.718
Maybe they'll go easy on you, but...
maybe they won't.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.620
Okay, and then what?

40:48.653 --> 40:50.319
I don't know.

40:55.720 --> 41:00.186
Do you really believe...
that there's a God?

41:06.652 --> 41:09.218
I don't know. I guess.

41:12.786 --> 41:15.453
If he does exist...

41:17.986 --> 41:20.452
do you think that he
would forgive me?

41:24.019 --> 41:25.652
Of course.

41:47.351 --> 41:50.716
Hey, Pearce. I'm headed to church.
You want to join?

41:50.718 --> 41:52.518
Not one bit.

41:56.351 --> 41:57.883
Look what I found.

41:57.885 --> 41:59.518
What?

42:00.618 --> 42:01.982
Check it out.

42:01.984 --> 42:03.615
My gosh.

42:03.617 --> 42:05.983
Wait, wait, wait. I want
to show you something.

42:05.985 --> 42:07.617
Man.

42:16.717 --> 42:19.581
Stretchy!

42:19.583 --> 42:21.981
Wow.

42:21.983 --> 42:25.248
I thought most of this stuff
would've ended up in a landfill.

42:25.250 --> 42:27.316
- No.
- Hey.

42:28.516 --> 42:31.247
Pearce, Aunt Celia
painted that.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.380
Who cares? It's ugly.

42:33.382 --> 42:35.581
- Bet you can't hit the frog.
- Grow up.

42:35.583 --> 42:37.182
Ten bucks.

42:37.849 --> 42:39.482
Give it to me.

42:44.482 --> 42:45.749
Told you.

42:49.716 --> 42:53.314
Wow. Mandy Stebbins.

42:54.314 --> 42:55.847
Whatever happened to her?

42:55.849 --> 42:57.980
I don't know. If she's not
on Facebook, I have no idea.

42:57.982 --> 42:59.980
Hey.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.448
Confirmation.

43:06.615 --> 43:08.346
You still pray for me?

43:08.348 --> 43:09.980
Pearce, can we not?

43:09.982 --> 43:13.013
Why? I'm just curious.

43:13.015 --> 43:15.479
Yeah. Sometimes.

43:15.481 --> 43:18.013
I knew it.
What do you pray for?

43:18.015 --> 43:20.579
I'll come back around?
I'll find peace? What?

43:20.581 --> 43:22.980
- Is this fun for you?
- I'm just making conversation.

43:22.982 --> 43:25.745
Yeah, well, maybe I'll pray that
you make better conversation.

43:25.747 --> 43:29.181
Josh?

43:29.782 --> 43:32.180
What? Right now?

43:34.715 --> 43:37.645
Hey, I'm gonna need the
name of a circuit judge down here.

43:37.647 --> 43:39.845
Yes. Now. Today.

43:39.847 --> 43:41.478
- Okay, let me know.
- Dave!

43:41.480 --> 43:43.845
Yeah. What... What's going on?
They won't stop.

43:43.847 --> 43:48.311
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop!

43:48.313 --> 43:50.477
I need you on the other
side of the tape, sir.

43:50.479 --> 43:53.445
- I'm the pastor of this church.
- Well, that may be, but it's not safe.

43:53.447 --> 43:55.512
- It's okay. I'm his attorney.
- Congratulations.

43:55.514 --> 43:58.778
And I'm a Mets fan. Now, move
back, or I call the cops.

43:58.780 --> 44:02.311
- I already called 'em.
- Hey, buddy, I have a demo permit.

44:02.313 --> 44:04.711
- You got a permit to wreck a church on a Sunday? Really?
- Yeah, what can I say?

44:04.713 --> 44:06.444
Signed by the president
of the university.

44:06.446 --> 44:09.444
Thomas Ellsworth.
Unbelievable.

44:09.446 --> 44:13.011
- Just trying to do my job here.
- And I'm trying to do mine. Give me your keys.

44:13.013 --> 44:14.711
You touch this church
before I get back,

44:14.713 --> 44:16.744
I'll have you arrested for
destruction of property, okay?

44:16.746 --> 44:19.577
- You stay put.
- Yeah, what do you want me to do?

44:19.579 --> 44:21.513
I don't know. Stall.

44:23.246 --> 44:25.645
- You have a Bible?
- Yeah.

44:27.746 --> 44:30.713
Yeah, yeah, Gloria Pascual.
I know. I'm already on my way.

44:32.345 --> 44:34.843
What? Are you kidding me?

44:34.845 --> 44:36.513
Ah.

44:37.712 --> 44:40.010
Of course she is.
It's Sunday. Where is she?

44:40.012 --> 44:43.343
Yeah, yeah, I know it.
I know the place.

44:43.345 --> 44:46.709
Hey, everyone.
We're gonna hold service.

44:46.711 --> 44:48.309
Right now.

44:48.311 --> 44:50.977
Come on in, guys.
Come on. Come on over here.

44:50.979 --> 44:53.578
- Can I have that Bible?
- Yeah.

44:55.345 --> 45:00.575
So the, uh... the Bible
is the word of God.

45:00.577 --> 45:03.609
But how often do we really
take time to read it?

45:03.611 --> 45:05.477
Let's start at the top,
shall we?

45:06.444 --> 45:07.976
- "In the beginning..."
- Man.

45:07.978 --> 45:10.308
They haven't even filed yet.

45:10.310 --> 45:12.442
No appraisals,
no escrow deposits.

45:12.444 --> 45:15.577
It's an old-fashioned
end-around. Hold on.

45:18.577 --> 45:21.308
You still there? You still
gotta send me the injunction.

45:21.310 --> 45:24.708
Yeah, pdf's fine.
Okay, hurry up.

45:24.710 --> 45:28.009
Hey, hey, hey! I don't even
know what she looks like.

45:28.011 --> 45:30.575
The judge. Who do you
think I'm talking about?

45:30.577 --> 45:32.441
Yeah, send me a pic.

45:58.376 --> 46:01.573
"The serpent was more crafty
than any other wild animals

46:01.575 --> 46:03.340
the Lord God had made.

46:03.342 --> 46:04.975
And he said to the woman,

46:04.977 --> 46:08.306
'Did God really say you must not
eat from the tree in any garden?'"

46:17.976 --> 46:20.473
Your Honor,
I am so sorry,

46:20.475 --> 46:23.739
but I'm an attorney, and it's
important that I speak with you.

46:23.741 --> 46:26.572
I'm in the middle
of Mass.

46:26.574 --> 46:30.774
I'm aware. It's very timely.
It involves a church.

46:30.776 --> 46:34.573
<i>And we want to take you live
to the scene right now,</i>

46:34.575 --> 46:36.472
<i>show you what is
developing as we speak.</i>

46:36.474 --> 46:38.305
<i>You are looking here
at Saint James Church.</i>

46:38.307 --> 46:40.706
<i>This is on the campus
of Hadleigh University now.</i>

46:40.708 --> 46:43.706
<i>Local pastor, David Hill,
is basically staging</i>

46:43.708 --> 46:48.773
<i>his very own version of what can only be
described here as a Senate filibuster.</i>

46:48.775 --> 46:51.839
<i>His last-ditch effort to delay
the demolition of his church.</i>

46:51.841 --> 46:56.372
<i>As you can see here, he's literally
reading the Bible cover to cover</i>

46:56.374 --> 46:58.905
<i>while the growing crowds
watch and wait.</i>

46:58.907 --> 47:00.872
Yeah, that's him.

47:00.874 --> 47:03.738
Your little stunt's gonna cost you
and the pastor a night in jail.

47:03.740 --> 47:04.906
Well, I don't think so.

47:04.908 --> 47:08.872
I have a signed injunction from
Judge Pascual that says...

47:08.874 --> 47:12.573
Well, you can read it yourself.
"Cease and desist."

47:15.774 --> 47:17.971
Good? Thank you.

47:17.973 --> 47:20.704
Let's go!

47:25.706 --> 47:28.437
All right, guys, we're done.
Time to leave. Let's go.

47:28.439 --> 47:31.837
- What happened?
- I just bought us three weeks.

47:31.839 --> 47:33.571
Thank you.

47:33.573 --> 47:36.370
<i>So, maybe the university's board
of trustees does have the right</i>

47:36.372 --> 47:38.004
<i>to expropriate
the church property.</i>

47:38.006 --> 47:40.303
<i>But even if it's legal,
is it moral?</i>

47:40.305 --> 47:41.737
<i>Just take a look
at their dilemma here.</i>

47:41.739 --> 47:43.836
<i>This is no longer
a Christian school.</i>

47:43.838 --> 47:46.504
<i>The church really should have
moved off campus 50 years ago</i>

47:46.506 --> 47:48.436
<i>when the state
bought the university.</i>

47:48.438 --> 47:51.236
<i>Instead, funding
is given disproportionately</i>

47:51.238 --> 47:53.302
<i>to one religious organization</i>

47:53.304 --> 47:54.771
<i>while other ones
are being denied.</i>

47:54.773 --> 47:58.569
<i>So you add that to all of this
controversy and now violence.</i>

47:58.571 --> 48:02.870
<i>You tell me, how can they justify
keeping the church on campus?</i>

48:02.872 --> 48:05.703
<i>Thomas Ellsworth is making
the right choice here.</i>

48:05.705 --> 48:08.571
<i>It's not the easy one,
but it is the right choice.</i>

48:09.705 --> 48:11.736
I think their intentions
are pretty clear.

48:11.738 --> 48:13.569
Enough with writing letters.
Let's call 'em out.

48:13.571 --> 48:15.636
Call 'em out
on what, stupidity?

48:15.638 --> 48:18.703
Why are you so reluctant to
accept what's really going on?

48:18.705 --> 48:21.869
Unbelievable. You guys love to
play the victim card, don't you?

48:21.871 --> 48:23.302
- "You guys."
- Look, forget it.

48:23.304 --> 48:25.836
I'm not engaging in a
false narrative with you.

48:25.838 --> 48:28.903
I'm just... I'm not. It undermines
true religious liberty.

48:28.905 --> 48:32.569
You're talking to a guy who went to jail,
who's now having his church stolen.

48:32.571 --> 48:35.702
- How is that false narrative?
- Because it's never that simple.

48:35.704 --> 48:38.835
The Christian church has a long
history of persecuting people,

48:38.837 --> 48:42.834
and then those people push back,
and you guys want to cry victim.

48:42.836 --> 48:46.835
And for every example of someone who's
misrepresented Jesus for some twisted reason,

48:46.837 --> 48:49.567
there are a hundred others
who have done good in his name.

48:49.569 --> 48:53.435
We can debate history all you
want, but I'm talking about now,

48:53.437 --> 48:55.368
about getting my church back.

48:55.370 --> 48:58.601
- Can you just help me do that?
- I'm right here, aren't I?

48:58.603 --> 49:01.567
Just don't drag me
into your personal crusade.

49:04.369 --> 49:06.503
- Where you going?
- I'm going to bed.

49:10.970 --> 49:12.968
Thank you, Pastor.
I agree.

49:12.970 --> 49:15.967
Appreciate it. Thank you.

49:15.969 --> 49:17.436
Okay.

49:22.435 --> 49:24.333
Pastor Dave.

49:24.335 --> 49:26.700
Keaton, how are you?

49:26.702 --> 49:29.566
I'm okay. So, how's stuff
going with the church?

49:29.568 --> 49:31.833
Have they found
the person who did it?

49:31.835 --> 49:34.433
Not yet. They're still
investigating.

49:34.435 --> 49:37.299
I just figured, like,
fingerprints or whatever.

49:37.301 --> 49:39.733
Ah, it's not quite
like the movies.

49:39.735 --> 49:43.299
It takes time, but I'm sure
they'll catch 'em.

49:43.301 --> 49:46.299
What's gonna happen
when they find 'em?

49:46.301 --> 49:50.501
Put 'em away, I hope,
for a long time.

49:53.468 --> 49:57.699
The order's good for three weeks.
Can't be much longer than that.

49:57.701 --> 50:01.465
Hey, what do you want me to say?
He's my brother.

50:01.467 --> 50:05.899
Do me a favor. Send me some
briefs for <i>Kelo vs. New London.</i>

50:05.901 --> 50:09.766
And what else?
<i>Faith Temple vs. Brighton.</i>

50:09.768 --> 50:11.167
Okay, thanks.

50:34.633 --> 50:37.865
Really, take it with you.
It's getting cold out there.

50:37.867 --> 50:39.600
All right, bye.

50:40.832 --> 50:42.431
Smells good.

50:42.433 --> 50:44.565
Coming to collect
on that rain check.

50:46.867 --> 50:49.296
You guys close
growing up?

50:49.298 --> 50:52.598
Yeah. That's why
it was so hard.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.296
Pearce was my hero.

50:54.298 --> 50:57.331
I mean, he had
this strong faith.

50:57.333 --> 50:59.330
But he was so cool
about it.

50:59.332 --> 51:01.830
He made Christianity cool.

51:01.832 --> 51:03.697
Yeah, I know the type.

51:03.699 --> 51:06.430
Went off to law school
when I started college.

51:06.432 --> 51:09.697
And then something happened. I don't know. He changed.

51:09.699 --> 51:11.230
How?

51:11.232 --> 51:13.563
Uh, I don't know.

51:13.565 --> 51:16.296
I guess he was struggling
in his faith.

51:16.298 --> 51:18.696
But it was more
than just confusion.

51:18.698 --> 51:20.963
It was darker than that.

51:20.965 --> 51:25.297
I always hoped that he'd come
around before our parents died.

51:26.832 --> 51:29.362
It was hard on them.

51:29.364 --> 51:31.729
It felt like
they lost their son.

51:31.731 --> 51:34.596
And you lost your hero.

51:34.598 --> 51:36.963
Yeah. I guess I did.

51:41.431 --> 51:44.362
That's amazing, isn't it?

51:44.364 --> 51:46.296
That he can
look at that...

51:48.563 --> 51:50.430
and see that.

51:55.563 --> 51:57.163
You okay?

51:59.296 --> 52:01.163
I feel a little bit
like I'm drifting.

52:03.430 --> 52:07.562
Keep trying to tell myself all the things
that I would tell others who are struggling.

52:08.697 --> 52:10.295
It's not helping.

52:11.229 --> 52:13.994
Think I might
be bad at my job.

52:13.996 --> 52:15.695
I doubt that.

52:15.697 --> 52:18.696
I just want to get back
to the way things were.

52:19.996 --> 52:21.596
How far back is that?

52:22.997 --> 52:26.427
I mean, going back
doesn't really work.

52:26.429 --> 52:28.227
And believe me,
I've tried.

52:28.229 --> 52:30.293
I've gone back
to school,

52:30.295 --> 52:34.560
gone back home,
back to brunette.

52:34.562 --> 52:38.562
But I've never been able to go
back to the way things were.

52:39.596 --> 52:42.360
I hope you're wrong.

52:42.362 --> 52:45.728
'Cause if I can't go back,
I don't know where to go.

52:55.895 --> 52:57.359
Are you doing okay?

52:57.361 --> 52:58.960
I told you
to stop asking me that.

52:58.962 --> 53:00.726
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

53:00.728 --> 53:02.693
So, how much?

53:02.695 --> 53:04.692
How much what?

53:04.694 --> 53:08.558
We made you an offer. You're
here to counter, so counter.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.960
Oh, believe me,
I wish I could.

53:10.962 --> 53:12.826
Unfortunately,
despite my counsel,

53:12.828 --> 53:15.493
my client is not
interested in money.

53:15.495 --> 53:17.959
- So, what is your client interested in?
- I want my church back.

53:17.961 --> 53:19.825
Dave, be reasonable.

53:19.827 --> 53:21.425
Reason went out
the window, Tom,

53:21.427 --> 53:23.425
when you brought a demolition
crew to my front door.

53:23.427 --> 53:26.692
Look, a college campus is
about education, not religion.

53:26.694 --> 53:29.557
We've got limited space. We need
to maximize it for every student.

53:29.559 --> 53:31.558
None of that gives you the
right to tear my church down.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.324
- Well, actually it does.
- Dana, stop.

53:34.326 --> 53:38.725
We're wasting our time here. We both know
that this meeting was simply a courtesy.

53:38.727 --> 53:42.491
And, Barbara, we appreciate it.
It's very courteous.

53:42.493 --> 53:45.457
I get it.
It's a prime piece of land.

53:45.459 --> 53:47.825
You know what I'd do
if it were me?

53:47.827 --> 53:51.357
I'd put in a big student center
with a fancy coffee shop.

53:51.359 --> 53:52.558
The kids would love it.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.224
I mean, to me, that's more
valuable than a dusty old church.

53:55.226 --> 53:56.557
No offense.

53:56.559 --> 53:58.324
But he knows
how I feel about it.

53:58.326 --> 54:00.557
Here's the problem.

54:00.559 --> 54:03.823
What you're doing,
it's against the law.

54:03.825 --> 54:06.324
'Cause eminent domain
doesn't automatically apply

54:06.326 --> 54:09.724
just because you guys
don't like his church.

54:09.726 --> 54:12.557
So, here's my counter.

54:12.559 --> 54:17.426
Withdraw your claim or we sue. See
what a judge has to say about it.

54:18.458 --> 54:19.592
We're done.

54:23.692 --> 54:25.458
This case will never
make it to court.

54:38.458 --> 54:40.556
They didn't look worried,
Pearce.

54:40.558 --> 54:42.822
Oh, they are. That's their
job, to not look worried.

54:42.824 --> 54:45.756
Listen, we gotta change the
conversation in the media.

54:45.758 --> 54:48.690
Okay, we gotta put a
face to the opposition.

54:48.692 --> 54:50.590
- Tom?
- Yeah, Tom.

54:50.592 --> 54:53.956
He's the most visible. He's got the
most to lose. You okay with that?

54:53.958 --> 54:58.822
I'll just tell the truth. People
need to know what he's doing.

54:58.824 --> 55:00.591
Good boy. Let's go.

55:02.557 --> 55:06.421
<i>But Saint James built
Hadleigh University years ago.</i>

55:06.423 --> 55:08.689
<i>Exactly. So you see how
far this has gone.</i>

55:08.691 --> 55:11.421
<i>And now with
the school board's actions,</i>

55:11.423 --> 55:14.721
<i>we've been given no choice
but to seek a legal solution.</i>

55:14.723 --> 55:17.688
<i>All of these college administrators,
they go on and on and on</i>

55:17.690 --> 55:20.721
<i>about diversity and
tolerance and inclusion,</i>

55:20.723 --> 55:23.821
<i>but yet when it's asked of them,
they run you off of campus.</i>

55:23.823 --> 55:26.421
<i>That doesn't sound very tolerant
or inclusive to me.</i>

55:26.423 --> 55:28.354
<i>Tom Ellsworth
is trying to strip away</i>

55:28.356 --> 55:30.354
<i>the foundational element
of this university</i>

55:30.356 --> 55:33.286
<i>because he believes that
it is no longer convenient.</i>

55:33.288 --> 55:35.588
<i>But truth
isn't about convenience.</i>

55:35.590 --> 55:39.354
<i>And faith in God may not be as
popular on campus as it once was,</i>

55:39.356 --> 55:44.687
<i>but people still have a right, a fundamental
human right, to express their beliefs,</i>

55:44.689 --> 55:47.620
<i>even in a public square
at a state university.</i>

55:47.622 --> 55:51.286
<i>If you agree, we're asking that
you make your voices heard.</i>

55:51.288 --> 55:54.286
<i>Send an e-mail. Make a call.</i>

55:54.288 --> 55:56.553
<i>Let Tom Ellsworth
and the university board know</i>

55:56.555 --> 55:59.953
<i>that you believe the church
still has value.</i>

55:59.955 --> 56:03.954
<i>The gauntlet has been thrown.
And we'll see how people respond.</i>

56:03.956 --> 56:08.552
Dude, almost three million views!
People are mad. This is good.

56:08.554 --> 56:10.953
Does this buy us
the leverage we need?

56:10.955 --> 56:13.719
Well, we'll find out
at the prelim.

56:13.721 --> 56:18.554
Need the judge to let us argue
the case, but... this all helps.

56:20.588 --> 56:23.421
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

56:25.421 --> 56:28.285
<i>I think it's time for me
to get back preaching again.</i>

56:28.287 --> 56:30.853
<i>I'm afraid I'm getting so caught
up in all this, I just...</i>

56:30.855 --> 56:33.419
<i>I don't want to lose sight
of my work, you know.</i>

56:33.421 --> 56:36.686
Well, let me know when and where.
I'll be there for sure.

56:36.688 --> 56:38.752
Hey, we're back.

56:38.754 --> 56:40.752
Oh, I turned it off.

56:40.754 --> 56:43.320
<i>What? Don't you want to see
if they get the diamond?</i>

56:45.286 --> 56:46.585
Don't you knock?

56:46.587 --> 56:48.686
- What are you doing?
- I'm on the phone!

56:48.688 --> 56:51.284
- Who you talking to so late?
- None of your business.

56:51.286 --> 56:52.885
<i>Is that Pearce?
Tell him I said hi.</i>

56:52.887 --> 56:54.418
Meg says hi.

56:54.420 --> 56:56.952
- Hi, Meg.
- Let me call you back.

56:56.954 --> 56:58.852
Ooh, what's
the deal there?

56:58.854 --> 57:00.984
There's no deal.
She's a friend of mine.

57:00.986 --> 57:03.686
She runs one of the
ministries we support.

57:05.286 --> 57:07.283
- What do you want, Pearce?
- Nothing.

57:07.285 --> 57:09.419
- Is that my shirt?
- Yeah.

57:26.319 --> 57:29.851
- What are you doing?
- I told you, this tree's dead. It's gonna fall on the house.

57:29.853 --> 57:33.417
I didn't ask you to cut it down!
I can do it myself!

57:33.419 --> 57:35.552
- Can you, now?
- Yeah, I could.

57:36.419 --> 57:39.419
- Go for it.
- All right, fine.

57:44.351 --> 57:45.718
You might want to back up.

57:48.718 --> 57:50.718
- Gotta do better than that.
- It was a warm-up.

57:55.618 --> 57:57.284
Still warming up?

58:04.952 --> 58:07.215
Careful with that
weak heart of yours.

58:07.217 --> 58:08.950
Ha-ha. Funny guy. Watch this.

58:08.952 --> 58:11.215
Get ready
to yell "timber."

58:11.217 --> 58:13.682
I got a better idea.

58:15.851 --> 58:19.283
Oh, now we're talking.
Yeah!

58:28.317 --> 58:31.149
- Okay, give it a push.
- All right, hold up.

58:32.416 --> 58:34.584
- Tell me when you're ready.
- Yeah! Go!

58:35.816 --> 58:37.417
Ah! We almost got it!

58:39.416 --> 58:41.416
Oh! Yeah!

58:43.816 --> 58:45.149
Yes!

58:49.816 --> 58:53.214
Just promise me you'll
plant something new here.

58:53.216 --> 58:54.583
Mom liked
pomegranate trees.

58:58.483 --> 59:02.713
Do you even believe
in what we're fighting for?

59:02.715 --> 59:05.413
Do I believe in your right
to keep your church? Yes.

59:05.415 --> 59:08.148
But the rest of it,
you know the answer.

59:09.281 --> 59:11.547
So, why help me?

59:11.549 --> 59:13.546
What do you think
I do for a living?

59:13.548 --> 59:15.347
Do you think I need
to have the belief system

59:15.349 --> 59:18.446
of every crackhead
I defend to defend 'em?

59:18.448 --> 59:22.680
So, religion has no value except
for the laws that protect it?

59:22.682 --> 59:26.947
Value? I don't know.
But people have evolved.

59:26.949 --> 59:29.613
Science has replaced
superstition.

59:29.615 --> 59:32.747
- Church has outlived its usefulness.
- Wow!

59:32.749 --> 59:36.413
Okay, I don't expect you to agree, but
that's okay 'cause this is healthy.

59:36.415 --> 59:38.279
It's a healthy discourse.

59:38.281 --> 59:41.946
Pearce, people are broken.
They're... They're lost.

59:41.948 --> 59:45.278
They're searching
for meaning, for purpose.

59:45.280 --> 59:47.679
Church is the answer
to those problems, huh?

59:47.681 --> 59:52.812
Church is a place for people to seek, to
grapple with those difficult questions.

59:52.814 --> 59:55.581
To find hope and...
and truth.

59:56.681 --> 01:00:00.745
And you know that.
Or at least you used to.

01:00:00.747 --> 01:00:05.411
Why do you need me to agree with you
about everything? I'm just your lawyer.

01:00:05.413 --> 01:00:09.279
I didn't come here to debate
religion or do your landscaping.

01:00:10.581 --> 01:00:12.411
But, man,
you're my little brother.

01:00:12.413 --> 01:00:15.811
And I don't like to see
people push you around.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.945
And that's why
I'm helping you.

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:20.680
And right now, that answer's
gotta be good enough for you.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.678
<i>Now, this whole situation
brings you to the cross.</i>

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.878
<i>And the cross is both
vertical and horizontal.</i>

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.444
<i>Vertical is me and God,
God and me.</i>

01:00:34.446 --> 01:00:36.210
<i>My relationship with Christ.</i>

01:00:36.212 --> 01:00:38.344
The horizontal part,
you and I.

01:00:38.346 --> 01:00:40.677
Sometimes we get so
caught up in the vertical

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:43.677
we forget the horizontal,
forget each other.

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:47.210
Yeah, but it's at the intersection
where Jesus comes in.

01:00:47.212 --> 01:00:50.977
<i>That nexus, and that's where Paul's words in
Galatians are so powerful and compelling.</i>

01:00:50.979 --> 01:00:53.342
<i>Even Jews and gentiles
are fellow citizens.</i>

01:00:53.344 --> 01:00:56.876
<i>So, with all the noise
and anger out there right now,</i>

01:00:56.878 --> 01:00:58.876
<i>it's peace
that we have to think about.</i>

01:00:58.878 --> 01:01:02.476
<i>And it's gonna require one thing...
It's gonna require sacrificing.</i>

01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:05.476
<i>At the end of the day, we can't
forget that Christ's forgiveness</i>

01:01:05.478 --> 01:01:07.844
<i>came about via the conduit
of the sacrifice.</i>

01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:11.743
<i>And we are called, believe
it or not, to do the same.</i>

01:01:23.744 --> 01:01:25.410
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:29.543
How are you?

01:01:31.745 --> 01:01:33.678
Been better.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.677
Do you know why my mom
divorced my dad?

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.542
He used to beat her.

01:01:50.276 --> 01:01:53.677
I was nine...
when she left him.

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.276
You know what
our church did?

01:02:01.943 --> 01:02:03.576
They called her a sinner.

01:02:05.844 --> 01:02:09.542
They said that if she married
again, she'd be an adulterer.

01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:13.941
They humiliated her.

01:02:13.943 --> 01:02:16.741
What I remember most
about that time

01:02:16.743 --> 01:02:20.273
is the sound of my mother
crying herself to sleep.

01:02:20.275 --> 01:02:22.476
I'm so sorry. I...

01:02:26.541 --> 01:02:28.676
So, yeah,
I get angry sometimes.

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:33.873
But I didn't... I didn't mean
for anybody to get hurt.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:35.675
I know you didn't.

01:02:42.341 --> 01:02:44.541
For what it's worth,
I prayed about it.

01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:48.407
And?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.307
No answer.

01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:01.272
And did you believe him?

01:03:01.274 --> 01:03:02.672
Of course
I believed him.

01:03:02.674 --> 01:03:05.806
I was seven years old. I
believed whatever he told me.

01:03:05.808 --> 01:03:08.338
"Dave, you can make
your own 7 Up.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.674
All you need is just
water and salt."

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.672
- Did you drink it?
- It was terrible, obviously.

01:03:15.674 --> 01:03:17.938
But I kept adding
more and more salt,

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.205
just waiting for
those little bubbles.

01:03:21.207 --> 01:03:26.939
Oh, poor guy. He drank the whole bottle.
Two liters of saltwater.

01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:29.537
But I gotta
hand it to Pearce.

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:34.537
He waited by my bedside all night
long to make sure that I didn't die.

01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:37.404
Yeah. That's what brothers do.
They look out for each other.

01:03:37.406 --> 01:03:39.537
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear, Brother.

01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:40.638
Thank you.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.803
I really thought you were gonna die.

01:03:43.805 --> 01:03:48.436
<i>Hadleigh University is being flooded with
calls and e-mails from angry citizens,</i>

01:03:48.438 --> 01:03:50.804
<i>and it seems
Chancellor Ellsworth,</i>

01:03:50.806 --> 01:03:52.673
<i>well, taking the brunt
of that anger.</i>

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:05.472
Kayla's asking
for her bedtime story.

01:04:10.338 --> 01:04:12.271
Don't answer it, Tom.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.405
Hello?

01:04:20.704 --> 01:04:22.271
Hello!

01:04:22.804 --> 01:04:24.970
Hel... Stop calling me.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.402
- What was that?
- Stay here, stay here!

01:04:28.404 --> 01:04:29.803
What?

01:04:29.805 --> 01:04:30.936
Daddy!

01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:32.969
Kayla! Come here, baby.

01:04:40.937 --> 01:04:43.270
What was that?

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:47.536
Go on upstairs.

01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:52.571
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

01:04:55.803 --> 01:04:58.268
I'm very proud of you.

01:04:58.270 --> 01:05:01.668
Of me? For what?

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:05.534
I get the feeling fighting's
not really your thing.

01:05:05.536 --> 01:05:08.600
But it's important,
what you're doing.

01:05:08.602 --> 01:05:10.136
It's inspiring.

01:05:12.603 --> 01:05:15.401
I was just thinking
about that sculptor,

01:05:15.403 --> 01:05:17.470
chiseling away
at that rock.

01:05:19.403 --> 01:05:22.400
It's okay to be broken,
Dave.

01:05:22.402 --> 01:05:25.266
It means God's
still shaping you.

01:05:25.268 --> 01:05:28.402
I'm honored to be a part of it.

01:05:31.402 --> 01:05:32.133
Tom?

01:05:32.135 --> 01:05:33.934
I'm getting
death threats, Dave!

01:05:33.936 --> 01:05:36.734
Somebody threw a brick
through my window!

01:05:36.736 --> 01:05:39.533
- Okay, just take it easy, okay?
- No, Kayla could've been hurt!

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:42.266
- I don't know anything about that. I'm sorry.
- No, no. You did this!

01:05:42.268 --> 01:05:43.567
Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:45.135
Pearce!

01:05:47.669 --> 01:05:51.134
Hey! Get off him!

01:05:55.267 --> 01:05:58.135
You brought
the fight to us, Tom.

01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.301
I'll get you some ice.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.534
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.264
Maybe we should
just call it a night.

01:06:23.266 --> 01:06:26.600
Yeah. I'll...
I'll just get my stuff.

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:36.298
I didn't realize
Tom was a psychopath.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.567
Well, he's just scared.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.133
Thanks.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.832
Way to impress the lady,
by the way.

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:48.263
Well, it's kind of
my signature move.

01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:50.798
Invite a girl over and then
get punched in the face.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.531
Works every time.

01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:53.699
Let's see.

01:06:57.266 --> 01:06:59.265
Ow. What'd you
do that for?

01:07:00.532 --> 01:07:01.566
You'll be all right.

01:07:05.866 --> 01:07:08.864
<i>Cottonwood Christian Center vs.
Cypress Redevelopment Agency?</i>

01:07:08.866 --> 01:07:10.530
I got that.
Give me something else.

01:07:10.532 --> 01:07:12.430
Hey, I got
some leftover pizza.

01:07:12.432 --> 01:07:14.131
Yeah.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.397
Josh, you're a smart kid.
Why'd you give up on law school?

01:07:18.399 --> 01:07:20.397
Well, I wouldn't say
I gave up on it.

01:07:20.399 --> 01:07:22.529
Once I spent time
on a college campus,

01:07:22.531 --> 01:07:24.396
I realized there was
a real need there.

01:07:24.398 --> 01:07:26.429
Ministry's just another way
for me to serve.

01:07:26.431 --> 01:07:28.262
What kind of law
were you studying?

01:07:28.264 --> 01:07:30.796
Same as you.
Civil rights, social justice.

01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:32.963
Really? 'Cause you don't
strike me as a liberal.

01:07:32.965 --> 01:07:35.796
- Give the kid a break.
- What?

01:07:35.798 --> 01:07:39.596
I don't think standing up for the oppressed
is exclusive to a political agenda.

01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:41.262
Well, let me ask you this.

01:07:41.264 --> 01:07:43.863
Do you think that
your religious beliefs

01:07:43.865 --> 01:07:45.695
get in the way of
real social change?

01:07:45.697 --> 01:07:47.830
No, my beliefs are
the foundation of change.

01:07:47.832 --> 01:07:50.261
The belief that every human
is made in the image of God.

01:07:50.263 --> 01:07:53.529
I mean, Jesus was the ultimate
social justice warrior.

01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:55.595
He said the lives
of children mattered

01:07:55.597 --> 01:07:57.795
and regarded women
with honor and dignity

01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:00.662
in a cultural moment where a woman's
testimony wasn't even permissible

01:08:00.664 --> 01:08:02.662
in a court of law.

01:08:02.664 --> 01:08:05.862
He consistently stood up for the
mistreated and the marginalized.

01:08:05.864 --> 01:08:07.527
Well, I've been doing this
a long time,

01:08:07.529 --> 01:08:10.394
and I wish I'd seen those words
put into action more often.

01:08:10.396 --> 01:08:13.260
Yeah. Me too. We're all
responsible for our part,

01:08:13.262 --> 01:08:16.295
but it's grace and then justice,
not the other way around.

01:08:16.296 --> 01:08:18.560
Why do you serve the court,
not the Lord?

01:08:18.563 --> 01:08:22.861
We should follow the example of Jesus
because... without grace as our goal,

01:08:22.863 --> 01:08:25.327
we're just, you know...
we're just fighting.

01:08:25.328 --> 01:08:28.162
Amen.
Let's say grace.

01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:33.461
Dear Lord, thank you for this day.
Thank you for this food.

01:08:33.462 --> 01:08:36.828
Bless it to our bodies and forgive
Pearce for eating before grace.

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:39.261
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:41.563
That's not funny.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.526
So, if the judge agrees to let
us go to trial, do we have a shot?

01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:49.426
If we go to
trial, we're gonna win.

01:08:49.428 --> 01:08:51.527
Public's on our side,
jury's on our side.

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:53.792
- What if the judge says no?
- Then we're done.

01:08:53.795 --> 01:08:55.926
Great.

01:08:55.929 --> 01:08:57.926
Am I allowed
to talk in there?

01:08:57.929 --> 01:08:59.526
Please don't.

01:08:59.528 --> 01:09:01.526
You know, I've been
thinking, I like this Meg.

01:09:01.528 --> 01:09:04.460
She's the good kind
of Christian, authentic.

01:09:04.462 --> 01:09:06.960
You ought to seal the deal
before she gets wise.

01:09:06.962 --> 01:09:09.524
It's not exactly great timing.

01:09:09.527 --> 01:09:11.526
Maybe I don't want to
rush into things.

01:09:11.528 --> 01:09:13.560
Try not to end up
with two ex-wives.

01:09:13.562 --> 01:09:16.926
I forgot to tell you.
It's three now.

01:09:16.928 --> 01:09:18.792
Three?

01:09:18.794 --> 01:09:22.292
Hadleigh offered a sum that's fair
market value for the property.

01:09:22.294 --> 01:09:23.692
It's perfectly fair.

01:09:23.694 --> 01:09:27.459
But Saint James' value can't
be measured only in dollars.

01:09:27.461 --> 01:09:30.392
The court has no standard
for determining intrinsic value.

01:09:30.394 --> 01:09:33.392
Your Honor, Saint James
has had a positive impact

01:09:33.394 --> 01:09:35.392
on this community
for generations.

01:09:35.394 --> 01:09:37.692
The university concedes the
plaintiff is not without merit,

01:09:37.694 --> 01:09:40.459
but we question
the relevancy to this case.

01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:43.926
- May I say something?
- You brought the lawsuit.

01:09:43.928 --> 01:09:48.558
If you want to assess the value of the church
to this community, just turn on the news.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.126
The community
is speaking loudly.

01:09:54.259 --> 01:09:57.560
This is what victory feels like.
We're going to court!

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:02.291
Come on, man, this is a big win.
Be happy.

01:10:02.293 --> 01:10:04.291
- Ow!
- Be happy!

01:10:04.293 --> 01:10:05.791
- Stop it.
- Be happy.

01:10:05.793 --> 01:10:07.324
Ow! Will you just...

01:10:07.326 --> 01:10:09.791
Be happy. Oh!
There's my little brother!

01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:11.791
No, I'm not happy
suing my friend.

01:10:11.793 --> 01:10:14.391
I'm not happy
suing anybody.

01:10:14.393 --> 01:10:17.924
Okay. Well, number one, Tom
Ellsworth is not your friend.

01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:21.559
And number two, I'm going to
bed, 'cause you're a buzzkill.

01:10:27.525 --> 01:10:30.824
Paul tells us that
even if you can speak

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:34.390
the language
of both man and angels,

01:10:34.392 --> 01:10:37.523
if you lack love,
brothers and sisters,

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:40.256
you're just making
a lot of noise.

01:10:40.258 --> 01:10:44.522
<i>Maybe you're
the world's smartest person</i>

01:10:44.524 --> 01:10:48.422
<i>and you have a great faith
that can move mountains,</i>

01:10:48.424 --> 01:10:50.823
or you give all your money
to the poor,

01:10:50.825 --> 01:10:53.723
or you give your body
over to hardship.

01:10:53.725 --> 01:11:00.124
My Bible says, without love...
you're saying nothing.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:03.657
<i>Without love,
you gain nothing.</i>

01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:07.956
And without love...
you are nothing.

01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.922
Hey, Adam. Hey!

01:11:28.924 --> 01:11:30.254
Pastor Dave?

01:11:30.256 --> 01:11:33.253
- Is it true?
- I don't... I don't know.

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:34.922
- Is it? Tell me!
- Adam!

01:11:36.956 --> 01:11:39.921
- You killed Jude, didn't you?
- Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, pal.

01:11:39.923 --> 01:11:42.922
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.522
What is wrong
with you?

01:11:48.522 --> 01:11:50.287
Hey, man,
what is going on?

01:11:54.322 --> 01:11:56.154
That is bad stuff.

01:12:08.923 --> 01:12:10.520
Know what I'm saying?

01:12:10.522 --> 01:12:12.920
I just took your fingerprints
and he's gonna book you.

01:12:12.922 --> 01:12:14.786
Is this, like,
a mug shot?

01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:16.920
Yes. Stand there.

01:12:16.922 --> 01:12:18.653
<i>After a shocking confrontation</i>

01:12:18.655 --> 01:12:21.319
<i>by Reverend David Hill
on Hadleigh campus,</i>

01:12:21.321 --> 01:12:26.652
<i>the suspect has been identified as 21-year-old
Hadleigh student Adam Richertson.</i>

01:12:26.654 --> 01:12:30.920
<i>The college senior has no criminal
record and no history of violence,</i>

01:12:30.922 --> 01:12:36.254
<i>which has left many people wondering what
inspired his deadly attack on a church.</i>

01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:42.253
I'm so sorry.

01:12:46.387 --> 01:12:48.585
This is beyond messed up.

01:12:48.587 --> 01:12:52.819
I know Adam. He's a
good dude, sincerely.

01:12:52.821 --> 01:12:56.518
And Pastor Dave needs to take
a page from his own book.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.951
So, you know what? We're
having a protest Friday night.

01:12:59.953 --> 01:13:03.517
Saint James. Make sure
your voice is heard.

01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:07.553
Be there. Be mad. 'Cause
this fight is far from over.

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:12.554
Have you seen this?

01:13:15.252 --> 01:13:16.918
Media works both ways.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.918
This gives us
a real shot.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.653
Get the team working on it. I'm gonna
send a gift basket to Reverend Dave.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.384
We condemn the hateful
actions of Adam Richertson

01:13:33.386 --> 01:13:36.451
in the strongest possible terms.

01:13:36.453 --> 01:13:40.650
They do not represent the values of
our esteemed Hadleigh University.

01:13:40.652 --> 01:13:44.316
We will not stand for
violence or discrimination

01:13:44.318 --> 01:13:47.383
in any form, of any people,

01:13:47.385 --> 01:13:51.516
regardless of their religious
backgrounds and beliefs.

01:13:51.518 --> 01:13:54.650
We've taken the immediate steps
to expel Mr. Richertson,

01:13:54.652 --> 01:13:58.183
and we have encouraged
the state to prosecute him

01:13:58.185 --> 01:14:01.782
to the fullest extent
of the law.

01:14:01.784 --> 01:14:04.917
None of this, however,
should excuse

01:14:04.919 --> 01:14:07.582
the actions
of Reverend Dave Hill.

01:14:07.584 --> 01:14:11.949
His outburst has made
our position stronger...

01:14:11.951 --> 01:14:17.682
that Saint James Church has become a
beacon of violence and controversy,

01:14:17.684 --> 01:14:23.649
and it has no place here
on Hadleigh University campus.

01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:24.782
Good day.

01:14:31.416 --> 01:14:34.582
<i>So, Reverend Hill goes after Ellsworth.
Now Ellsworth fires back.</i>

01:14:34.584 --> 01:14:37.548
<i>And meanwhile, this kid Adam Richertson
is caught in the cross fire.</i>

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.581
<i>Judge, this kid
killed somebody.</i>

01:14:39.583 --> 01:14:41.514
<i>Oh, come on. It was an accident.
Everybody knows that.</i>

01:14:41.516 --> 01:14:42.916
<i>The judge and jury's
gonna decide that.</i>

01:14:42.918 --> 01:14:44.015
<i>Speaking of judge and jury,</i>

01:14:44.017 --> 01:14:45.181
<i>who's gonna hold
this reverend accountable?</i>

01:14:45.183 --> 01:14:49.247
<i>Okay, there's a big difference
between a death and a fight.</i>

01:14:49.249 --> 01:14:50.915
<i>This reverend
did attack this kid,</i>

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:53.246
<i>and now he's calling for the kid
to get put away for 30 years?</i>

01:14:53.248 --> 01:14:54.648
<i>That's insane.</i>

01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:57.247
<i>And there you have it.
Both sides are totally fired up.</i>

01:14:57.249 --> 01:14:59.247
<i>Huge protest is planned
for the weekend.</i>

01:14:59.249 --> 01:15:01.513
<i>And this is teed up
for disaster.</i>

01:15:01.515 --> 01:15:03.380
<i>That's the sign of the times,
isn't it?</i>

01:15:03.382 --> 01:15:06.115
<i>Everybody's yelling.
Nobody's listening.</i>

01:15:07.515 --> 01:15:09.683
It doesn't make sense.
Nothing makes sense.

01:15:11.248 --> 01:15:14.314
Adam never meant
to hurt anyone.

01:15:14.316 --> 01:15:17.513
I'm not saying he shouldn't
own up to what he did,

01:15:17.515 --> 01:15:19.914
but I just don't see
God's mercy here.

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:21.547
Especially
not from Pastor Dave.

01:15:21.549 --> 01:15:23.380
He's human, Keaton.

01:15:23.382 --> 01:15:25.380
Yeah, but he's supposed
to be a man of God.

01:15:25.382 --> 01:15:27.280
What kind of example
is that?

01:15:27.282 --> 01:15:30.513
I mean, if being a Christian
doesn't affect the way we act,

01:15:30.515 --> 01:15:35.913
then... how do we actually know
that our values and beliefs

01:15:35.915 --> 01:15:38.548
are any more valid
than anyone else's?

01:15:41.848 --> 01:15:43.448
Can I show you something?

01:15:47.648 --> 01:15:50.380
A friend said this to me
when I was in high school.

01:15:58.247 --> 01:15:59.912
It was inspiring.

01:15:59.914 --> 01:16:03.247
It's why I came to Hadleigh. I
wanted to be a part of something.

01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:08.648
At the time, I'd never even
considered that God could be dead.

01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:14.146
But now...

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.311
It's okay, Keaton. It's good
to ask difficult questions.

01:16:22.313 --> 01:16:26.644
God can use it. He's not
afraid of your uncertainty.

01:16:26.646 --> 01:16:28.245
But I am.

01:16:29.914 --> 01:16:32.778
You know, I think about
John the Baptist.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.644
If anyone should've been sure
about Jesus, it was him.

01:16:35.646 --> 01:16:38.244
And John said, "I've
seen, and I testify

01:16:38.246 --> 01:16:40.644
that this is
the Son of God."

01:16:40.646 --> 01:16:45.243
And then he got locked up
in Herod's little jail cell,

01:16:45.245 --> 01:16:46.911
and the doubts started
messing with his head.

01:16:46.913 --> 01:16:48.143
"What if I'm wrong
about this Jesus guy?

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:50.777
What if all the stories I've heard
about him healing people...

01:16:50.779 --> 01:16:52.777
What if
it's just ridiculous?"

01:16:52.779 --> 01:16:56.910
So John sent some of his friends
to watch Jesus and report back.

01:16:56.912 --> 01:17:01.445
And Jesus told them, "Tell John
what you've seen and heard.

01:17:02.645 --> 01:17:05.643
The blind receive their sight.
The lame walk.

01:17:05.645 --> 01:17:09.111
The lepers are cleansed.
The deaf hear."

01:17:10.178 --> 01:17:11.676
John needed to doubt.

01:17:11.678 --> 01:17:13.376
Why, though?

01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:17.244
Because uncertainty led
to the pursuit of truth.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:25.144
I know it hurts...
to be in the fire.

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:31.410
And as painful and confusing
as all of this is...

01:17:32.777 --> 01:17:35.677
it just might be exactly
where God wants you right now.

01:17:39.243 --> 01:17:41.642
Well, it ain't good.

01:17:41.644 --> 01:17:45.241
Public opinion, your reputation...
It's all gonna take a hit.

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:46.709
I guess we're gonna
have to wait and see.

01:17:46.711 --> 01:17:49.507
The kid confessed,
so that helps.

01:17:49.509 --> 01:17:51.240
I just wanna know
what you were thinking.

01:17:51.242 --> 01:17:53.508
I wasn't thinking,
obviously.

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:56.275
You get an anonymous text,
then you go nuts on somebody?

01:17:56.277 --> 01:17:58.643
I'm not interested
in rehashing this, okay?

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.376
Sorry, folks.

01:18:15.241 --> 01:18:17.541
- What's going on with you?
- I'm a mess!

01:18:17.543 --> 01:18:20.507
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't
know what God wants me to do.

01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:22.441
And I don't know why any
of this is even happening!

01:18:22.443 --> 01:18:25.274
- First, you gotta settle down.
- Oh, I'm sure this is fun for you.

01:18:25.276 --> 01:18:28.406
You get a front-row seat to watch your
little brother, Dave, just self-destruct.

01:18:28.408 --> 01:18:31.108
That's probably why you drove
down here in the first place.

01:18:36.642 --> 01:18:39.573
- Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm walking.

01:18:39.575 --> 01:18:42.406
- You can't.
- Watch me.

01:18:42.408 --> 01:18:43.442
Pearce.

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:47.373
What?

01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:49.505
You have the car keys.

01:19:28.908 --> 01:19:31.674
- Dave.
- Hey, Roland.

01:19:33.907 --> 01:19:37.239
- How you doing?
- Doing all right.

01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:42.504
You're sure on TV a lot
for someone doing all right.

01:19:42.506 --> 01:19:46.304
All this business with Tom
Ellsworth, and now the boy.

01:19:46.306 --> 01:19:47.771
Well, I didn't ask
for this fight.

01:19:47.773 --> 01:19:50.905
That's a fact, but here it is.

01:19:50.907 --> 01:19:54.236
Keep your eye on
what's important.

01:19:54.238 --> 01:19:55.571
I think what's important

01:19:55.573 --> 01:19:58.837
is that Christians stop
rolling over all the time.

01:19:58.839 --> 01:20:01.171
When is it
our right to fight?

01:20:01.173 --> 01:20:02.804
I'm tired of being
pushed around.

01:20:02.806 --> 01:20:04.904
I'm tired of turning
the other cheek.

01:20:04.906 --> 01:20:06.904
Oh, so now you're tired.

01:20:06.906 --> 01:20:09.303
A minute ago,
you were doing all right.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:12.672
I'm just saying, I think it's time that
Christians stand up for themselves.

01:20:15.505 --> 01:20:17.439
Mmm. Well...

01:20:18.672 --> 01:20:24.636
People were drawn to Jesus
because of his... his love.

01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:26.904
His patience and kindness.

01:20:26.906 --> 01:20:30.369
He managed to preach
the truth

01:20:30.371 --> 01:20:33.536
without losing himself
in the bargain.

01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:38.502
He was gentle with the meek and
hard as a rock with the arrogant.

01:20:38.504 --> 01:20:40.636
And when he talked
to the foolish,

01:20:40.638 --> 01:20:43.502
he was patient

01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:46.371
and never became
a fool himself.

01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:50.435
And he was never proud,
David.

01:20:50.437 --> 01:20:52.671
This has nothing to do
with pride, Roland.

01:20:54.504 --> 01:20:57.802
And no offense, but maybe you'd
understand a little better

01:20:57.804 --> 01:20:59.503
if you were the one
being attacked.

01:21:00.637 --> 01:21:02.835
Brother, who do you think
you're talking to?

01:21:02.837 --> 01:21:04.368
I'm a black preacher
in the Deep South.

01:21:04.370 --> 01:21:08.637
I could build you a church with all the
bricks been thrown through my windows.

01:21:10.704 --> 01:21:13.235
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.370
You gotta work through the pain.

01:21:20.502 --> 01:21:24.103
We cannot respond to hate
with more hate.

01:21:24.904 --> 01:21:26.636
And don't forget...

01:21:29.235 --> 01:21:34.235
we are called to be a light
in the darkness.

01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:46.235
I miss Jude.

01:21:52.902 --> 01:21:55.101
And I miss you too, Lord.

01:21:58.235 --> 01:22:00.568
I'm trying to do the right thing.
I just...

01:22:04.234 --> 01:22:06.568
I don't know
what that is anymore.

01:22:11.668 --> 01:22:13.766
Hey there.

01:22:13.768 --> 01:22:15.568
Just checking on you.

01:22:17.501 --> 01:22:21.500
I saw the news. I can't
imagine what you're feeling.

01:22:22.268 --> 01:22:24.231
<i>I'd like to see you.</i>

01:22:24.233 --> 01:22:27.231
<i>How about a little adventure?</i>

01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:29.365
<i>I'm gonna send you
a dropped pin.</i>

01:22:29.367 --> 01:22:31.367
<i>I'll meet you there
in an hour?</i>

01:22:34.767 --> 01:22:36.899
It's my church away from church.

01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:39.100
It's where I come
to be alone with God.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:42.434
I can see why.

01:22:46.233 --> 01:22:49.230
What do you got there?

01:22:49.232 --> 01:22:52.634
I light a candle
for people I'm praying for.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:58.499
Folks I meet at the restaurant,
friends from AA.

01:22:59.633 --> 01:23:00.633
You.

01:23:04.766 --> 01:23:09.496
I just love the way he uses
other people in our lives to...

01:23:09.498 --> 01:23:15.566
to bring us comfort, to...
remind us that we're loved.

01:23:18.399 --> 01:23:21.398
I think you need
to be reminded right now.

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.632
God is here.

01:23:26.833 --> 01:23:28.432
I'm here.

01:23:30.699 --> 01:23:32.365
And you're loved.

01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:52.762
I thought you were out
with Meg.

01:23:52.764 --> 01:23:55.228
You screw that up too?

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.929
What are you doing?

01:23:56.931 --> 01:23:59.295
Listen, I'm gonna fly
back to Chicago tonight.

01:23:59.297 --> 01:24:02.228
I left you the name and number
of an attorney friend of mine.

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:05.562
She'll take good care
of you. My treat.

01:24:05.564 --> 01:24:08.361
Why? Just because
we had an argument?

01:24:08.363 --> 01:24:10.829
- It's just time.
- Pearce, are you kidding me?

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:16.362
You know what? Go ahead.

01:24:16.364 --> 01:24:18.795
Oh, I haven't done enough
for you, huh?

01:24:18.797 --> 01:24:20.561
Come down here,
put my life on hold.

01:24:20.563 --> 01:24:23.628
What, I'm the bad guy now
'cause I'm bailing? Is that it?

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:25.928
Let's not get into it.
It's not worth it.

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:29.227
No, I-I think it's worth it.
Let's get into it.

01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:32.227
It's water under the bridge.
I forgave you years ago.

01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:36.227
You forgave me? For what exactly?
For leaving?

01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:38.494
You forced me out. You and Mom and Dad.
All you.

01:24:38.496 --> 01:24:41.494
- Give me a break. No one forced you out.
- Oh, yes, you did!

01:24:41.496 --> 01:24:44.261
I wasn't welcome in this house once
I started asking tough questions.

01:24:44.263 --> 01:24:46.527
Is that what they were?
Tough questions?

01:24:46.529 --> 01:24:49.661
"Oh, why does God allow bad
things to happen to good people?"

01:24:49.663 --> 01:24:52.226
Or, "How do we even know
God exists?" Really?

01:24:52.228 --> 01:24:53.160
Just back off,
little brother.

01:24:53.162 --> 01:24:55.226
Maybe you were just
trying to impress a coed

01:24:55.228 --> 01:24:57.560
with how worldly and
forward thinking you were.

01:24:57.562 --> 01:24:59.760
I guess your Christian
roots were too provincial.

01:24:59.762 --> 01:25:02.927
At least I know what's happening in the
world five miles outside the county line!

01:25:02.929 --> 01:25:04.760
You're right,
I don't know!

01:25:04.762 --> 01:25:06.526
And I don't know why
you left me

01:25:06.528 --> 01:25:08.927
to take care of Mom and
Dad when they were sick!

01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:12.627
Why did you leave me to take care
of everything after they were gone?

01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:15.627
Do you have any idea what
you did to Mom and Dad?

01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:16.893
You broke their hearts!

01:25:16.895 --> 01:25:19.359
You're the one
that broke my heart!

01:25:19.361 --> 01:25:21.826
You really don't get that,
do you?

01:25:21.828 --> 01:25:25.225
You didn't take the time to
understand what I was going through.

01:25:25.227 --> 01:25:29.159
I was trying to sort out
my own faith!

01:25:29.161 --> 01:25:31.259
My own sense of God!

01:25:31.261 --> 01:25:34.759
I was changing, and you
all hated me for it.

01:25:34.761 --> 01:25:37.261
And that's the truth, David.

01:27:17.224 --> 01:27:19.223
What am I doing wrong?

01:27:22.757 --> 01:27:24.524
Just show me.

01:27:29.357 --> 01:27:30.624
Please.

01:28:25.621 --> 01:28:27.887
<i>As the battle
rages on in Hope Springs,</i>

01:28:27.889 --> 01:28:30.486
<i>police say they're expecting
hundreds of students and locals</i>

01:28:30.488 --> 01:28:33.753
<i>for a protest outside
Saint James Church.</i>

01:28:33.755 --> 01:28:37.355
<i>Some showing support for the church...</i>

01:28:42.354 --> 01:28:43.487
Keaton.

01:28:44.654 --> 01:28:48.385
Did you ever even stop to ask
why Adam threw that brick?

01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:50.752
He's tired of feeling
judged and rejected

01:28:50.754 --> 01:28:54.485
by the people who should
be loving and accepting.

01:28:54.487 --> 01:28:56.752
You want to know why our
generation's leaving the church?

01:28:56.754 --> 01:28:59.485
It's because the whole world
knows what the church is against

01:28:59.487 --> 01:29:02.354
but it's getting harder and
harder to know what it's for.

01:29:04.754 --> 01:29:06.486
You're right.

01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:13.086
There's something I need to do.
Will you come with me?

01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:19.420
Pastor Dave is here to see you...
if you want.

01:29:21.787 --> 01:29:23.651
Sure.

01:29:23.653 --> 01:29:25.219
Okay.

01:29:47.485 --> 01:29:49.552
I'm the one
that sent you that message.

01:29:52.819 --> 01:29:54.619
I needed you to know.

01:29:59.785 --> 01:30:02.749
I guess I was hoping
that you'd...

01:30:02.751 --> 01:30:04.351
Forgive.

01:30:12.751 --> 01:30:15.217
This is, uh...
This is Jude's Bible.

01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:23.618
He'd want you
to have it.

01:30:33.751 --> 01:30:35.815
I'm so sorry.

01:30:38.217 --> 01:30:42.116
About Jude,
I am so... sorry.

01:30:59.483 --> 01:31:03.347
We want to plead
for leniency for Adam.

01:31:03.349 --> 01:31:05.414
I'm the only witness
the state has.

01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:07.347
I'll tell the DA
what I saw,

01:31:07.349 --> 01:31:09.914
that Jude's death couldn't
have been premeditated.

01:31:09.916 --> 01:31:14.514
I spoke with Jude's parents.
They feel the same.

01:31:14.516 --> 01:31:18.480
We're hoping the state
will agree to a lesser charge.

01:31:18.482 --> 01:31:20.781
Drop it from a felony
to a misdemeanor.

01:31:20.783 --> 01:31:23.480
Hopefully, he doesn't have
to do any more jail time.

01:31:23.482 --> 01:31:24.680
Why?

01:31:24.682 --> 01:31:28.082
The boy shouldn't be collateral
damage for our fight, Tom.

01:31:32.683 --> 01:31:35.646
There's gonna be a big protest
tonight at the church.

01:31:35.648 --> 01:31:38.280
Town's on edge. The whole
thing has gone too far.

01:31:38.282 --> 01:31:40.746
- Didn't have to.
- You're right.

01:31:40.748 --> 01:31:42.481
And I'm sorry.

01:31:44.481 --> 01:31:46.481
I truly am.

01:31:48.682 --> 01:31:51.214
For everything.

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:02.480
Me too. My part.

01:32:11.415 --> 01:32:13.679
So, what about
the church?

01:32:13.681 --> 01:32:17.278
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.211
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:32:20.213 --> 01:32:22.912
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:32:42.346 --> 01:32:44.878
Can I talk to them?
This is my church.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.612
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:32:56.212 --> 01:33:00.377
One God! One truth!
One God! One truth!

01:33:00.379 --> 01:33:03.478
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:05.610
One God!

01:33:05.612 --> 01:33:08.143
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:33:08.145 --> 01:33:10.743
The church must go!
Enough is enough!

01:33:12.745 --> 01:33:15.478
May I have your attention?

01:33:16.645 --> 01:33:18.610
Can I please say something?

01:33:18.612 --> 01:33:20.610
Get out of here!

01:33:20.612 --> 01:33:23.877
Excuse me. May I just say...

01:33:23.879 --> 01:33:25.611
May I say something?

01:33:29.344 --> 01:33:31.478
Can I please say something?

01:33:33.210 --> 01:33:37.411
Please! Please! Let's hear
what the man has to say.

01:33:38.878 --> 01:33:40.477
Thank you.

01:33:43.611 --> 01:33:45.411
I came here tonight...

01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:49.544
to ask all of you
for your forgiveness.

01:33:53.344 --> 01:33:55.611
The other night, I stood
before this burnt altar...

01:33:57.677 --> 01:34:01.244
and I heard God's voice for the
first time in a long time.

01:34:03.343 --> 01:34:05.209
Couldn't have been clearer.

01:34:07.376 --> 01:34:12.342
He said, "This building...
is not my church."

01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:16.108
Although Saint James
has meant everything to me...

01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:18.610
although
it's been my whole life...

01:34:21.209 --> 01:34:24.475
I would gladly give all
of that up for this.

01:34:26.777 --> 01:34:28.075
For you.

01:34:31.476 --> 01:34:35.473
So I am withdrawing my
lawsuit against the school

01:34:35.475 --> 01:34:38.740
and dropping the charges
against Adam Richertson.

01:34:38.742 --> 01:34:42.473
I've also agreed to turn this
land over to Hadleigh University

01:34:42.475 --> 01:34:45.874
so that they can use it
to build a new student center,

01:34:45.876 --> 01:34:47.874
a long overdue addition
to this campus.

01:34:47.876 --> 01:34:49.874
Chancellor Ellsworth
has assured me

01:34:49.876 --> 01:34:53.205
that this new facility will have
a space for our Harbor House,

01:34:53.207 --> 01:34:57.739
led by our campus minister,
Josh Wheaton.

01:34:57.741 --> 01:34:59.342
As for me...

01:35:01.208 --> 01:35:03.606
I'm going to build
a new church.

01:35:03.608 --> 01:35:07.372
And I don't know how,
I don't know where yet,

01:35:07.374 --> 01:35:10.107
but I'm willing to bet that
God can handle the details.

01:35:11.141 --> 01:35:14.739
And I'd love your help.
All of you.

01:35:14.741 --> 01:35:18.341
We can build something new
together.

01:35:19.374 --> 01:35:23.241
But for now, please,
put down those signs.

01:35:24.473 --> 01:35:26.340
Put 'em down.

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:29.541
Please.

01:35:32.607 --> 01:35:34.473
Go ahead, lay them down.

01:35:35.407 --> 01:35:36.340
Put 'em down.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.407
Everyone.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.073
Let's stop shouting at each
other and start listening.

01:35:52.339 --> 01:35:54.871
It's the only way
that things will get better.

01:35:54.873 --> 01:35:58.206
Now, please,
take these candles...

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.606
and let's stand together.

01:36:46.772 --> 01:36:48.203
Thank you.

01:36:59.470 --> 01:37:01.869
Let this candle represent

01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:07.203
peace, hope... and unity.

01:37:12.336 --> 01:37:13.404
And love.

01:37:25.469 --> 01:37:28.336
<i>Sometimes
all it takes is a spark.</i>

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.336
<i>Something very small.</i>

01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:35.603
<i>But the spark becomes a flame.</i>

01:37:37.336 --> 01:37:40.200
<i>And if that flame spreads,</i>

01:37:40.202 --> 01:37:44.236
<i>the power can be so overwhelming it
transforms everything around it.</i>

01:37:55.602 --> 01:37:57.733
<i>The divisive
pastor at the center</i>

01:37:57.735 --> 01:37:59.867
<i>of weeks
of vehement protest</i>

01:37:59.869 --> 01:38:05.133
<i>has suddenly become a symbol of
forgiveness and unity in Hope Springs.</i>

01:38:05.135 --> 01:38:07.466
<i>And what was once
a city divided</i>

01:38:07.468 --> 01:38:10.867
<i>is now a community
coming together to heal.</i>

01:38:10.869 --> 01:38:14.667
<i>You can't be taken seriously as a leader
if you roll over for your enemies.</i>

01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:16.899
<i>No, I don't think that
Reverend Hill rolled over.</i>

01:38:16.901 --> 01:38:20.899
<i>I think that he saw people suffering
and he made a sacrifice for them.</i>

01:38:20.901 --> 01:38:24.198
<i>Surely, the parallels to
Christianity are not lost on you.</i>

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.667
<i>So, I mean, call it a
publicity stunt if you want,</i>

01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:29.232
<i>but we were there.</i>

01:38:29.234 --> 01:38:30.599
<i>I mean, this dude's legit.</i>

01:38:30.601 --> 01:38:32.366
He would have won.

01:38:32.368 --> 01:38:35.499
He could have given Hadleigh the
finger, but he handed it back.

01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:38.465
<i>He cares more about this community
than winning. I believe that.</i>

01:38:38.467 --> 01:38:42.631
<i>Perhaps the rest of the country
can take a page from this book.</i>

01:38:42.633 --> 01:38:45.500
- Your two o'clock is here.
- Send her in, Charlotte.

01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:48.464
Hey. Let me guess.

01:38:48.466 --> 01:38:50.732
You're probably on
another phone interview.

01:38:50.734 --> 01:38:53.197
Listen, if you're going to do
the media circuit thing,

01:38:53.199 --> 01:38:55.332
why don't you get
a big-boy haircut,

01:38:55.334 --> 01:38:57.400
get Meg to take you
clothes shopping.

01:38:58.633 --> 01:39:01.464
Um, give me a call when you
get your head above water.

01:39:01.466 --> 01:39:05.333
I want to hear about the
plans for the new digs.

01:39:07.733 --> 01:39:09.465
I'm proud of you,
little brother.

01:39:10.867 --> 01:39:12.400
Take care, David.

01:39:29.766 --> 01:39:32.198
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:39:47.599 --> 01:39:49.730
Congratulations.

01:39:49.732 --> 01:39:51.229
I think you're
gonna love it here.

01:39:51.231 --> 01:39:52.599
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:55.064
Good stuff.

01:39:57.231 --> 01:39:58.896
You know what I was thinking?

01:39:58.898 --> 01:40:00.596
What's that?

01:40:00.598 --> 01:40:02.197
Jude was right.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:04.531
God is good.

01:40:06.197 --> 01:40:07.497
All the time.

01:40:09.131 --> 01:40:10.498
And all the time...

01:40:12.364 --> 01:40:13.598
God is good.

01:40:17.864 --> 01:40:20.064
<i>I can hear you again.</i>

01:40:21.197 --> 01:40:24.597
<i>And even though I know
you were never really gone...</i>

01:40:28.130 --> 01:40:30.063
<i>it's good to have you back.</i>

01:41:49.861 --> 01:41:52.525
<i>Hallelujah! Whoo!</i>

The healing that happened here
can happen anywhere.

01:44:20.122 --> 01:44:22.453
I'm Michael Tait
of the Newsboys.

01:44:22.455 --> 01:44:24.587
The cure to
what plagues our world

01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:27.452
isn't more division
or finger-pointing.

01:44:27.454 --> 01:44:31.854
It's hope and unity and letting
Christ's love shine through us.

01:44:31.856 --> 01:44:34.185
The beauty
of the human race

01:44:34.187 --> 01:44:37.520
is found in the diversity
of the human race.

01:44:37.522 --> 01:44:39.486
Let's celebrate this.

01:44:39.488 --> 01:44:41.853
Since the very first
<i>God's Not Dead</i> movie,

01:44:41.855 --> 01:44:44.352
we set out to inspire
a movement to show

01:44:44.354 --> 01:44:47.886
God is alive
and still working today.

01:44:47.888 --> 01:44:51.387
It's not easy to see in a world
of division and anger and pain,

01:44:51.389 --> 01:44:54.853
but God remains good
all the time.

01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:57.319
We just need to
show it through our words,

01:44:57.321 --> 01:44:59.852
our actions, and our love.

01:44:59.854 --> 01:45:03.585
It's our chance to be
a light in darkness.

01:45:03.587 --> 01:45:05.119
So let's start right now.

01:45:05.121 --> 01:45:06.485
As you leave the theaters,

01:45:06.487 --> 01:45:09.451
share a message
of integrity and unity

01:45:09.453 --> 01:45:12.718
with your family and friends
on social media

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:15.385
with the #GodsNotDead

01:45:15.387 --> 01:45:18.119
and by downloading
the "God's Not Dead" app.

01:45:18.121 --> 01:45:20.652
Together, we can create
a wave of hope

01:45:20.654 --> 01:45:22.652
and inspiration online.

01:45:22.654 --> 01:45:26.218
Our world desperately
needs to see the light.

01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.484
Let's share it.
Let's be it.

01:45:28.486 --> 01:45:30.053
God bless you.
