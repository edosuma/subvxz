00:05.538 --> 00:07.870
Welcome to LuthorCorp.

00:08.039 --> 00:12.374
Now, you're all here
to learn something about business.

00:12.645 --> 00:16.308
The most important element
in anything to do with economic theory...

00:16.482 --> 00:17.949
...is the individual.

00:18.551 --> 00:19.882
Yes...

00:20.052 --> 00:21.644
...you.

00:22.822 --> 00:26.417
Traditional rules, supply and demand,
they're secondary...

00:26.726 --> 00:30.025
...but to rise above those rules,
to know when to break them...

00:30.196 --> 00:33.632
...requires absolute personal commitment.

00:33.833 --> 00:37.894
I consider it a prerequisite for success.

00:40.439 --> 00:43.897
And I consider it despicable,
immoral and possibly illegal.

00:44.076 --> 00:46.567
I'm sorry. Do you have a question?

00:47.980 --> 00:51.108
No? Anybody else?

00:51.283 --> 00:55.845
No? All right, then, I'll hand you
back over to Mr. Simms.

00:56.021 --> 00:58.216
All right, group, follow me.

00:58.390 --> 01:01.086
-lt was a pleasure meeting you.
-Thank you.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.125
Miss Sullivan, Mr. Kent.

01:03.295 --> 01:07.493
Well, it's nice to see you both
looking to the future.

01:11.270 --> 01:13.636
Want to make a break for the fire escape?

01:13.806 --> 01:18.539
I'd crawl down all 39 stories if this field trip
didn't count toward our final grade.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.702
Welcome to the Lionel Luthor eXhibit.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.849
Next floor: victims, sycophants
and hatchet men.

01:24.016 --> 01:26.814
How about I split up
this jaded little fan club?

01:26.986 --> 01:29.853
Mr. Kent, take the neXt car.

Elevators.

01:47.239 --> 01:50.367
Too much demand, not enough supply.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.169
Oh, my God.

02:55.274 --> 02:56.707
What did you just do?

02:57.142 --> 02:59.940
Please, don't tell anyone about this.

03:01.647 --> 03:04.047
Hello! Hello! Is anybody in there?

03:04.216 --> 03:06.741
This is LuthorCorp security.
Remain calm.

03:08.654 --> 03:11.418
If anybody's in there,
we're working to get you out!

03:11.657 --> 03:13.284
Hang on!

03:25.804 --> 03:28.204
What did you just do?

03:29.041 --> 03:32.636
You didn't want to get caught,
and I wanted to help, so....

03:36.148 --> 03:40.084
Clark, now you know my secret too.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.887
You can't tell anybody.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.489
-Please.
-Are you two all right?

03:49.261 --> 03:51.195
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

03:51.363 --> 03:54.662
The elevator crashed
just as we got out of the doors.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.264
-Sounded like the cable broke.
-How?

03:57.903 --> 03:59.632
I don't know, Chloe.

03:59.805 --> 04:01.796
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.299
Thank you.

05:08.841 --> 05:11.674
Alicia, hold on!

05:11.844 --> 05:14.312
I didn't get a chance
to thank you yesterday.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.278
Oh, it was my pleasure.

05:17.449 --> 05:22.477
It was actually kind of a relief to be able
to share my ability with someone.

05:24.189 --> 05:26.885
Is that what it takes
to be friends with you?

05:28.027 --> 05:30.291
I guess I deserved that.

05:30.462 --> 05:33.829
I'm not really as stuck-up
as everyone thinks.

05:35.267 --> 05:38.430
What, you think I don't know
what people say about me?

05:39.872 --> 05:42.272
It doesn't bother you, huh?

05:42.541 --> 05:45.203
I'm always so afraid that if I get
too close to people...

05:45.377 --> 05:49.336
...they'll find out about me,
realize that I'm a freak.

05:49.515 --> 05:54.919
I just figure it's better to be alone,
even if people think I'm a snob.

05:55.421 --> 05:59.721
You don't mind if I ask....
Have you always been able to...?

06:00.759 --> 06:03.489
No. It was the meteor shower.

06:03.662 --> 06:07.826
One minute I was swinging on the swing set,
next I'm in the middle of a corn field.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.592
Do you know how it happened?

06:09.768 --> 06:13.602
Sort of. I mean, once I was old enough
to realize I was different...

06:13.772 --> 06:17.833
...I did some research and--
Thank you.

06:19.678 --> 06:24.274
I don't know. There's a complicated
explanation about quantum physics.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.544
-You'd probably be bored.
-No.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.957
Try me.

06:33.592 --> 06:38.291
Basically, the meteor shower
affected my body...

06:38.464 --> 06:41.592
...and allowed me to teleport myself.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.834
And anything you touch.

06:44.837 --> 06:48.500
And anything I touch
I want to take with me. Yes.

06:54.279 --> 06:58.113
What about you?
Was it meteor eXposure too?

06:59.952 --> 07:03.479
Everything's pretty much connected
to the meteor shower.

07:03.655 --> 07:05.122
Right?

07:05.924 --> 07:07.448
Right.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.522
I just can't believe you're like me.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.725
I mean, not eXactly like me, but just...

07:19.738 --> 07:21.433
...Iike me.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.631
You know?

07:24.042 --> 07:26.670
Yeah. I do.

07:30.315 --> 07:31.782
Bye.

07:40.492 --> 07:42.551
Adam?

08:22.367 --> 08:24.597
Lana.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.262
What are you doing?

08:28.240 --> 08:31.232
-Adam, what is this?
-It's private. Give it back to me.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.067
No.

08:33.578 --> 08:37.606
"January 1 1 th. Lana evasive
about her relationship with Clark.

08:38.116 --> 08:41.745
January 1 7th. Clark is at the scene
of another accident."

08:42.087 --> 08:46.251
You've been spying on me,
and you've been spying on Clark.

08:46.425 --> 08:47.892
Look who's talking.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.156
No, you threatened me, and now I find out
you've been keeping tabs on me?

08:52.331 --> 08:54.492
I want you to leave.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.140
Guess you haven't checked tenant laws.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.413
It's not that easy to evict someone.

09:11.149 --> 09:13.242
I'm not going anywhere.

09:27.299 --> 09:29.529
Alicia.

09:30.068 --> 09:31.467
Hey.

09:31.703 --> 09:33.568
I've been looking all over for you.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.299
Yeah, you figured teleporting girl,
physics lab.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.740
It makes sense.
That's a pretty good deduction.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.805
But I should warn you, Clark,
I'm not always that easy to pin down.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.644
So I've seen.

09:50.622 --> 09:52.817
But since I've been this lucky...

09:53.025 --> 09:55.391
...I was just wondering if you'd like...

09:55.927 --> 09:58.828
...to get together,
you know, for the econ test.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.365
Are you asking me out on a date?

10:03.969 --> 10:06.369
A date? No.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.735
Not that I wouldn't, but....

10:09.908 --> 10:11.773
Clark...

10:12.811 --> 10:15.371
...would you like to go out
on a date with me?

10:29.061 --> 10:30.653
Did you just win the lotto?

10:31.063 --> 10:32.325
What?

10:32.631 --> 10:37.193
No, it's just-- I haven't seen you
smile like that in a long time.

10:40.038 --> 10:42.370
Look, l-- I don't want to spoil your mood...

10:42.541 --> 10:45.601
...but I wanted to tell you
something about Adam.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.842
What is it?

10:49.648 --> 10:52.583
He's been keeping a journal about me.

10:53.018 --> 10:57.955
And you. And I don't know if it's because
he's jealous or he's obsessed with us...

10:58.123 --> 10:59.886
...or if....

11:00.058 --> 11:02.026
If it's more about you.

11:02.728 --> 11:06.289
-Well, I'll go talk to him.
-Clark, no, I'm gonna have him evicted.

11:06.465 --> 11:10.196
I don't think he'll bother
either of us anymore. I just...

11:10.369 --> 11:12.496
...wanted to give you a heads up.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.364
See you at 7?

11:20.979 --> 11:22.742
Hey, Lana.

11:27.219 --> 11:29.278
We're in the same econ class.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.401
According to the Greeks...

11:45.570 --> 11:51.600
...Orion the Hunter is greater in strength
and stature than any other mortal.

11:52.210 --> 11:55.111
I thought I was the only one
who knew astronomy.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.747
I'm a science geek.

11:58.850 --> 12:01.080
You don't look like one.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.154
Thanks.

12:07.859 --> 12:12.023
So I spent the whole movie wondering
what else you can do...

12:12.197 --> 12:14.688
...other than punch through steel.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.201
What do you mean?

12:19.571 --> 12:22.438
Come on, Clark.

12:22.607 --> 12:27.306
I know you managed to fry
that security camera. I just....

12:27.479 --> 12:31.210
I can't figure out eXactly how.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.920
With my eyes. They give off heat.

12:40.992 --> 12:43.222
That's incredible.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.128
Have you ever shown Lana
what you can do?

12:51.970 --> 12:52.994
No.

12:55.140 --> 13:00.203
It's actually one of our issues. I didn't feel
I could be completely honest with her.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.037
Like you are with me?

13:08.386 --> 13:10.820
So how about you?

13:10.989 --> 13:13.423
Any boyfriends or...?

13:13.825 --> 13:17.056
There was this boy,
and I really liked him...

13:18.930 --> 13:23.458
...but then he found out what I can do,
and he totally freaked.

13:27.372 --> 13:29.306
What he thought...

13:30.141 --> 13:31.608
...doesn't matter.

14:00.839 --> 14:04.240
Looks like someone stayed up.
I hope they didn't worry.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.338
Yeah, my parents are a little...

14:06.511 --> 14:08.001
...overprotective.

14:08.179 --> 14:09.441
Really?

14:09.614 --> 14:14.142
Yeah, they don't really understand
everything about my abilities.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.648
For a while, they tried
to keep me from doing it.

14:18.823 --> 14:20.620
How?

14:24.296 --> 14:26.491
I don't really want to talk about it.

14:26.665 --> 14:27.962
Okay.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.599
What about your parents?

14:32.304 --> 14:33.794
My parents are great.

14:33.972 --> 14:38.272
They worry about me, that someone might
find out, but they don't try to change me.

14:41.179 --> 14:43.807
Well, maybe that's why you're so special.

14:47.252 --> 14:48.913
Clark...

14:50.188 --> 14:53.021
...I just want you to know...

14:53.191 --> 14:55.751
...that I had a really good time tonight.

14:55.927 --> 14:57.189
Me too.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.859
Yeah.

15:17.148 --> 15:19.139
Okay.

15:24.255 --> 15:25.984
I guess....

15:26.157 --> 15:27.988
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

15:28.159 --> 15:29.854
Okay.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.179
Alicia.

16:27.352 --> 16:30.753
Sorry. I didn't want to scare you. I just...

16:30.922 --> 16:34.517
-...wanted to surprise you.
-What are you doing here?

16:34.693 --> 16:38.720
When you dropped me off, I could tell
that you didn't want the night to end...

16:40.198 --> 16:42.632
...and neither did l, so....

16:48.840 --> 16:50.307
Alicia, l....

16:50.875 --> 16:53.901
I know you wanted to kiss me, Clark.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.877
-Alicia....
-Just kiss me.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.006
Hey, what'd you do, fall out of--?

17:31.950 --> 17:33.440
Dad.

17:40.458 --> 17:43.791
I don't know, Martha, it's what we've
always discussed. We have rules...

17:43.962 --> 17:46.453
...boundaries, limitations.

17:46.631 --> 17:49.191
Clark knows that. I don't understand--

17:49.367 --> 17:51.631
Jonathan.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.339
She's gone.

17:55.507 --> 17:58.305
What did she do, Clark,
climb out the window?

17:58.777 --> 18:00.836
Actually, she teleported out.

18:01.012 --> 18:04.140
You're gonna have to run that
by me one more time.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.619
Alicia was infected by the meteor shower.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.121
She can transport herself
wherever she wants.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.691
Including boys' bedrooms.

18:17.128 --> 18:18.686
Look, Alicia saved me.

18:18.863 --> 18:22.264
We were trapped in the LuthorCorp
elevator, and the cable broke...

18:22.433 --> 18:25.027
...and I had to stop it.

18:26.070 --> 18:28.971
So Alicia saw you use your powers?

18:29.440 --> 18:30.805
Yes.

18:31.509 --> 18:34.478
How much does she know
about you, Clark?

18:35.113 --> 18:37.172
She knows about the strength...

18:43.121 --> 18:45.316
...and the heat vision.

18:46.257 --> 18:50.717
I suppose the next thing you'll tell us is she
knows you get sick around meteor rocks.

18:50.895 --> 18:52.863
No, I didn't tell her that.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.268
She didn't have to help me.

19:00.438 --> 19:03.532
She was willing to expose
her own secret to protect mine...

19:04.142 --> 19:07.236
...and I think that's why I feel
such a connection to her.

19:09.647 --> 19:11.444
Look, you guys don't get this.

19:12.116 --> 19:14.277
We're a lot alike.

19:15.386 --> 19:17.911
You really like this girl,
don't you, honey?

19:18.089 --> 19:19.488
Maybe I do.

19:20.792 --> 19:25.024
I think I found someone I could
actually have a relationship with.

19:30.969 --> 19:35.463
Clark, I know we've had
our differences lately.

19:36.808 --> 19:40.608
-But I can't believe you didn't tell me.
-Tell you what?

19:40.778 --> 19:44.441
That your dad caught you and Alicia
in your bedroom, that's what.

19:45.550 --> 19:49.077
The only people who knew about that
were me, my parents and Alicia.

19:49.821 --> 19:52.847
Well, I guess she's not
as secretive as you are.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.117
Anyway, man, that girl is on fire.

19:55.293 --> 19:57.625
Congratulations.

19:58.029 --> 19:59.758
Later, stud.

19:59.931 --> 20:01.796
Yeah.

20:14.779 --> 20:16.644
Good morning, gorgeous.

20:16.814 --> 20:19.476
Alicia. Look, we need to talk.

20:19.884 --> 20:21.374
What's wrong?

20:21.552 --> 20:25.113
Well, last night in my room,
and these pictures....

20:25.323 --> 20:26.756
Don't you like them?

20:27.725 --> 20:29.989
No, I do. It's just....

20:30.628 --> 20:34.029
I just think we're moving a little too fast.

20:40.204 --> 20:43.367
You said you had a great time last night.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.267
You kissed me.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.845
No....

20:50.081 --> 20:52.743
I did, and I did.

20:54.252 --> 20:58.348
I just think that maybe
we need to set some boundaries...

20:58.523 --> 21:01.048
...you know, maybe some limitations.

21:01.225 --> 21:03.693
We're special, Clark.

21:04.595 --> 21:09.794
People like us don't have
boundaries and limitations.

21:12.136 --> 21:13.865
I'll see you later, sweetie.

21:15.873 --> 21:17.363
Yeah.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.676
I'll be thinking about you.

21:23.247 --> 21:25.442
You go on one date with this girl...

21:25.616 --> 21:28.210
...and already she's sneaking
into your bedroom...

21:28.386 --> 21:31.150
...putting sexy pictures
of herself in your locker...

21:31.322 --> 21:34.553
...practically asking her parents
to book the wedding chapel.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.694
What's your secret, Clark?

21:37.862 --> 21:40.057
This isn't funny, LeX.

21:41.132 --> 21:44.397
We barely know each other.
She's already acting like we're soul mates.

21:44.569 --> 21:48.369
Look, in my experience, a person doesn't
develop this kind of fixation...

21:48.539 --> 21:52.134
...unless she's been led to think
the relationship is more than just casual.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.405
You're saying I led her on.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.672
I'm saying I've been there.

21:59.183 --> 22:03.085
She's smart, she's pretty,
and you want her to like you...

22:03.254 --> 22:05.722
...so you tell her things
she wants to hear.

22:06.624 --> 22:09.923
I'm curious. What exactly did you do
to make her feel this way?

22:15.099 --> 22:17.192
You're making my point for me.

22:25.843 --> 22:27.640
So, what do I do now?

22:36.854 --> 22:39.880
You must be Clark. Come in, come in.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.083
Alicia's not here right now.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.225
Honey.

22:44.762 --> 22:46.992
Look who's here. It's Clark.

22:47.165 --> 22:49.360
Clark.

22:50.401 --> 22:52.699
She's-- She's told us so much about you...

22:52.870 --> 22:57.136
...and, well, we're just thrilled
that's she's dating such a nice young man.

22:57.408 --> 23:02.107
Actually, that's why I'm here.
I think she has the wrong idea about us.

23:02.613 --> 23:07.175
No, I'm pretty sure that you're mistaken.

23:07.351 --> 23:10.445
-She said you're her boyfriend.
-That's the thing. I'm--

23:10.621 --> 23:13.146
No, if she says you're dating...

23:13.324 --> 23:15.315
...well, just go along with it.

23:15.827 --> 23:18.125
Alicia's a special girl.

23:20.131 --> 23:23.589
I know about Alicia. Her ability....

23:25.570 --> 23:28.630
She said you tried to stop her
from using it. How?

23:31.509 --> 23:33.636
We kept her in a special room.

23:33.811 --> 23:36.541
But she begged us to let her out.

23:36.714 --> 23:39.274
She promised she wouldn't
abuse her power.

23:39.450 --> 23:43.045
Now we never know where she is
or what she'll do.

23:43.554 --> 23:47.388
Please, Clark, just try
to go along with her.

23:48.092 --> 23:50.993
If you see Alicia,
please tell her I'm looking for her.

23:52.497 --> 23:53.725
Clark.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.901
There was another boy
that Alicia liked a lot.

24:01.072 --> 24:03.040
It didn't end well.

24:03.808 --> 24:05.639
Be careful.

24:13.484 --> 24:14.917
Alicia.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.479
You shouldn't have said that, Daddy.

24:24.695 --> 24:28.028
I'm sorry to bother you with this,
but I didn't know where else to turn.

24:28.199 --> 24:31.134
It's all right, Lana.
I trust your instincts.

24:31.302 --> 24:35.295
Look, if you're nervous about Adam,
I'm sure it's with good reason.

24:35.673 --> 24:38.005
Is there anything concrete
you can tell me?

24:38.609 --> 24:43.478
No, not really. Just the journal
that I told you about and his attitude.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.915
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

24:48.319 --> 24:49.581
I checked the laws...

24:49.754 --> 24:52.985
...and it can take up
to six months to get him out...

24:53.157 --> 24:55.785
...and I'm not willing to wait that long.

24:55.960 --> 24:59.191
Believe me, there are definitely ways
of getting rid of someone...

24:59.363 --> 25:01.024
...a lot faster than that.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.751
-Hey.
-Alicia.

25:29.627 --> 25:31.595
What's going on?

25:31.762 --> 25:34.788
I got your message.
My parents said you wanted to see me.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.797
So here I am.

25:36.968 --> 25:40.904
Well, that wasn't an invitation
to redecorate or to go through my stuff.

25:41.072 --> 25:44.303
I thought you'd like what I did
to the loft. It's--

25:44.475 --> 25:46.739
It's more us now.

25:48.279 --> 25:49.541
What's this all about?

25:49.747 --> 25:52.648
Clark, it's time to move on.

25:52.817 --> 25:56.480
I know you used to go out with Lana,
but now you're with me.

25:58.055 --> 25:59.852
There's no us.

26:00.024 --> 26:02.288
Of course there is.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.057
We're special.

26:04.629 --> 26:06.756
We're made for each other.

26:07.064 --> 26:09.897
You didn't tell Lana your secret.
You told me.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.198
You and I are meant to be together.

26:26.717 --> 26:27.843
Hello.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.810
Yes.

26:34.091 --> 26:35.524
It's my father.

26:36.527 --> 26:38.290
He's at the hospital.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.421
He fell down the stairs.

26:58.215 --> 26:59.910
Miss Baker...

27:00.651 --> 27:02.380
...may I have a word?

27:05.256 --> 27:07.156
What is it?

27:07.792 --> 27:11.728
Can you think of anyone
who would want to hurt your father?

27:13.364 --> 27:14.956
I thought it was an accident.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.998
There was a suspicious-looking
blunt trauma...

27:19.170 --> 27:21.866
...to the back of Mr. Baker's head.

27:22.406 --> 27:24.670
It's possible there was an assailant.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.172
Possible?

27:27.745 --> 27:30.043
The basement was locked from the inside.

27:33.951 --> 27:35.213
I'm sorry.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.515
It's fine.

27:45.463 --> 27:48.057
Alicia, listen to me.

27:48.232 --> 27:50.860
I need to know. Did you have
anything to do with this?

27:51.035 --> 27:53.833
How could you think that?

27:54.004 --> 27:56.700
Who else could escape
from a locked basement?

28:06.851 --> 28:09.149
I did it for us.

28:11.756 --> 28:14.054
He was trying to keep us apart.

28:16.927 --> 28:18.622
You need to talk to the sheriff.

28:19.230 --> 28:20.925
No.

28:36.113 --> 28:38.547
Clark. Hi.

28:39.483 --> 28:42.577
I stopped by to see you, and your mom
asked me to stay for dinner.

28:45.322 --> 28:46.949
What are you doing here?

28:47.124 --> 28:49.524
I'm just getting to know your family.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.388
You need to turn yourself in.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.829
You're my boyfriend.

28:53.998 --> 28:57.957
You're supposed to be protecting me.
Like I protected you.

29:01.305 --> 29:05.241
As long as you do that,
your secret's safe.

29:05.943 --> 29:09.470
-And so are the people you care about.
-ls that a threat?

29:15.686 --> 29:18.416
Tell your mom I'm sorry I couldn't stay.

29:23.194 --> 29:25.890
I'm really sorry she
went all Glenn Close on you.

29:26.063 --> 29:30.295
I should've told you about Alicia's ability
before, but she asked me to keep it secret.

29:30.501 --> 29:33.265
Yeah, and I respect you
for keeping her confidence...

29:33.437 --> 29:36.895
...but once she went psycho,
all bets are off.

29:38.442 --> 29:42.742
So how do you look for someone
who can disappear in the blink of an eye?

29:43.848 --> 29:45.281
Well...

29:46.550 --> 29:49.781
...we know that Alicia has
at least one weakness.

29:51.088 --> 29:52.521
You.

29:55.826 --> 29:57.919
She may have one more.

29:58.095 --> 30:00.290
Chloe, I have an idea.

30:00.631 --> 30:02.360
I'm gonna need your help.

30:04.802 --> 30:08.829
Mrs. Baker? I'm Chloe Sullivan.
I need to speak with Alicia, please.

30:09.006 --> 30:11.736
-It's urgent.
-What's wrong?

30:11.942 --> 30:14.843
It's her boyfriend, Clark. He's in trouble.

30:15.746 --> 30:17.646
What do you mean?

30:23.754 --> 30:25.187
What is it?

30:25.523 --> 30:29.391
Sheriff Adams suspects he may have had
something to do with your father's accident.

30:30.227 --> 30:32.661
-Alicia--
-Mother.

30:44.909 --> 30:46.900
Why would the sheriff suspect Clark?

30:47.478 --> 30:50.242
She has this theory that Clark was angry
with your father...

30:50.414 --> 30:52.575
...for not allowing you guys
to be together.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.183
Is he under arrest?

30:54.552 --> 30:56.315
No, he's in hiding.

30:56.487 --> 30:59.081
He asked me to find you
and tell you he needs help.

30:59.256 --> 31:01.622
I don't understand why...

31:01.792 --> 31:04.454
...but he said you were his only chance.

31:10.367 --> 31:12.392
Where is he now?

31:21.111 --> 31:22.942
Clark?

31:27.318 --> 31:29.183
Clark?

31:42.199 --> 31:43.461
Alicia?

31:45.336 --> 31:47.463
Clark, are you okay?

31:47.638 --> 31:51.096
They're after me. The sheriff thinks
I tried to kill your father.

31:51.508 --> 31:53.135
I know.

31:54.144 --> 31:58.046
-You have to tell them the truth.
-No, I can't do that.

31:59.283 --> 32:00.750
Alicia....

32:01.719 --> 32:03.448
-We'll disappear.
-What?

32:03.621 --> 32:05.987
We'll go somewhere
where no one will find us.

32:12.796 --> 32:16.027
Yeah. I guess that's the only way.

32:19.770 --> 32:21.203
Come on.

32:29.647 --> 32:32.343
Quick, someone's coming. Come on.

32:47.264 --> 32:49.255
Lead paint?

32:51.268 --> 32:53.600
Are you trying to trap me...

32:54.805 --> 32:58.002
...Iike my parents did, in that little room?

32:58.175 --> 33:00.700
Alicia, what you did
to your father was wrong.

33:01.278 --> 33:04.645
You're just trying to get me out
of the way so you can be with Lana.

33:04.848 --> 33:07.043
Alicia, you need help.

33:07.217 --> 33:09.947
Don't you understand?

33:11.488 --> 33:14.048
I'm the one that's right for you.

33:14.224 --> 33:16.055
No, I'm sorry.

33:16.627 --> 33:18.754
The police are already on their way.

33:19.663 --> 33:21.995
Just because I can't teleport
out of this room...

33:22.166 --> 33:24.396
...doesn't mean that I can't walk out.

33:34.678 --> 33:37.374
I overheard you talking to your parents.

33:37.548 --> 33:41.780
I hoped that I wouldn't have to use it,
but you broke the rules first.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.682
Please.

33:44.855 --> 33:47.255
Alicia, don't do this.

33:49.359 --> 33:51.350
Come here.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.460
Once Lana's out of the way...

33:55.632 --> 33:58.829
...you'll realize we
were meant to be together.

34:05.576 --> 34:08.476
We can still be great together, Clark.

34:08.645 --> 34:12.603
We're soul mates,
and nothing can stop that.

34:22.391 --> 34:24.621
What is it about you, Lana?

34:24.795 --> 34:26.284
EXcuse me?

34:26.463 --> 34:29.830
What is it that Clark Kent is so in love with?

34:30.400 --> 34:33.460
I mean, what have you got
that I haven't got?

34:34.071 --> 34:37.040
I have no idea what you're talking about.

34:42.713 --> 34:44.737
I think you do.

34:59.296 --> 35:01.628
Tell me, Lana.

35:02.766 --> 35:04.893
What's your secret?

35:07.971 --> 35:10.997
You're not prettier than I am.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.873
And you're definitely not smarter.

35:21.351 --> 35:25.185
And you certainly
don't have my abilities.

35:25.756 --> 35:29.317
Alicia, there is nothing going on
between me and Clark.

35:32.863 --> 35:34.694
Oh, yes, there is...

35:34.865 --> 35:38.392
...because Clark is still in love with you.

35:39.469 --> 35:41.596
But now it's my turn.

35:42.139 --> 35:46.906
He told me the truth about himself.

35:48.612 --> 35:50.876
The things that he wouldn't tell you.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.115
And now you'll never know.

36:35.058 --> 36:37.117
Alicia!

37:14.698 --> 37:17.292
Lana. Lana.

37:17.601 --> 37:18.966
Clark.

37:21.004 --> 37:22.995
Why, Clark?

37:23.173 --> 37:25.004
Why?

37:33.083 --> 37:35.483
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:36.086 --> 37:39.146
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, come on in.

37:39.990 --> 37:43.016
I just wanted to thank you.

37:45.996 --> 37:48.590
You know, I think I should apologize.

37:48.765 --> 37:53.828
-lf I never got involved with Alicia--
-Alicia said that you....

37:54.004 --> 37:56.529
You told her the truth about yourself.

37:58.475 --> 38:01.035
Stuff you never told me.

38:02.179 --> 38:03.806
What did she mean by that?

38:06.550 --> 38:08.984
You know, Alicia said
a lot of crazy things.

38:09.987 --> 38:14.617
She also said that you
were still in love with me.

38:15.525 --> 38:19.655
But that was crazy too, right?

38:22.766 --> 38:24.233
Right.

38:27.704 --> 38:29.433
Lana, hi.

38:31.942 --> 38:33.773
Would you like to stay for dinner?

38:34.411 --> 38:37.175
Thanks, Mrs. Kent, but....

38:39.416 --> 38:41.281
But I can't.

38:42.786 --> 38:45.380
-Well, bye.
-Bye.

38:53.964 --> 38:59.027
Clark, honey, someday, you'll find
the person who's right for you.

39:04.775 --> 39:09.269
For a while, I thought that person was Lana,
but I could never be honest with her.

39:09.446 --> 39:12.244
And then I thought it was Alicia
because she was like me--

39:12.416 --> 39:16.750
Sweetheart, there's nobody
like you. You're....

39:21.725 --> 39:24.319
Maybe that means I'll always be alone.

39:34.237 --> 39:37.138
Hello? Adam?

39:42.112 --> 39:44.273
Lana.

39:46.716 --> 39:48.843
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.987
They told me you were up here.

39:51.154 --> 39:54.954
Lex, thank you. I feel like
this huge burden's been lifted.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.786
What do you mean?

39:56.960 --> 39:58.757
Well, Adam's gone.

39:58.929 --> 40:01.397
I really appreciate your help.

40:01.565 --> 40:05.558
Lana, as much as I'd like to take credit
for getting him out of your life...

40:05.735 --> 40:07.430
...I can't.

40:07.671 --> 40:11.072
My security people haven't been able
to track him down.

40:11.241 --> 40:14.733
Well, if you didn't get rid of him,
then where is he?

40:30.594 --> 40:32.221
Adam.

40:33.430 --> 40:35.330
Hello?

40:35.966 --> 40:38.560
Why did I send you to Smallville?

40:40.370 --> 40:43.032
To become the best friend of Lana Lang.
