CEDRIC: Oh, I think I finally

01:01.362 --> 01:04.096
Cardium constructo!

01:05.231 --> 01:06.832
SOFIA: Mr. Cedric!

01:06.834 --> 01:09.068
Oh, Merlin's mushrooms!

01:09.070 --> 01:11.503
That's just what
I came to see you about.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.272
I won a contest
at school,

01:13.274 --> 01:15.240
and I've been invited
to meet Merlin.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.743
( shrieks )
"The great wizard Merlin

01:17.745 --> 01:20.679
invites you,
Princess Sofia of Enchancia,

01:20.681 --> 01:23.449
to visit him in his legendary
tower of Dragonhold

01:23.451 --> 01:25.584
this afternoon."

01:25.586 --> 01:28.287
Do you realize
what an honor this is?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.189
There's more.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.791
"You may bring
up to two guests
along with you."

01:32.793 --> 01:34.693
I know Merlin
is your hero,

01:34.695 --> 01:37.629
so I couldn't think of
anyone I'd rather invite
than you.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.098
Thank you, princess.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.133
This is like
a dream come true.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.302
I am finally going
to meet my idol,

01:43.304 --> 01:46.105
the one and only
Merlin!

01:46.107 --> 01:48.874
This is going to be
the best day of my life!

01:48.876 --> 01:50.976
- ( knocking on door )
- Here we are.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.312
Oh, no, I forgot about...

01:53.314 --> 01:55.647
Cordelia the Conjurer.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.716
Uncle Ceddy!

01:57.718 --> 01:59.785
Oh, you must be
Princess Sofia.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.220
Hello.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.822
My brother has told me
so much about you.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.557
You're Mr. Cedric's
sister?

02:05.559 --> 02:08.160
Indeed, and this
darling creature

02:08.162 --> 02:10.762
is my daughter Calista.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.898
Hi, Calista.
I'm Sofia.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.600
I'm a friend of
your Uncle Cedric's.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.068
Any friend
of Uncle Ceddy's

02:16.070 --> 02:19.071
is the bestest
best friend of mine.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.740
Wow! You look
just like Mr. Cedric.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.642
Don't I?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.978
I asked Mummy to make
my hair look just like his.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.248
Oh, I missed you
so much, Uncle Ceddy.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.016
Yes, well,
me, too.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.118
Thank you so much
for volunteering

02:33.120 --> 02:35.521
to watch Calista
today, Cedric.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.822
Yes, about that,
Cordelia...

02:36.824 --> 02:39.191
I am only in Enchancia
for a few days,

02:39.193 --> 02:41.593
and I'm determined
to make the most of it.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.262
Shopping at Spells
Fifth Avenue,

02:43.264 --> 02:45.130
lunch at the
all-you-can-conjure buffet.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.332
Oh, and I'm having
an enchanted pedicure at 2:00.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.935
Yes, but I'm afraid that
something's come up...

02:49.937 --> 02:53.138
- What? No!
- Then you understand?

02:53.140 --> 02:56.341
I've scheduled a fairy-dust
facial for 2:00 as well.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.043
I'm double-booked.

02:58.045 --> 03:01.146
I'll just have to
move it to 3:00.
There.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.616
Cedric, you're such a dear
for doing this.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.884
But...

03:05.886 --> 03:07.152
Now I'll be back
at sundown

03:07.154 --> 03:10.355
to pick up
my little angel face.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.324
You mind your
Uncle Cedric, Calista,

03:12.326 --> 03:15.127
- and behave.
- Yes, Mummy.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.529
Toodles!

03:17.531 --> 03:21.133
Oh, I can never get
a word in edgewise with her.

03:21.135 --> 03:23.969
Now I can't go with you
to meet Merlin.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.238
The invitation says I can
bring two guests.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.140
Why don't we just
take Calista with us?

03:28.142 --> 03:30.042
Oh. Well, I suppose
we could.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.810
( knocking
at door )

03:31.812 --> 03:34.680
Oh, Calista sweetheart.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.149
You've taken Mummy's planner
again, haven't you?

03:37.151 --> 03:41.253
But, Mummy, the cover
is just so reddishly red.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.055
It matches
my red robes.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.824
I know you love
red, darling,

03:45.826 --> 03:47.659
but I've got
a busy day ahead,

03:47.661 --> 03:49.361
and I'm going to
be needing that.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.230
Yes, Mummy.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.600
It's just a little phase
Calista's going through.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.168
She's been
taking things.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.536
I'm sure she'll
grow out of it

03:57.538 --> 03:59.204
before too long.

03:59.206 --> 04:00.205
Toodles again.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.507
Oh, dragon drums.

04:02.509 --> 04:05.510
Ooh! What's that,
Sofia?

04:05.512 --> 04:06.778
Pretty red lettering.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.047
Calista, give that back.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.683
We're going to need
that invitation
to see Merlin.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.218
Would you like to
come with us?

04:13.220 --> 04:14.853
Is Uncle Ceddy coming?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.855
- Yep.
- Then I'm coming, too.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.259
I want to go everywhere
my favorite uncle goes!

04:20.261 --> 04:22.060
She can't come along.

04:22.062 --> 04:25.030
What if she keeps
doing what she's doing?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.565
I'll keep an eye
on Calista.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.233
It'll be fine.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.435
Oh, I do hope
you're right.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.075
Dragonhold,

04:37.077 --> 04:39.778
the legendary tower
of Merlin.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.216
Oh!

04:44.218 --> 04:46.885
Let's go in.
There's lots of stuff
to play with here.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.988
Hmm.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.990
Nobody's home.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.494
Aren't you handsome?

04:55.496 --> 04:57.229
It's a magic mirror.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.997
It's not
a magic mirror.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.833
It's just got
a wizard in it.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.834
Merlin!

05:02.836 --> 05:04.636
In person.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.638
Please forgive
my little trick.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.607
I was just practicing
a new spell

05:08.609 --> 05:11.576
that can put
a person inside a mirror.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.145
All you need
is some water

05:13.147 --> 05:14.446
from a reflecting pool,

05:14.448 --> 05:16.248
and a shiny
silver bowl.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.685
Reflecting pool water,
silver bowl. Wonderful!

05:19.687 --> 05:21.753
I'm Princess Sofia
of Enchancia,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.789
and this is
our royal sorcerer Cedric,

05:23.791 --> 05:25.290
and his niece Calista.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.591
I won the contest.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.760
Welcome,
one and all.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.863
This is such an honor,
Mr. Merlin, sir.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.999
I am your figgest ban...

05:34.001 --> 05:35.801
I mean your biggest fan.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.836
Merlin's mushrooms.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.805
Oh, would you like
to try some?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.541
Fungus amongus.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.444
They are quite tasty,
if I do say so myself.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.648
Ooh!

05:49.650 --> 05:52.784
It's not often
I have guests.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.686
Excuse me a moment
while I tidy up

05:54.688 --> 05:56.788
the place a bit.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.690
Spickandspanio!

06:03.129 --> 06:04.696
So pretty.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.800
Wait. Come back here.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.870
Gotcha!

06:11.872 --> 06:14.172
( gasps )
Calista!

06:14.174 --> 06:15.674
I love red hats.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.309
That one belongs
to Merlin.

06:17.311 --> 06:20.011
I know.
Put it back.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.480
If I must.

06:26.319 --> 06:30.021
So let's get
this visit started, shall we?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.424
I'll give you
the grand tour of my tower.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.226
There's so much to see,

06:34.228 --> 06:37.162
I'm not sure
I've seen everything,
and I live here.

06:37.164 --> 06:42.000

ladies and sorcerers.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.102
There's much more
to show you.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.073
Thanks for a great day,
Mr. Merlin.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.909
Safe travels,
my friends.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.744
Do come again
sometime.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.245
CEDRIC:
Farewell, Merlin.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.514
- CALISTA: Toodle-oo.
- SOFIA: Bye!

09:09.516 --> 09:10.916
Well, that was
really fun.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.751
Is that all
you can say

09:12.753 --> 09:16.087
about meeting the most
amazing wizard in the world?

09:16.089 --> 09:19.357
You're the most amazing
wizard, Uncle Ceddy.

09:19.359 --> 09:23.895
Yes, well, meeting Merlin
was a dream come true for me.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.165
He even gave me
this autographed picture.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.067
Can you believe it?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.271
( giggling )

09:33.273 --> 09:34.539
I got something, too.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.275
BOTH: The dragon claw wand?!

09:37.277 --> 09:39.511
Yes. Don't you love
how red it is?

09:39.513 --> 09:42.614
Calista, you can't just take
the most powerful wand

09:42.616 --> 09:45.116
of the greatest wizard
in the world.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.451
You have to
give it back.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.786
Right away.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.855
- But I like it.
- I like it, too.

09:50.857 --> 09:54.092
It's Morgana,
the evil enchantress.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.794
Merlin's enemy.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.562
Arch enemy.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.432
It has a better
ring to it,
don't you think?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.033
Hey!

10:02.035 --> 10:06.037
At last I have my hands on
Merlin's dragon claw wand.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.742
With this, I can finally defeat
that do-gooding old wizard.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.378
Give that back.
It's not yours.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.047
That didn't seem
to stop you from taking it.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.217
I could never get into
Merlin's tower,

10:19.219 --> 10:22.153
so I never had a chance
to grab his dragon claw wand.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.623
But you brought it
right to me.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.057
Let's try it out,
shall we?

10:31.130 --> 10:34.766
Oh, that crafty conjurer's
locked it with a charm.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.434
So only
he can use it.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.403
You're no match
for Merlin.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.072
Then I'll just take this wand
back to my fortress,

10:41.074 --> 10:43.141
and figure out
how to unlock it.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.478
Then I'll be able to use
Merlin's own dragon claw wand

10:46.480 --> 10:48.413
to defeat him.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.049
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.253
Mercury's meatballs!

10:55.255 --> 10:57.489
Mirror, mirror
in my hand,

10:57.491 --> 10:59.924
who is the baddest
in the land?

10:59.926 --> 11:02.227
Me!
( laughs )

11:04.964 --> 11:06.598
Don't worry,
Uncle Ceddy.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.433
I'll get you
out of this mess.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.235
Come-loosium!

11:12.138 --> 11:15.674
Oh, Calista,
what have you done?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.977
Freed my favorite uncle?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.812
You took Merlin's
dragon claw wand,

11:20.814 --> 11:23.782
and now Morgana's
going to use it
to defeat him.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.117
I didn't know
she was going to do that.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.619
What are we
going to do?

11:27.621 --> 11:30.121
Merlin invited us
into his tower--

11:30.123 --> 11:31.189
he trusted us--

11:31.191 --> 11:33.625
and this is how
you repay him?

11:33.627 --> 11:35.060
I'm...

11:35.062 --> 11:37.762
I'm sorry, Uncle Ceddy.
( crying )

11:39.965 --> 11:41.866
Oh, there, there,
little one.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.303
It's all right...
I mean, no, it's not all right.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.072
You can't just
take things like that.

11:47.074 --> 11:51.042
Please don't be mad
at me, Uncle Ceddy.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.044
( sniffling )

11:53.046 --> 11:54.979
I'll go get that wand
back for you,

11:54.981 --> 11:57.182
and everything
will be okay, right?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.584
We'll take
care of this,
together.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.886
Yes, but we've
got to do it

12:01.888 --> 12:05.023
before that egocentric
enchantress figures out

12:05.025 --> 12:07.258
how to unlock
the wand.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.828
Do you know the way
to Morgana's fortress,
Mr. Cedric?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.696
Yes. If memory serves,

12:11.698 --> 12:13.998
it's the last
evil fortress
on the left.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.633
You can't miss it.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.238
( thunder rumbling )

12:22.742 --> 12:25.944
CEDRIC: There it is.
Morgana's fortress.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.245
How can we get past those...

12:27.247 --> 12:28.847
What are they?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.583
Imps. Morgana uses them
as guards.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.618
( shudders )
Ugly little fiends.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.587
And they're always,
always hungry.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.956
Maybe we can distract them
with food,

12:37.958 --> 12:39.924
and sneak past them.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.793
Ooh, let me do it.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.196
Cookie-osity.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.831
Mmm, don't they
smell yummy?

12:49.735 --> 12:50.902
( sniffing )

12:50.904 --> 12:52.704
Do you smell something?

12:52.706 --> 12:54.806
Just your stinky breath.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.308
No, my breath
is more garlicky.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.377
This smells more like...

12:59.379 --> 13:01.846
BOTH: Cookies!

13:04.383 --> 13:06.317
Well done, Calista.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.153
Now's our chance.

13:16.395 --> 13:19.097
Wow! Look at
all the mirrors.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.766
Morgana must really
like to look at herself.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.335
Let's find Merlin's wand
and get out of here.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.209
So red.
I want it.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.682
Wait! Calista!
Don't!

13:37.684 --> 13:40.318
CEDRIC: Oh, no. Get away
from that centaur!

13:40.320 --> 13:41.753
Calista!

13:44.657 --> 13:47.292
Who dares steal
my ruby?!

13:47.294 --> 13:50.295
- Come on.
- That is mine!

13:50.297 --> 13:52.163
- CEDRIC: Run!
- Come back,
thieving cowards!

13:52.165 --> 13:53.798
( whinnying )

13:53.800 --> 13:55.266
Through the doors!
Hurry!

13:57.169 --> 14:00.271
- Help!
- I'm coming, Calista.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.309
You cannot escape me,
foolish mortals.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.010
No!

14:09.215 --> 14:11.282
Go. Go!

14:11.284 --> 14:13.184
This way.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.220
Uncle Ceddy!

14:15.222 --> 14:17.322
- Keep running.
- But, Mr. Cedric...

14:17.324 --> 14:19.524
CEDRIC: Go!

14:24.296 --> 14:27.232
Imps!

14:27.234 --> 14:30.201
What's this?
A gurgler?

14:30.203 --> 14:33.238
It's burglar.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.839
That's what
I said.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.975
- Take him to Morgana.
- With pleasure.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.377
( Cedric groans )

14:40.412 --> 14:42.213
All I wanted
was for Mr. Cedric

14:42.215 --> 14:44.415
to have
a special day.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.317
Why do you have
to take things, Calista?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.052
I don't know, Sofia.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.321
It's just, there's
so many things I want.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.156
We all want things,

14:52.158 --> 14:53.424
but that doesn't mean
we can just take them,

14:53.426 --> 14:55.827
especially when
they belong to somebody else.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.328
I know.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.331
I didn't think something
this bad could happen.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.767
That's the problem.
You didn't think at all.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.235
You just took things.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.271
You're right.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.506
I would trade everything
I ever took

15:08.508 --> 15:10.942
if it would get me
my Uncle Ceddy back.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.944
What are we
going to do?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.914
There's only one thing
we can do; get help
from Merlin.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.082
You have to tell him
you took his wand,

15:18.084 --> 15:19.918
and you have to say
you're sorry.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.154
Okay.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.424
I'm sorry
I took your wand.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.359
If you help us
save Uncle Ceddy,

15:28.361 --> 15:32.096
I promise I'll never
take anything ever again.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.465
I forgive you, child.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.401
But without
my dragon claw wand,

15:36.403 --> 15:39.270
I'm no magical match
for Morgana.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.473
I certainly can't
break into her fortress
without it.

15:42.475 --> 15:46.377
However, there is more than
one way to scale a dragon.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.980
What this calls for
is a clever plan.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.315
Aw!

15:50.317 --> 15:52.283
Hm. You know,

15:52.285 --> 15:54.385
Morgana has so many
mirrors in her fortress,

15:54.387 --> 15:56.321
it's like she
collects them.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.390
Maybe she'd like
one more

15:59.392 --> 16:01.326
with some surprise
visitors inside it.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.929
My dear, I believe
she just might.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.498
Now where is that bowl
of reflecting pool water?

16:07.500 --> 16:10.468
( thunder rumbling )

16:12.838 --> 16:15.440
"Place the wand
you wish to unlock

16:15.442 --> 16:17.408
on the altar
of unraveling."

16:17.410 --> 16:21.012
There. Good.

16:21.014 --> 16:26.150
"Next, fit the glass stone
securely over the altar."

16:26.152 --> 16:28.519
What? Wait.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.321
Which way does it go?

16:30.323 --> 16:32.490
Some evil sorceress
you are.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.926
Can't even follow
simple directions.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.327
Silence!

16:36.329 --> 16:38.096
I need to concentrate.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.265
Excuse me,
Your Evilness.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.534
Didn't I say
not to disturb me?

16:43.536 --> 16:46.537
You did. It's just that
I thought--

16:46.539 --> 16:50.041
Don't think.
It's not your strong suit.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.376
What have you
got there?

16:51.378 --> 16:55.313
What we got to show you,
O Evil One.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.316
Someone left this
on the doorstep.

16:58.318 --> 17:03.287
Note says: "Please accept
this special gift

17:03.289 --> 17:06.190
from one of your
biggest admirals."

17:06.192 --> 17:07.692
Admirers.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.060
That's what I said.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.528
Okay. Open it.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.000
Ah, a mirror.
Well...

17:16.002 --> 17:19.537
it does reflect
my absolute favorite thing.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.506
But I've got
oodles of mirrors.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.375
Why does this one
belong in my fortress?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.477
What makes it
so special?

17:26.479 --> 17:30.214
SOFIA: Why, the beautiful
face gazing into it, of course.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.382
- Blimey!
- It talks.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.683
( gasps )
Sofia!

17:32.685 --> 17:34.385
Do go on.

17:34.387 --> 17:38.689
You are fairer than
the fairest of the fair.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.526
Agreed. Anything else?

17:41.528 --> 17:44.595
Your eyes are like
pretty flowers,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.497
and your lips are like...

17:46.499 --> 17:48.266
Oh... ( giggles )

17:48.268 --> 17:51.069
- like...
- CALISTA: A bug?

17:51.071 --> 17:53.471
Ugh! Take that thing away.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.742
Bugs?

17:57.744 --> 18:01.212
Sorry. It was the first
thing that popped in my head.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.182
SOFIA: Wait! I mean...
waaaait!

18:04.184 --> 18:08.586
Of all the faces that have
ever gazed into my glass,

18:08.588 --> 18:13.224
yours is by far
the most amazingly beautiful.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.426
Oh!

18:15.428 --> 18:18.596
CALISTA: You are way prettier
than the sleeping princess

18:18.598 --> 18:21.599
or the one with
the glass slipper.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.368
Oh, well,
that's better.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.270
I suppose
you can stay.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.372
Put it over there, boys.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.208
Go do whatever
it is you do

18:30.210 --> 18:33.111
when you're not
bothering me.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.713
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.183
"Fit the glass
dome securely over
the altar."

18:40.285 --> 18:41.552
You go for your uncle.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.688
- I'll get Merlin's wand.
- Right.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.491
"Once the dome is attached,

18:46.493 --> 18:50.428
twist it in
a counter-clockwise direction.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.265
Next, drop three
troll tears on the dome

18:54.267 --> 18:58.269
along with a pinch
of Pegasus powder."

18:58.271 --> 18:59.570
Wait a moment.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.440
Where do I sprinkle
the unicorn hair?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.475
"See instructions"

19:04.477 --> 19:06.677
Whoever drew these pictures
should be banished.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.687
You! And you?!

19:16.689 --> 19:18.756
Mr. Merlin, catch!

19:20.425 --> 19:23.227
- Hello, Morgana.
- And you!

19:24.596 --> 19:26.430
What's the matter?

19:26.432 --> 19:27.865
Don't you like
what you see in the mirror?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.868
Oh, I'll destroy
all of you for this.

19:52.891 --> 19:56.727
How about a little taste
of your own magical medicine?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.563
Your two wands
can't defeat me.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.299
How about three?

20:05.504 --> 20:07.772
Princess, put that mirror
behind her.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.655
( Morgana gasping )
What is this?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.358
What have you done?
Where am I?

20:27.360 --> 20:31.395
Someplace where you can reflect
on your evil deeds for a while.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.597
Oh!

20:32.599 --> 20:35.499
We did it,
we got you back!

20:35.501 --> 20:37.501
Thank you, Calista.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.671
Your Uncle Ceddy
is so proud of you.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.944
Well, my friends,
I suppose this
is good-bye again.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.512
Good-bye, Mr. Merlin.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.581
Sorry about all the trouble
we caused.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.550
Oh, nonsense.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.919
I haven't had
this much fun in years.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.723
Farewell. I shall always
remember the name

20:58.725 --> 21:00.691
Cedric the Sensational.

21:01.893 --> 21:03.828
- Where's Calista?
- Coming.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.731
BOTH: Calista!

21:06.733 --> 21:08.532
How could you
take that

21:08.534 --> 21:09.767
after all
we've been through?

21:09.769 --> 21:13.304
Now, now,
the girl didn't take it.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.939
I gave her the hat.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.875
Turns out all I had
to do was ask,

21:17.877 --> 21:20.077
which is what I'm
going to do from now on.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.446
That's really good
to hear, Calista.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.815
Let's go home,
Uncle Ceddy.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.485
Indeed, Calista.
Let's.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.720
- Farewell
- Good-bye, Mr. Merlin.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.856
CEDRIC: Good-bye.
