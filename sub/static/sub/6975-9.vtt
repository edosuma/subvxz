WEBVTT

00:04.320 --> 00:08.313
lt's just senseless.
A man so young as Ray.

00:10.093 --> 00:12.823
lt's God's cruel trick, Nora.

00:12.896 --> 00:16.992
Don't go blaming God, Curt.
You and l know what killed Ray.

00:17.067 --> 00:21.003
Well, we don't know anything for sure.

00:21.071 --> 00:26.566
How does a 41-year-old man
just wither away and die?

00:26.643 --> 00:31.239
lf any of us knew that,
we'd have done somethin' about it.

00:32.247 --> 00:35.115
Maybe it was just his time.

00:35.185 --> 00:38.985
He was a young man
when he went over, Curt.

00:39.055 --> 00:43.389
- Ray got sick because he fought in the Gulf.
- Now, don't go there, Nora.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.224
You just make it worse.
The doctors never said...

00:46.296 --> 00:49.163
They never said. That's right.

00:51.067 --> 00:54.594
My husband's dead, and no one knows why.

00:54.671 --> 00:57.606
Maybe l have to find out myself.

01:00.844 --> 01:03.540
They're gonna pay for Ray's death,
whoever's to blame.

01:03.613 --> 01:06.946
No one's to blame. You're just upset.

01:07.951 --> 01:12.650
- You need a good night's sleep.
- l don't wanna sleep, l just...

01:15.125 --> 01:17.525
You just want Ray back.

01:17.594 --> 01:20.290
We all do.

01:20.864 --> 01:24.265
Get some rest. l'll see you tomorrow, OK?

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

02:44.881 --> 02:46.007
Ray?

03:54.884 --> 03:58.149
The car's registered
to a Curtis Delario, local address.

03:58.221 --> 04:00.689
So far he's been unreachable.

04:00.757 --> 04:05.319
lt's highly unlikely that wherever he is,
he feels like picking up the phone.

04:05.395 --> 04:10.458
Muncie PD ran some calculations. Based on
distance traveled and length of skid marks,

04:10.533 --> 04:15.732
the car was going at least 40 when it impacted
the object, which, according to their math,

04:15.805 --> 04:20.833
would require something 4300 times
the density of steel to cause this damage.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.071
Hm.

04:23.146 --> 04:25.512
lt's interesting, isn't it?

04:25.581 --> 04:28.448
l mean, in light of the evidence.

04:48.438 --> 04:52.898
From their size and shape,
these look like men's shoes.

04:52.976 --> 04:57.777
l hope you're not suggesting that what this
car hit was a man, because there's no way.

04:57.847 --> 05:01.578
Well, these impressions in the asphalt
look pretty fresh to me.

05:01.651 --> 05:05.917
l admit to the coincidence, but you know
as well as l that if a man were here,

05:05.989 --> 05:09.390
he'd be splattered,
and there's just no evidence of that.

05:09.459 --> 05:13.122
You're right.
Which is suspicious in and of itself.

05:13.196 --> 05:19.294
This car definitely hit something, and the only
evidence that we have are these two prints.

05:23.773 --> 05:28.710
l hate to ruin your beautiful theory with
ugly facts, but stop to examine the incident.

05:28.778 --> 05:31.770
lf a man were standing here,
the driver would have stopped.

05:31.848 --> 05:33.941
lt looks like he tried to.

05:34.017 --> 05:38.113
lf a man were in the middle of the road
with a car coming, wouldn't he try to move?

05:38.187 --> 05:40.712
Unless he wanted to stop the car.

05:40.790 --> 05:44.351
Yes, but if nothing less than
a block of steel could stop this car,

05:44.427 --> 05:48.989
then, ipso facto, it could not have been
a man standing in the street last night.

05:49.065 --> 05:51.727
Or certainly no ordinary man.

05:56.506 --> 06:00.203
Just tell me what happened.
Where is he? Where...?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.540
Excuse me, ma'am.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.876
John Doggett with the FBl.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.314
- You know about this?
- What happened? Where is he?

06:08.384 --> 06:12.150
- Curtis Delario, you know him?
- He was a friend of my husband's.

06:12.221 --> 06:15.952
- They worked at the salvage yard.
- l want you to calm down, Mrs...?

06:16.025 --> 06:19.825
Pearce. How am l supposed to calm down?
Finding this now, it...

06:19.896 --> 06:23.388
- We're not even sure he was driving the car.
- He was.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.299
He came over after my husband's funeral,
then he left...

06:26.369 --> 06:28.530
Agent Doggett.

06:40.550 --> 06:43.110
Meet Curtis Delario.

06:45.054 --> 06:48.683
l guess he won't be much help
clearing any of this up.

07:00.103 --> 07:02.264
l think l got some answers.

07:02.338 --> 07:07.139
So do l. lt wasn't the crash
that killed Curtis Delario.

07:07.210 --> 07:11.010
He was badly injured,
but he was clearly still alive

07:11.080 --> 07:15.414
when his body was pulled
through the car's windshield.

07:15.485 --> 07:16.679
Pulled?

07:16.752 --> 07:21.951
Yeah. These five deep puncture marks
match five fingers of one hand.

07:22.024 --> 07:26.154
- You mean someone reached right in and...?
- Like a bowling ball.

07:26.229 --> 07:30.757
- That seems humanly impossible.
- Certainly for any ordinary man.

07:32.768 --> 07:39.799
From the evidence l've gathered, the man
that did this is actually less than ordinary.

07:40.810 --> 07:45.304
l was able to reconstruct a section of the
windshield and lift a print from the glass.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.782
- Whose?
- Raymond Aloysius Pearce.

07:48.851 --> 07:53.083
Husband of Nora Pearce,
woman l spoke with at the accident site.

07:53.156 --> 07:55.954
Her recently deceased husband.

07:56.959 --> 08:00.759
Well, if he was recently deceased,
then it must have been an old print.

08:00.830 --> 08:06.860
Well, what you would think, except along with
the print, there was evidence of fresh blood.

08:06.936 --> 08:09.928
And it belongs to Ray Pearce too.

09:32.121 --> 09:33.554
Mrs Pearce.

09:33.623 --> 09:38.822
Agent Doggett again. Sorry to bother you,
but there are some things l need to go over.

09:38.894 --> 09:42.159
- Everything all right, Nora?
- He's with the FBl.

09:42.231 --> 09:47.760
This is Harry Odell. He runs
the salvage yard where Ray and Curt worked.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.032
May l come in?

09:55.111 --> 09:57.636
Agent Doggett, l don't understand.

09:57.713 --> 10:03.049
Before, you were talking about Curt.
Now you wanna talk about Ray?

10:03.119 --> 10:05.610
What was their relationship, Mrs Pearce,

10:05.688 --> 10:08.555
your husband and Curtis Delario -
outside of work?

10:08.624 --> 10:13.687
l know what their relationship is now.
They're both dead.

10:13.763 --> 10:18.826
Your husband's medical record says that
he died after a long, debilitating illness?

10:18.901 --> 10:21.369
Gulf War syndrome.

10:21.437 --> 10:26.932
No one will cop to that, but l aim to
prove it. Put the blame where it belongs.

10:27.009 --> 10:31.503
l'm having trouble proving
something myself, Mrs Pearce.

10:31.580 --> 10:36.449
You signed a form to have your husband
cremated, but it appears it never happened.

10:36.519 --> 10:39.147
What do you mean?

10:39.221 --> 10:42.554
They gave me the ashes.
They were at the funeral.

10:42.625 --> 10:46.789
l can't find a record of Ray's body
ever even being at the crematorium.

10:46.862 --> 10:51.629
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Hasn't this woman grieved enough?

10:51.701 --> 10:56.900
Let me get to the point, Mrs Pearce.
ls it possible your husband is still alive?

10:56.972 --> 10:59.406
Still alive?

10:59.475 --> 11:03.241
- ls this ajoke?
- Because we have evidence to suggest

11:03.312 --> 11:08.579
that maybe your husband was involved
in the death of Curtis Delario.

11:08.651 --> 11:10.642
Are you saying Ray faked his death?

11:10.720 --> 11:15.384
We found Ray's blood
and fingerprints on Curt's car.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.886
l watched him die.

11:20.963 --> 11:25.195
l nursed him when he was sick,
when he couldn't eat.

11:25.267 --> 11:31.297
What you're saying is impossible. He couldn't
even walk or lift his head at the end.

11:35.344 --> 11:37.642
Ray Pearce worked for me nine years.

11:37.713 --> 11:41.809
He was a good man.
He never raised a hand to anyone.

12:07.543 --> 12:10.376
Hey. How you doin'?

12:11.614 --> 12:14.777
Ray, right? They said you're new.

12:16.085 --> 12:18.110
Rough night?

12:19.488 --> 12:22.946
You're eating the tinfoil on the...

12:29.565 --> 12:32.693
My name's Larina. l help out around here.

12:32.768 --> 12:35.828
You might have some questions
about how it all works.

12:35.905 --> 12:39.306
l don't know. lt's pretty basic.

12:42.812 --> 12:44.973
Look.

12:45.881 --> 12:49.817
l've been down the road and back a few times

12:49.885 --> 12:54.720
and l just wanna say you're not alone, Ray.

12:55.224 --> 13:01.561
l mean, l've been where you've been
and sometimes it can help.

13:02.598 --> 13:04.463
You know?

13:04.533 --> 13:07.127
Sometimes it's good to just talk.

13:08.137 --> 13:10.401
Make a connection.

13:10.473 --> 13:13.840
You know what l'm sayin', Ray?

13:14.743 --> 13:18.474
So if there's anything
l can do for you, you know...

13:18.547 --> 13:21.277
You can leave me alone.

13:23.819 --> 13:25.150
OK.

14:36.692 --> 14:38.853
God Almighty.

14:40.596 --> 14:41.790
Ray.

14:41.864 --> 14:44.162
lt's true.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.632
Oh, you got everybody wonderin', man.

14:50.706 --> 14:55.734
And they're lookin' for you.
They blame you for killing Curt.

14:55.811 --> 14:59.042
Now, me and Curt, we're your friends.

14:59.114 --> 15:03.016
You can't blame this on us.
You gotta believe me, it wasn't us.

15:03.085 --> 15:07.385
Well, l can show you.
lt's right here, Ray. lt wasn't me.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.727
This time you stay dead.

16:24.833 --> 16:26.357
Scully.

16:26.435 --> 16:30.201
Did you find anything to go along
with those holes in Curt Delario's head?

16:30.272 --> 16:33.298
Paint on his hands and nails?

16:33.375 --> 16:36.208
- Paint?
- Blue paint, specifically.

16:36.278 --> 16:38.439
Hang on.

16:44.153 --> 16:47.054
No. ls it significant?

16:47.122 --> 16:50.614
l don't know.
But Harry was a busy boy last night.

16:50.693 --> 16:53.355
He must've left Nora Pearce's
right after l saw him,

16:53.429 --> 16:56.694
right after he'd learned
that Ray Pearce might still be alive.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.959
To do what?

16:58.033 --> 17:02.868
lt's pretty clear he was in his office shredding
papers when he was surprised by someone.

17:02.938 --> 17:07.534
- And you think it was Ray?
- Well, somebody took a blast.

17:07.608 --> 17:11.271
There's blood all over the doors,
trailing down the stairs.

17:11.346 --> 17:15.612
- Massive blood loss.
- But the man with the gun is dead.

17:15.684 --> 17:18.949
l saw guys take hits in the war
that kept right on fighting,

17:19.021 --> 17:22.319
holding their insides in their hands.
lt's not impossible.

17:22.391 --> 17:25.827
But to do this to a man's head
after taking two barrels of buckshot...

17:25.894 --> 17:28.260
Or being hit by a car.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.822
l don't see how a man could possibly do this.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.630
Well, maybe the question's not how, but why.

17:34.703 --> 17:40.232
l mean, if Ray Pearce did indeed kill
this man, what would be his reason?

17:40.309 --> 17:43.870
l'm not sure.
but l know where to start lookin'.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.195
Hello?

18:46.975 --> 18:48.806
Ray?

19:01.990 --> 19:04.584
Ray. You OK?

19:09.998 --> 19:13.365
Somebody saw you come in
with blood on you.

19:14.636 --> 19:17.264
l can see it on your clothes.

19:20.142 --> 19:22.303
Look, Ray.

19:23.045 --> 19:27.573
l know it never does anybody any good
getting the cops involved, OK?

19:27.649 --> 19:30.243
Look, l've been there, man.

19:30.319 --> 19:34.312
l know what it's like to feel dark and alone.

19:35.791 --> 19:38.555
l can get a doctor for you.

19:38.627 --> 19:41.755
Get out.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.997
Get out.

19:48.503 --> 19:50.334
OK.

19:52.307 --> 19:54.070
OK.

19:58.413 --> 20:04.318
They're called ''smart metals''. The idea is to
one day build things that are indestructible.

20:04.386 --> 20:08.413
Cars, equipment, built of alloys
with molecular memory.

20:08.490 --> 20:11.948
lf damaged, they'd rebuild
into their original forms.

20:12.027 --> 20:14.154
All by themselves?

20:15.163 --> 20:19.566
- That's amazing.
- And right now, a metallurgist's pipe dream.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.230
But beside the point of your visit,
l would imagine.

20:23.305 --> 20:29.210
Well, you tell me. l found a document at
a crime scene listing Chamber Technologies.

20:29.278 --> 20:33.942
An employee number on the document
was assigned to a Dr David Clifton.

20:34.016 --> 20:36.678
Dr Clifton's no longer here.

20:37.686 --> 20:41.588
- What happened to him?
- He left the company.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.751
l'm actually his successor in this department.

20:44.826 --> 20:49.661
Do you deal with a man named Harry Odell
or a business called Southside Salvage?

20:49.731 --> 20:52.928
No, l don't deal with materials.
Nor did Dr Clifton.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.799
Our work here is all theoretical.

20:55.871 --> 20:59.204
We have an environmental manager
in charge of waste management,

20:59.274 --> 21:05.110
but disposal is done at TSD facilities,
definitely not city salvage yards.

21:05.180 --> 21:09.241
- Thanks for your time, Doctor...
- Puvogel. German, no h.

21:09.318 --> 21:13.618
- You need me to spell it for you?
- No, no. That's quite all right.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.350
Thanks.

21:21.964 --> 21:25.422
- Scully.
- Hey. lt's Agent Doggett.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.958
- l'm at Chamber Technologies.
- Did you find Dr Clifton?

21:29.037 --> 21:33.599
He's left the company, but his successor
says his work was entirely conceptual.

21:33.675 --> 21:37.475
- Everything's done on computers.
- What kind of conceptual work?

21:37.546 --> 21:40.310
Thing called smart metals.
lt's pretty incredible.

21:40.382 --> 21:44.011
Metal alloys designed to rebuild themselves.

21:44.086 --> 21:46.247
l wonder.

21:46.321 --> 21:50.883
As it happens, Ray Pearce's illness
is pretty incredible, too.

21:50.959 --> 21:53.519
l've reviewed Ray's medical records
from the VA.

21:53.595 --> 21:57.395
What his wife was calling Gulf War syndrome
is nothing of the kind.

21:57.466 --> 22:03.837
His entire cellular makeup was affected by
exposure to a non-identifiable contaminant.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.896
A metal.

22:05.974 --> 22:09.910
What are you sayin'? Ray Pearce
has become some kind of metal man?

22:09.978 --> 22:13.072
That only happens in the movies,
Agent Scully.

22:13.148 --> 22:15.673
Does it, Agent Doggett?

22:15.751 --> 22:20.450
Tell you what. l'll press this guy here
a little more on the issue.

22:20.522 --> 22:26.017
Maybe there's a reason why he's
not being perfectly forthcoming.

22:36.004 --> 22:39.735
Police are seeking clues in
last night's bloody robbery and murder

22:39.808 --> 22:42.140
at Muncie's Southside Salvage.

22:42.210 --> 22:46.647
Workmen found the body of 53-year-old
Harry Odell outside his office

22:46.715 --> 22:49.548
at approximately 7:30 this morning.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.520
Detectives have refused to comment on
the cause of death pending an autopsy,

22:53.588 --> 22:57.991
but sources close to the case describe this
as a vicious and grisly attack.

22:58.060 --> 23:01.996
Robbery appears to be
the motive behind this...

23:05.801 --> 23:09.635
- Operator 525. What city, please?
- Muncie.

23:09.704 --> 23:11.934
Number for a Raymond Pearce.

23:19.981 --> 23:22.108
- Sorry l'm late.
- lt's all right.

23:22.184 --> 23:24.880
l just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce,

23:24.953 --> 23:28.445
and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce
pronounced dead three days ago.

23:28.523 --> 23:33.187
But that's not all. By all medical standards,
he should still be dead.

23:33.261 --> 23:38.198
His blood has enough metal alloy in it
to poison an elephant.

23:38.266 --> 23:41.326
Except that he's still a man,
and he'll act and think like one

23:41.403 --> 23:43.837
even if he is more powerful
than a locomotive.

23:43.905 --> 23:46.999
But then the question is, why kill his friends?

23:47.075 --> 23:51.603
l mean, if he was wronged somehow,
wouldn't he go to them for solace?

23:51.680 --> 23:54.740
- l mean, to his wife, at least?
- That's why l was late.

23:54.816 --> 23:59.651
l asked myself that same question.
Ray was an outpatient at the VA.

23:59.721 --> 24:03.817
He had a history of substance abuse.
Did some time for a couple of DUls.

24:03.892 --> 24:06.725
- This was ten years ago.
- Cleaned up his act.

24:06.795 --> 24:10.822
He met Nora and married her in '91,
checked into a rehab and got straight.

24:10.899 --> 24:15.859
This was a guy to root for, that overcame
adversity and made a life for himself.

24:15.937 --> 24:20.533
- Until three days ago.
- l've busted a lot of killers, Agent Scully,

24:20.609 --> 24:23.305
and dollars for doughnuts, they fit a profile.

24:23.378 --> 24:26.040
But the Ray Pearce in this file is no murderer,

24:26.114 --> 24:30.210
let alone a guy that would hunt down
his friends and crush their skulls.

24:30.285 --> 24:34.779
The man that we're speaking about
withstood impact from a speeding car,

24:34.856 --> 24:38.417
and two shotgun blasts at short range.

24:39.528 --> 24:41.860
Even if we can find him,

24:43.098 --> 24:45.566
who's to say we can stop him?

26:38.313 --> 26:41.840
- Make sure that door is secure.
- Dr Puvogel,

26:41.916 --> 26:45.784
are you sure he can't
open that door from the inside?

26:45.854 --> 26:49.051
l've got a manual override on the door.

26:57.132 --> 26:59.828
What the hell was that?

27:00.602 --> 27:02.695
Ray Pearce.

27:06.474 --> 27:09.602
The door is four inches thick.

27:10.745 --> 27:15.205
- l don't think it's gonna hold.
- You'd better hope it does,

27:15.283 --> 27:20.414
cos if it doesn't, he's coming after you,
and l don't know if we can stop him.

27:36.271 --> 27:39.240
Open it up.

27:39.307 --> 27:41.468
Get it open.

27:43.144 --> 27:47.240
There's a rupture in the chamber.
l don't believe this.

28:24.519 --> 28:26.510
Agent Doggett.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.287
Look at this. You see this?

28:35.163 --> 28:38.223
What is that? ls that blood?

28:38.299 --> 28:40.961
Turning itself into metal.

28:46.908 --> 28:49.399
Get him out of the building.

28:49.477 --> 28:54.676
- l didn't do anything to the man.
- You wanna argue, or go someplace safe?

28:54.749 --> 28:58.742
- Where's that? Where's safe?
- lt's not in here.

29:33.154 --> 29:35.645
My God.

29:35.723 --> 29:39.454
- lt's true.
- You shouldn't have come, Nora.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.995
l shouldn't have come?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.861
That's what you say to me?

29:48.136 --> 29:50.969
l'm your wife.

29:52.073 --> 29:55.474
l came here because you didn't come to me.

29:59.347 --> 30:02.077
l had to have some stranger tell me.

30:03.084 --> 30:05.917
Why didn't you come, Ray?

30:05.987 --> 30:08.717
Because l'm not me.

30:25.106 --> 30:27.472
l don't care what's happened.

30:27.542 --> 30:30.136
Whatever it is, it's a miracle.

30:32.447 --> 30:35.041
Don't go.

30:38.586 --> 30:42.647
- There's your miracle.
- Ray, let me help you.

30:43.491 --> 30:46.153
Please, let me help.

30:54.335 --> 30:57.771
They've got to pay for this.

30:57.839 --> 31:00.774
They've all got to pay.

32:16.584 --> 32:19.246
Oh my God.

32:26.027 --> 32:29.656
What's going on?
lt's not enough that my life's been threatened.

32:29.731 --> 32:33.690
- l'm being treated like a criminal.
- And not without cause.

32:33.768 --> 32:36.669
- Oh my God.
- Do you recognize this man?

32:37.338 --> 32:44.107
We're assuming you don't know
too many guys in this particular condition.

32:46.180 --> 32:51.982
- lt's not what it looks like.
- ls this Dr David Clifton, your predecessor?

32:59.127 --> 33:01.857
- Yes.
- You care to explain how he ended up

33:01.929 --> 33:04.489
in a Chamber Technology
hazardous waste barrel?

33:04.565 --> 33:06.658
lt was his idea. l was against it.

33:06.734 --> 33:12.229
lf you knew, you might've told me
about this when l first came to see you.

33:12.306 --> 33:15.935
He was dying, and he was afraid.

33:16.010 --> 33:20.572
- Of what?
- That it would hinder progress, or halt it.

33:20.648 --> 33:24.049
- That it would finish us.
- Oh, you're finished.

33:24.118 --> 33:30.421
- One way or another, your work here is done.
- We didn't know this was gonna happen.

33:30.491 --> 33:36.862
We were just trying to push the envelope,
do the right thing for the company.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.593
Then he got sick.

33:40.635 --> 33:47.507
He was working with an alloy
with a genetic algorithm built into it.

33:47.575 --> 33:53.070
lt converted electrical energy
into mechanical. Gave it memory.

33:53.147 --> 33:55.479
And it poisoned him.

33:55.550 --> 33:59.418
We immediately shut down the project.

33:59.487 --> 34:02.456
But it was too late.

34:02.523 --> 34:05.253
He didn't have any family.

34:05.326 --> 34:11.356
His work was his life. He wanted to leave us
to continue working on the science.

34:11.431 --> 34:17.530
And to ship this barrel and body to Southside
Salvage, where it infected somebody else.

34:17.605 --> 34:20.835
l don't know how that happened,
l swear to God.

34:22.710 --> 34:27.112
That barrel was supposed to go
to a designated site.

34:30.618 --> 34:33.382
Let me talk to you for a second.

34:40.261 --> 34:42.889
l think he's telling the truth.

34:43.898 --> 34:46.492
What the hell is she doing here?

34:48.503 --> 34:53.031
- Who is it?
- Nora Pearce, Ray's wife.

35:13.161 --> 35:15.959
Mrs Pearce?

35:16.030 --> 35:18.760
What are you doin' here?

35:19.801 --> 35:22.861
How do you know about this place?

35:22.937 --> 35:25.337
She was looking for something.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.141
Who'd you call, Mrs Pearce?

36:19.227 --> 36:21.320
Let's check in here.

36:21.395 --> 36:24.057
Police.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.805
- You want us to take her in?
- l want to talk to her.

36:33.875 --> 36:38.141
Your husband just
broke through a second-storey wall

36:38.212 --> 36:41.704
and eluded a dozen cops at St Clare House.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.649
That please you, Mrs Pearce?

36:44.719 --> 36:50.248
Does it please you to know that he killed
a woman volunteer named Larina Jackson?

36:50.324 --> 36:55.261
That makes three people. Three people
that he's killed, and for what?

36:55.329 --> 36:58.093
Because they made him what he is.

36:58.165 --> 37:03.569
They say this young woman he killed tonight
had been concerned for him,

37:03.638 --> 37:06.903
concerned for Ray's welfare.

37:06.974 --> 37:12.344
Whatever Ray is, whatever he's become,
it was an accident.

37:13.180 --> 37:18.117
- lt was not those people's fault, Mrs Pearce.
- Harry and Curt knew about it.

37:18.185 --> 37:23.350
No, they were innocent, just like Ray was.
They didn't know this was gonna happen.

37:23.424 --> 37:26.120
These people here knew.
They got documents on it.

37:26.193 --> 37:29.060
Oh, so that's what this is about?

37:29.130 --> 37:32.964
This is about
looking for somebody to blame?

37:33.034 --> 37:37.494
Ray sent you here, didn't he,
to find that person, to get a name?

37:37.571 --> 37:40.563
The Ray l know died.

37:42.643 --> 37:46.875
- The man responsible should pay for that.
- So who is it?

37:47.481 --> 37:50.644
lt's the CEO here? The owner?

37:51.252 --> 37:55.018
Give us a name, Mrs Pearce,
before someone else has to die.

37:55.089 --> 37:57.922
l never gave him a name.

38:03.364 --> 38:07.266
Get her outta here. Put her on 24-hour watch.

38:14.008 --> 38:17.000
We'll be right outside, ma'am.

38:35.529 --> 38:37.520
Nora?

38:38.733 --> 38:42.794
- They're right outside, Ray.
- Did you get me the name?

38:42.870 --> 38:45.668
You killed her.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.904
The woman who called me.
For God's sake, Ray, why?

38:49.977 --> 38:52.810
Why her? She cared about you.

38:58.285 --> 39:00.719
l need the name.

39:00.788 --> 39:03.552
No one else needs to die, Ray.

39:07.661 --> 39:10.494
You won't do it, not to me.

39:10.564 --> 39:13.055
l need the man's name.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.871
- He's in the house.
- Go. Go.

39:38.325 --> 39:42.159
Tell the FBl agents it's Harris.
Ray made me give him the name.

39:42.229 --> 39:45.198
Owen Harris. Ray's gonna kill him.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.024
No. Owen.

40:15.096 --> 40:17.257
No. No.

40:17.331 --> 40:19.959
- Daddy.
- No.

40:20.701 --> 40:22.965
Owen Harris, don't look away.

40:24.505 --> 40:27.997
- Look at me.
- Why are you doing this?

40:28.075 --> 40:31.238
Because you made me.

40:31.312 --> 40:35.874
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Southside Salvage.

40:35.950 --> 40:38.783
- l'm just an accountant.
- Daddy.

40:40.955 --> 40:43.287
Daddy.

41:54.195 --> 41:56.288
Ray Pearce.

41:57.731 --> 42:01.462
He came here to kill this man,
but something stopped him, didn't it?

42:01.535 --> 42:03.730
This man, Owen Harris.

42:03.804 --> 42:06.034
He begged for his life.

42:06.106 --> 42:11.066
lt mightjust have saved him.
His attacker got up and ran away.

42:14.682 --> 42:20.348
Makes no sense. Pearce was a determined
killer, lookin' for someone to blame.

42:20.421 --> 42:22.651
Why stop here?

42:22.723 --> 42:27.319
Wherever Ray Pearce went,
the answer to that question went with him,

42:27.394 --> 42:31.057
but l can tell you
why he came after Owen Harris.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.793
lt was his name Nora found in the file.

42:33.867 --> 42:38.566
He authorized the shipment of
hazardous materials to Southside Salvage.

42:38.639 --> 42:43.099
But if Harris is the guy Ray
holds responsible, why'd Ray let him live?

42:43.177 --> 42:47.409
Well, l think that
Nora Pearce may have been right.

42:47.481 --> 42:51.008
Her husband died, or at least his body did.

42:51.085 --> 42:54.987
Whatever killed those people
was an abomination of a man.

42:55.055 --> 42:57.956
- lt was a machine.
- A machine?

42:59.760 --> 43:03.093
Come on. A machine
doesn't know blame, Agent Scully.

43:03.163 --> 43:05.961
Nor mercy.

43:06.767 --> 43:11.101
Unless what drove Ray to kill
is also what saved those people.

43:12.940 --> 43:16.273
Some flicker of humanity.
