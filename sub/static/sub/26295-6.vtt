WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:04.526
.

00:04.569 --> 00:05.962
- Jay. Red Eye,
triple espresso.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.224
- Thank you.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.660
- Man, you're gonna be wired
till Thursday

00:08.704 --> 00:10.358
with that much caffeine.
- This is not for me.

00:10.401 --> 00:13.752
You need all the energy
you can get for tonight.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.363
- Should've seen that coming.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.495
- You know, you and Nat are
very lucky that I'm letting you

00:17.539 --> 00:19.193
have a joint
bachelor/bachelorette party.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.455
So what do you want
to talk about?

00:20.498 --> 00:21.934
'Cause I got some
other surprises

00:21.978 --> 00:24.024
I got to setup for tonight.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.677
All right,
what am I looking at?

00:25.721 --> 00:28.115
- The EKG I got of Ray's heart
when I was planting the bug.

00:28.158 --> 00:31.161
- It's abnormal.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.989
I need to bring him
to the hospital.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.556
Run some tests--
- Whoa, whoa.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.037
You are not actually his
doctor, you know that right?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.908
- Jay, come on.
- You did your part.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.997
Now lay low until Agent Lee
says otherwise. That's it.

00:42.781 --> 00:46.220
Ricky. Irish whiskey and Oban.
Yeah, only the finest.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.135
I'll see you tonight.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.318
- Hello.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.233
- Can I help you
with something?

01:01.539 --> 01:04.368
- No, Maggie. Please.
- Oh, yes. Hey, Will.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.805
Can you tell your fiancé
to stop being a killjoy?

01:06.849 --> 01:09.199
She's got to wear this tonight.
- Maggie, I would like

01:09.243 --> 01:10.722
to maintain a little bit
of dignity.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.682
- You're wearing it.
This one's nonnegotiable.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.120
Hey, you two,
you're up.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.817
Ambo's pulling in with
a car crash.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.124
- Driver and passenger.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.735
Trauma 2.
- Got it.

01:23.779 --> 01:27.522
- Daria Carson. 29-year-old
female, restrained passenger.

01:27.565 --> 01:29.089
Driver lost control
of the wheel

01:29.132 --> 01:30.438
and went into the
guardrail.

01:30.481 --> 01:33.702
GCS 15. Vitals stable.
Refused board and collar.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.791
- Her husband, Adam.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.619
Wouldn't let us check him out.
- I'm fine, really.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.447
Just take care
of my wife, please.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.883
I'm--I'm right here, honey.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.363
- All right,
let's transfer on my count.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.800
Ready? One, two, three.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.456
- Thanks guys.
- Yup.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.157
- Breath sounds are normal.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.421
Periorbital bruising.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.902
Battle sign
over the right mastoid.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.470
Possible skull fracture.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.820
- Hey, why don't we go
next door so I can examine you?

02:04.863 --> 02:06.735
- I want to stay with my wife.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.433
- We're new--
new to be married.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.696
- Newlyweds.
- Congratulations.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.439
- Still working on the English.
- Sounds pretty good to me.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.224
- Oh, at least let me
check your blood pressure.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.616
We can do it right here.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.836
- All right, let me know
if you feel any pain

02:20.879 --> 02:22.490
or discomfort, okay?

02:23.317 --> 02:25.188
Does it hurt right there?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.147
- Let me take a look.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.455
- It's from crash.
- Oh, geez, babe.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.501
You really slammed
that dash, didn't you?

02:35.677 --> 02:37.983
- Your blood pressure's
a little high.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.637
- It's just the adrenaline.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.509
- Let's get a chest x-ray
and then send her over

02:41.552 --> 02:43.554
for a CT head with
a four vessel angio

02:43.598 --> 02:45.817
for her neck as well
as her chest, abdomen,

02:45.861 --> 02:48.298
and pelvis, okay?
We'll be right back.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.909
- Hey Adam, if you feel
lightheaded at all...

02:50.953 --> 02:53.695
- I know where
to find you, Doc, thanks.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.396
The guy worships her.
Won't leave her side.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.442
- Yeah,
I don't think that's it.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.272
The contusions
on her torso--they're old.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.317
They're not from the crash
and then one on her side

03:07.361 --> 03:09.363
looks like the tread of a boot.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.326
- Son of a bitch.

03:25.988 --> 03:26.162
.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.556
- Let me guess, unicorn.
- Nope, cotton candy.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.385
- Oh!
- My mom made it, actually.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.561
- Ten bags of cotton,

03:33.604 --> 03:35.911
hand-painted
and sewn to a leotard.

03:35.954 --> 03:38.783
- Impressive.
That is quite a labor of love.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.133
- I always lacked imagination
in that department.

03:41.177 --> 03:45.268
Pretty sure I was sheriff
all of elementary school.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.662
Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,
Gabby appears to have

03:47.705 --> 03:49.272
some swelling
in her lower legs as well.

03:49.316 --> 03:52.232
- She's been eating vegetarian.
Latest fad at school.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.234
Could it be her diet?
- I don't think so.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.279
The swelling, paired with
vomiting and jaundice

03:56.323 --> 03:58.803
makes me think
this may be a liver issue.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.936
Ultrasound?

04:00.979 --> 04:03.634
Gabby, you mind if we take
a closer look?

04:04.722 --> 04:07.029
- Um, we just assumed
it was a stomach bug.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.770
We would've brought her
in sooner if we thought

04:08.813 --> 04:11.076
it could be serious.
- Let's take a look.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.126
- Gallbladder looks normal.

04:17.169 --> 04:21.217
But her liver is nodular.
Looks cirrhotic.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.828
Isn't that from drinking?

04:23.872 --> 04:25.134
- I don't drink.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.005
- Gabby's never even tasted
alcohol.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.791
- Cirrhosis just means there's
scar tissue in her liver.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.315
So there are plenty of other
causes besides alcohol.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.317
- We'll run some tests to help
us narrow things down.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.407
April, CBC, CMP, LFT,
CT abdomen and pelvis

04:37.451 --> 04:40.192
and give 4 mg of Zofran
and 1 liter saline IV.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.325
- Got it.
- But I was supposed to set up

04:42.369 --> 04:44.806
for my Halloween dance tonight.
I have to be there.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.808
- Hey, worst comes to worst,
Dad will drop off

04:46.851 --> 04:49.245
the decorations for you,
Honey, okay?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.421
- We'll let you know as soon
as the results are in.

04:56.165 --> 04:59.037
Thanks.

05:03.215 --> 05:06.958
- I go inside.
- Yes, soon.

05:07.002 --> 05:10.005
I wanted to speak
with you first.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.964
The bruises on your body.

05:13.704 --> 05:16.185
They're not all from
the accident, are they?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.146
Is someone hurting you?

05:21.190 --> 05:25.063
- No.

05:26.543 --> 05:30.460
As your doctor, whatever
you say to me stays between us.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.244
He won't know.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.379
- We meet online.

05:36.423 --> 05:39.861
When Adam comes to Ukraine
to see me,

05:39.904 --> 05:44.169
he's gentleman,
handsome, kind.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.868
I fall in love.

05:46.911 --> 05:49.914
- How did you end up
in the States?

05:49.958 --> 05:52.700
- A year ago, there is...

05:52.743 --> 05:54.397
Trouble for my family.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.443
I must leave.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.881
Adam brings me here

05:59.924 --> 06:01.839
on visa to marry,

06:01.883 --> 06:06.496
but when I come,
he's a different man.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.892
Everything I do,
he get mad.

06:12.023 --> 06:16.376
Today, in car, I say something
he doesn't like and...

06:17.942 --> 06:20.902
- That's why the car went
into the rail.

06:20.945 --> 06:24.035
Daria, we can report this
to the police.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.387
- No, no. No police.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.736
Adam, he kill me.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.651
- There are shelters
you can stay at.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.870
- No, I cannot leave him.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.916
He will send me back,
no papers.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.440
But you're married.

06:37.484 --> 06:40.095
- He never files
for my green card.

06:40.138 --> 06:43.054
He says I'm a bad wife.

06:44.316 --> 06:47.885
You say I can trust you.
- Yes, you can trust me.

06:47.929 --> 06:51.889
- Please, no police.
I beg you.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.296
- She still visiting
Bernie every day?

07:07.339 --> 07:09.298
- Yeah. How can
she stay with him?

07:09.341 --> 07:11.039
He lied to her
about being married.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.825
Come on, don't tell me
you approve of this.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.914
- It doesn't matter
what I or you think.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.220
It's Emily's call to make.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.787
- I tried talking
some sense into her.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.310
Now somehow
I'm the bad guy.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.355
- He's the father of her child,
Ethan.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.924
- So it's not insane for her
to want at least

07:26.968 --> 07:29.013
try to make it work.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.630
- Well, Daria didn't go
into detail

07:36.673 --> 07:39.328
but I gather being deported
would put her life in danger.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.809
- Yeah, fear Adam is clearly
preying on.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.332
- Well, it's not uncommon.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.640
Abusive spouses using the
victim's immigration status

07:46.683 --> 07:48.511
to control or manipulate.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.817
- If she isn't legal,

07:49.860 --> 07:51.166
she's likely financially
dependent on him too.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.168
- He won't even let
her leave the house.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.865
- Yeah, the prick
has her trapped.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.563
- Let me talk to
an immigration attorney,

07:56.606 --> 07:59.304
see if we can't find a way out
for Mrs. Carson.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.393
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.309
- Dr. Choi,

08:04.353 --> 08:06.964
Gabby's been short of breath
for the last few minutes.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.445
- SATS are at 91. April,
let's get her on oxygen.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.493
- That's what I came
to speak to you about. Please.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.975
Gabby's CT did, in fact,
show cirrhosis

08:18.019 --> 08:20.978
and her labs, I'm afraid, are
consistent with liver failure.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.545
- Oh, my God.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.373
How

08:24.416 --> 08:27.550
- I have a theory, but I'd like
to do a quick exam to confirm.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.421
Excuse me.

08:29.465 --> 08:33.121
Hey, Gabby. Can you look
in the light for me?

08:37.473 --> 08:39.040
There.

08:39.083 --> 08:42.086
See the golden color
around her pupils?

08:42.130 --> 08:44.349
Those are called
Kayser-Fleischer rings.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.264
They're a sign
of Wilson's disease.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.353
- Well,

08:48.397 --> 08:50.573
when our bodies consume copper,

08:50.617 --> 08:52.880
our livers get rid
of the excess.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.142
But with Wilson's,

08:54.185 --> 08:55.970
the copper's
improperly eliminated

08:56.013 --> 08:58.276
so it builds up
in our vital organs.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.410
It's a hereditary disorder.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.020
Any family history
on either side?

09:03.064 --> 09:05.719
- No.
- I'm--I'm not sure.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.112
Uh, no. No.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.029
- Can we step outside
for a moment?

09:12.073 --> 09:14.597
- I'll keep Gabby company.
- Thanks.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.428
Right now, we're going to start
Gabby on plasmapheresis

09:19.471 --> 09:21.038
to remove the copper
from her blood,

09:21.082 --> 09:24.476
but ultimately, she will need
a liver transplant.

09:25.347 --> 09:29.264
Is

09:29.307 --> 09:31.048
- Yes, because the liver
regenerates,

09:31.092 --> 09:32.746
it's possible to donate
a segment.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.096
We just need a test to see
if any of you are a match.

09:35.139 --> 09:38.099
- Can friends and family
get tested as well?

09:38.142 --> 09:39.579
- The wider the net,
the better.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.494
- Good, we'll reach out
to everyone we know.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.759
- In the meantime, we'll set
you both up to get evaluated.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.325
Thank you.

09:55.072 --> 09:58.032
- Yes! So cute!
- Ooh!

09:58.075 --> 10:01.078
- Who are you guys
supposed to be?

10:01.122 --> 10:02.950
The Pink Ladies.
- Yes!

10:06.780 --> 10:08.564
- Oh, Dr. Lanik, uh,

10:08.608 --> 10:11.132
I changed the dressing
on the patient in Treatment 6

10:11.175 --> 10:13.656
and found the journal articles
you requested

10:13.700 --> 10:15.702
and here's your latte.

10:17.399 --> 10:18.748
- Wow.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.098
You know, I'm all about
giving the med students

10:21.142 --> 10:22.665
the occasional scut work,

10:22.709 --> 10:24.406
but having them fetch
you coffee, that's classy.

10:24.449 --> 10:28.149
- He wanted to. Rising star,
that kid. Real pleaser.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.675
- Dr. Rhodes.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.809
- Dr. Bekker.
What's on tap for you today?

10:35.852 --> 10:38.986
- Back to back CABG's.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.205
- I'll see if I
can squeeze you in.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.730
- Need some help over here.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.689
- Terry, come and help!

10:47.908 --> 10:49.257
- Working a job
a couple blocks away.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.693
Piece of sheet metal
fell on Mitch.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.521
Ripped his leg open.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.523
- The blood--never seen
anything like it.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.003
- All right, Maggie, tag in.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.352
We might have to move
to the hybrid OR.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.484
- Got you.
- Pupils are sluggish.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.923
- Pulse is thready. Maggie,
get an IV in, trigger the MTP.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.315
- I'm on it.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.708
- Large laceration through
the muscle.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.188
Femoral artery's severed.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.755
- Trauma to the femoral artery

11:08.798 --> 11:10.365
can cause massive
and rapid blood loss.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.802
- Bad. Prognosis is bad.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.848
- Breath sounds are weak.
I'm gonna intubate.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.371
Give me an Laryngoscope.
- On it.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.894
- I can get a 22 in the hand.

11:17.938 --> 11:21.550
- That'll have to do.
100 of sux, 20 of etomidate.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.683
Lanik, get an eight French line
in the groin.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.162
- Terry, you're up.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.860
I've only done practice runs.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.166
- Then you're ready.
Get to it.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.169
Beats scut work, right?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.696
- I can't see the cords.
Guy's really anterior.

11:36.739 --> 11:40.047
Maggie, cricoid pressure.
- Yep, got it.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.439
- C'mon. Hurry up.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.963
Get the catheter
and dilator over the wire.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.270
- BP's dropping.
- Lanik, step in.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.490
- Come on, Terry.
Guy's dying.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.754
- The guy needs blood.
Lanik, step in or I will.

11:53.582 --> 11:54.844
I'm in, bag him.

11:56.628 --> 11:58.630
- Done. I got it.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.592
Why is there so much blood?
What happened?

12:03.635 --> 12:06.421
- Damn it. You missed the vein.
You went into the artery.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.031
- All right,
we can't use that line.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.642
Give me a kit. I got to
get a line in the subclavian.

12:17.562 --> 12:17.737
.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.347
- I'm sorry.

12:19.390 --> 12:20.827
I was having trouble finding
my landmarks.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.698
I--everything
was moving so fast. I--

12:22.742 --> 12:24.482
- Well, next time we'll just
ask the guy to stop dying

12:24.526 --> 12:27.398
so you can catch up.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.270
- All right.
Let's get the blood going.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.838
Move him over to the hybrid OR.
We'll shunt the leg there.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.014
- You heard the man.
Let's get ready to travel.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.583
- Hey, results are back
for Gabby's dad.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.759
They couldn't test the mom.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.065
Preexisting condition?

12:42.109 --> 12:43.763
- Lupus.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.026
- Unfortunately,
he's not a match.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.814
- John's blood type is AB.
Gabby's type O.

12:51.858 --> 12:55.470
- He can't be
her biological father.

12:55.513 --> 12:57.124
- Remember how Jeanette
changed her answer

12:57.167 --> 12:59.561
when I asked them about
their family history?

12:59.604 --> 13:01.563
- John probably has no idea.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.783
- I'm going to pull in
Dr. Charles.

13:08.918 --> 13:12.008
- The radiologist
just read Daria's scans.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.491
- Do you see that blip,
right there?

13:16.534 --> 13:18.580
That's called
a pseudoaneurysm.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.756
The impact from the crash
tore the vessel,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.977
and now there's a small
blood clot covering the hole.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.632
- If it ruptures, it could
cause a life-threatening bleed.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.200
- We'll put you on medication

13:30.244 --> 13:31.593
to keep
your blood pressure low,

13:31.636 --> 13:33.290
and we'll monitor you
for the next 24-48 hours.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.597
- I'm here too, you know.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.338
- Then we'll start
anticoagulants

13:37.381 --> 13:38.556
and reimage you.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.775
If your condition worsens,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.864
we will need
to perform surgery.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.084
- In the interim,
it is very important

13:44.127 --> 13:45.694
that we keep Daria calm.

13:45.737 --> 13:48.436
Any stress or agitation could
spike her blood pressure,

13:48.479 --> 13:50.873
and cause the pseudoaneurysm
to rupture.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.962
We'll need to restrict
all visitors.

13:53.006 --> 13:56.139
- You don't mean me.
- Yes, actually we do.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.576
- I hope you understand.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.491
- She'll get nervous
if I'm not here.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.885
Uh, babe,
you don't want me to leave.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.106
I'll stay.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.498
- Your wife needs rest.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.632
- Hey man, do you have
a problem with me?

14:10.675 --> 14:12.852
- No, Mr. Carson.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.900
- Once a room opens up,
we'll move you upstairs.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.597
Thank you.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.121
Will?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.825
- Give me three minutes alone
with that guy.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.741
- We show him our cards,
he'll suspect we're onto him.

14:32.784 --> 14:35.048
It'll put Daria
at even greater risk.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.571
Be smart about this.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.273
- So if--if John's not
a match and I can't donate,

14:43.317 --> 14:44.840
what now?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.886
- Ms. Phillips, it is not
at all our intention to pry

14:46.929 --> 14:49.497
into your private affairs,
but at the same time

14:49.540 --> 14:51.542
it's important to us
to give your daughter

14:51.586 --> 14:53.327
the best care possible.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.894
- Okay.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.026
- And in reviewing you and your
husband's test results,

14:57.070 --> 15:00.160
it became evident that John is
not Gabby's biological father.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.031
- And we wanted to be
with you in private

15:02.075 --> 15:03.728
because we weren't
sure that John knew.

15:03.772 --> 15:07.515
- No, no.
It's not what you think.

15:07.558 --> 15:10.431
Gabby's adopted.
- Huh.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.086
- And when I asked about your
family history, you didn't--

15:13.129 --> 15:15.740
- No, uh, we didn't want to say
anything in front of Gabby.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.134
She--she doesn't know.

15:18.178 --> 15:21.094
- Mrs. Philips,
I know it's a stretch,

15:21.137 --> 15:24.358
but if we could locate any
of Gabby's blood relatives--

15:24.401 --> 15:26.186
- That's not possible.

15:26.229 --> 15:29.624
Um, Gabby was a ward of
the state when we adopted her.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.800
Her biological parents
were deceased

15:31.843 --> 15:34.759
and she had no other
known relatives.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.457
- Well, in that case,
we'll want to get Gabby

15:36.500 --> 15:38.241
onto the transplant list
right away.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.722
- Okay. Thank you.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.599
- Artery shunted.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.603
- Clamps are off.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.954
- Let's get him up to the ICU
to rewarm and resuscitate.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.565
- What about the line
in his artery?

15:57.608 --> 15:59.045
Don't you need to pull it out?

15:59.088 --> 16:00.394
- So we can watch him
bleed out?

16:00.437 --> 16:01.743
- We can't do that right now.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.527
He's too cold
and coagulopathic.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.789
We'll fix it when
his pressure

16:04.833 --> 16:06.313
and clotting are better.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.189
Where do you get off
treating him like that?

16:13.233 --> 16:15.626
What happened was
your responsibility.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.019
- I didn't stick
that guy's artery.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.412
- You were supposed
to be supervising.

16:18.455 --> 16:19.979
- Look, the only way
they learn is under pressure.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.981
- Not when it endangers
my patient.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.852
You got your line in.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.680
Disaster was averted.
No harm, no foul.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.160
- If you ever pull something
like that again--

16:27.203 --> 16:29.466
- Hey, you might've been
the golden boy up in CT,

16:29.510 --> 16:31.773
but down here
I'm in charge.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.775
And I will supervise
my med students

16:33.818 --> 16:36.212
in whatever way I see fit.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.914
- Glad to see you found a new
sparring partner down here.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.308
Would hate to see you getting
rusty in my absence.

16:45.352 --> 16:46.962
- That guy is an egomaniac.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.746
- Well, takes one
to know one, right?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.188
Come on. Buy you lunch?
- Yeah.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.455
Hey, I was wondering how long
does Gabby have to be

17:01.498 --> 17:04.632
on the transplant list
before she gets a new liver?

17:04.675 --> 17:06.068
- Um--

17:06.112 --> 17:07.722
- Please, just--
just level with me.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.985
- I'm afraid I can't give you
a definitive answer.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.119
It can take days. Weeks.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.208
Sometimes, honestly,
even years.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.644
- Well, unfortunately,

17:16.687 --> 17:18.820
demand vastly outweighs supply.

17:18.863 --> 17:22.302
It's why living donor
transplantation was developed.

17:22.345 --> 17:26.828
- Uh, it's not possible for
a drug addict to donate, is it?

17:26.871 --> 17:29.700
- Honey.

17:29.744 --> 17:33.400
I got you a coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

17:33.443 --> 17:37.230
- No, she can't--

17:39.188 --> 17:41.799
- She's having a seizure.
5 of Ativan IV.

17:41.843 --> 17:44.106
Let's get a brain CT, just to
make sure there are no bleeds.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.065
What are you talking--

17:46.108 --> 17:48.632
- It's just a precaution. Here,
let's let them do their job.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.939
- Antivan's in.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.767
Okay, okay.
- Easy.

18:10.741 --> 18:11.133
.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.570
- You know, some people have
this great knack

18:13.614 --> 18:18.097
for hearing cardiac murmurs
or a palpating pulse.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.316
But no one picks up a scalpel

18:20.360 --> 18:23.493
and instinctively knows
how to open a chest.

18:24.277 --> 18:28.411
Procedures take practice
and repetition.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.240
You'll get better with time.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.463
Maybe this was a mistake.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.900
- Med school.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.555
I gave up an NFL contract
to come here.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.252
Could've paid off
my mom's mortgage,

18:43.296 --> 18:45.385
put my little brother
through school.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.518
My family relies on me
financially, if I fail out--

18:48.562 --> 18:52.653
- Whoa, you are getting way
ahead of yourself.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.136
You keep at this,
you'll get better.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.747
Now do it again.

19:07.450 --> 19:11.193
- Get a grip on yourself
or it'll be Gabby who suffers.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.593
Dr. Charles, my wife--

19:19.636 --> 19:22.596
This whole thing has been
really hard on her.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.859
She and Gabby haven't spent
more than a night apart

19:24.902 --> 19:26.382
since the day we adopted her.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.385
- I imagine it's incredibly
hard on both of you. Right?

19:29.429 --> 19:32.693
I mean, the stress,
emotion's got to run high.

19:32.736 --> 19:36.914
We all say things,
do things we regret. Right?

19:36.958 --> 19:39.352
Look, not for nothing,
I'm here.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.528
You want to talk
about anything?

19:41.571 --> 19:43.399
Anything at all?

19:43.443 --> 19:46.794
You make a good point.
I should find Jeanette.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.144
I--I owe her an apology.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.939
- It was negative.
- Oh, that's good.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.203
Look, I've been thinking.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.813
Why don't we see
if we can get a look

20:05.856 --> 20:07.989
at Gabby's adoption records?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.382
Sometimes courts
will unseal them

20:09.425 --> 20:12.080
in the case
of imminent medical need.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.603
- But didn't the parents
say Gabby's a ward

20:13.647 --> 20:15.475
of the state
with no surviving relatives?

20:15.518 --> 20:18.086
- Yeah, but at this point,
I'm pretty sure

20:18.129 --> 20:20.741
there's something
they're not telling us.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.221
- I'll make the call.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.963
- I spoke with
an immigration attorney.

20:26.007 --> 20:29.315
Under provisions in the
Violence Against Women Act,

20:29.358 --> 20:32.622
battered immigrant spouses
can self-petition

20:32.666 --> 20:34.233
for legal residency.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.582
- Without their spouse's
knowledge?

20:35.625 --> 20:38.715
- Yes and if Mrs. Carson's
petition is approved,

20:38.759 --> 20:41.370
she'll be eligible
to work in the US.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.633
- Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.
I'll go speak with Daria.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.331
- All rightie.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.773
- He goes for food,
but he comes back soon.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.515
- I only need a second.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.822
Daria, there is a way for
you to stay in this country

20:58.866 --> 21:00.041
without Adam's help.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.434
You can even get a work visa.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.784
- But if Adam finds out--
- That's the thing.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.829
He won't find out.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.309
- Dr. Manning.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.399
- I was just checking
on Daria.

21:10.443 --> 21:11.792
- You know, I was thinking,

21:11.835 --> 21:13.184
if we're just going
to watch and wait,

21:13.228 --> 21:14.838
we may as well go home.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.276
You'd be more comfortable
there. Right, babe?

21:19.626 --> 21:22.455
Babe?
- Mr. Carson,

21:22.498 --> 21:23.717
I don't think you understand

21:23.760 --> 21:26.328
the gravity
of your wife's situation.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.895
We're not just watching
and waiting.

21:27.938 --> 21:31.028
It is imperative that Daria
remain in the hospital.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.465
- That's your opinion.

21:32.508 --> 21:35.076
- Yes, my medical opinion.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.905
- We'd like to be discharged.

21:39.776 --> 21:42.170
- No. That would be against
medical advice.

21:42.213 --> 21:44.172
- So we've been told.
It's fine.

21:44.215 --> 21:48.437
- Well, that's not up to you.
That's the patient's decision.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.527
- Tell them you want to leave.

21:53.050 --> 21:56.184
- Daria, you do realize that
if you leave the hospital

21:56.227 --> 21:57.838
in your condition,

21:57.881 --> 22:01.015
you will be exposing yourself
to significant health risks?

22:01.058 --> 22:04.584
- Yes. I want to go.
Please.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.587
- Okay then.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.241
- We'll get
the paperwork started.

22:17.727 --> 22:20.208
Goodwin found Daria
a legal fix for the long-term,

22:20.251 --> 22:21.905
but if she walks out
that door with him--

22:21.949 --> 22:25.344
- It won't matter. Next time
he hits her, it'll kill her.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.611
- Hey, got your page.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.874
- Just heard back. We can't
get Gabby's adoption records.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.530
- Because they don't exist.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.576
- Okay, so the state made
a clerical error

22:40.620 --> 22:42.578
or they lost
our adoption records.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.711
I fail to understand
how this is our fault.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.713
- No one was blaming you.
- Then what were you doing

22:46.756 --> 22:48.932
going behind our backs without
our consent in the first place?

22:48.976 --> 22:50.717
- Mr. Philips,
please just try to stay calm.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.415
- Jeanette, you asked me before
if an addict can donate.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.808
- Leave my wife alone!

22:54.851 --> 22:56.897
- I need you to know that
if they're clean now,

22:56.940 --> 22:58.377
they very well could.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.341
- I know how much you both
love your daughter.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.864
But if you're
withholding information

23:07.908 --> 23:10.563
that could help us
save her life,

23:10.606 --> 23:13.304
now is absolutely
the time to tell us.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.748
- We--we had to do something,

23:21.791 --> 23:24.794
we couldn't
just leave her there.

23:24.838 --> 23:29.451
Gabby was, um, just a baby.
She wasn't even a year old.

23:29.495 --> 23:33.455
And she'd leave her out in the
hallway for hours in this, uh,

23:33.499 --> 23:36.066
ratty old bassinet.

23:36.110 --> 23:40.157
Um, we could hear her wailing
from our apartment.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.815
- That woman. The mother.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.690
She was inside getting high,

23:50.733 --> 23:53.170
getting strung out
on who--who knows what.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.563
- We were just going to take
her up to our apartment

23:54.607 --> 23:56.130
for a night, I swear.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.653
Give her a bath,
get her fed.

24:00.569 --> 24:03.877
- No, it's--it's not like that.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.011
We had to save her.

24:15.758 --> 24:19.022
- I'm sorry, but you know
we have to report this.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.417
- We know.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.507
Look, um--

24:25.551 --> 24:28.336
Could we have a moment
with Gabby?

24:28.379 --> 24:30.512
To try to explain?

24:30.556 --> 24:33.863
Of course.
- I'm--I'm sorry.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.867
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24:37.911 --> 24:41.001
- Shh, it's okay.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.959
It's going to be okay.

24:45.005 --> 24:48.138
- Pressure just dropped.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.836
- No pulse. He's in V-fib.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.402
Why did he arrest?

24:51.446 --> 24:53.100
- Don't know yet.
What were his last labs?

24:53.143 --> 24:56.320
- PH was 7.1,
but we've been correcting it.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.366
- Take over. Charge to 200.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.934
- Charging.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.152
And clear.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.200
- Lab just called with
a critical value.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.680
Potassium is 9.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.204
- All right,
two amps of bicarb, amp of D50,

25:10.247 --> 25:11.553
and charge to 200 again.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.599
- Why the hell's
his potassium so high?

25:15.122 --> 25:17.994
- Bicarb's in.
- Clear.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.088
- He's back to sinus rhythm.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.090
- Well, your shunt
must've failed.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.920
- There's no bleeding.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.098
Strong pulse in the right foot.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.538
- Damn it.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.500
- No pulse in the left foot.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.589
Compartments are
hard as a rock.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.722
The line in the artery
must've thrombosed the leg.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.985
- The line I put in.
- The muscle's dying

25:52.028 --> 25:54.509
and dumping potassium into
the bloodstream.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.902
The leg's gotta go.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.599
- You're going to amputate
his good leg?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.209
- We don't have a choice.

26:08.349 --> 26:08.567
.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.612
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
What are you doing?

26:10.656 --> 26:12.309
- We got to book an OR.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.007
- No, I mean what are you doing
sawing off this guy's leg?

26:14.050 --> 26:15.661
- It's going
to keep dumping potassium

26:15.704 --> 26:17.358
and stopping his heart.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.012
- Even if you take off the leg
and he stops arresting,

26:19.055 --> 26:20.491
he's never waking up.
- You don't know that.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.015
- His pupils were sluggish
when he got here.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.669
He already lost a massive
amount of blood.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.105
- You're saying he suffered
an anoxic injury

26:25.148 --> 26:26.933
in the field?
- Of course he did.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.499
The guy was a goner
when he got here.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.937
He's on his way to brain
death no matter what we do.

26:34.331 --> 26:35.681
- Unbelievable.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.857
You're worried

26:37.900 --> 26:40.381
that he might just
pull through, aren't you?

26:40.424 --> 26:43.123
- You're reaching.
No way he's pulling through.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.428
- Oh, that's what you're
counting on, right?

26:44.472 --> 26:46.039
That he dies?

26:46.082 --> 26:48.781
- Dr. Lanik is worried
about a malpractice suit.

26:48.824 --> 26:51.566
The patient survives,
he's accountable.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.003
Guy wakes up, he's going
to wonder why we amputated

26:54.047 --> 26:56.136
his good leg, right?

26:57.180 --> 26:59.182
You're a coward.
- Get over yourself.

26:59.226 --> 27:02.708
All you're doing is rearranging
deck chairs on the Titanic.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.840
- As long as this guy has
a fighting chance,

27:04.884 --> 27:07.408
I am going to do everything
I can to save him.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.323
The leg comes off.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.934
- You know,
it's not just my neck

27:11.978 --> 27:13.762
on the chopping block.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.678
He put the line in.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.201
So if I take a hit,

27:18.245 --> 27:20.769
you can be sure as hell
the kid goes down too.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.956
More paperwork for me
to fill out?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.697
- Given the high risk
associated

27:35.741 --> 27:37.177
with discharging Daria--

27:37.220 --> 27:38.744
- The hospital's Ethics
Committee is convening

27:38.787 --> 27:41.529
an emergency meeting.
- You got to be kidding me.

27:41.572 --> 27:45.098
I know my rights. You can't
keep us here against our will.

27:45.141 --> 27:48.057
- Dr. Manning, Dr. Halstead.
I need you. It's Daria.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.151
No pulse.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.544
- The aneurysm
must've ruptured.

27:56.587 --> 27:57.763
- She was fine a second ago.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.721
- Maggie, start bagging.
- Got you.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.244
- She's asystolic.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.464
- Do something.
You're--you're not helping her.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.771
- Step outside. Now.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.424
- Milligram of Epi.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.215
- Epi's in.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.481
- Another milligram of Epi.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.484
Stay with me Daria,
stay with me.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.051
Pulse?

28:26.835 --> 28:28.837
Epi.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.360
Come on, Daria.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.366
- No.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.543
She's gone.

28:44.940 --> 28:47.116
Time of death, 17:32.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.483
- The birth mom,
Alyssa Thompson,

29:06.527 --> 29:07.702
is on her way in.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.008
We were able to track her down
with the info

29:09.051 --> 29:10.357
the Phillips provided.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.967
- Seems like it.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.490
Been working as a hotel maid
for the past 6 years.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.014
- Good. Hopefully, she'll be
willing to get tested

29:15.057 --> 29:16.319
to be a donor.
- Yeah.

29:16.363 --> 29:17.668
Nearly had a heart attack
when we told her

29:17.712 --> 29:19.496
we found her daughter.

29:23.631 --> 29:26.242
- What's--

29:27.287 --> 29:29.419
I'm going to need you
to come with me.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.553
- Wait, wait--no.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.685
- We're so sorry, baby.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.862
- No, please. Please.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.473
We have no choice.
- So sorry.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.736
Can you--

29:41.780 --> 29:43.912
- Please forgive us.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.221
- I--I know this is
very scary--

29:48.264 --> 29:50.440
- This is all of your fault.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.582
- Mr. Carson,
we're sorry for your loss.

30:03.323 --> 30:05.238
What sort of arrangements
do I have to make?

30:05.281 --> 30:07.196
- After the autopsy
is complete,

30:07.240 --> 30:08.894
likely in about 6-8 weeks,

30:08.937 --> 30:10.330
you could--

30:10.373 --> 30:12.462
- Yes, it's the law that
all traumatic deaths

30:12.506 --> 30:15.074
go for an autopsy to determine
the cause of death.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.554
- But we already know
what happened.

30:17.598 --> 30:20.079
- Well, the crash is
the presumed cause of death.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.168
The medical examiner
will need to rule out

30:22.211 --> 30:24.474
other possibilities.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.737
- There was bruising
in her initial exam

30:26.781 --> 30:28.914
that is not consistent with
the mechanism of injury

30:28.957 --> 30:30.916
from the crash.

30:30.959 --> 30:33.092
- Daria wouldn't have wanted
an autopsy.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.312
People poking and prodding
her body.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.447
As her next of kin,
I refuse.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.276
- The ME has jurisdiction
to perform the autopsy

30:43.319 --> 30:45.104
with or without your consent.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.236
But feel free to voice
your objections directly.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.977
She'll be here
to take your statement shortly.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.283
- You can wait here.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.198
We'll retrieve you
when she arrives.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.468
- Oh, he's worried.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.256
- Just what we expected.

31:18.920 --> 31:23.185
Daria.
Daria, it's okay.

31:24.621 --> 31:28.147
He will not come back?

31:28.190 --> 31:29.713
- No, trust me.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.585
He's going to stay as far away
from this hospital

31:31.628 --> 31:33.674
as he possibly can.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.816
- We know this was
an unorthodox intervention.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.427
- No, Dr. Manning,

31:47.470 --> 31:50.909
this was a complete
misappropriation

31:50.952 --> 31:52.171
of medical care.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.129
What if your fake code
had caused

31:54.173 --> 31:55.739
the patient to rupture?

31:55.783 --> 31:57.959
- The compressions were staged.
I wasn't using full force.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.309
- And light compressions
wouldn't spike blood pressure--

32:00.353 --> 32:02.268
-Save it, Dr. Halstead.

32:02.311 --> 32:05.314
If Carson hadn't bought
your little charade,

32:05.358 --> 32:08.796
do you have any idea
of the legal ramifications?

32:08.839 --> 32:11.930
He would've gone after
your medical licenses

32:11.973 --> 32:14.715
and then you pulled Maggie in.

32:14.758 --> 32:18.893
I can't believe she allowed
herself to be involved.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.591
- Ms. Goodwin,

32:21.635 --> 32:24.333
if we could've stayed within
the lines, we would have.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.161
But in this instance,
that would have meant

32:26.205 --> 32:28.076
sending a woman out the door

32:28.120 --> 32:29.948
knowing she would
very possibly die.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.514
- Enough.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.429
Another stunt like this

32:33.473 --> 32:36.867
and both of you will be looking
for work elsewhere.

32:41.568 --> 32:44.745
And just so you know,

32:44.788 --> 32:47.400
an immigration attorney
is meeting with Mrs. Carson

32:47.443 --> 32:51.056
shortly and a social worker
is standing by

32:51.099 --> 32:53.362
to find a shelter for her.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.886
- Thank you.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.587
- Dr. Rhodes.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.200
BP and heart rate
suddenly spiked.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.246
- Now he's bradycardic.

33:10.771 --> 33:13.469
Both pupils
are blown bilaterally.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.911
No corneal.

33:22.304 --> 33:23.958
No gag.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.439
We'll need an apnea test
to confirm, but it appears--

33:26.482 --> 33:28.397
- He's brain dead.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.573
Herniated due to
an anoxic brain injury

33:30.617 --> 33:33.881
from prolonged downtime
in the field.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.492
Just like I said he would.

33:36.536 --> 33:39.930
You should be happy.
Dodged that bullet.

33:47.808 --> 33:50.767
- From now on,
you'll stay out of my way.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.378
- Likewise.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.344
- She goes by Gabby now.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.391
- I can't believe...

34:05.434 --> 34:09.308
All these years
I thought she was dead.

34:11.353 --> 34:14.661
- Yes.

34:15.531 --> 34:20.058
- Uh, Gabby,
I think you have a visitor.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.668
Alyssa is here.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.541
- Hi.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.327
I'm so happy to see you.

34:29.545 --> 34:32.679
You are so beautiful.
- Get away from me.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.857
You're not my momma.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.467
- Gabby, I know this
is confusing.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.947
- I want her out of here.
I don't care.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.298
- I'm not here to hurt you.
- Get out.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.952
Get out!

34:54.179 --> 34:58.096
- I get it.
I wouldn't expect her to,,,

35:00.185 --> 35:02.578
But I just thank God that
I get a second chance

35:02.622 --> 35:05.494
to be in her life
in some way.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.801
To be some kind of mother.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.629
- Thank you for agreeing
to get tested.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.674
- Anything. Anything she needs.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.373
- If you follow me,
I'll get you started.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.507
- Excuse me.
The couple that took her.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.248
Where are they?

35:20.292 --> 35:22.076
- They're in police custody.

35:23.382 --> 35:26.385
- I was hoping I may be able
to thank them.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.563
They saved her life.

35:38.310 --> 35:41.226
- "Thank them," wow.

35:41.269 --> 35:44.620
- Motherhood, you know.
Mysterious powerful thing.

35:44.664 --> 35:48.755
Something you and me
will never fully understand.

35:51.845 --> 35:54.413
- We took a huge risk today.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.637
- No regrets.
I'd do it again.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.076
Aren't you forgetting
something?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.687
Your sash.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.429
- Do you really think
she'll notice?

36:14.302 --> 36:15.912
- Nat, it's Maggie.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.610
- Fine, but I am
not putting it on

36:17.653 --> 36:19.873
until we're out
of the hospital.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.614
- All right.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.148
- Okay, I'll be right back.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.460
I don't need
another lecture right now.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.505
- And I'm not here to do that.

36:43.549 --> 36:45.899
- Listen, Em,

36:45.942 --> 36:48.380
I may not understand your
decision to stay with Bernie,

36:48.423 --> 36:52.079
but I'm not in your shoes

36:52.122 --> 36:54.821
and you need to do what
you think is best.

36:56.475 --> 36:59.782
- Yeah.

36:59.826 --> 37:02.176
- I'm so glad to hear that.

37:02.220 --> 37:06.441
I have some news.
Kind of big news.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.138
- Okay.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.840
- As soon as Bernie's
discharged,

37:13.883 --> 37:16.146
we're going to move
to Las Vegas.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.023
- Okay, Em.

37:24.633 --> 37:25.939
- Okay.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.992
Awesome. Okay.

37:57.884 --> 38:00.190
- First one's the hardest.

38:01.975 --> 38:05.021
- You didn't cause his death,
you know that, right?

38:05.065 --> 38:06.588
- That's not it.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.857
When Mitch died
for a moment,

38:14.901 --> 38:18.513
for a split second...

38:18.557 --> 38:21.255
I was relieved to be
in the clear.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.173
- You're human.

38:28.044 --> 38:32.310
Now, look, the minute that
you walk into this hospital,

38:32.353 --> 38:36.270
the only person relying on you
needs to be your patient.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.881
This is already
a high-pressured gig

38:38.925 --> 38:40.840
and you need to find a way
to leave everything else

38:40.883 --> 38:43.669
at the door.
You got me?

38:43.712 --> 38:45.671
- I hear you.

38:47.934 --> 38:49.849
Thanks, Dr. Rhodes.

38:57.987 --> 39:01.817
- You hang in there, Terry.
You're going to be fine.

39:08.781 --> 39:11.349
Arr, matey.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.222
You clean up nice,
Dr. Bekker.

39:15.265 --> 39:18.399
- You're not so bad yourself.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.927
♪

39:24.971 --> 39:27.234
- Thanks for coming.

39:27.277 --> 39:34.328
♪

39:46.166 --> 39:48.342
- I'll go get us
another round.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.344
- All right.

39:50.388 --> 39:57.395
♪

39:58.613 --> 40:00.615
- Hey, can I talk to you
for a quick sec?

40:00.659 --> 40:02.356
- Yeah, sure.

40:08.362 --> 40:11.452
- I'm just giving you
a heads up, out of respect.

40:11.496 --> 40:13.236
- Okay.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.717
- I'm bringing Ray Burke in
for an echo and an MRI--

40:15.761 --> 40:17.980
- Jesus, Will,
you're not his doctor.

40:18.024 --> 40:19.939
- And I can't, in good
conscience, withhold possibly

40:19.982 --> 40:21.506
life-threatening information
from him.

40:21.549 --> 40:24.204
- If you make a move in his
direction without our go-ahead,

40:24.247 --> 40:26.859
I promise you,
you will regret it.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.991
- Look, man, because of the bug
that you planted,

40:29.035 --> 40:30.340
the Task Force has intel

40:30.384 --> 40:33.039
that Ray's meeting with
his crew in a week.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.345
Okay, this close
to taking him down.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.913
He'll get treated in custody.

40:37.957 --> 40:41.395
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
like to get back to your party.
