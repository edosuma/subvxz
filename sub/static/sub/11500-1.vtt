00:40.915 --> 00:42.875
The la Drang Valley
of Vietnam,

00:43.710 --> 00:46.086
a place our country does not remember,

00:46.171 --> 00:48.213
in a war it does not understand.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.217
This story is a testament
to the young Americans

00:52.302 --> 00:53.552
who died in the Valley of Death

00:53.636 --> 00:56.597
and a tribute to the young men
of the People's Army of Vietnam

00:56.681 --> 00:59.183
who died by our hand in that place.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.897
To tell this story,
I must start at the beginning.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.400
But where does it begin?

01:11.196 --> 01:14.740
Maybe in June of 1954,
when French Group Mobile 100

01:14.783 --> 01:17.659
moved into the same
Central Highlands of Vietnam,

01:18.036 --> 01:20.120
where we would go 11 years later.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.716
Maybe the story
begins in America

04:20.843 --> 04:24.680
when the Army first realized
a new kind of war was coming its way.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.516
The White House anticipates a buildup
and wants a victory

04:27.600 --> 04:29.309
over cavemen in black pajamas.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.937
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't
already beaten the French Army.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.856
The French Army? What's that?

04:34.941 --> 04:38.277
The problem in Vietnam is terrain.
Jungles, mountains, rivers.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.569
Maneuver's a nightmare.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.863
That's why we came up with a plan
to use helicopters,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.282
leap in and out of battle.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.284
They want you
to run the test on the idea.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.786
It'll take a hell of a combat leader.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.622
I know a young light colonel
named Hal Moore.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.457
He led a combat company in Korea.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.127
After that, he volunteered
to test experimental parachutes.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.672
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.717
The other side
of the mountain

05:01.801 --> 05:03.635
Was all that he could see

05:03.720 --> 05:07.681
Was all that he could see
Was all that he could see

05:07.765 --> 05:10.600
The other side of the mountain

05:10.643 --> 05:12.853
Was all that he could see

05:12.937 --> 05:14.938
The bear went over the mountain

05:18.192 --> 05:21.820
How about we go back to Bingo?
What do you say? Bingo.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.073
B-I-N-G-O

05:25.158 --> 05:26.825
B-I-N-G-O

05:28.828 --> 05:30.996
And Bingo was his name-o

05:48.848 --> 05:52.225
Tom, how much you know
about our new colonel?

05:52.602 --> 05:53.852
He was in Korea,

05:53.936 --> 05:56.521
has a master's
in International Relations from Harvard.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.939
Harvard?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.941
He's not one of those
academic pussies, is he?

06:00.026 --> 06:01.151
Hal Moore?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.028
Want me to get one of those?

06:54.414 --> 06:57.666
Come on, Too Tall.
Give me your best shot!

06:59.585 --> 07:03.088
Did you see that, sports fans?
Did you see that?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.841
Snakeshit drives that one
to the moon, baby!

07:05.925 --> 07:08.385
Hit the cutoff man! Hit the cutoff man!

07:08.428 --> 07:09.928
And he's coming around!

07:10.012 --> 07:11.555
Here he comes!

07:11.597 --> 07:13.098
No, he's not.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.771
You're out, Snakeshit! You're out!

07:19.856 --> 07:23.233
Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly.
You can't see.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.945
I believe you're out.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.955
- You're a pilot?
- Too Tall, sir.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.958
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You call, we haul.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.297
- Can I speak to you a minute, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.134
- Out.
- Safe.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.804
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.306
Thanks.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.601
So, your men call you "Snakeshit. "

07:57.643 --> 08:01.354
That's an affectionate appellation
of my comrades-in-arms, sir,

08:01.439 --> 08:03.523
'cause I fly lower than snake shit.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.319
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit,
and I think you're the solution.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.197
I've been called a lot of things, Colonel,
never a solution.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.824
You know what air cavalry
really means?

08:12.909 --> 08:17.204
You fly into hostile territory,
outnumbered, 10,000 miles from home.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.664
Sometimes the battleground's
no bigger than a football field.

08:19.707 --> 08:23.293
And if the choppers stop coming,
we all get slaughtered.

08:23.961 --> 08:27.172
Now, I figure chopper pilots
won't fly into hell for strangers,

08:27.215 --> 08:29.508
so, I'm Hal Moore.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.843
I know, sir. Why us?

08:32.720 --> 08:37.097
Well, you guys look like shit,
but your equipment is immaculate.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.019
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't
have to be training, but you were.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.395
And you got pilots
like that Too Tall character.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.857
He's way outside the limits
of army regs.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.527
They wanna fly with you
for some reason.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.112
I guess it's 'cause they think
you're the best.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.823
It's 'cause I only recruit
the dumb ones, sir.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.829
I don't suppose
I have a choice in all this.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.289
You sure don't.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.377
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.962
To the Air Cav.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.888
Good morning, Sergeant Major.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.933
How do you know
what kind of goddamn day it is?

09:27.567 --> 09:31.027
Group! Atten-hut!

09:55.469 --> 09:57.178
At ease, gentlemen.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.266
Welcome to the new cavalry.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.728
We will ride into battle.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.607
And this will be our horse.

10:33.841 --> 10:37.177
You don't have to catch it.
You don't have to feed it.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.430
But I can assure you

10:41.474 --> 10:45.977
that neither the new technology
nor your status as officers

10:46.646 --> 10:48.647
will keep you above the danger.

10:50.441 --> 10:53.401
Sergeant Major Plumley and I
come from the paratroopers

10:53.486 --> 10:57.072
where the officer is always
the first one out of the plane.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.200
Because to follow your instincts

11:00.284 --> 11:03.203
and to inspire your men
by your example,

11:04.830 --> 11:08.083
you have to be with them
where the metal meets the meat.

11:10.044 --> 11:13.004
Sergeant Major Plumley
made all four combat jumps

11:13.089 --> 11:15.340
in the 82nd Airborne
during World War II.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.426
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy and Holland,

11:18.886 --> 11:20.762
plus one more in Korea.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.517
He answers to me and to me alone.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.853
Now, I hope you gentlemen like training,

11:29.105 --> 11:31.439
'cause me and the Sergeant Major,

11:32.441 --> 11:33.608
we love it.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.572
Three strikes and you're not out!

11:40.074 --> 11:42.826
There is always one more thing
you can do!

11:54.213 --> 11:55.630
Here we go, boys.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.966
Move! Move! Go! Now!

11:58.050 --> 11:59.551
- Two.
- Let's go!

12:00.094 --> 12:01.261
Three.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.304
We're out of here!

12:04.765 --> 12:06.808
- Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.895
There's only one thing wrong.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.567
Be sharp, men! We will be
the best platoon in this battalion!

12:15.776 --> 12:18.236
Be ready in there! Let's go! Let's go!

12:18.279 --> 12:20.405
All right! Your officer's dead!

12:20.448 --> 12:22.657
- What do you do? What do you do?
- First...

12:22.742 --> 12:25.660
All right, he hesitated. He's dead.
What do you do?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.371
- Get off the chopper!
- Get off of the chopper.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.965
All right, hold off the third one.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.592
Come on in.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.095
Savage, you learn the job
of the man above you

12:44.138 --> 12:47.015
and you teach your job
to the man below you in rank.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.017
That goes for every man in this outfit.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.685
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

12:50.770 --> 12:53.271
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.276
Men will die.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.785
Have you said your prayers?

13:07.453 --> 13:08.787
- No?
- No.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.914
Come on. I'll say them with you.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.792
- Fall in.
- Give me that bear.

13:13.876 --> 13:14.876
No.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.339
All right. Ready. Set.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.467
In the name of the Father,
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.970
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.806
Blessed art thou amongst women

13:27.848 --> 13:29.849
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.435
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

13:32.478 --> 13:34.896
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.776
I don't wanna be a Catholic.
I wanna be a "Nethodist" like Mommy.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.152
You do?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.030
And why is that, honey?

13:44.114 --> 13:46.157
So I can pray whatever I want.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.159
That's a sin.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.286
No, no, no, no, that's not a sin.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.540
God just made you hardheaded.
It's not a sin.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.168
I'll tell you what. You wanna...

13:57.211 --> 13:59.712
You wanna pray
and thank God for our family?

14:00.506 --> 14:03.341
- Yes, sir.
- That's good. Well, then, let's do it.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.762
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.931
Blessed art thou among women

14:10.015 --> 14:12.517
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.149
I can hear you laughing,
you know, even in here.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.569
I'm not laughing, I'm marveling.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.154
Marveling? At what?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.907
That you can find stubbornness
in your children

14:27.992 --> 14:30.368
and think it comes
from anybody but you.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.786
Yeah?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.875
I'll give you something to marvel at.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.422
He's a wild man.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.275
When I pray

15:03.485 --> 15:04.903
whatever I want,

15:06.280 --> 15:08.072
I thank God for you.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.589
Beautiful morning, Sergeant Major.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.091
What are you,
a fucking weatherman now?

15:30.220 --> 15:32.889
Look what I found
for the new baseball player.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.642
Sent us
another bunch of officers.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.102
Real green. Got to train them up.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.605
Makes me think I'm starting a new unit.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.941
They sent new rifles, too. The M-16.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.859
That's supposed to be
a pretty good weapon.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.861
Lots of plastic.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.865
Feels like a BB gun to me.
Believe I'll stick with my pistol.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.535
You think we're gonna get close enough
to the enemy to use that?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.162
What do you think, sir?

15:57.122 --> 16:00.208
A leader must remain cool and calm
and thinking.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.461
He must learn to ignore explosions,

16:03.504 --> 16:06.798
the heat and dust,
the screams of the wounded.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.468
This is normal on a battlefield. Normal!

16:24.608 --> 16:26.734
Colonel Tran,
you need to get a company over

16:26.819 --> 16:28.319
to reinforce the left flank.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.698
- Where the hell is that coming from?
- That's our advisors in Vietnam.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.409
The new radio's picking up
atmospheric bounce.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.887
When Crazy Horse was a baby,

16:59.059 --> 17:02.311
he nursed from the breast
of every woman in the tribe.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.400
The Sioux raised their children that way.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.652
Every warrior

17:10.654 --> 17:13.031
called every woman
in the tribe "Mother. "

17:13.741 --> 17:16.617
Every older warrior,
they called him "Grandfather. "

17:17.036 --> 17:19.912
Now, the point here is
that they fought as a family.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.874
Take care of your men.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.294
Teach them to take care of each other.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.963
'Cause when this starts,

17:31.091 --> 17:33.259
each other is all we're gonna have.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.143
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.729
Well, that's fine.
You're my radio operator.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.232
You'll be fine. You'll work it out.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.409
Any of you sons of bitches
calls me Grandpa,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.246
I'll kill you.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.438
Godboldt,
take your boots off.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.233
Go on.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.529
Everybody, take your boots off.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.448
Everybody. Socks, too.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.132
I want you to draw
fresh socks from supply.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.342
Keep your feet dusted with powder.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.808
Everybody check each other's feet
like Godboldt and me.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.521
- Now, that young man's a leader.
- Yes, sir.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.650
That other fella,
that big, strong one there,

19:12.693 --> 19:14.610
he wants to win medals.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.615
Why the hell are you in the back?

19:19.658 --> 19:21.951
Goddamn it, why are you in the back?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.328
He's eager.

19:27.374 --> 19:31.127
Ladies, I'm just really, really glad
you're here today.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.629
I know that some of you
are new to the Army

19:33.672 --> 19:36.007
and all of us are new to this post,

19:36.091 --> 19:38.176
so I thought we could
pool our resources

19:38.260 --> 19:40.303
and cover whatever questions
we might have.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.764
So why don't we start
with item number one, food.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.185
If the commissary is out of something,
where's the best place to shop?

19:48.937 --> 19:50.855
Well, I tried Big Star, and it's okay.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.483
But I keep thinking my water's
gonna break right in the checkout aisle.

19:57.362 --> 20:01.365
That takes care of food shopping.
So item number two, laundry.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.576
The base washing machines don't work.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.286
They're full of sand
from the swamp missions.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.954
All right, I'll take care of that.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.249
- I've already complained.
- Well, we'll just go to the General.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.337
In the meantime,
the laundromat in town's okay,

20:14.379 --> 20:17.089
but they won't let you wash
your colored things in their machines.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.508
- At a public laundromat?
- Didn't make sense to me either.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.053
But I'm telling you,
they have a big sign right in the window

20:22.095 --> 20:23.763
says "Whites Only. "

20:26.558 --> 20:30.102
- What?
- Honey, they mean white people only.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.564
That's awful.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.818
Your husband is wearing the uniform
of a country that allows a place

20:38.612 --> 20:42.490
to say that his laundry's not
good enough, when he could die for...

20:47.871 --> 20:50.289
- I'm sorry. I just...
- That's all right, honey.

20:50.374 --> 20:54.043
But I know what my husband's
fighting for, and that's why I can smile.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.380
My husband will never ask for respect,

20:57.714 --> 21:00.007
and he'll give respect to no man
who hasn't earned it.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.176
The rest of his family is the same way.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.803
And anybody who doesn't respect that

21:03.887 --> 21:05.554
can keep his
goddamn washing machine

21:05.597 --> 21:07.682
'cause my baby's clothes
are gonna be clean anyway.

21:10.477 --> 21:13.312
Well, I guess that takes care
of item number two.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.485
Are you all right?

21:19.569 --> 21:21.779
I think... I think my water just broke.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.364
Okay. Okay!

21:23.448 --> 21:25.616
We're all calm. We're all calm.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.577
A car! A car!

22:01.987 --> 22:03.988
- Colonel.
- At ease. At ease.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.449
I heard one of my new lieutenants
just became a father.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.993
- I came to say congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.162
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.040
No, no, it's fine. It's all right. Please.

22:14.958 --> 22:19.003
- Well, how's your wife?
- She's okay. She's okay. She's sleeping.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.547
So is my daughter.

22:21.631 --> 22:25.384
I just wanted to be here for a while
before I held her.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.304
Well, tag her already? What's that say?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.056
Camille. Yeah, I'm sorry about this, sir.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.350
No, don't you take that off.
You leave that on where it is.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.392
That's an order.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.688
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.903
What do you think about
being a soldier and a father?

22:45.364 --> 22:49.283
I hope that being good at the one
makes me better at the other.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.246
Why? What about you?

22:55.457 --> 22:57.124
I don't know, sir.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.543
Between college and here,

23:00.712 --> 23:03.005
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.968
We helped build a school for orphans.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.390
They were orphans
because the warlord across the border

23:12.432 --> 23:14.392
didn't like their tribe.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.606
I know God has a plan for me.

23:22.401 --> 23:25.236
I just hope it's to help protect orphans,

23:26.363 --> 23:27.988
not make any.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.744
Well, why don't we ask him?

23:35.205 --> 23:37.123
Come on. Let's go ask him.

23:41.711 --> 23:45.089
Our Father in heaven,
before we go into battle,

23:45.590 --> 23:49.093
every soldier among us
will approach you, each in his own way.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.764
Our enemies, too,
according to their own understanding,

23:53.807 --> 23:56.225
will ask for protection and for victory.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.770
And so we bow
before your infinite wisdom.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.273
We offer our prayers as best we can.

24:03.150 --> 24:07.153
I pray you watch over the young men,
like Jack Geoghegan,

24:07.237 --> 24:08.946
that I lead into battle.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.783
You use me as your instrument
in this awful hell of war

24:12.826 --> 24:14.368
to watch over them.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.205
Especially if they're men
like this one beside me

24:18.290 --> 24:21.333
deserving of a future
in your blessing and good will.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.671
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.885
Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.386
About our enemies,

24:34.473 --> 24:36.098
ignore their heathen prayers

24:36.141 --> 24:38.809
and help us blow
those little bastards straight to hell.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.186
Amen again.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.397
Amen.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.483
Thank you.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.865
There's one about the kid
with the apple tree, or the flying horse,

24:52.949 --> 24:55.493
or the fairy tales
with the deer and stuff in them.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.370
Daddy, what is a war?

25:03.460 --> 25:05.461
Awar is a...

25:05.504 --> 25:07.004
Well, it's...

25:10.759 --> 25:15.012
It's something that shouldn't happen,
but it does.

25:15.764 --> 25:18.140
And it's when

25:19.267 --> 25:23.479
some people in another country
or any country

25:24.481 --> 25:27.358
try to take the lives of other people.

25:28.276 --> 25:31.028
And then soldiers like your daddy
have to, you know...

25:31.112 --> 25:33.239
It's my job to go over there
and stop them.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.536
Are they gonna try
to take your life away, Daddy?

25:43.124 --> 25:45.584
Well, yes, Cecile, they're gonna try.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.087
But I'm not gonna let them.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.006
Okay?

26:55.447 --> 26:56.822
Can't sleep?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.491
No.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.246
The men are so young,

27:04.789 --> 27:07.458
and now they sent me a new crop
even greener.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.294
When I look at them,

27:10.337 --> 27:12.963
I see our boys.

27:14.090 --> 27:16.634
Well, then you're just the man
to lead them.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.722
I guess.

27:28.688 --> 27:33.150
The Massacre

27:34.736 --> 27:37.988
We intend to convince the Communists

27:38.823 --> 27:43.369
that we cannot be defeated
by force of arms.

27:44.829 --> 27:49.208
I have asked the commanding general,
General Westmoreland,

27:50.168 --> 27:54.838
what more he needs
to meet this mounting aggression.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.800
He has told me

27:59.260 --> 28:02.012
and we will meet his needs.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.017
I have today ordered to Vietnam
the Air Mobile Division

28:07.477 --> 28:10.896
and certain other forces
which will raise our fighting strength

28:10.980 --> 28:15.484
from 75,000 to 125,000 men

28:15.819 --> 28:17.444
almost immediately.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.781
Additional forces will be needed later.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.326
Get out your best dresses, ladies.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.706
They're gonna want to celebrate.

28:39.467 --> 28:43.637
Don't you ever be sad

28:44.305 --> 28:48.225
Lean on me when the times are bad

28:51.563 --> 28:54.064
I didn't hear the President
mention a state of emergency.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.441
No, he didn't.

28:56.109 --> 28:59.695
Well, without that declaration it means
our enlistments won't be extended.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.613
I'm sorry, Hal.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.242
Forgive me, sir,
but let me get this straight.

29:05.326 --> 29:09.121
We form a division using techniques
that have never been attempted in battle

29:09.205 --> 29:13.041
against an enemy with 20 years
of combat experience on his ground

29:13.376 --> 29:15.753
12,000 miles away from our ground.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.797
And right before the Army
sends us into the fight,

29:18.882 --> 29:20.591
they take away a third of my men,

29:20.633 --> 29:22.843
the most experienced third,
including the officers.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.762
I don't like it any better than you do, Hal.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.096
Hell, no, sir.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.100
You saw this coming, didn't you?

29:30.143 --> 29:33.937
Yes. That's why you gave me
that new crop of platoon leaders.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.108
Korea didn't teach them anything.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.736
- Politicians?
- Politicians.

29:46.242 --> 29:49.620
Hold me, Hold me

29:49.662 --> 29:52.039
Never let me go

29:52.123 --> 29:56.293
Until you've told me, told me

29:56.503 --> 30:01.131
What I want to know
and then just hold me

30:01.216 --> 30:02.966
Hold me

30:03.009 --> 30:04.927
Make me tell you

30:04.969 --> 30:08.096
I'm in love with you

30:13.144 --> 30:16.146
Thrill me, thrill me

30:17.315 --> 30:18.899
Thank you, sir.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.526
By the way, Hal,

30:20.610 --> 30:23.237
since we're being deployed
they're renumbering the units.

30:23.321 --> 30:27.324
You're now the commanding officer
of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.453
The 7th.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.374
The same regiment as Custer.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.129
Thank you, sir.

30:41.172 --> 30:44.341
Be sensible with your new love

30:45.844 --> 30:47.636
Don't be fooled

30:47.679 --> 30:51.849
Thinkin' this is the last you'll find

30:52.725 --> 30:55.894
But they never stood in the dark

30:55.979 --> 30:58.480
With you, love

30:58.731 --> 31:01.984
When you take me in your arms

31:02.026 --> 31:05.988
And drive me slowly out of my mind

31:06.030 --> 31:09.032
Kiss me, kiss me

31:09.075 --> 31:10.701
And when you do

31:10.743 --> 31:13.996
I know that you will miss me

31:14.038 --> 31:15.873
Miss me

31:15.957 --> 31:18.792
If we ever say adieu

31:18.877 --> 31:22.170
So kiss me, kiss me

31:22.213 --> 31:27.009
Make me tell you I'm in love with you

32:49.175 --> 32:50.926
Look around you.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.472
In the 7th Cavalry

32:56.307 --> 32:58.767
we got a captain from the Ukraine.

33:00.269 --> 33:02.270
Another from Puerto Rico.

33:02.897 --> 33:05.774
We've got Japanese, Chinese,

33:05.817 --> 33:08.986
Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indians.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.155
Jews and Gentiles.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.658
All Americans.

33:16.452 --> 33:18.328
Now, here in the States,

33:18.788 --> 33:21.581
some men in this unit

33:22.166 --> 33:26.169
may experience discrimination
because of race or creed.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.797
But for you and me now,

33:29.924 --> 33:31.508
all that is gone.

33:32.677 --> 33:36.096
We're moving into
the valley of the shadow of death,

33:37.807 --> 33:40.851
where you will watch the back
of the man next to you

33:41.102 --> 33:43.103
as he will watch yours.

33:43.646 --> 33:46.023
And you won't care what color he is,

33:46.691 --> 33:49.192
or by what name he calls God.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.946
They say we're leaving home.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.369
We're going to what home
was always supposed to be.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.207
So let us understand the situation.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.544
We are going into battle

34:08.004 --> 34:11.339
against a tough and determined enemy.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.929
I can't promise you

34:18.556 --> 34:21.224
that I will bring you all home alive.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.103
But this I swear,

34:26.563 --> 34:29.232
before you and before Almighty God,

34:29.817 --> 34:31.735
that when we go into battle

34:33.071 --> 34:36.239
I will be the first to set foot on the field

34:37.867 --> 34:40.368
and I will be the last to step off.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.998
And I will leave no one behind.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.672
Dead or alive,

34:54.592 --> 34:56.885
we will all come home together.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.597
So help me God.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.848
I love you.

41:29.185 --> 41:30.185
- Hal.
- Sir.

41:30.228 --> 41:32.187
Last night the enemy hit our camp
at Plei Mei.

41:32.272 --> 41:34.398
- How many casualties?
- None.

41:35.149 --> 41:37.150
The enemy forces withdrew
toward this mountain

41:37.193 --> 41:38.735
near the Cambodian border.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.154
How many men do you have
battle-ready, give or take?

41:41.197 --> 41:44.074
- Sergeant Major?
- Three hundred and ninety-five, sir.

41:44.158 --> 41:45.367
Exactly.

41:45.743 --> 41:47.869
What do you estimate
the enemy strength?

41:47.912 --> 41:50.706
We appraise their numbers
as manageable, Colonel.

41:51.833 --> 41:53.417
You have no idea.

41:54.127 --> 41:56.962
We have no idea. Simple orders, Hal.

41:57.046 --> 41:59.172
Find the enemy and kill him.

42:02.302 --> 42:06.388
They attack us, no casualties.
They run and hide in the mountains.

42:06.848 --> 42:09.016
So naturally we chase them, of course.

42:10.518 --> 42:12.644
Smell like an ambush to you?

42:12.895 --> 42:16.815
They get close enough to kill us,
we'll be close enough to kill them.

42:21.070 --> 42:23.322
Round trip by chopper, 30 minutes.

42:23.573 --> 42:25.824
That means the first 60 men
on the ground

42:25.908 --> 42:27.826
will be there a half hour alone.

42:27.910 --> 42:29.453
Son of a bitch.

42:30.788 --> 42:33.582
I think maybe you ought
to get yourself that M-16.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.584
Time comes I need one, sir,

42:35.668 --> 42:38.378
there'll be plenty of them
lying on the ground.

42:43.384 --> 42:47.220
Well, let's go do
what we came here to do.

42:47.513 --> 42:48.764
Yes, sir.

43:02.612 --> 43:04.029
Garry Owen!

44:14.016 --> 44:15.517
It was a Sunday.

44:16.102 --> 44:18.937
November 14, 1965.

44:20.106 --> 44:22.441
Before that day,
the soldiers of North Vietnam

44:22.525 --> 44:24.359
and those of America

44:24.402 --> 44:26.820
had never met each other
in a major battle.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.768
Two miles out.
Dropping to map of the earth.

48:01.494 --> 48:03.536
First Platoon, let's move!

48:15.257 --> 48:16.424
This is Trojan-Two.

48:16.467 --> 48:19.302
All units maintain perimeter contact.
Over.

48:22.932 --> 48:25.725
It's a scout! Let's take him prisoner!

48:26.560 --> 48:28.561
Hey! Lieutenant!

48:29.522 --> 48:31.106
Lieutenant!

48:33.067 --> 48:34.859
There he goes! Come on!

48:39.865 --> 48:41.116
Come on!

48:41.409 --> 48:44.119
Captain, I want you to keep in contact
with all patrols.

48:44.161 --> 48:45.787
Every five minutes
I want you to update me...

48:45.871 --> 48:49.624
Hey. Hey.
Hey, I got something here. I got a boy!

48:49.709 --> 48:52.127
Boy, hell. That ain't no boy.

48:57.383 --> 49:00.051
- He say he deserter.
- Bullshit, he's a lookout.

49:00.136 --> 49:01.720
Ask him where his friends are.

49:08.686 --> 49:11.187
He say this is base camp
for whole division.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.314
- Four thousand men.
- Where?

49:19.155 --> 49:20.488
That mountain.

49:29.081 --> 49:30.915
Same army destroyed French.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.002
And he say they want kill American
very badly.

49:34.670 --> 49:36.671
Just not been able to find any yet.

49:36.756 --> 49:40.049
Captain Metsker, tell all patrols
to hold their positions.

49:48.976 --> 49:50.685
You, take the radio!

49:52.688 --> 49:56.024
- Where the hell are they?
- Sir, we gotta get that guy!

50:02.531 --> 50:04.032
Captain, you call in all the patrols.

50:04.116 --> 50:05.617
We have to regroup
and engage the enemy

50:05.701 --> 50:07.869
as far away from the LZ as possible!

50:11.373 --> 50:13.291
Net call, net call, this is Trojan-Two.

50:13.375 --> 50:15.418
Grab the wounded! Break contact!

50:16.670 --> 50:18.922
Fall back! Get to high ground!

50:19.006 --> 50:21.758
Cover fire! Get to high ground!

50:22.218 --> 50:23.593
Come on!

50:26.430 --> 50:27.931
Watch your back!

50:29.475 --> 50:30.725
Come on!

50:33.813 --> 50:36.564
Come on! Get up here!
Bring the wounded up to the middle!

50:36.649 --> 50:37.941
Move it, move it!

50:38.025 --> 50:40.109
Cover fire! Cover fire!

50:44.156 --> 50:46.533
Everybody down! Down!

50:49.620 --> 50:52.539
Check your ammo!
Everybody check ammo!

51:00.005 --> 51:02.298
Come on! I'll get us out of here!

51:03.092 --> 51:05.343
Grab the wounded! We'll make a run...

51:05.594 --> 51:08.263
- Sarge!
- We gotta get out of here!

51:09.348 --> 51:12.016
Stay down! Don't anybody move!

51:12.101 --> 51:13.726
Bungum, stay down!

51:26.574 --> 51:28.116
You're gonna be okay.

51:31.537 --> 51:32.745
Stay down.

51:33.789 --> 51:35.456
Form a perimeter!

51:35.499 --> 51:38.793
Conserve your am

51:41.213 --> 51:42.714
What's happening with those patrols?

51:42.798 --> 51:44.299
I'm trying to reach them, sir!

51:44.633 --> 51:47.302
This is Trojan-Two! Come in! Over!

51:47.344 --> 51:50.972
Hey! Hey! Calm down!

51:51.015 --> 51:54.642
Understand the situation
and communicate clearly!

51:58.689 --> 52:02.317
Pull the chain on all the firepower
you can get onto that mountain!

52:02.401 --> 52:04.986
Alert Crandall! We have a hot LZ!

52:05.070 --> 52:07.488
Agent Serpent-Six, this is Trojan-Two.

52:07.573 --> 52:10.491
You're coming
into a hot LZ. We are taking fire.

52:10.534 --> 52:12.493
Repeat. We are taking fire.

52:13.495 --> 52:15.163
No shit.

52:16.165 --> 52:18.833
This is Too Tall going down and dirty.

52:23.839 --> 52:26.007
Roger that! Trojan-Two, out!

52:26.258 --> 52:28.551
Herrick's platoon is cut off
and under attack!

52:28.636 --> 52:30.345
Bravo Company's holding!

52:31.305 --> 52:33.222
They're gonna try and flank us.

52:42.358 --> 52:44.400
On the ground now! Move!

52:46.028 --> 52:47.862
- Watch him!
- We gotta go.

52:47.947 --> 52:49.238
We're out of here.

52:49.323 --> 52:51.532
They're coming at us
from the back now!

52:51.617 --> 52:52.700
Move!

52:58.374 --> 52:59.582
Savage.

53:00.626 --> 53:01.918
Savage.

53:02.670 --> 53:04.837
All right, all right, I got you.

53:06.882 --> 53:07.966
Sir?

53:08.968 --> 53:11.469
Don't let them get the signal codes.

53:12.429 --> 53:14.263
Roger that, sir. Roger that.

53:19.728 --> 53:21.896
I'm glad I could die for my country.

53:34.410 --> 53:35.493
Doc.

53:52.761 --> 53:53.970
Bungum.

53:55.305 --> 53:56.472
Sarge?

54:02.771 --> 54:04.105
Tell my wife

54:05.441 --> 54:07.108
I love her.

54:09.695 --> 54:11.112
This is Savage.

54:11.155 --> 54:15.825
I need artillery to these coordinates,
niner-3-3-0-1.

54:18.620 --> 54:21.581
Ernie! Ernie, help!
We got more coming!

54:21.623 --> 54:24.459
We are cut off. Copy? We are cut off.

54:26.795 --> 54:31.090
- Fire!
- Fire!

54:32.676 --> 54:34.302
They're getting closer!

54:36.472 --> 54:38.848
They're getting closer!
A hundred more, sir!

54:46.732 --> 54:49.734
They're right on top of us, sir!
Bring it in close!

55:53.465 --> 55:57.260
It's a hot LZ! We'll be jumping!
We will not touch down!

56:10.399 --> 56:12.358
They're trying to break right through us!

56:12.401 --> 56:16.320
I want you to reinforce
Alpha Company there! Now! Move!

56:16.405 --> 56:19.031
Follow me!
Charlie Company, up on the ridge!

56:19.074 --> 56:22.743
Doc, the wounded are over
by that termite mound! Go!

56:22.828 --> 56:25.705
Sir, if you don't find some cover,
you're gonna go down!

56:25.747 --> 56:28.291
If you go down, we all go down!
Come on!

56:43.932 --> 56:45.224
Grenades!

56:45.434 --> 56:47.602
I want the M60 right here!

56:55.235 --> 56:56.652
Radio!

56:59.323 --> 57:01.991
Sir, it's Captain Edwards
on the ridge, sir!

57:02.784 --> 57:05.411
- Bob!
- Colonel, these guys are regulars!

57:05.454 --> 57:09.123
Heavily armed!
AK-47s and pouches of grenades!

57:09.791 --> 57:12.293
Heavy machine guns
and shoulder-fired rockets!

57:30.520 --> 57:32.063
Captain Nadal!

57:32.147 --> 57:34.899
That creek bed is vital. Vital!

57:34.983 --> 57:38.319
Now, they'll be coming right at you!
Do not let them flank!

57:38.403 --> 57:40.613
I repeat, do not let them flank!

57:40.697 --> 57:42.281
Secure the creek bed!

57:59.841 --> 58:03.052
Tom, I want you to keep trying
to raise those medevac boys.

58:12.813 --> 58:14.939
Tom. Tom.

58:15.857 --> 58:17.316
I'm all right.

58:17.359 --> 58:18.943
Charlie, come here.

58:19.861 --> 58:23.781
I want you to give me all the air support
you can get me on that mountain! Now!

58:23.865 --> 58:26.325
Requesting immediate
close air support!

58:26.368 --> 58:28.411
I need you to burn them out on hilltop

58:28.495 --> 58:32.039
Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo!

58:32.082 --> 58:36.127
Coordinates, golf-4-5-0-9!

58:51.226 --> 58:54.937
- Get me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop Bravo!

58:55.022 --> 58:58.149
Golf-4-5-7-2!

58:59.318 --> 59:02.737
I say again, 4-5-7-2!

59:15.083 --> 59:17.960
Medevac Command of the 7th Cavalry,
are you inbound?

59:18.045 --> 59:19.795
Looks
pretty hot down there.

59:19.880 --> 59:21.672
Yeah, it's a little hot.
You can make it, though.

59:21.757 --> 59:23.257
Just watch our approach, follow us in.

59:23.842 --> 59:26.635
Copy that, 7th Cav.
We will follow your approach.

59:45.113 --> 59:48.366
I want you to get over there
and reinforce Charlie Company there!

59:50.660 --> 59:53.621
Medevac, abort! Abort! This is a hot LZ!

59:53.663 --> 59:54.789
You see that?

59:54.831 --> 59:57.958
My medevac guys are
bugging out and leaving the wounded!

01:00:01.338 --> 01:00:02.713
We're going down!

01:00:12.307 --> 01:00:15.142
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring me the wounded!

01:00:15.185 --> 01:00:16.977
Wounded! Get the wounded!

01:00:17.062 --> 01:00:18.687
Come on! Come on!

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:25.653
Okay, here!

01:00:25.737 --> 01:00:28.989
They're still trying to flank us!
Stretch out along the line!

01:00:33.495 --> 01:00:34.662
Radio!

01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:42.002
Trojan-Six! We are in heavy contact!
In danger of being overrun!

01:00:42.087 --> 01:00:45.256
If they get into that LZ, we've all had it.
Can you hold?

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.842
We're spread thin, sir,
but we'll give them hell!

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:58.519
Crandall, this is Trojan-Six.
It's too hot down here.

01:00:58.603 --> 01:01:01.230
- I'm closing the LZ.
You copy that, Too Tall?

01:01:01.314 --> 01:01:02.857
Copy that, Snake.

01:01:03.525 --> 01:01:06.735
All 7th Cav air units,
LZX-Ray is closed.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.864
I don't like it. First time out,
a whole battalion massacred?

01:01:09.906 --> 01:01:11.824
You think this is a massacre?

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:14.076
I call losing a load of draftees
a bad week.

01:01:14.161 --> 01:01:15.619
Losing a colonel is a massacre.

01:01:15.704 --> 01:01:17.037
Moore is still fighting.

01:01:17.122 --> 01:01:19.206
He's under strength
against more men than he can count.

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:21.709
- He's got a whole platoon lost.
- They're not lost.

01:01:21.793 --> 01:01:24.128
They're only cut off and surrounded.

01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:28.799
Then they're lost.

01:01:29.134 --> 01:01:31.302
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

01:01:33.221 --> 01:01:36.891
We need to carve out an emergency LZ
right over there.

01:01:36.933 --> 01:01:38.893
- Sir!
- Blow the trees down!

01:01:48.528 --> 01:01:49.987
Fire in the hole!

01:01:56.077 --> 01:01:57.578
Colonel, this is Snakeshit
and Too Tall.

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:00.581
We're coming in
with two full loads of ammo.

01:02:00.624 --> 01:02:02.583
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.

01:02:02.626 --> 01:02:05.503
When you come in,
come in from the east! Out!

01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:12.176
Colonel, it's Brigade Headquarters.
They want you out.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.179
- Well, we can't get out, damn it!
- Not all of us. Just you.

01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:17.598
Saigon wants to debrief you.

01:02:18.391 --> 01:02:20.935
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Say again.

01:02:20.977 --> 01:02:22.770
Will you repeat that order?

01:02:28.777 --> 01:02:31.278
Too Tall, follow the Colonel
to the new LZ.

01:02:31.821 --> 01:02:33.531
I see him, Snake.

01:02:37.744 --> 01:02:40.246
Right here! Let's go! Move!

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:44.458
Let's move! Move!

01:02:45.126 --> 01:02:47.795
- Oh, shit.
- Come on! Come on!

01:02:47.837 --> 01:02:50.464
- Grab him, I'll give you a hand!
- Get the wounded onboard!

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:53.092
All right, get that ammo out
and get the wounded on!

01:02:53.134 --> 01:02:55.386
Come on, bring them on!
Get them on, boys!

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:56.679
Come on!

01:03:02.686 --> 01:03:04.520
No, no, we're overloaded!

01:03:04.604 --> 01:03:06.397
- Leave him!
- I'll get out! It's Ray!

01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:08.399
He's hurt worse than me!

01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:12.570
You hang on!
I'll see you back there, Ray!

01:03:38.054 --> 01:03:40.347
You, me and Ouellette
are all we have in reserve.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:42.641
Yeah, but it's slacking up a little.

01:03:42.684 --> 01:03:46.020
No, they're just regrouping
for another assault.

01:03:46.563 --> 01:03:48.314
Distribute that ammo.

01:03:48.815 --> 01:03:53.027
Ouellette, you tell Crandall he's got time
to get one more flight in here.

01:03:53.111 --> 01:03:54.320
Yes, sir.

01:03:57.699 --> 01:04:00.242
Doc, you give this water
to the wounded.

01:04:02.704 --> 01:04:05.789
Running out of water.
Must be terrible for them.

01:04:06.207 --> 01:04:08.500
Those guys are cut off out there.

01:04:14.299 --> 01:04:16.216
Running low on ammo, Sarge!

01:04:16.676 --> 01:04:19.470
Pick your target. One shot, one kill.
All right?

01:04:19.554 --> 01:04:21.930
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How we doing, Doc?

01:04:22.015 --> 01:04:23.891
What? Ernie, we're out of water.

01:04:25.977 --> 01:04:27.853
That's the last of it.

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:44.411
My face is on fire! Help!

01:04:44.496 --> 01:04:47.373
It's phosphorus! Hold still! Hold still!

01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:49.500
I'll cut your face! Hold still!

01:05:03.223 --> 01:05:05.265
Doc, Doc, it's phosphorus!

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:06.600
Okay!

01:05:08.978 --> 01:05:11.397
Does anybody have
any more bandages?

01:05:25.745 --> 01:05:26.912
Ernie!

01:05:26.955 --> 01:05:28.914
Ernie, you hit, too?

01:05:28.957 --> 01:05:31.291
- You hit?
- No, no, I'm okay.

01:05:31.376 --> 01:05:34.128
Our guys are gonna come for us,
aren't they?

01:05:36.214 --> 01:05:37.339
Yeah.

01:05:37.424 --> 01:05:38.507
When?

01:05:40.969 --> 01:05:42.511
Plug his wound.

01:05:45.223 --> 01:05:47.766
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.

01:05:58.236 --> 01:05:59.486
Go! Move!

01:06:02.949 --> 01:06:06.660
- Go, Parker! Get up in there!
- This is Too Tall. I'm clear.

01:06:06.828 --> 01:06:08.495
Crandall's clear.

01:06:14.627 --> 01:06:15.794
Colonel!

01:06:15.837 --> 01:06:18.255
I want you to go over there
and reinforce that company!

01:06:18.339 --> 01:06:20.340
- On that ridge there! Look!
- Yes, sir!

01:06:20.425 --> 01:06:22.301
Okay! Keep your head down!

01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:26.346
To the top of the ridge! Move it!

01:06:26.431 --> 01:06:28.599
Come on, let's move! Move!

01:06:31.644 --> 01:06:33.145
Run! Come on!

01:06:39.944 --> 01:06:44.156
Captain Nadal, we've got to
break through to that cut off platoon!

01:06:45.366 --> 01:06:47.951
We got an American platoon out there.

01:06:48.119 --> 01:06:51.246
An Air Cav platoon cut off out there!

01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:53.707
Air Cav! Air Cav!

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.167
Garry Owen!

01:07:12.727 --> 01:07:14.228
He said, "Really? Me, too. "

01:07:14.312 --> 01:07:17.231
I said, "I know.
Your mama asked me to give you $600."

01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:22.069
Hey! Good luck to you.

01:07:27.242 --> 01:07:29.409
Hey, you got enough room
for one more?

01:07:30.328 --> 01:07:33.163
- If you're crazy enough, get in.
- Yes, sir.

01:07:49.931 --> 01:07:52.683
Hey, what are those lights down there?

01:07:53.434 --> 01:07:54.977
Enemy soldiers.

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:58.021
They use candles on the trail.

01:07:58.606 --> 01:08:01.233
They're moving into position to attack.

01:08:04.445 --> 01:08:05.821
Here we go!

01:08:28.595 --> 01:08:32.514
Unload that shit!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:08:38.145 --> 01:08:41.398
You and your boys have done
a hell of a job today, Snake.

01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:44.067
It's the last flight
for the night, Colonel,

01:08:44.152 --> 01:08:45.944
but you need us, you call us.

01:08:50.073 --> 01:08:52.910
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a reporter, sir.

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.037
Yeah.

01:08:55.412 --> 01:08:57.331
Joe Galloway, UPI.
How's it going, Colonel?

01:08:57.415 --> 01:08:59.625
Well, we've been flat to the boards
since last night,

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.460
and we're greatly outnumbered.

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:04.087
You got more enemy coming, too, sir.

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:05.212
I saw a whole chain of lights

01:09:05.298 --> 01:09:06.548
coming down the mountain
on the way in.

01:09:06.633 --> 01:09:08.383
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:08.468 --> 01:09:10.676
Well, I can't guarantee your safety.

01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:12.386
Yes, sir, I know.

01:09:13.014 --> 01:09:15.432
- Where you from, son?
- Refugio, Texas, sir.

01:09:16.059 --> 01:09:19.519
Well, that's the first thing I heard all day
that makes any sense.

01:09:19.562 --> 01:09:21.647
Captain Dillon, do you see those lights

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.189
coming down the trails
on the mountain?

01:09:23.232 --> 01:09:25.859
- On it right now, sir.
- You fry them sons of bitches.

01:09:25.902 --> 01:09:28.654
Whiskey-Six, this is Trojan-Three.
Fire mission.

01:09:28.696 --> 01:09:32.198
Tango Foxtrot, 4-niner-6-5-6-niner.

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:41.625
All operations
are suspended for the evening.

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:45.170
Morning operations
will be scheduled for 0530 hours.

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:17.577
Where's Crandall?

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:20.205
- Where's Crandall?
- He's right there, sir.

01:10:20.248 --> 01:10:23.250
Crandall, you led my men into a hot LZ.

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.419
Yeah, somebody had to fly out
the wounded.

01:10:25.461 --> 01:10:27.421
No, no, don't you play hotshot with me.

01:10:27.463 --> 01:10:29.548
Now, you know the rules.
You suckered us in there.

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:31.842
If you ever do it again,
I'm gonna have you busted!

01:10:31.926 --> 01:10:34.970
You got the balls to face me,
but not the balls to face the enemy?

01:10:35.054 --> 01:10:36.096
Hey, hey, hey!

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.931
- Get out of here.
- Whoa!

01:10:38.266 --> 01:10:40.809
I ever see you again, I'll kill you.

01:10:44.981 --> 01:10:46.440
That's right.

01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:48.775
Hey.

01:10:54.949 --> 01:10:56.616
Quite a day, huh?

01:11:02.331 --> 01:11:04.249
Tomorrow will be worse.

01:11:07.128 --> 01:11:09.212
If they make it to tomorrow.

01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:20.807
Ernie,
it's pitch black.

01:11:20.892 --> 01:11:23.393
I can't see anything,
but I can smell them.

01:11:23.478 --> 01:11:25.228
Dead bodies stink, Bungum.

01:11:25.313 --> 01:11:28.857
No, it's not the dead ones.
I can smell them crawling up on us.

01:11:29.984 --> 01:11:31.610
I'm telling you.

01:11:36.449 --> 01:11:40.619
I need illumination, 6-5-0-1-5-0.

01:11:58.346 --> 01:12:01.098
I need artillery
on previously established targets!

01:12:01.182 --> 01:12:04.601
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie!
Fire for effect!

01:12:04.852 --> 01:12:06.436
Fire for effect!

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:11.942
Save your ammo! Cease fire!

01:12:12.944 --> 01:12:14.236
Is anybody hit?

01:12:16.405 --> 01:12:19.324
Captain, if you guys are coming,
you gotta let us know.

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:20.700
It's pitch black out here.

01:12:20.785 --> 01:12:23.120
I don't wanna shoot
any of our own guys. Copy?

01:12:24.664 --> 01:12:25.956
Savage,

01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:29.376
we can't make it tonight.

01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:34.214
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.

01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:37.843
We'll come get you in the morning.

01:12:40.263 --> 01:12:41.555
Yes, sir.

01:12:43.558 --> 01:12:44.599
Out.

01:13:39.614 --> 01:13:41.239
You're doing a fine job, son.

01:13:41.282 --> 01:13:44.326
Don't worry. We gave them
more than they gave us today.

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:45.785
Keep it up.

01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:47.913
- How you boys doing?
- Fine, sir.

01:13:47.955 --> 01:13:51.082
You keep doing what you're doing,
we'll be fine.

01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:55.712
Your men have done a hell of a job
today, Lieutenant Geoghegan.

01:13:55.796 --> 01:13:58.715
They won't get through us, sir.
You can count on it.

01:13:58.799 --> 01:14:00.592
I know that, Jack.

01:14:00.635 --> 01:14:01.968
Keep it up, son.

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.139
It's Rear Headquarters.

01:14:06.224 --> 01:14:07.641
How is it out there, Colonel?

01:14:07.725 --> 01:14:10.644
We're surrounded,
but we're holding on, sir.

01:14:12.021 --> 01:14:15.398
Sir, I need a confirmed count
of our dead and wounded.

01:14:15.483 --> 01:14:17.651
I got to know where all my boys are.

01:14:17.735 --> 01:14:19.486
You'll get it, Hal.

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:24.199
Here they come.

01:14:24.283 --> 01:14:25.867
Captain Edwards.

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:29.329
We need illumination on the perimeter.

01:14:29.413 --> 01:14:31.539
Whiskey-Five,
this is Hot Wire-Six-Alpha.

01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:33.625
We need illumination now.

01:15:09.662 --> 01:15:26.511
Cathy?

01:15:29.056 --> 01:15:30.432
A telegram.

01:15:30.766 --> 01:15:33.143
A cab delivers a telegram.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.022
"The Secretary of the Army

01:15:38.858 --> 01:15:40.233
"regrets... "

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:40.293
Mrs. Moore?

01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.170
Colonel Moore's wife?

01:16:44.465 --> 01:16:45.507
Yes.

01:16:47.259 --> 01:16:49.552
I need help finding an address.

01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:52.847
- I'm looking for...
- You jackass!

01:16:53.682 --> 01:16:57.560
Do you know what this is?
Do you know what you just did to me?

01:17:10.783 --> 01:17:12.992
I don't like this job, ma'am.

01:17:14.161 --> 01:17:16.162
I'm just trying to do it.

01:17:20.793 --> 01:17:23.670
Wait.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.551
I'll take it to her.

01:17:36.142 --> 01:17:37.350
And tell the cab company,

01:17:37.435 --> 01:17:40.520
if there are any others,
just bring them to me.

01:17:51.031 --> 01:17:52.198
Julie.

01:17:52.992 --> 01:17:55.034
I just went by to see Catherine.

01:17:55.077 --> 01:17:56.703
Everybody knows.

01:17:57.746 --> 01:18:00.206
No chaplains or counselors?
Cab drivers?

01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:02.167
The Army wasn't ready.

01:18:05.004 --> 01:18:06.629
I'll go with you.

01:18:07.548 --> 01:18:09.382
- Thanks.
- Who's it for?

01:18:20.394 --> 01:18:24.314
Mmm-mmm.

01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:26.232
No.

01:18:41.332 --> 01:18:42.916
Mmm-mmm.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.927
I thought she would hate me.

01:18:55.262 --> 01:18:57.680
Your husband didn't start the war.

01:18:57.765 --> 01:19:00.850
They all knew this could happen,
and so did we.

01:19:22.748 --> 01:19:24.624
I'll take care of this.

01:19:24.708 --> 01:19:26.334
I'll go with you.

01:19:29.672 --> 01:19:32.173
We'll do one at a time. Okay?

01:19:33.467 --> 01:19:36.052
- We won't look.
- Okay.

01:20:32.568 --> 01:20:36.613
Julie, do you think
there'll be more telegrams tomorrow?

01:20:40.826 --> 01:20:43.036
If there are, come and get me.

01:21:03.223 --> 01:21:06.643
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

01:21:08.395 --> 01:21:11.230
"Out of the depths I cry unto thee,
O Lord.

01:21:11.774 --> 01:21:13.566
"Lord, hear my voice:

01:21:14.735 --> 01:21:18.571
"let thine ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.

01:21:19.615 --> 01:21:22.367
"If thou, O Lord,
shall mark our iniquities,

01:21:23.994 --> 01:21:25.912
"Lord, who can abide them?

01:21:28.916 --> 01:21:31.000
"But with thee there is mercy. "

01:21:33.504 --> 01:21:36.089
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord,

01:21:36.131 --> 01:21:38.925
and may perpetual light
shine upon them.

01:21:39.927 --> 01:21:44.097
And through the mercy of God,
may they rest in peace. Amen.

01:21:44.139 --> 01:21:47.266
In the name of the Father, and the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

01:21:53.607 --> 01:21:55.942
You got a death wish, Galloway?

01:21:56.026 --> 01:21:57.276
No, sir.

01:21:58.237 --> 01:22:00.363
Well, then why are you here?

01:22:04.827 --> 01:22:07.328
'Cause I knew these dead boys
would be here, sir.

01:22:16.088 --> 01:22:19.382
Why aren't you a soldier?
You got the guts for it.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:22.135
My daddy was a soldier.

01:22:22.177 --> 01:22:23.636
My granddaddy,

01:22:23.721 --> 01:22:26.180
two of my great-granddaddies
were soldiers.

01:22:26.265 --> 01:22:28.516
Hell, that's how I came to be.

01:22:29.017 --> 01:22:31.769
See, each of them lost a leg
in the Civil War.

01:22:31.812 --> 01:22:34.522
My Great-Granddaddy Galloway,
he lost his left,

01:22:34.606 --> 01:22:37.483
and my Great-Granddaddy Reid
lost his right.

01:22:38.986 --> 01:22:41.654
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.

01:22:41.947 --> 01:22:45.658
Every year after that, same date,
same store, they'd get together

01:22:45.701 --> 01:22:48.327
and pick out a brand new pair of shoes
for the two of them.

01:22:48.370 --> 01:22:50.329
- You are shitting me.
- No, sir.

01:22:50.372 --> 01:22:51.914
I swear to God.

01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:56.753
Anyway, one had a daughter,
one had a son, my grandparents.

01:22:56.837 --> 01:22:58.379
What the hell do you suppose the odds

01:22:58.464 --> 01:23:01.007
of them having
the same shoe size was?

01:23:02.593 --> 01:23:05.887
I don't know, Colonel.
It was meant to be, I guess.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.263
Yeah.

01:23:08.557 --> 01:23:09.974
Meant to be.

01:23:11.977 --> 01:23:16.439
You know, sir, Galloways have been
in every war this country's ever fought.

01:23:16.523 --> 01:23:19.650
When it came to this one,
I didn't think I could stop a war.

01:23:19.693 --> 01:23:21.277
You know,

01:23:21.361 --> 01:23:23.863
I just thought maybe
I might try and understand one.

01:23:25.324 --> 01:23:28.159
Maybe help folks back home
understand.

01:23:30.996 --> 01:23:33.372
I just figure I could do that better

01:23:33.457 --> 01:23:36.542
shooting a camera
than I could shooting a rifle.

01:23:39.713 --> 01:23:40.963
Well...

01:23:43.258 --> 01:23:46.010
I sure hope you make it
through this one.

01:23:46.261 --> 01:23:47.929
You, too, Colonel.

01:25:41.376 --> 01:25:42.835
Right 20!

01:25:59.811 --> 01:26:01.604
Put it right on them!

01:27:18.098 --> 01:27:19.557
Colonel, sir.

01:27:21.518 --> 01:27:23.477
- Captain Nadal.
- Sir.

01:27:29.276 --> 01:27:30.526
What is it, sir?

01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:33.279
Nothing's wrong,
except there's nothing wrong.

01:27:39.119 --> 01:27:41.620
Best get back to the termite mound.
You'll be fine. Go on.

01:27:41.663 --> 01:27:43.664
Roger that, sir. Come on!

01:27:44.624 --> 01:27:46.709
All right, pass the word on.

01:27:46.793 --> 01:27:50.671
Every man fire three rounds
at anything that looks suspicious to him.

01:27:50.756 --> 01:27:52.214
On my signal.

01:28:14.821 --> 01:28:17.782
They're gonna hit us like this
along the whole perimeter.

01:28:17.824 --> 01:28:19.492
We gotta get back
to that termite mound.

01:28:19.576 --> 01:28:21.452
Better hang here a minute, sir!

01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:23.746
Shit.

01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.085
We need a medic!

01:28:35.967 --> 01:28:37.551
Sir! Sir!

01:28:37.636 --> 01:28:40.179
Captain Edwards, Charlie Company,
on the ridge.

01:28:40.263 --> 01:28:41.347
Bob.

01:28:41.473 --> 01:28:43.307
They're inside the artillery!

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:44.725
I need...

01:28:45.936 --> 01:28:48.604
Bob. Bob!

01:29:12.379 --> 01:29:14.547
Godboldt, I need a grenade!

01:29:26.059 --> 01:29:28.060
Go, Willie! Come on, let's go!

01:29:34.359 --> 01:29:35.734
Godboldt's down!

01:29:39.239 --> 01:29:40.698
I'll get him!

01:29:47.497 --> 01:29:48.747
Willie!

01:30:03.763 --> 01:30:05.639
Get those guys some help over there!

01:30:05.724 --> 01:30:07.933
Captain Dillon,
I want you to get Bravo Company

01:30:07.976 --> 01:30:11.687
to send a platoon across the LZ
and support Charlie Company.

01:30:12.272 --> 01:30:15.107
Bravo-Six, this is Trojan-Three.
Bravo-Six, this is Trojan-Three.

01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:18.277
And tell Charlie Company
to get real small in their holes.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.821
I'm gonna drop some artillery
right on top of them!

01:30:20.906 --> 01:30:22.156
Charlie Company, get small.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.825
We got AT coming
right on top of your position.

01:30:25.118 --> 01:30:26.869
We're being overrun!

01:30:26.953 --> 01:30:29.371
Nah, boys! We're gonna win this fight.

01:31:16.044 --> 01:31:19.880
Yes, sir, they brought a main force
VC battalion against us, too.

01:31:19.965 --> 01:31:23.676
Colonel, I request that you dispatch
another company of reinforcements

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.178
for movement
as soon as it can be accomplished

01:31:26.221 --> 01:31:27.513
without undue risk.

01:31:27.597 --> 01:31:29.932
Done. How bad is it, Hal?

01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:36.855
It's getting pretty sporty down here, sir.

01:31:38.984 --> 01:31:40.734
Get out of the way!

01:31:50.829 --> 01:31:53.247
Medic! Get a medic over here!

01:31:58.128 --> 01:32:01.297
- Hey, what's your name, soldier?
- Jimmy Nakayama.

01:32:01.381 --> 01:32:03.048
I got a baby being born today.

01:32:03.133 --> 01:32:05.551
- Oh, wow! Congratulations!
- Thanks!

01:32:10.473 --> 01:32:11.849
Medic!

01:32:16.354 --> 01:32:18.897
Can't take no pictures
lying down there, sonny.

01:32:22.277 --> 01:32:23.986
Down, right there.

01:32:28.325 --> 01:32:30.367
Sir, how... I'm a noncombatant, sir.

01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:32.745
Ain't no such thing today, boy.

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:38.500
Shit.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.921
Why aren't those mortars firing?

01:32:43.006 --> 01:32:44.923
What's the problem here?

01:32:45.008 --> 01:32:46.633
These tubes are red hot, sir.

01:32:46.718 --> 01:32:49.094
I'm afraid we're gonna cook a round off
and blow us all up.

01:32:49.179 --> 01:32:52.723
And we can't cool them off
'cause we're all out of water.

01:32:58.521 --> 01:33:00.773
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

01:33:00.815 --> 01:33:02.399
Jimmy, come on.

01:33:03.651 --> 01:33:05.069
Go, go, go.

01:33:05.445 --> 01:33:06.987
Yeah, come on.

01:33:29.552 --> 01:33:30.886
Gentlemen,

01:33:31.388 --> 01:33:33.806
prepare to defend yourselves.

01:33:43.358 --> 01:33:44.900
Grenade!

01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:34.825
Negative! Negative! Stand by!

01:34:35.535 --> 01:34:37.536
My pilots do not see the enemy.

01:34:38.037 --> 01:34:39.746
They cannot pick out our friendlies.

01:34:39.831 --> 01:34:41.540
Bravo-Six, say again. Do you read?

01:34:41.624 --> 01:34:44.877
You gotta tell your company commander
to pop smoke now.

01:34:44.961 --> 01:34:48.088
- They need to mark the lines right now!
- We have no lines!

01:34:48.173 --> 01:34:51.550
We have enemies and friendlies
mixed in all over the place right now.

01:34:51.593 --> 01:34:53.552
Sir, our perimeter is collapsing.

01:34:53.595 --> 01:34:55.888
Alpha Company
and Bravo Company cannot hold.

01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:58.223
Charlie Company is being overrun.

01:35:00.768 --> 01:35:02.311
Net call! Net call!

01:35:02.896 --> 01:35:04.646
Keep this net clear!

01:35:20.705 --> 01:35:21.997
Hastings!

01:35:26.085 --> 01:35:31.924
Broken arrow!

01:35:32.759 --> 01:35:35.886
I say again! Broken arrow!

01:35:35.929 --> 01:35:37.763
Broken arrow!

01:35:38.056 --> 01:35:39.515
Confirm. Broken arrow.

01:35:39.599 --> 01:35:41.558
Broken arrow confirmed.

01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:42.809
Broken arrow?

01:35:42.894 --> 01:35:44.978
That means that an American unit
has been overrun.

01:35:45.063 --> 01:35:47.856
It calls in every combat aircraft
for support.

01:35:47.941 --> 01:35:50.776
My God, there's no hiding it now.

01:36:12.048 --> 01:36:15.133
- Charlie Company, report!
- Signal is out!

01:36:15.176 --> 01:36:17.219
Bravo Company, report!

01:36:17.845 --> 01:36:20.806
Roger that!
Planes are on their way, Colonel!

01:36:22.058 --> 01:36:23.141
Sir!

01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:28.647
Roger that!

01:36:39.617 --> 01:36:42.119
We have planes
stacked up at every 1,000 feet

01:36:42.161 --> 01:36:45.330
from 7,000 to 35,000.
We'll get them, sir!

01:36:46.916 --> 01:36:50.836
Advancing north
on our position at 1-5-0.

01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:11.982
9-6-2-5-0-7...

01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:21.325
Bring it in closer in on 3-1-5 degrees!

01:37:21.367 --> 01:37:25.454
That's 0-5-0! Repeat, 0-5-0!

01:37:31.252 --> 01:37:32.628
Goddamn it.

01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:48.518
Company sights enemy in the open,
advancing north on our position.

01:37:48.561 --> 01:37:52.230
They're advancing on 5 degrees
at 1-5-0.

01:37:53.024 --> 01:37:57.736
Bring it in closer in
on 315 degrees at 0-5-0...

01:37:57.779 --> 01:38:00.447
Charlie, call that son of a bitch off!

01:38:00.531 --> 01:38:02.115
Call an abort now!

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.575
Pull up!

01:38:05.995 --> 01:38:07.496
Get down!

01:38:32.355 --> 01:38:33.605
Charlie!

01:38:34.399 --> 01:38:37.109
Charlie, listen to me.
You're keeping us alive now.

01:38:37.151 --> 01:38:40.112
You forget about that one
and you keep them coming in.

01:38:40.196 --> 01:38:42.114
You're doing well, son.

01:38:44.409 --> 01:38:47.744
7-0-2, attack against the tree line.

01:38:59.337 --> 01:39:02.089
Medic! Medic!

01:39:03.341 --> 01:39:04.967
Medic!

01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:19.899
- Oh, God! Jimmy.
- You know this guy?

01:39:19.983 --> 01:39:22.860
You know him? Talk to him.
Just talk to him!

01:39:22.944 --> 01:39:24.945
Jimmy, do you hear me?

01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:27.156
It's Joe. It's Joe Galloway.

01:39:27.365 --> 01:39:30.701
Doc's giving you morphine.
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:39:36.833 --> 01:39:39.710
We gotta get him to the landing zone.
Grab his legs!

01:39:52.307 --> 01:39:55.309
You gotta get him out of here. Hey! Hey!

01:39:55.393 --> 01:39:58.229
I can't help you!
You gotta do it by yourself!

01:39:58.271 --> 01:40:00.731
- Get him on that chopper, okay?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:59.958 --> 01:41:02.084
Tell my wife I love her

01:41:02.502 --> 01:41:04.044
and my baby!

01:41:04.671 --> 01:41:06.588
You tell them!

01:42:32.842 --> 01:42:34.468
- Captain Nadal.
- Sir.

01:42:34.552 --> 01:42:37.054
Now that we put them back on their
heels and we got us a lull,

01:42:37.097 --> 01:42:38.180
I want you to attack.

01:42:38.723 --> 01:42:41.558
I want you to go over there
and rescue that cut off platoon.

01:42:41.643 --> 01:42:44.478
Yes, sir! First Squad, move out!

01:42:46.564 --> 01:42:48.440
Come on, guys. Move it!

01:42:53.238 --> 01:42:54.571
Add 50.

01:42:54.823 --> 01:42:56.990
Keep moving the artillery forward!

01:42:57.075 --> 01:42:59.410
Keep walking the artillery forward!

01:42:59.494 --> 01:43:01.036
Spread it out!

01:43:03.998 --> 01:43:05.249
Move it!

01:43:09.254 --> 01:43:11.463
Move it! Keep moving forward!

01:43:27.689 --> 01:43:30.482
Sergeant Savage, you guys still here?

01:43:48.543 --> 01:43:51.128
We have 40 KIA, we have two MIA.

01:43:51.212 --> 01:43:53.714
Those are the latest numbers. Over.

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.163
That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage.

01:44:34.714 --> 01:44:37.341
Forty dead, two unaccounted for, sir.

01:44:37.675 --> 01:44:38.842
Right.

01:44:40.512 --> 01:44:43.847
All right, boys, let's get them up
and get them out.

01:44:51.814 --> 01:44:55.275
Let's get them out of here
and get them on the chopper!

01:44:58.905 --> 01:45:01.031
Since most of the men
being loaded on the choppers

01:45:01.115 --> 01:45:03.575
are from Charlie Company,
I want you to take their place.

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.536
I'll show you where after dark.
Follow me.

01:45:05.578 --> 01:45:07.246
Yes, sir! Let's go!

01:46:05.263 --> 01:46:08.140
Captain, you ought to have your men
dig some firing steps in these holes.

01:46:08.224 --> 01:46:10.350
Throw some dirt on those bodies,
keep the smell down.

01:46:10.435 --> 01:46:12.436
Roger, Sergeant Major.

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.481
Kind of makes you wish you'd
signed up for submarines, don't it?

01:46:16.566 --> 01:46:19.026
Colonel, Brigade Headquarters
wants you lifted out

01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:21.111
on the first chopper at dawn.

01:46:21.154 --> 01:46:24.865
Now, what idiot would keep ordering
that in the middle of a goddamn battle?

01:46:24.949 --> 01:46:27.284
General Westmoreland
wants a briefing.

01:46:27.368 --> 01:46:28.619
Give me the horn.

01:46:28.703 --> 01:46:30.454
I am in a fight

01:46:30.496 --> 01:46:33.415
and I object to this order
to return to Saigon.

01:46:33.458 --> 01:46:35.626
Now, I will not leave my men.

01:46:35.668 --> 01:46:37.461
Is that clear? Out.

01:46:45.595 --> 01:46:47.638
There's two of my men
unaccounted for out there

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.389
and it's where the worst
of the fighting was,

01:46:49.474 --> 01:46:51.183
so I figure
they'll be out there someplace.

01:46:51.267 --> 01:46:52.851
Let's go out and get them.
What do you say?

01:46:52.935 --> 01:46:55.187
- I'm with you, sir.
- All right.

01:46:55.772 --> 01:46:57.022
Let's go.

01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:45.297
Julie?

01:48:50.261 --> 01:48:53.513
They brought another.

01:48:53.973 --> 01:48:57.434
- Oh, God. Julie. Julie, it's yours.
- No.

01:49:44.190 --> 01:49:46.316
He died keeping my promise.

01:50:17.557 --> 01:50:19.850
Sir, they're ordering us all out.

01:50:19.892 --> 01:50:21.226
All of us.

01:50:21.811 --> 01:50:24.437
They're gonna march reinforcements in.

01:50:24.772 --> 01:50:27.691
They don't understand
a damn thing, do they?

01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:29.609
Can't get out.

01:50:32.154 --> 01:50:34.698
He's waiting up there in a cave,
and that's what he wants.

01:50:34.782 --> 01:50:37.200
The minute he sees live soldiers
hopping on a helicopter,

01:50:37.243 --> 01:50:39.786
he'll be all over us
and then he'll get what he wants.

01:50:39.871 --> 01:50:41.746
He'll get his massacre.

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.884
Requesting permission
to rejoin the line, sir.

01:50:57.221 --> 01:50:58.763
All right, son.

01:51:02.935 --> 01:51:04.561
Garry Owen, sir.

01:51:27.627 --> 01:51:29.794
I wonder what was going
through Custer's mind

01:51:29.879 --> 01:51:33.173
when he realized
he'd led his men into a slaughter.

01:51:34.425 --> 01:51:36.593
Sir, Custer was a pussy.

01:51:38.971 --> 01:51:40.305
You ain't.

01:51:43.893 --> 01:51:45.101
Goddamn.

01:51:50.483 --> 01:51:51.608
Hell.

01:51:55.529 --> 01:51:57.822
Right now they're planning
their final attack,

01:51:57.907 --> 01:52:00.283
the one that's gonna finish us off.

01:52:00.701 --> 01:52:02.661
They'll nibble at us all night,

01:52:02.745 --> 01:52:06.247
then come dawn,
they'll hit us with everything they got.

01:52:07.917 --> 01:52:10.502
I know that's what I'd do if I was him.

01:52:15.591 --> 01:52:19.344
Sergeant Major,
hand out the last of the ammunition.

01:52:19.428 --> 01:52:20.679
Yes, sir.

01:53:42.094 --> 01:53:43.553
Fix bayonets.

01:58:01.103 --> 01:58:03.813
You were wondering
how Custer felt, sir.

01:58:05.232 --> 01:58:07.066
You ought to ask him.

02:00:25.581 --> 02:00:27.165
Sergeant Savage!

02:00:35.966 --> 02:00:38.176
Checking the dead enemies
for documents

02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:41.053
and I found this on the guy
that tried to bayonet you.

02:00:41.138 --> 02:00:43.431
Translated some of it, mostly personal.

02:00:43.474 --> 02:00:46.309
Thought you might wanna
have a look at it.

02:01:14.713 --> 02:01:16.130
- Joe!
- Joe!

02:01:17.925 --> 02:01:20.676
- What was that?
- It's American artillery.

02:01:23.305 --> 02:01:24.680
Friendly fire.

02:01:24.723 --> 02:01:26.682
Hey,
how many casualties?

02:01:29.436 --> 02:01:31.854
What the hell happened here, Joe?

02:01:36.318 --> 02:01:38.110
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Joe.

02:01:40.197 --> 02:01:42.406
Colonel Moore! Colonel Moore!

02:01:44.618 --> 02:01:47.245
Colonel! Colonel Moore!

02:01:48.330 --> 02:01:49.539
Colonel!

02:01:49.581 --> 02:01:51.374
What was the key
to your victory, Colonel?

02:01:51.416 --> 02:01:52.625
Sir, tell us how you feel.

02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:54.627
Do you feel the United States
will be forced

02:01:54.711 --> 02:01:56.754
to take the North Vietnamese
more seriously now?

02:01:56.838 --> 02:01:59.382
How do you feel
about the loss of your men, sir?

02:01:59.883 --> 02:02:02.051
Have you notified the families, sir?

02:03:18.003 --> 02:03:19.670
I'm glad you made it, son.

02:03:20.964 --> 02:03:23.132
Thank you, sir. You, too.

02:03:25.469 --> 02:03:26.594
Yeah.

02:03:28.138 --> 02:03:30.139
I'll never forgive myself.

02:03:32.601 --> 02:03:34.101
For what, sir?

02:03:39.358 --> 02:03:40.858
That my men...

02:03:45.113 --> 02:03:47.323
That my men died and I didn't.

02:04:09.846 --> 02:04:11.347
Sir, I don't...

02:04:12.057 --> 02:04:14.600
I don't know how to tell this story.

02:04:16.186 --> 02:04:18.020
Well, you got to, Joe.

02:04:20.357 --> 02:04:23.192
You tell the American people
what these men did here.

02:04:27.864 --> 02:04:29.949
You tell them how my troopers died.

02:04:36.623 --> 02:04:37.873
Yes, sir.

02:04:42.671 --> 02:04:44.046
Thank you.

02:05:32.596 --> 02:05:35.598
All of our men, living and dead,
are off the field, sir.

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.725
Well done, Sergeant Major.

02:07:34.885 --> 02:07:38.262
In Saigon, Hal Moore's
superiors congratulated him

02:07:38.346 --> 02:07:41.015
for killing over 1,800 enemy soldiers.

02:07:42.309 --> 02:07:44.643
Then ordered him
to lead the men of the 7th Cavalry

02:07:44.728 --> 02:07:47.104
back into the Valley of Death.

02:07:47.355 --> 02:07:50.482
He led them and fought beside them

02:07:51.526 --> 02:07:53.569
for 235 more days.

02:08:16.051 --> 02:08:17.343
Kids, go to bed.

02:08:17.427 --> 02:08:20.429
- Isn't there someone at the door?
- Go to bed!

02:09:01.471 --> 02:09:03.764
Children, your daddy's home!

02:09:04.182 --> 02:09:06.308
Daddy! Daddy!

02:09:10.605 --> 02:09:12.648
Some
had families waiting.

02:09:13.608 --> 02:09:17.361
For others, their only family
would be the men they bled beside.

02:09:17.487 --> 02:09:20.322
There were no bands, no flags,

02:09:21.491 --> 02:09:23.993
no Honor Guards
to welcome them home.

02:09:25.161 --> 02:09:28.622
They went to war
because their country ordered them to.

02:09:28.832 --> 02:09:32.710
But in the end they fought
not for their country or their flag.

02:09:33.128 --> 02:09:35.212
They fought for each other.

02:09:39.426 --> 02:09:40.884
Dear Barbara,

02:09:41.261 --> 02:09:46.015
I have no words to express to you
my sadness at the loss of Jack.

02:09:47.642 --> 02:09:50.352
The world is a lesser place without him.

02:09:51.062 --> 02:09:53.814
But I know he is with God
and the angels.

02:09:54.232 --> 02:09:57.443
And even heaven is improved
by his presence there.

02:09:59.362 --> 02:10:01.488
I know you, too, are sure of this

02:10:01.531 --> 02:10:04.867
and yet this knowledge
can't diminish his loss

02:10:04.993 --> 02:10:06.535
and your grief.

02:10:08.038 --> 02:10:11.331
With abiding respect and affection,
Hal Moore.

02:10:24.471 --> 02:10:28.182
We who have seen war,
will never stop seeing it.

02:10:31.603 --> 02:10:35.397
In the silence of the night,
we will always hear the screams.

02:10:39.569 --> 02:10:41.403
So this is our story,

02:10:43.364 --> 02:10:45.407
for we were soldiers once,

02:10:46.201 --> 02:10:47.534
and young.
