00:00.900 --> 00:02.745
Previously, on Harrow...

00:02.780 --> 00:03.906
Did Pavich tell you?

00:03.941 --> 00:06.288
She's authorised to have
the river bones cremated.

00:06.324 --> 00:07.407
I think he was wrong.

00:08.060 --> 00:11.425
I think that those bones might have
been in the river less than a year,

00:11.460 --> 00:12.907
maybe nine months.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.305
Harrow is a fabulous pathologist,

00:15.340 --> 00:18.065
but I wouldn't want to be around
when he self-destructs.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.905
Are you warning me off him?

00:19.940 --> 00:23.665
You should know that
Harrow is not perfect.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.225
Are you in trouble too?

00:25.260 --> 00:28.705
The police are coming, and I
know what they're looking for.

00:28.740 --> 00:30.766
It doesn't have to be
here when they arrive.

00:31.182 --> 00:34.542
You can honestly say that
you've not touched the files.

02:19.091 --> 02:21.228
_

02:30.620 --> 02:31.706
What if I was sleeping?

02:31.741 --> 02:34.588
But you're not. You at home?

02:34.624 --> 02:36.625
I'm at work.
-Pretty early.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.484
Late. Loose ends.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.794
Yeah, me too.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.705
Are you up for an after-work,
before-work coffee?

02:42.740 --> 02:44.385
We have lab-floor arabica

02:44.420 --> 02:47.025
or the Queensland Institute
of Forensic Medicine

02:47.060 --> 02:48.585
kidney stone blend
with a hint of phorminen.

02:48.620 --> 02:51.161
I think I have to keep
going on this for a while.

02:51.820 --> 02:55.265
Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm great.

02:55.612 --> 02:56.980
Call you back later.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.025
Chinese mining giant Xiagreen

03:06.060 --> 03:07.106
has arrived in Australia

03:07.141 --> 03:10.020
to finalise a $16-billion mineral deal.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.665
Hi. This is Sergeant Soroya Dass.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.505
I want to see if I can postpone
the cremation of some remains

03:28.540 --> 03:29.660
that were sent to you.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.905
Well, I don't care what
the minister wants.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.940
I am not clearing this line
until Sergeant Dass OK's it.

03:38.095 --> 03:39.537
I don't care.

03:39.942 --> 03:41.182
Hi.

03:43.580 --> 03:46.500
Are you OK?
-It's not pleasant.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.225
Hell.

03:50.260 --> 03:53.345
Lotte Bentsen, a 22-year-old
Danish media student.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.865
She was on a working holiday.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.771
Coal train came through
here at about 3am.

03:57.807 --> 03:59.113
Did he stop?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.625
Nichols said the driver didn't see her.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.345
Did she live near here?

04:03.380 --> 04:05.947
No, in the city. Student accommodation.

04:06.220 --> 04:08.945
Could she drive here?
-There's no car.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.317
We're looking into taxis and ride share.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.665
Can you take her temperatures?

04:15.700 --> 04:16.848
Yeah.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.704
How much blood should there be?
-What do you mean?

04:21.740 --> 04:24.985
Hey. Hey. This is a crime scene.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.705
I'm sorry. I'm...

04:26.740 --> 04:27.786
Sue Latchford.

04:27.821 --> 04:29.541
Federal Department of Energy.

04:30.212 --> 04:33.137
There are three passenger
trains backed up on this line

04:33.173 --> 04:34.159
and another two pending.

04:34.184 --> 04:35.945
Yeah, well, I don't
care who you are, lady.

04:35.980 --> 04:38.118
Get back into your car or I
will place you under arrest.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.546
OK.

04:39.581 --> 04:41.785
But you be sure of
yourself before you do.

04:42.620 --> 04:44.305
Get the super on the phone.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.545
Look, I've got a young woman over there

04:46.580 --> 04:47.666
that I'm not finished with.

04:47.701 --> 04:50.505
And it's awful, but our department
cannot afford bad press

04:50.540 --> 04:51.785
about rail delays today.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.437
What are you talking about?
-The Chinese mining deal.

04:54.473 --> 04:56.985
There's a lot of international
media in the city right now,

04:57.020 --> 04:58.905
and these delays make very bad press.

04:58.940 --> 05:01.305
There's a dead girl lying over there.

05:01.340 --> 05:03.585
I understand, but grinding
the city to a standstill

05:03.620 --> 05:04.980
won't bring her back.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.165
Sue Latchford.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.380
It's your deputy commissioner.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.400
Sergeant Dass.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.100
I understand.

05:20.260 --> 05:22.385
You've got three trains delayed already,

05:22.420 --> 05:24.425
a thousand cranky commuters on each one,

05:24.460 --> 05:27.425
and another three trains
likely to be delayed,

05:27.460 --> 05:30.985
so that's 6,000
pissed-off office workers

05:31.020 --> 05:32.985
texting and tweeting and snapchatting

05:33.020 --> 05:34.665
about how the government sucks

05:34.700 --> 05:37.385
on the one day you really need the
world to be hearing the opposite.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.620
Exactly.

05:40.660 --> 05:43.785
Of course, instead of
wasting the cops' time,

05:43.820 --> 05:45.345
you could be telling those passengers

05:45.380 --> 05:48.585
that getting annoyed about
a tiny delay is piss-weak.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.065
And this young woman will never be late

05:51.100 --> 05:54.665
or early or tired or
cranky or happy or sad,

05:54.700 --> 05:56.458
or anything ever again.

05:56.980 --> 05:59.290
So, you're ordering me
to shut it down now?

05:59.580 --> 06:00.940
Fine.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.600
Can I get a body bag over here, please?

06:24.028 --> 06:26.031
It's my dad's number.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.267
How does he have my number, anyway?
-He works with the cops.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.060
You have to ditch it, and we
have to ditch this place.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.579
Hey, Bryan, why would a
long-serving officer's DNA

06:51.615 --> 06:53.450
not be on the police database?

06:54.140 --> 06:55.803
Anyone in particular?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.666
Robert Quinn.

06:57.701 --> 07:00.271
That arsehole.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.945
A lot of the old-timers
just plain refused

07:02.980 --> 07:04.425
to give up their DNA on principle.

07:04.460 --> 07:05.500
Why?

07:06.479 --> 07:08.444
He's been missing 10 months.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.700
You make that sound like a bad thing.

07:12.397 --> 07:14.343
Robert Quinn was a decent copper.

07:14.980 --> 07:16.265
But even before he retired,

07:16.300 --> 07:18.743
he was burning bridges like
it was going out of style.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.589
He's a gambler.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.225
Borrowing money from
mates, not paying it back,

07:23.260 --> 07:24.985
so he ran out of money and mates.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.300
So...

07:27.350 --> 07:30.075
Don't mention Quinn in front of Harrow.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.876
If anyone hates Quinn's guts...

07:33.340 --> 07:34.660
..it's him.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.845
This is really unfair.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.802
When?

07:44.340 --> 07:45.620
Next week.

07:46.580 --> 07:48.025
I thought you deserved
to hear it from me

07:48.060 --> 07:49.677
rather than an email.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.505
Cutting to two days, I mean,

07:51.540 --> 07:53.585
how am I supposed to make
my mortgage payments and eat

07:53.620 --> 07:55.105
on two days a week?

07:55.140 --> 07:57.305
If the situation changes
and a position opens,

07:57.340 --> 07:58.820
I will let you know.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.207
There we go.

08:13.141 --> 08:14.746
Hi.
-Hi.

08:15.299 --> 08:17.624
Why is Simon allowed to
play with your records?

08:17.660 --> 08:19.905
I'm on what Harrow calls "my monthly".

08:19.940 --> 08:22.265
God. That is offensive to everyone.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.275
Once a month, I let him
pick the songs for the day.

08:25.311 --> 08:27.665
He doesn't let me. He lost a bet.
-Technically it was a draw.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.585
Technically when the new
freezer was commissioned,

08:29.620 --> 08:32.145
Harrow bet he could stand there
longer than me... naked.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.025
Otherwise it wasn't standardised.
-I know it sounds gay, right?

08:35.059 --> 08:38.102
And I would have won too, except
I had to take that phone call.

08:38.365 --> 08:40.690
Is that what the
kids call it these days?

08:41.308 --> 08:42.740
Are we ready?

08:50.325 --> 08:53.690
That's a reasonably clean cut. Below C4.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.905
C5 is crushed. C6 crushed.

08:57.940 --> 09:00.185
Some damage, C7,

09:00.220 --> 09:02.785
where the wheels' flange
would have run through.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.140
But look at the rest of her.

09:06.300 --> 09:10.585
Her ribcage, her spine. The
larger organs, her hip joints.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.025
I'm not seeing anything.
-Exactly.

09:13.060 --> 09:17.345
No broken ribs. No shattered
hip. No dislocated spine.

09:17.380 --> 09:20.658
She wasn't standing upright
when the train hit her.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.745
So she was just lying down on the tracks

09:23.780 --> 09:24.865
waiting for it to hit her?

09:26.101 --> 09:27.705
It would have taken a lot of willpower

09:27.740 --> 09:31.065
to lie still while 20,000 tonnes
of coal train bore down on you.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.616
Maybe she was drunk or stoned.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.818
We'll do a full tox.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.025
Have you looked into her mental health?

09:38.060 --> 09:40.025
Her medical records are in Denmark,

09:40.060 --> 09:41.345
so it's going to take some time.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.997
I did speak to her parents, though.

09:43.460 --> 09:46.350
They said she was a happy
girl, no history of depression.

09:47.140 --> 09:49.858
But you never know.
Everyone has secrets.

09:51.773 --> 09:53.543
Past me the endo cam.

09:54.204 --> 09:55.804
What's that in her hair?

09:57.820 --> 10:01.789
Is that dust from the tracks?
-I don't think so.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.420
There's more on her sleeve here.

10:08.910 --> 10:10.078
There.

10:11.472 --> 10:13.552
Or it's a nightclub stamp?

10:16.060 --> 10:17.763
Look here.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.425
Hand cream?

10:21.460 --> 10:23.251
Didn't notice any in her purse.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.305
You test it. I'll do the
same at scientific.

10:26.340 --> 10:30.505
These marks, the pattern
is consistent on both knees.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.500
Was there anything like
this at the scene?

10:34.460 --> 10:36.647
Can you remove her underwear?

10:46.380 --> 10:47.705
I'll get a swab.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.545
Looks like she's had unprotected sex

10:49.580 --> 10:52.192
not long before she laid
down on those train tracks.

10:52.228 --> 10:53.940
No obvious sign of trauma.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.820
Likely consensual.

10:58.420 --> 11:01.145
Hey, can I ask you something?
You don't have to answer.

11:01.180 --> 11:03.895
Yes, I saw him naked,
and, yes, it was cold,

11:03.931 --> 11:06.016
but I think it's a fairly normal size.

11:06.052 --> 11:07.932
Harrow and Steph, who divorced who?

11:10.460 --> 11:13.338
Well, I think that's a question for
the boss to answer, don't you?

11:13.820 --> 11:16.025
Yeah, it is, but he probably won't.

11:16.060 --> 11:17.585
Were you here when they got divorced?

11:17.620 --> 11:18.860
No.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.385
No, but I was here when
Steph got remarried,

11:22.420 --> 11:24.660
and if you think Harrow is
a grumpy shit now, then...

11:29.540 --> 11:30.740
I should get back.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.620
What?

12:01.100 --> 12:02.905
I see someone changed the music.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.020
I took a vote. No-one objected.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.740
What do you notice
here about her organs?

12:13.220 --> 12:14.625
Well, they're very pale.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.745
I guess she lost a lot of
blood at the train tracks.

12:16.780 --> 12:17.866
Presumably.

12:17.901 --> 12:20.265
Soroya had mentioned
blood at the scene, too.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.906
What do the crime scene photos show?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.985
Well, we were booted off the tracks

12:24.020 --> 12:27.340
before she was able to
take any beneath the body.

12:28.700 --> 12:29.820
What do we do now?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.065
This feels really dangerous.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.806
Well, rail tracks are actually quite
safe during a lightning storm.

12:39.380 --> 12:42.945
Yeah, I was actually more worried
about... you know, the trains.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.945
Yes. That.

12:45.980 --> 12:47.289
Well...

12:47.940 --> 12:49.340
here we are.

12:51.460 --> 12:52.780
Where should we start?

12:54.740 --> 12:56.272
Between the tracks.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.705
Well, there's hardly any blood.

13:00.740 --> 13:01.940
You?

13:02.660 --> 13:03.803
No.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.851
I don't get it.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.265
She lost a lot of blood,
so where did she lose it?

13:10.300 --> 13:11.740
I don't know.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.840
But it wasn't here.

13:31.620 --> 13:33.265
Hi, Steph.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.585
Hi.

13:34.620 --> 13:37.359
Sorry to drop in unannounced.
-Do you want to come in?

13:37.780 --> 13:39.514
Yeah. Thanks.

13:46.398 --> 13:47.524
What are you saying?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.545
That Lotte Bentsen bled out,

13:49.580 --> 13:51.585
but she didn't bleed out on the tracks.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.825
Well, we can't prove that now, can we?

13:53.860 --> 13:54.993
What do you think?

13:55.300 --> 13:57.585
You've got the victim's
phone, the nightclub stamp,

13:57.620 --> 13:59.545
and we know she had sex with someone.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.545
See if you can find out
which nightclub she visited

14:01.580 --> 14:02.837
and who she was with.

14:03.254 --> 14:05.307
Hope you told Dass about the blood.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.149
I've tried. She's not
answering the phone.

14:11.220 --> 14:12.226
Hey, hey.

14:12.531 --> 14:14.290
It's only me. It's only me.

14:16.220 --> 14:17.760
Look at this.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.146
What is it?

14:19.181 --> 14:22.128
Well, apparently, my step-uncle died.

14:22.580 --> 14:23.820
And, well...

14:24.860 --> 14:26.140
his place is empty.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.545
Where is it?

14:28.580 --> 14:29.945
Northern Rivers.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.625
About three hours.

14:31.660 --> 14:32.980
It's small.

14:34.420 --> 14:37.590
No running water. It's
got a tank, woodstove.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.023
I don't think the reception's too good.

14:45.020 --> 14:46.761
I'm not trying to push it, but...

14:48.420 --> 14:51.078
we're still nowhere near
saving enough for a bond.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.875
And I know you want a place of our own.

14:54.709 --> 14:56.646
My stepmum said it's ours if we want it.

14:57.014 --> 14:59.512
Rent-free. We just have
to keep the place tidy.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.665
That'd be the only toilet
you'd have to clean.

15:03.781 --> 15:06.140
I mean, I'd clean too, but...

15:08.540 --> 15:10.388
I thought it might be what you want.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.580
Get away from...

15:14.260 --> 15:16.020
whatever makes you jump like that.

15:24.420 --> 15:28.387
I thought I sent these river
bones to the crematorium.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.225
Tell me, was it you who
went behind my back

15:31.260 --> 15:34.064
or your friend Sergeant Dass?

15:34.580 --> 15:36.180
I think you should blame me.

15:37.580 --> 15:40.420
Don't piss off people
in your corner, Daniel.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.969
I knew you couldn't leave
a good case unsolved.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.026
Hi.

15:56.061 --> 15:58.612
Do you have Robert Quinn's
body in your morgue?

16:01.700 --> 16:02.985
Beg your pardon?

16:03.020 --> 16:06.265
I just got a visit from your friend,
Soroya Dass. It was a notepad visit.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.466
I was married to you long enough

16:07.501 --> 16:09.385
to know that when
a scene-of-crime officer

16:09.420 --> 16:12.220
asks about someone, that
someone is usually dead, so...

16:14.660 --> 16:15.945
is Robert dead?

16:16.500 --> 16:21.305
We have the skeletal remains
of an adult male, but so far...

16:21.340 --> 16:23.425
Dental records.
-There's no skull.

16:24.940 --> 16:28.465
The DNA from this body didn't
get a match on the database.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.865
Yeah.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.218
Right.

16:31.485 --> 16:33.045
Rob refused to give a sample.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.420
Why?

16:35.598 --> 16:38.323
He thought asking cops for
their DNA was an insult.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.180
Soroya asked about, um...

16:41.509 --> 16:43.994
if Rob had ever broken his wrist.

16:44.260 --> 16:48.385
I told her that he had a plate
in one arm that used to set off

16:48.420 --> 16:51.385
some airport metal detectors.

16:51.420 --> 16:52.962
I think he broke it at the academy.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.880
We'll look into that.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.745
Dan, if you have him,

16:56.780 --> 17:01.905
I need to get a death certificate
so that I can get his life insurance

17:01.940 --> 17:03.784
and get my house back.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.220
Don't get your hopes up.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.425
I love storms.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.505
Sailors, not so much.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.375
I think you like chaos.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.016
Only when I find the order in it.

17:43.740 --> 17:46.425
Kiriakos and Pavich think it was you

17:46.460 --> 17:49.170
that ordered the river bones
back from the crematorium.

17:50.140 --> 17:51.500
You took the blame.

17:52.820 --> 17:55.300
I was trying to help.
It was a good call.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.531
You went to see Steph
about Robert Quinn.

18:01.940 --> 18:04.705
Who's been missing for 10 months.
-Yeah.

18:04.740 --> 18:07.385
Which is how long Fairley thinks
the bones have been in the river.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.105
He does.
-Who had a broken arm.

18:09.140 --> 18:10.116
Apparently.

18:10.141 --> 18:12.900
Whose DNA is not on the register.
-Apparently not.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.825
How much did you dislike Robert Quinn?

18:21.356 --> 18:22.860
I didn't dislike him.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.253
I hated him.

18:27.997 --> 18:30.091
Because he ripped off your ex-wife?

18:31.260 --> 18:33.105
Everyone liked Quinn.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.465
Cops liked him.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.945
Even I tried to.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.140
He was charming and handsome.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.225
And when he offered to retire

18:41.260 --> 18:43.265
so Steph would go back
to teaching full-time,

18:43.300 --> 18:45.220
you'd think he'd driven the
merchants from the temple.

18:47.792 --> 18:50.237
Then he started showing
his true colours.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.545
Quinn was in pretty deep
with the money changers.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.825
Bookies and the cards.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.625
Yeah. Steph told me he took a
second mortgage out on her house

18:58.660 --> 18:59.905
and lost the lot.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.260
So she finally kicked him out.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.136
But the damage...

19:05.540 --> 19:07.020
was done.

19:08.820 --> 19:10.180
Did you kill him?

19:14.060 --> 19:15.226
If I did,

19:15.261 --> 19:16.898
do you think anyone would ever know?

19:19.500 --> 19:20.626
No.

19:25.620 --> 19:27.140
I'm not going to apologise.

19:28.580 --> 19:29.900
I don't want you to.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.325
I don't know if it's Quinn.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.981
I-I think it is. I can feel it.

19:37.365 --> 19:38.650
Copper's hunch.

19:39.162 --> 19:40.682
You think I'm crazy.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.260
I think you're quite amazing.

20:09.849 --> 20:11.249
Sorry.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.202
Hello?

20:14.940 --> 20:16.625
So, you found the nightclub she was in?

20:16.660 --> 20:19.705
Yep. About as helpful
as a cat at a dog show.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.105
High-end club.

20:21.140 --> 20:22.498
30 bucks a drink.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.105
It's all about, you know,
privacy for the clientele.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.825
There's no security cameras.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.026
There's 20 staff,

20:28.061 --> 20:30.320
and not one of them
recognised Lotte Bentsen.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.420
Why do you look so happy?

20:33.540 --> 20:36.258
We got access to her
social media accounts.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.385
Who's the guy?

20:52.420 --> 20:56.625
Yannick Hartmann. 23. Graphic
design student from Dresden.

20:56.660 --> 20:59.025
And like Ms Bentsen, only been in
the country for a couple of months.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.286
Boyfriend?

21:00.891 --> 21:03.185
Well, friends for sure. I
mean, they seem close.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.505
There's lots of text messages.
There's clips.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.105
And the last three phone
calls were from him,

21:08.140 --> 21:09.665
and currently Herr
Hartmann's not answering,

21:09.700 --> 21:12.025
so we're trying to get a
warrant on his mobile.

21:12.060 --> 21:13.460
But you have tracked her phone?

21:14.900 --> 21:16.201
Yeah.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.434
OK, here's her last 12 hours.

21:19.940 --> 21:24.025
Her student apartment, then
down to the nightclub area.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.465
She spends two hours down there,

21:25.500 --> 21:27.345
then spends another two hours down here,

21:27.380 --> 21:28.785
which is another bunch of clubs

21:28.820 --> 21:30.634
that we're door-knocking at the moment.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.380
Then out to the railway line.

21:50.599 --> 21:52.138
What are you doing?

21:53.060 --> 21:54.220
Hey.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.305
I didn't expect to see you. It's good.

21:58.340 --> 22:00.265
Are you hungry?

22:00.300 --> 22:01.500
No.

22:04.660 --> 22:06.020
Come inside.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.988
What is it?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.384
What... what have you been doing?

22:15.020 --> 22:17.100
Mum, something's come up.

22:19.746 --> 22:22.100
Callan and I, um...

22:28.400 --> 22:30.120
You can tell me anything, bub.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.545
Callan and I, um, are go...

22:37.820 --> 22:41.745
That's just, um... it's
just a friend from school.

22:41.780 --> 22:43.060
Yeah.

22:45.860 --> 22:47.545
I'll give you a call.

22:48.056 --> 22:49.736
You don't have to go.

22:50.814 --> 22:52.094
Fern...

23:15.300 --> 23:17.585
After years of coral bleaching

23:17.620 --> 23:19.425
linked to severe El Nino events,

23:19.460 --> 23:22.585
marine biologists are bracing
for even more bad news

23:22.620 --> 23:25.225
with the mercury set
to soar this summer.

23:25.260 --> 23:28.465
As rising temperatures damage
hopes of coral recovery,

23:28.500 --> 23:31.265
some fear that the reef
may be lost forever.

23:31.300 --> 23:34.140
Mining giant Xiagreen has
received the green light...

24:08.580 --> 24:11.465
It's anise myrtle.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.340
What? Hang on.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.625
Morning.
-Jesus.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.065
Shh.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.225
Sorry. What was
that again, anise what?

24:24.260 --> 24:27.065
Anise myrtle, also know as ringwood,

24:27.100 --> 24:29.705
syzygium anisatum or anetholea anisata.

24:29.740 --> 24:31.585
The anetholeas, they're the giveaway.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.160
They're very soothing.
Good morning, my angel.

24:38.368 --> 24:41.825
So, they are used in moisturisers?
-Yes.

24:41.860 --> 24:43.745
However, I am only aware of one company

24:43.780 --> 24:45.689
that extracts anise myrtle oil...

24:46.020 --> 24:47.820
so I'd start with them.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.905
You know what I don't get?
-Social cues to leave?

24:55.940 --> 24:58.305
It's how come Yellowly
lives at a nice house

24:58.340 --> 24:59.705
happily married to a hot wife

24:59.740 --> 25:01.745
while you contemplate poison,

25:01.780 --> 25:03.185
and sleep alone in a floating testament

25:03.220 --> 25:04.905
to compulsive hoarding disorder.

25:04.940 --> 25:07.745
I didn't sleep on my boat.
I slept here on my lounge.

25:07.780 --> 25:09.225
Why are you here so early anyway?

25:09.260 --> 25:11.433
Fairley's away, so I'm
taking his roster, aren't I?

25:11.469 --> 25:12.595
Where is he?

25:12.631 --> 25:14.186
Chado competition.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.225
It's a Japanese tea-making ceremony.

25:17.260 --> 25:19.294
He's in the finals.
-What?.

25:19.740 --> 25:21.100
What is this, anyway?

25:22.340 --> 25:26.065
The moisturiser that we found
under Lotte Bentsen's fingernails,

25:26.100 --> 25:31.660
it's made by one company,
and it is supplied exclusively to...

25:36.660 --> 25:37.766
Hand cream.

25:38.220 --> 25:40.140
Open Lotte Bentsen's phone journey.

25:45.900 --> 25:48.625
Now, she spent two hours
somewhere in this block

25:48.660 --> 25:50.145
before she went to the rail line.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.504
Why not here?

25:51.860 --> 25:53.860
It's a pretty fancy joint
for a travelling student.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.060
Alright. Let's see.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.145
Did you get Lotte's tox report?

26:01.180 --> 26:04.305
Yeah. Alcohol and cocaine. Big night.

26:04.340 --> 26:05.945
Unfortunately, there was no match

26:05.980 --> 26:07.465
in the database for that sperm.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.225
What about the powder on
her hair, on her clothes?

26:10.260 --> 26:12.905
Chalk. Not from the rail line.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.985
What did you get up to last night?

26:15.020 --> 26:17.145
That's a pretty unsubtle
question, Doctor.

26:17.180 --> 26:19.460
Ask me a better one,
maybe I'll answer you.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.345
Good morning, officers.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.625
Detective Senior Sergeant Bryan Nichols.

26:26.814 --> 26:28.620
You look like you're expecting us.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.345
These, suits,

26:31.380 --> 26:33.145
they're not with the
hotel staff, are they?

26:33.180 --> 26:35.505
They are legal advisers
engaged by the hotel.

26:35.540 --> 26:37.585
The hotel's in-house lawyers.

26:37.620 --> 26:38.825
Well done, Harrow.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.585
You've found a place
with something to hide.

26:40.620 --> 26:44.752
May we see your hotel guest register
for the night before last, please?

26:44.815 --> 26:48.359
The hotel wants to assist with
whatever your inquiry concerns,

26:48.395 --> 26:51.225
but our guest register is
commercial in confidence.

26:51.260 --> 26:53.745
We take our customers'
privacy very seriously.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.858
So we can't release any
information without a warrant.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.025
What about your security camera footage?

26:59.060 --> 27:00.820
Likewise, I'm afraid.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.945
Well, I guess we'll have to
drum up that warrant, then.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.065
Sergeant Dass, you start rustling
up all the people you need.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.180
Yeah.

27:23.780 --> 27:26.705
Hey. What are you doing out here?
Come in. Say hi to everyone.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.105
Not today.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.295
Maybe...

27:29.580 --> 27:30.741
Here.

27:31.633 --> 27:34.158
What's this?
-It's Robert's old toothbrush.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.688
Why?
-I need you to check it for DNA.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.440
Can you run this?
-Absolutely.

27:47.551 --> 27:49.185
Hey, Axis Sally.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.710
Sue.
-What do you want?

27:51.935 --> 27:53.241
We want to help.

27:53.277 --> 27:55.025
Well, you could help by leaving.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.305
The minister has become
aware of this investigation

27:57.340 --> 28:00.585
and wants to ensure that police
has all the resources it needs

28:00.620 --> 28:02.972
to conduct a thorough
investigation. Only...

28:03.008 --> 28:05.653
Only?
-It has to be thorough.

28:06.243 --> 28:07.425
Take your time.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.385
Put your needs in writing,
everything you need,

28:10.420 --> 28:12.265
and proceed through the proper channels.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.340
These are the proper channels.

28:15.980 --> 28:20.020
We want you to take your time.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.410
Right.

28:24.860 --> 28:27.625
Yeah. No, I get how this works.

28:27.660 --> 28:31.065
Look, if we write down a message,
can you take it to your minister?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.180
Of course.

28:38.082 --> 28:39.902
_

28:41.773 --> 28:44.135
I think I see why Maxine likes you.

28:44.233 --> 28:45.793
Do you want a duplicate, Harrow?

28:46.880 --> 28:49.080
Sergeant.
-What?

28:52.500 --> 28:53.740
There.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.391
Is that your guy?
-Yannick Hartmann.

28:59.380 --> 29:00.929
Still haven't found him?

29:04.780 --> 29:06.705
Neither of them are sure
where they are going.

29:06.740 --> 29:07.940
It's their first visit.

29:13.060 --> 29:15.265
But she has a key.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.840
Where does that go?

29:17.575 --> 29:19.344
It goes to the penthouse.

29:29.020 --> 29:33.345
I don't think a 23-year-old
graphics student rented this place.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.225
I don't think I've ever
been anywhere this clean,

29:36.260 --> 29:38.993
and I spent 12 months
in a sterilisation lab.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.020
They've cleaned this
place top to bottom.

29:43.540 --> 29:46.065
So you think Lotte Bentsen died here?

29:46.100 --> 29:47.580
Somewhere near here.

29:55.580 --> 29:58.625
Either the hotel cleaners
are super good, or...

29:58.660 --> 30:00.067
Lotte wasn't killed up here.

30:01.797 --> 30:04.002
This doesn't match
the pattern on her knees.

30:04.038 --> 30:05.158
Sarge?

30:07.660 --> 30:09.062
What is it?

30:09.460 --> 30:11.585
It's pretty damp. It looks like
it's been cleaned thoroughly.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.825
Blood?
-Or semen.

30:13.860 --> 30:15.145
We'll try and get a sample.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.825
Cut out the carpet if you have to.

30:16.860 --> 30:18.900
Dass, you there?

30:21.180 --> 30:24.185
Hey. Did you find out who
rented the penthouse?

30:24.220 --> 30:25.226
Yeah.

30:25.261 --> 30:27.265
Looks like some shell company
registered in Luxembourg.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.465
We'll keep digging. But listen.
We've reviewed the security footage.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.145
Bentsen and Hartmann
arrived about 11:15.

30:33.180 --> 30:36.020
They got into that lift, and
we do not see them again.

30:37.340 --> 30:39.507
What, so we don't see them leave?
-No.

30:40.660 --> 30:42.740
We need to ask them
where else the lift goes.

30:51.340 --> 30:53.545
There are no security cameras down here.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.740
Some of our clientele prefer
to come and go in private.

30:58.020 --> 31:00.145
Where would you park if you
were in the penthouse?

31:00.180 --> 31:01.260
Wherever I wanted.

31:03.740 --> 31:07.065
So, they pull up here, but...

31:07.100 --> 31:09.265
But there was no blood in the elevator.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.665
And there's no blood in the
penthouse either, so...

31:11.700 --> 31:14.140
So maybe she was let out alive.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.100
Yes.

31:28.780 --> 31:30.500
They brought her here to kill her.

31:32.460 --> 31:34.060
Over this grate.

31:46.540 --> 31:48.745
Some kind of powder on this fire hose.

31:48.781 --> 31:49.781
Gloves.

31:50.940 --> 31:53.060
Chalk from latex gloves.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.340
And then they drove out.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.339
Check council. Check shops.

32:01.375 --> 32:03.305
Check anywhere, left or
right of this hotel,

32:03.340 --> 32:05.665
for any security cameras that
might have been on from 1am

32:05.700 --> 32:06.786
the night before last.

32:06.821 --> 32:09.105
Go.

32:09.140 --> 32:10.500
Nichols.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.380
OK. Send it through.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.680
Well, we found Yannick Hartmann.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.745
He's cold.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.527
Rigor mortis has come and
gone at least 24 hours.

32:31.563 --> 32:34.128
This is a well-known gay cruising spot.

32:34.820 --> 32:38.886
So, from the best hotel and
club in the city to here.

32:39.380 --> 32:40.660
Look at this.

32:46.220 --> 32:47.905
Asphyxiated.

32:47.940 --> 32:50.905
But no sign of strangulation.
-Look.

32:50.940 --> 32:53.180
More powder here. Someone
wearing gloves dressed him.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.060
Can you tilt his head back for me?

33:14.620 --> 33:15.780
Cling wrap.

33:21.660 --> 33:22.940
Take it through.

33:25.180 --> 33:27.185
First up, we need to
check the semen sample

33:27.220 --> 33:28.625
found in Lotte Bentsen against this guy.

33:28.660 --> 33:31.260
I'll get McCauley to open up the lab.
-Stop.

33:32.660 --> 33:35.305
It is rank bullshit.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.023
Where the hell is this coming from?

33:37.540 --> 33:38.745
The German embassy...

33:38.780 --> 33:40.105
For Christ's sake.

33:40.140 --> 33:41.825
...has requested that the coroner

33:41.860 --> 33:43.825
not authorise an autopsy on Hartmann

33:43.860 --> 33:45.465
until...
-This is insane.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.705
<i>until they receive a full
preliminary police report.</i>

33:48.740 --> 33:50.203
Well, ignore them.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.360
Who's leaning on the Germans?
-Shut the door.

33:59.260 --> 34:03.665
If either of you mention anything
about what I'm going to show you,

34:03.700 --> 34:05.265
your lives won't be worth living.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.540
Why?

34:07.845 --> 34:11.344
A friend just sent this
to me in confidence.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.465
It could cost him his job, and me mine.

34:14.079 --> 34:17.264
Street camera footage near
the back of the Noctua Hotel.

34:17.300 --> 34:18.801
And...

34:19.420 --> 34:20.466
..there.

34:20.501 --> 34:22.264
I don't know what the
hell I'm looking at.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.705
It's a rental. Who rented it?

34:23.739 --> 34:26.745
A Red Rise Investments from Mali.

34:26.780 --> 34:29.385
But the forensic accountants
have just discovered

34:29.420 --> 34:34.225
it's owned by another company,
ZDP Industries from Luxembourg.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.426
Who rented the penthouse.

34:35.460 --> 34:37.304
And we're still working
on who owns that.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.272
Do we know where the
company is based out of?

34:39.699 --> 34:40.780
China.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.185
Australia's latest mining boom

34:44.219 --> 34:46.985
is just around the corner,
according to industry analysts,

34:47.020 --> 34:49.145
who were treated today to
a rare audience with the man

34:49.179 --> 34:51.784
behind the creation
of the $16-billion...

34:51.820 --> 34:53.945
Now, that's a man who could
afford the penthouse suite

34:53.980 --> 34:55.344
at the Noctua Hotel.

34:55.380 --> 34:58.425
...Harry Wei are expected
to formally announce the deal

34:58.460 --> 34:59.785
at a state function to be held...

35:00.403 --> 35:02.825
So, Harry Wei rented the penthouse.

35:02.860 --> 35:06.660
Probably through the same
daisy chain of companies, yeah.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.705
So, he's at the club.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.545
He meets Lotte and Yannick.

35:12.580 --> 35:13.985
They drink, they flirt.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.345
He flashes his cash.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.265
He suggests taking the party
back to his penthouse.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.465
Young travellers, super-rich
handsome man, free drugs,

35:21.500 --> 35:22.546
no-strings, why not?

35:22.581 --> 35:26.345
But Wei is discreet, so he
doesn't travel with them.

35:26.380 --> 35:28.643
But he tells them where he's staying.

35:28.679 --> 35:30.305
And he gives them the keycard.

35:30.341 --> 35:31.781
More fun in the penthouse.

35:46.220 --> 35:49.580
But Hartmann's sexual tastes
are a little edgier than Lotte's.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.540
And then things went bad.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.660
Wei is so busy on Hartmann,
he doesn't realise.

36:16.620 --> 36:18.504
Until it's too late, he's dead.

36:19.020 --> 36:21.545
Wei can't afford that kind of a problem,

36:21.580 --> 36:23.100
and Lotte is a witness.

36:25.420 --> 36:26.660
Yannie?

36:28.620 --> 36:30.865
Maybe they tell her everything is OK.

36:30.900 --> 36:32.665
They'll drive her home.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.985
Then they'll call the cops.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.185
She doesn't realise until it's too late.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.105
No, no, no.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.980
No, no.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.140
And then...

36:50.380 --> 36:51.665
..she's a suicide.

36:51.700 --> 36:55.065
And he's the victim
of erotic asphyxiation

36:55.100 --> 36:56.580
at a well-known gay cruise spot.

36:58.140 --> 37:00.905
It's all conjecture.
-But it's right.

37:00.940 --> 37:02.185
But we don't have anything.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.745
I mean, even if we can
get past the hotel lawyers

37:04.780 --> 37:07.465
and prove that Harry Wei
rented the penthouse,

37:07.500 --> 37:09.265
we can't prove what happened there.

37:09.300 --> 37:12.865
We can't prove he was involved
in her murder in the car park.

37:12.900 --> 37:16.740
And that rental car?
-Nichols is working on a warrant.

37:18.340 --> 37:20.985
I told Nichols I'd go and
talk to Hartmann's family.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.261
You want a lift?

37:23.060 --> 37:24.261
I'll walk.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.180
OK.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.180
Hey.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.825
I don't need my eyes.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.545
I've got pretty legendary
senses of hearing and smell.

37:49.580 --> 37:50.825
And... Yep.

37:50.860 --> 37:52.225
That's what I thought.

37:52.260 --> 37:54.425
The unmistakable smell of 'nuofu'.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.025
Am I pronouncing that correctly?

37:56.060 --> 37:57.385
'Nuofu'?

37:57.420 --> 37:59.745
Cowards. Weasels. Poltroons.

37:59.780 --> 38:03.140
You gutless, bully, murdering arseholes.

38:15.780 --> 38:18.105
I'm not gonna jump.
You're gonna have to kill me.

38:18.140 --> 38:20.865
We don't want to kill you, Dr Harrow.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.745
We don't want you to jump.

38:22.780 --> 38:25.607
We want you to simply... stop.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.945
Do what your superiors have told you.

38:27.980 --> 38:30.985
Stop your investigation. That's all.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.905
It's taken me quite a bit
of therapy to acknowledge

38:32.940 --> 38:34.460
that I'm just not that good at stopping.

38:37.100 --> 38:41.305
112 Moreton Street, Norman Park.

38:41.340 --> 38:43.518
That's Stephanie Tolson's
address, isn't it?

38:44.100 --> 38:47.279
Your ex-wife, mother of your daughter,

38:48.660 --> 38:50.425
a woman who lives alone.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.940
You keep Steph out of this.
-That's up to you.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.785
We can't.
-We can.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.705
We can't just up and go.
-Of course we can.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.505
It's just for the weekend.
OK, you need to get away.

39:17.540 --> 39:18.860
Jesse...

39:22.620 --> 39:24.239
I can't afford it.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.300
I'm taking you.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.500
Is the stove off?

39:43.180 --> 39:44.380
Ms Tolson?

39:46.005 --> 39:48.165
We've had a call from Dr Harrow.

39:49.540 --> 39:50.785
I'm sorry.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.465
Then tell me what it's about.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.825
It's a long story.

39:53.860 --> 39:57.265
Meddling, muddling. You can't
just do your job, can you?

39:57.300 --> 39:58.300
Listen, I...

39:59.062 --> 40:00.867
I hope it's not too strong.

40:04.621 --> 40:06.021
Have you got the car?

40:07.181 --> 40:08.614
We can't find it.

40:09.180 --> 40:10.905
We're trying to find the
person who rented it,

40:10.940 --> 40:13.065
but our phone calls are
being literally diverted

40:13.100 --> 40:14.625
through Timbuktu.

40:14.660 --> 40:15.706
It was Harry Wei.

40:15.741 --> 40:18.745
We have bodily fluid in the
victim which I swear will be his.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.997
OK, well, how are we going to
get a sample from him, Harrow?

40:21.340 --> 40:23.225
It's a bureaucratic stalemate.

40:23.260 --> 40:24.545
We've been wide-ended, mate,

40:24.580 --> 40:26.521
which is just what those pricks wanted.

40:27.460 --> 40:28.466
The deal is signed.

40:28.501 --> 40:30.625
They'll be tipping
their glasses to it tonight

40:30.660 --> 40:32.074
and they'll be going home tomorrow.

40:33.020 --> 40:34.460
You know, they won.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.040
Where are they tipping their glasses?

41:06.060 --> 41:09.625
Hi. How are you going?
Could you tell her I've got it?

41:09.660 --> 41:10.636
I beg your pardon, sir?

41:10.661 --> 41:13.105
Sue, could you tell her I've got it.

41:13.140 --> 41:14.306
I'm sorry, sir.

41:14.341 --> 41:15.745
This is a closed function,

41:15.780 --> 41:17.116
so unless your name appears somewhere...

41:17.152 --> 41:18.129
Yeah, I know.

41:18.154 --> 41:20.158
For Harry Wei, Xiagreen
and the energy minister.

41:20.194 --> 41:21.919
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

41:21.955 --> 41:24.880
Sue can't leave because
she's introducing the minister,

41:24.916 --> 41:27.716
but she can't stay
unless she deals with the...

41:30.420 --> 41:31.865
Sue.

41:31.900 --> 41:32.979
Latchford.

41:33.580 --> 41:35.745
Look. There she is inside now.

41:35.780 --> 41:37.900
Come on. The poor
woman is going nuts.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.945
Jesus Christ.

41:40.980 --> 41:42.666
Look. Here.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.705
Give Sue a call.

41:44.740 --> 41:46.225
Tell her that Dennis Guigan

41:46.260 --> 41:48.065
brought her thrush cream like she asked.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.180
It's all yours.

41:51.460 --> 41:52.700
Wait.

42:24.088 --> 42:26.780
To your health, Harry. Cheers.

43:14.100 --> 43:17.190
So that's the source of
the problem right there.

43:17.565 --> 43:19.130
I beg your pardon?

43:19.166 --> 43:22.291
If only you had used
those words, you bastard.

43:22.500 --> 43:26.225
That's all you needed to say
when that boy Hartmann died

43:26.260 --> 43:27.749
in your penthouse.

43:28.134 --> 43:31.139
All you needed to do was
call the police and say,

43:31.460 --> 43:34.535
"I'm sorry. It was an accident.

43:35.020 --> 43:37.145
"He choked while we were screwing."

43:37.180 --> 43:39.612
You probably wouldn't
even have been charged.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.249
But no.

43:41.980 --> 43:43.945
You didn't want a scandal,

43:44.347 --> 43:47.465
so you had Lotte Bentsen's throat cut

43:47.500 --> 43:49.052
just to save your dignity.

43:53.340 --> 43:56.172
You know how many people...

43:57.380 --> 43:59.745
my company has employed...

43:59.780 --> 44:03.305
Mr Pathologist?

44:03.769 --> 44:06.553
Over 80,000.

44:06.966 --> 44:08.114
And...

44:09.380 --> 44:12.905
they buy food and clothes...

44:12.940 --> 44:16.185
and cars and keep...

44:16.220 --> 44:21.940
hundreds of thousands of others working.

44:28.100 --> 44:29.460
If I was to...

44:31.380 --> 44:32.940
face a scandal...

44:35.860 --> 44:39.950
my company's share prices would drop...

44:41.054 --> 44:47.614
and hundreds of thousands of people...

44:49.380 --> 44:50.700
would go hungry.

44:54.140 --> 44:57.140
That's all more important
than just one life.

44:59.140 --> 45:02.100
You might have all the
money in the world...

45:04.420 --> 45:07.305
but you don't have the right to decide.

45:07.340 --> 45:08.780
Only...

45:10.020 --> 45:11.300
I do.

45:38.408 --> 45:40.093
Is that it?

45:41.023 --> 45:42.660
You owe me.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.145
So, it's Harry Wei's
semen in Lotte Bentsen,

45:47.180 --> 45:49.260
and it's completely inadmissible.

45:50.861 --> 45:52.381
But at least we know.

45:55.661 --> 45:58.167
CRB has the car that moved the bodies.

45:59.748 --> 46:01.880
Anonymously reported stolen.

46:03.477 --> 46:04.637
Bastards.

46:06.060 --> 46:08.606
We're not going to get any
DNA out of that, are we?

46:11.500 --> 46:12.785
And Harry Wei?

46:12.820 --> 46:15.260
He and his entourage
flew out of the country.

46:17.580 --> 46:19.080
That's probably them now.

46:20.721 --> 46:23.646
Well, we don't have an
extradition treaty with China.

46:23.682 --> 46:25.607
We'll go through the channels,
see what we can do.

46:26.123 --> 46:28.403
You know, sometimes it
just happens, Harrow.

46:29.420 --> 46:31.860
Sometimes a bloke gets away with murder.

46:43.540 --> 46:45.220
Got the all-clear, Steph.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.400
That's it. I am giving
Daniel a piece of my mind.

46:57.540 --> 46:59.905
A very sharp piece.
-Come on.

46:59.940 --> 47:01.585
No.
-Leave it.

47:01.620 --> 47:02.706
No.
-It's OK.

47:02.741 --> 47:04.060
No.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.120
Give it to me.

47:19.980 --> 47:22.940
Whoa. Are you kidding?

47:24.300 --> 47:25.500
Let's go.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.200
We'll go.

48:01.820 --> 48:02.906
Hey.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.485
Hey. What you got?

48:05.520 --> 48:09.445
Insufficient DNA on this
toothbrush. Couldn't get a profile.

48:09.580 --> 48:10.785
What toothbrush?

48:11.026 --> 48:12.706
Robert Quinn's.

48:13.565 --> 48:16.306
Steph seems to think the
river bones might be his.

48:16.900 --> 48:18.460
Yeah, I know.

48:21.260 --> 48:22.780
Is there something I need to know?

48:25.420 --> 48:26.780
Only to do your job.

49:01.700 --> 49:05.265
Quinn's phone went black
on the night of October 3rd.

49:05.300 --> 49:09.025
Now, I have roughly reconstructed
its travel on that night

49:09.060 --> 49:10.578
based on the phone towers.

49:10.860 --> 49:14.145
It travels from the
suburbs to the valley

49:14.260 --> 49:17.905
to the city back out through
the western suburbs,

49:17.940 --> 49:19.545
and it finishes here.

49:19.580 --> 49:22.733
Now, I want to search
this forest and this dam.

49:22.769 --> 49:24.130
Look, what do you want?

49:24.166 --> 49:26.145
A couple of recruits and just one day.

49:26.180 --> 49:27.905
I want to search that
bushland and trawl that dam.

49:27.940 --> 49:29.337
And if they don't find anything?

49:31.719 --> 49:33.119
I'll never mention it again.

49:38.900 --> 49:42.100
Six recruits and a supervisor. One day.

49:43.380 --> 49:45.060
Tomorrow?
-Get out.

50:08.140 --> 50:09.447
Can you find your way now?

51:04.900 --> 51:06.425
Next on Harrow...

51:06.460 --> 51:08.185
Robert Quinn's car has come up.

51:08.220 --> 51:10.825
Why didn't you tell me you
had found Quinn's car?

51:10.860 --> 51:15.065
It won't stop now until they know
whether Robert is alive or dead.

51:15.100 --> 51:18.305
What if the phones you've been
banging on about are Quinn's?

51:18.340 --> 51:19.825
We all warned Steph about it.

51:19.860 --> 51:21.825
You were the sergeant here
when Holly went missing.

51:21.860 --> 51:23.305
Holly was a friend at school.

51:23.340 --> 51:24.665
One day she vanished.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.065
Where is Holly?

51:26.100 --> 51:28.225
The only person who knew for
sure was shot in the head,

51:28.260 --> 51:29.625
and his memory went with it.

51:29.660 --> 51:31.985
Wouldn't that have killed him?
-Normally, yes.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.900
It's unusual but it happens.
