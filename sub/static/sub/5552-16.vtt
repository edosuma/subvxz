00:02.170 --> 00:03.630
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.797 --> 00:05.215
<i>I heard
they let you out of Arkham.</i>

00:05.382 --> 00:06.841
Yes. I'm sane.

00:07.425 --> 00:10.053
- I'm Elijah Van Dahl.
- Oh, Oswald Cobblepot.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.263
- You're related to Gertrud?
- My mother.

00:12.681 --> 00:13.765
She never told me.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.058
Told you what?

00:15.225 --> 00:16.393
That I had a son.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.104
You have a home now, and a father.

00:19.396 --> 00:20.689
<i>A big happy family.</i>

00:21.272 --> 00:23.608
- Is this a dream?
- It's not a dream, my boy. You're home.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.403
- Hello, Officer Pinkney. Can I come in?
- Sure.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.157
Murder weapon was a crowbar.

00:31.324 --> 00:32.492
Your fingerprints were on it.

00:32.659 --> 00:33.660
I was set up!

00:33.952 --> 00:35.495
<i>Detective Gordon guilty on all counts.</i>

00:35.829 --> 00:37.455
How can you not be with us?

00:38.039 --> 00:39.290
Birthdays,

00:39.457 --> 00:40.792
and first steps,

00:40.959 --> 00:42.168
and skinned knees.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.629
You need to go somewhere.
Start a new life.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.631
Jim, don't do this. I love you.

00:47.132 --> 00:50.593
- I'm so, so sorry.
- Jim, I love you. Don't do this. Jim!

00:56.808 --> 00:58.685
On your feet. Let's go.

01:08.194 --> 01:09.446
<i>Step out.</i>

01:11.322 --> 01:12.699
<i>Line it up.</i>

01:13.992 --> 01:17.495
<i>Face your right. Walk.</i>

01:42.520 --> 01:43.855
<i>Lights out!</i>

02:15.136 --> 02:16.638
<i>Get out there.</i>

02:26.397 --> 02:27.649
<i>Lights out!</i>

02:56.928 --> 02:58.429
<i>Keep it moving.</i>

02:59.138 --> 03:00.598
<i>Stay in line.</i>

03:02.100 --> 03:03.101
<i>Stop.</i>

03:04.686 --> 03:08.356
Prisoner Gordon,
step out of line and remain silent.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.278
<i>Let's move.</i>

03:19.659 --> 03:22.036
Several weeks with no incidents, Gordon.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.163
I'm impressed.

03:24.622 --> 03:27.625
Not what I expected.
Word was you were a troublemaker.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.502
I just wanna do my time.

03:30.962 --> 03:33.798
Well, it's time to move you.

03:34.757 --> 03:35.758
Where to?

03:35.967 --> 03:37.135
F Wing.

03:37.886 --> 03:39.095
World's End,

03:39.637 --> 03:40.847
general population.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.891
This should not come as a surprise to you.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.894
Protective custody
is just a temporary privilege.

03:46.728 --> 03:49.606
<i>One which can't be sustained
for a sentence as long as yours.</i>

03:50.106 --> 03:52.066
Now, perhaps you have an appeal pending.

03:52.483 --> 03:55.528
In which case,
I can prolong this arrangement.

03:59.866 --> 04:02.118
That's got to sting just a little, no?

04:02.827 --> 04:04.746
<i>Your people seem to have abandoned you.</i>

04:04.913 --> 04:07.373
Being convicted for murder
has its downsides.

04:08.583 --> 04:09.626
<i>Don't fret so.</i>

04:09.834 --> 04:14.005
I'm sure you'll see a lot
of familiar faces over in F Wing.

04:14.756 --> 04:18.051
Many of which you arrested yourself.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.110
It's payback time.

04:48.039 --> 04:49.123
What's up?

04:56.047 --> 04:58.091
<i>And there goes the flying scissor kick...</i>

04:58.883 --> 05:00.301
That one wasn't mine?

05:01.427 --> 05:04.889
If you show yourself to be a team player,
anything's possible.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.145
You a team player, Gordon?

05:13.231 --> 05:14.315
I love it.

05:16.234 --> 05:19.028
Oh, and I forgot to pass on
my good friend's regard.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.239
Ex-Commissioner Loeb says hi.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.910
Follow the rules
and perhaps you'll survive.

05:26.077 --> 05:28.121
Break them and you most certainly won't.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.707
It's why they call this wing
"World's End."

05:30.873 --> 05:33.084
For most here, it's exactly that. The end.

05:34.252 --> 05:36.129
Only way out, parole,

05:36.295 --> 05:37.505
or a body bag.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.925
And nobody gets parole.

05:54.897 --> 05:59.027
It's true, I swear it. Clear as day.
A ghost.

05:59.444 --> 06:02.613
She was this pale old woman
in a long black dress.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.907
- She was this close.
- What did you do?

06:05.408 --> 06:07.035
Oh, I ran away screaming of course.

06:09.579 --> 06:11.372
Do you believe in ghosts, Oswald?

06:12.457 --> 06:14.792
Yes, I do. I've seen them.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.711
This house has several of them.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.797
But don't worry,
they're all quite friendly.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.133
Don't listen to him.
There are no ghosts here.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.885
<i>Oh, there's ghosts all right.</i>

06:24.052 --> 06:25.636
This house was built by my grandfather.

06:26.429 --> 06:30.892
He died here. His wife and two sisters
also passed away upstairs.

06:31.768 --> 06:33.102
And my poor, dear parents.

06:34.729 --> 06:37.315
Yes, many ghosts.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.566
Hmm.

06:40.735 --> 06:41.903
How did you meet?

06:42.487 --> 06:44.155
That's a boring story, really.

06:44.322 --> 06:45.531
No. Let me tell it, dear.

06:45.782 --> 06:48.493
After my mother died,
I sat alone in this house for months,

06:48.785 --> 06:49.994
barely got out of bed in fact.

06:50.828 --> 06:53.372
Finally, I found a diner
not too far from here.

06:53.831 --> 06:57.168
I'd go there every day at the same time,
order the same thing.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.378
Chicken soup and a seltzer.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.172
Grace was my waitress.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.132
<i>And I grew very fond of her.</i>

07:03.382 --> 07:06.052
She told me of her two poor children,
Sasha and Charles.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.846
<i>And how they suffered at the hands
of their abusive father.</i>

07:09.430 --> 07:10.515
<i>I had to help.</i>

07:10.681 --> 07:12.683
I offered her refuge and she accepted.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.478
And this house heard laughter once again.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.648
Then one thing led to another.

07:19.524 --> 07:20.983
Love blossomed.

07:21.692 --> 07:22.985
And here we are.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.324
But you are my only true blood relative,
Oswald.

07:38.835 --> 07:42.255
- Oh, my poor dear! Are you hurt at all?
- No, no, I'm, I'm fine.

07:42.421 --> 07:43.548
Clumsy girl.

07:45.675 --> 07:47.468
To family.

07:47.802 --> 07:48.928
- Family.
- To family.

07:49.095 --> 07:51.305
- To family.
- To family.

07:57.270 --> 08:01.399
Dent, they got him
in general population now, F Wing.

08:01.566 --> 08:04.402
You know what that means?
Everyone we've ever put away is in there.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.112
<i>Stop saying that!</i>

08:06.279 --> 08:08.406
<i>There's always something you can do.
A retrial.</i>

08:08.573 --> 08:10.825
Or have him transferred to another prison
for God's sake.

08:11.409 --> 08:15.121
You know what. Just keep doing
what you always do, which is nothing!

08:18.916 --> 08:19.917
Ed.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.843
He's wasting away in that place while
the real killer is out there somewhere

08:29.010 --> 08:30.428
eating donuts and getting laid.

08:30.887 --> 08:33.931
The real killer?
The fingerprints on the murder weapon...

08:34.098 --> 08:35.433
Jim is innocent.

08:36.434 --> 08:38.060
He didn't kill Pinkney.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.065
Well, gee, I mean,
that's unfair. If that's true.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.026
What are you gonna do about it?

08:45.943 --> 08:49.030
I wish I knew. I wish I knew.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.787
My health forbids me
from drinking,

08:56.954 --> 08:59.165
but at least I can watch you
enjoy this sherry.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.125
- Hmm.
- It was my father's favorite.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.669
Is that him?

09:05.296 --> 09:07.256
<i>No, that's my
great grandfather Manfred.</i>

09:07.757 --> 09:11.344
He started a small tailor's shop
in Gotham many, many years ago.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.430
Made suits for the city's elite.

09:16.098 --> 09:19.227
My father became an apprentice
like every son before him.

09:19.769 --> 09:21.646
- You were an apprentice, too?
<i>- I was.</i>

09:22.021 --> 09:23.481
Had rather a flair for it.

09:25.650 --> 09:26.943
But it was not to be.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.363
When my father succumbed to illness,

09:32.323 --> 09:34.492
my mother held me close to her.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.078
Homeschooled me.

09:37.662 --> 09:40.790
She felt a need to protect me
from the temptations of the city.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.879
All this time I've been afraid to ask
about your mother.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.010
I'm so sorry I abandoned her.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.973
Had I known I was also abandoning you...

09:58.224 --> 10:00.977
<i>Dear God, I'm such a cowardly fool.</i>

10:02.895 --> 10:04.355
<i>Did she have a happy life?</i>

10:05.648 --> 10:09.110
No. Not a happy life. But a good one.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.280
She never hurt a soul.

10:13.364 --> 10:17.868
I was not always a good son
and she never spoke a word of reproach.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.371
"Not always a good son"?

10:21.539 --> 10:25.209
I find that hard to credit.
A nice, young man like you?

10:27.962 --> 10:29.046
Believe me.

10:31.382 --> 10:32.842
I've done bad things.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.308
We're all sinners, my boy.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.230
It's time for your medicine, my love.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.201
Thank you.

11:01.454 --> 11:04.915
Doctor gave them to me for my heart.
Better safe than sorry.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.461
You have a visitor, Mr. Gordon.
This way, please.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.296
<i>I'm not going back to the hole.</i>

11:52.922 --> 11:55.132
- He promised.
- The warden's the one who's moving you.

11:55.299 --> 11:57.593
What? This wasn't our agreement.

11:57.802 --> 12:00.930
<i>No, you listen.
This isn't fair, I paid for this cell.</i>

12:01.097 --> 12:02.807
<i>It's mine, you feel me? Mine!</i>

12:06.477 --> 12:09.063
This way, please.

12:14.110 --> 12:17.488
A lot of business going on.
The warden get a cut?

12:17.947 --> 12:19.281
Almost there.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.871
I want the boy scout dead by week's end.

12:36.215 --> 12:39.218
Damn, you look good, brother.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.220
This place agrees with you.

12:41.971 --> 12:45.850
Maybe I'll check in and lose a few pounds.
Hmm? Get a cool tat.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.560
You don't need to check up on me.

12:48.018 --> 12:51.021
You kidding? Highlight of my week
to see your smiling face.

12:52.857 --> 12:55.901
Look, I spoke to Dent,
he's looking into reopening the case.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.486
But you got to keep your nose clean.

12:57.695 --> 13:00.656
Last thing you can do is do more time
'cause you lost your temper, all right?

13:00.865 --> 13:03.367
Shouldn't be that hard,
everyone seems really nice around here.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.369
I've been looking for Penguin,
see what he's got to say.

13:05.536 --> 13:08.164
He's laying low someplace.
But don't worry. I'll find him.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.790
How's Lee?

13:11.125 --> 13:12.918
She's been writing to me a lot.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.547
The letters stopped a few weeks ago.

13:17.715 --> 13:18.883
Know why?

13:22.428 --> 13:24.805
I didn't want to be the one
to tell you this.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.393
Tell me what?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.482
They lost the baby, Jim.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.945
I'm so sorry.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.047
How is she?

14:00.257 --> 14:01.509
I don't know.

14:02.259 --> 14:06.013
I think she's fine. She moved down south.
No one's heard from her since.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.100
Hey. Don't let this beat you.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.440
It was good to see you, Harv.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.442
Jim, I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

14:19.443 --> 14:23.405
Jim, don't let this break you.
Don't give up hope.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.324
Jim! Jim!

14:33.249 --> 14:34.917
Where you going, pig?

14:37.670 --> 14:40.798
My little brother ran with the crew
that pulled off a few bank jobs last year.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.926
The papers called them the Red Hood gang.
Remember them?

14:44.134 --> 14:46.303
You put a bullet in my brother's head.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.888
Whoa!

14:50.099 --> 14:51.308
Who's this?

14:52.101 --> 14:54.311
How about I have my friends
on the outside pay her a visit?

14:54.979 --> 14:57.481
Show her what she's been missing.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.992
Hey, hey, hey guys, cool it, cool it. Huh.

15:08.993 --> 15:10.953
Peace. Peace.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.329
Don't.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.331
It's all right, Mr. Gordon, I got this.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.584
Now, come on now, guys,
let's just take a deep breath.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.336
Yeah!

15:25.884 --> 15:27.511
Get back to your cells!

15:31.181 --> 15:32.182
You!

15:33.183 --> 15:35.853
Assume the position. Now. Now.

15:36.020 --> 15:38.230
<i>- Disperse.</i>
<i>- Back it up. Back it up.</i>

15:39.189 --> 15:43.193
Take inmate Weaver to the hole
and these two to the infirmary.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.321
Get up. Get up.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.031
Let's go. You heard him.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.927
- Father?
- What? Who?

16:50.678 --> 16:53.097
It's okay. You, you were sleepwalking.

16:53.389 --> 16:54.390
Oh.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.225
Oh, I was.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.477
My father's office.

17:00.312 --> 17:05.025
- Here, let me, let me get you a chair.
- No, help me back to bed, won't you?

17:05.401 --> 17:06.527
Of course.

17:17.121 --> 17:18.747
<i>They're for my condition.</i>

17:19.915 --> 17:21.792
- Your heart?
- I have a hole in it.

17:22.793 --> 17:25.003
<i>Keeps getting bigger apparently.</i>

17:25.921 --> 17:27.965
I think my demons are feeding on it.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.138
You have demons?

17:34.471 --> 17:36.348
Sadly, I do.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.893
You, too, I fear.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.105
There is so much I haven't told you.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.316
So much that I'm ashamed of.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.405
I was a criminal.

17:53.282 --> 17:56.535
I've done horrible things.

17:57.911 --> 18:01.707
Hurt people, manipulated, lied.

18:02.833 --> 18:05.377
For power, for revenge.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.051
I've killed people, Father.

18:17.514 --> 18:20.851
Our lives together started
the moment I met you at the cemetery.

18:21.477 --> 18:23.479
Nothing before that concerns me.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.732
I forgive you
for all of your past transgressions.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.028
Be free of them and live here in peace.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.714
We showed them, huh?

18:54.134 --> 18:56.386
- Look, uh, whatever your name is--
- Puck.

18:57.054 --> 19:00.891
Well, Peter, actually.
But people call me Puck.

19:01.225 --> 19:03.644
Stay away from me, okay?
I don't need your help.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.896
Can't do that, Detective Gordon.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.734
- I'm not a detective anymore.
- Oh, I know.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.362
You're way more than that.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.240
You're a true hero.

19:17.282 --> 19:21.119
Two winters ago my little sister
was abducted by child snatchers.

19:22.079 --> 19:23.664
Three days she was gone.

19:24.039 --> 19:27.084
Then you found her,
and you busted the scum that took her.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.295
You saved her life and dozens of others.

19:31.088 --> 19:33.090
Right there, that's a true hero.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.717
I was just doing my job.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.511
No, sir.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.683
- What are you in for?
- A girl.

19:43.767 --> 19:44.893
Beautiful girl.

19:45.644 --> 19:48.939
I asked her out and she said yes.
She was classy.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.692
I couldn't make her take the bus,
so I snatched a car.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.443
Well. Borrowed it.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.573
I was gonna take it back.
Cops didn't believe me.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.533
So, here I am.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.285
What'd they give you?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.996
- Six years.
- Steep.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.164
Hey, I can't complain.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.835
I broke the law, right?
And the law is the law.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.630
I'm not gonna be like my grandfather.
He died in here.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.926
Wouldn't let me and my father visit him
after a while, but finally we did.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.636
Last time I saw him

20:20.470 --> 20:21.805
he was different.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.516
Didn't recognize him.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.311
That's not gonna happen to me, no, sir.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.146
I won't die in here.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.697
Then stay away from me.

20:41.658 --> 20:45.037
What are these prisoners still doing here?
Get them to their cells immediately.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.168
And watch this one.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.671
He just lost a child.

20:56.089 --> 20:59.176
Makes him mad. That's right.

20:59.843 --> 21:03.597
I hear everything, I see everything.

21:03.931 --> 21:07.267
Everything you know, I know.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.187
I know something you don't know.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.397
Yeah? What's that?

21:14.191 --> 21:15.901
I know what kind of man you are.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.115
Get him out of here. Now.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.040
- Gin!
- Oh.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.209
Elijah, brace yourself.

21:33.377 --> 21:35.003
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

21:35.712 --> 21:36.713
Oh, dear.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.590
Charles was at the public library today.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.592
Research for the novel I'm writing.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.179
I was reading some old newspapers
and I made an alarming discovery.

21:44.596 --> 21:48.225
My dear, Oswald is not the nice,
young man he says he is.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.394
If we didn't lead
such sheltered lives here,

21:50.560 --> 21:52.354
we would know what the whole world knows.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.815
He's a notorious criminal.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.776
We've been sheltering a killer.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.074
We could've all been raped
and murdered in our beds.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.534
Raped and murdered.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.664
They call you the Penguin?

22:14.918 --> 22:16.044
To be fair,

22:17.421 --> 22:19.131
I never raped anybody.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.425
Oh, well, that's a mercy, now isn't it?

22:22.175 --> 22:24.094
My son told me about his past.

22:24.886 --> 22:27.014
He just didn't tell me how famous he was.

22:27.431 --> 22:28.974
You're too modest, son.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.811
Elijah. A violent criminal in our house?

22:32.978 --> 22:35.939
Grace, relax. He's changed. Redeemed.

22:36.356 --> 22:39.109
- You're not this man anymore. Are you?
- No, sir.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.237
But how? How do you know?
How do you know he's not?

22:42.404 --> 22:44.114
I've looked into his soul.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.241
I've seen his beautiful heart.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.250
"The Dapper Gangland Kingpin"! Oh!

22:57.627 --> 22:59.046
What now?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.630
What now?

23:02.466 --> 23:03.675
Plan B.

23:04.509 --> 23:05.594
What's plan B?

23:08.472 --> 23:09.806
You are, my dear.

23:21.651 --> 23:22.819
Good morning.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.989
Uh, good morning.

23:27.824 --> 23:31.578
I was hoping to spend
a little time with you, Mr. Penguin.

23:32.204 --> 23:33.663
Okay.

23:33.955 --> 23:37.084
But, um, uh, please, call me Oswald.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.503
I'm not that man anymore.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.047
There isn't a little bit of Penguin left?

23:42.506 --> 23:44.382
A little bad boy?

23:45.383 --> 23:46.426
No.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.346
I got a little bad girl in me.

23:52.015 --> 23:55.060
Whatever you've got planned
for the old man, I want in.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.269
"In"?

23:56.436 --> 23:58.105
We could do great things, you and me.

23:58.688 --> 23:59.689
I suppose. I hadn't--

23:59.856 --> 24:02.400
If you and me work together,
we could have it all.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.444
We could squeeze my mom and brother out.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.654
Why would we do that?

24:06.279 --> 24:07.656
I don't know.

24:08.365 --> 24:11.368
I guess we're just
a couple of crazy, mixed up kids.

24:13.870 --> 24:14.955
Good heavens!

24:15.539 --> 24:18.792
Restrain yourself, woman.
I'm practically your brother.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.210
What are you thinking?

24:27.134 --> 24:28.218
He didn't bite.

24:28.677 --> 24:29.719
Should I try?

24:29.886 --> 24:33.640
No. I don't think he's faking.
I think he's kind of simple.

24:37.644 --> 24:38.687
Huh.

24:47.571 --> 24:50.031
Gordon. Gordon.

24:51.283 --> 24:55.412
Watch yourself.
Weaver's coming out the hole. Now.

24:56.163 --> 24:57.164
Already?

24:57.622 --> 25:00.333
Nothing happens around here
like it's supposed to.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.186
Your day's coming, Gordon.
You're a dead man!

25:20.270 --> 25:23.315
Take a look at your boyfriend over there.

25:26.193 --> 25:27.819
Puck!

25:30.614 --> 25:32.449
Who's gonna help you now, pig?

25:39.080 --> 25:40.624
<i>Hey, you like that, Gordon?</i>

25:47.631 --> 25:50.675
Let it go. Don't extend your sentence.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.484
Ah.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.488
Jim didn't kill that kid, we all know it.
Thing is, who did?

26:12.489 --> 26:14.366
I mean, who'd set him up that way?

26:16.159 --> 26:19.412
I just don't know how much longer
he can stay alive in that place.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.500
I guess I'm asking for your help.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.669
Funny, huh?

26:26.211 --> 26:27.963
You have every right to tell me
to go to hell.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.340
But I...

26:31.716 --> 26:33.593
I got no one else to turn to.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.638
Hmm.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.432
You know, Harvey,

26:40.642 --> 26:42.686
it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.951
You like the fabric? It's Italian.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.203
I love it.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.956
A man can say so much about himself
by what he wears.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.874
I couldn't agree more.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.590
I weep for today's casual youth.

27:22.225 --> 27:25.895
I'm so glad you suggested we do this.
It's been so long.

27:32.277 --> 27:33.278
Are you all right?

27:37.324 --> 27:39.159
Father?

27:39.868 --> 27:42.662
Help! Help! Someone call for an ambulance!

27:42.829 --> 27:44.372
<i>Charles!</i>

27:45.040 --> 27:47.167
<i>Help! Help, Grace!</i>

27:47.625 --> 27:49.210
What did you do to Elijah?

27:50.503 --> 27:51.838
- Nothing.
<i>- Help!</i>

27:52.339 --> 27:56.468
Coming, my dear!
Clean up this mess and call the doctor.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.605
Go on.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.691
Hard at it, I see.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.735
Thanks for getting me my old job back.

28:14.027 --> 28:16.029
Your friend Puck is pretty banged up.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.823
Might do him some good if you were
to come see him in the infirmary.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.118
Yeah, no.

28:22.869 --> 28:23.912
I'm not his friend.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.205
He thinks you are.

28:26.122 --> 28:29.626
The kid's gonna die in here
one way or another.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.300
We'll be quick.

28:48.144 --> 28:49.145
Hey.

28:51.314 --> 28:52.482
How you holding up?

28:53.149 --> 28:54.150
Cool.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.779
They said I have a clot or something.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.573
But I just feel seasick.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.284
Thanks for coming to see me.

29:04.661 --> 29:05.662
Means a lot.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.997
I'm sure they'll take
good care of you in here.

29:09.624 --> 29:11.084
- You hang in there, huh.
- Listen.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.339
Don't give up hope.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.884
I feel your sadness.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.262
I do.

29:24.222 --> 29:26.391
But you gotta choose life, you know?

29:28.852 --> 29:29.894
Okay.

29:31.688 --> 29:32.689
Choose life.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.066
Good.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.362
But listen, kid, uh,

29:41.114 --> 29:42.365
when you get better,

29:43.533 --> 29:46.161
you learn the lesson here
and you stay the hell away from me.

29:48.037 --> 29:50.290
<i>I'm not a hero and I'm not your friend.</i>

29:52.167 --> 29:53.376
I'm just a convict.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.471
Tonight's movie night.

30:04.888 --> 30:07.724
Everyone in the main hall together
with the lights off.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.392
Be ready.

30:10.351 --> 30:13.062
- For what?
- Just be ready.

30:25.158 --> 30:26.576
His condition has gotten worse.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.495
The hole has gotten bigger,

30:28.661 --> 30:30.914
and now there's an infection.

30:31.247 --> 30:33.583
I've given him antibiotics
and rehydrated him,

30:33.833 --> 30:36.628
but I fear it will have
little consequence.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.047
It's time for him
to get his affairs in order.

30:40.215 --> 30:41.424
He may not have long.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.766
I'm going to have them
make you some nice chicken soup.

30:49.933 --> 30:50.934
You need your strength.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.393
How kind.

30:56.439 --> 30:57.607
<i>Come here, my boy.</i>

31:01.778 --> 31:03.279
Don't listen to doctors, son.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.450
<i>I've proved them wrong
so many times I've lost count.</i>

31:08.910 --> 31:11.788
You and I will have many more years
to spend together.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.208
Trust me.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.130
But perhaps we should speak
with my lawyer, dear.

31:22.632 --> 31:24.842
I have some things
I'd like to go over with him.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.136
So much has changed these past weeks.

31:27.762 --> 31:30.807
Of course. I'll have him stop by. Mmm-hmm.

32:27.697 --> 32:29.532
Right.

32:30.533 --> 32:31.618
He's called for his lawyer.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.911
- He's going to change his will?
- Yes.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.789
And when he dies,
Cobblepot will get what's rightfully ours.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.334
<i>That old man was a shriveled up wreck
when I met him.</i>

32:39.500 --> 32:41.044
I made him feel young again.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.339
I brought him back to life,
and what has this gutter rodent done?

32:44.881 --> 32:48.009
Played stupid board games
and whined about his wretched mother.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.387
That vermin has to go.

32:51.846 --> 32:53.389
But he likes it here.

32:54.349 --> 32:55.725
<i>How can we persuade him to go?</i>

32:56.726 --> 32:58.186
How do you get rid of rats?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.482
- Glue traps?
- No, silly.

33:03.691 --> 33:08.112
Hello, hello.
Father is feeling much better,

33:08.279 --> 33:09.864
but he is resting

33:10.198 --> 33:12.116
so he will not be joining us tonight.

33:12.742 --> 33:15.119
Well, that's fine. Let's eat, hmm?

33:16.371 --> 33:18.748
- Thank you.
- Oh...

33:35.723 --> 33:38.309
<i>I'm a pretty bride.
Look, everybody</i>.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.274
Yo, show's over.

33:45.441 --> 33:46.943
Come on, Officer.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.475
Yo, get down.

34:22.645 --> 34:24.439
What are you doing? He's mine!

34:25.898 --> 34:26.941
He's mine.

34:28.568 --> 34:32.280
Stay down. You're dead. You understand?

34:32.864 --> 34:34.574
You understand?

34:36.325 --> 34:37.577
You're done, pig.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.371
Get him out of here.
Clear them out of here.

34:40.538 --> 34:41.539
<i>Come to order.</i>

34:41.706 --> 34:42.999
<i>Get them out of here.</i>

34:50.256 --> 34:51.799
We're gonna need a body bag.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.460
Bullock? What the hell are you doing here?

35:27.627 --> 35:29.378
What's it look like?
We're getting you out of here.

35:29.545 --> 35:30.546
Come on, let's go.

35:30.713 --> 35:32.715
Fake blood, retractable knife.
I can't believe it worked.

35:32.882 --> 35:34.884
Wait. Wait.

35:35.885 --> 35:39.722
Harvey, what if this is
where I'm supposed to be?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.224
What? Let's go.

35:41.516 --> 35:43.726
Bullock.

35:44.685 --> 35:45.937
You sure?

35:46.354 --> 35:47.396
Are you tripping?

35:47.688 --> 35:49.732
A lot of good men put their butts
on a live rail for you.

35:49.899 --> 35:51.567
Me, him, Don freaking Falcone.

35:51.734 --> 35:54.028
Where walking around somewhere is
the guy that killed Pinkney,

35:54.237 --> 35:56.739
framed you and destroyed your family. Hmm?

35:56.948 --> 35:59.742
He's walking around while
you're standing there all blue and misty.

35:59.909 --> 36:01.494
Well, screw your self-pity and let's go!

36:01.661 --> 36:02.745
Amen.

36:03.913 --> 36:04.997
All right.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.501
But I need one more favor.

36:25.601 --> 36:26.602
Hello?

36:29.272 --> 36:30.439
Detective Gordon?

36:30.606 --> 36:31.607
We're out of here.

36:31.816 --> 36:34.026
We need to move as quickly
and quietly as you can.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.445
- You mean like escaping?
- Like that.

36:36.946 --> 36:38.114
But that's against the law.

36:38.281 --> 36:40.908
Yeah. Like you said, choose life.

36:41.492 --> 36:42.952
Told you, didn't I?

36:43.119 --> 36:45.830
Whether you like it or not, you're a hero.

36:48.124 --> 36:51.961
Prisoner Gordon.
You're supposed to be dead.

36:52.962 --> 36:54.380
I'm as surprised as you are.

36:55.089 --> 36:56.966
What brought you back to life?

36:58.009 --> 36:59.760
- Friends.
- Friends.

37:00.928 --> 37:02.680
It's good to have friends.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.683
But where are they
when you need them, huh?

37:09.186 --> 37:10.897
Man, that felt good.

37:12.815 --> 37:15.109
- Sorry I got you into all this.
- Are you kidding?

37:15.276 --> 37:17.528
Never felt more alive. Now.

37:17.945 --> 37:19.363
Hit me hard, make it look good.

37:19.572 --> 37:22.491
Just don't touch the teeth.
I just had them fixed.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.414
My dear mother. She was so young.

37:29.415 --> 37:30.625
Oswald.

37:32.668 --> 37:35.004
Thank you so much, Grace.

37:49.101 --> 37:50.353
I lied to you, son.

37:51.854 --> 37:52.855
Oh.

37:53.773 --> 37:55.524
My father was never physically ill.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.736
He only suffered a deep melancholy.

37:59.946 --> 38:02.073
<i>He was plagued by dark impulses,</i>

38:02.990 --> 38:04.533
evil thoughts of violence.

38:06.786 --> 38:10.039
Mother said many in his family
had the same affliction.

38:15.878 --> 38:17.713
<i>I remember the sound of the gunshot.</i>

38:18.255 --> 38:19.548
<i>I was outside his room.</i>

38:19.715 --> 38:21.592
I screamed for my mother to get the key.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.970
<i>I saw the warm gun in his hand.</i>

38:24.720 --> 38:25.930
The blood.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.182
His face.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.396
Mother said never to talk about it.

38:33.854 --> 38:36.273
<i>For years after the funeral
we never left the house.</i>

38:36.899 --> 38:39.318
I don't pretend to understand
my father's torment.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.239
But I think that perhaps you do.

38:46.075 --> 38:49.620
I feel for you and I beg of you, my son.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.540
Never give in to the pain as he did.

38:53.332 --> 38:54.917
<i>You are loved</i>

38:55.084 --> 38:56.752
and you are not alone.

38:58.421 --> 39:00.548
And the sun will come up tomorrow.

39:03.759 --> 39:05.136
Thank you, Father.

39:08.723 --> 39:10.349
Now, I feel like a drink.

39:12.435 --> 39:13.728
But, but, your health?

39:15.146 --> 39:16.188
To hell with that.

39:23.821 --> 39:25.364
I want you to have it all, my son.

39:26.532 --> 39:27.700
This house and all that's in it.

39:28.743 --> 39:31.537
Keep it just the way it is,
a piece of history,

39:32.955 --> 39:33.956
our history...

39:35.458 --> 39:36.667
Gotham's history.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.546
First thing tomorrow
I'll have my lawyers draw it up.

39:48.971 --> 39:49.972
Father?

39:52.516 --> 39:54.060
- Father, no.
<i>- Elijah!</i>

39:56.645 --> 39:58.481
- Did he, did he drink that?
- Yes.

39:59.023 --> 40:00.900
Why? Why? He's not supposed to.

40:01.067 --> 40:02.943
Sasha, call an ambulance. Call an...

40:13.329 --> 40:16.665
Stay with us, Father,
help is on the way.

40:21.170 --> 40:22.379
No!

40:38.312 --> 40:39.814
We made it, buddy.

40:42.525 --> 40:43.734
Wait here.

40:53.869 --> 40:56.247
Don Falcone had all the contacts
inside of Blackgate.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.374
He made this whole thing happen.

41:02.086 --> 41:03.212
Thank you.

41:04.547 --> 41:05.923
I'm not sure I can ever repay you.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.177
That won't be necessary.
I'm happy to help an old friend.

41:10.678 --> 41:11.971
What now?

41:12.805 --> 41:16.058
You're asking me?
Two hours ago I was a dead man.

41:16.517 --> 41:18.853
I have people that will get you
out of the country.

41:19.019 --> 41:21.397
Or I can arrange
a safe place for you in Gotham.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.232
Your choice.

41:39.582 --> 41:41.000
What do you wanna do?

41:43.043 --> 41:44.503
I wanna go find Lee.

41:46.172 --> 41:48.174
And to do that I have to clear my name.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.093
And to do that
I have to go to back to Gotham.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.387
So there's your answer.

41:57.266 --> 41:58.684
Part of me says run.

42:00.519 --> 42:01.979
<i>I'm breathing fresh air.</i>

42:04.064 --> 42:05.399
I can't go back inside.

42:06.817 --> 42:09.612
If you run, you've got to keep running.

42:11.113 --> 42:12.656
Some people can live with that.

42:15.409 --> 42:18.078
You're a fighter, Jim.
You got knocked down.

42:19.496 --> 42:21.207
Do you stay down?

42:21.790 --> 42:23.709
Or do you get back up?

42:29.215 --> 42:30.591
What do you think, kid?

42:34.595 --> 42:35.596
Puck?

42:38.974 --> 42:42.478
No, no, we made it. Come on, come on, no.

42:42.645 --> 42:44.939
Come on, don't give up. Puck.

42:46.815 --> 42:48.275
He's gone.

42:49.193 --> 42:50.736
Jim, he's gone.

43:58.929 --> 43:59.972
