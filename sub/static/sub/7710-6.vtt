WEBVTT

00:03.274 --> 00:05.779
Where is my desk?

00:07.615 --> 00:09.619
That is weird.

00:09.652 --> 00:12.526
This is not funny.
This is totally unprofessional.

00:12.558 --> 00:14.462
Okay. Well, you're the one
who lost the desk.

00:14.497 --> 00:15.432
I didn't lose
my desk.

00:15.464 --> 00:18.205
Calm down. Where was
the last place you saw it?

00:18.237 --> 00:19.640
Okay, who moved
my desk?

00:19.672 --> 00:21.611
I think you should retrace
your steps.

00:21.644 --> 00:23.380
Okay, I am going

00:23.415 --> 00:24.583
to tell Michael

00:24.617 --> 00:27.423
and this entire office
will be punished.

00:27.455 --> 00:29.293
Colder.

00:31.797 --> 00:34.137
Warmer.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.540
Little warmer.

00:36.574 --> 00:38.477
There you go.
Ooh, warmer.

00:38.510 --> 00:39.713
Warmer.

00:39.747 --> 00:41.717
With enthusiasm.
Warmer.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.155
Warmer. Warmer.

00:43.188 --> 00:44.322
Cold. Cold. Cold.

00:44.357 --> 00:45.359
Back up.

00:46.761 --> 00:49.600
Ooh. Ooh. Warmer.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.871
Hot. Red hot. Hot.

00:51.903 --> 00:54.277
Very hot.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.170
Dwight Schrute.

01:08.205 --> 01:09.473
Hi, Dwight.

01:09.507 --> 01:11.477
Um, what sort of discounts
are we giving

01:11.511 --> 01:12.578
on the 20 pound white?

01:12.613 --> 01:14.682
Jim, I've given you
this information like 20 times.

01:14.717 --> 01:16.221
I know.

01:19.527 --> 01:21.231
It's by the ream?

01:21.264 --> 01:22.565
Uh, yeah.

01:22.598 --> 01:24.636
It is now 9.78.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.606
So it's a discount of 7%.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.845
Okay, thank you.
Gotta get back to work.

01:33.455 --> 01:35.524
Wash your hands, Kevin.

01:38.564 --> 01:46.580
*

02:10.694 --> 02:11.930
Right.

02:11.963 --> 02:14.001
Oh, well, let me just
check the pricing list.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.871
Hold on one second.
Sensei.

02:15.904 --> 02:18.610
Hello, it's sempai.

02:18.645 --> 02:19.647
Dwight.

02:19.679 --> 02:21.951
You know what, let me
give you a call right back.

02:21.983 --> 02:24.357
I'm going to find it
and then I'll call you back.

02:24.390 --> 02:25.491
Thanks.

02:25.525 --> 02:27.562
Yes, I just had a ques--

02:27.596 --> 02:29.533
Yes, sensei.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.371
Arigato goazai mashta.

02:31.404 --> 02:32.605
Hai.

02:35.379 --> 02:36.481
Was that your mom?

02:36.514 --> 02:38.650
No. That was my sensei.

02:38.684 --> 02:41.054
Oh, thought it was
your mom.

02:41.089 --> 02:43.595
I am now sempai,

02:43.627 --> 02:45.764
which is assistant sensei.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.568
Assistant to the sensei,
that's pretty cool.

02:47.603 --> 02:50.040
Assistant sensei.
Okay.

02:50.072 --> 02:52.812
I am a practitioner
of Goju-Ryu Karate

02:52.846 --> 02:54.649
here in Scranton.

02:54.682 --> 02:56.454
Huh!

02:56.487 --> 02:57.588
2.
Huh!

02:57.623 --> 02:59.460
Dwight,
stamp and kick back. 3.

02:59.493 --> 03:00.361
Huh!

03:00.361 --> 03:02.466
My sensei, Ira,

03:02.499 --> 03:04.669
recently promoted me
to purple belt

03:04.703 --> 03:07.709
and gave me the duties
of a sempai.

03:07.743 --> 03:09.546
Not that a lot of people
here in America

03:09.579 --> 03:11.550
know what a sempai is.

03:11.583 --> 03:14.790
But it's equally as respected
as a sensei.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.771
I don't want to stay
until 7:00 again this year.

03:21.803 --> 03:25.579
I don't really have
any control over that, Stanley.

03:29.487 --> 03:33.495
Michael tends
to procrastinate a bit

03:33.528 --> 03:34.963
whenever he has to do work.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.634
Um, time cards.

03:36.666 --> 03:39.170
He has to sign these
every Friday.

03:39.205 --> 03:40.575
Purchase orders
have to be approved

03:40.609 --> 03:42.244
at the end of every month.

03:42.277 --> 03:44.148
And expense reports.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.884
All he has to do
is initial these

03:45.918 --> 03:47.589
at the end of every quarter.

03:47.623 --> 03:50.495
But once a year, it all falls
on the same Friday.

03:50.529 --> 03:52.164
And that's today.

03:52.196 --> 03:54.802
I call it
the perfect storm.

03:54.836 --> 03:57.141
* I don't want to work

03:57.174 --> 04:00.147
* I just want to bang
on this mug all day *

04:00.180 --> 04:01.984
Did you ask me here
for any specific reason?

04:02.016 --> 04:03.588
Ah, yes. I did.

04:03.621 --> 04:05.658
Here's the bizzle.

04:05.692 --> 04:08.898
I have a very top secret
mission for you.

04:08.930 --> 04:11.703
I want you to update all the
emergency contact information.

04:11.737 --> 04:13.273
Why is that secret?

04:14.676 --> 04:15.778
Hello. Oh, God.

04:15.812 --> 04:16.980
Busy work. Get away.
Get away.

04:17.014 --> 04:18.215
Ah, cretin.

04:18.249 --> 04:20.219
Um, I put stickers
so you know where to sign.

04:20.253 --> 04:21.723
Yes, thanks.
I know where to sign.

04:21.757 --> 04:23.595
It's just that last year,
you--

04:23.628 --> 04:25.130
Last year,
they were out of order,

04:25.162 --> 04:26.601
weren't they, Pam?

04:26.634 --> 04:29.170
Well, the last pickup
for overnight deliveries

04:29.205 --> 04:31.844
is at 7:00, so you need
to have them signed by then

04:31.876 --> 04:33.815
or much earlier.

04:33.847 --> 04:36.654
Shalax, Pam.
Stop Pam-MSing.

04:36.687 --> 04:38.156
That's pretty good.

04:38.189 --> 04:39.892
Um, actually,
I'm sending Ryan

04:39.926 --> 04:41.597
on a top secret mission.

04:41.631 --> 04:43.066
Tell her what it is.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.303
Updating emergency contacts.

04:47.241 --> 04:48.910
Well, is that really
a priority?

04:48.944 --> 04:50.180
Is it a priority?

04:50.213 --> 04:51.282
Oh, I don't know.

04:51.315 --> 04:53.655
Um, what if there's
a tornado, Pam?

04:53.688 --> 04:55.659
People's legs are crushed
under rubble.

04:55.692 --> 04:59.131
Please, would you be so kind
as to call my wife?

04:59.165 --> 05:00.400
No. I can't.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.973
Because we don't have any
emergency contact information

05:03.005 --> 05:04.877
because Pam said
it wasn't a priority.

05:04.909 --> 05:06.278
Think.
Think with your head, Pam.

05:06.313 --> 05:07.983
Okay, well, she walks out.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.953
That's the problem
with being a boss

05:09.987 --> 05:12.892
is that when you are tough,
they resent you

05:12.926 --> 05:15.162
and when you are cool,
they walk all over you.

05:15.197 --> 05:17.435
Catch-22.

05:17.467 --> 05:21.677
Catch-22. Yes.

05:23.146 --> 05:24.280
Why don't you give me

05:24.315 --> 05:25.984
your contact information
to start with, okay?

05:26.019 --> 05:28.288
What's your cell?

05:28.323 --> 05:30.027
Uh, Larissa Halpert.

05:30.059 --> 05:31.195
What's her address?

05:31.229 --> 05:34.436
Uh, Vonburgen Street.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.772
Hello.

05:35.805 --> 05:37.975
Hey, Ryan.

05:38.008 --> 05:41.315
This is Michael Jackson

05:41.350 --> 05:43.888
calling from Wonderland.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.492
You mean Neverland?

05:46.525 --> 05:49.466
This is Tito.

05:52.237 --> 05:55.176
What?

05:57.314 --> 05:59.987
Your major and minor lines

06:00.019 --> 06:02.056
cross at a ridge.

06:02.091 --> 06:03.359
That sucks.

06:03.393 --> 06:06.099
You're making this up
as you go along, aren't you?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.435
I am just following
the web site.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.504
Well...

06:08.536 --> 06:10.407
at least I don't
have cavities.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.244
Yes, you have
very nice teeth.

06:12.276 --> 06:14.315
Thanks.

06:14.347 --> 06:16.018
Who's your
emergency contact?

06:16.052 --> 06:18.356
Stacey.

06:22.531 --> 06:24.234
Pick up.

06:26.104 --> 06:27.240
Hello?

06:27.274 --> 06:29.210
Hi, Ryan.

06:29.244 --> 06:31.181
This is Mike Tyson.

06:33.118 --> 06:35.357
Hey, Dwight.

06:35.390 --> 06:39.065
As sempai, do you ever think
there's gonna be a day

06:39.097 --> 06:43.006
where humans and robots
can peacefully coexist?

06:43.038 --> 06:44.409
Impossible.

06:44.442 --> 06:47.113
The way they're programmed...

06:48.450 --> 06:50.855
You're mocking me.
No, I'm not.

06:50.889 --> 06:52.993
Well, let me offer you
a little piece of advice.

06:53.026 --> 06:57.435
I am not afraid
to make an example out of you.

06:57.468 --> 06:59.170
Well, that's not advice.

06:59.204 --> 07:00.841
What advice sounds like
is this.

07:00.841 --> 07:03.981
Um, don't ever bring
your purple belt to work

07:04.014 --> 07:06.352
because someone might
steal it.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.955
Okay, give that back
to me.

07:07.989 --> 07:09.458
Okay, say please.

07:09.491 --> 07:10.594
No. That is not a toy.

07:10.627 --> 07:12.197
Please.
Please.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.436
Good. And it absolutely
is a toy.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.570
Arigato.
Arigato.

07:15.604 --> 07:17.306
This is not a toy.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.077
This is a message

07:19.111 --> 07:21.483
for the entire office
so that everyone

07:21.515 --> 07:22.953
could see
that I am capable

07:22.986 --> 07:24.121
of physically
dominating them.

07:27.394 --> 07:30.501
And this is more
of a yin yang thing.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.272
The Michael is all cursive,
Scott all caps.

07:33.305 --> 07:34.943
Left brain, right brain.

07:34.977 --> 07:37.280
Or a duality of man.

07:38.449 --> 07:41.254
Could you practice
on the forms?

07:45.063 --> 07:47.233
No women or children
unless provoked.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.537
Okay. Roy.

07:48.570 --> 07:50.508
Warehouse guy.
Doesn't count.

07:50.541 --> 07:52.512
Okay. Michael.
Could you beat up Michael?

07:52.545 --> 07:54.347
Yeah, I don't think
that would happen.

07:54.380 --> 07:56.553
Cause we're friends.

07:56.586 --> 07:59.158
Because I would
kick his ass.

07:59.190 --> 08:00.494
Well, Dwight's
purple belt.

08:00.528 --> 08:02.665
So? I've beat up
black belts. Yeah.

08:02.698 --> 08:05.069
How'd you know
they were black belts?

08:05.103 --> 08:07.041
They told me after.

08:07.774 --> 08:10.012
See, I used to run
with a very tough crowd,

08:10.047 --> 08:11.282
street fighter types.

08:11.315 --> 08:13.619
Real, real bad people.

08:13.653 --> 08:16.625
I'm just lucky I got out.

08:16.659 --> 08:18.696
Is your wife
still your contact?

08:18.730 --> 08:21.134
Uh, ex-wife, yeah.

08:21.169 --> 08:24.809
Uh, her last name
is Becker now.

08:24.841 --> 08:26.813
Okay.

08:26.845 --> 08:29.051
You don't need
to write "ex".

08:29.085 --> 08:30.688
And after that,

08:30.720 --> 08:34.529
nobody ever messed with
the damn rascals ever again.

08:34.562 --> 08:35.798
Sounds tough.

08:35.830 --> 08:37.635
When you're a Jet,

08:37.668 --> 08:39.806
you're a Jet all the way,
right?
You're a Jet?

08:39.838 --> 08:41.341
Have you signed
the expense reports yet?

08:41.374 --> 08:42.612
Yes, in theory I have.

08:42.645 --> 08:45.482
I just need to cross
some Ts and dot some Is.

08:45.516 --> 08:48.223
All right.

08:48.256 --> 08:50.093
I am going to be
in my office,

08:50.127 --> 08:52.565
if anybody needs me.

08:52.598 --> 08:53.866
Hoo! Ha!

08:53.899 --> 08:55.537
Oh, wow.
Michael.

08:55.571 --> 08:57.742
Sleeper hold.
Bed time for vato.

08:57.775 --> 08:59.111
Oh.

08:59.145 --> 09:00.347
Stop it.

09:00.379 --> 09:01.081
Oh ho ho ho.

09:01.081 --> 09:02.885
You are the weakest link.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.254
Ow!

09:04.288 --> 09:06.258
I'm friends with everybody
in this office.

09:06.292 --> 09:09.331
We're all best friends.
I love everybody here.

09:09.364 --> 09:12.804
But sometimes
your best friends

09:12.838 --> 09:14.909
start coming in
to work late

09:14.942 --> 09:16.680
and start having dentist
appointments

09:16.712 --> 09:18.349
that aren't dentist
appointments.

09:18.382 --> 09:20.552
And that is when it's nice
to let them know

09:20.587 --> 09:22.692
that you could
beat them up.

09:22.725 --> 09:23.826
Just hit me.
You'll see.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.197
I can't.

09:25.230 --> 09:27.301
Cause I just got a manicure.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.771
Oh, queer!
Eye. Queer Eye.

09:29.806 --> 09:31.775
That's a good show.
Important show.

09:31.810 --> 09:32.945
Go ahead. Do it.

09:32.977 --> 09:34.916
Just have Dwight punch you.

09:34.948 --> 09:36.720
Oh, yeah. Well, that would
be kind of worthless

09:36.753 --> 09:38.724
because I know
a ton of 14-year-old girls

09:38.757 --> 09:40.459
who could kick his ass.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.231
You know a ton
of 14-year-old girls.

09:43.899 --> 09:44.400
Look. Dwight is a wuss.

09:45.068 --> 09:46.339
When we rented Armageddon,

09:46.372 --> 09:47.974
he cried at the end of it.

09:48.007 --> 09:49.846
No, Michael,
I told you.

09:49.879 --> 09:51.514
That was because
it was New Year's Eve

09:51.548 --> 09:53.253
and it started to snow
at exactly midnight.

09:53.286 --> 09:54.388
Bruce Willis.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.858
They're going to leave him
on the asteroid.

09:55.891 --> 09:57.227
Okay, I'll punch you.

09:57.261 --> 09:58.428
Oh, okay.
Here we go.

09:58.463 --> 09:59.766
All right. Come on.

09:59.799 --> 10:00.768
Gah!

10:02.938 --> 10:05.778
Oh!

10:05.810 --> 10:07.012
Did I want to harm Michael,

10:07.046 --> 10:09.384
the one man
I've been hired to protect?

10:09.417 --> 10:10.853
No, I did not.

10:10.887 --> 10:11.855
Are you okay?

10:11.889 --> 10:12.857
Yes.

10:12.891 --> 10:14.327
Are you sure
you're all right?

10:14.360 --> 10:15.798
Yeah. Yeah.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.001
Thank you.

10:22.944 --> 10:24.648
I come from a long line
of fighters.

10:24.681 --> 10:25.883
My maternal grandfather

10:25.918 --> 10:27.453
was the toughest guy
I ever knew.

10:27.487 --> 10:28.857
World War II veteran.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.895
Killed 20 men
then spent the rest of the war

10:31.930 --> 10:33.733
in an allied prison camp.

10:33.767 --> 10:37.908
My father battled
blood pressure and obesity

10:37.942 --> 10:39.445
all his life.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.916
Different kind of fight.

10:41.950 --> 10:44.956
Okay, he has
to be stopped.

10:44.989 --> 10:47.928
Please, please, please,
please, just ask Michael.

10:49.731 --> 10:51.634
I don't know.

10:51.669 --> 10:53.439
Ha.

10:54.909 --> 10:56.846
Okay. I'll buy you
a bag of chips.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.114
French onion?

10:58.147 --> 10:59.886
Obviously.
Why are you spinning
around?

10:59.919 --> 11:01.321
Okay.
Yes.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.859
Take this pen.

11:06.733 --> 11:07.767
Go away.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.904
I just have
a quick question.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.710
I haven't signed them yet,
okay?

11:11.743 --> 11:13.378
No, it's not that.

11:13.413 --> 11:15.048
Um, I was just wondering,

11:15.082 --> 11:17.052
since I'm probably going
to have to stay late,

11:17.086 --> 11:18.890
could you ask Dwight
to stay late too

11:18.924 --> 11:21.730
so he can walk me
to my car?

11:23.867 --> 11:26.873
Come in.

11:26.906 --> 11:28.175
Uh, Pam,

11:28.207 --> 11:29.879
I hate to break this
to you,

11:29.912 --> 11:31.883
but Dwight can't stop you
from being mugged.

11:31.916 --> 11:33.753
He's just not
tough enough.

11:33.786 --> 11:35.757
He's a purple belt.
That's really high.

11:35.790 --> 11:37.594
Oh, I could beat up Dwight.
That's ridiculous.

11:37.626 --> 11:39.196
I can murder him.

11:39.229 --> 11:41.034
It's just that out there,
you...

11:41.068 --> 11:42.504
Oh, is that what
they're saying?

11:42.537 --> 11:44.608
Yeah, kind of.
Okay. All right.

11:45.877 --> 11:47.046
Where's Dwight?
Uh, kitchen.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.017
Okay.

11:52.925 --> 11:54.226
Try it again. Here we go.

11:54.259 --> 11:55.763
Hi-yah!
Good.

11:55.797 --> 11:57.066
Wow, it was actually
pretty good, right?

11:57.100 --> 11:58.869
Excellent. Now watch.
Let me take you from behind.

11:58.903 --> 12:00.039
What?
Watch out, Kelly.

12:00.072 --> 12:01.441
Might sucker punch you.

12:01.441 --> 12:03.478
I didn't sucker punch you,
Michael.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.115
No, really?

12:05.149 --> 12:07.185
In case you didn't remember,
I was defending my honor.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.555
Like a samurai.
Really?

12:08.589 --> 12:09.826
Yeah.
Well, the offer,
Dwight,

12:09.859 --> 12:12.062
was for one punch,
which I absorbed.

12:12.095 --> 12:14.769
I had no idea that there'd be
a second punch.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.905
So catch-22.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.911
Okay, fine. Tit for tit.

12:19.945 --> 12:23.018
Give it your best shot.
Two punches. Go.

12:23.052 --> 12:25.022
Look. If we were in a bar
right now,

12:25.056 --> 12:25.991
there would be two punches.

12:26.024 --> 12:28.062
Me punching you
and you hitting the floor.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.263
No, I'd block
your first punch

12:29.297 --> 12:30.801
rendering you ineffective.
Oh, really?

12:30.833 --> 12:31.870
Yeah.
You know what,

12:31.902 --> 12:34.040
you're just lucky
that we're at work right now.

12:34.074 --> 12:35.009
Ooh, what about
Dwight's dojo?

12:35.042 --> 12:36.979
No, they just have classes.

12:37.013 --> 12:38.784
It's free during the day.
It's fine.

12:38.816 --> 12:39.918
I've got the key.
Hey, Michael.

12:39.951 --> 12:42.090
Hey, Toby.
Any word
on those time cards?

12:42.123 --> 12:44.127
Hey, you know what?
I have an idea.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.830
Why don't you leave
right now?

12:45.863 --> 12:47.867
Why don't you walk
away from the room, okay?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.571
Fine.

12:49.605 --> 12:51.273
We'll go at lunch.

12:51.308 --> 12:54.114
Pam, make an announcement.

12:54.147 --> 12:56.752
Figure out carpools.

12:58.889 --> 13:00.860
Um, well, we're all
getting excited

13:00.893 --> 13:02.731
to see this fight.

13:02.763 --> 13:04.902
The Albany Branch is working
right through lunch

13:04.936 --> 13:05.870
to prevent downsizing.

13:05.904 --> 13:08.075
But Michael, he decided
to extend our lunch

13:08.108 --> 13:11.781
by an hour so that we could
all go down to the dojo

13:11.816 --> 13:13.785
and watch him fight Dwight.

13:13.820 --> 13:17.861
Fight. Fight.
Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

13:17.895 --> 13:19.966
Fight. I'm coming. Fight.

13:23.405 --> 13:24.909
Sorry.

13:32.992 --> 13:34.426
I recognize that.

13:34.459 --> 13:37.032
That is Japanese
for California roll.

13:37.065 --> 13:38.235
Uh, no, it's not.

13:38.268 --> 13:40.371
I think it is.
A guy told me about that.

13:40.406 --> 13:42.075
Actually, it's a symbol
for eternal discipline.

13:42.109 --> 13:43.377
Oh.

13:43.412 --> 13:44.916
Wow. That is really
interesting.

13:44.948 --> 13:46.083
What?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.220
Your love l--
I'm just kidding.

13:47.253 --> 13:48.355
I can't see anything.

13:48.387 --> 13:50.292
Look closer.

13:50.326 --> 13:51.762
Okay.

13:51.795 --> 13:52.831
One point for me.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.200
Tied up.
Oh, you're dead.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.401
What? What are you
going to do?

13:55.436 --> 13:56.470
Bring it, Beesly.
Bring it.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.141
Ooh, yeah. Good move.

13:58.175 --> 14:00.279
Ooh, not such
an ultimate fighter now, huh?

14:00.312 --> 14:01.681
Oh, put me down.

14:01.681 --> 14:03.252
Put me down.

14:03.285 --> 14:04.788
Oh my God.
Hey, put me down.

14:04.821 --> 14:06.925
Hey.

14:10.867 --> 14:12.402
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.076
After a clean strike
to the chest,

14:15.109 --> 14:17.180
stomach, or kidneys,

14:17.213 --> 14:19.149
I will separate you
and award a point.

14:19.183 --> 14:20.753
First person
to three wins, all right?

14:20.787 --> 14:22.323
Yes, sensei.
Lot of rules.

14:22.355 --> 14:24.795
Lot of rules. On the street,
we didn't have any rules.

14:24.828 --> 14:26.197
Maybe one. No kicks
to the groin.

14:26.231 --> 14:27.432
Home for dinner.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.871
Hajime!
Ha-yah!

14:29.906 --> 14:31.440
Whoa, hey!
What the hell was that?

14:31.474 --> 14:32.978
Dwight.
Yes!

14:33.011 --> 14:34.146
No way.
One point.

14:34.179 --> 14:36.183
All right. That's the way you
want to do it?

14:36.217 --> 14:38.455
Two more!
You want to play dirty, huh?
Okay, game on, man.

14:38.487 --> 14:40.125
Sweep the leg.

14:40.158 --> 14:41.328
I'm coming
at you, man.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.275
Ha!
Okay, purple belt.

14:48.308 --> 14:51.281
Okay.
I got it.

14:51.314 --> 14:52.483
No.
I got his pants.

14:52.515 --> 14:54.956
That was my pants.
No points for pants.

14:56.458 --> 14:57.827
Dwight, you have--
No, look.

14:57.861 --> 15:00.165
No, you have something.
You have something.

15:00.198 --> 15:01.801
God, you look like such
an idiot.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.953
Hoo! Ha ha!

15:10.987 --> 15:11.788
Clean technique,
gentlemen.

15:11.821 --> 15:13.424
Come on. Do that again.
Do that again.

15:13.457 --> 15:14.593
I dare you.

15:14.627 --> 15:16.899
Ha!

15:16.932 --> 15:19.337
Okay, break.
Break. No holding.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.975
Oh, you can't see?
You can't see?

15:22.010 --> 15:24.179
One point. Two points.
Three points.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.283
Break.

15:26.317 --> 15:28.422
I win. I win.

15:28.455 --> 15:31.161
No, you didn't.

15:31.193 --> 15:32.596
No you--

15:32.629 --> 15:34.299
Eight point.
Nine point.

15:36.138 --> 15:37.473
Stop it. No.

15:37.506 --> 15:39.243
Come on. Michael!

15:39.276 --> 15:40.546
Open your mouth.
No, Michael!

15:57.080 --> 16:01.387
You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me?

16:01.421 --> 16:03.425
Raging Bull. Pacino.

16:03.457 --> 16:05.296
Oh, I want that footage.
I want it.

16:05.328 --> 16:06.331
I need it.

16:06.363 --> 16:08.202
Oh, I have to get back
to work.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.736
I have lots of work.
Oh, oh, oh.

16:09.770 --> 16:11.373
Check this out.
Come here.

16:11.408 --> 16:14.213
There he is.
Mr. temp.

16:14.247 --> 16:17.385
Having lunch by the car.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.389
Let us play with him.

16:19.423 --> 16:20.692
See what we can learn.

16:28.475 --> 16:31.581
Oh we're playing
phone tag.

16:31.613 --> 16:33.285
Seven new messages.

16:33.317 --> 16:34.419
First new message.

16:34.453 --> 16:38.461
Hi, Ryan. This is
Saddam Hussein.

16:38.495 --> 16:40.398
Next message.

16:40.431 --> 16:42.235
Hey, Ryan. This is
your girlfriend.

16:42.270 --> 16:44.607
And I'm mad.

17:06.318 --> 17:09.624
My emergency contact
is Tod Pecker.

17:09.656 --> 17:12.563
Tod F. Pecker.

17:12.595 --> 17:14.599
You know what
the F standings for?
Fudge?

17:16.304 --> 17:18.308
Uh, come in.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.746
Oh, hey, Karate Kid.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.349
The Hilary Swank
version.

17:22.383 --> 17:24.154
Hi. How are you?

17:24.187 --> 17:26.523
I need to change my emergency
contact information

17:26.557 --> 17:28.427
from Michael Scott.

17:28.462 --> 17:30.498
Okay, to what?

17:30.531 --> 17:33.472
Just put...the hospital.

17:33.504 --> 17:37.280
Contact number,
just put 911.

17:37.313 --> 17:38.815
[pen scratching out
information]

17:38.847 --> 17:41.154
He is such a sore loser.

17:41.188 --> 17:42.455
You heard obviously

17:42.489 --> 17:45.262
that I mopped the floor
with him this afternoon.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.802
You know what,
um, do yourself a favor.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.272
Just leave me
as his contact

17:50.306 --> 17:52.276
and I will call
the hospital.

17:52.310 --> 17:53.511
Cut out the middleman.

17:53.544 --> 17:56.318
[pen scratching out
information]

18:03.998 --> 18:04.966
Later, Jim.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.671
Later, Kev.

18:13.451 --> 18:14.353
Have a good weekend.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.390
Yeah, you too.

18:26.843 --> 18:28.748
Yeah.

18:28.782 --> 18:30.351
Have the emergency
contacts.

18:30.386 --> 18:31.853
Just lay 'em
on the chair.

18:31.888 --> 18:33.991
I'll take it from here.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.929
So what you up to
this weekend?

18:35.961 --> 18:38.935
Uh, hanging out
with some friends probably.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.607
Well, if you do anything crazy,
give me a shout.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.544
Yeah. All right.
I will, um, see you Monday.

18:43.577 --> 18:45.981
All right. Bye.

18:54.032 --> 18:54.999
Dwight.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.570
Michael,
did you finish yet?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.842
This close. Dwight, may I
speak with you for a minute?

18:58.875 --> 19:00.379
Uh, I'm busy.

19:00.412 --> 19:02.282
Well, busier.
But I'm making the time.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.387
Michael, can't your
conversation wait till Monday?

19:04.420 --> 19:06.088
We want to go home.

19:06.122 --> 19:08.628
Well, you don't even have
anybody to go home to, Toby.

19:08.662 --> 19:11.467
The shipping place closes
in a half hour.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.339
I know. But I've been carrying
the load on my back all day.

19:14.374 --> 19:17.845
And if everyone would just
chip in a little bit,

19:17.880 --> 19:20.083
might help me out.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.554
What do you say?

19:21.587 --> 19:23.558
Let's gang bang
this thing and go home.

19:23.591 --> 19:25.026
Good? Dwight.

19:31.673 --> 19:32.809
This is illegal.

19:32.843 --> 19:34.414
I don't care.

19:37.585 --> 19:39.557
I have been testing you
the entire day.

19:39.589 --> 19:41.394
Did you know that?

19:41.428 --> 19:45.469
Of course.

19:45.502 --> 19:47.672
And I'm happy to say
that you passed.

19:47.705 --> 19:49.410
So effective immediately,

19:49.444 --> 19:50.546
I am promoting you

19:50.579 --> 19:53.452
from assistant
to the regional manager

19:53.485 --> 19:57.158
to assistant
regional manager.

19:57.190 --> 20:00.097
Michael...

20:00.129 --> 20:01.700
I don't know--

20:01.733 --> 20:02.402
I know. I know. I know.
I know.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.640
I wouldn't be offering it

20:04.673 --> 20:06.444
if I didn't think
you could handle it.

20:06.478 --> 20:07.780
I can handle it.
I can.

20:07.813 --> 20:09.450
I know. Okay.

20:09.484 --> 20:11.721
Wow.

20:11.754 --> 20:14.191
So I guess this'll
just be my office.

20:14.226 --> 20:15.961
No.

20:15.996 --> 20:17.965
No. Title change only.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.470
I'll have Pam
send out a memo.

20:19.504 --> 20:21.808
No. No. Three month
probationary period.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.911
Let's just not tell anybody
about this right now.

20:23.945 --> 20:25.248
Just a formality?

20:25.280 --> 20:27.620
Absolutely.
But not really.

20:27.652 --> 20:29.154
Michael...

20:32.662 --> 20:36.671
I have so much
to learn from you.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.807
Yes, you do.

20:41.648 --> 20:44.620
Thank you...

20:44.654 --> 20:47.158
sensei.

20:49.328 --> 20:52.902
And ditto.

20:52.935 --> 20:54.172
I told Dwight

20:54.205 --> 20:55.808
that there is honor
in losing,

20:55.841 --> 20:58.782
which as we all know
is completely ridiculous.

20:58.814 --> 21:02.121
But there is however honor
in making a loser feel better,

21:02.154 --> 21:05.094
which is what I just did
for Dwight.

21:05.127 --> 21:09.201
Would I rather be
feared or loved?

21:09.235 --> 21:10.772
Um, easy. Both.

21:10.805 --> 21:13.612
I want people to be afraid
of how much they love me.

21:13.644 --> 21:17.585
And I think I proved that today
at the dojo.

21:17.620 --> 21:18.722
Typewriter torture.

21:18.754 --> 21:20.023
Sensei, help.
Typewriter torture.

21:20.057 --> 21:22.061
No.
Typewriter.
