WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:02.668
Someone is unleashing

00:02.669 --> 00:05.404
<i>unspeakable evils in our capital city.</i>

00:05.405 --> 00:08.039
The girl from the vision
is Diana's daughter?

00:08.041 --> 00:09.408
Molly is the next Witness.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.043
<i>How does one bring an innocent child</i>

00:11.044 --> 00:13.212
<i>into the battle between good and evil?</i>

00:13.213 --> 00:15.848
Don't be fooled by his genteel accent.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.716
<i>Ichabod Crane is keeping secrets.</i>

00:17.717 --> 00:18.884
Where are we on finding.

00:18.885 --> 00:21.220
<i>Ichabod Crane's compatriot?</i>

00:21.221 --> 00:24.823
<i>He's headed this way,
and if his reputation holds true,</i>

00:24.824 --> 00:26.425
<i>death and destruction will follow.</i>

00:35.602 --> 00:37.636
What fell acts have transpired

00:37.637 --> 00:40.038
in this dread den of horrors?

00:41.674 --> 00:44.910
The last tenant disappeared
under mysterious circum...

00:44.911 --> 00:46.078
stances.

00:48.181 --> 00:49.815
The bastard owed me
two months rent, too.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.950
Musician.

00:51.951 --> 00:55.454
You're not one of those, right?

00:55.455 --> 00:57.156
Not by trade, no.

00:57.157 --> 01:00.392
I was assured a walk-in closet.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.362
Well, you could walk
in there if you wanted to.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.567
Didn't the ad also specify
the place has great light?

01:08.568 --> 01:09.802
Sunlight gives you cancer.

01:09.803 --> 01:13.138
And what of these
so-called "stunning views"?

01:13.139 --> 01:15.939
There's a neighbor that
showers with her shades up.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.011
It's a little rundown, sure, all right,

01:19.012 --> 01:21.280
but this is an "edge"
neighborhood, okay?

01:21.281 --> 01:23.849
In two years, this whole block will be

01:23.850 --> 01:26.819
just cupcake joints and record stores.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.322
And that's right up your O.G.
hipster-vibe alley, Mr. Crane.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.523
My...

01:31.524 --> 01:33.625
How have I not seen that before?

01:33.626 --> 01:36.128
The facial hair and the boots and

01:36.129 --> 01:37.496
a proclivity towards

01:37.497 --> 01:38.880
- obscure doughnut toppings.
- Yes.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.799
If valuing progressive politics,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.467
counter-cultural initiatives

01:42.468 --> 01:46.305
and maple-glazed bacon
marks me as a hirsute hepcat,

01:46.306 --> 01:49.007
then so be it, but this is
still not the property for me.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.409
Well, it's one-fourth the rent

01:50.410 --> 01:52.144
of the other seven places you saw.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.879
I'll take it.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.314
Okay.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.866
Hey, man, now that we're neighbors,

02:03.867 --> 02:06.558
we can bro down, hang out,
Chill-doh Baggins.

02:06.559 --> 02:09.961
Yes, indeed. I look forward to that.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.131
I greatly appreciate your assistance

02:13.132 --> 02:15.801
in finding a suitable
abode, Master Wells.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.503
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll catch you later.

02:18.504 --> 02:22.007
Um, Jenny Mills?

02:23.142 --> 02:25.577
Jake Wells.

02:26.980 --> 02:31.249
Our names are... similar.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.859
And onwards.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.228
Hey, you got the apartment,

02:43.229 --> 02:44.563
you got the Vault.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.365
We know who the next Witness is.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.533
When are you gonna tell
Diana about Molly?

02:48.534 --> 02:51.335
Agent Thomas has endured
considerable hardship

02:51.336 --> 02:52.159
with her daughter...

02:52.160 --> 02:54.595
The road is not gonna get any smoother.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.243
I have a feeling you're going to tell me

02:58.244 --> 03:01.480
to pull off the Band-Aid.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.849
Sooner rather than later.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.653
You have a pretty neck, Mom.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.890
Coming from a young Modigliani,

03:11.891 --> 03:13.692
I take that as a high compliment.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.761
That's a... that's a really nice one.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.304
Can I see what you've been up to?

03:19.532 --> 03:20.799
Wow.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.205
You can have this one if you want.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.141
I just work with him, Molly.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.811
Wait.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.949
You mostly just draw
people, not places.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.183
Where'd you see this, baby?

03:42.355 --> 03:45.824
You're gonna be late, Mom.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.259
Okay, you're right. Let's go.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.694
I'll drive you to Nanny Clara's.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.797
Can't I just stay home?
I'm 11 years old.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.265
- Not yet.
- Almost.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.666
Go.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.202
You might be ready, I'm not.

04:02.241 --> 04:03.834
<i>The algorithm is adaptive.</i>

04:03.835 --> 04:05.310
So it generates predictive

04:05.311 --> 04:07.212
flashpoints based on query input.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.081
Not unlike a crystal ball.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.716
Actually, that's what
we're calling the app.

04:11.717 --> 04:13.756
And we've had lots
of bites on the west coast,

04:13.757 --> 04:14.853
but no lead investor yet.

04:14.854 --> 04:18.190
Yeah, it's a risk-averse
world out there, isn't it?

04:18.190 --> 04:19.291
But you know what?

04:19.291 --> 04:21.125
I can get you funded

04:21.127 --> 04:23.428
with just one phone call.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.931
But I won't.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.767
- Mr. Dreyfuss, if it's...
- No, no, no.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.103
It's not your software,
it's not the financials.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.272
It's your... vision.

04:34.273 --> 04:36.441
See, this company of yours

04:36.442 --> 04:38.310
has a ten-year plan.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.345
But where's your 50-year plan?

04:40.346 --> 04:42.814
Your hundred, your thousand-year plan?

04:42.815 --> 04:44.149
I'm not looking to cash in

04:44.150 --> 04:45.984
on the next round of junk bonds

04:45.985 --> 04:47.886
or penny stocks.

04:47.887 --> 04:52.090
I am investing in no
less than the future

04:52.091 --> 04:53.825
of the human race.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.894
You wanted to be
informed when he arrived,

04:55.895 --> 04:58.463
Mr. Dreyfuss.

05:03.302 --> 05:06.037
Do people still use
drawing boards these days?

05:13.346 --> 05:14.780
So he's here?

05:14.781 --> 05:18.216
Any idea yet why he's
come down to D.C.?

05:18.217 --> 05:20.085
We won't have to wait long to find out.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.320
As soon as the sun sets,
he'll be on the move.

05:22.321 --> 05:25.424
That's right. And when he arrives,

05:25.425 --> 05:28.360
death and mayhem are sure to follow.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.663
Friday night lights, people.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.332
Get your popcorn and your beer cozy,

05:34.333 --> 05:36.535
your cherry cola floats.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.637
The fun is about to begin.

05:48.448 --> 05:51.383
ETA 25 minutes, Madam President.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.432
Code 9. Get down, Madam President!

06:49.675 --> 06:52.577
I shot him point blank,

06:52.578 --> 06:56.448
and his head... fell off.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.783
I know this sounds insane,

06:58.784 --> 07:01.887
but this horseman,
he was headless, right?

07:01.888 --> 07:05.724
And he kept coming.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.096
The whole city's on lockdown.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.231
DHS, Secret Service,

07:13.232 --> 07:15.934
local PD all on red alert
looking for the bad guys

07:15.935 --> 07:17.836
who took a potshot at POTUS.

07:17.837 --> 07:20.405
And all we have to go on
is a dead escort driver,

07:20.406 --> 07:22.010
and another one who everyone thinks

07:22.011 --> 07:23.475
is concussed and talking crazy.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.677
But you think differently?

07:27.446 --> 07:30.282
I'm the only one who sees
another possibility.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.783
And you're the closet thing I have

07:31.784 --> 07:34.953
to an expert on this
brand of craziness.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.455
I've seen a demon

07:37.456 --> 07:41.026
and witches...

07:41.027 --> 07:43.895
but there's more
out there, isn't there?

07:43.896 --> 07:45.330
More monsters?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.734
This guy's telling the truth, isn't he?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.406
Did the assailant carry an axe?

07:54.407 --> 07:57.976
The escort driver said he was carrying

07:57.977 --> 08:00.245
a glowing, red-hot axe.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.282
You know what this thing is?

08:04.283 --> 08:07.285
An abomination.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.987
He goes by many different names

08:08.988 --> 08:10.622
in many different incarnations,

08:10.623 --> 08:13.391
but is unerring in his determination.

08:13.392 --> 08:14.993
If the Horseman has set his sights

08:14.994 --> 08:17.796
on the president of the United States,

08:17.797 --> 08:20.999
nothing will deter him from his goal.

08:22.134 --> 08:23.668
In other news,

08:23.669 --> 08:25.236
it's only Monday.

09:01.111 --> 09:02.578
<i>Soulless blackguard.</i>

09:07.584 --> 09:09.151
<i>Merciless killer.</i>

09:11.988 --> 09:13.922
<i>Death incarnate.</i>

09:19.496 --> 09:22.297
<i>Dark Rider of the Apocalypse.</i>

09:23.933 --> 09:26.201
<i>This is the creature we face.</i>

09:26.202 --> 09:29.505
The Horseman cannot be reasoned with.

09:29.506 --> 09:33.175
He is a single-minded
engine of destruction,

09:33.176 --> 09:36.612
and woe to all those
who cross his path.

09:36.613 --> 09:38.514
Something tells me you're about to say

09:38.515 --> 09:40.048
we're gonna cross it anyway.

09:40.049 --> 09:42.384
I figured the bastard
would show lack of a face

09:42.385 --> 09:43.785
sooner or later.

09:43.786 --> 09:46.054
Okay, I have practical questions.

09:46.055 --> 09:48.557
No head, right? So how does he breathe?

09:48.558 --> 09:49.658
How does he communicate?

09:49.659 --> 09:50.993
Is there, like, a utility neck hole?

09:50.994 --> 09:52.507
I need to know what I'm working with.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.531
More importantly, this thing
is after the president

09:54.532 --> 09:56.899
of the United States. Why?

09:56.900 --> 09:58.800
The Horseman's sole purpose in the past

09:58.801 --> 10:01.603
has been to retrieve his head.

10:01.604 --> 10:04.339
The Norse myth of Mimir.

10:04.340 --> 10:06.642
He was a god who got his head cut off

10:06.643 --> 10:08.110
in a god war, right?

10:08.111 --> 10:10.345
And the king of the gods
had it embalmed with herbs

10:10.346 --> 10:12.181
and preserved the head so that...

10:12.182 --> 10:13.949
Pickled god heads, dude?

10:13.950 --> 10:16.051
Tell me this is going somewhere.

10:16.052 --> 10:17.886
The heads of royalty
have been considered

10:17.887 --> 10:19.955
powerful totems by many cultures.

10:19.956 --> 10:21.884
The pygmies have the whole
shrunken-head thing.

10:21.885 --> 10:23.522
Yeah, see, the more
important the person,

10:23.523 --> 10:24.590
the more juju in the head.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.962
Many cultures believe heads of state

10:26.963 --> 10:29.164
possess magical qualities.

10:29.165 --> 10:31.466
The Horseman seeks
the president's head.

10:31.467 --> 10:33.402
But how do we stop him?

10:33.403 --> 10:34.803
The escort driver's testimony said

10:34.804 --> 10:36.667
when the Horseman went
for the president, he...

10:36.668 --> 10:39.508
He reached a barrier he could not pass.

10:39.509 --> 10:41.533
Perhaps a more thorough
investigation of the street

10:41.534 --> 10:43.812
where the Horseman attacked
the president is in order.

10:43.813 --> 10:45.247
Ho-hold on, hold on.

10:45.248 --> 10:46.951
We're talking about an
active investigation

10:46.952 --> 10:49.284
of a presidential
assassination attempt.

10:49.285 --> 10:51.353
I might be able to get
you on the scene, Crane,

10:51.354 --> 10:53.121
but not a small army.

10:53.122 --> 10:55.724
Um, can you

10:55.725 --> 10:58.126
boost a signal in an RT-196

10:58.127 --> 10:59.628
through three feet of concrete?

10:59.629 --> 11:01.129
Future me already has.

11:01.130 --> 11:02.831
Well, then, I know how we can be there

11:02.832 --> 11:04.666
and not be there at the same time.

11:06.469 --> 11:08.971
No group has stepped up
to take credit for the attack

11:08.972 --> 11:10.572
on our commander in chief.

11:10.573 --> 11:13.242
Could this be the work
of a lone gunman?

11:13.243 --> 11:14.977
One escort driver went down,

11:14.978 --> 11:18.046
and the other fought back over there.

11:18.047 --> 11:20.115
Horseman went after the motorcade,

11:20.116 --> 11:21.950
then something stopped him.

11:24.420 --> 11:27.556
30 paces west.

11:27.557 --> 11:29.191
Copy that.

11:29.192 --> 11:30.792
Well, still think mapping

11:30.793 --> 11:32.694
these tunnels was a waste of time?

11:32.695 --> 11:34.563
Not how I'd spend my weekend.

11:34.564 --> 11:35.697
Hey, hold up.

11:35.698 --> 11:37.933
Know anything about glyphs and wards?

11:37.934 --> 11:40.035
Um, only that wards can be glyphs,

11:40.036 --> 11:42.237
but glyphs aren't necessarily wards.

11:42.238 --> 11:43.705
And the one you're standing on?

11:45.208 --> 11:47.476
Whoa.

11:47.477 --> 11:49.044
It's Mayan.

11:49.045 --> 11:50.712
Hoy is used

11:50.713 --> 11:52.047
to bless or sanctify.

11:52.048 --> 11:53.515
There's another over here.

11:53.516 --> 11:55.584
These were carved centuries ago.

11:55.585 --> 11:56.752
Druidic.

11:56.753 --> 11:58.186
<i>Duir, the oak.</i>

11:58.187 --> 12:00.389
A rune used to unlock the way.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.691
You...

12:02.692 --> 12:04.693
know your runes.

12:05.695 --> 12:08.363
You keep eyeballing me like that,

12:08.364 --> 12:10.031
you'll lose an eye.

12:16.873 --> 12:19.808
You are so not her type.

12:19.809 --> 12:21.543
They say opposites attract.

12:21.544 --> 12:23.378
Yeah, I don't know who "they" are,

12:23.379 --> 12:24.913
but, according to Sun Tzu,

12:24.914 --> 12:27.249
you should never fight
an uphill battle.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.284
He had seven wives.

12:29.285 --> 12:33.021
And this is where
the Horseman turned tail?

12:33.022 --> 12:34.923
Yeah.

12:34.924 --> 12:37.025
You said 30 paces west
from your last location?

12:37.026 --> 12:38.360
Precisely.

12:40.630 --> 12:41.798
Okay, we're right below you,

12:41.799 --> 12:43.503
and we've got something
strange on our end.

12:43.504 --> 12:45.434
There's something bolted
to the underside

12:45.435 --> 12:46.768
of the manhole cover,

12:46.769 --> 12:49.375
and it's sitting dead center in a ring

12:49.376 --> 12:51.139
of protective magical glyphs.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.683
That are carved into the tunnel walls.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.844
Yeah, from different ancient cultures.

12:55.845 --> 12:57.446
This is a magical ward.

12:57.447 --> 13:00.415
Powerful enough to repel the Horseman.

13:00.416 --> 13:01.917
Your area of expertise.

13:01.918 --> 13:03.085
All I know is

13:03.086 --> 13:04.820
we have six hours until the sun sets.

13:04.821 --> 13:07.489
Can you remove the disc
and return to the vault?

13:07.490 --> 13:08.924
I can examine it there.

13:09.859 --> 13:11.360
Cake.

13:11.361 --> 13:14.663
It's an electro sonic resonance
redactor of my own design.

13:14.664 --> 13:16.287
It's the same principle
as an ultrasound.

13:16.288 --> 13:17.933
Is it hollow?

13:17.934 --> 13:19.601
Filled with liquid.

13:19.602 --> 13:21.203
Yeah, mercury. Yeah.

13:21.204 --> 13:23.038
Highly prized by ancient peoples.

13:23.039 --> 13:24.873
Chinese emperors drank it.

13:24.874 --> 13:27.042
It's not a good idea, by the by.

13:27.043 --> 13:30.445
I don't think it was mercury
alone that did the trick. Look.

13:31.714 --> 13:33.882
Another ward.

13:33.883 --> 13:35.584
This one is...

13:35.585 --> 13:36.651
Egyptian.

13:36.652 --> 13:37.719
<i>Sa,</i>

13:37.720 --> 13:39.254
used on the tombs of pharaohs.

13:39.255 --> 13:42.157
Wait.

13:42.158 --> 13:43.925
This symbol

13:43.926 --> 13:46.328
and those you discovered
beneath the street.

13:46.329 --> 13:48.497
I've seen this combination before

13:48.498 --> 13:50.399
in the work of a highly
skilled engineer,

13:50.400 --> 13:51.666
surveyor,

13:51.667 --> 13:53.068
and city planner.

13:53.069 --> 13:55.003
His name was Benjamin Banneker.

13:55.004 --> 13:56.905
No way.

13:56.906 --> 13:58.840
No, I've read everything there is

13:58.841 --> 14:00.108
to read on Banneker.

14:00.109 --> 14:02.210
Okay? He was the man.

14:02.211 --> 14:05.013
A true champion of
the Civil Rights Movement

14:05.014 --> 14:07.482
200 years before there
even was a movement.

14:07.483 --> 14:10.318
Banneker was a
revolutionary on many fronts.

14:10.319 --> 14:11.586
I'd once

14:11.587 --> 14:15.223
read an account by a colonial officer,

14:15.224 --> 14:16.892
unnamed,

14:16.893 --> 14:20.929
which described a visit to
Banneker's Maryland workshop

14:20.930 --> 14:22.264
in 1777.

14:22.265 --> 14:24.533
My name is Captain Ichabod Crane.

14:24.534 --> 14:26.701
I'm here on the orders of
General George Washington

14:26.702 --> 14:28.770
to deliver a message
to Benjamin Banneker.

14:28.771 --> 14:31.072
I'm Ben Banneker.

14:31.073 --> 14:33.875
And right now you're
trespassing on my property.

14:33.876 --> 14:35.102
Right, well, I...

14:35.103 --> 14:37.279
According to Maryland law,
it is within my rights

14:37.280 --> 14:38.246
to shoot you dead.

14:38.247 --> 14:41.583
I come in peace, sir.

14:41.584 --> 14:43.318
So...

14:43.319 --> 14:46.087
if you could cut me down.

14:52.295 --> 14:53.995
Now get off my land.

14:53.996 --> 14:55.564
I am to deliver a missive, sir.

14:55.565 --> 14:56.998
Keep it.

14:56.999 --> 15:00.035
Tear it up,
use it to stoke your campfire.

15:00.036 --> 15:02.871
It is an invitation, sir,
from your commander in chief

15:02.872 --> 15:04.415
to join the fight against the British.

15:04.416 --> 15:05.607
I'm not interested.

15:05.608 --> 15:07.142
Mr. Banneker.

15:08.277 --> 15:12.614
You... clearly have skills.

15:12.615 --> 15:15.050
These skills could greatly
benefit the war effort.

15:15.051 --> 15:18.954
And what are your skills, Mr. Crane?

15:18.955 --> 15:21.823
If they told you it was
your ability to persuade,

15:21.824 --> 15:23.325
they were blowing smoke.

15:23.326 --> 15:25.660
I, sir,

15:25.661 --> 15:27.662
could not, in good conscience,

15:27.663 --> 15:29.831
stand idly by while a nation

15:29.832 --> 15:30.855
was oppressed by tyranny.

15:30.856 --> 15:32.334
Yet you gloss over the fact

15:32.335 --> 15:35.670
that those who seek to overthrow

15:35.671 --> 15:38.440
aren't any better than the
masters they seek to expunge.

15:40.243 --> 15:43.845
In a vote between
the lesser of two evils,

15:43.846 --> 15:45.447
I choose not to vote at all.

15:47.383 --> 15:49.384
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

15:49.385 --> 15:52.120
Hold it. How could you
know any of this?

15:53.022 --> 15:54.789
I read it in Banneker's papers.

15:54.790 --> 15:56.693
Well, Benjamin Banneker
is a hero of mine, okay?

15:56.694 --> 15:59.294
I know everything you
can know about the man,

15:59.295 --> 16:00.729
and anyone that knows anything

16:00.730 --> 16:03.298
doesn't know much because

16:03.299 --> 16:05.333
all of Banneker's papers
burned up in a fire

16:05.334 --> 16:06.868
in 1826.

16:09.171 --> 16:11.306
This one was in the
Sleepy Hollow Historical...

16:11.307 --> 16:12.307
No, it wasn't, dude.

16:12.308 --> 16:13.308
Just admit it.

16:13.309 --> 16:14.976
It's okay.

16:14.977 --> 16:16.144
You're a time traveler.

16:16.145 --> 16:17.646
Okay, come on.

16:17.647 --> 16:20.215
He might dress a little
funky, but that's impossible.

16:20.216 --> 16:21.516
Like Headless Horsemen?

16:21.517 --> 16:23.552
Demon John Wilkes Booth?

16:23.553 --> 16:25.387
Jake's right.

16:25.388 --> 16:27.355
I lifted a hair follicle
off your jacket

16:27.356 --> 16:28.790
and sent it to the lab for

16:28.791 --> 16:30.692
carbon-14 dating.

16:30.693 --> 16:32.036
The lack of fluoride, pollutants,

16:32.037 --> 16:33.028
radiation,

16:33.029 --> 16:34.462
iodine, all suggest

16:34.463 --> 16:36.965
you're from a time long before ours.

16:39.135 --> 16:41.803
He is technically 265 years old.

16:41.804 --> 16:43.738
My God!

16:43.739 --> 16:46.541
How come you guys didn't mention this?

16:46.542 --> 16:48.325
One point of proof
does not a QED make.

16:48.326 --> 16:52.280
Besides, really none of our
business when he's from.

16:52.281 --> 16:53.415
Okay, okay, okay.

16:53.416 --> 16:56.251
So, demons, witches...

16:56.252 --> 16:57.252
monsters exist,

16:57.253 --> 16:58.954
and you're a time traveler?

17:01.324 --> 17:03.124
A man out of time.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.325
My God.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.032
Very well.

17:12.034 --> 17:14.868
I was born in 1751.

17:16.238 --> 17:18.839
I was an officer in
General George Washington's.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.840
Colonial Army.

17:19.842 --> 17:21.309
Wait.

17:21.310 --> 17:22.933
This thing that went
after the president,

17:22.934 --> 17:25.614
the red coat, that's not
a fashion statement, is it?

17:25.615 --> 17:27.449
The Horseman and I
have been sworn enemies

17:27.450 --> 17:30.485
since our first meeting
on the battlefield in 1781.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.592
Events transpired that

17:37.593 --> 17:38.693
saw him and me

17:38.694 --> 17:41.463
slumber for...

17:41.464 --> 17:44.265
a little over 200 years.

17:44.266 --> 17:46.768
Until a malevolent demon raised him

17:46.769 --> 17:47.872
as one of the Four Horsemen

17:47.873 --> 17:50.305
of the Apocalypse.

17:50.306 --> 17:53.041
'Twas our great misfortune
to face him many times.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.377
"Our?" You and who?

17:55.378 --> 17:58.680
My partner,

17:58.681 --> 18:00.849
and Miss Jenny's sister,

18:00.850 --> 18:04.085
Lieutenant Grace Abigail Mills.

18:04.086 --> 18:06.955
'Twas our duty as
the two Witnesses to...

18:06.956 --> 18:08.356
You were witnesses?

18:08.357 --> 18:10.759
You just said the Four Horsemen.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.461
So, like, the two Biblical Witnesses?

18:13.462 --> 18:14.696
The very same.

18:15.798 --> 18:17.298
And we did it.

18:17.299 --> 18:18.967
Together,

18:18.968 --> 18:21.403
we stopped the Horseman's master

18:21.404 --> 18:23.738
from unleashing the armies of hell.

18:25.641 --> 18:28.476
You had me at "A man out of time."

18:28.477 --> 18:30.545
Crane?

18:30.546 --> 18:33.681
You and me, outside, now.

18:44.236 --> 18:45.384
You saved my life

18:45.385 --> 18:46.619
so I cut you some slack.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.955
Ever since then,
you're the only person who has

18:48.956 --> 18:50.269
any information on these bizarre

18:50.270 --> 18:51.704
supernatural occurrences
popping up in my cases.

18:51.705 --> 18:53.793
- Agent Thomas...
- Now I find out that you

18:53.794 --> 18:55.428
are the supernatural?

18:55.429 --> 18:57.864
Do you think it's okay
to keep that from us?

18:57.865 --> 19:00.300
- Your anger is warranted.
- Yeah.

19:00.301 --> 19:01.901
But...

19:01.902 --> 19:04.270
there was much to which
I was asking you to adjust.

19:04.271 --> 19:05.672
I'm DHS and a Marine.

19:05.673 --> 19:07.907
I think I can handle
whatever you throw at me.

19:07.908 --> 19:10.043
Very well.

19:10.044 --> 19:11.177
Point taken.

19:11.178 --> 19:14.347
But in a matter of
hours the sun will set

19:14.348 --> 19:15.451
and the Horseman will ride.

19:15.452 --> 19:17.684
Finish your story.
Tell us what we need to know.

19:17.685 --> 19:20.720
But do us the courtesy
of being straight with us.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.293
We good?

19:27.294 --> 19:28.928
- No.
- Yes.

19:28.929 --> 19:30.797
But we're burning daylight.

19:30.798 --> 19:33.366
You knew Banneker?

19:33.367 --> 19:34.434
No.

19:34.435 --> 19:36.269
<i>He knew Banneker.</i>

19:36.270 --> 19:37.837
Knew him personally.

19:37.838 --> 19:40.173
Well...

19:40.174 --> 19:42.008
enough to know he
would've greatly appreciated

19:42.009 --> 19:43.843
your admiration, Master Wells.

19:43.844 --> 19:45.011
This metal disc,

19:45.012 --> 19:46.346
how is it connected to him?

19:46.347 --> 19:48.748
Washington ordered me
to deliver a missive.

19:48.749 --> 19:51.184
When Banneker refused it, I
followed him into his workshop.

19:51.185 --> 19:53.353
<i>What I beheld inside</i>

19:53.354 --> 19:55.588
<i>was a chamber of wonders.</i>

19:55.589 --> 19:58.091
These plans are...

19:58.092 --> 20:00.460
magnificent.

20:03.697 --> 20:06.966
Do I see signs of the Hermetic code?

20:08.969 --> 20:10.370
An apostle of the square,

20:10.371 --> 20:12.539
level and plumb, are we?

20:12.540 --> 20:14.541
I am a Freemason, yes.

20:18.546 --> 20:20.446
This city.

20:22.483 --> 20:26.052
This does not exist, does it?

20:26.053 --> 20:27.420
Not yet.

20:27.421 --> 20:29.255
No.

20:29.256 --> 20:31.024
But it will.

20:32.827 --> 20:36.930
A metropolis dedicated
to the noble and true,

20:36.931 --> 20:40.266
with liberty and justice for all men,

20:40.267 --> 20:43.136
regardless of their race,
color or creed,

20:43.137 --> 20:46.306
incorporating the sublime aspects

20:46.307 --> 20:48.641
of Persian and Aramaic architecture,

20:48.642 --> 20:50.944
Mayan and Egyptian,

20:50.945 --> 20:52.545
Sumerian.

20:52.546 --> 20:53.546
This city,

20:53.547 --> 20:55.448
this must sit at the heart

20:55.449 --> 20:57.417
of our new nation.

20:57.418 --> 20:59.719
A beacon.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.188
A bright, shining jewel.

21:06.527 --> 21:08.861
A tarnished one, perhaps.

21:09.997 --> 21:12.765
Your so-called founders,

21:12.766 --> 21:14.868
Washington, Jefferson, Franklin,

21:14.869 --> 21:16.736
they speak of freedom,

21:16.737 --> 21:20.139
yet they allow the abhorrent
practice of slavery to continue.

21:20.140 --> 21:21.708
They ignore the relevance

21:21.709 --> 21:25.278
of an entire segment
of the American population.

21:25.279 --> 21:30.049
I am an abolitionist, Mr. Banneker.

21:30.050 --> 21:31.818
I agree.

21:31.819 --> 21:34.487
All men, regardless of race,

21:34.488 --> 21:35.788
creed or color,

21:35.789 --> 21:39.392
deserve to be free.

21:39.393 --> 21:43.529
Revolution can only begin on the page.

21:45.432 --> 21:48.768
The final act must be
played on the streets...

21:48.769 --> 21:51.971
to the resounding beat
of righteous hearts.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.841
I know these men.

21:54.842 --> 21:57.410
Speak.

21:57.411 --> 21:59.512
They will hear you.

22:01.982 --> 22:04.951
In my correspondence with Washington,

22:04.952 --> 22:06.586
I have said as much.

22:09.156 --> 22:12.825
Perhaps... um,
there's a different approach.

22:12.826 --> 22:16.596
This issue, if not dealt with,

22:16.597 --> 22:18.865
will tear this new union apart.

22:20.668 --> 22:22.702
Good day to you, Mr. Crane.

22:22.703 --> 22:24.637
This was surprisingly pleasurable.

22:29.543 --> 22:32.311
Safe journeys from whence you came.

22:40.521 --> 22:42.388
So, if this ward

22:42.389 --> 22:46.459
was built by Banneker and it is
able to deter the Horseman,

22:46.460 --> 22:48.861
what else was in his arsenal?

22:48.862 --> 22:50.063
See, right there?

22:50.064 --> 22:52.332
Problem is, what I told
you before is true.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.868
All of Banneker's papers burned
up in a fire 150 years ago.

22:55.869 --> 22:58.037
Maybe not all.

22:58.038 --> 23:00.673
You say there was a folio
with the symbol of Sa

23:00.674 --> 23:02.508
- in Banneker's workshop?
- Indeed.

23:02.509 --> 23:03.810
Joe and I busted into this

23:03.811 --> 23:05.545
black market artifact
auction a while back.

23:05.546 --> 23:06.946
I saw a leather folio

23:06.947 --> 23:08.381
with that symbol on the side.

23:08.382 --> 23:09.549
May I?

23:09.550 --> 23:11.651
Yeah.

23:18.892 --> 23:20.293
Here.

23:21.061 --> 23:22.462
Architectural drawings

23:22.463 --> 23:23.886
from the collection of B. Banneker.

23:23.887 --> 23:25.965
Wait. How is this even possible?

23:25.966 --> 23:27.759
Dude, I've searched
everywhere for any trace

23:27.760 --> 23:29.966
that any of Banneker's work
might've survived that fire.

23:29.967 --> 23:31.991
Yeah, I've been working
these black market channels

23:31.992 --> 23:33.606
for a long time, and the good news is,

23:33.607 --> 23:35.608
the buyer lives here in D.C.

23:35.609 --> 23:38.778
The folio sold for a small fortune

23:38.779 --> 23:41.180
to tech billionaire Malcolm Dreyfuss.

23:44.218 --> 23:47.120
<i>Mr. Dreyfuss, a word.</i>

23:47.121 --> 23:49.455
A Department of
Homeland Security officer

23:49.456 --> 23:52.125
is here to see you, and she
has Ichabod Crane in tow.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.527
They're on their way up right now.

23:54.528 --> 23:56.629
All right.

23:56.630 --> 23:58.531
Well, let's just let it play out,

23:58.532 --> 24:01.601
and if it seems like they have
any clue about what we're up to,

24:01.602 --> 24:03.002
talismans, et cetera,

24:03.003 --> 24:07.373
then I may need you
to improvise, my friend.

24:09.009 --> 24:10.872
They said it was a matter
of national security,

24:10.873 --> 24:12.278
Mr. Dreyfuss.

24:12.279 --> 24:15.081
Agent Diana Thomas,
Department of Homeland Security.

24:15.082 --> 24:17.450
Okay.

24:17.451 --> 24:20.753
Will you tell me, is this
about the insider trading

24:20.754 --> 24:24.624
or the offshore accounts maybe,

24:24.625 --> 24:28.961
or did you finally find
the ditch where all the...

24:28.962 --> 24:30.563
the bodies are buried?

24:38.075 --> 24:40.318
So, please tell me, how may I

24:40.319 --> 24:42.487
be of service to the mighty DHS?

24:42.488 --> 24:44.989
I'm investigating a pressing case.

24:44.990 --> 24:48.326
Does this have something
to do with the president?

24:48.327 --> 24:49.828
I hear people are

24:49.829 --> 24:52.030
absolutely losing their heads

24:52.031 --> 24:54.265
over last night's attack.

24:54.266 --> 24:56.601
Our work is classified.

24:56.602 --> 24:58.236
What I can tell you
is that we're looking

24:58.237 --> 25:01.339
for a specific item that we
think may be in your possession.

25:01.340 --> 25:04.842
It's a leather folio once
owned by Benjamin Banneker.

25:08.013 --> 25:12.984
I... I do have a rare Banneker folio.

25:12.985 --> 25:15.987
It's in the vault downstairs.

25:15.988 --> 25:17.608
Would you be a dear and go fetch that?

25:22.194 --> 25:24.028
What made you first pick up the item?

25:24.029 --> 25:27.232
I guess I am a freak for the freaky.

25:27.233 --> 25:30.068
I've always been intrigued
by the concept of the occult,

25:30.069 --> 25:32.136
and this is definitely the town for it.

25:32.137 --> 25:36.341
Washington D.C...
has quite a reputation

25:36.342 --> 25:39.544
as a hotbed for alleged
supernatural activity.

25:39.545 --> 25:43.615
Ghosts, goblins, demons, witches...

25:43.616 --> 25:45.383
even the odd leprechaun.

25:45.384 --> 25:47.452
Yes. Every city has its share of lore

25:47.453 --> 25:49.387
and its admirers.

25:49.388 --> 25:53.491
Perhaps your considerable
success, like Banneker's,

25:53.492 --> 25:55.727
relies on the preternatural.

25:57.296 --> 26:01.766
I don't, um, I don't need
Banneker's folio for that.

26:02.701 --> 26:05.803
I sold my soul...

26:05.804 --> 26:07.839
to the devil

26:07.840 --> 26:09.640
at age 25.

26:14.914 --> 26:16.458
Sorry. I kid, of course.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.045
It's one thing to read comic books.

26:19.046 --> 26:20.418
It's entirely another to believe

26:20.419 --> 26:21.886
a man can fly.

26:21.887 --> 26:23.041
By the way you speak of him,

26:23.042 --> 26:24.509
sounds like Banneker was the latter.

26:24.510 --> 26:27.558
Yes. Banneker,
he definitely believed

26:27.559 --> 26:29.427
in powers and forces way

26:29.428 --> 26:30.762
beyond our ken,

26:30.763 --> 26:33.498
a credence reflected in his folio.

26:41.941 --> 26:45.777
Banneker's
plans for a golden city

26:45.778 --> 26:47.979
were said to have been
used by Pierre L'Enfant

26:47.980 --> 26:50.615
as a template for Washington D.C.

26:50.616 --> 26:52.483
Banneker envisioned

26:52.484 --> 26:54.285
the impossible

26:54.286 --> 26:56.521
laid over the possible.

26:59.758 --> 27:01.359
Take J Street, for example.

27:02.394 --> 27:04.963
There is no J Street in D.C.

27:04.964 --> 27:07.031
It was skipped because the letter "J"

27:07.032 --> 27:08.615
was interchangeable with the letter "I"

27:08.616 --> 27:10.301
in Colonial times.

27:10.302 --> 27:11.636
Yes. However,

27:11.637 --> 27:14.038
there are those in the occult community

27:14.039 --> 27:17.442
who claim that J Street
actually exists.

27:17.443 --> 27:19.978
In fact, some even say

27:19.979 --> 27:21.980
that J Street was meant to be a trap

27:21.981 --> 27:26.484
for any supernatural threat
to the seat of government.

27:26.485 --> 27:27.785
Well.

27:27.786 --> 27:31.656
Your knowledge of the
supernatural certainly is...

27:31.657 --> 27:32.991
extensive.

27:32.992 --> 27:34.826
Mr. Dreyfuss,

27:34.827 --> 27:37.762
the board was expecting
you a half hour ago.

27:40.332 --> 27:42.033
You're free to borrow this.

27:42.034 --> 27:44.836
If that's all you need from me...

27:44.837 --> 27:47.171
Thank you for your cooperation.

27:47.172 --> 27:49.574
Thank you. Thank you.

27:51.176 --> 27:54.145
Quite the supernatural
hobbyist, is he not?

27:54.146 --> 27:55.689
That's a tactic a lot of people

27:55.690 --> 27:57.281
at the top of the pyramid use.

27:57.282 --> 28:00.651
Play the odd bird,
hide your true intentions.

28:00.652 --> 28:03.621
Regardless of his motive,
if the information

28:03.622 --> 28:05.990
he gave on J Street is correct,

28:05.991 --> 28:10.361
it may be exactly what we
need to stop the Horseman.

28:10.362 --> 28:12.830
I think we both know I don't have

28:12.831 --> 28:16.167
a board meeting today
because, that's right,

28:16.168 --> 28:18.169
I don't have a board.

28:18.170 --> 28:21.205
What are you playing at, Malcolm?

28:21.206 --> 28:23.808
Why give them Banneker's map?
Why tell them about J Street?

28:23.809 --> 28:27.011
I'm delegating, my friend.

28:27.012 --> 28:29.080
No one knows the Dark
Rider better than Crane,

28:29.081 --> 28:32.083
and if he can use J Street
to trap the Horseman,

28:32.084 --> 28:36.220
then we will be able to bargain
from a position of strength.

28:36.221 --> 28:37.889
Crane is your enemy.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.991
Why trust him with a
job this important?

28:39.992 --> 28:41.659
A beta test.

28:41.660 --> 28:45.430
No one has been to J
Street in hundreds of years.

28:45.431 --> 28:47.498
It's your call, but for the record,

28:47.499 --> 28:50.068
I advise against it.

28:50.069 --> 28:53.037
Noted and appreciated.

28:53.038 --> 28:55.473
Banneker's golden
city is practically

28:55.474 --> 28:58.676
one-to-one to the actual layout of D.C.

28:58.677 --> 29:01.145
So, Banneker went and worked
with the founders after all?

29:01.146 --> 29:03.381
Story for another day.
We do not have long to prepare.

29:03.382 --> 29:04.582
You're thinking J Street.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.884
It is a cul-de-sac,

29:06.885 --> 29:09.587
so if we lure the Horseman in,

29:09.588 --> 29:12.256
we can use Banneker's
disc to block his way out.

29:12.257 --> 29:15.393
But you said that it's enchanted,

29:15.394 --> 29:16.561
so how do we open it?

29:16.562 --> 29:18.163
There-There might
be some reference

29:18.164 --> 29:19.147
in the secret histories.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.822
Very good. With me.

29:33.112 --> 29:35.446
Wow. You came loaded for bear.

29:35.447 --> 29:39.283
Yeah, well, none of this'll
stop the Horseman,

29:39.284 --> 29:41.519
but might slow him down.

29:43.589 --> 29:45.490
I understand Crane's connection

29:45.491 --> 29:48.126
to him and all of this, but...

29:48.127 --> 29:50.094
you got pulled in
because of your sister?

29:50.095 --> 29:51.596
Yeah. I was with her

29:51.597 --> 29:54.532
when the whole Witness
thing started for her.

29:56.635 --> 29:59.770
I was 12. She was 13.

30:01.173 --> 30:03.174
We took a shortcut home from school

30:03.175 --> 30:05.977
and came upon a demon raising a warlock

30:05.978 --> 30:09.747
in front of these four white trees.

30:13.385 --> 30:15.486
Four white trees.

30:15.487 --> 30:16.687
Here.

30:16.688 --> 30:20.291
An entry that purports
the way to J Street.

30:21.860 --> 30:22.994
Right.

30:22.995 --> 30:23.931
If you could learn

30:23.932 --> 30:25.596
where the president
is being kept tonight,

30:25.597 --> 30:27.589
then we can intercept
the Horseman en route.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.867
I can try, but what's your
plan to lure the Horseman?

30:29.868 --> 30:33.237
Much as he would like
the president's head,

30:33.238 --> 30:35.206
I think he'd leap
at the chance for mine.

30:35.207 --> 30:38.209
Okay, well, I will stop in my
office and see what I can find,

30:38.210 --> 30:40.111
and I will meet you
between I and K streets.

30:40.112 --> 30:42.413
Soon to be J.

30:42.414 --> 30:44.351
<i>Hey, Clara.</i>

30:44.352 --> 30:45.844
Yeah, so, you're picking up Molly

30:45.845 --> 30:47.576
from soccer practice
this afternoon, right?

30:47.577 --> 30:49.253
Great. You're a lifesaver.

30:49.254 --> 30:52.023
See you soon. Bye.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.681
This is impossible.

32:18.455 --> 32:21.757
DHS has sent out a fleet
of decoy motorcades.

32:21.758 --> 32:24.160
Air Force One is already
in the air, but POTUS

32:24.161 --> 32:27.029
is staying locked up tight,
safe in the White House.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.198
Very good. Then the
Horseman will have to venture

32:29.199 --> 32:30.666
down Pennsylvania Avenue

32:30.667 --> 32:32.835
to reach his target.
Any other direction,

32:32.836 --> 32:35.771
he'll have his route blocked
by one of Banneker's wards.

32:35.772 --> 32:37.373
I shall intercept him. Lure him here.

32:37.374 --> 32:39.141
How are we gonna get
this entrance open?

32:39.142 --> 32:40.943
The others are negotiating it.

32:43.113 --> 32:45.348
The workings of this entrance

32:45.349 --> 32:47.683
are hidden in the
tunnels beneath our feet.

32:47.684 --> 32:49.218
Come.

32:49.219 --> 32:51.520
<i>Now, according
to comparison charts</i>

32:51.521 --> 32:53.489
between Banneker's map and,

32:53.490 --> 32:56.625
what I've been able to chart of
this tunnel system, we're close.

32:56.626 --> 32:59.495
I don't see any handles,
locks, levers, buttons,

32:59.496 --> 33:01.097
counterweights, nothing.

33:01.098 --> 33:03.132
The secret histories are
fairly straightforward

33:03.133 --> 33:04.533
on how to get to J Street.

33:04.534 --> 33:06.135
Those who can speak the words

33:06.136 --> 33:07.870
may open the way.

33:07.871 --> 33:10.873
I don't see any words,
but I do see more glyphs.

33:10.874 --> 33:12.975
Well, that's your jam. No?

33:12.976 --> 33:14.143
Yeah.

33:14.144 --> 33:15.611
<i>Molly drew this.</i>

33:18.348 --> 33:21.051
She is quite the gifted artist.

33:21.052 --> 33:23.886
And meticulous.
She dates all of her notebooks.

33:23.887 --> 33:27.423
She drew this weeks
before she ever met you.

33:28.725 --> 33:30.426
How is that even possible?

33:30.427 --> 33:33.729
I want the unvarnished truth this time.

33:33.730 --> 33:36.098
Very well.

33:37.267 --> 33:38.567
This picture...

33:38.568 --> 33:41.604
this is when Abbie and I first met.

33:41.605 --> 33:44.707
This was when the
Horseman slew her mentor.

33:44.708 --> 33:46.876
And this...

33:46.877 --> 33:49.912
this was her first brush
with the supernatural.

33:49.913 --> 33:52.348
Abbie, your partner. The one that died.

33:52.349 --> 33:53.516
Yeah.

33:53.517 --> 33:55.551
It's as if these were drawn

33:55.552 --> 33:57.219
from her perspective.

33:57.220 --> 34:00.556
She was a-a...
what do you call it... a Witness.

34:00.557 --> 34:01.891
Like you, right?

34:01.892 --> 34:03.893
A mantle,

34:03.894 --> 34:06.795
which Miss Jenny and I believe
has passed on to another.

34:08.063 --> 34:09.364
Molly.

34:09.366 --> 34:10.433
If you'll allow me to...

34:10.434 --> 34:11.976
I don't... You, what do you think,

34:11.978 --> 34:13.569
she just inherited this Witness?

34:13.570 --> 34:15.237
Agent Thomas...

34:30.786 --> 34:32.621
The Horseman...

34:32.621 --> 34:35.324
has a head.

34:36.592 --> 34:37.993
Tell the others to open the way.

34:37.994 --> 34:41.697
- Okay.
- I'll bring him to you.

34:43.467 --> 34:45.333
The doorway. Open it now!

34:45.335 --> 34:46.969
Let's hope this works.

34:46.969 --> 34:49.472
<i>Hoy. Duir.</i>

34:49.473 --> 34:51.106
<i>Sa.</i>

34:51.107 --> 34:52.174
<i>Raido.</i>

34:54.878 --> 34:56.844
We need this thing open. Now!

34:59.583 --> 35:02.618
Are you so eager for
the president's head

35:02.619 --> 35:06.188
that you would turn
down this opportunity?

35:07.791 --> 35:09.458
You've waited a long time for this.

35:09.459 --> 35:11.193
Look, it's right here.

35:12.629 --> 35:14.463
I knew we should've done a test run.

35:14.464 --> 35:16.247
No! No! The secret histories
were very clear.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.766
Those who can speak the words

35:17.767 --> 35:18.934
may open the way.

35:18.935 --> 35:21.971
"Speak," as in translate
four different languages

35:21.972 --> 35:24.373
into one.

35:25.442 --> 35:27.309
The one we speak.

35:27.310 --> 35:28.978
Try this.

35:28.979 --> 35:30.679
<i>Hoy.</i>

35:30.680 --> 35:31.847
Make sacred.

35:35.018 --> 35:36.018
<i>Sa.</i>

35:36.019 --> 35:37.186
Perhaps you're afraid.

35:37.187 --> 35:39.188
Now you have a chin,

35:39.189 --> 35:41.323
I might take a swing at it.

35:41.324 --> 35:42.558
That's right...

35:47.531 --> 35:50.566
<i>Sa. Protect from evil.</i>

35:52.736 --> 35:54.103
<i>Duir.</i>

35:54.104 --> 35:56.272
Unlock the way.

35:56.273 --> 35:57.973
<i>Raido.</i>

35:57.974 --> 35:59.408
For our journey.

36:01.177 --> 36:03.012
Whoa.

36:04.948 --> 36:07.182
Come on.

36:09.886 --> 36:13.922
Come on! Come on, let's go. Let's go.

36:15.058 --> 36:17.026
Guess you know your runes.

36:17.027 --> 36:18.527
Alex. Phase two.

36:18.528 --> 36:20.462
You're on deck.

36:24.334 --> 36:27.002
What was that?

36:27.003 --> 36:28.704
I don't know,.

36:28.705 --> 36:31.473
Something is off.

36:37.881 --> 36:40.449
Go back the way we came. Now!

36:43.253 --> 36:44.687
Hello, old chum.

36:47.223 --> 36:48.857
Aah!

37:03.340 --> 37:05.040
Come on, come on. Let's do this!

37:05.041 --> 37:06.408
Almost there.

37:06.409 --> 37:07.976
Where are they?

37:13.183 --> 37:14.983
Aah!

37:18.455 --> 37:19.888
Go!

37:19.889 --> 37:21.490
Go! Go!

37:24.928 --> 37:26.295
All right, we're good.

37:26.296 --> 37:28.163
Go! Now!

37:32.802 --> 37:35.437
Close the door!

37:36.606 --> 37:39.575
Well. Roaches check in,

37:39.576 --> 37:42.444
end up buying a time share.

37:48.284 --> 37:50.352
Capital work.

37:52.055 --> 37:54.390
For a group so new to this war,

37:54.391 --> 37:56.725
we have fought
exceptionally well this night.

37:56.726 --> 38:00.729
This is truly a milestone
in the war against evil.

38:00.730 --> 38:02.231
None of this changes the fact

38:02.232 --> 38:04.733
that you kept crucial
information from me.

38:04.734 --> 38:06.702
About who you are, where you're from,

38:06.703 --> 38:10.305
when you're from,
and about my daughter.

38:10.306 --> 38:12.775
And that you think there is a
world in which I'm gonna let you

38:12.776 --> 38:15.077
take her anywhere near any of this.

38:15.078 --> 38:18.614
I assure you upon my honor,
every one of us will be with you

38:18.615 --> 38:20.816
for every step of this journey,

38:20.817 --> 38:23.952
and Molly's safety
is absolute paramount.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.320
Yeah. Which is why

38:25.321 --> 38:27.990
none of you are coming
anywhere near her.

38:27.991 --> 38:30.659
I understand this is
difficult to take in...

38:30.660 --> 38:33.295
Stop. This ends here and now.

38:33.296 --> 38:37.166
No more supernatural
creatures. No more Vault.

38:37.167 --> 38:39.401
No more you.

38:40.837 --> 38:42.037
Agent Thomas.

38:44.040 --> 38:47.109
You cannot escape this.

38:47.110 --> 38:49.645
Yeah?

38:49.646 --> 38:51.246
Watch me.

38:54.584 --> 38:56.636
Okay, Molly. I am going
to ask you some questions

38:56.637 --> 39:00.325
and I want you to answer them as
truthfully and as best you can.

39:02.128 --> 39:04.729
You draw from life.
Where'd you see these things?

39:06.098 --> 39:08.300
I don't know.

39:08.301 --> 39:10.602
I didn't actually see them.

39:10.603 --> 39:14.806
It was like they came to me in a dream.

39:14.807 --> 39:16.941
Are you still having these dreams?

39:16.942 --> 39:19.010
No, Mom.

39:19.011 --> 39:21.913
Not since I stopped being quiet.

39:23.115 --> 39:24.683
Did I do something wrong?

39:24.684 --> 39:26.651
No. Absolutely not. Okay?

39:26.652 --> 39:28.820
And we are gonna go back
to the way things were

39:28.821 --> 39:30.522
before any of this.

39:30.523 --> 39:32.891
I promise you.

39:32.892 --> 39:36.060
Sweet girl, promise.

39:41.834 --> 39:43.935
Mind if we join you?

39:44.870 --> 39:46.204
Whoa..

39:46.205 --> 39:47.439
Easy. Easy...

39:49.208 --> 39:51.042
I come in peace.

39:51.043 --> 39:54.546
My understanding is you
want the president's head.

39:54.547 --> 39:58.483
As it happens, I can
work that out for you.

40:01.587 --> 40:04.723
Man of few words. I like that.

40:04.724 --> 40:06.424
I can get you out of here,

40:06.425 --> 40:10.261
and I can get you near
the commander in chief.

40:10.262 --> 40:14.632
In fact, I will even give you
that thorn in your side,

40:14.633 --> 40:17.702
one Ichabod Crane.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.440
I'll take that as a yes.

40:22.441 --> 40:24.242
I've removed Banneker's disc.

40:24.243 --> 40:26.611
The way is clear.

40:26.612 --> 40:28.012
Excellent, Jobe.

40:29.615 --> 40:34.219
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

40:49.735 --> 40:52.404
My strength is replenished,

40:52.405 --> 40:57.175
and I am ready for battle once more.

40:58.878 --> 41:01.446
So...

41:01.447 --> 41:06.117
whether ye be "Skurar" or "Malm" or...

41:06.118 --> 41:08.453
"Hemnes,"

41:08.454 --> 41:11.322
I shall show your Swedish cohorts

41:11.323 --> 41:15.593
that I am the master of this domain.

41:16.695 --> 41:18.129
Four...

41:21.667 --> 41:24.002
Which is the big one?

41:24.003 --> 41:26.004
There's a big one and a small one.

41:30.009 --> 41:32.444
Well, the... this is...

41:32.445 --> 41:34.646
It's a...

41:34.647 --> 41:36.648
There's a big one and a small...

41:51.697 --> 41:54.265
Creaking floorboard.

41:54.266 --> 41:57.468
Add it to the long list of repairs.

41:59.505 --> 42:01.606
Home, sweet, home.
