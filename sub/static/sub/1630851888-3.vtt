But not for long because
I was looking at his smile

She is doting on her dog,
baxter.

05:33.408 --> 05:34.791

He can appear to be

He just has to warm up to you.

06:24.033 --> 06:26.793
He enjoys the finer things

A short amount of time

13:22.118 --> 13:23.359
You know, I graduated college,

13:23.378 --> 13:25.119
I got accepted
to a master's program,

13:25.138 --> 13:28.122
I had an incredible job,
bought and paid for two homes.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.975
I pretty much have everything
but a wife.

13:31.052 --> 13:32.368
This is why I took
that leap of faith

13:32.387 --> 13:33.770
Of being married
at first sight.

13:35.707 --> 13:37.649

- It's going to be good, man,
it's going to be good.

13:44.399 --> 13:46.491
- Once the wheels start
rolling, you ain't going back.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.384
- That's right,
like a roller coaster, right,

13:48.403 --> 13:50.570
It's exciting when you get in
line and then it's like okay,

13:50.722 --> 13:51.888
A little, little bit and you
get closer and you start

13:51.890 --> 13:54.165
Getting a little bit nervous.

13:54.317 --> 13:55.667
And then they say, okay,

13:55.743 --> 13:57.001
And you sit in there
and you buckle up

13:57.153 --> 13:58.503
And then that's it,
there ain't no going back.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.338
- You act like you're getting
married or something.

14:00.489 --> 14:02.507
- I know, right, silly me.

14:04.419 --> 14:07.086
- So here's the dress.
- Oh...

14:07.238 --> 14:09.739
- I love it so much,
I can't wait to wear it.

14:09.741 --> 14:12.517
Everyone is gonna see it.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.594

out of life.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.917
While rachel has struggled
to find her voice

14:20.919 --> 14:22.694
In relationships in the past,

14:22.770 --> 14:25.938
We believe that someone
like jose who shares her level

14:26.091 --> 14:28.533
Of commitment can give her
the security she needs

14:28.684 --> 14:31.018
To thrive as a wife.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.779
And for jose, rachel's
down-to-earth spirit

14:33.932 --> 14:38.192
Can help even out his often
overly structured nature.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.286
- Your body's going to look
amazing in that dress.

14:40.438 --> 14:43.047
- We got the girls
showing today.

14:43.199 --> 14:44.698

14:44.718 --> 14:47.126
And I'm just so excited
to see my husband.

14:47.278 --> 14:51.222
I'm just ready to be a wife
and I feel prepared

14:51.374 --> 14:54.208
Because even though
my last relationship ended

14:54.227 --> 14:55.727
Six months ago.

14:55.803 --> 14:59.972
I gave him my everything
and he was unfaithful.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.959
As much as that crushed me,
it did make me realize

15:02.977 --> 15:08.981

with someone in a marriage.

15:46.095 --> 15:48.429
Like, I can't have

15:48.448 --> 15:52.842
You know, like...I don't know,
if he doesn't talk back.

15:52.860 --> 15:56.195
Before a word is uttered, the
first thing we're going to see

15:56.347 --> 15:59.682
Is, oh, they're good looking,
or he might not be

15:59.701 --> 16:03.294
Because he has
an amazing personality

16:03.371 --> 16:05.797
And that's really
what I'm hoping for

16:05.948 --> 16:08.967
Because I love talking, but I'm
an even better listener,

16:09.118 --> 16:10.693
I think, so...

16:10.712 --> 16:12.712
- But you're easy to bring up
conversations,

16:12.864 --> 16:14.472
You're probably
going to have to.

16:14.549 --> 16:16.382
- Yeah, but I don't want to do
all the work.

16:16.534 --> 16:17.958
- Yeah.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.794

16:20.814 --> 16:23.723

I guess, pressure

16:23.875 --> 16:26.317
Or just patient more right now?

16:26.394 --> 16:27.986
- The pressure's yeah,
it's definitely there

16:28.137 --> 16:32.323
Because what goes along
with this expectation,

16:32.475 --> 16:36.068
Is she gonna be--
am I gonna be what she wants,

16:36.221 --> 16:39.572
So there's two sides
of the coin there, so...

16:39.724 --> 16:41.482
There's an element of fear.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.742
It's super scary
and it's about to

16:42.818 --> 16:45.061
Become super real
in the next couple of hours.

16:45.079 --> 16:47.321
So the risk right now is me
not knowing who she is,

16:47.340 --> 16:50.916
Who she could be, who
the experts match me up with.

16:51.069 --> 16:54.070
There's some insecurities there
for me, you know,

16:54.088 --> 16:55.346
I'm less than six foot.

16:55.498 --> 16:58.516
I do think I have a larger nose
and a little bit

16:58.593 --> 17:01.744
Bigger forehead, straight up,
and I just want her to be

17:01.763 --> 17:04.522

17:04.673 --> 17:06.858
Yeah, man, yeah.

this marriage work,

17:09.195 --> 17:12.271

those mini opinions

17:12.423 --> 17:17.684

20:33.566 --> 20:35.900
It's happening.

20:35.977 --> 20:39.886
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

20:39.906 --> 20:42.907
My last relationship
crushed a part of me.

20:43.058 --> 20:47.060
And honestly, I am worried
that if this doesn't work out,

20:47.080 --> 20:49.989
This might be another blow

20:50.141 --> 20:54.418
Where I just kind of go back
to the less confident rachel

20:54.495 --> 20:56.087
Who's just a total doormat.

20:58.816 --> 20:59.882
- Please stand.

21:03.337 --> 21:06.264
- I don't know that I'll be
able to tell right off the bat

21:06.340 --> 21:07.840
That she is attracted to me.

21:07.992 --> 21:09.934
I hope there's little things
that I can latch onto

21:10.085 --> 21:13.012
And kind of take notice of,
but I don't know that.

22:04.565 --> 22:06.324
Hi. [laughing]

22:08.553 --> 22:10.328
- Is it my turn?

22:10.404 --> 22:12.054
- Shall I introduce myself?

22:12.056 --> 22:13.497
I'm rachel. [laughing]

22:13.649 --> 22:14.890
- I'm jose, nice to meet you.

22:14.892 --> 22:17.409
- Hi. Say your name again?
- Jose.

22:17.562 --> 22:18.836
- Jose.
- Nice to meet you.

22:18.913 --> 22:20.396
- Nice to meet you too.
- You look so gorgeous.

22:20.414 --> 22:21.172
- Thank you, thank you.

22:24.919 --> 22:28.904
So we got the first step.
- That's right!

22:28.906 --> 22:32.074
- Are we good with that?

22:32.093 --> 22:34.018
- That's my wife,
that's my wife.

22:36.338 --> 22:37.930
- "my wife."

22:38.082 --> 22:40.173
- So, jose,

22:40.193 --> 22:43.085
Rachel's friends and family
would like for you to know

22:43.087 --> 22:45.270
A couple of things about her.

22:45.423 --> 22:50.868
Rachel has the gift of sleep,
and I mean a deep sleep.

22:51.019 --> 22:53.445
She sets 20 alarms
just to make sure

22:53.598 --> 22:55.280
She wakes up in the morning.

22:55.433 --> 22:56.932
- I'm okay with that.

22:56.934 --> 23:00.378
- Rachel must be fed
at all times.

23:00.454 --> 23:03.105
"hangry" rachel is someone

23:03.124 --> 23:06.217
That only the brave
can survive.

23:06.293 --> 23:08.052
Are you ready for that
challenge?

23:08.129 --> 23:09.369
- Well, luckily, I cook,
so we'll be fine.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.389
- Yay!

23:11.540 --> 23:12.706
- And lastly,

23:12.725 --> 23:16.894
Rachel is fiercely loyal
to those she loves.

23:17.045 --> 23:21.399
And as times go by, it's our
deepest wish that that love

23:21.475 --> 23:24.960
Develops between you both
and you are able to experience

23:24.962 --> 23:29.148
That love from her firsthand.

23:29.300 --> 23:32.243
So, rachel, jose's family and
friends would like you to know

23:32.394 --> 23:37.139
That jose has been preparing
for you for a long time.

23:37.158 --> 23:39.417
He is detailed, creative,

23:39.568 --> 23:43.479
And very, very structured.

23:43.497 --> 23:46.590
Emphasis on structured.
- Okay.

23:49.077 --> 23:51.762
- Jose is a risk taker,
which is why he's here,

23:51.839 --> 23:53.597
Marrying you today.

23:53.749 --> 23:56.934
Jose has a big heart and will
do everything in his power

23:57.085 --> 23:59.178
To make you happy.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.422
Welcome to the family.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.275
- Ooh.

24:04.426 --> 24:05.568
- I like that.
[laughing and applause]

24:08.673 --> 24:12.174
- Jose and rachel, you have
written your own vows,

24:12.176 --> 24:15.619
So please share those
with us now.

24:15.696 --> 24:18.605
- Rachel, I'm so happy
and extremely excited

24:18.624 --> 24:22.184
To have met someone as
committed and as crazy as I am.

24:22.203 --> 24:23.869
We're strangers.
- Yeah.

24:24.021 --> 24:25.796
- But I hope that one day we
can look back and think, wow,

24:25.948 --> 24:28.299
This was the best decision
we ever made.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.450
I've sacrificed and built
so much independently up to

24:30.470 --> 24:33.696
This point, knowing that
one day, today, I would be able

24:33.714 --> 24:36.381
To provide for a queen,
yourself.

24:36.534 --> 24:39.310
So I promise to be that man I
think you always sought after,

24:39.386 --> 24:42.037
That supporter, that provider,
um, not only financially,

24:42.039 --> 24:43.539
But emotionally, spiritually,

24:43.541 --> 24:46.391
Independently, and sexually.
[coughs]

24:46.544 --> 24:48.152
- [laughing]

24:53.493 --> 24:55.826
- But last and not least, you
have my 110 percent commitment

24:55.903 --> 24:58.162
To be your lover, your partner,
your best friend,

24:58.313 --> 25:00.389
Your teammate until the end
in this quest for us

25:00.391 --> 25:02.666
To become the ultimate
power couple

25:02.743 --> 25:06.170
Because I can't wait to start
that fairytale with you.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.339
- All right, so...

25:08.415 --> 25:10.841
I vow to be the best partner
you'll ever have.

25:10.993 --> 25:13.068
I'll always be on your side.

25:13.087 --> 25:15.012
I vow to grow with you
and build with you

25:15.163 --> 25:16.588
What I think will be

25:16.741 --> 25:19.183
A beautiful marriage where
I will learn to be patient

25:19.260 --> 25:21.185
And learn to appreciate you
every day.

25:21.262 --> 25:24.355
I know it might get tough,
but I vow to face challenges

25:24.506 --> 25:27.583
With an open mind and ready
to listen and learn

25:27.601 --> 25:30.861
In order to make
this marriage a success.

25:30.938 --> 25:34.198
Something in this universe
decided we were meant to be.

25:34.349 --> 25:37.368
So we're about to begin
this crazy adventure,

25:37.519 --> 25:40.704
But I can already say
I'm glad it's with you.

25:40.781 --> 25:43.282
- Wonderful.

25:43.434 --> 25:44.542
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:47.788 --> 25:49.362
- You have chosen
these rings as a symbol

25:49.382 --> 25:50.939
Of your marriage covenant.

25:50.958 --> 25:54.385
Breathe, repeat after me.

25:54.461 --> 25:57.888
With this ring.

25:57.965 --> 25:58.947
- Me or you?

25:58.966 --> 26:01.725
With this ring...

26:01.802 --> 26:04.061
I wed you, rachel.
- I wed you, jose.

26:04.138 --> 26:05.804
- For today.
- For today.

26:05.956 --> 26:07.398
- For tomorrow.
- For tomorrow.

26:07.549 --> 26:09.141
- And for all the years
to come.

26:09.293 --> 26:10.626
- All the years to come.

26:10.644 --> 26:12.570
- Please wear it.
- Please wear it.

26:12.646 --> 26:14.238
- As a sign.
- As a sign.

26:14.389 --> 26:16.799
- Of my commitment.
- Of my commitment.

26:16.801 --> 26:18.634
- And a notice
to the entire world.

26:18.652 --> 26:22.805
- And a notice to
the entire world.

26:22.807 --> 26:26.417
That you are my husband.

26:26.568 --> 26:28.085
- You are my wife.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.905
- I think he was happy
to say that last part.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.498
- I was.

26:33.651 --> 26:35.593
- [laughing]

26:35.744 --> 26:39.004
- Jose and rachel
have chosen the lasso ritual.

26:39.156 --> 26:41.657
The lasso is a wedding ritual
in which the couple

26:41.659 --> 26:44.768
Are bound together
with a ceremonial rosary.

26:49.350 --> 26:52.684
With full awareness, know that
within this lasso you are

26:52.837 --> 26:56.004
Bound together before your
friends and before your family,

26:56.006 --> 26:59.283
But you also speak
that intent before god.

26:59.434 --> 27:01.343
Will you honor
and respect one another

27:01.362 --> 27:04.196
And seek to never
break that honor?

27:04.348 --> 27:06.181
Please say, "we will."

27:06.200 --> 27:08.441
- We will.
- We will.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.462
- And now, by the authority
vested in me,

27:11.538 --> 27:15.023
I pronounce you husband
and wife, and jose,

27:15.042 --> 27:19.378
You may kiss your rachel.

Because of these big,
beautiful, brown deer eyes.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.539
She has a great smile.

28:28.615 --> 28:32.543
- Cheers...Hubby.
- And wifey, right?

28:32.694 --> 28:35.454
And so I'm one happy camper

28:35.606 --> 28:38.106
I'm good, I'm good.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.942
- I did not practice
sitting in my dress,

situation today.

Charming, a complete gentleman.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.381
Real quick--
I wanted to play a game.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.716
We say one thing about
ourselves

28:56.736 --> 28:58.460
And see if we have that
in common.

28:58.479 --> 28:59.978

I like that.

29:00.130 --> 29:04.408

I'm houston born and raised?

- Shut up.
- So, yes?

29:20.484 --> 29:21.925
- Yes? Oh...Amazing.
- Yeah.

29:22.077 --> 29:23.260
I went to the world series
all by myself.

29:23.337 --> 29:25.003
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

29:25.155 --> 29:26.930
- You could've called me,
we could've went together

29:27.082 --> 29:29.099
And probably--I could've
proposed on the jumbotron.

you know that's my dream.

Oh, good,
I think we're the same person,

29:59.965 --> 30:01.965
You know, because sometimes
people are like,

30:02.042 --> 30:03.708
"opposites attract," and I'm
like, no, I won't enjoy it.

30:03.861 --> 30:05.803
- That is not fine with me.
- Not with me either, no.

30:05.954 --> 30:07.304
- No, no, no.

30:07.381 --> 30:09.548
They were asking me,
okay, well,

30:09.700 --> 30:11.809
You know, what does she look
like and what do you want her

30:11.960 --> 30:14.202

and I...

I pretty much wanted.

49:56.886 --> 49:58.552

here and there,

and maybe attracted to me...

50:04.910 --> 50:06.577

- ...And all that stuff.

50:06.729 --> 50:08.395

telling me that.

50:08.414 --> 50:10.080
- Yeah, and...
[laughing]

50:10.233 --> 50:13.567
- Because, um, it's actually
low on my list.

50:13.569 --> 50:16.595

rock bottom for me.

50:18.591 --> 50:23.168
Johnny needs more touch
and physical comforting,

at probably someone else's

51:39.004 --> 51:40.429

and they were like,

51:40.581 --> 51:42.005
We're not gonna
wear them again.

51:42.158 --> 51:43.432

51:43.509 --> 51:47.103
You wore them around the house.

not often you think of anyone

51:50.349 --> 51:52.166
That would say something
like what you just said.

58:48.267 --> 58:50.917
It's scary, to me,

58:50.936 --> 58:54.363
How right I see this match.

58:54.514 --> 58:57.107
- You guys raised
a beautiful man.

58:57.259 --> 58:58.759
- Why, thank you.
- Physically and mentally.

58:58.777 --> 59:01.203
[laughing] he's gorgeous.

59:01.354 --> 59:03.187
So thank you for that.

59:03.207 --> 59:06.266
Thank you for making him.

59:06.285 --> 59:08.769
- Well, he--
he is a wonderful soul.

59:08.787 --> 59:11.213
- He goes at everything
with gusto, so we...

59:11.364 --> 59:14.441
Zack attack.
- Zack attack.

59:14.443 --> 59:18.461
- He's all in, or not.

59:18.614 --> 59:21.448
There's no...In-between.
- There's no in-between.

59:21.466 --> 59:22.707
- He goes after everything,

59:22.726 --> 59:24.393
That's just the way
he approaches things.

59:24.469 --> 59:27.712
'cause he's real, um,
single minded.

59:27.731 --> 59:29.565
He's real analytical.

59:29.641 --> 59:31.474
He's on ten.

59:31.627 --> 59:34.311
Math is his favorite...
[echoing]

59:34.463 --> 59:37.130
- Extremely particular...
[echoing]

59:37.149 --> 59:38.632
- He solved a rubik's cube.

59:38.650 --> 59:40.576
- Over, over, over-achiever.

59:40.727 --> 59:42.911
- He'll tell you about an app
he created.

59:45.082 --> 59:48.041
- I think you guys
will be great.

59:51.997 --> 59:53.422
- So you did a thing today.

59:53.573 --> 59:56.425
- Yeah, I know, I got--
I'm married now, you know?

59:56.576 --> 59:58.151
- Married to our sister.

59:58.170 --> 59:59.928
- We're just really
protective of michaela.

1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:02.097
- Why should we trust you
with our sister?

1:00:02.174 --> 1:00:03.390
- I mean...

1:00:07.771 --> 1:00:09.921
Let my actions speak louder
than what I'm going to tell you

1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:12.666
Right now because you'll see

When she's talking
to you guys daily,

1:00:14.186 --> 1:00:16.503
I know you guys are close
and we all hang out together.

1:00:16.521 --> 1:00:18.363
- Yes.
- You'll see it.

1:00:22.678 --> 1:00:24.119
- So how old are you?
- I'm 27.

1:00:24.196 --> 1:00:25.512
- Twenty-seven.
- Yeah.

1:00:25.530 --> 1:00:26.847
- Do you know how old
your wife is?

1:00:26.865 --> 1:00:27.939
- Yeah, 30.
- [laughing]

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.791
- How do you feel about that?

1:00:29.943 --> 1:00:32.519
- I love that, I mean, I'm more
concerned about, um, you know,

1:00:32.537 --> 1:00:34.129
Am I too young for her,
you know what I mean?

1:00:34.206 --> 1:00:36.706
Older women are obviously
more mature.

1:00:36.859 --> 1:00:37.858
I've dated younger women
in the past

1:00:37.860 --> 1:00:39.635
And it just hasn't worked out.

1:00:39.711 --> 1:00:41.695
- What's the longest
relationship you ever held?

1:00:41.713 --> 1:00:44.097
- The longest relationship I've
been in was nine months.

1:00:47.052 --> 1:00:48.869
- So you know, obviously,
michaela needs somebody's

1:00:48.887 --> 1:00:51.872
That's going to be there
for her no matter what.

1:00:51.890 --> 1:00:53.631
- I promise you
I won't let you down.

1:00:53.651 --> 1:00:54.816

1:01:08.056 --> 1:01:09.723
- Is there anything of her,

1:01:09.741 --> 1:01:13.151
Now that you've known her
for a very short period time

1:01:13.170 --> 1:01:15.003
That you are concerned of,
or about?

1:01:18.825 --> 1:01:20.400
- The designer stuff.

1:01:20.419 --> 1:01:23.011
- She also enjoys giving back
and making a difference

1:01:23.088 --> 1:01:25.847
In the lives of those
who are less fortunate,

1:01:25.924 --> 1:01:28.684
Even if it means showing up
dressed in designer clothes

1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.852
At a clothing drive.

1:01:30.929 --> 1:01:32.354
- [laughing]

1:01:32.505 --> 1:01:36.416
Like,
I'm not a designer person,

1:01:36.435 --> 1:01:38.585
You know, I like to dress nice,
don't get me wrong.

1:01:38.603 --> 1:01:41.254
I'm not gonna be at prada
or gucci every weekend.

1:01:41.273 --> 1:01:44.366
- She is very fashionable,
you know, she is high class,

1:01:44.517 --> 1:01:48.261
But she's so driven with
her job and work and profession

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:52.265
That I think the only way
that she can enjoy her success

1:01:52.284 --> 1:01:56.545
Is by splurging every so often.

1:01:56.621 --> 1:01:59.047
- I don't make the most money
in the world,

1:01:59.124 --> 1:02:01.216
And so I'm pretty conservative
about my spending,

1:02:01.293 --> 1:02:03.719
And my wife seems to be
the opposite.

1:02:03.795 --> 1:02:05.554
You know, it makes me wonder

1:02:05.705 --> 1:02:07.389
If that might be
a deal breaker for her.

1:02:09.468 --> 1:02:10.642
- I hope for the best.

1:02:14.398 --> 1:02:16.398
- He does like you a lot,
you could tell he likes you,

1:02:16.549 --> 1:02:20.384
The energy is beautiful, but I
worry about it because when

1:02:20.404 --> 1:02:22.070
It comes to marriage
you compromise a lot.

1:02:22.147 --> 1:02:26.241
So a lot of things you
used to do kind of...Drop.

1:02:26.392 --> 1:02:27.801
- How about sometimes
we cannot be like

1:02:27.819 --> 1:02:30.245
The lifestyle that she has.

1:02:30.396 --> 1:02:33.473
Like, if you're used to
a certain amount of stuff,

1:02:33.492 --> 1:02:36.309
But now with the marriage
some of the stuff will change.

1:02:36.328 --> 1:02:39.662
- Why would my lifestyle
have to change?

1:02:39.815 --> 1:02:41.314
- Gil is extremely cheap.

1:02:41.333 --> 1:02:43.574
That's something could be
interesting in the relationship

1:02:43.594 --> 1:02:46.002
Because I think for gil,
she's going to be pushing him

1:02:46.154 --> 1:02:48.263
To do something that
he might not want to

1:02:48.414 --> 1:02:52.083
Or always doing things her own
way, that could be something

1:02:52.102 --> 1:02:54.603
That could be a problem.

1:02:54.679 --> 1:02:56.271
That's where a lot of
relationships start out

1:02:56.422 --> 1:02:58.164
Really bad and end bad because
it can't be like, well,

1:02:58.183 --> 1:02:59.590
This is where I came from--

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:02.110
No, you gotta come in there,
compromising.

1:03:02.262 --> 1:03:04.613
- I enjoy the lifestyle
that I work hard to enjoy.

1:03:06.191 --> 1:03:07.616
For myself.
- That's true.

1:03:07.767 --> 1:03:10.677
- So I would want
my husband to be able to

1:03:10.695 --> 1:03:12.287
Enjoy those things with me too.

1:03:12.438 --> 1:03:13.863
