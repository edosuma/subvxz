WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.633
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.633 --> 00:04.305
EMILY, THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER--
EDWARD GRAYSON.

00:04.305 --> 00:06.177
I KNOW YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH AMANDA'S FATHER.

00:06.177 --> 00:07.778
MOM,
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

00:07.778 --> 00:09.540
(Conrad) DAVID CLARKE
ISN'T JUST AMANDA'S FATHER.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.582
HE'S YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER
AS WELL.

00:11.582 --> 00:14.545
I AM SUGGESTING THAT YOU
STEP DOWN AS C.E.O.,

00:14.545 --> 00:18.319
AND WE GROOM YOUR SON
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.152
AS YOU WERE WARNED,
REVENGE IS A STONY PATH.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.424
(Nolan) FIRE & ICE.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.726
WAS FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
NOT AVAILABLE?

00:34.265 --> 00:37.568
(Emily) THERE COMES A MOMENT
IN EACH OF OUR LIVES

00:37.568 --> 00:39.570
WHEN THE CONTROL
THAT KEEPS US SANE

00:39.570 --> 00:41.242
SLIPS THROUGH OUR FINGERS.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.414
(gunshot)

00:50.481 --> 00:52.453
(fireworks whistling)

00:52.453 --> 00:55.556
MOST OF US
AIM TO SEIZE IT BACK.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.629
(popping and whistling)

01:00.261 --> 01:02.763
THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT CHAOS

01:02.763 --> 01:04.565
IS WITH CHAOS.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.268
(people speak indistinctly)

01:21.152 --> 01:23.684
(Nolan) WHY ARE WE WASTING TIME
TEARING APART

01:23.684 --> 01:26.117
AN EMPTY MOTEL ROOM?
 (drawers clattering)

01:28.619 --> 01:29.760
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.462
AMANDA MUST HAVE TAKEN
THE BOX WITH HER.

01:31.462 --> 01:33.464
AND LEFT HER PHONE BEHIND?

01:33.464 --> 01:34.765
SHE'S NOT THE ONE
WHO STOLE IT, NOLAN.

01:34.765 --> 01:36.527
EMILY...

01:36.527 --> 01:38.129
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE I KEPT THE BOX.

01:38.129 --> 01:39.530
AND IF SHE DID, SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THIS TO ME.

01:39.530 --> 01:40.871
SHE'S TOO LOYAL.
 (cell phone beeps
and auto dials)

01:40.871 --> 01:42.233
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

01:42.233 --> 01:44.875
(sighs)
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.779
(cell phone rings)

01:48.779 --> 01:50.881
(ring)

01:50.881 --> 01:52.383
(beeps)

01:52.383 --> 01:53.684
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

01:53.684 --> 01:55.686
OR SHOULD I SAY
THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER.

01:55.686 --> 01:58.649
YOUR FATHER HAD
EXCELLENT PENMANSHIP,

01:58.649 --> 02:00.151
BY THE WAY.

02:00.151 --> 02:01.252
TYLER.

02:01.252 --> 02:03.254
I THOUGHT
THEY LOCKED YOU UP.

02:03.254 --> 02:04.855
More like put me up.

02:04.855 --> 02:08.559
SPRING HAVEN HOSPITAL
FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.

02:08.559 --> 02:09.560
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.602
Hey, Nolan.
How's the arm?

02:11.602 --> 02:12.903
WHAT DO YOU WANT, TYLER?

02:12.903 --> 02:14.435
YOU KNOW,
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.736
MONEY WOULD BE NICE.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.908
BUT THEN AGAIN,
SO WOULD VINDICATION.

02:17.908 --> 02:19.910
HOW'S DANNY?

02:19.910 --> 02:21.672
EXCITED FOR THE PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

02:21.672 --> 02:23.574
YOU'LL NEVER GET CLOSE ENOUGH
TO FIND OUT.

02:23.574 --> 02:25.576
I'M CRUSHED THAT
YOU DON'T WANT ME THERE.

02:25.576 --> 02:26.877
STAY BY YOUR PHONE.

02:26.877 --> 02:28.619
OH, AND IF YOU
DO ANYTHING RASH,

02:28.619 --> 02:30.621
LIKE, UH,
CANCEL THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY

02:30.621 --> 02:31.922
OR CALL THE COPS,

02:31.922 --> 02:34.154
YOU CAN KISS
YOUR FRIEND HERE GOOD-BYE.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.787
(whimpers and screams
with muffled voice)

02:36.787 --> 02:38.589
Amanda?

02:38.589 --> 02:39.830
(line disconnects,
cell phone beeps)

02:46.597 --> 02:48.369
DO ME A FAVOR.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.541
NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO GET
A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL DRUNK,

02:50.541 --> 02:52.843
DON'T DO IT HERE.
 NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED
IF YOU HADN'T STUCK YOUR NOSE

02:52.843 --> 02:54.275
WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.446
AND FOR WHAT, SOME CRAZY GIRL

02:55.446 --> 02:56.647
YOU MET FOR ONE SUMMER
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO?

02:56.647 --> 02:58.178
SHE SET A DUDE'S HOUSE
ON FIRE, JACK.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.610
THAT GUY DESERVED IT.

02:59.610 --> 03:00.911
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON WHAT THE GRAYSONS DESERVE.

03:00.911 --> 03:05.185
MAN, YOU'RE REALLY
LOSING IT, YOU KNOW THAT?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.420
(slams)

03:18.929 --> 03:20.301
(clicks)

03:20.301 --> 03:21.632
(beeps)

03:21.632 --> 03:22.773
(man) Sounds like
your voice, Jack,

03:22.773 --> 03:24.605
so I'm guessing I got
the right number.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.308
This is Father Rick
calling from Port-au-Prince.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.639
Last time we spoke,

03:28.639 --> 03:30.481
you were busy settling
your dad's affairs.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.783
I hope that all worked out
as best it could.

03:32.783 --> 03:34.945
I'm calling because I received
a hefty grant

03:34.945 --> 03:36.647
to raise a grade school

03:36.647 --> 03:38.319
and thought,
if you were still interested,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.790
you might want to head up
the project.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.492
If your plate's still full,
fine.

03:41.492 --> 03:44.495
But this is an opportunity
to do some real good, son.

03:44.495 --> 03:46.327
It'd be great
to have you down here.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.330
(beep)

03:49.330 --> 03:51.732
(slurps)

03:54.805 --> 03:57.568
WHO WOULD YOU RATHER
SIT NEXT TO

03:57.568 --> 03:59.670
AT THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY,
THE PAULSONS OR THE CRAIGS?

03:59.670 --> 04:02.242
OH, WE'RE FIDDLING
WHILE ROME BURNS, ARE WE?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.514
THE PAULSONS.

04:03.514 --> 04:05.646
THE CRAIGS IT IS THEN.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.817
(chuckles)

04:06.817 --> 04:08.679
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE,
CONRAD,

04:08.679 --> 04:09.950
TO GLOAT?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.782
YOU ALREADY DESTROYED
ANY CHANCE I HAD

04:11.782 --> 04:13.324
AT EXPLAINING MYSELF
TO CHARLOTTE.

04:13.324 --> 04:14.555
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU WIN.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.686
OH, NOT EXACTLY.

04:15.686 --> 04:17.688
MY FATHER'S THREATENED
TO OUST ME FROM THE BOARD

04:17.688 --> 04:20.361
IF YOU AND I CAN'T REACH
A QUIET SETTLEMENT.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.364
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ANSWER
TO HIM, BUT I DO NOT.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.865
AND IF IT TAKES BLOODYING YOU
ON WALL STREET

04:24.865 --> 04:26.837
TO GET WHAT I'M OWED,
SO BE IT.

04:26.837 --> 04:30.941
WELL, WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU TO PLAY HARDBALL

04:30.941 --> 04:32.473
WHEN YOUR SAFETY NET

04:32.473 --> 04:33.774
JUST STORMED OUT
OF THE HOUSE TONIGHT

04:33.774 --> 04:37.878
LOOKING NONE TO EAGER
TO EVER SPEAK WITH YOU AGAIN?

04:37.878 --> 04:40.611
DANIEL WILL COME BACK TO ME.

04:40.611 --> 04:43.283
HE ALWAYS DOES.

04:46.457 --> 04:47.858
(sighs)

04:52.292 --> 04:55.326
(lock clicks)

04:56.867 --> 04:57.898
(door closes)

04:57.898 --> 04:59.870
(Daniel)
THERE YOU ARE.

04:59.870 --> 05:01.372
DANIEL.

05:01.372 --> 05:02.673
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:02.673 --> 05:03.774
WAITING FOR YOU.

05:03.774 --> 05:06.837
WERE YOU ABLE
TO GET AHOLD OF CHARLOTTE?

05:06.837 --> 05:08.479
SHE'S WITH DECLAN.

05:08.479 --> 05:10.711
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.
SHE SOUNDED DRUNK.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.842
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

05:11.842 --> 05:13.013
(jangles keys)

05:13.013 --> 05:14.845
(cell phone buzzes)

05:14.845 --> 05:16.316
IS THAT HER?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.018
(inhales deeply)
NO.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.820
(exhales)

05:21.952 --> 05:23.894
(inhales and exhales)

05:23.894 --> 05:25.396
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.498
THIRD ONE TONIGHT.

05:27.498 --> 05:28.899
DANIEL, HE'S GROOMING YOU

05:28.899 --> 05:30.901
TO BECOME THE NEXT C.E.O.
OF GRAYSON GLOBAL.

05:30.901 --> 05:32.002
THAT IS HUGE.

05:32.002 --> 05:33.364
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO

05:33.364 --> 05:34.535
TO THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT

05:34.535 --> 05:35.866
LET ALONE TAKE OVER
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

05:35.866 --> 05:37.408
IT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL.
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST

05:37.408 --> 05:39.810
JUST SIT DOWN
AND HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

05:39.810 --> 05:41.642
FINE.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.575
BUT CAN'T WE JUST CANCEL
THE DAMN PARTY?

05:44.575 --> 05:46.677
TRUST ME, NOTHING WOULD
MAKE ME HAPPIER.

05:46.677 --> 05:47.978
BUT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
ARE TRAVELING

05:47.978 --> 05:50.350
HUNDREDS OF MILES TO BE HERE.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.883
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:52.883 --> 05:55.025
JUST PROMISE ME
ONE MORE TIME...

05:55.025 --> 05:58.929
NO SECRETS OF ANY KIND,
EVER.

05:58.929 --> 06:00.931
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT THEY'VE DONE
TO MY FAMILY.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.899
(kisses) LET'S GO TO BED.
IT'S LATE.

06:08.899 --> 06:10.040
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.572
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.817
(closes cabinet)

06:29.660 --> 06:30.821
(clatters)

06:30.821 --> 06:32.893
(chain rattles)

06:32.893 --> 06:34.895
SHE'S NOT WHO YOU THINK
SHE IS, YOU KNOW?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.467
YEAH, SHE'S YOU.

06:36.467 --> 06:37.928
AND YOU'RE HER.

06:39.570 --> 06:40.971
AND HER...

06:40.971 --> 06:43.474
AND HER, AND HER.

06:43.474 --> 06:45.836
AND THEY CALL ME CRAZY.

06:45.836 --> 06:48.439
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT
A BAD PERSON.
 (scoffs)

06:48.439 --> 06:50.080
SHE DOES STUFF TO PEOPLE,
BUT IT'S FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.982
REALLY?

06:51.982 --> 06:53.113
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS GUY?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.446
MASON TREADWELL.

06:55.446 --> 06:58.889
VICTORIA GRAYSON PLANTED
HIS INTERVIEW TAPES ON ME

06:58.889 --> 07:00.020
SO SHE COULD FRAME ME
FOR ARSON.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.852
YOU MEAN THE TAPES
THAT EMILY COPIED

07:01.852 --> 07:04.024
AND STASHED AWAY
IN HER LITTLE BOX OF SECRETS?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.956
(case clatters)

07:05.956 --> 07:08.158
VICTORIA GRAYSON
DIDN'T FRAME YOU. EMILY DID.

07:08.158 --> 07:09.700
(scoffs)

07:09.700 --> 07:11.001
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.903
WHY, BECAUSE SHE'S
YOUR SOUL MATE,

07:12.903 --> 07:14.705
THE SISTER YOU NEVER HAD?

07:14.705 --> 07:16.707
YES.
 MM. OH, LOOK.

07:16.707 --> 07:19.710
11 TEXT MESSAGES ON A PHONE
THAT I PRESUME USED TO BE YOURS

07:19.710 --> 07:22.713
FROM ONE LOVESICK JACK PORTER,

07:22.713 --> 07:25.716
NONE OF WHICH I'M GUESSING
EVER FOUND THEIR WAY TO YOU.

07:28.779 --> 07:30.551
EMILY'S NOT YOUR FRIEND,
AMANDA.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.723
SHE'S YOUR COMPETITION.

07:32.723 --> 07:34.585
YOU NEED MORE PROOF?

07:34.585 --> 07:35.926
(clatters)

07:37.828 --> 07:40.491
HAVE AT IT.

07:40.491 --> 07:41.862
(sniffles)

08:00.010 --> 08:03.013
♪♪♪

08:12.162 --> 08:13.594
CHARLOTTE, IT'S ME.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.925
YOUR FAMILY
HAS BEEN CALLING NONSTOP.

08:14.925 --> 08:16.627
YOU GOTTA FACE 'EM EVENTUALLY.

08:16.627 --> 08:18.799
(sighs)
WHERE'S YOUR MOUTHWASH?

08:18.799 --> 08:21.231
UH, IT'S
IN THE MEDICINE CABINET.

08:21.231 --> 08:22.733
LISTEN, I-I GOT
THE NUMBER HERE

08:22.733 --> 08:24.635
OF A THERAPIST
THAT MY BUDDY WENT TO

08:24.635 --> 08:26.176
AFTER HIS MOM DIED.

08:26.176 --> 08:29.239
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
MINE'S ALIVE AND WELL.

08:29.239 --> 08:31.111
OBVIOUSLY, LOSING YOUR MOTHER
AND FINDING OUT

08:31.111 --> 08:32.883
THAT YOUR READ DAD
IS NOT REALLY YOUR DAD

08:32.883 --> 08:34.745
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS,
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

08:34.745 --> 08:37.017
HE SAID THIS LADY
WAS REALLY HELPFUL, SO...

08:37.017 --> 08:39.289
I CALLED THE OFFICE, AND THEY
SAID SHE HAD A SLOT FOR YOU

08:39.289 --> 08:40.621
THIS AFTERNOON.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.092
(knocks on door)

08:42.092 --> 08:43.594
CHARLOTTE,

08:43.594 --> 08:45.596
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.061
GIVE ME THE NUMBER.

08:51.061 --> 08:52.703
(paper rustles)

08:54.104 --> 08:56.266
(Ashley)
SOUTHAMPTON SURVEILLANCE?

08:56.266 --> 08:57.768
IT'S NOLAN'S SECURITY DETAIL.

08:57.768 --> 08:59.770
I FIGURE, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED THIS SUMMER,

08:59.770 --> 09:02.172
IT'S BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.074
AND YOU OWE ME A FAVOR.

09:04.074 --> 09:05.245
WHY?

09:05.245 --> 09:06.617
DANIEL WANTED
TO CANCEL THE PARTY.

09:06.617 --> 09:07.578
NO, I'D BE RUINED.

09:07.578 --> 09:08.949
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.280
DID HE ALSO TELL YOU

09:10.280 --> 09:12.923
HOW MUCH IT WOULD BREAK
HIS MOTHER'S HEART

09:12.923 --> 09:15.085
OR DOES IT NOT MATTER
TO HIM ANYMORE?

09:15.085 --> 09:16.587
WHY DON'T I LET YOU TWO CHAT,

09:16.587 --> 09:20.090
AND I CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
WITH YOU LATER?

09:20.090 --> 09:23.563
DANIEL IS A FICKLE BOY,
EMILY. (chuckles)

09:23.563 --> 09:25.896
HE LOVES TO SIT ON FENCES.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.599
I HOPE WHEN THAT FENCE
IS HIS OPINION OF HIS MOTHER

09:28.599 --> 09:30.901
THAT I CAN TRUST YOU
TO BE MY ADVOCATE.

09:30.901 --> 09:32.903
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T MADE THAT
VERY EASY FOR ME.

09:32.903 --> 09:34.745
WELL, I REALIZE YOU AND I
HAVE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS,

09:34.745 --> 09:36.576
TO SAY THE VERY LEAST.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.709
BUT IF YOU INDEED PLAN ON
BEING PART OF THIS FAMILY,

09:38.709 --> 09:41.612
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT...

09:41.612 --> 09:43.614
BLOOD WILL ALWAYS
BE THICKER THAN WATER.

09:43.614 --> 09:44.785
MEANING?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.116
MEANING THAT ONE DAY,

09:46.116 --> 09:48.088
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT
BECOME DANIEL'S WIFE,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.661
BUT I WILL ALWAYS BE
HIS MOTHER.

09:50.661 --> 09:52.763
DANIEL FEELS BETRAYED
BY YOU.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.765
IF YOU WANT TO RESCUE
THAT RELATIONSHIP,

09:54.765 --> 09:57.127
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
EARN BACK HIS TRUST.

09:57.127 --> 10:00.100
WOULD YOU FACILITATE
THAT CONVERSATION?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.802
WELL, THAT'S UP TO DANIEL.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.173
(cell phone rings)

10:03.173 --> 10:04.334
EXCUSE ME.

10:04.334 --> 10:05.706
(ring)

10:05.706 --> 10:07.277
(people speaking indistinctly)

10:07.277 --> 10:08.639
(cell phone beeps)

10:08.639 --> 10:09.780
THIS IS EMILY.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.281
(Tyler) Is it?

10:11.281 --> 10:12.612
I thought you'd like to know,

10:12.612 --> 10:15.686
THAT I'VE DECIDED REVENGE
IS A PITIFUL PURSUIT

10:15.686 --> 10:17.948
AND A WASTE
OF MY FLEETING TIME, SO...

10:17.948 --> 10:20.721
let's make a straight-up
ransom deal.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.022
YOU BRING A CASHIER'S CHECK

10:22.022 --> 10:24.024
TO THE SOUTH STRAND
PARKING STRUCTURE AT NOON,

10:24.024 --> 10:27.627
AND I'LL BRING YOUR LITTLE BOX
OF SECRETS.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.959
WHAT ABOUT AMANDA?

10:28.959 --> 10:30.330
After we're done, she's...

10:30.330 --> 10:32.733
ALL YOURS.
 (beep)

10:32.733 --> 10:35.335
(beep)

10:35.335 --> 10:38.108
(indistinct conversations)

10:38.108 --> 10:39.269
HELLO, GRANDPA.

10:39.269 --> 10:40.671
HEY.

10:40.671 --> 10:43.143
THANKS FOR COMING. SIT.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.876
HOW'S YOUR SISTER DOING?

10:45.876 --> 10:47.878
I BET HER HEART'S
IN A MILLION PIECES

10:47.878 --> 10:49.319
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

10:49.319 --> 10:51.021
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH HER?

10:51.021 --> 10:52.723
NOT YET, NO.

10:52.723 --> 10:55.055
BUT DECLAN MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR HER TO GO SEE SOMEONE.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.226
SOMEONE?

10:56.226 --> 10:58.789
YEAH, A THERAPIST
OVER IN BRIDGEHAMPTON.

10:58.789 --> 11:01.261
OH, GOOD FOR HER.

11:01.261 --> 11:05.135
SO LISTEN,
I'VE GOT A JOB FOR YOU.

11:05.135 --> 11:07.798
SEE ALL OF THESE NAMES?

11:07.798 --> 11:10.741
THESE ARE THE INVESTORS
CHIRPING THE LOUDEST

11:10.741 --> 11:12.743
ABOUT THAT RUMORED
S.E.C. INVESTIGATION

11:12.743 --> 11:14.805
AND YOUR FATHER'S
MARITAL WOES.

11:14.805 --> 11:17.848
SEE THE NAME
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST?

11:17.848 --> 11:19.149
SATOSHI TAKEDA.

11:19.149 --> 11:21.381
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HE'S HERE
FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.815
AND HE HAS REQUESTED
A PRIVATE MEETING WITH YOU

11:24.815 --> 11:26.456
THIS AFTERNOON.

11:26.456 --> 11:30.220
SO YOU'RE JOB
IS TO CONVINCE HIM

11:30.220 --> 11:32.863
TO KEEP HIS MONEY PUT.

11:32.863 --> 11:34.995
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

11:37.127 --> 11:39.770
YOUR NAME'S GRAYSON, DANIEL.

11:39.770 --> 11:44.004
THE NAME
MAKES THE DECISION FOR YOU.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.006
(Jack) I ACCEPTED
FATHER RICK'S OFFER.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.808
I SET SAIL TONIGHT, MAN.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.309
MAN, THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE FIGHT
WE HAD EARLIER, RIGHT?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.841
BECAUSE I SAID I'M SORRY,
OKAY?

11:50.841 --> 11:52.943
DEC, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT
AT ALL.

11:52.943 --> 11:56.046
I JUST--I JUST FEEL LIKE
MY LIFE HAS GONE OFF TRACK

11:56.046 --> 11:57.387
AND I GOTTA...

11:57.387 --> 11:59.389
I GOTTA GET IT BACK, MAN.

11:59.389 --> 12:01.892
AND I CAN'T DO THAT HERE.

12:01.892 --> 12:03.293
(chuckles)

12:03.293 --> 12:04.825
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

12:04.825 --> 12:07.257
YEAH, I DO.
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD SUMMER.

12:07.257 --> 12:08.799
AND YOU'RE NURSING
A HEARTACHE

12:08.799 --> 12:11.501
AND SOME BROKEN RIBS.

12:11.501 --> 12:13.103
BUT, JACK, HAITI?

12:13.103 --> 12:14.734
IT'S NOT FOREVER.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.236
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.869
YOU'LL BE IN SCHOOL.
BULL CAN TAKE CARE OF THE BAR.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.011
LOOK...

12:22.442 --> 12:24.875
I WON'T GO. IF YOU
DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE OKAY--

12:24.875 --> 12:26.516
AH, JACK, I'M GONNA BE FINE.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.178
I'M JUST GONNA MISS YOU.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.524
(sighs)

12:34.524 --> 12:37.527
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:42.893 --> 12:44.764
(speaks indistinctly)

12:46.897 --> 12:48.538
CHARLOTTE.

12:48.538 --> 12:52.272
SO WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
IN SUCH A HURRY, YOUNG LADY?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.944
IT WOULDN'T BE
TO A THERAPIST'S OFFICE

12:53.944 --> 12:55.876
IN BRIDGEHAMPTON,
NOW WOULD IT?

12:55.876 --> 12:56.847
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

12:56.847 --> 12:58.879
WELL, WORD GETS AROUND.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.010
BUT LOOK,

13:00.010 --> 13:02.012
I UNDERSTAND HOW POPULAR
IT IS THESE DAYS

13:02.012 --> 13:03.884
TO KICK BACK
ON A DOCTOR'S COUCH

13:03.884 --> 13:06.186
AND PURGE YOUR PROBLEMS,

13:06.186 --> 13:09.289
BUT TRUTH BE KNOWN,
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT,

13:09.289 --> 13:11.221
THEY CAUSE
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

13:11.221 --> 13:12.462
HOW?

13:12.462 --> 13:14.224
IF YOU WERE TELL A STRANGER
THAT YOUR MOTHER

13:14.224 --> 13:16.126
SLEPT WITH A TERRORIST,

13:16.126 --> 13:19.900
AND THEN THAT STRANGER DECIDED
TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION,

13:19.900 --> 13:22.833
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN
TO THE FAMILY'S REPUTATION?

13:22.833 --> 13:25.836
WHEN THE GRAYSON NAME
LOSES VALUE...

13:25.836 --> 13:28.939
SO DOES THE COMPANY.

13:28.939 --> 13:31.581
ARE YOU WILLING
TO GAMBLE AWAY YOUR FUTURE

13:31.581 --> 13:32.812
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.286
IF IT MEANS
NOT LOSING MY MIND, YEAH.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.390
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT DECLAN'S FUTURE?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.594
WHAT ABOUT DECLAN'S FUTURE?

13:44.594 --> 13:46.426
I UNDERSTAND THE KID FLUNKED
HIS ENTRANCE EXAM

13:46.426 --> 13:47.827
TO COLLINS PREP.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.100
NO SURPRISE, I GUESS,
BUT...

13:51.902 --> 13:53.333
FROM THE DEAN.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.566
NOW I'M WILLING TO MAKE A CALL
ON THE YOUNG MAN'S BEHALF,

13:56.566 --> 14:00.340
BUT... EVERY QUID
DESERVES A QUO.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.412
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
THAT, UH,

14:02.412 --> 14:05.175
THERAPIST'S NUMBER ON YOU,
WOULD YOU?

14:16.286 --> 14:17.627
(exhales deeply)

14:17.627 --> 14:18.858
(clears throat)

14:18.858 --> 14:20.190
(phone rings)

14:20.190 --> 14:22.532
(line clicks)

14:22.532 --> 14:23.863
(beep)

14:23.863 --> 14:27.297
MISS EMILY, I THOUGHT
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT--

14:27.297 --> 14:29.469
(clicks)
 HANDS AGAINST THE FENCE,
TYLER.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.271
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
(grunts)

14:31.271 --> 14:33.503
(exhales)

14:33.503 --> 14:34.975
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.376
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN I'M SATISFIED

14:36.376 --> 14:38.048
THAT EVERYTHING'S HERE.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.549
WHERE'S AMANDA?

14:39.549 --> 14:41.912
SHE CAN TELL YOU HERSELF
WHEN I'M SATISFIED

14:41.912 --> 14:43.353
THAT YOU BROUGHT MY MONEY.

14:43.353 --> 14:46.056
AND THE BOX?

14:46.056 --> 14:47.958
THE BOX IS IN THE TRUNK.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.193
GET AMANDA ON THE PHONE.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.965
WITH PLEASURE.

14:54.965 --> 14:57.067
(cell phone auto dials)

14:57.067 --> 14:59.429
YOU KNOW, THAT AMANDA IS
ONE LOYAL CUSTOMER.
 (phone rings)

14:59.429 --> 15:01.071
EVEN AFTER EVERYTHING
I SHOWED HER

15:01.071 --> 15:02.602
ABOUT HOW YOU PLAYED HER
FOR A FOOL,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.104
SHE STILL WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.
 (ring)

15:04.104 --> 15:06.906
YOU MUST HAVE REALLY DONE
A NUMBER ON HER HEAD.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.010
HEY, MANDY. UH, I GOT
YOUR B.F.F. HERE.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.281
LET ME TALK TO HER.

15:11.281 --> 15:12.983
YEAH, GO FOR IT.

15:12.983 --> 15:14.644
SHE'S ACTUALLY
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

15:14.644 --> 15:16.586
WHO'S THE FOOL NOW?

15:16.586 --> 15:19.950
AMANDA, TYLER IS CRAZY.

15:19.950 --> 15:22.092
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT LIES HE'S TOLD YOU,

15:22.092 --> 15:23.593
BUT YOU NEED
TO LISTEN TO ME--

15:23.593 --> 15:25.125
NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.157
I'VE SACRIFICED EVERYTHING
FOR YOU.

15:27.157 --> 15:29.129
I GAVE YOU MY NAME.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.500
AND WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.062
YOU TOOK AWAY THE ONE THING

15:32.062 --> 15:34.064
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
THAT MEANT ANYTHING TO ME.

15:34.064 --> 15:36.436
I HAD TO PROTECT JACK
FROM ALL OF THIS.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.508
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND ME.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.111
(clears throat) ARE WE, UH,
DONE BEING CATHARTIC OVER THERE?

15:41.111 --> 15:43.573
BECAUSE WE'RE WASTING TIME.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.616
(sighs)

15:46.616 --> 15:48.078
AMANDA, DON'T DO THIS.

15:48.078 --> 15:49.949
(clinks)

15:49.949 --> 15:51.121
(snaps)

15:51.121 --> 15:52.983
GOOD GIRL. (clears throat)

15:54.424 --> 15:56.726
START THE CAR.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.428
THE MONEY.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.031
(engine turns over)

16:01.031 --> 16:02.332
I WIRED THE FUNDS
INTO AN ACCOUNT

16:02.332 --> 16:03.633
AT THE CANADIAN NATIONAL BANK.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.036
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO THERE TO GET IT.

16:06.036 --> 16:07.197
PUT THAT OVER THERE.

16:07.197 --> 16:11.201
(engine idling)

16:14.974 --> 16:16.676
PERFECT.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.678
(clears throat)

16:18.678 --> 16:20.550
HAVE FUN AT THE PARTY TONIGHT.

16:20.550 --> 16:21.711
(car door opens)

16:21.711 --> 16:23.983
I HEAR THERE'S GONNA BE
FIREWORKS.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.561
(tires squeal)

16:41.071 --> 16:42.332
(Nolan) NEW GUN?
THAT WAS FAST.

16:42.332 --> 16:43.673
(clicks)

16:43.673 --> 16:46.506
SO YOU'RE DETERMINED
TO TURN THIS PARTY

16:46.506 --> 16:48.108
INTO A FUNERAL?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.580
I'M DETERMINED TO BE
PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.

16:50.580 --> 16:54.144
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
HOW UNPREDICTABLE TYLER CAN BE.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.046
WELL, THEN
JUST CANCEL IT, EMS.

16:56.046 --> 16:57.687
IT'S BEYOND THAT NOW.

16:57.687 --> 16:59.018
(knock on door)

16:59.018 --> 17:01.191
(door latch clicks)

17:01.191 --> 17:03.093
HEY.

17:03.093 --> 17:04.154
HEY.

17:04.154 --> 17:05.655
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

17:05.655 --> 17:07.297
ONE MIDNIGHT CALL

17:07.297 --> 17:09.159
FROM A HAITIAN BENEFACTOR,

17:09.159 --> 17:12.031
AND BAM, OFF YOU GO?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.363
(sighs)

17:13.363 --> 17:15.135
SO WHEN DO YOU SET SAIL?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.136
TONIGHT.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.637
(Sammy whines)

17:17.637 --> 17:19.709
I SHOULD'VE LEFT MONTHS AGO,
BUT, WELL...

17:19.709 --> 17:21.540
LIFE GETS IN THE WAY.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.041
IT DOES MEAN I WON'T BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT

17:23.041 --> 17:24.644
TO YOUR PARTY TONIGHT.
 (chuckles)

17:24.644 --> 17:25.815
(Emily chuckles)

17:25.815 --> 17:27.347
OF COURSE, AFTER THAT LAST
GRAYSONS GATHERING,

17:27.347 --> 17:28.618
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S
GONNA MISS ME.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.282
SO NO WORD FROM AMANDA THEN?

17:32.282 --> 17:35.225
MAYBE I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO HEAR FROM HER.

17:35.225 --> 17:37.287
MAYBE...

17:37.287 --> 17:38.788
BUILDING THIS SCHOOL
IS THE UNIVERSE'S WAY

17:38.788 --> 17:40.390
OF SETTING
MY PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.162
(Sammy whines)

17:42.162 --> 17:44.294
YOU KNOW, AMANDA WILL COME BACK
WHEN SHE'S READY.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.065
AND WHEN SHE DOES,
I'LL MAKE SURE

17:46.065 --> 17:47.837
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
SHE CALLS.

17:47.837 --> 17:50.400
WHAT ABOUT SAMMY?

17:50.400 --> 17:51.801
(Sammy whines)

17:51.801 --> 17:56.106
AH, WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I'M HERE.

17:56.106 --> 17:57.577
IT'S A LONG TRIP,

17:57.577 --> 18:01.151
AND HE'S NOT EXACTLY
A PUPPY ANYMORE.

18:01.151 --> 18:03.183
I DON'T KNOW. THE WAY HE
LIGHTS UP WHEN HE'S AROUND YOU,

18:03.183 --> 18:04.514
I THOUGHT...

18:06.756 --> 18:08.388
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

18:12.722 --> 18:15.094
YOU HEAR THAT, OLD MAN?
 (Sammy whining)

18:15.094 --> 18:16.866
EMILY'S GONNA TAKE YOU IN.

18:16.866 --> 18:18.398
(Sammy pants)

18:18.398 --> 18:20.400
BACK TO WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.204
YOU BE GOOD NOW,
YOU HEAR?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.505
(pants)

18:25.505 --> 18:27.807
WELL...

18:27.807 --> 18:29.239
BYE, JACK.

18:29.239 --> 18:30.410
BYE.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.242
(Sammy whines)

18:39.149 --> 18:40.190
SHUT UP.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.400
BYE.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.237
GO WITH HIM.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.208
NOLAN--

18:58.208 --> 18:59.869
I AM SERIOUS.

18:59.869 --> 19:01.511
SAIL AWAY.

19:01.511 --> 19:03.243
FALL IN LOVE.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.744
GO MAKE
LITTLE VOLUNTEER BABIES.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.517
YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT.

19:07.517 --> 19:08.848
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE SUMMER,

19:08.848 --> 19:10.180
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO HELP ME.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.582
IF YOU MEANT IT,

19:12.582 --> 19:15.355
YOU'LL MAKE SURE HE GETS
ON THAT BOAT SAFELY TONIGHT.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.457
(groans) EMILY.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.628
PLEASE.

19:18.628 --> 19:20.790
(inhales deeply)

19:24.234 --> 19:25.295
JACK!

19:25.295 --> 19:26.636
WAIT UP!
 (whispering) SAMMY.

19:26.636 --> 19:28.198
STAY HERE.

19:28.198 --> 19:30.200
STAY HERE.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.309
WHAT IS THIS?

19:39.309 --> 19:42.882
THIS IS THE DEED
TO GRAYSON MANOR.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.614
AND WHAT ABOUT THE SHARES
OF THE COMPANY?

19:44.614 --> 19:46.586
(laughs)

19:46.586 --> 19:48.688
I TOLD YOU,
THEY WERE A DEAL BREAKER.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.460
I'M NOT GONNA RELINQUISH

19:50.460 --> 19:54.264
GRAYSON GLOBAL, VICTORIA,
NOT TO YOU AND NOT TO MY FATHER.

19:54.264 --> 19:57.497
DANIEL IS GONNA HAVE HIS TIME
AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.968
THIS IS NOT THAT TIME.

19:58.968 --> 20:00.670
SETTLE NOW,

20:00.670 --> 20:01.971
AND I'M GONNA SEE TO IT
THAT YOU GET

20:01.971 --> 20:04.974
FULL CASH VALUE
FOR ALL YOUR SHARES.

20:07.937 --> 20:10.680
WELL, AT LEAST TELL ME
YOU'RE GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.

20:13.983 --> 20:15.885
(cell phone buzzes and beeps)

20:15.885 --> 20:17.317
HEY.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.319
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
YOU'VE BEEN GONE ALL DAY.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.291
COME ON.
 About to step

20:21.291 --> 20:23.323
INTO A MEETING
WITH OUR OLD FRIEND TAKEDA.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.624
TAKEDA?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.326
REALLY?
HE'S BACK IN TOWN?

20:26.326 --> 20:27.997
And coming to the party.
Hey, let me ask you something.

20:27.997 --> 20:29.959
THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS,
YOU HAVE ANY COMMITMENTS?

20:29.959 --> 20:31.861
JUST YOU. WHY?

20:31.861 --> 20:33.803
That's all I need to know.

20:33.803 --> 20:35.435
I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.
 (beep)

20:36.636 --> 20:38.438
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.239
(woman speaks Japanese)

20:40.239 --> 20:41.871
(speaks Japanese)
 PLEASE.

20:41.871 --> 20:44.344
ACTUALLY, MR. TAKEDA,
I'M--I'M NOT STAYING.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.715
(speaks Japanese)

20:45.715 --> 20:48.318
THEY SENT ME HERE
TO CONVINCE YOU

20:48.318 --> 20:49.779
THAT GRAYSON GLOBAL
IS THE PLACE TO BE...
 (speaking Japanese)

20:49.779 --> 20:51.351
BUT IF I CAN'T CONVINCE
MYSELF TO STAY,

20:51.351 --> 20:52.852
HOW CAN I CONVINCE YOU?

20:52.852 --> 20:57.256
(continues speaking Japanese)

20:57.256 --> 20:58.558
(speaks Japanese)

20:58.558 --> 20:59.959
HE SAID,
I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.631
I'M ASKING MY FIANCEE
TO RUN AWAY WITH ME.

21:01.631 --> 21:03.363
(speaking Japanese)
 AND IF SHE SAYS YES,

21:03.363 --> 21:04.534
WE'LL LEAVE TOMORROW.

21:04.534 --> 21:07.537
(continues speaking Japanese)

21:07.537 --> 21:09.639
(speaks Japanese)

21:09.639 --> 21:11.341
THIS IS A BIG DECISION.

21:11.341 --> 21:13.403
VERY,
AND LONG OVERDUE.

21:13.403 --> 21:14.704
(speaks Japanese)

21:14.704 --> 21:16.346
I'LL MAKE SURE SOMEONE
FROM THE OFFICE CONTACTS YOU

21:16.346 --> 21:17.647
AND ANSWERS ANY CONCERNS
YOU MIGHT HAVE

21:17.647 --> 21:19.278
ABOUT MY FAMILY'S COMPANY.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.310
(speaks Japanese)

21:20.310 --> 21:21.811
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

21:21.811 --> 21:23.313
I HAVE SOME TRAVEL PLANS
TO MAKE.

21:23.313 --> 21:24.814
(speaks Japanese)

21:24.814 --> 21:26.316
(cell phone rings)

21:26.316 --> 21:27.687
(speaks Japanese)

21:27.687 --> 21:29.419
(ring)

21:29.419 --> 21:32.291
(ring)

21:32.291 --> 21:34.293
(indistinct conversations)

21:34.293 --> 21:35.595
(beep)

21:35.595 --> 21:39.369
(indistinct conversations
continue)

21:39.369 --> 21:42.031
(man speaking Japanese)

21:42.031 --> 21:43.403
(sighs)

21:43.403 --> 21:44.874
(voice mail beeps)

21:52.412 --> 21:54.313
AHH. HOW DO I LOOK?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.347
UNDER MEDICATED.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.349
OOH. I CAN ASSURE YOU,
I'M THINKING QUITE CLEARLY.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.421
NOT AS CLEARLY AS EMILY.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.353
SHE'S PROBABLY
FIVE STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.

22:03.353 --> 22:04.654
NOT THIS TIME.

22:04.654 --> 22:06.656
I KNOW WHY I WANT PAYBACK.

22:06.656 --> 22:09.859
BUT WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE TO DESTROY HER?

22:09.859 --> 22:12.402
WHY NOT GO BE
A MILLIONAIRE IN CANADA?

22:12.402 --> 22:14.934
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT
THE MONEY, MANDY.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.406
THEN WHAT?

22:16.406 --> 22:18.438
DOES THE NAME FRANK STEVENS
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

22:18.438 --> 22:20.339
SHOULD IT?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.841
HE WORKED FOR THE GRAYSONS.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.342
EMILY BASHED HIS SKULL IN

22:23.342 --> 22:24.844
AND THEN PLANTED HIS WALLET
IN MY POCKET

22:24.844 --> 22:28.347
FOR THE COPS TO FIND.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.750
YOU THINK EMILY
KILLED THAT GUY?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.022
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

22:33.022 --> 22:35.024
WHY ELSE WOULD EMILY
FRAME ME FOR IT

22:35.024 --> 22:38.388
IF NOT TO DISTRACT ATTENTION
FROM HERSELF?

22:38.388 --> 22:39.629
(sighs)

22:39.629 --> 22:42.462
SO WHAT,
YOU'RE JUST GONNA...

22:42.462 --> 22:43.763
KILL EMILY?

22:43.763 --> 22:45.364
NO.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.367
EMILY'S GONNA KILL DANIEL.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.441
OR AT LEAST THAT'S HOW
IT WILL APPEAR TO THE COPS.

22:51.441 --> 22:52.672
(clunks)

22:52.672 --> 22:54.844
AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

22:54.844 --> 22:57.376
NOW WHY DON'T YOU

22:57.376 --> 22:59.409
GET DRESSED?

22:59.409 --> 23:03.052
YOU'VE EARNED YOURSELF
A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

23:04.153 --> 23:05.855
DANIEL'S ABOUT TO FIND OUT

23:05.855 --> 23:08.888
EXACTLY HOW BAD HIS TASTE
IN WOMEN REALLY IS.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.830
(both speak indistinctly)

23:20.830 --> 23:22.502
WELL, I THINK
PRECIOUS METALS...

23:22.502 --> 23:23.873
HI. YOU OKAY?

23:26.876 --> 23:29.539
(indistinct conversations)

23:32.782 --> 23:36.546
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:39.749 --> 23:42.722
LAST-MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS
TO YOUR SPEECH?

23:42.722 --> 23:45.855
A LONG-OVERDUE ADJUSTMENT
TO MY LIFE.

23:45.855 --> 23:48.958
I CALLED YOUR LAWYER
AND I'VE AGREED TO YOUR TERMS.

23:48.958 --> 23:52.161
I HAD HER SEND OVER A MESSENGER
WITH THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

23:52.161 --> 23:54.834
YOU WERE RIGHT, CONRAD.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.206
IT'S TIME TO END THIS.

24:00.810 --> 24:03.773
(pen scratches paper)

24:05.775 --> 24:08.578
RATHER POETIC TIMING,
DON'T YOU THINK?

24:08.578 --> 24:09.819
MM.

24:16.886 --> 24:18.157
SEE YOU AT THE PARTY.

24:32.041 --> 24:34.804
YOU COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A BETTER TIME TO INVEST, GEORGE.

24:34.804 --> 24:37.547
GRAYSON GLOBAL'S ON TRACK FOR
THE BEST QUARTER IN HISTORY.

24:37.547 --> 24:38.878
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

24:52.862 --> 24:54.664
TICK TOCK, CINDERELLA.

24:54.664 --> 24:55.965
TIME'S A-WASTING.

24:55.965 --> 24:59.068
MM. SUDDENLY YOU CAN'T GET
TO THE PARTY FAST ENOUGH.

24:59.068 --> 25:01.971
THE FASTER WE GET THERE,
THE FASTER IT'LL BE OVER.

25:01.971 --> 25:04.604
AND AFTER IT IS,
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.206
WELL, I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU, TOO.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.078
YOUR MOTHER ASKED ME
TO FACILITATE

25:09.078 --> 25:10.810
A DETENTE BETWEEN YOU TWO.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.282
I'M SORRY YOU GOT PUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS.

25:13.282 --> 25:16.285
MM. IT'S WHAT
I SIGNED UP FOR.

25:16.285 --> 25:18.217
COME ON. WE'RE LATE.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.531
(door opens)

25:34.604 --> 25:35.765
(door closes)

25:35.765 --> 25:37.536
YOU DON'T LIKE
MY TASTE IN DRESSES?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.939
I'M NOT GOING TO THE PARTY.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.540
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T GET IN YOUR WAY.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.643
I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.774
(gun clicks)

25:47.617 --> 25:49.879
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.732
MM.

26:02.732 --> 26:04.063
(grunts)
 AAH!

26:04.063 --> 26:05.334
(groans)

26:05.334 --> 26:06.696
AAH!

26:06.696 --> 26:08.037
(Tyler groans)

26:08.037 --> 26:09.769
OHH! (groan)

26:09.769 --> 26:11.671
THERE THEY ARE,

26:11.671 --> 26:13.803
THE FUTURE
MR. AND MRS. GRAYSON.

26:13.803 --> 26:15.344
WELL, SOMEONE'S
IN A GOOD MOOD TONIGHT.

26:15.344 --> 26:16.876
I COULD SAY THE SAME
ABOUT YOU.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.047
I'M ENGAGED TO THE GIRL
OF MY DREAMS.

26:18.047 --> 26:19.208
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

26:19.208 --> 26:20.910
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE GUESTS OF HONOR.

26:20.910 --> 26:22.011
DON'T WE LOOK WONDERFUL.

26:22.011 --> 26:23.983
YOU GOT A MINUTE TO TALK?

26:23.983 --> 26:25.054
OF COURSE, DARLING.

26:28.818 --> 26:30.059
(indistinct conversations)

26:30.059 --> 26:32.822
SWEETHEART,
I KNOW HOW UPSET YOU ARE

26:32.822 --> 26:35.795
ABOUT THE MISUNDERSTANDING
WE HAD REGARDING CHARLOTTE.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.096
YOU MEAN HOW YOU LED ME
TO BELIEVE

26:37.096 --> 26:38.668
HER REAL FATHER RAPED YOU?

26:38.668 --> 26:39.969
I NEVER SAID THAT.

26:39.969 --> 26:42.832
AND IF I HAD ANY IDEA
THAT YOU WOULD...

26:42.832 --> 26:45.875
(indistinct conversations)

26:45.875 --> 26:49.008
THE TRUTH IS THAT I LOVED
DAVID CLARKE VERY MUCH.

26:49.008 --> 26:49.979
GOD, MOM. JUST STOP.

26:49.979 --> 26:51.641
NO, PLEASE. I NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND

26:51.641 --> 26:54.083
HOW MUCH HE MEANT TO ME.
 SAVE YOUR BREATH.

26:54.083 --> 26:57.016
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ANYTHING
ELSE YOU HAVE TO SAY TO ME.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.948
AFTER TONIGHT,
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

26:58.948 --> 27:01.721
I'M TAKING EMILY TO PARIS.
WE'LL GET MARRIED

27:01.721 --> 27:04.023
AND STAY THERE UNTIL WE CHOOSE
THE LIFE WE WANT TO LEAD,

27:04.023 --> 27:06.025
ONE THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
GRAYSON MANOR, GRAYSON GLOBAL,

27:06.025 --> 27:07.827
OR ANYTHING GRAYSON.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.830
WHAT DOES EMILY
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

27:10.830 --> 27:13.032
(indistinct conversations
continue)

27:13.032 --> 27:14.163
HMM?

27:14.163 --> 27:17.106
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER,
HAVE YOU?

27:17.106 --> 27:18.407
(sighs deeply)

27:18.407 --> 27:21.010
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT
SHE'LL GIVE UP THE GRAYSON NAME

27:21.010 --> 27:23.743
AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES
WITH IT SO EASILY?

27:23.743 --> 27:25.945
SHE'S WORKED SO HARD
FOR THE PRIVILEGE

27:25.945 --> 27:28.017
IN JUST THREE MONTHS.
 WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

27:28.017 --> 27:30.319
I'M SAYING
THAT I KNOW THE TYPE.

27:30.319 --> 27:32.782
I WAS ONCE JUST LIKE HER,

27:32.782 --> 27:34.083
AMBITIOUS, DRIVEN.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.985
YES, BY GREED AND INSECURITY.

27:35.985 --> 27:39.358
EMILY IS GENEROUS AND DECENT.
SHE'S NOTHING LIKE YOU.

27:41.030 --> 27:42.962
WELL...

27:42.962 --> 27:46.165
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH,
WON'T WE?

27:46.165 --> 27:47.837
BUT DON'T BE SURPRISED

27:47.837 --> 27:49.198
IF SHE DOESN'T GIVE
YOUR ROMANTIC DELUSIONS

27:49.198 --> 27:52.001
THE WARM RESPONSE
THAT YOU'RE HOPING FOR.

27:52.001 --> 27:55.805
(indistinct conversations
continue)

27:55.805 --> 27:59.048
I CERTAINLY WON'T BE.

SENSEI.

(speaks Japanese)

28:46.856 --> 28:49.098
YES.

28:49.098 --> 28:52.501

ITS RIGHTEOUS PATH.

28:52.501 --> 28:54.163
(indistinct conversations)

28:54.163 --> 28:56.105
A GIFT.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.407
IS THIS...

29:00.039 --> 29:01.370
HOW DID YOU GET IT?

29:01.370 --> 29:03.372
YOUR OPPONENTS ARE DANGEROUS,
BUT CARELESS.

29:03.372 --> 29:05.744
WHAT HAPPENED TO AMANDA
AND TYLER?

29:05.744 --> 29:09.048
TAKE THE BOX.

29:09.048 --> 29:13.182
BURY YOUR FATHER'S SECRETS
AWAY FROM HERE.

29:13.182 --> 29:15.284
WHEN YOU RETURN,

29:15.284 --> 29:17.456
YOUR QUESTIONS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

JACK, WAIT.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.390
AMANDA?

29:51.390 --> 29:52.892
MY GOD.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.563
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:54.563 --> 29:56.265
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

29:56.265 --> 29:59.798
I-I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.130
JACK...

30:01.130 --> 30:03.432
I'M SO SORRY.

30:07.276 --> 30:08.477
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

30:11.210 --> 30:12.942
PORT-AU-PRINCE.

30:12.942 --> 30:14.283
I'M FOLLOWING THROUGH
WITH A PLAN

30:14.283 --> 30:15.945
I SHOULD'VE STUCK WITH
A LONG TIME AGO.

30:17.847 --> 30:19.849
TAKE ME WITH YOU.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.492
AMANDA...

30:23.492 --> 30:25.024
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.056
I KNOW, AND YOU DESERVE
THE ANSWERS, ALL OF THEM.

30:29.598 --> 30:31.560
TAKE ME WITH YOU,

30:31.560 --> 30:33.963
AND I PROMISE,
I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

30:51.981 --> 30:53.182
(laughs)

31:08.637 --> 31:10.239
HEY.

31:10.239 --> 31:12.141
HEY.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

31:12.141 --> 31:16.005
JUST... (exhales)
GETTING SOME AIR.

31:16.005 --> 31:18.507
COME TO PARIS WITH ME.

31:18.507 --> 31:19.648
WHAT?

31:19.648 --> 31:21.911
I-I ALREADY BOUGHT
THE TICKETS. LET'S JUST GO.

31:21.911 --> 31:23.352
(laughs) DANIEL,
THAT'S CRAZY.

31:23.352 --> 31:24.984
THE FURTHER AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY WE ARE,

31:24.984 --> 31:27.516
THE MORE CHANCE WE HAVE
OF DOING THIS RIGHT.

31:27.516 --> 31:29.518
I CAN'T.

31:29.518 --> 31:31.660
MY LIFE IS HERE.
OUR LIVES ARE HERE.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.362
RUNNING AWAY
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

31:33.362 --> 31:35.594
WELL, SOMETIMES,
IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER.

31:35.594 --> 31:39.198
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME HERE
BUT SECRETS AND LIES.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.599
I'M HERE.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.601
AND WHY IS THAT EXACTLY?

31:42.601 --> 31:44.333
WHAT--WHY DO YOU WANT
TO MARRY ME, EMILY?

31:44.333 --> 31:45.674
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

31:45.674 --> 31:46.936
THEN COME AWAY WITH ME.

31:46.936 --> 31:47.906
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

31:47.906 --> 31:49.939
D-DID YOUR MOTHER
SAY SOMETHING?

31:54.383 --> 31:55.684
YEAH.

31:55.684 --> 31:58.087
YEAH, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
SHE DID.

31:58.087 --> 31:59.688
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:59.688 --> 32:01.420
SHE WAS RIGHT.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.353
DANIEL, COME BACK.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.932
(people speaking indistinctly)

32:13.932 --> 32:15.504
THANKS, SKIPPER.

32:15.504 --> 32:17.036
NOLAN CALLED ME THAT.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.607
HE WAS KINDA MY, UH,

32:18.607 --> 32:20.970
MY HALF GILLIGAN,
HALF PROFESSOR.

32:20.970 --> 32:24.573
NOLAN WASN'T EXACTLY
FOND OF ME.

32:24.573 --> 32:27.216
NO ONE IN THIS TOWN IS.

32:27.216 --> 32:29.979
EXCEPT EMILY.

32:29.979 --> 32:31.981
EVERYONE TOLD ME
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU

32:31.981 --> 32:34.283
BUT HER.

32:34.283 --> 32:37.626
EVEN AS I WAS GETTING READY
TO TAKE OFF, TO SAIL AWAY,

32:37.626 --> 32:40.990
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
TO GIVE UP ON YOU.

32:40.990 --> 32:44.994
JUST TO FOLLOW MY HEART.

32:44.994 --> 32:46.735
HOPEFULLY ONE DAY,
YOU'LL GET TO KNOW HER BETTER.

32:46.735 --> 32:48.597
(car horn honks)

32:48.597 --> 32:50.269
(honk)

32:50.269 --> 32:51.740
I, UM...

32:51.740 --> 32:55.704
I STILL OWE--
OWE THE GUY HIS FARE.

32:55.704 --> 32:57.206
(chuckles)

32:57.206 --> 33:00.009
SURE. HERE.

33:02.251 --> 33:03.652
HURRY BACK.

33:06.015 --> 33:07.986
I LOVE YOU.

33:36.385 --> 33:38.016
AMANDA?

33:38.016 --> 33:41.150
HURRY. GO. GO!

33:41.150 --> 33:43.522
AMANDA!

33:46.325 --> 33:48.026
BIG ED.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.658
WILL YOU HANG ON TO THIS
FOR ME?

33:49.658 --> 33:51.160
OKAY, BOSS.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.162
THANKS.

33:53.162 --> 33:56.765
(indistinct conversations)

33:56.765 --> 33:58.067
EMILY.

33:58.067 --> 34:01.340
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.411
WHERE'S DANIEL?

34:02.411 --> 34:03.742
HE'S WALKING THE BEACH.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.075
WE'RE HAVING A THING.

34:06.075 --> 34:08.117
SAME THING
OR DIFFERENT THING?

34:08.117 --> 34:10.119
SAME THING.

34:10.119 --> 34:13.722
(indistinct conversations)

34:15.754 --> 34:17.255
NICE NIGHT FOR IT.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.527
NICE NIGHT FOR WHAT, NOLAN?

34:18.527 --> 34:20.389
CELEBRATING.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.560
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.061
AH, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.434
(chuckles)

34:25.434 --> 34:27.096
EMS...

34:27.096 --> 34:28.397
(indistinct conversations
continue)

34:28.397 --> 34:30.339
IT'S OKAY.

34:30.339 --> 34:32.070
JACK IS GONE.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.072
(indistinct conversations
continue)

34:45.214 --> 34:47.315
SHE'S NOT WORTH IT.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.563
HELLO, DANNY.

34:59.228 --> 35:00.199
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY

35:00.199 --> 35:01.370
WHEN I ASKED YOUR FATHER
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH

35:01.370 --> 35:02.601
ABOUT DAVID CLARKE?

35:02.601 --> 35:04.102
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.774
I NEVER GOT TO FINISH
THE STORY.

35:05.774 --> 35:07.506
I ALREADY KNOW HOW IT ENDS.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.308
CLARKE SLEPT WITH MY MOTHER.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.879
CHARLOTTE'S HIS DAUGHTER.

35:10.879 --> 35:13.282
THAT'S NOT THE ENDING
OF THE STORY, DANNY.

35:13.282 --> 35:16.114
THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.549
HERE.

35:20.549 --> 35:22.351
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

35:27.796 --> 35:29.158
WHAT'S THIS?

35:29.158 --> 35:31.360
WHY DON'T WE CALL
YOUR FIANCEE AND ASK HER?

35:31.360 --> 35:33.732
I DID, AFTER ALL,
FIND IT UNDERNEATH

35:33.732 --> 35:35.304
HER LIVING ROOM FLOORBOARDS.

35:35.304 --> 35:36.865
SHE'S BEEN PLAYING YOU,
BROTHER.

35:36.865 --> 35:38.737
SHE'S PLAYING ALL OF US.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.244
(cell phone beeps)

35:45.244 --> 35:47.145
YOU KNOW, ON SECOND THOUGHT,

35:47.145 --> 35:49.648
ALLOW ME
TO DO THE HONORS.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.650
LET'S TAKE A WALK
DOWN TO THE SHORE.
 (beep)

35:51.650 --> 35:53.482
SHALL WE?

36:05.294 --> 36:08.837
(indistinct conversations)

36:10.399 --> 36:12.441
CHARLOTTE.

36:12.441 --> 36:14.273
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

36:14.273 --> 36:16.305
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.678
I'VE GOT IT.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.850
(indistinct conversations
continue)

36:21.850 --> 36:24.283
CHARLOTTE?

36:24.283 --> 36:27.356
(indistinct conversations
continue)

36:27.356 --> 36:28.657
CHARLOTTE.

36:29.818 --> 36:32.321
HEY, DIDN'T MEAN
TO LEAVE YOU STRANDED.

36:32.321 --> 36:34.192
NO PROBLEM.
 OH, SHE'LL COME AROUND.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.864
MY CHILDREN ALWAYS DO.

36:35.864 --> 36:37.866
THANK YOU FOR
THE TETE-A-TETE WITH DANIEL.

36:37.866 --> 36:39.197
I'M GLAD IT WENT WELL.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.669
WELL, HE TOLD ME ABOUT
HIS SECRET PLAN

36:40.669 --> 36:42.231
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

36:42.231 --> 36:44.233
AND SEEING AS THAT YOU'RE
NOT ON A PLANE TO PARIS,

36:44.233 --> 36:47.676
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT YOU
TALKED SOME SENSE INTO THE BOY.

36:47.676 --> 36:50.208
STAY RIGHT HERE,
WON'T YOU?

36:50.208 --> 36:53.312
AND ALLOW ME TO PROPERLY
SHOW YOU MY GRATITUDE.

36:55.744 --> 36:56.915
(indistinct conversations)

36:56.915 --> 36:58.417
(cell phone chimes)

37:00.819 --> 37:02.251
(beeps)

37:05.454 --> 37:06.625
(beep)

37:06.625 --> 37:09.798
(indistinct conversations
continue)

37:09.798 --> 37:11.630
HEY, YOU REALLY WANT
OUT OF THAT TUX?
 YES.

37:11.630 --> 37:12.931
(man) I JUST DROPPED
A YOUNG LADY OFF

37:12.931 --> 37:14.232
ON FURTHER LANE IN SOUTHAMPTON,

37:14.232 --> 37:16.234
AND I'M HEADED BACK NOW.

37:23.412 --> 37:25.013
AMANDA!

37:25.013 --> 37:26.615
(gunshot)

37:31.380 --> 37:33.382
AMANDA!

37:36.425 --> 37:37.926
(gunshots)

37:39.257 --> 37:42.331
NO, NO, NO, NO!

37:42.331 --> 37:46.034
(fireworks whistling
and popping)

37:46.034 --> 37:47.736
AMANDA!

37:49.838 --> 37:51.400
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:51.400 --> 37:52.901
JACK, I...

37:52.901 --> 37:55.003
I CAN'T--I... (pants)

37:55.003 --> 37:56.875
I DIDN'T--

37:56.875 --> 37:58.407
GO.

37:58.407 --> 38:00.909
MY TRUCK'S UP THE ROAD.
THE KEYS ARE INSIDE.

38:00.909 --> 38:02.481
YOU HAVE TO GO.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.812
NOW.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.588
(whistling and popping
continues)

38:17.596 --> 38:18.997
(thuds)

38:18.997 --> 38:20.329
(Declan) WHERE ARE WE GOING?

38:20.329 --> 38:22.701
(Charlotte laughs)
YOU ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.874
(laughs) SHOW ME
WHAT YOU GOT, BAD BOY.

38:25.874 --> 38:27.506
HERE. I'LL HELP YOU.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.338
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

38:29.338 --> 38:30.509
OKAY. READY TO GO?

38:30.509 --> 38:31.710
YEAH.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.749
OH, COME ON.

38:40.749 --> 38:41.990
KEYS.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.492
FIRE AND ICE.

38:43.492 --> 38:46.855
WHEN WE FIRST SAT DOWN
TO DISCUSS TONIGHT'S OCCASION,

38:46.855 --> 38:48.627
I WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN
BY THE IDEA

38:48.627 --> 38:51.800
OF AN EVENING INSPIRED
BY PRIMAL BOOKENDS--

38:51.800 --> 38:54.403
FIRE AND ICE,

38:54.403 --> 38:55.704
BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS,

38:55.704 --> 38:59.438
AND THE LOVE BETWEEN
A MAN AND A WOMAN.

38:59.438 --> 39:02.441
(laughter and applause)

39:05.374 --> 39:06.875
(cell phone beeps
and auto dials)

39:06.875 --> 39:08.477
(phone rings)

39:08.477 --> 39:11.049
(cell phone rings)

39:12.681 --> 39:13.852
(ring)

39:13.852 --> 39:16.525
YO, YO, 8 MILE,
PRIVATE PARTY HERE!

39:16.525 --> 39:17.856
(ring)

39:17.856 --> 39:19.858
(Victoria speaking indistinctly
with amplified voice)

39:19.858 --> 39:21.630
(cell phone rings)
 (Victoria) STARRY EVENING...

39:21.630 --> 39:23.632
THAT CREEP BETTER NOT
BE TAKING PICTURES.

39:23.632 --> 39:25.363
(ring)

39:25.363 --> 39:26.495
(Victoria continues
speaking indistinctly)

39:26.495 --> 39:27.466
HEY!

39:27.466 --> 39:28.637
(ring)

39:28.637 --> 39:30.068
YOU GOT A PROBLEM?

39:33.542 --> 39:35.974
(Victoria) TONIGHT NOT ONLY
MARKS THE FINAL WEEKEND...
 (rings)

39:35.974 --> 39:38.847
OF A TRULY REMARKABLE SUMMER
IN THE HAMPTONS,

39:38.847 --> 39:40.979
IT IS ALSO THE ENGAGEMENT

39:40.979 --> 39:42.681
OF MY SON DANIEL

39:42.681 --> 39:44.483
TO THE LOVELY AND BEGUILING

39:44.483 --> 39:46.485
MS. EMILY THORNE.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.488
AND THOUGH WE'VE ONLY KNOWN
EMILY FOR A FEW SHORT MONTHS,

39:49.488 --> 39:52.821
SHE ALREADY FEELS LIKE
A PIECE OF THE FAMILY PUZZLE

39:52.821 --> 39:55.424
WE NEVER EVEN KNEW
WAS MISSING.

39:55.424 --> 39:56.825
IN A WORD...

39:56.825 --> 39:59.528
I APPROVE.

39:59.528 --> 40:01.470
(guests laugh)

40:01.470 --> 40:02.931
AND AS ANYONE CAN TELL YOU,

40:02.931 --> 40:05.604
APPROVAL IS NOT SOMETHING
I GIVE AWAY FREELY.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.006
(all laugh)

40:08.006 --> 40:10.539
(lowered voice)
WHERE THE HELL IS MY SON?

40:12.080 --> 40:13.682
MOM!

40:13.682 --> 40:15.784
MOM!

40:15.784 --> 40:18.116
MOM! MY BROTHER...

40:18.116 --> 40:20.418
SOMEBODY COME HERE!

40:20.418 --> 40:22.551
(guests murmuring indistinctly)

40:22.551 --> 40:23.592
(Charlotte) COME HERE!

40:23.592 --> 40:25.924
DANIEL!

40:25.924 --> 40:28.927
(murmuring continues)

40:31.500 --> 40:33.532
(Victoria) DANIEL!

40:40.739 --> 40:42.511
CHAOS...

40:42.511 --> 40:45.614
BY ITS VERY DEFINITION
CANNOT BE CONTROLLED.

40:47.716 --> 40:48.877
HEY.

40:48.877 --> 40:51.179
MY, UH, TRUCK BROKE DOWN.

40:51.179 --> 40:53.482
IS THERE A CHANCE
YOU CAN GIVE ME A RIDE?

40:57.626 --> 40:59.528
THANK YOU.

40:59.528 --> 41:03.832
IT IS AN HONOR
TO BE OF SERVICE.

41:03.832 --> 41:06.094
ONCE INTRODUCED,

41:06.094 --> 41:08.897
ALL ORDER AND INTENTION
IS RENDERED USELESS.

41:08.897 --> 41:10.238
(Victoria) DANIEL!

41:10.238 --> 41:12.070
DANIEL!

41:15.874 --> 41:17.876
GET AWAY FROM MY SON!

41:17.876 --> 41:19.908
DANIEL!

41:19.908 --> 41:21.550
DANIEL, BABY, PLEASE.

41:21.550 --> 41:23.982
(crying)
DANIEL, W-WAKE UP. PLEASE.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.584
BABY, PLEASE!

41:25.584 --> 41:27.816
DANIEL!

41:29.858 --> 41:31.960
IT'S TYLER. OH, MY GOD.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.522
(man) WE NEED TO GIVE THEM
SOME ROOM, OKAY?

41:33.522 --> 41:34.823
STAND BACK, PLEASE.

41:42.671 --> 41:45.103
(Daniel) MOM?

41:55.884 --> 41:59.087
THE OUTCOME OF CHAOS
CAN NEVER BE PREDICTED.

42:00.288 --> 42:03.021
OH, MY GOD.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.923
OH, MY GOD.

42:04.923 --> 42:08.627
(cries)

42:15.033 --> 42:16.665
THE ONLY CERTAINTY
IT BRINGS...

42:16.665 --> 42:17.636
I...

42:19.207 --> 42:21.570
(whispers)
DON'T SAY A WORD.

42:21.570 --> 42:24.943
IS THE DEVASTATION
IT LEAVES IN ITS WAKE.
