00:02.580 --> 00:04.616
Your health is no formality, Mr. Banks.

00:04.780 --> 00:08.568
A man carrying as much weight as you
are at your age has got to face the facts.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.208
Come on, I've kept myself
in pretty good shape.

00:11.380 --> 00:14.690
Well, your blood pressure's up.
You've a history of high cholesterol.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.932
- Come on, I've got a heart like a bull.
- Don't take it for granted.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.412
Although the heart is the strongest
muscle, it has the most responsibility.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.697
There are a lot of things
that can affect your heart.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.408
Morning, all.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.457
- Morning, Will.
- Morning, Master William.

01:57.620 --> 01:59.053
Hey.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.576
- What's up, Aunt Viv?
- Is that doctor still in with your uncle?

02:02.780 --> 02:05.294
Oh, yeah, he sure is, Aunt Viv.
Oh, you know what?

02:05.460 --> 02:08.691
I heard the doctor say he thinks
Uncle Phil might have Dunlap syndrome.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.095
Dunlap syndrome? What's that?

02:11.380 --> 02:14.690
Mean his belly done lapped
over his belt.

02:18.660 --> 02:22.096
Hold on a minute.
I'll have you know my father is not fat.

02:22.260 --> 02:24.490
He's just big-boned.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.093
Larger than life.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.610
Yeah, he's also larger
than the Volvo.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.692
Will, it's not funny.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.891
Cholesterol is gathering
in his arteries...

02:34.060 --> 02:36.654
...stopping the blood flow
like rush-hour gridlock.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.978
Hold it, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.416
Dad will probably outlive all of us.

02:42.940 --> 02:45.295
Only if he eats us first.

02:46.820 --> 02:50.972
And you wonder why Daddy won't give
you money for your little trip to Mexico.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.369
But if you ask me...

02:52.540 --> 02:55.498
...I think it's a waste of time
to even consider life insurance.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.890
Now, honey, your father's
a very responsible man.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.814
He wants to make sure that if anything
happens to him, we'll be taken care of.

03:02.020 --> 03:06.138
That's true. After all, Daddy has gotten
us used to living this fancy lifestyle.

03:06.340 --> 03:09.537
Oh, did I tell you?
I went in on a racehorse.

03:11.340 --> 03:12.534
- Hey, what's up?
- Will.

03:12.740 --> 03:14.059
- Good morning, sir.
- Geoffrey.

03:14.220 --> 03:16.290
- What did the doctor say?
- Everything's fine.

03:16.460 --> 03:19.497
Well, he was a little worried
about my weight.

03:20.580 --> 03:23.617
Do you realize you're eating
about a million grams of fat?

03:23.780 --> 03:25.133
Thank you, honey.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.773
I'm serious, Daddy.

03:26.980 --> 03:30.177
I'm not gonna sit here and watch you
eat yourself into an early grave.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.972
- Okay, then you're excused.
- Fine.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.653
- Hey.
- Ashley, what are you doing?

03:33.820 --> 03:37.051
Something you all should've done
a long time ago.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.608
Well, she does have a point,
Uncle Phil.

03:40.780 --> 03:43.499
I mean, hey, I'm getting tired
of the fat jokes myself.

03:43.660 --> 03:45.537
What is wrong with you people?

03:45.700 --> 03:48.737
I weigh the same thing
I weighed in high school.

03:51.140 --> 03:54.212
Yeah, if you add up all four years.

03:57.180 --> 04:00.331
Guess I'm not getting as tired
of those fat jokes as I thought, huh?

04:02.100 --> 04:04.660
I'm worried about you, Daddy.
I love you.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.053
Ashley, sweetheart...

04:07.260 --> 04:10.411
...if you feel that way about it,
I'll go on a little diet.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.808
- You promise?
- I promise.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.572
- And you'll exercise too?
- Well...

04:13.740 --> 04:15.935
If you want a good workout,
go with me tomorrow.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.172
- Where are you going?
- Shooting the rapids at Dead Man's Falls.

04:19.339 --> 04:22.650
See, my therapist said the only way
for me to get over Trevor's death...

04:22.860 --> 04:24.054
...is to confront it.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.012
But Trevor died doing a bungee jump.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.569
I know. I'm working up to that.

04:28.740 --> 04:31.812
Well, I'm off to my skydiving class.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.619
Whoa, whoa, Hil.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.414
That's not your parachute.
That's my book bag.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.654
That would've been embarrassing.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.649
Yo, Carlton, what's up, man?
What you working on?

04:48.860 --> 04:50.612
It's an assignment from English class.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.010
I'm supposed to imagine myself
20 years from now.

04:53.180 --> 04:55.614
No wonder you're so depressed.

04:56.420 --> 05:00.129
I figure, 20 years from now, my dad will
be taking his seat on the Supreme Court.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.689
We'll still see each other,
especially on weekends...

05:02.860 --> 05:05.613
...when he and Mom come by
to see me and little Carlton.

05:06.660 --> 05:08.651
You are little Carlton.

05:09.740 --> 05:12.812
And if the family is at all consistent
my wife's wise-guy nephew...

05:12.980 --> 05:15.540
...will move in
and make my life a living hell.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.454
Your wife?

05:17.620 --> 05:19.292
Oh, this is science fiction.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.810
Oh, Uncle Phil.
Hey, you been out on the courts?

05:24.980 --> 05:26.732
Played a little tennis with Ashley.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.175
I can't remember
when I've worked up such a sweat.

05:29.340 --> 05:31.900
And you've certainly
earned your lunch.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.177
What the heck is this?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.138
Chicken, sir.

05:38.300 --> 05:43.090
You probably don't recognize it without
a thick coating of batter and gravy.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.013
I can't do this.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.297
I can't give up my favorite foods
cold turkey with...

05:49.460 --> 05:51.257
Oh, my God.

05:51.460 --> 05:53.178
Turkey.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.896
With pillowy mounds
of mashed potatoes...

06:00.820 --> 06:05.610
...butter-drenched dressing,
tiny onions...

06:05.780 --> 06:09.216
...swimming in a sea of cream sauce.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.049
Yo, Uncle Phil,
snap out of it, man.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.774
Come on, now, those days are over.
You promised Ashley.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.056
You're right, Will. You're right, I did.

06:18.260 --> 06:19.932
Geoffrey...

06:20.340 --> 06:22.695
...I could make this worth your while.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.135
Well, sir, for a price...

06:25.300 --> 06:28.451
...I could show you something
in a greasy snack.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.499
What's going on here?

06:36.940 --> 06:39.408
Put your hands up.

06:39.580 --> 06:42.492
Step away from the chips.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.497
Listen, Dad, you might not care
about how clogged your arteries are...

06:47.660 --> 06:49.890
...but I do, and I'm doing
something about it.

06:50.060 --> 06:53.848
- And doing a wonderful job, I might add.
- Shut up, Geoffrey.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.699
The kitchen is officially closed
for high-fat inventory.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.937
Come on.

06:59.940 --> 07:03.569
Will, could I speak to you
in the family room, please?

07:03.740 --> 07:06.049
Oh, yeah, sure thing, Uncle Phil.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.537
- About what?
- This.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.055
This is crazy.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.452
Come on, what you talking about,
Uncle Phil?

07:14.860 --> 07:16.851
Oh, this one's easy.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.570
Ashley hid the remote control,
so I have to walk to the TV.

07:21.740 --> 07:24.698
Geoffrey's feeding me
all kinds of healthy food.

07:24.860 --> 07:27.055
Why does she hate me, Will?

07:27.220 --> 07:30.496
Come on, Uncle Phil. I say she's
just following the doctor's orders.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.730
You gotta lose some weight, man.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.777
But this is getting out of hand.

07:34.940 --> 07:38.649
Ashley has spies at every
fast food restaurant for miles.

07:39.700 --> 07:44.455
You know, I'd give anything
for a cheeseburger, Will.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.571
Anything.

07:46.740 --> 07:51.097
Why, I might even finance
your little trip to Mexico.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.211
How you trying to play me,
Uncle Phil?

07:54.580 --> 07:57.811
Mexico is important to me,
but not if it will jeopardize your health.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.659
Look, I know the doctor's
telling the truth.

08:00.820 --> 08:03.812
It's just, I've got a lot going on.
I'm under a lot of pressure.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.733
You let me get
a running start at this diet.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.458
See?

08:17.420 --> 08:19.331
How much running you talking about?

08:19.660 --> 08:20.809
Well...

08:20.980 --> 08:25.895
Well, I'll make a New Year's resolution,
and by March... February...

08:26.100 --> 08:28.773
...you won't even recognize
your old Uncle Phil.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.737
And that's this New Year's, right?

08:30.940 --> 08:35.172
Well, you have my solemn vow.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.057
- Well, I'm off.
- What are you dressed for?

08:43.380 --> 08:47.214
I'm learning to drive
a Formula 1 racecar.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.292
Hilary, I've had enough
of your death-defying stunts.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.052
And I want it stopped now.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.179
What he means, dear...

08:57.340 --> 09:01.128
...is we don't wanna see you
taking risks like this.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.736
My therapist was right.
You just aren't nurturing enough.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.818
Mom, I don't think
we can go to the movies tonight.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.493
Why not?

09:12.420 --> 09:16.049
No one's gonna be home except for Dad.
I'm afraid he's gonna cheat on his diet.

09:16.220 --> 09:19.018
What? You don't think
you can trust me?

09:19.180 --> 09:22.013
Don't worry, honey, there's no
unhealthy food in the house...

09:22.180 --> 09:23.977
...and I'll take the car keys
with me.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.369
This is ridiculous.

09:25.540 --> 09:29.897
Okay, I'll put all the local pizza places
on alert, and tell them not to deliver.

09:30.380 --> 09:33.053
Doesn't my word
mean anything to you?

09:33.220 --> 09:35.529
Of course it does, darling.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.168
Better call the Chinese restaurants too.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.377
You got the stuff?

10:02.860 --> 10:04.498
Right here.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.411
You got the money?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.892
You take a check?

10:10.060 --> 10:14.212
- I'm leaving for Mexico in a hour.
- I don't know if I have that cash on me.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.099
I hope there's an ATM.
I've been buying your food all week.

10:17.260 --> 10:21.253
- I got no problem eating your dinner.
- All right, all right, all right. Here.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.819
It's good to see you're
not wasting time chewing.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.296
See, that's what you get
for eating all fast.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.576
Let me get you something for that.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.219
Here's one, Uncle Phil.

10:43.380 --> 10:46.178
Relieves cramps, bloating
and irritability.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.609
Oh, no, no, this is Geoffrey's.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.530
- Will...
- Oh, here's one, Uncle Phil.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.930
It says it relieves gas
and I got to be honest...

10:55.100 --> 10:57.773
...the past couple of days
you've been a little...

10:58.500 --> 11:00.968
- No.
- Oh, what you want?

11:01.140 --> 11:04.815
I want an ambulance.
I think I'm having a heart attack.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.009
That's a nice hat.

11:34.020 --> 11:37.092
Thanks a lot, man.
Look, is my uncle gonna be all right?

11:37.260 --> 11:40.058
Don't worry,
he's my fourth heart attack today...

11:40.220 --> 11:43.292
...and I already lost one of them.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.576
A two-death day is rare.

11:47.020 --> 11:50.456
I don't care how rare it is. You better
make sure you don't lose this one!

11:50.660 --> 11:53.891
- Will, I can't breathe.
- Hey, my uncle can't breathe, man!

11:54.060 --> 11:56.528
Could be because
you're leaning on his air hose.

11:59.020 --> 12:00.248
I'm sorry.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.490
I'm gonna be all right, Will.
I'll be fine.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.890
You go with your friends to Mexico.
I'll be okay.

12:05.060 --> 12:07.176
No, no, no. I'm with you, man.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.490
I'm staying with you till the end.

12:09.660 --> 12:13.016
That was a really poor choice
of words. I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.812
Would you do me a favor, Will?

12:15.060 --> 12:17.051
We are not stopping for no burger.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.579
No, no...

12:20.580 --> 12:25.495
Would you tell Carlton
to look after the family, Will...

12:25.660 --> 12:27.855
...just in case this is my last ride?

12:29.180 --> 12:31.535
Your last ride?
What you talking about, man?

12:31.700 --> 12:34.260
We gonna go for plenty rides
in ambulances, man.

12:35.940 --> 12:38.613
I mean, you gonna be all right,
Uncle Phil.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.419
Hey, man, he is gonna be all right,
isn't he?

12:42.580 --> 12:47.290
Well, if I say he is and he croaks,
you're gonna be upset, right?

12:53.580 --> 12:56.219
You're a real people person,
aren't you?

12:56.460 --> 12:57.688
I guess.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.690
Hey, if he still wants to stop
for a burger...

13:00.860 --> 13:04.136
...I can get Troy
to swing by the drive-through.

13:04.300 --> 13:08.009
With the siren on,
we don't have to wait in line.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.255
Why are they taking so long
with those tests?

13:21.540 --> 13:25.897
The emergency doctor
said it's routine with heart attacks.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.734
Where's Carlton?

13:28.900 --> 13:32.290
I left a message on the phone machine.
I was sure he'd be here by now.

13:32.500 --> 13:36.049
This is all my fault. I pushed Daddy
way too hard on the tennis courts.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.251
No, Ashley, it was me.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.651
I scared him half to death
with my stupid thrill-seeking.

13:41.940 --> 13:45.137
I'm afraid, dear family,
that I am the culprit.

13:45.340 --> 13:46.568
What do you mean, Geoffrey?

13:46.740 --> 13:49.971
Years of my rich sauces,
prime cuts of beef...

13:50.140 --> 13:53.974
...sumptuous desserts
have certainly gone to his heart.

13:54.140 --> 13:56.529
Yes, but if I wasn't there
to excuse his behavior...

13:56.700 --> 13:58.292
...this never would've happened.

13:58.460 --> 13:59.893
Good point.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.939
You can't blame yourself, Mom.

14:04.140 --> 14:07.928
"Oh, go ahead, Philip, have dessert.
You've had a hard day."

14:08.100 --> 14:11.172
"Not to worry,
we can let those pants out."

14:11.380 --> 14:15.817
"I'm too tired. Go downstairs
and have a snack."

14:21.940 --> 14:25.410
I hate to interrupt this guilt-fest...

14:25.580 --> 14:27.889
...but I think I have to take the rap
for this one.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.819
Well, you have been a little wild
these past four years.

14:30.980 --> 14:33.813
Not to mention your negative
influence on Carlton.

14:33.980 --> 14:37.575
Let's not forget
his constant barrage of fat jokes.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.533
Or his elephant jokes.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.731
Stop it, everybody.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.538
You're making Will feel bad.

14:44.220 --> 14:46.939
No, no, it's cool, Ash. They're right.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.216
It is my fault.

14:49.380 --> 14:52.417
Especially since I've been sneaking
him food for the past week.

14:52.620 --> 14:53.973
- You what?
- Nothing...

14:54.180 --> 14:56.774
I mean, he said it was only
going to be until New Year's.

14:56.940 --> 14:59.056
- How could you?
- Well, it wasn't all bad food.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.780
I mean, the fried rice
had bean sprouts in it.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.970
Uncle Phil, I'm sorry, man.

15:24.900 --> 15:28.290
You wouldn't even be in here
if I wasn't sneaking you food.

15:31.540 --> 15:35.453
Look, I love you, man.
I never meant to hurt you.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.217
I'm sorry.

15:42.980 --> 15:44.971
Uncle Phil, what are you doing there?

15:45.260 --> 15:47.694
I had a heart attack, Will.

15:49.140 --> 15:52.735
Hey, how come you didn't tell me
you weren't my uncle, man?

15:52.940 --> 15:54.931
Well, nobody ever comes to visit me.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.660
I crave the attention.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.339
Will, see if he's gonna finish his IV.

16:03.780 --> 16:06.977
Yeah, me bringing you food is what
got you in here in the first place.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.610
What? You think a week's worth
of chili burgers put me in here?

16:10.780 --> 16:14.090
Forget about it. It's from years
of not taking care of myself.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.052
Yeah, but I ain't had to help you.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.694
Come on, I hustled you to get food.
Nobody blames you.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.289
A whole room full of people
with a different opinion.

16:21.460 --> 16:22.893
Oh, the family's here?

16:23.060 --> 16:25.210
Well, just about.
Carlton's not here yet.

16:25.380 --> 16:26.893
No?

16:27.260 --> 16:30.297
We left a message for him.
He probably just didn't get it yet.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.616
Yeah. Yeah, sure. That's it.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.492
- That Carlton your son?
- Yes.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.972
Yeah, I got a son.
He don't come to visit me either.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.976
- I'll send the family in, Uncle Phil.
- Okay.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.895
Excuse me. Are you the Banks family?

16:47.220 --> 16:49.654
- Yes, we are.
- I'm Dr. Kevarkian.

16:53.460 --> 16:56.930
Not Kevorkian.
Kevarkian with an A.

16:58.860 --> 17:00.339
How's my father doing?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.139
He's going to be fine.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.689
But he's gonna have to start
taking care of himself.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.219
Is he still awake?

17:06.380 --> 17:07.699
You can go see him.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.654
- Why don't you take the baby home.
- Very well, Miss Hilary.

17:11.819 --> 17:15.017
Is that Carlton?
Mr. Banks has been asking for him.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.650
Carlton's a little bigger,
wears a bow tie.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.690
Oh, doctor, before I leave...

17:21.859 --> 17:24.532
...could I ask you a couple of
questions...

17:24.700 --> 17:26.656
...about ointments?

17:30.460 --> 17:32.496
Don't be stupid, Carlton.
What are you doing?

17:32.660 --> 17:35.015
Cleaning the oven.
What's your problem?

17:36.580 --> 17:38.457
How come you're not
at the hospital, man?

17:38.620 --> 17:41.498
It says right here on the label
to let foam sit for 45 minutes.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.888
My hands are tied.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.369
Carlton, what's the matter
with you, man?

17:49.540 --> 17:52.054
- Your father had a heart attack...
- You don't know that.

17:52.220 --> 17:55.292
It could be acute indigestion.
Even doctors have made that mistake.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.337
Does that window
look smudged to you?

18:00.340 --> 18:04.652
Carlton, you're going down to that
hospital if I have to knock you out...

18:04.820 --> 18:08.210
...and call an ambulance.
- You come near me, I'll spray.

18:10.060 --> 18:12.528
Man, you don't know
how lucky you are.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.454
You can be with your father
whenever you want.

18:15.620 --> 18:19.010
You can eat with him and argue
with him. He's there for you.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.812
You know where my father is?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.374
No.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.452
Neither do I.

18:24.620 --> 18:28.249
Look, I don't wanna see my father
with tubes up his nose, okay?

18:28.660 --> 18:31.572
There's gonna come a time
when all he has is tubes up his nose...

18:31.740 --> 18:33.458
- Not my father!
- Everybody's father!

18:33.660 --> 18:36.493
Except mine because
I don't know where the hell he is!

18:39.300 --> 18:41.530
You don't understand, Will.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.812
Yes, I do.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.015
You're selfish.

18:52.620 --> 18:55.498
Your father's resting.
Why don't you take your family home.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.658
Oh, well, they finally fell asleep.
I don't wanna wake them.

18:58.820 --> 19:00.048
You don't sleep?

19:00.220 --> 19:02.529
I've got a lot on my mind,
Dr. Kevorkian.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.975
Kevarkian with an A.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.415
Call me Russell. I'm on break now.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.048
You wanna go downstairs
and have an early breakfast?

19:12.020 --> 19:18.289
Well, thank you, Russell,
but I can't.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.849
- I'm in mourning.
- Your father's gonna be fine.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.132
Oh, no. See, my fiancé
had this unfortunate accident.

19:24.300 --> 19:27.098
That's why I was supposed
to go bungee jumping earlier today.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.216
- Dr. Martling said... Do you know him?
- No.

19:29.380 --> 19:33.168
He's my therapist. He thought if I
jumped from the same place Trevor ju...

19:33.340 --> 19:34.773
He didn't exactly say that.

19:34.980 --> 19:38.211
You know how your therapist says one
thing and means something else...

19:38.380 --> 19:40.450
...and you have to figure out
therapist talk?

19:40.620 --> 19:43.930
- You can never understand...
- Oh, look at that, I'm being beeped.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.898
I didn't hear any beep.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.779
Dad?

20:04.940 --> 20:07.500
- Are you okay?
- Me?

20:07.660 --> 20:10.936
I'll be fine.
I'll be out of this bed in no time.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.498
How about you?

20:14.420 --> 20:16.729
- Are you okay?
- Me?

20:16.940 --> 20:18.976
Sure, I mean...

20:22.300 --> 20:25.895
I should've come sooner, Dad, but I
was scared. You're like Superman to me.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.814
Yeah...

20:27.980 --> 20:30.540
...cheesecake is my kryptonite.

20:34.740 --> 20:36.617
I'm sorry I let you down, son.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.534
You could never let me down, Dad.

20:44.060 --> 20:45.698
I love you.

20:50.260 --> 20:54.538
Hey, Superman,
ask junior to get me a bedpan.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.939
Whoop, there he is.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.175
Oh, man. Hey, Uncle Phil,
bet you never thought...

21:11.340 --> 21:13.296
...you'd get
a standing O in this house?

21:13.500 --> 21:16.139
There was a time I never thought
I'd see this house again.

21:16.300 --> 21:19.610
You was probably worried about
just seeing this kitchen again, right?

21:19.780 --> 21:22.169
I'm sorry, that's a leftover fat joke.
I'm tripping.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.537
Go ahead.
Well, you get them in while you can.

21:25.740 --> 21:29.255
Soon I'll be a lean, mean
judicial machine.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.497
I'll cover all bets on that one.

21:33.540 --> 21:37.579
Daddy, we're not gonna do anything
to make you upset ever again.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.896
Oh, by the way,
I dented the Mercedes.

21:42.940 --> 21:47.138
Sweetheart, I am so glad
to have you home safe and well.

21:47.300 --> 21:52.294
And if you ever do anything
to scare me like that again, I'll kill you.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.018
Don't worry, I won't.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.455
I'm lucky to have
such a wonderful family.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.177
Even my pain-in-the-butt
nephew.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.774
- I love you too, Uncle Phil.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.329
- Hey, come on, let's go watch some TV.
- Okay.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.333
- There's still no furniture.
- Oh, that's all right.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.970
Oh, man, we don't have no remote.

22:11.140 --> 22:14.098
Sure we do. Geoffrey!

22:20.060 --> 22:23.416
Do you realize you're eating
about a million grams of fat?

22:23.580 --> 22:24.854
Thank you, honey.

22:25.020 --> 22:27.375
Geoffrey, you're skimping
on the provolone, huh?

22:27.540 --> 22:29.292
I'm serious, Daddy.

22:29.460 --> 22:33.453
I'm not gonna sit here and watch
you eat yourself into an early grave.

22:33.660 --> 22:36.254
So you're gonna throw a fork at me?

22:36.420 --> 22:38.980
I tried to keep going.

22:39.860 --> 22:41.737
Hold, please!
