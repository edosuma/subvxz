00:49.200 --> 00:51.743
Before the end
of the season last year...

00:51.911 --> 00:55.622
...and then re-injured it
in spring training...

00:55.790 --> 00:58.291
...on a terrific game-saving play.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.502
You know, I was talking with...

01:00.669 --> 01:04.547
What time is this going on?
7:30 is the pre-game.

01:04.715 --> 01:07.759
Who'd you say was pitching?
Tiant's pitching.

01:07.927 --> 01:11.971
Goddamn Cuban. He can hurl it.
I'd hate to be facing him.

01:12.139 --> 01:15.184
Who are they playing, Yankees?
Yankees.

01:15.352 --> 01:18.020
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball
coming at you.

01:18.188 --> 01:19.939
- You don't have time to think.
Hey, guys!

01:20.107 --> 01:22.525
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

01:22.692 --> 01:24.860
He's been hot lately.

01:25.028 --> 01:30.241
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

01:43.672 --> 01:45.339
Save.

01:45.507 --> 01:46.757
The sewer.

01:54.683 --> 01:56.267
Hold on, I'll get it.

01:57.435 --> 02:01.064
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

02:01.232 --> 02:04.901
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

02:11.075 --> 02:12.325
Hey...

02:13.494 --> 02:15.745
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

02:15.913 --> 02:18.540
What?
- Driving a car.

02:18.708 --> 02:20.792
You know, just around the block.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.752
Yeah?

02:22.920 --> 02:26.423
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

02:26.591 --> 02:30.343
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

02:30.511 --> 02:33.388
Just around the block. Who said steal?

02:45.860 --> 02:48.779
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

03:08.342 --> 03:10.509
See, now it'll be there forever.

03:12.346 --> 03:14.138
Me too.

03:16.516 --> 03:18.309
Forever.

03:21.813 --> 03:23.981
Let me ask you something.

03:28.569 --> 03:31.613
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

03:35.494 --> 03:37.203
Come here.

03:39.706 --> 03:40.998
Get over here.

03:54.096 --> 03:55.513
Well, do you?

03:56.139 --> 03:58.849
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

03:59.017 --> 04:01.477
- No.
- No, what?

04:03.689 --> 04:05.648
Sir.

04:05.816 --> 04:08.526
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

04:11.363 --> 04:13.406
A pack of punks, huh?

04:16.243 --> 04:18.702
You live around here?

04:18.870 --> 04:21.039
Right there.

04:25.211 --> 04:26.920
You?

04:27.088 --> 04:29.089
Right over there.

04:31.175 --> 04:33.218
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

04:35.471 --> 04:38.598
- Rester Street.
- Is your mother home?

04:45.273 --> 04:50.402
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

04:57.827 --> 05:00.078
Get in.

05:02.206 --> 05:04.583
Get the fuck inside.

05:20.517 --> 05:22.310
In.

05:26.607 --> 05:30.068
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

05:35.908 --> 05:39.619
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

06:08.066 --> 06:10.317
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

06:10.485 --> 06:12.444
The cop. He had a gold badge.

06:12.612 --> 06:15.656
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

06:15.824 --> 06:18.158
- No, no writing.
- He had a uniform on?

06:18.326 --> 06:19.993
Like a regular police uniform?

06:20.161 --> 06:22.329
He was a cop.
He took Davey.

06:22.497 --> 06:26.500
- So, what were you guys doing?
- We wrote our names in the cement...

06:26.668 --> 06:30.212
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

06:30.380 --> 06:33.966
- That doesn't make sense. Come on.
Is there something wrong, Dad?

06:53.571 --> 06:55.196
Please.

06:55.364 --> 06:57.282
No more.

06:58.159 --> 07:00.201
Please.

07:01.495 --> 07:03.705
No more, please.

07:32.402 --> 07:35.404
Have you seen him?
- Looks like damaged goods to me.

07:35.572 --> 07:37.490
Jesus.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.110
You took some good swings today.

08:15.278 --> 08:17.697
Dad, I struck out.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.493
Good swings, though.
That's what counts.

08:22.119 --> 08:25.163
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

08:25.581 --> 08:29.960
Hey, you're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

08:30.211 --> 08:34.756
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

08:34.924 --> 08:37.592
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

08:40.011 --> 08:41.471
Hey.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.807
- See that gutter drain over there?
- Yeah.

08:45.684 --> 08:49.103
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

08:49.271 --> 08:52.606
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

08:52.774 --> 08:56.235
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.363
If we could get that manhole cover up...

08:59.531 --> 09:01.490
...could be 1000 balls down there.

09:01.658 --> 09:04.828
Really? Let's try.

09:33.482 --> 09:35.275
Get in.

09:35.443 --> 09:38.278
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

09:38.446 --> 09:43.533
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

09:55.797 --> 09:58.341
Jimmy. Jimmy.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.594
Earth to Mr. Markum.

10:01.762 --> 10:05.348
- What do you want now, Pete?
- Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

10:05.515 --> 10:08.392
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.436
- So?
- So that means less profit...

10:10.604 --> 10:13.731
...and more profit means I get a raise.

10:13.899 --> 10:15.441
So why don't you order more.

10:15.609 --> 10:18.903
All right, but if the
Surgeon General calls, you're my alibi.

10:33.126 --> 10:35.836
- Hey, you.
- Hey, there.

10:36.004 --> 10:39.091
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

10:39.258 --> 10:43.220
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

10:44.472 --> 10:46.765
- Christ, I sound like...
- Someone's father?

10:46.933 --> 10:49.267
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

10:52.563 --> 10:54.773
- Later, Daddy.
- Later.

10:54.941 --> 10:56.650
Have fun.

11:01.197 --> 11:04.616
- Later.
- Later.

11:30.811 --> 11:32.770
Brendan.

11:33.439 --> 11:37.984
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

11:38.318 --> 11:42.822
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

11:45.451 --> 11:47.160
What will he do if he sees this?

11:48.454 --> 11:50.872
Shoot you and then kill you.

11:56.044 --> 11:57.712
It's been six hours.

11:58.046 --> 12:00.339
I had to see you.

12:02.718 --> 12:05.136
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

12:07.181 --> 12:09.223
Tomorrow?

12:09.391 --> 12:11.518
Like we planned?

12:12.812 --> 12:14.146
Tomorrow.

12:18.193 --> 12:20.402
Drop me around the corner.

12:51.893 --> 12:54.728
Take it easy.
He kept cutting me off!

12:54.896 --> 12:59.150
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

12:59.318 --> 13:03.404
He followed me all the way from
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

13:03.572 --> 13:04.948
That son of a bitch!

13:05.115 --> 13:08.409
Oh, can you believe this guy
keeps confessing?

13:08.577 --> 13:12.747
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a
lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

13:15.042 --> 13:16.584
Hey, Devine?

13:21.090 --> 13:24.384
- What you looking at?
- The old neighborhood.

13:27.596 --> 13:31.599
We're done, but I can stay.
- No, I think we're good, thanks.

13:31.809 --> 13:36.396
Um, a few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.526
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

13:41.694 --> 13:43.903
Yeah.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.784
- So the wife left you six months ago?
- So?

13:48.952 --> 13:52.246
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs...

13:52.414 --> 13:55.374
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

13:55.542 --> 13:56.959
So, what's your point?

13:57.127 --> 14:00.837
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

14:01.088 --> 14:03.506
She wants to worship
at the temple of Sean Devine.

14:03.674 --> 14:06.801
I'm married, Whitey.
- So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

14:06.969 --> 14:09.554
You haven't talked to Lauren
in six months.

14:09.722 --> 14:11.180
She calls all the time.

14:11.348 --> 14:14.475
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

14:14.643 --> 14:18.521
One of these days, the phone's gonna
ring and she'll tell me why she left.

14:18.689 --> 14:21.983
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

14:41.713 --> 14:44.048
Come on, come on, come on.

14:45.133 --> 14:48.802
The pitch. A swing and
a line drive into right field. A base hit.

14:48.970 --> 14:52.014
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.942
Could we please have three beers?

15:09.407 --> 15:11.825
Yeah, come on.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.801
You believe those chicks?

15:30.221 --> 15:33.306
Come on.
Oh, yeah, baby.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.601
Hey.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.104
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.816
- We've got you right over here, boys.
Yeah.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.776
Yeah.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.738
I've known her since she was a kid.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.084
A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.637
Dave.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.724
It's 3 in the morning.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.142
Where have you been?

16:19.271 --> 16:20.938
Oh, my God.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.649
I fucked up.

16:24.276 --> 16:25.776
What happened?

16:26.528 --> 16:30.781
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.744
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.289
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

16:38.457 --> 16:42.293
- It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God, Dave.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.755
Come on. Come here.

16:47.132 --> 16:52.053
So I'm walking to my car, and this
guy comes up to me, he asks for a light.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.432
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.186
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

16:59.353 --> 17:01.813
- Oh, God.
- That's when I see the knife.

17:01.981 --> 17:05.108
Says, "Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them. "

17:05.276 --> 17:06.818
- That's what he said?
- Yeah.

17:06.986 --> 17:10.321
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

17:10.490 --> 17:15.285
- You said you swung on him first.
- Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

17:15.828 --> 17:18.204
I'm sorry, babe.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.707
Shh.

17:21.751 --> 17:24.586
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I...

17:27.006 --> 17:28.673
I went off.

17:30.176 --> 17:32.344
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

17:33.304 --> 17:36.014
There was blood everywhere.

17:38.518 --> 17:40.478
I might have killed him.

17:42.189 --> 17:44.357
Killed him?

17:52.324 --> 17:54.700
It makes you feel...

17:54.868 --> 17:57.245
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

17:58.580 --> 18:02.166
Yeah, but you had to, right?

18:02.960 --> 18:05.211
It makes you feel...

18:06.380 --> 18:07.880
...alien.

18:15.305 --> 18:17.348
Okay.

18:18.058 --> 18:20.351
Babe, you hop in the shower.

18:20.519 --> 18:24.105
And I'll take care of your clothes.

18:25.440 --> 18:28.443
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:28.611 --> 18:30.445
Here.

18:42.292 --> 18:45.752
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

18:45.920 --> 18:49.423
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

18:49.591 --> 18:52.342
What's the location of the car?
Sydney Street.

18:52.510 --> 18:56.430
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.

18:56.598 --> 18:59.266
Son, what's your name?
He wants to know her name.

18:59.434 --> 19:00.976
Your name, what's your name?

19:01.144 --> 19:03.770
We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.202
Dispatch, this is Unit 33.

19:18.369 --> 19:23.457
We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.

19:23.625 --> 19:27.502
Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.

19:27.670 --> 19:31.632
No, but by the looks
of this car, we'll find one sooner or later.

19:44.729 --> 19:47.231
- Yeah?
I'm in the weeds at the store...

19:47.398 --> 19:48.774
...and I need some help.

19:48.942 --> 19:52.694
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

19:52.904 --> 19:56.531
- That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
- Hold on.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.585
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

20:07.753 --> 20:11.506
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

20:11.757 --> 20:14.342
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

20:14.510 --> 20:15.885
She'll be there.

20:16.178 --> 20:18.680
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

20:18.847 --> 20:22.058
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

20:22.226 --> 20:24.394
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

20:24.937 --> 20:28.523
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

20:28.691 --> 20:30.692
What the fuck's going on here?

20:39.451 --> 20:43.204
Pete, anybody show?
- No.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.373
Katie didn't call?

20:45.541 --> 20:47.292
No.

20:57.929 --> 20:59.930
Hello?
- Drew, Jimmy.

21:00.098 --> 21:02.224
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

21:02.809 --> 21:06.353
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

21:10.275 --> 21:11.567
Have a nice day.

21:11.735 --> 21:14.820
No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.

21:14.988 --> 21:19.033
Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.909
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

21:21.077 --> 21:24.913
- She seeing anybody maybe?
- 19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

21:25.081 --> 21:28.292
- That's the cold truth, bud.
- I'll talk to you later.

21:36.260 --> 21:38.428
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

21:38.596 --> 21:41.306
- Mind if I go grab a smoke?
- You can smoke the whole pack.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.016
Thanks.

21:55.321 --> 21:57.113
Can I help you, Brendan?

21:58.074 --> 22:01.534
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

22:01.702 --> 22:04.996
- That's Barry's. Next aisle.
Thanks.

22:18.969 --> 22:21.514
When's Sal getting here?
Anytime now.

22:21.681 --> 22:24.642
- That it, Bren?
- A Globe.

22:26.228 --> 22:28.771
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

22:29.231 --> 22:31.982
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

22:32.651 --> 22:35.069
No, I just see her here sometimes.

22:35.237 --> 22:38.030
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

22:38.198 --> 22:39.365
Oh.

22:39.533 --> 22:41.951
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

22:54.756 --> 22:56.549
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

22:57.342 --> 22:59.176
Shoot.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.512
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

23:02.013 --> 23:06.016
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

23:06.810 --> 23:09.354
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

23:09.522 --> 23:13.608
He's nice. Does sign language with his
brother even though he doesn't have to.

23:13.776 --> 23:15.694
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

23:15.862 --> 23:19.030
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

23:19.198 --> 23:21.867
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

23:22.285 --> 23:25.245
- No. Really?
- Straight up.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.877
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.727
Hey, there, bad boy.
- Sarge.

23:48.895 --> 23:53.648
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

23:53.816 --> 23:56.194
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

23:58.739 --> 24:01.240
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

24:01.408 --> 24:02.700
Let's go find out.

24:02.868 --> 24:05.286
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER
on his own...

24:05.454 --> 24:07.830
...steak knife sticking out
of his collarbone.

24:07.998 --> 24:11.250
He asks the nurse, "Hey, where they
keep the Coke machine?"

24:11.418 --> 24:14.795
- Did she tell him?
What do we got on the car so far?

24:14.963 --> 24:18.633
We found the registration in the
glove box. Owner is Katherine Markum.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.343
- Oh, shit.
- You know her?

24:20.511 --> 24:23.095
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

24:23.263 --> 24:26.974
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

24:27.142 --> 24:31.103
- Oh, fuck, that's her.
- Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

24:31.271 --> 24:35.607
When we were kids. Now it's just
a "hello" around the neighborhood.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.611
Nineteen.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.571
Fuck, man.

24:41.739 --> 24:44.325
He's in for a world of hurt.

25:11.144 --> 25:14.105
Do not make her laugh.

25:21.822 --> 25:24.240
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

25:24.408 --> 25:28.703
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

25:28.870 --> 25:33.166
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

25:33.334 --> 25:35.377
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

25:35.545 --> 25:38.505
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

25:38.673 --> 25:41.675
...hits her in the shoulder,
maybe the bicep.

25:41.843 --> 25:45.053
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds...

25:46.681 --> 25:49.933
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I dig that.

25:50.852 --> 25:53.145
Body of Christ.

25:54.188 --> 25:56.481
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

25:57.734 --> 26:00.777
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

26:05.366 --> 26:07.534
Body of Christ.

26:08.536 --> 26:14.207
Body of Christ.

26:16.545 --> 26:19.297
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

26:19.465 --> 26:20.923
The killer shows, she bolts.

26:21.091 --> 26:24.677
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

26:24.845 --> 26:28.097
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

26:35.356 --> 26:37.231
Body of Christ.

26:39.485 --> 26:41.653
Body of Christ.

26:51.872 --> 26:55.208
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

26:55.376 --> 26:59.420
No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

27:00.047 --> 27:02.256
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

27:02.591 --> 27:06.387
Daddy, Daddy!
Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

27:06.554 --> 27:08.097
This dress itches.

27:08.264 --> 27:11.934
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

27:12.102 --> 27:14.436
We are so proud of you.

27:33.623 --> 27:35.791
- Morning, honey.
- Dave.

27:35.959 --> 27:40.129
There's nothing about it in the papers.
I checked three times.

27:40.296 --> 27:43.465
It was late, real late.

27:45.427 --> 27:47.845
- Morning, Mikey.
Morning, Dad.

27:48.722 --> 27:52.642
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

27:54.103 --> 27:55.979
Come on.

27:58.774 --> 28:00.984
Put your coat on, Mike.

28:01.152 --> 28:03.278
Thanks, Mom.

28:14.665 --> 28:16.958
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

28:17.126 --> 28:19.836
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

28:20.004 --> 28:24.215
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

28:24.383 --> 28:27.177
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

28:27.344 --> 28:29.888
Just curious, I guess.

28:41.234 --> 28:48.491
That's my daughter's car.

28:51.495 --> 28:54.079
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

28:54.247 --> 28:55.998
- Want to take a walk over?
Yeah.

28:56.166 --> 28:58.334
Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.

28:58.502 --> 29:00.836
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

29:01.004 --> 29:02.463
Oh, shit.

29:02.631 --> 29:05.174
- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.

29:05.342 --> 29:08.219
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

29:08.386 --> 29:11.889
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

29:12.057 --> 29:13.808
And he's got some guys with him.

29:13.975 --> 29:17.269
- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.

29:17.437 --> 29:21.941
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

29:22.108 --> 29:23.943
All right, I'm on my way.

29:28.074 --> 29:30.408
Hey, guys.
That's our niece in there.

29:30.576 --> 29:32.244
Let us in.
We're doing our job.

29:32.411 --> 29:33.703
Let us in.
Fuck you!

29:33.871 --> 29:35.580
The doughnut shop's that way!

29:35.748 --> 29:38.542
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

29:38.709 --> 29:40.752
- Enough.
- Nick.

29:40.920 --> 29:45.090
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.843
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

29:49.052 --> 29:51.637
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

29:51.805 --> 29:53.931
- But get answers.
- You got it.

29:58.270 --> 30:01.313
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

30:02.941 --> 30:05.484
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

30:05.652 --> 30:08.279
- Is she in there?
All we're doing is looking.

30:08.446 --> 30:12.075
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

30:12.285 --> 30:15.328
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

30:15.496 --> 30:19.791
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

30:19.959 --> 30:24.629
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

30:24.797 --> 30:27.048
Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.

30:27.216 --> 30:30.176
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.

30:30.344 --> 30:34.139
- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

30:34.307 --> 30:36.141
All right.

30:36.309 --> 30:38.310
Make sure he doesn't get through.

30:38.853 --> 30:40.937
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

30:41.105 --> 30:45.066
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.027
Go.

30:50.823 --> 30:54.910
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.746
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...

30:57.914 --> 31:00.833
...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

31:01.251 --> 31:05.338
Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...

31:05.505 --> 31:08.841
...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

31:09.009 --> 31:12.303
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

31:12.512 --> 31:17.850
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

31:18.435 --> 31:20.728
Ready? Bat back.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.608
All the way back.

31:36.453 --> 31:39.330
I never saw anything like that before.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.874
What do we got?

31:51.427 --> 31:53.553
Oh, Christ.

32:12.782 --> 32:14.533
Is that her?

32:17.537 --> 32:18.787
Yeah.

32:19.956 --> 32:23.041
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.627
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

32:25.795 --> 32:28.672
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

32:28.840 --> 32:33.261
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a. 38.

32:34.596 --> 32:36.931
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

32:37.099 --> 32:39.142
"Hey, Jimmy...

32:39.309 --> 32:43.312
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect. "

32:46.942 --> 32:48.443
Hey.
Hold on!

32:48.610 --> 32:52.905
Grab him. Stop that guy.
Hey, you!

32:53.073 --> 32:55.324
I'm fucking going in there!
Take it easy!

32:55.492 --> 32:57.827
Get his arms.
Hold him. Come on.

32:57.995 --> 33:00.329
Let me in, you motherfuckers!
Take it easy.

33:01.415 --> 33:05.418
Let me in!
Is she in there?!

33:05.586 --> 33:10.465
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

33:10.632 --> 33:14.135
Is my daughter in there?!
Is she in there?! Is she in there?!

33:14.303 --> 33:16.512
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

33:16.680 --> 33:20.142
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

33:20.310 --> 33:23.312
Is that my daughter in there?!

33:23.480 --> 33:26.648
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

33:26.816 --> 33:31.361
Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

33:31.529 --> 33:34.323
Is that my daughter in there?

33:35.033 --> 33:37.868
No! No!

33:41.039 --> 33:43.165
Oh, no!

33:43.333 --> 33:45.834
No, God!

33:46.002 --> 33:49.421
Oh, God, no!

34:33.217 --> 34:35.885
No one's said anything, right?

34:36.053 --> 34:37.719
What do you mean?

34:37.888 --> 34:42.433
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

34:42.601 --> 34:44.561
Jimmy?

34:44.728 --> 34:46.353
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

34:46.522 --> 34:50.233
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

35:30.316 --> 35:32.859
Yeah, that's her.

35:34.445 --> 35:36.404
That's Katie.

35:37.698 --> 35:39.991
That's my daughter.

35:59.930 --> 36:02.097
Fresh-brewed.

36:02.265 --> 36:04.725
So we need to work a time line.

36:04.893 --> 36:07.228
It's details, little things
that make a case.

36:07.395 --> 36:11.148
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

36:12.484 --> 36:17.071
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

36:17.239 --> 36:20.157
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

36:20.325 --> 36:23.410
At the last minute,
she changed her mind.

36:24.996 --> 36:26.789
See what I mean?

36:27.333 --> 36:29.501
What do you mean, Jimmy?

36:31.462 --> 36:35.173
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

36:35.341 --> 36:37.217
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

36:37.385 --> 36:39.678
If I'd gotten into that car that day...

36:40.263 --> 36:42.681
...my life would have been
a different thing.

36:43.140 --> 36:46.685
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

36:47.478 --> 36:49.813
...she was a beautiful woman.

36:50.314 --> 36:52.232
Regal.

36:53.234 --> 36:55.652
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

36:55.820 --> 36:58.321
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

36:58.489 --> 37:02.659
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

37:03.744 --> 37:05.578
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

37:05.746 --> 37:08.540
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

37:08.708 --> 37:11.751
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

37:11.919 --> 37:15.089
And Katie never would have been born.

37:15.257 --> 37:18.384
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

37:20.429 --> 37:22.555
See?
- Yeah.

37:23.557 --> 37:28.686
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

37:31.773 --> 37:35.651
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

37:35.819 --> 37:37.320
Around 7:30.

37:37.487 --> 37:40.448
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

37:41.241 --> 37:47.246
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

37:47.414 --> 37:50.458
She was having dinner with her friends.

37:53.795 --> 37:56.922
Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

37:57.090 --> 38:00.926
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

38:01.094 --> 38:04.598
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

38:04.766 --> 38:07.142
And then around 8, she left.

38:07.310 --> 38:10.437
Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

38:10.605 --> 38:14.358
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

38:14.525 --> 38:16.777
- No, go ahead.
Good.

38:16.944 --> 38:21.323
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

38:22.075 --> 38:24.576
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

38:24.744 --> 38:27.788
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

38:27.955 --> 38:31.208
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

38:31.376 --> 38:33.168
She what?

38:34.754 --> 38:36.463
It's nothing.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.800
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

38:40.593 --> 38:44.054
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

38:44.222 --> 38:47.891
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.312
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

38:51.480 --> 38:55.691
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

38:55.859 --> 38:59.821
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

38:59.988 --> 39:02.657
Okay.
- It was just a look.

39:03.200 --> 39:08.037
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

39:08.205 --> 39:09.497
You were in prison?

39:09.665 --> 39:10.957
- Oh, Jesus.
Here we go.

39:11.125 --> 39:13.459
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

39:14.002 --> 39:17.839
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

39:18.006 --> 39:20.842
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

39:21.427 --> 39:24.846
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

39:25.431 --> 39:28.307
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

39:28.475 --> 39:30.768
Okay, Mr. Markum.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.439
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

39:35.608 --> 39:39.069
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

39:46.369 --> 39:48.454
There was this kid.

39:48.663 --> 39:51.081
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

39:51.249 --> 39:53.375
What? Remember, it's the little things.

39:53.918 --> 39:57.963
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

39:58.131 --> 40:00.924
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

40:01.092 --> 40:02.885
No.
- What makes you so sure?

40:03.052 --> 40:05.596
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

40:05.763 --> 40:08.557
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

40:08.933 --> 40:12.019
No one right now, as far as we know.

40:12.187 --> 40:15.272
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

40:15.440 --> 40:18.734
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

40:18.902 --> 40:23.530
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

40:24.574 --> 40:28.035
And if you think of anything...

40:28.203 --> 40:31.872
...anything at all, give us a call.

40:37.754 --> 40:40.172
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

40:40.340 --> 40:44.259
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

40:44.427 --> 40:46.303
This car came up and took Dave away.

40:46.471 --> 40:49.306
- Abduction?
- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

40:49.474 --> 40:53.727
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

40:53.895 --> 40:55.729
- They catch these guys?
- One died.

40:55.897 --> 40:58.774
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

40:58.942 --> 41:02.945
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

41:03.112 --> 41:06.281
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

41:06.449 --> 41:09.201
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

41:09.370 --> 41:13.748
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

41:18.837 --> 41:21.673
Cause of death: The gunshot wound
to the back of the head...

41:21.840 --> 41:23.800
...not the trauma from the beating.

41:23.968 --> 41:25.385
What else?

41:25.594 --> 41:28.137
Her and her friends were barhopping.

41:28.305 --> 41:31.349
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

41:31.517 --> 41:34.143
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

41:34.311 --> 41:37.313
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

41:37.481 --> 41:39.774
It doesn't sound like much.

41:39.942 --> 41:42.151
What do you say, Devine?

41:43.862 --> 41:45.572
We'll get the guy, sir.

41:45.990 --> 41:49.867
That's right. All right, let's do it.

41:54.665 --> 41:57.793
- That's the best you can come up with?
- It made him happy, didn't it?

42:00.839 --> 42:02.798
This is Sean.

42:03.592 --> 42:06.969
- Hello?
- Is it Lauren?

42:09.723 --> 42:12.558
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

42:15.020 --> 42:16.729
Is he with you?

42:23.278 --> 42:25.446
Is that the baby?

42:26.865 --> 42:28.991
Christ, Lauren, at least tell me her name.

42:38.835 --> 42:41.503
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

42:55.436 --> 42:57.062
Hey.

43:00.524 --> 43:02.859
Would it surprise you?

43:03.027 --> 43:04.944
Wouldn't be the first time.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.076
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that...?

43:11.243 --> 43:13.244
Did you see her?

43:13.704 --> 43:16.748
- I heard a car hit something.
- Hit what? Another car?

43:16.916 --> 43:19.793
- Oh, no, not loud like that.
- Like hitting the curb?

43:19.960 --> 43:21.836
Yes, maybe.

43:22.004 --> 43:24.964
Then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi. "

43:25.132 --> 43:27.258
- Someone said, "Hi"?
- "Hi. "

43:28.719 --> 43:30.930
Then there was a loud crack.

43:31.098 --> 43:34.809
- Could it have been a gunshot?
- Yes, maybe.

43:34.976 --> 43:38.354
- Did you look out your window?
Oh, no.

43:38.522 --> 43:41.482
I was in my dressing gown by then.

43:42.275 --> 43:45.111
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

43:45.278 --> 43:47.947
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

43:48.448 --> 43:50.574
Female.

43:50.742 --> 43:52.118
I think.

43:52.953 --> 43:56.038
- It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
- Yeah.

43:56.206 --> 43:58.457
Sorry to trouble you.

44:06.466 --> 44:08.926
- Jimmy.
- Theo.

44:09.094 --> 44:11.429
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

44:11.596 --> 44:13.597
- She's trying.
- Let's get these on ice.

44:13.765 --> 44:16.142
You got a couple of coolers?

44:22.108 --> 44:24.317
Right here's fine.

44:29.490 --> 44:32.868
So how are you handling all this so far?

44:33.035 --> 44:35.996
- It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
- Yeah?

44:36.164 --> 44:38.582
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

44:38.750 --> 44:42.502
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

44:42.670 --> 44:46.465
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

44:46.632 --> 44:50.343
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

44:52.430 --> 44:54.347
Domestic responsibilities?

44:54.515 --> 44:59.811
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

45:00.396 --> 45:02.981
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

45:03.149 --> 45:05.735
It just needed to be said, that's all.

45:06.862 --> 45:09.989
You'll come through
because you're a man.

45:10.157 --> 45:12.325
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

45:12.493 --> 45:15.745
I said, "You got yourself
a real old-school man there. "

45:15.913 --> 45:18.539
- Like they put her in a bag.
What?

45:18.707 --> 45:21.918
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

45:22.085 --> 45:26.047
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

45:27.299 --> 45:29.884
- Well...
- Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

45:30.052 --> 45:33.221
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

45:33.555 --> 45:38.266
- You don't need to talk about Janey.
- My daughter was murdered.

45:38.434 --> 45:42.103
They put a gun to her. As we
stand here, she's on an autopsy slab...

45:42.271 --> 45:45.065
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

45:45.233 --> 45:48.902
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

45:52.741 --> 45:54.951
Good to see you, Theo.

45:59.081 --> 46:02.583
Eve, just tell them what they
want to know.

46:02.751 --> 46:05.711
Who was she dating?
- We already told the Savages.

46:05.879 --> 46:08.631
The Savage brothers?
- They were here yesterday.

46:08.799 --> 46:12.176
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

46:12.344 --> 46:14.637
No one special.

46:18.016 --> 46:21.269
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

46:22.020 --> 46:24.397
- What?
- She was leaving town, wasn't she?

46:24.565 --> 46:27.942
- Going to Las Vegas?
- How do you know?

46:28.110 --> 46:32.947
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

46:33.949 --> 46:37.118
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

46:37.452 --> 46:40.789
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.834
So who was she going with?

46:44.002 --> 46:48.088
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

46:48.965 --> 46:50.257
Brendan.

46:50.592 --> 46:52.634
Excuse me?

46:52.802 --> 46:56.179
- Brendan.
- Brendan Harris?

46:56.639 --> 46:58.807
Brendan Harris, yeah.

46:59.017 --> 47:00.809
You got an address?

47:14.324 --> 47:16.283
Hey, Dave.

47:20.163 --> 47:22.080
Hey, Jimmy.

47:22.248 --> 47:25.710
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

47:26.545 --> 47:29.422
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

47:35.012 --> 47:38.014
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

47:38.849 --> 47:43.186
How you doing?

47:44.730 --> 47:46.606
What happened to your hand?

47:47.524 --> 47:49.108
This?

47:50.069 --> 47:54.364
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

47:55.532 --> 47:58.201
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

48:00.537 --> 48:02.205
It's good to see you.

48:02.998 --> 48:04.332
Yeah?

48:10.381 --> 48:12.549
How are our girls holding up?

48:12.717 --> 48:14.843
They're doing okay, I guess.

48:15.011 --> 48:18.347
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

48:30.110 --> 48:34.029
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

48:36.324 --> 48:37.616
Yeah.

48:42.580 --> 48:46.583
I couldn't stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food...

48:46.751 --> 48:49.712
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

48:50.005 --> 48:53.215
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

48:54.592 --> 48:58.846
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

48:59.432 --> 49:03.935
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

49:10.192 --> 49:13.611
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

49:14.822 --> 49:16.906
...that girl was neat.

49:20.244 --> 49:21.828
When I got out of the joint...

49:23.205 --> 49:26.124
...you know, after Marita died...

49:27.626 --> 49:32.630
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

49:33.799 --> 49:36.468
...than I ever was of being in prison.

49:44.935 --> 49:47.146
I loved her...

49:48.440 --> 49:50.357
...most...

49:53.028 --> 49:56.530
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

49:59.409 --> 50:05.539
...it was like we were the last two
people on Earth. You know, forgotten.

50:06.208 --> 50:08.334
Unwanted.

50:10.420 --> 50:14.799
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

50:14.966 --> 50:19.053
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

50:24.017 --> 50:25.810
Jimmy.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.816
You're crying now.

50:35.029 --> 50:37.197
Yeah, damn.

50:42.245 --> 50:45.205
I just want to hug her one more time.

50:48.918 --> 50:52.629
She was 19 fucking years old.

50:59.928 --> 51:01.887
Do you want me to leave you alone?

51:02.889 --> 51:05.432
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

51:06.601 --> 51:10.229
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

51:27.039 --> 51:29.875
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

51:30.168 --> 51:33.628
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

51:36.924 --> 51:40.594
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

51:42.805 --> 51:46.099
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

51:46.392 --> 51:48.393
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

51:49.103 --> 51:50.937
It was about 8. Um...

51:51.939 --> 51:56.943
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

51:57.278 --> 52:00.614
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

52:02.158 --> 52:03.825
I don't know.

52:04.744 --> 52:09.457
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

52:09.625 --> 52:13.544
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

52:13.712 --> 52:15.213
He's not a thief.

52:15.380 --> 52:18.007
He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

52:18.592 --> 52:22.345
Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

52:23.096 --> 52:27.642
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

52:29.311 --> 52:31.812
We were gonna leave Sunday.

52:33.023 --> 52:35.942
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

52:38.153 --> 52:40.529
Well, that was the plan, right?

52:40.822 --> 52:43.699
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

52:43.867 --> 52:46.994
- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

52:54.002 --> 52:58.173
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

52:58.341 --> 53:00.717
Hey, boys.
Hey.

53:00.969 --> 53:02.678
He don't speak.

53:02.845 --> 53:07.182
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

53:07.350 --> 53:11.478
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

53:12.772 --> 53:16.984
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a. m. On Sunday morning, Brendan?

53:17.819 --> 53:19.069
I was asleep.

53:19.237 --> 53:21.029
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

53:24.701 --> 53:27.995
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

53:28.162 --> 53:30.956
He came down for breakfast at 9.

53:31.791 --> 53:36.420
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

53:36.587 --> 53:40.757
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you're up for that?

53:43.429 --> 53:45.972
I loved her so much.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.768
I'm never gonna feel that again.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.730
It doesn't happen twice.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.192
Doesn't happen once most times.

53:59.737 --> 54:01.571
Celeste.

54:02.698 --> 54:06.743
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

54:07.077 --> 54:08.911
Uh...

54:09.580 --> 54:11.205
I don't know.

54:11.999 --> 54:15.001
I don't know, I just...

54:16.170 --> 54:18.046
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

54:18.380 --> 54:20.923
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

54:21.091 --> 54:24.093
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

54:29.267 --> 54:31.727
One for the road and then home.

54:36.107 --> 54:40.778
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.780
You've done enough.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.286
To you and Dave for being here for this.

55:06.471 --> 55:09.807
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

55:11.142 --> 55:14.061
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

55:14.229 --> 55:15.897
Good night.

55:16.857 --> 55:19.484
Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

55:39.171 --> 55:40.588
Hello?

55:43.175 --> 55:47.387
Oh, Christ. Lauren, say something.

55:53.561 --> 55:56.354
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

55:57.064 --> 56:00.817
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing
things made sense.

56:00.985 --> 56:03.237
I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...

56:03.405 --> 56:06.157
...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.

56:07.325 --> 56:11.786
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

56:11.954 --> 56:13.997
The dead are still dead.

56:16.625 --> 56:18.960
Jesus, I...

56:19.128 --> 56:21.254
...can't do this tonight.

56:21.547 --> 56:23.339
I just...

56:24.383 --> 56:26.176
I can't do it.

56:26.552 --> 56:28.344
Bye, baby.

56:39.023 --> 56:40.648
Because...

56:41.775 --> 56:45.278
...sometimes the man
wasn't a man at all.

56:45.488 --> 56:47.197
He was the boy.

56:48.115 --> 56:51.160
The boy who escaped from wolves.

56:52.245 --> 56:54.830
An animal of the dusk.

56:55.123 --> 56:56.999
Invisible.

56:57.417 --> 56:59.293
Silent.

56:59.878 --> 57:01.962
Living in a world...

57:02.130 --> 57:04.548
...the others never saw.

57:06.426 --> 57:08.928
World of fireflies.

57:10.514 --> 57:14.975
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

57:15.685 --> 57:20.105
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

57:31.660 --> 57:36.498
I just gotta get my head right.

57:39.460 --> 57:42.671
Catch a nice, long sleep.

57:43.130 --> 57:46.132
And the boy will go back to his forest.

57:48.219 --> 57:51.304
Back to his fireflies.

57:58.854 --> 58:00.313
Is he asleep?

58:21.919 --> 58:24.338
How's Jimmy and everybody?

58:25.424 --> 58:27.133
Okay.

58:27.426 --> 58:29.176
It's weird.

58:29.636 --> 58:33.556
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

58:33.724 --> 58:36.183
Dave? Dave.

58:39.438 --> 58:41.397
There's still nothing in the paper.

58:42.024 --> 58:45.985
About what?

58:48.697 --> 58:52.950
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

58:53.368 --> 58:55.995
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

58:59.041 --> 59:00.708
Yeah.

59:00.876 --> 59:02.418
Right.

59:04.755 --> 59:07.340
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

59:08.133 --> 59:10.719
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

59:11.888 --> 59:14.598
That seems more important right now.

59:43.753 --> 59:47.589
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

59:48.591 --> 59:51.093
But I don't know how.

01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:12.782
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:15.618
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.120
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

01:00:17.287 --> 01:00:21.290
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:24.127
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

01:00:24.294 --> 01:00:27.046
Considering the crime, maybe.

01:00:27.297 --> 01:00:28.631
Dave Boyle?

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:32.260
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.970
Could be.

01:00:34.138 --> 01:00:37.640
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:41.519
- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.408
Hey, Boyle!

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.536
- What's it been, seven, eight years?
- Yeah.

01:00:57.704 --> 01:00:59.204
Yeah. How you doing?

01:00:59.497 --> 01:01:00.831
This is my son, Michael.

01:01:00.999 --> 01:01:03.375
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:04.877
I'm an old buddy of your dad's.

01:01:05.044 --> 01:01:06.420
- Hi.
Hi.

01:01:07.088 --> 01:01:10.340
- So you still with the staties?
- Homicide. This is my partner.

01:01:10.508 --> 01:01:13.218
- Sergeant Powers. How are you?
So you got a minute?

01:01:13.386 --> 01:01:17.681
- We'd love to ask some quick questions.
- I was gonna walk Michael to school.

01:01:17.849 --> 01:01:21.769
- I can be back in a few minutes.
We'll walk with you, okay?

01:01:21.936 --> 01:01:23.437
Sure.

01:01:25.023 --> 01:01:26.814
So you look good.

01:01:27.357 --> 01:01:30.359
- I hear rents are rising.
Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

01:01:30.527 --> 01:01:33.155
They're cutting my dad's
old house up into condos.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:35.115
We walked by there the other day.

01:01:35.283 --> 01:01:37.534
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

01:01:37.702 --> 01:01:40.120
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

01:01:40.288 --> 01:01:42.414
"Neighborhood needs
a fucking crime wave.

01:01:42.582 --> 01:01:44.750
Get property values where they belong. "

01:01:44.918 --> 01:01:49.421
Girls keep getting murdered up in
Pen Park you might get your wish.

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:52.090
Dave. Call me Dave.

01:01:52.258 --> 01:01:54.218
You said the F-word, Dad.

01:01:54.594 --> 01:01:57.387
Yeah, I know.
Walk on up ahead, Michael.

01:01:57.555 --> 01:02:00.724
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

01:02:00.892 --> 01:02:04.895
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

01:02:05.063 --> 01:02:07.981
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

01:02:08.149 --> 01:02:10.275
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

01:02:10.443 --> 01:02:14.696
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:18.243
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:23.456
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

01:02:23.624 --> 01:02:25.625
That's what we wanted to talk about.

01:02:25.793 --> 01:02:29.754
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

01:02:29.922 --> 01:02:32.215
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

01:02:32.383 --> 01:02:35.927
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

01:02:36.095 --> 01:02:39.138
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

01:02:39.306 --> 01:02:40.890
What time did they leave?

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:44.102
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:47.397
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.067
You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:52.902
Michael.

01:02:53.404 --> 01:02:55.113
Like what?
I don't know.

01:02:55.281 --> 01:02:56.614
A guy watching the girls?

01:02:56.782 --> 01:02:59.617
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

01:03:00.953 --> 01:03:05.624
No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

01:03:05.792 --> 01:03:07.167
See you later, Dad.

01:03:07.335 --> 01:03:09.128
You got your milk money?

01:03:16.136 --> 01:03:18.137
Fuck, I hated school.

01:03:18.638 --> 01:03:20.180
What?

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:21.432
Oh, uh...

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.685
Yeah, me too, Sean.

01:03:24.895 --> 01:03:30.357
Uh, just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

01:03:30.525 --> 01:03:33.652
- Home.
- Home by 1: 15, would you say?

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.614
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

01:03:38.325 --> 01:03:41.368
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

01:03:41.828 --> 01:03:44.997
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
All right.

01:03:51.671 --> 01:03:53.256
What?

01:03:53.633 --> 01:03:56.009
What happened to him in that car?

01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:05.185
Can you believe this?

01:04:05.353 --> 01:04:08.355
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

01:04:08.522 --> 01:04:10.315
Yeah, well...

01:04:10.942 --> 01:04:14.402
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:16.488
...you're not left with a whole lot.

01:04:16.656 --> 01:04:19.240
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

01:04:19.408 --> 01:04:23.620
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

01:04:23.788 --> 01:04:25.747
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

01:04:25.915 --> 01:04:29.167
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

01:04:29.335 --> 01:04:33.964
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:38.009
- She says, "Hi. " He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

01:04:38.177 --> 01:04:40.846
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:43.641
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

01:04:43.809 --> 01:04:47.061
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

01:04:47.229 --> 01:04:51.524
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

01:04:51.692 --> 01:04:55.236
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

01:04:55.404 --> 01:04:58.614
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second, how
did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

01:04:58.782 --> 01:05:01.492
We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.495
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

01:05:04.663 --> 01:05:06.789
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

01:05:06.957 --> 01:05:10.626
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

01:05:10.794 --> 01:05:12.962
Just a little one.

01:05:17.968 --> 01:05:22.221
I'd recommend two sets of
visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

01:05:22.389 --> 01:05:24.557
- Sure.
- Good.

01:05:26.102 --> 01:05:30.897
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

01:05:31.232 --> 01:05:32.566
Good.

01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:39.865
And the notice?

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.075
Notice?

01:05:43.453 --> 01:05:48.331
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

01:05:48.499 --> 01:05:51.084
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

01:05:51.252 --> 01:05:52.961
Where's my daughter?

01:05:55.465 --> 01:05:57.507
Downstairs, in the basement.

01:05:58.342 --> 01:05:59.634
I wanna see her.

01:06:47.016 --> 01:06:49.351
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:53.855
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

01:06:54.232 --> 01:06:56.858
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

01:07:00.781 --> 01:07:03.366
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:08.746
The notice.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.416
It should read: "Katherine Markum...

01:07:14.086 --> 01:07:17.588
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.593
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to... "

01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:26.389
"Sister to Sara and Nadine. "

01:08:06.764 --> 01:08:10.809
You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

01:08:11.769 --> 01:08:14.062
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:16.982
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:20.152
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.946
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.

01:08:23.156 --> 01:08:24.948
I'm gonna go get some.
See you in a minute.

01:08:25.116 --> 01:08:28.952
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

01:08:29.578 --> 01:08:35.417
Uh, garbage disposal. It jammed,
I stuck my hand in, it started again.

01:08:35.586 --> 01:08:37.295
- Stupid.
Yeah, painful.

01:08:41.634 --> 01:08:43.968
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

01:08:44.136 --> 01:08:48.139
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:04.781
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

01:09:06.158 --> 01:09:10.495
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

01:09:12.206 --> 01:09:14.207
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.549
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

01:09:22.716 --> 01:09:25.386
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

01:09:25.553 --> 01:09:26.720
Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

01:09:26.888 --> 01:09:28.346
Uh, yeah.

01:09:28.515 --> 01:09:31.934
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

01:09:32.102 --> 01:09:35.145
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

01:09:35.313 --> 01:09:36.814
Look, I gotta go.

01:09:39.693 --> 01:09:41.484
- Oh, damn it.
What?

01:09:41.653 --> 01:09:43.404
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

01:09:43.571 --> 01:09:46.156
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

01:09:46.992 --> 01:09:48.450
Come on.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.042
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

01:09:57.585 --> 01:10:00.004
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:01.797
- What?
- It's a little thing.

01:10:01.965 --> 01:10:05.718
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

01:10:05.885 --> 01:10:07.928
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

01:10:09.515 --> 01:10:11.683
You think Dave killed Katie?

01:10:12.143 --> 01:10:15.395
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

01:10:17.815 --> 01:10:21.234
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

01:10:21.402 --> 01:10:24.988
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

01:10:25.156 --> 01:10:28.325
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

01:10:28.492 --> 01:10:31.953
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

01:10:32.413 --> 01:10:35.457
I was asleep.

01:10:36.584 --> 01:10:41.796
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

01:10:41.964 --> 01:10:44.299
Okay. Well, thanks.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.771
Bullshit.

01:10:56.938 --> 01:10:58.439
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

01:10:58.607 --> 01:11:02.276
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

01:11:02.444 --> 01:11:04.153
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

01:11:04.696 --> 01:11:05.946
Remember what you said?

01:11:06.448 --> 01:11:10.951
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

01:11:12.579 --> 01:11:16.415
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:18.167
You're 100 percent sure?

01:11:18.835 --> 01:11:23.130
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

01:11:26.134 --> 01:11:29.053
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:31.639
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

01:11:31.807 --> 01:11:35.476
He said Katie told him you'd disown
her if she ever dated a Harris.

01:11:37.145 --> 01:11:40.314
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

01:11:40.482 --> 01:11:41.816
Why is that?

01:11:43.861 --> 01:11:46.488
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

01:11:46.656 --> 01:11:50.826
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

01:11:51.828 --> 01:11:54.996
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray. "

01:11:55.164 --> 01:11:57.999
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

01:11:58.835 --> 01:12:03.671
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

01:12:04.089 --> 01:12:05.840
I don't know.

01:12:06.174 --> 01:12:09.009
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

01:12:09.302 --> 01:12:14.348
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

01:12:16.518 --> 01:12:19.311
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:22.022
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:24.358
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

01:12:24.526 --> 01:12:28.529
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

01:12:28.697 --> 01:12:32.200
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

01:12:32.368 --> 01:12:35.662
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:39.583
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.252
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

01:12:43.004 --> 01:12:45.422
- How long?
- How long what?

01:12:45.756 --> 01:12:48.216
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

01:12:48.384 --> 01:12:49.718
You bargaining with us?

01:12:51.554 --> 01:12:52.846
Bargaining?

01:12:54.557 --> 01:12:56.391
You giving us a deadline?

01:12:59.395 --> 01:13:03.231
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

01:13:04.484 --> 01:13:08.987
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

01:13:12.783 --> 01:13:16.746
The last thing we need is Markum and
the Savages putting the fear of God...

01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:19.957
...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of those brothers.

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:23.753
Eleven months apart, like their mother
ran a loose-cannon factory.

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:26.380
Fucking knuckleheads.

01:13:29.426 --> 01:13:31.511
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

01:13:31.678 --> 01:13:35.056
- Yeah, you got a match?
- Mm-hm. You're gonna love it.

01:13:36.225 --> 01:13:39.602
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a. 38 Smith.

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:44.065
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

01:13:44.233 --> 01:13:49.362
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:50.905
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

01:13:51.073 --> 01:13:55.701
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:59.956
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

01:14:00.123 --> 01:14:03.752
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.088
Thought you'd like that.

01:14:35.785 --> 01:14:37.703
It's okay, Ray.

01:14:38.496 --> 01:14:40.330
Don't worry about it.

01:14:54.346 --> 01:14:55.680
Ma said that?

01:14:58.267 --> 01:14:59.517
That I'm better off?

01:15:05.399 --> 01:15:08.359
I loved her! You know what that's like?

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.035
I'm sorry.

01:15:25.127 --> 01:15:26.961
No, you're wrong.

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:30.381
I won't ever feel that again.

01:15:31.175 --> 01:15:36.346
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

01:15:36.513 --> 01:15:40.392
Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.103
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

01:15:43.313 --> 01:15:47.149
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

01:15:49.486 --> 01:15:52.029
That's the storeroom.

01:15:53.031 --> 01:15:56.742
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

01:15:57.035 --> 01:15:59.244
I always keep that door locked.

01:15:59.954 --> 01:16:02.915
So they must have had a key.

01:16:03.083 --> 01:16:07.086
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

01:16:07.253 --> 01:16:11.548
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

01:16:11.716 --> 01:16:16.428
The only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known...

01:16:16.846 --> 01:16:18.597
...I kept this under the counter.

01:16:18.765 --> 01:16:22.393
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

01:16:23.311 --> 01:16:25.855
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

01:16:26.023 --> 01:16:28.608
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

01:16:28.776 --> 01:16:31.861
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

01:16:32.029 --> 01:16:36.950
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

01:16:37.118 --> 01:16:38.618
Oh, yeah?

01:16:38.786 --> 01:16:41.496
- This guy I fired a couple of weeks before.
Mm-hm.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:45.583
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

01:16:45.751 --> 01:16:49.963
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

01:16:50.131 --> 01:16:52.215
And I just knew.

01:16:52.383 --> 01:16:55.135
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

01:16:55.803 --> 01:16:57.637
You remember his name?

01:16:58.639 --> 01:17:00.598
Do I look senile to you?

01:17:00.975 --> 01:17:03.268
- No, sir.
- Name...

01:17:03.477 --> 01:17:05.478
...was Ray Harris.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:08.898
We used to call him "Just Ray. "

01:17:11.653 --> 01:17:14.697
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:19.409
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

01:17:31.338 --> 01:17:33.214
Where you been?

01:17:34.508 --> 01:17:36.217
Out.

01:17:39.472 --> 01:17:41.473
What you watching?

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.725
Some vampire movie.

01:17:44.435 --> 01:17:47.020
Guy just got his head torn off.

01:17:48.773 --> 01:17:50.940
Where'd you go, Celeste?

01:17:55.279 --> 01:17:57.530
I was sitting in my car...

01:17:57.991 --> 01:18:01.160
...down by the channel.
You know...

01:18:01.787 --> 01:18:03.204
...thinking about things.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.417
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

01:18:08.835 --> 01:18:11.837
No, actually, I don't know.

01:18:17.552 --> 01:18:20.888
Things. You know, the day.

01:18:22.516 --> 01:18:25.351
About Katie being dead.

01:18:25.936 --> 01:18:28.771
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

01:18:29.481 --> 01:18:31.357
...those things.

01:18:31.733 --> 01:18:33.734
Those things.

01:18:34.528 --> 01:18:36.946
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

01:18:38.573 --> 01:18:40.115
Vampires.

01:18:41.827 --> 01:18:43.077
What about them?

01:18:44.956 --> 01:18:48.083
They're undead...

01:18:48.251 --> 01:18:51.336
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

01:18:51.504 --> 01:18:55.048
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

01:18:55.216 --> 01:18:57.092
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

01:18:58.511 --> 01:19:00.762
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

01:19:01.097 --> 01:19:03.473
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

01:19:03.641 --> 01:19:05.767
You're not making any sense.

01:19:08.813 --> 01:19:10.564
You think I killed Katie?

01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:12.858
- Celeste.
- What...?

01:19:13.067 --> 01:19:17.279
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

01:19:17.446 --> 01:19:20.824
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

01:19:20.992 --> 01:19:22.742
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:24.661
- Dave!
- What?

01:19:24.829 --> 01:19:29.583
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:31.543
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

01:19:31.711 --> 01:19:33.796
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

01:19:33.964 --> 01:19:38.634
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

01:19:39.303 --> 01:19:42.597
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

01:19:43.599 --> 01:19:46.726
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

01:19:46.894 --> 01:19:49.812
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.607
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

01:19:52.774 --> 01:19:55.985
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

01:19:56.153 --> 01:19:57.820
I must have killed her, right?

01:19:58.238 --> 01:19:59.947
Fuck!

01:20:27.727 --> 01:20:29.227
Henry...

01:20:29.854 --> 01:20:32.356
What? Henry?

01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:37.110
Henry and George.

01:20:40.823 --> 01:20:43.033
I never told anyone that before.

01:20:44.911 --> 01:20:46.370
Those were their names.

01:20:47.956 --> 01:20:50.540
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

01:20:53.711 --> 01:20:56.713
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

01:20:57.882 --> 01:21:01.426
...they were wolves, and Dave...

01:21:02.095 --> 01:21:06.140
...was the boy who escaped
from wolves.

01:21:08.352 --> 01:21:10.520
What are you talking about, Dave?

01:21:11.063 --> 01:21:13.439
I'm talking Henry and George.

01:21:14.441 --> 01:21:17.235
They took me on a four-day ride.

01:21:17.945 --> 01:21:23.282
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:27.036
And, man, Celeste...

01:21:27.246 --> 01:21:28.955
...did they have their fun.

01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:34.293
And no one came to help old Dave then.

01:21:36.296 --> 01:21:41.092
Dave had to pretend to be
somebody else.

01:21:46.098 --> 01:21:48.725
You mean, all those years ago...

01:21:51.603 --> 01:21:54.023
...when you were a little boy?

01:21:55.692 --> 01:21:57.317
Dave...

01:21:57.485 --> 01:21:59.570
Dave's dead.

01:22:00.947 --> 01:22:05.075
I don't know who came out of that
cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

01:22:06.453 --> 01:22:07.870
You see, honey...

01:22:08.038 --> 01:22:09.538
Fuck!

01:22:09.789 --> 01:22:12.416
It's like vampires.

01:22:15.462 --> 01:22:17.463
Once it's in you...

01:22:18.882 --> 01:22:20.799
...it stays.

01:22:22.177 --> 01:22:24.219
What stays?

01:22:30.894 --> 01:22:34.103
Did you know there were
child prostitutes in Rome Basin?

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.439
What?

01:22:42.238 --> 01:22:43.739
Fuck!

01:22:46.993 --> 01:22:49.995
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:52.164
I'm warning you...

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.834
...I can't trust my mind.

01:22:58.797 --> 01:23:02.216
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

01:23:04.552 --> 01:23:13.977
Okay.

01:23:15.688 --> 01:23:19.566
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

01:23:19.734 --> 01:23:22.319
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

01:23:22.487 --> 01:23:24.279
These things get passed around.

01:23:24.447 --> 01:23:27.408
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

01:23:27.576 --> 01:23:30.495
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

01:23:30.663 --> 01:23:34.749
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

01:23:34.917 --> 01:23:39.379
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:43.716
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

01:23:43.884 --> 01:23:48.054
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

01:23:48.222 --> 01:23:50.557
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

01:23:50.724 --> 01:23:54.102
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:58.273
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.732
Hey, he's not my friend.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.404
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

01:24:19.004 --> 01:24:20.629
Hey, Jimmy.

01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:23.424
You're out late.

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:25.301
Yeah, you too.

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.554
It's cold, huh?

01:24:28.805 --> 01:24:31.056
Yeah, I guess.

01:24:38.523 --> 01:24:40.107
You know, I...

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:42.651
I been sitting out here...

01:24:42.819 --> 01:24:44.945
...over the last few years...

01:24:46.865 --> 01:24:50.951
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:56.957
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while. "

01:25:01.505 --> 01:25:03.340
Weird thing is...

01:25:04.217 --> 01:25:06.301
...it seemed to bring her back.

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:12.849
I saw her, you know.

01:25:14.685 --> 01:25:16.353
Saw who?

01:25:16.604 --> 01:25:19.689
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

01:25:21.692 --> 01:25:25.820
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

01:25:28.824 --> 01:25:30.492
Did you talk to her?

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:33.828
Just nodded hello at one point.

01:25:34.664 --> 01:25:37.165
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

01:25:43.381 --> 01:25:44.881
But, uh...

01:25:45.049 --> 01:25:46.633
...Jimmy...

01:25:48.095 --> 01:25:50.012
...she looked, um...

01:25:51.348 --> 01:25:52.848
...happy.

01:26:08.991 --> 01:26:13.035
Uh, I got more walking to do.
Good night.

01:26:24.923 --> 01:26:28.175
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

01:26:28.343 --> 01:26:32.179
From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

01:26:32.347 --> 01:26:33.848
...adjacent to the parkway.

01:26:34.016 --> 01:26:38.562
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:42.316
...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

01:26:42.483 --> 01:26:47.404
After I left last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

01:26:47.572 --> 01:26:52.367
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

01:26:52.535 --> 01:26:55.245
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

01:26:55.413 --> 01:26:59.249
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

01:26:59.417 --> 01:27:02.252
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.172
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.091
She was chased through the park
where she died.

01:27:08.259 --> 01:27:12.095
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

01:27:12.263 --> 01:27:17.142
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:21.438
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

01:27:21.606 --> 01:27:23.107
Bingo.

01:27:23.776 --> 01:27:26.444
So, you wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

01:27:26.779 --> 01:27:29.781
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

01:27:29.948 --> 01:27:33.076
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:36.120
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

01:27:36.288 --> 01:27:39.499
We know you didn't get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:44.921
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

01:27:45.464 --> 01:27:47.964
She know what really happened
to your hand?

01:27:54.263 --> 01:27:57.140
How about a Sprite or something?

01:27:57.308 --> 01:28:01.353
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

01:28:01.521 --> 01:28:03.063
You lied.

01:28:03.231 --> 01:28:05.774
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

01:28:05.942 --> 01:28:10.822
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

01:28:10.989 --> 01:28:15.451
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

01:28:15.619 --> 01:28:17.203
Okay.

01:28:18.705 --> 01:28:20.373
All right.

01:28:20.833 --> 01:28:24.001
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

01:28:24.169 --> 01:28:26.838
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

01:28:28.757 --> 01:28:30.758
What are you looking at him for?

01:28:32.219 --> 01:28:35.888
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

01:28:36.682 --> 01:28:38.182
Sure.

01:28:38.475 --> 01:28:40.476
Oh, I get it.

01:28:41.103 --> 01:28:42.937
You're the good cop.

01:28:43.439 --> 01:28:46.482
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

01:28:46.692 --> 01:28:49.861
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

01:28:50.988 --> 01:28:54.240
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

01:28:56.411 --> 01:28:59.913
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:05.794
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

01:29:05.962 --> 01:29:09.173
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

01:29:09.799 --> 01:29:13.969
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

01:29:14.137 --> 01:29:16.805
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

01:29:16.973 --> 01:29:20.184
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

01:29:20.351 --> 01:29:22.144
Bled like hell.

01:29:22.562 --> 01:29:25.814
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

01:29:26.399 --> 01:29:29.568
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

01:29:29.736 --> 01:29:31.445
What blood type are you?

01:29:32.113 --> 01:29:33.780
B- negative.

01:29:34.032 --> 01:29:36.742
Yeah? That's the match we got.

01:29:37.327 --> 01:29:39.411
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

01:29:39.579 --> 01:29:42.080
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

01:29:43.417 --> 01:29:46.252
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:50.089
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

01:29:50.257 --> 01:29:53.426
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go.

01:29:53.594 --> 01:29:55.303
How will that look in court?

01:29:55.471 --> 01:29:59.390
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

01:29:59.558 --> 01:30:02.477
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

01:30:02.978 --> 01:30:04.771
What report?

01:30:05.147 --> 01:30:09.442
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

01:30:09.777 --> 01:30:12.862
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:15.615
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

01:30:21.622 --> 01:30:25.124
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

01:30:25.376 --> 01:30:28.920
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

01:30:29.088 --> 01:30:31.757
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

01:30:31.925 --> 01:30:34.510
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

01:30:34.678 --> 01:30:36.845
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

01:30:37.013 --> 01:30:39.306
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

01:30:39.474 --> 01:30:43.477
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

01:30:43.812 --> 01:30:46.146
Okay. Maybe.

01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:50.317
So, what do we do with Dave?

01:30:51.987 --> 01:30:53.529
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

01:30:54.406 --> 01:30:58.325
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

01:30:58.535 --> 01:31:01.829
Or this lovely red marble here.

01:31:02.664 --> 01:31:04.498
Or a figural.

01:31:04.666 --> 01:31:06.250
That one.

01:31:06.751 --> 01:31:10.254
Very good. Nice and simple.

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:20.348
Hey, Jimmy!

01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:25.937
Annabeth said you were here.

01:31:27.273 --> 01:31:29.399
We been asking around, like you said to.

01:31:29.567 --> 01:31:31.109
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:31:31.277 --> 01:31:34.404
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.823
And it ain't about me
missing your brains running things.

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.033
I know.

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:42.329
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:45.040
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:51.212
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:54.841
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:58.887
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:02.932
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:06.395
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:09.231
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:13.736
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:17.573
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

01:32:20.369 --> 01:32:21.869
What?

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:27.708
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.418
Tell him.

01:32:31.088 --> 01:32:34.090
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:37.968
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

01:32:38.679 --> 01:32:40.971
I heard something else this morning too.

01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:45.810
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe forgot to ask him something.

01:32:46.436 --> 01:32:49.188
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:52.442
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:11.711
"Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6, 1957.

01:33:11.878 --> 01:33:14.505
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983."

01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:19.301
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:21.804
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

01:33:21.972 --> 01:33:26.142
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

01:33:26.309 --> 01:33:31.230
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

01:33:31.398 --> 01:33:33.649
...released on lack of evidence again.

01:33:33.817 --> 01:33:36.527
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:40.907
Ooh. "A known associate,
one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond...

01:33:41.075 --> 01:33:44.661
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection. "

01:33:44.829 --> 01:33:46.329
Comic books? You go, Ray.

01:33:46.497 --> 01:33:49.166
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:51.084
Oh, excuse me.

01:33:51.252 --> 01:33:55.172
"Raymond returned said literature
unharmed. " Does a year solid inside.

01:33:55.339 --> 01:33:56.673
Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:33:56.841 --> 01:33:59.342
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:01.344
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

01:34:01.512 --> 01:34:04.055
Mm, evidently not.

01:34:04.223 --> 01:34:08.560
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

01:34:08.728 --> 01:34:13.190
...trafficking stolen goods across state
lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

01:34:13.357 --> 01:34:16.193
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:21.031
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

01:34:21.199 --> 01:34:26.037
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

01:34:26.205 --> 01:34:27.872
...he does no time.

01:34:28.665 --> 01:34:32.084
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

01:34:32.252 --> 01:34:36.547
- August 1989, poof, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

01:34:36.715 --> 01:34:40.009
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

01:34:40.177 --> 01:34:43.763
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:48.559
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

01:34:48.727 --> 01:34:52.563
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

01:34:53.232 --> 01:34:55.608
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

01:34:55.776 --> 01:34:58.402
Let's take a look.
"Known criminal associates:

01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:03.407
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

01:35:04.076 --> 01:35:05.243
...Anthony Waxman. "

01:35:08.288 --> 01:35:10.122
And one James Markum.

01:35:12.377 --> 01:35:14.753
And the hits just keep on coming.

01:35:18.633 --> 01:35:22.094
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

01:35:22.262 --> 01:35:24.346
I already gotta get back.

01:35:24.722 --> 01:35:27.933
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

01:35:28.101 --> 01:35:31.603
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

01:35:31.771 --> 01:35:36.275
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

01:35:36.484 --> 01:35:39.528
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

01:35:39.696 --> 01:35:42.030
I think we pulled him over
in New Bedford.

01:35:42.198 --> 01:35:43.240
But Harris walked.

01:35:43.741 --> 01:35:45.742
He didn't walk, he rolled.

01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:50.122
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:51.874
On who?

01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:54.668
What the fuck was the name?

01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:58.798
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

01:35:58.966 --> 01:36:00.758
Jimmy Markum.

01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:05.930
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

01:36:06.223 --> 01:36:08.975
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

01:36:09.143 --> 01:36:12.729
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

01:36:12.897 --> 01:36:16.649
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

01:36:16.817 --> 01:36:19.027
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

01:36:19.194 --> 01:36:22.739
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

01:36:23.991 --> 01:36:26.534
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

01:36:26.702 --> 01:36:29.662
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:31.497
What's that tell you?

01:36:42.843 --> 01:36:45.511
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.515
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
I'm good.

01:36:48.683 --> 01:36:51.352
Okay. Hey.

01:36:51.519 --> 01:36:54.063
Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:58.025
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

01:37:01.029 --> 01:37:02.696
Step into my office.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.335
Beautiful day, huh?

01:37:24.469 --> 01:37:26.512
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

01:37:32.394 --> 01:37:34.854
I took Michael last night...

01:37:35.398 --> 01:37:37.107
...and I went to a motel.

01:37:39.318 --> 01:37:40.568
Okay.

01:37:41.654 --> 01:37:43.488
I don't know, Jim.

01:37:44.907 --> 01:37:46.908
I might have left Dave for good.

01:37:48.411 --> 01:37:50.286
You left Dave?

01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:55.041
Yeah.

01:37:56.252 --> 01:37:57.752
Well...

01:37:59.338 --> 01:38:02.632
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

01:38:05.302 --> 01:38:07.137
I'm almost afraid of him.

01:38:11.392 --> 01:38:13.143
Do you know something?

01:38:16.272 --> 01:38:19.274
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

01:38:19.943 --> 01:38:21.860
He saw Katie the night
she was murdered.

01:38:22.028 --> 01:38:25.280
Didn't tell me about it
till after the cops questioned him.

01:38:25.448 --> 01:38:29.617
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

01:38:30.494 --> 01:38:32.787
Is there anything else I should know?

01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:42.213
Come here.

01:38:44.842 --> 01:38:46.342
Okay.

01:38:47.428 --> 01:38:49.721
At 3 in the morning...

01:38:50.014 --> 01:38:55.477
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

01:38:59.315 --> 01:39:01.316
What did he say happened?

01:39:02.943 --> 01:39:06.446
That he was mugged.
That he...

01:39:06.614 --> 01:39:09.408
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:10.826
That...

01:39:10.994 --> 01:39:13.329
That he might have killed him.

01:39:20.003 --> 01:39:23.047
But there was nothing in the paper.

01:39:31.723 --> 01:39:39.105
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

01:39:39.272 --> 01:39:40.773
Celeste?

01:39:45.237 --> 01:39:47.655
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

01:39:52.702 --> 01:39:54.704
Okay. All right.

01:39:54.872 --> 01:39:56.373
Okay.

01:39:57.375 --> 01:39:59.209
Oh, God.

01:40:05.424 --> 01:40:06.925
Okay.

01:40:09.512 --> 01:40:11.555
Oh, my God.

01:40:12.765 --> 01:40:15.767
Tell me about your father.
What?

01:40:15.935 --> 01:40:19.896
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:23.942
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

01:40:25.027 --> 01:40:27.279
I remember little things.

01:40:28.072 --> 01:40:30.782
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

01:40:31.409 --> 01:40:32.909
He...

01:40:33.578 --> 01:40:35.120
He what?

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:40.584
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

01:40:41.086 --> 01:40:43.254
You could always hear him
coming home.

01:40:43.422 --> 01:40:48.676
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

01:40:49.553 --> 01:40:51.929
You remember your father having a gun?

01:40:52.472 --> 01:40:53.931
No.

01:40:54.099 --> 01:40:58.561
Well, you seem awfully sure for
somebody who was 6 when he left.

01:40:59.313 --> 01:41:00.855
What's up?

01:41:01.023 --> 01:41:03.858
- What's that?
This is what you asked for.

01:41:04.026 --> 01:41:08.613
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.448
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

01:41:11.158 --> 01:41:13.784
We were talking about your father's gun.

01:41:14.745 --> 01:41:20.166
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

01:41:21.001 --> 01:41:23.920
- So when was the last time you talked?
- Never.

01:41:24.129 --> 01:41:25.421
Never?

01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:27.883
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

01:41:28.051 --> 01:41:31.553
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

01:41:31.721 --> 01:41:33.430
Because he's not missing.

01:41:33.598 --> 01:41:36.475
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

01:41:37.101 --> 01:41:41.063
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

01:41:42.315 --> 01:41:45.275
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

01:41:46.819 --> 01:41:49.488
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

01:41:52.283 --> 01:41:54.326
Who else would send it?

01:41:55.495 --> 01:41:57.579
My ma says that's the way he was.

01:41:57.747 --> 01:42:00.666
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

01:42:04.337 --> 01:42:07.172
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

01:42:09.092 --> 01:42:10.550
You know why, kid.

01:42:11.094 --> 01:42:12.386
No, I don't.

01:42:13.346 --> 01:42:15.181
The gun that killed your girlfriend...

01:42:15.349 --> 01:42:18.226
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

01:42:19.144 --> 01:42:20.395
So...

01:42:21.021 --> 01:42:23.022
...you wanna tell me about it?

01:42:26.026 --> 01:42:28.361
My father didn't have a gun.

01:42:28.529 --> 01:42:30.530
You are fucking lying!

01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:38.663
Can I go now?

01:42:39.415 --> 01:42:42.208
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

01:42:55.389 --> 01:42:59.058
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

01:43:00.019 --> 01:43:01.770
Hey, Val.

01:43:02.147 --> 01:43:04.440
Nick. How you guys holding up?

01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:07.234
All right.
- It's fucked up.

01:43:09.654 --> 01:43:11.155
Katie.

01:43:12.574 --> 01:43:14.408
A fucking tragedy.

01:43:15.577 --> 01:43:16.827
Yeah.

01:43:16.995 --> 01:43:19.705
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.290
Yeah?

01:43:22.083 --> 01:43:24.335
Yeah. What do you say, man? Hm?

01:43:24.502 --> 01:43:28.297
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

01:43:30.925 --> 01:43:34.636
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

01:43:34.804 --> 01:43:36.597
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

01:43:37.765 --> 01:43:40.933
Well, the first round's on me.

01:43:42.603 --> 01:43:44.645
Now you're talking.

01:44:03.166 --> 01:44:05.292
I think the kid is lying about the gun.

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.878
Absolutely. I told you
three times already.

01:44:08.046 --> 01:44:13.050
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

01:44:13.426 --> 01:44:14.802
Eighty grand. I mean...

01:44:14.969 --> 01:44:18.639
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

01:44:19.682 --> 01:44:23.310
Listen, go home, have a drink.

01:44:23.478 --> 01:44:26.939
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:44:27.107 --> 01:44:29.441
Hey, anything good on the 911?

01:44:29.609 --> 01:44:33.195
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

01:44:37.493 --> 01:44:40.662
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:44.040
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

01:44:44.208 --> 01:44:47.168
What's the location of the car?
Sydney Street.

01:44:47.336 --> 01:44:51.089
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

01:44:51.257 --> 01:44:54.092
Son, what's your name?
He wants to know her name.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:57.345
Your name, what's your name?
We're so fucking out of here.

01:44:57.513 --> 01:44:59.389
Good luck, man.

01:44:59.682 --> 01:45:03.685
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

01:45:03.853 --> 01:45:05.437
Her.

01:45:06.188 --> 01:45:09.524
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:16.865
Son, what's your name?
He wants to know her name.

01:45:17.032 --> 01:45:21.161
- He said, "Her name. "
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

01:45:21.328 --> 01:45:23.914
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

01:45:24.082 --> 01:45:27.460
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:33.424
Play it again.

01:45:39.723 --> 01:45:43.225
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

01:45:43.393 --> 01:45:45.686
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
Here.

01:45:45.854 --> 01:45:49.106
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

01:45:49.316 --> 01:45:52.026
Mm, fucking Carson.

01:45:52.194 --> 01:45:56.322
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

01:45:56.490 --> 01:45:58.908
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

01:45:59.075 --> 01:46:03.913
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

01:46:06.875 --> 01:46:09.502
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:11.671
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

01:46:11.839 --> 01:46:17.135
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

01:46:17.303 --> 01:46:19.054
Fucking smiley mask!

01:46:21.516 --> 01:46:23.016
Idiot!

01:46:23.184 --> 01:46:25.644
And you guys didn't notice till then?

01:46:27.563 --> 01:46:31.900
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

01:46:32.068 --> 01:46:34.861
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

01:46:37.406 --> 01:46:39.449
Why do you think he went straight?

01:46:42.161 --> 01:46:44.621
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

01:46:47.083 --> 01:46:48.917
What about you guys?

01:46:50.127 --> 01:46:53.922
What? Us? Going straight?

01:46:55.341 --> 01:46:57.802
That's pretty fucking funny!

01:47:01.557 --> 01:47:06.310
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

01:47:06.478 --> 01:47:08.145
Want another shot?

01:47:11.733 --> 01:47:14.360
You know, I should slow down
till we eat.

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:16.988
Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

01:47:17.155 --> 01:47:18.573
Come on, get up.

01:47:23.829 --> 01:47:25.830
Live a little, huh?

01:47:53.192 --> 01:47:55.110
Slide over, Dave.

01:47:56.613 --> 01:47:59.698
- Dave.
All right, Val! Now you're talking.

01:47:59.866 --> 01:48:03.327
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.873
To our children.

01:48:12.712 --> 01:48:14.671
I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

01:48:16.090 --> 01:48:18.175
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

01:48:18.343 --> 01:48:21.386
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

01:48:21.554 --> 01:48:25.140
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

01:48:25.308 --> 01:48:27.893
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

01:48:28.061 --> 01:48:30.647
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

01:48:30.814 --> 01:48:32.148
Yeah.

01:48:32.316 --> 01:48:34.067
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

01:48:39.948 --> 01:48:41.866
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

01:48:53.087 --> 01:48:55.879
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:58.256
Thanks, Kevin.

01:49:34.461 --> 01:49:37.505
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

01:49:37.673 --> 01:49:43.052
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray,"
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles. "

01:49:45.472 --> 01:49:48.266
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

01:49:48.434 --> 01:49:51.352
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

01:49:51.562 --> 01:49:53.479
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

01:49:53.939 --> 01:49:56.816
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

01:49:56.984 --> 01:49:58.484
Come on. Come on, now.

01:49:58.652 --> 01:50:03.656
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

01:50:26.765 --> 01:50:28.182
Hey, Ray.

01:50:41.362 --> 01:50:44.156
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

01:50:49.037 --> 01:50:50.871
Come here a second.

01:50:56.378 --> 01:50:57.921
Sit down.

01:51:07.306 --> 01:51:09.933
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

01:51:10.226 --> 01:51:14.020
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

01:51:14.688 --> 01:51:19.484
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

01:51:19.652 --> 01:51:22.237
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

01:51:22.404 --> 01:51:25.031
- Shit, that's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

01:51:25.199 --> 01:51:27.700
- Yeah, I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

01:51:27.868 --> 01:51:29.118
...when she was dying.

01:51:29.286 --> 01:51:33.540
The death part you do alone, but I could
have helped her with the dying.

01:51:33.707 --> 01:51:35.750
Why are you telling me this?

01:51:35.918 --> 01:51:40.130
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

01:51:40.298 --> 01:51:42.758
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

01:51:42.926 --> 01:51:44.468
He was begging.

01:51:44.636 --> 01:51:47.388
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

01:51:48.348 --> 01:51:52.017
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

01:51:52.769 --> 01:51:55.604
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

01:51:56.439 --> 01:51:57.857
Who do you hate?

01:52:00.110 --> 01:52:01.694
Come on, who?

01:52:01.862 --> 01:52:03.362
No one.

01:52:05.657 --> 01:52:10.452
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:14.123
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

01:52:14.291 --> 01:52:16.667
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

01:52:17.127 --> 01:52:18.627
Who do you love?

01:52:23.258 --> 01:52:24.925
You love me.

01:52:27.096 --> 01:52:28.471
What about Ma?

01:52:33.728 --> 01:52:37.314
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

01:52:40.318 --> 01:52:44.446
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

01:52:44.614 --> 01:52:47.324
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

01:52:47.783 --> 01:52:49.492
This is the mugger story.

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.828
He wasn't a mugger,
he was a child molester.

01:52:51.996 --> 01:52:54.205
He was having sex with
this kid in his car.

01:52:54.373 --> 01:52:58.168
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

01:53:06.344 --> 01:53:07.594
Get out of here.

01:53:20.359 --> 01:53:21.776
Run!

01:53:22.402 --> 01:53:24.028
Dave, run!

01:53:26.198 --> 01:53:29.909
You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

01:53:30.744 --> 01:53:33.704
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

01:53:33.872 --> 01:53:38.501
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:43.047
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

01:53:44.466 --> 01:53:47.802
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:51.472
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:56.060
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

01:53:56.228 --> 01:53:58.437
I didn't kill Katie.

01:53:59.231 --> 01:54:03.360
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

01:54:03.528 --> 01:54:07.823
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
Letting this piece of shit explain?

01:54:07.991 --> 01:54:10.992
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

01:54:11.159 --> 01:54:15.162
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

01:54:15.330 --> 01:54:18.916
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

01:54:19.084 --> 01:54:20.418
- Fuck!
Shut up!

01:54:24.673 --> 01:54:25.965
Nineteen years old.

01:54:26.133 --> 01:54:28.592
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:31.929
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

01:54:32.097 --> 01:54:33.514
I'm looking at you.

01:54:33.682 --> 01:54:36.392
Why'd you do it?

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:41.772
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.608
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

01:54:44.985 --> 01:54:47.738
No more lies, no more secrets.

01:54:47.905 --> 01:54:50.574
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

01:54:51.451 --> 01:54:55.662
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

01:54:56.622 --> 01:54:59.833
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

01:55:00.001 --> 01:55:01.960
...and I will open you the fuck up.

01:55:07.842 --> 01:55:10.677
I thought I was finished with all this.

01:55:11.054 --> 01:55:14.514
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

01:55:19.812 --> 01:55:23.356
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

01:55:23.775 --> 01:55:27.819
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

01:55:28.446 --> 01:55:32.115
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

01:55:32.283 --> 01:55:34.202
Admit what you did, Dave.

01:55:34.369 --> 01:55:36.662
Admit what you did.

01:55:38.332 --> 01:55:41.250
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

01:55:42.169 --> 01:55:43.711
I know you can speak.

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.468
So say it. Say you love me.

01:55:53.847 --> 01:55:57.517
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.195
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

01:56:16.537 --> 01:56:18.162
I'm coming back!

01:56:24.170 --> 01:56:27.548
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

01:56:27.715 --> 01:56:32.511
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:35.013
Say her name. Say it.

01:56:35.473 --> 01:56:39.351
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

01:56:50.905 --> 01:56:55.409
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

01:56:56.077 --> 01:56:57.744
That's a Sig, right?

01:57:00.081 --> 01:57:02.291
Don't you want to draw it on me?

01:57:03.251 --> 01:57:05.752
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

01:57:06.045 --> 01:57:09.090
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

01:57:09.925 --> 01:57:12.927
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

01:57:13.762 --> 01:57:16.723
- He broke my nose.
We'll arrest him.

01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:20.560
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:22.979
I want him fucking dead!

01:57:30.362 --> 01:57:35.658
Motherfucker.

01:57:37.953 --> 01:57:40.872
Admit what you did, Dave...

01:57:41.957 --> 01:57:43.958
...and I'll let you live.

01:57:44.126 --> 01:57:48.338
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

01:57:48.714 --> 01:57:50.882
You'll go to prison...

01:57:51.967 --> 01:57:55.346
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

01:57:55.513 --> 01:57:58.641
Admit what you did. Admit it.

01:58:03.563 --> 01:58:05.314
Yeah.

01:58:07.484 --> 01:58:09.360
Yeah, I did it.

01:58:12.822 --> 01:58:16.116
Why?

01:58:19.287 --> 01:58:23.582
That night in McGill's...

01:58:24.542 --> 01:58:29.171
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

01:58:30.382 --> 01:58:31.799
What dream?

01:58:33.301 --> 01:58:35.761
A dream of youth.

01:58:38.098 --> 01:58:40.683
I don't remember having one.

01:58:43.145 --> 01:58:45.146
So it was the dream?

01:58:46.816 --> 01:58:49.234
The dream, yeah.

01:58:50.444 --> 01:58:55.824
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

01:59:02.415 --> 01:59:05.375
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:09.587
Hang on. Come here. You did.

01:59:31.027 --> 01:59:33.403
We bury our sins here, Dave.

01:59:36.365 --> 01:59:38.742
We wash them clean.

01:59:40.995 --> 01:59:45.248
His fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

01:59:51.714 --> 01:59:53.757
I wasn't ready.

01:59:59.764 --> 02:00:01.097
It's like I said, Dave.

02:00:04.393 --> 02:00:06.102
This part, you do alone.

02:00:51.024 --> 02:00:52.900
Tough night?

02:00:55.654 --> 02:00:57.655
Yeah, me too.

02:00:59.658 --> 02:01:02.577
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

02:01:11.295 --> 02:01:13.046
We got them, Jim.

02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:18.176
Got who?

02:01:18.719 --> 02:01:20.887
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

02:01:25.476 --> 02:01:28.311
Killers, plural.

02:01:29.105 --> 02:01:34.443
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. And another kid, John O'Shea.

02:01:34.610 --> 02:01:37.028
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

02:01:41.701 --> 02:01:43.076
No doubt?

02:01:43.828 --> 02:01:45.537
None.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.340
Why?

02:01:57.885 --> 02:01:59.635
They don't know.

02:01:59.803 --> 02:02:02.346
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

02:02:02.514 --> 02:02:07.602
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

02:02:09.396 --> 02:02:13.274
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

02:02:13.442 --> 02:02:16.861
But she hit him with her door, ran...

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:20.948
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

02:02:28.874 --> 02:02:30.750
And the beating they gave her?

02:02:33.253 --> 02:02:34.921
Ray Jr. Had a hockey stick.

02:02:38.092 --> 02:02:40.344
All right. Go easy.

02:02:40.512 --> 02:02:42.429
Take a breath.

02:02:43.806 --> 02:02:45.641
Look at me.

02:02:45.934 --> 02:02:47.851
Look at me, Jimmy.

02:02:50.188 --> 02:02:52.523
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

02:02:52.690 --> 02:02:57.027
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

02:02:57.987 --> 02:03:00.239
We need to talk to him.

02:03:00.615 --> 02:03:05.077
Boston P.D. Found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

02:03:05.245 --> 02:03:07.663
A body? The body of a guy?

02:03:08.289 --> 02:03:11.458
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

02:03:11.709 --> 02:03:14.545
They want to talk to Dave about it.

02:03:15.088 --> 02:03:17.130
So, Jimmy...

02:03:18.091 --> 02:03:20.676
...when was the last time
you saw Dave?

02:03:31.397 --> 02:03:34.607
The last time I saw Dave.

02:03:36.151 --> 02:03:39.362
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

02:03:47.663 --> 02:03:52.000
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:59.465
That was 25 years ago, going up
this street in the back of that car.

02:04:08.684 --> 02:04:12.688
Jimmy, what did you do?

02:04:20.822 --> 02:04:23.782
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

02:04:27.537 --> 02:04:30.039
If only you'd been a little faster.

02:04:38.298 --> 02:04:42.008
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

02:04:48.599 --> 02:04:51.225
Sometimes I think...

02:04:52.186 --> 02:04:55.146
I think all three of us got in that car.

02:04:55.981 --> 02:05:00.235
And all of this is just a dream,
you know?

02:05:00.403 --> 02:05:02.571
A dream, sure.

02:05:03.948 --> 02:05:06.241
In reality...

02:05:06.409 --> 02:05:11.121
...we're still 11-year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

02:05:11.289 --> 02:05:14.875
...imagining what our lives
would have been if we'd escaped.

02:05:23.009 --> 02:05:25.094
Maybe you're right.

02:05:25.261 --> 02:05:27.596
Who the fuck knows?

02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:58.128
Yeah, this is Sean.

02:06:04.051 --> 02:06:07.137
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

02:06:07.304 --> 02:06:09.597
I pushed you away.

02:06:12.351 --> 02:06:14.769
I'm sorry too.

02:06:15.730 --> 02:06:18.523
Things have been so messed up.

02:06:18.691 --> 02:06:21.276
Loving you, hating you.

02:06:23.487 --> 02:06:25.155
Come home?

02:06:27.908 --> 02:06:29.868
You change the locks or anything?

02:06:30.995 --> 02:06:32.747
No.

02:06:33.707 --> 02:06:36.834
No, everything is just the way you left it.

02:06:38.003 --> 02:06:40.796
- Nora.
- What's that?

02:06:42.048 --> 02:06:45.718
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.

02:06:46.845 --> 02:06:48.596
Nora, huh?

02:06:48.764 --> 02:06:52.767
Well, I like that. Nora.

02:07:22.632 --> 02:07:24.925
I killed Dave.

02:07:25.718 --> 02:07:28.845
I killed him, and I threw him
in the Mystic.

02:07:29.889 --> 02:07:31.765
But I killed the wrong man.

02:07:32.433 --> 02:07:34.726
That's what I've done.

02:07:35.394 --> 02:07:37.771
- And I can't undo it.
- Shh.

02:07:38.773 --> 02:07:40.607
Jimmy.

02:07:42.610 --> 02:07:44.778
Shh.

02:07:48.449 --> 02:07:51.284
I wanna feel your heart.

02:07:52.078 --> 02:07:53.411
Last night...

02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:57.999
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

02:07:58.167 --> 02:08:01.253
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:03.088
...because you created her.

02:08:03.256 --> 02:08:07.176
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

02:08:07.344 --> 02:08:11.138
...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

02:08:11.306 --> 02:08:15.142
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:18.813
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

02:08:18.981 --> 02:08:22.942
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

02:08:23.110 --> 02:08:29.156
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

02:08:29.324 --> 02:08:32.535
And that is never wrong.

02:08:32.703 --> 02:08:38.624
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

02:08:38.792 --> 02:08:43.504
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

02:08:52.014 --> 02:08:56.518
You said, "Last night. " You knew?

02:08:57.604 --> 02:08:59.813
Celeste called, looking for you.

02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:03.317
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

02:09:03.484 --> 02:09:06.320
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

02:09:06.487 --> 02:09:09.656
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

02:09:09.824 --> 02:09:13.994
Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

02:09:14.412 --> 02:09:16.663
Their daddy's a king.

02:09:16.831 --> 02:09:21.084
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

02:09:21.252 --> 02:09:22.836
Even when it's hard.

02:09:23.004 --> 02:09:27.382
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

02:09:27.550 --> 02:09:30.344
And that's all that matters.

02:09:35.224 --> 02:09:38.894
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

02:09:39.062 --> 02:09:41.356
Everyone but us.

02:09:41.523 --> 02:09:43.691
We will never be weak.

02:09:43.859 --> 02:09:46.027
And you...

02:09:46.946 --> 02:09:49.614
You could rule this town.

02:09:53.410 --> 02:09:56.037
And after, Jimmy...

02:09:56.205 --> 02:09:58.956
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

02:09:59.123 --> 02:10:01.875
Katie would have liked that.

02:11:38.892 --> 02:11:40.809
Michael!

02:11:41.478 --> 02:11:45.689
Michael! Michael!

02:11:46.983 --> 02:11:51.487
Michael!
