WEBVTT

00:07.678 --> 00:09.479
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.481
OUR SIXTH GRADE
GRADUATION PROGRAM?

00:11.482 --> 00:13.243
AUSTIN, HOW DO YOU
STILL HAVE THIS?

00:13.244 --> 00:14.744
MY PARENTS KEPT
EVERYTHING OF MINE.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.586
EVERY REPORT CARD,
EVERY BABY TOOTH,

00:16.587 --> 00:18.248
EVERY UMBILICAL CORD...

00:18.249 --> 00:20.120
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
THAT FELL OFF OF ME.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.492
AWW, YOUR FAMILY WAS SO...

00:22.493 --> 00:23.653
WEIRD.

00:23.654 --> 00:25.125
( chuckles ) THEN WHY WERE YOU

00:25.126 --> 00:26.126
ALWAYS OVER AT OUR HOUSE?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.457
BECAUSE YOU HAD FOOD

00:27.458 --> 00:28.758
AND SOBER PEOPLE.

00:28.759 --> 00:29.700
LIKE I SAID, WEIRD.

00:29.701 --> 00:31.231
( laughs )

00:31.232 --> 00:33.303
WELL, IT WAS SO GREAT
CATCHING UP WITH YOU, MEL.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.435
HEY, YOU FREE FOR
LUNCH TOMORROW?

00:35.436 --> 00:37.107
DEPENDS.

00:37.108 --> 00:40.440
ARE YOU GONNA TRY TO GET ME TO SNORT
MILK OUT OF MY NOSE LIKE IN THIRD GRADE?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.442
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I'M IN!

00:42.443 --> 00:43.473
DON'T WEAR SUEDE.

00:43.474 --> 00:45.615
- GOTCHA.
- OH, HEY GUYS.

00:45.616 --> 00:46.776
JOE, THIS IS AUSTIN.

00:46.777 --> 00:47.817
Mel: MY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP.

00:47.818 --> 00:50.350
HIS BANK JUST TRANSFERRED
HIM BACK TO TOLEDO.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.622
I USED TO LIVE RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO MEL.

00:52.623 --> 00:54.424
THE SOBER FAMILY.

00:54.425 --> 00:55.755
WITH FOOD.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.827
YOU SEE THERE? THE
LEGEND LIVES ON.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.759
( chuckles ) IT WAS
NICE TO MEET YOU, JOE.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.631
- SAME HERE.
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

01:01.632 --> 01:02.763
( quietly ) YEAH.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.465
( door opens )

01:05.466 --> 01:07.367
( door closes )

01:07.368 --> 01:08.598
WOW.

01:08.599 --> 01:09.739
WHAT "WOW"?

01:09.740 --> 01:11.171
OH, NOTHING. IT'S JUST, UH,

01:11.172 --> 01:13.643
I THINK I'M SEEING A
RELATIONSHIP START TO...

01:13.644 --> 01:15.305
HOW DO I PUT THIS?

01:15.306 --> 01:16.806
EXPLODE.

01:16.807 --> 01:18.678
OH, PLEASE. ME AND AUSTIN?

01:18.679 --> 01:20.350
NO, WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE WE WERE BABIES.

01:20.351 --> 01:22.712
WE RODE BIKES TOGETHER,
WE PLAYED "CANDY LAND."

01:22.713 --> 01:27.257
OH, SO HE KNOWS THE PATH
TO YOUR GUMDROP MOUNTAINS?

01:27.258 --> 01:28.419
CLASSY, LONGO.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.761
A COUPLE OF CHILDREN WHO WERE
LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER,

01:31.762 --> 01:33.423
AND YOU HAVE TO GO
AND MAKE IT DIRTY.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.325
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS
TOTALLY PLATONIC.

01:35.326 --> 01:36.826
YEAH, SURE, FOR LIKE...

01:36.827 --> 01:38.528
ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.

01:38.529 --> 01:41.831
HOW'D YOU GET IN TOUCH WITH
AUSTIN AGAIN AFTER ALL THIS TIME?

01:41.832 --> 01:43.374
FACEBOOK.

01:44.835 --> 01:46.536
ARE YOU... ( scoffs )

01:46.537 --> 01:47.677
WHO FRIENDED WHO?

01:47.678 --> 01:48.778
WHO CARES?

01:48.779 --> 01:50.109
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOKED HIM UP,

01:50.110 --> 01:51.281
IT COULD HAVE JUST
BEEN OUT OF CURIOSITY.

01:51.282 --> 01:52.542
BUT, COME ON, AUSTIN'S A GUY.

01:52.543 --> 01:54.484
I MEAN, I SERIOUSLY
DOUBT HE WAS WONDERING,

01:54.485 --> 01:55.715
"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THAT CUTE
GIRL I USED TO PLAY 'DOCTOR' WITH?

01:55.716 --> 01:58.489
'CAUSE, BOY, IT WOULD SURE
SUCK TO HOOK UP WITH HER."

01:59.750 --> 02:01.591
SO IN YOUR SAD MUSCULAR WORLD,

02:01.592 --> 02:02.692
MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T BE FRIENDS?

02:02.693 --> 02:04.694
NO NO NO, THEY CAN BE FRIENDS.

02:04.695 --> 02:07.297
YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT EVERY
GUY WANTS TO HEAR, YOU KNOW?

02:07.298 --> 02:08.758
"LET'S BE FRIENDS." ( chuckles )

02:08.759 --> 02:10.761
A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH
ZERO CHANCE OF HAVING SEX.

02:12.663 --> 02:13.834
THAT'S THE DREAM.

02:17.908 --> 02:19.869

02:19.870 --> 02:21.711

YOU DON'T GET DRESSED ANYMORE?

02:42.933 --> 02:44.634
I'M HOMESCHOOLED.

02:44.635 --> 02:47.667
A STAINED BATHROBE IS
THE OFFICIAL UNIFORM.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.400
AND "NO FREAKIN' WAY" IS
THE OFFICIAL REACTION.

02:50.401 --> 02:52.572
AS YOUR HOME SCHOOL
PRINCIPAL, I'M CHANGING THAT.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.674
- GO UPSTAIRS AND PUT ON A SHIRT AND TIE.
- BUT...

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
ONE MORE "BUT," YOU'RE
GONNA GET A CREW CUT.

02:58.609 --> 03:01.782
IT'S JUST LIKE PRISON, WITHOUT
THE AWESOME SOCIAL LIFE.

03:04.455 --> 03:06.716
NICE WORK. I KNEW THERE
WAS A REASON I HIRED YOU.

03:06.717 --> 03:08.758
YEAH, I LIVE FOR THAT STUFF.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.261
HEY. I'M MAKING MONEY
ON THE INTERNET

03:11.262 --> 03:13.192
WITHOUT HAVING TO
DO ANY ACTUAL WORK.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.865
THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU WANNA
HEAR A TEENAGE GIRL SAY.

03:15.866 --> 03:17.567
IGNORE HIM. GO ON.

03:17.568 --> 03:19.569
RELAX, IT'S NOT SKEEZY.

03:19.570 --> 03:22.402
THIS INTERNET AD AGENCY FOUND
A SPONSOR FOR MY BLOG,

03:22.403 --> 03:25.635
AND THEY'RE SENDING ME AN ADVANCE FOR
THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THEIR AD.

03:25.636 --> 03:27.807
THERE YOU GO. THAT'S
MY LITTLE CAPITALIST.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.509
CONGRATULATIONS.
WHO'S THE SPONSOR?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.680
TAKE A LOOK.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.512
( cheery music playing,
whistling a tune )

03:32.513 --> 03:33.813
THAT'S SO CUTE. LOOK AT
THOSE LITTLE TOP HATS.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.816
WHAT'S THAT? SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE PROM?

03:36.817 --> 03:39.989
KIND OF. KEEP WATCHING.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.693
TOP HAT...

03:46.957 --> 03:47.958
CONDOMS?

03:49.460 --> 03:50.800
YEAH, ISN'T THIS GREAT?

03:50.801 --> 03:52.762
IT TARGETS THE EXACT AUDIENCE
I DELIVER THROUGH MY WEBSITE.

03:52.763 --> 03:54.304
AND KA-CHING... ( chuckles )

03:54.305 --> 03:55.766
SOMEBODY BUYS HERSELF
A NEW PHONE.

03:57.508 --> 03:58.568
I'M GONNA LET YOU
HANDLE THIS ONE, BURKE.

03:58.569 --> 03:59.569
LOWER THE BOOM.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.010
HAPPY TO.

04:01.011 --> 04:02.542
NICE WORK, LENNOX.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.814
THANKS, AUNT MEL.

04:05.676 --> 04:06.716
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA LOWER THE BOOM.

04:06.717 --> 04:07.847
WHY DIDN'T YOU LOWER THE BOOM?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.549
WHAT? WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF HER.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.850
IT'S A PERFECTLY
LEGITIMATE BUSINESS

04:10.851 --> 04:11.951
AND IT PROMOTES RESPONSIBILITY.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.554
IT PROMOTES DOING IT.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.857
FOR GUYS, SAYING "HELLO"
PROMOTES "DOING IT."

04:17.858 --> 04:19.589
BESIDES, SHE'S
MAKING MONEY, JOE.

04:19.590 --> 04:20.730
- THINK OF THE MONEY.
- I...

04:20.731 --> 04:22.593
MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY.

04:24.695 --> 04:25.965
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT
ACTUALLY IS KINDA HELPING.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.967
OH, BY THE WAY, I WON'T
BE HOME TONIGHT.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.499
AUSTIN AND I ARE
GONNA GRAB A BITE.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.341
OH.

04:31.342 --> 04:32.602
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA HAVE LUNCH.

04:32.603 --> 04:33.903
WE SWITCHED IT TO DINNER.

04:33.904 --> 04:34.904
REALLY?

04:34.905 --> 04:36.446
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

04:36.447 --> 04:37.777
DINNER'S JUST LIKE LUNCH.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.779
YEAH, NO NO NO. IT'S,
UH, JUST LIKE LUNCH.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.910
YOU KNOW, EXCEPT
IT'S MANY MANY...

04:40.911 --> 04:42.752
MANY MANY MANY MANY
MANY HOURS LATER,

04:42.753 --> 04:44.754
AND A LOT CLOSER TO, UM...

04:44.755 --> 04:45.716
( whispering ) BEDTIME.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.659
SO CAN YOU MAKE ANY
WORD SOUND CREEPY,

04:49.660 --> 04:51.492
OR JUST ( whispers ) "BEDTIME"?

04:52.723 --> 04:55.695
AUSTIN IS NOT INTO ME.
WE'RE FRIENDS!

04:55.696 --> 04:57.727
IF YOU WANNA FIND OUT IF A
FRIEND'S INTO YOU OR NOT,

04:57.728 --> 05:00.029
YOU JUST LOOK INTO THEIR EYES...

05:00.030 --> 05:01.401
DEEPLY.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.403
AND IF THEY DON'T LOOK AWAY,

05:03.404 --> 05:04.575
THEN YOU KNOW THAT
THEY'RE INTO YOU.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.677
WOW, LOOK AT THE TIME.
I GOTTA GO TO WORK.

05:07.678 --> 05:09.308
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
I GOT ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.640
ALL RIGHT?

05:10.641 --> 05:12.041
YOU EVER TELL AUSTIN
ANY WORK STORIES?

05:12.042 --> 05:13.583
YEAH. SO?

05:13.584 --> 05:15.044
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN TEST HIM.

05:15.045 --> 05:16.686
IF HE KNOWS MORE THAN 10% OF
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WORK WITH,

05:16.687 --> 05:17.947
THEN HE'S INTO YOU.

05:17.948 --> 05:19.489
'CAUSE GUYS ONLY LISTEN
TO WORK STORIES WHEN

05:19.490 --> 05:21.521
THEY'RE TRYING TO RACK UP
FREQUENT BOOTY POINTS.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.824
WELL, ACCORDING TO YOUR
THEORY, YOU'RE INTO ME.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.826
BECAUSE I TELL YOU WORK
STORIES ALL THE TIME.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.059
I DON'T RETAIN ANYTHING
YOU SAY, NOTHING AT ALL.

05:30.701 --> 05:32.031
GO AHEAD, TEST ME.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.863
NADINE. THIRD FLOOR.

05:33.864 --> 05:35.034
WHO IS SHE?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.336
NOT RINGING THE
FAINTEST OF BELLS.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.838
COME ON, I TALK ABOUT
NADINE ALL THE TIME.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.969
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW NADINE?

05:39.970 --> 05:41.671
YOU KNOW, BURKE, IT'S
BEEN THREE YEARS NOW,

05:41.672 --> 05:42.972
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW.

05:42.973 --> 05:45.344
WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU,
MOSTLY I HEAR...

05:45.345 --> 05:46.647
( imitates static )

05:53.654 --> 05:54.654
YO.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.755
WHAT THE...?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.727
YOU SAID SHIRT AND TIE.

05:57.728 --> 05:59.689
A LITTLE MORE OF
THE STUDENT BODY

05:59.690 --> 06:00.991
THAN YOU WANTED
TO SEE, HUH, JOE?

06:05.135 --> 06:06.766
- MEL?
- HUH?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.468
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.640
I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST
THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING

06:10.641 --> 06:12.942
NADINE SAID TO ME TODAY AT WORK.

06:12.943 --> 06:15.004
YOU REMEMBER ME
MENTIONING NADINE, RIGHT?

06:15.005 --> 06:17.376
TO BE HONEST, I'M
NOT GREAT AT NAMES.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.849
OH, YEAH. I DON'T CARE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
WHETHER YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION.

06:19.850 --> 06:22.051
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
AT ALL TO ME.

06:22.052 --> 06:23.883
HOLD ON. NADINE?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.885
SWEATS A LOT?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.417
FALLS ASLEEP AT BUDGET MEETINGS?

06:27.418 --> 06:28.788
TOUCHES ALL THE BAGELS?

06:28.789 --> 06:29.760
WOW.

06:29.761 --> 06:31.390
YOU'RE AN AMAZING LISTENER.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.393
THESE AREN'T JUST TO
HANG SUNGLASSES ON.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.426
SO, WHAT'D NADINE DO NOW?

06:36.427 --> 06:38.428
WELL, SHE SHOWED ME
SOMETHING TODAY.

06:38.429 --> 06:41.601
SOMETHING I'M ACTUALLY
PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.903
- YEAH, WHAT?
- WELL... ( sighs )

06:43.904 --> 06:45.575
HERE IT GOES.

06:45.576 --> 06:47.036
ROSE FOR YOUR LOVELY LADY?

06:47.037 --> 06:48.638
OH, SHE'S NOT MY LADY.

06:48.639 --> 06:50.710
NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE. NO. JUST GO.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.843
GO! THAT COUPLE OVER THERE
NEEDS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.

06:54.685 --> 06:57.617
UM, SO, NADINE SHOWED
YOU SOMETHING?

06:57.618 --> 07:00.650
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT TURNS
OUT I'M NOT YET CONVINCED.

07:00.651 --> 07:02.121
HEY, DID YOU BRING
THAT PHOTO ALBUM?

07:02.122 --> 07:04.594
I AM DYING TO SEE SOME OF
THOSE OLD PICTURES OF US.

07:04.595 --> 07:05.955
OH, YEAH. I COULDN'T FIND IT.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.797
BUT I'M STILL LOOKING.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.799
AND LOOKING...

07:09.800 --> 07:12.131
DEEPLY.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.665
I THINK I SEE WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.136
STARING CONTEST!

07:17.137 --> 07:19.569
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, BURKE. YOU
COULD NEVER BEAT ME AT THIS.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.210
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING...
STARING CONTEST.

07:21.211 --> 07:22.712
( laughing )

07:22.713 --> 07:25.044
UH! I LOSE. OH, WELL.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.647
HOW COME YOU DON'T
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.649
UM, I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

07:29.650 --> 07:31.551
HAVEN'T FOUND ANYONE I
CAN JUST HANG OUT WITH.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.682
LIKE THIS?

07:32.683 --> 07:34.825
YEAH. LIKE THIS.

07:40.731 --> 07:42.191
JOE THINKS WE MAY BE
MORE THAN FRIENDS.

07:42.192 --> 07:43.192
AND I THINK HE MAY BE RIGHT.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.463
AT LEAST I HOPE HE MAY BE RIGHT.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.095
OKAY. UH...

07:46.096 --> 07:47.797
THAT DIDN'T GO WELL AT ALL.
( chuckles nervously )

07:47.798 --> 07:49.098
I'M JUST GONNA CLOSE MY
EYES AND COUNT TO 50.

07:49.099 --> 07:50.469
AND WHEN I LOOK UP,
YOU'LL BE GONE

07:50.470 --> 07:51.641
AND WE WON'T SPEAK
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

07:51.642 --> 07:52.802
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
AFTER A WHILE,

07:52.803 --> 07:53.803
WE'LL GO BACK TO BEING FRIENDS

07:53.804 --> 07:54.804
AND PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

07:54.805 --> 07:56.846
- ( breathes deeply )
- MEL?

07:56.847 --> 07:58.709
A ROSE FOR MY LADY.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.713
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK, NONE OF
THIS WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED

08:03.714 --> 08:07.117
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT
DUMB, SWEATY BITCH NADINE.

08:12.563 --> 08:13.863
HEY, JOE.

08:13.864 --> 08:14.725
♪ SMILE ♪

08:17.127 --> 08:19.498
NOW WHEN YOU CALL ME, I
WILL SEE YOUR SCOWLING FACE

08:19.499 --> 08:21.501
IN HIGH DEFINITION
WITH RETINA DISPLAY.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.634
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT
I'M MATERIALISTIC,

08:24.635 --> 08:26.637
BUT.. ♪ I LOVE MY NEW PHONE ♪

08:27.778 --> 08:29.610
THAT YOU BOUGHT
WITH CONDOM MONEY.

08:30.641 --> 08:31.781
EXACTLY.

08:31.782 --> 08:34.113
GOOD OL' AMERICAN CONDOM MONEY.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.647
WHICH I EARNED DOING THE
KIND OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY

08:37.648 --> 08:38.948
YOU USUALLY ENCOURAGE.

08:38.949 --> 08:41.120
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT TYPE
OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY

08:41.121 --> 08:42.892
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING
WITH THOSE ADS.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.193
YEAH, SURE SURE SURE.
JUST HOLD ON.

08:44.194 --> 08:45.595
( exhales ) LET ME GET READY.

08:45.596 --> 08:46.826
( rock music playing
through headphones )

08:46.827 --> 08:48.128
WHAT ARE YOU...?

08:50.160 --> 08:51.161
( loudly ) OKAY, GO.

08:53.063 --> 08:56.836
HEY. I FOUND THAT OLD PHOTO ALBUM
AUNT MEL'S BEEN LOOKING FOR.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.837
JOE, CHECK THIS OUT.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.869
WHAT?

08:59.870 --> 09:03.542
AUNT MEL MAKING MUD
PIES FOR AUSTIN.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.676
PROBABLY THE MOST EDIBLE
THING SHE'S EVER COOKED.

09:06.677 --> 09:08.147
WHAT'S THIS PICTURE OF
AUSTIN DOING IN HERE?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.849
I THOUGHT THOSE WERE
ONLY CHILDHOOD PHOTOS.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.020
THAT'S NOT AUSTIN. THAT'S, UM,

09:11.021 --> 09:13.022
THAT'S GRANDPA RUSSELL.

09:13.023 --> 09:14.784
HE MUST BE ABOUT THE SAME
AGE AUNT MEL IS NOW.

09:14.785 --> 09:16.285
MEL'S DAD LOOKS
JUST LIKE AUSTIN.

09:16.286 --> 09:17.957
I GUESS SO.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.128
RIGHT HERE.

09:19.129 --> 09:21.090
THAT'S AUSTIN AS A KID.

09:21.091 --> 09:22.091
WITH HIS FAMILY.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.933
THE BLONDE KID SURROUNDED BY

09:23.934 --> 09:25.264
THE SWARTHY-LOOKING PEOPLE

09:25.265 --> 09:27.867
WITH THE BLACK, CURLY
HAIR AND THE GLASSES?

09:27.868 --> 09:28.968
YEAH.

09:28.969 --> 09:29.969
MAYBE HE WAS ADOPTED.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.671
WELL... ( clears throat )

09:31.672 --> 09:32.842
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

09:32.843 --> 09:35.304
I HAVE P.E. OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY.

09:35.305 --> 09:37.307
PLAYING A LITTLE
GAME OF ONE-ON-NONE.

09:38.809 --> 09:40.280
GOT A GREAT WINNING
STREAK GOING.

09:41.351 --> 09:43.713
SURE. OKAY.

09:43.714 --> 09:44.884
( door closes )

09:44.885 --> 09:46.015
YEAH, MAYBE... MAYBE
HE WAS ADOPTED.

09:46.016 --> 09:47.356
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
AUSTIN LOOKS

09:47.357 --> 09:49.358
EXACTLY LIKE MEL'S DAD

09:49.359 --> 09:51.360
AND THEY LIVED NEXT
DOOR TO AUSTIN'S...

09:51.361 --> 09:54.023
VERY ATTRACTIVE MOTHER...
( chuckles )

09:54.024 --> 09:57.196
AND MEL'S DAD HAD A
WEAKNESS FOR LADIES.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.028
THERE'S NO REASON TO
JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS.

09:59.029 --> 10:01.200
I MEAN, MEL AND AUSTIN
ARE JUST FRIENDS

10:01.201 --> 10:02.902
HAVING DINNER RIGHT NOW

10:02.903 --> 10:06.035
BEFORE, UH...

10:06.036 --> 10:07.377
BEDTIME.

10:09.079 --> 10:11.210
WHATEVER YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT, IS IT DONE YET?

10:11.211 --> 10:14.013
IT BETTER NOT BE!

10:14.014 --> 10:15.686
OR YOU MIGHT HAVE
COUSINS WITH TAILS.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.795
( romantic acoustic
guitar music playing )

10:25.796 --> 10:28.728
SO ARE WE REALLY GONNA
RISK OUR FRIENDSHIP

10:28.729 --> 10:31.030
FOR A STUPID LITTLE...

10:31.031 --> 10:34.203
UNBELIEVABLY HOT
MUTUAL ATTRACTION?

10:34.204 --> 10:37.907
WELL, WE COULD KEEP TRYING
TO TALK EACH OTHER OUT OF IT

10:37.908 --> 10:42.111
BACK AT MY PLACE, WHICH HAS A BEAUTIFUL
VIEW OF THE CITY AND NOBODY ELSE THERE.

10:42.112 --> 10:45.415
OH, WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY PLACE
TO GET ALL REASONABLE ON EACH OTHER.

10:47.077 --> 10:48.077
YO!

10:48.078 --> 10:49.679
GUYS!

10:49.680 --> 10:51.280
JOE. YOU'RE HERE.

10:51.281 --> 10:53.282
IS THIS... I MEAN,
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?

10:53.283 --> 10:55.825
WHAT A SMALL WORLD, HUH?

10:55.826 --> 10:56.986
( chuckling )

10:56.987 --> 10:57.987
YOU GUYS USING THIS CHAIR?

10:57.988 --> 10:59.288
I'M GONNA TAKE IT ANYWAY.

10:59.289 --> 11:01.430
WOW, THIS IS AMAZING.
LOOK AT THIS, HUH?

11:01.431 --> 11:04.063
TWO BEST BUDS HERE
HAVING DINNER.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.664
AND NOTHING ELSE.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.736
WAITER. ( snaps fingers )

11:06.737 --> 11:07.897
CAN I GET A MENU PLEASE?

11:07.898 --> 11:09.398
I'M GONNA JOIN MY TWO
PLATONIC FRIENDS.

11:09.399 --> 11:10.700
AS LONG AS YOU GUYS DON'T MIND.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.171
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE
WERE JUST LEAVING.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.672
YOU'RE JUST LEAVING?
OH, MY GOODNESS.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.104
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GO
YOUR SEPARATE WAYS THEN?

11:15.105 --> 11:16.906
AUSTIN, IT WAS SO
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

11:16.907 --> 11:19.048
MEL, I'LL SEE YOU, WHAT, AT THE
HOUSE IN TWO, THREE MINUTES?

11:19.049 --> 11:21.450
GIVE ME A SEC. JOE?

11:21.451 --> 11:23.282
ABOUT ME AND AUSTIN...
THERE IS SOMETHING MORE.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.714
YOU WERE RIGHT.

11:24.715 --> 11:26.015
NO NO NO NO NO NO. I'M... I'M...

11:26.016 --> 11:27.757
I'M NEVER RIGHT.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.089
I WAS TOTALLY BLIND, LONGO.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.062
SO BLIND NOT TO SEE THAT THE PERFECT GUY
WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME.

11:33.063 --> 11:35.224
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND, WE'RE
GONNA GO BACK TO HIS PLACE.

11:35.225 --> 11:37.026
NO! NO! YOU, UH...

11:37.027 --> 11:38.697
YOU, UH, CAN'T.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.169
WHY NOT?

11:40.170 --> 11:42.171
LET ME THINK.

11:42.172 --> 11:44.173
BECAUSE... BECAUSE THERE'S A...
THERE'S A...

11:44.174 --> 11:46.135
A SITUATION AT THE HOUSE.
( inhales sharply )

11:46.136 --> 11:48.177
IT'S KIND OF A FAMILY DEAL.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.479
VERY VERY CLOSE FAMILY.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.043
CLOSE THAN YOU'D, UM, THINK.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.115
OKAY, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE
HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.347
LOOK, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO DEAL WITH.

11:58.348 --> 12:00.020
- YEAH, BUT...
- I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.053
- SEE YOU.
- A ROSE FOR YOUR LADY?

12:04.054 --> 12:05.354
WHAT? NO. GOD, NO.
SHE'S NOT MY LADY.

12:05.355 --> 12:06.356
I'LL TAKE ONE.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.398
OW.

12:09.399 --> 12:10.761
HE'LL PAY FOR IT.

12:14.064 --> 12:16.235
"CHARGES OF UNFAIR
LABOR PRACTICES

12:16.236 --> 12:18.938
AND 16-HOUR SHIFTS
WITHOUT BATHROOM BREAKS

12:18.939 --> 12:22.942
CONTINUE TO BE LEVELED AT THE SHINWONG
FACTORY WHICH MANUFACTURES MANY PRODUCTS..."

12:22.943 --> 12:24.343
"INCLUDING..." ( key clicks )

12:24.344 --> 12:25.444
"TOP HAT CONDOMS."

12:25.445 --> 12:27.346
( sighs ) HOW DID YOU
FIND THIS STORY?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.878
YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW
WHAT I WAS SEARCHING.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.519
JUST KNOW THAT I FOUND IT, OKAY?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.882
( groans ) THIS IS AWFUL.

12:32.883 --> 12:34.924
I CAN'T BE INVOLVED
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

12:34.925 --> 12:36.055
SO YOU'RE GONNA GIVE
THE MONEY BACK?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.057
I CAN'T.

12:38.058 --> 12:42.131
I SPENT IT ON THIS,
AND I LOVE IT.

12:42.132 --> 12:44.964
OH, YEAH. YOUR NEW PHONE.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.797
YOU SPENT ALL YOUR
INTEGRITY ON IT.

12:47.898 --> 12:49.068
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ENJOYING THIS.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.139
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.141
TRUE, BUT AT LEAST
I'M NOT PAYING

12:52.142 --> 12:54.173
A BUNCH OF CHINESE PEOPLE
THREE CENTS AN HOUR

12:54.174 --> 12:56.446
SO I CAN AUTO-TUNE MYSELF
SINGING "GANGNAM STYLE."

13:00.050 --> 13:03.552
SO YOU WANNA TELL ME WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
YOU HAD TO GO AND DESTROY MY DATE?

13:03.553 --> 13:06.785
RYDER FOUND YOUR OLD
PHOTO ALBUM, OKAY?

13:06.786 --> 13:07.988
WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE?

13:09.059 --> 13:11.120
A PICTURE OF MY DAD
WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER.

13:11.121 --> 13:13.823
MM-HMM. WHO DOES
YOUR DAD LOOK LIKE?

13:13.824 --> 13:15.164
MY DAD,

13:15.165 --> 13:16.866
BUT YOUNGER.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.868
COME ON! YOUR DAD LOOKS
JUST LIKE AUSTIN.

13:18.869 --> 13:20.329
- LOOK AT THAT.
- WHAT?

13:20.330 --> 13:22.431
WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE.

13:22.432 --> 13:23.973
WAIT.

13:23.974 --> 13:25.134
ARE YOU SAYING

13:25.135 --> 13:26.436
I HAVE A "DADDY THING"?

13:27.437 --> 13:29.278
NO, I'M SAYING...

13:29.279 --> 13:31.010
YOU MAY HAVE A "BROTHER THING."

13:31.011 --> 13:33.482
OH, MY GOSH. I TOTALLY GET IT.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.845
YOU'VE COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND.

13:35.846 --> 13:37.847
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

13:37.848 --> 13:40.189
HEAR ME OUT, OKAY? LOOK LOOK,
YOU AND AUSTIN GREW UP

13:40.190 --> 13:41.891
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER
WHEN YOU WERE KIDS, RIGHT?

13:41.892 --> 13:44.523
WE ALL KNOW YOUR DAD HAD A
THING FOR LADIES THAT...

13:44.524 --> 13:46.095
WEREN'T YOUR MOM.

13:46.096 --> 13:49.098
ALL RIGHT, AUSTIN LOOKS
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD

13:49.099 --> 13:50.399
AND NOTHING LIKE HIS OWN FATHER.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.530
I MEAN, COME ON, BURKE,
I HATE TO SAY THIS,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.032
BUT I THINK... I THINK YOUR DAD

13:53.033 --> 13:54.203
MIGHT HAVE GONE OVER
TO AUSTIN'S HOUSE

13:54.204 --> 13:56.366
AND, UM, BORROWED SOME SUGAR.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.609
THAT'S CRAZY! AUSTIN'S PARENTS
ARE STILL MADLY IN LOVE.

14:00.610 --> 14:02.371
ALL RIGHT, DO ME A FAVOR. JUST ASK
YOUR DAD IF HE EVER HAD AN AFFAIR

14:02.372 --> 14:03.372
WITH AUSTIN'S MOM, OKAY?

14:03.373 --> 14:05.144
OH, YEAH, THAT'LL WORK.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.416
MY DAD'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY TRUTHFUL
ABOUT ALL THE CHEATING HE'S DONE.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.118
BURKE BURKE.

14:09.119 --> 14:10.279
( stammering ) THIS
IS A BIG DEAL.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.522
THIS COULD BE LIKE... LIKE
"STAR WARS" ALL OVER AGAIN.

14:13.523 --> 14:15.224
SERIOUSLY. COME ON.

14:15.225 --> 14:16.886
YOU KNOW, LUKE LIKED LEIA,
AND THEN LEIA KISSED LUKE.

14:16.887 --> 14:18.527
AND THEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY
WERE BROTHER AND SISTER,

14:18.528 --> 14:21.060
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, GROSS.
IT NEVER HAPPENED."

14:21.061 --> 14:22.861
SO IN YOUR WORLD, I'M LEIA?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.233
- AUSTIN IS LUKE.
- MM-HMM.

14:24.234 --> 14:25.434
RUSSELL'S DARTH VADER. SO
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU?

14:25.435 --> 14:27.166
HAN SOLO?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.998
I DIDN'T ASK TO BE THE
COOLEST MAN IN THE UNIVERSE.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.170
IT JUST HAPPENED.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.471
BUT, LOOK, I GOTTA SAY...
I MEAN...

14:32.472 --> 14:33.973
( scoffs, sighs )

14:33.974 --> 14:35.975
I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.077
SERIOUSLY. COME ON, BURKE.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.508
YOU HAVE NO DOUBT
IN YOUR MIND AT ALL

14:39.509 --> 14:40.509
ABOUT THE WHOLE
BROTHER-SISTER THING?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.211
NO. NO DOUBT.

14:42.212 --> 14:44.553
I MEAN, MAYBE LIKE
THIS MUCH DOUBT.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.185
SURE IT'S NOT LIKE...

14:46.186 --> 14:48.387
- THIS MUCH DOUBT?
- NO. THIS MUCH.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.989
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT MUCH DOUBT?

14:49.990 --> 14:51.520
BECAUSE I THINK ANYTHING
MORE THAN THIS MUCH DOUBT

14:51.521 --> 14:53.162
IS TOO MUCH DOUBT.

14:53.163 --> 14:54.994
WELL, I CAN'T ASK MY FATHER.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.125
I CAN'T ASK AUSTIN.

14:56.126 --> 14:57.296
YOU GOT ANY OTHER
BRILLIANT SUGGESTIONS?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.999
I DO. READY?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.230
D.N.A. TEST.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.102
D.N.A. TEST?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.903
YEAH, HOW DO YOU SLIDE
THAT INTO A DATE?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.307
BETTER FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE
ANYTHING ELSE GETS SLID IN.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.180
OH. OKAY.

15:11.181 --> 15:12.641
I'M THE BAD GUY. FINE.

15:12.642 --> 15:13.642
GO SLEEP WITH YOUR BROTHER.

15:13.643 --> 15:14.644
I DON'T CARE.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.394
"THE SIBLING D.N.A. TEST
CAN DETERMINE WHETHER...

15:25.395 --> 15:27.496
TWO INDIVIDUALS SHARE
ONE OR BOTH PARENTS."

15:27.497 --> 15:30.099
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET A D.N.A. SAMPLE
FROM AUSTIN WITHOUT HIM FINDING OUT?

15:30.100 --> 15:32.431
I'M GONNA TELL YOU. "D.N.A.
SAMPLES CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH

15:32.432 --> 15:35.234
- CHEEK SWABS..."
- YEAH, THAT WON'T RAISE ANY SUSPICION.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.106
- "...TISSUES WITH MUCUS..."
- NEXT.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.237
- "...BLOOD SAMPLES..."
- NEXT.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.509
- "...SEMEN..."
- NEXT NEXT NEXT.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.311
"...OR A HAIR SAMPLE."

15:42.312 --> 15:45.075
REALLY? YOU COULDN'T JUST
START WITH THAT ONE?

15:47.978 --> 15:49.478
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU KEPT
PUTTING OFF OUR DATE,

15:49.479 --> 15:51.950
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK YOU WERE
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT US.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.623
NO. SILLY.

15:54.624 --> 15:55.985
HEY, YOU'RE...

15:55.986 --> 15:57.126
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE
SHAGGY BACK HERE.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.687
DO YOU MIND IF I
GIVE YOU A TRIM?

15:58.688 --> 16:00.389
ACTUALLY, I'M TRYING
TO GROW IT OUT.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.391
NO NO NO NO NO. I
REALLY LIKE IT SHORT.

16:02.392 --> 16:04.063
( gasps ) LOOK, WHAT I'VE GOT.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.995
( chuckles ) NO, SERIOUSLY.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.666
- I GOT A GUY I GO TO.
- OH! LOOK.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.568
MUCH BETTER. YEAH.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.100
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE
COWLICK THING.

16:11.101 --> 16:12.302
MORE WINE? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.007
I GOT IT. A GOOD THICK LOCK.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.078
OH. MAN, I'M SLICK.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.081
TOTALLY DISTRACTED HIM
WITH MY CLEAVAGE.

16:25.115 --> 16:26.115
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

16:26.116 --> 16:27.256
THE D.N.A. SAMPLE.

16:27.257 --> 16:28.617
IT CAN'T BE CUT HAIR.

16:28.618 --> 16:30.659
YOU HAVE TO PULL IT OUT SO
THEY CAN TEST THE FOLLICLE.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.161
PULLED OUT?

16:32.162 --> 16:33.763
YEAH. BY THE ROOTS.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.026
OW. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:37.027 --> 16:39.028
I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD
DO IT WITHOUT YOU NOTICING.

16:39.029 --> 16:41.400
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE EASY.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.232
COME ON, GIRLS. WE
GOT WORK TO DO.

16:43.233 --> 16:44.404
( clears throat )

16:46.306 --> 16:48.307
- HEY.
- WHERE'S THE WINE?

16:48.308 --> 16:50.509
- HUH?
- YOU WERE GOING TO GET US MORE WINE.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.181
OHH. YEAH.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.443
- YOU AND YOUR ADORABLE LISTENING.
- ( chuckles softly )

16:54.444 --> 16:56.445
OW! WHAT WAS THAT?!

16:56.446 --> 16:58.447
OH, I'M SO SORRY. IT
GOT CAUGHT IN MY RING.

16:58.448 --> 17:00.789
YOU'RE NOT WEARING A RING. LOOK
AT HOW MUCH HAIR YOU PULLED OUT.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.451
I'LL JUST GO THROW IT
AWAY IN THE SPECIAL...

17:02.452 --> 17:04.423
HAIR WASTEBASKET
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.095
MEL. MEL.

17:06.096 --> 17:08.357
LOOK, I KNOW
SOMETHING'S GOING ON.

17:08.358 --> 17:09.358
NOW WHAT IS IT?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.530
IT'S... ( sighs deeply )

17:11.531 --> 17:14.363
IT'S... IT'S JOE AND HIS
DERANGED LUNATIC THEORIES!

17:14.364 --> 17:17.366
HE TAKES THIS MUCH DOUBT, AND HE PRIES
IT UP UNTIL IT'S THIS MUCH DOUBT.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.039
HE'S... HE'S A DOUBT PRIER.
JOE IS MRS. DOUBT-PRIER!

17:22.041 --> 17:24.543
OKAY, SO WHAT IS THIS
CRAZY THEORY OF HIS?

17:24.544 --> 17:25.544
( sighs deeply )

17:25.545 --> 17:28.217
THAT MY DAD... GET THIS...

17:28.218 --> 17:31.080
COULD BE YOUR DAD.

17:31.081 --> 17:33.051
WHICH WOULD MAKE US
BROTHER AND SISTER.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.054
( laughing )

17:36.055 --> 17:37.386
IT'S LAUGHABLE, RIGHT?

17:37.387 --> 17:39.057
( laughing softly )

17:39.058 --> 17:40.489
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING?

17:40.490 --> 17:42.491
YOU SHOULD BE LAUGHING.

17:42.492 --> 17:45.094
LAUGH, DAMMIT!

17:45.095 --> 17:46.565
MEL, WHEN I WAS REALLY LITTLE,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.437
I WALKED IN ON MY
MOM AND YOUR DAD...

17:48.438 --> 17:50.139
WHOA, YOU SAW THEM?

17:50.140 --> 17:51.440
AND YOU STILL INVITED
ME BACK TO YOUR PLA...

17:51.441 --> 17:53.542
HAVE YOU NEVER
SEEN "STAR WARS"?!

17:53.543 --> 17:55.544
NO, THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING.

17:55.545 --> 17:57.075
I WALKED IN ON THEM
IN THE KITCHEN.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.108
IT WAS JUST A LOOK, LIKE
I'D INTERRUPTED SOMETHING.

17:59.109 --> 18:01.280
AFTER THAT, I NEVER
THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT IT.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.213
UNTIL NOW. YOU REALLY
THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

18:04.214 --> 18:06.355
NO, IT'S NOT EVEN
REMOTELY POSSIBLE.

18:06.356 --> 18:09.718
MY GOD, YOU HAVE MY EYES!

18:09.719 --> 18:11.790
I THINK WE NEED TO DO A D.N.A.
TEST.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.823
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

18:19.729 --> 18:21.731
( ringing )

18:24.174 --> 18:26.104
AREN'T YOU GONNA ANSWER THAT?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.176
NO.

18:27.177 --> 18:28.637
WHY NOT? WHO IS IT?

18:28.638 --> 18:30.809
THE SOULS OF THOUSANDS
OF UNDERPAID,

18:30.810 --> 18:33.612
OVERWORKED CHINESE LABORERS.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.285
HOW'D THEY GET YOUR NUMBER?

18:36.346 --> 18:38.187
THE COMPANY THAT
MAKES THE CONDOMS

18:38.188 --> 18:39.818
THAT BOUGHT THE ADS
THAT PAID FOR MY PHONE

18:39.819 --> 18:41.820
IS VERY VERY BAD,

18:41.821 --> 18:43.823
BUT THE PHONE ITSELF
IS VERY VERY GOOD.

18:45.495 --> 18:47.456
SO YOUR PLAN IS TO
KEEP THE PHONE,

18:47.457 --> 18:49.298
BUT NEVER EVER ANSWER IT?

18:49.299 --> 18:51.830
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T
HAVE IT ALL WORKED OUT.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.662
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU TO DO

18:53.663 --> 18:54.903
IS TO GIVE UP THE PHONE.

18:54.904 --> 18:57.666
BUT WHERE AM I EVER GONNA
GET ANOTHER ONE THIS COOL?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.808
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
CAN HAVE MINE.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.341
IT'S ONLY A YEAR OLDER AND HAS
MOST OF THE SAME FEATURES.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.512
BUT WITHOUT THE GUILT.

19:03.513 --> 19:05.143
BUT THEN WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR A PHONE?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.246
OH, I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.348
AWESOME! THANKS, AUNT MEL.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.182
UPGRADE!

19:13.523 --> 19:14.923
BILL, BILL,

19:14.924 --> 19:16.425
BILL...

19:16.426 --> 19:17.426
D.N.A. TEST RESULTS.

19:17.427 --> 19:18.588
- GIVE ME THAT!
- BILL...

19:20.360 --> 19:21.660
AREN'T YOU GONNA OPEN THAT?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.832
OH, I PROMISED AUSTIN
WE'D OPEN IT TOGETHER.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.194
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME HOLD ON TO IT.

19:25.195 --> 19:26.835
THEN THAT WAY YOU
WON'T BE TEMPTED.

19:26.836 --> 19:28.368
- GOOD IDEA.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.341
- HEY!
- WHAT?

19:32.342 --> 19:33.442
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
PROMISED AUSTIN.

19:33.443 --> 19:34.444
I DIDN'T PROMISE JACK.

19:36.846 --> 19:37.876
WOW.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.248
OKAY.

19:39.249 --> 19:40.249
THERE IT IS.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.181
OH, MY. NOW WE KNOW.

19:43.313 --> 19:45.184
I MEAN, NOW I KNOW.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.586
( exhaling ) WOW.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.587
I GOT CLOTHES IN THE DRYER.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.718
HUH? JOE!

19:49.719 --> 19:50.859
COME ON, YOU GOTTA TELL ME.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.391
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T JUST
ANOTHER GUY I MET;

19:52.392 --> 19:53.893
THIS COULD BE SOMETHING.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.566
YOU AND AUSTIN ARE NOT
BROTHER AND SISTER.

19:57.567 --> 19:58.567
THERE'S NO MATCH.

19:58.568 --> 20:00.729
OHH! YES.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.401
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW AUSTIN

20:02.402 --> 20:03.602
AND PRETEND LIKE
I DIDN'T SEE IT.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.773
OOH!

20:04.774 --> 20:05.934
HERE'S MY "SURPRISE" FACE.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.506
( gasps )

20:07.507 --> 20:08.977
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

20:08.978 --> 20:11.440
WHAT IF HE NOTICES THAT YOU
ALREADY OPENED UP THE ENVELOPE?

20:11.441 --> 20:12.942
OH, WELL, THEN I DO THIS ONE.

20:14.844 --> 20:16.845
OH, NOW THERE'S NOTHING
KEEPING US APART.

20:16.846 --> 20:18.347
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

20:18.348 --> 20:20.349
YUP.

20:20.350 --> 20:21.691
( flatly ) IT'S AWESOME.

20:28.758 --> 20:30.659
- THIS IS GREAT NEWS.
- YEAH.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.661
SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

20:32.662 --> 20:34.334
YEAH.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.908
WAIT WAIT. ( sighs )

20:39.909 --> 20:41.270
IS THIS TOO WEIRD?

20:41.271 --> 20:43.442
UP UNTIL KINDERGARTEN,
WE TOOK BATHS TOGETHER.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.914
YOU WERE LIKE THE
BROTHER I NEVER HAD.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.916
ARE WE REALLY GONNA KISS?

20:47.917 --> 20:49.318
YOU KNOW, WITH TONGUE?

20:49.319 --> 20:51.820
THAT WAS THE PLAN.

20:51.821 --> 20:52.822
( chuckles )

20:53.883 --> 20:55.454
WHAT IF IT'S... ( sighs )

20:55.455 --> 20:56.455
YOU KNOW?

20:56.456 --> 20:57.786
WEIRD? GROSS?

20:57.787 --> 21:00.489
WAY TO SELL IT.

21:00.490 --> 21:03.492
MEL, IT MIGHT BE ALL
OF THOSE THINGS.

21:03.493 --> 21:05.295
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

21:14.544 --> 21:15.844
- WELL?
- AGAIN?!

21:15.845 --> 21:17.006
SURE!
