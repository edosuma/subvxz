01:25.210 --> 01:28.004
I owe everything to George Bailey.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.298
Help him, dear Father.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.718
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

01:33.802 --> 01:36.429
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.515
Help my son George tonight.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.226
He never thinks about himself, God.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.061
That's why he's in trouble.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.313
George is a good guy.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.732
Give him a break, God.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.942
I love him, dear Lord.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.903
Watch over him tonight.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.696
Please, God.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.073
Something's the matter with Daddy.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.451
Please bring Daddy back.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.578
Please bring Daddy home.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.872
Watch over him tonight.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.541
Please bring Daddy back.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.464
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

02:11.548 --> 02:14.133
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

02:14.218 --> 02:17.303
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.930
George Bailey?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.474
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.435
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.854
That's why I came to see you, sir.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.524
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.860
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

02:32.945 --> 02:34.821
We've passed him up right along.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.366
Because, you know, sir,
he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.911
Yes, but he's got
the faith of a child. Simple.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.038
Joseph, send for Clarence.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.709
You sent for me, sir?

02:48.794 --> 02:51.838
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.506
Splendid. Is he sick?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.800
No, worse. He's discouraged.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.469
At exactly 10:45 p. M. Earth time,

02:58.554 --> 03:00.596
that man will be thinking seriously

03:00.681 --> 03:02.640
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.352
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.645
What are they wearing now?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.857
You will spend that hour
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.943
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,

03:14.027 --> 03:17.488
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

03:17.573 --> 03:20.032
I've been waiting
for over 200 years now, sir,

03:20.117 --> 03:21.659
and people are beginning to talk.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.202
What's that book you've got there?

03:23.287 --> 03:25.454
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.915
Clarence, you do a good job
with George Bailey

03:28.000 --> 03:29.333
and you'll get your wings.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.168
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

03:31.253 --> 03:34.005
Poor George. Sit down.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.214
Sit down? What are we...

03:35.299 --> 03:37.008
If you're going to help a man,

03:37.092 --> 03:39.427
you want to know something about him,
don't you?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.012
Well, naturally, of course. I...

03:41.096 --> 03:42.388
Now, keep your eyes open.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.390
See the town?

03:44.474 --> 03:47.143
Where? I don't see a thing.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.062
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.107
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.568
Begin to see something?

03:55.652 --> 03:58.362
Why, yes. This is amazing.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.032
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.867
Oh, wonderful.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.661
Yay! Yippee!

04:05.746 --> 04:07.747
Okay, boys, let's go.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.498
Hey, who's that?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.417
That's your problem. George Bailey.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.585
A boy?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.713
That's him when he was 12
back in 1919.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.175
Something happens here
you'll have to remember later on.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.594
Come on, Marty.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.512
Let's go, Marty!

04:24.348 --> 04:25.848
Attaboy, Marty.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.351
Hee-haw!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.394
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

04:31.146 --> 04:35.608
Here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother Harry Bailey.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.401
I'm not scared.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.904
Come on, Harry.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.948
Let's go, Harry!

04:42.032 --> 04:44.617
Come on, Harry!

04:44.701 --> 04:46.702
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!

04:47.371 --> 04:48.788
Help, George, help!

04:48.872 --> 04:49.997
Help!

04:51.083 --> 04:53.584
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

04:53.710 --> 04:55.962
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.506
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.092
George saved his brother's life that day,

05:01.510 --> 05:04.887
but he caught a bad cold
which infected his left ear.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.515
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.892
It was weeks
before he was able to go back

05:09.977 --> 05:13.354
to his after-school job
at old man Gower's drugstore.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.231
Mr. Potter.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.608
Who's that, a king?

05:17.693 --> 05:19.610
That's Henry F. Potter,

05:19.695 --> 05:23.072
the richest and meanest man
in the county.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.578
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

05:30.288 --> 05:31.998
Go to work, slave.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.209
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.629
Wish I had a million dollars.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.506
Hot dog!

05:44.386 --> 05:46.303
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

05:46.388 --> 05:47.346
You're late.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.764
Yes, sir.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.399
Hello, George.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.026
Hello, Mary.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.694
Hello, Violet.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.362
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

06:03.447 --> 06:04.780
She was here first.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.699
I'm still thinking.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.867
Shoelaces?

06:07.951 --> 06:09.535
Please, Georgie.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.203
I like him.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.039
You like every boy.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.749
What's wrong with that?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.333
Here you are.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.377
Help me down?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.337
Help you down?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.888
Made up your mind yet?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.723
I'll take chocolate.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.517
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.561
You don't like coconuts?

06:35.854 --> 06:39.065
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.067
Lookit here.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.361
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,
the Coral Sea.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.907
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.493
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.997
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.417
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

06:58.502 --> 07:02.254
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.257
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.

07:05.342 --> 07:08.594
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems
and maybe three or four wives.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.929
Wait and see.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.310
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.854
You're not paid to be a canary.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.481
No, sir.

07:47.843 --> 07:50.845
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.054
No.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.391
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.309
I'll get them, sir.

07:57.394 --> 08:00.187
Quick, take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.606
She's waiting for them.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.024
Yes, sir.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.716
They have the diphtheria there,
haven't they, sir?

08:28.800 --> 08:29.884
Yeah.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.760
Is it a charge, sir?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.429
Yes, George.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.097
Mr. Gower, I...

08:35.182 --> 08:37.600
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.295
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.839
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.716
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.301
It's shaping up into a storm.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.511
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.847
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?

09:17.474 --> 09:19.141
I should have called him yesterday.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.851
Switch it inside.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.563
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.482
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.359
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.735
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.488
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

09:32.656 --> 09:33.989
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.908
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure

09:35.992 --> 09:38.410
on these people of yours
to pay those mortgages?

09:38.495 --> 09:40.829
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.997
Well, then, foreclose.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.749
I can't do that.
These families have children.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.376
- Pop.
- They're not my children.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.378
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.005
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.216
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.885
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

09:54.970 --> 09:56.804
You have no family, no children.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.764
You can't begin
to spend all the money you've got.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.101
I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures

10:02.185 --> 10:05.396
like you and that idiot brother of yours
to spend for me.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.689
He's not a failure!

10:06.773 --> 10:09.608
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.026
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...

10:11.111 --> 10:12.611
- Run along, run along.
...bigger than him,

10:12.696 --> 10:14.863
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.699
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.450
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.286
I'll talk to you tonight.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.627
What?

10:28.712 --> 10:32.047
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.092
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.307
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

10:41.391 --> 10:43.017
I... You...

10:43.810 --> 10:45.185
Didn't you hear what I said?

10:45.270 --> 10:46.353
Yes, sir. I...

10:46.438 --> 10:48.939
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

10:51.026 --> 10:53.694
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.321
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.864
You're hurting my sore ear.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.532
You lazy loafer.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.534
Mr. Gower,
you don't know what you're doing.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.494
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.829
I know you're unhappy.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.622
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.541
You put something bad
in those capsules.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.960
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.421
Just look and see what you did.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.090
The bottle you took the powder from,
it's poison.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.884
I tell you, it's poison.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.802
I know you feel bad.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.893
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!

11:25.977 --> 11:30.022
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.941
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.401
I know how you're feeling.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.154
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.114
Oh, George. George.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.034
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.285
Combination lock.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.705
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.791
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.418
I want a big one.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.253
What did you stop it for?

11:53.338 --> 11:56.590
I want you to take a good look
at that face.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.716
Who is it?

11:57.801 --> 11:58.884
George Bailey.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.929
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

12:02.013 --> 12:03.305
That's the kid.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.393
It's a good face. I like it.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.311
I like George Bailey.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.398
Tell me,
did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

12:12.482 --> 12:13.649
Not a soul.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.735
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.570
Well, wait and see.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.407
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.492
I want something for 1,001 nights

12:23.576 --> 12:28.080
with plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.289
Great big thing, about...

12:29.374 --> 12:31.542
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.044
I don't suppose you'd like
this old secondhand job, would you?

12:34.129 --> 12:35.337
Now you're talking.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.298
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft
in case the boat sunk.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.634
- How much this cost?
- No charge.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.429
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."

12:43.513 --> 12:44.513
That's right.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.391
Well, what's my name doing on it?

12:47.475 --> 12:50.519
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.981
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?

12:54.065 --> 12:55.315
What boat are you sailing on?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.942
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.194
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.407
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

13:03.491 --> 13:05.951
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.077
Forget it.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.746
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.623
I wish I had a million dollars.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.958
Hot dog!

13:13.668 --> 13:15.294
Avast there, Captain Cook!

13:15.378 --> 13:17.629
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous francais, mister?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.965
Hey, send us some of those
picture postcards, will you, George?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.800
Hey, George,
don't take any plug nickels.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.552
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.845
Hey, Ernie!

13:25.472 --> 13:27.389
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.266
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.809
How about driving me home in style?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.561
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.564
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.359
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.652
Hello, Violet.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.030
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.615
This old thing?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.576
Why, I only wear it
when I don't care how I look.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.135
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.222
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.389
No, thanks.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.768
I think I'll go home
and see what the wife's doing.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.938
Family man.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.192
George, Harry,
you're shaking the house down.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.360
Stop it.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.071
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.115
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!

14:27.200 --> 14:29.117
That's why all children should be girls.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.871
Well, if they were all girls
there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.541
George, Harry,
come down to dinner this minute.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.627
Everything's getting cold, and you know
how long we've been waiting for you.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.462
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.799
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

14:46.177 --> 14:48.887
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.766
Oh, you two idiots.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.810
George, sit down and have dinner.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.894
- Fine.
- I've eaten.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.730
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing
for your graduating party? Look at you!

14:58.815 --> 15:00.232
I don't care. It's George's tux.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.109
Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

15:02.193 --> 15:04.403
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!

15:04.487 --> 15:07.698
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.

15:07.782 --> 15:11.743
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal
in the old Bailey boarding house.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.745
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.206
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta
take over a lot of plates and things.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.249
What plates?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.709
Mom, I'm chairman
of the Eats Committee.

15:18.793 --> 15:19.960
We only need a couple of dozen.

15:20.044 --> 15:23.422
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.507
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.594
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.178
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.597
What's the matter? You look tired.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.890
I had another tussle with Potter today.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.976
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

15:36.060 --> 15:37.394
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.355
What's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.358
He's a sick man, frustrated,
sick in his mind.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.277
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.113
He hates everybody
that has anything that he can't have.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.865
He hates us mostly, I guess.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.283
Gangway. Gangway.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.826
- So long, Pop.
- So long.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.911
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.

15:54.996 --> 15:55.954
Put those things in the car,

15:56.039 --> 15:58.290
and I'll get your tie and studs ready
for you. Now, hurry up.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.625
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.917
You coming later, George?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.294
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

16:02.378 --> 16:03.962
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

16:04.047 --> 16:05.464
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.215
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.508
Oh, Pop, just a little?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.427
No, Son. Not one drop.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.138
Boys and girls and music.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.098
Why do they need gin?

16:15.183 --> 16:18.226
Did I act like that
when I graduated from high school?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.478
Pretty much.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.648
You know, George, I wish
we could send Harry to college with you.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.317
Your mother and I talked it over
half the night.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.277
We have that all figured out.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.488
You see, Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

16:29.572 --> 16:32.324
work there for four years, then he'll go.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.076
Pretty young for that job.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.869
Well, no younger than I was.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.288
Well, you were born older, George.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.832
How's that?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.626
I said you were born older.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.086
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do

16:44.170 --> 16:45.462
when you get out of college.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.506
Well, you know
what I've always talked about,

16:47.590 --> 16:51.009
build things, design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.427
All that stuff I've been talking about.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.304
Still after that first million
before you're 30?

16:54.389 --> 16:56.848
I'll settle for half that in cash.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.559
Of course, it's just a hope.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.853
But you wouldn't consider coming back

17:01.938 --> 17:04.146
to the Building and Loan, would you?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.401
Well, I... I...

17:10.070 --> 17:12.864
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable,

17:12.949 --> 17:14.782
and you could hear everything
that's going on.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.327
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.954
You would, eh?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.248
I know it's soon to talk about it.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.916
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.920
I couldn't face being cooped up
for the rest of my life

17:27.003 --> 17:28.797
in a shabby little office.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.260
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...

17:33.636 --> 17:35.971
It's this business of nickels and dimes

17:36.055 --> 17:38.223
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

17:38.307 --> 17:40.225
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.395
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big
and something important.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.398
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way,

17:46.482 --> 17:48.400
we're doing something important,

17:48.484 --> 17:50.736
satisfying a fundamental urge.

17:50.820 --> 17:55.073
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.117
And we're helping him get those things

17:57.201 --> 17:58.869
in our shabby little office.

17:58.953 --> 18:02.622
I know, Pop. I know that.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.750
I wish I felt that...

18:05.877 --> 18:09.254
I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

18:09.672 --> 18:12.466
Most of my friends
have already finished college.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.969
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.682
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.476
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.102
This town is no place for any man

18:24.187 --> 18:26.480
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.107
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.069
You get yourself an education
and get out of here.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.449
Pop, you want a shock?

18:38.993 --> 18:41.077
I think you're a great guy.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.917
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.920
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.173
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.805
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.515
Have a good time, Son.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.729
Excuse me.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.314
There you are.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.482
George, hello.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.775
You know my kid brother George.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.819
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.195
Hee-haw!

19:15.279 --> 19:16.655
Sam Wainwright.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.323
How are you? When did you get here?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.492
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.952
Old college graduate now.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.120
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright
they call me.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.998
Well, freshman, looks like
you're gonna make it after all, huh?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.501
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.628
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.547
Yeah, he's followed every game,
and his mouth's watering.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.799
He wants me to find out
if you're gonna come along with us.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.425
Well, I got to make some dough first.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.053
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.805
Not broken down old guys like this one.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.014
Hee-haw!

19:43.432 --> 19:45.475
George, welcome back.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.185
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

19:47.270 --> 19:49.479
Putting a pool under this floor was
a great idea.

19:49.564 --> 19:50.856
Saved us another building.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.816
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.694
There's lots of stuff here to eat
and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.654
A third dance... A third...

19:57.738 --> 20:00.866
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?

20:00.950 --> 20:02.117
George.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.035
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.204
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?

20:06.289 --> 20:08.164
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.667
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.044
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.462
Dance with her, will you?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.674
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough
already with all these kids.

20:17.758 --> 20:18.800
Come on, be a sport.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.220
Just dance with her one time, and you'll
give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

20:22.305 --> 20:23.805
Don't be long, Marty.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.599
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

20:25.683 --> 20:27.684
The next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.686
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.480
If it hadn't been for that,
that race'd have been a cinch.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.525
I tried to find out who it was later,
but I couldn't find out.

20:35.610 --> 20:39.279
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,
because they'd be scared.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.822
'Cause they know
what kind of a guy I am.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.033
You remember George. This is Mary.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.743
Well, I'll be seeing you.

20:44.827 --> 20:45.911
Well, well, well.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.705
Now to get back to my story, see?

20:51.459 --> 20:53.168
Hey, this is my dance.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.836
Why don't you stop annoying people?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.047
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

21:00.301 --> 21:02.886
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.555
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.848
Well, I don't.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.267
You've passed me on the street
almost every day.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.435
Me?

21:10.519 --> 21:13.688
No. That was a little girl
named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.525
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!

21:19.737 --> 21:22.572
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.450
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.660
Let's go!

21:37.171 --> 21:38.421
I'm not very good at this.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.090
Neither am I.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.050
Okay. What can we lose?

21:53.521 --> 21:55.397
Hey, you're wonderful.

22:22.633 --> 22:25.135
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

22:26.929 --> 22:30.015
Did you know there's a swimming pool
under this floor?

22:30.099 --> 22:34.269
And did you know that button behind you
causes this floor to open up?

22:35.396 --> 22:38.690
And did you further know
that George Bailey

22:38.774 --> 22:41.109
is dancing right over that crack?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.279
And I've got the key.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.554
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

23:13.893 --> 23:16.436
They're cheering us. We must be good.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.809
Get out of there!

23:55.893 --> 23:57.435
What... Oh, well.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.195
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

24:07.279 --> 24:10.073
Can't you come out tonight?

24:10.157 --> 24:12.659
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

24:12.868 --> 24:16.538
And dance

24:16.914 --> 24:19.624
By the light

24:19.708 --> 24:24.254
Of the moon?

24:24.755 --> 24:27.632
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.884
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.220
You should have seen
the commotion in that locker room.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.056
I had to knock down three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.016
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.768
Do I look as funny as you do?

24:38.853 --> 24:40.687
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.522
You look wonderful!

24:42.940 --> 24:44.274
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

24:44.358 --> 24:46.943
I'd say you were
the prettiest girl in town.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.988
Well, why don't you say it?

24:50.072 --> 24:53.408
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?

24:54.368 --> 24:55.535
Eighteen.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.122
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
you were seventeen.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.166
Too young or too old?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.960
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.505
Yes, sir, you look a little older
without your clothes on.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.967
I mean, without a dress you look older.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.970
I mean younger. You look... You just...

25:15.431 --> 25:17.015
I'm on the thing here.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.017
Sir, my train, please.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.811
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

25:21.937 --> 25:25.148
Your caboose, milady.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.151
You may kiss my hand.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.071
Hey.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.450
Hey, Mary.

25:36.327 --> 25:39.537
As I was lumberin' down the street

25:39.622 --> 25:42.040
Down the street, down the street

25:42.291 --> 25:44.709
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.961
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.963
No, you see, you make a wish
and then try and break some glass.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.673
And you got to be
a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

25:50.758 --> 25:53.635
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.929
I'd like to live in it.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.138
In that place?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.557
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.

25:59.642 --> 26:02.268
Right in the second floor, there. See?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.149
What did you wish, George?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.652
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.820
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

26:12.905 --> 26:15.531
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.451
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

26:18.535 --> 26:20.286
and I'm gonna see the world!

26:20.371 --> 26:23.456
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,
the Coliseum.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.209
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college to see what they know.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.919
And then I'm gonna build things.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.420
I'm gonna build airfields.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.881
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

26:31.966 --> 26:34.342
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.844
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

26:40.933 --> 26:42.642
Hey, that's pretty good.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.311
What did you wish, Mary?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.275
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

26:50.359 --> 26:53.278
Can't you come out tonight?

26:53.362 --> 26:56.364
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

26:56.448 --> 26:59.450
And

26:59.535 --> 27:03.579
Dance by the light of the moon?

27:03.664 --> 27:05.623
What did you wish
when you threw that rock?

27:05.708 --> 27:07.125
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.793
If I told you, it might not come true.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.628
What is it you want, Mary?

27:11.005 --> 27:13.506
What do you want? You want the moon?

27:13.882 --> 27:17.135
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down.

27:17.219 --> 27:21.014
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.598
I'll take it.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.100
Then what?

27:24.560 --> 27:28.062
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it would all dissolve, see?

27:28.522 --> 27:31.941
And the moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

27:32.026 --> 27:34.068
and the ends of your hair.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.114
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!

27:39.074 --> 27:41.409
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.535
How's that?

27:42.619 --> 27:46.080
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

27:47.750 --> 27:49.334
You want me to kiss her, huh?

27:49.418 --> 27:52.795
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.216
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!

27:57.301 --> 28:01.554
I'll show you some kissing that'll put
hair back on your head. What are you...

28:08.896 --> 28:09.979
Mary?

28:21.116 --> 28:23.117
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

28:23.369 --> 28:26.329
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.915
Here you are. Catch.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.418
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

28:36.632 --> 28:39.133
This is a very interesting situation.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.052
Please give me my robe.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.640
A man doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.725
I'd like to have my robe.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.352
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.646
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

28:52.606 --> 28:54.399
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.150
Give me my robe.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.653
I've read about things like this,
but I've never...

28:58.737 --> 29:01.906
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.575
My mother's way up on the corner there.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.619
I'll call the police.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.497
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.457
Then I'm going to scream!

29:12.167 --> 29:13.960
Maybe I could sell tickets.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.172
Let's see. No, the point is

29:18.257 --> 29:20.967
in order to get this robe... I've got it.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.927
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.346
George! George!

29:27.808 --> 29:30.101
George, come on home! Quick!

29:30.185 --> 29:32.603
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?

29:33.021 --> 29:35.857
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.024
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.943
Campbell's there now.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.164
I think that's all
we'll need you for, George.

29:51.248 --> 29:54.125
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.003
I want the board to know
that George gave up his trip to Europe

29:57.087 --> 29:59.839
to help straighten things out here
these past few months.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.799
Good luck to you at school, George.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.843
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.554
And now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting,

30:06.638 --> 30:09.307
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.559
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.853
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

30:13.937 --> 30:17.315
I claim this institution
is not necessary to this town.

30:17.399 --> 30:21.235
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make
a motion to dissolve this institution

30:21.320 --> 30:24.614
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver.

30:24.698 --> 30:26.657
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.742
George, did you hear
what that buzzard...

30:27.826 --> 30:28.868
Mr. Chairman.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.745
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

30:30.829 --> 30:33.164
to talk about chloroforming
the Building and Loan.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.666
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.543
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.045
Very well. In that case,

30:39.129 --> 30:43.007
I'll ask the two executive officers
to withdraw. But before you go,

30:43.091 --> 30:46.219
I'm sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

30:46.303 --> 30:48.513
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.515
It was his faith and devotion

30:50.599 --> 30:52.183
that are responsible
for this organization.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.185
I'll go further than that.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.689
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.983
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

31:01.068 --> 31:03.027
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.947
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.490
That's what killed him.

31:07.574 --> 31:10.284
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.829
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

31:14.289 --> 31:18.167
But ideals without common sense
can ruin this town.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.754
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

31:21.838 --> 31:25.174
you know,
that fellow that sits around all day

31:25.259 --> 31:28.052
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.931
I happen to know
the bank turned down this loan.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.724
But he comes here,

31:33.809 --> 31:38.563
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.732
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.694
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.112
I can personally vouch for his character.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.114
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

31:48.657 --> 31:52.451
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

31:52.536 --> 31:54.787
you can come and borrow money.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.956
What does that get us?

31:57.040 --> 31:59.917
A discontented, lazy rabble

32:00.002 --> 32:01.919
instead of a thrifty working class.

32:02.004 --> 32:05.798
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers

32:05.882 --> 32:09.093
like Peter Bailey stir them up
and fill their heads

32:09.177 --> 32:11.429
with a lot of impossible ideas.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.306
Now, I say...

32:13.390 --> 32:16.267
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.604
You're right when you say my father
was no businessman. I know that.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.315
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan

32:22.399 --> 32:23.482
I'll never know.

32:23.567 --> 32:26.444
But neither you nor anybody else
can say anything against his character,

32:26.528 --> 32:28.237
because his whole life was...

32:28.322 --> 32:30.948
Why, in the 25 years since he
and Uncle Billy started this thing,

32:31.033 --> 32:33.326
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

32:33.410 --> 32:36.287
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.123
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

32:39.207 --> 32:43.294
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.631
Don't it make them better citizens, and
doesn't it make them better customers?

32:46.715 --> 32:48.924
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?

32:49.009 --> 32:50.801
They had to wait and save their money

32:50.886 --> 32:52.345
before they even thought
of a decent home.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.138
Wait? Wait for what?

32:54.222 --> 32:55.890
Until their children grow up
and leave them?

32:55.974 --> 32:58.142
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

32:58.226 --> 33:00.853
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,000?

33:00.937 --> 33:04.315
Just remember this, Mr. Potter,
that this rabble you're talking about,

33:04.399 --> 33:08.319
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.863
Well, is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die

33:10.947 --> 33:12.740
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

33:12.824 --> 33:14.909
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.870
People were human beings to him,
but to you,

33:17.954 --> 33:20.915
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.501
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man than you'll ever be.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.503
I'm not interested in your book.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.339
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.132
I know very well
what you're talking about.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.510
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,

33:32.594 --> 33:35.429
and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.807
Well, I've said too much. I...

33:38.266 --> 33:41.185
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.853
There's just one thing more, though.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.564
This town needs
this measly one-horse institution

33:45.649 --> 33:49.235
if only to have someplace where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

33:49.319 --> 33:50.444
Come on, Uncle Billy.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.829
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.542
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.419
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.212
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.

34:08.295 --> 34:10.922
Well, we're being voted
out of business after 25 years.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.510
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

34:14.594 --> 34:16.554
You still want me
to hang around, George?

34:16.638 --> 34:19.181
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.058
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.936
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.

34:24.020 --> 34:27.063
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.

34:27.149 --> 34:28.899
- I'm only 55.
- 56.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.318
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

34:31.402 --> 34:32.987
now you don't want to miss college,
too, do you?

34:33.071 --> 34:35.531
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.408
They want to keep it going.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.952
You did it, George. You did it.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.246
They got one condition,
only one condition.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.914
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.000
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary

34:46.083 --> 34:47.376
to take his father's place.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.295
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.297
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.009
Dr. Campbell, now let's get
this thing straight. I'm leaving.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.719
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

34:56.803 --> 34:59.263
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.183
But, George,
they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

35:04.019 --> 35:07.021
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.441
Not only that, but he gave
his school money to his brother, Harry,

35:10.525 --> 35:12.026
and sent him to college.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.986
Harry became a football star.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.362
Made second team all-American.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.073
Yeah, but what happened to George?

35:18.158 --> 35:21.368
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

35:21.453 --> 35:23.537
and take over the Building and Loans.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.956
There are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

35:26.041 --> 35:27.041
Look at this. Here.

35:27.125 --> 35:31.462
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,
man with construction experience."

35:31.546 --> 35:33.547
Here's the Yukon, right here.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.008
"Wanted,
man with engineering experience."

35:37.135 --> 35:38.969
There she blows.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.931
You know what the three most exciting
sounds in the world are?

35:42.015 --> 35:44.266
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...

35:44.351 --> 35:48.062
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,
plane motors and train whistles.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.314
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.691
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa
all-American Bailey.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.819
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.488
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.114
Nobody ever changes here,
you know that.

35:59.199 --> 36:00.866
Oh, am I glad to see you.

36:00.951 --> 36:03.160
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.079
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.123
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.542
- Hello.
- How do you do?

36:09.626 --> 36:12.378
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.839
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.549
Here she is. Meet the wife.

36:16.633 --> 36:19.468
Well, what do you know? A wife.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.347
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?

36:23.682 --> 36:26.141
What am I doing? Congratulations!

36:26.226 --> 36:27.977
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!

36:28.061 --> 36:30.187
Why don't you tell somebody?

36:30.272 --> 36:32.857
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.358
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.151
What's a pretty girl like you doing

36:36.236 --> 36:38.195
marrying this two-headed brother
of mine?

36:38.280 --> 36:40.990
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.

36:41.074 --> 36:45.202
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

36:45.954 --> 36:49.874
George, about that job. Ruth spoke
out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.793
You've been holding the bag here
for four years, and,

36:52.878 --> 36:55.671
well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...

36:55.755 --> 36:58.883
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.175
It was a surprise to me.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.219
This is the new Mrs. Bailey,
my nephew's wife.

37:02.304 --> 37:06.098
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.310
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...

37:09.769 --> 37:12.313
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.773
And I want to tell you,
we're gonna give the biggest party

37:14.858 --> 37:16.317
this town ever saw.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.821
Here, have some popcorn.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.492
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.828
Ruth, this...

37:27.954 --> 37:29.079
What about this job?

37:29.164 --> 37:31.582
Well, my father owns a glass factory
in Buffalo.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.418
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.670
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.423
Not much money,
but good future, you know.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.842
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.

37:41.927 --> 37:45.346
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

37:59.986 --> 38:00.986
Hey, Joe.

38:01.071 --> 38:04.657
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.

38:04.741 --> 38:09.411
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.997
What did you say? Huh?

38:12.499 --> 38:14.792
Maybe I'd better go home.

38:14.876 --> 38:17.211
Where's my hat? Where's my...

38:17.545 --> 38:21.131
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.301
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

38:24.386 --> 38:27.721
if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?

38:27.806 --> 38:28.973
Right down here.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.767
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

38:31.851 --> 38:34.144
Now you just turn this way
and then right straight down there.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.312
Oh, that way, huh?

38:35.689 --> 38:40.693
My wild Irish rose

38:43.196 --> 38:46.323
I'm all right. I'm all right.

38:46.408 --> 38:51.245
The sweetest flower I know

39:28.783 --> 39:29.908
Hello, Ma.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.704
That's for nothing.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.666
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

39:37.751 --> 39:40.544
Looks like
she can keep Harry on his toes.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.963
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

39:45.091 --> 39:47.885
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

39:48.595 --> 39:50.637
Came back three days ago.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.807
Nice girl, Mary.

39:55.643 --> 39:58.479
Kind that'll help you
find the answers, George.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.023
Stop that grunting.

40:03.068 --> 40:06.487
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

40:06.571 --> 40:07.988
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.032
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.409
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

40:12.494 --> 40:14.244
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

40:14.329 --> 40:17.081
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

40:17.165 --> 40:20.501
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.088
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

40:24.172 --> 40:28.175
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.511
I don't know about war.

40:33.848 --> 40:37.601
Mother of mine, I can see right through
you right to your back-collar button.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.686
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.775
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.737
All right, Mother,
old Building and Loan pal,

40:48.822 --> 40:52.074
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.367
Oh, George.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.495
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

40:57.831 --> 40:59.164
This direction.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.048
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.104
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.314
I think I got a date.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.151
But stick around, fellows,
just in case, huh?

41:28.486 --> 41:30.237
We'll wait for you, baby.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.408
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.661
- What gives?
- Nothing.

41:38.746 --> 41:39.997
Where are you going?

41:40.081 --> 41:42.916
Oh, I'll probably end up
down at the library.

41:43.001 --> 41:47.379
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

41:48.506 --> 41:49.506
Yes.

41:50.383 --> 41:52.843
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.220
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.

41:55.305 --> 41:57.514
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

41:57.682 --> 41:59.516
Let's go out in the fields
and take off our shoes

41:59.601 --> 42:02.019
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?

42:02.103 --> 42:05.022
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

42:05.106 --> 42:09.276
and there's a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it.

42:09.819 --> 42:13.113
Then we can climb Mount Bedford
and smell the pines

42:13.198 --> 42:14.865
and watch the sunrise
against the peaks,

42:14.949 --> 42:16.366
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

42:16.451 --> 42:18.702
and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.

42:18.786 --> 42:22.581
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

42:23.458 --> 42:25.667
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

42:26.085 --> 42:30.130
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

42:47.774 --> 42:51.193
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.

42:52.278 --> 42:54.363
I just happened to be passing by here.

42:54.489 --> 42:56.281
Yes, so I noticed.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.201
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

42:59.285 --> 43:01.912
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?

43:01.996 --> 43:03.372
About coming in.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.041
Your mother just phoned
and said you were on your way over

43:06.125 --> 43:08.919
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?

43:09.003 --> 43:10.379
Well, how did she know?

43:10.463 --> 43:12.422
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

43:12.507 --> 43:15.342
I just went for a walk
and happened to be passing by here.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.969
What do you...

43:18.805 --> 43:20.639
Went for a walk. That's all.

43:22.016 --> 43:24.893
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.042
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

43:49.377 --> 43:51.628
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.048
But I...

44:07.186 --> 44:10.230
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.

44:11.774 --> 44:14.526
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

44:15.695 --> 44:17.571
Where did you get that dress?

44:17.655 --> 44:20.240
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

44:25.038 --> 44:26.496
I thought you would go back
to New York,

44:26.581 --> 44:28.915
like Sam and Angie
and the rest of them.

44:30.376 --> 44:33.920
I worked there a couple of vacations,
but I don't know.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.380
I guess I was homesick.

44:35.465 --> 44:38.467
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

44:38.718 --> 44:41.762
Yes, and my family and...

44:42.930 --> 44:44.139
Everything.

44:45.475 --> 44:47.184
Would you like to sit down?

44:47.268 --> 44:49.102
All right, for a minute.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.855
I still can't understand it, though.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.066
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.525
Would you rather leave?

44:55.610 --> 44:57.444
No. I don't want to be rude.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.071
Well, then, sit down.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.447
What's that?

45:03.493 --> 45:05.035
Some joke, huh?

45:10.124 --> 45:11.333
Well...

45:12.168 --> 45:15.587
I see it still smells like pine needles
around here.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.464
Thank you.

45:23.721 --> 45:26.473
And dance by the

45:26.933 --> 45:28.308
What's the matter?

45:29.143 --> 45:31.228
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.232
Well...

45:35.316 --> 45:37.692
Nice about your brother Harry
and Ruth, isn't it?

45:37.777 --> 45:39.861
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.279
Don't you like her?

45:41.364 --> 45:43.824
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.

45:44.992 --> 45:48.912
Oh, just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

45:48.996 --> 45:53.542
No. Marriage is all right
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.335
Mary! Mary!

45:55.420 --> 45:56.795
Who's down there with you?

45:56.879 --> 45:58.755
It's George Bailey, Mother.

45:58.965 --> 46:01.550
George Bailey? What's he want?

46:01.843 --> 46:03.176
I don't know.

46:03.594 --> 46:04.970
What do you want?

46:06.180 --> 46:08.473
Me? Not a thing.

46:08.558 --> 46:10.600
I just came in to get warm.

46:13.104 --> 46:15.730
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

46:16.357 --> 46:19.526
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either!

46:19.610 --> 46:22.737
Sam Wainwright promised to call you
from New York tonight.

46:22.822 --> 46:25.824
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...

46:25.908 --> 46:28.452
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.

46:28.536 --> 46:31.121
You're supposed to be the one
that has all the answers. You tell me.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.081
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.

46:33.166 --> 46:34.791
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

46:34.876 --> 46:36.334
- Good night.
- Good night!

46:36.419 --> 46:39.463
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.755
I'll get it.

46:40.923 --> 46:43.633
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

46:52.727 --> 46:54.978
Mary, he's waiting.

46:58.399 --> 46:59.524
Hello?

47:01.486 --> 47:02.819
Forgot my hat.

47:04.822 --> 47:08.033
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

47:08.117 --> 47:11.161
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

47:11.245 --> 47:14.080
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

47:14.999 --> 47:18.293
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.295
You mean old mossback George?

47:20.546 --> 47:23.006
Yes, old mossback George.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.008
Hee-haw! Put him on.

47:25.092 --> 47:27.385
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!

47:27.470 --> 47:29.679
He doesn't want to speak to George,
you idiot.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.598
He does so. He asked for him.

47:32.433 --> 47:35.143
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

47:39.565 --> 47:40.565
Hi, Sam.

47:40.650 --> 47:44.486
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.404
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

47:46.489 --> 47:47.489
What do you mean?

47:47.573 --> 47:49.366
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.368
Here... Here's Mary.

47:51.452 --> 47:53.828
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.372
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

47:55.456 --> 47:58.792
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!

47:59.085 --> 48:00.919
We can both hear. Come here.

48:01.796 --> 48:03.713
We're listening, Sam.

48:03.798 --> 48:07.342
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up
that's gonna make us all rich.

48:07.426 --> 48:10.011
George, do you remember
that night in Martini's bar

48:10.096 --> 48:13.765
when you told me you'd read someplace
about making plastics out of soybeans?

48:13.849 --> 48:16.017
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?

48:16.102 --> 48:18.812
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.

48:20.648 --> 48:23.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.485
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

48:25.570 --> 48:28.071
and he's gonna build
a factory outside of Rochester.

48:28.155 --> 48:29.698
How do you like that?

48:31.409 --> 48:34.619
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

48:34.704 --> 48:37.455
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?

48:37.915 --> 48:41.167
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?

48:41.252 --> 48:44.963
You remember that old tool
and machinery works?

48:45.047 --> 48:47.090
You tell your father
he can get that for a song.

48:47.174 --> 48:48.425
And all the labor he wants, too.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.969
Half the town was thrown out of work
when they closed down.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.346
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.764
Hey, that sounds great.

48:54.849 --> 48:56.725
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.853
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.355
Now listen. Have you got any money?

49:05.067 --> 49:07.068
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

49:07.153 --> 49:08.111
Well, now, listen.

49:08.195 --> 49:11.406
I want you to put every cent you've got
into our stock, do you hear?

49:11.490 --> 49:14.200
And, George, I may have a job for you,

49:14.285 --> 49:18.246
that is unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

49:18.873 --> 49:20.540
Well, this is the biggest thing
since radio,

49:20.625 --> 49:22.751
and I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

49:22.835 --> 49:24.878
Oh, Mary. Mary?

49:27.715 --> 49:28.798
I'm here.

49:29.884 --> 49:31.134
Would you tell that guy

49:31.218 --> 49:33.303
I'm giving him the chance
of a lifetime, do you hear?

49:33.387 --> 49:35.221
The chance of a lifetime!

49:38.559 --> 49:41.144
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.191
Now you listen to me.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.402
I don't want any plastics,
and I don't want any ground floors.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.446
And I don't want to get married,
ever, to anyone.

49:51.530 --> 49:52.947
You understand that?

49:53.032 --> 49:54.991
I want to do what I want to do.

49:55.076 --> 49:58.119
And you're... And you're...

49:58.204 --> 50:01.706
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.

50:04.418 --> 50:05.710
Oh, Mary.

50:07.254 --> 50:10.840
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.677
Mary...

50:14.804 --> 50:16.179
Here they come! Here they come!

50:41.539 --> 50:43.289
Goodbye, George!

50:46.460 --> 50:47.961
Goodbye!

50:55.386 --> 50:57.887
First Harry, now George.

50:57.972 --> 51:00.181
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

51:00.266 --> 51:02.392
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

51:05.020 --> 51:08.440
If either of you two
see a stranger around here, it's me.

51:10.651 --> 51:13.069
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.

51:13.154 --> 51:14.988
Bert the cop sent this over.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.449
He said to float away
to Happyland on the bubbles.

51:17.533 --> 51:19.743
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

51:19.827 --> 51:22.996
By the way, where are you two going
on this here now honeymoon?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.206
Where are we going? Look at this.

51:25.291 --> 51:27.667
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.836
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.297
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.

51:32.381 --> 51:34.632
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.177
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

51:37.261 --> 51:41.765
the richest caviar, the hottest music
and the prettiest wife.

51:41.849 --> 51:44.100
That does it! Then what?

51:44.185 --> 51:47.187
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

51:47.688 --> 51:49.647
That does it, come here. Come here.

51:52.818 --> 51:54.360
Don't look now,
but there's something funny

51:54.445 --> 51:56.654
going on over there
at the bank, George.

51:56.739 --> 52:00.784
I've never really seen one, but that's got
all the earmarks of being a run.

52:08.292 --> 52:11.294
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.129
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

52:13.214 --> 52:14.714
Just a minute, dear.

52:17.718 --> 52:21.304
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.365
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

52:40.449 --> 52:43.284
Charlie? What's the matter here,
can't you get in?

53:00.594 --> 53:02.887
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

53:03.138 --> 53:04.305
George.

53:05.015 --> 53:09.018
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.

53:09.270 --> 53:10.520
Look out, you.

53:12.731 --> 53:14.357
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

53:14.441 --> 53:16.609
There are a lot of seats over there.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.487
Just make yourselves at home.

53:21.073 --> 53:23.491
George, can I see you a minute?

53:24.076 --> 53:26.327
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

53:26.412 --> 53:27.996
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.622
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?

53:29.707 --> 53:30.832
How does a thing like this ever start?

53:30.916 --> 53:32.584
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?

53:32.668 --> 53:34.878
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.296
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,

53:36.380 --> 53:38.756
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!

53:38.841 --> 53:40.967
And then I got scared, George,
and closed the doors.

53:41.051 --> 53:42.719
I... I...

53:44.763 --> 53:46.514
The whole town's gone crazy.

53:46.599 --> 53:47.932
Yeah, hello?

53:48.100 --> 53:50.143
George, it's Potter.

53:53.689 --> 53:54.772
Hello?

53:54.857 --> 53:59.235
George, there is a rumor around town
that you've closed your doors.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.778
Is that true?

54:01.155 --> 54:03.406
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

54:03.490 --> 54:06.826
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?

54:06.911 --> 54:08.286
Police? What for?

54:08.495 --> 54:12.332
Well, mobs get pretty ugly
sometimes, you know.

54:12.625 --> 54:17.128
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

54:17.421 --> 54:22.383
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

54:22.718 --> 54:26.095
They'll close up for a week
and then reopen.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.765
He just took over the bank.

54:29.016 --> 54:30.642
I may lose a fortune,

54:30.726 --> 54:34.604
but I'm willing
to guarantee your people, too.

54:34.688 --> 54:37.148
Just tell them
to bring their shares over here,

54:37.232 --> 54:39.817
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

54:39.902 --> 54:42.028
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

54:42.112 --> 54:43.279
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

54:43.364 --> 54:47.075
If you close your doors before 6:00 p. M.,
you will never reopen.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.335
George, was it a nice wedding?

54:57.419 --> 54:59.420
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

54:59.838 --> 55:00.880
Yeah.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.717
You can take this one off now.

55:13.560 --> 55:18.898
Now, just remember that this thing
isn't as black as it appeared.

55:28.659 --> 55:30.493
I have some news for you, folks.

55:30.577 --> 55:31.995
I was just talking to old man Potter,

55:32.079 --> 55:33.705
and he's guaranteed cash payments
at the bank.

55:33.789 --> 55:35.331
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

55:35.416 --> 55:37.333
But, George, I got my money here.

55:37.418 --> 55:39.002
Did he guarantee this place?

55:39.086 --> 55:42.130
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.

55:42.214 --> 55:43.923
Then, I'll take mine now.

55:44.341 --> 55:45.925
No, but you're...

55:46.760 --> 55:48.845
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

55:48.929 --> 55:52.515
as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.

55:52.599 --> 55:55.143
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.

55:55.227 --> 55:57.478
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs. Macklin's house

55:57.563 --> 55:59.063
and 100 others.

55:59.148 --> 56:00.732
Why, you're lending them
the money to build,

56:00.816 --> 56:02.859
and then, they're gonna pay it back
to you as best they can.

56:02.943 --> 56:04.610
Now, what are you gonna do,
foreclose on them?

56:04.695 --> 56:10.742
I got $242 in here,
and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

56:11.618 --> 56:14.203
Okay, Tom. All right.

56:14.455 --> 56:17.040
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.

56:17.124 --> 56:18.249
Sixty days?

56:18.333 --> 56:20.376
Now, that's what you agreed to
when you bought your shares.

56:20.461 --> 56:22.587
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.

56:22.671 --> 56:23.713
Well, I did.

56:23.797 --> 56:26.424
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents
on the dollar for every share you've got.

56:26.508 --> 56:29.093
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

56:29.178 --> 56:30.762
Well, what do you say?

56:30.846 --> 56:33.473
Now, Tom, you have to stick
to your original agreement.

56:33.557 --> 56:34.891
Now, give us 60 days on this.

56:34.975 --> 56:37.060
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?

56:37.144 --> 56:39.228
Better to get half than nothing.

56:39.313 --> 56:41.397
Tom! Tom!

56:41.815 --> 56:43.649
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

56:44.026 --> 56:47.820
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.

56:47.905 --> 56:49.989
If Potter gets a hold
of this Building and Loan,

56:50.074 --> 56:52.033
there'll never be
another decent house built in this town.

56:52.117 --> 56:53.618
He's already got charge of the bank.

56:53.702 --> 56:55.745
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.581
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.

56:58.665 --> 57:00.917
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.086
And because he wants
to keep you living in his slums

57:03.170 --> 57:05.088
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

57:05.172 --> 57:07.090
Joe, you had one
of those Potter houses, didn't you?

57:07.174 --> 57:08.174
Well, have you forgotten?

57:08.258 --> 57:10.635
Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack?

57:10.719 --> 57:13.846
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last
year when things weren't going so well

57:13.931 --> 57:15.098
and you couldn't make your payments.

57:15.182 --> 57:16.641
Well, you didn't lose your house,
did you?

57:16.725 --> 57:18.476
You think Potter would've
let you keep it?

57:18.560 --> 57:21.270
Can't you understand
what's happening here?

57:21.355 --> 57:22.939
Don't you see what's happening?

57:23.023 --> 57:25.733
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?

57:25.818 --> 57:27.985
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.278
He's picking up some bargain.

57:29.363 --> 57:31.739
Now we can get through
this thing all right.

57:31.824 --> 57:33.616
We've got to stick together, though.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.201
We've got to have faith in each other.

57:35.285 --> 57:38.496
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year, and I need money.

57:38.580 --> 57:40.289
How am going to live
until the bank opens?

57:40.374 --> 57:42.708
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.710
I can't feed my kids on faith.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.462
How much do you need?

57:46.547 --> 57:50.049
Hey! I got $2,000.

57:50.676 --> 57:53.136
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

57:53.220 --> 57:56.013
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
- $242.

57:56.098 --> 57:58.641
Tom, just enough to tide you over
until the bank reopens.

57:58.725 --> 58:00.893
I'll take $242.

58:03.689 --> 58:05.481
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

58:05.566 --> 58:07.859
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

58:07.943 --> 58:11.320
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.

58:11.405 --> 58:14.991
Now, Ed, what'll it take
till the bank opens? What do you need?

58:15.075 --> 58:17.410
Well, I suppose $20.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.329
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

58:20.414 --> 58:21.998
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

58:22.082 --> 58:23.374
But it's your own money, George.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.168
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?

58:25.252 --> 58:27.336
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.

58:27.421 --> 58:29.547
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.

58:29.631 --> 58:31.757
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.

58:31.842 --> 58:35.261
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?

58:37.097 --> 58:40.474
Bless your heart. Of course
you can have it. You got 50 cents?

58:40.559 --> 58:41.934
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.

58:42.019 --> 58:43.519
...six...
- They'll never close us up today!

58:43.604 --> 58:48.107
...five, four, three, two,

58:48.275 --> 58:50.359
one, bingo!

58:50.444 --> 58:52.069
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.

58:52.154 --> 58:55.072
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.

58:55.157 --> 58:56.991
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!

58:57.075 --> 58:58.492
Get some glasses, Tilly.

58:58.577 --> 59:01.829
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.

59:01.914 --> 59:04.415
Get a tray for these two
great big important simoleons here.

59:04.499 --> 59:06.042
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

59:06.126 --> 59:09.587
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar
and to Papa Dollar,

59:09.671 --> 59:11.797
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

59:11.882 --> 59:13.382
you better have a family real quick.

59:13.467 --> 59:16.302
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.430
Okay, let's put them in the safe
and see what happens.

59:26.855 --> 59:28.022
Close the door.

59:28.106 --> 59:30.024
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

59:30.108 --> 59:33.527
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

59:33.612 --> 59:36.239
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

59:36.323 --> 59:38.491
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.

59:38.575 --> 59:40.952
I wonder if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

59:41.036 --> 59:43.454
George, there's a call for you.

59:43.538 --> 59:44.872
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

59:44.957 --> 59:46.332
She's probably over at her mother's.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.959
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.086
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.

59:50.170 --> 59:53.714
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.

59:54.091 --> 59:57.176
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

59:57.594 --> 01:00:01.305
Huh? Come home? What home?

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.810
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:08.854
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:22.451
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.537
How would you like
to get a ticket next week?

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.955
You got any romance in you?

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.624
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.210
Who wants to see liver pills
on their honeymoon?

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:33.713
What we want is romantic places,
beautiful places,

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.631
places George wants to go.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.718
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.052
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:42.013
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.973
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.599
What are they, ducks?

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:50.646
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:53.566
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:05.286
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:33.207
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.755
Well, I'll be...

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:47.638
Mary. Mary, where did you...

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.411
Oh, Mary.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:16.333
Remember the night we broke
some windows in this old house?

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.795
This is what I wished for.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:30.639
You're wonderful.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:53.746
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:57.458
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.251
I own the house.

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:02.838
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:06.258
No more we live like a pigs
in this Potter's Field.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:09.428
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.889
I feel like a queen.

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:15.059
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:18.062
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.314
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:25.528
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.948
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:30.616
All in!

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.703
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:38.499
All in?

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.937
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:02.982
Good old George,
he's always making a speech.

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.359
Hee-haw!

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:09.196
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.908
Bread. That this house
may never know hunger.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.996
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.874
And wine. That joy and prosperity
may reign forever.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.710
Enter the Martini castle.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:27.006
Look, Mr. Potter,
it's no skin off my nose.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.924
I'm just your little rent collector.

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:31.802
But you can't laugh off
this Bailey Park anymore.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.012
Look at it.

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.931
Congressman Black is here
to see you, sir.

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:38.976
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.854
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.189
There's the old cemetery, squirrels,
buttercups, daisies.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.483
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.694
Look at it today.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.655
Dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw,

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:55.034
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.454
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:01.957
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:03.792
Oh, they are, are they?

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:06.795
Even though they know
the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.381
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.425
Every one of these homes is worth

01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:13.636
twice what it cost
the Building and Loan to build.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.138
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:19.725
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.813
but one of these days
this bright young man

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:27.524
is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:33.030
The Bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough.

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:35.240
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.743
We just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory,

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.828
and then we're gonna
drive on down to Florida.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.538
Why don't you
have your friends join us?

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:45.042
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.170
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.339
Still got the nose
to the old grindstone, eh?

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:54.009
Jane, I offered to let George in
on the ground floor in plastics,

01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:55.260
and he turned me down cold.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.138
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.848
Well, I guess we better run along.

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:01.975
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.435
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.978
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.147
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:09.233
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:11.026
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.640
Thank you, sir.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.184
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:45.811
I'll send you a box.

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:55.946
Well, I...

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.991
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later,

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.952
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about?

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:07.666
George, now that's just what I like
so much about you.

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:11.795
George, I am an old man,
and most people hate me.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.882
But I don't like them, either,
so that makes it all even.

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:17.134
You know just as well as I do

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.761
that I run practically everything
in this town

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.430
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.977
You know, also, that for a number of
years I've been trying to get control of it.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.688
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:31.857
You have been stopping me.

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:36.111
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:40.698
and as anyone in this county
can tell you, that takes some doing.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:44.495
Take during the Depression,
for instance.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:47.663
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:51.710
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:54.462
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.841
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.888
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:05.390
Now let's look at your side.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:13.232
Young man, 27-28, married,
making, say, $40 a week.

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:15.274
- $45.
- $45.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.484
$45.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:20.738
Out of which, after supporting
your mother and paying your bills,

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.908
you're able to keep, say, $10,
if you skimp.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:28.330
A child or two comes along, and you
won't even be able to save the $10.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:33.961
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:35.629
I'd say he was doing fine.

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:40.008
But George Bailey is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:43.761
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:47.057
who hates his job,
who hates the Building and Loan

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.809
almost as much as I do.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:54.106
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.359
A young man... The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:59.027
A young man who has to sit by

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:02.573
and watch his friends go places
because he's trapped.

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:06.326
Yes, sir,
trapped into frittering his life away,

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.996
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.792
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:18.797
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:21.466
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.803
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:30.142
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.940
$20,000 a year?

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:40.402
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:43.196
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:46.074
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.993
maybe once in a while Europe.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.411
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:50.829
Would I?

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.168
You're not talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.961
You know, this is me.
You remember me?

01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:59.838
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:03.008
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:07.512
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:17.272
Holy mackerel.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.903
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:26.406
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:31.453
I'm offering you a three-years contract
at $20,000 a year, starting today.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.246
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.541
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:40.545
I know I ought to jump
at the chance but I... I just...

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:45.717
I wonder if it would be possible for you
to give me 24 hours to think it over?

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.469
Sure, sure, sure.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:50.138
You go on home
and talk about it to your wife.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.765
I'd like to do that.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.184
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:56.186
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.231
Okay, Mr. Potter.

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:11.702
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:15.414
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:19.251
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.795
You sit around here,
and you spin your little webs,

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:24.339
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:26.008
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:29.261
In the whole vast configuration of things,

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:32.139
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.223
You...

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.810
And that goes for you, too!

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.983
And it goes for you, too!

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:52.993
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:56.038
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.791
going to New York on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:02.127
maybe Europe once in a while.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:05.213
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:08.508
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.720
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:13.638
and I'm gonna see the world.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.475
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:19.144
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.646
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:26.068
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:29.071
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:30.906
and pull her down for you.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:33.617
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:36.578
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:39.623
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:41.416
And

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.556
Mary Hatch,

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.853
why in the world
did you ever marry a guy like me?

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.524
To keep from being an old maid.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.442
You could have
married Sam Wainwright

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:09.236
and anybody else in town.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:12.322
I didn't want
to marry anybody else in town.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:15.367
I want my baby to look like you.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.536
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:18.995
I promised you...

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:22.124
- Your what?
- My baby.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.378
Your... Your...

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:28.964
Mary, you on the nest?

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:33.135
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:41.059
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:49.192
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:53.029
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.824
Then she had another one, a girl.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.118
Day after day she worked away,

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.121
remaking the old Granville house
into a home.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:04.916
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.881
Potter was bearing down hard.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.721
Then came a war.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:22.100
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.688
Mary had two more babies
but still found time to run the USO.

01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:30.442
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:33.153
Potter became head of the draft board.

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:41.328
One-A.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:44.122
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:48.585
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:52.422
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:55.926
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.385
Harry...

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.804
Harry Bailey topped them all.

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:03.808
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes,

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:08.230
two of them as they were about
to crash into a transport full of soldiers.

01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:12.234
- Yes, but George.
- George?

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.402
Four-F on account of his ear,

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:16.988
George fought the battle
of Bedford Falls.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.824
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.451
Don't you know there's a war on?

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:23.328
Air raid warden.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.546
Paper drives.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:34.965
Scrap drives.

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:36.466
Rubber drives.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:41.596
Like everybody else on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:46.726
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:48.979
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:50.021
Yes, sir.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.942
This morning, day before Christmas,
about 10:00 a.m.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.610
Bedford Falls time...

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:57.988
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:04.494
It's gonna snow again.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:07.872
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.417
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.002
Commander Harry Bailey!

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.629
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:15.964
Now, look, this is for you.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.465
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:19.384
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:23.179
Be sure you spell the name right.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.817
Extra! Read all about it!

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:38.361
George, George! It's Harry now
on long-distance from Washington.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.988
Harry! What do you know about that!

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.573
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.950
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.410
Harry!

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:49.581
You old seven times
a son of a gun. Congratulations.

01:17:49.749 --> 01:17:52.250
How's Mother standing it? She did?

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:53.835
What do you know?

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:55.628
Mother had lunch
with the President's wife.

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:56.796
Wait till Martha hears about this.

01:17:56.881 --> 01:17:59.007
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.133
Harry,

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:03.345
you should see what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:04.512
Oh, they are?

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:06.473
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home
this afternoon.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:07.682
In a plane?

01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:10.185
What? Uncle Billy?

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.645
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:16.191
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:17.317
- George. George, George.
- What?

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:18.526
- That man is here again.
- What man?

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.195
Bank examiner.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.406
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,
will you?

01:18:23.491 --> 01:18:24.699
I'll be right back.

01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:26.242
- Well...
- Harry.

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.828
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:31.039
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.874
We're all excited around here.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.043
My brother just got
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:37.879
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:40.799
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:44.135
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

01:18:44.345 --> 01:18:46.012
Yeah, very funny.

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.975
Well, now,
come right in here, Mr. Carter.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.311
Although I shouldn't wonder
when you okay reverse charges

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.146
on personal long-distance calls.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.815
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:58.566
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:01.403
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.364
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

01:19:04.448 --> 01:19:05.698
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:07.075
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:11.162
December 24.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.337
$8,000.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:23.049
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:26.553
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:30.390
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey
wins Congressional Medal."

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:32.559
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:36.229
You just can't keep those Baileys down,
now can you, Mr. Potter?

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:38.731
How does slacker George
feel about that?

01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:40.066
Very jealous. Very jealous.

01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.360
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.487
Of course,
slacker George would've gotten

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.448
two of these medals if he had gone.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.074
- Bad ear.
- Yes.

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:51.703
After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:55.832
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:06.843
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:10.638
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:12.557
- You forgot something.
- What?

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.142
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:15.226
Oh, sure, sure I am.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:18.730
Well, then, it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:23.485
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.405
How about that finger there?

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:28.573
Well, I...

01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:30.658
Bailey.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:39.584
Take me back there. Hurry up.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.922
Come on, look sharp.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.107
Take me back.

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:16.287
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:17.789
Oh, hello, Vi.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.457
George, can I see you for a second?

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:22.418
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:25.421
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:29.008
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:30.218
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.053
You know, your nephew,
remember? Harry.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.388
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.642
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.353
I ought to have my head examined.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:43.314
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:50.738
Here you are.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:52.407
Character?

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:54.325
If I had any character, I'd...

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:57.829
It takes a lot of character to leave
your hometown and start all over again.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.414
No, George, don't.

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:01.499
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:03.209
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do,

01:22:03.294 --> 01:22:05.086
hock your furs and that hat?

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:07.922
You want to walk to New York?

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:09.799
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:11.301
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:13.177
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.763
That's my business, Building and Loan.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.975
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:21.227
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.193
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.195
Now, let's hear from you
once in a while.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:38.453
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:41.831
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:43.416
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.001
Yeah, he's in his office.

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.295
What's going on?

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:49.505
The bank examiner's here.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:53.217
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

01:22:53.344 --> 01:22:54.927
What's the matter with you?

01:22:55.012 --> 01:22:56.429
Come here.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.659
Eustace.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.494
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:23.498
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:26.084
He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.

01:23:27.252 --> 01:23:28.836
Now, look, did you buy anything?

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.214
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

01:23:31.298 --> 01:23:33.925
Now, we'll go over every step you took
since you left the house.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.009
- Right. This way.
- Come on.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.938
And did you put the envelope
in your pocket?

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:50.149
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:53.027
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!

01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:54.654
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look,

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.323
do you realize what's going
to happen if we don't find it?

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:58.449
Listen to me.

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.326
Do you have any secret hiding place
here in the house?

01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:02.453
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.163
I've gone over the whole house,

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:08.167
even in rooms that have been locked
since I lost Laura.

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:11.379
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:15.550
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:18.553
Where's that money,
you silly, stupid old fool?

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:21.389
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:24.475
It means bankruptcy and scandal
and prison!

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:26.894
That's what it means.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:30.231
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:54.088
Hello, darling.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:55.965
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:57.925
How do you like it?

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.677
- Bless you!
- Bless you!

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.597
Did you bring the wreath?

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:04.515
Yes, Daddy, did you bring
the Christmas wreath?

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.600
What wreath?

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:08.144
The Merry Christmas wreath
for the window.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:09.562
No. I left it at the office.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:11.606
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.776
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.027
What's the matter?

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.696
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:29.665
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.752
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:37.173
All right, fill in that little bare spot
right there. Right there.

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:42.887
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:46.724
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.976
Your mother's so excited. She...

01:26:09.581 --> 01:26:12.083
Must she keep playing that?

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:15.002
I have to practice it
for the party tonight, Daddy.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:18.172
Mama said we could stay up
till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

01:26:18.257 --> 01:26:19.757
Can you sing, Daddy?

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:21.717
Better hurry and shave.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:24.762
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:27.306
I don't want the families over here.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:32.144
Come on out in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:35.314
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.567
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:40.570
Another big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.865
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car. You should see it.

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:46.200
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?

01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:47.368
Yes, Daddy.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:50.037
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.373
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.876
All right, darling, you're excused.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.712
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:02.550
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.093
Caught it coming home from school.

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:06.721
They gave her a flower for a prize,
and she didn't want to crush it,

01:27:06.805 --> 01:27:08.055
so she didn't button up her coat.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.308
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.684
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:13.519
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:14.854
He says it's nothing to worry about.

01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:16.230
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.399
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:19.942
Of course, it's this old house.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:22.236
I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:26.657
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:28.618
Why did we have
to live here in the first place

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:31.829
and stay around this measly,
crummy old town?

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:35.207
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.586
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:42.340
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:44.175
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:46.677
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

01:27:57.522 --> 01:28:01.275
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:02.860
Hi, Daddy!

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:07.198
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:09.325
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:11.077
I want to give my flower a drink.

01:28:11.161 --> 01:28:13.371
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:14.789
I'll give it a drink.

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.207
Now, here.

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:19.794
Look, Daddy!

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:21.295
Paste it!

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.923
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.928
Now, we'll paste this together here.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.309
There. There it is. Good as new.

01:28:35.394 --> 01:28:37.478
Now, give the flower a drink.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:39.021
Now, will you do something for me?

01:28:39.106 --> 01:28:41.857
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:44.986
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:49.490
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep
and then you can dream about it,

01:28:49.783 --> 01:28:51.951
and it'll be a whole garden.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:53.285
It will?

01:29:01.712 --> 01:29:03.504
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:05.006
I'll get it.

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:08.092
Hello?

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:11.053
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:14.306
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:16.017
The doctor said
that she ought to be out of bed

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.309
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:18.936
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:20.354
Let me speak to her.

01:29:20.439 --> 01:29:22.898
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.735
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:27.528
Say, what kind of a teacher
are you, anyway?

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:29.905
What do you mean
sending her home like that, half naked?

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:32.533
Do you realize she'll probably end up
with pneumonia on account of you?

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.577
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:36.787
to have teachers like you?

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:40.124
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.043
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:43.878
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:45.755
That stupid...

01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:49.383
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...

01:29:49.468 --> 01:29:51.594
Hello? Hello.

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:55.765
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!

01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:59.060
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:00.936
Hello! Who's this?

01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:02.563
Oh, Mr. Welch?

01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:04.398
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:06.567
Give me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:07.693
George, stop it.

01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:09.487
Will you get out and let me handle this?

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:12.114
Hello? Hello? What?

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.409
Oh, you will, huh?

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:18.412
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough, you...

01:30:18.497 --> 01:30:19.997
Hello! Any...

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:25.127
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

01:30:25.212 --> 01:30:27.254
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:28.589
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.549
Janie, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:34.345
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.082
I'm sorry, Mary.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:08.254
Janie, I'm sorry.

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:13.092
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.016
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

01:31:22.269 --> 01:31:23.644
I'm sorry.

01:31:25.063 --> 01:31:27.898
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.

01:31:34.865 --> 01:31:36.657
What's the matter with everybody?

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.285
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:40.703
Oh, Daddy!

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:49.545
George, why must you
torture the children? Why don't you...

01:31:50.297 --> 01:31:51.547
Mary...

01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:07.521
Bedford 247, please.

01:32:07.606 --> 01:32:09.648
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

01:32:09.733 --> 01:32:12.818
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:14.945
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:17.907
Hello? Uncle Billy?

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.242
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.203
I need help.

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:26.165
Through some sort of an accident,
my company's short in their accounts.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:28.042
The bank examiner got there today.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:30.377
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.922
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:34.340
- The reporters?
- Yes.

01:32:34.424 --> 01:32:37.801
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

01:32:38.094 --> 01:32:41.472
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:42.765
He's looking for you.

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:46.477
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.395
Can't you see what it means
to my family?

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.315
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan,
any interest,

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:52.983
if you still want the Building and Loan...

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:56.570
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

01:32:56.655 --> 01:32:58.197
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.

01:32:58.281 --> 01:33:01.283
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:05.329
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.044
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:16.215
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.

01:33:16.299 --> 01:33:18.592
What've you been doing, George?

01:33:18.677 --> 01:33:20.386
Playing the market
with the company's money?

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:21.595
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.681
Is it a woman, then?

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:27.351
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:28.477
What?

01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:31.272
Not that it makes any difference to me,
but why did you come to me?

01:33:31.356 --> 01:33:34.108
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.776
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.278
Well, what about all your other friends?

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:39.697
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:41.699
You're the only one in town
that can help me.

01:33:42.909 --> 01:33:46.203
I've suddenly become quite important.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:49.707
What kind of security
would I have, George?

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:53.127
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:56.046
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

01:33:56.548 --> 01:34:00.759
I have some life insurance,
a $15,000 policy.

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:04.555
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.

01:34:04.723 --> 01:34:06.557
Five hundred dollars?

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:09.601
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:14.273
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:17.693
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:23.032
You once called me a warped,
frustrated old man.

01:34:23.742 --> 01:34:27.077
What are you but a warped,
frustrated young man?

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.246
A miserable little clerk,

01:34:29.331 --> 01:34:30.998
crawling in here
on your hands and knees

01:34:31.082 --> 01:34:32.958
and begging for help.

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:35.085
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:38.839
Nothing but a miserable
little $500 equity

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:41.091
in a life insurance policy.

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:44.345
You're worth more dead than alive.

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:47.806
Why don't you go to the riffraff
you love so much

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:50.434
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:52.061
You know why?

01:34:52.145 --> 01:34:54.855
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:58.150
But I tell you
what I'm going to do for you, George.

01:34:58.234 --> 01:35:01.403
Since the state examiner is still here,

01:35:01.488 --> 01:35:04.031
as a stockholder
of the Building and Loan,

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:07.076
I'm going to swear out
a warrant for your arrest.

01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:11.497
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance.

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:15.501
All right, George, go ahead.

01:35:15.585 --> 01:35:18.462
You can't hide in a little town like this.

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:20.923
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:37.981
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

01:35:38.525 --> 01:35:40.192
How about some of that good spaghetti?

01:35:40.276 --> 01:35:41.985
We got everything.

01:35:53.081 --> 01:35:58.919
Oh, God.

01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:05.843
Dear Father in Heaven,

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.973
I'm not a praying man,

01:36:12.142 --> 01:36:15.060
but if you're up there
and you can hear me,

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.313
show me the way.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:21.108
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:24.987
Show me the way, O God.

01:36:29.868 --> 01:36:33.537
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

01:36:36.207 --> 01:36:38.584
Why you drink so much, my friend?

01:36:38.668 --> 01:36:42.045
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

01:36:42.547 --> 01:36:45.048
Bailey? Which Bailey?

01:36:45.675 --> 01:36:47.718
This is Mr. George Bailey.

01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:54.808
The next time you talk to my wife
like that, you'll get worse!

01:36:54.893 --> 01:36:56.226
She cried for an hour!

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:59.480
It isn't enough she slaves teaching
your stupid kids how to read and write,

01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:02.107
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

01:37:02.192 --> 01:37:03.650
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:05.402
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:08.447
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!

01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:16.413
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:19.917
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:22.794
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.796
That's what I get for praying.

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.924
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.133
Yes, you bet.

01:37:28.218 --> 01:37:31.637
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.

01:37:31.721 --> 01:37:33.430
Oh, no, please,
don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:35.182
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:36.642
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:38.810
Please no go away, please!

01:37:57.288 --> 01:37:59.623
What do you think you're doing?

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:05.587
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:08.465
Hey, you! Hey, you!

01:38:09.217 --> 01:38:12.970
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:24.481
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.

01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:12.446
Help!

01:39:14.032 --> 01:39:22.039
Help! Help!

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:26.293
Help!

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:33.133
Help! Help! Help! Help!

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:41.600
Help! Help!

01:39:58.534 --> 01:40:00.827
I didn't have time
to get some stylish underwear.

01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:03.705
Wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

01:40:04.374 --> 01:40:06.124
I passed away in it.

01:40:09.712 --> 01:40:12.589
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.221
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:21.765
How did you happen to fall in?

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:25.018
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.

01:40:25.311 --> 01:40:28.230
You what? To save me?

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:31.525
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:33.735
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:36.905
It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:39.825
Yeah, it's against the law
where I come from, too.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:42.285
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:50.419
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:52.921
I knew if I were drowning,
you'd try to save me.

01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:55.966
You see, you did,
and that's how I saved you.

01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:58.093
Very funny.

01:40:58.302 --> 01:41:00.387
Your lip's bleeding, George.

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:04.558
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw
in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:08.478
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:10.897
That's why I was sent down here.

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:14.651
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.

01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:16.570
I've watched you grow up
from a little boy.

01:41:16.654 --> 01:41:18.071
What are you,
a mind reader or something?

01:41:18.156 --> 01:41:19.281
No.

01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:23.326
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

01:41:23.995 --> 01:41:25.328
Oddbody?

01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:28.498
AS2? What's that, AS2?

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.500
Angel Second Class.

01:41:40.887 --> 01:41:42.679
Cheerio, my good man.

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:48.268
Oh, brother.

01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:51.855
Gee whiz.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:55.692
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks.

01:41:57.737 --> 01:42:02.282
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?

01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:04.201
Why'd you want to save me?

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:07.871
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:10.415
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:14.836
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

01:42:14.921 --> 01:42:17.964
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:22.093
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.

01:42:23.095 --> 01:42:26.223
Well, you look about
like the kind of an angel I'd get.

01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:29.267
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?

01:42:29.352 --> 01:42:33.396
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

01:42:37.693 --> 01:42:39.236
I don't know whether I'd like it very much

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.279
being seen around
with an angel without any wings.

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:44.991
Oh, I've got to earn them,
and you'll help me, won't you?

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:46.451
Sure, sure.

01:42:46.953 --> 01:42:49.579
- How?
- By letting me help you.

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:52.582
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:54.626
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.170
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.

01:42:57.255 --> 01:42:59.798
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:04.135
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:07.430
I found it out a little late.

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:09.850
I'm worth more dead than alive.

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:14.104
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:17.858
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...

01:43:17.942 --> 01:43:20.652
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:22.946
My wife and my kids and my friends.

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:26.283
I mean, look, little fellow, go off
and haunt somebody else, will you?

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:29.035
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.954
Oh, shut up, will you?

01:43:34.834 --> 01:43:37.544
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:46.970
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:51.558
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.

01:43:52.852 --> 01:43:55.729
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

01:43:55.813 --> 01:43:59.149
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:01.860
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:06.907
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.

01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:09.534
What do you think?

01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:11.953
Yeah, that'll do it.

01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:13.955
All right.

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:19.878
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.

01:44:25.468 --> 01:44:28.511
You don't have
to make all that fuss about it!

01:44:29.388 --> 01:44:30.805
What did you say?

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:34.768
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.

01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:38.104
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:40.065
no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:43.610
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:45.820
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

01:44:45.905 --> 01:44:48.448
I haven't heard anything out of that ear
since I was a kid.

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:50.700
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:53.536
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

01:44:58.209 --> 01:45:01.920
What do you know about that?
What's happening?

01:45:03.381 --> 01:45:05.674
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

01:45:05.758 --> 01:45:07.550
What's happened here?

01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.178
What I need
is a couple of good stiff drinks.

01:45:10.262 --> 01:45:12.555
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:16.309
Come on,
soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:18.353
The clothes are dry.

01:45:18.437 --> 01:45:21.606
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.

01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:25.819
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...

01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:28.071
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:29.698
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

01:45:29.782 --> 01:45:32.492
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.

01:45:38.124 --> 01:45:39.499
What's the matter?

01:45:39.583 --> 01:45:42.293
Well, this is where I left my car,
and it isn't here.

01:45:42.378 --> 01:45:45.672
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.

01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:47.298
I guess somebody moved it.

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:51.469
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

01:45:51.721 --> 01:45:53.847
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:56.182
I'm the fellow that owns the car
that ran into your tree.

01:45:56.267 --> 01:45:58.309
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?

01:45:58.394 --> 01:46:00.478
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

01:46:00.563 --> 01:46:03.773
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:11.573
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.

01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:13.867
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

01:46:13.951 --> 01:46:15.118
Pottersville?

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.828
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

01:46:16.912 --> 01:46:20.457
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?

01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:22.709
What's the matter with you?

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:26.004
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...

01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:32.886
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.

01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:35.221
It isn't me.

01:46:35.306 --> 01:46:37.348
Well, maybe I left the car
up at Martini's.

01:46:37.433 --> 01:46:39.768
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.

01:46:39.852 --> 01:46:41.644
Clarence. Clarence.

01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:50.945
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.

01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:53.990
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

01:47:00.331 --> 01:47:03.875
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?

01:47:03.959 --> 01:47:06.002
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?

01:47:06.087 --> 01:47:08.505
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?

01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:10.799
Okay, all right. Double bourbon,
will you, and quick, huh?

01:47:10.883 --> 01:47:12.133
Okay.

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:18.348
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.

01:47:19.517 --> 01:47:21.935
It's been so long since I...

01:47:22.019 --> 01:47:25.688
Look, mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:27.398
That's a good man.

01:47:27.483 --> 01:47:29.651
I was just thinking

01:47:30.528 --> 01:47:33.696
of a flaming rum punch.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:36.574
No, it's not cold enough for that,
not nearly cold enough.

01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:39.619
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.

01:47:39.703 --> 01:47:43.289
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon
and light on the cloves.

01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:45.291
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

01:47:45.376 --> 01:47:48.419
Hey, look, mister,
we serve hard drinks in here

01:47:48.504 --> 01:47:50.296
for men who want to get drunk fast.

01:47:50.381 --> 01:47:53.925
And we don't need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere.

01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:57.637
Is that clear, or do I have
to slip you my left for a convincer?

01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:59.097
What's he talking about?

01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:03.059
Nick, Nick,
just give him the same as mine.

01:48:03.144 --> 01:48:05.478
- He's okay.
- Okay.

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:10.483
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.

01:48:10.568 --> 01:48:13.695
You'll see a lot of strange things
from now on.

01:48:13.946 --> 01:48:15.738
Oh, yeah.

01:48:18.909 --> 01:48:22.537
Hey, little fellow,
you worry me, you know.

01:48:22.621 --> 01:48:25.582
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:27.208
You don't, huh?

01:48:27.293 --> 01:48:29.919
- Well, you got any money?
- No.

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.505
No wonder you jumped in the river.

01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:36.259
I jumped in the river to save you
so I could get my wings.

01:48:40.097 --> 01:48:42.223
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

01:48:42.308 --> 01:48:47.103
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

01:48:54.987 --> 01:48:57.739
Look, I think maybe you
better not mention

01:48:57.823 --> 01:48:59.199
getting your wings around here.

01:48:59.283 --> 01:49:01.701
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

01:49:04.288 --> 01:49:06.122
Yeah, they believe in them.

01:49:06.207 --> 01:49:09.500
Oh, why should they be surprised
when they see one?

01:49:11.295 --> 01:49:14.547
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

01:49:14.965 --> 01:49:18.968
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three,

01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:22.472
next May.

01:49:23.057 --> 01:49:25.683
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

01:49:25.768 --> 01:49:27.727
Go through the door or out the window.

01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:29.896
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.940
Where do you come off
calling me Nick?

01:49:32.024 --> 01:49:33.524
Well, Nick, that's your name.

01:49:33.609 --> 01:49:37.737
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:40.698
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.

01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:47.747
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

01:49:54.838 --> 01:49:58.758
Mr. Gower.

01:50:00.386 --> 01:50:02.136
What... What did...

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.931
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

01:50:06.308 --> 01:50:08.434
- Don't you know me?
- No.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.229
No.

01:50:11.313 --> 01:50:12.772
Throw him out. Throw him out.

01:50:12.856 --> 01:50:14.857
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

01:50:16.026 --> 01:50:18.278
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:20.613
You know, that's another reason
for me not to like you.

01:50:20.698 --> 01:50:24.117
That rum head spent 20 years in jail
for poisoning a kid.

01:50:24.201 --> 01:50:27.078
If you know him,
you must be a jailbird yourself.

01:50:27.162 --> 01:50:29.205
Would you show these gentlemen
to the door?

01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:31.332
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

01:50:36.755 --> 01:50:38.047
Stay out.

01:50:39.216 --> 01:50:41.801
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

01:50:44.471 --> 01:50:46.973
You see, George,
you were not there to stop Gower

01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:48.766
from putting that poison
into the capsules.

01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:52.520
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...

01:50:54.732 --> 01:50:57.150
Hey, what's going on around here?

01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:58.776
What...

01:50:59.903 --> 01:51:02.572
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

01:51:08.454 --> 01:51:10.121
Look, who are you?

01:51:10.372 --> 01:51:12.915
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.251
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

01:51:20.841 --> 01:51:24.093
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?

01:51:24.178 --> 01:51:25.345
No. Of course not.

01:51:25.429 --> 01:51:28.014
Well, then, why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

01:51:28.098 --> 01:51:32.518
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.

01:51:32.603 --> 01:51:36.898
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.

01:51:36.982 --> 01:51:39.650
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.

01:51:39.735 --> 01:51:41.778
There is no George Bailey.

01:51:42.905 --> 01:51:47.241
You have no papers, no cards,
no driver's license,

01:51:47.659 --> 01:51:50.411
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

01:51:51.413 --> 01:51:53.414
They're not there, either.

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:56.959
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:05.176
You've been given a great gift, George,

01:52:05.344 --> 01:52:08.971
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:13.935
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

01:52:15.813 --> 01:52:19.148
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:21.109
So long, mister. I'm going home.

01:52:21.193 --> 01:52:24.070
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!

01:52:24.571 --> 01:52:28.616
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.

01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:31.744
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.

01:52:31.829 --> 01:52:33.746
I'm going home
and see my wife and family.

01:52:33.831 --> 01:52:36.999
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.

01:52:39.378 --> 01:52:41.295
How am I doing, Joseph?

01:52:42.005 --> 01:52:43.214
Thanks.

01:52:43.549 --> 01:52:45.633
No, I didn't have a drink.

01:53:36.852 --> 01:53:39.395
Hey, hey, where did
the Building and Loan move to?

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.480
Building and what?

01:53:40.564 --> 01:53:42.315
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.

01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:44.275
They went out of business years ago.

01:53:44.359 --> 01:53:45.735
That sailor's a liar!

01:53:45.819 --> 01:53:48.112
I know every big shot in this town!

01:53:48.197 --> 01:53:50.740
I know Potter,
and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:52.283
Hey, Violet!

01:53:53.494 --> 01:53:56.078
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

01:53:56.163 --> 01:53:58.289
- I know.
- I know that girl!

01:53:58.373 --> 01:54:00.166
Take a walk. Beat it.

01:54:02.169 --> 01:54:03.920
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

01:54:06.089 --> 01:54:08.007
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.

01:54:08.091 --> 01:54:09.091
Where do you live?

01:54:09.176 --> 01:54:11.260
Now, doggone it, Ernie,
don't you start pulling that stuff.

01:54:11.345 --> 01:54:13.846
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.

01:54:13.931 --> 01:54:17.391
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

01:54:17.476 --> 01:54:19.310
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

01:54:19.937 --> 01:54:21.979
Come on, Ernie,
now straighten me out here.

01:54:22.064 --> 01:54:25.066
Look, I've got some bad liquor
or something. Listen to me.

01:54:25.150 --> 01:54:26.359
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

01:54:26.443 --> 01:54:28.194
and you live in Bailey Park
with your wife and kid?

01:54:28.278 --> 01:54:30.321
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?

01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:33.658
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.

01:54:33.742 --> 01:54:36.536
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.663
my wife ran away three years ago
and took the kid,

01:54:38.747 --> 01:54:41.207
and I ain't never seen you
before in my life, see?

01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:44.085
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!

01:55:01.603 --> 01:55:03.896
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.

01:55:03.981 --> 01:55:07.191
Well, this house ain't been lived in
for 20 years.

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.241
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.

01:55:15.325 --> 01:55:18.494
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.

01:55:35.971 --> 01:55:38.180
Mary. Mary!

01:55:41.143 --> 01:55:44.020
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?

01:55:44.479 --> 01:55:47.106
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:48.608
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

01:55:48.692 --> 01:55:50.860
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.

01:55:50.944 --> 01:55:52.528
Come on out here, both of you.

01:55:52.613 --> 01:55:54.947
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.

01:55:55.032 --> 01:55:58.284
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

01:55:58.368 --> 01:56:00.036
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.163
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?

01:56:02.247 --> 01:56:03.748
You were here on my wedding night.

01:56:03.832 --> 01:56:05.458
You, both of you,
stood out there on the porch

01:56:05.542 --> 01:56:07.835
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.

01:56:07.919 --> 01:56:09.253
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

01:56:09.338 --> 01:56:10.463
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

01:56:10.547 --> 01:56:12.506
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.

01:56:12.591 --> 01:56:14.467
Ernie, will you take me over
to my mother's house?

01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:17.011
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.

01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:20.556
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

01:56:21.892 --> 01:56:24.602
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

01:56:26.313 --> 01:56:29.106
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.

01:56:29.232 --> 01:56:32.068
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

01:56:37.866 --> 01:56:41.160
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

01:56:43.914 --> 01:56:45.456
I need a drink.

01:56:45.916 --> 01:56:48.584
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.

01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:59.595
Well?

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:04.058
Mother.

01:57:06.061 --> 01:57:08.104
Mother? What do you want?

01:57:09.272 --> 01:57:11.941
Mother, this is George.

01:57:12.275 --> 01:57:14.068
I thought sure you'd remember me.

01:57:14.152 --> 01:57:15.569
George who?

01:57:15.654 --> 01:57:17.530
If you're looking for a room,
there's no vacancy.

01:57:17.614 --> 01:57:20.950
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.

01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:23.452
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:26.497
Please let me come in,
and keep me here until I get over it.

01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:28.916
Get over what? I don't take in strangers

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.544
unless they're sent here
by somebody I know.

01:57:31.878 --> 01:57:36.882
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

01:57:36.967 --> 01:57:38.676
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.886
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

01:57:40.971 --> 01:57:42.096
It's a lie.

01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:45.057
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

01:57:45.142 --> 01:57:48.018
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

01:57:59.948 --> 01:58:01.615
Strange, isn't it?

01:58:02.075 --> 01:58:04.994
Each man's life
touches so many other lives.

01:58:05.454 --> 01:58:08.414
And when he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

01:58:08.498 --> 01:58:09.665
I've heard of things like this.

01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:11.500
You got me in some kind of a spell
or something.

01:58:11.585 --> 01:58:13.669
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

01:58:13.754 --> 01:58:15.546
I know how, too. I...

01:58:15.964 --> 01:58:17.089
The last man I talked to,

01:58:17.174 --> 01:58:19.341
before all this stuff
started happening to me, was Martini.

01:58:19.426 --> 01:58:20.634
You know where he lives?

01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:23.637
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

01:58:27.225 --> 01:58:31.687
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

01:58:32.564 --> 01:58:35.399
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

01:58:36.193 --> 01:58:39.945
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.

01:58:44.534 --> 01:58:47.536
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

01:58:47.621 --> 01:58:49.497
and was drowned at the age of nine.

01:58:49.581 --> 01:58:51.665
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:53.209
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

01:58:53.293 --> 01:58:55.252
He saved the lives
of every man on that transport.

01:58:55.337 --> 01:58:57.379
Every man on that transport died.

01:58:57.464 --> 01:58:58.798
Harry wasn't there to save them,

01:58:58.882 --> 01:59:01.592
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:16.315
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.

01:59:16.775 --> 01:59:20.861
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:23.447
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?

01:59:24.449 --> 01:59:27.660
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...

01:59:27.744 --> 01:59:30.287
I don't know how you know these things,
but tell me, where is she?

01:59:30.372 --> 01:59:32.331
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

01:59:32.415 --> 01:59:35.417
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

01:59:35.502 --> 01:59:37.837
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?

01:59:37.921 --> 01:59:40.256
She's an old maid. She never married.

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:42.675
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?

01:59:42.759 --> 01:59:45.678
She's just about to close up the library!

01:59:49.558 --> 01:59:52.935
There must be some easier way
for me to get my wings.

02:00:04.447 --> 02:00:15.833
Mary!

02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:18.794
Mary! Mary!

02:00:18.962 --> 02:00:21.714
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

02:00:21.798 --> 02:00:23.132
I don't know you. Let me go!

02:00:23.216 --> 02:00:26.260
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

02:00:26.344 --> 02:00:28.512
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.973
Help me, Mary!

02:00:31.224 --> 02:00:32.850
Mary! Let me go!

02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:34.852
Help! It's a wild man!

02:00:36.104 --> 02:00:38.772
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!

02:00:38.857 --> 02:00:41.442
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

02:00:42.152 --> 02:00:43.485
That's my wife!

02:00:46.031 --> 02:00:47.573
- Mary!
- No, you don't.

02:00:47.657 --> 02:00:48.741
Somebody call the police.

02:00:48.825 --> 02:00:50.159
Somebody hit him on the head
with a bottle.

02:00:50.243 --> 02:00:52.369
You need a straightjacket.

02:00:53.496 --> 02:00:54.788
Clarence!

02:00:55.248 --> 02:00:56.832
Get out of here!

02:00:56.917 --> 02:00:58.167
Clarence!

02:00:59.878 --> 02:01:02.338
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!

02:01:05.467 --> 02:01:06.842
Stand back!

02:01:10.555 --> 02:01:22.316
Clarence!

02:01:27.238 --> 02:01:29.490
Clarence! Clarence!

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.826
Help me, Clarence!

02:01:33.954 --> 02:01:35.371
Get me back!

02:01:36.206 --> 02:01:39.166
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.

02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:41.877
Get me back to my wife and kids.

02:01:42.045 --> 02:01:44.129
Help me, Clarence, please.

02:01:44.631 --> 02:01:49.259
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.

02:01:51.012 --> 02:01:55.015
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.

02:02:04.067 --> 02:02:05.484
Hey, George!

02:02:06.903 --> 02:02:08.070
George!

02:02:09.114 --> 02:02:11.156
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

02:02:11.241 --> 02:02:13.659
Now get out of here, Bert,
or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!

02:02:13.743 --> 02:02:15.494
What the sam hill
are you yelling for, George?

02:02:15.578 --> 02:02:17.079
You...

02:02:18.415 --> 02:02:21.291
George? Bert, do you know me?

02:02:21.626 --> 02:02:23.627
Know you? You kidding?

02:02:23.712 --> 02:02:25.838
I've been looking all over town
trying to find you.

02:02:25.922 --> 02:02:28.882
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

02:02:28.967 --> 02:02:31.218
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

02:02:31.302 --> 02:02:32.803
What did...

02:02:36.683 --> 02:02:39.852
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...

02:02:40.103 --> 02:02:43.188
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

02:02:43.273 --> 02:02:46.191
Bert! What do you know about that?

02:02:46.276 --> 02:02:50.029
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.

02:02:50.447 --> 02:02:53.574
Mary! Mary!

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:04.209
Hello, Bedford Falls!

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:08.589
Merry Christmas!

02:03:08.673 --> 02:03:10.507
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!

02:03:10.592 --> 02:03:12.468
Merry Christmas, George.

02:03:12.552 --> 02:03:14.970
Merry Christmas, movie house!

02:03:15.513 --> 02:03:17.806
Merry Christmas, emporium!

02:03:19.059 --> 02:03:22.770
Merry Christmas,
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

02:03:26.983 --> 02:03:30.569
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

02:03:30.653 --> 02:03:33.363
Happy New Year to you in jail!

02:03:33.448 --> 02:03:35.491
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

02:03:37.077 --> 02:03:40.079
Mary! Mary!

02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:42.873
Mary!

02:03:43.792 --> 02:03:46.627
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?

02:03:46.711 --> 02:03:48.921
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.

02:03:49.005 --> 02:03:50.464
George, I've got a little paper here.

02:03:50.548 --> 02:03:51.840
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

02:03:51.925 --> 02:03:53.592
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

02:03:53.676 --> 02:03:56.053
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?

02:03:56.137 --> 02:03:58.931
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful,
old drafty house.

02:03:59.015 --> 02:04:01.308
Mary! Mary!

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:03.685
Mary.

02:04:04.437 --> 02:04:06.105
Have you seen my wife?

02:04:06.189 --> 02:04:09.066
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

02:04:09.150 --> 02:04:11.193
Kids! Pete!

02:04:15.865 --> 02:04:17.116
Kids! Janie!

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.700
Janie! Tommy!

02:04:20.829 --> 02:04:23.705
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

02:04:24.457 --> 02:04:25.541
Where's your mother?

02:04:25.625 --> 02:04:27.417
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.

02:04:27.502 --> 02:04:29.211
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!

02:04:29.295 --> 02:04:31.839
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?

02:04:31.923 --> 02:04:35.217
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...

02:04:35.885 --> 02:04:37.886
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.

02:04:38.596 --> 02:04:41.765
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:44.059
George, darling. Where have you been?

02:04:44.144 --> 02:04:47.479
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.

02:04:47.564 --> 02:04:50.774
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?

02:04:52.235 --> 02:04:54.361
George, George.

02:04:54.445 --> 02:04:56.363
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

02:04:56.447 --> 02:04:58.448
You've no idea what happened...

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:01.451
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.

02:05:01.536 --> 02:05:02.870
- They're on their way.
- All right.

02:05:02.954 --> 02:05:04.204
Come on.

02:05:06.583 --> 02:05:08.375
Come on in here now.

02:05:09.544 --> 02:05:11.170
Now, you stand right over here
by the tree.

02:05:11.254 --> 02:05:13.505
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.

02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:15.174
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?

02:05:15.592 --> 02:05:16.925
I hear them coming now.

02:05:17.010 --> 02:05:19.428
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.

02:05:19.512 --> 02:05:21.722
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

02:05:21.806 --> 02:05:23.807
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?

02:05:23.892 --> 02:05:27.519
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.

02:05:27.604 --> 02:05:28.854
George.

02:05:30.315 --> 02:05:32.566
Here's everything right here.

02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:37.487
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

02:05:37.572 --> 02:05:39.156
She told some people
you were in trouble,

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.200
and they scattered all over town
collecting money.

02:05:41.284 --> 02:05:42.367
Didn't ask any questions.

02:05:42.452 --> 02:05:44.161
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."

02:05:44.245 --> 02:05:45.954
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.

02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:48.165
...another run on the bank?

02:05:48.249 --> 02:05:50.709
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

02:05:50.793 --> 02:05:52.794
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.

02:05:52.879 --> 02:05:55.047
The line forms on the right.

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:57.049
More coming, George.

02:05:57.133 --> 02:05:59.635
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

02:06:00.678 --> 02:06:02.304
Merry Christmas.

02:06:02.639 --> 02:06:05.057
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.

02:06:05.141 --> 02:06:07.643
Martini! Step right up here.

02:06:08.353 --> 02:06:10.812
I busted the jukebox, too.

02:06:13.983 --> 02:06:15.484
Oh, Mr. Gower!

02:06:17.737 --> 02:06:20.489
I made the rounds
of my charge accounts.

02:06:28.331 --> 02:06:31.375
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.

02:06:31.668 --> 02:06:33.126
Violet Bick.

02:06:33.878 --> 02:06:35.587
Oh, Annie! Annie!

02:06:36.798 --> 02:06:39.091
I've been saving this money
for a divorce,

02:06:39.175 --> 02:06:41.176
if ever I get a husband.

02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:43.637
Merry Christmas.

02:06:45.848 --> 02:06:49.184
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.

02:06:49.269 --> 02:06:51.561
Here's something for you to play with.

02:06:53.064 --> 02:06:56.233
I wouldn't have a roof over my head
if it wasn't for you, George.

02:06:56.317 --> 02:06:59.820
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

02:06:59.904 --> 02:07:02.114
Now, get this, it's from London.

02:07:03.032 --> 02:07:05.617
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

02:07:05.827 --> 02:07:10.122
"My office instructed
to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

02:07:10.206 --> 02:07:13.208
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."

02:07:23.428 --> 02:07:25.887
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

02:07:31.853 --> 02:07:35.564
Hark the herald angels sing

02:07:35.648 --> 02:07:39.943
Glory to the newborn king

02:07:40.028 --> 02:07:44.364
Peace on earth and mercy mild

02:07:44.449 --> 02:07:48.535
God and sinners reconciled

02:07:48.619 --> 02:07:52.956
Joyful, all ye nations rise

02:07:53.041 --> 02:07:57.127
Join the triumph of the skies

02:07:57.211 --> 02:08:01.340
With angelic host proclaim

02:08:01.424 --> 02:08:05.010
Christ is born in Bethlehem

02:08:05.094 --> 02:08:06.595
Harry Bailey!

02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:14.353
George, you old son of a gun.

02:08:14.604 --> 02:08:16.855
Harry. Harry.

02:08:17.106 --> 02:08:18.273
Looks like I got here too late.

02:08:18.358 --> 02:08:20.984
Mary, I got him here from the airport
just as quick as I could.

02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:22.861
The fool flew all the way up here
in a blizzard.

02:08:22.945 --> 02:08:24.696
Harry, how about your banquet
in New York?

02:08:24.781 --> 02:08:27.407
Oh, I left right in the middle of it
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

02:08:27.492 --> 02:08:29.493
Good idea, Ernie. A toast

02:08:29.577 --> 02:08:32.871
to my big brother, George,
the richest man in town!

02:08:34.999 --> 02:08:40.462
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:46.051
And never brought to mind?

02:08:46.135 --> 02:08:47.803
Should auld acquaintance

02:08:50.807 --> 02:08:51.890
Be forgot

02:08:51.974 --> 02:08:56.395
And days of auld lang syne

02:08:56.479 --> 02:08:57.896
Who's that?

02:08:58.981 --> 02:09:02.609
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

02:09:03.403 --> 02:09:04.569
Look, Daddy!

02:09:04.654 --> 02:09:10.033
Teacher says every time a bell rings,
an angel gets his wings.

02:09:10.827 --> 02:09:14.329
That's right.

02:09:15.832 --> 02:09:16.998
Attaboy, Clarence.

02:09:17.083 --> 02:09:19.751
Auld lang syne

02:09:19.836 --> 02:09:25.215
For auld lang syne, my dear

02:09:25.299 --> 02:09:30.512
For auld lang syne

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:36.101
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

02:09:36.185 --> 02:09:41.940
For auld lang syne

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:47.779
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

02:09:47.864 --> 02:09:53.368
For auld lang syne

02:09:54.305 --> 02:10:00.868
