01:03.605 --> 01:04.690
Watch out, Nagy!

01:06.191 --> 01:07.818
Get back on defence, David!

01:41.101 --> 01:42.394
What's the matter?

01:42.519 --> 01:43.854
I'm terrible, Grandpa.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.231
Yes, you are.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.817
Thanks for the encouragement.

01:49.693 --> 01:50.694
Come.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.331
If playing football

02:02.414 --> 02:04.333
meant doing everything
by yourself

02:04.750 --> 02:05.876
you would be the best.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.586
Sure, you want to score
the winning goal

02:09.002 --> 02:10.172
and be the big hero.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.382
Everybody wants
to do that for himself.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.010
But you cannot be the hero

02:15.093 --> 02:16.720
every time
you're playing football.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.556
Maybe you should play tennis.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.058
No! I love football.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.186
Of course you do.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.649
It's a love that never ends.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.401
A love you cannot betray.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.445
When did you know?

02:34.029 --> 02:35.656
How much I loved football?

02:37.783 --> 02:40.953
Well, I must have been
a few years younger than you.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.206
My father took me
to see a match.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.251
He didn't tell me
where we were going.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.003
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.089
And what a surprise.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.175
I'll never forget

02:55.425 --> 02:57.219
going up the steep stairs

02:58.929 --> 03:01.932
and all of a sudden,
I see in front of me

03:02.724 --> 03:06.979
this endless,
bright green field.

03:12.067 --> 03:16.196
I swear, I've never seen
such a bright green in my life.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.202
At my age,
I forget too many things.

03:23.078 --> 03:24.246
Too many to remember.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.790
But I'll never forget
that day...

03:27.708 --> 03:29.835
and the way the field looked...

03:30.419 --> 03:32.171
the way the field smelled.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.674
Some memories stay with you.

03:36.967 --> 03:37.885
They never fade.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.678
They are too important.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.182
Was it different?

03:44.766 --> 03:46.101
Everything was different.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.607
How many footballs
do you have at home now?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.401
Ten, I think.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.861
Ten.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.405
I had only two.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.241
And they were two more
than all my other friends.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.872
Your great grandfather
owned a nice restaurant

04:07.039 --> 04:09.875
where all the local players
came and celebrated.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.837
So, as gifts, sometimes
they give him footballs.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.548
I begged my father day and night

04:17.173 --> 04:19.510
to let me go outside
and play with the ball.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.761
No way.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.679
Not a chance.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.184
They were too rare
and precious.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.064
Owning a ball meant
to be privileged

04:32.231 --> 04:35.025
and my father didn't want
the other boys

04:35.108 --> 04:36.401
getting jealous of me.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.822
I know I wanted to do
everything by myself

04:40.906 --> 04:42.991
but that's
because I thought I could.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.160
Sacrifice, David.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.664
A team can only win

04:48.997 --> 04:50.916
when you set aside your ego

04:51.458 --> 04:52.751
and work for everybody.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.087
Football is the only sport

04:55.379 --> 04:58.090
where a team
that has no chance of winning

04:58.966 --> 05:00.300
can surprise the world.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.221
If only they do what?

05:05.264 --> 05:06.139
Play as a team.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.224
Exactly right.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.767
We were better today.

05:08.851 --> 05:11.186
Yes, you were, but you lost.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.522
The best team doesn't
always win.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.741
And I should know.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.161
Know what, Grandpa?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.876
There's a story
I never told anybody.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.004
Not even your father knows.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.924
Does it have to do
with football?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.303
Yes, it does.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.638
That's why
I want you to hear it.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.474
It's time.

06:11.246 --> 06:16.585
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six

06:17.085 --> 06:22.007
five, four, three, two, one!

06:22.299 --> 06:24.676
Happy New Year!

07:04.925 --> 07:05.843
Branko.

07:16.937 --> 07:17.938
Yes, sir.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.398
Do you know who this is?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.733
Yes, sir. That's Laszlo Horvath

07:21.817 --> 07:23.193
and the team
that beat the Nazis...

07:23.277 --> 07:24.945
Shh! Yes, yes. That's right.

07:25.404 --> 07:28.782
Now, your only duty today
is to make sure

07:29.199 --> 07:31.410
that their glasses
are never empty.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.245
Yes, sir.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.413
Here. Just go.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.923
Compliments
of the maÃ®tre d', Mr Horvath.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.302
Aren't you too young
to be serving alcohol?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.263
Yes, sir. But I'm only
serving it, not drinking it.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.223
Soon enough, you will know
why it makes everything

07:53.307 --> 07:54.433
and everyone much more fun.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.351
Don't believe anything
he's trying to tell you.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.187
Either he is lying
or trying to corrupt you.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.191
I just told the kid he's too
young to be serving alcohol.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.443
Well, in a minute,
he'll be offering you a drink.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.403
So scram, kid,
if you wanna save yourself.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.821
- I will, sir.
- No, no, no.

08:07.905 --> 08:08.906
Wait a second.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.283
Come, come closer.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.534
Um... I'm s...

08:12.659 --> 08:13.994
Come, come. For you.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.538
- I'm sorry, Mr Horvath.
- Laszlo.

08:16.788 --> 08:21.126
Mr Laszlo, I don't think
my father will approve.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.295
You know...

08:26.465 --> 08:27.549
You deserve it...

08:32.554 --> 08:33.764
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:33.931 --> 08:37.017
Cheers! Happy New Year!

08:42.981 --> 08:43.899
I see what I like.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.448
Wish me luck.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.367
I will, as always.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.547
I'm Laszlo Horvath.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.423
Nice to meet you.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.018
You never were the shy one.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.396
A man can never have enough
of two things in life.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.814
With you, of all people

09:24.022 --> 09:25.649
I always thought
limiting yourself

09:25.732 --> 09:27.067
to just two things is a sin.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.443
Besides...

09:28.527 --> 09:31.238
the beautiful sight
in this place

09:31.363 --> 09:34.116
has clearly taken
a fancy to you.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.455
On the contrary,
the opposite side seems to be

09:40.831 --> 09:43.292
paying an even closer attention
to your every move.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.294
I thought I told my mother
not to come here.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.545
The Nazis...

09:47.087 --> 09:49.923
You have
their undivided attention.

09:50.716 --> 09:51.592
Well done.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.430
So what? I care enough
to stare right back.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.183
Are you deliberately trying
to provoke them?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.269
You know what happens to them
who stare at the devil?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.522
Even this devil is nothing
but flesh and bone.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.275
They don't think they are.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.110
Well, that's
their Achilles heel, not mine.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.236
Yours is vanity.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.654
Just be careful.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.948
There's a lot of them
in here and out there.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.826
Please. I'm begging you.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.328
Do me a favour.

10:19.745 --> 10:20.704
Stop it.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.498
Please.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.712
You're a famous man, Mr...

10:29.338 --> 10:30.506
Laszlo.

10:30.923 --> 10:31.924
That's the name.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.384
Laszlo Horvath.

10:35.761 --> 10:36.803
We all had a bet

10:37.095 --> 10:38.555
if you were indeed
the famous player

10:38.639 --> 10:39.640
everyone remembers.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.642
Did you win the bet?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.603
- Yes, indeed.
- Good.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.480
Because just a few years ago

10:46.605 --> 10:48.190
you guys didn't fare so well.

10:49.775 --> 10:50.776
Please...

10:51.276 --> 10:52.319
do not remind me.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.321
You and your men
were fortunate enough

10:54.613 --> 10:56.198
to beat the Nazi team
three to two.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.909
But this was
seven long years ago.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.870
We are much better now.

11:01.995 --> 11:02.996
I can see.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.167
Soon enough,
all of Europe will be Nazis

11:07.751 --> 11:09.962
so you can play against
yourself, which is great.

11:10.546 --> 11:14.383
That way you can prevent
yourself from ever losing again.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.388
May I suggest a small wager?

11:20.973 --> 11:23.183
My fellow men and I have
a proposition for you.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.395
Considering you were a part
of a team that beat the Nazis...

11:27.646 --> 11:30.524
we would like an opportunity
to get back a little bit of...

11:30.941 --> 11:32.067
how would you say...

11:33.277 --> 11:34.236
pride.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.030
Whoever manages
to bounce the ball in the air

11:37.114 --> 11:38.991
between two people the longest

11:39.283 --> 11:41.577
without it falling
to the ground, wins.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.372
Loser pays the winner food,
drinks, anything

11:45.747 --> 11:46.832
for the entire evening.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.294
I insist, Mr Laszlo.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.713
You know what?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.756
I'm a little bit confused.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.259
I thought pride is
what you were waging?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.014
Very well.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.893
You win, and we will pay

12:05.976 --> 12:08.562
whatever you
and your men wish to consume

12:09.438 --> 12:13.025
and if we win,
pride is what we will take.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.193
Pride is not won.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.195
It is earned.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.531
And besides,
that's not too much of a wager

12:20.824 --> 12:22.910
since everything at our table,
as you can see

12:23.535 --> 12:24.745
is already on the house.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.706
Maybe you have
another suggestion, then?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.166
As a matter of fact, I do.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.418
You...

12:31.835 --> 12:33.879
your fellow men, your army...

12:34.213 --> 12:35.130
all of you...

12:35.547 --> 12:36.924
leave Budapest tonight.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.885
And never come back, ever again.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.224
Mr Laszlo

12:45.599 --> 12:46.975
even if you were to win

12:48.894 --> 12:51.897
I am not sure
you would want this to happen.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.446
It was worth a shot.

13:01.865 --> 13:02.783
I insist.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.546
If I could have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:18.674 --> 13:19.675
Thank you.

13:24.263 --> 13:27.391
The famous Laszlo Horvath and I

13:28.058 --> 13:30.602
have come to terms
on a bit of a fun wager.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.897
The only thing we need
to complete this wager...

13:35.315 --> 13:36.191
is a ball.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.486
Does anyone here know
where to find one?

13:44.366 --> 13:45.701
I can't even remember

13:45.784 --> 13:47.286
what made me raise my hand.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.454
I was so scared.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.458
If I hadn't raised my hand

13:53.792 --> 13:56.378
and gone down to the basement
that New Year's Eve

13:57.129 --> 13:58.630
things would have been
different.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.674
Much different.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.053
But my God...

14:06.763 --> 14:09.391
they must have bounced
that ball between them

14:10.267 --> 14:11.685
a good five minutes.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.343
I was amazed.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.222
Everybody was amazed.

15:16.124 --> 15:17.584
Congratulations, Mr Laszlo.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.878
Fortunate, as you were in '36.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.719
Fortune takes a back seat
when you have those two men.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.012
Gentlemen, please.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.727
After me,
probably the best two players

15:35.811 --> 15:36.979
your eyes will ever see.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.064
And let me tell you
a little secret.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.567
Even when drunk

15:41.692 --> 15:43.485
they're still better
than any men

15:43.735 --> 15:44.820
you put against them.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.114
Cheers.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.204
Another toast.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.290
- Already?
- One more drink.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.125
I insist, Mr Laszlo.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.586
To the Third Reich.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.090
To empires.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.593
From Romans in 476

16:07.676 --> 16:09.595
right down to the Ottomans

16:10.846 --> 16:12.097
in 1924.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.766
You do know your history,
Mr Laszlo.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.686
You know what all those empires
have in common?

16:17.936 --> 16:18.979
Please tell me.

16:19.730 --> 16:20.689
Our history.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.233
The history we are about to make

16:23.609 --> 16:27.196
will be written by the winners
living in our times.

16:27.446 --> 16:29.031
- Come on, let's go.
- I hear it's pretty cold

16:29.114 --> 16:30.324
up there in Russia.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.035
I suggest you pack warmly.

16:33.619 --> 16:36.622
Gentlemen, I think we should
better call it a night.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.598
Hurry.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.731
You were
a great football player.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.483
Nobody knows that
better than me.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.406
Things have changed. Accept it.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.188
Branko! Branko!

17:44.022 --> 17:45.816
But, sir! That man! He is hurt!

17:59.371 --> 18:00.664
Did you ever see him again?

18:01.456 --> 18:02.541
Mr Laszlo?

18:03.917 --> 18:04.835
Yes.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.255
Not a day that goes by
that I don't think of him.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.341
He was and still is

18:11.466 --> 18:13.886
the reason why I'm here,
telling you this story.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.932
Mr Laszlo.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.730
I haven't said his name
like that since then.

18:40.412 --> 18:43.624
Horvath! If you're not outside
in less than ten seconds

18:43.749 --> 18:45.250
they will drag you out by force.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.130
This is not the time
or place to be defiant.

18:51.965 --> 18:52.883
Come outside.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.385
Immediately.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.980
That would not be a wise move.

19:07.481 --> 19:08.815
You have five seconds to line up

19:08.899 --> 19:10.400
with the rest
of your friends here.

19:11.902 --> 19:12.945
Five...

19:14.154 --> 19:15.072
four...

19:16.657 --> 19:17.616
three...

19:20.285 --> 19:21.203
two...

19:22.871 --> 19:24.122
and... one.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.678
You here are the privileged ones

19:38.053 --> 19:40.389
but never forget
that you are all expendable.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.725
It's up to each and every one
of you to decide your fate.

19:44.601 --> 19:45.602
Now, get to work.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.575
Give me a hand.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.169
I recognise you now.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.506
You won't remember me,
but I remember you.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.717
Played against you in '42

20:18.051 --> 20:19.928
when I was a member
of the regional team.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.432
Name's Karolyi. Karolyi Faraco.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.977
I was a defensive midfielder.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.896
You scored four goals
in that game.

20:30.606 --> 20:32.983
The scoring drive
you made in the second half

20:33.483 --> 20:35.569
I can't remember
seeing anyone do that since.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.571
You were an artist out there.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.365
Combination of artist
and a magician.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.242
The flair of Michelangelo

20:42.326 --> 20:43.911
and the nerves of steel
of Houdini.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.916
Our Hungary, it stopped being
a country a while ago.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.252
Even the government
is just a puppet of the Nazis.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.757
So now they're arresting anyone
they consider a threat.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.091
Intellectuals.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.887
Undesirables.
Supposed "dissidents" like me.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.306
For whatever reason, now you.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.434
Work us hard every day

21:07.726 --> 21:09.770
till even our souls begin
to feel tired.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.189
Why are you complaining?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.025
Aren't we the "privileged ones"?

21:15.817 --> 21:16.860
At least we're still alive.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.363
Alive enough
to be worked to death.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.531
Speak for yourself.

21:21.031 --> 21:23.116
But don't drag others
into that abyss with you.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.619
We've heard stories,
what happens to other camps.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.371
So even if we are
being worked to death

21:27.454 --> 21:29.331
I'd take it any day
over dying in a gas chamber.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.674
Who knows
what makes a man like that tick?

21:39.716 --> 21:41.009
You ever see him play, Jakob?

21:41.093 --> 21:43.303
See? I was in the stands
when he scored the goal

21:43.387 --> 21:44.263
that beat the Nazis.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.848
Such a great player
on the field.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.642
Good at sports, bad at life.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.060
I'd rather be good at life

21:50.143 --> 21:51.770
than a world champion
in any sport.

21:51.979 --> 21:52.938
Ah.

21:53.605 --> 21:54.523
Tibor.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.066
Any news?

21:56.567 --> 21:58.527
I heard a rumour
that the Nazis are losing ground

21:58.777 --> 22:00.612
in the East.
The whispers might be true.

22:01.071 --> 22:04.741
My father always taught me
that a beast is most dangerous

22:04.825 --> 22:05.742
when it is hurt.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.953
And your father, is he safe?

22:09.997 --> 22:11.081
They separated us.

22:12.249 --> 22:15.335
My wife, son,
mother, father, sister.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.714
We had a nice bakery, you know.

22:18.797 --> 22:19.882
Best one in town.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.842
When it all began,
it came so quickly.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.011
All the people
that used to come to our shop

22:24.094 --> 22:25.679
they no longer wanted
to help us.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.516
When you need help
the most, they disappoint.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.268
It's the law of survival.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.561
No!

22:33.520 --> 22:36.231
It's the law
of selfishness, of not caring.

22:36.315 --> 22:37.524
Do you think that he cares?

22:39.776 --> 22:41.987
From the looks of it,
I think he stopped caring

22:42.070 --> 22:43.113
a long time ago.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.034
My first days here
were unbearable.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.036
Time stretched on

22:49.119 --> 22:52.080
where I didn't know
what day or month it was.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.668
You know, you think
you'll spend this life learning

22:56.960 --> 22:58.462
reading, loving.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.547
And now, every moment here

23:00.631 --> 23:03.592
is spent just surviving
for the sake of survival.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.345
And you ask yourself,
"What am I surviving for?"

23:06.845 --> 23:08.430
What will be left
out there of the world

23:08.514 --> 23:10.849
if this madness ever ends?

23:11.058 --> 23:13.310
Even when I was overseeing
construction in Gyor

23:14.061 --> 23:15.771
I never worked crews this hard.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.731
They want us to die.

23:20.609 --> 23:21.652
Hands of a baker.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.197
Should be covered
in sugar and flour

23:25.280 --> 23:26.823
not hard, ugly blisters.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.953
Good baker must be able to sense
the dough with his fingers.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.545
His name is Tomasz.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.171
That's about all we know.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.674
Not even the other gypsies
know anything about him.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.634
He doesn't speak.

23:45.884 --> 23:48.011
The Nazis, just for spite

23:48.971 --> 23:50.639
give him more food
than to the rest of us.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.183
I think it's because they want
to keep us on edge.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.478
I am Yanko.

23:59.273 --> 24:00.732
You really think
they will have any use

24:01.066 --> 24:02.818
for the things
we're building for them?

24:02.943 --> 24:05.320
Of course.
One thing they're not is stupid.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.365
All things being considered,
we here, we are the lucky ones.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.368
Some are being sent to
the battlefield near the front.

24:12.578 --> 24:13.912
We heard stories
that they use them

24:13.996 --> 24:15.289
to clear the minefields

24:15.372 --> 24:16.790
by making them march across.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.087
I know why we are here.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.965
Why would a famous Hungarian
like you

24:25.674 --> 24:27.342
be sent to this miserable place?

25:50.884 --> 25:52.261
...and Colonel Franz Woerns,

25:52.386 --> 25:54.388
the Nazi Regional Commander
of all of the camps,

25:54.471 --> 25:57.099
has honoured us by making
our camp his headquarters.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.310
For your information,
Colonel Woerns reports directly

26:00.394 --> 26:01.478
to General Ziege

26:01.603 --> 26:03.438
the Nazi commandant
of the entire region.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.240
Carry on.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.868
- What is the count?
- Twenty nine, sir.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.996
- How many?
- Twenty nine, sir.

26:23.959 --> 26:25.335
Bring that fool outside. Now.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.379
Now!

26:27.671 --> 26:28.672
May God help him.

26:41.018 --> 26:42.978
Everyone manages
to follow the rules.

26:43.187 --> 26:44.479
Yet you choose
to be the only one

26:44.605 --> 26:46.315
to put
all the other men here at risk

26:46.398 --> 26:47.524
by being disobedient.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.320
Isn't it bad enough
your behaviour

26:51.403 --> 26:53.488
is the reason Andreas
is in the hospital? Huh?

26:59.161 --> 27:01.163
Stand up! This instant!

27:02.164 --> 27:03.999
Henkel. Enough, already.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.502
Are you not aware
who this man is you are beating?

27:07.544 --> 27:09.421
This is Horvath the Great.

27:09.838 --> 27:12.633
Greatest Hungarian to ever play
the game of football.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.635
It's good
to see you again, Laszlo.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.721
I still remember that free kick.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.432
The one that won
the gold medal game against us.

27:20.641 --> 27:24.019
That was right after I fouled
you at midfield, remember?

27:24.353 --> 27:27.105
I only remember that Nazis lost.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.858
You and I must talk.
Bring him to my office.

27:31.151 --> 27:34.196
But Colonel, I do not think
this is a very good idea.

27:34.571 --> 27:36.823
Even if he is
a famous football player.

27:37.574 --> 27:38.825
It doesn't mean
that he has the right

27:38.951 --> 27:41.620
to defy our authority
time and time again.

27:43.789 --> 27:47.000
I will see this man
in my office.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.426
Laszlo was too crazy

27:56.510 --> 27:57.928
to live an ordinary life.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.514
He would play life
the way he would play football.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.475
Fast, relentless, unafraid.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.688
He would fight anybody
at any time

28:07.938 --> 28:09.106
without thinking twice.

28:10.315 --> 28:11.775
If he saw a tornado coming

28:12.484 --> 28:13.986
he would go straight for it

28:14.278 --> 28:16.446
and shout
"Give me your best shot".

28:20.200 --> 28:21.952
Some people live just to get by

28:23.078 --> 28:24.079
but not Laszlo.

28:25.539 --> 28:29.126
He lived his way for as long
as life would let him.

28:30.419 --> 28:32.838
If life was a game of football

28:33.714 --> 28:36.592
Laszlo would play each
of the ninety minutes

28:37.467 --> 28:39.678
as if they were
his first and last.

28:45.851 --> 28:49.521
You always were different,
Horvath.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.359
Everyone stared at you
when you played

28:54.484 --> 28:56.195
afraid to miss
the next great move

28:56.278 --> 28:57.571
you were about to make.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.992
I have to admit to you
that we, as the Nazis

29:02.868 --> 29:04.870
were always quite jealous.

29:06.330 --> 29:08.040
But let's not share
that with anyone.

29:28.894 --> 29:31.104
Lt Henkel would have surely
killed you out there today

29:31.188 --> 29:32.481
if I did not intervene.

29:33.524 --> 29:35.734
You can pound your chest

29:35.817 --> 29:37.236
like a gorilla in a jungle

29:37.861 --> 29:39.988
but even you might tremble

29:40.531 --> 29:43.033
if suddenly the barrel of a gun
was pointed to your face.

29:43.367 --> 29:44.868
You guys wouldn't do that.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.495
You are certain?

29:46.787 --> 29:49.248
Yes, you would shoot me
in the temple.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.376
So that I couldn't see
what was coming.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.379
The element of surprise,
of course.

29:57.548 --> 29:58.924
To you, maybe it is surprise.

29:59.842 --> 30:01.009
To me, it's a...

30:02.052 --> 30:03.512
desperate move of a coward.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.306
Always you were such
a funny one.

30:07.432 --> 30:08.433
Now...

30:09.226 --> 30:10.269
seeing you today

30:11.728 --> 30:14.690
has given me
an extraordinary idea.

30:17.192 --> 30:20.112
So, in less than two months,
it is the FÃ¼hrer's birthday.

30:20.529 --> 30:21.822
April 20th, to be exact.

30:22.865 --> 30:25.659
I would like to arrange a game.

30:29.121 --> 30:30.831
A football match between you

30:31.123 --> 30:32.958
and the men at the camp
against the Nazi team.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.252
To commemorate
such a momentous occasion.

30:35.752 --> 30:36.795
You can't be serious.

30:37.754 --> 30:40.132
I am not like you Laszlo,
I don't make jokes.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.884
This is an opportunity
for all of us.

30:42.384 --> 30:43.427
Us?

30:44.595 --> 30:47.222
- Who are "we"?
- You, me, the men at the camp.

30:47.306 --> 30:50.017
The men in this camp are
barely given anything to eat.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.853
They're in no condition to play.

30:53.145 --> 30:55.606
This is a chance.

30:57.399 --> 30:59.943
A real chance to play
a game that you love

31:00.652 --> 31:02.571
and at which you are truly
one of the best.

31:02.988 --> 31:04.948
You will be a winner
just by playing, Laszlo.

31:05.616 --> 31:08.869
You could think of it
as a friendly exhibition match.

31:09.703 --> 31:11.496
You would display your skills.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.791
A tribute
to the beautiful game...

31:16.043 --> 31:18.378
and something special
for the men at the camp.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.715
In a way,
something special for me too.

31:22.341 --> 31:24.593
It does remind me
of an old saying...

31:27.304 --> 31:29.681
"Beware of the wolf
in sheep's clothing."

31:30.182 --> 31:31.183
Laszlo...

31:31.767 --> 31:33.936
I am speaking as someone
who wants to help you.

31:35.938 --> 31:37.356
A wolf can spare a sheep

31:37.439 --> 31:39.233
if his appetite has
been satisfied.

31:39.816 --> 31:41.068
I've been under the assumption

31:41.151 --> 31:43.153
that an endless appetite
for everything

31:43.278 --> 31:44.571
anything, anyone...

31:45.572 --> 31:47.324
was the trademark
of the Third Reich.

31:54.289 --> 31:55.499
I'm serious about this.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.546
It's not just up to me.
You're asking for a lot.

32:00.629 --> 32:02.297
Of course, I am.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.842
But I am also offering you
something few are given.

32:06.969 --> 32:09.346
I would have to inform
General Ziege, of course.

32:10.222 --> 32:11.098
He loves football.

32:11.181 --> 32:13.141
I am sure with my blessing,
he would approve.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.445
Oh, there's one, uh...

32:26.363 --> 32:27.406
last tiny detail.

32:28.866 --> 32:30.242
Your feet may have
made you a hero

32:30.325 --> 32:31.410
to your fellow countrymen

32:31.493 --> 32:33.203
but your mouth
will get you killed.

32:36.164 --> 32:38.292
Next time, fortune might not be
on your side

32:38.667 --> 32:41.295
as me saving you
from yourself this morning.

32:43.422 --> 32:44.798
I would not count on
that good fortune

32:44.882 --> 32:46.049
if you were to say "no" to me.

32:48.594 --> 32:49.803
And my suggestion is...

32:50.762 --> 32:54.308
to take my offer as a gift.

32:55.559 --> 32:56.643
That will be all.

33:03.859 --> 33:05.485
We had an interesting talk.

33:06.445 --> 33:07.404
Talk?

33:08.155 --> 33:10.991
Nazis don't talk. They take.
They order. They kill.

33:12.075 --> 33:14.536
The one thing about the Nazis

33:15.621 --> 33:18.624
is that their memory
of a loss never fades.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.293
So that's all you talked about?

33:21.502 --> 33:22.753
How you beat them once?

33:23.337 --> 33:25.005
No, not entirely.

33:27.508 --> 33:28.717
He wants us to play.

33:29.259 --> 33:30.302
A game.

33:30.594 --> 33:32.721
A game? What kind of game?

33:33.055 --> 33:35.474
A match. Football match.

33:35.849 --> 33:36.808
Against whom?

33:37.851 --> 33:39.728
Against Nazi team.

33:40.312 --> 33:41.480
On Hitler's birthday.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.609
Is this some kind
of cruel joke?

33:45.817 --> 33:46.818
Franz was serious.

33:47.569 --> 33:48.487
So am I.

33:48.862 --> 33:50.489
But how could we play
a football match?

33:50.781 --> 33:52.741
If we all tried running
for five minutes

33:52.824 --> 33:54.326
we'd faint, and this isn't five.

33:54.493 --> 33:57.120
He's right. We don't
have the strength or stamina.

34:03.502 --> 34:04.920
Maybe this is our one chance.

34:06.630 --> 34:08.257
Don't forget,
every chance of failure

34:08.340 --> 34:10.300
also presents a chance
to succeed.

34:11.385 --> 34:13.846
However, any inaction
resulting from fear

34:14.221 --> 34:15.304
guarantees failure.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.393
If all of you think
we should play

34:20.768 --> 34:22.103
then that is what we'll do.

34:22.896 --> 34:26.942
No team can win
unless there's team unity.

34:32.072 --> 34:33.114
Now, who wants to play?

34:45.002 --> 34:46.295
Conditions must be met.

34:48.755 --> 34:49.882
We'd need better food.

34:50.632 --> 34:52.551
Time to train,
build a real team.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.136
Very good.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.388
Then you and I
will ask for these conditions.

34:57.264 --> 34:58.891
"You and I",
what do you mean "You and I"?

34:59.057 --> 35:00.976
Since you and Andreas were
former members

35:01.059 --> 35:02.144
of the regional team

35:02.227 --> 35:03.729
and Andreas is unavailable

35:04.605 --> 35:06.732
that makes you the co-captain.

35:06.815 --> 35:07.858
Welcome aboard.

35:09.693 --> 35:10.861
...twenty six...

35:11.695 --> 35:12.696
twenty seven...

35:13.864 --> 35:14.948
twenty eight...

35:15.616 --> 35:16.575
twenty nine...

35:17.409 --> 35:18.327
thirty.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.204
So good to see you, Mr Horvath.

35:21.288 --> 35:22.372
Very punctual.

35:23.582 --> 35:24.499
As I understand

35:24.583 --> 35:26.585
Colonel Franz is expecting you
this morning.

35:30.881 --> 35:32.591
Please understand
that I don't give a damn

35:32.674 --> 35:34.593
about who you are
or what you used to be.

35:37.346 --> 35:39.014
Karolyi, let's go.

35:44.019 --> 35:47.814
"Cello Suite No. 1 in
G Major, Prelude" by J. S. Bach

36:02.913 --> 36:03.914
Come in.

36:08.502 --> 36:10.254
Ah, Laszlo.

36:11.338 --> 36:12.631
So good to see you again.

36:14.174 --> 36:15.259
Welcome.

36:17.469 --> 36:18.804
So, who is this?

36:19.012 --> 36:20.889
This is Karolyi Faraco.

36:21.849 --> 36:23.809
He represents men in this camp.

36:24.059 --> 36:24.977
Please, sit.

36:30.566 --> 36:34.945
So gentlemen,
I have excellent news.

36:35.112 --> 36:38.198
General Ziege is very excited
about the idea of a match.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.200
And in fact,
he has asked to personally

36:40.284 --> 36:41.994
be given progress reports.

36:42.953 --> 36:45.247
We are also very excited, but...

36:47.374 --> 36:49.960
this does depend on
certain things we would require.

36:52.462 --> 36:53.589
Such as?

36:54.173 --> 36:56.258
Food. Real food.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.927
Larger portions
for every man in this camp.

37:03.932 --> 37:04.933
Go on.

37:05.559 --> 37:06.560
The team itself.

37:07.936 --> 37:09.771
I need to search
other nearby camps.

37:10.022 --> 37:11.481
I doubt you'll find anyone.

37:11.815 --> 37:13.483
If you're allowed to pick
whoever you want

37:13.567 --> 37:14.776
in all of the Third Reich

37:14.860 --> 37:17.112
then I should be allowed to pick

37:17.196 --> 37:19.239
the best available players
from nearby camps.

37:20.324 --> 37:21.283
Hmm.

37:22.618 --> 37:23.577
What else?

37:24.745 --> 37:27.831
We cannot train and work
at the same time.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.166
I hope you understand that.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.085
In order for us
to look like a team

37:32.169 --> 37:33.837
we have to train like one

37:33.921 --> 37:35.881
so until the match is played

37:36.965 --> 37:37.841
we don't work.

37:38.592 --> 37:39.510
We train.

37:42.012 --> 37:42.888
Is that all?

37:45.015 --> 37:45.891
Karolyi?

37:50.103 --> 37:51.980
One hour every three weeks

37:52.814 --> 37:54.691
to write letters
to our loved ones.

37:54.900 --> 37:58.529
And mail delivery
to us twice a week.

38:05.661 --> 38:07.746
I must regrettably inform you

38:07.829 --> 38:10.832
that all your requests
cannot be granted.

38:13.669 --> 38:16.463
The food situation can be
improved, perhaps.

38:17.297 --> 38:19.466
I'll consider the mail issue.

38:21.218 --> 38:24.304
But you still are prisoners
inside this labour camp

38:24.388 --> 38:26.473
and by definition, you will work
and come up with a team

38:26.557 --> 38:27.850
from the men you have here.

38:29.768 --> 38:31.353
- Is that definite?
- Absolutely.

38:32.688 --> 38:34.815
Then please inform General Ziege

38:35.399 --> 38:36.525
we cannot play this match.

38:37.693 --> 38:38.819
Karolyi, let's go.

38:50.664 --> 38:52.249
You just walked out
on a Nazi colonel.

38:52.332 --> 38:54.585
- Halt!
- Trust me. I know the Nazis.

38:55.169 --> 38:58.630
He wants to play a game
before the real game? So be it.

38:59.464 --> 39:01.300
Is that game called
who gets shot first?

39:01.633 --> 39:02.843
If it is,
please don't put me in.

39:02.926 --> 39:05.637
Halt! The colonel
ordered both of you to halt!

39:24.364 --> 39:25.490
He's playing a game.

39:26.825 --> 39:27.993
He's playing a game.

39:32.372 --> 39:33.498
Gentlemen...

39:34.416 --> 39:36.877
our talk wasn't quite over.

39:38.003 --> 39:40.130
Please see to it
that you follow me inside.

39:43.800 --> 39:44.885
Go!

39:46.678 --> 39:47.596
Now!

39:49.431 --> 39:53.268
Please tell me that you knew
he was going to miss.

40:04.613 --> 40:07.282
Let us have
a mutually-satisfying conclusion

40:07.366 --> 40:08.492
to our meeting. Yes?

40:12.120 --> 40:13.956
I have reconsidered
your requests

40:14.665 --> 40:16.416
and I am willing to increase
the quality

40:16.625 --> 40:18.001
and double the food portions.

40:18.544 --> 40:19.586
When it comes to work

40:19.753 --> 40:21.463
the men will work
in the mornings

40:21.797 --> 40:23.841
and train in the afternoons.

40:24.132 --> 40:25.801
The letters. We insist.

40:25.884 --> 40:26.844
Yes.

40:27.928 --> 40:30.556
The prisoners will have enough
time to write and receive mail.

40:31.181 --> 40:32.724
- You may visit three camps...
- Five.

40:32.808 --> 40:33.851
Four.

40:34.017 --> 40:35.727
I will pick the very
best fifteen players.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.063
A match is played
with 11 men on the field

40:38.146 --> 40:39.481
the last time I counted.

40:39.565 --> 40:41.900
I'm being generous
when I request 15

40:42.776 --> 40:45.028
as these men can barely walk,
let alone run.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.030
I must have reserves.

40:47.114 --> 40:49.658
What if someone gets injured,
like Andreas?

40:50.409 --> 40:52.244
This is quite enough.

40:53.203 --> 40:56.081
Thirteen players,
not counting Andreas.

40:56.915 --> 40:59.001
I will see to it that
what we agreed today

40:59.459 --> 41:00.419
is put in writing.

41:01.962 --> 41:03.088
But remember...

41:04.381 --> 41:07.426
you, and you alone,
are responsible

41:07.509 --> 41:10.304
if anything goes wrong with
any man on the team you choose.

41:11.430 --> 41:14.391
The match is exactly
36 days away.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.604
This will give you plenty
of time to prepare.

41:20.981 --> 41:23.400
Oh, Laszlo. One last thing.

41:27.404 --> 41:28.405
Good luck.

41:34.995 --> 41:35.954
How did you know?

41:36.955 --> 41:39.541
The moment he said
General Ziege was excited

41:39.625 --> 41:41.126
I knew he could not back down.

41:42.878 --> 41:44.213
It's Hitler's birthday

41:44.296 --> 41:46.089
and if everything goes nice
and easy for him

41:46.173 --> 41:47.299
then he gets promoted.

41:47.841 --> 41:49.009
Let's go find our team.

41:55.849 --> 41:58.769
I can only pick an additional
11 men for the team.

42:00.312 --> 42:03.023
Whoever plays will get
shorter workdays

42:03.607 --> 42:05.442
but training will be intense.

42:06.652 --> 42:08.987
I need you
to be completely honest.

42:09.780 --> 42:11.782
Who here can play football?

42:19.331 --> 42:20.499
Be honest.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.847
Alright. Jakob.

43:00.497 --> 43:02.916
Good. I'm impressed.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.419
Tibor, you're next.

43:46.752 --> 43:48.337
There's hopelessness
all around us

43:48.462 --> 43:51.423
but here, tonight,
there is hope for Hungary.

43:54.176 --> 43:56.136
Tomorrow, we will find
the rest of our team.

43:56.887 --> 43:58.472
And we'll start
to work right away.

44:00.307 --> 44:02.476
They didn't look
like a team just yet.

44:03.018 --> 44:03.936
Who could?

44:04.394 --> 44:05.938
Conditions were terrible.

44:06.396 --> 44:08.190
Nobody was thinking
about football.

44:08.690 --> 44:11.109
Football was a means
of survival.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.416
Word spread to other camps

44:26.500 --> 44:28.961
that whoever was lucky enough
to be chosen

44:29.127 --> 44:31.171
they would be sent to a camp
with better conditions.

44:35.384 --> 44:36.343
Everyone!

44:37.719 --> 44:39.054
Who here can play football?

44:40.138 --> 44:41.223
Naturally

44:41.431 --> 44:43.308
everybody became
a football player.

44:55.070 --> 44:56.613
Some of them were quite good.

44:59.950 --> 45:00.993
Some others...

45:03.328 --> 45:05.080
well, they did their best.

45:25.475 --> 45:26.935
Come on, Laszlo, let's go.

45:30.522 --> 45:33.317
You know what happens
to them who stare at the devil?

45:33.483 --> 45:36.612
Even this devil is nothing
but flesh and bone.

45:38.238 --> 45:39.531
They don't think they are.

46:32.626 --> 46:33.919
Who's that man over there?

46:36.672 --> 46:38.173
The prisoner's teaching
the violin

46:38.257 --> 46:39.675
to the camp commander.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.760
Can you invite that prisoner
to come over?

46:42.094 --> 46:43.679
I do not think
this will be possible.

46:44.054 --> 46:46.098
One does not interrupt
the commander's lesson.

46:47.432 --> 46:49.476
Then please inform the commander

46:50.102 --> 46:51.520
that interruption of his lesson

46:51.603 --> 46:53.480
comes at the request
of General Ziege.

47:02.030 --> 47:03.574
Laszlo, this is it.

47:03.907 --> 47:04.867
It's the last camp.

47:05.534 --> 47:07.703
We only have one slot left
to fill. What are you doing?

47:07.786 --> 47:09.162
We need players! Good ones.

47:09.246 --> 47:11.623
Why are you wasting our final
choice on a man who's...

47:11.707 --> 47:12.958
playing the violin?

47:13.417 --> 47:14.626
Go, get a ball.

47:20.382 --> 47:22.009
Did you request
to see this prisoner?

47:22.843 --> 47:24.094
That would be correct,
Commander.

47:24.219 --> 47:25.596
- May I ask why?
- We need him.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.016
For what? To play the violin?

47:30.392 --> 47:32.102
No, to play football.

47:32.728 --> 47:33.812
Hmm.

47:34.438 --> 47:37.983
Violin players don't play
football, do they?

47:38.192 --> 47:39.151
Look.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.361
Put down the case.

47:47.743 --> 47:49.578
Yes. We have a goalkeeper.

47:50.078 --> 47:50.996
Great reflexes.

47:54.166 --> 47:55.083
Give it back.

48:00.672 --> 48:02.424
Do you... Do you play football?

48:04.426 --> 48:05.469
That's what I thought.

48:07.387 --> 48:08.847
Then again, if you don't play

48:09.473 --> 48:11.767
that would enable
our beloved Third Reich to win.

48:12.768 --> 48:13.936
Yes, take him, by all means.

48:15.479 --> 48:16.563
But go.

48:17.397 --> 48:19.107
Can someone tell me
what this is all about?

48:19.399 --> 48:22.194
I'm Laszlo. This is Karolyi.
Welcome to our team.

48:22.611 --> 48:24.154
A man entering a camp

48:24.321 --> 48:27.449
holding a football
meant there was hope.

48:29.618 --> 48:34.456
And Laszlo became this hope
for everyone who saw him.

48:35.791 --> 48:36.917
Including me.

48:37.835 --> 48:41.296
And I was the last one
who expected it.

48:47.719 --> 48:49.221
What did I tell you, Branko?

48:53.183 --> 48:54.560
I said "Never let them leave".

49:01.066 --> 49:02.150
What do I do now?

49:03.694 --> 49:06.363
I'm so sorry, sir.
It will never happen again.

49:07.447 --> 49:08.699
But who will get them back?

49:09.116 --> 49:10.534
- I will.
- How?

49:16.373 --> 49:17.332
Come on.

49:18.834 --> 49:20.169
I don't know what it was.

49:20.252 --> 49:23.797
Call it destiny, chance, fate,
a roll of dice.

49:24.089 --> 49:26.550
I've thought about it
countless times.

49:27.092 --> 49:29.428
Why was he there,
in that exact moment?

49:30.095 --> 49:31.597
Go into the truck, wait for me.

49:32.681 --> 49:35.893
A few seconds later
and he wouldn't have seen me.

49:37.102 --> 49:38.353
You always defy me.

49:40.063 --> 49:41.064
It's unacceptable.

49:43.025 --> 49:44.026
Where have they gone?

49:48.280 --> 49:50.407
What? Don't look
at me like I'm stupid.

49:51.825 --> 49:53.202
Like I'm some kind of scum.

49:54.161 --> 49:55.287
You're the scum!

49:55.621 --> 49:57.706
Let's go.
We have what you wanted.

49:58.332 --> 50:00.542
Piece of shit!
You stupid little...

50:02.085 --> 50:03.587
Get up! Get up!

50:05.547 --> 50:06.840
That's not our fight.

50:07.132 --> 50:09.301
You can't save everyone.
Let's go, Laszlo.

50:10.677 --> 50:12.221
Excuse me, Commander.

50:12.513 --> 50:13.889
You were told to leave.

50:13.972 --> 50:15.599
- You have your men. Now, go.
- Yes, but this boy.

50:15.682 --> 50:17.809
What about the boy? He's state
property. What's that to you?

50:17.893 --> 50:19.770
General Ziege and Colonel Woerns
do outrank you.

50:20.062 --> 50:22.940
Am I right? So in a way,
if I'm here with their authority

50:23.190 --> 50:24.233
I outrank you.

50:25.943 --> 50:27.945
You think that's gonna keep
me from shooting you?

50:28.028 --> 50:30.030
Of course not. No, no.
But your logic does.

50:30.364 --> 50:32.074
If you were to shoot me you
would have to explain it

50:32.157 --> 50:33.408
to the general
and to the commander

50:33.617 --> 50:35.202
why their
personal birthday present

50:35.285 --> 50:36.745
to FÃ¼hrer is no longer possible.

50:36.912 --> 50:39.706
Think about it,
it's no good for anybody.

50:45.087 --> 50:46.046
Get out.

50:48.841 --> 50:49.800
Get out.

50:54.429 --> 50:55.514
Wow, Grandpa

50:55.764 --> 50:57.808
you must have been very good
if he picked you.

50:59.142 --> 51:00.143
I wasn't.

51:01.019 --> 51:03.397
And anyway, I was too young
for him to pick me

51:04.398 --> 51:06.191
even if I was as good
as you are now.

51:06.692 --> 51:08.610
So why did he pick you?

51:14.074 --> 51:15.075
Grandpa?

51:17.077 --> 51:20.205
I was a boy who never saw
himself becoming a man.

51:47.983 --> 51:50.485
So we have
a violin-playing goalie

51:50.569 --> 51:52.154
and a kid as our substitute.

51:52.446 --> 51:53.488
Good work, coach.

51:55.324 --> 51:57.367
There is more
to this game than pure skill.

51:57.951 --> 51:58.994
Kid is number fourteen.

51:59.620 --> 52:01.038
The colonel will never
let you keep him.

52:01.622 --> 52:02.539
We'll see.

52:31.568 --> 52:32.736
Tell them to come down.

52:32.986 --> 52:34.696
Prisoners, come here. Now!

53:02.558 --> 53:03.642
Congratulations.

53:05.477 --> 53:07.479
You seem to have assembled
a formidable team.

53:08.730 --> 53:12.985
But correct me if I'm wrong,
I count 13 men and one child.

53:13.569 --> 53:15.445
Are you trying to
adjust the rules

53:15.529 --> 53:17.406
by sneaking an extra person
onto the field

53:17.489 --> 53:18.949
due to his small stature?

53:19.283 --> 53:20.993
- No, I... Yes...
- Thirteen.

53:21.118 --> 53:22.786
You will keep
to what was agreed upon.

53:23.412 --> 53:24.454
Henkel, take the child.

53:24.705 --> 53:26.331
No, no. Wait. Wait.

53:27.291 --> 53:29.543
Wait! Who do you think
will clean up after us?

53:29.877 --> 53:31.336
Get the ball when it
goes out of bounds?

53:31.461 --> 53:32.629
Supply us with water?

53:32.796 --> 53:34.673
One thing about kids is that
they have lots of energy.

53:35.549 --> 53:36.758
You think of me as a fool?

53:37.426 --> 53:38.385
No.

53:40.596 --> 53:43.432
It is always something
with you Laszlo.

53:46.602 --> 53:47.561
But fine.

53:49.855 --> 53:52.399
You will have an extra pair
of feet to run for you.

53:52.482 --> 53:53.483
You want this?

53:54.318 --> 53:55.527
- Yes.
- That means you'll have

53:55.611 --> 53:56.820
more energy to spare.

53:59.281 --> 54:02.201
So... for the next two days

54:03.660 --> 54:07.122
You and your team will get
a vacation...

54:09.708 --> 54:10.834
from all food.

54:15.631 --> 54:18.258
You can, of course, change your
mind right now if you want.

54:22.137 --> 54:23.138
No.

54:25.933 --> 54:26.934
Good.

54:39.363 --> 54:41.448
He never
should have picked me.

54:41.823 --> 54:43.116
It didn't make any sense.

54:44.076 --> 54:47.412
I was just some boy
he once saw and remembered.

54:48.872 --> 54:52.209
A little boy had
no place among men

54:52.751 --> 54:56.630
whose children were lost,
or in other camps.

54:57.381 --> 54:58.340
Yet...

55:00.133 --> 55:01.802
he stood by my side.

55:07.057 --> 55:08.100
Can't sleep?

55:09.017 --> 55:10.060
No.

55:11.186 --> 55:12.771
Everyone is angry at me.

55:13.021 --> 55:15.899
Not having food for few days
will do that to people.

55:17.109 --> 55:18.735
But don't worry,
they'll get over it.

55:21.613 --> 55:22.698
You know, I...

55:23.240 --> 55:25.033
I did many mistakes in my life

55:25.576 --> 55:27.244
but this time,
I did the right thing.

55:29.663 --> 55:30.664
Go to sleep now.

55:31.206 --> 55:32.457
You'll need it for tomorrow.

55:33.500 --> 55:36.044
I will, Mr Laszlo. Thank you.

55:41.508 --> 55:44.344
In the days leading up
to our glorious match

55:45.012 --> 55:46.680
you may think you are special...

55:46.972 --> 55:48.724
but you are nothing of the sort.

55:50.058 --> 55:52.352
Any and all
preferential treatment

55:52.769 --> 55:54.146
you might get accustomed to...

55:56.231 --> 55:57.232
don't.

55:59.026 --> 56:00.944
You are all still prisoners

56:01.653 --> 56:03.030
and will be treated as such.

56:04.573 --> 56:06.825
Anyone not fulfilling
his work assignment

56:08.577 --> 56:10.579
will be punished
with swift action.

56:12.414 --> 56:14.708
Anyone attempting
to escape will be shot.

56:15.542 --> 56:17.336
And this includes also...

56:19.713 --> 56:20.964
the youngest team member.

56:22.925 --> 56:25.594
I hope
not one of you gets injured.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.765
I'd hate to see Laszlo
play a game

56:29.848 --> 56:33.143
with ten men
and this little boy.

56:34.019 --> 56:35.312
When the final whistle blows

56:36.313 --> 56:38.649
everyone will go back
to what he was doing before.

56:39.691 --> 56:44.071
Including watching over geese.

56:44.613 --> 56:45.697
Would I be correct?

56:54.790 --> 56:57.918
The Commandant is
anxiously awaiting your return

56:58.794 --> 57:02.130
and so are all the geese
you let loose.

57:03.006 --> 57:04.466
One little boy

57:04.716 --> 57:08.053
will have to catch
every single one of them.

57:28.282 --> 57:29.658
Don't let him get to you, kid.

57:31.076 --> 57:32.077
I won't.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.495
But it's OK to feel scared.

57:34.288 --> 57:36.331
But you have 13 backs
to watch over you.

57:37.416 --> 57:38.458
Am I right, Karolyi?

57:39.084 --> 57:40.210
Aye, captain, my captain.

57:48.719 --> 57:50.262
Are we angry about the food?

57:54.600 --> 57:56.435
Are we angry about Andreas?

57:57.060 --> 57:58.103
Yes.

57:58.312 --> 57:59.563
You should be angry.

57:59.646 --> 58:00.522
I'm furious.

58:01.773 --> 58:02.941
So we have to use it.

58:04.776 --> 58:07.571
Every time you see Nazi come
charging down the field

58:07.654 --> 58:09.781
remember how hungry

58:09.865 --> 58:12.534
remember how angry you were
in this moment.

58:14.661 --> 58:16.830
Anger wasted
on the wrong address

58:17.372 --> 58:18.874
is anger that lingers on.

58:19.541 --> 58:21.418
So send it the way of the Nazis

58:21.627 --> 58:24.379
and you won't waste
a single breath.

58:26.381 --> 58:27.674
Are we angry?

58:27.925 --> 58:28.842
Yes!

58:31.553 --> 58:32.638
Are we angry?

58:32.888 --> 58:33.847
Yes!

58:53.825 --> 58:55.285
Good morning, gentlemen.

58:56.411 --> 58:57.871
General Ziege. Welcome.

58:58.163 --> 58:59.706
How is team Laszlo
looking today?

59:00.165 --> 59:02.209
I don't see them posing
a threat to our team.

59:02.543 --> 59:04.002
I predict a comfortable victory.

59:04.837 --> 59:07.297
- The FÃ¼hrer deserves it.
- Who is the man with the ball?

59:07.840 --> 59:09.424
That is Sandor Stekely

59:09.925 --> 59:11.343
a regional player from BakhÃ¡za.

59:12.594 --> 59:13.512
I would say

59:13.887 --> 59:15.889
behind Laszlo Horvath
and Karolyi Faraco

59:15.973 --> 59:17.891
he is likely
their third best player.

59:19.226 --> 59:21.812
Laszlo discovered him at
another camp. He's a real find.

59:22.479 --> 59:23.814
Sandor Stekely of BakhÃ¡za?

59:23.897 --> 59:26.441
Any relation to Magda Stekely,
the famous opera singer?

59:26.984 --> 59:28.443
Yes, I believe that is his wife.

59:31.947 --> 59:32.906
How interesting.

59:43.166 --> 59:44.168
How's your family?

59:44.710 --> 59:46.086
Do you know where they are?

59:47.296 --> 59:49.006
No, sir. I don't.

59:50.215 --> 59:52.134
My father helped a Jewish lady.

59:53.677 --> 59:55.053
Our families were friends.

59:56.930 --> 59:57.973
She helped in the kitchen

59:58.265 --> 01:00:01.810
and one of the waiters told
the Nazis to save himself...

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:04.771
and that's it.

01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:07.649
They separated us immediately...

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:10.152
burned down the restaurant...

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:12.529
and there was nothing left.

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:15.282
I was angry and furious

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.493
because I didn't think
I deserved to be saved.

01:00:19.494 --> 01:00:21.455
There's a guilt
you carry inside...

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:26.502
because you're
the only one who survives.

01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:30.005
Why me?

01:00:30.631 --> 01:00:31.715
Why not them?

01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:33.467
Why not all of us?

01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:37.095
So what about you, Laszlo?

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:39.348
Kids?

01:00:39.765 --> 01:00:40.641
Wife?

01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:43.393
I took my time
to pick the right girl.

01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:45.312
And?

01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:48.774
And... there were too
many to pick from

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.276
so I couldn't make up my mind.

01:00:51.902 --> 01:00:53.111
I don't know, I just...

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:57.074
I kept waiting
and waiting, and...

01:00:58.408 --> 01:00:59.618
then the war begins...

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:04.081
and suddenly no one cares
that much about falling in love.

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:09.670
I think you love football
so much that no one else

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.505
not even a woman,
stood a chance.

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:13.632
That could be true.

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:15.384
Football always was
my first love.

01:01:16.635 --> 01:01:18.345
and whenever
I did love someone else

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:20.264
football became kind of my...

01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:22.099
mistress.

01:01:23.392 --> 01:01:24.852
They would all wonder
where I was

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:28.063
what was I doing,
thinking I was unfaithful.

01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:31.066
But no, every chance
I had, I was...

01:01:32.734 --> 01:01:33.902
I was on that field.

01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:36.029
I was there.

01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:41.910
The scent of freshly
cut grass...

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.622
the moment when you slide
on your cleats...

01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:48.917
and the moment
when that football

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:50.460
gently touches your foot...

01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:54.131
it's a love affair
of epic proportions.

01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:56.175
You play...

01:01:58.135 --> 01:02:00.512
for, and out of, love...

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.182
and on a very good day

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.975
when game loves you back

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:07.561
and you taste the victory,
despite the odds...

01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:11.106
that's the day to live for.

01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:13.108
Yeah.

01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:15.777
Two more weeks.

01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:19.615
Then we find out
if David can topple Goliath.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:21.950
We're not David.

01:02:22.451 --> 01:02:24.328
We're an ant under David's foot.

01:02:25.204 --> 01:02:26.163
Good.

01:02:26.622 --> 01:02:28.081
If they think of us as an ant

01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:29.917
...we can win.

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:37.090
Sandor Stekely, correct?

01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:39.968
Correct, sir.

01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:43.263
The colonel would like
to see you in his office.

01:02:44.306 --> 01:02:45.349
Now.

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:46.743
What a voice your wife has.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:52.875
It seems my superior,
General Ziege

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.251
is a great admirer of her.

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:56.712
He is not a man
who is easily impressed.

01:03:57.087 --> 01:03:58.338
What does my wife have...

01:03:58.422 --> 01:04:00.007
At his invitation

01:04:00.132 --> 01:04:03.177
your wife will tonight be
giving a performance

01:04:03.427 --> 01:04:05.387
at the concert house
in Karlovac.

01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:08.932
And your wife has
asked the general

01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:11.226
if he could see to it
that this letter

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:14.688
be personally delivered
to you.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:51.642
I have, of course

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.562
prepared
your release authorisation.

01:05:39.523 --> 01:05:40.482
Thank you.

01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:58.750
Sandor!

01:06:00.169 --> 01:06:01.211
Sandor.

01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:03.755
Alright? Come on!

01:06:05.465 --> 01:06:07.134
Go, go. OK? Let's go!

01:06:07.843 --> 01:06:08.886
Sandor!

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.490
I think you should talk to him.

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:32.451
Sandor.

01:06:35.495 --> 01:06:36.496
Join us.

01:06:54.515 --> 01:06:55.516
You alright?

01:07:00.312 --> 01:07:01.271
Yes.

01:07:04.942 --> 01:07:05.859
My wife...

01:07:12.991 --> 01:07:14.326
I think she wants to help me.

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:16.828
Help you? How?

01:07:27.464 --> 01:07:29.258
I received a letter today.

01:07:32.845 --> 01:07:34.763
There is a way for us
to be together again.

01:07:34.847 --> 01:07:37.140
No, no,
don't fall for their trick.

01:07:37.307 --> 01:07:38.475
They're trying to sell
you a story.

01:07:38.684 --> 01:07:39.685
What if it's true?

01:07:40.310 --> 01:07:41.979
I know her handwriting.
It was her.

01:07:42.062 --> 01:07:43.772
Karolyi, give me your letter.

01:07:45.357 --> 01:07:46.400
Give me your letter.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.488
It's been glued back.

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.658
Never underestimate the Nazis.

01:07:54.867 --> 01:07:56.243
Yes, but this is different.

01:07:57.786 --> 01:07:58.954
We were offered a deal.

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:00.747
Don't you see
what they are doing?

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:04.001
Sandor, it's your wife.

01:08:07.838 --> 01:08:08.797
Fine.

01:08:09.381 --> 01:08:10.340
San...

01:08:17.389 --> 01:08:18.515
Do you think it's true?

01:08:20.392 --> 01:08:22.853
- About their offer?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

01:08:24.062 --> 01:08:26.564
The game hasn't even started
and they're already ahead.

01:08:41.705 --> 01:08:42.662
I changed my mind.

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.501
I can't go through
with the offer.

01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:48.127
Please, I must speak
with the colonel.

01:08:54.635 --> 01:08:56.511
I do not know what you
are talking about.

01:08:57.888 --> 01:09:00.265
Please, I'm begging you.

01:09:03.268 --> 01:09:05.020
I can't have
my wife go through that.

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:11.443
Back to work, prisoner Stekely.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:15.781
Please, Henkel.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.950
Please.

01:09:19.201 --> 01:09:20.243
Sandor, stop!

01:09:42.057 --> 01:09:44.142
Hey! Sandor!

01:10:15.382 --> 01:10:18.510
Tomasz,
I must see my wife tonight.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.599
Please, I know what I'm doing.

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:26.059
I will be back in the morning.

01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:34.711
Halt!

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:38.131
Halt!

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:19.214
<i>Brava!</i>

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.258
<i>Brava!</i>

01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:24.678
<i>Brava!</i>

01:12:36.148 --> 01:12:38.734
Was I not clear
that if someone tried to escape

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:40.611
they'd be met with
severe penalty?

01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:41.737
You and Ziege did this.

01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:43.780
No! You did this to yourself!

01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:46.116
You picked these men!
You wanted to see other camps!

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.492
Sandor was your choice!

01:12:47.701 --> 01:12:48.619
He was a weak man

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:50.078
who made a stupid
and fatal error!

01:12:50.162 --> 01:12:51.747
- I have to find somebody else...
- No!

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:54.750
- He was one of our best players!
- You have 11 men

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:56.793
and, of course, your violin
player and the little boy.

01:12:56.877 --> 01:12:58.587
And If someone gets injured,
you play with ten men!

01:12:58.670 --> 01:12:59.546
I do not care!

01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:01.632
You will inform your team

01:13:01.715 --> 01:13:03.383
that all of your privileges
have been taken back.

01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:04.718
You'll receive limited food

01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:06.637
and there will be no
more mail delivered

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.096
until the match is played.

01:13:08.347 --> 01:13:09.848
This is not what we agreed to.

01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:13.477
Your teammate broke
the promise you made to me.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:15.145
We are done here. Good day.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:16.563
Henkel.

01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:21.693
You can't be serious
about me playing?

01:13:22.486 --> 01:13:23.612
I wasn't before.

01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:26.532
But now I have no choice,
you gotta be ready.

01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:28.784
But can't you kick
a ball at all?

01:13:30.619 --> 01:13:31.620
Well, yes.

01:13:32.538 --> 01:13:35.415
If you have to play,
you'll play defence.

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.543
This is insane.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.378
We are days away

01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:41.463
and you have to teach him
how to kick a ball?

01:13:42.422 --> 01:13:43.799
We wouldn't be in this situation

01:13:43.882 --> 01:13:45.342
if you didn't pick
a violin player

01:13:45.425 --> 01:13:47.636
with two left feet
and a little boy.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.013
How could I deny this boy

01:13:50.264 --> 01:13:52.224
his chance of growing up
and getting old?

01:13:55.269 --> 01:13:56.395
So, um...

01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:57.771
what's the plan?

01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:02.150
We all bunker down in our goal
and we wait, for our chance.

01:14:04.278 --> 01:14:05.237
Sounds about right.

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:09.116
Anytime you have an opponent
who is clearly better than you

01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:12.703
you can't go at them,
guns blazing.

01:14:13.495 --> 01:14:15.414
So we let them shoot
their way out of ammo

01:14:16.373 --> 01:14:17.583
and then we wait

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.668
for a crack in their armour.

01:14:20.169 --> 01:14:22.462
The moment that whistle blows,
they're coming at us.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:25.507
Patience is not something
they're known for

01:14:26.258 --> 01:14:28.051
and they won't be practising
it against us

01:14:28.135 --> 01:14:31.180
because they expect us
to lose, and lose badly.

01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:34.099
The longer we manage
to hold them back

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.268
the more nervous they will get.

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:38.395
And when certainty is replaced
by panic...

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:40.856
...we strike.

01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:44.818
Yes!

01:14:47.112 --> 01:14:48.697
If all we do is defend

01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:49.948
how do we score?

01:14:51.325 --> 01:14:52.659
What have we been training for?

01:14:53.452 --> 01:14:54.536
To defend, apparently.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:56.705
Our chance will come
from a counterattack.

01:14:58.373 --> 01:15:00.375
When they lose a possession,
which they will

01:15:01.668 --> 01:15:03.879
I'll make sure
I get the ball to one of you.

01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:05.255
So that's the plan?

01:15:05.506 --> 01:15:07.382
We wait
for them to lose the possession?

01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:09.801
If they ever lose one.

01:15:14.556 --> 01:15:15.516
You alright?

01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:16.725
Yeah.

01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:20.729
Aron, when in doubt,
what do you do?

01:15:21.271 --> 01:15:23.023
I kick the ball
as hard as I can.

01:15:23.774 --> 01:15:24.733
Good man.

01:15:26.777 --> 01:15:28.820
There is so much
you are capable of doing.

01:15:30.364 --> 01:15:31.532
We have a baker

01:15:32.449 --> 01:15:35.327
we have a florist,
we have a bookstore owner

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:37.746
we have a man
who still hasn't spoken a word.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:41.208
We have fathers and sons

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:42.960
and we have pride and dignity

01:15:43.085 --> 01:15:45.671
and we have so much more.

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:52.803
If we are going to rain on
their FÃ¼hrer's birthday parade

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.138
it's not going to be
with what I can do.

01:15:57.808 --> 01:16:00.227
It's going to be
with what each of you can do.

01:16:04.523 --> 01:16:07.276
Somehow, we were
coming together as a team.

01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:11.321
They tried to break us,
but it didn't work.

01:16:13.115 --> 01:16:15.951
Whatever they did,
we ended up feeling close.

01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:19.913
And as for Laszlo,
as things got worse

01:16:20.372 --> 01:16:22.249
the more it fired up his anger.

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.669
And he pushed and pushed
everyone to the edge.

01:16:26.712 --> 01:16:30.424
We'd watch him run and run,
and if he was ever tired

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:32.634
he would barely show it.

01:16:35.846 --> 01:16:39.016
If he didn't stop,
no one dared to stop either.

01:16:41.935 --> 01:16:45.022
Each of us had a hunger
that was different

01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.899
than just a lack of food.

01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:22.601
At all times, what do we do?

01:17:22.893 --> 01:17:23.852
Stay together!

01:17:24.061 --> 01:17:25.604
I'll yell "Franz".

01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:29.066
The code is "Franz".

01:17:29.483 --> 01:17:31.443
When you hear that,
run up front.

01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:33.695
- Alright?
- Yeah.

01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:38.283
Tomorrow, well, I don't have
to tell you what is tomorrow.

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:39.910
So get some rest

01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:42.704
and don't think about the game
until the match begins.

01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:47.000
At all times, what do we do?

01:17:47.543 --> 01:17:48.752
Stay together!

01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:01.139
You think he knows
what he's doing?

01:18:01.223 --> 01:18:03.517
He should know. He's played
the game all his life.

01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:06.770
Do you think we have a chance?

01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:08.105
To do what, win?

01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:09.857
Of course.

01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:12.192
I just wanna survive
another day.

01:18:13.193 --> 01:18:15.696
Laszlo said not to think about
football any more.

01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:16.822
So don't.

01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:18.198
Goodnight.

01:18:19.867 --> 01:18:20.784
Goodnight.

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.057
Why did you save me?

01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:54.151
You ever like a girl so much...

01:18:56.862 --> 01:19:00.073
that you can feel
your heart beating right up here

01:19:01.325 --> 01:19:02.242
near your throat?

01:19:04.953 --> 01:19:05.954
No.

01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:11.043
You ever kiss a girl?

01:19:17.007 --> 01:19:17.925
No.

01:19:19.343 --> 01:19:20.385
There is your answer.

01:19:22.304 --> 01:19:24.890
Without love and a kiss,
life is nothing

01:19:24.973 --> 01:19:27.434
but a big old book
filled with pages

01:19:27.518 --> 01:19:29.102
that have nothing to say.

01:19:32.356 --> 01:19:33.732
There was this one girl.

01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:37.361
I always walked past her house
on my way home.

01:19:38.153 --> 01:19:39.196
Did you smile?

01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:41.573
Every time you saw her?

01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:45.494
Yes.

01:19:46.495 --> 01:19:47.454
Did she?

01:19:49.373 --> 01:19:50.374
Sometimes.

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:52.584
That's nice, isn't it?

01:19:53.252 --> 01:19:54.586
Yes, it is.

01:19:57.756 --> 01:19:59.800
You'll find out,
one day, what it's like...

01:20:01.593 --> 01:20:04.096
when that "nice"
turns into extraordinary.

01:20:05.305 --> 01:20:06.682
Good night, Mr Laszlo.

01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:11.436
Good night, Mr Branko.

01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:40.132
Andreas,
what are you doing here?

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:42.509
The hospital released
me yesterday

01:20:42.593 --> 01:20:44.761
and ordered me to report
back to camp.

01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:46.388
How do you feel?

01:20:46.555 --> 01:20:49.683
I am ready to help
our team win the match.

01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:51.518
Too bad you can't play.

01:20:52.311 --> 01:20:53.937
All the positions
have been filled.

01:20:54.813 --> 01:20:55.814
You gave me your word.

01:20:57.524 --> 01:21:00.110
Andreas is not included
in the final count.

01:21:00.777 --> 01:21:01.987
We have written agreement.

01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:09.745
Yes, he can board the truck.

01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:15.936
You never played this before.
It's beautiful.

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:18.814
- What is it?
- It's called "Kol Nidrei."

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.484
It's played in many synagogues
on Yom Kippur Eve

01:22:24.111 --> 01:22:26.196
the holiest of Jewish holidays.

01:22:27.239 --> 01:22:29.950
That's what you played
the day I met you.

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:32.327
Laszlo, you have a good memory.

01:22:32.995 --> 01:22:33.912
No...

01:22:35.414 --> 01:22:36.832
don't tell me
you were teaching

01:22:36.915 --> 01:22:39.209
a Nazi officer
how to play a Jewish melody?

01:22:41.587 --> 01:22:42.754
It was worth the risk.

01:22:44.339 --> 01:22:45.966
Come on, keep on playing.

01:22:47.301 --> 01:22:48.302
We all need it.

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:04.920
It was the first time in ages

01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:07.840
we had all seen something
clean and fresh.

01:24:09.675 --> 01:24:10.634
Soap!

01:24:11.093 --> 01:24:12.845
Something that smelled new.

01:24:12.928 --> 01:24:13.929
Soaps!

01:24:15.305 --> 01:24:16.265
Real soap!

01:24:17.558 --> 01:24:19.351
I think that was the only time

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:21.228
I saw them behaving my age.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.526
Branko.

01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:29.319
Branko.

01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:34.408
So clean, so nice.

01:24:34.491 --> 01:24:36.994
Ooh!

01:24:37.327 --> 01:24:38.287
Nine.

01:25:01.059 --> 01:25:02.394
Wow!

01:25:05.147 --> 01:25:07.357
Little things become big quick

01:25:07.482 --> 01:25:10.903
if what you take for granted
is taken away from you.

01:25:18.035 --> 01:25:19.203
Aron...

01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:22.748
is going to play the part
of our coach.

01:25:23.248 --> 01:25:24.917
You just stand on the...

01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:28.879
I hope I'm not intruding,
gentlemen.

01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:30.881
You like the uniforms?

01:25:32.216 --> 01:25:33.759
Please, please, have a seat.

01:25:38.138 --> 01:25:40.766
I believe you are also enjoying
the towels and the soap.

01:25:41.767 --> 01:25:44.269
One must always have
fresh towels on a big match day.

01:25:44.436 --> 01:25:45.354
<i>Nee?</i>

01:25:52.819 --> 01:25:54.863
Now, if you'd excuse me,
Colonel

01:25:55.656 --> 01:25:57.366
I'm about to enlighten these men

01:25:57.699 --> 01:25:59.076
with my super-secret strategy

01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:00.577
that I wouldn't like you to hear

01:26:00.661 --> 01:26:02.287
unless you are here
to spy on me?

01:26:02.913 --> 01:26:03.956
No need for that.

01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:06.542
We want a just and fair battle
on the field.

01:26:07.334 --> 01:26:10.212
And the men in this room
represent fairness and justice.

01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:12.798
Certainly. I will leave
you with your team.

01:26:14.049 --> 01:26:15.717
Oh, one more thing.

01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:17.553
You will not need to wear
your armbands today.

01:26:18.428 --> 01:26:19.763
No need to mix politics

01:26:19.888 --> 01:26:21.431
and sport
on such a great occasion.

01:26:21.849 --> 01:26:23.600
What a fine idea, Colonel.

01:26:23.851 --> 01:26:27.271
This match does indeed have
nothing to do with politics.

01:26:28.397 --> 01:26:30.274
We are all here
to have a great time.

01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:33.652
Yes. Best of luck.

01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:42.953
Come closer.

01:26:46.164 --> 01:26:47.165
My team.

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:05.184
Let's just play together
and show these Nazis

01:27:05.309 --> 01:27:08.770
that football is not a game
in which they always win.

01:27:08.979 --> 01:27:10.522
Because what I see
in front of me

01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:12.441
it's not just a group of men.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.443
I see a team.

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:16.862
A team
that can beat anyone!

01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:19.281
Let's go now!

01:27:19.573 --> 01:27:22.659
Let's show them
what it feels like to bleed.

01:27:22.826 --> 01:27:23.785
Yeah.

01:27:24.661 --> 01:27:25.704
To victory!

01:27:26.371 --> 01:27:28.040
Today and always!

01:27:28.749 --> 01:27:32.377
To victory!

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.223
For years, I couldn't
go to see a game.

01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:49.144
The sounds I heard
that day wouldn't stop.

01:27:57.236 --> 01:27:58.904
The hate they had for us...

01:27:59.112 --> 01:28:00.155
it was constant.

01:28:00.572 --> 01:28:02.491
Like a scream
that kept coming...

01:28:03.158 --> 01:28:04.785
coming and coming.

01:28:07.496 --> 01:28:09.164
It still echoes.

01:28:15.921 --> 01:28:18.632
Grandpa,
was anyone rooting for you?

01:28:19.299 --> 01:28:22.469
To make the show complete,
a few were allowed in.

01:28:23.554 --> 01:28:27.099
We could see them,
but we could not hear them well.

01:28:30.519 --> 01:28:34.565
It was the only moment
our people could rise up

01:28:34.773 --> 01:28:36.692
even the slightest,
against the enemy.

01:28:55.127 --> 01:28:56.879
General Ziege, welcome.

01:28:57.337 --> 01:28:59.548
You've put together
quite the event, Woerns.

01:28:59.673 --> 01:29:00.883
- Thank you, sir.
- Impressive.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.260
Very impressive,
very impressive.

01:29:03.343 --> 01:29:04.678
Very good. Thank you.

01:29:25.407 --> 01:29:26.617
Were you scared?

01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:28.660
No.

01:29:29.036 --> 01:29:29.995
Not on that day.

01:29:30.579 --> 01:29:33.957
I had been scared and close
to death many times before.

01:29:35.501 --> 01:29:40.172
But on that spring afternoon,
being scared was not an option.

01:29:41.215 --> 01:29:43.509
We wanted victory. For us.

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:48.180
And for those
who were not afraid to rise up.

01:29:50.891 --> 01:29:52.643
We wanted to show our people

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.979
that even if this was
a football match

01:29:56.939 --> 01:29:58.357
it meant something else.

01:29:59.983 --> 01:30:01.151
Enough was enough.

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:05.155
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:06.448
<i>Heil!</i>

01:30:07.074 --> 01:30:08.909
<i>Heil!</i>

01:30:09.117 --> 01:30:10.619
<i>Heil!</i>

01:30:10.953 --> 01:30:12.079
<i>Heil!</i>

01:30:37.563 --> 01:30:39.064
The Hungarian team.

01:30:40.858 --> 01:30:42.025
They don't look like much.

01:30:45.195 --> 01:30:46.780
They have been practising, sir.

01:30:47.489 --> 01:30:49.950
We've given them many privileges
to prepare for today.

01:30:52.452 --> 01:30:54.204
I know The Reich will prevail.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.124
But we must give
a good performance.

01:30:58.208 --> 01:30:59.418
A believable one.

01:30:59.501 --> 01:31:01.170
- If you know what I mean.
- Of course.

01:31:02.713 --> 01:31:05.215
I want those in attendance
who are not rooting for us

01:31:05.299 --> 01:31:07.676
to feel good about the ability
of their men...

01:31:08.886 --> 01:31:10.554
despite the final defeat.

01:31:11.388 --> 01:31:12.514
Of course. So do I, sir.

01:31:13.515 --> 01:31:14.808
But don't let
their looks fool you.

01:31:14.892 --> 01:31:16.185
They are a feisty bunch.

01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:20.147
Like a pesky animal

01:31:20.981 --> 01:31:22.858
always looking for a way out.

01:31:24.026 --> 01:31:25.194
They will put up a fight.

01:31:30.449 --> 01:31:31.533
Good.

01:32:02.731 --> 01:32:04.024
They came at us

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:05.359
wanting blood.

01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:44.523
- Ah! It's OK.
- You alright?

01:32:44.648 --> 01:32:46.066
And Laszlo was right.

01:32:46.692 --> 01:32:48.652
They kept coming relentlessly.

01:32:49.069 --> 01:32:50.445
Left and right.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.914
Ooh!

01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:05.419
The Nazi team
must have had the ball

01:33:05.502 --> 01:33:07.504
in its possession
the entire half.

01:33:09.006 --> 01:33:10.424
We were dodging bullets

01:33:10.799 --> 01:33:12.509
and somehow, it was working.

01:33:16.555 --> 01:33:18.557
And as Laszlo had predicted

01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:21.435
they tried skipping
their ground game

01:33:21.518 --> 01:33:23.187
and switching
to an aerial game.

01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:25.898
Ooh!

01:33:30.319 --> 01:33:32.571
And when they tried
going through the air

01:33:33.864 --> 01:33:35.449
we knew we had them in a panic.

01:33:40.537 --> 01:33:42.748
I have never seen
a team try so hard

01:33:43.207 --> 01:33:44.416
and achieve so little.

01:33:46.335 --> 01:33:47.503
The more they shot...

01:33:48.253 --> 01:33:49.463
the more they missed.

01:33:52.466 --> 01:33:53.509
The more they missed...

01:33:53.967 --> 01:33:56.678
the more that seed of doubt
we hoped to plant

01:33:56.887 --> 01:33:59.389
began to grow and spread.

01:34:06.271 --> 01:34:08.232
All we did was defend

01:34:08.607 --> 01:34:10.234
defend, defend.

01:34:10.484 --> 01:34:12.694
But Laszlo said to wait.

01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:15.364
So we waited and waited

01:34:15.697 --> 01:34:16.823
for the tiny crack.

01:34:21.787 --> 01:34:23.330
And just before the half...

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:27.000
Franz!

01:34:51.233 --> 01:34:53.986
Bam! A bolt of lightning.

01:35:01.827 --> 01:35:04.496
And boy, were they stunned.

01:35:18.302 --> 01:35:20.345
That walk to the locker room

01:35:20.512 --> 01:35:22.723
will stay with me
till the day I die.

01:35:24.558 --> 01:35:26.935
When I remember our team,
for a moment there

01:35:27.311 --> 01:35:28.604
they were just like me.

01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:31.857
Like a little kid
with the type of smile you get

01:35:32.107 --> 01:35:34.067
when you're fearlessly happy.

01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:40.199
Is this part
of the celebration, Herr Woerns?

01:35:44.244 --> 01:35:46.163
I wonder if you have been
feeding these prisoners

01:35:46.455 --> 01:35:48.457
better than we have
our own players.

01:35:51.418 --> 01:35:54.630
Perhaps I should consider you
to be hired

01:35:54.713 --> 01:35:56.465
the next time our team trains

01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:59.176
for a much more serious
competition.

01:36:02.596 --> 01:36:04.890
Another month and you could have
made these prisoners

01:36:04.973 --> 01:36:06.558
into world champions.

01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:09.603
I assure you,
this is just luck. That is all.

01:36:10.938 --> 01:36:13.023
Nothing short
of a glorious victory

01:36:13.106 --> 01:36:14.650
on the FÃ¼hrer's birthday
is what we will see.

01:36:14.983 --> 01:36:16.068
I do hope so.

01:36:17.694 --> 01:36:20.781
We did not come
to see '36 repeat itself.

01:36:21.281 --> 01:36:24.117
Absolutely not.
If you will excuse me.

01:36:36.129 --> 01:36:37.005
What happens now?

01:36:37.172 --> 01:36:38.215
Karolyi, how's your ankle?

01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:40.050
I feel fine. I'll pull through.

01:36:40.133 --> 01:36:41.969
Good. What did I tell you?

01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:43.762
Goals are what counts!

01:36:43.971 --> 01:36:46.056
And when I look
at the scoreboard. We're ahead.

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:48.517
I love it!

01:36:49.935 --> 01:36:53.564
Do you think they'll offer us
something in return for losing?

01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:55.816
Wait a second. What losing?

01:36:56.066 --> 01:36:59.152
But don't you think we have
something to bargain with now?

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.072
Nazis, they don't bargain.

01:37:02.322 --> 01:37:03.240
They take.

01:37:09.204 --> 01:37:10.289
So...

01:37:10.664 --> 01:37:15.836
I must congratulate you
on an extraordinary

01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:18.505
but also
a very lucky performance.

01:37:19.464 --> 01:37:21.466
It's not luck. It's skill.

01:37:23.093 --> 01:37:24.303
I hope you men don't mind

01:37:25.012 --> 01:37:27.681
but I need to borrow
your captain for a brief moment.

01:37:27.848 --> 01:37:29.099
There's two of us.

01:37:29.850 --> 01:37:31.101
I will speak only
to you, Laszlo.

01:37:31.185 --> 01:37:32.436
I'm sorry, Colonel

01:37:32.728 --> 01:37:33.645
wherever Laszlo goes...

01:37:33.896 --> 01:37:35.355
Don't you let
that football uniform

01:37:35.439 --> 01:37:36.899
give you any sense
of entitlement!

01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:38.901
Is that understood?
This is an order!

01:37:39.526 --> 01:37:40.485
Yes.

01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:44.990
Laszlo. Outside, now.

01:37:56.335 --> 01:37:57.794
Laszlo the Great...

01:37:58.253 --> 01:37:59.421
trying to embarrass me.

01:38:00.172 --> 01:38:02.466
Congratulations,
you're doing a mighty fine job.

01:38:02.591 --> 01:38:03.550
You wanted a match.

01:38:03.884 --> 01:38:06.261
You wanted drama
and competition, so...

01:38:06.595 --> 01:38:08.222
What do you want? Tell me.

01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:10.682
You couldn't have
come here without a plan?

01:38:10.766 --> 01:38:11.725
That's enough!

01:38:13.644 --> 01:38:14.853
No more games.

01:38:17.356 --> 01:38:22.444
I want each member of my team
to be granted his freedom.

01:38:24.363 --> 01:38:25.364
Freedom.

01:38:26.573 --> 01:38:27.616
You remember that word?

01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:31.119
None of the men in that room
have tasted it for a long while.

01:38:31.203 --> 01:38:32.829
You can't have it.

01:38:35.832 --> 01:38:36.708
Alright.

01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:39.628
Me for their freedom.

01:38:40.045 --> 01:38:40.963
That's what I want.

01:38:44.508 --> 01:38:48.220
I could do away with you
any time I see fit.

01:38:48.512 --> 01:38:51.139
You could,
before this match started.

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.393
But now, from what I can see

01:38:54.935 --> 01:38:56.311
you're in a bit of a bind.

01:38:56.854 --> 01:38:58.272
Just as your Nazi team is.

01:38:58.355 --> 01:39:02.276
This is all just
a spectacle for you.

01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:04.736
Freedom for them.

01:39:05.904 --> 01:39:07.281
You've got Europe at your feet.

01:39:07.364 --> 01:39:09.074
What's freedom
to a few men to you?

01:39:14.496 --> 01:39:16.415
I cannot give you this.

01:39:21.587 --> 01:39:23.088
Don't you turn your back on me!

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.142
What're you gonna do?
Risk losing?

01:39:35.517 --> 01:39:39.104
I could promise you nothing
and we could still prevail.

01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:41.356
You could prevail.

01:39:42.441 --> 01:39:43.609
But is it worth the risk?

01:39:44.193 --> 01:39:46.862
Your men's feet must be aching
from all the missed shots.

01:39:46.945 --> 01:39:49.448
And don't forget,
I'll be there waiting.

01:39:50.199 --> 01:39:52.701
Waiting for another mistake
by your pretty team

01:39:52.784 --> 01:39:55.412
just as I was waiting
a few minutes ago.

01:39:59.833 --> 01:40:00.792
Alright.

01:40:04.087 --> 01:40:06.381
Your team can only gain
their freedom if they lose.

01:40:19.019 --> 01:40:21.396
I will tell my team
that losing the match

01:40:22.064 --> 01:40:23.315
will get them their freedom.

01:40:44.002 --> 01:40:45.254
If we lose to them

01:40:46.922 --> 01:40:47.798
you get to walk.

01:40:49.049 --> 01:40:50.300
Yes. You get your freedom.

01:40:51.134 --> 01:40:52.052
All of us?

01:40:52.636 --> 01:40:54.012
No. I stay behind.

01:40:54.721 --> 01:40:56.807
No, no, no.
That can't happen. We're a team.

01:40:56.974 --> 01:40:59.643
Must we be reminded
that the one thing

01:40:59.726 --> 01:41:02.980
that Nazis have
never given us, besides freedom

01:41:03.313 --> 01:41:05.774
is their word that
nothing "bad" will happen to us.

01:41:06.066 --> 01:41:08.068
All our families are
an example of that.

01:41:09.236 --> 01:41:11.196
What's the guarantee
that they keep their word?

01:41:11.446 --> 01:41:12.406
There isn't one.

01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.533
It's up to each of you
to decide.

01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:16.702
Lose a game...

01:41:18.287 --> 01:41:19.204
win freedom.

01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:22.499
Sounds about right.
I'd say it's a fair deal.

01:41:26.044 --> 01:41:27.462
I can't tell you what to do.

01:41:29.298 --> 01:41:31.216
This isn't just about football.

01:41:33.385 --> 01:41:34.344
It's life.

01:41:37.472 --> 01:41:38.682
Let's go now!

01:41:57.701 --> 01:41:58.827
Whatever happens

01:41:58.911 --> 01:42:01.496
if we're winning when
that clock up there shows "60"

01:42:01.747 --> 01:42:03.332
I don't wanna see you
on the side-lines.

01:42:03.582 --> 01:42:04.625
Why, sir Laszlo? I...

01:42:04.875 --> 01:42:07.002
No matter what.
You have to promise me!

01:42:07.461 --> 01:42:08.670
Find a place and hide there.

01:42:08.795 --> 01:42:10.339
Stay there,
until everyone leaves

01:42:10.631 --> 01:42:12.674
Because they're gonna
come and look for you.

01:42:14.343 --> 01:42:15.802
I promise. Yes.

01:42:16.762 --> 01:42:18.305
Laszlo, come on, let's go.

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:19.306
Good.

01:42:31.944 --> 01:42:34.029
I didn't know
why he wanted me to hide.

01:42:35.072 --> 01:42:36.615
I was confused and angry

01:42:37.491 --> 01:42:39.034
because if we won

01:42:39.785 --> 01:42:41.912
I wanted to be
with them to celebrate.

01:42:44.206 --> 01:42:46.500
They were my team. My family.

01:44:12.294 --> 01:44:13.295
Ooh!

01:44:13.378 --> 01:44:15.714
Laszlo was the rarest of men.

01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:17.925
You could steal the game
from him.

01:44:18.675 --> 01:44:21.386
You could make him bleed
and try to break him down.

01:44:22.012 --> 01:44:23.555
You could take away his freedom.

01:44:24.264 --> 01:44:26.600
But his will to win? Never.

01:44:30.395 --> 01:44:32.689
What other men saw
in his eyes on that day

01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:36.944
made them do something
no one thought was possible.

01:45:06.473 --> 01:45:09.601
That little ant
underneath David's foot

01:45:10.686 --> 01:45:12.145
had let out a roar

01:45:12.729 --> 01:45:15.482
that could make
even a lion run with fear.

01:45:28.829 --> 01:45:30.747
I will be back, I promise.

01:46:42.736 --> 01:46:44.488
Needing a penalty?

01:46:45.155 --> 01:46:48.242
It's not the Reich's recipe
for victory, Herr Woerns.

01:47:25.696 --> 01:47:26.613
<i>Ja!</i>

01:47:44.965 --> 01:47:46.341
My natural curiosity

01:47:46.425 --> 01:47:48.051
got the better of me
on that day.

01:47:49.052 --> 01:47:50.721
I know I had promised Laszlo

01:47:51.555 --> 01:47:52.514
and I did...

01:47:54.308 --> 01:47:56.143
but I had to see my team again.

01:47:56.977 --> 01:47:58.061
I had to.

01:47:58.896 --> 01:48:00.022
Whatever the cost.

01:48:26.048 --> 01:48:27.007
Istvan is done.

01:48:27.132 --> 01:48:28.717
But we only have
a few more minutes.

01:48:28.884 --> 01:48:29.760
He can't play.

01:48:30.135 --> 01:48:33.430
Tomasz, Tomasz!
Have you ever been on goal?

01:48:34.389 --> 01:48:35.432
Good, now is your chance.

01:48:35.933 --> 01:48:37.184
Who will play defense now?

01:48:37.935 --> 01:48:39.311
Aron. Aron!

01:48:40.312 --> 01:48:41.772
- Remember what we practiced?
- Yes.

01:48:41.855 --> 01:48:43.815
When in doubt, just kick
the ball as hard as possible.

01:48:43.899 --> 01:48:45.108
- But far away from our side.
- Yes.

01:48:45.317 --> 01:48:46.235
Come on.

01:51:06.917 --> 01:51:09.586
That was the last time
I ever saw them.

01:51:11.797 --> 01:51:13.507
Laszlo didn't save me once.

01:51:14.675 --> 01:51:15.843
He saved me twice.

01:52:18.906 --> 01:52:19.990
What happened, Grandpa?

01:52:21.491 --> 01:52:22.618
What happened to them?

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.550
Thirteen men died that day

01:53:19.883 --> 01:53:21.134
because they fought back.

01:53:21.635 --> 01:53:23.512
They died
because they said "enough"

01:53:23.637 --> 01:53:26.098
to an evil that the world had
never seen before.

01:53:27.724 --> 01:53:31.228
The beauty of football
was kind to them that day.

01:53:33.313 --> 01:53:35.691
The ugliness
of the world surrounding them...

01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:37.442
was not.

01:53:38.694 --> 01:53:40.863
Not a day goes by
without me thinking

01:53:40.946 --> 01:53:43.031
of the happiness
I saw on their faces.

01:53:48.704 --> 01:53:49.705
Football...

01:53:50.789 --> 01:53:52.583
resembles life sometimes.

01:53:54.209 --> 01:53:56.336
The struggle, the discipline...

01:53:57.462 --> 01:53:59.047
the sacrifice it demands.

01:54:03.844 --> 01:54:05.429
Remember that, David.

01:54:06.597 --> 01:54:07.723
Every time you play.

01:54:09.016 --> 01:54:12.102
And sometimes it saves a life.

01:54:13.687 --> 01:54:14.730
As it did mine.

01:54:16.982 --> 01:54:20.903
So every time
you go out there and play

01:54:22.029 --> 01:54:23.363
always give your best.

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:26.033
You owe it to the game

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:28.327
and to what it represents.

01:54:31.163 --> 01:54:33.749
Laszlo was our best player

01:54:35.125 --> 01:54:37.711
but if he tried
to do everything himself?

01:54:38.045 --> 01:54:39.087
You wouldn't have won.

01:54:40.214 --> 01:54:42.132
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:46.303
Come here.

01:54:58.190 --> 01:54:59.233
It's getting late.

01:54:59.858 --> 01:55:00.984
We better go.

01:55:01.443 --> 01:55:03.028
I don't want your mother
to worry.
