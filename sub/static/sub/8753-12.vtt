WEBVTT

00:10.281 --> 00:14.220
It hurts to be in here.

00:15.628 --> 00:18.291
I don't know how to protect my family.

00:18.293 --> 00:21.286
If you go in that barn,
you're gonna die.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.929
I hate this house.

00:22.931 --> 00:25.442
I love my house, but I love my family more.

00:25.444 --> 00:27.862
Ow!!

00:27.864 --> 00:29.068
This is worse than a prison.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.288
That's very, very, very bad

00:31.290 --> 00:32.695
and there's blood.

00:32.698 --> 00:36.388
I think that the living
are caught in a war zone.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.410
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:39.412 --> 00:42.627
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.629 --> 00:44.735
What's happening?

00:44.737 --> 00:45.841
I see dead people.

00:45.843 --> 00:48.290
It seems like a devil.

00:48.292 --> 00:50.778
I speak to dead people.

00:50.780 --> 00:51.948
He's pissed off.

00:51.950 --> 00:53.117
And they speak to me.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.290
I felt real fear.

00:55.292 --> 00:58.279
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.281 --> 01:00.295
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.297 --> 01:01.906
I rely on my partner.

01:01.908 --> 01:03.177
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.179 --> 01:05.185
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.187 --> 01:07.295
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.297 --> 01:10.497
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.499 --> 01:11.698
Nobody believes me.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.168
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.449
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.195
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.197 --> 01:19.235
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.237 --> 01:20.439
...until the very end.

01:20.441 --> 01:22.215
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.217 --> 01:24.428
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.430 --> 01:26.508
This is <i> our</i> house,
whether they like it or not.

01:26.510 --> 01:28.279
Or time to get out.

01:28.281 --> 01:30.487
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:45.495 --> 01:47.464
I'm in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania.

01:47.466 --> 01:50.638
It's an upscale community about
40 minutes outside of Philly.

01:50.640 --> 01:53.316
Amy and I were called in
by a woman named Carol.

01:53.318 --> 01:57.189
Now she told me the activity
in her dream home is so bad

01:57.191 --> 01:59.660
it's ruining her health and
tearing her family apart.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.499
She got real emotional on the phone

02:01.501 --> 02:02.870
and begged us to come out.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.806
She says we're her last hope.

02:08.913 --> 02:10.282
Before Amy arrives,

02:10.283 --> 02:14.420
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

02:14.422 --> 02:17.359
This house has a lot of family photos.

02:17.361 --> 02:19.262
Once they're covered or removed,

02:19.264 --> 02:21.932
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.888
I think I'm feeling, like, sick.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.260
I have a fever.

02:38.262 --> 02:41.102
Hot and cold at the same time

02:41.104 --> 02:43.538
and heart's pounding.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.739
I'm also getting this woman.

02:45.741 --> 02:48.243
I think she causes...

02:48.245 --> 02:51.146
sickness and, um,

02:51.148 --> 02:52.647
extreme nausea.

02:52.649 --> 02:55.453
But she always is moving
all over the [bleep] place.

02:57.359 --> 02:59.160
She literally looks like a [bleep] blur.

02:59.162 --> 03:01.031
And she likes to move things around.

03:01.033 --> 03:04.304
Redecorating is what she thinks she's doing.

03:04.306 --> 03:06.708
And she's very strange-looking.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.849
She has spider arms and spider legs,

03:09.851 --> 03:12.589
and then her head is more... just,
like, a skull.

03:12.591 --> 03:14.725
She's scary and she scares people.

03:25.507 --> 03:26.640
Uh, so, Carol, I'm glad I'm here.

03:26.642 --> 03:28.611
You sounded really upset on the phone

03:28.613 --> 03:30.380
and it sounds like you're
going through a tough time.

03:30.382 --> 03:33.350
Yeah, I called you in
'cause I really need help.

03:33.352 --> 03:36.723
I'm concerned for our physical safety,

03:36.725 --> 03:38.294
emotional safety,

03:38.296 --> 03:41.064
and I don't know how to protect my family.

03:41.066 --> 03:42.666
Now how long have you lived here?

03:42.668 --> 03:44.335
12 years.

03:44.337 --> 03:45.938
Now who lives in the house with you now?

03:45.940 --> 03:47.742
My husband and my son.

03:47.744 --> 03:52.847
My daughter, who's in college,
used to, uh, be here.

03:52.849 --> 03:55.551
And the older daughter
lives about 20 minutes away

03:55.553 --> 03:56.887
with her daughter.

03:56.889 --> 03:58.923
Now tell me what's going on in the house.

03:58.925 --> 04:02.695
Noises, things being moved around,

04:02.697 --> 04:05.568
seeing shadows,

04:05.570 --> 04:10.471
and I definitely think
it impacts how you feel.

04:10.473 --> 04:13.307
Within the first year of living here,

04:13.309 --> 04:15.541
I ended up getting sick...

04:15.543 --> 04:17.176
uh, fibromyalgia,

04:17.178 --> 04:19.947
chronic fatigue, migraines.

04:19.949 --> 04:22.283
You seem to think it has
to do with the house.

04:22.285 --> 04:23.917
I think it can all be tied in.

04:23.919 --> 04:26.721
Doctors, when they would test,
would say I look great on paper.

04:26.723 --> 04:28.989
Okay, 'cause to look at you,
you look healthy.

04:28.991 --> 04:31.190
Why don't you just move?

04:31.192 --> 04:34.026
It's our home, and I don't wanna leave.

04:34.028 --> 04:38.629
But I'm very fearful for my family,
for my kids,

04:38.631 --> 04:41.064
and my grandchild.

04:44.568 --> 04:48.100
The living, yeah, they totally see her,

04:48.102 --> 04:50.099
the woman from outside.

04:50.101 --> 04:51.401
I think they see her, like...

04:51.403 --> 04:53.237
- like if the light was shining on her...
- Right.

04:53.239 --> 04:54.806
and then there's a shadow.

04:56.073 --> 04:57.971
Oh, she's goes [bleep] nuts in here, man.

04:59.372 --> 05:02.574
She really makes you not feel good,

05:02.576 --> 05:05.576
and the thing heart and the...fever.

05:05.578 --> 05:08.981
You know, she just does... it's terrible.

05:08.983 --> 05:10.350
She has too much energy.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.952
What does that do to the living?

05:11.954 --> 05:14.283
Probably give you a heart attack. Mm-hmm.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.951
Okay, Carol,
so why are we up in this part of the house?

05:21.953 --> 05:24.886
Upstairs here is when I
first came face-to-face

05:24.888 --> 05:26.887
with a black mass.

05:26.889 --> 05:29.655
Came up to about my waist level.

05:29.657 --> 05:31.992
I came up on it from behind,

05:31.994 --> 05:35.529
and the top of it turned
around and looked at me.

05:35.531 --> 05:37.998
Okay, have... have you seen it again?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.701
I've seen a shadow figure.

05:39.703 --> 05:43.205
I think it's the same thing.
It's just in a different form.

05:43.207 --> 05:47.811
More like a male adult, around 6-feet-9.

05:47.813 --> 05:49.413
Now is anything else going on?

05:49.415 --> 05:50.746
One of the things is that

05:50.748 --> 05:52.747
the door will just close on its own.

05:52.749 --> 05:55.815
You're talking about these doors right here?

05:55.817 --> 05:57.050
Just...

05:57.052 --> 05:58.852
- outta nowhere?
- Yes.

05:58.854 --> 06:00.388
Do you hear it?

06:00.390 --> 06:04.228
No. You don't hear it closing,
you don't hear it latching shut,

06:04.230 --> 06:05.561
but it's closed.

06:05.563 --> 06:07.830
Okay. Now what about it being on a tilt?

06:07.832 --> 06:09.732
This is not off-kilter or anything?

06:09.734 --> 06:12.706
No. It has a latch handle,
so you think you would hear it.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.379
Like that. You'd hear that.
You would hear that.

06:18.381 --> 06:19.713
I can't explain it.

06:19.715 --> 06:20.914
Well, that's gotta scare the hell outta ya,

06:20.916 --> 06:22.382
you turn around and see the door closed.

06:22.384 --> 06:24.250
Yeah, I don't sleep very well.

06:28.723 --> 06:32.195
There's somebody else in the house, uh,

06:32.197 --> 06:35.533
that the woman from outside doesn't like.

06:35.535 --> 06:38.399
Uh, and I think he kinda
torments her a little bit.

06:38.401 --> 06:40.401
He is...

06:40.403 --> 06:42.739
always looking for her

06:42.741 --> 06:45.542
and won't let her alone.

06:46.878 --> 06:50.921
She says that dude is up the stairs.

06:50.923 --> 06:53.355
He's like a bull in a china shop.

06:54.188 --> 06:58.795
He's not aware of, you know, his strength.

06:58.797 --> 07:03.200
He's like, you think about a door,
and a door slams...

07:03.202 --> 07:04.703
and then all the [bleep] doors slam.

07:04.705 --> 07:07.003
But it's not like he meant to.

07:07.005 --> 07:09.504
Do you know how he might
appear to the living?

07:09.506 --> 07:13.808
I think they see him a
like a big black mist.

07:13.810 --> 07:17.079
They might see him, like,
hovering over them,

07:17.081 --> 07:19.315
like, lurking in the corner.

07:19.317 --> 07:21.349
He's like,
"I'm trying to take care of that [bleep].

07:21.351 --> 07:23.486
I'm trying to [bleep] control her ass."

07:23.488 --> 07:25.891
Uh, he says that she
causes all the problems.

07:25.893 --> 07:28.125
All the problems. Not him. It's her.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.466
Sure as [bleep] wants to break things.

07:36.468 --> 07:38.301
She doesn't wanna [bleep] be here anymore.

07:38.303 --> 07:40.971
She's tired of the [bleep]
crazy-ass guy who's here,

07:40.973 --> 07:42.439
[bleep] tortures her.

07:42.441 --> 07:44.172
Uh, so she gets out occasionally.

07:44.174 --> 07:46.542
Uh, but then, you know,
she ends up back here,

07:46.544 --> 07:50.013
and then there he is, and she's upset.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.687
Okay.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.289
You had an experience here?

08:02.291 --> 08:05.826
Yeah.
At one point, I did have horses. Okay.

08:05.828 --> 08:09.432
So to help with, uh,
mice that come in with the food grain,

08:09.434 --> 08:11.466
I had purchased some cats.

08:11.468 --> 08:12.800
And to keep the wildlife out,

08:12.802 --> 08:14.803
we would put cat food in a container.

08:14.805 --> 08:16.305
And to make sure they
couldn't get into that,

08:16.307 --> 08:19.007
we put a cinder block on top.
Okay, what happened?

08:19.009 --> 08:21.276
One time, my son came out to feed the cats.

08:21.278 --> 08:23.578
One of our cats was dead within the bin.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.413
<i> Inside</i> the bin?

08:25.415 --> 08:27.484
And the cinder block was on top.

08:27.486 --> 08:28.885
Okay.
He must've been shocked when he saw that.

08:28.887 --> 08:30.387
Yeah. Me, too.

08:30.389 --> 08:32.020
It just floored me.

08:32.023 --> 08:34.489
Is there any chance the cat
jumped in before he closed it

08:34.491 --> 08:36.756
and didn't see the cat and
maybe suffocated this thing?

08:36.759 --> 08:38.491
It's not a real deep food bin.

08:38.494 --> 08:40.693
All right, so he would've seen the cat.
He would've seen it.

08:40.696 --> 08:42.027
Well, I got news for you.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.864
- If that's supernatural, you got a problem.
- Yeah.

08:44.866 --> 08:46.034
I know you got issues here,
but what are you...

08:46.036 --> 08:47.202
what are you trying to get out

08:47.204 --> 08:48.571
of the investigation we're gonna do?

08:48.573 --> 08:50.271
I need to find out what's going on here

08:50.273 --> 08:52.907
for the safety of my family.

08:52.909 --> 08:55.743
I think whatever this entity is,

08:55.745 --> 08:58.513
it can impact people's personalities,

08:58.515 --> 09:01.214
like the behavior of Kelly in the past.

09:01.216 --> 09:03.416
- Kelly's your daughter?
- Kelly's my daughter.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.453
What are we talking about?
What kind of behavior?

09:05.455 --> 09:09.556
When we moved in here,
she became just atrocious...

09:09.558 --> 09:11.592
the things that she would say

09:11.594 --> 09:14.896
and her physical violence against me.

09:14.898 --> 09:16.164
It was almost as if

09:16.166 --> 09:17.967
it wasn't even my daughter
saying the things she was

09:17.969 --> 09:20.137
and doing the things she was.

09:20.139 --> 09:21.305
But why do you think that's paranormal

09:21.307 --> 09:23.238
and not just teenage nonsense?

09:23.240 --> 09:25.675
Well, because when she then
moved out of the house...

09:25.677 --> 09:29.513
we actually asked her to
leave because her personality,

09:29.515 --> 09:32.983
the way she was acting
jeopardized my marriage,

09:32.985 --> 09:36.017
jeopardized the rest of
the children in the house.

09:36.019 --> 09:37.184
Okay.

09:37.186 --> 09:38.418
And when we asked her to leave,

09:38.420 --> 09:41.119
then she's done a complete turnaround.

09:41.121 --> 09:42.387
Really?

09:42.389 --> 09:44.388
No more explosive outbursts.

09:44.390 --> 09:46.255
It's completely different.

09:52.797 --> 09:55.265
I'm feeling that same woman.

09:55.267 --> 09:59.166
Something, uh, she, uh...

09:59.168 --> 10:00.499
She has been saying,

10:00.501 --> 10:03.366
"Oh,
don't go in there 'cause you'll all die!

10:03.368 --> 10:05.068
You'll all die!"

10:05.070 --> 10:08.006
She's saying there's
something in here that's, uh,

10:08.008 --> 10:09.172
not good.

10:09.174 --> 10:10.505
It's done harm.

10:11.841 --> 10:15.647
She thinks that no one
can take care of this.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.582
That's very, very, very bad.

10:18.584 --> 10:20.486
It's been here a long time.

10:20.488 --> 10:22.987
This thing is, uh...

10:22.989 --> 10:24.222
a blob.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.158
It came...

10:26.160 --> 10:28.393
like a snake

10:28.395 --> 10:30.325
that, uh...

10:30.327 --> 10:33.360
may be influencing people.

10:33.362 --> 10:35.431
Because it talks to them?

10:36.367 --> 10:39.370
It's made a lot of people...

10:39.372 --> 10:40.504
angry.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.807
It can make you do bad things.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.843
But it does... it causes damage.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.108
A lot of damage.

10:46.110 --> 10:48.005
I don't like it in here.

10:48.007 --> 10:50.775
It hurts to be in here.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.904
So, Rob, I was talking to your wife,

11:13.906 --> 11:16.442
and, uh, it was upsetting listening to her.

11:16.444 --> 11:18.444
So, uh, how you taking all this?

11:18.446 --> 11:19.843
It's been very stressful.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.413
I'm an engineer, so, you know,
I believe in science

11:22.415 --> 11:24.915
and I look for facts and I look for proof.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.719
Things just kept happening
and happening that

11:27.721 --> 11:29.489
I really couldn't explain.

11:29.491 --> 11:31.827
It's very disconcerting,
and especially because of

11:31.829 --> 11:34.793
all the different kinds of
things that have happened.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.094
Have you had any experiences
while you've been here?

11:37.096 --> 11:39.031
I've heard footsteps.

11:39.033 --> 11:42.067
Laying in bed,
I've heard things outside in the hallway.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.202
Now the footsteps... you sure it wasn't

11:43.204 --> 11:44.872
- one of the kids walking around?
- Yeah.

11:44.874 --> 11:46.041
Positive?

11:46.043 --> 11:47.611
Yeah. Sure. Positive. Absolutely.

11:47.613 --> 11:49.215
Okay, so now anything else happen to you?

11:49.217 --> 11:52.715
I had an episode where I
woke up in the morning,

11:52.717 --> 11:55.953
took a shower, and my back burned.

11:55.955 --> 11:59.526
And I felt to the back,
and I had scratches on my back.

11:59.528 --> 12:03.396
And my wife said,
"You have big gouges on your back."

12:03.398 --> 12:06.500
And she actually ended up
taking a picture of 'em.

12:06.502 --> 12:09.236
This is your back? That's my back.

12:09.238 --> 12:12.204
Show me where these scratches would've been

12:12.206 --> 12:14.072
and how you could've did it.

12:14.074 --> 12:16.975
It would've been...

12:16.977 --> 12:19.343
like...right here.

12:19.345 --> 12:21.379
I- I mean... And I would've had to,
essentially,

12:21.381 --> 12:23.847
- just do like that.
- Oh, I see where it was.

12:23.849 --> 12:26.350
It was, like,
right into the meaty part of my back.

12:26.352 --> 12:27.751
It is possible? Yeah.

12:27.753 --> 12:30.220
But it's kinda pushing it
that you did it yourself.

12:30.222 --> 12:32.855
I mean,
it's almost like you were in a straitjacket.

12:32.857 --> 12:34.724
What do <i> you</i> think is going on in this house?

12:34.726 --> 12:37.058
There's some sort of...

12:37.060 --> 12:39.729
uh... haunting.

12:39.731 --> 12:42.897
You know, I love my house,
but I love my family more.

12:42.899 --> 12:45.766
And I'll... if I... if I need to move,
I'll move.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.238
She's pissed. Oh, she's pissed.

12:55.210 --> 12:57.577
He keeps saying he doesn't
mean to hurt anybody.

12:57.579 --> 13:00.079
I think he, like, cuts people.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.148
That's what sh... wait.

13:04.150 --> 13:06.184
I think that's what <i>she's</i> saying.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.123
So who the [bleep] knows who's cuttin' who?

13:10.560 --> 13:11.726
I'm caught in the middle of a war

13:11.728 --> 13:13.759
between the dead man and woman.

13:13.761 --> 13:15.993
Both are telling me
completely different stories,

13:15.995 --> 13:19.260
and it's impossible to know
who's telling the truth.

13:19.262 --> 13:22.595
He's like,<i> "I'm</i> the one trying to protect."

13:22.597 --> 13:25.200
He tries to stop her from
doing her crazy [bleep].

13:25.202 --> 13:28.342
He's more... worried about her,

13:28.344 --> 13:33.917
because she physically effects the living.

13:37.754 --> 13:41.223
That's what he's trying to stop.

13:41.225 --> 13:45.093
He feels like the problems he causes

13:45.095 --> 13:48.731
are far less than if he was not here

13:48.733 --> 13:51.568
and she was running amok.

13:58.868 --> 14:00.567
So, Kelly,
I'm glad I got a chance to speak to you.

14:00.569 --> 14:02.068
I was talking to mom,

14:02.070 --> 14:03.670
and she told me you were having a...

14:03.672 --> 14:05.438
kind of a tough time in this house.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.376
I hate this house. Hate it.
It's just negative.

14:09.378 --> 14:11.606
But she thought that

14:11.608 --> 14:14.342
whatever's in this house
definitely influenced you.

14:14.344 --> 14:16.546
I think it had an influence.

14:16.548 --> 14:18.781
We were always just at each others' necks.

14:18.783 --> 14:21.685
Even the little mistakes would
turn into a total blowup.

14:21.687 --> 14:24.353
- You got violent.
- Yeah. It was bad.

14:24.355 --> 14:26.222
Sometimes you just get so mad and,
like, black out

14:26.224 --> 14:28.994
and not really be able
to put 2 and 2 together

14:28.996 --> 14:31.365
about what just happened.

14:31.367 --> 14:32.633
Let me just ask you.
Do you think it was the house

14:32.635 --> 14:34.735
and what's in this house that did it to you?

14:34.737 --> 14:35.971
Or do you think it was just

14:35.973 --> 14:37.273
you were being a pain in the ass teenager?

14:37.275 --> 14:40.441
Um, 100% believe with everything in me

14:40.443 --> 14:42.779
that there is something here.

14:45.383 --> 14:49.119
She's telling me everything that she does,
uh, to people.

14:49.121 --> 14:53.123
She kind of harassed
someone that lived here.

14:55.392 --> 14:58.028
There's a young girl... teenager, I think...

14:58.030 --> 15:00.866
that she didn't have respect for her mom.

15:00.868 --> 15:03.403
She had very bad thoughts

15:03.405 --> 15:05.973
that were not good, pure.

15:05.975 --> 15:07.507
She really, really hated her.

15:07.509 --> 15:09.675
And she...

15:09.677 --> 15:11.712
kind of really let her have it.

15:11.714 --> 15:13.148
What did she do?

15:13.150 --> 15:15.015
She kinda always jumped her <i>a lot.</i>

15:17.952 --> 15:21.588
And it would make the kid very sick.

15:21.590 --> 15:24.126
I think she kinda possessed her.

15:26.794 --> 15:28.294
Why'd you wanna meet me in this room?

15:28.296 --> 15:30.527
This actually used to be my first room here

15:30.529 --> 15:31.863
when we first moved in,

15:31.865 --> 15:35.004
and this is where I had my
first experience in the house.

15:35.006 --> 15:37.639
Okay, what was that?

15:37.641 --> 15:39.408
Uh, actually, this door right here.

15:39.410 --> 15:41.411
Um, very first night we had moved in,

15:41.413 --> 15:45.277
um, just, like, banging and knocking.

15:45.279 --> 15:47.278
Now are we talking about like...

15:47.280 --> 15:50.614
banging like a person was doing it?
As if there was

15:50.616 --> 15:54.284
literally somebody stuck on the other side

15:54.286 --> 15:55.851
trying to get through.

15:55.853 --> 15:57.184
So...

15:57.186 --> 15:59.352
Like that.

15:59.354 --> 16:00.521
Exactly like that.

16:00.523 --> 16:02.322
I'm 51 years old.

16:02.324 --> 16:04.158
That would scare the hell
outta me if I heard that.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.659
Yeah.

16:05.661 --> 16:08.696
I don't have an explanation for it.

16:08.698 --> 16:10.432
Anything else?

16:10.434 --> 16:12.902
Most recently, my daughter actually was,

16:12.904 --> 16:15.639
like, pushed down the stairs.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.510
Legs went over her head,

16:18.512 --> 16:21.281
and she landed on her head.

16:21.283 --> 16:24.918
I... of course, like, complete shock.
Freaked out.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.223
I was bawling my eyes out.

16:27.225 --> 16:29.627
I wouldn't want her to
experience the things I have.

16:29.629 --> 16:32.828
I worry about that every day.

16:34.497 --> 16:40.266
He's not really aware of the space,
you know, around him.

16:40.268 --> 16:43.372
Indirectly, I think he could hurt people,

16:43.374 --> 16:46.207
like by trying to move them out of the way.

16:49.079 --> 16:51.547
I think that the living are...

16:51.549 --> 16:53.381
kinda caught in a war zone.

17:07.188 --> 17:09.390
Some cases I've gotta do a lot of digging

17:09.392 --> 17:11.358
before I find a death on the property.

17:11.361 --> 17:14.128
Not this one. Took one phone call.

17:14.196 --> 17:16.599
I'm on my way to meet
with a sheriff who said

17:16.602 --> 17:19.507
there was a murder right inside
of Rob and Carol's house.

17:24.046 --> 17:26.814
Turns out there was a homicide
in the house I'm investigating.

17:26.816 --> 17:29.383
Yes. Andrew Fedyck was killed in the house

17:29.385 --> 17:32.183
in January of 1939.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.653
So now what do we know about
this guy Andrew himself?

17:34.655 --> 17:38.086
Andrew and his Bessie
were Austrian immigrants.

17:38.088 --> 17:41.257
They moved into the house in 1929.

17:41.259 --> 17:45.493
They were the parents of
five girls and one boy.

17:45.495 --> 17:46.960
Andrew was a farmer,

17:46.962 --> 17:49.228
and he was known to have a drinking problem.

17:49.230 --> 17:50.796
The night of the homicide,

17:50.798 --> 17:54.066
Andrew came in, and allegedly he was drunk

17:54.068 --> 17:56.169
and had been drinking for several days.

17:56.171 --> 17:58.938
And he was very abusive and boisterous and,
uh,

17:58.940 --> 18:02.744
angry with his wife and
whoever else was in the house.

18:02.746 --> 18:05.481
And, uh, the son, Michael, came in.

18:05.483 --> 18:06.882
And when Michael came in,

18:06.884 --> 18:10.385
it's alleged that his dad
came after him with a knife.

18:10.387 --> 18:12.686
- Okay, so now how old was Michael?
- Michael was 19.

18:12.688 --> 18:14.521
Now I do have a picture of Michael.

18:14.523 --> 18:19.291
A struggle ensues,
and Michael is able to disarm his dad.

18:19.293 --> 18:22.728
But at the time,
then his father turned his rage

18:22.730 --> 18:25.066
toward Bessie, his wife.

18:25.068 --> 18:27.769
She picks up a 12 gauge shotgun.

18:27.771 --> 18:29.504
She gives him a warning.

18:29.506 --> 18:30.504
In fact, she gives him several warnings

18:30.506 --> 18:32.305
and asked him to back off.

18:32.307 --> 18:34.106
He proceeds to come after her,

18:34.108 --> 18:37.610
and she shoots once and
hits him in the chest.

18:37.612 --> 18:40.679
I do have a copy of the death certificate

18:40.681 --> 18:42.613
declaring him dead that night,

18:42.914 --> 18:46.617
with information that he
died from a shotgun blast.

18:46.619 --> 18:49.524
Okay. Homicide, murder by gunshot wounds.

18:49.526 --> 18:52.291
I have the newspaper account.
It was headline news.

18:52.293 --> 18:55.529
The newspaper report
said an autopsy performed

18:55.531 --> 18:58.835
revealed that 156 pellets
of the shotgun shell

18:58.837 --> 19:01.073
had pierced his chest.

19:01.075 --> 19:03.145
So, sheriff, did she get arrested for this?

19:03.147 --> 19:05.183
That night, she's taken into custody

19:05.185 --> 19:08.918
and she's charged with both
homicide and manslaughter.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.290
She's released on bail,
and three months later,

19:12.292 --> 19:14.159
she appears in front of a grand jury.

19:14.161 --> 19:16.895
- Okay.
- She alleges self-defense.

19:16.897 --> 19:21.065
The grand jury believes that
and they don't indict her.

19:23.637 --> 19:25.670
Did they have a relationship in life?

19:25.672 --> 19:30.205
Yes. I'm gonna say she knew
him when she was alive.

19:30.207 --> 19:32.975
I don't know if they were related.

19:32.977 --> 19:35.448
With all this fighting going on,
it's hard to know

19:35.450 --> 19:37.951
how this man and woman
knew each other in life.

19:37.953 --> 19:39.486
But one thing's for sure...

19:39.488 --> 19:41.921
they can't stand each other in death.

19:41.923 --> 19:44.255
She seems afraid of him some,

19:44.257 --> 19:46.657
thinking that he can do [bleep] to her.

19:46.659 --> 19:48.562
Or has done [bleep] to her, you know.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.264
I don't know if he, like,
beats her up or what,

19:51.266 --> 19:53.399
but she tries to get the
[bleep] out of the way.

19:56.603 --> 19:58.502
I am seeing a... it's a funeral.

20:02.342 --> 20:04.176
A wife shoots and kills her husband,

20:04.178 --> 20:06.479
and a grand jury does not indict her.

20:06.481 --> 20:09.915
That just seems odd to me,
especially because it's 1939.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.917
I'm heading over to meet
with a professor in Philly

20:11.919 --> 20:13.588
who'll look into the case for me.

20:21.867 --> 20:23.602
Well, Dr. Ruchti, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate it.

20:23.604 --> 20:24.871
My pleasure.

20:24.873 --> 20:27.574
All right,
so the reason I asked you to help me out

20:27.576 --> 20:28.741
was that I found it odd,

20:28.743 --> 20:29.741
especially as a homicide investigator,

20:29.743 --> 20:32.045
that this woman did not get indicted

20:32.047 --> 20:33.314
for murder charges.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.249
Steve, it is a really interesting case

20:35.251 --> 20:38.118
for the time period, given the fact that

20:38.120 --> 20:41.221
the status of women was subordinate to men

20:41.223 --> 20:42.821
during that time.

20:42.823 --> 20:44.488
And... and that's why I thought it odd

20:44.490 --> 20:45.922
that she didn't get indicted... Right.

20:45.924 --> 20:47.657
'cause I figured, it's 1939.

20:47.659 --> 20:50.396
There was no domestic violence
laws on the books yet.

20:50.398 --> 20:51.732
No, there absolutely was not.

20:51.734 --> 20:53.532
In fact, domestic violence wasn't even

20:53.534 --> 20:55.831
part of our language at that point.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.901
We just called these things "family feuds."

20:57.903 --> 20:59.905
Well, it had to be pretty compelling
'cause I'm assuming

20:59.907 --> 21:01.940
that it had to be an all-male grand jury.

21:01.942 --> 21:03.441
Absolutely.

21:03.443 --> 21:07.347
When you think of somebody as unequal to men,
less than men,

21:07.349 --> 21:09.449
you might think of them as childlike,

21:09.451 --> 21:12.118
not making the same decisions
that you would make.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.489
And they're... looking at
her as if she was a kid.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.425
- And how do you indict a kid?
- Right.

21:17.427 --> 21:20.129
Maybe this grand jury just thought,
you know,

21:20.131 --> 21:22.032
"Well,
she just didn't know what she was doing.

21:22.034 --> 21:23.933
Maybe she lost her mind."

21:23.935 --> 21:25.332
We still see some of this still today,

21:25.334 --> 21:28.905
the argument that women are...
are crazy or irrational.

21:28.907 --> 21:30.273
So, I mean, what's your opinion on it?

21:30.275 --> 21:32.608
- What do you think about it?
- I think it's very clear

21:32.610 --> 21:37.380
that she was being abused by
her husband severely over time.

21:37.382 --> 21:39.081
She's trying to protect herself.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.117
She's trying to protect her children.

21:41.119 --> 21:47.219
And did not want to hurt or
harm or even kill anyone,

21:47.221 --> 21:50.225
let alone her husband,
but felt she had no other choice

21:50.227 --> 21:53.928
because he was coming for her.

21:53.930 --> 21:57.296
He's like, "She was really angry."

21:57.298 --> 21:59.965
I think he...

21:59.967 --> 22:01.833
privately disliked her.

22:03.471 --> 22:05.308
He thought she was nuts.

22:10.115 --> 22:13.151
Yeah, she's done some bad things.

22:13.153 --> 22:15.622
He gets angry at her.

22:15.624 --> 22:17.424
He says that she's crazy.

22:29.746 --> 22:32.012
So far,
I've got a family being terrorized

22:32.014 --> 22:33.345
by unexplained activity

22:33.347 --> 22:36.149
and a property that's been
the site of a homicide.

22:36.151 --> 22:38.919
But there's gotta be something
else that can help my case,

22:38.921 --> 22:41.457
so I'm at the local library.

22:43.127 --> 22:45.193
Searching through old records,
I find a scandal

22:45.195 --> 22:48.933
involving brutal mistreatment
of kids at an orphanage.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.604
Turns out it's right next to

22:50.606 --> 22:53.340
my client's original property lines.

22:53.342 --> 22:55.311
I called the local historian,

22:55.313 --> 22:58.982
and she says it was a scene of neglect,
abuse, and death.

23:05.657 --> 23:08.258
Well, Dr. Giesberg, thanks for meeting me.
I appreciate that.

23:08.260 --> 23:10.125
So the article I came across, uh,

23:10.127 --> 23:12.496
mentioned scandal and abuse in an orphanage

23:12.498 --> 23:14.730
not far from the property I'm investigating.

23:14.732 --> 23:16.864
Uh, what can you tell me about the place?

23:16.866 --> 23:19.469
It opened up, um, in 1868 on the property

23:19.471 --> 23:22.371
of a former Revolutionary War-era hospital.

23:22.373 --> 23:23.637
Oh. Okay.

23:23.639 --> 23:27.476
And here's a photograph
of the school in 1870.

23:28.778 --> 23:32.048
The orphanage in Chester
Springs was one of 35

23:32.050 --> 23:35.251
- operating in the state of Pennsylvania.
- Wow.

23:35.253 --> 23:38.156
Now the article I saw was
sometime in the 1880s.

23:38.158 --> 23:40.224
So when did the scandal actually break?

23:40.226 --> 23:41.892
There were a series of articles, actually,

23:41.894 --> 23:43.861
- published in the 1880s...
- Okay.

23:43.863 --> 23:46.430
uh, reporting abuse at the schools.

23:46.432 --> 23:49.134
- Okay.
- Here are a couple of examples here.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.373
One of these talking about,
uh, kids getting, um,

23:52.375 --> 23:53.808
you know, water tortured

23:53.810 --> 23:57.576
so they can confess to
pulling a prank at the school.

23:57.578 --> 24:01.750
Another one, um, alleging, um, sexual abuse

24:01.752 --> 24:03.919
- at the schools.
- Okay.

24:03.921 --> 24:05.186
This is another article

24:05.188 --> 24:06.652
that was published in a national newspaper

24:06.654 --> 24:08.618
that talked about the
kids not being provided

24:08.620 --> 24:10.850
with adequate food or clothing,

24:10.852 --> 24:14.624
uh, children being neglected
without medical care

24:14.626 --> 24:16.025
and dying in their cells.

24:16.027 --> 24:17.924
- This is worse than a prison.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

24:17.926 --> 24:19.591
The news stories, um,

24:19.593 --> 24:22.959
reported deaths at many of these
schools in... over the years.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.726
So what happens next?

24:24.728 --> 24:27.329
This becomes a political hot potato.

24:27.331 --> 24:29.429
So all the abuse and all
this is still going on?

24:29.431 --> 24:31.761
- That's right.
- All right, so what happens?

24:31.763 --> 24:34.131
So around 1906, um,

24:34.133 --> 24:36.633
the Chester Springs, uh,
Civil War Orphan Home

24:36.635 --> 24:38.801
is finally closed.

24:38.803 --> 24:41.472
Here's our article talking
about its last commencement.

24:41.474 --> 24:43.539
Okay. Did anybody go to prison?

24:43.541 --> 24:46.040
Or was it just basically
"you're out of a job now"?

24:46.042 --> 24:47.074
These guys mostly just lost their jobs.

24:47.076 --> 24:48.874
- That's it.
- That's right.

24:55.350 --> 24:58.019
There's, like, some...

24:58.021 --> 24:59.986
boys?

24:59.988 --> 25:04.459
These guys are, like, beating up this, uh...

25:04.461 --> 25:06.792
you know, they're kids, though.
They're kids.

25:06.794 --> 25:08.394
They're beatin' the [bleep] outta this guy.

25:10.164 --> 25:12.598
Beatin' the [bleep] out of him.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.436
This is bad over here.

25:16.409 --> 25:20.010
Ow!!

25:20.012 --> 25:21.848
Ohh.

25:23.018 --> 25:24.486
Whoa, that hurt.

25:24.488 --> 25:26.088
Somebody lost their hearing.

25:26.090 --> 25:27.520
His whole body's on the ground.

25:27.522 --> 25:29.320
I think he's dehydrated.

25:29.322 --> 25:30.988
And there's blood.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.122
He's young. He's young.

25:34.392 --> 25:36.559
He's, like, a kid.

25:36.561 --> 25:39.130
Oh, that [bleep] hurt, man.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.333
I think he's delirious.

25:52.110 --> 25:54.844
During my walk,
I was caught in the middle

25:54.846 --> 25:57.313
of a feud between a dead man and woman.

25:57.315 --> 25:58.881
I'm meeting with an artist to describe

25:58.883 --> 26:02.018
how their battles affect the living.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.054
Dead lady is kind of on the wall.

26:04.056 --> 26:07.420
And she's weird. Very strange-looking.

26:07.422 --> 26:11.589
She pretty much has a skull for a face.

26:14.959 --> 26:18.460
And there's a dead man across the room,
screaming at her.

26:20.462 --> 26:23.296
The living lady is freaking out.

26:25.799 --> 26:28.166
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:28.168 --> 26:31.104
Yes, that's what I saw.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.280
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:55.282 --> 26:57.414
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

26:57.416 --> 27:00.318
and our clients for the first time.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.987
Well, Amy, you're sitting across from, uh,

27:01.989 --> 27:03.752
what I consider a family in crisis.

27:03.754 --> 27:06.489
Uh, this is Rob, that's his wife Carol,

27:06.491 --> 27:09.558
and this is their daughter Kelly,
their oldest.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.093
Now Kelly doesn't live here anymore.

27:11.095 --> 27:13.198
And these are their other two children.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.102
This is Heather, who's away at college,

27:16.104 --> 27:17.938
uh, and this is Kyle, who's...14 now?

27:17.940 --> 27:19.442
- 14.
- Yep.

27:19.444 --> 27:21.512
He still lives here.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.714
You should know that the
activity is so bad here,

27:23.716 --> 27:26.018
it's ruining Carol's health,

27:26.020 --> 27:29.454
and it's basically tearing the family apart.

27:29.456 --> 27:31.488
And they told me that
we are their last hope.

27:31.490 --> 27:34.790
So now that Amy knows a
little bit about...

27:34.792 --> 27:35.958
what's going on here,

27:35.960 --> 27:37.995
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

27:37.997 --> 27:44.001
When I first got here,
I encountered a female.

27:44.003 --> 27:48.771
Her energy is just... off the charts.

27:48.773 --> 27:51.707
She's absolutely in constant motion.

27:51.709 --> 27:54.243
She looks... strange.

27:54.245 --> 27:57.410
Her face was basically just a skull.

27:57.412 --> 28:01.348
Her arms and legs were extraordinarily long

28:01.350 --> 28:03.750
and kind of spiderlike.

28:03.752 --> 28:05.085
Definitely one of the...

28:05.087 --> 28:07.253
the major things that I got from her

28:07.255 --> 28:09.455
is that she can make the living by sick.

28:11.493 --> 28:14.664
She... latched on to me.

28:14.666 --> 28:18.764
I was sweating and I felt, like, the fever.

28:18.766 --> 28:21.905
And I felt like I had, you know, a flu.

28:23.843 --> 28:26.208
Oh. This is the...
one of the main reasons we're here,

28:26.210 --> 28:28.211
because your health has deteriorated

28:28.213 --> 28:29.913
since she's moved in.

28:29.915 --> 28:33.251
Now you look at her,
she... she looks like the epitome of fit.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.453
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

28:34.455 --> 28:36.488
And even the doctors, on paper, say you...

28:36.490 --> 28:37.689
there's nothing wrong.

28:37.691 --> 28:39.422
I look great on paper.

28:39.424 --> 28:42.893
But I just feel pains... migraines,

28:42.895 --> 28:45.062
random pain, sometimes out of the blue.

28:45.064 --> 28:46.230
Interesting.

28:46.232 --> 28:49.533
And what about severe anxiety,
hyperactivity,

28:49.535 --> 28:52.571
then feeling extremely drained?

28:52.573 --> 28:54.041
- I would say that's...
- Kelly has a lot of anxiety.

28:54.043 --> 28:55.845
that's actually more Kelly.

28:55.847 --> 28:58.680
That sound right, Kel?

28:58.682 --> 29:01.985
Yeah.
It's just hard to hear it.

29:01.987 --> 29:06.557
The living should not be at all
interacting with this female

29:06.559 --> 29:09.592
because her energy is so severe

29:09.594 --> 29:13.030
and there's so much death
entangled in her energy.

29:13.032 --> 29:15.966
At one point, I almost had to stop the walk

29:15.968 --> 29:19.836
because I felt like I was gonna
have a [bleep] heart attack.

29:19.838 --> 29:25.806
Carol gets these intense
chest pains from time to time.

29:27.510 --> 29:28.745
Told Rob about 'em. He took me to the E.R.

29:28.747 --> 29:31.180
Well, that's a smart move.

29:31.182 --> 29:32.980
So it <i> is</i> a real threat

29:32.982 --> 29:38.685
because she really can induce that.

29:38.687 --> 29:40.151
Wow.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.453
So that is making me very nervous.

29:43.455 --> 29:46.424
Now would the living be able to see her?

29:46.426 --> 29:51.262
Yes. They would see her
like a brown misty thing.

29:51.264 --> 29:54.799
I've seen it as the mist now.

29:54.801 --> 30:00.137
I've seen it as a, like,
2 to 3 foot mass upstairs,

30:00.139 --> 30:03.540
and I've seen it as a shadow figure walking.

30:03.542 --> 30:04.874
Wow.

30:04.876 --> 30:07.573
The other thing was,
the woman was talking about

30:07.575 --> 30:10.208
torturing this... this girl.

30:10.210 --> 30:13.772
Uh, she was saying it was because

30:13.774 --> 30:19.043
she was disrespectful and
didn't have any manners,

30:19.045 --> 30:21.508
so she was trying to teach her a lesson.

30:21.510 --> 30:24.279
She kind of looked like you.

30:25.516 --> 30:26.747
Yeah.

30:26.749 --> 30:28.981
Those words hit it right on the head,
I'd say.

30:28.983 --> 30:32.384
Yeah, our relationship deteriorated a lot

30:32.386 --> 30:34.051
for several years...

30:34.053 --> 30:36.018
- Mm-hmm.
- once we moved in here.

30:36.020 --> 30:40.086
And a lot of times,
Rob would... it made it difficult

30:40.088 --> 30:43.321
because he would ask
perhaps what I perhaps did

30:43.323 --> 30:45.690
to set things off with Kelly.

30:45.692 --> 30:49.760
Do you feel like she was
being kind of different

30:49.762 --> 30:55.502
or overly controlling or
overly aggressive with you?

30:55.504 --> 30:58.105
Obviously,
you guys are being influenced like crazy

30:58.107 --> 30:59.672
by her.

30:59.674 --> 31:02.875
And it affected your marriage as well, right?
The whole thing?

31:02.877 --> 31:08.283
Un, during that time,
it affected the <i> entire</i> family.

31:08.285 --> 31:09.817
It came to the point

31:09.819 --> 31:12.118
where you guys actually asked her to leave.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.389
Or basically told her to leave, right?

31:14.391 --> 31:15.725
I didn't <i> want</i> to do it.

31:17.895 --> 31:19.927
I- I love my daughter,

31:19.929 --> 31:22.164
but it was overwhelming.

31:22.166 --> 31:23.699
Here, baby.

31:23.701 --> 31:25.369
Thank you.

31:27.607 --> 31:31.012
Neither of them could figure
out a way to not escalate

31:31.014 --> 31:34.450
from the smallest argument to a big,
gigantic...

31:34.452 --> 31:35.719
nuclear war.

31:35.721 --> 31:38.221
And as the dad,
I was caught in the middle of it.

31:38.223 --> 31:41.125
It's just scary to think that, like...

31:41.127 --> 31:44.796
something you can't explain
or you can't really see,

31:44.798 --> 31:47.198
you don't know what it is,
can affect you that way.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.466
Mm-hmm.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.903
So one of the things

31:54.905 --> 31:58.574
that this dead woman was indicating to me

31:58.576 --> 32:01.044
was that...

32:01.046 --> 32:04.648
she's being tortured by
another dead person here.

32:04.650 --> 32:08.885
This deceased male,
she absolutely hates him.

32:08.887 --> 32:13.390
I saw him standing at the top of the stairs,

32:13.392 --> 32:16.427
by the master bedroom, just watching me.

32:16.429 --> 32:18.997
I could hear doors slamming.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.663
He does this.

32:20.665 --> 32:23.268
That happens a lot.

32:23.270 --> 32:26.305
The other thing... um,
you would also see him

32:26.307 --> 32:29.540
as a large, black mist.

32:29.542 --> 32:34.581
And she came back and was
saying how she hated him.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.882
She's like, "He scratches people.

32:36.884 --> 32:39.688
He's worse because he scratches people.
He torments me."

32:39.690 --> 32:42.657
He's calling her a liar.
She's calling him a liar.

32:42.659 --> 32:46.396
You know,
I don't know who... who to b... who to believe.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.731
Well, your walk is nailing

32:47.733 --> 32:50.701
about everything that's
going on in this house.

32:50.703 --> 32:52.503
Rob, do me a favor

32:52.505 --> 32:54.640
and just tell Amy how you
think you got these marks.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.708
One morning, I came out of the shower

32:58.710 --> 33:00.642
and I turned around, and Carol said,

33:00.644 --> 33:03.913
"You've got big scratches on your back.
How did that happen?"

33:03.915 --> 33:08.484
Could this thing also bruise?
Like, cause bruises?

33:08.486 --> 33:12.389
Yeah. And the feeling of being shoved,
pushed, pulled,

33:12.391 --> 33:13.958
you know...

33:13.960 --> 33:16.061
does that resonate with you?

33:17.965 --> 33:19.366
Tell Amy exactly what happened,

33:19.368 --> 33:21.569
because the way you described
it to me did not sound normal.

33:21.571 --> 33:23.104
Mnh-mnh.

33:23.106 --> 33:25.341
Lila, my daughter,

33:25.343 --> 33:28.143
we were going down the stairs
on that side of the house,

33:28.145 --> 33:31.182
and it literally looked like someone, like,

33:31.184 --> 33:33.187
put both hands, like,
on the back of her shoulders

33:33.189 --> 33:35.286
and shoved her down, and, like...

33:35.288 --> 33:39.992
she, like,
flipped and landed on her head on the stairs.

33:39.994 --> 33:42.595
I... completely lost it.

33:42.597 --> 33:48.067
That is probably coming from her.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.438
- It explains a lot, actually.
- A lot.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.173
Yeah, a lot.

33:52.175 --> 33:56.612
Well, these two dead people
really hate each other.

33:56.614 --> 34:01.084
Unfortunately,
you guys get caught in the middle,

34:01.086 --> 34:05.858
and some physical trauma is
caused by them inadvertently.

34:05.860 --> 34:07.760
I had a-a sketch artist draw

34:07.762 --> 34:10.732
kind of an example of a situation,

34:10.734 --> 34:13.304
specifically in the master bedroom.

34:22.188 --> 34:24.489
Oh,..

34:24.491 --> 34:26.056
Holy crap.

34:30.495 --> 34:31.996
It's creepy.

34:31.998 --> 34:33.868
Kinda makes you feel sick.

34:33.870 --> 34:37.106
Now how would they feel

34:37.108 --> 34:38.672
with them two fight...
the two dead fighting...

34:38.674 --> 34:41.109
Just like when I'm... like, they would feel,

34:41.110 --> 34:43.677
you know, unsettled, uncomfortable, anxious.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.245
It would kinda explain why I don't...

34:46.246 --> 34:48.449
I don't feel at rest.

34:48.451 --> 34:49.951
I'm never comfortable.

34:49.953 --> 34:52.754
I always feel like there's eyes on me.

34:52.755 --> 34:53.987
Mm-hmm.

34:53.989 --> 34:55.652
Now did get anything from
when they were alive?

34:55.655 --> 34:59.825
They somehow knew each other
when they were both alive.

35:01.061 --> 35:05.129
He always... felt that she was a bitch,

35:05.131 --> 35:07.197
that she was very mean to people.

35:07.199 --> 35:10.966
But, you know,
she definitely has a fear of him

35:10.968 --> 35:13.801
because he beat her when she was alive.

35:13.803 --> 35:16.601
Well, listening to
everything you had to say,

35:16.603 --> 35:18.803
I kinda have an idea already
who you're talking about.

35:18.805 --> 35:22.041
In 1929, Andrew and Bessie Fedyck

35:22.043 --> 35:25.611
moved into your house with their kids.

35:25.613 --> 35:29.381
Andrew was a laborer and rumored
to be a pretty bad drunk.

35:29.383 --> 35:31.383
There is evidence that suggests

35:31.385 --> 35:33.586
that he may have been
pretty abusive as well.

35:33.588 --> 35:36.988
On January 3, 1939,

35:36.990 --> 35:39.927
Andrew came home drunk and
got into an altercation,

35:39.929 --> 35:41.697
and his son came home... Michael.

35:41.699 --> 35:45.798
And the fight he got into
with his son escalated

35:45.800 --> 35:49.037
where Andrew had a knife
and tried to attack his son.

35:49.039 --> 35:51.775
Michael was able to get the knife away,

35:51.777 --> 35:56.011
and Andrew turned his rage
towards his wife Bessie.

35:56.013 --> 35:59.381
Now she picks up a 12 gauge shotgun

35:59.383 --> 36:01.182
and begs him to stop.

36:01.184 --> 36:03.884
He continues coming at her...

36:03.886 --> 36:08.059
and she fires one round...
12 gauge shotgun...

36:08.061 --> 36:09.493
into his chest.

36:09.495 --> 36:11.094
Wow.

36:11.096 --> 36:13.395
That happened right here in this house.

36:13.397 --> 36:15.163
Wow.

36:15.165 --> 36:17.430
I have his death certificate here.

36:17.432 --> 36:20.202
Now this homicide was front page news.

36:20.204 --> 36:23.602
I actually have an article
about what happened.

36:25.538 --> 36:27.739
Bessie was immediately arrested.

36:27.741 --> 36:30.173
She testifies at the grand jury,

36:30.175 --> 36:32.141
and they don't indict her.

36:32.143 --> 36:33.642
Self-defense?

36:33.644 --> 36:34.909
Yeah, basically.

36:34.911 --> 36:37.977
You know,
in my experience working domestic violence

36:37.979 --> 36:40.313
for over 20 years on the streets,

36:40.315 --> 36:41.915
this is not something that just happened.

36:41.917 --> 36:45.247
This was abuse going on for years.

36:45.249 --> 36:47.616
This may sound just ridiculous,

36:47.618 --> 36:53.351
but I was actually hoping
that there was something...

36:53.353 --> 36:54.518
factual that could explain

36:54.520 --> 36:56.823
a lot of this nutsy stuff that's going on.

36:56.825 --> 36:59.993
I'm just shocked,
and that they're still fighting

36:59.995 --> 37:01.161
and it's still happening

37:01.163 --> 37:02.662
and they're still influencing people.

37:06.705 --> 37:08.805
So anything else?

37:08.807 --> 37:10.172
Just a quick question.

37:10.174 --> 37:11.607
I mean, did you spend a
lot of time in the barn

37:11.609 --> 37:14.744
or around the barn when you were younger?

37:14.746 --> 37:16.880
Um, yeah, 'cause we had horses.

37:16.882 --> 37:19.216
Okay. I got it.

37:19.218 --> 37:22.621
Okay.

37:22.623 --> 37:25.490
There's something else that's
also influencing this area,

37:25.492 --> 37:28.027
and... and that might have something to do

37:28.029 --> 37:30.129
with what happened here.

37:30.131 --> 37:32.563
I was drawn right to the barn,

37:32.565 --> 37:35.167
and the dead lady actually wrapped her...

37:35.169 --> 37:38.105
her arms around my waist and pulled me back.

37:38.107 --> 37:41.139
And she's like,
"You <i> don't</i> wanna go in there."

37:42.475 --> 37:44.043
And she goes, "You know,
if you go in that barn,

37:44.045 --> 37:46.245
you're gonna die."

37:46.247 --> 37:48.179
I did feel very unnerved.

37:48.181 --> 37:50.247
She was telling me that, um,

37:50.249 --> 37:52.184
there was something in the barn, uh,

37:52.186 --> 37:54.487
that has done a great deal of harm,

37:54.489 --> 37:56.753
that it absolutely was not good.

37:56.755 --> 38:00.355
What I saw was like this small black ball.

38:01.857 --> 38:03.090
And then I saw it, like,

38:03.092 --> 38:05.592
kind of go into, like, a snake form.

38:05.594 --> 38:08.429
It did then take the shape

38:08.431 --> 38:12.399
of a very solid kind of shadow person,

38:12.401 --> 38:13.632
but it's not a shadow person.

38:15.868 --> 38:17.669
What I would call it is a demon.

38:35.253 --> 38:36.586
It did take the shape

38:36.588 --> 38:40.823
of a very solid kind of shadow person,

38:40.825 --> 38:42.158
but it's not a shadow person.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.267
What I would call it is a demon.

38:52.339 --> 38:54.573
The thing is, is that by you being, like,

38:54.575 --> 38:56.943
so out there all the time,

38:56.945 --> 38:58.978
like, it's something
that could've absolutely

38:58.980 --> 39:00.314
influenced your behavior

39:00.316 --> 39:03.451
and could've taken over slightly even.

39:03.453 --> 39:08.224
Uh, it is something that could
have influenced these people.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.275
Not feeling good about
what's going on right now.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.376
No.

39:21.378 --> 39:23.780
It's like Grand Central Station for evil.

39:23.782 --> 39:27.280
Its mission here is to destroy
as many people as possible.

39:28.549 --> 39:31.784
Now do you think the demon in the barn

39:31.786 --> 39:33.186
was attached to Kelly?

39:33.188 --> 39:34.721
- Yes, I think it was.
- You do.

39:36.090 --> 39:40.330
Well, Lila spends a lot of time by the barn.

39:40.332 --> 39:44.233
Al the time. She loves following the cats.

39:44.235 --> 39:45.800
I think I'm in shock.

39:49.873 --> 39:51.974
Well, guys,
your family's been plagued with questions

39:51.976 --> 39:53.709
for years now.

39:53.711 --> 39:54.744
Why have you been so sick, Carol?

39:54.746 --> 39:56.980
Why did you act out, Kelly?

39:56.982 --> 39:59.517
And, Rob, you know, why you got scratched.

39:59.519 --> 40:01.018
At least you have answers now.

40:01.020 --> 40:03.854
But the big question is, can you stay here

40:03.856 --> 40:06.055
in a calm, peaceful environment

40:06.057 --> 40:07.390
and live your lives happily

40:07.392 --> 40:10.458
and have you granddaughter
come over and be safe?

40:10.460 --> 40:12.760
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to my partner Amy

40:12.762 --> 40:14.396
and see if she has a resolution for us.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.936
There are several things that you need to do

40:18.938 --> 40:21.504
in order to make this a safer environment.

40:21.506 --> 40:28.277
So in order to remove the
demon in the barn area,

40:28.279 --> 40:31.986
I would like there to be a
Catholic priest who comes in.

40:31.988 --> 40:37.392
He's going to do an exorcism
of the barn and the property.

40:37.394 --> 40:42.500
He does need to make a very firm statement

40:42.502 --> 40:45.535
that he is <i> not</i> including

40:45.537 --> 40:50.041
the removal of any dead people

40:50.043 --> 40:51.676
from this location.

40:51.678 --> 40:56.949
So my hope is that he actually
gets rid of this thing,

40:56.951 --> 40:58.478
but he may not.

40:58.480 --> 41:03.549
Uh, he may just get rid
of it from your property.

41:03.551 --> 41:07.784
The next day, I want there to
be a physical medium that comes

41:07.786 --> 41:11.481
to remove the deceased male
and female from the house.

41:11.483 --> 41:13.417
It could take several days,

41:13.419 --> 41:15.514
uh, for it to happen

41:15.516 --> 41:18.517
just because there's going
to be a lot of arguing

41:18.519 --> 41:23.822
between the medium and probably
both of the dead people.

41:23.824 --> 41:25.389
Now with all that said and done,

41:25.391 --> 41:27.325
will she start feeling better and...

41:27.327 --> 41:29.828
Yes. The difference will be insane.

41:29.830 --> 41:33.865
It'll be a huge, <i>huge</i> difference.

41:33.867 --> 41:38.671
We're all highly motivated
to move all this on.

41:38.673 --> 41:41.039
It'd be so nice to be able to come home

41:41.041 --> 41:43.042
and feel like it's a home,

41:43.044 --> 41:45.715
because I don't have that feeling.

41:47.284 --> 41:49.417
It's nice to have some answers.

41:49.419 --> 41:52.553
Kinda gives you some closure
to that chapter of your life.

41:52.555 --> 41:55.626
I really hope Carol
and Rob follow my advice

41:55.628 --> 41:58.627
and deal with the entities
terrorizing their family.

41:58.629 --> 42:00.629
With the help of a priest and a medium,

42:00.631 --> 42:02.032
they should be able to free themselves

42:02.034 --> 42:04.703
of the darkness surrounding their home.
