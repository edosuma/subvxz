00:43.043 --> 00:46.963
<i>She moved out of her apartment.</i>
<i>She left her job at</i> Vanity Fair.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.257
None of her friends or family will talk.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.967
-Who?
-Who do you think?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.845
Still obsessed with Rachel?
You've got to let that go.

00:53.928 --> 00:57.432
She is the only one
of Anna's friends named in the complaint,

00:57.515 --> 00:59.601
I need her. And she is ghosting me.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.936
-You don't need her.
-I told her that.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.064
Fine, I want her.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.732
Code Paul. Code Paul.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.358
-Paul.
-Hi, Paul.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.820
You on safari? Come to see the locals?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.405
Slumming it in Scriberia?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.032
Barry, come on. I'm sorry.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.867
What he means, Paul, is…

01:16.618 --> 01:18.745
we don't like you. Go away.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.833
I was just…
Vivian, how's the story going?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.878
-Good. Great.
-How done are you with the article?

01:26.961 --> 01:29.422
-Almost done.
-Is there a draft I can read?

01:29.506 --> 01:30.924
No. I'm in the middle of it.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.510
Uh, you know, inside it.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.304
So, my process and all.
No draft to show you.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.222
But soon.

01:37.305 --> 01:41.434
There's an obvious deadline.
I mean, when is… all of that happening?

01:42.393 --> 01:44.354
My baby is due in three weeks.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.398
So, uh, I need the article ASAP.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.735
We'll need extra time.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.406
A lot of fact checking on this one.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.536
And you of all people should know
how important fact checking is.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.789
I got it.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.417
Bye. Go. Shoo.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.341
We have stories of our own
to write, deadlines.

02:13.424 --> 02:16.136
I don't have time
for you to be telling that frat-boy lies.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.179
Wait a minute. She's right.

02:18.263 --> 02:22.016
-That baby's due in two weeks.
-And the draft is not almost done.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.019
-She hasn't started writing yet.
-You selfish little bitch.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.479
I have a Trump think piece.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.148
Do you? A think piece on Trump.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.150
You proud of that? Feeling original?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.609
I need Rachel.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.112
You don't have her.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.322
People don't just disappear.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.699
This girl lives online.

02:37.782 --> 02:41.786
She'd die without Instagramming
her hair or her shoes, or whatever.

02:41.870 --> 02:46.124
She's got to be on Instagram or something.
I bet you she's still liking posts.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.669
Nothing. No Facebook, Insta, Snap.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.589
Twitter, Weibo, Tumblr, none of it.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.633
If a source won't come through,
build the story without 'em.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.052
You've got enough without Rachel. Right?

02:58.136 --> 02:59.179
Yes.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.723
No. Maybe.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.308
It's just better with Rachel.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.392
She's right.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.728
Without Rachel to corroborate,
this story's not as good.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.980
-Marrakesh for sure.
-I don't agree.

03:09.063 --> 03:10.690
Kacy's account is color enough.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.192
She was there.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.194
-For part of it.
-Well, she was there.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.780
Yeah, she was there at the beginning,
but not for very long.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.241
-What's the deal here?
-Kacy comes back.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.912
-I don't think she's a reliable witness.
-We want to get started writing.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.496
Barry, for God's sake.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.878
Look, just start writing.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.839
We'll find Rachel.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.717
If you build it, she will come.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.012
Go.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.035
<i>It started with money,</i>
<i>as it so often does in New York.</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:14.295
<i>A crisp $100 bill</i>
<i>slipped across the smooth surface</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:18.091
<i>of the mid-century-inspired</i>
<i>concierge desk at 12 George.</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:23.513
<i>Later, Kacy Duke would recognize this</i>

04:23.596 --> 04:25.765
<i>as a substantial gift from the Universe.</i>

04:39.946 --> 04:41.948
-I'm sorry. What?

04:42.031 --> 04:44.701
-I don't know what you're saying.
-Damn it, come here.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.830
<i>I have a friend</i>
<i>who I thought might know something,</i>

04:48.913 --> 04:52.000
so I called her and checked in
and she dug around and…

04:53.084 --> 04:54.877
She just called me back and…

04:54.961 --> 04:55.962
You're killing me.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.840
I found Rachel,
and I know why she's not talking to you.

04:58.923 --> 04:59.757
What?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.136
She's dead? In a coma? What?

05:04.012 --> 05:06.097
Rachel sold her story to <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:08.558
Mother fu--

05:41.090 --> 05:43.092


06:13.915 --> 06:14.832
God.

06:29.806 --> 06:30.681
Okay.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.405
<i>You have</i>
<i>reached Anna Delvey, leave a message.</i>

06:45.488 --> 06:47.240
Anna, it's me.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.535
Um, I'm back in New York
so if you could wire me that money,

06:50.618 --> 06:51.953
that would be great.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.204
Thanks, talk later.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.549
Look, it happens all the time.
It doesn't mean your story's dead.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.968
It doesn't mean her story's alive either.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.971
Who's writing it?
Do we know who's writing it?

07:10.054 --> 07:11.389
My friend didn't have that intel.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.350
If it's someone like Nancy Jo Sales,
then I'm fucked.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.560
Yeah, that'd sink you.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.270
Damn it, I need to tell Landon.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.856
-No.
-You don't think I should tell Landon?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.399
What if Paul finds out first?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.694
-Can your story stand on its own?
-Yeah.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.073
God. I think so. Maybe.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.201
-You've done some great reporting.
-I'm not done writing it.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.120
You don't say a word to Landon.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.413
Lou?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.332
They're right. Let's shut up.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.044
No one says anything to Paul or Landon.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.297
Let's see the <i>Vanity Fair</i> piece first.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.009
We need to know
what you're up against.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.051
When does it come out?

07:49.135 --> 07:51.846
Print's out this week,
but online drops sometime today.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.077
Nice tan.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.871
Your Insta pictures were fire.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.123
-Thanks.
-Come on, spill the details, girl.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.168
I'm so jealous.
I've always wanted to go to Marrakesh.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.170
-Was it amazing?
-It was nice.

08:24.253 --> 08:27.006
Oh, my God, how did you swing La Mamounia?

08:27.089 --> 08:28.799
Did you get a secret zaddy?

08:28.883 --> 08:31.260
I'm sorry, guys,
my inbox is crazy and I have to work.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.845
-Spoil sport.
-I need to get to work.

08:32.929 --> 08:33.971
Uh, Rachel.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.681
Noah, what are you…

08:35.765 --> 08:37.892
I'm meeting
one of the photography editors.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.728
Marrakesh was crazy. Right?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.480
How are you?

08:43.022 --> 08:44.607
I might have, like, PTSD.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.485
They charged my card
with the full amount.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.488
-What the fuck?
-Right? But Anna will fix it.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.531
It's fine.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.742
I've got to go to this meeting.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.827
Do you want to grab dinner sometime?

08:59.830 --> 09:00.706
I can't.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.918
I'll see you around.

09:16.264 --> 09:20.851
<i>Anna, still no wire.</i>
<i>Have to pay work credit card ASAP.</i>

09:26.232 --> 09:28.901
<i>Oh, no! So sorry, bank screw up.</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:31.445
<i>I'm traveling. Wire arriving tomorrow.</i>

09:31.529 --> 09:32.863
<i>Sorry about screw up.</i>

09:34.574 --> 09:37.159
-Rachel.
-Oh. Coming.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.339
Heads up, here we go.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.846
<i>"As an added bonus,</i>
<i>she paid for everything."</i>

09:58.222 --> 09:59.807
Wait, she wrote it herself?

10:02.226 --> 10:03.978
It's a first-hand account.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.897
She wrote it herself.
This is really good for us.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.650
Kent!
We got scooped by <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

10:09.734 --> 10:11.444
He does not seem to think so.

10:11.527 --> 10:12.403
Oh, shit.

10:15.948 --> 10:16.782
Mmm.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.123
People are going to lose their minds.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.168
<i>Still no wire.</i>

10:27.251 --> 10:28.878
<i>Bank fuck-up. It's coming.</i>

10:29.420 --> 10:31.339
<i>Anna, I could get in trouble.</i>

10:31.422 --> 10:35.635
<i>It was sent today.</i>
<i>I can send you confirmation slip.</i>

10:37.928 --> 10:38.929
Rachel.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.016
-I'm sorry.
-What is with you these days?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.436
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

10:45.519 --> 10:46.896
<i>It's coming.</i>

10:46.979 --> 10:49.357
<i>Small problem</i>
<i>with international transfers.</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:51.025
<i>Anna, what's going on?</i>

10:51.901 --> 10:53.861
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Everything's cool.</i>

10:53.944 --> 10:55.571
<i>You'll have the money by Monday.</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:57.782
I asked for next month's photos.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.575
Sorry.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.249
<i>Anna, I need the money back.</i>

11:07.333 --> 11:10.169
<i>Minor delay.</i>
<i>Fixing it now. So sorry.</i>

11:10.252 --> 11:12.296
<i>Wire will be completed today.</i>

11:12.380 --> 11:13.631
<i>Had to move hotels.</i>

11:13.714 --> 11:15.174
<i>Beekman, so basic.</i>

11:16.467 --> 11:17.301
Rachel.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.221
Rachel.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.141
If you won't focus,
I'll find someone else to assist me.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.643
You're just in my way right now.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.729
Come on.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.070
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Anna Delvey. Leave a message.</i>

11:36.654 --> 11:39.031
Anna, it's been three months.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.618
Okay, I need that $62,000.
I have to pay off my work credit card.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.829
I've used up all my money
on the minimum payments.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.540
Okay, please, Anna,
you have to pay me back.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.256
I'm not
insulting the <i>Vanity Fair</i> piece,

11:55.339 --> 11:56.841
I'm not saying it's bad journalism.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.926
I'm saying it's not journalism at all.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.053
Because Rachel wrote it herself.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.972
She's not a writer or a journalist.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.181
We still got scooped.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.100
No, this is not scooped.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.436
It's not a real article.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.437
There's no facts,

12:09.520 --> 12:11.981
there's no research,
there's no interviews.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.401
She's just complaining about her friend.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.904
It's basically
an email girls trip gone wrong.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.156
Which goes to my point

12:20.239 --> 12:22.992
about lack of content
and interest in a story like this.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.495
Paul, her piece lacks content.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.247
Rachel is in the dark.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.542
She's got no clue about the banks,

12:31.625 --> 12:34.670
the law firms
or the true scale of what Anna did.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.839
My piece is about the swindle

12:36.922 --> 12:39.467
that is the American dream
in the 21st century.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.261
I am talking
about the theft of our ideals.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.347
The stealing of a presidency,
the fetters on female ambition.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.558
It's about
why scam culture is here to stay.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.268
My story has a place.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.353
It has a right to exist.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.607
Your pages have something.

12:56.901 --> 12:57.818
But I don't know.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.487
I feel…

13:01.155 --> 13:03.282
like we should just cut our losses.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.283
Landon.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.577
Landon.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.376
Keep writing.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.170
Finish the story.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.466
-Then I'll decide.
-Thank you.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.860
-I'm glad you called.
-I'm glad you were free.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.154
Good to see you.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.198
Away from all that crazy.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.157
Right.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
Uh, what do you have coming up?

13:49.328 --> 13:52.873
Mmm, this buddy of mine, uh,
his band's playing Glastonbury.

13:52.957 --> 13:53.791
Cool, right?

13:54.458 --> 13:58.921
So, uh, they want me to go on the road
and take photos and document it.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.382
-Amazing.
-Yeah. How about you?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.553
I have no idea what I'm doing.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.764
I'm still waiting for Anna to pay me back.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.724
Wow. She hasn't paid you back?

14:11.809 --> 14:13.352
I've been hiding it.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.812
At work…

14:14.895 --> 14:16.647
I don't know how much longer I…

14:16.730 --> 14:20.359
She said she was staying at the Beekman,
but I don't think she's there anymore.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.779
It's not like I'm asking her
to deliver cash to me by hand.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.949
I just need her
to push a button or make a call.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.453
I don't even know where she is.
I hope she's okay.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.207
Rach, you've got to look out for yourself.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.668
What do you mean?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.379
Anna's my friend.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.715
After everything
that went down in Marrakesh,

14:42.798 --> 14:44.758
that you continue to call her that…

14:46.051 --> 14:47.177
Anna's not your friend

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
or she wouldn't have
put you through all that.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.598
She definitely puts herself first.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.433
Well, she's different. That's all.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.728
She exists on a different plane,
but she is good for it.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.397
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.733
Everything's going to be fine.

15:13.829 --> 15:14.830
Big night out?

15:14.914 --> 15:15.748
Oh, uh…

15:16.540 --> 15:18.334
I was… I couldn't sleep.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.961
Living your best life.
I see you, Rachel Williams.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.055


15:34.391 --> 15:35.643
Oh, thank God.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.943
What the hell?

15:56.538 --> 15:59.541
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Anna Delvey. Leave a message.</i>

16:00.084 --> 16:01.043
Anna…

16:02.753 --> 16:03.671
Am I interrupting?

16:03.754 --> 16:06.799
Um, hi, Linda. Did you need something?

16:06.882 --> 16:10.010
I'm trying to get my steps for the day.
Figured I'd walk down.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.471
Did you get my email from last week?

16:12.554 --> 16:13.764
The week before?

16:13.847 --> 16:16.392
Oh, my God. Did I miss something?

16:16.475 --> 16:21.230
I'm sorry. Clara has this big trip.
I've been booking flights and travel.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.231
Um…

16:22.314 --> 16:23.232
Three countries.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.942
I had a message from AmEx.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.278
Something about
an unpaid balance on your corporate card.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.405
Oh.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.489
Mine?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.869
Look, Marco's doing
his quarterly checks next week,

16:35.953 --> 16:38.747
so you'd better pay
whatever needs paying by then.

16:38.831 --> 16:42.126
Definitely. I'll have everything cleared.
I must have forgotten.

16:42.793 --> 16:43.627
Sure.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.471
Come on.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.937
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Anna Delvey. Leave a message.</i>

17:02.021 --> 17:04.481
Look, Anna, it's me.

17:04.565 --> 17:08.110
You only sent 5,000, what about the rest?
I need the rest of the money.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.446
Look, someone at work knows.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.614
Anna, call me back. Please.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.324
I am losing my mind here.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.659
I have to pay that bill.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.372
Sorry, sorry.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.166
All this time Anna was where?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.377
She'd left the Beekman, right?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.379
Anna gets back from abroad.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.049
The 12 George
won't have anything to do with her,

17:30.132 --> 17:31.717
so she checks into the Beekman.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.968
No surprises.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.804
It takes less than a month
for the people at the Beekman

17:35.888 --> 17:39.224
to realize
Anna's not the bill-paying type.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.810
After that, she decamps for the W.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.690
This is really good stuff.
You could use this, Vivian.

17:49.109 --> 17:50.527
Where are you going?

17:51.195 --> 17:52.196
Uh…

17:52.905 --> 17:54.782
I'll be back. I thought of something.

17:56.742 --> 18:01.747
So, this whole time Rachel's trying
to get her money back, Anna's homeless.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.125
Missing wire transfers
from hotel to hotel.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.752
The luxurious hobo.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.047
Exactly. Not that Rachel knew that.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.762
Hi, this is Vivian Kent for Dr. Harris.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.557
Can you tell her
to meet me at the hospital?

18:20.641 --> 18:21.767
Something's happening.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.368
Something you want to tell me?

18:40.911 --> 18:44.665
You let her spend $62,000
on your company AmEx?

18:44.748 --> 18:45.666
I didn't let her.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.794
I mean, I did,
but she's supposed to pay me back.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.671
-She is so rich.
-Talk to Marco.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.839
I can't.

18:51.922 --> 18:56.009
He'll see it for himself in like two days.
It'll be better if you tell him first.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.053
Then Condé Nast can set legal onto her.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.721
No, she says a check is coming.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.639
Get a grip.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.183
She's been stringing you along
for three months.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.518
Tell him, or I will.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.853
She paid back some of it.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.730
If she pays back the rest,
then Marco doesn't ever have to know.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.232
Do you think this is grade school?

19:10.315 --> 19:11.900
This is fraud.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.861
It's police. It's jail time.

19:14.611 --> 19:17.239
This is serious, Rachel.
You have to turn her in.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.657
You don't know her!

19:19.908 --> 19:24.538
Look… To you
she's an inconvenient accounting holdup.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.291
To me, she's my friend.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.795
And I am not turning
a foreign woman over to the police.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.297
Not in Trump's America.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.966
Not when I actually know her.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.801
And know she's a good person.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.220
And know that whatever
she's going through,

19:40.304 --> 19:43.056
she is going to figure it out
and come out stronger for.

19:44.099 --> 19:44.933
Same as I will.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.410
Hey, what happened? What's going on?

20:03.493 --> 20:06.246
-Nothing is going on.
-Something's going on.

20:06.330 --> 20:10.209
What happened was,
I can see the baby's head is now engaged.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.044
Engaged? Oh, my God, okay.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.420
Engaged, engaged is what?

20:13.503 --> 20:15.923
That's not serious. That's not married.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.424
Vivian,

20:18.091 --> 20:20.969
two days, three tops, and you're in labor.

20:21.053 --> 20:25.349
I want only gentle walks,
low stress and relaxation from now on.

20:26.058 --> 20:26.934
You've got it.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.605
Vivian, you've got
to take care of yourself.

20:31.688 --> 20:32.606
I will.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.191
I promise.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.244
<i>Hello?</i>

20:46.411 --> 20:47.996
Uh, Anna?

20:48.956 --> 20:50.040
Anna, are you there?

20:50.749 --> 20:52.459
I'm here, Rachel. What's up?

20:53.669 --> 20:54.503
Uh…

20:55.128 --> 20:58.006
I don't know
if you got any of my messages,

20:58.090 --> 21:01.426
but I'm still waiting
on that wire transfer.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.472
You know what,
I'm so fed up with this wire thing.

21:05.555 --> 21:11.144
I'm at the W, why don't I go to the bank
and get a cashier's check for you?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.813
You can come and collect it.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.064
Does that work?

21:14.147 --> 21:16.400
It works. That works.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.818
I'll come in today.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.658
Yes! I knew it! Yes.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.291
In her article,
Rachel talks about an intervention.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.501
Mmm-hmm.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.169
No one mentioned that to me.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.921
Not Anna, not Kacy.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.425
All right,
car will be here in four minutes.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.847
First babies are always late.
Everybody always says that.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.100
Your sister. Her baby was late, right?

21:50.851 --> 21:52.019
Rue was a week early.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.316
-What are you doing?
-Calling an Uber.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.359
Are you serious?

22:00.485 --> 22:01.862
Jack, my story isn't done.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.741
I'm close. I just…

22:07.034 --> 22:09.536
-I need to talk to Kacy.
-Did you hear Dr. Harris?

22:09.619 --> 22:12.706
Rest. Relaxation. Gentle walks.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.583
Vivian, this is not a drill.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.127
We're at zero dark baby.
And we're not even ready.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.214
The nursery's not done,
we haven't child-proofed the house.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.426
We need that baby monitor with the things.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.761
We have no diapers.

22:25.844 --> 22:29.348
Look, people have babies every day.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.266
People squat in fields.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.769
We are not special.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.438
So, we don't have this stuff.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.647
This is where we are.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.901
We're not bad parents
because she's not here yet to parent.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.319
So you know what we do?

22:42.402 --> 22:45.864
Whatever it takes to be ready
when she gets here.

22:45.947 --> 22:49.493
I need to get this story
out of my head and onto the page.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.037
I need to get this done. I need to finish.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.165
I need to have this baby,
knowing that I kicked ass.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.291
And won.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.752
Can you get behind that?

23:03.715 --> 23:06.051
Can you do it in two days?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.097
I have to. It's now or never.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.615
What the hell?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.412
Can I help you?

23:36.164 --> 23:38.583
I'm looking for my friend. Anna Delvey.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.168
She's not with us anymore.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.379
Look, I need to see her.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.923
She left a check for me,
I have to get it from her room.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.258
She left a check for you?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.095
What do you mean
she's not with you anymore?

23:50.178 --> 23:52.472
She hasn't… She hasn't paid you?

23:52.556 --> 23:55.851
I'm unable to discuss
the personal affairs of any of our guests.

23:55.934 --> 23:59.646
Or any ongoing financial disputes,
or irregularities they may have with us.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.233
Or the Beekman. Or the Mercer.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.990
Okay.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.120
God.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.166
So what am I supposed to do?

24:20.459 --> 24:22.794
You don't understand,
I'm just a normal person.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.172
She's rich.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.506
Really rich.

24:26.590 --> 24:27.716
Rich?

24:28.633 --> 24:30.093
It doesn't seem that way.

24:32.345 --> 24:37.434
While Rachel's losing her mind waiting
for Anna to pay her back, Anna is where?

24:37.517 --> 24:38.727
By that point she's in jail.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.104
The W Hotel
called the cops on her for non-payment.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.189
That's right.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.691
Here's the arrest paperwork
and booking log.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.278
That's when she first met Todd.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.656
I got you out on bail but this isn't over.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.284
I mean, what is happening in America?

24:54.367 --> 24:56.369
I had high hopes for your new president.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.497
This would never happen to me in Europe.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.124
Especially not in Germany
or Paris where I'm better known.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.002
Sorry if I missed this,
but why didn't you pay?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.253
I mean, I tried to,

25:05.337 --> 25:08.757
but I guess I didn't warn
my bank that I was traveling, so…

25:08.840 --> 25:10.467
Cards weren't working. Got it.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.303
They put me in handcuffs and everything.

25:13.386 --> 25:14.262
Can you imagine?

25:15.430 --> 25:16.515
Yeah. They do that.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.435
I mean, they should be
more considerate of someone's stature.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.270
When you represented Alec Baldwin,

25:22.354 --> 25:27.275
I'm sure they didn't put him in shackles
if he went after a paparazzi or whatever.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.528
I didn't represent Alec Baldwin.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.782
-But, it said online when you--
-Mr. Baldwin had a stalker.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.034
I represented her.

25:36.701 --> 25:37.661
The stalker?

25:37.744 --> 25:38.620
So…

25:39.538 --> 25:42.374
what happens now
is that you sign this form

25:42.457 --> 25:44.751
that allows me
to put a lien on your assets

25:44.834 --> 25:47.921
in case of some other mishap
with your finances down the line.

25:48.004 --> 25:51.132
And I get to work on making
this go from a criminal matter

25:51.216 --> 25:54.594
back to the misunderstanding
that I'm sure it was.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.475
One other thing.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.062
Because of all this bank trouble,

26:04.145 --> 26:06.773
I'm still having
a hard time with my credit cards,

26:06.856 --> 26:08.942
so, I'll just need to stay with you.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.610
It'll only be for a few nights.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.820
Absolutely not.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.451
How are you doing with this?

26:18.535 --> 26:20.704
This story makes her look so bad.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.497
We didn't even know half this stuff.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
Did you read
this part about the intervention?

26:24.666 --> 26:26.960
I know. You talk to Anna?

26:27.043 --> 26:29.212
<i>Not yet. This case is going to kill me.</i>

26:35.302 --> 26:37.887
You didn't tell me
anything about an intervention.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.557
<i>Rachel was a mess.</i>

26:40.640 --> 26:42.642
This girl had left her
hanging for so long,

26:42.726 --> 26:44.477
then this story about her being busted--

26:44.561 --> 26:46.896
Back up,
who decided that you should confront her?

26:46.980 --> 26:47.814
Me, I guess.

26:49.899 --> 26:53.778
I'm all live and let live, but…
I thought, let's fix this.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.615
Get Anna to admit what's wrong,

26:56.698 --> 26:58.491
get Rachel her money, help Anna.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.452
Maybe call her parents if she needed.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.040
I told Anna
to come meet me for drinks.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.375
I said my friend Nicole

27:07.459 --> 27:09.961
was in the neighborhood
and would bring her.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.047
Nicole? Your client got involved?

27:14.799 --> 27:16.217
That was a mistake.

27:16.301 --> 27:19.095
She was here
when Rachel showed up in tears.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.558
Tighten that core, navel to spine.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.851
It hurts.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.395
Shit.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.861
She wants us to have the kids over.

27:35.904 --> 27:40.492
Why the fuck should I have
those vampires ruin our holiday weekend?

27:42.118 --> 27:44.579
-Nicole, deep breath.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.499
Remember what I said
about staying present.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.710
The past is your teacher,
but the present is your creation.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.381
What did she do?

27:58.051 --> 27:59.552
Look at me.

28:00.553 --> 28:03.640
You have let Anna take too much,
it is time to stand in your power.

28:03.723 --> 28:04.808
I don't have any power.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.560
That is not true.
You have to claim your power back.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.397
You have to take up space
and demand what you need.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.858
It's time for you
to love yourself and put yourself first.

28:15.944 --> 28:16.945
Do you think she'll come?

28:17.028 --> 28:19.197
Nicole is picking her up right now.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.158
-I'm scared.
-No.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.160
You are brave.

28:24.244 --> 28:25.870
And you're going to face her.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.831
And how are you
going to flip the narrative?

28:27.914 --> 28:29.541
By standing in my power.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.418
-Good.
-Because I am a bad bitch.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.836
Yes, you are!

28:32.919 --> 28:34.045
Now let's do this.

28:34.671 --> 28:35.630
Yeah.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.133
-I'm a bad bitch.
-I'm a bad bitch.

28:38.216 --> 28:40.009
-Bad bitch. Bad…
-Bad bitch.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.344
Kacy wants to meet here?

28:41.428 --> 28:42.512
She's waiting for us.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.765
Oh, my God, Kacy.

28:45.849 --> 28:49.144
What are we doing on this side of town?
Everyone's so old.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.396
Rachel.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.525
What the fuck is this?

28:57.235 --> 28:58.236
An intervention?

29:09.581 --> 29:12.375
I have a business to run
and you're wasting my time.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.628
You paid me that 5,000, and I am grateful

29:15.712 --> 29:17.672
but please, okay, I need the rest.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.466
Just transfer it.

29:19.549 --> 29:22.552
The head of finance is back
and I can't let him find out.

29:22.635 --> 29:25.430
Tell us the truth about Marrakesh.
Where is Rachel's money?

29:26.347 --> 29:28.057
I told you. I'll pay you back.

29:28.141 --> 29:31.102
It's been three months,
Anna, three months.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.562
I know you're my friend

29:32.645 --> 29:36.316
and you don't want to hurt me so please,
just give me back that money.

29:36.399 --> 29:37.275
Please, Anna.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.694
Why are you being like this? So dramatic.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.030
I'm being dramatic?

29:42.113 --> 29:45.617
You always pretend to promote peace,
but really you just love a riot.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.120
-You crave drama.
-You've left her in a horrible situation.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.706
She's about to lose her apartment.
She could lose her job.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.041
Talk to us, Anna.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.377
What's happening?
What's going on with your trust fund?

29:56.461 --> 29:58.505
Do you need us
to call someone, your parents?

29:58.588 --> 29:59.839
Who do you think you are?

29:59.923 --> 30:02.133
You owe Rachel $57,000.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.512
If you're not honest with us,
we can't help.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.681
Do you really believe
all this bullshit affirmation?

30:08.765 --> 30:11.935
What are you crying for?
I told you this would be sorted.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.353
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:15.396 --> 30:17.065
Who the fuck are you?

30:17.732 --> 30:19.400
Calm down, Nicole. It's okay.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.027
-No, it isn't.
-God.

30:21.110 --> 30:23.738
Look at your friend,
crying like a rag doll.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.615
She's a pathetic mess because of you.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.076
This is none of your business.
You don't know me.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.828
I know a million girls just like you.

30:29.911 --> 30:30.870
Unlikely.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.957
This is all so stupid and short-sighted.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.751
You're all so basic.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.128
You don't know
what it's like to create something.

30:39.212 --> 30:42.340
Ugh! Please! You're a liar.

30:42.423 --> 30:43.591
Everyone can see that.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.218
Just give her the money you owe her.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.220
Enough, Nicole. Anna…

30:47.303 --> 30:49.055
Just stop, Anna.

30:49.138 --> 30:51.724
Okay, stop. Just tell us the truth.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.395
I'm creating something
that's going to be iconic.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.480
But you're bothering me
about credit card bills?

30:57.564 --> 31:01.067
Do you know
how many things I have on my mind?

31:01.150 --> 31:05.071
I've got lawyers and financiers
who are helping me create ADF.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.866
I'm leasing
a whole fucking building on Park Avenue.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.285
-Bullshit.
-What do you know?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.745
She's right. It's bullshit.
You're not leasing 281 Park.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.831
You can't talk to me like that, Kacy.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.375
You're fired.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.627
Girl, I already fired you.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.338
You aren't leasing 281 Park
because it's already been leased.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.507
-That's not true.
-Actually, it is.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.384
Says so right there.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.070
That's fake news.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.656
-Are you for real?
-No, this is my building.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.366
-Anna, what's going on?
-Anna…

31:51.367 --> 31:52.619
Fuck you, Kacy!

31:52.702 --> 31:55.204
Screw you and your psychobabble bullshit!

31:55.288 --> 31:58.082
You have no clue what it's like for me.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.334
I'm a boss.

31:59.417 --> 32:03.463
I'm trying to build a foundation
and I'm surrounded by a bunch of amateurs!

32:03.546 --> 32:06.299
Please, Anna. I am begging you.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.343
No! I'm doing everything I can.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.095
Do you think
I have time to waste with this?

32:11.179 --> 32:14.349
Your money is coming.
Why can't you just listen?

32:18.561 --> 32:20.104
I thought you were my friend.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.066
But this is how you treat me?

32:23.691 --> 32:26.027
After everything I've done for you?

32:26.110 --> 32:29.447
Anna, you need to stop.
Tell us the truth and we can try to help.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.574
Please, Anna.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.619
I need that money.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.788
This has gone too far.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.380
I'm going to the bathroom.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.719
That bitch is crazy.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.263
I should've known
this was never going to work.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.725
Give it time,
I think we're getting through to her,

32:57.809 --> 32:59.686
-she's starting to listen.
-You think so?

32:59.769 --> 33:00.853
Yes.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.522
-She's running.
-What?

33:02.605 --> 33:03.648
Anna!

33:13.908 --> 33:15.451
<i>Whole thing was a disaster.</i>

33:16.119 --> 33:18.079
I told Rachel
we should contact Anna's parents.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.456
We could find them online or something.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.125
So you spoke to Anna's parents?

33:22.208 --> 33:25.044
No. Rachel said
she wanted to think about it.

33:27.922 --> 33:30.591
And then, I see her article today.

33:31.634 --> 33:35.096
These girls are toxic. All of them.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.516
I want out of this narrative.

33:38.599 --> 33:41.477
-What do you mean?
-I don't want to be in your article.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.021
-What?
-This ain't me.

33:43.104 --> 33:46.107
I don't want my clients
seeing me in this negative context.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.608
I'm out.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.029
Kacy, I need your story.

33:51.112 --> 33:55.366
I am done with Anna Delvey and her chaos.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.661
Please just take a beat.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.039
Think about it. Don't decide now.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.425
They're trying to jump ship.

34:13.634 --> 34:14.469
Who now?

34:14.552 --> 34:17.305
Ron from Blade says
take out the stealing the plane thing.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.141
-He wants his name out of it.
-No. Absolutely not.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.018
It's already in the public record.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.604
She was charged
with stealing the plane. No.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.106
We'll see what legal says.

34:27.190 --> 34:32.153
Oh, Jesus, people are so spooked
by Rachel's article.

34:32.236 --> 34:35.198
You've been sitting here for hours
and you should be home.

34:35.865 --> 34:36.866
Need to finish.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.620
Is this bitch for real?
What are you going to do about this?

34:40.703 --> 34:42.663
She's making it sound
like she's the victim.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.832
I'm going to write my article.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.044
That's what I'm doing.
The facts speak for themselves.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.547
What's with the towel?

34:51.631 --> 34:53.508
In case my water breaks.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.595
I mean, you think Anna's seen this?

35:05.228 --> 35:07.146
You should have told us you were famous.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.147
What?

35:14.153 --> 35:15.780
That fucking bitch!

35:15.863 --> 35:19.075
No! No! Let me out of here!

35:19.158 --> 35:20.660
Let me out!

35:20.743 --> 35:24.122
I need to call Vivian Kent.
I need to make a call!

35:24.205 --> 35:25.248
Fuck!

35:25.331 --> 35:26.749
No! Let me out!

35:31.838 --> 35:34.549
Fuck you, Rachel!

35:46.561 --> 35:47.478
Oh.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.148
Next.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.315
Oh, um…

35:51.816 --> 35:57.029
Hi, I want to report a crime, I guess.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.699
A crime? You guess? Okay.

35:59.782 --> 36:03.119
-You're the victim of this crime?
-Yes. I'm the victim.

36:03.202 --> 36:04.412
Nature of the crime?

36:05.079 --> 36:08.166
I was on holiday
in Marrakesh at La Mamounia,

36:08.249 --> 36:10.293
it's a luxury 5-star resort in Morocco.

36:10.376 --> 36:11.794
The Kardashians stayed there.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.297
Anyway, my friend asked to borrow my card

36:14.380 --> 36:16.883
to pay for some stuff,
and basically ran up some money…

36:16.966 --> 36:18.801
a lot of money on my AmEx.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.887
Actually, it's my work AmEx.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.471
But she promised to pay me back,

36:22.555 --> 36:26.142
but it's been months, almost three months,
and I'm going out of my mind.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.102
Just a moment.

36:29.604 --> 36:35.693
So you went on a 62k vacay
with your pal at Le Moumounia?

36:35.776 --> 36:37.486
No, La Momounia.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.781
Right. And you paid for this
on your work credit card?

36:40.865 --> 36:43.701
It was both on my personal
and my work card.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.453
But it was only supposed to be a hold.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.414
-Not the actual charge.
-Right. Got it.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.417
Uh, and your friend, Anna Delvey,

36:51.500 --> 36:54.587
did she coerce you
into giving her the card?

36:56.589 --> 36:58.758
No. Uh, not exactly.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.093
I mean,
I thought she was good for the money.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.390
62k on the company card.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.143
How much is your limit, Jo?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.062
-On my company card?
-Hmm.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.022
The city doesn't give me a company card.

37:13.105 --> 37:16.943
Yeah. They don't even give me
expenses to replace my gun holster.

37:17.026 --> 37:20.029
Look, I'm… I'm really in trouble here.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.448
Can't you talk to her? Like, I need help.

37:22.531 --> 37:24.951
Miss, right now I have one homicide,

37:25.034 --> 37:28.204
a sex assault,
two incidents of domestic violence,

37:28.287 --> 37:31.123
and a flasher at large in Alphabet City.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.250
Look, I'm sorry…

37:34.210 --> 37:35.628
but I don't know what to do.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.922
What should I do?

37:38.005 --> 37:40.633
Well, there's no crime here
from what I can see.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.801
My advice?

37:42.593 --> 37:45.846
Start a GoFundMe page
and maybe pick better friends.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.014
For sure.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.182
Better friends.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.059
Next.

37:53.354 --> 37:58.234
Anna runs away from the intervention
and Rachel goes to the Chinatown precinct.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.069
-Without telling Kacy.
-Snitch.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.571
So, where's Anna? Where did she go?

38:02.655 --> 38:05.992
And where's Rachel after the cops
laugh her out of the precinct?

38:06.075 --> 38:09.787
I… I swear, I wasn't trying
to defraud the company.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.497
She said she would pay me back.

38:11.580 --> 38:14.083
This isn't about your friend,
but your lack of judgment.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.085
-But it wasn't my fault.
-Whose then?

38:16.168 --> 38:18.296
-I tried to fix it.
-You failed.

38:23.217 --> 38:24.135
Are you firing me?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.889
If an investigation
finds that you were in on it,

38:28.973 --> 38:30.308
we'll be calling in the police.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.853
Wait, I… I didn't take any of it.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.813
You stayed at the hotel, didn't you?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.649
Can't you understand
what I've gone through?

38:38.733 --> 38:41.444
You helped
your friend defraud this company.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.071
You're neck deep in this Rachel.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.764
Tell Alan to call me back. It's urgent.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.483
Gabriel, it's me.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.653
They leased 281 Park.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.324
How could you let this happen to me?

39:30.743 --> 39:31.744
Call me back.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.622
You need to fix this.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.832
We need to talk. Next plan.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.278
Good evening, madam, can I help you?

40:07.279 --> 40:09.115
No, I was on my way to the desk attendant.

40:09.198 --> 40:12.868
I'm afraid the desk attendant
won't be able to attend to you, madam.

40:13.994 --> 40:16.414
Why not? There's no line.
She's just sitting there.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.290
Because if you get any closer to her,

40:18.374 --> 40:20.626
she's been instructed
to call for security.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.920
Personally, I'd rather
avoid that whole fuss,

40:23.003 --> 40:26.215
which is why
I was so eager to attend to you myself.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.343
Now, is there anything else?

40:30.845 --> 40:33.389
You're kicking me out?
Do you know who I am?

40:33.472 --> 40:34.640
Yes, I do.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.100
I have a photo of you,

40:36.183 --> 40:40.563
which is why I'm advising you
to seek accommodation elsewhere.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.280
It's cold out there.

40:49.363 --> 40:52.533
And in here, rooms start at 800.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.494
For you, payment upfront.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.305
You and Anna were friends, right?

41:14.388 --> 41:17.475
-Still are.
-So, what was her deal?

41:17.558 --> 41:19.018
Like, what is this all about?

41:19.101 --> 41:21.395
If she's that rich,
why didn't she just pay?

41:23.063 --> 41:24.648
Anna's a good person.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.859
Kind of kooky, but real.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.111
You know, if she's your friend,
she has your back.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.363
But her dad cut her off.
It happens all the time.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.532
These rich kids, their big allowances,

41:33.616 --> 41:37.328
sometimes shit goes down
in the bank of mom and dad.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.997
But when it works itself out,
that money is back.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.917
Anna just… They had a bad few weeks.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.921
I'm out.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.738
Sounds intense.

43:35.821 --> 43:38.073
Yeah. I knew it wouldn't work.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.491
Confronting her like that.

43:39.575 --> 43:40.868
She called me dramatic.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.662
-She said I pretend to want peace.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.331
Like, she turned it all on me.

43:45.414 --> 43:48.417
-She's awful.
-The cops think I'm a fool.

43:48.500 --> 43:52.504
My coworkers think I'm an idiot,
and I feel like an idiot.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.548
Like, how did I let this happen to me?

43:54.632 --> 43:55.674
What was…

43:57.926 --> 43:59.803
You were there, is this my fault?

44:03.015 --> 44:06.060
You're a good person.
And you were being a good friend.

44:06.143 --> 44:07.269
And I got screwed.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.230
You were right.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.816
This wouldn't happen to Anna.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.986
She'd put herself first.
She would be selfish.

44:17.988 --> 44:19.239
What are you going to do?

44:19.323 --> 44:22.284
To my face, while I was crying,
she said I craved drama.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.828
Like our friendship meant nothing.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.331
Like what she's putting me through
meant nothing.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.048
If she wants drama, she's going to get it.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.688
How long's she been at it?

44:51.271 --> 44:53.732
-Twelve hours.
-Respect.

44:55.442 --> 44:56.944
I mean, she's crazy.

44:57.027 --> 44:59.655
She is not crazy. She has her reasons.

44:59.738 --> 45:03.117
So she made one mistake in her career.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.244
Women don't get to make mistakes?

45:06.578 --> 45:08.080
It was a big fuck-up.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.000
Barry?

45:12.084 --> 45:15.170
Maud, she should have been on top of it.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.880
Because you would have been?

45:16.964 --> 45:18.382
She's a human.

45:18.465 --> 45:22.636
It was a goddamn list
and the kid lied to her.

45:23.637 --> 45:25.806
Tell me
you haven't fucked up at some point.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.892
I bet you didn't lose jobs
and respect over it.

45:32.938 --> 45:35.357
Rachel, until
this investigation is complete,

45:35.441 --> 45:38.569
I'll need you to return
all your company IDs and credit cards.

45:38.652 --> 45:39.653
It wasn't my fault.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.947
The investigation
will determine all the facts.

45:42.531 --> 45:45.743
Until then you must not discuss
this with other members of staff.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.537
And you will be suspended,
pending a thorough inquiry.

45:49.705 --> 45:50.914
I can't lose my job.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.416
You should have thought about that

45:52.499 --> 45:55.127
before you gave
your company credit card to a friend.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.132
In the State of New York,
I'm entitled to a lawyer in compliance

46:00.215 --> 46:03.135
with the National Labor Relations Act
in any disciplinary inquiry.

46:03.218 --> 46:04.762
Also, you failed to inform me

46:04.845 --> 46:06.930
that I could have
an independent representative.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.515
-That might be--
-It's the law.

46:17.983 --> 46:19.151
What was that in there?

46:19.234 --> 46:21.028
I'm standing up for myself.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.748
How's the rest going?

46:32.831 --> 46:35.250
Seven thousand words,
five thousand good ones.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.210
And the other thing?

46:37.628 --> 46:38.504
Still dry.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.466
<i>This was Manhattan in the 21st century.</i>

46:44.802 --> 46:47.221
<i>And money is more powerful than ever.</i>

46:51.391 --> 46:54.561
<i>Rare is the city dweller who,</i>
<i>when presented with an opportunity</i>

46:54.645 --> 46:58.816
<i>for a sudden and unexpected</i>
<i>influx of cash, doesn't grasp for it.</i>

47:02.486 --> 47:06.365
<i>Of course, this money</i>
<i>almost always comes with strings attached.</i>

47:08.534 --> 47:10.536
<i>Still, everyone makes the reach</i>

47:10.619 --> 47:14.331
<i>because here, money is the one thing</i>
<i>no one can ever have enough of.</i>

47:17.626 --> 47:20.754
<i>Resilience is hard to come by,</i>
<i>but not capital.</i>

47:20.838 --> 47:22.339
<i>Maybe it could have happened.</i>

47:22.422 --> 47:25.300
<i>In this city,</i>
<i>where enormous amounts of invisible money</i>

47:25.384 --> 47:27.094
<i>trade hands every day…</i>

47:27.177 --> 47:28.971
<i>Why not? Why this girl?</i>

47:29.054 --> 47:31.139
<i>She wasn't super hot, they pointed out.</i>

47:31.223 --> 47:32.349
<i>Or super charming.</i>

47:32.432 --> 47:33.809
<i>She wasn't even very nice.</i>

47:33.892 --> 47:35.769
<i>How did she manage to convince</i>

47:35.853 --> 47:38.230
<i>an enormous amount of cool,</i>
<i>successful people?</i>

47:38.313 --> 47:40.732
<i>Anna looked at the soul</i>
<i>of New York and recognized</i>

47:40.816 --> 47:43.610
<i>that if you distract people</i>
<i>with shiny objects,</i>

47:43.694 --> 47:44.611
<i>show them money,</i>

47:44.695 --> 47:47.239
<i>they'll be virtually</i>
<i>unable to see anything else.</i>

47:47.322 --> 47:50.200
<i>And the thing was, it was so easy.</i>

47:53.078 --> 47:54.288
It's good.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.498
I don't disagree.

47:57.332 --> 48:00.544
But we still have a Kacy problem.
Legal says we need her.

48:03.171 --> 48:04.172
I'll call her.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.551
Oh, God.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.511
No, no, no.

48:09.595 --> 48:13.765
-Uh…
-No, no, no. No. No, no.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.261
-Yes.
-It's me. You good?

48:51.345 --> 48:52.262
Sure.

48:52.346 --> 48:55.599
I'm heading to the court house now.
See you by 10:00 a.m.?

48:55.682 --> 48:56.725
I'm leaving now.

48:56.808 --> 48:58.518
Anna, be on time.

48:58.602 --> 49:00.771
The judge
does not take kindly to lateness.

49:00.854 --> 49:03.148
I said I'm leaving now. Bye.

49:25.921 --> 49:28.340
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Kacy, I need an answer.

49:31.677 --> 49:33.095
This is all bad karma.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.138
Kacy, I don't have time any more.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.431
Let me tell your truth.

49:36.515 --> 49:37.933
I don't want my name in it.

49:39.184 --> 49:42.062
Okay. I'll use your quotes,
but your name is out.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.442
Nothing that identifies me.

49:47.526 --> 49:48.610
You have my word.

49:48.694 --> 49:51.363
You'll be described as the, uh, trainer.

49:56.451 --> 49:57.411
The trainer.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.044
Okay.

50:07.462 --> 50:08.338
Thank you.

50:11.550 --> 50:12.718
She's in.

50:12.801 --> 50:15.429
Unnamed. But in.

50:15.512 --> 50:17.723
God. Somebody get an elevator for them.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.421
Mr. Spodek.

50:55.260 --> 50:58.180
-How are we doing?
-What?

50:59.306 --> 51:02.392
Did she just ask how are we doing?

51:03.185 --> 51:04.561
-Fuck you.
-Vivi.

51:04.644 --> 51:07.272
-We are not having a baby.

51:07.939 --> 51:10.567
She's got a point. We're not.

51:10.650 --> 51:13.737
But if you can still tell me
to fuck off, you're good.

51:14.654 --> 51:18.700
-See, we're good.
-No, we're not. We are not good.

51:19.659 --> 51:23.080
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Something must have happened to delay her.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.164
She's a sweet kid--

51:24.247 --> 51:27.084
A sweet kid with a penchant
for not paying for things.

51:27.918 --> 51:30.087
I'm issuing
a bench warrant for your client.

51:30.170 --> 51:31.254
This case is adjourned.

51:34.299 --> 51:36.885
Where the hell are you?

51:39.721 --> 51:41.473
-Deposit?
-Yes, please.

51:41.556 --> 51:42.682


51:59.366 --> 52:01.451
I would like to make a withdrawal.

52:04.121 --> 52:04.996
In cash?

52:05.664 --> 52:06.748
Yes.

52:11.419 --> 52:13.004
Would you like that in 50s?

52:14.714 --> 52:15.841
Throw in some 20s too.

52:28.645 --> 52:30.272
We're at ten centimeters.

52:30.355 --> 52:31.982
Pressure's a little low on mom.

52:32.065 --> 52:33.567
Baby's a tad tachycardic.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.028
And now we're getting late decels here.

52:41.199 --> 52:44.953
Vivian,
let's get this baby out now.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.122
-Now?
-Right now.

52:47.205 --> 52:49.875
I'm really tired. Maybe later.

52:49.958 --> 52:51.585
Vivian, now!

52:51.668 --> 52:52.627
Jack.

52:52.711 --> 52:56.298
The second she has a contraction,
get her to push.

52:56.381 --> 52:57.382
Okay.

52:57.465 --> 52:58.592
Chair please.

53:00.093 --> 53:02.137
Ow!

53:02.220 --> 53:05.432
Yeah, push. Push, push, push, push,
push, push, push, push, push.

53:06.308 --> 53:11.271
Push, push, push, push. Push, push, push.
Push, push. Push, push, push.

53:11.354 --> 53:12.606
Tired.

53:14.107 --> 53:17.194
-Make it stop.
-No stopping.

53:17.277 --> 53:18.904
You got this. You got this.

53:18.987 --> 53:21.072
No, I'm done.

53:22.365 --> 53:25.327
-I'm not having a baby today.
-Dr. Harris.

53:25.410 --> 53:27.120
-I see it.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.372
Jack, she has to do this
or we go to the OR.

53:29.456 --> 53:32.167
Do you understand? Make her push.

53:32.876 --> 53:33.710
Hey.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.338
Listen to me. Listen to me.

53:37.797 --> 53:38.632
You're losing.

53:40.675 --> 53:43.678
-I mean, you're losing right now.
-Are you… Hey.

53:43.762 --> 53:46.181
You're losing right now,
and you don't lose.

53:46.264 --> 53:47.974
You win. Right?

53:48.934 --> 53:50.185
You can do this.

53:50.268 --> 53:53.104
Right. This is easy. You can do this.

53:53.188 --> 53:55.982
Anyone can do this. Tell me why, Vivi.

53:56.650 --> 53:57.734
Vivi, tell me why.

53:59.778 --> 54:05.033
-Because people squat in fields.
-That's right. People squat in fields.

54:05.116 --> 54:06.660
I'm not special.

54:06.743 --> 54:08.411
You are not special. Come on.

54:09.621 --> 54:11.581
I need to do the work.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.501
Do the work. Do the work.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.838
I just need you to push.
One last time for me.

54:20.548 --> 54:22.550
-I am not special.
-You are not special.

54:22.634 --> 54:24.803
-I am not special.
-You are not special.

54:24.886 --> 54:30.267
I am not special!

54:30.350 --> 54:32.852
Push, push, push, Vivian,
push, push, push.

54:32.936 --> 54:36.106
-Push, Vivian. Push, Vivian.

54:58.169 --> 54:59.170
Wow.

54:59.838 --> 55:00.714
Mmm-hmm.

55:16.229 --> 55:18.189
Stand in your power, Rachel Williams.

55:36.750 --> 55:38.877
Ms. Williams, thank you for waiting.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.919
How can I help?

55:42.172 --> 55:44.466
I want to tell you about my friend, Anna.

55:45.925 --> 55:47.302
I think she's a con woman.

55:53.350 --> 55:55.643
I love Los Angeles in fall.

55:55.727 --> 55:57.687
Beats this dump.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.024
This city's full
of pickpockets and thieves.
