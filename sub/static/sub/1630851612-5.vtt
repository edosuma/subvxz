Welcome to "alter ego."
I'm your host rocsi diaz.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.333
Let's meet our amazing
panel of judges.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.902
Please show a lot of love
to musician, producer,

01:43.938 --> 01:46.939
and tech entrepreneur
will.I.Am.

01:48.275 --> 01:52.778
Singer, songwriter,
and artist alanis morissette.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.950
Producer, singer,
and innovator grimes.

02:00.721 --> 02:04.690
And actor, singer,
and host nick lachey.

02:06.894 --> 02:10.496
Four of the alter egos
who survived the audition round

02:10.531 --> 02:12.698
are here to take
each other on

02:12.700 --> 02:14.900
in the series
of head-to-head performances.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.668
It will be up
to our panel of judges

02:16.704 --> 02:19.972
to vote on who stays
and who goes.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.375
And the best part of this
is that the judges don't know

02:23.377 --> 02:27.179
anything about the contestants'
real identities.

02:27.214 --> 02:29.414
But, while the judges
may be in the dark,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.650
everyone at home
will be able to get
the meet the people

02:31.719 --> 02:37.089
who are behind them
vying to become the next
generation's superstar.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.859
Judges, now that you guys
have gotten over

02:40.861 --> 02:43.629
the initial shock and awe
of seeing them perform,

02:43.664 --> 02:46.131
how are you going to decide
which alter ego

02:46.200 --> 02:49.201
in each head-to-head
deserves to move on

02:49.236 --> 02:50.736
and which goes home?

02:50.804 --> 02:52.871
For me, it's about
the whole picture--

02:52.907 --> 02:55.440
vocal performance,
that charisma,

02:55.476 --> 02:58.377
that intangible thing
that just kind of compels us.

02:58.445 --> 03:02.748
And we're looking
for that emotional connection
to the performance.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.653
It's time to introduce
the two alter egos

03:07.655 --> 03:10.189
competing
in our first head-to-head.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.329
Neveah king vs. Safara
is gonna be intense.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.897
I have all the confidence
in the world right now, girl.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.067
- I'm never going back. Mm-mm.
- I love that!

03:22.102 --> 03:26.305
They both have amazing talent
and super fun personalities.

03:26.340 --> 03:30.175
- Hi, nick!
- Oh, whoa.

03:30.211 --> 03:33.345
As judges, we have
absolutely no idea

03:33.347 --> 03:35.914
the human behind the alter ego.
We never see them.

03:35.950 --> 03:39.785
So, it'll be interesting
to see how they embody
their alter egos.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.820
It's not just
about the performances.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.822
We are looking
for the whole package.

03:43.824 --> 03:49.595
Rocsi:
Please welcome to the stage
neveah king and safara.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.696
Whoa!

03:58.339 --> 04:00.005
Will.I.Am:
Hi, safara. Hi, neveah king.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.773
- Hi.
- What's up, ladies?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.942
Hi, nick.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.911
How are you guys feeling
since your auditions?

04:05.946 --> 04:08.480
- I'm feeling confident.
- I'm feeling great.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.482
I'm feeling energized,
ready to go.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.784
Oh, that's right.
Y'all wasn't here, though.
Y'all missed it.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.320
Safara,
you had the hand thing.

04:15.389 --> 04:18.657
- Like, you was like...
- You remembered.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.559
And I was crushing
on neveah king,

04:20.628 --> 04:23.462
but then she revealed
that she had a crush on nick,

04:23.497 --> 04:24.896
so I was, like, squashed.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.933
But I put neveah king through.
Nick didn't.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.502
But I still got love
for neveah king.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.772
Thank you, will.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.942
Hey, neveah king,
I'm noticing that you changed
your hair color.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.576
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.245
I'm blue tonight.
It's nice.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.180
I'm blue tonight, too,
just for you.

04:42.216 --> 04:46.451
Hey, I see, babe.
I see you, babe.

Do both of you think
you have what it takes

04:48.355 --> 04:49.955
to be the next
digital superstar?

04:49.990 --> 04:54.493
Yes, I 100% believe
we both have what it takes.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.195
I would say we both bring
something really different,

04:57.231 --> 04:59.865
but there's definitely
room for a diva.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.168
Now, which one of us?
I'm not sure.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.971

to both of you guys.

- That's where I'm from.
- Ooh!

11:28.188 --> 11:32.757
I felt like I was able to just,
like, be myself as safara.

11:32.793 --> 11:37.429
( vocalizing )

11:40.967 --> 11:42.701
thank you.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.437
It really just felt
very emotional.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.105
When I did my audition song,

11:47.174 --> 11:50.275
I definitely felt my mom's
spirit with me.

11:50.310 --> 11:54.713
<i> When my mom passed away,</i>
<i> I was only 11 at the time.</i>

11:54.715 --> 11:57.682
<i> I think my mom</i>
<i> would love safara</i>

11:57.718 --> 12:02.954
because my mom was very spunky
and very fiery,

12:02.989 --> 12:05.857
and she was the life
of the party.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.926
<i> I think she would have</i>
<i> loved her, yeah.</i>

12:07.994 --> 12:10.628
<i> I think being the next</i>
<i> generation's superstar</i>

12:10.664 --> 12:13.798
<i> would 100% help me</i>
<i> achieve my goal</i>

12:13.867 --> 12:15.900
of letting other people
that feel like me

12:15.936 --> 12:18.436
know that they can be
whatever they want

12:18.472 --> 12:21.106
and it doesn't matter
what you look like.

12:21.108 --> 12:25.643
So that's what I would do
as the next superstar.

12:25.679 --> 12:29.280
<i>Next performance,</i>
<i>starting in three, two, one.</i>

12:29.316 --> 12:31.683
<i> Engage all systems.</i>
<i> Here we go.</i>

14:28.001 --> 14:30.702
Rocsi:
That's what I'm talking about.
You know what, safara?

14:30.737 --> 14:32.871
I want to know,
how did it feel for you
singing up here?

14:32.906 --> 14:34.239
I'm feeling great.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.074
I think that
first audition round

14:36.109 --> 14:38.076
really gave me the confidence

14:38.111 --> 14:41.145
to really blow it
out of the water this time.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.515
What do you think
of safara's performance?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.618
I really love
the juxtaposition--

14:46.686 --> 14:49.053
you have this kind of cutely
awkward personality.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.190
But then when you get onstage,
you feel really confident

14:52.192 --> 14:54.759
and like a serious pop star.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.028
Thank you. I love you.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.398
Nick, what do you think?

15:00.433 --> 15:04.068
You seem very, very,
very comfortable onstage
here tonight,

15:04.104 --> 15:09.340
- so, look, all in all,
what a great performance.
- Thank you.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.010
If you were to ask me who's
my favorite female artist...

15:12.078 --> 15:15.046
- Ahem.
- ...I'd say--

15:15.115 --> 15:18.383
- alanis morissette.
- Awkward.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.619
It's like beyoncé
or rihanna, right?

15:21.621 --> 15:23.788
And that song is, like,
so perfect the way it is.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.591
But I think you did things
to the song

15:26.626 --> 15:30.261
that I haven't
really heard be done,
and it was superb.

15:30.297 --> 15:35.400
- So, salute.
That's awesome.
- Thank you!

15:35.435 --> 15:39.637
- Alanis?
- It's so clear you can
bring it when it's on big.

15:39.673 --> 15:43.041
I would love to hear you--
just selfishly love to hear you

15:43.109 --> 15:44.642
in some smaller, subtler ways.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.578
Okay, I'll do that
for you, girl.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.580
So, after the break,
the judges will determine

15:49.616 --> 15:51.215
which one of them
will be moving on

15:51.318 --> 15:53.751
and which one we will
have to say good-bye to,

15:53.753 --> 15:58.056
but not before
the human behind them reveals
their true identity.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.357
You don't want to miss it.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.093
More "alter ego" on fox
after this.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.904
- You sounded lovely.
- ( speaking spanish )

16:18.745 --> 16:21.646
welcome back to "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.751
We're about to find out which
one of these awesome alter egos,

16:26.786 --> 16:28.653
neveah king or safara,

16:28.688 --> 16:31.756
is moving on to the semi-finals

16:31.791 --> 16:34.025
and which one is going home.

16:34.060 --> 16:38.096
The alter ego
who gets the most votes
will head to our diamond

16:38.131 --> 16:40.865
and will automatically advance
to the next round.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.533
It's time
for you guys to vote.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.640
- Nick?
- Two phenomenal voices.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.043
Two phenomenal performances.

16:52.078 --> 16:53.711
I'm trying
to tip the scale with

16:53.713 --> 16:56.214
what does next generation's
superstar mean?

16:56.282 --> 17:00.985
We talk sometimes
about the t-shirt,
the marketability,

17:01.021 --> 17:02.720
all those things
that play a part

17:02.789 --> 17:05.456
in what makes up a superstar.

17:05.492 --> 17:08.292
To me, the opportunity to be

17:08.328 --> 17:11.562
a next generation superstar

17:11.631 --> 17:12.764
feels greater...

17:14.667 --> 17:16.367
...For safara.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.537
- Thank you.
- Rocsi: Will?

17:19.572 --> 17:21.806
Safara, although
you sing amazing,

17:21.875 --> 17:25.810
the thing that is going to
make you that break-out artist

17:25.879 --> 17:29.013
is how you engage
with the audience.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.315
It's not just the singer
singing the song,

17:31.351 --> 17:34.819
it's that spiritual,
electric conversation.

17:34.821 --> 17:38.956
And I think you need to bring
that persona to life.

17:38.992 --> 17:43.261
Neveah king, you have
an extraordinary gift,

17:43.296 --> 17:45.863
you have that it factor.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.332
With that,
I want to see you through.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.071
Rocsi: Alanis?

17:53.106 --> 17:57.942
Neveah king, I love
how unified you seem
with your alter ego.

17:57.977 --> 18:02.380
And then, safara,
I would be excited to see
where you might evolve to

18:02.415 --> 18:05.049
in terms of just staying
hyper present when
you're singing

18:05.085 --> 18:06.884
and not, like,
rushing through the lower

18:06.953 --> 18:10.254
to get to that payoff
of climactic high note.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.423
And this was a really
difficult choice to make,

18:12.459 --> 18:15.059
but for me it's about
the whole picture,

18:15.095 --> 18:19.730
so I'm going to choose safara
to stay on that diamond.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.766
Thank you.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.502
All right, we have
two votes for safara,

18:24.504 --> 18:27.939
one vote for neveah king.

18:27.974 --> 18:31.943
Remember, if there is a tie,
it will go to the audience

18:31.978 --> 18:35.146
to decide who makes it
to the next round.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.447
This is really hard.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.216
Neveah, I loved
your performance.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.219
But I feel like
if you're gonna have a bit of,
like, a retro vibe,

18:41.254 --> 18:44.822
you probably want a bit
of something futuristic
in there, too.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.425
And so I guess for me,
I feel like safara

18:47.427 --> 18:49.727
might be a bit more
looking to the future.

18:49.796 --> 18:54.932
And so for this reason,
I'm gonna choose safara
to go to the diamond.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.703
Safara: Thank you.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.938
- Thank you.
- Good luck, darling.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.941
- Get it, baby.
- Go on up there, girl.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.344
Thank you!

19:07.780 --> 19:10.748
Safara, we'll see you
at the semi-finals.

19:13.286 --> 19:17.722
Unfortunately, neveah king,
this is the end

19:17.790 --> 19:20.525
of your time with us here
on "alter ego."

19:20.593 --> 19:23.427
but we'd love to have

19:23.463 --> 19:27.865
one more performance from you,

19:27.901 --> 19:30.701
and then we can finally reveal

19:30.737 --> 19:33.871
your true identity
to the judges.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.140
Is that okay
with you, queen?

19:36.176 --> 19:39.143
- Yes, ma'am, pam.
She's ready.
- Okay. Yes, ma'am, pam.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.712
She is ready.
Everyone, please give it up
one more time,

19:41.748 --> 19:44.749
massively talented,
neveah king.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.118
Yeah!

19:47.153 --> 19:49.020
I'm actually really curious
who she is.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.189
She's probably
a little older than my mom,

19:51.224 --> 19:52.857
- probably sang in church.
- Yeah.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.059
Like a 51-year-old woman.

Whoo!

21:26.719 --> 21:28.352
Rocsi: I am so thrilled

21:28.388 --> 21:30.388
for you guys to meet jay,

21:30.423 --> 21:33.324
aka neveah king.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.228
Damn!

21:37.263 --> 21:40.231
That was the most,
like, transformational--

21:40.233 --> 21:43.100
what the what?

21:43.169 --> 21:46.604
First of all,
I enjoyed our little romance
while it lasted.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.273
Okay.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.243
Neveah king was one of the--

21:52.278 --> 21:56.080
the more believable alter egos
in the entire show.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.516
I mean, not for one second
when you were performing

21:58.518 --> 22:00.685
did I step out of believing

22:00.720 --> 22:03.654
that she was exactly
who you portrayed her to be.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.424
And the only way
that's possible, my man,

22:06.426 --> 22:11.595
is because of your outstanding
and ridiculous vocal talent.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.198
Why did you think
you needed an alter ego?

22:14.233 --> 22:17.668
It was just really cool
to not be judged because
I'm a dude that sings high.

22:17.704 --> 22:22.073
I'm also a drag queen,
so I do get to twirl sometimes.

22:22.108 --> 22:25.142
You might see her.

22:25.178 --> 22:29.013
So, how will neveah king
inform your performances
moving forward?

22:29.082 --> 22:32.717
Well, I'm definitely gonna
embrace my inner goddess.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.186
I feel like there's definitely
a man on the outside,

22:35.188 --> 22:37.188
and I feel like there's
a woman on the inside,

22:37.190 --> 22:41.759
so I'm just gonna shine on
and be as bright as I possibly
can, you know?

22:42.895 --> 22:44.895
Thank you.
Thank you, guys!

22:44.964 --> 22:47.164
Jay, everybody.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.700
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.970
Coming up next,
phoenix embers and dipper scott

22:53.005 --> 22:55.406

right after this.

22:55.441 --> 22:56.607
You won't want to miss it.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.557
Welcome back.
This is "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

23:27.073 --> 23:31.375

and yanked them
out of my chest.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.568
This match-up
is going to be brutal.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.636
<i> All right, audience,</i>
<i> here we go.</i>

23:58.638 --> 24:00.104

24:14.787 --> 24:16.187

24:19.425 --> 24:20.491
But I'm just also curious,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.726
are you guys
alter ego friends?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.061
Like, do you guys hang out?

24:24.096 --> 24:25.696
We are friends, actually.

24:25.731 --> 24:27.264
We're actually kind of an
odd couple friends, you know?

24:27.266 --> 24:30.935
We're like the perfect
odd friends.

24:31.003 --> 24:35.639
She's very, uh,
high-energy, very social,

24:35.675 --> 24:38.142
and I'm obviously,
you know, quiet,

24:38.177 --> 24:39.543
and like the wallflower,
you know?

24:39.579 --> 24:41.745
She's like the ying
to your yang.

24:41.747 --> 24:43.080
- Something like that, yeah.
- All right.

24:43.115 --> 24:45.950
He gets sad sometimes,
so I try to cheer him up.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.219
- But not all the time.
- Oh, it's okay.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.321
Just sometimes.
Just most of the time.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.623
Just 92% of the time.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.758
I'm really excited
for your performance, dipper,

24:54.794 --> 24:57.428
'cause you have
this calm intenseness.

24:57.430 --> 25:02.299
If I ever get to meet dipper,
I'ma be crushed

25:02.301 --> 25:05.769
because I really truly believe
that dipper scott

25:05.838 --> 25:07.705
is dipper scott.

25:07.707 --> 25:11.075
And if I ever get a chance
to meet phoenix

25:11.110 --> 25:14.211
and your hair
ain't doing that?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.046
- I'm gonna be tripping.
- He's going to be really upset.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.215
Well, good luck to both of you.
Dipper, you're up first.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.417
And, phoenix,
we'll see you in a little bit.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.691
Jake: <i> When I first</i>
<i> stepped out on the stage</i>
<i> as my alter ego,</i>

25:27.760 --> 25:30.728
I was definitely nervous,
but it was kinda surreal.

25:30.796 --> 25:33.831
This alter ego actually can do
more than I can.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.134
- Were your tattoos moving?
- I believe so.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.104
- Aah!
- It's a lot of fun.

25:40.139 --> 25:45.509
I kind of forgot
about all my problems
for a little bit.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.779
( vocalizing )

25:48.814 --> 25:52.783
dipper scott, we'll see you
at the head-to-heads.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.920
<i> I'm singing "believer"</i>
<i> by imagine dragons.</i>

25:55.955 --> 26:00.558
<i> I have crohn's disease,</i>
<i> and when dan reynolds</i>
<i> wrote this song,</i>

26:00.593 --> 26:02.726
he actually was dealing with
something similar to me,

26:02.762 --> 26:05.262
like, with physical
chronic illness.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.531
<i> I do want to stay</i>
<i> in this competition.</i>

26:07.567 --> 26:12.369
There's $100,000 prize,
and I would pay off

26:12.438 --> 26:13.904
as many medical bills
as possible.

26:13.940 --> 26:17.775
<i> And getting actual, like,</i>
<i> mentorship from the judges</i>

26:17.810 --> 26:19.977

You deserve it,
dipper scott.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.475
- Yeah.
- Wow.

27:58.511 --> 27:59.710
Thank you.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.745
Before we keep going,
let's show a lot of love

28:01.781 --> 28:03.781
to the incredible musicians

28:03.816 --> 28:06.884
backing up
our alter egos tonight.

28:06.952 --> 28:11.021
It's adam blackstone
and the alter ego band.

28:11.057 --> 28:13.724
Judges, it really all
comes down to your decision.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.493
Does dipper scott
belong in the semi-finals?

28:16.495 --> 28:18.962
Grimes, we're gonna
start with you.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.298
Uh, I'm not gonna lie.
Dipper's my favorite.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.701
Um...

28:25.104 --> 28:28.739
It's grimes
the poker player again.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.708
Like, I don't know.
Like, you just have it.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.744
- You have star power.
- Thank you.

28:33.746 --> 28:37.381
Dipper, I just-- I mean,
I can't understand why you're
not a superstar already.

28:37.383 --> 28:40.250
- Like...
- ( cheering )

28:40.319 --> 28:42.553
I guess I did it
with dipper's help, you know?

28:42.588 --> 28:45.989
He made it possible.
Dipper made this possible,
you know?

28:46.025 --> 28:50.461
Because-- why would you
have been afraid to step up
without dipper?

28:50.463 --> 28:52.930
Well, my confidence
is lacking in some areas,

28:52.998 --> 28:54.732
and dipper kind of fills in
the gaps a little bit.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.935
Maybe he'll help me
get out there the way
I want to be seen.

28:59.472 --> 29:02.439
Yeah, I just think you're
an incredible superstar.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.976
Thank you.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.144
I-I-I'm lost for words.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.213
It's very rare
that I can't find the word.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.582
But if there was a word--

29:11.617 --> 29:15.786
let me look for it.
Hold on. Hold on.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.721
The word is...

29:17.790 --> 29:19.056
"hell, yeah."

29:20.526 --> 29:22.259
nick:
Two. Two words.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.361
- Is that two words?
- That's two words.

29:24.430 --> 29:28.932
Not-- in my neighborhood,
that's one word.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.901
When we return,
we'll see if dipper scott

29:30.903 --> 29:32.569
will stay in the competition,

29:32.638 --> 29:34.705
or will phoenix embers
get the diamond

29:34.740 --> 29:36.540
and go to the semi-finals?

29:36.542 --> 29:39.376
She will perform next.
Anything could happen.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.078
This is "alter ego,"
after all.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.146
More show after this.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.815
I'm just a massive dipper fan.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.784
Well, you don't have
to apologize for that.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.592
Welcome back to "alter ego."

29:55.628 --> 29:58.262
dipper scott
just absolutely owned

29:58.264 --> 29:59.930
his head-to-head performance,

29:59.999 --> 30:04.401
but will it be enough
to move on to the semi-finals?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.703
That all depends
on what our next alter ego

30:06.739 --> 30:07.871
can bring
to the stage tonight.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.707
So please give it up
for phoenix embers.

30:10.743 --> 30:13.677
Yeah!

30:13.712 --> 30:18.615

completely dormant,
I guess you could say.

30:32.898 --> 30:35.833
To get the response from
the judges the way that I did,

30:35.835 --> 30:37.801
it was overwhelming.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.670
What also took me
a little further

30:39.705 --> 30:42.072
was the love I have
for your story.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.540

Thank you.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.518
That is my greatest desire,

Whoo, relieved

33:15.461 --> 33:19.129
I'm so curious what to judges
thought of that. Nick?

33:19.198 --> 33:21.531
Your vocal came in
like a wrecking ball.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.534
I mean, that's-- it was--

33:24.603 --> 33:26.236
wow, thank you.

33:26.271 --> 33:29.306
We're trying to find
this next generation superstar.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.476
Which leads me to ask you,
who are you as a performer?

33:32.511 --> 33:34.911
I love to remind people

33:34.947 --> 33:38.548
of the feeling of being alive.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.917
Being able to draw
that emotion

33:40.953 --> 33:43.387
and that kind
of awakening experience

33:43.389 --> 33:45.322
is what really excites me.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.525
Rocsi: Will.I.Am?

33:48.560 --> 33:51.194
I believe in that
performance right there.

33:51.230 --> 33:54.197
That was, like, wow-wow sauce.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.266
That was pretty
freaking awesome.

33:56.301 --> 33:59.202
And the crowd stood up.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.238
You did that,
so thank you so much.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.343
Alanis?

34:06.345 --> 34:10.013
"wrecking ball"
is one of my top 20
favorite songs of all time.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.915
So when you started
singing, I thought,

34:11.950 --> 34:15.052
"oh, please, please,
please, please knock this
out of the park."

34:15.120 --> 34:18.655
- and you did.
- Oh, my gosh.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.224
We're looking for that charisma,
je ne sais quoi.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.726
I mean,
there's a lot of things
we're looking at.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.861
It's a package deal,
and you nailed it,

34:24.897 --> 34:26.430
so triple thumbs up.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.265
Oh, thank you.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.301
Well, grimes?

34:31.336 --> 34:32.736
Yeah, I thought
that was excellent.

34:32.805 --> 34:36.673
I like your vibe as a human--
or not a human. As a--

34:38.343 --> 34:41.545
um, yeah, I was,
like, really digging your
personality from day one

34:41.580 --> 34:42.746
and, like, your story
and everything.

34:42.748 --> 34:46.083
Wow. Thank you.

34:46.118 --> 34:47.918
Incredible.

34:47.953 --> 34:50.020
When we come back,
it's up to the judges to decide

34:50.055 --> 34:53.390
who will be moving on
and who will be leaving
the competition tonight.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.394
Will it be phoenix embers
or dipper scott?

34:57.429 --> 34:59.830
But before the eliminated
alter ego leaves,

34:59.865 --> 35:03.233
they will reveal their
true identities to the judges.

35:03.268 --> 35:07.237
We'll be right back with more
"alter ego" on fox after this.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.406
Neither one of them
could've done anything more.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.941
- Definitely.
- She came out like
a rock star and...

35:10.976 --> 35:13.110
- She's awesome.
- These head-to-heads
are tough, man.

35:19.651 --> 35:22.652
<i> Talent, get to your marks.</i>

35:22.688 --> 35:25.989
<i> Going to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

35:33.265 --> 35:36.533
Welcome back to "alter ego."
what a night.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.503
We're about to find out
which alter ego

35:39.538 --> 35:40.670
from this head-to-head
match-up,

35:40.672 --> 35:44.040
phoenix embers
or dipper scott,

35:44.076 --> 35:47.978
will be voted
into the semi-finals
alongside safara.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.914
And which one will sadly
head home,

35:50.949 --> 35:54.117
revealing their true identity
to the judges.

35:54.153 --> 35:56.553
This is gonna be
so, so, so tough.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.389
But, judges,
it's time for your votes.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.532
Grimes, we're gonna
start with you.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.769
Based on their talent,
image, personality,

36:12.838 --> 36:14.437
who would you want to mentor?

36:14.473 --> 36:18.508
Phoenix, I think
you really came alive for me
tonight as an artist.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.911
- Wow, thank you.
- But for me, ultimately,

36:20.946 --> 36:23.580
I feel that dipper
kind of has that thing.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.215
Like, I don't even know
why it's so good,

36:25.250 --> 36:28.051
I just, like,
want to see more.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.654
I want to search you on youtube,
I want to, like, be a fan.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.756
And it's like,
he's sort of the main artist

36:32.791 --> 36:34.758
from the whole competition
to me that has stood out
in that regard,

36:34.793 --> 36:38.228
and so I'm gonna have
to save dipper.

36:43.068 --> 36:48.238
Alanis, which one of these
alter egos is the total package?

36:48.273 --> 36:51.708
Phoenix embers,
I love your voice,

36:51.710 --> 36:55.545
and there's that moment
when you're about to perform

36:55.581 --> 36:58.748
and there's just this look
in your alter ego eyes.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.817
That was so fierce.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.719
I think you
in the public eye

37:02.788 --> 37:06.923
would be a really
beautiful thing.

37:06.992 --> 37:09.059
Dipper, your voice
is perfection,

37:09.094 --> 37:10.860
and just your whole vibe,
your whole energy

37:10.896 --> 37:13.129
is really alluring
and enticing.

37:13.165 --> 37:18.435
However, I am actually
going to ask phoenix embers
to step on that diamond.

37:20.872 --> 37:23.273
- Rocsi: Okay. Nick?
- I could see both of you

37:23.308 --> 37:25.575
as that
next generation superstar

37:25.611 --> 37:27.877
onstage in front
of thousands of people,

37:27.913 --> 37:30.580
selling t-shirts,
on the sides of busses.

37:30.582 --> 37:36.152
And, for me, what's intriguing
about those mega-superstars

37:36.188 --> 37:37.687
is that bit of mystery, right,

37:37.756 --> 37:39.889
that sucks us in
time after time.

37:39.958 --> 37:43.660
And there's just something
about dipper scott

37:43.695 --> 37:47.430
that I just gotta know
more about,

37:47.466 --> 37:50.300
and so I'm voting for dipper
to be on the diamond.

37:53.705 --> 37:58.475
Two votes for dipper scott.
One vote for phoenix embers.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.544
Will, it is all on you.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.614
Phoenix has the kind of voice

38:04.650 --> 38:07.417
that I want to go in
the studio with right away

38:07.419 --> 38:12.822
'cause I know exactly
how to work with that type
of voice, producing.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.725
Dipper, I don't mean
this in a disrespect,

38:15.761 --> 38:18.461
but most of my favorite
artists are weird.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.731
And every single one of them

38:21.767 --> 38:23.700
are weird
in their own little way.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.902
They all have
this unique thing.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.538
And dipper scott

38:28.573 --> 38:32.309
is one of those types
of artists.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.978
So I would see dipper scott
on the diamond.

38:37.783 --> 38:40.984
Rocsi:
That is three votes
for dipper scott.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.286
You're on the diamond

38:43.355 --> 38:47.157
and will be moving on
to the semi-finals.

38:47.192 --> 38:50.660
Congratulations,
dipper scott.

38:50.696 --> 38:54.064
Wow. We'll see you
at the semi-finals.

38:56.234 --> 38:58.401
I'm so sorry, phoenix embers.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.538
This is where the competition
ends for you,

39:01.573 --> 39:06.743
but it would be an honor
to hear you sing
one last time for us

39:06.778 --> 39:09.245
and meet the judges in person.

39:09.281 --> 39:10.947
Are you up for that?

39:10.982 --> 39:13.249
- I'll pull myself together.
- Rocsi: Oh.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.855
Everyone, here for one last time
on the "alter ego" stage,

39:18.890 --> 39:21.891
give it up for phoenix embers.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.260
Yeah, phoenix!

39:30.569 --> 39:33.470
- That was a tough one.
- You could just see
her crumbling, like...

39:33.505 --> 39:35.104
- Yeah.
- That's one of my least
favorite moments

39:35.107 --> 39:37.907
- in doing tv.
- She's gone through a lot
and is resilient.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.175
So when that phoenix is rising,

39:39.210 --> 39:41.578
it's rising
from the ashes, so...

39:43.181 --> 39:45.815

41:09.000 --> 41:14.070
It is my pleasure
to introduce danielle,

41:14.072 --> 41:17.574
aka phoenix embers,
everybody.

41:19.911 --> 41:23.746
How did phoenix embers
help you?

41:23.748 --> 41:27.817
It's crazy because
I completely gave up singing
a few years ago.

41:27.886 --> 41:32.922
Just a lot of really
negative voices began to win,

41:32.958 --> 41:34.991
and I believed them, sadly.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.794
So then when I was told
about this show,

41:37.829 --> 41:40.797
I thought, what a greater way
to show my girls

41:40.832 --> 41:45.635
to take that last chance
to just go after your dreams.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.203
Yeah, this was a huge
turning point for me

41:47.239 --> 41:51.241
with having phoenix
as my alter ego to hide behind.

41:51.276 --> 41:54.043
And, yeah,
she definitely just unlocked
a new side of myself.

41:54.079 --> 41:57.313
You are so talented
and you are so deserving.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.916
And that feeling
that she brought to you?

41:59.951 --> 42:01.951
- Yeah?
- Take that with you.

42:01.987 --> 42:04.621
If you have a renewed sense
of what music means to you...

42:04.656 --> 42:06.556
- Yeah.
- ...That's the best thing

42:06.625 --> 42:08.424
- that could come out
of this show.
- Yeah.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.426
That's what it's about.
Take it with you.

42:10.462 --> 42:12.529
- Yeah.
- You are far too talented.

42:12.597 --> 42:13.730
Danielle: Thank you.

42:13.798 --> 42:17.066
Just speak to
your having tabled music

42:17.068 --> 42:18.601
while raising children,

42:18.637 --> 42:20.403
I just feel like
there's enough time

42:20.438 --> 42:23.273
and there's enough love
that you pick the timing

42:23.308 --> 42:25.542
and the patterns
and the rhythms and the seasons.

42:25.577 --> 42:27.377
- Yeah.
- I love what you've chosen

42:27.445 --> 42:29.812
and what you've prioritized
and what you value,

42:29.881 --> 42:32.215
and I look forward
to seeing what your next
chapter looks like.

42:32.284 --> 42:35.552
- Thank you.
- One more time please

42:35.587 --> 42:40.056
for danielle,
aka phoenix embers.

42:40.125 --> 42:45.628
Wow, this was an intense
night of competition.

42:45.630 --> 42:48.598
Congratulations to safara
and dipper scott.

42:48.633 --> 42:51.034
- We're coming in!
- We'll see you
in the semi-finals.

42:51.036 --> 42:54.637
Next week, another
four alter egos face off.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.539
You're not going
to want to miss it.
Everybody, good night.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.345
- You're awesome, danielle.
- Thank you.
