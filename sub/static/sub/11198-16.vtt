00:05.880 --> 00:08.400
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:08.480 --> 00:12.040
This is the base of the Tauri.
Why are there Jaffa?

00:12.120 --> 00:15.960
- Rebel warriors.
- Jaffa who've turned against the Goa'uld.

00:16.040 --> 00:19.760
- Is that going to be a problem?
- Not for us.

00:22.240 --> 00:26.160
Somebody want to tell me
what's going on here?

00:26.240 --> 00:27.280
It's history.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.680
For 2,000 years, every time a Tok'ra died
by a staff weapon, a Jaffa was holding it.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.240
This was obviously intended
to be a new form of foot soldier.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.080
I serve Anubis.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.520
He's got the strength
and healing powers of a normal Goa'uld,

00:44.600 --> 00:46.920
but none of the normal personality traits.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.200
(Selmak) This being was not alive
when it was first grown.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.920
Frankenstein's monster.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.480
(Selmak) Thousands of years ago Goa'uld
found a device created by the Ancients.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.640
With it, maybe we can devise a weapon
to counteract its life-giving energy.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.920
- Where's the matrix crystal?
- By the primaries.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.480
I can't find anything in here.
I had a system at the Alpha site.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.400
Its location was compromised when
Anubis used his mind probe on Jonas.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.360
- Did you really want to hang around?
- I want to work as efficiently as possible.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.080
Anubis' drones are kicking the crap
out of the System Lords. We're next.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.640
This prototype should've
been done weeks ago.

01:43.720 --> 01:49.160
- It's done. It's just not... finished.
- Interesting distinction.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.600
We just got Telchak's device. I'm amazed
we came up with something so quickly.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.800
In this form, it's only 70% effective
in countering the reanimation technology.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.440
That's because your power unit hasn't
been properly calibrated. This'll be better.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.880
Maybe.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.440
Have you not had
your coffee this morning?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.600
Selmak doesn't like coffee.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.160
You gave up coffee for your symbiote?

02:18.200 --> 02:21.280
- I didn't know that.
- We never talk any more, Sam.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.760
(sighs)

02:22.840 --> 02:25.080
(alarm)

02:26.000 --> 02:28.120
- What's happening?
- We're under attack.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.560
Goa'uld ships entering the atmosphere.
Colonel Riley's ordered evac to Beta.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.960
We're bugging out right now.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.880
(O'Neill) What happened?

03:50.960 --> 03:54.120
Approximately 20 minutes ago,
the approach of Goa'uld ships

03:54.200 --> 03:58.320
- prompted evacuation of the Alpha site.
- Sam was doing research there.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.960
She and Jacob were working on a weapon
to neutralise Anubis' new soldiers.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.600
We have no idea what
happened to either of them.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.640
- How many people got out?
- Casualty reports are still coming in,

04:09.720 --> 04:13.440
but 90 are still missing, including
the base commander, Colonel Riley.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.399
I thought the location
of the Alpha site was secret.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.680
It's a completely new address.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.720
Evidently the Goa'uld
have discovered its whereabouts.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.000
Chevron seven locked.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.720
Wormhole stable, sir.
No radio chatter.

04:33.480 --> 04:36.960
- Send the MALP.
- Yes, sir.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.520
MALP is en route.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.280
Receiving MALP telemetry.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.560
My instruments say
the MALP is on its side.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.160
- You still have camera control?
- Yes, sir.

05:08.480 --> 05:13.560
If the Stargate fell over and it's face down,
the event horizon would've dug a cavity.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.080
When the MALP came through
it fell into the hole.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.760
There's no way to know
if the DHD survived.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.720
- If we had another power source...
- We can dial out manually.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.400
- Possibly under enemy fire.
- We'll be fine, sir.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.400
The gate dug the perfect foxhole.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.440
- You have a go. Good luck, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.800
Wow.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.160
This destruction does not
appear to be from aerial assault.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.200
Single-radius blast.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.000
Quite possibly the self-destruct...

06:22.680 --> 06:26.680
to prevent the Alpha site
from falling into enemy hands.

06:33.200 --> 06:39.200
- So, we'll split up, search for survivors.
- Who could've survived this?

06:40.640 --> 06:44.000
- Start with the tree line there.
- Copy.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.760
Move out.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.720
O'Neill?

07:30.640 --> 07:32.840
What do you got?

07:38.040 --> 07:41.720
This is the armour
of one of Anubis' drones.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.560
Reynolds?

07:52.720 --> 07:56.360
- Go ahead.
- Be advised. We may not be alone here.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.800
At least one of Anubis' goons might
have been on the planet when it blew.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.120
Use extreme caution.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
Understood.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.640
(twig snaps)

08:23.600 --> 08:25.320
Colonel.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.880
Major Green. You all right?

08:28.960 --> 08:32.919
I'm fine, sir.
We got some serious injuries here.

08:35.240 --> 08:40.039
- Any other survivors in the area?
- As far as I know, we're the only ones, sir.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.400
- O'Neill?
- Go ahead.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.920
- Found 12, but they're not in good shape.
- How bad?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.240
Some can walk, but most need
immediate medical treatment.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.600
Major Carter with 'em?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.400
I'm afraid not.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.720
(O'Neill) SG-3's gonna need help
to get the gate back up.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.680
SGs 11 and 21 are assembling now.
I'll be sending them through momentarily.

09:11.760 --> 09:16.560
However, that means a delay before I can
send any other resources to help search.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.920
Getting the wounded out is our priority.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.920
Agreed, but if there are any other
survivors they may not have a lot of time.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.400
Understood, sir. We'll keep trying.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.280
Jacob!

09:43.680 --> 09:46.960
- (Jacob) Anubis' drones.
- We know.

09:47.040 --> 09:51.520
Take this. It's not 100%,
but it's all we've got.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.440
It only has a few more shots.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.320
Sam has a fully-charged power unit.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.720
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.840
I don't even know if she's still alive.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.800
- How are you doing?
- It's nothing Selmak can't handle.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.360
We need to know what happened.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.360
How did Anubis get the location
to the new Alpha site?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.720
I have no idea.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.000
I was with Sam when
the self-destruct went off.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.080
One of the drones was
chasing us into the forest.

10:50.160 --> 10:56.120
George, if I survived the blast,
you know that thing survived as well.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.480
- What about the prototype weapon?
- I gave it to Colonel O'Neill.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.360
But it's only semieffective
in its current configuration.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.680
The upgraded power unit was with Sam.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.200
- And we have no idea where she is?
- She's still missing.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.160
Is there anything else we can use
against these drones?

11:16.240 --> 11:19.880
Their armour is impervious
to energy weapons and regular firearms.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.280
What about the drones killed in the blast?

11:22.360 --> 11:26.400
Kinetic energy, an explosion of that size...
They can't ignore physics.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.200
- So with enough kinetic energy...
- It would have to be a lot.

11:31.280 --> 11:36.720
- How about a missile?
- That might do it, if you get close enough.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.680
Sergeant Siler.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.200
- Prepare a UAV with UCAV specs.
- Yes, sir.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.840
Am I in trouble, sir?

11:56.920 --> 12:02.400
The Alpha site has been compromised,
indicating we've got a security breach.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.960
The Pentagon is demanding
I launch a formal inquiry immediately.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.160
Just tell me what happened, son.

12:09.240 --> 12:14.160
To tell you the truth, I'm not entirely sure. I
was still at chow when the alarm went off.

12:14.240 --> 12:18.400
By the time I got to the command centre,
Colonel Riley had ordered the evacuation.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.760
- What about the Stargate?
- It was hit by an Alkesh bomber.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.320
We were cut off. That's when
the drones landed in scout ships.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.920
They took all we threw at them
and just kept coming.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.520
So Colonel Riley
ordered the self-destruct?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.160
He knew there was
sensitive material on the base.

12:33.240 --> 12:36.960
He stayed with the device
so the enemy couldn't disarm it.

12:37.040 --> 12:42.640
He told the rest of us that we had
one minute to make it to the tree line.

12:43.560 --> 12:49.040
- I should've stayed with him.
- You were following orders, Major.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.960
Yes, sir.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.600
Was there any unusual activity
at the Alpha site in the last few days?

12:56.680 --> 13:00.680
Any unscheduled gate activations
or unexplained signals?

13:00.760 --> 13:05.160
- No, sir.
- What about the Jaffa and the Tok'ra?

13:06.160 --> 13:10.600
They haven't been getting along very well,
but there's nothing unusual about that.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.160
I want a list of all personnel -
human, Tok'ra and Jaffa -

13:14.240 --> 13:17.440
who've used the Alpha site gate
in the last 48 hours.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.520
Yes, sir.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.400
(Teal'c) Footprints.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.400
Standard issue from the SGC.

13:36.480 --> 13:41.320
Indeed. The depth of the impression
is consistent with Major Carter's size.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.720
- There's another set over there.
- Someone much larger.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.400
Perhaps a drone.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.000
Yeah.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.080
Do you believe this prototype weapon
will be effective against it?

13:55.160 --> 13:58.760
We'll jump off that bridge
when we come to it.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.680
- So how's the leg?
- Getting there, slowly but surely.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.960
Yeah, slowly. The way you heal,
it'll probably take a day.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.600
You didn't come here
to ask me about my leg.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.880
You want to know what happened to Sam.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.000
Yeah.

14:21.800 --> 14:27.800
The base was under attack. We could
hear the explosions getting closer,

14:27.880 --> 14:31.360
and the sound
of scout ships approaching.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.960
- We have to leave now!
- Just gimme a second!

14:35.040 --> 14:39.080
(Jacob) But we had to download the
weapon design into the matrix crystal

14:39.160 --> 14:41.000
and wipe the computer memory.

14:41.080 --> 14:46.160
- You have the prototype!
- We can't leave this data for them to find.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.240
- How much longer?
- Finished!

15:05.720 --> 15:07.720
It worked.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.360
Not good enough.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.640
Let's get the hell out of here.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.920
The Stargate was hit.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.160
We couldn't get out...

15:24.240 --> 15:26.960
so we ran for the hills.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.880
The drone followed us.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.840
If Sam is still alive, it's still after her.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.400
Maybe it was just hiding,
waiting to go back through the gate.

15:40.480 --> 15:46.480
Out of all the rooms on that base,
why did it come to that lab?

15:48.080 --> 15:51.440
And why did it chase us,
as opposed to anyone else?

15:51.520 --> 15:55.280
You think it knew about the prototype?

15:55.360 --> 15:59.600
I think that was
the whole reason for the attack.

15:59.680 --> 16:06.280
Anubis knows we have the only weapon
in the galaxy able to stop his soldiers.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.720
And Sam has the design.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.880
That thing won't stop until it finds her.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.520
- Sergeant Siler, report.
- It's ready to go.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.680
- Well done. I want it airborne now.
- Yes, sir.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.720
General, the leader of the Jaffa survivors
is cleared for debriefing.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.680
- I want to speak to him immediately.
- Yes, sir.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.560
- I do not know why I'm being questioned.
- We need to determine what happened.

16:43.640 --> 16:47.720
If you wish to know who betrayed
your base, I suggest you ask the Tok'ra.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.640
- Why do you say that?
- They are without honour.

16:50.720 --> 16:53.560
- They're your allies.
- Then why will they not help us?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.680
- What do you mean?
- Even as we speak,

16:55.760 --> 16:58.600
Anubis is moving against
the System Lord Olokun.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.280
Drones slaughter Jaffa
that stand against them.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.000
- They are dying for a hopeless cause.
- What's that got to do with the Tok'ra?

17:05.079 --> 17:09.839
We believe they have a spy in Olokun's
higher ranks, close enough to kill him.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.440
The Tok'ra inform us of their operations.

17:12.520 --> 17:16.359
I have no knowledge
of any spy in Olokun's ranks.

17:16.440 --> 17:20.440
Then they are lying to you too. With their
master dead, the siege would be over

17:20.520 --> 17:23.400
and Olokun's Jaffa would be
free to join our movement.

17:23.480 --> 17:30.120
Our logs show that a group of Jaffa left the
site less than 24 hours before the attack.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.040
- You sent your own people, didn't you?
- Yes.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.600
- Have they reported back?
- They have not.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.120
- If they were captured by Anubis...
- No Jaffa would yield to torture.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.520
Anubis doesn't have to resort to torture.

17:42.600 --> 17:47.160
He has technology that allows him
to simply read a prisoner's mind.

17:47.240 --> 17:52.120
When Heru-ur was killed, I was forced
to pledge allegiance to Apophis.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.840
The slayer of my master
became my master.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.760
So it has been for all Jaffa
for thousands of years.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.800
But now we can choose to fight our
oppressors. We can choose to be free.

18:01.880 --> 18:07.600
I ask only that the Jaffa who serve Olokun
be given that same choice.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.760
If you let me go to the Beta site
to speak to the other survivors,

18:11.840 --> 18:16.440
I may be able to discover
what happened to the Jaffa we sent.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.360
Very well.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.320
- (Hammond) Colonel O'Neill?
- General.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.120
Status report.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.840
We found tracks, sir.
They could be Carter's.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.880
- What direction?
- East, up into the hills.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.360
The high ground
is a more defensible position.

18:36.440 --> 18:41.800
Understood. I'll have the UAV fly a
search pattern in that area. Hammond out.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.960
(footsteps)

19:26.480 --> 19:28.480
(footsteps fade)

19:39.880 --> 19:41.600
Jacob.

19:42.520 --> 19:45.760
- Any news on Sam?
- Not yet.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.120
We have a UAV airborne
and all available SG teams are searching.

19:50.640 --> 19:56.640
I don't know anyone tougher or more
resourceful. She'll find a way out of this.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.880
How's the investigation going?

20:00.960 --> 20:03.360
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

20:03.440 --> 20:07.520
Do you know anything about
a Tok'ra operative within Olokun's ranks?

20:07.600 --> 20:08.680
No.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.440
The Jaffa say
you have a spy in his inner circle.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.120
They're mistaken.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.400
- (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
- (alarm)

20:25.160 --> 20:28.520
Did you learn anything at the Beta site?

20:28.600 --> 20:32.960
Of the Jaffa sent to recruit rebels from
Olokun's army, only one has returned.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.240
The fate of the others is unknown.
Anubis has won a major victory.

20:37.320 --> 20:42.000
Thousands of Jaffa have been killed, and
many of Olokun's commanders captured.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.800
- The Tok'ra spy among them.
- That's impossible.

20:44.880 --> 20:49.080
If we had someone on the inside,
I would've known about it.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.160
Are you sure?

22:20.680 --> 22:23.440
Thank you for
your cooperation in this, Delek.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.920
I do not see the need
to continue this investigation, General.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.640
The Jaffa have as much as
admitted responsibility.

22:29.720 --> 22:36.040
All we know is that some of the men
they sent to recruit rebels didn't return.

22:36.120 --> 22:41.120
They were captured in Anubis' latest
offensive. It is the logical explanation.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.800
According to the Jaffa,
a Tok'ra spy was also captured.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.640
We both know Jaffa intelligence
is not always as reliable as it should be.

22:49.720 --> 22:54.400
So you're saying you had
no operative in Olokun's ranks?

22:55.400 --> 22:58.200
I am unable to discuss
such matters at present.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.440
The terms of our alliance
dictate full disclosure.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.120
In matters of joint concern.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.160
Security of the Alpha site
is a matter of joint concern.

23:06.240 --> 23:11.560
The disposition of our operatives has no
bearing on the security of the Alpha site.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.320
So you claim.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.080
You have allies amongst
the other nations of Earth.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.280
Of course.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.520
Do you always practise
full disclosure with them?

23:21.600 --> 23:24.920
We gave you shelter
when you had nowhere else to go.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.640
Because you needed us. Just as you
brought us Telchak's reanimation device

23:29.720 --> 23:34.480
because you needed our help to develop
a weapon against Anubis' drones.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.480
But you are not always so forthcoming.

23:37.560 --> 23:44.120
For example, your programme to build
hybrid ships using Goa'uld technologies.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.880
A programme the Tok'ra feel
is extremely unwise.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.760
We need those ships
for the defence of Earth.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.240
And so you feel it is
none of our concern.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.600
You see, General, it works both ways.
You ask us to trust

23:56.680 --> 24:02.160
that your headlong pursuit of technologies
that you don't understand poses no threat.

24:02.240 --> 24:07.200
But you fail to offer similar consideration
with our policy on using covert operatives.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.160
Let me ask you something.

24:10.240 --> 24:15.200
How many Tok'ra from the Alpha site
are still unaccounted for?

24:15.280 --> 24:18.120
- Five.
- Do you know how many I'm missing?

24:18.200 --> 24:20.600
64.

24:21.160 --> 24:27.360
Believe me, I'm going to get to the bottom
of this, with or without your help.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.080
I've been expecting you.

25:22.560 --> 25:26.240
No doubt you've spoken
to General Hammond.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.840
(Jacob) He says he asked you
if we had a spy in Olokun's inner circle.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.400
Yes, he did.

25:34.480 --> 25:39.280
He asked me the same question.
Of course I told him no,

25:39.360 --> 25:43.240
because only the High Council
could make a decision like that,

25:43.320 --> 25:48.480
and since I'm on the High Council,
I would know about it. Wouldn't I?

25:50.160 --> 25:51.920
Got something to tell me?

25:52.000 --> 25:55.840
If you have a concern, you can
take it up with the Council yourself.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.240
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- An interesting question.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.320
It seems I am talking to a human host.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.560
(Selmak) Make no mistake, Delek.

26:11.640 --> 26:17.480
I am still Selmak, and I was a leader of the
Tok'ra before you had even taken a host.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.280
Maybe you've been a leader too long.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.760
The Tauri are unlike
other humans in the galaxy.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.720
Their will has not been eroded
by thousands of years of slavery.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.160
This can be a valuable asset,
but it can also make them dangerous.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.960
Particularly as hosts.

26:33.040 --> 26:36.880
Jacob Carter has had no more
influence on me than any other host.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.120
There are those of us
who would disagree.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.480
You have allowed yourself
to get too close to these people.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.640
Your true loyalties are in question.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.640
You speak for the entire Council?

26:50.720 --> 26:56.360
You still have your defenders,
although their numbers are diminishing.

26:56.440 --> 27:00.920
So you did meet without me.
And you did send an operative.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.720
And if you had known,
would you have told General Hammond?

27:04.800 --> 27:07.800
They have a right to know.

27:07.880 --> 27:13.840
We knew you would feel that way, which
is precisely why you were not informed.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.480
So Delek admits that
this spy has gone missing.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.560
Yes.

27:25.640 --> 27:30.480
But the Tok'ra will never acknowledge
that he could have been responsible.

27:30.560 --> 27:34.240
Tok'ra operatives have orders
never to be taken alive.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.040
What about a sarcophagus?

27:36.120 --> 27:42.160
They take precautions to ensure the brain
is not left intact. No revival is possible.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.200
This is all assuming
the man wasn't taken unawares.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.200
The system isn't foolproof,
but they won't admit that.

27:49.280 --> 27:54.720
The truth is, I don't think you'll ever
find out who was responsible for the leak.

27:55.240 --> 28:00.040
It could've been the Tok'ra or the Jaffa.
It could've been both. Look...

28:00.120 --> 28:05.920
I've helped as much as I can with this, but
now I'd like to get back to join the search.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.440
- I need you here.
- I already told you, I'm out of the loop.

28:09.520 --> 28:13.640
They don't trust me any more. They think
my emotions are clouding my judgment.

28:13.720 --> 28:19.680
Ironic, considering I'm wasting time while
my daughter is being hunted by that thing.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.840
We have our best people on this.
They will find her.

28:22.920 --> 28:26.160
- What do I do until then?
- I just got a report from the Beta site.

28:26.240 --> 28:31.080
The Jaffa are blaming the Tok'ra for what
happened. There have been altercations.

28:31.160 --> 28:35.600
If I can't get the situation under control,
I have orders to expel them all.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.560
Our alliance is falling apart.

28:39.480 --> 28:43.840
I need someone to bridge the gap,
someone to be the voice of reason.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.040
I need you.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.360
(plane overhead)

29:32.400 --> 29:34.800
- (Reynolds) O'Neill?
- Go ahead.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.560
The UAVhas been
shot down in your area.

29:37.640 --> 29:44.440
It's four clicks away on a heading of
320 degrees from your present location.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.080
We're on it.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.760
Why have you asked me here?

30:03.720 --> 30:06.240
- You know what's happening at Beta site.
- I do.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.760
We need your help to put a stop to it
before it gets out of hand.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.400
You're a leader amongst the Jaffa.
They'll listen to you.

30:15.120 --> 30:20.120
What should I say? They must continue
to bear the arrogance of the Tok'ra?

30:20.200 --> 30:25.640
They must be subservient to those who
had sacrificed so many of their brothers?

30:27.720 --> 30:31.080
(Selmak) The Jaffa have always been
dependent on the Goa'uld

30:31.160 --> 30:34.280
because they need symbiotes
to sustain them.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.840
But now there is
a substance called tretonin,

30:36.920 --> 30:39.640
which can free the Jaffa
from this dependence.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.760
I am aware of its significance.

30:41.840 --> 30:47.640
Are you also aware that millions of
Tok'ra symbiotes died in its development,

30:47.720 --> 30:50.680
including our beloved Queen Egeria,

30:50.760 --> 30:54.760
the queen from whom
all our lineage can be traced?

30:55.760 --> 30:58.240
- I was not.
- For the first time,

30:58.320 --> 31:04.800
the Tok'ra have fought alongside the Jaffa
and the Tauri, and it's made a difference.

31:04.880 --> 31:11.360
More System Lords have fallen in the past
seven years than in the 700 years before.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.440
It is true that together we are strong.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.440
And, divided, we will die.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.360
(Jacob) We cannot let our alliance end.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.360
Your words are wise,

31:32.440 --> 31:36.880
but my time at the Alpha site
has taught me some bitter lessons.

31:36.960 --> 31:41.040
I suspect that you
do not speak for all the Tok'ra.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.080
No.

31:46.040 --> 31:51.280
Until the others feel as you do,
reconciliation may not be possible.

32:52.760 --> 32:58.800
Gentlemen, we need your help to keep the
situation at Beta from getting out of hand.

32:58.880 --> 33:03.840
I'm not sure what you expect of the
Tok'ra. We've had unprovoked assaults.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.200
Unprovoked? You refused to help us
and thousands of Jaffa died needlessly.

33:08.280 --> 33:12.920
- Assassinating Olokun was not an option.
- Why not?

33:13.000 --> 33:16.080
We didn't know how many Jaffa
would join the rebels.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.840
We could have delivered
an army into Anubis' hands.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.440
They deserved the right to choose.
Instead, they were slaughtered.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.120
We have fought the Goa'uld
for thousands of years.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.480
You have no right
to question our methods.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.040
You were alone.
You have allies now.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.920
What good has it done us?

33:32.000 --> 33:36.720
Since we have been allies, your tendency
to provoke confrontation with the Goa'uld

33:36.800 --> 33:40.600
has resulted in the deaths of more Tok'ra
than in the previous hundred years.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.360
I hate to admit it,
but he's got a point.

33:43.440 --> 33:48.200
When a human or a Jaffa dies,
more are born to take their place.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.080
Not so for the Tok'ra.

33:50.160 --> 33:54.800
Our Queen Egeria, from whom
all Tok'ra have spawned, is dead.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.360
Our numbers are dwindling.

33:57.440 --> 34:01.680
This alliance may simply
be something we cannot afford.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.040
(rubble moving)

36:10.320 --> 36:13.160
Carter, I need the...

36:13.240 --> 36:15.640
Thanks.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.200
Cover him.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.880
Is it...

36:42.240 --> 36:44.480
Yeah, he's dead.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.920
Right, Teal'c? He's dead?

36:51.760 --> 36:53.760
Yeah, he's dead.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.160
Wanna get up?

37:03.240 --> 37:05.840
I just need to rest for a minute.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.800
Come here.

37:53.360 --> 37:57.280
First of all, we'd like to congratulate
you on the recovery of Major Carter.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.160
- We are glad to know that she is safe.
- Thank you.

38:00.240 --> 38:04.560
I have spoken to the High Council with
regard to the situation at the Beta site.

38:04.640 --> 38:09.440
- They believe the best solution is to leave.
- Is that really necessary?

38:09.520 --> 38:11.920
If this partnership were to continue,

38:12.000 --> 38:15.240
you would insist on full disclosure
of our covert operations.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.600
I'm afraid that's non-negotiable.

38:17.680 --> 38:19.880
In that case, we must refuse.

38:19.960 --> 38:24.000
Secrecy is our only weapon.
It's all we've ever known.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.120
The Jaffa, too, will be leaving.

38:26.200 --> 38:30.760
- But with the Tok'ra gone...
- We are not leaving because of them.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.160
We are leaving because
it is what we must do.

38:33.240 --> 38:38.000
On your base, you dictate the terms. We
must consult you before we take action.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.880
There are those among us who feel
we simply traded one master for another.

38:41.960 --> 38:46.600
We're not trying to tell you what to do. We
simply think it's vital to coordinate efforts.

38:46.680 --> 38:51.280
Unlike the Tauri or the Tok'ra, the Jaffa
are still learning what it means to be free.

38:51.360 --> 38:56.080
To do this, we must have our own bases,
our own leaders, our own communities.

38:56.160 --> 39:00.040
We must do this for ourselves,
or it would have no meaning.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.800
Only then can we be
equal partners in any alliance.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.280
I'm sorry, this is nuts.

39:05.360 --> 39:09.600
My friend almost died so we could get
a weapon able to stop Anubis' soldiers.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.680
Now we're finally able to really make
a difference, and you want to walk away?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.800
I'm sorry, Dr Jackson.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.280
This is how it must be.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.880
Hiya, kid.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.760
You were asleep for a long time.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.600
You gave me quite a scare.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.240
Sorry.

39:47.920 --> 39:51.040
Jack told me what happened.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.320
I'm proud of you.

39:55.680 --> 40:01.640
Look, Sam... I may not be able to come
around as much for the next little while.

40:02.920 --> 40:07.000
- What do you mean?
- Things kind of got screwed up.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.400
The alliance is in trouble.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.160
- I don't understand.
- You don't need to know the details.

40:14.240 --> 40:18.840
Let's just say we're going
our separate ways for a while.

40:19.800 --> 40:24.840
If I stay with the Tok'ra,
I can at least try to mend some fences.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.880
Are you sure?

40:28.960 --> 40:32.080
I'm not ready to give up on this just yet.

40:40.680 --> 40:43.840
Don't worry, I'll be back eventually.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.040
I'll miss you.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.360
I'll miss you, too.

41:24.120 --> 41:28.480
