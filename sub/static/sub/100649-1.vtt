01:33.021 --> 01:35.355
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:35.357 --> 01:37.089
Okay. Oh, come on.

01:37.091 --> 01:38.924
Come on, open.

01:40.795 --> 01:42.061
No. Shit. Shit!

01:42.063 --> 01:43.929
Oh, God.

01:50.071 --> 01:51.103
Okay.

02:09.857 --> 02:12.124
A memorial
service for Kurt Cobain

02:12.126 --> 02:14.960
was held today in Seattle,
two days

02:14.962 --> 02:17.797
after the musician was found
dead of an apparent suicide.

02:20.735 --> 02:23.403
That's not how
fancy nannies dress.

02:23.405 --> 02:24.837
Come on, I'll take them.

02:24.839 --> 02:26.906
I'm a private tutor.

02:26.908 --> 02:28.174
Okay.

02:28.176 --> 02:30.743
Least you could do,

02:30.745 --> 02:32.078
leaving me without a roommate.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.080
I'm sorry for the short notice.

02:34.082 --> 02:35.881
They-they need me tomorrow.

02:35.883 --> 02:36.916
What about your class?

02:36.918 --> 02:38.717
I thought you love those kids.

02:38.719 --> 02:39.985
I do, but...

02:39.987 --> 02:42.721
the school's the one
that put me up for it.

02:47.995 --> 02:51.730
Look, I couldn't say no, okay?

02:51.732 --> 02:54.200
A few years ago, this
little girl lost her parents.

02:54.202 --> 02:57.002
And then now
her nanny just abandoned her.

02:57.004 --> 02:59.138
So you're ditching me
for a seven-year-old.

02:59.140 --> 03:03.209
You don't know what it's like
to grow up without parents.

03:03.211 --> 03:04.844
Okay.

03:04.846 --> 03:06.212
And I love teaching, but...

03:06.214 --> 03:10.151
I want to make a difference,
you know?

03:14.822 --> 03:17.091
So, you taking those with you?

03:18.292 --> 03:21.461
No.

03:21.463 --> 03:23.162
I think I'm kind of...
looking forward

03:23.164 --> 03:24.997
to having a little break
from these.

03:24.999 --> 03:27.233
She's been having
a bad spell lately.

03:27.235 --> 03:30.171
But I'm gonna go see her
tomorrow and say goodbye.

03:35.776 --> 03:38.210
Here.

03:38.212 --> 03:39.945
Are you gonna be okay
when you're up there?

03:39.947 --> 03:41.046
My God.

03:41.048 --> 03:42.948
I'm going
from 25 screaming kids

03:42.950 --> 03:44.717
to one little girl.

03:44.719 --> 03:47.052

Hi, Mom.

04:26.528 --> 04:27.895
What are you working on?

04:31.966 --> 04:33.799
Hey, what if I help you
move your stuff back

04:33.801 --> 04:34.735
into the art room?

04:41.108 --> 04:43.976
So...

04:43.978 --> 04:46.011
I'm leaving today.

04:46.013 --> 04:49.014
For the... the new job.

04:49.016 --> 04:50.883
You remember? I told you
about that little girl,

04:50.885 --> 04:53.285
all alone with her housekeeper.

04:53.287 --> 04:55.287
Little girl?

04:55.289 --> 04:56.857
All on her own?

04:57.959 --> 04:59.858
Yeah.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.894
Well, that's
a big responsibility.

05:01.896 --> 05:03.896
I know.

05:03.898 --> 05:06.399
I can handle it.

05:08.403 --> 05:11.003
You look...

05:11.005 --> 05:12.740
nice.

05:13.808 --> 05:15.307
Thank you.

05:15.309 --> 05:17.142
Here. Take this.

05:17.144 --> 05:18.811
It'll keep you warm.

05:33.094 --> 05:34.893
Okay.

05:40.301 --> 05:42.770
Love you.

06:45.266 --> 06:48.102
This can't be real.

08:37.278 --> 08:40.380
Flora leaves
her toys everywhere.

08:40.381 --> 08:42.114
Don't be surprised if you find

08:42.116 --> 08:44.784
a Little Mermaid
in your toilet.

08:46.354 --> 08:48.086
You must be Kate.

08:48.088 --> 08:50.055
Yes. Hi.

08:50.057 --> 08:52.358
Come along.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.495
Oh.

08:54.563 --> 08:56.463
Are you Mrs. Grose?

08:56.465 --> 08:58.096
I am.

08:58.098 --> 09:01.268
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

09:08.343 --> 09:10.175
And it's just the two
of you here?

09:10.177 --> 09:13.379
Cleaners and the gardener
come in every couple of weeks.

09:13.381 --> 09:15.113
But, yes, it's just me

09:15.115 --> 09:18.150
and Flora
while Miles is away at school.

09:18.152 --> 09:21.989
And this is where you'll
give Flora her lessons.

09:23.290 --> 09:26.058
Have you ever been
a live-in governess?

09:26.060 --> 09:28.060
No, no, not since the 1800s.

09:29.063 --> 09:31.364
Is that a joke?

09:31.366 --> 09:34.134
No, no, not a funny one.

09:35.236 --> 09:37.337
This is my first live-in job.

09:37.339 --> 09:38.671
Ah.

09:38.673 --> 09:40.573
Well, I hope
you know what you're doing.

09:40.575 --> 09:45.310
The children are
very special, Kate.

09:45.312 --> 09:47.447
They're thoroughbreds.

09:47.449 --> 09:49.449
Now, come along.

09:49.451 --> 09:52.253
I have something on the stove.

09:53.455 --> 09:55.320
It's so quiet.

09:55.322 --> 09:57.322
All the better to hear you
when you get lost.

09:57.324 --> 09:58.858
Is that a joke?

09:58.860 --> 10:00.428
No.

10:03.465 --> 10:04.464
Mmm.

10:04.466 --> 10:06.466
That smells so good.

10:06.468 --> 10:09.167
I made this soup
for Flora's father

10:09.169 --> 10:10.436
when he was her age.

10:10.438 --> 10:13.105
Oh, you've been with the family
for that long?

10:13.107 --> 10:14.576
- That's quite a commitment.
- It's an honor...

10:16.110 --> 10:18.446
...is what it is.

10:21.516 --> 10:24.651
And may I ask
how the parents died?

10:24.653 --> 10:27.453
They died
in a tragic car accident,

10:27.455 --> 10:29.321
just outside the gate.

10:29.323 --> 10:32.157
Flora saw the whole thing.

10:32.159 --> 10:33.595
- That's awful.
- Yes, it is.

10:34.696 --> 10:37.298
And it's hard for the children.

10:38.366 --> 10:39.532
Well,

10:39.534 --> 10:42.200
growing up
without parents is...

10:43.905 --> 10:46.472
My father left
when I was Flora's age,

10:46.474 --> 10:47.609
so...

10:49.477 --> 10:51.413
Is that right?

10:52.480 --> 10:54.349
Mmm.

10:56.685 --> 10:58.317
I'd love to meet Flora.

10:58.319 --> 11:00.420
Where might I find her?

11:00.422 --> 11:02.422
She's down at the stables.

11:02.424 --> 11:06.359
Just take the path
around the back.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.696
Ah.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.497
Uh, may I?

11:11.499 --> 11:13.535
Of course.

11:33.788 --> 11:36.524
Flora?

12:01.349 --> 12:02.982
Flora?

12:05.453 --> 12:06.719
It's Kate.

12:06.721 --> 12:09.189
I came to say hi.

12:32.414 --> 12:33.615
Flora?

12:42.256 --> 12:43.491
Flora?

13:04.446 --> 13:05.611
Hi.

13:07.382 --> 13:08.381
Hi.

13:08.383 --> 13:09.582
Where were you hiding?

13:09.584 --> 13:11.651
Like I'd tell.

13:13.421 --> 13:15.621
Geez. He's not very friendly, is he?

13:15.623 --> 13:16.856
His name's Samson.

13:16.858 --> 13:19.291
He's grumpy <i>all</i> the time.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.061
He only lets Miles ride him.

13:22.063 --> 13:24.330
Ah. Ooh.

13:24.332 --> 13:25.865
And who's this?

13:25.867 --> 13:27.633
This is Delilah.

13:27.635 --> 13:30.603
She was my mother's horse.

13:30.605 --> 13:33.740
You can pet her on the nose
if you want.

13:33.742 --> 13:35.307
Just be gentle, okay?

13:36.911 --> 13:38.678
She wants your apple.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.316
How did you know that?

13:48.490 --> 13:50.723
She is my favorite horse.

13:50.725 --> 13:53.726
Did you know that apples
have cyanide in them?

13:53.728 --> 13:56.329
And the seeds are poisonous.

13:56.331 --> 13:58.931
No, I did not know that.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.833
How did you know that?

14:00.835 --> 14:03.536
She told me.

14:03.538 --> 14:07.673
Dr. Felicity Peppercorn
Clock Watch.

14:07.675 --> 14:09.675
Oh.
Nice to meet you, Felicity.

14:09.677 --> 14:11.511
That's quite a name.

14:11.513 --> 14:13.479
She's a veterinarian.

14:13.481 --> 14:14.814
Is that what you want to be?

14:14.816 --> 14:16.582
Or maybe a chef.

14:16.584 --> 14:17.750
- You could be both.
- I would have

14:17.752 --> 14:19.886
to be a vegetarian.

14:19.888 --> 14:21.587
- Why is that?
- I can't save animals,

14:21.589 --> 14:23.356
then eat them.

14:23.358 --> 14:24.957
Very true.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.693
Come on.

14:27.695 --> 14:30.129
Hold on.

14:30.131 --> 14:31.597
Wow.

14:31.599 --> 14:33.933
This maze is very complicated.

14:33.935 --> 14:36.602
Yeah. It's so big.

14:36.604 --> 14:38.671
You need to know
your way around,

14:38.673 --> 14:41.674
or you'll get lost.

14:41.676 --> 14:44.410
One time, I couldn't find
my way out,

14:44.412 --> 14:46.445
and I almost starved to death.

14:46.447 --> 14:48.414
What?

14:48.416 --> 14:51.551
Geez, your friends
must love it here.

14:51.553 --> 14:54.754
I don't have any friends.

14:54.756 --> 14:56.656
You have no friends?

14:56.658 --> 14:58.457
Nope.

14:58.459 --> 15:00.660
Well, you might have one now.

15:00.662 --> 15:02.461
- Maybe.
- "Maybe."

15:02.463 --> 15:05.598
Okay. I'll work for it.

15:07.869 --> 15:10.703
Okay. So, what,
you're in ninth grade? Tenth?

15:10.705 --> 15:12.405
- Second.
- Second?

15:12.407 --> 15:14.740
- Wow.
- I could've skipped a grade if I wanted.

15:14.742 --> 15:17.743
Miss Jessel said
I was an exceptional student.

15:17.745 --> 15:20.012
Wait, who's Miss Jessel?

15:20.014 --> 15:22.515
My teacher before you.

15:22.517 --> 15:24.016
She taught me French, you know.

15:24.018 --> 15:25.618
She did?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.753
Come on, slowpoke.

15:27.755 --> 15:31.190
And this mirror's
from the 1980s.

15:31.192 --> 15:33.192
- Ooh.
- That's my great-

15:33.194 --> 15:36.696
great-great-great-aunt
Louisiana and her dog Otis.

15:36.698 --> 15:40.766
And that's the ship
her brother died on.

15:40.768 --> 15:41.870
Guess what he had.

15:43.738 --> 15:45.972
He had dentistry.

15:45.974 --> 15:48.207
Dysentery?

15:48.209 --> 15:50.910
Yeah, that's what I said.

15:54.983 --> 15:56.883
That's Miles' room.

15:56.885 --> 15:59.752
And that's mine, next to it.

16:00.788 --> 16:02.924
Wait, wait.
What's down there?

16:05.593 --> 16:07.693
That's the east wing.

16:07.695 --> 16:10.663
I don't go
in that part of the house.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.864
Why not?

16:11.866 --> 16:13.868
Don't wanna.

16:24.512 --> 16:26.512
This is your room.

16:26.514 --> 16:28.514
I hope you like the bedding.

16:28.516 --> 16:29.782
This is my room?

16:29.784 --> 16:30.883
Yep.

16:30.885 --> 16:32.551
Wow.

16:32.553 --> 16:33.886
This is all for me?

16:33.888 --> 16:34.987
Yep.

16:34.989 --> 16:36.522
Oh.

16:36.524 --> 16:38.557
This is my great-grandmother
Sophie.

16:38.559 --> 16:39.825
You stuffed your grandma?

16:39.827 --> 16:41.827
No, silly head.

16:41.829 --> 16:43.896
It's just supposed
to look like her.

16:43.898 --> 16:44.997
Oh, I see.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.832
Well, she's, uh...

16:46.834 --> 16:48.968
she's creepy, huh?

16:48.970 --> 16:50.036
I think she's pretty.

16:50.038 --> 16:52.038
Do you want
to see something else?

16:52.040 --> 16:53.973
Yeah.

16:53.975 --> 16:56.709
Behold!

16:56.711 --> 17:00.581
My great-grandmother's
sewing room.

17:04.819 --> 17:07.987
My mother used to take me
shopping when I was little.

17:07.989 --> 17:09.888
But after she died,

17:09.891 --> 17:13.125
Miss Jessel started making
all of my clothes for me.

17:13.127 --> 17:15.795
Well, that one's beautiful.

17:15.797 --> 17:19.565
Miss Jessel never got to finish
this one before she left.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.133
It was for my birthday.

17:21.135 --> 17:24.069
♪ Hello...! ♪

17:24.071 --> 17:25.738
♪ I am ♪

17:25.740 --> 17:27.573
♪ A mannequin. ♪

17:29.544 --> 17:31.143
Hmm.

17:31.145 --> 17:33.715
What is this?

17:35.016 --> 17:36.916
Um... yeah.

17:36.918 --> 17:38.751
Miles did that.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.055
I told him it was tacky.

17:42.724 --> 17:44.857
Yikes.

17:44.859 --> 17:47.093
Now, eat it all up.

17:48.997 --> 17:49.962
- Oh.
- I have an idea.

17:49.964 --> 17:53.666
What if you and I took
a little field trip

17:53.668 --> 17:55.968
to go get some ice cream
before class started tomorrow?

17:55.970 --> 17:57.770
Uh, no.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.339
Flora doesn't leave
the property.

17:59.341 --> 18:00.906
She has everything
she needs here.

18:00.908 --> 18:02.775
What?

18:02.777 --> 18:03.843
Don't you, darling?

18:03.845 --> 18:06.979
She prefers
my French apple tart,

18:06.981 --> 18:09.181
with a little bit of cream
on the side.

18:09.183 --> 18:10.950
And you don't have
to go anywhere for that.

18:10.952 --> 18:12.352
Do you, darling?

18:12.354 --> 18:15.623
No.

18:53.895 --> 18:55.961
You're gonna leave me,
aren't you?

18:55.963 --> 18:58.699
What are you talking about?

19:00.768 --> 19:03.235
Miss Jessel left
without saying goodbye.

19:03.237 --> 19:06.707
And now she won't talk
to me anymore.

19:07.809 --> 19:09.975
You know,

19:09.977 --> 19:13.181
some people have a really
hard time saying goodbye.

19:14.715 --> 19:16.682
But I bet she did it the way

19:16.684 --> 19:18.851
she thought would be best
for both of you.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.822
Well, it's not easy for me.

19:24.158 --> 19:26.127
Let's get you to bed.

19:33.101 --> 19:34.733
Mm.

19:34.735 --> 19:36.836
Okay.

19:36.838 --> 19:38.671
Tucked in?

19:41.175 --> 19:44.043
- I like you.
- I like you.

19:44.045 --> 19:46.212
And I'm not going anywhere.

19:46.214 --> 19:48.948
Promise, promise?

19:48.950 --> 19:51.050
Cross my heart and hope to die.

19:51.052 --> 19:52.885
Stick a needle in your eye?

19:52.887 --> 19:54.787
Mm. No. No, no.

19:54.789 --> 19:56.922
Maybe not that part.

19:59.727 --> 20:01.927

25:30.157 --> 25:32.459

25:32.461 --> 25:34.360

We met.

27:24.506 --> 27:26.606
I'm really sorry about
last night. Uh, I didn't...

27:26.608 --> 27:28.474
I didn't mean
to be rude or anything.

27:28.476 --> 27:30.376
Sorry if I scared you.

27:30.378 --> 27:32.478
Oh, it's fine.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.247
Cool.

27:35.249 --> 27:37.350
So, seems like
you had a rough night.

27:37.352 --> 27:39.217
You're a sleepwalker,
like Flora.

27:39.219 --> 27:41.186
- I don't sleepwalk.
- How would you know, silly?

27:41.188 --> 27:44.156
You're asleep the whole time.

27:44.158 --> 27:45.525
I just know.

27:45.527 --> 27:48.361
- That's a cool sweater.
- Thanks.

27:48.363 --> 27:50.195
You shouldn't be wearing that.

27:50.197 --> 27:51.531
He wanted me to have it.

27:51.533 --> 27:54.232
- Was it your dad's?
- It was Quint's.

27:54.234 --> 27:57.370
- Who's Quint?
- He was the riding instructor.

27:57.372 --> 27:58.638
He managed the estate.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.272
He was the best.

28:00.274 --> 28:01.676
Oh, and he's not here anymore?

28:02.777 --> 28:04.644
He died.

28:04.646 --> 28:06.412
Oh.

28:06.414 --> 28:08.548
Everyone dies, Miles.

28:14.456 --> 28:16.689
So, do you ride horses?

28:16.691 --> 28:19.459
Oh. Uh, well, I rode a couple
times at summer camp.

28:19.461 --> 28:20.960
Hello. Fairchild residence.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.228
But that's a lie.
I just stayed on the horse.

28:25.232 --> 28:27.265
- I can teach you if you want.
- Yeah?

28:27.267 --> 28:29.535
- Who?
- I mean, if you can handle it.

28:29.537 --> 28:31.303
Oh, is that a challenge?

28:31.305 --> 28:32.672
Yeah.

28:32.674 --> 28:34.540
Uh, no, I think
I can handle it.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.241
- Please hold.
- Yeah, I'm a...

28:36.243 --> 28:38.444
- I'm a quick learner.
- Kate!

28:38.446 --> 28:41.414
It's the headmaster
at Miles' school.

28:41.416 --> 28:45.283
He would like to speak with
the person in charge of us.

28:45.285 --> 28:46.552
Uh...

28:46.554 --> 28:48.456
Yes, fine.

28:49.557 --> 28:51.493
Better take that.

28:57.297 --> 28:59.297
Hello. This is Kate.

28:59.299 --> 29:02.702
So, Miss Flora, are you
forgetting your breakfast?

29:02.704 --> 29:04.570
- Uh, I...
- Yes?

29:04.572 --> 29:06.306
Well, let me cut it up for you.

29:12.781 --> 29:14.312
Okay.

29:14.314 --> 29:16.649
Um, thank you
for letting us know.

29:28.830 --> 29:31.431
So, what did old,

29:31.433 --> 29:32.801
uh, fragile Farty want?

29:36.337 --> 29:38.473
He, um...

29:41.443 --> 29:45.277
He gave me a list
of some of your schoolwork

29:45.279 --> 29:47.214
to complete while you're home.

29:48.483 --> 29:50.483
Okay.

29:50.485 --> 29:52.487
That sounds fun.

29:54.723 --> 29:56.522
Great.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.326
Where are you going?

30:00.328 --> 30:02.628
To my room.

30:02.630 --> 30:03.896
What about your plate?

30:03.898 --> 30:06.599
- What?
- Your plate.

30:06.601 --> 30:08.534
Aren't you gonna take it
to the kitchen?

30:08.536 --> 30:11.571
Want me to cut the grass, too?

30:11.573 --> 30:13.406
No.

30:13.408 --> 30:15.475
But Mrs. Grose prepared
a beautiful breakfast for us,

30:15.477 --> 30:17.510
and it would be
the polite thing to do.

30:17.512 --> 30:19.779
That's her job, right?

30:19.781 --> 30:21.881
- Miles.
- It's fine, Miles.

30:21.883 --> 30:23.516
I'll do it, darling.

30:23.518 --> 30:25.485
You go on ahead.

30:25.487 --> 30:27.854
Come on, Flora.

30:27.856 --> 30:30.423
Let's go.

30:30.425 --> 30:32.393
It's not your job either,
Flora.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.801
They were born
into privilege, Kate.

30:41.803 --> 30:43.836
Can you please remember that?

30:43.838 --> 30:46.541
Miles was expelled.

30:48.743 --> 30:50.710
He attacked another student.

30:50.712 --> 30:52.678
He what?

30:52.680 --> 30:54.680
Yes, apparently
a teacher found him

30:54.682 --> 30:58.484
with his hands around
another boy's neck, slamming

30:58.486 --> 30:59.919
his head
into the bathroom tile.

30:59.921 --> 31:03.689
Oh, absolutely not.

31:03.691 --> 31:06.726
No, he wouldn't do that.

31:06.728 --> 31:09.829
He did, and it sounds
like he's very lucky

31:09.831 --> 31:12.433
that the other boy's family
isn't pressing charges.

31:13.501 --> 31:15.635
Yes, well, other boys, Kate,

31:15.637 --> 31:17.705
have always been jealous
of Miles.

31:20.575 --> 31:23.444
- Here, let me help you.
- No, thank you.

31:24.579 --> 31:26.548
This is my job.

31:27.582 --> 31:29.551
You do yours.

31:51.606 --> 31:53.873
And what's that lava

31:53.875 --> 31:57.443
that sits
in the volcano called?

31:57.445 --> 31:59.879
Um... it's magma.

31:59.881 --> 32:02.415
Mm. Yeah. Ouch.

32:02.417 --> 32:04.953
It is "ouch." Super hot.

32:13.995 --> 32:15.995
Flora?

32:15.997 --> 32:17.730
Yeah?

32:17.732 --> 32:20.466
Does Miles get
in trouble a lot?

32:21.870 --> 32:24.570
Miles is the best.

32:36.951 --> 32:38.951
Stop it!

32:38.953 --> 32:41.721
Thank you.

32:41.723 --> 32:43.691
Flora, back to work.

33:18.927 --> 33:21.060
Miles?

33:21.062 --> 33:22.929
Don't you know how to knock?

33:22.931 --> 33:26.532
Do you have a friend in here?

33:26.534 --> 33:28.803
What do you want?

33:30.772 --> 33:33.673
Sorry. I thought
I saw someone...

33:33.675 --> 33:35.677
come in here.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.588
There's no one in here.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.059
It's just you and me.

34:13.014 --> 34:15.547
Okay.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.683
I think we...

34:17.685 --> 34:19.053
got off on the wrong foot.

34:20.154 --> 34:22.154
You're new.

34:22.156 --> 34:24.092
I accept your apology.

34:51.119 --> 34:53.786
It's interesting.

34:53.788 --> 34:55.721
Yeah, she's just...

34:55.723 --> 34:57.056
Well, there's two of them.

34:57.058 --> 34:59.725
Oh. I thought
it was just the little girl.

34:59.727 --> 35:03.195
So did I, but the brother
is back from boarding school,

35:03.197 --> 35:05.197
and I think he hates me.

35:05.199 --> 35:07.066
I knew it sounded

35:07.068 --> 35:08.868
too good to be true.

35:08.870 --> 35:10.736
Still happy you went?

35:10.738 --> 35:12.038
Oh, yeah.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.206
Sorry. It's great.

35:14.208 --> 35:15.875
So focus on the positives.

35:15.877 --> 35:17.777
Don't let this kid
get under your skin.

35:17.779 --> 35:20.046
Working on it.

35:20.048 --> 35:21.814
Tell me about the house now.

35:21.816 --> 35:23.849
Are there, like,
creepy suits of armor

35:23.851 --> 35:25.718
or paintings with eyes cut out?

35:25.720 --> 35:27.720
Or a crypt in the basement?

35:30.091 --> 35:32.091
Yeah.

35:32.093 --> 35:34.093
Hello?

35:34.095 --> 35:36.162
Kate?

35:36.164 --> 35:38.130
You're not listening to me.

35:38.132 --> 35:39.832
No, I am listening.

35:39.834 --> 35:41.233
Help!

35:41.235 --> 35:43.836
So, remember that guy Tanner?

35:43.838 --> 35:45.971
We went to that bar
on 14th a few weeks ago.

35:45.973 --> 35:47.706
Well, he finally
called me back,

35:47.708 --> 35:50.178
but, but now I don't even think
it's worth it, so, um...

35:52.080 --> 35:54.949
Oh, my God.
I got to go.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.988
No!

36:59.947 --> 37:01.213
We got you. We got you.

37:01.215 --> 37:03.749
We got you. We got you.

37:03.751 --> 37:05.184
What?

37:13.928 --> 37:17.098
Both of you in the house now!

37:33.047 --> 37:35.181
What on earth happened to you?

37:35.183 --> 37:37.917
Ask the thoroughbreds.

39:21.055 --> 39:22.455
What?

39:22.457 --> 39:25.124
What are you doing?

39:25.126 --> 39:27.329
There was a spider on you.

39:34.336 --> 39:36.871
It was crawling up
towards your face.

39:40.941 --> 39:43.909
When my door is closed,
I'd like you to knock.

39:43.911 --> 39:46.011
Your light was on.

39:46.013 --> 39:48.914
I thought you'd be awake.

39:48.916 --> 39:50.217
You're scared of the dark?

40:01.162 --> 40:02.331
I'm sorry.

40:05.066 --> 40:08.002
I haven't made
the best impression, have I?

40:09.937 --> 40:11.872
To be honest, you haven't.

40:15.109 --> 40:17.142
Miles.

40:17.144 --> 40:19.512
What happened at school?

40:19.514 --> 40:23.117
Why did you hurt that boy?

40:25.354 --> 40:29.088
He burned... every one

40:29.090 --> 40:31.926
of the pictures
my father sent me.

40:34.095 --> 40:36.997
I miss him.

40:46.508 --> 40:48.443
You need to go to bed.

41:03.157 --> 41:06.026
Can I still give you
your riding lesson tomorrow?

41:08.162 --> 41:09.930
Sure.

41:54.308 --> 41:56.074
Head up.
Thighs against the horse.

41:56.076 --> 41:58.177
Sit in the center
of the saddle.

41:58.179 --> 41:59.379
You'll get better balance.

42:01.349 --> 42:03.583
Ride harder. Put your thumb
on the top of your reins,

42:03.585 --> 42:05.552
and your pinkie on the bottom.

42:05.554 --> 42:07.353
- Don't let her get the bit.
- Okay, I'm not.

42:09.491 --> 42:12.090
Rein her in hard.

42:16.130 --> 42:17.365
Well done.

42:19.166 --> 42:21.099
You didn't have
to keep whipping her.

42:21.101 --> 42:23.268
Yes, I did.

42:23.270 --> 42:25.438
You wanted to learn.
That's how Quint taught me.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.340
It's a strong animal.

42:27.342 --> 42:28.641
If you don't exert
power over it,

42:28.643 --> 42:31.377
then you'll never gain control.

42:34.315 --> 42:36.048
You look good up there.

42:36.050 --> 42:38.050
Miles.

42:38.052 --> 42:40.520
I'm bored.
Can we do something else now?

42:40.522 --> 42:42.154
What do you want to do?

42:42.156 --> 42:44.256
Can we show Kate the koi pond?

42:44.258 --> 42:46.426
It's Flora's favorite part
of the garden.

42:46.428 --> 42:47.529
Let's check it out.

43:15.457 --> 43:17.189
Look.

43:17.191 --> 43:20.158
That koi is, like,
bumping into the wall.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.861
Like, ga-dah.

43:24.298 --> 43:25.565
Okay.

43:25.567 --> 43:27.199
She's trying to make
her great escape.

43:27.201 --> 43:28.468
Maybe she wants to be
a flying fish.

43:28.470 --> 43:30.037
Make a wish upon the rock.

43:31.606 --> 43:33.439
I wish this...

43:34.643 --> 43:36.543
25 years.

43:36.545 --> 43:38.110
What if you lived

43:38.112 --> 43:40.178

43:51.560 --> 43:55.062

Miles.

44:01.403 --> 44:03.505

44:09.411 --> 44:10.645
Nothing should have to suffer.

44:12.714 --> 44:15.182
That was my favorite fish.

44:16.317 --> 44:18.553
Now you've seen the koi pond.

44:36.504 --> 44:39.271
Ah, I love this tea party.

44:39.273 --> 44:40.540
Me, too.

44:40.542 --> 44:43.610
Hey, don't drink out of my cup.

Miles.

45:59.788 --> 46:02.322
Flora.

46:04.392 --> 46:07.328
Just checking
you were still here.

46:11.666 --> 46:14.500
Still here.

46:22.477 --> 46:26.045
Miles' effects from his school
arrived this morning.

46:26.047 --> 46:28.315
Oh.

46:34.756 --> 46:36.756
- Mrs. Grose.
- What?

46:36.758 --> 46:38.391
Do you ever hear...?

46:40.294 --> 46:41.394
I'm gonna get you.

46:41.396 --> 46:42.495
I'm gonna get you.
You're it!

46:42.497 --> 46:43.796
Guys, it's very early.

46:43.798 --> 46:46.065
- Can you stop? You guys.
- Children,

46:46.067 --> 46:47.633
can you listen to Kate?

46:47.635 --> 46:49.569
Listen to Kate, please.

46:51.473 --> 46:52.774
You need to take charge here,
Kate.

46:58.346 --> 47:00.247
Bad dreams?

47:10.324 --> 47:11.524
I have an idea.

47:11.526 --> 47:14.093
Since it's Saturday,
why don't we go

47:14.095 --> 47:16.462
into Millbrook
and get a new koi?

47:16.464 --> 47:17.732
Hmm?

47:18.867 --> 47:21.100
Yeah.

47:23.104 --> 47:24.604
I don't want to.

47:24.606 --> 47:25.671
Come on, it'll be fun.

47:25.673 --> 47:28.476
You know that Flora
doesn't leave the property.

47:29.744 --> 47:31.780
You don't have to go, darling.

47:38.419 --> 47:40.520
What if I asked
my special friend, huh?

47:40.522 --> 47:42.490
Want me to try?

47:44.659 --> 47:46.761
Will you keep me
and Flora safe?

47:49.631 --> 47:51.397
You will?

47:51.399 --> 47:53.568
- And Kate, too?
- And Kate, too?

47:54.636 --> 47:57.770
Really?

47:57.772 --> 48:00.675
He says you have nothing
to worry about.

48:04.412 --> 48:06.648
Okay.
So, go get your coat.

48:10.785 --> 48:12.685
Good job, Miles.

48:12.687 --> 48:14.622
He also thinks
your tattoo is sexy.

I'm sorry that I didn't stop
when you first asked me.

53:47.755 --> 53:50.224
It's really not nice
not to be listened to.

53:54.962 --> 53:57.129
Have you ever heard
of a brave face?

53:57.131 --> 53:59.131
Hmm?

53:59.133 --> 54:00.733
I'm actually wearing mine
right now.

54:00.735 --> 54:01.903
Can you see it?

54:04.939 --> 54:06.906
I don't see anything.

54:06.908 --> 54:08.040
That's good.

54:08.042 --> 54:09.141
Because it's invisible.

54:09.143 --> 54:11.110
So if you saw something,
it would mean it was broken.

54:11.112 --> 54:13.145
My mom showed me
how to make one,

54:13.147 --> 54:14.280
so I can do it for you
if you want.

54:14.282 --> 54:15.814
I've actually been wearing mine

54:15.816 --> 54:18.017

than you.

54:18.019 --> 54:20.353
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:20.355 --> 54:21.822
What do you think?
Should we try?

54:23.257 --> 54:25.824
I just have to...

54:25.826 --> 54:28.361
do a quick scan of your face
to make it first, okay?

54:28.363 --> 54:30.129
Blow.

54:30.131 --> 54:31.964

54:34.802 --> 54:36.235

54:37.539 --> 54:39.104
- a good face for it, yeah.
- Yeah.

54:39.106 --> 54:40.940
So I'm gonna get all of
my bravery and all of yours

54:40.942 --> 54:42.208

54:42.210 --> 54:45.112

to run away.

57:54.235 --> 57:56.403
Well, I gather
things went south with them.

57:56.405 --> 57:57.437
Why?

57:57.439 --> 57:59.204
Because he was a brute.

57:59.206 --> 58:01.140
When the parents died,

58:01.142 --> 58:03.275
he walked around this place
like he owned it.

58:03.277 --> 58:06.346
Even moved himself
into the master suite.

58:06.348 --> 58:08.383
He was disgusting.

58:10.317 --> 58:12.253
How did Quint die?

58:13.320 --> 58:16.188
He had an accident

58:16.190 --> 58:18.758
couple of weeks
after Miss Jessel left.

58:18.760 --> 58:21.126
Fell from his horse,

58:21.128 --> 58:22.395
drunk.

58:22.397 --> 58:26.334
Died in the dirt
like the animal that he was.

58:28.370 --> 58:30.370
How was he with Miles?

58:30.372 --> 58:34.106
Well, he was
a terrible influence.

58:34.108 --> 58:36.008
He used to take Miles

58:36.010 --> 58:39.011
and disappear with him
for hours.

58:39.013 --> 58:42.549
Miles was such a sweet boy.

58:42.551 --> 58:46.555
The Miles I've met
is not a sweet boy.

58:48.790 --> 58:52.259
Well, that is really no concern
of yours, is it, Kate?

58:53.361 --> 58:55.495
Then whose concern is it?

58:55.497 --> 58:58.433
I mean, it certainly doesn't
seem to be any of yours.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400
<i>Quint sat next to me at dinner,</i>

01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:42.468
<i>reeking of whiskey.</i>

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.470
<i>He won't leave me alone.</i>

01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:47.375
<i>Mrs. Grose
won't do anything to help.</i>

01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:51.744
<i>I have to sleep
with my door locked.</i>

01:00:51.746 --> 01:00:55.715
<i>Quint tried to come in
in the middle of the night.</i>

01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:59.151
<i>I can barely focus
on my lessons now.</i>

01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:02.655
<i>I feel Quint's eyes on me
all the time.</i>

01:01:02.657 --> 01:01:06.158
<i>I woke up to a photo
that Quint left on my bed.</i>

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.661
<i>I don't know how he got in.</i>

01:01:08.663 --> 01:01:11.229
<i>I'm not safe.</i>

01:01:11.231 --> 01:01:13.368
<i>I have to leave.</i>

01:01:44.966 --> 01:01:46.735
Miles, come back!

01:01:53.642 --> 01:01:56.442
Miles!
Talk to me!

01:02:00.715 --> 01:02:01.683
Miles!

01:02:10.725 --> 01:02:12.192
Wait!

01:02:45.727 --> 01:02:47.696
<i>Stop.</i>

01:02:51.366 --> 01:02:53.766
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

01:03:04.713 --> 01:03:06.612
Help me.

01:03:06.614 --> 01:03:10.383
Help me. Help me.

01:03:10.385 --> 01:03:13.352
Help me.

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:52.391
Flora.

01:03:52.393 --> 01:03:54.560
Can you paint at your desk,
please?

01:03:54.562 --> 01:03:56.395
I paint better over here.

01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:58.531
No, you're gonna get paint
all over the floor.

01:03:58.533 --> 01:04:01.667
Okay, fine.
I'm finished anyways.

01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:03.669
Want to see?

01:04:03.671 --> 01:04:05.406
Sure.

01:04:11.379 --> 01:04:13.412
What is this?

01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.517
Me and Miss Jessel.

01:04:25.827 --> 01:04:28.863
Can we play flashlight tag now?

01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:32.832
No.

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:35.635
But you promised.

01:04:35.637 --> 01:04:37.937
Yeah, Kate, you promised.

01:04:37.939 --> 01:04:41.741
You don't want
to let Flora down, do you?

01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:43.709
You promised.

01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.411
You promised. You promised.

01:04:45.413 --> 01:04:47.847
You promised.
You promised. You promised.

01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:49.715
- You promised. You promised. You promised.
- Okay.

01:04:49.717 --> 01:04:51.717
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- You promised.

01:04:51.719 --> 01:04:53.354
Just...

01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:58.958
- What are the rules?
- Turn off all the lights.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.693
You have to find us with this.

01:05:00.695 --> 01:05:02.795
If you flash us,

01:05:02.797 --> 01:05:03.996
we're dead.

01:05:03.998 --> 01:05:05.498
You're it.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
Call out the state capitals.

01:05:07.502 --> 01:05:08.868
No peeking.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.839
Come on, come on, come on!

01:05:13.575 --> 01:05:15.775
Alaska.

01:05:15.777 --> 01:05:18.010
Juneau.

01:05:18.012 --> 01:05:20.680
Arizona.

01:05:20.682 --> 01:05:22.617
Phoenix.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:50.269
Gotcha.

01:06:50.271 --> 01:06:51.570
I'm dead!

01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:54.006
I'm dead. Oh! I'm dead.

01:06:54.008 --> 01:06:55.975
Ah!

01:06:57.979 --> 01:07:00.982
Is Miles down there?

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.517
Maybe.

01:07:04.519 --> 01:07:05.952
You want to come with me
to find him?

01:07:05.954 --> 01:07:08.654
I can't. I'm dead.

01:08:01.809 --> 01:08:02.977
Miles!

01:08:06.047 --> 01:08:08.649
Okay, I don't want
to play anymore.

01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:21.252
Miles?

01:09:21.255 --> 01:09:23.823
Hmm. Can you make the moves?

01:09:23.825 --> 01:09:25.057
- No.
- No.

01:09:25.059 --> 01:09:26.792
Can I even play?

01:09:48.116 --> 01:09:51.152
Can you just... just stop!

01:10:02.096 --> 01:10:03.762
Stop it!

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.064
This isn't funny!

01:10:05.066 --> 01:10:07.933
You...

01:10:38.866 --> 01:10:41.033
- You!
- Kate.

01:10:41.035 --> 01:10:43.804
Oh, my God.
What happened to your face?

01:10:50.878 --> 01:10:52.945
Explain yourself.

01:10:52.947 --> 01:10:55.814
I was hungry?

01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:58.050
I am sick of the games!

01:10:58.052 --> 01:10:59.985
Don't talk to them like that.

01:10:59.987 --> 01:11:02.054
He has been terrorizing me

01:11:02.056 --> 01:11:03.889
since day one!

01:11:03.891 --> 01:11:05.224
Don't be ridiculous.

01:11:05.226 --> 01:11:08.328
He's been here with me
for the last 15 minutes.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.196
The only person
doing the terrorizing

01:11:10.198 --> 01:11:11.299
round here is you.

01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:18.739
Now what are you doing?

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:50.264
Yeah.

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:39.408
Bad dreams?

01:14:42.243 --> 01:14:44.411
I'm gonna sleep with you, okay?

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:52.017
Come on.

01:15:39.066 --> 01:15:41.101
This came for you.

01:15:51.145 --> 01:15:52.514
Did you open my mail?

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:56.384
It came like that.

01:15:58.285 --> 01:16:00.589
Who is Darla?

01:16:02.056 --> 01:16:03.523
My mother.

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:05.125
Oh, I see.

01:16:07.094 --> 01:16:09.464
Well, we can't choose
our family.

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:34.021
Whatever your mother has,
let's hope it's not genetic.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.457
Yeah?

01:17:11.459 --> 01:17:13.326
Kate...

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:15.227
I need you.

01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:17.363
Mom?

01:17:17.365 --> 01:17:19.332
Oh.

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.901
Uh, I can't talk right now.

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:24.437
They're gonna throw me out.

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.738
What?

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.340
Uh, Mom.

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:31.377
I think I'm seeing things.

01:17:31.379 --> 01:17:33.615
Did you look at the drawings?

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:36.451
Yeah.

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.690
- Darla.
- Mom?

01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:44.492
Mom!

01:19:04.271 --> 01:19:05.373
Kate.

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:09.804
Flora?

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:12.574
Flora?

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.344
Miles?

01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:23.483
You're gonna wake the children.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.851
The children are asleep.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:27.520
I said you need to leave now.

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.691
Let me go, let me go.

01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:31.924
No, stop.

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.564
Stop. No. No!

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:14.634
Yes.

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.536
Yes.

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:54.974
Oh, my God.

01:21:57.478 --> 01:22:00.548
Kate. Kate.

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.751
Kate.

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:07.486
It was him.

01:22:07.488 --> 01:22:08.855
It was Quint!

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:11.424
What are you talking about?

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.426
Quint murdered Jessel.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.894
I saw her body
in the bottom of the lake.

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.796
You stop now.

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:18.867
You stop telling tales.

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:22.871
You knew.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:29.942
You knew Quint killed Jessel.

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.010
Look.

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.645
Quint's dead.

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:34.582
I made sure of it.

01:22:38.519 --> 01:22:39.552
Where are the kids?

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:40.786
You stay away from them.

01:22:40.788 --> 01:22:43.789
They're not safe!

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:46.525
I should never have let you
in here in the first place.

01:22:46.527 --> 01:22:47.693
You knew.

01:22:47.695 --> 01:22:49.595
You knew.
You never did anything.

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:52.698
I've been protecting
this family for a lifetime,

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.934
and I won't let you near them.

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.903
'Cause you're mad, Kate.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.539
Move!

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.831
Flora!

01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:28.501
Oh, Flora. Oh...

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.802
Are you okay?

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:30.903
I'm scared.

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:34.573
Okay, do you still have
that brave face?

01:23:34.575 --> 01:23:37.011
I need you to put it on, okay?

01:23:40.748 --> 01:23:41.747
It's good?

01:23:41.749 --> 01:23:43.749
Okay, let's go.

01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:45.584
Where are we going?

01:23:47.855 --> 01:23:49.622
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:50.823
We just need to get to the car.

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.024
I don't want to die!

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.826
I don't want to leave!

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.961

01:26:25.447 --> 01:26:27.913
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on!

01:26:27.915 --> 01:26:28.950
Okay.

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:53.239
Whatever your mother has,

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:55.843
let's hope it's not genetic.

01:26:58.112 --> 01:27:01.182
I guess you can't escape
the inevitable.

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:20.966
No, stop it. I'm serious.

01:27:20.968 --> 01:27:22.801
You shouldn't be going
into her room.

01:27:22.803 --> 01:27:24.236
You have to trust me on this.

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:26.739
Shh. I can hear her.

01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:27.942
Play it cool.
She's coming.

01:27:30.011 --> 01:27:31.844
Miles, what's wrong with her?

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:34.081
She looks scary.

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:41.956
What are you guys
doing in here?

01:27:43.991 --> 01:27:45.758
I want to go.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.259
What's wrong?

01:27:47.261 --> 01:27:49.061
Shh.

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:50.064
Flora.

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:02.007
Flora.

01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:03.711
Flora?

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:08.348
Did you see Quint
in the mirror?

01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:09.882
I know that you saw him.

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.850
Yes, you did.
I saw you.

01:28:11.852 --> 01:28:13.854
Quint's dead.

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:16.855
You saw him, too.

01:28:16.857 --> 01:28:18.958
No, I didn't.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.992
Why are you lying to me?

01:28:19.994 --> 01:28:21.293
I saw him.
I know you saw him.

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:22.562
I didn't see him!

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:24.230
Just tell me that you saw him!

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.799
Flora, tell me you saw...

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:30.202
You broke her!

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.304
- She's broken. You broke her!
- I can,

01:28:32.306 --> 01:28:34.039
I can fix her.
Just let me...

01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.975
No, you can't!
You broke her!

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.142
- Flora, it was an accident.
- You broke her!

01:28:37.144 --> 01:28:39.278
You can't fix it.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.013
She's broken.

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:43.751
Just like you.

01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:50.124
Come on, Flora.

01:29:05.172 --> 01:29:07.340
Why is Kate crazy?

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:10.909
I don't know.

01:29:10.911 --> 01:29:12.011
<i>Well,
that's a big responsibility.</i>

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:14.179
<i>Miss Jessel left
without saying goodbye.</i>

01:29:14.181 --> 01:29:16.115
<i>- It was Quint.</i>
<i>- I know what you're afraid of.</i>

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.450
<i>You need to
take charge here, Kate.</i>

01:29:17.452 --> 01:29:18.652
<i>Just checking
you were still here.</i>

01:29:18.654 --> 01:29:20.019
<i>You're not our mother,
you're not our family.</i>

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.153
- <i>Stop pretending to be.</i>
<i>- He's been terrorizing me</i>

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:23.456
- <i>since day one.</i>
<i>- The only person</i>

01:29:23.458 --> 01:29:25.926
<i>doing the terroizing
round here is you.</i>

01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:07.231
