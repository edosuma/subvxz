[Slow Hip-Hop Beat]

00:04.972 --> 00:08.742
[Jimmy] I really don't
appreciate your arrogance
in that class.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.745
Ain't enough room for the two
of us in there
and you know it!

00:11.779 --> 00:14.282
Yo Omar, just say the word man.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.651
Say the word.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.289
I heard you have a court order
to attend Jane's class, Jimmy.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.825
And if they find out
you're drinking, it could
land you back in jail.

00:26.494 --> 00:27.661
Am I right?

00:28.496 --> 00:29.463
You wouldn't.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.998
I have Jane's number
on speed dial.

00:31.999 --> 00:35.469
So why don't you just take care
of my tab, and walk away.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.674
Fine.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.685
278 bucks?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.354
- We good for that.
- Yeah, we good for that.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.356
You got to be kidding me!

00:55.389 --> 00:57.325
Just make sure you leave a tip,
Jimmy.

01:00.594 --> 01:01.429
Thanks.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.441
You got any money?

01:13.974 --> 01:14.742
You?

01:15.476 --> 01:16.577
Worthless.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.114
You uh, take Bitcoin?

01:20.814 --> 01:21.949
* Strength in numbers

01:21.982 --> 01:23.784
Nothing but net, baby!

01:25.453 --> 01:27.755
Hell good lookin bruh.
Stay up.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.923
* I'm gon' ride for my bros

01:30.258 --> 01:31.892
* You know if I got
then you got it homie

01:31.925 --> 01:34.595
* You ain't gotta ask
no questions

01:34.628 --> 01:37.498
* 'Cause what I look like
working hard just to be selfish

01:38.266 --> 01:41.235
* You ain't gotta ask

01:41.269 --> 01:44.438
* If I'm my brother's keeper,
keeper

01:44.938 --> 01:47.441
* That's my shine

01:58.619 --> 01:59.687
Robin.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.723
We have time.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.858
The judge couldn't remember
if she left her stove on
and had to run back home.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.661
Oh God, I can already tell
it's gone be a long day.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.197
Tell me about it.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.365
You clean up well, Mr. Johnson.

02:11.399 --> 02:14.868
Well I was gonna wear my velour
track suit, but I thought
this would be a better choice.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.903
So did you get it?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.738
Yep, right here.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.741
Called Jane last night,
she turned it around this
morning.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.411
This is good.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.214
I don't know if the judge will
allow it because it's last
minute but it's worth a shot.

02:26.547 --> 02:29.217
I been waiting for this day to
get here and it's finally here.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.453
Keep in mind, her attorney will
attempt to trigger you by
attacking your character.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.557
Keep your cool,
and keep your game face on,
alright?

02:43.431 --> 02:44.632
Good morning, Naomi.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.734
Morning Omar.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.970
Come a long way
since law school Robin.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.605
You look good.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.741
See you inside.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.350
Okay, so what was that
all about?

03:02.383 --> 03:05.319
Tony was the president
of the Student Law Association.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.121
We helped each other get through
a few long nights of
law school together.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.824
Oh, so he was your law school
Zaddy?

03:10.858 --> 03:13.026
Omar, stay focused.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.163
Alright Robin, I just wanna make
sure a lover's quarrel doesn't
break out in the courtroom.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.833
And I guarantee that you and
Naomi will be the only ones
battling it out today.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.068
Oh, okay.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.036
Let's go get them.

03:32.012 --> 03:36.684
Hey, guys, guys,
be very careful, that picture's
very special to me, okay?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.552
You know what,
let me help you line it up.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.390
Raise it just a little bit.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.393
Right there,
that's perfect, okay.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.029
Oh, ow!

03:49.062 --> 03:51.164
Oh, whew!

03:51.198 --> 03:54.167
That's, that's my jam!

03:54.201 --> 03:55.369
Yo.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.570
Hey!

03:56.604 --> 03:58.572
Just stopping by to check
on the progress.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.007
- [Keith] Oh yeah?
- And take you
to the courthouse.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.575
- Oh is it time to go already?
- [Jarvis] Yeah.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.776
Oh okay.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.413
Shouldn't you let
the professionals help
with those?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.247
Ah, nah man, it's not that hard.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.951
I got to reframe Bianca's
picture myself because
it needs to be perfect.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.987
I'm sure she'll appreciate
the hard work and dedication.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.525
I haven't spoken to her
since she left for Miami, um...

04:18.125 --> 04:19.627
She might not make the opening.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.795
You know what man,
I would just focus on
your big night.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.130
Yeah, you're right.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.133
By the way,
congratulations on your new gig.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.335
Ah!

04:27.368 --> 04:29.937
Man y'all moving on up
like George and Weezy!

04:29.970 --> 04:32.340
Yeah, we don't do it like that.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.974
You got to get the
snaps and claps.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.175
Nah, I'm good.
- [Keith] Come on, now.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.777
Hit it with the one time.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.278
Aight, you gone make me get into
it, you gone make me get it.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.180
[Both Mumbling Song]

04:40.213 --> 04:41.982
Wait, you know what,
messing with you.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.984
Come on man,
we gone be late.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.853
Okay, alright yeah,
you're right, you're right.
- [Jarvis] Messing with you.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.688
Hey um, el hammero
no es mi amigo.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.691
Vamonos!

04:51.659 --> 04:53.126
Wait up!

04:53.160 --> 04:54.362
[Jarvis] Come on.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.197
[Serena] Remind me why we
come here again?

04:57.665 --> 05:00.200
'Cause it's cheap
and it's my turn to treat, so...

05:00.701 --> 05:02.470
You ain't slick, Q.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.772
You okay, 'Rena?

05:05.105 --> 05:06.407
I'm just irritated.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.108
Greg got my wig twisted.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.412
Oh Serena, I heard
about the engagement ring.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.080
That sucks!

05:13.113 --> 05:16.450
Couldn't even imagine
being engaged for less
than 24 hours.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.619
I told you not to tell nobody.

05:19.119 --> 05:23.290
By nobody I didn't know you
meant the somebody
it happened to.

05:23.591 --> 05:24.792
My bad.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.929
Cindy, you're on ten,
I need you to bring it
down to five, okay?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.297
This is about 'Rena.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.435
He keeps blowing up my phone!

05:34.468 --> 05:36.937
Ew, a stalker.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.106
[LaQuisha] You need to block
that fool.

05:39.139 --> 05:43.143
My grandmother used to say
peanut butter with no jelly
is just a nut.

05:46.179 --> 05:50.984
Mm, mm, hello,
I should've ordered that.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.823
I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.658
- So sad.
- Uh-uh.

05:58.158 --> 06:02.696
We're reclaiming our right
to celebrate ourselves without
needing men to validate us.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.065
Now, you all cried out now,
gimme your phone.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.400
What're you doing?

06:07.735 --> 06:10.871
The best way to get
over somebody is to get
under somebody new.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.240
Setting up your dating profile
on Thirsty.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.842
It's plenty of fish
in the sea 'Rena.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.845
Uh-uh, I don't trust no dating
app to find true love.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.680
That's for people looking
for entanglements.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.181
That is not true.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.383
I found my French boo online.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.886
Just wait til that green card
come in the mail honey.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.054
What does that mean?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.557
No.

06:29.590 --> 06:33.193
I need to learn to love myself
before trying to love
another man.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.261
Fine.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.798
I got you tickets to see
Anderson .Paak this weekend.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.367
You know I love me some Paak.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.602
You know I got you.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.303
Oh, can I go?

06:43.804 --> 06:46.306
Sorry sis, I think the tickets
are sold out.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.777
Oh shoot, we have to go
back to work.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.279
We've been gone
an hour and fifteen minutes.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.448
Y'all coming?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.718
Technically our lunch hour
starts when we sit down to eat,

06:57.751 --> 06:58.819
not when we clocked out.

06:59.319 --> 07:00.888
I'm not getting fired.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.857
I need this job,
y'all have fun!

07:03.891 --> 07:05.392
See you later!

07:07.828 --> 07:09.329
Don't bring her to lunch
no more, okay?

07:09.362 --> 07:11.865
- I'm done, I can't.
- You got to love her.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.603
On behalf of Mrs. Johnson,
we submitted
notarized affidavits

07:15.636 --> 07:18.338
and video footage from several
witnesses, Your Honor.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.541
Good afternoon, Judge Baker.

07:20.574 --> 07:23.443
In response to the video,
we'd like to submit
a reference letter

07:23.477 --> 07:24.778
from an anger management
program.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.314
You know shots don't count
after the buzzer, right?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.117
- But your honor--
- It's too late Mrs. Turner.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.153
The court will render a ruling
based on testimonies
given today.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.454
Call your witness, Moretti.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.289
The council calls Naomi Johnson.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.658
Mrs. Johnson.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.493
Let's cut straight to the chase.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.461
What is your financial status?

07:41.495 --> 07:42.996
I'm a celebrity stylist.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.398
I earn well over
six figures a year.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.466
Okay.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.669
Well go on then with
your bad self.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.403
Any celebrities I might know?

07:50.437 --> 07:54.007
Um, Ciara, Lil John, Usher.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.809
Some of my favorites.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.645
And that sounds fun!

07:57.678 --> 07:58.211
(whispering)
What?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.583
Mr. Johnson,

08:02.616 --> 08:04.718
Occupation and income.

08:04.752 --> 08:08.822
Mr. Johnson was a Senior VP at
a tech company before
becoming a stay-at-home father

08:08.856 --> 08:10.591
while developing his software
app.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.594
So no income, got it.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.729
No, no, no Your Honor,
money is not an issue.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.497
I was given a nice severance.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.768
You got severance more times to
interrupt my courtroom, sir.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.936
I apologize, Your Honor.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.039
Mrs. Johnson, why are you
seeking sole custody?

08:26.473 --> 08:30.210
Your Honor, when we started out
it was like a dream.

08:30.644 --> 08:34.648
I mean on paper we were both
successful and upwardly mobile.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.217
But then everything changed.

08:38.051 --> 08:43.123
He became demanding and
it was clear that he wanted
a house wife.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.058
And that is not who I am.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.296
We started fighting, all the
time.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.632
I know he didn't put
his hands on you.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.234
No Your Honor, but um...

08:54.835 --> 08:59.306
he does spank our son
and his behavior scares me
sometimes.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.644
Thank you for your testimony,
Mrs. Johnson, you may be seated.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.549
Do you need a recess?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.685
If we could Your Honor.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.154
We'll resume in fifteen minutes.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.524
[Omar] Well I guess we know
who won the Oscar today.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.526
She was damn convincing.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061
But she's lying.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.430
And the judge won't even let me
speak.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.235
You know, she probably one of
Naomi's sorority sisters,
or something.

09:28.268 --> 09:33.573
I admit Judge Baker may be a
little unconventional but
there's a method to her madness.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.175
Don't fumble the ball in the end
zone.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.777
You'll get your chance.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.915
[Omar] Naomi and I got married
after only six months of dating.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.852
Now I can admit that it was
a little rushed, but...

09:45.585 --> 09:47.120
we were really in love.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.390
When she got pregnant with
our son Caleb,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.359
I felt like the luckiest man
on the planet.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.696
But then she was diagnosed
with postpartum,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.899
and it made things a little
rough
in our marriage.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.368
So rough that you
left for two months.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.438
Your Honor, I didn't understand
postpartum at the time.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
And we both needed space.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.078
But we moved past that, Naomi.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.714
Keep the dialogue towards me,
please.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.618
So the filing here says you lost
your job when you were
arrested, Mr. Johnson?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.453
It was self-defense Your Honor.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.523
- He was protecting his wife--
- Your, I got it Robin.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.526
My first instinct is
to protect, Your Honor.

10:26.559 --> 10:30.998
Now a man was cursing at my wife
and the first thing I thought
was to knock him out.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.568
And to be perfectly honest,
if I had to do it all over again
I would do it the same way.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.972
I love my wife,
and I love our son.

10:40.307 --> 10:44.244
Now Naomi thinks that the most
important thing is money.

10:44.812 --> 10:45.913
Which is fine.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.981
But to me it's...

10:49.817 --> 10:52.319
love, and just being together
as a family.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.322
Mr. Johnson where are you
currently residing?

10:55.756 --> 11:00.360
Well I'm actually in transition,
since I was kicked
out of the house.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.233
Thank you for your testimony,
you may be seated.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.568
Thank you.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.405
Mrs. Turner,

11:13.941 --> 11:16.243
I think I will take that anger
management reference letter
for Mr. Johnson.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.680
Thank you.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.887
- It's pretty late.
- I know.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.388
- Been a long time.
- Hey.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.090
[Jarvis] Damn.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.225
[Greg] I'm sorry, man.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.560
[Jarvis] Yeah, me too.

11:33.593 --> 11:34.928
Just can't catch a break, huh?

11:35.528 --> 11:38.098
Yeah.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.433
the judge uh...

11:42.602 --> 11:43.904
granted me joint custody!

11:43.937 --> 11:44.571
- What?
- No!

11:44.604 --> 11:48.175
[All Cheering]

11:48.208 --> 11:49.743
- Come on, man.
- Come on, man!

11:49.777 --> 11:51.244
Stop playing, you had me though.
- Yes, look, look, look though,

11:51.278 --> 11:52.846
there's one condition.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.182
I have to get my own place,
so Jarvis, I'm gonna need
your help.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.117
Whatever you need bro,
I got you, it's done.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.153
Hey, um...

12:03.223 --> 12:04.191
[Omar] Naomi!

12:11.364 --> 12:16.036
No matter what happened up there
today, I'm not trynna take
anything from you.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.676
Okay.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.678
[Jarvis] It's for your son,
she'll get it.

12:25.712 --> 12:29.850
Yeah um,
think it's too early
to ask for spousal support?

12:29.883 --> 12:30.884
Who's man is this?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.052
Keith, shut up.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.520
- It's too, it's too soon.
- [Omar] Keith.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.888
- Just say it's too soon!
- [Jarvis] Wait, wait, what?

12:34.922 --> 12:35.522
[Omar] Just shut up.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.890
Now Danni, slow down.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.893
Okay, tell me exactly what
happened.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.130
I'm on my way.

12:43.163 --> 12:43.964
Aye, you good bro?

12:43.997 --> 12:44.832
I don't know.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.868
Something about some
news reporters outside
my office?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.536
- Whoa.
- What?

12:49.569 --> 12:50.770
I got to go.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.906
Yo, I'm happy for you.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.980
* Ain't much above my momma,
my music and then my money

13:01.114 --> 13:03.016
[Greg] Alright,
I think this is it.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.185
Right up here on the right.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.824
There you go.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.161
Push, yeah push the seat.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.328
Just push it up, aight.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.331
And ... okay, thank you!

13:18.731 --> 13:20.200
A little slide, okay.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.238
Watch your step,
have a good day!

13:26.039 --> 13:28.541
Excuse me ma'am, excuse me,
like some water?

13:29.342 --> 13:30.677
No, it's cold out here.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.348
* My mind's on my money

13:35.382 --> 13:36.884
- Next time.
- [Greg] Are you serious?

13:43.390 --> 13:43.891
[Scoffs]

13:45.058 --> 13:46.193
On God.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.495
Yo sticky fingers,
don't I know y'all?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.498
Nah fam,
ain't no squares in our circle.

13:51.531 --> 13:51.932
Oh.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.601
Looking like somebody uncle
trynna play cool.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.703
Oh, you got jokes?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.605
Looking like the Migos on a
budget.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.242
Yo, my man, I do know you.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.810
You got an older brother
named Booney, right?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.478
Your name is uh, Reginald.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.780
Wait, your real name is
Reginald?

14:09.616 --> 14:10.918
Yeah, so?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.285
Yeah, I went to school
with Booney.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.686
When, in '79?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.290
Yeah, with your mama.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.160
She still rock them
blonde finger waves?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.428
Aye, it's good man.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.829
Tell her I said what's up.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.631
Yo, I ain't seen Booney
in a minute man.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.134
He used to cheat off my tests
in high school, how's he doing?

14:27.167 --> 14:28.501
He got locked up.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.003
Really?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.640
Damn, sorry to hear that.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.478
You do know you ain't gotta
follow in his footsteps, right?

14:40.180 --> 14:41.714
The world is bigger
than your hood.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.350
I promise you that.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.886
Y'all boys stay up, man.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.055
Be safe.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.526
Yo!

15:01.401 --> 15:04.137
Couldn't sell it anyway man,
it's a old model.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.778
No cracks or nothing, huh?

15:12.479 --> 15:14.114
My man.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.916
I ain't even gone ask
about the wallet.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.152
You wasn't gone
get it back anyway.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.292
Aye, you want to buy some water?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.459
Hell no!

15:31.965 --> 15:35.435
* Problems on my plate
and I don't speak

15:35.468 --> 15:38.438
* Got some goals of mine
with time, I reach, yeah

15:40.140 --> 15:42.075
[Woman] "On the Scene with Gene"
Productions?

15:42.109 --> 15:43.977
Yeah, it's Omar Johnson
for Eugene.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.113
[Woman] Hey Omar,
come on in.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.983
[Eugene] You are on the scene
with 'Gene.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.486
And everybody knows I keeps it
100 when it comes to news,
and music and social events.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.288
[Eugene] And I feel compelled
to say something!

15:55.522 --> 15:57.957
It is on me, it is encumbered on
me to say this,

15:57.991 --> 15:59.792
y'all rappers got to
step your game up.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.995
- Oh, don't start that 'Gene.
- I'm serious, I'm serious.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.532
These mumble rappers,
I cannot understand one thing
they say.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.734
Because it's not your
generation!

16:07.767 --> 16:09.736
Let them have their moment,
stop player hating.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.339
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah that's why,
you showing how old you are.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.540
You showing your age.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.042
They don't even say
player hating no more.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.909
- They don't?
- They say clout chasing,
or capping.

16:17.777 --> 16:22.915
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
I have a classic,
by a true legend, Isaac Hayes.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.918
And let me just tell you this,
young boys take notice.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.721
I'm trynna put you up on game,
pay attention.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.557
Take out your notepads.

16:30.590 --> 16:35.728
These ladies do not want to hear
trap music on the first date,
okay?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.097
Take that advice,

16:37.130 --> 16:38.598
and thank me later.

16:42.769 --> 16:46.106
- Ah, what up nephew?
- Unc, what up?
[Laughing]

16:47.107 --> 16:48.408
You didn't bring
no food or nothing.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.909
I just stopped by to say hello.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.744
- How you doing?
- Oh, man.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.580
- You alright?
- Come on now, I think you
popped my shoulder out of place.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.115
- Well, let me, let me pop it
back in place.
- No, no,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.250
get your big gargantuan hands
off me!

16:57.284 --> 16:59.319
Y'all big dudes play a lot.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.356
Oh I like the smile,
you look happy?
[Omar Sighs]

17:04.691 --> 17:05.692
I got him.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.695
Unc, I got
joint custody of Caleb.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.831
That's huge man.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.833
[Eugene] Aye look,
congratulations nephew,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.635
but, what does Naomi think?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.003
She'll come around.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.806
Look, my son needs me
so I just gotta do my thing.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.141
Now you hold that thought.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.675
Somebody got to hear this,
people got to hear this.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.311
I definitely need to hear it.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.978
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait,
hold up.
- When we come back,

17:26.012 --> 17:29.382
we're gonna be on live with
relationship guru, Omar Johnson.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.018
Whoa, whoa, whoa unc,
I didn't come up here
to be on the radio.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.021
[Automated Voice] "On the Scene
with Gene".

17:36.589 --> 17:37.857
[Automated Voice] "On the Scene
with Gene".

17:37.890 --> 17:41.228
Well as promised,
we are here with Omar Johnson.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.497
And you know what,
he's kind of shy,
but a good dude.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.699
Like, he'll give you
the shirt off his back.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.570
So, having said that,
how does a man like that
end up with a criminal record?

17:50.603 --> 17:53.173
- Damn unc, you just gone put
my business out there.
- I'm just asking!

17:53.206 --> 17:54.341
I got to know.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.008
Well first of all, I don't have
a record.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.344
Oh.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.746
I had a misdemeanor charge
for protecting my wife.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.316
A guy got a little aggressive
with her in the parking lot,
and um...

18:03.816 --> 18:05.952
I hit him, and broke his jaw.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.487
That sound like a record,
I'm just saying.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.123
I ain't no judge
but that sound like a record.

18:10.157 --> 18:13.160
And you a black man,
you know you guilty
until proven guilty.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.827
Yeah, trust me, I know.

18:15.328 --> 18:19.932
And you know how the media
likes to portray us:
as criminals and deadbeat dads.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.170
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold up
there some deadbeats
out there now.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.138
- And they deserve all the smoke
they get.
- Yes they do.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.141
All the smoke,
but it's a small percentage.

18:28.508 --> 18:33.280
Statistics actually say that
black fathers are the most
engaged fathers in the country.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.514
Well where they at?

18:34.547 --> 18:37.484
'Cause, I mean,
I need a new ex-husband.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
You got some friends?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.988
Yeah, I have some friends,
but they're still trynna
figure it out.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.823
We all trynna figure it out!

18:43.856 --> 18:46.326
I'm 30 years in the game,
and I'm still trynna figure it
out myself.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.329
But I can say this,
that without my wife

18:49.362 --> 18:50.963
I wouldn't be the man
I am right now.
- That's right.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.966
So uh, behind every good man
there's a great woman.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.702
Why we gotta be
behind you though?

18:55.735 --> 18:58.705
Because they say that,
talk to them, not me,
they, that's they!

18:59.739 --> 19:04.076
But there is a divide
between black men
and black women.

19:04.110 --> 19:07.079
How do we address that,
Dr. Johnson?

19:07.113 --> 19:10.082
Well I'm not a doctor, but...

19:10.450 --> 19:14.754
I just think black men and
black women should stop blaming
each other for everything.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.223
But we got to be honest here,

19:16.256 --> 19:19.292
I mean, black men do not
effectively communicate.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.628
No, no, no
that's a false argument.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.296
We communicate.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.131
So you saying I'm lying?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.934
- What are we doing now?
- Oh, y'all arguing.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.604
Alright now, I ain't no guru
or nothing, but I know
arguing when I see it!

19:31.638 --> 19:33.840
No, no, no we're communicating.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.308
Men talk.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.976
We express ourselves.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.845
But men talk to other men.

19:39.479 --> 19:43.583
I mean listen I talk to my
brothers, Greg, Jarvis and Keith
everyday about my feelings.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.519
Hold on Johnson,
ain't no free shoutouts.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.455
I'm just playing,
I'm just playing.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.490
Shoutout to the good brothers,
they good dudes.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.627
But seriously, men are scared
to talk to women because
of how they might react.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.930
Now we're sometimes criticized
and even laughed at
for being emotional,

19:57.964 --> 20:00.933
but then we're being chastised,
when we don't open up.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.469
But it starts at home.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.104
I mean, we teach young girls
to be emotional.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.973
We don't teach young boys
to be emotional.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.976
In fact, we don't even let young
boys know that it's
okay to cry.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.346
We've got a lot of work to do
to get rid of
this toxic masculinity.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.781
- What is toxic masculinity?
- Exactly.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.650
When did masculinity get to be
so toxic?

20:17.684 --> 20:18.985
It's not!

20:19.018 --> 20:20.787
Well you just said it was,
you just said it was.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.490
- Can you prove it?
- We got to wrap up y'all,
time to go to break.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.325
- Now we wrap up?
- We gotta wrap up!

20:25.358 --> 20:27.660
Please, that's toxic to me!
[Reporter] Mr. Johnson...

20:27.694 --> 20:31.298
Can you elaborate on the racial
discrimination allegations
at MACC enterprises?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.500
This is the first I've heard
about all this.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.669
Are you upset that you were used
as a pawn to buffer the scrutiny
from the black community?

20:36.703 --> 20:39.472
No comment, no comment please.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.840
Excuse me.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.247
[Danni] Mm, mm, mm.

20:48.715 --> 20:49.882
So...

20:50.383 --> 20:52.319
how does it feel to be canceled?

20:52.352 --> 20:53.386
Who canceled me?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.555
Black Twitter.

20:55.588 --> 21:00.026
[Danni] You're trending at #142
so, technically you're
not really canceled,

21:00.059 --> 21:03.129
but you will be dragged
for a few days.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.631
I need to prepare a statement.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.567
You need to let me go out there
and talk to them Mr. J.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.802
Okay, 'cause I'll tell them
to leave us the hell alone!

21:09.836 --> 21:11.771
'Cause we are not our ancestors.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.105
Am I right my brother?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.975
Danni, think about
what you're saying, that's...

21:16.008 --> 21:17.777
that's kinda a little
disrespectful.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.614
Well I read it on a T-shirt,
and it sound real good to me.

21:21.648 --> 21:25.418
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but life is like a game
of chess, Danni.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.620
How you move matters.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.623
I just need some time
to figure it out.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.325
You got it.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.663
I hear you Danni.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.965
I hear you.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.968
- We'll circle back.
- Mhm.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.136
[Reporter] Mr. Johnson!

21:47.173 --> 21:50.677
- Mr. Johnson, we want to hear
your side of the story.
