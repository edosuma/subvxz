00:14.830 --> 00:17.592
What a perfect day for the
Massachusetts marathon.

00:17.593 --> 00:19.976
Now, we've got our own
race correspondent

00:19.977 --> 00:23.396
ready to tell us all about
this 26.2-mile race.

00:23.397 --> 00:25.139
Tom, what's the mood down there?

00:25.140 --> 00:27.650
Oh, there's a tremendous
amount of excitement right now.

00:27.685 --> 00:30.075
The... the streets are packed
with spectators on both sides.

00:30.076 --> 00:32.380
You can see, the runners are
still kind of loosening up,

00:32.381 --> 00:33.914
getting ready for the race.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.392
I had a chance to talk with
the police a short time ago.

00:37.393 --> 00:40.183
They said they expect
about 400,000 people

00:40.184 --> 00:41.656
are gonna be lining the race.

00:41.657 --> 00:43.458
They're gonna be
watching as some 38,000

00:43.493 --> 00:45.460
registered runners go by,
so it's gonna be crazy.

00:45.495 --> 00:46.695
It's gonna be a great day.

01:24.993 --> 01:27.594
There's hundreds of thousands
of people out here watching.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.797
They all have family and
friends that are here,

01:29.831 --> 01:30.931
cheering, supporting them,

01:30.966 --> 01:32.701
expecting them to
cross the finish line.

01:32.702 --> 01:34.996
After you've trained, you want
to take part in a race like this.

01:34.997 --> 01:36.077
Have you seen Maura?

01:36.494 --> 01:38.462
Janie, there's 400,000 people here.

01:38.463 --> 01:41.364
I said inside the dirty robber.

01:41.399 --> 01:42.766
So how'd you get
into this marathon?

01:42.800 --> 01:43.934
I thought you had to qualify.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.502
Well, apparently, they
don't check the times

01:45.536 --> 01:46.670
of people over 75.

01:46.704 --> 01:49.973
Hello, Vanilla...

01:50.007 --> 01:51.474
Hey, 5-0, bro.

01:51.509 --> 01:53.043
What up, Rondo?

01:53.077 --> 01:54.110
You two know each other?

01:54.145 --> 01:55.946
Yeah. I arrested him. Bogus.

01:55.980 --> 01:57.113
Look... mm-hmm.

01:57.148 --> 01:58.949
...Got me some tips for you.

01:58.983 --> 02:00.483
I heard you need a good C.I.

02:00.518 --> 02:02.285
Go away.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.822
Damn! You looking fine today!

02:05.856 --> 02:06.957
You don't want to go running.

02:06.991 --> 02:08.358
You want to cut out
of here with Rondo.

02:08.392 --> 02:10.526
I got something in my pocket
will make you feel good.

02:10.561 --> 02:12.495
Oh, yeah?

02:12.530 --> 02:14.564
The ladies love this flavor!

02:15.934 --> 02:16.910
Get out of here.

02:16.911 --> 02:18.268
Go away. Yeah, yeah.

02:18.302 --> 02:20.904
Hey, Vanilla, you need any help,

02:20.938 --> 02:24.007
you come find Rondo.

02:24.041 --> 02:25.488
Okay, Casanova.

02:25.489 --> 02:27.713
All right. Go away, Rondo.

02:28.091 --> 02:29.204
Keep walking.

02:29.639 --> 02:31.206
Thank you. You're welcome.

02:31.241 --> 02:33.469
So, really, why are you doing this?

02:33.470 --> 02:34.461
I thought you hated running.

02:34.462 --> 02:35.563
Because I told my friend I would.

02:35.597 --> 02:37.198
Your friend?

02:41.554 --> 02:43.722
Oh, hi! Sorry I'm late.

02:43.756 --> 02:45.590
Still getting used to these.

02:46.692 --> 02:49.961
You didn't tell me we were
running as mallard ducks.

02:49.996 --> 02:51.863
Well, I haven't built
up my foot muscles,

02:51.897 --> 02:53.781
you know, to the point
where I can run barefoot.

02:53.782 --> 02:56.368
We'll chip in and
buy you some shoes.

02:56.402 --> 02:58.970
Well, early humans ran very
comfortably without shoes.

02:59.005 --> 03:00.994
Research has proven that
the barefoot strike pattern

03:00.995 --> 03:02.422
is much less stressful.

03:02.423 --> 03:05.446
You, talking Google... Stressful.

03:05.447 --> 03:07.439
Where's your matching outfit?

03:07.970 --> 03:10.073
No, no, no, we're
running for a charity...

03:10.074 --> 03:12.597
Professionals for underprivileged
kids of excellence.

03:12.598 --> 03:13.664
We're a team!

03:13.699 --> 03:14.899
Team "P.U.K.E."?

03:14.933 --> 03:18.069
Yes, that... That is
an unfortunate acronym.

03:18.103 --> 03:20.371
At least you're not a hot dog.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.241
Or a mustard.

03:23.275 --> 03:24.388
Stay out of this.

03:24.389 --> 03:25.962
Look, I said that I would do this

03:25.963 --> 03:28.379
because we said that we wanted
to do something together.

03:28.380 --> 03:32.682
But I am not running
like lady "puke" gaga.

03:32.717 --> 03:33.783
No.

03:33.818 --> 03:36.086
Oh.

03:36.647 --> 03:37.487
I'm sorry.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.722
I...

03:39.176 --> 03:40.679
I should have realized.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.792
I didn't...I'm sorry.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.254
Holy crap.

03:45.255 --> 03:46.427
You're not gonna cry on me?

03:46.428 --> 03:47.472
No, I'm trying not to.

03:47.473 --> 03:49.307
It's just that my amygdala
and my lacrimal gland

03:49.342 --> 03:51.109
have a connection that
I can't really control.

03:51.144 --> 03:53.879
Honey, there is no way in hell I
am taking this off, all right?

03:53.913 --> 03:56.014
I'm already running 26
miles with a camel toe.

03:56.049 --> 03:57.616
Ohh!

03:57.650 --> 04:00.919
Well, can you at least just
take off that baggy tee?

04:00.953 --> 04:03.388
Oh, come on! I'll let you
walk up Heartbreak Hill!

04:03.423 --> 04:06.415
Oh, I'm walking Heartbreak, okay?

04:06.416 --> 04:07.680
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.928
Okay. Fine.

04:09.962 --> 04:11.563
W... Name it.

04:12.661 --> 04:16.099
The next reddish-brown stain -
you call "blood"

04:16.100 --> 04:17.966
before the labs come in.

04:18.002 --> 04:18.928
You want me to lie?

04:18.930 --> 04:21.440
No. I want you to state the obvious.

04:24.225 --> 04:27.671
Hypothetically, based
on the crime scene,

04:27.672 --> 04:29.740
I will determine
whether it is possible

04:29.774 --> 04:31.708
to hypothesize that
a stain is blood.

04:31.743 --> 04:33.043
I'll take that as a yes.

04:33.077 --> 04:34.945
20 bucks says you
cramp out by mile 10.

04:34.979 --> 04:36.180
You're on. Bet.

04:36.214 --> 04:39.116
And double or nothing,
I run like this.

04:39.150 --> 04:40.250
Okay.

04:40.285 --> 04:42.119
And I have some
footskins for you, too.

04:42.153 --> 04:43.253
Don't push it.

04:43.288 --> 04:45.792
Okay. You know, my
feet are hurting,

04:45.793 --> 04:48.492
so I think I'm gonna
take mine off anyway.

04:52.689 --> 04:54.757
Now, the race has started
for elite runners,

04:54.791 --> 04:55.746
but here we go

04:55.747 --> 04:58.446
about to start our first
wave of amateur runners.

04:58.447 --> 05:00.281
Here's Tom Martin.

05:00.316 --> 05:01.816
You excited?

05:01.851 --> 05:02.984
Ecstatic.

05:03.019 --> 05:04.085
You will be.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.021
Runner's high kicks
in around mile 12.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.757
Endorphins are
comparable to orgasm.

05:08.791 --> 05:11.760
People are already sweating on me.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.572
And they're off.

05:30.346 --> 05:32.261
Ah, there's a lot of
family and friends here.

05:32.262 --> 05:34.085
There's college
students that are here.

05:34.086 --> 05:36.226
They brought their little
grills, their picnic lunches...

05:36.227 --> 05:37.019
That type of thing.

05:37.020 --> 05:39.754
There's just a tremendous
amount of support and enthusiasm

05:39.789 --> 05:42.290
for everyone that's out here
taking part in this race.

05:42.324 --> 05:45.126
Oh, your son is running.
My daughter is running.

05:45.161 --> 05:46.594
She's a police officer.

05:51.734 --> 05:55.136
Hi, guys. How you doing?
We're the Rizzolis.

05:55.171 --> 05:58.373
I'm Angela, and this is Frank.

05:58.949 --> 06:01.443
What's up, bro?

06:01.477 --> 06:03.478
I'm not your brother, "bro."

06:09.685 --> 06:12.153
All right, lighten
up, Frank. Come on.

06:12.188 --> 06:15.156
Jane's running, Frankie's working.

06:15.191 --> 06:17.125
Everybody's having fun.

06:17.947 --> 06:19.944
I mean, we're all
families out here.

06:19.945 --> 06:21.707
I'd rather hang out
with your mother.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.474
Okay, that's not nice.

06:23.475 --> 06:26.678
It's not a good way to
start the day, okay?

06:28.633 --> 06:31.222
Now, these folks are clearly
running enthusiasts.

06:31.223 --> 06:32.537
These are not professionals.

06:32.538 --> 06:34.105
And we're gonna see just
how enthusiastic they are

06:34.140 --> 06:36.941
when they struggle to the top
of Newhart and heartbreak hill.

06:39.812 --> 06:40.879
Cramp?

06:40.913 --> 06:43.048
No, a blister.
My right heel is killing me.

06:43.082 --> 06:44.382
Too much heel.

06:44.417 --> 06:47.152
Your forefoot should
absorb the shock.

06:47.186 --> 06:49.368
Strike, forefoot, toes.

06:49.369 --> 06:51.589
Strike, forefoot, toes.

06:51.624 --> 06:52.624
Strike...

06:52.658 --> 06:55.126
That's enough, jog whisperer.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.004
That's it! Great stride!

06:59.265 --> 07:02.768
Runner down. Really, really down.

07:03.472 --> 07:06.239
I-I repeat -
there's a runner down.

07:06.283 --> 07:07.242
What happened?

07:07.243 --> 07:09.242
He started zigzagging
and then he dropped.

07:09.243 --> 07:10.689
Heatstroke maybe?

07:11.071 --> 07:12.365
No, ma'am, don't touch him!

07:12.366 --> 07:14.165
She's a doctor.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.144
This isn't heatstroke. No pulse.

07:26.178 --> 07:27.979
Heart attack?

07:31.883 --> 07:32.889
Blood!

07:34.453 --> 07:35.754
Yep, that's blood.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.423
Absolutely not a
reddish-brown stain.

07:38.457 --> 07:39.791
Maura, this doesn't count.

07:39.825 --> 07:41.126
C-come here. Look, look.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.462
I see it.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.501
This was so not in
my training seminar.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.303
It's an entrance wound.
He was shot.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.205
Shock. He just bit his tongue.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.941
She said he's been shot.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.310
No, no, no. Help, help!

07:58.344 --> 07:59.878
There is a runner do...

07:59.912 --> 08:01.546
All right, you don't talk or call

08:01.581 --> 08:03.181
or e-mail or text anybody, okay?

08:03.215 --> 08:06.785
It's my duty to alert
the authorities.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.953
I am the authorities.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.021
Not mine. I'm responsible
for miles 3 to 5.

08:11.524 --> 08:15.135
Oh. You're a Buffalo scout, yeah?

08:15.136 --> 08:18.831
So it's in your honor to be
loyal and helpful and obedient?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.837
Hear that? Obedient. Okay?

08:20.838 --> 08:22.916
I want you to go get a stretcher
and some oxygen right now.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.149
Why oxygen?

08:24.184 --> 08:26.318
You do anything with that
mouth besides breathe

08:26.352 --> 08:27.686
and bad things will happen.

08:27.721 --> 08:28.754
Okay? Go.

08:29.837 --> 08:32.764
Take his pulse. He's dead.

08:32.765 --> 08:34.043
Maura, help.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.511
What, you want me to
pretend he's alive?

08:36.546 --> 08:39.214
No. I'm not gonna be
an accessory to lying.

08:40.383 --> 08:42.583
Oops! Sorry.

08:43.369 --> 08:45.688
There goes our crime scene.

08:48.992 --> 08:51.860
I understand there are hundreds
of doctors and medical workers

08:51.895 --> 08:53.696
in medical tents
throughout the race

08:53.730 --> 08:55.097
to take care of any emergencies.

08:55.131 --> 08:56.765
I guess with 38,000 runners,

08:56.800 --> 08:59.501
you're going to see
hundreds of problems, Tom.

08:59.536 --> 09:00.660
Yeah, no doubt, Sam.

09:00.661 --> 09:01.610
And as the race goes on,

09:01.611 --> 09:03.951
chances are we're gonna get
more problems and more problems.

09:03.952 --> 09:05.641
Put that right there.

09:07.978 --> 09:09.011
Okay, Maura, help.

09:09.045 --> 09:10.279
No.

09:10.313 --> 09:12.348
We're gonna get the race
officials to stop the race,

09:12.382 --> 09:14.316
follow protocol, and we're
gonna have a chance in hell

09:14.351 --> 09:15.417
of solving this murder.

09:15.452 --> 09:17.119
Listen to me -
we do have a chance.

09:17.153 --> 09:18.287
He is our evidence.

09:18.321 --> 09:19.621
I don't understand.

09:19.656 --> 09:21.652
What happens when 250,000 people

09:21.653 --> 09:23.380
who are crammed into
the city like sardines

09:23.381 --> 09:24.609
find out this guy's
been gunned down

09:24.610 --> 09:25.804
and there's a shooter on the loose?

09:25.805 --> 09:27.105
Mass panic.

09:27.139 --> 09:30.107
346 pilgrims were trampled to death

09:30.108 --> 09:31.818
during a ritual at Ramy Al-Jamarat

09:31.819 --> 09:32.796
because everybody panicked.

09:32.797 --> 09:36.252
Exactly. So you've got a Ramy
"ala Jim Jam" right here.

09:36.253 --> 09:37.396
You want that? No, I don't,

09:37.397 --> 09:39.195
but I don't want anybody else
getting gunned down, either.

09:39.196 --> 09:39.996
We can stop that.

09:39.997 --> 09:40.831
But I can guarantee you

09:40.832 --> 09:42.852
a lot of innocent people are
gonna get trampled to death

09:42.853 --> 09:45.120
if we don't contain this right now.

09:46.356 --> 09:47.356
Now help me!

09:54.480 --> 09:58.317
Get it! Get it!

10:05.729 --> 10:07.953
Ohh. Get it. Oop!

10:09.162 --> 10:10.596
Yeah.

10:12.338 --> 10:14.173
Homicide. Korsak speaking.

10:14.207 --> 10:15.874
Hey, Korsak, it's me.

10:15.909 --> 10:16.942
You're not even out of breath.

10:16.976 --> 10:18.384
I'm not running.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.110
You've been talking about
that marathon for weeks.

10:20.111 --> 10:21.045
You quit already?

10:21.046 --> 10:23.014
Korsak, we got a
shooting victim, okay?

10:23.048 --> 10:26.317
White male, 30's, no I.D.

10:27.681 --> 10:28.896
Where are you?

10:28.897 --> 10:31.122
We got him in an E.M.S.
vehicle, but we're not moving.

10:31.156 --> 10:33.459
We're... we're boxed
in around mile 3.

10:33.460 --> 10:34.860
Geez, you put it out on the radio,

10:34.894 --> 10:36.795
press will get wind of it,
we'll have a stampede.

10:36.830 --> 10:39.200
No! No, no, no, no. No one knows.

10:39.832 --> 10:40.743
Sorry.

10:40.744 --> 10:41.869
Did you pinch the shooter?

10:41.870 --> 10:43.270
No. What's the matter?

10:43.304 --> 10:46.340
Get to bric. Fire up every
security camera in the city.

10:46.374 --> 10:48.375
We got a shooter in the marathon.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.904
I was about a thousand
yards behind the victim

10:50.905 --> 10:51.617
when he went down.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.425
I didn't hear the shot. Nobody did.

10:53.426 --> 10:54.393
Silencer?

10:54.427 --> 10:55.494
Yeah. It has to be.

10:55.528 --> 10:56.544
Terrorist attack?

10:56.545 --> 10:58.464
No, it... it doesn't
fit the profile.

10:58.465 --> 10:59.833
He's not an elite runner,

10:59.867 --> 11:02.068
and... and the area's
too residential.

11:02.586 --> 11:04.993
Yeah, they'd want more
bang for the buck...

11:04.994 --> 11:06.648
Big crowd, big casualties.

11:06.649 --> 11:07.683
Start or finish line.

11:07.717 --> 11:09.418
Sniper doesn't make sense, either.

11:09.452 --> 11:11.253
I mean, tracking down
one amateur runner?

11:11.287 --> 11:12.354
You're guessing.

11:12.388 --> 11:13.622
I'm making a conclusion

11:13.656 --> 11:15.891
based on years of
experience and training.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.526
Can you see the entrance wound?

11:17.560 --> 11:20.228
Uh, yeah, looks -
looks like a close-contact wound.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.631
No, I'll verify that
when I do my autopsy.

11:22.665 --> 11:23.546
Shh!

11:23.547 --> 11:25.575
We've got people running for
at least another four hours.

11:25.576 --> 11:26.793
We can't stop the race.

11:26.794 --> 11:28.665
There is no way to safely evacuate

11:28.666 --> 11:30.377
half a million panicky people.

11:30.378 --> 11:32.312
What? Remember the
60,000 college kids

11:32.346 --> 11:34.214
who got rambunctious
after a Sox game?

11:34.248 --> 11:35.315
1 dead, 16 injured?

11:35.349 --> 11:38.151
Yeah, and that was
with 1,000 riot police.

11:38.186 --> 11:40.020
Korsak, we're not moving.

11:40.054 --> 11:41.922
You're gonna have to
work it from there.

11:41.956 --> 11:43.490
Can you get Dr. Isles on board?

11:43.524 --> 11:45.459
Yeah, she's not going anywhere.

11:45.493 --> 11:47.961
I'll run interference with
the brass, buy you some time.

11:47.995 --> 11:50.130
Okay, buddy. Thanks.

11:57.205 --> 11:58.839
Where's the nearest medical tent?

11:58.873 --> 12:00.173
Not far.

12:00.693 --> 12:01.524
Why?

12:01.525 --> 12:04.744
We need some muckety-muck
r-race official.

12:04.779 --> 12:06.480
Um, who's in charge?

12:06.514 --> 12:07.881
Ron Garvey.

12:07.915 --> 12:09.950
But you can't talk to him.
He's busy.

12:09.984 --> 12:12.319
He's gonna be a lot busier if
he doesn't help us. Get him.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.005
Get him!

12:24.031 --> 12:25.265
Come in.

12:27.068 --> 12:30.103
Hey, Vince. What's going on?

12:30.914 --> 12:31.841
We got the first homicide

12:31.842 --> 12:33.357
in the history of the
Massachusetts marathon...

12:33.358 --> 12:34.372
A shooting.

12:34.373 --> 12:35.706
Oh, no.

12:36.396 --> 12:37.746
We get the shooter?

12:37.747 --> 12:40.933
No. Rizzoli was first
on scene with Dr. Isles.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.613
Rizzoli's kept a lid on it. Good.

12:42.614 --> 12:44.185
She's a pain in the ass,
but she's a great cop.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.289
It's a lucky break, having
the medical examiner there.

12:47.323 --> 12:48.490
All right.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.392
So we got the Charles
street bridge closed down.

12:50.426 --> 12:52.894
Mass Avenue Bridge, B.U.Bridge... 
All closed.

12:52.929 --> 12:55.163
And every side street
from here to Newton.

12:55.197 --> 12:57.459
The city's crammed with
people with no way to get out.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.434
If we try to stop this race,
we're gonna have mass panic!

12:59.468 --> 13:01.725
Hey, Vince, I got to
try to figure a way

13:01.726 --> 13:03.446
to evacuate all these people!

13:03.447 --> 13:06.485
Maybe mobilize other
counties, national guard.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.350
You been brass too long, Sean.

13:08.385 --> 13:09.595
It'll take 'em hours,

13:09.596 --> 13:12.075
and even if they get here,
we'll have rioting and looting.

13:12.076 --> 13:13.610
Right now, we just
got one homicide.

13:13.644 --> 13:16.546
Let's try and keep it at that.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.814
Okay.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.717
I'll fill in the commissioner
and the governor.

13:20.751 --> 13:22.518
You think you can convince
a bunch of politicians

13:22.553 --> 13:23.753
to do the right thing?

13:26.156 --> 13:28.224
I'm gonna try.

13:28.258 --> 13:29.826
We're about an hour
into the race, Tom.

13:29.860 --> 13:32.061
Any signs of fatigue?

13:32.096 --> 13:33.874
At this point, so far, so good.

13:33.875 --> 13:34.973
We've had a couple of sprains.

13:34.974 --> 13:36.853
Right now we've got
some dehydration,

13:36.854 --> 13:38.539
a couple of cases of heatstroke,

13:38.540 --> 13:40.403
but nothing more serious than that.

13:40.437 --> 13:42.772
Although, earlier, we did
get a report of a guy down

13:42.806 --> 13:44.607
at mile marker 3 with chest pains.

13:44.642 --> 13:46.943
We... we haven't heard anything
since then, and that's...

13:46.977 --> 13:50.246
Give us some room.
Nobody comes in this tent.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.615
I need to know that I can trust you

13:52.650 --> 13:54.217
with... with a situation.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.618
My job is situations.

13:55.653 --> 13:58.688
Anybody want to tell me about
this heart attack V.I.P.?

13:58.722 --> 13:59.822
Yeah.

13:59.857 --> 14:03.493
Our heart attack V.I.P.
is a gunshot D.O.A.

14:05.062 --> 14:06.162
Right. Okay.

14:06.196 --> 14:07.430
Look, I need to call the governor.

14:07.464 --> 14:09.235
We need to run through
our contingency plan.

14:09.236 --> 14:10.939
You have a plan for
random shootings?

14:12.236 --> 14:13.903
Okay, so while you guys
are figuring that out,

14:13.937 --> 14:15.838
Maura, what do we got?
Help me get his shirt off.

14:15.873 --> 14:17.774
There we go.

14:19.677 --> 14:22.115
All right, well, the bullet
must have hit his heart.

14:22.116 --> 14:24.051
Explains why the blood rushed
when I compressed his chest.

14:24.052 --> 14:26.018
Um, can you run his number, please?
I need a name.

14:26.019 --> 14:27.412
And I need a coroner's van.

14:27.413 --> 14:29.686
I got to get this body
to a morgue immediately.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.022
Maura, you... you're gonna have
to do this here in the field.

14:36.994 --> 14:39.095
You're kidding, right? This...

14:39.129 --> 14:40.759
This body's evidence.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.791
I...

14:44.623 --> 14:46.523
You're gonna spend
the next six hours

14:46.558 --> 14:49.159
crawling back to the lab
while our killer slips away?

14:53.098 --> 14:54.331
I...Come...

14:54.366 --> 14:56.400
Jane.

14:56.434 --> 14:58.312
Okay, sure, Jane. Yes.

14:58.313 --> 14:59.888
Just give me a leatherman
and some duct tape,

14:59.889 --> 15:00.727
and I'm all good to go.

15:00.728 --> 15:02.873
Great. I got those both right here.

15:02.907 --> 15:04.429
See? Okay.

15:04.430 --> 15:06.777
So...Autopsy table.

15:06.811 --> 15:07.845
And look.

15:07.879 --> 15:09.474
Scrubs.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.581
What else do you need?
How about an ultrasound?

15:11.582 --> 15:13.259
Done. You... Eagle boy.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.727
Can you hack into a computer?

15:14.762 --> 15:16.229
I took one apart in scouts.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.664
Close enough. Come on.

15:17.698 --> 15:20.066
I got to get online
with korsak and frost.

15:22.536 --> 15:24.438
We got you, Jane. We're plugged in.

15:24.878 --> 15:26.718
Okay, who knows?
I briefed the commander.

15:26.719 --> 15:28.826
All right, is he gonna let
me handle here on the ground?

15:28.827 --> 15:30.427
I'll run interference for you.
What do you got?

15:30.945 --> 15:31.952
I don't know.

15:31.953 --> 15:34.449
Uh, the vic's name is Damon Ward.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.421
He's 33 years old.

15:35.422 --> 15:36.917
I'm running him.

15:42.843 --> 15:45.644
Guys, look, we... we got
thousands of witnesses, okay?

15:45.679 --> 15:46.812
Nobody sees a gun,
nobody hears a shot,

15:46.847 --> 15:48.280
there's no casings at the scene.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.548
What is this?

15:49.583 --> 15:53.219
Shot alert picked up audibles
at 9:00, 9:32, and 10:00.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.854
That was the starter
pistol, Sherlock.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.021
The race starts in heats.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.790
Could it have been a
random, stray bullet?

15:58.362 --> 15:59.793
It's happened before.

15:59.794 --> 16:02.661
Dennis Rainear got hit
by a stray in 1978.

16:02.696 --> 16:05.931
He ran the last 16 miles of
the Grand Valley marathon

16:05.966 --> 16:08.134
with a bullet lodged in his head.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.502
Of course you would know that.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.808
Guys, look, if the shot alert
didn't get a stray or anything,

16:12.809 --> 16:14.413
we could be dealing
with a silencer here.

16:14.414 --> 16:16.008
Which would mean a pro...

16:16.042 --> 16:18.280
A sniper up in a
window or a rooftop.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.247
If we activate S.W.A.T.,

16:19.248 --> 16:22.014
we got another problem -
like panic.

16:22.123 --> 16:24.206
I don't think this
shot came from a roof.

16:24.207 --> 16:25.758
Jane, come and see.

16:25.759 --> 16:28.027
Take us with you on the
computer, if you can, Rizzoli.

16:28.062 --> 16:30.263
Yeah.

16:32.399 --> 16:33.666
Observe the wound track.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.969
The bullet traveled to the ribs,

16:36.003 --> 16:37.403
collapsed the right lung,

16:37.438 --> 16:39.272
pierced the heart, kept going,

16:39.306 --> 16:41.541
embedded itself under
the left armpit.

16:42.223 --> 16:44.010
Let me see the wound.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.081
Confirms our theory, Jane.

16:48.115 --> 16:49.983
It's not a sniper or a terrorist.

16:50.017 --> 16:51.851
That is a point-blank kill shot.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.589
Stippling pattern reminds me
of the old '80s crack wars.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.425
So, what does that mean?

16:59.460 --> 17:02.729
It means he was shot point-blank
while he was moving.

17:02.763 --> 17:04.564
The killer was running in the race.

17:19.314 --> 17:21.415
We've got an especially
strong men's field this year,

17:21.449 --> 17:24.290
led by a couple of runners from
Ethiopia, three from Kenya.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.286
They're setting a blistering pace.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.289
We may even see a new
record set today. Tom?

17:29.324 --> 17:30.819
Well, actually, Sam, we may.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.882
Keep in mind that the
elite runners in this race

17:32.883 --> 17:36.305
want to finish in two hours
and five minutes or less.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.590
That means that all of the
best runners in this race...

17:38.591 --> 17:40.891
Nothing's leaked to the media.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.460
The, uh, governor
just got back to me,

17:42.494 --> 17:44.528
and he just got off the phone
with your commissioner,

17:44.563 --> 17:46.864
and, uh, they're gonna
let you be point on this.

17:46.898 --> 17:47.898
For now.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.834
Maybe I'll vote for him next time.

17:49.868 --> 17:52.069
Here's our victim.

17:52.550 --> 17:54.405
Damon Ward, 33.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.707
Boston-area native all the
way through high school.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.043
Lives in New Mexico.
W-what was he doing here?

17:59.077 --> 18:00.945
Flew in two days ago
to run the marathon.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.446
Some homecoming.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.248
Our vic's a living lawsuit.

18:04.282 --> 18:05.816
Guy don't have fans nowhere.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.088
Ran some shady
adjustable mortgage scam,

18:11.123 --> 18:12.790
took people's homes.

18:12.824 --> 18:14.291
Maybe one of them took him out.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.860
Run every name from every lawsuit.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.329
See if anybody he screwed is
registered to run this race.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.865
Look, this... this is all
very good news, okay?

18:20.899 --> 18:22.833
We got means, motive, opportunity.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.668
It looks like an
old-fashioned murder to me,

18:24.703 --> 18:26.837
so I have a good feeling
that we'll find our killer.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.572
Great.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.527
Wow, these are very
sophisticated tools.

18:30.528 --> 18:32.877
I don't miss my lab at all.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.588
Is that sarcasm?

18:34.589 --> 18:35.990
I think so.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.759
Well, heads up.
This might get messy, people.

18:40.554 --> 18:41.921
Am I free to go, Detective?

18:41.956 --> 18:44.023
'Cause I don't think
this is so good for me.

18:44.058 --> 18:47.520
Massachusetts general laws
chapter 27, section 4h States...

18:47.521 --> 18:48.096
Jane!

18:50.825 --> 18:53.299
Yes, Quinn, technically
you are free to go.

18:53.334 --> 18:55.034
But I don't know why you would

18:55.069 --> 18:56.936
because you got a
hell of a cop eye.

18:56.971 --> 18:58.271
I-I do?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.173
Better than any nature
scout I've ever seen.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.608
Because she doesn't know any.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.042
And... excuse me...

19:03.077 --> 19:05.512
And if you will stay, all right,

19:05.546 --> 19:08.214
I got a very important job for you.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.431
What is it? Have a seat.

19:11.432 --> 19:13.186
It requires an explanation.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.320
Yes, ma'am.

19:14.355 --> 19:16.115
Let's not get crazy
with the "ma'am," okay?

19:16.116 --> 19:18.289
I'm not exactly wearing
mom jeans here.

19:18.963 --> 19:20.947
Of course, what's so great
about this famous race

19:20.948 --> 19:23.497
is just how much fun
everyone seems to be having.

19:23.498 --> 19:25.732
Tom, I understand you've
talked to a lot of people

19:25.766 --> 19:27.334
who have a loved one in the race.

19:27.368 --> 19:29.388
Now, do they all get to
see their runners go by

19:29.389 --> 19:31.060
with this many people there?

19:31.061 --> 19:32.476
Actually, Sam, that's
a great question

19:32.477 --> 19:34.925
because a lot of the runners -
I've talked to race officials...

19:34.926 --> 19:37.317
And they say about 1/3
of the 38,000 runners

19:37.318 --> 19:39.301
have a digital chip in their shoe

19:39.302 --> 19:42.084
so that family and friends can
actually track their progress

19:42.085 --> 19:43.256
throughout the course of the race.

19:43.257 --> 19:44.455
I mean, it really is amazing.

19:44.456 --> 19:46.924
But there's a lot of ways that
people are showing their support,

19:46.958 --> 19:48.392
like this family here

19:48.426 --> 19:50.594
with their lower-tech,
hand-painted signs.

19:50.629 --> 19:54.131
Hey, Frank!
Get those sausages going.

19:54.165 --> 19:56.240
Those poor boys are starving.

19:56.241 --> 19:58.143
Yeah, well, it looks like
I'm the poor boy here.

19:58.144 --> 19:59.544
I just got another work page.

19:59.578 --> 20:01.479
Another 200 banjos down the drain.

20:01.514 --> 20:02.677
I don't want to hear it.

20:02.678 --> 20:03.933
Now, look, all I'm sayin' is...

20:03.934 --> 20:05.413
You're saying -
you're saying you'd rather

20:05.414 --> 20:09.462
have your hand up some pipe
than cheer your daughter on?

20:17.930 --> 20:19.965
Well, unless my daughter
is now Kenyan, you know,

20:19.999 --> 20:22.134
I haven't seen that much of her.

20:22.168 --> 20:24.503
I haven't seen much of
my wife out here, either.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.271
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

20:26.306 --> 20:28.440
I'm having fun out
here with people.

20:28.474 --> 20:31.138
It's the biggest party
day of the year.

20:31.139 --> 20:32.936
It's also the biggest
toilet day of the year,

20:32.937 --> 20:34.425
next to Thanksgiving.

20:34.426 --> 20:35.959
You worked on Thanksgiving.

20:35.994 --> 20:37.961
Come on, you serve
the bird at 5:00.

20:37.996 --> 20:39.396
What's the harm, anyway?

20:39.431 --> 20:41.865
Your daughter's not a turkey.

20:41.900 --> 20:45.202
Yeah, well, right now,
it looks like I am.

20:51.065 --> 20:52.544
You use your fingers?

20:52.545 --> 20:54.078
Well, she has to.

20:54.112 --> 20:56.380
The tool leaves marks.
It changes the evidence.

20:56.414 --> 20:57.448
Wow.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.200
9 millimeter.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.625
Anything on it?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.227
I can't tell.

21:10.261 --> 21:12.329
It's not exactly a S.E.M. scope.

21:12.363 --> 21:14.932
And I thought I was negative.

21:14.966 --> 21:17.835
Hand me that baggie. Yeah.

21:22.373 --> 21:25.342
Okay. I'll get this
to korsak for testing.

21:25.376 --> 21:27.377
I thought you said nobody
could get anywhere.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.415
You.

21:31.449 --> 21:33.717
You volunteer at marathons.
You run? Yes, ma'am.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.873
Sir. Uh...Detective.

21:35.874 --> 21:37.362
My best time in the 800 is...

21:37.363 --> 21:39.857
Raise your hand. The other hand!

21:39.891 --> 21:41.859
All right, I hereby deputize you

21:41.893 --> 21:44.795
specifically to run this
bullet to Detective korsak

21:44.829 --> 21:47.973
in the Boston homicide unit
without speaking to anyone.

21:47.974 --> 21:48.990
Got it?

21:49.067 --> 21:50.167
Please go.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.680
What happened here?

21:56.681 --> 21:58.348
Anybody see what
happened to this man?

21:58.383 --> 21:59.383
Sir?

21:59.417 --> 22:01.218
Anybody see what happened to him?

22:01.252 --> 22:03.787
Sir, can you hear me?

22:05.857 --> 22:07.133
This is officer Frank Rizzoli.

22:07.134 --> 22:08.942
I'm gonna need an
E.M.T. at mile 12.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.387
I got you, Frankie.

22:15.388 --> 22:16.555
I got a runner down.

22:16.589 --> 22:19.144
White male, approximately mid-30s,

22:19.145 --> 22:20.845
no pulse, no sign of injury.

22:22.325 --> 22:23.792
Copy that.

22:23.826 --> 22:25.794
We need to talk to Jane.
Hey, Rizzoli.

22:25.828 --> 22:27.495
Yeah? Get over here.

22:27.530 --> 22:29.397
They need you on the computer.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.001
Frankie's calling
in from the ground.

22:33.035 --> 22:34.669
Please tell me he's okay.

22:34.704 --> 22:35.804
He's fine.

22:35.838 --> 22:37.839
But another runner just
went down at mile 12.

22:37.873 --> 22:39.941
Oh, God. I got to
call the governor.

22:43.512 --> 22:46.181
This is bad.

22:46.215 --> 22:50.085
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a little help here.

22:54.411 --> 22:56.842
Hey, I just got off the
phone with the commissioner

22:56.843 --> 22:58.334
who just got off the phone
with the governor! Sean...

22:58.335 --> 22:59.535
Don't say a damn word!

22:59.570 --> 23:00.837
You know what the
commissioner tells me?

23:00.871 --> 23:02.509
Tells me we got a second shooting.

23:02.510 --> 23:03.404
I got to hear it from him like

23:03.405 --> 23:04.708
I'm standing around with
my thumb up my ass?!

23:04.709 --> 23:05.943
I'm sorry, Sean, but -
No, you'll be sorry

23:05.944 --> 23:08.020
when you're counting pencils
in the property room!

23:08.021 --> 23:11.022
What the hell, Vince?

23:13.493 --> 23:14.693
So, what'd you say?

23:16.562 --> 23:19.297
I said something stupid.

23:19.332 --> 23:23.502
I just gave my word that
my team will get this done.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.670
You know how far out on a
limb I am on this, Vince? Hmm?

23:25.705 --> 23:26.805
Do you have any friggin' idea

23:26.839 --> 23:28.640
what I'm putting on the
line for you and Rizzoli?

23:28.674 --> 23:30.809
Yeah, I do. We got this.

23:30.843 --> 23:34.479
You better. Or we'll
both be counting pencils.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.752
Uniform brought in this kid.

23:40.786 --> 23:42.154
He's got an evidence
bag with a bullet,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.555
and I can't get him
to say anything,

23:43.589 --> 23:45.524
and he won't let go of it.
Are you Quinn?

23:45.994 --> 23:48.281
Is that the bullet
from the first victim?

23:48.282 --> 23:50.049
How many are there?

23:50.474 --> 23:52.664
Please don't tell Detective
Rizzoli I talked.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.399
Give me the bullet, kid.
You can talk to me.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.369
She said that if I talked to
anyone, bad things would happen.

23:57.403 --> 23:58.970
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.238
I'd rather go home.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.507
Sit down till I say you can go.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.542
Okay.

24:03.576 --> 24:06.645
The only one you
talk to is him or me.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.079
You got it?

24:08.114 --> 24:11.183
You know what kind of merit
badge you'll get for this, son?

24:17.356 --> 24:18.657
Open up!

24:18.691 --> 24:19.858
All right, in here.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.626
Okay, put him on the table.
Right there?

24:21.661 --> 24:22.661
Yep. Okay.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.096
All right, 1, 2, 3.

24:27.565 --> 24:29.232
What in the hell's going on here?

24:29.266 --> 24:31.401
We got two runners murdered,
we don't know why,

24:31.435 --> 24:33.353
and we think the killer
is running in the race.

24:33.354 --> 24:35.218
A-and you didn't feel the
need to tell me this?

24:35.219 --> 24:37.622
I couldn't, okay?
I had to keep it off the radios.

24:37.623 --> 24:40.323
Jane, ma and pop are out
there in the middle of it.

24:40.357 --> 24:43.192
I know that. There are a lot
of mas and pops out there.

24:43.227 --> 24:45.261
All right. Okay, you're right.

24:46.463 --> 24:48.030
So, what do you have?

24:48.065 --> 24:49.915
Nothing solid.

24:50.427 --> 24:51.855
I'll do what I can, okay? I know.

24:51.856 --> 24:53.557
Just got off the phone
with the governor.

24:53.591 --> 24:54.992
He wants to engage
the national guard

24:55.026 --> 24:56.026
and shut this thing down.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.288
He can't do that.

24:57.289 --> 25:00.036
You're gonna create panic
and multiple casualties.

25:00.037 --> 25:00.876
Look, for all we know,

25:00.877 --> 25:03.019
there is a serial killer
loose, a terrorist.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.394
We need to get people
off the streets!

25:05.395 --> 25:07.443
Okay, just look.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.457
Okay, both these guys have

25:11.458 --> 25:14.198
the exact same close-contact
entrance wounds, okay?

25:14.199 --> 25:15.366
That means same shooter.

25:15.401 --> 25:17.302
Out of all of these people,

25:17.336 --> 25:18.469
our two victims...

25:18.504 --> 25:21.205
Two white guys about the
same age, all right?

25:21.240 --> 25:23.107
There... there's a connection here.

25:23.142 --> 25:25.410
There's... there's not
some random shooting.

25:25.444 --> 25:27.111
These guys are being targeted.

25:27.146 --> 25:28.105
All right, that is a theory.

25:28.106 --> 25:30.025
We are shutting this thing down.

25:30.082 --> 25:31.082
Hey, hey, hey.

25:31.116 --> 25:33.584
Look, I need you to
man up here, okay?

25:33.585 --> 25:36.487
Or you're gonna have your
big disaster... mass panic.

25:36.522 --> 25:38.690
And then the shooter's gonna
slip away in the chaos,

25:38.724 --> 25:41.025
and you're gonna have innocent
people trampled to death.

25:41.060 --> 25:42.736
Just give me a little more time,

25:42.737 --> 25:44.078
let me figure out the
connection between them.

25:44.079 --> 25:45.003
I will find the killer.

25:45.004 --> 25:46.384
All I can do is try to advocate

25:46.385 --> 25:48.700
for normal operations
to continue for now.

25:48.701 --> 25:51.102
Just tell the governor that
we got things handled here.

25:51.137 --> 25:53.638
All right.
If this thing blows up...

25:54.234 --> 25:55.923
Bomb's in your hands.

25:56.484 --> 25:58.123
Wouldn't be the first time.

26:06.030 --> 26:08.598
Wow. Picking a fight
with the governor.

26:08.632 --> 26:10.366
You're fearless.

26:10.401 --> 26:11.583
No, I'm not.

26:11.584 --> 26:13.719
Come on, Jane.
Maybe we should stop the race.

26:13.753 --> 26:14.853
Maura, we stop this race,

26:14.888 --> 26:16.755
we send a message to
thousands of people

26:16.789 --> 26:17.856
that we give in to fear.

26:17.891 --> 26:19.892
We don't give in to fear!

26:19.926 --> 26:21.842
Okay, I understand.

26:21.843 --> 26:23.050
I... if we do,

26:23.051 --> 26:25.764
then we just end up dying
a little bit every day.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.867
Which, metabolically
speaking, we do anyway.

26:28.902 --> 26:31.036
Maura!

26:31.070 --> 26:32.905
Really?

26:46.886 --> 26:48.053
Come on!

26:52.158 --> 26:53.992
There's Mike! Yay, Mike!

26:58.298 --> 27:00.499
Jane, where are you? Are you close?

27:00.533 --> 27:03.335
Uh, no, ma, I'm not.
I-I got a bad cramp, okay?

27:03.369 --> 27:05.604
So you and pop should just go home.

27:05.638 --> 27:09.641
We've been here for hours!
Your father's gonna be furious!

27:09.676 --> 27:11.610
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

27:11.644 --> 27:13.245
I-I didn't mean to disappoint you.

27:13.279 --> 27:15.781
Yeah, well, that's disappointing.

27:20.286 --> 27:22.087
What'd she say?

27:22.121 --> 27:24.790
She's not running. She cramped out.

27:24.824 --> 27:26.725
Crapped out? Janie?

27:26.759 --> 27:28.260
No, cramps.

27:28.294 --> 27:30.829
She's not in the race.

27:30.863 --> 27:32.898
Unbelievable.

27:37.670 --> 27:39.371
What are you doing?

27:39.405 --> 27:40.872
I'm packing up. Why?

27:40.907 --> 27:43.575
Why? Janie's not running.
We're out of here.

27:43.610 --> 27:44.874
I don't want to go home.

27:44.875 --> 27:46.345
Well, I can see why, you know?

27:46.379 --> 27:47.579
You're the life of the party.

27:47.614 --> 27:49.648
And, uh, you're the party pooper.

27:49.682 --> 27:52.317
Well, I wasn't exactly
getting an invitation,

27:52.352 --> 27:53.585
you know what I mean?

27:53.620 --> 27:55.687
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?

27:55.722 --> 27:57.589
We've been out here for five hours.

27:57.624 --> 28:00.525
And the only words you said to
me was "fire up the barbecue"

28:00.560 --> 28:01.827
and "open up some beers."

28:01.861 --> 28:03.528
You know, I feel
like I work for you.

28:03.563 --> 28:05.816
If I'm gonna work, I want to
go home and get paid for it.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.022
Okay, that's not true.

28:07.023 --> 28:08.069
Sure it is.

28:08.070 --> 28:11.292
You know, you always talk about
family and being together.

28:11.293 --> 28:14.045
You know, I'm right here, Angela.
I'm right here.

28:14.046 --> 28:15.980
And you're spending the whole day

28:16.014 --> 28:19.350
swapping chicken
parm recipes all day.

28:22.921 --> 28:26.223
I'm sorry, Frank.

28:26.258 --> 28:29.827
I...I want to be here with you.

28:31.196 --> 28:33.564
Come on.

28:33.598 --> 28:36.967
Come here. Yeah, who could tell?

28:37.002 --> 28:39.003
Oh, my baby.

28:41.006 --> 28:42.371
Can you I.D. the bullet?

28:42.372 --> 28:43.574
Think so.

28:44.170 --> 28:46.155
We got a witness on
the second shooting.

28:46.156 --> 28:48.579
Let me talk to him. Bring him in.

28:48.974 --> 28:50.112
Hey, Vanilla.

28:50.113 --> 28:51.400
I was hoping it'd be you, baby!

28:51.401 --> 28:54.135
Damn! Them shorts is slammin'!

28:54.313 --> 28:56.887
Man, what you doing up in here?

28:56.888 --> 28:58.656
Rondo, just tell me what you saw.

28:58.690 --> 28:59.657
Oh, I saw it all.

28:59.691 --> 29:00.758
Dude was running.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.393
Next thing you know, he fell out.

29:02.427 --> 29:04.295
I knew that player was shot.

29:04.329 --> 29:05.362
But... that him?

29:05.397 --> 29:06.363
Wh... which...?

29:06.398 --> 29:07.932
Did you see who shot him?

29:07.966 --> 29:09.800
I might have missed that part.

29:09.834 --> 29:12.588
Uh, my eyes was fixated
on this fine freak

29:12.589 --> 29:14.605
looking all perfect
in her running stuff.

29:14.639 --> 29:17.241
But she was no you,
but who is, right?

29:17.275 --> 29:20.244
So you saw a hot girl
running in shorts.

29:20.278 --> 29:22.346
You're a hero. Yes, I am.

29:22.380 --> 29:24.582
And every hero needs his hottie.

29:24.616 --> 29:27.418
Get him out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.588
Jane, the bullet's a 9
millimeter hollow point.

29:30.622 --> 29:31.689
It's a hit man's bullet.

29:31.723 --> 29:32.990
Okay.

29:33.024 --> 29:34.358
Which is why it looks like

29:34.392 --> 29:36.093
a grenade went off in their chests.

29:36.515 --> 29:38.629
Grooves on the slug
indicate a silencer.

29:38.663 --> 29:40.230
Where'd you learn that?

29:40.265 --> 29:41.565
You.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.033
I pay attention.

29:44.502 --> 29:46.103
Push in more.

29:50.008 --> 29:52.776
See, there are synthetic
fibers on the bullet.

29:52.811 --> 29:55.079
Looks like various
polymeric resins.

29:55.113 --> 29:56.113
What is that?

29:56.147 --> 29:58.082
Pleather.

30:04.689 --> 30:06.223
Come here.

30:11.029 --> 30:12.963
The gunshot trajectory

30:12.998 --> 30:16.567
along with the fibers
found on the bullet

30:16.601 --> 30:19.837
suggests that our suspect...

30:19.871 --> 30:22.006
Was shooting from here.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.041
That's it.

30:24.075 --> 30:27.845
That's it! The suspect is
shooting from a fanny pack.

30:27.879 --> 30:28.979
That explains the pleather.

30:29.014 --> 30:31.183
That explains why nobody
saw anything suspicious.

30:31.184 --> 30:32.159
Jane. Yeah.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.117
Yeah, yeah.

30:33.885 --> 30:35.986
Our two victims went
to high school together

30:36.021 --> 30:37.287
right outside Boston.

30:42.861 --> 30:44.695
Whoa.

30:44.729 --> 30:46.030
We got something big.

30:46.064 --> 30:48.699
Both their names just popped
up on an old criminal case.

30:48.733 --> 30:50.000
What kind of case?

30:50.035 --> 30:51.502
Don't know. It's sealed.

30:51.536 --> 30:53.037
File's in the courthouse.

30:53.071 --> 30:54.371
Damn it.

30:54.406 --> 30:56.540
A court order will take
hours, if we get a judge.

30:56.574 --> 30:58.208
I got an idea.

30:58.243 --> 31:00.177
What, you gonna break in?

31:00.211 --> 31:01.912
Yes, I am.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.064
You in yet?

31:20.098 --> 31:22.399
You mean since you
asked 30 seconds ago?

31:24.869 --> 31:27.471
Ah! Here it is...

31:27.505 --> 31:30.674
State of Massachusetts v. Ward and Walker.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.576
Open it.

31:32.610 --> 31:34.645
Good idea, Korsak.

31:34.679 --> 31:38.182
Abracadabra.

31:38.216 --> 31:40.317
Oh. Your way didn't work.

31:47.892 --> 31:50.327
Tell Rizzoli you can't do it.

32:02.741 --> 32:05.735
Jane, our two "victims"

32:06.177 --> 32:08.084
raped a 15-year-old girl

32:08.085 --> 32:11.281
back in 1995... Samantha Bown.

32:11.316 --> 32:14.685
They did a rape kit and serology.
Where are the results?

32:19.557 --> 32:21.759
Oh, God.

32:21.793 --> 32:25.062
Jane, look at this.

32:27.132 --> 32:28.665
Monsters beat her.

32:30.235 --> 32:33.403
Seems like a solid case.

32:33.438 --> 32:34.905
Oh, man.

32:35.940 --> 32:37.341
They videotaped it.

32:39.744 --> 32:41.612
Why didn't this go to trial?

32:41.646 --> 32:45.206
Because there's a third
defendant... Jim Filmore.

32:45.207 --> 32:48.652
Filmore? The Filmore family -
It's a very wealthy family.

32:48.686 --> 32:50.621
Filmore must have
bought off the D.A.

32:50.655 --> 32:53.056
No one ever got access
to the rape footage.

32:53.091 --> 32:54.291
You know, part of me

32:54.325 --> 32:57.227
wants to let this shooter
finish off this asshole.

32:58.396 --> 33:00.597
Check the marathon database.
See if he's running.

33:03.668 --> 33:05.068
Filmore's registered.

33:05.103 --> 33:07.704
So, our third victim
is still in this race.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.879
No. Only about half of them do

33:17.913 --> 33:19.100
so their families.

33:19.101 --> 33:20.713
Wait... uh, he had
to qualify, right?

33:20.714 --> 33:23.121
So what if we track
him by his time?

33:23.122 --> 33:25.357
Hmm.

33:25.391 --> 33:28.026
He runs a lot, but
he's pretty erratic...

33:28.061 --> 33:30.529
7-minute mile in Miami,
10 minutes in New York.

33:30.563 --> 33:31.955
That doesn't really narrow it down.

33:31.956 --> 33:35.667
He could be anywhere from
mile 20 to mile 25.5.

33:35.702 --> 33:36.999
25.5?

33:37.000 --> 33:38.089
Well, based on my calculations...

33:38.090 --> 33:39.992
Please tell me later.

33:39.993 --> 33:41.657
W-what about Samantha
Brown, the rape victim?

33:41.658 --> 33:43.829
Is she registered in the race?
Not registered.

33:43.863 --> 33:45.931
Got a driver's license, though.

33:45.965 --> 33:47.766
800 Chestnut Hill.

33:47.801 --> 33:49.868
That's two blocks away.

33:50.369 --> 33:52.032
You need backup.

33:52.033 --> 33:54.573
No, it'll take too long. It's...

33:55.508 --> 33:58.377
I got an idea for backup. Come on.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.347
This race has run
so smoothly today.

34:01.381 --> 34:03.549
We're getting reports that
the number of injuries

34:03.583 --> 34:05.826
is actually lower than last year.

34:05.827 --> 34:06.654
Is that right, Tom?

34:06.655 --> 34:07.990
And, Sam, of course,
that's great news,

34:07.991 --> 34:10.719
not only for the city but for
the race organizers, as well.

34:13.650 --> 34:14.795
And I'm guessing somebody stumbled,

34:14.797 --> 34:16.427
put their hand out
to break their fall.

34:16.428 --> 34:18.128
Let's hope, at this point, anyway,

34:18.161 --> 34:19.663
that all of the runners
still out there

34:19.697 --> 34:21.364
eventually cross the finish line.

34:21.399 --> 34:24.301
This is not the race I had in mind.

34:24.335 --> 34:26.469
Yeah, me neither.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.873
Yes?

34:29.907 --> 34:32.275
We need to speak to
Samantha Brown, please.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.212
You can't. She's dead.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.612
What?

34:36.648 --> 34:38.815
Samantha committed
suicide a year ago.

34:38.850 --> 34:42.018
You ask me, she died
the day she was raped.

34:42.053 --> 34:43.553
We all did.

34:43.588 --> 34:45.554
I-I've seen the case file.

34:45.590 --> 34:46.889
Why didn't it ever go to trial?

34:46.924 --> 34:49.960
We've been waiting for
that answer for 15 years.

34:49.994 --> 34:51.995
Is your husband here?

34:52.030 --> 34:53.530
He's dead of a heart attack.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.898
It's just me and my
daughter, Courtney.

34:57.324 --> 34:59.192
Can we take a look around?

34:59.226 --> 35:00.593
We've got nothing to hide.

35:00.628 --> 35:03.463
Excuse me.

35:03.497 --> 35:05.031
Is she here?

35:05.065 --> 35:06.566
This her room? Why is it locked?

35:06.600 --> 35:10.270
I don't know. What are you doing?!

35:25.386 --> 35:27.153
Where's Courtney?

35:27.187 --> 35:30.990
Oh, no. Running...
In memory of her sister.

35:34.365 --> 35:37.764
Frost, do a marathon database
search for Courtney Brown.

35:46.774 --> 35:48.775
That's him. Yeah, that's Filmore.

35:50.210 --> 35:52.545
How the hell we gonna find
him in this sea of people?

36:00.721 --> 36:03.022
Oh, God. She's my daughter's age.

36:03.057 --> 36:06.359
It's nothing but a damn tragedy.

36:07.265 --> 36:10.176
I'm looking at a security
camera at mile 20.

36:11.590 --> 36:13.370
Mile 21.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.185
Maybe he's making good time.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.745
Dr. Isles calculated he could
be all the way to mile 25.5.

36:21.887 --> 36:23.788
There.

36:23.822 --> 36:25.222
Right there.

36:25.257 --> 36:26.290
Damn, Frost, good eye.

36:26.325 --> 36:28.426
Frankie, we got him. Mile 25.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.895
We're two minutes out.

36:30.929 --> 36:32.897
Come on, Rizzoli.

36:35.597 --> 36:36.773
Come on!

36:36.774 --> 36:40.137
All right, frost, where
they at? Talk me in.

36:40.172 --> 36:42.540
Middle of the street,
maroon running outfit.

36:42.574 --> 36:43.874
Can you see him?

36:43.909 --> 36:45.610
Not yet.

36:45.644 --> 36:47.942
Wait! Yeah, yeah.

36:47.943 --> 36:48.796
Can you get to him?

36:48.797 --> 36:50.663
Jane, there! About 20 yards ahead.

36:50.697 --> 36:51.764
Is he running alone?

36:51.799 --> 36:53.900
Yeah, I think so. Not anymore.

36:53.934 --> 36:56.069
That's the shooter, right?
The girl?

36:56.520 --> 36:58.558
Yeah. Hope they can get there.

36:58.559 --> 36:59.863
Come on, Rizzoli!

37:05.839 --> 37:07.095
Hey, Jim.

37:08.183 --> 37:09.386
Excuse me?

37:09.898 --> 37:13.087
You're making good time.
I almost didn't find you.

37:15.724 --> 37:17.091
Do I know you?

37:17.126 --> 37:19.861
No, but, uh, my sister did.

37:19.895 --> 37:22.330
Samantha Brown?

37:26.001 --> 37:27.802
I don't know who
you're talking about.

37:27.836 --> 37:30.271
Sure you do. She was a freshman.

37:30.306 --> 37:31.639
You were a senior.

37:31.674 --> 37:33.174
You remember homecoming?

37:33.208 --> 37:36.744
Where you raped her, along with
your two other running buddies.

37:46.922 --> 37:47.989
There!

37:48.023 --> 37:49.390
Watch out!

37:49.425 --> 37:50.625
Come on, Rizzoli!

37:50.659 --> 37:52.593
You're crazy.

37:52.628 --> 37:55.730
That's what you called my sister
when they let you walk away!

37:55.764 --> 37:57.398
She didn't get to walk away!

37:57.433 --> 37:58.933
I don't know what
you're talking about!

37:58.968 --> 38:01.002
Courtney, don't do it!

38:01.036 --> 38:02.537
Wait! One more!

38:05.386 --> 38:07.287
One more! Just one more!

38:07.322 --> 38:08.455
All right! Please.

38:08.490 --> 38:10.023
Please! Easy!

38:10.058 --> 38:12.626
Just let my sister rest in peace!

38:13.661 --> 38:16.163
Murder never brings any peace,

38:16.197 --> 38:18.432
to the living or the dead.

38:18.466 --> 38:19.633
Go ahead. I got her.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.401
No. No!

38:21.436 --> 38:23.103
What happened?

38:23.138 --> 38:25.108
She killed Damon and Ray?

38:25.109 --> 38:27.381
They didn't survive their injuries.

38:27.908 --> 38:30.744
Burn in hell with your
sister, you crazy bitch!

38:30.779 --> 38:32.846
Calm down!

38:33.645 --> 38:35.029
Janie.

38:37.685 --> 38:39.257
James Filmore, you are under arrest

38:39.258 --> 38:40.868
for the rape of Samantha Brown.

38:40.869 --> 38:42.102
I guess you know who I am?

38:42.137 --> 38:43.671
Yeah, I know who you are.

38:43.705 --> 38:45.005
And I know what you did.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.908
You gang-raped a 15-year-old girl.

38:47.943 --> 38:51.245
Statute of limitations is up.
You can't charge me.

38:51.279 --> 38:52.446
You're too late.

38:52.481 --> 38:55.616
Yeah, you missed
one technicality...

38:55.650 --> 38:58.719
You raped Samantha when she was 15.

38:58.753 --> 39:03.324
Statute says 15 years from
the time the victim turns 16.

39:05.044 --> 39:06.894
Statute hasn't run out yet!

39:06.928 --> 39:08.562
Huh? No.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.997
Come here. Yeah.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.991
Nobody to pay off this time.

39:14.803 --> 39:18.172
We've got the situation secured.
Thanks, guys.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.509
Well, you're one
lucky son of a bitch.

39:21.543 --> 39:23.982
You could have told me
Rizzoli can run her ass off.

39:24.327 --> 39:25.046
I don't know.

39:25.047 --> 39:26.712
I was kind of looking forward
to counting pencils with you.

39:26.713 --> 39:28.744
This is kind of stressful.

39:29.384 --> 39:31.519
Yeah, what a day.

39:31.553 --> 39:33.554
You did good.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.456
You too. Still got your balls.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.431
You mean even though I'm brass?

39:38.432 --> 39:41.362
Yeah. Even though you
joined the dark side.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.401
Thanks, Sean.

39:57.368 --> 40:00.047
Hi. Is that the guy you saw?

40:00.553 --> 40:01.699
Could be.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.285
But I know I seen that
fine bitch there before.

40:06.221 --> 40:08.289
What did she do?

40:08.881 --> 40:11.225
Well, what do you know?
Old Rondo saw something.

40:11.259 --> 40:13.694
Give me 40 bucks. What for?

40:13.728 --> 40:15.429
For finishing the race.

40:15.463 --> 40:16.830
But you didn't finish the race.

40:16.865 --> 40:18.599
I will.

40:18.633 --> 40:20.034
And I need a loan. All right.

40:20.068 --> 40:21.835
40 bucks? Yeah.

40:21.870 --> 40:24.338
All right. There you go.

40:24.372 --> 40:25.906
Thank you.

40:26.556 --> 40:27.627
Hey!

40:27.628 --> 40:28.642
Next time you see something,

40:28.677 --> 40:30.878
you come talk to me, all right?

40:31.165 --> 40:36.161
You mean, I am now your
confidential informant, Vanilla?

40:38.920 --> 40:40.220
Great plan.

40:41.068 --> 40:42.201
I'll see ya.

40:42.236 --> 40:43.660
Where you going?

40:43.661 --> 40:45.592
Heartbreak hill.

40:49.299 --> 40:52.434
Oh, now all that's left is
the cleanup. Big job, Tom.

40:52.469 --> 40:54.036
The race is finally over.

40:54.070 --> 40:55.838
All of the runners
have, in some cases,

40:55.872 --> 40:57.439
struggled across the finish line.

40:57.474 --> 40:58.941
But now it's a chance
for them, I think,

40:58.975 --> 41:00.609
to grab a bottle of
water, put their feet up,

41:00.644 --> 41:01.671
catch their breath.

41:01.672 --> 41:03.287
You know, looking around,
it doesn't look that bad,

41:03.288 --> 41:05.180
considering we had hundreds
of thousands of people

41:05.215 --> 41:06.615
in the streets of Boston today.

41:06.650 --> 41:07.783
Uh, it was a good day.

41:07.817 --> 41:10.152
It was a great race, and
I think it's terrific

41:10.186 --> 41:12.755
that we're able to hold
huge events like this today

41:12.789 --> 41:15.224
in American cities.

41:15.258 --> 41:16.859
How's the heel?

41:16.893 --> 41:18.093
It's good.

41:18.128 --> 41:20.362
I think that runner's
high is kicking in.

41:20.397 --> 41:21.764
Yeah.

41:23.533 --> 41:25.768
Maybe you should run
with Garvey next year.

41:25.802 --> 41:27.336
Are you kidding?

41:27.370 --> 41:29.204
I'm not the one he wants to chase.

41:32.313 --> 41:34.276
You want to race, huh?
Yeah, I want to race.

41:34.310 --> 41:35.811
I was born to run!

41:37.167 --> 41:39.695
Come on, girls!

41:39.696 --> 41:41.095
Come on! Whoo!

41:47.357 --> 41:49.191
Dad!

41:49.225 --> 41:50.926
You did it! Great job.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.340
You did it!

41:52.341 --> 41:53.595
Great job. Great job.

41:53.630 --> 41:55.579
I'm so proud of you!

41:55.779 --> 42:05.979
