00:02.294 --> 00:03.546
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.754 --> 00:06.052
Russia is your home. Let me go save mine.

00:06.256 --> 00:09.055
<i>People are gonna wanna know
where I've been for the past five years.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:12.183
<i>It's easier if I'm just a simple castaway.</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:16.354
I'm afraid you're going
to miss your boat home.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.936
What's so funny about my father's legacy?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.113
He was going to disown you.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.610
With help from the Green Arrow
and his team,

00:25.859 --> 00:29.204
the Throwing Star Killer
is now behind bars,

00:29.404 --> 00:31.077
<i>and our streets are a little safer.</i>

00:33.075 --> 00:37.546
<i>Former District Attorney Adrian Chase
faces multiple counts of capital murder,</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:38.747
<i>among other charges.</i>

00:38.956 --> 00:42.460
<i>SCPD spokesperson Alison Rou
credits the Green Arrow</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:46.172
<i>with bringing the man known as
the Throwing Star Killer to justice.</i>

00:46.964 --> 00:51.390
Well, it looks like the Green Arrow
is a hero again. Whoever he is.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.595
Yep. And the mayor
ain't doing too bad, either.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.432
The Sentinel's got your approval rating
back up to 70%.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.018
What? Was it ever that high?

00:59.309 --> 01:01.937
No, it was wasn't.
Um, anyway, listen, if you'll excuse me,

01:02.145 --> 01:04.647
I gotta go find Rene
and remove his head from his ass.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.320
- Wait, what?
- He missed a hearing

01:06.525 --> 01:07.777
about possibly getting his daughter back.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.032
- Hey, Quentin?
- Yeah?

01:09.486 --> 01:11.284
If you need any help with that,
just let us know, okay?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.081
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, will do.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.535
Oh, by the way, um,
I'm sorry I almost forgot.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.917
Happy birthday, Mr. Mayor.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.457
Thank you.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.919
We should go get a drink tonight.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.929
We haven't celebrated your birthday in...
I can't remember how long.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.928
Remember the last time
we celebrated yours?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.426
Oh, God, we decided
we would never talk about that again.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.853
Four years?

01:36.138 --> 01:37.310
You've changed a lot, Speedy.

01:37.681 --> 01:41.527
We both have.
Just not sure I have for the better.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.982
I'm sure.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.648
Look, Thea, uh,

01:45.856 --> 01:48.154
being happy doesn't mean
you don't have issues.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.986
It just means that you're working on them.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.490
When did you become all Zen-like
and well-adjusted?

01:55.616 --> 01:58.870
We should celebrate that tonight,
as well as your birthday.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.954
I appreciate that,
but I already have plans.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.381
With who?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.677
Please say "not Susan Williams."

02:07.127 --> 02:09.971
Um, it... NO, uh, with Felicity.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.682
As in a date?

02:12.883 --> 02:16.228
As, uh...
As in I don't know if it's a date.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.979
But you're hoping that it is?

02:18.180 --> 02:21.229
It's dinner.
People go to dinner.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.860
See, I don't believe you,
but I find it incredibly cute.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.099
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

02:54.591 --> 02:58.095
Happy birthday. Everything hurt.
Everything hurts here.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.736
Yes!

03:05.936 --> 03:07.529
I love the cake,
where did you get it?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.026
Lord Mesa Bakery.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.273
What's up with number six?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.532
Is that for the number of members
of the team?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.076
- It's cool.
- Actually, I ordered the cake

03:13.276 --> 03:15.529
for a six-year-old because I wasn't sure

03:15.737 --> 03:18.206
that I could order a Green Arrow cake
for a grown man.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.581
Well, hey,
Oliver's a child at heart, right?

03:22.202 --> 03:24.546
That is the concussion talking,
yep, for sure.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.043
I'm really sorry about that, Curtis.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.757
No, that's okay. But you should know

03:27.958 --> 03:30.882
that if I'd had my T-Spheres,
I would have...

03:31.086 --> 03:32.383
Would've what?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.134
Would have still been on the floor.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.926
I'm very sorry.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.763
Mmm.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.599
I was worried
this might've got hurt.

03:43.807 --> 03:44.808
What is it?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.069
They are sound modulators
that I've been working on for Dinah.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.648
Not only will they be able to
focus her canary cry,

03:50.814 --> 03:53.567
but they will be able to override
any kind of sonic dampeners.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.152
- Yes.
- She's coming, right?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.905
Yeah. She said if work didn't go too late,
then she'd swing on by.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.573
Thank you.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.953
- Cake. Here you go.
- Yes!

04:04.161 --> 04:05.162
Lyla couldn't make it?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.665
She and J.J. are visiting
her sister in Chicago.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.959
- Oh.
- We're good, man.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.172
We'll patch things up.

04:17.966 --> 04:18.887
I'm late, aren't I?

04:19.134 --> 04:20.886
That's all good. Didn't miss much.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.184
Just Oliver flipping Curtis
over his shoulder.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.724
I told you a surprise party
wasn't a good idea.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.144
How's Rene?

04:28.643 --> 04:29.690
He's not home.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.397
There's a couple of days' worth
of newspapers

04:31.646 --> 04:32.989
piled up outside his apartment.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.192
- You're worried about him.
- Yeah, well, you know,

04:35.358 --> 04:37.736
Rene may come across
as an irresponsible idiot,

04:37.986 --> 04:38.908
but that's... No, it's just 'cause

04:39.154 --> 04:40.531
that's what he wants
people to think of him, you know.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.706
Yeah.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.375
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

04:43.533 --> 04:45.706
We're gonna do a toast in
about five minutes. So, champagne, and...

04:45.911 --> 04:47.504
- Club soda.
- All right, you got it.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.422
Really nice wrapping.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.711
Thank you.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.596
Thank you all so much
for doing this. Cheers.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.009
Cheers.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.513
I almost forgot what it was like
to celebrate a birthday.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.265
That's because we're usually

05:02.511 --> 05:04.934
saving the city from being destroyed
this time of year.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.059
Uh, it's like summer break for you guys.
What are you gonna do, huh?

05:08.433 --> 05:09.776
I've always wanted to see Florence.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.064
The city in Italy,
not the woman or her weird machines.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.904
I'm gonna teach J.J. how to fish.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.119
Few days with my son on the water,
that'll be heaven.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.739
I was thinking the Pacific Crest Trail.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.580
For a night. For, you know,
just one night under the stars,

05:25.867 --> 05:27.744
and then definitely
a manicure-pedicure afterwards.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.797
What about you, Oliver?
We know you got City Hall and all, but...

05:31.039 --> 05:33.713
Yeah, it keeps me busy.
But I need to buy some socks.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.467
Everybody has their thing.
I need socks bad.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.299
<i>Socks it is.</i>

05:40.549 --> 05:41.766
<i>Hey, we all need socks.</i>

05:42.217 --> 05:46.973
Uh, well, I think we could all use
another piece of cake, right?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.976
- Yeah, sure.
- You know, actually, I'm good.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.320
Had about three or four slices myself.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.609
- You need cake, son.
- Oh, okay.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.815
- You need to go.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I need that, yeah.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.617
Oh.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.323
That was subtle.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.078
So subtle.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.999
I guess since the dinner
at Chez Marta was a ruse,

06:06.241 --> 06:08.118
they think we deserve some alone time.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.452
Do we?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.506
Well, I mean, I didn't know if it was a...

06:13.748 --> 06:16.922
We can take it one step at a time.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.004
I would like that very much.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.805
This is hard for you, huh?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.512
Hypothetically dating my ex-fiancÃ©e?
No. It's...

06:23.758 --> 06:28.355
Wow, no, I meant summer vacation,
as they are now calling it.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.024
It's incredibly hard.
It's borderline impossible.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.813
We won.

06:33.602 --> 06:34.603
Oliver, we won.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.648
Just take a step back, you know.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.862
You can put your feet up,
no matter the state of your socks.

06:40.108 --> 06:44.158
You could just, God forbid, relax.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.662
Yeah.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.500
My government heard rumors of this place.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.004
An island prison built by the Chinese.

07:01.004 --> 07:05.555
It's incredible that you should lead me
here of all places.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.638
I killed you.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.482
Almost.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.320
But nothing ever really dies.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.148
There are always echoes.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.992
You'll learn that soon enough.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.413
The KGB call this the Red Death.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.999
It's an interrogation drug

07:29.240 --> 07:32.494
meant to break men
by inducing psychological anguish.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.832
It's why you followed me
halfway around the world?

07:37.207 --> 07:38.254
Torture?

07:39.376 --> 07:42.550
Murder creates intimacy between men.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.549
So, I'd appreciate an honest answer.

07:45.882 --> 07:49.682
If your intention was to return home,
why leave from here?

07:50.512 --> 07:51.559
Honestly?

07:52.722 --> 07:53.894
Go to hell.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.896
That's an interesting response.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.241
If my Chinese is correct,

08:04.234 --> 08:05.406
this place is called purgatory.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.870
You know the Catholics
consider purgatory to be

08:12.117 --> 08:14.461
the immediate state
following physical death?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.265
Konstantin...

08:28.383 --> 08:31.887
When I kill you this time,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.311
I'm gonna make sure you're dead.

08:38.643 --> 08:44.616
When we're done, the only person you'll
want to kill is yourself.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.904
I'm just saying, you could've taken
a big knife

08:50.113 --> 08:52.662
and cut the tension between you two.
And by tension, I mean sexual tension.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.409
Yeah, I know what you meant, Curtis.

08:54.617 --> 08:58.292
And then the way you guys dressed up
for each other? Ooh! Sizzle! Sizzle!

08:58.496 --> 09:01.170
Okay. Can you please stop?

09:01.416 --> 09:02.963
You're worse than a shipper
on a soap opera.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.421
Okay, well, look, I'm here.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.926
I hope Dinah's still up,
I think her neighbors are asleep.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.678
That's the whole point
of this modulator anyway.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.806
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no" what?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.518
- I think she was robbed.
- Do you need backup?

09:15.764 --> 09:18.859
Yeah, probably, but I'm here now,
so I gotta make sure she's okay.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.786
Hello?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.196
Dinah?

09:31.488 --> 09:35.334
If there's someone in here,
you should know that I know martial arts.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.618
Curtis, what's going on?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.711
On, my God.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.671
Curtis? Curtis?

09:41.623 --> 09:42.624
<i>Curtis?</i>

10:03.812 --> 10:04.859
Clear.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.361
We got Curtis' phone
but no Dinah and Curtis.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.693
Okay, well, if Curtis and Dinah
are missing,

10:09.859 --> 10:12.032
I guess we can presume that Rene
didn't skip out on his daughter.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.204
Whoever did this is good.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.031
We know who's doing this.

10:15.657 --> 10:16.658
It's Chase.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.077
He's picking us off, one by one.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.249
Not to state the obvious,

10:20.495 --> 10:24.375
but Chase is currently under surveillance
24/7 in an impenetrable glass box.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.425
<i>There's no way
he got out to do this.</i>

10:26.668 --> 10:27.715
Look, he had to have help.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.222
I hate to say this, but what if this was
Chase's plan all along?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.724
Get himself caught, lull us to sleep.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.018
Yeah. Well, consider me officially woke.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.270
<i>Okay, Chase has worked
with Evil Laurel before,</i>

10:37.512 --> 10:38.684
<i>but she's currently locked up
at A.R.G.U.S.</i>

10:38.888 --> 10:41.107
<i>and there is no way
that Evelyn is doing this all by herself.</i>

10:41.391 --> 10:42.392
John?

10:44.185 --> 10:45.732
Isn't that League?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.442
It's Talia al Ghul.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.744
Contact Thea and Lance,
we need to get them some place secure.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.700
There's an A.R.G.U.S. safe house
across town we can use.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.872
Okay, you get them there
and then meet me at the bunker.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.792
Where you going?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.379
It's time to talk to Chase.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.262
<i>Where are they?</i>

11:12.380 --> 11:13.757
- Adrian, where are they?
- Who?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.470
- You know damn...
- You know damn well who!

11:15.717 --> 11:17.264
You're right. I do know.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.897
Just like I know your every move,
while it seems like you know none of mine.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.103
Tell me where they are.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.313
Or what?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.812
We've already established
that you think you won't kill me.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.404
Kind of weakens your leverage.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.614
I'm gonna find them
and I'm gonna get them back.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.078
Is that what you came here to tell me,
or are you just wasting time?

11:42.619 --> 11:43.836
See you later.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.800
Oh, pain. It's fascinating, isn't it?

11:50.293 --> 11:55.094
Some men will do anything to avoid it,
others will embrace it.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.967
Even revel in it.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.472
Like you.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.643
That's why you're so formidable.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.191
Pain is not a new experience to you.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.526
Then stop wasting my time.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.491
That was my epiphany for true retribution.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.702
I couldn't merely cause you pain.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.537
I had to wake you up.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.294
Open your eyes, make you see.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.462
The pain you suffer is still with you.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.879
This drug will help set it free.

12:38.967 --> 12:44.144
Every cut, every bullet, every wound,

12:44.347 --> 12:46.850
like you're feeling it all
for the first time.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.363
Am I still wasting your time?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.045
Freeze, jerk-wad!

13:13.042 --> 13:14.089
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:14.544 --> 13:16.672
I knew it was you, but what if
it wasn't "you" you. You know?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.347
Multiple Earths, evil twins, et cetera.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.050
Et cetera being the scariest thing
I've said all day.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.218
I hate this thing. Oh.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.766
<i>I'm a little on edge.</i>

13:24.012 --> 13:25.104
I'm actually really looking forward

13:25.346 --> 13:27.223
to being holed up
in an A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.563
I don't want you in the safe house.
I want you down here with me.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.361
- What? No. Why?
- I can run comms remotely.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.357
Okay? And if Malcolm Merlyn
has proven anything,

13:35.565 --> 13:36.862
it's that when it comes to
the League of Assassins,

13:37.066 --> 13:38.033
locks are more like suggestions.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.613
I can handle Talia al Ghul
and whatever acolytes she's fighting with.

13:41.904 --> 13:47.707
Where I need you is down here with me,
so that both of us can try to stop Chase.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.412
Is this...

13:49.746 --> 13:52.374
And this might sound
a little self-serving,

13:52.582 --> 13:55.586
but is tactic the only thing
behind me staying down here?

13:56.419 --> 13:57.966
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.881
Of course not. Okay?

14:00.089 --> 14:03.263
The thing that's clear, though,
to me right now is that I...

14:05.386 --> 14:06.888
I let my guard down. And I shouldn't have.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.098
No one could have
seen this coming, Oliver. No one.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.939
I saw it coming.
I knew something was wrong.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.277
I knew it. Here. And I ignored it.

14:17.106 --> 14:21.612
And then I second-guessed myself, and now,
everyone that I love is in danger.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.280
Including, maybe...

14:25.448 --> 14:26.825
- My son.
- No. I couldn't find him.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.918
There's no way they're going to.
Not Chase. Not Talia al Ghul.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.119
William's gonna be fine.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.626
I appreciate that.
But you can't know that.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.961
You can't.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.009
William is the purest part of me.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.341
And now he's in danger,

14:39.587 --> 14:42.511
maybe because of something
that the worst part of me set in motion.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.641
- How'd it go?
- Thea and Quentin are not happy about it,

14:47.804 --> 14:49.147
but they're secure.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.110
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- What's going on?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.859
I had A.R.G.U.S. triple-check
on Black Siren, she's not in her cell.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.147
That's not a coincidence.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.482
Quentin doesn't know about her.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.993
It's why Chase will send her right there.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.366
We need to get the safe house
on the phone now.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.378
God, you know what the worst part
about a safe house is?

15:15.623 --> 15:18.172
It's not being able
to use your cell phone. That's just...

15:18.376 --> 15:19.377
That's barbaric.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.550
Well, yeah, normally I'd chalk that up
to millennial nonsense,

15:21.796 --> 15:22.718
but I know what you mean.

15:22.964 --> 15:26.389
I'm chomping at the bit to speak to
that judge on Rene's case right now.

15:26.676 --> 15:27.802
Well, what could you say?

15:28.010 --> 15:32.390
That Rene was kidnapped by some psycho
that's in jail? That...

15:33.349 --> 15:34.851
I gotta do something, Thea.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.360
I know what it's like to lose a daughter,

15:36.561 --> 15:38.234
and hell if I'm gonna
let that happen to Rene.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.401
Right.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.822
Agent Kosinski. Hello?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.704
Hey, Sharon, we got a problem
with the comms in the...

15:49.866 --> 15:51.209
Stay here.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.368
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

15:52.535 --> 15:54.162
but I'm sure as hell
not staying here waiting.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.714
You read my mind. Let's go.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.551
It's a tranq dart.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.026
Stop right there!

16:19.103 --> 16:21.731
Stop, turn around slowly. Turn...

16:31.908 --> 16:32.909
Hi, Daddy.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.420
No, it can't be.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.753
It can be. Daddy, it can.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.712
Don't worry.

16:46.047 --> 16:46.969
I'll explain everything.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.428
Just don't take your gun off her, Quentin.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.437
Thea, Thea...

16:53.638 --> 16:55.561
You know it's not what it seems.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.267
Okay, Ollie told...

17:09.444 --> 17:11.242
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.290
What do we know?

17:21.958 --> 17:25.303
You mean besides this being
the horror version of Groundhog <i>Day?</i>

17:25.586 --> 17:27.634
Look, the security camera footage
is grainy,

17:27.838 --> 17:31.263
but it's good enough to see Black Siren
giving her best Laurel impression.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.811
We know there was
a second attacker. Who do we think it was?

17:34.011 --> 17:34.978
Well, the A.R.G.U.S. agent

17:35.179 --> 17:37.978
that gave Black Siren
her "get out of jail free" card

17:38.182 --> 17:41.937
said that he was blackmailed by a woman
wearing black, so could be Talia...

17:42.144 --> 17:43.111
It was Evelyn.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.360
Agent Kosinski got a positive ID
before he got tranqed.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.483
So these kidnappings are what? Payback?

17:47.775 --> 17:51.655
Before Chase tortured me,
I told him that the team was my strength.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.863
He's trying to take it away.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.957
So his lady friends can come after you
instead of him?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.329
That doesn't sound very satisfying.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.037
Chase doesn't think I can game out
what he's planning, but it's obvious.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.164
Yeah. Obvious to a murdering psychopath.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.167
And present company excluded.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.553
He's trying to leverage our friends
to make me set him free.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.012
That's crazy.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.845
Which would be consistent for Chase.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.347
- You two have to leave the city.
- What?

18:14.552 --> 18:16.350
You gotta leave the city.
You gotta leave the state.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.513
And you can't tell me where you're going.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.227
Oliver, we're not leaving.
We're not going anywhere.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.395
We're not abandoning you.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.063
I understand
that you're not abandoning me.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.031
You're doing
what I'm asking you to do, because...

18:27.648 --> 18:28.865
Chase knows how I think.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.660
<i>He knows that if he puts
the two of you in danger,</i>

18:31.861 --> 18:36.037
and he's gonna try to, that my instinct
will be to pull you close.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.166
So do something he's not expecting.

18:38.909 --> 18:39.910
Split up.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.503
No, that's...

18:45.541 --> 18:46.463
What about you?

18:46.709 --> 18:49.804
If I don't have to worry
about the two of you,

18:50.046 --> 18:52.925
then I can put my focus
towards finding the others.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.641
You get this son of a bitch, Oliver.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.976
I will.

19:06.896 --> 19:07.943
<i>KOVAR". You're strong.</i>

19:08.773 --> 19:09.899
Like a piece of iron.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.953
You think you can resist any pain
because you have.

19:16.489 --> 19:21.120
But the worst pain is up here.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.584
Locked away, deep inside.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.301
That's what the drug is for.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.429
To show you everything. Your sins.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.182
Your failures.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.767
I think you made your choice.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.357
No!

19:46.769 --> 19:47.770
Your guilt.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.698
<i>Oliver! No!</i>

19:54.527 --> 19:55.619
Your bloodlust.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.121
Your inhumanity.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.975
That gun, it only has one bullet.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.016
You can waste it on me,

20:25.224 --> 20:29.070
but I think we both know

20:30.187 --> 20:32.155
who's responsible for your pain.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.159
I've seen the strongest man

20:38.487 --> 20:43.539
resist for up to 12 minutes
before ending his suffering.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.254
<i>Such is my respect for you that</i> I...

20:46.829 --> 20:49.332
I think you can last for, uh...

20:51.083 --> 20:52.505
14 minutes.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.386
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

20:59.675 --> 21:01.177
<i>You're going to do it, aren't you?</i>

21:03.345 --> 21:07.521
Because you are not strong
and you know you deserve to die.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.786
Let me help you understand.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.289
I'm not going to kill you.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.417
I am never going to give you

21:32.625 --> 21:36.801
the satisfaction of being the man
that you think I am.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.425
You're never getting out of here.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.559
Not today.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.229
Not tomorrow. Not ever.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.061
Do you understand?

21:48.599 --> 21:49.896
No, I don't.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.736
But only because you're wrong.

21:54.480 --> 21:59.737
I told you, Oliver. Everyone in your orbit
suffers as the price for your sins.

22:00.611 --> 22:05.162
And the only way to keep them
from paying that price is to let me go.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.755
I'm gonna find another way.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.671
Find it quick.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.140
They're transferring me to Idaho tonight.

22:21.590 --> 22:25.766
And once that happens,
this offer's off the table.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.476
I don't want to see that happen, Oliver.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.434
Like I told you,

22:32.601 --> 22:35.275
I think that you're one loss away
from getting destroyed.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.441
Who would it be, I wonder?

22:39.608 --> 22:42.452
Thea or Felicity?

22:45.114 --> 22:46.161
Maybe someone else.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.664
I mean, look. I don't understand,
all right? But that was Laurel.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.795
No, Quent, it wasn't.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.545
It looks like her and it sounds like her...

22:58.794 --> 22:59.966
No, that was my baby girl, all right?

23:00.129 --> 23:01.802
She's back. Just like with Sara.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.637
Listen, there...

23:04.550 --> 23:09.181
It is hard to explain, but there are
these other Earths, okay?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.560
Parallel universes.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.524
You're talking crazy. Listen to yourself.

23:12.725 --> 23:16.821
I know.
I know how crazy it sounds, trust me.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.147
But it is real.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.695
<i>It's real.</i>

23:21.317 --> 23:24.070
Just as real as meta-humans and aliens.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.330
So, that wasn't Laurel?

23:30.492 --> 23:33.211
It was a Laurel.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.333
It's just not the one that we knew.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.839
Okay, now, look. She's very convincing.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.844
And I need you to remember that,

23:45.007 --> 23:47.351
because that is exactly why
Chase has brought her here.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.685
Let's go.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.562
Where are we going?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.023
That's a surprise.

24:05.194 --> 24:09.119
Felicity, I already have major anxiety.
You going silent on me is not helping.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.117
You know,
my mom's really big into intuition.

24:11.367 --> 24:14.621
Like, stars, signs, horoscopes,
Ouija boards, even.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.713
I always thought it was
either stupid or ridiculous.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.461
Never really took it seriously.

24:18.749 --> 24:19.750
Until now, right?

24:19.959 --> 24:23.714
Yeah. I have this really bad feeling,
like right in the pit of my stomach.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.051
What's it telling you?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.224
We never should have left Oliver alone.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.758
I agree with you, Felicity.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.594
Leaving Oliver feels wrong,

25:04.753 --> 25:06.426
but maybe that's why
it was the right thing to do.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.717
You do realize
how backwards that sounds, right?

25:09.925 --> 25:12.223
I do realize that, but this is Chase
we're dealing with, remember?

25:12.428 --> 25:15.728
Yeah. I know. But what if we overthought
it and now Oliver's vulnerable?

25:24.732 --> 25:27.155
I see your sense of hospitality
remains intact.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.361
You are not welcome here, Malcolm.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.038
Do you aim to cut off
my other hand, Oliver?

25:31.238 --> 25:32.410
Maybe.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.788
You gonna tell another person
about my son?

25:34.992 --> 25:37.541
Last time I was down here,
I saved your life.

25:37.745 --> 25:43.252
Do you really think that gives you a pass
for serving up William to Damien Darhk?

25:43.459 --> 25:45.962
I'm sorry about that.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.513
I let my emotions get out of hand.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.133
<i>That is all in the past.</i>

25:50.340 --> 25:52.809
The only thing I'm concerned about now
is saving my daughter.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.145
What's that?

26:05.731 --> 26:06.698
Angry woman with two swords.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.617
You getting major Isabel Rochev
flashbacks right now?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.778
- Yep.
- You remember how we handled that, right?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.112
Yep.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.801
We gotta get out of here.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.886
That worked better with Rochev.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.518
Digg.

26:41.475 --> 26:42.818
Told you I had a bad feeling.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.128
John? Felicity?

27:01.578 --> 27:02.875
They're gone, Oliver.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.129
- Damn it!
- They were taken alive. Focus!

27:07.501 --> 27:10.380
I would've thought you would have tagged
your, your pets by now.

27:10.587 --> 27:15.468
They're my friends, Malcolm, and Curtis
did put tracking nanites in Felicity,

27:15.676 --> 27:19.351
but they were rendered useless
when Chase set off an EMP.

27:19.596 --> 27:23.726
Well, I'll give him this much.
He's 50 moves ahead.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.229
But the question is, to what end?

27:26.436 --> 27:29.280
He wants to leverage me
into breaking him out of prison.

27:30.357 --> 27:35.113
And my daughter?
Your sister isn't sufficient leverage?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.577
You've blackmailed people, Malcolm.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.117
How often have you kept up
your end of the bargain?

27:41.034 --> 27:43.378
And quite frankly, I am surprised

27:43.620 --> 27:47.124
that someone like you is willing
to give in to a man like Chase.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.551
I will give in to someone
if it gets Thea back.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.215
The fact that she hates me
doesn't make her any less my daughter.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.259
Something you learned last year,

27:57.467 --> 28:00.061
friends are one thing,
but family is family.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.227
And your child?

28:02.472 --> 28:07.023
You would do anything,
absolutely anything, to keep him safe.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.481
A little while ago, I worried that John...

28:10.689 --> 28:13.533
That the personal connections that I had
were making me vulnerable.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.328
Because as long as there are people
in my life that I care for,

28:16.528 --> 28:20.078
I have to be something else
to protect them.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.250
That's something
that I can't leave in the past.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.754
I admire you, Oliver.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.254
It takes a special kind of idiot
to actually get dumber with time.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.593
Lam not in the mood, Malcolm.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.097
Human connections are what keep us human.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.639
And it's sad that
it's a sociopath

28:39.843 --> 28:41.470
who's gonna have to point this out to you.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.311
You can't live on an island.
You've already tried.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.860
But you are always gonna
have people in your life, Oliver.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.441
<i>And they will always need you.
Better or worse, baggage and all.</i>

28:53.649 --> 28:56.323
And if you can't accept that,

28:56.526 --> 28:59.245
well, your past is gonna stay your anchor.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.868
- Yeah?
- Mr. Queen,

29:04.076 --> 29:05.168
<i>the marshals are here
to transfer the prisoner.</i>

29:05.369 --> 29:06.791
<i>You said you wanted to know.</i>

29:06.995 --> 29:08.497
Thank you, I'm on my way.

29:09.831 --> 29:13.131
I'm going to ensure that
Chase's prison transfer goes smoothly.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.429
We're very capable people,

29:15.629 --> 29:18.303
and we're gonna find a way
to rescue everyone.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.607
You're not real.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.731
I am as real as your conscience.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.650
Remember? Survive.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.823
My dying wish for you
after I gave my life for yours.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.576
<i>But you squandered my sacrifice,</i>

29:42.781 --> 29:47.332
and now my daughter,
my dear Shado, is dead.

29:50.414 --> 29:53.509
Yao Fei, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

29:53.834 --> 29:55.507
Apologies won't bring her back.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.671
<i>And it won't bring the others back.</i>

29:57.879 --> 29:58.971
Please, stop.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.597
Taiana, Akio, Sara...

30:02.968 --> 30:05.847
Everyone you've lost
over the past five years.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.816
And all of those you have yet to lose.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.190
This isn't real.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.484
It's not real, you're in my head.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.117
And who better
than you knows the truth?

30:21.236 --> 30:22.408
What truth?

30:22.654 --> 30:28.127
That those closest to you
are fated to suffer for your sins.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.549
But you can save them, Oliver.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.880
By making the same sacrifice

30:40.088 --> 30:41.305
I made for you.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.430
I love what you've done
with the place.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.106
You got shipping containers
as nice as this on Earth-2?

30:50.349 --> 30:53.478
Everything's exactly the same
as it is here, Dad.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.364
Don't call me that.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.111
You're Laurel, but you're not my Laurel.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.036
- Is that too tight?
- You care?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.035
You think this isn't hard for me?

31:05.364 --> 31:07.787
Doesn't much look like it.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.703
I owe my freedom to Adrian Chase.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.544
In exchange, I give him my help

31:14.748 --> 31:17.046
and his assurance that you won't get hurt.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.965
Chase's assurance?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.923
My Laurel wouldn't be that stupid.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.553
I know.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.645
You loved her, and I know you lost her,

31:29.763 --> 31:32.687
and I know how
it makes you feel seeing me.

31:33.850 --> 31:34.976
You've got no idea.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.743
Don't worry, sir. If custody's threatened,
we have orders to shoot on sight.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.497
Tick-tock.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.670
You're not pulling my strings
anymore, Adrian.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.264
At least you admit that I have been.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.931
Hey, but just so that we're clear,

32:09.136 --> 32:11.889
the moment I get on that transfer chopper,

32:12.097 --> 32:14.941
my friends have orders to kill yours.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.356
We'll see about that.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.240
Think you're about to get a phone call.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.683
<i>Hello?</i>

32:53.430 --> 32:54.397
<i>Hello?</i>

32:54.598 --> 32:56.726
<i>Somebody help me.</i>

32:57.267 --> 32:58.564
<i>Please help me.</i>

33:00.312 --> 33:01.734
<i>Please, please.</i>

33:26.588 --> 33:27.555
I need the van!

33:27.756 --> 33:29.053
Sir, what are you doing? Stop!

33:42.103 --> 33:43.355
He took your son, didn't he?

33:44.606 --> 33:45.653
How'd you know?

33:45.857 --> 33:48.076
Like minds. Here.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.216
Something funny, nut-bag?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.886
Not yet, but soon.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.018
See what I mean?

34:35.156 --> 34:36.829
This would be easier
if we could kill them.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.335
Then it's not gonna be easy.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.255
<i>We're compromised.
Take the prisoner out!</i>

34:45.917 --> 34:46.839
They're targeting Chase.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.302
Go, I'll cover you.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.179
Really!

35:08.023 --> 35:09.149
Chase!

35:10.025 --> 35:10.992
Thanks for the assist, pal.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.489
Where is my son?

35:12.694 --> 35:14.162
No! No! That wasn't the deal, Oliver.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.989
That wasn't the deal.
I said you let me go,

35:16.197 --> 35:17.540
and I keep your loved ones safe.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.205
But I'm not gone yet.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.050
Why did you involve William?

35:32.797 --> 35:34.299
That's my boy.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.887
He's an innocent.

35:38.303 --> 35:42.399
So was my wife, man, but you involved her.

35:44.059 --> 35:47.313
I already told you, Oliver,
everyone that you care about suffers.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.739
Everyone.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.072
I'll see you on the boat.

36:17.092 --> 36:21.097
Okay, Chase's helicopter flew to an
abandoned airfield in Dawn Valley, Utah.

36:21.346 --> 36:23.724
Then five minutes later,
this aircraft took off from the same field

36:23.932 --> 36:26.060
at a vector of two-seven-zero.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.611
Due west.
That would take him back to Star City.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.113
Chase seems smarter than that.

36:30.355 --> 36:33.529
I'm trying to track this plane,
but it's not easy without Felicity.

36:33.733 --> 36:36.202
Back before the Undertaking,
some of my associates,

36:36.403 --> 36:39.282
especially those who were
on the wrong end of your bow,

36:39.531 --> 36:41.374
thought that The Hood had computer skills.

36:41.616 --> 36:44.460
I had good hardware
and a specific purpose.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.879
Chase turned off the transponder
on the plane.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.458
Luckily, Felicity has access
to a keyhole satellite

36:49.708 --> 36:53.133
that can track the heat signature
of any aircraft in the world. Which...

36:53.712 --> 36:54.634
Impressive.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.631
Just got lucky.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.933
- You expecting someone?
- Yes, I am.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.101
Because Chase is working with

37:00.301 --> 37:02.303
at least Black Siren, Evelyn Sharp,

37:02.554 --> 37:05.433
Talia al Ghul, and whatever army
she's currently controlling.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.313
So you called in reinforcements?

37:07.475 --> 37:10.775
If I wasn't such a confident individual,
my ego might be bruised.

37:10.979 --> 37:14.153
Malcolm, your ego is what I'm going to
need you to keep in check.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.654
<i>Why'?</i>

37:15.900 --> 37:17.447
Who did you reach out to?

37:21.948 --> 37:22.995
Husband.

37:26.745 --> 37:30.249
Mr. Merlyn.
I assume you still have no title.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.337
- No.
- Malcolm...

37:32.500 --> 37:34.844
- I will not work with her.
- I told you.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.471
I'd sooner slice her throat.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.968
Try to, you mean.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.847
Malcolm, you said you were willing to do
whatever it takes to get Thea back.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.854
So, here we are!

37:45.597 --> 37:46.689
Fine.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.979
But does she know?

37:53.855 --> 37:55.152
Know what, Mr. Merlyn?

37:55.356 --> 37:57.529
One of the people we are up against

37:58.526 --> 37:59.527
is your sister.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.332
Nyssa, I wanted to explain it
to you in person.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.620
We have Chase at C-one-thirty.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.625
Flew out over the coast
banked southerly 12 degrees, which...

38:12.832 --> 38:14.049
Which means...

38:14.209 --> 38:15.381
What does it mean?

38:22.050 --> 38:23.222
I know where he's taking them.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.190
Why would your adversary
bring them here?

38:34.145 --> 38:36.819
For that matter,
how did he even know about this place?

38:37.315 --> 38:38.407
Talia.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.576
She researched me.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.412
Probably told Chase everything.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.742
Ironic.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.077
When I was a little girl,
my father told me to visit this place.

38:51.913 --> 38:53.415
It's where I found Sara.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.259
Please, don't.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.020
I'm sorry that I have to.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.231
But it's better for everyone.

39:22.735 --> 39:25.784
This is the only way
to make sure that...

39:28.074 --> 39:31.294
That I don't infect everyone that I love.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.629
But we love you in return for it, Ollie.

39:36.457 --> 39:37.800
We need you home.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.466
<i>Please come home to me, Ollie.</i>

39:40.962 --> 39:43.306
To Thea, and your mother.

39:45.592 --> 39:46.969
Please, we need you.

39:49.304 --> 39:53.025
If you don't, then your father
and my sister will have died for nothing.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.015
- Diggle! Felicity!
- We're okay, you okay?

40:26.341 --> 40:27.968
We're fine.
Little north of pissed off, though.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.178
- Rene, Dinah, where are they?
- Not with us.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.190
Relax.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.486
Enjoy the weather.

40:40.688 --> 40:41.735
Miss Smoak.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.702
Anybody ever tell you
how much you suck at life?

40:46.861 --> 40:48.033
No.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.197
Care to be the first?

40:49.405 --> 40:50.657
Why are we here?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.576
So you recognize this place?

40:55.536 --> 40:56.913
That's good.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.044
Oliver's gonna come for us.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.217
Yeah, I'm counting on it, sis.

41:06.673 --> 41:09.552
Sounds like Chase is using us as bait.
He wants to draw Oliver out.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.560
Numbers aren't exactly in his favor.

41:11.761 --> 41:12.853
He faced worse odds before.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.055
Yeah.

41:14.597 --> 41:15.723
With the help of you and John.

41:16.516 --> 41:18.109
Roy and Laurel. Thea.

41:18.393 --> 41:19.360
The rest of us.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.937
Curtis is right,
Oliver can't do this alone.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.415
I need your help.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.885
Hey, kid.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.268
I'm glad you came back.
