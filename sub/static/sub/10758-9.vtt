WEBVTT

00:08.330 --> 00:11.417
A gold-leaf candle snuffer?

00:12.209 --> 00:16.547
My, what a spendthrift
this Charles X was.

00:16.714 --> 00:18.590
Of course I want you to bid
on it for me, Greg.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.884
Now, start waving your paddle.

00:21.427 --> 00:23.387
- Hey.
- Oh, Roz, you got my message.

00:23.554 --> 00:25.055
Yeah, said you had good news.

00:25.222 --> 00:26.265
- Yes.
- What's up?

00:26.432 --> 00:28.225
More importantly, what's down.

00:28.392 --> 00:30.227
Oh, fun. Word play.

00:30.394 --> 00:33.021
No, no, no, the ratings are out
for KACL's first six months

00:33.188 --> 00:34.690
<i>of All Salsa Radio.</i>

00:35.315 --> 00:39.111
- And they were lousy?
- They aspire to lousy.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.488
So they'll be looking
for a new format.

00:41.697 --> 00:45.659
- Better yet, an old format.
- Think they're gonna bring us back?

00:45.867 --> 00:49.204
- That's the scuttlebutt on the street.
- Oh, this is great. Aren't you thrilled?

00:49.413 --> 00:52.833
I'd be shouting it from the rooftops
if I weren't saving my instrument.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.334
- Oh, thank you.
- May I help you?

00:54.501 --> 00:55.877
Non-fat cap.

00:56.044 --> 00:57.295
I haven't seen you before.

00:57.462 --> 01:00.340
- I'm Roz. This is Frasier.
- Colette.

01:00.507 --> 01:02.509
Your mother was a fan
of the great French novelist

01:02.676 --> 01:04.970
and raconteur,
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette.

01:05.679 --> 01:07.305
Okay. Yeah.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.767
Hey, guys, you won't...

01:13.103 --> 01:14.312
Any more like you at home?

01:14.521 --> 01:17.232
- No.
- Good, we'll have privacy.

01:19.568 --> 01:21.862
- Short drip.
- Colette.

01:22.654 --> 01:24.614
- Hey, you guys see these numbers?
- Yes.

01:24.781 --> 01:27.033
<i>- Salsa Radio is in el dumper-acha.
- See?</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:30.287
KACL is gonna be on their knees
begging us to come back to work.

01:30.453 --> 01:31.997
You know that lady
from the temp agency

01:32.163 --> 01:33.707
who's saying I have a bad attitude?

01:33.915 --> 01:35.792
I can't wait to tell
that bean-counting fathead

01:35.959 --> 01:37.377
where she can put her time sheet.

01:37.585 --> 01:39.796
I'm quitting on the way home.

01:39.963 --> 01:42.090
What? Did you say something?

01:42.298 --> 01:44.717
No, no, never mind.

01:45.802 --> 01:49.139
I better cancel my lecture next week.
Can't be out of town if I'm gonna work.

01:49.305 --> 01:52.225
- No, no...
- Is everything all right, Colette?

01:52.392 --> 01:55.019
- Oh, I hate this.
- What?

01:55.228 --> 01:57.355
Well, I overhear things.
I'm not trying to.

01:57.522 --> 01:59.649
It just happens
when you're a waitress.

01:59.857 --> 02:01.693
And you overheard something
about KACL?

02:01.901 --> 02:03.528
<i>They're not dropping Salsa.</i>

02:03.736 --> 02:05.655
- What?
- How do you know that?

02:05.863 --> 02:08.324
Well, the station owner
was in this morning, and he said:

02:08.491 --> 02:12.203
"It's my station. I like salsa music,
and I'm sticking with it."

02:12.370 --> 02:14.122
But that could mean anything.

02:15.873 --> 02:17.834
I knew I shouldn't have
gotten my hopes up.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.627
This stinks! This is total B.S.!

02:19.836 --> 02:22.380
Oh, what are you so upset
about, Bulldog? You've got a job.

02:22.547 --> 02:23.965
Not anymore.

02:24.173 --> 02:26.801
I got canned last Friday
for saying something on the air.

02:27.009 --> 02:29.178
I was talking with this golfer chick

02:29.387 --> 02:31.889
who said she wants
to enter the Women's Open.

02:32.056 --> 02:34.225
Like I'm supposed
to leave that alone.

02:40.564 --> 02:42.733
I'm starting to think
we're never going back to work.

02:42.942 --> 02:44.902
They can't stay
with a failing format forever.

02:45.111 --> 02:47.697
I guarantee you, in three months,
if the numbers are this bad,

02:47.863 --> 02:49.073
they'll have to make a change.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.200
Three months is an eternity.

02:51.367 --> 02:55.162
My rent's gone up.
The baby stuff cost a fortune.

02:55.371 --> 02:57.081
I stopped buying Alice
those pink headbands

02:57.248 --> 02:59.125
for little girls whose hair
hasn't come in yet.

02:59.291 --> 03:01.877
Now, when we go out,
I just call her Howard.

03:02.545 --> 03:05.339
Well, Roz, you know what,
if things have gotten that tight,

03:05.506 --> 03:07.842
let me lend you some money
to tide you over.

03:08.050 --> 03:10.302
- Oh, that's very sweet, but I couldn't.
- No, please.

03:10.511 --> 03:12.638
It's not a hardship for me.
I'll be fine for the next three months.

03:12.846 --> 03:15.641
I don't know. I'm not sure I feel
comfortable taking money from you.

03:15.849 --> 03:18.811
Try putting your hair in a bun.
That used to help Lilith.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.689
Now, how much can I give you?

03:21.855 --> 03:22.898
Fifteen hundred?

03:23.065 --> 03:26.652
- I mean, I wouldn't ask for so much...
- No, no, none of my business.

03:26.860 --> 03:29.196
You can just pay me back
whenever you'd like.

03:29.363 --> 03:32.324
This is your money to do with
as you see fit.

03:32.533 --> 03:34.076
There we are.

03:34.243 --> 03:35.327
Thank you.

03:35.494 --> 03:37.162
Oh, Roz, please,
don't even mention it.

03:37.371 --> 03:39.957
Makes me feel good to share
my good fortune with someone.

03:40.124 --> 03:41.834
I just got a call
from my antique scout.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.419
He's found a gilded candle snuffer
that the Seattle Museum

03:44.586 --> 03:47.881
would pay a pretty penny for
to have in their collection.

03:49.216 --> 03:51.009
I hate her.

03:57.557 --> 03:59.601
Look, I'm sorry, Niles.
I have no idea where it is.

03:59.768 --> 04:02.104
- I'm not even sure I own one.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

04:02.270 --> 04:04.022
Dad, have you seen
Frasier's frittata pan?

04:05.232 --> 04:08.193
Hi. Marty Crane.
I don't believe we've met.

04:10.737 --> 04:12.614
Dad, what on earth are you doing?

04:12.781 --> 04:14.408
Oh, Eddie's woozy.

04:14.991 --> 04:17.786
There's this vicious blue jay
on the terrace who keeps teasing him.

04:17.952 --> 04:20.747
Then Eddie goes chasing after him
and slams into that glass door.

04:20.914 --> 04:23.250
And this bird just struts around,
big as you please,

04:23.416 --> 04:26.336
laughing that snooty bird laugh.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.673
Snooty bird laugh?

04:30.298 --> 04:32.259
Yeah, like that.

04:35.178 --> 04:37.931
I wanna put stickums on the door
so that Eddie remembers it's glass.

04:38.098 --> 04:39.432
Oh, yes, Dad, by all means.

04:39.599 --> 04:42.018
Let's add rainbow decals
to the nose prints

04:42.185 --> 04:44.396
and the bits of fur
that already festoon it.

04:44.562 --> 04:47.399
You're kind of grouchy for somebody
who just got his job back.

04:47.607 --> 04:49.859
Well, maybe that's because I'm not
getting my job back.

04:50.068 --> 04:51.820
What happened?
You said it was a sure thing.

04:51.986 --> 04:53.029
Well, it wasn't.

04:53.196 --> 04:55.824
<i>I spoke with Bebe. She confirmed
that they're keeping Salsa.</i>

04:56.032 --> 04:58.201
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, well, don't despair, Dad.

04:58.409 --> 05:00.912
There are other jobs.
Bebe told me that I'm on the short list

05:01.079 --> 05:03.915
for the voice
of Chester "the Yummy Nut" Squirrel.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.420
All right, don't anyone go out
in this weather.

05:09.587 --> 05:12.840
I am so soaked,
my dress is pasted right onto me.

05:13.049 --> 05:16.177
It's a good thing I had this coat
in the trunk.

05:16.386 --> 05:18.888
Yes, that was lucky.
Let me take it for you.

05:19.055 --> 05:22.975
No, it's all right. I'll keep it on
for the moment. Thanks.

05:23.142 --> 05:24.769
Here you are, Dr. Crane.

05:24.936 --> 05:28.523
I stopped off at the Trianon Day Spa
and picked up your papaya exfoliant

05:28.731 --> 05:30.733
<i>- and neck cream pour L' Homme.
- Thanks, Daphne.</i>

05:30.942 --> 05:33.861
I wouldn't have sent you out in this
weather if it weren't an emergency.

05:34.862 --> 05:36.739
Oh, by the way,
I saw Roz down at the spa,

05:36.906 --> 05:39.367
having herself
an all-day beauty treatment.

05:41.035 --> 05:42.161
Now, that's strange.

05:42.370 --> 05:43.537
Why?

05:43.704 --> 05:46.123
Well, Roz has been
a little cash-poor lately.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.751
In fact, I gave her a loan myself
this morning.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.336
Then she heads down
to the Trianon.

05:50.503 --> 05:52.588
I have half a mind to have a word
with her about it.

05:52.755 --> 05:54.924
Bad idea. If you loaned her
that money, it's hers now.

05:55.091 --> 05:57.093
It's none of your business
what she does with it.

05:57.301 --> 05:59.553
- That's exactly what I told her. Still...
- Trust me.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.390
More friendships have been ruined
because of something like this.

06:02.598 --> 06:04.475
Smartest thing you can do
is never bring it up.

06:04.683 --> 06:05.851
Well, I'm aware of that, Dad.

06:06.018 --> 06:09.021
It's just that she must have gone
straight from the cafe down to the spa.

06:09.188 --> 06:10.481
Don't you think that's odd?

06:10.689 --> 06:14.652
Well, not when you stack it up
against a man who uses neck cream.

06:20.532 --> 06:24.078
Before you mock this product,
you might recall you went to that spa.

06:24.703 --> 06:26.246
- What?
- Don't you remember?

06:26.413 --> 06:29.416
Two years ago, for your birthday,
I gave you that special gift certificate

06:29.583 --> 06:32.211
for you and Sherry
to have a day of indulgence.

06:32.419 --> 06:33.504
You told me you used it.

06:33.712 --> 06:35.672
Oh, yeah. Right.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.302
Remind us, Dad,
what treatments did you have?

06:40.511 --> 06:43.222
Oh, we did
the whole shooting match.

06:43.388 --> 06:44.723
First they rubbed us all over,

06:44.890 --> 06:48.477
and then they washed us down
with this liniment oil.

06:48.644 --> 06:53.732
And then they hit us
with those hickory sticks.

06:57.194 --> 07:00.614
You've heard us talk about it enough,
you'd be able to bluff better than that.

07:00.822 --> 07:02.658
You'd be surprised
at what I don't listen to.

07:03.533 --> 07:05.369
I'm sorry, Niles.
I hope you're not mad.

07:05.577 --> 07:06.912
Mad? No, I'm delighted.

07:07.079 --> 07:08.705
If you still have the certificate,
we can go together.

07:08.914 --> 07:10.165
No, I don't think so.

07:10.374 --> 07:11.625
Oh, please, I need this.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.335
You know,
a spa's just not my speed.

07:13.502 --> 07:16.338
I just keep picturing myself
standing over some drain

07:16.505 --> 07:19.174
being hosed down
like some old circus animal.

07:19.341 --> 07:22.511
But, Dad, I can't afford
this sort of thing for myself anymore.

07:22.677 --> 07:25.722
I'd go without you,
but the certificate's in your name.

07:26.264 --> 07:28.725
- Please?
- Oh, all right.

07:28.934 --> 07:29.976
Oh, great.

07:30.143 --> 07:33.021
I'm gonna call and make a reservation
before you change your mind.

07:33.772 --> 07:35.315
And what are you smirking at?

07:35.482 --> 07:37.776
Oh, I'm just musing
about the timeless moments

07:37.943 --> 07:39.361
that bind a father to son.

07:39.569 --> 07:43.281
A game of catch,
a trip to a little fishing hole,

07:43.448 --> 07:45.700
a shared rainforest mud facial.

07:51.373 --> 07:53.666
Oh, Niles, I thought today
was your spa day.

07:53.833 --> 07:56.419
It is. I'm on my way,
and I need it now more than ever.

07:56.586 --> 07:57.796
Last night at the Shangri-La,

07:57.962 --> 08:00.632
- the most scandalous thing happened.
- Now's not the best time.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.551
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there.
I'll have...

08:03.760 --> 08:05.136
A non-fat cappuccino?

08:05.762 --> 08:06.971
Good guess.

08:07.180 --> 08:08.765
No, I've waited on you before.

08:08.973 --> 08:11.142
Oh, I don't think so.
I'm very observant.

08:11.351 --> 08:13.102
Anyway...

08:14.103 --> 08:17.315
I was invited to a housewarming party
for a new arrival, Stewey.

08:17.941 --> 08:19.984
I hadn't been there two minutes
when I heard a pop.

08:20.151 --> 08:23.321
Looked up to see the '81
Chateau Haut-Brion I brought

08:23.488 --> 08:25.239
being decanted
into a punch bowl of sangria,

08:25.406 --> 08:28.159
canned fruit and erotic ice cubes.

08:29.369 --> 08:31.537
I haven't been so depressed
since Maris started seeing

08:31.704 --> 08:32.914
- What's-His-Name.
- Schenkman.

08:33.081 --> 08:34.624
Thank you.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.001
Hey, guys.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.294
- Oh, Roz.
- Hello, Roz.

08:39.462 --> 08:40.962
Shopping really takes it out of you.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.883
Really? Stocking up on supplies
for baby Alice?

08:44.049 --> 08:48.012
Oh, no. It's mama's turn today.
I'll be back in a minute.

08:48.512 --> 08:51.515
Bidwell's? My God,
isn't that a little pricey?

08:51.682 --> 08:53.643
I'll say. It's Maris' favourite store.

08:53.851 --> 08:55.853
They give points for every dollar
you spend there.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.063
One year, she got enough

08:57.229 --> 08:59.607
to have Tony Bennett
come to our house and sing.

09:03.819 --> 09:07.114
Well, at this rate she's gonna go
through that loan in no time.

09:07.281 --> 09:09.366
I'm just wondering
if I should have a talk with her.

09:09.575 --> 09:11.827
I understand your impulse,
but I'm with Dad on this one.

09:11.994 --> 09:13.621
Questioning her about that money,

09:13.788 --> 09:16.957
- it's just going to lead to trouble.
- I'm not sure I agree.

09:17.374 --> 09:19.251
Of course, the entire point
may be moot anyway.

09:19.418 --> 09:21.629
How do I know there's anything
more extravagant in here

09:21.795 --> 09:24.131
- than calendars and socks?
- Don't even think about it.

09:24.298 --> 09:26.800
You know as well as I do
there is absolutely no justification

09:26.967 --> 09:28.302
for going through her bags.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.179
You're right, there isn't.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.514
- Now there is.
- Frasier.

09:32.681 --> 09:36.352
Just shut up and keep a lookout.
God, a cashmere sweater.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.145
Bidwell's private labelled perfume.

09:38.354 --> 09:41.065
- Here she comes.
- What, oh, my keys.

09:41.231 --> 09:44.068
That is the last time I wear
the shoes right out of the store.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.820
My feet are killing me.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.615
I should go. I wanna get down
to the spa before Dad.

09:49.782 --> 09:52.284
He may bridle
when the front desk clerk asks him

09:52.451 --> 09:54.912
if he prefers a man or a woman.

09:58.707 --> 10:01.418
Is that the time? I gotta meet Carol
for lunch at La Goloue.

10:01.627 --> 10:02.836
- La Goloue?
- Yeah.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.756
- Roz, before you go, there's...
- Oh, I know.

10:05.923 --> 10:08.926
If I drop your name, they'll give me
better service. I'll call you later.

10:11.553 --> 10:13.388
- Can I get you anything else?
- Yes, a taxi.

10:13.597 --> 10:15.182
I already called.

10:17.000 --> 10:23.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:25.942 --> 10:27.235
Oh, damn.

10:27.444 --> 10:29.070
Oh, not to worry, Dr. Crane.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.990
- I'll have that spot cleaned up.
- Thank you, Daphne.

10:32.199 --> 10:35.035
Lock up your daughters.
The men are back from the hunt.

10:35.202 --> 10:38.205
Oh, well, boys,
how was your day at the spa?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.707
Fantastic.
You should have seen Dad.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.083
I walked by the serenity room

10:42.250 --> 10:45.587
just as Olga and Sergei
were giving him a full-body sudsing.

10:45.795 --> 10:49.132
I never felt so clean and so dirty
at the same time.

10:50.675 --> 10:53.136
See you later, Dad. Great day.

10:53.303 --> 10:56.348
- All right, how bad was it?
- Mortifying.

10:57.182 --> 10:59.809
First of all, he refused to go nude,
even in the private rooms.

10:59.976 --> 11:03.271
Well, Niles, don't forget,
Dad is of a different generation.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.149
Wearing socks and underpants
and carrying a wallet into a mudbath

11:06.316 --> 11:07.817
is not a generational issue.

11:10.987 --> 11:13.156
If you ever hear me offer
to take Dad to a spa again,

11:13.323 --> 11:16.117
wash out my mouth with jug wine.

11:17.368 --> 11:19.037
Did you ever get your keys
back from Roz?

11:19.203 --> 11:21.039
No, no. Actually, I had to wait
the entire day

11:21.205 --> 11:23.708
before she found them in her bag.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.710
She's on her way over here
right now.

11:25.877 --> 11:28.087
It gives me a chance to talk to her
about her spending.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.882
Frasier, why do you insist
on traipsing into that minefield?

11:31.049 --> 11:34.802
Niles, I don't want to talk
to her about it, I have to.

11:35.011 --> 11:36.721
For God's sake,
at the rate she's spending,

11:36.888 --> 11:39.223
she's gonna be out of money
before we're back to work.

11:39.390 --> 11:42.977
And frankly, I'm just a bit annoyed
with the way she flaunts it in my face.

11:43.186 --> 11:46.606
Expensive lunches.
Needless extravagances.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.650
Frankly, I think the entire thing's
just a bit insensitive, don't you?

11:49.859 --> 11:51.360
Oh, excuse me.

11:51.527 --> 11:56.407
Not to interrupt, but six months ago,
you borrowed $40 from me.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.534
We were at the wine shop,
remember?

11:58.743 --> 12:01.037
You couldn't quite scrape together
enough for a bottle

12:01.203 --> 12:03.914
of your precious
Chateau Mr. Fussy-Pants.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.709
So I lent you the money.

12:06.876 --> 12:09.837
And have I said a peep
about it since? No.

12:10.046 --> 12:13.090
I just sit here,
quietly reusing my tea bags,

12:13.257 --> 12:15.509
while you trundle off
to your private clubs

12:15.676 --> 12:18.137
ordering gourmet this
and imported that.

12:18.345 --> 12:21.140
"Are the cigars Cuban?
Are the tulips Dutch?

12:21.307 --> 12:22.433
Oh, good news.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.728
My personal shopper just found
a dozen antique pudding plates."

12:25.895 --> 12:28.856
Who has 12 people
over for pudding?

12:30.816 --> 12:33.110
So you gave poor Roz
a bit of money.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.820
It hasn't changed your life, has it,

12:34.987 --> 12:38.782
you sherry-swilling,
foie-gras-munching hypocrite?

12:44.288 --> 12:46.999
Daphne, I did repay you.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.043
What?

12:49.251 --> 12:51.295
I paid for that parking ticket.

12:51.462 --> 12:54.006
Fifty dollars, as I recall.
That means you owe me 10.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.926
Oh, right.
Well, I'm glad you said something.

12:58.093 --> 13:01.054
It's not good
to let these things fester.

13:04.391 --> 13:07.811
Niles, I think I'm having
a weird reaction to that spa stuff.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.606
My skin's starting to tingle
and tighten up.

13:10.814 --> 13:13.567
That's the citrus reacting
with your natural oils. It's a good sign.

13:13.775 --> 13:14.985
Well, it doesn't feel so good.

13:15.152 --> 13:18.196
I just scratched my chin
and my eyelid closed.

13:22.242 --> 13:23.618
Oh, that'll be Roz.

13:23.827 --> 13:26.246
Maybe I'll take my leave
before the fur starts to fly.

13:26.413 --> 13:28.457
Oh, Niles, there's not gonna be
any fur flying.

13:28.623 --> 13:31.543
Unless, of course,
she bought one on the way over here.

13:31.710 --> 13:32.753
- Hello, Roz.
- Hey, Niles.

13:32.919 --> 13:34.254
- Roz.
- Are you on your way out?

13:34.421 --> 13:35.881
Yes. Good night.

13:36.506 --> 13:38.884
- Well, here are your keys.
- Oh, thank you, Roz.

13:39.050 --> 13:41.386
We had to turn the whole cafe
inside out looking for them.

13:41.553 --> 13:44.931
I would've been here a lot sooner,
but I stopped to get you something.

13:45.098 --> 13:47.767
Roz, oh, gosh, you know,
you really shouldn't have.

13:47.976 --> 13:50.103
I wanted to. This is just my way
of saying thank you

13:50.270 --> 13:51.354
for how great you've been.

13:51.521 --> 13:53.982
Well, you see,
you really shouldn't have.

13:54.149 --> 13:56.109
I mean, for one thing, it's just...

13:59.112 --> 14:01.740
Gosh, it is lovely, Roz. It's just that...

14:01.948 --> 14:03.867
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

14:04.034 --> 14:06.327
No, that decanter
is not just to say thank you.

14:06.536 --> 14:09.706
It's also to say congratulations.

14:09.914 --> 14:11.624
Station manager
called me half an hour ago.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.418
I made him promise
he'd let me tell you.

14:13.585 --> 14:15.753
The board has reconsidered.
They're changing formats.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.214
- They're bringing us back!
- Oh, Roz, that's fantastic!

14:18.423 --> 14:19.966
We start tomorrow.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.175
What's going on?

14:21.342 --> 14:24.721
Good news, Dad, good news.
We got our jobs back at KACL.

14:24.888 --> 14:27.473
Oh, great. Congratulations.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.602
Well, I thought we'd at least
get a smile out of you.

14:32.228 --> 14:34.564
I thought I was smiling.

14:51.497 --> 14:53.624
This is so great!
We're all back together again!

14:53.791 --> 14:56.544
Hey, Noel, good to see you.
What have you been up to?

14:56.752 --> 14:59.297
Well, actually, I never left.

15:01.632 --> 15:04.218
<i>Adios, Maria.</i>

15:04.385 --> 15:05.636
Hi, everybody!

15:05.803 --> 15:07.596
Roz!

15:07.763 --> 15:09.598
- Oh, God.
- Isn't this the best?

15:09.765 --> 15:16.188
It's so great to see everyone.
Bulldog and Noel, Frasier, you.

15:16.689 --> 15:19.024
God, I didn't think
I'd ever see this place again.

15:19.692 --> 15:22.695
It's like we're soldiers coming back
from the war.

15:24.738 --> 15:26.198
I'm home!

15:26.657 --> 15:29.243
Well, you know, as much as I'd like
to continue the celebration,

15:29.410 --> 15:31.745
in three minutes, we have a show.
Come on, Roz, let's go!

15:35.124 --> 15:38.335
Oh, God. Noel?

15:38.502 --> 15:42.673
Oh, I just wanted to say
I missed you most of all, Roz.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.508
Oh, well, thanks, Noel.
That's so sweet.

15:44.675 --> 15:46.927
Yes, that certainly is sweet, Noel.
Off you go.

15:47.094 --> 15:50.014
Me? Nothing much has changed.

15:50.222 --> 15:51.724
Still living with my mom,

15:51.890 --> 15:55.394
still working
on that Klingon-to-English dictionary.

15:55.602 --> 15:57.896
Noel, how do you say goodbye
in Klingon?

15:58.105 --> 16:00.983
Well, it depends.
If you're talking to a superior officer...

16:01.191 --> 16:03.152
- Noel!
- Krish-Krush.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.779
I am so thrilled to be back.

16:05.946 --> 16:07.406
Oh, God, so am I, Roz.

16:07.573 --> 16:09.908
You know what?
I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night.

16:10.075 --> 16:12.870
I put the time to good use. I composed
a speech to open the show.

16:13.078 --> 16:14.121
Oh, that's great.

16:14.288 --> 16:16.123
You know,
as I was falling asleep last night,

16:16.290 --> 16:19.751
it occurred to me that you wanted
to talk to me about something.

16:20.335 --> 16:22.587
Right. Right. Oh, well, you know,

16:22.754 --> 16:27.801
I just had a little bone to pick with you.
But it's gone by the wayside now.

16:27.968 --> 16:29.886
- Are you sure?
- Oh, absolutely.

16:30.053 --> 16:31.972
You know how things are
when you're out of work.

16:32.139 --> 16:34.015
You just get a little crazy
about little stuff.

16:34.182 --> 16:36.393
Oh, tell me about it.
I mean, the money stuff alone...

16:36.601 --> 16:38.228
- Well, as a matter of fact...
- What?

16:38.395 --> 16:40.939
No, no, no,
it's just not an issue anymore, Roz.

16:41.148 --> 16:42.858
Now, come on.

16:43.024 --> 16:47.654
Well, all right, it's just that I thought
the way you were spending money

16:47.821 --> 16:49.281
was a little unwise.

16:49.865 --> 16:55.370
You know, spa days,
expensive lunches, Bidwell's perfume.

16:55.537 --> 16:58.832
I just thought, you know,
you were unemployed.

16:59.332 --> 17:02.711
But, you know what?
You're employed now, so there it is.

17:02.877 --> 17:05.588
End of subject.
I won't even bring it up again.

17:05.755 --> 17:08.925
I never told you
I bought that perfume.

17:10.050 --> 17:11.428
Well, I...

17:11.594 --> 17:14.431
You didn't have to.
I can smell it on you.

17:14.638 --> 17:16.015
I'm not wearing any.

17:16.516 --> 17:17.934
You're kidding.

17:18.101 --> 17:20.854
My goodness, is that you? Well, then,
you should sweat into bottles.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.564
We got a show to do.

17:23.606 --> 17:24.941
The only way you could know that

17:25.108 --> 17:28.444
is if you were looking through
my shopping bag... The keys.

17:28.653 --> 17:31.614
- Roz, we really should be setting up.
- I can't believe this.

17:31.823 --> 17:35.285
You were searching through my bags?
What, is this about the loan?

17:35.451 --> 17:36.703
All right, fine.

17:36.911 --> 17:40.623
I gave you $1500 and suddenly,
you were off on a spending spree.

17:40.832 --> 17:42.834
Excuse me,
but weren't you the one that said

17:43.001 --> 17:44.669
I could spend it any way I wanted?

17:44.877 --> 17:46.921
I just thought you were gonna be
more responsible.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.840
Oh, so now I'm irresponsible.

17:49.048 --> 17:51.300
No, no, I'm just saying that a woman
in your situation...

17:51.467 --> 17:52.593
What situation?

17:52.802 --> 17:54.178
Oh, I know what this is all about.

17:54.345 --> 17:56.055
- My baby.
- Roz...

17:56.222 --> 17:59.142
- That's what this irresponsible stuff...
- No, that is not what I meant!

17:59.308 --> 18:01.811
Well, listen, obviously,
I am not to be trusted

18:01.978 --> 18:04.689
with your precious money,
so I'm paying you back.

18:04.897 --> 18:09.527
And not that it's any of your business,
but Carol took me out to La Galoue.

18:09.735 --> 18:11.821
And my mother gave me
a day at the spa.

18:12.029 --> 18:14.156
And those shoes were a store credit.

18:14.323 --> 18:16.075
Oh, and I bought the perfume.

18:16.283 --> 18:19.787
Well, that was just for me
because I wanted it.

18:20.705 --> 18:23.708
Roz, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to say any of those things.

18:23.916 --> 18:27.044
- Too late.
- I can't stand to have you mad at me.

18:27.253 --> 18:30.589
Look, let me take you to dinner tonight.
We can discuss it after work, all right?

18:30.756 --> 18:32.007
- You're on.
- Thank you.

18:32.216 --> 18:34.969
No, you're on in five seconds.

18:42.059 --> 18:44.061
Good afternoon, Seattle.

18:44.228 --> 18:48.023
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
and we're back.

18:49.066 --> 18:51.568
But don't worry.
I may have been gone a while,

18:51.735 --> 18:55.698
but I think I can remember
how all these knobs and buttons work.

18:57.825 --> 19:00.577
I see they've moved the cough button.

19:01.036 --> 19:04.331
Well, anyway, I composed
some thoughts last night

19:04.498 --> 19:08.127
about what the show
has meant to me these last years

19:08.293 --> 19:13.298
and, well, I'd like to share it
with you now.

19:13.507 --> 19:15.968
I realised I have a lot
to feel grateful for.

19:16.134 --> 19:20.597
Grateful for my listeners
who trusted me with their problems.

19:21.431 --> 19:26.144
And grateful for the person
whom I most trust.

19:26.311 --> 19:30.732
It's not an exaggeration to say I put my
career in this woman's hands every day

19:31.692 --> 19:33.860
and she never lets me down.

19:34.361 --> 19:40.033
She shoulders many responsibilities
here and in her personal life

19:40.200 --> 19:44.704
with a grace and skill that I admire
more than she'll ever know.

19:46.665 --> 19:49.501
I am proud to call her my friend.

19:49.668 --> 19:50.919
My producer, Roz Doyle.

19:54.130 --> 19:56.550
Well, now, on to the show.

19:56.716 --> 20:01.096
And if I'm a bit rusty,
I hope you'll forgive me.

20:02.722 --> 20:05.433
After all, to err is human.

20:07.268 --> 20:10.563
- I hope you'll look into your hearts...
- All right, Frasier, you're forgiven.

20:10.730 --> 20:12.190
Oh, good. All right.

20:12.357 --> 20:14.567
Well, we've got a quick word
from our sponsor

20:14.734 --> 20:16.820
and then we'll be back
with your calls.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.488
Back after this.

20:19.531 --> 20:20.949
Thanks, Frasier.

20:21.116 --> 20:23.952
- I'm sorry I got so mad.
- Oh, Roz, you had every right to.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.830
How can I think you would squander
the money I gave you that way?

20:26.996 --> 20:29.332
- You'd never be that irresponsible.
- Well, I wouldn't.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.584
If it was on your mind,
I'm glad you brought it up.

20:31.751 --> 20:33.711
I like that we can be honest
with each other.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.171
I like that too.

20:35.380 --> 20:37.715
And I'm so touched
that you stayed up all night last night

20:37.882 --> 20:39.509
and wrote all those things about me.

20:40.093 --> 20:41.469
I meant every word.

20:43.554 --> 20:45.765
Hey, Dr. Crane, great speech.

20:45.932 --> 20:48.518
- I loved what you said about Roz.
- Oh, thank you, Noel.

20:48.726 --> 20:51.020
Hey, Bulldog,
can you lend me some money?

20:51.187 --> 20:54.649
- Sure. How much?
- Fifteen hundred. I wrote a bad cheque.

20:54.857 --> 20:57.026
Hey, wait a minute.
There's nothing in here about Roz.

20:57.193 --> 20:58.236
Noel, put that down.

20:58.402 --> 21:00.404
"Like Napoleon's triumphant return
from Elba..."?

21:00.613 --> 21:02.740
Krish-Krush! Krish-Krush!
