05:59.150 --> 06:00.322
Joey!

06:18.920 --> 06:20.046
Joey!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.111
Joey!

06:38.231 --> 06:41.952
Just for that, I'm not taking
you to the carnival on Saturday.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.072
And while I'm there tonight,
you think about this.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.826
I'm gonna get even with you.
You're not gonna know when or where,

06:48.950 --> 06:52.204
but I'm gonna get you so bad
you're never gonna forget it!

06:52.329 --> 06:53.797
Never!

06:54.456 --> 06:56.049
Never!

07:15.685 --> 07:18.359
'The bride of Frankenstein!'

07:46.216 --> 07:48.310
What time is it, Daddy?

07:49.260 --> 07:52.730
It's after nine. Listen, I don't know
where you're going tonight,

07:52.847 --> 07:54.941
but I don't want you to go
to that damn carnival.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.277
It's the same one
that went through Fairfield last year,

07:57.394 --> 08:01.240
when they found the bodies
of those two little girls in Parsons Creek.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.074
I don't see why you wanna
waste your time

08:03.191 --> 08:05.990
with a guy who works
in a filling station to begin with.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.455
It's our first date, Mum,
we're not getting married.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.200
Can't even pick you up
at a decent hour.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.077
Did you hear what I said
about that carnival?

08:14.244 --> 08:17.874
- They needed dental charts to identify...
- I heard you, Daddy.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.421
Where are you going tonight?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.214
Well?
Answer your father.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.261
We're going to the movies.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.683
Liar.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.895
It's Buzz.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.394
Does he have to wake up
the whole damn neighbourhood?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.486
Bye.

08:45.525 --> 08:48.529
You've got 10 seconds
to get up to bed, young man

08:50.572 --> 08:52.199
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.206
I got off work a little late.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.499
It's OK. Listen...

08:57.620 --> 09:01.545
How would you like to go to the movies
tonight instead of the carnival?

09:01.666 --> 09:02.838
Movies? What for?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.929
It's the same carnival that
went through Fairfield County

09:06.046 --> 09:07.298
when they had all that trouble.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.559
Terrific! Maybe we'll get
a little action around here.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.474
- Terrific?
- Come on! You're not afraid, are you?

09:14.429 --> 09:17.478
No, I'm not afraid to go,
I just don't feel like it.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.899
Besides, I promised my father
that we were going to the movies.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.565
Forget about your old man.
He's just trying to bum the evening.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.947
How can you say that?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.783
You don't even know my father.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.625
Look, it's late.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.292
Aren't we supposed to pick up
your friends Liz and Richie?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.209
Hey, loosen up, will you?

10:04.020 --> 10:05.613
So, go on.

10:06.731 --> 10:10.861
Just show me where the electrical
outlet is, and I'll set the act up.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.247
Well, the MC says,
“I don't understand.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.534
"What do you need an outlet for?"

10:19.786 --> 10:22.585
The duck trainer looks at him
and says,

10:22.705 --> 10:26.460
"I need to plug the hotplate in.
You think this duck dances by himself?“

10:28.294 --> 10:32.845
Amy, the duck doesn't actually dance,
it burns its feet on the hotplate.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.260
Earth to Mars. Come in, Amy.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.357
So, Richie,
you still in school or what?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.817
Yeah, one more year.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.112
- Going to college?
- If I get in.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.902
Will you loosen up?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.445
- Enjoy it?
- Yeah, really terrific.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.034
You really shouldn't be
so hard on the boy.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.499
Sometimes
I just lose my temper.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.208
Especially
when you're drinking.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.626
Don't start about my drinking.
I only had a couple this evening.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.584
Besides, Joey really
scared Amy tonight.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.507
And he thought she was going
to take him to the carnival.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.130
Well, I'm glad they went
to the movies instead.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.600
I don't like a young girl like Amy
hanging around a travelling carnival,

11:15.758 --> 11:19.137
especially a travelling carnival
like that one.

11:19.262 --> 11:23.108
No harm in taking Joey
with us on Saturday afternoon.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.229
I guess not. Why don't you go
upstairs and tell him we'll go together?

11:27.353 --> 11:29.731
No, I'll tell him in the morning.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.145
What's the rush?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.110
Hey, listen.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.610
Did I do something wrong?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.409
Huh?

12:16.486 --> 12:17.863
Hmm?

12:19.197 --> 12:21.871
Well, I get the feeling
you're mad at me.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.212
I'm not mad at you, no.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.881
Yes, you are.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.261
Well, if it's what I said
about your old man...

12:37.382 --> 12:40.511
Your father...
I'm sorry, OK?

12:44.055 --> 12:47.559
I don't think they're hitting it off.
Did they have a fight or something?

12:47.684 --> 12:51.439
Of course they're hitting it off.
Buzz is a terrific guy.

12:53.189 --> 12:58.366
You know, Richie, when you're stoned,
Charles Manson's a terrific guy.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.386
What do you say we just start over?

13:18.589 --> 13:23.516
Hey, come on, you don't want to spoil
Liz and Richie's evening.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.561
- Do you?
- No. No, I guess not.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.148
Friends?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.607
Friends.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.358
Buzz is cute!

14:18.483 --> 14:20.952
Oh, excuse me.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.413
Is he a weakling,
or is he a Samson?

14:23.529 --> 14:27.124
Can he make the grade?
Come on, don't take all day, my boy!

14:27.241 --> 14:30.040
Is he a weakling or a Samson?
What'll he do?

14:33.915 --> 14:37.260
Hey, we got a winner here.
Y'all need a look. OK.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.594
Not too bad.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.180
I thought he was too skinny.
Here, pick a prize.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.299
Is that all I get?

14:43.424 --> 14:44.767
You want this?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.636
OK. Who's next?

14:46.761 --> 14:49.105
- You'll take care of it?
- Yeah.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.317
Hey, tubby!
Try to work off some of that fat.

15:00.483 --> 15:04.533
You have to picture
the little duck's orange beak

15:04.654 --> 15:07.578
just hopping round like it's dancing.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.501
I get it. I get the joke, OK?

15:10.618 --> 15:11.995
- You do?
- Yes.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.840
Whoa!

15:40.731 --> 15:41.778
Get it!

15:43.526 --> 15:44.903
Richie!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.582
So, what do you think?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.086
I think he's nice.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.549
Nice? God, I think he's a hunk.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.797
He is an absolute pistol.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.767
You know,
if you play your cards right,

16:08.885 --> 16:11.729
you may not have to spend
the rest of your life a virgin.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.231
- Liz?
- What?

16:13.347 --> 16:15.725
- Fuck up.
- Stop!

16:18.311 --> 16:19.688
Sorry.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.072
God is watching you.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.863
I beg your pardon?

16:31.532 --> 16:34.502
He hears everything.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.672
I hate people who preach.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.966
Especially in bathrooms!

16:46.714 --> 16:50.389
Anyway, I don't know
what you're saving it for.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.604
Who says I'm saving it?

16:54.805 --> 16:58.435
God is watching you.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.214
Hey, kid!
What are you up to?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.251
What are you doing around here?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.463
You want a lift?

17:27.380 --> 17:30.634
Huh? You wanna come for a ride?

17:41.978 --> 17:46.575
Alive, alive, alive.

17:46.732 --> 17:52.034
These are all creatures of God,
ladies and gentlemen, not man.

17:52.154 --> 17:56.660
They are authentic, and they are alive.

17:56.784 --> 18:02.211
Alive, alive, alive.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.346
Let's go.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.683
Alive, alive, alive.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.813
"Oliver the steer.
Double cranium, cleft palate.“

18:16.971 --> 18:20.100
“Born June 1975,
St Paul's, lowa.“

18:20.224 --> 18:22.067
Oh, Wilbur!

18:22.226 --> 18:23.648
Boy, that's ugly.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.609
Looks like Larry Latiner,
the gym teacher.

18:29.734 --> 18:33.534
- Rich, you're <i>so</i> full of it.
- No...

18:34.280 --> 18:36.408
What happened to your hand?

18:38.576 --> 18:42.046
Oh, it looks so sad.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.461
- Think we can pet him?
- Yeah, sure.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.801
- Hey, it's not gonna rub off on you.
- Let's hope not.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.804
- If you're so brave, you touch it.
- Not me!

19:00.389 --> 19:03.734
- I think I've seen enough.
- Me too. Let's go.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.567
Well, I'll leave too,
so you can ask her out.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.564
Lovely.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.796
- Hey, you guys!
- What?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.631
Get a load of this.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.212
Huh?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.634
- Forget it. I don't want to see, OK?
- You have to.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.347
Richie! Richie!

19:34.882 --> 19:38.307
- What the hell is that?
- It's a mutation.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.940
It's a fake.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.770
It's just like the magicians do.
It's probably made of rubber.

19:49.063 --> 19:53.614
"Born to Mr. And Mrs. Latiner,
Cedar Falls, lowa."

19:53.734 --> 19:56.032
Richie, you're so full of shit.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.616
I'm getting some air.

20:02.493 --> 20:03.995
Wait up.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.336
Hey, wait. Don't go.
It's moving.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.879
It's waving to ya.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.469
Goodbye! Goodbye!

20:23.305 --> 20:25.728
- So long, little fella. Damn!
- What?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.482
- The bastard bit me!
- Come on.

20:29.228 --> 20:33.608
- What? It bit me. Look at that. Damn!
- Oh, come on!

20:37.445 --> 20:40.574
- Asshole!
- Hey, watch who you're calling asshole.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.247
Asshole.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.371
Liz'll clean you up.

21:01.886 --> 21:06.392
Come inside and see Daisy May,
our two-headed cow.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.563
See a sheep with six legs.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.233
Yes, six.
Count 'em yourself, six legs.

21:11.353 --> 21:15.574
And these are creatures of God,
ladies and gentlemen, not man.

21:15.691 --> 21:19.241
All authentic and all alive.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.701
Inside, behind that lovely tent,

21:21.822 --> 21:24.701
you're gonna see some of the most
beautiful girls you've ever seen.

21:24.825 --> 21:28.546
Six of the most beautiful girls
in the world, like my sister Mona here.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.539
Mona, give 'em a little show.
That's a girl.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.168
Open it up... No, that's all.
Just a tease.

21:34.293 --> 21:39.720
Who will dare to face
the challenge of the Fun House?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.473
Who is brave enough?

21:42.593 --> 21:44.095
How about you, sir?

21:45.054 --> 21:50.902
Who is mad enough
to enter that world of darkness?

21:52.520 --> 21:55.649
Terrifying terror ride.

21:57.107 --> 22:00.327
You will scream with terror.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.703
You will beg for release.

22:05.783 --> 22:08.912
But there will be no escape.

22:09.829 --> 22:14.255
For there is no release
from the Fun House.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.883
- So, what about it?
- Huh?

22:18.003 --> 22:21.132
Huh? What do you
wanna do first? It's your choice.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.804
What? What?

22:22.925 --> 22:24.393
How about the magician?
Wanna come?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.978
Yeah. Good idea.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.557
Hell, I love magicians.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.901
I had an uncle once
who was a magician.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.652
I mean it.
Oh, he was bad.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.324
One, please.

22:47.491 --> 22:51.871
Have you seen two guys
and two girls on a double date?

22:51.996 --> 22:54.340
Hey, kid,
I ain't the fortune teller.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.095
Now, I need a volunteer
from the audience.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.682
A young lady,
preferably attractive.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.847
Come on, now. Don't be bashful.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.769
You!
You. Come on.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.613
- No, I couldn't.
- Of course you could. Come on.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.859
Come on. Let's give
our little lady a big hand.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.158
- You're not afraid, are you?
- Yes!

23:30.242 --> 23:31.664
Smart girl.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.081
Please step into the coffin.

23:35.205 --> 23:39.051
Go ahead. Right inside.
I promise you'll feel no pain.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.961
Get a regular job

23:44.798 --> 23:46.800
- Comfy?
- No.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.053
Good.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.189
Now a little... 'history'.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.058
A little history.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.864
In the fifth century,
Vlad V of Wallachia,

24:02.900 --> 24:07.030
known as Vlad the Impaler
to his friends.

24:07.154 --> 24:11.910
Tortured 23,000 prisoners
in a device not unlike this.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.999
Tiring of his name,
he decided to change it.

24:18.123 --> 24:21.753
He selected his father's name, Dracul,

24:23.379 --> 24:24.847
meaning devil.

24:26.924 --> 24:30.428
He added the letter A and became...

24:31.595 --> 24:33.142
...Dracula.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.647
Literally, 'son of the devil'.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.614
And so legends are born.

24:41.772 --> 24:45.993
With that piece of history in mind,
I present, without further ado...

24:47.403 --> 24:49.656
...The Impaler.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.578
Notice, if you will,

24:51.699 --> 24:55.875
that a hole has been cut
in the front of this box,

24:55.995 --> 24:59.124
right over the human heart within.

25:00.249 --> 25:04.379
I insert the stake gently.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.264
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.466
Good.

25:09.591 --> 25:14.142
And now, without further ado,
I present... The Impaler.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.610
Oh, my God! ls there a doctor
in the house? Lights! Lights!

25:29.236 --> 25:32.581
Ladies and gentlemen,
my charming daughter, Carmella.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.788
Thank you for your patronage.
The next show is in two hours.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.048
Gimme a drag!

26:05.898 --> 26:07.775
Hey! It went out.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.242
Wait a sec. Let me get that.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.200
You ready?

26:17.201 --> 26:20.125
- See ya, Richie.
- Hey! Come on, man!

26:22.873 --> 26:24.841
Hey, who wants to go on The Cobra?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.002
Ooh, I do.

26:27.127 --> 26:28.720
Hey, me too.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.092
Hey, you guys,
it isn't even finished yet.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.602
Hey, Richie! Come on!

26:36.136 --> 26:37.729
Come on!

26:52.903 --> 26:55.326
Hey, Buzz, look. A fortune teller.

27:13.841 --> 27:17.562
This is a very
serious business for Madam Zena.

27:17.678 --> 27:22.684
Don't be concerned.
The aspects are wonderful for tonight.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.745
W00-00-00...

28:01.805 --> 28:04.103
A deep, mystic cross.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.565
Good.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.898
It means you were born...

28:12.232 --> 28:14.951
...with a knowledge of the occult.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.376
Are you sensitive?

28:26.997 --> 28:30.547
Do you have premonitions
that often come true?

28:30.667 --> 28:32.419
No.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.382
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.430
Please, I need to concentrate.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.816
Wait. Wait...

28:51.521 --> 28:55.071
Three bracelets.
That is good.

28:55.192 --> 28:59.743
That means a long life-line
springing from the mouth of truth.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.871
Shh!

29:05.994 --> 29:07.246
Wait.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.465
Quite a break in the faith line.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.383
Hmm. It makes sense.

29:18.173 --> 29:22.679
A tall, dark stranger will enter
and change your life.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.641
Larry Latiner, right?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.142
Do not mock the stars,
my friend.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.229
Hey, I thought
she was reading her palm?

29:34.106 --> 29:37.110
Out! Out of here, you bad brats!

29:37.234 --> 29:40.488
I have performed in front
of crowned heads of Europe!

29:47.411 --> 29:51.837
Don't come back or I'll break
every bone in your fuckin' bodies.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.462
Beat it!

30:08.432 --> 30:09.684
Plain burger coming up.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.776
What do you want?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.487
You dropped something.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.736
- I know.
- You know?

30:21.695 --> 30:23.163
- Hey, Buzz.
- Hmm?

30:24.948 --> 30:27.417
How come you never
asked me out before?

30:27.534 --> 30:29.081
I don't know.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.921
- I didn't think you'd go out with me.
- Oh, I would have.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.716
I'm glad you did.

30:39.671 --> 30:45.098
Who will dare to face
the challenge of the Fun House?

30:45.218 --> 30:47.516
Who is brave enough?

30:49.222 --> 30:51.475
Hey, come on, you guys.
It's getting late.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.899
- Want some cotton candy?
- No, thank you.

30:57.481 --> 31:02.954
Who is mad enough
to enter that world of darkness?

31:04.488 --> 31:06.536
Right. Here we go!

31:27.969 --> 31:30.973
Terrifying terror ride.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.857
Goblins, ghosties and ghoulies.

31:35.977 --> 31:41.484
18 of the worst mistakes
that nature ever visited on man or beast.

31:41.608 --> 31:45.033
They are all inside and alive.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.996
My own lovely sister.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.202
Right here.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.121
Mona. The beautiful Mona.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.833
She wiggles and she dances.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.416
- You ever been in one?
- No.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.961
Oh, come on.
It's three bucks apiece.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.009
Besides, you have to be 21.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.053
There she goes.
Turn 'em around, darlin'.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.390
Give 'em a look.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.808
Come on, they always
have holes back there.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.147
Really?

32:12.264 --> 32:14.392
They wiggle and they dance.

32:14.516 --> 32:18.020
Six beautiful girls.
They wiggle and they dance.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.113
They wiggle and they dance.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.066
Well, come on.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.159
Step right up.
They wiggle and dance.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.747
Right this way. Step right up.
They wiggle and dance.

32:28.905 --> 32:32.705
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
girls, girls, girls - beautiful girls!

32:32.826 --> 32:34.794
And remember
what Al Jolson once said.

32:34.911 --> 32:38.415
Ha ha! Wait a minute.
You ain't heard nothing yet!

32:41.001 --> 32:42.423
Careful.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.382
The one and only Liza!

32:47.507 --> 32:48.975
Here she is.

32:51.428 --> 32:55.478
I'm sorry, her name is Marilyn,
but a rose by any other name...

33:00.520 --> 33:04.696
Her name is none other
than Suzanne! There she is.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.873
And now
the piece de resistance,

33:15.994 --> 33:19.589
the one and only Sherry!
There she is! Yes, sir!

33:23.960 --> 33:25.678
What's happening?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.968
You're not gonna like it.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.101
Is it gross?

33:54.783 --> 33:57.002
That's disgusting.

33:58.328 --> 33:59.796
What about me?

33:59.913 --> 34:01.631
Wait your turn.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.171
Shit, I'll find my own hole.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.678
Can't believe I said that.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.514
Where are you going?

34:11.507 --> 34:14.226
Jesus, sweetie!
You scared the shit outta me!

34:14.344 --> 34:16.266
You made me drop my cotton candy,
you creep.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.232
What's a sweet little thing
doing back here anyhow?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.938
Get away from me, you pervert.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.357
Hey, what the hell is going on?

34:23.520 --> 34:26.864
There's nuthin' goin' on just you
goddamn kids messin' everybody up.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.279
Hey, now come here!

34:28.400 --> 34:32.030
I come back here, take a leak
and you take advantage of me!

34:32.152 --> 34:33.746
Is that your dad?

34:35.574 --> 34:39.670
- You OK?
- Yeah. Wasn't he strange?

34:39.786 --> 34:43.835
Hey, looks like old Frankenstein
has to get his jollies also.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.925
I think it's time to go home.

34:46.001 --> 34:49.050
What do you mean,
it's time to go home? It's early.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.507
Boy, is he a weird-looking dude!

34:51.672 --> 34:53.516
I wonder if he sleeps in that outfit.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.889
I just had the greatest idea.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.648
What?

35:01.349 --> 35:02.817
<i>Let's stay.</i>

35:04.436 --> 35:06.814
- Let's spend the night.
- What?

35:07.731 --> 35:09.278
In the Fun House.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.200
You're crazy!

35:11.318 --> 35:13.571
Fred and Eddie did it
in Fairfield County.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.448
Right, and you believe them.
Rich, you're so full of shit.

35:16.573 --> 35:19.827
I'm telling you, they did it,
and so can we.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.379
That is, if we wanted to.

35:23.455 --> 35:27.505
- What do you mean, if we wanted to?
- I told you, he's full of shit.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.505
- Who's full of shit?
- You're full of shit.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.098
OK, then, let's do it.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.554
Hell, it's settled. We're done.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.847
Hello, Ma?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.642
I'm gonna be spending
the night at Amy's.

35:41.514 --> 35:43.983
Yes, I won't be coming home tonight.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.659
Hi, Mama.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.379
Could you put Daddy on, please?

36:04.496 --> 36:07.420
Everything's fine.
Could you put him on?

36:09.000 --> 36:13.426
Hi, Daddy. I'm gonna be spending
the night at Liz's house, OK?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.382
Yeah.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.259
I won't, Daddy.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.182
Is Mama all right?

36:19.344 --> 36:21.472
Yeah, OK. Well, um...

36:21.596 --> 36:23.348
I'll call you in the morning, OK?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.733
Hey, listen.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.938
Tell Joey the movie was great,
all right?

36:31.064 --> 36:32.441
Bye.

36:37.487 --> 36:39.581
- Any problem?
- No.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.915
Hey, are you sure you wanna do this?

36:45.829 --> 36:47.923
- Sure you want to?
- No.

36:55.296 --> 37:00.223
Who is mad enough
to enter that world of darkness?

37:07.809 --> 37:10.437
Have fun! Bye.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.075
Hang on. Here we go.
This is it.

37:18.862 --> 37:22.332
- This had better be good.
- It's gonna be great.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.577
Richie!

37:44.345 --> 37:46.313
What do we have here?

37:53.521 --> 37:55.444
Ow!

40:33.181 --> 40:35.604
Right, we gotta take it around back,

40:35.767 --> 40:39.397
then come all the way
around front, now, right?

40:39.479 --> 40:43.359
What say y'all have a beer first,
all right?

42:06.024 --> 42:08.903
God is watching you!

42:56.616 --> 42:58.289
Damn!

43:08.294 --> 43:10.672
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did.

43:15.510 --> 43:18.605
Hey, Dawson,
did you hear that?

43:53.131 --> 43:54.929
Amy?

43:55.049 --> 43:56.722
OK, I'm coming.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.315
- Well?
- Well what?

44:04.350 --> 44:08.150
Some people just don't know
a good thing when they trip over it.

44:08.271 --> 44:09.568
Oh.

44:25.496 --> 44:28.466
Remember, I don't come cheap.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.960
Oh!

44:30.084 --> 44:33.839
You're a smart boy,
just like your father.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.001
Not enough.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.845
- More.
- More.

45:21.969 --> 45:25.143
Nothing in life comes cheap,
my friend.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.249
More.

45:45.034 --> 45:48.083
You strike a hard bargain,
but OK.

45:50.414 --> 45:54.419
What are you standing around for?
I haven't got all night!

45:54.543 --> 45:56.386
Hurry.

45:56.504 --> 46:00.475
You want to take off the mask? Huh?

46:00.549 --> 46:02.597
No? OK. Hurry.

46:15.398 --> 46:19.278
Lie down! What are you
standing there like an idiot for?

46:25.116 --> 46:27.369
Nothing to be afraid of.

46:34.083 --> 46:38.884
Ah, I see, you're not afraid.
An eager young fella, you are, huh?

46:43.217 --> 46:46.312
Does it feel good, huh? Hmm?

46:53.060 --> 46:54.983
Feels good, huh?

46:55.104 --> 46:59.154
Now relax. Just relax.

46:59.275 --> 47:01.869
Oh. Too late, huh?

47:04.488 --> 47:07.992
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Happens to the best of us.

47:10.995 --> 47:14.625
Felt good, huh?
Well, of course it felt good.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.922
You just relax.

47:26.927 --> 47:30.022
I know what you're thinking.
You want the money back.

47:31.390 --> 47:34.940
Too late, my friend.
A bargain is a bargain.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.899
It's not my fault
if you can't control yourself.

47:45.780 --> 47:49.660
Leave me alone.
I'm going to tell your father.

47:49.784 --> 47:53.834
Do you actually think
I'd let you do it to me, you freak?

47:53.954 --> 47:56.048
Be thankful for small favours!

47:57.041 --> 48:00.921
Leave me alone or I'll put a curse
on you and your whole lot!

48:59.311 --> 49:01.484
Oh, Buzz.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.989
What are we gonna do now?

49:08.529 --> 49:11.203
Let's just get the hell outta here.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.660
Let's try over here.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.504
Richie, be careful.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.049
There's nothing over there.
Let's go the other way.

49:26.714 --> 49:30.264
- Let's try down there.
- I can't see a thing!

49:38.058 --> 49:39.935
- Whoa!
- I'm really scared, Richie.

49:40.102 --> 49:41.604
It's OK. It's OK.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.115
I can't see a thing in here.

49:45.274 --> 49:46.821
Straight ahead.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.996
Hold it. I can see something.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.491
It's a door.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.371
Wait a minute.

50:22.895 --> 50:24.568
It's 0pen_
Shut up!

50:24.688 --> 50:26.110
Wait a goddamn minute.

50:28.609 --> 50:30.282
- I'll be right baek.
- Where are you going?

50:30.402 --> 50:33.121
- What?
- I'm just gonna make sure she's dead.

50:58.430 --> 51:00.148
She's dead.

51:11.151 --> 51:13.119
OK. Now easy.

51:17.741 --> 51:18.993
Shit!

51:19.159 --> 51:21.287
- What's the matter?
- It's locked.

51:21.412 --> 51:22.834
- What?
- Hey, would you

51:22.955 --> 51:26.585
It's a steel door,
and it's got a chain on it.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.632
Can't you force it?

51:29.378 --> 51:31.130
Not without waking the dead.

51:31.255 --> 51:32.598
There's got to be other exits.

51:32.756 --> 51:36.056
- Well, let's try.
- Yeah, let's.

51:37.803 --> 51:40.056
Richie?

51:40.180 --> 51:41.978
Richie, wait for me.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.773
God damn it!

51:44.893 --> 51:46.270
I don't know
which way we're going.

51:46.395 --> 51:49.069
- God damn this!
- There's a light.

51:57.364 --> 51:59.366
Liz, you OK?

52:02.953 --> 52:04.705
Careful.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.545
Oh, this is the front door.

52:13.255 --> 52:15.883
Try the other side, Richie.
I got this one.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.683
Damn!

52:21.680 --> 52:23.808
Shit!

52:27.728 --> 52:29.275
Take it easy. Let's go.

52:35.778 --> 52:37.951
It's OK. It's OK.

52:38.614 --> 52:40.958
Just take it easy.

52:50.876 --> 52:54.130
Damn. How often have
we checked these damn doors?

52:57.758 --> 52:59.726
- Just spend the night over, right?
- What?

53:12.898 --> 53:16.528
So he's lying there
in the dark, and he is exhausted.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.370
And he looks over and says,

53:18.487 --> 53:22.037
"Darlin', you're the greatest.
What was your name again?“

53:22.199 --> 53:25.578
And he sees these two big eyes,
just blinking at him out of the dark,

53:25.703 --> 53:27.956
and suddenly he hears “grrr"!

54:01.780 --> 54:03.908
Ain't you got no respect?

54:05.284 --> 54:07.252
'Course you ain't.

54:08.871 --> 54:10.339
Shit!

54:22.426 --> 54:23.803
Damn it!

54:37.441 --> 54:39.239
What the hell have you done now?

54:47.409 --> 54:49.252
She looks dead all right.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.638
Sweet Jesus!

54:59.713 --> 55:03.843
You didn't tell me it was Zena
the goddamn fortune teller.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.514
You really did it this time.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.185
You killed one of the family. Damn!

55:08.305 --> 55:09.807
I told you, didn't I?

55:09.932 --> 55:12.435
I don't care about that
dirty business with locals,

55:12.559 --> 55:16.234
but you do nothing with our kind,
you understand me?

55:16.313 --> 55:17.656
Damn you!

55:17.773 --> 55:21.698
Should've killed you when you
was born and been done with it.

55:22.736 --> 55:24.283
Father.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.374
I told you never to call me that.

55:28.659 --> 55:30.753
Don't you ever call me that.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.756
Can't stand the sound
of your filthy voice.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.756
Quiet, now. I gotta think.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.513
I said quiet! I got to think!

55:43.173 --> 55:46.347
It'll be all right, just... be quiet

55:47.553 --> 55:49.476
Gotta get us out of this one.

55:51.265 --> 55:52.687
Silly whore.

55:53.642 --> 55:56.771
It'll be all right. Just gimme time
to think, will ya?

56:07.406 --> 56:10.626
Never gonna buy that
with your fingerprints all over.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.500
Maybe the...

56:13.620 --> 56:15.247
Where we gonna...

56:16.999 --> 56:19.001
Wait a minute.

56:19.918 --> 56:22.262
Wait a minute, I got it.

56:22.379 --> 56:24.052
We'll blame it on the locals.

56:25.090 --> 56:26.512
That's what we're gonna do.

56:26.633 --> 56:30.058
We'll just go
and dump her some place.

56:30.178 --> 56:32.681
And then we'll blame it
on the goddamn locals.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.602
Sure. That's the way.

56:39.479 --> 56:41.026
What you got there?

56:41.148 --> 56:42.821
Give it here.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.994
A hundred dollars?

56:50.115 --> 56:52.413
Where the hell did you get
a hundred dollars?

56:54.286 --> 56:57.290
You paid her a hundred dollars?

56:57.414 --> 57:01.760
Jesus, I could have got you one
of them tent girls for fifteen.

57:03.837 --> 57:06.886
You never did understand
the value of a dollar, did you?

57:09.760 --> 57:13.390
A hundred bucks for Madam Zena.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.649
All right. Where is it?

57:23.774 --> 57:25.776
What did you do
with the rest of my money?

57:25.901 --> 57:28.450
Where is it?
What did you do with the rest of it?

57:28.570 --> 57:31.414
Where is the rest of it?
What did you do with it, you idiot?

57:31.531 --> 57:34.205
Where is it? God damn it!
What did you do with it?

57:34.326 --> 57:37.079
Has she got it?
Did you give it to her?

57:37.162 --> 57:40.632
Tell me what you've done with it.
God damn you!

57:40.791 --> 57:44.466
All right. Maybe I'm just
gonna have to help you remember.

57:44.586 --> 57:46.213
I'll make you talk!

57:57.140 --> 58:00.940
Do it, so I won't hit you, boy!
Hit yourself! Attaboy!

58:01.061 --> 58:05.066
Hit it or I'm gonna kill ya!
Hit it, boy!

58:05.190 --> 58:07.659
That's it.
You do it or I'm gonna.

58:08.360 --> 58:11.409
Tell me where my money is!
Where is it?

58:15.492 --> 58:17.745
Tell me who got it. Come on.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.583
Do you got it?
Tell me. Who took it?

58:23.834 --> 58:25.757
You're dead.
You tell me or remember.

58:25.877 --> 58:28.721
Did she take it?
You tell me where...

58:51.653 --> 58:53.246
Who's there?

58:55.282 --> 58:56.955
Who's up there?

59:00.746 --> 59:02.419
Who's up there?

59:03.498 --> 59:05.091
You think we got company?

59:08.170 --> 59:10.047
Hey, you, up there.

59:10.172 --> 59:12.641
Come on down, now.
I wanna talk to you.

59:15.177 --> 59:16.679
Come on.

59:16.803 --> 59:20.398
Ain't nothin' to be afraid of.
I just want to have a few words with you.

59:24.186 --> 59:27.190
Come on. I just want
to give you your lighter back.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.448
What are you all doing up there?

59:32.569 --> 59:35.573
You know you're trespassing
on private property.

59:38.992 --> 59:40.960
Come on.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.830
You're gonna have to come down
sooner or later,

59:42.954 --> 59:45.048
there ain't no other way outta here.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.669
Come on, now!

59:51.421 --> 59:55.392
Oh, there ain't no reason
to be afraid of him. He's harmless.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.396
Once he's been fed.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.317
All right.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:07.441
All right, have it your way.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:13.410
Finders, keepers.
Losers, weepers

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.497
Take off them damn gloves.
We got work to do.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:33.047
It was you. You took the money,
didn't you?

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:35.640
So what if I did?
I thought we were getting out.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.431
You stupid shit.
You're gonna get us all killed.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.308
Let me see it.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.775
You stupid shit!

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.862
I thought we were getting out.
You had the door open.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:51.281
- It was dumb.
- I was gonna split it.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:54.117
Did you see those eyes?

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:57.241
- Maybe we just give the money back.
- It's too late for that now.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.539
- So what do we do?
- We wait.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:03.122
Till they make their first move.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.124
I think they just made it.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.431
- Look, they're just trying to spook us.
- Shit, they are.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.809
- I just heard something move.
- Where?

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:21.929
There.

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.035
Come on.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.913
Stay together.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:04.550
Slow down, you prick!

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:38.795
Am)'-

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:42.258
Amy!

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.964
- Take this.
- I don't want it.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:26.219
- Take it, God damn it!
- I just want to get outta here!

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:30.222
We witnessed a murder, man.
They're gonna try to kill us.

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:33.438
Understand? You got it?

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:36.399
- I'm scared!
- Listen, just calm down, Liz.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.894
I don't know what that thing is,

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:42.693
but we're gonna be a hell of a lot
safer if we stay together, OK?

01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:56.290
It ain't as if I'm askin' you to do
somethin' you ain't never done before.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.593
Come on, boy!

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:06.175
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.470
It's just that...

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.476
Sometimes I get to drinkin'...

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.889
...and I forget to be careful with you.

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:18.066
Come on.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.529
You need me, boy.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.954
You know what they
would have done to you in Dallas,

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.038
if I hadn't been there, don't you?

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:39.542
Them two little half-pint girl scouts
in Memphis.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:45.251
Oh, that was the worst.

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:49.055
The worst.

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.517
Yeah.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:56.180
It's been hard on me.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.984
Real hard.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.980
Ever since your mama...

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.947
And you're little brother Tad
on display over there, like...

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.953
I don't want that for you, boy.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:23.874
I don't want that for you!

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:26.046
So come on!

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:28.962
Come on, boy.

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:30.714
Come on.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:33.887
If you just do
this one last thing for me,

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.597
one bad thing,

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:40.561
and then we'll bury 'em
and I'll take you fishing,

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.855
or anything you want.

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.607
Just like we used to.

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.947
Cos we gotta take care of each other.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.112
As God is my witness...

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:58.329
...I don't hate the sound of your voice.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.377
When I was a kid,

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:09.253
I once tried to spook my older brother
by hiding in his closet.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.266
And while I was waiting in there,
to jump out and scare him,

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.636
a weird thought came into my head.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:23.725
What if he knew I was in there,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.979
and he was standing
just outside the closet door,

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.777
waiting to jump out and scare me?

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.703
So what happened?

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.743
He locked you in, didn't he?

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:42.495
I was in there for three hours,
till my parents got me out.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.665
I was too scared
even to touch the door knob.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.167
I pissed in my pants.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:20.828
He's resting real good now.

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:32.548
You oughta see what I had
to go through to get your number.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.018
I washed him up real good.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.352
He's got a little fever,
and he ain't talkin' too much.

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:54.233
Yeah, poor baby,
we'll get him straight home to bed.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:57.034
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:02.324
Yeah.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.965
God damn it, listen to me!

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.168
We can't help him now!

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:17.843
Richie! Oh, God!
I want him...

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.638
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be OK.

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:44.533
Kill him!

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.886
No! Richie!

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.103
No!

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:25.240
Open it! Open it!

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:28.997
Liz, can you hear me?

01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:32.751
Hey, I'm sorry
we caused you all this trouble.

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:36.134
No trouble.
I was young once myself.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.013
What's the matter, Joey?

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.680
"I'm gonna get even with you.“

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.897
"I'm gonna get you so bad
you're never gonna forget it.“

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.393
What's the matter, son?

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.399
"Never!"

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:55.979
Run!

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.152
Liz! Run!

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:07.873
Liz!

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.219
Liz!

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:34.234
Father!

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.774
- What's the matter, son?
- Guess the cat's got his tongue.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:46.575
Well, I know one little boy
who won't run away again.

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.292
Come on, let's go.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.836
Daddy!

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.508
Daddy!

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:21.757
What do you want?

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.712
Please don't hurt me!

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.713
Please!

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:35.180
I swear I'd never tell
if you'd let me go. Please.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:39.017
Oh, please, let me go.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:07.337
I know you like girls.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.259
I can be nice to you.

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:14.389
I... I... I... You wouldn't
have to pay me anything.

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.397
I could make you feel good.

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.855
I could make you feel good.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:51.598
Please don't hurt me!

01:15:56.927 --> 01:16:00.227
Please... don't... hurt... me.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.066
Let's try over here.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:58.807
Everything's locked.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:05.060
- I've been expecting you.
- Oh! Buzz!

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.774
Hold it, there, sunny.

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.485
Drop that knife. I said drop it!

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.439
Why are you doing this?

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:15.612
I'm just protecting my family.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:18.737
Your family? It's not even human.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.411
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
little lady.

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:25.917
Oh, hell,
he ain't such a bad fella.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:30.040
He does get himself in all sorts
of trouble though, don't he?

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:35.173
Anyway,
blood is thicker than water.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:40.592
And I'm sure he's gonna be
a real comfort to me in my old age.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:46.188
Now, how many people know
you're here?

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:49.941
Lots. They all know.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.361
Well, no matter.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:56.073
We'll be pulling outta here
tomorrow morning.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.238
There's plenty
of other carnivals around.

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.953
What did you do with the other girl?

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.665
Oh, I expect by now he's
just finishing up with her.

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:09.420
We'll just wait here till he gets back.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.588
Oh, my, WW!

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:20.885
That is a gruesome sight.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.797
Get after him, Buzz.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:12.395
Oh, you're real tough,
ain't you, son?

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.988
Come on! Come on!

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:24.696
- Get up!
- Come on!

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.516
You all right?

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:56.481
Oh. my God!

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:58.479
He's gotta have
a set of keys on him.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.658
No! Buzz! No!

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:36.271
Get out of here! Run! Run!
