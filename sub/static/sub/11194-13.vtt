00:06.600 --> 00:08.840
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:09.880 --> 00:12.520
- He's been captured by Sokar.
- Oh, my God.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.600
If Selmak is still alive...
he has been sent to Hell.

00:16.760 --> 00:21.240
- We're talkin' about a rescue mission?
- No one has ever escaped from Netu.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.920
No one except for Jolinar.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.960
I've never had anything more
than flashes of her memories.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.040
The Tok'ra have technology
that aids the recall of memories.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.119
Aaargh!

00:32.280 --> 00:34.840
- Shut it off! Shut it off!
- Do it!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.680
She was tortured... so badly.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.760
It's her father. She knows the stakes.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.320
- But if Samantha cannot recall...
- It's been done before.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.640
It can be done again.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.320
The atmosphere is impenetrable by ship.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.320
The only way to reach the surface
is in the descentpods.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.360
(O'Neill) It's certainly not Emerald City.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.600
We've come to see Bynarr.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.720
- (distorted) Who asks for me by name?
- I do!

01:04.959 --> 01:06.600
Throw them in the pit.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.480
- Sam...
- Dad?

01:08.800 --> 01:11.480
- Are you crazy?
- Uh, apparently.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.120
Sokar's fleet is ten times larger
than we thought.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.080
Find out what they want... then kill them.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.480
No. Wait.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.480
There are transportation rings
in Bynarr's quarters.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.040
Teal'c, do you copy?

01:38.040 --> 01:39.640
We gotta go.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.880
Kneel before Na'onak!

01:45.040 --> 01:47.440
You shall call me Na'onak no longer.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.920
From this day forth,
I will reclaim my real name:

01:56.040 --> 01:57.960
..Apophis.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.680
And now, the conclusion.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.240
You do understand
we're not too happy to see you?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.759
Your insolence is music to my ears.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.200
When I saw you here, I knew I had
found the path out of damnation.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.640
You will be the means by which
I reclaim my rightful power and position.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.760
Your mate Amaunet is dead.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.360
Sorry to ruin your day.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.680
No, actually, I'm wrong about that.
I'm not sorry.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.280
Sokar sent word to me
of Amaunet's death. I did not believe it.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.720
Well, believe it. It's true.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.200
Then Teal'c must be the murderer.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.080
That'd wrap up things real nice for you.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.120
Why is the shol'va not with you?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.120
This one conceals something.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.040 --> 03:03.960
A communication device.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.760
Teal'c, this is your god, Apophis.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.280
Risen from the fires of Netu.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.960
The fate of your friends will be pleasant
compared to what I have planned for you.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.200
Return them to the pit.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.360
Kintac.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.400
You will be my first prime.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.320
It is my honour.

03:41.480 --> 03:45.400
Search them and do whatever is
necessary so they do not escape again.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.800
But do not kill them.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.680
When they are done serving us,
I will have that pleasure for myself.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.600
(lock is secured)

03:56.760 --> 04:00.560
I warned you that Apophis could be
revived using a sarcophagus.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.560
Sokar would rather see his victims
suffering than dead.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.280
He doesn't seem to be suffering much.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.840
He's burning up.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.839
What is Apophis thinking? He can't
hope to defend himself from Sokar.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.880
He seemed pretty confident to me.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.880
Apophis has one chance.
He must convince Sokar not to kill him.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.080
If the reason is good enough,
he may be able to buy his freedom.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.640
- With us?
- The information we hold.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.560
The secrets of Earth and the Tok'ra.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.640
(distant moaning)

05:42.480 --> 05:44.400
(moaning)

05:45.560 --> 05:47.320
Silence, dogs!

05:49.200 --> 05:51.120
Apophis speaks!

05:55.600 --> 05:59.320
(distorted) Bynarr is dead.
Sokar will come.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.120
You fear he will bring his wrath
down upon us.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.520
But he cannot make
our existence any worse.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.360
He could come in a ship
and wipe us out from space!

06:09.520 --> 06:11.720
I can deliver us from this place.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
I have killed the Devil's servant!

06:14.960 --> 06:17.840
- I will destroy Sokar!
- (cheering)

06:18.000 --> 06:21.600
Those that follow and serve me
will be led to freedom.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.680
To a new dominion!

06:23.840 --> 06:29.040
One in which the god Apophis,
risen from the depths of the underworld,...

06:29.640 --> 06:34.600
..will rule over all that was once
shared by the Goa'uld.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.480
This experience doesn't seem
to have humbled him much.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.880
The dawn of our deliverance is upon us!

06:42.040 --> 06:43.760
Have no fear!

06:43.920 --> 06:47.080
Bow to Apophis, the deliverer!

06:49.440 --> 06:51.640
Yes. Sokar will come.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.240
(crowd cheers)

06:56.480 --> 06:58.400
I say let him come!

07:09.000 --> 07:12.480
My lord, a cargo ship was spotted
in orbit around Netu.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.800
Two gliders gave chase
but it entered hyperspace and escaped.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.520
We must assume
that the ship contained spies.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.000
The attack on the System Lords
will begin sooner than planned.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.880
- You will have the fleet ready in two days.
- My lord, the very best we can do...

07:34.920 --> 07:37.120
The fleet will be ready, my lord.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.080
- How many follow me?
- Three hundred.

07:57.240 --> 08:02.440
The rest have been sent to the surface.
They will change their minds or die.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.560
Did you find anything
when you searched the intruders?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.640
Just this.

08:14.240 --> 08:19.240
Even if all the denizens serve you, you
cannot fight Sokar with crude weapons.

08:19.400 --> 08:25.080
Bynarr said he had one day to find out the
identity of the intruders and report back.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.400
Then we have one day before Sokar
sends his ship to destroy us.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.760
Not if I have something he wants.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.080
- You will discover the intruders' identity.
- I already know their identity.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.559
By the time Sokar arrives,
I will know much more.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.280
Bring me the woman.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.280
The woman will come with me.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.360
Um... I don't think so.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.000
OK. OK.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.040
The wound appears cauterised
but there may be bleeding underneath.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.120
Oh, God...

09:37.120 --> 09:39.040
Easy!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.200
Oh, you...!

10:22.840 --> 10:27.600
You used this device to access
the memories of Jolinar left in your mind.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.240
That is how you knew how to escape.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.440
I will use it to get you to tell me
everything I want to know.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.680
- It doesn't work that way.
- I know how it works.

10:37.680 --> 10:43.720
When activated, it makes your memories
easily accessible to your conscious mind.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.080
I won't tell you anything.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.320
The Blood of Sokar will cloud your mind.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.200
Once under its spell,
you will tell me everything.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.800
Sam?

11:42.440 --> 11:44.600
Are you almost ready?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.320
Can we talk?

11:49.560 --> 11:54.200
Sam, you haven't said two words since...
since the accident.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.160
Your brother's made it pretty clear
how he feels.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.320
- He blames you.
- I blame myself.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.360
Your work has always been
more important than us.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.440
You know that's not true.

12:08.920 --> 12:13.040
I don't want you to forgive me.
I don't know if I could accept that yet.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.520
I just want you to understand.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.360
You were supposed to pick Mom up.
You were late.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.760
She took a cab.
There was an accident. I understand.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.720
- I couldn't have known it would happen.
- But Mom is dead.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.200
Nothing I say or do can change that.

12:30.360 --> 12:35.320
All I can do is make sure the things
she loved the most don't die with her.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.960
Sam, without you and your brother,
my life is over.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.560
Nothing else means more to me.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.080
Don't forgive me.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.200
Just tell me one day we'll be OK.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.400
- He blames you.
- I blame myself.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.080
- But Mom is dead.
- Just tell me one day we'll be OK.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.400
Just tell me one day we'll be OK.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.440
No.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.080
I forgave you long ago.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.920
Why am I stuck in this?
The same memory over and over.

13:18.920 --> 13:23.960
I guess if we never had this conversation,
neither one of us would be in this mess.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.680
I would have gone on
hating you and the military.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.000
I never would have got involved
in the Stargate programme.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.920
You would have died of cancer.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.120
- Sam, I am dying.
- What?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.360
I'm dying right now... dying right now.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.400
Only you can save me. (echoes)

13:40.640 --> 13:42.720
- Tell me how to get home.
- What?

13:42.880 --> 13:46.000
Tell me the way home, to Earth.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.920
No, wait.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.240
This is not right.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.120
You'll lose me for ever if you don't
tell me the iris codes. (echoes)

13:58.280 --> 14:00.840
- This is not real.
- Tell me.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.520
Tell me.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.920
- Tell me!
- No!

14:08.080 --> 14:11.320
Tell me how to penetrate
the Earth's Stargate.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.360
Tell me now... or I will kill your father.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.640
Teal'c, this is your god, Apophis.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.240
Risen from the fires ofNetu.

14:35.400 --> 14:40.160
The fate ofyour friends will be pleasant
compared to what I have planned for you.

14:41.360 --> 14:45.280
It was then that I realised they would
not be able to execute the escape plan.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.120
I entered hyperspeed to avoid
the gliders that had detected me.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.040
You must have run the engines at full
power to make the journey so quickly.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.560
The situation was urgent.

14:54.720 --> 14:59.240
I understand your desire to report Sokar's
planned attack on the System Lords...

14:59.400 --> 15:01.680
..as soon as possible.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.160
It may prove invaluable.

15:06.320 --> 15:11.280
I have come seeking assistance to rescue
my friends and your fellow Tok'ra.

15:11.440 --> 15:15.280
I believe Sokar will soon learn
that Apophis has eliminated Bynarr...

15:15.440 --> 15:17.720
..and will take action to restore control.

15:17.880 --> 15:22.480
Wait here. I will consult the High Council
and return shortly with a course of action.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.600
Ow! God...!

15:42.160 --> 15:44.400
Major Carter was most forthcoming.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.960
She didn't tell you squat.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.920
By the way, I won't either.

15:49.080 --> 15:53.280
You're not here to provide information.
You are here for my amusement.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.880
Oh! God, no!

15:58.480 --> 16:00.600
All right, all right, all right...

16:00.840 --> 16:02.120
Charlie!

16:04.720 --> 16:07.640
You must be dying to quench your thirst.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.080
Argh! Oh, God!

16:34.400 --> 16:36.560
Dad?

16:36.720 --> 16:40.080
He's, uh... not so good,
but he's still with us.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.480
Apophis said he was gonna kill him.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.360
No. He, uh...
he brought you back and took Jack.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.560
Are you OK?

16:55.880 --> 16:59.200
They gave me something
called the Blood of Sokar.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.600
It is legendary.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.359
A strong narcotic that can cause
very realistic hallucinations.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.640
I'm pretty sure I didn't give anything up.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.720
Sam?

17:16.240 --> 17:18.160
I'm here.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.680
- I'm here.
- Sam, I hate to sound negative here...

17:23.839 --> 17:26.240
Shh. Save your strength.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.880
- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
- No.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.080
That is unacceptable.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.440
Think about seeing
your grandchildren again.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.160
Don't make me
have to explain this to them.

17:52.960 --> 17:56.040
Martouf... if they come for you...

17:56.280 --> 18:00.240
- I have endured torture before.
- This is like nothing you could imagine.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.320
Everything seems real.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.920
Feelings, sensations.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.400
It's like you're actually there
in your own past.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.760
And then suddenly
everything seems wrong.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.840
Your mind gets all twisted.

18:16.880 --> 18:19.960
Just don't let Apophis
use Jolinar against you.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.720
How could he?

18:24.880 --> 18:29.400
You must be angry about what Jolinar
had to do to escape from here.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.560
Martouf,...

18:35.480 --> 18:37.400
..she loved you.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.800
Charlie! Sorry I'm late.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.040
I stopped to get you somethin'.
You in there?

18:55.720 --> 18:57.800
You're dead! You're dead!

19:00.320 --> 19:04.400
- Where'd you get that?
- Jeff Eisen gave it to me. It's a water gun.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.200
- It doesn't matter.
- You have a gun. (echoes)

19:08.520 --> 19:10.720
- That's different.
- Why?

19:10.880 --> 19:13.800
Charlie... Charlie!

19:14.560 --> 19:16.320
Where you goin'?!

19:16.480 --> 19:19.600
- Inside.
- Wait a minute. I got you somethin'.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.360
- Come on. We'll play some catch.
- This is not what happened, Dad.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.560
You're changing everything
just to make it better.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.640
I know.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.480
Can't we just play catch?

19:32.640 --> 19:35.400
What happened is
you got mad at me and I went inside.

19:35.560 --> 19:39.000
Two weeks from now,
I shot myself with your gun. (echoes)

19:39.560 --> 19:42.720
We never played catch today
and we never will.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.240
Why?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.760
Why can't we just play catch?

19:49.000 --> 19:52.480
I'll play... if you tell me... if you tell me.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.600
What do you wanna know?
I'll tell you anything.

19:59.760 --> 20:03.080
Tell me how you made contact
with the Asgard. (echoes)

20:03.880 --> 20:05.560
..the Asgard.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.040
- What?
- You represented Earth in the talks...

20:08.200 --> 20:10.600
..between the Asgard
and the System Lords.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.680
- How'd you know that? (echoes)
- It's OK, Dad. You can tell me.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.680
Tell me the address
of the Asgard home world.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.760
I don't know it.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.800
The world where the ancients' knowledge
was downloaded into your brain.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.840
That was cool, wasn't it?

20:27.520 --> 20:29.840
You can't know that.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.240
- This isn't you.
- Sure it is.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.280
Come on, Dad. We'll have a catch.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.200
Just like you want.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.280
No.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.560
No.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.160
I have been instructed to return to Netu.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.280
- What is inside the container?
- A weapon.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.480
For what purpose?

21:13.600 --> 21:18.920
The High Council believes the uprising
of Apophis presents a key opportunity.

21:19.080 --> 21:23.320
Sokar will take his mother ship into orbit
around Netu to restore order there.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.440
This weapon is intended for Sokar.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.720
Yes, but unfortunately we have
no weapons capable of penetrating...

21:29.880 --> 21:31.960
..the shields of a Goa'uld mother ship.

21:32.120 --> 21:36.440
- So how will this weapon be effective?
- I am to launch it towards the moon,...

21:36.600 --> 21:39.440
..into one of the holes of its surface
and into the core.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.120
It will force the base elements
into a cataclysmic chain reaction.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.160
The moon will explode,
taking Sokar's ship with it.

21:46.320 --> 21:50.680
- Along with everything else.
- The Tok'ra have no alternative.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.800
Sokar cannot be permitted
to rise to a dominant power.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.560
It would end our chances
of defeating the Goa'uld.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.000
What of rescuing my friends
trapped there?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.360
I am charged with my mission.

22:01.520 --> 22:06.840
If you intend to stand in my way, I will
insist that you remain here on Vorash.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.200
I will accompany you.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.520
Then we must leave immediately.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.920
- Jack.
- No...

22:32.080 --> 22:34.000
I don't wanna go to school.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.080
Ow.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.320
- You OK?
- No.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.200
They, uh... they took Martouf.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.480
They put that damn memory thing on me.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.120
And then they gave me something...

23:02.520 --> 23:04.640
..that reminded me of the '70s.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.440
The Blood of Sokar.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.280
Daniel...

23:12.440 --> 23:15.800
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna pass out again.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.960
If Sokar is not in orbit around Netu
when we arrive,...

23:29.360 --> 23:32.080
..a rescue could still be attempted.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.240
Yes.

23:35.400 --> 23:40.720
But if he is already in orbit, we must
act swiftly and launch the weapon.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.360
I don't like this any more than you do.
But essentially this is war.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.800
If Sokar ascends to ultimate power,...

23:50.040 --> 23:54.120
..the consequences will be far greater
than losing a few good people.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.920
I understand.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.520
Timing will be critical.
Once the weapon is launched,...

23:59.680 --> 24:03.640
..it will take 12 minutes
for the reaction to reach critical mass.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.920
If Sokar has enough warning,...

24:06.080 --> 24:10.120
..he will have time to escape
the range of the explosion.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.920
No, please.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.360
(hiss)

24:34.720 --> 24:37.040
Jolinar was your mate.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.480
Tell me the location
of the Tok'ra resistance or she dies.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.880
- Don't do it, Martouf.
- Silence.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.280
Please...

24:57.800 --> 24:59.320
Tell me now.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.200
I am not Jolinar.
Don't tell him anything. (echoes)

25:08.640 --> 25:10.560
Tell me.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.000
- I cannot let him kill you.
- No, Martouf.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.120
No, Martouf.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.120
Entac.

25:30.720 --> 25:34.680
The Tok'ra resistance
is based on the planet Entac.

25:40.880 --> 25:45.000
Return them to the pit.
Bring me Daniel Jackson.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.520
- Speak.
- Your fleet is ready, my lord.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.080
You have done well.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.440
Bynarr has not yet reported
as you wished.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.760
I will take my ship
and cleanse the underworld...

26:08.920 --> 26:10.920
..so that its fires may be reborn.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.760
Then I will launch the attack
on the System Lords.

26:15.080 --> 26:19.200
Soon the entire realm of the Goa'uld
will serve me...

26:20.760 --> 26:24.360
..or suffer the fate of the damned.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.040
I knew it was you.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.760
You shouldn't have done it, Martouf.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.880
I could not watch him kill you, Samantha.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.680
You lied.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.920
Entac is a primitive planet.
There are no Tok'ra there.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.320
You were very convincing.
I believed you.

27:08.480 --> 27:12.160
If Apophis believes he knows
the location of the Tok'ra,...

27:12.320 --> 27:15.120
..what does he want from Dr Jackson?

27:23.160 --> 27:25.200
Hey!

27:25.360 --> 27:28.680
- I just wanted to see how you were doin'.
- Good.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.080
OK.

27:32.960 --> 27:38.280
Kasuf sent me some of Sha're's things
after the funeral. He said that, um...

27:39.000 --> 27:42.840
Well, he said that
she would've wanted me to have them.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.120
We both drank from this cup
at our wedding.

27:49.120 --> 27:54.240
- I know I shouldn't have hoped, but...
- Hey. You can never give up.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.000
- How about now?
- Especially not now.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.880
Sha're didn't want you
to just give up, did she?

28:05.040 --> 28:08.160
As I recall,
she wants you to find the boy. (echoes)

28:11.160 --> 28:14.520
You didn't believe Sha're
sent a message through the hand device.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.240
I've been wrong about a lot of things.

28:17.960 --> 28:23.000
And I know I don't always sound like
I believe you, but I do believe in you.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.680
What did you say she called the boy?
(echoes)

28:27.840 --> 28:29.120
Harsesis.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.720
I mean, the kid holds all the knowledge
of the Goa'uld who fathered him, right?

28:33.880 --> 28:34.800
Yeah.

28:34.960 --> 28:39.320
He could be the key to us kickin' those
slimy snakeheads out of the galaxy.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.880
Yeah, that's what Sha're said.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.920
All you have to do is figure out
where Amaunet sent him.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.440
The name?

28:50.640 --> 28:53.440
Name of the place Amaunet sent the boy.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.520
- No.
- What?

28:56.280 --> 28:58.400
No, I'm not... telling you.

28:58.560 --> 29:02.280
Come on. You know me.
I just can't remember... can't remember.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.440
No.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.760
- You told me before.
- No!

29:10.440 --> 29:12.160
This is not real.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.960
(Sokar) Hear me, Bynarr.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.080
Why do you defy your lord, Sokar?

29:27.440 --> 29:30.160
Bynarr is dead by my hand.

29:30.320 --> 29:33.800
I am Apophis,
and the denizens of Netu follow me.

29:34.680 --> 29:38.440
I will bring the full force
of my weapons down upon you.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.160
You will die in burning hellfire.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.160
First you will hear me.

29:58.120 --> 30:02.880
We must hold our position in the shadow
of the moon so we are not detected.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.680
Before you fire upon us, know this:
I have tortured the intruders.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.720
Three from the Tauri and a Tok'ra.

30:11.040 --> 30:15.800
I have learnt much, including
the location of the Tok'ra resistance.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.120
Bynarr was weak.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.000
He was incompetent.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.520
A Goa'uld of your superior power
deserves more.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.760
I wish to serve you.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.800
I offer this information
I have gathered as proof.

30:35.200 --> 30:39.320
Grant me an audience and allow me
to show my reverence to you...

30:39.480 --> 30:41.640
..by bowing at your feet.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.800
I will grant you this request.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.160
I am for ever in your service.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.800
Take him away.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.960
Be quick!

31:20.520 --> 31:24.160
Sokar will die by my hand
and I will command his domain.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.360
Surely he will not let you
enter his ship with weapons.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.560
Do you think I am a fool?

31:32.720 --> 31:35.800
I have been planning this
since the moment I was sent here.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.000
I will convince Sokar to make me
the new lord of Netu.

31:39.320 --> 31:43.160
He will come down off his throne
to brand me with his seal,...

31:43.320 --> 31:45.720
..and when he gets close enough...

31:59.880 --> 32:03.160
On my command, replace this - here.

32:31.400 --> 32:35.160
Someone has transported from Netu
to Sokar's vessel.

32:38.400 --> 32:42.520
The weapon is ready for launch.
Sokar's ship is almost in position.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.080
Sokar's ship's in orbit.
Apophis went up to meet him.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.160
I managed to get this.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.360
Nice.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.800
- Can Sokar pick up the transmission?
- The signal is coded.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.440
- Teal'c, it's Carter. Can you hear me?
- Wait!

33:13.520 --> 33:17.120
- Major Carter, it is l.
- Thank God.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.280
Stop!

33:34.800 --> 33:36.720
(distant cries)

33:38.800 --> 33:42.360
- What the hell is that?
- (man) Sokar is attacking!

33:51.720 --> 33:53.840
Teal'c, what's going on?

33:55.600 --> 33:58.360
You have 12 minutes
until Netu is destroyed.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.880
- What? Why?
- I am here with the Tok'ra Aldwin.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.160
He has launched a weapon
into the moon, which will explode,...

34:05.320 --> 34:08.880
..destroying Sokar's ship,
which is in its orbit.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.679
The High Council must believe
it is the only choice...

34:11.840 --> 34:16.000
- ..or they would not sacrifice us this way.
- We're not dead yet.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.800
(shouting and moaning)

34:26.560 --> 34:28.679
I have an idea.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.679
Help me pack this. Fill in this vent.
As many rocks as you can.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.080
Wedge them in real tight.

34:49.080 --> 34:52.800
My time of suffering has taught me
the strength of your power, my lord.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.440
Tell me the information
you extracted from the intruders.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.720
I beg you to grant me
the privilege of ruling Netu.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.080
Bynarr was not worthy of such honour.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.920
Tell me the location
of the Tok'ra rebellion.

35:07.080 --> 35:10.440
That is only one of the many
valuable things I have learnt.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.840
Why do you try my patience?

35:26.280 --> 35:30.120
Tell me and I will grant you your wish...

35:30.960 --> 35:33.680
..and brand you Lord of the Underworld.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.920
The Tok'ra are based on the planet Entac.

35:51.160 --> 35:56.000
- What is the meaning of this?
- I recently conquered Entac.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.200
There are no Tok'ra there.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.560
Kill him.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.000
Slowly.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.080
We have less than nine minutes.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.600
If we stay longer,
we risk being caught in the explosion.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.080
- I will take that risk.
- Even if Martouf and your friends...

36:22.240 --> 36:24.200
..make it to the transporter rings,...

36:24.360 --> 36:26.920
..Sokar's ship is in the path
of the matter stream.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.640
There is no way we can intercept them.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.320
Teal'c, unhand me! Teal'c!

36:36.040 --> 36:38.120
Teal'c, this is suicide.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.560
Teal'c!

36:55.560 --> 36:57.440
Go!

37:09.440 --> 37:11.720
Aaaarrghhhh!

37:22.600 --> 37:24.560
(shouts ofpanic)

37:25.640 --> 37:26.960
We're on our way!

37:27.240 --> 37:30.960
Timing is critical, Daniel Jackson.
Tell me precisely when you are ready.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.480
Teal'c, listen carefully!

37:39.640 --> 37:42.720
To intercept the matter stream,
you must fly the cargo ship...

37:42.880 --> 37:44.880
..between Sokar's ship and the planet.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.920
If you do not come to a complete stop,
we could miss part of the matter stream.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.000
Your friends would die.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.960
And that's only if Sokar
doesn't blow us out of the sky.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.640
Get in position!

38:03.720 --> 38:05.360
Almost there, Teal'c.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.080
Aaarrrghhh!

38:09.600 --> 38:12.600
Forgive me!
The hellfires of Netu are erupting, my lord.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.760
- What?
- The moon's core has become unstable.

38:15.920 --> 38:19.160
That is impossible. I control Netu!

38:19.440 --> 38:21.320
We must move the ship.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.800
Aarghh!

38:43.080 --> 38:46.480
(roars)

38:53.040 --> 38:54.680
Marty?

38:54.840 --> 38:56.760
Now!

38:57.360 --> 38:59.640
We're ready, Teal'c!

39:13.800 --> 39:16.240
They're here! Go! Go! Go!

39:51.320 --> 39:53.520
We have escaped.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.400
Iced tea.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.480
Air conditioning.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.680
Water.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.880
Thanks.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.880
I'm sorry I doubted you.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.800
I am as surprised as you that we survived.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.400
Thank you.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.360
Do you have any leave coming up?

40:38.520 --> 40:40.440
Yeah, a little.

40:41.680 --> 40:45.200
I was thinking we could take
a father-daughter vacation together.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.840
That'd be great, Dad.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.640
I hear Alaska's cold this time of year.
