00:00.010 --> 00:01.750
I am a king, you are a king.

00:01.800 --> 00:04.470
Let's all be kings together.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.870
Your Majesty.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.240
Sir!

00:08.520 --> 00:09.750
No!

00:09.800 --> 00:12.550
My reputation has been ruined and
my servant has been shot, sir.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.030
~ Let me go!
~ Everyone will ask why she did this.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.150
But nobody knows who shot at you.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.230
Lady Pole may be put in an asylum.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.510
You are Norrell's men.
I am sold once more.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.910
~ Stephen! Turn me...
~ We are no friends to Mr Norrell.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.550
~ What happened behind the mirror?
~ The King's Roads.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.950
Promise me you will not go
out on those roads again.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.030
No.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.470
Damn magic to hell.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.190
Damn where it's lead us.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.870
CROAKING HOWL

00:34.920 --> 00:37.030
Can a magician kill a man by magic?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.670
I suppose a magician might.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.270
But a gentleman never could.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.510
He has murdered my book.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.550
We must not let this stand.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.110
You must not!

00:46.160 --> 00:47.750
I am home.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.030
Oh, God...

00:49.080 --> 00:52.190
We'll go back to Shropshire, and
I will cease to do practical magic.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.270
I will write down my
thoughts in a book.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.990
Once again, it is the stupid
magician who thwarts us.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.390
We must find and awaken a Moss-Oak.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.390
He will bargain her life away

01:02.440 --> 01:05.110
and he will have no notion
that he has done so.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.830
~ Napoleon is back.
~ What?

01:06.880 --> 01:09.550
The Duke, he asks you to
renew your commission.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.870
I am sorry, Mrs Strange,

01:10.920 --> 01:14.560
but your husband is the army's
magician, and we have need of him.

Keep going, come on!

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
Move, move. Come on!

02:10.400 --> 02:12.230
Hold the gates. Hold the gates!

02:12.280 --> 02:14.150
Hold the gates!

02:14.200 --> 02:16.750
Not rain, Merlin! Not rain!

02:16.800 --> 02:19.540
You may have this rain, or that fire!

~ Aim on the wall.
~ Merlin. Where is Wellington?

02:51.520 --> 02:54.710
Can you see him? Find him.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.470
Merlin!

02:56.520 --> 02:58.150
SCREAMS

02:58.200 --> 03:00.800
Merlin. They are scaling the wall!

03:02.080 --> 03:03.720
Merlin!

03:12.440 --> 03:14.360
WHISPERS ECHO

03:23.400 --> 03:25.160
SOLDIERS SCREAM

03:28.360 --> 03:30.350
Merlin, they're breaking through!

03:30.400 --> 03:33.600
Stop messing around and
find my reinforcements!

03:37.160 --> 03:39.760
These gates won't hold much longer!

03:40.200 --> 03:41.640
Down!

03:55.040 --> 03:56.950
I attack!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.340
Charge!

04:02.680 --> 04:04.160
No!

04:33.680 --> 04:35.550
Salut!

04:35.600 --> 04:37.520
JONATHAN SCREAMS

05:04.560 --> 05:09.080
['Merlin! Hold the gates!
Hold the gates!']

05:26.600 --> 05:28.000
Jonathan?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.630
Have you written much today?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.880
Oh. Yes, quite a bit.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.280
BELL TOLLS SOBBING

06:11.800 --> 06:13.940
I was told you were dead.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.350
I felt certain you would be.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.990
Well, gentlemen...

06:44.120 --> 06:45.990
.. the war is over.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.180
What do you think they'll
do with us now?

07:06.440 --> 07:09.200
Come. I want to show you something.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.800
The King's Roads. They're
almost finished.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.990
Bell, you are clever.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.190
That's four of them
done, but, of course,

07:23.240 --> 07:24.990
Mr Murray will want them engraved.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.310
This is just how it looked.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.030
You make me very proud.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.880
The light's very good in here.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.870
But why publish Strange's
book, Mr Murray?

07:44.920 --> 07:47.230
I am a book publisher, Mr Norrell.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.470
Surely it should be no great
surprise that I publish a book?

07:50.520 --> 07:52.350
Magic is a very popular subject.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.750
The Friends Of English
Magic sells well.

07:54.800 --> 07:59.710
Mr Lascelles' book sold very well,
until Mr Strange reviewed it.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.950
Why undo all this good
work by putting out a book

08:02.000 --> 08:03.470
so at odds with the orthodoxy?

08:03.520 --> 08:05.870
That would be with your
orthodoxy, Mr Norrell.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.550
~ And how do we know that it...?
~ Because that is what he does, sir!

08:08.600 --> 08:10.590
Three volumes, laying
English Magic naked

08:10.640 --> 08:12.430
for all who choose to salivate over!

08:12.480 --> 08:14.310
I do not know what
the end of it will be!

08:14.360 --> 08:16.510
Well, the beginning
of it will be that

08:16.560 --> 08:20.070
volume one of Mr Strange's
book is published in August.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.110
It is the most dangerous and seditious
thing of which I have ever heard!

08:23.160 --> 08:25.190
Publish and you shall
have no more editions of

08:25.240 --> 08:26.950
The Friends Of English Magic, sir.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.540
That is Mr Norrell's prerogative.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.919
You have made an enemy of us, sir.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.960
Aye, well...

08:45.240 --> 08:46.840
There you go.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.750
"The History And Practice
Of English Magic.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.470
"Marvel at what he has done.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.870
"Dare to dream of what he may yet do.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.070
"Mr Strange's remarkable
book of magic."

08:59.120 --> 09:01.550
Why on earth does he insist on
punishing me in this manner?

09:01.600 --> 09:03.670
~ Whatever wrong did I do him?
~ None, sir.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.470
It is not for myself I fear,
Mr Lascelles. It is for England.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.470
There is a danger, both
in what he will say

09:08.520 --> 09:10.790
and in the very fabric
of the books themselves.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.630
Really, it would be
most agreeable to me

09:12.680 --> 09:15.620
to never see or hear
from that man again.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.880
HORSE GRUNTS

09:31.480 --> 09:33.640
BELL TOLLS

09:48.560 --> 09:49.830
Madam!

09:53.360 --> 09:55.830
Madam! Madam, I beg your pardon!

09:57.360 --> 09:58.630
Madam?

10:02.280 --> 10:03.820
Mrs Strange?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.140
Mrs Strange!

10:10.240 --> 10:11.780
Mrs Strange!

10:15.400 --> 10:16.940
Mrs Strange!

10:18.480 --> 10:20.350
~ A bell?
~ Yes, sir.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.150
What bell could there
have been, Mr Hyde?

10:24.200 --> 10:26.800
Well, that was just the beginning.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.630
I looked to the South, and I...

10:30.160 --> 10:34.910
I saw a lady, walking away from me.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.430
Just walking on, into the snow.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.950
Black gown, no shawl, not
even a pair of shoes.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.100
Only, when I reached the
top, she was nowhere.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.510
Forgive me, I do not
see why you come to me.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.510
~ You should ride to the Magistrate.
~ It was Mrs Strange, sir.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.190
My mother? My mother is dead.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.830
You... you believe you saw her ghost?

10:53.880 --> 10:55.550
Your wife, sir.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.510
It could not have been my wife.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.800
Mrs Strange's father was curate
of my parish 47 years.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.470
I've known her since she took her
first steps in Clunbury churchyard.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.070
Arabella has not left Ashfair
these past five days.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.430
Besides, she never wears black.
I hate to see her in black.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.790
I'm not the first to have seen a
woman in black wandering hereabouts.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.340
Well, whoever the poor woman
is, she is not my wife.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.910
~ We may call Mrs Strange here.
You may see with your own eyes.
~ No.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.360
I do not wish to distress her.

11:30.240 --> 11:34.350
Sir, could it not be something
to do with... your magic?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.950
I have ceased to do practical magic.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.910
I did my last at Waterloo.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.910
I just write my book now.

11:40.960 --> 11:45.190
And Mrs Strange spends most of her
time encouraging me to finish it.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.840
Well, I'm glad Mrs Strange is safe.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.240
Well... sorry for
disturbing you, sir.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.710
HYDE COUGHS

11:57.760 --> 11:59.320
Thank you.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.620
Look after her, sir.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.190
Do you think there
will be another war?

12:15.240 --> 12:18.280
It is my most fervent hope
that there will not be.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.350
And how do you think things between
you and Norrell will fall out?

12:23.400 --> 12:27.310
Oh... like any other dull,
academic controversy.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.630
Books, articles, factions...

12:30.520 --> 12:35.310
One of us will win, posterity will
take a little from us both...

12:35.360 --> 12:38.030
and then we shall both be forgotten.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.790
As for my own future...

12:43.560 --> 12:47.800
~ I wish to spend it quietly, with my wife.
~ Hmm.

12:49.320 --> 12:50.590
I should also like to cut down

12:50.640 --> 12:53.190
the copper beeches
that my father planted

12:53.240 --> 12:56.110
and do something about
the East garden.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.190
And what about a child?

13:02.720 --> 13:05.660
That would be a fine
thing, would it not?

13:06.840 --> 13:09.840
Then we should see what
we can do about it.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.660
Mr Segundus, Mr Segundus!

13:45.640 --> 13:47.400
Mr Honeyfoot!

13:52.160 --> 13:54.310
Good Lord. Whatever is it?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.750
Mr Segundus!

13:55.800 --> 13:57.790
You must send a message
to Jonathan Strange.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.470
Something terrible is going
to happen. You must send word.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.790
What did she say?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.790
She says we must go to
Jonathan Strange's house.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.040
HORSE AND CARRIAGE CLATTER

14:11.840 --> 14:14.470
It is very important that you
listen to me. Do you understand?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.830
Wait a moment.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.270
On a May morning in 1310,

14:17.320 --> 14:19.470
the wife of a Christian
lighthouse keeper

14:19.520 --> 14:21.990
found a cupboard in her kitchen.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.310
Do you understand?

14:24.360 --> 14:25.790
No. I'm so sorry.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.350
KNOCKS AT DOOR

14:28.400 --> 14:31.990
The cupboard kept calling
to her, again and again.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.030
She told her husband,
who thought she was mad.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.120
But when she stepped inside the
cupboard, she was never seen again.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.070
I mean to say that
she was stolen away.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.390
Your friend, madam -
she's in great distress.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.990
May I take you to her?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.750
You must send word to Jonathan
Strange at Ashfair House.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.870
Tell him he must not make
the bargain. He must not.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.350
I'm sorry, madam.
I do not understand.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.670
I mean... I mean to say Moss-Oak!

14:58.720 --> 15:00.120
Moss-Oak!

15:04.200 --> 15:05.550
Moss-Oak!

15:05.600 --> 15:09.240
I mean to say Moss-Oak. Moss-Oak!

15:11.080 --> 15:12.960
SHE CRIES OUT

15:14.680 --> 15:16.520
Bell! No.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.000
Bell! No.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.960
WIND WHISTLES SHUTTER BANGS

15:48.080 --> 15:50.350
Mary, where is Mrs Strange?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.980
Is she not still in bed, sir?

15:54.840 --> 15:56.750
No.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.160
HORSE WHINNIES HOOVES CLATTER

16:06.920 --> 16:09.520
Would you find her for me, please?

16:16.200 --> 16:18.630
An hour ago, I saw Mrs Strange
upon the Welsh hills.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.270
I am in no doubt, sir. It was her.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.750
Bell? Arabella?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.590
She is not in the house, sir.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.150
We do not know where she is.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.670
She'll freeze herself to death.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.950
Bring me some water, Mary.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.200
Now!

16:33.200 --> 16:34.740
Fill it up.

16:36.840 --> 16:40.240
~ Mr Strange, ought we not ride out...
~ Quiet. Quiet.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.320
TIMBERS CREAK

16:58.840 --> 17:00.590
Sir, what is this meant to do?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.310
Find her.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.560
Not in England, not in
Wales, not in Scotland...

17:07.280 --> 17:08.800
Yah! Yah!

17:11.160 --> 17:12.839
Mary? Mary!

17:14.160 --> 17:16.300
Fetch my coat and boots.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.800
Mrs Strange! Mrs Strange!

17:23.000 --> 17:25.829
Madam! Madam! Mrs Strange!

17:25.880 --> 17:27.790
Arabella! Arabella!

17:27.839 --> 17:29.960
Mrs Strange!

17:38.400 --> 17:39.990
Arabella!

17:40.040 --> 17:41.790
Mrs Strange? Madam!

17:41.840 --> 17:43.510
Where are you?

17:45.200 --> 17:47.990
~ Bell!
~ Mrs Strange!

17:48.040 --> 17:50.720
~ Arabella!
~ Mrs Strange!

17:51.840 --> 17:53.640
Madam!

17:58.920 --> 18:00.460
Mrs Strange!

18:07.160 --> 18:08.700
Mrs Strange!

18:11.600 --> 18:14.870
So, we have Clunbury, Ashfair,
and the Marches.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.120
I think I woke last night.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.830
You did not say this before.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.080
I did not remember before.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.630
Arabella was getting out of the bed.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.960
Whoa!

18:49.640 --> 18:51.840
I thought I had dreamt it.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.790
Bell. Oh, thank God.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.190
Where on earth have you been?

19:03.240 --> 19:08.150
Walking... in the woods...
with my brothers and sisters.

19:08.200 --> 19:12.230
~ Madam, you are as cold as the grave.
~ Bell, what have you got on?

19:12.280 --> 19:14.190
It's this way, madam.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.600
Please!

19:18.080 --> 19:20.480
Madam. Madam, please. Quickly.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.350
Am I... Am I your wife?

19:26.400 --> 19:29.030
Of course you are. Of
course you're my wife.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.670
Do you... accept me as your wife?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.510
Yes, yes. What...

19:34.560 --> 19:37.520
Madam, madam. We must
make haste. Please.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.750
You renounce all other wives?

19:45.800 --> 19:47.830
Bell, of course I do. Of course.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.750
With all my heart.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.950
Where is my friend?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.310
I'm sorry, madam.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.760
Madam...

20:02.880 --> 20:06.120
Welcome to Lost-Hope.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.270
Oh, she's dreadful cold, sir.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.120
Bell, my love. What
were you thinking?

20:21.960 --> 20:24.720
You are a poor husband.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.750
Your husband has bargained
you away, madam.

20:29.800 --> 20:34.400
He has sold you to me in exchange
for a piece of wood.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.190
You are to be mine for all
time... and never leave.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.270
I tried to tell you of this.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.550
~ Emma...
~ Bell.
~ Emma!

20:45.600 --> 20:47.030
Take us home, Stephen.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.360
Shh...

21:01.480 --> 21:07.200
I do not offer anything that will
not be exquisitely agreeable to you.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.940
My husband will hear of this.

21:11.480 --> 21:15.280
There is no husband. Not any more.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.400
LAUGHTER

21:22.600 --> 21:24.840
Bell...

21:29.920 --> 21:32.600
Bell? Bell, no!

21:37.040 --> 21:38.920
It's me!

22:13.760 --> 22:17.160
No! Bell! No!

22:19.960 --> 22:22.870
Bell, no! It's me.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.440
Stop!

22:32.920 --> 22:35.120
She is quite peaceful now.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.590
What is this you do?

22:40.640 --> 22:45.230
My mother used to tell me tales
of magicians, different creatures.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.670
It... it was really what first drew
me to magic - er, the romance of it.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.320
The tales I heard when I was a boy.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.910
When she d... When she...

22:54.960 --> 22:58.710
when she died, I went around
collecting folk-tales,

22:58.760 --> 23:00.500
writing them up.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.750
And that story Lady
Pole told last night -

23:03.800 --> 23:05.710
the lighthouse keeper
and his cupboard -

23:05.760 --> 23:07.950
it made me think I
have heard it before.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.670
It is much like a tale told by
the fishwives of Flamborough,

23:11.720 --> 23:13.670
about a man called Bloodworth,

23:13.720 --> 23:17.470
who lit the lamp in the
lighthouse during the 1500s.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.870
Is it a common story?

23:18.920 --> 23:20.870
No, and the way she told it,

23:20.920 --> 23:24.510
it's not quite the same as
I have it in my book. But...

23:24.560 --> 23:26.390
And what do you mean to say?

23:26.440 --> 23:29.470
I do not believe Lady Pole's
stories are nonsense.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.260
I believe there is a pattern to them.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.080
Bell?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.990
Oh, God, Bell.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.470
And what do you consider so
dangerous about this book?

24:29.520 --> 24:31.060
Everything!

24:31.880 --> 24:34.150
Do you think I take the books
of English magic to myself

24:34.200 --> 24:36.390
because I am some sort of miser, sir?

24:36.440 --> 24:39.670
Because I rub my hands in glee,
desiring to have it all?

24:39.720 --> 24:42.110
No, sir, no. No, I gather
these books because they are

24:42.160 --> 24:43.550
so very powerful and dangerous -

24:43.600 --> 24:45.750
and Mr Strange's book is
the most dangerous of all.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.790
You consider that his book will
give ammunition to the Johannites?

24:48.840 --> 24:53.070
It is not a matter of consideration,
my lord, it is a matter of...

24:53.120 --> 24:55.310
I beg your pardon.
Give ammunition to...?

24:55.360 --> 24:58.710
The Johannites. Machine-breakers.
The rioters in the North.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.230
I do not understand. What do
rioters have to do with magic?

25:01.280 --> 25:04.110
~ Do you never look in a newspaper, sir?
~ No.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.790
These men have lost their
employment to the new machines.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.830
They destroy factories and looms

25:09.880 --> 25:13.190
and proclaim themselves to be
the followers of the Raven King.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.950
They carry his banner, they daub
his blazon on the walls of...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.110
There is a ragged preacher
going around the North

25:18.160 --> 25:20.310
telling people that the
Raven King is coming back.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.110
He's not coming back... is he?

25:23.160 --> 25:25.430
That is a ridiculous notion.

25:29.200 --> 25:33.280
But I see your anxiety.
I... I see your anxiety.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.430
After all, the Raven King
has always been associated

25:37.480 --> 25:39.590
with riot and revolution.

25:39.640 --> 25:42.790
You think Strange's book
will support the Raven King?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.270
Everything he's done
and said would say so.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.310
Then we must hope he sees sense.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.190
Or that something occurs to stop him.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.080
Yes. Yes, indeed.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.440
~ Not now, Henry. Not now!
~ Whoa. Whoa.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.120
I hope you'll forgive the mess,
I rather thought it was...

26:46.840 --> 26:49.310
HENRY SOBS

26:49.360 --> 26:52.480
Now, Henry, do not take
on. It is all right.

27:02.480 --> 27:06.390
Come, now. Let's have
something to eat.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.580
I can spare half an hour.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.950
May I conduct the funeral?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.150
Funeral, Henry? What would
be the point of that?

27:28.200 --> 27:31.590
But, well - how else...?

27:31.640 --> 27:34.180
There is to be no funeral, Henry.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.190
I'm going to bring her back to life.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.150
I must get on.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.870
Jonathan, what do you mean?

27:42.920 --> 27:44.110
Precisely what I say.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.830
But... such a thing is not
possible. You cannot just...

27:46.880 --> 27:49.550
It is perfectly possible,
Henry, believe me.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.670
I did such a thing, of
a rough sort, in Spain.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.590
"Of a rough sort?"

27:54.320 --> 27:57.070
Damn it, Jonathan, she's
my flesh and blood.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.460
And she is my heart and soul.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.710
What is magic to me, otherwise?

28:13.640 --> 28:15.070
How did it go?

28:15.120 --> 28:18.920
It is the problem of the
Johannites which concerns them.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
Of course, you are aware
of the Johannites?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.910
Aye.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.750
I fear, and I said it to them,

28:25.800 --> 28:29.350
that Mr Strange's book will
put fire into their hearts.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.910
Mr Lascelles is of the opinion

28:30.960 --> 28:35.270
~ that I should have an attorney
serve Mr Strange...
~ Forgive me, sir.

28:35.320 --> 28:39.070
I think you take the advice of
Mr Lascelles a little too freely.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.710
Do you indeed? Well, I may say
that it was you who suggested

28:41.760 --> 28:44.230
that I turn to him and Drawlight
in the first place.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.430
Yes, sir, I know...

28:45.480 --> 28:48.310
If I did not have Mr Lascelles,
I would be quite alone.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.590
Then Mr Strange would be free
to dictate the direction

28:50.640 --> 28:54.280
that English magic will take, and
spoil everything I have done.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.750
I will not have this
book, Childermass,

28:57.800 --> 29:00.150
and Mr Lascelles will
help me to ensure that.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.590
I do not think Mr Strange
will be publishing anything

29:02.640 --> 29:04.510
any time soon, sir.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.120
His wife is dead.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.280
Dead?

29:11.680 --> 29:14.880
She went walking in the
snow and caught a chill.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.660
Mr Strange will feel that very badly.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.150
"And so I beg of you, dear sir,

30:07.200 --> 30:09.630
"for the sake of any friendship
that once we enjoyed,

30:09.680 --> 30:11.230
"you tell me what magic you employed

30:11.280 --> 30:14.580
"to bring her Ladyship
back to the bloom of life.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.750
"Tell me but this one thing,
whatever magic it is,

30:17.800 --> 30:20.150
"and I promise you
I shall tell no-one

30:20.200 --> 30:22.670
"and that furthermore, I shall
put aside magic entirely,

30:22.720 --> 30:25.510
"cease to call myself magician,
and trouble you no more.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.750
"Your affectionate friend,
Jonathan Strange."

30:28.800 --> 30:30.350
What shall I do?

30:30.400 --> 30:33.230
Nothing, sir. There's no need. There
is already talk in Shropshire

30:33.280 --> 30:35.150
that he killed his
wife by black magic -

30:35.200 --> 30:36.910
that he has another wife somewhere.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.670
If it were now known he plans to
raise the original from the dead,

30:39.720 --> 30:42.230
as he did those Italians -
his reputation will be ruined.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.870
And no-one would buy his book.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.950
I rather think Mr Norrell was asking
what he should do to help.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.270
Were you not?

30:49.320 --> 30:52.190
Can we talk without the
servants present, sir?

30:52.240 --> 30:55.440
No, let's not talk without
the servants present.

30:58.760 --> 31:02.750
Strange has made his promise.
He's a man of his word.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.190
You and he can bring Mrs Strange
back between you, I'm sure.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.310
I presume you now understand
what went amiss with Lady Pole.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.950
She need not come back mad.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.560
Could we talk without the
servants present, sir?

31:33.040 --> 31:34.910
It is most vexing.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.150
I mean to say, his first
reaction when his wife dies

31:38.200 --> 31:40.390
is to turn to black magic.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.680
It is the measure of the man, sir.

31:44.680 --> 31:47.020
But perhaps Childermass is...

31:48.160 --> 31:49.870
Well, perhaps if I just explained...

31:49.920 --> 31:52.960
Childermass has his own reasons
for doing anything.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.990
Mr Strange has broken with you, sir.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.030
He has gone against your
wishes, time and again.

32:01.080 --> 32:05.790
Sir, all you have done is for
the good of English magic.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.960
You are the good of English magic.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.110
Do not allow your goodness
to be used against you.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.390
Yes, but...

32:14.440 --> 32:17.550
Write to him if you wish, but
I could not, in all conscience,

32:17.600 --> 32:21.200
stand by and see you inflict
such damage upon your own cause.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.740
I fear I could no longer
be your friend.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.360
TIMBERS CREAK

32:58.600 --> 33:00.510
Poor man.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.350
There is no need to
whisper, dear Stephen.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.230
He can neither see nor hear us.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.910
He is attempting to summon me.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.470
Ignorant fool.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.070
He may be ignorant, but
he still succeeded, sir.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.310
What?

33:14.360 --> 33:17.560
After all, you are here, sir.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.560
Yes, I dare say.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.750
But if I choose not to make
myself heard, nor seen,

33:26.800 --> 33:28.550
what use is that?

33:28.600 --> 33:32.270
Stephen, quick, turn
the pages of that book.

33:32.320 --> 33:36.020
There is no breeze in the room
and it will perplex him.

33:52.280 --> 33:56.590
Really, watching this
fellow try to do magic

33:56.640 --> 34:01.960
is like seeing a man sit down to eat
dinner with his coat on backwards.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.910
He has just lost his wife, sir.

34:06.960 --> 34:11.920
Yes - and what a delicious
irony that he summons me.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.909
Oh, give his neck a pinch, Stephen.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.230
He will think it is a gnat.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.510
It is said the Raven King brought
the son of a nobleman,

34:25.560 --> 34:27.350
with whom he quarrelled back to life.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.750
Henry Barbatus, died of a fever -

34:29.800 --> 34:32.909
the King had his body
dug up out of its grave.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.830
Perhaps it involved
some exchange of...

34:36.480 --> 34:38.270
.. the life of trees, or dogs, or...

34:38.320 --> 34:39.860
Jonathan...

34:40.760 --> 34:43.760
The Raven King was nothing
if not practical.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.300
You will not come back speaking
in the tongues of Hell.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.040
You will come back with
the voices of Heaven.

35:29.640 --> 35:32.000
Bell? Wake up.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.430
If you please.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.580
Please, wake up.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.540
I am sorry, my love.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.280
There.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.590
Nothing from Norrell. Nothing!

36:26.640 --> 36:28.710
It is seven days, Jonathan.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.900
One more day, I beg you.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.190
No, Jonathan. I believe in the
resurrection to eternal life.

36:34.240 --> 36:35.830
Norrell does not want to tell me.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.590
~ I will go to him. I will make him.
~ Jonathan, stop!

36:38.640 --> 36:39.830
Get out of my way.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.310
Do you honestly believe this
is what Arabella would wish?

36:42.360 --> 36:44.110
Do you think she would
be pleased with you?

36:44.160 --> 36:46.990
She would be alive, Henry.
I wish her to be alive!

36:47.040 --> 36:48.710
But she's dead.

36:49.520 --> 36:52.840
The corpse lying upstairs is no
longer your wife or my sister.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.550
What would it be if you
brought it back now?

36:57.600 --> 36:59.310
Please, stop.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.300
Please, respect her
and respect yourself.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.150
It breaks my heart
to say this, Jonathan.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.870
She's the only family
I will ever have.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.260
She's my most beloved sister.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.960
But she must... be let go.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.600
JONATHAN SOBS

37:52.640 --> 37:55.380
You were the very reason I did magic.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.480
You were the reason I did anything.

38:02.720 --> 38:06.360
The excitement of it was very much
to see how you would look at me.

38:12.280 --> 38:15.760
The excitement of life was very much
to see how you would look at me.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.520
Goodbye, my love.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.240
BELL TOLLS

38:38.160 --> 38:39.630
I know that my redeemer liveth

38:39.680 --> 38:43.230
and that I shall rise out of
the earth in the last day.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.790
And shall be covered
again with my skin.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.150
And shall see God in my flesh.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.070
Yea, and I myself shall behold him.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.270
Not with other, but
with these same eyes.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.590
For as much as it has
pleased Almighty God

38:56.640 --> 39:01.230
to take unto himself the soul of
our dear sister here departed,

39:01.280 --> 39:04.630
we therefore commit her
body to the ground.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.110
Earth to earth,

39:06.160 --> 39:07.950
ashes to ashes,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.190
dust to dust.

39:10.240 --> 39:14.350
In the sure and certain hope
of resurrection to eternal life,

39:14.400 --> 39:16.550
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.080
Amen.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.550
It seems a waste for you to have
come all this way, Stephen.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.600
Sir Walter wished you
to be told in person.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.110
He wishes me to stay by you.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.150
He considered you might
be very distressed

39:38.200 --> 39:39.710
by the death of Mrs Strange.

39:39.760 --> 39:42.830
I am very distressed
by what has happened.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.420
No-one is more distressed than I.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.030
I had considered at least it would
have given me someone to talk to.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.680
But she is so very, very far away.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.350
So it is, when someone is dead.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.790
Mr Black, my colleague and I consider

40:03.840 --> 40:07.070
we would fail in our duty of care
if we did not ask you something.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.390
What is it, gentleman?

40:08.440 --> 40:09.670
We know how impatient

40:09.720 --> 40:11.990
you and her Ladyship are of
magicians, sir, but, um...

40:12.040 --> 40:15.510
The nonsense that she speaks, sir - well,
we have been listening to it when it comes.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.590
I have been reading my old notes
and I believe it has a pattern, sir.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.910
We were wondering if you
think we might induce her

40:21.960 --> 40:23.910
to speak in that way,
in order to study...

40:23.960 --> 40:25.910
No. I think you may not.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.190
But, you see, sir, she
speaks in faerie tales,

40:28.240 --> 40:31.680
~ as we would call them...
~ Gentlemen. Do not meddle in such things.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.790
You have no idea where it will end.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.990
And you are not fit to do it.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.470
But, surely if we can help...

40:38.520 --> 40:41.230
No, you cannot. No-one can help.

40:41.280 --> 40:44.220
We must accept that
she cannot be cured.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.800
And yourself?

40:50.880 --> 40:53.280
You do not have my permission.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.880
And I do not want
any more talk of it.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.790
Did you see it?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.630
No.

41:07.680 --> 41:10.190
Well, I see it plainly
on both of them.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.110
I vote we go ahead.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.350
You are changed.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.700
Truth to tell, I was not
quite myself for a time.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.940
Would you give this to Lady Pole?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.870
I think Bell would be pleased
to know that your wife

41:54.920 --> 41:56.510
had something to remember her by.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.960
I'm sure she would be most comforted.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.600
You have not given up magic, then?

42:05.440 --> 42:07.710
It is just... I had heard...

42:08.480 --> 42:10.350
What had you heard?

42:13.840 --> 42:16.590
I am no longer a practical magician.

42:16.640 --> 42:19.640
That does not mean I
have abandoned magic.

42:20.240 --> 42:24.070
Norrell is in agonies whenever
your book is mentioned.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.520
Agonies?

42:26.800 --> 42:29.510
Well, the book is only the beginning.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.310
I mean to say, when you
consider the matter,

42:32.360 --> 42:36.150
what does our so-called "restoration
of English magic" really amount to?

42:36.200 --> 42:39.070
What have Norrell
and I actually done?

42:39.120 --> 42:42.590
Illusions. Storms and bad weather.
His silly sea-beacons.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.150
He still has not completed them.

42:44.200 --> 42:47.550
Compare our sorry reckoning with
the magicians of the Golden Age.

42:47.600 --> 42:51.310
They transformed themselves
into mice, foxes, rivers.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.230
They made ships out of cobwebs
and houses out of rose-bushes...

42:55.280 --> 42:57.110
Mr Strange, I...

42:57.160 --> 42:59.950
I do not much like saying it,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.550
but it occurs to me
Norrell may be right.

43:03.600 --> 43:06.190
These kinds of magic will
not suit us nowadays.

43:06.240 --> 43:09.670
How can you say that when none
of us knows what magic it is?

43:09.720 --> 43:13.350
No, we must turn our attention to the
life and magic of the Raven King,

43:13.400 --> 43:15.310
~ and when we do...
~ I am sorry, Mr Strange.

43:15.360 --> 43:18.100
That is the one thing we must not do.

43:20.120 --> 43:23.120
I am serious. I tell
you this as a friend.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.750
Too much talk of other kings

43:25.800 --> 43:28.740
is bound to make the
Government nervous.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.350
How can we restore English magic

43:31.400 --> 43:33.750
until we know what it is we're
supposed to be restoring?

43:33.800 --> 43:36.150
We do not require English
magic to be restored

43:36.200 --> 43:38.800
any more than it already has been.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.950
Leave John Uskglass in the obscurity
Mr Norrell has placed him.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.990
Norrell has poisoned your minds.
Literally, in your case.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
Do you not consider...

43:49.640 --> 43:52.840
Do you not consider what
happened to your wife?

43:54.400 --> 43:57.140
Do you not question why she went mad?

44:01.480 --> 44:03.720
THUNDERCLAP

44:05.480 --> 44:07.590
~ This idea is madness.
~ Madness is what it is not.

44:07.640 --> 44:11.470
~ Whatever you hope to gain from this...
~ My liberty, Stephen -

44:11.520 --> 44:12.830
mine and hers.

44:12.880 --> 44:15.480
~ You cannot fight him.
~ .. Page 72.

44:18.080 --> 44:22.590
Mrs Strange. She doesn't
know what is done.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.240
She is happy.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.900
You and I...

44:27.920 --> 44:30.230
We have survived, so far.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.790
What would you suggest, Stephen?

44:32.840 --> 44:35.760
We should accept our position...

44:37.240 --> 44:39.440
.. and be thankful for it.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.760
He has poisoned your mind.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.230
So, gentlemen - what are we to do?

44:54.280 --> 44:57.160
Try and, er... describe...

44:58.160 --> 45:00.900
.. what most distresses you, my lady.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.710
~ 'Bell, no! It's me!
~ BELLS JINGLE AND ECHO

45:09.760 --> 45:11.110
'Bell!'

45:11.160 --> 45:14.470
There was once a Christian who went
hunting in a wood of wych-elm.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.830
His horse got its hoof caught in
a rabbit-hole and he tumbled in.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.110
He found himself in
a strange country,

45:20.160 --> 45:23.430
lit by its own sun and
nurtured by its own rain.

45:23.480 --> 45:27.030
In a wood very much like
the one he had just left,

45:27.080 --> 45:29.270
he found a brugh where
a party of gentlemen -

45:29.320 --> 45:31.830
some of them rather odd
- were playing napdraw.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.670
Here. The Huntsman
And The Rabbit-Hole.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.670
Er... but you heard her say "brugh"?

45:36.720 --> 45:39.150
~ Hmm. And, um, "napdraw" - what is that?
~ Er...

45:39.200 --> 45:40.550
I think it is a card game,

45:40.600 --> 45:43.600
rather like what we would
call "Spoil Five".

45:44.920 --> 45:47.510
I think it best if you
speak generally, my lady.

45:47.560 --> 45:50.910
If you aim right for the truth, you
veer off at even stranger angles.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.500
~ Yes.
~ Speak around it, this time.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.830
There was once a farmer of Harrogate,

46:00.880 --> 46:02.230
who desired very greatly...

46:02.280 --> 46:05.830
~ KNOCKS AT DOOR
~ .. to grow broad beans bigger
than any in Yorkshire.

46:05.880 --> 46:09.190
To this end, he enlisted the
assistance of Col Tom Blue,

46:09.240 --> 46:11.790
who helped him grow beans
as large as a man's foot.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.270
KNOCKS AT DOOR

46:13.320 --> 46:16.790
~ Madam. Please, we must stop this.
~ Go on.

46:16.840 --> 46:20.270
Col Tom Blue had enchanted the beans

46:20.320 --> 46:23.790
as a means to capture the souls
of the little children.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.950
The little children
were then carried off

46:26.000 --> 46:27.950
to the Castles of the Five.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.430
~ I have it. She said "Castles of the Five."
~ KNOCKS AT DOOR

46:31.480 --> 46:34.870
That's a common story about
a faerie, but he is unnamed.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.750
You called him "Col Tom Blue".

46:36.800 --> 46:38.340
THUNDERCLAP

46:39.280 --> 46:41.710
I think what you are telling,
my lady, are faerie tales -

46:41.760 --> 46:45.310
but told, in some way, from the point
of view of the faerie himself.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.550
"Human tales", as it were.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.520
KNOCKS AT DOOR

46:50.520 --> 46:51.870
Is this the madhouse?

46:51.920 --> 46:53.630
Yes, it most certainly is.

46:53.680 --> 46:57.070
I've a madman for you. He's blue.

46:57.120 --> 46:58.350
Blue?

46:58.400 --> 47:02.190
With your permission, madam, we
would like to write to Mr Strange.

47:02.240 --> 47:03.870
Yes. Please!

47:03.920 --> 47:05.790
Mr Segundus, Mr Honeyfoot?

47:05.840 --> 47:07.640
Excuse us, ma'am.

47:14.800 --> 47:17.790
I don't know, he's been going
round markets pinching,

47:17.840 --> 47:21.550
shouting all sorts of nonsense
about "Raven King".

47:21.600 --> 47:24.070
I need all of you to bring him.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.270
~ What is the matter?
~ Madman.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.580
I've met you before.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.590
And you.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.230
I have a message for you...

47:37.280 --> 47:38.950
nameless slave.

47:39.840 --> 47:42.160
~ VINCULUS CACKLES
~ Unhand me.

47:43.320 --> 47:46.960
~ The rain shall make a door for
me and I shall go through it.
~ Unhand me!

47:54.440 --> 47:57.990
Do you see anything in this that
might be called seditious?

47:58.040 --> 48:01.040
I see that he will tear
England to pieces.

48:01.880 --> 48:06.590
I see that he will spoil magic
for generations to come.

48:06.640 --> 48:09.470
Why did you not let me
have my magical court?

48:09.520 --> 48:11.790
From what I understand
from my man at Murray's,

48:11.840 --> 48:15.110
there is no direct call for the
restoration of the Raven King.

48:15.160 --> 48:18.310
But such a call would
not be against the law -

48:18.360 --> 48:20.950
as it currently stands.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.640
May we keep this... for a while?

48:25.560 --> 48:27.700
We will remain in touch.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.870
I do not know how
I shall prevent him.

48:36.920 --> 48:37.950
I do not know.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.030
Oh, what do you want
to prevent him for?

48:41.080 --> 48:44.120
Call a halt to this
bloody stupid feud.

48:45.440 --> 48:47.830
~ It won't end well for you both.
~ Join him, if you wish.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.950
Join him and Murray and
the other traitors.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.710
I'm not going anywhere. Don't worry.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.350
That is a shame.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.830
I agree with you, though.

48:54.880 --> 48:58.680
Between us, I'm sure we can
put a halt to Strange's book.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.350
Childermass?

49:12.400 --> 49:13.940
Is that you?

49:22.800 --> 49:24.940
I've been expecting you.

49:25.960 --> 49:27.830
How is your master?

49:29.120 --> 49:31.270
Poorly, sir.

49:31.320 --> 49:34.110
Colds and headaches and
tremblings in the limbs.

49:34.160 --> 49:37.830
All the usual symptoms when
someone has vexed him.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.590
And no-one vexes him as you do.

49:40.640 --> 49:44.230
And what does he think about you
turning yourself into shadows

49:44.280 --> 49:46.680
and making yourself invisible?

49:47.800 --> 49:50.950
I have been 18 years
in Mr Norrell's service,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.550
and before that, I was a pickpocket.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.510
I would have to be a dull fellow
to have learnt nothing at all.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.910
That was not what I asked.

49:59.960 --> 50:03.000
Well, come and see what
you were sent to see.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.590
I have nothing to hide.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.820
They are very beautiful.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.560
I aim for the whole book
to be a work of beauty.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.590
So, these are the King's Roads?

50:21.760 --> 50:23.670
Built by the Raven King himself.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.990
What is the country that
the bridges cross?

50:27.040 --> 50:28.710
I do not know.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.750
What is your opinion, Magician?

50:39.040 --> 50:41.110
I suppose it is Faerie.

50:43.280 --> 50:45.420
Was the magic difficult?

50:47.120 --> 50:50.230
You need a spell of revelation
- I used Doncaster -

50:50.280 --> 50:53.110
and another of dissolution,
to melt the mirror's surface.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.430
~ Do you follow me?
~ Yes, sir.

50:57.880 --> 51:00.590
Have these landscapes
always been there?

51:00.640 --> 51:02.590
I believe so.

51:02.640 --> 51:05.430
Well, why have magicians not
been able to go about upon them?

51:05.480 --> 51:09.150
These roads were all closed,
hidden behind mirrors.

51:09.200 --> 51:14.030
But now, something has occurred
to open up them up again.

51:14.080 --> 51:17.910
Now, there is more magic in England
than either you or I can understand.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.960
I think that is true.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.750
Is it not time, Childermass,

51:23.800 --> 51:27.070
that you left Gilbert Norrell's
service and came to me?

51:27.120 --> 51:29.630
There need be none of
this "servant" nonsense.

51:29.680 --> 51:32.350
You would be my pupil and assistant.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.840
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

51:38.040 --> 51:41.350
But Mr Norrell and I are not
done with each other yet.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.750
And besides, I think I would
make a very bad pupil.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.800
Worse, even, than you.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.110
Was I so very bad?

51:53.040 --> 51:54.350
I merely asked questions.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.470
Surely that is the
prerogative of any pupil?

51:56.520 --> 51:59.150
I do not know how it will
end with you and Norrell,

51:59.200 --> 52:01.470
but I tell you what I'll do.

52:02.080 --> 52:05.880
If you fail and Norrell wins,
I shall leave his service.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.430
I'll take up your cause,

52:08.480 --> 52:11.190
and then there will still
be two magicians in England

52:11.240 --> 52:13.510
and two opinions upon magic.

52:14.120 --> 52:17.150
But, if he should fail and you win,

52:17.200 --> 52:19.540
I'll do the same against you.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.660
Good enough?

52:30.040 --> 52:31.240
Yes.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.550
Thank you for your frankness, sir.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.800
It is Norrell who likes
to keep secrets, not I.

52:38.560 --> 52:41.470
Besides, I have told you nothing
that is not already in my book.

52:41.520 --> 52:44.110
Within a month, every man,
woman and child in the kingdom

52:44.160 --> 52:47.950
will be able to read it and
form his own opinions on it.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.510
Which is just as it should be.

52:49.560 --> 52:52.950
Regarding that, sir - I think
I should warn you to be careful.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.790
Of what?

52:54.840 --> 52:56.790
Of your book, sir.

52:56.840 --> 53:00.140
~ What do you mean?
~ He's trying to have it stopped.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.190
How?

53:02.240 --> 53:03.870
By whatever means he can, I think.

53:03.920 --> 53:05.520
God damn him.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.710
God damn him.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.070
What have I ever done
to him, Childermass?

53:12.120 --> 53:15.720
What did I ever do, apart
from be frank and pleasant?

53:16.080 --> 53:18.710
This book will stand
as tribute to my wife.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.910
~ Mr Strange...
~ God damn him!

53:21.960 --> 53:23.160
No!

53:24.960 --> 53:26.560
Bloody idiot!

53:30.880 --> 53:34.750
Mr Norrell! Mr Norrell!

53:34.800 --> 53:36.870
It is your former pupil
and former friend!

53:36.920 --> 53:38.670
Mr Norrell is not at home, sir...

53:38.720 --> 53:40.320
Oh!

53:41.600 --> 53:44.310
Mr Norrell! What is this?
You quarrel with my book?

53:44.360 --> 53:47.150
Your book cannot be published,
sir. We will not allow it.

53:47.200 --> 53:49.910
Why? What on earth does
it matter? Leave me be!

53:49.960 --> 53:51.990
Do you not consider you
have hurt me enough?

53:52.040 --> 53:54.310
Do you not consider you have
hurt Mr Norrell enough?

53:54.360 --> 53:57.230
What hurt? I wrote, begging with
everything I could offer BELL RINGS

53:57.280 --> 53:59.750
that he help do for my wife
what he did for Lady Pole!

53:59.800 --> 54:01.750
I pleaded, sir, on any condition,

54:01.800 --> 54:05.400
that he help me bring my wife
back, and he did not even reply.

54:08.520 --> 54:10.390
What was the magic?

54:11.920 --> 54:14.060
Why will you not tell me?

54:14.640 --> 54:16.270
I know why.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.860
I know why!

54:29.280 --> 54:30.750
Charlatan!

54:31.840 --> 54:33.190
GLASS SHATTERS

54:33.240 --> 54:34.830
You're no friend of mine!

54:34.880 --> 54:37.550
~ Hey!
~ Housebreaker!
~ Hold him there!

54:40.440 --> 54:42.240
Get on your feet.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.380
Merlin.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.840
I'm here to help you.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.790
The most terrible things
are being done against you.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.960
They seek to arraign you for
breaking into Norrell's house.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.030
They say I killed Bell.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.670
They say that if a charge can
be found under modern law,

55:28.720 --> 55:31.820
they plan to try you for
murder by witchcraft.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.590
Ah.

55:33.640 --> 55:35.910
So, what do you mean to do?

55:36.800 --> 55:38.910
I shall summon a faerie.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.150
I do not think that germane
to your situation.

55:41.200 --> 55:45.190
You are wrong. You wonder if
such a thing is even possible.

55:45.240 --> 55:48.400
The received opinion is that faeries
do not visit England any more.

55:49.680 --> 55:53.670
But I tell you, I was in company
with one at Windsor Castle.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.720
No magician, of any era, could
help me as much as a faerie.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.350
I've tried every spell
I know, this way and that.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.230
Nothing seems to work.

56:02.280 --> 56:04.550
But then I thought on it.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.950
I did not see the faerie.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.790
That is the difficulty
- to see and hear them.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.510
Yet there was one present who
perceived him very clearly.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.950
Why could he, when I could not?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.910
Merlin, let me bring you out of here.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.960
It is very important
that I do this, Grant.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.670
Well, was this fellow a magician?

56:25.720 --> 56:28.920
No, no. This man was just... mad.

56:34.560 --> 56:37.470
Now, what must be done is
to get you away from here.

56:37.520 --> 56:40.030
We will enlist Sir Wellington's help.

56:40.080 --> 56:44.080
Sir - open this door. This is
the Duke of Wellington's man!

56:45.880 --> 56:47.590
He will not have you slandered so.

56:47.640 --> 56:50.670
But then again, madness is
not such a very queer notion.

56:50.720 --> 56:52.910
Think of the magicians
of the Golden Age.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.950
They were the faeries' near-neighbours

56:55.000 --> 56:57.310
in wildness, insanity...

56:57.360 --> 56:59.150
Perhaps I am too tame...

56:59.200 --> 57:00.710
Mr Strange, listen...

57:00.760 --> 57:04.590
But how does one work up
a little madness in oneself?

57:04.640 --> 57:06.230
Perhaps I should go wandering.

57:06.280 --> 57:09.310
Perhaps the wilderness
will make me mad.

57:09.360 --> 57:13.190
I think you've hit upon something,
Grant. My book is finished.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.270
London is set against me.

57:15.320 --> 57:18.030
It is time for me to become the
magician I am destined to become.

57:18.080 --> 57:21.510
Merlin, you cannot propose that you
purposely become a... a lunatic.

57:21.560 --> 57:23.470
You'll only help your enemies.

57:23.520 --> 57:26.590
What must be done now is
to take you away from here.

57:26.640 --> 57:28.270
My man...

57:28.320 --> 57:30.760
Gaoler? Gaoler?

57:31.760 --> 57:33.630
Come on, man.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.150
Unlock this door.

57:35.200 --> 57:38.140
~ Look sharp.
~ At the double, man. Come on.

57:39.120 --> 57:41.390
Come on, man. At the double.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.270
Merlin?

57:48.320 --> 57:50.860
~ The prisoner is missing.
~ Guards!

57:51.400 --> 57:54.910
~ The magician has escaped.
~ Guards, search the jail.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.760
Move it, move it!
