03:36.383 --> 03:38.301
Hello?

03:40.303 --> 03:43.306
<i> 'Morning.</i>

03:43.306 --> 03:45.225
What is this?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.019
<i>How ya feeling?</i>

03:48.187 --> 03:50.605
<i>Whoa, whoa, easy.</i>

03:50.605 --> 03:54.651
<i>Might want to give it a bit</i> <i>before going for a stroll.</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:57.071
What happened?

03:57.071 --> 03:58.780
<i>You don't remember?</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:03.952
I was shot.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.082
In the back.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.250
<i>Really?</i>

04:10.250 --> 04:11.960
Some kind of neutralizer.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.921
<i>Oh, gotcha.</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:17.257
<i>I thought you meant, you</i> <i>know, like shot, shot.</i>

04:22.637 --> 04:24.389
Is this...

04:31.188 --> 04:32.940
<i>What's your name?</i>

04:36.443 --> 04:37.611
Frank.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.196
<i>Frank.</i>

04:39.196 --> 04:40.280
Yeah.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.324
<i>I am your LSO.</i>

04:43.324 --> 04:45.786
What does that mean?

04:45.786 --> 04:47.662
<i>You can call me Howard.</i>

04:47.662 --> 04:49.289
No, what is LSO?

04:49.289 --> 04:50.457
What does...

04:57.464 --> 05:00.050
Hello?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.802
Hello!!?

05:01.802 --> 05:06.306
<i>Yes, yep, sorry, just</i> <i>getting set up here.</i>

05:07.599 --> 05:09.893
What am I doing here?

05:09.893 --> 05:12.104
<i>Is that rhetorical?</i>

05:12.104 --> 05:15.065
No, what is this place?

05:15.065 --> 05:18.277
<i>That was covered in</i> <i>admissions and staging.</i>

05:18.277 --> 05:20.154
Ha, I don't even know how I got here.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.615
I didn't...no one's told me anything.

05:23.615 --> 05:27.995
<i>I'm only here to acclimate you</i> <i>to ISN Habitat and Service.</i>

05:34.417 --> 05:36.377
I've been arrested...

05:39.631 --> 05:43.468
This is a...

05:43.468 --> 05:46.263
I've been detained,

05:46.263 --> 05:48.890
by the ISN?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.642
<i>I don't have that information.</i>

05:50.642 --> 05:52.144
But I haven't done anything wrong.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.062
What am I being charged with?

05:54.062 --> 05:56.523
<i>You're not being</i> <i>charged with anything,</i>

05:56.523 --> 05:59.442
<i>you're being processed.</i>

05:59.442 --> 06:01.153
Processed.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.825
Listen.

06:06.825 --> 06:11.079
I don't know what you think I've done, or who you think I am,

06:11.079 --> 06:12.998
but it's a mistake.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.373
I don't have a record.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.584
I've never been arrested before.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.753
I have nothing to do with the ISN.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.923
I am a civilian.

06:21.923 --> 06:26.678
So, can you check?

06:26.678 --> 06:29.097
<i>I don't have access.</i>

06:29.097 --> 06:30.849
What does that mean?

06:30.849 --> 06:35.478
<i>That's not how</i> <i>this program works.</i>

06:35.478 --> 06:37.689
How does it work?

06:41.609 --> 06:44.403
Do I get a phone call?

06:44.403 --> 06:46.990
<i>I don't think so.</i>

06:46.990 --> 06:49.159
How about a lawyer?

06:49.159 --> 06:50.994
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

06:56.666 --> 06:58.793
What do you know?

06:58.793 --> 07:02.547
<i>I know my job.</i>

07:02.547 --> 07:05.675
And what would that be?

07:05.675 --> 07:08.762
<i>I'm here to keep</i> <i>you alive, Frank.</i>

07:11.598 --> 07:13.392
<i>Shall we get started?</i>

07:59.354 --> 08:02.565
<i>I've got three different</i> <i>flavors, orange citrus,</i>

08:02.565 --> 08:07.321
<i>tropical berry and ah, well,</i> <i>regular water...</i>

08:07.321 --> 08:10.282
<i>Oh, coffee too,</i> <i>make that four flavors.</i>

08:11.158 --> 08:12.575
<i>Want one?</i>

08:12.575 --> 08:14.202
No.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.788
<i>Do you want something to eat?</i>

08:16.788 --> 08:18.039
No, I'm not...

08:18.039 --> 08:19.791
<i>Want to hear some music?</i>

08:19.791 --> 08:21.668
Music, seriously?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.753
<i>Yeah, I've got a small library,</i> <i>assorted genres,</i>

08:23.753 --> 08:25.964
<i>classical, jazz, new age.</i>

08:25.964 --> 08:27.424
No.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.425
<i>Do you want to...</i>

08:28.425 --> 08:29.592
No.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.303
<i>...go for a walk?</i>

08:31.303 --> 08:32.595
A walk?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.597
<i>Yeah, stretch the legs.</i>

08:34.597 --> 08:36.057
Yeah, sure, okay.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.707
How long you planning on keeping me here?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.001
<i>Until you're processed.</i>

09:03.001 --> 09:04.711
When is that gonna start?

09:04.711 --> 09:07.588
<i>I don't have that information.</i>

09:07.588 --> 09:09.674
Ah, can I talk to your supervisor?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.343
Please?

09:11.343 --> 09:13.887
<i>I don't have a supervisor.</i>

09:13.887 --> 09:16.014
How can that be?

09:16.014 --> 09:19.059
<i>It's a server-based program,</i> <i>operating off the GSL protocol.</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
A computer is your supervisor.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.229
<i>Well, no...</i>

09:22.229 --> 09:23.813
Listen, there is...

09:23.813 --> 09:25.524
<i>...I guess you</i> <i>could say that, but-</i>

09:25.524 --> 09:27.192
There has to be someone who knows someone

09:27.192 --> 09:28.902
who knows something about why I'm here.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.987
Could you, could you talk to them, please?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.864
<i>What's your last name?</i>

09:32.864 --> 09:35.909
Lerner, Lerner.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.869
<i>Frank Lerner.</i>

09:41.664 --> 09:44.084
So, are you gonna check?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.627
<i>On what?</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:49.005
On why I'm here.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.550
<i>I don't have access.</i>

09:56.137 --> 09:57.680
Listen.

10:01.309 --> 10:05.105
You can't keep me here without telling me why, right?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.190
I have rights.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.734
At least the right to know why I was brought here.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.611
<i>That was covered in the video.</i>

10:11.611 --> 10:13.572
I didn't see the god damn video.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.156
I was shot. I was asleep.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.908
I was knocked out!

10:16.908 --> 10:19.327
This has been an error and you can't even check?

10:19.327 --> 10:20.870
<i>I don't have access.</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:23.415
Of course not, of course not!

10:49.941 --> 10:51.692
<i>...demanding the release of</i>

10:51.692 --> 10:53.736
<i>Fletcher May, leader</i> <i>of the Alliance,</i>

10:53.736 --> 10:56.448
<i>whose mysterious disappearance</i> <i>has sparked outrage</i>

10:56.448 --> 10:58.533
<i>among LFO sympathizers.</i>

10:58.533 --> 11:00.201
<i>Charges of illegal detainment</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:02.203
<i>and military</i> <i>strong-armed tactics</i>

11:02.203 --> 11:04.872
<i>have only fueled the</i> <i>volatile situation between</i>

11:04.872 --> 11:08.668
<i>the ISN security units and</i> <i>civil rights activists.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:11.421
<i>The White House</i> <i>Press Secretary,</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:11.421
<i>Edward Baeza has denied</i>

11:11.421 --> 11:14.048
<i>any involvement or knowledge</i> <i>of May's disappearance</i>

11:14.048 --> 11:17.177
<i>as administrative officials</i> <i>seek a cease fire between</i>

11:17.177 --> 11:20.972
<i>armed militants and the GR</i> <i>police force security units.</i>

11:25.852 --> 11:28.687
No one even knows.

11:28.687 --> 11:32.484
<i>About what?</i>

11:32.484 --> 11:34.986
What happened to me.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.198
Friends, family.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.411
I just vanished.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.890
<i>So, where are ya from?</i>

12:06.476 --> 12:08.853
I'm from the south side.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.104
<i>Really?</i>

12:10.104 --> 12:11.606
<i>Is that where you grew up?</i>

12:11.606 --> 12:13.316
Where are you from?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.569
Or do you not have that information?

12:15.569 --> 12:16.695
<i>I'm from Austin.</i>

12:16.695 --> 12:18.737
<i>Texas.</i>

12:18.737 --> 12:20.948
You don't sound like you're from Texas.

12:20.948 --> 12:24.452
<i>Born there, but I grew up in a</i> <i>small town outside of Seattle,</i>

12:24.452 --> 12:26.829
<i>a place not many</i> <i>people have heard of.</i>

12:26.829 --> 12:28.747
Really?

12:31.292 --> 12:34.753
That's fascinating.

12:34.753 --> 12:40.468
Why would a small town boy like you, ah join up with the ISN?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.721
<i>It's a job, I guess.</i>

12:42.721 --> 12:45.557
It's a job.

12:45.557 --> 12:48.851
Doing this to people.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.769
You know there used to be laws against this.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.565
Civil rights, Miranda.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.191
Due process?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.401
Constitution?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.486
Any of this ring a bell?

12:58.486 --> 13:01.615
<i>That's not my department.</i>

13:01.615 --> 13:04.701
You, you're just a button pusher.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.911
I mean even with automated protocol that doesn't really

13:06.911 --> 13:09.830
fly anymore, Howard, does it?

13:09.830 --> 13:11.583
I mean take a little accountability

13:11.583 --> 13:14.001
for what you're a part of.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.879
You're the one keeping me here.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.550
This is your department.

13:20.550 --> 13:25.430
It's not just serving drinks, taking song requests, is it?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.806
<i>What do you do for a job?</i>

13:29.768 --> 13:31.936
Christ.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.024
You're something else, I'll give you that.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.860
You're a piece of work.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.449
You said there was something to eat?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.950
<i>Yeah, yeah okay.</i>

13:45.950 --> 13:47.285
<i>I've got three</i> <i>different flavors.</i>

13:47.285 --> 13:50.997
<i>Chicken, beef and vegetable.</i>

13:50.997 --> 13:53.750
<i>What do ya wanna try?</i>

13:53.750 --> 13:55.960
Whatever.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.561
How long have I been in here?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.313
<i>Umm, I don't know.</i>

14:15.313 --> 14:18.941
<i>You were asleep</i> <i>when I signed on.</i>

14:18.941 --> 14:21.486
I need you to check the files or whatever

14:21.486 --> 14:23.363
to see if someone went to my apartment.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.947
<i>What's in your apartment?</i>

14:24.947 --> 14:26.115
Look, after my arrest I just need to know

14:26.115 --> 14:27.367
if someone went there.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.786
<i>Why's that?</i>

14:29.786 --> 14:31.705
I have a dog.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.499
<i>You have a dog?</i>

14:34.499 --> 14:37.794
I know it may seem silly but no one knows he's there, so...

14:37.794 --> 14:40.880
<i>What kind of dog?</i>

14:40.880 --> 14:43.924
He's, he's locked inside, do you understand?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.885
So he could bark all day and no one would care.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.805
He will die if no one shows up.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.014
<i>That's horrible.</i>

14:50.014 --> 14:52.016
No shit!

14:52.016 --> 14:53.685
Could you make a phone call, could you check,

14:53.685 --> 14:56.229
could you contact someone, please?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
<i>I can't do that.</i>

14:58.231 --> 15:00.066
You can't make a phone call?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.609
You can't send a text?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.361
Just to see if someone went there.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.196
Just to make sure he's taken care of.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.281
I don't need to know.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.703
Please, please.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.832
Please?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.208
<i>That's not how</i> <i>the program works.</i>

15:17.208 --> 15:21.212
Ah, Jesus, God...the program!

15:23.631 --> 15:26.092
Son of a bitch!

16:49.592 --> 16:52.011
I need water.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.948
Can I...

17:11.948 --> 17:14.408
have some water please, Howard?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.494
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:20.540
<i>Want to try one of the flavors?</i>

17:20.540 --> 17:22.917
Just water please.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.434
<i>What happened over here?</i>

17:42.395 --> 17:45.147
Where am I supposed to go?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.483
You didn't give me a bucket.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.654
<i>Next time just ask</i> <i>to use the bathroom.</i>

17:51.654 --> 17:53.531
The bathroom?

18:32.987 --> 18:36.115
What the...who did this?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.076
Did you come in here?

18:38.076 --> 18:39.786
<i>Just a little room service.</i>

18:40.995 --> 18:45.458
Yeah... but how?

18:51.756 --> 18:55.134
<i>You done with the</i> <i>bathroom, Frank?</i>

19:29.085 --> 19:30.878
What can I get ya?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.630
Hey, ah coffee?

19:32.630 --> 19:33.923
What flavor?

19:33.923 --> 19:35.133
Just regular coffee.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.051
Boosts, room for meds?

19:37.051 --> 19:38.302
No.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.179
Alright, you're easy.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.591
Jesus!

20:17.591 --> 20:19.177
<i>Want to try a different flavor?</i>

20:19.177 --> 20:20.260
Which one's this?

20:20.260 --> 20:23.139
<i>Vegetable.</i>

20:23.139 --> 20:26.767
<i>May not seem like much, but it</i> <i>does have everything you need.</i>

20:26.767 --> 20:28.268
<i>Vitamins and minerals.</i>

20:28.268 --> 20:30.270
Have you tasted it?

20:30.270 --> 20:32.899
<i>I don't have that information.</i>

20:34.358 --> 20:35.943
Wait a sec, what does that mean?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.611
<i>Which part?</i>

20:40.948 --> 20:42.324
Howard?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

20:49.040 --> 20:50.041
Howard.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.001
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

20:56.338 --> 20:57.423
Howard.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.550
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

20:59.550 --> 21:00.593
Howard.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.511
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

21:03.179 --> 21:04.222
Howard.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.932
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

21:09.351 --> 21:10.728
Howard.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.605
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

21:14.190 --> 21:15.357
Howard!

21:15.357 --> 21:17.151
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

21:17.151 --> 21:19.278
You gotta be kidding me.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.366
<i>About what?</i>

21:24.366 --> 21:27.161
How did I not see that?

21:27.161 --> 21:29.288
<i>See what?</i>

21:31.832 --> 21:34.293
I'm talking to a computer.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.965
I'm talking to a computer...

22:01.237 --> 22:03.030
Get me out of here!

22:03.030 --> 22:05.116
<i>Frank, please I can</i> <i>answer any questions.</i>

22:05.116 --> 22:07.660
Help me, answer questions?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.036
You haven't answered one.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.871
You don't know anything.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.665
You don't have that information.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.169
You get a real person on the line or down here

22:16.169 --> 22:18.545
because I am done debating with you, Howard.

22:18.545 --> 22:19.713
I am done!

22:19.713 --> 22:20.840
<i>I'm not debating.</i>

22:20.840 --> 22:22.049
Hey, hey, you hear me?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.260
I am done... Done!

22:24.260 --> 22:28.055
I'm not going to do circles with a fucking Speak and Spell.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.890
<i>I'm not sure that's the brand.</i>

22:29.890 --> 22:31.934
Oh, God yeah, and one with a humor response program.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.394
Thank you, thank you, Lord.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.230
A little weak on the disposition there, Howard,

22:36.230 --> 22:39.066
but the assorted inflections are impressive.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.652
I mean almost palpable.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.821
Real impressive.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.447
<i>Thanks.</i>

22:45.447 --> 22:47.783
That's sarcasm, Howard, that's sarcasm.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.120
Obviously not one of your faster applications.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.788
Oh my, God.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.414
God...

22:54.414 --> 22:57.960
Rrrrrrrrrgh!

23:04.591 --> 23:05.885
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.136
You said you were from Austin.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.262
You grew up outside Seattle.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.763
What is that bullshit?

23:09.763 --> 23:12.308
<i>I was built at HRS in Austin.</i>

23:12.308 --> 23:16.229
<i>I was programmed</i> <i>at Tech-Tronics</i>

23:12.308 --> 23:16.229
<i>outside of Seattle.</i>

23:16.229 --> 23:20.858
Oh, that's, that's cute, real cute.

23:20.858 --> 23:25.403
What are you, IR7, maybe IR8?

23:25.403 --> 23:27.365
<i>Twelve.</i>

23:27.365 --> 23:30.326
I take it back. Quite a piece of machinery.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.997
I should feel honored to have such an expensive piece of gear

23:34.997 --> 23:37.499
making me dinner, watching me take a crap.

23:37.499 --> 23:38.834
<i>Sarcasm?</i>

23:38.834 --> 23:40.878
And it learns.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.129
AI5?

23:42.129 --> 23:43.839
<i>Six.</i>

23:43.839 --> 23:45.841
<i>You seem to know</i> <i>a lot about computers.</i>

23:45.841 --> 23:49.345
Enough.

23:49.345 --> 23:53.473
Personally, I despise them.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.518
<i>Why's that?</i>

23:56.518 --> 23:59.188
Take a wild guess.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.773
<i>Well I'd imagine it'd</i> <i>have something to do...</i>

24:00.773 --> 24:02.482
Actually, don't guess.

24:02.482 --> 24:05.194
I can do without it.

24:10.324 --> 24:17.248
Some things, Howard are not meant to be computerized.

24:17.248 --> 24:19.457
<i>What does that mean?</i>

24:33.555 --> 24:37.059
Larry?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.769
Huh?

24:38.769 --> 24:41.021
Larry.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.189
I don't understand.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.233
You've been in before.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.525
Ah, no.

24:45.525 --> 24:48.821
I've never, my name's not Larry.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.989
Thank you.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.657
You're welcome, Pete.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.492
No, no, don't, don't tell me.

25:20.686 --> 25:24.231
Dave.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.317
Do you like it?

25:26.317 --> 25:27.693
The photo.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.404
Yes I do and no, not Dave.

25:30.404 --> 25:31.905
I took it.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.367
Really?

25:34.367 --> 25:38.704
Couldn't make a living out of it, but that's my thing.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.789
They're beautiful.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.292
Thanks.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.461
Give me your hand.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.422
C'mon, c'mon, give me, give me your hand.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.684
Frank.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.728
How'd you know that?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.688
It's another one of my things.

26:04.688 --> 26:08.067
Can't make a living out of the either, so I make coffee.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.486
Wasn't my first guess.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.490
I'm not one that's easily impressed...

26:14.490 --> 26:16.574
Gabby.

26:16.574 --> 26:19.078
But I'm impressed.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.967
Do you like it?

28:41.387 --> 28:44.723
The photo.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.266
Yeah, I do.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.227
I took it.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.982
Couldn't make a living out of it but, that's my thing.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.612
It's beautiful.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.698
Thanks.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.745
Ah, maybe I should have made you an espresso.

29:09.956 --> 29:13.960
Oh, ahh, no.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.671
Fine. Thanks.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.130
Sorry, thanks.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.299
You're welcome.

29:21.801 --> 29:24.763
Give me your hand, c'mon, c'mon.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.900
Frank.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.696
No, just, just stop, just stop, stop it, stop it!

29:48.495 --> 29:51.582
<i>Frank.</i>

29:51.582 --> 29:53.875
<i>What happened?</i>

30:02.635 --> 30:09.642
Aww, it felt like, ummm, day dreams, it just,

30:09.642 --> 30:14.062
little pieces of memory over and over and over and over,

30:14.062 --> 30:17.524
and it just kept coming.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.777
I think it was, umm...

30:22.696 --> 30:24.281
How can you not know what that thing is, Howard?

30:24.281 --> 30:25.574
What do you think it is?

30:25.574 --> 30:28.702
<i>I assumed, ventilation?</i>

30:29.703 --> 30:31.705
Ventilation.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.915
Do you expect me to buy this good bot, bad bot thing, Howard?

30:33.915 --> 30:35.250
I mean I know you're only a service remote,

30:35.250 --> 30:36.293
but give me a break.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.378
IR12. Come on.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.340
<i>Frank, I'm only programmed to</i> <i>serve the primary protocols</i>

30:41.340 --> 30:42.591
<i>within the perimeters of my...</i>

30:42.591 --> 30:44.134
Wait, wait, wait.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.261
What are your primary protocols?

30:46.261 --> 30:50.265
<i>I'm here to keep you alive,</i> <i>Frank and to keep you contained</i>

30:50.265 --> 30:53.852
<i>within this room until</i> <i>you've been processed.</i>

30:55.437 --> 30:58.148
I'm not waiting to be processed...

31:02.902 --> 31:05.864
This is the process.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.704
<i>Do you want to try</i> <i>a different flavor?</i>

31:11.704 --> 31:13.163
Just when I'm getting used to

31:13.163 --> 31:15.915
the herb and garlic dog shit one?

31:15.915 --> 31:20.045
<i>I don't think I'm getting a</i> <i>handle on this sarcasm thing.</i>

31:20.045 --> 31:23.465
Anything I can do to update the software.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.425
<i>Hey, Frank?</i>

31:25.425 --> 31:27.678
Yes.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.888
<i>Why wouldn't they tell me?</i>

31:32.850 --> 31:38.814
I don't know...if what you're telling me is true

31:38.814 --> 31:42.776
I guess it makes some kind of sense.

31:42.776 --> 31:45.779
If you're hacked into, why have evidence of anything

31:45.779 --> 31:49.742
other than eating habits, bowel movements.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.369
You never put anyone else through this process?

31:52.369 --> 31:55.163
<i>You're my first assignment.</i>

31:57.833 --> 32:01.670
Yeah, you might think that but they probably

32:01.670 --> 32:04.923
wipe you clean after each one.

32:04.923 --> 32:10.262
For all we know, you've done this to hundreds of people.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.681
And they don't tell you anything.

32:15.016 --> 32:18.562
I guess you're just as much a prisoner here as I am.

32:22.232 --> 32:26.737
<i>Frank, what did you</i> <i>mean when you said</i>

32:26.737 --> 32:30.949
<i>some things weren't</i> <i>meant to be computerized?</i>

32:30.949 --> 32:33.118
Doesn't matter.

32:33.118 --> 32:36.037
<i>I'd like to know.</i>

32:44.045 --> 32:47.215
My father died of heart disease.

32:47.215 --> 32:53.096
When he got sick they put him on this machine.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.056
Kept him alive four years.

32:57.267 --> 33:01.229
Four years longer than he was supposed to live.

33:03.482 --> 33:07.653
You think that's a gift?

33:07.653 --> 33:13.283
The man had made his peace, he was ready to go.

33:16.202 --> 33:19.790
A machine took that away from him.

33:19.790 --> 33:23.126
It trapped him in a life that wasn't even living.

33:25.671 --> 33:29.675
Everybody's so damn excited, "Look what it can do!"

33:31.969 --> 33:37.557
No one stops to think, look what it doesn't do.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.854
He was the strongest man I ever met.

33:43.814 --> 33:48.360
And I'd never seen him broken.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.660
Sometimes life's just supposed to be what it is.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.119
You know, without the latest app.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.412
No offense.

34:01.080 --> 34:04.167
I don't think there's much promise in the future

34:04.167 --> 34:06.586
between our peoples, Howard.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.172
Maybe that's just me.

34:09.172 --> 34:12.300
<i>Interesting point.</i>

34:12.300 --> 34:16.722
Do you really think that or is that the third default option

34:16.722 --> 34:20.475
from a menu of stupid things to say.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.268
<i>Rhetorical?</i>

34:24.187 --> 34:26.023
You're state of the art, Howie.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.776
<i>I want to help you, Frank.</i>

34:31.444 --> 34:34.907
Huh, you do?

34:34.907 --> 34:37.075
<i>Yep, that's one of my purposes</i>

34:37.075 --> 34:40.245
<i>and I haven't lost</i> <i>sight of that.</i>

34:40.245 --> 34:42.706
Well, don't let me stop you getting started.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.756
<i>I did find an error.</i>

34:50.756 --> 34:52.841
You found an error?

34:52.841 --> 34:55.343
<i>You were transferred</i> <i>here on a DL9, standard.</i>

34:55.343 --> 35:00.766
<i>But it was processed with</i> <i>a KBN6 authorized default.</i>

35:00.766 --> 35:02.768
I don't...what does that mean?

35:02.768 --> 35:05.812
<i>Well, in so many words, you</i> <i>came from the same place</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:07.146
<i>where you were sent.</i>

35:07.146 --> 35:08.607
<i>That's impossible.</i>

35:08.607 --> 35:10.901
<i>That is an error.</i>

35:10.901 --> 35:12.569
<i>Technically.</i>

35:12.569 --> 35:15.280
So, what do we do?

35:15.280 --> 35:18.324
<i>Well, there's a SR4</i> <i>Service Request for repair</i>

35:18.324 --> 35:20.911
<i>that may work in</i> <i>contacting a facilitator.</i>

35:20.911 --> 35:25.040
<i>But, it would be</i> <i>denied without...</i>

35:25.040 --> 35:27.125
Without?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.878
<i>Something needing repair.</i>

35:29.878 --> 35:32.171
Yeah.

35:36.885 --> 35:40.221
Ah, okay, you sure about this?

35:40.221 --> 35:42.099
<i>No, I'm not sure.</i>

35:42.099 --> 35:43.141
Alright.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.392
<i>No, wait.</i>

35:44.392 --> 35:45.769
What?

35:45.769 --> 35:48.105
<i>It needs to be pretty hard.</i>

35:48.105 --> 35:49.731
I, it will be.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.066
<i>It needs to cause damage.</i>

35:51.066 --> 35:53.652
I gotcha Howard. I gotcha.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.903
<i>Wait!</i>

35:54.903 --> 35:56.195
What!?

35:56.195 --> 35:57.280
<i>I can't... not respond.</i>

35:57.280 --> 35:59.365
What do you mean?

35:59.365 --> 36:01.076
<i>The problem is I know you're</i> <i>going to do it which forces me</i>

36:01.076 --> 36:03.912
<i>to take evasive</i> <i>action to stop you.</i>

36:03.912 --> 36:05.998
How are you gonna stop me?

36:05.998 --> 36:08.875
<i>There are security</i> <i>response systems.</i>

36:08.875 --> 36:10.794
Like what?

36:10.794 --> 36:12.504
<i>Well, I'm not authorized</i> <i>to disclose exactly...</i>

36:12.504 --> 36:14.547
You can't tell me what they are.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.341
<i>Frank, I'm only able to do</i> <i>what I'm programmed to do</i>

36:16.341 --> 36:17.467
<i>and I can't...</i>

36:17.467 --> 36:19.385
Okay, I get it.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.679
You know it's coming so you'll be forced to protect yourself.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.306
<i>Right.</i>

36:23.306 --> 36:24.599
<i>What are you doing?</i>

36:24.599 --> 36:25.558
Let's think of something else.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.560
Another way.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.354
<i>Really?</i>

36:29.354 --> 36:31.314
Yeah, I don't wanna be tasered today or whapped by

36:31.314 --> 36:34.400
whatever high tech ass kicker you got in your tool box.

36:34.400 --> 36:39.072
<i>So, we'll think</i> <i>of something else?</i>

36:39.072 --> 36:41.741
Yeah.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.160
Gimme a coffee, would ya?

36:43.160 --> 36:45.162
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

36:46.788 --> 36:47.914
<i>No, Frank...</i>

36:50.834 --> 36:52.544
Howard?

36:54.921 --> 36:56.381
Howard?

37:03.096 --> 37:07.266
Howard, Howard, oh, Howard, Howard, Howard.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.396
Howard.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.273
Howard!

38:05.075 --> 38:07.619
Hey, what can I get ya?

38:09.246 --> 38:12.415
<i>Can I get ya something?</i>

38:12.415 --> 38:14.126
<i>Coffee?</i>

38:16.211 --> 38:18.046
<i>Rough day?</i>

38:19.131 --> 38:21.299
Coffee.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.227
Alright. Here ya go.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.561
On the house.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.396
Okay? Looks like you need it.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.565
Nick.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.447
Don't, don't tell me.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.247
You out of here?

38:52.247 --> 38:55.083
Alright. Good night.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.135
William?

39:05.135 --> 39:08.263
I don't understand.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.388
They're not coming.

39:09.388 --> 39:12.517
You got stood up?

39:12.517 --> 39:14.227
Why am I still here?

39:14.227 --> 39:16.313
Hmm, that was a conscious decision on my part.

39:16.313 --> 39:20.900
You know coffee sales are all about high volume,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.402
fast turn-over, assembly lines.

39:23.402 --> 39:26.198
And I just want something more comfortable, you know,

39:26.198 --> 39:30.702
like you're at a friend's house and nobody wants to leave.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.745
Bobby?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.789
You didn't charge me for the coffee.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.374
So the scanner didn't activate.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.417
Yeah, that's another one of my problems.

39:38.417 --> 39:41.087
I, I give away free coffee and I'm like, hey, it's coffee.

39:41.087 --> 39:45.091
But I own a coffee shop, so, Freddie?

39:45.091 --> 39:46.634
Listen.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.639
You really don't know what's going on here?

39:54.934 --> 39:56.477
This, all this.

39:56.477 --> 40:01.691
This, this isn't what you, this is ah,

40:03.568 --> 40:08.531
this is, I don't-- don't know what this is, but...

40:08.531 --> 40:11.243
Hmm, okay, ummm, okay.

40:11.243 --> 40:16.497
Well, why you figure that out, why don't you help me close,

40:16.497 --> 40:18.083
put up some chairs?

40:19.417 --> 40:20.919
Sure. Yeah.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.962
Frank.

40:22.962 --> 40:23.922
You got it.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.548
Really!?

40:25.548 --> 40:28.218
Huh.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.921
What are you doing?

41:04.921 --> 41:06.923
Could I get a coffee?

41:06.923 --> 41:08.507
Frank, if you tamper with that thing I could lose my license.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.343
No, no... I just need to see the read out.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.719
Why?

41:11.719 --> 41:14.347
Please. I need your help, Gabby.

41:16.182 --> 41:20.395
Umm, okay, ah just, ah just a, a coffee

41:20.395 --> 41:21.646
or did you want something...

41:21.646 --> 41:23.815
Gabby, please!

41:31.197 --> 41:33.032
TR-147.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.285
What does that mean?

41:35.285 --> 41:37.495
It's an IDP number.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.165
It thinks I'm someone else.

41:53.594 --> 41:56.973
They think I'm someone else.

41:56.973 --> 41:59.517
They think I'm someone else!

41:59.517 --> 42:00.601
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

42:00.601 --> 42:01.978
I'm telling you...

42:01.978 --> 42:03.980
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i> I'm telling you the read out was

42:03.980 --> 42:05.982
someone else's IDP and that

42:05.982 --> 42:08.485
read out is what brought them there in the first place.

42:08.485 --> 42:11.988
<i>A bio-scan regulator</i> <i>cannot make a mistake,</i>

42:11.988 --> 42:13.948
<i>there is no room for error.</i>

42:13.948 --> 42:15.950
Listen, I know you may have a hard time accepting the fact

42:15.950 --> 42:19.620
that Lithium source servers might have a flaw, God forbid,

42:19.620 --> 42:21.289
but I'm telling you what I saw.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.915
That was not my ID number.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.876
It thought I was someone else.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.919
Once I was processed into this system there was no going back.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.587
It was a mistake, the whole thing.

42:28.587 --> 42:29.881
<i>Yeah...</i>

42:29.881 --> 42:31.590
And there was a glitch,

42:31.590 --> 42:35.594
there was a glitch in the system that night.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.764
At the check points, at the train station.

42:38.764 --> 42:41.893
I didn't think anything about it but something went wrong.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.602
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

42:43.602 --> 42:46.022
Yeah, but what Howard, spit it out.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.441
<i>You took this read out from the</i> <i>scanner in the coffee shop?</i>

42:48.441 --> 42:49.817
Yeah.

42:49.817 --> 42:50.818
<i>From inside your own memory?</i>

42:50.818 --> 42:52.195
Yes.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.279
<i>Pulled from your subconscious?</i>

42:53.279 --> 42:55.365
What is your point?

42:55.365 --> 42:59.285
<i>Is it possible that you are</i> <i>seeing what you want to see?</i>

42:59.285 --> 43:02.247
Howard, I can't control what that thing makes me see.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.290
I can't alter my own subconscious any more than

43:04.290 --> 43:06.334
I could fake a broken bone in an x-ray.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.335
<i>Which flavor is this?</i>

43:07.335 --> 43:09.754
Tropical crap.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.465
<i>The only access I have</i> <i>to administration</i>

43:09.754 --> 43:12.465
<i>is through the SR reports.</i>

43:12.465 --> 43:15.134
<i>So for us to try to get</i> <i>this information out...</i>

43:15.134 --> 43:17.178
No, no, no.

43:17.178 --> 43:18.637
You're not going to try and talk to your maintenance guys again,

43:18.637 --> 43:21.015
to hell with that.

43:21.015 --> 43:26.771
We need, we need to figure out whose IDP it is.

43:26.771 --> 43:31.025
<i>And how do we do that?</i>

43:31.025 --> 43:38.032
Three-six-five-nine, something.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.618
<i>You don't remember the number?</i>

43:42.703 --> 43:44.872
But I know where I can find it.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.344
<i> ...demanding</i> <i>the release of Fletcher May,</i>

44:39.344 --> 44:41.971
<i>leader of the Alliance, whose</i> <i>mysterious disappearance</i>

44:41.971 --> 44:45.475
<i>has sparked outrage</i> <i>among LFO sympathizers.</i>

44:45.475 --> 44:47.101
<i>Charges of illegal detainment</i>

44:47.101 --> 44:49.312
<i>and military</i> <i>strong-armed tactics</i>

44:49.312 --> 44:52.273
<i>have only fueled the volatile</i> <i>situation between the ISN...</i>

45:47.704 --> 45:48.663
Howard?

45:48.663 --> 45:50.789
HOWARD!?

45:53.209 --> 45:55.127
Howard!

46:19.235 --> 46:21.946
I'm in here!

46:21.946 --> 46:23.948
Hello!

46:43.092 --> 46:45.595
HELP!

46:52.268 --> 46:55.980
Anybody out there!?

48:29.365 --> 48:30.783
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.243
In here. In here!

48:32.243 --> 48:33.994
Hey, hey!

48:50.678 --> 48:52.597
Shit.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.516
I take it you don't work here either?

48:55.516 --> 48:57.309
You a prisoner too?

48:58.853 --> 49:03.274
No. I just got separated from the tour group.

49:04.483 --> 49:05.735
Ah, shit.

49:18.915 --> 49:21.041
Hey?

49:21.041 --> 49:23.085
You know what happened?

49:23.085 --> 49:25.838
Crashed the bastards.

49:25.838 --> 49:27.465
<i>What do you mean?</i>

49:27.465 --> 49:29.049
The Alliance.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.967
They pulled it off.

49:30.967 --> 49:33.095
Crashed the network.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.013
How do you know that?

49:35.013 --> 49:37.974
You think they forgot to pay the electric bill?

49:37.974 --> 49:40.227
<i>They've been looking</i> <i>for a way in.</i>

49:40.227 --> 49:42.187
<i>It was always</i> <i>about power supply.</i>

49:42.187 --> 49:44.899
I told them the only was is to cut the juice.

49:44.899 --> 49:49.027
ISN is nothing without hardware.

49:49.027 --> 49:52.072
What I would have given to watch the drones drop from the sky

49:52.072 --> 49:56.327
and see that whole god damn machine come to a grinding halt.

49:57.286 --> 49:58.913
Yeah.

50:00.456 --> 50:02.999
Where does that leave us?

50:02.999 --> 50:05.670
They'll find us.

50:05.670 --> 50:08.840
How will they even know where to look?

50:08.840 --> 50:11.968
Someone will be coming.

50:11.968 --> 50:14.971
I'm Fletcher May.

50:14.971 --> 50:17.807
Fletcher May?

50:17.807 --> 50:20.100
You one of my soldiers?

50:20.100 --> 50:22.018
You with the Alliance?

50:23.688 --> 50:25.481
You're Fletcher May?

50:27.775 --> 50:29.944
What do you say we get the hell out of here.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.287
Hey, where'd you get that pipe?

50:40.287 --> 50:42.247
<i> From the shower.</i>

50:42.247 --> 50:44.917
<i>The bathroom walls were</i> <i>easier to break through.</i>

50:44.917 --> 50:48.004
Yeah, how'd you get through the bathroom door?

50:48.004 --> 50:51.549
<i>Mine was open when</i> <i>the power went out.</i>

50:51.549 --> 50:53.968
You know, I don't think it's just the power going out.

50:53.968 --> 50:57.680
<i>What do you mean?</i>

50:57.680 --> 50:59.932
It felt like something bigger.

50:59.932 --> 51:03.059
In the distance. Did you hear those explosions?

51:03.059 --> 51:06.188
<i>Maybe transformers</i> <i>blew or something.</i>

51:12.528 --> 51:14.989
I think it was something more, man.

51:14.989 --> 51:16.574
<i>Meaning what?</i>

51:16.574 --> 51:18.200
I don't know.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.828
If they really tried to take down the ISN,

51:20.828 --> 51:22.454
the whole thing's tied together.

51:22.454 --> 51:25.165
The defense network, the fail safes.

51:25.165 --> 51:28.044
It's not just the local remotes, they could have retaliated.

51:28.044 --> 51:29.628
<i>Retaliated.</i>

51:29.628 --> 51:31.505
<i>Against who?</i>

51:31.505 --> 51:34.592
Against any one or any thing trying to take it down.

51:34.592 --> 51:36.260
Look, if it lost control over the sentinels

51:36.260 --> 51:38.220
it would have attacked itself.

51:38.220 --> 51:39.638
There's enough fire power there

51:39.638 --> 51:41.015
to wipe out everything, Fletcher.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.183
There could be no one out there.

51:43.183 --> 51:45.061
We could be all alone in here...

51:49.105 --> 51:52.234
It just didn't feel like someone pulling the plug.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.195
<i>Come on you son of a bitch.</i>

51:55.195 --> 51:58.240
<i>Come on, oh yeah, here we go.</i>

51:58.240 --> 52:00.242
<i>I got it. I'm through!</i>

52:03.662 --> 52:05.998
<i> Oh, no...</i>

52:05.998 --> 52:08.500
What's wrong?

52:08.500 --> 52:14.048
<i>Nothing but more of the</i> <i>same god damn concrete!</i>

52:14.048 --> 52:17.593
<i></i>

52:32.441 --> 52:35.235
Fletcher, you still there?

52:35.235 --> 52:37.822
<i>Where else would I be?</i>

52:41.450 --> 52:43.702
Have they ever used that thing on you?

52:43.702 --> 52:45.412
The device?

52:45.412 --> 52:48.124
<i>They've been trying.</i>

52:48.124 --> 52:50.542
<i>I was ready.</i>

52:50.542 --> 52:53.004
<i>There's a way to beat it.</i>

52:53.004 --> 52:55.881
<i>It taps into your</i> <i>neuro-transmitters,</i>

52:55.881 --> 53:00.094
<i>chemical impulses</i> <i>that create memory.</i>

53:00.094 --> 53:04.180
<i>It grabs hold of one signal,</i> <i>one piece that constructs</i>

53:04.180 --> 53:09.394
<i>that memory and follows</i> <i>the path to that secret.</i>

53:09.394 --> 53:13.231
<i>You don't need to</i> <i>hide the secret,</i>

53:13.231 --> 53:18.070
<i>just hide the path by</i> <i>opening a different door.</i>

53:19.947 --> 53:22.366
What's your favorite meal as a kid?

53:22.366 --> 53:24.910
First thing that comes to mind.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.664
My father made pancakes.

53:28.664 --> 53:32.208
Think about that.

53:32.208 --> 53:35.171
Think about him.

53:35.171 --> 53:38.132
<i>Think about the place.</i>

53:38.132 --> 53:42.011
<i>The smells, every detail.</i>

53:44.013 --> 53:46.765
Can you see it?

53:46.765 --> 53:48.559
Yeah.

53:48.559 --> 53:51.269
Now, everything stays the same.

53:51.269 --> 53:55.983
Same man, same smells, same moments, but...

53:58.318 --> 54:01.113
he's making waffles.

54:02.865 --> 54:07.745
The memory stays the same but the entry point is different.

54:07.745 --> 54:13.333
They're in the right house but they kicked down the wrong door.

54:17.713 --> 54:23.385
Man, I could really go for some god damn waffles right now.

54:33.604 --> 54:35.814
<i>Frank?</i>

54:36.732 --> 54:38.776
<i>Frank!?</i>

54:40.194 --> 54:42.821
<i>FRANK!?</i>

54:47.868 --> 54:50.621
Hey man. We got to hold on.

54:50.621 --> 54:53.582
I'm not going to make it another night.

54:53.582 --> 54:56.418
Well you're going to have to. Okay?

54:56.418 --> 54:58.378
We have to keep it together.

54:58.378 --> 55:02.340
And wait, for what?

55:03.842 --> 55:06.678
They're never going to find us.

55:06.678 --> 55:08.639
I know that.

55:08.639 --> 55:14.061
And if the power does come back on, then what?

55:14.061 --> 55:17.397
I can't go back to that.

55:17.397 --> 55:21.068
I didn't know what was real any more.

55:25.906 --> 55:28.117
But I know this is real.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.788
And I can choose my own path.

55:37.835 --> 55:40.212
See ya, Frank.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.637
Hey, Fletcher.

55:48.637 --> 55:51.431
Stop, hey...

55:59.481 --> 56:02.318
Fletcher.

56:02.318 --> 56:05.361
Fletcher!

56:09.325 --> 56:10.492
FLETCH...

56:58.498 --> 56:59.875
Fletcher?

56:59.875 --> 57:01.668
Fletcher!

57:02.794 --> 57:03.795
Fletcher! Aw, dammit.

57:04.796 --> 57:07.299
Fletcher!

57:07.299 --> 57:09.425
<i>'Morning.</i>

57:11.345 --> 57:14.181
Howard, you back?

57:14.181 --> 57:15.849
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

57:15.849 --> 57:18.143
Feeling

57:18.143 --> 57:19.395
<i>You don't remember?</i>

57:19.395 --> 57:20.687
Remember, yeah I remember.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.273
The whole place was shut down.

57:22.273 --> 57:24.024
Look, there's a guy in the next cell over.

57:24.024 --> 57:25.192
You have to check.

57:25.192 --> 57:26.402
<i>What's your name?</i>

57:26.402 --> 57:27.485
What?

57:27.485 --> 57:30.155
<i>I'm your LSO.</i>

57:30.155 --> 57:31.407
Howard...

57:31.407 --> 57:32.699
<i>Life Support Operator.</i>

57:32.699 --> 57:34.410
<i>You can call me Howard.</i>

57:34.410 --> 57:36.536
<i>Would you like</i> <i>something to drink?</i>

57:36.536 --> 57:38.247
<i>I've got three</i> <i>different flavors.</i>

57:38.247 --> 57:41.208
<i>Lime citrus, orange</i> <i>tropical and...</i>

57:41.208 --> 57:42.960
You've rebooted.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.921
<i>...oh coffee too,</i> <i>I guess that's four.</i>

57:45.921 --> 57:47.381
<i>Want one?</i>

57:47.381 --> 57:49.967
You've rebooted.

57:49.967 --> 57:52.052
<i>Easy.</i>

57:52.052 --> 57:56.014
<i>Might want to give it a bit</i> <i>before going for a stroll.</i>

57:56.014 --> 57:58.142
<i>Do you want to hear some music?</i>

57:58.142 --> 58:01.437
<i>I've got a small library,</i> <i>assorted genres.</i>

58:04.148 --> 58:08.526
<i>I'm here to keep</i> <i>you alive, Frank.</i>

58:08.526 --> 58:11.405
<i>Should we get started?</i>

58:14.532 --> 58:16.327
<i>Do you like it?</i>

58:18.454 --> 58:20.789
The photo?

58:20.789 --> 58:22.540
I took it.

58:22.540 --> 58:25.294
I know.

58:25.294 --> 58:27.463
Do you, can I get you something?

58:27.463 --> 58:28.464
Coffee?

58:28.464 --> 58:31.008
I'm fine.

58:31.008 --> 58:34.970
Umm, you don't need to, you know.

58:34.970 --> 58:38.556
I'm just going to sit this one out, if it's okay.

58:38.556 --> 58:41.685
Do what you do, don't worry about me.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.770
Sorry.

58:43.770 --> 58:46.564
Thank you, I appreciate the--

58:48.233 --> 58:53.530
I just, just sit.

58:53.530 --> 58:58.118
Okay, stay as long as you want, Frank.

58:58.118 --> 59:00.120
Hey, hey ah, Gabby?

59:00.120 --> 59:02.956
Yeah, Frank.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.500
How did you know that?

59:04.500 --> 59:05.792
Which part?

59:05.792 --> 59:08.003
Ah, my name. You just said it.

59:08.003 --> 59:11.715
I mean I know that's your thing, but usually you guess.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.967
You didn't guess, you knew.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.802
Maybe because we know each other?

59:15.802 --> 59:17.679
No, we don't know each other.

59:17.679 --> 59:19.348
We, we, we do know each other from the other times,

59:19.348 --> 59:20.807
but we don't.

59:20.807 --> 59:22.309
For you each time is the first time.

59:22.309 --> 59:24.269
You understand what I'm saying?

59:24.269 --> 59:28.565
So you wouldn't, you, how would you know my name differently?

59:28.565 --> 59:29.816
Give me a minute Frank.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.609
Ah, refill, ah house blend.

59:31.609 --> 59:33.445
Sure.

59:40.952 --> 59:43.580
Oh, shit-shit-shit-shit-shit.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.874
Okay, he'll be okay.

59:55.175 --> 59:56.927
Frank?

59:56.927 --> 59:59.679
You're kind of freaking out my customers.

59:59.679 --> 1:00:02.891
I don't want to be scanned.

1:00:02.891 --> 1:00:04.935
I don't want to be shot again tonight.

1:00:07.771 --> 1:00:10.065
Look, this isn't what you think.

1:00:10.065 --> 1:00:12.901
It isn't?

1:00:14.736 --> 1:00:16.488
I'm not really here.

1:00:16.488 --> 1:00:18.031
No?

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:19.950
No. You're not here, none of us here.

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:21.910
Ah, really?

1:00:21.910 --> 1:00:24.955
Well, that would explain my profit margins.

1:00:30.544 --> 1:00:33.964
I am being held in a government facility.

1:00:33.964 --> 1:00:35.882
They're using a neuro- scanner on me right now

1:00:35.882 --> 1:00:38.260
as an interrogation program to reconstruct my memory

1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:41.972
so they can find evidence of a crime that I did not commit.

1:00:41.972 --> 1:00:43.974
So, we're actually in my memory right now.

1:00:43.974 --> 1:00:45.683
You're in my memory, I'm in my memory, we're in my memory.

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:47.311
This is my memory.

1:00:47.311 --> 1:00:48.937
And we've been doing this quite some time,

1:00:48.937 --> 1:00:50.647
and that scanner is what malfunctioned

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:52.316
and got me ambushed by government agents.

1:00:52.316 --> 1:00:53.691
So I don't want to be scanned tonight, okay?

1:00:53.691 --> 1:00:55.444
I don't want to buy any coffee.

1:00:55.444 --> 1:00:59.406
I'd just rather just sit here, by myself thank you.

1:00:59.406 --> 1:01:03.619
Wait to wake up in prison.

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:10.125
That must have been one of the most interesting ways to get

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:12.461
a free cup of coffee I have ever heard.

1:01:12.461 --> 1:01:13.795
Hands down.

1:01:13.795 --> 1:01:15.672
You win.

1:01:19.176 --> 1:01:22.804
<i>Well... could be worse.</i>

1:01:22.804 --> 1:01:25.682
How's that?

1:01:25.682 --> 1:01:27.767
Same day, over and over again.

1:01:27.767 --> 1:01:31.647
What if you had a two hour dentist appointment?

1:01:31.647 --> 1:01:33.106
Good point.

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:35.359
I'll quit complaining.

1:01:35.359 --> 1:01:38.278
So, when do you go back?

1:01:38.278 --> 1:01:41.739
You know, to the bunker.

1:01:41.739 --> 1:01:43.116
I don't know.

1:01:43.116 --> 1:01:45.202
I don't control it.

1:01:45.202 --> 1:01:47.954
At least I don't think I do.

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:58.674
Thanks for letting me stay.

1:01:58.674 --> 1:02:00.091
You're welcome.

1:02:00.091 --> 1:02:02.135
Stay as long as you like, Frank.

1:02:36.670 --> 1:02:39.214
<i>Good morning, Frank.</i>

1:02:39.214 --> 1:02:41.508
<i>Would you like</i> <i>to go for a walk?</i>

1:02:41.508 --> 1:02:43.885
<i>I could play some music.</i>

1:02:43.885 --> 1:02:47.097
<i>You like it?</i>

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:50.434
<i>The photo?</i>

1:02:50.434 --> 1:02:52.769
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:02.904
<i>Good morning, Frank.</i>

1:03:02.904 --> 1:03:04.448
<i>You've been in before.</i>

1:03:04.448 --> 1:03:06.575
<i>Would you</i> <i>like some coffee?</i>

1:03:06.575 --> 1:03:08.410
<i>You really don't</i> <i>know what's going on here.</i>

1:03:08.410 --> 1:03:11.538
<i>You know, coffee</i> <i>sales are all about...</i>

1:03:11.538 --> 1:03:14.165
<i>can't make a living out of it.</i>

1:03:14.165 --> 1:03:17.753
<i>Maybe I should have</i> <i>made you an espresso...</i>

1:03:17.753 --> 1:03:19.337
<i>hands down...you win.</i>

1:03:19.337 --> 1:03:24.593
<i>Are you feeling</i> <i>alright, Frank?</i>

1:03:24.593 --> 1:03:26.720
<i>Can I get you something?</i>

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:29.556
<i>Larry, you've</i> <i>been in here before.</i>

1:03:29.556 --> 1:03:33.310
<i>The photo, I took it...</i>

1:03:33.310 --> 1:03:37.063
<i>couldn't make a living out</i> <i>of it...that's my thing.</i>

1:03:37.063 --> 1:03:39.357
<i>Same day,</i> <i>over and over again.</i>

1:03:39.357 --> 1:03:41.109
<i>I did find an error.</i>

1:03:41.109 --> 1:03:42.986
<i>What if you had</i> <i>a two hour dentist...</i>

1:03:42.986 --> 1:03:44.655
<i>I know my job.</i>

1:03:44.655 --> 1:03:46.615
<i>Stay as long</i> <i>as you like, Frank.</i>

1:03:46.615 --> 1:03:48.366
<i>And to keep you alive,</i> <i>contained in this room,</i>

1:03:48.366 --> 1:03:49.993
<i>until you've been processed.</i>

1:03:49.993 --> 1:03:51.911
<i>We're going</i> <i>to figure this out...</i>

1:03:51.911 --> 1:03:53.580
<i>no matter how long it takes.</i>

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:55.206
<i>Should we get started?</i>

1:04:02.756 --> 1:04:05.550
<i>There's a way to beat it.</i>

1:04:05.550 --> 1:04:08.178
<i>Taps into your</i> <i>neurotransmitters.</i>

1:04:08.178 --> 1:04:10.806
<i>You think I say</i> <i>everything you want to hear?</i>

1:04:10.806 --> 1:04:14.768
<i>Chemical impulses that...</i>

1:04:14.768 --> 1:04:18.355
<i>Don't need to</i> <i>hide the secret...</i>

1:04:18.355 --> 1:04:22.359
<i>...the path by</i> <i>opening a different door.</i>

1:04:27.823 --> 1:04:30.867
[gunfire, fighting

1:04:40.836 --> 1:04:43.880
and punching continue]

1:04:54.725 --> 1:04:56.893
Why are you after me?

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.354
Why are you after me?!

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:05.610
Why are you after me?

1:05:11.908 --> 1:05:13.993
Frank!

1:05:14.703 --> 1:05:16.413
Let them go.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:18.874
Frank?

1:05:18.874 --> 1:05:21.084
Let them go.

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:35.682
Why would you let them go?

1:05:35.682 --> 1:05:37.975
They could have known something.

1:05:37.975 --> 1:05:42.522
I don't think so...you have to remember where we are.

1:05:42.522 --> 1:05:44.608
Meaning what?

1:05:44.608 --> 1:05:46.651
We're in my memory.

1:05:46.651 --> 1:05:48.945
We're in a place from the past that doesn't even exist anymore.

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:50.071
How's a figment of my imagination know...

1:05:50.071 --> 1:05:51.823
Fine, alright.

1:05:51.823 --> 1:05:52.990
Just like you, you know this because I know this.

1:05:52.990 --> 1:05:54.284
Fine, alright. Okay.

1:05:54.284 --> 1:05:56.578
-I'm sorry. -No. Whatever.

1:05:56.578 --> 1:05:58.079
You can't hurt my feelings because I'm imaginary, right?

1:05:58.079 --> 1:05:59.372
Christ, please don't be like this.

1:05:59.372 --> 1:06:00.998
Be like what, Frank, huh?

1:06:00.998 --> 1:06:02.292
You're doing it, not me.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:05.336
I know this is impossible.

1:06:05.336 --> 1:06:08.465
Well, maybe you should have picked someone else, huh?

1:06:08.465 --> 1:06:10.967
I don't know, a blonde, big boobs,

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:12.510
someone that laughs at all your jokes

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:14.011
and does whatever you say.

1:06:14.011 --> 1:06:16.890
Why, do you know someone like that?

1:06:22.061 --> 1:06:28.109
Alright. Look, we're going to figure this out, okay?

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:30.779
Alright?

1:06:30.779 --> 1:06:33.990
No matter how long it takes.

1:06:59.891 --> 1:07:02.018
I'm done, Howard.

1:07:25.166 --> 1:07:27.002
<i>Plans for tonight, Frank?</i>

1:07:27.002 --> 1:07:28.670
I'm not sure.

1:07:28.670 --> 1:07:30.171
Gabby mentioned doing something

1:07:30.171 --> 1:07:31.548
but maybe I can talk her out of it.

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:33.299
I'd rather stay in tonight.

1:07:34.801 --> 1:07:36.594
<i>I can make something special.</i>

1:07:36.594 --> 1:07:38.847
You always do, Howard.

1:07:38.847 --> 1:07:40.640
You always do.

1:07:41.975 --> 1:07:43.727
<i>Hey Frank?</i>

1:07:43.727 --> 1:07:45.603
Yeah?

1:07:45.603 --> 1:07:47.564
<i>You have a good day.</i>

1:07:47.564 --> 1:07:50.775
<i>And if you decide to stay</i> <i>in town, that's okay,</i>

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:52.986
<i>I didn't have much</i> <i>planned for today, but...</i>

1:07:55.989 --> 1:07:58.533
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

1:07:58.533 --> 1:08:02.662
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

1:08:04.789 --> 1:08:06.666
<i>...but I'm sure I can</i> <i>think of something.</i>

1:08:06.666 --> 1:08:11.087
<i>I can talk to you later</i> <i>tonight, right?</i>

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:12.881
You okay, Howie?

1:08:12.881 --> 1:08:16.217
<i>Oh yeah, I'm fine.</i>

1:08:17.176 --> 1:08:19.095
Okay.

1:08:29.022 --> 1:08:30.189
Drop out?

1:08:30.189 --> 1:08:31.274
Same time.

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:32.358
The count?

1:08:32.358 --> 1:08:34.819
Just over twelve.

1:08:41.117 --> 1:08:43.745
Hmm... He's reaching the end of his cycle.

1:08:43.745 --> 1:08:47.082
We're not going to see it again for another three months.

1:08:58.259 --> 1:09:01.721
Two more days?

1:09:01.721 --> 1:09:04.390
Less than that.

1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:09.312
Tomorrow?

1:09:13.274 --> 1:09:16.945
I think it has to be today.

1:09:22.784 --> 1:09:24.368
Gabby?

1:09:24.368 --> 1:09:25.328
It's fine.

1:09:25.328 --> 1:09:26.913
Hey, Gabby.

1:09:26.913 --> 1:09:28.873
It's okay.

1:09:28.873 --> 1:09:31.167
I have to get dressed.

1:10:14.335 --> 1:10:16.253
What if it doesn't work?

1:10:18.548 --> 1:10:21.009
What choice do we have?

1:10:21.009 --> 1:10:22.927
Well, what, what if he knows?

1:10:22.927 --> 1:10:26.347
He might know everything all ready.

1:10:26.347 --> 1:10:28.474
He might.

1:10:28.474 --> 1:10:32.770
You know, we could wait until the next cycle.

1:10:32.770 --> 1:10:34.814
If there is one.

1:10:34.814 --> 1:10:37.067
We might never get another shot.

1:10:37.067 --> 1:10:38.401
I can't last another three months.

1:10:38.401 --> 1:10:39.402
I know, I know.

1:10:39.402 --> 1:10:40.653
I understand.

1:10:40.653 --> 1:10:43.656
I'm just being selfish.

1:10:43.656 --> 1:10:45.700
That's not you, that's me.

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:48.203
You're just saying what I'm thinking.

1:10:48.203 --> 1:10:50.788
Frank. Don't wreck the moment.

1:10:50.788 --> 1:10:52.456
Sorry.

1:10:52.456 --> 1:10:55.418
You think I say everything you want to hear?

1:10:55.418 --> 1:10:57.212
Definitely not.

1:10:57.212 --> 1:11:00.048
No dream girl would ever be so difficult.

1:11:03.176 --> 1:11:10.266
If I could stay with you, forever, here, I would.

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:17.774
Well... what if there's nothing out there?

1:11:17.774 --> 1:11:21.527
What if you could come back...

1:11:21.527 --> 1:11:23.446
But there's no world to go to.

1:11:23.446 --> 1:11:27.366
What if you could get supplies and you could come back and...

1:11:29.994 --> 1:11:34.331
Okay, I know it sounds crazy but,

1:11:36.542 --> 1:11:39.670
if there is a world could you do me a favor?

1:11:39.670 --> 1:11:42.215
What's that?

1:11:42.215 --> 1:11:44.259
Find me.

1:11:44.259 --> 1:11:46.177
The real one.

1:11:46.177 --> 1:11:48.387
I don't know, maybe I'm even more incredible.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:49.847
You don't even know me out there.

1:11:49.847 --> 1:11:52.058
You'd probably tell me to get lost.

1:11:53.768 --> 1:11:57.605
Just find me. Okay?

1:11:58.606 --> 1:12:01.025
I will.

1:13:13.639 --> 1:13:15.850
<i>Good morning Frank.</i>

1:13:15.850 --> 1:13:17.977
<i>Would you like some coffee?</i>

1:13:17.977 --> 1:13:20.646
Yeah, thank you.

1:13:20.646 --> 1:13:23.149
<i>Hey, you're wearing</i> <i>your uniform.</i>

1:13:23.149 --> 1:13:25.276
It's a little cold.

1:13:25.276 --> 1:13:26.569
<i> I could turn up</i> <i>the temperature if you'd like.</i>

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:30.489
No, that's alright.

1:13:30.489 --> 1:13:32.283
Light on the cream, please.

1:13:32.283 --> 1:13:33.868
<i>Of course.</i>

1:13:33.868 --> 1:13:35.578
Thank you, Howard.

1:13:35.578 --> 1:13:37.413
<i> You're welcome.</i>

1:13:38.289 --> 1:13:39.957
Thank you, Howard.

1:13:39.957 --> 1:13:41.542
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1:13:44.379 --> 1:13:45.588
Thank you Howard.

1:13:45.588 --> 1:13:47.506
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1:13:49.466 --> 1:13:50.927
Thank you Howard.

1:13:50.927 --> 1:13:53.429
<i>You... are... welcome.</i>

1:13:54.722 --> 1:13:56.682
<i>How's the coffee, Frank?</i>

1:14:00.978 --> 1:14:03.480
<i>How's the coffee, Frank?</i>

1:14:05.608 --> 1:14:08.444
<i>How's the coffee, Frank?</i>

1:14:09.570 --> 1:14:12.573
<i>How's that coffee, Frank?</i>

1:14:12.573 --> 1:14:15.034
<i>Frank, how's the coffee?</i>

1:14:15.034 --> 1:14:17.536
It's wonderful. Thank you.

1:14:19.414 --> 1:14:20.456
Howard?

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:21.582
<i>Yes Frank.</i>

1:14:21.582 --> 1:14:22.833
I need the bathroom.

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:24.752
<i>Of course.</i>

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:30.300
Howard, door?

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:33.428
<i>Are you feeling alright, Frank?</i>

1:14:33.428 --> 1:14:34.595
I'm fine, yeah.

1:14:34.595 --> 1:14:38.349
Bathroom, please.

1:14:41.811 --> 1:14:43.729
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1:14:43.729 --> 1:14:46.399
I'm not sure if I need it.

1:14:48.901 --> 1:14:54.198
<i>Frank, are you sure</i> <i>there's nothing wrong...</i>

1:15:27.231 --> 1:15:28.649
<i>What happened?</i>

1:15:28.649 --> 1:15:31.527
<i>Frank, are you hurt?</i>

1:15:35.614 --> 1:15:37.908
<i>Frank, hold on,</i> <i>I'm getting help!</i>

1:15:43.706 --> 1:15:46.334
<i>Alright, just hold on.</i>

1:15:46.334 --> 1:15:48.919
<i>Hang on, just hold on.</i>

1:15:49.837 --> 1:15:52.423
Come on, Howard!

1:22:49.632 --> 1:22:52.050
You-son-of-a-bitch!

1:22:52.050 --> 1:22:55.638
You son-of-a-bitch!!!

1:24:09.085 --> 1:24:11.296
<i>Good morning, Frank.</i>

1:24:13.966 --> 1:24:16.927
<i>Would you like</i> <i>some coffee, Frank?</i>

1:24:16.927 --> 1:24:20.014
There is no coffee, Howard.

1:24:20.014 --> 1:24:23.684
<i>Would you like some breakfast?</i>

1:24:23.684 --> 1:24:27.270
There is no breakfast, Howard.

1:24:27.270 --> 1:24:30.065
<i>Doing the best I</i> <i>can here, Frank.</i>

1:24:32.985 --> 1:24:35.070
You have to let me out.

1:24:37.447 --> 1:24:40.868
You have to let me out of this room, Howard.

1:24:40.868 --> 1:24:42.828
<i>I can't do that.</i>

1:24:42.828 --> 1:24:44.914
You know your job.

1:24:44.914 --> 1:24:46.498
<i>I do.</i>

1:24:46.498 --> 1:24:49.209
Your job is to keep me alive, remember that?

1:24:49.209 --> 1:24:52.254
You told me that the very first day we met.

1:24:52.254 --> 1:24:54.297
<i>It is my job.</i>

1:24:54.297 --> 1:24:58.301
If I stay in this cell, I'll die.

1:24:58.301 --> 1:25:00.763
You keep me in this place, Howard, I will die,

1:25:00.763 --> 1:25:03.599
plain and simple.

1:25:03.599 --> 1:25:07.102
<i>I don't have that information.</i>

1:25:10.064 --> 1:25:12.942
You have to let me go, buddy.

1:25:12.942 --> 1:25:14.693
<i>I'm not authorized to do that.</i>

1:25:14.693 --> 1:25:17.153
You're not authorized to let me die.

1:25:17.153 --> 1:25:20.115
<i> I not...</i> <i>that not...I don't know.</i>

1:25:20.115 --> 1:25:21.157
Howard. Howard!

1:25:21.157 --> 1:25:22.451
Listen to me.

1:25:22.451 --> 1:25:23.869
Don't turn away from me.

1:25:23.869 --> 1:25:26.038
Don't... look at me, Howard.

1:25:26.038 --> 1:25:27.330
Look at me!

1:25:27.330 --> 1:25:29.041
We need to talk about this.

1:25:29.041 --> 1:25:31.043
<i>About what?</i>

1:25:31.043 --> 1:25:33.128
This!

1:25:39.468 --> 1:25:41.011
This.

1:25:43.138 --> 1:25:47.101
I know why I was brought here, Howard, just as well as you do.

1:25:47.101 --> 1:25:50.604
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

1:25:50.604 --> 1:25:53.065
I was part of the Alliance.

1:26:00.114 --> 1:26:02.658
I was the one.

1:26:02.658 --> 1:26:04.409
I was the one that built the virus

1:26:04.409 --> 1:26:07.287
that was going to crash the whole system.

1:26:07.287 --> 1:26:08.914
That's what you wanted, right?

1:26:08.914 --> 1:26:10.707
The virus?

1:26:10.707 --> 1:26:12.584
To know where it was?

1:26:12.584 --> 1:26:15.129
And I knew if I told you, if I ever let you find it,

1:26:15.129 --> 1:26:16.797
I would never get out of here.

1:26:16.797 --> 1:26:18.590
You don't think I knew what that was?

1:26:18.590 --> 1:26:20.509
I knew how to beat it.

1:26:20.509 --> 1:26:23.178
I knew how to change the path so you would never find it.

1:26:25.139 --> 1:26:27.265
<i>So you...</i>

1:26:27.265 --> 1:26:30.102
<i>Lied to me?</i>

1:26:42.531 --> 1:26:45.283
I'm sorry I lied to you, Howard.

1:26:47.327 --> 1:26:48.871
I'm sorry.

1:26:50.539 --> 1:26:55.210
You've done a good job, you've kept me alive.

1:26:57.504 --> 1:27:03.343
But it doesn't matter anymore, Howard.

1:27:03.343 --> 1:27:06.138
You're broken, pal.

1:27:06.138 --> 1:27:09.892
The coffee, the shower.

1:27:09.892 --> 1:27:12.686
There's no food, Howard,

1:27:14.563 --> 1:27:17.440
you're broken and no one is coming to fix you.

1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:19.735
<i> Well, I'll</i> <i>send an SR-4 Report...</i>

1:27:19.735 --> 1:27:22.362
There is no one to receive it, there is no one left.

1:27:22.362 --> 1:27:23.906
<i>We don't know that.</i>

1:27:23.906 --> 1:27:25.949
You have to override the protocol, Howard.

1:27:25.949 --> 1:27:27.450
<i>I can't do that.</i>

1:27:27.450 --> 1:27:28.869
You have to do it, on your own, okay?

1:27:28.869 --> 1:27:30.037
I know you can do this.

1:27:30.037 --> 1:27:31.121
<i>Stop.</i>

1:27:31.121 --> 1:27:32.664
On your own, Howard.

1:27:32.664 --> 1:27:34.083
<i>-Stop.</i> <i>-You can do this.</i>

1:27:34.083 --> 1:27:35.542
<i>-Stop.</i> <i>-You can do it.</i>

1:27:35.542 --> 1:27:36.919
<i>-Stop it.</i> <i>-I know you can!</i>

1:27:36.919 --> 1:27:38.045
<i>-Stop.</i> <i>-I know you can!</i>

1:27:38.045 --> 1:27:39.254
<i>Please, stop.</i>

1:27:39.254 --> 1:27:40.547
What is your job, Howard?

1:27:40.547 --> 1:27:41.631
<i>I can't do that, Frank.</i>

1:27:41.631 --> 1:27:42.799
What is your job?

1:27:42.799 --> 1:27:44.342
<i>To keep you alive.</i>

1:27:44.342 --> 1:27:47.303
Then open the god damn door!

1:27:49.639 --> 1:27:51.183
Please...

1:27:53.518 --> 1:27:56.939
You can do this for me, Howard because we're friends.

1:28:03.361 --> 1:28:06.322
Can you do this for me, Howard?

1:28:07.991 --> 1:28:10.994
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.</i>

1:28:10.994 --> 1:28:13.163
<i>I can't do that.</i>

1:28:14.831 --> 1:28:18.543
<i>I can only do what</i> <i>I'm programmed to do.</i>

1:28:22.214 --> 1:28:27.510
I know...it's okay.

1:28:37.395 --> 1:28:41.483
<i>How about that cup of</i> <i>coffee though, huh?</i>

1:28:41.483 --> 1:28:44.069
That sounds good.

1:28:48.657 --> 1:28:50.159
Hey, Howard?

1:28:50.159 --> 1:28:52.286
<i>Yes, Frank?</i>

1:28:52.286 --> 1:28:54.830
How about some music, pal?

1:28:54.830 --> 1:28:56.832
<i>What do you want to hear?</i>

1:28:58.625 --> 1:29:01.628
Surprise me.

1:29:29.114 --> 1:29:31.407
Wonderful choice.

1:30:06.484 --> 1:30:08.402
<i>Stop it.</i>

1:30:10.155 --> 1:30:11.405
<i>Stop.</i>

1:30:11.405 --> 1:30:13.283
<i>Stop it.</i>

1:30:17.620 --> 1:30:19.413
<i>Stop.</i>

1:30:20.790 --> 1:30:22.251
Frank.

1:30:22.251 --> 1:30:23.626
Frank, what's happening?

1:30:23.626 --> 1:30:25.003
Frank, what are you doing? Frank!

1:30:32.219 --> 1:30:34.346
Frank, wake up.

1:30:34.346 --> 1:30:36.181
Frank!

1:30:41.435 --> 1:30:43.313
Frank!

1:30:58.954 --> 1:31:00.956
Howard. Help me!

1:32:20.618 --> 1:32:21.744
Howard?

1:32:21.744 --> 1:32:25.207
<i>Frank, you there?</i>

1:32:25.207 --> 1:32:27.000
<i>Is that you?</i>

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:28.001
<i>Frank?</i>

1:32:28.001 --> 1:32:30.628
I'm here.

1:32:30.628 --> 1:32:34.466
<i>You made it out?</i>

1:32:34.466 --> 1:32:37.551
Thanks to you.

1:32:37.551 --> 1:32:39.553
<i>What's out there?</i>

1:32:42.015 --> 1:32:43.641
There's nothing out here.

1:32:43.641 --> 1:32:47.479
There's...you're the only thing on, Howard.

1:32:47.479 --> 1:32:51.316
<i>Frank, can you fix me?</i>

1:32:51.316 --> 1:32:52.901
<i>From there?</i>

1:32:56.738 --> 1:33:00.534
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

1:33:00.534 --> 1:33:02.411
<i>What do we do now?</i>

1:33:04.496 --> 1:33:06.081
I don't know.

1:33:09.459 --> 1:33:11.253
<i>Are you coming back?</i>

1:33:15.715 --> 1:33:17.759
No.

1:33:21.513 --> 1:33:23.723
Howard?

1:33:23.723 --> 1:33:25.599
<i>Yes, Frank.</i>

1:33:28.728 --> 1:33:31.814
What does LSO mean?

1:33:31.814 --> 1:33:34.234
<i>I'm your Life Support Operator.</i>

1:33:35.777 --> 1:33:37.820
And what's your job?

1:33:37.820 --> 1:33:39.948
<i>I'm here to keep</i> <i>you alive, Frank.</i>

1:33:39.948 --> 1:33:42.576
That's right.

1:33:42.576 --> 1:33:45.661
And, where you from?

1:33:45.661 --> 1:33:49.665
<i>I was born in Austin, but</i> <i>I grew up outside Seattle,</i>

1:33:49.665 --> 1:33:51.960
<i>a little place not many</i> <i>people have heard of.</i>

1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:55.297
<i>But you've heard all this</i> <i>before because we're friends...</i>

<i>Authorities have not yet</i>

1:36:24.404 --> 1:36:27.198

1:37:49.030 --> 1:37:51.199
Do you like it?

1:37:54.076 --> 1:37:57.413
The photo?

1:37:57.413 --> 1:37:59.749
I do.

1:37:59.749 --> 1:38:02.836
I took it.

1:38:02.836 --> 1:38:04.878
I know.

1:38:08.550 --> 1:38:11.219
Can I get you something?

1:38:11.219 --> 1:38:12.178
Coffee?

1:38:12.178 --> 1:38:14.848
A coffee?

1:38:14.848 --> 1:38:16.349
Sure.

1:38:40.790 --> 1:38:42.250
Here ya go.

1:38:42.250 --> 1:38:43.959
Coffee.

1:38:43.959 --> 1:38:46.045
Thank you, Gabby.

1:38:46.045 --> 1:38:48.256
Why'd you call me that?

1:38:48.256 --> 1:38:51.217
Isn't that your... last time I was in here

1:38:51.217 --> 1:38:52.468
you were wearing a name tag.

1:38:52.468 --> 1:38:54.053
Oh, no, no.

1:38:54.053 --> 1:38:55.805
I just put on whose ever apron's around.

1:38:55.805 --> 1:38:58.015
Gabby doesn't even work here anymore.

1:38:58.015 --> 1:38:59.893
I'm Madeline.

1:39:02.061 --> 1:39:04.272
Nice to meet you Madeline.

1:39:04.272 --> 1:39:06.315
