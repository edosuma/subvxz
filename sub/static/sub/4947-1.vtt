02:14.180 --> 02:15.295
How are things back there.

02:15.380 --> 02:18.700
Oh it's fine, slow.
I'm glad we're only a quarter-full.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.780
Yeah, same up here.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.660
Did you hear something
about the weather front?

02:21.660 --> 02:23.855
Yeah, these things used to bother me.

02:23.940 --> 02:24.929
The weather?

02:25.020 --> 02:29.059
No, that we're going
to be delayed getting into Paris.

02:30.620 --> 02:32.780
Please tell me you're panning
on getting some sleep tonight.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.896
I can promise you we'll be in bed early.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.130
Emily why don't you go out with us.
It will be so fun.

02:39.300 --> 02:40.255
Yeah, Paris at night.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.251
Ze Champs Elysee. Ze clubs.

02:42.340 --> 02:44.137
- Ze men with their...
- I will be busy.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.415
Now if you please excuse me ladies
I have some work to do.

02:48.740 --> 02:49.536
Yeah.

02:49.980 --> 02:50.969
That's a hint.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.370
Aye Aye.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.416
So what's the deal with the special cargo?

03:07.500 --> 03:12.096
It is some last minute top level
I government contractor shipment.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.179
It says there's an armed guard in the hull.

03:16.260 --> 03:17.409
That's a first.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.533
What are we carrying?

03:20.060 --> 03:21.288
I'm not sure I want to know.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.575
Well, looks like all
the signatures check out

03:23.660 --> 03:26.015
so we are free to take it from the S.O.C.

03:29.900 --> 03:35.418
It says here if there are any
abnormalities involving the cargo area.

03:36.220 --> 03:37.778
Abnormalities?

03:37.860 --> 03:42.809
We are to contact
a Dr. Bennett and Dr. Sebastian.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.297
These were the guys
that secured the cargo.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.938
They're in first class.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.460
Abnormalities?

03:48.460 --> 03:50.655
I'm glad this is my last flight.

03:50.740 --> 03:51.809
Yeah.

04:19.339 --> 04:20.819
Lucas, you need to settle down now.

04:20.899 --> 04:22.413
You're not listening.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.572
We could lose Kelly
and I'm not going to let that happen.

04:25.660 --> 04:26.820
Would you calm down.

04:26.820 --> 04:27.809
You're making a scene.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.379
Now I told you.

04:29.460 --> 04:30.859
I will bring Kelly out of stasis

04:30.940 --> 04:33.056
when we have a controlled environment.
Not before.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.529
We all know this is highly unorthodox.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.896
We had to move quickly.
This is her our, only way out.

04:38.980 --> 04:39.856
Unorthodox?

04:39.940 --> 04:42.249
Hey! She was dying and we saved her.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.609
If we hadn't intervened, she'd be dead.
You god damn well know that.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
Now, were we able to reach our friend?

04:50.500 --> 04:51.899
Kolinsky's made all the arrangements

04:51.980 --> 04:53.936
for the transport
and we'll see him in Prague.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.932
Prague?
I though we had a lab set up in Toulon.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.696
Christ, our files have been hacked.
That will be the first place they look.

04:59.780 --> 05:01.020
We are running out of time!

05:01.020 --> 05:04.979
There have always been risks.
But think of the good we are doing.

05:05.060 --> 05:07.699
We will save loved ones.
We will bring them back.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.259
It's why we all have sacrificed.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.217
Kelly knew the risks going into this.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.940
That's easy for you to say.
That's not your wife down there.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.532
Is it? Is it?

05:16.020 --> 05:17.578
Shh, calm down. Sit down.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.537
Sit down. Come on, Come on.

05:20.660 --> 05:23.857
Now listen to me.
I know how you feel. I really do.

05:24.380 --> 05:27.860
But do you for one minute
think I don't know what's at stake.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.693
My entire company depends
on the success of this project,

05:30.780 --> 05:33.977
and I am less concerned about losing
one life than I am of saving thousands.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.130
So I am not going to let you,
or your wife,

05:36.220 --> 05:38.973
or some petty little
Bureaucrat jeopardize this project.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.210
So shut the fuck up
and get back to your seat,

05:41.300 --> 05:43.336
because this subject is closed for good.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.138
Are we clear on this Doctor?

05:46.660 --> 05:48.059
We're clear.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.050
Excuse me.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.731
He's not going to let this go.

05:55.820 --> 05:56.855
Don't worry about it.

05:57.860 --> 05:59.860
Dr. Thorp will not be leaving Paris.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.373
Not with us at any rate.

06:10.340 --> 06:11.420
Excuse me miss,

06:11.420 --> 06:13.729
I'll take a Rum and Coke please.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.339
Oh, sorry Burrows. Rude of me.
Make that two.

06:20.580 --> 06:24.255
Right, how bout a coke.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.619
If a little bit of Bacardi were
to find its way in there,

06:28.700 --> 06:30.452
it would be our little secret, huh.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.060
Anything for you, Mr...?

06:37.060 --> 06:40.211
Uh, Burrows, Truman.
But no thank you.

06:41.020 --> 06:42.260
And I'm Frank.

06:42.260 --> 06:44.057
Frank Lee Strathmore.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.900
It's a name rich with tradition.
My umm, My family...

06:46.900 --> 06:49.494
She doesn't need to know
your family history, Frank.

06:50.820 --> 06:54.176
Look, I don't expect to be tied up long.

06:54.260 --> 06:56.455
Just a couple of parking
ticket kinda things, really.

06:56.540 --> 07:00.089
I mean, how bout you and I meet
at the Eiffel tower around Mid-Night...

07:00.180 --> 07:04.340
I'm sorry to disappoint you but Frank here,
he's going to be a little busy.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.455
That's OK.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.216
Truman, if you guys
need anything, let me know.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.775
Thank you.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.336
OK.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.370
Truman,

07:16.820 --> 07:17.889
Truman.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.178
Hmm. I guess that pretty
well does it for me.

07:20.980 --> 07:24.768
Looks like if you play your cards right,
she could be cuffing you later.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.777
You're going to shut up
and drink your coke.

07:41.780 --> 07:42.340
Hi guys.

07:42.340 --> 07:43.136
Hey.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.420
My god you are lovely.

07:47.420 --> 07:50.457
Hey stewardess. Do you think
I could get some sugar with my coffee?

07:53.380 --> 07:54.779
So, is Ally packed?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.809
She's been packed for five years.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.734
The legendary Ray Bashore retiring.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.140
So why isn't she with you
on your final flight?

08:05.140 --> 08:08.815
She insisted on staying home
to get things ready for our trip.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.299
So where are you two going?

08:10.380 --> 08:12.610
Summer vacation with the grandkids

08:12.700 --> 08:16.700
then we're on a slow ocean cruise
to Alaska. Just the two of us.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.019
That's so romantic.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.694
The ocean cruise maybe, but the kids?

08:21.380 --> 08:22.574
Sounds like a nightmare.

08:22.660 --> 08:23.456
Hey,

08:23.540 --> 08:25.132
that's great Ray, really.

08:25.220 --> 08:26.500
Thank you.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.013
Looks bad ahead huh?

08:28.660 --> 08:29.615
Um, not to worry.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.620
So, I can't wait to go shopping
at Chanel in Paris.

08:43.620 --> 08:46.420
Courtney says that
we have to go to Cartier first,

08:46.420 --> 08:47.489
and then we can go to...

08:47.580 --> 08:50.652
Yeah, well, I can't wait
to go surfing in Biarritz.

08:51.060 --> 08:51.740
Surfing?

08:51.740 --> 08:53.617
Oh yeah, we're going surfing.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.380
You can go surfing.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.051
Good.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.980
You and that slut Jackie
can go surfing all you want.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.335
Wow, hey, Tony's my friend alright?

09:01.860 --> 09:03.691
We're here to surf and you know that.

09:03.780 --> 09:07.740
And hey, his girlfriend's a total bitch
and you know that.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.340
What the hell is it with you two?

09:10.040 --> 09:11.951
I don't like her. OK?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.472
Whatever. OK.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.118
Whatever yourself.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.700
Hey YO, Tone.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.258
- Yeah?
- Gotta go long buddy.

09:22.860 --> 09:23.690
Gotta go long buddy.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.894
- Oh, oh, it hurts to get scored on.
- Stop it.

09:29.660 --> 09:30.615
You're a child.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.898
Wow, nice toss.

09:33.980 --> 09:34.571
Hey!

09:34.660 --> 09:37.049
I'll give it back to you
when I'm done playing with it.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.175
Hey.

09:38.260 --> 09:39.818
Dude, she cannot take the ball.

09:39.900 --> 09:42.289
Obviously she can. Nice toss.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.939
- Excuse me Mr. Freeman?
- Yes?

10:05.020 --> 10:06.540
Can I get your autograph?

10:06.540 --> 10:07.540
Ohh yeah, sure, sure.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.089
That final putt on the last day
of the masters, man,

10:11.180 --> 10:12.374
that was poetry.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.210
Poetry huh?

10:13.300 --> 10:13.980
Yes.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.618
Alright there, here you go.
Thank you.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.660
Thanks Mr. Freeman. Thanks a lot.

10:16.660 --> 10:17.456
No problem.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.171
Why can't they just leave us alone?

10:23.780 --> 10:26.852
You told me this was a trip away from golf
and everything that goes with it.

10:26.952 --> 10:29.200
I know and it is.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.220
Look, I promise that for rest of the trip,

10:33.220 --> 10:35.814
I'm just gonna be plain old Billy, alright?

10:36.500 --> 10:39.412
You won't even know Long Shot exists.
I promise you that.

10:40.060 --> 10:40.776
OK.

10:41.420 --> 10:42.614
I love that smile.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.300
Excuse me Mr. Freeman.

10:44.300 --> 10:44.777
Yeah?

10:44.860 --> 10:47.420
Captain Bashore would love
to meet you.

10:47.420 --> 10:48.569
When he has a break later
in the flight,

10:48.660 --> 10:50.776
would you mind
if he stops by for a visit.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.978
Yeah, it's not a problem.

10:54.460 --> 10:55.370
Thank you.

10:56.780 --> 10:57.860
You know, while you're at it,

10:57.860 --> 11:00.420
if you're done fawning over my husband,

11:01.300 --> 11:03.336
I'd love another Bloody Mary.

11:03.420 --> 11:03.980
Anna.

11:03.980 --> 11:06.740
William. I'm on vacation.

11:06.740 --> 11:09.060
I'll get you a drink right
away Mrs. Freeman.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.016
And make sure
you put some Vodka in it this time.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.380
Cause that's how I like to tee-off.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.611
Hey, there's no reason
to be so rude alright.

11:17.140 --> 11:18.971
You know I'm sure
there's someone back in coach

11:19.060 --> 11:20.573
who hasn't got your autograph yet.

11:20.660 --> 11:23.220
Maybe I'll go back there
and give it to them.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.733
You knew what you were getting
into when you married me.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.295
I thought I did.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.976
You just keep twirling
that little putter of yours.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.380
Cause that's all
you're gonna be twirling this trip.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.496
Wasn't so little last night was it?

11:43.860 --> 11:45.259
You know you've got the wrong man, right?

11:46.020 --> 11:46.940
Yeah,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.135
that's why Interpol
has your picture all over the internet.

11:49.220 --> 11:51.939
It's a classic case of mistaken identity.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.610
Yeah.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.050
Hey.

11:58.220 --> 11:58.936
Hey.

12:00.740 --> 12:04.653
Burrows, you can't treat me like this.

12:05.860 --> 12:08.980
I'm not guilty. It's not fair.

12:08.980 --> 12:11.060
Bouncing me all over the world
to stand trial here

12:11.060 --> 12:13.051
and there for something I did not do.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.055
I'm not guilty.

12:16.460 --> 12:17.097
I'm not guilty.

12:17.180 --> 12:20.140
No, I have a clear conscience.
I'm not guilty.

12:20.140 --> 12:20.936
Yeah.

12:23.860 --> 12:27.170
What is it going to take
to convince you I'm innocent.

12:29.420 --> 12:30.899
An act of god.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.773
Now shut up before I make you eat
that flotation device you're sitting on.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.694
There we go.

12:51.380 --> 12:54.975
We can fly around it but not above it.
This is a huge system.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.176
It's about 150 miles east
and west of course

12:57.260 --> 12:58.932
so it looks like either way we go,

12:59.020 --> 13:00.373
we are screwed.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.850
It's either that
or we fly all the way back around,

13:03.940 --> 13:07.091
but that's going to add 30 minutes
to our flight at least.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.380
Paris weather is not good
for our arrival.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.539
I'm gonna deviate left
and thread the needle.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.620
That gap might be our only shot
of getting around...

13:16.620 --> 13:19.293
...this system without landing for fuel.

13:29.820 --> 13:32.857
Folks, looks like it's going
to get a little bit bumpy ahead.

13:32.940 --> 13:36.620
I'd like you to remain in your seats
and wear your seatbelts.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.418
We'll probably be through this
in 10 or 15 minutes.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.899
Thank you very much.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.652
Ohh God.

14:44.780 --> 14:45.735
Did you hear that?

14:46.420 --> 14:48.172
Something must have shifted and fell.

15:05.380 --> 15:09.060
As you know Mr. Madison, a combined
strike team of the CIA and FBI

15:09.060 --> 15:12.211
seized the head-quarters
of MEDCON Labs in Los Angeles.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.211
A number of arrests were made,

15:14.300 --> 15:18.540
but we've been unable to determine
the wear-a-bouts of four key individuals.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.770
The first one, Dr. Leo Bennett.

15:20.860 --> 15:23.818
He's a head research scientist
and founder of MEDCON.

15:23.900 --> 15:28.018
Noted for his work with retro-viruses,
and synthetic biology.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.490
He was investigated two years ago
for illegal cloning research,

15:31.580 --> 15:35.095
unfortunately, that investigation failed
to produce any indictments.

15:35.180 --> 15:37.694
So far I've seen nothing
that warrants disturbing the President.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.213
Can we get to the point here?

15:39.780 --> 15:42.214
Look, we're trying
to reconstruct Bennett's hard-drive,

15:42.300 --> 15:44.734
and we think there is cause for alarm.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.375
We believe Leo Bennett is responsible

15:48.460 --> 15:51.900
for the development
of a new strain of the Malaria virus.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.609
And the containment
and transportation of Dr. Kelly Thorpe.

15:56.060 --> 15:56.856
Malaria?

15:56.940 --> 15:59.260
Initially we thought it was Malaria.

15:59.260 --> 16:03.412
However, we discovered that it was something new, something different.

16:04.140 --> 16:06.131
Bennett obtained a DNA sample from a Mosquito native

16:06.460 --> 16:08.620
to a remote area in Vietnam

16:08.620 --> 16:11.532
which had a 100% mortality rate
within seconds,

16:12.020 --> 16:14.540
which then regenerates that same organism

16:14.540 --> 16:18.540
for a few seconds or longer,
depending on the subject organism.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.820
What Bennett has developed is
a mutation of this same mosquito virus

16:21.820 --> 16:25.060
to restart major organs
for an indefinite period of time.

16:25.060 --> 16:29.133
Now what you're saying
is that his virus kills organs

16:29.220 --> 16:30.653
and then brings them back to life.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.968
Not just organs.

16:32.060 --> 16:34.494
He apparently was experimenting
on the resurrection

16:34.580 --> 16:36.969
of the entire human body after death.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.618
Oh impossible. I can't go to the president with this.

16:38.700 --> 16:39.780
Jerry, I mean come on.

16:39.780 --> 16:43.295
From what we've uncovered,
we believe he succeeded.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.368
Ah, hello?

17:48.060 --> 17:49.493
What is going on?

17:56.380 --> 17:58.769
What is happening to me?

18:47.900 --> 18:48.935
God damn it.

19:00.660 --> 19:03.413
Jesus, what now?

19:05.140 --> 19:08.018
We have electrical
and communication problems.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.370
We just had a temperature drop
in the cargo hold.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.656
This is Concord 239 to base.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.854
This is Concord 239 to base.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.697
Great, no radio.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.771
With this crap for the next hour.
Perfect.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.737
What the hell is wrong with you?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.776
I'm sick. I need help.

19:30.860 --> 19:31.975
I need help.

19:39.100 --> 19:42.934
I'm a scientist with MEDCON Labs.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.650
Where the hell is Dr. Bennett?

19:53.020 --> 19:54.976
I need to talk to someone.

19:56.220 --> 19:58.688
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

19:59.060 --> 20:00.652
Come out. I won't shoot.

20:29.460 --> 20:30.336
What the fuck.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.729
Fuck. Where is she?

20:37.060 --> 20:38.812
Oh god, oh!

20:50.380 --> 20:52.018
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.415
OK.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.251
Hey will you grab me a Diet Coke
on your way back?

20:58.020 --> 20:58.930
Sure honey.

20:59.020 --> 21:00.009
Thanks babe.

21:11.220 --> 21:12.972
Check out that dime.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.528
Wow, that is one hot little biatch.

21:21.700 --> 21:22.900
Ouch, fuck that hurt.

21:22.900 --> 21:23.969
Oh hi honey.

21:25.780 --> 21:28.977
So I guess that mid-flight blowjob
is out of the question?

21:29.740 --> 21:30.695
Such a dick.

21:30.780 --> 21:31.849
Sweetheart?

21:34.580 --> 21:35.410
What?

21:44.940 --> 21:45.611
Come here.

21:55.980 --> 21:58.420
What? What's wrong?

21:58.420 --> 22:01.969
I mean, what is somebody sees us?

22:03.140 --> 22:04.020
What are you talk...

22:04.020 --> 22:05.658
we're in a bathroom
what are you talking about?

22:05.740 --> 22:07.617
No l...you know what I mean.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.532
You're Peter's best friend.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.130
So what?

22:37.660 --> 22:38.456
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.660
Oh, pardon me.
I didn't mean to scare you.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.332
No, it's ok. I wasn't paying attention.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.809
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.
The fasten seatbelt sign is on.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.094
Yeah, yeah, um.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.420
Can I get you some more coffee? Ok.

22:47.420 --> 22:48.409
Yes, thank you.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.300
You're welcome.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.336
Oh, Megan, rhymes with Vegan.
I was a vegan.

22:52.420 --> 22:53.620
- Yeah?
- For two days.

22:53.620 --> 22:54.848
Megan Vegan.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.300
It's actually "Megan".

22:56.300 --> 22:59.019
Right, no, I knew that.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.169
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.

23:00.260 --> 23:01.693
Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.498
I just, you need to be more careful.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.300
I mean, people sneaking up
on you like that.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.858
You know, there's strange people here.

23:06.940 --> 23:09.898
You never can tell what's going
to happen on these flights.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.299
- Sir you need to take your seat.
- OK.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.655
- Thanks, thanks. Buckle-up.
- You're welcome.

23:35.740 --> 23:36.775
Jesus.

23:49.820 --> 23:50.855
Ha, wow. Cool, huh?

24:15.340 --> 24:19.652
Maybe this little diversion will keep
my mind off of your tasteless cheap suit.

24:20.740 --> 24:23.732
Would you feel better if I was
in a bitch-ass, orange jumpsuit?

24:23.820 --> 24:25.731
Like the one you are going
to be wearing the rest of your life.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.380
There you go getting nasty again

24:27.380 --> 24:29.018
when I am merely offering a criticism

24:29.100 --> 24:32.300
of the sartorial horror show you call a suit.

24:32.300 --> 24:36.179
However, I do like the shirt.
Does it come in a man's style?

24:38.860 --> 24:41.169
And for your information, the jumpsuits

24:41.260 --> 24:43.535
in France are a sort of burgundy. Yeah.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.060
Well you should look nice in that color.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.100
And now I know what color corsage

24:47.100 --> 24:49.220
to get you when big Pierre
makes you his wife.

24:49.220 --> 24:50.858
Someone sounds a wee bit jealous.

24:51.980 --> 24:52.810
Yeah.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.813
I'm going to descend a little.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.009
Is it over yet?

26:31.700 --> 26:32.894
Let's find out.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.460
This is Randy.

26:37.460 --> 26:38.688
It's Stacy.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.655
I think some of the passengers
might have been hurt.

26:41.740 --> 26:42.650
How bad?

26:44.460 --> 26:46.100
I don't know.
It's a mess down here.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.453
Well, we'll do the best we can.

26:47.660 --> 26:48.775
Just stand by.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.336
Looks like we're OK for a few minutes.

26:56.420 --> 26:59.218
Give them the "go ahead" to check.
Let me know what's what.

27:03.700 --> 27:07.249
Well folks, we apologize for the heavy
turbulence we have just experienced.

27:07.340 --> 27:09.860
It appears as though
we're clear for the moment.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.693
However, we are traveling
through some unstable air.

27:12.780 --> 27:17.251
So as a precaution I would like you
to remain in your seats for the time being.

27:17.340 --> 27:21.740
At this time, I would only like our flight
attendants up and about the cabin.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.616
Thank you.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.615
Would you make sure everyone's alright?

27:26.700 --> 27:29.772
Then have one of the Doctors,
Bennett or Sebastian,

27:29.860 --> 27:32.533
check the cargo situation out with you.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.170
The cargo?

27:36.540 --> 27:37.893
I'll get my tools.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.535
Is she ok?

27:45.620 --> 27:46.814
It's her head.

28:02.820 --> 28:04.094
You alright dude. Did you take one?

28:04.180 --> 28:06.330
The fucking bag hit me in the head.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.217
Come on, that was fun.
It was just turbulence.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.699
My god, don't be such a baby.

28:09.780 --> 28:10.690
It didn't hit you.

28:10.780 --> 28:11.769
Relax.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.892
What is your problem girl?

28:14.980 --> 28:17.289
Oh, are you scared we're going to crash?

28:17.380 --> 28:19.180
Relax bitch. Enjoy the ride.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.648
Wow, Jesus, pipe down you psycho.

28:22.340 --> 28:22.977
Shut up.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.694
What hell's wrong with you?

28:25.300 --> 28:25.980
What?

28:25.980 --> 28:27.254
You are a psycho.

28:28.020 --> 28:31.729
You know, and you're a fucking skank.
I'm so sick of your shit.

28:33.620 --> 28:34.860
Stop it!

28:34.860 --> 28:36.578
Everyone just calm down.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.218
Take your seats.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.416
And you take your seats too.

28:40.500 --> 28:41.455
Take your seats.

28:46.140 --> 28:47.414
What is wrong with you.

28:50.580 --> 28:51.700
We have several warning lights

28:51.700 --> 28:54.134
we don't usually get,
even with this weather.

28:54.220 --> 28:57.018
It's probably nothing,
but we should look just to see.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.418
I agree, why don't you two go.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.130
Both of us?

29:02.860 --> 29:03.497
Right.

29:03.860 --> 29:06.460
Well whoever is going,
meet me by that exit door.

29:06.460 --> 29:08.098
It usually takes a few minutes
to get down there

29:08.180 --> 29:09.932
and there's no easy way to go.

29:13.380 --> 29:14.415
God damn it.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.060
I told you. I told you both...

29:16.060 --> 29:17.500
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.979
Just go check on the passenger.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.215
If it was a malfunction,
Kelly might be dead.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.779
Yeah listen, don't take your eye off him.

29:25.860 --> 29:27.612
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

29:33.140 --> 29:34.460
You guys ok?

29:34.460 --> 29:35.780
I'm fine.

29:35.780 --> 29:38.420
But do you think
we could move up to business class.

29:38.420 --> 29:40.297
I mean, the planes really empty and all...

29:40.380 --> 29:41.495
- He's kidding. We're fine.
- OK.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.490
Thank you.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.693
Hey, I am trying to help you out here.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.100
She wants you. Make your move.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.818
Go boy go.

29:56.100 --> 29:58.011
I'm sorry if this is a problem.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.534
No problem. I'll take care of it.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.733
It could be dangerous.

30:03.740 --> 30:05.219
Only if you're afraid of the dark.

30:07.300 --> 30:11.418
Come on Burrows.
I need to go to the sandbox.

30:11.900 --> 30:12.457
What?

30:12.540 --> 30:13.450
I got to pee.

30:13.940 --> 30:16.818
No, you heard the PA.
Sit down and hold it.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.175
Fine.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.900
If you should happen
to feel something warm,

30:24.900 --> 30:26.652
just move a little to your right.

30:28.140 --> 30:29.493
You're like a five year old.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.572
Come on let's go.

30:36.780 --> 30:38.293
Easy. Take it slow.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.256
Yes, of course.

30:51.420 --> 30:52.409
Burrows?

30:55.940 --> 30:56.895
Burrows?

31:39.220 --> 31:40.660
Mr. Burrows,

31:40.660 --> 31:41.536
Truman.

31:42.180 --> 31:43.010
Oh my god.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.734
Alright gentleman. Here we go.

32:04.140 --> 32:05.368
Truman.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.369
Truman.

32:13.180 --> 32:13.930
What?

32:35.100 --> 32:36.852
That little shit.

32:46.580 --> 32:47.300
Flight-deck.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.814
Captain, this is Megan at door 4L.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.460
We've got a problem back here.

32:51.460 --> 32:53.371
OK. How bad is it?

32:53.460 --> 32:55.530
Mr. Burrows, the cop
who brought the prisoner on board,

32:55.620 --> 33:01.331
was knocked out cold,
and his prisoner is missing.

33:15.740 --> 33:19.140
Excuse me, have you guys seen
a funny looking skinny guy,

33:19.140 --> 33:20.573
blue sweatshirt, turtle-neck,
walk through here?

33:21.140 --> 33:21.936
No.

33:22.020 --> 33:23.612
No? No? Alright.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.935
Well that explains
the communication problem.

34:15.580 --> 34:16.649
Fry,

34:16.739 --> 34:17.580
Dr. Thorp?

34:17.580 --> 34:18.534
Kevin?

34:25.139 --> 34:26.652
Fry's not in the jump-seat.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.050
My god. This can't be happening.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.620
We need to get out of her, now.

34:35.620 --> 34:38.020
Come on. We need to seal
the hatch now. Let's move.

34:38.020 --> 34:38.815
Come on.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.297
Lucas.

34:43.860 --> 34:44.780
Kelly.

34:44.780 --> 34:45.815
Oh god.

34:47.699 --> 34:48.291
No, no!

35:59.820 --> 36:00.616
Tony?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.050
Tony?

36:20.580 --> 36:21.410
Asshole.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.018
Don't scare me like that...

36:29.100 --> 36:31.060
What? Hey, where the fuck are you going?

36:31.060 --> 36:32.015
That hurts.

36:32.115 --> 36:34.360
And don't use that kind of
language around me.

36:54.460 --> 36:55.415
Hey you two.

36:56.820 --> 36:58.856
You need to be in your seats
with the belts fastened.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.811
Why don't you make yourself
a fucking sandwich while you're at it.

37:46.940 --> 37:50.140
What have you done?
You son of a bitch.

37:50.140 --> 37:51.732
What have you brought on board?

37:57.500 --> 37:59.536
Take your seats everyone. Take your seats.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.736
Everyone just calm down.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.094
Do you know what's going on?

38:06.340 --> 38:07.329
Ray, open up.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.609
What's wrong? Randy!

38:10.260 --> 38:11.170
Ray, bring the plane down.

38:11.860 --> 38:12.497
Ray, bring the plane down.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.457
Bring the plane down right now,
or we're all going to fucking die.

38:22.580 --> 38:24.332
Tell me what the hell happened down there.

38:25.140 --> 38:26.368
Ray. The fucking, the fucking,

38:26.460 --> 38:28.620
the fucking scientists,
they let something out of the cargo-hold.

38:28.620 --> 38:30.540
What are you talking about?
Where are the doctors?

38:30.540 --> 38:32.292
They're dead. Ray, they're dead...

38:32.380 --> 38:33.859
- Sit down!
- Look at me man.

38:33.940 --> 38:36.090
Everyone's going to fucking die.
They killed them.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.932
Sit down and calm down.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.019
Sit down.

38:40.460 --> 38:41.859
Now. Sit down.

38:43.220 --> 38:44.448
What happened to you?

38:46.340 --> 38:48.808
Listen to me.
Just listen to me, Ray.

38:49.980 --> 38:52.778
If you don't land this plane soon,

38:53.500 --> 38:58.858
you, me, Emily, everybody
on this fucking plane is going to die.

38:58.940 --> 39:00.817
You know I can't bring her down
without warning

39:00.900 --> 39:03.778
and no place to land. Think about it.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.329
There is something..

39:07.220 --> 39:09.734
it's not human, down there man.

39:09.820 --> 39:12.620
And it's going to kill everyone on board
unless we land this plane.

39:12.620 --> 39:14.690
So whatever you do,
I don't care how you do it, just, just...

39:14.780 --> 39:16.540
- I need you to calm down...
- Find a place, Ray,

39:16.540 --> 39:17.859
and land the fucking plane.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.820
- Find a piece of straight fucking road.
- You know the radio's gone,

39:19.820 --> 39:21.173
and this storm isn't helping our situation.

39:21.260 --> 39:23.012
It's clear we can try to cross.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.011
But I'm turning around
and heading back.

39:25.100 --> 39:26.860
There's a TSA man aboard.

39:26.860 --> 39:29.818
Find out which passenger he is
and get him up here.

39:29.900 --> 39:30.650
Now!

39:31.260 --> 39:31.931
Ray.

39:39.820 --> 39:41.412
Are you sure that's the guy?

40:07.540 --> 40:08.689
Ok, they're dead.

40:09.460 --> 40:13.533
And you say whatever killed them,
wasn't human.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.771
I know it sounds insane.

40:16.380 --> 40:17.700
I saw this happen.

40:17.700 --> 40:20.851
I mean those things,
I mean they ripped those men apart

40:20.940 --> 40:22.532
and they were eating them.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.975
You said there was a fugitive on board.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.820
Is it possible you saw him down there?

40:26.820 --> 40:28.048
No.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.220
I told you. There were two of them

40:30.220 --> 40:33.974
and these...these things aren't human.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.177
I'm going to go find out
what was in those containers.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.454
Where are you going?

40:39.540 --> 40:41.820
I'm going to go talk
to that asshole Bennett cause he knows.

40:41.820 --> 40:42.775
Sit down.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.378
Well, I'll check it out and report back.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.615
Any sign of him?

41:00.500 --> 41:01.216
No.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.100
Shoot.

41:02.100 --> 41:02.980
How's your head?

41:02.980 --> 41:05.050
Better than my ego.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.814
Come on, he can't hide forever.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.539
As soon as the turbulence settles,
I'm going to go look for him some more.

41:09.980 --> 41:11.620
Don't go alone.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.815
Why? Is he dangerous?

41:13.900 --> 41:16.209
Well, he's probably never owned
a weapon before,

41:16.300 --> 41:17.733
but he's more
of a con-artist than anything.

41:17.820 --> 41:19.617
What did he do? Can you tell me?

41:20.820 --> 41:22.333
He posed as an accountant,

41:22.433 --> 41:24.640
skimmed 35 millions of the Russian mob,

41:24.740 --> 41:26.537
stole their Jet and crash-landed it.

41:26.620 --> 41:29.259
And we finally caught up to him.
Everybody wants him.

41:30.860 --> 41:32.179
Why are you taking him to Paris?

41:38.140 --> 41:38.980
You ok?

41:38.980 --> 41:39.856
Yes.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.089
You should take your seat.

41:42.180 --> 41:43.499
OK. Be careful.

41:43.580 --> 41:44.217
OK

41:49.380 --> 41:52.611
Hey look at this.
I think I found Concord 239.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.140
Nobody's been able to reach them
for over an hour.

42:00.140 --> 42:02.335
Los Angeles dispatch,
this is Yellow-Knife-Center.

42:02.420 --> 42:05.378
I believe I have your concord 239
on my screen.

42:06.460 --> 42:08.060
It's in the middle
of two huge weather fronts.

42:08.060 --> 42:10.210
And transponder indicates it's off course.

42:11.340 --> 42:13.490
No, no radio contact yet. I'll try now.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.455
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

42:20.820 --> 42:22.697
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.853
Los Angeles Dispatch,

42:27.260 --> 42:28.659
yes I understand.

42:33.100 --> 42:37.540
I repeat, you must tell 239
to return to US airspace.

42:37.540 --> 42:40.100
The Canadian government
will not permit them to land

42:40.100 --> 42:42.375
or continue to fly in their airspace.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.132
This decision has come
from the highest level

42:44.232 --> 42:46.680
of the Canadian government as well as the
US State Department

42:46.780 --> 42:48.532
and the CDC. Is that clear?

42:48.940 --> 42:53.058
Can you tell me what it is
you're transporting in the cargo-hold?

42:53.580 --> 42:54.410
I'm sorry.

42:54.500 --> 42:57.970
My cargo is a highly classified project
linked to our nation's security.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.933
You don't have the necessary clearance.

43:00.020 --> 43:02.375
I'm with the TSA, Federal Air-Marshall.

43:02.460 --> 43:04.380
I need to know what's down there.

43:04.380 --> 43:08.578
Well how fortunate for us to have a man
with your obvious talents aboard.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.769
You seem a bit nervous Doc.

43:13.860 --> 43:15.213
Is everything alright?

43:15.700 --> 43:16.894
Just don't like flying.

43:17.860 --> 43:19.980
Isn't it true your
two colleagues accompanied

43:19.980 --> 43:22.175
the co-pilot down to the cargo-hold

43:22.260 --> 43:23.773
because there was some problem.

43:23.860 --> 43:24.610
No, no problem.

43:24.700 --> 43:25.940
No problem?

43:25.940 --> 43:27.453
It's just a routine mid-flight inspection.

43:27.540 --> 43:28.973
Routine.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.812
What I can tell you,

43:31.900 --> 43:33.580
while the cargo isn't dangerous,

43:33.580 --> 43:36.777
it's highly perishable
and extremely valuable.

43:36.860 --> 43:39.977
So, the cargo area is off limits
to unauthorized personnel.

43:40.740 --> 43:43.049
- Well, can you tell me...
- No, I'm sorry.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.937
I've said more
than I should have already.

44:09.860 --> 44:10.656
Burrows?

44:11.980 --> 44:12.420
Yeah.

44:12.420 --> 44:16.129
Paul Judd, TSA. I believe
your prisoner is in the cargo-hold.

44:20.900 --> 44:21.696
Ready?

44:40.900 --> 44:41.776
Hey Frank.

44:47.180 --> 44:47.851
Frank.

44:48.740 --> 44:50.970
Frank. Get out here.

44:51.060 --> 44:52.209
Dr. Thorp.

44:53.380 --> 44:54.699
Dr. Sebastian.

45:02.060 --> 45:03.175
Anybody out there?

45:04.580 --> 45:05.808
That's a lot of blood.

45:05.900 --> 45:07.580
Somebody's in trouble.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.696
Yeah, if it's Frank's
he needs help now.

45:24.580 --> 45:25.330
Check that out.

45:27.020 --> 45:28.772
Looks like he escaped
through the ducts.

45:29.860 --> 45:30.690
I don't know.

45:31.820 --> 45:34.288
That's an awful lot of blood
for a skinny little shit like Frank.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.579
You go that way. I'll go this way.

45:38.060 --> 45:39.459
Meet back in 5.

45:39.540 --> 45:40.336
Yes.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.289
Hey Frank.

46:06.940 --> 46:08.168
You there buddy?

46:11.580 --> 46:13.696
Why don't you come out
and talk to me, man?

46:14.420 --> 46:16.012
Everything's alright. It's cool.

46:17.460 --> 46:19.052
We can just talk. It's just me.

46:22.140 --> 46:23.289
Frankie.

46:28.700 --> 46:30.372
I'm going to kill that little shit.

46:33.260 --> 46:37.378
Alright, I'm coming up.

46:47.780 --> 46:48.576
Yes.

46:50.660 --> 46:51.615
You're sure?

46:53.740 --> 46:54.650
Outstanding.

46:55.340 --> 46:56.329
Thank you Lieutenant.

46:58.460 --> 47:00.540
They have located Bennett and his team.

47:00.540 --> 47:01.814
Hallelujah.

47:28.860 --> 47:31.818
You know Frank,
sometimes this job is really boring.

47:32.380 --> 47:34.257
This is not one of those times, bud.

47:35.580 --> 47:37.138
You're making this real exciting.

47:43.820 --> 47:45.094
Son of a bitch.

48:09.940 --> 48:10.736
Paul?

48:27.500 --> 48:28.410
Frank?

48:52.980 --> 48:53.776
Oh my god.

48:53.860 --> 48:54.815
Oh my god I'm going to be sick.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.130
Oh my god.
Cara where the fuck are you going.

48:57.220 --> 48:58.733
What the fuck?

48:58.820 --> 49:00.936
Tony, this bitch just got shot dude.

49:01.020 --> 49:03.056
There's fucking bullets coming
from somewhere.

49:10.580 --> 49:11.620
Please take your seats.

49:11.620 --> 49:13.531
Take your seats. Everything's fine.

49:13.620 --> 49:14.735
Please, take your seats.

49:14.860 --> 49:16.220
Everything's fine.

49:16.220 --> 49:17.096
Thank you.

49:24.780 --> 49:27.419
Ray, it's total chaos down here.

49:27.500 --> 49:31.539
There were gunshots or something
that freaked out the passengers.

49:41.260 --> 49:42.090
Emily?

49:42.900 --> 49:44.379
Go, take the gun.

50:38.020 --> 50:40.295
My god, this can't be happening.

50:41.660 --> 50:44.732
Get back.
Go back to your seats and stay there.

50:46.540 --> 50:47.450
Go back.

51:17.580 --> 51:19.059
Move, move, move, move.

51:22.420 --> 51:23.136
Get out of my way.

51:23.220 --> 51:24.938
Cara. Cara.

51:25.860 --> 51:27.220
Cara, open the door.

51:27.220 --> 51:27.891
Move.

51:27.980 --> 51:28.696
Cara.

51:39.020 --> 51:39.975
Oh shit.

51:40.060 --> 51:41.175
Dude, what the fuck?

51:41.260 --> 51:43.057
Get back. Get back. Get back.

51:43.140 --> 51:43.811
Get back.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.652
Get out of here. Get out of here.

51:46.580 --> 51:47.490
Cara.

51:47.580 --> 51:49.730
- Stay back there. Stay back there.
- Cara.

51:49.820 --> 51:51.100
What the fuck, dude?

51:51.100 --> 51:51.896
What is this?

51:54.060 --> 51:55.095
- Christ.
- Holy shit.

51:55.180 --> 51:56.772
Get off him. Get off him.

52:32.140 --> 52:34.210
What the fuck? What the fuck?

52:38.820 --> 52:40.219
What the fuck is going on?

52:40.580 --> 52:41.979
Please, please,

52:43.180 --> 52:45.978
please go back to your seats.

52:46.860 --> 52:47.780
Oh my god.

52:47.780 --> 52:48.576
Oh my god.

52:48.660 --> 52:49.251
Oh my god.

52:49.340 --> 52:54.740
Oh my god, what happened?

52:54.740 --> 52:57.049
What the fuck happened?

53:06.700 --> 53:08.577
Please take your seats.

53:17.500 --> 53:18.615
Flight-deck.

53:18.700 --> 53:20.930
Ray, something's happened down here.

53:22.140 --> 53:25.769
Something attacked one
of the passengers, and he's dead.

53:25.860 --> 53:27.612
You got to get us down, Ray.

53:27.700 --> 53:28.735
Oh my god.

53:28.820 --> 53:30.540
- Megan, listen to me.
- You don't understand.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.212
There's blood everywhere.

53:32.300 --> 53:35.770
And, and Stacy
and one of the other passengers was hurt.

53:35.860 --> 53:37.259
How did it happen?
Who attacked you?

53:39.060 --> 53:41.820
I don't know,
um, maybe the escaped prisoner.

53:41.820 --> 53:43.014
I can't think of anyone else.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.060
Look, Megan

53:44.060 --> 53:46.699
we've turned around and we'll land
the first place we can find.

53:46.780 --> 53:49.374
But the only way back is through
the center of the storm.

53:51.140 --> 53:54.098
We need to get the passengers
back to their seats now.

53:54.780 --> 53:55.735
OK.

54:41.900 --> 54:44.175
I'm scared Meg.

55:07.540 --> 55:08.529
Oh, my god!

55:20.820 --> 55:21.536
Shit.

55:23.060 --> 55:24.493
Help me.

55:25.220 --> 55:26.050
Open.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.651
Oh, shit.
They're going to kill us all.

55:28.740 --> 55:30.731
I really should go check
on the passengers.

55:43.780 --> 55:44.769
Open this door.

55:44.860 --> 55:45.700
Help me.

55:45.700 --> 55:47.736
For Christ's sake, they are going to kills us all.

55:47.820 --> 55:50.460
Open the fucking door.

55:50.460 --> 55:51.859
God damn it. Help me.

56:34.700 --> 56:35.450
Bill?

56:39.060 --> 56:39.810
Hey. What's going on?

56:39.900 --> 56:42.860
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- What's going on man?

56:42.860 --> 56:44.930
I can't explain.
We've got to get out of here.

56:45.020 --> 56:49.616
- They're going to kill us.
- Calm down and tell me what's going on.

56:51.180 --> 56:52.780
What is going on, man?

56:52.780 --> 56:53.895
We need to hide.

56:53.980 --> 56:55.660
We need to hide.

56:55.660 --> 56:58.254
We need to get out of here,
or we're going to die.

57:23.780 --> 57:25.372
Bill, where are you going?

58:03.660 --> 58:04.888
Come on, come on.

58:05.460 --> 58:05.900
Where?

58:05.900 --> 58:08.733
Back-galley. The floors 2 feet thick.
It's the only safe place.

58:08.820 --> 58:10.094
I can't, I can't my wife is upstairs.

58:12.940 --> 58:15.100
Well get her and get back
there as soon as you can.

58:15.100 --> 58:16.215
Come on, now. Come on.

58:52.300 --> 58:53.653
Hey you, come on.

58:53.740 --> 58:55.253
- Help me get this open.
- Tell me something.

58:55.980 --> 58:57.379
It's the only place we can find.

58:59.380 --> 59:00.495
Shh, shh, be quiet.

59:01.940 --> 59:04.780
Hey, you, you get in there.
See if you can see anything.

59:04.780 --> 59:06.099
Go on. Get up. Get up.

59:07.980 --> 59:09.857
See anything?

59:09.940 --> 59:10.860
Help me!

59:10.860 --> 59:12.339
Come on baby.

59:16.620 --> 59:17.530
Come on...

59:20.380 --> 59:21.335
Stacy!

59:30.435 --> 59:31.600
Duck!

59:47.700 --> 59:49.060
Oh my god.

59:49.060 --> 59:50.652
Are you alright? No bites?

59:50.740 --> 59:52.219
We thought. We thought...

59:52.300 --> 59:54.740
What? That it was me gnawing
on all the passengers?

59:54.740 --> 59:56.378
No. I'm a vegetarian.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.139
The overall feeling among the scientists

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.338
working on this is that we are dealing
with a serum transfer virus.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.208
This virus is without
a known vaccine or cure.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.538
But this type virus transfers
only through bodily fluids.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.817
And then most effectively,
blood from an infect victim.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.940
And it enters a cut or saliva.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.140
The MEDCON scientists believed
they could make this work,

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.779
despite the side-effects.
That of being brought back from the dead.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.540
In fact, they looked
at these side-effects as a benefit.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.089
Let me paraphrase these notes
that we found on Dr. Bennett's desk.

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.048
They wanted this virus as a bio-weapon.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.580
To keep soldiers fighting
after they've been mortally wounded.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:55.210
To release a captive enemy infected
with the virus and let him infect others

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.449
until they all kill each other.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.008
I'm going to recommend
to you and to the president

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.533
that we destroy flight 239
before it can reach a populated area.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.369
Let me get this straight.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.580
You want our forces to follow a shoot

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.094
to kill order regarding
a civilian aircraft?

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.292
We've had no communication with the aircraft.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.408
We must assume the cargo has been breached

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.855
and that the virus has spread
throughout the passenger section.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.453
The only chance we have to contain

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.453
this is to vaporize every living thing aboard that aircraft.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.498
Before the virus can reach
a major population center.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.813
Do you concur?

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.855
I'm afraid I do.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.178
Can you get me the president please?

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.733
Mother of god.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.220
Get off of her. Get off.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.050
Get off.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.569
Oh my god.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.410
Why? Why'd you do this huh?

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.940
Hey, I'm talking to you, man.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.137
It wasn't me.
I was just following orders.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.900
They told me it was
an experiment to extend life.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.780
I had no idea there
would be these crazy side-effects.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.420
Well look around you asshole.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.570
Your side-effects
have eaten half the passengers.

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.220
Hey, I don't have to listen to you.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:18.575
You were the one that seemed
like you were giving all the orders.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.775
You were the one
that the cop was talking to.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.815
And you were the one
that sent the others below.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.889
I heard all of that.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.129
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.369
It wasn't me I tell you.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.688
Hey, keep your voice down.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.059
Well you just keep talking.
You'll draw their attention.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.100
It's starting
to get really tight in here.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.091
Yeah, yeah,
I think we're getting closer.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.411
Ray. Ray, I'm hurt.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.933
Open up. Hurry.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.690
Ray.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:17.850
Hurry.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.216
Oh my god.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.495
I don't know if that's going to work.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.729
It has to work.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.853
Let's get the other side.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.690
OK.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.219
Two in the chest.
One in the balls. That's what I say.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:25.815
It's barricaded.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.173
Ah, Frank I see you.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.334
You get that?
He is a little beaver.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.655
Come on.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.294
- Oh my god.
- Come here Frank.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.374
Where have you been?

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.460
Where have I been?

01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.256
Where have you been?

01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:58.900
Where have you been?

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.209
- I have been up and down this plane looking
- So have l.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.050
Hey, back off.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.220
Statistically speaking, the tail section
is the safest place to be in a crash.

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.812
- Of course, no one...
- Frank, not now.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.128
Help me with this.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.653
Go get something else.

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.620
- Get something else.
- I am.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.609
Do it.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.019
Right there.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.211
I can't lift. There's a... wait.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.330
Frank.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:00.774
Wait, wait, wait, shh.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.215
Quiet, quiet. I hear something.

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.129
I don't hear anything.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:13.616
Go.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.252
Hold on. Hold on.

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:32.254
Oh my god, baby.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.140
OK, we got to go. We got to go.

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:46.810
We got to go.

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:48.332
Go, go, go, go.

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.255
Alright, we need to find anything
that can be used as a weapon.

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.492
Does anyone have anything sharp.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.700
They confiscated my toenail-clippers.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.772
Pearl handled with
matching tweezers. Quite lovely.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:01.140
Damn Frank, you should have brought those.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:01.970
You could have saved the day.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:02.899
You never know.

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:04.460
How much ammunition do you have left?

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.814
I got five in here and one clip.
What about you?

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.572
One full clip. Five more.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.536
Shit.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.176
Maybe we could electrocute
the bastards.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:16.488
- No, no.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:20.813
I guess that could have gone better.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.292
Frank, you stupid shit.
Please tell me you're dead.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.849
Where'd you find him?

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:37.050
The auxiliary lights...

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:37.979
Oh my god.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:42.098
The auxiliary lights will come
on any second. I hope.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:46.099
Frank. We need to find weapons.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.099
Still no answer from the cockpit?

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.010
Nothing.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.448
I can't believe everyone's dead.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:08.893
My god, we're going to die.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.289
Megan. Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.699
- We are not going to die...
- No?

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.657
No, we're not going to die.
I promise you.

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:18.532
I need your help.
I need you to be strong.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.211
Right.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.369
Did you see that?

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.609
What the hell was that?

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.416
Listen.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.170
Someone's up there.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.650
Don't shoot.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.451
We need to have a plan to get
this plane down safely.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.178
Does anyone know
if the pilot's still alive?

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.375
I, I tried to reach him.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.370
Try him again.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.451
OK.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.899
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.811
The captain is dead.
We're on auto-pilot.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:35.730
So what,

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.253
- we just fly around till they get us?
- - No.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.531
Or until we run out of fuel.
Actually, that might be preferred.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:41.889
- Run out of fuel?
- Yeah.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.857
Hey, we got to get to the flight-deck
to check on the captain.

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.620
We got to do this now before
they start coming at us.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.380
I don't think you have enough bullets
to make it to the cockpit.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.211
The guard down below has a weapon.

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.130
We need that weapon.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.260
That's our only chance.
- Absolutely.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.659
So what? You're just going
to go down there?

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:55.129
Down there. How do we know
he didn't use all the ammo already.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.494
We don't know, Frank.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:29.377
It's good to know that you still have
a sense of humor in a time like this.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.460
I know it's not much to look at
but with any luck,

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.140
it's going to buy me enough time
to get that weapon

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.893
and get back here
without tearing the plane apart.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:35.969
Why are you doing this?

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.779
I made a promise to someone.

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.888
I keep my promises.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.259
I have radar contact with Concord 239.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.856
Should have visual in two minutes.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:03.820
Burrows, in case this blows up
anything important,

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.651
do you mind
if I take out your new girlfriend?

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.056
Hey Bennett.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.569
Got something for you.

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.735
Roger. Try to establish contact.
You have three minutes from my mark.

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.492
Mark minus three minutes.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.860
Roger that.
Mark minus three minutes.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.620
Try to establish contact.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.451
I'm going to circle and signal.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.655
Look.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.213
I'd like to think
that's the Calvary, but um.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.290
What do you mean?

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.613
We don't have much time.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:54.020
Well, aren't they going to save us?

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.499
No. They're not going to save us.

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.260
There's just us.
Unless we let him know we're alive,

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.488
he's going to shoot us down.

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.700
They can't do that.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:01.849
He's right.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.613
Unless we answer them,
they're going to fire the missile at us.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.613
What do we do?

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:07.849
We answer him.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.692
Someone needs to get to the cockpit,
and signal that jet.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.293
Does anybody know how to fly a jet?

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.855
Anyone? Anyone?

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.220
You can fly a jet?

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.180
Well, not officially.
But I know most of the basics.

01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.056
Basics?

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.732
Of course, it's been awhile.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:26.539
We just need to get to the radio and use it.

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.608
We need to go now, Frank.

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:33.100
Alright. Count me in.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.011
No, no, no, Billy don't leave me.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:35.940
I'll go. I'll go.

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:37.578
No. Stay here.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.934
I'm going to do my part.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.851
- Why?
- I'll see you soon, baby.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.289
I'll see you soon.

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.130
Let's go.

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.974
Such a big mouth.

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.892
Nice drive.

01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.250
Command, this is 431.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.170
Go ahead.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.615
239 has no one
in control that I can see.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.215
Repeat, 239 has no one
in control that I can see.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.489

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:07.650
Billy.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.539

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.533
Get out of my way, you stupid bitch!

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.258
You don't know who you're dealing with.

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.934
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:49.770

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.174
Go. Go.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.817
No response to my signals.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.050
You are clear to engage 239.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.732
Command, please repeat.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.140
You are clear to engage 239.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.177
Roger that.
Clear to engage contact with 239.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:29.936
Hold on, baby.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:35.450
I love you.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.378
I love you too, baby.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.573

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.535
Is that you Bennett?

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.173
Oh shit.

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:00.693
Come on mother fucker.

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.460
I want to make sure you keep
that shit eating grin on your face

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.813
all the way to hell.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.929
Command, this is 431.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.454
It appears
that engine number 3 is burning.

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.017
She's gumming me to death.

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.009
Go, go, go, go.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.849
Where's the auto-pilot?

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:25.534
- I don't know. You asking me Frank?
- This is different.

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.417
This is different.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:28.460
Don't yell at me.

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.734
I'm not yelling.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:37.970
I have lock.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.810
We're alive. I repeat we're alive.

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.936
Abort. Abort.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.136
Missile away.

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:57.137
Incoming object. Incoming object.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.060
They must have launched a missile.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:21:59.980
Frank we got seconds.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.414
- I know. Where is the auto-pilot?
- I don't know.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.060
Collision imminent. Collision imminent.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.020
Here, here.

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.820
Auto-pilot off.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.731
What do I do?

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.129
- Ready.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.100
We got live civilians.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.170
Aborting, repeat, I am aborting.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.729

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.215
Oh shit.

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:17.651
Frank.

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:19.540
Frank.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.380
Yes.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.495
Mountain.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.975

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.971
You did it my friend.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:31.580
Did you ever consider going out
with an ex-cop?

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.253
I went out with a cop once.

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:35.816
Oh yeah?

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.457
Yeah, the only thing he was good
for was scratching my back

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.420
when I couldn't reach.

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:43.014
Do you ever get that itch anymore?

01:25:44.476 --> 01:25:45.157
All the time.
