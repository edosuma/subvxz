A DRONE.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.097
A DRONE?

11:47.097 --> 11:48.838
[scoffs]
WOW, THAT'S CRAZY.

11:48.838 --> 11:49.970
RUN IT AGAIN.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.449
SURE.[cell phone rings]

11:51.449 --> 11:53.147
EXCUSE ME.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.452
HEY, GRACE.

11:54.452 --> 11:55.976
HEY, GOOD-LOOKIN'.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.805
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU
WHEN I LEFT, BUT, UH,

11:58.805 --> 12:01.024
THAT WAS PRETTY SPECTACULAR
LAST NIGHT.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.678
YEAH, IT WAS.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.375
HEY, I'M FREE TONIGHT.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.203
SOUNDS GOOD.
SO I WAS THINKING, UH,

12:06.203 --> 12:09.163
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DISCUSS
THE, UH, NEW AGENDA WITH

12:09.163 --> 12:10.991
a focus on a significantly

12:10.991 --> 12:13.689
NEW APPROACH TO...
SOMETHING.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.386
SOMEONE JUST WALK BY?

12:15.386 --> 12:17.693
YEAH. WHAT WERE YOU
CALLING ABOUT?

12:17.693 --> 12:20.914
UH, TITUS STONE.
NO ARRESTS,

12:20.914 --> 12:23.220
NO FAMILY IN STATE.
A COUSIN IN MINNEAPOLIS.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.701
She's been informed.
He worked for a company

12:25.701 --> 12:27.616
CALLED MODERN AERODYNAMICS.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.574
ACCORDING TO THEIR WEB SITE,
THEY DESIGN

12:29.574 --> 12:31.228
UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.317
You know what those are?DRONES?

12:33.317 --> 12:35.798
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.241
PATRICK.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.374
DR. MILLER.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.768
[cell phone rings] SOPHIE.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.856
[faint indistinct voice speaks]

12:49.856 --> 12:51.596
[rings]

12:54.121 --> 12:55.383
WHAT'S UP, CHO?

12:55.383 --> 12:57.254
ARE YOU WORKING THIS CASE?

12:57.254 --> 12:59.430
I'M ALWAYS WORKING THE CASE.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.867
RIGSBY'S GOING
TO THE VICTIM'S HOUSE,

13:00.867 --> 13:02.477
AND I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO SOME PEOPLE ABOUT DRONES.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.523
MM. DRONES.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.351
THAT'S NEW.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.918
COUNT ME IN.All right.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.180
BYE.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.584
[sighs] HELLO.
I'M KRIS MAKKENA.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.238
I'M ONE OF
THE COMPANY'S PRESIDENTS.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.979
AGENT KIMBALL CHO,
CBI.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.633
THIS IS PATRICK JANE.HELLO.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.463
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST, UH...
IT WAS A VERY HARD MORNING.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.944
UM... MY PARTNER IS
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM,

13:34.944 --> 13:36.772
IF YOU'LL COME THIS WAY.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.295
[Patrick] SO YOU
MAKE DRONES HERE?

13:38.295 --> 13:40.994
[Kris] UH, WE DESIGN THEM.
WE DON'T MANUFACTURE.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.647
[Cho] WHAT DID TITUS STONE
DO FOR YOU?

13:42.647 --> 13:44.606
TITUS HAD BEEN WITH US
SINCE WE STARTED THE COMPANY.

13:44.606 --> 13:45.999
HE WAS OUR DESIGN CHIEF.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.870
HE WAS A GENIUS.
HE WAS OUR GENIUS.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.350
HE WAS--HE WAS BRILLIANT.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.830
[sighs]MM, "GENIUS"
AND "BRILLIANT"--

13:50.830 --> 13:52.222
USUALLY SYNONYMS
FOR "DIFFICULT."

13:52.222 --> 13:54.964
UH, WELL,
HE WAS A TAD ECCENTRIC

13:54.964 --> 13:57.445
AND SOCIALLY AWKWARD AT TIMES,
DIDN'T ALWAYS GET PEOPLE,

13:57.445 --> 13:59.926
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE ALL ADORED HIM.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.405
I DOUBT THAT.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.539
ELLIOTT.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.543
ELLIOTT WINSTON.
I RUN THE COMPANY WITH KRIS.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.153
AGENT CHO, IS IT?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.677
THAT'S RIGHT.OUR ATTORNEY SAYS
THAT YOU THINK

14:12.677 --> 14:14.331
A U.A.V. KILLED TITUS.

14:14.331 --> 14:17.247
IS THAT TRUE?U.A.V...

14:17.247 --> 14:19.771
AN UNMANNED VEHICLE.
IT'S A DRONE.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.599
AH.WE'RE LOOKING
INTO THAT.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.166
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.733
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.343
OUR PRODUCT ISN'T VERY POPULAR
IN CERTAIN QUARTERS

14:26.343 --> 14:27.779
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.869
OR INSIDE THE COUNTRY,
FOR THAT MATTER.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.959
IF A U.A.V. WAS INVOLVED
IN THIS, IT'S CLEAR--

14:32.959 --> 14:35.875
SOMEONE DECIDED TO USE
POOR TITUS AS A PROP

14:35.875 --> 14:39.095
IN A PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE
PIECE OF POLITICAL THEATER,

14:39.095 --> 14:40.444
WHICH IS SIMPLY--OH, ELLIOTT--

14:40.444 --> 14:42.707
SIMPLY... TERRORISM.

14:42.707 --> 14:46.320
THE F.B.I. SHOULD BE HERE,
NOT A... STATE AGENCY.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.887
WE'RE IN CONTACT
WITH THE F.B.I.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.366
IF WE FIND EVIDENCE
OF TERRORISM,

14:49.366 --> 14:50.933
WE'LL TAKE
THE APPROPRIATE STEPS.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.022
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S A HOMICIDE.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.720
NOW... WAS STONE HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH ANYONE ELSE HERE?

14:55.720 --> 14:59.376
UH... NOTHING SERIOUS,
NOT THAT WE KNEW ABOUT.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.856
WHAT WAS HE WORKING ON?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.858
HE STARTED A NEW LINE
OF PRODUCT, UH,

15:02.858 --> 15:04.164
BUT HE'D JUST COMPLETED WORK
ON A PROJECT

15:04.164 --> 15:05.905
CALLED THE REDBIRD,

15:05.905 --> 15:08.211
WHICH WE DELIVERED TO
THE MILITARY A FEW MONTHS BACK.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.778
THE REDBIRD?MM-HMM.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.606
WELL, THAT'S A COOL NAME.
IS THAT THE KIND OF DRONE

15:11.606 --> 15:13.869
THAT SHOOTS MISSILES
AND BLOWS UP

15:13.869 --> 15:16.350
TRUCKS AND HOUSES, STUFF?

15:16.350 --> 15:19.135
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.I SEE.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.355
REDBIRD. IS IT RED?

15:21.355 --> 15:23.879
NO. BLACK.
WHAT IS THE POINT HERE?

15:23.879 --> 15:26.142
THERE IS NONE, JUST THAT
MERE MENTION OF IT

15:26.142 --> 15:27.927
MAKES BOTH OF YOU TENSE.
WHY IS THAT?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.667
OUR WORK FOR THE PENTAGON
IS COVERED

15:29.667 --> 15:31.539
BY STRICT
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS,

15:31.539 --> 15:33.802
SO TECHNICALLY,
ADMITTING THE REDBIRD EXISTS

15:33.802 --> 15:35.630
IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.762
WE COULD ALL GO TO JAIL JUST
FOR HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.461
WELL, THAT COULD EXPLAIN IT.
COULD.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.506
SOME NUT OUT THERE WHO THINKS
WE'RE WAR CRIMINALS

15:42.506 --> 15:44.204
HAS DRAWN A TARGET ON OUR BACK.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.857
THAT'S WHO YOU SHOULD BE
LOOKING FOR.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.469
MAYBE.
NOW WHERE DOES STONE WORK?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.646
THIS IS NICHOLAS VASHUM.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.474
HE WAS TITUS'
RESEARCH ASSISTANT.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.693
ANYTHING ELSE, LET ME KNOW.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.261
DUDE. JANE. CHO.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.176
HEY.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.525
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BUGS?

16:01.525 --> 16:03.614
OH, UM, WE'VE BEEN
WORKING ON U.A.V.s

16:03.614 --> 16:05.138
THAT MIMIC INSECT FLIGHT,

16:05.138 --> 16:07.792
AND TITUS SAID HAVING
IMAGES AROUND HELPED.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.794
[Cho] WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO MIMIC INSECT FLIGHT?

16:09.794 --> 16:11.448
SO YOU CAN MAKE
THE DRONE REALLY SMALL,

16:11.448 --> 16:13.189
LIKE THE SIZE OF A MOSQUITO.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.931
IT COULD LAND ON YOUR SHIRT
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.541
CREEPY.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.326
I GUESS.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.719
WE HEAR STONE CAN BE DIFFICULT.
YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH HIM?

16:21.719 --> 16:24.809
NO. GOD, NO. NO, NO.
I GOT HIM, YOU KNOW?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.507
LIKE, WHAT WAS
IN TITUS' HEAD

16:26.507 --> 16:28.726
WAS WAY MORE REAL TO HIM
THAN WHAT WAS OUTSIDE OF IT.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.641
LIKE... OTHER PEOPLE.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.600
LIKE, HE STARTED THIS DIET
A FEW MONTHS BACK,

16:32.600 --> 16:35.995
AND IF I BROUGHT IN FOOD--
LIKE, ANY FOOD--

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
HE WOULD THROW ME OUT
OF THE ROOM

16:37.997 --> 16:39.955
AND SAY I WAS SABOTAGING HIM
AND... YOU KNOW.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.652
[inhales] YOU KNOW.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.090
WHAT DID STONE DO
IN HIS FREE TIME?

16:44.090 --> 16:46.353
UH, HE PLAYED A LOT
OF VIDEOGAMES,

16:46.353 --> 16:48.181
HE WATCHED A LOT OF MOVIES.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.834
SAMURAI MOVIES, I'M THINKING.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.793
YEAH, HE WAS REALLY INTO
THAT KUNG FU STUFF.

16:51.793 --> 16:55.318
MORE KUROSAWA THAN KUNG FU.
WAS HE SEEING SOMEONE?

16:55.318 --> 16:58.669
YOU MEAN, LIKE, A WOMAN?
UM... NO.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.932
WHAT ABOUT HOOKERS?

17:00.932 --> 17:03.587
WHAT--WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE DID THAT?

17:03.587 --> 17:06.242
WELL, LONELY OVERWEIGHT GUY
GOES ON A DIET--

17:06.242 --> 17:07.983
HE'S TRYING TO IMPRESS
SOMEONE.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.593
YEAH, HE DIDN'T...
MENTION THAT TO ME.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.423
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE REDBIRD?

17:13.423 --> 17:15.425
AND YOU CAN SPEAK FREELY,
'CAUSE CHO AND I

17:15.425 --> 17:17.297
HAVE TOP LEVEL
SECURITY CLEARANCE.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.733
MM... NOTHING.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.387
I DIDN'T WORK MUCH
ON THE REDBIRD.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.953
YOUR BOSS SAYS YOU GET THREATS
FROM PEOPLE

17:21.953 --> 17:23.520
WHO DON'T LIKE DRONES.
THAT TRUE?

17:23.520 --> 17:25.348
YEAH. THAT HAPPENS.
IT'S SCARY.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.655
THERE'S SOME HARDCORE HATERS
OUT THERE.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.223
I'LL BET.

17:30.223 --> 17:32.486
I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

17:35.489 --> 17:38.100
IF THAT'S STONE'S LAPTOP,
I'M GONNA NEED TO TAKE IT.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.233
OOH, UH, I'LL HAVE TO ASK.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.365
IT PROBABLY HAS SOME
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ON THERE.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.324
YOU GUYS REALLY HAVE
TOP SECURITY CLEARANCE?

17:44.324 --> 17:45.716
NO.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.894
Hi. You've reached
the voicemail

17:49.894 --> 17:51.505
of Dr. Sophie Miller.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.333
If this is a true
psychiatric emergency,

17:53.333 --> 17:56.553
please call 9-1-1 and seek
immediate assistance.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.381
Otherwise, leave a message,
and I'll get back to you

17:58.381 --> 17:59.948
as quickly as I can.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.740
GRACE, I WANT YOU TO STOP
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

18:09.740 --> 18:11.525
AND LOOK UP
AN ADDRESS FOR ME.

18:18.662 --> 18:21.100
WE RAN STONE'S CREDIT CARDS.
JANE WAS RIGHT.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.927
HE WAS HIRING PROSTITUTES
THROUGH AN ESCORT SERVICE

18:22.927 --> 18:24.233
CALLED PRIVATE COMPANION.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.669
YOU GET ANY NAMES?

18:25.669 --> 18:27.280
YEAH, A WOMAN NAMED
CAROL MATHEWS

18:27.280 --> 18:28.759
WAS WITH STONE
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.761
RIGSBY'S BRINGING HER IN.AND WHAT ABOUT THE LAPTOP?

18:30.761 --> 18:32.894
ANY PROBLEMS
WITH SECURITY CLEARANCE?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.461
NO, WE TOLD THE F.B.I. WE ONLY
WANTED TO LOOK AT HIS CALENDAR

18:34.461 --> 18:36.289
AND CORRESPONDENCE.
THEY'RE COOL WITH IT.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.421
VAN PELT'S ON IT.
WHEN ARE YOU GETTING OUT?

18:38.421 --> 18:40.641

18:40.641 --> 18:44.775
THANKS.MAN, THEY'RE LETTING ANYBODY
INTO THE HOSPITAL THESE DAYS.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.082
RAY.HEY, TERESA.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.649
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.653
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:52.653 --> 18:54.698
WELL, I HEARD THAT MY FAVORITE
CBI AGENT WAS LAID UP.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.830
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.224
OH. THANKS.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.964
NICE SUIT.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.923
PRIVATE SECTOR'S

19:01.923 --> 19:04.360
YEAH. I DO OKAY.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.276
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

19:07.276 --> 19:10.410
OH, NOTHING. I--
I SCRAPED MY KNEE.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.499
[chuckles] THAT'S NOT
WHAT I HEAR.

19:12.499 --> 19:16.285
I HEAR YOU WERE THIS CLOSE
TO RED JOHN.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.157
THAT'S SOME SCARY STUFF.
YOU OKAY?

19:18.157 --> 19:21.769
FINE. YEAH, IT TURNS OUT
RED JOHN ISN'T SO TOUGH.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.163

LAID A HAND ON ME.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.905

[chuckles]

19:37.132 --> 19:38.829
AM I MAKING YOU NERVOUS
SOMEHOW?

19:38.829 --> 19:40.440
NO. [chuckles]YOU SURE?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.050
'CAUSE YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
I'M MAKING YOU NERVOUS.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.834
NO!

19:43.834 --> 19:46.185
WH-WHY ARE YOU HERE?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.751

19:52.495 --> 19:54.932
CAN'T SAY. SORRY.
WHY DO YOU CARE?

19:54.932 --> 19:57.631
I DON'T CARE.
I HAVE CLIENTS WHO CARE.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.502
VISUALIZE CLIENTS.
WHY DO THEY CARE?

19:59.502 --> 20:02.113
[breathes sharply
and chuckles]

20:02.113 --> 20:03.680
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED THIS WAS
HOW THE CONVERSATION

20:03.680 --> 20:06.030
WAS GONNA GO, BUT...

WE'LL HAVE THE TIME.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.868
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

20:19.392 --> 20:23.178
[whistling
"Jimmy Crack Corn"]

20:23.178 --> 20:26.921
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:30.054 --> 20:32.492
MISS MATHEWS, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE PROSTITUTION CHARGES.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.538
I'M JUST INTERESTED IN WHAT
HAPPENED WITH TITUS STONE.I GET IT.

20:35.538 --> 20:38.628
YOU WORK AS AN ESCORT

20:38.628 --> 20:40.543
PRIVATE COMPANION AGENCY,
IS THAT RIGHT?[clicks pen]

20:40.543 --> 20:43.807
STRICTLY SPEAKING,
I'M A... INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

20:43.807 --> 20:46.288
THAT MEANS THE COMPANY OFFERS
THE SERVICE,

20:46.288 --> 20:48.682
BUT THE TERMS ARE NEGOTIATED
BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND ME.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.598
ALSO, THEY DON'T PAY
WITHHOLDING OR F.I.C.A. TAXES.

20:51.598 --> 20:54.296
AND STONE WAS PAYING
FOR YOU TO SLEEP WITH HIM?

20:54.296 --> 20:55.732
THAT IS WHAT WAS OCCURRING.

20:55.732 --> 20:56.820
HOW LONG
HAD YOU KNOWN STONE?

20:56.820 --> 20:58.474
LIKE, FOUR MONTHS?

20:58.474 --> 21:00.346
HE'D CALL EVERY TWO,
THREE WEEKS.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.912
AND HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE HIM?

21:01.912 --> 21:04.785
QUIET, NOT VERY GOOD
AT TALKING, REALLY.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.221
NOT UNTIL HE GOT INTO
THE ROLE.

21:06.221 --> 21:07.744
THE ROLE?

21:07.744 --> 21:09.659
YEAH, HE'S INTO
ROLE-PLAYING.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.183
OH. AND WHAT ROLE
DID YOU PLAY?

21:12.183 --> 21:16.100
HE'S A SAMURAI WARRIOR,
AND I'M A VILLAGE GIRL

21:16.100 --> 21:18.407
HE JUST SAVED FROM BANDITS.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.584
HE HAD A ROBE AND SANDALS
AND A REAL SAMURAI SWORD.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.934
IT'S CALLED A KATANA.
HE WOULD TALK ABOUT

21:23.934 --> 21:25.675
THE HONORABLE WAY
OF THE WARRIOR,

21:25.675 --> 21:28.243
AND THEN I WOULD BE GRATEFUL
FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.506
[inhales, stops]

21:30.506 --> 21:32.116
WHAT WAS IT? GO ON.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.858
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT HONOR

21:34.858 --> 21:36.512
IN THAT CRAZY ROBE,

21:36.512 --> 21:38.122
IT'S THE ONLY TIME
HE EVER REALLY SEEMED

21:38.122 --> 21:41.387
COMFORTABLE WITH HIMSELF.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.954
YOU SAW HIM THE NIGHT
BEFORE LAST, RIGHT?

21:43.954 --> 21:45.478
MM-HMM.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.957
DID HE TALK ABOUT ANY
ISSUES THAT HE HAD,

21:46.957 --> 21:48.263
PROBLEMS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
IN HIS LIFE?

21:48.263 --> 21:50.134
NO.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.702
HE DID SEEM KIND OF SAD,
THOUGH.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.574
HE PAID
FOR AN EXTRA HALF HOUR.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.272
JUST, YOU KNOW, CUDDLING.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.624
GRACE.BOSS.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.931
THEY LET YOU GO?Y-YEAH. WHAT IS THAT?

22:03.931 --> 22:05.715
A COMPUTER
FROM STONE'S OFFICE.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.891
ANYTHING ON IT?NO, NOTHING.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.893
NO FILES, NO APPLICATIONS.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.939
EVEN THE OPERATING SYSTEM
IS GONE. IT'S BEEN WIPED.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.941
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?RUN A PROGRAM.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.334
BUT YOU HAVE TO RUN IT
FIVE OR SIX TIMES

22:15.334 --> 22:17.161
TO A GET A DISK
THIS CLEAN.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.338
SOMEBODY REALLY WANTED TO GET
RID OF SOMETHING ON THE DRIVE.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.687
THERE ARE FRAGMENTS OF DATA
HERE AND THERE.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.123
I'M TRYING TO PUT THEM
TOGETHER.

22:22.123 --> 22:25.431
KEEP CHECKING,
AND, UM, GRACE...

22:25.431 --> 22:27.824
[lowered voice] THE SURVEILLANCE
ON THE RED JOHN SUSPECTS--

22:27.824 --> 22:30.000
I NEED YOU TO TAKE IT DOWN.[lowered voice] REALLY?

22:30.000 --> 22:33.830
RIGHT AWAY, AS SOON AS YOU CAN.
DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND.SURE. OKAY.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.658
[normal voice]
HAVE YOU SEEN JANE?

22:35.658 --> 22:37.138
[normal voice] NO.
HE CALLED A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

22:37.138 --> 22:38.182
NEEDED AN ADDRESS.WHOSE ADDRESS?

22:38.182 --> 22:39.183
UM...

22:54.242 --> 22:56.897
[cell phone rings]

22:56.897 --> 22:59.116
[sighs]

22:59.116 --> 23:01.945
LISBON. YOU'RE WONDERING
WHO SOPHIE MILLER IS?

23:01.945 --> 23:03.730
She was your psychiatrist.[doorbell rings]

23:03.730 --> 23:05.601
That's right.
I know some things.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.386
WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF HER?

23:07.386 --> 23:09.736
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
DOCTORS, HOSPITALS.

23:09.736 --> 23:13.174
YOU THINK RED JOHN LEARNED
ABOUT EILEEN TURNER FROM HER.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.958
HE MUST HAVE.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.744
I MUST HAVE TOLD HER A LOT
OF THINGS I DON'T REMEMBER.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.876
I WAS ON
SOME SERIOUS MEDICATION.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.661
WELL, CALL ME
AFTER YOU TALK TO HER.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.272
SURE.RIGHT AFTER.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.969
[doorbell rings]BYE.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.593
[click]

24:23.940 --> 24:25.376
[Sophie] THE PATIENT SHOWED

24:25.376 --> 24:27.291
SOME TREATMENT RESPONSE
AT THE SESSION.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.771
HILARY CONTINUES
TO EXHIBIT SIGNS

24:28.771 --> 24:30.599
OF SEPARATION ANXIETY DISORDER.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.471
[clicks button]

24:32.471 --> 24:34.516
[recorder clatters in drawer]

24:58.627 --> 25:00.107
HMM.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.164
OH! OH!

25:14.164 --> 25:17.428
[breathing heavily]

25:23.086 --> 25:25.219
BOSS?

25:25.219 --> 25:28.048
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:28.048 --> 25:29.484
JANE FOUND A DEAD BODY.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.574
IT WAS SOMEBODY HE KNOWS.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.402
RED JOHN KILLED HER.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.317
WHY?

25:36.317 --> 25:39.625
WE THINK HE GOT INFORMATION
FROM HER.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.409
JANE'S TALKING
TO THE LOCAL P.D.

25:41.409 --> 25:43.280
[sighs]

25:45.500 --> 25:47.502
UH, DID YOU GET SOMETHING
OFF STONE'S COMPUTER?

25:47.502 --> 25:49.504
THIS IS THE OTHER THING.

25:49.504 --> 25:52.072
I WAS SHUTTING DOWN
THE SURVEILLANCE LIKE YOU ASKED,

25:52.072 --> 25:53.900
AND I NOTICED SOMETHING.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.380
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT.
IT WAS JUST THERE.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.035
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

26:04.737 --> 26:07.566
AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO HER?

26:07.566 --> 26:10.481
UH, A-ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

26:10.481 --> 26:13.615
[cell phone rings]

26:13.615 --> 26:15.095
EXCUSE ME.

26:16.879 --> 26:20.274
LISBON,
I HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.015
[lowered voice] JANE, I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

26:22.015 --> 26:25.192
THREE OF THE RED JOHN SUSPECTS
ARE HERE TOGETHER RIGHT NOW.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.761
WHO?BERTRAM, SHERIFF McALLISTER,
AND REEDE SMITH.

26:28.761 --> 26:31.024
THEY'RE TALKING OUTSIDE
BERTRAM'S OFFICE.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.375
[speaking inaudibly]

26:38.988 --> 26:40.990
AND WE'LL NEED TO TRACK
THE ARRESTS.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.557
[door opens]

26:42.557 --> 26:44.167
HELLO.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.952
UH, JANE, WHAT YOU DOING?
THIS IS A PRIVATE MEETING.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.693
HOW WAS I TO KNOW?
DOOR WAS CLOSED.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.086
AGENT SMITH.JANE.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.001
SHERIFF McALLISTER.TOM.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.742
TOM.

26:53.742 --> 26:57.093
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU
TOM THEN.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.356
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL, PATRICK?

26:59.356 --> 27:01.924
WELL, AS SOON AS YOU'RE DONE,
I NEED TO TALK WITH YOU.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.144
WELL, WE MAY BE SOME TIME.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.799
WE'RE DISCUSSING A JOINT
ANTI-NARCOTICS EFFORT

27:06.799 --> 27:09.279
BY THE CBI, THE F.B.I,
AND NAPA COUNTY.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.803
A LOT OF METH
IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.195
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT
CLEANED UP.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.544
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.503
UH, CARRY ON DISCUSSING
YOUR EFFORT.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.244
I'LL WAIT.

27:17.244 --> 27:20.203
SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT, JANE?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.684
YOU WANTED TO KNOW
WHENEVER WE MADE PROGRESS

27:22.684 --> 27:24.773
ON THE RED JOHN CASE.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.645
WE'VE MADE PROGRESS.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.777
RED JOHN JUST KILLED THE DOCTOR
WHO TREATED ME

27:28.777 --> 27:30.736
DURING MY NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

27:30.736 --> 27:33.434
MAYBE... YOU AND I SHOULD
DISCUSS THIS ALONE.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.872
WELL, WE'RE ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT
FAMILY HERE, RIGHT?

27:36.872 --> 27:38.831
SOPHIE MILLER. GOOD WOMAN.

27:38.831 --> 27:42.269
HE CHOPPED HER HEAD OFF,
PLACED IT IN HER KITCHEN OVEN.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.792
A GAG, I SUPPOSE.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.533
DEAR GOD.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.623
SO HOW IS THAT PROGRESS?

27:48.623 --> 27:52.018
RED JOHN KILLED SOPHIE MILLER
BECAUSE I'M CLOSING IN ON HIM.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.585
HE'S KILLED TWO PEOPLE
WITHIN DAYS NOW.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.413
HE'S GETTING DESPERATE
AND A LITTLE CRAZY,

27:56.413 --> 27:59.503
AND HE DOESN'T REALIZE, BUT HE'S
MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

27:59.503 --> 28:00.809
THAT'S PROGRESS, RIGHT?

28:00.809 --> 28:03.333
WHAT MISTAKE DID HE MAKE?

28:03.333 --> 28:05.118
I WOULD TELL YOU, BUT I'VE
ALWAYS GOTTEN THE FEELING

28:05.118 --> 28:07.598
THAT THIS ROOM IS BUGGED.

28:07.598 --> 28:09.165
WIRED.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.993
GOOD SEEING YOU ALL.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.172
[door closes]

28:16.172 --> 28:18.174
[whistles]

28:18.174 --> 28:20.263
NOW WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

28:20.263 --> 28:22.831
EXACTLY HOW MUCH
DOES JANE KNOW?

28:22.831 --> 28:25.355
WELL, THAT IS
THE QUESTION, ISN'T IT?

28:25.355 --> 28:26.792
YES, IT IS.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.750
AND IT'S YOUR JOB TO KNOW
THE ANSWER.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.360
I'M DOING MY BEST.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.278
[pigeons cooing]

28:35.278 --> 28:36.976
THANK YOU.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.766
SO DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT
SAYS ONE OF THEM IS RED JOHN?

28:46.333 --> 28:48.465
NO.

28:48.465 --> 28:51.381
[cooing]I'M SORRY ABOUT SOPHIE.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.688
I KNOW SHE HELPED YOU.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.739
DO YOU WANT TO BE ALONE?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.566
LOOK, I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO MY OFFICE.

29:02.566 --> 29:03.829
YOU CAN COME--NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

29:05.439 --> 29:07.702
I'M WAITING.

29:07.702 --> 29:11.532
RED JOHN KILLED SOPHIE
BECAUSE SHE COULD IDENTIFY HIM.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.490
NOW HE COULD HAVE STOLEN
MY RECORDS

29:13.490 --> 29:15.710
WITHOUT EVER SEEING HER.

29:15.710 --> 29:18.234
HE MUST HAVE WANTED TO
MEET HER, TO TALK TO HER.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.932
WHY?WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.848
MAYBE CURIOUS ABOUT SOMEONE
THAT WAS CLOSE TO ME.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.197
BUT HE DID.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.939
HE'S BEEN PLANNING THIS
FOR A WHILE.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.810
PROBABLY WENT TO SEE HER
WEEKS AGO,

29:28.810 --> 29:30.246
OR MAYBE EVEN MONTHS.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.509
WHY NOT KILL HER THEN?
AND WHY KILL HER NOW?

29:32.509 --> 29:34.555
HER DEATH WOULD HAVE
TIPPED ME OFF.

29:34.555 --> 29:38.341
HE WAITED UNTIL HE KNEW THAT
I WOULD TRY TO TRACK HER DOWN.

29:38.341 --> 29:39.821
HE HAD TO HAVE USED
SUBTERFUGE

29:39.821 --> 29:43.129
TO GET IN TO SEE HER.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.695
LIKE PRETEND TO BE
A PATIENT?PROBABLY.

29:46.045 --> 29:48.090
THEN SHE'D HAVE A FILE
ON HIM.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.526
WHAT GOOD WOULD IT BE?

29:49.526 --> 29:51.441
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S GONNA
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.661
NO, BUT SOPHIE HAD
A VERY GOOD EYE FOR PEOPLE.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.925
HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO HIDE EVERYTHING FROM HER.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.971
WE NEED TO GET THAT FILE.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.799
[Lisbon, lowered voice]
THE LOCAL POLICE

30:00.799 --> 30:02.191
WILL LET YOU
INTO MILLER'S HOUSE.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.803
HER APPOINTMENT CALENDAR
SHOULD BE IN HER OFFICE.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.022
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A FIRST-TIME MALE PATIENT

30:07.022 --> 30:08.545
THAT'S BEEN TO SEE HER
ONCE OR TWICE

30:08.545 --> 30:10.286
IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS.GOT IT.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.332
DO NOT TELL ANYONE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

30:12.332 --> 30:14.464
TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE
AND THE G.P.S. IN YOUR CAR.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.901
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO'S WATCHING.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.772
OKAY. IF YOU SAY SO.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.732
[normal voice] WHAT'S UP?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.517
DID YOU FIND SOMETHING
ON STONE'S COMPUTER?

30:23.517 --> 30:25.911
I'LL HAVE SOMETHING SOON.
CHO WANTED ME TO TELL YOU

30:25.911 --> 30:28.174
THAT HE WENT TO TALK TO
A GUY NAMED AARON KALINOSKY.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.393
WORKED FOR MODERN AERODYNAMICS
UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.960
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION THERE?

30:31.960 --> 30:34.963
APPARENTLY HE'S GOT
A LAWSUIT AGAINST TITUS STONE.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.445
AARON KALINOSKY?

30:38.445 --> 30:40.273
UH, JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.536
GIVE IT A RUN.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.973
[whirring]

30:54.983 --> 30:57.943
AGENT CHO, YES?YES.
THAT ONE OF YOUR DESIGNS?

30:57.943 --> 31:00.032
YEAH. IT'S, UH,
SELF-GUIDED.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.816
IT'S SUPPOSED TO WEND ITS WAY
THROUGH THE FOREST

31:01.816 --> 31:03.557
AND RETURN WITHOUT
SMASHING INTO A TREE.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.299
WE'LL SEE IF IT PULLS IT OFF.
THIS ABOUT TITUS STONE?

31:06.299 --> 31:08.301
YES.POOR BASTARD.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.650
THE MAN WAS BRILLIANT.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.130
HEAD AND SHOULDERS
ABOVE THE REST.

31:11.130 --> 31:14.785
DID A SAMURAI KILL HIM?
[chuckles]

31:14.785 --> 31:16.526
SORRY. BAD TASTE.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.572
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE SUING HIM
AND MODERN AERODYNAMICS.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.139
OH, THAT.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.836
I WORKED WITH TITUS, KRIS,
AND ELLIOTT

31:21.836 --> 31:23.707
ON SEVERAL PROJECTS
WHILE I WAS THERE.

31:23.707 --> 31:26.493
WE WERE ARGUING OVER WHO OWNS
ONE OF THE DESIGNS

31:26.493 --> 31:28.321
THEY'RE STILL DEVELOPING,
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.323
NOTHING PERSONAL.DID TITUS STONE
FEEL THAT WAY?

31:30.323 --> 31:31.672
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO ASK HIM.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.892
WERE YOU FRIENDS WITH HIM?[chuckles]

31:33.892 --> 31:35.241
I DON'T KNOW
THAT HE HAD FRIENDS.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.372
WE GOT ALONG.

31:36.372 --> 31:37.678
DID YOU TALK TO HIM
RECENTLY?

31:37.678 --> 31:39.114
UM...

31:39.114 --> 31:40.637
WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

31:40.637 --> 31:43.684
'CAUSE IT'S CONFIDENTIAL,
AND NATIONAL SECURITY,

31:43.684 --> 31:45.033
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.210
HERE.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.738
TRY NOT TO GET ME ARRESTED
FOR SAYING THIS, OKAY?

31:54.738 --> 31:56.915
TITUS CALLED SIX WEEKS AGO.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.612
THERE WAS TROUBLE
WITH THAT SYSTEM

31:58.612 --> 32:00.831
THEY SOLD TO THE MILITARY.THE REDBIRD.

32:00.831 --> 32:03.269
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT
IN AFGHANISTAN.

32:03.269 --> 32:04.748
ONE OF THE REDBIRDS
MISSED A TARGET

32:04.748 --> 32:06.446
AND HIT A CIVILIAN HOME,

32:06.446 --> 32:08.578
AND THERE WERE NINE OR TEN
DEATHS, BIG INVESTIGATION.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.058
TITUS WAS WORRIED

32:10.058 --> 32:11.712
THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM
WITH THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.366
HE WANTED ME TO LOOK
AT THE SPECS WITH HIM.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.803
THEN... HE CALLED BACK
A FEW DAYS LATER.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.023
FALSE ALARM.
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.720
UH... LOOK OUT.
[laughs]

32:19.720 --> 32:20.851
[drone whirring]

32:20.851 --> 32:23.115
SEE? NO HANDS.

32:24.594 --> 32:27.293
NO ONE WILL SAY ANYTHING
OFFICIAL ABOUT THE REDBIRD.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.512
I TALKED TO A GUY I SERVED WITH
WHO'S AT THE PENTAGON NOW.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.123
HE SAID, OFF THE RECORD,

32:31.123 --> 32:33.212
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT
AND AN INVESTIGATION.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.605
APPARENTLY IT CLEARED
MODERN AERODYNAMICS.

32:35.605 --> 32:38.130
THEY THINK THE ACCIDENT WAS
CAUSED BY LOCAL WEATHER.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.306
I GUESS THAT'S WHY STONE
CALLED KALINOSKY OFF.

32:40.306 --> 32:41.872
WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE?

32:41.872 --> 32:44.005
THE TECHS FOUND FRAGMENTS
OF A DRONE LIKE THIS

32:44.005 --> 32:45.702
IN THE WRECKAGE.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.182
IT'S FOR SURVEILLANCE.
NO WEAPONS.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.923
BUT YOU COULD ATTACH
A SMALL EXPLOSIVE TO IT.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.490
IS THAT EASY TO DO?NAH.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.057
HAD TO BE SOMEBODY
WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.841
CO-WORKER?

32:53.841 --> 32:56.278
WITH THE ADDED WEIGHT, THE DRONE
HAS A RANGE OF 4 OR 5 MILES.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.932
I CHECKED
WITH THE OTHER EMPLOYEES.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.456
NO ONE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH
THAT NIGHT TO LAUNCH IT.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.241
YEAH, MIGHT ELLIOTT WINSTON
WAS RIGHT.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.938
SOME ANTI-DRONE GUY DID IT.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.027
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S START OVER.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.637
WHAT DID STONE DO THAT NIGHT?

33:07.637 --> 33:09.465
WELL, HE LEFT HIS HOUSE
ABOUT 6:30.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.119
WENT SOMEWHERE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE.

33:11.119 --> 33:14.383
SHOWED UP AT THE RESTAURANT
8:15. STAYED UNTIL 11:50.

33:14.383 --> 33:16.907
A 3-HOUR DINNER BY HIMSELF?
THAT'S A MEAL.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.692
DID YOU GET ANYTHING
FROM THE COMPUTER?

33:18.692 --> 33:20.302
YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST A STREAM
OF NUMBERS.

33:20.302 --> 33:21.738
I CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF IT.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.436
WELL, FIND SOMEBODY
WHO CAN.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.915
OTHERWISE, WE'RE BACK
TO THE DRONE PEOPLE.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.830
DID WE GET THE AUTOPSY REPORT?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.832
YOUWANT TO LOOK
AT THE AUTOPSY RESULTS?

33:28.832 --> 33:30.399
COME ON.
DON'T BE SO SURPRISED.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.836
DOES IT SAY WHAT STONE
HAD FOR DINNER?

33:32.836 --> 33:35.665
[clicks tongue]
UM... "CONTENTS OF STOMACH."

33:35.665 --> 33:37.493
FRIED CHICKEN,
CHEESEBURGER,

33:37.493 --> 33:39.843
MASHED POTATOES, FRENCH FRIES,
MACARONI AND CHEESE,

33:39.843 --> 33:41.149
APPLE PIE, AND ICE CREAM.

33:41.149 --> 33:42.455
YUCK.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.065
EXCELLENT.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.632
LET'S BRING EVERYONE IN
TOMORROW, WRAP THIS ONE UP.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.677
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?FINISH.

33:47.677 --> 33:51.029
UH, MOVE ON, CONCERN OURSELVES
WITH SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.682
YOU KNOW WHO DID IT?SURE.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.162
TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELVES.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.859
WHERE?

34:07.088 --> 34:09.612
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.354
WHAT IS ALL THIS? IS--
IS THAT AARON KALINOSKY?

34:12.354 --> 34:13.877
AH, WE'LL...WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

34:13.877 --> 34:15.444
LET YOU KNOW IN A MINUTE.
PLEASE, SIT DOWN.

34:15.444 --> 34:16.967
I'M SURE
YOU'RE NERVOUS,

34:16.967 --> 34:18.578
CALLED TO SEE
THE COPPERS AND ALL,

34:18.578 --> 34:20.797
SO, UH, LET ME REASSURE YOU,
WE KNOW NEITHER OF YOU

34:20.797 --> 34:22.799
KILLED TITUS STONE.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.975
I THINK I SPEAK FOR BOTH OF US
WHEN I SAY THAT'S TRUE.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.716
MM-HMM.
DO YOU KNOW WHO DID IT?YES.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.892
HE KILLED HIMSELF.HE WHAT?

34:28.892 --> 34:31.460
HE WAS A SAMURAI, AND HE FELT
HE'D DISHONORED HIMSELF,

34:31.460 --> 34:34.376
SO HE COMMITTED SEPPUKU,
RITUAL SUICIDE,

34:34.376 --> 34:36.204
WITH HIS OWN PARTICULAR SWORD.

34:40.165 --> 34:43.429
[beeping, whirring]

34:54.353 --> 34:56.877
WELL, WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE?[Patrick] HIS DINNER.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.401
CHEESEBURGER, FRIED CHICKEN,

34:59.401 --> 35:03.405
MASHED POTATOES,
MAC AND CHEESE.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.538
COMFORT FOOD.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.235
A CONDEMNED MAN'S LAST MEAL.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.934
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
H-HOW HAD HE DISHONORED HIMSELF?

35:10.934 --> 35:12.806
MISS MAKKENA,
YOU WANNA TELL US?

35:12.806 --> 35:14.721
ME? [chuckles] WHY?

35:14.721 --> 35:16.201
BECAUSE HE TOLD YOU.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.072
UH, NO.

35:18.072 --> 35:21.597
SURE, HE DID.
HE CAME TO YOU TO CONFESS,

35:21.597 --> 35:23.208
BECAUSE HE WAS IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.909
KRIS.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.129
I BROUGHT YOU THIS.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.088
I THOUGHT
I-I WON'T NEED IT ANYMORE.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.394
CAN I COME IN?

35:35.394 --> 35:36.960
UH, YE--SURE.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.441
OKAY, TITUS DIDN'T LOVE ME.SURE, HE DID.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.226
HE HAD A PHOTOGRAPH
OF YOU ON HIS DESK.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.141
HE KEPT IT THERE.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.751
HE ALSO HIRED A HOOKER THAT
LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.492
IT WASN'T HARD TO SEE.

35:46.492 --> 35:50.235
HE CAME BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE
WAS A PROBLEM WITH REDBIRD.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.714
IT'S WHAT LED
TO THOSE DEATHS,

35:51.714 --> 35:53.934
AND YOU THREE
COVERED IT UP.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.328
YOU MADE INVESTIGATORS THINK
IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE,

35:56.328 --> 35:58.591
BUT HE COULDN'T LIVE
WITH THAT.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.767
PEOPLE DIED... OKAY.

36:00.767 --> 36:01.898
BECAUSE WE SCREWED UP. THERE WERE MISTAKES.
WE ALL KNOW IT.

36:01.898 --> 36:04.466
WE LIED! TO EVERYONE!

36:04.466 --> 36:08.601
IT'S NOT...
IT ISN'T HONORABLE.

36:08.601 --> 36:09.950
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.647
LOOK, IT WAS A MOMENT.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.127
OKAY? THAT'S IT.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.129
THE POINT IS
TO COLLECT OURSELVES,

36:15.129 --> 36:17.566
ACT WITH GRACE, AND MOVE ON,
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.481
TITUS, THIS COMPANY--
IT'S GONE.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.266
ME, TOO. I AM DONE.
YOU WILL HAVE RUINED ME.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.834
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO, TITUS?

36:24.834 --> 36:27.272
NO.HE TOLD YOU
WHAT HE WAS GONNA DO,

36:27.272 --> 36:29.796
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY
AND TALK HIM OUT OF IT.[sighs]

36:29.796 --> 36:32.842
THE WAY I FEEL RIGHT NOW,
I CAN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.497
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO

36:35.497 --> 36:38.152
WHATEVER BRINGS YOU PEACE.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.373
WHO KNOWS?
IT COULD BE BEAUTIFUL.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.551
[sighs]

36:45.551 --> 36:48.945
[Lisbon] SO YOU WENT
TO THE OFFICE,

36:48.945 --> 36:50.991
AND YOU FOUND THE SUICIDE NOTE
ON HIS COMPUTER

36:50.991 --> 36:54.299
THAT HE TOLD YOU ABOUT,
AND YOU GOT RID OF IT.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.872
KRIS...LOOK, SHUT UP, ELLIOTT.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.352
IS THIS TRUE?LOOK, EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE--

37:04.352 --> 37:06.572
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT TITUS,
NONE.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.227
EVEN IF IT WERE,
YOU CAN'T PROVE IT.I'M GONNA BE SICK.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.924
LOOK, JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?
I-I-I HAVE--

37:10.924 --> 37:12.491
I HAVE NOTHING TO ANSWER FOR.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.884
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.539
NOT ABOUT THE SUICIDE.
BUT WE CAN PROVE THE COVER-UP.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.062
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?AGENT VAN PELT WAS ABLE

37:19.062 --> 37:22.152
TO RECOVER DOCUMENTS
FROM STONE'S COMPUTER.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.589
THEY'RE JUST NUMBERS TO US,

37:23.589 --> 37:25.504
BUT ACCORDING
TO MR. KALINOSKY,

37:25.504 --> 37:28.333
THEY PROVE THAT THERE WERE FLAWS
IN REDBIRD'S DESIGN.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.726
HE'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW
ABOUT TO GIVE HIS STATEMENT.

37:30.726 --> 37:31.945
NO. MNH-MNH.

37:31.945 --> 37:33.860
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,
FRAUD,

37:33.860 --> 37:36.558
MAYBE EVEN MANSLAUGHTER.

37:36.558 --> 37:39.169
I WIPED THAT DISK.THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A CONFESSION.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.084
[Lisbon] IT DOES,
DOESN'T IT?I'M DONE.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.738
WAIT, WAIT. ELLIOTT, HANG ON.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.131
LOOK, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT IF WE JUST--

37:44.131 --> 37:46.089
IF WE JUST HANG TOGETHER.HANG TOGETHER? HANG--

37:46.089 --> 37:47.569
ARE YOU INSANE?

37:47.569 --> 37:48.831
AFTER WHAT YOU DID
TO TITUS?

37:48.831 --> 37:50.398
JUST DON'T FOCUS
ON THE NEGATIVE.

37:50.398 --> 37:51.791
FOCUS ON THIS.

37:51.791 --> 37:55.098
I'M CALLING MY LAWYER
AND CUTTING A DEAL.

37:55.098 --> 37:58.928
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, KRIS.
GOOD LUCK.

38:02.976 --> 38:05.108
I WIPED THE DISK.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.806
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DID.

38:06.806 --> 38:10.026
MR. KALINOSKY SAID THE DATA
WAS JUST RANDOM NUMBERS.

38:10.026 --> 38:13.247
GIBBERISH.OOPS.

38:13.247 --> 38:14.901
JANE, RIGSBY'S ON THE PHONE.

38:14.901 --> 38:19.079
OH. OKAY. EXCUSE ME.
I'LL TAKE IT IN YOUR OFFICE.

38:22.082 --> 38:25.215
MISS MAKKENA, I CAN'T
ARREST YOU TODAY,

38:25.215 --> 38:27.305
BUT I WILL... SOON.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.616
HOW MANY NAMES?FOUR.

38:34.616 --> 38:38.620
ERNEST MATTHEWSON,
MITCHELL LIVINGSTON WASHBURN,

38:38.620 --> 38:40.927
MIGUEL VAVARIO,
AND JAY ROTH.

38:40.927 --> 38:44.757
ROTH. IT'S FROM THE GERMAN ROT.
MEANS "RED."

38:44.757 --> 38:46.541
WHEN DID SHE SEE HIM?

38:46.541 --> 38:49.109
UH...

38:50.502 --> 38:52.373
ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS
AGO.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.461
DO YOU HAVE THE FILE?

38:53.461 --> 38:55.289
NO. THERE IS NO FILE.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.986
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:56.986 --> 38:58.771
Well, I searched the whole
office. It's not here.

38:58.771 --> 39:00.250
I GOT THE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY
TO CHECK

39:00.250 --> 39:01.730
THE ARCHIVED FILES
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.297
THERE'S NO FILE THERE, EITHER.
IT'S GONE.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.603
HE TOOK IT.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.256
I'M SORRY, JANE.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.346
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, RIGSBY.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.696
WE'LL SEE YOU
WHEN YOU GET BACK.[clicks keypad]

39:10.696 --> 39:13.089
DAMN IT!NOW, NOW.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.701
I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING.
I REALLY DID.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.574
WHY AREN'T YOU MORE UPSET?

39:19.574 --> 39:22.490
WELL, I KIND OF
HALF-EXPECTED IT.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.754
AND I KNOW SOMETHING
THAT RED JOHN DOESN'T.

39:25.754 --> 39:27.930
SOPHIE DICTATED HER NOTES.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.368
SHE COULDN'T TYPE.
NEVER LEARNED.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.761
SHE WAS KIND OF
PROUD OF THE FACT.

39:32.761 --> 39:36.025
SHE HAD A SERVICE THAT
TRANSCRIBED EVERYTHING FOR HER.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.287
DID THEY KEEP A COPY?

39:37.287 --> 39:38.985
VERY POSSIBLY.

39:40.334 --> 39:44.425
[Sophie] PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSTIC
SESSION WITH JAY ROTH.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.732
MR. ROTH CAME IN COMPLAINING
OF A RECENT ISSUE

39:46.732 --> 39:48.908
WITH SEVERE ACROPHOBIA.FEAR OF HEIGHTS.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.866
I KNOW. HE'S MIDDLE-AGED,

39:50.866 --> 39:53.042
IN GOOD HEALTH,
WITH NO STATED PRIOR HISTORY

39:53.042 --> 39:55.436
OF PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.482
HE HAS NO LIVING FAMILY,
BUT MANY FRIENDS

39:57.482 --> 40:01.921
ON WHOM HE RELIES FOR COMPANY
AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT.

40:01.921 --> 40:05.403
HE'S WELL-SPOKEN,
GOOD POSTURE, SELF-POSSESSED.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.579
IN THE WAITING ROOM,
HE SAT CALMLY IN ONE PLACE,

40:07.579 --> 40:10.495
NEEDING NO DISTRACTION.[whistling]

40:10.495 --> 40:12.888
THOUGH I NOTE,
HE IS AN EXCELLENT WHISTLER.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.110
HIS SELF-PRESENTATION
IS PLEASANT,

40:17.110 --> 40:18.764
BUT THERE ARE HINTS
IN HIS BEHAVIOR

40:18.764 --> 40:20.853
OF A DAMAGED
AND NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.942
[speaking inaudibly]

40:22.942 --> 40:24.726
HE SAYS HE DEALS WITH
CONFLICT AND ADVERSITY

40:24.726 --> 40:26.511
EASILY, THOUGH.

40:26.511 --> 40:30.297
I'M NOT CONVINCED HE'S BEING
TRUTHFUL ABOUT THIS.

40:30.297 --> 40:34.606
IN FACT, MUCH OF WHAT HE SAID,
THOUGH SPOKEN CONVINCINGLY,

40:34.606 --> 40:36.303
DID NOT MATCH
WHAT I CAN ONLY CALL

40:36.303 --> 40:39.175
MY INSTINCTIVE RESPONSE
TO HIS PRESENCE,

40:39.175 --> 40:40.742
THOUGH I CANNOT POINT
TO IDENTIFIABLE

40:40.742 --> 40:42.744
CLINICAL BEHAVIORS
THAT INDICATE THIS.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.748
I SENSE SOMETHING DECEPTIVE
AND DARK

40:46.748 --> 40:48.924
IN HIS EMOTIONAL MAKEUP.

40:48.924 --> 40:51.100
HOWEVER, THERE IS
EVERY INDICATION

40:51.100 --> 40:52.798
THAT HIS PHOBIA ISSUES
ARE REAL--

40:52.798 --> 40:54.756
WHETHER ACROPHOBIA
OR SOME OTHER ISSUE

40:54.756 --> 40:57.672
REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

40:57.672 --> 40:59.326
AN INTERESTING CASE.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.069
I LOOK FORWARD
TO FURTHER SESSIONS WITH HIM.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.637
