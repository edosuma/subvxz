It's Evan's. Here we go.

11:37.550 --> 11:39.052
Slow, slow, slow, slow. Slow.

11:39.086 --> 11:41.055
- This is slow.
- Okay.

11:41.088 --> 11:43.156
Wait. Your car is in the shop again?

11:43.189 --> 11:44.691
Yep.

11:47.126 --> 11:48.963
Thank you.

11:52.967 --> 11:56.002
(SIGHS)

11:56.035 --> 11:58.905
Dad, before we go, I need
to ask you something.

11:58.938 --> 12:00.540
Put on my seat belt.

12:00.573 --> 12:02.108
No.

12:02.141 --> 12:03.810
Well, yeah...

12:03.843 --> 12:07.781
but what I really need to ask is,

12:07.814 --> 12:10.651
why the hell did you
disappear like that?

12:13.419 --> 12:15.890
When I asked Newberg to marry me,

12:15.923 --> 12:18.491
I knew two things...

12:18.525 --> 12:20.794
that I loved her

12:20.828 --> 12:23.463
and that I needed heart surgery

12:23.496 --> 12:25.799
and I could die.

12:25.833 --> 12:26.900
That's three things.

12:26.934 --> 12:28.302
Are you gonna nitpick,

12:28.334 --> 12:29.769
or are you gonna let
me finish the story?

12:29.803 --> 12:32.306
Sorry, sorry. Go ahead.

12:32.338 --> 12:34.507
And I didn't want any of you to think

12:34.540 --> 12:38.078
that I asked her to marry me
so that I wouldn't die alone.

12:38.112 --> 12:39.713
Nobody wants to die alone, Dad.

12:39.746 --> 12:41.214
That's why I asked her to marry me.

12:41.247 --> 12:43.150
- Oh.
- And I love her.

12:43.183 --> 12:46.287
- I really do.
- I know you do.

12:46.319 --> 12:49.823
But lying to her...

12:49.857 --> 12:54.095
created so much guilt.

12:54.127 --> 12:56.429
I panicked.

12:56.463 --> 12:57.798
And when I panic...

12:57.831 --> 13:00.067
Yeah, we know.

13:00.099 --> 13:02.235
My therapist almost fired me.

13:02.269 --> 13:04.205
(CHUCKLES)

13:04.237 --> 13:07.107
I'm a schmuck.

- (ENGINE TURNING OVER)

13:13.146 --> 13:16.283
- (SIGHS)
- Any word from Johns Hopkins?

13:16.317 --> 13:19.186
No, but Raj is in Baltimore right now,

13:19.218 --> 13:21.088
looking into job possibilities.

13:21.121 --> 13:24.125
- Oh, that's good.
- No, it's not.

13:24.158 --> 13:27.328
It's more pressure. It's more anxiety.

13:27.361 --> 13:29.096
It's more of me spinning
around in my own head,

13:29.129 --> 13:30.298
wondering if I was an idiot

13:30.331 --> 13:31.799
to pin all of my hopes on one school.

13:31.832 --> 13:34.367
You're not an idiot. You're, uh...
you're aspirational.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.039
Okay. I'm hardheaded or uncompromising.

13:38.072 --> 13:40.441
- That's what my mother would say.
- (CAR ALARM BEEPS)

13:40.473 --> 13:44.011
That if you insist on having it all...

13:44.044 --> 13:46.981
you could end up with nothing.

13:47.014 --> 13:48.549
Maybe if I'd been more socially active

13:48.582 --> 13:49.917
when I was at Johns Hopkins,

13:49.949 --> 13:51.985
my letter of recommendation
would have carried more weight.

13:52.019 --> 13:53.220
Oh, no, no, no.

13:53.252 --> 13:54.588
I'm sure it actually has more to do

13:54.621 --> 13:56.656
with how much money you
give after you graduate.

13:56.689 --> 13:59.559
Right. Probably too late for that now.

14:01.895 --> 14:03.864
Good afternoon, Divya, Dr. Sacani.

14:03.896 --> 14:05.799
I'll see you at tomorrow's
board meeting, yes?

14:05.833 --> 14:07.901
Uh, yes, yes, we'll definitely be there.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.203
Good.

14:10.237 --> 14:13.540
Important matters to discuss.

14:13.573 --> 14:17.178
(ENGINES TURNING OVER)

14:20.146 --> 14:22.349
Well, I bet I know what one
of the important matters is.

14:22.382 --> 14:24.818
Your virosome. Congratulations.

14:24.852 --> 14:27.621
Oh, um, it's hardly news.

14:27.654 --> 14:30.191
Promising, yes, but there's
still a lot of work to be done.

14:30.223 --> 14:31.858
That is not what I heard.

14:31.891 --> 14:34.661
My friend in Berlin told me
about the Phase One trial

14:34.694 --> 14:35.795
that's happening over there,

14:35.828 --> 14:37.298
like, in Latvia or something, right?

14:37.331 --> 14:39.633
Uh, maybe it's someone else's virosome.

14:39.665 --> 14:41.234
Ours isn't ready for trial yet.

14:41.267 --> 14:42.402
Are you sure?

14:42.435 --> 14:44.405
Because they said they
heard it from a KJR exec

14:44.438 --> 14:47.140
who said it was theirs.

14:47.174 --> 14:49.076
Is it possible Boris' company

14:49.108 --> 14:52.445
has more than one
virosome in development?

14:52.478 --> 14:55.583
It's possible, just not likely.

15:01.188 --> 15:03.124
Here we go.

15:03.156 --> 15:05.859
All right, we're gonna sit right here.

15:05.892 --> 15:07.994
Easy, easy, I don't want
to call you Papa Stitch.

15:08.028 --> 15:09.830
- Oh. Oh.
- There you go.

15:09.862 --> 15:12.032
Better. Good.

15:13.132 --> 15:16.203
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:16.236 --> 15:19.039
(SIGHS) Home sweet home.

15:19.073 --> 15:20.841
If you don't mind, I'm going
to spend the rest of the day

15:20.873 --> 15:22.342
right here.

15:22.376 --> 15:24.645
Yeah, I don't mind.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.549
- Dad?
- Hmm?

15:28.582 --> 15:30.785
One last question...

15:30.818 --> 15:35.489
Why Passaic? Why the old house?

15:35.521 --> 15:37.257
It's where your mother got sick.

15:37.290 --> 15:39.727
Yeah, okay, but how'd you know
the owner wouldn't be there?

15:39.760 --> 15:42.630
(CHUCKLES) I knew. I'm the owner.

15:42.663 --> 15:44.799
What?

15:44.832 --> 15:46.900
You've owned that house
this entire time?

15:46.934 --> 15:50.304
Yeah, it was always my plan
to give it to you and Evan.

15:50.337 --> 15:53.640
Then one day Evan said,
"I hated that house."

15:53.674 --> 15:54.909
It made me sad.

15:54.942 --> 15:56.577
Then you guys did so
well for yourselves,

15:56.610 --> 15:59.447
I thought giving you the
house, it's pathetic.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.149
And so it's been sitting
empty for a long time,

16:02.182 --> 16:06.821
and I thought, "This might
be the perfect place to..."

16:06.853 --> 16:09.289
To punish yourself and suffer alone.

16:09.323 --> 16:10.658
Seemed fair.

16:10.690 --> 16:11.958
My turn.

16:11.991 --> 16:14.761
But Mom didn't suffer alone, Dad.

16:14.794 --> 16:17.631
She had me, and she had Evan,

16:17.664 --> 16:21.402
and now you have me and Evan.

16:21.434 --> 16:24.438
But you've got to decide
if you deserve us.

16:34.629 --> 16:36.998
Oh, my God, I love the master suite...

16:37.032 --> 16:38.434
all that beautiful woodwork.

16:38.466 --> 16:39.934
Oh, I restored that myself.

16:39.968 --> 16:41.971
When my Saab broke down in
front of your "for sale" sign,

16:42.003 --> 16:43.872
I thought life had
thrown me a curveball,

16:43.905 --> 16:46.342
but maybe it did me a favor.

16:46.374 --> 16:49.711
Curveballs are like that. Trust me.
I'm an expert.

16:49.744 --> 16:52.147
- Come see the view outside.
- Yeah.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.016
- (SIGHS)
- Wow.

16:55.050 --> 16:57.286
(CHUCKLES) - Feel free to wander.

16:57.319 --> 16:59.588
The property line goes
down to the water.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.690
I'd join you, but my knees
can't take the hills.

17:02.724 --> 17:05.527
Oh. Well, my knees,
my hips, my ankles...

17:05.560 --> 17:06.528
You have a health issue?

17:06.560 --> 17:08.797
Early stages, rheumatoid arthritis.

17:08.829 --> 17:10.464
One of those common diseases

17:10.499 --> 17:12.300
that doctors still
don't know much about.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.334
While it's not my specialty,

17:13.367 --> 17:14.770
I do know they have new treatments

17:14.801 --> 17:16.104
that can ease the progression.

17:16.137 --> 17:19.640
My granny had RA and was pretty
crippled by age 50, so...

17:19.674 --> 17:21.143
it seems wise to move back to Manhattan

17:21.175 --> 17:23.645
where I have an elevator and
my pick of rheumatologists.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.347
Well, I'm sorry to hear
that's why you're selling.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.949
Hopefully not so sorry that
you won't make an offer.

17:27.983 --> 17:29.484
(CHUCKLES)

17:29.518 --> 17:30.953
It is hard to let go of a place

17:30.985 --> 17:33.187
that's been such a huge
part of your life.

17:33.221 --> 17:35.089
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.724
And this house is clearly special.

17:36.757 --> 17:38.459
I mean, I didn't even know I
was looking until I saw it.

17:38.493 --> 17:39.794
I don't have a real-estate agent yet.

17:39.828 --> 17:40.929
- Me neither.
- Oh.

17:40.962 --> 17:43.365
I'm a big DIY fan this year,

17:43.397 --> 17:45.434
and I don't just mean sanding woodwork.

17:45.466 --> 17:48.637
I had no idea what to
ask for this place,

17:48.669 --> 17:52.340
so I went on Zillow,
looked for comps... easy.

17:52.374 --> 17:54.309
Turns out you can do anything
if you're forced to.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.411
God, I wish all my patients
had your attitude.

17:56.445 --> 18:00.115
(CHUCKLES) Well, I wasn't
talking about my health.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.252
The offer has to be approved
by my soon-to-be ex-husband.

18:03.284 --> 18:04.753
Ah.

18:04.785 --> 18:07.255
I'm beginning to understand
your expertise in curveballs.

18:07.289 --> 18:08.824
Not that he won't accept the offer.

18:08.857 --> 18:11.593
It's just, he's traveling, so it
may take a while to reach him,

18:11.626 --> 18:13.128
but it's a friendly divorce.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.563
Oh, I hear that's the best
kind, if you can pull it off.

18:15.597 --> 18:18.000
24 years with your childhood sweetheart

18:18.032 --> 18:19.368
should count for something.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.770
- Yeah.
- But, you know, we grew apart.

18:22.803 --> 18:25.506
To be honest, he grew apart.

18:25.540 --> 18:27.376
So I decided to move out here

18:27.408 --> 18:30.178
and devote myself to
turning our summer house

18:30.212 --> 18:31.747
into a fresh start for me.

18:31.780 --> 18:34.715
Uh-huh. And then you became symptomatic.

18:34.749 --> 18:36.785
Please don't mention
anything about my health

18:36.818 --> 18:38.387
if you have occasion to
speak to my husband.

18:38.419 --> 18:40.755
He doesn't know why you're selling?

18:40.789 --> 18:42.224
I don't want him to feel like

18:42.256 --> 18:43.958
he has to come and take
care of me, you know.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.395
He was unhappy. He should be happy.

18:46.427 --> 18:48.830
I think he's even found someone new.

18:48.864 --> 18:50.232
He deserves a new life.

18:50.264 --> 18:51.566
And how about you?

18:51.599 --> 18:54.136
Mm, we'll see. (CHUCKLES)

18:54.168 --> 18:57.238
Wow. I'm impressed by
how nice and civilized

18:57.272 --> 18:58.307
and modern you are.

18:58.339 --> 19:00.541
Oh, no. I am totally old-fashioned.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.076
- I follow my heart.
- Oh.

19:02.109 --> 19:04.646
Which is why I hope you make an offer.

19:04.678 --> 19:06.114
I have a good feeling about you.

19:06.147 --> 19:07.683
Mm.

19:07.715 --> 19:09.083
- So go, look around.
- Yeah.

19:09.117 --> 19:10.686
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

19:10.718 --> 19:11.886
(GIGGLES)

19:14.022 --> 19:16.524
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:16.558 --> 19:19.361
I'm so glad you're free
for dinner tonight.

19:19.394 --> 19:21.363
(SIGHS) Why, are you starving?

19:21.396 --> 19:24.500
No, I just feel like
we should be together.

19:24.532 --> 19:27.002
I know.

19:27.034 --> 19:28.669
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, I am.

19:28.703 --> 19:31.473
The sedation wore off
like they said it would.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.775
It's just so wild to think
that sometime soon,

19:34.809 --> 19:38.113
some of your sperm are going
to meet some of my eggs.

19:38.146 --> 19:41.884
I know. I know. I hope they hit it off.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.886
Oh, of course they will.

19:43.918 --> 19:45.954
I just wish we could be part of it.

19:45.986 --> 19:47.989
So where should we go for dinner?

19:50.157 --> 19:52.327
We're not going to dinner.

19:52.359 --> 19:56.497
I really can't allow you
in a sterile environment.

19:56.531 --> 19:58.133
Yeah, we know it's sterile.
That's why we're gowning up.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.702
Still, without a doctor's
approval, I just...

20:00.734 --> 20:02.704
Look, I'm the administrator

20:02.736 --> 20:04.540
visiting one of my
hospital's departments

20:04.572 --> 20:06.742
in order to better
understand their needs

20:06.774 --> 20:11.112
and to determine their future
budget allocations, so...

20:12.446 --> 20:15.082
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

20:15.116 --> 20:17.186
Nice.

20:18.520 --> 20:22.558
I've identified seven of
the most robust sperm,

20:22.590 --> 20:25.327
the first of which I
will now inject directly

20:25.359 --> 20:29.263
into the center of an egg.

20:29.297 --> 20:31.266
There he is.

20:31.299 --> 20:34.537
- Yeah.
- You can see him.

20:39.107 --> 20:42.110
Oh, did... just gonna...

20:45.580 --> 20:47.582
BOTH: Wow.

20:57.291 --> 21:00.295
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

21:08.669 --> 21:10.772
Felicity? Are you home?

21:10.804 --> 21:12.974
Hank, I'm here.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.809
I'm sorry. Did you ring?

21:14.842 --> 21:17.044
Uh, yeah, I did.

21:17.078 --> 21:19.982
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm a little warm.

21:20.014 --> 21:22.016
My knee is acting up,

21:22.050 --> 21:24.552
but if that contract even comes
close to my asking price,

21:24.586 --> 21:25.587
I think I'll recover.

21:25.619 --> 21:29.358
- (CHUCKLES) May I feel?
- Sure.

21:30.558 --> 21:33.395
Oh. Would you mind a quick exam?

21:33.427 --> 21:34.495
Mm-mm.

21:37.866 --> 21:40.301
Okay.

21:40.334 --> 21:43.638
That should ease the pain.

21:43.672 --> 21:46.341
I'll have the lab run
tests on this fluid,

21:46.374 --> 21:48.410
but I'm a little puzzled.

21:48.443 --> 21:50.612
Fever is not a hallmark of RA.

21:50.645 --> 21:52.147
Have you had any other symptoms?

21:52.179 --> 21:55.149
Uh, a little fatigue, nausea.

21:55.183 --> 21:57.051
And the swollen lymph nodes.

21:57.084 --> 21:59.520
Oh, yeah, and a rash on my legs.

21:59.553 --> 22:00.955
I'm falling apart.

22:00.989 --> 22:03.625
Hmm. Tell me more about your diagnosis.

22:03.657 --> 22:05.426
You said you're still at an early stage?

22:05.459 --> 22:09.463
Yeah, as my GP explained, it
was a diagnosis of exclusion

22:09.496 --> 22:12.400
and too early for the factor
to be detected in my blood.

22:12.434 --> 22:15.803
Okay, let's have a look.

22:15.837 --> 22:18.607
Um, can you feel that?

22:18.639 --> 22:19.675
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

22:19.707 --> 22:21.643
Now with your eyes closed.

22:23.712 --> 22:25.647
But everything else was ruled out,

22:25.679 --> 22:29.317
and since my granny had RA,
it seems the likely culprit.

22:29.350 --> 22:30.484
Yeah, except that, like you said,

22:30.518 --> 22:32.154
there's a lot science doesn't know,

22:32.186 --> 22:34.121
and while there can be
a genetic propensity,

22:34.155 --> 22:36.925
RA isn't considered hereditary.

22:36.957 --> 22:40.161
You have some decreased
sensation in your lower legs.

22:40.195 --> 22:41.495
How's your appetite?

22:41.529 --> 22:42.964
- Mm.
- Okay.

22:42.996 --> 22:44.666
Did your joint pain
begin around the time

22:44.698 --> 22:46.600
you started woodworking?

22:46.634 --> 22:48.837
Yes. Why does that matter?

22:48.869 --> 22:51.272
Your fever might be the
sign of a simple infection,

22:51.305 --> 22:53.574
but in an old house like
this, there could be toxins

22:53.608 --> 22:55.010
that might account for your fever,

22:55.042 --> 22:57.111
as well as your joint
pain and neuropathy.

22:57.145 --> 22:59.181
- Like what?
- Arsenic maybe.

22:59.214 --> 23:01.750
It was used in the past to treat wood.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.284
So are you telling me

23:03.318 --> 23:05.287
that I don't have rheumatoid arthritis

23:05.320 --> 23:09.023
or that I do have it and
some other disease?

23:09.057 --> 23:11.293
Let's find out.

23:11.326 --> 23:13.295
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.966
And good.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.868
That brings us to a bit of housekeeping

23:20.901 --> 23:23.371
before I turn the meeting over.

23:23.405 --> 23:24.473
If...

23:24.505 --> 23:27.809
Ah, Hank.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.378
So glad you could join us.

23:29.410 --> 23:30.978
Sorry.

23:31.012 --> 23:32.280
As I was saying,

23:32.312 --> 23:34.983
as Mr. Lawson, Evan R,

23:35.015 --> 23:38.285
has now admirably completed
six months as administrator,

23:38.319 --> 23:42.257
it seems prudent to move that
he be assigned my proxy vote

23:42.290 --> 23:44.091
in the event of my absence.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.993
Any objections?

23:48.396 --> 23:51.099
- Motion carries.
- Excellent.

23:51.131 --> 23:53.935
I'll turn the meeting over,
as I have other obligations.

23:53.967 --> 23:56.204
I have a question.

23:56.236 --> 23:59.106
Perhaps Mr. Lawson can address them.

23:59.139 --> 24:00.408
It's a question for you.

24:00.442 --> 24:02.844
Is KJR Pharmaceuticals
conducting a Phase One trial

24:02.877 --> 24:07.249
of my virosome on patients in Latvia?

24:07.282 --> 24:09.650
That is not a matter for
the board to consider.

24:09.684 --> 24:12.887
Well, if research generated by
our Rare and Orphan Diseases Lab

24:12.920 --> 24:15.389
is being improperly rushed
forward without the knowledge

24:15.423 --> 24:17.526
of the lead investigator into
a third-world environment

24:17.559 --> 24:19.628
in order to skirt safety regulations,

24:19.660 --> 24:21.796
then the board should be made aware.

24:21.830 --> 24:23.130
And if that were the case, Dr. Sacani,

24:23.164 --> 24:24.566
such discussion would be merited.

24:24.599 --> 24:25.766
Since it is not...

24:25.800 --> 24:27.269
Are you denying that
my virosome research

24:27.301 --> 24:30.805
is the basis for a trial
in Eastern Europe?

24:30.839 --> 24:32.640
- Because I made some calls...
- The trial was accelerated

24:32.674 --> 24:34.475
for reasons inappropriate
to discuss here.

24:34.509 --> 24:35.977
There are factors of
which you are not aware.

24:36.010 --> 24:38.379
There are factors of
which you are not aware,

24:38.413 --> 24:40.949
such as a basic understanding
of microbiology

24:40.982 --> 24:43.685
and the potential cataclysmic
immunological response

24:43.717 --> 24:45.419
engendered by the invasive presence

24:45.453 --> 24:49.023
of an untested virosome
in a human environment.

24:57.298 --> 25:00.068
(DOOR SLAMS)

25:00.100 --> 25:02.103
Well... (STAMMERING)

25:06.640 --> 25:08.310
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:13.281 --> 25:15.416
Meeting adjourned.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.852
You know, I've been
sitting here thinking

25:24.884 --> 25:27.437
about how much we all take for granted.

25:27.649 --> 25:28.851
You mean family.

25:28.883 --> 25:31.187
No, I was thinking about
the ability to urinate.

25:31.219 --> 25:32.956
- Oh.
- Yes, family.

25:32.988 --> 25:34.356
Come here.

25:34.390 --> 25:36.292
(THERMOMETER BEEPING)

25:36.324 --> 25:38.393
You're doing a lot better. Lean forward.

25:38.427 --> 25:40.362
Can I tell you... last
night was the first time

25:40.396 --> 25:42.932
I could sleep lying flat.

25:42.965 --> 25:44.434
Deep breath in and out.

25:44.466 --> 25:48.004
Yep, that's your repaired
heart valve. Again.

25:48.036 --> 25:50.472
See, you don't have fluid
pooling in your lungs anymore.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.742
Yeah. That's not the only
thing clear, I'll tell you.

25:52.774 --> 25:53.942
You mean your conscience.

25:53.976 --> 25:55.878
No, again, I was talking urination.

25:55.910 --> 25:58.014
Yes, my conscience.

25:58.046 --> 25:59.481
I saw Newberg this morning.

25:59.515 --> 26:00.649
And how'd that go?

26:00.682 --> 26:02.617
Oh, she gave me quite a tongue-lashing.

26:02.650 --> 26:03.619
Please be a metaphor.

26:03.651 --> 26:05.120
Then I had to get on my knees.

26:05.153 --> 26:06.188
Oh, God.

26:06.222 --> 26:08.224
- She rode me pretty hard.
- Uh-huh.

26:08.256 --> 26:09.491
- Nearly came to blows.
- Dad.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.060
But once she took the whole thing in...

26:11.092 --> 26:12.527
Right.

26:12.561 --> 26:14.864
- I was forgiven.
- Ah, good.

26:14.897 --> 26:18.167
- She was pretty satisfied.
- Okay, Dad, I get the picture.

26:18.199 --> 26:19.736
How about the wedding?

26:19.768 --> 26:23.505
Oh, it's back on, except now
we want to do it "her way."

26:23.538 --> 26:25.073
With a bride and a groom?

26:25.107 --> 26:27.010
Oh, no, much more of a spectacle...

26:27.043 --> 26:30.213
fountains and white
tigers and fireworks,

26:30.245 --> 26:31.214
all the important things.

26:31.246 --> 26:33.149
(LAUGHS) I can't wait.

26:33.181 --> 26:34.883
Yeah, me either.

26:34.917 --> 26:38.588
Now all I got to do is clear
things up with Evan and Paige.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.989
Uh-huh.

26:41.023 --> 26:43.760
Uh, Dad, they... they have a lot
going on right now, you know.

26:43.793 --> 26:45.293
Oh, right now I'm taking a nap.

26:45.326 --> 26:46.294
Oh, good.

26:46.328 --> 26:47.997
But you think it's possible

26:48.030 --> 26:50.266
that I can square it with
Evan and Paige, right?

26:50.299 --> 26:51.734
Yeah, if you find the right moment.

26:51.766 --> 26:53.535
What you don't want to do is
just show up without warning.

26:53.569 --> 26:55.505
- No.
- But you'll figure it out.

26:55.537 --> 26:57.039
- You always do.
- Thank you.

26:57.072 --> 26:58.774
Okay.

27:02.878 --> 27:04.380
So you believe the
trial of your virosome

27:04.412 --> 27:06.082
is being conducted in Eastern Europe

27:06.114 --> 27:07.983
in order to avoid FDA regulations?

27:08.016 --> 27:08.734
Yes.

27:08.773 --> 27:10.441
I can assure you it is not, Doctor.

27:10.474 --> 27:13.444
The trial parameters conform
fully to FDA standards

27:13.477 --> 27:15.379
for an IND application.

27:15.413 --> 27:18.916
Then why exclude me? And why Latvia?
Why the rush?

27:18.950 --> 27:21.153
Would those be your only questions?

27:21.185 --> 27:22.788
No, I have a few more.

27:22.820 --> 27:26.190
Yes, and that is why I excluded you.

27:26.223 --> 27:30.028
With my company for sale,
there was no time for debate.

27:30.060 --> 27:32.097
You're selling KJR Pharmaceuticals?

27:32.129 --> 27:33.531
Indeed. Privately.

27:33.565 --> 27:35.734
So, please, keep the
information confidential.

27:35.767 --> 27:37.369
Okay, but I still have...

27:37.402 --> 27:41.173
If I were to sell with no
Phase One trial completed,

27:41.205 --> 27:43.942
the purchaser would be
acquiring only your research.

27:43.974 --> 27:47.044
A clinical trial takes care of that.

27:47.078 --> 27:49.714
It gives KJR a tangible product

27:49.748 --> 27:51.283
and you quite a handsome royalty.

27:51.316 --> 27:55.154
Yes, but you excluded me.

27:55.186 --> 27:57.655
And I have no need for
greater personal wealth.

27:57.688 --> 28:01.325
Jeremiah, the benefits
in this case for you

28:01.358 --> 28:04.329
would not only be financial.

28:04.361 --> 28:06.230
Should your virosome prove successful,

28:06.263 --> 28:07.366
your name will be placed

28:07.398 --> 28:09.967
alongside some of the great names...

28:10.001 --> 28:13.405
Ehrlich, Pasteur.

28:13.437 --> 28:15.040
As flattering as that would be,

28:15.072 --> 28:16.908
my work isn't about
my reputation either.

28:16.942 --> 28:18.277
What is it about, then?

28:18.309 --> 28:21.213
Advancing the human condition
through scientific knowledge.

28:23.615 --> 28:25.651
Your perspective is admirable.

28:25.684 --> 28:27.418
I hope whoever acquires my company

28:27.452 --> 28:30.556
recognizes the asset they have in you...

28:30.588 --> 28:33.992
assuming, that is, you wish to remain.

28:48.572 --> 28:51.542
Hey, Evan, I have...

28:51.576 --> 28:53.212
Are you okay?

28:53.244 --> 28:55.613
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

28:55.646 --> 28:59.150
Sorry. Hank's just updating
me on Dad's condition.

28:59.184 --> 29:00.285
And?

29:00.318 --> 29:02.887
He will live to exasperate another day.

29:02.921 --> 29:04.155
Well, that's a relief.

29:04.188 --> 29:06.891
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

29:06.925 --> 29:08.393
What's up with you?

29:08.425 --> 29:12.496
Well, I saw the embryologist,
and five are developing.

29:12.530 --> 29:14.800
- Five eggs?
- Five embryos.

29:14.832 --> 29:16.200
But we started with seven.
What happened?

29:16.233 --> 29:18.403
Well, some of them didn't
progress normally,

29:18.435 --> 29:20.038
but it's expected.

29:20.070 --> 29:23.007
Oh. Well, great. I'm
sure they'll catch up.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.176
I had to repeat kindergarten,
so I understand.

29:25.210 --> 29:27.846
This is a little different.

29:27.878 --> 29:30.915
This is like if seven yous
got sent to kindergarten

29:30.948 --> 29:33.252
because they knew most of
you wouldn't survive it.

29:33.284 --> 29:35.786
I know. You're saying they
can't all be winners.

29:35.819 --> 29:38.123
Yeah, and we wouldn't want them to be.

29:38.155 --> 29:41.926
Right. Or else we'd have seven
kids and a reality show.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.062
And we do not need that. We are busy.

29:44.095 --> 29:45.931
Yeah.

29:45.963 --> 29:48.599
I just want two.

29:48.633 --> 29:50.469
Two would be good.

29:53.305 --> 29:56.208
I hope some of them make it.

29:56.241 --> 30:00.511
Don't worry. It's just kindergarten.

30:00.544 --> 30:01.779
Hmm.

30:09.620 --> 30:11.555
Are you working or house hunting?

30:11.588 --> 30:12.790
Both sort of.

30:12.823 --> 30:15.426
Um, I think I found the perfect place.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.728
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.

30:16.761 --> 30:19.364
Okay.

30:19.396 --> 30:20.898
Check it out.

30:20.932 --> 30:22.601
Ooh, look at you Zillowing.

30:22.634 --> 30:24.435
- That's right.
- (CHUCKLES)

30:24.469 --> 30:26.171
Oh, it's gorgeous.

30:26.204 --> 30:28.173
It may be a little big
for me at the moment,

30:28.205 --> 30:30.775
but I could see myself settling
there and growing into it.

30:30.809 --> 30:34.846
Okay, so why were you making
your angry face when I came in?

30:34.878 --> 30:37.081
- My angry face?
- Yeah.

30:37.115 --> 30:38.517
Mm.

30:38.550 --> 30:40.752
That's not my angry face.
That's my thinking face.

30:40.784 --> 30:43.088
Ah. If you say so.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.424
The owner is selling because
she's got rheumatoid arthritis,

30:45.456 --> 30:46.857
or so she thinks.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.993
Oh, now I see where
we're going with this.

30:49.027 --> 30:50.495
What are her symptoms?

30:50.528 --> 30:54.132
Debilitating pain in multiple
large joints, fatigue, fever,

30:54.165 --> 30:56.300
and a mild maculopapular
rash on her legs.

30:56.334 --> 30:58.270
- What are her glucose levels?
- Normal.

30:58.302 --> 31:01.106
So it's not diabetes-related.
How about gout?

31:01.138 --> 31:03.507
- Negative for gout.
- Lyme disease?

31:03.540 --> 31:05.377
Negative for that and
antinuclear antibodies

31:05.409 --> 31:07.011
and rheumatoid factor.

31:07.044 --> 31:10.214
Memingococcemia? Parvovirus?

31:10.248 --> 31:12.184
She's not that sick, and all
of her cultures are normal.

31:12.216 --> 31:13.684
I even tested for arsenic poisoning.

31:13.717 --> 31:16.287
Mm, so it could be anything,
except right now it's nothing.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.124
Exactly.

31:19.156 --> 31:21.893
Wait a second. Say that again.

31:21.925 --> 31:25.364
Uh, it could be anything,
except right now it's nothing.

31:25.396 --> 31:29.400
Oh, my God. The Great Imitator.

31:29.434 --> 31:30.903
Ah.

31:33.838 --> 31:36.508
- (SIGHS) Felicity...
- Yeah.

31:36.540 --> 31:38.877
I don't think you have RA.

31:38.909 --> 31:40.644
Okay. Why?

31:40.677 --> 31:43.247
Well, I'm still waiting on some
tests to confirm my hunch,

31:43.280 --> 31:44.849
but can I see your palms?

31:47.585 --> 31:49.621
Okay, good. No rash.

31:49.654 --> 31:51.823
Um, how about the soles of your feet?

31:51.856 --> 31:53.058
(LAUGHS)

31:53.090 --> 31:55.026
Please.

32:00.464 --> 32:03.201
Yep. There it is.

32:03.233 --> 32:04.735
Are you sexually active?

32:04.769 --> 32:06.070
- No.
- Okay.

32:06.104 --> 32:08.006
Not since I split with my husband.

32:08.039 --> 32:10.275
And was he your only recent partner?

32:10.308 --> 32:13.278
He was my only partner ever.

32:13.310 --> 32:14.378
Oh.

32:14.412 --> 32:17.749
I told you I was old-fashioned. Why?

32:17.781 --> 32:19.583
Because your rash suggests
you might also have

32:19.618 --> 32:22.088
a very old-fashioned disease...

32:22.120 --> 32:23.822
syphilis.

32:26.523 --> 32:28.426
Oh.

32:34.616 --> 32:36.918
- That's great news.
- Did you hear what I just said?

32:36.951 --> 32:38.788
That Raj got the job in Baltimore.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.288
But she's still wait-listed.

32:40.322 --> 32:42.091
Which means we'll be moving to Baltimore

32:42.124 --> 32:44.256
whether I get into Johns Hopkins or not.

32:44.281 --> 32:46.906
Oh, that's fine. If you don't get in,
you can just reapply, like Rudy.

32:47.110 --> 32:47.890
Who's Rudy?

32:48.031 --> 32:50.040
Rudy Ruettiger. They
made a movie about him.

32:50.075 --> 32:51.442
You've never seen "Rudy"?

32:51.476 --> 32:53.679
Okay, so this guy wanted to play
football for Notre Dame so badly

32:53.711 --> 32:56.981
that he moved there,
worked as a groundskeeper,

32:57.015 --> 32:58.617
and kept applying till he got in.

32:58.650 --> 33:00.252
After how long?

33:00.285 --> 33:02.086
- Four years.
- Terrific.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.022
It will not take you that long.

33:04.055 --> 33:05.758
Any day now, you could hear good news.

33:05.790 --> 33:07.625
Actually, so could we.

33:07.659 --> 33:10.395
Really? IVF is moving forward?

33:10.428 --> 33:12.831
We could have embryo transfer
as early as tomorrow.

33:12.864 --> 33:15.267
At last count, there were still
three developing blastocysts.

33:15.299 --> 33:18.136
Do we have to call them that?
It makes them sound dangerous.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.138
- Good morning.
- Hi.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.440
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

33:21.472 --> 33:23.474
So... How'd it go?

33:23.508 --> 33:24.809
How did what go?

33:24.843 --> 33:26.411
Did you apologize to Boris?

33:26.443 --> 33:28.046
I'm assuming you fell on his mercy

33:28.078 --> 33:29.714
since you still have
all your appendages.

33:29.748 --> 33:33.352
Actually, we both recognized
that apologies were unnecessary.

33:33.384 --> 33:36.254
Well, I'm relieved at least
that you didn't lose your job.

33:36.287 --> 33:39.892
No, I didn't, um, but...

33:39.924 --> 33:41.259
I may be starting my own lab.

33:41.293 --> 33:42.394
- Oh.
- What?

33:42.427 --> 33:43.529
Yeah, I've been contemplating it.

33:43.562 --> 33:44.563
That's huge.

33:44.595 --> 33:46.540
Does that mean you'll leave HankMed?

33:46.735 --> 33:49.505
No, I think patient
contact is good for me.

33:49.539 --> 33:50.539
Wow.

33:50.574 --> 33:53.711
Your own lab... that sounds impressive.

33:53.743 --> 33:54.845
And expensive.

33:54.877 --> 33:56.347
Well, I may be coming in to some money,

33:56.379 --> 33:57.714
but I can't discuss it now.

33:57.748 --> 34:00.784
It sounds like everyone has
changes on the horizon.

34:00.817 --> 34:03.654
Paige and Evan... they're
hoping for an embryo transfer.

34:03.686 --> 34:06.190
Oh, and I may be working
as a groundskeeper.

34:06.222 --> 34:07.324
Sorry. A groundskeeper?

34:07.357 --> 34:09.025
We should really go out
and celebrate tonight.

34:09.058 --> 34:10.460
Tomorrow you could be joining Divs

34:10.494 --> 34:11.661
in the sparkling-cider club.

34:11.695 --> 34:14.565
So we should stay in and celebrate.

34:14.597 --> 34:17.201
- No, we should...
- (LAUGHS)

34:17.233 --> 34:21.038
(LAUGHS) I don't get it.

34:21.070 --> 34:22.839
They're sharing an
innuendo based on the fact

34:22.873 --> 34:25.175
that after the viable embryos
are implanted tomorrow,

34:25.208 --> 34:29.280
you'll have to avoid the uterine
spasms caused by coitus.

34:30.947 --> 34:34.684
It's your last night to
have sex with your wife.

34:34.717 --> 34:36.020
Right.

34:36.052 --> 34:38.087
- We should stay in.
- Mm-hmm.

34:38.121 --> 34:39.590
(GIGGLES)

34:41.791 --> 34:44.561
- And here it is.
- Oh.

34:44.592 --> 34:46.562
So this one injection will
cure all my symptoms?

34:46.596 --> 34:48.331
Yes, it will.

34:48.362 --> 34:51.568
Even my gullibility and
my chronic naiveté?

34:51.601 --> 34:52.569
I would never cure someone

34:52.601 --> 34:55.370
of her most endearing characteristics.

34:55.404 --> 34:56.973
You're going to feel a
pinch and then a burning.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.342
Okay.

34:58.375 --> 35:00.945
Okay, here's the pinch, and
now it's going to burn.

35:00.978 --> 35:02.313
(INHALES SHARPLY)

35:02.346 --> 35:03.713
- Okay, all done.
- Ow.

35:03.745 --> 35:06.848
You just hold on to that.

35:06.882 --> 35:09.552
So you'll need follow-up
testing at 3, 6, and 12 months

35:09.584 --> 35:12.254
to confirm that the syphilis has
been completely eradicated.

35:12.288 --> 35:14.958
Plenty of time for me to
reassess my happy marriage.

35:14.991 --> 35:16.459
You spoke to your husband?

35:16.492 --> 35:18.728
He admitted to quite a history.

35:18.762 --> 35:21.131
He wanted to give a full confession,

35:21.163 --> 35:22.765
but at a certain point,
I had to just hang up.

35:22.799 --> 35:25.436
Hey, you're busy. You got
a new life to start.

35:25.469 --> 35:28.706
And my divorce lawyer was on hold.

35:28.739 --> 35:30.107
It's gonna take some time,

35:30.139 --> 35:32.175
but I'm starting to realize
that this curveball

35:32.208 --> 35:33.444
has a silver lining.

35:33.476 --> 35:35.578
That is one very special curveball.

35:35.612 --> 35:37.815
(CHUCKLES) I have my health,
and I have my home.

35:37.847 --> 35:39.315
Yeah, rub it in.

35:39.349 --> 35:41.151
I'm sorry it's not for sale any longer.

35:41.183 --> 35:44.654
Well, I can't think of anyone
I'd rather lose a house to.

35:44.688 --> 35:46.958
(CHUCKLES)

35:49.326 --> 35:52.295
Yep, turns out house hunting
is as challenging as dating.

35:52.329 --> 35:53.597
Well, I hope not.

35:53.630 --> 35:55.799
I don't want my son to
be single and homeless.

35:55.831 --> 35:57.600
I'll try to avoid that for your sake,

35:57.634 --> 36:00.103
but, yeah, houses are tricky.

36:00.137 --> 36:02.339
I was so sure this one was meant to be.

36:02.371 --> 36:03.473
You should have seen...

36:03.507 --> 36:05.809
first time we saw the Passaic house,

36:05.842 --> 36:07.277
it needed a lot of work.

36:07.309 --> 36:10.014
Your mother walked in, fell in
love with the potbelly stove.

36:10.047 --> 36:11.815
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember
how much she loved that thing.

36:11.847 --> 36:14.250
Her eyes lit up like it was
Christmas, and I thought,

36:14.284 --> 36:17.521
"Okay, yes, this is the place
to bring up our sons."

36:17.554 --> 36:18.822
Right.

36:18.855 --> 36:20.257
Now it stands empty,

36:20.290 --> 36:23.494
reminding me of everything
I didn't live up to.

36:23.527 --> 36:26.597
Dad... maybe it's time
to sell that house.

36:26.630 --> 36:29.099
- Hmm.
- Let it go.

36:29.132 --> 36:31.001
- Henry!
- (DOOR CLOSES)

36:31.034 --> 36:34.003
You here?

36:34.036 --> 36:37.073
Evan! Hey, what a surprise.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.074
I drop by like this all the time.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.076
I know. No, I know.

36:39.108 --> 36:40.244
I just thought you and Paige

36:40.277 --> 36:41.578
would be otherwise occupied tonight.

36:41.610 --> 36:43.646
Isn't tomorrow another big day?

36:43.679 --> 36:46.116
It is, yeah. She turned
in early, though.

36:46.148 --> 36:48.251
I guess I was restless.

36:48.284 --> 36:50.920
Um, thank you so much for
texting all those Dad updates

36:50.954 --> 36:52.222
I said I did not want.

36:52.255 --> 36:54.090
Oh, well, I just thought
you might be curious.

36:54.123 --> 36:55.224
And if you are...

36:55.257 --> 36:57.261
That last one was a joke, right...

36:57.293 --> 36:58.929
that he and Ms. Newberg are
planning another wedding?

36:58.962 --> 37:00.730
Not a joke, and Ev...

37:00.764 --> 37:03.400
Oh, my God. I can't believe him.

37:03.433 --> 37:05.201
Is he even well enough to do that?

37:05.235 --> 37:08.105
Sounds like you're worried.

37:08.137 --> 37:09.139
He's my father.

37:09.172 --> 37:10.940
Of course I'm a little worried, but...

37:10.974 --> 37:13.444
Well, that's nice to hear.

37:17.681 --> 37:18.782
This you didn't text?

37:18.815 --> 37:21.284
Look, Dad still needs to
be under observation,

37:21.317 --> 37:22.852
but his infection is clearing up,

37:22.886 --> 37:24.922
and his heart valve is in
better shape than ever.

37:24.954 --> 37:26.389
That's good.

37:26.422 --> 37:28.257
So there's nothing physically
wrong with his heart.

37:28.291 --> 37:30.561
- Ev...
- No, no, no, no.

37:30.594 --> 37:35.532
He's right. I had a major
dishonesty relapse.

37:35.565 --> 37:37.967
Evan, I am ashamed.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.672
I'm ashamed that I let the
old me burst through.

37:42.706 --> 37:44.742
Pretty sure the old you
is the only you, Dad.

37:44.775 --> 37:46.844
Okay, look, this time Dad was
trying to not be a flake,

37:46.876 --> 37:48.411
not to mislead us.

37:48.445 --> 37:50.581
Except I handled it badly,

37:50.614 --> 37:53.516
and I shouldn't have left you out.

37:53.550 --> 37:54.752
But it won't happen again, right?

37:54.784 --> 37:57.922
I promise, never.

38:00.791 --> 38:03.093
Well...

38:03.125 --> 38:04.894
uh, mazel tov on your wedding.

38:04.927 --> 38:05.962
Thank you.

38:05.996 --> 38:08.565
But, uh, as far as
believing your promises,

38:08.597 --> 38:11.601
Paige and I are trying to start
our own family right now,

38:11.634 --> 38:15.171
and when we do, my first promise will be

38:15.204 --> 38:17.040
to never let you near enough

38:17.072 --> 38:20.176
to hurt or disappoint our child.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.012
Are you gonna cut me out of your family?

38:22.045 --> 38:25.449
He's not saying that. Evan...

38:25.482 --> 38:26.949
tell Dad you're not saying that.

38:26.983 --> 38:29.219
I'm not cutting you out.

38:29.251 --> 38:30.753
That's... that's your move.

38:30.786 --> 38:32.522
Paige and I will come to your wedding.

38:32.556 --> 38:35.425
We will wish you well,

38:35.458 --> 38:37.694
but make no mistake...

38:37.726 --> 38:42.132
my first job as a parent will be
protecting my family from you.

38:50.940 --> 38:53.944
(DOOR CLOSES)

39:03.786 --> 39:06.422
So we have been monitoring the eggs

39:06.456 --> 39:10.327
which were successfully fertilized,

39:10.360 --> 39:12.095
and it gives me great
pleasure to inform you

39:12.128 --> 39:14.565
that one has developed
into a blastocyst.

39:14.597 --> 39:16.300
A potentially viable embryo.

39:16.333 --> 39:19.269
Yeah, I know. Just one?

39:19.302 --> 39:21.505
That means all our eggs
are in one basket.

39:21.538 --> 39:23.072
Not until I put it there.

39:23.105 --> 39:25.141
Yeah, but one is all it takes.

39:25.175 --> 39:26.844
Oh, okay.

39:26.876 --> 39:29.279
So are you ready to make the transfer?

39:29.311 --> 39:30.947
Absolutely.

39:32.748 --> 39:34.116
I mean, are you ready?

39:34.150 --> 39:36.921
- Yes. Yes.
