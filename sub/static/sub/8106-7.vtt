WEBVTT

00:13.389 --> 00:16.265
- See you Tuesday.
- How about right now?

00:16.392 --> 00:18.726
What? What?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.437
You wanna throw in the towel?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.897
No, I don't wanna
throw in the... towel!

00:23.023 --> 00:25.233
I thought
that's what you said!

00:25.359 --> 00:26.484
I'm not upset about anything!

00:29.780 --> 00:31.906
Where the... are we going?

00:32.032 --> 00:32.865
What are you doing
down here?

00:32.991 --> 00:35.702
I thought you usually
had lunch with Coma Guy.

00:35.828 --> 00:39.080
This is Vegetative State Guy.
Better company.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.124
Hey, hey, tell him
about those Sherpas

00:41.250 --> 00:43.543
you dropped acid with
in Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

00:43.669 --> 00:47.422
You stole my prescription pad
and you forged my name.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.843
- What did you tell the cop?
- I lied.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.344
They'd have put you away
for 10 years,

00:53.470 --> 00:55.680
after they took your license
to practice medicine.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.056
So, everything's good, then.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.142
I lied. To the cops.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.977
There is no case
unless they can prove

01:01.103 --> 01:03.896
that either I got the drugs illegally
or I sold them illegally.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.107
I didn't do the second,
you lied about the first. Game over.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.859
Yeah, Tritter's just playing.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.528
He's gonna see how clever you are
and then just walk away.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.113
The important thing is
that you keep prescribing

01:12.239 --> 01:15.116
the same amount of drugs to me
or it'll look suspicious.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.117
Here's another way
to look at it,

01:16.243 --> 01:18.327
having forced me
to lie to the police,

01:18.454 --> 01:22.039
your first concern
is securing your drug connection.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.255
Joining my father for lunch?

01:29.840 --> 01:31.257
I should have called ahead
for a table.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.508
Dr. House was just...

01:32.634 --> 01:34.302
Enjoying a Reuben.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.845
It's okay.

01:36.263 --> 01:40.057
After 10 years, anything that'll
get doctors in the same room as...

01:41.560 --> 01:43.394
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.146
What are you doing?

01:47.649 --> 01:48.733
Chips?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.197
Wanna see something
really cool?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.289
I saw you leaving
last Tuesday.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.584
You practically
tripped over two guys on your way out,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.753
but you had no problem
opening doors.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.546
It's called akinetopsia.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.632
You can't see things
when they move.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.135
Now, since you haven't been hit by
a bus, I assume that it's intermittent.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.553
It's probably
accompanied by seizures,

02:17.679 --> 02:21.057
which made me think that
I could set one off by flashing the...

02:27.064 --> 02:29.148
God, I love this family.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.814
I can see fine now.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.527
I've had seizures before.
Most of the time they're small.

03:14.653 --> 03:18.281
Doctors ran me through all the tests.
Couldn't find anything.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.491
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

03:20.617 --> 03:22.535
The only things I know
that run in my family are

03:22.661 --> 03:26.414
a lot of chutzpah
and the ability to sleep for 10 years.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.374
Although
I'm not really an expert.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.334
Dad never really liked
my mother's side of the family,

03:30.460 --> 03:34.547
and after she died and he came here
I was raised by a guardian.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.758
I wouldn't even know
how to get in touch with them.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.427
How about your father's side
of the family?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.845
Any relatives
we could speak with?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.430
My father was an only child.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.931
And my grandparents
are dead.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.266
Well, who did you put down

03:45.392 --> 03:48.102
as the person the hospital
should contact in an emergency?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.270
I left it blank.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.938
There's gotta be someone,
a friend...

03:51.064 --> 03:52.273
I have plenty of friends.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.609
Just no one that would care
if I was here.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.197
Say, do you mind passing me
my backpack?

04:15.047 --> 04:16.714
Hair of the dog.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.010
Could be infection.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.303
Or a brain tumor.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.346
Says he had a CT.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.556
What's wrong
with the simplest explanation? Trauma?

04:25.682 --> 04:26.933
He didn't report any injuries.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.060
He didn't report
being an alcoholic, either.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.437
Drinking equals falling down
equals trauma equals...

04:31.563 --> 04:32.855
Maybe it's inherited.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.651
How would you jump to genetics
from his EEG?

04:36.985 --> 04:39.362
All you've got are some vaguely
epileptiform waves.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.615
It's not his EEG.
It's his father's.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.785
When it comes to cortical seizures,
like father, like son.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.411
Small seizures
aren't unheard of

04:47.537 --> 04:48.746
in a patient
in a vegetative state.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.373
Similarities
are interesting, though.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.124
What caused
the vegetative state?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.876
His house burned down.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.544
Went back in to get his wife,

04:55.671 --> 04:57.296
firefighters
found him unconscious

04:57.422 --> 04:59.465
three feet from the bedroom,
asphyxiated.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.425
Not an inherited condition.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.179
Test his DNA. Start with
adrenomyeloneuropathy.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.348
Check out the home.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.064
He has a single bed.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.066
They still make single beds?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.693
It could mean
he just doesn't have sex,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.028
though there were condoms
in the apartment.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.615
House asked you to check out
the home for toxins.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.951
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.036
MRI and LP
are both inconclusive.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.997
Infection's still possible,
tumor's less likely, but...

05:31.123 --> 05:33.207
- DNA?
- The adrenomyeloneuropathy test

05:33.333 --> 05:35.292
- was negative.
- DNA test again.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.712
Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.296
Genetic tests
take forever.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.381
You can't keep testing

05:40.507 --> 05:42.341
for every inherited condition
you think it might be.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.594
Well, not me.
I'll be leaving early. But you guys can.

05:49.474 --> 05:53.102
You said no one's been sick but
what about delivery people, repair guy?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.563
I wouldn't know.
I work from home.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.982
Haven't been to the office
in over a month.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.108
Visitors?

05:59.234 --> 06:00.526
Haven't had any.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.445
The only person
I've seen in the last week

06:02.571 --> 06:05.781
was the pizza delivery guy
and he looked pretty healthy.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.576
There's gotta be someone
you're close to.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.205
Actually, the person
I see most often is my father.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.460
He's asleep
so he can't stop me.

06:21.923 --> 06:22.757
What is it?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.092
I'm just feeling
a little nauseous.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.389
I think his liver's failing.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.060
God. Does that mean
that I'm...

06:38.440 --> 06:39.565
We need a central line kit,

06:39.691 --> 06:42.651
two units of packed red blood cells
type O Negative.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.155
He's unconscious
and heading for a coma.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.990
He's at a four
on the RLAS scale.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.452
Stop all treatment.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.121
You think this is a reaction
to our meds?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.457
Well, they're obviously
not helping.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.000
Given the fact
that he's an alcoholic,

06:58.126 --> 07:00.336
there's a good chance
his liver wasn't so hot when he came in.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.838
Anti-seizure drugs could have
just pushed him over the edge.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.424
We take him off those meds,
what do we put him on?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.634
I was hoping you'd know.

07:06.802 --> 07:10.054
It may be academic,
I just started him on dialysis.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.891
Kidney and liver failure.
Not too many people come back from that.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.227
Trauma's out of the picture.
Could still be infection.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.270
- Or neurological...
- Or genetic.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.816
We need a better history.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.070
Did you miss the part
where the patient lost consciousness?

07:27.531 --> 07:29.406
L-dopa?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.910
You're not waking Kyle.
You're waking his father.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.912
I commend
your observational skills.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.163
You have no reason to think

07:36.289 --> 07:38.415
any amount of drugs
will wake a man from a coma.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.292
Vegetative state.
Much easier.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.420
This guy's no Terri Schiavo,
his brain's all there, he moves around,

07:43.547 --> 07:45.131
his muscles
have barely atrophied.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.383
He's just waiting
for a fairy-tale kiss.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.136
After I do that,
I'll stick a needle in him.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.141
The amount of amphetamines alone
would be dangerous,

07:55.267 --> 07:57.268
besides whatever the hell else
you've got in there.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.520
There are reports
out of South Africa

07:59.646 --> 08:03.941
about a pill that would temporarily
revive someone in a vegetative state.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.986
You've all seen Awakenings,
made me cry.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.362
I wanna cry.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.573
Put the syringe down.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.994
I can outdraw you,
mysterious stranger.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.246
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.623
Be reasonable.
There's no way this is gonna work.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.376
Even if you woke him,
it would only be for a few hours.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.253
A day, two at the most.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.796
You're risking his life.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.465
I'm risking getting sued,
that's the only objection here.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.135
You'll be torturing him
and his family.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.638
Well, good news for Legal, the only
family he's got is upstairs dying.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.806
Hey!

08:44.274 --> 08:46.901
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.611
I want someone with him
at all times

08:48.737 --> 08:50.070
to make sure
you didn't kill him.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.489
I want your ass in my office.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.911
God, I'm starving.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.958
I could really go for a steak.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.342
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you are?

09:12.344 --> 09:15.387
Gabriel Wozniak.
I don't know the name of this hospital.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.223
How much are three and five?

09:18.433 --> 09:19.642
Eight.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.854
Also known as half of 16,
a quarter of 32, two to the third power.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.523
Coolest thing ever.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.943
Any history of seizure
in your family?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.694
- No.
- Liver disease?

09:30.820 --> 09:31.779
No.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.198
How long have I been here?
I...

09:34.991 --> 09:37.117
I got the feeling
it's been a long time.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.118
Interesting.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.621
Your internal clock
kept ticking.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.123
How deep
does that awareness go?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.625
Pick up scraps
of conversations?

09:44.751 --> 09:45.584
Do you have the vague sense

09:45.710 --> 09:48.128
that the hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

09:48.255 --> 09:51.382
Or that the new Star Wars movies
were a disappointment?

09:53.969 --> 09:56.679
I know my wife is dead.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.768
I don't know
how long it's been.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.856
Ten years.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.364
What's the last thing
you remember?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.075
The fire.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.996
My wife was in the bedroom,
she had taken a sleeping pill.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.874
I got Kyle out,
went back in for her.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.962
I knew I didn't make it.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.213
I'm sorry.

10:31.923 --> 10:35.092
What about your wife's side of the
family? Any history of seizures there?

10:35.218 --> 10:38.095
Your son Kyle
is a patient here.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.433
I'm afraid his condition is serious.
He may be dying.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.939
No seizure issues
on my wife's side, either.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.860
What about that steak?
Nobody ever answered me.

10:57.949 --> 11:02.161
Rumor in the cafeteria
was Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.871
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy

11:03.997 --> 11:06.498
was woken by,
yeah, Caustic Guy.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.499
So what happened?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.794
I gotta get him a steak
before I can ask him any more questions.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.171
He doesn't wanna talk
about his son?

11:12.297 --> 11:15.132
Didn't seem to emotionally register
that his son is sick.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.300
Brain issue?

11:16.426 --> 11:18.969
He was asphyxiated,
spent 10 years as asparagus,

11:19.095 --> 11:21.263
- who knows what damage is in there.
- It's possible.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.640
Of course there's always
the simple explanation.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.893
Maybe he just
doesn't like his son.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.853
Only in your world
would that be simple.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.022
The delusion
that fathering a child

11:30.148 --> 11:32.524
installs a permanent geyser
of unconditional love...

11:32.650 --> 11:35.110
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional, not everyone's.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.362
Well, of course,
that would play into

11:36.488 --> 11:37.613
your romantic vision
of human...

11:37.739 --> 11:39.198
In terms
you would understand,

11:39.324 --> 11:40.824
we have
an evolutionary incentive

11:40.950 --> 11:42.451
to sacrifice
for our offspring.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.829
Our tribe, our friends.
Keep them safe.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.083
Except for all the people
who don't.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.251
Everything is conditional.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.214
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.393
Mind if we talk
for a few minutes?

12:08.937 --> 12:12.314
How many pills would you say
Dr. House takes a day?

12:13.608 --> 12:15.567
I'm uncomfortable
setting a number.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.027
Well, try.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.238
Six.

12:20.949 --> 12:21.782
A day?

12:23.952 --> 12:27.663
Has he ever had you
write prescriptions for him?

12:28.123 --> 12:30.290
No. What is it
you want me to say?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.793
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger to the hospital,

12:32.919 --> 12:36.046
or he takes too few because
he's selling them on the side?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.506
Either one is ridiculous.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.217
I meant the former.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.635
You're wrong.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.973
Can I ask what Dr. House has done
to deserve your loyalty?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.933
He's not known
as a great boss.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.476
He's not even
much of a friend.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.771
Look how he left
Dr. Wilson holding the bag.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.945
It's odd.
You don't know about that?

13:00.363 --> 13:05.742
You defend him, and he won't even
tell you what's happening in his life.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.589
I was paged.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.048
We saw you with the cop.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.509
- What'd he want?
- How many pills does House take,

13:22.635 --> 13:23.677
did I ever write him
a prescription?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.262
That sort of stuff.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.557
- I told him six.
- A day or in a mouthful?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.601
I was just hoping you guys
would stay consistent with...

13:30.727 --> 13:32.227
He wants to talk to us, too?

13:32.353 --> 13:33.812
You're next.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.191
We've gotta tell House
what's going on.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.109
- Tritter says no.
- Then no it is.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.404
Cops have a thousand ways
to make life difficult for you.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.823
Quick.
What's the kid's status?

13:44.949 --> 13:45.949
I gotta get back
to our sleeper

13:46.075 --> 13:48.911
before he goes looking
for the orgasmatron.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.540
See, if that were rhetorical,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.501
it would mean that I can just
turn around and leave now,

13:55.627 --> 13:57.252
which I'm not doing,
from which you should deduce...

13:57.378 --> 13:59.838
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.840
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.967
He's still sliding into coma.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.148
Your barber sucks.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.569
Hey, Coma Diet,

14:22.695 --> 14:23.946
I could make a fortune.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.989
Vegetative State Diet.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.241
Who gave you your clothes?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.742
Dr. Cuddy.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.869
I guess I'll need
all new ones, anyway.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.621
Everything went in the fire.

14:32.747 --> 14:33.872
Don't worry about it.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.251
We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.170
Your son's
measles vaccination,

14:40.296 --> 14:42.005
do you remember if he had it,
what type it was?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.383
Man, you're a piece of work,
you know that?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.178
You weren't gonna tell me,
were you?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.304
I don't need new clothes.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.182
Dr. Cuddy says my body
will adjust to the drugs,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.226
that I'll be
a vegetable again by tomorrow.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.979
If I'm really lucky,
the day after.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.481
Yeah.

14:59.983 --> 15:00.816
If I've got a day to live,

15:00.942 --> 15:03.193
I'm not gonna spend it in a hospital
room being grilled.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.987
Come on, where you gonna go?

15:05.113 --> 15:08.991
Your house burned down,
your wife's dead. Business was sold off.

15:09.117 --> 15:13.120
The only thing you have left is down
the hall, heading for a liver biopsy.

15:14.706 --> 15:20.210
Used to be this little hole in the wall
run by a guy named Giancarlo.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.213
Made the best hoagies
in the world.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.592
Real Italian rolls,
prosciutto, provolone...

15:29.637 --> 15:31.597
How far is Atlantic City
from here?

15:31.723 --> 15:35.100
You have one day to live,
and you want a sandwich?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.185
People on death row
get a last meal.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.480
The state provides it.
Who's providing for you?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.734
You got a car? Money?

15:45.361 --> 15:47.321
You're negotiating with me.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.913
Take out another 100 for me.
And I need your car.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.665
I'm not doing you any favors.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.376
You'll get it back tomorrow.
Two days, max.

16:01.836 --> 16:02.794
Road trip.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.179
This is like trying
to control the weather,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.389
but I'd prefer it
if you didn't eat in the car,

16:14.515 --> 16:16.016
I just had it detailed.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.809
- I drive.
- Oh, the hell he does.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.061
Sure.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.731
Aside from the fact he just woke up
from a vegetative state,

16:22.857 --> 16:23.940
the guy doesn't
have a license.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.652
How about this?
Cops stop us, we lie.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.237
You know how to do that.
Chips.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.076
It's all the drugs
pumping through his system.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.828
Right now his reflexes are better
than Dale Earnhardt Jr's.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.665
What's this? It says ipod.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.211
I'm coming.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.304
So let's talk about
toxic exposure.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.812
What was wrong with the old colors?
I trusted brown.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.398
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

17:04.524 --> 17:05.857
Raspberry cocaine.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.819
This house that burned down,
where was it?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.278
Moorestown, New Jersey.

17:10.405 --> 17:13.990
Listen, I really need to know about the
candy because I'm allergic to berries.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.033
You didn't mention that.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.576
Is it significant?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.912
No. So where else
did you live?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.081
List everywhere,
including vacations,

17:21.207 --> 17:22.874
start with
when your wife got pregnant.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.378
We lived in Jersey. Then we moved
to Jersey, from there, Jersey.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.548
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage in the Amazon

17:29.674 --> 17:31.800
with the mosquitoes
and the lead paint all over the walls?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.093
Yes.

17:33.845 --> 17:34.845
You know what?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.930
I didn't let you come along
so you could suck all the fun

17:37.056 --> 17:39.057
out of my one day of life.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.352
Well, you're outta luck,
because that's totally why I'm here.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.481
Okay, rule change.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.943
Person with the money makes the rules.
Or in this case,

17:50.069 --> 17:53.405
the person who's friends with the person
with the money makes the rules.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.241
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.368
All right, so here's the game.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.120
Ask whatever you want.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.707
But for every question I answer,
you have to answer one first.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.959
Why would you care
about anything I have to say?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.379
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.258
I had a factory
with over 200 employees.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.260
People listened when I talked.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.637
I liked power.

18:19.307 --> 18:25.020
Now, the only power I have left
is the power to annoy you.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.320
I took Wilson's assistant
for coffee.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.947
- Why?
- Something Tritter said.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.365
She told me the police think

18:37.492 --> 18:41.119
that House stole Wilson's
prescription pad and forged his name.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.872
You believe it?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.083
- Do you?
- Well, absolutely I do.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.710
I'm just checking
how naive you are.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.296
He's not gonna steal his best friend's
pad, jeopardize his career.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.673
Until his best friend
says no to him.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
House is a junkie.

18:54.926 --> 18:58.136
Junkies do whatever they have to do
to get what they need.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.933
Kyle's down to a three
on the RLAS scale.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.894
He's only showing
localized response.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.773
I'll call House, tell him
we're gonna need an answer soon.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.277
Get in your right lane
for 295.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.571
And pass me the Twizzlers.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.410
- I'm curious...
- No, you're not.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.204
Why would
a man's first instinct

19:24.330 --> 19:26.206
be to drive away
from the only family he's got?

19:26.332 --> 19:29.584
No, this is no time
for you to do your thing.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.795
We don't care about his state of mind,
we don't care if he's happy.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.422
This factory of yours,
what did you make?

19:38.553 --> 19:40.303
So ask me a question.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.763
I'm thinking.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.557
Only six left, by the way.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.393
So sign my name.
You don't need a doctor, you need a pen.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.644
What is up with you two?

19:47.770 --> 19:50.939
Wilson lied to the bulls
to keep me out of the big house.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.482
Are you out of your mind?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.150
Well, who's he gonna tell?

19:54.277 --> 19:57.571
By tomorrow night he's gonna be
a mindless stalk of celery.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.407
Since I answered that one,
by the way, my turn.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.908
What did you make
in your factory?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.451
Luxury boats.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.954
Have you ever been in love?

20:06.080 --> 20:06.955
Wow!

20:07.081 --> 20:09.916
Going right for the clostes
with the embarrassing stuff. Good move.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.002
Yes. Describe the boats.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.755
Thirty-five to 65-foot hulls, twin
engines, parquet floors in the galley,

20:15.882 --> 20:17.883
staterooms with queen beds.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.219
- How'd you meet?
- She shot me.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.890
These boats, I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint on the hulls?

20:25.016 --> 20:26.683
Naturally. Shot you?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.520
Paintball.
Doctors versus lawyers.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.022
Did you ever take your son
to the factory?

20:32.148 --> 20:36.234
Sure. He used to run all over the place,
but it was perfectly safe.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.528
Ever love anybody else?

20:39.780 --> 20:42.449
No more questions,
I got my answer.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.328
While Dad's in the office,
his son's watching them spray-paint.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.121
And what kid wears a mask?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.999
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.250
You're saying
this is my fault?

20:52.376 --> 20:54.461
Mercury poisoning
explains the seizures

20:54.587 --> 20:56.463
and the liver's like
a big soup strainer.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.215
The soup runs through,
chicken dumplings stay.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.425
For soup, read blood,
for chicken...

21:00.551 --> 21:02.385
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.720
Sits more or less idle

21:03.846 --> 21:07.182
until your kid
pours tequila shooters into his liver.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.977
When the liver goes, takes out
the kidneys, explains everything.

21:11.103 --> 21:11.978
Yeah, it's me.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.065
Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.150
Chase,
start heavy metal chelation

21:17.276 --> 21:18.735
while we're waiting
for results.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.363
Chase isn't here.
I'll start the...

21:21.489 --> 21:23.156
Where is he?

21:24.659 --> 21:25.659
The lab.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.874
How many pills
does he take a day?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.461
It's hard to say,
pain levels vary over time...

21:36.587 --> 21:39.673
Could be six, eight, ten.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.092
Ever write
any prescriptions for him?

21:42.218 --> 21:43.635
- Yes.
- Why?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.178
Did he tell you to?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.180
He asked me to.

21:54.480 --> 22:00.485
Medicine attracts people
who are attracted to power.

22:00.987 --> 22:05.198
I know how he hates
when he is defied by a patient.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.744
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.830
Now you correct me
if I'm wrong,

22:11.956 --> 22:15.458
but I don't think
Dr. House asks for anything.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.420
I think he takes it.

22:18.546 --> 22:23.425
And I think that you are stuck
lying to the police

22:24.593 --> 22:28.513
to cover up something
you didn't wanna do.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.774
We have been up and down
St. James like a Monopoly car.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.737
It's not here.
Giancarlo has left the building.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.159
We can still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.454
No. We've come this far,
I'm getting the hoagie.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.250
If your son does
have mercury poisoning,

22:57.376 --> 22:59.335
there's a good chance
he'll respond to the chelation.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.421
You might be able to have
a few minutes with him before you lapse.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.090
Why are you so concerned
about me?

23:05.092 --> 23:08.011
Deep inside Wilson believes
that if he cares enough

23:08.137 --> 23:09.804
he'll never have to die.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.182
Your behavior isn't normal.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.350
And you would know normal?

23:14.477 --> 23:17.562
What could he have done
that you won't forgive after 10 years?

23:17.688 --> 23:19.606
When this
is your last chance?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.942
My son is what he is.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.945
His mother's side,
all drunken losers.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.782
He's gone the same way.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.495
House told you drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

23:33.621 --> 23:34.788
I just said that.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.164
But you didn't hear
him say that

23:36.290 --> 23:38.333
until after
we left the hospital.

23:38.459 --> 23:39.959
So why did you leave?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.464
Maybe your son
takes after your side.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.884
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.719
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.807
We're in Atlantic City
and my time's not up yet.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.267
We find a hotel
with a casino.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.400
BP's starting to drop.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.569
O2-sat's down to 70.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.534
Point-three milligrams
of epi in.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.285
What are you trying to do,
make him bleed faster?

24:14.411 --> 24:16.246
Check the pulse.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.456
It's not his liver.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.876
It's the heart.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.087
I understand
he's a French chef

24:24.213 --> 24:26.047
but I'm sure
he can handle this.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.091
You need a 12-inch
Italian roll,

24:28.217 --> 24:32.262
oregano vinegar, no,
not balsamic vinegar, oregano vinegar.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.306
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

24:36.058 --> 24:37.267
Game's still on.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.686
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.729
What other questions
would you care about?

24:41.856 --> 24:42.981
If you each had
one day to live,

24:43.107 --> 24:46.651
you'd look for one last meal and House
would look for one last answer.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.029
No, can you just
send the ingredients up here

24:50.156 --> 24:52.157
and I'll make it myself.

24:52.908 --> 24:56.578
Last 10 years,
how much awareness did you have?

24:56.704 --> 24:59.622
I don't know,
I knew it wasn't the next day.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.249
I knew that...

25:02.251 --> 25:04.085
I recognized your voice.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.796
How often were you in my room?

25:06.922 --> 25:09.340
No, you're wasting a question.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.508
I have a better one.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.970
Why steal my pad?

25:14.096 --> 25:16.806
Oh, my God, you're right.
I'm an addict.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.391
Thanks for opening my eyes.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.351
No, I mean why my pad?

25:20.769 --> 25:23.771
Foreman, Cameron and Chase's pads
are just as convenient.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.774
But their association with you
is involuntary, they're employees.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.693
I associate with you
through choice

25:28.819 --> 25:30.445
and any relationship
that involves choice

25:30.571 --> 25:33.239
you have to see
how far you can push before it breaks.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.657
This is easy.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.119
You ask the questions,
answer them and make tasty snacks.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.914
Let's go try the casino.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.874
And one day
our friendship will break

25:43.000 --> 25:46.336
and that'll just prove your theory
that relationships are conditional

25:46.462 --> 25:49.214
and you don't need
human connection or deserve it,

25:49.340 --> 25:52.300
or whatever goes on
in that rat-maze of your brain.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.594
Sorry, if I'd known
he was gonna be this annoying,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.262
I would have stolen
Dr. Cameron's pad

25:56.388 --> 25:58.181
and Dr. Foreman's car.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.226
At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.562
House's House of Whining,
state your complaint.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.314
The patient's BP
just dropped like a stone.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.273
Do an echo.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.858
Mercury isn't likely
to damage the...

26:08.984 --> 26:10.026
It didn't.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.861
Mercury test was negative.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.990
Do an echo.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.457
I was wrong.
Your son's still dying.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.378
I need to go over
every relative you ever had. Again.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.422
And this time, forget their diseases,
just tell me how they died.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.508
And we don't have time
to take turns.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.843
You give me the answers,
you get a big one at the end.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.303
You can go
for whatever you want.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.889
Destroy my privacy,
my dignity.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.231
Your grandmother?

26:48.357 --> 26:50.483
Heat exhaustion,
Fourth of July picnic.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.985
The woman was 92.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.529
Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

26:54.655 --> 26:56.281
that used to be
on St. James Place?

26:56.407 --> 26:58.533
You sister-in-law
with the diabetes.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.034
As far as you know, is she still alive?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.744
She's not. She was killed
in a traffic accident

27:01.870 --> 27:03.496
driving home
from a Phillies game.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.123
I'm sure a lot of beer
was consumed.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.041
- The Phillies lost.
- Your father?

27:07.167 --> 27:09.294
Old age.
Heart finally gave out.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.670
Your wife's father?

27:10.796 --> 27:13.506
Hit-and-run,
walking the incontinent dog.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.301
Hi, do you guys deliver?

27:17.928 --> 27:18.803
Let me put it this way,

27:18.929 --> 27:21.973
if you deliver, there'll be
a $100 tip in it for you.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.267
Excellent.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.770
- Victory.
- The night is finally going my way.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.148
Wilson, toss me a soda.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.873
Shall we go somewhere
to talk?

27:47.875 --> 27:49.083
House is an ass.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.336
But he obviously needs
pain medication,

27:51.462 --> 27:52.879
and how much pain
one person feels

27:53.005 --> 27:55.340
is not a call
the government should be making.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.508
So you think
I'm a bureaucrat with a badge

27:57.634 --> 27:59.719
following
some arbitrary guideline.

28:00.471 --> 28:01.804
Yeah, I do.

28:02.431 --> 28:06.559
So you're saying
I should just trust him. Do you?

28:06.685 --> 28:10.313
- You're not qualified to make that...
- I'm not sure you are, either.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.148
I've been a cop for 20 years.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.107
And not a day goes by

28:13.233 --> 28:17.737
that someone doesn't try
to sell me some self-serving story.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.615
If you had my job,
you'd know.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.743
Everybody lies.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.044
I think
you've run out of relatives.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.130
So, it's my turn.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.261
Why did you become a doctor?

28:42.388 --> 28:43.805
That's the big question?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.724
I give you complete license
to humiliate me

28:46.850 --> 28:48.226
and that's the best
you can do.

28:48.352 --> 28:51.312
Well, okay, let's discuss
the wonder of the human body.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.606
No, no, no.
You're a curious guy.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.984
You like to figure things out,
why not go into research?

28:57.111 --> 28:58.820
Why work with people when you

28:59.655 --> 29:01.531
obviously hate people?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.450
Oedipal fixation.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.785
I was seeking
my mother's love

29:05.911 --> 29:08.079
and she thought that Ben Casey
was just the dreamiest...

29:08.205 --> 29:12.208
Okay, fine. You don't think
you'll need any more answers from me?

29:12.334 --> 29:13.418
Give me a hard time.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.470
When I was 14,

29:25.931 --> 29:28.057
my father was stationed
in Japan.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.561
I went rock-climbing
with this kid from school.

29:31.687 --> 29:35.106
He fell and got injured
and I had to bring him to the hospital.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.818
And we came in through
the wrong entrance

29:38.944 --> 29:40.736
and passed this guy
in the hall.

29:42.698 --> 29:43.781
He was a janitor.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.200
My friend came down
with an infection

29:46.326 --> 29:48.995
and the doctors didn't know
what to do.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.830
So they brought in

29:52.624 --> 29:53.916
the janitor.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.337
He was a doctor.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.883
And a buraku.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.428
One of Japan's untouchables.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.516
His ancestors
had been slaughterers, gravediggers.

30:11.852 --> 30:12.935
And this guy,

30:14.897 --> 30:17.523
he knew that he wasn't
accepted by the staff, didn't even try.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.860
He didn't dress well,
he didn't pretend to be one of them.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.071
The people around that place,

30:24.198 --> 30:26.908
they didn't think
he had anything they wanted,

30:29.161 --> 30:30.870
except when they needed him.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.332
Because he was right.

30:36.210 --> 30:38.836
Which meant
that nothing else mattered.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.048
And they had to listen to him.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.476
Thank you.

30:57.231 --> 30:59.982
Need 20 milligrams of diazepam
in a syringe.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.116
Heartbeat's irregular
and accelerating.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.701
- He's at 200.
- He's gonna crash.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.161
Allergic reaction
to the diazepam?

31:12.287 --> 31:13.120
Better hope so.

31:13.247 --> 31:16.082
It's either that
or his heart's done.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.466
What happened
on the night of the fire?

31:29.346 --> 31:32.932
Yeah. I'm sure it's a stressful,
emotional question.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.100
Suck it up.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.189
My wife had taken a sleeping pill
and gone to bed.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.148
It was Christmas Eve.

31:41.275 --> 31:44.277
I let Kyle pop corn
in the fireplace.

31:45.279 --> 31:48.614
He managed to knock loose
some tinder.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.741
Wrapping paper caught on fire.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.160
It spread so fast.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.079
I got Kyle out and...

31:56.123 --> 31:57.999
When I went back in for...

32:02.379 --> 32:03.921
You're a disappointment.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.176
You act as though
you don't need anybody, you...

32:09.303 --> 32:11.345
You just blame your son
for what happened.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.265
I don't blame him.
He was a 12-year-old boy.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.267
You don't blame a kid
for an accident.

32:16.393 --> 32:18.019
Then what are we doing here?
Why aren't you with him?

32:18.145 --> 32:20.062
Because it wouldn't matter.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.024
I failed
to keep my family safe.

32:23.150 --> 32:26.736
I couldn't stop the fire,
I couldn't save my wife,

32:26.862 --> 32:30.573
now you want me to stick around watching
while I fail to save my son.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.242
Thank you so much
for waking me up.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.460
How did your son
dislodge the tinder?

32:43.879 --> 32:45.087
God...

32:48.258 --> 32:50.301
He dropped the popcorn tray.

32:50.427 --> 32:53.596
He had been complaining it was
too heavy, I should have listened.

32:53.722 --> 32:57.058
And the hit-and-run,
walking the pissy dog.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.768
That happen at night?

32:58.894 --> 33:00.353
I think so, yeah, why?

33:00.479 --> 33:03.022
Car accident
after the Phillies lost.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.523
Night game?

33:06.902 --> 33:08.778
Ragged-red fiber.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.196
It's an inherited condition.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.366
Dropping things, muscle weakness,
poor night vision.

33:13.492 --> 33:17.286
Makes people seem uncoordinated,
accident-prone, careless.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.789
It's transmitted
in mitochondrial DNA

33:19.915 --> 33:21.749
so it only passes
through the mother.

33:21.875 --> 33:25.294
Your wife's family
weren't drunks, they were sick.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.004
It wouldn't have
affected his liver.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.673
The kid is a drunk.

33:28.799 --> 33:29.882
He thinks that
he killed his mother

33:30.008 --> 33:31.967
and turned his father
into a vegetable.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.220
I might have
a few shots myself.

33:35.472 --> 33:36.597
Foreman.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.725
Test his DNA
for ragged-red fiber.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.268
- It's not gonna...
- Here's a thought.

33:41.395 --> 33:44.397
Why don't we not assume that the test
is negative until we actually do it?

33:44.523 --> 33:48.192
House, the kid
has severe cardiomyopathy.

33:48.819 --> 33:52.071
Alcoholic,
no shot at a transplant.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.865
So yeah, maybe you figured out why,
good for you, but

33:56.451 --> 33:58.369
he's gonna die anyway.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.188
I want to give
Kyle my heart.

34:30.402 --> 34:35.197
This thing, whatever it is,
you said he gets it from the mother.

34:35.323 --> 34:36.490
My heart's fine.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.910
And it could go on being fine
for the rest of your life.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.038
Yeah, it's not like he's gonna
do anything with it.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.498
Well, you woke him up once,

34:44.624 --> 34:47.251
maybe someone'll come up
with some other answer.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.879
We've both seen breakthroughs
no one expected.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.925
And ragged-red fiber's
treatable, but not curable.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.387
Even if he gets your heart,
there's no guarantee.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.183
He's my kid.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.102
No!

35:05.228 --> 35:07.021
Did you really expect
a different answer?

35:07.147 --> 35:10.816
We have arranged transplants
before when a patient is near death.

35:10.942 --> 35:15.446
Except he isn't near death, he's saying,
"Kill me and cut out my heart."

35:15.572 --> 35:17.198
Are you out of your mind?

35:18.533 --> 35:21.160
Fine.
I'll think of something else.

35:22.579 --> 35:23.788
I'm sorry.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.473
Wilson, get out.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.019
No.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.983
You lied to the cops
enough for me.

35:57.739 --> 36:00.574
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.724
Pills are the simplest.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.231
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.361
I'm okay with pain.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.866
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck,

36:43.827 --> 36:45.452
which means this'll be slow.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.585
I wouldn't get to see him
even if we got in the car right now

36:52.711 --> 36:55.671
and broke the speed limit driving back,
would I?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.215
No.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.136
Tell him...

37:11.730 --> 37:13.939
I don't know
what to tell him.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.740
I think it's my turn
to ask a question, isn't it?

37:22.866 --> 37:24.283
I don't think so.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.745
'Cause you just asked me that thing
about the speed limit.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.042
What do you wanna know?

37:33.168 --> 37:36.712
If you could hear one thing
from your father, what would it be?

37:38.840 --> 37:40.215
It wouldn't help you.

37:40.342 --> 37:41.175
Try me.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.599
I'd want him to say,

37:52.228 --> 37:53.646
"You were right.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.024
"You did the right thing."

37:59.444 --> 38:02.363
Yeah. It doesn't help.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.297
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.884
I'm Dr. Wilson.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.220
I'm Mrs. Schaffer.

38:26.346 --> 38:27.972
I'm from Princeton.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.559
My husband and I and our three children
live in Philadelphia.

38:36.606 --> 38:40.359
So, do you like to swing?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.154
No.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.783
Well, if you
change your mind, I'm in...

38:50.078 --> 38:52.162
House? House?

38:52.288 --> 38:54.748
Is it room 622, 642?

38:55.083 --> 38:56.083
622.

38:57.127 --> 39:00.379
- 662.
- Yeah.

39:15.895 --> 39:16.979
Alibi.

39:19.733 --> 39:20.941
I figured.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.325
They found an open bottle of aspirin
by the body.

40:13.036 --> 40:17.623
Lucky he had a headache,
reduced trauma to the heart in transit.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.375
Lucky.

40:33.306 --> 40:34.765
That can't be all.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.393
Well, you got a heart
out of it.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.521
How many organs
do you want from the guy?

40:40.647 --> 40:43.440
I mean, my father
must have said something.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.692
He couldn't just...

40:45.819 --> 40:49.571
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.745
He said you were right.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.748
You did the right thing.

41:04.504 --> 41:05.879
Right about what?

41:08.133 --> 41:09.758
What does that mean?

41:10.885 --> 41:13.971
How would I know?
He's your dad.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.528
You know what I found interesting
about this case?

41:29.821 --> 41:32.489
That it proved that people
can love unconditionally

41:32.615 --> 41:34.199
and you can tell yourself
it's not true,

41:34.325 --> 41:36.994
but you'll just end up
in a hotel room in Atlantic City

41:37.120 --> 41:38.412
asking someone
to cut your heart out?

41:38.538 --> 41:40.581
The hoagie.

41:40.707 --> 41:43.000
You thought this guy
was emotionally confused,

41:43.126 --> 41:44.626
and that the hoagie
was just a mask

41:44.752 --> 41:47.671
to hide his real feelings
toward his son.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.047
It was.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.925
Did you know Tritter was talking
to your team while we were away?

41:52.051 --> 41:53.010
Yeah.

41:53.678 --> 41:54.928
And yet you moved
Heaven and Earth

41:55.054 --> 41:58.056
to get him that mask
with mustard and prosciutto.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.600
Which one of them told you?

41:59.726 --> 42:01.143
All of them.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.395
Which means that none of them
said anything I have to worry about.

42:03.521 --> 42:04.855
Back to the hoagie.

42:04.981 --> 42:07.065
You think that
my addiction's out of hand.

42:07.192 --> 42:11.028
Your need to be needed is so strong
that you'll give people what they want,

42:11.154 --> 42:12.696
what they need,
what they think they need.

42:12.822 --> 42:16.783
I don't think my enabling is anything
you should be complaining about.

42:17.076 --> 42:19.328
Yes, my name
is Dr. James Wilson,

42:19.954 --> 42:22.664
account number 835687.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.792
The ATM says
I've got zero...

42:27.503 --> 42:29.296
What does that mean, a hold?

42:32.383 --> 42:34.384
Yeah, okay, thanks.

42:39.933 --> 42:43.727
My accounts have been frozen
as part of a police investigation.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.399
They can't keep
your money forever.

42:50.860 --> 42:55.405
No, they can keep it till I agree
to help send you to prison for 10 years.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.162
You're getting dinner.
