01:08.134 --> 01:09.402
I will rematch him.

01:09.435 --> 01:10.335
I will rematch him.

01:10.368 --> 01:11.570
Oh, okay, get up there.

01:15.875 --> 01:16.676
Have a conversation
about who goes first

01:16.709 --> 01:19.478
and who goes second,
who goes third.

01:19.512 --> 01:20.513
What do you want to do?

01:20.546 --> 01:21.848
You wanna hit some?

01:21.881 --> 01:22.715
Yeah.

01:28.153 --> 01:29.688
There you go.

01:41.799 --> 01:42.602
Wow.

01:43.701 --> 01:44.703
That's the real deal.

01:46.171 --> 01:47.840
How you doing son,
let's try it again.

01:50.543 --> 01:51.344
What's your name?

01:51.376 --> 01:52.477
Chance.

01:52.510 --> 01:53.313
Chance.

01:54.245 --> 01:56.149
That's an awesome name.

01:56.182 --> 01:59.152
All right Chance, we're gonna
do it again, same energy,

01:59.185 --> 02:02.856
but I want you to keep your
eyes right here on this dot.

02:03.923 --> 02:04.924
Mm-hm.

02:04.956 --> 02:05.757
Yeah?

02:05.790 --> 02:07.393
Hear my voice.

02:07.426 --> 02:08.228
Kill that dot.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.801
Again.

02:16.835 --> 02:18.138
Kill that dot.

02:20.939 --> 02:22.441
Again.

02:24.475 --> 02:27.346
Swing like you're coming
out of your shoes, Chance.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.617
Chance, I want you
to swing like that

02:32.651 --> 02:34.687
for the rest of your life.

02:34.719 --> 02:35.521
You're a hitter.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.491
All right, next.

02:38.524 --> 02:39.692
Who wants to kill the dot?

02:39.724 --> 02:40.859
Me!

02:56.008 --> 02:57.909
All right, play's at first.

02:57.943 --> 02:58.878
Pay attention.

03:01.847 --> 03:02.848
Ben!

03:02.881 --> 03:03.682
Get your head in the game.

03:03.716 --> 03:04.884
What are you doing?

03:04.917 --> 03:06.451
Play's at first
means pay attention.

03:06.485 --> 03:08.287
Yeah, pay attention Ben.

03:08.319 --> 03:09.555
Chance, go two!

03:14.960 --> 03:16.296
Come on, Chance!

03:20.366 --> 03:22.869
Come on, get your gloves down!

03:23.868 --> 03:25.737
Chance, keep throwing hard.

03:29.875 --> 03:30.710
Go one!

03:35.948 --> 03:37.817
Come on, hit your cutoff man!

03:37.849 --> 03:39.418
Heck of an arm, boy.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.253
There's
nothing there, let's go.

03:41.287 --> 03:41.920
Come on!

03:46.292 --> 03:47.425
Your son seems sensitive.

03:47.459 --> 03:48.593
Yeah.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.396
Yeah he don't
handle stress well.

03:50.429 --> 03:51.597
When he was a baby he'd cry

03:51.629 --> 03:52.931
until he turned
blue and passed out.

03:53.998 --> 03:55.400
Really?

03:55.433 --> 03:56.034
I never heard of that.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.003
Yup.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.670
He was my little blue baby.

03:58.704 --> 04:01.274
Had to take him to the
hospital a couple of times.

04:01.306 --> 04:02.674
He's around any kind
of confrontation

04:02.707 --> 04:05.578
he'll just run off and cry.

04:05.610 --> 04:06.945
Born intense, my kind of guy.

04:08.614 --> 04:10.716
You think baseball
will help with that?

04:10.748 --> 04:12.418
Baseball helps
with everything.

04:14.485 --> 04:16.656
Don't be afraid to
make mistakes, Chance!

04:16.689 --> 04:17.757
Don't think.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.724
Train the eyes.

04:18.757 --> 04:19.992
Find the dime in his glove.

04:20.024 --> 04:21.493
Okay I got this.

04:24.396 --> 04:25.031
Go two.

04:31.103 --> 04:33.006
He's gonna like
playing for you.

04:34.072 --> 04:35.875
All right boys, listen up.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.410
Everybody see this?

04:37.442 --> 04:38.043
Yeah.

04:38.076 --> 04:39.045
Say yes sir.

04:39.077 --> 04:40.779
Yes, sir!

04:41.913 --> 04:43.783
Can anybody tell
me what it is?

04:43.815 --> 04:44.849
It's a rabbit.

04:44.882 --> 04:46.519
Wrong.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.354
This is the enemy.

04:49.754 --> 04:52.925
I want you to imagine that
this little floppy eared demon

04:52.958 --> 04:54.927
has hit your mother in the head.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.895
He stole her carrots
and he's run away.

04:56.928 --> 04:59.931
And the only thing that you've
got to stop him with is this.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.769
Now I want you to
take a couple steps

05:03.802 --> 05:05.371
and I want you to throw
as hard as you can

05:05.403 --> 05:08.440
and bean this little
sucker in the head.

05:08.473 --> 05:09.074
Can you do that?

05:09.108 --> 05:09.942
Yes, sir!

05:12.076 --> 05:13.612
No laughing!

05:14.446 --> 05:15.948
I need warriors.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.582
Who wants to kill the rabbit?

05:17.615 --> 05:19.418
Yeah!

05:19.451 --> 05:20.386
Okay, come over here.

05:20.418 --> 05:21.653
Take a couple steps.

05:21.687 --> 05:23.889
Take a couple steps
and hit the rabbit.

05:23.922 --> 05:25.391
All right, one more time.

05:28.726 --> 05:29.527
Come on, Tank.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.395
Come on, Tank.

05:30.428 --> 05:31.529
Here you go buddy.

05:31.562 --> 05:32.464
Take two steps.

05:32.497 --> 05:34.132
Take two steps and throw.

05:34.165 --> 05:35.999
Better.

05:36.935 --> 05:38.004
You got it in you.

05:39.036 --> 05:40.839
All right, next time.

05:40.872 --> 05:41.873
Yay!

05:42.908 --> 05:44.843
One more time, here you go.

05:46.745 --> 05:47.545
Oh!

05:48.747 --> 05:49.848
Everybody put their hands
together for that young man.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.386
We're gonna eat
rabbit stew tonight.

05:53.418 --> 05:54.120
Try it again.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.756
We're gonna eat rabbit stew.

05:58.490 --> 06:01.394
All the way, smudge it down.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.694
Do you like it?

06:03.728 --> 06:06.564
You are gonna look so scary.

06:06.598 --> 06:08.867
You're gonna look like
a bunch of wild Indians.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.502
We're not the Indians,
we're the Flash.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.704
Oh, I know.

06:12.904 --> 06:13.938
Let's see.

06:13.971 --> 06:14.973
Oh yeah, looks good.

06:17.442 --> 06:18.144
You ready to go?

06:19.845 --> 06:20.846
Yeah.

06:20.879 --> 06:21.947
Yeah?

06:21.980 --> 06:24.016
All right boys, let's
gather up, let's gather up!

06:26.517 --> 06:28.052
You guys look awesome.

06:28.086 --> 06:29.422
Hats off.

06:29.454 --> 06:30.423
Bow your hearts.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.993
Dear Lord, I ask your
blessing on these boys.

06:35.026 --> 06:37.062
Make them as tough on the inside

06:37.095 --> 06:38.931
as they look on the outside.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.031
Amen.

06:40.064 --> 06:40.966
Amen.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.600
All right, get your gloves.

06:42.634 --> 06:45.104
Let's go, let's go scare
some six year olds!

06:45.137 --> 06:46.572
Yeah!

06:46.605 --> 06:47.605
Yeah, let's go scare
some six year olds.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.224
Come on, run run run!

08:46.091 --> 08:47.927
Give me your attention.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.894
Now, if you're thinking,

08:49.927 --> 08:53.865
you can only do
40 things at once.

08:53.899 --> 08:55.768
But if you're playing wild,

08:55.801 --> 08:59.338
your subconscious can do
11 million things at once.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.706
Like when you're dreaming.

09:01.740 --> 09:02.674
What's better?

09:02.707 --> 09:03.942
11 million or 40?

09:03.975 --> 09:05.644
11 million.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.812
Brad, my math wiz.

09:07.846 --> 09:10.149
All right, so the question is,

09:10.182 --> 09:12.317
how do we tap into
our subconscious?

09:14.251 --> 09:16.087
Everybody close your eyes.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.956
Put your gloves down.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.760
Now I want you to listen
and find the smallest sound.

09:26.631 --> 09:27.299
What do you hear?

09:29.999 --> 09:30.869
- A car.
- A lawnmower.

09:30.902 --> 09:32.972
A car, a lawnmower, okay.

09:33.004 --> 09:33.938
Which one?

09:33.971 --> 09:35.173
The smallest one.

09:35.206 --> 09:36.008
Ben's stomach.

09:38.176 --> 09:39.345
That's not small, have
you seen the boy eat?

09:42.380 --> 09:43.848
Chance, what do you hear?

09:45.082 --> 09:46.651
Birds.

09:46.684 --> 09:47.885
Birds.

09:47.918 --> 09:49.888
I hear birds.

09:49.921 --> 09:51.023
Good.

09:51.056 --> 09:51.824
Everybody open your eyes.

09:51.856 --> 09:52.857
Pick up your gloves.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.795
From now on, when I say birds,

09:56.827 --> 10:00.966
the only thing you see in
the world is a baseball.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.334
No thinking.

10:02.366 --> 10:03.935
Block out everything else.

10:03.969 --> 10:05.971
Even our girlfriends?

10:08.907 --> 10:10.109
You're six years old,

10:10.142 --> 10:11.410
you're not allowed
to have girlfriends.

10:12.376 --> 10:13.846
All right, how many popups

10:13.879 --> 10:15.813
do you think you guys
can catch in a row?

10:15.846 --> 10:16.948
- 30.
- 20.

10:16.981 --> 10:17.982
- 11!
- 50!

10:18.984 --> 10:19.985
Think you can do 10?

10:20.018 --> 10:20.985
Yeah!

10:21.019 --> 10:21.986
Yeah?

10:22.019 --> 10:22.888
Don't mislead me now.

10:22.921 --> 10:23.922
Mm-hm.

10:23.955 --> 10:25.691
You think you can do 20?

10:25.724 --> 10:26.359
Yeah!

10:28.025 --> 10:31.029
Okay, let's see how many
we can do in a row, let's go.

10:32.264 --> 10:33.966
- There you go.
- 18!

10:35.801 --> 10:36.701
19!

10:36.735 --> 10:37.970
Come on boys!

10:40.205 --> 10:41.173
20!

10:46.745 --> 10:48.813
The play's made
on the first step.

10:48.846 --> 10:51.115
Drop, step, turn and burn!

10:51.149 --> 10:52.017
Here it comes.

10:52.049 --> 10:53.718
Ready.

10:53.751 --> 10:54.919
Set.

10:54.952 --> 10:56.087
First guy go.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.693
Ready.

11:01.726 --> 11:02.894
Set.

11:02.927 --> 11:03.995
First guy go.

11:09.067 --> 11:09.969
Hey guys, hustle in.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.037
You all know Coach Anthony?

11:12.070 --> 11:14.006
What's up boys?

11:14.038 --> 11:15.206
What's up, Anthony?

11:15.240 --> 11:17.275
I'm paying him to put up
with you studs for the summer.

11:17.308 --> 11:19.043
Anthony, go long.

11:19.076 --> 11:19.912
Yes sir.

11:22.346 --> 11:23.148
Oh oh oh.

11:23.181 --> 11:24.083
Nice.

11:24.115 --> 11:25.918
Woo!

11:25.951 --> 11:27.920
Like a puma, boys!

11:27.952 --> 11:29.822
What do you think of
your hustling coach?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.223
I like it.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.057
Slap me bacon.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.725
Yeah baby.

11:33.759 --> 11:34.460
Slap the bacon, that's
what we're talking about,

11:34.493 --> 11:35.160
you know what I'm saying?

11:35.192 --> 11:36.028
Yeah.

11:36.061 --> 11:37.296
All right, let's go.

11:37.328 --> 11:38.896
Play wild.

11:38.929 --> 11:41.833
You're gonna make
mistakes, make them quick.

11:41.866 --> 11:43.267
Not gonna kill you.

11:43.301 --> 11:45.471
Come on guys, you're killing me!

11:45.504 --> 11:47.940
Three seconds, first step.

11:47.972 --> 11:49.741
Coming at you hard.

11:59.183 --> 12:00.251
You're out!

12:03.455 --> 12:04.523
There you go!

12:04.556 --> 12:06.325
Hustle in, hustle in!

12:08.225 --> 12:09.961
Oh man, seriously?

12:09.995 --> 12:11.029
What's up guys?

12:11.962 --> 12:13.899
Chance has to retake
the fifth grade.

12:13.932 --> 12:15.433
Chance failed fifth grade?

12:15.466 --> 12:17.034
That stinks man.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.537
We won't be in
the same classes.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.472
- Yeah.
- You know what this means,

12:20.504 --> 12:21.939
don't you?

12:21.972 --> 12:22.807
What?

12:22.841 --> 12:23.775
It means you're dumb.

12:23.808 --> 12:25.144
You're officially dumb.

12:25.177 --> 12:26.345
I'm not dumb.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.346
That's what it
says in the letter.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.346
No it doesn't.

12:28.379 --> 12:29.981
Now wait a minute.

12:30.014 --> 12:31.783
Maybe he's not dumb,
maybe he's just dyslexic.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.085
No, definitely dumb.

12:33.118 --> 12:34.820
Well maybe he has ADHD.

12:34.852 --> 12:36.454
Yeah, one of my
friends has that.

12:36.488 --> 12:38.357
Yeah, and your
friend's really dumb.

12:38.389 --> 12:39.290
Shut up.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.060
Balls on tee.

12:45.062 --> 12:46.097
Ready.

12:48.066 --> 12:49.067
Set.

12:50.568 --> 12:51.536
First guy go.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.051
Hey Anthony, take over.

13:07.085 --> 13:08.120
Yup.

13:09.587 --> 13:10.488
Balls on tee.

13:13.390 --> 13:14.526
First guy go.

13:20.498 --> 13:22.134
Balls on tee.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.269
- Set.
- Hey buddy.

13:26.004 --> 13:27.172
What's wrong.

13:27.205 --> 13:28.139
I got held back.

13:31.275 --> 13:33.077
They were teasing me on the bus.

13:34.312 --> 13:36.514
Red, get the fellas
in here on the hop.

13:36.548 --> 13:37.817
Come on guys.

13:39.049 --> 13:40.051
Hustle in!

13:45.090 --> 13:47.192
Chance isn't gonna be
in your class next year.

13:48.659 --> 13:49.495
That hurts.

13:51.129 --> 13:54.600
What hurts more,
is his teammates.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.470
His buddies, teasing
him on the bus.

13:59.671 --> 14:01.105
It's a fine line between

14:01.139 --> 14:02.975
messing with somebody
and hurting them.

14:04.174 --> 14:05.577
Back to work, be brothers.

14:11.615 --> 14:13.384
Coach, I don't
ever tease Chance.

14:14.519 --> 14:16.221
The thought never
entered my mind.

14:21.458 --> 14:22.260
Hey.

14:25.363 --> 14:27.165
You know one of the good
things about being held back

14:27.197 --> 14:30.436
is you'll be a year older
than all your classmates.

14:31.602 --> 14:33.237
Nobody will be able
to mess with you.

14:33.270 --> 14:34.072
Really?

14:35.340 --> 14:36.175
Yeah.

14:38.475 --> 14:41.046
What's your least
favorite subject?

14:41.078 --> 14:42.246
Math I guess.

14:42.279 --> 14:43.180
Do you like your teacher?

14:43.214 --> 14:44.283
She's a monster.

14:46.317 --> 14:49.453
How do you get good at
anything in Flash baseball?

14:49.486 --> 14:52.123
Millions of reps.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.959
Millions of reps.

14:56.061 --> 14:56.896
Back to work.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.002
One, two, three go.

15:04.034 --> 15:05.370
Two, three go.

15:05.403 --> 15:06.538
Two, three go.

15:06.571 --> 15:07.940
Two, three go.

15:07.972 --> 15:09.507
Two, three go.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.442
Two, three go.

16:12.669 --> 16:13.504
Go.

16:23.615 --> 16:27.786
Here it comes, Ben.

16:27.818 --> 16:30.421
Nothing hits the ground.

16:42.067 --> 16:42.701
Speaks!

16:43.768 --> 16:45.037
Get up there.

16:49.173 --> 16:51.342
You're killing me, Speaks!

17:33.884 --> 17:35.086
Who's that?

17:35.119 --> 17:37.254
I heard they call him Big Mac.

17:37.288 --> 17:38.856
My dad says he's 11 years old.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.226
Only on hi
fake birth certificate.

17:41.259 --> 17:42.259
I hope he can pitch.

17:42.292 --> 17:43.461
We need more pitching.

17:43.494 --> 17:44.829
Yeah.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.230
What's up runt.

17:46.263 --> 17:48.299
Mess with me and
I'll snap your twig.

17:51.269 --> 17:52.270
Well he's fun.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.109
Pitch.

18:00.345 --> 18:01.246
Pitch.

18:01.278 --> 18:02.580
Find it, find it, dime, find it.

18:03.815 --> 18:04.650
Rabbit.

18:06.416 --> 18:07.785
Good, good.

18:07.818 --> 18:08.619
Rabbit.

18:10.154 --> 18:10.788
Pitch.

18:11.722 --> 18:13.424
Come on, come on Chance,
come on, come on.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.392
Rabbit.

18:14.424 --> 18:15.259
Hit it.

18:16.193 --> 18:17.596
Pitch.

18:17.628 --> 18:18.496
Don't round it off, go
straight back to the rubber.

18:18.529 --> 18:19.697
Rabbit.

18:19.730 --> 18:21.165
Straight back to the rubber.

18:21.199 --> 18:22.400
Oh!

18:22.432 --> 18:23.535
He got the ball,
that's a first.

18:23.567 --> 18:24.536
Good throw, Ben.

18:24.568 --> 18:25.903
Somebody finally hit it.

18:25.936 --> 18:27.771
Yeah, it's about time.

18:38.415 --> 18:39.317
There we go.

18:39.349 --> 18:40.618
I want a!

18:40.652 --> 18:41.853

18:44.521 --> 18:45.890

18:45.923 --> 18:47.291

18:47.325 --> 18:48.692

18:50.295 --> 18:52.364
Hey hey, aye, none of that.

18:52.396 --> 18:55.166
Why you cramping
our style, Coach Mike?

18:58.536 --> 19:01.373
- Come on, Eric.
- Let's go, Eric.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.781
Get outta there!

19:14.952 --> 19:16.922
Big Mac, my RBI king.

19:31.501 --> 19:32.803
He's not watching.

19:32.836 --> 19:34.271
Get his hands.

19:34.305 --> 19:36.408
Stop stop stop, or I
won't wanna watch it.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.241
Come on boy.

19:37.275 --> 19:37.976
What the hell?

19:38.009 --> 19:40.278
Do this the hard way, huh?

19:40.310 --> 19:45.317
Come on, get off me!

19:50.587 --> 19:51.489
Oh here we go.

19:51.521 --> 19:52.523
Oh his head's open.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.607
Three points!

20:10.741 --> 20:12.877
Hey, you guys wanna
go walk around?

20:13.944 --> 20:14.778
Why?

20:14.811 --> 20:15.713
I don't know.

20:15.747 --> 20:16.949
It's kind of spooky outside.

20:26.857 --> 20:27.892
- Oh!
- Oh yeah.

20:27.924 --> 20:29.228
Promising.

20:44.976 --> 20:48.980
Come on guys,
you're missing, come on.

20:49.012 --> 20:49.814
Come on.

21:01.392 --> 21:03.327
Come on, it's out here.

21:07.832 --> 21:10.936
He's got these two huge
dogs that rumble the house.

21:12.069 --> 21:12.971
Watch this.

21:26.049 --> 21:27.418
I'm so sorry, I mean really

21:27.451 --> 21:28.553
they are just young boys though.

21:28.586 --> 21:29.788
Did I really 'cause any harm.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.822
I mean, these kids
are outta control.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.658
This is a hate crime.

21:34.692 --> 21:35.859
I'm calling the cops.

21:35.893 --> 21:36.995
Okay you know, it's
not a hate crime,

21:37.028 --> 21:38.462
'cause you're an old white guy.

21:38.496 --> 21:39.831
They're gonna go
over there right now.

21:39.864 --> 21:41.333
Come on guys, we're
gonna go clean it up.

21:41.365 --> 21:41.967
- Now.
- Ow.

21:43.601 --> 21:45.704
Don't do this again,
I cannot deal with him.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.573
- Yeah Chance!
- Let's go.

21:48.605 --> 21:52.042
- Right there, Chance.
- Rip the ball here Chance.

21:52.076 --> 21:55.747
Hey come on

21:55.779 --> 21:56.980
Hey get us

21:57.013 --> 21:58.382
Come on kid, let's go.

21:58.415 --> 22:01.086
Come on
kid, you can do it.

22:07.657 --> 22:10.527
Shake it
off, shake it off.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.630
Come on bud, come on bud.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.598
Get us started here Chance.

22:14.632 --> 22:16.401
- Come on.
- You got it Chance.

22:16.433 --> 22:19.069
Big hit,
big hit, let's go.

22:20.805 --> 22:22.908
Go go go go go!

22:27.912 --> 22:28.913
Good job buddy.

22:28.945 --> 22:30.081
Good job Chance.

22:33.683 --> 22:35.019
Chance, have a seat.

22:35.051 --> 22:36.887
Speaks, rover to center.

22:38.021 --> 22:38.889
I'm fine.

22:38.923 --> 22:39.790
You're done.

22:39.824 --> 22:41.026
Your team's got you covered.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.962
Coach probably put
you on the DL, huh?

22:44.996 --> 22:46.965
Now are you still hitting
or are we taking him out.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.633
No, he's not hitting.

22:48.665 --> 22:49.934
His back needs a rest.

22:51.568 --> 22:52.736
Okay, no bueno.

22:52.769 --> 22:54.972
You're all right buddy,
we'll pick you up.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.875
Hey two, three, four to
start us off out there.

22:56.907 --> 22:57.942
Here we go D.

23:01.945 --> 23:05.750
Um, I'm thinking we need
to shut him down for a while.

23:05.782 --> 23:08.753
Maybe two weeks until his
back has completely healed.

23:10.121 --> 23:11.489
Hey, thank you.

23:11.521 --> 23:13.490
Thank you, goodnight.

23:13.523 --> 23:14.191
Goodnight.

23:14.224 --> 23:15.025
Night.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.863
All right, hey, who wants
to go to Dairy Barn, huh?

23:22.767 --> 23:24.068
What's going on?

23:26.837 --> 23:28.038
Hello?

23:28.071 --> 23:28.906
Mike.

23:29.874 --> 23:30.909
Chance?

23:31.909 --> 23:32.744
Am I cut?

23:34.912 --> 23:36.815
What, no.

23:36.847 --> 23:38.015
Chance, you'll never be cut.

23:38.048 --> 23:39.716
You came with the farm.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.220
You're part of the family,
I just need you to heal.

23:42.252 --> 23:43.954
I need you for the tournament.

23:43.988 --> 23:45.657
I just want to play.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.625
There's nothing to
do without baseball.

23:49.259 --> 23:50.895
Why don't you try sleeping?

23:52.063 --> 23:53.098
You know what time it is?

23:55.066 --> 23:56.167
2:00 AM.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.568
Yeah.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.203
I'm sorry.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.137
Were you sleeping?

24:01.506 --> 24:03.074
I'm never sleeping
when you call.

24:04.275 --> 24:05.610
I love you man.

24:05.643 --> 24:08.078
Heal, go to sleep, heal, heal.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.029
All right, Fury's
in the semifinals.

26:39.063 --> 26:40.031
- Yes.
- Okay.

26:40.064 --> 26:42.767
Midland beat the River
Rats, what a shocker.

26:42.799 --> 26:44.201
They've only allowed one run.

26:44.234 --> 26:45.402
That's all right,
they wasted their ace

26:45.435 --> 26:47.038
in the quarterfinals anyway.

26:47.070 --> 26:50.173
Aye, Fury beats the Bulls,
we take of business,

26:50.207 --> 26:51.342
we're in the
championship all right.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.276
Let's go handle
business, let's go.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.882
Here we go boys.

26:57.914 --> 27:02.921
Here we go CJ.

27:04.387 --> 27:05.389
Let's see.

27:11.695 --> 27:13.664
Come on, come on now.

27:13.698 --> 27:17.102
Put a good swing on,
put a good swing on.

27:45.962 --> 27:47.964
Down, down, down, down.

27:47.998 --> 27:50.101
He's out!

27:59.977 --> 28:01.913
What was that?

28:01.945 --> 28:03.380
Hm?

28:03.413 --> 28:05.983
You flinched, what happened?

28:07.017 --> 28:08.251
Listen to me with your eyes.

28:08.285 --> 28:09.120
What's wrong?

28:10.086 --> 28:12.056
Nobody else even comes
close to that ball.

28:12.088 --> 28:14.991
I'm talking to anybody
else, I'm talking to Chance.

28:15.025 --> 28:16.861
Chance is gonna play
Division 1 baseball,

28:16.894 --> 28:19.963
and Chance makes that
catch in his sleep.

28:21.065 --> 28:22.033
Make the catch.

28:27.238 --> 28:29.006
- Let's go team.
- Let's go CJ.

28:35.145 --> 28:37.815
All right, come on
back, come on back.

28:37.847 --> 28:40.084
Come on, hey, keep an eye on
him down there at third base.

28:40.116 --> 28:42.920
Keep an eye down there,
let's go now, come on.

28:42.952 --> 28:43.988
All right buddy.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.257
This guy's lights out.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.925
First movement, walk in lead.

28:51.028 --> 28:52.764
Come on
bud, we got this.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.030
- We got this.
- Pound the ball bud.

28:54.064 --> 28:57.468
Base hit.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.402
Let's go buddy.

28:58.434 --> 28:59.903
Let's go buddy, you got it.

29:06.977 --> 29:08.211
Behind you!

29:08.244 --> 29:09.446
He's out!

29:09.480 --> 29:11.382
Damn blue,
get in the game!

29:11.414 --> 29:12.849
I can give you my
glasses if you want.

29:12.883 --> 29:13.484
That's awful!

29:13.517 --> 29:14.818
What's your day job?

29:14.852 --> 29:16.120
Parents!

29:16.153 --> 29:17.288
Let me do the coaching.

29:19.957 --> 29:22.160
Hey Chance, does Mike
think you were safe?

29:22.192 --> 29:23.094
I was safe.

29:23.126 --> 29:24.028
That's not what I asked.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.829
I said do I think you were safe?

29:25.863 --> 29:27.565
You should think I was safe.

29:27.597 --> 29:28.965
I do think you were safe.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.001
Am I wearing an umpire's outfit?

29:31.035 --> 29:32.036
No.

29:32.068 --> 29:33.003
No.

29:33.037 --> 29:33.872
Let's play ball.

29:35.405 --> 29:37.841
Congrats to our runners
up, Flash baseball.

30:23.487 --> 30:25.355
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.558
You mind if I say a
few words to your team?

30:29.326 --> 30:31.062
You all know Chris Welsh.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.230
He's a former major
league pitcher.

30:33.263 --> 30:35.498
Announcer for the reds.

30:35.531 --> 30:36.666
Guys, I wanna congratulate you

30:36.700 --> 30:40.605
on how you handled that bad
call at the plate, classy.

30:40.637 --> 30:43.340
You set a great example
for both of our teams.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.876
Thanks Chris,
that means a lot.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.980
We created this place
to be something special.

30:49.012 --> 30:50.380
Never argue with the umps,

30:50.413 --> 30:53.049
always treat everyone
with respect.

30:53.083 --> 30:55.119
Well, that's very rare.

30:55.152 --> 30:56.354
Hey good luck to you guys.

30:56.386 --> 30:57.554
Thanks Chris.

30:57.587 --> 30:59.289
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

31:05.028 --> 31:06.430
Really?

31:06.462 --> 31:08.231
You never heard of the greatest
pitching duel of all time.

31:08.265 --> 31:10.334
Juan Marichal
versus Warren Spahn.

31:10.366 --> 31:11.668
Righty versus lefty.

31:11.701 --> 31:14.005
Both future Hall of Famers.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.640
I've heard about them
but not about the game.

31:15.673 --> 31:17.441
The game went 16 innings.

31:17.473 --> 31:19.676
Both pitchers threw
complete games.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.979
Marichal threw 227 pitches

31:22.011 --> 31:24.981
and Spahn threw 201.

31:25.015 --> 31:25.983
Actually?

31:26.016 --> 31:26.951
Actually.

31:27.951 --> 31:30.421
Juan's manager wanted
to take him out after 14

31:30.453 --> 31:31.923
because of pitch count.

31:31.955 --> 31:34.424
Marichal points
at Spahn and says,

31:34.458 --> 31:36.394
that guy is 42 years old,

31:36.426 --> 31:39.096
I'm 25 and I'm not ready
for you to take me out.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.165
Who won?

31:42.132 --> 31:44.435
0-0 after 15.

31:44.468 --> 31:47.471
Spahn hangs a screw
ball to Willie Mays,

31:47.503 --> 31:48.939
the bottom of the 16th.

31:49.673 --> 31:50.473
Bam!

31:50.507 --> 31:51.308
Walk off home run.

31:52.542 --> 31:53.476
Hey what's up?

31:53.509 --> 31:55.011
Hello, sorry we're late.

31:55.045 --> 31:56.212
Ah, don't worry about it.

31:56.246 --> 31:58.282
All right boys, balls,
buckets and bags

31:58.315 --> 32:00.051
in the back of the bus.

32:00.084 --> 32:00.685
Let's go.

32:03.086 --> 32:05.189
I told Chance not
to drive you crazy.

32:05.221 --> 32:06.057
Why stop now.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.459
Did you know him and Bam

32:09.492 --> 32:10.994
won the best friends
award at school?

32:11.028 --> 32:12.229
You're kidding me?

32:12.261 --> 32:14.097
Mm-hm, best friends
in the whole school.

32:14.131 --> 32:15.166
That's awesome.

32:16.165 --> 32:17.100
Drive safe.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.169
Thanks.

32:26.009 --> 32:26.644
Hey Mike?

32:26.676 --> 32:27.477
Yeah?

32:27.510 --> 32:28.346
Are you rich?

32:30.047 --> 32:31.449
Why do you ask that?

32:31.481 --> 32:33.283
'Cause you got all
the baseball stuff.

32:35.051 --> 32:37.187
The old book says,
wherever your heart is,

32:37.221 --> 32:39.356
there your treasure
will be also.

32:39.390 --> 32:43.094
My heart's in you and you
guys need baseball stuff, so.

32:43.126 --> 32:45.663
So, does that make me
like your treasure, too?

32:45.695 --> 32:46.496
- Aw.
- Aw.

32:47.364 --> 32:48.566
Shut up.

32:48.598 --> 32:50.067
I'm still trying to
figure out what you are.

32:51.434 --> 32:53.236
You guys ready to
get whooped on?

32:53.269 --> 32:54.404
Boo!

32:54.438 --> 32:55.673
Ooh.

32:55.705 --> 32:57.107
Hey coach, what
is this green bottle

32:57.141 --> 32:59.276
that you're always drinking?

32:59.308 --> 33:00.644
Bubbly water from France.

33:00.676 --> 33:02.445
I get it cheap at Sam's.

33:02.479 --> 33:04.215
Huh, I always
thought it was beer.

33:04.248 --> 33:05.249
Hm.

33:05.281 --> 33:07.018
We're not the Bad News Bears.

33:08.051 --> 33:09.619
Mm, ah.

33:09.653 --> 33:11.087
Put your seat belts on.

33:38.848 --> 33:40.250
Whoa.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.520
- Oh my goodness.
- Give me break.

33:42.553 --> 33:44.322
All right
everybody, gather up.

33:45.855 --> 33:47.391
Got a little surprise for you.

33:47.423 --> 33:49.225
Here's five dollars
for each of you.

33:49.259 --> 33:50.060
Thank you.

33:50.094 --> 33:51.295
Here's the rules,

33:51.327 --> 33:54.531
keep your voices down,
everybody stay together,

33:54.565 --> 33:57.802
no running in the hallways,
and be civilized in the pool.

34:41.844 --> 34:43.580
When I say played perfect,

34:43.614 --> 34:45.483
what is it that you
think that I mean?

34:46.382 --> 34:47.784
To win, to not suck.

34:47.818 --> 34:49.187
Don't say suck.

34:50.253 --> 34:52.889
Winning is a result.

34:52.922 --> 34:55.324
I'm talking about
something you can control.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.629
How many plays are
there in a game?

35:00.731 --> 35:02.766
In youth baseball we
play seven innings.

35:02.798 --> 35:05.436
That's 21 outs,
70 to 80 pitches.

35:05.469 --> 35:07.804
Unless it's Brad,
then it could be more.

35:09.472 --> 35:11.842
If you hustle for three seconds,

35:11.875 --> 35:13.409
70 to 80 pitches, 21 outs,

35:13.443 --> 35:16.647
that adds up to
about four minutes.

35:16.679 --> 35:19.416
Do you think you can
hustle for four minutes?

35:20.884 --> 35:23.786
And when I say hustle, I mean
play like your hair's on fire.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.556
Line drive coming
at you, first step,

35:25.588 --> 35:26.724
I'm gonna get it and
I'm gonna beat him.

35:26.757 --> 35:27.791
He doesn't stand a chance.

35:27.824 --> 35:28.860
We're gonna win.

35:31.762 --> 35:34.164
Every play, every pitch.

35:35.331 --> 35:37.234
Three seconds for
the entire game.

35:39.335 --> 35:41.838
You think you can give
me those four minutes?

35:41.871 --> 35:42.772
Yes sir.

35:44.474 --> 35:47.344
Today you're playing the best
team we've played all year.

35:47.376 --> 35:48.579
The state champions.

35:48.612 --> 35:50.713
Won every tournament
they've played in.

35:50.746 --> 35:52.149
We might get spanked.

35:52.849 --> 35:54.385
But we can't control that.

35:55.786 --> 35:58.155
What we can control is the
way that we take the field.

35:59.289 --> 36:00.691
The way that we hustle
to our positions.

36:00.724 --> 36:02.426
The way that we
take our at-bats.

36:02.458 --> 36:05.395
The way we clean the
dug out after the game.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.932
That's what I'm talking about
when I say play perfect.

36:10.934 --> 36:11.736
I'm excited.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.439
We will not be
out-hustled today.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.876
Yeah, let's pray.

36:21.644 --> 36:24.215
Dear Lord, I ask you
to give these boys

36:24.248 --> 36:25.883
the heart of a warrior.

36:25.916 --> 36:27.451
Make them as strong
on the inside

36:27.483 --> 36:29.420
as they are on the outside.

36:29.452 --> 36:30.688
In Jesus name, amen.

36:30.721 --> 36:31.556
Amen.

36:33.456 --> 36:35.458
Blood on the
battlefield today boys.

36:36.626 --> 36:38.262
Clean this place up perfect.

36:50.974 --> 36:51.875
Strike!

36:55.711 --> 36:56.547
O-2!

36:58.882 --> 37:00.351
Let's go Brad.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.987
What do
you say here, kid?

37:09.726 --> 37:10.661
Strike three!

37:10.693 --> 37:11.996
Hey hey, good pitch!

37:12.028 --> 37:14.398
Welcome to K-Mart,
can I help you?

37:14.431 --> 37:15.633
No thanks, just looking.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.969
Here we go, here
we go, ball ball.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.306
Let's go one, let's go!

37:22.338 --> 37:24.875
Right here bud, let's go.

37:24.907 --> 37:25.742
Go two eight.

37:35.552 --> 37:37.887
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

37:39.889 --> 37:41.557
Hit the deck!

37:41.590 --> 37:42.425
Safe!

37:42.458 --> 37:43.393
What?

37:43.427 --> 37:45.028
Are you kidding me blue?

37:45.061 --> 37:46.730
He was out!

37:46.762 --> 37:48.331
He was safe the whole time!

37:48.364 --> 37:49.832
I told him to run.

37:49.865 --> 37:51.668
Yeah I told him to run.

37:51.702 --> 37:52.970
That was the signal.

37:53.003 --> 37:54.605
Right boys, we gotta
hold them here!

37:54.637 --> 37:55.905
Nothing hits the ground!

37:55.938 --> 37:57.707
Aye,
four hole, four hole!

38:03.413 --> 38:05.481
Go go go go go go!

38:05.514 --> 38:06.382
Come on Chance.

38:15.025 --> 38:16.327
That a boy!

38:25.936 --> 38:28.072
Hey nice route, Magellan!

38:28.105 --> 38:28.972
That's it, that's it.

38:29.005 --> 38:29.940
Good job, good job.

38:37.581 --> 38:38.481
Let's go four four.

38:43.018 --> 38:44.854
Strike two!

38:50.893 --> 38:52.962
See that gap in right center?

38:52.996 --> 38:54.664
Yeah.

38:54.697 --> 38:57.967
I want you to hit the ball
right in that hole, all right?

38:58.001 --> 39:00.638
You see your line drive
splitting those two players?

39:01.972 --> 39:02.906
Do you really see them?

39:02.938 --> 39:03.973
Yes sir.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.710
Look at me.

39:06.742 --> 39:07.945
All right.

39:07.978 --> 39:09.380
Let's
go, come on Paul.

39:09.413 --> 39:11.748
Let's go four four.

39:18.088 --> 39:18.889
Hey!

39:38.208 --> 39:39.576
Strike!

39:51.021 --> 39:51.789
Strike!

40:03.934 --> 40:04.969
Birds.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.184
Go go go go go!

40:49.512 --> 40:50.114
Hey.

40:51.514 --> 40:52.115
Hey.

40:53.782 --> 40:55.152
What's with the long face?

40:55.184 --> 40:57.121
I just can't believe
baseball's over.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.657
Oh man, you're really sick.

41:01.690 --> 41:03.826
You know how few
kids get to play

41:03.860 --> 41:05.796
that much baseball in a season?

41:05.829 --> 41:08.999
When I was young I was lucky
to play 20 games in a season.

41:09.032 --> 41:11.001
Well, when you were young

41:11.034 --> 41:12.702
baseball hadn't
been invented yet.

41:18.074 --> 41:19.009
That's not funny.

41:21.010 --> 41:23.079
Here, game ball.

41:23.112 --> 41:24.147
Congratulations.

41:27.751 --> 41:28.619
Give me hugs man.

41:48.804 --> 41:50.840
Oh yeah, that
breeze feels good.

41:56.079 --> 41:57.681
Woohoo!

41:57.713 --> 41:58.516
I got him.

42:02.751 --> 42:04.054
Home run!

42:04.086 --> 42:04.887
Ooh!

42:04.920 --> 42:06.823
Chance goes dong.

42:07.990 --> 42:08.791
Why didn't you hit
that ball in the game?

42:08.824 --> 42:11.761
I would if Anthony
was pitching.

42:13.096 --> 42:15.065
Coach I'm done,
this is stupid.

42:15.097 --> 42:17.735
Carl, if it's so
easy you go pitch.

43:23.967 --> 43:27.637
Dang Speaks, this is
like a fish genocide.

44:02.105 --> 44:04.041
Looks like whipped cream.

44:04.074 --> 44:07.010
That's it, yeah, or
hairspray in the letter.

44:07.043 --> 44:09.113
Actually, uh, pass me
a drink real quick.

44:10.112 --> 44:11.815
Seems like a bet or something.

44:13.949 --> 44:15.152
Thanks.

44:15.184 --> 44:15.951
Talking to your
new girlfriend?

44:15.985 --> 44:17.187
No.

44:17.219 --> 44:18.721
Man, even when she's
not here, she's here.

44:18.755 --> 44:19.356
No.

44:19.389 --> 44:20.190
No?

44:20.222 --> 44:21.123
Okay, I'm sorry.

44:21.157 --> 44:22.292
Brook wants me to take her

44:22.324 --> 44:23.793
to the tanning
place for fair week.

44:23.827 --> 44:24.895
So I gotta.

44:24.927 --> 44:26.762
No, my old lady, she
doesn't believe in tanning.

44:26.795 --> 44:28.064
Says it messes their chakras.

44:29.965 --> 44:30.833
Their chakras, what's that?

44:30.867 --> 44:32.035
Chakras.

44:32.068 --> 44:32.869
It's like your,
it's like your vibe,

44:32.902 --> 44:34.304
your mood, your chakra.

44:34.336 --> 44:35.237
You
know what that is?

44:35.271 --> 44:36.907
I don't know what a chakra is.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.175
Guys, a chakra.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.776
Is it like a super, like an
Indian superhero or something?

44:39.809 --> 44:40.877
- No, it's not a hero.
- I like that.

44:40.909 --> 44:42.278
It's like your mood.

44:42.311 --> 44:44.213
Like that fire has a chakra.

44:44.246 --> 44:45.815
Just watch, watch the fire.

45:50.980 --> 45:52.481
- Yeah, I've had red hair.
- Oh yeah?

45:52.514 --> 45:56.552
Black hair, brown hair,
and now I'm blonde, yeah.

45:56.585 --> 45:57.653
Like what's your
natural hair color?

45:57.686 --> 46:00.356
Like, dirty blonde.

46:00.389 --> 46:01.190
Oh.

46:04.092 --> 46:04.927
Who's Colton?

46:17.340 --> 46:19.009
He was still there
but it was like,

46:19.041 --> 46:20.177
his cable box is gone.

46:31.153 --> 46:33.222
Hey, I'm, I'm Colton.

46:34.289 --> 46:36.092
I know, I'm Brooke.

46:37.059 --> 46:38.295
Have we met before?

46:38.327 --> 46:41.197
Uh, yeah you used to
date my friend Sydney,

46:41.231 --> 46:42.499
back in elementary school.

46:42.532 --> 46:43.333
Oh yeah.

46:43.365 --> 46:44.166
Yeah.

46:44.199 --> 46:45.902
Yeah that's right.

46:45.934 --> 46:47.336
How, how's she doing?

46:47.369 --> 46:49.038
Uh, she died.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.142
Wait, seriously?

46:52.175 --> 46:53.010
No.

47:00.983 --> 47:05.121
Sorry, I kinda forgot
that I met you then.

47:05.153 --> 47:07.056
Oh, no it's all good.

47:07.090 --> 47:08.592
I'm used to being forgettable.

47:12.561 --> 47:15.030
Actually, do you have
a pencil I can borrow,

47:15.063 --> 47:16.398
I only have pens.

47:16.431 --> 47:17.266
Sure.

47:21.471 --> 47:22.572
There you go.

47:23.539 --> 47:25.542
Um, try not to bite it.

47:25.574 --> 47:27.076
Wouldn't want you get cooties.

47:28.244 --> 47:30.247
Cooties I can handle, thanks.

47:36.253 --> 47:38.321
So he threw his phone out
while the car was moving?

47:38.353 --> 47:41.657
Yeah and then we had to turn
around and go look for it.

47:41.690 --> 47:42.925
That's actually hilarious.

47:44.226 --> 47:48.097
Um, I gotta go, but if I have
any questions I can text you?

47:48.130 --> 47:49.465
Yeah, that's fine.

47:49.498 --> 47:50.299
All right.

47:50.333 --> 47:51.501
- See you later.
- Bye.

47:57.974 --> 47:58.976
Hey babe.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.111
Who's that?

48:01.143 --> 48:02.411
That's Colton Hollowell.

48:02.445 --> 48:04.213
He's in my class,
do you know him?

48:04.246 --> 48:06.415
No, um, where's he from?

48:06.449 --> 48:07.284
Uh, Batavia?

48:09.385 --> 48:11.054
Why was he over here?

48:11.086 --> 48:13.456
He doesn't understand
conjunctive adverbs.

48:13.489 --> 48:15.157
What's a conjunctive adverb?

48:15.190 --> 48:17.126
Nobody knows, that's
why he was over here.

48:20.163 --> 48:23.934
Uh, I know this is
stupid to ask but,

48:23.967 --> 48:26.103
do you like, like him
or some, or something?

48:28.036 --> 48:30.506
I, I don't know
if I like like him,

48:30.539 --> 48:33.143
but we text sometimes
when you make me mad.

48:38.081 --> 48:40.216
Hey, you should see
your face right now.

48:40.248 --> 48:42.685
You are so angry.

48:42.719 --> 48:44.354
Oh my gosh, it's hilarious.

48:44.387 --> 48:45.355
No it's not.

48:45.387 --> 48:46.322
Yeah it is.

48:46.356 --> 48:48.191
- It's not.
- Yeah it is.

48:48.224 --> 48:49.326
Set it up boys.

48:52.362 --> 48:53.230
All right.

48:54.197 --> 48:56.199
You guys needs serve
first, so here we go.

48:58.166 --> 48:59.001
Beep.

49:00.268 --> 49:01.070
Mm-hm-hm.

49:03.572 --> 49:04.407
Serve it up.

49:06.409 --> 49:07.677
Yes.

49:07.710 --> 49:09.412
Yes yes.

49:11.514 --> 49:13.016
I work my
off during the day

49:13.048 --> 49:14.583
and this is how you repay me?

49:14.617 --> 49:17.687
Take it easy.

49:17.719 --> 49:19.488
All right Carl, we gotta
mount a comeback now.

49:24.260 --> 49:25.262
Ooh, good ball.

49:30.099 --> 49:31.134
Ow!

49:33.036 --> 49:33.737
Oh yeah, hit.

49:37.273 --> 49:39.710
Ha ha, 10 points to Gryffindor.

49:41.177 --> 49:42.012
Hit!

49:44.146 --> 49:45.047
Hit.

49:45.081 --> 49:45.682
Ooh.

49:45.715 --> 49:47.050
Yo, losers walk.

49:47.083 --> 49:48.084
Chance, you're up.

49:48.117 --> 49:50.186
That's all, that's
on me, that's awful.

49:51.487 --> 49:52.355
Gosh dang.

51:31.186 --> 51:32.422
Oh!

51:47.903 --> 51:49.739
Here we go
now, here we go.

51:49.771 --> 51:51.607
Jesus name, amen.

51:51.641 --> 51:52.541
Amen.

52:40.989 --> 52:41.790
Hey.

52:41.824 --> 52:42.659
Hi.

52:53.302 --> 52:54.570
Going straight to see grandma

52:54.603 --> 52:55.905
and then we gotta
stop at Kroger's.

52:57.974 --> 53:00.210
Think maybe I can
uh, spend the night?

53:00.242 --> 53:01.177
We'll see.

53:03.545 --> 53:04.780
Bub, can you not text please?

53:04.813 --> 53:06.715
I don't want to be a
billboard statistic.

53:10.253 --> 53:10.887
Colton.

53:11.954 --> 53:12.922
Yeah.

53:12.954 --> 53:13.789
Yeah, sorry.

53:25.367 --> 53:27.336
I uh, have some news I
wanted to tell you, Mike.

53:27.369 --> 53:28.605
Lay it on me bro.

53:28.637 --> 53:29.806
I've been missing you.

53:29.838 --> 53:31.840
Uh, well,

53:31.873 --> 53:33.842
first off I've got a girlfriend.

53:33.876 --> 53:34.844
Think I heard that.

53:34.876 --> 53:36.445
Girlfriend's are good.

53:36.478 --> 53:37.846
Coffee?

53:37.880 --> 53:39.382
No, I'm okay, thanks though.

53:40.682 --> 53:42.385
You haven't
developed the habit?

53:42.418 --> 53:43.920
I'm a bad influence.

53:43.952 --> 53:45.355
What's her name.?

53:45.387 --> 53:46.521
Brooke.

53:46.554 --> 53:47.489
She's a little younger than me.

53:47.523 --> 53:48.625
She goes to my school.

53:48.657 --> 53:49.458
Uh-huh.

53:49.492 --> 53:50.627
Is she nice?

53:50.659 --> 53:51.426
Yeah.

53:51.460 --> 53:52.262
She's pretty, too.

53:52.295 --> 53:53.463
Here, I'll show you.

53:53.496 --> 53:54.331
Let's have a look.

53:55.764 --> 53:58.500
Oh, she is pretty.

53:58.534 --> 54:00.570
Well I hope you
treat her precious.

54:00.603 --> 54:03.905
Keep in mind you're probably
dating somebody's future wife.

54:03.938 --> 54:05.474
Yeah, mine.

54:07.610 --> 54:09.012
How are the grades?

54:09.045 --> 54:10.780
Great.

54:10.813 --> 54:11.981
B's and a few A's.

54:12.014 --> 54:13.983
I might actually
get an A in algebra.

54:14.016 --> 54:16.552
Wow, there will be miracles.

54:16.585 --> 54:18.021
Keep it up.

54:18.054 --> 54:20.289
Show time for college coaches.

54:20.322 --> 54:21.891
We're making a
recruitment video for you

54:21.923 --> 54:25.360
and Tom House is coming
out to run a pitching camp.

54:25.393 --> 54:26.061
That's awesome, thanks.

54:26.094 --> 54:26.929
Mm-hm.

54:28.898 --> 54:31.701
You got the world
on a string, man.

54:31.733 --> 54:32.835
Focus, finish this.

54:32.867 --> 54:34.403
I will.

54:34.436 --> 54:35.271
I will.

54:38.007 --> 54:40.710
I've got something else
I, I wanted to tell you.

54:40.742 --> 54:41.376
Um,

54:44.780 --> 54:46.283
I got saved at church Sunday.

54:48.918 --> 54:49.853
That's fantastic.

54:51.519 --> 54:53.989
I had the same experience
when I was about your age.

54:54.023 --> 54:56.959
I was just sitting there
and, uh, I don't know.

54:56.992 --> 54:59.796
I just suddenly
realized it's for real,

54:59.829 --> 55:01.531
so I just went up to the altar.

55:03.699 --> 55:04.534
That's great.

55:05.501 --> 55:06.102
Hey, come on.

55:06.135 --> 55:06.970
Give me hugs.

55:14.009 --> 55:15.378
- Ow!
- Oh, man.

55:15.411 --> 55:17.113
Why do people buy
metal mailboxes?

55:17.146 --> 55:19.682
What are they trying
to do, dent our bats?

55:19.715 --> 55:20.583
Break your hands.

55:20.615 --> 55:21.550
Right, that hurt.

55:22.451 --> 55:23.853
That is garbage man.

55:23.885 --> 55:25.588
- Yeah.
- Geez Louise.

55:25.621 --> 55:26.889
What's the world coming to?

55:27.922 --> 55:29.491
Keep up crack baby.

55:29.525 --> 55:30.960
When are you gonna drive?

55:30.992 --> 55:32.994
I'm gonna drive when
we get to the street.

55:33.027 --> 55:34.730
You know
my friend Ricky?

55:34.764 --> 55:35.832
Maybe, doesn't
he go to Batavia?

55:35.864 --> 55:37.567
He used to.

55:37.599 --> 55:39.101
Now him and his family, like
they moved here to Richmond,

55:39.135 --> 55:42.071
but him and his girlfriend
were together for like a year.

55:42.103 --> 55:43.672
And then last month.

55:43.706 --> 55:44.941
Wait, no!

55:44.974 --> 55:46.576
Woohoo!

55:46.608 --> 55:48.009
Poned that mailbox!

55:48.043 --> 55:50.012
Okay dude, you're not
supposed to hit the wooden ones,

55:50.045 --> 55:50.847
what are you doing?

55:50.880 --> 55:51.881
Who cares?

55:51.914 --> 55:53.049
Want some of this?

55:53.081 --> 55:53.949
No.

55:53.983 --> 55:55.085
I'll take your half.

55:56.719 --> 55:58.086
Okay, wait, last month what?

55:58.119 --> 56:01.056
Last month she started
going out with Lance.

56:01.090 --> 56:02.425
Okay, who's Lance?

56:02.458 --> 56:04.460
That's what Reggie asked.

56:04.492 --> 56:05.927
Yo, Chuck.

56:05.960 --> 56:06.995
I know that your motor
skills have been impaired

56:07.028 --> 56:07.697
from sniffing all
those Sharpies,

56:07.730 --> 56:09.898
but can you kindly keep pace?

56:09.931 --> 56:12.701
I seriously gotta be
home in like an hour.

56:12.735 --> 56:16.005
And in like an hour we'll
like seriously be home.

56:16.038 --> 56:17.440
- Chillax.
- Dude.

56:19.708 --> 56:21.411
Okay, so what happened
with his girlfriend?

56:21.443 --> 56:22.144
Went to the
movies or something

56:22.177 --> 56:23.645
and Reggie got all depressed.

56:23.679 --> 56:24.947
His parents took him out
of school for a while

56:24.980 --> 56:26.516
because he couldn't
even eat anything.

56:26.548 --> 56:28.418
Girls can mess you up.

56:28.451 --> 56:29.686
Smack that mailbox.

56:31.987 --> 56:33.021
Dude!

56:33.956 --> 56:36.793
- No.
- Oh that was all you.

56:36.826 --> 56:37.760
I'm so happy that wasn't me.

56:37.793 --> 56:38.661
Shut up dude.

56:38.693 --> 56:40.061
You're gonna get
in so much trouble.

56:40.094 --> 56:41.663
Yeah I know I'm
gonna get in trouble.

56:41.697 --> 56:43.666
Ah, thank you.

56:43.699 --> 56:45.034
Shut up, I swear.

56:45.067 --> 56:45.867
That was funny, hey.

56:45.900 --> 56:47.002
Sorry, it was funny.

56:49.103 --> 56:54.876
And if, someone didn't
like that it was parked here.

56:54.909 --> 56:55.811
I don't know.

56:55.844 --> 56:57.413
That, like you parked it here.

56:59.581 --> 57:00.682
I don't know.

57:00.715 --> 57:03.185
I mean, who would do that?

57:05.054 --> 57:07.724
I, I don't know son.

57:09.157 --> 57:10.960
Or leave
a note or something.

57:16.498 --> 57:18.534
I thought you said
this thing's out of gas.

57:19.735 --> 57:22.905
Um, it's not out of gas?

57:22.938 --> 57:25.074
No, no, it shows like
a half a tank of gas,

57:25.106 --> 57:26.942
and it just started.

57:26.976 --> 57:28.678
Oh, um, okay.

57:28.710 --> 57:30.045
I mean I don't.

57:30.079 --> 57:31.614
I thought it was that,

57:31.646 --> 57:33.583
but I guess it could
be something else.

57:35.050 --> 57:36.252
- Okay.
- Is there like

57:36.284 --> 57:37.920
a check engine light
or something, or?

57:37.952 --> 57:38.855
Nope.

57:38.887 --> 57:39.989
Nope, nope.

57:40.021 --> 57:40.889
Why don't you get in the car?

57:41.891 --> 57:44.994
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58:06.614 --> 58:07.216
Hey baby.

58:09.552 --> 58:10.553
What's that?

58:16.692 --> 58:17.527
Uh.

58:22.264 --> 58:24.867
You didn't take
my phone, did you?

58:24.900 --> 58:25.701
No, why?

58:25.733 --> 58:26.635
It's not in here.

58:26.668 --> 58:28.538
Someone, someone took it.

58:28.570 --> 58:29.771
It's gone.

58:38.079 --> 58:39.047
Yeah, then we let you back in.

58:39.081 --> 58:40.583
Yeah, you let me back in.

58:40.615 --> 58:41.317
And we were having ice cream.

58:42.717 --> 58:43.918
Ice cream, ice
cream, like my own.

58:43.952 --> 58:45.922
You were only out
for like three minutes though.

58:48.791 --> 58:49.992
What did your
like, family say?

58:50.025 --> 58:50.925
Like what did they say?

58:50.960 --> 58:52.260
You just said, oh I
lost my flip flops.

58:52.293 --> 58:53.663
No.

58:53.695 --> 58:56.331
The guy who owns the
other house, he was um.

59:02.237 --> 59:03.106
Yeah yeah.

59:05.807 --> 59:07.175
The guy's like, this
is a hate crime.

59:07.208 --> 59:07.976
A hate crime.

59:08.010 --> 59:09.045
Yeah.

59:10.346 --> 59:12.081
And he, he was really mad.

59:13.615 --> 59:14.817
- Then I said.
- A hate crime.

59:14.849 --> 59:16.618
Oh no, yeah
he's like, how dare you?

59:25.994 --> 59:26.996
Oh, geez.

59:27.028 --> 59:28.030
Are you okay?

59:28.063 --> 59:29.030
Yeah, I'm fine.

59:29.063 --> 59:30.098
It's fine.

59:56.090 --> 59:56.891
Hello?

59:56.925 --> 59:58.227
You little slut.

01:00:13.007 --> 01:00:14.109
Uh, Miss, Miss Miller?

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:16.812
Hey, how are you?

01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:18.380
Um, I, I've been getting

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:22.051
these kinds of texts
and phone calls.

01:00:23.885 --> 01:00:27.856
There were other ones before
but, these are way worse.

01:00:27.889 --> 01:00:30.792
And you have no idea who
could have taken the phone?

01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:31.427
I, I don't know.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.894
Could have been anyone.

01:00:32.927 --> 01:00:33.996
Does anyone else have
your locker combination?

01:00:34.028 --> 01:00:35.731
No, just the two of us.

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:38.299
All right.

01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:40.436
I'll get with you
tomorrow, first thing.

01:00:40.469 --> 01:00:42.038
We'll figure this out, okay?

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:35.057
Someone has been sending
me and my girlfriend Brooke,

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:38.494
some very, very terrible notes

01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:42.264
saying that if she
doesn't dump me for them,

01:01:42.297 --> 01:01:44.733
uh, they're gonna come
to my house and kill me.

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:45.900
Saying that Chance
is cheating on me

01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:47.436
or that I'm cheating on him.

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:50.338
Uh, they stole my phone
and they're using that phone

01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.841
to send the messages to Brooke.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.976
They say that I have
sex with Colton Hollowell.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.847
And they've broken into
Brooke's locker multiple times.

01:01:59.114 --> 01:02:01.449
I'm sorry I just, I don't,
I don't really know what I'm,

01:02:01.483 --> 01:02:02.885
what to do anymore.

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:08.923
I'm just, I'm just
really scared for Chance.

01:02:08.956 --> 01:02:11.226
Whoever's doing this, just,
I just, I want them to stop.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.261
It's, it's,

01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:14.930
really stressing us out.

01:02:14.963 --> 01:02:18.134
Especially Brooke, she,
she's not handling it well,

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:19.367
as you may have seen.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.437
Um, and it's, it's
time for it to end.

01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:26.074
So if you can find whoever
did this, that'd be great.

01:02:37.853 --> 01:02:38.820
Let's go, let's go!

01:02:38.853 --> 01:02:39.489
Yeah!

01:02:44.992 --> 01:02:45.961
Come on, yeah!

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.247
Come on, let's go everyone!

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:18.019
Most of you older
guys know Tom House.

01:04:18.052 --> 01:04:18.987
But for you younger guys,

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.590
Mr House is a former
Major League pitcher.

01:04:21.623 --> 01:04:23.925
He's one of the greatest
pitching coaches

01:04:23.958 --> 01:04:24.893
in the United States.

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:28.396
He's also got a PhD
in sports psychology.

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:30.031
What does PhD mean?

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:32.268
I have no idea but I think
he's about to tell you.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.335
Piled higher and deeper.

01:04:34.369 --> 01:04:35.504
Uh-huh.

01:04:36.471 --> 01:04:38.139
He's also obviously a nut.

01:04:38.172 --> 01:04:39.641
But he's one of the
greatest influences

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:42.978
on how we do things
here at Flash baseball.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:46.581
So it's my pleasure to hand
the stage over to Mr Tom House.

01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:48.451
Thank you.

01:04:50.351 --> 01:04:51.586
Thank you very much.

01:04:51.619 --> 01:04:53.087
That's a bigger hand
than I ever received

01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:55.356
when I was pitching
in the big leagues.

01:04:55.389 --> 01:04:57.692
My job today is
to make you aware

01:04:57.726 --> 01:05:00.296
that there's nothing
wrong with failing.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:03.132
Baseball is a game of failure
coached by negative people

01:05:03.164 --> 01:05:05.199
in a misinformation environment.

01:05:05.233 --> 01:05:08.137
What you have to
realize as a youngster,

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.204
you have to learn how
to fail fast forward.

01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:12.540
You're gonna learn
more from your failures

01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:14.376
than you do from your successes.

01:05:14.409 --> 01:05:19.414
Takes 30,000 screw ups before
a baby can take two steps.

01:05:20.581 --> 01:05:22.483
What would happen
in those 30,000 reps

01:05:22.516 --> 01:05:25.721
if a dad like me said, you
suck when you try to walk.

01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:28.056
You are the worst walker
I've ever seen in my life.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.492
What would that kid be doing
when it was 34 years old?

01:05:30.525 --> 01:05:31.994
He'd still be crawling.

01:05:32.027 --> 01:05:34.996
We do the same thing
with our kids in sports.

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:38.267
We do the same things with
our kids in academics.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.970
We actually remind
them of what is wrong

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:43.072
more than we remind
them of what is right.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.606
Bozo, stand up here real quick.

01:05:45.507 --> 01:05:46.375
Bozo.

01:05:46.407 --> 01:05:47.608
Shut up.

01:05:47.641 --> 01:05:48.809
What you kids need
to do is Google Bozo,

01:05:48.842 --> 01:05:49.744
'cause nobody in the room
knows who Bozo the Clown was,

01:05:49.777 --> 01:05:50.645
here he is.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.249
All right, this is,
this is a mirror.

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.583
All right, what do you see
when you look in the mirror,

01:05:54.615 --> 01:05:55.650
ladies man?

01:05:55.684 --> 01:05:57.019
Is he a ladies man?

01:05:57.052 --> 01:05:57.987
No.
Uh-uh.

01:05:58.019 --> 01:05:58.820
- Yeah.
- You are?

01:05:58.853 --> 01:06:00.556
He says yes and
you guys say maybe.

01:06:00.588 --> 01:06:01.757
Who's, is it you that's
telling the truth or them?

01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:03.092
Somewhere in between.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.025
I always tell the truth.

01:06:04.059 --> 01:06:04.960
I'm a ladies man, all right.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:07.162
Okay, what do you
hate about baseball?

01:06:07.195 --> 01:06:09.698
Um, striking out.

01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:11.667
Okay, everybody
hates to strike out.

01:06:11.699 --> 01:06:15.169
Are you aware that you'll
learn more from making mistakes

01:06:15.202 --> 01:06:17.105
than you do from
being successful?

01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:19.775
I, sometimes it
doesn't feel that way.

01:06:19.807 --> 01:06:21.576
And the feeling
side of the equation

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.778
is why you don't see more guys
playing in the big leagues

01:06:23.811 --> 01:06:26.047
or the NBA or
whatever it might be.

01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:28.416
So, when you look at
yourself in the mirror,

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:29.650
you know who you are.

01:06:29.684 --> 01:06:31.153
Person you are, the
person you want to be,

01:06:31.186 --> 01:06:33.122
and the person that people sees.

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.256
Here's the magic.

01:06:34.289 --> 01:06:36.625
Everything you do, everything
your buddies do out here

01:06:36.657 --> 01:06:38.393
is tied to outcome.

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:39.661
You can't control outcome.

01:06:39.693 --> 01:06:41.195
You can control process.

01:06:41.228 --> 01:06:42.663
Are we still friends?

01:06:42.697 --> 01:06:43.599
Yeah.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.099
God bless you young man.

01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:46.734
Can we have a gallery clap
for him as he sits down.

01:06:47.702 --> 01:06:49.138
That's a great job, thank you.

01:06:52.173 --> 01:06:53.409
Oh hey stranger.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:54.242
Okay stop, you're gonna
mess up my platter.

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:55.777
No, I said stop, stop.

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.211
All right, my bad.

01:06:57.244 --> 01:06:59.681
Oh um, I'm gonna
go pick up Brooke.

01:06:59.713 --> 01:07:01.049
It's a little early.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.086
It's never too early
for Brooke, mama.

01:07:05.086 --> 01:07:05.788
You're welcome.

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.623
Thank you, love you.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:19.101
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:21.869 --> 01:07:24.772
So, it was just in your seat.

01:07:24.806 --> 01:07:25.807
Yeah.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.777
Um, yeah found it
after the game.

01:07:28.809 --> 01:07:30.278
How did it get into your car?

01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:31.480
I don't know.

01:07:31.512 --> 01:07:34.715
It's, it's weird.

01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:36.584
Yeah it is weird.

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:37.719
I wanted to ask you,

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:41.623
if you'd be okay with
just dropping it?

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.761
So it's out of our hands.

01:07:45.793 --> 01:07:47.695
There's not really
much we can do, so.

01:07:49.396 --> 01:07:50.799
Would you be okay with that?

01:07:55.536 --> 01:07:56.471
Yeah.

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:57.306
Yeah?

01:07:57.338 --> 01:07:58.206
Yeah.

01:07:58.239 --> 01:07:59.607
Okay, are you sure?

01:07:59.641 --> 01:08:00.876
Yeah, it's good.

01:08:00.909 --> 01:08:02.845
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:04.080
All right.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.416
Yeah
we're in a treat today.

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:08.851
If you like pitching
and if you like.

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:09.885
I'm gonna tell them.

01:08:09.918 --> 01:08:10.719
No.

01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:11.652
Yes I am.

01:08:11.686 --> 01:08:12.387
- No you're not.
- Yes I am.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.255
Yeah I am.

01:08:14.588 --> 01:08:15.523
Hi Mr Burley.

01:08:15.556 --> 01:08:16.692
- Hey.
- Hey darling.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.493
You sticking
around for the game?

01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:18.661
Uh, yeah for a while.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:21.596
My mom's husband wants me
home early on school nights.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.631
Oh, darn stepdads.

01:08:23.663 --> 01:08:24.765
Oh he's not my stepdad.

01:08:24.798 --> 01:08:27.336
My mom and my
stepdad got divorced.

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.569
What do you call
your current stepdad?

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:30.706
My mom's husband.

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:31.538
Oh.

01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:35.511
So, do you guys
want to hear a deep,

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:37.845
dark, treacherous secret?

01:08:37.877 --> 01:08:39.448
Don't do this
to me, don't do this to me.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:40.416
I'm gonna tell them.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:41.649
- Mr blondie here bet me.
- No no no no no no.

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.886
Five bucks on the Marlins.

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.185
Oh here we go.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.421
What?

01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:47.654
I know, I should
be concerned, right?

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.292
Because he's got like
no loyalty, at all.

01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:52.894
This is so weird, 'cause I,
I thought you were a Reds fan.

01:08:52.926 --> 01:08:55.529
Man, I, you know, but I also
thought you were my son,

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:56.832
and apparently
that's not the case.

01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:59.568
Okay because the
Marlins, they have um,

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.234
they have Stanton and
they have Reyes, right?

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:02.502
They've won a World Series.

01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:03.837
Oh, yeah.

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:06.175
No that's true,
like nine years ago.

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.408
- They sure.
- That doesn't matter.

01:09:07.442 --> 01:09:08.644
Plato's on the
mound today, dude.

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:09.777
Just give her five bucks.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.712
Just get it over with man,
'cause it's done, traitor.

01:09:11.746 --> 01:09:12.912
You can just pay me now.

01:09:12.947 --> 01:09:14.448
Hey if you guys want to
watch a movie before game time,

01:09:14.481 --> 01:09:16.417
there's another
TV in the bedroom.

01:09:16.451 --> 01:09:17.452
I'll make you popcorn.

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:19.621
Oh yes please, I'm starving.

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:21.524
Oh yes please
mom, I'm starving.

01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:24.894
Get off your phone.

01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:27.563
Seriously, get off it.

01:09:41.841 --> 01:09:43.711
Close your eyes.

01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:44.645
Why?

01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:45.514
Just do it.

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:57.858
What is this for?

01:09:57.891 --> 01:09:59.827
Really early Valentine's Day.

01:10:02.863 --> 01:10:04.465
Aw, you are so sweet.

01:10:04.498 --> 01:10:05.333
Thanks.

01:10:12.439 --> 01:10:14.942
I'm warning you,
I only take cash.

01:10:14.975 --> 01:10:16.612
Okay, the Reds
are not gonna win.

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:17.879
The Reds are
totally gonna win.

01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:18.914
They're not gonna win.

01:10:18.947 --> 01:10:19.981
Yes they are.

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:20.849
Okay.

01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:41.036
Hey.

01:10:41.069 --> 01:10:41.870
It's you.

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:45.539
I saw the light, thought
I'd come out to check.

01:10:45.573 --> 01:10:48.344
Sorry, I, just
felt like hitting.

01:10:50.377 --> 01:10:50.979
Don't be sorry.

01:10:52.046 --> 01:10:53.348
Let's see what you got.

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:56.852
Ah!

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.954
Firm front, lock your knee.

01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:00.521
Keep your arms in tight.

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:01.923
Stop moving your head.

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:09.797
Hey, Chance,

01:11:11.765 --> 01:11:12.600
you all right?

01:11:15.936 --> 01:11:16.704
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:16.738 --> 01:11:19.908
I'm just um,
worried about stuff.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:25.581
Well, they say 90% of what
we worry about never happens.

01:11:27.849 --> 01:11:29.518
Yeah.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:32.354
Um, I'm good, yeah.

01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:34.657
Thanks for asking.

01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:37.760
All right.

01:11:41.762 --> 01:11:44.300
Oh hey, you hear
Cueto threw a shutout?

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:49.371
That's uh, that's awesome.

01:11:49.404 --> 01:11:50.539
Yeah.

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:51.373
Great game.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.376
Don't forget to
shut the lights out.

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:04.987
You okay back there?

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:11.093
You haven't sat in
the back for years.

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.429
Since it was legal for
you to be up front.

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:16.965
Colton.

01:12:29.077 --> 01:12:29.912
Colton,

01:12:30.944 --> 01:12:31.979
what's wrong?

01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:34.416
We're taking care
of grandma, bub,

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:37.018
she's gonna get
everything she needs.

01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:37.685
It's not that.

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.456
Why are you so upset?

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:44.126
It's nothing.

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:45.894
Tell me.

01:12:49.197 --> 01:12:52.434
I had to go to the
office on Friday.

01:12:52.466 --> 01:12:54.402
Why'd you get
called to the office?

01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:58.774
The police were there.

01:12:58.806 --> 01:13:00.141
What?

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.577
Why was the police there?

01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:06.447
Let me see your phone.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.418
No.

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.153
Colton, give my your phone.

01:13:11.185 --> 01:13:12.086
No.

01:13:12.119 --> 01:13:13.154
- Colton.
- No.

01:13:14.555 --> 01:13:15.689
No.

01:13:15.722 --> 01:13:16.957
- Give me the phone.
- No, quit it.

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.759
I wanna see what's going on.

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:18.627
Quit it.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.395
- Mom.
- Is it a girl?

01:13:22.463 --> 01:13:23.097
Colton.

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:27.435
How long's this been going on?

01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:29.938
Since school started.

01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:32.807
They all been this bad?

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:35.477
They've been bad but
now they're getting worse.

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:36.744
I'm calling the police.

01:13:36.778 --> 01:13:37.945
This boy was in our driveway

01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:40.782
and in two of these messages
he's threatening your life.

01:13:40.814 --> 01:13:41.882
Who's Logan?

01:13:41.916 --> 01:13:44.119
He's one of Chance's friends.

01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:46.154
You got one from him too.

01:13:46.186 --> 01:13:48.189
Colton, do not come
out of your house.

01:13:48.222 --> 01:13:49.824
Stay in your house.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.025
Chance will kill you.

01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:57.698
You never mention this at all?

01:13:59.533 --> 01:14:00.801
I was too
scared to tell you.

01:14:05.939 --> 01:14:07.107
Sometime's he'd come up

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.876
and poke my shoulder
with his finger.

01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:11.880
He never hit me but
he'd come up and jab me,

01:14:11.912 --> 01:14:13.080
like give me a warning.

01:14:15.949 --> 01:14:18.552
He text me in class and ask
me if I was looking at Brooke.

01:14:18.586 --> 01:14:20.989
99% of everything had
to do with Brooke.

01:14:21.989 --> 01:14:24.024
He'd tell me to text her
to see if she liked me

01:14:24.057 --> 01:14:26.094
and I'd tell him no, Chance.

01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:27.596
I don't want to text her

01:14:27.628 --> 01:14:29.096
'cause you'll get
mad at me if I do.

01:14:39.573 --> 01:14:41.675
Before Chance would
text me bad messages,

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:43.945
then he'd text me some
that wouldn't be real bad.

01:14:57.024 --> 01:14:58.226
But after that heart thing,

01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:00.929
they were all bad.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.783
I couldn't come out of the
school till he got there.

01:15:21.815 --> 01:15:24.118
Chance would always hang out
by the brick thing in front.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.887
I was afraid to be
out there with him.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.306
Friday I got called
into the office

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:46.841
for writing a note
threatening to kill Chance.

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:49.978
They didn't show it to me,
the police were there though.

01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:51.279
Don't let them
take your phone.

01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:53.015
They were telling
me I could go to jail.

01:15:54.181 --> 01:15:54.983
Why'd you
write the note.

01:15:55.015 --> 01:15:56.183
I didn't.

01:15:56.216 --> 01:15:56.984
Why'd they
think you did?

01:15:57.018 --> 01:15:57.953
My name was on it.

01:15:59.953 --> 01:16:01.590
Colton, the police
will be able to tell

01:16:01.622 --> 01:16:03.791
by the handwriting
it wasn't you.

01:16:03.824 --> 01:16:06.060
Why was he even talking to
you, you're 15 years old.

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.962
The school notify
anybody's parents?

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.099
I didn't see anybody there.

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.003
Go to bed now.

01:16:15.036 --> 01:16:17.038
We'll talk about
it more tomorrow.

01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:24.110
This is Colton's mom.

01:16:24.145 --> 01:16:26.681
I looked through my son's phone
and found over 100 messages

01:16:26.713 --> 01:16:28.182
from this number
threatening him.

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:29.851
I made a copy.

01:16:29.884 --> 01:16:32.087
I'm taking these to the police
and the school tomorrow.

01:16:32.119 --> 01:16:34.622
I will find your parents
names and give them a copy.

01:16:34.655 --> 01:16:36.891
Do not text or come
near my son again.

01:16:40.261 --> 01:16:41.363
No, I.

01:16:41.395 --> 01:16:42.896
Hey, saw the light on.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:44.032
Made you something to eat.

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:46.266
Who are you talking to?

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.735
- No one.
- Is that Chance?

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.936
- No.
- Give me the phone.

01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:49.771
Look mom, wait.

01:16:49.804 --> 01:16:50.404
Give me the phone.

01:16:50.438 --> 01:16:51.239
Wait.

01:16:51.271 --> 01:16:52.940
Give me the phone.

01:16:52.974 --> 01:16:54.074
Chance?

01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:55.944
This is Nina, Colton's mother.

01:16:55.976 --> 01:16:57.045
Uh, hello ma'am.

01:16:57.078 --> 01:16:58.079
Why are you telling Colton
you're gonna kill him?

01:16:58.112 --> 01:16:59.780
Ma'am?

01:16:59.814 --> 01:17:00.782
Colton's only had one girl
in his life that he likes.

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:02.116
He has no interest in Brooke.

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:04.652
Ma'am it's, it's not that.

01:17:04.685 --> 01:17:05.987
It's knowing that she likes him.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.255
Well maybe she's
trying to cause trouble.

01:17:07.287 --> 01:17:09.023
Sometimes girls will do that.

01:17:09.923 --> 01:17:10.792
Chance I don't.

01:17:12.426 --> 01:17:13.827
Colton would be a
good friend to you.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.030
I don't understand why
you don't like him.

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.798
Ma'am, I'm, I
will never tell him

01:17:17.832 --> 01:17:19.167
I'm going to kill him again.

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:20.934
Is there something
he could do different?

01:17:20.967 --> 01:17:23.037
Something he's doing
that you don't like?

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:26.140
Colton loves his grandma.

01:17:26.173 --> 01:17:28.810
She's probably only got
a few weeks to live.

01:17:28.842 --> 01:17:30.412
Can you at least
please stop this

01:17:30.444 --> 01:17:32.880
so he can have a few weeks
of peace with his grandma?

01:17:32.913 --> 01:17:34.416
Ma'am,
I, I understand.

01:17:35.382 --> 01:17:36.217
I'm dying too.

01:17:40.887 --> 01:17:43.024
What do you mean you're dying?

01:17:43.056 --> 01:17:44.859
I have
stomach cancer.

01:17:47.328 --> 01:17:49.765
Chance, what would you
do if this was your son?

01:17:50.497 --> 01:17:52.333
Um, I, I would
call the police.

01:17:56.237 --> 01:17:57.972
Okay, uh.

01:17:59.372 --> 01:18:00.274
Okay.

01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:03.778
Chance, can I have your
parents phone number

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:05.913
so I can talk to them first?

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:07.082
What's your parent's names?

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:10.117
I called that number
and it's not your mom.

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:12.887
I, I've been
going through a lot, ma'am.

01:18:14.354 --> 01:18:17.759
My four year old nephew was
just killed in a car wreck.

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:19.094
Oh, I hate to
hear that Chance.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.829
And I, I also
just found out recently

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.463
that I have stomach cancer.

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.132
Chance, are you sure
you have stomach cancer,

01:18:24.164 --> 01:18:26.734
or are you just so upset that
your stomach hurts that bad?

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:27.969
I throw up blood every day.

01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:31.005
I, I know I have
stomach cancer and,

01:18:31.037 --> 01:18:32.172
I'm homeless right now.

01:18:32.206 --> 01:18:33.842
I, I've been living in a van
for the past three weeks.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.109
Mom.

01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:39.747
Just let him stay here.

01:18:46.253 --> 01:18:49.925
Chance, if you're homeless
we have an extra room here.

01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:53.395
Any of Colton's friends
can come here, you can eat.

01:18:56.163 --> 01:18:57.965
Can I, can I talk
to Colton again?

01:18:59.233 --> 01:19:01.036
There's no reason
for any of this.

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.172
Colton's a good kid.

01:19:05.573 --> 01:19:07.041
You're gonna have
friends a lot longer

01:19:07.073 --> 01:19:08.876
than the girl you're
with at this age.

01:19:08.909 --> 01:19:11.445
She tries to make you jealous
maybe she's not worth it.

01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:13.181
I don't know, I
don't know Brooke.

01:19:15.349 --> 01:19:16.752
Will you have him call me?

01:19:18.085 --> 01:19:18.920
I don't know.

01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:21.756
We'll see.

01:19:24.024 --> 01:19:25.059
I gotta go.

01:19:58.458 --> 01:20:00.127
Hey.

01:20:00.161 --> 01:20:00.996
Hey.

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:04.865
Just got off the
phone with Chance.

01:20:06.167 --> 01:20:08.603
Think we might
actually be friends.

01:20:08.636 --> 01:20:09.838
Not surprising.

01:20:12.573 --> 01:20:15.811
He also said that not all
those messages were from him.

01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:19.481
Someone stole his phone
and pretended to be him.

01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:21.983
And the principle knows, so.

01:20:27.654 --> 01:20:29.925
I'm gonna get some sleep.

01:20:31.158 --> 01:20:32.227
Goodnight.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.261
Goodnight.

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:52.380
Hey I'm kinda
worried about Chance,

01:20:52.412 --> 01:20:53.380
he's not been texting me.

01:20:53.413 --> 01:20:54.983
Ah, you see him at school?

01:20:56.016 --> 01:20:57.217
Well we don't have
any classes together

01:20:57.251 --> 01:20:59.287
but I see him all the
time in the halls.

01:20:59.319 --> 01:21:01.622
Guys said you're gonna
start being friends.

01:21:01.655 --> 01:21:03.425
Talk to him, see
if he's all right.

01:21:04.425 --> 01:21:06.060
Hustle up.

01:21:06.092 --> 01:21:08.296
We gotta pick up your Aunt
Crystal to go see grandma.

01:21:09.296 --> 01:21:10.898
Why aren't you parking?

01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:12.399
I have a doctor's
appointment today,

01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:14.002
so I will see you later.

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.038
See ya, love you.

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.671
Hey Speaks.

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:56.044
Have you seen Chance?

01:22:27.608 --> 01:22:29.177
Si, Colton.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:30.979
I really need to
go to the office.

01:22:32.546 --> 01:22:34.481
I need to tell them something.

01:22:34.515 --> 01:22:37.752
Well what do
you need to tell them?

01:22:37.784 --> 01:22:40.087
I can't tell you,
I can only tell them.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:42.590
Okay, well that's
incredibly informative.

01:22:42.622 --> 01:22:45.225
Can you wait until
the break please?

01:22:45.259 --> 01:22:46.493
Thank you.

01:23:13.453 --> 01:23:15.088
Can you check that?

01:23:15.122 --> 01:23:16.157
Yeah.

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.127
Oh it's from Colton.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:22.463
Mom, none of my teachers
will let me go to the office.

01:23:22.496 --> 01:23:24.231
Chance is not here today.

01:23:42.483 --> 01:23:43.784
Hello, this is
Principal Miller.

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:46.054
Hi Grace, this
is Nina Hollowell.

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:49.123
Colton's in class and he's
told every teacher this morning

01:23:49.155 --> 01:23:49.823
he's got something
important to tell you,

01:23:49.856 --> 01:23:51.525
nobody's letting him go.

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:53.194
Well, do you know what
it is he wants to tell us?

01:23:53.226 --> 01:23:55.162
Yeah, he's worried
about Chance.

01:24:02.802 --> 01:24:05.172
Shelbie, call Chancellor.

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:07.275
He just backed out
of the driveway.

01:24:07.307 --> 01:24:09.243
He wanted me to tell you
if he can't get a hold of you

01:24:09.275 --> 01:24:10.377
he's worried about himself

01:24:10.411 --> 01:24:11.679
but he's more
worried about Chance.

01:24:11.712 --> 01:24:13.114
I have spoken with the entire.

01:24:13.146 --> 01:24:15.182
He feels like Chance
might kill himself.

01:24:17.150 --> 01:24:21.688
Uh, Mrs Hollowell, we have
the situation taken care of,

01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:24.257
and I will speak
with Colton today.

01:24:24.291 --> 01:24:26.261
Thank you, that
makes me feel better.

01:24:32.832 --> 01:24:36.503
Kelly, I need you to
get Colton right now.

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.141
Hey Chancellor.

01:24:40.173 --> 01:24:41.175
Hi.

01:24:41.207 --> 01:24:42.109
Come on in.

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:42.710
Thank you.

01:24:42.743 --> 01:24:43.778
How are you?

01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:45.813
- I'm good.
- Good.

01:24:45.845 --> 01:24:47.180
Shelbie!

01:24:47.213 --> 01:24:48.682
Now I've talked to your mom

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.852
and we have the
situation taken care of.

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:53.154
Chance will not be
returning to school.

01:24:53.186 --> 01:24:54.788
He's gonna finish
his grade from home.

01:24:54.822 --> 01:24:55.623
Why?

01:24:55.655 --> 01:24:57.358
I think we might
have worked it out.

01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:59.860
No, there's too
much that's gone on.

01:25:02.195 --> 01:25:03.430
Does Chance know?

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.835
You wanna see my
homecoming pictures?

01:25:07.868 --> 01:25:08.703
Well yeah.

01:25:13.774 --> 01:25:14.642
Oh wow.

01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:17.744
Brooke's so pretty.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.749
You're not half bad yourself.

01:25:25.953 --> 01:25:28.689
Yeah I think she
likes someone else.

01:25:28.721 --> 01:25:29.823
Why do you say that?

01:25:31.391 --> 01:25:32.827
I uh, just have a feeling.

01:25:37.363 --> 01:25:38.798
Hey.

01:25:38.832 --> 01:25:40.801
I gotta go do some homework.

01:25:40.833 --> 01:25:41.667
Okay.

01:25:41.702 --> 01:25:45.140
Yeah, um, I'm just
gonna take a nap.

01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:48.909
Here.

01:25:49.810 --> 01:25:50.812
Thank you.

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:56.684
We could um, watch a
movie later if you want.

01:25:57.984 --> 01:25:59.420
I wish I was homeschooled.

01:26:00.554 --> 01:26:01.322
No you don't.

01:26:01.354 --> 01:26:02.322
Yes I do.

01:26:02.355 --> 01:26:03.190
No you don't.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:05.627
Yes I do.

01:26:22.509 --> 01:26:25.880
What was that movie
you were talking about?

01:26:33.253 --> 01:26:33.954
It's my mom.

01:26:43.296 --> 01:26:43.931
Hello?

01:26:46.734 --> 01:26:48.836
What, whoa whoa, what?

01:26:48.868 --> 01:26:49.703
No.

01:26:52.805 --> 01:26:53.640
Wait.

01:26:59.479 --> 01:27:01.848
The, the school called my mom.

01:27:02.916 --> 01:27:04.552
I'm in trouble.

01:27:04.585 --> 01:27:05.953
Well the movie's almost
over, do you wanna finish it?

01:27:05.985 --> 01:27:07.020
No I can't, I'm sorry.

01:27:07.054 --> 01:27:07.889
Thank you though.

01:27:10.524 --> 01:27:11.359
Hey.

01:27:16.329 --> 01:27:17.030
Please drive slow, okay?

01:27:17.064 --> 01:27:18.466
Text me when you get home.

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.336
Christ Hospital, fifth floor.

01:27:55.368 --> 01:27:56.737
Michelle Smith please.

01:27:56.770 --> 01:27:57.905
Is that a patient?

01:27:57.938 --> 01:27:59.539
No no, it's my
mom, she works there.

01:27:59.573 --> 01:28:00.941
They must have put you
through to the wrong floor.

01:28:00.974 --> 01:28:03.577
There's no Michelle
working here today.

01:28:03.609 --> 01:28:04.844
Let me transfer you
back to the operator.

01:28:04.877 --> 01:28:07.948
Uh, no that's okay,
I'll just call back.

01:29:35.469 --> 01:29:36.103
Hey this is Colton,

01:29:36.136 --> 01:29:37.138
leave me a message.

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:38.005
Thank you.

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:35.990
Hey, dad?

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.091
Can you drive me to school?

01:31:37.123 --> 01:31:38.626
Chance isn't answering.

01:31:44.931 --> 01:31:48.167
Destiny, maybe he's
camping in the shed.

01:31:48.201 --> 01:31:50.037
Can you go out there
and look for me?

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:04.918
Mom, don't come out here!

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:07.088
Don't let mom come out here!

01:32:23.136 --> 01:32:24.972
What's going on?

01:32:25.005 --> 01:32:26.140
What's all this?

01:32:28.007 --> 01:32:28.876
Wait wait wait, what
happened, what happened?

01:32:28.908 --> 01:32:29.976
Wait, where's Chance?

01:32:31.144 --> 01:32:33.981
He's up at Brown
County Hospital.

01:32:34.014 --> 01:32:34.782
Well come on, let's get going.

01:32:34.814 --> 01:32:35.649
I can't.

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:38.152
What, what are
you talking about?

01:32:39.619 --> 01:32:40.988
Michelle?

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.023
He's gone.

01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:46.326
What, what does
that mean Michelle?

01:32:46.359 --> 01:32:47.728
What do you mean he's gone?

01:32:52.399 --> 01:32:55.135
I know, I know, I know.

01:32:55.167 --> 01:32:56.603
I know, I know.

01:32:58.971 --> 01:33:00.139
I'm sorry.

01:33:00.172 --> 01:33:00.942
I'm sorry.

01:33:02.074 --> 01:33:05.878
No, I'm not, no no.

01:33:05.912 --> 01:33:06.747
Naw.

01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:10.184
Where's, Chance?

01:33:12.819 --> 01:33:14.320
Can I
have your attention please?

01:33:14.354 --> 01:33:16.056
This is Principle Miller.

01:33:16.088 --> 01:33:18.326
There's been a tragedy
among the student body.

01:33:19.259 --> 01:33:20.060
Chance.

01:33:20.092 --> 01:33:21.161
No!

01:33:23.095 --> 01:33:25.698
This morning, where he
was pronounced dead.

01:33:25.731 --> 01:33:28.935
We're still waiting for more
information at this time.

01:33:28.969 --> 01:33:31.038
Please keep his family in
your thoughts and prayers.

01:33:31.938 --> 01:33:32.940
Nina.

01:33:32.972 --> 01:33:33.940
Yeah, it's mine.

01:33:33.974 --> 01:33:35.809
I got it, I got it.

01:33:35.841 --> 01:33:36.911
Hello, Colton?

01:33:49.322 --> 01:33:50.224
You killed Chance!

01:34:05.137 --> 01:34:06.907
It's not your fault, bub.

01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:08.908
Yeah I know but
they don't know that.

01:34:08.942 --> 01:34:11.045
Okay, I can never
come back here.

01:34:12.479 --> 01:34:14.882
Colton, it's not your fault.

01:34:14.914 --> 01:34:16.417
I should have
just told someone.

01:34:18.051 --> 01:34:19.053
I'm sorry.

01:34:21.954 --> 01:34:24.257
I'm sorry, I should have told.

01:34:45.078 --> 01:34:46.180
I loved that boy.

01:34:47.413 --> 01:34:48.815
I know you do.

01:35:04.463 --> 01:35:06.199
Hi, my name is Mike.

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:09.235
I own the Flash baseball
complex down the road.

01:35:09.269 --> 01:35:10.804
I know who you are.

01:35:10.837 --> 01:35:12.206
My son in law played for you.

01:35:12.238 --> 01:35:13.073
Oh.

01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:15.007
You want to come in?

01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:15.842
Oh, no no.

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:16.777
No thank you.

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:18.946
I, here to ask some questions.

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.981
Try to find out what happened.

01:35:22.248 --> 01:35:23.951
I spoke to Michelle and Burley,

01:35:25.018 --> 01:35:27.855
they've given me
Chance's phone records.

01:35:27.887 --> 01:35:30.023
I just wanted to double check.

01:35:30.055 --> 01:35:31.991
Is that Colton's phone number?

01:35:33.225 --> 01:35:34.193
Yeah.

01:35:34.226 --> 01:35:35.996
Yeah.

01:35:36.029 --> 01:35:36.864
Um.

01:35:38.965 --> 01:35:40.434
When was the first
time that you knew

01:35:40.466 --> 01:35:43.036
something was going on
between the two of them?

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:47.240
I only found out when I checked
Colton's phone on Sunday.

01:35:48.908 --> 01:35:49.942
Really?

01:35:49.975 --> 01:35:51.878
Yeah, Sunday.

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.380
He said he was called to
the principal's office

01:35:53.412 --> 01:35:55.548
but they never
contacted me or nothing.

01:35:55.582 --> 01:35:57.184
They called Burley and Michelle?

01:35:58.551 --> 01:36:01.320
I thought school's were
supposed to notify you about.

01:36:01.354 --> 01:36:02.189
Yeah.

01:36:03.323 --> 01:36:06.059
Anyways, that's what
Colton feels the worst about.

01:36:06.091 --> 01:36:07.994
He never told nobody until.

01:36:11.965 --> 01:36:12.565
I'm sorry.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.002
Been really hard on Colton.

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:18.471
The kids at school saying
he did something to Chance.

01:36:22.475 --> 01:36:24.411
I'm worried about him.

01:36:24.444 --> 01:36:26.079
He mostly don't talk to me.

01:36:26.112 --> 01:36:28.047
He stays inside
his room nonstop.

01:36:29.082 --> 01:36:31.852
I read somewhere that
suicide rates go up

01:36:31.885 --> 01:36:34.320
for people who knew the
person and if he's depressed.

01:36:39.024 --> 01:36:40.259
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:36:40.292 --> 01:36:41.295
I'm sorry.

01:36:45.131 --> 01:36:48.836
That boy would cry
every time he struck out

01:36:48.868 --> 01:36:50.536
since he was six years old.

01:36:50.569 --> 01:36:53.940
I told him, you're gonna
strike out a thousand times.

01:36:56.609 --> 01:36:58.813
May as well get all
the crying done now.

01:37:04.283 --> 01:37:05.286
I loved that boy.

01:37:10.023 --> 01:37:11.057
Thank you.

01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:16.649
Hey Big Mac.

01:39:23.789 --> 01:39:25.158
Hey Anthony.

01:39:38.371 --> 01:39:40.474
Hey, we're about to start.

01:39:40.506 --> 01:39:42.041
Let's go take a
little break, okay.

01:39:42.074 --> 01:39:44.344
We can't, look at the people.

01:39:44.377 --> 01:39:45.178
We just need to get
you something to eat.

01:39:45.211 --> 01:39:46.547
I can't, just.

01:39:47.479 --> 01:39:50.082
Look at the people.

01:39:50.115 --> 01:39:53.286
You can't hug everybody
in Brown County, right?

01:39:53.319 --> 01:39:54.121
Yeah.

01:40:16.176 --> 01:40:18.212
I think we're all
asking the same question.

01:40:21.113 --> 01:40:22.148
Why?

01:40:24.751 --> 01:40:26.052
Was it something we did?

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:29.123
Something we didn't do?

01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:33.027
Was it something we
said or didn't say?

01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:36.262
We all want a reason.

01:40:40.632 --> 01:40:43.336
There's been a lot of young
men pass through the Flash.

01:40:44.404 --> 01:40:45.205
This one.

01:40:47.306 --> 01:40:48.509
This one was like a son.

01:40:51.877 --> 01:40:54.414
Over 600 games from
six years old until,

01:40:58.551 --> 01:40:59.319
his death.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.289
Chance grew up just
a few miles from here

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:05.359
and considered this
place his home.

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:08.095
It was.

01:41:08.127 --> 01:41:09.095
And always will be.

01:41:11.363 --> 01:41:13.166
He will always have family here.

01:41:16.136 --> 01:41:17.537
Chance recently shared with me

01:41:17.569 --> 01:41:20.106
that he'd received eternal
life through Christ.

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:24.845
I know that a person saved
will always have salvation,

01:41:24.877 --> 01:41:27.346
and I believe that he
is in better hands now.

01:41:28.914 --> 01:41:34.121
We especially mourn when a young
person's life is cut short.

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:38.592
But let's rejoice in this one.

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:43.430
Life filled with
enthusiasm and joy.

01:41:46.932 --> 01:41:49.168
16 years of dynamite.

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:13.187
Let's try it again.

01:43:14.253 --> 01:43:15.755
What's your name?

01:43:15.787 --> 01:43:16.589
Abe.

01:43:16.622 --> 01:43:17.823
Abe, Abraham.

01:43:17.856 --> 01:43:19.626
That's a awesome name.

01:43:19.658 --> 01:43:23.629
All right Abraham, I want you
to keep your eye on that ball.

01:43:23.662 --> 01:43:26.865
Swing with the same
energy, only this time,

01:43:26.899 --> 01:43:28.902
I want you to hit
this little dot.

01:43:31.037 --> 01:43:31.805
You see that dot?

01:43:31.837 --> 01:43:33.639
Mm-hm.

01:43:33.672 --> 01:43:36.242
I want you to hit that
dot with all your might.

01:43:38.944 --> 01:43:39.712
Nice!

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:40.581
Again.

01:43:41.881 --> 01:43:43.317
Hit that dot Abraham.

01:43:46.551 --> 01:43:47.353
That a boy.

01:43:53.893 --> 01:43:54.927
All right.

01:43:58.730 --> 01:43:59.565
Dot.

01:44:02.835 --> 01:44:04.637
You keep swinging like that
the rest of your life, Abraham.

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:06.338
You're a hitter.

01:44:06.372 --> 01:44:07.007
Next.
