WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:03.730
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.800 --> 00:04.881
Paperwork's been filed.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.167
I'll be there, all moved
in, in a few weeks.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.401
<i>Daddy's coming home</i>

00:08.480 --> 00:10.642
<i>so that mommy can
finally take a nap.</i>

00:10.720 --> 00:12.165
Does that look like rot to you?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.850
It almost looks like somebody
out the boards away.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.684
Son, you got one hell of an eye.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.330
Aah!

00:18.600 --> 00:22.491
You running from Boyd,
the law, or both?

00:22.600 --> 00:25.490
I don't want anyone after
me, especially Boyd.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.766
You can go now.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.281
Not till I know you ain't gonna wake
up tomorrow mornin' and run again.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.885
You don't give a shit about me.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.644
You just care
that I don't jeopardize

00:32.759 --> 00:34.888
your precious case against Boyd.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.246
Raylan Givens.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.402
I thought that was
your car out front.

00:38.480 --> 00:41.051
Baby, how long has
our guest been here

00:41.120 --> 00:43.885
without you
offering him a drink?

00:43.960 --> 00:46.042
This here is what
the man would call

00:46.120 --> 00:47.645
an "unknown unknown."

00:47.760 --> 00:49.762
<i>Something you don't
even know you don't know.</i>

00:49.880 --> 00:52.884
Ava tell you anything about
what she got up to yesterday?

00:53.360 --> 00:54.691
You know what has to be done.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.046
Choo-Choo's a rock.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.241
He'd never give us up.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.560
Not on purpose.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.926
I won't let you kill her.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Fine, then. You kill her,
like you were ordered to.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.447
<i>Put your hands on your head
and get on the ground.</i>

01:11.880 --> 01:14.167
Roadblocks set up
already here and here,

01:14.240 --> 01:15.526
but if he's ex-special ops,

01:15.600 --> 01:17.364
he's more than likely
to go up and around.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.566
We got helicopters up?

01:18.680 --> 01:20.444
We got helicopter...
Singular... Up.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.885
Well, can we get more?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.610
I don't know. I ain't the
one who flies helicopters.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.920
I don't want this guy
going all Eric Frein on us,

01:25.960 --> 01:27.644
hole up at some derelict
airport for weeks

01:27.720 --> 01:29.484
while we're out here
chasing our own dicks.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.891
Sounds really strange
when you say that.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.086
I'm running shit.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.844
I get to use the expression.
Roger that.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.729
Nelson, how many
can state police spare?

01:35.920 --> 01:36.921
How many what, now?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.729
Maybe get Art
to call in a favor.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.931
Chief, I got to go.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.281
I got a thing.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.407
You got a thing.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.284
You ain't gonna take my
word for it, are you?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.522
You see what we got here.
We're looking for a shooter.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.284
Yes, I was involved
in that shooting.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.805
Now you got the
Marshals en route.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.450
Plus, you asked me
to take 24 hours

01:54.520 --> 01:56.124
to decompress
and regroup, right?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.885
You want out.
You want out of the manhunt.

01:59.480 --> 02:00.641
I keep reliving it.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.290
It's like a movie I keep seeing.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.441
Raylan.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.520
Probably gonna have to take
meds to help me sleep.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.086
Fine. If you want to
decompress, go decompress.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.566
Just be somewhere
I can find you.

02:09.639 --> 02:10.640
You know I will be.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.449
And don't decompress
all over Walker

02:12.520 --> 02:15.444
if this is about you happening across
the man somewhere on your own.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.124
I got it. I'm gone.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.401
Good luck.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.481
It's Walker.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.483
He wants to talk to both of us.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.326
I was beginning
to feel concerned for you.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.365
How are things?

02:39.440 --> 02:40.680
I'm afraid...

02:40.760 --> 02:42.808
We got a bit of a problem, Mr.
Markham.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.801
I'm gonna need an extraction
if it's still available.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.170
<i>You sit tight.</i>

02:51.600 --> 02:53.682
I'm gonna get you to a doctor.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.762
Now, where are you, son?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.360
Sergeant?

02:58.480 --> 02:59.686
I'm coming for you, Top.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.569
Is your car's GPS still active?

03:09.280 --> 03:10.805
I knew I could count
on you, Sergeant.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.647
<i>I am near Corbin.</i>

03:13.720 --> 03:17.088
I'm holed up in an abandoned
church on the East side of town.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.370
You can't miss it.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.125
Okay, Top, you hang on.
I'm coming.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.891
Where you going, Sean?

03:24.960 --> 03:26.291
We can't just
leave him out there.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.481
He's hurt and he's a target.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.365
You and I both know he ain't
gonna be where he said he was.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.564
You go out there
and get rolled up

03:33.640 --> 03:35.563
in their horseshit dragnet,

03:36.640 --> 03:38.005
then where are we?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.490
So, now...

03:41.760 --> 03:46.482
Before you rush off into
whatever hazards await...

03:47.240 --> 03:48.810
It's not about the money.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.051
You're correct.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.485
It's about loyalty.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.611
And I need yours.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.049
More than that,
it's about freedom.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.001
Freedom from what?

04:04.080 --> 04:05.491
You stay loyal to me,

04:06.080 --> 04:07.764
and I'll fix it so the only one

04:07.840 --> 04:10.127
you ever have to
take orders from again...

04:11.320 --> 04:12.685
Is you.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.651
That's freedom.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.249
Give you my word on it.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.525
Walker is burned.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.729
He's a rogue element.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.325
Ain't nothing for him now.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.601
Got to stay out
of that fire he started.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.971
What about me?

04:34.040 --> 04:36.725
That whore can identify
you from Schreier's.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.648
So if I was you,
I'd lay low for a while.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.448
Can I count on you, son?

04:59.520 --> 05:01.045
Good man.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.890
Mmm.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.321
Mmm-hmm.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.004
You need another pair of hands?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.006
Boyd.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.881
Is Earl still here?

05:16.040 --> 05:19.089
No. I let Earl go
home for the evening.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.844
No, baby.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.400
It's just you and me
and the dishes.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.720
Mmm!

05:25.920 --> 05:26.921
Mmm.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.010
And my overnight bag.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.491
Well, I took the liberty

05:31.600 --> 05:33.125
of packing some clothes for you.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.531
I hope you don't mind.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.322
We going back to Lexington?

05:38.920 --> 05:40.490
No, baby, we gonna go up

05:40.560 --> 05:42.881
to my daddy's hunting
cabin in Bulletville.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.289
And why we going to Bulletville?

05:45.360 --> 05:46.486
Well, I figured,

05:46.560 --> 05:49.769
with everything that's been
going on in our lives lately,

05:50.240 --> 05:51.526
we needed a break.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.044
When I dug coal,

05:54.120 --> 05:56.691
I'd go up to that cabin
at least once a week,

05:56.760 --> 05:58.489
breathe in
that fresh mountain air,

05:58.600 --> 06:02.082
clear all of that mine
dust out of my lungs.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.050
Just you and me?

06:05.280 --> 06:06.486
Just the two of us.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.406
Mmm.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.567
Baby, that cabin is so far away.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.802
Maybe we can just,
uh, stay here tonight.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.720
I just want to finish cleaning,

06:22.800 --> 06:25.121
curl up on the couch,
and watch some TV.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.482
I wasn't asking.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.010
I want to see you first
thing in the morning

06:30.080 --> 06:31.923
by that green mountain light.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.084
Meet you in the truck in five.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.843
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.160
I'm so sorry.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.084
So you said... On the
phone, about 30 times.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.804
I just...
It was in the calendar.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.245
I just, uh...
I'm fine, Raylan.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.448
I took an Uber, and, uh,
we only got lost once.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.931
I'm pretty sure
that was my fault.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.445
Did you eat? Do you want to eat?
There's a...

07:05.520 --> 07:07.727
We're good. I hope you didn't
come racing over here.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.280
I might have. Propelled by
guilt, having dropped the ball.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.600
All the way from Harlan?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.443
Well, she threw up on the plane,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.204
and she hasn't stopped bitching
about the trip ever since.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.170
But seeing as though you haven't
had a chance to do so yet,

07:19.720 --> 07:21.961
would you like to hold
your daughter, Raylan?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.005
There you go.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.884
Hello, little girl.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.281
Aww.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.371
I know you probably
have to go, but...

07:32.720 --> 07:33.926
I'm not going anywhere.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.406
Hey.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.724
Hey, Pig.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.968
Could he still be alive?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.568
You want to climb
down there and find out?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.245
Maybe I will.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.201
God!

08:31.480 --> 08:33.289
Ground ain't stable.
That's how he slipped.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.600
Ugh!
Don't be careful,

08:34.679 --> 08:36.648
you'll end up down
there with him.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.611
I heard him hit.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.563
Time it took, I'd say
it's about a 300-foot drop.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.330
Only way your boy's still alive
is if he's made of iron.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.606
I got to call Boyd.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.286
Tell him what happened.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.283
Nah, you don't tell him something
like this on the phone.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.930
Yeah, well, you don't
give me orders, either.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.122
Whenever we lost one of our own,

08:59.320 --> 09:01.561
every man who worked with him

09:01.960 --> 09:04.042
went to the house of the family

09:04.480 --> 09:08.644
to deliver the news,
to comfort in person.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.765
Yeah. Well, The Pig
wasn't one of Boyd's own.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.689
Don't matter, now, does it?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.645
That boy gave his life

09:18.400 --> 09:19.731
doing this job.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.882
You show him some
goddamn respect.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.605
Whatever, old man.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.003
I'm gonna tell him
how I'm gonna tell him.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.891
You all right with that?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.166
Fine.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.561
All good?

09:43.640 --> 09:44.766
Status quo.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.610
What is it you're missing out on

09:47.680 --> 09:48.920
while you're here
playing the family man?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.729
Oh, nothing big.
A little chase.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.080
How long are you two here?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.844
Well, we have an appointment
with Frieder tomorrow,

09:54.040 --> 09:55.520
and then we're gonna
do some visiting.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.891
And then we're out the next day.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.281
Frieder's the, uh, O.B.?

09:59.640 --> 10:01.768
Uh, pediatrician.
Ah.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.283
Can you hold that for me?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.440
Yeah, that's fine.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.726
This is one of those situations

10:10.800 --> 10:12.768
where I'm gonna need you to...

10:13.360 --> 10:15.522
Not freak out, maybe sit down.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.563
I'm not freaking out.
And I don't want to sit down.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.449
Okay.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.126
Um, Willa's well-baby check
a few weeks back,

10:22.200 --> 10:24.646
the doctor that
my mother recommended,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.131
he was listening to her heart

10:26.200 --> 10:27.850
and says maybe
he hears something.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.407
That sounds bad.
Is that bad?

10:31.040 --> 10:33.964
He's, uh, he's rating it
a grade 4 heart murmur,

10:34.040 --> 10:35.804
which means it's...
It's pretty loud,

10:35.880 --> 10:37.325
but it's not super-loud.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.290
It could be a congenital defect,

10:40.360 --> 10:41.640
or she could just
grow out of it.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.166
And, you know, it's not like I
don't trust this guy, but...

10:44.360 --> 10:46.203
You trust Frieder.
Yeah.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.691
And she said she could get Willa

10:47.760 --> 10:49.330
in to see
the peds-cardiologist

10:49.400 --> 10:51.528
and they can run some tests
and see what's what.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.721
Jesus.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.640
Are you freaking out?

10:57.080 --> 10:58.809
I am not freaking out.
Are you freaking out?

10:58.880 --> 11:00.370
I am not freaking out.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.803
But I am gonna have to put myself
down with a stiff drink, so...

11:03.920 --> 11:05.410
By the way, how is your mother?

11:07.080 --> 11:08.650
That's so weird.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.923
Um, she's fine.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.490
She would love to know
that you were interested.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.925
Well, she might
at least appreciate

11:14.000 --> 11:16.082
that I pretended
to be interested.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.845
She's driving me into the ground

11:17.920 --> 11:19.331
with these
mommy-and-me classes.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.091
"You got to get that
baby out to see the world.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.484
"Work on your
networking skills."

11:24.920 --> 11:26.445
"Socializing the child"
is what she calls it.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.289
She's been watching <i>The View.</i>
Mmm.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.606
I tell her, "You know what?

11:29.680 --> 11:31.011
"Why don't you try balancing
a baby on your ass

11:31.080 --> 11:32.241
"while you're doing yoga?"

11:32.320 --> 11:35.324
Didn't she put you in daycare when
you were like only a month old?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.084
Seems it's easier
to give motherly advice

11:37.160 --> 11:38.844
than it is to actually mother.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.524
Oh, you want her?
Uh-huh.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.930
She did try and, uh, set
me up on a date, though,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.331
if you can imagine that.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.930
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.682
A guy named Randy, divorced.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.731
I thought he was a cousin,
but apparently not.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.211
So, what'd you say?

11:58.320 --> 11:59.731
Oh, well, I haven't
said anything yet.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.484
Why?
What should I say?

12:02.800 --> 12:04.325
You say whatever you want.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.965
Well, I would say
he looks a little too much

12:06.040 --> 12:08.122
like Wallace Shawn for my taste.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.647
Oh!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.526
Uh, another thing...

12:13.680 --> 12:15.170
Hmm?
...uh, while I'm here.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.561
The lawyers came back
with the custody agreement,

12:17.640 --> 12:20.928
and they're gonna need us to
formalize our joint-custody pattern.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.447
Which brings up the question,

12:23.520 --> 12:25.284
are we gonna
share custody of Willa?

12:25.360 --> 12:26.920
Because if we are,
we need to figure out

12:26.960 --> 12:28.166
how we're gonna break that up.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.525
Can we get a fire going?

12:35.920 --> 12:37.046
In a minute.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.846
But first...

12:41.960 --> 12:44.691
I think I got something to
make you forget that cold...

12:45.200 --> 12:47.123
If it's still here.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.445
Ah.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.165
Oh!

12:56.360 --> 12:58.044
Aha!

12:58.640 --> 13:01.291
Well, here it is.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.601
What's that?

13:02.680 --> 13:07.641
This is one of the
last surviving bottles

13:07.720 --> 13:10.326
of the Pappy Van Winkle
warehouse fire of '95.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.967
Only three cases left untouched.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.845
My daddy pilfered
one of those cases,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.968
and I, in turn,
may have pilfered

13:18.040 --> 13:20.884
one bottle from that one case.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.286
May have?

13:22.360 --> 13:23.600
Well, I admit nothing.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.768
I don't know that there is
a statute of limitations

13:26.840 --> 13:28.524
on that kind
of deviant behavior.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.250
I'll keep my mouth
shut either way.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.890
Well, I certainly hope you can.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.044
You know...

13:35.120 --> 13:37.361
I have kept this bottle up here

13:38.280 --> 13:39.964
for all these years

13:40.040 --> 13:44.762
only to be opened on the
night that I got married.

13:46.520 --> 13:51.162
But seeing as how we
are on the precipice

13:51.240 --> 13:52.605
of starting our lives together,

13:52.680 --> 13:55.081
I though, no better
time than the present.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.370
I'm not superstitious,

13:57.480 --> 13:59.528
but I think we should
wait till we're married.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.529
Why jinx the future?

14:01.600 --> 14:02.726
I've been waiting on this moment

14:02.800 --> 14:04.484
damn near 20 years, Ava.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.487
You will have a shot with me.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.285
I'll have one.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.570
That's all I ask.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.600
Mmm.

14:21.800 --> 14:25.168
Goddamn! That's
like drinking silk.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.051
Let me see that.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.802
My, oh, my.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.962
That is beautiful.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.442
My fiancé did good.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.883
You know, my mama and daddy

14:48.960 --> 14:50.803
were married on this very spot.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.120
Said their vows right in
front of that fireplace.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.289
Got me to thinking...

14:56.400 --> 14:58.721
Maybe me and you ought
to write our own vows.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.083
You serious?
I am.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.882
Not some rote commitment
recited without meaning...

15:05.480 --> 15:07.130
Something from the heart.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.969
And no "till death do us part,"

15:09.040 --> 15:10.769
'cause I don't want to hear
about that on my wedding day.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.002
Oh, me neither.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.126
But I do think we ought to
talk about commitment...

15:17.400 --> 15:18.686
Trust...

15:19.520 --> 15:20.726
Loyalty.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.603
Those are important words.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.605
Wouldn't you agree?

15:26.680 --> 15:27.920
Why wouldn't I?

15:29.240 --> 15:33.643
You know, when my mama
and daddy got married,

15:34.280 --> 15:36.851
"I promise to obey"
was in their wedding vows.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.321
Did you hear that from
inside your mama's womb?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.960
My daddy'd bring it up
every time he hit my mama.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.407
Although I don't think

15:44.480 --> 15:46.323
he ever did get
around to obeying her.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.049
Bowman never troubled
himself making excuses.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.525
Me, myself...

15:57.680 --> 16:00.001
...I don't believe that a man
should ever hit a woman.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.727
Or, at least, I ain't
found a reason yet.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.450
Meaning you could find one?

16:06.120 --> 16:09.329
Well, what if a handsome
man smiled at me

16:09.720 --> 16:11.484
and somehow that was my fault?

16:12.320 --> 16:14.448
Or I didn't have
your dinner ready

16:14.520 --> 16:16.602
exactly when you came home?

16:17.880 --> 16:19.325
Would you beat on me,

16:19.400 --> 16:22.404
then apologize and promise
to never do it again?

16:22.480 --> 16:26.644
And keep that promise
maybe one day, maybe two.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.563
Ava, have I ever done
anything to you?

16:30.200 --> 16:33.522
Have I ever hurt you in any way?

16:35.760 --> 16:38.411
Bowman was sweet as candy
till we got married.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.408
Then I was his property.
Well...

16:42.720 --> 16:44.245
I ain't my brother.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.721
No, but you are a
Crowder, aren't you?

16:47.480 --> 16:49.244
You forced me to come up here.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.880
You make me drink
when I don't want to.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.284
You gonna take his bottle,
crack it over my head next?

16:57.440 --> 16:58.680
Like Bowman would do?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.609
That what you want?

17:02.360 --> 17:03.566
I don't know what I want.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.325
You want to hit me a little bit, don't you?
Tha'd feel good?

17:06.440 --> 17:09.090
It might. Well, then, go on, girl.
Do it.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.644
Do what?
Hit me, woman.

17:13.440 --> 17:14.601
Go on.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.486
Boyd!

17:26.960 --> 17:28.200
Boyd!

18:10.800 --> 18:12.006
Aah!

18:12.200 --> 18:13.486
Aah!

19:23.400 --> 19:24.640
I hear you in there.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.006
About time.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.605
Let me guess.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.924
Fraternity brothers?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.280
What educational institution

19:40.360 --> 19:42.727
is lucky enough to
have you for students?

19:43.360 --> 19:46.250
F.U. heard of it?

19:47.120 --> 19:49.327
Great proctology program.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.000
I'll bet you'd love it.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.367
Oh, went up my nose.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.249
I never went to college myself.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.489
Joined the army
right out of high school.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.007
Gave me some notion
of fraternity.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.562
And we thank you
for your service.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.250
Now, if you're done whipping
your army pud in there,

20:08.760 --> 20:10.000
I got to shit.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.285
Begging the question,

20:14.280 --> 20:16.248
will your brother
over there step in

20:17.440 --> 20:18.965
when I split your skull open?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.282
I... Whoa, whoa, look.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.640
I... I was...
Just kidding, man.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.087
So was I.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.527
Ahh. Apologies.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.324
My twisted sense of humor.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.324
It has been a day.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.290
Where you boys headed?

20:46.800 --> 20:49.371
Uh, Disney World.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.561
Disney world.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.324
Maybe The Wizarding World
of Harry Potter.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.890
Orlando, huh?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.522
Of all the gin joints in...

20:57.200 --> 20:59.771
The fates are smiling
upon me, gentlemen.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.444
I was headed there myself!

21:01.560 --> 21:03.528
Gonna deliver this
to an old army buddy.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.527
Memento of our time in the box.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.402
This vest saved
his life many a time.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.166
Hey.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.689
How about I give you $300

21:18.560 --> 21:21.245
to deliver it
to Orlando for me, huh?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.884
Go ahead. Take it.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.366
Take it.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.087
And for your incidentals...

21:33.040 --> 21:34.121
Now, don't be shy.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.726
You buy all the PBR and
Funyuns you can stomach.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.726
Now, the address
is 1212 main street.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.040
Repeat that back to me.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.485
1212 main street.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.484
See how easy
that is to remember?

21:45.560 --> 21:47.722
Much appreciated, gentlemen.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.644
You two have fun.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.688
You know, how could you not?

21:51.760 --> 21:53.762
That's the happiest
place on earth!

21:54.000 --> 21:56.287
Is there something else I could
be doing or I should be doing?

21:56.360 --> 21:58.124
You do realize
that that question

21:58.200 --> 21:59.929
puts it on me to come
up with a task to

22:00.000 --> 22:01.604
occupy you with on top of
having to deal with her?

22:01.720 --> 22:03.404
Okay. That's fair.
Sorry.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.891
No. That's all right.
I'm sorry. I know.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.485
It's just, it's been
six hours of this,

22:06.560 --> 22:08.085
and I... I don't know
what to do anymore.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.491
Is it the heart murmur thing?

22:09.560 --> 22:12.450
No, it's, um, it's an ear
infection and a chest cold,

22:12.560 --> 22:14.164
and this is my life.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.561
This is what it looks like now.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.926
Aww.

22:18.280 --> 22:20.601
Well, that question you
were asking before about,

22:20.680 --> 22:23.524
do I want to be involved
in my daughter's life?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.011
Yeah?
Of course I do.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.686
Okay, well, this is your
daughter's life, Raylan.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.886
This is what it looks like.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.769
But you can see that I'm here

22:30.840 --> 22:32.410
and that I'm racking my brain

22:32.480 --> 22:33.880
trying to figure out
how I can help.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.365
I don't know.
I don't know.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.771
I never know with you.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.360
'Cause you got that
thing, you got that

22:38.400 --> 22:39.765
"I couldn't care less" thing.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.609
I... How am I supposed to know?
Know what?

22:41.680 --> 22:43.444
What you want, Raylan.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.090
And look, I'm not gonna lie.
I liked it.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.525
It's part of what
drew me to you.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.250
But this is different.
Things are different now.

22:50.320 --> 22:53.529
And trying to factor in where
your head's at with us right now,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.005
it's exhausting!

22:55.080 --> 22:57.003
And it's unfair. And
frankly, it's bullshit.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.206
Okay.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.169
And you still haven't answered the
question about custody about.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.480
Oh!

23:01.560 --> 23:03.050
How involved you want
to be in our lives.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.724
I know. I know.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.121
Because you know
how involved I want to be.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.361
I mean, don't you?

23:08.440 --> 23:09.771
I don't know anything right now.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.605
All I do know is that
it's 3:00 in the morning,

23:12.680 --> 23:14.250
I have been on
two flights and an Uber

23:14.320 --> 23:16.084
with this demon child
attached to my boob,

23:16.160 --> 23:17.730
and I can't get it up right now

23:17.800 --> 23:19.290
to answer your
questions for you.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.930
So why don't you give us ladies

23:21.000 --> 23:22.764
the bathroom
for a little while, okay?

23:41.840 --> 23:42.841
Mmm.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.089
What the hell, Boyd?

23:46.160 --> 23:47.844
We going hunting.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.441
What?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.648
First day of razorback
season, state of Kentucky.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.490
I already got the coffee going.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.964
What time is it?

23:57.120 --> 23:58.485
It's early.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.887
And we need to get to the
stand while the sun is rising

24:02.040 --> 24:03.371
if we gonna bag us a shoat.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.920
Get up.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.042
I know, I know, I know, I know.
I know. I know.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.164
I'm sorry I howled at you.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.044
You weren't the only one
howling, as I recollect.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.804
Oh, Raylan.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.326
What is it with this baby?
What is it gonna take?

24:33.600 --> 24:35.204
Winona,
for the love of the child,

24:35.280 --> 24:36.964
let me take her out for
ice cream or something.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.202
I'm not gonna give her ice cream.
Maybe a taste.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.486
But I'm gonna have
some ice cream,

24:40.560 --> 24:42.369
and I'll drive her around a bit.
That helps, right?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.010
And then you can get some sleep.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.927
What is... What is this
sleep you speak of?

24:50.200 --> 24:51.645
Hi. Hello.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.205
That's it.
I've got you.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.044
I've got you.
Yeah.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.329
Don't tell me you're the closer.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.211
No. I wish I was.
That'd be cool.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.211
No, I'm just a P.O.D.
Plain old deputy.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.800
But I was just walking past,
and I thought

25:13.880 --> 25:15.723
you looked really familiar.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.291
You mind if I ask your name?

25:17.360 --> 25:18.566
Avery Markham.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.881
Markham! That's right...
Avery Markham.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.124
You know what?

25:23.200 --> 25:24.850
When I was just a pup,

25:24.960 --> 25:27.645
I served some warrants
on some of your men.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.011
And then you and I passed each
other one day in the courtroom

25:32.120 --> 25:35.169
when that judge you paid off
dismissed all the charges.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.729
You must not have
made an impression.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.486
I don't remember you.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.803
Well, memory loss...
That's a sure sign of old age.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.085
So's losing your hearing.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.127
How about the old fishing pole?

25:50.240 --> 25:52.163
Still able to hook
a fish with it?

25:52.240 --> 25:54.288
You know, I've been
married for 28 years.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.806
I don't get the pole out
as much as I used to.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.245
But I hear you do.

25:59.320 --> 26:02.210
I heard you pulled Katherine
Hale into your boat.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.806
Why would you care

26:03.880 --> 26:05.769
about my relationship
with Katherine Hale?

26:05.840 --> 26:07.046
Well, I don't.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.442
Except for the one that you
had with her 14 years ago.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.927
Wasn't it around that
time that her husband,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.207
Grady Hale,
got killed in prison?

26:15.920 --> 26:17.160
I... Sorry.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.844
I have trouble
remembering things, too.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.130
I heard it was suicide.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.690
Suicide, huh?

26:23.880 --> 26:24.961
Wow.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.204
Well, I mean,
the reason I recall it

26:28.280 --> 26:30.442
is because that's
around the same time

26:30.520 --> 26:33.364
that U.S. Attorney Simon Poole
got his head blown off.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.326
You remember that?

26:35.400 --> 26:37.767
I remember he had a
hard-on for Grady.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.763
He did. That's right.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.603
And... And you were
Grady's partner, right?

26:44.640 --> 26:46.210
You know, a lot of
people were saying

26:46.360 --> 26:50.922
that Simon Poole claimed he
had a snitch in Grady's camp

26:51.000 --> 26:52.729
that ratted him out.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.527
You wouldn't have any idea
who that was, would you?

26:56.400 --> 26:57.890
I'm confused.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.644
Are you calling me a murderer
or are you calling me a rat?

27:01.840 --> 27:05.970
Well, neither, as such.
I'm just... thinking.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.202
I mean, it...
It wouldn't make sense

27:08.280 --> 27:11.807
for you to kill Poole to
slow down Grady's case

27:11.880 --> 27:13.882
just to turn around
and kill Grady

27:13.960 --> 27:15.962
so that you could be
with Katherine if...

27:16.040 --> 27:18.008
If I was just gonna
leave Kentucky?

27:18.080 --> 27:19.366
Exactly.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.249
That was not an easy decision.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.644
I loved Katherine.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.640
Still do.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.363
Well, that's very sweet.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.411
But why leave? Unless.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.011
Maybe you didn't trust her.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.801
Or you didn't know what
she was gonna do to you.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.164
Well, you picked
a hell of a time

27:46.240 --> 27:47.844
for "take your
daughter to work" day.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.684
I figured it'd be easier
selling her here

27:49.760 --> 27:51.524
than someplace
I didn't know anybody.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.325
Oh, my goodness.
What a relief.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.363
She doesn't look like you.
Good for her.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.646
What are you doing here?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.330
I'm just bored.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.050
I love a good manhunt.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.963
Hey, they rolled Markham up.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.849
Doesn't look like we're
keeping him much longer.

28:03.920 --> 28:04.967
No, we're not.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.200
So if you want to talk to him,
you better get in there.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.321
Isn't that right?

28:08.400 --> 28:10.368
Daddy better go talk
to the bad man.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.681
Some other time, huh?

28:12.760 --> 28:13.841
Well, she's beautiful.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.406
I wouldn't leave her
in this office much longer.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.608
Too many reprobates in here.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.088
And I'm talking about
the ones on the payroll.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.400
Take it easy, Art.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.130
This is where daddy sits.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.406
Yours, I hope.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.005
That's what they tell me.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.404
See that? Huh?

28:32.120 --> 28:33.485
Why aren't you on the manhunt?

28:33.640 --> 28:36.564
Oh, I myself was given
24 hours to decompress.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.649
Look what you started,
Norma Rae.

28:38.720 --> 28:39.721
So what are you doing here?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.768
Tracking this asshole's
credit cards.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.325
Walker's using credit cards?

28:43.440 --> 28:45.727
Crossed the Harlan County
line into Wabash County

28:45.800 --> 28:48.963
and immediately spent
$120 at Leo's liquor.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.288
Second card for gas in Tennessee

28:51.360 --> 28:52.964
before going back
to the first card

28:53.040 --> 28:56.123
and spending over $300 at a
porno shop in Murfreesboro.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.725
That ain't him.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.961
You mean Walker's not
an alcoholic porn addict

29:01.040 --> 29:02.201
with a full tank of gas

29:02.280 --> 29:05.011
who compartmentalizes his vice
spending from his staples?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.730
Well, I don't know
what you just said,

29:06.800 --> 29:09.007
but he must have given
someone his credit cards.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.605
He ain't stupid enough
to use them,

29:10.680 --> 29:12.205
and he wouldn't buy
all that shit.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.521
I know. That's why I was
condescending to you just now.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.525
Go ahead and get
your shots in now.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.965
She won't be
with me all the time.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.804
Do you hear how I'm
condescending to you just now?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.609
Raylan. Why are you here?

29:21.680 --> 29:22.727
You want to hold her?

29:22.800 --> 29:24.325
Did you ask Tim
if he wanted to hold her?

29:24.400 --> 29:27.609
No, because he is not a
nurturing, caring human being.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.250
He's kind of an asshole.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.924
No. Can I... Can I hold her?

29:32.160 --> 29:34.049
So, Why'd you leave Harlan?

29:34.160 --> 29:36.766
Boss doesn't get to play
around in the woods all day.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.120
So everything's under control.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.964
Even if it wasn't,
what good are you to me

29:41.040 --> 29:42.530
with a baby on your hip?

29:42.720 --> 29:44.210
You sure you don't
want to hold her?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.411
Shouldn't you be, you know,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.090
taking care of her or something?

29:48.200 --> 29:50.123
I thought that's what I was
doing, bringing her here.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.607
Brooks.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.366
Raylan.
Hmm?

30:22.560 --> 30:24.244
Come on!

31:10.280 --> 31:11.964
Oh, for...

31:27.520 --> 31:29.807
911.
<i>What is your emergency?</i>

31:29.880 --> 31:31.928
All those times hunting, Ava.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.162
What was the first
animal you ever killed?

31:34.920 --> 31:36.081
Squirrel.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.446
Squirrel?

31:38.000 --> 31:39.161
How old were you?

31:39.880 --> 31:41.006
Six.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.321
Daddy gave me
a .410 for my birthday.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.609
You kill that squirrel
with one shot?

31:46.920 --> 31:48.365
No, I didn't.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.200
Could barely hold the gun,
I was shaking so hard.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.322
You sound like Cousin Johnny,

31:53.400 --> 31:55.050
worst rifle shot lever did see.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.925
He'd only go hunting with a
four-wheeler and a spotlight.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.204
That ain't sport.
It's slaughter.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.842
You got to give
an animal a fair shake.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.842
Well, makes sense.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.724
Johnny was a coward.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.281
I never understood where
I went wrong with him.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.367
Why he saw fit to betray me.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.331
Devil, too.

32:16.520 --> 32:20.411
If they weren't happy
with their lot in my crew.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.723
Why didn't they just come to me?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.123
I'm a reasonable man.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.690
We could have hashed
our differences out

32:27.760 --> 32:29.046
over a bottle of Woodford.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.802
Why you think they
wouldn't do that, Ava?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.565
Maybe because they were afraid

32:34.680 --> 32:36.682
of what you were
gonna do to them.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.484
What you did to them.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.044
You scared of me?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.365
Sometimes.

32:53.880 --> 32:54.881
Don't move.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.121
You just stay right there.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.121
Boyd?

33:03.680 --> 33:04.761
Stay right there.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.845
Boyd!

33:24.040 --> 33:25.690
Boyd.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.891
Aah!

33:33.160 --> 33:34.286
Daah!

33:37.920 --> 33:39.206
Boyd?

33:39.280 --> 33:40.611
Boyd?

33:42.640 --> 33:44.608
First hog of the season!

33:45.440 --> 33:48.046
Now, you stay right there!
I'm gonna go get the truck!

33:48.120 --> 33:50.771
We gonna have us some
pork tonight, baby!

33:51.520 --> 33:52.931
Whoo!

34:09.040 --> 34:11.281
Oh, my God. Y'all
were gone forever.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.210
Sorry.
Don't be sorry.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.447
It's the best sleep
I've had in weeks.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.402
And is that silence I hear?

34:18.480 --> 34:20.641
Seems she's feeling
somewhat improved.

34:20.719 --> 34:21.926
Oh, baby girl.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.650
I never love you more than I
love you when you're quiet.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.882
It's been like that
for at least an hour or so.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.570
So, where did y'all go?

34:28.639 --> 34:29.971
Well, drove around,

34:30.040 --> 34:32.007
went to the park
for a little bit.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.850
Is that why the office called and
said you left her pacifier there?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.360
Did they wake you?

34:37.480 --> 34:38.527
They did.

34:38.600 --> 34:39.761
I just...
Okay, Raylan.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.284
You don't have to
tell me stories.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.251
I mean, obviously,
I trust you with her.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.527
You know that, right?
Yes, I know that.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.601
I don't know
why I left that part out.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.928
I guess I thought
you'd just think...

34:51.679 --> 34:53.400
Oh, I don't know.
I just couldn't stay away.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.524
Oh, I know you can't stay away.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.965
It's not like that's a theory.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.411
You know,
what I don't understand

34:59.480 --> 35:02.324
is that you haven't figured
out that I know that already.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.731
And yet, here I am.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.925
What does that tell you?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.889
Thank you so much
for watching her.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.247
You don't know the half
of how bad I needed that.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.203
I got to come clean
to you about something.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.923
Um, Willa's heart
wasn't the only thing

35:35.000 --> 35:36.604
that got me on
the plane out here.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.569
I mean, it was...
It was part of it, but...

35:41.240 --> 35:42.605
Just...

35:42.680 --> 35:45.411
All that worrying about it,
it really got me thinking.

35:47.880 --> 35:49.564
And, uh...

35:52.520 --> 35:54.363
Um...
What is it?

35:54.440 --> 35:55.851
Hey.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.362
I used to lie awake in our bed

35:58.560 --> 36:00.050
when you'd be out doing

36:00.120 --> 36:02.407
whatever it was
that you did, and...

36:03.520 --> 36:05.045
And I would get so worked up

36:05.120 --> 36:07.407
over thinking about

36:08.080 --> 36:10.082
if you were never
gonna come home again

36:11.040 --> 36:13.168
and what I would do
if that happened.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.321
And that seemed to me...
Unbearable.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.728
And...
And it seemed unfair.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.240
I suppose it was.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.244
Well, whether it was
or it wasn't or is,

36:25.240 --> 36:29.689
now I lie awake
next to this little girl...

36:30.200 --> 36:31.361
And...

36:33.320 --> 36:35.288
I listen to her breathe.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.927
I know you're not coming home.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.245
And it's...

36:44.800 --> 36:46.450
That certainty...

36:49.920 --> 36:51.684
I'm just saying, I think...

36:51.800 --> 36:53.802
I think I liked it better
the first way.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.890
Winona, are you saying...

36:59.960 --> 37:01.769
What I'm saying is...

37:02.280 --> 37:06.763
God damn it. I'm saying I
love you and I miss you

37:06.840 --> 37:08.968
and I want you to come home, and
I don't care where home is.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.811
I don't care if it's
here or in Miami

37:12.000 --> 37:14.048
or in the hills.
It doesn't matter to me.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.325
But if you want it,

37:18.480 --> 37:20.403
I want you by my side
raising our daughter.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.925
So, I guess
what I'm saying is...

37:26.240 --> 37:27.844
You can be with me...

37:29.040 --> 37:30.690
And still be you.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.683
If that's something you want.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.521
Well, you should get it.

37:39.640 --> 37:40.766
You're gonna wake her up.
It's Rachel.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.001
I'll send her to voicemail.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.003
Did you not hear a word I just said?
Answer it.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.405
Hey.
Ava's up at Bulletville.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.527
Say what?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.726
<i>We tracked her phone.</i>

37:49.800 --> 37:51.450
Boyd has a cabin there, right?

37:51.520 --> 37:53.124
Any reason she'd go to it?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.440
Not that I can think of.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.726
Haven't you heard from her?

37:55.840 --> 37:57.251
Not a word.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.566
I'm gonna need a little time.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.967
<i>Raylan</i> - If she's in Bulletville,
she's in Bulletville.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.771
Magic 8 Ball says
"Ask again later."

38:04.840 --> 38:07.241
I will reach out and I
will stay by my phone.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.686
All right?

38:09.200 --> 38:10.531
Get here when you can.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.251
Thank god.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.881
Hey!

38:51.120 --> 38:53.009
My brother's hurt real bad.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.646
We were hiking. He fell.
He split his head open.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.370
There's... There's a lot of blood.
Please.

38:57.480 --> 38:59.687
Okay, sir.
Just give us a second.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.728
Let's see what's going on
with you here, buddy. Okay?

39:01.800 --> 39:04.610
Oh, n... I... I'm fine.
I got poked by a branch.

39:04.680 --> 39:06.045
It's... It's nothing.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.281
Please, forget about me.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.521
Just go...
Go get my brother.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.886
I'll go ahead and call it in.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.604
Get a bird in the air.
Tell them we got a climber.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.960
Oh, no. We don't need a chopper.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.684
He's right on top of the ridge.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.251
Sir, standard procedure.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.880
We don't need them,
we don't need them.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.051
What's that?

39:24.120 --> 39:25.565
Oh, it's just antibiotic.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.811
Now hold still.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.360
I thought methohexital
was a sedative.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.961
Huh!

39:40.040 --> 39:41.451
No, no, no.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.201
"Be on the lookout,
bearded Sasquatch man,

39:46.320 --> 39:48.049
"Possible gunshot wound."

39:48.120 --> 39:49.167
Is that right?

39:50.560 --> 39:52.164
That sound right?
Yes, yes! Jesus!

39:52.240 --> 39:54.521
Didn't realize they were gonna
send me a couple of heroes.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.850
All I wanted was that kit...

39:58.480 --> 39:59.720
Patch myself up.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.723
See a man I got to see,
do a job I got to do.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.325
That's all.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.882
Then they send me
a pair of heroes.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.244
He was a hero.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.964
Put me in the back,
strap me down.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.849
I-I won't be able to move
or call anyone.

40:11.920 --> 40:14.280
And you can take the kit. You
can take the kit and get away.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.045
Yeah, I could do that.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.845
But it's been such a day.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.441
That flank looks like
it's been to hell and back.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.330
I ain't hungry.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.080
Well...

40:44.640 --> 40:47.530
I am famished.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.520
And whatever the good lord
sees fit to provide...

40:54.280 --> 40:56.248
You believe in God, Ava?

40:57.200 --> 40:58.929
Why'd you bring me
up here, Boyd?

40:59.880 --> 41:04.204
Just to spend a lovely
24 hours with my lady.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.965
Bullshit.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.884
You've been dancing around
something since we got here.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.485
So, why don't you just come out

41:10.560 --> 41:11.971
and say whatever
it is you got to say?

41:13.640 --> 41:15.449
You want to get that?

41:19.920 --> 41:23.845
Is that
your salon calling again?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.368
You been lying to me, Ava.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.565
I know you ran.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.641
I know you went
to see Limehouse.

41:33.280 --> 41:38.525
I know someone
helped you escape Errol.

41:38.640 --> 41:41.007
And it wasn't
just that constable.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.003
And not 24 hours later,

41:44.320 --> 41:45.685
I come home

41:46.480 --> 41:48.562
to find Raylan Givens

41:48.640 --> 41:51.450
sitting in your goddamn kitchen.

41:52.280 --> 41:54.362
So, how about you come out,

41:54.440 --> 41:56.681
say what it is you got to say?

42:00.800 --> 42:02.086
I'm a snitch.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.321
A what?

42:03.400 --> 42:05.243
I'm a C.I. For Raylan.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.689
I sold you out, Boyd.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.364
You gonna kill me?

42:44.880 --> 42:46.325
That it?

42:48.160 --> 42:49.685
You gonna kill me now?

42:50.600 --> 42:52.489
You left me in prison.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.923
You did nothing for me.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.963
You were gonna cut a
deal with the Crowes.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.849
You could have
asked for anything!

42:58.960 --> 43:00.450
You wanted a clean slate...

43:00.520 --> 43:01.965
For yourself.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.849
You didn't even ask about me.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.923
I was gonna die in prison, Boyd.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.163
Those girls were gunning for me.

43:08.600 --> 43:11.080
Should I be expected to
fight every single day

43:11.160 --> 43:12.650
for the rest of my life?

43:13.360 --> 43:15.089
Don't you tell me
you wouldn't have done

43:15.160 --> 43:17.367
the same exact goddamn thing.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.409
Are you sleeping
with Raylan Givens?

43:19.760 --> 43:20.841
What?

43:20.960 --> 43:24.123
Are you sleeping with Raylan?

43:25.240 --> 43:26.844
You're gonna ask me that?

43:27.200 --> 43:30.044
'Cause if you are,
take it. Take it!

43:30.120 --> 43:31.531
Take it!

43:31.600 --> 43:33.011
Put a bullet...

43:34.000 --> 43:35.729
In my head right now.
Do it.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.962
No! I didn't...
Do it!

43:38.040 --> 43:40.168
I didn't do anything
with Raylan!

43:40.240 --> 43:42.527
It's you!
It's always been you!

43:44.800 --> 43:46.404
You take it.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.881
And you do whatever
it is you got to do.

44:00.120 --> 44:04.444
I let you down.
And I'm sorry.

44:06.640 --> 44:10.725
I understand what you did...

44:12.280 --> 44:14.408
...why you did it.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.051
I still... love you.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.041
I love you, too, Boyd.

44:26.840 --> 44:31.641
If you would trust me right now,

44:32.240 --> 44:35.005
if you will tell me everything
that you told Raylan Givens...

44:35.080 --> 44:38.084
I mean everything.
I can get us out of this.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.761
I can give him
enough information

44:41.840 --> 44:43.001
to keep him running in circles

44:43.080 --> 44:44.366
until we can get
that money and run.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.363
But I got to trust you.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.169
You can trust me.

44:48.640 --> 44:52.361
And I got to know
that you trust me.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.008
I trust you, Boyd.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.568
I'm gonna go get
some more firewood.

45:57.680 --> 45:59.091
You sure you don't
want me to come with?

45:59.160 --> 46:00.889
No, you better get back to work

46:01.000 --> 46:02.206
before everything
falls apart over there.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.291
So...

46:09.200 --> 46:10.565
We gonna do this, then?

46:11.760 --> 46:13.410
I don't see how we don't try.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.121
What do you give us?
50/50 shot?

46:18.160 --> 46:20.003
51/49.
Oh.

46:20.600 --> 46:21.886
Well, which way?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.570
See you soon?

46:35.800 --> 46:37.768
Yeah. Yes, you will.
