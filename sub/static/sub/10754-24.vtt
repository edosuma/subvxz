00:08.634 --> 00:12.763
Caroline, if you've had therapy
for two years without much progress,

00:12.929 --> 00:15.474
perhaps you've reached a plateau,

00:15.641 --> 00:17.684
or you and your therapist have done

00:17.851 --> 00:19.811
all you can together.

00:19.978 --> 00:24.024
(Caroline) 'Maybe you're right.
He's kind of dry and long-winded.'

00:24.191 --> 00:29.780
That's a long time to spend with a
psychiatrist who's dry and long-winded.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.323
Amen to that.

00:32.491 --> 00:35.994
'Thanks, Dr Crane.
I'll think about that.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.581
'Would it be OK if I called back
and picked your brain?'

00:39.748 --> 00:42.417
Just consider me your mental banjo.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.921
That's it for this fine Friday.

00:46.087 --> 00:50.091
This is Frasier Crane
saying we'll see you next week.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.927
Good show, Frasier.

00:53.094 --> 00:56.389
I've waited for this moment
for an entire week.

01:01.227 --> 01:05.732
That's what I love about you.
You work hard and play hard.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.985
I'm looking forward to this weekend.

01:09.152 --> 01:15.074
Even conscientious psychiatrists
can have their fill of people's problems.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
Hi. Is one of you Roz Doyle?

01:17.827 --> 01:21.039
Yes. That's all the clues you're getting.

01:24.626 --> 01:28.880
A little offering
from one of your suitors, perhaps?

01:29.964 --> 01:33.426
A nice string of pearls,
a teardrop pendant...

01:34.427 --> 01:36.721
It's a brick of cheese!

01:39.182 --> 01:42.727
On the right chain it should look smart.

01:42.894 --> 01:47.648
It's from my family. They're at
my uncle's dairy farm in Wisconsin.

01:47.815 --> 01:51.736
- Why didn't you go?
- There wasn't time. Now I wish I had.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.407
We have such fun.
Once there was this cheese platter

01:56.574 --> 01:58.618
and my uncle spoke in cheese.

01:58.784 --> 02:03.205
Instead of saying, "Hello. How are
you?" He said, "Hello, Havarti?"

02:05.916 --> 02:08.502
Someone else would go, "I'm Gouda."

02:09.919 --> 02:12.089
What would come after that?

02:12.256 --> 02:15.259
lf I'd been there,
the sound of a gunshot.

02:16.635 --> 02:19.221
(Sobbing) Don't make fun.
I miss those people.

02:21.932 --> 02:23.767
There, there.

02:23.934 --> 02:26.687
- We play games and sing songs.
- I know.

02:26.854 --> 02:30.065
And Aunt Libby
does cannonballs into the lake.

02:30.232 --> 02:32.276
The memories must be...

02:32.443 --> 02:37.448
And Uncle Ned has too much to drink
and puts pants on all the cows.

02:38.449 --> 02:43.537
lf you want family fun tonight, why
don't you come to my dad's birthday?

02:43.704 --> 02:46.165
I forgot about it last year.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.293
There's just one rule -
no work, just a good time.

02:49.460 --> 02:53.088
- I wouldn't be much fun.
- I insist.

02:53.255 --> 02:58.010
I enjoy partying with you
and I hate to see you like this.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.804
I Camembert it.

03:02.264 --> 03:03.807
How sweet.

03:10.564 --> 03:14.901
All right! It's someone's birthday.

03:15.068 --> 03:18.989
I hope you're in the mood for a party.
I know I am.

03:19.156 --> 03:21.867
- You're bloody impossible!
- You're a bloody nag!

03:22.034 --> 03:24.119
Don't shake that cane at me!

03:25.620 --> 03:28.165
For heaven's sake, not again.

03:28.331 --> 03:31.668
I know what I want for my birthday.
Fire Daphne.

03:31.835 --> 03:34.504
You'd have to rehire me first. I quit.

03:34.671 --> 03:38.925
I hope I never see that hateful old
canker sore ever again.

03:39.092 --> 03:41.887
- What is it this time?
- The usual.

03:42.053 --> 03:46.224
I ask him to exercise
and he twists his face up like a baby.

03:46.391 --> 03:52.856
You asked by pouring my beer away
and banging a pot with a spoon.

03:53.023 --> 03:56.026
- I don't have to be your friend.
- Good.

03:56.192 --> 03:58.987
I got a friend here
who isn't a yammering nag.

04:00.030 --> 04:03.575
- Eddie, fetch!
- Stop this!

04:03.742 --> 04:08.663
Pick your argument up tomorrow.
Tonight we're having a party.

04:10.915 --> 04:15.462
I went to Emilio's. I got some
lemon cake, snacks, and champagne.

04:15.628 --> 04:18.047
Can we agree to have fun this evening?

04:18.214 --> 04:19.591
(Doorbell)

04:19.757 --> 04:24.596
That'll be Roz. She's down
and in need of a happy environment.

04:24.762 --> 04:29.142
I could use the same thing.
Can you just agree to a truce?

04:29.350 --> 04:31.644
(Both mutter)

04:33.813 --> 04:36.190
- Roz, hello!
- Hi, Frasier.

04:36.357 --> 04:39.235
Hey, Martin. Happy birthday.

04:39.402 --> 04:41.863
You didn't have to do this!

04:43.322 --> 04:45.825
Thanks. I'll model it for you later.

04:45.992 --> 04:48.369
He's already modelling one.

04:48.536 --> 04:50.246
(Doorbell)

04:50.413 --> 04:54.333
I have a nice evening planned.
Can we try to be civil?

04:55.293 --> 04:58.129
You unprincipled charlatan!

04:58.296 --> 05:01.299
You unconscionable fraud!

05:01.465 --> 05:03.467
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thanks.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.886
What are you talking about?

05:06.053 --> 05:08.723
You spoke to a patient of mine today.
Caroline.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.395
Due to your fast-food approach
to psychiatry, she left me.

05:16.188 --> 05:18.607
Caroline was your patient? I...

05:19.442 --> 05:25.239
Two years of my hard work wiped out
by your two-minute McSession.

05:27.825 --> 05:31.453
I merely suggested
she consider a change.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.874
Based on what diagnostic method?
One potato, two potato?

05:35.708 --> 05:39.712
Fancy that. A member of this family
not taking the time to do something.

05:39.878 --> 05:43.882
- Quack!
- Exactly, Dad. Quack!

05:44.049 --> 05:47.261
- I was talking to her.
- Don't you raise your cane at her.

05:55.686 --> 05:58.897
Wait! Roz, where are you going?

06:01.608 --> 06:05.737
- I think I'd better leave.
- We were just talking.

06:05.904 --> 06:11.743
I'd just rather be by myself.
Thanks, guys. I had a wonderful time.

06:13.996 --> 06:17.916
- You've ruined her evening.
- Her evening? It's my birthday.

06:18.083 --> 06:22.713
Let's get that underway.
Who's ready for cake?

06:23.964 --> 06:28.593
I don't want to keep you all here,
so let's get this over with.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.263
Thanks for a great party!

06:33.223 --> 06:36.101
(Niles) There's nothing wrong
with Dad's lungs.

06:38.687 --> 06:42.440
(Daphne) Every light in the city is out.
It must be a blackout.

06:42.607 --> 06:46.695
(Frasier) There's worse places to be.
(Niles) Like the elevator... Roz!

06:46.862 --> 06:48.947
(Martin) Why couldn't it be Daphne?

06:49.114 --> 06:53.243
(Martin yells after a crash)
Stop doing that!

06:57.080 --> 07:00.625
(Daphne) We need to get some light.
(Martin) Eddie, where are you?

07:00.792 --> 07:03.920
(Daphne) Excuse me, Dr Crane.
(Niles) Quite all right, Daphne.

07:04.087 --> 07:07.882
(Frasier) Where are the lamps?
(Daphne) They're in the kitchen.

07:08.049 --> 07:11.428
(Frasier) Dad, light a fire.
(Daphne) Excuse me, Dr Crane.

07:11.594 --> 07:13.721
(Niles) Not your fault, Daphne.

07:14.806 --> 07:16.850
(Martin) Where are you, Eddie?

07:17.016 --> 07:18.476
(Eddie growls)

07:18.643 --> 07:20.895
(Frasier) I've found him!

07:21.062 --> 07:23.356
(Daphne) That's better.

07:23.523 --> 07:26.025
I'll get my radio. See what's going on.

07:27.902 --> 07:30.238
Roz, are you all right?

07:30.405 --> 07:35.243
I'm fine. The blackout hit as the elevator
opened on the 14th floor.

07:35.410 --> 07:40.415
I stood there trying to decide
whether to come back up here,

07:40.581 --> 07:44.794
or take my chances in the streets
with the muggers and the weirdos.

07:46.129 --> 07:48.589
So I went down a couple of flights...

07:50.550 --> 07:52.593
then I changed my mind.

07:53.553 --> 07:56.013
Somebody's probably
looting my apartment.

07:56.180 --> 08:00.810
There's a thriving black market
in badly designed Formica tables.

08:02.061 --> 08:04.522
At least I have my own sense of style.

08:04.689 --> 08:10.278
You won't buy a chair unless a fey
French aristocrat sat his fat fanny in it.

08:10.444 --> 08:14.073
Louis XIV was not fey.
Everyone wore garters then.

08:14.240 --> 08:17.410
- lf they were fey they did.
- He was a big man.

08:17.576 --> 08:20.121
(French accent) Silence, enfants!

08:22.081 --> 08:26.961
We can all sit in the dark and be
miserable or we can try having fun.

08:27.128 --> 08:30.548
- I'll call Maris.
- Niles has voted. Who votes for fun?

08:32.299 --> 08:34.342
I'm going to go get a glass of wine.

08:34.510 --> 08:38.597
The steaks we were having are out.
I'll see what I can find.

08:39.472 --> 08:42.476
- Sorry, Dr Crane.
- Excuse me, Daphne.

08:42.643 --> 08:45.729
Power's out all over Seattle.
They're working on it.

08:45.896 --> 08:51.193
Thank God I got you. Don't panic.
It's important to stay calm.

08:52.569 --> 08:54.613
About the blackout.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.241
Maris, take off your slumber mask.

08:59.326 --> 09:03.747
No, darling, don't panic. Honey.
No, honey, we're... Honey.

09:07.376 --> 09:09.837
She's fine.

09:14.758 --> 09:16.844
Yum scrum, pig's bum.

09:17.010 --> 09:21.431
Here's something nice -
half-gallon tubs of vanilla fudge.

09:22.432 --> 09:26.228
Let's have these right away
before they melt.

09:26.395 --> 09:28.397
They'll stay cold for at least 24 hours.

09:28.563 --> 09:30.315
Shut up!

09:31.525 --> 09:36.571
I don't like to be nostalgic, but it
was great when you forgot my birthday.

09:39.699 --> 09:42.953
What we need to do
is liven things up a little bit.

09:43.120 --> 09:46.373
A game. What was it we played
at the Vanderkelins

09:46.540 --> 09:50.502
while they costumed the servants
for the living chess match?

09:51.586 --> 09:54.840
I remember!
It was "I'm the dullest person".

09:55.006 --> 09:58.009
Pick a game someone else
has a chance of winning.

10:01.137 --> 10:04.975
That's got things shaking.
Come on, Dad. Come on.

10:05.141 --> 10:07.602
The object is, we all get pennies

10:07.769 --> 10:10.563
and we try to get
the other person's pennies.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.816
Please, slow down!

10:13.983 --> 10:17.445
All right, if I were going to go
I would say,

10:17.612 --> 10:22.534
"I am the dullest because
I've never been on a roller coaster".

10:22.700 --> 10:27.080
Everyone who has been on
a roller coaster would give me a penny.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.707
Now, we all have our pennies.

10:30.959 --> 10:35.171
- Will you go first, Daphne?
- I can't think of anything.

10:35.338 --> 10:39.884
Say whatever comes to mind.
"I'm the dullest person because..."

10:40.051 --> 10:44.764
Because I've never made love
in a lift or a phone booth

10:44.931 --> 10:48.267
or on an airplane or a merry-go-round.

10:48.434 --> 10:52.730
That's good, but it should be something
someone might have...

10:54.816 --> 10:56.901
done.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:09.789 --> 11:13.125
I was in college.
I was trying to find myself.

11:14.126 --> 11:17.463
You just needed
to look under the nearest man.

11:20.049 --> 11:22.593
All right, Dad, get our pennies.

11:22.760 --> 11:27.223
I'm the dullest person
because I've never been to France.

11:27.390 --> 11:31.560
That's the spirit.
Niles? Something you've never done.

11:31.727 --> 11:35.815
I'm dull because I've never
sabotaged my brother's career.

11:35.981 --> 11:39.860
- Give it a rest!
- Your father could show you how.

11:41.195 --> 11:43.239
(Arguing)

11:44.490 --> 11:50.246
Will you stop? You are torturing
me! I could report you to Amnesty!

11:51.872 --> 11:55.501
- I'm out of here.
- Where are you going?

11:55.668 --> 12:00.673
To sit in the tub with a hair dryer
waiting for the power to come back on (!)

12:00.839 --> 12:05.719
This blackout could go on all night.
I'll brave the streets and get back.

12:05.886 --> 12:08.889
I hope it isn't like that storm.

12:09.056 --> 12:14.311
I had to coax Maris from under the bed
by tying a Prozac to some string.

12:20.484 --> 12:23.987
- You want to have a little cake?
- No, thanks.

12:25.489 --> 12:29.910
This reminds me of Wisconsin -
all dark and deserted.

12:30.077 --> 12:32.829
Isn't that on the licence plate?

12:34.873 --> 12:38.335
What's the real reason
you didn't go? You've made it before.

12:39.836 --> 12:42.255
Well... No.

12:42.422 --> 12:46.385
You don't want to hear any more
problems and I don't blame you.

12:46.551 --> 12:51.181
I think we have time
for one more caller.

12:53.892 --> 12:59.689
Well, every year I go to my reunion
and my relatives crowd around me

12:59.856 --> 13:02.359
and I answer the same questions.

13:02.526 --> 13:06.112
"No, I'm not married."
"No, I don't have kids."

13:06.279 --> 13:09.866
"Yes, I still have that tattoo.
No, you can't see it."

13:12.494 --> 13:16.206
It'd be nice if I could at least say,
"I have a great career."

13:16.373 --> 13:18.833
You do have a great career.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.797
Tell them that. They say I spend
four hours on the phone every day

13:23.963 --> 13:26.299
with a bunch of losers and whackos

13:26.466 --> 13:31.471
and then some tedious know-it-all
gives them pointless advice.

13:35.225 --> 13:38.561
That's not me talking.
That's my Uncle Ned.

13:38.728 --> 13:40.980
The cow haberdasher.

13:43.066 --> 13:47.445
Roz, ten years ago,
KACL didn't have any women producers.

13:48.613 --> 13:53.326
You're a pioneer. You've won awards.
You help people.

13:55.161 --> 13:57.246
Sounds right when you say it.

13:57.413 --> 14:02.043
There's more than your job. You should
explore other areas of your life -

14:02.210 --> 14:05.505
interests,
or maybe a serious relationship.

14:06.714 --> 14:08.841
Maybe you're right.

14:09.008 --> 14:13.763
How long can I chase 25-year-olds
that are all looks and no substance?

14:13.930 --> 14:18.351
- Exactly, Roz.
- I'm asking. Three, four years?

14:18.976 --> 14:20.811
(Crash)

14:20.978 --> 14:25.024
- (Daphne) Oh, bloody hell!
- Daphne, are you all right?

14:25.191 --> 14:28.694
I broke Martin's souvenir spoon rest
from Atlantic City.

14:28.861 --> 14:31.405
Oh, good.

14:31.572 --> 14:36.744
When I have my own kitchen I'll put
my spoons right on the damn counter.

14:36.911 --> 14:41.749
I've always said,
when I save $2,000 I'll get a place.

14:41.916 --> 14:44.502
- How much have you saved?
- 4,000.

14:44.668 --> 14:50.132
I know what you're thinking.
What's wrong with me? Why do I stay?

14:50.299 --> 14:53.093
I was thinking I'm overpaying you.

14:55.387 --> 15:00.142
My friends say, "You should be on
your own, have a place, have a life."

15:01.143 --> 15:03.687
Why do I stay here?

15:03.854 --> 15:07.650
Could it be that maybe you...
you like us?

15:09.151 --> 15:14.364
My grandmother had a cat, a mangy
old thing, kept ruining the furniture.

15:14.531 --> 15:16.742
I asked her why she kept it

15:16.909 --> 15:23.373
and she said she liked having
another heartbeat in the house.

15:24.583 --> 15:27.753
It just makes me feel
like I'm unambitious.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.381
I could work in a hospital or a clinic.

15:31.548 --> 15:35.135
Maybe that's not
what's important to you right now.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.972
You like being part of a family.
What's wrong with that?

15:40.223 --> 15:42.559
Nothing, I suppose.

15:42.726 --> 15:47.606
Although my friends wonder how
I can live with such demanding men.

15:47.773 --> 15:52.069
- They call me demanding?
- No, they call you a pompous ass.

15:54.738 --> 15:59.493
- But you've learned that I'm not.
- No, I've learned to work around it.

16:00.202 --> 16:02.245
I'm getting a beer.

16:02.412 --> 16:08.335
I know it's bad for me, will make me
fat, and keep me from exercising.

16:08.501 --> 16:13.506
- You have anything to add to that?
- Yes. Happy birthday, you old sod.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.222
They try to confuse you on purpose.

16:27.020 --> 16:32.233
Room temperature. Just like England -
another place I'll never get to.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.862
You mentioned going to Europe
when your hip improved.

16:36.029 --> 16:39.157
Now you say you'll never get there.
What's changed?

16:39.324 --> 16:41.618
My hip's the same as then.

16:41.784 --> 16:46.664
I thought I'd be better
but I'm not and probably never will be.

16:46.831 --> 16:53.171
You're happy just sitting on your can,
doing your show, living in your head.

16:53.338 --> 16:56.132
I'm used to being out there.

16:57.675 --> 16:59.427
Eddie!

17:07.643 --> 17:09.854
Listen, Dad,

17:10.021 --> 17:12.190
you can still travel.

17:12.356 --> 17:17.194
No, you can. lf you can't
walk around Paris, you could...

17:17.361 --> 17:22.491
sit at a nice café
and let Paris walk past you.

17:22.657 --> 17:26.244
Maybe buy a drink
for a beautiful mademoiselle.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.706
Get a nice bottle of imported beer.

17:28.873 --> 17:34.128
- I only like Ballantine's.
- In Paris, Ballantine's is imported.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.717
And you are the
handsome <i>Américain...</i>

17:39.884 --> 17:42.303
with the adorable accent.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.726
They like moustaches, don't they?

17:55.566 --> 18:00.446
(Breathless) 19 floors down to my car.
Garage door's electric. Can't open.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.115
20 floors back up. Lost count.

18:03.282 --> 18:07.286
Bad lady upstairs. Big dog.
Need place to die.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.417
- (Roz) Same to you, buddy!
- Who are you talking to?

18:13.584 --> 18:17.880
Some rowdy guys downstairs.
Come on, I want you to introduce us.

18:20.090 --> 18:23.552
- Keep your pants on.
- Let me take your coat.

18:24.845 --> 18:29.183
- Haven't you taken enough from me?
- You're being irrational.

18:29.349 --> 18:32.144
- Sticks and stones.
- You're acting like Dad.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.855
You take that back!

18:37.774 --> 18:41.862
You're not really mad at me.
I didn't tell her to leave you.

18:42.029 --> 18:46.116
I merely suggested it as an option.
It was her choice.

18:46.283 --> 18:50.037
Could it be you're upset
because you couldn't help her?

18:50.203 --> 18:54.583
I hate it when you take a criticism
and turn it back on me.

18:54.750 --> 18:59.129
- I think I'm right.
- You are. That's why I hate it.

19:01.465 --> 19:05.886
Do you know what I went through
trying to help her?

19:06.052 --> 19:08.305
Yes, I think I do.

19:08.471 --> 19:12.225
Niles, you're a perfectionist.

19:14.102 --> 19:16.605
As faults go,
that's not such a bad one.

19:16.771 --> 19:21.943
Just would've been nice if I'd been
the one to say it was time to go.

19:22.110 --> 19:26.990
Instead, she heard it from a glib,
albeit insightful, radio pundit.

19:29.534 --> 19:32.579
Those guys
invited us to a blackout party.

19:32.746 --> 19:35.457
- They got cold beer.
- And Jarlsberg.

19:35.623 --> 19:39.711
I was feeling a bit down,
but suddenly I'm in a party mood.

19:39.878 --> 19:43.798
- What about our party?
- There are people downstairs.

19:43.965 --> 19:47.886
- Come on, Frasier.
- No, thank you. I'm not in the mood.

19:48.052 --> 19:53.057
- Don't be a party-pooper.
- Let him be. He was always that way.

19:53.224 --> 19:58.479
Maybe it's time for a lesson about
living the life of this party-pooper.

19:58.646 --> 20:02.400
I spend the whole week
ministering to the troubled,

20:02.567 --> 20:05.653
the neurotic
and the sometimes plain goofy.

20:06.571 --> 20:09.991
Then I hang up my earphones
and it doesn't end there.

20:10.158 --> 20:13.745
On the street, at the café
even in this building...

20:13.911 --> 20:16.497
more people come up for help.

20:16.664 --> 20:19.625
They think it's OK. It's what I do.

20:19.792 --> 20:24.672
But every time I help them
it costs me a piece of myself.

20:24.839 --> 20:27.633
A little here, a little there...

20:27.800 --> 20:33.222
Till I feel like a zebra carcass on
the Serengeti surrounded by vultures.

20:35.641 --> 20:38.144
This was one of those weeks.

20:39.228 --> 20:43.816
I had my escape planned. I was coming
for an evening of fun with my family.

20:43.983 --> 20:49.530
But I get you four going at each
other like the Borgias on a bad day.

20:51.657 --> 20:53.701
So I roll up my sleeves,

20:53.868 --> 20:58.038
tending to each one of you,
and you all feel better.

20:58.205 --> 21:01.917
The minute you get the whiff
of mesquite from down below...

21:03.294 --> 21:07.756
you are out the door
without so much as a "thank you".

21:08.632 --> 21:13.554
Well, thank you for the invitation,
but I'm fed up with people's problems.

21:13.721 --> 21:16.140
The doctor is out.

21:16.307 --> 21:18.434
Oh, come on.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.979
- Apologies accepted.
- Great! So you'll come?

21:23.689 --> 21:25.190
No, no...

21:25.357 --> 21:28.026
I love you all. I really do.

21:28.193 --> 21:32.573
But I want to be alone, here,
where no one needs anything from me.

21:32.739 --> 21:37.077
- Well, all right.
- I'll bring you some barbecue.

21:38.662 --> 21:40.706
Oh, my God. It's dark out here.

21:52.092 --> 21:54.594
Oh, for God's sake.

21:54.761 --> 21:57.347
No, I'm not going to do it.

22:13.738 --> 22:16.074
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling

22:16.241 --> 22:19.327
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.494 --> 22:20.745
# Quite stylish!

22:20.912 --> 22:22.831
# Maybe I seem a bit confused

22:22.998 --> 22:27.877
# Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.044 --> 22:30.130
# But I don't know what to do with those

22:30.297 --> 22:33.717
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.883 --> 22:36.177
# They're calling again #

22:36.344 --> 22:39.013
Frasier has left the building.
