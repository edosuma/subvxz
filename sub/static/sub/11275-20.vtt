00:25.207 --> 00:26.440
          Yes, Carla?

  I seem to be a little short.  

00:28.477 --> 00:31.412

      a warm personality.

 When you added up my paycheck, 

00:33.382 --> 00:37.219
  I think you forgot to count   
 a couple of fingers and toes.  

00:37.253 --> 00:38.653

            three quarters hours

00:40.389 --> 00:41.456

                  last week.

          trick that I use.     

00:51.767 --> 00:53.134
            I set my watch ahead

00:53.169 --> 00:54.369
                 a half an hour.

00:54.403 --> 00:56.872

      getting someplace on time,

00:56.906 --> 00:58.106
                  I'm actually  
                  fooling myself

good business sense, boss.      

01:02.345 --> 01:04.578
I guess if I set my watch       
         an hour ahead,         

01:04.613 --> 01:06.314
  it'd be twice as good, huh?   

01:06.316 --> 01:07.281

start taking Sam to lunch?

to put Sam

that I have what it takes,

    ( <i>clears throat</i> )

    the executive washroom,

         and I splashed

  and I looked in the mirror,
