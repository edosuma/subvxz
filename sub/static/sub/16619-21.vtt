Seeing that we work stronger together,

35:49.256 --> 35:50.957
instead of against one another.

35:50.991 --> 35:52.892
So, we will not only rebuild

35:52.926 --> 35:56.128
both our intelligence
agencies from scratch,

35:56.163 --> 35:57.897
we will combine them to help rebuild

35:57.931 --> 36:00.199
the faith and trust
of the American people.

36:00.233 --> 36:01.634
It's time our country unites,

36:01.668 --> 36:03.469
and the Constitutional convention

36:03.503 --> 36:04.737
in 100 days

36:04.771 --> 36:08.207
will be a bold step in that process.

36:08.241 --> 36:11.043
We not only can be safe and free,

36:11.078 --> 36:12.411
we will be.

36:12.446 --> 36:14.380
We are the United States of America,

36:14.414 --> 36:16.194
and we hold our freedoms close.

36:16.197 --> 36:17.316
We protect them.

36:17.351 --> 36:20.720
We must always be the

36:20.754 --> 36:22.555

Woman: Mr. President, how long...

36:24.257 --> 36:26.859
Instead of silencing us,
he's using us as an example,

36:26.893 --> 36:29.161
to dismantle the FBI and the CIA.

36:29.196 --> 36:30.529
Give himself all the power.

36:30.564 --> 36:31.931
It's from crashing?

36:31.934 --> 36:33.946
Well, he'd have torn
down the CIA and the FBI

36:33.949 --> 36:35.352
<i>because</i> we failed.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.928
This was always the plan.

36:36.963 --> 36:38.230

36:38.264 --> 36:39.831
We're heroes, we're villains.
