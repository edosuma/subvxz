01:13.407 --> 01:15.909
<i>There are gajillions of stories...</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:18.120
<i>of mischief and fun,</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:20.080
<i>but to keep things simple,</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:22.791
<i>let's start with just one...</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:25.419
<i>about a mom and two kids...</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.713
<i>and a house and a hat...</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:29.715
<i>that, oddly enough,</i>

01:29.798 --> 01:32.092
<i>was worn by a cat.</i>

01:32.217 --> 01:36.180
<i>But soon enough
we will get to all that.</i>

01:36.305 --> 01:40.184
<i>In the valley that stretches
from this hill to that hill,</i>

01:40.309 --> 01:42.311
<i>a city is nestled...</i>

01:42.394 --> 01:45.480
<i>that city is Anville.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.816
- Hurry up!
We'll miss the movie!
- Any more tutti-frutti?

01:47.983 --> 01:48.901
I'll check.
Thanks!

01:48.984 --> 01:53.197
<i>It's a town that's not huge,
but quite big enough...</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:56.491
<i>for buyers and sellers
to sell and buy stuff,</i>

01:56.617 --> 01:59.286
<i>from shoes and shirts...</i>

01:59.411 --> 02:01.580
<i>and elongated ladders...</i>

02:01.705 --> 02:05.918
<i>to sailboats and gibble-grated
berry-juice bladders.</i>

02:07.503 --> 02:12.883
<i>So our story begins
at the corner
of Main and Montroob...</i>

02:13.008 --> 02:15.385
<i>in the spotless
real estate office...</i>

02:15.511 --> 02:19.097
<i>run by Hank Humberfloob.</i>

02:20.098 --> 02:22.893
<i>Humberfloob Real Estate. How can
we make your dreams come true?</i>

02:29.608 --> 02:30.984
What do you mean,
you're leaving?

02:31.109 --> 02:34.488
You're a babysitter.
Babysitters don't leave. They sit.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.491
Baby-leavers leave.
I'm sorry. I really
gotta go, Miss Walden.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.494
Well, I need to come home
right away.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.205
All right.
Thank you, Amy.
Sorry.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.711
Attention, everyone!
It's 9:02.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.005
Staff meeting!
Staff meeting!

02:52.089 --> 02:55.092
<i>Look alive, everyone!</i>

02:55.217 --> 02:57.219
First I'd like to
welcome aboard...

02:57.386 --> 03:00.514
our newest member
of the Humberfloob family,

03:00.597 --> 03:02.808
Jim McFlinnagan!

03:02.891 --> 03:04.685
- Mr. Humberfloob,
I wanted to thank you...

03:04.810 --> 03:06.812
Fired.
I beg your pardon?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.314
Fired.
B-But l...

03:09.398 --> 03:13.610
Fired!

03:16.488 --> 03:19.491
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10!

03:21.994 --> 03:25.998
As you know, tonight is
our bimonthly “meet and greet" party.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.585
Tonight's host is...
Joan Walden.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.714
This is where people can
meet our real estate agents...

03:33.797 --> 03:37.718
in an informal,
yet hygienic setting.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.804
Mr. Humberfloob,
I have to get home to my kids.

03:42.181 --> 03:44.183
Ah, yes.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.020
Your children.

03:48.103 --> 03:52.316
Joan, let me make this
perfectly clear.

03:52.399 --> 03:57.112
If your house
is as messy as last time,

03:57.196 --> 04:00.199
you're fired!

04:02.284 --> 04:05.913
That's pretty clear,
Mr. Humberfloob.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.915
Don't worry. I promise.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.417
My kids'll be
on their best behavior.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.212
Great.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.089
<i>Humberfloob Real Estate.</i>

04:17.216 --> 04:20.093
<i>How can we make
your dreams come true?
Please hold.</i>

04:20.219 --> 04:24.181
<i>If you leave Humberfloob's
and turn left onto Main,</i>

04:24.306 --> 04:28.810
<i>three miles down
you'll find Lipplapper Lane,</i>

04:28.894 --> 04:32.314
<i>a pleasant-enough street
in a pleasant-enough way...</i>

04:32.481 --> 04:36.818
<i>where a neighbor greeted neighbor
with a neighborly "Hey!"</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:38.403
Hey!
Hey!

04:38.403 --> 04:42.783
<i>Here the hedges were hedged,
the weeds were all weeded,</i>

04:42.908 --> 04:45.285
<i>and lawns were mowed daily,</i>

04:45.410 --> 04:48.288
<i>twice daily if needed.</i>

04:48.413 --> 04:50.582
<i>And at the end
of this street,</i>

04:50.707 --> 04:52.918
<i>in a house like any other,</i>

04:53.001 --> 04:55.087
<i>something magical
would happen...</i>

04:55.212 --> 04:58.298
<i>to a sister and her brother.</i>

05:07.516 --> 05:10.310
<i>Shh! Nevins!
Stealth mode.</i>

05:10.394 --> 05:12.312
Today's to-do list.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.815
Number one:
Make to-do list.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.192
Number two:
Practice coloring.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.112
Number three:
Research graduate schools.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.906
Number four:
Be spontaneous.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.493
Number five:
Create lasting
childhood memories.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.788
<i>And number six:
Amend will.</i>

05:31.081 --> 05:33.417
What is he doing?

05:51.310 --> 05:54.313
Number 10:
Make tomorrow's to-do list.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.319
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

06:00.402 --> 06:02.196
Nevins,
your attention, please.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.282
You are about to witness
the third most spectacular stunt...

06:05.407 --> 06:07.784
ever performed
under this roof!

06:07.910 --> 06:11.496
Do you know how hard it's getting
to tell people that we're related?

06:11.705 --> 06:15.083
Relax.
I'll put everything back.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.804
And now,
for the indoor stair luge!

06:27.888 --> 06:29.806
Indoor stair luge?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.100
I'll have to add this one
to my list.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.895
Go have no fun
somewhere else.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.482
<i>It... is... showtime!</i>

06:41.109 --> 06:43.487
<i>Whoa!</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:48.784
- Aah!
- Yeah!

06:50.494 --> 06:53.080
<i>- Oh, my word!</i>

06:53.205 --> 06:55.082
Nevins!

06:55.207 --> 06:58.502
<i>Nevins, come back!</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:01.880
Hey, Mom. What's up?

07:05.509 --> 07:08.387
You are so lucky
you didn't ruin this dress.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.014
Mom, I know
you're angry,

07:11.098 --> 07:13.016
but there's something
you need to know.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.686
This was all Sally's fault.
Oh, really?

07:15.811 --> 07:18.188
And how, exactly,
was it Sally's fault?

07:18.313 --> 07:20.315
Give me a minute.
I'm workin' on it.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.818
Save it, Conrad.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.988
Why today? Why did you
have to pick today
to destroy the house?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.990
You know
what's happening today.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.992
I tried to tell him, Mom.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.494
"Mom's throwing
a very important party," I said.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.496
"All other important
clients will be here."

07:34.580 --> 07:38.292
But he went right ahead
and wrecked the house
and let Nevins get away.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.003
Now, again, I hope
you're going to ground him.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.797
Yes, Sally, for a week, but
that's none of your business.

07:43.881 --> 07:45.799
A week?
Come on. Two days.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.302
I asked you to do
one thing today, Conrad...

07:48.385 --> 07:50.304
keep the house
clean.

07:50.512 --> 07:55.309
Do you know how frustrating it is
that you're always doing
the exact opposite of what I say?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.519
<i>Knock, knock, knock.</i>

07:57.603 --> 07:59.813
Someone lose a dog?

07:59.897 --> 08:01.815
<i>I found him next door...</i>

08:01.899 --> 08:03.817
in my yard... again.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.320
You are a saint.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.198
And here I thought
you were only dating me
for my good looks.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.700
Lucky us.
Larry Quinn is here.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.912
<i>Hey-a, sport.
Call me Lawrence.
Okay?</i>

08:14.995 --> 08:17.998
You rescued Nevins!
Thanks, Lawrence!

08:18.081 --> 08:20.918
It was my pleasure, Sally.
Anything for my little princess.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.586
Oh, I don't wanna be a princess.

08:22.711 --> 08:26.381
In a constitutional monarchy
parliament has all the real power.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.718
I see.
Okay, that's great.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.887
Uh, look, pal, be a sport.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.890
<i>Why don't you go
tidy up the living room.
Okay...dude?</i>

08:36.015 --> 08:37.808
I don't have to listen to you, Larry.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.187
Conrad,
do what Lawrence says.

08:53.283 --> 08:57.204
Have you given some thought
about the Wilhelm Academy?

08:57.287 --> 09:00.415
You mean the Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy for Troubled Youth?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.001
That's the one, Joan.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.296
I'm not sure
it's right for Conrad.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.883
Oh, Joan, Joan.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.511
Joan, Joan, Joan.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.306
I have so much respect
for you, Joan.

09:16.390 --> 09:20.018
Single mother, career woman,
raising two children on your own,

09:20.102 --> 09:24.398
and still finding time
to be the best darned
real estate agent in town.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.819
I know how hard it is, Joan.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.489
It is hard.
Oh... I know.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.617
<i>And I know
how hard you're trying.</i>

09:37.411 --> 09:40.080
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
proposition,
and you must act now.

09:40.205 --> 09:43.083
The Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy
for Troubled Youth...

09:43.208 --> 09:46.003
is what we call in the sales game
a win-win scenario.

09:46.086 --> 09:50.799
A top-flight military school,
and it's only... eight hours away.

09:52.801 --> 09:56.096
<i>Oh, the phone.</i>

10:04.396 --> 10:06.315
I heard what you said.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.317
I'm not going to military school, Larry.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.903
Look, buddy,

10:10.986 --> 10:13.906
I know I'm not your dad...

10:13.989 --> 10:16.909
and this is probably
really strange for you...

10:16.992 --> 10:18.702
your neighbor's
dating your mom.

10:18.702 --> 10:22.289
But here's the thing, son.
Come here.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.791
I don't like you either.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.503
But I'm gonna
marry your mom.

10:27.586 --> 10:31.798
And if it was up to me,
you'd be at military school today.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.301
I'm not going
to military school.
Ohh!

10:34.510 --> 10:36.386
I think you're gonna love it.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.388
It's just like summer camp,

10:38.514 --> 10:40.390
except with brutal forced marches...

10:40.516 --> 10:42.392
and soul-crushing discipline.

10:42.518 --> 10:47.105
And one more thing...
It's Lawrence,
you snot-nosed son of a...

10:47.189 --> 10:50.108
wonderful woman
who I'm absolutely crazy about!
Oww!

10:50.192 --> 10:52.110
Gosh, I love children!

10:52.194 --> 10:54.112
Oh, Joan,
I didn't see you there.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.907
Would you be a doll
and help me bring up chairs
from the basement?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.618
Nothing would give me
more pleasure, Joan,
but I do have to run.

10:59.618 --> 11:02.496
I have a very important
sales conference downtown.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.915
Oh. Okay.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.709
- Well, I'll see you at the party tonight.
- Sure.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.110
Mom, that guy's a total phony.
You can't let Larry...

11:33.193 --> 11:36.113
<i>It's Lawrence, Conrad.</i>

11:36.905 --> 11:39.408
Kate's Catering.
I'm here to do your party tonight.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.119
Oh, hi.
Where's Kate?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.289
I'm Kate.
Oh. Okay.

11:45.414 --> 11:47.291
Right this way, Kate.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.001
<i>Mom, you've gotta
listen to me...</i>

11:49.084 --> 11:51.503
Quiet!
Two weeks ago
you said you would...

11:51.712 --> 11:53.881
I "specialed" it.
See?

11:54.006 --> 11:57.092
Quiet!
Nevins!

11:57.217 --> 11:59.219
I said quiet!

12:02.806 --> 12:06.894
Joan Walden Real Estate.
Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like Joan.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.104
This is Mr. Humberfloob.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.983
- Oh, hi, Mr. Humberfloob.
- Joan, I need you to come back to the office.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.402
<i>- Today?
- Yes, Joan.</i>

12:15.485 --> 12:18.113
- No problem?
- No problem at all.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.115
Great!

12:20.199 --> 12:22.618
- What's going on, Mommy?

12:22.701 --> 12:26.497
Mommy has to go
back to the office.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.291
Oh! I hope Mrs. Kwan
can baby-sit.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.002
<i>- Not Mrs. Kwan!</i>

12:34.296 --> 12:36.215
Oh!
Hi, Mrs. Kwan.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.217
Hi.
I'm running late.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.220
Thanks for babysitting
on such short notice.
Mmm, yeah.

12:41.303 --> 12:43.305
Okay, Mrs. Kwan.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.806
Oh-oh-oh!

12:44.890 --> 12:47.601
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.
Hi.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.312
<i>Conrad's grounded,
so no video games.</i>

12:50.521 --> 12:52.397
<i>Sally?
Last chance.</i>

12:52.481 --> 12:55.484
If you wanna make cupcakes,
I can take you to
your friend Ginny's house.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.486
<i>- Ginny's not my friend anymore.</i>

12:57.611 --> 13:00.280
<i>Last time we made cupcakes
she wanted to be the head chef.</i>

13:00.405 --> 13:02.282
<i>I'm the head chef.</i>

13:02.407 --> 13:04.117
What about Denise, then?

13:04.201 --> 13:06.995
She talked back to me,
so I ordered her
not to speak to me anymore.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.207
- And you don't like bossy?
- I won't tolerate it.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.917
Right.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.795
Well, if you're both staying,
remember the rules.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.006
Conrad: No playing ball
in the house, no fighting,

13:18.090 --> 13:20.008
no answering the phone,
"City morgue."

13:20.092 --> 13:22.010
Mommy,
can't I have some rules?

13:23.595 --> 13:25.597
No chewing tobacco.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.683
Thanks, Mom.
You have my word.

13:27.808 --> 13:33.105
And absolutely no one
sets foot in the living room, or else.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.817
<i>Or else what?
You're gonna do what Larry said
and send me to military school?</i>

13:36.900 --> 13:40.320
Maybe if you'd just behave,
I wouldn't have to consider military school.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.406
I wish I could trust you.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.993
I wish I had a different mom.

13:46.118 --> 13:49.496
Well, sometimes
I wish the same thing.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.389
Mmm.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.189
Good luck with your meeting.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.798
<i>Children, would you like
to watch television with me?</i>

14:41.882 --> 14:46.303
<i>- We don't have to tell your mother.</i>

14:53.685 --> 14:56.813
<i>Taiwanese parliament.</i>

14:56.897 --> 15:00.609
<i>You tell them, Kwi-Chang!
No more big government!</i>

15:00.817 --> 15:02.486
<i>Rip his heart out!</i>

15:15.499 --> 15:17.709
Hit me!

15:20.003 --> 15:22.381
<i>So they slumped in their chairs,</i>

15:22.506 --> 15:24.591
<i>too glum to complain,</i>

15:24.591 --> 15:28.220
<i>and to make matters worse,
it started to rain.</i>

15:31.598 --> 15:33.517
<i>They sat in the house...</i>

15:33.600 --> 15:36.019
<i>on that cold, cold, wet day...</i>

15:36.186 --> 15:38.105
<i>with no fun to have...</i>

15:38.188 --> 15:40.107
<i>and no games to play.</i>

15:40.190 --> 15:42.192
<i>They could just
stare out the window...</i>

15:42.317 --> 15:44.486
<i>or perhaps get a nap in,</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:46.780
<i>and hope that something,</i>

15:46.905 --> 15:48.782
<i>anything might happen.</i>

15:48.907 --> 15:50.492
Quit bothering
the fish.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.995
I know.
Quit bothering the fish.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.496
Spit hand!
Oh, gross!

15:54.580 --> 15:59.001
Get that away from me!
Get it away!

15:59.084 --> 16:01.587
<i>Then something went bump.</i>

16:01.712 --> 16:03.505
- What was that?

16:03.589 --> 16:06.884
<i>How that bump
made them jump.</i>

16:07.009 --> 16:10.220
<i>I think it came
from the closet.</i>

16:41.919 --> 16:43.795
Conrad?

16:43.921 --> 16:46.215
Conrad.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.801
Come on, Conrad.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.184
You shouldn't scare people.

16:57.309 --> 17:00.312
You should've seen
the look on your face.
It was like you saw a monster...

17:00.395 --> 17:02.689
A monster? Where?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.986
That could've gone better.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.618
<i>What was that?
I don't know.</i>

17:15.786 --> 17:17.913
<i>Looked like
a humongous cat.</i>

17:18.997 --> 17:20.207
"Humongous"?

17:20.290 --> 17:23.794
I prefer the term "big-boned" or “jolly."
Now, what are we hiding from?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.888
<i>That was a giant cat.</i>

17:35.013 --> 17:36.890
But that's impossible,
isn't it?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.892
It's entirely
impossible.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.395
You know,
I like this hiding place
a lot better.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.897
<i>They'll never
find us here.</i>

17:45.315 --> 17:47.192
Scream and run.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.695
And there they go.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.283
Who are you?

17:54.408 --> 17:56.410
Who? Me?

17:56.618 --> 18:00.789
Why, I'm the Cat in the Hat.
There's no doubt about that.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.292
I'm a "super-fun-diferous" feline...

18:03.417 --> 18:06.003
who's here to make sure
that you're...

18:07.880 --> 18:11.592
Meeline? Key lime?

18:11.717 --> 18:14.595
Turpentine?

18:14.720 --> 18:16.597
I got nothin'.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.100
I'm not so good with the rhyming.
Not really, no.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.812
Look, I'm a cat
that can talk.

18:24.021 --> 18:27.399
That should be enough
for you people!

18:27.608 --> 18:30.194
<i>I can talk!
I'm a cat! Yes!</i>

18:30.402 --> 18:32.112
Where did you come from?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.699
Hmm, how do I put this?

18:35.782 --> 18:40.204
When a mommy cat and a daddy cat
love each other very much,

18:40.287 --> 18:42.206
they decide that...

18:42.289 --> 18:45.709
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no.
Where did you come from?</i>

18:45.792 --> 18:48.587
My place!
Where do you think?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.798
No, how did you get here?

18:51.882 --> 18:53.800
I drove!

18:53.884 --> 18:57.804
Look, I've been here two whole minutes,
and no one has offered me a drink.

18:57.888 --> 18:59.306
Harrumph!

18:59.389 --> 19:04.102
- Sorry, Mr. Cat.
Would you like some milk?
- Milk? Ecch! No!

19:04.186 --> 19:07.814
<i>Lactose intolerant.
Gums up the works. Oy.</i>

19:07.898 --> 19:10.108
You'll thank me later.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.280
<i>Wipeout!
- Hello!</i>

19:15.405 --> 19:18.700
<i>@¤@¤Yeah!</i>

19:18.784 --> 19:22.788
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yee-hee-hee!

19:26.083 --> 19:28.502
Nice spread you got here.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.004
Homina-homina-homina-homina!

19:31.088 --> 19:33.090
Who is this?

19:34.883 --> 19:36.802
Ohh!

19:37.886 --> 19:39.805
That's my mom.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.390
Awkward, yeah.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.810
Yes, this place will do
quite nicely, actually. Yeah.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.479
Although those drapes
are a train wreck.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.985
<i>And this is the lumpiest couch
I ever sat on.</i>

19:53.110 --> 19:56.196
Who is this dreadfully
uncomfortable woman?

19:56.280 --> 19:58.699
<i>Get off her.
That's our babysitter.</i>

19:58.782 --> 20:00.701
What the... Babysitter?

20:00.909 --> 20:03.495
You don't need one of those,
do ya?

20:08.584 --> 20:10.794
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

20:10.919 --> 20:13.088
You pay this woman...

20:13.213 --> 20:15.090
to sit on babies?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.217
That's disgusting!

20:18.594 --> 20:21.597
I'd do it for nothing!

20:21.680 --> 20:23.682
Hmm!

20:25.184 --> 20:29.396
Now, let's see
what the old "phunometer"
has to say.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.107
- "Phunometer"?
- Yeah. It measures
how fun you are.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.616
Hi.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.911
Huh?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.415
Ohh.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.587
<i>Ah. Control freak.
Yeah.</i>

20:53.712 --> 20:56.298
Now you.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.593
Hi. How are ya?

20:59.593 --> 21:01.512
- Whoa!

21:08.018 --> 21:09.895
Oh.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.813
Tap it.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.400
Listen, kid,
you can tap it with a hammer,

21:15.484 --> 21:17.402
it ain't gonna change.

21:18.612 --> 21:19.696
Just as I suspected.

21:19.696 --> 21:24.409
You guys are both out of whack.
You're a control freak,
and you're a rule-breaker.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.704
That'll be $700.
Who's your insurance carrier?

21:27.788 --> 21:31.208
- So, what do we do?
- Well, there are two treatments
I'd recommend.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.087
One is a series of painful shots
injected into your abdomen and kneecap.

21:35.212 --> 21:36.880
<i>And the other...</i>

21:37.005 --> 21:39.591
involves a musical number!

21:39.716 --> 21:42.094
<i>@ Me-Me-Me-Meow @</i>

21:42.302 --> 21:43.804
How many shots?

21:44.012 --> 21:47.516
"How many shots?"
Aren't you precious?

21:58.694 --> 22:01.613
<i>Maestro!</i>

22:03.407 --> 22:05.409
@ I know it is wet @

22:05.492 --> 22:08.203
<i>@ And the sun is not sunny @</i>

22:08.912 --> 22:13.208
@ But we can have lots of
good fun that is funny @

22:14.793 --> 22:16.295
@ It's fun to have fun @

22:16.420 --> 22:22.009
@ But you got to know how @

22:26.597 --> 22:28.515
Hair ball.

22:30.392 --> 22:34.605
@ I know lots of good tricks
and I'll... @

22:34.688 --> 22:36.315
<i>Stop this right now!
Huh?</i>

22:36.398 --> 22:38.609
- Who said that?
- Me!

22:38.692 --> 22:40.110
Remember? The fish?

22:40.194 --> 22:43.697
Came home in a Baggie,
loved me for two weeks, and then nothing!

22:43.780 --> 22:46.283
- The fish is talking!
- Well, sure, he can talk.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.495
But is he saying anything?
No, not really. No.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.497
<i>Hey, Socks, can it!</i>

22:51.705 --> 22:53.499
This cat should not be here.
He should not be about.

22:53.582 --> 22:55.417
He should not be here
when your mother is out.

22:55.501 --> 22:59.213
Come on, kids!
You gonna listen to him?
He drinks where he pees!

23:07.888 --> 23:10.599
@There was this cat I knew
back home where I was bred @

23:10.682 --> 23:13.602
@ He never listened to
a single thing his mother said @

23:13.685 --> 23:16.313
<i>@¤He never used the litter box
He made a mess in the hall @¤</i>

23:16.396 --> 23:17.689
@That's why they sent him
to a vet @

23:17.814 --> 23:20.317
@To cut off both his ba... @

23:20.400 --> 23:22.402
ba... ba...

23:22.611 --> 23:25.697
@ Boy, that wasn't
fun, fun, fun @

23:25.906 --> 23:29.618
@ He never learns
You can have fun, fun, fun @
But less is more!

23:29.701 --> 23:32.788
@They may ship you off to school
so rein it in a little @

23:32.913 --> 23:34.915
@ We can't spell "fun"
without "U" in the middle @

23:34.998 --> 23:39.795
<i>Human, this cat is currently in violation
of... 17 of your mother's rules!</i>

23:39.920 --> 23:41.088
City morgue!

23:41.213 --> 23:43.298
- Eighteen!

23:49.513 --> 23:51.515
<i>- Olé!</i>

23:51.598 --> 23:53.308
Ooh!

23:59.606 --> 24:02.484
@ You can juggle work and play
but you have to know the way @

24:02.609 --> 24:05.404
@ You can keep afloat a wish
like the way I do this fish @

24:05.487 --> 24:07.990
<i>@¤ You can be a happy fella
Someone throw me that umbrella @¤</i>

24:08.115 --> 24:10.784
@ And that rake, that cake
Life's what you make it @

24:10.909 --> 24:12.703
@ So have fun, fun, fun @

24:12.786 --> 24:15.581
@ Go insane and have
some fun, fun, fun @

24:15.706 --> 24:18.417
@Just look at me
Fun, fun, fun @

24:18.500 --> 24:21.211
@ No more rain
Look, it's the sun, sun, sun @

24:21.295 --> 24:25.090
@ So can't you see
I'm as happy as a clam
I'm as fit as a fiddle @

24:25.215 --> 24:27.009
@ Yeah, the dogs
may bark about you @

24:27.092 --> 24:28.594
@ And the purebred chaps
may doubt you @

24:28.719 --> 24:30.596
<i>Getting motion sickness!</i>

24:30.721 --> 24:33.390
Milk? Big mistake.

24:33.599 --> 24:36.101
@ But remember this
You can't have fun without "U" @

24:36.185 --> 24:38.103
I can't breathe!
Ohh!

24:38.187 --> 24:40.606
Whoa!

24:40.689 --> 24:44.401
I knew that milk would
come back to haunt me.
Help! Help!

24:53.785 --> 25:00.000
@"U" in the middle @@

25:03.795 --> 25:06.215
- Bravo, Cat.
- Huh?

25:06.298 --> 25:09.384
These children are smart enough
not to fall for your MTV-style flash...

25:09.593 --> 25:11.512
at the expense of content
and moral values.

25:11.595 --> 25:14.306
That was wicked cool!
Do it again!

25:14.389 --> 25:18.018
I'd love to, but Shamu is right...
I really should be going.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.687
- No, don't go!
- No, I should go.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.690
I should let you and the fish
have all your fun conjugating verbs,

25:23.815 --> 25:26.109
cleaning your room,
doing long division.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.695
No, you have to stay!

25:28.820 --> 25:31.281
<i>All right, I'll stay.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!</i>

25:31.406 --> 25:34.284
But if I'm gonna stay,
there's something I wanna show you.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.995
Something magical...

25:37.120 --> 25:39.706
and full of wonder.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.711
- It's called a contract.
- You want us to sign this?

25:44.795 --> 25:47.798
- Just a formality, really. Yeah.
- Who are they?

25:49.508 --> 25:52.719
Magical time-traveling elves.

25:52.803 --> 25:56.181
Yeah. Magic.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.686
Okay, they're my lawyers.

26:00.811 --> 26:03.689
Liability issues, litigious society,
frivolous lawsuits.

26:03.814 --> 26:05.315
You understand.

26:05.315 --> 26:08.485
Basically, this contract guarantees
you can have all the fun you want...

26:08.610 --> 26:10.821
and nothing bed’s
ever gonna happen.

26:11.113 --> 26:13.115
- All the fun we want?
- Uh-yeah!

26:13.198 --> 26:15.409
- Nothing bad will happen?
- Uh-no!

26:15.492 --> 26:19.788
Come on, Sal,
for once in your life
try something spontaneous.

26:22.207 --> 26:26.003
It goes against
my better instincts, but...

26:26.086 --> 26:27.796
fine.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.007
Beautiful.
Initial here.

26:30.090 --> 26:32.301
And here. And here.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.303
Not here!

26:36.096 --> 26:37.598
Turn it over.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.683
This is nothing.

26:39.808 --> 26:42.019
Scratch this.

26:42.186 --> 26:43.604
Smell that!
Terrific.

26:43.687 --> 26:45.689
Yadee-yadee-yadee.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.692
<i>Sign the bottom.</i>

26:48.901 --> 26:50.903
You're it!
Okay, gimme five!

26:53.906 --> 26:56.200
Four.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.495
Let's get this party
started! Uh-huh!

27:00.787 --> 27:03.916
Hey, check out this room!

27:03.999 --> 27:05.918
What now?

27:06.001 --> 27:08.921
Mom says we're not
allowed in the living room
today, or else.

27:09.004 --> 27:12.382
<i>She's worried we'll mess up the couches
by jumpin' on 'em or somethin'</i>

27:12.508 --> 27:15.886
And she's right.
You can't jump on these.

27:16.011 --> 27:19.515
Not like this.
They need some adjustment.
Yee-haw!

27:22.017 --> 27:25.187
Let's take a look
under the hood.

27:25.312 --> 27:28.190
Yeah.

27:28.315 --> 27:30.609
Just doin' my job.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.611
Sorry.
What have we got here?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.780
Whew.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.492
Here we go.

27:38.617 --> 27:42.204
It's oversized.
That's unusual.

27:42.287 --> 27:44.206
Here it is.

27:45.415 --> 27:49.211
Down, Simba!
Down, Simba!
Get outta here!

27:50.420 --> 27:52.714
Spray me, would ya?
You...

28:05.394 --> 28:08.981
<i>- Thanks for the help.</i>

28:10.190 --> 28:13.402
Back in a second.
Who's your couch mechanic?

28:13.485 --> 28:16.113
You oughta call
Mr. Catwrench.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.283
<i>Oww! My fur!
My fur! My fur!</i>

28:24.288 --> 28:27.708
That oughta do it.
Whoo!

28:41.180 --> 28:43.682
Come on, kids.
I could use a little company.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.684
What about Mom's party?

28:45.809 --> 28:47.895
What about it?
We signed the contract.

28:48.020 --> 28:51.315
Wha-hoo!
Yeah!

28:52.399 --> 28:54.318
One cushion left,
Sally.

28:54.401 --> 28:57.321
She'll never do it.
She doesn't know
how to have fun.

28:57.404 --> 29:01.700
<i>Fun? Sally,
you're better than fun.
Fun is beneath you.</i>

29:01.783 --> 29:03.285
Remember
what your mother told you...

29:03.285 --> 29:06.288
<i>No one sets foot
in the living room...</i>

29:06.288 --> 29:08.916
You know what?
Let's just watch some flashbacks.

29:08.999 --> 29:13.921
Absolutely no one sets foot
in the living room, or else.

29:14.004 --> 29:17.299
You're fired... fired... fired...

29:17.382 --> 29:20.219
fired... fired... fired...

29:20.302 --> 29:24.389
Fired... fired... fired... fired...

29:24.515 --> 29:26.683
And that's why...

29:26.808 --> 29:28.185
Oww!

29:29.686 --> 29:32.397
<i>This is where
they buried my brother!</i>

29:32.481 --> 29:33.982
<i>Yeah!</i>

29:34.107 --> 29:36.693
Yippee!
Oh, yeah!

29:36.818 --> 29:40.113
This is amazing!
Like being
in the circus!

29:40.197 --> 29:42.115
Yeah, but without
those tortured animals...

29:42.199 --> 29:44.618
or drunken clowns
that have hepatitis.

29:44.701 --> 29:47.287
See, kids, I told you
we could have fun!

29:47.412 --> 29:50.916
<i>The best thing is,
no one will ever...</i>

29:51.917 --> 29:53.794
know.

29:53.919 --> 29:57.297
Judas Priest!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

29:57.381 --> 30:01.802
Oh, Mr. Quinn,
I was just telling Conrad
to get off the couch.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.804
Bad, Conrad!
Bad!

30:03.887 --> 30:05.806
Sally,

30:05.889 --> 30:07.683
baby, angel, princess,

30:08.600 --> 30:12.604
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, okay?

30:12.688 --> 30:14.898
Nobody likes a suck-up!

30:25.492 --> 30:27.995
Where's the cat?
I don't know.

30:31.915 --> 30:34.918
Ohh!

30:35.085 --> 30:37.004
Good bread.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.799
What are you two
lookin' at?

30:49.516 --> 30:51.393
Is there a cat in here?

30:53.604 --> 30:56.106
I'm gonna...
You're gonna...

30:56.190 --> 30:58.901
I have to...

31:00.194 --> 31:02.196
Get out of here.

31:07.993 --> 31:11.205
See, kids, I told you.
Stick with me, it'll all work out.

31:11.413 --> 31:14.917
Oh, no! Ohh!

31:15.083 --> 31:18.712
Little-known fact...
cats always land on their tushy.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.216
- I thought they always
landed on their feet.
- Oh, sure, now you tell me.

31:22.299 --> 31:23.217
Harrumph!

31:24.510 --> 31:27.679
- So, kiddo, what do you
want to do for fun?
- I wanna make cupcakes!

31:27.804 --> 31:31.099
Cupcakes? Oh, yeah!
To the kitchen!

31:31.183 --> 31:32.809
<i>Live from the kitchen,</i>

31:32.893 --> 31:35.687
<i>the following is
a paid commercial announcement
for Astounding Products.</i>

31:35.687 --> 31:38.106
<i>Hi! Welcome to
Astounding Products.</i>

31:41.401 --> 31:44.279
I'm your host,
the guy in the sweater who asks
all the obvious questions.

31:45.906 --> 31:50.285
Now, here to tell us
about his astounding product
for making cupcakes,

31:50.410 --> 31:53.413
all the way
from Cheshire, England,
please welcome...

31:53.497 --> 31:55.791
Me! Hello!

31:55.916 --> 31:59.586
Now... Hello!
I'm so excited!

31:59.711 --> 32:01.588
Do you love
making cupcakes,

32:01.713 --> 32:04.216
but hate all
the hard cupcake work?

32:04.299 --> 32:06.218
I know I do!

32:06.301 --> 32:09.513
Well, forget
everything you know
about making cupcakes...

32:09.596 --> 32:11.598
and say hello...

32:12.599 --> 32:14.893
to the amazing Kupkake-inator.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.813
<i>- I'm so excited!</i>

32:17.896 --> 32:19.898
Cupcake-a-what?

32:19.982 --> 32:21.900
Kupkake-inator!

32:21.984 --> 32:25.612
Oh, this amazing device
can instantly make cupcakes...

32:25.696 --> 32:28.115
<i>out of anything that
you have in the kitchen.</i>

32:28.198 --> 32:30.993
- Wait a minute.
Did you say “anything"?
- Anything.

32:31.118 --> 32:32.995
Anything?
Yes, anything.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.706
Anything?
Anything.

32:35.789 --> 32:39.209
- Anything?
- I'll get you, and it'll look
like a bloody accident.

32:39.293 --> 32:41.211
<i>- Anything.</i>

32:41.295 --> 32:44.214
Now, take off the lid.
You can put in, I don't know,
a carton of eggs.

32:44.298 --> 32:46.717
What?
How about
a pack of hot dogs?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.719
That's incredible!
Why not some ketchup?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.096
Yeah, why not?
How about...
I know what you're thinkin'.

32:51.305 --> 32:53.682
Even a fire extinguisher.
There we go.

32:53.807 --> 32:55.684
Hmm?

32:55.809 --> 32:58.520
Now, close the lid
and Bob's your flippin' uncle!

32:58.604 --> 33:00.397
What an
astounding product!

33:00.480 --> 33:01.982
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

33:02.107 --> 33:04.902
Open the drawer,

33:04.985 --> 33:08.697
<i>Fill the patented
Kupkake-inator tray,</i>

33:08.780 --> 33:11.617
<i>- Close the drawer,</i>

33:11.700 --> 33:14.912
Then place it
in a conventional oven.

33:19.583 --> 33:22.002
Delicious cupcakes
are just minutes away.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.004
Did you just say
"minutes away"?

33:24.087 --> 33:25.714
That's impossible!

33:25.797 --> 33:29.009
You're not just wrong,
you're stupid.
Now, wait just a minute...

33:29.218 --> 33:31.094
And you're ugly,
just like your mum.

33:31.303 --> 33:33.680
<i>Did you just call
my mother ugly?</i>

33:33.889 --> 33:36.391
Shut up! I mean it!
I will end you!

33:38.519 --> 33:41.104
Um, Cat.
Your tail.

33:41.188 --> 33:43.815
What about it?

33:43.899 --> 33:48.320
Oh, I see! I've chopped it off.
That's interesting, because...

33:49.613 --> 33:52.783
Son of a bi...

33:55.702 --> 33:58.580
Look, I'm not saying
we're going to sue.

33:58.789 --> 34:00.999
I'm just saying
we have a case.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.001
We'll talk later.
Ixnay, ixnay.

34:03.085 --> 34:05.420
Hi.

34:05.504 --> 34:08.090
Cat, is the oven
supposed to be
making that sound?

34:08.215 --> 34:10.092
Huh?

34:10.217 --> 34:13.387
Of course. That means
they're almost done, Conrack.

34:13.512 --> 34:15.597
- Conrad.
- That's what I said, Condor.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.183
<i>- Cat!
- Now, that's my name!</i>

34:25.815 --> 34:28.110
<i>Yep!</i>

34:28.193 --> 34:30.112
They're done!

34:30.320 --> 34:32.697
Oh, man!
There's nothing
to worry about.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.699
I'm sure
they still taste fine.

34:34.783 --> 34:36.702
Yecch!
They're horrible!

34:36.784 --> 34:39.996
Who wants some?
Come on, come on!

34:41.081 --> 34:43.000
Oh... my... cod.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.501
Ohh! Aah!

34:44.585 --> 34:47.504
Cat, you need to
clean this mess up pronto.

34:47.588 --> 34:50.799
We have a contract.
All right, I'll try.

34:52.301 --> 34:55.012
You don't try. You do.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.015
Yes, ma'am.
Right away, ma'am.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.809
I'll be right back.

35:00.893 --> 35:02.686
<i>Whoa!</i>

35:05.898 --> 35:08.192
Hi.
How are ya?

35:08.317 --> 35:10.319
Okay.

35:13.405 --> 35:15.616
Look. I'm a girl.

35:19.286 --> 35:21.413
Stop! That's...

35:21.497 --> 35:23.081
Mom's dress!

35:23.207 --> 35:26.585
This filthy thing?

35:26.710 --> 35:28.795
She was gonna wear that tonight,
and you ruined it.

35:28.921 --> 35:31.882
Honey, it was ruined
when she bought it.

35:33.091 --> 35:35.010
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

35:35.093 --> 35:38.013
<i>I told you
all this would happen!</i>

35:38.096 --> 35:41.099
- But no one listens to a fish!
- Oy.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.810
<i>A dog goes "woof-woof"
and everybody knows that
little Timmy's trapped under a log.</i>

35:43.894 --> 35:45.687
<i>But a fish speaks
in plain English...</i>

35:45.896 --> 35:46.480
All right, everyone,
let's just take a deep breath
and calm down.

35:52.611 --> 35:56.198
<i>You know who's gonna solve it?
Me. I am.</i>

35:56.281 --> 35:59.201
I will personally
take care of everything.

36:00.494 --> 36:02.412
And I know
just the guys to do it.

36:16.093 --> 36:19.680
In this box are two Things.
I will show them to you.

36:19.805 --> 36:24.017
<i>Two Things, and I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.</i>

36:24.101 --> 36:27.479
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun.

36:27.604 --> 36:29.690
So without further ado,

36:29.815 --> 36:33.110
meet Thing Two
and Thing One!

36:35.612 --> 36:37.489
@Ta-da @

36:37.614 --> 36:40.409
Oh, yeah!

36:40.492 --> 36:43.620
Thing One, Conrad, Sally.
Conrad, Sally, Thing One.

36:43.787 --> 36:45.706
<i>Thing Two, Conrad, Sally.
Conrad, Sally, Thing Two.</i>

36:45.914 --> 36:49.001
Thing One, Thing Two.
Thing Two, Thing One.
Conrad, Sally. Sally, Conrad.

36:49.209 --> 36:51.712
I am the Cat.
Don't belittle me.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.797
Ah, yes, of course.

36:53.881 --> 36:56.800
Thing Two would like to
clarify that just because
he wears the number two...

36:56.884 --> 36:59.386
does not imply in any way
that he's inferior to Thing One.

36:59.511 --> 37:00.804
And all of the above.

37:00.888 --> 37:04.516
He says you may feel free
to call him Thing "A," if you like.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.895
He will also accept Super Thing,
Thing King, Kid Dynamite,

37:08.020 --> 37:10.689
Chocolate Thun-Da...
or Ben.
 Ben!

37:13.483 --> 37:16.403
Thing One says
he's Thing One for a reason,

37:16.487 --> 37:18.906
and some people
should just get used to it.

37:18.989 --> 37:21.617
It's a Thing thing.
You wouldn't understand.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.119
Okay, enough!

37:24.203 --> 37:26.413
You are quickly turning into
one of my least favorite Things.

37:28.081 --> 37:31.001
Listen, Convex,
you probably don't
wanna do that.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.003
Why not?
It's just a crate.

37:33.086 --> 37:34.505
This isn't just any old crate.

37:34.588 --> 37:37.716
It's the Trans-dimensional
Transportolator.

37:37.799 --> 37:41.011
It's kinda like a doorway
which leads from this world
to my world.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.388
But it says,
"Made in the Philippines."

37:43.514 --> 37:46.683
<i>Yes, but not this Philippines.</i>

37:46.808 --> 37:51.313
<i>Look, now,
I'm not usually a rules guy,
but this is a biggie.</i>

37:51.396 --> 37:53.398
No opening the crate.

37:53.482 --> 37:56.485
No lookee, no touchee.
Got it?

37:56.693 --> 37:59.696
<i>Mekka-dekka we should
settle our differences.</i>

38:03.617 --> 38:05.494
<i>Things, front and center!</i>

38:05.619 --> 38:07.412
Cool.

38:07.496 --> 38:11.291
All right, Things,
I'm not paying you to
stand around and look pretty.

38:11.416 --> 38:13.418
<i>Here's Mom's dress.</i>

38:13.502 --> 38:15.420
<i>Oh! Mommy's dress!</i>

38:19.716 --> 38:22.511
- What about the couch?
- Which couch?

38:22.594 --> 38:24.596
<i>The clean one,
or the horribly stained one?</i>

38:33.605 --> 38:36.191
Ho!

38:36.316 --> 38:38.193
Mekka-dekka
don't worry!

38:39.611 --> 38:41.780
Incoming!

38:44.116 --> 38:48.787
<i>Cat, they're wrecking
the whole house!</i>

39:09.016 --> 39:12.895
- Conrad, help!
- Help yourself!

39:13.020 --> 39:15.898
Look at me!
Come and get it!

39:21.403 --> 39:25.616
Whoa! Ooh, yeah! Whoa!

39:33.582 --> 39:35.584
That tickles!

39:36.919 --> 39:39.796
Geronimo!

39:42.799 --> 39:46.512
Mine, mine, mine!
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!

39:47.888 --> 39:51.183
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yee-hee-hee! Ho-ho-ho! Whee!

39:59.399 --> 40:01.610
If this were my house,
I'd be furious.

40:08.408 --> 40:11.286
Hey! Klondike!

40:11.411 --> 40:15.082
Do you have any idea
what happened to the lock
on this crate?

40:15.207 --> 40:17.584
- It's on Nevins's collar.
- Nevins?

40:17.709 --> 40:19.419
<i>Nevins? Nevins!</i>

40:19.503 --> 40:23.507
Put the dog down!
I said, put the dog down!

40:23.590 --> 40:25.509
Why won't they
listen to me?

40:25.592 --> 40:31.181
Oh. I don't know if this helps,
but the Things always do
the opposite of what you say.

40:31.306 --> 40:34.810
Why do they always
do the opposite?
That's so annoying!

40:34.893 --> 40:36.812
Remind you of anyone,
Conrad?

40:36.895 --> 40:39.481
<i>Zinga!</i>

40:39.690 --> 40:41.608
Zinga! Zinga!

40:41.817 --> 40:44.695
Blue! 41! Set!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

40:44.820 --> 40:48.615
Hey, Thing,
don't let go of that dog!

40:48.699 --> 40:50.409
Let go!

40:50.492 --> 40:54.121
<i>Catch him...
I mean, don't catch him!</i>

40:57.291 --> 40:58.584
Well, this is just great, Conrad.

40:58.709 --> 41:02.796
The whole house is destroyed,
the party is ruined,
and now Nevins is gone.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.299
Sally, Kojak,

41:05.382 --> 41:09.511
that's nothing compared
to what's gonna happen
if we don't lock this crate.

41:09.720 --> 41:12.598
Take a look.
It's already leaking.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.813
- It won't stay shut.
- Not without the lock.

41:19.897 --> 41:24.818
Look, if we don't get that lock off of Nevins
and put it back on this crate,

41:24.902 --> 41:28.697
we're gonna be staring down
the business end
of the mother of all messes.

41:29.990 --> 41:32.910
We've gotta go out
and find Nevins.

41:32.993 --> 41:35.287
Impossible! Sally!

41:35.412 --> 41:37.789
<i>There's only four hours
till the party.</i>

41:37.915 --> 41:40.417
The Fish is right.
We should call Mom
and tell her what happened.

41:40.501 --> 41:43.712
Look at this house!
There's no way we could
explain this to Mom.

41:43.921 --> 41:46.507
We gotta get Nevins back
and lock the crate!

41:46.715 --> 41:48.592
We're staying and calling Mom.

41:48.717 --> 41:51.011
We're going and getting the dog.

41:51.094 --> 41:53.180
There is a third option.

41:53.305 --> 41:55.599
<i>There is?</i>

41:55.682 --> 41:59.102
<i>Yes. It involves...</i>

41:59.186 --> 42:01.188
murder!

42:01.313 --> 42:04.191
- That's your option?
- No.

42:04.316 --> 42:07.110
But you guys both had options.
I just wanted to have one too.

42:07.194 --> 42:10.489
Or did I?

42:10.614 --> 42:14.409
- Cat, you're not helping!
- Come on. Let's go get that dog.

42:14.493 --> 42:18.997
<i>Now, we just need
a heavy, inanimate object
to weigh down this crate.</i>

42:25.003 --> 42:27.506
There. That oughta
buy us some time.

42:27.589 --> 42:31.593
Come on, kids!
Let's go, go, go!

42:36.098 --> 42:38.892
<i>Identical sister Mitzy...</i>

42:39.017 --> 42:42.104
<i>That's right.</i>

42:46.191 --> 42:48.902
<i>- Yeah!</i>

42:50.696 --> 42:52.614
What do you want now?

42:52.698 --> 42:55.284
Repo.

42:55.409 --> 42:58.620
You're repossessing my TV?

42:58.704 --> 43:00.080
I'm sure I made a payment.

43:00.080 --> 43:03.000
If it's about that bounced check,
let me give you a credit card.

43:03.083 --> 43:07.504
That one's expired.
Huh? Oh, come on!

43:09.715 --> 43:13.886
<i>With the lock on his collar,
Nevins kept running,</i>

43:14.011 --> 43:16.388
<i>unaware of his part...</i>

43:16.513 --> 43:19.016
<i>in the evil Quinn's cunning.</i>

43:19.099 --> 43:22.102
Joan Walden Real Estate.
Be it ever so humble, there's no...

43:22.186 --> 43:23.812
Oh, hi, Joan.

43:23.896 --> 43:26.398
The kids let the dog
out again.
You're kidding.

43:26.607 --> 43:30.319
Don't worry. I'll go get him,
then we'll have a conversation
vis-a-vis military school.

43:30.402 --> 43:33.780
I don't know.
Conrad's like you, Lawrence.

43:33.989 --> 43:36.783
He's very... sensitive.
Uh-huh.

43:36.909 --> 43:39.912
But I suppose it's something
I should consider.

43:39.995 --> 43:43.290
I'll get the dog.
I'll be right over.

43:50.881 --> 43:53.300
<i>Okay, there's Nevins.</i>

43:53.383 --> 43:56.803
<i>Stay out of sight.</i>

44:08.899 --> 44:11.485
I thought the moment
needed something.

44:11.610 --> 44:14.279
Oh, what will become of us?

44:14.404 --> 44:16.490
Your mother will lose her job,

44:16.615 --> 44:19.910
and we'll have to...
live on the street!

44:19.993 --> 44:23.080
I can't! Don't make me go...

44:23.205 --> 44:25.582
<i>I don't know this world!</i>

44:25.707 --> 44:30.504
It's dry! It's like...
I can't... It's too...
Fish!

44:30.587 --> 44:32.506
It's too much!

44:32.589 --> 44:34.591
Would you like to go back
in the toilet?

44:34.716 --> 44:37.219
On second thought,
it's such a beautiful day.
Why spend it indoors?

44:37.302 --> 44:40.013
- Thank you!

44:41.306 --> 44:43.183
Okay, kids.
Get out of my way.

44:43.308 --> 44:47.104
This fence is no match
for my cat-like grace and reflexes.
Here we go.

44:49.982 --> 44:54.194
Ow. Okay.
Watch me fly, kids.

44:59.283 --> 45:01.410
Ow!

45:01.493 --> 45:04.204
I don't think
the little girl's even trying.

45:04.288 --> 45:08.417
What about your
cat-like... reflexes?

45:08.584 --> 45:11.795
What about showing a little effort,
shrimp boat? Now, push!

45:11.920 --> 45:14.214
Whaa!

45:14.298 --> 45:16.508
All right, Nevins.

45:16.592 --> 45:18.594
Time to die.

45:18.719 --> 45:21.805
- Cat, you scared him away!

45:21.889 --> 45:23.891
Dirty hoe.

45:25.601 --> 45:29.479
I'm sorry, baby.
I love you. Hmm.

45:29.605 --> 45:32.316
<i>Come on, Cat!</i>

45:36.111 --> 45:38.197
There he is!

45:40.282 --> 45:42.284
<i>Happy birthday, Denise.</i>

45:42.409 --> 45:44.286
<i>Denise?</i>

45:44.495 --> 45:47.206
Everyone I know
is there.

45:47.289 --> 45:49.791
There's Ginny and Alan.

45:49.917 --> 45:52.794
How come Denise didn't
invite me to her birthday?

45:52.920 --> 45:55.506
<i>Don't worry. Let’s just
get Nevins and go.</i>

45:55.589 --> 45:56.715
<i>Okay, kids.
Everyone outside!</i>

46:03.388 --> 46:05.307
Aaah!

46:05.390 --> 46:08.602
Nevins.
Cat, get down!
They're gonna see you!

46:08.685 --> 46:10.979
<i>Hide!</i>

46:19.404 --> 46:22.282
Piñata! Piñata! Piñata!

46:22.407 --> 46:24.284
Piñata! Piñata!

46:24.409 --> 46:27.496
<i>Piñata! Piñata!</i>

46:27.579 --> 46:30.207
- Everybody join in!

46:35.087 --> 46:37.089
It's breaking!

46:37.214 --> 46:40.217
Step out of my way.

46:42.719 --> 46:44.805
This cannot end well.

46:44.888 --> 46:47.808
- Piñata! Piñata!

46:47.891 --> 46:50.018
<i>@¤I'm easy @¤</i>

46:50.102 --> 46:53.897
<i>@¤Ah, ah, ah, ah @¤</i>

46:53.981 --> 46:56.608
<i>@¤I'm easy
like Sunday morning @¤@¤</i>

47:04.283 --> 47:06.618
Oh-ho-ho! Whoo!

47:06.702 --> 47:09.121
<i>- Oh! Whoo-hoo!
- I got an idea.</i>

47:09.204 --> 47:11.707
<i>Candy!</i>

47:13.292 --> 47:15.294
Candy!

47:18.297 --> 47:21.008
No!

47:21.091 --> 47:24.386
Get back!
Cat!

47:24.511 --> 47:26.513
I'll get you!

47:30.684 --> 47:33.604
I'd love to buy some.

47:33.687 --> 47:35.814
Hello, Mrs. Kwan.
It’s Joan Walden.

47:35.898 --> 47:38.400
I just called
to check on the kids.
Are they okay?

47:38.484 --> 47:41.487
Those aren't children.

47:41.612 --> 47:44.490
They're little angels.

47:46.909 --> 47:49.203
That's sweet.

47:49.286 --> 47:52.206
Well, all right, Mrs. Kwan.
I'll be home as soon as I can.

47:52.289 --> 47:55.209
Bye-bye.
Bye.

48:23.695 --> 48:26.782
<i>All right, soldier.
Our bogey is in range.</i>

48:26.907 --> 48:29.201
Commence
search and destroy.

48:29.284 --> 48:32.120
<i>- What?
- Search and rescue.</i>

48:32.204 --> 48:36.583
I meant search and rescue.
Come on!

48:36.708 --> 48:39.711
I can't believe I wasn't
invited to that party.

48:39.795 --> 48:42.297
Hey!
You're a lone wolf.

48:42.381 --> 48:45.008
Live alone, die alone.
Yeah.

48:45.092 --> 48:48.303
- Can we please get the dog?
Can we please get the dog?

48:48.387 --> 48:51.306
Can we please get the dog?
Boo!

48:54.601 --> 48:57.312
<i>Oh, no! Oh, man!</i>

48:57.396 --> 49:00.315
Hello, Nevins.
Good-bye, Conrad.

49:00.399 --> 49:04.486
Not so tough now,
are you?

49:13.787 --> 49:16.498
We're dead.
We're never gonna get
that crate shut.

49:16.582 --> 49:19.918
<i>And I'm getting shipped off
to Colonel Von Kronk's School
for Wayward Boys!</i>

49:20.002 --> 49:23.589
Why don't we
take my car?
You have a car?

49:23.714 --> 49:26.508
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

49:30.888 --> 49:33.182
Wow.
That is so cool.

49:33.390 --> 49:35.809
That's just
the dust cover.

49:37.811 --> 49:41.982
Here she is, the Super Luxurious
Omnidirectional Whatchamajigger.

49:42.107 --> 49:44.693
Or S.L.O.W. For short.

49:44.818 --> 49:46.820
S.L.O.W.?

49:46.904 --> 49:50.115
Yeah, SLOW.
It's better than the last name we had.

49:50.199 --> 49:53.410
Super Hydraulic
Instantaneous Transporter.

49:53.494 --> 49:57.581
- Oh, you mean...
- Ohh! Quick, to the SLOW.

50:00.417 --> 50:02.294
Buckle up, kids.

50:02.294 --> 50:06.381
We're on a mission to get that dog,
and we will not rest
until we find and destroy it.

50:06.507 --> 50:09.009
Rescue it!
Rescue it! Of course
I meant rescue it.

50:09.218 --> 50:12.513
Whatever. Remember, kids,
there's nothing faster than SLOW.

50:12.596 --> 50:15.682
That's backwards!
It makes no sense.
Look at you! Argh!

50:15.807 --> 50:18.393
Okay, here we go.
G.P. S... check.

50:18.519 --> 50:20.395
<i>DVD, CD... check.</i>

50:20.521 --> 50:23.482
Someone from Czechoslovakia
is a... Czech.

50:23.607 --> 50:25.984
Siren!
What are you...
What...

50:26.109 --> 50:28.403
<i>Siren?</i>

50:28.487 --> 50:32.282
Let's go!

50:32.491 --> 50:34.701
Whoo-whoa-ho-ho!

50:34.910 --> 50:38.205
Hi there!
How are you? Yeah!

50:45.212 --> 50:50.884
@ I'm sending Conrad away @

50:51.009 --> 50:53.512
- Oh! Oh!

50:53.595 --> 50:56.306
<i>Oh!</i>

50:56.390 --> 50:59.685
I can't believe you whizzed
on my taco!

51:02.396 --> 51:05.399
Wait till Joan
gets a load of you!

51:08.110 --> 51:11.280
<i>- There they are!
- Red light, red light,
red light, red light!</i>

51:11.405 --> 51:13.407
Red light!

51:18.120 --> 51:21.081
- Someone else should drive.
- All right. You win.

51:21.206 --> 51:23.709
Concrete,
you drive.
Are you serious?

51:23.792 --> 51:25.294
I don't know.

51:25.294 --> 51:29.006
A little voice inside of me
is saying, "This is a bad idea,"

51:29.006 --> 51:31.008
but I can barely hear
that little voice...

51:31.091 --> 51:36.305
because an even louder
little voice is screaming,
"Let the 12-year-old drive!"

51:36.388 --> 51:38.182
Now, punch it!

51:40.601 --> 51:42.519
<i>This is awesome!</i>

51:48.901 --> 51:51.904
- I want to drive.
- I think that's a great idea.

51:54.907 --> 51:57.910
Wait!
Two people can't drive
at the same time.

51:57.993 --> 52:01.997
You're right.
We should all drive.

52:05.501 --> 52:09.880
<i>- Cat! Where are the brakes?
- I'll get them.</i>

52:12.216 --> 52:16.512
I think there's something wrong
with your brakes. When's the
last time you had them checked?

52:16.595 --> 52:19.681
<i>Bad brake!</i>

52:26.980 --> 52:30.317
<i>One-way street, one-way street,
one-way street, one-way street!</i>

52:35.906 --> 52:39.284
Hey, Rhode Island license plate.
You never see those.

52:44.498 --> 52:47.000
Om. Om.

52:53.715 --> 52:57.094
Air bag. Standard.

52:59.513 --> 53:02.307
I think... I wet... my jar.

53:02.391 --> 53:04.393
Can we do that again?

53:11.692 --> 53:13.193
Hey, there he is!

53:16.280 --> 53:18.991
<i>Oh, no!
He's going into Mom's office!</i>

53:19.116 --> 53:21.410
Come on, Cat!

53:23.203 --> 53:24.788
You know, Nevins,

53:24.913 --> 53:28.500
when Joan finds out
you've escaped again,
Conrad will be moving out,

53:28.584 --> 53:30.586
and I'll be moving in.

53:33.088 --> 53:36.008
<i> We've gotta get
Nevins and that lock back.
What are we gonna do?</i>

53:36.091 --> 53:39.303
<i>Don't worry.
I have three plans.</i>

53:39.386 --> 53:42.389
Plan "A": "Mess up
a perfectly clean house."

53:42.514 --> 53:47.019
Done that. Plan "B":
"Cut your losses and ditch the kids."

53:47.102 --> 53:49.688
- That could work.
- What about that one?

53:49.813 --> 53:54.818
Plan "C": "Trick Mom's boyfriend
into handing over dog and lock."

53:54.902 --> 53:57.905
I don't know.
I still like Plan "B."

53:57.988 --> 54:00.699
- Cat!
- Okay, okay. Plan "C."

54:00.908 --> 54:02.618
Look at you. Argh!

54:04.912 --> 54:07.498
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

54:07.581 --> 54:10.918
I'd like you to sign
my petition. Yeah.

54:11.001 --> 54:13.295
Get out of my way,
you hippie freak.

54:13.420 --> 54:16.089
Are you aware of the senseless,
wholesale slaughter...

54:16.215 --> 54:19.593
of the flatulating,
acid-spitting Zumzizeroo?

54:19.718 --> 54:22.221
What will it take
to get you out of my face?

54:22.304 --> 54:24.515
Just sign my petition...

54:24.681 --> 54:28.018
with this large, oversized pen
that requires two hands.

54:28.101 --> 54:30.687
<i>I see.</i>

54:30.813 --> 54:33.315
- Will you hold my dog?
- Yes!

54:33.482 --> 54:36.902
Okay, I have a problem
with the word "dog."

54:36.985 --> 54:40.280
I don't use the "D" word per se
'cause I think it's really, really wrong.

54:41.490 --> 54:44.993
<i>Yeah. But I will happily
hold your Canine-American.</i>

54:45.118 --> 54:48.580
- I'm more comfortable
with that really, yeah.

54:48.705 --> 54:52.793
@ How much is that Canine-American
in the window @

54:52.918 --> 54:55.420
Cat! Come on!

54:57.214 --> 54:59.716
<i>- Hey, what the...</i>

54:59.800 --> 55:02.803
<i>Go, go, go!
Come back here!
I'm on to you kids!</i>

55:03.011 --> 55:05.806
- Nothing to see here.
Keep moving! Go!

55:05.889 --> 55:09.017
Come on! Let's go.
Ah, get in, get in!

55:09.101 --> 55:13.188
Come on, let's go.
Get in! Hi, hi.
Get in! Get in!

55:13.397 --> 55:16.483
<i>Look out below!</i>

55:16.608 --> 55:19.820
Oh! Sorry. Over there.

55:21.488 --> 55:24.491
<i>
Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!</i>

55:24.616 --> 55:27.619
<i>Ohh!</i>

55:29.913 --> 55:32.583
Oh!

55:32.708 --> 55:34.293
I got you!

55:36.503 --> 55:39.506
Here he comes!
Cat!

55:42.092 --> 55:47.181
- Where's my hat? Oh! Go! Go, go!

55:47.306 --> 55:49.308
Go! Let's go!
My tail, my tail.

55:49.391 --> 55:53.312
Come on, Cat!
I'm walking here!

56:00.110 --> 56:03.405
Joan. Joan!

56:05.782 --> 56:08.702
- I think we lost him.
- Not the pocket. Not the pocket!

56:08.785 --> 56:12.706
- We got the lock back.
Now let's get home.
- Relax, kid. I'm all over it.

56:12.915 --> 56:15.501
Hey.

56:15.584 --> 56:17.711
What's wrong?
This.

56:17.794 --> 56:20.881
This is not my hat.
I must have picked up
the wrong hat back there.

56:21.006 --> 56:23.509
- So?
- So...

56:23.592 --> 56:27.304
without my hat,
I'm just your garden-variety
six-foot-tall talking cat.

56:27.596 --> 56:28.680
<i>Joan, your children
are running around town
like complete maniacs.</i>

56:30.891 --> 56:35.521
<i>Yes, they are.
With some weird,
hairy man in a big hat.</i>

56:35.604 --> 56:37.481
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

56:37.606 --> 56:40.818
You're gonna believe everything
I'm telling you once we get to
your house, okay? Come on.

56:40.901 --> 56:42.820
We're doomed!

56:42.903 --> 56:47.199
We're dead. This is all my fault.
I'm such an idiot.

56:47.282 --> 56:51.495
Why do I always have to do
the opposite of what I'm supposed to?

56:51.620 --> 56:53.497
Wait a second.
That's it! The opposite!

56:53.705 --> 56:57.209
Hey, Things!
Don't help us!

56:57.292 --> 57:00.879
Do not show up and help us
get home right now!

57:01.004 --> 57:04.299
- We're goin' on a road trip!
- Larry's car?

57:05.592 --> 57:08.887
How'd you get so smart?

57:09.012 --> 57:12.391
<i>
So the race was on
to get back home first.</i>

57:12.516 --> 57:15.394
Hang on! We gotta beat
Mom and Quinn home!

57:15.519 --> 57:19.314
<i>But back at their home,
things were just getting worse.</i>

57:35.706 --> 57:37.499
There's Mom and Larry!

57:37.583 --> 57:40.711
Step on it, Joan.
Go, go, go, go, go.

57:40.794 --> 57:45.215
Oh, Things, do not do anything
to slow down my mom.

57:45.382 --> 57:47.217
<i>Slow down Mom!</i>

57:54.183 --> 57:57.186
Look, Joan, they don't
beat them every day.

57:57.311 --> 57:59.605
<i>Oh, great.</i>

58:04.693 --> 58:07.488
I'm sorry, Officer.
Was I speeding?

58:07.613 --> 58:10.991
Mekka dekka license,
appa registration.

58:12.618 --> 58:15.204
Mekka dekka,
you're one hot mama.

58:15.287 --> 58:17.915
Hey, that's my car.
Joan, we better go right away!

58:18.081 --> 58:20.292
Please let me handle this.

58:20.501 --> 58:22.920
Sorry, I guess I was
in a hurry to get home.

58:23.003 --> 58:26.715
- I'm not gonna let them
get away with this!

58:32.095 --> 58:33.514
Meet me at the house!

58:45.609 --> 58:48.612
Not so fast,
you little maggots!
Ha-ha!

58:48.695 --> 58:52.199
<i>Oh, you are so busted.
Now get inside.</i>

58:52.282 --> 58:54.284
You don't want to go in there.
It's going to be a total...
Aah!

58:56.495 --> 58:59.414
What?
Sally, what happened?

58:59.498 --> 59:01.917
<i>What about the mother
of all messes?
I don't know.</i>

59:02.084 --> 59:04.711
Why am I sneezing?

59:10.509 --> 59:13.220
That'd be me. Boo!

59:13.303 --> 59:16.682
You're a giant...

59:16.807 --> 59:18.684
Cat!

59:22.104 --> 59:25.607
Judas Priest!

59:25.816 --> 59:27.818
<i>Ooh.
Mama mia.</i>

59:31.905 --> 59:34.283
What happened
to our house?

59:34.408 --> 59:37.494
It's the mother
of all messes.
Yup!

59:37.619 --> 59:41.081
Pure, unadulterated fun
without any good sense or judgment.

59:41.206 --> 59:43.709
See, Corn Dog,
this is why I warned you...

59:43.792 --> 59:45.711
not to open the crate.

59:45.794 --> 59:48.505
- Although, on the plus side,

59:48.589 --> 59:53.302
I think people will be
talking about tonight's party
for the rest of their lives.

59:55.596 --> 59:58.807
- We gotta shut the crate! Come on!
- Okay.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.396
Let's take the front hall carpet.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.400
- This can't be the front hall.
- This is what happens when you
mix your world and my world.

01:00:08.609 --> 01:00:10.903
Oh, and when you eat
bad shellfish.

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:13.614
Let's go! Oh, yeah!

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:16.492
Cat, how do we
find the crate?
Beats me.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.703
This hat is worthless,
and it makes me look fat.

01:00:19.786 --> 01:00:21.914
- Where's Mrs. Kwan?
- Oh-ho-ho!

01:00:21.997 --> 01:00:25.417
<i>Here she comes,
right on schedule.</i>

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:31.381
- Oh, yeah!
- We're going to ride Mrs. Kwan?

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:35.219
<i>Sure! It's the only way
to the crate. Hop on!</i>

01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:39.014
Oh, this is gonna be good!

01:00:39.097 --> 01:00:43.018
Please keep your hands and feet
in the Kwan at all times!

01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:47.189
Enjoy the ride!

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:50.984
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the dining room. Ohh!</i>

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:53.403
<i>This is the dining room?</i>

01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:55.697
Hey, look.
Chandelier!

01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:05.207
<i>Is that the bathroom?</i>

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:07.918
You might want to
hold it for a while.

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:12.005
Something like that
really burns my...

01:01:12.089 --> 01:01:14.216
Aaah!

01:01:16.093 --> 01:01:21.098
This is amazing!
It's like a ride
at an amusement park!

01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:24.101
You mean, like at...
Universal Studios.

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:26.812
Cha-ching.

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:30.607
Whoa!

01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:36.488
- Whoa!

01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:40.701
Please exit the Kwan to your left.
Have a nice day!

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:43.495
This is ridiculous.
I have to get home.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.000
Police brutality!
Illegal choke hold!

01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:51.712
Where are we?
The living room,
I think.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.089
Ah, man!
My eyes are closed.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:58.719
If there's no line, could we
go back and do that again?
There's the crate!

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.596
Oh!

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:07.811
If we shut the crate,
the house will go back to normal.

01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:09.980
You have the lock?

01:02:10.105 --> 01:02:12.399
Got it!
Come on! Let's go!

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.780
Sally!

01:02:18.906 --> 01:02:22.201
- Come on!
- It won't shut!

01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:26.788
Sally! Everything
is disappearing up there!

01:02:26.997 --> 01:02:29.208
- Help!
- Sally!

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:32.002
- Oh! Oh!
- Sal... Aaah!

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:34.796
- Help me, Conrad!
- Sally!

01:02:36.381 --> 01:02:40.886
Help me!
I can't hold on!

01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:44.515
Hang on!
Help me, Conrad!

01:02:44.598 --> 01:02:47.684
<i>Help!
Sally, I can't reach
the lock!</i>

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:51.980
- No!
- I can't save you
unless you let go!

01:02:52.105 --> 01:02:53.899
Okay.

01:02:54.983 --> 01:02:58.403
Help me!

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.283
- Yes!

01:03:31.603 --> 01:03:35.899
<i>Ugh!</i>

01:03:35.983 --> 01:03:38.318
I did it!
I did it!

01:03:38.402 --> 01:03:41.113
<i>I did it! I did it!
I did it!</i>

01:03:41.196 --> 01:03:43.282
I did it! I did it!

01:03:46.493 --> 01:03:50.289
Okay, "we" did it.

01:03:50.414 --> 01:03:53.208
I don't think
we did anything.

01:03:53.417 --> 01:03:57.588
The place is still a wreck.
You said if we shut the crate,
everything would be okay!

01:03:57.713 --> 01:04:00.716
But it's not.
It's a complete disaster!

01:04:00.799 --> 01:04:03.302
Well, what are you
gonna do?

01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:05.304
Tennis, anyone?

01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:15.189
Ooh!

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:18.108
Love that new ball smell.
Yeah.

01:04:18.192 --> 01:04:23.405
- Hey, your hat... it's magic again?
- Oops.

01:04:23.489 --> 01:04:27.618
Well, now that the cat's out of the bag,
to use an archaic
and cruel-sounding metaphor,

01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.703
why don't you serve first?

01:04:29.786 --> 01:04:31.997
You had your real hat
this whole time?

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.292
Uh-yup.
I planned the whole day.

01:04:35.501 --> 01:04:38.921
- What do you mean,
you planned the whole day? All of it?
- Uh-yup.

01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:40.380
- The house getting trashed?
- Uh-yup.

01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:42.216
- Quinn taking Nevins?
- Uh-yup.

01:04:42.299 --> 01:04:45.385
- Cutting off your tail?
- Uh-nope. No.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.805
<i>You even knew
I'd open the crate?</i>

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:52.810
Why do you think I made it my one rule?
I knew you couldn't resist.

01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:56.396
Now, who's up for a game
of Canadian doubles?

01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:01.193
Cat, you said nothing bad
would happen.

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:04.279
Cat, you need to get out.

01:05:04.488 --> 01:05:06.907
I don't know that game.
It's not a game.

01:05:07.115 --> 01:05:10.202
None of this is a game!

01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:14.706
- But I thought you two
wanted to have fun today.
- Look around, Cat.

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:17.501
<i>You were right.
It's fun to have fun,
but you have to know how.</i>

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:21.296
You don't know
when enough is enough.
Now, go!

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:24.383
Suzy.

01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:26.218
Cromwell.

01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:28.220
Please.

01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:30.389
Out!

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.106
Out!

01:05:54.705 --> 01:05:56.790
Good riddance!

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:59.710
Now, this may not be the time
for “I told you so," but...

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.385
Like I said,
not the time.

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:10.804
I'll get the mop
and bucket.

01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:14.892
Conrad, you might want
to get out of here until Mom
has a chance to calm down.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.897
No. This was my fault.
I'll take the blame.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.400
Look, Mom will be home any second.
Why don't you go upstairs?

01:06:23.484 --> 01:06:25.986
I'm not going upstairs.
I'm staying with you.

01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:29.406
Really? Why?
Two reasons.

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.700
One, the stairs are destroyed.

01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:36.580
Two, this is just as much
my fault as yours.

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:38.582
We should share the blame.

01:06:39.917 --> 01:06:41.793
Thanks, Sally.

01:06:41.919 --> 01:06:43.795
By the way,

01:06:43.921 --> 01:06:46.298
you're a pretty good brother.

01:06:46.381 --> 01:06:50.385
Glad you think that.
Maybe we can room together
at military school.

01:06:54.181 --> 01:06:57.100
Well, here goes.

01:07:05.818 --> 01:07:08.821
@ Bet you thought I'd gone
Bet you felt a sting @

01:07:08.821 --> 01:07:11.907
<i>@¤Bet you never thought
I'd have another song to sing @¤</i>

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:14.701
@ But now that you've learned your lesson
Allow me to blow your mind @

01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:17.913
@ By reading to you the small print
of the contract that you signed @@

01:07:17.996 --> 01:07:21.500
Okay, section eight,
article 93, subparagraph 834.

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.502
<i>Right by the chili stain.</i>

01:07:23.585 --> 01:07:27.005
It reads, "If Conrad, a.k.a. Concrete,
should open the crate...

01:07:27.089 --> 01:07:30.300
"and we know he will...
the contract shall be null and void.

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:33.720
"However,

01:07:33.804 --> 01:07:37.683
if Sally and Conrad
should learn from their mistakes,
the contract shall be reinstated."

01:07:37.808 --> 01:07:40.811
<i>I think you two have satisfied
the legal burden of learning.</i>

01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:42.688
Yeah!

01:07:42.813 --> 01:07:45.315
So there's just one last game to play.
It's called "Clean Up The House."

01:07:45.399 --> 01:07:49.820
Kids, meet the Dynamic Industrial
Renovating Tractormajigger.

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:51.697
D-l-R-T?

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.615
That's right!

01:07:56.493 --> 01:08:00.289

<i>@¤Getting so much better

01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:05.289
Okay, we had some good times.

01:10:05.414 --> 01:10:07.291
We cleaned up the house.

01:10:07.499 --> 01:10:10.002
We even managed to work in
an up-tempo pop tune for the sound track.

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:12.087
That's important.

01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:16.592
I guess there's just one
last thing to check.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.095
Huh?

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:31.482
Looks like everything's
in balance,

01:10:31.607 --> 01:10:33.484
but you're still smoking
way too many cigars.

01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:37.488
<i>- And you... lay off the sauce!</i>

01:10:37.613 --> 01:10:39.615
Cat,

01:10:39.698 --> 01:10:44.119
this day has been...
amazing.

01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:46.079
Thank you, Cat.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.503
For everything.

01:10:54.087 --> 01:10:56.006
Conrad?

01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:59.009
Sally?

01:11:01.595 --> 01:11:03.514
Adieu.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.392
<i>Cat!
- Cat!</i>

01:11:07.518 --> 01:11:09.895
- Huh?
- Wait, Cat.
- Don't go!

01:11:11.814 --> 01:11:13.899
Uh-oh!

01:11:17.194 --> 01:11:20.113
<i>All right, kids.
This place better not be a mess.</i>

01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:22.699
I'm... home?

01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:25.118
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Mom.

01:11:25.202 --> 01:11:29.206
Miss Walden, home so soon?
The children were angels.

01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:31.583
<i>- Thanks, Mrs. Kwan.
- Hello, Joan.</i>

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:34.920
Lawrence, what happened to you?

01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:40.008
They... happened to me.

01:11:40.092 --> 01:11:43.512
Your demonic children.

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:46.598
<i>They destroyed your house!</i>

01:11:46.807 --> 01:11:49.518
Uh...

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:52.980
<i>The house was alive.
The wall was made of paper.</i>

01:11:53.105 --> 01:11:56.984
I fell off the cliff.
And the giant cat...

01:11:59.111 --> 01:12:01.113
The giant cat!

01:12:01.196 --> 01:12:03.115
Tell her.

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:06.118
Larry, Larry.

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:08.495
You look terrible,

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.581
and my mom
thinks you're insane.

01:12:10.706 --> 01:12:15.419
This is what we in sales
call "a win-win scenario."

01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:19.882
Joan, you are passing up
the opportunity of a lifetime.

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:23.802
You know what kind of kid
your boy is.

01:12:23.886 --> 01:12:27.306
I mean, who are you
going to believe?

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:31.310
You're right. I do know
what kind of kid Conrad is.

01:12:31.393 --> 01:12:33.312
He can be irresponsible.

01:12:33.395 --> 01:12:35.814
Yes!
He makes bad choices.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:39.485
Sometimes he makes me
want to tear my hair out.
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:43.197
But he's a good kid,
and I believe in him.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.616
Now, I'd like you
to leave.

01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:48.911
Wha... Joan. Joan.

01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:52.289
Joan. Joan.

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:57.419
Oh, Joan, Joan, Joan!

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:08.806
- Will you marry me, Joan?

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:11.892
Oh, Joan, Joan,
Joan, Joan.

01:13:15.103 --> 01:13:18.398
Yes!
Yeah!

01:13:18.482 --> 01:13:20.484
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:25.405
Oh, that's nice.

01:13:28.992 --> 01:13:31.787
Mr. Humberfloob?
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:35.916
Almost got me again.
Enjoy the party.

01:13:35.999 --> 01:13:40.212
<i>Mr. Humberfloob.
Joan, the party's a hit
and the house is immaculate.</i>

01:13:40.295 --> 01:13:42.381
Congratulations.

01:13:42.506 --> 01:13:44.800
<i>Miss Walden. Uh, Miss Walden.</i>

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:48.011
Chicka-ow, chicka-ow,
chica-yee-haw!
Hi, Mom!

01:13:48.095 --> 01:13:51.306
<i>Honey, your cupcakes
are a huge hit.
What did you put in them?</i>

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:54.685
Mom, you can make cupcakes
out of anything.

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:58.188
<i>Are you telling me
you can make cupcakes
out of anything?</i>

01:13:58.313 --> 01:14:01.900
- Anything.
- Anything?

01:14:01.984 --> 01:14:04.403
So what did you kids
do today, huh?

01:14:04.486 --> 01:14:07.990
<i>Well, what would you do
if your mother asked you?</i>

01:14:08.115 --> 01:14:11.410
<i>The family was whole,
all thanks to the Cat,</i>

01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:14.496
<i>who was dashing and charming,
no doubt about that.</i>

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.498
<i>He was witty and cultured...</i>

01:14:16.582 --> 01:14:18.584
<i>and, well, very endearing...</i>

01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:20.794
<i>and tremendously attractive,</i>

01:14:20.919 --> 01:14:23.088
but in a sort of real way.

01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:26.383
You know, kind of
an approachable way that I think
you don't see these days...

01:14:26.508 --> 01:14:29.386
Oh! Hello! I was just, uh...

01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:33.015
I really should be going.

01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:35.392
How'd they get so smart?

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.108
Oh, yeah!

01:14:44.193 --> 01:14:45.903
Whoo!

01:14:57.414 --> 01:14:59.291
Come on, Things!
Let's go!

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:02.794
What's on my schedule
for tomorrow?

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.881
What do you say
we go on vacation?

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:09.801
How 'bout Hawaii?
I like Hawaii.

01:15:09.885 --> 01:15:13.680
I should warn you,
there are certain places that
don't allow certain Things.

01:15:13.806 --> 01:15:18.685
<i>Oh, Things are complicated.</i>
