00:08.280 --> 00:10.880
Our government has asked us
to return to Tollana...

00:11.040 --> 00:14.000
..to arrange formal diplomatic
relations with your people.

00:14.160 --> 00:19.160
Consider it done. You are, after all, the
people who saved us from the Goa'uld.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.400
Thank you. Yes. Well, in that spirit,
we'd like to arrange for a trade.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.240
- What would you like to trade?
- Technology.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.000
I'm sorry. You know that is
the one thing we cannot give you.

00:32.159 --> 00:34.280
Tollan law strictly forbids it.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.280
OK, we understand that. However,
in our culture, laws can be changed...

00:38.440 --> 00:41.480
..when the reasons for those laws
are no longer relevant.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.800
The reasons for these laws
are still relevant.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.680
OK. Please. If, uh... If you'd
just allow me to make our case.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.840
- I assume you want weapons technology.
- Yes.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.400
One of those ion cannons would be nice.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.800
I see.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.200
And for what will you use such a cannon?

01:02.280 --> 01:04.560
To defend ourselves against the Goa'uld.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.680
Forgive me, Colonel, but our research
shows that you are far more likely...

01:08.840 --> 01:13.960
..to use our "technology"
against enemies on your own planet.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.160
What if I gave you my word
that would never happen?

01:17.320 --> 01:20.000
Are you the commander
of your entire nation?

01:23.800 --> 01:27.640
- No.
- Then, in truth, you cannot guarantee it.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.960
- You know what? Forget it.
- Jack...

01:33.360 --> 01:36.920
We knew you wouldn't give us anything.
We're wasting time here.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.120
- Jack...
- No, Daniel. Let's go!

01:48.240 --> 01:50.240
(Daniel) Uh, wh-what are you doin'?

01:50.400 --> 01:54.520
We never should have saved
their technologically superior butts!

01:58.600 --> 02:02.600
- That's what disabled our weapons.
- As well as the Goa'uld technology.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.880
- Don't even think about it.
- Isn't this against regulations?

02:06.040 --> 02:08.360
I suppose it is, Carter.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.160
Let's go.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.160
- Kind of crossed the line there...
- Shut up, Daniel!

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.640 --> 03:33.200
As you were. Sorry to keep you waiting.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.920
So, what is this device
you've brought back?

03:37.080 --> 03:40.520
It's what the Tollan used to disable
our weapons when we were there.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
- And it really works?
- Worked on us. And the Goa'ulds.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.800
- That should come in handy. Good job.
- Thank you, sir.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.200
So, what did you have to
promise them in return, Dr Jackson?

03:54.080 --> 03:58.440
Actually, General, we didn't have to
promise to give them anything.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.320
They just gave you the device as a reward
for saving them from the Goa'uld?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.360
Actually, the Tollan refused
to give us any technology.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.800
Offered us a nice fruit basket, though.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.720
Well, I'm confused.
How did you get the device?

04:19.240 --> 04:21.160
Major Carter?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.800
- Uh...
- I took it, sir.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.880
- Took it?
- Yes.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.400
You stole it?!

04:30.560 --> 04:33.800
I like to think of it as "borrowed", sir.

04:34.800 --> 04:39.600
- Major Carter'll copy it and we'll return it.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing!

04:39.760 --> 04:44.640
You and your team stole an alien device
from an extremely advanced alien culture.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.600
They won't retaliate,
if that's what you're worried about.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.600
Not their way. Right, Daniel?

04:51.760 --> 04:54.320
This command
has already been accused...

04:54.440 --> 04:57.440
..of stealing from several
other alien cultures, Colonel.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.800
Until now, we've denied it.
Perhaps that was a bit premature.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.920
Dare I ask how many
other items you've stolen?

05:06.920 --> 05:09.320
None. This is the first.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.480
Colonel, you don't seem
to understand how serious this is.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.760
You and your team have committed
a court-martiallable offence.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.000
To be fair, General,...

05:20.880 --> 05:22.800
..l did it.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.640
Carter and Daniel protested.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.880
And Teal'c...

05:29.000 --> 05:32.360
He said nothing, but I could tell
he was opposed to my actions...

05:32.520 --> 05:35.400
..by the way he cocked his head
and raised his eyebrow.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.880
Enough, Colonel!

05:38.040 --> 05:40.960
Dr Jackson, Major Carter and Teal'c,...

05:41.280 --> 05:44.600
..you will return this device
immediately to the Tollan...

05:44.760 --> 05:49.680
..and, hopefully, smooth over
what must be some very ruffled feathers.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.440
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

05:55.680 --> 05:58.840
Our core mission is
to find technologies we can use...

05:59.000 --> 06:01.200
..to repel Goa'uld incursion. Am I right?

06:01.360 --> 06:04.560
You are bordering on insubordination.
We do not rob friendlies.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.320
- With no due respect, that's plain stupid!
- Colonel...

06:08.480 --> 06:11.880
Since the Pentagon won't approve
our programme, we have no choice...

06:12.040 --> 06:15.560
- Colonel, do not go there!
- ..but to take steps to get what we need!

06:15.720 --> 06:18.880
As long as I am in command of the SGC,...

06:19.040 --> 06:21.880
..we will hold ourself
to the highest ethical standards.

06:22.040 --> 06:25.680
And when the Goa'uld wipe us out
because we cannot defend ourselves,...

06:25.840 --> 06:29.240
..l'm sure we'll all feel great
about our high moral standards.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.920
Colonel O'Neill, you are out of line.
Now, stand down!

06:44.560 --> 06:48.280
Colonel O'Neill, I am hereby
relieving you of your command.

06:48.440 --> 06:52.920
You are to report to the infirmary
and stay there until I send for you.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.840
No holding cell, sir?

06:55.560 --> 06:58.680
That could very well be your next stop,
if you say another word.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.560
- (technician) lncoming traveller.
- Now, go to the infirmary...

07:02.720 --> 07:05.400
..and submit yourself
for a complete examination.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.680
Teal'c, escort him.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.280
And, Teal'c,...

07:22.440 --> 07:26.960
..you are no longer under Colonel
O'Neill's command. Is that understood?

07:27.680 --> 07:29.400
Understood.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.040
(technician) Unauthorised
incoming traveller. Closing the iris.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.920
Great(!) Now what?

07:56.840 --> 07:58.960
Hold your fire!

08:04.720 --> 08:07.560
Your Eminence, welcome to Earth.

08:07.720 --> 08:12.040
High Chancellor Travell, this is General
Hammond, commander of this facility.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.920
It's an honour to meet you.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.160
I only wish it were under
more pleasant circumstances.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.240
We have come to retrieve
our stolen property...

08:21.400 --> 08:26.560
..and to tell you all diplomatic relations
with your people will be terminated.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.040
Of course, we will return
your property to you immediately.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.919
But, please, if you will just sit down
with us and at least talk about it.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.320
Then you admit you have stolen from us.

08:36.480 --> 08:40.280
Your Eminence, you're wise enough
not to hold the actions of one man...

08:40.440 --> 08:43.480
- ..against an entire planet.
- You were there, Dr Jackson.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.080
As were you, Major. And Teal'c.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.120
Who exactly are you saying
is responsible?

08:51.440 --> 08:54.920
Thanks, Doc. As always, a pleasure.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.200
I don't see anything wrong with you.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.640
Your blood pressure,
DRE and EEGL seem normal.

09:00.800 --> 09:04.080
It'll be a while before I get your
hormone levels and CAT scans back.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.560
Great. Let me know what kind of
wacky alien stuff you find in there.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.880
Excuse me.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.680
I am to keep you here until
General Hammond is ready for you.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.120
Get out of my way, Teal'c.
That's an order.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.600
(phone rings)

09:20.760 --> 09:24.040
- I do not understand your behaviour.
- Get out of my way!

09:25.160 --> 09:27.080
(Dr Fraiser) Fraiser.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.840
Yes, sir.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.360
Colonel, General Hammond
wants to see you in his office.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.800
Carter.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.720
Sir?

09:56.800 --> 09:58.120
What?

09:58.280 --> 10:00.880
- Is there anything I can do?
- About?

10:02.040 --> 10:05.520
Well, sir, with respect,
you aren't exactly acting like yourself.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.560
No, Carter.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.160
I haven't been acting like myself
since I met you.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.240
Now I'm acting like myself.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.800
Well, look who's here.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.200
Come to retrieve
your vastly superior stuff?

10:28.720 --> 10:31.760
It'd be a lot more superior
if it wasn't so easy to steal.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.800
(Hammond) Colonel O'Neill!

10:33.960 --> 10:37.280
Get in here and take a seat!
Close the door!

10:41.520 --> 10:44.400
My God, Jack,
you've really crossed the line here.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.920
In terms of my insubordination to you,
you're absolutely right, General.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.080
And for that I'm truly sorry.
But I still think what I did was right.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.040
I just met with two members of
the Tollan High Council who disagree.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.000
The Tollan are dictating our policies now?

11:01.160 --> 11:05.360
The victims of a crime are demanding the
perpetrator be dealt with appropriately.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.680
- I'm a criminal?
- What you've done is court-martiallable.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.280
I have to press charges.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.240
Well, by all means, General,
do what you have to do.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.920
I do have one other option
I can offer you, Jack.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.240
- What's that?
- Early retirement.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.440
Now, see, I tried that once before
and you pulled me out of it.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.840
The offer is only on the table
while you're in this room.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.920
All this for one little indiscretion?

11:38.600 --> 11:43.280
Five counts of direct insubordination
to superior officers and a US senator.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.800
Two counts of refusal to obey orders.
Kidnapping an alien child.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.440
- Should I go on?
- The proverbial straw, sir?

11:51.880 --> 11:55.640
You got it. I'd accept the offer,
if I were you, Jack.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.320
Beats the hell out of the prison time
you'd get otherwise.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.360
Then I guess I'm retiring.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.160
(doorbell)

12:41.400 --> 12:42.920
Hi.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.760
- What do you want?
- I'm not sure, to tell you the truth.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.360
- I'm here to talk, I guess.
- So talk.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.640
- You got another one of those?
- Yeah.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.280
Feel like sharing?

13:06.120 --> 13:08.440
Beer? Sure.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.760
So...

13:28.640 --> 13:31.920
- How are you feelin' about all this?
- Yes to the beer.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.000
No to the feelings.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.560
That's too bad, because
I don't really like beer.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.800
Stop your worryin'. I'm fine.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.600
Really? That's... that's funny...

13:47.760 --> 13:52.080
..because I didn't figure you for
the early-retirement type any more.

13:55.680 --> 14:00.120
- There's another reason you're angry.
- Oh, here we go. Pop psych 101 , right?

14:00.520 --> 14:02.720
No. When we were in the briefing,...

14:02.880 --> 14:07.680
..you said something about the Pentagon
not giving us the backup we requested.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.080
What, uh... what were you talking about?

14:16.520 --> 14:20.440
Hammond and I were planning
a secondary SGC base off-world.

14:21.560 --> 14:26.320
It was gonna serve as a backup if ours
was attacked. I was gonna command.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.840
Then the Pentagon pulled the plug?

14:30.400 --> 14:35.760
So you're acting up because you're hurt...
because you didn't get a command.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.160
Give me a break, Daniel.

14:39.440 --> 14:44.240
Denial of the programme shows they're
not serious about attaining our goals.

14:44.400 --> 14:49.520
- Which you think is attaining weapons?
- Protecting ourselves.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.880
But isn't our mission also about
establishing relations with other cultures?

14:54.440 --> 14:57.360
What for, if we gain nothing
to help our other interests?

14:57.680 --> 15:02.360
There's a lot we can learn from the Tollan
that has nothing to do with weapons.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.680
Stuff that interests people like you, Daniel.
Not people like me.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.280
I want to see tangible gains
from our efforts.

15:10.440 --> 15:14.680
And if people like the Tollan
don't want to share, we should just take.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.080
- You believe that?
- Being nice...

15:18.240 --> 15:21.160
..won't stop any Goa'uld
mother ships, if they come back.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.720
I'd rather be a thief and alive than honest
and dead. It's a cliche, but there it is.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.400
If you really believe that, I guess, uh...

15:31.440 --> 15:36.640
- ..l guess I never really knew you at all.
- Come on. You're a bright guy.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.120
You had to sense some of this.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.200
Then no. I...

15:48.480 --> 15:51.800
I guess you couldn't relate to me
any more than I could to you.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.200
So this friendship we've been
working on the last few years...

15:55.480 --> 15:58.200
Apparently, not much of
a foundation there, huh?

16:22.280 --> 16:24.000
(doorbell)

16:26.960 --> 16:28.680
(doorbell)

16:38.960 --> 16:40.840
Colonel O'Neill.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.720
What the hell is this? A joke, Maybourne?
What are you doin' here?

16:46.880 --> 16:49.120
Well, in a way, you invited me.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.680
Come to gloat about
my retirement, have you?

16:53.840 --> 16:56.080
- May I come in?
- No.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.120
I'm in no way obligated
to put up with your crap any more.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.320
I think you're gonna wanna hear
what I have to offer you.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.800
Offer?

17:17.119 --> 17:20.359
- May I sit down?
- No. You won't be here that long.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.240
What's this about?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.599
I heard about your little
altercation with General Hammond.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.680
Sweet little grapevine we got.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.200
Let's just say I see a lot of paper
that goes through the mountain.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.960
I was interested
in your passionate argument...

17:34.120 --> 17:39.160
..that we shouldn't be quite so diplomatic
about acquiring the things we need.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.200
Get to the point.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.160
What if I said I could offer you
a way to achieve your goals?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.400
- My goals?
- Yes.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.960
What if I said I could arrange for you
to lead a team through the gate...

17:50.120 --> 17:54.680
..to acquire whatever you want, whenever
you want? For the good of this country.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.520
If I believed you could do that, I'd have
to figure whatever you're doing is illegal.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.240
What you did yesterday
was illegal, Colonel.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.320
Get out.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.400
Not interested.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.960
Page me when you
miss the action too much.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.560
- For what purpose were we summoned?
- My guess is we're getting our fourth.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.440
Who do you think it'll be?

18:27.600 --> 18:30.320
Probably someone like Ferretti.
You'll get command.

18:30.480 --> 18:35.200
I don't know about that. They'll probably
go with someone higher than major.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.440
As you were.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.920
Since SG-1 is considered
the flagship unit,...

18:45.080 --> 18:48.800
..it falls on me to assure that
you have the strongest leadership.

18:48.960 --> 18:53.880
Therefore I'm reassigning our most senior
officer as your new commanding officer.

18:54.040 --> 18:59.080
Colonel Makepeace will be joining SG-1 .
I hope you'll make him feel welcome.

18:59.240 --> 19:03.160
Um, sir? Uh... I don't wanna
seem out of line here,...

19:03.320 --> 19:07.400
..but since I'm a civilian here, I'm probably
the only one who can say this...

19:07.560 --> 19:09.280
Spit it out, Doctor.

19:09.440 --> 19:14.720
Well, no offence, but doesn't Major
Carter deserve to take charge of SG-1?

19:14.880 --> 19:17.640
Major Carter has
an exemplary record on the team,...

19:17.800 --> 19:20.680
..as recognised by
her recent promotion to major.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.160
- But major is a far cry from colonel.
- I understand, General.

19:24.760 --> 19:29.080
I'm sorry, I don't. What difference does it
make what title she has? The point is...

19:29.280 --> 19:31.120
It's all right, Daniel. Really.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.000
Dismissed.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.480
I'm proud to join you folks.

19:41.200 --> 19:46.160
I hope you'll learn to trust my command
as much as you did Colonel O'Neill's.

19:46.320 --> 19:51.080
- I'm sure we will, sir.
- I never trusted Jack's command, but...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.560
- ..l'm open.
- That's good.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.240
Then I'll see you at our first briefing.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.160
- ( Leoncavallo's "I Pagliacci")
- (vehicle pulls up)

20:55.080 --> 20:57.040
What took you so long?

20:57.200 --> 21:00.840
I didn't think you'd get bored so fast,
or I would have stayed in town.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.960
Not quite the student of human behaviour
you thought you were?

21:06.120 --> 21:08.440
Are you ready to go?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.840
- I have some questions.
- Can't tell you much.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.080
You expect me to jump
into this operation blind?

21:18.120 --> 21:21.360
Are you interested in my offer or not?

21:33.240 --> 21:35.440
(turns up volume)

21:35.600 --> 21:37.920
I'm interested.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.360
Good.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.560
I want to be sure
you understand one thing, O'Neill.

21:43.720 --> 21:47.600
What I'm about to show you is
not so much "classified" as it is "secret".

21:47.960 --> 21:51.080
"Dangerous" would be
another word I would use.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.800
Keep talkin'.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.880
Understand that, once you see
what I'm about to show you,...

21:58.040 --> 22:00.040
..there is no turning back.

22:00.200 --> 22:04.320
You will have the choice
to go along with it... or disappear.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.280
Disappear?

22:08.080 --> 22:10.440
This is your last chance to back out.

22:15.840 --> 22:19.040
Well, if you promise
to cut back on the melodrama,...

22:20.880 --> 22:23.240
..l'll consider crossin' the line.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.760
- So, where are we going?
- Nowhere in particular.

22:32.960 --> 22:38.320
I find being 30,000 feet up greatly reduces
the chances of any effective surveillance.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.040
Do you know what this is?

23:08.200 --> 23:12.000
I assume it's one of those
Goa'uld communication balls.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.880
We didn't have to negotiate for it either.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.720
- Who's "we"?
- My organisation.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.120
- NID?
- Mmm... More of an offshoot.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.240
Ah. That sort of says it all, doesn't it?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.640
I want you to command a unit.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.240
- There are units?
- Oh, yes.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.160
Would you like to meet the temporary
commander of the unit I want you to run?

23:36.320 --> 23:37.760
I guess.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.080
Took us a while to figure out how to use
this without a Goa'uld at the controls.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.600
But good old human ingenuity
eventually won out.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.440
- Colonel Maybourne.
- Newman.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.640
I'd like you to meet
Colonel Jack O'Neill. Retired.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.520
It is a pleasure, sir. Read just about
all the SG-1 mission briefings...

24:03.680 --> 24:06.880
..and, uh... Well, let's just say
your file is very impressive.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.720
It'd be an honour to serve
under your command, Colonel.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.000
Hello, Newman.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.920
- You look familiar.
- Yes, sir. We have met briefly.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.640
In a hangar at a Utah landing strip.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.040
You're who we chased
through the other Stargate.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.640
That would be me.
I apologise about having to return fire, sir.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.320
Hm.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.640
- Where are you?
- He's on another planet.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.600
Your mission, Newman?

24:34.760 --> 24:38.160
Use any means necessary to acquire
technology to help Earth...

24:38.320 --> 24:41.840
..in the battle against the Goa'ulds
or other unforeseen aggressors.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.200
You've seen myfile, Newman.
It's only fair I know more about you.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.920
Need-to-know, Colonel.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.200
I need to know
if I'm to command this unit.

24:50.720 --> 24:54.920
You agree to go and take command, I'll
give you files on each one of your people.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.640
How about it? You ready for a command
where you can finally achieve...

24:58.800 --> 25:02.960
..what you and I both agree needs
to be achieved to defend this planet?

25:10.040 --> 25:13.840
I never thought I'd agree with you
about anything, Maybourne.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.200
But yeah.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.560
I'm ready.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.160
Major Carter has accepted my command
with no problem, sir.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.840
But I'm afraid Dr Jackson
and the Jaffa have not.

25:32.200 --> 25:37.400
Well, maybe if you didn't think of him
as "the Jaffa", it would be a good start.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.480
- (knock at door)
- Come in.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.240
Jack, come in.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.840
- You know Colonel Makepeace.
- Yeah.

25:48.400 --> 25:52.160
- How's the retirement going?
- Uh... great.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.880
I retire, I wake up, I retire.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.960
It's... it's a living.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.000
I'm bored out of my skull, sir.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.200
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:05.360 --> 26:09.400
- Something I can help you with?
- Actually, there is, General.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.520
Would you like me to leave, Jack?

26:11.680 --> 26:13.400
I don't care.

26:14.160 --> 26:18.480
- We're not finished, Colonel Makepeace.
- I'll make it fast, General.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.240
I'm hoping you could
grant me one last favour.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.240
I'm listening.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.960
I want to retire off-world.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.960
Jack, I don't know...

26:33.160 --> 26:37.320
You remember that woman I told you
about on Edora? Laira was her name.

26:37.480 --> 26:41.000
- Yes.
- I promised her I'd come back some day.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.240
I'm asking you
to help me keep that promise.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.560
Please.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.080
If I agree to do this,
you know I can't give you a GDO.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.960
That means you can never
return to Earth through the gate.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.200
I understand that, sir.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.440
Colonel...

27:55.400 --> 27:57.960
Colonel O'Neill. It is an honour, sir.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.480
Newman.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.360
We may look a little ragtag,
but we're very good at what we do.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.240
Which is... stealing stuff.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.320
Well, acquiring what we need
to defend our planet.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.760
And you measure how good you are by
the fact that you've never been caught?

28:27.920 --> 28:31.040
Well, and by the spoils of our missions.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.960
Would you care to take a gander
at one of our latest acquisitions?

28:35.120 --> 28:37.680
Sure. I'll take a gander.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.480
This way, sir.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.040
- What do you think?
- Just brought it back.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.960
- It's an anti-gravitation device.
- Really?

29:00.760 --> 29:05.360
- Lieutenant Clare Tobias, sir.
- Tobias. Jack O'Neill.

29:06.040 --> 29:11.000
If it's all right, sir, I'll leave you
in the lieutenant's very capable hands.

29:11.160 --> 29:14.080
So... tell me about this thing.

29:14.880 --> 29:20.400
It uses superconducted gyroscopic action
to generate an anti-gravitational field...

29:20.560 --> 29:22.280
Stop.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.400
- Scientist?
- Engineer. Why?

29:28.080 --> 29:31.040
You remind me of someone
in my old command.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.840
- Major Carter.
- How do you know her?

29:34.400 --> 29:37.120
She beat me out of a position in the SGC.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.680
Oh.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.920
So, what do you do around here?

29:43.080 --> 29:46.440
My job is to examine
some of the larger items we acquire.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.600
The ones too big to be
transported back to Earth.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.800
See if we can backwards-engineer them
and send the plans home to Maybourne.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.520
Sir, Colonel Maybourne
would like to talk to you.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.040
Yeah?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.120
Tobias.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.080
Jack! I see you made it in one piece.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.480
- What do you think of our little operation?
- It's swell, Harry.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.960
We do what we can to make it
comfortable. I have your first mission.

30:15.120 --> 30:19.880
- Planet PX3-595.
- About time we got one of those things.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.840
SG-9 was unable to negotiate
to get the device.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.280
- What device are we talkin' about?
- Newman can fill you in on all the details.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.320
Good luck, Colonel.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.800
- Thanks.
- And, Colonel, just a reminder.

30:34.240 --> 30:38.840
This isn't the SGC. So if someone
gets in your way, do what you have to do.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.720
OK, the mouth of the cave we're gonna hit
is 50 metres at two o'clock from the gate.

30:48.880 --> 30:53.440
The primitive locals are called Tiernods.
They use 'em to hide from predators.

30:53.600 --> 30:58.640
If a predator goes into the cave, Tiernods
use the device we're after to vanish.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.720
Very nice.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.400
- Clear.
- (Tobias) Bingo.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.080
You're gonna love this.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.760
- Pretty cool, huh?
- What the...?

31:46.160 --> 31:48.720
- That thing looks Asgard.
- It is.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.680
This is an Asgard-protected planet.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.680
Can you imagine the ways we could
use this for black ops on Earth?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.240
Yep.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.280
But it's not on Earth. You gonna be
able to backwards-engineer this thing?

32:05.440 --> 32:09.080
Don't have to. Items this small
we just send back to Earth.

32:09.240 --> 32:12.800
- How?
- Got a man on the inside, on an SG team.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.400
Maybourne tells us
where the mole's team will go.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.960
We get there first,
make the drop and come back.

32:18.120 --> 32:22.440
The mole comes in later, retrieves
the item and packs it back in his gear.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.640
It's about time he got back to us.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.920
Hello, team. You get the device?

32:34.080 --> 32:36.280
- Yep.
- Good.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.480
I have the time and coordinates
for the drop. Just drop and go.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.120
- No contact.
- OK.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.880
I'm sending the coordinates
and time info. Record them.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.040
(electronic signal)

32:51.640 --> 32:53.360
Alex?

32:56.880 --> 32:59.920
- Want me to go, sir?
- No. I'll go.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.840
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.120
Best way to understand a command
is to do every job yourself at least once.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.400
That's your prerogative, Colonel.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.400
(chevrons locking)

33:52.000 --> 33:56.520
All right, let's make this quick.
Carter, Dr Jackson, run your tests.

33:56.680 --> 34:00.480
Let's see if the intel was right
about naqahdah deposits here.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.200
How'd it go, sir?

35:57.360 --> 36:00.920
Maybourne had the coordinates right,
but his timing sucked!

36:01.240 --> 36:03.880
I just about ran into the SG team
on my way back.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.600
(rumbling)

36:05.760 --> 36:07.680
What's goin' on?!

36:09.680 --> 36:14.480
Sir... Sir, we do not open the gate without
direct orders from Colonel Maybourne!

36:14.640 --> 36:16.560
Colonel, what are you doin'?!

36:20.520 --> 36:22.880
Opening up some options!

36:27.320 --> 36:30.280
There's an Asgard ship
descending over the base!

36:40.760 --> 36:42.320
What are they doing?

36:42.640 --> 36:45.640
Taking back
what's rightfully theirs, I guess.

36:45.800 --> 36:49.160
Listen up, all of you.
You've got two choices here.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.600
Once they stop takin' stuff,
they're gonna start takin' people.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.360
Now, you can go with the Asgard.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.720
Or you can follow me. It's your choice.

36:58.440 --> 37:02.400
I'll be holdin' the door open
so you can't go anywhere else.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.520
(Stargate alarm)

37:31.280 --> 37:33.240
Hands together. Got you now, Newman.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.000
Good job, kids.
Give me one of those things.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.160
Here.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.400
What the hell...? What are you doing?!

37:40.560 --> 37:42.480
That would be my job.

37:44.840 --> 37:48.840
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to
announce that you are all under arrest...

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
..for high crimes against
the United States and its allies.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.760
(buzzer, door unlocking)

38:04.720 --> 38:08.920
- You really blew it, O'Neill.
- Oh, I think it came off quite nicely.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.000
- Don't you, General?
- Yes, I do.

38:11.160 --> 38:15.480
You have no idea how high up this goes.
You've pissed off the wrong people.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.760
Like the Tollan, Tok'ra, Asgard, Nox...
Those folks?

38:19.280 --> 38:23.120
They refuse to give us what we need
to defend ourselves against the Goa'uld.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.040
We don't need their stuff, Makepeace.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.640
We do need them.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.320
Get them out of here.

38:43.040 --> 38:46.760
So, just to, uh... clarify.

38:47.160 --> 38:50.720
This whole past week, beginning
with the appeal we made on Tollana,...

38:50.880 --> 38:55.560
..in which I did a lot of hard work
by the way, I take it that was all a scam?

38:55.720 --> 39:00.960
Within the last two weeks, the Asgard
and the Tollan approached us...

39:01.120 --> 39:04.440
..with evidence that we were
stealing technology from them.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.840
- We? The SGC?
- Yes.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.200
The Asgard, the Tollan and the Nox
were going to sever all ties with us.

39:11.840 --> 39:17.120
We convinced them the theft must be the
action of a rogue group outside the SGC.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.280
We insisted that you
apprehend them yourselves.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.880
You have now regained our trust.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.800
(Carter) So you set that
whole thing up on Tollana...

39:29.960 --> 39:32.680
..in the hopes that the mole
would approach you?

39:32.840 --> 39:35.760
And you didn't think
you could trust us to help?

39:35.920 --> 39:40.240
We wanted to assure your reaction to the
Colonel's behaviour was as it should be.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.640
And the Asgard insisted that
Colonel O'Neill be the only one involved.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.720
They like me.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.400
And now, will you come with me,
Your Eminence?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.400
I'm back.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.840
It's good to have you back, sir.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.920
- Indeed.
- Thank you.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.320
Um... Daniel?

40:18.480 --> 40:20.200
Mm.

40:21.560 --> 40:25.200
- That stuff I talked about at my house...
- Um...

40:25.360 --> 40:28.720
- It was bugged. I had to keep up the act.
- It's... I understand.

40:28.880 --> 40:32.680
Obviously, the whole friendship thing,
the foundation is solid.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.000
Uh, obviously. You don't...
You don't have to...

40:36.160 --> 40:38.280
No, I feel kind of...

40:38.440 --> 40:41.120
I do appreciate that
you came to see if I was OK.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.440
That... That means something.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.920
Uh... actually, no, it doesn't.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.240
- Huh?
- Um...

40:51.480 --> 40:53.400
We, uh, we drew straws.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.400
I lost.

41:13.600 --> 41:18.000
