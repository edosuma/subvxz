WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.674
Martha, have you met my friend?

00:02.753 --> 00:04.596
Always wanted to go to New York.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.548
November 1st, 1930.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.032
You only come to Hooverville
when there's nowhere else to go.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.969
Men going missing, is this true?

00:11.762 --> 00:12.934
Laszlo?

00:13.096 --> 00:18.102
The Empire State Building
must be completed in time.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.185
- Are you trying to kill us?
- Don't argue with me!

00:20.437 --> 00:23.441
This human is our best opt/on.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.108
No!

00:25.275 --> 00:28.279
The Final Experiment will begin.

00:28.403 --> 00:32.453
The children of Skaro must walk again.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.289
What is it?

00:34.409 --> 00:39.836
I am a human Dalek.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.425
These humans will become like me.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.592
Prepare them for hybridisation.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.843
Leave me alone. Don't you dare!

01:36.179 --> 01:37.977
What is that sound?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.939
Ah, well now, that would be me.

01:41.018 --> 01:44.272
Hello. Surprise! Boo! Etcetera.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.983
- Doctor?
- The enemy of the Daleks!

01:48.066 --> 01:50.285
- Exterminate!
- Wait!

01:52.195 --> 01:54.539
Well, then, a new form of Dalek.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.377
Fascinating and very clever.

01:58.869 --> 02:02.499
The Cult of Skaro
escaped your slaughter.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.050
How did you end up in 1930?

02:05.375 --> 02:08.002
Emergency temporal shift.

02:08.169 --> 02:12.596
Oh, that must've roasted up
your power cells, eh?

02:14.051 --> 02:17.681
Time was, four Daleks
could've conquered the world!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.895
But instead, you're skulking away,

02:21.725 --> 02:24.899
hidden in the dark, experimenting.

02:26.021 --> 02:31.118
- All of which results in you.
- I am Dalek in human form.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.245
But what does it feel like?

02:34.363 --> 02:36.331
You can talk to me, Dalek Sec.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.084
It is Dalek Sec, isn't it,
that's your name?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.207
You've got a name
and a mind of your own.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.254
Tell me what you're thinking right now.

02:43.455 --> 02:48.928
I feel humanity.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.217
Good, that's good.

02:51.338 --> 02:55.434
I feel everything

02:55.926 --> 02:58.145
we wanted from mankind,

02:58.970 --> 03:02.315
which is ambition,

03:03.725 --> 03:08.026
hatred, aggression and war.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.742
Such a genius for war...

03:11.817 --> 03:14.821
- No, that's not what humanity means.
- I think it does!

03:15.904 --> 03:22.253
At heart, this species is so very Dalek.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.705
All right,
so what have you achieved, then,

03:24.788 --> 03:27.792
with this Final Experiment, eh? Nothing!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.882
'Cause I can show you
what you're missing with this thing.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.429
A simple, little radio.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.303
What is the purpose of that device?

03:35.424 --> 03:36.471
Well, exactly.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.803
It plays music.
What's the point of that?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.143
Oh, with music, you can dance to it,

03:43.181 --> 03:44.728
sing with it,

03:45.809 --> 03:47.652
fall in love to it.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.949
Unless you're a Dalek, of course.
Then it's all just noise.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.996
- Run!
- Protect the hybrid!

03:58.113 --> 04:01.117
Protect! Protect! Protect!

04:07.539 --> 04:09.086
Report status.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.676
Pain. Pain of the flesh

04:15.338 --> 04:19.093
like no Dalek has felt
for thousands of years.

04:19.176 --> 04:24.182
- The Doctor has escaped!
- Then find him! Find him!

04:26.767 --> 04:31.318
Find the Doctor.
The prisoners must be recaptured.

04:33.148 --> 04:36.402
Come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

04:36.985 --> 04:41.866
- And you, Tallulah, run!
- What's happened to Laszlo?

04:57.047 --> 04:59.846
Come on, everyone up! Come on! Come on!

05:16.274 --> 05:18.527
They have ascended.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.697
Return to base!

05:27.327 --> 05:32.709
Request information.
What is your opinion of Dalek Sec?

05:32.791 --> 05:35.544
We were created to follow him.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.760
But you have doubts?

05:44.386 --> 05:45.888
Affirmative.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.980
These Daleks,
they sound like the stuff of nightmares.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.484
And they want to breed?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.987
They're splicing themselves
on to human bodies.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.943
And, if I'm right, they've got
a farm of breeding stock,

06:00.026 --> 06:02.154
right here in Hooverville.
You've got to get everyone out.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.456
Hooverville's the lowest place
a man can fall.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.748
There's nowhere else to go.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.168
I'm sorry, Solomon,
you've got to scatter, go anywhere,

06:08.285 --> 06:10.538
get on to the rail roads,
travel across state,

06:10.620 --> 06:11.917
just get out of New York.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.045
There's got to be a way
to reason with these things.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.543
- There's not a chance.
- You ain't seen 'em, boss.

06:16.835 --> 06:20.305
Daleks are bad enough at any time,
but right now, they're vulnerable.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.636
That makes them
more dangerous than ever.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.240
- They're coming! They're coming!
- A sentry must have seen something.

06:42.319 --> 06:46.165
They're here, I've seen them!
Monsters! They're monsters!

06:46.239 --> 06:47.286
It's started.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.414
We're under attack! Everyone to arms!

06:52.078 --> 06:53.204
I'm ready, boss.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.542
But all of you, find a weapon!
Use anything!

06:56.625 --> 07:01.222
Come back! We've got to stick together.
It's not safe out there, come back!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.606
Hurry, hurry! Come on!

07:17.938 --> 07:20.157
- We need to get out of the park.
- We can't.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.575
They're on all sides. They're driving
everyone back towards us.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.245
- We're trapped.
- Then we stand together!

07:25.320 --> 07:27.368
Gather round! Everybody come to me!

07:27.447 --> 07:30.826
You there, Jethro, Harry,
Seamus, stay together.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.628
They can't take all of us!

07:41.294 --> 07:43.638
If we can just hold them off
till daylight...

07:44.255 --> 07:47.259
Oh, Martha,
they're just the foot soldiers.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.182
Oh, my God!

08:00.939 --> 08:03.818
- What in this world...
- It's the devil. A devil in the sky.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.530
- God save us all, it's damnation.
- Oh, yeah? We'll see about that!

08:07.612 --> 08:09.285
That's not gonna work.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.000
Establish visual contact.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.129
Commence the attack.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.503
There's more than one of them.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.448
The humans will surrender!

08:47.527 --> 08:49.780
Leave them alone,
they've done nothing to you!

08:49.904 --> 08:52.623
We have located the Doctor.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.621
No, Solomon, stay back!

08:57.704 --> 09:01.334
I'm told that I'm addressing
the Daleks. Is that right?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.464
Observe humanity.

09:03.793 --> 09:08.469
For all their faults,
they have such courage.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.844
From what I hear, you're outcasts, too.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.687
- Solomon, don't.
- Doctor, this is my township.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.141
You will respect my authority.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.526
Just let me try.

09:23.480 --> 09:29.533
Daleks, ain't we the same?
Underneath, ain't we all kin?

09:34.157 --> 09:36.080
'Cause you see,

09:36.951 --> 09:39.704
I've just discovered, this past day,

09:40.205 --> 09:45.336
that God's universe is a thousand times
the size I thought it was.

09:46.169 --> 09:51.972
And that scares me. Oh, yeah,
terrifies me right down to the bone.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.020
But surely, it's got to give me hope,

09:56.763 --> 09:59.937
hope that, maybe together,

10:00.642 --> 10:03.065
we can make a better tomorrow.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.694
So I beg you now,

10:07.941 --> 10:11.696
if you have any compassion
in your hearts,

10:12.362 --> 10:15.992
then you'll meet with us
and stop this fight.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.587
Well?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.293
What do you say?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.418
Exterminate.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.880
Solomon!

10:32.423 --> 10:33.720
No! Solomon!

10:35.051 --> 10:38.305
They killed him.
They just shot him on the spot.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.933
Daleks!

10:43.560 --> 10:45.813
All right. So it's my turn.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.026
Then kill me.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.697
Kill me, if it'll stop you
attacking these people.

10:51.776 --> 10:56.122
I will be the destroyer
of our greatest enemy!

10:56.406 --> 11:00.286
Then do it! Do it! just do it!

11:00.368 --> 11:01.460
Do it!

11:01.578 --> 11:05.003
- Exterminate.
- Stop! I command you, stop!

11:05.957 --> 11:09.552
I do not understand. It is the Doctor!

11:10.461 --> 11:17.219
- But I want him alive.
- The urge to kill is too strong.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.355
I have decided. The Doctor must live.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.850
And you will obey me!

11:23.933 --> 11:26.812
I obey.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.990
- What's going on?
- Bring him to me.

11:31.983 --> 11:36.614
- You will follow.
- No. You can't go.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.202
I've got to go.
The Daleks just changed their minds,

11:42.285 --> 11:44.413
Daleks never change their minds.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.373
But what about us?

11:51.961 --> 11:53.508
One condition.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.473
If I come with you,
you spare the lives of everyone here.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.478
Do you hear me?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.518
Obey the Doctor.

12:02.597 --> 12:08.320
Humans will be spared. Doctor follow.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.648
- Then I'm coming with you.
- Martha, stay here.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.652
Do what you do best.
People are hurt, you can help them.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.161
Let me go.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.663
Oh, and can I just say

12:27.789 --> 12:29.507
thank you very much.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.768
You saved the Doctor. Why?

12:49.143 --> 12:50.986
He's a genius

12:51.646 --> 12:52.989
and we can use him.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.568
The future of the Daleks
might well depend upon the Doctor.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.496
Somebody help me!

13:07.370 --> 13:10.590
Here you go,
I got some more on the boil.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.042
Thanks.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.965
You'll be all right, it's just a cut.
Try and keep it clean.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.512
Thanks.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.476
So what about us? What do we do now?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.054
The Doctor gave me this.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.441
- He must've had a reason.
- What's that for?

13:28.599 --> 13:31.398
It gets you into places.
Buildings and things.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.064
- But where?
- He must want me to go somewhere,

13:34.147 --> 13:35.774
but what am I supposed to do?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.657
Those people were defenceless!

13:43.740 --> 13:46.539
You only wanted me, but no,
that wasn't enough for you,

13:46.617 --> 13:48.244
you had to start killing,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.330
'cause that's the only thing
a Dalek's good for.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.632
The deaths were wrong.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.585
I'm sorry?

13:57.545 --> 14:00.594
That man, their leader, Solomon,

14:01.841 --> 14:04.685
- he showed courage.
- And that's good?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.687
That's excellent.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.648
Is it me, or are you just becoming
a little bit more human?

14:11.893 --> 14:14.612
You are the last of your kind.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.694
And now I am the first of mine.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.069
What do you want me for?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.614
We tried everything to survive.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.668
When we found ourselves
stranded in this ignorant age,

14:29.577 --> 14:33.252
first we tried
growing new Dalek embryos,

14:33.790 --> 14:35.838
but their flesh was too weak.

14:35.958 --> 14:40.805
Yeah, I found one of your experiments
just left to die out there in the dark.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.507
It forced us to conclude

14:42.840 --> 14:46.014
what is the greatest resource
of this planet?

14:47.095 --> 14:48.472
Its people.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.838
We stole them.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.509
We stole human beings for our purpose.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.176
Look inside.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.861
This is the true extent
of the Final Experiment.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.035
- Is he dead?
- Near death.

15:44.986 --> 15:49.787
With his mind wiped,
ready to be filled with new ideas.

15:50.533 --> 15:54.208
- Dalek ideas.
- The human Dalek race.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.716
All of these people... How many?

16:00.501 --> 16:02.799
We have caverns beyond this

16:03.379 --> 16:05.381
storing more than 1,000.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.101
Is there any way to restore them,
to make them human again?

16:09.594 --> 16:13.064
Everything that they were has been lost.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.978
So they're like shells.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.276
You got empty human beings
ready to be converted.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.524
That's gonna take
a hell of a lot of power.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.402
This planet
hasn't even split the atom yet.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.778
How are you going to do it?

16:22.899 --> 16:24.742
Open the conductor plan.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.909
Wait a minute.

16:33.326 --> 16:37.923
Down in the sewers, the Daleks
mentioned this energy conductor.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.212
What does that mean?

16:41.125 --> 16:45.221
I don't know.
Maybe like a lightning conductor, or...

16:45.963 --> 16:47.556
- Dalekanium!
- Oh!

16:48.424 --> 16:51.473
They said the Dalekanium was in place.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.433
In place where?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.481
- Frank might know.
- Right.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.445
- Frank?
- Hmm?

17:01.938 --> 17:04.156
That Mr Diagoras,
he was like some sort of fixer, yeah?

17:04.482 --> 17:07.702
- Get you jobs all over town?
- Yeah, he could find a profit anywhere.

17:07.777 --> 17:11.372
- But where, though? What sort of things?
- You name it.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.874
We're all so desperate for work,

17:13.950 --> 17:17.625
you'd just hope Diagoras
would pick you something good.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.252
Building work, that pays the best.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.630
But what sort of building work?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.671
Mainly building that.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.976
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the Empire State Building.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.532
We're right underneath that.
I worked that out already, thanks.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.728
But what,
you've hijacked the whole building?

17:37.807 --> 17:41.357
- We needed an energy conductor.
- What for?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.731
I am the genetic template.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.486
My altered DNA was to be administered
to each human body.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.867
A strong enough blast of gamma radiation

17:52.947 --> 17:56.542
can splice the Dalek
and human genetic codes

17:56.659 --> 17:59.708
and waken each body from its sleep.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.207
Gamma radiation? What...

18:03.165 --> 18:05.634
Oh, the sun. You're using the sun.

18:05.710 --> 18:10.591
Soon, the greatest solar flare
for 1,000 years will hit the Earth.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.052
Gamma radiation
will be drawn to the energy conductor.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.725
- And when it strikes...
- The army wakes.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.565
I still don't know what you need me for.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.108
Your genius.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.317
Consider a pure Dalek.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.234
Intelligent but emotionless.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.074
Removing the emotions
makes you stronger.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.615
That's what your creator thought
all those years ago.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.576
- He was wrong.
- He was what?

18:39.035 --> 18:41.629
It makes us lesser than our enemies.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.375
We must return to the flesh

18:46.042 --> 18:48.386
and also the heart.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.259
You wouldn't be
the supreme beings any more.

18:51.339 --> 18:55.344
- And that is good.
- 7' hat is incorrect!

18:55.426 --> 18:58.054
- Daleks are supreme!
- No!

18:58.137 --> 19:01.141
- Not any more.
- But that is our purpose!

19:01.223 --> 19:03.146
Then our purpose is wrong!

19:03.225 --> 19:06.274
Where has our quest for supremacy
led us?

19:06.395 --> 19:10.741
To this. Hiding in the sewers
on a primitive world.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.577
Just four of us left.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.657
If we do not change now,

19:18.157 --> 19:20.376
then we deserve extinction.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.580
So you want to change everything
that makes a Dalek a Dalek?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.257
If you can help me.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.669
I've always wanted to go
to the Empire State!

19:29.752 --> 19:31.595
I never imagined it
quite like this, though.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.305
Where are we headed, anyway?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.345
The top, where they're still building.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.894
Hey, how come those guys
just let us through?

19:37.968 --> 19:39.436
How does that thing work?

19:39.512 --> 19:43.267
Psychic paper, shows them
whatever I want them to think.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.519
According to this, we're two engineers
and an architect.

19:46.644 --> 19:50.990
Your knowledge of genetic engineering
is even greater than ours.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.161
The new race must be ready
by the time the solar flare erupts.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.121
But you're the template. I thought
they were getting a dose of you.

19:58.197 --> 20:02.828
- I want to change the gene sequence.
- To make them even more human.

20:02.952 --> 20:07.458
Humans are the great survivors.
We need that ability.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.212
Hold on a minute, though.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.043
There's no way this lot
are gonna let you do it.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.845
I am their leader.

20:12.920 --> 20:17.141
- Oh, and that's enough for you, is it?
- Daleks must follow orders.

20:17.675 --> 20:21.054
Dalek Sec commands. We obey.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.310
If you don't help me,
nothing will change.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.563
There's no room on Earth
for another race of people.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.363
You have your Tardis.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.484
Take us across the stars.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.865
Find us a new home

20:37.611 --> 20:41.457
and allow the new Daleks to start again.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.832
- When's that solar flare?
- Eleven minutes.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.340
Right, then!

20:50.291 --> 20:52.089
Better get to work!

20:57.548 --> 20:59.266
Look at this place!

20:59.925 --> 21:01.598
Top of the world!

21:03.429 --> 21:05.397
Okay, now this looks good.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.937
Hey, look at the date.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.022
These designs were issued today.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.982
They must have changed something
last minute.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.201
You mean
the Daleks changed something?

21:17.318 --> 21:18.695
Yeah, could be.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.538
The ones underneath,
they're from before.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.955
That means whatever they changed must be
on this top sheet but not on this one.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.002
- We need to check one against the other.
- All right.

21:27.077 --> 21:30.172
The height of this place.
This is amazing!

21:30.247 --> 21:32.466
Careful! We're 100 ﬂoors up,
don't go wandering off.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.884
I just wanna see.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.146
New York City.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.476
If aliens had to come to Earth,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.942
oh, no wonder they came here.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.163
There's no point in
chromosomal grafting, it's too erratic.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.582
We need to split the genome

22:04.657 --> 22:08.002
and force the new Dalek human sequence
right into the cortex.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.000
We need more chromatin solution.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.081
The Pig Slaves have it.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.588
These Pig Slaves,
what happens to them in the grand plan?

22:18.712 --> 22:23.513
Nothing. They're just simple beasts.
Their life span is limited.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.061
None survive beyond a few weeks.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.808
Power up the line feeds.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.617
Laszlo, I can't undo
what they've done to you.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.945
But they won't do it to anyone else.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.072
Do you trust him?

22:48.075 --> 22:51.579
I know that one man
can change the course of history.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.505
The right idea, in the right place,
at the right time, that's all it takes.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.836
I've got to believe it's possible.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.595
I'll go and keep an eye out,
make sure we're safe up here.

23:07.678 --> 23:11.057
- Don't want nobody butting in.
- There's a hell of a storm moving in.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.485
I wish the Doctor was here.
He'd know what we're looking for.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.280
So tell me.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.657
Where did you and him first hook up?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.986
It was in hospital. Sort of.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.117
'Course, him being a doctor.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.749
Actually, I'm the doctor.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.577
- Well, kind of.
- You're a physician?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.000
Really?

23:34.163 --> 23:37.337
I was training.
Still am, if I ever get back home.

23:38.292 --> 23:42.172
You could be doctors together.
What a partnership!

23:42.671 --> 23:44.344
Ah, such a shame.

23:44.798 --> 23:48.894
If only he wasn't so different,
you know what I mean?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.688
Oh, you have no idea
how different he really is.

23:51.805 --> 23:55.025
Yeah, he's a man, sweetheart.
That's different enough.

23:59.021 --> 24:03.367
He had this companion a while back,
this friend.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.201
And ever since then,
he's been on his own.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.915
But you know, sometimes,
I say something, or do something,

24:10.032 --> 24:12.501
and he looks at me
and I just sort of think

24:16.538 --> 24:18.211
that he's not seeing me.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.343
He's just remembering.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.546
Oh, listen, sweetheart,

24:24.713 --> 24:26.761
you want to get all sad,

24:26.924 --> 24:29.393
you want to have a contest
with me and Laszlo?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.933
No.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.182
But listen,
if the Doctor's with Laszlo now,

24:34.264 --> 24:36.733
there's every chance
that he could get him out.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.402
And then what?

24:39.186 --> 24:42.986
Don't talk crazy.
There's no future for me and him.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.193
Those Dalek things took that away.

24:47.736 --> 24:51.036
The one good thing I had in my life
and they destroyed it.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.001
The line feeds are ready.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.209
- Then it's all systems go!
- The solar flare is imminent.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.462
The radiation will reach Earth
in a matter of minutes.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.838
And we'll be ready for it.

25:05.921 --> 25:09.221
That compound will allow the gene bonds
to reconfigure in a brand new pattern.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.721
Power up!

25:13.053 --> 25:15.101
Start the line feeds.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.239
- There goes the gene solution.
- The life blood.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.304
Gotcha! Look!

25:49.882 --> 25:53.512
There, on the mast, those little lines,
they're new.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.392
They've added something, see?

25:55.471 --> 25:57.098
Added what?

26:01.977 --> 26:04.150
- Dalekanium!
- Dalekanium!

26:06.231 --> 26:07.574
What's that?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.162
What's happening?
Is there a malfunction?

26:12.946 --> 26:14.038
Answer me!

26:14.114 --> 26:16.208
No, no, no. The gene feed!

26:16.325 --> 26:18.748
- They're overriding the gene feed.
- Impossible!

26:18.827 --> 26:20.750
They cannot disobey orders.

26:21.205 --> 26:25.836
The Doctor will step away
from the controls.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.925
Stop! You will not fire!

26:29.213 --> 26:32.467
He is an enemy of the Daleks.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.598
And so are you.

26:34.676 --> 26:38.772
I am your commander. I am Dalek Sec!

26:39.014 --> 26:44.566
- You have lost your authority.
- You are no {anger a Dalek.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.438
What have you done?
What's going into the gene feed?

26:46.522 --> 26:50.493
The new bodies will be 700% Dalek.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.820
No! You can't do this!

26:53.320 --> 26:57.826
Pig Slaves, restrain Dalek Sec
and the Doctor.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.628
Release me!

27:02.079 --> 27:05.253
I created you! I am your master!

27:06.333 --> 27:08.301
Solar flare approaching!

27:08.377 --> 27:10.300
Prepare to intercept!

27:10.879 --> 27:13.177
- There's the lift.
- After you.

27:16.093 --> 27:20.348
The Doctor is escaping.
Stop him! Stop him!

27:20.764 --> 27:22.516
We've only got minutes

27:22.599 --> 27:23.976
before the gamma radiation
reaches the earth.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.229
We need to get
to the top of the building.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.481
Laszlo, what's wrong?

27:28.564 --> 27:30.817
Out of breath. It's nothing.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.412
We escaped them, Doctor,
that's all that matters.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.748
You have betrayed me.

27:43.745 --> 27:46.089
You told us to imagine.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.502
And we imagined your irrelevance.

27:49.585 --> 27:54.011
I was your leader! I am Dalek Sec!

27:54.089 --> 27:55.432
Obey me!

27:57.593 --> 27:59.345
- Doctor!
- First floor, perfumery.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.897
I never thought I'd see you again!

28:02.097 --> 28:03.724
No stopping me.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.185
We've worked it out.
We know what they've done.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.896
There's Dalekanium on the mast and
it's good to see you, too, by the way.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.526
Oh, come here!

28:11.523 --> 28:13.275
No. no, no, no, no, no, no!

28:13.400 --> 28:15.494
See, never waste time with a hug!

28:15.777 --> 28:17.857
- Deadlock seal, I can't stop it.
- Where's it going?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.328
Back down to the Daleks and they aren't
gonna leave us alone up here.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.626
- What's the time?
- 11:15.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.541
Six minutes to go!
I've got to remove the Dalekanium

28:24.620 --> 28:26.088
before the gamma radiation hits.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.461
Gammon radiation? What the heck is that?

28:33.337 --> 28:35.180
Oh, that's high.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.257
That's very... Blimey, that's high.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.309
And we've got to go even higher.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.512
That's the mast, up there, look.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.519
There's three pieces of Dalekanium
on the base. We've got to get 'em off.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.892
That's not we, that's just me.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.694
I'm not gonna just stand here
and watch you.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.066
No, you're gonna have
your hands full anyway.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.364
I'm sorry, Martha,
but you've got to fight.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.822
Confirm time until solar intercept.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.906
Gamma strike, four minutes and counting!

29:44.866 --> 29:50.373
Pig Slaves will take the lift!
Find the Doctor! Kill him!

29:58.755 --> 30:01.383
- The lift's coming up.
- I should have brought that gun.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.389
Tallulah, stay back. You, too, Martha.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.433
If they send Pig Slaves,
they're trained to kill.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.185
The Doctor needs me to fight,
I'm not going anywhere.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.062
But they're savages. I should know.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.769
They're trained to slit your throat
with their bare teeth.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.148
Laszlo, what is it?

30:16.356 --> 30:18.859
No, it's nothing, I'm fine.
Just leave me.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.580
Oh, honey, you're burning up.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.200
What's wrong with you? Tell me!

30:26.283 --> 30:28.411
One man down, we ain't even started yet.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.211
- It's not looking good, Frank.
- No.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.917
We're gonna get slaughtered.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.680
Wait a minute.

30:41.757 --> 30:42.804
Lightning!

31:02.736 --> 31:05.831
You'll be all right, sweetheart.
Don't you worry.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.833
What the hell are you two clowns doing?

31:08.950 --> 31:11.703
Even if the Doctor stops the Dalekanium,
this place is still gonna get hit.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.631
Great big bolt of lightning!
Electricity all down the building!

31:14.706 --> 31:16.754
Connect this to the lift,
and they get zapped!

31:16.833 --> 31:19.757
- Oh, my God, that could work!
- Then give us a hand!

31:21.630 --> 31:25.806
Gamma strike imminent. In 40 rels,

31:26.093 --> 31:28.767
39, 38,

31:28.845 --> 31:30.347
37...

31:44.903 --> 31:47.031
- Is that gonna work?
- It's got to!

31:47.155 --> 31:49.408
I got it all piped up
to the scaffolding outside.

31:49.491 --> 31:50.583
Come here, Frank,
just sit in the middle.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.787
- Don't touch anything metal!
- Okay.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.670
I can't!

31:57.749 --> 32:01.094
12, 11, 10...

32:16.643 --> 32:19.317
zero! Gamma strike!

32:40.625 --> 32:43.174
The army awakes.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.916
You did it, Martha.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.750
They used to be like Laszlo.
They were people.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.214
And I killed them.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.258
No. The Daleks killed them.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.508
Long ago.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.432
What about the Doctor?

33:40.852 --> 33:43.150
You will identify.

33:43.230 --> 33:48.657
- I am a Dalek.
- Excellent

33:48.944 --> 33:51.788
Begin the invasion of Manhattan.

33:52.030 --> 33:56.627
The population
will be converted into Daleks.

33:57.160 --> 34:02.007
Ana' from this island,
we will conquer the world!

34:02.082 --> 34:06.679
Assume battle positions! Take arms!

34:22.936 --> 34:24.152
Doctor!

34:25.813 --> 34:27.110
Doctor?

34:27.983 --> 34:29.735
Look what we found.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.945
Halfway down.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.036
You're getting careless.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.830
Oh, my head!

34:40.411 --> 34:41.833
Hiya.

34:42.205 --> 34:43.331
Hi.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.543
- You survived, then.
- So did you.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.045
Just about.

34:48.168 --> 34:52.639
I can't help noticing
there's Dalekanium still attached.

35:15.905 --> 35:20.911
War demands strategy.
I am designated Controller!

35:21.494 --> 35:23.417
That was to be my position.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.624
You are unfit!

35:25.707 --> 35:31.464
Connect me to the military computer.
I will coordinate all units.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.223
The Daleks will have gone
straight to a war footing.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.471
They'll be using the sewer system.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.302
Spreading the soldiers out
underneath Manhattan.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.013
- How do we stop them?
- There's only one chance.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.148
I got in the way.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.943
That gamma strike
went zapping through me first.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.426
Yeah, but what does that mean?

35:46.436 --> 35:47.528
We need to draw fire.

35:47.604 --> 35:49.151
Before they can attack New York,
I need to face them.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.322
Where can I draw them out?

35:50.398 --> 35:51.650
Think, think, think, think, think.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.532
I need some sort of space, somewhere
safe, somewhere out of the way.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.034
- Tallulah!
- That's me, three l's and an h!

35:57.113 --> 35:58.513
The theatre! It's right above them!

35:58.531 --> 36:00.158
And what, it's gone midnight.
Can you get us inside?

36:00.241 --> 36:02.335
- Don't see why not.
- Is there another lift?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.333
We came up in the service elevator.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.665
That'll do! Allons-y!

36:07.832 --> 36:09.834
Report status!

36:09.918 --> 36:15.596
Maximum efficiency!
I am now ready for full-scale war!

36:16.299 --> 36:21.146
- Control over Dalek humans?
- Connection confirmed!

36:21.262 --> 36:23.606
All soldiers will take heed!

36:25.058 --> 36:27.607
Weapons will be primed!

36:30.897 --> 36:33.275
This should do it. Here we go.

36:34.776 --> 36:38.155
There ain't nothing more creepy
than a theatre in the dark.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.159
Listen, Doctor, I know you've got
a thing for show tunes,

36:42.283 --> 36:44.536
but there's a time and a place, huh?

36:45.120 --> 36:47.293
Laszlo? What's wrong?

36:48.623 --> 36:51.627
Nothing. It's just so hot.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.505
But it's freezing in here.

36:54.838 --> 36:57.011
Doctor, what's happening to him?

36:57.132 --> 36:58.634
Not now, Tallulah, sorry.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.843
What are you doing?

36:59.926 --> 37:01.018
If the Daleks are going to war,

37:01.136 --> 37:03.559
they'll want to find
their number one enemy.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.811
I'm just telling them where I am.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.815
Sonic device detected!

37:10.019 --> 37:15.196
- The Doctor survived!
- Find him and exterminate!

37:15.275 --> 37:17.715
I'm telling you to go.
Frank can take you back to Hooverville.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.279
And I'm telling you, I'm not going.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.989
Martha! That's an order!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.619
Who are you then, some sort of Dalek?

37:25.326 --> 37:27.374
Doctor! Oh, my God!

37:31.583 --> 37:36.430
- Well, I guess that's them, then, huh?
- Humans with Dalek DNA?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.677
It's all right.
All right, just stay calm.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.998
- Don't antagonise them.
- But what of the Dalek masters?

37:41.009 --> 37:42.056
Where are they?

37:42.135 --> 37:46.515
Doctor located! Advance! Advance!

38:12.874 --> 38:16.879
The Doctor
will stand before the Daleks.

38:23.760 --> 38:29.267
You will die, Doctor.
It's the beginning of a new age.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.103
Planet Earth will become new Skaro!

38:33.394 --> 38:35.146
Oh, and what a world.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.777
With anything just the slightest bit
different ground into the dirt.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.738
That's Dalek Sec! Don't you remember?

38:42.862 --> 38:46.662
The cleverest Dalek ever
and look what you've done to him.

38:47.909 --> 38:51.129
Is that your new empire? Hmm?

38:52.372 --> 38:55.546
Is that the foundation
for a whole new civilisation?

38:55.959 --> 38:57.256
My Daleks,

38:59.754 --> 39:01.597
just understand this.

39:02.257 --> 39:05.306
If you choose death and destruction,

39:06.386 --> 39:09.356
then death and destruction
will choose you.

39:09.639 --> 39:13.360
Incorrect! We always survive.

39:13.977 --> 39:18.448
Now we will destroy our greatest enemy,
the Doctor.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.858
But he can help you.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.194
The Doctor must die!

39:22.652 --> 39:27.408
- No, I beg you, don't...
- Exterminate!

39:35.164 --> 39:36.791
Your own leader.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.212
The only creature who might have
led you out of the darkness,

39:40.295 --> 39:42.263
and you destroyed him.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.259
Did you see what they did? Huh?

39:46.301 --> 39:47.848
Do you see what a Dalek really is?

39:47.969 --> 39:52.816
Warning! Dalek humans
show increased levels of serotonin!

39:52.974 --> 39:56.478
If I'm gonna die, let's give the new
boys a shot, what do you think, eh?

39:57.312 --> 39:59.781
The Dalek humans. Their first blood.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.777
Go on! Baptise them!

40:03.860 --> 40:06.864
Dalek humans, take aim.

40:11.826 --> 40:15.205
What are you waiting for?
Give the command!

40:15.288 --> 40:17.165
Exterminate!

40:19.167 --> 40:21.169
Exterminate!

40:23.296 --> 40:26.926
Obey! Dalek humans will obey!

40:27.008 --> 40:28.851
They're not firing.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.395
What have you done?

40:30.595 --> 40:32.597
You will obey!

40:32.680 --> 40:35.354
- Exterminate!
- Why?

40:35.433 --> 40:39.188
- Daleks do not question orders!
- But why?

40:39.312 --> 40:42.782
- You will stop this!
- But why?

40:42.857 --> 40:45.076
You must not question!

40:45.818 --> 40:51.951
But you are not our master.
And we... We are not Daleks.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.039
No, you're not.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.212
And you never will be.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.508
Sorry.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.961
I got in the way
of the lightning strike.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.639
Time Lord DNA got all mixed up.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.555
Just that little bit of freedom.

41:09.634 --> 41:13.935
If they will not obey,
then they must die.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.024
Get down!

41:17.725 --> 41:19.477
Exterminate!

41:23.731 --> 41:25.483
Exterminate!

41:26.067 --> 41:30.618
Destroy the hybrids!
Destroy and exterminate!

41:40.748 --> 41:44.423
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. You did it.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.674
You're free.

41:45.753 --> 41:50.759
The Dalek humans are failures!
Destruct! Destruct! Destruct!

41:53.511 --> 41:54.637
No!

42:02.979 --> 42:07.280
- They can't, they can't, they can't!
- What happened? What was that?

42:07.859 --> 42:10.453
They killed them,
rather than let them live.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.998
An entire species.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.913
Genocide.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.917
Only two of the Daleks
have been destroyed.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.337
One of the Dalek masters
must still be alive.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.135
Oh, yes.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.303
In the whole universe,

42:34.343 --> 42:35.845
just one.

42:41.184 --> 42:45.360
- Now what?
- You will be exterminated!

42:45.480 --> 42:48.575
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. just think
about it, Dalek what-was-your-name?

42:48.649 --> 42:50.151
Dalek Caan.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.408
Dalek Caan.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.039
Your entire species has been wiped out

43:00.661 --> 43:03.505
and now the Cult of Skaro
has been eradicated,

43:05.333 --> 43:07.006
leaving only you.

43:09.337 --> 43:12.466
Right now, you're facing
the only man in the universe

43:12.548 --> 43:14.596
who might show you some compassion.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.727
'Cause I've just seen one genocide.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.360
I won't cause another.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.902
Caan,

43:31.567 --> 43:32.944
let me help you.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.746
- What do you say?
- Emergency temporal shift!

43:43.996 --> 43:46.294
Doctor! Doctor!

43:47.416 --> 43:48.759
He's sick.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.422
It's okay. You're all right.

43:58.678 --> 44:01.852
It's his heart. It's racing like mad.
I've never seen anything like it.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.478
What is it, Doctor?

44:03.558 --> 44:04.810
What's the matter with him?

44:04.892 --> 44:07.020
He says he can't breathe. What is it?

44:07.103 --> 44:09.401
It's time, sweetheart.

44:09.856 --> 44:12.735
What do you mean, "time"?
What are you talking about?

44:13.234 --> 44:18.035
None of the slaves survive for long.
Most of them only live for a few weeks.

44:19.699 --> 44:21.167
I was lucky.

44:22.577 --> 44:24.796
I held on 'cause I had you.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.044
But now...

44:27.456 --> 44:29.129
I'm dying, Tallulah.

44:29.250 --> 44:32.675
No, you're not. Not now, after all this.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.757
Doctor, can't you do something?

44:38.342 --> 44:40.970
Oh, Tallulah, with three l's and an h,

44:43.181 --> 44:46.025
just you watch me. What do I need?

44:46.100 --> 44:49.149
Oh, I don't know, how about
a great, big genetic laboratory?

44:49.270 --> 44:51.113
Oh, look! I've got one!

44:51.772 --> 44:53.991
Laszlo, just you hold on!

44:54.066 --> 44:57.991
There's been too many deaths today.
Way too many people have died.

44:58.279 --> 45:01.249
Brand-new creatures and wise old men
and age-old enemies.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.952
And I'm telling you,
I'm telling you right now,

45:04.076 --> 45:08.957
I am not having one more death!
You got that? Not one!

45:09.790 --> 45:11.918
Tallulah, out of the way.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.010
The Doctor is in!

45:20.676 --> 45:24.556
Well, I talked to them and I told them
what Solomon would've said,

45:24.639 --> 45:26.858
and I reckon
I shamed one or two of them.

45:27.183 --> 45:28.901
What did they say?

45:29.518 --> 45:31.145
They said yes.

45:32.438 --> 45:34.440
They'll give you a home, Laszlo.

45:35.816 --> 45:39.446
I mean, don't imagine
people ain't gonna stare.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.824
I can't promise you'll be at peace.

45:43.616 --> 45:46.460
But, in the end,
that is what Hooverville is for.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.247
People who ain't got nowhere else.

45:50.373 --> 45:51.750
Thank you.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.673
I...I can't thank you enough.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.601
Do you reckon it's gonna work?

46:02.677 --> 46:04.600
- Those two?
- I don't know.

46:05.763 --> 46:08.107
Anywhere else in the universe,
I might worry about them.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.605
But New York?
That's what this city's good at.

46:10.935 --> 46:13.939
Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses

46:14.021 --> 46:17.116
and maybe the odd Pig Slave-Dalek
mutant hybrid, too.

46:17.233 --> 46:21.283
- The pig and the showgirl!
- The pig and the showgirl.

46:21.362 --> 46:25.538
Just proves it, I suppose.
There's someone for everyone.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.703
Maybe.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.052
I meant to say, I'm sorry.

46:37.128 --> 46:38.300
What for?

46:38.379 --> 46:41.223
Just 'cause that Dalek got away.
I know what that means to you.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.471
Mmm.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.973
Do you think you'll ever see it again?

46:45.052 --> 46:46.395
Oh, yes.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.062
One day.

47:00.776 --> 47:04.121
Tonight, I'm going to perform a miracle.

47:05.031 --> 47:06.408
Something's wrong.

47:06.490 --> 47:10.461
I'm 76 years old and I am reborn.

47:10.745 --> 47:13.214
- This is a friend of mine.
- Lovely to meet you, Mrs Jones.

47:13.289 --> 47:14.415
Tish!

47:16.167 --> 47:18.135
You people
are in serious danger!

47:18.210 --> 47:20.258
You need to get out of here right now!

47:23.883 --> 47:25.977
No, get away from her!

47:26.469 --> 47:28.142
There's one more.
