[Footsteps Approaching]

03:15.280 --> 03:18.320
I had never thought
much about it before.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.480
I guess that's because I always
felt like such an alien myself--

03:21.560 --> 03:25.440
that to be concerned with aliens
from other planets...

03:25.480 --> 03:28.040
that just seemed
so... redundant.

03:28.120 --> 03:32.080
I'd never considered it much myself
before I started this job.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.840
If I understand it correctly,
your partner is the actual expert ?

03:37.960 --> 03:42.320
Yes, and I must apologize for his
refusal to speak with you, Mr. Chung.

03:42.400 --> 03:47.760
But I probably wouldn’t have myself if
I wasn't such an admirer of your work.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.840
- Oh !
- The Lonely Buddha is one
of my favorite novels.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.320
Here I was thinking you were
just some brainy beauty.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.840
Now I find out
you also have good taste.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.680
What made you decide to write
a book on an alien abduction,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.040
if you’re not that
interested in the subject ?

04:06.120 --> 04:08.720
It was
my publisher's idea.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.120
I was reluctant,

04:11.160 --> 04:16.640
until I realized I had an opportunity to
create an entirely new literary genre:

04:16.760 --> 04:19.760
the nonfiction science fiction.

04:19.880 --> 04:24.240
That gimmick alone will guarantee
its landing on the best-seller list.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.040
In short, to answer
your question, money.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.080
just as long as you're
attempting to record the truth.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.920
- How can I possibly do that ?
- What do you mean ?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.480
I spent three months
in Klass County.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.720
Everybody there has a different
version of what truly happened.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.920
Truth is as subjective
as reality.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.200
That will help explain why when people
talk about their U.F. O. experiences...

04:49.320 --> 04:51.280
they always start off with,

04:51.360 --> 04:54.400
"I know how crazy this is
going to sound, but--"

04:54.480 --> 04:57.440
So you’re here to get
my version of the truth ?

04:57.480 --> 05:00.560
Exactly.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.520
When did you first find out
about the case ?

05:03.600 --> 05:07.280
Well, not right away, of course.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.400
Not enough time had elapsed for it to
be considered a missing persons case...

05:11.480 --> 05:14.480
before the girl was found
the following morning.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.360
[Scully's Voice]
She was suffering from what
my partner calls "missing time. "

05:18.440 --> 05:20.680
She recalled nothing
of the previous night...

05:20.800 --> 05:24.200
nor how she had arrived
at her present whereabouts.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.760
Her body exhibited signs
of physical abuse.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.480
All of her clothes were on
inside out and backwards.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.560
All of her clothes were on
inside out and backwards.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.600
Hmph. Have I had my share
of mornings like that.

05:35.680 --> 05:39.640
But these are the characteristics
of someone who has--

05:39.680 --> 05:43.840
Do you prefer the term "abductee"
or "experiencer" ?

05:43.920 --> 05:47.760
I prefer neither, but
my partner uses abductee.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.960
My preference
is for the other.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.720
"I’ve just had
a little alien experience."

05:53.800 --> 05:57.600
As opposed to,
"I’ve just been abducted !"

05:57.680 --> 06:00.560
Regardless, the girl was
considered neither at the time.

06:00.640 --> 06:05.400
She appeared more to be the victim
of date rape than anything else.

06:05.440 --> 06:10.640
She was given a physical exam,
and her statement was taken.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.520

back at his own home.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.480
you were abducted by creatures

- Yes, I am.
- Well, too bad.

But he did take a test and passed it ?

[Scully's Voice] And he stuck
to his story... until we got there.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.880
If she says I raped her,
then I guess I raped her.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.240
You don't sound
so sure of that.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.760

08:06.840 --> 08:10.120
I don't know why Chrissy
remembers it that way.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.160
Would you be willing to take
a lie detector test to prove
that you raped her ?

08:15.240 --> 08:17.400
No, I'm not.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.680
That's too bad,

08:19.760 --> 08:23.760
because the next rape you experience
will probably be your own in prison.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.360
[Scully's Voice] That should
have ended our interrogation,

08:26.440 --> 08:28.920
but Mulder brought the girl in
for questioning.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.919
Are you having
trouble sleeping ?

08:33.000 --> 08:37.200
Are you experiencing muscle pains ?
Vision problems ?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.559

08:41.600 --> 08:43.559
When you look at
a particular object,

08:43.600 --> 08:47.000
do you receive the sudden flash
that you’re looking at something else,

08:47.080 --> 08:49.560
- like an alien's face ?
- Yes !

08:49.640 --> 08:52.880
[Scully's Voice] So my partner
became convinced she was suffering...

08:52.960 --> 08:55.640
from what he calls
post-abduction syndrome.

can cause all of those ailments.

09:01.920 --> 09:07.080
In any case, Mulder convinced
the girl and her parents
to let her be hypnotized.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.000
What is your opinion
of hypnosis ?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.960
I know it has
its therapeutic value,

09:13.040 --> 09:16.640
but it has never been
proven to enhance memory.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.360
In fact, it actually
worsens it...

09:19.440 --> 09:22.720
since people in that state
are prone to confabulation.

- Still, as a storyteller,

09:56.560 --> 09:59.040

09:59.120 --> 10:02.120
how a person's sense
of consciousness...

10:02.200 --> 10:07.880
can be so transformed
by nothing more magical...

10:07.920 --> 10:12.160

the presence of another human being

It's all characteristic

That's my problem with it.
It's all a little too typical.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.760
Abduction lore has
become so prevalent in our society...

When I came to, I immediately
ran to Chrissy's to make sure
she was there and she was okay.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.040
Harold, did you
and Chrissy engage...

15:17.120 --> 15:20.240
in consensual sexual
intercourse that night ?

15:25.720 --> 15:29.160
If her father finds out,
I'm a dead man.

15:29.240 --> 15:33.640
He said it happened before the
abduction. So what if they had sex ?

15:33.680 --> 15:37.360
So we know it wasn't
an alien that probed her.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.360
You've got two kids having sex
before they're mature enough
to know how to handle it.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.200
You're saying all this is just a case
of sexual trauma ?

15:44.280 --> 15:47.200
It's a lot more plausible
than an alien abduction,

15:47.280 --> 15:50.880
especially in light of
their contradictory stories.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.840
Hey ! I just got a call
from some crazy bleep-head,

15:53.920 --> 15:56.680
claiming he was an eyewitness
to this alien abduction.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.320
You feel like talking
to this blank-hole ?

15:59.400 --> 16:04.240
I know how crazy all this sounds,
but I don't care.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.640
What I have to say
has to be said.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.440
Why did you wait till now to tell us
this information ?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.880
Two kids' lives
may be affected by it.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.680
It's bigger than
a couple of kids.

16:14.720 --> 16:18.120
It has to do with the entire planet,
the universe, and who knows what all.

Why don’t you tell us
what happened that night ?

16:20.320 --> 16:23.320
This. It's all here.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.280
After seeing what I saw
that night, I rushed right home
and wrote it all down--

16:27.360 --> 16:30.880

want to forget a single detail.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.000
But I feel that
I should warn you.

I don’t want to be dramatic,
but by looking at this, you're
putting your lives in danger.

16:40.640 --> 16:46.560

- Because last night,
the weirdest thing happened.

No other object
has been misidentified...

17:09.400 --> 17:13.040
as a flying saucer more often
than the planet Venus.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.240
Really ?

17:16.359 --> 17:19.800
That was when I realized
something was weird.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.839
At which point ?

17:21.920 --> 17:24.880
Normally, if two strangers
drive into my garage,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.079
I'd tell them to get the hell off
the property, but this time I didn't.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.040
It was like
I was in a trance.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.200
- What did these men look like ?
- Usually I'm really good with faces.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.960
This time all I can remember
is how they were dressed.

17:36.040 --> 17:40.440
- They were--
- All in black ?

17:42.840 --> 17:44.800
How'd you know that ?

17:44.840 --> 17:49.000
Since the '50s, people have had
close encounters of reported
subsequent visitations...

17:49.080 --> 17:51.040
from these unearthly men
in black.

17:51.080 --> 17:55.280
[Chung's Voice] But, you know,
myths about men in black garments...

17:55.320 --> 17:59.280
have been recorded throughout history
in many different cultures.

17:59.360 --> 18:03.200
The Celtic legends are filled
with trickster men in black...

18:03.280 --> 18:07.440
and how anyone who encounters
them becomes enchanted.

18:07.520 --> 18:11.040
Unfortunately, I'm not sure the modern
reconstruction of ancient fairy tales...

18:11.120 --> 18:13.760
Lends any more credence
to Roky's testimony.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.400
Even the former leader of
your United States of America,

18:21.480 --> 18:23.600

18:23.680 --> 18:26.520
thought he saw
a U.F.O. once.

18:26.600 --> 18:30.960
But it's been proven
he only saw the planet Venus.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.360

18:35.440 --> 18:38.760
Venus was at its peak
brilliance last night.

You probably thought you saw something
up in the sky other than Venus.

18:43.680 --> 18:46.480
But I assure you,
it was Venus.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.800
I know--

18:48.840 --> 18:51.120
what I saw.

18:51.200 --> 18:56.160
Your scientists have yet to
discover how neural networks
create self-consciousness,

18:56.280 --> 19:01.680
let alone how the human brain processes
two-dimensional retinal images...

19:01.720 --> 19:06.560
into the three-dimensional
phenomenon known as perception.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.680
Yet you somehow
brazenly declare:

19:10.760 --> 19:13.160

19:15.560 --> 19:17.760
Mr. Crikenson,

19:17.800 --> 19:21.880
your scientific illiteracy
makes me shudder,

19:21.960 --> 19:24.800

flaunt your ignorance...

you saw anything last night...

other than the planet Venus.

19:31.640 --> 19:37.360
Because if you do,
you're a dead man.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.760
You can't threaten me.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.760

19:55.360 --> 19:58.920
This is what they wanted me
not to show anyone.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.320
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
I have to go pack.

where can we find you ?

aboard the hover vessel...

and was heading, not into outer space,
but into inner space,

molten core,

of the third alien,

he soon told me...

21:31.760 --> 21:34.760
was Lord Kinbote."

[Scully's Voice]
In short, Roky showed...

21:36.920 --> 21:40.240
signs of being what is known
as a fantasy prone personality.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.400
Agent Scully,
you are so kindhearted.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.440
He's a nut.
I just read his manifesto.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.840
- How did you get a copy ?
- One was sent to my publisher's.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.000
I don't know what
was most disturbing:

21:52.080 --> 21:54.040
his description of
the inner core...

21:54.120 --> 21:58.320
reincarnated souls'
sex orgy...

21:58.360 --> 22:01.560
or the fact that the whole thing
is written in screenplay format.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.600
It definitely was peculiar.

22:03.680 --> 22:05.840
Surely your partner
didn't believe any of it.

22:05.960 --> 22:09.840
Well, Mulder's had his share
of peculiar notions.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.520
He's not inclined
to dismiss anything outright.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.240
You're nuts !

22:14.320 --> 22:16.560
I'm not saying
he isn't delusional.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.280
I'm suggesting his delusional
state was triggered by something
he witnessed that night.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.720
The first part of his story
verifies the boy’s version.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.160
The only account that doesn't
add up is the girl's.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.800

- I'm going to arrange
to have her rehypnotized.

is really what she remembers.

under such conditions, she did.

had a Russian accent.

- Major Vallee is AWOL, sir.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.000
Our orders are to escort him
back to the base.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.560
The major is dead. His body is being
detained for further investigation.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.720
- Investigation into what ?
- Possible kidnapping.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.720
May we at least view the body
for verification ?

29:34.800 --> 29:36.720
I don't see why not--

29:36.800 --> 29:39.400
No, but you can talk to the other
AWOL pilot brought in with him.

29:39.480 --> 29:45.240
- Lieutenant Jack Sheaffer
is also in your custody ?
- He's right down here.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.640
Oh. He was here
just a few minutes ago.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.200
I guess he's still AWOL.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.200
You want to take
a look at Vallee ?

30:02.480 --> 30:06.040
Hmph. Guess
he's still AWOL.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.280
So what else is new ?

30:09.400 --> 30:11.800
I've got to find
that video guy.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.600
The wound is situated left
of the midline of the abdomen.

30:16.680 --> 30:22.520
- [Knocking]
- The edges of the tissue
appear to be torn apart--

30:22.600 --> 30:24.720
Who is it ?

30:24.800 --> 30:27.280

What do you think you’re doing ?

30:30.840 --> 30:34.960
- [Clicking]
- Hey, l-- Hey.

You have no right to
suppress this. Roswell ! Roswell !

30:43.320 --> 30:45.320
[ Gasps ]
No.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.040
[Man's Voice] I was unconscious for--
I don't know how long.

30:50.120 --> 30:53.480
The only reason I came to was--

30:53.560 --> 30:56.280
- Where's the tape ?
- They took it.

30:56.360 --> 31:00.000
- Who ?
- The other men in black.

31:00.080 --> 31:04.000
If I find out you lied to me,
you're a dead man.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.640
[Man's Voice]
And then he left.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.960
I never saw
any of them again.

31:11.080 --> 31:15.600
Aren’t you nervous telling
me all this after receiving
all those death threats ?

31:15.720 --> 31:21.240
I didn't spend years playing
Dungeons and Dragons and not
learn something about courage.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.520
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Hmph.

31:24.600 --> 31:28.760
[Scully's Voice] After not
recovering the tape, Mulder
was heading back to the motel.

31:28.840 --> 31:33.360
That's when his account
of things gets a little... odd.

31:33.440 --> 31:36.120
[Tires Screeching]

31:42.840 --> 31:45.040
Lieutenant Jack Sheaffer ?

31:49.680 --> 31:52.920
This is not happening.
It's not happening !

31:53.000 --> 31:55.400
This is not happening.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.360
It's not happening.
It's not happenin'.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.520
The Germans used to project the image
of the Virgin Mary...

32:03.600 --> 32:06.560
over the French trenches
in World War I.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.680
The enemy's always willing
to fire upon an invading force,

32:10.760 --> 32:14.480
but on a holy miracle ?

32:14.560 --> 32:17.560
Or on visitors
from outer space ?

32:17.640 --> 32:22.320
Yeah, the enemy sees an American
recon plane, they start shootin'.

32:22.400 --> 32:26.320
They see a flying saucer
from another galaxy,

32:26.400 --> 32:28.320
they hesitate.

32:30.400 --> 32:34.120
You know what happens to most
people after seeing a U.F.O. ?

32:34.200 --> 32:37.000
They experience
missing time.

32:37.080 --> 32:41.480
Any number of soft-option kills
will do it:

32:41.560 --> 32:45.960
nerve gas, low frequency
infra-sound beams.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.560
Hell, with
high powered microwaves,

32:49.680 --> 32:52.640
we can not only cut
enemy communications,

32:52.760 --> 32:56.080
we can cook internal organs.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.520
But abductions ?

33:00.080 --> 33:02.560
Don't know as much about 'em.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.320
I'm just the pilot.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.760
You ever flown
a flying saucer ?

33:11.080 --> 33:14.320
Afterwards, sex seems trite.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.880
But what do you do
with the abductees ?

33:16.960 --> 33:21.000
Take them back to the base.
Let the doctors work on them.

33:21.080 --> 33:25.040
Nothing physical.
They just mess with their minds.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.520
Hypnosis.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.360
At the base,
I've seen people...

33:30.440 --> 33:34.480
go into an ordinary room with
an ordinary bunch of doctors...

33:34.520 --> 33:38.720
and then come out absolutely positive
they were probed by aliens.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.520
But if abductions are just a covert
intelligence operation...

33:41.560 --> 33:47.280
and U.F.O.s are merely
secret military airships piloted
by aliens, such as yourself,

33:47.360 --> 33:49.920
then what were
you abducted by ?

33:50.000 --> 33:55.080
Don’t you get it ?
I'm absolutely positive.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.240
Me, my copilot and
those two kids were abducted !

33:59.360 --> 34:02.560
But I can't be absolutely
sure it happened.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.080
- I can't be sure of anything anymore.
- What do you mean ?

34:06.160 --> 34:09.520
I'm not sure we're
even having this conversation.

34:09.560 --> 34:13.639
I don't know if these
mashed potatoes are really here.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.880
I don't know if you even exist.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.639
I can only assure you
that I do.

34:19.719 --> 34:23.040
Well, thanks, buddy.

34:24.880 --> 34:30.080
Unfortunately, I can't give you
the same assurance about me.

34:30.199 --> 34:33.080
[Door Opens,
Footsteps Approaching]

34:33.159 --> 34:37.600
Well, looks like
I'm a dead man.

34:37.679 --> 34:39.960
Wait. It can't all be
fake memory implantation.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.960
What about that third alien ?
What was that thing ?

34:43.040 --> 34:46.560
- Who ? Lord Kinbote ?
- [Man] All right. Come on.

34:54.679 --> 34:57.000
[Chung's Voice]
That is odd.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.280
Because almost every day I was there
I ate lunch at that diner...

35:00.360 --> 35:02.520
and became dear friends
with the cook.

35:02.640 --> 35:05.960
He told me a story about the night
you're talking about.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.800
- [Chung's Voice]
A man came into his place--
- Sweet potato pie.

35:10.880 --> 35:14.480
Sat down, ordered
sweet potato pie.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.920
Identified himself
as F.B.I. Agent Mulder.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.440
He then questioned
my friend.

35:27.320 --> 35:31.000
You ever seen a U.F.O.
in these parts ?

35:31.040 --> 35:36.160
He then ordered piece after piece,
each time asking another question.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.560
You ever experienced
a period of missing time ?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.560
You ever have the suspicion
that you’ve been abducted by aliens ?

35:53.280 --> 35:56.000
Have you ever found
a metal implant in your body ?

35:57.880 --> 36:00.000
Have you checked everywhere ?

36:01.480 --> 36:04.600
He ate a whole pie
in that fashion,

36:04.680 --> 36:08.720
then got up and left.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.040
My friend never
saw him again.

36:12.160 --> 36:17.240
The cook never mentioned
Lieutenant Sheaffer, let alone
any other Air Force personnel.

36:19.160 --> 36:22.520
You seem non-nonplussed
by these contradictions.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.920
No, not after what happened
when Mulder left the diner
and got back to the motel.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.000
Scully ?

36:31.920 --> 36:34.080
Where's Scully ?

36:34.160 --> 36:37.040
Oh, she, uh, she
went to get some ice.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.160
Where is she ?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.480
What's going on ?

36:45.520 --> 36:48.520
Mulder, these gentlemen have
something important to tell you.

36:48.640 --> 36:54.280
Some alien encounters are hoaxes
perpetrated by your government
to manipulate the public.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.240
Some of these hoaxes
are intentionally revealed to
manipulate the truth seekers...

36:58.320 --> 37:03.240
who become discredited if they disclose
the deliberately absurd deception.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.840
Similar things are said
about the men in black.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.960
They purposely dress
and behave strangely,

37:08.040 --> 37:11.920
so if anyone tries to describe
an encounter with them,
they sound like a lunatic.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.840
I find no reason why anyone
would think you crazy if you
described this meeting of ours.

37:20.680 --> 37:24.240
You're feeling very sleepy,

37:24.320 --> 37:27.160

Alex Trebek ?

37:29.320 --> 37:31.280
The game show host ?

37:31.400 --> 37:36.280
Mulder didn't say
that it was Alex Trebek.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.120
It was just someone
that looked incredibly like him.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.680
Did he ? I mean,
you were there.

any recollection of this.

37:48.920 --> 37:53.320

the next morning to find
Mulder asleep in my room.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.400
Oh.

37:55.520 --> 37:59.920
But, Mulder, I don't even
remember letting you in.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.840

me in. They were already here.

Apparently that was the cause of all
those U.F. O. sightings three nights ago.

38:33.840 --> 38:38.000
They refused our assistance
because it's some kind of
top secret experimental plane.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.760
They don't want our assistance.
They want witnesses to their alibi.

the sense of closure that you want.

for respectability.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.040
the events that occurred
in any realistic vein,

because they deal with alternative
realities we’re yet to comprehend.

in the wrong context,

involved can appear foolish,

if not downright psychotic.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.960
I also know that your publishing house
is owned by Warden White, incorporated,

40:48.040 --> 40:52.320
a subsidiary of MacDougall-Kesler, which
makes me suspect a covert agenda...

of the military-industrial-
entertainment complex.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.960

this book will be written.

you can explain something to me.
