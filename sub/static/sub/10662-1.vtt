WEBVTT

00:00.043 --> 00:03.244
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.245 --> 00:04.705
Bobby, I am telling you,

00:04.707 --> 00:07.508
you could not be a professional boxer.

00:07.509 --> 00:09.844
Yes, I could, okay,
I got nothing to lose.

00:09.845 --> 00:11.512
I love belts, okay?

00:11.513 --> 00:15.416
All I miss is those thick
neck muscles and some pigeons.

00:15.417 --> 00:17.085
Bobby, no.

00:17.086 --> 00:19.520
I was too nurturing a father
for you to be a good boxer.

00:19.521 --> 00:21.723
What are you talking about, Dad?
You weren't nurturing at all.

00:21.724 --> 00:23.391
Manny Pacquiao became a champion

00:23.392 --> 00:26.060
after his father cooked
and ate his pet dog.

00:26.061 --> 00:28.496
So, yeah, I'd say I
was pretty nurturing.

00:28.497 --> 00:32.500
Whew, I saw something
today that I cannot unsee.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.836
I was at the cheap burger
place on Third Street...

00:34.837 --> 00:36.237
Cynt, where are the burgers?

00:36.238 --> 00:38.106
I am trying to tell a story here.

00:38.107 --> 00:40.441
Y'all know my best friend, Karen?

00:40.442 --> 00:42.205
Wait, wait, I thought
Sylvia was your best friend.

00:42.206 --> 00:44.045
Uh-uh, I haven't talked
to Sylvia in two years,

00:44.046 --> 00:46.547
not after she thought I
thought I was better than her.

00:46.548 --> 00:48.216
Wait, I thought you
stopped talking to Sylvia

00:48.217 --> 00:49.884
'cause you thought she thought
she was better than you.

00:49.885 --> 00:51.452
No, that's Patrice.

00:52.755 --> 00:54.255
But I remember Patrice.

00:54.256 --> 00:57.291
She actually was better than us.

00:59.094 --> 01:00.428
The point is: at the burger place,

01:00.429 --> 01:02.430
we saw Karen's husband
with another woman.

01:02.431 --> 01:06.768
Maxine, I am trying
to weave a tale here.

01:06.769 --> 01:08.102
At the burger place,

01:08.103 --> 01:10.371
we saw Karen's husband
with another woman.

01:10.372 --> 01:11.439
So wait, wait, wait.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.979
You didn't say nothing to him, Ma?

01:12.980 --> 01:13.840
You didn't let him have it?

01:13.841 --> 01:16.277
No, I got out of there before he saw me.

01:16.278 --> 01:18.579
Yeah, I had to hop in a running car.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.582
That's my girl, don't get involved.

01:21.583 --> 01:22.917
They can't blame the messenger

01:22.918 --> 01:24.452
if you don't deliver the message.

01:24.453 --> 01:26.120
Boys, your mama's no snitch.

01:26.121 --> 01:27.789
That's one of her strongest attributes.

01:27.790 --> 01:29.891
- Aah!
- Mmm! I got you!

01:29.892 --> 01:32.560
It's not snitching, it's called
being a good friend, Cynthia.

01:32.561 --> 01:34.095
You have to tell Karen.

01:34.096 --> 01:36.863
Eh, kind of sounds
like snitching, Maxine.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.299
I mean, don't you think we're getting

01:38.300 --> 01:39.367
a little ahead of ourselves here?

01:39.368 --> 01:40.635
You're telling my mom what to do

01:40.636 --> 01:43.504
without getting all of the facts first.

01:43.505 --> 01:45.640
Mom, how much money does
Karen's husband make a year?

01:45.641 --> 01:47.442
What does that have to do with anything?

01:47.443 --> 01:51.446
Eh. This is an interesting
line of questioning.

01:51.447 --> 01:54.081
Proceed.

01:55.317 --> 01:58.319
Well, uh, he does have
his own roofing company,

01:58.320 --> 02:00.655
and he did just buy her a new Mercedes,

02:00.656 --> 02:03.324
so I-I'd say it's in the six figures.

02:03.325 --> 02:04.792
Six figures, there you go.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.727
Case closed.

02:08.597 --> 02:12.266
Jerrod, just because you say
"case closed" and you do this

02:12.267 --> 02:14.602
doesn't mean you've made a point.

02:14.603 --> 02:16.604
The point is, successful people cheat.

02:16.605 --> 02:18.272
That's the reality, all right?

02:18.273 --> 02:19.941
Uh, let's break this down by income.

02:19.942 --> 02:24.645
If a man makes less than
$50,000 a year, that man...

02:28.350 --> 02:29.684
...probably faithful.

02:29.685 --> 02:32.353
But if he makes, like, 50 to 100 grand,

02:32.354 --> 02:34.355
that means he thinks about
it but he won't act on it.

02:34.356 --> 02:36.190
That's me. You got nothing
to worry about, though.

02:36.191 --> 02:37.525
What?!

02:37.526 --> 02:40.862
100 grand to half a mil means
he's definitely cheating.

02:40.863 --> 02:42.530
And then anything over
half a mil just means

02:42.531 --> 02:44.532
his wife knows his mistress by name.

02:44.533 --> 02:48.336
So like I said... case closed.

02:48.337 --> 02:50.671
He's right.

02:50.672 --> 02:53.341
Any man who gives his wife
a car with a big bow on it

02:53.342 --> 02:55.376
- is probably cheating.
- Oh.

02:55.377 --> 02:56.711
Those Lexus Christmas commercials

02:56.712 --> 02:59.013
are darker than you think.

03:16.835 --> 03:18.577
I hate having this information

03:18.578 --> 03:20.546
about Karen's husband's cheating on her,

03:20.547 --> 03:22.848
and she not knowing about it.

03:22.849 --> 03:25.390
It's like taking your
dog to be put down,

03:25.391 --> 03:28.058
and he thinking you
taking him to the park.

03:29.194 --> 03:31.595
I just don't know what to do about it.

03:31.596 --> 03:32.637
Well, if you see something,

03:32.638 --> 03:34.198
you don't always have to say something.

03:34.199 --> 03:36.824
All right, let's weigh the pros
and cons of Mom telling Karen.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.535
Con: you could ruin your friendship.

03:38.536 --> 03:41.171
Con: you could destroy a happy home.

03:41.172 --> 03:42.940
Pro...

03:45.777 --> 03:47.111
Uh, hold on, hold on, wait.

03:47.112 --> 03:48.188
I'm trying to think of a pro,

03:48.189 --> 03:50.290
but all I keep seeing
is Linda Tripp's face.

03:51.826 --> 03:54.160
Pro: you would be doing the right thing.

03:54.161 --> 03:56.463
Well, I don't want to be responsible

03:56.464 --> 03:59.232
for breaking up somebody's happy home.

03:59.233 --> 04:00.867
But how happy can the home be

04:00.868 --> 04:02.869
if this man is running
around with another woman?

04:02.870 --> 04:04.504
You guys, you should have seen this guy.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.473
It was like he had no shame.

04:06.474 --> 04:09.709
Like he was proud to have some
sexy young woman on his arm.

04:16.216 --> 04:18.517
Don't let men have this
entitled attitude, Cynthia.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.853
Do you want to live in a world

04:19.853 --> 04:22.155
where powerful men get
to do whatever they want

04:22.156 --> 04:23.256
without any consequence?

04:23.257 --> 04:25.659
Yeah, I guess so.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.162
Why can't love be like
in the books, you know?

04:29.163 --> 04:31.164
Where you meet somebody,
you fall in love,

04:31.165 --> 04:33.133
and-and... and you
live happily ever after.

04:33.134 --> 04:35.168
Because life's not a fairy tale.

04:35.169 --> 04:37.504
There's a reason fairy
tales don't have sequels.

04:37.505 --> 04:40.440
Cinderella 2 would just start
with Cinderella being like,

04:40.441 --> 04:42.108
"How come you didn't
come home last night?"

04:42.109 --> 04:43.410
And then the prince would be like,

04:43.411 --> 04:46.313
"Bitch, I rescued you from the gutter.

04:46.314 --> 04:49.683
You were making dresses
with mice when I met you."

04:49.684 --> 04:51.017
Don't listen to him.

04:51.018 --> 04:53.086
Just think about your
friendship with Karen.

04:53.087 --> 04:55.956
Well, yes, I do care about Karen,

04:55.957 --> 04:58.925
but I think telling her could
just jeopardize the friendship.

04:58.926 --> 05:01.127
I can't afford to lose another friend.

05:01.128 --> 05:04.431
I'm very opinionated, and
my experiences are limited.

05:04.432 --> 05:06.066
Yep.

05:06.067 --> 05:09.369
Once you reach 50, you're pretty
much stuck with what you got.

05:09.370 --> 05:11.671
Why do you think
Bernard's my best friend?

05:11.672 --> 05:13.707
'Cause he's alive, that's it.

05:16.177 --> 05:17.477
Look, look, Ma, I know you, okay?

05:17.478 --> 05:19.145
This is gonna eat you up inside.

05:19.146 --> 05:20.780
And your blood pressure gonna go up.

05:20.781 --> 05:22.549
And then you gonna have a stroke.

05:24.085 --> 05:27.487
And then, Ma, you'll only
be able to talk in blinks.

05:29.457 --> 05:32.092
Okay, what I think
Bobby is trying to say

05:32.093 --> 05:34.427
is, you need to be a friend to Karen.

05:34.428 --> 05:36.396
You know, don't let fear
dictate your conscience.

05:36.397 --> 05:38.698
Fine, fine, I'll call her.

05:38.699 --> 05:40.233
All right, good for you.

05:40.234 --> 05:41.234
Sisters before misters.

05:41.235 --> 05:42.902
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

05:42.903 --> 05:45.038
Please, stop talking.

05:45.039 --> 05:48.074
Whew, she is very loquacious today.

05:48.075 --> 05:49.142
Word of the day App?

05:49.143 --> 05:52.112
Yeah, and it's working very well.

05:52.113 --> 05:53.613
Oh, oh, it's ringing.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.048
As phones do.

05:55.049 --> 05:56.383
Karen?

05:56.384 --> 06:00.620
Uh, this is Cynthia,
your best friend for life.

06:00.621 --> 06:04.591
Listen, I don't know how
to put this delicately,

06:04.592 --> 06:08.862
but, um... your husband is a lying ho,

06:08.863 --> 06:10.864
and he's sleeping with another woman.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.501
What?

06:14.502 --> 06:16.136
Well, why would I make that up?

06:16.137 --> 06:18.805
Jealous?

06:18.806 --> 06:20.440
Why would I be jealous of you?

06:20.441 --> 06:22.275
Both of your sons are drug addicts.

06:23.878 --> 06:26.880
Oh, I didn't know that.

06:26.881 --> 06:29.849
Uh, oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

06:29.850 --> 06:33.153
Well, listen, honey, that's
why they call it a battle.

06:33.154 --> 06:36.456
Sometimes you win some,
sometimes you lose some.

06:38.325 --> 06:39.659
Well, fine, Miss Thing.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.928
Don't say I didn't warn you.

06:41.929 --> 06:44.035
Uh, Cynthia, I still think

06:44.036 --> 06:46.001
- that you did the right thing...
- Uh-uh, enough's enough, Maxine.

06:46.002 --> 06:47.901
Now, you come in here,

06:47.902 --> 06:51.137
planting your soapbox in
the middle of my living room,

06:51.138 --> 06:55.241
making me destroy the best
friendship I ever had this year.

06:57.445 --> 06:59.746
Are you just one of them sick people

06:59.747 --> 07:02.515
who like to see other people's pain?

07:02.516 --> 07:05.185
Bobby, quick, what's that word
from the word of the day App

07:05.186 --> 07:07.520
that perfectly explains what Maxine is?

07:07.521 --> 07:09.189
- Schadenfreude.
- Schadenfreude.

07:09.190 --> 07:13.660
That's what you are,
Maxine, a Schadenfreude.

07:15.062 --> 07:16.262
But for you, Maxine...

07:16.263 --> 07:18.264
Whoa, whoa, I am not the bad guy here.

07:18.265 --> 07:19.866
Karen's husband is.

07:19.867 --> 07:22.869
I mean, yeah, sure, but
that's not how the world works.

07:22.870 --> 07:25.371
Like, we never blame
the guy who cheated.

07:25.372 --> 07:27.140
You know, take the
Clinton situation, right?

07:27.141 --> 07:29.109
If Monica Lewinsky came in here,

07:29.110 --> 07:31.077
we'd all look at her like
she's some home-wrecker.

07:31.078 --> 07:32.412
Hillary Clinton's running for president,

07:32.413 --> 07:34.748
and we think she's weak
because she should have left.

07:34.749 --> 07:36.716
But if Bill Clinton
walked through that door,

07:36.717 --> 07:40.553
we'd all go, "Oh, my
God, it's Bill Clinton."

07:40.554 --> 07:42.889
Yeah, when it comes to cheating,
we always blame the victim.

07:42.890 --> 07:44.524
Look at Ben Affleck.

07:44.525 --> 07:48.361
He cheated with that nanny,
and we made him Batman.

07:48.362 --> 07:51.364
All right, Maxine, it's not your fault.

07:51.365 --> 07:54.033
I know.

07:54.034 --> 07:55.702
It's my fault.

07:55.703 --> 07:57.370
For listening to somebody

07:57.371 --> 08:01.107
that has no business
even discussing the topic.

08:01.108 --> 08:02.442
What are you talking about?

08:02.443 --> 08:05.145
Baby, you do not have
enough life experience.

08:05.146 --> 08:07.814
I have plenty of experience.

08:07.815 --> 08:09.783
Sure you do, pumpkin.

08:09.784 --> 08:11.317
No. No.

08:11.318 --> 08:13.319
No, you do, you have
plenty of life experience.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.322
You, uh... you took the
ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

08:16.323 --> 08:17.457
You, um...

08:17.458 --> 08:19.425
You, uh, you went to Texas that time.

08:19.426 --> 08:20.794
That was a big trip.

08:20.795 --> 08:23.463
And, uh, you know, stuff like that.

08:23.464 --> 08:25.465
Yeah, look, look, he's right, Maxine.

08:25.466 --> 08:27.433
Uh, look, uh, uh, I
was on your Instagram,

08:27.434 --> 08:30.770
and you went to Six Flags, and
you got on the Superman ride.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.405
That ride is no joke.

08:33.407 --> 08:34.774
Is this what you guys just think of me?

08:34.775 --> 08:36.075
You think I'm some sheltered kid

08:36.076 --> 08:37.744
who's never been through anything?

08:37.745 --> 08:40.013
A little bit.

08:40.014 --> 08:42.682
Well, it just so happens
that I am uniquely qualified

08:42.683 --> 08:45.418
- to give advice on exactly this topic.
- Really?

08:45.419 --> 08:47.420
Yes, I have been in a relationship

08:47.421 --> 08:49.989
that involved cheating, and
it was a lot to go through,

08:49.990 --> 08:53.326
but I ended up getting through it,

08:53.327 --> 08:54.994
and it was a great
learning experience for me.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.496
And I think that Karen
will feel the same way,

08:56.497 --> 08:58.070
- and she will thank you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:58.071 --> 08:58.915
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:58.916 --> 09:00.400
Maxine, what do you mean
you were in a relationship

09:00.401 --> 09:01.734
that involved cheating?

09:01.735 --> 09:03.770
Like, uh, you-you were cheated on?

09:03.771 --> 09:07.006
Uh, no.

09:07.942 --> 09:10.043
Are you a home-wrecker?

09:10.044 --> 09:12.579
Uh, Maxine, you cheated on someone?

09:12.580 --> 09:14.581
Uh, it was, like, a while ago.

09:14.582 --> 09:15.548
How long?

09:15.549 --> 09:17.217
Um, I don't know.

09:17.218 --> 09:21.221
It was, um... around the time I met you.

09:21.222 --> 09:23.056
Maxine, you cheated on me?!

09:23.057 --> 09:24.390
No, no, no, no, no, I didn't...

09:24.391 --> 09:26.059
I had a boyfriend when I met you,

09:26.060 --> 09:28.795
and I cheated on him with you.

09:30.064 --> 09:31.864
We did it together.

09:34.735 --> 09:36.536
As a team.

09:40.306 --> 09:41.657
So you were seeing someone

09:41.658 --> 09:43.122
at the beginning of our relationship?

09:43.123 --> 09:45.089
I'm a mistress?

09:45.090 --> 09:47.057
Maxine, I thought I
was your Jackie Kennedy.

09:47.058 --> 09:48.559
I didn't know I was your Marilyn.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.195
No, you're not my Marilyn.

09:51.196 --> 09:54.164
JFK didn't end up with Marilyn.

09:54.165 --> 09:55.799
Well, in fairness, he was assassinated

09:55.800 --> 09:58.669
before we could figure out
which direction he was headed.

09:58.670 --> 10:01.939
Jerrod, Garrett and I
were never that serious.

10:03.241 --> 10:05.576
Garrett.

10:05.577 --> 10:09.279
Garrett sounds like a dude
who owns a lot of Patagonia.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.115
Look, hey, are you okay?

10:11.116 --> 10:12.950
I mean, you look kind of mad, Jerrod.

10:12.951 --> 10:14.451
Of course he's mad, Bobby.

10:14.452 --> 10:16.624
He just found out
his live-in girlfriend

10:16.625 --> 10:19.123
is as loose as a goose.

10:19.124 --> 10:20.424
No, no, no, no.

10:20.425 --> 10:22.459
I'm not upset about Garrett, you know?

10:22.460 --> 10:24.261
I won in that situation.

10:24.262 --> 10:26.580
I'm upset, because you
could've at least told me

10:26.581 --> 10:27.397
that I was winning.

10:27.398 --> 10:28.765
What?

10:28.766 --> 10:30.934
Yeah, I mean, think about
all the fun we could've had.

10:30.935 --> 10:32.736
The-the love triangle.

10:32.737 --> 10:35.778
We sneak around and have,
like, the forbidden sex,

10:35.779 --> 10:38.180
like Kerry Washington has on Scandal.

10:39.549 --> 10:41.016
Think about all the stolen glances

10:41.017 --> 10:42.451
we missed out on, Maxine.

10:42.452 --> 10:43.752
Look, check this out.

10:49.392 --> 10:51.193
You know what I mean?

10:51.194 --> 10:52.628
You stole that glance now.

10:52.629 --> 10:54.263
Thank you.

10:54.264 --> 10:55.865
I mean, I-I was working so hard

10:55.866 --> 10:58.567
at being a good boyfriend
when I didn't have to.

10:58.568 --> 11:00.769
Doing fun stuff like
taking you go-kart racing

11:00.770 --> 11:03.772
and to the park and
pushing you on a swing.

11:03.773 --> 11:06.408
Damn, y'all fun.

11:06.409 --> 11:07.843
I was spending all this time crafting

11:07.844 --> 11:09.678
these perfect text messages to you,

11:09.679 --> 11:11.614
when all I had to send was,

11:11.615 --> 11:13.582
"Yo."

11:15.051 --> 11:16.619
"You up?

11:16.620 --> 11:17.953
He around?"

11:17.954 --> 11:20.022
You know, stuff like that.

11:20.023 --> 11:21.490
I got to hand it to you, son.

11:21.491 --> 11:22.625
You are taking this well.

11:22.626 --> 11:24.193
It's inspiring to see a relationship

11:24.194 --> 11:25.794
built on lies and mistrust.

11:25.795 --> 11:26.996
It's beautiful.

11:28.431 --> 11:30.432
Well, at least now we know Maxine

11:30.433 --> 11:33.636
has had life experiences.

11:33.637 --> 11:37.373
Nasty, dirty life experiences.

11:38.542 --> 11:40.342
And-and my son doesn't
seem to be bothered

11:40.343 --> 11:43.712
by the fact: once a cheater,

11:43.713 --> 11:47.049
always a cheater.

11:47.050 --> 11:49.385
Your son's a little
bothered by that fact.

11:49.386 --> 11:51.387
Uh, Maxine, you want to,

11:51.388 --> 11:53.688
you want to come talk to me
in the kitchen for a minute?

11:57.427 --> 12:00.963
Well, this relationship
could go either way.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.102
I think I'm gonna go pray on it.

12:08.605 --> 12:10.906
I thought Maxine was one
of the good ones, okay?

12:10.907 --> 12:14.576
She's beautiful, she's
smart, she's got nice teeth.

12:16.046 --> 12:17.813
I thought if I end up
with a girl like that,

12:17.814 --> 12:19.181
I wouldn't even have any problems.

12:19.182 --> 12:21.617
What? No, of course,
you'd have problems.

12:21.618 --> 12:23.819
- Why's that?
- I'm glad you asked me that.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.354
I got something I'm gonna show you

12:25.355 --> 12:26.956
that's gonna explain it all to you.

12:26.957 --> 12:29.224
It was inspired by a
YouTube video I saw.

12:29.225 --> 12:30.259
What?

12:30.260 --> 12:32.361
Hold on.

12:49.579 --> 12:52.047
Damn, it's lonely when you're alone.

12:52.048 --> 12:53.849
Is that you, Daddy?

12:53.850 --> 12:55.284
Now, calm down, Bobby.

12:55.285 --> 12:57.686
I wasn't gone that long.

12:57.687 --> 12:59.755
All right, now...

12:59.756 --> 13:03.225
This X-axis

13:03.226 --> 13:05.294
is self-esteem.

13:05.295 --> 13:07.863
The Y-axis represents all the problems

13:07.864 --> 13:09.832
you're gonna have in your relationship.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.567
Why do you even got a chart on this?

13:11.568 --> 13:12.968
Well, every time I think up a good idea,

13:12.969 --> 13:14.336
I like to make a chart out of it.

13:14.337 --> 13:15.445
Let me ask you something.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.986
If you're at a chef's
house and he offers you

13:16.987 --> 13:18.507
a piece of cake, are
you gonna question it?

13:18.508 --> 13:19.808
Hell no, I'm gonna eat the cake.

13:19.809 --> 13:21.110
Exactly.

13:21.111 --> 13:22.778
Well, then shut up and eat the cake.

13:22.779 --> 13:24.580
Now...

13:24.581 --> 13:27.449
a girl down here, she
ain't never gonna leave you.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.851
And she gonna put up with
just about everything,

13:28.852 --> 13:30.853
which is fine for the
first couple of weeks.

13:30.854 --> 13:32.488
But after that, you're gonna want

13:32.489 --> 13:34.490
to feel challenged to an extent.

13:34.491 --> 13:36.458
Oh, I love being
challenged to an extent.

13:36.459 --> 13:37.493
Now...

13:37.494 --> 13:39.328
a woman right up here, that's Maxine...

13:39.329 --> 13:41.196
self-esteem through the roof.

13:41.197 --> 13:42.898
Sure, she gonna make
you a better person,

13:42.899 --> 13:44.700
but, boy, is it exhausting.

13:44.701 --> 13:46.669
I hate being exhausted.

13:46.670 --> 13:47.836
Now, right here

13:47.837 --> 13:49.304
is the sweet spot.

13:49.305 --> 13:50.873
That's a seven.

13:50.874 --> 13:54.143
Just enough self-esteem so
you got morals and ethics,

13:54.144 --> 13:58.047
but not so low that they keep
crying for no reason at all.

13:58.048 --> 13:59.848
Your mama's a seven.

13:59.849 --> 14:02.284
Strong, reliable.

14:02.285 --> 14:04.153
She asks just enough questions.

14:04.154 --> 14:05.320
Honey?

14:05.321 --> 14:06.689
Yeah, Joe?

14:06.690 --> 14:08.857
About how much self-esteem
you think you got?

14:08.858 --> 14:10.559
Oh...

14:10.560 --> 14:12.161
I'm about a seven.

14:13.496 --> 14:14.997
Maybe a seven and a half,

14:14.998 --> 14:18.767
depending on how much Beyoncé
I've been listening to.

14:20.136 --> 14:22.137
Jerrod, I know this isn't ideal.

14:22.138 --> 14:24.807
And this isn't how I
wanted this to come out.

14:24.808 --> 14:26.875
Uh, I just want dates.

14:26.876 --> 14:29.344
When did you officially
break up with him?

14:29.345 --> 14:31.113
Well, I never really broke up with him

14:31.114 --> 14:33.615
as much as I phased things out.

14:33.616 --> 14:35.084
"Phased things out"?

14:35.085 --> 14:37.486
No, you phase out of a gym membership.

14:37.487 --> 14:39.354
You don't phase out of a relationship

14:39.355 --> 14:41.790
with a human being, Maxine.

14:43.126 --> 14:44.889
When did we become
official in your eyes?

14:44.890 --> 14:46.951
Well, I don't know... there's
not, like, an exact date.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.831
I guess I remember thinking

14:48.832 --> 14:50.766
this might be something serious

14:50.767 --> 14:53.969
the first time we took a walk
on the beach late at night.

14:55.505 --> 14:57.506
Of course you felt something
on a walk on a beach.

14:57.507 --> 14:59.775
Everyone feels something
on a walk on a beach.

14:59.776 --> 15:01.677
It's cliché for a reason, Maxine.

15:01.678 --> 15:04.413
But the beach was at
least our sixth date.

15:04.414 --> 15:06.148
I thought I meant
something to you by then.

15:06.149 --> 15:07.883
And you did.

15:07.884 --> 15:09.051
But you never know at the beginning

15:09.052 --> 15:10.552
what something's gonna become.

15:10.553 --> 15:11.987
I don't know.

15:11.988 --> 15:13.689
I... Just before this,

15:13.690 --> 15:15.457
it never occurred to me that you could

15:15.458 --> 15:17.192
actually cheat on me.

15:17.193 --> 15:19.294
Really?

15:20.897 --> 15:23.398
That's kind of stupid.

15:25.001 --> 15:28.137
You are a mean person.

15:28.138 --> 15:30.239
Oh, come on, Jerrod, it's so obvious.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.774
Anyone can cheat on anyone.

15:31.775 --> 15:33.575
Uh, have you really
not thought about that?

15:33.576 --> 15:35.844
I thought we were supposed to be
comforting each other right now!

15:35.845 --> 15:37.546
But it's true.

15:37.547 --> 15:39.615
I mean, aren't you the one who
likes to live in the real world?

15:39.616 --> 15:41.583
Didn't you say it yourself?

15:41.584 --> 15:44.520
You're one tax bracket
away from cheating on me?

15:44.521 --> 15:46.488
That?

15:46.489 --> 15:48.357
That's just something you say, you know?

15:48.358 --> 15:50.492
Like...

15:50.493 --> 15:52.961
It's some... it's a pla...
It's like "Bless you."

15:52.962 --> 15:56.398
Or "I know you're
gonna beat this cancer."

15:56.399 --> 15:58.033
You know, but I...

15:58.034 --> 16:00.235
I had no intention of actually going out

16:00.236 --> 16:02.237
and really cheating on you.

16:02.238 --> 16:04.506
Yeah, and neither do I.

16:04.507 --> 16:05.707
And just because I've cheated before

16:05.708 --> 16:06.942
doesn't mean I'm gonna do it again.

16:06.943 --> 16:08.010
Yeah, but how do I know that?

16:08.011 --> 16:09.278
How do I know you're not

16:09.279 --> 16:10.379
cheating on me right now?

16:10.380 --> 16:11.480
Because I'm not.

16:11.481 --> 16:12.815
Okay, I trust you.

16:12.816 --> 16:15.284
- Why?!
- What are we doing?

16:15.285 --> 16:16.685
I want you to promise me.

16:16.686 --> 16:18.220
Promise me you will never cheat on me.

16:18.221 --> 16:19.822
And promise me you'll
never break my heart

16:19.823 --> 16:22.157
the way you did poor
little Patagonia Garrett.

16:22.158 --> 16:24.026
Oh, my God, I can, I
can promise you anything.

16:24.027 --> 16:26.228
But they are just words.

16:26.229 --> 16:27.963
I mean, the possibility of cheating is,

16:27.964 --> 16:30.399
is apparent in every relationship.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.668
You can cheat on me, I can cheat on you.

16:32.669 --> 16:35.604
But I would rather take the
risk of being hurt by you

16:35.605 --> 16:39.308
than not be with you.

16:39.309 --> 16:42.244
So what you're saying

16:42.245 --> 16:45.113
is that we should use the
looming threat of cheating

16:45.114 --> 16:48.016
to keep each other
interested in each other.

16:50.053 --> 16:52.020
I don't think I said it like that.

16:52.021 --> 16:53.355
Close enough.

16:53.356 --> 16:55.490
The point is, maybe

16:55.491 --> 16:58.961
it's not love that makes
a relationship strong.

16:58.962 --> 17:01.063
It's fear.

17:03.533 --> 17:06.835
Okay, does that make
you feel good, Jerrod?

17:06.836 --> 17:08.203
Yeah, it actually does.

17:08.204 --> 17:09.838
Okay, then yes.

17:11.273 --> 17:13.942
I fear you, Jerrod.

17:13.943 --> 17:16.712
Aw, I fear you, too, Maxine.

17:16.713 --> 17:18.914
And I'm terrified that
you're gonna break my heart,

17:18.915 --> 17:21.583
you cold, cold bastard.

17:22.952 --> 17:24.252
That's weirdly the sweetest thing

17:24.253 --> 17:25.287
you've ever said to me.

17:25.288 --> 17:27.089
I know.

17:28.191 --> 17:30.158
- You kids work it out?
- Yep.

17:30.159 --> 17:31.627
We're so afraid of
cheating on each other

17:31.628 --> 17:33.197
that we'll never take
each other for granted.

17:33.198 --> 17:34.930
Yeah. Neither of us cheated today.

17:34.931 --> 17:36.632
And that's all we can ask for.

17:36.633 --> 17:39.534
Man, relationships are bleak.

17:39.535 --> 17:40.936
Now I don't understand what's going on.

17:40.937 --> 17:42.771
Is this one of these young people things

17:42.772 --> 17:45.874
like believing that Bernie
Sanders is a viable candidate?

17:47.210 --> 17:49.211
No, we're just accepting

17:49.212 --> 17:51.246
the realities of our relationship.

17:51.247 --> 17:52.748
Well, I don't get it.

17:52.749 --> 17:56.084
Are y'all swingers now?

17:56.085 --> 17:57.519
We've having a breakthrough.

17:57.520 --> 17:58.754
So yes?

17:59.822 --> 18:01.790
Oh, goodness.

18:01.791 --> 18:03.191
Oh, it's Sylvia.

18:03.192 --> 18:04.993
What does she want?

18:04.994 --> 18:07.596
Hey, Sylvia, what do you want?

18:09.098 --> 18:10.299
Karen told you that...?

18:10.300 --> 18:13.035
Oh, that woman is in denial.

18:13.036 --> 18:14.770
Listen.

18:14.771 --> 18:16.772
We need to meet and talk
about this in person.

18:16.773 --> 18:19.708
I'm gonna see you at Ruby
Tuesday's at the mall, okay?

18:19.709 --> 18:22.144
I'm on my way.

18:22.145 --> 18:25.080
Hey, Sylvia and I, we're friends again.

18:26.616 --> 18:27.916
Oh, Mama, Sylvia's back?

18:27.917 --> 18:29.818
I'm so happy for you!

18:29.819 --> 18:32.587
Uh, pick me up some of that new
chicken marsala with no peppers?

18:32.588 --> 18:34.723
Oh, Lord.

18:38.895 --> 18:41.663
Y'all try that new chicken marsala?

18:43.232 --> 18:45.100
It's good.

18:47.804 --> 18:50.864
I don't like peppers, though.

18:52.313 --> 18:53.556
You want to know how I'd cheat?

18:53.557 --> 18:55.325
Oh, yes, please regale us with how you

18:55.327 --> 18:57.677
would successfully cheat on me.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.538
You know, sarcasm never
deterred me, Maxine.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.874
I don't know why not.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.175
That's what it's there for.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.610
All right, this is what I'd do.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.312
I'd say, "Maxine,

19:07.313 --> 19:09.747
I decided to go on a camping trip."

19:09.748 --> 19:11.815
Ha! A camping trip... you know why?

19:11.816 --> 19:14.116
No cell phone reception.

19:14.117 --> 19:17.286
And it would explain why
I came back so relaxed.

19:18.589 --> 19:20.511
You know something,
yeah, camping makes sense,

19:20.512 --> 19:22.105
but you got to do
laundry right after that,

19:22.106 --> 19:23.759
so you could wash out
all the sex stains,

19:23.760 --> 19:25.127
you know what I mean?

19:25.128 --> 19:28.097
And once that stuff dry
up, it's like concrete.

19:28.098 --> 19:29.698
Oh!

19:31.401 --> 19:32.968
You know how I would cheat?

19:32.969 --> 19:35.805
I would cheat with a person
who had a terminal disease.

19:35.806 --> 19:37.740
That way my secret's
only gonna be out there

19:37.741 --> 19:39.542
for like six to eight months.

19:39.543 --> 19:41.310
Joe!

19:41.311 --> 19:43.056
Nah, I'd make it real nice.

19:43.057 --> 19:46.668
I'd take them to a game or
maybe a hot air balloon ride.

19:46.669 --> 19:48.479
And if I made it nice enough,

19:48.480 --> 19:51.613
I might be able to get
sponsored by Make-A-Wish.

19:53.450 --> 19:54.784
Well, Mom tell us about you.

19:54.785 --> 19:56.052
How would you cheat on Dad?

19:56.053 --> 19:57.453
Oh, I could never!

19:57.454 --> 19:58.242
- Mm-mm.
- Now, come on.

19:58.243 --> 19:59.547
- It's just hypothetical.
- No!

19:59.548 --> 20:01.349
- Yeah, go ahead. I want to know.
- Oh, no...

20:01.350 --> 20:04.552
Well, if you're gonna force my hand.

20:04.553 --> 20:08.590
Uh, I think maybe I'd drive to Raleigh

20:08.591 --> 20:12.288
to this nice little hotel
called The Moonlit Inn.

20:12.289 --> 20:14.724
You don't even need a
key for the elevator.

20:14.725 --> 20:16.226
You can just go straight up to your room

20:16.227 --> 20:18.328
without talking to anybody.

20:18.329 --> 20:21.231
I'd bring a couple of
wigs and some sunglasses

20:21.232 --> 20:23.333
and a different shade of makeup.

20:23.334 --> 20:26.536
See, that is the key to a good disguise.

20:26.537 --> 20:28.705
Mm-hmm, subtlety.

20:28.706 --> 20:30.974
And then I'd call Joe

20:30.975 --> 20:33.276
and I'd fill him in on how great

20:33.277 --> 20:36.679
the church retreat is going.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.649
And then I'd put my phone

20:39.650 --> 20:41.818
on airplane mode

20:41.819 --> 20:43.953
and, babe...

20:47.058 --> 20:48.825
Oh, you know, I don't know.

20:48.826 --> 20:50.760
Something like that.

20:50.761 --> 20:56.213
