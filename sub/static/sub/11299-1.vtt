No, probably not that.

- I'm not your mentee.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.542
See that? We already have that typical
mentor/mentee banter going on.

You know, like, "Don't
embarrass me in front of Marty

04:41.363 --> 04:43.492

That kind of banter.

the fact that I assigned JR

04:47.110 --> 04:48.219
to this consult, right?

04:48.220 --> 04:51.099
Of course. I just think
that without my mentorship,

04:51.100 --> 04:53.239
he may not necessarily be
in the sanctum sanctorum.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.259
Mm. You're talking about the
conference room, right?

04:55.260 --> 04:57.109

- Why don't you back off, thief.

04:57.110 --> 04:58.269
- I'm not a thief.
- Yes, you are.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.219

05:26.220 --> 05:28.339

CFO Jeannie van der Hooven

05:28.340 --> 05:30.299
- has actually...
- Wait a second, van der Hooven?

05:30.300 --> 05:32.139
- Sounds Dutch, right?
- It is Dutch.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.169
- Oh, is it?
- And totally irrelevant.

05:33.170 --> 05:34.309

- What does <i>this</i> CFO want?
- [Clyde] Sure. Okay, thinking out loud.

05:40.170 --> 05:41.349
Let's know some facts. Well...

05:41.350 --> 05:43.321
she had a kid out of wedlock,
right? Write that down.

05:43.322 --> 05:44.159
[Doug] How about this?

05:44.160 --> 05:45.269
That's true. How about this?

05:45.270 --> 05:47.189
She got her business partner
sent to federal prison.

05:47.190 --> 05:49.269
- Hilarious.
- Well, okay, so she's mean

05:49.270 --> 05:51.149
and slutty... let's write that
down, JR. Write that down.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.269
I actually heard she had a sex tape.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.625
- She does! Bing-bing-bing...
- Ooh, do you want to see it?

05:53.626 --> 05:54.678
I'll show it to you right now.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.189
These aren't quite the facts

05:56.190 --> 05:58.568

05:58.569 --> 06:00.249
- JR, please.
- Okay.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.169
Well, she hasn't really
given us an agenda,

06:02.170 --> 06:03.339
which leads me to believe
that she's fishing

06:03.340 --> 06:05.289
for us to either arrive at her pre-bake,

06:05.290 --> 06:07.269
or she wants us to give her
some kind of point of view

06:07.270 --> 06:08.339
that she hasn't yet conceived of.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.309
So I go to Davis/Dexter.
What are some assumptions

06:10.310 --> 06:12.189
we can make about what they want?

06:12.190 --> 06:14.229
Pulling from some B-school
friends who work there,

06:14.230 --> 06:16.279
I wouldn't say that the
CEO Teddy Grammatico

06:16.280 --> 06:18.289
was really looking for
much in the way of change.

06:18.290 --> 06:21.159
They've been pretty stick-in-the-mud
since Grammatico took over.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.339
Yeah, well, why would they
change? The P-and-L's

06:22.340 --> 06:23.686
- are outstanding.
- Look.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.239
Davis/Dexter is rolling in profits,

06:27.240 --> 06:29.119
and they have a solid
reputational standing

06:29.120 --> 06:31.279
of coming out of the financial
crisis without any major scars.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.239
- So why change, right?
- Nice.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.019
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Just makes me nervous, right?

06:35.020 --> 06:35.984
You know why.

06:35.985 --> 06:37.179
I mean, what's her play?

06:37.180 --> 06:38.249
What does she want from us?

06:38.250 --> 06:41.132
Corporate Jeannie is fucking terrifying.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.199
- Yeah.
- And on top of that,

06:42.200 --> 06:44.299
she knows all our "wittle" tricks. So...

06:44.300 --> 06:46.200
[exhales] Well...

06:47.170 --> 06:48.239
- I'm scared.
- Yeah.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.319
Marty, I think you're
gonna have to hold me.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.129
- Jesus, get away from me.
- Yeah. I'll just go to my new office,

06:53.130 --> 06:55.209
- 'cause if I'm in their first, it's mine.
- No, that's not true!

- Yerp! Yerp!

your early stuff, but I
feel like you went downhill

[Marty] Jeannie, seems like a bit much

07:30.737 --> 07:32.736
for a day at the office, huh?

07:32.737 --> 07:35.697

all my due diligence... I filled out

07:35.698 --> 07:37.746
all the paperwork...

07:37.747 --> 07:39.530
and starts squatting in your old office.

07:39.531 --> 07:42.740
- Wow, I am 100% not interested.
- 'Cause it's so uninteresting.

07:42.741 --> 07:45.440
I'm not done. But then I put my
foot down, and now we're sharing.

07:45.441 --> 07:46.183
- [Jeannie] Really?
- No!

07:46.184 --> 07:46.570
Yeah!

07:46.571 --> 07:47.520
Still not interested.

07:47.521 --> 07:48.520
Hey, Jeannie,

07:48.521 --> 07:50.400
where's the, uh, boyfriend?

07:50.401 --> 07:51.400
Named Mark.

07:51.401 --> 07:52.350
Eh.

07:52.351 --> 07:53.420
- Ooh...
- Mark!

07:53.421 --> 07:55.350
He works in the other complex, in R&D.

07:55.351 --> 07:56.390
[Clyde] I'm sorry, I can't
take you seriously.

07:56.391 --> 07:57.430
There's a man playing

07:57.431 --> 07:59.094
with your hair. What is this?

07:59.561 --> 08:04.440
I have to give a presentation to
500 of the pharmaceutical reps.

08:04.441 --> 08:06.194
I know it's absurd, but
they really eat it up.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.044
[Clyde] Are you serious?

08:07.045 --> 08:08.510
- I've seen these before!
- Yeah. No, no, these things are amazing.

08:08.511 --> 08:09.520
- I love these. I love these.
- Yeah.

08:09.521 --> 08:10.570
So what's gonna happen is,

08:10.571 --> 08:11.833
- we're gonna be there, right?
- Oh, yeah.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.480
- Oh, yeah. Up front.
- Just cascading singles

08:13.481 --> 08:14.510
- at your vagi...
- Yeah, they touch,

08:14.511 --> 08:16.350
- and then security kicks you out.
- No.

08:16.351 --> 08:18.400
You can stay the hell in
here and do your job.

08:18.401 --> 08:19.480
Aw, it's a show.

08:19.481 --> 08:21.359
No. We got to see it.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.370
I'm serious... you're not
allowed in the auditorium.

08:23.371 --> 08:25.380
Okay. So we've got some initial thoughts

08:25.381 --> 08:27.540
about your financials...
Uh, it's just anecdotal stuff,

08:27.541 --> 08:29.370
really, you know, uh,
soft-backed number...

08:29.371 --> 08:30.490
Marty, please just...
give it to me straight.

08:30.491 --> 08:32.530
[chuckles] Okay.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.360
Uh, Grammatico's gonna want

08:34.361 --> 08:35.490
- a stay-the-course scenario.
- Well, I want

08:35.491 --> 08:37.559
to go balls-deep in R&D.

08:37.561 --> 08:38.722
What? Why?

08:38.724 --> 08:40.549
Because that's what we <i>should</i> be doing,

08:40.549 --> 08:42.905
- even though Teddy doesn't know it yet.
- Why the fuck wouldn't you

08:42.907 --> 08:45.380
just tell us that from the start
if all you wanted us to do

08:45.381 --> 08:46.551
is rubber-stamp your agenda?

08:46.551 --> 08:48.420
Oh... 'cause I wanted to see

08:48.421 --> 08:50.410
if you could come to it on your own.

08:50.411 --> 08:51.550
- And because I can.
- [groans]

08:51.551 --> 08:54.380
I told you she'd be as much of
an asshole as any other client.

08:54.381 --> 08:56.450
- Thanks, buddy.
- Oh.

08:56.451 --> 08:59.440
So, um, I ran a spreadsheet
on all the patents

08:59.441 --> 09:00.550
running out over the next five years,

09:00.551 --> 09:02.490
and the profit-loss continuum

09:02.491 --> 09:04.390
is pretty fucked.

09:04.391 --> 09:06.340
If we continue to count
on our greatest hits...

09:06.341 --> 09:07.550
Blood pressure meds and boner pills...

09:07.551 --> 09:09.380
We're gonna drive right off a cliff.

09:09.381 --> 09:11.380
[Marty] Yeah, here's the
thing, though, Jeannie.

09:11.381 --> 09:12.470
You are saying, "Yes, yes, yes,"

09:12.471 --> 09:14.510
but your CEO is saying, "No, no, no."

09:14.511 --> 09:17.086
Well, that's 'cause he's
afraid of the board.

09:17.087 --> 09:18.529
And I'm... oh, shit!

09:18.530 --> 09:20.380
See, I'm leaking.

09:20.381 --> 09:21.430
Great. Come on.

09:21.431 --> 09:22.570
[Doug] Oh, God, I'm having a...

09:22.571 --> 09:24.460
[clears throat] ...swirl of emotions.

09:24.461 --> 09:25.550
[low chatter]

09:25.551 --> 09:27.420
[sighs] Listen,

09:27.421 --> 09:29.500
I really need you guys to
back me up on this, Marty.

09:29.501 --> 09:31.420
Teddy thinks you're a genius.

09:31.421 --> 09:33.500
So back me into a
reverse-engineered model

09:33.501 --> 09:35.560
- that supports my move, okay?
- Hey, Jeannie.

09:35.561 --> 09:37.500
- Whoa, whoa.
- It's not up for discussion, Marty.

09:37.501 --> 09:39.470
- I really need him on my team.
- Jeannie,

09:39.471 --> 09:40.500
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

09:40.501 --> 09:41.560
I feel like you're not hearing me.

09:41.561 --> 09:43.430
- Jeannie!
- Could you just convince him...

09:43.431 --> 09:44.411
That is not our baby.

09:45.561 --> 09:47.400
Oh. Oh.

09:47.401 --> 09:48.510
Yeah, hand her off. Sorry.

09:48.511 --> 09:50.420
- That's okay.
- Sorry. [chuckles]

09:50.421 --> 09:51.500
Sorry. Yeah.

09:51.501 --> 09:54.550
That... looked a lot like our baby.

09:54.551 --> 09:56.410
Yeah, it did.

09:56.411 --> 09:58.390
Oh, I left her at home today.

09:58.391 --> 09:59.540
- She's with the nanny.
- [laughs] Oh.

09:59.541 --> 10:00.550
Well, now I got to go pump.

10:00.551 --> 10:02.430
She didn't bring her today?

10:02.431 --> 10:04.540
Yeah.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.530
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- Doug...

10:06.531 --> 10:08.470
- That's why they can't be present.
- Don't start. Do not...

10:08.471 --> 10:10.350
It's starting to make
more sense. Am I wrong?

So this Climaxicor is not a new drug?

12:31.541 --> 12:32.510
Thank you. Thank you.

12:32.511 --> 12:34.390
- Thank you so much.
- Careful with it.

12:34.391 --> 12:35.460
You're not going to need that much.

12:35.461 --> 12:37.410
- Hey. There you are. Hi.
- Hi.

12:37.411 --> 12:38.400
I was just giving Doug

12:38.401 --> 12:40.350
some pills for his erectile dysfunction.

12:40.351 --> 12:42.350
- I'm just curious, that's all.
- Oh. Hey, be careful with that.

12:42.351 --> 12:42.919
It's very powerful.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.440
Okay, thank you, Mr. Fielder.

12:44.441 --> 12:46.440
I know a little something about boners.

- And you looked hot up there.
- Was I as hot as Norm?

could be as hot as Norm.

- [Clyde] Was Norm this one?
- [Marty] The one that...

12:54.440 --> 12:55.540
Oh, yeah, then he... he...

12:57.391 --> 12:59.510

- Okay.
- Okay?

One more, one more, one more.

- [Clyde] Wow.
- [Doug] Oh.

13:14.501 --> 13:15.540

- [Clyde] Jeannie.

13:17.491 --> 13:19.733
How'd you finally end up
with such a great guy?

13:20.341 --> 13:21.900
- How'd...? I didn't hear...
- After...

13:21.901 --> 13:24.340
I'm not done with my... sentence.

13:24.341 --> 13:26.410
After being with the
greatest guy of all,

13:26.411 --> 13:28.420
Marty Kaan?

13:28.421 --> 13:29.480
You finished?

13:29.481 --> 13:30.560
You got a black baby together.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.470
And... Doug gets the office.

13:32.471 --> 13:34.460
- Really?
- No.

13:34.461 --> 13:36.284
- Yes.
- Oh. That is so unfair.

13:36.285 --> 13:37.460
[Clyde] I'm thinking of
having a black baby...

13:37.461 --> 13:38.787
[Marty] Yeah, that meant a lot.

13:40.401 --> 13:41.561
[camera clicks]

Oh, my God.

13:46.471 --> 13:48.390
Wow. Now you're really somebody.

13:48.391 --> 13:49.410
Yeah.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.461
Okay, I want you to try this.

13:53.341 --> 13:54.480
Mm-hmm.

13:54.481 --> 13:56.450
- That was good.
- [laughing]

13:56.451 --> 13:58.440
You're so lying right now.

13:58.441 --> 14:01.490
I mean, it looks good,
but is it totally vegan?

14:01.491 --> 14:03.450
Yeah, dude, it's beyond vegan.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.560
It's raw vegan.

14:04.561 --> 14:06.560
Raw vegan. What?

14:06.561 --> 14:08.530
I mean, it's awesome.

14:08.531 --> 14:10.350
You know, you're not actually living

14:10.351 --> 14:11.460
a healthy vegan lifestyle if you drink.

14:11.461 --> 14:13.340
That's interesting.

14:13.341 --> 14:15.410
Yeah, no, that's worth a discussion.

14:15.411 --> 14:16.244
Is it?

14:16.245 --> 14:18.112
Well, I think everything in moderation.

14:18.113 --> 14:19.389
No, don't, don't, don't bother.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.480
He's got the conviction
of the newly brainwashed.

14:21.481 --> 14:23.410
No, actually, straight-edge

14:23.411 --> 14:24.450
is not brainwashing, okay?

14:24.451 --> 14:26.400
It's... it's a philosophy

14:26.401 --> 14:27.430
and a lifestyle.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.340
"Don't smoke, don't drink, don't fuck.

14:29.341 --> 14:30.470
I mean, at least I can fucking think."

14:30.471 --> 14:32.460
- Wow. Right?
- Ho-kay.

14:32.461 --> 14:33.500
I mean, 'cause why quote Schopenhauer

14:33.501 --> 14:35.470
when you can quote Minor Threat.

14:35.471 --> 14:37.380
- Exactly.

14:40.561 --> 14:42.390
- Baby sis. How is she?
- [door closes]

14:42.391 --> 14:44.340
- She's good. Phew.
- Good.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.340
Time to get out of this stroller.

14:46.341 --> 14:47.460
- You can take her out.
- Hi.

14:47.461 --> 14:49.430
- Hello.
- There you go.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.992
Hi. Yes.

14:51.993 --> 14:53.459
How are you doing?

14:53.460 --> 14:54.570
[Phoebe grunting]

14:54.571 --> 14:56.470
- [giggles]
- Are you smiling

14:56.471 --> 14:57.420
or are you farting?

14:57.421 --> 14:58.510
You look hot.

14:58.511 --> 15:00.816
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.339
You look amazing.

15:02.340 --> 15:04.122
- [Roscoe making popping sounds]
- Thank you.

15:04.123 --> 15:05.351
How's the job?

15:06.123 --> 15:08.072
Um... you know.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.345
No idea. [laughs]

15:10.501 --> 15:11.440
[mouthing]

15:11.441 --> 15:13.078
It's fun.

15:13.079 --> 15:13.816
Hard.

15:13.817 --> 15:15.380
Confusing.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.460
Oh.

15:16.461 --> 15:17.500
I don't know.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.065
Um, I should get going.

15:20.066 --> 15:20.904
Come on, Jeannie.

15:20.905 --> 15:22.836
Female friendship is the new black.

15:26.371 --> 15:28.247
I will definitely think on that.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.391
But I do have reservations.

15:31.471 --> 15:33.370
For dinner. I have
reservations for dinner.

15:33.371 --> 15:34.361
Right now.

15:35.511 --> 15:37.430
[sighs] All right, I love you.

15:37.431 --> 15:38.490
- Bye-bye.
- Oh.

15:38.491 --> 15:39.550
By the time I come back, I expect her

15:39.551 --> 15:41.440
to be as cool as you, okay? Good-bye.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.920
- [Phoebe fussing]
- Okay. I can do that.

15:42.921 --> 15:44.550
- Bye, baby girl.
- Oh, kiss. Okay.

15:44.551 --> 15:46.550
- Jeannie, Jeannie.
- Yes. Marty, Marty.

15:46.551 --> 15:48.410
[Marty chuckles]

15:48.411 --> 15:50.350
- Hey.
- [quietly] What?

15:50.351 --> 15:52.410
I don't treat your
boyfriend like an asshole.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.340
Well, my boyfriend's not an asshole,

15:54.341 --> 15:56.063
- so that's the difference.
- Okay, really?

15:56.064 --> 15:58.253
So she makes a gesture of friendship

15:58.254 --> 16:00.430
and that's just traumatizing to you?

16:00.431 --> 16:02.380
Oh, my God, Klare wants to be my friend.

16:02.381 --> 16:04.550
- Really, what the...
- Sorry. She's lovely.

16:04.551 --> 16:09.510
Christ, she's a vegan chef spokesmodel?

16:09.511 --> 16:11.470
First of all, it's raw vegan.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.480
And she's an Instagram
lifestyle personality.

16:15.481 --> 16:16.520
Blech.

16:16.521 --> 16:17.541
I hope she gives good head.

16:18.971 --> 16:20.451
I'll take that as a yes.

16:21.451 --> 16:22.603
Or a no.

16:25.223 --> 16:26.399
God, you're good.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
I know.

16:27.401 --> 16:28.470
[Roscoe] You guys,
she-she... she crapped.

16:28.471 --> 16:30.340
- Whoops.
- Crap?

16:30.341 --> 16:31.480
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

16:31.481 --> 16:33.441
[Jeannie moaning]

16:37.401 --> 16:39.360
[sighs]

16:39.361 --> 16:41.381
[panting]

16:48.531 --> 16:50.501
[Mark and Jeannie laugh]

16:52.431 --> 16:54.400
Mmm.

16:54.401 --> 16:57.370
Oh, wow.

16:57.371 --> 17:00.440
Wow. [sighs] [Mark laughs]

17:00.441 --> 17:02.570
You make me dinner,

17:02.571 --> 17:08.470
you are having me do things that...

17:08.471 --> 17:11.359
some of them I've only read about.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.470
I could really get used to this.

17:13.471 --> 17:16.491
I think I might.

17:17.491 --> 17:19.520
You...

17:19.521 --> 17:21.421
Me, too.

17:22.471 --> 17:24.420
[quietly] Really?

17:24.421 --> 17:27.420
Yeah. I mean, I feel the same way.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.460
Whatever that is.

17:28.461 --> 17:31.340
Right, no, whatever... I mean, me, too.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.380
- Right?
- Yeah.

17:32.381 --> 17:34.421
Yeah. Yeah.

17:36.491 --> 17:38.400
Do you want some more wine or anything?

17:38.401 --> 17:40.550
I want some you.

17:40.551 --> 17:42.370
Yeah, the wine can wait, right?

17:42.371 --> 17:43.500
I mean, that stuff gets better with age.

17:43.501 --> 17:45.460
[groaning]

17:45.461 --> 17:46.550
Marty...

17:46.551 --> 17:50.420
Mark... y, Marky, Marky.

17:50.421 --> 17:53.440
[inhales deeply]

17:53.441 --> 17:56.425
[dog barks in distance]

17:56.426 --> 17:58.490
Did you just call me Marty?

17:58.491 --> 18:00.470
No.

18:00.471 --> 18:02.410
Did I slur?

18:02.411 --> 18:05.550
I think I'm just tired
and a little drunky.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.410
Mm. So you did or you didn't? I mean,

18:07.411 --> 18:09.510
'cause I totally get if you did. Get it.

18:09.511 --> 18:13.430
- Who... You know, I... Did you...
- Right. And it's okay.

18:13.431 --> 18:14.430
It's okay with me.

18:14.431 --> 18:15.510
Fuck, it's not okay.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.511
I did. I'm sorry. [sighs]

18:24.371 --> 18:26.390
You know, it's totally weird,

18:26.391 --> 18:28.400
and it sometimes freaks me out.

18:28.401 --> 18:29.470
God, I'm really sorry.

18:29.471 --> 18:31.370
It's okay, I accept it.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.510
I really do.

18:32.511 --> 18:33.520
I mean, people

18:33.521 --> 18:35.460
do weird shit, right?

18:35.461 --> 18:37.400
And...

18:37.401 --> 18:40.380
sometimes it's shit
that's hard to explain.

18:40.381 --> 18:43.350
I mean, for people who don't...

18:43.351 --> 18:45.350
understand it, you know,

18:45.351 --> 18:48.380
it could be unforgivable.

18:48.381 --> 18:50.520
So you call me Marty, it's, uh...

18:50.521 --> 18:51.570
s-super weird.

18:51.571 --> 18:54.400
But it's also a turn-on.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.470
You know? So does that

18:55.471 --> 18:58.540
make me weird? Am I the weird guy here?

18:58.541 --> 19:01.370
Maybe. Maybe.

19:01.371 --> 19:03.490
I don't know. I...

19:03.491 --> 19:06.550
Oh, I'm sorry. I just...
I just like your voice.

19:06.551 --> 19:09.571
Mm. You know?

19:11.401 --> 19:14.500
It's part of who you are.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.420
And you turn me on.

19:17.421 --> 19:19.390
Hey, you know, I called my, uh,

19:19.391 --> 19:21.390
third-grade teacher "Mom" once.

19:21.391 --> 19:22.520
Uh, n... and not in a purely sexual way.

19:22.521 --> 19:24.480
I'm kidding, but...

19:24.481 --> 19:26.370
she was hot.

19:26.371 --> 19:27.520
Uh, my teacher, not my mom.

19:27.521 --> 19:29.540
But my mom...

19:29.541 --> 19:31.540
was not an unattractive lady.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.500
You know,

19:33.501 --> 19:36.380
when, uh...

19:36.381 --> 19:39.350
the sun is hitting her just...

19:39.351 --> 19:42.410
[snoring]

19:42.411 --> 19:44.501
Babe?

19:46.000 --> 19:52.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:56.351 --> 19:58.540
Oh, goody, Klare's in the kitchen.

19:58.541 --> 20:00.420
[laughing]

20:00.421 --> 20:01.470
What are you making?

20:01.471 --> 20:03.440
Don't worry, I'm not gonna poison you

20:03.441 --> 20:04.540
with any cashew cheese.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.480
- Yes.
- Just coffee.

20:06.481 --> 20:07.500
Just coffee, huh?

20:07.501 --> 20:09.550
Mm-hmm.

20:09.551 --> 20:11.500
You know,

20:11.501 --> 20:14.350
there are, uh,

20:14.351 --> 20:15.520
there's better ways to wake up.

20:15.521 --> 20:17.391
Really?

20:18.421 --> 20:19.570
Really, really.

20:19.571 --> 20:22.500
Well, what about Roscoe?

20:22.501 --> 20:23.520
Roscoe?

20:23.520 --> 20:26.400
- Yeah.
- Which one is he again?

20:26.401 --> 20:27.540
No, that kid sleeps like a rock.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.391
I got to drag his ass out of bed.

20:31.471 --> 20:33.421
What about your dad?

20:35.381 --> 20:36.500
Now, he might walk in.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.550
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

20:38.551 --> 20:40.470
You're on.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.550
Tell me something good.

20:53.551 --> 20:56.450
[Marty] You're gonna love this.
Clyde, tell her something good.

20:56.451 --> 20:58.530
Sure. Hey, Jeannie, that
jacket looks amazing.

20:58.531 --> 21:00.340
- You look hot today.
- Mm,

21:00.341 --> 21:01.370
and those shoes.

21:01.371 --> 21:03.470
- How are we doing?
- Not good.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.470
Teddy Grammatico actually has
a long and well-documented

21:05.471 --> 21:07.390
history of failing upwards

21:07.391 --> 21:10.360
while lateral-passing the
blame to other shareholders.

21:10.361 --> 21:11.560
Yeah, he's a stay-the-course guy

21:11.560 --> 21:13.429
- all the way.
- Okay. I have been

21:13.431 --> 21:14.540
talking to, um,

21:14.541 --> 21:17.340
some of the influential board members.

21:17.340 --> 21:18.479
Oh... Uh, Whip Huxton.

21:18.481 --> 21:21.400
Oh, I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say not a Jew.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.984
Uh, that is a terrible idea, Jeannie.

21:22.985 --> 21:24.449
- Come on.
- Eek. No board members.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.550
[Marty] Listen, you make an end run

21:25.551 --> 21:27.470
around the CEO and go to the board,

21:27.471 --> 21:29.451
it's gonna look like you're
gunning for his job.

21:31.526 --> 21:32.499
Hello?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.560
No, I am trying to save Teddy

21:34.561 --> 21:37.470
from his own lousy business plan.

21:37.471 --> 21:39.400
If he finds out that you're talking

21:39.401 --> 21:40.490
to board members, he's going to shit

21:40.491 --> 21:42.081
his bespoke pant...

21:42.082 --> 21:44.369
Oh, it's the Kaan and
Associates Dream Team.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.450
Hey, Teddy, how you doing?

21:45.451 --> 21:47.088
- How's it going?
- Very good.

21:47.089 --> 21:49.400
Figuring out a way for Jeannie
to make us even more money?

21:49.401 --> 21:51.470
That is exactly what we were
doing when you walked in.

21:51.471 --> 21:53.400
And if I may say, sir,
we are crushing it.

21:53.401 --> 21:54.480
Absolutely crushing it, so...

21:54.481 --> 21:55.857
I don't know who you are.

21:55.858 --> 21:57.440
Forgive me, sir. Doug Guggenheim. Yeah.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.520
You know what, let me
just jump in and, uh,

21:58.521 --> 22:00.450
spin Davis/Dexter's journey
line the way I see it,

22:00.451 --> 22:01.788
and I think that's gonna
shed some light on...

22:01.789 --> 22:02.489
Marty, I want you

22:02.490 --> 22:04.470
to know it's very important
that whatever you bring in

22:04.471 --> 22:07.440
regarding financials has to
be bold-letters dazzling.

22:07.441 --> 22:09.420
This is the first outside modeling

22:09.421 --> 22:10.570
the board will have
seen since I took over

22:10.571 --> 22:13.370
nine months ago. Is that pretty clear?

22:13.371 --> 22:14.400
Jeannie?

22:14.401 --> 22:16.360
- Marty?
- Ye... Bold-letters dazzling.

22:16.361 --> 22:17.410
That's what we do, Teddy.

22:17.411 --> 22:18.530
- Helvetica bold.
- Doug...

22:18.531 --> 22:20.340
Or Futura.

22:20.341 --> 22:21.450
Definitely something sans serif.

22:21.451 --> 22:22.530
- I got him. I apologize.
- I have a meeting.

22:22.531 --> 22:24.420
Um, Marty, I'm thrilled you're aboard.

22:24.421 --> 22:25.450
Jeannie raves about you.

22:25.451 --> 22:27.390
- Oh, thank you, Teddy.
- Thank you.

22:27.391 --> 22:29.371
- We're gonna crush it, man.
- [phone vibrates]

22:29.978 --> 22:31.037
[sighs]

22:31.411 --> 22:33.530
Hello.

22:33.531 --> 22:35.530
Wh-Where are you?

22:35.531 --> 22:37.501
Are you armed?

22:39.381 --> 22:42.450
[sighs] Yeah, okay. Okay. Shit.

22:42.451 --> 22:44.510
Look, I'll be back as
fast as I can, okay?

22:44.511 --> 22:45.667
You guys, make this shit better.

22:45.668 --> 22:46.389
Marty.

22:46.390 --> 22:48.420
- Make it better?
- I'm unsure of what

22:48.421 --> 22:49.490
"better" means in this context, Marty.

22:49.491 --> 22:52.390
- Really?
- We'll make it better.

22:52.391 --> 22:53.877
See that? That's why
Clyde gets the office.

22:53.878 --> 22:54.993
What, for that?!

22:54.994 --> 22:56.461
I can make it better. Right hand.

23:07.461 --> 23:10.460
Skip "Fucking Shit In My
Briefcase" Galweather.

23:10.461 --> 23:13.540
Marty "Blew Up My Fucking Life" Kaan.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.501
Hey.

23:17.421 --> 23:18.510
Aw.

23:18.511 --> 23:21.420
You know Doug Guggenheim
still uses that briefcase?

23:21.421 --> 23:22.510
Well, it's a very nice briefcase.

23:22.511 --> 23:25.381
Yes. Sans shit, but yes.

23:26.957 --> 23:30.519
So, uh, called me about 14
fucking times yesterday.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.470
Is this about the Sadie Hawkins Dance?

23:32.471 --> 23:34.431
[chuckles]

23:39.371 --> 23:40.491
I want to buy you, Marty.

23:42.501 --> 23:44.540
Um, okay, let me let you in on

23:44.541 --> 23:46.520
a little nugget of reality, Skip.

23:46.521 --> 23:48.440
It's been a while since your people

23:48.441 --> 23:50.430
could, you know, buy my people.

23:50.431 --> 23:52.380
[chuckles] [grunts]

23:52.381 --> 23:53.570
Yeah, I...

23:53.570 --> 23:56.410
You know what I'm saying.
I think you knew

23:56.411 --> 23:58.440
- before you even sat down.
- Yeah.

23:58.441 --> 24:01.500
I want to buy K and A.

24:01.501 --> 24:04.450
Well, I appreciate that you
have bounced back, Skip,

24:04.451 --> 24:07.350
but I just don't think you
got the scrilla, <i>papi.</i>

24:07.351 --> 24:09.448
- I'm sorry, the what?
- The scrilla... the money.

24:09.449 --> 24:12.380
No, I-I don't... I don't
think you quite understand.

24:12.381 --> 24:14.370
I represent a consortium.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.420
The Kohl brothers.

24:15.421 --> 24:16.570
Think you might have heard of them.

24:16.571 --> 24:18.530
Uh, Hitler One and Hitler Two?

24:18.531 --> 24:20.440
Yeah, they're adorable.

24:20.441 --> 24:22.500
- Yeah. They got the, uh...
- Scrilla.

24:22.501 --> 24:24.560
- Scrilla.
- That's good, but why would I want

24:24.561 --> 24:27.510
to work with them? I mean, when
I've spent the last ten years

24:27.511 --> 24:29.520
trying to get out from under.

24:29.521 --> 24:32.380
You're a little slow on
the uptake today, Marty.

24:32.381 --> 24:33.550
No, not working with them

24:33.551 --> 24:37.450
or me or the company.
We are talking about

24:37.451 --> 24:38.955
<i>the</i> big payday.

24:38.956 --> 24:40.794
We pay you to walk

24:40.795 --> 24:43.421
the fuck away and never look back.

24:45.441 --> 24:48.530
It's the age of consolidation, Martin.

24:48.531 --> 24:51.480
I'm sure you know, the
universe... it's dying.

24:51.481 --> 24:52.528
Yeah, I do.

24:52.529 --> 24:54.520
I mean, all those
brilliant stars out there

24:54.521 --> 24:57.510
are fading away into glowing
embers. And what does that mean?

24:57.511 --> 25:00.520
In the smaller sense, you know,
in the... in the sense of our

25:00.521 --> 25:03.450
smallness, our littleness,

25:03.451 --> 25:05.490
our infinitesimality, what does it mean?

25:05.491 --> 25:09.460
It means that we've got to do
everything we can to get bigger,

25:09.461 --> 25:11.480
to huddle together in
the coming darkness,

25:11.481 --> 25:14.530
to rage against the dying of the light.

25:14.531 --> 25:16.530
That-that was it? That was the pitch?

25:16.531 --> 25:19.560
You want to buy K and A because
the universe is dying?

25:19.561 --> 25:20.713
Yeah.

25:20.714 --> 25:23.449
That, and your company is...

25:23.450 --> 25:24.650
very conveniently undervalued.

25:24.651 --> 25:25.569
Just a little. Yeah.

25:25.570 --> 25:28.430
Now-now you're getting to it.
You want a fucking deal, Skip?

25:28.431 --> 25:32.461
Well, no, my group is
willing to wildly overpay.

25:34.411 --> 25:36.570
Okay, well... I want to thank you.

25:36.571 --> 25:39.510
I do. Because I've been
thinking a lot lately about...

25:39.511 --> 25:43.490
what is me? You know, what is mine?

25:43.491 --> 25:46.450
H-How... Who the fuck am
I, you know what I mean?

25:46.451 --> 25:47.649
How do... how do I define myself?

25:47.650 --> 25:49.541
It's just coming into focus that

25:49.542 --> 25:52.972
I define myself by
motherfuckers like you.

25:52.973 --> 25:55.540
By conflict, is what I'm
saying, by opposition.

25:55.541 --> 25:58.400
By the way that I just grind

25:58.401 --> 25:59.560
on my enemies until eventually

25:59.561 --> 26:02.470
they are just dust that I walk on.

26:02.471 --> 26:03.872
[laughs]

26:03.873 --> 26:06.390
So that's me. You know?

26:06.391 --> 26:08.500
And I'm gonna get my company

26:08.501 --> 26:10.500
so pumped up,

26:10.501 --> 26:12.480
that my valuations are just jacked,

26:12.481 --> 26:15.340
and when they're that high,

26:15.341 --> 26:17.400
then, maybe, we can talk

26:17.401 --> 26:19.450
about me selling my company

26:19.451 --> 26:21.530
to a couple of fascist pricks
like the Kohl brothers

26:21.531 --> 26:24.500
and then walking the fuck away
from everything I've built.

26:24.501 --> 26:26.480
Maybe we'll do that then.

26:26.481 --> 26:28.470
So unlike you to be a whimpering

26:28.471 --> 26:31.490
little whining bitch about business.

26:31.491 --> 26:33.420
I know. I...

26:33.421 --> 26:35.350
That's usually your thing.

26:35.351 --> 26:37.531
[both laughing]

26:39.551 --> 26:41.420
I got the drinks, Marty.

26:41.421 --> 26:43.350
Great.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.440
Oh. Okay.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.350
Oh, I almost forgot. Skip?

26:48.351 --> 26:49.470
Yeah?

26:49.471 --> 26:50.873
Go fuck yourself.

26:51.858 --> 26:52.632
Back at you.
