00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.725
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
Playing)

01:19.613 --> 01:21.604
(melody fades into haunting
counterpoint melody)

01:28.188 --> 01:29.314
(shatters)

01:39.199 --> 01:41.190
(bubbling)

01:48.175 --> 01:49.699

MAN:
J‘ 'Tis the season to be jolly J‘

01:55.215 --> 01:58.309
J‘ La, la, la, la, la,
la-la, la, la J‘

02:02.856 --> 02:06.260
J‘ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly J‘

02:06.260 --> 02:09.630
J‘ La, la, la, la, la,
la-la, la, la J‘

02:09.630 --> 02:12.166
J‘ 'Tis the season to be jolly J‘

J‘ La, la, la, la, la,

02:14.668 --> 02:17.102
J‘ La, la, la, la, la... J‘

02:18.972 --> 02:20.474
(knocks on wall)

02:20.474 --> 02:21.942
Well, house like this,

02:21.942 --> 02:25.639
you've got to expect
the foundation to settle a bit.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.148
Just going to have
to do something

02:28.148 --> 02:29.983
about that one of these days.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.713
(humming "Deck the Halls")

02:33.921 --> 02:36.389
(continues humming,
then stops abruptly)

02:37.958 --> 02:40.327
Oh, dear.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.318
What a mess.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.666
(grunts)

02:45.666 --> 02:49.303
Must be those damn raccoons
again, huh?

02:49.303 --> 02:53.399
I'm going to have to put a
screen on top of that chimney.

02:55.409 --> 02:58.312
Really going to have
to shore up the foundations.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.980
Oh, well.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.608
Que sera sera.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.214
Damn.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.021
(sighs)

03:17.965 --> 03:19.967
Boiled fish again.

03:19.967 --> 03:24.233
Well... have to replace
that thermostat, that's all.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.405
Well, if it isn't one thing,
it's another, hmm?

03:30.911 --> 03:33.180
Oh, that's convenient!

03:33.180 --> 03:36.483
I've been meaning to rearrange
these books, anyway.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.352
Let's see.

03:38.352 --> 03:42.122
How should I rearrange them?

03:42.122 --> 03:43.824
By author?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.058
No.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.527
By title, hmm?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.395
(chuckling)

03:48.395 --> 03:50.697
Maybe by color, huh?

03:50.697 --> 03:52.766
(woman humming "Deck the Halls")

03:52.766 --> 03:54.835
J‘ Fa, la, la, la, la,
la-la, la, la J‘

03:54.835 --> 03:56.503
(humming continues)

03:56.503 --> 03:57.805
No.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.740
Amanda.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.441
Oh...!

04:01.441 --> 04:02.999
Damn.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.176
(growling, snarling)

04:08.749 --> 04:10.217
Dad!

04:10.217 --> 04:11.852
Merry Christmas.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.587
Amanda, you're supposed to be

04:13.587 --> 04:15.155
spending Christmas
with your mother.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.290
What's the matter?

04:16.290 --> 04:17.658
Aren't you glad to see me?

04:17.658 --> 04:19.359
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes.
Of course. Delighted.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.261
-lt's just that...
-Just what?

04:21.261 --> 04:24.798
It's just that I'm surprised
to see you-- that's all.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.967
Look, I've been having
a difficult time lately.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.970
Everything is so...
unpredictable.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.538
Well, I couldn't stand the idea

04:31.538 --> 04:33.307
of you spending Christmas
all alone.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.509
Well, I'm not really alone.

04:35.509 --> 04:39.479
I mean, l-l mean,
I don't mind really being alone.

04:39.479 --> 04:42.416
l was beginning to think
you didn't want me here.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.817
0h, honey, don't.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.619
Don't ever say that.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.321
So, smile.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.755
You're allowed to smile.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.279
Where's your Christmas spirit?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.329
I did buy a turkey.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.532
And I got the tree out,
and l decorated it.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.435
You did the tree
all by yourself?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.096
(laughs)

05:04.738 --> 05:06.039
I got to see it.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.008
Amanda! Amanda!

05:16.750 --> 05:17.951
God, what happened?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.586
Oh, oh, that?

05:19.586 --> 05:21.088
Well, you know me.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.356
You know how clumsy I am.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.524
I'm always knocking
something over.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.727
This isn't like you at all.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.395
Well, it was just a couple
of accidents--

05:28.395 --> 05:29.897
nothing to really worry about.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.732
(growling, plate shattering)

05:31.732 --> 05:32.933
Dad!

05:32.933 --> 05:34.968
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.671
It's just the foundation
settling-- that's all.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.540
Dad, there's something
seriously wrong here.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.109
No.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.844
No, I don't think so.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.846
Listen, I got an idea.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.916
Why don't I make you a nice cup
of hot chocolate, huh?

05:48.916 --> 05:51.919
Nothing cheerful as a cup
of hot chocolate, is there?

05:51.919 --> 05:53.487
Come on.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.188
Come.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.088
(whispers):
Come on.

06:02.296 --> 06:05.288
(snarling)

06:06.500 --> 06:09.936
(shrieking)

06:12.706 --> 06:14.697
(growling)

06:18.512 --> 06:20.781
-What was that?
-What was that?

06:20.781 --> 06:22.115
I told you-- it's nothing.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.850
It's just the house settling--
that's all.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.720
No, no, it...
it sounded like some animal.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.721
Look.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.989
I told you.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.223
Oh, oh, those.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.159
Those are old marks, honey.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.493
Ah, come on.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.162
Let's have that cup
of hot chocolate,

06:35.162 --> 06:36.997
and then we'll stuff the turkey.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.766
Hey, I've got something
that I was going to...

06:39.766 --> 06:42.369
I was going to deliver it
over to your mother's house.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.804
(chuckling):
Dad.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.038
Go on, open it.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.336
It's Christmas Eve--
or it will be soon.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.339
(Amanda chuckles)

06:52.479 --> 06:56.350
(gasps)
Dad, they're beautiful.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.485
They're not real, but the
jeweler says... (clicks tongue)

06:58.485 --> 07:01.655
"Only an expert
can tell the difference."

07:01.655 --> 07:02.956
Oh.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.858
Dad, I love you!

07:04.858 --> 07:06.860
(carolers singing "Angels We
Have Heard on High" outside)

07:06.860 --> 07:09.029
Hey, it's the carolers
from St. Anne's.

07:09.029 --> 07:12.532
J‘ And the mountains in reply J‘

07:12.532 --> 07:16.203
J‘ Echoing theirjoyous
strains... J‘

07:16.203 --> 07:18.038
It wouldn't be Christmas
without them, huh?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.706
-(Amanda chuckling)
-Come on.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.242
Let's go to the front door
and sing with them.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.578
-Come on.
-(chuck|ing): Okay.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.747
J‘ In Excelsis Deo J‘

07:26.747 --> 07:27.881
J‘ Glo... J‘

07:27.881 --> 07:31.418
Make them stop!
I'm losing my mind!

07:31.418 --> 07:33.453
J‘ ...0ria J‘

07:33.453 --> 07:34.755
J‘ In Excelsis Deo... J‘

07:34.755 --> 07:37.557
Lord Beelzebub, help me!

07:37.557 --> 07:39.526
Hear my plea!

07:39.526 --> 07:43.096
J‘ Angels we have heard on high J‘

07:43.096 --> 07:46.800
J‘ Sweetly singing
o'er the plains J‘

07:46.800 --> 07:50.537
-J‘ And the mountains in reply J‘
-(rumb|ing)

07:50.537 --> 07:52.869
J‘ Echoing their... J‘
(singing fades)

07:54.908 --> 07:55.909
(rumbling continues)

07:55.909 --> 07:58.776
(whips cracking)

08:02.149 --> 08:03.683
Beelzebub!

08:03.683 --> 08:05.819
My Lord, you heard me.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.356
We hear all suffering
in the depths, demon.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.558
Every sigh.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.693
Every tear.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.363
Every complaint.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.999
That's what makes it Hell.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.801
I'm honored beyond all demons.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.135
Don't be.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.205
Ijust came up here
to shut you up.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.608
All Hell is murky with the echo
of your yattering.

08:28.608 --> 08:34.214
But my Lord, this... this man,
he's... he's some kind of saint.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.849
I'll never snatch his soul.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.551
He's not a saint.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.619
He's a pickle salesman.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.956
But he'll break,
like all the rest.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.426
First, he'll admit
the presence of evil.

08:46.426 --> 08:50.664
And then he'll lose faith in
the existence of good.

08:50.664 --> 08:54.968
And next, he'll start
to question his fate

08:54.968 --> 08:58.972
and ask, "Why me?"

08:58.972 --> 09:03.743
And finally, he'll curse God.

09:03.743 --> 09:07.013
And then... he's mine.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.849
-(thunder crashing)
-Not this one.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.184
I've tried everything.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.521
I sent such lustful dreams
to his wife,

09:14.521 --> 09:17.457
till one day he walked in on her
and his best friend.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.393
-(carolers hum "Silent Night")
-And what did he do?

09:20.393 --> 09:23.897
He said, "Que sera sera."

09:23.897 --> 09:25.799
Italian.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.502
A charm against disappointment.

09:28.502 --> 09:31.571
"What Will be, Will be."

09:31.571 --> 09:35.342
Then I put his cat
in the microwave.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.343
(chuckles)

09:36.343 --> 09:37.878
My masterpiece.

09:37.878 --> 09:42.115
Fur and cat brains
all over the kitchen walls.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.185
You must try harder.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.420
Let me touch him, just once.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.455
Please.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.956
No.

09:49.956 --> 09:52.926
There are rules, demon.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.762
Even for us.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.732
A fingernail in the eye.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.902
Did you learn nothing
at the academy?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.335
(flame whooshes)

10:05.238 --> 10:07.433
Read it, Yattering.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.412
(carolers continue humming
"Silent Night")

10:12.412 --> 10:16.249
"Treaty of Job.
6522 BC.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.920
"Rule one--
'Thou shalt not touch."'

10:19.920 --> 10:22.355
And the penalty, name it.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.824
"To become a slave."

10:24.824 --> 10:26.758
Exactly so.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.034
You have your instructions.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.836
Break his pathetic
human heart.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.738
Crush his sanity.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.508
Drive him to suicide
any way you can.

10:41.508 --> 10:45.946
But don't touch.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.614
It's impossible.

10:47.614 --> 10:52.919
Do it, or suffer eternally
in his place.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.955
Oh, no. Not that.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.157
Please, it's not fair.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.960
Don't fail.

10:59.960 --> 11:05.599
Eternity is
along, long, long...

11:05.599 --> 11:07.834
long time.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.961
(thunder crashing)

11:14.474 --> 11:18.672
No, no, don't leave me.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.950
(carolers humming
"Silent Night")

11:23.950 --> 11:25.508
Make them stop!

11:26.720 --> 11:29.823
Make them shut up!

11:29.823 --> 11:31.814
(humming "Silent Night")

11:37.197 --> 11:38.965
Thank you.
That was lovely.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.168
Oh, yeah, yes, that was
very, very nice, yes.

11:42.168 --> 11:43.837
Something for the homeless?

11:43.837 --> 11:47.933
Oh, yes, yes, of course,
of course.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.578
We'll see you next year, huh?

11:51.578 --> 11:53.647
Thank you.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.449
J‘ We wish you
a merry Christmas J‘

11:56.449 --> 11:58.618
J‘ We wish
you a merry Christmas J‘

11:58.618 --> 12:00.520
J‘ We wish you
a merry Christmas J‘

12:00.520 --> 12:02.656
J‘ And a happy New Year J‘

12:02.656 --> 12:07.127
J‘ Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin J‘

12:07.127 --> 12:10.893
J‘ Good tidings at Christmas
and a happy New Year... J‘

12:12.565 --> 12:13.827
(shivers)

12:20.874 --> 12:22.676
What's that smell?

12:22.676 --> 12:25.378
Like rotten eggs.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.642
I imagine it's just the drains.

12:31.818 --> 12:35.276
I'll have a plumber in
to see about them.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.119
(grunting)

12:41.127 --> 12:42.617
There's something
alive in there!

12:46.099 --> 12:49.436
You see, Amanda,
it's probablyjust a raccoon.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.529
(turkey gobbling)

13:03.983 --> 13:05.348
(gobbling continues)

13:07.587 --> 13:09.054
(screams)

13:20.233 --> 13:21.427
(gobbling stops)

13:23.269 --> 13:25.138
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.272
See? It stopped.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.574
My God.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.175
My fault.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.010
I should have gotten
a frozen turkey.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.480
I mean, this one is...
is too fresh.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.081
Dad, this is no time for jokes.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.251
I'm sure there's a rational
explanation for everything.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.220
What, the foundation's settling?

13:40.220 --> 13:43.623
Well, maybe Santa Claus
is playing tricks this year,

13:43.623 --> 13:46.426
and he got Christmas mixed up
with Halloween.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.061
(chuckles)

13:48.061 --> 13:49.596
You look pale.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.831
Let me pour you a brandy.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.733
Why can't you be serious?

13:53.733 --> 13:55.235
This is happening now.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.805
This is not some crazy story
someone's making up.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.040
I am serious about the brandy.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.234
Dad.

14:06.179 --> 14:10.417
Look, Amanda,
the only possible explanation

14:10.417 --> 14:12.952
is too preposterous for words.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.354
You mean a poltergeist?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.356
Yes, all that stuff.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.592
Bogeymen, things that
bump in the night.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.327
But we're a modern people.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.929
We live in the 20th century.

14:22.929 --> 14:26.232
We don't believe
in bogeymen, do we?

14:26.232 --> 14:28.234
Dad, I know what I saw.

14:28.234 --> 14:31.971
That turkey was... was alive.
And now it's on the tree.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.007
There's something evil
in this place.

14:34.007 --> 14:39.245
Whatever it is, we're just going
to have to live with it.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.347
Que sera sera.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.615
Don't say that!

14:42.615 --> 14:44.851
You know, you're a lot
like your mother.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.519
Don't say that either.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.388
What do you want me to do--

14:48.388 --> 14:51.925
call the police, or an exorcist?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.927
0h, maybe I should just
let whatever's going on

14:53.927 --> 14:55.962
drive me stark raving bonkers.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.397
Would you like to see that?

14:57.397 --> 15:01.034
See the men in the white suits
come and cart me away?

15:01.034 --> 15:04.170
Look, I'm doing the only thing
that I know how,

15:04.170 --> 15:07.073
and that is to take life
as it comes.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.509
And don't lose faith
that whatever it is,

15:09.509 --> 15:12.011
it'll work out
for the best somehow.

15:12.011 --> 15:15.014
And that's Jack Polo's
philosophy of life.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.183
Now it may not be
the greatest philosophy,

15:17.183 --> 15:19.152
but it's got me through
50 years,

15:19.152 --> 15:21.017
and I'm going to stick with it.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.992
Sorry.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.827
I shouldn't have criticized you.

15:27.827 --> 15:30.029
No, it's all right.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.099
Children should criticize
their parents.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.401
It's a way of understanding
them, hmm?

15:35.401 --> 15:37.392
(Yattering snarls)

15:38.805 --> 15:41.808
Did you hear that?

15:41.808 --> 15:45.912
Yes, yes, Amanda, I heard it.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.903
(turkey gobbling)

15:52.652 --> 15:55.188
Out! Out!

15:55.188 --> 15:57.257
(grunts)

15:57.257 --> 16:01.294
No! Not her!
You leave her alone!

16:01.294 --> 16:02.195
(grunts)

16:02.195 --> 16:04.998
Show yourself!
Show yourself!

16:04.998 --> 16:07.133
-(Amanda gasps)
-Show yourself!

16:07.133 --> 16:09.536
(Jack grunting)

16:09.536 --> 16:11.905
Show yourself, damn you!

16:11.905 --> 16:14.567
(yelling)

16:22.215 --> 16:23.616
(panting)

16:23.616 --> 16:25.985
Are you okay?

16:25.985 --> 16:29.443
Yes, I'm perfectly all right.

16:31.257 --> 16:35.695
In fact, I think
I might take a walk.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.855
Dad.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.369
Do you care to join me, huh?

16:43.369 --> 16:45.360
Huh?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.812
(snarling)

17:09.696 --> 17:11.664
(snarling continues)

17:15.101 --> 17:17.296
(thunder crashing)

17:22.742 --> 17:24.277
Beelzebub.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.245
You're about to fail.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.084
But my lord, I'm so close.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.285
Fool!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.187
He's about to go
back to his wife.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.188
What?

17:35.188 --> 17:39.092
Back to an orgy
of forgiveness and compassion.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.696
And you're wasting your time
tearing up Christmas presents.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.264
|'||-|'|| stop him.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.100
Don't let him set foot
outside the door,

17:47.100 --> 17:49.135
or you've lost him.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.638
(echoing):
I want him damned!

17:51.638 --> 17:53.373
I'll drop by.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.142
And if your mom asks
me to stay, maybe I will.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.666
That'd be great.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.257
My God, we're locked in!

18:11.257 --> 18:12.724
It won't let us out!

18:18.331 --> 18:20.333
I'll tell you what--

18:20.333 --> 18:22.824
(loudly):
why don't we try the back door?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.645
Baby, come on! I got it!

18:40.186 --> 18:42.780
Damn!
Fooled by a mortal.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.714
No!

18:51.597 --> 18:53.199
Whoops.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.134
(Amanda shrieks)

18:55.134 --> 18:58.304
Now, you see what you've done?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.540
You've frightened my daughter.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.909
Now don't you ever
do that again.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.243
Hell and damnation.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.546
You hold your tongue.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.347
There's a lady present.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.550
Now, come on, come on.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.951
No tricks, you hear me?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.509
-(Yattering snarls)
-Come on. (grunts)

19:16.622 --> 19:19.358
Look, look, look.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.094
Look, look.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.129
Look what you've done
to my place, huh?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.964
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.032
What is that?

19:26.032 --> 19:29.902
Oh, it's the thing they sent
to claim my soul.

19:29.902 --> 19:34.273
He's a minor,
not terribly bright demon

19:34.273 --> 19:35.775
called the Yattering,
I believe.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.910
God, what do we do?

19:37.910 --> 19:41.080
It's now my slave,
isn't that right?

19:41.080 --> 19:43.049
YATTERING:
Yes.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.351
JACK:
Yes, what?

19:45.351 --> 19:48.321
Yes, Mr. Polo.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.756
But how?

19:49.756 --> 19:52.350
Very good, very good.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.928
He broke rule one.

19:55.928 --> 20:00.266
Mustn't touch the damned
until they're damned.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.202
So now he's mine.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.504
(laughing)

20:04.504 --> 20:06.372
How did you know?

20:06.372 --> 20:10.510
0h, didn't they tell you why
they wanted me damned so bad?

20:10.510 --> 20:12.812
My mother was a witch.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.113
Grandma?

20:14.113 --> 20:15.782
Yes.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.718
Now, you get busy
and tidy up the place.

20:18.718 --> 20:23.823
And when you're done, you can
cook us a nice Christmas dinner.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.125
Yes, master.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.294
You know, they'll never
let you into Heaven

20:28.294 --> 20:29.862
with a demon as a slave.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.364
0h, never mind that.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.465
Get to work.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.868
This place is an unholy mess.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.837
It's all right.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.106
We're safe now.

20:40.106 --> 20:43.009
Dad, isn't that true what he
just said about Heaven?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.877
Possibly, yes.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.646
But you know what
I always say...

20:46.646 --> 20:48.948
(Yattering snarls)

20:48.948 --> 20:51.450
What are you muttering
back there, Yat?

20:51.450 --> 20:54.442
What is it that I always say?

20:55.822 --> 20:57.623
Que sera sera?

20:57.623 --> 20:59.022
Right.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.695
Dad...

21:02.695 --> 21:05.164
That's what I always say.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.859
(laughing)

21:18.477 --> 21:22.281
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.817
Waiting for us to enter.

21:24.817 --> 21:28.054
Waiting to enter us.

21:28.054 --> 21:34.721
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
