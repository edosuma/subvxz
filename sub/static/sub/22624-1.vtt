WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:03.471
(thunder rumbles)

00:15.849 --> 00:19.087
-Here we go, Rick.
-And so it begins.

00:19.120 --> 00:23.591
NARRATOR: It is the beginning
of another year on Oak Island.

00:23.624 --> 00:28.396
If this isn't an Oak Island day,
I don't know what it is.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.798
NARRATOR:
But unlike previous years,

00:30.831 --> 00:35.803
this one begins with an almost
oppressive feeling of dread.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.438
Yeah, I'll tell you Rick,

00:37.471 --> 00:40.274
the island took
a beating this winter.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.276
NARRATOR:
One week ago, brothers Rick

00:42.310 --> 00:43.844
and Marty Lagina

00:43.877 --> 00:46.447
received the troubling news
that a series

00:46.480 --> 00:48.149
of harsh winter storms
have left trees

00:48.182 --> 00:49.717
and various structures

00:49.750 --> 00:53.087
on the island badly
damaged and the roads

00:53.121 --> 00:56.657
virtually washed away.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.527
In his rush to see
the damage for himself,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.562
Rick returned to
the island early

01:01.595 --> 01:06.734
and without his
brother by his side.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.237
We had a couple big nor'easters
that came through here.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.671
It's bad.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.207
We're talking extremely
violent storms.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.409
Well, there she is.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.580
I don't care what
Mother Nature has done.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.615
The island can throw
whatever it wants at us.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.616
We're not giving up.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.532
-There he is. Hey.
-Morning, Rick.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.800
NARRATOR:
As two of Oak Island's

01:39.833 --> 01:42.670
only three full-time residents,

01:42.703 --> 01:44.572
Dave Blankenship and his wife,

01:44.605 --> 01:47.508
Garnett, have been
living on the island

01:47.541 --> 01:50.244
for more than 25 years.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.613
Although they are used
to the challenges posed

01:52.646 --> 01:55.549
by the harsh winters
of the North Atlantic,

01:55.583 --> 01:58.552
they admit that this was
one of the worst

01:58.586 --> 02:00.521
they have ever encountered.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.723
Charles has told me
that Mother Nature did

02:02.756 --> 02:05.593
-some business out there.
-She took it away from us.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.595
-We have no road back there.
-Really?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.697
-No road?
-No road at all.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.266
There's nothing
there except rocks.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.367
Come on, let's go take a look.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.738
(engine starts)

02:25.513 --> 02:29.383
Just park over here, Rick.
Let's see...

02:40.728 --> 02:42.830
Wow.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.568
NARRATOR:
The South Shore Road

02:47.601 --> 02:50.371
and the area that insulated it
from the Atlantic Ocean,

02:50.404 --> 02:53.941
has been virtually
washed away and with it,

02:53.974 --> 02:57.445
any ability to reach
the Money Pit area with digging

02:57.478 --> 03:01.649
and drilling equipment.
Unless the road can be rebuilt,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.884
this year's entire
search operation

03:03.917 --> 03:09.790
looks to be over before it
even had a chance to begin.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.726
The road is gone.
It's literally gone.

03:16.564 --> 03:20.634
There is an island in the
North Atlantic where people

03:20.668 --> 03:22.936
have been looking for
an incredible treasure

03:22.970 --> 03:26.607
for more than 200 years.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.278
So far they have found
bits of gold chain,

03:30.311 --> 03:34.515
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,

03:34.548 --> 03:37.718
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

03:37.751 --> 03:43.023
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.626
And, according to legend,

03:45.659 --> 03:48.529
one more will have to die,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.698
before the treasure
can be found.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.657
(rain falling)

04:20.994 --> 04:23.331
Hey, Billy.
We could have brought you out

04:23.364 --> 04:25.499
in a little better
weather circumstances, right?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.601
There-there was worse days than
today, when you look at that.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.737
Yeah.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.805
NARRATOR: The loss
of the South Shore Road

04:31.839 --> 04:33.507
has dealt the Oak Island team

04:33.541 --> 04:37.311
a crippling blow.

04:37.345 --> 04:41.715
RICK: The power and ferocity
of the wind and the waves,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.617
to take that road
from the condition

04:43.651 --> 04:47.020
I remember it in to
the condition it currently is,

04:47.054 --> 04:49.723
I was in awe.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.594
NARRATOR: The repairs will cost
both time and money,

04:53.627 --> 04:55.563
two precious commodities

04:55.596 --> 04:58.399
that would be better applied
in this year's efforts

04:58.432 --> 05:02.603
to solve the 222-year-old
Oak Island mystery.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.538
We've gotta get this up

05:04.572 --> 05:06.607
and ready because we've
got gear scheduled to come in

05:06.640 --> 05:08.709
and we can't put them off.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.777
We'll make it passable.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.416
NARRATOR:
In just one week,

05:15.449 --> 05:19.119
major drill rigs and equipment
are scheduled to arrive.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.988
Any further delays

05:21.021 --> 05:23.757
could jeopardize this summer's
entire operation.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.459
RICK: It's not like we've
got an existing grade

05:25.493 --> 05:28.362
and we just put gravel
over it and call it a day.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.830
It, that's not gonna happen.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.099
It has to be
a complete reconstruct.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.767
And we're up against it
right now, you know.

05:33.801 --> 05:34.868
We'd like it done yesterday.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.484
NARRATOR: Taking a break from
their road repair efforts,

05:50.518 --> 05:54.455
Rick, Charles and Dave
head to the War Room.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.425
Joining them are Rick
and Marty's nephew,

05:57.458 --> 06:00.494
Peter Fornetti,
and Dave's father,

06:00.528 --> 06:03.731
veteran treasure hunter,
Dan Blankenship.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.666
It is the team's
first opportunity

06:05.699 --> 06:07.635
to update Rick's brother,

06:07.668 --> 06:14.107
Marty, on the full extent
of last winter's damage.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.810
Hey, guys!
How's it going?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.846
RICK: Well, look, here,
here's the thing.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.682
We have some seriously bad news.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.153
Okay.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.855
The beach road,

06:27.888 --> 06:32.493
it's absolutely,
completely gone.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.762
-Oh, come on.
-Really.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.998
The entire length of the road,
Marty, from the curve over.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.733
MARTY:
Wow!

06:39.767 --> 06:41.802
Can we repair it, or is it,
like, irreparable?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.672
RICK:
No, I-I think we can repair it.

06:44.705 --> 06:49.176
Problem is, the timing issue,
bringing in the geotech rig.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.744
A week from now,
we need to get

06:50.778 --> 06:53.647
some seriously
big rigs back there.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.449
-All at the same time.
-All at the same time.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.085
-Let's make hole! -NARRATOR:
Last year, Rick,

06:58.118 --> 07:01.989
Marty and the team
invested more than $2 million

07:02.022 --> 07:04.792
drilling four
40-inch-wide shafts

07:04.825 --> 07:07.961
in an effort to locate
the original Money Pit.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.630
RICK:
What the hell is that?

07:09.663 --> 07:10.864
NARRATOR:
Although they did find

07:10.898 --> 07:12.199
incredible evidence of ancient,

07:12.232 --> 07:16.604
manmade workings more
than 160 feet below ground...

07:16.637 --> 07:18.806
What the heck is
going on down there?

07:18.839 --> 07:21.975
...the precise location of
the so-called Treasure Vault

07:22.009 --> 07:24.077
still remains a mystery.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.750
This year, the team plans
to drill an estimated

07:29.783 --> 07:35.723
40 six-inch wise bore holes
to depths of nearly 200 feet.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.259
Using last year's GAL-1 shaft
as their starting point,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.562
this method may not only

07:41.595 --> 07:43.597
help the team
pinpoint the precise location

07:43.631 --> 07:45.566
of the original Money Pit,

07:45.599 --> 07:48.969
but will also allow them
to retrieve whatever artifacts

07:49.002 --> 07:51.539
or evidence of treasure
may lie at the bottom.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.545
We find the one thing,
we get to the bottom of it.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.515
Then we commit, you know,
resources to it.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.617
With the rig scheduled
to come in,

08:03.651 --> 08:04.985
we-we don't have time

08:05.018 --> 08:06.854
to-to fool around
with that road.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.223
We've gotta get it done.
So that's priority number one.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.892
MARTY:
Well, you know what though,

08:11.925 --> 08:13.894
this could be
an opportunity couldn't it?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.663
I mean, if everything's
been moved around like that,

08:15.696 --> 08:18.131
couldn't there be an opportunity
to metal detect again?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.733
Yeah.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.069
I think the next
opportunity if you will,

08:22.102 --> 08:23.971
is to bring Gary in and,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.574
Gary Drayton and
have him metal detect.

08:26.607 --> 08:30.277
I mean, this is exactly
right up his alley.

08:30.310 --> 08:33.146
-Storm disturbance... erosion.
-Perfect.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.748
Find something.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.584
You know, you read
about that all

08:36.617 --> 08:38.852
the time where people find
some old ship or something

08:38.886 --> 08:40.253
because of a big storm.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.122
I mean, in a very
conventional sense,

08:42.155 --> 08:43.891
it could easily have
unearthed a clue.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.828
-We just have to find it.
-Right. Exactly.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.598
I viewed what Rick told me about
the devastation from the storm

08:50.631 --> 08:52.833
on the island as
a real positive.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.203
Storms like that often reveal
things that have been hidden.

08:56.236 --> 09:00.808
So, we're eager to metal detect
this new area because,

09:00.841 --> 09:03.076
you know, it could
reveal some secrets

09:03.110 --> 09:05.846
that could be very helpful
to advancing the cause here.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.815
The other thing

09:07.848 --> 09:10.017
we need to squeeze in before
the drilling starts,

09:10.050 --> 09:13.854
you know, we've done nothing
to disturb C-1 for what,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.355
seven, eight months now.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.791
So we need to put
another camera down there.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.793
You know, every year it gets
better and better, you know.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.294
New technology,

09:21.328 --> 09:24.231
cutting edge stuff and
this is cutting edge.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.667
-Hopefully we see something.
-No, that'd be great.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.669
I mean, look, we'd be,

09:28.702 --> 09:31.872
not only have same old metal
detector hits that then vanish,

09:31.905 --> 09:35.676
we never did find the shiny
gold object that a lot

09:35.709 --> 09:38.879
of experts said was real.
So, we should look.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.715
You know, there's one personal
question, if you will.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.351
I see Craig's not there.
How's he doing?

09:49.256 --> 09:52.626
Well, guys, I mean,
he's struggling of course.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.629
And his wife is
struggling and yes,

09:55.663 --> 09:57.698
you know, you can feel
his absence here right now.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.634
He would normally be sitting
right here with me, but...

10:00.668 --> 10:04.638
It's a terrible,
terrible tragedy.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.840
NARRATOR:
For the past three years,

10:06.874 --> 10:10.310
Drake Tester had become
a familiar and welcome face

10:10.343 --> 10:13.814
on Oak Island.

10:13.847 --> 10:17.317
The son of Rick and Marty's
business partner, Craig Tester,

10:17.350 --> 10:20.320
and stepbrother to Jack Begley,

10:20.353 --> 10:26.026
Drake was the youngest member
of the Oak Island team.

10:26.059 --> 10:30.998
But in March of this year,
Drake Tester died suddenly,

10:31.031 --> 10:35.302
as the result of complications
following an epileptic seizure.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.405
He was only 16 years old.

10:41.408 --> 10:45.445
It hurts me to see him
suffering with this loss.

10:45.478 --> 10:51.184
And I can't even imagine
how badly it's hurting him.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.754
The problem with something
like what happened to Craig

10:53.787 --> 10:54.955
and his family is that
you realize

10:54.988 --> 10:59.159
how-how helpless you are

10:59.192 --> 11:02.329
to-to really do anything.
I mean, you know,

11:02.362 --> 11:05.966
what-what can I say or do
to take the pain away from such

11:05.999 --> 11:07.868
a terrible loss?

11:07.901 --> 11:10.237
RICK: The Tester family has
suffered an incredible loss.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.940
I mean, words fail
in a moment like this.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.708
I'm not a parent,

11:14.742 --> 11:16.810
but I can only imagine
what they're going through.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.780
How's Jack doing?

11:19.813 --> 11:22.850
I-I guess I would
say they both are doing

11:22.883 --> 11:27.387
as well as you could expect,
given how horrible a tragedy.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.323
Well, you give them our love.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.826
I will. You know, it's
the only thing we can do.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.128
It's, you know, he has
to do this himself.

11:35.162 --> 11:40.433
But, the only thing we can
do is tell him we support him.

11:40.467 --> 11:45.773
-We're there for him. -Yes.
-Hearts go out to him.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.241
You know, I'm-I'm intending
to come out in a few days

11:48.275 --> 11:52.379
and I-I don't know where
his heart is right now.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.347
Would I like to see
him out here? Yes.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.949
He's instrumental on this team.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.985
We would, we would
not only miss Drake

11:58.018 --> 12:01.354
terribly, we'd miss Craig.
We'd miss Jack.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.024
Um, so I hope he comes.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.828
But you know what, whatever's
best for him. Period.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.997
Okay.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.933
We're-we're set on our task.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.235
We'll-we'll get as much
done as possible and-and...

12:15.268 --> 12:16.937
You know what, we should,

12:16.970 --> 12:18.872
we should get to
the bottom of this, Rick.

12:18.906 --> 12:23.210
We should find this one thing
for-for Craig and for Drake.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.512
-I like that thought.
-You'll get no argument from me.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.247
-Let's make it happen.
-MARTY: All right guys.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.982
RICK:
Okay, take care.

12:29.016 --> 12:39.492
-Take care, Marty.
-See you in a few days.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.995
NARRATOR:
While construction continues on

12:42.029 --> 12:46.333
the critically-needed
South Shore Road...

12:46.366 --> 12:48.401
Wow, look at this place!
It's ripped out.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.372
-From those storms.
-Check this out.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.573
NARRATOR:
The Laginas and their partners

12:53.606 --> 12:55.843
have invited metal detection

12:55.876 --> 13:00.113
expert Gary Drayton
back to Oak Island.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.416
Because the harsh winter
storms caused several areas

13:03.450 --> 13:06.386
of the island to suffer
significant erosion--

13:06.419 --> 13:08.455
it is hoped that
Gary will be able

13:08.488 --> 13:11.424
to turn up a number of
interesting artifacts.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.561
Artifacts which may
provide important clues

13:14.594 --> 13:18.932
that will help solve
the Oak Island mystery.

13:18.966 --> 13:22.269
-Yeah, I think we'll leave
that area till last. -Oh, yeah.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.873
And we'll just cross
this little area off.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.108
What I'm trying to do is
detect where no one else

13:28.141 --> 13:31.044
-has detected before.
-Okay.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.883
NARRATOR: Today, they will begin
their search at the area

13:35.916 --> 13:38.551
on Oak Island known
as "Isaac's Point,"

13:38.585 --> 13:43.290
located on the eastern most
part of the island.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.625
Let's just try and
grid this out.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.496
-All right.
-In some kind of pattern...

13:49.529 --> 13:52.232
Well, what I'd like
to find is some gold coins.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.401
All right.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.337
NARRATOR: With over 25 years of
experience as a professional

13:57.370 --> 13:59.506
treasure hunter,
Gary Drayton

13:59.539 --> 14:02.309
has recovered more than a
million dollars worth of

14:02.342 --> 14:04.444
surface artifacts and treasure

14:04.477 --> 14:07.881
during the course
of his career.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.217
Yeah, I'm getting a
faint little blip, here.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.953
-That was a false alarm;
let's pass on that one. -Okay.

14:12.986 --> 14:17.424
-We know that's probably iron.
-(detector beeping)

14:17.457 --> 14:20.260
Ooh! Now that's a good signal.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.328
NARRATOR:
His past collaborations

14:21.361 --> 14:23.530
with the Oak Island team

14:23.563 --> 14:26.433
have yielded a number of
significant discoveries.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.169
GARY: That is old.
It's a handmade spike.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.637
NARRATOR:
Last year,

14:30.670 --> 14:33.040
he uncovered a
large metal spike that he

14:33.073 --> 14:35.508
believes could have been used
in the construction of

14:35.542 --> 14:39.346
a 16th century
Spanish galleon.

14:39.379 --> 14:44.484
We've got a coin!
A gold coin!

14:44.517 --> 14:47.187
NARRATOR: He also discovered
a gold-plated

14:47.220 --> 14:49.456
18th century British
military button.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.459
I think it says, "plated"?

14:52.492 --> 14:57.397
GARY: If it says plated,
it's a button.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.498
(detector beeping)

14:58.531 --> 15:01.401
Sounds terrible.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.504
There's a lot of
iron around here.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.074
It's not a good sign
when it's all over.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.709
-That's not worth digging.
-Okay.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.046
-We'll see what's here.
-Yeah.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.317
NARRATOR: While Peter and Gary
continue their search...

15:17.350 --> 15:20.420
RICK: Okay, let's get this baby
in some water, see what happens.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.390
...Rick Lagina,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.258
along with island historian
Charles Barkhouse,

15:25.292 --> 15:26.960
and Dave Blankenship,

15:26.994 --> 15:28.728
meet with remote
camera specialist

15:28.761 --> 15:32.399
Jeff Christopherson in the
area of the Oak Island

15:32.432 --> 15:34.301
Money Pit known as C-1.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.736
There it is.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.505
That's the new Probert, is it?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.010
NARRATOR:
Two years ago,

15:43.043 --> 15:45.278
after drilling
an exploratory borehole...

15:45.312 --> 15:48.415
-Still dropping?
-Huge cavity!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.650
...the team obtained
video evidence of

15:50.683 --> 15:53.420
a mysterious metallic object--

15:53.453 --> 15:56.656
some 170 feet deep underground.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.490
CHARLES:
What the hell is that?

15:57.524 --> 16:01.028
RICK:
It's your gold color, David.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.429
NARRATOR:
Last summer,

16:02.462 --> 16:04.564
the Laginas returned
to the site and

16:04.597 --> 16:06.533
drilled an even larger hole--

16:06.566 --> 16:09.236
using a 40-inch wide
drilling caisson--

16:09.269 --> 16:10.603
in hopes of retrieving it.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.305
Going down.

16:12.339 --> 16:16.443
But even repeated attempts
to locate the object--

16:16.476 --> 16:18.178
with the help of
professional diver,

16:18.211 --> 16:20.347
John Chatterton--
proved unsuccessful.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.448
What're you seeing?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.726
RICK:
Given the conditions he was in,

16:33.760 --> 16:36.196
he just simply
couldn't locate it.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.532
The fact that the hole was
allowed to rest, if you will--

16:39.566 --> 16:42.602
almost nine months--
should give us a better shot,

16:42.635 --> 16:44.804
better clarity.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.706
Okay, we're looking
for several things.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.609
We're looking for the shiny,
gold thing, first and foremost,

16:49.642 --> 16:51.744
for David and for Charles.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.747
I'm looking to see
the size of the room.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.151
Hopefully the room
should be stable enough,

16:58.185 --> 17:01.221
lo these nine months,
if we see something,

17:01.254 --> 17:03.823
we can safely get a guy
back down that hole.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.426
You get this down-hole,
you get us some pictures,

17:06.459 --> 17:08.728
-we'll be enormously happy.
-All right.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.398
RICK:
Let's find that image!

17:11.431 --> 17:14.401
There are answers
to be had in C-1.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.635
We're intrigued, you know.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.605
Where is that shiny,
gold object?

17:18.638 --> 17:21.341
New technology surfaces
all the time,

17:21.374 --> 17:23.210
new camera gear.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.213
We're hoping that that can
give us a better shot,

17:26.246 --> 17:30.850
a better view of
the shiny, gold object.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.819
NARRATOR:
In an attempt

17:32.852 --> 17:35.322
to photograph every area
of the underground chamber,

17:35.355 --> 17:37.790
Jeff will be using
the Spectrum 120 camera,

17:37.824 --> 17:43.330
which can offer a 360-degree
view of underwater environments

17:43.363 --> 17:48.235
to depths of up to 1000 feet.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.707
Okay, I think I heard it splash.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.876
Oh, it's in the water now.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.646
NARRATOR: With combined
optical and digital zoom,

17:59.679 --> 18:04.451
it can also enlarge objects up
to 120 times their actual size.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.854
I'll keep it going
down at steady rate.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.522
Let me know when you
see anything of interest.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.623
Okay.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.604
-How're we looking?
-Still wall.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.610
Be 167 feet when you see
the end of the pipe.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.480
Yeah.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.648
JEFF: We should encounter the
end of that caisson pretty soon.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.223
NARRATOR:
To prevent the mysterious,

18:43.256 --> 18:45.658
underground cavity
from collapsing,

18:45.692 --> 18:48.561
the drilling caisson was
anchored into bedrock

18:48.595 --> 18:52.499
at a target depth of 160 feet.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.935
From there, a 39-inch
wide drill bit was used

18:55.968 --> 18:59.272
to cut through the remaining
11 feet of anhydrite stone

18:59.306 --> 19:01.241
to complete the shaft.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.913
DAVE:
We in it or out of it?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.781
RICK: There's the anhydrite
right there.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.383
CHARLES:
Yup.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.252
RICK: So, you gotta drop
down through that.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.420
Going down.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.327
RICK: I don't see your shiny,
gold thing yet, David.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.430
CHARLES:
Not yet, David.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.298
If there's the shiny thing,
you're gonna see it.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.500
The clarity is
really quite good.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.469
CHARLES:
Yeah.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.339
RICK: If there's any reflection
at all, off of any object,

19:32.372 --> 19:34.774
we're gonna see it.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.376
You know, when
the camera goes down,

19:36.409 --> 19:40.547
you know, initially,
I'm a little bit dismayed

19:40.580 --> 19:43.250
because I don't see
what we're looking for:

19:43.283 --> 19:45.918
evidence of the shiny,
gold object.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.721
And that's, again,
disappointing.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.425
Again, you may want to stop.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.462
We may be in it right now.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.330
Can't tell.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.733
CHARLES:
Yeah, there's the ledge.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.402
Wow. Look at that.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.403
JEFF:
Yeah.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.341
Is that the bottom?

20:08.375 --> 20:11.511
I see some features there.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.481
-Let's just do a 360 here.
-Okay.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.915
JEFF: Let's see if we get
anything of interest.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.454
Are we looking straight down?
Or are we looking...

20:21.488 --> 20:24.391
We're looking off
to the side, right now.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.294
RICK: The water clarity
is pretty good.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.029
DAVE: The water is clear
as hell for a change.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.333
RICK:
Right. Exactly.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.536
NARRATOR: Luckily for the
team, the silt and sediment

20:36.569 --> 20:38.838
that normally clouds
the water has had a chance

20:38.871 --> 20:42.475
to settle during
the long winter months.

20:42.509 --> 20:47.414
Even at a depth of 170 feet,
these images are the clearest

20:47.447 --> 20:51.284
ever recorded in the C-1
cavity to date.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.420
The clarity was unbelievable,

20:53.453 --> 20:55.755
and I don't know if
it's simply the fact

20:55.788 --> 20:58.858
that the hole was allowed
to rest if you will,

20:58.891 --> 21:01.628
precipitate out
almost nine months,

21:01.661 --> 21:04.063
or if it's because of
the high definition

21:04.096 --> 21:05.865
of the camera system.

21:05.898 --> 21:09.702
But I was impressed, surely,
by the clarity.

21:09.736 --> 21:13.406
Let's just have
pan around here.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.508
What I'm doing right now guys is

21:15.542 --> 21:20.279
just looking around in general
to get a feel for this cavern.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.352
I can't help but feel
like we're in a very

21:25.385 --> 21:27.420
large space here.

21:30.357 --> 21:34.461
RICK: Right now, it appears that
it's retained its integrity.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.397
So, it remains dive-able.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.535
CHARLES:
I'm encouraged that the,

21:42.569 --> 21:44.671
that the clay hasn't
blocked the cavity,

21:44.704 --> 21:49.476
but you know, we're not
seeing what we wanna see yet.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.345
I'll say "yet."
(chuckles)

21:52.379 --> 21:55.081
So, this gold item,
do we have any idea

21:55.114 --> 21:58.818
of what it appears to be--
is it round like a coin?

21:58.851 --> 22:01.454
I think when we first saw it,
we all had different eyes on it,

22:01.488 --> 22:03.790
but I think you were the
most interested in it.

22:03.823 --> 22:06.092
It does have, like,
a curve to it.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.994
You know, on one side.
And that's what,

22:08.027 --> 22:10.630
I think that's what
intrigued everyone.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.632
RICK:
My concern is that,

22:12.665 --> 22:15.768
when this caisson went down,
was it in such close proximity

22:15.802 --> 22:18.037
to this install,

22:18.070 --> 22:21.073
that it was dislodged?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.009
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the

22:23.042 --> 22:26.413
team's efforts to further
widen the hole could have

22:26.446 --> 22:28.715
dislodged the metallic object--

22:28.748 --> 22:31.684
and resulted in it being
buried under several inches

22:31.718 --> 22:34.421
of sediment and debris?

22:34.454 --> 22:37.089
CHARLES:
Are we close, you know?

22:37.123 --> 22:39.692
Is it something that may
have fell off the ceiling?

22:39.726 --> 22:41.861
Is it on the other
side of that wall?

22:41.894 --> 22:42.895
Who knows?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.831
Until, you know,

22:44.864 --> 22:46.132
we fully examine the cavity,

22:46.165 --> 22:49.736
who knows where
this is gonna go.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.705
Something I'd like
to do, very quickly,

22:52.739 --> 22:53.706
let's look down.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.046
That's the bottom.
We are...

23:00.079 --> 23:01.414
CHARLES: So, you're looking
straight down, now?

23:01.448 --> 23:02.749
Now looking straight down.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.487
RICK:
Okay, whoa, hold up a minute.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.155
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.423
JEFF:
What is that?

23:14.527 --> 23:17.997
RICK: That is,
in my opinion, manmade.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.640
RICK: Okay. Whoa!
Hold a minute. Whoa, whoa.

23:27.674 --> 23:28.941
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

23:28.975 --> 23:33.446
What the heck is that?

23:33.480 --> 23:34.981
NARRATOR:
After putting a high definition

23:35.014 --> 23:37.984
underwater camera some 170 feet

23:38.017 --> 23:41.488
down the Money Pit area
shaft known as C-1...

23:41.521 --> 23:43.523
-RICK: Stop. All stop.
-Whoa, whoa.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.726
...Rick Lagina and the Oak
Island team

23:46.759 --> 23:48.628
are astounded by the images

23:48.661 --> 23:52.499
they are looking
at on their monitor.

23:52.532 --> 23:55.735
Seeing something right here.
I'm seeing a shape there.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.203
CHARLES:
Yeah, there is a definite shape.

23:57.236 --> 24:01.207
That is, in my
opinion, manmade.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.544
-Yeah. -JEFF: Yes.
I agree, it looks like a piece

24:04.577 --> 24:07.514
of metal with another piece
of metal going through it.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.717
NARRATOR: Metal?
At the bottom of C-1?

24:10.750 --> 24:13.219
That, right there.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.822
NARRATOR: If so, could it
have some connection

24:15.855 --> 24:18.758
to the mysterious
gold object Rick Lagina

24:18.791 --> 24:21.227
and Charles Barkhouse first
photographed in the shaft,

24:21.260 --> 24:23.596
nearly two years ago?

24:23.630 --> 24:24.931
It looks metallic.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.265
GLEN:
Look how yellow that is.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.634
RICK:
It's your gold color, David.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.868
Yeah, there it is, David.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.510
RICK:
Why is it there,

24:37.544 --> 24:39.512
why is poking out of
the sediment?

24:39.546 --> 24:41.147
To me, the more
interesting thing

24:41.180 --> 24:43.816
about it is not the item itself,

24:43.850 --> 24:46.753
but the fact that it
is buried in sediment.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.055
Well, what else is
buried in the sediment?

24:49.088 --> 24:51.858
Definitely up and over.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.028
But what is it?

24:58.297 --> 25:01.734
JEFF: Hard to say what it is
or where it came from.

25:01.768 --> 25:06.539
Looks like a tangle of
little bits of steel.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.813
There's even more over
this way I thought I saw.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.291
That's interesting.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.597
Let me just zoom in on there.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.664
CHARLES:
There's something right...

25:31.698 --> 25:32.865
right in there, yeah.

25:37.036 --> 25:41.007
That looks like a bent piece
of metal or something.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.142
It looks to me like almost

25:43.175 --> 25:47.580
like a hook that had fallen
and is laying against that rock

25:47.614 --> 25:50.650
and we've got shadows indicating
that it's laying on the surface.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.852
CHARLES:
Yeah. There's the hook there.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.826
Now, you see
the shadow right there.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.694
RICK: Looks like you could
stick your finger

26:01.728 --> 26:05.698
on, right under there and pull
this thing off the wall.

26:05.732 --> 26:09.235
JEFF: There are actually a few
objects right there.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.270
Is that or is that not real?

26:11.303 --> 26:14.373
Does something protrude from
the wall, and is it metallic?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.042
Two key questions.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.778
If it is,
human beings put that there.

26:18.811 --> 26:22.014
-Can you zero in on...? This.
-Yes.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.683
I'll get you as close as I can.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.123
There's a little something
there, and it goes out...

26:31.157 --> 26:32.725
CHARLES:
A grating or something.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.133
JEFF:
There's a tangle of something.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.036
That looks almost like...

26:44.070 --> 26:47.106
what? Wire? Mesh?

26:47.139 --> 26:48.941
But you can see...

26:48.975 --> 26:52.344
go real close, you can see
the bar there-- bars or...

26:52.378 --> 26:56.315
Yeah. Where it's
kind of interwoven. Yeah.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.117
When Jeff was panning the camera

26:58.150 --> 27:02.321
around, we see this kind
of woven mesh affair,

27:02.354 --> 27:04.657
there's the hook shaped object.

27:04.691 --> 27:07.794
We're seeing what I can only
describe as a debris field.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.331
NARRATOR:
In 1861, searchers attempted

27:12.364 --> 27:13.833
to reach what they believed

27:13.866 --> 27:15.301
were two stacked
treasure chests

27:15.334 --> 27:20.372
at the bottom of the Money Pit
by digging an adjacent shaft.

27:20.406 --> 27:24.877
Unfortunately, Shaft #6--
as it came to be known--

27:24.911 --> 27:29.716
began filling with seawater
at a depth of 118 feet.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.417
Soon after,

27:31.450 --> 27:34.754
a number of thunderous
underground crashes were heard

27:34.787 --> 27:37.857
leaving workers to speculate
that the cribbing at the bottom

27:37.890 --> 27:41.427
of the Money Pit had collapsed
leaving whatever treasure

27:41.460 --> 27:44.831
that lay below now
scattered across a flooded,

27:44.864 --> 27:48.000
underground debris field.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.335
Is it possible that the chamber

27:49.368 --> 27:52.404
at the bottom of C-1
contains artifacts

27:52.438 --> 27:55.341
from that very
same debris field?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.343
RICK: We have the hook,
we have the mesh.

27:57.376 --> 28:01.981
We have... something that looks
maybe retrievable.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.084
We've got to figure out a way

28:05.117 --> 28:07.119
-to go down there
and get something. -Yeah.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.420
RICK:
At this point, to me,

28:08.454 --> 28:12.124
it's looking like
a possible dive.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.926
JEFF:
There's a lot down there.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.995
RICK: We're not giving up
on it, I guarantee that.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.429
CHARLES:
Nope.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.398
For short-term answers,

28:19.431 --> 28:22.001
this is the best
imagery we've ever had,

28:22.034 --> 28:25.504
but I'm of the opinion
that it's always best

28:25.537 --> 28:30.076
to have eyes and boots
to investigate something.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.911
Something's down there.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.448
I'm just gonna check
in with my brother,

28:36.482 --> 28:37.850
give him all the updates.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.019
(line ringing)

28:42.254 --> 28:44.156
We tried the camera--

28:44.190 --> 28:49.061
the Spectrum 120
from Inuktun in C-1.

28:49.095 --> 28:52.198
And it looks like there's
something down there.

28:52.231 --> 28:56.836
Not wood. Metal...
artifacts.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.037
Uh, some of them...

28:58.070 --> 28:59.105
There's something there.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.172
There's no question.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.442
And a bunch of somethings.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.378
You know, there's some
weird-shaped metal objects.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.315
It's hard, it's hard to put
a name to 'em because,

29:09.348 --> 29:11.050
you know, they're in the silt.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.456
No. No.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.259
It seems as though the majority,

29:20.292 --> 29:24.363
the vast majority of the objects
are outside of the hammer grab.

29:24.396 --> 29:27.333
Even you, when you see it,
you'll say, well that's,

29:27.366 --> 29:30.837
that's not something that
was thrown down that hole.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.971
But again...

29:39.445 --> 29:44.583
Right, but, in terms of how
we retrieve these objects,

29:44.616 --> 29:46.452
if there is a consensus,

29:46.485 --> 29:48.554
we should entertain bringing
Mike Huntley back.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.163
Safe travelsAll right, see ya.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.831
Yup. Bye.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.200
NARRATOR:
Will putting a diver--

30:01.233 --> 30:03.970
once again--
down the C-1 shaft--

30:04.003 --> 30:05.938
finally provide the team

30:05.972 --> 30:07.606
with the physical evidence
they've invested millions

30:07.639 --> 30:11.310
of dollars hoping to find?

30:11.343 --> 30:14.246
If so, it could answer
the questions first asked

30:14.280 --> 30:17.316
222 years ago:

30:17.349 --> 30:21.220
What is buried deep below
the surface of Oak Island?

30:21.253 --> 30:22.889
And who put it there?

30:30.529 --> 30:34.200
Later that same day, as
the critically needed repairs

30:34.233 --> 30:37.503
to the South Shore Road
near completion...

30:37.536 --> 30:40.907
-Let's try this little
clearing up here. -All right.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.375
Trying to keep
in a straight line.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.945
NARRATOR: Metal detection
expert, Gary Drayton--

30:45.978 --> 30:47.980
along with Rick
and Marty's nephew,

30:48.014 --> 30:49.916
Peter Fornetti--

30:49.949 --> 30:52.051
continue their search
for artifacts in the woods

30:52.084 --> 30:54.620
along the island's
eastern shore.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.323
(detector beeping)

30:57.356 --> 31:02.594
That don't sound bad.
That's a deep piece.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.964
-I think we should dig it.
-Okay.

31:10.069 --> 31:14.206
If I was guessing,
I'd say it's like a...

31:14.240 --> 31:16.342
there it is, it's iron.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.678
Big chunk of iron. Dang.

31:19.711 --> 31:24.083
-Ooh! That's not bad.
-Yeah. What is it?

31:24.116 --> 31:27.553
That's, like, an old ax.

31:27.586 --> 31:33.159
Wow, I think that's like
a double woodcutter's ax.

31:33.192 --> 31:35.161
-That's pretty cool.
-It is.

31:35.194 --> 31:39.165
It's probably early 1900s,
unless it's a Viking ax,

31:39.198 --> 31:40.566
and then we're making headlines.

31:40.599 --> 31:42.401
-I don't think it is.
-No.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.337
Okay, mate, let's
have a little scan,

31:45.371 --> 31:50.076
just see if there's
any other targets.

31:50.109 --> 31:53.179
-Nope. That was it.
-Nope.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.913
Let's go over here.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.522
(detector beeping)

32:08.527 --> 32:11.563
-That sounds good.
-You're sure there's one here?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.032
(detector beeping)

32:13.065 --> 32:16.435
That sounds really good.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.070
(detector whining)

32:18.104 --> 32:21.707
That's like a coin
or a button type signal.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.956
Yeah, it's out, whatever it is.

32:48.367 --> 32:54.006
Where are you?
Hopefully it's something decent.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.042
Didn't sound like a nail,
that is for sure.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.244
(beeping)

33:06.185 --> 33:08.454
-(detector beeping)
-Ooh! A coin!

33:08.487 --> 33:10.489
Wow.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.758
NARRATOR: While exploring
the storm-affected areas

33:12.791 --> 33:15.661
of Isaac's Point,
metal detection expert,

33:15.694 --> 33:17.763
Gary Drayton,
has just uncovered

33:17.796 --> 33:20.499
a potentially important find.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.735
It is a coin?
Or a button?

33:23.769 --> 33:26.138
I think that is a freaking coin.

33:30.142 --> 33:33.779
-PETER: Looks like it.
Very irregular shaped. -Yeah.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.348
Which is good.
That means it could be old.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.150
So, what do you think this is?

33:38.184 --> 33:39.451
I think that's old.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.054
-I think we're into
1700s with that. -1700s?

33:42.088 --> 33:45.124
GARY:
Good find for sure.

33:45.157 --> 33:49.728
NARRATOR: Although old coins are
frequently found on Oak Island,

33:49.761 --> 33:51.830
finding one from
the 18th century

33:51.863 --> 33:57.503
could be a significant event.
Prior to 1795--

33:57.536 --> 34:00.739
the year the original Money
Pit was first discovered--

34:00.772 --> 34:03.309
Oak Island was virtually
uninhabited--

34:03.342 --> 34:05.711
and evidence of human
activity was scarce.

34:08.780 --> 34:12.284
If the coin in Peter Fornetti's
hand can be dated to sometime

34:12.318 --> 34:14.620
before the late 1700s,

34:14.653 --> 34:16.455
it might actually
have been left there

34:16.488 --> 34:19.591
by someone who either buried
treasure on the island--

34:19.625 --> 34:23.229
or someone who came
there trying to find it.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.264
-Copper? Or bronze?
-GARY: Yeah. Copper.

34:25.297 --> 34:30.236
-PETER: Copper for sure?
-Yup, I see designs on it.

34:30.269 --> 34:32.471
On this side here,
look at all that design.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.473
-These lines right here?
-Yeah.

34:34.506 --> 34:37.343
It's either an English
or a French coin, my guess.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.681
It should clean up
enough to get,

34:42.714 --> 34:44.716
just even a little
design off of it.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.754
-Yeah. So you can date it?
-Sweet.

34:48.787 --> 34:49.855
-Brilliant.
-That's a good find.

34:49.888 --> 34:50.822
High five, mate!

34:58.664 --> 35:01.367
NARRATOR: After sending the
coin found at Isaac's Point off

35:01.400 --> 35:03.435
to be cleaned and dated...

35:03.469 --> 35:06.272
-CHARLES: Here comes Pete
with it now. -Yeah.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.375
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina, and
members of the Oak Island team,

35:09.408 --> 35:11.777
have returned to Lot 18.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.746
There they will carefully
search through the spoils

35:14.780 --> 35:16.515
for any artifacts brought up

35:16.548 --> 35:19.585
from the GAL-1 hole while it
was being dug last year.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.819
Scrape it!

35:20.852 --> 35:22.621
NARRATOR:
Spoils they didn't have time

35:22.654 --> 35:24.790
to examine before they had to
leave the island

35:24.823 --> 35:26.758
for the winter.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.594
So, the idea then, is to

35:28.627 --> 35:31.863
spread this out and go
through at shallower depths.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.465
-Yeah.
-Cover the whole thing.

35:33.499 --> 35:37.269
This is where we found
the gold-plated button.

35:37.303 --> 35:41.473
-That's our spot, right there.
-That's where GAL is.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.476
GAL number one.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.944
NARRATOR: Named after Rick
and Marty's parents,

35:45.977 --> 35:48.180
George and Ann...

35:48.214 --> 35:50.316
GAL-1 was the team's fourth

35:50.349 --> 35:53.619
and final search hole
last year.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.488
Using a 40-inch-wide
drilling caisson,

35:56.522 --> 35:59.958
it was dug down
to a depth of 160 feet--

35:59.991 --> 36:02.761
and yielded a number of
what are believed to be

36:02.794 --> 36:04.596
significant artifacts.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.232
RICK:
What do you make of that?

36:06.265 --> 36:08.367
I don't know.
That's got to get tested and,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.702
I mean, look at
all these patterns on there.

36:10.736 --> 36:14.740
We've got a coin!
It's a gold coin!

36:14.773 --> 36:16.275
Honest to God, a coin?

36:16.308 --> 36:17.876
-Out of this spoils pile?
-I think so.

36:17.909 --> 36:22.281
-It's either a coin or a button.
-I think it says "plated"?

36:22.314 --> 36:23.849
If it says plated,
it's a button.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.254
RICK:
There you go!

36:28.287 --> 36:29.855
We found some
significant items

36:29.888 --> 36:32.391
in the GAL-1 caisson.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.993
Items that may indicate that,

36:35.026 --> 36:39.598
yes, there's something
significant in the Money Pit.

36:39.631 --> 36:43.335
Think I should start warming
up for my gold dance, Rick?

36:43.369 --> 36:45.471
DAVE: Yeah, I'm ready
to see you dance.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.373
CHARLES: We want to see
the gold dance, Gary.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.707
RICK:
Go for it.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.277
(detector beeping)

36:54.346 --> 36:55.847
RICK:
We have learned,

36:55.881 --> 36:58.617
over the course of
the digging and the drilling,

36:58.650 --> 37:00.586
that we have to
investigate

37:00.619 --> 37:03.655
and look at every single piece.

37:03.689 --> 37:07.659
Every sample bag,
every spoils pile,

37:07.693 --> 37:10.228
we have to look at it
and analyze all of it.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.734
-Look who's here, Marty and
Alex. -You know what?

37:15.767 --> 37:18.337
We got two fresh diggers.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.972
MARTY: Members of the
fellowship of the dig.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.841
Hey, big brother.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.910
You weren't kidding
about the road damage.

37:24.943 --> 37:28.680
NARRATOR: Marty and Alex's
return signals that operations

37:28.714 --> 37:31.517
on the island are about
to return to normal.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.485
-Alex. -Charles.
Good to see you again.

37:33.519 --> 37:37.956
-Good to see you.
-Bittersweet, you know, with...

37:37.989 --> 37:39.858
-DAVE: What's this?
-There's Craig and Jack.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.727
Craig. Jack.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.565
Good to see you, Craig.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.367
NARRATOR: The arrival
of Craig Tester

37:48.400 --> 37:50.669
and his stepson, Jack Begley,

37:50.702 --> 37:52.070
offers a welcome--

37:52.103 --> 37:54.540
and very emotional--
surprise to Rick,

37:54.573 --> 37:57.743
Dave and the Oak Island team.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.879
The tragic loss of Craig's
son-- just weeks

38:00.912 --> 38:03.915
before he was scheduled
to return to the island--

38:03.949 --> 38:08.787
dealt a cruel blow that has
been felt by everyone.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.956
MARTY: Craig's been my
friend for 40-some years.

38:10.989 --> 38:16.928
He's suffering with a-a loss
I can't even comprehend.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.064
RICK: I was surprised
to see Craig and Jack.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.099
You know, it's--
it's almost incom...

38:21.132 --> 38:25.571
You know, it's-- it's almost
incomprehensible to understand.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.406
MARTY:
I'm glad he's here,

38:27.439 --> 38:30.409
because I'm sure this is
at least a distraction.

38:30.442 --> 38:35.381
You know, he's able to use his
considerable intellect on this.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.883
And, I think the same,
you know...

38:37.916 --> 38:42.621
the same distraction
is good for Jack.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.723
So... we're here.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.494
And we're glad you are.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.734
-(sighs) Any luck yet?
-Yeah, what did we miss so far?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.503
RICK: Well, you know,
the truth is we've got

38:57.536 --> 38:59.905
a few surprises
to show you both.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.974
-Yeah. -You know, it's a...
-Both? What about me?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.510
-Am I chopped...
-Chopped liver?

39:04.543 --> 39:06.978
Am I chopped liver over here?

39:07.012 --> 39:10.916
Well, they put that new
camera down C-1,

39:10.949 --> 39:12.984
and it's showing what we believe

39:13.018 --> 39:17.055
to be some objects
laying on the floor.

39:18.924 --> 39:22.928
Pictures were very clear,
it appears to show...

39:22.961 --> 39:24.896
-The water, the water was clear?
-Yeah, the water was clear.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.566
-All that, all that snow
globe stuff was gone? -Yeah.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.501
It looks like there's
a hook object,

39:29.535 --> 39:33.171
and then Rick picked up on this,
this kind of a woven object,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.507
kind of interweaved
laying on the floor.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.944
-How do we retrieve them?
-Diver.

39:38.977 --> 39:42.448
This is the best opportunity
we have to investigate C-1.

39:42.481 --> 39:44.983
If we task Mike Huntley
to dive,

39:45.016 --> 39:47.953
we now have a hard target.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.688
I'd just tell you, I'd
pretty much written C-1 off,

39:49.721 --> 39:51.523
I mean, you know...

39:51.557 --> 39:53.892
it just feels like other things
that have happened here,

39:53.925 --> 39:55.961
you know, the hits
that vanish, I mean--

39:55.994 --> 39:58.630
look, I'll reserve judgment,
okay? Let's go look.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.567
It's exciting, Rick,
I mean, it's great.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.469
RICK: I'm tired
of the half answers.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.737
I'm sure Marty is, too.
We're all tired of that.

40:05.771 --> 40:09.541
Eyes and boots, that's
how you get answers.

40:09.575 --> 40:10.942
-Let's go look.
-Okay.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.221
RICK: There's gonna be
some real surprises here.
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

40:23.254 --> 40:29.027
We got some high-tech gear and
real professionals coming in.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.830
NARRATOR: In the Oak Island
War Room, brothers Rick

40:31.863 --> 40:34.600
and Marty Lagina have
called a meeting

40:34.633 --> 40:36.968
in order to thoroughly
prep diver Mike Huntley

40:37.002 --> 40:40.038
before he begins his perilous

40:40.071 --> 40:42.674
180-foot-deep descent
into the dark,

40:42.708 --> 40:45.944
frigid waters of the C-1 shaft.

40:45.977 --> 40:49.781
On the agenda, of course,
is Jeff with Inuktun is...

40:49.815 --> 40:53.985
I mean the camera work,
it's a Spectrum 120 HD.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.921
High definition.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.890
-Several of us looked
at that footage. -Yeah.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.926
It was awesome, in that moment,

41:00.959 --> 41:03.995
in real time but now we can run
it through the Prohawk system

41:04.029 --> 41:05.864
and hopefully really get

41:05.897 --> 41:08.967
a good hard look at what
we're calling "the artifacts."

41:09.000 --> 41:11.169
NARRATOR: Frank Schiefelbein
is the CEO

41:11.202 --> 41:13.138
of Barnett & Associates,

41:13.171 --> 41:16.241
a company that distributes
a video enhancement program

41:16.274 --> 41:18.644
called Prohawk.

41:18.677 --> 41:23.048
This revolutionary technology
can transform soft, dark,

41:23.081 --> 41:26.084
or otherwise murky
recorded images

41:26.117 --> 41:30.088
into ones that appear
incredibly sharp and clear.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.190
Can I ask you a question
right out of the chute?

41:32.223 --> 41:33.892
You know, you see
this on TV a lot.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.661
You see on CSI type TV.

41:35.694 --> 41:39.164
You know, there's a,
there's a grainy camera

41:39.197 --> 41:41.299
that has a picture of a car
and they say "enhance that,"

41:41.332 --> 41:43.101
and they go down and then they
can see the license plate.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.804
-Is that sort of what you do?
-No.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.072
-MARTY: No, nothing like that.
-(all laughing)

41:47.105 --> 41:48.940
Okay, well, we got that cleared.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.942
That-that technology
doesn't exist.

41:50.976 --> 41:53.011
-That's baloney?
-Yeah.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.913
The police would love
to have that technology,

41:54.946 --> 41:57.315
-but it doesn't exist. -I've
been meaning to ask somebody

41:57.348 --> 41:59.751
who knew what they were talking
about forever about that.

41:59.785 --> 42:02.253
If you can work
or route your film

42:02.287 --> 42:04.222
through that Prohawk system,

42:04.255 --> 42:06.858
I think we can get a good hard
look and make an assessment of:

42:06.892 --> 42:09.895
are these things real and can
Mike go down and get them.

42:09.928 --> 42:13.699
Okay.
We're calling this the hook.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.066
If you look down in front
of this,

42:15.100 --> 42:17.002
you see there's a lot of

42:17.035 --> 42:20.205
interesting stuff poking out
of the sediments on the floor.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.807
So, here we are zooming in
on the hook.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.176
I mean,
it's hard to enhance that,

42:25.210 --> 42:27.245
I would think,
because it's pretty clear.

42:27.278 --> 42:30.882
FRANK: So, there's the enhanced.
Overlay in the center.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.284
-That's clearer. -And you can
definitely see the shadow

42:33.318 --> 42:35.053
up on the upper right.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.823
JEFF: The lighting is up
from this area.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.758
It's hitting this part
of the hook.

42:39.791 --> 42:43.962
I'm really confident that is
a thing that is standing off

42:43.995 --> 42:46.097
and away from that rock face.

42:46.131 --> 42:48.700
MARTY:
If our preliminary conclusions

42:48.734 --> 42:50.802
that there are manmade objects

42:50.836 --> 42:53.304
in C-1 turn out to be correct,

42:53.338 --> 42:55.106
one of those things
could be the one object

42:55.140 --> 42:57.776
that proves the whole
thing's true.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.778
RICK: Again, it's what you call
"the tease,

42:59.811 --> 43:01.012
the Oak Island tease."

43:01.046 --> 43:03.214
-Oh, yeah.
-And, now we're fixated on:

43:03.248 --> 43:04.950
Okay, how do we get to that?

43:04.983 --> 43:09.154
How do we, how do we
ascertain what it really is?

43:09.187 --> 43:13.925
JEFF: And that brings us to this
thing we're calling "the mesh."

43:13.959 --> 43:17.062
Look at this...
arch here, and this one,

43:17.095 --> 43:19.831
and this one here at roughly
a 90 degree to it.

43:19.865 --> 43:21.900
And another one back here.

43:21.933 --> 43:25.036
I can't-- this guy goes over,
and then under,

43:25.070 --> 43:28.206
and I can't help but come away
with the impression that,

43:28.239 --> 43:32.010
-that this is a woven object.
-It's anomalous,

43:32.043 --> 43:33.745
I mean, it doesn't
look like rock,

43:33.779 --> 43:35.981
it doesn't look like
it belongs there.

43:36.014 --> 43:37.382
It doesn't even look like
anything that could've been

43:37.415 --> 43:40.819
-introduced by us. So...
-No.

43:40.852 --> 43:43.855
JEFF: And that's what we're
calling "the shackle."

43:43.889 --> 43:46.825
I can see that this is also
casting shadows in different

43:46.858 --> 43:49.194
directions depending on
how it's illuminated.

43:49.227 --> 43:51.162
It looks like links
of a chain to me,

43:51.196 --> 43:53.098
-like an oval chain.
-You can see it,

43:53.131 --> 43:55.266
-there's an over and under
to it. Right? -Yup.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.869
NARRATOR:
A chain?

43:57.903 --> 44:01.740
In a cavern more than
170 feet below ground?

44:01.773 --> 44:03.441
Could this be evidence of
a treasure buried

44:03.474 --> 44:06.077
at the bottom of C-1?

44:06.111 --> 44:10.381
Or something ominous
and disturbing?

44:10.415 --> 44:13.051
According to area legends,

44:13.084 --> 44:15.887
after treasure was
buried on Oak Island,

44:15.921 --> 44:18.223
one of the slaves forced
to dig the booby-trapped

44:18.256 --> 44:22.427
flood tunnels was chained
to a post and left deep

44:22.460 --> 44:26.765
underground to die. It was
thought that his tortured

44:26.798 --> 44:29.801
soul would henceforth
guard the treasure--

44:29.835 --> 44:34.205
and serve as a curse to those
who attempt to find it.

44:34.239 --> 44:38.443
It's intriguing.
It's annoyingly intriguing.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.345
-(all laughing)
-Part of me goes,

44:40.378 --> 44:43.014
"How come we didn't bring up
anything with the big clam?

44:43.048 --> 44:44.249
-When we were digging it up."
-That's right.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.752
And we brought up
a ton of material,

44:46.785 --> 44:47.986
and all of this stuff was just

44:48.019 --> 44:50.021
outside of where
we were digging?

44:50.055 --> 44:51.923
That-that bothers me,
but I'm glad we're

44:51.957 --> 44:53.324
going back down there again.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.861
Especially you had the hits
from the very first time.

44:55.894 --> 44:56.895
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

45:04.936 --> 45:08.940
NARRATOR: One year ago while
investigating the C-1 chamber,

45:08.974 --> 45:12.143
Mike Huntley obtained a number
of hits with a metal detector.

45:12.177 --> 45:13.311
He's got something on
the metal detector.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.487
All stop.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.123
NARRATOR: But then the hits
on the metal detector

45:25.156 --> 45:27.025
mysteriously disappeared.

45:30.128 --> 45:33.164
Maybe that's what they were.
We just never found them, so...

45:33.198 --> 45:35.166
I mean, we've all been
fascinated by the shiny

45:35.200 --> 45:37.402
gold object in C-1.

45:37.435 --> 45:40.138
So, uh, we're gonna revisit that
footage and I think...

45:40.171 --> 45:43.008
-Good. -...I think it's gonna
be an eye opener.

45:43.041 --> 45:44.342
I'm gonna turn it over to Frank

45:44.375 --> 45:46.344
-and we're gonna get a
good hard look at it. -Okay.

45:50.481 --> 45:55.053
FRANK:
This would be the original...

45:55.086 --> 45:56.788
This is the enhanced color.

45:56.822 --> 45:59.290
The contrast brings
out more of the detail.

45:59.324 --> 46:01.259
MARTY:
Holy smokes.

46:03.328 --> 46:06.097
FRANK: Again, this was really
out of focus, unfortunately.

46:06.131 --> 46:09.034
MARTY: It looks like it
actually has depth now.

46:09.067 --> 46:12.904
-I mean, what is it?
-It looks manmade to me.

46:12.938 --> 46:15.240
-And it's real?
-It's real.

46:15.273 --> 46:18.176
Yeah.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.378
Mike, why the hell
didn't you grab it?

46:20.411 --> 46:22.413
(all laughin

46:22.447 --> 46:25.350
FRANK: Well, right here if you
remember the original video

46:25.383 --> 46:26.584
-was very cloudy.
-Yes.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.087
FRANK: Couldn't really
see what it was.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.256
We're running edge sharpening.

46:31.289 --> 46:35.426
We enhanced the color
and then also contrast.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.929
With quite high
certainty, it is metal?

46:37.963 --> 46:40.098
Doesn't look like rock to me.

46:40.131 --> 46:41.833
MARTY: The enhanced images
of the shiny,

46:41.867 --> 46:43.301
gold object made it look

46:43.334 --> 46:45.937
a lot more like a real piece
of metal,

46:45.971 --> 46:49.007
and a lot less
like a reflection.

46:49.040 --> 46:51.609
I had been in the
reflection camp on that.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.578
I was about ready to say,
forget about C-1.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.947
I've always been
highly skeptical

46:55.981 --> 46:57.382
that there could've
been people that far

46:57.415 --> 46:59.450
underground in a
flooded chamber.

46:59.484 --> 47:04.222
But if there's a gold rod
in there that is manmade,

47:04.255 --> 47:08.326
well, then I have to,
you know, suspend disbelief.

47:08.359 --> 47:11.129
Mike, what is that,
in your opinion?

47:11.162 --> 47:13.364
Well, any time you find gold
coins or anything like that--

47:13.398 --> 47:16.034
not to jump right into that,

47:16.067 --> 47:18.937
they're encrusted in
a lot of material.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.406
So, that might just need
to be chipped out of there

47:21.439 --> 47:23.308
with a coal chisel and a hammer.

47:23.341 --> 47:27.078
Looks like gold that's bonded,
you know,

47:27.112 --> 47:29.480
fused to whatever's
down there.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.416
I would think that was
gold if I stuck my head

47:31.449 --> 47:33.384
under the water and saw that.

47:33.418 --> 47:37.989
C-1 is intriguing because
it's uncontaminated.

47:38.023 --> 47:41.392
So, if we pull a manmade
ancient object out of there,

47:41.426 --> 47:43.929
-it's-it's a game changer.
-Below searcher depth?

47:43.962 --> 47:45.630
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

47:45.663 --> 47:48.666
You've given us some reason
to have a look, so...

47:48.699 --> 47:50.201
RICK:
I think we all,

47:50.235 --> 47:51.903
around the table,
came to believe

47:51.937 --> 47:54.973
that that was a manmade object.

47:55.006 --> 47:59.210
But, at some point,
we have to carry the fact

47:59.244 --> 48:01.446
that we now believe
that is a real object to:

48:01.479 --> 48:04.182
How do we get it?
How do we recover it?

48:04.215 --> 48:05.383
Pressure's on, Mike.

48:05.416 --> 48:06.551
I'll be the tool in the toolbox.

48:06.584 --> 48:08.119
(all laughing)

48:08.153 --> 48:18.563
MARTY:
Okay, let's go do it.

48:18.596 --> 48:22.367
NARRATOR: With work on the
South Beach Road complete...
NARRATOR:

48:22.400 --> 48:25.003
the way is now clear
for diver Mike Huntley

48:25.036 --> 48:29.207
and his team to stage dive
operations at the C-1 shaft.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.343
-MARTY: Where is he?
There he is. -Right here.

48:32.377 --> 48:34.980
All right, Dr. Huntley.
Are you ready?

48:35.013 --> 48:36.381
Mr. Lagina, I'm ready
for sure, yeah.

48:36.414 --> 48:39.150
-You ready to get wet?
-Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

48:39.184 --> 48:41.186
NARRATOR: For brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina,

48:41.219 --> 48:43.321
this could be the day

48:43.354 --> 48:45.523
when they retrieve the first
solid evidence that something

48:45.556 --> 48:47.292
of great value was buried

48:47.325 --> 48:51.029
in the Money Pit more
than two centuries ago.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.999
-I think we're all excited.
-Yeah, yeah, we are, too.

48:54.032 --> 48:55.100
We're looking
forward to getting...

48:55.133 --> 48:56.567
getting some answers for ya.

48:56.601 --> 48:59.204
RICK: Today, eyes and boots
are going down C-1

48:59.237 --> 49:04.175
to try to retrieve what we've
come to call these artifacts.

49:04.209 --> 49:05.643
Now, when you fall through,
are you gonna

49:05.676 --> 49:07.412
start searching
as soon as you enter,

49:07.445 --> 49:09.147
or are you going to drop
as low as you can,

49:09.180 --> 49:11.116
-and then come up?
-I'll probably go

49:11.149 --> 49:13.318
to about two feet
above bottom.

49:13.351 --> 49:15.520
We should be able to see it,
from what we saw yesterday,

49:15.553 --> 49:17.755
and just turn so I can
see everything in there,

49:17.788 --> 49:19.257
within reason.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.192
And then if I can
see some targets,

49:21.226 --> 49:22.660
I'm getting those before
anything gets stirred up.

49:25.196 --> 49:26.597
NARRATOR:
In order to avoid disturbing

49:26.631 --> 49:30.168
the silt at the bottom
of the C-1 chamber,

49:30.201 --> 49:32.470
Mike Huntley will
be lowered down

49:32.503 --> 49:36.207
using a device known as
a Bosun's chair.

49:36.241 --> 49:40.745
This will also allow him
to maneuver 360 degrees,

49:40.778 --> 49:45.650
to observe any and all
potentially valuable objects.

49:45.683 --> 49:46.784
-Good morning.
-How's it going?

49:46.817 --> 49:48.453
-How are you?
-Good. Mike.

49:48.486 --> 49:49.787
-Reed. -Reed.
Nice to meet ya. This is Kerry.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.057
Mike. Kerry, nice to meet ya.

49:52.090 --> 49:53.591
NARRATOR:
To ensure Mike Huntley's safety

49:53.624 --> 49:56.494
during and after
the dive operation,

49:56.527 --> 50:00.198
the Oak Island team has
arranged for paramedics--

50:00.231 --> 50:02.700
and even
a decompression chamber--

50:02.733 --> 50:05.303
to be on site.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.772
Okay, so, this is the chamber
we don't want to see you in,

50:07.805 --> 50:10.041
-right? -Yes, this is a good
safety precaution,

50:10.075 --> 50:11.609
hopefully we never have to talk
to Dave for the rest of the day.

50:11.642 --> 50:14.045
Yes. Hello Dave, I'm Marty.

50:14.079 --> 50:15.646
-Dave, this is Marty. -Dave
Roode. -Nice to meet you, sir.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.583
-So, this is it, huh?
-This is the chamber.

50:18.616 --> 50:20.351
Hopefully we don't
have to use it.

50:20.385 --> 50:22.053
No. We don't wanna use it.

50:22.087 --> 50:24.222
NARRATOR:
Of the many risks

50:24.255 --> 50:27.158
that divers face while
descending to great depths,

50:27.192 --> 50:30.395
one of the most dangerous
is decompression sickness--

50:30.428 --> 50:34.232
also known as "the bends."

50:34.265 --> 50:37.335
Prolonged exposure to the harsh
underwater conditions

50:37.368 --> 50:39.404
will also leave Mike Huntley
vulnerable

50:39.437 --> 50:43.474
to other threats,
such as hypothermia.

50:43.508 --> 50:45.143
CRAIG:
It's like 40-degree water.

50:45.176 --> 50:47.245
I mean, he's got a suit
on to protect him,

50:47.278 --> 50:51.249
but that really knocks
your temperature down.

50:51.282 --> 50:53.618
MARTY: There's always a bit
of danger in this kind of dive.

50:53.651 --> 50:55.486
These are technical dives.

50:55.520 --> 50:58.556
Any time you put a man down
inside a 48-inch hole,

50:58.589 --> 51:01.126
you know, with all that gear,
and then it's deep,

51:01.159 --> 51:02.660
and then it's poor visibility.

51:02.693 --> 51:04.562
Yeah, I get-- I get
a little nervous about it.

51:04.595 --> 51:07.064
I want to see that guy come
out of the hole in good shape.

51:17.608 --> 51:20.645
Roger that, loud and clear.

51:20.678 --> 51:23.381
Everything is secure,
main air back online, over.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.657
DAVE:
Roger that.

51:39.197 --> 51:41.599
Mike is going to go down,
he's intrepid,

51:41.632 --> 51:43.468
if anybody's going
to find anything down there,

51:43.501 --> 51:45.136
it's going to be Mike.

51:45.170 --> 51:47.238
These guys are driven
to succeed.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.277
Roger that.

51:54.379 --> 51:57.582
NARRATOR: While the dive
operation in C-1 takes place,

51:57.615 --> 52:01.486
Rick and Marty Lagina,
Craig Tester,

52:01.519 --> 52:05.256
and Dave Blankenship join
dive supervisor Dave Pilot

52:05.290 --> 52:08.926
in the communications trailer.
From here, they will be able

52:08.959 --> 52:11.362
to maintain audio contact
with Mike Huntley...

52:14.532 --> 52:17.868
...as well as monitor the live
video feed from his helmet.

52:22.607 --> 52:25.210
How does it feel, usually you're
watching on a monitor?

52:25.243 --> 52:27.878
-Yeah. -It's a little
bit more intense.

52:27.912 --> 52:29.247
Yeah.

52:33.284 --> 52:35.486
That's pretty good.

52:35.520 --> 52:36.854
CRAIG:
As Mike's going down,

52:36.887 --> 52:38.923
one thing he sees
is the casing.

52:38.956 --> 52:42.527
So, the water clarity's,
you know, still very good,

52:42.560 --> 52:44.729
but we're starting to get
a little bit into the part

52:44.762 --> 52:45.763
of the hole that wasn't cased.

52:53.471 --> 52:55.406
-Stop! -All stop! -All stop!

53:02.780 --> 53:04.849
Perfect.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.890
Roger.

53:12.923 --> 53:14.825
Another four feet,
please, Garet.

53:28.973 --> 53:31.542
That's a lot of particulate.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.251
Roger that.

53:49.927 --> 53:51.529
Roger that.

53:51.562 --> 53:54.299
So, you're going to free
yourself from the Bosun's chair,

53:54.332 --> 53:55.433
is that correct?

54:09.547 --> 54:11.516
NARRATOR:
Unfortunately, Mike Huntley's

54:11.549 --> 54:14.319
plan of using the Bosun's chair

54:14.352 --> 54:18.055
in order to prevent disturbing
the thick silt in the C-1 shaft

54:18.088 --> 54:20.658
is having the opposite effect.

54:20.691 --> 54:22.793
RICK:
Mike enters the hole,

54:22.827 --> 54:25.062
and then it immediately
became clear that,

54:25.095 --> 54:26.931
you know, there was going
to be water clarity issues,

54:26.964 --> 54:28.533
you know, visibility issues.

54:28.566 --> 54:30.735
At that point he-he
changed his game plan.

54:33.638 --> 54:35.640
I think he's doing exactly
what he needs to do.

54:35.673 --> 54:38.309
He's going all the way around.

54:38.343 --> 54:39.944
All the way around
the outer perimeter.

54:45.850 --> 54:47.918
-No.
-Negative.

54:47.952 --> 54:50.355
We have zero visibility now,

54:50.388 --> 54:52.357
we are totally reliant
on what you find, over.

54:58.363 --> 55:01.432
Can he run the metal
detector on the floor?

55:01.466 --> 55:05.570
Mike, we're wondering if you can
take the probe and go around

55:05.603 --> 55:06.771
the bottom perimeter.

55:10.140 --> 55:12.477
NARRATOR: Although he is now
working in virtually

55:12.510 --> 55:14.945
zero-visibility conditions,

55:14.979 --> 55:17.548
Mike Huntley still has
the ability to locate

55:17.582 --> 55:20.618
potentially important or
valuable objects with

55:20.651 --> 55:23.120
an underwater metal detector.

55:23.153 --> 55:26.691
Can you ask him if
he found anything on the floor?

55:26.724 --> 55:29.026
DAVE: Have you found
anything on the floor? Over.

55:34.532 --> 55:36.100
Just to let you know,

55:36.133 --> 55:38.035
we've exceeded our
20-minute planned dive,

55:38.068 --> 55:42.973
we're now into a 25.
The maximum we will go is 35.

55:43.007 --> 55:45.109
If you can live with it,
so can I, over.

55:45.142 --> 55:48.713
-The time goes so fast.
-Yeah.

55:48.746 --> 55:50.648
You know, we're exhilarated
to be having another look

55:50.681 --> 55:52.483
and we're invigorated.

55:52.517 --> 55:54.685
But, on the other hand,
I get frustrated here, I mean,

55:54.719 --> 55:55.853
the clock is ticking, you know.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.930
-What was that?
-Getting metal.

56:09.867 --> 56:13.504
NARRATOR:
Metal? Embedded in the wall?

56:13.538 --> 56:17.074
Could Mike Huntley have finally
located the gold-colored object

56:17.107 --> 56:18.809
in the bottom of C-1?

56:32.189 --> 56:33.758
(tapping)
NARRATOR:
Comi

56:33.791 --> 56:34.959
I heard him tapping.

56:34.992 --> 56:37.127
(tapping)

56:37.161 --> 56:40.097
He's chiseling something out
of the wall, you can hear it.

56:40.130 --> 56:41.766
NARRATOR: It is a tense
and exciting moment

56:41.799 --> 56:44.101
on Oak Island--

56:44.134 --> 56:47.905
as diver Mike Huntley attempts
to retrieve a possible metal

56:47.938 --> 56:52.042
object from the bottom of C-1.

56:52.076 --> 56:54.479
Okay, we're at 30 minutes now.

56:54.512 --> 56:56.213
I'm going to run you for
another three minutes,

56:56.246 --> 56:57.515
and then the dive is over.

57:09.059 --> 57:10.995
The wall comes down
to meet the floor,

57:11.028 --> 57:13.030
if he can kind of just scrape

57:13.063 --> 57:15.099
that with his hands and feel
if there's something there,

57:15.132 --> 57:17.668
I'd say that would be
the best option at this point.

57:17.702 --> 57:19.637
All stop for a second, Mike.

57:19.670 --> 57:22.773
What they would like you
to do is go to the bottom,

57:22.807 --> 57:24.875
go around the perimeter
with your hands...

57:27.545 --> 57:28.546
Affirmative.

57:34.184 --> 57:35.753
-Put it in a bag.
-Yeah, might as well,

57:35.786 --> 57:36.854
might as well get samples.

57:36.887 --> 57:38.956
Please bag up the samples, over.

57:42.627 --> 57:44.061
DAVE:
Roger that.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.897
NARRATOR:
Mike Huntley must act quickly.

57:46.931 --> 57:49.066
He has only seconds left

57:49.099 --> 57:51.836
to scoop up as
much sediment as he can--

57:51.869 --> 57:54.839
and then make it back
to the Bosun's chair.

57:54.872 --> 57:56.741
Be as quick as you can,
please, thank you.

58:00.745 --> 58:03.614
NARRATOR: During deep dives,
nitrogen gases

58:03.648 --> 58:07.151
can become highly compressed
in a diver's bloodstream.

58:07.184 --> 58:09.153
To remove those gasses,

58:09.186 --> 58:12.189
a diver must ascend
back to the surface slowly

58:12.222 --> 58:14.224
and in stages.

58:14.258 --> 58:16.627
Failing to do so can
cause the nitrogen

58:16.661 --> 58:18.563
to form bubbles in the blood,

58:18.596 --> 58:21.999
resulting in
excruciating pain and--

58:22.032 --> 58:24.702
in extreme cases-- death.

58:27.004 --> 58:29.974
It is now a race against time.

58:30.007 --> 58:32.009
We're into extreme
exposure time now,

58:32.042 --> 58:35.546
meaning we're facing not only,

58:35.580 --> 58:38.048
you know, nitrogen building up
in his blood.

58:38.082 --> 58:41.118
Now we're facing
hypothermia as well.

58:41.151 --> 58:43.020
We could be getting into
a life-threatening situation.

58:45.089 --> 58:47.157
DAVE:
Three seconds to chair, over.

58:47.191 --> 58:48.092
Go to chair.

58:54.965 --> 58:57.568
Roger that, confirm when you're
in the chair, ready to travel.

59:08.078 --> 59:10.915
He can leave
that sample bag down there.

59:10.948 --> 59:13.851
He can leave the sample bag.

59:13.884 --> 59:16.253
MARTY: Trying to deal with this
heavy bag of stuff down there,

59:16.286 --> 59:19.089
and, and time is clicking and
it's getting tenser and tenser.

59:21.726 --> 59:23.928
Leave the bag there,
get yourself in the chair, over.

59:28.866 --> 59:30.968
-Leave the bag.
-Leave it there.

59:31.001 --> 59:32.737
Okay, all stop
everything right now,

59:32.770 --> 59:34.071
we got to get something
straightened out.

59:34.104 --> 59:35.072
Are you in the chair?

59:40.077 --> 59:42.312
Are you in the chair?

59:59.129 --> 1:00:00.097
Come again?

1:00:06.103 --> 1:00:09.139
Okay, you're in the chair,
you're clear and free to travel,

1:00:09.173 --> 1:00:10.174
correct?

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:17.314
Roger that,
commencing travel, over.

1:00:17.347 --> 1:00:19.684
Bring him up slow.

1:00:19.717 --> 1:00:21.418
You two are on there.

1:00:21.451 --> 1:00:23.053
DAVE:
Retrieving you slowly,

1:00:23.087 --> 1:00:24.388
sing out if there's
a problem, over.

1:00:30.294 --> 1:00:31.862
Okay, make sure you get him
stripped down

1:00:31.896 --> 1:00:33.698
as fast as you can,

1:00:33.731 --> 1:00:36.166
just get him out of the gear.
Everything, everything.

1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:39.303
Strip the suit off, everything,
we've got seven minutes.

1:00:39.336 --> 1:00:41.005
RICK:
It's scary because

1:00:41.038 --> 1:00:44.008
if he was somehow
caught down there,

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:46.343
there's no way you're going to
send a rescue diver down there.

1:00:46.376 --> 1:00:48.713
Okay, we're on the clock, boys!

1:00:48.746 --> 1:00:50.214
NARRATOR:
Because Mike Huntley

1:00:50.247 --> 1:00:53.117
exceeded his
allotted dive time,

1:00:53.150 --> 1:00:55.820
he must now get inside
the hyperbaric chamber

1:00:55.853 --> 1:00:58.122
as soon as possible.

1:00:58.155 --> 1:01:00.190
This will prevent him
from getting

1:01:00.224 --> 1:01:01.959
potentially deadly
decompression sickness.

1:01:04.461 --> 1:01:06.964
Okay, here he comes.

1:01:06.997 --> 1:01:10.434
We only had seven minutes
to get him up the air column,

1:01:10.467 --> 1:01:12.269
out of the hole, undressed,

1:01:12.302 --> 1:01:14.238
and in the hyperbaric chamber.

1:01:14.271 --> 1:01:16.106
Seven minutes.

1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:19.309
Otherwise there was going
to be serious trouble.

1:01:19.343 --> 1:01:20.945
DAVE: Don't worry about
bags or anything,

1:01:20.978 --> 1:01:23.213
-just get him over.
-Take that bag.

1:01:31.421 --> 1:01:35.159
So, it was a bit of a flurry
when he got out of the hole.

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:37.027
It has to happen quickly or
he's going to get the bends.

1:01:46.136 --> 1:01:48.806
He's going to be in
the chamber for 71 minutes,

1:01:48.839 --> 1:01:50.340
but we're going
to have to monitor him

1:01:50.374 --> 1:01:52.142
after he comes
out of the chamber,

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:54.011
so that'll conclude our
diving for the day.

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:54.979
That's fine, that's fine.
That's fine.

1:01:57.982 --> 1:02:00.217
It was pretty clear
we had pushed the limits.

1:02:00.250 --> 1:02:03.487
We had pushed the limits of
human endurance a little bit.

1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:06.190
You know,
treasure hunt be damned,

1:02:06.223 --> 1:02:07.457
if you're going
to take that risk.

1:02:14.098 --> 1:02:15.232
NARRATOR:
After spending over an hour
NARRATOR:
Comi

1:02:15.265 --> 1:02:16.901
in the hyperbaric chamber...

1:02:16.934 --> 1:02:19.069
Mike Huntley emerges.

1:02:19.103 --> 1:02:22.139
MARTY: Oh, he's out. He's out,
we'd better go talk to him.

1:02:22.172 --> 1:02:25.309
You can hop up there.
Just grab a seat there for me.

1:02:25.342 --> 1:02:26.510
NARRATOR:
Although he shows no signs

1:02:26.543 --> 1:02:28.378
of decompression sickness

1:02:28.412 --> 1:02:30.280
from his prolonged
dive to the bottom

1:02:30.314 --> 1:02:33.250
of the C-1 shaft,
as a precaution,

1:02:33.283 --> 1:02:35.953
he is examined by
the paramedic team.

1:02:35.986 --> 1:02:38.889
So far, all your
vitals are normal.

1:02:38.923 --> 1:02:41.358
-No pain on breathing
or anything like that? -Nope.

1:02:45.362 --> 1:02:47.965
-RICK: How you feeling, Mike?
-Feeling good.

1:02:47.998 --> 1:02:50.234
Yeah, no, good, just cold.

1:02:50.267 --> 1:02:52.202
-Still?
-Almost as cold as the water.

1:02:52.236 --> 1:02:54.104
Well, we're glad you
made it back safe.

1:02:54.138 --> 1:02:55.873
But I wasn't coming
empty-handed.

1:02:55.906 --> 1:02:58.175
Well, we're gonna wait for you
before we open that bag.

1:02:58.208 --> 1:03:00.510
-Okay. -In fact, you're
gonna open the bag.

1:03:00.544 --> 1:03:03.247
It was the right thing to do,
to delay the look-see,

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:04.514
if you will,

1:03:04.548 --> 1:03:06.483
into the bag
that he brought up.

1:03:06.516 --> 1:03:10.888
He-he, look, he went
above and beyond.

1:03:10.921 --> 1:03:12.990
Well done, man.
Well done.

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:15.159
You gave us, you gave us
a start. I'll tell you that.

1:03:15.192 --> 1:03:17.094
It didn't feel right with you
sitting in that chamber

1:03:17.127 --> 1:03:18.528
and us digging through
what you brought up.

1:03:18.562 --> 1:03:20.064
Just didn't,
just didn't feel right.

1:03:20.097 --> 1:03:21.365
So, we'll go have a look

1:03:21.398 --> 1:03:23.000
-when you're ready.
-Cool. I'm ready.

1:03:31.041 --> 1:03:34.011
Man, you did a lot
of work down there.

1:03:34.044 --> 1:03:36.914
That is some nasty
looking stuff.

1:03:36.947 --> 1:03:39.149
NARRATOR: As the team searches
the sediment collected

1:03:39.183 --> 1:03:43.287
from the bottom of C-1 with
a pinpointing metal detector,

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:46.190
they are finding no signs
of the metal objects

1:03:46.223 --> 1:03:50.060
they were convinced they saw
on the underwater camera.

1:03:50.094 --> 1:03:52.262
I mean, I'm not I'm not finding
anything metal.

1:03:52.296 --> 1:03:54.431
But I would like to go
through this more,

1:03:54.464 --> 1:03:56.166
-with the trough.
-Yeah, I think

1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:00.004
it should all be washed
just like you said, Jack.

1:04:00.037 --> 1:04:01.238
We didn't get what we wanted.

1:04:01.271 --> 1:04:04.041
We got a bag full
of muck basically.

1:04:04.074 --> 1:04:06.443
We're still searching
through it, but we didn't get,

1:04:06.476 --> 1:04:08.245
we didn't get any of the things
we saw in the video.

1:04:08.278 --> 1:04:10.114
Not this time.

1:04:10.147 --> 1:04:12.216
The home run would have been
the shiny, gold object,

1:04:12.249 --> 1:04:14.318
there in all its sinuous
beauty, you know.

1:04:14.351 --> 1:04:16.453
That would have been wonderful.
But it didn't happen.

1:04:16.486 --> 1:04:18.222
But you know what,
if this was easy,

1:04:18.255 --> 1:04:20.157
it would have been done
210 years ago, right?

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:22.426
It's not easy.

1:04:22.459 --> 1:04:24.461
NARRATOR:
Could the strange,

1:04:24.494 --> 1:04:27.364
metallic object Mike Huntley
believes he found at the bottom

1:04:27.397 --> 1:04:30.467
of C-1 really be
the same one Rick

1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:35.005
and Charles photographed
two years ago?

1:04:35.039 --> 1:04:37.041
Here, let's get
this out of the way.

1:04:45.549 --> 1:04:47.985
NARRATOR: One day after the
harrowing dive operation

1:04:48.018 --> 1:04:49.219
in the C-1 shaft...

1:04:49.253 --> 1:04:50.955
GARY:
Back to the spoil piles.

1:04:50.988 --> 1:04:57.127
...Alex Lagina, Jack Begley,
Peter Fornetti,

1:04:57.161 --> 1:05:00.998
and Gary Drayton continue
to look for important clues--

1:05:01.031 --> 1:05:02.466
and possible treasure--

1:05:02.499 --> 1:05:05.069
in the spoils excavated
one year ago

1:05:05.102 --> 1:05:07.671
from the search hole
known as GAL-1.

1:05:09.273 --> 1:05:12.376
-We'll start here.
-Start here.

1:05:12.409 --> 1:05:13.710
Come on, baby,

1:05:13.743 --> 1:05:17.114
all we need is one
gold coin on edge.

1:05:17.147 --> 1:05:21.551
That's all I'm asking for,
is just one gold coin.

1:05:21.585 --> 1:05:25.089
I'm pretty sure that this part
of the spoils is higher up,

1:05:25.122 --> 1:05:27.257
I don't think we're going
to find much important here.

1:05:27.291 --> 1:05:30.460
Oh, you never know.

1:05:30.494 --> 1:05:32.997
(detector beeping)

1:05:33.030 --> 1:05:34.331
Sounds iron.

1:05:34.364 --> 1:05:37.534
(detector whining)

1:05:37.567 --> 1:05:39.136
And of course,
it's under a rock.

1:05:49.113 --> 1:05:51.715
-What you got?
-Yeah, I think it...

1:05:51.748 --> 1:05:54.051
Whatever it is, it's moved down
a little bit further,

1:05:54.084 --> 1:05:56.386
might be able to pinpoint it.

1:05:56.420 --> 1:06:00.557
-JACK: You're sure it's not
out yet? -Deeper?

1:06:00.590 --> 1:06:03.760
Yeah, my threshold would
be blanking if it was out.

1:06:03.793 --> 1:06:06.663
Well it must be
pretty big, then.

1:06:06.696 --> 1:06:08.398
If it's this deep, right?

1:06:08.432 --> 1:06:10.134
All right, I'm getting
out of the excavator.

1:06:10.167 --> 1:06:12.369
-JACK: Yeah, come here, Alex.
-Reading deep.

1:06:12.402 --> 1:06:14.038
-Nine inches.
-(detector beeping)

1:06:14.071 --> 1:06:16.340
It's dead under the center
of the search coil.

1:06:16.373 --> 1:06:17.341
It's a deep reading.

1:06:21.645 --> 1:06:24.314
-Oh!
-There you go.

1:06:27.184 --> 1:06:29.319
-Ooh.
-What the heck is that?

1:06:29.353 --> 1:06:32.556
-Come on. Whoa!
-That is sweet!

1:06:32.589 --> 1:06:34.091
-Whoa.
-It's big.

1:06:34.124 --> 1:06:38.195
-It's square, too!
-That is an oldie.

1:06:38.228 --> 1:06:39.663
NARRATOR:
An iron spike?

1:06:39.696 --> 1:06:42.199
Located in the GAL-1 spoils?

1:06:44.501 --> 1:06:48.705
When the Laginas excavated
the GAL-1 shaft one year ago,

1:06:48.738 --> 1:06:52.442
they encountered a mysterious
impenetrable object at a depth

1:06:52.476 --> 1:06:55.212
of 160 feet--

1:06:55.245 --> 1:06:58.315
as well as a number
of artifacts...

1:06:58.348 --> 1:07:01.518
including the strange
hinge-like piece of metal

1:07:01.551 --> 1:07:06.290
and the mysterious gold-plated
18th century button.

1:07:06.323 --> 1:07:09.093
Could this be
another important clue?

1:07:09.126 --> 1:07:12.162
One which indicates that
the team is close to locating

1:07:12.196 --> 1:07:14.364
the original Oak Island
Money Pit?

1:07:14.398 --> 1:07:15.732
Have you seen one
like that before, Gary?

1:07:15.765 --> 1:07:17.167
Yeah, I've seen
plenty like this.

1:07:17.201 --> 1:07:18.702
I'm telling you now.

1:07:18.735 --> 1:07:22.139
This, I actually know
the name of this, guys.

1:07:22.172 --> 1:07:24.208
This is called a rose head nail.

1:07:27.177 --> 1:07:30.480
NARRATOR:
From as far back as 1800 B.C.,

1:07:30.514 --> 1:07:32.782
to the late 18th century--

1:07:32.816 --> 1:07:36.320
construction nails were
originally forged by hand,

1:07:36.353 --> 1:07:38.288
one at a time.

1:07:38.322 --> 1:07:41.125
Nails made by this
method are known as,

1:07:41.158 --> 1:07:43.760
"rose head nails," because
of the petal-like marks on the

1:07:43.793 --> 1:07:46.663
head of the nail made
by the strikes of

1:07:46.696 --> 1:07:48.565
the blacksmith's hammer.

1:07:50.367 --> 1:07:54.138
This is an oldie.
I would say that is...

1:07:54.171 --> 1:07:55.872
1700s.

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:57.674
-Well, that's pretty cool.
-Maybe even 1600s.

1:07:57.707 --> 1:08:00.477
No way!

1:08:00.510 --> 1:08:02.846
-ALEX: Look at that. Wow.
-Yeah.

1:08:02.879 --> 1:08:05.415
ALEX:
Could be the original work.

1:08:05.449 --> 1:08:08.552
NARRATOR: If the rose head
spike proves significant,

1:08:08.585 --> 1:08:11.755
it could shed new light on the
numerous artifacts recovered

1:08:11.788 --> 1:08:14.391
last year from the GAL-1 shaft.

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:16.360
It's really cool to bring up
something like

1:08:16.393 --> 1:08:19.463
the rose head nail from GAL-1
because finding something like

1:08:19.496 --> 1:08:22.132
that means it's a step in the
right direction towards finding

1:08:22.166 --> 1:08:24.401
the exact location
of the Money Pit

1:08:24.434 --> 1:08:26.336
and from there, potentially
finding the treasure.

1:08:27.904 --> 1:08:30.840
We're the first people
to hold this for...

1:08:30.874 --> 1:08:33.710
for maybe 200 years.

1:08:33.743 --> 1:08:35.879
-In a long time, potentially.
-Yeah, a long time.

1:08:35.912 --> 1:08:38.448
-All right, well let's
go show the guys. -All right.

1:08:41.218 --> 1:08:44.254
We were anxious to show
my dad and uncle Rick.

1:08:44.288 --> 1:08:46.190
If it checks out,
it's a big find.

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:55.299
NARRATOR: At the home
of veteran treasure hunter
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

1:08:55.332 --> 1:08:57.867
Dan Blankenship, Rick,

1:08:57.901 --> 1:09:01.238
Marty, and the team meet
to discuss their upcoming

1:09:01.271 --> 1:09:05.275
drilling operation in
the Money Pit area.

1:09:05.309 --> 1:09:07.711
At the age of 94,

1:09:07.744 --> 1:09:11.415
there is perhaps no one who
knows more about Oak Island

1:09:11.448 --> 1:09:13.350
than Dan Blankenship.

1:09:13.383 --> 1:09:16.720
-How the heck are ya? Good.
-Good.

1:09:16.753 --> 1:09:18.888
NARRATOR:
After purchasing a large stake

1:09:18.922 --> 1:09:21.791
in the island
in the late 1960s,

1:09:21.825 --> 1:09:24.828
the former Florida-based
contractor moved

1:09:24.861 --> 1:09:28.665
to Oak Island with his wife,
Jane and never looked back.

1:09:30.834 --> 1:09:32.902
Having spent more than
half-a-century working

1:09:32.936 --> 1:09:35.539
to solve
the Oak Island mystery,

1:09:35.572 --> 1:09:38.542
Dan remains an invaluable
human resource

1:09:38.575 --> 1:09:40.644
and now serves as
the senior partner--

1:09:40.677 --> 1:09:42.979
and chief advisor-- to Rick,

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:46.883
Marty and the entire
Oak Island team.

1:09:46.916 --> 1:09:49.886
We want to bring you up
to speed about the plans,

1:09:49.919 --> 1:09:52.322
you know, as we
move forward here.

1:09:52.356 --> 1:09:53.823
What we're looking
at is a drilling program

1:09:53.857 --> 1:09:55.525
to try to find that vault.

1:09:55.559 --> 1:09:58.395
-Pattern drilling.
-Yes. Yes.

1:09:58.428 --> 1:09:59.663
-Exactly.
-CRAIG: Exactly.

1:09:59.696 --> 1:10:01.965
So, that's what
this pattern is for.

1:10:01.998 --> 1:10:05.269
NARRATOR:
This year, the team is planning

1:10:05.302 --> 1:10:06.903
to employ what is known as,

1:10:06.936 --> 1:10:09.773
"The Geo-tech System."

1:10:09.806 --> 1:10:12.742
It will involve retrieving
core samples taken at depths

1:10:12.776 --> 1:10:14.578
of up to 200 feet

1:10:14.611 --> 1:10:18.615
from approximately
40 six-inch wide holes.

1:10:18.648 --> 1:10:21.685
If successful, the team
should finally be able

1:10:21.718 --> 1:10:25.922
to pinpoint the exact location
of the original Money Pit and,

1:10:25.955 --> 1:10:30.394
hopefully, solve
the Oak Island mystery.

1:10:30.427 --> 1:10:33.563
We'd like to go to bedrock
in all of these holes,

1:10:33.597 --> 1:10:35.765
-and maybe even... -I would
strongly advise it, Rick.

1:10:35.799 --> 1:10:38.402
If you, if you're gonna put
holes down there,

1:10:38.435 --> 1:10:40.404
take 'em to bedrock.

1:10:40.437 --> 1:10:42.472
RICK:
I mean, to have Dan excited

1:10:42.506 --> 1:10:44.674
about any process that we
undertake is significant.

1:10:44.708 --> 1:10:46.510
I mean, one of
the things we wanted

1:10:46.543 --> 1:10:50.814
to do was to give Dan proof
that a lifetime of search,

1:10:50.847 --> 1:10:52.982
a lifetime of commitment,
perseverance,

1:10:53.016 --> 1:10:57.587
and passion for this place
is founded in substance.

1:10:57.621 --> 1:11:00.357
When we did our drilling
in the Money Pit area,

1:11:00.390 --> 1:11:04.694
we didn't have that capability.
Makes a lot of sense.

1:11:04.728 --> 1:11:06.963
Well, we're gonna get
to the bottom of it, Dan.

1:11:06.996 --> 1:11:08.865
We're gonna get to the bottom
of the Money Pit.

1:11:08.898 --> 1:11:12.436
Yeah!
We're checking it off the list.

1:11:12.469 --> 1:11:14.304
-That's what I want to do.
-(door opens)

1:11:14.338 --> 1:11:15.939
I hate to interrupt, but look
what's coming in the door here.

1:11:15.972 --> 1:11:17.974
-Hey, guys.
-We've got company.

1:11:18.007 --> 1:11:20.344
-What's up, guys?
-How's it going?

1:11:20.377 --> 1:11:22.011
-Hey!
-Dan, how are ya?

1:11:22.045 --> 1:11:24.481
-Good to see ya!
-Hey, Dan, how ya doing, mate?

1:11:24.514 --> 1:11:28.084
Go ahead, Gary. We've got some
stuff to show you guys.

1:11:28.117 --> 1:11:30.820
-MARTY: It better be good!
-Grab a chair.

1:11:30.854 --> 1:11:33.390
-Oh, it is! Yup.
-Is it?

1:11:34.924 --> 1:11:36.760
So, as you guys know,

1:11:36.793 --> 1:11:38.628
we've been going over
the GAL-1 spoils...

1:11:38.662 --> 1:11:40.364
-Yes.
-We've been turning them over,

1:11:40.397 --> 1:11:41.765
going over them
with a metal detector,

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:43.032
trying to find things
of interest.

1:11:43.066 --> 1:11:46.770
And, uh, Gary has our finds.

1:11:48.972 --> 1:11:53.677
Wow. That's a big spike.

1:11:53.710 --> 1:11:58.715
What that is, that's an old,
hand-forged nail spike.

1:11:58.748 --> 1:12:01.618
Sometimes called
a rose head spike.

1:12:01.651 --> 1:12:02.986
You may be quite right.

1:12:03.019 --> 1:12:05.955
-Because it has not
got an offset head. -Right.

1:12:05.989 --> 1:12:08.525
And it would almost have
to have an offset head.

1:12:08.558 --> 1:12:11.661
-Right. -First of all,
they'd make the shaft.

1:12:11.695 --> 1:12:13.963
And then they'd put
the head on, afterwards.

1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:18.001
-Yeah. -And then, when it's
bashed into something,

1:12:18.034 --> 1:12:19.869
the shape of it
looks like petals.

1:12:19.903 --> 1:12:23.807
So, these type got
the name "rose head spike."

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:26.543
It's old, though,
this is pre-1780.

1:12:28.144 --> 1:12:30.547
And with that being
in that condition,

1:12:30.580 --> 1:12:32.882
-you know, that's an oldie.
-Where'd you find that?

1:12:32.916 --> 1:12:36.119
On the top of
the GAL-1 spoil pile.

1:12:36.152 --> 1:12:39.523
-Out of the material
that you missed! -Yes.

1:12:39.556 --> 1:12:40.957
-(laughing)
-Yes.

1:12:42.726 --> 1:12:44.127
MARTY:
Gary is more or less

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:45.862
an expert on these things,

1:12:45.895 --> 1:12:48.832
because he's been finding
them his entire life,

1:12:48.865 --> 1:12:50.967
and getting them
dated by experts.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.169
And so, because it's
significant to him,

1:12:53.202 --> 1:12:55.739
it's significant to me.

1:12:55.772 --> 1:12:57.974
You've gone through
all the GAL spoils?

1:12:58.007 --> 1:13:01.478
-Just about. -But, I don't think
that's a railroad spike, Dan,

1:13:01.511 --> 1:13:03.112
because that head is
perfectly symmetrical.

1:13:03.146 --> 1:13:04.948
Most railroad spikes that

1:13:04.981 --> 1:13:08.184
-I've seen all had
offset heads on them. -Right.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:12.055
I mean, it's very significant,
in my opinion.

1:13:12.088 --> 1:13:15.825
I'd be chompin' the bit
until I at least had it analyzed

1:13:15.859 --> 1:13:18.495
and-and-and see if they
could kind of date it,

1:13:18.528 --> 1:13:21.030
you know?

1:13:21.064 --> 1:13:24.000
But you think on the surface--
by observation alone--

1:13:24.033 --> 1:13:26.536
-you think pre-1780?
-Yeah.

1:13:26.570 --> 1:13:28.605
And I was being conservative.

1:13:28.638 --> 1:13:30.073
This could be a lot older.

1:13:30.106 --> 1:13:32.909
I wouldn't be surprised
if this is really old.

1:13:32.942 --> 1:13:36.880
-This could dip into the 1600s.
-If we can verify that,

1:13:36.913 --> 1:13:38.648
I'm holding a piece of
the original Money pit.

1:13:56.600 --> 1:13:58.134
NARRATOR:
On the heels of what could be

1:13:58.167 --> 1:14:00.504
a breakthrough discovery...

1:14:00.537 --> 1:14:02.872
Hey, guys, welcome back.
We've had a great start.

1:14:02.906 --> 1:14:04.974
...Rick, Marty,
and the Oak Island team

1:14:05.008 --> 1:14:06.643
gather in the War Room

1:14:06.676 --> 1:14:09.178
to plot their
critical next moves.

1:14:09.212 --> 1:14:11.080
We got some interesting
things that have turned up,

1:14:11.114 --> 1:14:14.117
we've got some data to report,
we got some things to discuss.

1:14:14.150 --> 1:14:15.719
Well, I think the, you know,

1:14:15.752 --> 1:14:18.822
Gary finding that
spike in GAL-1,

1:14:18.855 --> 1:14:20.857
I'm impressed.
I think we can get it tested.

1:14:20.890 --> 1:14:22.258
In some way, shape, or form.

1:14:22.291 --> 1:14:24.060
MARTY:
The GAL-1 area,

1:14:24.093 --> 1:14:26.763
I think of the four
we dug last year,

1:14:26.796 --> 1:14:31.668
-is the most interesting by far.
And remains interesting. -Yes.

1:14:31.701 --> 1:14:33.503
You know, we had
that weird metal,

1:14:33.537 --> 1:14:37.574
and old looking stuff.
And now this.

1:14:37.607 --> 1:14:41.010
We got the weird-shaped
fastening bolt.

1:14:41.044 --> 1:14:45.715
We got the button,
and now we got this spike.

1:14:45.749 --> 1:14:49.085
It keeps giving us clues,
but what are the clues?

1:14:49.118 --> 1:14:52.589
If the spike comes back
and it's very early,

1:14:52.622 --> 1:14:55.224
and we have an interest
in saying to ourselves,

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:58.528
"Hey, if that's there,
we find this in the GAL spoils,

1:14:58.562 --> 1:15:01.164
maybe we should
revisit that hole."

1:15:01.197 --> 1:15:04.868
For future activity,
regarding dives,

1:15:04.901 --> 1:15:08.137
-we gave Mike way too many
tasks. -No question.

1:15:08.171 --> 1:15:10.674
-He was, went over
on his eco time. -Yeah.

1:15:10.707 --> 1:15:13.743
RICK: He just simply can't
do all of these things.

1:15:13.777 --> 1:15:16.045
MARTY: Anyway, it got
a bit hairy there.

1:15:16.079 --> 1:15:18.782
You know, God bless him,
he wanted to complete his task.

1:15:18.815 --> 1:15:20.183
Here's the deal:

1:15:20.216 --> 1:15:22.886
We haven't found,
or at least retrieved,

1:15:22.919 --> 1:15:24.888
whatever the shiny,
gold object is, so...

1:15:24.921 --> 1:15:26.623
I'm all for him
doing other dives,

1:15:26.656 --> 1:15:29.325
but I think we can
lessen the danger factor.

1:15:29.358 --> 1:15:31.027
By keeping it down
to one thing only.

1:15:31.060 --> 1:15:32.729
Exactly, David.

1:15:32.762 --> 1:15:34.330
So, let's talk about
what his task is.

1:15:34.363 --> 1:15:37.000
We all agree it's one task--
what is it?

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:38.868
Well, we've got multiple targets
down there

1:15:38.902 --> 1:15:40.970
that we're
wondering if they're metal.

1:15:41.004 --> 1:15:43.306
So, I think he should go down
with the metal detector,

1:15:43.339 --> 1:15:45.041
and see what he can find
down there on the bottom.

1:15:45.074 --> 1:15:46.776
Just that.

1:15:46.810 --> 1:15:48.612
Metal detector, Mike,
don't do anything else?

1:15:48.645 --> 1:15:50.580
Or does he, I suppose he
tries to retrieve it?

1:15:50.614 --> 1:15:52.281
Absolutely, I don't
want to have a hit,

1:15:52.315 --> 1:15:55.952
and say "it was over here,"
and come back and can't find it.

1:15:55.985 --> 1:15:58.722
-Find and retrieve.
-Yup. -Okay.

1:15:58.755 --> 1:16:01.357
-Two words. -MARTY:
Okay, that sounds like a plan.

1:16:01.390 --> 1:16:02.759
Yep.

1:16:04.293 --> 1:16:07.230
Look, guys...

1:16:07.263 --> 1:16:10.634
I mean...

1:16:10.667 --> 1:16:13.236
We're really glad you
guys are back, I mean...

1:16:22.378 --> 1:16:26.249
The pain of missing Drake,
you know, I can,

1:16:26.282 --> 1:16:30.754
I can say this for sure,
amongst every guy here...

1:16:30.787 --> 1:16:32.622
you know, we'd
do anything for you.

1:16:32.656 --> 1:16:37.093
We miss him, he was a great kid.
Great brother. Great son.

1:16:37.126 --> 1:16:40.664
It was a big part of his life,
out here with you guys...

1:16:42.365 --> 1:16:46.402
Yeah, I-I thank you.

1:16:46.435 --> 1:16:49.105
It's going to be
tough without him.

1:16:49.138 --> 1:16:50.974
(sniffles)

1:16:51.007 --> 1:16:53.076
But I know he wants us here.
That's the big point.

1:17:00.083 --> 1:17:01.117
You know, it's...
(sniffles)

1:17:05.188 --> 1:17:07.957
I-- he was a big part
of all of our lives.

1:17:07.991 --> 1:17:09.759
MARTY:
Yes.

1:17:09.793 --> 1:17:11.094
JACK:
I know everyone--

1:17:11.127 --> 1:17:14.397
he thought of all you guys
as family, and...

1:17:14.430 --> 1:17:18.367
I know he wouldn't
want us to stop looking.

1:17:18.401 --> 1:17:19.769
You know, I guess
to some extent,

1:17:19.803 --> 1:17:23.873
we're gonna carry on...
for him.

1:17:23.907 --> 1:17:26.342
RICK: It's more than "we're
going to carry on for him."

1:17:26.375 --> 1:17:29.979
We're going to
carry on with him.

1:17:30.013 --> 1:17:31.848
-DAVE: Yes. He's in our
thoughts all the time. -Yup.

1:17:31.881 --> 1:17:34.984
MARTY: Absolutely.
The fellowship goes on.

1:17:35.018 --> 1:17:35.952
Never feel alone.

1:17:40.023 --> 1:17:41.691
MARTY:
I hope it's right for Craig

1:17:41.725 --> 1:17:44.027
and Jack to be out here.

1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:47.697
-For them.
-How it impacts us...

1:17:47.731 --> 1:17:49.398
-Doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter.

1:17:49.432 --> 1:17:52.301
I mean, it only matters that we,

1:17:52.335 --> 1:17:56.740
the Oak Island Family,
this small one here,

1:17:56.773 --> 1:18:00.944
can be there for them,
support them, care about them.

1:18:00.977 --> 1:18:02.979
That's all.

1:18:03.012 --> 1:18:05.414
-Just remember how he
signed that caisson. -Yeah.

1:18:05.448 --> 1:18:07.984
-"Forever family."
-Yeah.

1:18:11.988 --> 1:18:13.156
Here you go, bro.

1:18:25.068 --> 1:18:26.903
CRAIG:
Being here without Drake is...

1:18:26.936 --> 1:18:29.839
is tough.
It's really tough.

1:18:34.143 --> 1:18:36.445
-You want to be my
pinpointer today? -Sure.

1:18:36.479 --> 1:18:38.514
All right. It's been a while.

1:18:38.547 --> 1:18:40.817
JACK:
I would say that this island,

1:18:40.850 --> 1:18:44.087
it was our place
to bond as a family.

1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:47.757
And...
it was really a place where...

1:18:47.791 --> 1:18:49.125
all of us connected.

1:18:53.897 --> 1:18:56.432
CRAIG: I know he would want Jack
and I to be here,

1:18:56.465 --> 1:18:58.434
to follow our own dreams.

1:18:58.467 --> 1:19:02.405
I mean, he was big on following
what you believed in.

1:19:02.438 --> 1:19:06.209
It's tough to follow
your dream when, you know,

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:08.778
my dream was never not
to have Drake with me.

1:19:29.098 --> 1:19:34.037
MARTY: Drake Tester was...
just a great kid.

1:19:34.070 --> 1:19:37.807
Smart, kind;
I mean, I loved him.

1:19:37.841 --> 1:19:39.508
We're all going
to miss him terribly.

1:19:39.542 --> 1:19:41.244
Drake, why here?

1:19:41.277 --> 1:19:43.346
Why did you want to come
work here as opposed to,

1:19:43.379 --> 1:19:44.881
maybe the more
seemingly exciting Money Pit

1:19:44.914 --> 1:19:48.217
-or something like that,
why here? -It's just...

1:19:48.251 --> 1:19:50.887
the fact that we could
find these box drains

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:52.155
that would then...

1:19:52.188 --> 1:19:54.190
prove the story.

1:19:54.223 --> 1:19:56.860
And that's huge for me.

1:19:56.893 --> 1:19:59.428
CRAIG:
You know, over the history,

1:19:59.462 --> 1:20:01.364
a number of different
families have been out here.

1:20:01.397 --> 1:20:05.268
So, it's nice to have my family
adding to the story.

1:20:05.301 --> 1:20:08.104
JACK:
Get it. What is it?

1:20:08.137 --> 1:20:10.406
DRAKE: Maybe a piece of...
chest handle?

1:20:10.439 --> 1:20:12.275
JACK:
Yeah, it is a handle, good call.

1:20:17.446 --> 1:20:19.849
JACK:
We're going to miss him, but...

1:20:19.883 --> 1:20:22.285
he's always going to be with us.

1:20:27.456 --> 1:20:28.958
Way to go, Drake.

1:20:49.913 --> 1:20:52.381
NARRATOR: This season on
The Curse of Oak Island...

1:20:52.415 --> 1:20:54.884
MARTY: Here we go.
Are you ready to find treasure?

1:20:54.918 --> 1:20:57.453
-I'm ready. -Okay, let's make
hole. -Let's get up there.

1:20:57.486 --> 1:20:58.988
My goal is to find
the one thing.

1:21:00.623 --> 1:21:03.259
-Sweet! -Holy smokes.
-Spendables.

1:21:03.292 --> 1:21:05.561
...right baby,
this means something!

1:21:05.594 --> 1:21:06.529
We're nearing
the end of the hunt.

1:21:08.364 --> 1:21:10.299
We're gonna make it
possible to miss.

1:21:10.333 --> 1:21:12.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:21:12.268 --> 1:21:14.603
-I think we found the Money Pit.
-I know we found the Money Pit.

1:21:14.637 --> 1:21:16.539
RICK:
Might this be the back door

1:21:16.572 --> 1:21:19.342
to the underground
workings under Oak Island?

1:21:19.375 --> 1:21:21.044
RICK:
This is a Templar cross.

1:21:23.079 --> 1:21:25.949
-Nothing like that has
ever come to surface. -Whoa.

1:21:25.982 --> 1:21:27.316
-It's bone.
-Is it human?

1:21:29.152 --> 1:21:31.287
RICK:
Oh (bleep), somebody got hurt.

1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:32.989
MARTY:
When you see an accident unfold

1:21:33.022 --> 1:21:36.292
before your eyes,
it's very sobering.

1:21:36.325 --> 1:21:38.394
It looks like a key
for a lock within a lock.

1:21:38.427 --> 1:21:40.496
MARTY:
Having evidence in your hand.

1:21:40.529 --> 1:21:42.966
RICK: This is it.
This is the end game.

1:21:42.999 --> 1:21:44.968
We not only found the Money Pit,
the Money Pit is real.

1:21:45.001 --> 1:21:46.502
