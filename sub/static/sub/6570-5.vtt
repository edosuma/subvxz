00:05.373 --> 00:09.108
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:17.385 --> 00:21.086
People are always asking me,
"Who is Roger Furlong?"

00:21.088 --> 00:24.423
And I always refer them to the
same passage of the Good Book.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.591
The Scriptures.

00:25.593 --> 00:30.195
- "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall
know them." -<i> ( crowd cheers )</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:31.363
Selina:
<i>All right, let's do it.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.699
Being the First Daughter
is a big responsibility.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.702
- Good.
- But I'm happy to serve my country

00:36.704 --> 00:40.439
- and to help out my mom.
- That's very good, yes.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.574
- I love you, Mom.
- Oh, no, honey.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.110
You've got to say it like you
mean it, though, darling.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.479
It's so easy.
It's like, "I love you, Mom.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.714
- I love you."
- Well, not like that.

00:48.716 --> 00:52.684
There are great changes coming for
this nation and my own life, too.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.187
Last year I met
a boy called Jason.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.389
Mm, I don't know, should
she say boy or man?

00:57.391 --> 01:00.092
- Just to be clear?
- Yes, that's a good question, ma'am.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.560
It's clear that
I'm a man, isn't it?

01:01.562 --> 01:04.163
I haven't been carded for years.
Like, three years.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.432
I just... I don't know
if this is gonna play well.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.834
You know what? I started
to feel that way myself.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.070
It's a convention.
People love this shit.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.172
How could it not play well?
We're in love.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.274
- Yeah, it might play well.
- It could.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.309
- I think it might.
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.577
I cannot take Karen anymore.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.614
It's been weeks and she has yet
to speak a declarative sentence.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.349
Lawyers tend to cover
their bases.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.618
I know that from
my car accident.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.653
With a lawyer.

01:27.655 --> 01:28.587
I just tune her out.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.255
You know, like living
next to a highway.

01:30.257 --> 01:34.693
Last year I met a guy called
Jason and we fell in love.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.362
All right, sweetheart, it doesn't
sound like you're in love to me.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.364
It sounds like you've been
kidnapped by the Taliban.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.634
- Karen: <i> Exactly.</i>
- And we're going to get married.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.737
So I'd like to introduce
you to Jason.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.772
Come on out, honey.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.274
- It sounds like you're angry.
- I am angry!

01:49.276 --> 01:50.776
Well, that's why you
sound like you're angry.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.479
- Hide it.
- Conceal it for a second.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.413
Good, conceal it.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.349
If you eat a zucchini anywhere
in mainland North America,

01:57.351 --> 02:00.652
there's a 20% chance
it's one of my zucchini.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.554
Well, I am such a zucchini fan,

02:02.556 --> 02:04.356
I practically photosynthesize.

02:04.358 --> 02:07.126
- ( chuckles )
- Next year I want 24%.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.627
Well, listen,
Dan here is the man.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.128
<i>He's fresh from the White House,</i>

02:10.131 --> 02:11.697
he's got a Rolodex as crammed

02:11.699 --> 02:12.865
as a drug mule's poop pocket.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.601
And I want to take
zucchini to the next level.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.202
Great, I'm in town
till tomorrow,

02:17.204 --> 02:20.506
so any big dogs you can get
me in a room with today?

02:20.508 --> 02:21.406
That's gonna be tricky.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.875
Everyone's out of town
for the convention,

02:22.877 --> 02:25.310
so the only people left
in DC work at CVS, but...

02:25.312 --> 02:29.148
<i>Dan's just being modest. I mean,
you know everybody, right, Dan?</i>

02:29.150 --> 02:31.383
Flex that Rolodex, pal.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.552
Uh, yeah.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.887
You ever hear of Jonah Ryan?

02:34.889 --> 02:37.389
- No.
- Old buddy of mine. We go way back.

02:37.391 --> 02:40.626
Love that guy. I can get you
in a room with him today.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.794
All right, listen.
Enough business, let's eat.

02:42.796 --> 02:46.598
Okay? But probably not fucking
zucchini, right? ( laughs )

02:46.600 --> 02:49.768
I'd like to introduce
you to Jason.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.869
<i>Come on out, honey.</i>

02:50.871 --> 02:53.572
Selina:
<i>Okay, and now a kiss.</i>

02:53.574 --> 02:56.575
- Oh! That needs work.
- That needs work.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.310
- Which part?
- All of it.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.645
- How hard is it to kiss somebody?
- I know.

02:59.647 --> 03:03.182
You just put your head close to theirs,
you let your lips touch, you know?

03:03.184 --> 03:05.617
Do I need to demonstrate this?

03:05.619 --> 03:06.418
- No.
- No.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.353
Okay, he can practice
the walk on his own time.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.489
We really need to look
at the president's speech now.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.457
Hey, human emotion,
you can't rush it.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.326
It's not a precise science, Amy.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.696
All sciences are precise.
That's what science means.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.264
That's open to interpretation.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.232
- Yes.
- Extraordinary.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.834
Ma'am, there's a death row
inmate in Louisiana.

03:22.836 --> 03:23.702
Ugh, sounds good.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.903
He was given
a new drug cocktail,

03:24.905 --> 03:27.639
but it didn't work,
so basically he's not dead.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.208
- He's half dead.
- Half dead?

03:29.210 --> 03:31.243
- Yeah, he's been half-acuted.
- Mike: <i> Awful.</i>

03:31.245 --> 03:33.378
Like being decapitated
but surviving.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.313
Happens to chickens a lot.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.950
Well, some might say that we're
being slightly headless ourselves.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.551
We really need to focus
on your speech.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.854
Well, there is this new execution
issue, so that's the priority.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.224
Right. Do you think we should
issue a statement or...

03:45.226 --> 03:48.660
Yes, but a statement that can
be repurposed if things change.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.395
<i>He dies, he doesn't
die, or whatever.</i>

03:50.397 --> 03:53.832
- Yeah, that's very clever. Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:54.935 --> 03:55.767
So it's true.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.003
They hacked the data
of thousands of dead kids

03:58.005 --> 04:03.542
to directly target bereaved parents
with this charming mailer.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.644
Wow, dead kids...
That never sounds good

04:05.646 --> 04:07.246
unless you're
a stressed-out single mom.

04:07.248 --> 04:10.282
This and they polled against me?
That's it, I'm out.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.317
No, sir, that's the wrong move.
You can't...

04:12.319 --> 04:14.620
There's only one midget I'm
gonna let tell me what to do,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.622
and I'm gonna go
tell her that I'm done.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.990
She doesn't have time
to replace you.

04:17.992 --> 04:21.793
What's she gonna do, pin a dick
on Gary and give him the job?

04:21.795 --> 04:22.761
She's got a couple hours.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.696
I mean, that's more than
enough time in politics.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.532
No, wait a minute, it's not.
Tough shitski.

04:27.534 --> 04:32.938
- <i>( applause )</i> - So I'd like to
say to all you young people,

04:32.940 --> 04:34.606
join me

04:34.608 --> 04:38.744
and let's rock
these United States.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.512
<i>( cheering, applause )</i>

04:40.514 --> 04:42.347
So, really, we wanted
to go progressive.

04:42.349 --> 04:42.948
- Ma'am.
- Yeah?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.284
I have a useful college
friend in the enemy camp

04:45.286 --> 04:46.485
with a small brain
and a big mouth.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.587
She says that Senator
O'Brien's running mate

04:48.589 --> 04:51.890
- is going to be Laura Montez.
- <i>( silverware clangs )</i>

04:51.892 --> 04:52.991
- Montez?
- Yeah.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.061
New Mexico senator Laura Montez?

04:56.063 --> 04:58.730
- Mm-hmm.
- She's brilliant.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.633
She's pretty.
She's charming.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.535
She's a woman!

05:03.537 --> 05:05.704
She's fucking ethnic!

05:05.706 --> 05:06.938
This is Latinageddon.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.840
I wish I was that guy
on death row.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.642
Apparently he's
vomiting black bile.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.478
- Well, I don't even care.
- This is such a bold move.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.447
It's clever.
It's a really bold move.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.349
- Yes, that's what I said.
- All right.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.051
There's nothing on
the Internet about Montez

05:19.053 --> 05:21.586
except for the usual
Photoshopped nudity.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.855
Selina: <i>O'Brien's
really broken us here.</i>

05:23.857 --> 05:26.325
He gets sexy Mexi.
What am I stuck with?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.827
- Doyle?
- Steve Martin's boring older brother.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.529
I mean, it doesn't make
any sense to say this,

05:30.531 --> 05:33.832
but, I mean, I really, really
wish we could get rid of Doyle.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.102
- Ma'am. - What if we could put
Danny Chung on the ticket with us?

05:37.104 --> 05:40.672
That would totally fuck up that
fiesta of theirs, wouldn't it?

05:40.674 --> 05:43.442
Ma'am, the vice president's
here and he looks pissed.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.577
- Even more than usual.
- Hi, Andrew.

05:45.579 --> 05:49.748
Ma'am, we need to have one of
those one-on-one conversations.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.351
- Uh-huh.
- You know, the kind that you promised

05:52.353 --> 05:54.553
- we'd have once a week.
- Oh, snarky.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.055
Okay, yeah. Let's go have
a talk in the bedroom.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.925
It's really dirty in there.
Do you want me to tidy up just...

05:59.927 --> 06:02.861
Oh, I don't care.
Oh, fuck it.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.996
Oh, sorry for all
this crap everywhere.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.565
- So, what's...
- Hear me out, Selina.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.934
I regret to inform you that
I'm stepping off the ticket.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.770
- What? - I will stay on as
veep through the inauguration.

06:11.772 --> 06:15.941
Then I am getting in my Dodge and
I'm getting the hell out of Dodge.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.510
I don't... I mean,
what are you talk...

06:18.512 --> 06:20.679
I am furious.
Ben.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.681
- Yeah?
- Are you hearing what I just heard?

06:22.683 --> 06:23.949
I don't know
if I heard correctly.

06:23.951 --> 06:28.620
- Something about resigning?
- Yeah, he's stepping off the ticket.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.988
It's a matter of principle.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.090
There is no way
on God's green cock

06:32.092 --> 06:34.126
that you can get out
on matter of principle.

06:34.128 --> 06:36.628
- That's right.
- It has to be a health issue.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.662
No, I'm perfectly healthy.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.898
- You have prostate problems.
- I'm not gonna say that.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.568
- That's embarrassing.
- Exactly. That's what makes it more real.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.138
I'm not gonna lie, Selina.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.607
He said he's not gonna lie, Ben.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.141
( exhales )

06:49.143 --> 06:52.544
You know, there's been some
very serious allegations

06:52.546 --> 06:55.680
coming from the vice president's
office about sexual abuse.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.048
- Excuse me?
- What?

06:57.050 --> 07:00.786
- Yeah, Jonah Ryan.
- Jonah? Oh, my God.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.154
Those poor interns.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.889
No, no, no, Jonah's the victim.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.457
- Your man Teddy.
- What?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.658
Yeah, he's been
fondling Jonah's balls

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
like he's trying to figure out
what the prize inside is.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.029
I knew nothing about this, Ben.
Nothing, Selina.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.964
- So how can you be a man of principle...
- Yeah.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.567
- When you're condoning sexual abuse...
- Sexual abuse.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.103
- in your own office? Who are
you, the pope? - In your office.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.872
- ( sighs ) - I'll go write a draft.
Come on.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.808
Yeah, prostate,
not principle, huh?

07:22.810 --> 07:25.944
Yeah, that's what we'll...
We'll go with that.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.013
Oh, okay.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.815
( gasps ) Oh, my
God, what's wrong?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.082
- Doyle is a goner.
- What?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.651
He's stepping off the ticket.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.586
- What?
- In the middle of a convention?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.088
- I know!
- Chung is our answer to Montez.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.524
- He can be our minority retort.
- Yes!

07:39.526 --> 07:41.626
Hey, way to work
that sexual abuse.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.197
( laughing ) It's like
Christmas except happy.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.232
Ma'am, I'm elated.
This is great news.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.800
Yeah, that's your elated face.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.669
We need to pick
a running mate now, okay?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.537
So do you want
to discuss our options?

07:52.539 --> 07:53.572
It has to be Danny Chung.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.906
That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.108
- Isn't that spooky?
- Not even remotely.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.845
Okay, go get Danny Chung.
Mike! Oh, my God!

07:59.847 --> 08:02.047
Ah, they found a pulse
on the death row guy.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.815
- Oh.
- Now they can kill him properly.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.183
God, you'd think
they could do that right.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.720
Death row... the clue
is in the name.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.691
Welcome to the real DC, boys.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.558
Dan Central.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.093
Hello, gentlemen.
Sidney Purcell.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.061
- Hi, Jonah Ryan.
- Oh, Jonah.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.230
Excellent. Dan, why don't you
get these guys some coffee?

08:18.232 --> 08:20.832
Oh, no, you don't need
to get me a coffee.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.134
Although, coffee actually
does sound delicious.

08:23.136 --> 08:27.606
Yeah, funny thing. I think
the machine's on the fritz.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.140
Is it?
We had coffee earlier.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.742
There's no way
it could be on the fritz.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.077
<i>Just double check
and see if it is.</i>

08:32.078 --> 08:34.913
But if it's not, I think
I'll take a soy cap.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.816
- And, Richard?
- Eggnog latte if it's in season.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.552
<i>Is it? No, it isn't. Okay,
I'll have a skinny cap.</i>

08:40.554 --> 08:41.686
And a biscotti if you've got it.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.988
And I'll have a double espresso.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.991
- I'll see you guys in a minute.
- Fantastic.

08:47.895 --> 08:48.960
Oh, Dan, that's good.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.997
So we're interested in finding
the pesticide levers.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.865
Specifically the levers
that make pesticides happen.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.669
And Jonah here is the guy behind the guy.
Isn't that right?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.104
Yeah, oh,
I'm the wheel-greaser.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.273
I'm the puppet master.
A man of many nicknames.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.842
- Poonslayer.
- <i>( phone chimes, buzzes )</i>

09:03.844 --> 09:06.545
When I'm online.
Video games?

09:06.547 --> 09:08.813
The vice president
is leaving the ticket.

09:08.815 --> 09:09.981
Yep. Wait, what?

09:09.983 --> 09:13.151
The vice president
is leaving the ticket?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.219
Y-yes. Yes, he is.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.988
How am I hearing this
at the same time as you?

09:16.990 --> 09:20.125
Well, the important thing
is that we have a plan B.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.893
Right, Dan?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.595
Yes. Uh...

09:23.597 --> 09:25.697
I'm gonna call my good
friend Amy Brookheimer.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.098
She's the president's
campaign manager.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.134
She and I are closer than two
fat guys in an elevator.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.102
- This is not a big deal.
- You know what? Building off that,

09:31.104 --> 09:32.871
I'm actually gonna go ahead
and give her a call, too.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.839
We used to date, so I
know her inside and out.

09:34.841 --> 09:37.309
I used to work for Ames. In fact,
I call her Ames for short...

09:37.311 --> 09:38.944
Wait, actually,
it's long for Amy.

09:38.946 --> 09:42.013
Okay, let me know
when you have her.

09:42.015 --> 09:42.781
Right.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.150
What did I do in a past
life to deserve Karen?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.319
I think you must have given the
go-ahead for Pearl Harbor.

09:47.321 --> 09:50.689
Well, the problem with Karen is that
she's the president's best friend.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.957
Best female friend,
let's be honest.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.858
Okay, everybody, Chung
should be here any second.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.628
- All right. - I just heard Chung
should be here any second.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.363
We've got ourselves a meeting.
Am I right?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.899
- You are right.
- Go get 'em, ma'am.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.035
Mike: <i>Don't look desperate.
Men don't like that.</i>

10:04.738 --> 10:06.871
Chung: <i>The first
time I spoke here,</i>

10:06.873 --> 10:09.107
- they called it Chungmania.
- I do remember that.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.275
- Chungmania.
- Of course.

10:10.277 --> 10:14.279
And I remember being so excited
to have a mania named after me.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.215
- Sure.
- I had Chungmania mania.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.083
( laughing )

10:18.085 --> 10:22.153
I love it when you tell that story.
It's so funny.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.924
Well, Danny, come January,

10:25.926 --> 10:28.093
I would be so pleased

10:28.095 --> 10:31.162
if you would serve alongside me

10:31.164 --> 10:33.732
as my vice president.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.667
( laughs )

10:35.669 --> 10:38.970
You do me a great honor,
Madam President.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.272
- Yeah. Yeah.
- But I do need to consult my wife.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.774
Oh, of course.
Oh, no, no, no, yes.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.845
And my Bible. Although she is
my Bible, so that's two Bibles.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.715
Well, you take as many
of the 15 minutes available

10:50.717 --> 10:53.051
as you need to make
this decision.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.054
- Sure. Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.790
( beeping )

10:58.792 --> 10:59.691
Congressman Pierce.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.359
I hear you guys are looking
for a new vice president.

11:01.361 --> 11:05.964
- It's not gonna be you. - No, I just
wanted to wish you guys good luck.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.833
Oh, that's nice.
Fuck off, I'm busy.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.770
Vice President Doyle
stepping off the ticket.

11:11.772 --> 11:12.737
Who made this decision?

11:12.739 --> 11:15.407
It was a joint decision
made by the president,

11:15.409 --> 11:19.144
vice president,
and the vice president's,

11:19.146 --> 11:22.080
uh... prostate doctor.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.348
30 years as a senator

11:23.350 --> 11:26.017
and your asshole's getting more
screen time than your face.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.086
I understand you've been
feeling up Jonah Ryan.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.320
And by up, I mean
all the way up.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.222
Congressman Furlong
does not want to hear this.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.858
Oh, which means I absolutely,
totally fucking do.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.861
- Please go on. - I understand
you've been twirling Jonah's balls

11:36.863 --> 11:39.431
like they're some kind
of exotic stress reducer.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.200
I wish someone would
sexually assault my staff.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.069
And by staff I mean penis.
( laughs )

11:44.071 --> 11:45.704
- Oh, you guys are serious.
- No, listen.

11:45.706 --> 11:49.808
I mean, which of us hasn't
gotten off in some guy's junk?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.342
- You know, just for a laugh?
- I haven't.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.145
I want you to use your dirty
hands, clean out your desk.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.947
- You're fired.
- You...

11:55.949 --> 11:58.817
Sir, everything I have
done, everything...

11:58.819 --> 12:00.251
has been to serve you.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.922
And that goes double
for fondling Jonah.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.457
<i>( door opens, slams )</i>

12:05.459 --> 12:08.960
Have you been watching this?
This is a fascinating show.

12:08.962 --> 12:13.364
I know that it's big,
the problem and the prostate,

12:13.366 --> 12:14.766
which is not good.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.935
Sounds like you might die.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.170
- Madam President.
- Here's my guy.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.839
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.340
You talk with both
of your Bibles, did you?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.476
- I have, and, um...
- Yes, come, come, come, come.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.979
- I would love to serve you as
vice president... - Oh, my God.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.448
- But I can't.
- Hmm?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.118
- ( camera clicking )
- I can't.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.955
Are you kidding? How could
you possibly say no to this?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.324
- Could you please stop?
- Could you please stop?!

12:39.326 --> 12:40.458
Thank you.
Um...

12:40.460 --> 12:43.962
all I can say is
it's family issues.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.197
What, are you knocked up?
What's the real reason?

12:46.199 --> 12:49.367
- What is it?
- It's the way you operate, ma'am.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.269
You have a great way
of operating.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.871
- I absolutely do.
- It's terrific, really.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.940
- Yeah.
- But it's not the way I like to operate.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.275
So, I'm sorry, I just can't.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.178
- I can see you're upset.
- No, I'm not... I mean, I am upset.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.846
Why wouldn't I be upset?
This is bullshit.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.382
Well, I can assure you there
is no one more upset than me.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.917
You don't look upset
at all, Danny.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.152
That's just military training.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.953
I'm sorry, but I have to
address the convention.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.488
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.091
I'm sorry, didn't mean to pull that.
But listen to me.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.260
- What comes after veep?
- President?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.294
President, right.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.931
And you never know. Someday
somebody might just...

13:19.933 --> 13:21.399
( imitates gunshot )

13:21.401 --> 13:23.968
I'm sorry. Again,
thank you for asking.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.570
I am honored and humbled.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.438
No, you're not!

13:28.341 --> 13:30.441
- He said no.
- Gary: Oh, God!

13:30.443 --> 13:31.976
Actually, let me
elaborate on that.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.246
The shitty, two-faced,
fat fucking turd said no.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.315
Okay, this is a curveball
we will need to address.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.584
I've got to announce someone.
What am I supposed to do?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.919
I'm supposed
to walk out on stage

13:40.921 --> 13:43.555
and then keep walking till
I fall off the other side?

13:43.557 --> 13:46.424
My advice... Tom James.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.059
Everyone likes Tom James.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.562
I like Tom James
and I hate everyone.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.497
He has a disabled son, check.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.566
Wounded serving
his country, check.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.601
Is the checklist complete? Yeah.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.102
- No.
- We both say no.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.305
- I got an idea.
- No, you don't. You just think you do.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.073
Go on, Gary. I think
you've got something.

14:02.075 --> 14:06.477
Thank you, Karen.
Why don't we ask Doyle back?

14:07.581 --> 14:08.847
He announced he's leaving.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.982
Okay, does anybody
want a coffee?

14:10.984 --> 14:12.617
Maddox!
That's right, Maddox.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.019
- Minority, military.
- Oh, that's your veep.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.154
Everybody stop having ideas.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.922
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding at all.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.157
Mike, get Maddox.
Find his team.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.227
- On it. I'm on it.
- Ma'am, update on the death row guy.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.895
Sue, forget him.
He's irrelevant.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.864
- He died.
- Oh, finally, right?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.398
It's one less thing
to worry about.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.933
Where are you?
I need you to go

14:28.935 --> 14:31.636
to the convention floor,
Todd, and get Maddox.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.205
Hey, Mike, I hear you guys
are looking for a new veep.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.140
- Uh, it won't be you.
- Oh, no, no, no, God.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.243
I was just gonna suggest
someone... oh, God.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.510
I was gonna suggest Danny Chung.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.045
He seems like
the obvious choice.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.114
He's fit to run.
He's so physically fit.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.985
- <i>( applause )</i> - Thank you so much
for this warmest of welcomes.

14:46.987 --> 14:51.055
You know, it reminds me
of the first time I was here.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.525
- Chungmania.
- <i>( crowd cheering )</i>

14:54.527 --> 14:57.896
How will I ever
live that down, huh?

14:57.898 --> 14:59.530
( laughs )

15:00.233 --> 15:04.469
Well, of course you know why I asked
to speak with you today, George.

15:04.471 --> 15:08.039
Well, I imagine it's not
for my hamburger recipe.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.641
( both laugh )

15:09.643 --> 15:12.043
- Is it good?
- Well, I don't cook.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.279
- That was a joke.
- Right, sure, sure.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.215
Actually, I have
very little sense of taste.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.051
- Hence the tie.
- ( laughs )

15:20.053 --> 15:21.419
Okay. Great.
Great.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.189
Well, I really wanted
to know how you might feel

15:25.191 --> 15:28.359
about being my running mate.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.360
Great.
( laughs )

15:29.362 --> 15:31.596
I mean, my people told me
I should joke around.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.533
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- But I'm a fiercely ambitious man.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.402
And I know how
to get things done.

15:37.404 --> 15:41.339
Not that you don't.
Though people say you don't.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.040
Okay.

15:42.042 --> 15:46.277
Well, we're looking
at all options.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.412
Oh, Ben is calling me.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.514
So I've got to...
He just closed the door,

15:49.516 --> 15:51.149
so I'm gonna have to head out.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.183
But thank you so much.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.719
I appreciate you
coming by, yeah.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.291
Wait a minute, you're telling
me that these are all

16:00.293 --> 16:01.960
the people that I vetted
before I chose Doyle?

16:01.962 --> 16:04.495
- There's so many of them.
- Yeah, you didn't like any of them.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.631
Well, that was then,
and this is not then.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.233
- Olsen polled okay.
- He's got a drinking problem.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.435
He's got a drinking problem.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.203
Yeah, shoe polish
and he never even shared.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.439
Well, we could go
all female, ma'am.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.406
- <i>What?</i>
- Leanne Harris.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.076
Are you trying to blow up
the universe now?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.644
<i>Who's gonna go for
two women on the ticket?</i>

16:19.646 --> 16:23.247
I guess we could all eat pussy
all day long, too, right?

16:23.249 --> 16:25.249
Tom James is a man.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.719
We need a Tom Jamesy
type, you know?

16:27.721 --> 16:30.488
From the South.
And Latino.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.724
Well, he's not
Southern or Latino,

16:32.726 --> 16:34.525
but what about Culverson?

16:34.527 --> 16:35.126
He's 86.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.427
Yeah, that's why
we 86'd him, Mike.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.097
The candidate needs to live up
to and through the election.

16:39.099 --> 16:43.601
- Tom James? - God, why is it hard
to find somebody for this job?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.136
I mean, it is such a great job.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.638
- Such a great job.
- Yeah.

16:47.640 --> 16:52.410
Folks, I am
an Ameri-can

16:52.412 --> 16:53.578
with a merry plan.

16:53.580 --> 16:58.683
I subscribe to a "whistle
while you work" philosophy.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.717
( blows )

16:59.719 --> 17:02.253
If this is supposed to be dead,
it shouldn't be in the center.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.589
- Ma'am. Ma'am. - There's absolutely
no way we're going to be able to...

17:04.590 --> 17:07.325
Ma'am, I don't want to sound
like a broken record,

17:07.327 --> 17:10.161
but Tom James,
Tom James, Tom James.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.730
Okay, stop it.
Just stop it.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.232
Why not?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.434
Amy, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

17:16.435 --> 17:19.203
but you are being
a little irritating.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.538
Selina: <i>Well, maybe
not a little bit.</i>

17:20.540 --> 17:22.773
- Karen: A lot a bit.
- Selina: That's right.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.576
- Then who?
- I don't...

17:25.578 --> 17:26.810
Him?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.080
No! No!
Fuck, no!

17:29.082 --> 17:31.416
Well, he's completely
inept, right?

17:31.418 --> 17:34.152
- But you can make inept work.
- True.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.087
You can say the same
of a potato.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.822
Go get Pierce for me, okay, Ben?

17:37.824 --> 17:40.058
- Okay. Oh...
- We should talk to him.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.427
My head hurts...

17:42.429 --> 17:44.429
from all the wondrous
possibilities.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.431
Selina: <i>Karen, what do
you think of Pierce?</i>

17:46.433 --> 17:49.333
Well, I think there are pros
and cons to every candidate,

17:49.335 --> 17:51.836
so we just need to weigh
up the pros and cons.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.172
Have you been
sent from the future

17:54.174 --> 17:56.140
to destroy me?
'Cause it's working.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.476
"I think that each candidate
has merits and demerits.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.445
And I don't know my left butt
cheek from my right butt cheek,

18:00.447 --> 18:04.649
but I believe in listening to both butt cheeks
and then farting out my asshole mouth."

18:04.651 --> 18:07.151
- Okay.
- It's not even bullshit.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.720
Bullshitting takes talent.
You have none.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.856
You are just a blah, blah,
blah, blah bitch.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.826
Okay, Amy, that is enough.

18:14.828 --> 18:18.229
I have bitten my tongue so long,

18:18.231 --> 18:20.598
it looks like a dog's cushion.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.799
But no more.

18:21.801 --> 18:26.337
You have made it
impossible to do this job.

18:26.339 --> 18:31.409
You have two settings...
No decision and bad decision.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.245
I wouldn't let you run a bath

18:34.247 --> 18:35.546
without having the Coast Guard

18:35.548 --> 18:38.216
and the fire department
standing by,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.118
but yet here you are
running America.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.489
You are the worst thing that
has happened to this country

18:44.491 --> 18:46.624
since food in buckets

18:46.626 --> 18:48.426
and maybe slavery.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.696
I've had enough.
I'm gone.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.334
Well, I guess she's
finished with her little...

18:56.336 --> 18:57.368
Oh, nope.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.870
Look at that, there's more.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.905
- You have achieved nothing.
- Uh-huh.

19:00.907 --> 19:01.906
Apart from one thing.

19:01.908 --> 19:07.512
The fact that you are a woman means
we will have no more women presidents

19:07.514 --> 19:11.649
because we tried one
and she fucking sucked.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.385
Good-bye, ma'am.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.356
<i>( door opens, slams )</i>

19:20.660 --> 19:22.426
Well, that was clearly about me.

19:22.428 --> 19:22.894
( laughs )

19:22.896 --> 19:27.365
She's just one of those women
who resents powerful women.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.536
Man.
( chuckles )

19:37.277 --> 19:39.243
I'm gonna want
to talk to Tom James.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.946
- Okay.
- Selina: <i> Yeah.</i>

19:43.750 --> 19:45.316
- Karen.
- Yes?

19:45.318 --> 19:46.784
What do you think of Tom James?

19:46.786 --> 19:51.656
What do I think of him? I
think there's a lot to think.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.927
- Thank you.
- Of course.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.462
That's 202-337...

19:58.464 --> 19:59.664
Yeah, I know what
Amy's number is.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.533
Just don't make me look too
bad in this one, all right?

20:02.535 --> 20:03.634
Why would I make you look bad?

20:03.636 --> 20:04.869
You're the one that
would make me look bad,

20:04.871 --> 20:06.571
but only after you're done
making yourself look bad.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.675
To be honest, you guys, I think
you're both tremendous, so...

20:10.677 --> 20:12.310
Holy shit.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.444
Amy's gone.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.679
Holy shit, that's insane.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.247
Wow, I'm getting
the same thing, guys.

20:16.249 --> 20:19.717
Maybe we're getting the same text message.
Oh, yeah, we are.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.587
Okay, look, we need a plan.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.223
- Nothing?
- It sounded like you had a plan.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.526
- There's two of you. - That means
we immediately have a fucking plan?

20:28.528 --> 20:31.662
All right, look, bottom line,
we cannot let Mr. Zucchini

20:31.664 --> 20:33.497
the human vegetable
find out about this.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.765
- Why would we tell him?
- I don't know!

20:34.767 --> 20:36.267
Look, just keep
your mouths shut.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.802
Let me do all the
talking, all right?

20:37.804 --> 20:41.539
- <i>Ian.</i>
- Is Amy Brookheimer on the phone?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.874
I'm gonna throw that
over to Jonah.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.611
<i>She was his contact.
They dated for a while.</i>

20:46.613 --> 20:48.579
- So, Jonah?
- Jonah?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.982
Thank you, Dan.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.552
Um...

20:54.554 --> 20:57.555
Amy is too busy right now
at the convention.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.956
She's working at the convention.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.825
- She's working.
- I heard she walked.

21:00.827 --> 21:04.762
- Oh, I hadn't... - Which
I am going to do now.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.997
No, no, Ian, Ian.
Listen to me.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.331
I have a little
black book, okay?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.500
I have numbers the NSA
doesn't even know about.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.969
Have you heard
of Mike McClintock?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.641
Okay, you two,
get out of my office.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.276
- It was a pleasure, sir.
- No.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.645
- Nope.
- No.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.981
Two or three speakers
before he speaks,

21:23.983 --> 21:24.982
so we have about 20 minutes.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.451
- Tom James! Good to see you back.
- Hey, Steve.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.353
You miss me?
I know I missed me.

21:29.355 --> 21:32.523
Hey, Mary, how come
the world changes

21:32.525 --> 21:33.791
and you remain the same?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.693
Cal, heard what you said
about South Korea.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.894
I think you got the wrong Korea.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.597
Marty, loving those
papers on tort reform.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.500
So hard my wife started
to suspect something.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.769
Teresa, you killed it
on "Frontline."

21:44.771 --> 21:48.306
They had to put police tape around
the desk after you were done.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.674
Hey, Natty.
What a cool guy.

21:49.676 --> 21:53.477
You shit ice cubes and you
piss snowflakes, right?

21:53.479 --> 21:55.746
Hey.
What a great convention.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.847
Best one in four years.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.850
- He's on his way up. - Oh, my God, do
you think this is the right decision?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.787
- Yes. - Maybe we should take a
step back and just reassess.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.456
Are you serious? This guy
is an all-American hero.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.691
- Like Evel Knieval.
- Yeah.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.459
- No, better. Lovely Knovley.
- I like that.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.562
Come on, Mike, everyone has skeletons.
Ask any bag man.

22:11.564 --> 22:15.399
- Not this guy. No. - He has one
skeleton. You're looking at her.

22:15.401 --> 22:18.636
- Oh, my God, is that why you
didn't want to chose him? - Mm-hmm.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.671
- Okay, ma'am, show time.
- Okay.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.940
( clears throat )

22:25.545 --> 22:27.578
- Tom: Room service.
- Gary: Oh, God!

22:27.580 --> 22:30.514
- ( laughing )
- Oh, come on, Tom James.

22:30.516 --> 22:31.949
My knight in shining armor.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.086
My damsel in...
Madam President.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.120
You know Mike McClintock.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.488
- Mike, how are you?
- Senator.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.723
- And Kent Davison.
- Senator, a pleasure.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.091
- It's good to see you.
- I'm Karen.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.860
- Gary.
- So can we offer you something to drink?

22:42.862 --> 22:46.097
I could murder and make a
lampshade out of a Manhattan.

22:46.099 --> 22:48.499
- ( all laugh ) - But just a
water will be... thank you.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.802
- Uh-huh. Absolutely.
- Great. Um, excuse me.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.437
I would like something to drink.

22:53.439 --> 22:55.573
- Uh-huh. Water?
- Bourbon, neat.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.707
- Yeah, okay.
- ( stammers )

22:56.709 --> 22:58.476
You need to go
straighten up my room.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.677
- Okay. Hello.
- Hurry up.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.880
- So why don't we just head this way...
- This way?

23:02.882 --> 23:07.084
- so we can have a little
private gabbing time. - Sure.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.619
- Gabbing time.
- Gabbing time.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.688
- <i>Excusez-moi.</i>
- That's all right.

23:10.690 --> 23:11.989
It's fine.
Come.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.859
So you're back in the game, huh?

23:14.861 --> 23:16.127
- I certainly am.
- Wonderful.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.696
- How are you feeling?
- Good. Feels good.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.565
And what about your son Ryan?
How is he doing?

23:21.567 --> 23:23.734
He's on the mend.
He's in a lot of pain.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.071
- Mmm.
- They inserted these pins into his hip.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.572
And it's gonna be a long road.

23:28.574 --> 23:33.778
I don't want to rush you, but I
do need to ask you this, Tom.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.882
Would you join me

23:37.884 --> 23:41.852
on the ticket
as my running mate?

23:43.122 --> 23:46.023
Madam President, I...

23:46.025 --> 23:49.760
I had a feeling
that this was in the wind.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.128
Sure, okay. Yeah.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.598
I'm afraid, with deep regret...

23:54.600 --> 23:56.167
Oh, my God.

23:56.169 --> 23:59.470
That I'm going
to have to accept.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.638
Wait, what?

24:00.640 --> 24:03.107
No, you didn't
just do that to me!

24:03.109 --> 24:05.142
- ( laughing )
- I... I...

24:05.144 --> 24:06.844
- Oh, my God. Guys!
- Guys!

24:06.846 --> 24:09.847
Guys, look what I got!
Look what I got!

24:09.849 --> 24:11.048
- Sounds like good news.
- I got him.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.484
- Welcome aboard, Senator.
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.186
You are so bad.
You are naughty.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.622
I just said, "Would you join me on
the ticket as my running mate?"

24:18.624 --> 24:20.458
Right? And tell
what you just did.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.225
Well, I said,

24:21.227 --> 24:24.228
"Madam President,
it is with deep regret..."

24:24.230 --> 24:26.831
Ah, false expectation.
Set her up.

24:26.833 --> 24:30.000
No, no, no. I said, "It
is with deep regret...

24:30.002 --> 24:32.036
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to accept."

24:32.038 --> 24:35.105
- ( laughing )
- Oh! I can't believe it.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.574
Nicely done.
Very nicely done.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.844
- Can you stand it?
- What? What? What? Come on, what happened?

24:39.846 --> 24:43.080
- Oh, my God, Mike. You are gonna die.
- Listen to this.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.482
This is hilarious.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.616
I just said to Tom,

24:45.618 --> 24:48.252
you know, "Will you join me on
the ticket as my running mate?"

24:48.254 --> 24:50.120
Okay, so then tell
what you just did.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.956
- Again?
- Yeah, definitely tell him.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.858
- Please. Can't wait.
- It's hilarious. Tell him.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.194
Well, I said, "Madam President,
with deep regret..."

24:57.196 --> 24:59.063
No, you didn't say that.
He did not say that.

24:59.065 --> 25:02.032
No, wait, that's not even
the best part. Listen.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.968
Then I said,
"I'm afraid..."

25:03.970 --> 25:06.704
"I'm going to have to
accept." ( laughs )

25:06.706 --> 25:08.839
He accepted.
( laughing )

25:08.841 --> 25:13.010
He accepted.
Oh, it's tremendous.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.279
Welcome to the ticket.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.548
- Thank you, Mike.
- You joker.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.216
Okay, you need to go
get things going, right?

25:19.218 --> 25:21.785
Oh, gosh, yes. It is with
deep regret I must work.

25:21.787 --> 25:24.588
- ( laughing ) - This is
the best announcement

25:24.590 --> 25:26.524
since all those pandas
got pregnant.

25:26.526 --> 25:29.026
- I don't know what that means.
- Toast!

25:29.028 --> 25:31.729
- Deep regret.
- To deep regret.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.663
Indeed, indeed.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.998
- <i>( camera clicking )</i>
- Selina: Yeah.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.233
Well, we have to mark
the moment, don't we?

25:36.235 --> 25:38.235
I'll tell you what, let's scooch
down here just a little bit.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.970
- Photographer: <i> That's good.</i>
- Yeah? There we go.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.705
- Take it quick, quick, quick.
- <i>( camera clicking )</i>

25:41.707 --> 25:43.841
Okay, all right, that's fine.
That's enough.

25:43.843 --> 25:44.775
- Okay.
- Thank you.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.744
I should sit down
with Amy Brookheimer,

25:46.746 --> 25:47.845
see where I fit into the plan.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.848
- Yeah, I had to let her go.
- Yeah, she went crazy.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.818
- Yeah.
- So you don't have a campaign manager?

25:54.820 --> 25:56.153
Oh, no, no.
We do, yeah.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.689
That's all completely
under control.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.725
Our campaign manager is...

26:01.727 --> 26:03.561
- Kent.
- Roger that.

26:03.563 --> 26:07.097
- Well, that was a meeting that
I wasn't at. - That is correct.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.166
The press are excited
about Tom James.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.200
I bet they are!

26:10.202 --> 26:13.671
But we have to tell them who our
new campaign manager is ASAP.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.707
Okay, good. You can
go do that, then.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.309
That's great.

26:18.311 --> 26:20.077
Okay.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.011
Mm-hmm.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.013
Gary: <i>I love your tie.
I love your tie.</i>

26:23.015 --> 26:26.750
- It's so nice.
- Thank you.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.218
- Kent.
- <i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

26:28.220 --> 26:29.286
Do you have
"The New York Times"?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.755
- I can get it for you. Absolutely.
- Good.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.859
So she asked me if I
would sign her breast.

26:35.861 --> 26:38.629
I said, "How about
I sign your arm?"

26:38.631 --> 26:41.765
- Karen. - She said, "That's no
good. Who's gonna see that?"

26:41.767 --> 26:43.701
What do you think about,
you know, the group?

26:43.703 --> 26:47.271
I feel like there are some people who
should be here and some who shouldn't.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.907
- That's exactly how the president feels.
- Oh, good.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.943
Yeah, which is why she's
asked me to let you go.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.278
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.913
Your champagne's been
laced with polonium.

26:55.915 --> 26:59.850
I mean, not really. It's just to
lighten up the moment a little bit.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.020
But she definitely
wants you to go.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.855
So how you feeling?

27:04.857 --> 27:05.956
I don't know what to think.

27:05.958 --> 27:10.294
Precisely. You can just use
that... the door right there.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.830
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:12.832 --> 27:16.734
- <i>( door closes )</i>
- All clear, ma'am.

27:17.103 --> 27:21.372
You don't have to risk your own
life to save another like I did

27:21.374 --> 27:22.973
- to join the hero club.
- <i>( applause )</i>

27:22.975 --> 27:28.245
No, every single day Americans
do something that's heroic.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.381
They live in a democracy.

27:30.383 --> 27:32.750
That's real heroism.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.954
- Selina: Hey, hey, hey. Oh! Thank you.
- Tom: Thank you.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.155
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.791
- Did you guys like that kiss?
- <i>( crowd cheering )</i>

27:40.793 --> 27:41.825
You did?
( laughs )

27:41.827 --> 27:44.261
Well, you know, it's funny because
we actually bumped teeth there.

27:44.263 --> 27:49.433
I guess you guys missed it, but we
have our whole lives to practice that.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.835
- And we will.
- <i>( crowd cheering )</i>

27:51.837 --> 27:53.904
You leave this man alone, okay?

27:53.906 --> 27:55.305
Precious cargo right here.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.907
- Thank you.
- Well, he's my cheerleader.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.943
Yeah, I've got to get him pom-poms.
( laughs )

27:59.945 --> 28:02.680
Thank you all so much again.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.915
Thank you.
America!

28:04.917 --> 28:07.851
Selina: Yes, thank
you, thank you.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.887
Tom: Do you ever
get tired of this?

28:09.889 --> 28:13.057
- Selina: Really tired of it, yeah.
- Oh.
