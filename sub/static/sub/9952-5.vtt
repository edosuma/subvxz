00:01.335 --> 00:02.586
ED: Previously on Haven...

00:02.670 --> 00:05.628
Mr. Brody, are you aware
that if your father died,

00:06.757 --> 00:09.965
you would inherit his popularity
and everyone would automatically like you?

00:10.970 --> 00:13.256
Everyone else in this town
is fawning over me.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.427
Except you.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.755
AUDREY 1: Heâ€™s kind ofajerk.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.095
Duke Crocker.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.643
-This is Evi.
-l'm Duke's...

00:20.855 --> 00:22.265
-Wife?
-I saved your life.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.766
And then you almost ruined it again.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.519
I do not want you sticking around.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.436
EVI: What is it?

00:29.530 --> 00:32.488
Doesn't exactly look like something
that's gonna save my life.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.778
Yeah, but it's gorgeous.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.451
(READING)

00:38.164 --> 00:39.324
"Love conquers all."

00:53.387 --> 00:54.638
PETER: That's no good.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.256
Can't be anyjunk lying around here.

00:58.351 --> 00:59.966
lt'sjust a rehearsal lunch, Peter.

01:00.353 --> 01:04.266
Go easy on the staff. I'm sure everything
will be perfect for the wedding tomorrow.

01:04.357 --> 01:06.143
Maybe we need more staff?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.809
Biggest day of your daughter's life, Ben.
We want Moira happy, right?

01:10.154 --> 01:11.519
I want my daughter happy.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.437
Me, too.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.988
And I want to be a good provider.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.365
It's important to me.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.663
Well, then maybe you should try
providing for her

01:23.000 --> 01:24.285
on your own.

01:24.377 --> 01:28.666
Of course. But having a little state
to start with would sure help.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.498
If I can't take care of her
in the manner she's accustomed,

01:32.677 --> 01:34.042
I'd feel terrible.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.429
Hi.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.535
Can we have this yard spick-and-span
for tomorrow? Thanks.

02:10.089 --> 02:13.798
"Spick-and-span by tomorrow." What a jerk.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.019
This has to be a test, right?

02:35.114 --> 02:36.194
(HORN HONKING)

02:36.282 --> 02:38.193
To see how I'll react
while you run errands on our first date?

02:38.284 --> 02:40.775
It's really only going to take a minute.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.287
Don't stop.
Let's just get this over with, okay?

02:42.413 --> 02:44.278
But why?
Your thing makes everybody like you.

02:44.415 --> 02:45.700
But it doesn't make me like them back.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.076
It'll be fine.

02:48.586 --> 02:52.204
Mr. and Mrs. Crocker. Together.

02:52.298 --> 02:55.290
Actually, we're supplying the wine
for the wedding.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.461
What are you doing here?

02:56.594 --> 02:59.210
Apparently, if your family
donates enough money,

02:59.305 --> 03:01.717
Haven PD will deliver your marriage license.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.013
(LAUGHING)

03:03.100 --> 03:04.135
DUKE: I like him, Parker.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.052
Actually, I was just gonna drop
something off

03:07.146 --> 03:08.431
and we're gonna go out for a drink.

03:08.522 --> 03:12.856
You know, we're not going to be here
for that long. We should all go out.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.142
Yeah. Yeah.

03:14.612 --> 03:17.945
Yeah. We'll see.
You see why I don't want to be here?

03:18.282 --> 03:21.991
Yeah, it must be hard to have beautiful
women just falling all over you

03:22.119 --> 03:23.108
-like that. That's hard.
-Yeah.

03:23.204 --> 03:26.788
Unfortunately, it's not the one I want.
I'm gonna go take a walk, okay?

03:30.127 --> 03:33.790
Peter, this is an enormous mistake.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.463
Uncle Dom, you're talking nonsense.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.211
| just can't buy your scary stories.

03:38.344 --> 03:41.302
I love you,
but I am getting married tomorrow.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.396
-ls this the marriage license?
-Yeah.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.065
All righty. Good to go.

04:00.658 --> 04:01.898
-No.
-No?

04:01.992 --> 04:03.027
I've tried to be nice.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.407
I don't care if she's upset.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.656
I love my daughter too much
to let her marry you.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.662
This thing is off.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.244
You and your family,

04:12.002 --> 04:14.334
get the hell out of my house.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.836

-(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

05:10.394 --> 05:11.895
What the hell?

06:01.820 --> 06:04.436
Come on, I need backup here.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.324
Ugh, the landline's dead.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.042
And what would do something like that?

06:41.819 --> 06:43.775
-|s that her?
-Yep.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.648
Looks like old money.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.990
Maybe she'll buy the box.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.482
Evi, we're not selling it.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.695

she can tell me about this box.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.244
Ms. Keegan.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.418
Would you care to sample the wine
for tomorrow's celebration?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.754
You're not on our catering staff.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.873
Uh, no.

Hi. I'm Evi Crocker.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.216
-No, not this.
-Making you Mr. Crocker?

07:11.599 --> 07:14.932
You're persistent
and you're not welcome here.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.134
Granted.

07:16.228 --> 07:21.063
But I think you may change your mind
when you see what I've brought to show you.

07:26.905 --> 07:27.940
Oh.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.404
How can I help you, Mr. Crocker?

(TWIG SNAPPING)

08:27.675 --> 08:29.961
Don't sneak up on someone
with a gun like that.

08:30.094 --> 08:31.959
I saw you walk into the woods
with your gun drawn.

08:32.096 --> 08:33.211
I thought you might want some help.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.387
You're a marine biologist, not a cop.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.591
Right now, I'm just a guy who's waiting
to go on a date with a cute girl

08:38.769 --> 08:40.555
who apparently is more interested in work.

08:40.646 --> 08:43.979
I'm sorry, Chris,
but there's been a huge fight inside.

08:44.108 --> 08:46.269
The bathroom looks like
it's been ripped apart.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.601
There's been heavy damage
to the outside of the house,

08:48.779 --> 08:51.942
then this drag trail led me here.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.159
Those are Ben Keegan's.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.291
As your friendly neighborhood scientist,
don't touch the goo.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.290
What do you think that is?

09:11.719 --> 09:16.588

from spinal fluid to digestive juice.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.814
You know, I got a buddy
who works at Glacier National.

09:28.986 --> 09:32.820
He says seeing a grizzly's tracks
is worse than seeing the bear.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.690
-And why's that?
-'Cause that means the bear can see you.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.015
Told you he'd still be here, Vince.

We're taking pictures
of the Keegan rehearsal lunch for the paper.

10:05.606 --> 10:09.519
Ben Keegan said that you were gonna
bring the marriage license over.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.100
You can ride with us.

than that van of yours.

Anyway, Parker and Brodyjust left,
they're dropping it off.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.287
Chris Brody? Really?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.705
They're on a date?

10:25.876 --> 10:28.242
Date? No, I don't think Parker's up for dating.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.957
She's a lovely young woman.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.209
So poised and quite a figure.

10:33.425 --> 10:38.044
Stop. Audrey's got way too much
going on to start dating.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.887
Uh-huh, are you sure about that?

10:43.977 --> 10:46.229
Uh, give Ben my regards.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.149
Even back then,
an object like this must have had value.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.988
Correct?

11:02.079 --> 11:05.617
I'm not negotiating, Mr. Crocker.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.330
Neither am I, Ms. Keegan.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.834
I'm not here for money. Simply your wisdom.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.250
Now is there anything
that you can tell me about this box?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.748
Stories? Legends?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.262
Powers?

11:19.471 --> 11:21.587
It's a box, Mr. Crocker.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.637
Exactly what powers could it have?

11:25.769 --> 11:29.353
Ms. Keegan,
your family has been here forever.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.769
You know exactly what I mean.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.274
Well, I've seen work like this before.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.819
Late Colonial.

11:42.286 --> 11:46.620
Regis Glendower or someone from his shop.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.949
Okay, then why was it hidden inside a wall?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.164
Because it's a lovely piece.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.665
I'm sorry.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.957
As far as I know, it's just a box.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.883
It must be worth something.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.836
It is valuable. I'm sure, dear.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.558
You just have to find an interested buyer.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.516
Which is a possibility.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.977
Okay, so I saw Ben and Peter fighting earlier.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.779
I want to go talk to Peter.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.858
Don't mind me. I'm just waiting
for my date to get done with work.

12:26.830 --> 12:27.945
PETER: Well, what are you still doing here?

12:28.040 --> 12:30.156
Actually, I'm looking for Ben Keegan.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.248
I saw you two fighting earlier.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.629
Um, what were you two fighting about?

12:34.713 --> 12:38.376
We were not fighting. Just discussing.
Stupid stuff.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.248
What time
the DJ could put on something bumping.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.255
Seemed like more of an argument than that.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.590
Were you and Dad fighting
about the land again?

12:44.681 --> 12:45.887
PETER: It wasn't a fight.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.510
And it's our future, honey.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.844
Look. We don't have a lot of time.
Can we just cut to the chase, guys?

12:52.689 --> 12:53.895
Oh, sure.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.227
Can we get you anything?

12:56.360 --> 12:58.817
No, no, ljust want to know
what you guys were fighting about.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.020
Please. You're our guest. Stay.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.321
-Actually, I'm not.
-Well, you are now.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.866
Hey, someone brought in a kick ass
Bordeauxjust for me. Let's have some.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.072
That's not what I had in mind.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.368
You know what? Me neither. All right.
Excuse me for a sec, thank you.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.784
All right, listen, this whole Chris Show thing.
This isn't really working out.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.459
Sojust trust me on this, all right?

13:17.089 --> 13:19.125
Sure. Fine. Whatever.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.582
Thank you.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.672
All right. What were you saying about land?

13:24.763 --> 13:28.506
My Aunt Beverly inherited this timber land
when she was a little girl.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.639
And Peter wants my dad to ask her
to give us some of it.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.602
Which really isn't her business.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.772

13:38.276 --> 13:39.652
This is a private event,

13:39.736 --> 13:41.567
and I really don't want to spend it
answering questions.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.239
I understand.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.405
Can you do me a favor?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.787
Can you keep them here?
I need to go talk to somebody.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.747
And watch him.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.791
Can't you pass this on to someone else?

13:57.170 --> 14:01.334
The phones are down.
This is a fluid situation, Chris.

There are ways
that Peter could have hurt Ben

without him necessarily knowing about it.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.273
Peter has his troubles.

But not that kind.

Really? Because I heard you tell him today
you pray that blood won't spill.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.612
l was talking about marrying a cheat.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.614

why don't you go talk to them?

They tried to kill me a long time ago.

The Keegans are trouble.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.843
Not my family. Not the Novellis.

-How did you find him?
-Just heard a noise and I came over here.

15:21.505 --> 15:22.870

AUDREY 1: Dom Novelli had scars like this.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.633
He said the Keegans did it
because they were troubled, but...

15:31.723 --> 15:34.760
This is Ben Keegan.
Are you suggesting he did this to himself?

15:34.851 --> 15:38.844
All right. So he was tied up
and dragged here by someone

is our 20, over.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.255
-What happened?
-Guess.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.931
Be quiet.

16:17.060 --> 16:22.225
Baby Bear, we got some bubbling civilians
in the soup. Can we get an ETA? Over.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.352
Guys, I'll come help you one more time.

and get off the air, right now.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.625
We need to stick together,
and we're going to caravan out.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.836
Chris has gone to check the barn.
I'm gonna go check the house.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.497
Wait. Where is Ben's body?

16:49.009 --> 16:50.340
That's not important right now.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.920
Well, it's important to me.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.593
-To us.
-Why?

16:56.099 --> 16:58.306
Why is it important to you, Peter?

16:58.435 --> 17:00.767
-What?
-Do you have something to hide, maybe?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.015
-No. Of course not.
-What is it?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.100
Did Daddy say no?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.109
Yes, but that's not why I asked.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.736
Okay, right. So you killed him.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.360
You killed him so you could beg
from my Aunt Beverly yourself.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.449
What? How can you even think that?

17:16.620 --> 17:18.952
I knew you were greedy, Peter,
but this is crazy!

17:19.039 --> 17:21.030
Moira, look at me. I didn't kill him.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.582
He's dead and I didn't get anything.
So how's that good for me?

17:24.669 --> 17:26.455
-Oh, God, I hate you.
-That's not what I meant.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.786
-I hate you!
-No, listen to me. Moira.

-Why is that?
-Maybe she's not a romantic.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.007
Maybe somebody broke her heart.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.556
I think she's pissed because she's rich

21:12.689 --> 21:14.429
and she's not allowed
to write her own checks.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.559
What are you talking about?

21:15.692 --> 21:19.025

21:22.532 --> 21:24.864
we had to wait for her nephew, Ben,
to write the check.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.069
Well, at least he did.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.284
Well, maybe she wants the purse back.

21:46.764 --> 21:49.255
Chris, do you think you could distract her?

21:52.270 --> 21:54.761
In case you didn't notice,
I tried to help a couple of times today.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.013
It only made things worse.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.813
Yeah, but wejust need
to keep everybody calm.

21:57.901 --> 22:00.643
No, what we need are chainsaws,
heavy equipment,

22:00.737 --> 22:02.227
maybe some industrial weed killer.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.404
You think the problem is plants?

22:04.491 --> 22:07.153
No. The problems in Haven,
they come from people.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.947
I know
this town has a lot of human aberrations.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.570

But if you want to understand them,

22:12.665 --> 22:14.576
you don't hold their hands.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.620
You observe what they do.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.914
That's science. That's how you learn.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.459
So you think they're a science project?

Like me, because I'm immune to you?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.085
Oh, come on. Don't make this about you.

No, I'm not making it about me, okay?
ljust wanted you to help that poor girl.

we can use to get out of here.

That's how we're going to get out of here.

22:49.035 --> 22:54.655
Seriously. This is like the part in the movie
where you say, "Don't go in there, you idiot."

23:34.872 --> 23:37.659

and we're gone.

No more Haven, no hustle.

23:42.589 --> 23:43.999
No regrets.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.004
It's not that simple.

23:50.179 --> 23:54.764
There's this little town in Mexico
called Barra de Navidad.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.929
We could live on the beach.

23:58.855 --> 24:02.347
The money from the box
would keep us for a few years.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.573
Let me think about it.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.726

24:58.414 --> 24:59.950
can of clam chowder.

25:02.085 --> 25:05.122
-You guys ever see anything like this before?
-DAVE: No.

25:05.505 --> 25:10.215
Though there was a story,
about a couple hundred years ago.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.962
This part of Haven being...

25:12.136 --> 25:13.797
Given up to the wild.

25:14.305 --> 25:17.297
Maybe this is what that meant.

25:17.767 --> 25:23.012
You really don't mind
that Audrey went to this thing with Chris?

25:23.481 --> 25:25.187
Not really any of my business.

25:25.274 --> 25:29.688
Just seems like, maybe,
there's something between you two.

25:29.821 --> 25:31.527
That's not really any of your business.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.776
Well, Haven's full of secrets, son,
but that's not one of them.

25:34.992 --> 25:36.448
She's just going out for a drink.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.448
If she's stuck out there with him,
it's more than that now.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.121
Crises pull people closer.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.990
But you already know that.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.373
If she's even there.

25:45.461 --> 25:47.122
DAVE: We had to be close behind her.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.710
We're stuck here on the only road in and out.

25:52.468 --> 25:53.969
She's still there.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.673
I hope she's okay.

25:55.805 --> 25:57.386
She'll be fine.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.054
Because we're gonna go get her.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.471
How?

26:07.150 --> 26:10.688
Well, maybe your emergency supplies
aren't such a disaster after all.

26:11.362 --> 26:12.477
Oh.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.147
Your nephew controlled all of your money
and now he's dead.

26:17.827 --> 26:20.534
You can either talk to me now
or you can talk to me when you're in jail.

26:20.830 --> 26:24.493
Jail! What makes you think
we're not gonna die right here?

26:29.005 --> 26:31.872
This has happened before, all right?
I want you to tell me about it.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.002
Why would you think such a thing?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.503
I spoke with Dom Novelli.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.256
Dom Novelli is a liar.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.254
Okay, listen, if you keep this up,

26:40.516 --> 26:42.768
we all are going to die here.

26:44.896 --> 26:47.512
It happened when l was in high school.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.064
-There was a fight.
-A fight?

26:50.359 --> 26:52.611
Out on Route 4.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.311
Between Dom and my brothers.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.523
My brothers caught him in a lie.

26:59.535 --> 27:03.778
And then he did things, things like this.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.705
He attacked them.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.249
He killed my baby brother!

27:09.462 --> 27:11.703
Damn it! That's a lie!

27:11.881 --> 27:15.089
Oh, really? Then how did my brother die?

27:15.468 --> 27:16.878
I don't know, Beverly.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.884
I do. You did it!

27:21.724 --> 27:22.884
Audrey!

27:33.569 --> 27:34.729
Don't move.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.284
-I guess I am better than a plan.
-Yeah.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.582
Thanks.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.260
I think I have one now though.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.594
AUDREY 1: I think I've got it. It's the hate.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.222
-That's what's causing all this.
-What?

28:08.312 --> 28:09.347
Ben was fighting with Peter.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.599
Peter was fighting with Moira
when we got chased in here.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.307
And now Beverly and Dom are fighting.
It's the hatred.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.934
The plants use it. They're attracted to it.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.186
But it has to be between the Novellis
and the Keegans.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.397
Yeah, they feed on that.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.072
And then they feed on us.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.320
We need to get the families
to stop hating each other.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.786
That's a good idea, but they've been
at each other's throats for generations.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.997
How are we gonna do that?

28:45.683 --> 28:48.891
Equal and opposite reactions. It's Newton.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.057
I know, ljust don't think
physics is the answer here.

28:52.315 --> 28:55.523
It's not. Love is the answer.

28:56.485 --> 28:57.520
Trust me.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.980
Didn't we start this day
with a bride and groom?

29:02.992 --> 29:05.654
-No.
-Moira, he didn't kill your father.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.201
But what he said aftenNards.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.654
He was only after the land.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.622
But if you could find it in your heart...

29:11.709 --> 29:13.415
I can't. I can't!

29:22.011 --> 29:23.922
This building can't take much more of this.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.178
(SNIFFLING) I'm sorry.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.094
I should have listened to my father.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.176
-And he warned me.
-He warned you about what?

29:31.354 --> 29:32.514
About the Novellis.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.934
He told me how Aunt Beverly's brother died.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.358
Okay, I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.731
MOIRA: Dad took me to
a piece of land we own.

29:41.948 --> 29:45.532
Packham's Point.
Right where it happened years ago.

29:45.618 --> 29:49.577
He just showed me a tree and he said
that this tree killed Beverly's brother.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.912
I thought that it was all nonsense.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.824
Thank you, Moira.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.535
ljust need you to hang tight, okay?

29:57.964 --> 29:59.579
(WEEPING)

30:02.885 --> 30:04.125
I think I know what happened.

30:07.723 --> 30:08.883
You were in love,

30:10.393 --> 30:12.384
in love with Dom.

30:12.561 --> 30:13.596
That's a lie!

30:18.401 --> 30:19.641
Come on, Beverly.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.851
Sometimes people fight

30:21.946 --> 30:25.063
because there are other things
that they don't know how to express.

30:25.741 --> 30:27.948
Dom didn't attack your brothers, Beverly.

30:29.787 --> 30:32.494
Do you think
that he would have done this to himself?

30:35.918 --> 30:38.000
Your brother lied to you.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.791
Why? Why would he lie to me?

30:40.923 --> 30:44.165
The same reason that
Peter wants to marry Moira, for your money.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.751
-What?
-He was afraid that if you got married,

30:46.846 --> 30:50.464
that he would lose control of the property,
and he would lose control of you.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.639
Why were you meeting her that day?

30:56.605 --> 30:58.266
We were eloping.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.604
You mean you were really there?

31:03.696 --> 31:05.357
You weren't running away?

31:05.823 --> 31:07.814
I went out to meet you.

31:08.868 --> 31:11.860
But somehow, your brothers found out
about it

31:12.872 --> 31:14.954
and tried to run me off.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.953
They attacked me.

31:22.006 --> 31:25.089
Or I should say that we were all attacked.

31:25.176 --> 31:26.632
Because we were fighting.

31:29.805 --> 31:33.138
I tried to save your baby brother, Bevi.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.977
But that damn tree just hit him so hard.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.976
Dom, I'm so sorry.

31:48.491 --> 31:50.322
I've done it all wrong.

31:50.743 --> 31:53.325
But now you have the chance to do it right.

31:55.164 --> 31:58.327
We think that your love might be able
to push the plants back. That is if...

32:00.336 --> 32:02.668
If you have any left for one another.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.207
(SIGHS) Never went away.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.840
I've missed you so much.

32:21.023 --> 32:24.356
Okay, I need everybody to stay close
to Dom and Beverly.

32:24.568 --> 32:25.683
And if my theory is correct,

32:25.778 --> 32:29.612
-they'|| part the plants and we can go through.
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:29.698 --> 32:31.154
NATHAN: Let me in.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.028
Parker, let me in.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.539
Nathan.

32:38.207 --> 32:40.289
Are you okay? How did you get here?

32:40.584 --> 32:41.744
This.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.369
Pushed them back enough to get by.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.545
I got Vince and Dave out,
and I came back for you.

32:47.383 --> 32:50.591
But it took two flares to get here,
I've only got one left, so...

32:50.719 --> 32:52.584
Nathan, you know what?

32:55.224 --> 32:56.259
I think we got it.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.667
NATHAN: So, wait.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.962
This trouble goes back to twins?

34:14.053 --> 34:19.264
The Novellis had twins generations back,
and each twin got half the family curse.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.966
And then one of the twins
married into the Keegans.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.764
So now you need someone from each side
to make the trouble happen?

34:25.189 --> 34:26.304
Like epoxy.

34:26.482 --> 34:27.517
Or peanut butter cups.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.140
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

34:30.986 --> 34:32.066
Thanks, guys.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.074
I have some work to do.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.613
Good.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.033
Good night.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.160
Oh.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.211
You okay, Nate?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.707
Just busy.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.259
About Audrey, don't wait too long.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.434
Good night.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.691
I can't leave.

36:00.284 --> 36:01.490
You don't understand.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.409
It's not about you.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.284
No, I understand just fine.

36:11.587 --> 36:12.997
It's the blonde cop.

36:13.088 --> 36:14.123
It's not about Audrey.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.920
No, please don't con me.

36:16.050 --> 36:18.006
-|t's not her.
-|'ve seen the way you look at her.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.378
It's not her.

36:19.470 --> 36:21.131
Then what is it?

36:22.056 --> 36:23.967
Why are you even here?

36:26.226 --> 36:27.932
It's my dad, okay?

36:29.813 --> 36:32.429
I'm back because he made me promise
that I would come back here

36:32.524 --> 36:34.856
if The Troubles ever returned.

36:35.444 --> 36:38.231
-Why?
-That's a fantastic question.

36:38.739 --> 36:41.071
The old bastard made me swear.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.949
And then,

36:45.037 --> 36:46.322
he died.

36:47.247 --> 36:50.205
Telling me why? Well, that never happened.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.999
I am in this up to my eyes.

36:58.884 --> 37:02.468
My dad never seemed to care about
anything else I did.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.341
But this...

37:08.394 --> 37:10.134
I don't know why.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.846
But I have to find out.

37:16.485 --> 37:18.521
So I can't go with you.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.565
I'm sorry.

37:50.644 --> 37:52.555
-MAN: Hello.
-Yeah, it's me.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.061
His dad never told him.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.640
Then we have to keep pushing him.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.082
Hi.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.916
Do you like them?

38:21.049 --> 38:22.585
They seem to like you.

38:22.885 --> 38:24.091
(LAUGHS)

38:24.761 --> 38:26.422
That's funny.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.596
Let me just go ahead
and put these in some water, okay?

38:29.683 --> 38:30.843
Yeah.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.346
(CHUCKLES)

38:34.438 --> 38:36.019
-Nice.
-Thanks.

38:36.482 --> 38:37.642
Wine?

38:38.108 --> 38:39.268
Sure.

38:40.819 --> 38:44.107
This place is a lot nicer
than where we were gonna go.

38:50.704 --> 38:51.910
What?

38:54.333 --> 38:55.493
This.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.211
It's nice.

38:59.630 --> 39:00.836
I like it.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.709
-All of it.
-Thanks.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.337
Your immunity to me,

39:12.226 --> 39:15.810
that's not why I asked you out.

39:16.813 --> 39:18.474
It's really not.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.439
Okay, so why did you, really?

39:30.661 --> 39:32.026
l observe.

39:32.955 --> 39:35.867
That's what I do. It's what I've always done.

39:35.958 --> 39:39.450
It annoys people, but that's what I do.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.379
And here's what I've observed about you,
Audrey Parker,

39:45.217 --> 39:47.003
you are

39:48.428 --> 39:49.713
amazing.

39:52.516 --> 39:53.847
The way you pitched those flowers,

39:53.934 --> 39:58.769
the way you threw together this dinner
after we had the worst date ever.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.231
That's really not that amazing.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.936
You got two people who've hated
each other for over 50 years

40:07.030 --> 40:09.237
to fall in love again today.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.410
I'd say that's pretty amazing.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.612
But what's more amazing

40:18.542 --> 40:21.955
is that you can make a cynical jackass
like me

40:22.045 --> 40:25.082
believe that there are people in this world
worth knowing.

40:27.134 --> 40:29.876
Well, one, anyway.

40:34.516 --> 40:36.757
I want you, Audrey, because...

40:39.646 --> 40:41.432
Because you're you.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.516
(VIBRATING)
