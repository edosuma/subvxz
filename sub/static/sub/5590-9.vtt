No pictures tonight.

Gabriella: Country is not ready
for a gay star.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.703
Rayna: Beautiful.
I'm so excited.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.538
You killed it!

00:08.540 --> 00:10.640
You exhaust me.
Son, tell me
what you do need.

00:10.642 --> 00:12.141
I need a dad who gives a crap
about telling the truth.

00:12.143 --> 00:13.442
Can you talk?

00:13.444 --> 00:15.710
Now is not --
not a real good time.

00:15.712 --> 00:18.612
It might be time for y'all to
sign at highway 65, as a team.

00:18.614 --> 00:19.846
Daphne:
Why aren't you excited?

00:19.848 --> 00:21.781
The only reason
she signed us at all

00:21.783 --> 00:23.382
Is to keep me
under her control.

00:23.384 --> 00:24.950
This one was written
by a friend of mine.

00:24.952 --> 00:27.285
There was a publisher
in the audience tonight --

00:27.287 --> 00:30.321
Said whoever wrote that song
should give him a call.

Uh, just letting you know we're
about to roll into charlotte.

Oh, thanks.

01:43.048 --> 01:44.714
Working on
some new material?

01:44.716 --> 01:46.215
Yeah. I got a lot of time
on my hands.

01:46.217 --> 01:47.382
I figured I'd try
and be productive.

01:47.384 --> 01:49.851
Oh. Cool.
Can't wait to hear it.

01:49.853 --> 01:52.420
Them. There's seven
of them so far.

01:52.422 --> 01:55.022
S-seven songs?
Mm-hmm.

01:55.024 --> 01:57.424
Wow.
That's, uh, that's great.

01:57.426 --> 01:59.092
Thanks.

01:59.094 --> 02:00.460
Shep: Okay, everybody!
Listen up.

02:00.462 --> 02:02.795
There was a kitchen fire
at the venue.

02:02.797 --> 02:04.229
The show tonight
is canceled.

02:04.231 --> 02:05.763
Man: Dang.

02:05.765 --> 02:07.364
It should be back up and running
by tomorrow night's show,

02:07.366 --> 02:08.398
But you guys
have some time off.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.532
[ scattered sighs of relief ]

02:09.534 --> 02:11.567
Free day in charlotte --
that's cool.

02:11.569 --> 02:12.768
Yeah, great.

02:12.770 --> 02:15.203
Would you mind dropping me
at the airport?

02:15.205 --> 02:18.272
If I got 24 hours, I'd really
like to spend them in nashville.

02:18.274 --> 02:20.207
[ cellphone chimes ]

02:20.209 --> 02:21.875
Kind of early for a crisis,
isn't it?

02:21.877 --> 02:23.810
Not when you're working
with markus keen.

02:23.812 --> 02:27.113
He just decided to scrap a song
that he<i> loved</i> yesterday.

02:27.115 --> 02:28.781
Wait, on the album that
you're releasing next week?

02:28.783 --> 02:30.048
Yes. I mean,
the record was done.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.282
[ cellphone chimes ]

02:31.284 --> 02:33.617
Now we've got to find a new song
and get it recorded.

02:33.619 --> 02:35.452
Of course he's at the studio
already waiting for me.

02:35.454 --> 02:36.820
Well, you go on ahead,
all right?

02:36.822 --> 02:38.154
I will bring the girls
to school.

02:38.156 --> 02:39.255
Thank you, baby.
I appreciate it.

02:39.257 --> 02:40.322
Mm.

02:40.324 --> 02:41.823
When am I gonna get
to see you now?

02:41.825 --> 02:43.491
I don't know, you know?

02:43.493 --> 02:46.627
I mean, knowing this guy,
it's gonna be a long day.

02:46.629 --> 02:47.728
[ cellphone rings ]
yeah.

02:47.730 --> 02:48.895
[ scoffs ] good lord.

02:48.897 --> 02:50.129
Hey, markus.

02:50.131 --> 02:51.897
Yeah. I know.
I'm on my way.

02:51.899 --> 02:53.798
How's that bacon, son?

02:53.800 --> 02:56.233
It's bacon.

02:56.235 --> 02:57.801
Well, you need to eat.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.603
I haven't seen you
have a full meal in days.

03:00.605 --> 03:02.471
I just don't have
much of an appetite.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.339
For food or conversation,
turns out.

03:04.341 --> 03:06.174
So, colt,
your dad tells me

03:06.176 --> 03:08.409
That you're pretty big
into hip hop.

03:09.945 --> 03:12.011
You know that's where I got
my start in branding.

03:12.013 --> 03:13.746
Still can't get used
to that word.

03:13.748 --> 03:15.614
Where I'm from, uh,

03:15.616 --> 03:18.183
Branding meant taking
a hot poker to a cow.

No phone
at the table, please.

Hey.
What are you doing?

03:28.827 --> 03:30.593
I'm just getting ready
for school.

03:30.595 --> 03:33.262
You know, not everyone gets
to go on tour like you.

03:33.264 --> 03:35.197
[ chuckles ] well, it's more
like being held hostage

03:35.199 --> 03:37.132
By my dad and his
consultant girlfriend.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.267
I'm just happy
I finally get to come home.

03:39.269 --> 03:41.335
What have you been up to?
Nothing.

03:41.337 --> 03:42.803
Mom signed us to her label,

03:42.805 --> 03:44.638
Yet the only thing
she has planned

03:44.640 --> 03:46.006
Is some dumb photo shoot.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.541
Yeah.
Hypocrite parents suck.

03:48.543 --> 03:50.509
[ sighs ]
is something wrong?

03:50.511 --> 03:51.376
No, why?

03:51.378 --> 03:52.944
I don't know.

03:52.946 --> 03:55.379
You just seem different
since I saw you last.

03:55.381 --> 03:57.647
What, you think
I don't love you?

03:57.649 --> 03:59.882
Hey, you're the only thing
that matters to me anymore.

03:59.884 --> 04:01.617
And if I sound like I'm mad,

04:01.619 --> 04:03.719
Trust me, it's got nothing
to do with you.

04:03.721 --> 04:04.953
Then what is it?

04:04.955 --> 04:07.622
I need to call ford back
later today.

04:07.624 --> 04:10.524
It's nothing I can
really talk about.

04:10.526 --> 04:13.226
Look at him chirping away
on that phone

04:13.228 --> 04:17.496
When all I get are short answers
and cold stares.

04:17.498 --> 04:20.499
Luke, it was a terrible thing
that happened in atlanta,

04:20.501 --> 04:22.968
But we're all coming out
of the other side of it.

04:22.970 --> 04:24.302
Juliette's in treatment,

04:24.304 --> 04:26.537
We finally found
a new c.E.O.,

04:26.539 --> 04:29.139
All of our investors are
locked in for the brand launch,

04:29.141 --> 04:31.574
And you are gonna be on the
cover of<i> forbes</i> magazine.

04:31.576 --> 04:34.543
We scheduled a photo shoot for
it out by the ranch, by the way.

04:34.545 --> 04:36.578
Luke.

04:36.580 --> 04:41.415
Fine, just, uh, don't fill up
the whole break with business.

04:41.417 --> 04:45.218

serious one-on-one time.

from the airport.

I know you said
you were busy today,

lunch together

In the cafeteria
or something.

through lunch today.

due any minute.

Sorry, I -- when you said
you were coming,

I could be home earlier.

to be spontaneous.

of songwriters.

[ cork pops ]

05:32.254 --> 05:34.721
One song at the bluebird could
land me a publishing deal.

05:34.723 --> 05:35.755
It's a hell of a song.

05:35.757 --> 05:37.289
In fact,
we took the liberty

05:37.291 --> 05:39.257
Of sending it out
to a few select artists.

05:39.259 --> 05:40.858
One of them's already
put a hold on it.

Mm-hmm.

can write together.

gonna tell me who it is,

gonna make me guess?

of how much I love playing.

on a big draw.

has the perfect song

a little country cred?

I never even thought
about that.
Right?

Probably 'cause we have,
I don't know,

Maybe a little different
sensibilities.

07:36.274 --> 07:38.007
You wrote a bunch
of rayna's songs,

Which means we obviously have
the same taste in<i> some</i> things.

07:39.944 --> 07:41.710
I-I got to be honest, ray.

never gonna make the deadline

something different.

and if I like one,

tonight, lay it down tomorrow.

08:00.025 --> 08:01.190
This is gonna be great.

08:01.192 --> 08:02.357
[ laughs ]

08:02.359 --> 08:05.426
¶¶

08:13.535 --> 08:15.134
I hope you saved one
for me,

08:15.136 --> 08:17.402
'cause I got something
to celebrate.

08:17.404 --> 08:19.570
I am playing a show
at the 5 spot tomorrow.

08:19.572 --> 08:21.738
Finally back
to playing real music

08:21.740 --> 08:23.506
Instead of
those lame jingles.

08:23.508 --> 08:24.874
Oh, good for you.

08:24.876 --> 08:26.976
How'd it go
at the publishing house?

08:26.978 --> 08:29.578
Wade cole put
my song on hold --

08:29.580 --> 08:30.645
Wants to meet tomorrow

08:30.647 --> 08:32.380
And talk more
about writing together.

08:32.382 --> 08:34.582
What am I missing here?

08:34.584 --> 08:37.017
I mean [chuckles] you're working
with a big artist like that

08:37.019 --> 08:38.818
And you're not even happy
about it?

08:38.820 --> 08:42.188
I met him at juliette's
launch party, after I came out.

08:42.190 --> 08:43.556
I mean,
he was friendly at first,

08:43.557 --> 08:44.923
But the minute a camera
was pointed our way,

08:44.926 --> 08:46.425
He didn't want anything
to do with me.

08:46.427 --> 08:49.194
Maybe he just didn't want
his picture taken.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.429
Don't you think you should
at least give the guy

08:51.431 --> 08:53.097
The benefit of
the doubt?

08:54.366 --> 08:56.032
[<i> hip hop music plays</i> ]

08:56.034 --> 08:57.767
Hey, bud.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.435
Can we talk?

08:59.437 --> 09:02.671
[ music continues ]

09:02.673 --> 09:04.506
[ music stops ]

09:04.508 --> 09:06.007
Fine, I'll talk.

09:08.544 --> 09:11.444
I miss you...
I miss us.

09:11.446 --> 09:15.447
I miss...Watching football
and playing video games.

09:15.449 --> 09:17.682
What do you want
from me, dad?

09:17.684 --> 09:20.718
Look, we got the next
couple weeks off.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.353
I think you and I ought to spend
some quality time together --

09:23.355 --> 09:25.054
None of this
being-on-the-road stuff,

09:25.056 --> 09:27.289
Just [inhales] you know,
being at home,

09:27.291 --> 09:29.124
Just the two of us.

09:29.126 --> 09:31.259
I already made plans
with maddie.

09:31.261 --> 09:34.428
Yeah, I get it.
Um, but maddie can wait.

09:34.430 --> 09:35.796
This is important, too.

09:35.798 --> 09:37.664
More important than what
you're doing with her?

09:40.635 --> 09:42.868
Of course, son.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.869
Way more important
than that.

09:46.305 --> 09:47.470
Fine.

09:47.472 --> 09:50.205
Can I put these
back on now?

09:52.442 --> 09:54.074
Yes, you may, son.

09:54.076 --> 09:56.543
Yes, you may.

09:59.614 --> 10:01.647
Hey.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.115
One of the guys mapped out
a pub crawl for us.

10:03.117 --> 10:04.216
You want to come?

10:04.218 --> 10:06.418
Uh, I-I think I'm just
gonna stay in tonight.

10:06.420 --> 10:07.752
Really? Why?

10:07.754 --> 10:10.121
Good chance to get back into
the writing thing, you know?

10:10.123 --> 10:12.289
Got a couple songs I want
to get down on paper.

10:12.291 --> 10:14.090
Oh, right,
'cause scarlett wrote seven.

10:14.092 --> 10:15.758
Did she make
an announcement now?

10:15.760 --> 10:17.859
No.
You're just transparent.

10:19.762 --> 10:21.728
But still cute.

10:21.730 --> 10:24.230
Have fun -- can't wait to hear
what you come up with.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.599
Come on, guys.

10:26.601 --> 10:28.167
All right.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.568
Man: Later, dude.
Later.

10:31.638 --> 10:35.505
I'm sorry. I assumed this would
be something you'd like to do.

10:35.507 --> 10:36.806
Musically,
I actually think

10:36.808 --> 10:38.274
You and markus have a lot
in common.

10:38.276 --> 10:39.275
Well, that's funny,

10:39.277 --> 10:41.143
'cause my first impression
of the guy

10:41.145 --> 10:43.478
Is, uh, he's an arrogant
son of a bitch.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.413
Little bit.
[ laughs ]
well, you're not wrong.

10:45.415 --> 10:46.280
[ laughs ]
but he gets better.

10:46.282 --> 10:47.447
He does.

10:47.449 --> 10:48.414
Well, the only reason

10:48.416 --> 10:49.615
I'm putting up
with any of this

10:49.617 --> 10:50.449
Is because I know how much
this album means to you.

10:50.451 --> 10:51.783
Well, it's exciting.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.484
It's the first thing
I've ever produced.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.285
Maddie: Hi, markus.
I love the idea of you
having a song on it.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.420
Markus: Hey, it's the very
gifted maddie conrad!
I like that, too.

10:57.422 --> 10:58.487
No, you're just
saying that.

10:58.489 --> 10:59.788
No, I'm not just
saying that.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.422
I'm trying to tell maddie
that her talent

11:01.424 --> 11:02.790
Is what got her signed
to highway 65.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.024
It's true.
Hey, welcome.

11:04.026 --> 11:05.592
Hey, thank you.

11:05.594 --> 11:07.160
And you know,
on that note,

11:07.162 --> 11:09.529
You and your sister need to
start writing some songs.

11:09.531 --> 11:11.163
Y'all should finish up that one
about the clouds.

11:11.165 --> 11:12.497
I thought that was
really, uh, going somewhere.

11:12.499 --> 11:14.098
That was daphne.
Oh.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.333
And it was lame.

11:16.335 --> 11:18.968
Markus: [ laughs ]
teenager.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.602
Yeah.
Can I get you something
to drink?
No, I'm fine.

11:20.604 --> 11:22.136
I-I want to tell you guys,
though --

11:22.138 --> 11:23.437
I spent the entire day
at grimey's,

11:23.439 --> 11:24.304
Going through the bins,

11:24.306 --> 11:25.772
And I now own everything

11:25.774 --> 11:27.640
That this guy's
ever made on vinyl.

11:27.642 --> 11:29.642
Yes,<i> you,</i> dude.

11:29.644 --> 11:31.510
I'm telling you, "live
at the broken spoke" in '90,

11:31.512 --> 11:33.712
That should be a requirement
for every baby musician.

11:33.714 --> 11:35.847
That's very kind, but you
don't got to blow smoke.

11:35.849 --> 11:37.315
I'm not!
Dude, I'm serious.

11:37.317 --> 11:39.717
Come on, please --
take a compliment, man.

11:39.719 --> 11:41.351
Really, much respect.

11:43.054 --> 11:45.187
Thank you.
You're welcome.

11:45.189 --> 11:46.021
And also,
I listened to your demos.

11:46.023 --> 11:47.322
That song
[snaps fingers] um,

11:47.324 --> 11:48.790
"don't make 'em
like you no more"?
Mm-hmm.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.491
How did that
never get cut?

11:50.493 --> 11:53.327
It is a mystery.
Rayna:
That is such a great song.

11:53.329 --> 11:55.195
Don't you think that'd be
a perfect song for the record?

11:55.197 --> 11:56.462
Yes, that's what
I'm saying.

11:56.464 --> 11:58.130
And -- and I know the demo
is acoustic,

11:58.132 --> 11:59.731
But I'm kind of hearing
like this --

11:59.733 --> 12:02.333
This motown bassline,
you know?

12:02.335 --> 12:03.867
No?

12:03.869 --> 12:05.401
[ laughs ]
well, actually, yes.

12:05.403 --> 12:08.170
That is something we had
in mind then.
[ chuckles ]

12:08.172 --> 12:11.105
Fellas, I think we got
ourselves a song.

12:12.208 --> 12:13.373
[ chuckles ]

12:15.210 --> 12:16.876
So, what do you think?

12:16.878 --> 12:18.377
About what?

12:18.379 --> 12:20.212
My outfit.
Do you like it?

12:20.214 --> 12:21.546
Why does it matter?

12:21.548 --> 12:23.548
Mom wants us to match
for that press kit thingy.

12:23.550 --> 12:25.149
And I really like
this color.

12:25.151 --> 12:26.884
What, you're joking,
right?

12:26.886 --> 12:29.353
Those pictures might be used
for an e.P. Cover...

12:29.355 --> 12:31.188
If she ever
lets us do one.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.722
There's no way
you're wearing that.

12:32.724 --> 12:34.090
What's wrong with this?

12:34.092 --> 12:37.026
Nothing, if you're gonna be
on the cover of a kidz bop cd.

12:37.028 --> 12:40.495
Do you want to be taken
seriously or not?

12:40.497 --> 12:42.497
Great sesh.

12:42.499 --> 12:45.032
That flamenco lick you played
really screams "tacos."

12:45.034 --> 12:48.035
Yeah, well, I had to brush up
on my finger picking for it.

12:48.037 --> 12:49.403
[ sighs ]
thanks for the gig.

12:49.405 --> 12:51.971
No, man. Thank you.
You killed it.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.007
Wait a second.

12:55.009 --> 12:57.342
Yeah, I thought the quote
was for twice this.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.410
Well, it was,
but we pay hourly.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.613
You ended up tracking the cues
in half the time we anticipated.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.048
So I get penalized for that?
[ scoffs ]

13:05.050 --> 13:07.183
Come on, bro.
It's not like you or your wife

13:07.185 --> 13:08.417
Need jingle money, right?

13:08.419 --> 13:10.619
No, it's just, uh, I enjoy
working, you know?

13:10.621 --> 13:12.187
And, uh,
I'd like to do more.

13:12.189 --> 13:14.222
You got any more spots
coming up?

13:14.224 --> 13:16.090
You know the business,
brother -- unpredictable.

13:16.092 --> 13:19.559
Look, I'll call you
when something does.

13:19.561 --> 13:21.960
¶¶

13:24.798 --> 13:27.899
¶ do you really know? ¶

13:27.901 --> 13:30.968
¶ 'cause if you really
love somebody ¶

13:30.970 --> 13:32.469
You're home!
[ giggles ]

13:32.471 --> 13:35.805
Hey! Wow.
I am so sorry I'm late.

13:35.807 --> 13:39.408
I don't care.
I missed you so much.

13:39.410 --> 13:40.809
Me too.

13:40.811 --> 13:42.577
Can we stay in
and order out?

13:42.579 --> 13:44.745
Um...Okay.
But, um...

13:44.747 --> 13:47.547
What's the matter?

13:47.549 --> 13:51.217
[ sighs ] it's nothing.
It's been a long day.

13:51.219 --> 13:53.786
I could just use a second
to unwind.

13:53.788 --> 13:55.420
Sure.

13:55.422 --> 13:58.755
Okay. And just take a quick
shower and wake myself up a bit?

13:58.757 --> 14:00.456
Yeah.

14:00.458 --> 14:01.990
Okay. Thanks.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.296
Key of g. Sure.
Markus: Yep.
Deacon: I think so.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.764
Yeah, it's a real
sweet spot --

14:10.766 --> 14:12.432
Your voice is real soulful
right there.
Oh, thanks, man.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.100
And when we add that
little slinky back beat

14:14.102 --> 14:15.901
That you came up with
[chuckles] dude.

14:15.903 --> 14:17.502
And I'm hearing some really
great little harmonies

14:17.504 --> 14:19.170
All the way throughout.

14:19.172 --> 14:20.271
Oh, yeah. We can work on that
tonight if you want.
Yeah.

14:20.273 --> 14:22.740
Ah, I got to, um...
I got to take off.

14:22.742 --> 14:24.908
But tomorrow we'll lay
this bad boy down, right?

14:24.910 --> 14:26.075
Yeah. We'll see you
in the studio.

14:26.077 --> 14:27.076
All right.
I'll see you.

14:27.078 --> 14:28.444
And, hey, you're coming,
too, right?

14:28.446 --> 14:29.845
Y'all want me there.

14:29.847 --> 14:31.513
Of course
I want you there.

14:31.515 --> 14:33.748
Look at us --
the dream team.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.149
[ laughs ]
see you all tomorrow.

14:35.151 --> 14:37.484
Night, markus.
[ door closes ]

14:37.486 --> 14:39.252
So, how's that?

14:39.254 --> 14:41.988
I don't know.

14:41.990 --> 14:43.589
Guy's got good ideas,

14:43.591 --> 14:46.124
Respectful,
can sing his ass off.

14:46.126 --> 14:47.458
Yeah.

14:47.460 --> 14:50.294
Honestly, I wanted to hate him,
and I don't, so...

14:50.296 --> 14:51.295
So you like him?

14:51.297 --> 14:52.262
[ laughs ]

14:52.264 --> 14:54.364
I like working with him.

15:03.374 --> 15:05.340
Good to be home, isn't it?

15:07.210 --> 15:09.143
Yeah.

15:09.145 --> 15:12.946
I remember the first time
I brought you out here.

15:12.948 --> 15:14.547
You were about
6 or 7 years old,

15:14.549 --> 15:16.515
And you got your lip snagged
on a hook somehow.

15:16.517 --> 15:17.482
Remember that?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.851
Scared the hell out of me.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.319
I rushed to
the emergency room,

15:21.321 --> 15:23.788
But you were cool as a cucumber
the whole time.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.457
What was it you kept telling
everybody in the waiting room?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.392
[ chuckles ]
"my dad caught me fishing."

15:28.394 --> 15:29.393
[ laughs ]

15:29.395 --> 15:31.294
[ chuckles ]

15:35.700 --> 15:37.433
I'm sorry, you know.

15:39.503 --> 15:43.070
For not doing this
as much as we should have.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.806
Me too.

15:45.808 --> 15:48.975
Gabriella: Oh, hey.
There you are.

15:48.977 --> 15:50.977
The groundskeeper told me
you were down here.

15:50.979 --> 15:52.712
[ camera shutter clicks ]
gabriella, what's going on?

15:52.714 --> 15:55.014
It's the<i> forbes</i> shoot?

15:55.016 --> 15:56.648
Don't you remember?
I told you about it yesterday.

15:56.650 --> 15:58.149
Man:
We good to get started?

15:58.151 --> 15:59.884
It's the perfect setting
for some candids.

15:59.886 --> 16:01.418
[ camera shutter clicking ]

16:01.420 --> 16:04.053
Son, I had no idea.

16:04.055 --> 16:05.754
Right.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.255
[ clicking continues ]

16:14.863 --> 16:16.829
Suddenly, there's all these cows
all over the road.

16:16.831 --> 16:18.530
And the bus driver swerved
so he didn't one,

16:18.532 --> 16:20.064
And shep came flying
out of his bunk

16:20.066 --> 16:21.565
Wearing nothing but a thong.
[ laughs ]

16:21.567 --> 16:23.767
Wait, but a-aren't
there seatbelts

16:23.769 --> 16:25.702
In that thing
to keep you secure?

16:25.704 --> 16:27.370
Not really.

16:27.372 --> 16:29.939
I-it's -- sorry,
wasn't the point.

16:29.941 --> 16:31.407
Um, never mind.
Tell me about you.

16:31.409 --> 16:32.508
What you been doing?

16:32.510 --> 16:35.377
Um...

16:35.379 --> 16:38.279
Well, I guess, uh,

16:38.281 --> 16:41.181
Just trying to get this
clinical trial pushed through,

16:41.183 --> 16:43.049
But there's so much
red tape involved

16:43.051 --> 16:45.051
Between pitching
to the review board

16:45.053 --> 16:46.919
And the nci
to get approval.

16:46.921 --> 16:50.422
And then you know how --
um...

16:50.424 --> 16:53.224
[ chuckles ] sorry. This is
probably really boring to you.

16:53.226 --> 16:55.359
No, it's not.
Mnh-mnh.

16:57.463 --> 17:01.097
So, uh, when is your...

17:01.099 --> 17:02.531
Thing later?

17:02.533 --> 17:05.734
Sound check? 6:00.

17:05.736 --> 17:07.469
Got to leave by 3:00
to get there.

17:07.471 --> 17:10.305
Well, I'll try
to clear my calendar

17:10.307 --> 17:11.906
So that we can at least
have some time

17:11.908 --> 17:14.074
To go for a walk
before you go.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.442
Okay.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.444
Sooner I get to work,

17:18.446 --> 17:20.145
Sooner I can come back
and we can go for that walk.

17:20.147 --> 17:22.447
So...

17:22.449 --> 17:23.881
I'm gonna go to work.

[ door opens ]

17:33.458 --> 17:34.757
Hey.
What are you doing here?

17:34.759 --> 17:36.158
I forgot this
in my car yesterday.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.659
I know sometimes
it's the only thing

17:37.661 --> 17:39.160
That could keep cadence
from crying,

17:39.162 --> 17:40.261
So I didn't want you to be
without it.

17:40.263 --> 17:42.263
Thanks.

17:42.265 --> 17:44.265
You all right?

17:44.267 --> 17:47.568
[ sighs ]
honestly, no.

17:47.570 --> 17:49.336
I got a pile of bills here,

17:49.338 --> 17:52.505
And I'm just not making enough
to cover them.

17:52.507 --> 17:55.574
You know, I, uh...

17:55.576 --> 17:57.409
I have access to
juliette's accounts.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.277
If you really need something,
I can --

17:59.279 --> 18:01.512
I'm not taking her money.
But it's for cadence --

18:01.514 --> 18:04.481
No. Not a dime.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.583
Then I'll loan it to you.
Just until you get more work.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.684
[ sighs ] em, look --

18:07.686 --> 18:10.920
I really appreciate
the offer, but...

18:10.922 --> 18:14.456
I can't take it
from you either.

for my own child.

18:19.328 --> 18:23.862
Listen, I know you're watching
cadence tonight during my set,

18:23.864 --> 18:25.530
But can you watch her now
for a little while?

18:25.532 --> 18:28.099
Sure.
Where you going?

Great! [ scoffs ]

18:51.854 --> 18:55.855
Wow. Looks like you were
very productive.

18:55.857 --> 18:58.157

what I got?

All right.

[ strums guitar ]

Well, that's all I got.

Three notes. All night.
You want to hear it again?

19:07.500 --> 19:10.968
No -- I think
I get the gist of it.

19:10.970 --> 19:13.136
Oh, and I didn't get
any lyrics either,

19:13.138 --> 19:15.905
But, uh, I did get some
pretty cool doodles

19:15.907 --> 19:17.473
If you're interested.

have crazy eyes right now.

out of here.

Let's go.

You need to come out
and have some fun.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.585
Fine. Real fine.

Yeah, it's not a problem.

19:44.861 --> 19:47.761
So, uh, let's talk
about your song.

19:47.763 --> 19:50.997
Yeah, I was actually surprised
you put a hold on it.

19:50.999 --> 19:53.666
I wasn't sure you were
too comfortable with me.

19:53.668 --> 19:55.000
What do you mean?

19:55.002 --> 19:58.370

The way you made sure
that photographer

20:00.207 --> 20:02.207

the two of us together?

20:02.209 --> 20:04.842
I'm not gonna lie.

You've chosen a lifestyle

have trouble with.

my wife does, too.

20:10.749 --> 20:13.382
She's got this big charity
of hers,

20:13.384 --> 20:15.617
And most of her donors wouldn't
like seeing me with someone...

20:17.621 --> 20:19.420
It'd be an endorsement --

20:19.422 --> 20:21.622
That's how they'd see it
anyway --

20:21.624 --> 20:23.624
Of something
they don't approve of.

20:23.626 --> 20:24.958
Guess I can see that.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.727
Personally, I don't have
a problem with it,

20:27.729 --> 20:31.229

the whole chorus,

a small part and -- and...

to be like you.

with me, okay?

What?
Well, that's what
you said --

That mom only signed us
so you wouldn't do it alone,

a little kid.

35:05.472 --> 35:07.605
Nope. No, no.
No misunderstanding.

35:07.607 --> 35:09.740
Okay.
All right, well, good.

35:09.742 --> 35:10.974
So I'll see you tomorrow
at the studio.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.375
Yes, you will.
Okay.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.542
Good work today.
You too.

35:13.544 --> 35:15.644
Bye.
Bye.

35:20.984 --> 35:21.849
[ sighs ]

35:24.119 --> 35:27.220
Wade cole is worse than
a bigot -- he's a hypocrite.

35:27.222 --> 35:29.722
His wife runs one of those,
um...

35:29.724 --> 35:31.957
"traditional value"-type
organizations

35:31.959 --> 35:34.659
That wants to round up anyone
they disapprove of,

35:34.661 --> 35:36.827
Stick us on
an island somewhere.

35:36.829 --> 35:39.596
I mean, my publisher says
I'm a fool if I say "no,"

35:39.598 --> 35:41.764
But I can't work
with the guy.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.766
Then why are you even wasting
time talking about it?

35:43.768 --> 35:46.101
Why you got
to be a jackass?

35:46.103 --> 35:48.770
Look, I just had to bail
on my gig at the 5 spot

35:48.772 --> 35:51.572
To take yet another crappy job
just to make ends meet,

35:51.574 --> 35:53.941
So forgive me if I'm
not being sensitive enough

35:53.943 --> 35:55.275
To your
high-class problem.

35:55.277 --> 35:57.076
I'm sorry, man.
When were you gonna tell me?

35:57.078 --> 35:59.511
Well, you've been so busy
flip-flopping about wade cole,

35:59.513 --> 36:01.179
I haven't had a chance.

36:01.181 --> 36:03.314
I'm not flip-flopping.
This is a tough decision here.

36:03.316 --> 36:05.082
Will, you don't like
the guy?
No.

36:05.084 --> 36:07.317
Don't like what he stands for?
Then don't do it.

36:07.319 --> 36:10.420
[ scoffs ]

36:10.422 --> 36:12.855
It's one damn song,
and it could make your career.

[ cadence crying ]

36:14.658 --> 36:16.724

36:21.830 --> 36:24.730
What we want to do
and what we need to do...

36:26.467 --> 36:29.167
...They don't always
line up.

36:36.809 --> 36:39.276
You know, it just came to me
like, uh, like magic really.

36:39.278 --> 36:42.178
Cool.
I can't wait to hear it.

36:42.180 --> 36:44.847
[ clears throat ]
just in case I get weepy.

36:44.849 --> 36:46.582

you're gonna need those.

Yeah. Yeah. A productive
day off. [ chuckles ]

37:57.773 --> 38:00.340
How about you?
H-how was your trip?

38:00.342 --> 38:02.108
Oh, it was real good.
Thanks.

38:02.110 --> 38:04.577
Well,
I'll leave you guys alone.

38:04.579 --> 38:06.445
Have fun.
It sounds really good.

38:06.447 --> 38:08.246
[ laughs ]
all right.

38:08.248 --> 38:09.680
That was so good!

I really enjoyed our session

I love you.

I've loved you
my whole life,

39:43.854 --> 39:46.487
And I'm gonna keep doing that
till I die.

39:46.489 --> 39:50.356
There's nobody that's
gonna come between us.

I'm sorry
I got all heated.

you know?

being all mine yet.

Mm.

40:02.432 --> 40:04.999
I talked to markus,

40:05.001 --> 40:08.268
And I made it very clear to him
"deacon is my guy."

40:08.270 --> 40:11.703
And he better back off.

I was crazy.

You do keep choosing me.

40:35.123 --> 40:37.289
He can change any damn lyric
he wants, all right?

He can have
the whole damn song.

to settle things.

going on between us --

or a camping trip

down here --

I'm gonna stay with him
for a while.

or his.

I'm not even sure your mom

41:27.362 --> 41:29.095
Would want you staying
with her dad anyways.

except for you.

than I am --

Bounce-a-quarter
off-a-sheet strict.

41:42.841 --> 41:46.209
Well, at least he stands
for something,

41:46.211 --> 41:48.678
Which is more than I can say
for you, dad.
