WEBVTT

00:35.032 --> 00:36.782
Driver's license and
registration, please, sir.

00:36.806 --> 00:39.227
Sorry, Officer. My wife...

00:39.815 --> 00:41.418
pregnant. Hm...

00:41.442 --> 00:44.077
She's always calling
me when I'm driving.

00:44.101 --> 00:45.945
And registration, sir.

00:48.341 --> 00:49.409
Gun!

00:49.433 --> 00:50.788
Sir, put your hands up on the dashboard!

00:50.812 --> 00:51.940
But... my wife.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.629
Hands on the dashboard!
I want to see your hands!

00:54.762 --> 00:56.396
All right, nice and
slow, I want your hands

00:56.420 --> 00:58.726
through the window opening
the door from the outside

00:58.750 --> 01:00.209
and step out of the car.

01:00.233 --> 01:01.346
Now!

01:03.855 --> 01:05.541
- Charlie.
- I got it.

01:06.489 --> 01:07.767
On the hood, sir, now.

01:07.791 --> 01:09.037
Hands behind your back.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.480
You just fired this gun, sir?

01:22.477 --> 01:23.569
Damn.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.980
You okay, sir?

01:26.351 --> 01:27.380
Sir?

02:28.406 --> 02:29.969
Men are such bad liars.

02:29.993 --> 02:31.901
But if a good liar
was telling you a lie,

02:31.925 --> 02:33.307
you would not know it was a lie.

02:33.331 --> 02:34.947
Ha! I would.

02:34.971 --> 02:36.256
How would you know?

02:36.280 --> 02:37.028
Know what?

02:37.052 --> 02:39.659
When an expert liar
is telling Ziva a lie.

02:39.683 --> 02:40.848
And this started how?

02:40.872 --> 02:43.395
Well, I told her that I
went to the gym this morning.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.521
No great skill in guessing
you were fibbing there, probie.

02:46.545 --> 02:47.956
You may have lost some
weight, and personally,

02:47.980 --> 02:48.757
I'm very proud of you,

02:48.781 --> 02:50.773
but "gym" is definitely
not your middle name.

02:50.797 --> 02:52.911
Okay, well, Ziva...

02:52.935 --> 02:55.223
thinks that all men are liars.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.428
Really?

02:58.493 --> 02:59.819
So if...

02:59.843 --> 03:03.470
I were to lie to you,
you would be able to tell?

03:05.302 --> 03:06.950
Particularly you.

03:06.974 --> 03:08.054
You think?

03:08.305 --> 03:09.107
Wouldn't go there, Tony.

03:09.131 --> 03:11.315
Oh, watch and weep.

03:11.339 --> 03:12.942
True or false:

03:12.966 --> 03:15.527
I had eggs for breakfast this morning.

03:15.685 --> 03:16.797
True.

03:16.902 --> 03:18.487
Lucky guess.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.150
Last night,

03:20.174 --> 03:23.484
I had a date with a
very beautiful woman.

03:23.588 --> 03:24.194
False.

03:24.218 --> 03:25.126
She's good.

03:25.150 --> 03:28.450
My first car was a
shiny new red Corvette.

03:28.474 --> 03:29.570
False.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.117
Strike three.

03:31.141 --> 03:32.386
I win.

03:32.659 --> 03:33.951
How did you do that?

03:33.975 --> 03:36.571
When you said you had a red Corvette,
you looked down and to the left

03:36.595 --> 03:39.069
a telltale sign when people lie.

03:39.093 --> 03:39.755
And the date?

03:39.779 --> 03:40.060
Gibbs.

03:40.084 --> 03:41.162
Tony...

03:41.823 --> 03:43.573
if you'd gone out with a
beautiful woman last night,

03:43.597 --> 03:45.115
you'd have talked about it all day.

03:45.139 --> 03:46.921
- I would?
- Oh, yeah.

03:46.945 --> 03:49.265
Okay, but how could you possibly know

03:49.289 --> 03:51.062
that I had eggs for
breakfast this morning?

03:51.086 --> 03:51.777
Gear up.

03:51.801 --> 03:53.320
Got a message from a dead guy.

03:53.344 --> 03:54.405
Ready to roll, boss.

03:54.429 --> 03:55.329
Dinozzo...

03:55.353 --> 03:56.406
Yeah, boss?

03:56.430 --> 03:58.197
You got egg on your shirt.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.123
Not just your shirt.

04:04.094 --> 04:07.465
It's amazing what the
human body can endure.

04:07.489 --> 04:10.513
This poor fellow probably
lasted longer than he should.

04:10.537 --> 04:11.893
How much longer?

04:11.917 --> 04:13.031
Several minutes.

04:13.055 --> 04:15.325
Not much when you stack it against

04:15.349 --> 04:18.660
a lifetime of minutes,
but minutes nonetheless.

04:18.684 --> 04:20.910
He could've driven a couple of miles.

04:20.934 --> 04:22.728
More like a couple city blocks.

04:22.752 --> 04:24.361
Traffic sucks this time of day.

04:24.385 --> 04:25.986
According to his military ID,

04:26.010 --> 04:28.595
he's Chief Petty Officer Jack T. Vale.

04:28.619 --> 04:29.684
You know him?

04:29.708 --> 04:30.267
No.

04:30.291 --> 04:31.905
Well, he knows you guys.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.472
Jackpot.

04:38.496 --> 04:40.348
Got to be 50 or 60 bucks there.

04:40.372 --> 04:42.837
Yeah, there's more
in his trouser pocket.

04:42.861 --> 04:44.837
What do you think, illegal slots?

04:45.288 --> 04:47.492
Maybe he was on his
way to a video arcade.

04:47.516 --> 04:48.923
Maybe he was doing laundry.

04:48.947 --> 04:50.362
That's a lot of laundry.

04:50.386 --> 04:53.081
Maybe he was a once-
a-month kind of man.

04:53.105 --> 04:54.700
I do it once a week.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.376
Laundry.

04:56.982 --> 04:58.394
Who's the fare?

04:59.008 --> 05:01.209
Oh, that's Robert John Stevens.

05:01.233 --> 05:04.883
But the guy's got an accent as thick
as Polish sausage, so I ain't buying it.

05:04.907 --> 05:08.263
Found a loaded.38 on
the seat, recently fired.

05:08.353 --> 05:09.893
Got an exit wound?

05:10.036 --> 05:12.346
Well, there doesn't
appear to be an exit wound.

05:12.370 --> 05:15.026
So I dig out the bullet,
you match it to the weapon

05:15.050 --> 05:17.914
and, hey, presto, justice prevails.

05:17.938 --> 05:19.664
Open and shut case, boss.

05:19.688 --> 05:22.371
No such thing, DiNozzo, only watertight.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.564
Give me a call when you're finished.

05:24.588 --> 05:26.233
You got it, Ducky.

05:30.323 --> 05:32.229
Doesn't look like a fake ID.

05:32.384 --> 05:33.041
Fake.

05:33.065 --> 05:34.177
What are you talking about?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.697
You barely got a look at it.

05:35.721 --> 05:38.283
I can spot a fake a mile away.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.981
I had the best fake ID in college.

05:42.005 --> 05:43.992
Never got turned away from a bar.

05:44.839 --> 05:45.994
Never?

05:46.492 --> 05:47.877
Never.

05:48.942 --> 05:50.015
Once.

05:50.039 --> 05:51.298
Once?

05:51.415 --> 05:53.527
- Or twice.
- A month?

05:54.075 --> 05:57.030
A week. But, listen, we went out
every night, and it was a college town.

05:57.054 --> 05:59.055
And they're very tough
there, eagle-eyed bouncers.

05:59.079 --> 06:00.581
You really had to act
the part, too, you know?

06:00.605 --> 06:02.812
You had to be mature,
worldly, kind of grown up.

06:02.836 --> 06:04.731
So it wasn't really the ID, it was you.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.404
Are you kidding me?

06:06.832 --> 06:08.201
No, I was...

06:08.480 --> 06:10.491
I was the master of fake.

06:14.861 --> 06:17.148
Last call dialed was 911.

06:17.187 --> 06:18.975
Cops will have it on tape.

06:19.111 --> 06:20.885
Maybe this one will be easy.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.639
Fake name...

06:35.035 --> 06:36.560
fake plates.

06:36.801 --> 06:38.262
Real weapon.

06:38.286 --> 06:39.729
Real guy dead.

06:42.972 --> 06:45.655
When he first saw you, he called 911.

06:48.789 --> 06:52.106
When you realized he was
trailing you, you shot him.

06:56.846 --> 07:01.280
Even the very, very good ones

07:01.894 --> 07:03.893
slip up eventually.

07:04.453 --> 07:06.070
And you...

07:07.520 --> 07:10.161
Mister... Stevens?

07:11.063 --> 07:12.860
You're not very good.

07:15.827 --> 07:18.288
- Women want men to lie to them.
- Not true.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.904
"Honey, does my butt look
big in these pants to you?"

07:21.928 --> 07:23.763
"Actually, yes, sweetheart,

07:23.787 --> 07:25.723
"your butt looks as big as Alabama.

07:25.747 --> 07:28.445
"Didn't want to say anything, but
you got the 'Bama butt going on."

07:28.469 --> 07:29.557
See?

07:29.581 --> 07:31.496
You want us to lie to you, so we do.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.839
Especially if your
butt is as big as 'Bama.

07:35.526 --> 07:36.498
Not that...

07:36.522 --> 07:39.042
not that your butt is big.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.289
- And not that I've even looked.
- Liar.

07:41.313 --> 07:42.386
Okay,

07:42.650 --> 07:45.093
I have looked, but, you know, I never...

07:45.117 --> 07:46.112
Never what?

07:46.136 --> 07:47.372
Oh, no.

07:48.597 --> 07:50.817
I... I'm catching on to you.

07:50.841 --> 07:52.354
And you're not going to
get me to say something

07:52.378 --> 07:55.153
and then do your little
Mossad true-or-false trick.

07:55.177 --> 07:56.763
I'm too smart for that.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.210
Of course you are.

08:02.204 --> 08:03.954
- Ziva...
- Gibbs.

08:05.595 --> 08:07.386
How many languages do you speak?

08:13.792 --> 08:15.480
Comment vous-appelez-vous?

08:17.071 --> 08:18.774
Ah, French.

08:19.007 --> 08:21.246
Was wir nur wissen
wollen ist ihre naame.

08:21.270 --> 08:22.845
Und German.

08:24.619 --> 08:26.450
Mi dica il suo nome.

08:26.928 --> 08:29.281
Italian. Of course.

08:30.790 --> 08:33.119
Lee ma betellna essmak?

08:35.359 --> 08:36.438
Greek?

08:36.462 --> 08:37.688
Arabic.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.628
Nice, boss.

08:40.126 --> 08:41.899
Skah-zhee-teh,
kahk vahs zah-voot?

08:44.193 --> 08:46.815
Ah. Got him. He's Russian.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.244
Looked down and to the
left. Sure sign of a liar.

08:49.268 --> 08:51.286
That's very good, DiNozzo.

08:51.310 --> 08:52.056
Thanks, boss.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.612
Ziva tell you that?

08:59.876 --> 09:04.165
Tell me you found a match
on our suspect's prints, Ab.

09:04.189 --> 09:04.865
Negative.

09:04.889 --> 09:06.404
Still processing.

09:06.428 --> 09:10.347
What we do have is $73.65.

09:10.371 --> 09:11.973
That's what the victim was carrying.

09:11.997 --> 09:13.909
And there's no pennies.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.264
He probably threw them out.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.609
A lot people do, you know.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.266
I mean, I don't, but other people do.

09:18.290 --> 09:22.232
Do you know how many pennies are
thrown out or put into jars every year?

09:22.256 --> 09:23.146
Enlighten me.

09:23.170 --> 09:25.362
Three and a half
billion. Billion, Gibbs.

09:25.386 --> 09:27.933
That's, like, $35 million in pennies.

09:27.957 --> 09:29.993
That's a lot of pennies in any language.

09:30.017 --> 09:31.440
Including Russian.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.138
No, Russians don't have
pennies, they have kopecks.

09:34.162 --> 09:35.060
What's it have to do with Russia?

09:35.084 --> 09:37.538
Run his prints through
Immigration and let's find out.

09:37.562 --> 09:39.482
Oh, because he's a foreigner

09:39.506 --> 09:42.002
and every visitor is printed
when they enter the U.S.

09:42.026 --> 09:43.601
Clever, Gibbs.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.781
Okay, I reviewed the 911 call.

09:46.805 --> 09:47.808
Ready?

09:49.333 --> 09:50.996
My name is Jack Vale.

09:51.020 --> 09:52.832
This is really important, okay?

09:52.856 --> 09:55.243
I've identified a
terrorist, a known terrorist.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.506
I'm following him downtown right now.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.753
Get someone over here. Call NC...

09:59.777 --> 10:01.333
NCIS.

10:01.496 --> 10:04.770
I'm guessing an overtaxed
relay tower in the downtown area

10:04.794 --> 10:07.181
caused the line to drop
off before he finished.

10:07.205 --> 10:10.093
But, Gibbs, this guy works
in the supply department.

10:10.117 --> 10:11.754
What would he know about terrorists?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.099
That's a good question.

10:13.123 --> 10:15.620
I also isolated the background noise.

10:22.293 --> 10:25.897
It's kind of a Pac-Man-
retro-meets-Vegas sort of thing.

10:25.921 --> 10:27.647
Not really something you hear in a car.

10:27.671 --> 10:29.739
He was on foot when he made the call.

10:30.447 --> 10:31.761
We have a winner.

10:31.933 --> 10:35.113
Nikolai Aleksandrovich Puchenko.

10:35.137 --> 10:36.346
Russian.

10:39.457 --> 10:41.728
And there's a Homeland Security alert.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.332
You're not the only one
interested in Mr. Nikolai Puchenko.

11:05.546 --> 11:07.253
I want lawyer.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.980
Get a good one.

11:09.431 --> 11:12.153
Tell him the charge
is going to be murder.

11:14.202 --> 11:17.059
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.382
Normally matching the
bullet to the weapon

11:19.406 --> 11:24.476
shouldn't present us with any great
difficulty, but this is far from normal.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.576
How far?

11:25.600 --> 11:30.172
I haven't seen anything like it
in 25 years of slicing and dicing.

11:30.196 --> 11:33.206
The bullet entered below the rib cage,

11:33.230 --> 11:34.882
traveling from left to right.

11:34.906 --> 11:36.026
It nicked the pancreas,

11:36.050 --> 11:38.249
missed the liver,
deflected off the fifth rib

11:38.273 --> 11:40.473
and gouged its way through soft tissue

11:40.497 --> 11:42.943
and perforated the stomach.

11:43.107 --> 11:44.560
No exit wound.

11:44.584 --> 11:49.827
And so that's where it
appears to have, um...

11:50.884 --> 11:53.171
To have um, what, Dr. Mallard?

11:53.575 --> 11:55.068
Vanished.

11:55.092 --> 11:57.498
It's not in the bullet furrow

11:57.522 --> 12:00.364
and it's not showing
up on any of the X-rays.

12:00.388 --> 12:02.539
I don't know where it's gone.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.740
I'm afraid we don't have a bullet.

12:17.384 --> 12:20.133
The 911 call was routed
through this tower here.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.006
Anyone ever heard of Operation Sunburst?

12:22.030 --> 12:26.401
That locates Vale somewhere in
this area when he made the call.

12:26.425 --> 12:28.080
Anywhere outside of the
circle would have meant that

12:28.104 --> 12:29.595
the call was routed through
a different cell tower.

12:29.619 --> 12:30.633
Back in '91.

12:30.657 --> 12:32.654
Come one, anyone, Operation Sunburst.

12:32.678 --> 12:35.202
About three city blocks...

12:35.226 --> 12:36.227
Less.

12:36.251 --> 12:38.276
Abby said the signal dropped
out. That probably puts him

12:38.300 --> 12:41.077
at the outside edge of the
reception area of that tower.

12:41.101 --> 12:43.660
That's pretty clever, boss.
How'd you figure that out?

12:43.954 --> 12:45.064
Too much time around you.

12:45.088 --> 12:45.986
Boss...

12:46.010 --> 12:48.014
Operation Sunburst, you know it?

12:48.038 --> 12:49.024
It was a sting.

12:49.048 --> 12:51.124
One of our ops. Chief
Vale was part of it.

12:51.148 --> 12:52.487
He was just a P.O. Three back then

12:52.511 --> 12:54.034
detailed from the Supply Department

12:54.058 --> 12:55.957
to NIS for five weeks.

12:55.981 --> 12:57.584
Get that file from archives.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.029
I can't.

12:59.614 --> 13:02.669
I mean, it's not possible,
boss. I got the index reference,

13:02.693 --> 13:05.329
but when I called the archive,
they said the file was missing.

13:05.353 --> 13:07.700
Check the log. Who booked it out last?

13:08.306 --> 13:09.553
CIA.

13:09.577 --> 13:11.856
So I guess that's not a
"who," it's more of an "it."

13:11.880 --> 13:13.515
Who was the NIS case agent?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.075
What time is it in Mexico right now?

13:20.646 --> 13:22.516
Cantina time.

13:32.705 --> 13:33.725
Si.

13:34.821 --> 13:36.017
Si.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.891
Washington, senor.

13:45.456 --> 13:48.510
Only one person in Washington DC

13:48.534 --> 13:51.063
knows where to find me this time of day.

13:51.087 --> 13:52.370
How you doing, probie?

13:52.394 --> 13:54.126
Well, I'm surviving.

13:54.228 --> 13:55.230
You?

13:55.254 --> 13:56.300
Sun's hot,

13:56.324 --> 13:57.462
ocean's warm,

13:57.486 --> 13:58.736
beer's cold.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.107
Got no complaints.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.502
You change your mind?

14:01.526 --> 14:02.747
Every day.

14:03.309 --> 14:04.567
But then something stops me.

14:04.591 --> 14:06.475
What's stopping you this time?

14:06.499 --> 14:08.779
Operation Sunburst.

14:09.276 --> 14:11.190
That was a long time ago.

14:11.214 --> 14:13.686
Do you remember a petty
officer named Vale?

14:14.212 --> 14:16.855
Right guy, right place, right time.

14:16.879 --> 14:18.489
Went undercover for us.

14:18.513 --> 14:20.696
Well, he was shot dead this morning.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.396
And you think this has
something to do with Sunburst?

14:24.420 --> 14:26.145
Well, you tell me.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.379
We got a suspect.

14:27.403 --> 14:28.564
Russian.

14:29.972 --> 14:31.279
Arkady Kobach?

14:31.303 --> 14:32.529
Nikolai...

14:32.553 --> 14:33.090
Puchenko.

14:33.114 --> 14:36.260
Arkady Kobach is the man
you need to worry about.

14:36.284 --> 14:38.175
Puchenko and he served together.

14:38.199 --> 14:40.793
When the Soviet Union
started started falling apart,

14:40.817 --> 14:42.139
they got into the arms trade.

14:42.163 --> 14:45.746
Wanted to buy some of our Stingers
to sell to Chechen terrorists.

14:45.770 --> 14:47.950
Tried to bribe Vale in
the Supply Department.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.277
So you sent him undercover?

14:49.301 --> 14:50.731
Someone tipped them off.

14:50.755 --> 14:52.679
They hightailed it
back to Easter Europe.

14:52.703 --> 14:53.261
A month later,

14:53.285 --> 14:57.981
the CIA stuck its nose in and our
file conveniently went missing.

15:00.146 --> 15:01.501
What happened to Vale?

15:01.525 --> 15:03.525
He bumped into Puchenko in the street.

15:03.549 --> 15:05.748
Recognized him, tried to follow him.

15:05.961 --> 15:07.447
Puchenko shot him.

15:09.901 --> 15:12.346
I hope you've got an ironclad case.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.183
This piece of scum is way overdue.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.308
Yeah.

15:17.367 --> 15:18.986
Working on it, boss.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.953
Good luck with the fishing down there.

15:21.159 --> 15:22.532
Thanks for the tip.

15:22.954 --> 15:24.119
Good luck.

15:29.177 --> 15:31.040
We got a case yet, DiNozzo?

15:31.133 --> 15:32.796
Like you said, working on it, boss.

15:32.820 --> 15:34.592
We've narrowed down the
area where he was shot,

15:34.616 --> 15:37.213
and we do have a suspect
in possession of a gun.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.503
Which means murder one.

15:38.527 --> 15:39.449
With a bullet.

15:39.473 --> 15:41.171
If we can find one.

15:50.863 --> 15:52.092
Hi, Ducky.

15:55.002 --> 15:56.349
Penny for your thoughts.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.097
Or three and a half billion pennies.

16:00.577 --> 16:02.644
That was an in-joke.

16:03.146 --> 16:05.518
So I have a pristine

16:05.542 --> 16:08.216
bullet sample fired
from our suspect's.38.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.796
All I need is the bullet
you pulled from him.

16:10.820 --> 16:11.710
I'll make a match

16:11.734 --> 16:14.596
and we'll send the bad guys wherever
the bad guys go when we catch 'em.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.515
Where do the bad guys
go when we catch 'em?

16:16.539 --> 16:19.211
The bullet's disappeared, Abby.

16:19.738 --> 16:21.180
I thought there was no exit wound?

16:21.204 --> 16:23.120
There is no exit wound.

16:23.144 --> 16:25.332
Well, maybe it fell out, like
in his clothes or something.

16:25.356 --> 16:26.490
I already checked.

16:26.514 --> 16:27.839
Or an evidence bag.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.242
- Checked.
- Or a body bag.

16:29.266 --> 16:30.647
Ditto.

16:31.214 --> 16:33.878
Well, bullets don't
just disappear, Ducky.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.678
Unless it's an ice bullet.

16:35.702 --> 16:38.765
I saw this really cool movie one
time where this guy carved a bullet...

16:38.789 --> 16:41.409
- It's not an ice bullet.
- .. Out of ice...

16:43.888 --> 16:46.031
Do you really think you lost a bullet?

16:46.534 --> 16:48.232
I didn't lose it.

16:49.515 --> 16:51.377
At least, I don't think I did.

16:52.461 --> 16:54.483
Oh, Ducky.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.371
I'd be sick to my
stomach if I lost evidence

16:57.395 --> 17:00.993
or screwed something up like
a DNA sample or a fingerprint.

17:01.017 --> 17:02.388
Of course!

17:02.412 --> 17:04.242
That's got to be it.

17:04.267 --> 17:07.724
Nothing else makes any
sense. Abby, you are a genius.

17:13.809 --> 17:15.006
Probie.

17:15.455 --> 17:16.702
Yeah.

17:18.442 --> 17:19.652
What's this?

17:19.675 --> 17:20.926
Number three?

17:20.951 --> 17:21.951
Four.

17:22.217 --> 17:24.954
Would have thought you'd have
been done practicing by now.

17:24.979 --> 17:26.964
There's always something to learn, Mike.

17:27.636 --> 17:29.222
Hard lessons.

17:29.246 --> 17:30.938
Some harder than others.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.112
Got any extra fine?

17:37.113 --> 17:39.184
You didn't waste any time getting here.

17:40.705 --> 17:41.927
You were expecting me?

17:41.951 --> 17:44.392
Well, I would have been
disappointed if you didn't come.

17:44.416 --> 17:47.201
Yeah, well, let's just say I...

17:47.225 --> 17:49.029
don't like loose ends, probie.

17:49.053 --> 17:52.839
Take more than loose ends to
get you off that beach in Baja.

17:53.801 --> 17:58.643
These scumbags have been selling
weapons to tyrants and terrorists

17:58.667 --> 18:00.990
ever since they gave us the slip.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.115
Guns...

18:03.139 --> 18:03.973
and bombs...

18:03.997 --> 18:07.657
and RPGs used to kill
American soldiers and marines

18:07.681 --> 18:11.098
in every hellhole from
Mogadishu to Baghdad.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.198
It's time it ended.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.069
You know who tipped them?

18:16.093 --> 18:18.189
Rumor was they'd agreed to supply

18:18.213 --> 18:21.749
some new high-tech
Soviet missile to CIA.

18:21.773 --> 18:26.328
Guess they figured they wouldn't get their
missile if their arms dealers were in prison.

18:26.674 --> 18:29.730
Which is exactly where
I was going to send them.

18:32.497 --> 18:34.768
You've got a chance here, probie.

18:35.038 --> 18:36.555
Don't screw it up.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.781
Same to you, Nikolai.

18:43.922 --> 18:44.925
Who's that with him?

18:44.949 --> 18:46.440
Marty Allen. His lawyer.

18:46.464 --> 18:48.462
Hope he's not a good lawyer.

18:49.309 --> 18:50.616
Enjoy your tour?

18:50.640 --> 18:51.626
Yeah,

18:51.650 --> 18:53.961
place is like a video arcade.

18:54.247 --> 18:56.944
You've got more technology in one room

18:56.968 --> 19:00.338
than we had in every office
across the whole damn country.

19:00.362 --> 19:01.196
You know...

19:01.220 --> 19:04.394
if I needed to interrogate someone
when I worked at Camp Pendleton,

19:04.418 --> 19:06.439
I'd take them into the broom closet

19:06.463 --> 19:07.841
with a telephone directory.

19:07.865 --> 19:10.842
No broom closet, no
telephone directory...

19:11.376 --> 19:12.885
No smoking.

19:13.035 --> 19:15.847
Another three reasons
why I left just in...

19:16.205 --> 19:17.362
time.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.140
Special Agent Gibbs,

19:20.164 --> 19:21.786
may I have a moment?

19:21.911 --> 19:23.606
Ooh-rah, Gunny.

19:24.352 --> 19:25.378
You know that guy?

19:25.402 --> 19:26.583
Yeah...

19:26.933 --> 19:29.292
Like a rat knows a snake.

19:30.877 --> 19:31.911
Director Shepard...

19:31.935 --> 19:33.522
Special Agent Gibbs,

19:33.546 --> 19:35.978
this is Roy Carver, Homeland Security.

19:36.002 --> 19:37.321
Agent Gibbs.

19:37.345 --> 19:40.832
Mr. Carver is here in relation
to a suspect we're holding.

19:40.856 --> 19:42.198
Nikolai Puchenko.

19:42.222 --> 19:45.711
I'd like you to transfer him
into Mr. Carver's custody.

19:47.191 --> 19:47.777
Why?

19:47.801 --> 19:49.508
He's working for us.

19:49.532 --> 19:54.898
He's providing valuable intel on the arms
trade among terrorist groups in Eastern Europe.

19:55.624 --> 19:58.573
Was he working for you when
he killed a sailor yesterday?

19:58.883 --> 20:02.538
I read the preliminary autopsy
report on that, Agent Gibbs.

20:02.562 --> 20:05.639
Seems there's a lack of evidence
linking Puchenko to the crime.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.555
He was carrying an illegal firearm.

20:07.579 --> 20:09.242
Not connected to the shooting.

20:09.266 --> 20:10.127
Yet.

20:10.151 --> 20:10.881
Well..

20:10.905 --> 20:15.550
Well, find evidence that he was involved in
any serious criminal activity and I promise...

20:15.574 --> 20:17.399
I'll hand him right back to you.

20:17.574 --> 20:20.470
Do we have anything yet, Agent Gibbs?

20:21.221 --> 20:22.264
We will.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.767
Until we do,

20:23.791 --> 20:26.206
I'm releasing him to Homeland Security.

20:37.889 --> 20:39.607
Ziva, get Puchenko.

20:43.860 --> 20:45.451
Hello, this is Special Agent DiNozzo.

20:45.475 --> 20:48.263
I have Ziva David coming down
to pick up Nikolai Puchenko.

20:53.258 --> 20:57.285
If he walks out of here,
you won't see him again.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.659
Any evidence you have
won't be worth spit.

21:00.780 --> 21:03.651
We haven't got enough evidence
to even clear our throat.

21:03.675 --> 21:05.653
We can't charge him with anything.

21:05.677 --> 21:09.896
Mr. Carver, if you'll just sign
these custody transfer forms.

21:12.979 --> 21:14.116
Director...

21:15.645 --> 21:20.185
may I draw your attention to
an NIS case code name Sunburst.

21:20.209 --> 21:25.207
Which dealt with serious allegations of
arms smuggling by this man Nikolai Puchenko.

21:25.231 --> 21:26.906
I'm aware of the case, Mr. Franks.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.111
As I recall, the file was lost, Mike.

21:30.252 --> 21:32.347
I made a copy, Roy.

21:33.330 --> 21:35.286
Jack Vale was the key witness.

21:35.310 --> 21:36.579
He's dead.

21:36.793 --> 21:38.783
You don't have anyone to testify.

21:39.494 --> 21:41.101
I was the case agent.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.846
I'll testify.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.925
Serious enough charges
for you, Director Shepard?

21:48.705 --> 21:50.131
Take him back into custody.

21:50.155 --> 21:51.566
I'm sorry, Mr. Carver.

21:51.590 --> 21:54.214
NCIS is not through with this man.

21:54.251 --> 21:56.579
Homeland Security looks
forward to reviewing the file.

21:56.603 --> 21:58.030
This is an outrage.

21:58.054 --> 22:01.948
I strongly protest your
department's treatment of my client.

22:07.589 --> 22:08.770
Come on.

22:10.026 --> 22:12.040
What did he just say?

22:13.232 --> 22:15.166
He said you're a dead man,

22:15.709 --> 22:16.749
Mike.

22:24.220 --> 22:26.657
We're taking Puchenko's threat
to kill Franks seriously,

22:26.681 --> 22:28.832
so right now this is who
we have to worry about.

22:28.856 --> 22:29.869
McGee?

22:30.075 --> 22:32.287
Arkady Mikhailovich Kobach,

22:32.311 --> 22:33.350
late 40s.

22:33.374 --> 22:37.391
Served with Puchenko in the Spetsnaz
That's the Soviet Special Forces.

22:37.415 --> 22:39.547
First Afghanistan then Chechnya.

22:39.571 --> 22:43.017
In 1990, Arkady executed three
clerks in a payroll office

22:43.041 --> 22:44.874
because they could not pay his men.

22:44.898 --> 22:47.400
Then shot the colonel
who came to arrest him.

22:47.424 --> 22:49.427
Been dealing arms ever since.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.758
I want a 24-hour protection
detail. DiNozzo, you're team leader.

22:52.782 --> 22:54.297
You're in safe hands, Mike.

22:54.321 --> 22:57.299
I've seen your hands,
DiNozzo. They don't impress me.

22:57.323 --> 23:00.585
I don't need babysitting,
Gunny. I can look after myself.

23:00.609 --> 23:04.052
After spending four months in that
crap hole you call a home in Baja,

23:04.076 --> 23:06.217
I find that highly debatable.

23:06.241 --> 23:07.982
- Safe house, boss?
- Yep. Mine.

23:08.789 --> 23:10.087
Make yourself at home, Tony.

23:10.111 --> 23:11.290
Won't touch a thing, boss.

23:11.314 --> 23:12.346
McGee.

23:12.961 --> 23:14.262
We'll be right down.

23:14.504 --> 23:16.350
Boss, Ducky found the bullet.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.934
It's fascinating where
bullets can end up.

23:19.958 --> 23:22.857
I once found a.22 caliber
slug in a woman's knee

23:22.881 --> 23:24.699
and she'd been shot in the chest.

23:24.723 --> 23:26.479
See, the bullet entered her heart,

23:26.503 --> 23:28.538
was pumped down through the aorta

23:28.562 --> 23:32.017
into the iliac and on down
into the femoral artery.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.150
Extraordinary.

23:33.174 --> 23:34.586
So the missing bullet's in his knee?

23:34.610 --> 23:35.653
No, no. Good heavens, no.

23:35.677 --> 23:37.848
That's much to easy, and
anyway, it would have...

23:37.872 --> 23:39.218
shown up on the X-rays.

23:39.242 --> 23:40.597
So where is it?

23:40.621 --> 23:41.607
I have no idea.

23:41.631 --> 23:43.070
None at all.

23:43.094 --> 23:44.300
You said you found it.

23:44.324 --> 23:46.932
Well, I have. I just don't know where.

23:46.956 --> 23:49.866
I can, however, tell you how.

23:49.890 --> 23:52.062
It was Abby who gave me the idea

23:52.086 --> 23:56.450
when she said that she would be sick to
her stomach if she ever lost evidence.

23:56.474 --> 23:58.547
"Sick," that's the key word.

23:58.571 --> 24:01.420
So I had Abby run some tests of material

24:01.444 --> 24:05.684
I took from his esophagus and we
found traces of protease pepsin

24:05.708 --> 24:09.459
along with all sorts of
other things such as sulfides,

24:09.483 --> 24:11.635
oleic acid, polyphenols.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.325
But...

24:12.349 --> 24:14.705
the smoking gun, so to speak,

24:14.729 --> 24:17.551
was the presence of triticum durum.

24:17.575 --> 24:18.292
Pasta?

24:18.316 --> 24:22.220
Specifically spaghetti cooked
with garlic and olive oil.

24:22.244 --> 24:25.297
Spaghetti aglio y
olio, as the Romans say.

24:25.321 --> 24:27.574
Very nice with a glass of Sangiovese.

24:27.598 --> 24:31.116
Anyway, anyway, when the bullet
became lodged in his stomach,

24:31.140 --> 24:34.403
he became sick. What you might call...

24:34.427 --> 24:35.909
projectile vomit.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.072
He puked up the bullet?

24:37.096 --> 24:39.384
Yeah. Find the puke and
you'll find the projectile.

24:39.408 --> 24:42.482
So you want us to look for
a pile of dried-up vomit.

24:42.506 --> 24:44.482
Yes, and I'll need a generous sample

24:44.506 --> 24:47.957
so I can positively match it
to what I found in the victim.

24:47.981 --> 24:49.710
Oh, and of course...

24:49.964 --> 24:51.217
the bullet.

24:52.072 --> 24:54.008
Ziva, McGee, get onto it.

24:54.032 --> 24:57.402
Well, uh, boss, we have narrowed
it down to a few city blocks.

24:57.426 --> 24:59.466
Vale must have still been
on foot when he was shot

24:59.490 --> 25:01.218
or he would have gotten sick in the car.

25:01.242 --> 25:04.200
So maybe a parking garage or a
parking lot. That narrows it down.

25:04.224 --> 25:07.223
Go, go. Don't come
back without the bullet.

25:12.226 --> 25:13.752
Where is Mike?

25:16.841 --> 25:19.043
I thought you were supposed
to be protecting him.

25:19.067 --> 25:20.713
I was. I mean, I...

25:21.796 --> 25:23.426
He was right here.

25:24.329 --> 25:25.383
Couldn't have gone far, boss.

25:25.407 --> 25:26.797
Don't count on it.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.169
Franks?

25:30.168 --> 25:31.365
Franks?

25:41.200 --> 25:43.431
Couldn't find a broom closet.

25:45.697 --> 25:47.483
How do you know Carver?

25:48.354 --> 25:52.001
Just another spook from the old
days that made my job difficult.

25:52.025 --> 25:55.279
You never mentioned you made
a backup copy of that file.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.677
It was a long time ago, probie.

25:56.701 --> 25:58.219
Is it enough?

25:58.313 --> 25:59.796
Should do the trick.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.048
What's in it?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.425
Where'd you learn to be
such a pain in the ass?

26:04.449 --> 26:06.092
Working with you.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.873
There's a lot of people who want
to see what's in that file, Mike.

26:09.897 --> 26:11.819
Guess they're going to be disappointed.

26:12.490 --> 26:14.184
There's nothing to see.

26:15.556 --> 26:17.939
But there's plenty to listen to.

26:18.437 --> 26:20.140
Vale was wearing a wire?

26:20.164 --> 26:23.587
And I was on the other end
of it listening to every word.

26:23.611 --> 26:24.785
Dubbed a copy.

26:24.809 --> 26:27.366
I tell what I heard,
audiotape backs me up

26:27.390 --> 26:29.021
and everybody's happy

26:29.045 --> 26:30.648
except for Nikolai.

26:30.672 --> 26:31.851
Where's the tape?

26:31.875 --> 26:32.580
Safe.

26:32.604 --> 26:34.141
How safe?

26:34.596 --> 26:38.193
Safe enough that no one's
found it for 15 years.

26:38.607 --> 26:40.349
This director...

26:41.609 --> 26:43.422
she's okay, I guess, but...

26:43.446 --> 26:44.877
I get the feeling that...

26:44.901 --> 26:47.502
you've been working
under her a little too long.

26:47.526 --> 26:50.290
The world's changing, Mike.

26:51.381 --> 26:54.806
All the lines are
getting blurred, probie.

26:55.308 --> 26:58.649
Hard for a man not to step over them.

26:59.007 --> 27:02.849
And you can call off
this protection detail.

27:03.191 --> 27:06.113
- I can take care of myself just fine.
- No, I can't do that, Mike.

27:06.137 --> 27:08.654
All you have to be is half a
second slower and you're dead.

27:08.678 --> 27:13.642
Or the other guy just has to be a half-second
faster just like it's always been.

27:15.186 --> 27:17.096
I found him, boss!

27:18.200 --> 27:20.254
Nice work, DiNozzo.

27:28.699 --> 27:32.374
No Italian restaurants. Must have
eaten somewhere else and driven here.

27:32.398 --> 27:34.073
It couldn't have been this public.

27:34.097 --> 27:36.714
You don't shoot someone where
everyone can see you, do you?

27:36.738 --> 27:37.936
I never do.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.592
Unless, of course, it can't be helped.

27:41.880 --> 27:45.169
Alleys, service lanes, parking lots.

27:47.631 --> 27:48.996
You hear that?

27:49.899 --> 27:51.133
What am I listening for?

27:51.157 --> 27:53.096
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

27:54.363 --> 27:56.450
That's Abby's mystery sound.

28:03.172 --> 28:05.211
That explains all the coins.

28:05.288 --> 28:06.498
Coin counter.

28:06.522 --> 28:09.292
Vale must have been waiting
to use it when he saw Nikolai.

28:09.316 --> 28:10.677
In the market?

28:11.219 --> 28:13.843
Even arms dealers need groceries.

28:14.169 --> 28:17.546
Okay, so he made the 911 call,

28:18.753 --> 28:20.552
followed Nikolai...

28:22.761 --> 28:24.632
into the parking lot.

28:26.941 --> 28:28.435
Ground zero.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.916
I got puke.

28:44.783 --> 28:47.038
That's a lot of regurgitation.

28:47.172 --> 28:48.490
It doesn't look fresh.

28:48.514 --> 28:50.433
It doesn't smell fresh.

28:50.502 --> 28:52.043
Does it ever?

28:52.466 --> 28:53.640
That could be blood.

28:53.664 --> 28:56.412
Or the Colonel's special dipping sauce.

28:57.764 --> 28:58.977
Ah!

28:59.667 --> 29:01.738
Well, we could toss a coin.

29:02.965 --> 29:04.290
Or not.

29:04.408 --> 29:06.238
All right, give me some gloves.

29:08.845 --> 29:10.119
You didn't pack the gloves.

29:10.143 --> 29:12.410
I thought you packed the gloves.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.987
I didn't pack the gloves.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.259
Give me something.

29:29.496 --> 29:30.661
Uh!

29:30.939 --> 29:32.733
There's nothing here.

29:33.324 --> 29:34.263
Hey!

29:34.287 --> 29:35.452
Ugh!

29:35.947 --> 29:38.675
Uh, you have a tissue or something?

29:40.876 --> 29:43.452
We have got to buy some gloves.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.626
This is going to be a long day.

30:20.051 --> 30:21.397
Need-to-know basis,

30:21.421 --> 30:23.308
and this one you didn't need to know.

30:24.944 --> 30:26.518
How well you know Carver?

30:26.603 --> 30:30.730
- Um, been with Homeland Security since the startup.
- Before that?

30:31.665 --> 30:32.274
NSA?

30:32.298 --> 30:33.840
Try CIA.

30:34.198 --> 30:38.177
In '91, he was trying to get a sneak
peek at top-secret Soviet hardware

30:38.201 --> 30:41.738
which links him directly
to Puchenko and Kobach.

30:43.067 --> 30:44.578
Sounds speculative.

30:44.602 --> 30:46.192
And if I'm right?

30:47.103 --> 30:49.023
If you're right, it probably was Carver

30:49.047 --> 30:52.242
who tipped off Kobach and Puchenko when
we were going to arrest them in '91.

30:52.266 --> 30:56.268
Hey, and look who pops up
to get Nikolai off the hook.

30:56.506 --> 31:00.142
The CIA has a shopping
list, Carver is the buyer.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.759
I want him taken out of the loop.

31:03.783 --> 31:08.609
You don't seriously think that Carver's
leaking information to Kobach on Mike Franks.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.301
He did it in '91.

31:10.325 --> 31:11.936
No Mike, no case.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.722
Puchenko walks, probably
right into a deal with Carver.

31:14.746 --> 31:15.746
Jen.

31:15.867 --> 31:17.361
Listen to me.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.128
Take him off the
need-to-know list.

31:22.392 --> 31:24.895
Too late. Carver's already been briefed.

31:36.735 --> 31:38.579
You're supposed to be
inside the house, Mike.

31:38.603 --> 31:40.184
Nice catch.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.472
I must be getting sloppy.

31:41.496 --> 31:43.684
Well, I smelled the cigarette smoke.

31:43.708 --> 31:45.576
I can smoke inside if you want.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.503
I don't think that's a good idea.

31:47.527 --> 31:48.604
Nope.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.051
- Hello.
- DiNozzo, it's Gibbs.

31:54.075 --> 31:55.670
Oh, hey, boss, we were
just talking about you.

31:55.694 --> 31:57.141
We got a security problem.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.751
Time to go off script. Where's Franks?

31:58.775 --> 32:00.037
He's right...

32:04.022 --> 32:05.163
Mike?

32:06.475 --> 32:07.475
Mike?

32:09.288 --> 32:10.292
Tony?

32:11.276 --> 32:12.493
DiNozzo?

32:12.715 --> 32:13.864
Tony!

32:25.089 --> 32:26.636
I lose any hair?

32:26.660 --> 32:27.719
No.

32:27.743 --> 32:28.644
- How is he?
- He'll live.

32:28.668 --> 32:31.444
Well, I've been hit
harder, boss, by you.

32:34.107 --> 32:35.456
How many were there?

32:35.998 --> 32:37.024
I didn't see.

32:37.048 --> 32:38.364
Came up real fast from behind.

32:38.388 --> 32:41.165
The rest of our guys deployed from
the house in less than 30 seconds.

32:41.189 --> 32:42.536
But they were already gone.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.769
With Mike?

32:45.153 --> 32:49.417
There must have been two teams. One to
take me down, and the other to snatch him.

32:49.441 --> 32:51.976
Whoever did it, they were good.

32:52.583 --> 32:53.992
Sorry, boss.

32:54.979 --> 32:55.709
So...

32:55.733 --> 32:58.989
why grab him when all
they had to do was kill him?

32:59.612 --> 33:01.418
He was holding evidence.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.508
Where?

33:02.532 --> 33:03.812
He wouldn't tell me.

33:03.836 --> 33:06.865
Well, I guess you didn't hold a
blowtorch to his eyeballs to find out.

33:06.889 --> 33:08.575
These guys will.

33:08.749 --> 33:10.195
Yeah. Gibbs.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.739
Tell her I'm on my way.

33:14.252 --> 33:15.364
Jenny?

33:18.680 --> 33:20.045
"Jenny?"

33:21.044 --> 33:22.695
Just, uh..

33:22.719 --> 33:25.521
How cozy did you two get

33:25.545 --> 33:27.255
while I was away?

33:29.590 --> 33:31.659
Well, that knock to the head must
have been harder than I thought,

33:31.683 --> 33:34.828
'cause I'm saying crazy things
that I don't even understand.

33:34.852 --> 33:36.450
You think she's single?

33:38.623 --> 33:39.892
He's fine.

33:43.897 --> 33:45.644
People should really
chew their food more.

33:45.668 --> 33:47.759
And drink in moderation.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.133
What's that look like?

33:54.870 --> 33:56.403
Not puke.

34:03.898 --> 34:05.053
Blood.

34:07.062 --> 34:09.501
This Dumpster could have
just been moved here.

34:23.529 --> 34:24.891
You didn't waste any time.

34:24.916 --> 34:26.435
Bad news travels fast.

34:26.458 --> 34:28.080
Especially in this town.

34:28.623 --> 34:29.980
How's your agent?

34:32.350 --> 34:33.223
Do you really give a damn?

34:33.246 --> 34:35.967
- Any update on Mike Franks?
- No.

34:36.414 --> 34:38.757
You expect to find him, Agent Gibbs?

34:39.099 --> 34:41.273
He's a resourceful man.

34:41.471 --> 34:42.681
No doubt.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.704
In the meantime, I'd like Nikolai
Puchenko released into my custody.

34:45.728 --> 34:46.889
I'm not finished with him.

34:46.914 --> 34:48.984
But you are, Agent Gibbs.

34:49.485 --> 34:52.949
Perhaps your time would be better
spent finding out who in your department

34:52.973 --> 34:56.440
leaked the location of the safe house
where you were keeping your key witness.

34:56.464 --> 34:57.253
Did you?

34:57.277 --> 34:58.595
Gibbs.

34:59.378 --> 35:00.426
No.

35:00.592 --> 35:02.446
You did in '91.

35:05.415 --> 35:10.551
If you would like to have this request formalized,
Director Shepard, that can be arranged.

35:13.465 --> 35:17.798
I'm sure you didn't mean for that
to sound like a threat, Mr. Carver.

35:17.822 --> 35:21.027
But in the meantime, Mr. Puchenko
will remain in our custody

35:21.051 --> 35:24.915
pending our investigation into
the disappearance of Mike Franks.

35:24.939 --> 35:27.384
I think you need to look closer to home.

35:27.408 --> 35:29.099
Maybe there was no leak.

35:29.123 --> 35:31.628
Maybe Franks just lost
his nerve and ran away.

35:31.652 --> 35:33.575
Or Kobach met his asking price.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.622
You don't know Mike Franks.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.842
And you really think you do?

35:39.210 --> 35:40.591
Director.

35:44.837 --> 35:48.903
You've got about an hour and then
all hell is going to break loose.

35:50.724 --> 35:52.073
Jethro...

35:54.968 --> 35:58.437
I really hope you know Mike
Franks as well as you think you do.

36:16.389 --> 36:18.059
Marty Allen, please.

36:19.050 --> 36:21.104
Hello. Mr. Allen?

36:21.222 --> 36:22.545
Mike Franks.

36:22.569 --> 36:24.116
NCIS Mike Franks?

36:24.140 --> 36:25.359
One in the same.

36:25.383 --> 36:26.405
What can I do for you?

36:26.429 --> 36:30.477
I have something that your
client's associate, Arkady Kobach,

36:30.501 --> 36:32.368
might be interested in buying.

36:32.392 --> 36:34.381
What might that be?

36:34.588 --> 36:37.469
A one-off copy of the audio tape

36:37.643 --> 36:41.557
that will send him and your
client to prison for 30 years.

36:41.923 --> 36:44.186
If he's interested,
what would the price be?

36:44.416 --> 36:46.407
$500,000.

36:46.431 --> 36:48.157
You get the tape,

36:48.315 --> 36:52.818
and I get to go back to Mexico and retire with
a sweet little waitress named Camila Charo.

36:52.842 --> 36:54.706
I'll have to contact my client.

36:54.730 --> 36:56.252
Can I get back to you?

36:56.276 --> 36:58.163
Sure. You got a pen?

37:00.516 --> 37:01.102
Hey,

37:01.126 --> 37:02.965
- what kept him?
- Business.

37:02.989 --> 37:05.115
God, I hate lawyers.

37:13.245 --> 37:15.926
I demand you release
my client, Agent Gibbs.

37:15.950 --> 37:18.110
You got no grounds to hold him. Your...

37:18.134 --> 37:20.629
key witness has disappeared.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.653
You have no case.

37:22.971 --> 37:25.328
Oh, you're right. I don't
have a case against your client

37:25.352 --> 37:26.813
for arms dealing.

37:28.766 --> 37:30.981
But I do have one for murder.

37:37.711 --> 37:39.089
We deserve a medal.

37:39.113 --> 37:40.431
That look...

37:40.508 --> 37:42.920
is as close as you're
ever going to get, probie.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.381
Nikolai, you have a choice.

37:47.778 --> 37:51.420
You can spend the rest of your life
in prison, or you can cut a deal.

37:53.216 --> 37:54.998
And you can tell me...

37:55.357 --> 37:57.916
where to find your friend, Arkady.

38:05.636 --> 38:07.863
Clear.

38:08.646 --> 38:09.726
Clear.

38:10.846 --> 38:11.375
McGee.

38:11.399 --> 38:14.996
Smoke's from a Russian cigarette.
Arkady hasn't been gone long.

38:15.218 --> 38:16.840
Come on, double time.

38:26.439 --> 38:27.673
Okay, we're on.

38:27.697 --> 38:30.014
Ten calls made in the last day.

38:30.038 --> 38:31.705
Three in the last hour and a half.

38:31.729 --> 38:33.801
First was to a cell phone, Marty Allen.

38:33.825 --> 38:36.418
Second call was to Merchant Bank.

38:36.442 --> 38:37.885
The last call...

38:37.909 --> 38:41.074
was to a hotel in the
port district El Ejecutivo.

38:41.098 --> 38:42.613
Call was made to room seven.

38:42.637 --> 38:46.695
Mexican hotel. Names and numbers,
McGee, starting with the hotel.

38:51.285 --> 38:52.367
Are you sure?

38:52.391 --> 38:54.107
That's what the manager said.

38:54.131 --> 38:57.265
Room seven is booked in
the name of a Camila Charo,

38:57.289 --> 39:01.283
but it was not a woman that paid cash
for the room. It was some old guy.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.134
Franks's brand.

39:35.887 --> 39:37.372
Beer's cold.

39:38.452 --> 39:40.490
But they're all out of lime.

39:42.282 --> 39:44.906
I sent the bar man to buy some.

39:45.921 --> 39:47.856
I told him to take his time.

40:01.675 --> 40:03.473
You've got what I want?

40:06.180 --> 40:08.034
And I've got what you want.

40:10.917 --> 40:12.676
Truth is, Arkady...

40:12.700 --> 40:14.755
you've got nothing I want.

40:15.794 --> 40:18.506
You think you are the
first to point a gun at me?

40:18.667 --> 40:19.832
No.

40:19.966 --> 40:22.125
No, but I will be the last.

41:01.613 --> 41:03.571
I knew he was over there.

41:04.583 --> 41:06.565
I figured I could take them both.

41:07.404 --> 41:08.967
Arkady first,

41:08.991 --> 41:10.544
then the big guy.

41:11.448 --> 41:13.924
Maybe I am a half second slower.

41:13.948 --> 41:16.051
There was no leak, was there?

41:18.052 --> 41:19.631
DiNozzo okay?

41:19.655 --> 41:20.788
Boss?

41:20.962 --> 41:22.126
Clear!

41:26.881 --> 41:28.366
Secure the room.

41:50.686 --> 41:52.829
You set yourself up as bait.

41:54.321 --> 41:55.315
The bigger the bait,

41:55.339 --> 41:57.179
the bigger the fish you catch.

41:58.577 --> 42:02.475
Arkady never would have got to
court, probie, and you know it.

42:03.354 --> 42:08.114
Carver or whoever else is pulling the
strings would have made sure of that.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.190
Another crappy deal.

42:10.348 --> 42:12.599
More innocent people die.

42:13.245 --> 42:15.539
If you think I'm not
going to sleep well tonight

42:15.563 --> 42:18.682
because of what I just
did, then you're wrong.

42:19.585 --> 42:22.297
I'm going to sleep like a baby,

42:22.326 --> 42:27.524
because Arkady Kobach was a scary S.O.B.

42:27.548 --> 42:31.560
who kept me awake nights
for the past 15 years.

42:31.584 --> 42:33.919
Someone else will take his place.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.849
That's your problem, probie.

42:37.319 --> 42:39.069
I got my guy.

42:41.048 --> 42:42.134
Hey.

42:43.614 --> 42:45.468
You got that audio tape?

42:48.988 --> 42:50.630
Beer's getting warm.
