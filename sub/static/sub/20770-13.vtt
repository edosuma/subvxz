WEBVTT

02:17.471 --> 02:18.514
Come in!

02:21.058 --> 02:22.560
- Oh!
- How you doing?

02:22.685 --> 02:24.687
Our new favorite
insurance agency!

02:24.812 --> 02:28.023
Oh, my God, Battling Bud,
you're the man!

02:28.149 --> 02:31.068
Looks like you boys
made quite a night of it.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.989
Dougie, you might
want to call your wife.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.240
Wife?

02:39.743 --> 02:42.705
Bushnell, we come bearing gifts,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.832
tokens of our gratitude to you.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.750
What is all this?

02:46.876 --> 02:49.753
A box of Montecristo Number Twos.

02:49.879 --> 02:50.963
Oh, nice.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.507
A set...

02:54.383 --> 02:57.011
...of monogrammed
diamond cuff links.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.470
Oh, they're beautiful.

03:04.602 --> 03:07.396
And the keys to your new car!

03:08.981 --> 03:10.816
A BMW convertible.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.569
Now you and Dougie
have a matched set.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.237
Fellas...

03:15.362 --> 03:16.864
I am speechless.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.490
Oh!

03:18.616 --> 03:21.327
A wrong
has been made right,

03:21.452 --> 03:22.995
and the sun
is shining bright.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.706
Ah, thank you, fellas.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.483
I-I have no idea
what happened, Mr. Todd.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.907
Well, this is most unfortunate.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.243
I agree.
I don't know what to say.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.370
<i>But you know what to do.</i>

04:04.495 --> 04:06.080
We talked about this.

04:07.039 --> 04:10.000
I am giving you one day

04:10.125 --> 04:11.502
to remedy this situation.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.003
But you said two before.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.631
One day.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.801
<i>Do we have
a complete understanding?</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:20.219
Yes, sir.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.151
Roger.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.320
Roger, get in here, please.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.290
Hold on just a minute.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.502
Mrs. Jones?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.586
Yeah?

04:54.712 --> 04:56.797
Uh, where do you
want it set up?

04:56.922 --> 04:58.132
W-what?

04:59.675 --> 05:01.635
Sonny Jim's new gym set,

05:01.760 --> 05:03.804
courtesy of
the Mitchum brothers.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.736
And the car too?

05:18.861 --> 05:19.987
Mitchum brothers.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.531
Where do you want the gym?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.119
Backyard?

05:27.244 --> 05:28.620
All right.
Guys!

05:28.746 --> 05:30.414
Let's go.
The backyard.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.593
Oh, Dougie.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.220
When you didn't
come home last night,

06:26.345 --> 06:27.930
I thought the worst.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.266
Look what you've done.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.396
Sonny Jim's
in seventh heaven.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.233
- Seven heaven.
- Mm.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.781
And then the car...

06:48.075 --> 06:49.410
Oh, Dougie...

06:51.161 --> 06:53.414
...I love you so much.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.741
Fuck.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.118
Fuck.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.288
What's the problem, Ray?

07:34.413 --> 07:35.497
I killed that guy.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.584
He's the one
I told you about.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.005
You didn't kill him
too good, Ray.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.174
I will now.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.886
<i>Hey, Ray,
you in here somewhere?</i>

07:49.011 --> 07:50.512
And how
did he get the code?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.264
I gave it to him.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.474
<i>Came to see you, buddy.</i>

07:53.599 --> 07:54.850
But only to the door.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.812
So he's trapped.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.647
And mine.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.357
All right.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.817
I'll let you have him.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.987
I want to have
some fun with him first.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.448
Bring him up!

08:13.327 --> 08:15.496
Get in the elevator.

08:46.652 --> 08:48.195
Put the gun away, Ray.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.881
What do we have here?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.468
I came to see my friend Ray.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.805
I'm here...

09:14.930 --> 09:15.806
you fuck.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.893
Settle down, Ray.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.437
Looks like we got ourselves
a new contestant here.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.401
Tell him how it works, Muddy.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.321
Real simple.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.032
This man is our boss...

09:35.951 --> 09:38.370
...'cause no one can beat him
at arm wrestling.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.626
Imagine all the men
who've tried.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.462
Many, many.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.631
In 14 years,

09:49.756 --> 09:52.217
no one's ever even come close.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.928
Any new guy gets one chance.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.431
One chance.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.058
And if you lose,

10:00.183 --> 10:02.394
Renzo's your boss.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.188
So you can leave now.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.026
If you stay and lose

10:09.151 --> 10:11.445
and you do not do
what Renzo says...

10:12.988 --> 10:14.573
...you die.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.326
So you decide.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.745
Stay and play the game.
It's your choice.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.581
Looking at you,

10:22.706 --> 10:24.833
I'd say you better leave.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.632
What is this,

10:31.757 --> 10:32.966
kindergarten?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.179
Nursery school?

10:42.184 --> 10:43.977
What do I get if I win?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.983
Then you'd be our boss.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.653
I don't want to be your boss.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.657
But if I win,
I want him.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.961
Step inside.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.546
Let's play the game.

11:37.864 --> 11:41.034
That was from
the nursery-school teacher.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.052
Sit down.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.835
Rules!

12:31.960 --> 12:33.545
Starting position.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.132
Wrestling arm on table.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.887
Yeah.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.764
Doesn't know what he got into.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.517
Other hand
cannot touch table.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.061
Hands up!

12:51.938 --> 12:53.273
Grip!

13:07.287 --> 13:09.498
Do not start until I say.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.667
You ready, boss?

13:12.793 --> 13:14.461
Ready.

13:16.129 --> 13:16.963
You ready?

13:17.088 --> 13:19.424
Ready.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.426
Look at him.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.512
Yeah, he's ready.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.388
He's not ready.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.352
Commence arm wrestle!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.367
Ain't touching yet!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.953
Take him out!

13:48.078 --> 13:49.704
Take him down!

13:55.210 --> 13:56.294
Starting positions.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.963
Come on.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.631
- Come on, boss.
- Boss, what are you doing?

13:59.756 --> 14:00.966
Come on,
stop playing around, boss.

14:01.091 --> 14:04.052
Yeah.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.522
- Don't play around, boss.
- Come on, finish him.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.148
Come on, do it!

14:22.279 --> 14:24.239
Starting position's
more comfortable.

14:27.576 --> 14:28.994
Come on, man!

14:30.579 --> 14:31.580
Come on, boss!
Get him!

14:31.705 --> 14:34.291
Don't you fucking move, Ray!

14:34.416 --> 14:36.585
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, boss.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.587
Bring it back,
bring it back, bring it back.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.755
Come on, come on.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.225
It hurt my arm when
you moved it down here.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.023
But it really hurt
when you had it down here.

15:11.077 --> 15:11.953
See?

15:13.663 --> 15:16.124
Doesn't that hurt your arm
when I go like that?

15:18.209 --> 15:21.212
I think it's much worse
when it's down here.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.799
Ah, fuck.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.262
Let's go back
to starting positions.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.350
It's really
much more comfortable.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.939
Take him out now!

15:39.064 --> 15:40.065
You best stay here.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.609
- Finish him!
- Come on!

15:46.738 --> 15:48.531
Take him out! Come on!

15:49.699 --> 15:52.118
Oh, shit!

15:52.243 --> 15:54.454
Oh!

16:00.835 --> 16:02.212
Grab him.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.505
Stand up, stand up.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.216
- Stand up, stay there.
- Shit.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.266
He's all yours, boss.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.269
Give me some cell phones.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.483
Y-you're not gonna get
any reception up here, boss.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.541
Ray and I are gonna need
some privacy.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.629
He's all yours, boss.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.902
Can we talk about this?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.115
Aah!

17:12.240 --> 17:13.491
Gaah!

17:20.290 --> 17:22.042
Now we can talk.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.396
Do you need any money?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.401
No.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.377
Somebody hired you
to kill me.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.254
Who is it?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.176
I can make you tell me.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.386
I know it.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.892
It came through a man
named Phillip Jeffries.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.479
At least that's
the name he gives.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.980
I never met him.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.775
I only talked to him
on the phone.

18:31.903 --> 18:32.946
Keep talking.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.700
He set the whole prison thing up
with Warden Murphy.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.248
Jeffries says
you were gonna kill me.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.459
He said I could get out

18:46.584 --> 18:48.628
and stay out
if I killed you first.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.798
Why?

18:55.426 --> 18:59.681
He said that you got
something inside that they want.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.152
Did he ever mention
Major Briggs?

19:14.237 --> 19:15.071
No.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.658
Easy, Ray.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.494
You know I don't have a gun.

19:21.619 --> 19:22.996
I got to show you something.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.338
Oh.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.970
Jeffries said I was
supposed to put this on you...

19:40.847 --> 19:42.307
...after I killed you.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.895
Where did you get that?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.273
It was given to me...

19:50.398 --> 19:52.984
right before I walked
out of my cell and saw you.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.820
Who gave it to you?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.200
A guard.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.202
I don't know.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.790
He was dressed as a guard,
but I'd never seen him before.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.715
<i>Put it on</i>‒
<i>ring finger, left hand.</i>

20:30.271 --> 20:31.314
Now...

20:33.024 --> 20:34.734
...you know what I want, Ray.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.448
You want the coordinates
I got from Hastings?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.743
Rather, his pretty secretary,
Betty?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.704
Do you really think
I'm gonna give them to you?

20:47.872 --> 20:51.084
You really think you could even
trust the numbers I give you?

20:54.170 --> 20:56.130
I know who you are.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.764
Can I reach in my pocket?

21:06.474 --> 21:08.518
Depends on what's
in the pocket.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.436
The numbers, stupid.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.105
I have the coordinates
written out.

21:12.230 --> 21:13.398
They're in my pocket.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.587
<i>Here.</i>

21:48.641 --> 21:50.810
Ray, where is
Phillip Jeffries?

21:52.812 --> 21:53.855
I don't know.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.776
Ray, where's
Phillip Jeffries?

22:02.655 --> 22:03.990
Last I heard,

22:04.115 --> 22:06.534
he was at a place
called The Dutchman's,

22:06.659 --> 22:08.328
but it's not a real place.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.249
I know what it is.

23:26.364 --> 23:28.866
No.
You went too far.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.868
It's‒it's about
two blocks back.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.497
Try to make a U-turn.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.458
Okay, then jus‒

23:37.583 --> 23:39.502
Go around the block.
You just missed it.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.049
Yeah.
I'll tell him.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.551
All right.
Bye, Mom.

23:46.676 --> 23:47.802
Drive careful.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.014
Mom wants us to come
to Sunday dinner.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.600
Hopes there's
no murders this weekend.

23:54.725 --> 23:57.437
Fat chance that's gonna happen.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.650
Hey, hey, hey!
She can't piss on the floor!

24:02.775 --> 24:05.027
Get her out of here!

24:05.153 --> 24:06.571
She's still pissing, Phil.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.323
Cocksuckers!
I'll shit in your mouth!

24:09.449 --> 24:10.408
I'll get her.

24:11.701 --> 24:12.827
And she's got a knife!

24:12.952 --> 24:14.203
Fuck you, Twinkies!

24:14.328 --> 24:15.621
I'll cut your nuts off!

24:15.746 --> 24:17.165
Tase her, Tase her!

24:17.290 --> 24:18.624
Phil, Tase her!

24:26.924 --> 24:28.551
Get her out of here.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.846
We want to report a cop!

24:31.971 --> 24:34.557
Take a seat, ma'am.
I'll be with you in a minute.

24:34.682 --> 24:38.728
Got the prints
on our pal Douglas Jones.

24:38.853 --> 24:39.896
Oh.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.522
According to AFIS,
he escaped

24:41.647 --> 24:45.318
from a high-security prison
in South Dakota two days ago.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.528
- What?
- No, it gets better.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.572
He's a missing FBI agent.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.493
That...

24:53.618 --> 24:55.620
That's a huge fucking mistake!

24:55.745 --> 24:58.039
What?

24:58.164 --> 24:59.665
- A dollar?
- Oh, go for it.

24:59.790 --> 25:00.708
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:00.833 --> 25:01.751
Sure.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.712
- Oh!
- Ah!

25:04.837 --> 25:06.088
Oh!

25:06.214 --> 25:07.715
All right, all right.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.383
Ex‒excuse me?

25:09.509 --> 25:11.302
I-I'm looking
for Detective Clark.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.554
Yeah, he's out back,
grabbing a smoke.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.014
Just through the doors.

25:16.557 --> 25:17.850
Okay.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.144
Thank you.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.234
Hey.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.944
F-fuck.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.946
- What are you doing?
- I have to ask you a question.

25:30.071 --> 25:31.197
You know you're not
supposed to come here.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.949
I have to ask you a question.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.742
Better be good.

25:34.867 --> 25:35.785
It is.

25:37.703 --> 25:41.332
I need to know a good poison
I could use‒

25:41.457 --> 25:42.500
undetectable.

25:45.253 --> 25:46.254
You shit.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.213
What?

25:48.965 --> 25:50.091
Aconitine.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.052
Crime labs are
getting wise to it,

25:53.177 --> 25:54.178
but it's your best bet.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.389
Where do I get it?

25:56.514 --> 25:59.267
By paying me
top fucking dollar, cowboy.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.227
Why are you so against me?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.854
'Cause you're
a weak fucking coward.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.648
It makes me sick
just to look at you.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.029
I'm trying to keep
this whole operation

26:12.154 --> 26:13.698
from falling apart.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.910
Somebody's onto us.
That's why I need the stuff.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.456
It's gonna cost you.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.958
Five...

26:24.083 --> 26:25.084
thousand.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.336
It'll do the job,

26:27.461 --> 26:29.213
give you two hours
to get away.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.674
It's perfect for
a chickenshit punk like you.

26:32.717 --> 26:33.801
I'll get the money.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.641
9:30 tonight,

26:40.766 --> 26:42.810
outside of Crosley's,

26:42.935 --> 26:44.604
at the back door.

26:53.696 --> 26:54.780
What's up?

26:57.283 --> 26:58.242
He's cracking.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.788
The fuck wants
to poison someone.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.249
I'll call Mr. Todd.

27:06.834 --> 27:07.793
Yeah.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.064
Utah.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.649
Mormons.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.485
They don't drink liquor.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.029
They don't drink coffee.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.365
They don't drink Coca-Cola.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.909
And...

27:40.034 --> 27:42.536
they don't even
have sex before marriage.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.247
Yeah, but when
they do get married,

27:45.373 --> 27:47.792
I heard they can‒
they can marry, like,

27:47.917 --> 27:49.627
six or ten women.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.255
Funny there's
not more of them.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.176
I guess it's the drinks.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.974
Oh, Dougie.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.840
Good morning, Dougie.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.425
What do you say

30:01.550 --> 30:04.011
to a nice hot
cup of coffee?

30:05.387 --> 30:06.722
Coffee.

30:06.847 --> 30:07.890
It's on me.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.767
Coffee for the great
Dougie Jones.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.186
Dougie Jones.

30:18.651 --> 30:19.777
Here you go.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.000
Mm.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.798
Ahh.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.750
Hon, you want
some cherry pie?

31:59.752 --> 32:01.754
Cherry pie.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.298
Go sit down.
I'll bring you a slice.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.553
Go enjoy your coffee.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.974
Coffee.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.726
Don't worry
about it, okay?

32:54.890 --> 32:56.642
Dougie...

32:56.767 --> 32:58.310
there's your coffee.

32:59.103 --> 33:01.230
Your coffee.

33:04.358 --> 33:05.818
Oh, God!

33:05.943 --> 33:08.320
So sorry.
I never meant to hurt anyone.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.183
Here's your cherry pie.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.198
Oh, oh...

33:56.452 --> 33:57.953
That bad, huh?

34:03.751 --> 34:06.086
Dougie!

34:06.211 --> 34:07.963
Dougie, I'm so sorry!

34:08.088 --> 34:09.548
So sorry!

34:11.300 --> 34:12.801
Mm.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.473
Mm.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.662
Hey, Becky.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.539
Mom...

34:43.624 --> 34:46.043
Steven never came home
last night.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.711
That's two nights
that he's been gone.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.463
That's two days, Mom.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.758
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

34:52.883 --> 34:54.843
<i>I'm really worried.</i>

34:54.968 --> 34:57.054
Well, maybe he just
needs some time.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.473
I don't know. I think he's
going through something bad.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.767
I can feel it.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.228
Okay, honey,
can we talk about this later?

35:04.353 --> 35:05.979
Hungry customers.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.440
Sure.

35:12.778 --> 35:13.779
No, you know what?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.115
Why don't you come down here,

35:16.240 --> 35:17.407
and I'm gonna serve you up

35:17.533 --> 35:19.827
a beautiful piece of cherry pie,

35:19.952 --> 35:21.995
<i>a scoop of vanilla ice cream,</i>

35:22.121 --> 35:23.831
and lots of whipped cream.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.501
Oh...

35:27.626 --> 35:29.294
Damn, okay.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.879
Ah.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.631
That sounds so good.
Okay.

35:32.756 --> 35:33.841
Okay, I'll be right there.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.677
Okay, hurry up, and we'll find
some time to talk, okay?

35:36.802 --> 35:38.262
<i>Okay, thanks.
I love you.</i>

35:38.387 --> 35:39.388
I love you too.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.531
I‒

35:57.656 --> 35:58.824
I can't believe
what I've don‒

35:58.949 --> 35:59.950
I can't believe
what I've become.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.160
I tried poisoning Dougie.

36:01.285 --> 36:02.995
He saw right through me.
Oh, God.

36:03.120 --> 36:03.996
He was so kind about it.

36:04.121 --> 36:06.165
I can't believe
what I was about to do.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.292
I have to confess.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.919
Confess.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.047
I will, Dougie.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.048
I will.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.052
Bushnell...

36:20.512 --> 36:22.931
I've been selling you
down the river

36:23.056 --> 36:24.975
for months and months
for Duncan Todd.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.685
I've been working for Todd.

36:26.810 --> 36:27.644
I‒

36:29.771 --> 36:32.316
I've lied and cheated
for money.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.860
Anthony...

36:34.985 --> 36:36.153
Dougie already showed me.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.197
He explained
all this already.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.576
He did?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.703
Now that you're confessing,

36:44.828 --> 36:46.997
I have to admit
that my anger,

36:47.122 --> 36:49.374
my contempt for you

36:49.499 --> 36:51.001
is subsiding.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.298
Dougie even implicated himself.

36:56.423 --> 36:59.009
And he showed me
how you manipulated claims,

36:59.134 --> 37:00.761
and you cost me plenty.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.222
I trusted you, Anthony.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.849
I looked at you as my friend

37:05.974 --> 37:07.851
and my number one sales agent.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.561
Number one sales agent.

37:10.312 --> 37:11.772
How can I make it up to you?

37:11.897 --> 37:14.024
I'm so ashamed
of what I've done.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.277
And if it weren't for Dougie,

37:17.402 --> 37:19.196
I might have a murder
on my hands.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.782
Oh, my God,
what can I do?

37:23.242 --> 37:24.868
I was prepared
to send you away

37:24.993 --> 37:27.996
for a long, long time.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.414
Oh.

37:29.539 --> 37:30.999
But now...

37:31.124 --> 37:35.045
are you prepared to testify
against Duncan Todd?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.755
Y-yes.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.590
Y-yes.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.509
Yes, even if
I die in the process.

37:40.634 --> 37:42.636
I haven't slept for weeks.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.055
I vomited blood.
I can't live like this.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.349
I only want
to die or change.

37:47.474 --> 37:48.642
Bushnell, please help me.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.978
I only want to make things
right again.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.817
And these two cops
that Dougie found?

37:58.151 --> 38:00.487
Wha‒
He knows about them too?

38:01.947 --> 38:02.990
Them too.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.955
They're worse than Todd.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.665
You don't know
what you're asking.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.208
Oh...

38:13.333 --> 38:16.628
I'm not really asking,
Anthony.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.632
I-I only want to fix

38:20.757 --> 38:22.050
this mess I made.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.724
Dougie saved my life.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.560
Thank you, Dougie.

38:32.686 --> 38:33.729
Thank Dougie.

38:36.982 --> 38:37.983
Thank you.

38:41.111 --> 38:42.154
Thank you.

38:52.956 --> 38:54.249
How are you?

38:54.374 --> 38:56.710
- How are you?
- Hanging in.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.046
I will have the usual.

38:59.171 --> 39:00.339
Okay.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.593
- Get that right up for you.
- Thanks.

39:04.718 --> 39:06.011
Yeah, no problem.

39:14.478 --> 39:15.687
Hey, Norma.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.689
Shelly go home already?

39:17.814 --> 39:19.232
Yeah, she did.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.401
Oh, okay.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.280
I'll leave you two.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.200
No, no, come
and have some dinner.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.077
I just ordered.
Thanks.

39:31.828 --> 39:33.789
Bobby, get your butt
back over here.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.874
It's no good eating alone.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.213
Thanks.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.511
So...

39:49.096 --> 39:50.389
...what's new, Deputy?

39:51.473 --> 39:52.891
Oh, well,

39:53.016 --> 39:56.895
we, uh, found some stuff
that my dad left today.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.397
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.608
What kind of stuff?

40:02.651 --> 40:04.778
Don't know yet,
but it...

40:05.904 --> 40:06.988
Something.

40:07.114 --> 40:09.199
- Oh.
- You know?

40:11.701 --> 40:12.828
Oh.

40:12.953 --> 40:13.870
Thanks.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.209
We're gonna
check it out, though.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.377
I'll tell you that.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.548
I'll go bring
your dinner, Ed.

40:26.216 --> 40:27.300
Hey?

40:27.426 --> 40:28.593
You want me to move
to another booth?

40:28.718 --> 40:30.804
So you guys can...?

40:30.929 --> 40:33.181
No reason, pal.
Nothing happening here.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.978
- There you go.
- Thanks, babe.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.020
Hey, you.

40:40.730 --> 40:41.731
Hey, girl.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.277
- Hey.
- Mm.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.075
Oh...

40:52.200 --> 40:53.243
You two talk business.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.661
We'll move somewhere else.

41:00.625 --> 41:01.918
Good to see you, Walter.

41:02.669 --> 41:04.463
Oh, yeah.
Good to see you too.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.385
What's his name again?

41:10.510 --> 41:11.720
Ed.

41:11.845 --> 41:12.929
Ed Hurley.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.264
Oh, right, yeah.

41:15.515 --> 41:16.725
You're looking beautiful.

41:16.850 --> 41:18.101
Well, thanks.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.355
So, uh, to what
do I owe this pleasure?

41:22.481 --> 41:25.025
Norma, I had to make the drive

41:25.150 --> 41:27.944
'cause I got last month's
reports this morning,

41:28.069 --> 41:30.113
and I was so excited
to share them with you.

41:30.989 --> 41:31.823
Tell me.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.659
Hmm-mm.

41:37.579 --> 41:42.042
Three of our five
Norma's Double R franchises

41:42.167 --> 41:43.877
turned a profit.

41:45.212 --> 41:48.340
And that's a huge milestone
for such a new brand,

41:48.465 --> 41:50.842
particularly
when this whole region

41:50.967 --> 41:54.679
still faces such
uphill challenges economically.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.056
So that's good?

41:56.181 --> 41:57.891
That's very good.

42:03.939 --> 42:05.398
Looking at what's...

42:07.192 --> 42:09.152
Curiously,

42:09.277 --> 42:10.737
one of the two that's lagging

42:10.862 --> 42:12.322
is this one right here‒

42:12.447 --> 42:13.532
your flagship diner.

42:13.657 --> 42:14.908
Well, business always

42:15.033 --> 42:16.743
takes a little dip
this time of year.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.328
It's been going on
for a few months now.

42:18.453 --> 42:21.248
So I took the liberty

42:21.373 --> 42:23.416
of running
a point-of-sale analysis

42:23.542 --> 42:26.127
between this location
and the others.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.880
I-I can't really decipher that.

42:29.005 --> 42:30.257
Could you just tell me
what it means?

42:32.133 --> 42:33.718
In black and white,

42:33.843 --> 42:35.887
you're spending
too much per pie

42:36.012 --> 42:37.389
and not charging enough.

42:39.432 --> 42:40.767
Well, look, Walter,

42:40.892 --> 42:44.354
I wanted to say this
to you before. It's‒

42:44.479 --> 42:47.399
I-I've heard
from other people

42:47.524 --> 42:49.901
that they think that
our pies at the other locations

42:50.026 --> 42:53.154
are just not as good
as the ones we have here.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.114
I hear you.

42:54.239 --> 42:56.575
And I gave them
all my exact recipes,

42:56.700 --> 42:59.160
as per our agreement,

42:59.286 --> 43:01.204
but I don't think
they're following them.

43:01.329 --> 43:02.706
Norma, I assure you

43:02.831 --> 43:04.291
they're following
your recipes

43:04.416 --> 43:06.960
to the letter,
but also...

43:07.085 --> 43:09.421
per the agreement...

43:09.546 --> 43:11.840
...using their discretion about
where they get the ingredients.

43:11.965 --> 43:13.258
Mm, no.

43:13.383 --> 43:17.721
All my ingredients
are natural, organic, local.

43:17.846 --> 43:19.389
I know.
You make them with love.

43:19.514 --> 43:20.932
But this was our agreement.

43:22.142 --> 43:23.560
Norma...

43:23.685 --> 43:25.228
you're a real artist.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.647
But love doesn't always
turn a profit.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.483
We believe in you 100 percent,

43:30.609 --> 43:32.193
but from
a business perspective,

43:32.319 --> 43:35.447
the board would like you
to consider some alternatives

43:35.572 --> 43:37.782
without sacrificing
any of the high standards

43:37.907 --> 43:39.451
that you're so well-known for.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.581
Well, if you can explain
the alternatives,

43:44.706 --> 43:47.083
I'll‒I'll look into it.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.668
Well, look,
I-I don't mean to sound

43:48.793 --> 43:49.961
discouraging one little bit.

43:50.086 --> 43:51.421
This is all good news.

43:52.505 --> 43:54.341
It's just about
tweaking the formula

43:54.466 --> 43:57.636
to ensure consistency
and profitability.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.472
For instance,

44:00.597 --> 44:02.682
we think it's really time
you changed this name

44:02.807 --> 44:04.392
to Norma's Double R.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.397
You know, Walter,
in Twin Peaks,

44:09.522 --> 44:12.609
it's been the Double R Diner
for over 50 years,

44:12.734 --> 44:14.986
and that's
how people know it.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.322
No disrespect to the Double R,

44:17.447 --> 44:20.158
but you'll recall
our market research showed

44:20.283 --> 44:22.869
people responded
so much more favorably

44:22.994 --> 44:24.287
to your name‒

44:24.412 --> 44:27.332
Norma's Double R,
as it should be.

44:27.457 --> 44:29.334
You're the face
of the franchise.

44:34.631 --> 44:36.132
Are we on for dinner later?

44:37.092 --> 44:38.259
To celebrate?

44:41.721 --> 44:42.847
Yes, Walter.

44:46.726 --> 44:47.894
So...

44:48.019 --> 44:51.648
Okay, so, just in case...

45:40.405 --> 45:42.907
I'm sorry.
We're closed.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.367
Oh, my God!

45:44.492 --> 45:45.994
Oh.

45:46.119 --> 45:47.412
Dr. Jacoby.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.581
Nadine.

45:49.706 --> 45:51.666
- Is that you?
- It's me.

45:51.791 --> 45:53.793
Can I call you Dr. Amp?

45:53.918 --> 45:55.795
That's me.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.339
I usually leave
out the back.

45:58.465 --> 45:59.591
Oh, my God!

45:59.716 --> 46:01.885
I love your show so much.

46:02.010 --> 46:04.804
You have done so much for me.

46:04.929 --> 46:07.682
Well, I love your‒
your window display.

46:07.807 --> 46:08.892
Oh.

46:09.017 --> 46:10.310
Do you like it?

46:10.435 --> 46:12.687
- Oh, my God.
- Do you really like it?

46:12.812 --> 46:15.231
It‒it's magnificent.

46:15.356 --> 46:16.983
And those drapes

46:17.108 --> 46:20.111
are completely silent.

46:21.738 --> 46:24.908
This is my tribute
to you, Dr. Amp.

46:25.033 --> 46:26.284
Thanks to you,

46:26.409 --> 46:30.371
I am really starting
to shovel myself

46:30.497 --> 46:32.624
out of the shit!

46:32.749 --> 46:34.834
Oh, Nadine.

46:34.959 --> 46:38.046
That‒that just
means the world to me.

46:38.171 --> 46:39.631
It really does.

46:40.548 --> 46:42.008
You‒you know, it's‒

46:42.133 --> 46:43.426
it's us against them.

46:44.302 --> 46:48.973
And I am your most loyal
foot soldier...

46:49.098 --> 46:50.892
or...

46:51.017 --> 46:53.061
shoveler.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.107
You know, the...

46:58.233 --> 46:59.692
last‒last time I saw you,

46:59.818 --> 47:01.277
it was about seven years ago.

47:01.402 --> 47:02.487
- You...
- Mm.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.572
You were down
on your hands and knees,

47:04.697 --> 47:06.199
looking for a potato.

47:07.826 --> 47:09.118
Where was I?

47:09.244 --> 47:10.703
It was, uh, you know,
in the supermarket.

47:10.829 --> 47:12.413
You‒you had dropped it.

47:13.540 --> 47:15.583
It‒
There was a...

47:15.708 --> 47:17.418
a big storm that day.

47:22.382 --> 47:23.758
Oh.

47:31.015 --> 47:34.561
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

47:34.686 --> 47:37.647
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

47:38.898 --> 47:41.401
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

47:41.526 --> 47:44.279
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

47:44.404 --> 47:45.822
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

47:50.910 --> 47:53.371
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

47:53.496 --> 47:56.624
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

47:57.667 --> 48:00.378
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

48:00.503 --> 48:03.256
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

48:04.007 --> 48:06.384
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

48:09.888 --> 48:12.557
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

48:12.682 --> 48:15.435
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

48:15.560 --> 48:18.062
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

48:18.187 --> 48:21.316
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

48:21.441 --> 48:22.817
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

48:26.696 --> 48:29.240
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

48:29.365 --> 48:32.160
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

48:33.578 --> 48:35.204
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

48:36.289 --> 48:38.917
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

48:39.042 --> 48:41.252
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

48:46.716 --> 48:49.302
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

48:49.427 --> 48:52.263
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

48:54.265 --> 48:56.434
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

48:59.646 --> 49:02.982
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

49:03.107 --> 49:04.859
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

49:10.448 --> 49:13.117

49:13.242 --> 49:15.954

49:17.372 --> 49:19.916
<i>Oh, the gentleman

49:20.041 --> 49:22.961
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

49:23.086 --> 49:24.379
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

49:28.216 --> 49:31.010
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

49:31.135 --> 49:33.930
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

49:35.390 --> 49:37.809
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

49:37.934 --> 49:41.104
<i>Looks like, uh, round
number one and two under way.</i>

49:41.229 --> 49:43.815
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

49:47.318 --> 49:50.113
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

49:50.238 --> 49:52.949
<i>And he finally goes down,
hangs on to the ropes.</i>

50:00.873 --> 50:03.126
<i>Oh, the gentleman
asks him if he's okay.</i>

50:04.794 --> 50:06.379
<i>Now it's a boxing match again.</i>

50:10.174 --> 50:12.719
<i>Oh, the right hand
catches the big guy by the ear!</i>

50:14.762 --> 50:16.389
What did she say?

50:18.349 --> 50:20.143
Audrey...

50:20.268 --> 50:21.811
we've been over this.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.021
Tell me!

50:23.146 --> 50:24.731
Audrey.

50:25.523 --> 50:26.691
Stop it.

50:30.737 --> 50:31.571
I d‒

50:32.822 --> 50:35.283
I feel like I'm somewhere else.

50:35.408 --> 50:37.577
Have you ever had
that feeling, Charlie?

50:39.454 --> 50:40.455
No.

50:41.664 --> 50:43.124
Like I'm somewhere else

50:43.249 --> 50:44.542
and‒and like
I'm somebody else.

50:44.667 --> 50:45.960
Have you ever felt that?

50:46.085 --> 50:47.003
No.

50:48.838 --> 50:50.673
I always feel like myself.

50:51.466 --> 50:53.926
And it may not always
be the best feeling.

50:55.928 --> 50:58.514
Well, I'm not sure who I am,
but I'm not me.

51:00.975 --> 51:04.937
This is Existentialism 101.

51:05.063 --> 51:06.272
Oh, fuck you!

51:06.397 --> 51:07.356
I'm serious!

51:08.441 --> 51:11.027
Who am I supposed to trust
but myself?

51:11.152 --> 51:12.945
And I don't even know
who I am!

51:13.071 --> 51:15.448
So what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

51:17.450 --> 51:20.078
You're supposed to go
to the Roadhouse

51:20.203 --> 51:23.372
and see if Billy is there.

51:26.209 --> 51:27.293
I guess.

51:28.961 --> 51:29.962
Is it far?

51:30.713 --> 51:33.091
Come on, Audrey,
you know where it is.

51:34.008 --> 51:37.386
If I didn't know better,
I would swear you were on drugs.

51:37.512 --> 51:39.388
Just where is it?

51:39.514 --> 51:41.099
I'm gonna take you there.

51:42.642 --> 51:44.727
Now, are you gonna
stop playing games,

51:44.852 --> 51:47.021
or do I have to end your story too?

51:52.610 --> 51:54.695
What story is that, Charlie?

51:58.533 --> 52:00.243
Is that the story
of the little girl

52:00.368 --> 52:02.245
who lived down the lane?

52:04.455 --> 52:05.790
Is it?

52:16.634 --> 52:18.553
You're the one
that wanted to go.

52:21.722 --> 52:24.809
Now you're looking
like you want to stay.

52:26.769 --> 52:29.188
I want to stay,
and I want to go.

52:30.857 --> 52:32.150
I want to do both.

52:33.985 --> 52:35.528
Which will it be, Charlie?

52:35.653 --> 52:36.571
Hmm?

52:38.531 --> 52:39.949
Which one would you be?

52:43.953 --> 52:45.204
Charlie, help me.

52:45.329 --> 52:47.248
It's like Ghostwood here.

53:09.937 --> 53:11.856
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

53:11.981 --> 53:15.026
the Roadhouse
is proud to welcome
