26:41.121 --> 26:43.993
It's the role you hired me for.

26:45.952 --> 26:48.519
You were late, uh,
getting home yesterday.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.522
Um, where did you go?

26:51.566 --> 26:53.437
I had a dress fitting
in Bel Air.

26:53.481 --> 26:54.787
Liar.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.789
I checked your car's odometer.

26:56.832 --> 27:00.401
You drove three times that far.

27:00.444 --> 27:02.577
Oh, now you're checking
my mileage?

27:02.621 --> 27:05.058
You have a lover.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.537
I know it.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.278
Lord.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.889
We haven't made it to dessert,
and you're already blotto.

27:09.932 --> 27:14.589
I'll bet he's young and pretty
and, uh, for sale.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.895
Just like you were.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.505
I'm not listening to this.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.028
It must be tough...

27:19.072 --> 27:21.030
getting old.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.031
Hmm?

27:22.075 --> 27:23.729
Having to pay

27:23.772 --> 27:26.035
for what you used to sell.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.865
That's it.

27:29.909 --> 27:32.781
You pathetic son of a bitch.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.783
I'm cutting you off.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.438
No more whiskey.

27:38.395 --> 27:41.834
He'll turn out to be more
expensive than you ever were.

27:42.965 --> 27:47.013
Because when I catch you,
he'll cost you everything.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.797
Go ahead.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.670
Drink the whole bottle.
See if I care.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.238
[laughs]

28:06.685 --> 28:08.861
Nice try, Mendoza.

28:08.904 --> 28:11.298
But I want the money
and the dame.

28:13.169 --> 28:15.041
[more menacing]:
Nice try, Mendoza.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.913
But I want the money
andthe dame.

28:18.827 --> 28:21.482
[phone rings]

28:21.525 --> 28:23.179
[snoring]

28:23.223 --> 28:24.659
Hello?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.052
Scooter...

28:26.095 --> 28:28.141
there's been a change of plans.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.544
[machine jams]

28:40.588 --> 28:41.632
No.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.721
Oh, no.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.548
No, the needle.

28:44.592 --> 28:47.203
No. [grunts]

28:59.825 --> 29:01.174
Ow.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.745
What?

29:09.660 --> 29:11.227
[clatters]

29:25.154 --> 29:26.242
You're still up?

29:26.286 --> 29:28.331
It's almost 4:00.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.899
My dress isn't finished yet,
and the party's tomorrow.

29:30.943 --> 29:33.336
Um, I found this
up in the attic.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.773
Do you know where it came from?

29:34.816 --> 29:36.775
Maybe it was Grandma's.

29:36.818 --> 29:37.863
Did you ask Dad?

29:37.906 --> 29:39.168
He's asleep.

29:39.212 --> 29:42.737
The tag says
"February 14, 1945"

29:42.781 --> 29:45.784
and it's got the name
"Enid Dolan" written on it.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.263
-That's odd.
-Hmm.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.875
Well, it's in our attic.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.180
Guess it's yours now.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.834
[chuckles]

29:52.878 --> 29:55.489
-Good night.
-Good night.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.334
Hello, lover.

30:15.465 --> 30:16.771
Are you sure this is safe?

30:16.815 --> 30:17.859
Oh, relax.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.469
Carlo's upstairs, dead drunk.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.731
[giggles]

30:20.775 --> 30:22.559
It's just, these are nice digs.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.170
I'd hate to see you get evicted.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.739
[scoffs]

30:28.783 --> 30:31.133
What if we did get caught?

30:31.177 --> 30:34.223
Would I lose my appeal
if I didn't have Carlo's money?

30:35.485 --> 30:37.313
You think your only appeal
is your money?

30:37.357 --> 30:40.751
I thought a house this size
might have some mirrors in it.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.623
[chuckles]

30:42.666 --> 30:44.886
Oh, that was sweet. Thank you.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.888
To tell you the truth...

30:46.932 --> 30:47.976
[puts drink down]

30:48.020 --> 30:50.109
I'm not that thirsty.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.896
[meows]

30:54.940 --> 30:57.290
[purring]

30:58.465 --> 31:00.075
[Scooter and Rita moaning]

31:00.119 --> 31:01.642
[cat meows]

31:01.685 --> 31:03.731
[moaning continues]

31:07.735 --> 31:09.084
[Rita shouts]

31:14.655 --> 31:16.700
[moaning continues]

31:19.051 --> 31:21.444
[moaning]

31:23.403 --> 31:24.491
Rita?

31:24.534 --> 31:26.014
Oh.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.668
Carlo?

31:27.711 --> 31:28.669
Are you up?

31:28.712 --> 31:30.410
Who's down there?

31:30.453 --> 31:32.151
I hear a man.

31:32.194 --> 31:35.719
Shh. Um, it was just the radio.

31:35.763 --> 31:36.851
Go back to bed.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.722
I got you.

31:38.766 --> 31:41.377
I got you. Got you. Got you.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.901
[grunts]

31:48.167 --> 31:49.472
[gasps]

31:55.565 --> 31:57.611
[panting]

32:30.035 --> 32:33.386
Darling, we just heard
Carlo's in the hospital.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.996
What happened?

32:35.040 --> 32:37.172
Oh, he took a nasty fall
down the stairs last night

32:37.216 --> 32:39.392
-and had a stroke.
-[sighs]

32:39.435 --> 32:41.176
The doctors aren't sure
he'll make it.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.786
JOAN:
Oh, Rita,
you-you should go to him.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.310
We'll-we'll hold
the fort down here.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.964
The last thing
you want to do today

32:46.007 --> 32:47.487
is host a memorial for Vonda.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.271
No.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.971
This is now a tribute to Carlo.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.625
And the garden
he loved so very much.

32:55.669 --> 32:56.713
Excuse me.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.895
May I pour Madam
a glass of wine?

33:04.939 --> 33:06.636
Are you insane?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.073
My husband just had a stroke.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.335
He's at death's door.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.642
Put it in a teacup.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.395
Oh. [chuckles]

33:26.439 --> 33:28.006
Thank you.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.182
Very much.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.882
Mmm.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.016
Excuse me.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.019
Aah!

33:43.108 --> 33:44.152
Alma?

33:44.196 --> 33:46.024
Are you all right?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.677
Rita. Yes.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.027
I'm fine.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.507
I was just admiring
your flowers.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.814
They're, they're glorious.
[chuckles]

33:53.857 --> 33:55.511
Thanks.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.078
You have mulch in your bow.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.167
Oh.
[laughs]

34:00.560 --> 34:02.170
So I do. [laughs]

34:02.214 --> 34:04.868
Can't take me anywhere.
[chuckles]

34:04.912 --> 34:06.827
So...

34:06.870 --> 34:08.829
splendid party.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.439
Are you having fun?

34:10.483 --> 34:13.225
My husband had a stroke
last night.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.271
-He might not survive.
-Oh, dear.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.274
I started the day convinced
I would never laugh again.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.841
And then...

34:20.884 --> 34:24.410
you walked in,
wearing that frock. [chuckles]

34:25.715 --> 34:28.457
Oh, bless you, Alma.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.191
You're late.

35:06.234 --> 35:08.367
Sorry, Scooter.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.556
It's Alma, right?

35:23.599 --> 35:25.079
Yes. That's me.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.559
Alma Fillcot.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.517
Grace Burk.
I'm glad you could make it.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.649
Oh, me, too.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.130
Yeah, everything is just...

35:32.173 --> 35:33.870
lovely.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.524
Do I still have mulch in my bow?

35:35.568 --> 35:37.178
No, forgive me.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.832
I-I was just looking at
that cameo you're wearing.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.660
Oh. It's pretty, isn't it?

35:40.703 --> 35:42.618
Oh, my Aunt Enid
had one just like it.

35:44.968 --> 35:45.926
Enid?

35:45.969 --> 35:47.406
My mother's sister.

35:47.449 --> 35:50.670
She died, um,
four years ago now.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.193
On Valentine's Day.

35:53.194 --> 35:56.241
That's, um,
February 14, isn't it?

35:56.284 --> 35:59.244
I remember because I had gotten
her some candy.

35:59.287 --> 36:02.203
Then I walked into her home
and I found her,

36:02.247 --> 36:04.814
um, well, dead on the sofa.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.512
Oh.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.688
I'm, I'm very sorry.

36:11.473 --> 36:12.561
Oh, my good...
I don't believe it.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.128
Bet-Betsy is here.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.217
-Oh.
-[chuckling]: Excuse me, Alma.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.871
Betsy.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.885
A waiter said
you wanted to see me.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.756
The doctor from the hospital
is on the phone.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.497
He needs to talk to you.

36:36.542 --> 36:37.499
[clears throat]

36:37.543 --> 36:38.979
Hello, Doctor.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.676
This is Mrs. Castillo.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.112
Any news about my husband?

36:42.156 --> 36:43.505
We've done some tests.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.682
The stroke he suffered
was very serious.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.206
And...

36:48.249 --> 36:49.685
But he's a fighter.

36:49.729 --> 36:51.078
His vital signs
are getting stronger

36:51.121 --> 36:52.253
by the hour.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.950
Stronger?

36:53.994 --> 36:56.692
He may not regain his speech
or basic motor function.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.913
But with home nursing
and loving care from you,

36:59.956 --> 37:01.567
he could live another 20 years.

37:01.610 --> 37:05.092
[phone clicking]

37:05.135 --> 37:08.226
No! No! No! No! No!

37:09.618 --> 37:11.707
[sobbing]

37:14.057 --> 37:15.972
Excuse me, Mrs. Burk.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.061
-Oh.
-[chuckles] Sorry.

37:18.105 --> 37:20.238
Um, I wanted to give you this.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.196
Your cameo?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.937
-Don't be silly.
-No, I, I...

37:23.980 --> 37:26.026
I think it was your aunt's.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.332
Read the inscription.

37:31.553 --> 37:34.600
Oh. I, I don't understand.
H-How...?

37:34.643 --> 37:37.559
Oh, I, I, I bought it.

37:37.603 --> 37:40.127
Um, years ago,
at a rummage sale.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.303
At my church.

37:42.347 --> 37:46.089
And here I always thought one of
her nurses had sticky fingers.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.743
[both chuckle]

37:47.787 --> 37:50.224
W-Well, obviously I will
reimburse you.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.617
-Oh.
-What did you pay for it?

37:51.660 --> 37:53.271
Don't be silly.
It's a family heirloom.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.142
It was an honor to return it.

37:55.185 --> 37:56.535
Oh.

37:56.578 --> 37:57.884
It's-it's late. I have to go.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.015
So, excuse me.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.279
-It's nice to...
-[gasps]

38:03.237 --> 38:06.196
Was that
the veterinarian's wife?

38:06.240 --> 38:08.373
Her name is Alma.

38:08.416 --> 38:12.333
And she is just the sweetest
little thing. [chuckles]

38:14.204 --> 38:16.859
I wonder if she'd be interested
in joining our club.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.600
[chuckles]

38:19.514 --> 38:21.603
[both panting]

38:23.431 --> 38:25.085
That sure was nice.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.347
And then some.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
[phone rings]

38:28.393 --> 38:30.046
Go ahead.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.310
You don't want to keep
your rich girlfriend waiting.

38:32.353 --> 38:33.789
[phone rings]

38:33.833 --> 38:35.051
[both sigh]

38:36.052 --> 38:37.793
Hello.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.187
It's my agent.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.884
Uh-huh?

38:44.104 --> 38:45.584
Oh.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.847
Oh, no. That's all right, Max.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.589
Yeah, it wasn't much
of a part anyway.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.374
Mm-hmm.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.376
All right. Bye.

39:02.992 --> 39:05.125
The story about Lana Turner
getting discovered

39:05.168 --> 39:09.085
at Schwab's... it's a lie.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.914
Careers take time.
You just got to be patient.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.700
You really think I have a shot?

39:14.743 --> 39:16.528
Oh. With that kisser?

39:16.571 --> 39:18.747
Of course you do.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.145
I wish my rich lady friend
was nice like you.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.800
She pays your bills.

39:27.843 --> 39:29.802
She doesn't have to be nice.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.545
I feel really bad
making you dress like that.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.330
But if my lady friend
found out about us...

39:36.374 --> 39:37.679
It's okay, Scoot.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.289
I know the score.

39:40.247 --> 39:41.683
Who knows?

39:41.727 --> 39:44.294
Maybe I'll kick her
to the curb one day.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.426
-And then you and I will...
-Hey.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.515
