<i>Previously
on Another Period...</i>

00:02.406 --> 00:04.173
<i>Hamish learned
Chair was having an affair</i>

00:04.175 --> 00:06.241
<i>with the commodore
and decided to blackmail her.</i>

00:06.243 --> 00:07.676
<i>Lillian slept with Hamish,</i>

00:07.678 --> 00:09.311
<i>hoping she would get
some attention,</i>

00:09.313 --> 00:11.346
<i>but when all of
the Bellacourt family's secrets</i>

00:11.348 --> 00:14.116
<i>appeared in the newspaper
and a reporter wound up dead,</i>

00:14.118 --> 00:15.818
<i>Chair framed Hamish
for the murder.</i>

00:15.820 --> 00:17.419
<i>Confused?</i>

00:17.421 --> 00:20.569
<i>You won't be
after this episode of Another Period.</i>

00:21.892 --> 00:23.625
<i>Sounds like someone's got</i>

00:23.627 --> 00:25.227
a case of the Mondays.

00:25.229 --> 00:26.761
Oh, buddy,
do you really want to spend

00:26.763 --> 00:28.263
what could be
your last moments

00:28.265 --> 00:29.998
just pacing around in worry?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.100
You got to enjoy
the little things,

00:32.101 --> 00:33.902
like sunlight

00:33.904 --> 00:37.105
or sitting on the very bucket
you're pooping in.

00:37.107 --> 00:38.673
Hamish!

00:38.675 --> 00:40.342
You've got a visitor.

00:41.812 --> 00:45.046
Now, keep it
to deep kissing only.

00:45.048 --> 00:46.948
We're not lovers!

00:46.950 --> 00:48.683
He's my brother.

00:50.654 --> 00:54.222
Deep kissing only.

00:56.326 --> 00:57.959
What's the matter with you?

00:57.961 --> 00:59.828
You cannot tell anybody
that we're brothers.

00:59.830 --> 01:02.697
I don't care about keeping
your little secrets anymore.

01:02.699 --> 01:05.033
I die at sunset.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.341
I'm scared too.

01:13.343 --> 01:16.778
Remember when we were younger,
we used to play that game?

01:16.780 --> 01:20.348
Lighting Daddy's warehouse
on fire for insurance money?

01:20.350 --> 01:22.350
No, not Jewish Lightning,
dummy.

01:22.352 --> 01:23.385
The other game,

01:23.387 --> 01:25.453
the vaginal description game.

01:25.455 --> 01:26.688
Oh.

01:26.690 --> 01:28.123
He never made it
past first grade,

01:28.125 --> 01:30.158
but, my God, there was
no one better

01:30.160 --> 01:31.993
at guessing what
a woman's crinkle looked like

01:31.995 --> 01:33.495
than old Hamish.

01:33.497 --> 01:35.130
Oh, that sounds like
a hell of a time.

01:35.132 --> 01:37.899
Do one now.
Do Mary Todd Lincoln.

01:37.901 --> 01:40.068
Oh, I don't want to.
Not in the mood.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.736
Lost your touch, eh?

01:41.738 --> 01:44.706
Yeah, right.

01:44.708 --> 01:46.875
Powerful first impression.

01:46.877 --> 01:48.476
Old man frowny face.

01:48.478 --> 01:50.679
Smells of freedom,
which...

01:50.681 --> 01:51.913
smells like onions.

01:51.915 --> 01:54.049
That is exactly right.
I know.

01:54.051 --> 01:55.817
I paid for a glimpse
at the state fair.

01:55.819 --> 01:58.620
I have a gift.
<i>Had</i> a gift.

02:00.357 --> 02:01.990
Hold tight, Hamish.

02:01.992 --> 02:04.859
I'm going to get you freed.

02:04.861 --> 02:06.394
Guard?

02:06.396 --> 02:08.029
While you're at it,
is there any chance

02:08.031 --> 02:09.663
of you getting me freed too?

02:09.666 --> 02:10.999
We'll see.

02:11.001 --> 02:12.834
He-- he said it
like a yes.

02:12.836 --> 02:14.269
It was a no.

02:14.271 --> 02:16.605
I mean, you just got
a bad attitude.

02:16.607 --> 02:18.873
No, I know him.
He's a terrible person.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.192
Ah!

02:37.194 --> 02:38.960
Beatrice,
what are you doing?

02:38.962 --> 02:41.563
Well, I can't go to trial
without doing cocaine.

02:41.565 --> 02:43.632
Well, why are you shooting it
into your eyeballs?

02:43.634 --> 02:45.600
'Cause it'll get
to my brain faster.

02:45.602 --> 02:48.703
Flobelle, do my hair
into maize rows.

02:48.705 --> 02:50.739
I, uh, don't do hair, my lady.

02:50.741 --> 02:54.109
Oh, I guess I'll never stop
being surprised around here.

02:54.111 --> 02:56.077
Miss Lillian, I do hair.

02:56.079 --> 02:58.546
Do you think I'd trust
some pussy fanner

02:58.548 --> 03:00.548
to touch my head
on a day like today?

03:00.550 --> 03:03.218
Get back down there
and fan my pussy!

03:03.220 --> 03:05.587
I want it bone dry
for the trial.

03:06.923 --> 03:08.757
Technically, Hamish is
the one being tried,

03:08.759 --> 03:10.258
but I've been called to testify

03:10.260 --> 03:12.260
due to the fact
that I'm his former lover.

03:12.262 --> 03:14.562
And also I'm beautiful,
charismatic,

03:14.564 --> 03:15.764
sexually intoxicating--

03:15.766 --> 03:17.465
I just want to see
someone die--

03:17.467 --> 03:20.969
from hanging or firing squad
or dynamite or...

03:20.971 --> 03:21.970
even old age.

03:21.972 --> 03:23.438
Yes.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.639
Well, who doesn't?

03:24.641 --> 03:25.974
But let's not try
to shift focus

03:25.976 --> 03:28.276
off of the person
who matters here-- me.

03:28.278 --> 03:29.577
Oh, give me the P.

03:29.579 --> 03:31.746
But I wanted to wear
Mr. Plume.

03:31.748 --> 03:33.648
Beatrice, I can't have you
upstaging me.

03:33.650 --> 03:35.016
If you want more attention,

03:35.018 --> 03:36.885
you should start sleeping
with more murderers.

03:36.887 --> 03:37.986
Fine.

03:37.988 --> 03:40.622
Oh, great.
Cripple mom is here.

03:41.758 --> 03:42.991
Lillian, why are you dressed

03:42.993 --> 03:45.694
like a Prussian whore
on payday?

03:45.696 --> 03:48.096
Lillian's wearing Mr. P
because she's the star witness

03:48.098 --> 03:49.297
and I'm not.

03:49.299 --> 03:51.299
Just as I coached you,
Beatrice.

03:51.301 --> 03:53.001
Well, I don't have
to coach anyone

03:53.003 --> 03:55.170
to convince myself
I'm important.

03:55.172 --> 03:57.272
It is my testimony
that will determine

03:57.274 --> 03:59.140
whether Hamish lives or--

03:59.142 --> 04:00.442
Dies!

04:00.444 --> 04:01.676
Dies.

04:01.678 --> 04:03.244
Or dies.

04:04.781 --> 04:07.215
See you in court, Chair.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.386
Oh.
Ah!

04:11.388 --> 04:12.987
Help her with her drugs.

04:23.066 --> 04:25.033
Don't you see?

04:25.035 --> 04:26.167
Hamish is innocent.

04:26.169 --> 04:27.736
I killed that reporter,

04:27.738 --> 04:29.804
and now Hamish stands
to be executed

04:29.806 --> 04:33.675
for what I did,
for my sin.

04:33.677 --> 04:36.177
Guide me, o willow.

04:36.179 --> 04:38.012
Yes.

04:38.014 --> 04:39.814
Yes, of course.
You're right.

04:39.816 --> 04:42.150
O willow, I must confess.

04:42.152 --> 04:43.752
Yes, they will kill me,

04:43.754 --> 04:46.187
but I must be willing
to face that.

04:46.189 --> 04:48.356
And this, this being
my last day,

04:48.358 --> 04:50.725
I shall live
as I never have before.

04:50.727 --> 04:53.595
Anyhoo, enough about me.
How are you?

04:53.597 --> 04:56.431
How are Fern and the kids?

04:57.567 --> 04:58.733
One more photo, ladies.

04:58.735 --> 05:00.168
One more.

05:00.170 --> 05:02.003
Oh, my.

05:02.005 --> 05:05.039
If it isn't Brussels Sheridan
from "The Looky-Loo."

05:05.041 --> 05:06.841
Look, a woman smoking in public.

05:06.843 --> 05:09.177
Real taboo stuff happening here.

05:09.179 --> 05:12.847
Is that supposed to be some
kind of political statement?

05:12.849 --> 05:14.916
Yes, you might want to write
a little article about it.

05:14.918 --> 05:16.851
And since you've asked,
as survivor

05:16.853 --> 05:19.287
of a sexual encounter
with a poor person, I--

05:19.289 --> 05:20.722
If this trial continues,

05:20.724 --> 05:23.291
I will bathe myself
in the blood of 12 pigs.

05:23.293 --> 05:26.428
And I will eat those 12 pigs,

05:26.430 --> 05:28.897
rub their guts on my body,

05:28.899 --> 05:31.232
and set myself on fire

05:31.234 --> 05:34.602
if Hamish is not freed
by sundown

05:34.604 --> 05:36.905
to be my star lover.

05:36.907 --> 05:39.307
I was in the middle
of a speech, gals.

05:39.309 --> 05:42.076
I realize you're all having
a psychic love affair--

05:42.078 --> 05:43.378
Girls, over here.
Over here.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.579
What about me?

05:44.581 --> 05:46.080
Get out of the photo!

05:46.082 --> 05:47.649
They're my backup dancers.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.285
There are so many
desperate things happening here,

05:50.287 --> 05:52.754
it's hard to decide
which is the worst.

05:52.756 --> 05:54.789
Oh!
Oh.

05:59.429 --> 06:02.597
Judge Henson,
it's very... embarrassing

06:02.599 --> 06:05.733
that my employee is on trial
for murder,

06:05.735 --> 06:08.002
so the quicker this goes away,
the better.

06:08.004 --> 06:13.174
I have another idea
how justice can prevail.

06:14.845 --> 06:16.978
According to Rhode Island
state law,

06:16.980 --> 06:19.481
should no judge be present
and qualified to try a case,

06:19.483 --> 06:21.749
any sworn federal officer
may step in

06:21.751 --> 06:24.152
and act as judge.

06:24.154 --> 06:25.253
Ah!

06:25.255 --> 06:27.455
Oh, Papa, I love my new dress.

06:27.457 --> 06:30.091
Son, remember
what we discussed.

06:30.093 --> 06:31.259
Mm-hmm.

06:31.261 --> 06:32.727
Well, with all due respect,
Father,

06:32.729 --> 06:34.429
I am the selected official,

06:34.431 --> 06:38.099
and I will do
whatever you say.

06:38.101 --> 06:40.969
Which is to declare a...

06:40.971 --> 06:42.136
Dogfight.

06:42.138 --> 06:44.672
- No, mistrial.
- Yes, mistrial!

06:44.674 --> 06:47.642
Ooh, I love the feeling
of this law hammer.

06:47.644 --> 06:48.676
What's it called?

06:49.980 --> 06:51.479
Who cares?
I'm king of the lawyers.

06:51.481 --> 06:53.715
Bye, Father.

06:59.956 --> 07:02.490
Well, if it isn't
my betrayer.

07:02.492 --> 07:04.192
What do you want?

07:04.194 --> 07:07.762
I'm just here to do to you
what you did to me.

07:09.533 --> 07:11.466
Oh.

07:11.468 --> 07:12.901
I'm gonna tell them about

07:12.903 --> 07:15.570
all the bad things
you did to me

07:15.572 --> 07:19.741
and what a sad, sad girl
that made me.

07:20.777 --> 07:22.577
And while I'm doing that,

07:22.579 --> 07:26.014
I want you think about
all the reasons

07:26.016 --> 07:28.883
why you shouldn't have
blackmailed me.

07:28.885 --> 07:30.985
Oh, well, at least I'll die

07:30.987 --> 07:32.921
being cranked by the best
in the biz.

07:32.923 --> 07:36.724
Oh, ain't nothing crippled
about that hand, is there?

07:36.726 --> 07:38.860
Oh.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.395
Enjoy your blue balls.

07:40.397 --> 07:41.629
No, no, no, no.

07:41.631 --> 07:43.398
I hear they compliment
a broken neck.

07:44.668 --> 07:46.100
No! Get back here!

07:46.102 --> 07:48.336
Oh, come on!
Oh, come on!

07:48.338 --> 07:49.437
I need a release!

07:49.439 --> 07:51.573
Oh, God, please,

07:51.575 --> 07:53.541
if you can just
grant me anything,

07:53.543 --> 07:55.677
help release me!

07:55.679 --> 07:59.147
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

08:01.017 --> 08:03.651
Wow. Thanks, God.

08:16.173 --> 08:17.639
All rise.

08:20.177 --> 08:23.011
Now sit down...
if you're a sexual deviant.

08:23.013 --> 08:26.248
Oh!

Excuse me, sir.

08:41.532 --> 08:43.365
Charleton Wimbledon
representing the state.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.701
Objection!
Relevance?

08:45.703 --> 08:49.605
You're simply repeating
legal terms you've heard before.

08:49.607 --> 08:50.973
Is that correct?

08:50.975 --> 08:52.307
Overruled!

08:52.309 --> 08:53.742
Yeah, that's what
it sounded like.

08:53.744 --> 08:56.778
Mark Twain here.

08:56.780 --> 08:59.081
America's premier storyteller

08:59.083 --> 09:01.717
stepping up to the bar
for the defense.

09:01.719 --> 09:05.721
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury--

09:05.723 --> 09:07.656
Sorry.
My mistake.

09:07.658 --> 09:10.626
Women aren't allowed to serve
on juries.

09:11.729 --> 09:16.098
My client may be a bad man.

09:16.100 --> 09:20.035
Hell, he may have even killed
Scoops LePue!

09:22.740 --> 09:24.406
The state rests.

09:24.408 --> 09:26.108
Uh, you're not--
you're not the state.

09:26.110 --> 09:27.776
I'm the state.

09:27.778 --> 09:29.678
And you don't rest
until the end of the trial.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.812
Wanna bet?

09:30.814 --> 09:32.414
It's very disappointing.

09:32.416 --> 09:34.082
- Not a great lawyer.
- No.

09:34.084 --> 09:35.450
No.

09:35.452 --> 09:37.185
It does me no great honor
to tell you

09:37.187 --> 09:41.089
<i>I indulged myself
for the first and last time.</i>

09:41.091 --> 09:44.593
One, uh, rahvay-olay.

09:44.595 --> 09:45.861
Ravioli?

09:45.863 --> 09:47.462
- Huh?
- Ravioli.

09:47.464 --> 09:50.332
Yes, uh, medium rare, please.

09:50.334 --> 09:51.800
Prego.

09:51.802 --> 09:52.935
Thank you.

09:52.937 --> 09:54.703
I'm eating in a restaurant.

09:56.740 --> 09:59.141
Your Honor,
I think it may be time

09:59.143 --> 10:00.809
for me to call my first witness.

10:02.546 --> 10:05.314
'Twas a cold October morning.

10:05.316 --> 10:07.182
The pumpkins were ripe then

10:07.184 --> 10:10.185
and pregnant with possibility,

10:10.187 --> 10:11.620
like my pregnant friend Carla.

10:11.622 --> 10:13.155
Poor Carla.

10:13.157 --> 10:16.625
Autumn had sprinkled itself
throughout the land.

10:16.627 --> 10:18.327
It's really not her turn
to speak.

10:18.329 --> 10:21.563
Order! It is not your turn
to speak, Lillian.

10:21.565 --> 10:22.998
Thank you.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.399
The state calls--

10:24.401 --> 10:25.701
Oh.

10:25.703 --> 10:27.402
Lillian Bellacourt.

10:31.175 --> 10:34.409
Now, you've said that you
and the defendant were lovers.

10:34.411 --> 10:36.378
Can a woman
who has laid with a man

10:36.380 --> 10:37.980
who has trouble
getting an erection

10:37.982 --> 10:39.848
truly be called
that man's lover?

10:39.850 --> 10:42.818
That's not really what we're
here to determine tod--

10:42.820 --> 10:44.052
I am the victim here.

10:44.054 --> 10:46.021
- Traitor!
- Curse you!

10:46.023 --> 10:51.093
You may have had his body,
but we will have his soul!

10:51.095 --> 10:52.861
Your jealousy
doesn't bother me.

10:52.863 --> 10:54.529
I own what you crave!

10:54.531 --> 10:56.231
Oh, fuck you!

10:56.233 --> 10:57.766
- You're okay with all that?
- Order!

10:57.768 --> 10:59.334
They're not really with me.

10:59.336 --> 11:00.469
- Bitch!
- Order!

11:00.471 --> 11:02.471
That bitch!

11:02.473 --> 11:06.408
If it please the court,
I have to go number one.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.610
Beatrice, would you take over
for me, please?

11:08.612 --> 11:10.012
- Take over?
- Me?

11:10.014 --> 11:11.113
- Yes.
- Oh!

11:11.115 --> 11:12.681
You can't just have someone--

11:12.683 --> 11:14.182
I've never done anything
like this before.

11:14.184 --> 11:15.951
That's not--
that's a problem.

11:15.953 --> 11:17.586
You can't just have anybody
come up and be the judge.

11:17.588 --> 11:18.787
- What are you doing?
- Here I go!

11:18.789 --> 11:20.922
I don't know.

11:20.924 --> 11:22.224
Execute him.

11:22.226 --> 11:24.426
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:24.428 --> 11:25.994
We're not there.
We need to have a trial.

11:25.996 --> 11:27.229
Well, sorry.
I'm not perfect.

11:27.231 --> 11:28.530
This is my first time.

11:28.532 --> 11:29.865
This is not even
your first time,

11:29.867 --> 11:31.199
because you're not a judge.

11:31.201 --> 11:32.968
You're really hurting
my feelings.

11:32.970 --> 11:34.803
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

11:34.805 --> 11:35.871
You're forgiven.

11:35.873 --> 11:37.706
Lillian, you may continue.

11:37.708 --> 11:40.075
I don't know
what I was talking about.

11:41.945 --> 11:43.912
Uno raviolo.

11:43.914 --> 11:45.180
Ah, thank you.

11:48.085 --> 11:49.751
Yes, please.

11:55.492 --> 11:57.325
More.

11:59.296 --> 12:01.063
Yes.

12:01.065 --> 12:04.266
Yes. Yes.

12:04.268 --> 12:06.234
Yes.

12:06.236 --> 12:09.271
Yes. Yes.

12:09.273 --> 12:11.073
While I understand your point,

12:11.075 --> 12:14.142
I feel like murder should
maybe be malum prohibitum

12:14.144 --> 12:15.911
instead of malum se.

12:15.913 --> 12:19.081
I don't think it's internally
naturally an evil thing.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.584
Sometimes murder is justified,
and maybe in Hamish's case,

12:22.586 --> 12:23.752
even though we know...

12:23.754 --> 12:26.121
- Beatrice?
- Oh, yes.

12:26.123 --> 12:28.657
What were all those
fancy words?

12:28.659 --> 12:29.825
What?

12:29.827 --> 12:32.094
Execute him.
Bye.

12:32.096 --> 12:33.628
No, that was--
that was interesting.

12:33.630 --> 12:35.464
That was good.
What she was saying was helpful.

12:35.466 --> 12:36.798
Order, order, order.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.633
Okay, everyone, I have
a little announcement.

12:38.635 --> 12:39.935
It was only number one,

12:39.937 --> 12:41.603
but I did it sitting down
just in case.

12:41.605 --> 12:45.807
Anyway, I am back from my break.

12:45.809 --> 12:47.509
Oh, just in time
for another break.

12:47.511 --> 12:49.444
If anyone needs me,
I will be in my chamber,

12:49.446 --> 12:51.613
playing a solo game
of Duck, Duck, Goose.

13:03.961 --> 13:05.026
Aye, missy!

13:05.028 --> 13:06.294
What are you doing up there?

13:06.296 --> 13:08.530
Who, me? Nothing.

13:08.532 --> 13:10.365
Darling, this ain't
a maypole

13:10.367 --> 13:12.134
for you to be dancing around.

13:12.136 --> 13:14.536
This is a death machine.

13:14.538 --> 13:16.538
I just like it
when people go poof

13:16.540 --> 13:18.640
and then they aren't there
anymore.

13:18.642 --> 13:20.008
Oh.

13:20.010 --> 13:22.210
Well, you'd make
a good police officer,

13:22.212 --> 13:23.245
wouldn't you?

13:24.414 --> 13:26.548
You want to try it on
for size?

13:26.550 --> 13:27.883
Mm-hmm.

13:27.885 --> 13:30.886
Okay, well, you take
the wonton criminal,

13:30.888 --> 13:33.522
and you put him up here
like so.

13:33.524 --> 13:38.493
And then you take the noose,
and you slip it over his head,

13:38.495 --> 13:42.164
making sure to make it
nice and tight.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.534
And then you hang him until
his eyes pop out of his head

13:45.536 --> 13:48.670
like cherry tomatoes
in a day-old salad.

13:48.672 --> 13:50.105
Tighter.

13:50.107 --> 13:53.742
You know, it gets lonely
down at the precinct.

13:53.744 --> 13:55.477
Tighter.

13:55.479 --> 13:59.014
All right, even this
is even weird for me.

14:01.451 --> 14:03.351
- You okay?
- Uh-uh.

14:03.353 --> 14:05.086
- Kelly, what are you doing?
- Oy!

14:05.088 --> 14:09.791
You know you're not supposed
to have women out here...

14:09.793 --> 14:11.426
without me.

14:12.462 --> 14:13.461
Yeah, that's right.

14:13.463 --> 14:15.096
Right, bring her in.

14:15.098 --> 14:17.632
Ah, here you go,
you wee sunflower, you.

14:17.634 --> 14:21.269
Yeah, give her
a nice kiss there.

14:21.271 --> 14:23.138
Kelly, she's dead!

14:23.140 --> 14:24.573
She's dead!
Bring her back!

14:24.575 --> 14:25.740
- Bring her back.
- Oh, no.

14:25.742 --> 14:27.075
- My goodness!
- Oh, boy.

14:27.077 --> 14:29.110
Oh, I can't do this!
Oh, my God! Okay!

14:29.112 --> 14:30.178
We--

14:32.097 --> 14:34.730
I didn't know what to do.

14:34.732 --> 14:36.265
He came out Scoop's office
with murder in his eyes.

14:36.267 --> 14:39.234
He held a knife up
to my pregnant belly

14:39.236 --> 14:41.837
and said, "Woman,
if you tell a soul,

14:41.839 --> 14:45.307
I will cut your unborn baby
out of you

14:45.309 --> 14:47.876
and hang it
from the clock tower!"

14:49.180 --> 14:50.579
You monster.

14:50.581 --> 14:53.482
- He loves abortion.
- No!

14:53.484 --> 14:55.751
He's always aborting this
and aborting that.

14:55.753 --> 14:58.954
Anyway, I told him
to leave me alone

14:58.956 --> 15:00.089
and I would never tell a soul.

15:00.091 --> 15:02.658
But that poor man.

15:02.660 --> 15:07.262
That poor Scoops LePue.

15:07.264 --> 15:10.432
Your Honor, I know
this is unorthodox,

15:10.434 --> 15:14.636
but I would like the opportunity
to testify against my client.

15:14.638 --> 15:16.405
What?

15:16.407 --> 15:19.274
You've cost me
my entire savings,

15:19.276 --> 15:21.844
but you were worth it, ravioli.

15:21.846 --> 15:24.813
What wonderful surprises await
every bite

15:24.815 --> 15:27.282
of your mystery innards.

15:27.284 --> 15:28.784
Mmm!

15:28.786 --> 15:29.885
Waiter!

15:29.887 --> 15:31.820
More Chianti.

15:31.822 --> 15:33.288
Will there be
anything else?

15:33.290 --> 15:34.857
We are about to close.

15:34.859 --> 15:37.025
How long have I been here?

15:37.027 --> 15:39.795
Signore, you have been
slicing that ravioli

15:39.797 --> 15:40.963
for almost three hours.

15:40.965 --> 15:42.397
Oh, my goodness.
The trial.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.134
Thank you, Giuseppe.
Arrivederci.

15:45.136 --> 15:46.568
Arrivederci.
Grazie.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.304
Mr. Peepers, go!
Italia is behind you.

15:49.306 --> 15:51.440
Mr. Crassus, would you say

15:51.442 --> 15:54.276
that you're an angry person?

15:54.278 --> 15:56.211
No, I would say

15:56.213 --> 16:00.249
that I'm a very calm
and happy man.

16:00.251 --> 16:04.686
What if I were to call you
a filthy, stupid, bearded idiot?

16:04.688 --> 16:06.388
You take that back,
you pile of shit!

16:06.390 --> 16:08.590
I'll kill you while
your whole family watches,

16:08.592 --> 16:09.758
and then I'll kill them!

16:09.760 --> 16:11.260
I've killed men for less!

16:11.262 --> 16:13.028
Murder's my favorite!

16:13.030 --> 16:15.164
Oh! Oh!

16:15.166 --> 16:16.665
Damn it!

16:16.667 --> 16:18.834
I have no further questions.

16:18.836 --> 16:20.502
It's a joke.

16:20.504 --> 16:22.905
Well, I'm ready to render
my "guilty" verdict.

16:24.508 --> 16:26.575
Hamish is innocent!

16:26.577 --> 16:28.744
He has an alibi!
He can prove it!

16:30.014 --> 16:31.446
He's just protecting the woman

16:31.448 --> 16:32.848
he's been having an affair with.

16:32.850 --> 16:34.950
- Is it you?
- I don't know.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.052
- Her!
- What?

16:37.054 --> 16:40.556
Martha, the--
the pig butcher's wife?

16:40.558 --> 16:41.890
I don't know that woman.

16:41.892 --> 16:44.860
Enough of this
martyrdom, son!

16:44.862 --> 16:46.929
Your life is on the line!

16:46.931 --> 16:50.465
Just before the trial,
he was telling me

16:50.467 --> 16:52.434
what her...

16:52.436 --> 16:54.503
feminine parts looked like.

16:54.505 --> 16:56.305
Isn't that right?

16:57.575 --> 16:59.441
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

16:59.443 --> 17:01.410
Jeez, I, uh-- yes.

17:01.412 --> 17:03.912
I didn't want to say anything,
but...

17:03.914 --> 17:06.181
we are having an affair.

17:06.183 --> 17:07.883
That's not true.

17:07.885 --> 17:09.984
I know just what
her scrunchy looks like.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.890
It's dark, and--
and puffy, yes.

17:14.892 --> 17:16.290
- Puffy?
- Very puffy.

17:16.292 --> 17:19.428
And-- and thinly lipped,

17:19.430 --> 17:21.696
like-- like carpaccio.

17:21.699 --> 17:23.598
Yeah, yeah.

17:23.601 --> 17:28.637
It kind of resembles
the coastline of New Hampshire.

17:28.639 --> 17:30.439
Well, is that true?

17:30.441 --> 17:32.407
Is that what your vagina
looks like?

17:32.409 --> 17:34.810
Well, I don't know
what my vagina looks like.

17:34.812 --> 17:36.411
I've never seen it.

17:36.413 --> 17:37.579
Oh!

17:37.581 --> 17:39.414
I've seen a pig's vagina.

17:39.416 --> 17:41.483
That's because we butcher pigs.

17:41.485 --> 17:45.254
And I've seen a dog's vagina
before...

17:45.256 --> 17:47.689
Just on the street.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.392
Well, there's only one way
to solve this mystery.

17:50.394 --> 17:51.660
Show us.

17:51.662 --> 17:53.028
I'll show mine.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.429
It's tight
and smells of chutney.

17:54.431 --> 17:55.931
Lillian, have some dignity.

17:55.933 --> 17:57.599
This is a court of law.

17:58.669 --> 17:59.968
Ma'am, please stand up

17:59.970 --> 18:02.070
and show everyone your vagina.

18:04.808 --> 18:07.776
If it pleases the court.

18:07.778 --> 18:09.645
That remains to be seen.

18:27.531 --> 18:31.667
I give you the coastline
of New Hampshire!

18:34.004 --> 18:35.837
New Hampshire!

18:35.839 --> 18:38.707
Seems our problem
has been solved.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.742
What?
No! No, no, no.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.244
You can't decide a trial

18:42.246 --> 18:44.146
based on the shape
of a woman's vagina.

18:44.148 --> 18:45.380
That's not an alibi.

18:45.382 --> 18:47.182
What is the matter
with you people?

18:47.184 --> 18:48.684
The man is guilty!

18:48.686 --> 18:51.186
This man is innocent!

18:51.188 --> 18:53.588
I killed Scoops LePue.

18:57.728 --> 18:59.795
I killed Scoops LePue!

18:59.797 --> 19:01.430
No, no, I mean it.
I really did.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.731
I-- I killed him.

19:02.733 --> 19:04.666
I killed Scoops LePue.

19:04.668 --> 19:06.101
Order!

19:06.103 --> 19:08.170
And then I got his blood
on my face.

19:08.172 --> 19:09.438
I killed Scoops LePue.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.740
- I killed Scoops LePue!
- Order!

19:11.742 --> 19:13.842
I killed Poops LeScue!

19:13.844 --> 19:15.477
I would have killed
Scoops LePue.

19:15.479 --> 19:17.079
I was happy when he died.

19:18.916 --> 19:21.216
I killed Scoops LePue.

19:21.218 --> 19:23.752
What?

19:23.754 --> 19:25.887
Oh, you did?

19:25.889 --> 19:27.055
Yeah, that works for me.

19:27.057 --> 19:28.156
Yeah, me too.

19:28.158 --> 19:29.725
I guess I didn't kill him.

19:29.727 --> 19:31.393
- Off we go. Come on.
- Okay, here we go.

19:31.395 --> 19:33.061
No, I just got caught up
in the moment.

19:33.063 --> 19:34.730
I thought this was a thing
we were all doing.

19:34.732 --> 19:36.331
Sorry, you're coming
with us.

19:38.202 --> 19:40.135
I'm free!
Ha ha!

19:40.137 --> 19:42.904
I'm free!

19:42.906 --> 19:45.095
_

19:45.484 --> 19:47.617
Well, today was
a complete waste.

19:47.619 --> 19:49.286
Everyone ended up in the paper
except me.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.754
"Hamish Crassus Not Guilty."

19:50.756 --> 19:52.622
"Blonde Becomes the First Woman
to Hold Gavel."

19:52.624 --> 19:54.991
"Vagina Shaped
Just Like New Hampshire."

19:54.993 --> 19:58.428
I mean, who the hell knows what
New Hampshire's shaped like?

20:14.112 --> 20:15.411
No!

20:32.530 --> 20:34.130
Will you eat with us?

20:35.233 --> 20:37.200
No, thanks.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.402
I have somewhere to be.

20:47.699 --> 20:49.753
Welcome home, Hamish.

20:49.754 --> 20:52.009
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.853
Did I tell you guys
that I learnt to read?

20:55.422 --> 20:58.979
I did, I did.
I learnt.
