WEBVTT

01:03.890 --> 01:06.450
I'm not doing this one.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.456
Oh, but they're
not allowed to sleep.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.594
How do you know
he's sleeping?

01:11.630 --> 01:14.269
Fine. I'll check.

01:19.710 --> 01:23.339
Sir, you can't sleep here.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.320
Can you call 911?

01:41.360 --> 01:42.827
Why?

01:42.870 --> 01:43.859
'Cause I'm gonna
have a heart attack

01:43.900 --> 01:44.867
trying to keep up with you.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.561
Ah! Scott?!

01:49.210 --> 01:50.859
Yeah.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.502
Carrie. Wells.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.428
We went on a blind date.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.799
June 11.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.740
It was a Saturday night;
two years ago.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.169
Sure. I remember. Yeah.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.642
Yeah, well,
I definitely remember.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.580
You had just finished
reading The Game.

02:03.620 --> 02:04.689
Over the course of
the night,

02:04.720 --> 02:05.789
you managed to
insult my hair

02:05.820 --> 02:06.752
hit on the waitress,

02:06.790 --> 02:07.916
and then you did
a magic trick

02:07.960 --> 02:09.780
where you set
my napkin on fire.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.320
Waitress a blonde?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.452
Brunette.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.353
Jenny from Schenectady.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.254
She had a crow tattoo
on her ring finger.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.459
Not ringing any bells, huh?

02:18.500 --> 02:20.536
I'm the one who pretended
to go to the bathroom

02:20.570 --> 02:21.537
and never came back.

02:22.940 --> 02:23.907
Right!

02:23.940 --> 02:25.464
Right!

02:25.510 --> 02:27.808
All right.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.341
Hello.

02:29.380 --> 02:30.574
It was nice
catching up with you.

02:30.610 --> 02:33.170
Oh, no one.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.278
Definitely.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.140
I am on my way.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.455
EMTs were alarmed enough.

02:41.490 --> 02:44.323
They sent the librarians
and other patrons to the ER.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.920
Well, if this is Ebola
or any other virus,

02:46.960 --> 02:48.496
and this guy came in contact

02:48.530 --> 02:49.895
with other people on
the way over here,

02:49.930 --> 02:52.660
then we are in big trouble.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.792
Not a bad place to end up.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.703
Better than the hospital
he escaped from.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.446
A lot of viruses in hospitals.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.845
Could he have caught
what killed him there?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.677
Ah, it's possible.

03:23.030 --> 03:26.864
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's okay.
He's not contagious.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.368
Well, the good news is
a virus didn't kill him.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.902
So is there bad news?

03:31.940 --> 03:33.498
'Cause normally
I want that first.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.633
See this? Turns blue

03:35.680 --> 03:37.807
in the presence of nitroamines.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.614
Our buddy here
was poisoned by RDX,

03:40.650 --> 03:43.642
which is a primary component
of C-4 explosive.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.681
He was building a bomb.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.007
John Patton.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.871
Admitted to Columbia
Presbyterian

04:10.910 --> 04:13.674
suffering from
seizures and lethargy.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.449
They put him in triage.
He took off

04:15.480 --> 04:16.879
when no one was looking.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.617
The petechial rash
hadn't presented itself yet.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.878
And it is similar
to Ebola, so the EMTs

04:22.930 --> 04:23.885
were right to be concerned.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.626
But when I saw the RDX
under his nails, I knew.

04:26.660 --> 04:28.753
Would such a small amount
kill him?
No, he would

04:28.800 --> 04:31.064
_ have to be involved _
With a much larger concentration

04:31.100 --> 04:32.897
over a prolonged period.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.898
So you're saying he was making
a lot of C-4 for a long time.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.363
At least a week. Probably more.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.901
That's a little outside
your area of expertise, Joanne,

04:40.940 --> 04:41.975
don't you think?

04:42.010 --> 04:43.705
Eliot, how did you
get in here?

04:43.750 --> 04:45.877
They usually make people
who are not cold dead stiffs

04:45.910 --> 04:48.617
wait in the... reception.
That's how.

04:48.650 --> 04:51.619
Aw, you've been rehearsing that,
haven't you?

04:51.650 --> 04:52.719
Jo's pretty sure

04:52.760 --> 04:54.978
our victim was using
a lot of C-4.

04:55.020 --> 04:57.580
About that, until we get
further confirmation,

04:57.630 --> 05:00.690
I'd rather not go too wide
with that theory.

05:00.730 --> 05:02.789
You want me to cover up
my findings.

05:02.830 --> 05:05.993
No, but I have answered about
60 phone calls this morning

05:06.030 --> 05:09.067
about the Ebola attack on
the public library that wasn't.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.534
So before we go announcing
a bomb-making scare,

05:11.570 --> 05:13.106
I'd like a little more proof.

05:13.140 --> 05:16.803
Eliot, C-4's only used
for one thing: to blow stuff up.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.410
Yeah, look, maybe this guy's
digging himself a swimming pool

05:19.450 --> 05:21.668
or taking a tree out
of his baclqard.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.915
Oh, please.
All I'm saying
is, for now,

05:23.950 --> 05:26.680
I'd like to keep this in-house.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.086
I get it. We go wide
with "bomb-maker" now,

05:29.120 --> 05:30.929
we've got to bring
in Homeland Security,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.928
they take it off our plate.
And I like things

05:32.960 --> 05:35.428
on my plate.
I imagine you guys

05:35.460 --> 05:37.621
do, too, so... keep going.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.638
Let's see what this guy
was trying to blow up.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.694
And when we need help,

05:40.740 --> 05:42.435
we'll ask for it.

05:42.470 --> 05:45.530
Joanne, I love what
you've done with the place.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.970
All hard surfaces
and sharp pointy things

05:48.010 --> 05:51.446
for cutting people--
it's... so you.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.640
AL:
One day you got to

05:52.680 --> 05:54.443
tell me what happened
with you two.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.448
It'll take
a lot longer than a day.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.720
MAN:
It's awful about John, but I'm
glad there's no bomb, you know?

06:04.760 --> 06:07.593
Kind of thing
wreaks havoc on rents.
Yeah, I'm sure.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.860
And these boys
seemed so nice.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.630
But, uh, I guess everybody
says that. I mean, you always

06:12.670 --> 06:14.433
hear it on_ the news _when
they InterVIew the neighbors

06:14.470 --> 06:15.937
and whatnot.
So John had a roommate?

06:15.970 --> 06:17.403
Yeah, Harold Estes.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.930
Haven't seen him
in a few days though.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.733
AL:
Murray, I think
I got something.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.879
Mountain climber?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.911
Maybe.
Mm.

06:33.220 --> 06:35.188
Well, he wasn't climbing
mountains with this gear.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.885
Any of this stuff got RDX on it?

06:38.930 --> 06:40.921
Bomb squad cleared it.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.160
AL:
What do you got?

06:47.200 --> 06:49.634
Tickets from
the Transit Authority.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.002
For trespassing.
Both John and Harold.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.905
Seems our boys had
an interesting hobby:

06:53.940 --> 06:55.498
going into restricted areas.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.940
Restricted areas,
bombs and a dead guy.

06:57.980 --> 07:01.643
That's a recipe
for no good.
Mm.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.641
JAY: The guy on the right is the
library victim John Patton.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.612
Other guy is Harold Estes.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.480
He and Patton have
their own YouTube channel

07:09.530 --> 07:10.929
full of videos they shot
of all the places

07:10.960 --> 07:12.188
they explored together.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.697
Or broke into.
They're

07:13.730 --> 07:15.994
urban explorers,
also known as "place hackers."

07:16.030 --> 07:18.066
They look for abandoned
and deserted places,

07:18.100 --> 07:21.092
then they take pictures,
videos, whatever.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.005
And these guys were two
of the most well-known.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.065
Their videos have literally
hundreds of thousands of hits.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.476
All right, I see both guys
in a bunch of these.

07:27.510 --> 07:29.671
Who's holding the camera?

07:29.710 --> 07:31.701
That's a good question.
The ones you're talking about

07:31.750 --> 07:33.217
were posted
by some mysterious guy

07:33.250 --> 07:36.139
named GhostEx.
Why mysterious?

07:36.180 --> 07:38.683
Can't we just trace him
through his YouTube channel?

07:38.720 --> 07:39.687
Could take a while.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.779
I think I know a quicker way.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.754
There were a lot of
tickets on that fridge.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.094
Yeah, I know
these guys.

07:48.130 --> 07:50.564
Real pain in my ass,

07:50.600 --> 07:51.919
pardon my language.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.495
These urbex creeps,
they use service tunnels,

07:54.540 --> 07:56.098
abandoned subway lines,

07:56.140 --> 07:59.132
sewers, whatever to get
into places they shouldn't.
We're looking

07:59.170 --> 08:00.933
for the person
holding the camera.
And we don't

08:00.980 --> 08:02.106
have an ID.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.540
Our guy logs
into YouTube as "GhostEx."

08:04.580 --> 08:06.275
You got any ideas?

08:06.310 --> 08:07.743
It's probably this kid
named Alex.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.042
That would be the "Ex" part.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.889
Yeah.
Alex Daniels.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.683
He's a real wild one.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.711
Quick as a rabbit,
unpredictable.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.684
I pulled a hammy chasing
after him once.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.129
Two weeks disability.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.128
You seen any of them recently?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.889
Yeah. I gave that one,

08:22.930 --> 08:25.524
Harold, a citation
just yesterday.

08:25.570 --> 08:26.537
Where?

08:26.570 --> 08:27.867
Down around Foley Square.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.300
There's an old access
tunnel down there.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.103
It's like bees to honey.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.810
Back in the day,

08:44.850 --> 08:46.044
this whole area
was under water.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.785
It was called
the Collect Pond.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.685
Kind of like the
local reserv0|r.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.789
Nice. We could've gone
skinny-dipping.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.889
This was the 17005.
So?

08:53.930 --> 08:55.329
People haven't changed
that much.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.296
I'm sure they had skin that
occasionally needed... dipping.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.969
Frequently needed dipping.
Sometimes

09:02.000 --> 09:03.160
several times a day.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.837
Mm.

09:04.870 --> 09:07.805
Well, this part hasn't
changed much either, huh?

09:07.840 --> 09:10.775
Yeah. You used
to love a good stakeout.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.175
Did I?

09:12.210 --> 09:14.770
Yeah. We had a lot of fun.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.618
Right. Who wouldn't enjoy
listening to their partner

09:17.650 --> 09:20.653
recount Silver Spoons
episodes scene by scene?

09:20.690 --> 09:22.783
Facts of Life.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.183
Facts of Life.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.982
Yeah, that was a
little closer to what

09:26.030 --> 09:27.327
was going on.

09:31.230 --> 09:33.369
Hey.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.732
So, tell me, is it true?

09:35.770 --> 09:37.738
There alligators down there?

09:39.310 --> 09:41.631
Why don't you come down
and we'll find out.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.245
I got a better idea.

10:02.700 --> 10:05.089
Uh, is

10:05.130 --> 10:06.836
You don't know?

10:06.870 --> 10:09.907
We haven't seen each other
for a few weeks. We...

10:09.940 --> 10:12.306
John Patton's dead, Alex.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.138
That's why we brought you in.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.108
Dead?

10:21.150 --> 10:23.687
And his roommate Harold
Estes IS missmg.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.244
Do you know where he is?

10:25.290 --> 10:27.713
No...

10:27.760 --> 10:30.126
How did... how did John die?

10:30.160 --> 10:31.718
He was poisoned.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.125
Oh, my God.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.720
He was playing around
with RDX-- a lot of it.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.866
That's a chemical used to build
C-4. Any idea what he was doing

10:38.900 --> 10:42.904
with C
Uh, I have... I have no idea.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.728
John does what I do.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.749
I climb around buildings,
go underground, on bridges.

10:49.780 --> 10:53.011
I make videos and take pictures
for my blog. That's it.

10:53.050 --> 10:54.369
What about Harold?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.047
I don't know Harold
all that well.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.411
He was kind of new to the scene.

10:57.450 --> 11:00.954
He's more into treasure hunting.
That's not my thing.

11:00.990 --> 11:03.823
He turned John on to it, and...

11:03.860 --> 11:06.351
that's what came between us.

11:06.390 --> 11:09.097
So you guys had a falling out?

11:09.130 --> 11:11.860
ALEX:
Harold and John

11:11.900 --> 11:16.132
were being all secretive
about something.

11:16.170 --> 11:19.435
I guess I felt left out, and
when I talked to John about it,

11:19.470 --> 11:23.042
he just blew me off, so...

11:23.080 --> 11:26.971
Alex, it's very important
that we find Harold.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.989
You know how
to get in touch with him?

11:32.190 --> 11:34.181
No.

11:39.930 --> 11:41.898
We're getting nowhere with this.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.989
I got a pile of C-4
being made in this city,

11:44.030 --> 11:45.122
and I want to know why.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.035
Problem_is all
we got him on

11:47.070 --> 11:48.935
is a misdemeanor
trespassmg charge.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.164
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.099
I mean, can't you just go back
in there and play hardball?

11:53.140 --> 11:54.971
Hardball?
Okay, you got a bat?

11:55.010 --> 11:56.238
CARRIE:
Eliot, I think

11:56.280 --> 11:58.840
I see your point.
Let me take a shot at him.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.815
This... this is
what I'm saying.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.880
Hey, Alex.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.057
Remember me?

12:10.560 --> 12:12.926
Sure.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.191
And, uh, FYI: there aren't any.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.097
Alligators. In the sewers.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.164
Oh.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.509
Well, that's too bad.

12:23.540 --> 12:27.101
You wouldn't say that if you
were down there as much as me.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.973
You like crawling around
in the dark, don't you?

12:30.010 --> 12:31.944
I love it.

12:31.980 --> 12:35.017
I can show you;
the offer's still open.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.984
I have an offer for you.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.419
And I want you to think

12:38.450 --> 12:40.509
long and hard
before you turn me down, okay?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.551
Okay.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.423
I want you to come on board
as a special advisor.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.756
We have a bomb to find,
and I think you can help us.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.230
That... that's hardball?

12:53.270 --> 12:55.534
Yeah. She's not
really into sports.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.367
AL:
What I'm saying is

12:57.410 --> 13:00.004
I don't want to follow
some freak around the
sewers of New York

13:00.040 --> 13:02.201
when there's real
police work to be done.
There are no maps,

13:02.240 --> 13:05.243
no diagrams, no way
for us to get into any
of these places without him.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.147
For all we know,
he could be a part of all this.
In which case,

13:08.180 --> 13:10.011
_ he will be
right under our noses.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.019
In which case, he could
be keeping the bad guys
one step ahead of us.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.880
I have a good feeling
about him, Al.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.252
I'll bet you do.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.425
Hey, I think I might have found
what Patton was after.

13:22.460 --> 13:25.429
Okay, because of the RDX
traces he left behind,

13:25.470 --> 13:27.563
we were able
to gather all the Items

13:27.600 --> 13:29.431
Patton touched
while he was in the library.

13:29.470 --> 13:30.937
Seems he was obsessed

13:30.970 --> 13:33.609
with this guy, Alfred Goodrose.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.904
Now, Goodrose was a painter,
specifically a muralist,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.544
in the city back in the '205.

13:37.580 --> 13:40.378
Patton had this
man's actual diary

13:40.420 --> 13:41.375
with him when he died.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.411
And the interesting thing
about Goodrose is,

13:43.450 --> 13:47.079
supposedly he found
the famous Hussar Treasure.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.056
Not that famous; I got no idea
what you're talking about.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.198
The Hussar was
a British colonial ship

13:54.230 --> 13:56.095
loaded up with Spanish gold

13:56.130 --> 13:58.064
and Revolutionary
prisoners of war.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.931
In 1780, it ran aground

13:59.970 --> 14:01.198
in the East River and sank.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.935
Now, some folks think
that the British

14:02.970 --> 14:05.359
brought the gold ashore,
let the prisoners drown,

14:05.410 --> 14:06.638
leaving a curse on the treasure.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.137
Long story short, rumor is,

14:08.180 --> 14:10.341
Goodrose found the treasure,
spent a single

14:10.380 --> 14:13.247
gold coin, and then promptly
died of mysterious causes.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.111
Any of that in here?
No.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.038
It's just a diary; it's all:

14:17.090 --> 14:19.615
"I had mackerel for dinner,
my daughter's birthday's today,"

14:19.650 --> 14:20.548
stuff like that.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.581
So maybe John and Harold
found the treasure

14:22.620 --> 14:25.088
and one of them wanted
to keep it all for himself.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.928
Right. They're gonna need
explosives to get it,

14:27.960 --> 14:30.224
so Harold lets his partner
get poisoned

14:30.270 --> 14:32.226
by selling C4
without proper protection.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.965
That's a different
kind of curse.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.230
I just got a call from
my friends at the Coast Guard.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.635
You guys are
gonna want to see this.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.308
Just discovered it.

14:39.340 --> 14:41.069
CSU said best guess,

14:41.110 --> 14:42.577
the blast took place a week ago.

14:42.610 --> 14:44.976
How much C4 would you need
to make an explosion

14:45.010 --> 14:46.375
like that?
About the size

14:46.410 --> 14:47.479
of a football.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.045
Our guys are making
a heck of a lot more than that.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.581
And they're testing it
to make sure it works.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.058
Guys, I'm sorry, when I heard
about the blast site,

15:05.100 --> 15:08.035
I didn't have a choice--
I had to call Homeland Security.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.435
So that's it?
We're just off the case?

15:09.470 --> 15:11.461
I don't like it, either,
but they have

15:11.510 --> 15:13.330
r_ather strict
operational parameters.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.940
But we're already running down
leads, doing all the work.
Yeah, well,

15:15.980 --> 15:17.572
now we got a guy
making trial runs,

15:17.610 --> 15:20.647
plus-- and I'm probably
violating the Patriot Act
even saying this--

15:20.680 --> 15:22.477
I'm told that Mr. Patton

15:22.520 --> 15:26.183
and Mr. Estes have ties
to the Earth Liberation Front.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.552
Those spray-paint SUV
dealerships and tie
themselves to trees.

15:28.590 --> 15:31.252
Yeah. Homeland thinks they're
stepping up their game.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.997
The Oil and Gas Summit
meets this week in the city.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.726
They believe your C4 is
making its way there, so...

15:36.760 --> 15:38.489
I'm sorry, but we're done.

15:38.530 --> 15:39.792
I don't think so.
Homeland has

15:39.830 --> 15:43.607
the expertise,
they have the manpower...
We don't have to stop.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.461
What did I just say?
This is now a terrorism case,

15:46.510 --> 15:48.978
and DHS handles terrorism.
Exactly.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.341
DHS handles terrorism.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.441
Whether he was killed
or died by accident,

15:54.480 --> 15:55.640
the guy was making a bomb.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.649
John Patton was poisoned--
it is our job

15:58.690 --> 16:00.351
to figure out how and why.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.687
And if, along the way,

16:01.720 --> 16:04.029
we happen to stumble
onto something else,

16:04.060 --> 16:06.654
well, then...
it's a win-win.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.138
Oh, that is good.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.199
Good. She is good.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.502
You're gonna
clear it with DHS?

16:17.540 --> 16:20.008
Yeah, I think I will.
CARRIE:
Thank you.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.201
So we're still working
the case. Good,

16:22.240 --> 16:24.242
'cause I may have something.
Now, it turns out

16:24.280 --> 16:26.305
most of these urban explorer
dudes use a GPS device

16:26.350 --> 16:28.375
that sends e-mails
tracking where they are.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.512
It's a safety precaution.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.348
So I did some digging
on John and Harold's computers

16:32.390 --> 16:34.278
and found tons of visits
by the both of them

16:34.320 --> 16:35.218
over the past two weeks

16:35.260 --> 16:37.387
to the old City Hall
Subway Station area.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.386
Thing's been closed
and sealed up for decades.

16:39.430 --> 16:42.228
Well, that's great--
Alex can show me a way in.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.228
I'm coming with you.
Are you sure you're up to it?

16:44.270 --> 16:46.261
Up to it?
No, it's just,
I've been watching

16:46.300 --> 16:48.734
the videos, and it seems
very physically... challenging.

16:48.770 --> 16:49.998
Don't worry about me.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.531
You know, I-I should
leave you two...
No, no, no, you stay.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.401
You two just try
to keep up with me.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.140
Why are you laughing?
No, nothing.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.670
Why is she laughing?
You know what?
You should come.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.007
But be nice.

17:06.350 --> 17:08.409
Hey, you guys ready
for the nickel tour?
Yep.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.552
Put this on.

17:09.590 --> 17:11.421
We really need all this?

17:11.460 --> 17:14.054
I'll help you
with that.
Oh. Thanks.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.295
You know, these things,
they got to be tight

17:16.330 --> 17:18.423
in all the right places.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.698
Oh!

17:19.730 --> 17:21.561
Sorry.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.329
Don't be sorry.
Why are you sorry?

17:23.370 --> 17:24.564
It's dangerous
where we're going.

17:24.610 --> 17:27.738
And being your guide makes me
responsible for your safety.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.839
I can take care of myself.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.643
You good with carbon monoxide?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.341
Cave

17:33.380 --> 17:34.642
Look”.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.739
I don't have to worry
about you down there.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.782
You don't have
to worry about me.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.651
Yeah, you know what?
Don't worry about me, either.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.329
My pack's good.
I'm good.
Here's the deal, man.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.726
We're gonna take care of
each other down there.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.524
I see something you don't,
I'm gonna point that out.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.391
You see something I don't,
same thing.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.466
Okay, scout master, let's go.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.434
You were a scout?
Cool. What troop?

17:54.470 --> 17:56.461
Troop Move Your Ass.
You heard of it?

17:56.500 --> 17:58.263
ALEX: Give me
a hand, scout.

18:05.180 --> 18:06.602
Okay, there they are.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.379
We should be able to follow
as long as

18:08.420 --> 18:09.614
they don't go down too far.

18:11.620 --> 18:13.508
Here you go.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.755
You good

18:16.790 --> 18:19.554
Remember to stick
together, watch out
for those alligators.

18:22.530 --> 18:24.293
This way, guys.

18:35.510 --> 18:39.207
It's a pretty steady descent
to about 30 meters.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.616
That's when it starts
to get Interesting.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.718
These footholds can be
a little dicey,

18:46.750 --> 18:49.856
so if you get into trouble, Al,
you just call out.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.222
Thanks, I will.
The most
important thing

18:52.260 --> 18:54.353
is watching out
for each other.
Right, trust,

18:54.400 --> 18:55.799
just like he said.
ALEX:
Exactly.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.798
It might be hard, since
you weren't exactly

18:57.830 --> 18:59.695
up front with us about
Patton and Estes.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.266
What do you mean?

19:01.300 --> 19:03.404
They were both part of
the Earth Liberation Front.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.601
Are you kidding me?
I mean, John might've gone

19:05.640 --> 19:08.279
to a meeting once or twice,
but he was no ecoterrorist.

19:08.310 --> 19:09.538
How can you be sure?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.571
The dude thought
he was Indiana Jones.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.249
He was a dreamer.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.872
Come on.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.514
Whatever happened
to behaving yourself?

19:25.990 --> 19:29.551
CARRIE: So, how do you keep
from getting lost down here?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.761
Well, I make my living
as a mapmaker.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.939
It's how I got
into all this, but...

19:33.970 --> 19:35.562
really,
it's about seeing things,

19:35.600 --> 19:37.409
things other people don't see.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.830
Knowing what to look for,
what to look out for...

19:40.880 --> 19:43.269
Keeping it all tucked in here.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.971
It's kind of like
having a sixth sense.

19:45.010 --> 19:46.443
You know what I mean?

19:46.480 --> 19:49.210
Not really.
Yeah, actually, I do.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.615
Whoa-whoa! Look out.
Whoa.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.583
Thanks.

19:54.620 --> 19:56.281
My pleasure.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.958
Whoa, no-no-no!

19:57.990 --> 19:59.958
Don't... touch those.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.697
You never know which ones
are still carrying the current.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.928
All right?
It's a bit of a jump.
All right.

20:09.570 --> 20:10.832
Go ahead.

20:22.550 --> 20:24.381
Aw, damn it.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.713
Lost 'em.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.387
They're a hundred
feet down.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.455
It's too deep.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.491
*

20:45.570 --> 20:47.333
The old motorman's lounge...

20:47.380 --> 20:50.304
up until the '505,
when they abandoned the station.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.908
CARRIE: It's just been sitting
here like this,

20:51.950 --> 20:53.042
for half a century?

20:53.080 --> 20:54.547
ALEX: That's why
John came here.

20:54.580 --> 20:57.447
He loved the privacy.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.687
Being around the ghosts
of a lost way of life.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.621
Yeah, you certainly
do get your privacy.

21:03.660 --> 21:06.982
Guess it depends what
you need the privacy for.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.396
Come on, guys,

21:09.430 --> 21:11.660
take a load off.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.668
Doesn't look like
a bomb factory to me.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.432
I've seen this room before.

21:23.910 --> 21:26.470
JAY: They're urban explorers,
also known as "placehackers."

21:26.510 --> 21:30.344
They look for abandoned
and deserted places...

21:32.420 --> 21:34.650
Something's different.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.792
Where does that door go?

21:47.840 --> 21:48.795
I don't know.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.034
It's always been locked.

21:50.070 --> 21:51.537
Not always.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.877
What the hell?

22:00.150 --> 22:02.869
Come on, after you.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.924
Al, this is it.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.929
Blasting caps, RDX,
the whole nine yards.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.064
Oh, man.

22:18.100 --> 22:21.092
And no protective gear.

22:21.140 --> 22:24.439
This is where John was poisoned.

22:24.470 --> 22:27.871
ALEX:
I made that map for John.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.901
He was here. I can't...

22:29.940 --> 22:31.749
I can't believe
he'd be involved

22:31.780 --> 22:32.849
in anything like this.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.041
Yeah, you said that,
several times.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.741
CARRIE:
What was that?

22:36.780 --> 22:38.486
AL: That's a fuse.
The place is rigged.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.044
Come on, get out!

22:40.090 --> 22:42.911
AL:
Run! Go! Hurry! Go, go! Run!

22:58.170 --> 22:59.467
Are you okay?

22:59.510 --> 23:00.602
Yeah. You?

23:00.640 --> 23:01.732
Yeah, I'm okay.

23:04.110 --> 23:05.873
Alex?

23:05.910 --> 23:07.844
Alex!

23:07.880 --> 23:08.972
Here.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.551
That leg feels pretty bad.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.929
All right, just stay
as still as you can.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.120
We'll get you out.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.593
Thanks.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.120
Our packs are buried.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.536
ALEX: _
They're never gonna fInd us.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.629
I think
we're too far down for the GPS.

23:30.670 --> 23:33.002
We got to get you out of here.
Can you walk?

23:35.540 --> 23:36.768
There's no way, guys.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.675
I'm sorry.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.748
I can get out, Al.
I remember the way.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.213
Carrie.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.945
You could get trapped
out there.

23:45.990 --> 23:47.582
There could be
other bombs.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.952
I got to try, right?

23:49.990 --> 23:51.787
You stay with him.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.957
I'll get help, okay?

23:55.900 --> 23:59.222
Hey, we've been in worse
situations than this.

23:59.270 --> 24:01.659
Really

24:02.900 --> 24:04.162
Hey.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.500
Yeah.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.542
Me, too.

24:13.950 --> 24:15.542
Carrie?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.582
Be careful.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.186
You're all right.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.824
What's the status. Murray?

24:26.860 --> 24:29.556
We had our last contact at
Warren Street, but lost them.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.794
Then came the blast.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.991
Fire department and EMTs are
moving into the explosion area.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.839
We still have no confirmation
that's where they are.

24:34.870 --> 24:36.030
I'm heading down there.

24:36.070 --> 24:37.731
Yeah, we're responding.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.679
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

24:59.730 --> 25:01.220
No. No. No.

25:01.260 --> 25:03.990
No!

25:14.980 --> 25:16.936
Didn't know
you guys were a thing.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.972
We're partners.
Hold still.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.978
Lots of...

25:22.020 --> 25:24.944
different kinds of partners.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.582
What kind are you?

25:26.620 --> 25:28.713
Partner partners.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.955
So, not a thing.

25:32.190 --> 25:33.726
Depends on how you look at it.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.557
How's that?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.124
It's great. Thanks.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.993
How do you look at it?

25:41.770 --> 25:43.829
Oh, no.
What?

25:43.870 --> 25:45.167
Hydrogen sulfide. It's pretty
common at this level.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.302
It must be seeping in

25:46.340 --> 25:47.705
from somewhere.
And?

25:47.740 --> 25:49.276
It's really poisonous,
really bad.

25:49.310 --> 25:51.574
Don't worry. We're gonna get out
of here. I'm gonna carry you.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.579
Okay? Come on.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.144
Come on.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.910
I can't. I can't do that.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.281
We're gonna die if we don't
get out of here, right?

26:00.320 --> 26:02.618
Okay?

26:02.660 --> 26:03.854
Okay.

26:03.890 --> 26:06.188
That's it.

26:06.230 --> 26:08.221
AL: I'll come from
the other side.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.964
All right,
we're gonna make it.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.319
Let's go.

26:15.070 --> 26:18.039
If it's in the tunnels...
I know, I know.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.071
Okay.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.888
ALEX:
The footholds in here
are a little dicey,

26:35.920 --> 26:38.957
so, if you get in trouble, Al,
just call out.

26:38.990 --> 26:41.026
AL
Thanks. I will.

27:24.370 --> 27:26.406
How you doing?

27:26.440 --> 27:28.408
I think I'm supposed
to ask you that.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.079
I'm fine. Just let me
know if I pass out.

27:31.110 --> 27:32.202
All right.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.178
Let's catch our breath right
here, right here, come here.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.108
Come here.

27:38.150 --> 27:40.243
There you go.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.450
Where are we?

27:44.490 --> 27:48.119
20 meters, you go left
under Duane Street.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.889
And if the tunnel's open,

27:49.930 --> 27:52.763
it's another 120
meters after that.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.002
Yes!

27:59.070 --> 28:01.231
Hello?!

28:01.280 --> 28:02.929
Somebody else over here!
Give me your hand.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.072
We got you.
Take it easy, m'am.

28:04.110 --> 28:05.179
We gotta get down there.

28:05.210 --> 28:06.006
Marty Auerbach,
Transit Police.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.779
I talked with
A! Burns yesterday.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.072
Yeah, yeah, you helped us
find Alex.
Yeah.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.781
Thank God you got out.
What can I do to help?

28:11.820 --> 28:13.185
They're down by the old
motorman's lounge.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.812
There was an explosion.
We got to get 'em out.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.179
I know. We heard about
the blast on the radio.
Okay.

28:16.220 --> 28:18.154
I know these tunnels
like the back of my hand.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.055
You've been through hell.
You need to get checked out.

28:20.090 --> 28:22.854
My partner's down there.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.891
I know.

28:24.930 --> 28:26.466
I'll find him.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.229
Okay.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.261
Pete, take care
of this lady.
Yes, sir.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.101
AL:
All right, ready?

28:39.150 --> 28:40.299
Yeah, mm-hmm.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.208
Wait, wait, wait.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.410
Did you hear that?

28:45.450 --> 28:46.940
Yeah.

28:46.990 --> 28:49.049
Hey, I got an injured person
down here!

28:49.090 --> 28:50.387
We need some help!

28:50.420 --> 28:51.887
MARTY:
Lieutenant Burns?

28:51.930 --> 28:54.194
AL:
Hey!

28:54.230 --> 28:57.290
Lieutenant Burns!

29:00.170 --> 29:02.195
Oh.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.129
Thank God you're okay.

29:08.940 --> 29:11.272
All right,
I'll pay those tickets.

29:11.310 --> 29:13.505
Yeah.

29:13.550 --> 29:14.949
Great. Thanks.

29:14.980 --> 29:17.016
Hey, Jay?

29:17.050 --> 29:18.813
Hey, Carrie,
great to hear your voice.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.340
Yeah, likewise.
What do you got for me?

29:20.390 --> 29:23.154
Still can't get a reading on
either one of the guys' GPSes,

29:23.190 --> 29:24.919
but, uh, maybe I can find a way
to drop a sensor.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.086
It's all right.
We're bringing 'em up.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.222
Great.
Is that Carrie?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.352
Yup.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.492
Hey, Jo.

29:29.530 --> 29:30.827
Oh, thank God you're okay.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.768
Listen, Carrie, I think I found

29:31.800 --> 29:32.323
your missing place hacker,
Harold Estes.

29:32.370 --> 29:33.496
Where?

29:33.530 --> 29:36.090
He's in a thousand tiny pieces

29:36.140 --> 29:36.765
at the beach blast site.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.439
The explosion atomized him.

29:39.470 --> 29:41.335
Are you sure?
WEBSTER:
I ran the DNA.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.574
It's a match.

29:42.610 --> 29:44.305
But that explosion happened
over a week ago.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.305
Transit cop we talked to said

29:45.350 --> 29:47.170
he gave Harold a ticket
day before yesterday.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.269
Marty Auerbach.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.083
Yeah, that's the guy.
No, that's impossible.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.417
Harold's been dead a week.

29:52.450 --> 29:54.054
Science doesn't lie.

29:54.090 --> 29:56.558
Then Marty Auerbach did.

29:56.590 --> 30:00.321
Listen, Jay, dig up everything
you can on him.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.588
I'm going back in.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.825
Hey, I need two guys over here!

30:14.480 --> 30:15.833
It's to the left.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.233
Alex says it's this way.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.168
Yeah, he's right,
but they're working on the gas

30:19.210 --> 30:20.575
all the way back
to the main line.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.339
This is actually faster.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.357
We can't get to 'em.

30:30.390 --> 30:31.926
Room's flooded with sulfide gas.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.450
Okay, we've dug up more
information on Marty.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.492
Turns out he's got a demolitions
license, and two months ago,

30:35.530 --> 30:37.293
he signed for a
shipment of RDX

30:37.330 --> 30:38.592
using a personal credit
card to pay for it.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.359
We got to get to them
before Marty does.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.436
Okay, that's Jay.
Alex's GPS is pinging.

30:42.470 --> 30:43.437
Great. Where?

30:43.470 --> 30:44.607
Duane Street and Lafayette.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.904
All right, let's go.
They're on the move.

30:46.940 --> 30:50.205
Most people don't even
know this track exists.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.605
When they widened
the trains,

30:51.650 --> 30:54.016
the city just built
different tunnels.

30:54.050 --> 30:56.177
This is weird.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.346
We're going down.

30:57.380 --> 30:59.211
All right.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.410
Where are we exactly?

31:00.450 --> 31:02.554
At our destination.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.654
Right this way, gentlemen.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.123
Freedom awaits.

31:18.170 --> 31:21.378
Hey, open the door!

31:21.410 --> 31:22.604
Hey!

31:26.380 --> 31:28.177
Tunnel's too narrow.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.041
There's an indent-- it's
for the service workers.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.182
Come on, let's go!

31:32.220 --> 31:33.312
Step off.
I can't go.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.681
Okay, here...

31:49.340 --> 31:50.261
Jay, are you sure?

31:50.300 --> 31:53.098
We are here,
and there is no sign of them.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.505
JAY:
I'm still getting a signal.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.007
He's got to be there.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.270
I don't see...

32:00.680 --> 32:02.238
Ha!

32:05.750 --> 32:07.479
Oh. Hey, you.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.680
Sorry. You okay?

32:08.720 --> 32:10.517
Give me a hand.
Okay.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.585
He saved my life.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.598
That's quite a boyfriend
you got there.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.996
Yeah. Boyfriend?
Boyfriend?

32:20.200 --> 32:23.966
Listen, Marty's target
for the O4 is underground.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.604
Or he's just using the tunnels
to get to whatever he's after.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.971
No, in that room we found,

32:28.010 --> 32:29.534
there was an empty box
of blasting caps.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.548
Whatever he's after,
he's after it now.

32:31.580 --> 32:32.672
You got any ideas?

32:32.710 --> 32:34.314
No. I mean,
Marty was just around.

32:34.350 --> 32:35.510
He was the law,

32:35.550 --> 32:37.575
and we didn't want any more
tickets than we already had.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.680
The truth is, we knew those
tunnels much better than he did.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.151
ALEX:
I made that map for John.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.658
Alex, in the bomb room,
there was a map

32:48.700 --> 32:51.191
that you made for John.
What was it?

32:51.230 --> 32:53.095
I didn't get a good look.
I mean, I made a lot of maps

32:53.130 --> 32:54.995
for John, mostly places
we liked--

32:55.040 --> 32:57.634
abandoned subway tunnels,
some ventilation shafts.

32:57.670 --> 32:59.558
What was the last map
you made for him?

32:59.610 --> 33:01.475
I think I did one
of the Financial District.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.239
Why the Financial District?
To rob a bank?
No, no.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.679
It was all
that Hussar treasure business.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.200
John thought it might be
around there.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.070
Why?
No idea.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.542
Treasure hunters don't usually
share their secrets.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.616
They're paranoid.
Everything is code with them.

33:11.650 --> 33:13.083
Blah, blah, blah.
That's why I hate it.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.088
Code. Maybe that's it.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.509
Maybe John was trying to break
a code at the library.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.652
He had that diary.

33:18.690 --> 33:20.123
Alfred Goodrose's diary.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.593
But there was nothing in that.

33:21.630 --> 33:23.723
Maybe there was,
and we didn't understand it.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.092
It was open to a page...

33:26.130 --> 33:27.620
AL:
A lot of viruses in hospitals.

33:27.670 --> 33:30.594
Could he have caught
what killed him there?

33:31.640 --> 33:34.609
CARRIE:
"September 1, 1927.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.436
"My daughter

33:35.480 --> 33:39.143

33:39.180 --> 33:40.602

33:42.520 --> 33:44.283

33:47.650 --> 33:49.356
Sta rs.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.427
Guided by the stars.

33:52.460 --> 33:54.291
ALEX:
Really, it's about
seeing things.

33:54.330 --> 33:58.619
Seeing things
other people don't.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.524
Knowing what to look for.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.140
I got it.

34:17.220 --> 34:19.688
Jay, I need you to tell me

34:19.720 --> 34:21.381
who painted the mural

34:21.420 --> 34:23.684
above John's head
in the library.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.527
No way.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.858
Alfred Goodrose.

34:29.900 --> 34:30.855
I want you to cross-reference
anything about that mural

34:30.900 --> 34:32.527
with his daughter's birthday.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.834
September 1, 1927,
she was eight years old.

34:34.870 --> 34:37.168
It's all there.

34:37.200 --> 34:40.237
Guided by the stars,
treasure, the birthday.

34:40.270 --> 34:41.498
Holy smokes.

34:41.540 --> 34:42.370
VVhat

34:42.410 --> 34:44.674
The painting is
of the exact night slq

34:44.710 --> 34:47.201
of September 1, 1927,

34:47.250 --> 34:49.343
only seen
from a very specific location.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.870
What location?

34:50.920 --> 34:54.356
It could be anywhere.

34:55.490 --> 34:57.458
Wait a minute.

34:57.490 --> 35:01.199
That's the
St. Paul's Chapel spire.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.891
It's on the northeast side

35:02.930 --> 35:04.659
because you can see the portico
with the columns.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.668
Goodrose painted

35:06.700 --> 35:09.237
the map to the treasure;
he painted it.

35:09.270 --> 35:11.135
Jay, can you send me
those coordinates?

35:11.170 --> 35:12.501
Text them to us, Jay.

35:12.540 --> 35:14.576
Marty's probably already there.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.339
Hold on, guys.
I'm coming with you.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.772
These coordinates
can't be right.

35:19.810 --> 35:21.675
You can't see
the Chapel spire from here.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.813
Yeah, well, they've built a
few things since the '205.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.613
That's why Patton had to
double-check everything.

35:25.650 --> 35:27.641
Goodrose's world has
basically disappeared.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.329
There are people everywhere.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.725
If het sets off an explosion
down here,

35:33.760 --> 35:35.193
there could be thousands
of casualties.

35:35.230 --> 35:36.527
Wait a second.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.528
He wouldn't work out
in the open like this, right?

35:38.570 --> 35:39.628
So where is he?

35:39.670 --> 35:41.297
He's underneath.
How did I know

35:41.340 --> 35:42.432
you were gonna say that?
There's another station.

35:42.470 --> 35:43.494
It's the original one,

35:43.540 --> 35:44.609
built in the '205.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.198
Goodrose's era.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.059
They just built this one
right on top of it.

35:47.110 --> 35:48.737
Get with the MTA and
the fire department.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.475
Start evacuating the
area immediately.

35:50.510 --> 35:51.670
How do we get down there?

35:51.710 --> 35:53.701
Ventilation shaft.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.646
All right.
FIREMAN: No way, buddy.

36:00.690 --> 36:01.759
_ You're not
gorng down there.

36:01.790 --> 36:02.882
ALEX:
Guys...

36:02.920 --> 36:05.480
I can't go.

36:05.530 --> 36:08.192
But we can.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.357
All right, let's do this.

36:32.250 --> 36:34.252
Drilling.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.827
AL:
Police!

36:46.470 --> 36:47.721
Drop it.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.489
No, I don't think I will.

36:50.540 --> 36:53.998
Behind that wall,
in a sealed-off aqueduct,

36:54.040 --> 36:55.507
is the Hussar Treasure.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.337
Thousands have
looked for it,

36:57.380 --> 36:58.449
but I found it.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.368
No, you killed the men
who found it.

37:00.410 --> 37:01.946
Patton and Estes were dreamers.

37:01.980 --> 37:03.516
I had a system.

37:03.550 --> 37:06.383
I had access to half a century
of subway maps.

37:06.420 --> 37:08.251
I found it; I deserve it.

37:08.290 --> 37:09.552
Yeah? What about the people
above us?

37:09.590 --> 37:10.750
Do they deserve to die?

37:10.790 --> 37:12.485
I know what I'm doing.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.748
The only two people
that are gonna get hurt

37:14.800 --> 37:15.892
are you and your partner.

37:15.930 --> 37:17.693
That's not gonna happen.

37:17.730 --> 37:18.799
Put that down.

37:18.830 --> 37:20.798
This?

37:22.800 --> 37:23.960
Sure.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.366
Oops.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.538
Now, you can chase me or you
can save the people topside,

37:29.580 --> 37:30.831
but you can't do both.

37:33.010 --> 37:34.648
AL:
Start pulling them.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.721
I'll get these.

37:53.370 --> 37:54.337
Al,

37:54.370 --> 37:55.530
we can't get to this one.

37:55.570 --> 37:56.559
It's too high.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.659
That'll cave in
the whole ceiling.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.436
Hope that climbing
wall pays off.

38:03.480 --> 38:07.075
Actually, this is how
you steal eggs

38:07.110 --> 38:09.010
out of birds' nests.

38:09.050 --> 38:12.349
Didn't they teach you that
at scout school?

38:13.720 --> 38:15.915
Guess I missed that lesson.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.383
You were too busy flirting
with the Brownies.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.091
You...
Yep.

38:22.130 --> 38:23.995
just earned yourself
a merit badge.

38:24.030 --> 38:25.964
For what?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.422
Saving the day.

38:27.470 --> 38:28.664
Oh.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.031
I'll go halfsies with you.

38:30.070 --> 38:32.630
(subway train rumbling,
wheels screeching along rails)

38:42.620 --> 38:43.917
Hey, Marty.

38:43.950 --> 38:47.579
You know the Hussar Treasure
comes With a curse, right?

39:14.080 --> 39:16.378
Where are you
taking me now?

39:16.420 --> 39:17.876
It's a surprise.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.888
Really?
What's wrong?
You're not up to it?

39:19.920 --> 39:22.388
Oh, I'm up to it.

39:22.420 --> 39:25.548
All right, hold this.

39:41.210 --> 39:43.405
Wow.
Right?

39:43.440 --> 39:46.147
This is amazing.

39:47.110 --> 39:48.179
Looks even better

39:48.210 --> 39:51.680
with some of this.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.518
How did you find this place?

39:54.560 --> 39:55.959
Alex told me about it.

39:55.990 --> 39:58.185
Guess the kid's got something
to recommend him.

39:58.220 --> 40:01.519
You weren't really jealous
of him, were you?

40:01.560 --> 40:03.494
Me Of what?

40:03.530 --> 40:05.498
His beard?

40:05.530 --> 40:07.794
You want me to grow a beard?

40:07.830 --> 40:10.094
No, I would kill you.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.764
Oh, look at this.

40:13.810 --> 40:14.936
We're a long way

40:14.980 --> 40:16.538
from the rock quarry
in Syracuse.

40:16.580 --> 40:20.038
Yes, we are.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.071
Those were some good days.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.747
So are these.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.718
Who knows?

40:32.760 --> 40:34.728
This city's got
a million mysteries.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.126
That's why I love it.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.594
Let's stay a while.

40:39.630 --> 40:41.097
Well, I think
we're gonna get wet.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.098
No, I mean here in the city.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.131
Partners.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.869
Hey, Al...

40:54.950 --> 40:56.713
Yeah.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.843
Me, too.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.651
