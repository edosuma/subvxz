WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:04.933
I got news. Where's Daddy?

00:04.934 --> 00:06.698
He hasn't got home from work yet.

00:06.699 --> 00:08.199
Is this about chemtrails?

00:08.200 --> 00:10.701
Because I do not have the
energy for that right now.

00:10.702 --> 00:12.670
What's going on, Bobby?

00:12.671 --> 00:15.006
Okay, look, if I tell you
the news, you promise

00:15.007 --> 00:16.807
you're gonna act just as
excited when he gets home

00:16.808 --> 00:17.842
and I say it again?

00:17.843 --> 00:19.510
No.

00:19.511 --> 00:20.645
(door opens)

00:20.646 --> 00:22.213
Hey, everybody. Gather round.

00:22.214 --> 00:23.781
I got something I need to tell you.

00:23.782 --> 00:24.916
I got news, too, Daddy.

00:24.917 --> 00:27.218
Sorry, Bobby, I need to go first.

00:27.219 --> 00:29.487
Now, my sister called today,
and she told me

00:29.488 --> 00:31.088
that my father died.

00:31.089 --> 00:34.292
I just saw Cam Newton
at the grocery store!

00:34.293 --> 00:36.861
Wait a minute,
did you say Granddad is dead?

00:36.862 --> 00:38.796
Oh, Joe, I'm so sorry.

00:38.797 --> 00:40.164
We're here for you.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.799
Well, you know what
they say. People die.

00:44.201 --> 00:45.636
Joe, you don't have
to act strong for us.

00:45.637 --> 00:47.038
Just give yourself time to grieve.

00:47.039 --> 00:48.706
No, I've had time to grieve, Maxine.

00:48.707 --> 00:50.875
My sister called about five hours ago.

00:50.876 --> 00:53.277
I had time to grieve, ate at Wendy's,

00:53.278 --> 00:55.580
got my car washed,
drove back to Wendy's,

00:55.581 --> 00:58.449
ordered a Frosty, came
home, told y'all the news.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.384
That's a pretty full day.

01:00.385 --> 01:02.286
- What's going on right now?
- Maxine,

01:02.287 --> 01:03.921
death is not all about grieving.

01:03.922 --> 01:05.756
It's sometimes a celebration.

01:05.757 --> 01:10.561
We believe that when you pass,
you go to a better place.

01:10.562 --> 01:12.463
Oh, that's funny.

01:12.464 --> 01:15.432
'Cause I believe Grandpa went to hell.

01:17.268 --> 01:18.703
- Jerrod!
- What?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.671
Am I the only one that
remembers what a deadbeat

01:20.672 --> 01:22.406
- the man was?
- Jerrod,

01:22.407 --> 01:24.875
enough. Joe, I am going to go cook you

01:24.876 --> 01:28.311
the most beautiful dead
dad cake you've ever seen.

01:31.882 --> 01:34.118
Don't speak ill of the dead,
son. You didn't know this man,

01:34.119 --> 01:35.653
and you don't know
what you're talking about.

01:35.654 --> 01:38.189
He was never there and
left you when you were a kid.

01:38.190 --> 01:39.423
He never sent any money.

01:39.424 --> 01:41.258
When's the last time
you even saw the man?

01:41.259 --> 01:43.194
Well, we ran into each
other a couple years ago

01:43.195 --> 01:45.296
at the JCPenney's.

01:45.297 --> 01:46.931
He came over to me and he said,

01:46.932 --> 01:49.667
"Hey, is that a Wetzel Pretzel
you got?" I said, "Yeah."

01:49.668 --> 01:51.435
He said, "Are you allowed
to bring that in here?"

01:51.436 --> 01:54.037
I said, "I don't know." And then
we went our separate ways.

01:55.039 --> 01:58.843
Man, I can't believe Granddad is dead.

01:58.844 --> 02:00.630
Matter of fact, I don't even
know if that was Cam Newton

02:00.631 --> 02:02.612
I even saw at the store.

02:03.515 --> 02:06.517
It's the worst day of my life.

02:06.518 --> 02:08.151
Quit pretending to be sad, Bobby.

02:08.152 --> 02:10.187
- You met Granddad, like, twice.
- So what?

02:10.187 --> 02:11.989
I know people that's met the Pope once,

02:11.990 --> 02:14.124
and it changed their life tremendously.

02:15.026 --> 02:17.028
Who do you know that's met the Pope?

02:17.029 --> 02:19.230
Fred.

02:19.231 --> 02:22.299
You don't know anyone that's met
the Pope, and you don't know

02:22.300 --> 02:24.201
anyone named Fred.
You're just one of those people

02:24.202 --> 02:26.504
who likes to show grief
publicly for attention.

02:26.505 --> 02:28.272
We all know what
you're gonna do, Bobby.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.408
You're just gonna post a picture
of yourself looking sad

02:30.409 --> 02:35.345
on Instagram with a caption that
says "RIP Granddad" underneath.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.549
So?

02:38.550 --> 02:40.184
Let me tell you something,

02:40.185 --> 02:42.286
you got to look sad on
Instagram sometimes.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.121
You got to keep your
followers intrigued.

02:44.122 --> 02:48.325
You know, they-they need to
see all facets of Bobby.

02:48.326 --> 02:50.261
MAXINE: You know what,

02:50.262 --> 02:52.797
Jerrod, it-it's totally normal

02:52.798 --> 02:55.599
for Bobby to grieve the
loss of his grandfather.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.201
See, Jerrod? You-you don't understand.

02:57.202 --> 02:59.970
It's okay to be sad. You need to
get in touch with your emotions.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.107
You know something? You need
to see the movie <i>Inside Out.</i>

03:03.108 --> 03:06.409
I'm not gonna tell you
what happens to Bing Bong.

03:07.211 --> 03:10.380
But he dies.

Maxine, what

04:08.038 --> 04:10.306
a risqué dress that is

04:10.307 --> 04:12.141
for such a somber occasion.

04:12.142 --> 04:13.475
Oh, it's just that it's my first funeral,

04:13.476 --> 04:15.711

It's been a hard few days

JOE: Cynthia,

04:45.208 --> 04:46.968
did you get the music to the organist?

04:46.969 --> 04:47.903
Yes, Joe.

04:47.904 --> 04:48.904
What about the flowers?

04:48.905 --> 04:50.238
The-the white roses, right?

04:50.239 --> 04:52.140
Everything's taken care of, baby.

04:52.141 --> 04:53.642
Why are you going all-out for this man?

04:53.643 --> 04:54.943
He wasn't there for you in life.

04:54.944 --> 04:56.945
- Why are you being there for him now?
- Because

04:56.946 --> 04:58.914
that's what you do
when your father dies.

04:58.915 --> 05:01.717
Now, I'm gonna bury my father,
just like he buried his,

05:01.718 --> 05:03.819
the same way you two
are gonna do for me.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.187
Daddy, I'm gonna bury
you real good, too.

05:07.989 --> 05:10.525
We're gonna have a... we're
gonna have a band for you,

05:10.526 --> 05:12.437
a-a gold casket,

05:12.438 --> 05:14.473
and, matter of fact, we gonna
do the fireworks, right,

05:14.474 --> 05:15.731
where-where your name pops up

05:15.732 --> 05:19.334
and-and blow up in the sky. "Joe."

05:19.335 --> 05:22.471
Man, I can't wait for that.

05:22.472 --> 05:25.073
Thank you, Bobby.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.342
Bobby, there's a huge difference.

05:27.343 --> 05:28.877
We actually love our father.

05:28.878 --> 05:30.579
Funerals are not about love.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.214
They're about obligation.

05:32.215 --> 05:35.083
Now, I'm the only one that's
gonna stand up for this man.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.319
My sister's not flying in.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.788
Our mama's not gonna come.
Last time she saw him,

05:39.789 --> 05:42.524
I was ten years old and he was
walking out the front door.

05:42.525 --> 05:44.379
Joe, you have organized

05:44.380 --> 05:46.682
a beautiful service for your father.

05:46.683 --> 05:49.684
Plus, you're scoring points with God.

05:49.685 --> 05:52.954
This might make up for the fact
that you didn't leave a note

05:52.955 --> 05:56.257
on that car you sideswiped
in that parking lot.

05:57.626 --> 05:59.593
Listen, Dad, all I'm saying is,

05:59.594 --> 06:01.996
you would've never thrown
a party for this man in life.

06:01.997 --> 06:05.433
Yet you're down, like,
two grand on his death. Why?

06:05.434 --> 06:07.368
- Funerals are for the living, Jerrod.
- No.

06:07.369 --> 06:09.335
Carnival Cruises are for the living.

06:10.205 --> 06:11.440
You're missing the point.

06:11.441 --> 06:13.275
Funerals are for people
to have a place to go

06:13.276 --> 06:15.944
to release their emotions
and gain closure.

06:15.945 --> 06:17.468
CYNTHIA: And for singing songs

06:17.469 --> 06:18.747
and wearing black.

06:18.748 --> 06:21.083
Which happens to be my best color.

06:21.084 --> 06:24.052
And I have an amazing singing voice.

06:24.053 --> 06:26.121
Ooh, I am incredible at funerals.

06:26.122 --> 06:27.255
JOE: Oh, that's true.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.423
You should have seen her

06:28.424 --> 06:30.125
at our nephew Brandon's funeral.

06:30.126 --> 06:32.693
She sang song after song.
Five songs in a row.

06:32.694 --> 06:35.464
- We could've sold that as an EP.
- (laughs)

06:35.465 --> 06:39.067
Mama, if you sang "Ave Maria"
on <i>The Voice,</i>

06:39.068 --> 06:41.669
ooh, that's a four-chair turn.

06:42.971 --> 06:45.841
Even Christina,
and she don't like nobody.

06:45.842 --> 06:47.809
Cousin Brandon's funeral.

06:47.810 --> 06:50.579
Yet another great service
for a terrible person.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.348
I remember everyone telling
sweet stories, saying things

06:53.349 --> 06:55.917
like, "Oh, Brandon was
taken away too soon."

06:55.918 --> 06:58.186
Cousin Brandon was taken away too soon.

06:58.187 --> 07:00.822
Cousin Brandon was shot while
holding up a convenience store

07:00.823 --> 07:03.692
at gunpoint, and they still
released doves at his funeral.

07:03.693 --> 07:07.529
Jerrod, why do you always
see the bad in people?

07:07.530 --> 07:09.431
He literally stole from
everybody in the family.

07:09.432 --> 07:11.466
Yet, at his funeral,
someone played the trumpet

07:11.467 --> 07:13.101
as they lowered his
casket into the ground,

07:13.102 --> 07:14.401
like he was a soldier.

07:15.537 --> 07:17.305
During his eulogy, they referred to him

07:17.306 --> 07:19.608
as a spontaneous entrepreneur.

07:19.609 --> 07:22.544
He was a drug dealer.

07:22.545 --> 07:25.180
Damn, I need to write that eulogy.

07:25.181 --> 07:26.815
Now, look, this isn't a debate.

07:26.816 --> 07:29.084
I spent good money on today,
and we're gonna get

07:29.085 --> 07:31.219
in my car and we're going
over to that funeral home

07:31.220 --> 07:32.788
and we're gonna bury my father

07:32.789 --> 07:35.356
and we will enjoy ourselves.

07:36.391 --> 07:37.758
Then we're going to Wendy's.

07:41.897 --> 07:44.866
Thank you so much for coming.
Come right on in.

07:44.867 --> 07:46.668
Beautiful dress. There you are.

07:46.669 --> 07:48.503
A program for you.
Here's one for you, baby.

07:48.504 --> 07:50.471
Come right this way. Oh,

07:50.472 --> 07:53.008
and take a tissue, because
we're puttin' on a show.

07:53.009 --> 07:54.609
(chuckles)

07:54.610 --> 07:56.044
Hey, hey. Ooh, sorry.

07:56.045 --> 07:58.480
Look, could you play the song
they play at baseball games?

07:58.481 --> 08:00.649
It's called, um... I-I'll show you.

08:00.650 --> 08:02.783
(humming "Charge")

08:07.956 --> 08:10.358
Charge!

08:10.359 --> 08:12.060
That's what it's called.
It's called "Charge."

08:12.061 --> 08:14.262
I'll help you. Come on. Scoot over.

08:14.263 --> 08:16.731
Death.

08:16.732 --> 08:20.001
Darkness.

08:20.002 --> 08:22.002
Why are you so hard to write for?

08:22.838 --> 08:25.974
Darkness. Coffin. Painting.

08:25.975 --> 08:28.476
Flowers. Oh, come on, Joe.

08:28.477 --> 08:31.146
Now you're just naming
stuff in the room.

08:31.147 --> 08:34.015
Dad, you still in here,
stuck on that eulogy?

08:34.015 --> 08:36.183
Yes, I'm stuck, son.
I don't know what to write.

08:36.184 --> 08:37.684
It's like I hit a brick wall.

08:37.686 --> 08:40.488
I got what they call that
Dale Earnhardt Syndrome.

08:40.489 --> 08:43.124
No. Pretty sure that's
called writer's block.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.759
No, I always heard it as
Dale Earnhardt Syndrome.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.461
You know, on account
of when he was racing

08:46.462 --> 08:47.596
- and he hit that brick wall...
- No, no, no.

08:47.597 --> 08:49.097
I know why you're calling it that.

08:49.098 --> 08:51.299
But no one says that.
They just say "writer's block."

08:51.300 --> 08:52.467
Well, maybe we're both right.

08:52.468 --> 08:54.436
We are not both... Look, Dad,

08:54.437 --> 08:56.905
I know why you're stuck:
because you're being insincere.

08:56.906 --> 08:59.307
Your heart's trying to keep
your brain from lying.

08:59.308 --> 09:01.009
Jerrod, it is not insincere

09:01.010 --> 09:04.045
to talk about the dead with respect.

09:04.046 --> 09:05.480
Now, what's a nicer way of saying

09:05.481 --> 09:09.050
"a cold-hearted son of a bitch"?

09:09.051 --> 09:11.086
Just go out there and say
"cold-hearted son of a bitch."

09:11.087 --> 09:12.454
Or don't go out there at all.

09:12.455 --> 09:14.356
I don't know why you're
making yourself do this.

09:14.357 --> 09:16.591
I don't know why it's so hard
to piece together nice things

09:16.592 --> 09:18.293
to say about my father.

09:18.294 --> 09:21.162
Oh. He drove a Chevy.

09:21.163 --> 09:22.998
Well, that's more of a fact, though.

09:22.999 --> 09:24.833
CYNTHIA: Joe,

09:24.834 --> 09:26.500
you're still not finished?

09:26.501 --> 09:29.037
Oh, somebody got a case
of the Dale Earnhardts.

09:29.038 --> 09:30.605
Told you!

09:30.606 --> 09:32.407
I don't know why this is so hard.

09:32.408 --> 09:36.211
Joe, I don't want to stress you
out any more, but there are

09:36.212 --> 09:39.648
crowds of people out there
that are waiting to be moved.

09:39.649 --> 09:41.049
It's like a scene in that

09:41.050 --> 09:43.585
Steve Jobs movie.

09:43.586 --> 09:46.054
Uh, dead body. (chuckles)

09:46.055 --> 09:48.356
Wow, funerals are harder than I thought.

09:48.357 --> 09:50.292
I keep walking through
little pockets of cold,

09:50.293 --> 09:52.260
and I don't know what to think.

09:52.261 --> 09:55.964
You know, I think I might
just step back into the foyer.

09:55.965 --> 09:58.066
Well, well. "Foyer."

09:58.067 --> 09:59.567
You know,

09:59.568 --> 10:02.669
she acts like a cat in a
Fancy Feast commercial.

10:03.605 --> 10:07.008
I could maybe refer to
him as troublesome.

10:07.009 --> 10:08.476
That's true and that's not that bad.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.445
Joe, that is too negative.

10:10.446 --> 10:13.081
Try to think of a fun way to say that,

10:13.082 --> 10:16.584
like "an angel who walked amongst us."

10:16.585 --> 10:19.020
- Oh, that's good. Let me write that down.
- JERROD: No.

10:19.021 --> 10:20.989
No, no. How are those
at all the same thing?

10:20.990 --> 10:22.891
Dad, maybe you should focus on yourself

10:22.892 --> 10:24.859
instead of all those people out there.

10:24.860 --> 10:26.828
If Maxine is right and
funerals are for the living,

10:26.829 --> 10:28.797
then you need to say
what's really on your mind

10:28.798 --> 10:30.165
so you can get some closure.

10:30.166 --> 10:34.502
Joe, you can get closure alone,
in private.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.271
Or you can just let this

10:36.272 --> 10:38.907
manifest into prostate cancer.

10:38.908 --> 10:41.508
Because that is what prostate cancer is,

10:41.509 --> 10:45.211
a man's issues with his
father lookin' for an outlet.

10:47.615 --> 10:49.584
Why would you

10:49.585 --> 10:51.786
encourage your husband
to go out there and be fake?

10:51.787 --> 10:53.521
See, this is the problem
with funerals...

10:53.522 --> 10:55.156
everyone's concerned
with putting on a show.

10:55.157 --> 10:57.258
You know, half the people out
there aren't even really sad.

10:57.259 --> 10:58.460
They're just pretending to be

10:58.461 --> 10:59.627
because they think they're supposed to.

10:59.628 --> 11:01.129
BOBBY (groans): Oh, God.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.730
I'm barely holding it together, y'all.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.236
Can't believe Granddad is dead.

11:08.237 --> 11:12.374
I really wish I had my cane so
I'd have something to lean on.

11:12.375 --> 11:16.478
Case in point, Bobby
Carmichael, everybody.

11:16.479 --> 11:19.381
Thanks for the intro, Jerrod.

11:19.382 --> 11:23.451
It means a lot, especially
on a cloudy day like this.

11:23.452 --> 11:25.720
Hey, what's the best way
to say "irresponsible jerk

11:25.721 --> 11:28.356
who deserted his family"?

11:28.357 --> 11:31.792
"A free spirit who loves the outdoors."

11:33.228 --> 11:36.531
- Damn, girl! You are good at funerals.
- I know.

11:36.532 --> 11:37.999
Read us what else you got, Daddy.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.566
Okay. Well...

11:41.136 --> 11:43.505
Okay. (clears throat)

11:43.506 --> 11:44.773
(clears throat softly)

11:44.774 --> 11:48.443
"Dear ladies and gentlemen
at the funeral..."

11:48.444 --> 11:50.911
Not off to a strong start.

11:52.013 --> 11:54.916
"To die or not to die?

11:54.917 --> 11:57.952
"That is the question, and the answer...

11:57.953 --> 12:00.354
is a resounding yes, he is dead."

12:02.157 --> 12:04.125
"He drove a Chevy.

12:04.126 --> 12:06.094
Free spirit who liked the outdoors."

12:06.095 --> 12:07.561
How long was that?

12:09.931 --> 12:11.900
Uh, pardon the interruption.

12:11.901 --> 12:14.602
I just want to see if you
would care to view the body

12:14.603 --> 12:16.237
before we begin the service?

12:16.238 --> 12:18.373
Okay, let me consult
with my family first.

12:18.374 --> 12:20.507
Be right back.

12:21.876 --> 12:24.012
Hey, y'all, they want
to show us the body.

12:24.013 --> 12:25.480
Who's in?

12:25.481 --> 12:28.283
Well, I guess I am. Maybe
it'll inspire my speech.

12:28.284 --> 12:29.651
- Mama?
- When in Rome.

12:29.652 --> 12:31.719
- Jerrod?
- Eh.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.288
What is "eh"? What is that?

12:33.289 --> 12:36.191
- I mean, I'll see him if I see him.
- (groans)

12:36.192 --> 12:38.926
Look, you got three yeses and one "eh."

12:38.927 --> 12:40.793
Show us that body!

12:44.466 --> 12:47.100
I didn't know we'd be <i>opening</i> the box.

12:51.986 --> 12:55.174
Joe, does this inspire anything?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.676
Take a long, hard look at...

12:57.677 --> 13:00.012
this cold, lifeless body.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.516
That's your dad.

13:02.517 --> 13:05.652
You'll never, ever see him again.

13:05.653 --> 13:07.686
So lifeless,

13:07.687 --> 13:10.121
so... dead.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.693
Same place you'll be,

13:13.694 --> 13:16.196
same place we'll all be.

13:16.197 --> 13:20.834
Same... everybody you ever loved.

13:20.835 --> 13:23.303
Just dead.

13:23.304 --> 13:25.438
Dead. Dead.

13:25.439 --> 13:26.640
Dead!

13:26.641 --> 13:29.276
Okay, Ma, we get it.

13:29.277 --> 13:31.978
Well, Mama, you stirred
something up inside of me.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.680
(groans)

13:33.681 --> 13:38.051
Grandpa, since you've been gone
there's been a void in my life.

13:38.052 --> 13:41.121
Haven't been able to sleep.

13:41.122 --> 13:43.857
Haven't been able to eat.

13:43.858 --> 13:45.858
Well, not that much.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.031
- Jerrod, could you get a picture of me with Granddad?
- No.

13:51.032 --> 13:53.500
Come on, I'm hurting right now.
Just take the picture.

13:53.501 --> 13:55.468
- (scoffs) Fine, Bobby.
- Okay, wait.

13:55.469 --> 13:57.404
Get it ready. Wait, wait.

13:57.405 --> 13:59.705
(quiet, mock crying)

14:02.008 --> 14:03.677
Here.

14:03.678 --> 14:05.779
Wait. Ah. No. Come back.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.747
Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

14:07.748 --> 14:09.683
This is not a good one at all.

14:09.684 --> 14:10.750
We're not centered, okay?

14:10.751 --> 14:12.218
And we need Granddad's face in there.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.754
I am not perfecting a picture
of you and a corpse, Bobby.

14:14.755 --> 14:17.624
You are going to perfect a picture
of me and my grandfather.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.058
Here.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.395
(exhales)

14:22.396 --> 14:24.096
(sniffles)

14:27.400 --> 14:29.201
Got it. Yeah.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.603
Okay, this one is postable.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.309
- We're going to need to get started.
- Okay.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.577
I still got nothing.

14:37.578 --> 14:39.479
Oh. Cynthia, quick...
write down the lyrics

14:39.480 --> 14:42.215
- to "Candle in the Wind."
- Okay.

14:42.216 --> 14:44.951
Why don't I take a stab
at the eulogy, Dad?

14:44.952 --> 14:47.020
Here lies a man who took time

14:47.021 --> 14:48.989
for the important things in life:

14:48.990 --> 14:51.224
drinking...

14:51.225 --> 14:53.560
gambling... incessantly
cheating on his wife.

14:53.561 --> 14:55.295
Ma, you writing all this down?

14:55.296 --> 14:56.763
You better be careful, son.

14:56.764 --> 14:59.032
That's still your grandfather.
Be respectful.

14:59.033 --> 15:00.800
Well, I don't respect
the man in that box.

15:00.801 --> 15:02.569
And if we're being honest,
I don't respect you

15:02.570 --> 15:04.838
for never standing up to him.
I mean, you didn't do it

15:04.839 --> 15:06.773
when he was alive and
you're not doing it now.

15:06.774 --> 15:08.274
So what do you want me to do, Jarrod?

15:08.275 --> 15:09.576
You want me to tell the truth?

15:09.577 --> 15:11.411
- Yes.
- You want me to go out there

15:11.412 --> 15:14.147
in front of all those people and
tell the truth about my father?

15:14.148 --> 15:16.583
Yes, I do. I think
it'll be good for you.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.751
Okay, then where would
you want me to start?

15:18.752 --> 15:21.021
Wh-Why don't I just tell
them about the time

15:21.022 --> 15:24.324
he hit me so hard with a belt
you can still see the scars.

15:24.325 --> 15:26.626
Or about the time when
I was eight years old

15:26.627 --> 15:29.696
and I came home from school
and he was choking my mom...

15:29.697 --> 15:32.499
till the life almost
drained from her body.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.634
Or I could go up there
and I could tell them

15:34.635 --> 15:39.005
that to this day, I still feel
guilt for not being strong enough

15:39.006 --> 15:41.007
or brave enough to protect her.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.476
Is that what you want?

15:43.477 --> 15:44.978
Those are the stories you want to hear?

15:44.979 --> 15:47.480
- Joe, honey...
- I'm gonna need a minute.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.582
Look, Dad, I didn't know...

15:49.583 --> 15:51.717
I am gonna <i>need a minute.</i>

15:55.422 --> 15:57.891
All right, Joe...

15:57.892 --> 16:00.727
you take all the time you need.

16:00.728 --> 16:02.962
I, uh... I didn't know

16:02.963 --> 16:06.433
all of the words to...
"Candle in the Wind,"

16:06.434 --> 16:10.235
so in the middle I
switched to "Rocket Man."

16:27.454 --> 16:29.755
(quietly): Why'd you do it?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.791
Why did you hurt us?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.894
We were defenseless.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.898
(sighs)

16:38.899 --> 16:42.102
I really don't even know what to say.

16:42.103 --> 16:45.305
I guess I can blame it on
that Johnnie Walker Red.

16:45.306 --> 16:46.539
(knocking)

16:46.540 --> 16:49.175
I'm not done yet. I need a minute.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.709
Mom?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.246
(laughing softly): Hi, son.

16:53.247 --> 16:55.681
- (sighs heavily)
- Mm, mm.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.353
(exhales)

17:00.354 --> 17:02.855
You in here talking to a corpse?

17:04.958 --> 17:06.492
That ain't healthy, baby.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.261
Now, I didn't even know you'd be here.

17:08.262 --> 17:10.063
I thought you weren't
gonna show up for this.

17:10.064 --> 17:14.532
Well, I wasn't, but I wanted to
make sure the bastard was dead.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.636
Yep, you dead.

17:19.472 --> 17:23.443
I prayed that I'd live
long enough to see this day.

17:23.444 --> 17:26.045
Not so scary now, are you, William?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.347
(wry chuckle)

17:27.348 --> 17:29.348
How's my boy?

17:30.183 --> 17:31.818
I'm just trying to...

17:31.819 --> 17:34.019
piece this all together.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.057
I don't know why he
treated us the way he did.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.659
Well, it was the only thing he knew.

17:39.660 --> 17:43.062
And Johnnie Walker Red didn't help.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.965
I'm supposed to go out there
and give a... eulogy.

17:45.966 --> 17:49.002
I don't have any idea
what I'm gonna say.

17:49.003 --> 17:50.970
(sighs): I don't want to lie...

17:50.971 --> 17:53.239
erase what he did to us.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.208
I don't feel good about
saying horrible things

17:55.209 --> 17:57.177
about a man who's already dead, either.

17:57.178 --> 17:59.012
Just because I wasn't man enough

17:59.013 --> 18:01.548
to say it to him when
he was still alive.

18:01.549 --> 18:04.818
Well, baby, now, you can go
out there and curse his name

18:04.819 --> 18:07.320
or you can go out there
and sing his praises.

18:07.321 --> 18:09.322
Whichever one you choose

18:09.323 --> 18:13.026
is not gonna put an end to
your issues with your father.

18:13.027 --> 18:15.994
It's gonna take time
for you to do that.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.999
Mom...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.969
I'm sorry I didn't
stand up to him for you

18:22.970 --> 18:24.537
when I was a kid.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.372
Oh, baby, don't worry.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.941
I forgive you.

18:27.942 --> 18:29.275
Y-Yeah, but...

18:29.276 --> 18:33.478
you do realize I was a
child at the time, so...?

18:35.715 --> 18:38.750
Well, now, you could
have done something.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.955
Eight-year-olds are
stronger than you think.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.892
I'm not saying you would've won,

18:45.893 --> 18:49.529
but at least you could've
put forth some effort.

18:49.530 --> 18:52.398
Are you being serious right now, Mom?

18:52.399 --> 18:55.000
No, baby, I'm just messing with you.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.239
I've moved on. This doesn't
bother me anymore.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.175
- (exhales) - I've found peace,
and I hope you will, too.

19:02.176 --> 19:03.877
I just...

19:03.878 --> 19:06.279
I don't know what I'm gonna say.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.248
Well, just trust your heart.

19:08.249 --> 19:11.017
Well, I've been listening to my
heart and it hasn't said anything

19:11.018 --> 19:13.987
- about this man.
- I hear you.

19:13.988 --> 19:17.089
You want to get up out of here
and spend the day together?

19:17.090 --> 19:18.491
Lead the way, child.

19:18.492 --> 19:19.858
(laughs)

19:19.859 --> 19:21.794
We <i>are</i> going to drink, aren't we?

19:21.795 --> 19:23.796
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

19:23.797 --> 19:26.198
Good, 'cause I already started.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.579
(groans)

19:34.580 --> 19:36.881
Hey, Jerrod, I just threw up.

19:37.750 --> 19:38.984
Oh!

19:39.130 --> 19:40.296
Sorry.

19:47.171 --> 19:48.672
Jerrod?

19:48.673 --> 19:50.306
- Yeah?
- Oh.

19:52.544 --> 19:54.411
(exhales)

19:54.412 --> 19:57.047
Your family has strong genes.

19:59.817 --> 20:01.085
Hello, everybody.

20:01.086 --> 20:03.921
Unfortunately, I just found out

20:03.922 --> 20:06.157
there will be no eulogy.

20:06.158 --> 20:07.325
He's not gonna do it.

20:07.326 --> 20:09.727
But there will be a
musical performance!

20:09.728 --> 20:13.965
Okay. And now a musical performance

20:13.966 --> 20:17.178
by the daughter-in-law,
Cynthia Carmichael,

20:17.179 --> 20:19.565
- singing...?
- "Ave Maria."

20:19.914 --> 20:21.114
Hey, Maxine, watch this.

20:21.115 --> 20:23.283
