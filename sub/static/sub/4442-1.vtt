WEBVTT

00:00.161 --> 00:01.690
Do you remember that,

00:01.811 --> 00:03.363
when I used to help you paint?

00:03.414 --> 00:04.748
What the hell is going on?

00:04.814 --> 00:07.250
I would like to ask you
the same question.

00:07.317 --> 00:08.985
Just a drawing I did

00:09.053 --> 00:09.986
when I was a kid.

00:10.054 --> 00:11.721
Who's the dog?

00:11.789 --> 00:13.122
Sneakers.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.759
Not that dog.

00:15.826 --> 00:17.226
This dog.

00:17.294 --> 00:18.928
I-I-I don't know.

00:18.995 --> 00:20.363
Ryan, I'm only seven years old.

00:20.431 --> 00:21.597
This picture's at least 20.

00:21.665 --> 00:23.032
What aren't you telling me?

00:23.100 --> 00:24.500
You're no crazier
than anybody else.

00:24.568 --> 00:25.868
Said the dog to the man.

00:25.936 --> 00:28.003
If I really drew that picture
when I was a kid

00:28.072 --> 00:30.139
and you don't know
what it means,

00:30.207 --> 00:31.447
we're on a plane with no pilot.

00:31.475 --> 00:32.907
I drew the picture, Ryan.

00:32.975 --> 00:35.377
I was just messing with your
head like I usually do.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.591
Bear, look.

01:25.658 --> 01:29.194
There's a fresh can
of Febreze down there.

01:29.262 --> 01:32.030
What?! No, of course
I'm not gonna shove you

01:32.098 --> 01:33.265
down the stairs, Bear.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.400
I promised I wouldn't
do that again.

01:37.102 --> 01:38.536
Hey, Ryan, since Jenna and Drew

01:38.604 --> 01:39.837
are still on their honeymoon

01:39.904 --> 01:41.506
and Bear has a
fractured vertebra,

01:41.573 --> 01:42.940
I was thinking
"boys night out"?

01:43.008 --> 01:45.943
What say we head over
to Mr. Meyerson's

01:46.011 --> 01:49.647
and get all <i>Clockwork Orange</i>
on his rose bushes?

01:49.714 --> 01:52.516
Hey, what's going on down here?

02:02.092 --> 02:05.128
So you know about the drawing.

02:05.196 --> 02:07.264
For a couple weeks now.

02:07.331 --> 02:08.698
I'm sorry, mate.

02:08.765 --> 02:11.600
I shouldn't have lied to you
about drawing it.

02:11.669 --> 02:14.336
But you just seemed
so hopeless.

02:14.404 --> 02:16.139
It's okay, Wilfred.

02:16.206 --> 02:18.541
Because I think I've
figured it out.

02:18.608 --> 02:21.778
You see, at first, I couldn't
understand how you could be

02:21.845 --> 02:23.913
in that drawing
but still exist today.

02:23.981 --> 02:27.415
So I thought
maybe you've been reincarnated

02:27.483 --> 02:30.251
or maybe I had a premonition
when I was a kid

02:30.319 --> 02:32.154
that we'd meet someday.

02:32.221 --> 02:34.422
Then, hell, why not time travel?

02:34.490 --> 02:35.957
I was just grasping

02:36.025 --> 02:38.426
at these ridiculous theories
when I realized

02:38.494 --> 02:40.028
that the most logical
explanation

02:40.096 --> 02:42.963
has been right in front
of my eyes this whole time.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.867
Mental illness.

02:46.935 --> 02:48.435
Look...

02:48.503 --> 02:50.637
at-at certain points
in my life,

02:50.706 --> 02:53.107
I experienced emotional trauma:

02:53.175 --> 02:55.442
watching my parents fight,

02:55.510 --> 02:59.179
quitting my dad's law firm,
attempting suicide.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.280
And the way I dealt
with that trauma

03:01.348 --> 03:02.548
was by having these

03:02.616 --> 03:04.584
sort of psychological breaks
from reality.

03:04.651 --> 03:07.120
You think
I'm only in your head.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.255
Well, Jenna's dog is real.

03:09.323 --> 03:12.325
But... yes, I think
the part of you

03:12.392 --> 03:15.327
that no one else can
see is in my head.

03:15.394 --> 03:17.462
And you're happy about this?

03:17.530 --> 03:18.931
Well, yes.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.333
I mean, the first step
to me getting better

03:21.400 --> 03:23.501
is finally understanding
that-that this

03:23.569 --> 03:25.204
isn't actually happening.

03:25.271 --> 03:26.304
Look, Ryan,

03:26.372 --> 03:27.973
I wasn't gonna bring this up,

03:28.041 --> 03:32.009
but I've actually been doing
some thinking of my own.

03:32.077 --> 03:35.179
Wait, when did you...?

03:35.247 --> 03:37.982
See, I know for a fact
that I exist

03:38.050 --> 03:39.751
because I am, well, me.

03:39.818 --> 03:43.320
So I can't possibly
be just in your head.

03:43.388 --> 03:46.556
Therefore, the only
logical explanation

03:46.624 --> 03:49.993
is that I am a magical being.

03:50.061 --> 03:50.827
What?

03:50.895 --> 03:52.328
A wonderful magical being.

03:52.396 --> 03:53.630
I've been around forever,

03:53.697 --> 03:55.999
and I will always
be around forever.

03:56.067 --> 03:59.069
Okay, well, then how come when
you first found the drawing,

03:59.137 --> 04:01.070
you didn't remember meeting me
as a kid?

04:01.138 --> 04:04.240
Well, I don't remember
not remembering that, so...

04:04.307 --> 04:05.674
Well, you didn't.

04:05.742 --> 04:08.177
You said it right here
in this basement two weeks ago.

04:08.245 --> 04:10.946
Ryan, there's a lot of things
I don't remember. How can I...?

04:11.014 --> 04:12.648
Wait-- that's it!

04:12.715 --> 04:14.884
Dogs have terrible memories!
It makes perfect sense

04:14.951 --> 04:16.918
that I wouldn't remember
meeting you as a kid.

04:16.986 --> 04:19.053
Hell, there's probably
lots of people

04:19.120 --> 04:20.488
I don't remember meeting.

04:20.555 --> 04:23.091
The Ottomans,
ancient Greeks, troglodytes.

04:23.159 --> 04:26.161
Actually, no, I vaguely remember
the troglodytes.

04:26.228 --> 04:27.829
Overall a pretty nice bunch.

04:27.897 --> 04:29.831
I mean, sure,
some of them were dicks.

04:29.899 --> 04:32.200
Wilfred, you're not immortal.
That's completely illogical.

04:32.268 --> 04:34.101
If you finally figured out

04:34.169 --> 04:37.504
that I'm only in your head,
why am I still here?

04:37.571 --> 04:39.673
That's a good question.

04:41.342 --> 04:43.243
What are you doing?

04:43.311 --> 04:45.378
Wilfred isn't real.
Ryan, stop it.

04:45.446 --> 04:47.681
Wilfred is only in my head.
Don't say that.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.216
Wilfred is only in my head.

04:49.284 --> 04:50.249
Ryan, stop.

04:50.318 --> 04:51.518
Wilfred is only in my head.

04:51.585 --> 04:53.119
Please!

04:53.187 --> 04:56.155
Wilfred is only in my head.
Wilfred is only in...

05:07.200 --> 05:09.401
Ha ha!

05:09.469 --> 05:11.403
Oh, man, you should
see your face!

05:11.471 --> 05:12.438
You look like

05:12.505 --> 05:14.072
such a little bitch right now.

05:14.140 --> 05:18.043
You were all, like,
"Oh. He's only in my mind."

05:18.110 --> 05:19.511
You're an asshole.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.612
Look, maybe I'm magical,
maybe you're crazy.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.981
The answers will come
in good time.

05:24.049 --> 05:27.084
For now, you're just gonna
have to learn to live

05:27.152 --> 05:28.486
with a little uncertainty.

05:28.554 --> 05:29.987
I know what I'm doing.

05:30.055 --> 05:32.323
If you want to give up
so easily, be my guest.

05:32.391 --> 05:35.693
Okay. In that case,

05:35.761 --> 05:39.229
why don't we put
my little theory to a test?

05:40.331 --> 05:41.998
What's that?

05:42.066 --> 05:46.570
A little cocktail
I call antifreeze-tini.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.839
If I'm an immortal,
magical being,

05:48.906 --> 05:50.607
then this can't
possibly kill me.

05:50.675 --> 05:52.642
Bottoms up.

05:52.710 --> 05:55.478
Oops, almost forgot the olive.

06:00.684 --> 06:02.118
Wilfred, no!

06:04.488 --> 06:06.756
Well, I'm still here.

06:06.823 --> 06:08.958
I drank antifreeze
and didn't die

06:09.026 --> 06:11.426
on account of me
being magical and all.

06:11.494 --> 06:13.428
No, you got your
stomach pumped.

06:13.496 --> 06:14.629
I don't remember that.

06:14.697 --> 06:16.464
You don't remember screaming,

06:16.532 --> 06:18.267
"Okay, I'm not magical,
I'm not magical,"

06:18.334 --> 06:20.602
while the vet shoved a tube
down your throat?

06:20.669 --> 06:23.872
I do remember...
certain things from my past.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.407
Yes.

06:25.474 --> 06:27.275
It's coming back to me now.

06:27.342 --> 06:28.776
1945.

06:28.843 --> 06:32.013
My owner was
a little girl-- Anne.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.447
Anne Frank.

06:33.515 --> 06:34.481
Seriously, don't.

06:34.549 --> 06:35.749
Anne and her rules:

06:35.817 --> 06:38.585
no walks,
no trips to the groomer's.

06:38.653 --> 06:40.187
In the end, I just snapped.

06:40.255 --> 06:42.655
I screamed at her,
"Anne, I'm dying here!

06:42.723 --> 06:44.724
It's like we never leave
the house!"

06:44.792 --> 06:47.260
And thank God,
these well-dressed German men

06:47.328 --> 06:50.297
heard my barking
and-and broke into the attic.

06:50.364 --> 06:52.698
Those brave heroes rescued me.

06:54.402 --> 06:56.303
Well, it looks like

06:56.370 --> 06:58.437
Wilfred's blood ethylene
glycol levels have dropped.

06:58.504 --> 07:00.439
And by the way,
his microchip still lists

07:00.506 --> 07:01.473
an address up in Sacramento.

07:01.541 --> 07:03.809
Sacramento?
The state capital?

07:03.876 --> 07:05.978
Might want to update
his information.

07:08.481 --> 07:09.614
Whoever lives in Sacramento

07:09.682 --> 07:11.116
probably owned you as a puppy.

07:11.184 --> 07:13.218
Which means we can prove
you were actually born.

07:13.286 --> 07:14.419
Therefore, I'm crazy.

07:14.486 --> 07:15.586
If you really think
you're crazy,

07:15.654 --> 07:17.221
why the need to prove it to me?

07:17.289 --> 07:19.723
Maybe you're the part
of my brain that's so crazy

07:19.791 --> 07:21.540
it won't allow me to
accept that I'm crazy.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.294
God, you're so crazy.

07:23.362 --> 07:25.430
You remind me
of my old owner Vincent.

07:25.497 --> 07:26.464
Vincent?

07:26.531 --> 07:27.698
Fancied himself an artist.

07:27.766 --> 07:29.467
One day, he was at his easel,

07:29.534 --> 07:31.014
and he'd gotten
some paint on his ear.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.435
And I mistook it
for banana pudding,

07:32.470 --> 07:34.171
and so, obviously, I...

07:34.238 --> 07:37.007
Wilfred, you can't sit
on my lap right now.

07:37.075 --> 07:38.174
I'm driving.

07:38.241 --> 07:40.042
Which, to me, seems
like the perfect time

07:40.110 --> 07:43.312
to have your lap sat on.
I mean, am I crazy?

07:47.351 --> 07:48.885
And what happens
if my old owner

07:48.953 --> 07:50.753
wants me back?
I'd want me back.

07:50.821 --> 07:52.154
I mean, look at this shit.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.156
The statute of limitations
on lost pets is three years.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.025
Wait.

07:57.093 --> 07:59.427
I-I remember this.

07:59.496 --> 08:01.497
Right.
Like Anne Frank?

08:01.564 --> 08:02.731
This was my home.

08:02.799 --> 08:05.634
And this yard.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.403
I used to run around
this yard all day.

08:08.471 --> 08:09.904
God, I was so free here.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.839
And my toy.
My favorite toy.

08:11.907 --> 08:13.374
Good Green Hippo.

08:13.441 --> 08:17.011
He was little and green with
pink spots, and he was a hippo.

08:17.078 --> 08:19.881
And I bit off one of his legs.
He was fine with it.

08:19.948 --> 08:23.083
The last time I saw him,
I buried him...

08:23.151 --> 08:24.351
there.

08:31.592 --> 08:32.826
He's not here.

08:32.894 --> 08:34.828
Obviously.
You can't know something

08:34.895 --> 08:37.797
I don't already know
if you're only up here.

08:49.676 --> 08:51.577
See? How could I know that?

08:51.645 --> 08:54.647
Everybody knows that.

08:54.714 --> 08:56.448
Hi.

08:56.516 --> 08:57.916
My name's Ryan Newman.

08:57.983 --> 09:00.117
This is gonna sound crazy,

09:00.185 --> 09:02.419
but I think you maybe
used to own my dog.

09:02.539 --> 09:04.317
His name is Wilfred now, but...

09:08.126 --> 09:11.362
Who the hell's that fat,
ugly piece of shit?

09:17.457 --> 09:18.270
A clone?

09:18.454 --> 09:19.191
I know.

09:19.311 --> 09:20.665
When I first heard
about pet cloning,

09:20.733 --> 09:23.033
I was like, "Am I in
a science fiction movie?"

09:23.101 --> 09:25.402
My name is
Lord Charles Beevwelt II

09:25.470 --> 09:26.436
of Shropshire.

09:26.505 --> 09:27.605
Welcome to my home.

09:27.672 --> 09:29.640
Look around.
Do you like what you see?

09:29.708 --> 09:30.608
Actually, cloning isn't

09:30.675 --> 09:32.242
that uncommon anymore.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.613
Back in 2006, Stinky here
cost almost half a million.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.814
Stinky, huh?

09:36.882 --> 09:38.414
Just an affectionate nickname.

09:38.482 --> 09:40.583
Okay, there's no way
this guy is my clone.

09:40.651 --> 09:42.084
He looks nothing like me.

09:42.152 --> 09:43.987
Ooh, I love it.

09:44.054 --> 09:45.054
Such a jester.

09:45.122 --> 09:46.489
Can we keep him?

09:47.658 --> 09:48.925
Itch.

09:48.993 --> 09:50.627
So, you paid someone to do this?

09:50.694 --> 09:51.828
Oh, no, not me.

09:51.896 --> 09:53.129
I'm just Stinky's caretaker.

09:53.196 --> 09:54.630
I'm Heather Williger,
by the way.

09:54.697 --> 09:57.633
Hi. So you knew Wilfred
when he was a puppy?

09:57.700 --> 09:58.901
Oh, no.

09:58.968 --> 10:00.669
I only started
working here last year.

10:00.737 --> 10:01.603
Miss Covington

10:01.671 --> 10:03.672
was vacationing in Wisconsin

10:03.740 --> 10:04.940
when the first Stinky...

10:05.008 --> 10:06.074
um, uh, Wilfred...

10:06.142 --> 10:07.308
ran away.

10:07.376 --> 10:08.476
She decided she would do

10:08.545 --> 10:10.011
whatever it took
to bring him back.

10:10.078 --> 10:11.679
All right, that's enough.

10:11.747 --> 10:13.347
I said that's enough!

10:13.415 --> 10:16.651
Uh, would it be possible to
speak with Miss Covington?

10:16.718 --> 10:19.219
I'm sort of here for
a specific reason.

10:19.287 --> 10:21.388
I'm sorry,
she passed away last year.

10:21.456 --> 10:23.290
Oh.
She left everything

10:23.358 --> 10:24.525
in her will to the dog.

10:24.593 --> 10:26.860
I just get paid to live here,

10:26.928 --> 10:28.394
and, you know, make sure Stinky

10:28.462 --> 10:31.230
"maintains the lifestyle
he's grown accustomed to."

10:31.298 --> 10:33.867
What? He owns everything?

10:33.935 --> 10:35.334
That's right, Wilfred--
it's all mine.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.437
And I can do whatever
I please with it.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.907
It's like my life is one long
dalliance with pleasure.

10:40.975 --> 10:42.875
Dalliance?
That's not even a word.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.176
Is!

10:44.243 --> 10:45.410
Say, Wilfred,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.746
do you see this charming
little vase over here?

10:47.814 --> 10:49.381
Oh, Stinky, be careful.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.684
Its craftsmanship
is without equal.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.552
But how would I know that?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.454
I'm just a dog.

11:01.026 --> 11:02.426
Oh, Miss Williger?

11:02.494 --> 11:04.562
It seems there's a little
something left over

11:04.630 --> 11:06.097
from this morning's
bowel movement.

11:06.164 --> 11:08.032
Come and get it...

11:08.100 --> 11:09.667
if you can!

11:10.869 --> 11:12.837
I hate it when this happens.

11:19.410 --> 11:22.045
Damn, this guy really
lives the high life.

11:22.113 --> 11:23.113
Okay.
Oh!

11:23.180 --> 11:24.715
Sorry about that.

11:24.782 --> 11:27.117
So you were saying you're
here for a specific reason?

11:27.184 --> 11:29.385
I've owned Wilfred
for six years now.

11:29.453 --> 11:31.887
And I never got to see him
as a cute, little puppy.

11:31.955 --> 11:34.223
So I-I was just wondering
if maybe there's some photos

11:34.290 --> 11:35.658
lying around?
Oh, oh, shoot.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.126
Can you hold that thought?

11:37.193 --> 11:39.128
It's time for Stinky's
midday snack.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.564
Stinky is such a finicky eater.

11:42.633 --> 11:45.501
So I usually mix
chicken broth in.

11:45.568 --> 11:46.735
More broth.

11:46.802 --> 11:48.069
No, less broth.

11:48.137 --> 11:50.171
No, more broth!
You're doing it all wrong!

11:50.239 --> 11:51.806
This is bullshit.

11:51.874 --> 11:53.508
That clone stole my life.

11:53.575 --> 11:54.809
You're the one who ran away.

11:54.877 --> 11:56.277
I don't remember that.

11:56.345 --> 11:58.279
You know, your memory
seems pretty selective.

11:58.347 --> 12:00.849
Hopefully a puppy picture
will help refresh it.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.383
You won't find one, Ryan,
because I was never a puppy.

12:03.451 --> 12:05.052
Because I was never born.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.621
I have been eternally
dalliancing...

12:07.689 --> 12:09.422
That's not how
you use the word.

12:09.490 --> 12:10.357
Wilfred?

12:10.424 --> 12:11.925
Are you smelling this?

12:11.993 --> 12:13.460
It's a symphony of flavors--

12:13.528 --> 12:15.963
peas, carrots,
pork parts, bone meal

12:16.031 --> 12:18.230
and a delectable
sawdust filler.

12:18.298 --> 12:20.599
It's an old Covington
family recipe we call

12:20.668 --> 12:22.902
"Healthy Dog Chow Pro
with wet stuff on top."

12:22.970 --> 12:24.203
It's all I'll eat.

12:25.072 --> 12:26.172
That wet stuff on top

12:26.239 --> 12:27.373
should belong to me!

12:27.440 --> 12:29.275
All of this should belong to me!

12:29.342 --> 12:32.745
Hell, I bet that asshole's
got my Good Green Hippo, too.

12:32.813 --> 12:34.880
No, because it doesn't exist.

12:34.947 --> 12:36.247
Just like you and the clone.

12:36.315 --> 12:37.549
For the last time, Ryan,

12:37.616 --> 12:39.651
not only do I exist,
I am a magical being.

12:39.719 --> 12:41.586
And if I'd gotten
my rightful inheritance,

12:41.654 --> 12:44.156
I could've lived like a king
till the end of time.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.457
I'd be the dalliancer
of the world.

12:46.525 --> 12:49.027
Again, you're misusing
the word.

12:49.095 --> 12:50.494
Jesus!

12:50.562 --> 12:51.628
That's it.

12:51.697 --> 12:54.364
This Stinky character
has got to go.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.503
What's up, bitch? You want to do this?
How dare you enter my chambers

12:59.571 --> 13:01.471
without an invitation!
Let's do this! Come on, get some,

13:01.539 --> 13:02.606
you shit mound!
This skullduggery will not be tolerated!

13:02.674 --> 13:04.241
This is how we do it
in the hood!

13:04.309 --> 13:05.609
Wilfred, calm down.
Stinky, no.

13:05.677 --> 13:06.910
Wait.

13:06.977 --> 13:09.378
You like to scream hateful shit
at cuckoo birds, too?

13:09.446 --> 13:11.247
Of course. They burst
out of their homes

13:11.315 --> 13:12.448
and run off their mouths.

13:12.516 --> 13:14.317
And then when shit's
about to get real,

13:14.384 --> 13:16.853
they run back inside like
the little pussies they are.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.022
You like licking windows?

13:19.090 --> 13:20.556
Unsmeared windows bore me.

13:20.624 --> 13:23.525
I wonder, Wilfred,
do you enjoy doing this?

13:25.128 --> 13:27.462
It's cool. It's cool.

13:27.530 --> 13:29.998
We're not so different
after all, are we, Wilfred?

13:30.066 --> 13:31.433
Come.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.335
Swim with me in the seas
of opulence.

13:34.570 --> 13:37.472
Anyway, you wanted to see some

13:37.540 --> 13:39.240
old photos of Wilfred, right?

13:39.307 --> 13:40.908
Right.
Okay.

13:42.144 --> 13:44.278
What's mine is yours.

13:48.016 --> 13:50.651
I used to walk Stinky
when Miss Covington was alive,

13:50.719 --> 13:52.519
so I took some
of the later photos.

13:52.587 --> 13:55.188
Photography is kind of
a hobby of mine.

13:55.256 --> 13:57.323
When you watch a dog
all day, you just have

13:57.391 --> 13:59.993
to have some other outlets
for happiness, right?

14:02.029 --> 14:03.964
Right this way.

14:45.659 --> 14:46.627
Do you see this?

14:46.747 --> 14:47.648
Excuse me?

14:47.760 --> 14:48.927
Do you see this toy?

14:48.994 --> 14:50.362
I-I mean, describe it to me.

14:50.430 --> 14:52.163
What-what exactly do you see?

14:52.231 --> 14:54.131
Uh, I see a green hippopotamus.

14:54.199 --> 14:56.467
It has pink polka dots
and one leg

14:56.535 --> 14:58.168
that's been chewed off
or something.

14:58.236 --> 14:59.470
Where did you find it?

14:59.538 --> 15:01.205
W-Was it buried
in the yard or...?

15:01.272 --> 15:02.340
Is it real?

15:02.407 --> 15:04.074
Hold it.
Uh, n-no.

15:04.142 --> 15:05.209
I... uh, okay, you know what?

15:05.276 --> 15:06.644
I think you should leave now.

15:06.712 --> 15:08.545
You should get your dog and go.

15:14.418 --> 15:16.386
Oh, dear me.

15:16.454 --> 15:18.355
That is pure
as the driven snow.

15:18.422 --> 15:19.856
Wilfred, come.
We're leaving.

15:19.923 --> 15:23.226
Uh, I'm sort of in the middle
of something here, mate.

15:23.293 --> 15:24.393
I said come. Now.

15:24.461 --> 15:26.528
Dude, you are such a buzzkill.

15:26.596 --> 15:28.664
It's been such a delight.

15:28.732 --> 15:31.767
Come visit us again
sometime, won't you?

15:36.272 --> 15:38.306
I mean, you were
in that drawing.

15:38.375 --> 15:41.676
And the fact that
that hippo toy exists.

15:41.744 --> 15:44.612
Hell, maybe you are
a magical being.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.347
Look.

15:46.415 --> 15:47.715
Sorry to keep going over this.

15:47.783 --> 15:49.884
I just want to be
certain about it.

15:59.827 --> 16:03.630
Ryan, look, I found something
back at Stinky's house.

16:03.698 --> 16:05.499
I-I didn't want to show you,

16:05.566 --> 16:08.402
but I think it's too important
for you not to see.

16:09.704 --> 16:10.904
It's me.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.272
Right after I was born.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.840
Well, the real dog at least.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.442
Me, on the other hand,
who's talking to you,

16:16.510 --> 16:19.378
maybe I am just some kind
of manifestation

16:19.446 --> 16:21.046
of your madness.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.415
It doesn't make any sense.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.583
I found the hippo.
That means you're real.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.453
That's got to be
the clone, right?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.955
Or maybe you bought the hippo
on your way to Sacramento

16:31.023 --> 16:33.558
and tricked yourself
into thinking you uncovered it.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.328
Oh, God, I can't
take this anymore!

16:37.396 --> 16:39.163
What if you never
find any answers?

16:39.231 --> 16:40.398
Wouldn't it be best to avoid

16:40.466 --> 16:43.301
the anxiety
of uncertainty, and...

16:43.368 --> 16:45.903
simply skip to the end?

16:47.371 --> 16:49.239
What are you talking
about, Wilfred?

16:49.307 --> 16:52.709
I've thought this through, Ryan.
This is the only clear path.

16:52.777 --> 16:54.044
Think about it.

16:54.111 --> 16:56.513
The day we met was the day
of your failed suicide.

16:56.581 --> 16:59.282
Maybe I came
into your life for a reason.

16:59.350 --> 17:00.950
To show you that life

17:01.017 --> 17:03.953
is just a long,
torturous wrestling match

17:04.020 --> 17:06.055
with unanswerable questions.

17:06.122 --> 17:08.825
Maybe this is why I've existed
to you this whole time,

17:08.892 --> 17:13.162
to lead you back
to this final, fateful moment.

17:13.229 --> 17:14.464
There's no other way.

17:14.531 --> 17:16.932
Why are you doing
this, Wilfred?

17:16.999 --> 17:18.599
Ryan, drink up.

17:18.667 --> 17:22.170
Come on, one final dalliance
with death.

17:22.237 --> 17:24.705
Dalliance?

17:24.773 --> 17:26.907
Oh, my God--
you're Stinky.

17:26.976 --> 17:28.343
Oh, please don't harm me.

17:28.410 --> 17:29.610
What the hell is going on here?

17:29.645 --> 17:30.846
All right, all right.

17:30.913 --> 17:31.793
Uh, back at the house,

17:31.814 --> 17:34.381
Wilfred and I switched places.

17:34.449 --> 17:36.216
Why? Why would you
want to leave?

17:36.284 --> 17:37.818
You have no idea
what it's like back there.

17:37.886 --> 17:40.220
Miss Williger does sick,
humiliating things to me

17:40.288 --> 17:41.369
when no one else is around.

17:41.422 --> 17:42.723
I baited Wilfred
into the switch

17:42.791 --> 17:44.758
by making my life
seem like paradise.

17:44.826 --> 17:47.394
He told you about
my suicide attempt.

17:47.462 --> 17:49.028
We were doing cocaine, Ryan.

17:49.096 --> 17:52.365
A lot of personal stories were
shared in a rapid-fire manner.

17:52.432 --> 17:54.734
Why would you want
me to kill myself?

17:54.802 --> 17:56.369
Honestly, you were just
sitting there yammering

17:56.436 --> 17:58.204
on and on about
your inane problems.

17:58.271 --> 17:59.539
It was so boring.

17:59.607 --> 18:03.376
So much so that the idea
of watching you die seemed...

18:03.443 --> 18:05.143
I don't know... orgasmic?

18:05.211 --> 18:06.778
Wait a second.

18:06.846 --> 18:09.648
If Miss Williger abused you
when no one else was around...

18:14.286 --> 18:15.921
Wilfred!

18:15.989 --> 18:17.422
Oh, please, no.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.190
I don't like this.

18:19.258 --> 18:20.858
Wilfred!

18:20.926 --> 18:23.460
That's good. That's really good.

18:24.863 --> 18:27.965
I love that. Come on.
Move your little feet around.

18:28.033 --> 18:30.167
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.837
Ryan, you came back for me.

18:34.506 --> 18:37.145
Oh. I-I'm sorry.
Th-There's been a mix-up.

18:37.265 --> 18:39.685
I accidentally took Stinky
with me instead of Wilfred.

18:39.805 --> 18:41.578
You. You tricked me.

18:41.646 --> 18:43.179
Was I tricking you
when you were snout-deep

18:43.247 --> 18:46.416
in giraffe vagina with a gram
of cocaine up your rectum?

18:46.483 --> 18:48.484
There's only one way
to settle this.

18:48.553 --> 18:51.287
Rape fight.
Rape fight.

18:51.355 --> 18:53.556
I'll be in the car.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.030
So, who won the rape fight?

19:01.150 --> 19:04.713
Just drive, please.

19:28.817 --> 19:30.484
Wilfred!

19:34.956 --> 19:37.491
The answers will come
in good time.

20:10.589 --> 20:12.089
What the hell?!

20:12.157 --> 20:14.192
Oh, I thought that's what
we were doing now.

20:15.118 --> 20:17.362
Jesus.
