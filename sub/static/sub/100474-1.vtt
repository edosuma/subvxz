WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.470
(soft soothing music)

00:08.309 --> 00:11.443
(muffled crosstalk)

00:18.619 --> 00:21.553
(birds chirping)

00:32.199 --> 00:33.565
- At the dawn of time,

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
the roles of men and
women were well-defined.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.171
(tribal drum music)

00:39.173 --> 00:42.141
(hawk screeching)

00:44.712 --> 00:46.779
He who lived an
adventurous life,

00:46.781 --> 00:49.314
hunting, foraging and providing,

00:50.484 --> 00:52.584
while she stayed in the
security of their cave dwelling

00:52.586 --> 00:54.553
and made what little
they had at home.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.326
But over millions of years,
something strange happened:

01:01.328 --> 01:03.712
the lines blurred.

01:03.713 --> 01:06.097
Call it evolution or
straight up confusion,

01:06.100 --> 01:10.335
but the modern relationship
is so complicated.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.672
Just like every other
couple throughout history,

01:13.674 --> 01:15.340
we had plenty of our own issues.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.476
While most people
plan a date night,

01:17.478 --> 01:20.179
see a therapist or
secretly take out

01:20.181 --> 01:21.847
their frustrations during sex,

01:21.849 --> 01:24.583
we needed something
much more intense.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.285
We needed an intervention.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.222
I guess we should
start at the beginning.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.459
When Pam and I first met,
like every other guy,

01:33.461 --> 01:35.461
I was just trying to
scratch out a living.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.862
(soothing bongo music)

01:36.864 --> 01:40.299
What about Venice?
- Nah, too cliche.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.733
- Yeah.

01:41.735 --> 01:42.701
Tokyo?

01:42.703 --> 01:47.106
- You know, I don't think
Francesca eats sushi.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.373
- Yeah well, we
can't just take 'em

01:48.375 --> 01:49.541
to New York for
dinner this month.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.509
That's amateur.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.245
- I don't know,
they're Black Ops.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.847
Their standards are pretty high.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.616
- Well I'll think of somethin'.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.684
- Yeah.

01:58.686 --> 02:02.221
(soft intriguing music)

02:09.597 --> 02:11.296
- What about Paris?

02:11.298 --> 02:12.709
(jet pack whooshing)

02:12.710 --> 02:14.121
- Well with everything
goin' on there,

02:14.122 --> 02:15.533
I don't wanna feel
like I'm on-call.

02:15.536 --> 02:19.371
(soft intriguing music)

02:19.373 --> 02:22.541
(jet pack whooshing)

02:24.245 --> 02:25.961
- Nah, you're right.

02:25.962 --> 02:27.678
I'll think of somethin'
a little more exotic

02:29.783 --> 02:30.782
off the grid.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.585
(jet pack thudding)

02:33.587 --> 02:36.889
You didn't see that or this.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.491
(jet pack exploding)

02:39.493 --> 02:40.859
I've got it.
- What?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.194
- [Corey] Kathmandu.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.631
- Kathman-fucking-du, yes!

02:45.633 --> 02:47.199
- The girls are gonna love
the little restaurants

02:47.201 --> 02:48.767
and dive bars in the Himalayas.

02:49.937 --> 02:53.505
(soft intriguing music)

02:54.441 --> 02:56.575
(bullet pinging)
(man wincing)

02:56.577 --> 02:59.311
The important thing is
what happens in Kathmandu,

02:59.313 --> 03:00.646
stays in Kathmandu.

03:02.650 --> 03:06.685
(muffled whispering)
(radar beeping)

03:06.687 --> 03:08.320
- I've got our target,

03:08.322 --> 03:09.388
Egan Doyle.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.624
We don't know what
kind of weapon

03:11.625 --> 03:13.859
he's trying to
acquire or from whom.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.329
He's moving quickly
through the concourse.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.632
(intriguing orchestral music)

03:20.634 --> 03:23.502
(radar beeping)

03:32.947 --> 03:34.479
- I'm so sorry, are you okay?

03:34.481 --> 03:35.948
- [Pam] No no, I'm not okay.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.750
- What?

03:39.620 --> 03:42.888
(soft romantic music)

03:44.291 --> 03:45.390
- That really fucking hurt.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.252
(radar beeping)

03:51.253 --> 03:52.908
- Corey, (taps) what's goin' on?

03:52.909 --> 03:54.564
- I just don't know what
would make you in such a rush.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.867
You don't have to be running
recklessly through a mall

03:55.869 --> 03:57.903
without looking
where you're going.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.349
I mean it was rude

03:59.350 --> 04:00.794
and I've just gotten
to a point in my life

04:00.795 --> 04:02.239
where I'm gonna be one of
these people that speaks up,

04:02.243 --> 04:03.742
so this is me speaking up.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.278
And I'm just curious what
you might have to say

04:06.280 --> 04:07.579
other than you're sorry

04:07.580 --> 04:08.879
because you've already
fucking said that.

04:10.951 --> 04:14.553
(soft orchestral music)

04:15.489 --> 04:16.788
- I don't know.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.526
- Sorry, I overstepped.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.497
Here I am giving lectures
when I should just be

04:25.499 --> 04:27.566
I'm handing out free samples.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.568
- What the hell are
you doin', Corey?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.871
Go get Egan.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.173
- It's all about
customer appreciation

04:34.174 --> 04:36.475
and I want you to know
that I appreciate you.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.278
- I feel appreciated.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.848
- Whoa, your hands.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.717
They're like sandpaper.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.588
What, are you in
construction or something?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.689
- What the?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.559
- No, I'm not in construction.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.562
I work in cardboard,
sell cardboard boxes.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.035
- Right well if you want,

05:03.037 --> 05:04.670
you can join our
membership club.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.805
We can send you, you
know information,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.006
specials and coupons.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.742
I just need your email.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.978
- Yeah, join the club.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.015
- Great.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.655
- I'm Corey.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.656
- I'm Pam.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.960
(soft romantic music)

05:28.962 --> 05:30.729
- Corey.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.364
Is this thing even working?

05:32.366 --> 05:33.365
Corey.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.835
Corey, Corey!

05:36.837 --> 05:37.703
(earpiece screeching)

05:37.704 --> 05:38.570
- Shit, I'm sorry.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.604
I have to go.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.006
- Is everything okay?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.007
- Just a business meeting.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.475
- What about your email?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.877
- [Corey] Don't
worry, I'll find you.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.681
(intense intriguing music)

05:52.820 --> 05:54.019
- Fuck, shit.

05:54.955 --> 05:55.954
We lost Egan.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.358
We lost Egan.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.094
What the fuck?

06:04.665 --> 06:09.801
(soft orchestral music)
(hawk screeching)

06:11.772 --> 06:14.673
- Jeez, thought it was a bug.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.513
Don't freak out, Corey's
gonna be here any minute.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.452
- So you're looking
at Havenshire County's

06:27.454 --> 06:29.755
year five figure
skating champion.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.725
- Wow, you're really good.

06:34.795 --> 06:39.931
(skates swishing)
(soft romantic music)

06:41.068 --> 06:42.067
- Oh my god.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.537
Were you in the
Olympics or something?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.572
- Just a little ice
hockey growin' up.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.443
- I knew it.
- What?

06:51.445 --> 06:52.511
- You're gonna be
one of those guys

06:52.513 --> 06:54.013
who's good at everything.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.514
- What's wrong with
being good at everything?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.616
- Knowing you're
good at everything,

06:57.618 --> 06:59.885
nothing will ever
make you happy.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.853
- That's not true.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.820
I'm totally happy.
- Are you?

07:01.822 --> 07:02.854
- Yeah, I am.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.426
- You wanna know what I think?

07:07.428 --> 07:09.161
I think you're one of those guys

07:09.162 --> 07:10.895
who's always gonna be
looking up at the clouds

07:10.898 --> 07:13.465
tryin' to figure
out the next dream,

07:13.467 --> 07:15.834
the next accomplishment
trying to see

07:15.836 --> 07:18.904
every little part of the
world and how to escape to it

07:18.906 --> 07:21.740
all so you don't have
to look in the mirror

07:21.742 --> 07:23.575
and find out who you really are.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.080
- Where's the adventure
in that, my dear?

07:30.517 --> 07:33.852
- The adventure is finding
out what's really inside.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.242
- It's still kinda early.

07:40.243 --> 07:41.726
What do you feel like doin'?

07:41.728 --> 07:44.863
- No, it's your turn.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.966
You can't expect me to
come up with everything.

07:48.735 --> 07:49.901
- All right, well we can hop

07:49.903 --> 07:51.736
a jet to New York, catch a play.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.707
Jump on a yacht to Tahiti.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.159
- Yeah.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.610
- Or we can head to
Kenya for a safari.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.146
- Your head, it's in the clouds.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.849
For a guy who sells
cardboard boxes for a living,

08:03.851 --> 08:06.551
you have quite the imagination.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.788
- Yeah, I guess I do.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.625
(Soft romantic music)

08:13.627 --> 08:15.894
- Look, I've gotta get
up early in the morning

08:15.896 --> 08:18.897
to open the store, so I think
we should call it a night.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.967
- Yeah.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.902
Yeah, we'll call it a rain
check on our next adventure.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.855
(Corey sighing)

08:31.856 --> 08:33.534
- Look, I hope I didn't
freak you out earlier

08:33.535 --> 08:35.213
with my whole anti-thrill
seeking diagnosis.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.018
- There's something about you.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.656
There's a word for it.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.258
You're just--
- Oh god, no.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.793
No, look I've been
on way too many dates

08:48.795 --> 08:50.095
where people pretend.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.563
You know, they're
not themselves.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.814
It's not me.

08:52.815 --> 08:54.064
What you see is what you get.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.090
- No, I get it.

08:56.091 --> 08:57.313
I'd much rather have
you be real than--

08:57.314 --> 08:58.536
- Present something I'm not?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.073
- Right, yeah.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.579
- I guess if you do
wanna come over, you can.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.947
But I'm gonna be
watching a movie

09:08.949 --> 09:11.049
and I have laundry,
like a lot of laundry.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.651
Stacks of it, in fact.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.586
- Love to do laundry
and watch a movie.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.691
(soft romantic music)

09:21.094 --> 09:24.095
- Great.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.096
- Great.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.235
(muffled TV speech)

09:42.649 --> 09:44.716
- Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.817
You?

09:45.819 --> 09:46.818
- Yeah.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.655
(whimsical music)

09:50.657 --> 09:55.360
(gun blasting)
(program whirring)

09:55.362 --> 09:56.628
- Fuck!
- What the hell

09:56.630 --> 09:57.696
is wrong with you?

09:57.697 --> 09:58.763
You're messin' me up.

09:58.764 --> 09:59.830
- Coffee.
- You never miss.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.416
- Yeah well, it must be the gun.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.000
- You know ever since we
failed that Egan mission,

10:03.003 --> 10:05.137
you haven't been the same.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.272
- All right Smuts, I failed
one fuckin' mission one time.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.240
It's bound to happen
sooner or later, 'kay?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.242
- Well it wouldn't have happened

10:11.243 --> 10:13.243
if you weren't off
flirting with Pat.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.046
- It's Pam.
- Whatever.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.984
Just tell me you're not
gettin' serious with this girl.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.253
- Trust me.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.754
Pam and I, we're
just havin' fun.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.189
There's nothin'
serious about it.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.557
- [Commentator]
45 seconds to play

10:25.558 --> 10:26.924
in the sudden death overtime.

10:26.927 --> 10:32.063
(chips crunching)
(soft romantic music)

10:34.167 --> 10:35.533
- [Pam] Who would you do

10:35.534 --> 10:36.900
if you could be someone
completely different?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.737
- What do you mean?

10:38.739 --> 10:41.172
- Don't you ever think about
making some drastic change?

10:41.174 --> 10:43.274
You know, taking
some risk and chance

10:43.276 --> 10:45.343
just to be something else.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.680
- Oh yeah, sure.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.848
I mean why not buy a
three-bedroom house

10:49.850 --> 10:51.784
and sell boxes from one place

10:51.785 --> 10:53.719
rather than chase corporate
accounts all over the world?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.654
- No no no no, you have
to be something else.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.657
I mean like for me, I've
always always always

10:59.660 --> 11:01.159
wanted to have my makeup line.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.095
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.131
I mean I can see the
packaging field the products.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.599
I once even worked
for the chemists

11:07.600 --> 11:09.066
in developing this
firming cream.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.336
- Firming cream, what
is firming cream?

11:11.338 --> 11:14.205
- Oh you don't have to worry
about it, you don't need it

11:15.676 --> 11:16.908
yet.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.044
- (chuckles softly) All right.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.413
So if you got it over
here, why not do it now?

11:21.415 --> 11:23.715
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.785
- So says the
cardboard box salesman.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.186
Why don't you just
change your career

11:28.188 --> 11:30.121
and become what
you're dying to be?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.824
- How do you know I won't?

11:35.696 --> 11:37.328
- Well, I know.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.365
I mean as much as I see myself
commanding a makeup empire,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.801
I don't wanna sacrifice
everything I have now.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.836
I think it'd be easier
climbing Mount Everest.

11:44.838 --> 11:45.804
- (chuckles softly) I
don't know 'bout that.

11:45.805 --> 11:46.771
It's pretty difficult.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.107
I'd imagine.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.275
Although, the Napelese

11:51.244 --> 11:52.811
food is pretty good I hear.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.148
- So how long have
you been thinking

11:57.149 --> 11:58.982
about that three-bedroom house
with the white picket fence?

12:01.755 --> 12:02.987
- Ever since I met you.

12:07.994 --> 12:08.993
- Yeah?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.362
I sort of had a similar thought.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.731
- You did?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.099
- Yeah, like this morning.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.467
I was at Target and I
saw this dinnerware set

12:15.469 --> 12:18.737
and I just suddenly thought
these would be perfect

12:19.272 --> 12:20.739
for our dinner parties.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.509
- You want dinner parties?

12:24.511 --> 12:25.510
- Corey,

12:29.883 --> 12:33.384
we're gonna have a
lot of dinner parties.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.375
(romantic jazz music)

13:02.082 --> 13:03.248
- [Man] There you go.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.718
- Is that all?

13:06.719 --> 13:08.386
- Is that gonna make me young
enough to make you the cougar?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.789
- (chuckles softly) Yeah, well

13:10.791 --> 13:12.791
they do come highly recommended.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.025
- You ever seen one of these?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.560
They take ya all over the world.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.094
You could ride the Harry
train with me there.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.563
- Okay, maybe one day.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.030
- Don't take me off
your boyfriend list.

13:20.031 --> 13:21.497
- (chuckles softly) I won't.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.268
- Cheers.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.036
- Have a great day.
- See ya soon.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.804
- Bye, thank you
so much. (chuckles)

13:28.041 --> 13:32.043
I don't have a gag reflex
in case you were wondering.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.815
- Here we go.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.584
- You are a moron.
- Mm-hmm, why?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.352
- 'Cause he had a
frickin' black card.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.455
- So?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.557
- So that card is an
insurance policy, Pam.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.292
That card says you
never have to work

13:47.294 --> 13:49.093
at this shitty job ever again.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.829
That card says sorry, Brianna.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.597
I can't make it to
your birthday party

13:52.598 --> 13:54.364
because my husband and I are
vacationing in the Swiss Alps

13:54.367 --> 13:56.234
and then we're going
to our Italian villa

13:56.236 --> 13:57.969
where we're gonna be
waited on hand-and-foot

13:57.971 --> 14:00.004
by bronze-chested man servants.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.506
- Brianna, you know
I'm in a relationship.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.075
- (scoffs) Corey
sells boxes, Pam.

14:04.077 --> 14:04.843
Okay?

14:04.844 --> 14:05.610
I mean is he cute?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.522
Yeah.

14:06.523 --> 14:07.433
Does his ass look good
in a pair of jeans?

14:07.434 --> 14:08.344
Sure.

14:08.345 --> 14:09.255
Does he have a good personality?

14:09.256 --> 14:10.166
Why not?

14:10.167 --> 14:11.077
But at the end of the day,

14:11.084 --> 14:14.352
he sells cardboard
fucking boxes, Pam.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.420
Do you know how boring that is?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.121
- It's not boring.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.823
Is he James Bond?

14:18.824 --> 14:20.524
No, but like I don't
want a James Bond.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.527
- Well good 'cause
you got James Bland.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.262
- I just want someone
I can depend on.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.498
Someone that is stable,
like-minded, consistent.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.284
- Well you shoulda told me
you were looking for that

14:29.285 --> 14:31.069
'cause I woulda hooked you
up with my grandfather.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.136
- Okay.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.072
(Brianna gagging)

14:34.074 --> 14:35.490
Okay.

14:35.491 --> 14:36.907
What does he do, eat
your pussy really good?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.543
I don't know, I don't get it.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.245
I can't answer that question.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.180
- [Smuts] You just
quit, what the hell?

14:42.182 --> 14:45.083
- This whole spy life isn't
what I want anymore, Smuts.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.252
You said it yourself,
I haven't been the same

14:47.254 --> 14:48.653
since I failed
that last mission.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.021
It's 'cause I'm not.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.056
- (scoffs) God.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.542
(door buzzing)

14:54.543 --> 14:57.027
Please don't start with that
romantic dribble about Pat.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.298
- It's Pam.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.366
And yes she's what I care
about, Smuts all right?

15:02.369 --> 15:03.969
I love her.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.570
I'm ready to live
that normal life

15:05.571 --> 15:07.171
that we've always
been protecting.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.306
(machine whirring)

15:08.308 --> 15:09.307
- Really?

15:10.143 --> 15:12.110
Wow, okay.

15:12.112 --> 15:16.047
So you're telling me that
you can't wait to go out,

15:16.049 --> 15:19.417
assume your cover,
sell cardboard boxes

15:19.419 --> 15:22.453
be chained to a desk,
join a bowling league,

15:22.455 --> 15:25.123
start paying taxes,
get a mortgage,

15:25.125 --> 15:27.258
have a car payment,
fly commercial,

15:27.260 --> 15:29.327
start swimming in
credit card debt?

15:29.329 --> 15:32.463
I mean (chuckles) what are
you gonna tell me next,

15:32.465 --> 15:36.100
that ya like drinking
domestic beer?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.204
- I love domestic beer.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.973
(machine whirring)

15:41.975 --> 15:44.709
(soft soothing music)

15:44.711 --> 15:47.645
(birds chirping)

15:51.017 --> 15:56.154
- Done.
(soft romantic music)

15:56.623 --> 15:59.023
(ceiling crumbling)

15:59.025 --> 16:02.460
(gasps) Holy, it's a
bit of a fixer-upper.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.462
- Yeah, but it's ours.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.415
(lips smacking)

16:07.416 --> 16:09.299
Well our boxes are made
of 100% recycled material.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.069
No, I can't give you a discount.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.404
What I can do is enroll you

16:12.405 --> 16:13.738
in our customer
appreciation program

16:13.740 --> 16:16.074
which does offer
rewards on both orders.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.788
Well I'm sorry to
hear that, sir.

16:18.789 --> 16:20.500
But if you happen
to change your mind,

16:20.501 --> 16:22.212
don't hesitate to call back
and ask for cardboard Corey.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.081
(net clacking)

16:23.083 --> 16:24.482
Ooh.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.750
(soft soothing music)

16:25.752 --> 16:27.919
- Welcome to the team.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.087
- Well let's knock 'em down
and knock 'em back, huh?

16:31.224 --> 16:33.591
Honey, I'm home.
- Taste this.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.094
- Mmm, that's good; what is it?

16:36.096 --> 16:37.746
- Nepalese Momo.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.397
I found them in this amazing
cookbook that I picked up

16:39.399 --> 16:40.899
this week and I
couldn't find the Jimbu,

16:40.900 --> 16:42.400
but I think this'll
taste all right.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.846
- A what?

16:43.847 --> 16:45.291
- It's a Nepalese dried onion.

16:45.292 --> 16:46.736
I'm testin' for
our dinner party.

16:46.740 --> 16:47.672
- What dinner party?

16:47.674 --> 16:48.673
- Corey.
- What?

16:48.675 --> 16:53.244
- We're gonna have a
lot of dinner parties.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.581
(soft romantic music)

16:56.583 --> 16:59.684
- God, I hope it stays
like this forever.

16:59.686 --> 17:04.756
(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

17:07.027 --> 17:10.028
And for the cave people, it
did stay like that forever.

17:11.731 --> 17:16.467
But unfortunately, well
we ain't livin' in a cave.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.571
(ceiling crumbling)
(Corey gasping)

17:20.573 --> 17:22.340
I thought you were gonna
call and have that fixed.

17:22.342 --> 17:27.478
- I thought you were gonna
call and have that fixed.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.449
(Pam sighing)
(dog barking)

17:31.451 --> 17:33.518
(Corey grunting)
(ceiling tile clanking)

17:33.520 --> 17:36.287
- No, we don't have
any plastic bins.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.239
We don't have any
metal containers.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.190
We don't sell steel
drums, just boxes.

17:40.193 --> 17:44.595
Plain old fucking
cardboard boxes. (sighs)

17:45.632 --> 17:48.199
- [Rick] It's all
about personality.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.235
(lights buzzing)
(clock ticking)

17:51.237 --> 17:52.603
It's all about passion.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.175
It's all about
believing what you sell.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.613
- Look I don't know what you
want me to do here, Rick.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.682
All right?

18:04.683 --> 18:06.750
I watched the training video,
I followed the sales manual.

18:06.751 --> 18:08.818
At the end of the day, I
mean they're just boxes.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.156
- No, Corey.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.227
They're not just boxes.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.263
These are containers that move
the treasures of our lives.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.367
- (sighs) Right, okay.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.369
- Remember our motto,

18:28.374 --> 18:29.874
"Think outside the box."

18:32.312 --> 18:35.546
(soft swing music)

18:35.548 --> 18:36.497
- Hey, Freddy.

18:36.498 --> 18:37.447
(claps) C'mon baby, let's go.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.360
You got this.

18:38.361 --> 18:39.271
Four pins, that's all we need.

18:39.272 --> 18:40.182
C'mon.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.489
(bowling pin clacking)

18:44.491 --> 18:45.456
- Loser!
- Woo!

18:53.766 --> 18:56.300
- Hey, what the fuck?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.802
First we lose to Polly's Pies,

18:57.804 --> 19:00.304
then Tim's Auto Body
and now Diana's Floral?

19:00.874 --> 19:01.706
I mean what is this?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.691
I don't get it.

19:03.692 --> 19:05.675
Do you even realize that
we are the laughing stock

19:05.678 --> 19:06.844
of this league?

19:06.846 --> 19:10.148
Every time you throw a
gutter or miss a spare,

19:10.150 --> 19:12.517
you guys just laugh if
off and it's not funny.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.286
I mean I've tried to
help you guys, right?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.188
I mean Ted, I bought
you finger grips.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.456
Where the hell they at?

19:19.592 --> 19:22.160
Fred, I bought you lessons.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.678
Bob.

19:23.679 --> 19:25.195
Bob you know if
anybody was on my side,

19:25.198 --> 19:27.315
I thought it'd be you.

19:27.316 --> 19:29.433
I bought you a wrist guard
and you don't even wear it.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.439
- Well why don't you quit?
- No.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.275
Winners don't quit, Ted.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.910
Winners win.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.544
- I honestly don't give
a shit about winning.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.230
- Yeah, man.

19:42.231 --> 19:43.914
Do you know how much shit I
have to deal with at home?

19:43.917 --> 19:46.250
I don't need extra pressure,
I don't want stress.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.886
I come here to drink beers
and catch up with my guys.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.890
- Hey, I forgot
to tell you guys.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.792
My dual hood grill
just showed up.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.594
It's incredible.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.599
- Oh man, I am so
jealous right now.

20:02.869 --> 20:06.871
(foreboding intriguing music)

20:08.508 --> 20:11.509
(camera clicking)

20:11.510 --> 20:14.511
(soft swing music)
(singers vocalizing)

20:30.630 --> 20:32.763
- I'm kinda tired.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.366
- Yeah, I'm kinda tired too.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.468
Maybe tomorrow.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.371
- Definitely tomorrow.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.908
(Corey sighing)

20:43.910 --> 20:45.676
- Wow, you were totally right.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.012
This definitely
beats happy hour.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.880
You know serial killers
hang out here, right?

20:49.882 --> 20:51.582
- Okay look, you
didn't have to come.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.784
I told you I had to
get the track lighting.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.454
- Listen to yourself.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.722
You've been on like
this Joan of Arc,

20:57.723 --> 20:58.989
mother of misery
routine for a week.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.792
- Here we go.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.593
- I'm just saying I get
why you're depressed.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.394
You get up, go to
work, you come home.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.964
You watch "Dance
Mom" for 12 hours,

21:06.966 --> 21:08.933
then you pass out and
do it all over again.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.802
It's enough to make
anybody miserable.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.670
- If I lied to you and
told you I was miserable,

21:12.672 --> 21:13.725
would that make you stop?

21:13.726 --> 21:14.779
- I don't want you
to be miserable.

21:14.780 --> 21:15.833
I just want you to be that Pam

21:15.834 --> 21:16.887
that I used to know, you know?

21:16.888 --> 21:17.941
The Pam who was like it's
four p.m., who cares?

21:17.944 --> 21:21.445
Let's go get drunk or let's
go on a crazy shopping spree

21:21.447 --> 21:23.547
even though we both have no
money in our bank accounts.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.651
The Pam that just had
that like joie de vivre.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.853
- Brianna, I am happy.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.088
Look, you just don't understand

21:30.089 --> 21:31.322
what it's like to be
in a relationship.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.508
There's a lot going on.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.693
Corey and I've gotta you know
finish stuff with the house.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.562
We're decorating rooms,
refinishing hardwood,

21:38.564 --> 21:40.298
installing track lighting.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.501
It's a lot.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.502
You know, there's just not
enough time for joie de vivre.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.605
- Okay, well we better make
some time for margaritas

21:47.607 --> 21:49.307
'cause this bitch is craving.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.308
- Okay.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.993
- (scoffs) I wish you
would've married James Bond

21:51.994 --> 21:53.677
instead of James Bland.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.645
- James Bond?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.814
James Bond, really?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.982
'Cause he was an emotionally
unstable womanizing alcoholic.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.718
- Yeah, but that's kinda hot.

22:01.554 --> 22:05.089
- Wow, this place is amazing.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.658
How come we've never
hung out here before?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.360
- You're not funny.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.184
- You're wrong.

22:11.185 --> 22:13.007
You see I'm Rodney
fuckin' Dangerfield, man.

22:13.008 --> 22:14.830
I'm tellin' you comedy
is tragedy and this place

22:15.735 --> 22:17.301
is fucking depressing.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.868
- I warned you I had to pick
up a light package, right?

22:18.871 --> 22:20.271
You knew what you
were gettin' into.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.672
- Yeah, you warned me all right

22:21.674 --> 22:24.408
and all this really excites you.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.877
- Yes, this really excites me.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.881
- Damn, you need a vacation.

22:30.883 --> 22:31.882
- What?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.618
- A vacation.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.353
A place you can
swim with dolphins,

22:35.355 --> 22:39.390
squirrel suit off a cliff,
hovercraft over a lake.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.360
I don't know, just
anything to feel your mojo

22:42.362 --> 22:47.498
that's so obviously
been neutered by this
suburban insanity.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.368
- Yeah well, I'd love to go
to some tropical destination

22:50.370 --> 22:52.503
with warm sunshine and
cold drinks, Smuts.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.971
But what problems
does that solve?

22:53.973 --> 22:57.074
(cellphone buzzing)

22:58.945 --> 23:00.962
Hello.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.980
(whimsical music)

23:02.982 --> 23:04.415
What the hell, I'm here now.

23:05.818 --> 23:06.951
Well why would you
have me come here

23:06.953 --> 23:08.953
if you were gonna get it?

23:10.990 --> 23:12.056
(sighs) Okay.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.528
- (whistles) You really
do have a lotta problems.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.497
- Spy means nothin'.

23:19.499 --> 23:23.167
- Yeah well, you're
not a spy anymore.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.853
(light clanking)

23:25.854 --> 23:27.537
- I feel like we should
take a trip somewhere,

23:27.540 --> 23:28.406
get outta here.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.774
- Go where?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.075
- I don't know, anywhere.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.713
England, France, Nepal.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.065
- Cool.
- Yeah,

23:37.066 --> 23:38.416
instead of reading and
tryin' to replicate,

23:38.418 --> 23:40.101
you know let's go.

23:40.102 --> 23:41.785
Boots on the ground, taste
the food, see Mount Everest.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.788
Just escape.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.491
- I've always wanted
to see Mount Everest.

23:47.493 --> 23:49.126
- Could cash in
some airline miles,

23:49.128 --> 23:51.095
go for a week, just
enough time to recharge.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.830
- Refresh.
- Invigorate.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.167
Just forget about all
our troubles, you know?

23:56.169 --> 23:57.134
- What troubles?

23:59.138 --> 24:01.205
- Not troubles, just stresses.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.608
Life's little crosses
we all have to bear.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.227
- Yeah?

24:06.228 --> 24:07.845
But we agreed that we'd
spend money on the house

24:07.847 --> 24:10.214
instead of carelessly
dropping out on vacations.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.949
I mean for instance,

24:11.950 --> 24:13.683
we still have to install
the track lighting.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.188
- Yeah, but do we really
want the track lighting?

24:17.190 --> 24:19.457
- Of course we want
the track lighting.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.692
It's part of the lighting
package that we picked out.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.494
And if we don't have that,

24:23.496 --> 24:25.029
what is the point of
having this island

24:25.031 --> 24:26.914
in the kitchen
without the island?

24:26.915 --> 24:28.798
Where are we gonna put the
stools that we had pre-ordered?

24:28.801 --> 24:31.235
Without stools, where's
everyone gonna congregate

24:31.237 --> 24:32.478
at the dinner party?

24:32.479 --> 24:33.720
- What dinner party?

24:33.721 --> 24:34.962
- Corey.
- What?

24:34.963 --> 24:36.204
- We're gonna have a
lot of dinner parties.

24:36.209 --> 24:37.208
- We are?

24:38.678 --> 24:39.677
- Yeah.

24:40.880 --> 24:44.482
(soft bossa nova music)

24:52.892 --> 24:57.194
(Corey grunting and thudding)
(birds chirping)

24:57.196 --> 25:01.165
(intriguing foreboding music)

25:02.134 --> 25:05.002
(Corey wincing)

25:12.044 --> 25:14.178
- What the hell is this?

25:15.114 --> 25:19.016
- This is an intervention.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.618
- [Spies] Hi, Corey.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.654
- (chuckles) An intervention.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.156
What the fuck do I need an
intervention for, Smuts?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.993
- Listen man, we know
you're miserable.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.044
- Miserable?

25:30.045 --> 25:31.094
No, I am not miserable.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.663
My life is great.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.864
- We've been watching.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.100
Your life sucks.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.735
- You've been spying on me.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.669
- We're spies.

25:38.671 --> 25:39.737
That's what we do.

25:39.739 --> 25:40.771
- Oh my god.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.573
- We wouldn't be true spies

25:42.575 --> 25:45.042
if we allowed you to
waste away like this.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.011
- Yeah, so you
decided to shoot me.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.279
Great.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.546
- I had to test
the new tranq gun.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.684
(soft intriguing music)

25:53.686 --> 25:54.852
- Who the hell is this?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.921
- Remora aka Suckerfish.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.806
Smuts gave me the code name.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.690
After you left, he brought
me into handle the grunt work

26:00.693 --> 26:01.776
he didn't wanna do.

26:01.777 --> 26:02.860
Isn't that right, Smuts?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.963
- Yeah, thanks.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.234
I mean he's my minion basically.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.605
- As much as I
appreciate being dragged

26:14.607 --> 26:16.974
all the way down here
and told my life sucks,

26:17.777 --> 26:19.043
you're wrong.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.678
I love my life.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.313
I love that I get to
wake up every morning,

26:22.315 --> 26:23.981
go to work and come home.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.249
No chance of being shot.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.717
No chance of being blown up.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.369
Now call me crazy,

26:28.370 --> 26:30.020
but the change is
actually quite refreshing.

26:31.657 --> 26:34.191
(gun cocking)

26:34.994 --> 26:36.093
Really?

26:36.095 --> 26:39.196
- Corey, this is a safe place.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.415
- Why do you keep
talking like that?

26:41.416 --> 26:43.633
- Corey, Smuts and I wanted
to create a circle of trust

26:43.636 --> 26:44.835
so you felt comfortable.

26:44.837 --> 26:45.803
- Corey,

26:47.139 --> 26:49.873
there's somebody we'd
like you to meet.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.276
- Oh, fantastic.
(door clanking)

26:52.278 --> 26:54.612
Fine, but then I'm leaving.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.982
- Okay, thank you.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.820
(wheelchair squeaking)

27:12.231 --> 27:14.031
- Corey, my name
is Dr. Studebaker

27:14.033 --> 27:15.633
and I have been
doing some analysis

27:15.635 --> 27:19.036
on the field research
I was provided. (snaps)

27:19.038 --> 27:20.638
I prepared a few images.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.007
(slides clicking)
(soft bossa nova music)

27:23.009 --> 27:24.008
Frustration,

27:25.945 --> 27:26.944
anger.

27:29.915 --> 27:30.564
- Big one.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.214
- [Dr. Studebaker] Denial

27:34.053 --> 27:35.886
and finally, acceptance.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.326
- (claps) Bravo, Smuts.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.294
You put a few pictures
together, what's the point?

27:44.296 --> 27:46.997
- My point is the reason you
can't settle into suburban life

27:46.999 --> 27:48.766
has nothing to do
with the life itself.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.668
- Oh, well I can
maintain an erection

27:50.670 --> 27:51.802
if that's what
you're gettin' at.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.671
- I know, we have the slides.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.675
Corey, you have
unfinished business.

27:57.677 --> 28:00.277
- What the hell are
you talkin' about?

28:00.279 --> 28:02.346
- You failed your last mission

28:02.348 --> 28:05.349
and rather than face your
failure, what did you do?

28:05.351 --> 28:06.717
You ran away.

28:06.719 --> 28:09.987
I believe that failure's
causing these strong emotions

28:09.989 --> 28:11.989
of frustration in
your present life

28:12.992 --> 28:15.826
and until you succeed
at a final mission,

28:16.395 --> 28:17.861
you won't be able to settle into

28:17.863 --> 28:20.064
a peaceful and
tranquil existence.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.968
- Well, thank you
very, very much

28:24.970 --> 28:26.470
for the psychobabble bullshit.

28:26.472 --> 28:27.938
But trust me when I tell you

28:27.940 --> 28:30.274
my life is perfectly fine, okay?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.110
And the last thing I need
is to chase some lunatic

28:33.112 --> 28:34.712
half way across the globe.

28:34.714 --> 28:37.147
- You know, you
wouldn't have to go far.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.248
The mission's here.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.250
Egan's back.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.886
(soft intriguing music)

28:42.888 --> 28:44.405
- Great.

28:44.406 --> 28:45.923
Then you won't have to go
far to get him, will ya?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.791
- Egan recently got married

28:47.793 --> 28:51.061
and is mysteriously
honeymooning here.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.398
We believe he's tryin' to
acquire plans for a weapon

28:54.400 --> 28:55.866
from a local sell.

28:55.868 --> 29:01.739
(intense foreboding music)
(slides clicking)

29:05.211 --> 29:08.245
We've arranged for you to come
back for this one mission.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.081
You start tomorrow.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.854
- What the hell don't
you understand, Smuts?

29:16.856 --> 29:18.288
I'm just not interested, okay?

29:18.290 --> 29:20.124
- Corey, they're only doing this

29:20.126 --> 29:21.492
because they care about you.

29:21.494 --> 29:22.960
They want to help.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.396
- I don't need their help

29:25.397 --> 29:27.831
and I damn sure don't need
this fucking intervention.

29:27.833 --> 29:28.832
- Okay.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.043
(soft somber music)

29:50.222 --> 29:55.359
(seagulls squawking)
(helicopter blades whirring)

30:00.332 --> 30:01.932
(soft patriotic music)

30:01.934 --> 30:03.934
- Lemme guess,

30:03.936 --> 30:05.803
the shrink was right and
you're only doing this

30:05.805 --> 30:08.038
so you can settle down
in your married life?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.473
- I hate you.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.541
- Welcome back.

30:14.013 --> 30:17.080
- Egan's set to arrive
Friday before noon.

30:17.082 --> 30:20.851
He'll be stayin' in a
suite at the Pines Hotel

30:20.853 --> 30:23.821
and unlike your
perfect marriage,

30:23.823 --> 30:25.956
we're convinced his is a cover.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.391
- So what's our strategy?

30:27.393 --> 30:29.359
- You're to mirror
his every move.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.196
You've come in town
for your honeymoon

30:32.198 --> 30:34.231
and will be stayin'
in adjacent suite

30:34.233 --> 30:35.599
with one of our field agents

30:35.601 --> 30:37.234
who's gonna pretend
to be your wife.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.236
- Hold on, hold on.

30:39.237 --> 30:41.237
You want me to pretend to
be married to someone else?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.890
- Yeah.

30:42.891 --> 30:44.541
- (chuckles softly) This
is the best you guys

30:44.543 --> 30:46.009
could come up with?

30:46.011 --> 30:49.580
Wow you didn't drag me all
the way down here for this

30:49.582 --> 30:50.547
did you, Smuts?

30:52.184 --> 30:53.851
- Smuts has had me
prepare the research

30:53.853 --> 30:56.070
and all of our modeling confirms

30:56.071 --> 30:58.288
that pretending to be married
gives us the greatest access.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.109
- Relax, Corey.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.094
You can still clip
coupons, trim hedges

31:04.096 --> 31:06.864
and come home to
Pam every night.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.900
I just need you to bond
with Egan and his Mrs.

31:09.902 --> 31:14.538
and get the plans for a weapon
that could wipe us all out.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.074
We don't know what it is.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.609
It could be a laser, it
could be an atom bomb.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.512
I don't know.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.413
I just know that
lives are at risk!

31:23.415 --> 31:26.450
Are you willing to have
blood on your hands

31:26.452 --> 31:29.353
because you're married
all of a sudden?!

31:32.324 --> 31:33.957
That's on you, brother.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.680
- All right.

31:39.681 --> 31:42.465
Fine I'll do it, but I'm
only doin' it for Pat.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.270
(soft patriotic music)

31:46.272 --> 31:49.339
- Once you befriend
Egan and his new bride,

31:49.341 --> 31:52.309
you should be close
enough to use this.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.312
(buttons beeping)

32:05.624 --> 32:08.926
(machine whirring)

32:11.163 --> 32:13.196
- Smuts told me to play around
in a lab for a few weeks

32:13.198 --> 32:15.332
and I came up with this.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.934
It's actually a
visual lie detector.

32:16.936 --> 32:17.818
See these buttons?

32:17.819 --> 32:18.701
Itty-bitty cameras.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.237
When you speak directly to Egan,

32:20.239 --> 32:21.928
it'll scan his face,

32:21.929 --> 32:23.618
send that information
back to these monitors

32:23.619 --> 32:25.308
where we can determine
if he's lying or not.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.177
- And we're sure this works.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.514
- Corey, you ever think
about leaving Pam?

32:30.516 --> 32:33.150
- No, absolutely not.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.085
(device buzzing)

32:35.087 --> 32:36.086
- It works.

32:36.088 --> 32:39.990
Let's make sure to fully
weaponize Corey's house

32:39.992 --> 32:42.576
for his own protection.

32:42.577 --> 32:45.161
Oh and since you're back, we'll
go ahead and pick up the tab

32:45.164 --> 32:47.631
on your domestic beers.

32:48.534 --> 32:52.135
(soft intriguing music)

32:57.509 --> 32:59.209
- Smuts, I'm on-site.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.471
The preventative
security measures

33:00.472 --> 33:01.732
are ready to be installed.

33:01.733 --> 33:02.993
You can count on me.

33:02.994 --> 33:04.254
I'm takin' care of business,
doing it by the book:

33:04.255 --> 33:05.515
tackling objectives,
checking boxes.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.019
Smuts?

33:10.756 --> 33:12.055
- [Rick] Where
the hell is Corey?

33:12.691 --> 33:14.975
- He wanted me to tell you

33:14.976 --> 33:17.260
that he has set up
several off-site meetings

33:17.262 --> 33:20.397
with potential buyers and that
you should be proud of him

33:20.399 --> 33:22.532
because he's thinkin'
outside of the box.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.385
- All right, get back to work.

33:25.386 --> 33:27.136
A-B-C, always be cardboarding.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.376
- Here's your key.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.211
Agent Panzant's
waiting for you inside.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.079
I hear she's hot.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.215
- What's your point?

33:38.216 --> 33:40.350
- My point is it's your
job to hook up with her.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.419
- I'm married, remember?

33:42.421 --> 33:45.355
I'm only doin' this to
get Egan, find closure.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.656
- Uh-huh.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.158
- (scoffs) Trust me.

33:48.159 --> 33:49.659
Once this is over, it's
gonna take my relationship

33:49.660 --> 33:51.160
to a whole other
level, all right?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.162
- Sure.

33:53.298 --> 33:54.498
- Whoa hey, hold up.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.433
You're not comin' in?

33:56.435 --> 33:57.634
- Why would I do that?

33:57.636 --> 34:01.171
- I don't know, we just
always worked together.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.739
- Right.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.376
Oh my gosh.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.713
Oh my gosh!

34:11.150 --> 34:13.450
You're afraid to be alone
in a room with a hot girl.

34:13.452 --> 34:17.354
What, are you afraid you're
gonna give into the temptations

34:17.356 --> 34:18.522
on the other side of that door?

34:18.524 --> 34:19.990
- All right, all right.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.457
- Like a real therapy session

34:21.460 --> 34:24.127
where you're just takin'
out your daily aggressions.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.413
- Is that how you do it?
- Then when it's all done,

34:26.414 --> 34:28.698
you guys just lay in like a
kiddie pool of your own sweat

34:28.700 --> 34:33.336
in the middle of the bed
exhausted, but feelin' good.

34:33.338 --> 34:35.338
Secret is safe with me, dude.

34:36.341 --> 34:37.607
Spy's honor.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.278
- You're an idiot.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.651
(sensual jazz music)

34:47.653 --> 34:48.969
- I hope you don't mind.

34:48.970 --> 34:50.286
I'm a sort of a method spy.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.824
- Method spy, huh?

34:53.825 --> 34:55.358
- You know, like
a method actress.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.761
I have to live it to be it.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.147
- Right.
- And to be honest,

35:00.148 --> 35:02.532
our whole relationship,
our marriage,

35:05.504 --> 35:07.571
I'm just not really feeling it.

35:07.573 --> 35:11.741
- Feeling what?
- Us, together as a couple.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.243
I mean, think about it.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.711
Would someone like
me ever actually

35:14.713 --> 35:16.179
be attracted to
someone like you?

35:16.181 --> 35:17.747
- Oh okay, I see.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.583
Then how do you
know someone like me

35:19.584 --> 35:21.418
would be attracted
to someone like you?

35:23.489 --> 35:24.855
- 'Cause you look married.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.828
- Okay.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.130
¶ Please don't give up on me ¶

35:33.132 --> 35:34.831
¶ I know that ¶

35:34.833 --> 35:38.168
(cellphone buzzing)

35:40.139 --> 35:41.439
- Where are you?

35:41.440 --> 35:42.740
Is everything okay?

35:42.741 --> 35:44.041
- Everything's fine.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.342
Everything's fine.

35:45.343 --> 35:46.643
I got a ton of work to do
so don't wait up, okay?

35:46.645 --> 35:50.280
(intriguing bongo music)

35:59.458 --> 36:02.425
(glove squishing)

36:04.163 --> 36:07.197
(razor scratching)

36:07.199 --> 36:10.867
(rhythmic orchestral music)

36:17.176 --> 36:18.642
- This is much better.

36:18.644 --> 36:22.379
- I'm not agreeing, but
I'm not disagreeing.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.114
- I totally think we should
be one of those couples

36:24.115 --> 36:25.848
who just can't keep their
hands off each other.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.250
(hand smacking)

36:27.252 --> 36:29.386
See you at nine tomorrow.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.521
- Yeah, see you at nine.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.591
Smuts, fill me in.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.559
Gimme the details.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.526
What's the skinny?

36:37.930 --> 36:40.730
- I had to buy 50k
in boxes from Corey,

36:40.732 --> 36:42.966
so his boss wouldn't
get suspicious.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.284
- Got it.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.601
Did you consider spacing
out the deliveries

36:45.604 --> 36:46.836
to make it look more legitimate?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.205
Just an idea.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.839
You wanna grab a
beer after this?

36:52.611 --> 36:53.610
Smuts?

36:56.615 --> 36:58.949
- Corey?
- You're still up.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.483
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

37:03.789 --> 37:04.838
What?!

37:04.839 --> 37:05.888
- What, what's goin' on?

37:07.559 --> 37:08.558
- Your hair.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.763
- Oh yeah, got it cut.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.765
Just thought a little
style couldn't hurt.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.834
- But it's kinda ridiculous.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.104
- All right, so maybe she
went a little overboard.

37:21.105 --> 37:22.871
I don't see why you have
to freak out about it.

37:22.874 --> 37:23.740
- I'm not freaking out.

37:23.742 --> 37:24.975
- A little bit.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.432
- Okay, I am.

37:26.433 --> 37:27.888
But if I suddenly came home

37:27.889 --> 37:29.344
with some weird and crazy
hairdo, you'd freak out too.

37:29.348 --> 37:31.070
- You did.

37:31.071 --> 37:32.793
You cut your hair short.

37:32.794 --> 37:34.516
- Okay wait, you're saying
you don't like my hair?

37:35.420 --> 37:36.953
- What?

37:36.954 --> 37:38.487
- When I came home with it cut,
you said you loved my hair.

37:38.488 --> 37:40.021
- What was I
supposed to say, Pam?

37:40.022 --> 37:41.555
Wow honey, did you
just join the Marines?

37:42.361 --> 37:43.660
- Oh okay, I'm sorry.

37:43.661 --> 37:44.960
I didn't realize
that our relationship

37:44.963 --> 37:48.031
was one based on looks alone.

37:48.033 --> 37:48.932
- You know what
I'm tryin' to say.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.267
- No, I don't.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.937
Something else you
haven't told me yet?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.940
- No. (sighs)

37:57.943 --> 37:59.676
- What is going on?!

37:59.678 --> 38:00.844
- (grunts) What's goin' on?

38:00.846 --> 38:02.412
What's wrong?

38:02.414 --> 38:03.713
- Your chest.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.551
- Oh yeah, I used a little
men's hair body removal cream.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.986
What's the big deal?
- Oh my god.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.921
- What?
- Nothing, it's just

38:14.526 --> 38:16.593
you call me to tell me
that you're working late

38:16.595 --> 38:19.996
and little did I know that you
were on your way to the spa,

38:19.998 --> 38:21.965
turning yourself
into a metrosexual.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.773
Everything just seems a little
bit suspicious, that's all.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.709
- Nothing is going on

38:32.710 --> 38:34.410
that needs to make
you suspicious, okay?

38:41.386 --> 38:45.055
(Corey breathing heavily)
(button clicking)

38:45.057 --> 38:48.525
(electricity buzzing)

38:51.530 --> 38:54.831
(laser blasting)
(tub clanking)

38:54.833 --> 38:55.932
- What was that?

38:57.736 --> 38:59.903
- Just somethin' else
I'm gonna have to fix.

38:59.905 --> 39:03.473
(soft foreboding music)

39:04.576 --> 39:05.725
- Oh god, it's not happening.

39:05.726 --> 39:06.875
It can't be happening.

39:07.646 --> 39:08.695
Oh, it's happening.

39:08.696 --> 39:09.745
He's having an affair.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.616
- Well fuckin' duh, dude.

39:13.618 --> 39:15.135
God, it'd be so much easier

39:15.136 --> 39:16.653
if his ass didn't
look so good in jeans.

39:16.655 --> 39:18.355
- I mean where the
fuck did it go wrong?

39:18.357 --> 39:19.656
- Where did it go wrong?

39:19.658 --> 39:21.008
I mean come on, look at the guy.

39:21.009 --> 39:22.359
He sells fuckin'
boxes for a living.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.702
He's desperate.

39:23.703 --> 39:25.044
Of course he's gonna fall
for some firm ass model

39:25.045 --> 39:26.386
who lives for
alcohol and orgasms.

39:26.387 --> 39:27.728
He probably shocked
he could get her.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.116
I mean, I was shocked.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.500
Come on, can you believe it?

39:32.371 --> 39:33.770
- But what should I do?

39:34.940 --> 39:36.573
You know, do I steal his phone?

39:36.575 --> 39:37.730
- Yes.

39:37.731 --> 39:38.886
- Hack into his email?
- Fuck yeah.

39:38.887 --> 39:40.042
- I can't just spy on the guy.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.411
- Oh, yes you can.

39:42.447 --> 39:43.113
- Really?

39:43.115 --> 39:44.047
But I can't.

39:44.048 --> 39:44.980
- You can.
- I shouldn't.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.183
- You should.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.384
- What am I even talking about?

39:47.385 --> 39:48.585
I'm driving myself crazy.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.203
- It's okay.

39:50.204 --> 39:51.820
It's okay to go crazy
'cause he's a dick, okay?

39:51.823 --> 39:53.656
And dicks make bitches crazy.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.626
Look at me, you
need to spy on him.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.061
That way you can catch
him in the motel,

39:58.063 --> 39:59.529
you can kick down the door

39:59.530 --> 40:00.996
and kick that collegiate
nympho to the curb.

40:00.997 --> 40:02.463
I'll be there and I'll be
videotaping everything.

40:02.464 --> 40:03.930
We'll put it on YouTube,
we'll get a ton of views.

40:03.935 --> 40:04.934
It'll be great.

40:07.606 --> 40:12.742
(painting clacking)
(couple panting pleasurably)

40:15.881 --> 40:17.481
(sensual jazz music)

40:17.482 --> 40:19.082
- The sound's drivin' me wild.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.685
- Are we really gonna sit here

40:22.687 --> 40:24.487
and listen to this shit all day?

40:26.158 --> 40:30.460
- Trust me, I've done a lotta
sex stakeouts in my day.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.928
Either Egan's a really good spy

40:31.930 --> 40:34.531
or homeboy's really fuckin'.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.073
Get the camera.
- Excuse me.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.909
- Told you I'm method.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.811
My character's in the mood.

40:47.812 --> 40:49.712
- All right, I am not
method and my character--

40:50.916 --> 40:52.749
- Actually this is a
really bad angle for you.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.151
Can you just crane your
neck to left a little bit?

40:55.153 --> 40:56.503
- What the hell are you doin'?

40:56.504 --> 40:57.854
- Huh?
- You better not be gentle.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.789
- (chuckles) C'mon, man.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.723
This is for my Christmas
party blooper reel.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.860
Remember that footage I
got of you and Graciela

41:03.862 --> 41:04.915
from two years ago?

41:04.916 --> 41:05.969
- Smuts, how many times
do I have to tell you

41:05.970 --> 41:07.023
that I am fuckin' married?

41:07.024 --> 41:08.077
- Personally, I think
open relationships

41:08.078 --> 41:09.131
are quite progressive.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.602
- Wow you're a real
freak, aren't you?

41:12.604 --> 41:14.771
Just shut up and point
the camera, all right?

41:14.773 --> 41:16.873
Now if you could just
get a little closer,

41:16.875 --> 41:18.608
make it feel real.

41:18.610 --> 41:19.876
(cellphone buzzing)

41:19.878 --> 41:21.511
- Hello?

41:21.513 --> 41:23.046
Hey, baby.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.580
- No no no, we'll never
use any of this wife stuff.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.615
It's not that kind of a movie.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.284
- What am I up to?

41:27.285 --> 41:28.952
Just bangin' lots of boxes.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.220
- There we go.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.487
- No no no no, do not do that.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.068
Do not do that.

41:33.069 --> 41:34.647
I will do it in 15
minutes and I'll be there.

41:34.648 --> 41:36.226
- Just bring it down
a little bit please.

41:36.228 --> 41:37.827
- Okay, bye.

41:37.829 --> 41:41.030
Listen as much fun as
this is, I have to go.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.165
- Now?
- Now?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.417
- Yeah, now.

41:43.418 --> 41:44.668
You're the one who told me

41:44.669 --> 41:45.919
not to let Pam get
suspicious, remember?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.170
- (scoffs) You
totally killed it.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.538
- Well Smuts can fill in.

41:48.540 --> 41:49.606
Have a blast.

41:49.608 --> 41:50.624
- You can't leave.

41:50.625 --> 41:51.641
We're in the middle
of a mission.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.909
- So am I.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.911
It's called savin' my marriage.

41:54.913 --> 41:58.915
- Sound like a mission
impossible, right?

42:17.802 --> 42:19.969
- What, that's stainless.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.804
Thought we talked
about brushed nickel.

42:21.806 --> 42:24.541
- Oh, well we changed our mind.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.944
- But the brushed nickel
goes with the vanity hangers.

42:27.946 --> 42:30.146
- Yeah, I'm changing
the vanity hangers.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.682
- So then what's the purpose
of me being here, Pam?

42:32.684 --> 42:34.083
- I wanted your input.

42:35.754 --> 42:38.655
(shopping cart rattling)

42:38.657 --> 42:42.058
(soft intriguing music)

42:48.967 --> 42:52.035
(foreboding music)

42:57.309 --> 43:00.877
(soft intriguing music)

43:03.114 --> 43:04.347
- Get here.

43:04.349 --> 43:07.684
(both grunting)

43:07.686 --> 43:09.836
Where's the gun?

43:09.837 --> 43:11.987
Where is it?! (breathes heavily)

43:18.163 --> 43:21.164
(scanner beeping)

43:22.901 --> 43:25.001
- What the hell was that?
- What?

43:25.003 --> 43:27.070
Nothing, gonna be fine.

43:29.674 --> 43:32.141
- Corey, you just had
a guy in a headlock.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.210
- You know it's better to
be safe than sorry, right?

43:34.212 --> 43:35.945
- I mean imagine
if someone we knew

43:35.947 --> 43:37.714
had seen you acting like that.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.499
(cellphone buzzing)

43:39.500 --> 43:41.283
Never would've come to
one of our dinner parties.

43:41.286 --> 43:42.819
- What dinner parties?

43:45.624 --> 43:46.990
Hey, Rick.

43:46.992 --> 43:49.392
- Corey, get your ass
in the office now.

43:49.394 --> 43:51.127
- Okay, I'm on my way.

43:52.330 --> 43:55.031
I gotta get back to the
office, I'll see you then?

43:55.033 --> 43:55.999
- Sure.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.302
(soft intriguing music)

43:59.304 --> 44:00.770
- Nice hair.

44:00.772 --> 44:01.804
- Nice clothes.

44:03.642 --> 44:05.074
- Nice ass.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.043
- You wanted to
see me there, Rick?

44:10.315 --> 44:12.649
- Cardboard Corey's back.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.052
- He is.

44:16.054 --> 44:17.387
- Goin' to Pines Hotel.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.789
Three days, two nights,
all-expense paid.

44:20.725 --> 44:21.791
- Boy, the Pines.

44:22.661 --> 44:24.394
I don't know what to say.

44:24.396 --> 44:25.928
- You think you're shocked.

44:25.930 --> 44:27.347
- I couldn't believe it

44:27.348 --> 44:28.765
when that 10,000 box
order came through.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.850
- 10,000.

44:30.851 --> 44:32.934
- You broke the company
record, broke my record.

44:33.938 --> 44:36.072
You damn near broke
the world record.

44:36.074 --> 44:37.707
How'd you do it?

44:37.709 --> 44:39.242
- Oh you know, Rick.

44:39.244 --> 44:41.227
I just took your advice

44:41.228 --> 44:43.211
and (clicks) thought
outside the box.

44:43.214 --> 44:45.982
- Mm-hmm, well you're not
gettin' off that easy.

44:46.751 --> 44:48.206
- I'm not?

44:48.207 --> 44:49.662
- Starting today, I'm gonna
have the rest of the guys

44:49.663 --> 44:51.118
follow us to your meetings.

44:51.122 --> 44:53.189
You know, see how a real
professional does it.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.357
- Wow Rick, you know.

44:55.927 --> 44:57.377
I don't want the
other guys to know.

44:57.378 --> 44:58.828
You know I like to work alone.

44:58.830 --> 45:00.096
Just me, you know?

45:00.097 --> 45:01.363
It helps me kinda focus in.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.167
- Takes teamwork to
make a dream work.

45:07.005 --> 45:08.738
You did watch tape two, right?

45:11.142 --> 45:12.175
- Yeah.

45:12.177 --> 45:14.210
(rhythmic drum music)

45:14.211 --> 45:16.244
- Hey Corey, congrats
on that hotel thing.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.730
- [Corey] Yeah
thanks a lot, Bob.

45:17.731 --> 45:19.214
- I thought I was
gonna win this year.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.851
But 10,000 boxes, huh?

45:24.856 --> 45:26.233
That's somethin'.

45:26.234 --> 45:27.611
- Trust me, it's nothin'.

45:27.612 --> 45:28.989
- Yeah, but I don't
need a five-star suite.

45:28.993 --> 45:31.828
Just another place my wife
wouldn't have sex with me.

45:33.364 --> 45:34.897
- Okay, yeah.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.199
- We'll see you tonight.

45:37.102 --> 45:39.001
- Tonight?
- Bowling, remember?

45:39.003 --> 45:40.336
Got the tournament,
Diana's Floral.

45:40.338 --> 45:41.204
- Shit.

45:41.206 --> 45:42.305
Yeah, right.

45:42.306 --> 45:43.405
Of course, I'll
see you guys there.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.511
- I told you to be here at 6:03.

45:48.513 --> 45:51.013
It's 6:10, where
the hell were you?

45:51.015 --> 45:52.348
- Oh I'm sorry, Smuts.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.283
Before your little intervention,

45:54.285 --> 45:57.286
I had something called a
life that I had to deal with.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.155
- I always just
called it pitiful.

45:59.157 --> 46:00.423
- How tight are these?

46:01.893 --> 46:02.992
(Corey grunting)

46:02.994 --> 46:04.644
Well it's funny you say that

46:04.645 --> 46:06.295
because this whole time I've
been dealin' with the fact

46:06.297 --> 46:11.434
that you bought 10,000
boxes from me in one day.

46:12.871 --> 46:13.937
What happened to the fact that
I told you to space it out,

46:13.938 --> 46:15.004
you know make it look legit?

46:15.006 --> 46:16.406
- What'd you expect me to do,

46:16.407 --> 46:17.807
go in and fill out
a form every day?

46:17.809 --> 46:18.941
I'm not gonna waste my time.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.443
I've got things to do.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.095
- Things to do.

46:22.096 --> 46:23.746
Oh, that's great.

46:23.747 --> 46:25.397
Well just so you
know thanks to you,

46:25.398 --> 46:27.048
now I'm dealing with heat
from home, heat from work.

46:27.051 --> 46:28.317
- Actually, I'm in heat.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.287
Is that odd?

46:33.057 --> 46:35.925
(computer whirring)

46:35.927 --> 46:38.461
Actually, I'm in heat.
- Yes.

46:39.798 --> 46:41.431
- Goddammit.

46:41.432 --> 46:43.065
All right, let's get
our head in the game.

46:43.067 --> 46:46.335
Claudia and Egan's restaurant
reservation is for seven p.m.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.306
- How come your suit fits?

46:50.308 --> 46:51.507
- Oh, thank you.

46:52.310 --> 46:55.478
(birds chirping)

46:55.480 --> 46:59.215
- [Brianna] He is not even
going to recognize you.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.927
- Brianna, I look like a hooker.

47:10.929 --> 47:12.361
I'm supposed to be undercover,

47:12.363 --> 47:14.430
not auditioning for strip clubs.

47:16.467 --> 47:19.468
Look, every year when I wanted
to start my own business,

47:19.470 --> 47:22.905
I would go out and buy
something smart, sophisticated.

47:22.907 --> 47:25.842
Something that says
I mean business.

47:26.978 --> 47:28.144
So this is me.

47:28.146 --> 47:31.514
I'm finally saying
I mean business.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.416
- I love it.

47:33.417 --> 47:35.317
You just need to hire my
lip girl and you're done.

47:36.287 --> 47:38.120
- God, who am I kidding?

47:38.122 --> 47:39.055
I can't do this.

47:39.056 --> 47:39.989
I don't want to do this.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.525
This is not who I am.

47:42.527 --> 47:45.361
- Pam, you listen to me, okay?

47:45.363 --> 47:47.463
You need to reclaim yourself.

47:47.465 --> 47:50.266
You are a sexy, wild bitch.

47:52.003 --> 47:54.103
- That would be embarrassing.

47:54.105 --> 47:56.639
Some risks aren't worth taking.

47:57.942 --> 48:01.510
(sensual jazz music)
(glasses clinking)

48:01.512 --> 48:03.012
- You see 'em?

48:03.014 --> 48:04.280
- Oh you mean the sexy couple

48:04.281 --> 48:05.547
that's actually
having a good time?

48:13.892 --> 48:15.075
Vodka, meat.
- Club soda.

48:15.076 --> 48:16.259
- He'll have a martini.

48:16.261 --> 48:18.427
- Club soda.
- Straight up with a twist.

48:21.266 --> 48:23.432
- What are you doin'?

48:23.434 --> 48:24.951
- What are you doing?

48:24.952 --> 48:26.469
You know, you should be
believable as my husband.

48:26.471 --> 48:28.221
- Believable?

48:28.222 --> 48:29.972
Let's not forget I'm the
one who's married here.

48:29.974 --> 48:31.685
- Oh please.

48:31.686 --> 48:33.397
Another big night
for you at home

48:33.398 --> 48:35.109
is probably watching reruns
and eating leftovers,

48:35.113 --> 48:36.479
but our marriage is not stuck

48:36.481 --> 48:38.147
on opposite sides of the bed.

48:38.149 --> 48:39.649
- Oh trust me, darling.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.150
My marriage happens
all over the bed.

48:45.390 --> 48:46.389
- Thank you.

48:47.525 --> 48:48.524
Cheers.

48:50.094 --> 48:54.330
(glasses clinking)
(Alexandria chuckling softly)

48:54.332 --> 48:55.598
Okay, big picture.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.999
We need to connect with Egan,

48:57.001 --> 48:58.601
so you need to connect with me.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.670
So drink up, look at me
like you wanna fuck me

49:00.672 --> 49:02.972
and check your baggage
with the bellhop.

49:03.975 --> 49:05.642
- What baggage?

49:05.643 --> 49:07.310
- What do you
mean, what baggage?

49:07.311 --> 49:08.978
Remember Corey, this
is your intervention.

49:10.214 --> 49:12.148
- You knew about that.

49:12.150 --> 49:15.351
(sensual jazz music)

49:17.956 --> 49:19.288
- Has anyone considered
they might actually

49:19.290 --> 49:21.090
just be here on their honeymoon?

49:23.594 --> 49:25.461
- No chance.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.329
Everything they do is
too connected, forced.

49:29.500 --> 49:32.368
Trust me, that's not
what married people do.

49:33.104 --> 49:34.103
- Ooh.

49:46.517 --> 49:48.017
- What are you doin'?

49:48.019 --> 49:49.018
- What?

49:50.655 --> 49:51.988
Should I stop?

49:55.059 --> 49:58.627
Is it bad?

49:58.629 --> 49:59.628
Huh?

50:01.699 --> 50:05.301
Is it not what
married people do?

50:05.303 --> 50:08.504
- Alex, sit down.

50:08.506 --> 50:10.106
- Why?

50:10.108 --> 50:12.408
- Because you're
drawing attention.

50:12.410 --> 50:13.509
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:14.278 --> 50:15.511
- Who's looking at me?

50:17.382 --> 50:18.681
Are the waiters watching?

50:19.484 --> 50:20.750
What about Egan?

50:22.286 --> 50:23.586
Is he watching?

50:25.056 --> 50:26.789
What about you?

50:26.791 --> 50:28.557
Are you watching?

50:28.559 --> 50:30.159
- You're gonna blow this.

50:30.161 --> 50:31.160
- Oh, you.

50:32.063 --> 50:35.297
(sensual jazz music)

50:39.237 --> 50:42.471
(Alexandria thudding)

50:53.451 --> 50:58.554
(hands smacking)
(intense tribal drumming)

51:03.327 --> 51:06.529
(sensual jazz music)

51:09.700 --> 51:13.302
(intense electro music)

51:36.828 --> 51:39.162
Get up.

51:39.163 --> 51:41.497
(rhythmic saxophone music)

52:08.326 --> 52:11.393
(Alexandria sighing)

52:11.395 --> 52:15.397
(Alexandria chuckling softly)

52:37.755 --> 52:41.157
(sensual jazz music)

52:45.530 --> 52:47.096
I'm sorry I borrowed
your husband,

52:47.097 --> 52:48.663
but this place
was a little dead.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.825
- Are you kidding?

52:50.826 --> 52:52.051
That was the most fun
we've had on our honeymoon.

52:52.052 --> 52:53.277
- Wait, you're on
your honeymoon?

52:53.278 --> 52:54.503
We're on our honeymoon.

52:54.505 --> 52:55.838
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.841
- Shut up.
- Oh, I love you.

52:58.843 --> 53:01.343
Hopefully we'll see
you guys some more.

53:01.345 --> 53:03.846
- Well we're gonna be
hanging by the pool tomorrow.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.481
Just drop on by.

53:05.483 --> 53:06.849
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.216
- I hope you don't
mind if we turn in.

53:08.217 --> 53:09.583
I just got super tired.

53:09.587 --> 53:13.322
(Alexandria chuckling)

53:13.324 --> 53:14.323
- Bye.

53:19.463 --> 53:22.464
Okay, so now we have a pool
date with them tomorrow.

53:22.466 --> 53:24.767
I guess you convinced
them you wanna fuck me.

53:25.503 --> 53:27.236
(watch beeping)

53:27.238 --> 53:28.504
- Shit, I gotta go.

53:28.506 --> 53:30.272
- Go where?!

53:30.274 --> 53:33.676
- Bowling tournament.
- Pfft. (chuckles)

53:35.880 --> 53:38.380
- You guys shoulda seen
this Home & Garden Show.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.282
Took up the entire Civic Center.

53:40.284 --> 53:44.620
I mean they had pools,
tubs, lawn care, everything.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.455
I even won a raffle.

53:46.457 --> 53:47.756
- What'd you win?

53:47.758 --> 53:50.292
- Leaf blower, a good one too.

53:50.294 --> 53:51.894
- Nice.
- No shit.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.495
- You're excited about
a leaf blower, Bob?

53:54.298 --> 53:55.965
- And you'll be too.

53:55.966 --> 53:57.633
Come fall all those
trees in your yard,

53:57.635 --> 53:59.902
you're gonna be beggin'
me to borrow it.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.805
- No, I just mean
there's gotta be more

54:02.807 --> 54:04.873
to get excited about, right?

54:04.875 --> 54:07.543
Leaf blowers and goddamn
home shows, is that it?

54:08.379 --> 54:10.246
- It's an acquired appreciation.

54:11.249 --> 54:14.350
- Look, all I'm sayin'
is you guys even notice

54:14.352 --> 54:16.552
that all we ever talk
about is the yard

54:16.554 --> 54:19.488
or adding a deck or
buying a new grill?

54:20.891 --> 54:22.908
There's got to be more to life

54:22.909 --> 54:24.926
than the fuckin' hardware
store, am I right?

54:27.598 --> 54:29.048
- No, not really.

54:29.049 --> 54:30.499
The only thing that
excited me last year

54:30.501 --> 54:32.635
was when I put a
kegerator in my garage.

54:32.637 --> 54:34.003
- [Fred] That was awesome.

54:37.275 --> 54:40.442
- So you're tellin' me that
this is all there is to life?

54:40.444 --> 54:43.712
What we're livin' right
here, right now, this is it?

54:44.715 --> 54:46.548
- Yeah, how hard is it?

54:46.550 --> 54:48.267
You get married.

54:48.268 --> 54:49.985
You watch each other
go to complete hell.

54:49.987 --> 54:52.688
Have a kid maybe
two, stop having sex.

54:52.690 --> 54:54.990
Save for retirement, get
the golden handshake.

54:54.992 --> 54:57.026
Play golf on the weekends.

54:57.027 --> 54:59.061
Take a dick pill, realize
that was a mistake.

54:59.063 --> 55:00.996
Pick out where you want
your ashes scattered,

55:00.998 --> 55:04.533
leave everything to the
kids and hopefully you know,

55:04.535 --> 55:06.769
a lotta people show
up at your funeral.

55:06.771 --> 55:08.671
- I'll come to
your funeral, Fred.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.657
- Thanks, Ted.

55:11.658 --> 55:13.875
- Corey, it's not like
there's some grand adventure

55:13.878 --> 55:15.778
out there waiting for us.

55:15.780 --> 55:18.347
(Ted gulping)

55:18.349 --> 55:20.749
We're just livin' life
like everyone else.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.719
- And you guys are
okay with that?

55:25.623 --> 55:27.089
(soft intriguing music)

55:27.091 --> 55:28.457
- [All] Yeah.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.459
- Aren't you?

55:33.397 --> 55:35.331
- Yeah, 'course I am.

55:47.678 --> 55:48.744
- You're home late.

55:49.613 --> 55:50.612
- I had bowling.

55:51.682 --> 55:52.681
- Really?

55:52.683 --> 55:54.383
Then why were there two messages

55:54.384 --> 55:56.084
from the guys wondering
where you were?

55:56.085 --> 55:57.785
- Well I showed up late
'cause I had to work late.

55:57.788 --> 55:59.021
Big day at the office.

55:59.023 --> 56:01.891
- Another one?

56:01.892 --> 56:04.760
- Actually, I won
the all-expense paid
resorts vcation.

56:08.366 --> 56:09.832
- Well then let's go.

56:09.834 --> 56:11.633
- Wait, you wanna go?

56:11.635 --> 56:13.836
- Yes, let's go this weekend.

56:13.838 --> 56:15.604
- No, I can't.

56:15.606 --> 56:17.005
- You can't what?

56:17.007 --> 56:18.574
You were the one
that wanted to take

56:18.575 --> 56:20.142
a spur-of-the-moment
trip, why not do it?

56:22.380 --> 56:23.529
- Because I can't, Pam.

56:23.530 --> 56:24.679
You know, all right?

56:24.680 --> 56:25.829
I mean plus, I thought
we were gonna do stuff

56:25.830 --> 56:26.979
around the house.
- Like what?

56:27.852 --> 56:30.018
- (sighs) Track lighting.

56:30.020 --> 56:31.653
- Are you mocking me?

56:33.023 --> 56:34.123
- Are you mocking me?

56:34.925 --> 56:35.924
- Are you drunk?

56:37.161 --> 56:39.278
- I'm not drunk, Pam.

56:39.279 --> 56:41.396
I had a few martinis
and a couple of beers.

56:42.633 --> 56:44.149
- What's gotten into you?
- What's gotten into you?

56:44.150 --> 56:45.666
- I just wanna do
something different.

56:45.669 --> 56:47.503
- And I just wanna
lay on the couch.

56:47.505 --> 56:48.670
- Fine.

56:48.672 --> 56:50.005
- Fine.

56:50.007 --> 56:53.409
(pillows thudding)

56:53.411 --> 56:54.443
(sighs) What was that for?

56:54.445 --> 56:55.511
- The couch.

56:55.513 --> 56:56.512
Goodnight.

57:06.056 --> 57:10.459
(tribal drum music)
(fire crackling)

57:10.461 --> 57:14.163
- Blissfully committed
to their simple routine,

57:14.165 --> 57:17.032
the cave people never felt
the need to seek excitement

57:17.034 --> 57:18.667
from the outside world.

57:20.571 --> 57:23.972
Unfortunately for us,
well that outside world

57:23.974 --> 57:27.109
was quickly unraveling
any sense of routine.

57:32.716 --> 57:33.949
Morning.

57:38.122 --> 57:40.055
- Morning.

57:40.056 --> 57:41.989
(rhythmic intriguing music)

57:44.061 --> 57:46.462
Operation: Catch
Corey is back on.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.420
- [Man] Rick says
we're all goin'

57:54.421 --> 57:55.704
on a sales call together.

57:57.775 --> 57:59.608
- Yeah, lemme just
confirm everything

57:59.610 --> 58:01.477
and we'll get on outta here.

58:01.479 --> 58:02.478
- Alrighty.

58:03.614 --> 58:07.015
(soft intriguing music)

58:15.025 --> 58:17.159
- Oh, that little sneak.

58:41.285 --> 58:43.018
(device whirring)

58:43.020 --> 58:44.987
- (scoffs) My god, do
you ever wear clothes?

58:44.989 --> 58:46.489
- Excuse me, what
you're seeing here

58:46.490 --> 58:47.990
is top-of-the-line
tactical gear.

58:47.992 --> 58:50.225
This spy-kini she's wearing
is completely bulletproof,

58:50.227 --> 58:52.261
fireproof and waterproof.

58:52.262 --> 58:54.296
- My character sees your
character wearing this.

58:56.233 --> 58:58.267
Oh I assumed you're small.

59:01.305 --> 59:03.939
- You're tellin' me
these can stop a bullet.

59:03.941 --> 59:05.207
- Sure.

59:05.209 --> 59:06.525
- Don't get shot.

59:06.526 --> 59:07.842
- They're waiting
down by the pool.

59:07.845 --> 59:08.944
- Yeah, I'm not wearing these.

59:08.946 --> 59:10.312
- You're gonna have to.

59:10.313 --> 59:11.679
They've already
stitched the cameras in.

59:11.682 --> 59:12.681
- Where?

59:15.252 --> 59:18.020
(pen beeping)

59:18.022 --> 59:20.088
- Here, just put it on.

59:21.825 --> 59:23.759
(soft rhythmic drumming)

59:23.761 --> 59:26.328
- All right, I'll put 'em on.

59:28.165 --> 59:30.032
But I'm not doin'
it for you guys,

59:31.235 --> 59:33.635
I'm gonna do it for
the mission, for Pam.

59:42.246 --> 59:47.583
(doorknob squeaking)
(soft intriguing music)

1:00:00.598 --> 1:00:02.931
- Oh hey, how are you guys?

1:00:08.672 --> 1:00:09.805
- I've got a visual.

1:00:13.010 --> 1:00:15.143
- I just feel so stupid.

1:00:15.145 --> 1:00:17.779
I mean here I am
following my own husband

1:00:17.781 --> 1:00:19.147
into a fucking honeymoon suite.

1:00:19.149 --> 1:00:20.616
- Oh my god, he's a
frickin' polygamist.

1:00:20.618 --> 1:00:21.934
I knew it.

1:00:21.935 --> 1:00:23.251
Everybody watches a couple
episodes of "Big Love"

1:00:23.252 --> 1:00:24.568
and then they think they
can do whatever they want.

1:00:24.569 --> 1:00:25.885
Sorry honey, we're closed.

1:00:25.889 --> 1:00:26.755
- Oh my god, there they are.

1:00:28.258 --> 1:00:31.326
Oh it would just be so much
easier if she's a mess,

1:00:31.328 --> 1:00:32.817
but she's--
- Pam.

1:00:32.818 --> 1:00:34.307
(vocalizes) I do not even
wanna hear what she looks like

1:00:34.308 --> 1:00:35.797
because there is no way in hell

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:37.299
that she's prettier than you.

1:00:38.636 --> 1:00:40.186
All right, tell me
what she looks like.

1:00:40.187 --> 1:00:41.737
- Like some femme
fatale Bond villain

1:00:41.739 --> 1:00:43.672
that just graduated from
Harvard with a degree

1:00:43.674 --> 1:00:44.973
in you know fucking up my life.

1:00:44.975 --> 1:00:46.108
- Stop.

1:00:46.110 --> 1:00:47.398
You have to take the reins here.

1:00:47.399 --> 1:00:48.687
You're his wife, okay?

1:00:48.688 --> 1:00:49.976
You cannot let this
other woman win.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:53.348
(soft intriguing music)

1:00:57.121 --> 1:00:59.321
- Hey when you got it,
you flaunt it right?

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:06.228
- When we first decided
to honeymoon here,

1:01:06.230 --> 1:01:08.930
so many people were like,
"Well that's different,

1:01:09.933 --> 1:01:11.767
"but it's just so
beautiful here."

1:01:13.937 --> 1:01:16.772
- I know, I had never been
to upstate New York before.

1:01:16.774 --> 1:01:18.807
But the moment he proposed,

1:01:18.809 --> 1:01:21.076
he insisted he had
to honeymoon here.

1:01:22.413 --> 1:01:24.046
- I'm at a total loss.

1:01:24.047 --> 1:01:25.680
This is not the
man that I married.

1:01:25.683 --> 1:01:27.082
- You need to go confront him.

1:01:27.084 --> 1:01:28.283
- I can't.
- You can.

1:01:28.285 --> 1:01:29.651
What do you want me to do?

1:01:29.652 --> 1:01:31.018
You want me to drive up there?

1:01:31.019 --> 1:01:32.385
I'll drive up there and I
will cut Corey's dick off.

1:01:32.386 --> 1:01:33.752
I will Lorena Bobbitt
that motherfucker.

1:01:33.757 --> 1:01:35.791
I will take his dick and I
will throw it in the forest

1:01:35.793 --> 1:01:36.959
and a little squirrel
will pick it up

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.126
and run away and
put it in its nest

1:01:38.128 --> 1:01:39.294
and he'll never have it again.

1:01:39.296 --> 1:01:40.162
He'll be dickless.

1:01:40.164 --> 1:01:41.480
- Brianna.

1:01:41.481 --> 1:01:42.797
- I can cut his nuts
off if that's better.

1:01:42.798 --> 1:01:44.114
If the dick's too much,

1:01:44.115 --> 1:01:45.431
you know I can always
take the balls.

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:46.947
My grandma used to do it
with the hens all the time.

1:01:46.948 --> 1:01:48.459
- Look, no one's nuts
are being cut off.

1:01:48.460 --> 1:01:49.971
- (sighs) Well then you
need to go confront him.

1:01:49.973 --> 1:01:53.075
(soft intriguing music)

1:01:53.077 --> 1:01:55.944
- So why did you decide to
honeymoon in Glens Falls?

1:01:55.946 --> 1:01:57.379
- We've been jet-setting
around the world

1:01:57.381 --> 1:02:00.449
for the last two years
straight for business,

1:02:00.451 --> 1:02:03.752
so we wanted something
quaint and charming,

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:06.888
a bit out of the
way, off-the-grid.

1:02:11.128 --> 1:02:12.628
- How 'bout you guys?

1:02:12.629 --> 1:02:14.129
What made you select
a place off-the-grid?

1:02:15.332 --> 1:02:16.331
- Same.

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:19.401
Off-the-grid's the desired
honeymoon destination,

1:02:19.403 --> 1:02:20.802
am I right?

1:02:20.804 --> 1:02:24.406
(intense intriguing music)

1:02:40.791 --> 1:02:42.124
You know service
is kinda slow here.

1:02:42.126 --> 1:02:43.459
I think I'm gonna go
order from the bar.

1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:44.793
Do you guys want anything?

1:02:44.794 --> 1:02:46.127
- Why don't we split a
decent bottle of champagne?

1:02:47.297 --> 1:02:48.296
- Great idea.

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:51.032
- Little birdie's on the move.

1:02:51.969 --> 1:02:53.869
- That's my birdie.

1:02:53.871 --> 1:02:58.273
(intriguing orchestral music)

1:02:58.275 --> 1:02:59.908
- You have something I need.

1:03:01.311 --> 1:03:04.346
(fingers whacking)

1:03:06.450 --> 1:03:09.217
(man thudding)

1:03:17.327 --> 1:03:19.528
(pen tearing)

1:03:23.801 --> 1:03:24.366
- Shit.

1:03:24.367 --> 1:03:24.932
- [Remora] What happened?

1:03:25.836 --> 1:03:28.270
(soft intriguing music)

1:03:28.272 --> 1:03:29.337
- Can you help me?

1:03:36.346 --> 1:03:37.279
- Almost got it.
- All right, all right.

1:03:37.281 --> 1:03:38.346
That's fine.

1:03:38.348 --> 1:03:39.548
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:03:39.550 --> 1:03:42.818
(glasses clinking)

1:03:45.823 --> 1:03:47.355
- Honey, you're sweating.

1:03:47.357 --> 1:03:48.907
Why don't you take
a dip and cool off?

1:03:48.908 --> 1:03:50.458
- And you should reapply
the sunscreen, sweetheart.

1:03:50.460 --> 1:03:52.260
You're startin' to burn.

1:03:52.262 --> 1:03:53.261
- Fine.

1:03:57.301 --> 1:03:58.500
- [Remora] All right
Corey, play it off.

1:03:58.502 --> 1:04:00.402
Don't let Egan suspect anything.

1:04:00.404 --> 1:04:03.939
(soft intriguing music)

1:04:11.348 --> 1:04:16.484
- Mmm, feels so good.
(moans pleasurably)

1:04:20.490 --> 1:04:23.425
- Do you wanna grab a beer
or something after this?

1:04:23.427 --> 1:04:25.227
- How many times do
I have to tell you?

1:04:26.129 --> 1:04:27.362
I don't wanna hang.

1:04:27.364 --> 1:04:29.231
I don't wanna grab a beer.

1:04:29.232 --> 1:04:31.099
We're not gonna watch
the game together.

1:04:31.101 --> 1:04:33.134
- Okay, I just see how
cool you and Corey are

1:04:33.136 --> 1:04:35.403
and I was hoping that someday
you and I might have that,

1:04:35.405 --> 1:04:38.106
be more than just two
guys saving the world.

1:04:38.108 --> 1:04:40.158
- Suckerfish, Corey and I,

1:04:40.159 --> 1:04:42.209
we've been buddies
since we were teens.

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:45.146
We were recruited together
and we trained together.

1:04:45.148 --> 1:04:49.618
We've spoiled some pretty
crazy plots around the globe.

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:50.619
I mean,

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:57.025
you know I'm the only one
that knows Corey's real name?

1:04:58.195 --> 1:04:59.194
- Wow.

1:05:01.198 --> 1:05:04.432
- You and I, we just
don't have that history.

1:05:06.536 --> 1:05:08.370
- Yeah you and I don't
have that history yet,

1:05:08.372 --> 1:05:09.604
but someday we might.

1:05:09.606 --> 1:05:13.608
- I just don't really
see that happening.

1:05:14.511 --> 1:05:16.578
(intriguing orchestral music)

1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:18.580
- [Remora] Oh shit,
look who's here.

1:05:22.586 --> 1:05:23.618
- Aw, shit.

1:05:29.426 --> 1:05:30.458
Aw, shit.

1:05:32.229 --> 1:05:33.561
This is bad.

1:05:33.563 --> 1:05:35.163
This is really bad.

1:05:39.169 --> 1:05:42.304
(cellphone buzzing)

1:05:43.073 --> 1:05:46.408
(intriguing spy music)

1:05:50.514 --> 1:05:53.648
(cellphone buzzing)

1:05:58.555 --> 1:06:02.490
(Alexandria scoffing)

1:06:02.492 --> 1:06:04.492
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh nothing.

1:06:04.494 --> 1:06:06.228
What's up with you?

1:06:06.229 --> 1:06:07.963
- Is there a reason you
called me three times, Pam?

1:06:07.965 --> 1:06:09.397
I just stepped out of a meeting.

1:06:09.399 --> 1:06:10.632
- Oh, what kind of a meeting?

1:06:10.634 --> 1:06:12.000
- A business meeting.

1:06:12.001 --> 1:06:13.367
- Oh yeah, what were
you talking about?

1:06:13.370 --> 1:06:14.669
- Why are you acting like this?

1:06:14.671 --> 1:06:15.982
- Acting like what?

1:06:15.983 --> 1:06:17.294
I'm just tryin' to ask
you about your day,

1:06:17.295 --> 1:06:18.606
see if you're doin' all right.

1:06:18.608 --> 1:06:20.075
Curious what you're up to.

1:06:20.076 --> 1:06:21.543
- That's why you called?
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:21.545 --> 1:06:22.928
Oh no, actually.

1:06:22.929 --> 1:06:24.312
I need you to drop by the store.

1:06:24.314 --> 1:06:26.381
- What?
- Yeah, it's on your way home.

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:29.417
- Okay fine, just text it to me.

1:06:29.419 --> 1:06:30.618
- Why can't you write it down?

1:06:30.620 --> 1:06:31.619
- Pam.

1:06:34.257 --> 1:06:36.524
Just tell me and
I'll remember, okay?

1:06:36.526 --> 1:06:39.294
- Okay some cinnamon, cardamom,

1:06:39.296 --> 1:06:41.780
semi-sweetened dark chocolate,

1:06:41.781 --> 1:06:44.265
pine nuts, mocha extract,
light syrup, cocoa powder,

1:06:44.267 --> 1:06:47.669
pastry shells and some
(inhales) Popsicle sticks.

1:06:47.671 --> 1:06:48.887
- Okay, got it.

1:06:48.888 --> 1:06:50.104
- Okay, now repeat
it back to me.

1:06:50.107 --> 1:06:52.157
- What?

1:06:52.158 --> 1:06:54.208
- Just repeat it,
so I know you know.

1:06:54.211 --> 1:06:55.210
- I know what it is, Pam.

1:06:55.212 --> 1:06:56.277
- Then repeat it.

1:06:56.279 --> 1:06:59.514
(intriguing orchestral music)

1:06:59.516 --> 1:07:02.283
- Popsicle sticks, cinnamon.

1:07:03.754 --> 1:07:06.788
- Some cinnamon, cardamom,
semi-sweetened dark chocolate,

1:07:06.790 --> 1:07:09.391
pine nuts, mocha
extract, cocoa powder,

1:07:09.393 --> 1:07:11.292
pastry shells and
Popsicle sticks.

1:07:11.294 --> 1:07:12.427
- Fine.

1:07:12.429 --> 1:07:14.229
- Did you write it down?

1:07:14.231 --> 1:07:16.031
- Pam, I told you I'll remember.

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:16.698
- Oh really?

1:07:16.700 --> 1:07:18.923
Oh I'm so sorry.

1:07:18.924 --> 1:07:21.147
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1:07:21.148 --> 1:07:23.371
Here I am rambling on and on
while you're trying to work.

1:07:23.373 --> 1:07:25.707
That's it, you're hard
at work by the pool,

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:29.110
having some tramp rubbing
sun lotion in your back.

1:07:29.112 --> 1:07:30.378
- Pam?
- What?

1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:31.780
What's the matter?

1:07:31.781 --> 1:07:33.181
You've too many
wives to remember?

1:07:33.183 --> 1:07:35.316
- No Pam, just wait.

1:07:35.318 --> 1:07:36.329
What's with the hat?

1:07:36.330 --> 1:07:37.341
(Pam grunting)
(purse smacking)

1:07:37.342 --> 1:07:38.353
(Smuts scoffing)

1:07:38.355 --> 1:07:39.696
- God.

1:07:39.697 --> 1:07:41.038
Swear to god, we need to put
an restraining order on her.

1:07:41.039 --> 1:07:42.380
- Yeah, she can
be a little crazy.

1:07:42.381 --> 1:07:43.722
Maybe I should just check.

1:07:44.728 --> 1:07:47.629
(intriguing orchestral music)

1:07:47.631 --> 1:07:49.130
- That's his ex-fiancee.

1:07:49.733 --> 1:07:51.533
She's a tad bit delusional.

1:08:00.077 --> 1:08:01.476
(cellphone buzzing)

1:08:01.478 --> 1:08:03.711
- Shit, yeah?

1:08:03.713 --> 1:08:06.614
(razor buzzing)

1:08:06.616 --> 1:08:09.184
- I hate making these calls.
- What calls?

1:08:09.186 --> 1:08:10.636
- The ones where
I let people go.

1:08:10.637 --> 1:08:12.087
- What're you
talkin' about, Rick?

1:08:12.089 --> 1:08:13.388
I'm your best salesman, righT?

1:08:13.390 --> 1:08:14.823
I mean I won the free trip.

1:08:14.825 --> 1:08:16.224
My sales are through the roof.

1:08:16.226 --> 1:08:17.859
- T-E-A-M.

1:08:17.861 --> 1:08:20.528
I want team players,
not prima donnas.

1:08:20.530 --> 1:08:22.730
Guys see what you're doin'
and start coppin' attitudes,

1:08:22.732 --> 1:08:24.655
doin' things their way.

1:08:24.656 --> 1:08:26.579
Next thing you know, the
whole company goes to shit

1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:28.503
because you wanna play
the game your way.

1:08:28.505 --> 1:08:30.605
- I mean I think I'm settin'
an example here, Rick.

1:08:30.607 --> 1:08:32.240
You know, raising
the bar a little bit.

1:08:32.242 --> 1:08:34.175
- What bar, what example, huh?

1:08:34.177 --> 1:08:35.493
You just left.

1:08:35.494 --> 1:08:36.810
I don't even know where
the hell you are right now.

1:08:36.811 --> 1:08:38.127
- I went on assignment.
- Bullshit.

1:08:38.128 --> 1:08:39.444
That's what I used
to say to my wife

1:08:39.449 --> 1:08:41.249
when I was fuckin' her sister.

1:08:41.251 --> 1:08:42.283
That's it, Corey.

1:08:43.253 --> 1:08:44.419
You're fired.

1:08:44.421 --> 1:08:45.820
- Fuck.

1:08:45.822 --> 1:08:51.159
(tires screeching)
(intriguing spy music)

1:08:52.429 --> 1:08:53.862
Pam, you gotta let me explain.

1:08:53.864 --> 1:08:56.131
- (scoffs) I would love
to hear your explanation

1:08:56.133 --> 1:08:58.766
or you could just go with
I'm screwing somebody else.

1:08:58.768 --> 1:09:00.401
- I'm not having an affair.

1:09:00.403 --> 1:09:01.369
- I know, I know.

1:09:01.371 --> 1:09:02.960
You married her.

1:09:02.961 --> 1:09:04.550
You're on your honeymoon,
congratufuckinlations.

1:09:04.551 --> 1:09:06.140
- Pam, just listen to me.

1:09:06.143 --> 1:09:07.909
Calm down and let
me explain myself.

1:09:07.911 --> 1:09:09.777
(doorbell dinging)

1:09:09.779 --> 1:09:11.146
Who the fuck is that?

1:09:11.815 --> 1:09:12.814
- The dinner party.

1:09:14.417 --> 1:09:15.959
- Dinner party?

1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:17.502
What fucking dinner party, Pam?

1:09:17.503 --> 1:09:19.045
I mean my god, you
keep goin' on and on

1:09:19.046 --> 1:09:20.588
about these dinner
parties that don't exist!

1:09:20.590 --> 1:09:21.556
We bought dishes.

1:09:21.558 --> 1:09:23.191
We bought a bar.

1:09:23.192 --> 1:09:24.825
I installed a water feature

1:09:24.826 --> 1:09:26.459
all for these dinner parties
that never seem to happen.

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:28.196
- I am not canceling
my dinner party

1:09:28.198 --> 1:09:31.366
just because you had
some sordid affair.

1:09:31.368 --> 1:09:33.568
- I wasn't cheating.

1:09:33.570 --> 1:09:36.538
(doorbell dinging)

1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:38.806
All right look, I'm gonna tell
'em that we made a mistake

1:09:38.808 --> 1:09:40.175
and we'll do this another night.

1:09:40.177 --> 1:09:41.176
- No!

1:09:41.711 --> 1:09:43.378
No no, no you won't.

1:09:43.380 --> 1:09:45.346
You are not ruining
my dinner party

1:09:45.348 --> 1:09:47.248
just because our
marriage is over.

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:54.189
(doorbell dinging)
(intense intriguing music)

1:09:54.658 --> 1:09:55.957
- Hey, everybody.

1:10:00.197 --> 1:10:01.696
- Is this one of them
swingers parties?

1:10:01.698 --> 1:10:04.332
'Cause we didn't
bring any rubbers.

1:10:04.334 --> 1:10:05.900
- (chuckles) We
just thought that

1:10:05.902 --> 1:10:07.552
it would be fine for tonight.

1:10:07.553 --> 1:10:09.203
- Just would be fun to
get dressed up because--

1:10:09.206 --> 1:10:11.206
- Yeah, well we wanted
tonight to be a--

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:12.740
- It's a theme party.
- Yeah.

1:10:14.611 --> 1:10:16.244
- What kinda theme?

1:10:16.245 --> 1:10:17.878
- A spy theme dinner, Bob.
- Yes, exactly.

1:10:17.881 --> 1:10:20.548
You see 007 just
got outta the pool.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:22.461
- [Corey] And Agent 99 here

1:10:22.462 --> 1:10:24.373
was just about to
make some drinks.

1:10:24.374 --> 1:10:26.285
- I've got martinis;
shaken, not stirred.

1:10:26.289 --> 1:10:28.323
- Who wants to be
Money Penny? (claps)

1:10:28.325 --> 1:10:29.557
All right, shall we?

1:10:29.559 --> 1:10:32.961
(intriguing drum music)

1:10:35.365 --> 1:10:37.966
(door bashing)

1:10:54.584 --> 1:10:59.687
- Cheers.
(glasses clinking)

1:11:04.761 --> 1:11:07.462
- You know Pam, we woulda
perfectly understood

1:11:07.464 --> 1:11:08.763
if you needed to cancel.

1:11:10.567 --> 1:11:11.933
- Why would I have to cancel?

1:11:11.935 --> 1:11:13.701
- Well if I got
fired, the only party

1:11:13.703 --> 1:11:17.405
we'd be havin' that night
is my funeral. (chuckles)

1:11:18.842 --> 1:11:22.677
(soft orchestral music)

1:11:22.679 --> 1:11:24.713
- You know what?

1:11:24.714 --> 1:11:26.748
I think he did say
something about that.

1:11:32.956 --> 1:11:35.423
- You weren't supposed
to say anything, Ted.

1:11:35.425 --> 1:11:37.558
- Here are my Parmesan
portobello slices

1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:38.760
with sun-dried tomato.

1:11:40.063 --> 1:11:41.462
- Pam, these are so good.

1:11:41.464 --> 1:11:43.698
Do you have a secret ingredient?

1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:45.400
- Oh I'm sorry, Bob.

1:11:45.402 --> 1:11:48.303
My secret is what you
see is what you get.

1:11:48.305 --> 1:11:52.607
No little white lies,
no half-truths, no
funny little fibs.

1:11:52.609 --> 1:11:53.908
- Bob, will you
excuse us a second?

1:11:53.910 --> 1:11:55.221
- Why?

1:11:55.222 --> 1:11:56.533
No, they're fine.

1:11:56.534 --> 1:11:57.845
They already know that
you lost your job.

1:11:57.847 --> 1:11:59.981
I just found out from Fred.

1:11:59.983 --> 1:12:01.700
- Oh, I'm Ted.

1:12:01.701 --> 1:12:03.418
- Pam, you have
to let me explain.

1:12:03.420 --> 1:12:07.455
- Trust me, this way
it'll be so much easier

1:12:07.457 --> 1:12:08.723
to split up the assets.

1:12:14.431 --> 1:12:17.865
- Corey, now that we're not
competin' over the trip,

1:12:17.867 --> 1:12:20.768
you wanna tell me how you
sold so many damn boxes?

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:26.841
(doorbell dinging)
(intense intriguing music)

1:12:27.844 --> 1:12:29.610
- [Brianna] What
the fuck is this?

1:12:29.612 --> 1:12:32.013
- Brianna, are you okay?

1:12:32.015 --> 1:12:33.715
- Am I okay?

1:12:33.717 --> 1:12:35.800
Am I okay?

1:12:35.801 --> 1:12:37.884
I just spent an hour in
the car convincing myself

1:12:37.887 --> 1:12:40.855
you didn't leap to your death
and here you are having a--

1:12:40.857 --> 1:12:42.090
- [Pam] A dinner party.

1:12:43.026 --> 1:12:44.625
- A dinner party.
- Yeah.

1:12:44.627 --> 1:12:46.394
- Well why wasn't I invited?

1:12:46.396 --> 1:12:49.530
- It's sort of a couples-only.

1:12:49.532 --> 1:12:50.943
- Oh, couples-only.

1:12:50.944 --> 1:12:52.355
Why are you still
wearing that costume?

1:12:52.356 --> 1:12:53.767
- 'Cause it's a spy
theme dinner party.

1:12:53.770 --> 1:12:55.703
- Oh, a spy theme dinner party.

1:12:55.705 --> 1:12:57.638
Ooh, so fancy.

1:12:57.640 --> 1:12:58.706
You know what, Pam?

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:01.693
I just can't believe
after hours of me

1:13:01.694 --> 1:13:04.679
listening to your marital
woes, this is how I'm treated.

1:13:06.416 --> 1:13:08.783
But if the name's not
taken, I'm Pussy Galore.

1:13:08.785 --> 1:13:13.921
(doorbell dinging)
(intense intriguing music)

1:13:14.691 --> 1:13:16.658
- The hell are you doin' here?

1:13:16.659 --> 1:13:18.626
- We have to get you--
- Hi, I'm Pam.

1:13:18.628 --> 1:13:20.528
I didn't get to
introduce myself earlier

1:13:20.530 --> 1:13:22.797
because you're whoring yourself
around with my husband.

1:13:22.799 --> 1:13:25.099
But I just want to let
you know that tomorrow

1:13:25.101 --> 1:13:27.252
we are getting a divorce.

1:13:27.253 --> 1:13:29.404
But tonight I'm having
my dinner party, okay?

1:13:29.406 --> 1:13:30.605
- I came by to say
that I'm sorry.

1:13:30.607 --> 1:13:32.084
- Sorry you got caught or sorry

1:13:32.085 --> 1:13:33.562
that you're a whore
that lacks style?

1:13:33.563 --> 1:13:35.040
- Sorry because this
isn't what it looked like.

1:13:35.044 --> 1:13:36.160
- Exactly.

1:13:36.161 --> 1:13:37.277
- Don't insult my intelligence.

1:13:37.278 --> 1:13:38.394
- No, I'm serious.

1:13:38.395 --> 1:13:39.511
Alexandria here is an actress.

1:13:39.516 --> 1:13:40.548
- A method actress actually.

1:13:40.550 --> 1:13:42.183
- Superbly talented.

1:13:42.185 --> 1:13:43.951
- Okay I saw, remember.

1:13:45.455 --> 1:13:46.454
- Right.

1:13:47.624 --> 1:13:49.340
You see, sweetheart.

1:13:49.341 --> 1:13:51.057
I found out that a huge
potential client and his wife

1:13:51.060 --> 1:13:52.794
were gonna be honeymooning
over at that hotel.

1:13:52.796 --> 1:13:56.197
So I thought why not hire
an actress to play my wife,

1:13:56.199 --> 1:13:58.566
go to the hotel, bond with
guy and make the big sale.

1:13:58.568 --> 1:14:00.034
- Yeah I mean, it was
completely legitimate.

1:14:00.036 --> 1:14:02.003
I've been in the business
since I was a kid.

1:14:02.005 --> 1:14:03.571
Lots of musical theater.

1:14:03.573 --> 1:14:05.290
- Yeah, whatever.

1:14:05.291 --> 1:14:07.008
Look, why don't you help
yourself to a doggie bag

1:14:07.010 --> 1:14:08.793
and then you can choke on it?

1:14:08.794 --> 1:14:10.577
- Oh, I'm staying here
'cause Corey hired me

1:14:10.580 --> 1:14:11.612
to be here for the dinner party.

1:14:11.614 --> 1:14:13.548
- That's right, I did.

1:14:13.550 --> 1:14:14.749
- To do what?

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:18.853
- To teach dance.

1:14:19.856 --> 1:14:20.855
Cue the music.

1:14:21.991 --> 1:14:24.759
(drum rolling)

1:14:26.796 --> 1:14:28.095
(tribal drum music)

1:14:28.097 --> 1:14:29.530
Dance with me.

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:41.642
- You lucky son of a bitch.

1:14:46.983 --> 1:14:47.949
- Spin me.

1:14:49.252 --> 1:14:50.485
Egan's on his way.

1:14:53.890 --> 1:14:56.191
- You could not have
hired her tonight.

1:14:56.192 --> 1:14:58.493
You didn't even remember that
we were having a dinner party.

1:14:59.596 --> 1:15:02.063
- You have to get these
people out of here.

1:15:02.065 --> 1:15:04.031
Go ahead and ask
your wife to dance.

1:15:06.202 --> 1:15:08.636
You have to get these
people out of here.

1:15:08.638 --> 1:15:10.438
- Fine.

1:15:10.439 --> 1:15:12.239
If people are dancing,
we're dancing.

1:15:13.676 --> 1:15:17.612
("Wheels Fall Off" by Madyx)

1:15:43.706 --> 1:15:46.007
(car engine roaring)
(tires screeching)

1:15:46.009 --> 1:15:49.710
¶ You can try to stop me ¶

1:15:49.712 --> 1:15:50.845
¶ You can ¶

1:15:50.847 --> 1:15:52.680
¶ You can try to stop me ¶

1:15:52.682 --> 1:15:57.818
¶ And I'm goin' 'til
the wheels fall off ¶

1:15:58.588 --> 1:15:59.820
- I need you to come clean.

1:15:59.822 --> 1:16:01.088
Just be honest with me.

1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:04.825
I mean if I have ever
meant anything to you

1:16:04.827 --> 1:16:06.928
in any level at any point,

1:16:06.930 --> 1:16:10.598
I deserve to know
what's going on.

1:16:18.741 --> 1:16:21.943
- You're right.

1:16:21.944 --> 1:16:25.146
(doorbell dinging)
(eerie foreboding music)

1:16:28.117 --> 1:16:33.254
(gun blasting)
(bullets pinging)

1:16:38.928 --> 1:16:39.927
- Nobody moves.

1:16:41.898 --> 1:16:43.598
Where is it?

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:44.365
- Don't know.

1:16:45.134 --> 1:16:46.667
- I want my pen back.

1:16:46.668 --> 1:16:48.201
- All right all
right, take it easy.

1:16:48.204 --> 1:16:50.705
But leave them outta
this, they're innocent.

1:16:52.875 --> 1:16:54.242
- No no, yeah you're right.

1:16:54.243 --> 1:16:55.610
We should just keep
this between us,

1:16:55.611 --> 1:16:56.978
but I like a little
bit of insurance.

1:16:56.980 --> 1:16:58.947
- [Corey] No.

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:00.915
- I want my pen back
with the plans on it

1:17:00.916 --> 1:17:02.883
delivered in an hour and why
don't you gas up the jet?

1:17:02.885 --> 1:17:03.985
- A jet?
- Mm-hmm.

1:17:03.987 --> 1:17:05.653
- And if I can't
get it here by then?

1:17:05.654 --> 1:17:07.320
- Then your wife will die.

1:17:07.323 --> 1:17:08.723
- She's not his wife.

1:17:08.725 --> 1:17:10.036
This is his wife.

1:17:10.037 --> 1:17:11.348
- Yeah, could someone
just please explain to me

1:17:11.349 --> 1:17:12.660
what the hell is going on?

1:17:13.730 --> 1:17:15.062
- Honey, I'm a spy.

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:16.197
- Okay, enough of
that charade already.

1:17:16.199 --> 1:17:17.164
- No, I am.

1:17:17.166 --> 1:17:19.116
I'm serious.

1:17:19.117 --> 1:17:21.067
We work for the government
as part of an elite taskforce

1:17:21.070 --> 1:17:23.137
trained to stop high-tech
futuristic weapons

1:17:23.139 --> 1:17:26.240
from falling in the hands
of fuckfaces like this guy.

1:17:26.242 --> 1:17:28.075
- Okay, well this
definitely falls

1:17:28.077 --> 1:17:30.044
under reconcilable differences.

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:34.281
(phone clucking ringtone)

1:17:34.283 --> 1:17:36.117
- Hello?

1:17:36.118 --> 1:17:37.952
- Smuts, I need you to
bring me the pen right away.

1:17:44.694 --> 1:17:46.027
- Okay.

1:17:46.028 --> 1:17:47.361
- You guys weren't
actually married?

1:17:47.363 --> 1:17:49.063
- No.

1:17:49.065 --> 1:17:51.065
- But your ring seemed so real.

1:17:51.067 --> 1:17:52.667
- It was cubic zirconia.

1:17:52.669 --> 1:17:53.834
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.

1:17:53.836 --> 1:17:56.003
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1:17:56.005 --> 1:17:57.705
- So is mine.

1:17:57.706 --> 1:17:59.406
- Wait, but you guys
seem so happy together.

1:17:59.407 --> 1:18:01.107
- No, you guys seemed
so happy together.

1:18:01.110 --> 1:18:02.476
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1:18:02.477 --> 1:18:03.843
Nobody's actually
happy here, okay?

1:18:03.844 --> 1:18:05.210
Let's review: you
and I aren't married.

1:18:05.214 --> 1:18:06.981
These two aren't married.

1:18:06.982 --> 1:18:08.749
The only people here that
are really married are them.

1:18:08.751 --> 1:18:09.951
- Oh, no.

1:18:09.952 --> 1:18:11.152
No, actually we're
getting a divorce.

1:18:11.153 --> 1:18:12.353
(Egan scoffing)
(oven beeping)

1:18:12.355 --> 1:18:14.255
Oh fuck, my lasagna.

1:18:14.257 --> 1:18:15.923
- Whoa, excuse me?

1:18:15.925 --> 1:18:17.058
- My lasagna, it's burning.

1:18:17.060 --> 1:18:18.359
I need to get it.

1:18:18.361 --> 1:18:19.427
- Are you kidding me?

1:18:19.429 --> 1:18:21.145
- Are you kidding me?

1:18:21.146 --> 1:18:22.862
Do you want this
house to burn down?

1:18:22.865 --> 1:18:24.243
- I don't care.

1:18:24.244 --> 1:18:25.622
- To him sweetheart,
I don't think

1:18:25.623 --> 1:18:27.001
your lasagna's the
key issue here.

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:31.372
- It's actually not my
lasagna, it's Stouffer's.

1:18:31.374 --> 1:18:33.974
- You want me to serve
Stouffer's at our dinner party?

1:18:33.976 --> 1:18:35.910
- Well I was gonna
make it from scratch,

1:18:35.912 --> 1:18:39.113
but you in the midst were
playing spy meets adulterer

1:18:39.115 --> 1:18:41.849
meets probably the worst
husband in the world.

1:18:41.851 --> 1:18:43.284
- Honey, I think
you're overreacting

1:18:43.286 --> 1:18:44.785
just a little bit
here, all right?

1:18:44.787 --> 1:18:46.387
I'm gonna take care of this.

1:18:46.388 --> 1:18:47.988
- Overreacting?
(oven door slamming)

1:18:47.990 --> 1:18:49.623
Overreacting.

1:18:49.624 --> 1:18:51.257
Do you know how
humiliating this is?

1:18:52.729 --> 1:18:54.128
You know how heartbreaking it is

1:18:54.130 --> 1:18:55.863
to have your marriage
be over within...

1:18:55.865 --> 1:18:57.064
Okay.

1:18:57.066 --> 1:18:58.365
Oh (mumbles), in a year?

1:19:00.136 --> 1:19:01.529
Seriously?

1:19:01.530 --> 1:19:02.923
I'm now a statistic.

1:19:02.924 --> 1:19:04.317
I'm one of those,

1:19:04.318 --> 1:19:05.711
one of those people
where you probably

1:19:05.712 --> 1:19:07.105
had some I don't know Navy
SEAL mental training shit

1:19:07.110 --> 1:19:10.277
where you know how to handle
all these sorts of situations

1:19:10.279 --> 1:19:12.046
to probably diffuse a
bomb under pressure.

1:19:12.048 --> 1:19:13.147
- The hell is she doin'?

1:19:13.149 --> 1:19:16.117
(crickets chirping)

1:19:16.119 --> 1:19:17.752
- I'm leaving.

1:19:17.754 --> 1:19:19.854
I'm packing my things.

1:19:19.855 --> 1:19:21.955
You can shoot me if you want,
but otherwise I'm moving out.

1:19:23.159 --> 1:19:24.759
- Can you stop her?

1:19:24.761 --> 1:19:25.977
- Can you stop her?

1:19:25.978 --> 1:19:27.194
- Yeah, I could shoot her.

1:19:27.196 --> 1:19:30.798
(soft foreboding music)

1:19:35.972 --> 1:19:36.971
- Let's go.

1:19:37.940 --> 1:19:40.341
(soft intriguing music)

1:19:40.343 --> 1:19:42.143
- I knew we should've
gone to Nepal.

1:19:42.145 --> 1:19:43.310
If not Nepal, Paris.

1:19:43.312 --> 1:19:45.112
If not Pairs, London.

1:19:45.114 --> 1:19:47.481
I mean just done something,

1:19:47.482 --> 1:19:49.849
anything to escape the confines
of this ridiculous place.

1:19:49.852 --> 1:19:51.819
- Pam, sweetheart.

1:19:51.820 --> 1:19:53.787
Let's just get through this
and we can reset, okay?

1:19:53.790 --> 1:19:55.423
We'll call it a
second honeymoon.

1:19:55.424 --> 1:19:57.057
We can go to all those
places, I promise.

1:19:57.059 --> 1:19:58.692
- Okay, so now you don't mind

1:19:58.693 --> 1:20:00.326
about skipping our
weekend projects?

1:20:00.329 --> 1:20:02.196
You know putting off
the track lighting,

1:20:02.198 --> 1:20:05.800
not even fixing the ceiling
that constantly crumbles.

1:20:12.074 --> 1:20:14.125
- How many times do I
have to tell you, Pam

1:20:14.126 --> 1:20:16.177
that I will get to it
when I fucking get to it.

1:20:16.946 --> 1:20:18.345
(ceiling crumbling)

1:20:18.347 --> 1:20:20.848
Press the red button
under the bed.

1:20:21.818 --> 1:20:23.017
(button beeping)

1:20:23.019 --> 1:20:24.151
- Holy shit.

1:20:26.155 --> 1:20:28.222
(laser blasting)

1:20:28.224 --> 1:20:30.090
Okay, what is that?

1:20:30.092 --> 1:20:32.393
- That's a high-tech electrical
charge particle solidifier.

1:20:32.395 --> 1:20:34.829
In short, force field.

1:20:34.831 --> 1:20:37.932
- So you just had this
stuff here the whole time?

1:20:39.101 --> 1:20:40.000
- Yeah, pretty much.

1:20:40.002 --> 1:20:40.968
Sorry.

1:20:40.970 --> 1:20:43.404
- You never thought about
pulling out one of these gizmos

1:20:43.405 --> 1:20:45.839
when we were getting intimate?

1:20:47.076 --> 1:20:48.943
- You would've wanted that?

1:20:48.945 --> 1:20:50.978
- Yeah, I would've tried that.

1:20:50.980 --> 1:20:53.981
- Well, we can.

1:20:53.982 --> 1:20:56.983
- Corey, I'm not having
anymore dinner parties.

1:20:57.954 --> 1:21:02.223
(soft intriguing music)
(window crashing)

1:21:06.128 --> 1:21:11.265
(knife stabbing)
(man wincing)

1:21:16.005 --> 1:21:18.939
(door squeaking)

1:21:21.010 --> 1:21:24.411
(intriguing jazz music)

1:21:35.625 --> 1:21:37.458
Anyone for charades?

1:21:38.661 --> 1:21:40.127
- Who wants a nightcap?

1:21:45.167 --> 1:21:46.567
- [Dispatcher] 60
off 10th Avenue.

1:21:46.569 --> 1:21:48.753
- Come on.

1:21:48.754 --> 1:21:50.938
(muffled radio speech)

1:21:54.343 --> 1:21:56.310
- I just have one question.

1:21:56.312 --> 1:21:57.912
- Yeah?

1:21:57.914 --> 1:21:59.280
- Is your real name Corey?

1:22:02.051 --> 1:22:03.150
- I wish it was.

1:22:06.055 --> 1:22:07.054
- Goodbye.

1:22:08.224 --> 1:22:11.625
(soft intriguing music)

1:22:16.599 --> 1:22:19.500
(device beeping)

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:27.574
- Where are ya headed?
- Does it matter?

1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:34.548
(intriguing bongo music)

1:22:41.123 --> 1:22:42.723
(name tag tearing)

1:22:42.725 --> 1:22:44.325
- Whoa, hey.

1:22:44.327 --> 1:22:46.226
Were you serious?

1:22:46.228 --> 1:22:48.095
- Brianna, wasn't it your idea

1:22:48.097 --> 1:22:49.997
for me to get out of
here and see the world?

1:22:49.999 --> 1:22:51.498
- I mean it was and
then we tried it

1:22:51.500 --> 1:22:53.634
and it was really
exhausting, you know?

1:22:53.636 --> 1:22:54.924
It's like kinky sex.

1:22:54.925 --> 1:22:56.213
You think you want it
'til you actually have it

1:22:56.214 --> 1:22:57.502
and end up with a
penis in your ear.

1:22:57.506 --> 1:22:59.139
- That's disgusting.

1:23:00.042 --> 1:23:01.642
- Do you even have a plan?

1:23:01.644 --> 1:23:02.693
- Yeah.

1:23:02.694 --> 1:23:03.743
- What's your plan?

1:23:03.746 --> 1:23:05.612
- To climb Mount Everest.

1:23:05.614 --> 1:23:08.182
- To climb Mount
Everest, really?

1:23:08.184 --> 1:23:11.352
What, are you working for
"National Geographic" now?

1:23:11.354 --> 1:23:15.222
(soothing bossa nova music)

1:23:32.575 --> 1:23:36.310
- Undercover: Discover
who you really are.

1:23:38.414 --> 1:23:41.315
(wind whistling)

1:23:47.390 --> 1:23:48.406
(ice tool clanking)

1:23:48.407 --> 1:23:49.423
- [Smuts] What about Cairo?

1:23:50.326 --> 1:23:51.291
- Yeah?

1:23:53.295 --> 1:23:56.030
- Cozumel?
- Cozumel's cool.

1:23:57.166 --> 1:24:01.535
- (breathes heavily)
Dude, what's wrong?

1:24:02.438 --> 1:24:03.670
- Nothin's wrong, man.

1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:05.439
- Okay.

1:24:06.675 --> 1:24:08.675
- Oh, what about Rio?

1:24:08.677 --> 1:24:10.044
- I like Rio, you know that.

1:24:10.046 --> 1:24:11.111
- I love Rio.

1:24:12.448 --> 1:24:13.647
What?

1:24:13.649 --> 1:24:15.282
You're not excited about Rio.

1:24:15.284 --> 1:24:16.583
Okay, you must've forgotten

1:24:16.585 --> 1:24:18.869
about that night
in the rainforest.

1:24:18.870 --> 1:24:21.154
- I didn't forget about the
night in the rainforest, Smuts.

1:24:22.158 --> 1:24:23.190
Why can't we keep
it simple, you know?

1:24:23.192 --> 1:24:24.058
Like in the movie.

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:25.059
- What?

1:24:26.095 --> 1:24:27.311
Okay, okay.

1:24:27.312 --> 1:24:28.528
Three feet, three
feet, three feet.

1:24:30.466 --> 1:24:32.332
Okay, that's it.

1:24:32.334 --> 1:24:33.600
The sun's sizzling your brain.

1:24:33.602 --> 1:24:34.835
We've climbed too close.

1:24:34.837 --> 1:24:36.737
C'mon, we need some UV.

1:24:37.573 --> 1:24:39.373
Here, use this.

1:24:39.375 --> 1:24:40.507
It really works.

1:24:40.509 --> 1:24:41.442
- Yeah, I know.

1:24:41.444 --> 1:24:43.261
I got the whole line.

1:24:43.262 --> 1:24:45.079
Even their eye moisturizer's
incredible, isn't it?

1:24:45.081 --> 1:24:46.480
Soothing, too.

1:24:46.482 --> 1:24:48.315
- You really miss her, don't ya?

1:24:50.086 --> 1:24:51.085
- I do not.

1:24:51.087 --> 1:24:54.421
- From my perspective, you
never stopped loving her.

1:24:54.423 --> 1:24:56.223
No matter what your cover was,

1:24:56.225 --> 1:24:58.225
you can't disguise
what's in your heart.

1:24:58.227 --> 1:25:00.194
(somber piano music)

1:25:00.196 --> 1:25:01.161
- Yeah.

1:25:02.631 --> 1:25:04.581
Yeah, maybe.

1:25:04.582 --> 1:25:06.532
- You know, I really
didn't hear what you said.

1:25:06.535 --> 1:25:09.636
But that sounded really
fucking beautiful, Suckerfish.

1:25:09.638 --> 1:25:10.637
- Thanks, man.

1:25:10.639 --> 1:25:15.709
- Hey, you wanna get a
beer with me later on?

1:25:15.711 --> 1:25:16.710
- I'd like that.

1:25:16.712 --> 1:25:18.378
- Just kidding.

1:25:18.380 --> 1:25:20.247
I'm not for the sweet
stuff, let's move.

1:25:20.249 --> 1:25:23.250
(both grunting)

1:25:23.252 --> 1:25:25.185
(ice crumbling)

1:25:25.187 --> 1:25:27.454
Hold up, we got a problem.

1:25:28.858 --> 1:25:32.192
(soft tribal music)

1:25:42.271 --> 1:25:43.537
- Excuse me, sir.

1:25:43.539 --> 1:25:44.404
(man mumbling)

1:25:44.406 --> 1:25:45.806
Jimbo?

1:25:45.808 --> 1:25:47.241
- Very good Jimbo.

1:25:50.246 --> 1:25:51.645
Debit or credit?

1:25:53.249 --> 1:25:58.385
(jet whooshing)
(rhythmic Asian music)

1:26:20.509 --> 1:26:23.477
- "Pam, I hope you
enjoy the basket.

1:26:23.479 --> 1:26:26.163
"I think it would've
been perfect

1:26:26.164 --> 1:26:28.848
"for the second dinner
party we never got to have."

1:26:30.819 --> 1:26:32.186
Dinner party.

1:26:33.422 --> 1:26:34.955
What dinner party?

1:26:45.434 --> 1:26:48.735
(soft bluegrass music)

1:27:03.485 --> 1:27:08.622
(tranq dart whooshing)
(Corey grunting)

1:27:10.826 --> 1:27:15.963
(soft intriguing music)
(Corey wincing)

1:27:17.466 --> 1:27:19.466
- What the hell is this?

1:27:19.468 --> 1:27:23.003
- Corey, this is
an intervention.

1:27:23.005 --> 1:27:24.338
- Oh god, not again.

1:27:24.340 --> 1:27:25.422
For what?

1:27:25.423 --> 1:27:26.505
- Because you're miserable.

1:27:26.508 --> 1:27:27.908
- I'm not miserable.

1:27:29.511 --> 1:27:31.378
- Oh, no no no no.

1:27:31.380 --> 1:27:32.696
What?

1:27:32.697 --> 1:27:34.013
- Yeah, we started dating
after the dinner party.

1:27:34.014 --> 1:27:35.330
- You've been dating
Brianna this whole time

1:27:35.331 --> 1:27:36.647
and you didn't tell me?

1:27:36.652 --> 1:27:39.019
- Look, what was
I supposed to say?

1:27:39.020 --> 1:27:41.387
I mean I'm in covert ops with
your ex-wife's best friend?

1:27:41.390 --> 1:27:43.490
- I love it when
he talks like that.

1:27:43.492 --> 1:27:44.491
- You guys?

1:27:46.662 --> 1:27:48.295
I figured you hated me.

1:27:48.297 --> 1:27:51.498
I was a total pain in the ass
and completely self-centered.

1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:53.700
- I don't care what you were.

1:27:53.702 --> 1:27:55.486
After I canned your ass,

1:27:55.487 --> 1:27:57.271
these guys wouldn't shut
up about your spy tactics.

1:27:57.273 --> 1:27:58.705
When I finally let them try it,

1:27:58.707 --> 1:28:00.707
they broke all
your sales records.

1:28:00.709 --> 1:28:03.043
- Yup, made him go method.

1:28:03.045 --> 1:28:04.795
- We also got a bowling coach

1:28:04.796 --> 1:28:06.546
and kicked the shit
outta Diana's Floral.

1:28:06.548 --> 1:28:08.515
- Bob's been wearin'
his wrist guard.

1:28:08.517 --> 1:28:10.951
- (chuckles) All right, well

1:28:10.953 --> 1:28:12.619
this is all well and good, guys.

1:28:12.621 --> 1:28:14.554
But somebody please tell me

1:28:14.556 --> 1:28:17.958
why the hell you went through
all this trouble and what for?

1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.826
- [Pam] Because I had to
test the new tranq gun.

1:28:20.763 --> 1:28:24.498
(soothing romantic music)

1:28:26.402 --> 1:28:27.918
- Hey.

1:28:27.919 --> 1:28:29.435
- It's actually my tranq gun.
- Dude.

1:28:29.438 --> 1:28:32.056
- So you're the reason
for this intervention?

1:28:32.057 --> 1:28:34.675
- Well if you're not too busy
tryin' to save the world,

1:28:34.677 --> 1:28:36.943
I thought we should
give us another shot,

1:28:37.746 --> 1:28:38.879
a different shot.

1:28:38.881 --> 1:28:41.282
You know if you
hadn't been a spy,

1:28:41.283 --> 1:28:43.684
I would've never woken up
and realized who I really am.

1:28:44.853 --> 1:28:47.654
- What about just being
still looking in the mirror?

1:28:48.590 --> 1:28:50.891
- Where's the adventure
in that, my dear?

1:28:50.893 --> 1:28:53.427
- So does this mean we get
to take a second honeymoon?

1:28:53.429 --> 1:28:54.561
- Anywhere you want.

1:28:54.563 --> 1:28:57.548
- What do you think
about Kathmandu?

1:28:57.549 --> 1:29:00.534
- Oh you know what they say,
"What happens in Kathmandu,

1:29:00.536 --> 1:29:02.536
"stays in Kathmandu."
- "Stays in Kathmandu."

1:29:02.538 --> 1:29:05.806
(soft romantic music)

1:29:07.009 --> 1:29:09.676
- [Corey] Okay, so maybe
the whole intervention thing

1:29:09.678 --> 1:29:12.412
was a little extreme.

1:29:14.516 --> 1:29:17.417
But if we embrace our
primal caveman instincts

1:29:17.419 --> 1:29:19.553
instead of hiding
from them in suburbia,

1:29:21.090 --> 1:29:25.625
we'll realize that every
day can be an adventure.

1:29:25.627 --> 1:29:28.895
