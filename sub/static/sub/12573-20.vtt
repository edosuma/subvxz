if she was forced

35:19.118 --> 35:21.253
to spend some time with you,

35:21.320 --> 35:23.021
she would get to know you,

35:23.089 --> 35:25.924
see who you really are,

35:25.992 --> 35:27.225
and fall in love with you?

35:28.694 --> 35:30.061
Why couldn't she love me?

35:31.397 --> 35:34.799
I may not be a hero
like the Seeker,

35:34.867 --> 35:38.937
or some great scholar

35:39.005 --> 35:40.805
like her husband, but--

35:40.873 --> 35:42.073
I'm an artist.

35:43.543 --> 35:44.643
I've got so much to give.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.011
I can protect her,

35:46.078 --> 35:47.512
be a father to her son.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.848
You have to give Livia a chance

35:49.916 --> 35:52.017
to know you outside this world.

35:52.084 --> 35:54.819
As beautiful as it is...

35:56.122 --> 35:58.256
...it's not real.

36:01.961 --> 36:04.296
<i>Since the Seeker's returned,</i>

36:04.363 --> 36:07.432
he has brought me nothing
but misery and despair.

36:07.500 --> 36:12.137
Time and again he has denied
me victory. No, Egremont.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.041
It ends here.

36:18.077 --> 36:20.845
What of the Book
and its secrets?

36:22.748 --> 36:26.751
Killing the Seeker
is more important than any book,

36:26.819 --> 36:29.220
no matter what secrets
it may hold.

My beautiful painting.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.691
Someone's trying to destroy it.

37:13.391 --> 37:16.092
Why would someone do this?
They're destroying paradise!

37:16.160 --> 37:18.261
RICHARD: You can always
make another painting,

37:18.329 --> 37:20.130
but you can't give people
their lives back.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.965
You said you wanted
to protect Livia.

37:22.033 --> 37:23.566
If you love her,
you can't let her die.

37:24.969 --> 37:27.137
James!

37:27.204 --> 37:29.906
I can't paint six people
before the fire gets here.

37:31.842 --> 37:35.278
But you can paint the library
back to where it belongs.

37:35.346 --> 37:37.213
Along with everyone inside.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.284
Get your easel. Let's go!

37:41.352 --> 37:43.787
You'd better hurry.

37:43.854 --> 37:45.989

What about you?

37:46.057 --> 37:47.324
There isn't time.

Now!

39:23.954 --> 39:25.055
Follow me.

39:26.991 --> 39:29.592
He did it. James saved us.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.227
We should get moving.

39:31.295 --> 39:33.329

You can't stay in Briamont.

39:52.716 --> 39:55.485
It isn't safe for anyone
who's helped the Seeker.

39:55.553 --> 39:57.253
Where will we go?

39:57.321 --> 39:59.222
Bishop's Landing
is two days' walk.

39:59.290 --> 40:02.525

resettle. I can take you.

you can't leave.

40:04.595 --> 40:07.030
What about Dad's work,
your books?

40:07.098 --> 40:09.466
I found the one that matters.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.469
And as long as I have you,
I'll be all right.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.774
I think
you'll be needing this.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.844
I can't thank you enough.

40:20.911 --> 40:23.613
You may have helped bring
this war to an end.

40:25.449 --> 40:27.984
In his heart,
James was a good person.

his sacrifice
wasn't for nothing.

Something on your mind?

41:07.391 --> 41:09.792
I was just thinking
about James,

41:11.562 --> 41:13.696
the world he created.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.068
It would have been nice
to visit...

"To vanquish
the master of all,

41:41.625 --> 41:45.428

the power of Orden."

Orden?

41:48.966 --> 41:51.768
To do that, we'd have
to get the boxes back,

41:51.835 --> 41:54.070

The last time we did that--

I almost became
as evil as Rahl himself.
