At night,

12:34.682 --> 12:37.016
well, I'm sure custodians
would have access.

12:37.082 --> 12:39.949
Did anybody repeatedly
go in to use the computer?

12:40.016 --> 12:42.249
Barbara Martin
in Accounting.

12:42.316 --> 12:46.382
But she's 76. I hardly think
she's into child porn.

12:48.049 --> 12:51.549
Could you make a list
of all the people who go in
and out of the office?

12:51.616 --> 12:54.716
I already have.
I gave it to the police.
Could you give me a copy?

12:54.782 --> 12:57.616
I guess.
[ Sighs ]
Mr. Wall,

12:59.549 --> 13:01.482
you got any idea
who could have done this?

13:01.549 --> 13:03.482
Not Father Ryan.

13:03.549 --> 13:05.116
You sure?
Yes.

13:05.182 --> 13:08.716
How?
I know him.

13:08.782 --> 13:11.416
You know anything else,
Mr. Wall?

13:14.549 --> 13:17.382
I just know that
it couldn't be Father Ryan.

13:23.082 --> 13:25.282
Helen Gamble?
<i>I floated the idea. She--</i>

13:25.349 --> 13:27.216
- Working here?
- Before you go off--

13:27.282 --> 13:30.082
- There isn't enough drama
around here without this?
- If you're over her,

13:30.149 --> 13:32.782
- then what's the problem,
and if you're not--
- Are you Cupid now?

13:32.849 --> 13:36.549
She's a great lawyer.
We all know it.
It would be a huge coup.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.549
The question goes to
all the personal stuff.

13:39.616 --> 13:41.849
Well, as questions go,
that's a good one.

13:41.916 --> 13:44.849
If you think no, fine,
but let's think first.

13:44.916 --> 13:47.582
- Hey. If-If I can handle it--
- And why would you handle it?

13:47.649 --> 13:49.849
You know, that strikes me
as a little too healthy.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.816
I'll handle it because
it makes sense to.

13:51.882 --> 13:55.216
Now that I'm partner,
I'm vested here, Bobby. I'm not
stopping at painting the walls.

13:55.282 --> 13:57.382
At least you're honest
about that.
Excuse me?

13:57.449 --> 14:00.516
First it's partner. Now
you're bringing in your friends,
building up your power nucleus.

14:00.582 --> 14:01.882
<i>Excuse me?</i>
Eugene.

14:01.949 --> 14:04.449
I like Helen Gamble,
Bobby, but--
Then what's the problem, Eugene?

14:04.516 --> 14:06.516
The problem is
she'd be in your camp.

14:06.582 --> 14:08.582
That makes me nervous.
What are you
so insecure about?

14:08.649 --> 14:10.582
I'm insecure about you not
leaving off with just paint.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.549
<i>[ Lindsay ]</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>
Both of you hold on.

14:12.616 --> 14:16.116
Eugene, you were in my office
supporting Lindsay
and her plans for growth.

14:16.182 --> 14:18.949
Supporting the idea
of growth, yes. I'm not in favor
of her taking over.

14:19.016 --> 14:21.416
Taking over?
Who do I look like, Caesar?
Her and Helen together--

14:21.482 --> 14:23.449
they'll be springing
all these power plays.
Hey!

14:23.516 --> 14:26.916
Look, she hates criminals.
You know Helen
hates criminals.

14:26.982 --> 14:30.016
I'm not gonna spend my days
reading the fine print
on stock options.

14:30.082 --> 14:32.116
Who said anything
about that?

14:33.349 --> 14:35.816
I signed up with you, Bobby.
You chauvinistic pig.

14:35.882 --> 14:38.349
<i>No wonder</i>
<i>your shirts shrink.</i>

14:40.782 --> 14:42.682
He deserved that.

14:50.349 --> 14:54.749
- Jimmy,
I think it's game over.
- What now?

14:54.816 --> 14:59.016
The victim had a one-room
studio in Brighton.
Police searched it.

14:59.082 --> 15:02.649
Turned up e-mail correspondence
from your client.

15:02.716 --> 15:05.182
We also lifted prints
that match Father Ryan's.

15:05.249 --> 15:09.582
Telephone records also show
the father called the boy
from his residence.

15:09.649 --> 15:12.349
Here's the deal.

15:12.416 --> 15:16.082
If he cooperates and confesses,
we'll go murder two.

15:17.382 --> 15:19.382
Otherwise, it's murder one
all the way.

15:21.916 --> 15:26.282
If they could make murder one,
she wouldn't offer murder two.

15:26.349 --> 15:28.982
- Agree to nothing.
- <i>[ Liquid Pours ]</i>

15:29.049 --> 15:32.649
Now, Jimmy,
this-- this father--

15:34.082 --> 15:37.382
He doesn't sound like
he's gonna "art in heaven."

15:37.449 --> 15:40.382
Bobby, it can't be.

15:40.449 --> 15:42.882
I know this guy like
I know my own mother.

15:42.949 --> 15:45.016
Look,

15:45.082 --> 15:48.549
if you kill somebody,
you're not gonna hide him
in your own office, right?

15:48.616 --> 15:51.182
I mean, there's gotta be
better ways to get away
with murder...

15:51.249 --> 15:53.282
than hanging the victim
in your own closet.

15:53.349 --> 15:56.416
Well, you're assuming
it has to make sense.

15:56.482 --> 15:58.416
I know him, Bobby.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.349
This makes no sense.

16:21.082 --> 16:23.016
Not everything is so
cut-and-dried, Ellenor.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.416
I hope you never have to be
in my shoes.

16:25.482 --> 16:27.516
Did you come in here
to lecture me?

16:27.582 --> 16:30.816
You fight in here for people
that commit homicides, but--

16:30.882 --> 16:33.716
Those people are called clients.
I don't sleep with them.
I represent them.

16:33.782 --> 16:36.482
The fact that you did
sleep with me
should count for something.

16:36.549 --> 16:38.649
Why don't you look by my faults,
for God's sake?

16:38.716 --> 16:41.282
- It's a crime!
It's not a fault!
- Yeah, it's a crime, damn it!

16:41.349 --> 16:43.149
It's a crime against
an insurance company!

16:43.216 --> 16:47.016
- If you came in here to
paint yourself as Robin Hood--
- No, I came in here to--

16:47.082 --> 16:49.716
No. People do get hurt.
People do die. Your colleagues
stage accidents,

16:49.782 --> 16:52.016
and innocent people
get killed!

16:52.082 --> 16:55.116
I have never been involved
in anything where anyone
has gotten killed!

16:55.182 --> 16:57.682
But you could be!
And you know that, Fred!

16:57.749 --> 17:00.616
How can you stand there
and pretend that this
isn't despicable?

17:03.649 --> 17:05.648
It is criminal.

17:05.715 --> 17:07.648
It is immoral.

- You're hiding something.

You either tell me what,
or I'll go to the police,
and they'll get it out of you.

18:28.616 --> 18:32.249

- Tell me.

How could I not?

20:01.665 --> 20:06.465

How moral is that?

20:06.532 --> 20:09.798
Look. I don't want to love him,

20:11.165 --> 20:13.098
but I do.

20:13.165 --> 20:15.232

And I'm telling you this
so that you don't
walk into something.

20:22.065 --> 20:24.398

walk into it either.

20:27.532 --> 20:29.432
I don't know
that I won't arrest you.

20:29.498 --> 20:31.765
- Then do it.
- All right.

20:31.832 --> 20:34.498
I think we can all agree
these are pretty extreme
circumstances.

20:34.565 --> 20:35.932
You have enough
to arrest him anyway.

20:35.998 --> 20:39.132
- Did you tell him
about Jimmy's involvement?
- No.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.632
- And he still doesn't know
Jimmy works at your firm?
- No.

<i>Yes. And I know</i>

Thank you.

Thanks.

21:28.232 --> 21:33.098
Yeah. Well, uh, some people

before their work.

21:33.165 --> 21:35.065

possessed Lindsay

making job offers.

21:43.198 --> 21:46.132
Oh, yeah.

That's what I told her.

21:46.198 --> 21:48.465
Crazy aside,

21:48.532 --> 21:50.598

He said you killed that kid!
Why would he say it?

22:05.965 --> 22:09.398

kill that kid.

You keep using the word "grow,"

Now, I like being
a criminal defense lawyer.

24:12.198 --> 24:15.698

it or not, is to phase out
criminal defense work.

24:15.765 --> 24:18.298

looking for a balance.
