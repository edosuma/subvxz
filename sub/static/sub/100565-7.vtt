WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:06.340
Did you call
the speaker of the house
a four-letter word?

00:06.374 --> 00:07.741
-No.
-Are you sure?

00:07.775 --> 00:10.378
Yes, I'm sure.
"Ass" is a three-letter word.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.826
I had to, like,
open the bruise up

00:25.859 --> 00:27.828
and let some of
the bruised blood come out

00:27.861 --> 00:30.398
to show them...

00:30.431 --> 00:32.933
I had to, like,
open the bruise up

00:32.966 --> 00:34.368
and let some
of the bruised blood

00:34.402 --> 00:35.736
come out to show them...

01:01.995 --> 01:03.197
Okay. Individual.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.400
I had to, like,
open the bruise up

01:39.433 --> 01:40.868
and let some
of the bruised blood

01:40.901 --> 01:42.470
come out to show them...

01:44.538 --> 01:46.507
I had to, like,
open the bruise up

01:46.540 --> 01:48.476
and let some
of the bruised blood

01:48.509 --> 01:50.211
come out to show them...
Come out to show them...

01:50.244 --> 01:51.945
Come out to show them...

01:51.979 --> 01:53.314
Come out to show them...
Come out to show them...

01:53.347 --> 01:55.082
Come out to show them...

01:55.115 --> 01:57.285
Come out to show them...
Come out to show them...

01:57.318 --> 01:59.420
Come out to show them...

01:59.453 --> 02:01.255
Come out to show them...

02:01.289 --> 02:02.323
Come out to show them...
Come out to show them...

02:02.356 --> 02:04.091
Come out to show them...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.093
Come out to show them...
Come out to show them...

02:06.126 --> 02:07.928
Come out to show them...

02:07.961 --> 02:10.063
Come out to show them...
Come out to show them...

02:10.097 --> 02:12.166
Come out to show, show...

02:12.200 --> 02:14.602
Come out to show, show...
Come out to show, show...

02:14.635 --> 02:17.104
Come out to show, show...

02:17.137 --> 02:19.106
Show, show, show, show, show...

02:44.298 --> 02:45.766
So...

02:45.799 --> 02:47.901
Don't.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.037
Don't what?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.308
Just...

03:01.014 --> 03:02.683
...let it be normal.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.085
This?

03:05.118 --> 03:06.954
Yes.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.222
Normal.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.990
Yeah.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.860
Okay.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
I can do normal.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.777
So what about the dishwasher?

03:34.382 --> 03:36.384
What about the dishwasher?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.888
Did it get emptied last night?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.823
I'm not-I'm not trying to make a
big deal or anything, you know,

03:42.856 --> 03:44.558
I just...

03:44.592 --> 03:46.026
You did say
you were gonna do it,

03:46.059 --> 03:47.728
and I did it
the night before, so...

03:47.761 --> 03:49.763
Uh, excuse me.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.866
I walked the dog.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.369
You were gonna
empty the dishwasher.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.405
We have a dog?

03:58.806 --> 04:00.808
We don't have a dog.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.376
We have a cat.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.378
Mm.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.879
So you walked the cat?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.281
Yeah.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.317
Yeah, okay, well, good.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.519
Because the cat's
not gonna walk itself.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.690
-Can you see Daddy?
-We can discuss this

05:22.723 --> 05:24.725
-in, like, 30 seconds.
-I know we can

05:24.758 --> 05:27.060
discuss it in 30 seconds.
We can also discuss it now.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.062
No, I'm hanging up.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.631
You know I hate
talking and driving.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.666
You can't wait 30 seconds?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.379
We could go further back.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.381
Further than a billion years?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.083
We don't need to.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.618
It works.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.321
Why don't I feel good about it?

07:01.354 --> 07:05.092
That would be your unconscious
mind speaking to you.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.895
And what it's saying is,
"Uh-oh."

07:09.463 --> 07:12.299
Because a few hours ago,
we were in reality

07:12.332 --> 07:14.334
and we were working on a sim.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.239
And now we've
pretty much traded.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.876
That's the reality.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.013
Right there.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.423
It's not even a clone
of reality.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.126
The box contains everything.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.462
It doesn't contain us.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.602
One-second projection.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.688
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit.

08:12.893 --> 08:16.664
-What the fuck, Stewart?
-What the fuck, Stewart?

08:16.697 --> 08:19.332
-That's messed up.
-That's messed up.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.039
-Switch it off.
-Switch it off.

08:35.382 --> 08:38.118
The box contains us.

08:38.151 --> 08:41.121
The box contains everything.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.124
And inside the box

08:44.157 --> 08:47.127
there's another box.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.163
Ad infinitum, ad nauseam.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.068
Uh-oh.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.289
Hey.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.992
Yeah.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.431
I think I'll go.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.601
I know.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.771
We both know.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.807
We both know this particular day
inside and out.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.408
Forwards and backwards.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.878
Up to a point.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.580
Right.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.055
Okay.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.262
-I'll see you there.
-Yeah.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.698
Remember, Lyndon's in your car.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.933
There's that whole thing.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.468
Sure.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.257
Hi, Lyndon.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.526
Shit.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.264
Uh, sorry.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.435
Uh, I was...

10:35.468 --> 10:36.970
asleep.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.607
Um...

10:43.210 --> 10:45.779
I really need
to talk to you, Katie.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.682
And I thought you might be here.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.086
Just give me a chance
and hear me out, please.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.822
And I-I know you
have to get to work,

10:54.855 --> 10:58.125
but we could drive up 280
and find somewhere to stop.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.098
Maybe Crystal Springs Dam?

11:05.132 --> 11:06.633
It's right on the way.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.005
Sure, Lyndon.
We'll do that.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.377
Cool.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.552
Lils.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.159
Are we leaving normality?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.161
Yeah.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.697
Only for a moment, though.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.407
I want to know.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.944
What's our plan?

12:25.946 --> 12:28.415
Last night, you asked

12:28.448 --> 12:30.450
what was on their mind.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.253
And I said madness.

12:43.530 --> 12:47.034
They're having the tech nerd's
wettest dream.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.238
The one that reduces everything

12:51.271 --> 12:53.606
to nothing.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.209
Nothing but...

12:56.243 --> 12:58.245
code.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.448
What does that mean?

13:01.481 --> 13:05.285
It means they believe
everything is computational.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.288
And of course, they've cracked
the encryption key

13:08.321 --> 13:10.323
to compute it.

13:11.825 --> 13:15.295
So everything is unpackable...

13:15.328 --> 13:17.998
and packable.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.401
And reverse-engineerable.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.936
And predictable.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.940
Stars.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.776
Planets.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.811
Dust.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.015
Us.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.253
Me.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.258
You know the problem with the
people who run tech companies?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.160
They have too much power.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.929
It drives them crazy.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.298
They end up thinking
they're messiahs.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.805
Sometime after midnight,

13:58.838 --> 14:02.142
they think I'm gonna go to Devs.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.345
And they think
I'm gonna do something

14:05.378 --> 14:07.948
that folds into their plan.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.983
But I'm gonna fuck them up.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.021
I'm gonna contradict
their prediction.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
They say I'm gonna go to Devs.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.896
So all I have to do is not go.

14:25.398 --> 14:29.002
We fuck 'em up by hanging out
in your apartment for a day?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.704
Yeah.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.844
I'd sort of
mentally prepped myself

14:37.877 --> 14:39.846
for a high-speed police chase

14:39.879 --> 14:41.881
and 20 years in jail, but...

14:43.650 --> 14:45.585
...okay.

14:45.618 --> 14:48.155
Let's try your way.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.294
Do you want me to pretend
I don't know what happens next?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.264
So you've watched this before.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.668
Breaking your own rules, Katie.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.704
That's why you're cool.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.874
Why didn't you
look into the future?

15:41.908 --> 15:43.910
You could have.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.379
Why ask a question

15:46.413 --> 15:48.748
when you've already
heard the answer?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.721
I didn't want
to know the future,

15:54.754 --> 15:56.756
it's not that strange.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.727
While I have the illusion
of free will,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.462
I have the illusion
of free will.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.669
You know he's wrong.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.306
I... And I don't blame him.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.209
I never liked the Everett
interpretation either.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.279
I liked Penrose or pilot-wave.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.982
But it turns out
that Everett was right.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.820
The many worlds are real.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.789
You're right, Lyndon.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.824
I do know he's wrong.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.029
-You do?
-Yes.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.831
-Then why haven't you said?
-You don't understand.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.333
I don't understand what?

16:40.367 --> 16:44.137
You're here to argue
for your job back.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.706
To ask me to appeal to Forest
on your behalf,

16:46.739 --> 16:49.342
but the...
the conversation you planned

16:49.376 --> 16:50.877
isn't how this plays out.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.980
It isn't?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.518
No.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.521
A few moments from now...

17:01.554 --> 17:04.457
you climb over this rail.

17:04.491 --> 17:08.261
You stand on the other side
and balance there,

17:08.295 --> 17:10.963
right on the edge of the dam.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.965
Just your toes on the concrete,

17:12.999 --> 17:15.668
arms outstretched,
not holding the rail.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.471
What?

17:18.505 --> 17:21.308
Whether you stay balanced
or fall depends on

17:21.341 --> 17:24.844
quantum variations of the air
around you, the wind.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.046
I'm not following,
why the fuck would I do that?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.548
It's an act of faith.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.049
Or belief.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.984
In what?

17:32.018 --> 17:34.521
Exactly what you just said.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.922
In many worlds.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.026
If you believe in it,
you know there will be worlds

17:40.059 --> 17:42.329
in which you fall.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.863
And worlds in which you don't.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.966
But you'll only be conscious
of the worlds

17:46.999 --> 17:48.968
in which you remain alive.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.806
And the worlds
in which I remain alive...

17:55.608 --> 17:58.911
...are the worlds in which
I'm allowed back into Devs?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.947
That's the idea.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.086
Uh, s-so you're saying

18:07.120 --> 18:10.723
I demonstrate my total belief
in the multiverse?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.395
Like a mystic
walking over burning coals.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.432
Yes.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.371
Would I climb the rail
if you hadn't told me?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.239
I did tell you.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.413
Do you see me fall?

18:34.481 --> 18:37.517
I've watched us here many times

18:37.550 --> 18:39.552
and I never
answer that question.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.456
Why?

18:43.490 --> 18:47.227
If I tell you you don't fall,
it negates your act of belief.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.263
A mystic walking
over unlit coals.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.102
Whoa.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.140
Whoa.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.478
I get it.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.848
It's a perfect circle.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.189
Oh, shit.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.359
That's elegant.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.428
That's fucking beautiful.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.801
I love it.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.837
Yeah.
You do.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.944
Okay, so when do I do it?
When do I climb over?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.946
-Now.
-Now?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.981
Fuck.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.720
Fuck!

20:01.067 --> 20:02.569
Okay.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.082
Jesus Christ.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.117
My heart is pounding
out of my fucking chest.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.857
You really aren't gonna tell me
if you see me fall or not?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.726
No.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.597
This is intense.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.935
Ooh...

21:08.267 --> 21:10.236
"I work all day

21:10.269 --> 21:12.639
"and get half drunk at night.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.243
"Waking at four
to soundless dark,

21:17.276 --> 21:19.446
"I stare.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.214
"In time, the curtain-edges
will grow light.

21:23.850 --> 21:27.554
"Till then I see
what's always really there:

21:29.088 --> 21:30.957
"unresting death.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.069
"The mind blanks
at the glare.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.272
"Not in remorse,
the good not done,

21:46.305 --> 21:47.574
"the love not given,

21:47.607 --> 21:51.411
"time torn off unused.

21:51.444 --> 21:54.947
"But at the total emptiness
forever,

21:56.516 --> 21:59.886
"the sure extinction
that we travel to,

21:59.919 --> 22:03.656
"and shall be lost in always.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.758
"Not to be here,

22:05.792 --> 22:08.495
"not to be anywhere,

22:08.528 --> 22:09.829
"and soon.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.433
"Nothing more terrible,

22:13.466 --> 22:16.335
"nothing more true.

22:16.369 --> 22:19.672
"This is a special way
of being afraid.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.775
"No trick dispels.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.844
"Religion used to try,

22:24.877 --> 22:27.980
"that vast moth-eaten
musical brocade,

22:28.014 --> 22:30.983
"created to pretend
we never die.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.185
"And specious stuff that says

22:33.219 --> 22:35.588
"no rational being
can fear a thing

22:35.622 --> 22:37.990
"it will not feel.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.026
"Not seeing that

22:40.059 --> 22:43.029
"this is what we fear,

22:43.062 --> 22:45.798
"no sight, no sound,

22:45.832 --> 22:49.335
"no touch or taste or smell.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.871
"Nothing to think with,

22:51.904 --> 22:55.542
"nothing to love
or link with,

22:55.575 --> 22:58.711
"the anesthetic from which

22:58.745 --> 23:02.582
"none come round.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.551
"And so it stays

23:04.584 --> 23:08.054
"just on the edge of vision,

23:08.087 --> 23:12.024
"a small unfocused blur,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.826
"a standing chill

23:13.860 --> 23:15.995
"that slows each impulse

23:16.028 --> 23:19.398
"down to indecision.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.770
"Most things will never happen:

23:26.038 --> 23:27.707
this one will."

23:31.410 --> 23:33.412
I like the acoustics here.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.119
Who was that?

23:41.287 --> 23:42.789
Guess.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.395
You know, Forest,
I don't mind

23:49.428 --> 23:51.397
that you don't know
who I was quoting,

23:51.430 --> 23:54.834
but I do mind
that you can't even guess.

23:59.572 --> 24:03.109
Such big decisions
being made about our future

24:03.142 --> 24:06.946
by people who know
so little about our past.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.619
Isn't knowing our past

24:12.652 --> 24:15.121
exactly what we're doing here?

24:15.154 --> 24:18.157
No, it isn't.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.995
The Devs system now works.

24:24.430 --> 24:25.898
What do you mean?

24:25.932 --> 24:28.267
It works.
Fully. Totally.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.570
As of a few hours ago.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.705
Want to hear Antony
talking to Cleopatra?

24:32.739 --> 24:34.774
You can.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.442
Want to see dinosaurs?

24:36.475 --> 24:38.244
The formation
of the solar system?

24:38.277 --> 24:39.746
You can.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.247
No distortion.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.949
Drop-out zero.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.451
It flat-out fucking works.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.827
What did you do?

24:55.862 --> 24:57.664
Ignored you.

24:57.697 --> 25:00.099
I ignored you. We ignored you.
All of us.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.168
Followed Lyndon's principle.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.837
Made the system
based on the universe as it is,

25:04.871 --> 25:06.873
not your restricted obsessions.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.845
Forest.

25:12.879 --> 25:15.181
Who was Mark Antony?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.716
Guess.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.522
Guess.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.711
Can you bring me
a glass of water too, please?

27:58.745 --> 28:00.747
Sure.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.556
Bitch.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.655
Adeen, dva,

30:56.688 --> 30:59.959
tree, chityri,

30:59.992 --> 31:02.561
pyat, shest,

31:02.594 --> 31:05.497
syem, vosim,

31:05.531 --> 31:08.767
dyevit...

32:29.415 --> 32:31.017
Lily,

32:31.050 --> 32:33.519
I need you to go
sit on the couch for me, okay?

34:07.113 --> 34:09.148
You were counting in Russian.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.322
You were with the man I met
by the bridge.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.132
And Sergei.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.776
My orders...

34:39.278 --> 34:43.048
were to watch and protect him,
if I could.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.585
And then my orders were...

34:47.886 --> 34:49.388
...to watch you.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.091
But not protect.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.395
But I've seen your courage.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.500
How you fought and fought.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.471
And I couldn't
let Kenton kill you.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.708
That was not an order.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.878
It was a choice.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.149
And now it's a problem.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.185
For both of us.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.893
There are two dead bodies
in your apartment.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.429
American citizens.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.598
Something like this--
it cannot be hidden.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.100
It can only be denied.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.770
So my side will deny it.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.507
And I will disappear.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.909
This works for me.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.178
But it doesn't work for you.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.682
So now we need
to talk about your options.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.953
You can go to the CIA.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.489
Not the police, not the FBI.
The CIA.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.090
They're the only organization

35:59.124 --> 36:00.992
that can make sense
of what has happened here.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.229
But you will be pulled
into their world

36:03.262 --> 36:05.297
of interrogations and process.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.832
It could go on for years.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.902
Or...

36:10.936 --> 36:12.538
you leave for the airport.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.340
Immediately.

36:14.373 --> 36:18.109
You carry a passport,
some money, a phone...

36:18.143 --> 36:21.012
and you board
the first flight to Hong Kong.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.716
There's no extradition there.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.518
You stay with your mother.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.289
But you can never come home.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.165
I have to go.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.442
I'm sorry
about what happened to you.

36:50.476 --> 36:53.345
But the most important thing
is you understand

36:53.379 --> 36:56.382
the life you once had is gone.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.286
The choice you have

37:00.319 --> 37:02.288
is about the life you have next.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.893
What is this?

37:44.262 --> 37:47.566
A painting in a cave system
in France.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.937
How old are we watching?

37:53.271 --> 37:55.273
Little over 30,000 years.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.447
I spoke with Stewart
on the way in.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.450
I saw him too.

38:04.483 --> 38:05.984
In the tunnel.

38:07.453 --> 38:10.088
He's quoting Shakespeare
or something.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.225
So that's who it was.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.940
You know it's us, in caves.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.743
Homo sapiens.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.513
Same species.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.186
I found this little girl
with a dog.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.357
That's nice.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.027
I mean it.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.007
Us, right?

39:03.875 --> 39:05.577
Yeah.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.113
I watched her for a while.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.115
Some of her life.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.983
She had five children.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.453
Died in her early 30s.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.789
You know it's strange?

39:17.823 --> 39:19.825
Her people-- our people--

39:19.858 --> 39:22.828
didn't live in caves
for decades or centuries.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.330
It was millennia.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.766
I've been checking
through the timelines.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.736
Some of the wall paintings
are 5,000 years apart.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.940
5,000 years.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.942
In the same place.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.411
Making the same images.

39:43.915 --> 39:47.252
How could nothing
have changed in so much time?

39:53.525 --> 39:56.728
When I was a kid, the world
changed every few years.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.731
These days...

39:59.765 --> 40:02.568
it changes every few months.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.603
Sometimes every few hours.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.909
Such acceleration.

40:16.047 --> 40:18.049
Maybe it stops tonight.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.086
Maybe it does.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.091
How long have we got?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.430
Lily will still be at home.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.466
She leaves in about ten minutes.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.171
What do we do?

40:40.205 --> 40:42.708
We watch dinosaurs.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.777
And then you make a joke

40:45.811 --> 40:48.413
about it not being as good
as Jurassic Park.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.919
Then we end up watching
some of your old home movies.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.924
Sounds okay.

41:06.431 --> 41:07.933
It is okay.

45:49.180 --> 45:51.682
Hey, I got someone
heading towards Devs.

45:53.018 --> 45:54.853
She's on the system
as an employee,

45:54.886 --> 45:57.222
but I got no record
of her at Devs clearance.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.424
And the system's showing her
as code green?

46:00.926 --> 46:02.427
Direct from the boss?

46:03.728 --> 46:05.396
Copy that.
Letting her through.

47:34.319 --> 47:35.987
I don't know you.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.625
You haven't been here before.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.196
No.

47:46.231 --> 47:47.732
What's your name?

47:52.603 --> 47:55.406
-Lily.
-Lily.

47:58.143 --> 48:00.645
You seem like a nice young girl.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.649
I think you should turn around.

48:07.218 --> 48:10.021
This place
will not be good for you.

48:10.055 --> 48:12.890
It's not good for anybody.

48:15.493 --> 48:17.728
What's inside?

48:18.763 --> 48:20.265
Everything.

48:22.733 --> 48:25.336
Everything is inside.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.277
I don't think I can turn around.

48:34.779 --> 48:36.281
Well...

48:38.849 --> 48:41.219
...if you can't, you can't.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.155
That is the truth.

48:59.070 --> 49:00.571
That way.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.353
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

52:05.623 --> 52:06.691
What is Devs?

52:09.126 --> 52:10.361
What is Devs?

52:10.395 --> 52:11.796
What is Devs?

52:12.897 --> 52:14.465
What is Devs?

52:15.333 --> 52:16.501
What is Devs?

52:17.268 --> 52:18.603
What is Devs?

52:18.636 --> 52:21.038
-What is Devs?

52:35.286 --> 52:37.755
Mummy! Mummy!

52:37.788 --> 52:40.325
Mummy isn't here.
Try next door.

52:40.358 --> 52:41.592
Mummy!

52:41.626 --> 52:44.862
Oh, my God.
No, got the wrong house.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.332
Another.

52:49.467 --> 52:51.135
-Ooh, ooh, ooh.

52:53.003 --> 52:54.305
-Text me.
-Nope.

53:02.547 --> 53:03.848
-Mom.
-Yes?

53:03.881 --> 53:06.284
-Okay. I want
a big party this year.
-Serious?

53:06.317 --> 53:08.519
-I want a quinceañera.
-Quinceañera?

53:08.553 --> 53:11.922
We can't do that.
We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.

53:18.329 --> 53:21.332
Looks like one
of my codpieces.

53:21.366 --> 53:23.701
-Except not as big.

53:23.734 --> 53:26.537
What are you waiting for?
Take your instrument,
use my body

53:26.571 --> 53:28.739
and perform your special
blood ritual.

53:28.773 --> 53:31.309
Kyle.

53:37.081 --> 53:38.082
Hey!
