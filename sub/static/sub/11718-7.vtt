00:23.923 --> 00:25.023
I think we should go home.

Just, uh, just a
little longer, babe.

00:27.754 --> 00:29.704
I'll protect you.

00:29.756 --> 00:32.506
Wow. I feel super safe now.

You hear that?

<i>Kulamanu Heiau,</i> a...

an ancient temple and-and...

a sacred graveyard.

01:17.420 --> 01:19.971
Locals, uh, consider trespassing

onto the grounds taboo.

01:22.058 --> 01:23.725
There, uh...

01:23.792 --> 01:26.961
there have been many sightings
of the Night Marchers up here,

01:27.013 --> 01:30.732

01:30.799 --> 01:32.317
the spirits protecting

01:32.401 --> 01:35.103
this <i>heiau,</i>
it's worth the risk.

How about six

Daddy, let's just go.

No, it's fine.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.271
She hates that hotel.

04:58.338 --> 05:00.006
I have got to find
an apartment.

05:00.090 --> 05:01.641
STEVE: Well, you've found
ten apartments, Danny--

05:01.725 --> 05:02.842
none are good enough.

05:02.926 --> 05:05.011
It's called taste
and standards, buddy.

05:05.095 --> 05:06.312
Go home!

05:06.396 --> 05:07.813
I'd like to.
Thank you.

05:07.898 --> 05:09.815
You're forbidden
to be here.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.818
Just like New Jersey.
Sleep it off, buddy, huh?

05:12.903 --> 05:14.153
Hey, guys.

05:14.237 --> 05:17.123
So, we think there are two
vics buried up the trail--

05:17.190 --> 05:19.808
Christian O'Connor
and Kat Forester.

05:19.860 --> 05:22.828
Two amateur documentarians who
were trying to film the Night Marchers.

05:22.913 --> 05:24.580
What are the
Night Marchers?

05:24.647 --> 05:26.916
- Hawaiian ghost warriors.
- Yeah.

05:26.983 --> 05:29.302
Oh, so good,
so we have our suspects.

05:29.369 --> 05:30.870
- You know what?
- Hey, don't laugh.

05:30.937 --> 05:32.238
My grandfather
saw them once.

05:32.306 --> 05:33.506
Saw the...?

05:33.573 --> 05:34.490
Yeah.

05:34.541 --> 05:35.824
- Hey, Kono.
- Yeah?

05:35.825 --> 05:38.174
- Who found the bodies?
- Roommate. Over there.

05:38.211 --> 05:40.579
She, uh, was supposed to meet
them but she was running late,

05:40.647 --> 05:42.498
and by the time
she got up there,

05:42.549 --> 05:43.933
they were already
dead and buried.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.885
And technically, she
didn't find the bodies,

05:45.969 --> 05:49.055
so much as a hand sticking out
of a shallow grave. Spooky.

05:49.139 --> 05:49.895
Where's Weston?

05:49.920 --> 05:51.342
Oh, she was, uh,
she had to change

05:51.692 --> 05:53.008
into something
more appropriate.

05:53.060 --> 05:54.560
DANNY: Meaning she
was wearing

05:54.644 --> 05:55.945
something <i>inappropriate?</i>

05:56.012 --> 05:59.014
No, no, no, uh,
that's not what I said.

05:59.066 --> 06:01.200
That's kind of
what you said.

06:01.284 --> 06:02.902
Oh, she was wearing a costume?

06:02.986 --> 06:04.236
Please don't tell
her I told you.

06:04.304 --> 06:05.521
You didn't tell me;
I guessed.

06:05.572 --> 06:06.706
Yeah.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.023
Hi.
Right.

06:08.075 --> 06:10.076
Okay, let's
get started.

06:15.165 --> 06:16.465
Oh, you told them.

06:16.533 --> 06:17.833
They guessed.

06:17.884 --> 06:19.218
(sighs):
Okay.

06:19.302 --> 06:20.586
Oh, this is fascinating.

06:20.670 --> 06:23.139
I was at a Halloween
party with...

06:23.206 --> 06:24.757
What's so fascinating?

06:24.841 --> 06:25.975
The party isn't fascinating--
what's fascinating

06:26.042 --> 06:28.043
is that you're not willing
to tell us about it.

06:28.095 --> 06:30.363
You're kind of being all secretive--
isn't that kind of weird?

06:30.430 --> 06:31.931
Weird? Really?

06:32.015 --> 06:34.316
I'm not secretive. No,
it's just my private life.

06:34.384 --> 06:35.234
And I can have a private life.
Yeah.

06:35.318 --> 06:36.718
Like you all have.

06:36.770 --> 06:37.770
Why are you staring at me?

06:37.854 --> 06:40.189
I... Because
I am just imagining,

06:40.240 --> 06:44.243
uh, who Lori Weston's
alter ego might be.

06:44.327 --> 06:45.478
Uh...

06:45.545 --> 06:47.413
mm, Wonder Woman?

06:47.497 --> 06:48.547
No.

06:48.615 --> 06:50.149
(clears throat)

06:50.217 --> 06:51.817
Slutty Wonder Woman?

06:51.885 --> 06:53.902
Stop it, Danno.

07:02.245 --> 07:05.181
STEVE:
Chin, what have you got?

07:05.248 --> 07:06.766
A search of the
surrounding area

07:06.850 --> 07:08.300
hasn't turned up
anything yet.

07:09.886 --> 07:12.304
DANNY: Hm. Okay, I don't want
to state the obvious,

07:12.389 --> 07:14.590
but I just think that
maybe we'll do better

07:14.641 --> 07:15.582
if we look where the hand is.

07:15.607 --> 07:17.238
Yeah, but we have
to wait for the priest.

07:17.861 --> 07:19.779
- Why?
- 'Cause this is a <i>heiau.</i>

07:19.863 --> 07:22.314
An ancient Hawaiian temple.
We have to wait for the <i>Kahu</i>

07:22.399 --> 07:25.201
to bless us and ask for the spirits'
permission before we can enter.

07:25.268 --> 07:26.869
Oh.

07:26.936 --> 07:29.183
Okay, well, I just,
let me just get this

07:29.184 --> 07:30.739
straight so I understand.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.992
There's a crime scene
right there.

07:33.076 --> 07:34.410
All right, and forensic
evidence is degrading

07:34.461 --> 07:35.995
as we speak, <i>but</i>
we are gonna wait

07:36.079 --> 07:37.580
for a priest to tell us...

07:37.631 --> 07:40.449
that the magic ghost says it's
okay for us to check it out.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.169
Mm-hmm. It's their culture, Danny--
you just have to respect it.

07:43.253 --> 07:45.221
Oh, that's a-a beautiful
thought, Wonder Woman,

07:45.288 --> 07:47.640
<i>but</i> I think the spirits
will make an exception

07:47.724 --> 07:49.458
so that we can catch
a murderer, no?

07:49.509 --> 07:51.627
(sighs) Really?
Gloves are going on?

07:51.678 --> 07:53.312
You're making a mistake.

07:53.396 --> 07:55.147
Well, I think
I'll take my chances.

07:55.232 --> 07:56.565
KONO:
They're gonna be here soon.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.234
I got it, all right?

08:07.244 --> 08:09.161
A woven leather bracelet...

08:09.279 --> 08:11.363
The roommate identified
as the male victim's.

08:11.448 --> 08:14.283
A lot of footprints.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.421
Ah. Everybody...

08:19.489 --> 08:23.042
I have found an ancient
Hawaiian artifact.

08:24.878 --> 08:26.712
Look at that.

08:26.796 --> 08:27.997
Huh?

08:28.064 --> 08:30.549
Maybe they got a picture
of their killer.

08:30.634 --> 08:34.636
Uh, evil spirits, they gonna
come and curse me now, or what?

08:39.275 --> 08:41.110
Do <i>not.</i>

08:42.511 --> 08:44.697
You should've waited
for the priest, buddy.

08:46.650 --> 08:48.367
Shut up.

08:56.076 --> 08:58.127
Well, because it says
utilities included, okay?

08:58.194 --> 08:59.378
And everybody knows

08:59.462 --> 09:01.029
that satellite television
is a utility.

09:01.081 --> 09:02.414
No?

09:02.499 --> 09:05.251
Well, a good day to you, sir.

09:05.335 --> 09:09.305
(sighs) You're out of
your mind, Danny.

09:09.372 --> 09:12.474
Listen, I-I've lived in
squalor for way too long.

09:12.542 --> 09:13.926
Okay? I'm gonna get what I want,

09:14.010 --> 09:15.594
I'm gonna get want
at a reasonable price,

09:15.679 --> 09:17.546
and I'm not gonna pay
any moving fees, okay?

09:17.597 --> 09:18.814
That does not make me crazy.

09:18.881 --> 09:21.100
No, what makes you crazy
is thinking it's okay

09:21.184 --> 09:22.936
to trample all over
a sacred burial ground.

09:22.961 --> 09:24.153
Oh, here we go.

09:24.154 --> 09:25.437
- Here we go.
- Here we go?

09:25.522 --> 09:27.940
I am an insensitive jerk.
I didn't say a jerk,

09:28.024 --> 09:29.391
but "insensitive" is
accurate, yeah, Danny.

09:29.442 --> 09:32.027
It was a murder scene, Steven.

09:32.078 --> 09:33.445
Yeah, you know what?

09:33.513 --> 09:36.231
You cannot treat people's
beliefs like a joke.

09:36.283 --> 09:38.050
Danny, a <i>heiau</i> is an
incredibly important part

09:38.075 --> 09:39.275
of Hawaiian culture.

09:39.619 --> 09:42.254
Okay, and investigating a crime
scene is very important to my job.

09:42.339 --> 09:44.673
Right, and if you want
HPD to cooperate with us,

09:44.741 --> 09:46.926
you can't disrespect
their religion, man.

09:47.010 --> 09:49.261
How would you feel if
somebody desecrated a church.

09:49.346 --> 09:51.263
I personally would care,
I would care, okay?

09:51.348 --> 09:53.165
But that's a good question,
because guess what?

09:53.233 --> 09:54.433
It's not the same thing.

09:54.517 --> 09:56.468
It's exactly the same thing.

09:56.553 --> 09:59.438
But you don't believe in any of
that anyway, right? You don't...

09:59.522 --> 10:00.922
Could we please not have
this conversation?

10:00.974 --> 10:01.941
Because generally,
this conversation

10:02.025 --> 10:03.108
doesn't go very well.

10:03.193 --> 10:03.976
- Good.
- 'Kay?

10:04.060 --> 10:05.611
In history, it doesn't go well.

10:05.695 --> 10:07.479
Okay, fine.

10:08.865 --> 10:11.933
Good. I mean, no afterlife,
no higher power.

10:11.985 --> 10:13.569
- No nothing.
- Okay, okay, okay.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.487
I think that people
make stuff up

10:15.572 --> 10:17.740
to make themselves feel better.
How's that?

10:20.794 --> 10:22.044
Wow.

10:22.111 --> 10:23.329
Don't "wow" me.

10:23.396 --> 10:25.214
I'm... no, I mean it's just...

10:25.281 --> 10:26.665
Wow.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.635
Okay, listen, okay, I believe
what I see in front of my face,

10:29.719 --> 10:31.453
and sometimes,
I don't even believe that, okay,

10:31.504 --> 10:33.222
but if it makes you feel
any better,

10:33.289 --> 10:36.058
next time, I will pretend, okay?

10:37.577 --> 10:38.844
STEVE:
Wow.

10:38.928 --> 10:41.180
DANNY:
Don't "wow" me!

10:43.132 --> 10:45.050
STEVE:
<i>Chin,</i>

10:45.118 --> 10:46.485
anything?

10:46.553 --> 10:48.754
Well, the camera was recording
when the murders took place,

10:48.822 --> 10:50.806
but it looks like
our killer was camera shy.

10:50.857 --> 10:52.191
Not a single shot of him.

10:52.275 --> 10:53.575
But we did find
something interesting.

10:53.643 --> 10:54.727
Look at this.

10:54.794 --> 10:56.195
(owl hooting)

10:56.279 --> 10:59.698
...it's worth the risk.

10:59.783 --> 11:02.201
KAT:
What is this?

11:04.871 --> 11:06.505
CHRISTIAN:
Hey, maybe, uh...

11:06.589 --> 11:07.873
Hey, maybe you shouldn't, uh...

11:07.957 --> 11:10.709
(Kat screams)

11:12.262 --> 11:13.379
KONO:
That bag...

11:13.463 --> 11:14.830
wasn't at the scene.

11:14.881 --> 11:16.765
(computer chirps on,
Kat screams)

11:16.833 --> 11:19.668
Christian!
(Christian gasps)

11:19.719 --> 11:22.755
(Kat screaming)

11:22.822 --> 11:24.990
Yeah, I wonder what the hell
was in that bag?

11:25.058 --> 11:27.026
There's a lot of ancient
skeletal remains up there.

11:27.110 --> 11:28.777
Wait a minute.
You think grave robbers?

11:28.845 --> 11:31.280
Could be. Some unscrupulous
collectors would pay a lot

11:31.347 --> 11:33.532
for the artifacts
up there.

11:33.616 --> 11:36.201
Okay, so,
these two kids surprise him,

11:36.286 --> 11:39.238
and he kills them 'cause
he wants to keep his secret.

11:39.322 --> 11:40.572
STEVE:
Maybe.

11:40.657 --> 11:42.074
There could be something
in this section.

11:42.158 --> 11:44.410
Something the camera picked up
that we can't see right now.

11:44.494 --> 11:46.128
Kono, have Fong
dig through this,

11:46.195 --> 11:47.195
see what he can come up with.

11:47.247 --> 11:48.714
Danny and I are gonna go
and talk to Max.

11:48.798 --> 11:52.251
The female vic died of blunt
force trauma to the head,

11:52.318 --> 11:55.754
mostly likely killed by
the very shovel that buried her.

11:55.822 --> 11:58.590
The male victim had dirt
and debris in his lungs.

11:58.675 --> 12:01.009
Unfortunately,
he was buried alive.

12:01.061 --> 12:03.762
You know, uh, Keanu,
Halloween was yesterday.

12:03.847 --> 12:05.097
You're aware
of that, right?

12:05.181 --> 12:06.565
- What?
- Hmm?

12:06.633 --> 12:09.485
Oh. Yes, I came directly
to work after a costume party.

12:09.552 --> 12:11.653
Ah, you don't secretly
have this thing

12:11.721 --> 12:14.273
where you love dressing up
like you're in <i>The Matrix?</i>

12:14.357 --> 12:16.108
The two concepts are not
mutually exclusive.

12:16.176 --> 12:19.227
All right, Max, what do we,
uh... what do we got here?

12:19.279 --> 12:22.364
Well, I have some good news
and... weird news.

12:22.415 --> 12:24.333
Take a look at this.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.669
See the marks under her right
eye-- fingerprint bruising.

12:27.737 --> 12:29.455
Okay, he grabbed her face.

12:29.539 --> 12:33.008
Exactly, and when he did that,
he very kindly left a print.

12:33.075 --> 12:35.961
A nice one on the right lens.

12:36.045 --> 12:37.513
I ran it through the system,

12:37.580 --> 12:38.797
and found a match.

12:38.882 --> 12:41.082
Man by the name
of Greg Straithan.

12:41.134 --> 12:42.751
- Oh.
DANNY: Nice work, Max.

12:42.802 --> 12:44.103
I'm impressed.

12:44.187 --> 12:45.587
And now the weird news.

12:45.638 --> 12:47.973
Our suspect, Greg Straithan...

12:48.057 --> 12:50.058
is dead.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.784
KONO:
Greg Straithan--

12:59.852 --> 13:00.986
nice long sheet.

13:01.037 --> 13:03.405
Burglary two,
criminal trespass, did

13:03.489 --> 13:05.991
three years at Chino in
California for assault.

13:06.042 --> 13:07.876
Looks good for
our suspect.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.194
Except for the part where
he's not actually alive.

13:10.246 --> 13:11.379
How did he die?

13:11.464 --> 13:12.881
Shot and killed
in his apartment last week.

13:12.965 --> 13:15.283
His girlfriend, Nikki Royce,
admitted to it.

13:15.351 --> 13:17.135
LORI: She's got a history of mental
illness. They've got her

13:17.202 --> 13:18.420
on a psych hold
at Okalani hospital.

13:18.504 --> 13:21.423
Okay, this says she
shot him in the face.

13:21.507 --> 13:22.974
Yeah, with a shotgun.

13:23.042 --> 13:24.976
Okay, so, no dental records.

13:25.044 --> 13:26.978
Right? No face to identify him.

13:27.046 --> 13:29.047
With the girlfriend's
confession,

13:29.098 --> 13:30.765
I'm pretty sure they didn't

13:30.850 --> 13:32.100
print the body.

13:32.184 --> 13:33.818
- What are you getting at?
- It just seems

13:33.886 --> 13:35.070
like a really good way
to fake your own death.

13:35.137 --> 13:36.054
That is, unless
you think

13:36.105 --> 13:37.221
a dead person

13:37.273 --> 13:38.773
slapped our victim
in the face.

13:38.858 --> 13:39.941
Okay, if that's the case,

13:40.026 --> 13:41.392
the girlfriend
was definitely in on it,

13:41.444 --> 13:42.777
right, so let's go talk to her.

13:42.862 --> 13:44.079
Lori, I could use
your profiling skills

13:44.163 --> 13:45.246
to determine if she's crazy,

13:45.331 --> 13:46.531
or just acting crazy.
All right.

13:46.582 --> 13:47.999
You know, there's a big question

13:48.067 --> 13:49.250
that we haven't asked yet.

13:49.335 --> 13:50.752
Somebody got shot
at Straithan's apartment.

13:50.836 --> 13:52.287
So, if not him, then who?

13:52.371 --> 13:54.339
Whoever it is, he's buried
in Straithan's grave.

13:54.406 --> 13:56.091
I'll get the paperwork started
for an exhumation.

13:56.175 --> 13:58.176
Okay, in the meantime,
if Straithan is alive,

13:58.243 --> 14:00.295
and he's been walking
around all week,

14:00.379 --> 14:02.464
maybe our victims had
some prior interactions.

14:02.531 --> 14:05.016
So, Kono, see if the roommate
recognizes him, okay?

14:05.084 --> 14:09.187
I've never seen him.
Sorry.

14:10.606 --> 14:11.639
Do you think

14:11.724 --> 14:13.358
he did it?

14:13.425 --> 14:15.393
He's, uh, someone
we're looking into.

14:18.030 --> 14:19.814
How are you handling all this?

14:19.899 --> 14:22.150
Oh, you know.

14:22.234 --> 14:24.069
Not great.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.989
The worst part is, I lost both
my roommates, and I'm all alone.

14:29.241 --> 14:31.326
I've never lived
by myself before.

14:32.712 --> 14:36.131
Yeah. So your-your friends--
they, uh...

14:36.215 --> 14:39.283
they never told you
about anyone threatening them

14:39.335 --> 14:41.086
or scaring them
this past week?

14:41.137 --> 14:43.788
Well, there was that one
weird guy up at the <i>heiau.</i>

14:43.839 --> 14:45.140
What weird guy?

14:45.224 --> 14:47.475
Somebody was bothering them
a few nights ago.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.060
Christian tried to
make him go away,

14:49.128 --> 14:51.146
and I guess he fell and
hit his head on a rock.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.932
Kat said he was
bleeding really bad.

15:03.692 --> 15:05.410
(birds singing)

15:05.477 --> 15:07.112
Hey.

15:07.163 --> 15:08.329
Hey.

15:08.414 --> 15:09.514
- Anything?
- Not yet.

15:09.582 --> 15:11.166
I was hoping since
it hadn't rained

15:11.250 --> 15:12.751
the past few days,
we'd get lucky.

15:12.818 --> 15:14.836
Did you get the warrant yet
to exhume Straithan's grave?

15:14.920 --> 15:16.671
No, I'm still working on it.

15:16.756 --> 15:19.874
If you find his blood up here,
it'll help convince the judge

15:19.959 --> 15:22.493
he's among the living.
Yeah.

15:22.545 --> 15:23.928
<i>Mahalo, Kahu.</i>

15:23.996 --> 15:25.180
No problem, sistah.

15:25.264 --> 15:27.265
The <i>kupuna</i> like you.

15:32.555 --> 15:33.555
You hitting
Pops later?

15:33.639 --> 15:35.607
- Yeah.
- Waves should be firing.

15:35.674 --> 15:37.142
See you there.
All right.

15:37.209 --> 15:39.561
Kono, check this out.

15:39.645 --> 15:40.779
That's blood.

15:40.846 --> 15:42.230
Roommate was right.

15:42.314 --> 15:44.783
Looks like someone
took a nasty fall.

15:57.746 --> 16:00.165
LORI:
<i>This isn't the first time</i>

16:00.216 --> 16:02.383
Nikki Royce has been
committed for mental issues.

16:02.468 --> 16:03.968
As a teenager, she
was hospitalized

16:04.036 --> 16:05.220
with an eating
disorder.

16:05.287 --> 16:06.471
All right.

16:06.538 --> 16:07.722
(woman laughing)

16:07.807 --> 16:09.257
So, the, uh...
the Halloween party

16:09.341 --> 16:11.309
you went to--
who threw it?

16:11.376 --> 16:12.660
Oh, just a friend.

16:12.728 --> 16:14.095
Ah.

16:14.163 --> 16:15.897
Go by yourself?

16:15.981 --> 16:17.649
This is it.
(woman laughing)

16:17.716 --> 16:19.550
Don't let her get
too close to you.

16:19.602 --> 16:21.436
She is a scratcher.

16:21.504 --> 16:23.822
(door squeaks open,
whispering)

16:23.889 --> 16:28.126
Listen, I said I am not going
back into the chicken anymore.

16:28.194 --> 16:29.277
You can't make me.

16:29.361 --> 16:30.411
The chicken?

16:30.496 --> 16:32.163
Kitchen. Kitchen!

16:32.231 --> 16:33.248
There are...
There are bugs.

16:33.332 --> 16:34.398
There are bugs.

16:34.450 --> 16:36.501
(groans)

16:36.568 --> 16:38.586
(whispering): Listen, I told them...
I told them, and...

16:38.671 --> 16:41.239
So, Nikki, we need to
talk to you about Greg.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.590
Okay?

16:42.675 --> 16:44.676
Look. The lights.

16:44.743 --> 16:46.511
There's something
in the lights.

16:46.578 --> 16:49.247
It stabs you.

16:49.298 --> 16:51.015
- Nikki, talk to us about Greg.
- No.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.634
No, I can't. No, no.

16:52.718 --> 16:54.302
No, I can't.

16:54.386 --> 16:56.521
- I can't.
- We know he's alive.

16:56.588 --> 16:57.922
(gasps)

16:57.973 --> 17:00.141
You guys

17:00.226 --> 17:01.309
faked his death.

17:01.393 --> 17:03.361
You pretend to be crazy.

17:03.428 --> 17:05.429
And take the chance the hospital
will discharge you

17:05.481 --> 17:07.115
in a couple of years, right?

17:12.121 --> 17:13.655
Oh, thank God.

17:13.739 --> 17:15.540
Thank you.

17:15.607 --> 17:17.541
Thank you
so much.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.944
Okay, no one will believe me.

17:19.994 --> 17:22.079
All right, well,
where is he?

17:23.781 --> 17:27.167
He comes at night
and talks to me.

17:28.220 --> 17:30.054
Ah.

17:30.122 --> 17:32.390
You've got
to tell them.

17:32.457 --> 17:33.558
They won't believe me.

17:33.625 --> 17:35.793
Hmm.

17:35.844 --> 17:37.845
- I shot him!
- Who did you shoot,

17:37.930 --> 17:38.963
Nikki? Who'd you kill?

17:39.014 --> 17:41.516
Greg.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.601
Then he came back.

17:44.653 --> 17:47.021
(whispering):
He's haunting me.

17:47.106 --> 17:49.807
Can you help
me, please?

17:49.858 --> 17:53.077
I just want him to go away
so I can get some sleep.

17:53.145 --> 17:55.330
Please?
Yeah.

17:55.414 --> 17:57.315
STEVE:
<i>Okay, so,</i>

17:57.366 --> 17:59.483
your professional assessment--
is she just a great liar?

17:59.535 --> 18:02.153
In the course of five minutes,
we witnessed aphasia,

18:02.204 --> 18:05.089
dermatillomania, paranoia,
vivid hallucinations.

18:05.157 --> 18:07.325
My professional assessment--
that girl's off her rocker.

18:07.376 --> 18:09.510
Yeah, a little bit,
but is she telling the truth?

18:09.595 --> 18:10.929
Did she shoot Straithan?

18:10.996 --> 18:12.830
Well, she thinks she did,
but there's no way to tell

18:12.881 --> 18:14.465
if she shot him
or somebody else.

18:14.516 --> 18:16.050
All right, listen,
get Danny on the phone,

18:16.135 --> 18:17.468
have him meet you
at Straithan's apartment.

18:17.519 --> 18:18.886
And maybe forensics
can tell us who

18:18.971 --> 18:20.271
she actually
killed.

18:21.890 --> 18:23.841
DANNY:
<i>The apartment was available</i>

18:23.892 --> 18:25.476
15 minutes ago,
and now it's rented?

18:25.527 --> 18:26.644
Doesn't make any sense.

18:26.712 --> 18:28.112
What, you trying
to shake me down?

18:28.180 --> 18:29.864
Well, I'm a cop.
How about that?

18:29.949 --> 18:31.532
Hello?

18:31.617 --> 18:32.951
Hello?!

18:33.018 --> 18:34.402
If you're looking
for an apartment,

18:34.486 --> 18:36.955
I think there's one available
in this building.

18:37.022 --> 18:39.907
Oh, uh, yeah,
that's-that's nice, but I think

18:39.992 --> 18:41.409
it's a little rich
for my blood. Thank you.

18:41.493 --> 18:43.594
You'll have to
take the stairs.

18:43.662 --> 18:46.080
Something is wrong
with the elevator.

18:46.165 --> 18:48.049
Of course something's wrong
wi the elevator.

18:48.133 --> 18:49.217
I'm cursed.

18:49.285 --> 18:50.668
- Oh.
DANNY: Hey.

18:50.719 --> 18:53.137
So, what do we got?

18:53.205 --> 18:55.423
Well, plenty of blood
to test, as you can see.

18:55.507 --> 18:56.591
Luckily,
the crime scene cleaners

18:56.659 --> 18:58.393
are backed up.
We'll compare

18:58.477 --> 19:00.595
the DNA from the blood splatter
to the DNA from his hair.

19:00.679 --> 19:02.563
If they match each other,
Greg Straithan's dead.

19:02.648 --> 19:04.232
If not, he's most likely
our killer.

19:04.316 --> 19:06.100
His landlord was just telling me
about Straithan's habits.

19:06.185 --> 19:07.718
- How are you?
- Good.

19:07.770 --> 19:08.886
This a two-bedroom?

19:08.937 --> 19:10.905
Yeah.

19:10.973 --> 19:13.741
Uh, Straithan-- did he, uh...
he seem like the kind of guy

19:13.826 --> 19:15.159
that would fake his own death?

19:15.227 --> 19:16.277
Well, he certainly
was secretive.

19:16.362 --> 19:18.246
I was never sure what
he did for a living.

19:18.330 --> 19:19.914
Always paid for
everything with cash.

19:19.999 --> 19:22.050
Huh. This is nice, this carpet.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.584
This rug here--
what is this?

19:23.669 --> 19:26.120
- This Berber?
- Yeah.

19:26.205 --> 19:29.090
Huh. Thought so.
(phone ringing)

19:29.174 --> 19:31.459
Um, did he ever seem
like he was afraid?

19:31.527 --> 19:32.994
Maybe he was hiding
from somebody?

19:33.062 --> 19:35.713
Oh, I don't think so. He was
a pretty intimidating person.

19:35.764 --> 19:38.099
This is very nice.
Italian marble.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.269
You know, uh, by law,
you know, you're gonna have

19:41.337 --> 19:43.638
to disclose that there
was a murder here.

19:43.722 --> 19:45.589
You'll probably have
to cut the rent in half.

19:45.641 --> 19:46.808
You think?

19:46.892 --> 19:48.860
Yeah, at least.
I mean, most people-- they won't

19:48.927 --> 19:51.245
even rent a place where
there's been a violent crime.

19:51.313 --> 19:52.947
Bad mojo, stuff like that.

19:53.015 --> 19:56.367
Me, personally-- I don't mind
a little bit of blood.

19:56.435 --> 19:59.537
Okay, Chin just got the warrant
to dig up Straithan's grave.

20:01.407 --> 20:02.940
All I can tell you is,

20:02.991 --> 20:05.910
the last time I saw that casket,
he was in there.

20:05.978 --> 20:07.128
All right,

20:07.212 --> 20:09.664
but are you certain
it was Greg Straithan's body?

20:09.748 --> 20:11.299
I only know
what I was told.

20:11.383 --> 20:14.502
I'm not gonna get in trouble
for this, am I?

20:14.586 --> 20:16.204
You're manipulating
a landlord into renting you

20:16.271 --> 20:18.139
a dead guy's
apartment at a cut rate.

20:18.207 --> 20:19.607
- Is that right?
- Absolutely.

20:19.675 --> 20:20.975
That's interesting.

20:21.043 --> 20:22.410
It's the move, babe.

20:22.478 --> 20:23.845
I mean, all the
homicide detectives

20:23.912 --> 20:25.229
back home have
the nicest pads.

20:25.297 --> 20:27.014
- I'm telling you.
- Huh.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.354
Let me just go on record
by saying

20:33.439 --> 20:36.157
I think it's wrong to disturb
someone's final resting place.

20:36.241 --> 20:37.942
Okay. Noted on record.

20:37.993 --> 20:39.360
Now crack it open.

20:49.621 --> 20:51.005
Okay. Wait a minute.

20:51.090 --> 20:52.540
This gravesite
was undisturbed?

20:54.493 --> 20:57.095
Is there any sign anybody
could have messed with this?

20:57.162 --> 20:59.046
No, not a thing.

21:01.433 --> 21:04.018
Then I am completely at a loss
as to how to explain this.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.708
MAX:
<i>Well, I have</i>

21:12.709 --> 21:14.126
either good news
or bad news,

21:14.194 --> 21:15.695
depending on where
you stand.

21:15.762 --> 21:17.863
Your dead suspect
is, in fact, dead.

21:17.931 --> 21:19.165
Well, what'd you find?

21:19.232 --> 21:20.332
Well, the two
DNA samples

21:20.400 --> 21:21.600
from Greg Straithan's
apartment--

21:21.668 --> 21:23.202
the blood from
the murder scene

21:23.270 --> 21:25.104
and his hair from
his brush-- they matched.

21:25.172 --> 21:27.740
Okay, so unless Straithan
reanimated as a zombie,

21:27.808 --> 21:29.508
he is definitely
and simply dead.

21:29.576 --> 21:32.995
Well, considering
his head wasn't intact,

21:33.062 --> 21:36.415
reanimating as a zombie
would be completely impossible.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.583
Right.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.251
Now, for the curveball.

21:39.336 --> 21:41.370
The blood that Kono found
at the <i>heiau--</i>

21:41.421 --> 21:43.789
well, it belonged
to an unknown subject.

21:43.874 --> 21:45.124
Didn't match Straithan,

21:45.208 --> 21:47.126
the victims
or anybody in the system.

21:47.210 --> 21:49.261
Okay, well, chances are that
blood belongs to our killer.

21:49.346 --> 21:51.514
Hey. It's Kono.

21:51.581 --> 21:53.682
Fong found something
on the camcorder.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.351
She's on her way
to see him now.

21:55.418 --> 21:56.752
I started by isolating
the footage

21:56.803 --> 21:58.521
from the point
the camera goes airborne.

21:58.588 --> 22:00.973
Took some doing, but
after demultiplexing

22:01.057 --> 22:02.358
and deinterfacing
the segment,

22:02.425 --> 22:03.692
I was able to enhance

22:03.760 --> 22:04.860
and highlight the
individual frames.

22:04.928 --> 22:06.312
That's the duffel bag.

22:06.396 --> 22:08.197
Camera went
right over it.

22:08.264 --> 22:10.149
Good news is...

22:10.233 --> 22:12.651
the bag was open.

22:13.887 --> 22:15.821
That look like a hand to you?

22:15.906 --> 22:18.273
Yeah, and I bet it belongs
to Greg Straithan.

22:18.325 --> 22:19.875
That would explain

22:19.943 --> 22:22.294
how his fingerprint
showed up on the victim.

22:22.379 --> 22:24.547
He wasn't at the <i>heiau,</i>
but his fingers were.

22:24.614 --> 22:26.215
So Kat gets knocked over,

22:26.282 --> 22:28.384
she falls face-first
into the bag,

22:28.451 --> 22:30.803
fingerprint transfers
onto her glasses.

22:30.887 --> 22:32.955
What I can't explain
is how his hand ended up

22:33.006 --> 22:35.057
five miles from where he
was supposed to be buried.

22:36.626 --> 22:38.010
It's because the killer

22:38.094 --> 22:39.895
wasn't stealing anything
from the <i>heiau.</i>

22:39.963 --> 22:41.096
He was hiding something.

22:41.148 --> 22:43.149
I bet I know where the
rest of Straithan is.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.584
Thanks, Fong.

22:53.577 --> 22:55.578
(chanting in Hawaiian)

22:59.416 --> 23:01.367
DANNY: Oh, great.
There's Gabby.

23:01.451 --> 23:03.118
Did you know she was
going to be here?

23:03.170 --> 23:04.787
'Cause you should have
told me if you did.

23:04.855 --> 23:07.122
Did not, but, uh, that's not
going to help you, bud.

23:07.174 --> 23:09.258
You should just
be yourself. Be yourself.

23:09.325 --> 23:10.626
Hey, Gabby.

23:12.161 --> 23:13.262
What are you
doing here?

23:15.298 --> 23:19.051
Um, the Burial Council sent me
to ensure the <i>iwi</i> is protected.

23:19.135 --> 23:21.604
Right. Right. The <i>iwi.</i>

23:22.606 --> 23:23.772
That's the bones.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.391
- I know that.
- Protecting the cultural significance

23:25.475 --> 23:26.692
of this site is, uh...

23:26.776 --> 23:29.478
it's extremely important
to Daniel.

23:29.529 --> 23:31.447
DANNY:
Yeah.

23:31.514 --> 23:33.315
Don't you have someone
to, uh, go shoot?

23:33.366 --> 23:34.483
Nope. Nope.

23:34.534 --> 23:36.535
Hey, I heard you guys
had a lovely dinner.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.370
- Uh-huh.
- We did.

23:38.455 --> 23:40.623
- We... it was... it was lovely.
- It was good.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.458
I had a great time. Yeah.

23:42.525 --> 23:45.294
Hey, um, Grace really
wants to go to the museum,

23:45.361 --> 23:48.080
and, uh, I thought maybe I could
bug you for a private tour.

23:48.164 --> 23:49.882
I would love to meet Grace.

23:49.966 --> 23:52.084
Good. Good.

23:52.168 --> 23:53.252
Uh, Dr. Asano,
we're planning

23:53.336 --> 23:54.753
on using
ground-penetrating radar

23:54.838 --> 23:56.005
to locate
Straithan's remains.

23:56.056 --> 23:58.007
It utilizes
high-frequency EM waves

23:58.058 --> 23:59.425
to see beneath
the ground.

23:59.509 --> 24:01.143
That way, we won't have
to indiscriminately

24:01.210 --> 24:02.394
dig everything up.

24:02.479 --> 24:03.846
I'm sure the council
will be grateful

24:03.897 --> 24:05.180
for your efforts.
Good.

24:05.232 --> 24:07.099
CHIN:
Danny! Somebody threw

24:07.183 --> 24:08.484
a rock through your window.

24:08.551 --> 24:10.653
Yeah, I know. It happened
the night of the murders, Chin.

24:10.720 --> 24:12.187
Keep up, babe.
No, bruddah.

24:12.239 --> 24:13.606
The other one.

24:15.242 --> 24:16.558
How does this even happen?

24:16.610 --> 24:18.611
Well, maybe it's
the consequence of dismissing

24:18.695 --> 24:20.863
an entire culture's
spiritual beliefs.

24:20.914 --> 24:22.581
Oh, right, a ghost.

24:22.666 --> 24:24.566
A ghost busted my windows.
That really what you believe?

24:24.618 --> 24:25.834
Well, what
we believe,

24:25.902 --> 24:27.736
Danny, is that our ancestors
are here with us,

24:27.787 --> 24:29.872
just as much as they were
when they were alive.

24:31.007 --> 24:32.591
You... okay. Okay.

24:32.676 --> 24:34.076
Let me ask you a question.

24:34.127 --> 24:36.211
HPD, they secured this area,
correct?

24:36.263 --> 24:37.630
Correct. They closed
the access road down

24:37.714 --> 24:38.964
the night of the murder.

24:39.049 --> 24:41.350
Okay. So let's just imagine
for a moment

24:41.417 --> 24:43.619
that a living, breathing
human being did this to my car.

24:43.687 --> 24:44.887
I know it's crazy.

24:44.938 --> 24:46.221
Let's just imagine it.

24:46.273 --> 24:48.557
How is it that somebody
got here, came in,

24:48.608 --> 24:50.776
left, nobody said anything,
twice?

24:50.844 --> 24:52.361
Go ahead.
He never left.

24:53.396 --> 24:54.530
The homeless guy.

24:54.597 --> 24:56.282
That homeless guy told us
not to come in here

24:56.366 --> 24:57.616
the night of the murder.
It would explain

24:57.701 --> 24:59.234
the roommate's
story about the man

24:59.286 --> 25:01.036
who accosted the victims
a few nights prior.

25:01.104 --> 25:02.454
All right,
so what are we saying?

25:02.539 --> 25:03.539
Our killer lives here?

25:03.606 --> 25:05.157
I know where I would hide.

25:12.299 --> 25:14.516
You know, if I was homeless,

25:14.584 --> 25:16.752
living in Hawaii,
there's about 96,000 places

25:16.803 --> 25:18.887
I'd choose to live
before this one.

25:18.955 --> 25:20.806
STEVE (over radio):
It's private.

25:20.890 --> 25:23.175
Natural protection
from the elements.

25:23.259 --> 25:25.894
Access to the <i>heiau.</i>

25:30.433 --> 25:31.900
Okay.

25:31.968 --> 25:34.853
You know, it's really easy
to get lost in here.

25:34.938 --> 25:37.456
He probably knows
exactly where he's going.

25:40.476 --> 25:42.244
You just need to know
where to look.

25:43.279 --> 25:45.280
Well, that helps me.

25:57.644 --> 25:59.678
ASANO:
Ancient Hawaiian burials

25:59.763 --> 26:01.764
tend to be
no more than a meter deep.

26:01.831 --> 26:03.599
Okay. So anything above

26:03.666 --> 26:05.501
or below this marker
is most likely our guy.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.003
(beeping)

26:08.054 --> 26:10.222
Oh, got something here.

26:10.290 --> 26:12.107
What is that,
about two meters down?

26:12.175 --> 26:14.276
Looks like we found the rest
of Greg Straithan.

26:14.343 --> 26:15.427
(rapid beeping)

26:15.495 --> 26:16.862
Whoa. Hold on.
There's another one

26:16.946 --> 26:18.230
on the other side
of the field.

26:18.298 --> 26:19.431
Two and a half
meters down.

26:19.499 --> 26:21.617
I thought there
was only one body.

26:21.684 --> 26:23.002
LORI:
Supposed to be.

26:23.069 --> 26:25.120
Looks like multiple hits here.

26:25.188 --> 26:27.239
You have three or four
down there.

26:27.323 --> 26:28.991
MAN:
I got something!

26:29.042 --> 26:31.310
Okay, I'm going to need a radio.

26:33.797 --> 26:35.587
LORI (over radio): Steve, we've got more
than one body down here.

26:36.633 --> 26:37.883
Say again.

26:37.967 --> 26:39.534
It's looking like dozens
all over the <i>heiau.</i>

26:39.586 --> 26:41.003
I've seen something
like this before.

26:41.054 --> 26:43.138
It might be the dumping
ground of a serial killer.

26:56.770 --> 26:57.903
I got blood.

26:57.987 --> 26:59.238
Lot of it.

27:00.857 --> 27:02.508
I got the white bag
from the video.

27:03.893 --> 27:05.027
And it's empty, Danny.

27:06.212 --> 27:08.113
All right!
Hands up.

27:08.181 --> 27:09.231
Put your hands
up right now.

27:09.282 --> 27:10.499
Drop the weapon.

27:10.566 --> 27:12.000
I warned you
not to come here.

27:12.068 --> 27:13.736
Drop the weapon right now.

27:13.803 --> 27:14.920
Get on your knees.

27:18.842 --> 27:20.242
STEVE:
On your knees.

27:20.293 --> 27:21.510
On your knees.

27:24.297 --> 27:25.964
Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

27:32.922 --> 27:35.090
You angered the spirits.

27:35.141 --> 27:37.526
I know.
That's what I keep hearing.

27:40.013 --> 27:41.447
Let's go.

27:53.999 --> 27:56.634
Your name is Samuel Lee.

27:56.701 --> 27:58.419
You're a combat veteran.

27:58.503 --> 28:00.137
Vietnam.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.811
How long you been homeless,
Samuel?

28:12.984 --> 28:14.551
All right.

28:16.554 --> 28:17.938
We're testing this bag
right now.

28:18.023 --> 28:19.890
It had a severed
hand in it.

28:19.941 --> 28:21.725
You want to tell us

28:21.776 --> 28:24.061
how it got in there,
help yourself out?

28:24.112 --> 28:26.280
No. It was empty
when I found it.

28:26.364 --> 28:28.565
It was contaminating

28:28.616 --> 28:29.667
the <i>heiau.</i>

28:29.734 --> 28:30.901
DANNY:
Quite a nasty gash

28:30.952 --> 28:32.286
you got on your forehead.

28:32.370 --> 28:33.754
Want to tell me
how it happened?

28:33.838 --> 28:34.922
Keep in mind...

28:35.006 --> 28:37.124
I already know the answer.

28:41.963 --> 28:45.849
They were trespassers.

28:47.352 --> 28:49.269
Too many people.

28:49.354 --> 28:53.256
Too many people treading
on the <i>iwi</i> of the <i>tupuna.</i>

28:53.308 --> 28:55.059
DANNY: You attacked
these two kids.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.259
And they fought back,

28:56.311 --> 28:58.228
and you fell down,
hit your head on a rock.

28:58.279 --> 28:59.947
Is that what you mean?

29:00.031 --> 29:02.199
They were desecrating the <i>aina.</i>

29:02.266 --> 29:03.484
So you beat them to death
with a shovel?

29:03.568 --> 29:04.601
No!

29:04.652 --> 29:06.320
I warned them to stay away.

29:06.404 --> 29:08.205
Like I warned you.

29:09.824 --> 29:13.127
But they...
they wouldn't listen.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.612
Do you always protect the <i>heiau?</i>

29:15.663 --> 29:17.280
It wants me to protect it.

29:17.332 --> 29:19.416
It needs me to keep its secrets.

29:21.086 --> 29:23.637
Just like it keeps your
secrets, right, Samuel?

29:23.722 --> 29:26.140
I mean, it's the perfect place
to dump a body.

29:26.224 --> 29:28.792
No one would ever
dare look there.

29:28.843 --> 29:32.229
No. No, the land is sacred.

29:32.296 --> 29:33.564
Kapu.

29:33.631 --> 29:36.299
They're...
they're being punished.

29:36.351 --> 29:37.684
By the evil spirits

29:37.769 --> 29:39.219
and blah, blah, blah.

29:39.287 --> 29:40.821
Uh... (chuckles)

29:40.905 --> 29:42.773
What about the rock
that hit my window?

29:42.824 --> 29:45.325
Was that an evil spirit, too?
No, I think that was you.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.662
You needed to learn respect!

29:50.448 --> 29:53.117
What happens to people
that don't respect the <i>heiau?</i>

29:54.819 --> 29:57.871
They open the door.

30:01.209 --> 30:04.595
The dead will be looking
for you now.

30:07.465 --> 30:08.766
LORI:
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:08.833 --> 30:10.684
He's clearly disturbed,
but I don't like him for this.

30:10.769 --> 30:12.002
What's not to like?

30:12.053 --> 30:14.254
I mean, he, uh, had the bag
from the crime scene,

30:14.322 --> 30:16.339
he admits to jumping those kids,
and he is obsessed

30:16.391 --> 30:17.775
with keeping people
out of the <i>heiau.</i>

30:17.842 --> 30:19.026
All right, which
begs the question--

30:19.094 --> 30:20.861
would he ever dig it
up to bury bodies?

30:20.945 --> 30:22.512
I don't think so.
Plus, if we're looking

30:22.564 --> 30:23.730
for a serial killer,
we're looking

30:23.815 --> 30:24.898
for someone organized,
meticulous.

30:24.983 --> 30:26.533
Samuel does not fit
the profile at all.

30:26.618 --> 30:28.185
I'm not convinced it
is a serial killer.

30:28.236 --> 30:29.820
I mean, where does
Greg Straithan fit in?

30:29.871 --> 30:31.438
We know who killed him,
right? Nikki Royce.

30:31.506 --> 30:33.624
Why would a
serial killer bury

30:33.691 --> 30:35.709
an already dead body
in his dumping ground?

30:35.794 --> 30:37.077
MAX:
<i>I think we can explain.</i>

30:37.162 --> 30:40.164
All told, there were 32
different victims

30:40.215 --> 30:41.915
dismembered and buried
at the <i>heiau.</i>

30:42.000 --> 30:43.517
They all died within
the past two years.

30:43.585 --> 30:45.502
We've already identified
three of them

30:45.553 --> 30:47.871
through the DNA database--
James Yamamoto,

30:47.922 --> 30:49.706
Chuck Anderson
and Emma Kirkland.

30:49.757 --> 30:51.008
But here's the interesting part.

30:51.059 --> 30:52.509
Emma died in a
car accident,

30:52.560 --> 30:53.927
Chuck had a
brain aneurysm,

30:54.012 --> 30:56.063
and James died
of a heart attack.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.380
Anyone care to venture a guess

30:57.432 --> 30:59.049
as to what they all
have in common?

30:59.100 --> 31:00.317
Well, none of them
were murdered.

31:00.384 --> 31:01.702
FONG:
Exactly.

31:01.769 --> 31:03.553
Meaning we don't have
a serial killer on the Island.

31:03.605 --> 31:06.607
Now, every single body
had a specific part missing.

31:06.691 --> 31:08.742
Very precise surgical work.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.894
Whoever did this definitely
had medical experience.

31:10.945 --> 31:12.162
Okay, well, that...

31:12.230 --> 31:13.831
I mean, that rules out
Samuel Lee completely.

31:13.898 --> 31:14.832
FONG:
Plus,

31:14.899 --> 31:16.216
the blood you guys found
on his machete

31:16.284 --> 31:18.085
and at his campsite--
wild boar.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.286
He'd just
killed dinner.

31:19.370 --> 31:21.672
Okay, so what parts
were missing exactly?

31:21.739 --> 31:24.007
The ligaments and tendons
from major joints--

31:24.075 --> 31:28.095
the elbows, knees, wrists--
were all removed postmortem.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.246
On a hunch,

31:29.297 --> 31:31.398
I had Fong test
the duffel bag

31:31.466 --> 31:33.567
for evidence of
liquid nitrogen.

31:33.635 --> 31:34.968
All over the inside
of the bag.

31:35.053 --> 31:36.303
I don't know
what that means.

31:36.387 --> 31:38.622
MAX: Well, liquid nitrogen
is utilized by biotech firms

31:38.690 --> 31:40.240
to freeze donor tissues.

31:40.308 --> 31:42.192
Most of the organs have
to be harvested

31:42.260 --> 31:43.477
from living bodies.

31:43.561 --> 31:46.196
However, there are some tissues
that can be harvested

31:46.264 --> 31:48.532
from cadavers
up to 48 hours after death.

31:48.599 --> 31:51.201
Okay, so our guy
steals dead bodies,

31:51.269 --> 31:52.536
cuts off the parts
that he needs,

31:52.603 --> 31:54.121
and then dumps the bodies
back in the <i>heiau</i>

31:54.205 --> 31:55.122
where no one will look.

31:55.190 --> 31:56.290
Exactly.

31:56.374 --> 31:57.624
We're not looking
for a serial killer.

31:57.709 --> 31:58.992
We're looking for a businessman

31:59.077 --> 32:00.994
who's selling cadaver parts
on the black market.

32:04.499 --> 32:06.967
HPD has no active investigation
into the body parts trade.

32:07.051 --> 32:09.086
However, nationwide
it's a booming business.

32:09.137 --> 32:10.337
Cadaver tissue can be used

32:10.421 --> 32:13.056
in anything from ACL surgery
to filling in wrinkles.

32:13.124 --> 32:15.842
They make a profit
by giving the tissue away

32:15.927 --> 32:17.594
but charging
huge shipping fees.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.730
I mean, an ACL alone
can cost five grand.

32:19.797 --> 32:21.348
We also found
another commonality

32:21.432 --> 32:23.350
between the three
identified bodies.

32:23.434 --> 32:24.568
They all had their funerals

32:24.635 --> 32:25.852
and burials at the same place:

32:25.937 --> 32:28.822
Makaha Memorial Park
and Mortuary.

32:28.907 --> 32:30.157
Might sound familiar to you--

32:30.241 --> 32:31.325
that's where we dug up
Straithan's casket.

32:31.409 --> 32:32.326
Okay, well, that's
how he's getting

32:32.410 --> 32:33.694
his hands on the bodies.

32:33.778 --> 32:34.912
He intercepts them
before they go

32:34.979 --> 32:35.979
in the ground.
And according

32:36.030 --> 32:37.864
to the families, our friendly

32:37.949 --> 32:39.366
neighborhood mortuary attendant
is the one

32:39.434 --> 32:41.151
who helped them

32:47.175 --> 32:48.125
He's got
a record--

32:48.176 --> 32:49.376
extortion and fraud.

32:49.460 --> 32:50.627
If he killed Kat

40:11.497 --> 40:13.048
It just costs an extra 50 bucks.

40:13.115 --> 40:15.016
You only cost me a beer.

40:15.101 --> 40:16.051
- Hey.
- Welcome.

40:16.135 --> 40:18.470
Just the last
of the paperwork to sign.

40:18.521 --> 40:20.722
All right, um, everything
looks great, by the way.

40:20.806 --> 40:22.190
Oh, good.
Yeah.

40:22.275 --> 40:24.459
Um, I was going to ask
you about a pet deposit,

40:24.527 --> 40:26.278
if, uh, I need to put that
because my daughter--

40:26.345 --> 40:27.445
she wants a dog.

40:27.513 --> 40:29.781
Oh, I'm sorry, we have
a strict no pet policy.

40:29.848 --> 40:31.199
What are you
talking about?

40:31.284 --> 40:32.484
What about
the old lady?

40:32.535 --> 40:34.352
- What old lady?
- The old lady

40:34.403 --> 40:36.788
with the big dopey hat and the
little dog, and she was gardening.

40:36.855 --> 40:39.574
She's the one who told me the
elevator was busted, which,

40:39.659 --> 40:41.126
by the way, you're
gonna fix, right?

40:41.193 --> 40:43.128
It sounds like
you're describing Mrs. Kekoa.

40:43.195 --> 40:45.246
Okay, Mrs. Kekoa.

40:45.331 --> 40:47.549
Well, Mrs. Kekoa died
five years ago.

40:47.633 --> 40:50.585
She fell down
the elevator shaft.

40:52.638 --> 40:54.556
STEVE:
Okay.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.541
Hey.

40:56.592 --> 40:58.510
Bed's all,
uh, set up.

40:58.561 --> 41:00.261
What else?

41:00.346 --> 41:02.397
Uh...

41:02.465 --> 41:04.933
yeah, we're, we're gonna,
we're gonna leave.

41:05.017 --> 41:06.418
ALL: What?

41:06.485 --> 41:08.086
Pack it up,
pack it up.

41:08.154 --> 41:09.070
- You mean "pack it up"?
- Hey.

41:09.155 --> 41:11.940
Pack it up, pack it up.

41:12.024 --> 41:13.058
Hey, hey.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.043
Danny, wait a minute,
where are you going?

41:15.111 --> 41:16.244
Danny, wait.
