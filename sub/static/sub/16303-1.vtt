- [thumping noise]

01:28.522 --> 01:30.358
- Look at him, Mullins.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.725
He's crying.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.726
- Good.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.563
Because I'm tired
of playing games.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.732
Tell us what we want to know.

01:39.900 --> 01:40.901
- I don't know.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.403
- You heard her!

01:42.403 --> 01:43.637
How'd you do it, shithead?

01:43.637 --> 01:44.538
- I told you.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.606
Okay?

01:45.606 --> 01:46.240
I don't, I'm not the
science guy.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.775
That's Connor.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.878
- Sounds like crybaby wants to
go back in the isolation cube.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.612
- No, no, no.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.313
Please, please. No.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.148
I'll talk. I will.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.518
- Start from the beginning.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.724
- I guess if I had to
start at the beginning...

02:03.724 --> 02:07.127
the very beginning,
the very start...

02:09.397 --> 02:12.132
It was the night Hannah
tried to break up with me.

02:13.467 --> 02:17.605
- [romantic music,
champagne pouring]

02:19.840 --> 02:21.275
- Mmm.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.243
Cristal.

02:22.243 --> 02:22.910
Very bubbly.

02:22.910 --> 02:23.777
Very bubbly.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.645
- WAITER: Merci.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.447
- De nada.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.417
- Sam, that's way too expensive.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.684
- I disagree.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.753
Hannah, nothing is too
expensive when you're

02:32.753 --> 02:35.656
on a date with the most
beautiful woman alive.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.890
- We have to break up.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.627
- What?

02:39.627 --> 02:41.929
- [dishes crash]

02:42.796 --> 02:43.631
- Hannah?

02:43.631 --> 02:44.665
Hannah?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.635
- Sor- geez- Sorry.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.702
I'm sorry.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.605
Hannah, Hannah, wait!

02:51.605 --> 02:52.573
What are you doing?

02:52.573 --> 02:53.541
- I'm leaving!

02:53.541 --> 02:54.542
It's over, Sam!

02:54.542 --> 02:56.009
- No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.510
I think you're just stressed
out about your dissertation.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.611
- No.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.680
Actually, I'm quitting
my dissertation.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.281
- You're quitting
your dissertation?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.515
- Mhm. Yeah.

03:01.515 --> 03:01.982
A Masters degree isn't
worth shit anymore.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.518
- How...

03:04.518 --> 03:05.253
What about all the work
you've done in micro...

03:05.253 --> 03:06.254
or, uh...

03:06.254 --> 03:07.455
macro...

03:07.455 --> 03:08.789
bio...

03:08.789 --> 03:10.391
- You don't even know what
I'm studying, do you?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.692
- I do know what
you're studying.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.893
I know that it's important.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.295
And that it's worth finishing.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.497
Why don't we just go back
inside, because I just ordered

03:16.497 --> 03:18.766
some tiny toasts that I think
you're gonna-

03:18.766 --> 03:20.668
there's five different
types of hummus.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.769
- Okay, you're not hearing me.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.170
- I... I am hearing you.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.439
Okay, I'm hearing that you're
upset about your research

03:25.439 --> 03:27.308
and you're kinda taking it
out on me, but that's okay.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.175
- Sam...

03:28.175 --> 03:29.343
- No, no! Wait, what about this?

03:29.343 --> 03:30.210
Here's an idea.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.512
Join my research team, okay?

03:31.512 --> 03:32.780
- Dog dreams?
- Yeah!

03:32.780 --> 03:33.681
- No thank you.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.415
- We're making great strides.

03:34.415 --> 03:34.915
Hannah, I think you-

03:34.915 --> 03:36.884
Stop.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.954
I didn't want to say the cliched
"It's not you, it's me" thing.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.756
Because...

03:44.592 --> 03:46.260
It is you.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.862
But it's also me.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.766
I gotta find my own thing.

03:52.766 --> 03:53.867
- What about our thing?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.369
You know?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.837
I thought we had
something good.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.572
- Yeah.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.973
We had good times
in the beginning.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.041
- So let's get back to that!

04:01.041 --> 04:02.009
You know, good times!

04:02.009 --> 04:02.610
Good times!

04:02.610 --> 04:03.577
Good times!

04:03.577 --> 04:05.012
- Sam.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.914
It's over.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.583
Goodbye.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.020
- Wait, Hannah.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.322
Um...

04:15.456 --> 04:17.024
Can I just have...

04:17.024 --> 04:18.992
a hug?

04:18.992 --> 04:21.028
Just, just for
old time's sake?

04:21.028 --> 04:29.570
- [music]

04:29.570 --> 04:30.904
- I'm sorry, Sam.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.274
- I'm sorry too.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.211
What is that?

04:38.211 --> 04:39.079
- Don't worry, just look
straight ahead.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.080
- What are
you doing?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.482
- Look straight...
- Wait, what?

04:48.922 --> 04:51.359
- MULLINS: Connor Harrison.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.794
Top of your class
at Regents Prep.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.597
Winner of the prestigious
Wittington scholarship.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.366
4.0 GPA.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.867
- That's an impressive
resume, kid.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.902
Some real Doogie Howser shit.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.971
I'm sure high school
was a ball.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.839
You know what, now we can add
kidnapping and using

05:05.839 --> 05:08.742
a university lab for illegal
purposes to the list.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.444
- Wow.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.745
That's quite an accusation.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.913
- Are you gonna dispute it?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.582
- No.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.083
But my lawyer will.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.885
- [laughing]

05:17.885 --> 05:19.553
You're not getting a lawyer,
dumbass.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.389
- Uh... news flash.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.790
This is America.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.425
- Is it?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.159
How can you be so sure?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.495
- You're a smart guy.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.730
Haven't you read about all
the secret black sites

05:29.730 --> 05:31.465
we've got all over the world?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.467
- Yeah, maybe we're
in one of those.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.469
- Maybe you're bluffing.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.571
- Do we look like people
who bluff?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.910
- Now... back to the story.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.414
You said you got
a call from Sam.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.849
- SAM: Oh shit, oh shit,
oh shit!

05:48.849 --> 05:50.751
I-I thought it was like one
of those amnesia devices

05:50.751 --> 05:52.453
from Men In Black !

05:52.453 --> 05:54.054
- It's not the brain neuralizer
from Men In Black ,

05:54.054 --> 05:55.055
you fucking idiot!

05:55.055 --> 05:56.356
- You should have
told me that!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.091
- Well, you shouldn't be
stealing shit from my lab!

05:58.091 --> 05:59.026
- Your lab?

05:59.026 --> 05:59.760
Your lab?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.961
It's our lab, okay?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.796
Don't forget that my money
funds this place.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.665
- Your father's money.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.934
- Did I kill her?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.603
Killer...

06:09.603 --> 06:11.905
killer party, dude...

06:11.905 --> 06:14.508
- [dog barking in distance]

06:14.508 --> 06:16.810
[car doors open]

06:17.945 --> 06:19.046
- SAM: Is she brain dead?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.047
Oh, God, Connor.

06:20.047 --> 06:20.881
What did I do?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.683
- No, you didn't hurt her.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.785
She's just in a temporary
hypnotic state.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.219
- Wait, how temporary?

06:26.219 --> 06:29.222
- With dogs it lasts four to
six hours, with a human...

06:29.222 --> 06:30.424
I don't know, maybe two?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.892
Jesus, what the hell
were you thinking?!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.160
- I don't know!

06:33.160 --> 06:34.562
I-I thought I could erase
all her bad memories.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.729
You know?

06:35.729 --> 06:36.830
Help Hannah get back
to the good times.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.931
- You only went out
for three months!

06:37.931 --> 06:40.133
- And that first month
was magical!

06:40.133 --> 06:40.768
- Sam.

06:40.768 --> 06:41.401
Listen to me.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.670
- No, you listen.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.704
She's...

06:43.704 --> 06:45.473
smart.

06:45.473 --> 06:48.976
And funny, and bold, and
complex like that

06:48.976 --> 06:52.480
$1,100 bottle of champagne that
I definitely forgot to pay for.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.213
- Buddy.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.715
I get it.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.584
She's your dream woman.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.720
But clearly you are
not her dream man.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.054
You need to figure out
a way to move on.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.923
- Dream man?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.125
Dream man.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.226
Connor.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.695
The Brain Frame.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.862
- The Brain Frame?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.531
- Yes, the Brain Frame.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.665
- What about it?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.033
- Don't you see?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.669
We hook Hannah up to the
Brain Frame and then I become

07:15.669 --> 07:16.837
her dream man.

07:16.837 --> 07:17.971
- No way!

07:17.971 --> 07:19.372
I've only tested that
thing on dogs!

07:19.372 --> 07:20.908
- This is how I can show her
what a terrible mistake

07:20.908 --> 07:21.542
she's made.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.275
- Absolutely not.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.010
Are you listening to me?

07:23.010 --> 07:23.644
It's way too risky.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.778
- Screw the risk!

07:24.778 --> 07:27.781
Connor, this is
trial by fire, baby!

07:27.781 --> 07:29.282
This is where
geniuses are forged!

07:29.282 --> 07:30.651
- You sound insane.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.685
- I sound insane?

07:31.685 --> 07:32.820
You know who else
sounded insane?

07:32.820 --> 07:33.721
Galileo.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.789
Uh, uh, uh, Benjamin Franklin.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.058
Wayne Szalinski.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.693
- From Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids ?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.094
Sam, he's fictional!

07:41.094 --> 07:42.496
What are you trying
to pitch me?

07:42.496 --> 07:46.634
- Do you want to be known as
a weird puppy scientist

07:46.634 --> 07:48.769
in a basement lab for the
rest of your life?

07:48.769 --> 07:52.105
Or do you want to fly a kite
in a god damn lightning storm

07:52.105 --> 07:53.907
and become a legend?

07:57.678 --> 08:00.981
- Appealing to my ego
is useless.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.817
- Fine.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.022
Then I'll take away your
funding and you'll go back

08:09.022 --> 08:11.792
to TA'ing Chemistry 101.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.497
- You're an asshole.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.068
Fine.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.903
- Yes!

08:23.704 --> 08:24.705
Yeah!

08:24.705 --> 08:33.647
- [suspense music]

08:33.647 --> 08:43.657
[upbeat tempo music, clicking
of typing on keyboard]

08:43.657 --> 08:54.201
[upbeat tempo music, clicking
of typing on keyboard]

08:54.201 --> 08:55.636
- Alright, how we looking?

08:55.636 --> 08:56.904
- Not good.

08:56.904 --> 08:57.905
The current simulations
I have are too unstable.

08:57.905 --> 08:58.806
- What?!

08:58.806 --> 08:59.607
Don't give me excuses, Connor.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.841
- These aren't excuses.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.876
If we're gonna do this,
we need an anchor.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.777
A wingman.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.045
- A wingman?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.179
- The human mind is incredibly
powerful, Sam.

09:06.179 --> 09:09.349
Ten times more powerful
than a canine's.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.118
We need a third wheel
to maintain stability.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.419
We don't want to
get lost in there.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.921
- Okay, what about your
creepy lab assistant?

09:13.921 --> 09:14.888
What's his name?

09:14.888 --> 09:15.789
- Larry.

09:15.789 --> 09:16.657
- Larry.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.025
- Larry!

09:18.025 --> 09:19.392
- Holy shit Larry, how long
have you been in here?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.694
- I can be your wingman.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.029
- No, you're the navigator.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.163
You're not mentally strong
enough to be the wingman.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.197
- Connor.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.498
- No, he's right.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.400
I have some pretty serious
self esteem issues,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.971
and her subconscious would
tear me to shreds.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.740
But, I'm good with the pups.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.141
Ain't I good with the pups?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.844
- Yes, you're great
with the puppies.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.111
- People call me the
Puppy Master.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.479
- Nobody calls you that.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.015
- Okay, so who are we gonna
get to be the wingman?

09:42.015 --> 09:46.854
- Well, we need somebody smart,
confident, borderline cocky.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.122
- No.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.057
No, no, no.

09:50.057 --> 09:50.924
Not him.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.392
Come on Connor, I hate that guy.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.127
- I hate him too.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.329
But he's the smartest,
cockiest...

09:56.329 --> 09:58.031
cock we know.

10:00.768 --> 10:01.501
- Slow it down, Berkman.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.569
- I can't slow down.

10:02.569 --> 10:05.138
And it's actually
sort of a problem.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.373
- You're funny.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.741
- And you blink too much.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.177
If you blink a little less,
I might take you home.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.311
- I've got a boyfriend.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.412
His name's Stackhouse.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.848
- Oh, he sounds very,
very smart.

10:14.848 --> 10:18.285
Is Stackhouse blind or does he
just like unattractive people?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.353
- He's a football player, and
when he gets back from the

10:20.353 --> 10:22.856
bathroom, he'll kick your ass.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.057
- I don't think so.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.859
You see, I know Krav Maga.

10:25.859 --> 10:26.760
- What?

10:26.760 --> 10:27.795
- Krav Maga?

10:27.795 --> 10:28.829
It's karate for Jews.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.130
- Berkman!

10:30.130 --> 10:32.099
- Well, well, well.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.134
Look who came crawling back.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.136
It's my old friends.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.773
Jude-asshole Iscariot and
Bene-dickhead Arnold.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.008
- Good one.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.309
- Come back to the king
to apologize, huh?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.310
- Apologize?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.544
For what?

10:44.544 --> 10:47.114
- Uh, for kicking me out
of our house senior year.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.316
- You burned down our house
with your secret meth lab.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.752
- Okay, first of all, it
wasn't meth, it was molly.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.054
And second of all, it wasn't
a secret, you guys knew

10:54.054 --> 10:55.222
I was a party boy.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.924
I even told you the
first time we met.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.191
I said, "I am a party boy.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.459
"I make my own molly.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.428
And I am on molly right now."

11:01.428 --> 11:03.163
- Yeah, that was a weird
thing to say in a

11:03.163 --> 11:04.197
Religious Studies class.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.065
- Berkman, we need
your help, okay?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.499
- I cannot help you tonight.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.202
I am sorry, but I am about
to reel in a super wet fish.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.172
'Cause I have been raining
down some negs on her hard.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.573
- What are negs?

11:13.573 --> 11:16.009
- Negs are when I say very,
very mean things to you

11:16.009 --> 11:17.911
and it confuses you, like
when you hold a magnet

11:17.911 --> 11:19.747
up to a bat's head.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.881
- [laughing]

11:20.881 --> 11:21.749
Oh my God!

11:21.749 --> 11:23.083
You are so funny!

11:23.083 --> 11:23.917
- I know.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.352
- Come on, anyone but him.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.054
- Seriously, stop blinking.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.223
It's freaking me out.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.691
Shots?

11:35.062 --> 11:36.163
We are gonna live forever.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.399
Mmm.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.201
Mmm.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.836
Mmm.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.273
[vomiting]

11:49.910 --> 11:51.812
I am so sorry.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.880
- Son of a b-

11:52.880 --> 11:53.981
- [smack]

11:53.981 --> 11:55.248
- [crowd gasps]

11:56.449 --> 11:59.352
- Yo, this guy just
knocked out Stackhouse!

11:59.352 --> 12:01.554
- Yeah, it's called a
preemptive strike.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.991
You've never heard
of the Six Day War?

12:05.458 --> 12:05.993
- [glass shatters]

12:05.993 --> 12:07.727
- Fire!

12:07.861 --> 12:08.728
- I hate that guy.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.562
- Everybody hates that guy.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.864
- Okay, who else is there?

12:10.864 --> 12:13.266
- I changed my mind,
I'd love to help you guys!

12:13.266 --> 12:14.367
- Oh, look who comes
crawling back.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.335
- [window breaking]

12:15.335 --> 12:16.236
- Oh shit!

12:16.236 --> 12:17.971
- Get out of the fucking car!

12:17.971 --> 12:19.339
- Drive!

12:21.008 --> 12:23.010
- Nobody pukes on Stackhouse!

12:23.010 --> 12:23.944
[bat slams on ground]

12:23.944 --> 12:24.878
Nobody!

12:26.179 --> 12:28.515
- So what do you tiny peens need
me to do for you, anyway?

12:28.515 --> 12:33.486
- [music "Creator"]

12:33.486 --> 12:44.064
* *

12:44.064 --> 12:47.000
* Got no need for
the fancy things *

12:47.000 --> 12:49.837
* All the attention
that it brings *

12:49.837 --> 12:52.940
* Tell me no, I say yes,
I was chosen *

12:52.940 --> 12:56.109
* And I will deliver
the explosion *

12:56.109 --> 13:01.581
* *

13:01.581 --> 13:02.582
- The fuck...

13:02.582 --> 13:04.417
Are you talking about?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.486
- I'm just telling you guys
all the weird shit

13:06.486 --> 13:08.221
that was going on in that lab.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.322
That's what you wanna hear,
right?

13:09.322 --> 13:10.490
- You're stalling.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.025
- What?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.226
- I.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.527
Am.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.329
Not.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.999
Stall... ing.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.300
- Levi Berkman.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.602
Roommate to Sam Wittington
and Connor Harrison.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.237
Met Freshman year undergrad.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.638
- Yeah, it was kind of a
housing lottery.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.207
They wouldn't have been my
first choice of roommates,

13:27.207 --> 13:28.075
to be honest.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.210
I mean, you've met the guys.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.512
- And you fell out Senior year
after you were caught

13:32.512 --> 13:35.315
manufacturing and distributing
illicit drugs.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.318
- Look, I didn't "fall out,"
I dropped out voluntarily.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.088
It was my choice because
college is a Ponzi scheme

13:41.088 --> 13:43.256
invented by Fannie Mae.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.092
And as for the charges?

13:45.092 --> 13:46.326
I was never convicted.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.460
- Right.
- Mhm.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.196
- You acted as your own
legal council on

13:49.196 --> 13:50.263
three separate arrests.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.464
- And I won, so...

13:51.464 --> 13:53.666
- Where did you get
your legal training?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.102
- I'm a huge fan
of Judging Amy.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.904
Never missed an episode.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.538
- This one's a comedian, Hobbs.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.474
- [scoffs] I've done a
few open mics.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.542
Crushed it every time.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.643
- Yeah, well...

14:03.643 --> 14:05.412
I'm not laughing, so...

14:05.412 --> 14:06.846
Tell us about Larry.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.950
- I tried to tell you about
Larry and all of his weird

14:09.950 --> 14:12.920
puppy dream shit, and you guys
cut me off like a bunch

14:12.920 --> 14:14.487
of grumpy Guses.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.089
- We know about the
beta testing on dogs.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.290
- Okay.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.625
So what else do you want
to know about Larry?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.592
- Where is he?!

14:19.592 --> 14:20.961
- So...

14:20.961 --> 14:22.129
uh...

14:22.129 --> 14:24.564
you guys don't actually
have him here.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.599
- He's one core member
we haven't located.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.001
- [scoffs]

14:28.001 --> 14:29.636
Well, I never would call him
a "core member," but...

14:29.636 --> 14:31.004
you know, whatever.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.606
I think what you guys really
want to know, is how this

14:33.606 --> 14:36.476
whole shit hurricane
got started.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.278
- Oh yeah.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.712
Little Sammy boy.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.615
And his pathetic
last shot at love.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.319
- [chalk scratches]

14:46.319 --> 14:48.288
[gas can rolling]

14:48.288 --> 14:49.389
- What a shit hurricane.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.790
- Okay.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.159
We didn't have time for a full
psych eval, and I have

14:52.159 --> 14:55.062
some key questions that need
to be answered before

14:55.062 --> 14:56.263
we enter Hannah's subconscious.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.564
- Okay.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.432
- It is essential that
you answer me honestly,

14:59.432 --> 15:01.001
thoroughly, and
without emotion.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.202
- I can do that.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.103
- Okay.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.138
One: what did Hannah do today?

15:05.138 --> 15:08.575
- Crush my soul and
my will to live.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.543
- Gonna go with "break up."

15:10.543 --> 15:12.745
- [chalk scratches]

15:12.745 --> 15:14.714
[typing]

15:14.714 --> 15:16.483
- Anything else?

15:16.483 --> 15:19.519
- Uh, she mentioned she watched
Starship Troopers on TBS.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.920
- Okay.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.589
- That's a good film.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.691
- Question two: what are
Hannah's biggest fears

15:24.691 --> 15:26.226
and stresses?

15:26.226 --> 15:29.529
- My unwillingness to grow up,
my constant need for approval,

15:29.529 --> 15:32.032
uh... being stuck in a
loveless relationship.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.100
With me.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.236
- Anything that isn't
centered around you?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.371
- Not really, no.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.240
Oh, I guess her aunt has cancer?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.474
That's probably stressful.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.675
Uh, she just finished chemo.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.477
Hannah's been in the
hospital a lot recently.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.445
- Oh yeah, hospital.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.579
That's really good.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.647
- Mhm.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.516
- We're definitely going
to use that.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.418
- Okay.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.686
Now this is the
really important one.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.355
Does Hannah have any
recurring nightmares?

15:55.355 --> 15:56.223
- Nope.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.290
- You're sure?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.125
- Connor.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.026
We're soul partners, okay?

15:59.026 --> 16:00.493
We tell each other everything.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.494
- Okay.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.063
No recurring-

16:03.063 --> 16:04.297
- Bullshit!

16:06.533 --> 16:08.401
You guys stole my idea.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.602
- I beg your pardon?

16:09.602 --> 16:11.304
- Remember?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.772
We were on shrooms and we were
watching Inception ,

16:12.772 --> 16:15.542
and I said, "Wouldn't it be rad
if we could hack into a

16:15.542 --> 16:17.244
"chick's brain and look at all
her naughty dreams and see what

16:17.244 --> 16:19.112
type of panties she likes?"

16:19.112 --> 16:20.047
- Vaguely?

16:20.047 --> 16:22.049
- Yeah!

16:22.049 --> 16:23.483
That's my idea.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.553
- Because you casually mentioned
something once while high?

16:26.553 --> 16:29.122
- Also, there was that time I
was on bath salts and we were

16:29.122 --> 16:31.191
watching Narnia , and I said,
"Wouldn't it be cool if

16:31.191 --> 16:33.726
beavers could actually talk
and build stuff for us?"

16:33.726 --> 16:36.096
And then you went and invented
a microchip that helped monkeys

16:36.096 --> 16:38.098
learn sign language.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.832
- And I suppose you'd
like credit for that too.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.734
- I think I deserve it.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.070
- Are we sure we need him?

16:43.070 --> 16:45.238
- Oh, just because he's an
awful and irredeemable

16:45.238 --> 16:47.374
human being doesn't mean his
cerebellum isn't ideally

16:47.374 --> 16:49.776
suited for this kind of
subconscious stimulation.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.510
- Thank you.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.280
That means an awful lot.

16:53.280 --> 16:53.880
- Oh!

16:53.880 --> 16:55.082
There it is!

16:55.082 --> 16:57.217
There's that shit-eating
grin I hate so much.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.718
- Look, Sam.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.687
If you wanna win Hannah back,
it takes three strong minds

17:00.687 --> 17:03.356
to keep her dream stable.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.326
- [sighs]

17:06.326 --> 17:07.660
Fine.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.829
Berkman, you are the real
genius behind all of this.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.730
- Great.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.465
Now, I just have one question.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.168
Who is the AMBER Alert
back there?

17:15.168 --> 17:16.636
- That would be
Larry T. Johnson.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.172
Navigator of this here
synaptic starship.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.373
- I don't like you.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.241
- Berkman.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.509
- Ah, don't worry about it.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.577
It's a common reaction
people have to my face

17:24.577 --> 17:26.179
and general presence.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.514
- Well, you better
get used to him.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.149
Because if it gets nasty in
there, he's the one

17:29.149 --> 17:30.217
who's gonna save us.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.318
- Uh... sorry, save us
from what?

17:31.318 --> 17:33.786
- Nightmares, seizures,
embolisms.

17:33.786 --> 17:34.554
- What?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.288
- Yeah.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.389
Just the usual suspects.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.624
- Relax.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.292
None of that is going to
happen as long as you

17:39.292 --> 17:40.360
follow the rules.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.194
- Oh, uh, Connor.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.562
B-T-W.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.730
I got that two-ply that you
asked for, for your uh...

17:43.730 --> 17:44.664
- Two-ply? What are you
talking about?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.766
- Yeah, remember, 'cause the...

17:46.766 --> 17:47.834
- Shhh, I don't have
time for this.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.636
Okay, guys, the very
important rules.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.737
- Okay, fuck the rules.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.704
This is science.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.206
Larry! Hit it!

17:53.206 --> 17:53.940
- You got it!

17:53.940 --> 17:54.574
- Wait, no, no, no!

17:54.574 --> 17:55.475
- No, no, no!

17:55.475 --> 17:59.612
- [electricity zapping, music]

17:59.612 --> 18:01.748
[music picks up]

18:01.748 --> 18:03.716
- Whoa, this is a trip.

18:03.716 --> 18:08.255
- [silence]

18:08.255 --> 18:13.426
[music starting back up]

18:13.426 --> 18:14.794

18:14.794 --> 18:16.629

18:16.629 --> 18:20.500
- [flare lights and burns]

18:20.500 --> 18:22.435
- Welcome to the Brain Frame.

18:22.435 --> 18:28.341
- [flare burns, music pulsing]

18:28.341 --> 18:30.710
- The Brain Frame?

18:30.710 --> 18:34.414
- So it's a machine that
allows you to place yourself

18:34.414 --> 18:36.249
inside another person's mind.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.421
- Sure, in layman's terms, I
guess you could put it that way.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.656
- So you go inside
Hannah's head?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.427
How does that even look?

18:47.427 --> 18:50.630
- [beeping, music]

18:50.630 --> 18:54.801
- It looks exactly the way
I designed it to look.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.838
- [fast paced music]

18:58.838 --> 19:02.509
