WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.263
Previously on The Good Wife:
Mr. Bishop?

00:02.300 --> 00:04.063
BISHOP: I don't want you
making the same mistake

00:04.100 --> 00:05.067
as the government,
thinking that,

00:05.100 --> 00:06.761
because of the color of my skin,
I sell drugs.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.461
Why shouldn't the courts
be kept honest

00:08.500 --> 00:11.060
about Bishop? Everybody deserves
representation.

00:11.110 --> 00:12.737
Does that stop suddenly
when it comes to...

00:12.780 --> 00:15.305
A criminal organization whose
sole purpose is to sell drugs?

00:15.340 --> 00:16.568
CARY:
Blake Calamar.

00:16.610 --> 00:18.646
In Baltimore,
he was working two jobs.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.079
When he wasn't protecting
Bond & Associates interest,

00:20.120 --> 00:21.417
he was out protecting

00:21.450 --> 00:24.681
MS—13, Baltimore's
biggest meth gang.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.517
WILL:
Bond played us
against each other.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.754
I don't like being played.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.623
So I suggest
we do the same to Bond.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.151
JUDGE:
Counselor?

00:38.570 --> 00:40.197
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.128
Mr. Rubio, what is your job?

00:42.170 --> 00:44.764
I'm a guard at the Northeast
Illinois Correctional Center.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.607
And what is this?

00:46.640 --> 00:49.768
An outdoor cell
on the yard.

00:49.810 --> 00:52.278
We use _it when an inmate
acts up In the prIson yard.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.447
And did anyone act up
on September 14th of last year?

00:54.480 --> 00:55.447
Yes, sir.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.084
Some inmates got in a fight,

00:57.120 --> 00:59.111
so I placed one
in the cage.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.354
And was it this inmate?

01:00.390 --> 01:02.187
Yes, sir.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.686
Jay Winston.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.186
Then I turned away
to handle the others,

01:05.230 --> 01:06.424
and when I came
back, he was...

01:06.460 --> 01:09.361
Winston was stabbed.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.129
And this is how you found him?

01:11.170 --> 01:13.764
Yes, sir. Dead.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.835
With this weapon?

01:14.870 --> 01:16.701
Yes, sir.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.537
A shiv found
inside the cage.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.606
And who did this shiv belong to?

01:20.640 --> 01:22.505
Him. _
You're referring

01:22.550 --> 01:25.144
to Joey Church,
inmate #321120?

01:25.180 --> 01:26.215
Yes, sir.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.241
Nothing further.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.282
Mr. Rubio,

01:36.330 --> 01:38.787
were you aware
of any previous conflicts

01:38.830 --> 01:40.229
between my client,
Joey, and the victim?

01:40.260 --> 01:41.625
No.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.867
Winston had just been
transferred in the week before.

01:43.900 --> 01:47.631
And how long did my client have
left on his 18 month sentence?

01:47.670 --> 01:48.898
Two weeks.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.135
Do you find many convicts
with two weeks left

01:51.170 --> 01:53.138
on their sentence
performing acts like this one?

01:53.180 --> 01:55.205
Objection.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.901
Sustained.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.919
To clarify, Mr. Rubio,

01:59.950 --> 02:03.181
you didn't see
the stabbing occur?

02:03.220 --> 02:04.881
No. Unfortunately,

02:04.920 --> 02:06.911
I did not.
And how did you
determine that this

02:06.960 --> 02:08.757
shiv was my client's?

02:08.790 --> 02:09.859
Well, they found
his DNA on it.

02:09.890 --> 02:11.653
But it was fashioned
from his toothbrush, correct?

02:11.690 --> 02:12.657
Yeah.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.656
So that would explain
the DNA.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.167
Objection.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.667
Outside
Mr. Rubio's expertise.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.930
I think it's just common sense,
don't you?

02:19.970 --> 02:23.406
The defendant's toothbrush
would have his DNA on it.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.260
Overruled.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.676
ALICIA:
Mr. Rubio, do inmates ever

02:27.710 --> 02:29.507
steal personal items
from one another?

02:29.550 --> 02:31.506
All the time.
So it's possible

02:31.550 --> 02:33.916
that another inmate stole
my client's toothbrush?

02:33.950 --> 02:34.939
Sure, possible.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.015
Nothing further.

02:36.050 --> 02:38.917
Your Honor, at this time,
we would like to be heard

02:38.950 --> 02:41.350
on precluding
the prosecution's next witness.

02:41.390 --> 02:42.926
Your Honor, the
defense had ample time

02:42.960 --> 02:43.984
to argue during pretrial.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.588
Yes, but new information
has come to our attention.

02:45.630 --> 02:46.790
Come on.
I'm always amazed

02:46.830 --> 02:48.957
_at how_convenient_
this new Information IS.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.024
Counselors.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.595
Shall we take this lovely
little debating society

02:52.640 --> 02:54.369
(bangs gavel)
into my chambers?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.301
GENEVA:
They're coming after
bought testimony.

02:57.340 --> 02:58.534
No. They'd play
that in court.

02:58.570 --> 02:59.605
It's the lie detector.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.971
They dinged us
on lack of motive.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.739
We need our eyewitness.
I know.

03:02.780 --> 03:04.407
Uh-oh.

03:06.350 --> 03:09.319
Whenever I see that bitch,
I know we're in trouble.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.457
ALICIA:
Their eyewitness denied
seeing anything, Your Honor.

03:13.490 --> 03:14.718
CARY:
Yes, initially,
because he didn't want

03:14.760 --> 03:15.954
to be seen
as a stool pIgeon.

03:15.990 --> 03:16.957
We offered no deal.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.628
Mr. Ellis changed his mind
of his own free will.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.753
After the police conducted
a lie detector test.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.791
A lie_ detector test
he Willingly agreed to.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.695
ALICIA:
Which caused him
to change his mind

03:24.730 --> 03:25.867
and claim he saw
this stabbing.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.789
Right. Because he was caught
lying by the lie detector.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.637
Carob chips, anyone?

03:32.380 --> 03:33.608
I'm good.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.972
Um... The bottom line,
Your Honor,

03:36.010 --> 03:39.343
is we don't intend to reference
the lie detector in court.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.369
We only intend to use

03:40.420 --> 03:41.717
Mr. Ellis' testimony.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.809
Your Honor, this is
a sworn affidavit from Iderdex.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.340
It's a manufacturer

03:45.390 --> 03:48.257
that services all
Cook County he detectors.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.326
They claim, during the week
in question,

03:50.360 --> 03:51.884
the lie detector
was out of serwce.

03:51.930 --> 03:54.455
Clearly, this was a case
of the police conducting

03:54.500 --> 03:55.649
an X detector.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.962
That is guesswork.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.833
An X detector?
Educate me.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.703
It's when the police
attach the suspect to
a fake lie detector,

04:02.740 --> 04:05.038
such as an Xbox
or a Xerox machine,

04:05.070 --> 04:07.300
making him think
that he's been caught lying.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.649
Your Honor, even if what
Mrs. Florrick alleges is true,

04:09.680 --> 04:11.272
I would cite People v. Lee.

04:11.310 --> 04:12.743
The police have leeway
to misrepresent

04:12.780 --> 04:13.940
during an interrogation.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.209
(sighs)

04:17.250 --> 04:19.889
I know your boss thinks
I'm pro-defense.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.478
Excuse me?

04:21.520 --> 04:23.420
Your boss--
Mr. Childs.

04:23.460 --> 04:26.429
I know he thinks
because I pal around

04:26.460 --> 04:28.894
with Bill Ayers and the like
that I'm pro-defense.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.364
Well, I don't believe that,
Your Honor.
The only problem is

04:31.400 --> 04:33.539
when I try to be
pro-prosecution,

04:33.570 --> 04:36.562
the police pull
a stunt like this.

04:38.410 --> 04:41.038
is not absolute,
Counselor.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.674
This was an extr_insic
misrepresentation

04:43.710 --> 04:47.544
and therefore your eyewitness
is excluded.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.582
Thank the police, not me.

04:54.620 --> 04:55.951
Good job.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.059
I didn't see
that one coming.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.785
Ah, I have to keep
you on your toes.

04:58.830 --> 05:01.048
So, anything
new on Blake?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.692
You just got my only
eyewitness kicked

05:02.730 --> 05:04.698
and you want my help?

05:04.730 --> 05:05.992
Yeah.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.498
(chuckles)

05:08.540 --> 05:10.337
We're talking a ten percent cut
across all departments.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.099
It's not our choice.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.007
If you haven't noticed,
Cook County is going
through a budget crisis.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.076
So, everybody keep
an eye on the OT.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.374
and unload any dead wood.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.513
We've got a dispo dump
at the end of the month.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.108
So separate the chaff.

05:23.150 --> 05:25.015
GENEVA:
What about investigator time?

05:25.050 --> 05:26.039
We just got beaten in court

05:26.090 --> 05:27.853
because the defense was
one step ahead of us.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.482
We're all doing more with less.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.827
Some of us aren't.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.419
If you're referring
to the Bishop investigation,

05:36.470 --> 05:38.859
drugs are drugs.
CARY:
So we just let a case

05:38.900 --> 05:40.538
from Lockhart/Gardner
slip through the cracks?

05:40.570 --> 05:42.060
If any case slips
through the cracks,

05:42.100 --> 05:44.830
the problem isn't the budget,
the problem is the ASA.

05:44.870 --> 05:46.064
Get creative.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.134
Use what you know.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.909
Okay, moving on.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.703
CARY:
Here's what I know.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.911
GENEVA:
No, we already questioned him.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.872
He had nothing to offer.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.988
He's got a parole hearing
in a week.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.420
Yep. He might be more open
to questioning.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.052
Getting creative.

06:04.090 --> 06:05.557
(knocking)
Hmm.

06:05.590 --> 06:06.955
Cary.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.527
(whispers):
Don't say anything
about the hair.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.700
What's going on?

06:20.180 --> 06:22.171
I hate to lose.

06:22.210 --> 06:26.613
And I hate to _lose to someone
who's outspendlng me two to one.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.517
You're on that prison knifing,
aren't you?

06:29.550 --> 06:31.017
That's just a pro bono
for them.

06:31.050 --> 06:32.142
They got Kalinda on it.

06:32.190 --> 06:34.010
Oh.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.880
Let me look into that.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.156
Diane Lockhart approached me.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.191
About?

06:44.230 --> 06:45.527
A job.

06:45.570 --> 06:46.992
And?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.860
I don't want to go.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.800
But you've got
student loans.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.829
Yes, I do.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.174
I put you on these
Lockhart/Gardner cases

07:00.220 --> 07:02.484
because you know them.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.614
So, show me you know them.

07:08.090 --> 07:10.479
WENDY:
Go ahead, read it.

07:10.530 --> 07:14.091
It says because I have a white
husband, I'm not really Black.

07:14.130 --> 07:16.564
It says my kids are half-breeds.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.865
It says they should be
embarrassed to go to school.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.538
Look at it.

07:21.570 --> 07:24.107
It's not us.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.779
It's being distributed in
African-American neighborhoods.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.038
Church parking lots.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.945
Makes no sense
for me to go there.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.902
Let me read it to you.
"Is she really..."

07:31.950 --> 07:32.917
Come on, Wendy.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.713
We're all adults.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.718
We all could have gone
into aluminum siding

07:36.750 --> 07:38.047
but we didn't--
we chose politics.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.058
I haven't gone there
with either of you.

07:40.090 --> 07:41.717
Well, congratulations.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.751
And I'm telling you
I didn't do it.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.751
Now tell me
why you're really here.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.598
I want a two-way race.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.598
I do, too.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.732
Peter's desperate.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.089
He's almost out of cash.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.233
People are dangerous
when they're desperate.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.238
Let's talk about it.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.206
There's certain things
I can't do.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.501
But I can?

08:05.750 --> 08:07.047
Yes, ma'am.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.809
_ MAN:
I was In the prIson yard,

08:08.850 --> 08:10.078
but I didn't see the attack.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.519
I already said all this.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.609
Yeah, we noticed your
parole hearing

08:13.660 --> 08:14.718
was in a week.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.649
We thought that might
jog your memory.

08:17.690 --> 08:18.987
Look,

08:19.030 --> 08:21.624
honestly,
I didn't see it happen.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.925
But... Church told me he did it.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.562
He told you?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.760
Yeah.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.165
I couldn't believe it.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.736
Take a chance like that

08:30.770 --> 08:32.704
with two weeks
left on your sentence?

08:32.740 --> 08:35.004
Why didn't you tell
the investigator before?

08:35.040 --> 08:36.644
He didn't ask.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.174
So why did Church do it?

08:39.210 --> 08:40.313
Did-did he say?

08:40.350 --> 08:43.547
Because of what Winston
called him.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.114
And what was that?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.859
(chuckles)

08:49.890 --> 08:51.858
The "N" word.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.552
So we have our motive.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.227
What?

08:56.260 --> 08:58.728
I love to see how uncomfortable
it makes you white folk.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.135
What?

09:00.170 --> 09:02.604
Am I not supposed to say
the "N" word anymore?

09:02.640 --> 09:05.336
No, it makes me feel
all warm and post-racial fuzzy.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.771
You know we have
a problem now.

09:08.810 --> 09:12.143
We have a motive,
but it's sympathetic.
How do you figure?

09:12.180 --> 09:13.818
There's four African-
Americans on the jury.

09:13.850 --> 09:17.638
Church just killed someone
who called him the "N" word.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.579
So how is it going
to go over with them?

09:46.850 --> 09:48.317
Ms. Scott-Carr.

09:48.350 --> 09:49.612
Mrs. Florrick.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.686
ALICIA:
I agree.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.688
It's appalling.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.928
My daughter brought it home
from school.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.383
She was crying.

09:59.430 --> 10:02.024
I held her for an hour.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.838
I'm sorry.
I'm really very sorry,

10:06.870 --> 10:09.759
but I think you need
to speak to my husband.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.631
Because you're just the wife?

10:12.680 --> 10:17.640
No. Because the campaign
is the campaign.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.210
Do you believe there are
certain things so...

10:23.250 --> 10:25.184
appamng,

10:25.220 --> 10:27.381
they're no longer
the campaign?

10:27.420 --> 10:29.411
Yes.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.691
But I also think
you are In a three-way race,

10:32.730 --> 10:34.652
and it's unclear
who did this.

10:36.930 --> 10:41.731
We're both mothers first,
aren't we?

10:41.770 --> 10:44.705
Professional women concerned
about the world, yes,

10:44.740 --> 10:48.301
but always our children
come before everything.

10:48.340 --> 10:51.741
I would do anything
for my daughters

10:51.780 --> 10:54.442
to see them not hurt,
to see them not crying.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.085
You're the same?

10:57.120 --> 10:58.747
Yes.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.426
It alleges that your son
got his girlfriend pregnant,

11:11.470 --> 11:14.394
and that your husband
paid for their abortion.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.396
I'm sure you join me

11:16.440 --> 11:20.001
in finding this appalling, too.

11:21.340 --> 11:23.740
And I'm sure
there's no truth to it,

11:23.780 --> 11:25.839
as there was none to this.

11:27.850 --> 11:32.139
I think President Obama
tagged this part

11:32.190 --> 11:34.852
of the campaign
as the silly season.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.729
It's an unfortunate
characterization,

11:38.760 --> 11:40.921
'cause I find nothing silly
about this.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.862
Next time you want
to come to my office,

11:47.900 --> 11:49.197
you make an appointment.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.874
As one mother to another,

11:52.910 --> 11:55.777
if you have any sway there,

11:55.810 --> 11:57.801
tell your campaign

11:57.850 --> 12:00.273
to stop this silliness.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.914
And I will make sure
your chIIdren

12:02.950 --> 12:04.941
don't come home crying.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.151
Good-bye.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.895
To a better future.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.892
(footsteps retreating)

12:27.240 --> 12:30.949
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

12:39.550 --> 12:40.949
GENEVA: Do you know
how patronizing this is?

12:40.990 --> 12:42.287
LANDRY:
I do, but is it true?

12:42.320 --> 12:43.252
So you think a white jury
wouldn't judge fairly

12:43.290 --> 12:45.485
because the
motIve. ..
That's different.

12:45.530 --> 12:47.452
There's no white equivalent
to the "N" word.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.250
Maybe there should be.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.961
CHILDS:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.524
So, you don't think we'll risk

12:51.570 --> 12:52.889
jury nullification
with this motive?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.134
GENEVA: I think we
can't generalize.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.229
I think people do things
for a lot of reasons,

12:56.270 --> 12:58.363
and I think a generalization
is being made here

12:58.410 --> 13:00.378
based on...
0.].

13:00.410 --> 13:01.877
Based on a false
generaIIzatIon

13:01.910 --> 13:05.073
of African-American overreaction
to a slur.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.548
This crime happened in prison.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.378
This wasn't a white wine
garden party, thIs was prIson.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.513
And I think we can argue,
pretty convincingly,

13:12.550 --> 13:15.951
that the "N" word is tossed off
with some frequency there.

13:15.990 --> 13:18.083
Then let's go with the "N" word.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.451
It explains why Church
would stab someone

13:20.500 --> 13:21.558
two weeks before release.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.522
Geneva, you do the questioning.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.993
With relish.
And one more thing.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.895
Mr. Agos had brought it
to my attention

13:27.940 --> 13:30.431
that a defense investigator's
had much success against us.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.461
So I am stepping up
our investigation

13:32.510 --> 13:33.431
into Kalinda Sharma.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.835
We believe the police
have leaked to her,

13:35.880 --> 13:38.474
judges have leaked to her,
and even some of our own.

13:38.510 --> 13:41.343
I want you to keep track
of all contact.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.587
We are going to
do our utmost

13:43.620 --> 13:46.248
to keep this a level
battlefield, okay?

13:46.290 --> 13:48.611
Good job, Cary.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.128
"Good job, Cary."

13:51.160 --> 13:54.425
You know how long I've worked
with him, and not a word?

13:54.460 --> 13:55.996
Good job, Geneva.

13:56.030 --> 13:59.124
Yup, it helps
to have a penis.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.035
The defense attorney
is Alicia Florrick.

14:01.070 --> 14:02.332
She's smart.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.031
She'll make
you like her.

14:04.070 --> 14:07.005
She'll ask if you've
been offered anything

14:07.040 --> 14:08.598
in exchange for
your testimony.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.006
You need to be able
to truthfully say no.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.018
So I'm going
to tell you

14:15.580 --> 14:18.617
We can't put in a good word

14:18.650 --> 14:21.050
at your next parole hearing.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.888
We can't trade you anything.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.921
Not now.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.060
Then she's gonna ask you,
what did

14:30.100 --> 14:31.226
I tell you next?

14:31.270 --> 14:32.965
And I need you to
remember something.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.137
(buzzer sounds)

14:34.170 --> 14:36.365
GENEVA:
What?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.607
Just give me a minute.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.664
(buzzer sounds)

14:43.550 --> 14:45.609
You going to get out?

14:47.650 --> 14:49.379
You need something?

14:49.420 --> 14:51.388
Yeah. Why are you following me?

14:51.420 --> 14:53.058
You?
Yeah.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.614
I'm not following you.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.457
Blake Calamar.

14:56.490 --> 14:59.482
You here for Lockhart/Gardner
or MS-13?

14:59.530 --> 15:03.591
Oh, you are working with some
old information there, buddy.

15:03.630 --> 15:06.190
Okay, well, I got some advice
for you, buddy.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.494
Don't follow me.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.168
I'm just standing
where I'm standing.

15:11.210 --> 15:15.670
I can make things difficult
for you for both your jobs.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.075
Oh, you don't want to do that.

15:17.110 --> 15:18.475
Actually, I do want
to do that.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.343
I just don't know
ifI need to.

15:23.650 --> 15:25.618
You don't carry a
gun, college boy.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.311
I don't need to.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.658
And you're a hell
of a long way from Baltimore.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.558
(phone ringing)

15:37.300 --> 15:39.268
Go for it.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.528
It's not mine.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.561
(phone continues ringing)

15:44.670 --> 15:46.365
Hello?

15:46.410 --> 15:48.105
Oh, hi, Ms. Lockhart.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.279
How are you today?

15:50.310 --> 15:51.743
Oh, no. I'm-I'm good.

15:51.780 --> 15:54.510
No, it's a great time.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.142
What can I do for you?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.009
What was that about?

15:59.050 --> 16:01.712
It's, uh, posturing.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.081
Lockhart/Gardner's
second investigator.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.451
They have two investigators
on a pro bono?

16:08.660 --> 16:11.766
We need help.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.598
GENEVA: So in your opinion,
Mr. Howell, there was a motive?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.609
HOWELL:
Well, yeah.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.665
He called him the
"N" word, so, sure.

16:19.710 --> 16:23.202
No further questions.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.775
(clearing her throat)

16:25.810 --> 16:30.281
Mr. Howell, you're in prison
for check kiting?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.514
Yes.

16:31.550 --> 16:32.687
And I really regret it.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.109
I got behind in my
bills, and you know,

16:35.160 --> 16:36.787
young, stupid mistake.

16:36.820 --> 16:39.220
Did Mr. Agos prep you
with that answer?

16:39.260 --> 16:40.397
Oh, sure.

16:40.430 --> 16:43.729
And...

16:43.770 --> 16:45.465
what did he ask you to say?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.468
Well, let me see
ifI can remember.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.764
He said to tell you that
I'd been offered nothing

16:49.800 --> 16:51.631
in exchange for my
testimony, and that...

16:51.670 --> 16:53.171
And when he...?
GENEVA:
Objection.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.132
Your Honor, Mrs. Florrick
didn't allow the witness

16:55.180 --> 16:56.306
to answer fully.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.149
Is that true,
Mr. Howell?

16:58.180 --> 16:59.772
Oh, yeah. It's a long answer.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.677
Conﬁnue.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.382
Well, then Mr. Agos said
you'd ask me

17:05.420 --> 17:07.285
an open-ended question
which would allow me

17:07.320 --> 17:09.709
to talk for a while
about my answer.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.648
Speaking from my heart,
I've been offered

17:11.690 --> 17:13.419
nothing in trade
for being here.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.553
My reasons are of
a personal nature.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.067
I found God
In prIson,

17:17.100 --> 17:19.489
and I'm remaking myself
in His image.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.236
It's allowed me to
look back on my life

17:21.270 --> 17:22.760
and realize where I've
strayed from the path.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.064
(sighs)

17:25.110 --> 17:26.759
I heard.

17:26.810 --> 17:28.778
The race card.

17:28.810 --> 17:30.675
Yes. They have their motive.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.507
The jury ate it up.

17:32.550 --> 17:33.676
And I walked

17:33.720 --> 17:35.244
right into a trap.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.078
Never ask _
an open-ended questIon.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.816
Okay, okay,
let me talk to Blake.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.179
Why?

17:42.220 --> 17:43.756
He may have something.

17:43.790 --> 17:44.779
I don't understand.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.422
It's okay. You don't have to.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.257
What do you mean?
I'm the lead attorney.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.291
Why wouldn't I have to?

18:09.320 --> 18:12.380
When you two decide on
the strategy, tell me.

18:12.420 --> 18:14.183
So what I'm saying is

18:14.220 --> 18:16.518
we are not made of money.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.381
Mrs. Florrick.
Hello.

18:19.430 --> 18:20.749
(quietly):
Xerox room?

18:22.730 --> 18:25.221
Uh, anyway, we need to make

18:25.270 --> 18:27.568
big moves with
little gestures.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.402
Mrs. Florrick,
this is a surprise.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.169
Stay there.

18:49.890 --> 18:52.324
I want to talk to you.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.658
No. It's Childs.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.258
This flyer was designed

18:56.300 --> 18:58.222
to undercut Wendy's
African-American base.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.295
That's not in Childs' interests.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.729
It is in ours. Peter's.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.806
Childs is looking toward
the endgame;

19:04.840 --> 19:06.467
votes are votes.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.671
He wants African-Americans
to sit on their hands.

19:08.710 --> 19:11.543
We have supporters...

19:11.580 --> 19:13.810
who are willing to do
what we want.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.670
As does Childs. As does Wendy.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.381
And you're in contact

19:17.420 --> 19:18.819
with them? With ours?

19:18.850 --> 19:21.250
Some, but I don't control them.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.798
Where did you get this?

19:31.830 --> 19:33.934
Wendy.

19:33.970 --> 19:35.665
She visited my office.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.634
Have you talked to Peter?
Not yet.

19:39.310 --> 19:40.902
I will take care of this.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.202
Do.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.312
Um, these would be helpful
to me.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.358
(children chattering)

19:53.390 --> 19:55.915
CARY:
That help we need,
we'll find it here.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.281
We find a five-year-old
investigator?

19:58.330 --> 19:59.957
Or a six-year-old.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.665
Andrew!

20:05.630 --> 20:07.860
No, no, no.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.834
(laughs) Yeah!

20:09.870 --> 20:12.930
The clarion
call of duty.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.404
The Innocence Project was
a million years ago.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.705
It was two years ago, and
you were the best one there.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.718
Yeah, well,
I'm Super Dad now, see?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.547
Nina's IPO goes
public next month.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.719
I don't need the sofa
change Cook County offers.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.718
Then do it for the fun.
Come on.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.718
You're not a
stay-at-home dad.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.978
Honey, go over there
and play, baby.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.328
Daddy needs to brush off
these nice people.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.897
Bryan Stone-- used to be
an airline executive

20:35.930 --> 20:38.728
until his wife
started a line of purses.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.897
Rodrigo Thorton just retired
from the Second Circuit.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.396
His wife invented
a computer app

20:42.440 --> 20:43.737
that just made its
first million.

20:43.770 --> 20:44.805
I'm in good company.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.307
You're being bred
like the Matrix.

20:46.340 --> 20:47.477
Yeah, well, let 'em.

20:47.510 --> 20:49.603
I'm tired of bringing
home the bacon.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.608
Come on.
We've got good dental.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.848
Come on in.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.313
You've seen this?
What Blake found?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.816
I have now.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.385
You think we should use it?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.648
I think I was told
to defer to the partners,

21:06.690 --> 21:07.952
so that's what I'll do.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.027
And if you weren't deferring?

21:12.730 --> 21:15.893
I_ would ask if
It were true.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.500
We're running into difficulties
with the original strategy.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.872
Yes, but if the new strategy
isn't true,

21:20.910 --> 21:22.707
it'll be easy to undercut.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.502
What do you think?

21:26.550 --> 21:29.018
I think we don't have
much choice.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.915
So you have no memory

21:30.950 --> 21:33.851
of Mr. Winston calling you
the "N" word?

21:33.890 --> 21:35.687
No. I mean,
I'm not saying he didn't,

21:35.720 --> 21:38.928
but, hey, if inmates killed
based on that,

21:38.960 --> 21:41.019
there'd be nobody left
in prison.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.528
Did anything unusual
happen the day before

21:43.570 --> 21:45.720
Mr. Winston was killed?
Yeah.

21:45.770 --> 21:47.533
A man visited me in prison.

21:47.570 --> 21:49.561
ALICIA:
What man?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.534
I don't know.
He was about mid-30s,

21:51.570 --> 21:53.106
white, five-ten.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.529
He was wearing a baseball cap.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.979
This man?

21:57.010 --> 21:58.079
Objection, Your Honor!

21:59.950 --> 22:01.440
Correctional Center
on July tenth.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.947
I'll allow.

22:02.980 --> 22:06.086
ALICIA:
And you had never
seen this man before?

22:06.120 --> 22:07.815
Neven

22:07.860 --> 22:10.624
Who's that in the photo
he's showing you?

22:10.660 --> 22:13.652
My daughter, Evie.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.622
She's ten months old.
Oh, hell.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.525
ALICIA:
And why did this man
show you a photo

22:17.570 --> 22:18.821
of our daughter?

22:19.830 --> 22:21.969
He said he'd kill her

22:22.000 --> 22:24.639
if I didn't do something
about Jay Winston.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.865
Mr. Church,

22:26.910 --> 22:28.832
did you kill Jay Winston?

22:28.880 --> 22:30.404
Yes.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.839
And why did you?

22:32.880 --> 22:35.917
CHURCH:
I'm sorry.

22:35.950 --> 22:38.919
(voice breaking):
I never hurted nobody
before ever, but...

22:38.950 --> 22:40.986
he had a photo
of my little girl.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.011
He...

22:43.060 --> 22:45.654
It was taken
from lnSIde my house.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.954
He said he'd kill
my whole family.

23:01.940 --> 23:03.100
It's not true.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.449
Okay, tell us.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.471
Tell you what,
that it's not true?

23:08.480 --> 23:09.913
It's not true.

23:09.950 --> 23:10.939
All of it?

23:10.990 --> 23:12.787
Yeah, all of it.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.084
Dad, they say things
about your campaign

23:15.120 --> 23:16.917
all the time.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.155
(sighs)
I know.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.397
And Becca, is she your...

23:22.860 --> 23:24.896
is she your girlfriend?
No.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.467
She was.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.592
Not anymore.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.164
You know, it's just that

23:30.200 --> 23:32.930
we never really talked
about it, Zach.

23:32.970 --> 23:34.779
Dad, please. It's okay.

23:34.810 --> 23:37.108
Well, you need
to protect yourself.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.903
Mom.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.145
Zach and I
talked last year

23:43.180 --> 23:46.115
when you were... away.

23:46.150 --> 23:48.186
I found condoms
in his backpack.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.710
Not mine.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.988
It's a friend's.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.952
And I kept them.

23:52.990 --> 23:56.198
And we were to talk if
he ever needed them.

23:57.830 --> 24:00.219
I know it's hard for
you to talk to us.

24:00.270 --> 24:02.238
But we're here.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.909
We're always
here for you.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.908
Okay.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.649
Hey, Dad,

24:11.680 --> 24:13.102
is it getting out?

24:13.150 --> 24:14.174
No.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.643
We're going to stop it.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.910
Thanks.

24:20.090 --> 24:21.910
(door closing)

24:21.960 --> 24:24.053
Well, that was a farce.

24:24.090 --> 24:26.126
Why? You don't believe him?

24:26.160 --> 24:29.197
Would you have
told your parents?

24:29.230 --> 24:31.221
We didn't tell
my parents.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.568
Christmas vacation--

24:33.600 --> 24:35.966
we were supposed to sleep
in separate rooms.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.605
Yeah, but we were a heck
of a lot older than Zach.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.871
And kids are growing up
a heck of a lot faster.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.678
Hey...

24:45.710 --> 24:48.611
you could have told me
about the condoms, you know.

24:48.650 --> 24:51.039
Yeah, I could have.

24:54.020 --> 24:56.215
I want to share
the bedroom again.

25:06.030 --> 25:08.931
I don't want my
parents' marriage.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.608
I don't either.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.674
Because I'm not
just a dad.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.132
I'm not just a man on your arm.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.546
And I'm not just your roommate.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.041
I know.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.139
So?

25:26.220 --> 25:29.053
I need to think.

25:35.330 --> 25:37.195
CARY:
So who is he?

25:37.230 --> 25:39.061
He had to sign in.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.124
We had to sign in.

25:40.170 --> 25:41.159
He did sign in--

25:41.200 --> 25:42.269
under an assumed name.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.801
Fake license.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.705
How is that possible?
It...

25:45.740 --> 25:47.162
(ringtone)
* Old MacDonald had a farm,
E-I-E-I-O *

25:47.210 --> 25:49.235
It isn't.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.702
Somebody made a mistake.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.978
Rita?

25:52.010 --> 25:54.069
Who? Who signed him in?

25:55.080 --> 25:57.048
No. The baby carrots.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.184
Just tell her the baby carrots
are a train.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.154
Yeah.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.878
Who signed him in?

26:03.930 --> 26:06.285
That's where_this
gets InterestIng.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.127
I don't remember much about him.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.697
I guess he used
a fake ID, huh?

26:10.730 --> 26:13.631
Yeah. So it's just...

26:13.670 --> 26:14.830
it's kind of odd.

26:14.870 --> 26:16.292
How many guards
are there here?

26:16.340 --> 26:19.309
285. 63 per shift.

26:19.340 --> 26:22.309
And yet, in the matter of one
week I've dealt with you twice.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.843
I don't understand.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.747
* Old MacDonald had a farm
I think what he means...
Oh, sorry.

26:27.780 --> 26:30.214
It's probably just...
It's nap time.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.808
Hold on, Rita.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.159
I think what he means is,

26:34.190 --> 26:36.181
not only were you turned the
wrong way during the murder,

26:36.220 --> 26:39.257
you're also the guard who let
the mystery baseball man in.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.351
Go ahead, Rita.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.324
So?

26:46.370 --> 26:48.759
Just interesting, isn't it?

26:48.800 --> 26:50.631
I find it so.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.771
This is not looking good.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.242
I know we don't consult.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.939
I know we don't coordinate.

27:05.990 --> 27:07.787
But if we had
a safe word,

27:07.820 --> 27:09.412
I would be screaming
it right now.

27:09.460 --> 27:11.223
You want me to stop
whipping you?

27:11.260 --> 27:12.921
Wendy Scott-Carr.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.292
The flyers involving
her white husband.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.821
I don't know if they're us,
but if they are, stop.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.269
You want to know
If they're us?

27:19.300 --> 27:21.768
No, but if they are,
I need them to stop.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.767
That would be consulting.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.233
Yes. Which I'm not doing.

27:24.270 --> 27:27.205
Okay, here's the problem.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.003
Do you want to know the problem?

27:30.010 --> 27:31.238
I can't stop,

27:31.280 --> 27:33.248
because they're not us.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.271
I don't believe you.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.446
That's your prerogative.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.846
I do know who they are, though.

27:38.890 --> 27:39.845
VVho?

27:39.890 --> 27:41.357
Your PAC.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.328
You took the money.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.295
They're insuring
their investment.

27:48.330 --> 27:49.957
You can tell
them to stop,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.195
but you're going to have
to find some new money.

27:52.230 --> 27:56.690
So we tell them to stop
with the racist flyers,

27:56.740 --> 28:00.232
they take away the money and our
campaign is out of business.

28:00.270 --> 28:02.306
Yep, that's about it.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.803
But who _said
a conSCIence Is cheap?

28:09.320 --> 28:10.412
CARY:
What's this?

28:10.450 --> 28:12.782
ANDREW:
Prison guard's work history.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.219
Look at his job two years ago.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.455
CARY:
Leacrest Stables.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.287
Lemond Bishop.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.422
He owns them.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.791
GENEVA:
But I don't get it.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.798
Why would Lemond Bishop
want Winston dead?

28:22.830 --> 28:24.468
Here, halfway down the page.

28:24.500 --> 28:25.990
Transfer notice.

28:26.030 --> 28:27.361
Winston was to be transferred

28:27.400 --> 28:29.288
to a courthouse holding cell
for a week.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.329
For questioning?

28:30.370 --> 28:31.337
It doesn't say.

28:31.370 --> 28:32.439
Spilling to the Feds.

28:32.470 --> 28:33.835
Let's say Winston has

28:33.880 --> 28:35.370
dirt on Lemond Bishop.
GIRL:
Daddy.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.298
Now, if I were...

28:37.340 --> 28:38.477
Hello.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.239
IfI were Lemond Bishop,

28:40.280 --> 28:43.340
then I would want to get
rid of him, wouldn't I?

28:43.380 --> 28:46.486
So we have to prove Church
wasn't just a pawn.

28:47.450 --> 28:48.849
He was part of it.

28:48.890 --> 28:50.858
No, we just have to go out
just for a few minutes

28:50.890 --> 28:52.426
to do a little research,
don't we?

28:52.460 --> 28:53.427
And then we'll be back.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.849
(imitating engine rewing
and horn honking)

28:55.900 --> 28:57.788
(girls chatting)

29:01.570 --> 29:02.889
Yeah.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.066
Oh, really?

29:04.110 --> 29:05.361
Oh, Mr. Gold.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.934
Becca. Thank you, ladies.

29:06.970 --> 29:08.403
See ya.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.509
are—é:

29:12.480 --> 29:15.074
You seem... upset.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.441
How is it

29:17.480 --> 29:19.914
that I can manage
aldermen and judges

29:19.950 --> 29:21.508
and yet I still seem to have

29:21.560 --> 29:25.052
this ridiculous little
mean gIrl thorn In my shoe.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.921
Maybe you're secretly in love.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.097
(chuckles)

29:28.130 --> 29:29.392
Here's the thing.

29:29.430 --> 29:30.863
I'm not going to ask,

29:30.900 --> 29:32.424
'cause I know
you'll only he,

29:32.470 --> 29:33.562
and that's okay.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.568
It actually makes
things easier.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.090
What things?

29:37.140 --> 29:41.304
When you're asked,
you did not sleep with Zach.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.876
You did not
hook up with him.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.242
You did not have an abortion.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.305
You don't have to think.
Just say yes.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.910
Yes.

29:49.950 --> 29:52.145
And what if I did?
What if you did what?

29:52.190 --> 29:54.488
Slept with Zach,
and had an abortion?

29:56.590 --> 29:59.559
Then we'd have to discuss
what was provable.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.388
Lake Drive Health Center.

30:02.430 --> 30:04.466
I was there on May 18th.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.320
Oops.

30:06.370 --> 30:08.463
Does that make your job harder?

30:08.500 --> 30:10.491
Listen...

30:10.540 --> 30:13.134
No, Mr. Gold, I'm
tired of listening.

30:13.170 --> 30:14.569
Have Zach phone me.

30:14.610 --> 30:15.599
I like Zach.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.130
I don't want to make
his life harder.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.171
I want to make it easier.

30:19.210 --> 30:23.146
May 18th. Hmm.

30:23.180 --> 30:25.978
Working back,
you weren't showing,

30:26.020 --> 30:28.352
so that_means _
a March, AprII conceptIon.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.589
That's when you were
sleeping with Mr. Hock--

30:32.630 --> 30:35.497
you're after-school
college prep tutor.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.128
Yes. Appalling, isn't it?

30:40.170 --> 30:42.468
I investigate my opponents.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.934
Too bad you don't have
the resources to do the same.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.359
So...

30:47.410 --> 30:50.868
whenever anyone asks
whether you slept with Zach,

30:50.910 --> 30:52.377
what do you say?

30:54.220 --> 30:55.642
It's very easy.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.477
I know, given your history,

30:57.520 --> 30:59.647
it's probably
a new word for you,

30:59.690 --> 31:01.282
but you say no.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.622
Let's try it.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.552
No.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.919
Good.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.928
Always lovely, Becca.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.675
Hi.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.577
What's up?

31:27.610 --> 31:30.113
Just saying hello.

31:31.150 --> 31:34.153
Kalinda, why don't...

31:36.360 --> 31:40.148
I want to talk to you,
but I'm going to head out.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.462
CARY:
You're being investigated.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.922
What?

31:46.970 --> 31:48.164
Childs.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.191
You're doing
too well.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.938
It won't be_ much
of an InvestIgatIon,

31:53.980 --> 31:55.971
'cause I haven't
done anythIng wrong.

31:56.010 --> 31:58.501
A lot of people
leak to you.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.678
Yeah, friends.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.540
Yeah. Well,

32:03.580 --> 32:05.548
they're going to be scarce.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.559
Does that mean you as well?

32:10.560 --> 32:12.619
What are you guys
doing with Bishop?

32:12.660 --> 32:15.424
I thought Will and Diane
backed away from him.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.098
Yeah, they did.

32:17.130 --> 32:18.722
The Church defense?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.489
It's not some little
pro bono, Is It?

32:21.540 --> 32:24.668
You don't put two investigators
on a pro bono.

32:26.470 --> 32:29.735
I, um, I don't know.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.748
You know what I think?

32:31.780 --> 32:34.544
I think you guys
are auditioning for Bishop.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.652
Bishop?

32:46.690 --> 32:48.248
Yep.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.621
I thought we
were out of

32:50.660 --> 32:52.560
the drug kingpin
business.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.431
He lost his previous
representation,

32:54.470 --> 32:57.769
and my guess is,
it's too lucrative.

32:57.800 --> 33:01.600
Do you ever feel like
we're not the wrong side?

33:01.640 --> 33:03.631
Mmm. All the time.

33:05.180 --> 33:08.013
Maybe it's not bad.

33:08.050 --> 33:11.383
There are 44
equ partners.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.684
We need 23 to vote Bond out.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.188
He has 22 certain votes.

33:16.220 --> 33:17.380
No, 28.

33:17.420 --> 33:18.626
How do you figure?

33:18.660 --> 33:19.627
His people...

33:19.660 --> 33:21.799
plus the people in Litigation
we pissed off.

33:21.830 --> 33:25.163
24 maybe.
And they may not be so certain

33:25.200 --> 33:27.566
if they knew that Bond
was making a deal

33:27.600 --> 33:28.737
with a drug kingpin.

33:28.770 --> 33:30.237
Or they may be more certain.

33:30.270 --> 33:31.703
It's a new economy.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.402
That's what the Joey Church
defense was about, right?

33:34.440 --> 33:36.670
We represent Church
to gain favor with Bishop.

33:36.710 --> 33:39.372
Yep, we successfully defend

33:39.410 --> 33:41.378
a Bishop lieutenant,
he swings business our way.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.217
It's a_smart m_ove.
BrIngs In a fast Influx.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.548
_So_ we need to start
|InIng up votes now.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.050
We can't be seen
together so much.

33:51.090 --> 33:52.648
He'll get suspicious.
Yep. I'll talk to you later.

33:52.690 --> 33:54.419
It's money,

33:56.830 --> 33:58.661
You can do better. Do it!

33:58.700 --> 34:00.691
BOND:
Don't worry.

34:00.730 --> 34:04.632
Internecine warfare _creates
healthy competItIon.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.467
Hey, I know it
from my business.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.637
Show me results
and I'm happy.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.705
Okay, Andrew, we're freezing
our asses off out here.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.174
Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey!

34:13.210 --> 34:14.768
All right, all right, sorry.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.709
What did you find?
Okay.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.684
Joey Church.

34:19.720 --> 34:20.812
Good respectable dad.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.283
Good respectable
meth habit.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.685
No apparent connection
to Mr. Bishop.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.585
Never worked for him.
Never bought from him.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.825
They move in completely
different circles.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.657
I'm not seeing
much good here.

34:29.700 --> 34:31.429
Hey! Hey, slow down!

34:31.470 --> 34:32.619
(tires screech)

34:32.670 --> 34:35.798
Oh, you're gonna stop?

34:37.400 --> 34:38.662
So if you're gonna drive...

34:38.710 --> 34:40.234
MAN:
Shove it!

34:44.650 --> 34:47.847
Ever hear of Northbrook
Youth Soccer?

34:47.880 --> 34:50.519
Are you talking to us?

34:50.550 --> 34:51.847
Northbrook, kids
soccer league?

34:51.890 --> 34:53.744
Okay, I haven't heard of it,
but I imagine it exists.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.859
Tree Frogs. It's Youth Soccer.

34:56.890 --> 34:58.653
It's 2006.

34:58.690 --> 35:01.523
Wasn't a very
good year for them.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.619
Five losses,
three wins.

35:03.660 --> 35:04.763
Look who the coach is.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.564
GENEVA:
That's Joey Church.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.692
See, here's the thing--
Hey, Brian.

35:08.740 --> 35:09.889
I got a vehicle
behind on tickets.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.261
It's a gray Lexus, 2009.

35:12.310 --> 35:15.905
Plate is 9-Texas-
Howard-2304.

35:15.940 --> 35:17.430
(both chuckles)

35:17.480 --> 35:19.368
No, he needs a wheel lock.

35:19.410 --> 35:22.447
Yeah, right.
Thanks.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.289
I never want you
as an enemy, man.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.743
So I'm looking at this
photo, it occurs to me;

35:26.790 --> 35:27.882
the sponsor...

35:27.920 --> 35:30.309
Fast & Elegant Dry Cleaners.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.282
Bishop.
Yep.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.729
It's one
of his legit businesses.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.159
Before Church got

35:35.200 --> 35:37.293
into trouble, he was coaching
his son's team,

35:37.330 --> 35:39.389
and he solicited Bishop
for sponsorship.

35:39.430 --> 35:42.467
So we can show
they knew each other.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.296
CHILDS:
Are you sure?

35:43.340 --> 35:45.308
CARY:
As far as we can tell, yes.

35:45.340 --> 35:46.762
Church was in league
with Bishop.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.675
We could turn him.

35:48.710 --> 35:49.938
Get him to testify
against Bishop.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.608
Work up the pyramid.

35:53.650 --> 35:54.912
Just so we're clear.

35:54.950 --> 35:57.771
We've built a very strong
case against Church.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.481
Yes, but Church
is a small fish.

35:59.520 --> 36:01.249
Bishop is the whopper.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.212
A whopper you spent
the last five years
trying to land.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.353
And now we have
_ new Me.
By deCImatIng our case?

36:05.390 --> 36:06.755
No, by turning
the case.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.223
You've already turned
a half dozen cases,

36:08.260 --> 36:09.329
and where are you?

36:09.360 --> 36:12.397
Okay, let us discuss it.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.591
Sir, you have the dispo dump
coming up.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.699
We can nail Church.
You can't nail Bishop.

36:18.270 --> 36:19.635
Give me a minute.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.737
You, too. Just one minute.

36:29.980 --> 36:33.279
I need you to talk to the
investigators about Kalinda.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.550
Why?

36:35.590 --> 36:37.808
They just need some confirmation
about a few things.

36:37.860 --> 36:41.296
We've been slipped some
anonymous information about her.

36:41.330 --> 36:42.524
What information?

36:42.560 --> 36:43.857
She's been lying under oath,

36:43.900 --> 36:45.765
testifying under
an assumed name.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.825
Well, I don't know anything
about that.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.293
But you can offer a background.

36:52.770 --> 36:54.601
Yeah, all right.

36:54.640 --> 36:59.600
Good. I've been working on some
budgetary maneuvers right now.

36:59.650 --> 37:03.416
I should know very quickly
ifI can improve your position.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.812
I just wanted to
drop by and say...

37:07.850 --> 37:10.956
What?

37:12.360 --> 37:13.987
There was no abortion.

37:14.030 --> 37:16.851
Not with Zach.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.561
How do you know?

37:18.600 --> 37:20.921
She was with somebody else.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.667
(sighs)

37:24.710 --> 37:28.601
I am sorry about all this
in your life.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.374
Thank you.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.719
Eli, thank you.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.445
Hey.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.350
And we had nothing to do
with the Wendy flyer.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.880
It was our PAC.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.980
And we don't have any
control over them.

37:47.030 --> 37:51.524
So is Wendy still putting out
the Zach flyer?

37:51.570 --> 37:53.697
If our PAC goes forward,
then Wendy does, too?

37:53.730 --> 37:55.038
No.

37:55.070 --> 37:57.834
Peter told the PAC
to get lost.

37:57.870 --> 37:59.508
He...?

37:59.540 --> 38:00.564
VVhen?

38:00.610 --> 38:02.669
Tonight.

38:02.710 --> 38:05.941
So that means...?

38:05.980 --> 38:09.017
(chuckles)
We're bankrupt.

38:18.460 --> 38:19.984
He's here on
a grand jury subpoena.

38:20.030 --> 38:21.054
Different case.

38:21.090 --> 38:21.988
Does he know anything?

38:22.030 --> 38:24.021
No.

38:32.570 --> 38:34.299
Yeah, more later.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.678
You want something?

38:39.710 --> 38:41.644
Nope, but you might.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.978
I always want something.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.580
Joey Church.

38:48.590 --> 38:50.888
Okay, I'm listening.

38:57.130 --> 38:59.621
And who is that, Mr. Bishop?
That man there in
the baseball cap?

38:59.670 --> 39:02.867
Yes, sir.
That's one of my associates
from California,

39:02.900 --> 39:05.630
a Mr. Harden.
Again, objection, Your Honor.

39:05.670 --> 39:08.059
You will have a chance _to
cross-examIne, Ms. FlorrIck,

39:08.110 --> 39:11.807
and the jury will have
a chance to judge the
veracity of Mr. Bishop.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.499
I can't wait.

39:16.050 --> 39:19.645
And that photo
your associate is carrying,

39:19.690 --> 39:21.817
that is Mr. Church's daughter?

39:21.860 --> 39:23.418
BISHOP:
Yes.

39:28.530 --> 39:29.599
And why is he
doing that?

39:29.630 --> 39:31.427
I sent him there.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.098
Mr. Church was worried about
whether his family was being

39:34.130 --> 39:35.995
taken care of_whi|e
he was In prIson.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.565
I wanted my associate
to assure him they were.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.534
And when you say
"taken care of"?

39:41.580 --> 39:43.878
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

39:43.910 --> 39:46.549
No, not "taken care of."

39:46.580 --> 39:49.174
Supported.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.017
(both laugh)

39:51.050 --> 39:52.881
So there was no
threat to Mr. Church

39:52.920 --> 39:54.785
like the defense is claiming?

39:54.820 --> 39:56.117
No, not at all.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.013
We were merely calming his fears

39:57.060 --> 39:58.618
about his family's
security and health.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.424
And so there was no
pressure on Mr. Church

40:01.460 --> 40:03.451
to commit a crime
that he already admitted?

40:03.500 --> 40:04.728
That's correct.
Thank you.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.590
JUDGE:
Do you have anything else,
Counselor?

40:06.630 --> 40:08.837
No, ma'am.
I think that'll be enough.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.700
LANDRY:
What the hell did you do?

40:12.740 --> 40:14.162
Got a conviction for
ﬁrst degree murder.

40:14.210 --> 40:15.700
You sandbagged me.

40:15.740 --> 40:17.105
Your case was on
the docket for years.

40:17.140 --> 40:18.744
I cleared mine in a week.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.202
By overstepping your authority.

40:20.250 --> 40:24.584
We were gonna use Church
to get to Bishop.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.611
Good luck.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.491
I don't want you to go anywhere.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.968
(chuckles)
Well, I don't want
to go anywhere.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.501
I'd like to make you an offer.

40:50.180 --> 40:52.603
I'd like that.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.142
Hey, Kalinda?

41:07.230 --> 41:08.891
So, Canada, huh?

41:08.930 --> 41:10.192
Excuse me?

41:10.230 --> 41:11.697
(laughs)
I was such an idiot.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.527
I was looking
on the West Coast.

41:13.570 --> 41:14.696
Don't ask me why.
I'm sorry.

41:14.740 --> 41:15.991
What is it you want?

41:16.040 --> 41:18.235
Leela Tahiri.

41:18.270 --> 41:20.204
Um, she died
in a Toronto house fire,

41:20.240 --> 41:22.174
like, eight years ago.
The body was never found.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.576

WIth the cops.

41:24.610 --> 41:27.773
I'm still trying
to work out the details.

So that's me?

41:29.220 --> 41:31.586
That's my surmise.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.212
Am I wrong?

41:33.250 --> 41:36.151
I think you need to find that
out for yourself.
