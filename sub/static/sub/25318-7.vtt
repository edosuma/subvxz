00:08.507 --> 00:11.544
None of us were much familiar
with this Aleister Crowley.

00:11.577 --> 00:13.346
I'm just glad he lives so far away.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.349
He's not as far as you'd think.

00:18.979 --> 00:20.474
Be careful with the pages

00:20.499 --> 00:22.502
and be sure to close
them when you're done.

00:32.150 --> 00:33.600
<i>Keep pure</i>

00:33.925 --> 00:36.301
your highest ideal.

00:36.469 --> 00:40.140
Strive ever toward it
without allowing aught

00:40.173 --> 00:43.109
to stop you or turn you aside,

00:43.349 --> 00:46.368
even as a star sweeps upon

00:46.393 --> 00:49.385
<i>its infinite and incalculable</i>

00:49.410 --> 00:50.716
<i>course of glory.</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:53.853
Love is the law.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.657
Love under will.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.744
<i>Your minerval has earned the right</i>

01:06.769 --> 01:09.605
To partake of the workings.

01:12.678 --> 01:14.582
It means you can stay.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.522
The key of the rituals
is in the secret word,

01:30.583 --> 01:33.184
which I have given unto you.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.079
Love is the law.

01:42.615 --> 01:44.517
Love under will.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.783
Do what thou wilt, Jack.

01:57.981 --> 01:59.945
That's why we're here.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.822
Are you ready?

02:04.134 --> 02:05.792
What is it I should be ready for?

02:05.825 --> 02:08.461
Sacrifice and ascension.

02:08.604 --> 02:09.805
Love is the law.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.029
Love under will.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.918
By uniting with the eternal
force of creation,

02:33.676 --> 02:36.120
we bend the world to our will.

05:45.548 --> 05:47.282
I've put everything on the line now.

05:47.325 --> 05:49.982
The master tells us sacrifice
is what's required.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.269
Don't tell me you didn't enjoy it.

05:52.496 --> 05:53.920
That's not the point.

05:54.144 --> 05:56.656
When's the world gonna
start bending to my will?

05:57.192 --> 05:59.217
Well, it was only your first
time with a high priestess.

05:59.242 --> 06:01.002
You've barely scratched the surface.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.663
General Braxton's only in town
till the end of the week.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.432
You keep trying to play a game
that's rigged against you.

06:07.732 --> 06:08.967
Doesn't matter.

06:09.224 --> 06:10.542
I still need to win.

06:10.628 --> 06:12.865
But you don't get it. Why
suck up to a general

06:12.890 --> 06:14.786
with only two stars when
there's a million of 'em

06:14.811 --> 06:17.547
out there waiting for you?

06:21.505 --> 06:23.321
- All right.
- Careful.

07:57.610 --> 07:58.809
Susan.

07:58.863 --> 07:59.946
I was just thinking,

07:59.989 --> 08:01.980
I've barely seen you
since our camping trip.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.584
Oh, I know. I've been so busy.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.819
It'd be nice to catch
up, just the two of us.

08:07.232 --> 08:09.228
Figure we're overdue.

08:10.432 --> 08:13.409
I brought lemonade with a
little something extra.

08:13.812 --> 08:15.047
Please.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.481
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.435
Sorry, sir. Demonstration in progress.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.994
I'm looking for my partner.

08:52.134 --> 08:55.167
How long is the demo gonna be?

08:59.170 --> 09:02.006
Jack. Jack. Wait.

09:02.173 --> 09:03.540
- What's going on?
- We've got a meeting

09:03.565 --> 09:05.526
- With Professor Mesulam.
- That's on Tuesday.

09:05.551 --> 09:07.185
It <i>is</i> Tuesday, Richard.

09:07.933 --> 09:09.703
Oh.

09:10.636 --> 09:12.175
Goddamn it.

09:13.431 --> 09:15.063
I'm sorry.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.129
Working both these projects...
it's just killing me.

09:18.256 --> 09:20.066
- Is General Braxton in there?
- Yeah.

09:20.112 --> 09:21.680
Why don't you show him our film?

09:22.961 --> 09:24.830
We had our chance.

09:25.033 --> 09:26.857
Braxton has written our project off.

09:26.952 --> 09:29.176
He hasn't seen any of our
latest work in the arroyo.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.825
- Mr. Onsted.
- Yeah?

09:30.995 --> 09:33.340
The general is asking if
you'll be much longer.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.407
Um, I'll be right there, sir.

09:42.511 --> 09:44.792
Is there any way we can reschedule?

09:45.905 --> 09:48.206
No. I can see you're busy.

10:11.549 --> 10:13.412
It's incredible, right?

10:14.051 --> 10:16.818
Please tell me what is incredible?

10:17.098 --> 10:18.897
You just witnessed gas exhaust speeds

10:18.922 --> 10:21.179
in excess of 5,000 miles an hour.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.205
Would you like to watch it again?

10:23.242 --> 10:25.879
- Yeah, yeah.
- No need, Alice.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.372
Where is Richard?

10:32.575 --> 10:34.978
He's splitting his time
with another project.

10:35.455 --> 10:36.676
And without Richard,

10:36.701 --> 10:38.888
the rest of the team's
not showing up, either.

10:39.317 --> 10:42.455
But the work you are
doing is very dangerous.

10:42.621 --> 10:44.390
You shouldn't be out there alone.

10:44.449 --> 10:46.710
I'm not. There's the guy
holding the camera.

10:47.205 --> 10:50.318
The project needs to keep moving
forward with or without Richard.

10:50.785 --> 10:52.509
Back in Europe,

10:53.345 --> 10:55.848
I too worked with a friend.

10:56.054 --> 10:57.550
Max Schull.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.326
We shared our love of aeronautics,

11:01.806 --> 11:04.077
worked on PUZ 1 together.

11:04.355 --> 11:07.357
But as the Nazis rose in power,

11:07.524 --> 11:10.185
suddenly my university was worried, uh,

11:10.210 --> 11:13.167
they had too many Jewish professors.

11:13.264 --> 11:16.433
Max had already secured a chair,

11:17.434 --> 11:19.846
but I was denied mine.

11:20.746 --> 11:22.746
And no one protested.

11:23.008 --> 11:25.109
Not even Max.

11:25.395 --> 11:27.390
I called him coward.

11:27.879 --> 11:29.827
I said many horrible things.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.724
He and I haven't spoken since.

11:41.306 --> 11:44.609
Given state of the world,
we may never speak again.

11:44.716 --> 11:46.908
Why are you telling me this?

11:47.126 --> 11:50.195
<i>Uno Ne Peleya Sino Dos.</i>

11:51.282 --> 11:54.321
It's an old Ladino saying meaning,

11:54.346 --> 11:57.349
"it takes two to have argument."

11:57.929 --> 12:00.744
Without Richard, you are like

12:00.832 --> 12:03.421
car with gas pedal

12:03.446 --> 12:04.702
but no brake.

12:04.727 --> 12:06.461
The military is about
to pick the projects

12:06.486 --> 12:08.244
they're bringing to D.C.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.403
Now is not the time to slow down.

12:10.508 --> 12:12.978
There will be other opportunities.

12:13.052 --> 12:15.086
When?

12:15.467 --> 12:17.760
I'm not about to give
up on this chance.

12:20.155 --> 12:23.343
These equations prove
a solid-fuel rocket

12:23.368 --> 12:25.388
can burn stable.

12:26.611 --> 12:30.807
But you will need to work with
Richard to understand them.

12:32.349 --> 12:33.601
<i>Look at you...</i>

12:33.707 --> 12:36.602
Making cocktails in the
middle of the afternoon.

12:37.095 --> 12:40.065
I knew there was more to Susan
Parsons than met the eye.

12:40.671 --> 12:42.694
Perhaps.

12:43.308 --> 12:45.585
But I'm not the only
one keeping secrets.

12:48.210 --> 12:49.301
Forgive me.

12:49.379 --> 12:51.715
What secrets are you referring to?

13:02.487 --> 13:03.934
What's this?

13:04.967 --> 13:06.918
I know Jack's been going.

13:08.209 --> 13:09.513
Going where?

13:09.646 --> 13:11.990
To that house, with Ernest.

13:12.411 --> 13:15.314
Question is, do they know
what they've been going to?

13:17.936 --> 13:20.071
It's about the man who started Thelema,

13:20.477 --> 13:22.310
this Crowley.

13:22.824 --> 13:24.917
The paper makes him
out to be a monster.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.774
They say he's seduced young girls,

13:26.799 --> 13:29.814
that he practices animal sacrifice,

13:30.181 --> 13:31.255
even bestiality.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.764
Mm, I know what it says.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.647
Is it true?

13:36.281 --> 13:38.033
Ernest would say

13:38.142 --> 13:41.345
it's all propaganda spread
by Crowley's enemies.

13:41.399 --> 13:44.937
People who are afraid of freedom.

13:46.171 --> 13:47.339
What do you think?

13:50.629 --> 13:52.264
Does it matter what I think?

13:56.039 --> 13:58.208
Why not ask your husband?

14:01.162 --> 14:03.742
Because I need to know
what I'm up against first.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.915
The truth is even worse.

14:11.514 --> 14:13.447
That mass you saw...

14:13.605 --> 14:15.120
That's just the beginning.

14:15.207 --> 14:17.843
The high priest... Alfred... he...

14:17.876 --> 14:20.454
he claims monogamy's a form of slavery,

14:20.518 --> 14:23.354
that no one owns anyone else.

14:24.629 --> 14:26.219
He separates couples,

14:26.244 --> 14:29.647
makes them switch with each other.

14:30.729 --> 14:33.261
It's not just husbands
with other wives.

14:33.286 --> 14:36.524
It's... wives with wives

14:36.560 --> 14:38.429
and men with men.

14:38.702 --> 14:41.513
Three at a time. More.

14:41.689 --> 14:43.215
How do you know all this?

14:46.418 --> 14:47.949
How do you think?

14:49.022 --> 14:50.655
You've been going?

14:52.357 --> 14:56.128
Ernest can't seem to live without it.

14:58.503 --> 15:01.438
And I can't seem to live without him.

15:07.918 --> 15:11.958
So... now that you know
what you're up against,

15:11.983 --> 15:13.685
are you gonna confront him?

15:19.677 --> 15:21.104
Susan?

15:25.797 --> 15:27.994
- What are you two doing?
- Mm.

15:28.092 --> 15:29.560
Oh, just catching up,

15:30.076 --> 15:31.156
talking about how we've been

15:31.181 --> 15:32.949
spending our evenings.

15:33.097 --> 15:35.567
You, me, Jack.

15:37.949 --> 15:39.099
You're drunk.

15:39.175 --> 15:40.325
So?

15:41.470 --> 15:43.308
What if I felt like being drunk?

15:43.378 --> 15:45.252
Sorry, Susan, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

15:45.296 --> 15:47.266
I was just going.

16:27.337 --> 16:28.897
What'd you tell her?

16:30.583 --> 16:31.916
Maggie.

16:36.967 --> 16:38.602
What do you think?

16:40.507 --> 16:42.755
I see the way you look at him.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.398
Who?

16:45.756 --> 16:47.964
Don't play dumb. You know.

16:50.862 --> 16:51.991
Or do you really expect me

16:52.016 --> 16:54.670
to believe that you suddenly
care so much about rockets?

16:54.699 --> 16:56.434
You wouldn't understand.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.723
Then explain it to me.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.446
Alfred thinks that Jack

17:07.311 --> 17:09.513
could be the key to
unlocking my true self.

17:09.587 --> 17:11.344
He thinks he...

17:11.585 --> 17:13.114
might be my liberation.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.531
From what?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.440
All of this time,

17:21.904 --> 17:25.411
everything I've done for you, for us...

17:25.443 --> 17:29.381
I never wanted you to do
anything you did not want to.

17:29.694 --> 17:32.094
What choice did I have?

17:32.204 --> 17:34.423
Be true to yourself!

17:35.260 --> 17:37.529
That's the whole goddamn point!

17:44.796 --> 17:46.236
If you're feeling unhappy...

17:46.284 --> 17:48.916
I can't just leave.

17:51.181 --> 17:53.884
Not without knowing the truth.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.691
Ernest, please.

18:01.433 --> 18:03.654
We're not like the Parsons.

18:04.220 --> 18:05.400
We don't...

18:05.438 --> 18:07.837
we don't hide things from each other.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.176
Just please tell me what's
really going on with you.

18:21.091 --> 18:24.696
Whatever it is you think I am, I'm not.

18:47.678 --> 18:49.013
Richard?

18:51.082 --> 18:53.201
What are you doing here?

18:53.606 --> 18:56.509
Just found out that Braxton
selected the project

18:56.534 --> 18:59.411
he's gonna be submitting
to his superiors in D.C.

18:59.965 --> 19:02.963
Professor Tillman's new
prototype is one of them.

19:02.988 --> 19:04.756
And they're all meeting
at the Ath tonight

19:04.781 --> 19:06.349
to finalize the details.

19:07.893 --> 19:10.230
If the propeller project gets funded,

19:10.441 --> 19:12.611
it's gonna require more of my time.

19:15.579 --> 19:17.248
More or all?

19:19.284 --> 19:21.085
I'm really sorry.

19:23.020 --> 19:26.377
Mesulam sponsored this
project because of you.

19:28.246 --> 19:30.381
If you leave, it's over.

19:30.495 --> 19:32.460
Right now I need to focus on my future.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.572
Rockets <i>are</i> the future.

19:49.515 --> 19:51.656
It's Frater J.P.

19:54.619 --> 19:56.587
Please, it's an emergency.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.797
Tell me what you want.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.281
To manifest my will.

20:29.253 --> 20:31.254
Don't look at me.

20:34.179 --> 20:36.181
Tell me what you want.

20:37.346 --> 20:40.310
To manifest my will.

20:42.219 --> 20:44.221
Focus on your intention.

20:54.051 --> 20:56.150
Free your mind.

20:57.777 --> 20:59.837
And it will break through

21:00.238 --> 21:02.240
everything that stands in your way.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.266
<i>Just free your mind.</i>

21:37.354 --> 21:40.991
<i>The barriers you feel are illusory.</i>

21:41.066 --> 21:42.733
<i>Just free your mind</i>

21:43.146 --> 21:45.388
<i>and it will break through</i>

21:45.470 --> 21:46.770
<i>everything that stands in your way.</i>

21:46.884 --> 21:48.171
<i>It will break through</i>

21:48.196 --> 21:49.646
<i>everything that stands in your way.</i>

22:22.783 --> 22:25.109
<i>Yes. Oh!</i>

23:15.527 --> 23:18.497
Why don't you
pick me up in an hour, all right?

23:18.562 --> 23:20.564
Yes, sir.

23:26.350 --> 23:28.252
- Gentlemen.
- Evening.

23:28.439 --> 23:29.708
Evening.

23:51.603 --> 23:53.505
Damn it.

24:21.457 --> 24:22.691
Evening, sir.

24:22.755 --> 24:25.023
Will you be joining the
others for cigars and brandy?

24:26.092 --> 24:27.519
Yes.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.566
- Yes, I will.
- Very good.

24:29.595 --> 24:31.821
They've already retired
down to the Rathskeller.

24:31.996 --> 24:33.998
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.119
Those islands in the Pacific...

24:50.144 --> 24:51.612
They are damn tiny.

24:52.764 --> 24:55.136
General, if the results hold,
we may even squeeze out

24:55.161 --> 24:57.127
an extra four percent in
propeller efficiency.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.928
A whole four percent?

25:00.097 --> 25:01.665
I thought the military was on campus

25:01.700 --> 25:04.040
to find cutting-edge technology.

25:04.161 --> 25:06.798
Four percent sounds a little tame.

25:06.971 --> 25:08.734
I'm sorry for the intrusion, General.

25:08.759 --> 25:11.462
Jack Parsons, from the
GALCIT Rocketry Group.

25:11.955 --> 25:13.198
Good to see you again.

25:13.223 --> 25:16.426
Ah, the admirers of von Braun.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.614
Oh, we've come a long way since then.

25:19.323 --> 25:22.281
- Jack, this is, uh...
- Correct me if I'm wrong Professor...

25:22.306 --> 25:24.901
but there's an upward
limit to propeller speed?

25:24.926 --> 25:26.781
Around 500 miles per hour?

25:27.358 --> 25:30.439
We're not gonna stand here and
listen to this charlatan.

25:30.579 --> 25:31.863
Is that right, John?

25:32.474 --> 25:34.164
Well, yes.

25:34.431 --> 25:35.700
Technically. But...

25:35.733 --> 25:36.877
Funny thing is,

25:36.902 --> 25:39.338
just the other day,
we had a rocket reach

25:39.418 --> 25:42.520
5,000 miles per hour
in exhaust velocity,

25:42.545 --> 25:44.215
and we have the footage to prove it.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.778
That's it. Find someone
to show him the door.

25:46.928 --> 25:49.013
You were telling us that von
Braun is trying to hit London

25:49.047 --> 25:50.698
with rockets from Berlin.

25:50.989 --> 25:53.892
Well, we're aiming much, much further.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.771
Where to?

25:55.800 --> 25:56.950
The moon.

26:00.401 --> 26:03.250
Going to the moon is not just
a scientific inevitability.

26:03.616 --> 26:05.684
It's a strategic necessity.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.515
Forget about Europe.

26:07.584 --> 26:09.458
Up there is the front of the future.

26:09.524 --> 26:12.193
And the first nation to plant
their flag on its surface

26:12.304 --> 26:15.021
will be the greatest superpower
the world has ever seen.

26:15.133 --> 26:17.501
Now, do you want that
flag to have a swastika,

26:17.529 --> 26:19.063
or the stars and stripes?

26:19.773 --> 26:21.315
Filip, are you gonna
put a stop to this?

26:21.404 --> 26:22.888
Professor Mesulam is
the one who helped us

26:22.913 --> 26:24.713
prove it was possible.

26:24.883 --> 26:27.352
These equations show that
my solid-fuel rockets

26:27.384 --> 26:30.721
can burn stable even as we
strive to reach escape velocity.

26:30.908 --> 26:32.058
Solid fuel?

26:32.116 --> 26:33.919
That's what I said.

26:36.398 --> 26:37.729
Time to go, sir.

26:38.575 --> 26:40.600
Are you leaving, or do I
need to call the police?

26:40.625 --> 26:43.198
No need. My work here is done.

26:43.354 --> 26:45.322
Remember, General, the
front of the future.

26:45.416 --> 26:47.918
My team is already fighting that war.

26:50.454 --> 26:52.308
I'm gonna enjoy this.

27:01.385 --> 27:02.879
Donovan, it's your wife.

27:02.934 --> 27:05.237
She's asking when
you'll be coming home.

27:07.576 --> 27:09.005
Tell her soon.

29:15.979 --> 29:17.981
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.795
You sure you're in the right place?

29:26.530 --> 29:28.129
All right.

29:52.443 --> 29:54.491
What'll you have, sir?

29:54.991 --> 29:56.999
Rye. Straight.

29:57.108 --> 29:58.842
You got it.

30:10.329 --> 30:11.542
Enjoy.

30:19.209 --> 30:22.145
So you're gonna be shy now
that I'm standing here?

30:25.569 --> 30:27.939
You know it's not polite to stare.

30:30.243 --> 30:32.462
I'm sorry, I-I thought
you were someone else.

30:33.846 --> 30:35.666
I'm sure you did.

30:35.854 --> 30:37.596
In here...

30:38.589 --> 30:40.133
everybody's looking for someone else.

30:43.139 --> 30:45.175
♪ Am I the guy

31:41.071 --> 31:42.584
Susan.

31:46.177 --> 31:48.094
Please open the door. I can explain.

31:52.008 --> 31:53.328
It's not what you think.

31:53.384 --> 31:55.153
I did this for us.

31:55.238 --> 31:56.873
To make it all happen.

32:18.368 --> 32:20.334
I'm sorry, Susan.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.977
I'm sorry.

32:33.105 --> 32:34.884
He thought she was getting a deal.

32:35.012 --> 32:37.715
Freedom, support, plus,
he did the cooking.

32:39.244 --> 32:40.719
So then what happened?

32:40.744 --> 32:44.113
The dreaded proclamation.
"I want to have kids."

32:44.429 --> 32:46.329
No avoiding the elephant
in the living room.

32:46.436 --> 32:48.699
Not that I'm one to say
I told you so, but...

32:48.879 --> 32:50.592
I told him so.

32:55.372 --> 32:56.751
What's going on?

32:57.282 --> 32:58.432
Act normal.

32:58.496 --> 33:00.022
Normal?

33:03.213 --> 33:05.227
Good evening, gents.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.769
It's awfully quiet in here.

33:09.101 --> 33:10.869
Everybody stay put.

33:10.894 --> 33:12.764
We've been getting some complaints.

33:13.263 --> 33:14.539
We're here just to make sure everything

33:14.563 --> 33:16.661
is on the straight and narrow.

33:19.830 --> 33:22.700
Wouldn't happen to be a friend
of Dorothy's, now would you?

33:22.826 --> 33:24.829
Hmm?

33:35.758 --> 33:37.624
Haven't seen you here before.

33:38.288 --> 33:40.278
You, on the other hand...

33:40.838 --> 33:42.272
You should steer clear.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.461
This one's a real pervert.

33:46.249 --> 33:48.620
You don't look like the guys
I normally catch in here.

33:49.606 --> 33:51.494
What kind of guy I look like?

33:52.016 --> 33:53.577
Only, if I saw you on the street,

33:53.602 --> 33:55.576
I'd never take you for a queer.

33:57.174 --> 33:59.109
Is that what I am?

33:59.436 --> 34:01.421
Well, you're here, aren't you?

34:01.558 --> 34:04.461
You must be looking to
get your pole smoked.

34:05.022 --> 34:06.995
Or are you the other kind...

34:08.170 --> 34:11.539
The kind who likes to do the smoking?

34:16.512 --> 34:17.578
Oh!

34:32.275 --> 34:33.425
Get up!

34:34.481 --> 34:35.793
Get up!

34:37.848 --> 34:40.330
Get up!

34:41.485 --> 34:42.753
Yeah!

34:47.341 --> 34:48.491
Yeah!

34:48.516 --> 34:50.538
Get off him! Beat the crap... Get up!

34:50.569 --> 34:52.817
- Hold that son of a bitch.
- You're dead!

34:52.951 --> 34:54.686
You're dead! Get up.

35:00.429 --> 35:01.831
Oh, my God.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.576
Get out of here! Get out of the way!

35:14.198 --> 35:15.603
Donovan, Ernest.

35:15.628 --> 35:18.072
Assaulting an officer,
public perversion,

35:18.162 --> 35:19.458
attempted sodomy.

35:19.503 --> 35:21.537
Turn to the right.

35:29.867 --> 35:31.513
Left thumb.

35:51.043 --> 35:53.045
All right, let's go.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.936
If I were married to a woman like you,

36:18.095 --> 36:20.931
no way you'd find me
in a place like that.

37:04.768 --> 37:06.349
I don't know why I...

37:06.451 --> 37:08.230
Shh, shh.

37:08.979 --> 37:11.715
You don't have to say anything.

37:50.621 --> 37:54.491
You remember that
little diner in Omaha?

37:55.873 --> 37:58.314
Right by the Orpheum.

38:01.172 --> 38:04.041
They did the best hash.

38:06.197 --> 38:09.968
I think they used...

38:35.713 --> 38:36.914
Professor?

38:36.973 --> 38:38.507
Come in, Richard.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.375
Your secretary said that
you needed to see me.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.665
Is everything all right?

38:46.035 --> 38:48.840
Your partner made unexpected
visit last night.

38:48.865 --> 38:50.974
Before you say anything,
I explicitly told him...

38:50.999 --> 38:54.035
I didn't ask you here to assign blame.

38:54.395 --> 38:56.543
God knows I played part, uh,

38:56.583 --> 38:58.152
by giving him these equations.

38:59.092 --> 39:00.220
Well,

39:00.245 --> 39:02.773
maybe it's best I'm
leaving the project.

39:03.270 --> 39:05.539
We work better as friends
than colleagues.

39:06.254 --> 39:09.122
You will have to learn to be both.

39:10.494 --> 39:12.929
Mr. Parsons broke many rules.

39:13.734 --> 39:15.369
But in so doing,

39:15.423 --> 39:18.524
he managed to spark the
general's interest.

39:19.018 --> 39:20.423
What, in going to the moon?

39:20.458 --> 39:23.893
The general is not interested
in "front of the future."

39:24.463 --> 39:26.063
The military cares about

39:26.088 --> 39:28.224
what they can use now.

39:31.645 --> 39:33.823
General Braxton believes, uh,

39:33.848 --> 39:36.146
there may be a military application

39:36.171 --> 39:39.075
for these solid-fuel rockets.

39:40.510 --> 39:42.445
We're being considered for funding?

39:42.480 --> 39:43.947
Yes.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.851
What about the propeller team?

39:47.885 --> 39:50.588
The rocketry project
now takes priority.

39:50.695 --> 39:53.303
The general has requested
a presentation

39:53.328 --> 39:57.098
be given before his
committee at Army Air Corps

39:57.123 --> 39:58.661
in Washington, D.C.

39:58.922 --> 40:02.893
He suggested you be the one to make it.

40:04.538 --> 40:06.170
Uh, no.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.505
No, no, sir, I-I couldn't.

40:08.659 --> 40:10.608
Jack's the one that-that
should present this.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.041
Yes, I know.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.653
Mr. Parsons refusing

40:14.678 --> 40:17.881
to give up his dream is
what made this possible.

40:19.896 --> 40:22.036
But with war coming...

40:22.987 --> 40:25.590
there's no time for such things.

41:21.270 --> 41:22.572
Maggie?

41:23.179 --> 41:24.547
Don't worry,

41:24.677 --> 41:26.510
this had nothing to do with you.

41:26.729 --> 41:29.798
It's a relief, to be honest.

41:30.153 --> 41:32.155
At least now I know the truth.

41:33.409 --> 41:35.075
I never stood a chance.

41:35.359 --> 41:36.666
Against them?

41:37.679 --> 41:39.597
No, no, that's...

41:39.936 --> 41:42.371
that's not what I meant.

41:44.251 --> 41:47.365
Listen, he's not in so deep

41:47.390 --> 41:49.392
that he can't be pulled back out.

41:53.884 --> 41:56.152
Take care of yourself.

42:31.869 --> 42:33.303
Susan?

42:36.451 --> 42:37.634
No, Jack.

42:39.499 --> 42:40.722
I came here to talk,

42:40.747 --> 42:42.736
and Susie told me that
you'd be out here.

42:43.941 --> 42:45.295
What's going on with you two?

42:48.089 --> 42:49.598
Nothing.

42:51.231 --> 42:53.369
Just the usual marital woes.

42:54.755 --> 42:57.187
You don't have a wife.
You wouldn't understand.

42:58.661 --> 43:00.417
No, I suppose I wouldn't.

43:00.530 --> 43:02.399
What did you want to talk to me about?

43:03.506 --> 43:06.791
Well, Mesulam told me that
you made quite a show

43:06.816 --> 43:08.223
at the Athenaeum.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.409
Jesus, Richard, if you're
just here to scold me...

43:10.434 --> 43:11.961
No, I'm not.

43:12.434 --> 43:15.373
Believe it or not,
Braxton wants to hear

43:15.398 --> 43:18.405
a full proposal on solid-fuel
rockets in Washington.

43:18.568 --> 43:20.135
You mean it worked?

43:21.420 --> 43:22.625
It worked?

43:22.650 --> 43:24.381
This time, but I wouldn't make a habit

43:24.406 --> 43:26.452
of gate-crashing the Athenaeum.

43:26.566 --> 43:28.771
That's not what I mean.

43:30.092 --> 43:31.762
I did this.

43:33.309 --> 43:35.391
I willed this into existence.

43:35.464 --> 43:37.067
What are you talking about?

43:37.891 --> 43:39.531
It doesn't matter.

43:40.310 --> 43:42.812
All that matters is that
we're gonna go to D.C.

43:46.782 --> 43:48.257
Yeah.
