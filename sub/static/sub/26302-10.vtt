WEBVTT

00:00.838 --> 00:02.830
Previously on Empire...

00:02.831 --> 00:04.898
I don't know what's worse...
the data mining

00:04.899 --> 00:06.477
or selling customer info
to the government.

00:06.501 --> 00:07.501
I had nothing to do with this.

00:07.502 --> 00:09.002
This is entirely Lucious Lyon.

00:09.003 --> 00:11.204
Cookie, I was wondering
if I could stay here.

00:11.206 --> 00:12.673
You can stay.

00:12.674 --> 00:14.185
So you're asking me to choose
between what's right

00:14.209 --> 00:15.842
and what's right for your family?

00:15.844 --> 00:18.145
I think I need time
to think about our story.

00:18.146 --> 00:20.090
I have something to tell you
about Jeff Kingsley.

00:20.114 --> 00:22.426
What if I told you I could
have him out of Empire for good

00:22.450 --> 00:24.651
and get you back
running the company you built,

00:24.652 --> 00:25.886
with me as co-partner?

00:25.887 --> 00:29.156
Lucious Lyon is my father.

00:29.157 --> 00:31.502
You better tell me this is not true.

00:31.526 --> 00:33.927
So, what, you gonna leave...

00:41.302 --> 00:43.604
Baby... baby.

00:43.605 --> 00:47.074
We need this room, please.

00:47.075 --> 00:48.609
Hello! We need this room!

00:48.610 --> 00:51.111
Get the hell out!

00:51.112 --> 00:53.714
Look, baby. Baby, baby,
I didn't know...

00:53.715 --> 00:55.426
What? Where to find
the rubbers back in the day?

00:55.450 --> 00:56.560
No, I didn't know he was...

00:56.584 --> 00:59.453
Your son? Your own
flesh and blood? Really?

00:59.454 --> 01:01.421
I mean, it's not like
I took a paternity test

01:01.422 --> 01:02.756
or knew for certain or s...

01:02.757 --> 01:03.957
But you knew.

01:03.958 --> 01:06.827
How?

01:06.828 --> 01:09.396
I went to see her.

01:10.565 --> 01:14.044
His mother, and I remembered
her, baby, I re...

01:14.068 --> 01:16.536
- We were young and...
- Screwing like rabbits.

01:16.538 --> 01:17.566
No, we were... I was...

01:17.590 --> 01:19.917
How much more trouble is
this man meat of yours

01:19.941 --> 01:23.210
- gonna cause me?
- Baby, I was s... 16 years old.

01:23.211 --> 01:24.978
I was young and dumb and...

01:24.979 --> 01:26.613
Don't you say it.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.017
Okay.

01:31.486 --> 01:32.953
We have bigger problems

01:32.954 --> 01:36.623
than some damn paternity test, okay?

01:36.624 --> 01:39.693
If we let Jeff Kingsley

01:39.694 --> 01:41.528
run around telling people

01:41.529 --> 01:43.930
that you stole information
from people's phones,

01:43.932 --> 01:45.932
he could destroy
everything we've built.

01:45.934 --> 01:48.335
- I know.
- Shut your ass up!

01:51.773 --> 01:53.874
We got to take him down.

01:56.778 --> 02:00.247
And I don't care
if he's your damn son.

02:01.749 --> 02:04.685
I need to know
you're with me, Lucious.

02:06.287 --> 02:08.422
Of course I am.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.577 --> 02:31.382
All right, boys.

02:31.383 --> 02:34.551
It's time for us
to have a grown-up talk.

02:34.552 --> 02:36.954
Giselle told us she
thinks that she can convince

02:36.955 --> 02:40.390
Kelly Patel to sell us part of Empire.

02:40.392 --> 02:41.925
If we can pull enough together.

02:41.926 --> 02:44.595
Patel is rather upset about

02:44.596 --> 02:47.064
his share prices tanking

02:47.065 --> 02:49.867
as a result of the bad press
right now.

02:49.868 --> 02:53.537
So he wants to reduce his risk
by cutting his stake in Empire?

02:53.538 --> 02:54.749
That's an opportunity for us.

02:54.773 --> 02:56.039
- Exact...
- Exactly.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.842
That's why Giselle was able
to convince him

02:58.843 --> 03:01.879
that whole data mining thing
was about Kingsley

03:01.880 --> 03:04.848
and not about me. Now,
if I can prove my innocence,

03:04.849 --> 03:07.584
then Giselle is willing to go

03:07.585 --> 03:09.786
and be a third partner
with me and your mother.

03:09.788 --> 03:11.465
She inherited all those
shares from Eddie.

03:11.489 --> 03:13.350
Yeah, well,
you know, a good gold digger

03:13.351 --> 03:14.918
always keeps a few coins in her bra.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.553
Here we go again, just going back

03:16.555 --> 03:18.181
to something that just
brings out the worst in us.

03:18.205 --> 03:20.424
No, no, we're not going backwards.

03:20.425 --> 03:23.861
We are taking what's ours
and we're moving forward.

03:23.862 --> 03:25.173
Empire is built on Lyon blood,

03:25.197 --> 03:27.064
sweat and tears. It belongs to us.

03:27.065 --> 03:29.466
- That's right.
- Thank you, Andre.

03:29.467 --> 03:31.835
Maybe you can help me find out

03:31.836 --> 03:33.814
how Kingsley was able
to pin that data mining on me.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.306
I got you, Pop.

03:35.307 --> 03:37.841
- And Jamal.
- Yeah?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.320
Look, man, I'm gonna need you
to talk to Kai

03:39.344 --> 03:42.880
and ask him to get some
of the people he interviewed

03:42.881 --> 03:45.282
to help me and your mother in this.

03:45.283 --> 03:46.561
Yo, if you're gonna
backslide into a place

03:46.585 --> 03:48.152
that destroyed our family,

03:48.153 --> 03:49.987
I think y'all need
to do that yourself.

03:49.988 --> 03:52.089
Boy, did you forget
your last name is Lyon?

03:52.090 --> 03:55.259
The Lyons are Empire. You are Empire.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.528
So no matter what you think

03:57.529 --> 04:00.464
or how you feel about it,
or how I feel about it,

04:00.465 --> 04:02.633
if it's tainted, we're all tainted.

04:04.569 --> 04:05.969
I'll see what I can do.

04:05.971 --> 04:07.471
Thank you.

04:07.472 --> 04:08.482
What about me?

04:08.506 --> 04:10.441
We need you to get in the studio

04:10.442 --> 04:13.544
and knock out some raw bangers,

04:13.545 --> 04:16.947
so that when we take back Empire,

04:16.947 --> 04:19.550
we'll be able to prove
that we still got it.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.485
- I got you.
- All right.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.023
Thank you, guys.

04:31.263 --> 04:34.064
So, we not just gonna ignore
that little long-lost DeBarge

04:34.065 --> 04:36.300
- says he's our brother?
- No.

04:36.301 --> 04:37.445
- I'm sorry.
- We should beat his ass.

04:37.469 --> 04:38.779
We ain't gonna beat nobody's ass.

04:38.803 --> 04:40.404
I'm worried about Mom.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.473
She up in here acting
like everything is okay.

04:42.474 --> 04:44.241
Just... No point in that, man.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.976
You know she'd rather fight than feel.

04:49.314 --> 04:52.149
Look, I'm not letting some
white boy shouting "poor me"

04:52.150 --> 04:53.550
stake a claim to my birthright.

04:53.551 --> 04:55.219
Now, if he's telling the truth,

04:55.220 --> 04:58.021
I say we treat him like family.

04:58.023 --> 05:00.858
Tear his ass down.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.006
And then I fly out to
London at the end of the week.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.764
Kai, what are we doing?

05:06.765 --> 05:09.266
I mean, you love me, I love you.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.145
There's none of this stuff
we can't figure out.

05:11.169 --> 05:13.404
- Mal, I need time.
- You've had time.

05:13.405 --> 05:15.072
Two days?

05:15.073 --> 05:17.193
Whatever, take your CP time,
then, with your slow ass.

05:18.176 --> 05:19.777
Well...

05:19.778 --> 05:22.379
Let me have this.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.848
- How's Becky?
- She's scared.

05:24.849 --> 05:27.418
Kingsley damn near had her arrested.

05:27.419 --> 05:29.363
You know, the whole thing
could kind of ruin her.

05:29.387 --> 05:32.823
That's why I was-I was thinking, um...

05:34.693 --> 05:37.428
Trust me, I feel stupid
even bringing this up.

05:37.429 --> 05:39.863
But would you consider, um,

05:39.864 --> 05:41.932
talking to my dad about your sources?

05:41.933 --> 05:43.145
He's just trying to
figure some stuff...

05:43.169 --> 05:43.957
Wow. Okay, Jamal.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.379
- Is this why we're here?
- I'm sorry. No.

05:45.403 --> 05:48.272
- To do this for your daddy?
- Again?

05:48.273 --> 05:50.240
I'll text you when I get back.

05:50.241 --> 05:51.842
Why don't you take this time and see

05:51.843 --> 05:53.377
if you want to be my husband

05:53.378 --> 05:57.114
- or Cookie and Lucious' son.
- I can be both.

05:57.115 --> 05:59.126
- Can you?
- You know what, Kai? Don't help my dad.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.586
You know, kind of like
I told you already.

06:02.587 --> 06:04.388
But Becky, she didn't do anything.

06:04.389 --> 06:06.500
And the fact of the matter is,
is that this is your story,

06:06.524 --> 06:08.025
so you could fix it.

06:09.961 --> 06:11.829
Take care.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.175
So are you gonna let me talk now,

06:25.176 --> 06:27.811
or are you gonna
keep telling me to shut up?

06:27.812 --> 06:30.314
I told you, we have bigger
problems than your little...

06:30.315 --> 06:32.683
Look, I know, but how
are you gonna blame me

06:32.684 --> 06:35.052
and hold me responsible
for something that I did

06:35.053 --> 06:37.054
before I even met you, baby?

06:37.055 --> 06:40.357
Please, man, I t...

06:40.358 --> 06:42.259
Please tell me you have good news.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.527
I wish I did.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.896
It looks like the victims
of Empire's data mining

06:45.897 --> 06:47.598
are about to file
a $100 million lawsuit

06:47.599 --> 06:50.767
- against you and Becky.
- What?!

06:50.769 --> 06:52.413
- For what?!
- For the whole data mining scheme.

06:52.437 --> 06:53.937
$100 million lawsuit.

06:53.938 --> 06:56.106
Man, that'll take LFM.

06:56.107 --> 06:58.976
The house.
It would... it will ruin us.

07:02.225 --> 07:03.907
Here's what Kingsley's
got on you, Pop.

07:03.908 --> 07:05.708
E-mails between you and Becky
telling her

07:05.709 --> 07:07.610
to change the terms of service

07:07.611 --> 07:09.612
and to begin stealing
Empire's user data.

07:09.613 --> 07:12.448
Wait, well, how did he get
my e-mails in the first place?

07:12.449 --> 07:13.916
Did you fill anything out?

07:13.918 --> 07:15.195
You know, give anybody
your password or...

07:15.219 --> 07:17.987
Hell no, I'd never
do something like that.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.591
Okay. Look, we'll figure it out,
Pop. Okay?

07:21.592 --> 07:23.403
If we can prove that
you didn't send these e-mails,

07:23.427 --> 07:25.128
we'll be in the clear.

07:25.129 --> 07:26.129
Okay, well, whatever you're gonna do,

07:26.130 --> 07:27.363
you got to do it quickly.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.432
After the lawsuit files on Friday,

07:29.433 --> 07:31.434
we're not gonna be able
to stop this train.

07:31.435 --> 07:32.546
And then, I got to go,
calm Becky down,

07:32.570 --> 07:33.647
'cause she's freaking out.

07:33.671 --> 07:36.072
Yeah, just let her know
that we got her, man.

07:36.073 --> 07:38.741
- Okay.
- Listen, Andre, um,

07:38.742 --> 07:41.911
I know we got things
we need to talk about.

07:41.912 --> 07:43.880
What, Kingsley's little pity party?

07:43.881 --> 07:46.115
I know who my father is,

07:46.116 --> 07:47.283
and I know who he's not.

07:47.284 --> 07:49.319
We're good, Pop.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.421
There you are.

07:51.422 --> 07:53.423
Future son-in-law.

07:53.424 --> 07:55.425
Tell me you've got something for us.

07:55.426 --> 07:57.193
Um, I-I don't know
if it'll help or not,

07:57.194 --> 07:59.929
but, it's a source maybe
y'all should look at?

07:59.930 --> 08:01.864
Come on. Come here.

08:03.601 --> 08:05.145
Now, this guy
used to be irrelevant.

08:05.169 --> 08:08.638
Then somehow, magically,
he found your e-mails,

08:08.639 --> 08:10.006
leaked the whole thing.

08:10.007 --> 08:11.307
Now he's WikiLeaks 2.0

08:11.308 --> 08:13.242
and he's got millions of followers.

08:13.244 --> 08:16.412
And you think that this guy
is working for Kingsley?

08:16.413 --> 08:19.082
Let's ask him.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.851
Excuse me.

08:54.852 --> 08:57.053
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

08:57.054 --> 08:58.431
Couldn't you be in the middle
of some headphones?

08:58.455 --> 08:59.822
We're trying to sleep.

08:59.823 --> 09:01.958
I'm sorry. Does the superstar
need her beauty rest?

09:01.959 --> 09:05.862
It don't take that much
for me to look this sexy.

09:07.097 --> 09:08.775
- Why are you even up?
- Because I'm trying

09:08.799 --> 09:11.000
- to get back to ballet.
- Aren't you over

09:11.001 --> 09:12.379
trying to be black ballerina Barbie?

09:12.403 --> 09:13.970
Aren't you over trying to make

09:13.971 --> 09:15.371
the sixth remix to "Drip Drop"?

09:15.372 --> 09:16.850
You know, for your sake,

09:16.874 --> 09:18.718
I really hope that your fans
never gain taste.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.543
You might want to try something new

09:20.544 --> 09:22.925
or step outside of your box
before you tell me what to do.

09:23.547 --> 09:25.448
Excuse me.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.602
- Here she comes!
- Cookie!

09:35.626 --> 09:37.570
- Cookie!
- Cookie, is Jeff Kingsley a "break baby"

09:37.594 --> 09:39.028
or did Lucious cheat on you?

09:39.029 --> 09:40.674
Cookie, what would you
tell women all over the world

09:40.698 --> 09:42.142
who have been lied to by their men?

09:42.166 --> 09:43.910
Black Twitter's calling you
"Chickenhead of the Decade."

09:43.934 --> 09:45.445
- Any comment?
- Bet you won't say that to her face, ho!

09:45.469 --> 09:47.503
Mrs. Lyon has no comment.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.982
Just one comment!

09:49.006 --> 09:50.273
- Cookie!
- One comment!

09:59.049 --> 10:01.050
Becky, we can't just
sit here sad all day.

10:01.051 --> 10:02.985
No, yes, we can.

10:02.986 --> 10:04.464
'Cause we are going through it, okay?

10:04.488 --> 10:06.389
I'm gonna have to work
at a beauty supply

10:06.390 --> 10:08.124
when this lawsuit is done with me.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.536
Do you understand what that means?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.461
I ain't going back to synthetic hair.

10:11.462 --> 10:13.073
I've been living
the Remy life too long,

10:13.097 --> 10:14.941
and do you even know how
expensive it is to go natural?

10:14.965 --> 10:15.965
Calm your ass down.

10:15.966 --> 10:17.700
You got to think about my edges, Mal.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.877
You know what's gonna
make you feel better?

10:18.901 --> 10:21.204
- Nothing.
- Music.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.940
Look. I just made this.

10:31.181 --> 10:32.849
You're so dumb.

10:32.850 --> 10:35.651
But, see, you can't feel sad
listening to the beat.

10:35.652 --> 10:37.386
You actually might be right.

10:37.388 --> 10:39.455
This is really dope.

10:39.456 --> 10:41.123
When you putting this out as a single?

10:41.125 --> 10:42.402
It's not for me. It's for Devon.

10:42.426 --> 10:43.659
He's gonna kill it.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.028
Devon? Are you serious?

10:46.029 --> 10:47.797
This needs to be a Jamal solo.

10:49.266 --> 10:51.133
Besides, Kai says it's reductive.

10:51.135 --> 10:53.069
Kai says it...

10:53.070 --> 10:54.614
I didn't realize
that Kai was doing A&R

10:54.638 --> 10:55.682
down in Afghanistan?

10:55.706 --> 10:58.007
You need to stop letting your man

10:58.008 --> 11:00.843
come between you and your music.
You're losing yourself.

11:00.844 --> 11:02.178
That's an urban legend.

11:02.179 --> 11:03.412
- Is it?
- Okay?

11:05.516 --> 11:07.583
Whatever.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.219
I guess you can be sad
listening to this.

11:10.220 --> 11:11.654
Well, no, no, no.

11:11.655 --> 11:14.090
Hold on. Let's not give up so easily.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.558
All right,

11:15.559 --> 11:16.993
I'm gonna take you someplace

11:16.994 --> 11:18.928
that's gonna cheer you up. Come on.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.796
- Where we going?
- Where we going?

11:20.798 --> 11:24.867
I said I'm-a take you someplace
to cheer you up.

11:24.868 --> 11:26.536
Like I said, I have no idea

11:26.537 --> 11:27.847
- what you're talking about.
- Look, we know you know,

11:27.871 --> 11:29.472
Mr. Moross. All right, now,

11:29.473 --> 11:30.784
you can talk to us, or you can talk

11:30.808 --> 11:32.308
to the FBI. Your choice.

11:32.309 --> 11:33.910
Anyone but you three.

11:33.911 --> 11:37.346
Goodbye. Don't let the doorknob
hit you on the way out.

11:37.347 --> 11:38.848
Look, I'm sorry.

11:38.849 --> 11:40.316
I don't know what else we can do.

11:41.218 --> 11:42.752
It's all right, Kai.

11:42.753 --> 11:44.587
We tried it your way.

11:45.556 --> 11:47.723
I'm sorry, man.

11:47.724 --> 11:49.725
I'm burning up.
I'm about to die from this heat.

11:49.726 --> 11:51.627
Scorching.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.863
Now, are you sure

11:53.864 --> 11:57.767
you don't want to answer
this gentleman's nice questions?

11:57.768 --> 12:00.570
Are you deaf and dumb? Please leave.

12:00.571 --> 12:02.004
Apparently, I'm both.

12:03.373 --> 12:05.207
We got this.

12:05.209 --> 12:06.776
Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:06.777 --> 12:09.345
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Please!

12:09.346 --> 12:11.747
- Dre, Dre, Dre, Dre!
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:11.748 --> 12:13.393
- We tried it your way.
- Please! No!

12:13.417 --> 12:16.319
I-I... I-I don't know anything!

12:16.320 --> 12:18.321
Yeah, talk!
Or the next time you go viral

12:18.322 --> 12:19.933
- is gonna be at your funeral.
- What are you doing?

12:19.957 --> 12:21.067
- Stop! Pull him up!
- Come on.

12:21.091 --> 12:22.458
Hey, hey. Give him a minute.

12:22.459 --> 12:25.161
- I-I don't know anything!
- I think I'm losing my grip, Pop.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.182
Okay, I'll talk,
I'll talk, I'll talk, I'll talk!

12:27.764 --> 12:30.666
Who do you work for?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.835
Kingsley gave me
these documents to leak.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.013
Th-They made me relevant again.

12:34.037 --> 12:36.205
He faked all the e-mails,
I put them out.

12:36.206 --> 12:37.373
Yeah, well, we need proof.

12:37.374 --> 12:38.618
Documents, e-mails, what do you got?

12:38.642 --> 12:39.652
Um...

12:46.350 --> 12:48.351
Check your source.

12:48.352 --> 12:51.320
You don't want to be getting
out some fake news.

12:51.321 --> 12:53.422
Come on.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.532
Welcome to the family, son.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.968
That was a blast.

13:09.846 --> 13:12.014
Well, let me know
what the next step is.

13:12.015 --> 13:14.383
Okay. Let me know how it goes. Bye.

13:14.384 --> 13:16.619
Ms. Cookie?

13:16.620 --> 13:18.460
- Someone's here for you.
- Thank you, Juanita.

13:19.823 --> 13:21.701
Hell, no. The last time
you was here, you told me

13:21.725 --> 13:23.402
I wasn't your sister,
so get the hell out my house!

13:23.426 --> 13:25.404
- We both said a lot of things.
- You tried to ruin

13:25.428 --> 13:27.073
- my marriage.
- You could've killed my son.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.608
- Look, you know that's not why...
- Look here, look here.

13:28.632 --> 13:30.199
Stop it. Stop!

13:33.670 --> 13:36.071
Look, I don't know if we're good yet.

13:37.807 --> 13:41.043
But you're my sister,
and you're hurting.

13:41.044 --> 13:43.145
So I'm here.

13:46.416 --> 13:48.851
I'm sorry.

13:54.157 --> 13:56.225
I'm sorry.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.295
Old stank-ass.

14:01.765 --> 14:04.299
Students. Settle down.

14:04.301 --> 14:06.935
We have a special performance
about to begin.

14:07.871 --> 14:09.004
Y'all all right?

14:14.578 --> 14:16.245
Let's go!

15:31.655 --> 15:33.655
Yeah, man.

15:33.657 --> 15:37.092
Yo, yo, yo. I'm so happy to be here.

15:37.093 --> 15:38.660
Thank you so much.

15:38.662 --> 15:40.406
I don't know
if y'all been reading the blogs

15:40.430 --> 15:41.830
and all that foolishness,

15:41.831 --> 15:43.832
but it's kind of been a tough week,

15:43.833 --> 15:47.569
so I had to come home
to my own high school!

15:47.570 --> 15:48.614
I love you!

15:48.638 --> 15:50.639
What, what, what!

15:50.640 --> 15:52.841
I love y'all so much.

15:52.842 --> 15:54.710
Stick together, yeah?

16:05.155 --> 16:07.489
What's that? More stolen user data?

16:07.490 --> 16:10.592
No, we found your leaker.

16:10.593 --> 16:13.662
Now, I've got to be honest with you.

16:13.663 --> 16:16.598
I don't know the first thing
about programming nothing.

16:16.599 --> 16:20.169
I couldn't figure out
what it was that you did.

16:20.170 --> 16:23.472
But my really smart son Andre did.

16:23.473 --> 16:25.874
Now, he says the app that gave

16:25.875 --> 16:29.411
all those millions of followers
to that journalist...

16:29.412 --> 16:31.513
the same journalist who released

16:31.514 --> 16:34.583
all those fake e-mails
supposedly from me...

16:34.584 --> 16:37.452
it had your digital DNA all over it.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.421
Doesn't prove anything.

16:39.422 --> 16:41.824
It proves you were covering.

16:41.825 --> 16:45.460
Why would you cover unless
you had something to hide?

16:45.462 --> 16:48.597
So now you've got one of two choices.

16:48.598 --> 16:50.799
Now, you can sign this press release,

16:50.800 --> 16:54.703
accepting full responsibility
for everything you did

16:54.704 --> 16:57.739
and clearing Becky and my name.

16:57.741 --> 17:00.576
Or you can get you a switch

17:00.577 --> 17:04.046
and you and me can go outside,
and I can give you

17:04.047 --> 17:06.515
a public ass-whuping that you deserve.

17:06.516 --> 17:09.585
I'm giving you a choice

17:09.586 --> 17:11.587
because you are my son.

17:32.041 --> 17:35.277
I took the thing that you value most,

17:35.278 --> 17:39.047
I toyed with it for my own
personal entertainment,

17:39.048 --> 17:42.150
and I still made it better
than you ever could.

17:44.053 --> 17:46.355
I guess that makes me
better than any Lyon.

18:07.443 --> 18:10.379
All right, so,
are you sure you good, Cook?

18:10.380 --> 18:13.882
So Lucious chopped down
some simple white bitch.

18:13.883 --> 18:15.751
It is what it is.

18:15.752 --> 18:18.820
You know, she was probably
just the neighborhood bicycle.

18:18.822 --> 18:22.324
All the little boys had a ride.

18:22.325 --> 18:24.960
I mean, I don't know
if it's like all that.

18:24.961 --> 18:26.261
I mean, I knew her.

18:26.262 --> 18:27.629
- You did?!
- You did?!

18:27.630 --> 18:30.098
Well, I-I...
Yeah, I knew her from the block.

18:30.099 --> 18:31.310
We used to get high together.

18:31.334 --> 18:33.135
Name was Tracy.

18:33.136 --> 18:36.071
We used to call her White Tracy
so Black Tracy wouldn't get mad.

18:36.072 --> 18:37.550
These little white girls
with fast asses.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.608
They get caught up,
and then, you know...

18:39.609 --> 18:41.320
There were these little rumors
about her, though,

18:41.344 --> 18:43.512
that she had some kid.
That's why she disappeared.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.514
Well, did you know it was Lucious'?

18:45.515 --> 18:48.283
Cookie, are you kidding me?
No, I would've told you.

18:48.284 --> 18:49.918
Well, damn.

18:49.919 --> 18:51.653
What else I didn't know?

18:51.654 --> 18:53.722
You knew her. Lucious knew her.

18:53.723 --> 18:55.657
And now that damn son

18:55.658 --> 18:59.161
is running around
trying to ruin our lives.

18:59.162 --> 19:02.497
I told myself this story
about our lives that...

19:02.498 --> 19:04.700
I believed was true.

19:04.701 --> 19:07.402
But I don't know what that is anymore.

19:07.403 --> 19:10.339
Look, I never said anything
about my son

19:10.340 --> 19:14.343
because I told myself a story
about how everything was fine.

19:14.344 --> 19:16.945
Now Franklin's in the hospital,

19:16.946 --> 19:18.357
and a whole lot of people got hurt

19:18.381 --> 19:20.582
when that lie blew up in my face.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.250
Don't run from the truth, Cookie.

19:22.252 --> 19:24.519
Go find it.

19:35.598 --> 19:39.234
Hi. I'm Cookie Lyon.

19:40.169 --> 19:42.971
I know who you are.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.920
You don't remember me, do you?

19:51.921 --> 19:54.022
Um...

19:55.525 --> 19:56.925
no, I can't say that I do.

19:56.926 --> 19:58.493
I remember you.

19:58.494 --> 20:00.429
I remember you very well.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.665
Strutting around on the corner
in your big hoops.

20:05.068 --> 20:07.469
What happened? If-if you don't mind.

20:07.470 --> 20:09.171
Crack.

20:09.172 --> 20:12.007
I was a junkie.

20:12.008 --> 20:14.109
And then I had a stroke.

20:14.110 --> 20:16.278
And another stroke.

20:16.279 --> 20:18.413
Now I'm here.

20:18.414 --> 20:20.382
- I'm sorry.
- I don't need your pity, Cookie.

20:20.383 --> 20:21.950
It's not pity.

20:21.951 --> 20:24.619
I had a heart attack,
so I know what it's like

20:24.620 --> 20:27.489
when your body turns on you.
So I'm truly sorry.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.257
Yeah, you seem real sorry.

20:29.258 --> 20:31.626
So you think this is a...

20:31.627 --> 20:33.495
a walk in the park for me?

20:33.496 --> 20:35.497
The world is talking about me

20:35.498 --> 20:38.633
like I'm a gap-toothed,
three-legged dog.

20:38.634 --> 20:41.069
I don't even know what happened.

20:41.070 --> 20:44.673
I know Lucious has a story.
You have one.

20:45.575 --> 20:49.211
I'd like to know it... please.

20:50.113 --> 20:53.315
When Cookie met Lucious...

20:56.586 --> 20:59.955
When Cookie met Lucious,
I was already pregnant

20:59.956 --> 21:02.057
with Lucious' baby.

21:03.526 --> 21:06.294
Thank you. I won't...

21:06.295 --> 21:08.497
I won't take up any more of your time.

21:08.498 --> 21:10.499
You're done?

21:10.500 --> 21:12.701
You don't care?

21:12.702 --> 21:15.137
I couldn't raise that kid.

21:15.138 --> 21:17.606
I couldn't be a daughter.

21:17.607 --> 21:20.041
I couldn't be a mom.

21:20.043 --> 21:22.043
All because of what
you people took from me.

21:22.045 --> 21:23.945
You people?

21:23.946 --> 21:26.581
I didn't put that crack pipe
in your hand, sweetheart.

21:26.582 --> 21:28.316
That was a choice.

21:28.317 --> 21:30.285
Yeah, but you always
had the good stuff.

21:30.286 --> 21:32.921
You just k-kept me
coming back for more.

21:35.591 --> 21:37.726
I lost everything.

21:38.661 --> 21:41.997
I lost everything.

21:41.998 --> 21:43.865
I lost my husband.

21:43.866 --> 21:46.535
I couldn't raise my three sons.

21:46.536 --> 21:48.737
I spent 17 years behind bars

21:48.738 --> 21:51.673
while your little white ass was free.

21:53.042 --> 21:55.544
So we both lost.

21:56.746 --> 21:58.747
I guess the day.

21:58.748 --> 22:02.017
Cookie met Lucious
wasn't so pretty after all.

22:15.965 --> 22:17.709
All right, so let's
just stick to the script

22:17.733 --> 22:19.545
and not say much more,
especially if we're asked

22:19.569 --> 22:21.303
about our brother from another mother.

22:21.304 --> 22:23.171
Speak of the devil.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.409
What would Lucious and Cookie say?

22:27.410 --> 22:30.345
"The most valuable asset
to Empire is family."

22:30.346 --> 22:32.981
- And here we all are.
- You're not family.

22:32.982 --> 22:36.651
I won't claim to be family just
because we share the same blood.

22:36.652 --> 22:39.254
If I were a real Lyon,
would I walk away?

22:40.223 --> 22:42.524
Would I accept defeat?

22:42.525 --> 22:44.359
Would I curl up and die?

22:44.360 --> 22:46.494
But you're not.

22:46.496 --> 22:47.606
So you should walk away quietly.

22:47.630 --> 22:49.464
While you still can.

22:50.666 --> 22:53.134
Nature versus nurture.

22:53.136 --> 22:55.237
Let's see which one wins.

22:57.306 --> 22:59.107
That sounded like a threat.

22:59.108 --> 23:01.209
Most definitely.

23:08.985 --> 23:12.654
Just like they did in a small
garage in North Philadelphia,

23:12.655 --> 23:15.023
Lucious and Cookie Lyon
built a stunning roster

23:15.024 --> 23:16.958
of exceptional talent

23:16.959 --> 23:19.761
under the Lyon Family
Management banner.

23:19.762 --> 23:21.263
Now, you combine that

23:21.264 --> 23:23.732
with the technological talents
of Kelly Patel,

23:23.733 --> 23:26.534
and you're about to watch Empire
soar to new heights

23:26.536 --> 23:28.470
in a new age.

23:28.471 --> 23:30.538
So help me welcome

23:30.540 --> 23:34.676
the heart and the soul of Empire,

23:34.677 --> 23:37.212
and, yes, the face of the company...

23:37.213 --> 23:39.648
Lucious Lyon!

23:44.654 --> 23:47.255
I cannot tell you
what a thrill it is to be here,

23:47.256 --> 23:51.092
in the same place where,
just only a little while ago...

23:51.093 --> 23:54.329
I had to announce
that we were broke...

23:54.330 --> 23:56.364
but we weren't broken.

23:56.365 --> 23:59.401
You see, thanks to the support
of my incredible wife

23:59.402 --> 24:03.171
and my lovely family,
we managed to rise,

24:03.172 --> 24:04.773
'cause that's what we do.

24:04.774 --> 24:07.409
Now the Empire is bigger

24:07.410 --> 24:09.711
and stronger than ever.

24:09.712 --> 24:12.747
So this is to the Empire!

24:12.748 --> 24:13.882
To the Empire!

24:13.883 --> 24:14.883
To the Empire!

24:14.884 --> 24:16.785
To the Empire!

24:16.786 --> 24:18.453
To the Empire!

24:18.454 --> 24:20.388
- Please.
- What have you been using?

24:20.389 --> 24:21.790
To the Empire!

24:22.458 --> 24:23.925
Get down!

24:23.926 --> 24:26.094
To the Empire!

24:27.863 --> 24:29.331
To the Empire!

24:29.332 --> 24:30.342
To the Empire...!

24:30.366 --> 24:32.400
To the Empire!

24:32.401 --> 24:34.035
Excuse me.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.471
Um, how many times have we stood

24:36.472 --> 24:38.740
in front of you
and put our fists in the air

24:38.741 --> 24:40.775
and chanted, "To the Empire"?

24:40.776 --> 24:42.744
Well, it's been you...

24:42.745 --> 24:45.747
the people, the fans, our family...

24:45.748 --> 24:48.717
that has come to our aid

24:48.718 --> 24:50.752
when we needed it most.

24:50.753 --> 24:52.253
And I think it's time that

24:52.255 --> 24:54.389
we give back...

24:54.390 --> 24:56.958
just as much as we take,

24:56.959 --> 24:59.527
because you all are the Empire.

24:59.528 --> 25:02.797
So I'm gonna ask
that everyone hold hands

25:02.798 --> 25:04.566
right now, just link up.

25:04.567 --> 25:07.535
Look, I know y'all,
y'all not too sexy and...

25:07.536 --> 25:09.037
and gangsta to do that, are you?

25:09.038 --> 25:13.341
Everyone up here is in service to you.

25:13.342 --> 25:15.543
To inspire you.

25:15.544 --> 25:17.679
To lift you up.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.247
To heal.

25:19.248 --> 25:21.716
And to party...!

25:21.717 --> 25:23.952
'Cause that's what we about to do.

25:23.953 --> 25:26.821
So we're inviting
each and every one of you

25:26.822 --> 25:28.957
to the Lyons Are Back Bash.

25:28.958 --> 25:32.861
Hug somebody, because our family
has been reunited!

25:35.531 --> 25:37.298
Congrats, Dad.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.802
- You got it back.
- No. Congrats to Kai, man.

25:40.803 --> 25:44.205
I mean, without him, we wouldn't
have been able to do this.

25:44.206 --> 25:45.158
Wait, what?

25:45.182 --> 25:48.086
He got Becky's name
clear, my name clear.

25:48.110 --> 25:50.278
He's a good man.

25:53.215 --> 25:55.216
And five, six, seven, eight.

25:55.217 --> 25:57.585
One, two, three,

25:57.586 --> 26:00.221
four, five, six, seven, eight.

26:00.222 --> 26:02.791
Perfect. I know Hakeem likes
to jump off stage sometimes,

26:02.792 --> 26:03.902
- but we're not doing that.
- Maya.

26:03.926 --> 26:07.195
You helped me get outside the box.

26:07.196 --> 26:08.596
Meet Lil Buck.

26:08.597 --> 26:10.131
Show her what you do, bro.

26:13.836 --> 26:15.403
Where'd you study, Maya?

26:17.006 --> 26:20.375
I studied at Tisch in NYU.

26:20.376 --> 26:23.044
Where did you study ballet?

26:23.045 --> 26:24.779
Memphis.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.058
Play that beat, Chicken.

26:46.869 --> 26:47.969
Nice.

27:05.788 --> 27:07.622
W-Wow.

27:07.623 --> 27:09.824
You're... you're-you're incredible.

27:09.825 --> 27:11.092
It's like you've created

27:11.093 --> 27:12.460
something completely new.

27:12.461 --> 27:13.795
That's Memphis Jookin.

27:13.796 --> 27:15.797
Now, we know ballet is who you are.

27:15.798 --> 27:18.066
Don't be afraid to try something new.

27:22.471 --> 27:23.972
Kai?

27:26.842 --> 27:28.343
Kai?

27:31.447 --> 27:32.981
Hey.

27:34.316 --> 27:36.150
Hey.

27:36.152 --> 27:38.953
You still leaving?

27:38.954 --> 27:42.257
Yeah. My flight leaves
in a couple hours.

27:42.258 --> 27:45.827
I thought maybe you,
changed your mind.

27:45.828 --> 27:47.362
My dad told me what you did.

27:47.363 --> 27:48.663
Did he tell you what happened?

27:48.664 --> 27:50.231
Yeah. He said that you...

27:50.232 --> 27:52.367
you cleared his name. Thank you.

27:52.368 --> 27:56.371
Did he tell you how he and Andre
dangled a man out of a window

27:56.372 --> 27:58.940
- and threatened to kill him?
- No.

27:58.941 --> 28:00.508
Doesn't really surprise me, though.

28:00.509 --> 28:03.711
I don't know why
I expected anything less.

28:07.249 --> 28:10.385
You know, the first day
that I got into this apartment,

28:10.386 --> 28:13.054
your brother put a gun
to my head, right there.

28:13.055 --> 28:14.956
- I know...
- Look, I-I've seen violence.

28:14.957 --> 28:16.758
I've been threatened by drug cartels

28:16.759 --> 28:18.693
and-and third world dictators.

28:18.694 --> 28:21.195
Violence doesn't scare me.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.201
But, man, your-your family does.

28:27.203 --> 28:30.305
No, they scare me because
of-of what they do to you.

28:30.306 --> 28:34.108
We were so happy in London.

28:34.109 --> 28:35.977
Away from them.

28:39.348 --> 28:40.715
You are nothing like them.

28:40.716 --> 28:42.283
Mal...

28:42.284 --> 28:45.386
please, let's... let's just go home.

28:45.387 --> 28:47.822
Baby, anybody...

28:47.823 --> 28:49.757
who I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with

28:49.758 --> 28:52.193
has to... understand me.

28:53.529 --> 28:55.697
All of me.

28:57.633 --> 28:59.567
I'm a Lyon.

29:03.973 --> 29:06.708
And I'm done apologizing for that.

30:14.098 --> 30:16.065
Hey, Ma. There's someone
I want you to meet.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.600
I don't feel like schmoozing

30:17.601 --> 30:19.569
and small-talking with nobody tonight.

30:19.570 --> 30:21.904
I don't have no business till...

30:21.905 --> 30:23.072
Are you Teri?

30:23.073 --> 30:25.875
Well, is Andre
treating you right tonight?

30:25.876 --> 30:28.444
Because if he's not,
I'll whup his ass into shape.

30:28.445 --> 30:29.875
I wanted to thank you,

30:29.876 --> 30:32.211
mother to mother,
for raising such a good man.

30:32.212 --> 30:34.446
What Andre has done for my son, I...

30:34.447 --> 30:37.049
I can't express how grateful I am.

30:37.050 --> 30:38.984
He's my number one son.

30:38.985 --> 30:42.888
My number one.

30:42.889 --> 30:46.358
This next artist
is the physical manifestation

30:46.359 --> 30:49.528
of the very spirit of Empire itself.

30:49.529 --> 30:51.263
He was critically wounded.

30:51.264 --> 30:53.398
And like the fiery phoenix,

30:53.400 --> 30:55.968
he rose from his own ashes.

30:55.969 --> 30:57.903
He is my son.

30:57.904 --> 31:00.005
He is from my blood.

31:00.006 --> 31:02.341
He is Hakeem...

31:02.342 --> 31:05.143
Lyon...!

31:08.181 --> 31:09.314
Yeah.

31:09.315 --> 31:10.682
Hakeem.

31:12.519 --> 31:14.019
You know this.

31:14.020 --> 31:16.722
Yeah. Yeah.

32:14.347 --> 32:15.958
I need to record this
for Bella, you know.

32:15.982 --> 32:18.717
She loves to see her daddy dance.

32:47.046 --> 32:48.547
Baby.

32:48.548 --> 32:50.182
We got the company back.

32:50.183 --> 32:52.351
Our family's back together.

32:52.352 --> 32:55.420
Come on, what's it gonna take
to turn that frown upside down?

32:55.421 --> 32:57.189
Just because I'm not twerking

32:57.190 --> 32:59.825
doesn't mean I'm tuned out.

33:01.528 --> 33:03.128
What's wrong, baby?

33:03.129 --> 33:04.773
I mean, when you were doing
the press conference,

33:04.797 --> 33:07.099
you said something
about you and me needing

33:07.100 --> 33:09.301
to do better at giving back.

33:09.302 --> 33:10.902
I mean, what was that?

33:10.904 --> 33:12.604
Just what I said.

33:15.508 --> 33:17.876
Do you need to tell me something?

33:25.485 --> 33:27.152
- It's Kingsley.
- Yeah.

33:27.153 --> 33:28.320
He wants to meet.

33:28.321 --> 33:30.822
Enjoy your father-son time.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.861
- All right.
- All right.

33:50.209 --> 33:53.145
How does it feel to be back?

33:57.850 --> 34:01.253
Actually, it feels quite good.

34:03.089 --> 34:05.057
So what are you up to, man?

34:05.058 --> 34:07.125
What do you want?

34:07.126 --> 34:09.360
I'm trying to connect, I guess.

34:09.362 --> 34:11.830
In my own way.

34:16.569 --> 34:19.103
When you stream music
on individual devices,

34:19.105 --> 34:22.040
you guys using AIFF file format?

34:22.041 --> 34:24.676
Mostly.

34:24.677 --> 34:26.545
Some is converted to MP3s

34:26.545 --> 34:29.547
and then the rest is compressed and...

34:29.549 --> 34:32.751
What about the masters? At... 24 bit?

34:32.752 --> 34:34.386
Nah. 32.

34:34.387 --> 34:36.922
Plus, it's got a 96 kilohertz.

34:36.922 --> 34:39.190
You're talking about
the highest quality.

34:39.192 --> 34:40.726
That's why they call it the master.

34:40.726 --> 34:42.860
It gives birth to the other files.

34:42.862 --> 34:44.396
Father of the song.

34:45.732 --> 34:48.333
Touché.

34:48.333 --> 34:51.969
Here's my version of a master file.

34:51.971 --> 34:55.306
It's a program
that searches and destroys.

34:56.476 --> 34:59.177
And right now
it's on the Empire network,

34:59.178 --> 35:01.213
finding all of your early albums

35:01.214 --> 35:03.915
and deleting the master files,
one by one.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.884
Look, son, I know you blame me

35:05.885 --> 35:08.920
for a lot of things in your life.

35:08.921 --> 35:10.856
Especially your mother.

35:10.857 --> 35:13.792
But she was a user
long before she ever met me.

35:13.793 --> 35:17.395
I mean, her addiction...
that's not my doing.

35:17.397 --> 35:19.464
No, I am your doing.

35:20.667 --> 35:24.236
You made me. And now I'm erasing you.

35:25.838 --> 35:28.573
Go home, son.

35:30.009 --> 35:32.477
I get it.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.546
You're a hustler.

35:34.547 --> 35:37.482
You can't be a hustler
without a secret stash, right?

35:37.483 --> 35:39.551
That's why you're acting so cool,

35:39.552 --> 35:41.019
but you think I don't know

35:41.020 --> 35:44.723
about your secret server in London.

35:44.724 --> 35:47.392
This is real.

35:47.393 --> 35:49.861
Just like I am real.

35:55.635 --> 35:57.269
"Roll Up Heavy."

35:57.270 --> 35:58.837
I remember that song. That came out

35:58.838 --> 36:00.672
- when I was in grade school.
- Stop this.

36:00.673 --> 36:02.484
Right around the time
that the courts took custody

36:02.508 --> 36:05.177
away from my mother because
she was hooked on your crack.

36:05.178 --> 36:07.179
There goes "Street King."

36:07.180 --> 36:08.791
Yeah, I remember that one, too.
I was in high school.

36:08.815 --> 36:10.292
Do you know how surreal
that was, to watch all

36:10.316 --> 36:13.518
of my friends dancing
to that song at prom?

36:13.519 --> 36:14.863
Your music... my own father's music...

36:14.887 --> 36:16.655
and I couldn't say a word about it.

36:16.656 --> 36:18.033
Why are you doing this? I mean,
what do you want from me?

36:18.057 --> 36:21.226
- You want my blood?
- I am your blood.

36:21.227 --> 36:24.262
I am your flesh and blood,
and you don't give a damn.

36:24.263 --> 36:26.264
- You never did!
- You think if I had known

36:26.265 --> 36:29.134
you were out there
that I wouldn't have used

36:29.135 --> 36:31.336
all of my power to find you?

36:31.337 --> 36:33.338
So that I could be a father to you?

36:33.339 --> 36:34.973
To raise you? You're my son.

36:34.974 --> 36:36.975
You're a terrible liar.

36:36.976 --> 36:40.011
No, you think... You've got
this picture in your mind

36:40.012 --> 36:43.181
of who you think you are
and who you think I am.

36:43.182 --> 36:45.217
And I know what you're going through,

36:45.218 --> 36:49.688
'cause I had the same picture
in my mind of my father.

36:49.689 --> 36:53.625
It drove me.

36:53.626 --> 36:56.361
But I was wrong.

36:58.598 --> 37:02.100
I see me in you, son.

37:02.101 --> 37:04.436
I see a fire in you

37:04.437 --> 37:08.306
of a young man that
pulled himself up from nothing

37:08.307 --> 37:11.676
by himself, just like me.

37:11.677 --> 37:14.379
That's the Lyon in you.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.314
And if I had known that, I would've...

37:16.315 --> 37:19.417
would've never let you wander
this earth by yourself.

37:19.418 --> 37:23.221
You're a Lyon.

37:23.222 --> 37:25.690
A Lyon.

37:29.061 --> 37:32.464
No.

37:34.634 --> 37:35.834
Now I'm nothing.

37:35.835 --> 37:38.670
Don't say that.

37:38.671 --> 37:40.572
You're my son.

37:59.688 --> 38:02.523
I know that this must be
business as usual for you,

38:02.524 --> 38:05.726
but it was so special for me.

38:05.727 --> 38:07.028
Thank you.

38:07.029 --> 38:08.729
You're very special to me.

38:09.698 --> 38:12.099
Andre, whenever I ask you

38:12.100 --> 38:13.534
to come to church with me,

38:13.535 --> 38:16.303
you-you always have something to do.

38:16.305 --> 38:19.840
I want you to meet my family,
my friends.

38:19.841 --> 38:23.944
You have Empire. I have the church.

38:23.946 --> 38:27.381
But if, you know, if it's a lot to...

38:27.382 --> 38:30.484
Teri, it has nothing to do with you.

38:30.485 --> 38:33.154
My relationship to God is complicated.

38:33.155 --> 38:36.323
Complicated? But... Tell me more.

38:36.325 --> 38:37.758
Another time.

38:37.759 --> 38:40.094
Okay?

38:40.095 --> 38:41.595
Another time.

38:41.596 --> 38:43.197
Well, whenever you're ready,

38:43.198 --> 38:46.467
I'll be right here, holding your hand.

38:48.236 --> 38:51.939
Andre, your nose is bleeding.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.909
It-it's nothing.

38:54.910 --> 38:56.554
- I'd get them in prison every once in...
- Stop the car.

38:56.578 --> 38:58.623
- It's bleeding a lot, Andre.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

38:58.647 --> 39:01.282
Andre!

39:03.185 --> 39:05.119
Andre!

39:10.425 --> 39:12.927
I-I need an ambulance. Andre.

39:12.928 --> 39:15.796
Hold on.

40:03.945 --> 40:06.480
Well...

40:06.481 --> 40:08.516
that's the end of Kingsley.

40:10.552 --> 40:12.153
You want a drink?

40:12.154 --> 40:15.022
No, I'm fine.

40:15.023 --> 40:18.058
I went to see her today. Tracy.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.060
You what?

40:20.062 --> 40:22.029
Why?

40:39.548 --> 40:42.283
Needed to see for myself.
I wanted to get some answers.

40:42.284 --> 40:44.285
Baby, I told you the truth.

40:46.488 --> 40:48.889
You know, when I saw you rapping
on that corner

40:48.890 --> 40:51.192
back in the day,

40:51.193 --> 40:53.327
I thought you were a king.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.229
Even though you ain't had nothing,

40:55.230 --> 40:58.132
you carried yourself like a mack.

40:59.301 --> 41:02.970
But that was the rose-tinted memories.

41:02.971 --> 41:05.406
What's playing in my mind now

41:05.407 --> 41:07.741
is something else.

41:07.742 --> 41:10.010
I see a broken woman

41:10.011 --> 41:12.179
in a hospital bed,

41:12.180 --> 41:15.282
who was too cracked-out
to take care of her own child.

41:15.283 --> 41:17.184
I don't need none of this stuff.

41:17.185 --> 41:19.119
Yeah, just walk away.

41:20.055 --> 41:22.890
Like men do. 'Cause see,
that's what y'all get to do...

41:22.891 --> 41:25.326
turn these hoes off
like a light switch.

41:25.327 --> 41:29.964
What do you want me to say?
What, "I was young",

41:29.965 --> 41:31.799
I didn't-I didn't know, I was a kid"?

41:31.800 --> 41:33.634
We used to tell people

41:33.635 --> 41:35.369
that we did what we had to do
to survive.

41:35.370 --> 41:36.737
That's bull.

41:36.738 --> 41:38.172
We wanted that paper.

41:40.475 --> 41:42.243
I'm not gonna sit here

41:42.244 --> 41:46.647
and-and have to justify
what I did three decades ago

41:46.648 --> 41:49.883
in order to feed my family
in an unfair world.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.485
Hell, the Kennedys, man...

41:51.486 --> 41:54.188
th-they were involved
in illegal substances.

41:54.189 --> 41:55.723
It didn't stop them from becoming

41:55.724 --> 41:58.192
a world friggin' dynasty.
Why can't we do that?

41:58.193 --> 42:01.228
Empire was built on drugs, Lucious.

42:01.229 --> 42:03.797
On people's pain.

42:03.798 --> 42:05.633
My pain. Jamal's pain.

42:05.634 --> 42:08.435
My sister's pain.

42:08.436 --> 42:10.671
A-And we-we keep coming back to it,

42:10.672 --> 42:13.107
over and over and over and over again,

42:13.108 --> 42:16.076
like that junkie chasing
that first high!

42:16.077 --> 42:19.480
Baby, we are not
the same people we were

42:19.481 --> 42:21.548
30 years ago.

42:21.550 --> 42:25.319
I'm not the same man that-that
left you in prison for 17 years.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.488
I mean, we've... Baby, we've done it.

42:27.489 --> 42:29.657
We're here. We-We figured it out.

42:29.658 --> 42:32.893
We did bad things, Lucious,

42:32.894 --> 42:36.563
and it's coming back to collect

42:36.565 --> 42:39.133
with a living, breathing man.

42:39.134 --> 42:42.736
Furious man who calls you Daddy.

42:43.638 --> 42:46.307
Baby.

42:46.308 --> 42:49.143
We're here.

42:49.144 --> 42:50.844
We're right here.

42:50.845 --> 42:52.780
Our future's now.

42:52.781 --> 42:55.115
Are you with me?

43:00.822 --> 43:04.224
Yeah, Lucious. Sure.
