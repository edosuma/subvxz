00:00.184 --> 00:01.668
<i>Previously on "Switched at birth..."</i>

00:01.669 --> 00:03.875
I'm shaking up the starting line-up.
No positions are a lock.

00:03.876 --> 00:07.241
I have done everything for you
and this is how you repay me?

00:07.242 --> 00:09.377
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

00:09.378 --> 00:11.471
I guess you're not the friend
that I thought you were.

00:11.472 --> 00:13.701
You guys want to see if
we can save this team?

00:13.702 --> 00:15.876
- Come on.
- Let's do this!

00:16.687 --> 00:17.454
And I just wanted to tell you

00:17.455 --> 00:18.924
personally that
if I don't get this, I'm gonna

00:18.925 --> 00:19.995
back out of the lawsuit.

00:19.996 --> 00:22.217
Our case will fall apart without you.

00:22.257 --> 00:23.379
I wanted to give you this.

00:23.380 --> 00:26.571
It's just something to help you
out until things turn around.

00:26.572 --> 00:29.059
You're willing to put the trial
on the line to help this woman?

00:29.060 --> 00:31.369
Bay, you never told us that Ty enlisted.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.345
- I guess I forgot to mention it.
- When do you head out?

00:33.346 --> 00:35.211
I leave for Fort Benning on Thursday.

00:35.212 --> 00:38.034
I wanted you to have this.
You can hang it up in Iraq

00:38.035 --> 00:40.540
- or Afghanistan.
- This is really awesome.

00:43.779 --> 00:46.786
You knew that I was into
Ty when you kissed me.

00:46.787 --> 00:48.674
What does it matter anyway?
He's half a world away.

00:51.198 --> 00:53.313
Knock knock! Or... blink blink.

00:53.314 --> 00:57.264
Okay, so you guys left
some stuff in the dryer

00:57.265 --> 01:00.807
and double-K can't resist
a good fluff and fold, so...

01:00.808 --> 01:03.143
<i>Attack on a helicopter
by insurgents marks</i>

01:03.144 --> 01:04.230
<i>one of the deadliest days</i>

01:04.232 --> 01:05.977
- <i>in the war on terror...</i>
- What's happening?

01:06.889 --> 01:09.470
Helicopter crashed in Afghanistan.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.853
It was carrying part of Bolo Company.

01:15.899 --> 01:17.729
That's Ty's company.

01:19.636 --> 01:20.868
I know.

02:31.957 --> 02:33.248
This is bad.

02:33.929 --> 02:36.966
I think Angelo may have
paid off Brizia for her testimony.

02:36.967 --> 02:38.955
I had my investigator keeping tabs on her

02:38.956 --> 02:41.409
and apparently she's had
a sudden influx of cash,

02:41.410 --> 02:44.852
which I'm pretty sure
she didn't get playing scratchers.

02:44.855 --> 02:47.862
I figure since Angelo fled,
he wired Brizia the money...

02:47.863 --> 02:51.365
Angelo didn't give her the money. I did.

02:54.101 --> 02:56.338
- We discussed this.
- Craig, welcome to my world.

02:56.339 --> 02:58.124
And you had nothing to do with this?

02:59.185 --> 03:01.993
John didn't know anything about it,
it was me, on my own.

03:02.244 --> 03:04.595
That woman put her neck
out for this family

03:04.596 --> 03:06.813
and I felt like I needed to do the same.

03:06.814 --> 03:09.416
- and the hospital fired her...
- Kathryn, Kathryn.

03:09.598 --> 03:11.628
How will this affect our case?

03:12.307 --> 03:15.132
Well, that means Brizia can't testify.

03:15.573 --> 03:17.975
Her credibility as witness
is completely compromised,

03:17.976 --> 03:19.509
and with the trial date approaching...

03:19.510 --> 03:22.994
But there has to be some way
Brizia could still testify.

03:24.650 --> 03:28.424
I could maybe ask my investigator
to bury the report.

03:28.425 --> 03:31.078
The chances of the hospital find out
about it are minimal.

03:31.255 --> 03:32.952
But if they did?

03:33.327 --> 03:35.763
Well, it would damage our case, obviously,

03:35.764 --> 03:38.341
and worst case,

03:38.666 --> 03:40.435
I'd get sanctioned by the bar.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.893
- But that's a risk I'm willing to take.
- No.

03:45.748 --> 03:47.864
No, we have to find another way.

05:16.621 --> 05:19.154
Daphne, it's good to have you back

05:19.155 --> 05:20.964
playing for The Mustangs.

05:22.568 --> 05:24.567
I'm not sure everyone feels that way.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.454
What do you mean?

05:28.440 --> 05:29.707
It's nothing.

05:29.844 --> 05:32.382
Did one of the girls say something to you?

05:34.161 --> 05:36.414
No, it's that guy, Travis.

05:36.415 --> 05:38.846
He went off on me for
playing with Buckner.

05:38.847 --> 05:41.697
- He got all crazy.
- Travis.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.875
I can't say it's the first time that
I've heard a complaint like that.

05:46.210 --> 05:48.916
I will talk with him... again.

05:50.176 --> 05:53.364
It's really good to have
you back on the team.

06:18.614 --> 06:20.672
I'm so glad that you're here.

06:25.529 --> 06:26.601
No.

06:27.634 --> 06:28.811
What if it's him?

06:30.565 --> 06:33.029
Oh, I'm there already.

06:33.606 --> 06:36.207
One minute I'm trying
to get used to the idea

06:36.208 --> 06:38.990
that he's gone so that
I'll be prepared for it,

06:38.991 --> 06:41.249
and then the next...

06:41.481 --> 06:42.863
I didn't even know he had

06:42.864 --> 06:45.562
enlisted until a few days before he left,

06:45.563 --> 06:48.240
and I still don't
understand why he did it.

06:51.123 --> 06:53.439
I know but... but do you get it?
Would you do it?

07:04.668 --> 07:05.914
I didn't know that.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.196
Yeah,

07:13.597 --> 07:15.699
which I'm not very good at.

07:16.965 --> 07:20.577
Ty usually responds to
my emails pretty quickly.

07:28.712 --> 07:33.242
Yeah. He has access to
computers over there,

07:35.143 --> 07:38.481
but this is the long ** that has ever 
taken him to get back to me.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.653
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:09.319 --> 09:12.338
How is it going on the Carlton team?

09:12.701 --> 09:13.703
Good.

09:17.595 --> 09:20.952
I've to go do some stuff.

09:26.996 --> 09:29.002
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:32.097 --> 09:34.919
So just out of curiosity,

09:34.920 --> 09:38.738
who's been badmouthing me more,
Bay or Daphne?

09:39.335 --> 09:40.490
Bay's snarkier,

09:40.491 --> 09:44.770
but A.S.L. probably has some
brutal signs for "Bitch."

09:45.439 --> 09:48.237
- What are you talking about?
- Your sisters.

09:48.278 --> 09:49.414
I know they've been giving

09:49.415 --> 09:51.518
you the full court press to dump my ass.

09:52.657 --> 09:53.974
Actually no,

09:53.994 --> 09:55.503
they haven't said anything.

09:55.964 --> 09:58.848
I mean I don't speak "Girl" so...

09:59.270 --> 10:00.184
Huh.

10:00.511 --> 10:02.741
I brought these albums
I was telling you about.

10:02.742 --> 10:06.154
- Cool.
- And I was thinking

10:06.155 --> 10:09.081
that on Saturday
we should go to Take Five.

10:09.082 --> 10:12.053
There's this amazing
singer/songwriter playing.

10:12.054 --> 10:14.031
- Oh yeah? Who?
- You.

10:14.422 --> 10:16.339
I got you the 9:00 time slot.

10:18.187 --> 10:18.835
I can't.

10:18.836 --> 10:22.116
I'm not interfering with
your image or your sound.

10:22.117 --> 10:24.909
- You can wear whatever you want.
- No no, it's not that.

10:25.228 --> 10:26.644
Wilke booked Guitar Face

10:26.645 --> 10:28.739
to play Annie Barker's
party Saturday night.

10:28.740 --> 10:32.258
A kegger? You're passing
this up for the red-cup circuit?

10:32.824 --> 10:35.242
Come on. Can't you get out of it?

10:39.675 --> 10:41.034
- Hey, dad, I...
- Dad, I...

10:41.035 --> 10:43.554
Wow, in stereo.

10:44.841 --> 10:46.204
- Can I talk to you...
- I just have a question...

10:46.205 --> 10:47.955
Uh, whoa whoa whoa.

10:47.956 --> 10:49.589
Just one at a time.

10:52.932 --> 10:54.048
You go.

10:55.098 --> 10:57.432
Okay, remember when you
took that U.S.O. tour

10:57.433 --> 11:00.038
with the royals and you met admiral...

11:00.039 --> 11:02.111
that general guy... he came to dinner?

11:02.112 --> 11:05.151
- General Riken.
- Right.

11:05.436 --> 11:07.996
Well, they still haven't released
any names from Ty's company...

11:07.997 --> 11:11.479
- I already called him.
- You did?

11:11.742 --> 11:12.950
I'm waiting.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.253
I didn't want to say anything
until I'd heard back.

11:18.163 --> 11:19.339
Thank you.

11:21.776 --> 11:24.366
You'll let me know as
soon as you find out?

11:25.293 --> 11:26.408
Yeah.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.027
Your turn.

11:34.066 --> 11:37.160
I saw the "Help wanted"
sign at the car wash

11:37.161 --> 11:39.764
and I know a guy who
could really use a job.

11:39.765 --> 11:42.633
Okay. Is he a friend from school?

11:42.634 --> 11:44.166
He goes to Carlton.

11:44.362 --> 11:46.836
His name's Travis.
He's a really hard worker.

11:47.526 --> 11:49.707
Is he like you or...

11:50.040 --> 11:51.389
more like Emmett?

11:53.427 --> 11:55.077
Do you mean how deaf is he?

11:55.078 --> 11:56.055
Yes.

11:57.185 --> 11:58.567
No. I...

11:59.580 --> 12:00.616
Tell you what.

12:00.617 --> 12:03.136
If you vouch for him, he's got the job.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.576
Catch you later, man.

12:12.412 --> 12:14.239
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.455
I've been working on a set
list for the party Saturday.

12:16.456 --> 12:18.386
Uh, actually something came up

12:18.387 --> 12:19.987
and I gotta bail.

12:20.462 --> 12:23.065
Do you have any idea what
I had to do to get us that gig?

12:23.066 --> 12:24.926
Yeah, you went up to
Annie Barker and said,

12:24.927 --> 12:26.361
"Hey, can we play your party?"

12:26.663 --> 12:28.542
That's not the point.

12:28.995 --> 12:30.669
- It's Simone, isn't it?
- No.

12:30.670 --> 12:33.683
What does she have you doing that night...
painting her toenails?

12:34.219 --> 12:35.544
Something like that.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.724
Annie's sister is the social chair

12:38.725 --> 12:41.260
at U.M.K.C.'s hot girl sorority.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.738
We do good this Saturday
night and we'll be playing

12:42.739 --> 12:44.548
college gigs for the rest of the year.

12:48.692 --> 12:50.444
Come on, man. What are you, Axl Rose?

12:50.445 --> 12:52.265
Gonna start blowing off your band?

12:53.923 --> 12:55.012
Okay.

12:55.261 --> 12:57.382
- Let's do it.
- Thank you.

12:57.383 --> 12:59.855
- All right, see you later.
- Peace.

13:01.934 --> 13:05.057
There were at least a dozen
nurses on duty that day.

13:05.058 --> 13:07.647
Brizia can't be the only
one they overworked.

13:07.651 --> 13:09.371
I'm sure watching Brizia get fired

13:09.372 --> 13:11.848
is just the thing to inspire
others to come forward.

13:11.849 --> 13:13.397
We should at least try.

13:13.599 --> 13:15.066
Our other lawyer already did, sweetie.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.814
She depo'd 'em all, and every one of them

13:16.815 --> 13:18.739
denied any wrongdoing by the hospital.

13:18.740 --> 13:22.621
So did Brizia until Angelo
convinced her to testify.

13:25.659 --> 13:28.019
- What?
- How did Angelo know

13:28.020 --> 13:29.702
to go back to Brizia?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.928
And why did she admit the truth to him?

13:33.068 --> 13:34.758
Other than the obvious reason.

13:34.759 --> 13:36.617
And what is the obvious reason?

13:36.618 --> 13:39.446
Well, he's pretty good-looking, John.

13:39.447 --> 13:41.814
Oh, come on! He's not that good-looking.

13:41.815 --> 13:43.051
Yes, he is.

13:44.054 --> 13:46.784
I'm going to make an appointment
to see Angelo's attorney.

13:46.785 --> 13:49.899
- He's gotta know something.
- Okay,

13:49.945 --> 13:51.990
When you go, please take Craig with you.

13:51.991 --> 13:54.846
Maybe he can stop you from
poisoning the jury pool.

14:11.264 --> 14:12.486
What is this?

14:33.749 --> 14:37.279
If I had double-Ds bolted to my chest.

14:52.887 --> 14:55.279
It's really cool. Thank you.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.098
Hey, sweetie.

14:58.794 --> 14:59.855
Hey, Emmett.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.801
I just heard from General Riken.

15:04.873 --> 15:07.448
Ty is fine. It wasn't him.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.943
He's okay? He's really okay?

15:15.593 --> 15:16.948
Yes, he is.

15:34.671 --> 15:37.345
Well that's it. **
Pretty simple, huh?

15:43.834 --> 15:47.946
- What's he saying?
- He said that he likes the baseball logo.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.022
I thought that up myself.
Pretty cool, huh?

15:50.023 --> 15:53.058
Welcome to the team. If you
have any questions, let me know.

15:53.059 --> 15:55.067
- I got some work to do. Sweetie, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

15:55.068 --> 15:56.435
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:16.450 --> 16:18.833
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey.

16:21.974 --> 16:24.133
Travis, this is Wilke.

16:26.176 --> 16:28.660
Oh, sorry, man. What did he say?

16:29.145 --> 16:31.099
He said nice to meet you.

16:31.196 --> 16:33.450
Oh. You too.

16:39.899 --> 16:43.455
- What's he saying now?
- Nothing. It doesn't matter.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.891
- Can we just go?
- You got it.

16:49.892 --> 16:51.821
- Great.
- Later, man.

17:04.695 --> 17:06.492
Quick: who won the Crimean war?

17:06.492 --> 17:08.315
Uh, the crimeans?

17:08.527 --> 17:10.078
Like I know the answer to that?

17:10.079 --> 17:11.555
But hey, it sounds good.

17:14.103 --> 17:17.446
So what's up? Your text
sounded all serious.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.352
Well look,

17:19.353 --> 17:22.601
I appreciate you setting
up that gig for me...

17:22.742 --> 17:25.760
- Okay?
- But I can't do Take Five.

17:27.856 --> 17:29.766
Wilke dropped the guilt bomb on me

17:29.767 --> 17:31.719
and thinks playing
this gig will open up doors

17:31.720 --> 17:34.117
for us to play parties at U.M.K.C. and...

17:34.118 --> 17:37.912
I guess I was aiming a little
higher than college parties.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.165
I know. I'm sorry.

17:40.822 --> 17:42.699
No, you've gotta do what you gotta do.

17:42.908 --> 17:44.832
Go play with your band.

17:44.922 --> 17:47.233
I'm not Yoko Ono.

17:47.772 --> 17:49.236
Although the idea

17:49.237 --> 17:52.231
of a bed-in with you
does sound kinda good.

17:53.564 --> 17:55.259
Thanks for being so cool about it.

17:55.294 --> 17:56.673
You don't have to thank me,

17:56.982 --> 17:59.068
but you do have to kiss me.

18:14.022 --> 18:16.291
- Thank you.
- Of course.

18:16.392 --> 18:17.390
Hi.

18:19.172 --> 18:20.342
Hi there.

18:22.052 --> 18:23.402
We're here to see Conrad Chaplin.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.300
- I called before.
- Oh yes.

18:25.301 --> 18:27.229
- Can you sign in for me please?
- Sure.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.230
- So do you have a date set?
- June 8th.

18:33.088 --> 18:34.822
You must be so excited.

18:35.226 --> 18:38.572
No, actually. Anxious maybe.

18:38.573 --> 18:41.367
Well then, it's good that
you're getting a pre-nup.

18:44.053 --> 18:44.631
No no no.

18:44.631 --> 18:45.657
You must have us confused.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.967
I'm Kathryn Kennish and
this is my attorney

18:47.968 --> 18:52.373
- Craig Tebbe.
- Oh my god, the switch. I am so embarrassed.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.936
Does that mean you might be available?

18:57.142 --> 18:59.758
Just got out of a long relationship.

18:59.979 --> 19:02.775
- Sorry.
- Oh well.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.520
Have a seat and Connie
will be right with you.

19:10.644 --> 19:12.844
Wow, I cannot believe

19:12.845 --> 19:15.823
that this is the lawyer Angelo hired.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.821
All the magazines are addressed
to the nail salon next door.

19:21.177 --> 19:23.959
She thought we were
a couple about to be married.

19:24.131 --> 19:25.811
And eventually divorced.

19:26.743 --> 19:27.980
She thought you were cute.

19:27.981 --> 19:31.097
- If you play your cards right...
- Not really my type.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.408
Apparently she thinks I'm your type.

19:37.071 --> 19:38.391
Well, full disclosure:

19:38.392 --> 19:40.231
I have always had a thing for redheads,

19:40.232 --> 19:42.604
ever since Mary Jane Watson.

19:42.913 --> 19:44.968
Oh, is that your old girlfriend?

19:45.390 --> 19:46.778
No, spider-man's.

19:49.872 --> 19:51.226
Connie'll see you now.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.925
This way.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.045
So we're playing a kegger this Saturday.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.339
You're gonna be there, right?

20:01.421 --> 20:04.244
I'm sorry, all I got was "Saturday"

20:05.387 --> 20:07.091
and pulled pork sandwich.

20:07.605 --> 20:08.932
Sorry sorry.

20:10.455 --> 20:13.100
Guitar Face. Party Saturday night.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.931
Me on stage. You in the front row,

20:16.134 --> 20:17.385
preferably flashing me.

20:17.386 --> 20:21.234
Mmm, my brother's gonna
be on that same stage.

20:21.571 --> 20:24.582
Good point. Guess we should
leave the flashing to Simone.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.092
Y'know, if she's still
giving you a hard time,

20:29.093 --> 20:32.332
I'm happy to accidentally slam
her shooting hand in her locker.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.296
Just in time for
the Springfield Invitational.

20:34.939 --> 20:36.330
I appreciate the thought,

20:36.331 --> 20:40.819
but we still have to
beat Marshall to qualify.

20:40.860 --> 20:42.271
I don't think that's happening.

20:42.645 --> 20:45.329
Well, maybe with me in
the stands as your good luck charm.

20:46.938 --> 20:47.739
No, seriously how come you

20:47.740 --> 20:49.431
never invite me to your games?

20:50.546 --> 20:51.492
I don't know.

20:51.493 --> 20:54.591
I guess I just didn't
think you'd be interested.

20:54.893 --> 20:57.710
Of course I'm interested. I'm your B.F.

21:00.916 --> 21:03.137
- B.F.?
- Biggest fan.

21:03.583 --> 21:06.661
- What'd you think I meant?
- Ohhh.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.508
Everything okay?

21:16.517 --> 21:18.390
I don't think so.

21:22.326 --> 21:24.488
Look, I have no idea what you're talk...

21:24.489 --> 21:26.461
Wait wait, hold on.

21:26.462 --> 21:27.423
Sweetie, thank god you're here.

21:27.424 --> 21:29.719
Would you please tell
him that he is fired?

21:29.720 --> 21:32.543
- What happened?
- The guy from anthem rent-a-car came by.

21:32.544 --> 21:35.047
He was totally out of line with him.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.803
He kept insisting to speak
with someone who spoke english.

21:39.804 --> 21:40.811
He kept signing to this poor

21:40.812 --> 21:42.599
guy who had no idea what
he was talking about,

21:42.600 --> 21:45.567
except when you showed him
your middle finger. He got that one.

21:45.568 --> 21:47.584
This has to be a mistake.

21:48.979 --> 21:50.041
No.

21:50.269 --> 21:51.934
Do you have any idea how much
business that guy brings in?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.269
I'm sorry. He's your friend.
He has got to go.

21:54.270 --> 21:57.136
I have tried to tell him
"You are fired." I wrote it down.

21:58.595 --> 21:59.939
He doesn't understand.

22:01.416 --> 22:04.260
- He understands.
- Then why is he still here?

22:07.337 --> 22:08.371
What is he saying?

22:10.233 --> 22:11.766
Sweetie, what is he saying?

22:12.884 --> 22:16.528
He said that if you fire him,

22:16.529 --> 22:18.465
he'll sue you for discrimination.

22:18.649 --> 22:19.640
What?!

22:20.923 --> 22:22.797
And he says his shift is over.

22:28.227 --> 22:30.796
Yeah yeah, go.

23:22.191 --> 23:24.290
So you wanna know how
Angelo got Brizia Munoz

23:24.291 --> 23:26.392
to turn against the hospital.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.735
Well, when you find out,

23:29.753 --> 23:31.137
will you tell me?

23:32.323 --> 23:34.754
I... I don't understand.

23:34.755 --> 23:35.963
From the minute he came in here,

23:35.964 --> 23:39.102
Angelo had Brizia all ready to testify.

23:39.743 --> 23:41.324
I'd love to take the credit...

23:41.525 --> 23:45.498
Outside this room I probably will...
but it was all Angelo.

23:45.552 --> 23:47.860
Wait, if you weren't
the one that tracked her down,

23:47.861 --> 23:49.244
how did he even know about Brizia?

23:49.305 --> 23:53.170
- His source tipped him off.
- What source?

23:53.575 --> 23:55.734
Angelo didn't discuss
any of this with you?

23:56.904 --> 23:57.979
No.

23:59.704 --> 24:03.340
Well, I guess we're all
on the same team here.

24:04.528 --> 24:06.397
Somebody contacted Angelo.

24:06.398 --> 24:07.528
Somebody with reliable

24:07.529 --> 24:10.275
information pointed him
in Brizia's direction.

24:10.519 --> 24:12.021
Angelo never gave me a name,

24:12.022 --> 24:15.280
and it wasn't from my lack of asking.

24:15.753 --> 24:18.526
But whoever it is,
they've got enough information

24:18.527 --> 24:21.083
on that hospital to make them pay out

24:21.084 --> 24:23.010
like a busted slot machine.

24:28.857 --> 24:30.322
We have to find Angelo.

24:30.674 --> 24:33.388
Unfortunately for us, he's pretty
good at going off the grid.

24:33.653 --> 24:35.248
I guess I could talk to Regina,

24:35.249 --> 24:37.828
- see if she's heard from him.
- Let's go talk to her.

24:38.151 --> 24:40.095
I think I'd have a little
more luck talking to Regina

24:40.096 --> 24:41.645
without a lawyer present.

24:42.177 --> 24:45.145
Besides, I don't want to keep
you from your other clients.

24:46.645 --> 24:47.737
Actually...

24:48.407 --> 24:51.185
there are no other clients. You're it.

24:55.611 --> 24:58.019
I guess we all have a lot riding on this.

25:03.117 --> 25:05.710
So when your new bike is finished,

25:05.711 --> 25:08.915
I thought that we could

25:08.916 --> 25:10.879
dress her up in

25:11.710 --> 25:13.456
something like this.

25:16.924 --> 25:18.089
Or not.

25:19.373 --> 25:23.883
Maybe we could do something more
"American chopper"?

25:26.884 --> 25:28.875
Something with ghost flames?

25:37.919 --> 25:39.138
What is it?

25:46.990 --> 25:48.144
It's nothing.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.171
Really.

25:53.075 --> 25:54.834
I promise.

25:54.918 --> 25:57.261
But I'm flattered that
you went to the jealousy place.

25:59.149 --> 26:01.382
And now we're at the angry place. Wow.

26:06.514 --> 26:08.045
Okay, it wasn't a secret.

26:09.987 --> 26:11.607
Because it wasn't a big deal.

26:14.289 --> 26:15.305
What?! No!

26:19.054 --> 26:20.489
I would not show

26:20.490 --> 26:22.319
your emails to me to anybody else!

26:28.477 --> 26:29.650
Fine.

26:35.236 --> 26:38.898
Okay, here's the one where he talks about

26:38.899 --> 26:41.157
how you have to keep
hydrated in the desert.

26:41.158 --> 26:44.624
And here's the one where
he talks about M.R.E.S.

26:44.625 --> 26:46.456
They come with flameless ration heaters.

26:46.457 --> 26:49.036
It's very scandalous. And... oh!

26:49.037 --> 26:52.093
This one is a bombshell.
This is the one where I tell him

26:52.094 --> 26:54.129
about the physics paper
that I had to write.

26:54.130 --> 26:55.709
We're practically sexting.

26:56.964 --> 26:58.580
No! Let's keep going.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.050
He caught me doing one.

27:26.526 --> 27:28.407
That is not fair, okay?

27:28.408 --> 27:31.546
You know I cannot sign that fast.

27:31.547 --> 27:32.408
Just give me a chance to respond.

27:35.742 --> 27:37.782
I honestly don't remember.

27:39.289 --> 27:42.565
He's fighting a war that
is half a world away.

27:42.566 --> 27:46.097
I did not think that it was important.

29:17.193 --> 29:18.755
Great news about Ty, huh?

29:19.271 --> 29:21.380
Oh yeah. We're all so relieved.

29:21.466 --> 29:25.026
It was so hard watching Bay not knowing

29:25.027 --> 29:28.116
and not being able to
do anything to help her.

29:28.117 --> 29:29.642
You were there for her.

29:29.963 --> 29:32.772
And sometimes that's all we can do.

29:33.829 --> 29:35.299
Regina, um,

29:35.876 --> 29:39.217
you haven't been in touch
with Angelo, have you?

29:39.364 --> 29:40.367
No.

29:41.147 --> 29:41.959
Why?

29:42.648 --> 29:46.125
It turns out he had
this source that tipped him off

29:46.126 --> 29:49.107
that the hospital was
overworking its nurses,

29:49.698 --> 29:52.382
and I really need to find that source.

29:52.383 --> 29:56.174
And Angelo is the only
person who knows who it is.

29:59.813 --> 30:02.294
A couple weeks ago I had
a missed call from him.

30:02.570 --> 30:04.266
But when I called the number back,

30:04.371 --> 30:05.936
it had been disconnected.

30:07.729 --> 30:09.469
I don't know where he is.

30:11.304 --> 30:12.904
Thanks anyway.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.861
But if you hear from him,
you'll let me know right?

30:18.287 --> 30:19.579
Of course.

30:20.229 --> 30:21.331
Thanks.

30:30.559 --> 30:31.814
Yo, T-bow.

30:32.783 --> 30:35.439
You're going to eventually
run out of "T" names for me.

30:37.549 --> 30:39.805
The gig at Annie Barker's is a no-go.

30:39.806 --> 30:41.402
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:41.403 --> 30:43.446
Somebody dropped a dime on
Annie and told her parents

30:43.447 --> 30:45.653
she was gonna throw a rager
while they were out of town.

30:46.006 --> 30:47.689
Well, that's completely uncool.

30:48.029 --> 30:50.356
Look on the bright side:
your Saturday night's freed up.

30:50.357 --> 30:51.285
Now you can play "Find the tan"

30:51.286 --> 30:53.579
"lines" with Simone or whatever
it was you had planned.

30:53.864 --> 30:55.092
Yeah, I guess so.

31:13.566 --> 31:16.849
Uh, you must go to school with Travis.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.406
Yeah, I go to Carlton.

31:20.407 --> 31:23.988
Oh, you talk! Great. C'mon in.

31:26.152 --> 31:28.752
He's in his room playing video games.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.929
All night long.

31:34.081 --> 31:36.697
I'm sorry, you didn't tell me your name.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.077
Daphne.

31:47.868 --> 31:50.623
Your friend Daphne is here to see you.

31:55.873 --> 31:59.458
You should clean this up,
if you're gonna have company over.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.319
Nice.

33:33.983 --> 33:35.551
Good timing, sexy.

33:35.994 --> 33:36.965
Okay.

33:38.890 --> 33:41.398
So that kegger we were playing went south.

33:41.550 --> 33:42.610
Really?

33:42.805 --> 33:45.592
So you could still play Take Five?

33:45.772 --> 33:48.274
Well yeah, but I'm sure
they've filled my spot by now.

33:48.619 --> 33:52.130
Well, that's when having
an absentminded girlfriend

33:52.131 --> 33:53.523
really comes in handy.

33:53.524 --> 33:56.108
I completely forgot to call and cancel.

33:56.209 --> 33:58.584
- So I can still play?
- Yep.

34:01.732 --> 34:04.178
Were you the one who narc'd
on Annie Barker's party?

34:04.293 --> 34:05.364
No.

34:07.655 --> 34:09.393
Okay. It was me,

34:09.416 --> 34:12.130
in the billiard room with the candlestick.

34:12.130 --> 34:14.467
- That's not funny.
- I know.

34:14.966 --> 34:17.839
And honestly? It's a little scary.
I mean, who does that?

34:17.850 --> 34:20.101
The cops were gonna bust
that party 10 minutes in,

34:20.101 --> 34:22.228
just like they did the last time,

34:22.444 --> 34:23.882
and you would have completely

34:23.884 --> 34:26.263
missed this opportunity.
we talked about this.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.431
When it comes to the music stuff,
I want you to stay out of it.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.518
I'm sorry. I care about you.

34:30.518 --> 34:32.627
I want big things for you.

34:35.764 --> 34:37.091
Can you forgive me?

34:38.732 --> 34:39.960
I don't know.

34:47.246 --> 34:48.382
Come in.

34:50.618 --> 34:51.833
Come in!

35:13.147 --> 35:15.860
You want to work here.
You want to work here?

35:15.933 --> 35:17.187
I thought you quit.

35:20.730 --> 35:22.677
Two? I don't... I don't...

35:25.878 --> 35:27.679
You want me to pay you double?!

35:38.695 --> 35:40.609
"Can you give me a second chance?"

35:50.141 --> 35:52.047
Okay, I want to tell you something:

35:52.201 --> 35:55.998
everybody here gets one screw up,

35:56.032 --> 35:57.654
and you already used yours.

35:58.465 --> 35:59.799
You got it?

36:08.768 --> 36:11.636
You were right about the rent-a-car guy.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.094
He's a jerk.

36:13.482 --> 36:17.176
But if I have to be nice to him,
you have to be nice to him.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.651
Do you understand?

36:19.556 --> 36:20.579
Okay.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.539
Welcome back.

36:25.686 --> 36:26.859
You're welcome.

36:39.506 --> 36:41.832
- Kathryn!
- In here.

36:43.841 --> 36:46.266
Any luck finding Angelo's "Deep throat"?

36:46.267 --> 36:48.940
No. The only one who seems
to know anything about him

36:48.941 --> 36:51.344
is Angelo and god knows where he is.

36:51.389 --> 36:53.497
Oh, so we're right back where we started...

36:54.082 --> 36:55.659
No credible witness.

36:56.550 --> 36:58.483
We had one, just not anymore.

36:59.110 --> 37:00.715
You know, at some point,

37:00.716 --> 37:03.003
you're going to have to
stop being mad at me.

37:03.004 --> 37:05.232
You think I like being mad at you?

37:05.256 --> 37:07.499
I thought we were in
this together as a team,

37:07.500 --> 37:10.131
but lately you've been
acting like a free agent.

37:26.852 --> 37:29.763
I wanted to be able to see your hands.

37:30.135 --> 37:32.881
So they don't venture
into uncharted territory?

37:33.461 --> 37:37.252
No, I want to try communicating
in sign language.

37:37.253 --> 37:39.874
- No voices.
- Okay.

37:39.875 --> 37:43.621
All right, what's the sign for
"Wilke is the greatest bass player"

37:43.622 --> 37:45.019
"since Geddy Lee"?

37:46.006 --> 37:46.710
You know there's not just

37:46.711 --> 37:49.755
one sign that covers all of that, right?

37:50.939 --> 37:53.072
Okay, let's start with something simple,

37:53.073 --> 37:57.453
like your name sign.
Mine is "Happy" with a "D."

37:57.815 --> 38:00.739
It should be "Happy" with an "H-o-t."

38:01.193 --> 38:03.659
And yours is this.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.976
So you make the letter "W"

38:05.977 --> 38:08.015
and then you swoosh it back

38:08.016 --> 38:09.976
like you're sweeping back your hair.

38:10.847 --> 38:12.785
That's a little vain, isn't it?

38:13.055 --> 38:15.033
You are a little vain.

38:15.048 --> 38:16.466
You got me there.

38:17.827 --> 38:18.956
Perfect!

38:19.532 --> 38:21.586
I think I want a new one.
Wouldn't it be cooler

38:21.587 --> 38:23.190
if my name sign was this?

38:24.586 --> 38:27.170
Well, you can't pick your own name sign.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.439
A deaf person has to give it to you.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.869
But I could totally talk to
Emmett if you think that...

38:31.870 --> 38:33.845
No no. It's okay.

38:35.436 --> 38:36.605
Very nice.

38:37.191 --> 38:39.553
Well, you know how good
I am with my hands.

38:40.430 --> 38:42.576
I need you to take this seriously.

38:43.114 --> 38:44.695
It's kind of a big deal.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.869
I know. Okay. I'm sorry.

38:46.870 --> 38:49.725
How do you say, "I want to make out"?

38:50.724 --> 38:52.187
C'mon, it's like spanish class.

38:52.188 --> 38:55.384
The best way to pick it up is to
learn phrases you use every day.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.816
- I want...
- Mm-hmm.

39:00.817 --> 39:02.136
To make out.

39:02.282 --> 39:04.185
I thought you'd never ask.

39:18.928 --> 39:20.784
Oh, are we being audited?

39:20.785 --> 39:22.986
No, it's just lawsuit stuff.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.122
Oh.

39:27.924 --> 39:29.076
What's going on?

39:30.698 --> 39:33.400
If someone did something
that you didn't agree with...

39:33.401 --> 39:35.617
- Uh-huh.
- And they lied to you about it,

39:35.812 --> 39:38.042
but they were doing it
to try to help you out,

39:39.175 --> 39:40.874
would you still be mad at them?

39:41.550 --> 39:44.303
It's hard to say without the specifics.

39:45.597 --> 39:47.471
Well, you're not gonna get any.

39:49.117 --> 39:50.971
Well, I'm assuming this isn't about

39:51.121 --> 39:55.073
drugs, or gambling or
getting someone pregnant?

39:55.779 --> 39:58.370
- We're good so far.
- Thank god.

39:59.843 --> 40:02.084
Well, then I guess I would say

40:02.264 --> 40:04.804
I would have to give them
the benefit of the doubt.

40:06.478 --> 40:08.630
Okay. Thanks, mom.

40:09.993 --> 40:11.143
Toby?

40:12.448 --> 40:14.517
You know who Mary Jane Watson is?

40:14.867 --> 40:16.806
- Spider-man's girlfriend?
- Yeah.

40:16.807 --> 40:19.034
She's pretty, right?

40:19.974 --> 40:21.938
Yeah, a totally hot redhead.

40:22.310 --> 40:25.161
Kinda ballsy too. Why?

40:25.437 --> 40:28.259
Oh, just wondering.

40:42.019 --> 40:43.094
Hello?

40:44.415 --> 40:45.817
Hell-ooo.

40:46.471 --> 40:49.523
- Bay, can you hear me?
- Ty?

40:50.019 --> 40:51.789
Yeah, it's me.

40:52.049 --> 40:54.341
I'm okay. I got your emails. How are you?

40:54.342 --> 40:56.145
How am I? How are you?

40:56.146 --> 40:58.754
I was so worried.

40:58.755 --> 41:00.004
No, I know, I know,

41:00.005 --> 41:02.108
but I'm being really careful over here.

41:02.475 --> 41:05.957
- How is everybody?
- They're all really glad that you're okay.

41:07.220 --> 41:08.390
What about you?

41:10.496 --> 41:11.588
I'm good.

41:13.564 --> 41:16.168
Hey, you gotta send me another
one of those Hammer Girls.

41:16.169 --> 41:17.281
I talked my commander into

41:17.282 --> 41:19.320
letting me put it on
the top of our Humvee.

41:19.928 --> 41:21.836
I can definitely do that.

41:22.485 --> 41:23.875
When my tour's done, you

41:23.876 --> 41:26.163
and me'll go plaster
the town in those things.

41:27.876 --> 41:30.364
Never thought I'd miss
the smell of wheat paste.

41:32.377 --> 41:34.077
Bay, are you there?

41:34.448 --> 41:37.811
Listen, I know we didn't make
any promises to each other,

41:37.812 --> 41:40.932
and you probably don't even care,

41:41.271 --> 41:44.329
but I started seeing someone...

41:44.959 --> 41:46.139
actually.

41:49.055 --> 41:51.552
It's Emmett... Emmett Bledsoe.

41:54.561 --> 41:57.279
- Ty, are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.612
And hey, that's great.
Emmett's a really good guy.

42:00.613 --> 42:01.680
I know.

42:03.779 --> 42:06.535
I... I just thought I should tell you.

42:08.116 --> 42:10.488
It's no problem. Well listen,

42:11.013 --> 42:12.930
there's a lotta guys lined
up here to use the phone,

42:12.931 --> 42:14.688
so I should probably wrap it up.

42:14.689 --> 42:16.373
Okay, um...

42:16.559 --> 42:18.209
but I'll talk to you later.

42:18.215 --> 42:20.199
Yeah, definitely.

42:20.840 --> 42:21.985
Okay.

42:24.889 --> 42:27.951
Ty?

42:32.799 --> 42:35.809
Bye.
