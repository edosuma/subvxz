WEBVTT

00:07.670 --> 00:09.620
mom.

00:10.090 --> 00:11.660
Sarah.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.880
What are you doing here?

00:13.890 --> 00:15.050
Did you spend the night?

00:15.070 --> 00:16.329
I don't know,sherlock.

00:16.340 --> 00:17.690
What do you think?

00:17.710 --> 00:19.120
Oh,my god.

00:19.130 --> 00:21.280
you slept with the architect.

00:21.290 --> 00:23.460
And who were you with?

00:26.210 --> 00:27.900
rebecca.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.250
Morning.

00:30.260 --> 00:32.490
good morning to you.

00:36.010 --> 00:38.260
Justin still sleeping?

00:38.520 --> 00:40.950
Uh,I don't know where justin is.

00:41.220 --> 00:42.900
Oh.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.220
- Did the party just end?
- No,hours ago.

00:45.230 --> 00:47.640
We just ran into each other,just now.

00:47.650 --> 00:49.530
Oh.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.380
must have been some party.

00:57.130 --> 00:59.430
48 hours earlier

01:00.960 --> 01:02.250
Oh,my god.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.750
- The texture...
- I know.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.240
Reclaimed timber has such character.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.410
It's perfect.I love it.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.690
- As for the window
- can I see that?

01:10.700 --> 01:13.130
this glass comes with
a specialized glaze

01:13.140 --> 01:17.430
that blocks the sun's radiation.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.800
Uh,it--it's a
cancer house.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.340
I would avoid radiation.

01:20.350 --> 01:23.760
That way,you'll save on heating
and air conditioning costs.

01:24.570 --> 01:26.940
Let's do it,all of it.

01:27.090 --> 01:30.000
- dual flush toilets..who knew?
- Europe.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.040
Nora,you have no idea
what a pleasure it is

01:32.050 --> 01:35.550
to be working with someone
with so much passion.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.420
Well,it'S...

01:37.430 --> 01:39.740
it's all so exciting.

01:40.150 --> 01:41.780
Oh,my god.What time...

01:41.790 --> 01:43.480
I've gotta pick up paige from school.

01:43.490 --> 01:46.640
I'll work out a budget,and then
we can,uh,take it from there.

01:46.650 --> 01:48.540
Roger...

01:48.550 --> 01:51.330
have I mentioned how grateful I am?

01:51.340 --> 01:52.780
Please,nora.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.950
It's my pleasure.

01:57.630 --> 01:59.060
Alwa good to see you,saul.

01:59.070 --> 02:01.080
Cheerio.

02:02.450 --> 02:06.150
- Okay,so when did you two fall in lust?
- What?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.890
Nora,I thought you were gonna
practically jump him right

02:07.900 --> 02:10.070
on top of the reclaimed wood sample.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.980
What are you talking
about?We were working.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.910
You were drooling.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.800
Oh.go away.

02:15.810 --> 02:17.140
you see that car?

02:17.150 --> 02:19.100
That's where will be
living with my two children.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.260
And I think you're
being a tad melodramatic.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.090
Really?

02:22.100 --> 02:25.120
I took out a second mortgage
on my home for greenatopia.

02:25.130 --> 02:28.240
I needed this conference
to be a huge success.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.830
It was,sarah.It went really well.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.590
Except I didn't know what twitter was.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.850
You knew what twitter was,you
just didn't know how it works.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.550
Well,that would've been okay,

02:35.560 --> 02:39.420
except it was at a tech conference
and I'm supposed to be a "techie.

02:39.430 --> 02:42.450
" To make matters worse,the question was
asked by our biggest potential investor.

02:42.470 --> 02:44.460
I'm telling you,it's fine.We covered.

02:44.470 --> 02:46.610
Yeah,whatever.Arlo natterson
probably didn't even notice.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.510
No,arlo natterson would've
noticed because he's successful,

02:48.520 --> 02:50.280
and successful people
notice every detail,

02:50.290 --> 02:52.200
and he's a 20-something partier,

02:52.210 --> 02:55.020
and I'm a divorced mother
of 2 who doesn't twitter

02:55.030 --> 02:57.080
and doesn't have a facebook page.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.110
Before you move into your car,

02:58.120 --> 03:00.970
arlo natterson is coming to our
launch party tomorrow night,okay?

03:00.980 --> 03:01.940
He must be interested.

03:01.950 --> 03:06.370
Guys,this party--it's--it's--
it's gotta be off the hook.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.630
Or is it chain?

03:07.640 --> 03:09.100
- Hook's fine.
- Whatever.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.010
Guys,tomorrow night is
our last chance to impress.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.440
We're goa impress.Don't
worry about it,all right?

03:14.450 --> 03:16.320
We got a swanky hotel rooftop,

03:16.330 --> 03:19.090
we got solar-powered plasmas
broadcasting the web site...

03:19.100 --> 03:20.790
We got D.J.Dash spinning
the ones and twos

03:20.800 --> 03:23.020
oh,good.Did he confirm?

03:23.030 --> 03:25.260
S-she did,yeah.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.460
that'll be rebecca.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.690
She's doing the swag bags.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.370
hey.Oh,hey,paigey.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.500
Listen,honey,um,grandma's
gonna pick you up

03:32.510 --> 03:35.810
and take you shopping
for your party dress.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.970
No,honey.I-- I'm--I'm
too busy.I'm sorry.

03:38.980 --> 03:42.560
You can--you can buy
anything you want under $40.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.800
I love you,too,babe.

03:45.810 --> 03:46.850
where were we?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.690
Uh,you didn't know who D.J.Dash was.

03:50.510 --> 03:51.660
Oh,yeah.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.780
and each bottle,with
our new organic label...

03:55.790 --> 04:00.040
Will come with this trifold with
all of the brand information.

04:00.060 --> 04:01.320
That's great.

04:01.330 --> 04:04.550
Listen,I know you're not
thrilled about supporting sarah,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.560
but I really think it's
good,cheap advertising.

04:06.570 --> 04:07.970
Mm,who cares about sarah?

04:07.980 --> 04:11.230
I just wish tommy was here to
see what a great job you're doing.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.240
- Is he still in ojai?
- Yes.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.310
Thanks to your brilliant idea,

04:15.320 --> 04:19.019
he's there trying to partner
up with a neighboring orchard.

04:19.029 --> 04:22.940
My daughter-- ojai's
resident rock star.

04:25.750 --> 04:28.730
one person's rock star,another
person's bad girlfriend.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.680
Excuse me.hey.

04:30.690 --> 04:32.770
Yeah,listen,um,about tonight.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.730
I...

04:34.740 --> 04:37.230
no,I don't think I can make it.

04:37.950 --> 04:41.830
Well,no,it's just,there's so many last-minute
things to do for the party,and I...

04:42.410 --> 04:44.490
justin,I'm sorry.

04:45.260 --> 04:47.560
Okay.Bye.

04:48.660 --> 04:51.210
it's hard,I know.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.750
Believe me.I could never pull it off.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.370
What,a healthy relationship?

04:56.380 --> 05:02.760
Well,that,too,but I-I was talking about
balance between relationships and work.

05:02.770 --> 05:06.340
It probably explains my
relationship with william.

05:06.400 --> 05:11.450
I mean,being with a married man--
he didn't make too many demands.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.300
Oh,I just really want
this to work with justin.

05:13.310 --> 05:16.420
Well,you're gonna see him at
the party tomorrow nightright?

05:16.430 --> 05:18.910
Yeah,but I'm gonna be working.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.650
Although,we did reserve
a block of rooms.

05:22.660 --> 05:24.820
Not that you need to know that.

05:24.830 --> 05:27.710
you know,I'm not really
that shocked over the idea

05:27.720 --> 05:30.770
of the two of you
sharing a room together.

05:32.220 --> 05:34.470
um...rebeA...

05:34.480 --> 05:36.850
you have been working really hard.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.690
Why don't you take off the next day?

05:39.700 --> 05:42.450
- Really?
- Balance?

05:42.670 --> 05:44.750
One of us should try it.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.730
hey,daffy.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.610
Check out the action on this
one.I think you'll like it.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.890
I can't believe I
actually agreed to do this.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.420
You know I hate hunting?

05:55.430 --> 05:56.850
I'm much more of a gatherer.

05:56.860 --> 05:58.150
I mean,killing baby birds?

05:58.160 --> 05:59.380
- They're quail.
- Oh,right.

05:59.390 --> 06:00.670
Because killing baby bds would be mean.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.880
Oh,don't act like you've
never been hunting before.

06:02.890 --> 06:04.820
Kitty told me about the trips
you used to take with your dad.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.350
Yeah,in her mind,they were fun,okay?

06:06.360 --> 06:08.360
From my vantage point,it
was forced labor.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.250
Okay,I'm forcing you.

06:10.260 --> 06:11.760
Gordon alexander was the first step.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.860
Now we gotta get wade newman.

06:13.870 --> 06:16.550
The both of them are the keys
to the funding,the endorsements

06:16.560 --> 06:18.120
I know.He's the key to
the gernor's mansion.

06:18.130 --> 06:19.760
I get it.I just hate their politics.

06:19.770 --> 06:24.310
I mean,come on--anti- social
security,antiabortion,anti-gay rights.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.360
You know,I-I really wish you'd fill kitty
in on your secret little run for governor.

06:29.370 --> 06:31.150
You could take her then instead of me.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.450
Well,if it doesn't go well,I won't
have to fill her in on anything.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.220
- Fill me in on what?
- Hey,kitty.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.430
You know,how I'm dreading
this little hunting safari.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.490
And I keep telling him he's gotta
cultivate these relationships.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.680
Well,you know what?He's right,kev.

06:43.690 --> 06:47.370
And--and gordon and
wade,they're not so bad.

06:47.660 --> 06:48.860
Oh.

06:48.870 --> 06:51.220
Oh,are you gonna use her?

06:51.230 --> 06:52.660
It's a her?

06:52.670 --> 06:54.890
Oh,yeah.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.400
Nice.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.600
You look so hot.

07:01.840 --> 07:06.380
well,I'm on my way to san francisco
for a photo shoot for my book.

07:06.390 --> 07:07.760
You know,kev,come on,think about it.

07:07.770 --> 07:10.360
Dad would be so proud.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.120
Oh,sorry I'm late.

07:12.130 --> 07:14.040
Day from hell.

07:14.050 --> 07:16.550
Oh,no.The presentation went badly?

07:16.560 --> 07:19.140
I don't know how to twitter and
I don't have a facebook page.

07:19.150 --> 07:23.760
I dot know who wants to invest in a
start-up with an out-of-touch C.F.O.

07:23.770 --> 07:26.940
- You're not out of touch.
- Says my mother.

07:26.950 --> 07:29.170
Um,sweetheart,before paige comes down,

07:29.180 --> 07:30.180
I just want to warn you,

07:30.190 --> 07:33.750
she picked out a few items that are
a little more grown-up than usual.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.080
Oh,good.I'm so over the princess thing.

07:36.090 --> 07:38.620
She said that you said she
could wear whatever she wanted.

07:38.630 --> 07:41.050
She's so excited about this dance party.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.670
I know.I've heard all about it.

07:42.680 --> 07:47.610
And then chloe told her that otis told
connor that he thinks she's pretty.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.720
Otis?

07:51.410 --> 07:53.310
ta-da!

07:54.820 --> 07:56.760
what do you think?

07:57.090 --> 08:00.160
You look very cute,sweetie.

08:01.470 --> 08:03.150
Sarah?

08:05.220 --> 08:08.720
Paige,go upstairs
and--and take that off.

08:10.690 --> 08:14.550
- But,mom
- now.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.330
mom,what you're thinking?

08:28.340 --> 08:31.260
You're the one who told her she
could get whatever she wanted.

08:31.270 --> 08:34.750
I didn't expect you to take her to
frederick's of hollywood for juniors.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.970
Sarah,you don't need to yell at me,

08:35.980 --> 08:38.610
and you didn't need to embarrass paige.

08:38.620 --> 08:41.250
I've been through this before,twice.

08:41.260 --> 08:45.980
Do you remember your rocker phase
and--and kitty and her spandex?

08:45.990 --> 08:47.230
My god.I was horrified.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.500
Well,at least my butt was covered.

08:48.510 --> 08:51.460
But you were just exploring-- same
thing paige is doing right now.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.160
She can explore in her bedroom,

08:53.170 --> 08:56.870
but she's not going out looking like
hannah-montana- meets-a-call-girl.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.620
You're overreacting.

08:58.630 --> 09:01.060
And the thing is,paige feels great.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.420
That's what's important.

09:02.430 --> 09:06.210
There's time enough for her to feel
self-conscious and insecure later on.

09:06.220 --> 09:09.500
My god,I can't even put on something
sleeveless without thinking twice.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.680
Well,this is not about
your insecurity,mother.

09:11.690 --> 09:12.750
This...

09:12.760 --> 09:15.270
is about paige,who is
still a little girl.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.400
She's growing up.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.060
No,mom,you don't--
you don't understand.

09:18.070 --> 09:20.650
It's all happening so early these days.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.540
And it just--it-- it
scares the crap out of me.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.760
have you had the talk with her?

09:30.460 --> 09:32.750
The talk?

09:33.430 --> 09:34.970
Yes,I've had the talk.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.890
It isn't just one talk,honey.

09:36.900 --> 09:42.270
Studies say that you have to keep the
lines of communication open forever.

09:42.550 --> 09:46.400
Well,right now I don't really have time
to open any more lines of communication.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.890
The tech conference was a disaster.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.320
We have this party tomorrow night,

09:49.330 --> 09:54.250
and my entire career and
financial stability...

09:54.260 --> 09:56.500
hang in the balance.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.280
May I have the receipt,please?

09:58.290 --> 10:00.970
Oh,sarah.

10:00.980 --> 10:03.710
This is not about the outfit.

10:04.110 --> 10:07.140
I have no idea what you're
talking about,mother.

10:07.150 --> 10:09.550
Paige.

10:15.970 --> 10:17.770
you really drink that stuff?

10:17.780 --> 10:18.970
Oh,no.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.300
It's not-- it's
not that bad.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.130
I'm,uh,I'm--I'm
justin.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.260
I know.I'm chelsea.

10:25.270 --> 10:28.430
I really liked what you
said about feeling stuck

10:28.440 --> 10:31.110
while everyone else
moves on with their lives.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.420
Unfortunately,I relate.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.650
well,thank
you.That--yeah,that's good.

10:36.660 --> 10:38.980
- Not,not that,um,you could
- I know what you meant.

10:38.990 --> 10:40.940
Okay.

10:41.450 --> 10:45.100
look,I'm new here,and I'm
supposed to find a sponsor,

10:45.110 --> 10:49.730
and I mean,I don't know if you
already have,like,a ton of sponsees,

10:49.740 --> 10:52.340
but-- um,uh,no,I-I-I
don't have any.

10:52.350 --> 10:57.330
But they,um,they-- they sort of frown
on-- on opposite sex partnerships.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.480
- That's weird.
- It is weird.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.090
What if I were gay?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.680
Good point.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.730
************

11:04.740 --> 11:08.720
*******

11:08.730 --> 11:11.690
yeah,it is hard to--to find
the right person sometimes.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:14.880 --> 11:19.660
Well,then what if it were
tempory,until I found a female sponsor?

11:21.450 --> 11:22.680
I'm sorry.

11:22.690 --> 11:24.360
You know,if this makes
you feel uncomfortable

11:24.370 --> 11:25.920
no,no,no,no,it's--it's
not.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.390
I...

11:28.480 --> 11:30.290
look,I--I've been coming to
these meetings for a long time,

11:30.300 --> 11:31.460
so anything I've learned,

11:31.470 --> 11:35.030
I-I would like to-- to
share with someone else.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.190
- Is that a yes?
- That is a yes.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.420
it's a "for now" yes,a "for now" yes.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.440
Thank you.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.680
that was ethan calling from the site.

11:44.690 --> 11:47.810
The sola he says it looks amazing.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.790
Oh,good,'cause the
swag bags look great,too

11:49.800 --> 11:53.000
the drinking bottle and the
gift certificate from caf raw.?

11:53.010 --> 11:54.180
What is caf raw?

11:54.190 --> 11:55.650
It's a little caf on third.?

11:55.660 --> 11:57.850
Would it be the kind of
place that arlo likes to go?

11:57.860 --> 12:00.360
- Who's arlo?
- I'm sure he's there every day for lunch.

12:00.370 --> 12:01.710
So long as we make a good impression,

12:01.720 --> 12:05.290
you know,a
young,hip,cutting-edge impression.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.330
This is cute.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.870
- That is paige'S.
-Wow.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.030
Now that would make an impression.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.420
Well,it's not the kind of impression
I want my daughter to make.

12:13.430 --> 12:17.250
You know,maybe if she's 15,but
even then...she's 10 years old.

12:17.260 --> 12:19.460
She's kind of going through
that experimental phase.

12:19.470 --> 12:23.020
Why does everybody say that
it's okay?She's 10 years old.

12:23.030 --> 12:25.420
She should be playing with dolls
or wanting a pony or something,

12:25.430 --> 12:29.270
not wanting to be some
fallen teenop star.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.830
Well,uh,my mom used to let me dress
up like madonna,and she didn't care.

12:32.840 --> 12:33.870
I ided her closet.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.290
You think I'm gonna take
parenting tips from your mama?

12:36.300 --> 12:39.510
Okay,I get that you're completely entitled
to have a mom freak out about this,

12:39.520 --> 12:41.250
but not now.You member
what you said to me?

12:41.260 --> 12:43.550
You said we gotta concentrate
on the party and arlo.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.790
Well,I'll be concentrating at
the mall for the next 30 minutes.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.740
- No.
- I'll be on my cell phone.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.930
- Sarah
- you guys keep doing what you're doing.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.800
- No!Sarah.
- I'll be 30 minutes.

12:53.090 --> 12:54.550
All right.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.190
Okay,just breathe.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.250
Breathe through it.Start
with the water bottl.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.420
We gotta get the water
bottles in the bags.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.580
Okay?

13:04.140 --> 13:05.160
Can I just shoot him now?

13:05.170 --> 13:07.220
Come on.Cheney got away with it.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.920
I think that would severely inhibit
my ances at the governorship.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.000
Gordon!

13:13.010 --> 13:14.230
- How you doing?
- I'm hunting.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.510
How could I be bad?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.360
Wade,been a long ti.

13:17.370 --> 13:21.180
I think the last time we saw each
other,we were arguing about something.

13:21.190 --> 13:22.940
The veteran's benefit bill.

13:22.950 --> 13:23.940
This is kevin walker.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.170
He's my communications director.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.540
Pleased to meet you.Beautiful dogs.

13:26.550 --> 13:27.920
Train 'em myself.

13:27.930 --> 13:29.430
It's a lot like raisi children.

13:29.440 --> 13:34.280
Trick is,you can't baby 'em,otherwise
they get soft,like democrats.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.520
- no offense,kevin.
- Oh,that'sight.

13:35.530 --> 13:36.520
We're hunting with the enemy.

13:36.530 --> 13:38.520
Ah,now,now,guys,come on.

13:38.530 --> 13:40.430
If it flies,it dies.

13:40.730 --> 13:43.020
are you joking?

13:43.030 --> 13:48.240
Roger,you know my budget,and this
is tens of thousands of dollars over.

13:48.250 --> 13:51.590
You did say yes to
everything,and unfortunately,

13:51.600 --> 13:55.060
most eco-sustainable
materials are slightly pricier.

13:55.070 --> 13:55.730
Slightly?

13:55.740 --> 13:59.420
But you'll get it back because of the
energy you save by using the materials.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.210
Oh,come on.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.420
What's happened to your passion?

14:02.430 --> 14:04.530
I can't afford my passion.

14:04.550 --> 14:05.700
Roger,this is a charity.

14:05.710 --> 14:10.500
I don't have the money to build an eco-center
that you can showcase in your brochures.

14:10.510 --> 14:14.250
Books,notrochures,and trust me,I-I--I'm
fully aware this is a charity,

14:14.260 --> 14:17.540
just as you're aware that I'm
providing my services pro bono.

14:17.550 --> 14:22.900
Not that I'm not enjoying every
moment of our collaboration.

14:25.810 --> 14:28.050
Oh,no.You
know,don't--don't do that.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.350
Don't flirt with me.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.520
You're just trying to get
your hands on my solar panels.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.850
Well,it seems to be working.

14:33.860 --> 14:34.690
You're blushing.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.510
I am not blushing.

14:36.530 --> 14:39.390
I'm--I'm--I'm
flushed.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.510
I'm double flushed...

14:40.520 --> 14:45.460
like your toilets and your budget,which
is giving me a massive headache.

14:46.930 --> 14:47.830
hello.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.940
Mom,it's me.Yeah.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.510
Uh,rememberhen dad
would make me go hunting,

14:50.520 --> 14:52.860
and you would call with some
excuse so I could leave early?

14:52.870 --> 14:54.570
Kevin,I can barely hear you.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.670
I know.I have to be quiet.We're
just about to flush a cove

14:56.680 --> 14:58.380
are you-- are
you in a bathroom?

14:58.390 --> 14:59.300
No,no,a covey.

14:59.310 --> 15:01.320
You know,like gaggle
of geese,but for quail.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.250
Look,mom,you have to
get me out of here,okay?

15:03.260 --> 15:05.910
Sarah's in the hospital,you've
got bunions--anything.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.070
Well,I-I don't have a date
for the greenatopia party.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.710
- No,no.Come on.
- That's not an emergency.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.300
- Greenatopia?
- It's..it's..it's nothing.It's just my son.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.080
He needs an excuse
to get out of hunting.

15:15.350 --> 15:17.050
You know,it's-- it's
a good cause,honey.

15:17.060 --> 15:20.360
And,well,after all,you're
there killing wildlife.

15:20.370 --> 15:23.850
You might as well support your
sister and her eco-conscious party.

15:23.860 --> 15:25.330
No,it's not gonna work.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.030
Well,then I can't help you.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.650
You made your bed with
republicans,so lie in it.

15:29.660 --> 15:30.910
- What
- I've gotta go.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.530
Don't get shot.

15:33.610 --> 15:36.660
so when is it,this eco-conscious party?

15:36.670 --> 15:38.320
It's tonight.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.680
No.No,thank you.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.760
I just thought we
might get a few ideas...

15:40.770 --> 15:43.760
I don't need-- about
how to save costs.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.310
I'm really not sure I'm going.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.380
I have an awful headache.

15:46.390 --> 15:49.110
Oh,it's a family thing,is
it,making up excuses?

15:50.870 --> 15:52.420
Uh,shall I pick you up at 7:30?

15:52.430 --> 15:53.780
I'll meet you there.

15:53.790 --> 15:54.870
Th-this is not a date.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.290
Who said it was a date?

15:56.300 --> 15:59.200
And we'll carpool.It's greener.

16:02.070 --> 16:04.400
All right,first
rule,kevin,walk in a line.

16:04.410 --> 16:05.900
The quail will be
flushed in front of us.

16:05.910 --> 16:06.800
He's been hunting before.

16:06.810 --> 16:08.630
Well,you can't blame
us for being cautious.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.660
Best way to get an ass full of buckshot
is to walk in front of a rookie...

16:12.670 --> 16:13.670
or a liberal.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.890
sometimes the dogs will miss a covey.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.580
If that happens,we just
flush 'em ourselves.

16:16.590 --> 16:19.060
Now don't worry about
coming back empty-handed.

16:19.070 --> 16:21.540
We don't expect much.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.450
yeah.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.980
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

16:34.380 --> 16:35.410
- Hey.
- heY.

16:35.430 --> 16:36.740
Whoa.Guess you're not ready.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.120
Ugh!Running late as usual.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.540
It's just been crazy.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.540
I love the taste of guacamole.

16:43.550 --> 16:47.050
And I wanted to make it up to you,so I
planned something really special for us.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.710
Real?

16:51.010 --> 16:51.620
hold on one sec.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.560
Hello.

16:53.570 --> 16:56.000
Chelsea.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.550
Okay,uh,uh,where--
where are you?

16:59.870 --> 17:01.120
Okay,I'm gonna meet you there.

17:01.130 --> 17:03.670
All right,look,don't do
anything.I'll be right there.

17:03.930 --> 17:05.329
Okay.

17:05.589 --> 17:06.470
I'm--I'm sorry.I
have to go.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.030
Wait.Who's chelsea?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.859
Um,she's,uh,she's my sponsee.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.609
- Your sponsee,since when?
- Since last night.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.099
You know,I woulda told you,but
you're all over the place.

17:13.109 --> 17:15.540
I thought you weren't supposed to
sponsor people of the opposite sex.

17:15.550 --> 17:17.200
Look,it's temporary,all
right?She just started recovery.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.280
She doesn't know anybody else.

17:18.290 --> 17:19.990
- She knows you?
- Yeah.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.050
I'm sorry.I have to go.

17:21.060 --> 17:21.950
But what about the party?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.380
I'll meet--I'll meet
you there,all right?

17:26.790 --> 17:28.400
- you get any?
- I did.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.970
Lucky shot.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.800
I'm glad gordon
had,uh,had you join utoday.

17:32.810 --> 17:36.250
I know we haven't always
had the easiest relationship,

17:36.260 --> 17:37.500
but I respect the hell out of you,

17:37.510 --> 17:41.930
which is why I'm glad to be having
this conversation face-to-face.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.170
You're not backing me for governor.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.320
I'm afraid not.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.460
Well,um,I hope you
haven't made up your mind.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.950
There's not another
republican in the party

17:51.960 --> 17:53.710
who can put up my kind
of numbers in california.

17:53.720 --> 17:54.730
There's dick coad.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.550
Nobody outside of humboldt
county knows o he is.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.640
By the time the election
rolls around,they will.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.750
Look,dick was a ward supervisor
who worked his way up,

18:01.760 --> 18:04.060
and I know you guys
see that as party loyal,

18:04.070 --> 18:06.370
but the guy's a grunt.

18:06.380 --> 18:09.410
You say potato,I say potato.

18:09.490 --> 18:13.100
Well,I hope I get the opportunity
to make you say potato.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.910
So what number is that for you,five?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.650
Uh,no,eight.

18:17.850 --> 18:19.480
I told you,my dad was a big hunter.

18:19.490 --> 18:22.640
I remember reading that
in,uh,in kitty's book.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.260
Yeah,she talked a lot about your dad,

18:24.270 --> 18:27.090
what an influence he was on
her,political and otherwise.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.600
Yeah,he didn't have quite
the same influence on me.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.280
Clearly.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.540
What's that supposed to mean?

18:34.550 --> 18:35.550
Just making conversation.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.660
What,small,backhanded,condescending
conversation?

18:37.670 --> 18:38.720
- Kevin,what are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

18:38.730 --> 18:40.250
Since I've got here,I've
either been coddled like

18:40.260 --> 18:42.360
some half-wit or
straight-out insulted.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.150
And you wonder why
we're going with coad.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.010
Oh,okay,so I'm a crack
shot,but,you know,

18:46.020 --> 18:47.830
clearly that's not
enough to impress you.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.440
It's not enough that
I wear button-downs

18:49.450 --> 18:52.190
and eat read meat and
smoke the occasional cigar.

18:52.200 --> 18:56.080
You can't see past your own
bias to see I kicked your ass.

18:56.090 --> 18:57.650
I kicked all your
asses.So you know what?

18:57.660 --> 18:59.180
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

18:59.190 --> 18:59.930
Whoa,whoa,kevin.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.330
- Kevin!
- What?!

19:02.340 --> 19:04.180
Break the gun.

19:04.190 --> 19:06.030
Sorry.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.440
I know you're over nke pi
thing,so I didn't get you any pink.

19:12.450 --> 19:14.200
I don't like either of these.

19:14.210 --> 19:15.710
Boring,boring,boring.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.520
I wanna wear the outfit grandma bought.

19:17.530 --> 19:20.340
I'm just not comfortable with
you showing that much leg,paige.

19:20.350 --> 19:22.200
Chloe dresses like that all the time.

19:22.210 --> 19:24.470
And that may be okay
with chloe's mother.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.740
It's not okay with me.

19:25.750 --> 19:26.990
You said I could get whatever I wanted.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.170
I'm not gonna keep having
this argument,honey.

19:29.180 --> 19:32.160
End of discussion.I returned it.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.440
You returned it?!

19:33.450 --> 19:34.980
It was a sequined mini dress.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.850
It was completely inappropriate
for a girl your age.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.460
I hate you.

19:38.470 --> 19:41.880
You're never around,and then when
you are,you just ruin everything.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.290
That is not fair.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.350
I work my heart out to
take care of this family.

19:45.370 --> 19:47.140
- You're bad at it.
- Excuse me?

19:47.150 --> 19:49.690
What,you want me to look like you?

19:49.750 --> 19:50.690
I hate the way you dress.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.150
You look old and ugly all the time.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.430
Paige,stop it.

19:53.450 --> 19:56.780
No wonder dad left.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.500
there's your father.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.240
Good.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.480
We're not done with this discussion.

20:03.490 --> 20:06.120
What you just said was very
hurtful,and it's not okay.

20:06.130 --> 20:08.730
But you don't have the time,right?

20:10.000 --> 20:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:18.750 --> 20:20.250
It's an impressive party,right?

20:20.260 --> 20:23.300
Uh,yeah.If I were arlo,I'd be
taking out my checkbook right now.

20:23.310 --> 20:24.500
Nice.

20:24.630 --> 20:26.660
- Hi,guys.
- Hi.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.090
- Kyle,congratulations.
- Thank you.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.450
Ooh,greenatini?

20:29.460 --> 20:30.080
100% organic.

20:30.090 --> 20:34.390
Otherwise,I can always introduce you to
a sublime and organic walker landing red.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.380
Oh,very political of you.You know what?

20:35.390 --> 20:37.200
I am going to go see if justin's here.

20:37.210 --> 20:37.880
Okay.

20:37.890 --> 20:41.020
Uh,kyle,this is roger
grant,the architect.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.030
- Hey.Nice to meet you.
- He's designing my center.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.800
We had a few
questions that--

20:43.810 --> 20:46.470
just tell nora why she
needs to build green.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.500
Why wouldn't you build green?

20:48.510 --> 20:52.220
Well,because like the earth,my
center has limited resources--

20:52.230 --> 20:54.630
that being cash-- and
I'd like to preserve it.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.320
Yeah,but now is not
the time to cut corners.

20:56.330 --> 20:57.450
Do you know,in the U.S.

20:57.460 --> 21:00.810
,Buildings consume almost
twice as much energy as cars?

21:00.820 --> 21:01.580
I'll get you another drink.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.980
I'm gonna get you some
literature.Stay right there.

21:04.740 --> 21:07.240
before they get here,I want you
to know,I expect you to fix this.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.700
Okay,and if you don't,I'm
taking you out back,

21:08.710 --> 21:11.020
I'm gonna shoot you and tell
kitty it was a hunting accident.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.210
Robert,they're asshats.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.220
This is how we play the game,okay?

21:14.230 --> 21:15.380
This is how we get things done.

21:15.390 --> 21:18.470
And I don't care whetr they're
asshats or how they made you feel,

21:18.480 --> 21:20.010
because this isn't about you.

21:20.020 --> 21:20.830
Right?So from now on,

21:20.840 --> 21:25.760
I expect you to act like a professional
and not some insecure teenager.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.320
- Hey,guys.
- Hey.

21:28.330 --> 21:29.850
Should we eat?

21:29.860 --> 21:32.330
Let's do it.Let's eat.

21:34.450 --> 21:37.810
Finally,number one--the easiest way to make
a difference is just to avoid phantom load...

21:37.820 --> 21:38.810
- mother.
- Which is simple.

21:38.820 --> 21:39.430
- You just
- excuse me,kyle.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.190
- Would you give us a minute?
- Of course.Keep the brochure.

21:42.660 --> 21:45.260
Sarah,thank god.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.480
I have a massive headache.

21:46.490 --> 21:50.160
I just couldn't talk to that
green mussolini any longer.

21:50.170 --> 21:53.340
- You saved me.
- Well,you don't deserve saving.

21:53.350 --> 21:55.330
Thanks to you,paige hates me.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.460
You talked to her?

21:56.470 --> 21:58.970
I took the spice girl outfit back.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.850
You returned it?Oh,sarah.

22:00.860 --> 22:02.010
Oh,don't "oh,sarah" me,mother.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.270
If it wasn't for your bad judgment,I
wouldn't be in this position.

22:06.170 --> 22:09.470
You know,paige is growing up.

22:09.480 --> 22:13.060
Which makes you uncomfortable,partly
because that means you're getting older.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.170
- Oh,mother.
- You...

22:14.180 --> 22:17.130
you keep saying you don't
feel young,you don't feel hip.

22:17.140 --> 22:18.920
Mom,I was talking about this party.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.150
And you completely overreacted
to that little outfit.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.740
- Overreacted?
- Yes.Paige is going somewherewhere

22:22.750 --> 22:24.080
they may be playing spin the bottle

22:24.090 --> 22:25.800
or-- or seven
minutes in heaven.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.230
Paige isn't gonna do anything.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.030
She's not interested in sex.

22:29.040 --> 22:33.190
Sarah,this is about you and your
issues with sex and getting older.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.590
Oh,my--that
is hilarious--

22:35.600 --> 22:37.490
being lectured about the
joy of sex from someone

22:37.500 --> 22:40.250
who's clearly not engaging
with that part of her life.

22:40.260 --> 22:42.480
Sarah,I--I'm
in my 60s.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.600
Like,six months ago.

22:44.610 --> 22:45.640
- I don't know what you're
- it was a year.

22:45.650 --> 22:47.530
- You won't let any of us set you up.
- Oh,sarah.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.460
- You're refusing to try online dating...
- well,that's revolting.

22:49.470 --> 22:52.220
And it's pretty clear you're
holding back with roger.

22:52.230 --> 22:55.460
Roger is my architect.He's
not my boyfriend.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.310
My point exactly.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.070
You know,sarah,I would
think you above all people

23:00.080 --> 23:02.930
would understand just being
too busy for a social life.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.830
Mom,you're using your
cancer center as an excuse

23:05.840 --> 23:09.110
to--to--to not deal with your
romantic life or lack thereof.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.300
Let's face it--there is
a big part of your life

23:11.310 --> 23:13.290
that you are more than
comfortable to ignore.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.800
So hey,if I'm
projecting,you're in denial.

23:15.810 --> 23:18.100
Hi.There you are.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.900
- Uh,wonderful party.
- Thank you.

23:20.910 --> 23:23.680
She's all yours.Or not.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.570
What was that about?

23:26.670 --> 23:29.240
Uh...nothing.

23:30.380 --> 23:31.630
Hey,is everything okay?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.940
No,everything sucks.

23:34.230 --> 23:35.530
- Where the hell is arlo?
- I know.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.660
I was just thinking the
same thing about justin.

23:37.670 --> 23:39.160
Not only did I get us a room upgrade,

23:39.170 --> 23:40.940
but I told the front desk
that it was our anniversary

23:40.950 --> 23:43.550
and got us the honeymoon
package,and he's not even here.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.320
It's your anniversary?

23:45.330 --> 23:50.410
it's like our
8-month,4-day,2-hour anniversary.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.780
Arlo just walked in.

23:52.910 --> 23:54.550
Oh,my god.Good luck.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.380
Thanks.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.280
The site is very impressive.

24:01.290 --> 24:02.620
I see enormous potential.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.010
But you have reservations.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.150
Listen,I get it.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.600
I mean,I know that guy like you can
look at somebody like me and think

24:08.610 --> 24:11.010
,she's old,you know,she's
another generation.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.470
She doesn't facebook or twitter,and D.J.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.000
- Whatever is not even
- wait,sarah,that is not

24:15.010 --> 24:16.710
that is a good thing,because
I have experience.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.270
And I'm telling you,I have put
all my experience into greenatopia.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.460
I've ignored my
almost-teenage daughter--

24:22.470 --> 24:24.240
yes,ladies,I-I
have one--

24:24.250 --> 24:26.190
and I've had zero personal life.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.980
- Sarah,you know,maybe
- just let me finish.

24:27.990 --> 24:32.270
Arlo,I have been living in a
black hole called greenatopia.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.630
Enough!Please.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.460
If you'd let me get a word in edgewise,

24:36.470 --> 24:39.370
I would've told you,I've
already talked to my lawyers.

24:41.310 --> 24:42.340
I'm in.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.860
I want to invest.

24:43.870 --> 24:44.840
We're working up a proposal right now.

24:44.850 --> 24:47.120
I'll fax it to you in the morning.

24:47.130 --> 24:49.710
- Seriously?
- Unless you want to convince me not to.

24:49.720 --> 24:53.350
- No,no.
- Uh,no.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.190
I'm late.

24:55.640 --> 24:56.570
I'll talk to you in the morning.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.080
Thanks,arlo.Okay,in the morning.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.490
- You all right?
- Yes,I'M...

25:32.500 --> 25:33.840
I'm fine.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.590
I'm fine.

25:37.890 --> 25:40.320
oh,it's funny.

25:41.330 --> 25:45.720
I flirted with you 30 years
ago to piss my husband off

25:45.730 --> 25:49.370
and now here you are,picking
me up off the dance floor.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.210
And where's william?

25:51.220 --> 25:53.490
Nowhere around.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.590
ooh,that's enough dancing,yeah?

25:58.600 --> 25:59.760
I think I need some air.

25:59.770 --> 26:00.950
We are already outside.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.270
- Let's,um...
- oh,yeah.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.050
- Find somewhere to sit down,shall we?
- Yes.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.210
best champagne in the place.

26:14.220 --> 26:17.110
- Thank you.
- cheers.

26:17.120 --> 26:21.820
Although,it doesn't matter,because
toy is the best day of my life,

26:21.830 --> 26:24.750
and I would be happy
with just tap water.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.110
and you're happy,right?

26:26.120 --> 26:29.120
I am very happy and very relieved.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.620
Now that greenatopia is secure,

26:31.630 --> 26:34.470
I just have to face up
tohe rest of my life.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.970
Well,you helped me avoid bankruptcy.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.210
- Ybe I can help you.
- No,no.

26:38.220 --> 26:40.330
It's just,you know,what i
was saying to arlo is true.

26:40.340 --> 26:43.700
I've been this--in this
black hole of greenatopia,

26:43.710 --> 26:45.820
completely ignored the rest of my life.

26:45.830 --> 26:50.240
My daughter hates me,I haven't
been out,haven't worked out.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.590
I feel fat,old and ugly.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.000
Fat,old and ugly?

26:53.010 --> 26:54.800
Come on.

26:55.210 --> 26:57.220
You're the sexiest woman here.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.700
- Oh,stop.
- I'm serious.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.440
Do you remember when
we first met and--

27:02.450 --> 27:05.600
and I asked you who your
favorite president was?

27:05.990 --> 27:09.010
I asked you that because I didn't even
know how to talk to a woman like you.

27:09.020 --> 27:12.240
And then you said F.D.R.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.630
-
- Perfect answer.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.420
A lot of people would've said F.D.R.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.600
No,a lot of people
would've said kennedy or

27:17.610 --> 27:21.220
or reagan or would've tried to have
been quirky and said grover cleveland.

27:21.230 --> 27:23.170
I would've done that.But you said F.D.R.

27:23.180 --> 27:25.520
Because you are ridiculously smart,

27:25.530 --> 27:29.580
and yet you have no
idea how hot you are.

27:29.590 --> 27:31.250
- Ethan
- shut up and listen,

27:31.260 --> 27:35.410
because I'm on a high,and if I
don't say this now,I never will.

27:35.420 --> 27:39.860
I've been completely and utterly into
you since the moment I laid eyes on you.

27:39.870 --> 27:45.530
You are gorgeous and--and
funny and brilliant and...

27:54.510 --> 27:56.280
and a really good kisser.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.760
All right,ready?

28:10.770 --> 28:12.070
To arlo natterson.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.050
The man knows a good
idea when he sees one.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.160
Thank you.

28:15.170 --> 28:17.050
Cheers.

28:18.400 --> 28:19.090
uh,this is justin.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.240
I'm just...I'm just

28:20.250 --> 28:21.960
No,no,take it.

28:21.970 --> 28:23.020
hey,where are you?

28:23.030 --> 28:26.850
Look,rebecca,I,uh,I don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it.

28:27.090 --> 28:28.690
Are you stilwith chelsea?

28:28.700 --> 28:29.840
Yeah,she's in pretty rough shape.

28:29.850 --> 28:31.650
So,uh,I think I need totay with her.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.260
And you're working anyway,rebecca,so...

28:33.270 --> 28:34.810
yeah,working.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.010
All right.

28:36.020 --> 28:37.190
I'll see you tomorrow then.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.960
- ByE.-
Wait.Rebec--no.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.740
So he's,uh,he's not coming?

28:43.750 --> 28:45.110
Nope.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.200
I'm sorry.That sucks.

28:48.860 --> 28:51.320
He has a new sponsee,so
he can't leave her hanging.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.360
Oh,but he can leave you hanging?

28:54.160 --> 28:57.140
Look,I'm,uh,sorry to
interrupt,but,uh,nora's not feeling well.

28:57.150 --> 28:59.600
Is there a quiet place
she can sit down for a bit?

28:59.610 --> 29:00.980
Uh,yeah.I mean,not around here.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.440
But we did reserve a bunch of rooms,

29:02.450 --> 29:03.940
and you're welcome to
use one if you want to.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.740
The honeymoon suite's
available now,so that

29:05.750 --> 29:09.170
that might throw aer for loop,and
she's already quite loopy.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.410
Here's room 1215.Checkout's 11:30.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.100
Won't need it that
long,but thanks anyway.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.530
- Great party.
- thanks.

29:17.210 --> 29:19.440
You know what?I mean,he's right.

29:19.450 --> 29:22.100
This is a great party,and
we have been working nonstop.

29:22.110 --> 29:23.980
Now I say,if you want my opinion,

29:23.990 --> 29:27.980
justin or no justin,you
deserve to enjoy this.

29:28.740 --> 29:31.750
- You did get D.J.Dash.
- I did get D.J.Dash.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.130
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

29:33.150 --> 29:34.870
Really?

29:35.680 --> 29:37.800
That was a fantastic meal.

29:37.810 --> 29:38.970
Kevin seems to disagree.

29:38.980 --> 29:41.360
He hasn't touched his quail at all.

29:41.370 --> 29:43.990
Yohaven't said much either.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.220
Actually,I' been trying to
figure out a way to apologize,

29:47.230 --> 29:50.090
and I realize there's no easy way.

29:50.780 --> 29:53.470
Robert should've fired
me today,but he didn'T.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.780
And you guys are wrong about him.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.240
I understand you're gonna go with coad

29:57.250 --> 29:59.350
because he's the dependable party guy,

29:59.360 --> 30:00.600
someone you can count on,

30:00.610 --> 30:03.480
but if I'm any kind of example,

30:03.490 --> 30:05.880
you can expect the same from robert.

30:05.890 --> 30:07.480
If you help him get to
the governor's mansion,

30:07.490 --> 30:10.820
I guarantee you will get
that support returned.

30:10.830 --> 30:13.940
He will be loyal no matter
how many times you screw up.

30:13.950 --> 30:16.720
I mean,I'm not saying you'll screw up.

30:16.730 --> 30:21.150
I think the fact that I still
have my job is proof of that.

30:22.710 --> 30:24.350
I'm--I'm actually
gonna go now,

30:24.360 --> 30:29.330
because I'm starving,and quail's a
ttle too gamy for my liberal tastes.

30:29.340 --> 30:35.210
And I would imagine you've had quite enough
of me for today,so I'll say good night.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.380
I'm just gonna grab my stuff.

30:44.390 --> 30:46.190
It'll just be a second.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.460
Wow.This is amazing.

30:49.470 --> 30:50.450
Yeah.

30:50.460 --> 30:53.090
I can't believe justin
didn't show up for this.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.710
well,in h defense,he
didn't know about it.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.310
It was supposed to be a surprise.

30:59.340 --> 31:02.020
But I guess the surprise is on me.

31:02.030 --> 31:04.620
It's a pretty nice room.It'd
be a pity not to use it.

31:10.440 --> 31:12.280
kyle...

31:14.640 --> 31:16.820
I love justin.

31:16.870 --> 31:19.110
Okay.But he's an idiot.

31:22.980 --> 31:25.870
Well,hey...he's a very lucky idiot.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.590
Good night.

31:32.670 --> 31:34.600
Good night.

31:44.210 --> 31:46.230
I've been dreaming
about this since we met.

31:53.270 --> 31:55.520
- I can't do this,ethan.
- What?

31:55.530 --> 31:56.520
Oh,god.

31:56.530 --> 31:58.500
You're-- you're
my cancer center.

31:58.510 --> 31:59.900
- Your what?
- My mother

31:59.910 --> 32:02.860
I-I-I accused her of
using her cancer center

32:02.870 --> 32:06.230
as--as a way to avoid dealing
with her lack of personal life,

32:06.240 --> 32:09.140
and I think I might have
been talking about myself.

32:09.150 --> 32:10.500
I can be your
personal life,24/7--

32:10.510 --> 32:11.950
no,that wouldn't be fair to you,ethan.

32:11.960 --> 32:16.000
Listen,I came here tonight,and
I-I was feeling so...

32:16.580 --> 32:19.530
unattractive,so undesirable,

32:19.540 --> 32:24.290
and--and you said everything
that I wanted to hear.

32:24.300 --> 32:29.330
But I care about you too much
to use you to boost my own ego.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.320
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

32:32.340 --> 32:33.960
You got me out of the poorhouse,okay?

32:33.970 --> 32:36.740
You know,we have an
investor because of you.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.560
There's no reason to be sorry.

32:39.990 --> 32:42.190
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:42.210 --> 32:48.780
Good,because we still have a lot of
reasons to celebrate,and there's a minibar.

32:49.170 --> 32:54.790
And I finally have the cash to pay
for those overpriced minibar drinks.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.260
should we open some tiny little bottles?

33:00.850 --> 33:03.310
oh,roger,you're a lifesaver.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.730
This is...

33:04.740 --> 33:06.750
lovely,even though it's spinning.

33:06.760 --> 33:07.880
Bit of a lightweight,eh?

33:07.890 --> 33:09.990
No,I drink like a fish.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.170
it's just...

33:12.180 --> 33:16.600
the pills I took for--for
the headache,which...

33:16.610 --> 33:18.790
I really did have.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.410
Even though I didn't want
to come here with you.

33:23.910 --> 33:25.420
God,you're handsome.

33:25.430 --> 33:27.720
You're not so bad yourself.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.110
must be the lighting.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.960
No,no,no,and I have an
eye for these things.

33:49.310 --> 33:51.220
Nora?

33:58.720 --> 34:00.490
night-night.

34:03.990 --> 34:05.680
Yeah.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.980
Okay.

34:08.050 --> 34:10.090
All right,you,too.Thanks.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.330
they're dumping coad.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.120
Wow.Really?

34:17.130 --> 34:18.170
don't act so surprised.

34:18.179 --> 34:20.159
Look,that wasn't an angle,okay?

34:20.170 --> 34:21.280
It was a genuine apology.

34:21.290 --> 34:25.239
Well,they weren't exactly the most
inviting,and you're right,wade is an asshat.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.440
Well,no more than my dad.

34:27.980 --> 34:31.010
You know,being with those
people today,it just...

34:31.810 --> 34:33.800
reminded me of being a kid.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.889
Because dad loved to
take us hunting,you know,

34:35.900 --> 34:39.920
teaching us how to shoot and
putting us in duck blinds--

34:39.929 --> 34:42.630
everyone loved it,even sarah.

34:42.659 --> 34:44.719
And,you know,I'd try.

34:44.730 --> 34:47.889
It wasn't as if I was bad at
it.I was pretty good.It's just...

34:48.560 --> 34:51.100
he just knew I was miserable.

34:51.610 --> 34:55.440
I'd catch him sometimes,just
looking at me,staring,

34:56.130 --> 34:59.320
probably thinking,who the
hell is this wimpy kid?

34:59.340 --> 35:03.780
Well,I-I think if he was looking
down now,he'd know,you're no wi.

35:08.780 --> 35:10.820
- Wait.What if that's why I'm working for you?
- What?

35:10.830 --> 35:15.240
This is some tragically late
attempt to get my father's approval.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.850
Well,it wouldn't be the first time.

35:16.860 --> 35:19.270
It got dubya into the white house.

35:20.060 --> 35:20.880
Here-- a
celebratory cigar.

35:20.900 --> 35:24.510
Look,I don't care how you came to me.

35:24.810 --> 35:27.180
I'm just glad you're on the team.

35:28.880 --> 35:31.120
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.690
You know what this means?

35:34.700 --> 35:37.030
- I gotta tell kitty.
- Yep.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.390
-Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

35:45.870 --> 35:48.060
- mom.
- Sarah.

35:48.070 --> 35:49.460
What are you doing here?

35:49.470 --> 35:50.730
I don't know,sherlock.

35:50.740 --> 35:53.080
- What do you think?
- Oh,my god.

35:53.090 --> 35:55.090
you slept with the architect.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.420
And who were you with?

35:58.030 --> 35:59.760
- rebecca.
- Morning.

35:59.770 --> 36:02.080
Good morning to you.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.420
Justin still sleeping?

36:07.430 --> 36:09.410
Uh,I don't know where justin is.

36:09.420 --> 36:11.530
- Oh.
- Oh.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.080
rebecca,where the hell have you been?

36:16.090 --> 36:17.890
Sarah,mom,I've been
leaving messages for you.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.580
Just please tell me that
there was a slumber party.

36:20.590 --> 36:21.710
Not with each other.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.700
I just--I thought we just all
agreed not to talk about it.

36:23.710 --> 36:24.960
Okay,well,that's too bad,all right?

36:24.970 --> 36:26.950
Because I really want to
know what the hell happened,

36:26.960 --> 36:29.320
especially where you were,rebecca.

36:29.330 --> 36:31.220
- I was with kyle.
- What?

36:31.230 --> 36:32.340
No,nothing happened.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.950
You stood me up,so he
walked me back to my room,

36:33.960 --> 36:37.510
and I spent the entire night
alone in the honeymoon suite.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.490
- The honeymoon suite?
- Yeah.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.100
it was your anniversary.

36:40.110 --> 36:41.630
- What?
- No,it'S...

36:41.640 --> 36:43.280
well,I wasn't alone.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.800
Mom,I didn't ask you,all right?

36:44.810 --> 36:46.400
Oh,relax.Nothing happened.

36:46.410 --> 36:48.280
- I'm in denial.
- Oh,come on,mother.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.830
I didn't mean it.I shouldn't
have said it.I was just mad.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.930
Oh,sarah,you were right.

36:52.940 --> 36:55.670
I spent the night fully clothed,

36:55.680 --> 37:00.100
passed out next to a man
I--I'm very attracted to.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.860
That's not den that's drunk.

37:01.870 --> 37:04.740
You should know.You're the
expert.You even have a sponsee.

37:04.750 --> 37:08.500
Well,if it's any consolation,mom,I
didn't have sex either.

37:08.510 --> 37:10.070
Wait,who were you with?

37:10.080 --> 37:11.060
Ethan.

37:11.070 --> 37:12.490
We were just celebrating.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.000
- You got an investor?
- Yeah.

37:14.010 --> 37:14.890
All right.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.360
Which you would know
if you would've come.

37:16.370 --> 37:17.690
- Can I talk to you for a second,please?
- Yeah.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.850
Oh,sarah,I'm so happy for you.

37:19.860 --> 37:22.290
- It's a great relief.
- I'm happy for greenatopia.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.860
Thank you.

37:23.870 --> 37:26.620
But you were right about me,too.

37:26.630 --> 37:30.900
I have a daughter who is moving
forward to the next stage of her life.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.950
She has it all ahead of her.

37:32.960 --> 37:37.940
And,you know,I--I'm feeling
like my best days are behind me.

37:38.410 --> 37:40.630
Your best days are not behind you.

37:40.650 --> 37:41.940
Yofeel likeyour ship has sailed.

37:41.950 --> 37:44.410
I feel like my ship has sunk.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.120
what should we do?

37:49.130 --> 37:51.200
Let's start by going home.

37:51.210 --> 37:53.040
Good idea.

37:53.050 --> 37:54.890
I mean,the honeymoon
suite?You should've told me.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.600
Well,it was a surprise.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.650
- I'm sorry,okay?-
You--you should be.

37:59.060 --> 38:01.340
Justin,we've barely seen each other
lately,and last night was a big deal.

38:01.350 --> 38:02.900
To not show up because of a sponsee?

38:02.910 --> 38:04.710
- She needed me,rebecca.
- I needed you.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.020
No,you didn'T.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.180
The party was a huge success.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.430
Your life is a huge success.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.120
You didn't need my help.

38:10.140 --> 38:13.550
Okay?And honestly,for the first
time,last night,somebody actually did.

38:14.950 --> 38:15.960
Well,yeah,okay,fine.

38:15.970 --> 38:17.710
Last night was a success.

38:17.720 --> 38:21.430
But,justin,when you're not
there,nothing means as much.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.480
Do you understand
that?I do need you,a L.

38:26.140 --> 38:29.200
Well,maybe it's nice to
hear it once in a while.

38:30.650 --> 38:32.360
Well,I do.

38:32.380 --> 38:34.670
Well,I do,too.

38:40.060 --> 38:44.230
- I haven't checked out yet.
- Really?

38:45.850 --> 38:47.810
And I have the whole day off.

38:49.300 --> 38:51.140
the whole day...

38:52.030 --> 38:53.540
we should go.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.400
Now I know that you're angry,

38:56.410 --> 39:01.440
but there are some things that are
difficult for me to compromise on.

39:01.660 --> 39:03.930
So I don't even get a say?

39:03.940 --> 39:05.870
No,sometimes you will.

39:05.880 --> 39:09.700
But there will be times when you
won't understand why I'm saying no,

39:09.710 --> 39:11.160
but you still have to do what I say,

39:11.170 --> 39:15.640
because I'm your mother,and
I have that right.

39:16.840 --> 39:22.140
But what if the other kids make fun
of me and say that I dress like a baby?

39:23.190 --> 39:26.840
listen,I know it'S...it's
difficult for you,too.

39:26.850 --> 39:28.880
Okay?I really do.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.870
That's why...

39:33.310 --> 39:36.300
I went back to the store.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.380
the outfit!

39:41.390 --> 39:46.660
Yes,and I got this cute little jacket
and some leggings to go with it.

39:46.670 --> 39:50.070
The whole outfit will be
even cuter,and you'll be rm.

39:50.810 --> 39:53.840
And you still get to wear
what you wanted to wear.

39:55.130 --> 39:56.770
Thank you,mom.

39:59.550 --> 40:01.030
come here.

40:03.170 --> 40:04.790
come here,my little chicken.

40:04.810 --> 40:09.080
Now you have your whole life to be old.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.750
You don't have to be in such a rush.

40:11.940 --> 40:13.600
Okay?

40:13.610 --> 40:16.730
Why don't you be my little
girl just a little while longer?

40:18.630 --> 40:20.370
Ttle chicken.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.600
oh,god.

40:26.610 --> 40:28.320
Roger,I was hoping that wasn't you.

40:28.330 --> 40:31.270
Clearly,since you
snuck out this morning.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.580
Here.

40:32.590 --> 40:34.640
I'm--I was gonna
leave a new estimate.

40:34.650 --> 40:36.150
I think you'll find it more reasonable,

40:36.160 --> 40:40.030
although,no more,uh,dual
flushing toilets.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.730
Thank you.

40:41.770 --> 40:46.280
God,I'm so embarrassed about last
night,and then I just ran away.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.110
You--you don't need
to explain to me.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.380
Yes,I do.

40:50.980 --> 40:53.830
Roger,you make me nervous.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.970
I don't know why.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.060
When I met you 30 years
ago,you made me nervous,

40:57.070 --> 41:00.500
and 30 yearsgo,I was 30 years younger.

41:00.510 --> 41:02.820
Nora,we've got older.

41:02.830 --> 41:05.960
My god,why you think I
keep pushing all this...

41:05.970 --> 41:07.900
eco-material?

41:07.910 --> 41:11.900
Because I'm competing against these
little wunderkinds straight out of school.

41:11.910 --> 41:14.770
I'm struggling to stay relevant.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.270
- Really?
- Yes.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.060
I wish you'd kissed me 30 years ago.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.610
What about now?

41:26.980 --> 41:30.980
