00:40.634 --> 00:42.236
(screeches)

00:49.245 --> 00:53.287
Pascal, is there anything
better than the sun on your face

00:53.374 --> 00:55.682
and the wind blowing
through your hair?

00:55.769 --> 00:59.164
- (squeaks)
- Well, blowing through your scales?

01:03.285 --> 01:05.889
You know, I gotta admit,
when I saw the Black Rock trail

01:05.976 --> 01:07.500
was leading us across the water,

01:07.587 --> 01:10.838
I had my doubts about converting
the caravan into a boat.

01:10.925 --> 01:14.451
- (thunder crashes)
- And... as it turns out,

01:14.538 --> 01:17.273
those doubts were not
completely unfounded.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.690
(thunder cracking)

01:20.777 --> 01:22.715
(squeaking)

01:24.285 --> 01:25.980
(loud clanging)

01:26.067 --> 01:27.615
Storm!

01:30.968 --> 01:33.118
- (grunting)
- Don't worry!

01:33.328 --> 01:36.308
According to my calculations,
we should just miss it.

01:36.395 --> 01:38.077
RAPUNZEL:
Whoa!

01:38.164 --> 01:39.807
When will you people

01:39.894 --> 01:42.943
learn to ignore
the things I say?

01:43.030 --> 01:44.354
(thunder crashes)

01:44.441 --> 01:49.342
Listen up! The most important
thing is to remain calm

01:49.429 --> 01:51.736
Really? I would've thought
the most important thing

01:51.823 --> 01:53.427
to do would be
to not drown!

01:53.514 --> 01:55.858
(yelling, shrieking)

01:55.945 --> 01:58.280
RAPUNZEL: Eugene,
Lance, grab the helm.

01:58.367 --> 02:01.291
We need to hit those waves
at a 45-degree angle.

02:01.378 --> 02:03.462
Cass, Foot, empty the bilge.

02:03.549 --> 02:06.916
Max and Fidella, help me get
everything on deck tied down.

02:07.003 --> 02:08.595
- And Pascal?
- (squeaks)

02:08.681 --> 02:11.320
Um, you'd better get below deck
and ride this out.

Pascal! Oh, you're okay.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.657
You scared me.

02:50.744 --> 02:53.784
You should have never tried
to fix that jib on your own.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.017
Well, gang, I've got bad news...

02:59.104 --> 03:00.329
and really bad news.

03:00.416 --> 03:01.989
We strayed
from the Black Rock path

03:02.076 --> 03:04.103
and our caravan is now kaput.

03:04.190 --> 03:06.448
Wait. So we're stuck here?

03:06.535 --> 03:08.107
I don't wanna be stuck here.

03:08.194 --> 03:09.807
No one wants to be
stuck here.

03:09.894 --> 03:11.181
Where is here?

03:11.268 --> 03:15.126
Tirapai Island, an agricultural
port known for its bountiful fruit.

03:15.213 --> 03:18.049
The waning of the moon sharpens
the sweetness of the crop,

03:18.136 --> 03:20.854
making the new moon
an optimal time to harvest.

03:20.941 --> 03:25.017
A cargo ferry arrives to bring the island's
fruit to the mainland each new moon.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.526
How do you possibly
know all that?

03:27.613 --> 03:28.927
I know things.

03:29.014 --> 03:31.299
Plus, it says it
on that plaque over there.

03:31.386 --> 03:32.988
EUGENE:
Ah, plaque, yes.

03:33.075 --> 03:36.986
Sounds like all we got to do is wait to
catch the ferry at the next new moon.

03:37.073 --> 03:38.443
Ugh. This is horrible.

03:38.530 --> 03:41.162
We could be here for days
or months... or even...

03:41.249 --> 03:44.330
Look, I know it's not ideal,
but if we have to be stranded,

03:44.417 --> 03:46.757
at least it's
in a beautiful place like this.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.849
And if we are stuck here,

03:49.936 --> 03:51.968
we're gonna need
to make shelter.

03:52.195 --> 03:55.689
What do you say we have a little, uh,
shelter building contest, right?

03:55.776 --> 03:57.373
Cass and I
versus you guys?

03:57.460 --> 04:00.263
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's four of us and two of you.

04:00.350 --> 04:01.637
I mean, is that really fair?

04:01.724 --> 04:04.471
For the record, it is not
two against four.

04:04.539 --> 04:06.843
- (squeaks)
- We've also got Max.

04:07.325 --> 04:09.717

Oh, wait, wait, wait...

Yes! (laughs)
Doesn't he look so cute?

Mm, cute's not really
my thing.

12:33.224 --> 12:37.652
of things, you would see that there's
all this delicious, exotic fruit

12:37.739 --> 12:39.087
right in front us.

12:44.107 --> 12:47.533
You know what?
I'm gonna go talk to him.

12:48.405 --> 12:51.998
Oh. Oh, wow.
Oh, this...

12:52.157 --> 12:54.486
fruit is kinda...
(moans)

12:54.573 --> 12:56.299
Kinda what, Raps?

12:56.386 --> 12:57.986
(moans) Nothin'.

12:58.073 --> 13:01.318
It's, um... it's just, uh...

13:01.405 --> 13:03.603
- Uh...
- I'm sorry. Just, what?

13:03.690 --> 13:07.092
It's, uh... it's delicious.

13:07.179 --> 13:08.335
- Really?
- Mmm!

13:08.422 --> 13:10.656
Then, here.
Maybe you'd like to try

13:10.743 --> 13:13.970
some more delicious,
exotic fruit.

13:14.201 --> 13:15.790
(screams)

13:17.155 --> 13:19.198
(screaming)

13:19.285 --> 13:20.658
(grunts, groans)

13:20.745 --> 13:25.097
These are some really
silly freinfloofers you adopted.

13:26.035 --> 13:28.028
Ah, wow.

13:28.199 --> 13:31.129
These stinky weeds
are refreshing.

13:31.905 --> 13:34.627
Pascal, this has to stop.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.696
Tell them we're not your pets.
Tell them we're your friends.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.387
Surely, Lizardus
would never consider

13:40.474 --> 13:43.045
such boorish creatures friends?

13:43.132 --> 13:46.009
Pascal, this isn't you.

13:46.096 --> 13:50.130
Huh? Where's my generous,
kindhearted little buddy?

13:50.217 --> 13:51.848
Little? (laughs)

13:52.363 --> 13:54.026
Oh, funny joke!

13:54.113 --> 13:57.272
Lizardus Rex is anything
but little!

13:57.359 --> 14:00.385
Lizardus possesses
mighty power!

14:00.472 --> 14:02.205
These pets are the pits!

14:02.292 --> 14:05.217
Send these freinfloofers
away, and come with us!

14:05.304 --> 14:08.441
We have prepared
many giftings for you!

14:08.528 --> 14:14.301
It is he who is large
and you who are puny!

14:18.599 --> 14:21.557
So that's why
you've been acting...

14:21.644 --> 14:24.738
Oh. I've been treating him
like he was...

14:25.206 --> 14:27.957
Wait, Pascal, I get it!

14:31.824 --> 14:33.610
EUGENE: Looks good.
But I'm thinking,

14:33.697 --> 14:35.744
if we really wanted
to avoid the anthills,

14:35.831 --> 14:37.404
we should've built
a tree house.

14:37.491 --> 14:39.528
Oh, well, I'll be!

14:39.615 --> 14:43.755
Oh, come on, guys! What have we
discussed about Shorty and tools?

14:47.325 --> 14:49.784
SHORTY:
Tree, meet house.

14:55.285 --> 15:01.760
And now, our hero, Lizardus Rex,
will defeat our enemy, the Firefly.

15:01.847 --> 15:04.741
(cheering)

15:04.914 --> 15:10.108
We bestow unto you
the Mighty Staff of Cupon.

15:10.195 --> 15:15.858
And decorate you with
the stinky weeds of Lorbwalla.

15:15.945 --> 15:20.206
(Lorbs chanting)
Lizardus! Lizardus! Lizardus!

15:21.785 --> 15:24.775
I can't believe
I couldn't see it before.

15:24.862 --> 15:26.724
We were making him
feel left out.

15:26.811 --> 15:29.337
I was making him feel
left out.

15:29.424 --> 15:32.579
I was treating him
like he was this big.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.107
In your defense,
he is that big.

15:35.194 --> 15:36.424
Not to me.

15:36.541 --> 15:39.060
(sighs)
I have to go apologize.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.194
(buzzing)

15:41.079 --> 15:42.238
Uh, Cass?

15:42.362 --> 15:44.415
I think that's
the Firefly.

15:44.502 --> 15:46.068
- (buzzing)
- No way!

15:46.155 --> 15:48.326
Yeah!
We have to warn Pascal!

15:48.413 --> 15:52.963
- (Lorb screams)
- You will warn him of nothing!

15:57.580 --> 16:00.950
FLORINA: We will finally have
a fruitful pompoen season

16:01.037 --> 16:04.635
without the Firefly
ruining it! Oh!

16:10.728 --> 16:16.166
We have never been this close, but
with you, Master, we have no fear.

16:20.655 --> 16:25.190
ALFONS:
Behold! The Firefly!

16:25.605 --> 16:28.685
It is time!
Morph into your attack form!

16:28.772 --> 16:31.283
Use your fearsome
machtshovel!

16:32.985 --> 16:34.650
Is he stretching?

16:34.737 --> 16:36.012
What is this?

16:36.099 --> 16:39.296
(yelling)

16:40.413 --> 16:41.718
Is this a joke?

16:41.865 --> 16:43.671
- (Lorbs screaming)
- Yeah! You really think

16:43.758 --> 16:47.345
this cute little net is gonna restrain us
and a 1,200-pound horse?

16:47.432 --> 16:49.271
Come on!
We have to save Pascal

16:49.358 --> 16:51.319
before he gets hurt
by the Firefly.

16:52.030 --> 16:55.658
Look at this place!
High ceilings, open spaces,

16:55.745 --> 16:59.084
my favorite selling point,
no terrifying insects.

16:59.171 --> 17:01.994
And the best part is,
I just found this place!

17:02.081 --> 17:03.217
Just sitting here!

17:03.304 --> 17:05.002
Lance, this is
the girls' place, isn't it?

17:05.089 --> 17:07.278
Yes, and I found it.

17:07.365 --> 17:08.826
Just sitting here.

17:08.913 --> 17:10.505
(screaming)

17:32.035 --> 17:33.115
(shrieks)

17:34.871 --> 17:38.702
Pascal!
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

17:38.789 --> 17:42.930
I am sorry if I made you
feel small and unneeded.

17:52.365 --> 17:55.376
Uh, guys!
Flying monster, remember?

17:58.196 --> 18:01.875
Master, what is the problem?

18:06.785 --> 18:09.058
Pascal is not a warrior king.

18:09.145 --> 18:11.718
He doesn't have an attack form.

18:11.805 --> 18:12.984
He is a chameleon.

18:13.071 --> 18:14.727
And he would've told you sooner,

18:14.814 --> 18:17.398
but he just...
He got carried away

18:17.485 --> 18:19.219
with all of the attention.

18:19.547 --> 18:22.610
Which he wouldn't have needed,
if his real friends

18:22.697 --> 18:25.618
had been giving him
the credit that he deserves.

18:27.032 --> 18:30.446
Well, we can't say
we fully understand,

18:30.533 --> 18:33.116
but we can definitely say,

18:33.203 --> 18:37.480
this is incredibly
bad timing on your part,

18:37.567 --> 18:39.891
you crazy freinfloofer!

18:43.878 --> 18:46.678
So, uh, where are
the ladies, anyway?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.222
EUGENE:
I think I know where they are.

18:55.825 --> 18:59.905
Cass! Max! Let's lure him
away from the village!

19:05.405 --> 19:08.491
RAPUNZEL:
Hey! Over here!

19:12.155 --> 19:14.005
(Lorbs screaming)

19:16.405 --> 19:18.039
Okay, let's take inventory.

19:18.126 --> 19:21.398
Giant bug monster, check. Little
leafy people and Pascal in a cape.

19:21.485 --> 19:24.116
Double check. (chuckles)
I cannot wait to hear this story.

19:24.203 --> 19:25.180
Hey, whoa!

19:25.267 --> 19:27.045
(Lorbs screaming)

19:28.985 --> 19:30.698
Yah!

19:30.785 --> 19:33.519
Hey, Blondie! Looks like
you made some new friends!

19:33.606 --> 19:36.422
You know me,
never met a stranger.

19:38.985 --> 19:40.285
(yelling)

19:41.615 --> 19:43.278
Aah.

19:43.365 --> 19:44.858
Aah!

19:44.945 --> 19:46.035
(hisses)

19:47.035 --> 19:48.484
(grunting)

19:48.571 --> 19:49.785
(growls)

19:50.905 --> 19:51.945
(grunts)

19:54.985 --> 19:57.823
- Rapunzel!
- What are we gonna do?

19:57.910 --> 20:00.090
There's no stopping this thing!

20:06.195 --> 20:09.404
Peppers.
Mouth on fire.

20:09.491 --> 20:12.072
(gasps) Wait!
It's not evil!

20:12.159 --> 20:14.400
It's just eating
too many peppers!

20:14.487 --> 20:17.005
That's some really
bad indigestion.

20:22.155 --> 20:25.709
We just have to feed it
these stinky weeds!

20:25.796 --> 20:28.976
Okay! I don't know what
that means, but let's do it!

20:41.155 --> 20:42.429
Pascal!

20:52.012 --> 20:53.530
No!

20:53.655 --> 20:55.593
(growls)

21:00.985 --> 21:03.285
(roaring)

21:06.745 --> 21:09.007
Pascal?

21:09.325 --> 21:10.913
(squeaks)

21:11.245 --> 21:12.484
Pascal!

21:12.656 --> 21:17.522
Oh! You are, by far,
the bravest chameleon

21:17.609 --> 21:19.664
I have ever met,
and I will never, ever,

21:19.751 --> 21:22.642
ever overlook your inner
strength and courage.

21:22.745 --> 21:24.252
Or your quick thinking.

21:24.339 --> 21:26.898
(Lorbs cheering)

21:26.985 --> 21:29.165
ALFONS:
Yes! He is brilliant!

21:29.252 --> 21:32.821
The Firefly only had an upset
tum-tum from the peppers!

21:32.908 --> 21:36.232
All we must do is supply him
with those stinky weeds

21:36.319 --> 21:38.620
and our harvest is saved!

21:38.707 --> 21:43.518
We have lost a king,
but we have gained a friend.

21:47.155 --> 21:49.924
Well, as far as the shelter
building contest goes,

21:50.011 --> 21:51.862
I think you ladies win.

21:51.949 --> 21:54.454
What's wrong
with your shelter?

21:54.541 --> 21:59.098
Well, let's just say that it...
kinda got away from us.
