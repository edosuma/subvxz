00:00.935 --> 00:02.435
              Daly:             
   Last night on "the voice"... 

00:02.437 --> 00:04.337
     ¶ ...Hands ¶               

00:04.339 --> 00:06.439
¶ they'll never love you        
like i can, can, can ¶          

00:06.441 --> 00:08.041
              ¶ no, no,         
      they will never love you ¶

00:08.042 --> 00:09.375
     ...The battles began...    

00:09.377 --> 00:11.844
       Pharrell: The battle     
      performances are epic.    

00:11.846 --> 00:16.181
      The bar was lifted to     
   a new, unmeasurable height.  

00:16.184 --> 00:17.984
              Daly:             
      That's how you battle!    

00:17.986 --> 00:19.519
   ...Blowing our coaches away. 

00:19.521 --> 00:20.853
              That was so good! 

00:20.855 --> 00:22.522
                I feel like     
           we're at the grammys.

00:22.524 --> 00:23.823
                    Whoo!       

00:23.825 --> 00:26.259
   That was my favorite battle  
       that i've ever seen.     

00:26.261 --> 00:27.093
              Ellie.            

00:27.095 --> 00:28.728
    ¶ this is my fight song ¶   

00:28.730 --> 00:30.363
    Daly: Winners were picked.  

00:30.365 --> 00:33.399
             Jordan:            
   I'm really excited that adam 
     does see something in me   

00:33.401 --> 00:34.701
      That i don't even see     
           myself yet.          

00:34.703 --> 00:36.169
              James!            

00:36.171 --> 00:38.104
We're finding that everyone has 
a really good chance of winning.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.906
               You're awesome!  

00:39.908 --> 00:42.208
    And watching them blossom,  
   like, right before your eyes 

00:42.210 --> 00:43.276
       Is really rewarding.     

00:43.278 --> 00:44.978
    I think they're all ready   
         to make records.       

00:44.980 --> 00:46.612
           It's crazy.          

00:46.614 --> 00:47.714
  There is a steal!             

00:47.716 --> 00:49.849
              Daly:             
    And with two steals each,   

00:49.851 --> 00:53.419
Our coaches gave a deserving few
    new life on a new team.     

00:53.421 --> 00:54.287
                     Yes!       

00:54.289 --> 00:56.789
                You deserve     
            to be on this show. 

00:56.791 --> 01:00.960
  Daly: Adam, gwen, and pharrell
       each used one steal,     

01:00.962 --> 01:02.862
    Strengthening their teams.  

01:02.864 --> 01:04.197
 But blake has been holding out.

01:04.199 --> 01:05.965
              Blake:            
 I still have both of my steals.

01:05.967 --> 01:08.668
  I'm just looking for somebody 
    that fits in with my team   

01:08.670 --> 01:10.770
      That doesn't interfere    
        with anybody else.      

01:10.772 --> 01:12.505
              Daly:             
   Give it up for your coaches! 

01:12.507 --> 01:15.708
  Tonight, the battles continue.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.410
                    Yeah!       

01:17.412 --> 01:20.747
 And to help prepare their teams
  for the fight of their lives, 

01:20.749 --> 01:24.183
 Our coaches have enlisted some 
of the biggest names in music...

01:30.625 --> 01:32.658
            I recorded this song
                 in my key,     

01:32.660 --> 01:34.160
               So i think       
       we're gonna have to write

01:34.162 --> 01:35.461
        A different melody or...

01:35.463 --> 01:37.463
        They'll challenge       
          their teams...        

01:37.465 --> 01:39.265
You got to go out there         
and just give it hell.          

01:39.267 --> 01:41.000
   ...And put them to the test. 

01:41.002 --> 01:42.368
You have to be explosive.       

01:42.370 --> 01:44.003
           Block everything out.

01:44.005 --> 01:46.672
      You have to give 100%     
      because it's a battle.    

01:46.674 --> 01:48.674
     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:48.676 --> 01:51.744

01:51.746 --> 01:54.380
 ¶ it's only teenage wasteland ¶

01:54.382 --> 01:55.515
        Yeah!                   

01:55.517 --> 01:57.483
           It was like          
   you were let out of a cage.  

01:57.485 --> 02:00.086
       That was the best battle 
     we've ever had on the show.

02:00.088 --> 02:01.921
         You could make an album
                right now.      

02:01.923 --> 02:03.456
    Daly: With steals in play,  

02:03.458 --> 02:06.192
      Our coaches will fight    
  to get the artists they want. 

02:06.194 --> 02:07.493
   You're so dumb.              

02:07.495 --> 02:08.494
              Yeah!             

02:08.496 --> 02:09.529
Let's just get real here.       

02:09.531 --> 02:11.130
      Obviously,                
you're gonna be on my team.     

02:11.132 --> 02:12.632
          This is a good battle.
  Yeah!                         

02:12.634 --> 02:15.001
          Isn't howie mandel    
      on "america's got talent"?

02:15.003 --> 02:16.402
           Why are you even here
                 right now?     

02:16.404 --> 02:19.672
              Daly:             
    It all starts...Right now.  

02:19.674 --> 02:21.174

   It's night 2 of the battles  
 at universal studios hollywood.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.712
         Wow!                   

02:30.251 --> 02:32.618
        While our coaches       
      head to their chairs,     

02:32.620 --> 02:34.887

02:37.225 --> 02:39.592
        Got his team ready      
         for the battles.       

02:39.594 --> 02:41.527
You're one of the founding      
fathers of rock 'n' roll.       

02:41.529 --> 02:43.529
                     Thank you. 
You inspired all of us.         

02:43.531 --> 02:44.964
                 I'm stoked.    

02:44.966 --> 02:47.967

  battle pairing of the night...

     from chicago, illinois,    

02:52.240 --> 02:57.276
  Versus 45-year-old manny cabo 
   from elizabeth, new jersey.  

02:57.278 --> 02:58.678
        Mwah!                   

02:58.680 --> 03:02.048
   Irish rocker and family man  
   keith semple came to america 

03:02.050 --> 03:03.716
   Hoping to get his big break. 

03:03.718 --> 03:08.554
   I want to be the good father 
  by day and rock star by night.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.423

  His incredible blind audition 

03:12.260 --> 03:14.460
       Caught the attention     
      of both adam and gwen.    

03:14.462 --> 03:15.862
     I don't have               
   any irish in me.

                    I do!       

03:17.065 --> 03:18.498
   I think you got              
a really powerful voice.        

03:18.500 --> 03:19.765
       I think                  
you belong on my team.          

03:19.767 --> 03:21.467
       I'm gonna have to go     
            with adam.

 ¶ here i go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o ¶

03:43.358 --> 03:47.093
      Your voice just kept going
      into different dimensions.

03:47.095 --> 03:48.461
Adam: And you brought me        
      to a place                

03:48.463 --> 03:50.429
 That is the roots of           
where everything started for me.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.230
 Man, do i want you.

  our adviser was john fogerty, 

03:59.741 --> 04:02.175
    I lost the power of speech  
        for a few seconds.      

04:02.177 --> 04:03.176
           [ chuckles ]

       Keith: I've grown up     
        listening to ccr.       

04:10.018 --> 04:12.118
       I am such a big fan.     

04:12.120 --> 04:14.153
      Adam: I couldn't avoid    
     putting you two together   

04:14.155 --> 04:16.289
  'cause you really do represent
          rock 'n' roll.

  And you guys know this one -- 
    "baba o'riley" by the who.  

04:18.892 --> 04:20.026
                      Yeah.     
Yeah. Who doesn't?              

04:20.028 --> 04:21.060
I love this song.               

04:21.062 --> 04:22.862
There's a theatrical quality    
to it                           

04:22.864 --> 04:24.997
That really plays to, like,     
a rock 'n' roll singer.         

04:24.999 --> 04:26.132
"baba o'riley" is about         

04:26.134 --> 04:28.868
As soaring into the stratosphere
as it gets.

               into my living ¶ 

04:41.583 --> 04:42.882
           Keith's got          
      a really unique sound.    

04:42.884 --> 04:45.484
      With the personality,     
   they're both real powerful.  

04:45.486 --> 04:47.687
¶ i don't need to fight ¶       

04:47.689 --> 04:50.156

       There's a big note       
        that goes way up.       
      Yeah.                     

04:55.430 --> 04:58.030
You can kind of screech it      
like -- kkkt -- get raspy there.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.332
      Doesn't have to be        
      so perfect.               

04:59.334 --> 05:02.268
I've never really taken         
vocal lessons, so i'm a sponge. 

05:02.270 --> 05:03.569
   It was a little challenging. 

05:03.571 --> 05:05.838
     The first line i have is   
  the highest part of the song. 

05:05.840 --> 05:07.506
    I got a little bit of work  
              to do.

              Yeah.             

05:13.481 --> 05:15.581
  The hardest part about singing
    "baba o'riley" is the fact  

05:15.583 --> 05:18.951
    That everybody's gonna be   
 comparing you to roger daltrey.

05:18.953 --> 05:21.287
       You have to sing it      
 with as much passion as he did.

05:21.289 --> 05:23.723
       Sing it super-irish.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.982
     Manny, you just really know
     what you're doing,         

11:56.984 --> 11:58.984
     And it just feels          
     so natural for you.        

11:58.986 --> 12:03.389
 And, keith, there was moments  
 where my breath was taken away.

12:03.391 --> 12:05.424
     It was like                
     you were let out of a cage.

12:05.426 --> 12:06.825
     You need to make a record. 

12:06.827 --> 12:09.061
    You are such a natural star.

12:09.063 --> 12:10.229
     I would have to say keith. 

12:10.231 --> 12:11.630
     [ cheers and applause ]    
           daly: Adam.          

12:11.632 --> 12:14.233
  It really felt like it was    
  steps later in the competition

12:14.235 --> 12:15.734
 Because it was really polished.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.904
 Manny, you have this infectious
 way of taking full ownership,  

12:18.906 --> 12:21.206
         And that's really tough
         for someone like keith 

12:21.208 --> 12:23.475
           And intimidating     
           to keep up with.     

12:23.477 --> 12:24.777
     It was like a tennis match.

12:24.779 --> 12:26.879
  I couldn't decide who to      
  bounce back and forth between.

12:26.881 --> 12:29.314
      The presence was that felt
      on both ends.             

12:29.316 --> 12:30.683
          Adam, who's the winner
          of this battle?       

12:30.685 --> 12:32.217
           [ audience shouting ]

12:32.219 --> 12:34.353
           Uh...                

12:34.355 --> 12:36.588
           I love you guys.     

12:36.590 --> 12:38.390
           Uh...                

12:42.196 --> 12:43.529
    The winner of this battle...

12:43.531 --> 12:44.630
           Is keith.            

12:44.632 --> 12:47.032
          Keith moves on        
     to the knockout rounds!    

12:47.034 --> 12:49.702
         Congratulations!       

12:49.704 --> 12:51.704
        Whoo!                   

12:51.706 --> 12:53.372
     Cheer daddy!               

12:53.374 --> 12:56.942
              Adam:             
  Keith and manny were awesome. 

12:56.944 --> 12:58.510
          But as far as         
       the singing prowess,     

12:58.512 --> 13:00.312
    Keith has a very beautiful  
          high register,        

13:00.314 --> 13:01.380
    And it's very effortless.   

13:01.382 --> 13:02.881
  The sky's the limit with him. 

13:02.883 --> 13:04.316
        He can go very far      
       in this competition.     

13:04.318 --> 13:06.518
                      Yay!      
       Mwah!                    

13:06.520 --> 13:07.953
   Keith:                       
   Adam's had the kind of career

13:07.955 --> 13:10.089
       That i have              
       always wanted to have,   

13:10.091 --> 13:13.292
 And maybe with his expertise,  
 i've got the chance to do that.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.060
       Fingers crossed.         

13:15.062 --> 13:16.395
 All right, coaches,            
 want to let you know           

13:16.397 --> 13:17.930
That manny is available         
      to steal.                 

13:17.932 --> 13:20.099
        Manny,                  
anything you want to say?       

13:20.101 --> 13:22.534
    I'm just completely grateful
      for this entire journey,  

13:22.536 --> 13:25.370
     And i feel that the journey
           has to continue.     

13:25.372 --> 13:26.371

              Thank you, buddy. 

13:32.480 --> 13:33.979
              Gwen:             
   I only have one steal left,  

13:33.981 --> 13:36.381
        And i have my eye       
      on some other people.     

13:36.383 --> 13:37.549
                  So good.      
       Thank you.               

13:37.551 --> 13:39.418
    So i didn't press my button.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.987
  Keith is a crazy lead vocalist
          for this era.         

13:41.989 --> 13:43.388
          He's amazing.         

13:43.390 --> 13:44.623
 I want him to sing,            
   like, some muse.             

13:44.625 --> 13:45.624
             Mm-hmm.            

13:45.626 --> 13:47.025
       Daly: Still to come,

   One artist gets our coaches  
   into a battle of their own.  

13:50.331 --> 13:52.664
      I would plug into you     
  and download everything i did.

Blake doesn't even have         
     the internet.              

13:54.034 --> 13:55.234
 He's from oklahoma.            

13:55.236 --> 13:57.636
          Isn't howie mandel    
      on "america's got talent"?

13:57.638 --> 13:59.171
           Why are you even here
                 right now?     

13:59.173 --> 14:00.572
           [ laughter ]         

14:02.276 --> 14:03.575

    your kohl's style insider,  

14:06.080 --> 14:07.679
 Coming to you from the battles,

14:07.681 --> 14:10.249
    Where we're seeing artists  
      suiting up in jackets.    

14:10.251 --> 14:13.352
While keith semple rocked it out
      in a velour blazer,       

14:13.354 --> 14:15.420
           Last night,          
 zach seabaugh topped things off

14:15.422 --> 14:16.822
      With a tailored style,    

14:16.824 --> 14:19.992
      And dustin christensen    
 got soulful in dark wash denim.

14:19.994 --> 14:22.127
   The jackets really completed 
           their looks,         

14:22.129 --> 14:25.030
           So tonight,          
 i'm taking a cue from the guys.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.199
        To shop my blazer       
     and other bold jackets,    

14:27.201 --> 14:29.735
       Go to nbc.Com/kohls.     

14:29.737 --> 14:32.371
       And follow me online     
    for more "voice" fashion.   

14:38.745 --> 14:40.078
     ¶ this is "the voice" ¶    

14:40.080 --> 14:41.914
       Daly: Welcome back.      

14:41.916 --> 14:44.316
     Let's head over to blake   
         and his adviser,       

14:44.318 --> 14:47.953
   Three-time grammy winner and 
 country superstar brad paisley.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.989
¶ well, everybody'd like        
 to have what i got ¶           

14:50.991 --> 14:54.092
      ¶ i can cool 'em down     
  when they're smoldering hot ¶ 

14:54.094 --> 14:56.361
   Blake: If you know anything  
       about country music,     

14:56.363 --> 14:57.696
  You know who brad paisley is. 

14:57.698 --> 14:59.598
         He was actually        
     kind of a mentor for me.   

14:59.600 --> 15:01.300
    I learned a lot from him,   
            and i know          

15:01.302 --> 15:03.869
He's gonna pass that information
   along to these kids, too.    

15:03.871 --> 15:05.537
           That was great, guys.
 That was fun.                  

15:05.539 --> 15:07.339
Daly:                           
Let's look at blake's matchup --

15:07.341 --> 15:10.742
     31-year-old chris crump    
       from baytown, texas,     

15:10.744 --> 15:15.480
Versus 22-year-old krista hughes
 from coal city, west virginia. 

15:15.482 --> 15:18.183
       Newlywed chris crump     
       came to "the voice"      

15:18.185 --> 15:20.185
   Hoping to secure his future. 

15:20.187 --> 15:22.821
  Chris: It's not just my career
       that's on the line.      

15:22.823 --> 15:24.423
    I want to support my wife.  

15:24.425 --> 15:26.058
        ¶ so, baby, now ¶       

15:26.060 --> 15:28.660
             Daly:              
  During the blind auditions,   
his version of an ed sheeran hit

15:28.662 --> 15:30.662
        Got the attention       
       of all four coaches.     

15:30.664 --> 15:33.298
          ¶ take me into        
        your lovin' arms ¶      

15:33.300 --> 15:35.801
You have the ability to really  
speak to a large audience       

15:35.803 --> 15:38.136
In a really genuine way,        
   and i love that.             

15:38.138 --> 15:40.305
               There's a warmth 
                to your voice.  

15:40.307 --> 15:42.441
              It really hits you
              in the heart, man.

15:42.443 --> 15:46.178
 I may not seem like the obvious
    choice for you, but i <i> am.</i>   

15:46.180 --> 15:47.913
            You know,           
     i'm gonna go with blake.   

15:47.915 --> 15:49.581
             I can't believe it!

15:49.583 --> 15:52.885
              Daly:             
  Krista hughes was a small-town
   girl with big music dreams.  

15:52.887 --> 15:54.152
   Krista: Before "the voice,"  

15:54.154 --> 15:56.054
       I'd never even been      
         on an airplane.        

15:56.056 --> 15:59.524
       I never anticipated      
 seeing los angeles, california.

15:59.526 --> 16:00.959
     ¶ ...Lightning was... ¶    

16:00.961 --> 16:05.430
  Her classic-country sound also
   impressed all four coaches.  

16:05.432 --> 16:08.734
  ¶ that flies from montgomery ¶

16:08.736 --> 16:10.235
                  Thank you     
               for being good!  

16:10.237 --> 16:12.004
       I think                  
that it was flawless.           

16:12.006 --> 16:14.373
         Some of your influences
           may not be the stuff 

16:14.375 --> 16:16.375
      That we're exactly hearing
            on the radio.       

16:16.377 --> 16:17.609
              Yeah.             

16:17.611 --> 16:19.745
          You need somebody     
     who can get there with you.

16:19.747 --> 16:20.712
          I pick blake.         

16:20.714 --> 16:22.848
                  All right!    

16:22.850 --> 16:24.016
         Come on in here.       

16:24.018 --> 16:25.284
                     Oh!        
                 Oh, my god.    
              Hey.              

16:25.286 --> 16:26.652
             Come meet my friend
             brad paisley.      

16:26.654 --> 16:28.553
              Holy crap.        

16:28.555 --> 16:30.289
    I'm a huge brad paisley fan.

16:30.291 --> 16:33.258
 Last week,                     
 i was jamming out to his album,

16:33.260 --> 16:34.760
   And today,                   
   i'm standing in front of him.

16:34.762 --> 16:36.194
                This is crazy.  

16:36.196 --> 16:38.830
     I gave chris and krista    
   "when i get where i'm going" 

16:38.832 --> 16:40.599
         By brad paisley        
        and dolly parton.       

16:40.601 --> 16:42.367
This is one of my favorite songs

16:42.369 --> 16:45.137
      Because it's just got     
     such a powerful message.   

16:45.139 --> 16:48.307
    Krista's a country singer,  
    and chris is a pop singer,  

16:48.309 --> 16:50.042
  But they're both storytellers.

16:50.044 --> 16:51.576
                 At the time    
                i recorded it,  

16:51.578 --> 16:54.913
     I had lost my favorite aunt
              to cancer.        

16:54.915 --> 16:58.283
                It's lyrically  
             and musically meant

16:58.285 --> 16:59.685
              To stir something 
                in your soul.   

16:59.687 --> 17:01.386
             Now i want to hear 
           donny and marie here.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.454
           [ laughter ]         

17:02.456 --> 17:04.489
             Little bit country,
               little bit pop.  

17:04.491 --> 17:08.694
                 ¶ when i get   
              where i'm going ¶ 

17:08.695 --> 17:12.431
    ¶ there'll be               
  only happy tears ¶            

17:12.433 --> 17:16.001
  The song is in her wheelhouse,
    being a country musician,   

17:16.002 --> 17:20.105
       And we're playing it     
     for this amazing artist,   

17:20.107 --> 17:21.205
        And it's his song,      

17:21.208 --> 17:22.874
         So the pressure        
      was definitely there.     

17:22.876 --> 17:27.913
        ¶ yeah, when i get      
        where i'm going ¶       

17:27.915 --> 17:29.014
                     Wow.       

17:29.016 --> 17:32.851
          ¶ there'll be         
        only happy tears ¶      

17:32.853 --> 17:35.887
    Blake: Chris, naturally,    
with his tone, sounds emotional.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.557
   He's able to make you think, 
    "man, this guy's hurting."  

17:38.559 --> 17:40.959
That's such a gift and something
    you can't teach anybody.    

17:40.961 --> 17:42.861
           I just lost          
          my granddaddy.        

17:42.863 --> 17:43.962
         It's hard for me       
            to sing it          

17:43.964 --> 17:45.297
    Because i keep going there  
           in my head.          

17:45.299 --> 17:46.732
             When you're getting
                too emotional,  

17:46.734 --> 17:47.866
        Think of a shark attack.

17:47.868 --> 17:48.867
                Okay.           
          [ laughter ]          

17:48.869 --> 17:50.035
          That'll take you      
          right out of it.      

17:50.037 --> 17:52.037
         But see? You're already
         not about to cry.      

17:52.039 --> 17:53.872
      Brad: If they combine     

17:53.874 --> 17:56.341
       The presence of mind     
  of what they're singing about 

17:56.343 --> 17:59.044
         With the ability       
    to not get <i> too</i> emotional,   

17:59.046 --> 18:00.479
    Neither one will go home.   

18:00.481 --> 18:01.780
                 You want me    
                to play along?  

18:01.782 --> 18:03.081
            Come on.            
       Yeah, yeah. Do it.       
                I'll play along.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.149
             Please.            

18:04.151 --> 18:06.818
  He actually played his guitar 
             with us.           

18:06.820 --> 18:08.653
           That's like          
   a once-in-a-lifetime thing.  

18:08.655 --> 18:19.498
           ¶ when i get         
    where i'm goiiiiiiiiiing ¶  

18:19.500 --> 18:22.734
      Krista, we need more      
female singers in country music,

18:22.736 --> 18:24.569
            And i don't want you
                  to lose       

18:24.571 --> 18:27.639
   Any of that adventurous thing
        you do melodically.     

18:27.641 --> 18:29.074
       But learn it really well.
   Krista: Yeah.                

18:29.076 --> 18:31.009
    Get a game plan together.   
   Yeah.                        

18:32.246 --> 18:34.179
              Daly:             
   As their battle approaches,  

18:34.181 --> 18:36.748
      Krista and chris meet     
   with blake and brad paisley  

18:36.750 --> 18:38.216
  For a rehearsal with the band.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.685
             ¶ here, yeaaaaaah ¶

18:40.687 --> 18:44.556
    ¶ so much pain              
and so much darkness ¶          

18:44.558 --> 18:49.561
¶ and so much work to do,       
      ooh, ooh ¶                

18:49.563 --> 18:50.862
        Blake: All right,       
        i got a question.       

18:50.864 --> 18:52.164
           Do you think         
        that gives her --       

18:52.166 --> 18:53.732
             The shining moment?
                     No.        

18:53.734 --> 18:55.133
    You know what i'm saying?   
                           I do.

18:55.135 --> 18:58.970
  This is a guy's song in my key
  and not yours,                

18:58.972 --> 19:01.873
And so i think we're gonna      
have to write a different melody

19:01.875 --> 19:03.408
               And turn this    
               into your moment.

19:03.410 --> 19:08.713
 Brad paisley literally rewrites
 his own song so it will fit me.

19:08.715 --> 19:15.187
            ¶ ooh, ooh, oh, oh ¶

19:15.189 --> 19:16.588
           You know what i mean?
             Yes.               

19:16.590 --> 19:18.223
              Brad:             
   Any time you get that chance 

19:18.225 --> 19:20.625
 To sing three lines by yourself
           of anything,         

19:20.627 --> 19:22.127
            Make sure           
      they're not mediocre.     

19:22.129 --> 19:23.295
     Make sure they're great.   

19:23.297 --> 19:26.431
¶ so much work to do ¶          

19:26.433 --> 19:30.802
  ¶ ooh, ooh, ooh ¶             

19:30.804 --> 19:32.404
Like that?                      
      That's really pretty.     

19:32.406 --> 19:34.206
     It's definitely different  
    than the record, but cool --

19:34.208 --> 19:35.740
                  And what      
            we <i> should</i> have done.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.442
            [ laughs ]          

19:37.444 --> 19:39.911
        I just really hope      
         that both of you       

19:39.913 --> 19:42.914
   Completely open your hearts  
        up on that stage.       

19:42.916 --> 19:45.750
  This may be the greatest song 
      ever to do that with.     

19:45.752 --> 19:47.586
           So if you're thinking
            of the right thing, 

19:47.588 --> 19:49.221
            Those people at home
                    know.       
                 Yeah.          

19:49.223 --> 19:51.823
         Krista and chris       
    are both four-chair turns,  

19:51.825 --> 19:54.559
  And they're both gonna have to
     get lost in this moment.   

19:54.561 --> 19:55.927
Whichever one does that the best

19:55.929 --> 19:57.696
      Is gonna be the winner    
         of this battle.        

19:58.899 --> 20:02.234

  Coming up, chris and krista   
leave their hearts on the stage.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.777
        Daly: And later...      

20:12.779 --> 20:13.812

20:17.518 --> 20:19.484
     You're just sitting there  
    staring at her like a freak.

      for chris and krista.     

23:17.931 --> 23:19.931
  Blake, we'll give you a minute
     to think about that one.   

23:19.933 --> 23:22.033
            Pharrell,           
        what'd you think?       

23:22.035 --> 23:24.836
    Chris, i thought i had you  
 pegged in the very first verse.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.072
       I'm like, "oh, okay,     
     he's got a soft voice."    

23:27.074 --> 23:29.174
      Then all of a sudden,     
   you go to your chest voice,  

23:29.176 --> 23:30.909
   And it's like super-strong.  

23:30.911 --> 23:32.277
             That was           
    a great performance, man.   

23:32.279 --> 23:34.746
           [ applause ]         

23:34.748 --> 23:37.315
    Krista, there was a couple  
    flat notes in that bridge,  

23:37.317 --> 23:39.050
      But coming out of it,     

23:39.052 --> 23:41.653
     I felt like it was just    
  as strong as when you started.

23:41.655 --> 23:44.689
 In the blinds, i always thought
 that you had something special.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.558
           But i think          
      i would go with chris.    

23:46.560 --> 23:48.126
     [ cheers and applause ]    

23:48.128 --> 23:49.661
              Gwen?             

23:49.663 --> 23:51.696
      Chris, i can't believe    
  what your voice sounded like. 

23:51.698 --> 23:56.000
         Just so soothing       
     and rich and controlled.   

23:56.002 --> 23:57.669
   And right when you came in,  

23:57.671 --> 24:00.638
  I got, like, goose bumps all  
the way up my body, like, twice.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.975
            Together,           
   your voices blended so well. 

24:03.977 --> 24:07.011
       If i had to choose,      
   i would probably say chris.  

24:07.013 --> 24:08.446
     Daly: Thank you, coach.    
              Adam?             

24:08.448 --> 24:10.281
Adam: You both came in,         
   and i was like,              

24:10.283 --> 24:12.050
"this is gonna be the           
best battle we've ever had."    

24:12.052 --> 24:13.885
But, krista, you lost control   
of the range a little bit.      

24:13.887 --> 24:15.086
       And then                 
right after that, chris,        

24:15.088 --> 24:17.188
You made this face like,        
      "oh, no."                 

24:17.190 --> 24:19.791
But otherwise, i think          
you guys are both exceptional,  

24:19.793 --> 24:21.126
   Two of our best.             

24:21.128 --> 24:22.360
     [ cheers and applause ]    

24:22.362 --> 24:24.095
         Blake, you have        
       the final decision.      

24:24.097 --> 24:26.831
      Chris, you did a great job
       of taking a country song 

24:26.833 --> 24:29.634
             And turning it into
                 what you do.   

24:29.636 --> 24:31.903
               And you're       
       a great storyteller, man.

24:31.905 --> 24:35.273
     And, krista, that bridge --
       it's still haunting us,  

24:35.275 --> 24:39.277
   But you did an incredible job
       of taking a male song    

24:39.279 --> 24:42.180
           And finding places   
        to make your voice work.

24:42.182 --> 24:43.882
             It was really good.

24:43.884 --> 24:45.583

  Krista's an incredible singer,

25:11.978 --> 25:14.813
     But chris was way more     
consistent with his performance.

25:14.815 --> 25:18.049
  Moving forward, he comes from 
   a pop/christian background,  

25:18.051 --> 25:21.019
    And that's gonna be good    
for my diverse team that i want.

     I'm going to knockouts.

Siahna, i love your tone,       

29:43.116 --> 29:45.216
    But i want you              
to strengthen your vibrato      

29:45.218 --> 29:47.752
'cause it's what gives          
your singing dynamics.

       everything they say.

  one of the reasons

                     Ooh!       
                  [ laughs ]    

30:13.913 --> 30:15.947
             Ivonne:            
     Siahna -- she's only 15,   

30:15.949 --> 30:18.649
But she's got a lot of surprises
       under her sleeve,        

30:18.651 --> 30:20.952
     So going up against her    
        is gonna be tough.      

30:20.954 --> 30:23.020
 ¶ ...Why don't you,            
       baby? ¶                  

30:23.022 --> 30:27.058
            ¶ get out my life,  
          why don't you, baby? ¶

30:27.060 --> 30:29.560
 Okay, so, i see you            
turn it all the way on.         

30:29.562 --> 30:31.496
  But while you sing            
very beautifully, like,         

30:31.498 --> 30:33.998
I do notice that you're --      
  you're like this.             

30:34.000 --> 30:36.200
               Don't be afraid  
                  to let go.    

30:36.202 --> 30:37.602
                  You know,     
                i ain't saying  

30:37.604 --> 30:39.537
             Start twerking     
       on the piano, now, but --

30:39.539 --> 30:40.538
          [ laughter ]          
                  no.           

30:40.540 --> 30:42.106
               You know, let go.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.442
       Missy: Ivonne seemed     
       to be holding back.      

30:44.444 --> 30:46.811
   She has to let the fear go.  

30:46.813 --> 30:50.114
 And if she does that, she'll be
   a force to be reckoned with. 

30:50.116 --> 30:52.083
And the eyes are the windows    
 to the soul, right?            

30:52.085 --> 30:53.384
                 Yeah.          

30:53.386 --> 30:55.119
If the windows are closed,      
we don't know if anyone's home. 

30:55.121 --> 30:56.087
              Okay.             

30:56.089 --> 30:57.088
     Let us in.                 
              Okay.             

30:57.090 --> 30:58.623
              [ laughter ]      

30:58.625 --> 31:00.091
    Diana ross and the supremes,

31:00.093 --> 31:02.660
   They evoke feeling every time
   you listen to the record.    

31:02.662 --> 31:03.728
                  Thank you!    

31:03.730 --> 31:05.229
          And i thought         
       they did a good job,     

31:05.231 --> 31:06.864
    But i can't wait for them   
      to <i> learn it</i> learn it,     

31:06.866 --> 31:08.199
        'cause i feel like      
        they gonna give us      

31:08.201 --> 31:09.300
  All the feeling that we need. 

31:09.302 --> 31:10.802
                 That was us.   

31:10.804 --> 31:11.969
                  [ laughs ]    

31:11.971 --> 31:15.439
      I guess that was all of us
           many years ago.      

31:15.441 --> 31:17.241
              Daly:             
     With their battle near,    

31:17.243 --> 31:19.877
      Ivonne and siahna join    
    pharrell and missy elliott  

31:19.879 --> 31:21.145
      For a final rehearsal.    

31:21.147 --> 31:25.082
              ¶ set me free,    
          why don't you, baby? ¶

31:25.084 --> 31:29.053
  ¶ get out my life,            
why don't you, baby? ¶          

31:29.055 --> 31:31.022
         You little firecracker.

31:31.024 --> 31:32.156
           [ laughter ]         

31:32.158 --> 31:33.724
   Pharrell: That's much better 
         since yesterday.       

31:33.726 --> 31:35.259
    But i definitely want you   

31:35.261 --> 31:36.994
    To strengthen your vibrato  
        a little bit more.      

31:36.996 --> 31:39.764
        Okay.                   
                   Just add     
        a little bit more sauce.

31:39.766 --> 31:41.265
        That should be          
        your main focus,        

31:41.267 --> 31:43.100
 'cause you don't have a problem
 with engaging.                 

31:43.102 --> 31:46.003
        Singing a note straight 
        is like boldface print, 

31:46.005 --> 31:49.540
        And vibrato is like     
        singing in calligraphy. 

31:49.542 --> 31:51.776
       Vocally,                 
       you have to be explosive,

31:51.778 --> 31:53.878
        'cause i want you       
        to be the threat        

31:53.880 --> 31:55.713
        That i feel             
        every time you sing.    

31:55.715 --> 31:56.914
       Mm-hmm.                  
           I feel it.           

31:56.916 --> 31:59.584
           And then, ivonne,    
           i want you to engage.

31:59.586 --> 32:01.953
       Just block everything out

32:01.955 --> 32:05.056
          And just give your all
          as if it's that night.

32:05.058 --> 32:08.226
                 Here we go.    
                 "let's go!"    

32:08.228 --> 32:11.996
    ¶ set me free,              
why don't you, baby? ¶          

32:11.998 --> 32:13.130
          ¶ get out my life... ¶

32:13.132 --> 32:15.366
              Missy:            
     There's no time for 20%.   

32:15.368 --> 32:18.369
      You have to give 100%     
      because it's a battle.    

32:18.371 --> 32:20.171
       ¶ yeah ¶                 

32:23.343 --> 32:24.709
   You know how you were like,  

32:24.711 --> 32:26.177
       "oh, what do i do?       
         What do i do?"         
yeah, yeah, yeah.               

32:26.179 --> 32:28.779
That's where                    
you're supposed to take charge. 

32:28.781 --> 32:30.047
   Mm-hmm.                      
                   Right.       

32:30.049 --> 32:33.651
         You're a beautiful girl
         with a beautiful voice,

32:33.653 --> 32:35.319
      And i know you're capable.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.954
       Ivonne: I was so nervous,

32:36.956 --> 32:39.490
  And pharrell just made me feel
  really good about myself.     

32:39.492 --> 32:41.392
              You could do      
              anything you want.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.193
                    Yeah.       

32:42.195 --> 32:43.127
             Come on,           
          shake it off.         

32:43.129 --> 32:44.295

32:44.297 --> 32:45.997
              That harlem shake.
           Get loose.           

32:45.999 --> 32:48.199
               Do some squats.  
           [ laughter ]         

32:48.201 --> 32:50.134
   That's what i'm saying.      
                     New dance. 

32:50.136 --> 32:51.402
           [ laughter ]         

32:51.404 --> 32:52.637
              You can beat this.
Yeah.                           

32:52.639 --> 32:55.940
    Jump out the window with me.
       You're not gonna fall.   

32:55.942 --> 32:57.842
             ¶ you don't want me
                for yourself ¶  

32:57.844 --> 33:01.545
  Ivonne has a lot of potential 
  that she's just now accepting.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.015
    ¶ let me find               
   somebody else ¶              

33:04.017 --> 33:05.383
             ¶ hey ¶            

33:05.385 --> 33:07.251
    Pharrell: I don't know how  
   i'm gonna decide this battle 

33:07.253 --> 33:09.120
     Because it's two people    
    with two different issues.  

33:09.122 --> 33:11.956
       ¶ and set me free ¶      

33:11.958 --> 33:14.492
   Pharrell: I think the person 
      that we feel the most     

33:14.494 --> 33:15.726
 Is the person that i'll choose.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.128
                You know        
        this is a whole new you.

33:17.130 --> 33:19.363
                And that was    
            a great performance.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.465
  I'm very proud of             
      you guys.                 
           You guys did amazing.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.500

33:22.502 --> 33:24.168
      ¶ keep me hangin' on ¶    

33:24.170 --> 33:26.203
    Daly: ...Ivonne and siahna  
          take the stage        

33:26.205 --> 33:28.973
       And have our coaches     
         eager to steal.        

33:28.975 --> 33:30.074
It's like cute overload.        

33:31.344 --> 33:32.910
               No!              
         [ both giggle ]        

33:32.912 --> 33:35.146
   You were always meant to be  
           on my team.          

33:35.148 --> 33:36.580
               You're so pissed 
                  right now.    

33:36.582 --> 33:38.115
      This is a good battle.    

33:43.989 --> 33:44.021

   Welcome back to the battles. 

33:49.362 --> 33:51.295
         Now it's time          
for ivonne and siahna to battle,

33:51.297 --> 33:54.498
      But only one will win     
   and remain on team pharrell. 

33:54.500 --> 33:56.033
       I'm just as nervous      
         as you guys are.

          [ both laugh ]        

33:57.070 --> 33:59.070
           I just love          
      both of your energies.    

33:59.072 --> 34:00.538
          So, how do you        
       let one of those go?     

34:00.540 --> 34:01.839

         Let's make this        
      the battle of the day.    

34:05.111 --> 34:06.644
You got it.                     
              That's our plan.  

34:09.482 --> 34:11.482
    I would really love to win  
           this battle          

34:11.484 --> 34:14.217
  Because i'm from a little town
          in washington.        

34:14.219 --> 34:18.822
        This is definitely      
 the biggest opportunity for me.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.324
Ivonne: I do not want to go back
    to the cantaloupe farm.     

34:21.327 --> 34:23.260
            I'm hoping          
      that this time around,    

34:23.262 --> 34:24.862
  I can just control the nerves 

34:24.864 --> 34:27.164
         And really sing        
      like it's my last time    

34:27.166 --> 34:29.632
   So it <i> won't</i> be my last time.

        from team pharrell      

34:31.371 --> 34:33.103
           Will advance         
        to the knockouts?       

34:33.106 --> 34:35.672
    Will it be the 17-year-old  
       second-chance artist

             on this show, dude.
         [ laughter ]           

41:03.329 --> 41:06.230

   Daly: Blake shelton steals

       What is happening?!      

41:29.088 --> 41:30.354
       ¶ through the fire ¶

          in the knockout round.
             What?!             

41:35.861 --> 41:36.760
             Wow!               

41:36.762 --> 41:38.228
   I am so excited.             

41:38.230 --> 41:39.830
              Thank you so much.

41:39.832 --> 41:42.633
            Ivonne:             
Gwen is amazing, but i've always
   wanted to work with blake.   

41:42.635 --> 41:44.234
         I'm so excited.        

41:44.236 --> 41:48.238
     Oh, you are                
 in so much trouble.            

41:48.240 --> 41:51.875
  Gwen: I was seriously shocked 
      that she picked blake.    

41:51.877 --> 41:54.378
      It just made no sense,    
         and i'm furious.       

41:54.380 --> 41:55.546
    And blake is gonna get it.  

41:55.548 --> 41:58.248
      Blake: I'm really glad    
     i got ivonne on my team.   

41:58.250 --> 42:00.150
     She's got a great voice.   

42:00.152 --> 42:03.854
There's something about her that
we still haven't discovered yet.

42:03.856 --> 42:08.659
   And even though i absolutely 
  mopped the floor with gwen... 

42:09.762 --> 42:11.528
     ...Felt a little bit bad   
            about it.           

42:11.530 --> 42:13.897
   Hey, don't cry.              
                 I'm not crying.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.799
 Don't cry.                     
     Pharrell: I can't believe  
          you got that.         

42:15.801 --> 42:30.781
      Honestly,                 
      that was not okay with me.
