$150,000 horse
and the big man's daughter...

00:05.505 --> 00:06.438
you pull this off,

00:06.506 --> 00:07.705
you'll look like a genius.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.174
I've never,
never had a client

00:09.241 --> 00:10.408
that didn't become
a better rider

00:10.475 --> 00:11.609
in the first day,

00:11.677 --> 00:13.778
and the secret
is this new bit.

00:13.845 --> 00:14.745
I wanna know
what's going on,

00:14.813 --> 00:15.879
and most importantly,

00:15.947 --> 00:18.048
I wanna know why
you didn't tell me?

00:18.116 --> 00:20.618
Bedford Oil is about
two days away from insolvency;

00:20.686 --> 00:22.486
That's personal
and professional bankruptcy.

00:22.554 --> 00:23.688
I'm broke.

00:23.755 --> 00:25.555
Well, then you have
to go there.

00:25.623 --> 00:27.290
I'm actually getting better!
Watch this!

00:27.358 --> 00:28.391
Riana don't do
the big jumps;

00:28.459 --> 00:30.360
We haven't worked
on them yet!

00:31.662 --> 00:33.463
<i>Stewart:</i>
<i>Riana!</i>

00:34.532 --> 00:37.033
Your job was to get them ready
for competition in two weeks,

00:37.100 --> 00:40.937
but instead you managed
to injure them both.

00:41.004 --> 00:44.039
I made you into
the <i>Miracle girl</i>...

00:44.106 --> 00:46.141
I can unmake you.

01:00.121 --> 01:02.990
(Clucks her tongue)
Keep goin'.

01:03.058 --> 01:04.325
You can do it.

01:10.799 --> 01:12.533
You're all right.

01:12.601 --> 01:13.700
You're okay.

01:16.804 --> 01:17.838
Hey!

01:17.905 --> 01:19.373
Well, if it isn't
the honeymooner!

01:19.440 --> 01:21.842
Yeah! Just got back
last night.

01:21.909 --> 01:23.710
So... Italia.

01:23.778 --> 01:25.345
Well, my friend,
if you think you know Italy

01:25.413 --> 01:27.280
because you've been
to a couple of pizza joints,

01:27.348 --> 01:28.782
think again.

01:28.850 --> 01:30.015
So it's not all about
the pie then?

01:30.083 --> 01:31.851
No. No, it is not.

01:31.918 --> 01:33.318
Take Rome, for instance.

01:33.387 --> 01:34.653
Three million people;

01:34.721 --> 01:36.255
<i>Two million of them</i>
<i>are statues.</i>

01:36.322 --> 01:38.891
And most of them
don't wear pants.

01:40.494 --> 01:42.027
Is it true you're suing Amy?

01:42.095 --> 01:44.096
You can't do that!

01:44.163 --> 01:45.463
Riana,

01:45.531 --> 01:47.965
I paid $150,000 for a horse
that may be ruined.

01:48.033 --> 01:49.166
I can't let that go.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.835
But it was my fault!

01:50.903 --> 01:52.270
I was trying
to show off for you

01:52.337 --> 01:53.872
so you wouldn't be mad.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.306
Amy was just trying to help.

01:55.374 --> 01:58.075
She knew I wasn't good enough
to compete on Addison.

01:58.143 --> 02:00.077
Everybody knew except you.

02:00.145 --> 02:01.279
You are the one

02:01.346 --> 02:05.516
who wants me to be
a <i>Grand Prix</i> jumper.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.518
I just...

02:07.585 --> 02:10.721
I just wanted you
to be proud of me...

02:10.788 --> 02:13.323
For something, that's all.

02:14.225 --> 02:16.159
Look, once your wrist
is healed...

02:16.227 --> 02:21.030
No, dad,
I'm tired of trying.

02:21.097 --> 02:24.434
I don't wanna ride anymore...
ever.

02:30.674 --> 02:31.808
<i>Caleb:</i>
<i>How's things going here?</i>

02:31.875 --> 02:34.743
What's with all
the new colts?

02:35.645 --> 02:37.145
Those aren't just any colts.

02:37.212 --> 02:39.714
Those are Chase Powers'
signature colts.

02:39.782 --> 02:41.683
Amy's working
with one right now.

02:41.751 --> 02:44.385
Amy's starting colts
for Chase?

02:44.454 --> 02:45.720
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah,</i>

02:45.788 --> 02:47.121
<i>and he's selling them</i>
<i>on his website.</i>

02:47.189 --> 02:48.189
<i>She doing all the work</i>

02:48.257 --> 02:49.824
and he's getting
all the glory.

02:49.891 --> 02:51.391
Well, it sounds like
a sweet deal for him,

02:51.460 --> 02:52.893
but it doesn't really seem

02:52.961 --> 02:54.895
like something
Amy would go for.

02:54.963 --> 02:57.197
Yeah, well, welcome home.

02:57.265 --> 02:59.399
So you guys are...?

03:01.202 --> 03:02.269
No.

03:08.008 --> 03:12.445
Jack: I still don't know why
a man trying to ruin us

03:12.513 --> 03:14.814
gets invited over for tea.

03:14.882 --> 03:17.884
Lou: The very fact that Stewart
even accepted our invitation

03:17.952 --> 03:21.287
shows that he's trying
to be reasonable.

03:21.355 --> 03:22.654
You know, he probably
wants to avoid

03:22.722 --> 03:24.823
this whole court thing
as much as we do.

03:24.891 --> 03:26.257
If the man's so reasonable,

03:26.325 --> 03:28.794
why did he get his lawyer
to write this letter?

03:28.862 --> 03:30.929
Because that's how it's done.

03:30.997 --> 03:34.232
Really?
Suing us for loss of use,

03:34.300 --> 03:36.735
damages,
pain and suffering...

03:36.803 --> 03:39.136
Okay, grandpa, just remember

03:39.204 --> 03:41.271
that this is
just a negotiation.

03:41.339 --> 03:42.540
It's just about money

03:42.608 --> 03:44.976
and we're not going
to get emotional.

03:45.043 --> 03:46.310
Well, of course not.

03:46.378 --> 03:50.481
Because nobody ever
gets emotional about money.

03:51.517 --> 03:52.617
(Truck rumbles)

03:58.656 --> 04:00.156
(Clucks her tongue)

04:01.158 --> 04:02.225

04:16.873 --> 04:18.774
Will Amy be joining us?

04:18.841 --> 04:20.009
Lou:
Uh, no.

04:20.076 --> 04:23.946
Um, she has a very busy
schedule.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.648
I was surprised to see her
still working with horses.

04:26.715 --> 04:28.850
What is that
supposed to mean?

04:28.918 --> 04:30.585
Just that news travels fast.

04:30.653 --> 04:32.687
Lou: It seems to me
that all of us here

04:32.755 --> 04:34.656
are interested in
the same thing:

04:34.723 --> 04:36.591
A quick resolution.

04:36.659 --> 04:38.092
Yes, well, anything
to avoid the cost

04:38.160 --> 04:40.895
and unpleasantness
of a lengthy court case.

04:40.963 --> 04:43.597
Something we can
all agree on.

04:43.665 --> 04:47.333
<i>Stewart:</i> <i>Which is why I'm
willing</i> <i>to overlook damages</i>

04:47.401 --> 04:49.803
and settle for the cost
of the horse.

04:49.871 --> 04:51.805
Write me a cheque
for $150,000

04:51.873 --> 04:54.307
and I'll be happy
to call it a day.

04:54.375 --> 04:56.209
Well, that is
one hell of a day.

04:56.277 --> 04:57.410
Okay. Uh... wait!

04:57.478 --> 04:59.178
Let's just talk about this.

04:59.245 --> 05:02.648
We're all adults here.
Let's be reasonable.

05:02.716 --> 05:06.185
Stewart, this is not
just about money.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.122
My sister has a gift...
you've seen it...

05:10.190 --> 05:11.457
and that lawyer's letter,

05:11.524 --> 05:13.992
it paints her
as some kind of criminal,

05:14.060 --> 05:16.527
and that is so not true.

05:17.463 --> 05:19.598
Amy puts her heart
and her soul

05:19.665 --> 05:22.300
into every animal
that she touches

05:22.367 --> 05:25.036
and she would never ever
do anything

05:25.104 --> 05:26.404
to harm any animal.

05:26.472 --> 05:30.240
And this whole lawsuit
is just completely bogus.

05:31.209 --> 05:32.509
It's okay, it's all right.

05:32.577 --> 05:33.944
Stewart:
All right,

05:34.012 --> 05:35.278
clearly this is getting us
absolutely nowhere.

05:35.346 --> 05:37.180
You got that right,

Stewart:
No, don't bother.

I'll find my own way out.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.937
At least now we know
where we stand.

We need a good lawyer.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.206
Can we afford one?

08:45.274 --> 08:47.542
What we can't afford
is to lose,

08:47.609 --> 08:50.445

we need Chase as a witness.

08:50.513 --> 08:52.480

lined up.

09:53.771 --> 09:56.006
I'm sorry. I didn't know
there was a deadline.

09:56.074 --> 09:57.273
Yeah.
Come on, Chase.

09:57.341 --> 09:58.575
I mean, Amy doesn't need
any more pressure.

09:58.642 --> 10:01.478
No, no. No pressure.
I was just asking.

10:01.545 --> 10:02.612
Well, they're coming along

10:02.679 --> 10:03.813
and I love working
with them.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.381
I really appreciate
how you stuck with me

10:05.449 --> 10:08.485
even after everything
that's happened.

10:08.552 --> 10:11.387
But, Chase, I might need
your help with my case.

10:11.455 --> 10:14.490
What does it have
to do with me?

10:14.557 --> 10:16.625
Well, I was using
your "power bit"

10:16.692 --> 10:17.993
on Stewart's horse,

10:18.060 --> 10:19.628
and the lawyers might make
a big deal about that.

10:19.695 --> 10:20.862
Right, but you and I
both know

10:20.930 --> 10:22.464
that this is just
an ordinary bit.

10:22.532 --> 10:23.465
There is no way
it had anything to do

10:23.533 --> 10:24.600
with the girl's accident.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.634
Well, I know,
but I might need you

10:25.701 --> 10:26.635
to actually say that

10:26.702 --> 10:28.636
if this goes to court.

10:28.703 --> 10:29.870
Sure. Whatever.

10:29.938 --> 10:31.939
I'll do everything I can.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.941
Okay.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.143
Thanks.

10:37.712 --> 10:40.581
Yeah. No. I am aware that
the condo market is soft.

10:40.649 --> 10:42.450
But come on,
this isn't an offer,

10:42.518 --> 10:44.484
this is a joke.

10:44.552 --> 10:46.119
No, I can tell you right now

10:46.187 --> 10:47.987
my husband did not get
where he is

10:48.055 --> 10:49.523
buying high and selling low,

10:49.590 --> 10:53.793
so this offer is just a waste
of everybody's time.

10:57.398 --> 11:00.299
So he's already accepted
the offer?

11:03.102 --> 11:04.270
No. No, no, no.

11:04.337 --> 11:06.272
It's fine.

11:06.339 --> 11:09.208
Yeah. No problem.
Mm-hm.

11:10.177 --> 11:11.544
Okay. Talk soon.

11:17.650 --> 11:18.749
(Angry exhale)

11:24.557 --> 11:25.923
Riana:
Hey, Amy!

11:26.925 --> 11:28.159
Riana, hi.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.462
I was just thinking about
how I should call you

11:31.530 --> 11:33.430
and here you are.

11:33.498 --> 11:34.665
How weird is that?

11:34.732 --> 11:35.932
Very.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.535
Um, is your arm any better?

11:38.603 --> 11:41.271
Yeah. It only hurts
when I sleep on it funny.

11:41.339 --> 11:42.439
That's good.

11:42.507 --> 11:43.973
So you can start
riding again.

11:44.041 --> 11:45.442
No way.

11:45.510 --> 11:47.744
My dad is obviously
on my case,

11:47.812 --> 11:50.546
but I don't want to anymore.

11:51.481 --> 11:53.148
Why?
You love riding.

11:53.217 --> 11:54.684
Used to.

11:54.751 --> 11:57.220
And you were really helping me
get somewhere with Addison,

11:57.287 --> 12:01.190
but now, with everything
that's happened...

12:03.260 --> 12:05.460
If my dad knew
I was even talking to you...

12:05.528 --> 12:09.531
I mean, the whole thing,
it just... sucks.

12:10.933 --> 12:13.268
I know it does.

12:14.803 --> 12:17.772
You know, the next time
you think about calling me,

12:17.840 --> 12:20.874
don't just think
about it, okay?

12:21.809 --> 12:22.876
See you.

12:32.487 --> 12:34.388
(Sighs heavily)

12:37.190 --> 12:38.824
Now, shouldn't you be
in bed?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.660
After all,
you're sleeping for two now.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.063
I was going to call Peter,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.932
but I realized
that I have no idea

12:47.000 --> 12:49.402
what to say to him
right now.

12:50.304 --> 12:51.337
You know, I actually thought

12:51.405 --> 12:52.971
that he could go back
to Dubai

12:53.038 --> 12:56.908
and wave a magic wand
and save his company.

12:56.976 --> 13:00.412
But obviously
that is not going to happen.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.814
<i>I just, I wish that</i>
<i>he could just let me know</i>

13:02.882 --> 13:04.849
<i>what's going on;</i>

13:04.917 --> 13:06.785
Keep me in the loop.

13:06.852 --> 13:10.521
Well, maybe he doesn't want
to upset you.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.956
Yeah, it was better to hear it
from his real estate agent

13:13.024 --> 13:16.994
that he sold the condo
for less than he bought it for.

13:17.061 --> 13:18.763
<i>And after the liens</i>
<i>are discharged, grandpa,</i>

13:18.830 --> 13:21.365
<i>there is nothing left.</i>

13:21.433 --> 13:23.434
Well, that could be
a problem

13:23.502 --> 13:26.703
if you were dependent
on a husband financially,

13:26.771 --> 13:28.805
or if you didn't have
a dude ranch

13:28.872 --> 13:31.073
and a family business
to run.

13:31.141 --> 13:33.510
Yeah, that could be ruined
by a lawsuit.

13:33.577 --> 13:35.978
It's not gonna happen.

13:37.581 --> 13:39.215
Grandpa,
I can't help but feel like

13:39.283 --> 13:42.685
this is the worst possible time
to have a baby!

13:42.752 --> 13:44.252
Oh, honey...

13:44.321 --> 13:46.855
<i>(Loud bang,</i>
<i>objects clatter and smash)</i>

13:48.041 --> 13:49.775
Lou, stay here!

13:59.051 --> 14:00.417
What happened?

14:00.485 --> 14:01.752
Bear.

14:02.654 --> 14:04.188
When they're getting
ready to hibernate,

14:04.255 --> 14:08.292
they will eat anything
that isn't locked up.

14:08.359 --> 14:11.996
Well, they sure like
Lou's strawberry jam.

14:12.064 --> 14:13.663
Jam!

14:13.764 --> 14:16.099
You know, I reminded
that newlywed

14:16.166 --> 14:18.134
to make sure he locked up.

14:18.202 --> 14:19.302
But...

14:20.805 --> 14:24.874
He must have other things
on his so-called mind.

14:29.112 --> 14:31.814
Well, that was pretty crazy
about that bear last night.

14:31.881 --> 14:32.881
I'm off to school, man.

14:32.949 --> 14:34.182
Yeah, you know...

14:34.250 --> 14:35.651
The whole thing
kinda got me thinking.

14:35.719 --> 14:39.287
Just about bears
because of the way they work.

14:39.355 --> 14:40.455
They don't mate for life

14:40.523 --> 14:42.357
the way people
are supposed to.

14:42.425 --> 14:43.692
I mean, when a female bear
is in season,

14:43.760 --> 14:45.660
it's like la dolce vita
for any male

14:45.694 --> 14:47.194
that's in the area.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.395
You mean even if she has
a papa bear

14:48.463 --> 14:51.132
back in the trailer?

14:51.199 --> 14:52.366
<i>(Chuckles)</i> <i>Geez!</i>

14:52.434 --> 14:54.401
You've been on your own
way too long, man.

14:54.469 --> 14:55.803
Yeah, well,
I'm not going to pretend

14:55.871 --> 14:58.339
I'm not a little bit
put off.

14:58.406 --> 14:59.306
I just get back
om my honeymoon

14:59.374 --> 15:01.141
and my wife is M.I.A.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.143
Not exactly, man.
There's phones in Italy.

15:03.210 --> 15:04.177
You can call her.

15:04.245 --> 15:05.779
Yeah, I try, but...

15:06.748 --> 15:08.081
There's this time
zone thing,

15:08.149 --> 15:10.216
and I don't think her cell
works too good in Italy.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.085
Relax, man,
she's with her mom.

15:12.153 --> 15:13.353
What do you got
to worry about?

15:13.420 --> 15:16.356
Yeah, I guess it's only
another week or so.

15:16.423 --> 15:18.257
Exactly. See ya.

15:18.324 --> 15:19.591
See you, man.

15:24.531 --> 15:25.597
(Truck rumbles)

15:33.539 --> 15:35.439
(Horse trailer roars)

15:35.507 --> 15:36.808
(Tires screech)

15:41.947 --> 15:42.981
Ty:
Idiot!

15:47.619 --> 15:49.586
Chase: Thank you again
for helping out here.

15:49.654 --> 15:50.754
Caleb:
Yeah.

15:55.326 --> 15:57.027
Chase? Hey.

15:57.095 --> 15:58.762
What's going on?

15:58.830 --> 16:00.864
Uh, there's uh...
(Nervous chuckle)

16:00.932 --> 16:02.399
A situation.

16:02.466 --> 16:03.701
It's only temporary.

16:03.768 --> 16:06.468
I talked to my lawyer
and he advised me that,

16:06.536 --> 16:07.737
just to be on the safe side,

16:07.805 --> 16:09.538
I should take the horses
back to my place.

16:09.606 --> 16:11.074
Listen, I told you
they're not ready to go.

16:11.141 --> 16:12.775
I'm still working with them.

16:12.843 --> 16:14.443
That'll do it.

16:14.511 --> 16:15.745
Thanks.

16:15.813 --> 16:18.915
Um, look, I'll pay you
for the work you done.

16:18.982 --> 16:21.516
No, they're not ready to go.

16:21.584 --> 16:22.884
It's not about the horses.

16:22.952 --> 16:25.721
It's just a bad time
to be in business together.

16:30.827 --> 16:31.960
Look, it's nothing personal.

16:32.028 --> 16:34.495
It's just my reputation
is everything.

16:34.563 --> 16:35.630
I can't afford
to get mixed up

16:35.698 --> 16:37.664
with something
that might wreck it.

16:37.733 --> 16:40.801
Or <i>someone</i>
who might wreck it?

16:45.650 --> 16:47.094
<i>You didn't have to</i>
<i>help Chase Powers</i>

16:47.095 --> 16:48.697
load his damn horses
in the trailer!

16:48.764 --> 16:50.472
You want me to do my job
or not?

16:50.475 --> 16:52.643
Besides, I was happy
to see the cowboy leave.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.378
- Face it, Amy...
- Face what?

16:54.446 --> 16:55.646
Well, when it comes
to horses,

16:55.714 --> 16:57.548
you don't exactly share
the same philosophy.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.882
Oh, Caleb Odell
talking philosophy?

16:59.950 --> 17:01.017
Are you still gonna be
philosophical

17:01.085 --> 17:01.984
when you lose your job

17:02.052 --> 17:03.186
because we lose our business

17:03.254 --> 17:04.221
and can't afford
to pay you?!

17:04.288 --> 17:07.156
Yes, I will,
and you should be too.

17:07.224 --> 17:08.458
Since when are you
all about the money?

17:08.526 --> 17:09.925
I'm not.

17:09.992 --> 17:11.728
But maybe I should be.
Maybe that's my problem.

17:11.795 --> 17:15.797
No. Amy, that's what
makes you different.

17:19.269 --> 17:20.969
You know, I can get
all of these products online

17:21.037 --> 17:22.404
for half the price, right?

17:22.472 --> 17:24.005
Yes, but without
the personal service

17:24.073 --> 17:25.641
and connection
to your local merchants.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.343
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

17:27.410 --> 17:28.744
But I really have to start
doing something

17:28.811 --> 17:31.179
to cut back on expenses.

17:31.247 --> 17:32.447
Amy told me
about the lawsuit

17:32.514 --> 17:34.048
and Chase said
he would go to bat for her.

17:34.116 --> 17:35.283
(Scoffs) Yeah.

17:35.351 --> 17:37.084
He really hit one
out of the park.

17:37.152 --> 17:38.286
What do...
What do you mean?

17:38.354 --> 17:39.454
He told me he'd do
everything he could

17:39.521 --> 17:40.421
to help her out.

17:40.489 --> 17:41.689
Oh, he did?

17:41.757 --> 17:43.691
Well, I was...
I was there.

17:43.759 --> 17:45.126
Well, obviously
you weren't there

17:45.193 --> 17:47.094
when he came and dragged
all of his horses out

17:47.162 --> 17:49.062
this morning.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.530
I-I swear, Lou,

17:50.598 --> 17:52.466
I didn't know anything
about that.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.100
Big surprise a guy
not telling his girl

17:54.168 --> 17:56.670
what's really going on.

18:05.245 --> 18:06.879
Uh, you beat me to it.

18:06.946 --> 18:08.013
Yeah.

18:10.284 --> 18:11.617
Hey, I couldn't help
but noticing,

18:11.685 --> 18:13.719
there's a few less horses here
than when I left.

18:13.787 --> 18:15.621
Chase took them back.

18:15.689 --> 18:17.990
Oh, that's too bad.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.659
I can see you're all broke up
about it.

18:20.726 --> 18:23.194
He really stood by her
when she needed help.

18:23.262 --> 18:25.163
Yeah, well, I'm not much
of a fan either,

18:25.230 --> 18:28.199
but he was sending
a lot of business her way.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.202
So, if I were you,

18:31.270 --> 18:33.070
I'd wipe that smug grin
off your face

18:33.138 --> 18:35.472
before I went in the house.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.916
Lou: Is something wrong
with your chili, grandpa?

18:45.983 --> 18:47.250
Oh no...

18:47.319 --> 18:50.688
Except...
Well, where's the beef?

18:50.755 --> 18:53.255
There is no beef,
but there's plenty of quinoa.

18:56.193 --> 18:58.894
It's a seed
with a very high protein count.

18:58.962 --> 19:00.062
Lou's gone vegan.

19:00.130 --> 19:03.433
Meatless Mondays.
At least try it.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.902
Fine, but don't you think
that working people

19:06.970 --> 19:10.004
and pregnant women need
something substantial

19:10.072 --> 19:11.473
at the evening meal?

19:11.541 --> 19:13.408
There is going to be
some changes around here,

19:13.476 --> 19:15.009
<i>and this is just one of them.</i>

19:15.077 --> 19:16.745
We're gonna start buying
everything in bulk

19:16.813 --> 19:18.012
or no-name,

19:18.080 --> 19:19.448
and bartering
for goods and services

19:19.515 --> 19:21.182
whenever possible.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.417
Okay?

19:22.485 --> 19:23.584
This meal costs less
than that beer

19:23.652 --> 19:25.085
<i>you're washing it</i> <i>down with.</i>

19:25.153 --> 19:27.822
Oh, I think I might be
needing another one of these,

19:27.889 --> 19:29.289
Look, I'm sorry, you guys.

19:29.358 --> 19:32.358
This is just how
it's going to be, okay?

19:32.458 --> 19:35.858
Even if we dodge this lawsuit,
the legal bills alone can sink us.

19:35.958 --> 19:39.358
I get it, Lou. I made a mistake
and now you all have to pay for it.

19:40.058 --> 19:43.058
Nobody is blaming you Amy, there's
just a lot of stuff happening...

19:43.738 --> 19:45.438
all at once.

19:53.514 --> 19:55.947
I brought you some chili.

19:56.015 --> 19:57.115
Thank you.

20:00.420 --> 20:03.154
It's actually pretty good.

20:06.225 --> 20:07.158
Are you okay?

20:07.226 --> 20:08.293
(Sniffs)

20:13.331 --> 20:16.434
You know, I don't know
how my mom did it.

20:17.469 --> 20:19.103
I took a whole year
off school

20:19.170 --> 20:20.371
so I could see
what I could do,

20:20.439 --> 20:23.908
and all I can manage
is to screw up.

20:26.177 --> 20:27.844
Come on, Amy.

20:28.946 --> 20:30.246
You don't need
those big clinics

20:30.314 --> 20:32.616
or the brand name horses.

20:33.551 --> 20:34.584
Your mom never did.

20:34.652 --> 20:36.953
Ty, I am not like her.

20:37.021 --> 20:39.723
If I was, I wouldn't have gotten
involved with Stewart Forrest.

20:39.791 --> 20:42.325
I just, I felt all this
pressure about the money

20:42.393 --> 20:45.728
and making a name
for myself and...

20:47.664 --> 20:50.433
You know, maybe...
Maybe it's good thing

20:50.500 --> 20:52.435
my mom's not here.

20:53.369 --> 20:55.771
She can't see how bad
I've screwed up.

21:01.310 --> 21:03.478
Hey...

21:03.546 --> 21:04.946
It's okay.

21:08.617 --> 21:10.017
It's okay.

21:26.968 --> 21:28.201
(She exhales)

21:31.305 --> 21:32.371
(Exhales)

21:39.580 --> 21:42.448
(Rooster crows
in the distance)

21:49.489 --> 21:50.555
(Sigh)

21:57.363 --> 21:58.329
Come on, Spartan.

21:58.397 --> 21:59.498
(Hooves clop)

22:05.269 --> 22:06.670
(Spartan grunts)

22:16.848 --> 22:17.982
(Hooves thud lightly)

22:20.784 --> 22:21.951
(Birds chirp)

22:29.994 --> 22:31.594
Caleb:
Mornin', Jack. Lou.

22:31.662 --> 22:33.129
What do you got there?

22:33.196 --> 22:34.564
Oh, uh, I signed for it
on my way in.

22:34.632 --> 22:35.731
I don't know what it is.

22:35.798 --> 22:36.732
I thought I'd save
the courier

22:36.799 --> 22:38.433
a trip down the driveway.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.841
It's official.

22:45.909 --> 22:48.443
That creep has gone ahead
and sued us.

22:48.511 --> 22:49.945
You know, I had a chance
to negotiate

22:50.013 --> 22:51.246
my way out of this thing

22:51.313 --> 22:53.581
and instead I blew it,
grandpa!

22:53.649 --> 22:55.616
Well, Stewart Forrest
was not gonna settle,

22:55.684 --> 22:56.851
no matter what.

22:56.919 --> 22:58.185
Maybe if I hadn't
started to cry.

22:58.253 --> 22:59.486
I can't believe I did that!

22:59.555 --> 23:00.621
Relax, Lou,

23:00.689 --> 23:01.956
everyone knows
that pregnant ladies

23:02.024 --> 23:03.257
are drama queens.

23:03.324 --> 23:04.959
Oh, is that so?

23:05.961 --> 23:08.428
Because I'll have you know
that there are pregnant women

23:08.495 --> 23:10.697
who are running
major corporations.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.766
There are pregnant women
in the Olympics.

23:12.833 --> 23:15.669
There are even pregnant women
in the army.

23:15.736 --> 23:16.970
You know what?

23:17.038 --> 23:18.705
You can bet that
they don't start to cry

23:18.773 --> 23:22.275
every single time
that things get rough!

23:22.342 --> 23:23.642
<i>And guess what?</i>

23:24.911 --> 23:26.278
Neither will I!

23:31.350 --> 23:35.087
Do you ever eat at home
with your wife?

23:35.989 --> 23:38.390
Oh, it's a long story, Jack.

23:44.930 --> 23:45.930
(Startled whinny)

23:45.998 --> 23:47.498
You're okay, you're okay.

23:47.566 --> 23:48.800
What's wrong?

23:48.867 --> 23:50.267
(Spartan snorts)

23:50.335 --> 23:53.738
Go on.
We'll go this way.

23:53.806 --> 23:54.872
Let's go.

23:58.710 --> 24:00.310
Hey... what's wrong?
(Spartan snorts, agitated)

24:03.247 --> 24:05.248
You're okay...

24:05.316 --> 24:06.717
(Spartan whinnies, agitated)

24:08.853 --> 24:10.253
(Ominous music plays)

24:18.986 --> 24:20.319
Hey, how's it going, babe?

24:20.387 --> 24:21.387
If you're so interested,

24:21.455 --> 24:23.356
you would have returned
my calls.

24:23.423 --> 24:24.791
Chase:
(Sighs)

24:24.859 --> 24:26.359
I've been kind of busy.

24:26.426 --> 24:28.093
Soraya: With the horses
you took back from Amy?

24:28.161 --> 24:29.461
Come on, Soraya.

24:29.528 --> 24:31.563
Lou told me
Amy is devastated.

24:31.631 --> 24:32.765
All right, look.

24:32.832 --> 24:34.833
I know Amy's your friend
and all, but...

24:34.901 --> 24:36.501
The truth is
I did her a favour.

24:36.569 --> 24:39.404
By taking all her
business away?

24:39.472 --> 24:41.506
I wasn't gonna say anything
but...

24:41.574 --> 24:44.208
The truth is, with this
lawsuit and everything,

24:44.276 --> 24:46.543
Amy's been totally
burnt out.

24:46.611 --> 24:47.645
Working with these horses,

24:47.712 --> 24:50.514
it's just been
too much for her.

24:50.582 --> 24:51.482
Come on, it's not like
I'm gonna give the job

24:51.549 --> 24:52.850
to another trainer.

24:52.918 --> 24:54.451
I'm just waitin' until
this whole thing blows over

24:54.519 --> 24:57.321
and she gets back
on her feet.

24:59.357 --> 25:00.690
When do you get off work?

25:01.759 --> 25:04.795
(Horses whinny,
hooves clop on the hard surface)

25:07.088 --> 25:08.822
Can I help you?

25:08.890 --> 25:09.890
Hi.

25:09.958 --> 25:11.892
You're Amy's sister.
Lou, right?

25:11.960 --> 25:14.428
Yeah. I'm actually
looking for your dad.

25:14.495 --> 25:15.429
Is he around?

25:15.496 --> 25:17.763
Uh, I don't know.

25:17.831 --> 25:20.066
Maybe his office.

25:21.768 --> 25:22.936
I'll check the arena.

25:23.003 --> 25:25.003
Lou:
Uh, hang on a sec.

25:25.071 --> 25:27.306
<i>Is that Addison in there?</i>

25:28.308 --> 25:30.175
It is, isn't it?

25:30.243 --> 25:31.376
Oh...

25:31.445 --> 25:33.111
Amy is gonna be so happy
to hear

25:33.179 --> 25:34.413
that the horse is better.

25:34.481 --> 25:35.815
Do you mind
if I take a picture?

25:35.882 --> 25:37.115
Amy would love to see
a picture.

25:44.089 --> 25:45.156
Stewart:
Ms. fleming!

25:45.223 --> 25:47.224
Stewart! Great,
you're here.

25:48.193 --> 25:49.393
You know, I would have
called first...

25:49.462 --> 25:50.762
this is private property!

25:50.830 --> 25:52.831
But I kind of figured
you wouldn't take my call.

25:52.898 --> 25:54.466
Get out! Now!

25:54.533 --> 25:57.000
<i>Before I call the police!</i>

25:58.336 --> 25:59.436
Lou:
Thanks, Riana.

26:02.340 --> 26:04.040
I know that was Addison
in the arena.

26:04.108 --> 26:06.209
Oh, do you know much
about horses, Ms. fleming?

26:06.277 --> 26:07.410
He looked like
he was jumping

26:07.479 --> 26:09.045
and he didn't seem
to be hurting.

26:09.113 --> 26:12.047
Oh, so you know what a horse
like Addison can do?

26:12.115 --> 26:14.550
He's a metre-40 jumper,

26:14.618 --> 26:16.218
and now he can barely clear
a two-foot fence.

26:16.286 --> 26:18.287
I might not be up to speed
on all of the details,

26:18.355 --> 26:20.823
but I can tell when someone
is using a frivolous lawsuit

26:20.891 --> 26:22.959
as some kind of a cash grab.

26:23.026 --> 26:24.126
(Chuckles) Look, dear,

26:24.194 --> 26:27.396
I don't blame you
for being upset;

26:27.464 --> 26:28.897
Nobody likes to go to court,

26:28.965 --> 26:31.500
and I understand this is
a delicate time for you.

26:31.567 --> 26:33.935
You are wrong
on so many levels.

26:34.003 --> 26:35.604
I love a good lawsuit,

26:35.671 --> 26:38.206
especially when
the other side has no case.

26:38.273 --> 26:39.508
So bring it on,

26:39.575 --> 26:41.643
because it is going
to get ugly

26:41.711 --> 26:43.077
and the gloves
are coming off.

26:43.145 --> 26:45.278
No more little miss
nice guy.

26:45.346 --> 26:46.647
Oh, and by the way,

26:46.715 --> 26:50.718
don't you ever,
ever call me dear, Stewie.

26:52.286 --> 26:55.422
(Truck door slams
and Lou drives off)

26:55.957 --> 26:58.225
You know,
I used to love to ride,

26:58.292 --> 26:59.726
and I was even getting good!

26:59.793 --> 27:02.261
But you... you and this
stupid lawsuit,

27:02.329 --> 27:03.630
you've ruined everything!

27:03.697 --> 27:05.965
Now, come on, Riana.
Get away from me!

27:06.033 --> 27:07.066
I hate you!

27:19.579 --> 27:20.979
(Spartan snorts) Easy!

27:21.047 --> 27:22.080
You're okay.

27:25.251 --> 27:28.286
(Bear growls and grunts
as he saunters)

27:36.327 --> 27:37.929
(Spartan whinnies wildly)
It's okay, it's okay,

27:37.996 --> 27:39.363
it's okay, boy.

27:39.431 --> 27:41.265
There's nothing there.

27:41.332 --> 27:42.433
You're fine.

27:43.501 --> 27:46.170
(Branches snap, bear grunts)

27:51.141 --> 27:52.676
(Spartan whinnies wildly)
Stay! Whoa! Stay!

27:54.411 --> 27:55.511
It's okay!

27:58.248 --> 27:59.282
(Ferocious growl)

28:00.985 --> 28:03.485
(Spartan whinnies wildly)
Spartan, Spartan, whoa!

28:03.987 --> 28:05.020
Whoa!

28:05.088 --> 28:06.855
Ungh!
(Spartan whinnies wildly)

28:06.923 --> 28:08.523
(Loud, ferocious growl)

28:12.562 --> 28:14.997
(Loud, riled grunts)

28:25.198 --> 28:27.232
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Hey, man, you need a hand?</i>

28:27.300 --> 28:28.567
I'm not gonna say no,

28:28.635 --> 28:30.836
since Amy has taken
a mental health day.

28:30.903 --> 28:32.003
What?

28:32.071 --> 28:34.640
She's still out on a ride.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.108
Really?
She left pretty early.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.142
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.910
She's an independent lady.

28:39.978 --> 28:41.512
Got lots on her mind.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.681
So, so what if she wants
to stays out a little longer,

28:43.749 --> 28:45.416
if that's what
she wants to do?

28:45.484 --> 28:46.551
Maybe.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.755
I'm gonna take Harley
and go look for her.

28:50.823 --> 28:52.189
At your own peril.

28:53.124 --> 28:54.524
What are you talking about?

28:54.592 --> 28:55.759
Well, you don't want to be
all overprotective.

28:55.827 --> 28:58.562
She'll just get mad
and say she needs space.

28:58.629 --> 29:00.530
Trust me on this one.

29:00.598 --> 29:02.499
Is something going on
with Ash?

29:02.567 --> 29:03.734
Always,

29:03.801 --> 29:06.470
but this time, I just...
I don't know.

29:07.405 --> 29:08.905
Later, man.
We'll grab some beers,

29:08.973 --> 29:10.038
I promise.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.310
<i>Girl:</i> <i>(Muffled and distant)</i>
<i>Amy, wake up! Wake up!</i>

29:16.246 --> 29:17.980
<i>(Close by)</i> <i>Please, wake up!</i>

29:22.586 --> 29:24.987
(Birds chirp, grass rustles)

29:29.725 --> 29:30.825
Hey!

29:34.563 --> 29:35.597
Hey!

29:42.937 --> 29:45.773
Come on,
we have to get out of here.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.907
Take my hand.

29:53.281 --> 29:55.982
We can't be here anymore.
Quick.

30:00.687 --> 30:03.255
Come on, Kindling.
Let's get going.

30:19.004 --> 30:22.373
(Birds chirp in the distance)

30:29.448 --> 30:32.550
(Harley picks up pace)

30:35.186 --> 30:36.219
(Loud snort)

30:37.221 --> 30:38.322
Amy:
Did you see that?

30:39.891 --> 30:40.958
(Soft snort)

30:42.594 --> 30:44.595
This is a very
dangerous place.

30:44.663 --> 30:46.429
You have to go home.

30:46.497 --> 30:48.397
You don't belong here.

30:52.035 --> 30:53.102
Amy!

30:55.606 --> 30:57.039
Amy! (Echoing)

30:58.308 --> 31:00.743
Wait! Stop!
Did you hear that?

31:00.811 --> 31:04.012
No, Amy,
we have to keep going.

31:08.785 --> 31:10.853
(Bear snorts and grunts)

31:15.257 --> 31:16.324
(Harley snorts nervously)

31:18.393 --> 31:19.794
(Nervous snorts)

31:41.215 --> 31:42.248
Amy!

31:53.927 --> 31:54.994
<i>Spartan...</i>

32:01.401 --> 32:03.535
Hey, Spartan, hey.

32:06.105 --> 32:08.373
Come on, come on.

32:12.111 --> 32:14.145
You have to go this way.

32:15.447 --> 32:17.181
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy!</i>

32:17.249 --> 32:18.549
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Wait! Ty?</i>

32:19.984 --> 32:22.286
<i>Yeah! Come on!</i>
<i>It is this way!</i>

32:26.558 --> 32:27.824
Aren't you coming?

32:27.892 --> 32:28.892
It's okay.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.260
I'll be right here
watching you.

32:32.463 --> 32:34.764
Cross the river;
You'll be okay.

32:39.236 --> 32:40.636
(Soft whoosh)

33:03.592 --> 33:04.658
Amy! Hey!

33:06.962 --> 33:09.597
Amy! Hey...

33:09.664 --> 33:10.698
Amy:
Ty?

33:11.032 --> 33:12.933
Ty: You okay?
Amy: Ty?

33:13.935 --> 33:16.337
You must have had
a bad fall.

33:16.405 --> 33:18.037
(Panting)

33:18.106 --> 33:19.939
Where is she?

33:20.007 --> 33:22.875
Who? What are you
talking about?

33:23.811 --> 33:25.212
The little girl.

33:25.279 --> 33:26.346
(Dialling beeps)

33:30.485 --> 33:33.619
Jack, I'm gonna need
your help.

33:36.356 --> 33:38.557
<i>(Alarm clock beeps)</i>

33:46.399 --> 33:50.468
(Calling out) Amy?
Amy, how does your head feel?

33:51.903 --> 33:53.404
What is your name?
(Knocking on door)

33:53.472 --> 33:56.040
And do you know why
I'm asking you these questions?

33:56.108 --> 33:58.176
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>In here, Lou.</i>

34:00.712 --> 34:02.313
What's going on?

34:03.749 --> 34:07.284
Amy's just telling me
about a dream she had

34:07.352 --> 34:10.487
when that damn bear
spooked her horse.

34:10.554 --> 34:11.621
Yeah, but...

34:11.688 --> 34:14.724
You know,
it wasn't like a dream.

34:14.792 --> 34:16.493
There was this little girl

34:16.561 --> 34:18.695
and she told me
to come with her

34:18.763 --> 34:20.197
because the bear
was still around.

34:21.465 --> 34:23.032
And she had the cutest name
for her pony.

34:23.099 --> 34:25.201
Um... Kindling.

34:26.969 --> 34:28.804
(Taken aback laugh)

34:29.739 --> 34:33.342
What did she look like,
this... this little girl?

34:33.409 --> 34:36.911
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Um, well, she had
blonde hair</i> <i>in braids</i>

34:36.980 --> 34:38.746
and a red cowboy hat,

34:40.183 --> 34:42.250
<i>and she had this jacket</i>
<i>with fringes.</i>

34:43.485 --> 34:45.920
And, you know,
as long as I was with her,

34:45.987 --> 34:47.021
I was safe.

34:47.989 --> 34:49.224
And I could hear Ty
calling me,

34:49.292 --> 34:52.594
and I wanted to go to him
across the river,

34:52.661 --> 34:53.627
but the little girl told me

34:53.695 --> 34:55.829
that she couldn't
come with me.

34:55.897 --> 34:57.864
Grandpa, what are you
looking for?

34:57.932 --> 34:59.900
I think it's in here.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.503
There's a picture in here...

35:05.006 --> 35:07.241
<i>I took that picture.</i>

35:08.376 --> 35:10.276
<i>Your mom was ten-years-old</i>

35:10.344 --> 35:14.314
and Kindling was her
all time favourite pony.

35:26.779 --> 35:27.410
Hey...

35:28.169 --> 35:30.072
Hey... how're you doing?
How'd you sleep?

35:30.859 --> 35:32.293
Fine,

35:32.360 --> 35:34.495
but I can't drive
anywhere though.

35:34.563 --> 35:35.730
That's 'cause
the doctors said

35:35.798 --> 35:37.665
you're supposed
to take it easy.

35:37.733 --> 35:40.233
Ty, something happened
to me yesterday.

35:40.301 --> 35:42.135
Yeah, you bonked your head
pretty hard, Amy.

35:42.203 --> 35:44.404
No, not just that.

35:47.641 --> 35:48.809
(Slams door)

35:49.610 --> 35:51.745
You know, I realized
what was important.

35:51.813 --> 35:53.246
It's like you said
about my mom;

35:53.314 --> 35:55.948
That she wasn't about
deadlines and money

35:56.016 --> 35:57.817
and reputation.

36:00.687 --> 36:02.588
Come on, I need you
to drop me off.

36:02.655 --> 36:05.024
There's somewhere
I've got to be.

36:09.562 --> 36:11.495
You know, I think
Amy must have seen

36:11.563 --> 36:13.331
that picture of mom.

36:13.398 --> 36:16.534
Well, that's...
that's one explanation.

36:19.404 --> 36:21.606
What have you done
to my coffee?

36:21.673 --> 36:23.541
I bought in bulk;
It's much cheaper.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.844
Oh, Lou, now you're messing
with my coffee.

36:25.911 --> 36:27.144
Because I've seen
that picture,

36:27.212 --> 36:28.511
and I mean there's
lots more pictures

36:28.579 --> 36:30.313
of mom with Kindling.

36:31.249 --> 36:33.350
I mean, come on, grandpa,
you don't think that...

36:33.417 --> 36:36.186
Mom was...
I mean, there...

36:36.254 --> 36:37.487
With her pony.

36:40.725 --> 36:43.993
You know,
I've lived long enough

36:44.061 --> 36:47.429
to learn that we don't go
through this life alone.

36:47.497 --> 36:51.467
And well,
it... comforts me

36:51.534 --> 36:52.969
to think that Marion

36:53.036 --> 36:55.805
is still part of the lives
of the people she loved.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.607
(Exhales) Oh, grandpa.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.009
You know...

37:03.512 --> 37:04.612
You know, especially now,

37:04.680 --> 37:07.149
I think about mom
all the time.

37:07.216 --> 37:08.917
Well, so do I.

37:12.922 --> 37:14.222
Soraya:
I don't get it.

37:14.290 --> 37:15.256
The bits have been
flying off the shelves.

37:15.323 --> 37:16.723
Chase:
Yeah. That's the problem.

37:16.792 --> 37:18.358
My lawyer's told me
to pull the bits.

37:18.426 --> 37:20.560
Stewart Forrest's lawyers
are gonna be looking at my DVDs,

37:20.628 --> 37:21.896
my product line,

37:21.963 --> 37:23.864
trying to poke holes in everything
I do. It's too risky.

37:23.932 --> 37:25.299
Okay, well,
not that it matters,

37:25.366 --> 37:26.934
but it looks a lot worse
you leaving Amy out to dry

37:27.002 --> 37:29.003
than to take a risk
and help your friend.

37:29.070 --> 37:31.037
Look... It's nothing personal.

37:31.105 --> 37:34.140
I just can't afford to have my name
my name associated with hers right now.

37:35.109 --> 37:36.843
What happened
to Chase'n'Amy?

37:36.911 --> 37:37.911
'Cause back then,

37:37.978 --> 37:39.244
you couldn't do enough
for her.

37:39.312 --> 37:40.578
Why is this coming up now?

37:40.646 --> 37:41.947
It's ancient history.

37:42.015 --> 37:44.716
It's still pretty fresh
in my mind.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.618
Okay, yes, I had a thing
for Amy once,

37:46.686 --> 37:48.453
but that was before
I got a chance to know you.

37:48.521 --> 37:49.788
You know, I wish
I could believe you,

37:49.856 --> 37:51.990
but the more I think
about it, I just...

37:52.058 --> 37:54.259
I'm tired of being
Chase Powers' second choice.

37:54.327 --> 37:55.659
You're breaking up with me?

37:55.727 --> 37:57.829
What about the merchandise?

37:58.763 --> 37:59.964
Chase: Hey!
You're gonna have to pay for that.

38:00.032 --> 38:02.099
Soraya:
Yeah? So sue me!

38:03.135 --> 38:06.037
Chase: Where're you goin' with that?!
Hey!

38:06.104 --> 38:07.138
(Door slams)

38:15.213 --> 38:16.279
Riana?

38:17.715 --> 38:18.815
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:20.617 --> 38:23.053
Guess you're looking
for my dad.

38:23.120 --> 38:25.388
I'm sorry he was so rude
to your sister.

38:25.456 --> 38:27.857
Lou can take care
of herself.

38:27.924 --> 38:31.160
But actually,
I came to talk to you.

38:31.228 --> 38:32.194
Okay.

38:32.262 --> 38:33.262
I just want you to know

38:33.330 --> 38:35.231
that we can still
work together.

38:35.298 --> 38:36.732
- Really?
= Yeah.

38:36.799 --> 38:39.068
And it doesn't have to be
about show jumping

38:39.135 --> 38:40.069
or competition.

38:40.136 --> 38:41.270
Any time you wanna ride,

38:41.338 --> 38:43.537
you can just come over
and ride with me.

38:43.605 --> 38:47.242
Yeah, I guess...
If my dad ever backs off.

38:48.210 --> 38:51.346
(Sighs) It's so not fair
what he's doing.

38:51.413 --> 38:53.915
I made sure Lou saw Addison.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.183
You can see him too.

38:55.251 --> 38:56.817
You can even ride him
if you want.

38:56.886 --> 38:58.853
Riana, he's your horse.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.188
The whole reason
we started this

39:01.256 --> 39:05.058
was so that you could be
the one who would ride him.

39:05.126 --> 39:06.193
(Exhales)

39:08.429 --> 39:10.797
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Now, this is
something</i> <i>my mom used to do.</i>

39:10.865 --> 39:12.299
You take away the saddle,

39:12.367 --> 39:13.933
and you can begin to build
an honest relationship

39:13.934 --> 39:15.101
with your horse.

39:15.168 --> 39:17.003
It's kind of scary.

39:17.070 --> 39:18.771
Not when you have a bond.

39:18.838 --> 39:21.774
<i>You trust him</i>
<i>and he trusts you.</i>

39:21.841 --> 39:24.110
Okay, I want you to pick up
a nice, easy canter.

39:39.491 --> 39:41.726
Now, when you're ready,
I want you to take the jumps.

39:58.443 --> 40:00.477
I feel like I'm flying.

40:01.413 --> 40:03.079
This is great, Amy.

40:16.622 --> 40:17.955
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>So what's going on, man?</i>

40:18.023 --> 40:20.158
(Loud hammering)

40:20.225 --> 40:22.626
I talked to Ashley
last night.

40:22.693 --> 40:24.327
Suppose to be coming home
in a couple of days,

40:24.395 --> 40:27.730
but now she wants to stay
for another week or so.

40:27.798 --> 40:29.098
Well, I guess there's more
to see in Italy.

40:29.167 --> 40:31.468
Well, that's what she said.

40:31.536 --> 40:33.102
So what's the problem?

40:33.171 --> 40:34.971
I don't know, maybe nothing.

40:35.039 --> 40:36.506
But if you saw the way

40:36.574 --> 40:38.607
Ashley took to those
fancy hotels in Rome

40:38.675 --> 40:40.442
and hanging out
with this Marco guy

40:40.510 --> 40:43.512
and his rich family
in Tuscany...

40:43.580 --> 40:44.780
When it came time
to come home,

40:44.847 --> 40:46.748
and she wanted
to stay longer...

40:46.816 --> 40:48.651
What could I say?

40:48.718 --> 40:50.619
Well, what did you say?

40:50.687 --> 40:52.588
I said there was only
so much Linguini vongole

40:52.656 --> 40:54.389
a cowboy could eat.
(Laughs)

40:54.456 --> 40:56.691
(Chuckles)
That's probably true.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.626
Seriously though,

40:58.694 --> 40:59.694
have you ever heard
of a bride

40:59.761 --> 41:00.861
not coming back
on her honeymoon

41:00.929 --> 41:03.097
with her husband?

41:04.032 --> 41:04.965
Well, there was
this movie once

41:05.033 --> 41:06.534
about a honeymoon killer.

41:06.602 --> 41:08.236
None of his wives
ever came back.

41:08.304 --> 41:09.603
(Laughing)

41:09.671 --> 41:12.772
It'll be fine, man.
She's with her mom.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.274
It's only for another week,
right?

41:16.811 --> 41:19.012
(Sighs)
I suppose you're right.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.880
It'll be fine.

41:25.419 --> 41:26.619
(Feed rustles)

41:31.391 --> 41:34.760
Stewart,
what are you doing here?

41:34.828 --> 41:36.061
My daughter told me

41:36.129 --> 41:39.965
she would never
get on a horse again,

41:40.033 --> 41:43.602
and then I saw her
working with you.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.970
So you were there?

41:46.038 --> 41:48.973
She was relaxed,
she was happy,

41:49.041 --> 41:50.208
she was making
real progress.

41:50.276 --> 41:53.044
And then I realized
why I'd hired you

41:53.112 --> 41:54.746
in the first place...

41:56.749 --> 41:59.950
abd that maybe I was
the problem all along.

42:02.287 --> 42:05.756
Lou:So what are you going to do
to make this right, Stewart?

42:08.526 --> 42:09.926
(Sighs) Well,

42:09.994 --> 42:12.463
I suppose I could call
my lawyers, but...

42:15.399 --> 42:16.966
Let's make this simple.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.100
(Paper rips)

42:27.678 --> 42:28.745
(Relieved exhale)

42:31.814 --> 42:32.881
(Laughs)

42:34.284 --> 42:36.918
Jack:
So dropped the lawsuit, huh?

42:36.986 --> 42:39.187
Guess you can be
pretty persuasive after all.

42:39.255 --> 42:40.289
Mm-hm.

42:40.356 --> 42:43.191
Even at this delicate time.

42:43.259 --> 42:44.593
You know,
when Lyndy called me

42:44.661 --> 42:46.661
to tell me she was pregnant,

42:46.728 --> 42:49.196
I was stuck in
some crummy motel,

42:49.264 --> 42:50.498
living on day money.

42:50.565 --> 42:52.232
I could barely afford the gas

42:52.301 --> 42:55.736
to get from one rodeo
to the next.

42:55.804 --> 42:58.706
And I tried to be real upbeat
on the phone, but...

42:58.774 --> 43:00.174
Boy, I couldn't
help thinking

43:00.241 --> 43:03.209
that this could not have
happened at a worse time.

43:03.277 --> 43:05.545
I know what you're trying
to say, grandpa;

43:05.613 --> 43:08.247
There is no good time
to have a baby.

43:08.316 --> 43:10.216
No. No, Lou.

43:10.284 --> 43:12.852
What I'm trying to say is,

43:12.920 --> 43:17.056
that for two people in love,
like you and Peter,

43:17.124 --> 43:19.391
there's no bad time.

43:20.293 --> 43:21.560
(Chuckles)

43:21.628 --> 43:24.596
'Cause all the small stuff,
well...

43:24.664 --> 43:26.365
It just takes care of itself.

43:29.336 --> 43:31.136
How about some coffee,
old man?

43:31.204 --> 43:33.205
I'll even splurge
on the good stuff.

43:33.272 --> 43:36.240
Ooh! I wouldn't say no
to that.
