WEBVTT

00:00.093 --> 00:01.706
Hey, do you still need that loan?

00:01.779 --> 00:02.711
I'm late, what, two payments?

00:02.782 --> 00:05.296
I always wanted to screw the I.R.S.

00:05.364 --> 00:10.307
But that was not a $457,000
screw. I will get the money.

00:10.375 --> 00:11.709
Jail is always an option.

00:11.777 --> 00:13.980
I need your signature. I want to
take out a loan against the business.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.717
No, no, no. No way.

00:16.786 --> 00:18.554
Everything seems to be in order.

00:18.622 --> 00:23.060
Don't need the loan anymore,
buddy boy. I got an extension.

00:23.128 --> 00:24.596
This is really bad.

00:24.663 --> 00:26.298
How come I don't feel guilty?

00:26.366 --> 00:28.568
We need to stop doing this.

00:28.636 --> 00:30.438
You're not going back to him, are you?

00:30.505 --> 00:31.339
He's my husband.

00:31.407 --> 00:32.641
So you deserve better.

00:32.708 --> 00:34.610
You won't ever make me happy.

00:34.677 --> 00:37.680
We've hit a rough patch. You
don't break up because of it.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.080
He's done with me now.

00:39.148 --> 00:43.852
Good. He's doing you a
favor, Kimber. It's a gift.

00:46.555 --> 00:49.220
Marcy Hamill flat-lined in recovery.

00:49.288 --> 00:51.390
Why do the police have to know?

00:51.458 --> 00:53.829
No way, Christian. We're not
going down that road again.

00:53.896 --> 00:57.836
This time we do it by the book.

01:04.879 --> 01:13.353
It's not like these are things that I don't
like about you. It's just that, you know...

01:13.420 --> 01:16.584
I mean, there comes a point

01:16.651 --> 01:20.554
where the... the lack of
attention, you know, doesn't

01:20.622 --> 01:23.624
feel like just some sort of
benign neglect. I mean, I know

01:23.692 --> 01:24.658
all about that. My mother was an

01:24.726 --> 01:30.131
expert, trust me. But it begins
to feel intentional, like he...

01:30.198 --> 01:34.668
Like you want to hurt me. But we
have talked about this 50 times.

01:34.736 --> 01:39.240
Didn't we have the same
conversation two weeks ago?

01:39.307 --> 01:41.342
For God's sake, talk, Ron,

01:41.409 --> 01:44.111
because you know that I'll fill
the silences if you don't, and

01:44.179 --> 01:49.283
it's usually with some stupid
crap. And this is exactly what

01:49.351 --> 01:52.753
the doctor and I are talking
about. You need to start

01:52.821 --> 02:01.895
generating this relationship. Ron?

02:01.963 --> 02:04.898
Anything?

02:04.966 --> 02:05.832
I'm done.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.735
Done talking about this?

02:08.803 --> 02:12.439
Done talking about anything.

02:17.845 --> 02:19.779
What is that?

02:19.847 --> 02:22.649
Divorce papers. I had Eddie
draw them up. I've also

02:22.717 --> 02:24.017
separated our bank accounts and

02:24.084 --> 02:26.819
I'm renting a place down in
the marina for the time being.

02:26.887 --> 02:31.257
Tonya's at our place
now, packing up my things.

02:35.128 --> 02:39.064
Dahlia, this is obviously
very painful to hear.

02:39.132 --> 02:45.537
I think we should, uh, take this slow.

02:45.605 --> 02:47.238
You...

02:47.306 --> 02:50.008
You goddamned asshole!

02:51.210 --> 02:52.210
Damn it!

02:55.981 --> 02:59.215
This is why I did this here!

02:59.283 --> 03:00.817
I knew you couldn't handle it!

03:00.885 --> 03:01.918
She's unstable.

03:01.986 --> 03:04.587
Handle it?!

03:04.655 --> 03:13.195
We have been married for 20 years! What
did you expect me to do, thank you?!

03:17.233 --> 03:22.270
Oh, it's Tonya. You're
screwing your secretary?

03:22.338 --> 03:25.607
It's not Tonya.

03:25.674 --> 03:27.675
It's you.

03:27.743 --> 03:30.344
It's all about you, Dahlia.

03:30.412 --> 03:36.083
You're passive-aggressive
and cruel and diminishing.

03:36.151 --> 03:38.685
But this... this therapy.

03:38.753 --> 03:44.624
We came here to save our
relationship, our 20-year marriage.

03:44.692 --> 03:48.494
Stop with the 20 years, as
if it's some endurance sport!

03:48.562 --> 03:50.930
Therapy didn't save us, Dahlia.

03:50.998 --> 03:57.669
It only made me realize how little
there is for me here with you.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.615 --> 04:18.521
You prick. I'm gonna take everything. He has a little
dick. It's about the size of a goddamned grain of rice.

04:18.589 --> 04:21.690
We're both to blame for this.

04:21.757 --> 04:23.292
Where are you going?

04:23.359 --> 04:26.027
Wherever I want.

04:37.572 --> 04:42.442
Dr. Troy, Dr. McNamara,
I'm ready for you now.

04:42.443 --> 04:53.443
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

05:30.031 --> 05:31.598
So, uh, what's their story?

05:32.066 --> 05:35.533
Oh, I can't really talk about that.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.536
We understand. We're doctors,
too. Plastic surgeons.

05:39.604 --> 05:40.704
Ahem.

05:40.772 --> 05:42.906
Not like we're a couple or anything.

05:42.973 --> 05:47.142
My practice specializes in
couple and group therapy. That

05:47.210 --> 05:49.578
can mean husbands and wives,

05:49.646 --> 05:53.448
lovers, brothers and sisters,
or people in a professional

05:53.515 --> 05:56.917
relationship. You'd be surprised
how many business partners

05:56.985 --> 06:01.154
I see. So how long have you
two been working together?

06:01.221 --> 06:02.555
20 years.

06:02.622 --> 06:06.124
Is that long? I mean,
compared to your other clients?

06:06.192 --> 06:09.527
Why did you decide you
suddenly needed therapy?

06:09.595 --> 06:15.165
You must know each other very well.
Probably become pretty adept at self-solving.

06:15.233 --> 06:19.536
We've had our fights, just
like anybody else, you know,

06:19.604 --> 06:20.871
but we manage to work them out.

06:20.939 --> 06:24.340
Frankly, I think we could fix
this with a week in Cabo, but he

06:24.408 --> 06:28.209
thinks our money's
better spent, uh, on you.

06:28.277 --> 06:29.610
Now why did you think that,

06:29.678 --> 06:33.313
Dr. McNamara? Are things
the worst they've ever been?

06:33.381 --> 06:35.448
No.

06:35.516 --> 06:39.318
He was married to this
woman. Her name's Julia. They

06:39.385 --> 06:40.586
had a son together... Matt.

06:40.653 --> 06:44.526
A few years ago, we found out
that Matt was actually my son, and

06:44.594 --> 06:47.195
he decided to beat the shit
out of me in the scrub room.

06:47.263 --> 06:50.798
I think that was the worst.

06:53.835 --> 06:57.871
Usually, when couples seek therapy,

06:57.938 --> 07:01.309
it's when things are at their
bleakest, when all hope seems

07:01.376 --> 07:06.681
lost. Is that the way
you feel, Dr. McNamara?

07:06.749 --> 07:08.282
Sometimes.

07:08.350 --> 07:14.121
I don't. I want things to go back to
exactly the way they were before. I love him.

07:14.189 --> 07:15.455
I miss him.

07:15.523 --> 07:17.290
Do you love Dr. Troy?

07:17.358 --> 07:23.363
I do. He's like the brother I never had.

07:23.431 --> 07:25.531
Sometimes family can be very

07:25.599 --> 07:29.935
difficult. When we describe
a friend as a family member,

07:30.003 --> 07:33.472
sometimes we're saying we love
them in spite of themselves,

07:33.539 --> 07:36.874
that we have no choice but to love them.

07:36.942 --> 07:41.245
Do you feel you have a
choice to love Dr. Troy?

07:41.313 --> 07:42.213
Of course I do.

07:43.949 --> 07:48.185
I want to try an exercise with you.

07:52.256 --> 08:02.497
I want you to draw your families. Doesn't have
to be a Degas. Just draw whatever you feel.

08:02.564 --> 08:05.199
Thank you.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.768
Ahem.

08:15.275 --> 08:22.047
Christian that's, uh, Sean and that's me.

08:22.114 --> 08:23.915
That's it? Where are your kids?

08:23.983 --> 08:25.616
I don't know. Sleeping in another room.

08:25.684 --> 08:26.584
Well, that's not your family.

08:26.652 --> 08:27.718
Hey, don't judge my picture.

08:27.786 --> 08:32.688
Let's see yours.

08:32.756 --> 08:34.557
Is that your wife and children?

08:34.625 --> 08:35.491
Yes.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.625
They don't live with you?

08:36.693 --> 08:39.962
No, they live with her in
New York. How'd you know that?

08:40.029 --> 08:42.797
Everyone's hands are
touching except yours.

08:42.865 --> 08:45.299
You put your ex-wife in your
picture, but you didn't put me in it.

08:45.367 --> 08:46.867
Now you're judging my picture.

08:46.935 --> 08:47.935
I'm just saying.

08:48.002 --> 08:50.369
It is interesting that a
few minutes ago you described

08:50.437 --> 08:55.841
Dr. Troy as your brother, then you neglected
to include him in your family portrait.

08:55.909 --> 09:00.578
Well, a few months ago, I
probably would have included him.

09:00.646 --> 09:03.881
What's happened? Certainly
nothing worse than discovering

09:03.949 --> 09:08.952
he, uh, fathered your firstborn.

09:11.488 --> 09:14.523
It's nothing big or specific
like that. I just feel worn down

09:14.591 --> 09:19.593
by him. He sucks all the air
out of the room. He's, uh...

09:19.661 --> 09:21.628
How do I put this delicately?

09:21.696 --> 09:23.729
Christian is not a good person.

09:23.797 --> 09:24.697
Very delicate.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.132
You know, you have your
moral code, but let's face it.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.235
You're willing to do some pretty horrible
things in the name of self-interest.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.169
You know, if we're talking

09:31.237 --> 09:32.037
about the same things, then you

09:32.104 --> 09:33.672
were right alongside me. I'm
just not ashamed of myself.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.242
All right. I never would have done
those things if you weren't in my life.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.109
Heh heh!

09:37.177 --> 09:38.844
We have this joke that our
offices are built over the

09:38.912 --> 09:41.646
mouth of hell. Well, if
that's true, he's the devil.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.348
Do you have any idea how boring
your life would be if I wasn't in it?

09:44.416 --> 09:46.951
This is what you do. You
diminish me so that I need you.

09:47.018 --> 09:48.919
Is this why we're giving
this guy 250 an hour, huh? So

09:48.987 --> 09:50.153
you can play the victim? I mean,

09:50.221 --> 09:51.921
seriously, talk about sucking
the life out of somebody.

09:51.989 --> 09:52.856
I mean, how long are you going

09:52.923 --> 09:54.590
to keep blaming me for how
much you hate your life?

09:54.658 --> 09:55.524
Let's slow down for a sec...

09:55.592 --> 09:57.126
No, no, no. I don't want
to slow down. I want to know

09:57.193 --> 09:58.727
something first. Why didn't
you put me in your picture?

09:58.795 --> 09:59.528
I told you.

09:59.596 --> 10:01.196
No, you didn't tell me. What
happened a few months ago?

10:01.264 --> 10:03.031
Nothing. That's the point.

10:03.098 --> 10:05.132
This relationship never changes.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.767
I'm just waking up to the fact

10:06.835 --> 10:10.537
that it doesn't work,
that maybe it never worked.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.743
You guys up for another exercise?

10:18.678 --> 10:20.311
What is this, pre-school?

10:20.379 --> 10:23.314
You're both highly
intelligent, educated men.

10:23.382 --> 10:24.548
Sometimes I have to trick people

10:24.616 --> 10:27.584
like you. No, check that. You
have to trick yourselves into

10:27.652 --> 10:33.222
getting past your really good
bullshit. You have 15 seconds.

10:33.290 --> 10:39.428
Write down every word you can
think of to describe your partner.

10:39.495 --> 10:41.830
Go.

10:48.969 --> 10:51.537
Ok, time's up.

10:51.605 --> 10:56.308
Dr. McNamara, this time you go first.

10:56.375 --> 11:01.379
"Tall, arrogant, peacock,
womanizer, clothes whore,

11:01.446 --> 11:07.684
surgeon, damaged, dangerous, asshole."

11:07.752 --> 11:11.520
Dr. Troy, any thoughts?

11:11.588 --> 11:15.457
Uh, hard to argue with any of those.

11:15.525 --> 11:18.193
What about yours?

11:25.566 --> 11:26.433
What?

11:26.501 --> 11:28.935
You think Dr. McNamara
has a drinking problem?

11:29.003 --> 11:30.670
No, but I think he's an alcoholic.

11:30.738 --> 11:31.604
What's the difference?

11:31.672 --> 11:32.705
The difference is people with

11:32.773 --> 11:35.274
drinking problems can't
stop drinking. You abuse it.

11:35.341 --> 11:36.775
You self-medicate.

11:36.843 --> 11:38.643
When was the last time you had a drink?

11:38.711 --> 11:40.545
Heh! Before he came in here.

11:40.613 --> 11:41.579
I could smell it on his breath

11:41.647 --> 11:42.480
on the way over. He keeps a

11:42.547 --> 11:45.349
bottle of vodka under his fish tank.

11:45.416 --> 11:47.017
Are you accusing me of
drinking before surgery?

11:47.084 --> 11:49.385
No, but after.

11:52.856 --> 11:55.024
We deal in micro-millimeters

11:55.091 --> 11:57.125
over the course of 6 to 8 hours.

11:57.193 --> 11:59.928
It's very hard to let go
after something like that.

11:59.995 --> 12:01.963
Not all surgeons drink.

12:02.031 --> 12:03.397
No. Some take pills. Some

12:03.465 --> 12:05.866
screw the girls who water the ficus plant.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.536
You know, it's not just
the drinking. You behave

12:09.603 --> 12:12.839
like an alcoholic, ok? You act
out and then you'll apologize,

12:12.906 --> 12:16.275
and you expect everybody to forgive you.

12:16.342 --> 12:17.976
He doesn't take responsibility

12:18.044 --> 12:22.246
for anything in his life. Julia
is a crazy dyke, Matt's got my

12:22.314 --> 12:27.217
genes, I'm the devil, as you just heard.

12:27.285 --> 12:31.153
The one common thread
in all of this... is you.

12:31.221 --> 12:32.154
You need me.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.823
No, I don't need you. I'm a
hell of a surgeon myself, ok?

12:34.891 --> 12:38.293
The only reason I'm with him is
because I choose to be with him.

12:42.964 --> 12:47.534
Why? Sometimes the fastest
way to get to the truth is to

12:47.602 --> 12:49.769
ask the simplest questions.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.805
Why do you stay together?

12:52.873 --> 12:57.142
Is it money? Loyalty? Habit?

12:57.209 --> 12:59.510
No, no, no. That's not my
style. I know when the party's

12:59.578 --> 13:01.479
over an hour before everybody else does.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.147
Then why?

13:04.215 --> 13:07.684
We're a good team. Sean's a
hell of a surgeon, you know?

13:07.752 --> 13:10.086
I'm... I'm inspired by him.

13:10.154 --> 13:12.855
Are you inspired by Dr. Troy?

13:12.923 --> 13:14.323
Not really.

13:14.391 --> 13:15.391
Hmmh!

13:15.458 --> 13:18.260
You know, sometimes there are
things that I envy about him,

13:18.327 --> 13:23.130
all the women, but whenever
I try those things, I see how

13:23.198 --> 13:25.099
empty they are and that really

13:25.166 --> 13:27.067
he's just searching for
something I already have.

13:27.135 --> 13:28.235
And what's that?

13:28.302 --> 13:31.104
Well, a center, a purpose.

13:31.172 --> 13:33.072
And what purpose is that?

13:33.140 --> 13:34.340
Yeah, I want to hear this.

13:34.408 --> 13:38.276
To help people, to be a doctor, to heal.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.746
That is such bullshit. He wants

13:41.814 --> 13:43.581
the babes and the booze just as

13:43.649 --> 13:45.983
much, if not more, than I do.

13:46.051 --> 13:49.853
It is kind of interesting that
you would have that purpose

13:49.921 --> 13:52.922
and yet choose to be a cosmetic surgeon.

13:52.990 --> 13:53.923
Believe me, I've had some

13:53.991 --> 13:56.259
serious doubts about that decision lately.

13:56.326 --> 13:58.727
Here we go again. He's been singing
the same tune for the last 20 years.

13:58.795 --> 14:00.262
Well, maybe this time it's different.

14:00.329 --> 14:01.062
It isn't.

14:01.130 --> 14:01.897
Now, this is what he does.

14:01.964 --> 14:04.499
He says he accepts me for who
I am, then the second I try to

14:04.566 --> 14:07.301
set some boundaries between
us, he yanks me right back in.

14:07.369 --> 14:10.270
Do you have boundary issues, Dr. Troy?

14:10.338 --> 14:12.239
When we lived together, he
thought nothing of coming into

14:12.307 --> 14:14.774
my room at any hour just
because he felt like talking.

14:14.842 --> 14:15.608
Is it wrong to want to shoot

14:15.676 --> 14:16.509
the shit with your best friend?

14:16.577 --> 14:17.477
My door was closed.

14:17.544 --> 14:18.344
Just answer me. Is it?

14:18.412 --> 14:19.979
You're invading my private space.

14:20.046 --> 14:22.247
I always check to make sure
he's not jerking off or whatever.

14:22.315 --> 14:25.283
All his homes have very few
walls. It's like he needs to see

14:25.351 --> 14:27.619
you all the time to make sure
you're still there. I assume

14:27.686 --> 14:33.824
it's because he was brought up in
foster care, but it's exhausting!

14:33.892 --> 14:37.427
But you must have liked
being needed in that way,

14:37.495 --> 14:40.263
Dr. McNamara. I mean, to be in

14:40.331 --> 14:44.266
a relationship with someone
so specifically needy.

14:44.334 --> 14:46.835
You keep asking about the
past, but can't people change?

14:46.903 --> 14:49.270
Can't I wake up one day and
realize I don't want to be that

14:49.338 --> 14:51.639
person anymore and I'm just done?

14:51.707 --> 14:52.907
What do you mean, done?

14:52.974 --> 14:54.074
Aren't we gonna save this?

14:54.142 --> 14:56.376
Well, you might be.

14:56.444 --> 14:59.479
I'm here to end it.

15:06.486 --> 15:09.053
I know what this is about.

15:11.256 --> 15:13.591
The princess and the pea.

15:13.658 --> 15:14.858
Remember that story about the

15:14.926 --> 15:16.693
chick who, uh, could feel a pea

15:16.761 --> 15:17.961
under all those mattresses?

15:18.029 --> 15:19.095
You're saying I'm a princess?

15:19.163 --> 15:26.469
No. We are. Our relationship is. The one
thing that screws us up is, uh... secrets.

15:26.536 --> 15:29.071
That's our pea.

15:29.139 --> 15:32.607
I don't have a secret.

15:32.675 --> 15:36.243
No, but I do.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.479
And it's kind of...

15:38.546 --> 15:41.882
I hate lying to you.

15:41.949 --> 15:45.852
What did you do?

15:45.919 --> 15:48.621
It's funny because at the end
of the day, it's really no big

15:48.688 --> 15:50.722
deal, but... you remember a while

15:50.790 --> 15:52.591
ago, when I was having some tax

15:52.658 --> 15:54.959
problems and I wanted to take
out a loan against the business?

15:55.027 --> 15:55.960
And I said no.

15:56.028 --> 15:57.094
Well, I did it anyway.

15:57.162 --> 15:58.095
I was desperate.

15:58.163 --> 16:01.131
How? You needed my signature on the forms.

16:01.199 --> 16:04.768
I forged it.

16:04.835 --> 16:06.603
You risked everything?

16:06.670 --> 16:09.105
20 years of my hard work?

16:09.172 --> 16:10.406
I could have lost it all!

16:10.473 --> 16:14.042
Look, I know it was
wrong and I should have...

16:16.378 --> 16:18.813
Thank you, doctor. I wanted

16:18.880 --> 16:22.916
out of this, but now I can
leave with a clear conscience.

16:22.984 --> 16:27.987
Any contact you want with me
should be through my lawyer.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.303
Relax, ok? He's gonna show up.

16:38.371 --> 16:40.538
He's probably having too much
fun jerking off imagining all

16:40.606 --> 16:42.972
the ways that I've screwed him.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.740
Look, I wouldn't have agreed

16:44.808 --> 16:47.208
to come here if he had
objected, which he didn't.

16:47.276 --> 16:48.175
You left him a message.

16:48.243 --> 16:50.444
He texted you back, saying, "whatever."

16:50.511 --> 16:51.811
He could have said no.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.881
Lizzie, I love you, but you
might not be as huge a draw as

16:54.949 --> 16:57.050
you think you are. The guy's
been missing in action for a

16:57.117 --> 17:00.152
week. I had to reschedule 9
surgeries. "Sorry, Mr. Ortiz.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.155
You'll have to live another
week with that honkin' schnoz of

17:02.223 --> 17:05.491
yours because Dr. McNamara's
at home, festering."

17:05.559 --> 17:06.659
And what are you doing now?

17:06.727 --> 17:08.260
I'm expressing my anger, ok?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.596
I'm not some baby pouting in his shit.

17:10.663 --> 17:15.633
No, you're having a tantrum and you're
throwing it all against the walls.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.809
Hey. Thanks for doing this.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.345
Back at ya.

17:32.249 --> 17:33.846
I'm glad you came, too.

17:33.914 --> 17:35.379
I figure if I'm gonna sue

17:35.447 --> 17:41.185
you, I should tell you in person.

17:41.252 --> 17:46.190
So, last week ended on quite a note.

17:46.258 --> 17:48.692
Here, Sean.

17:48.759 --> 17:50.026
I'm not interested in what

17:50.094 --> 17:51.893
you have to say. Save it for your lawyer.

17:51.961 --> 17:54.495
Just take it.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.999
$256,000?

18:00.067 --> 18:03.368
I told you I was temporarily
cash-poor. It was an emergency.

18:03.436 --> 18:06.738
I'm paying you back, with interest.

18:06.806 --> 18:09.273
What about this strikes
you as funny, Sean?

18:09.341 --> 18:13.411
Oh, it's just so classic,
you know? He totals your life

18:13.479 --> 18:17.714
and then offers to pay for the
repairs. Money fixes everything.

18:17.781 --> 18:21.116
Saves him the trouble
of having a conscience.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.351
And he's a prick.

18:23.720 --> 18:26.253
Was this check intended to fix everything?

18:26.321 --> 18:27.788
Look, what I did was wrong.

18:27.855 --> 18:30.324
I know that, and I understand
if he's pissed or upset or...

18:30.392 --> 18:34.027
Wait. He can cry real tears,
too, ok? Everything he does,

18:34.095 --> 18:37.630
everything he says is about
getting what he needs, power

18:37.698 --> 18:42.835
and money, and it doesn't matter
who he hurts or cheats or kills.

18:46.338 --> 18:52.876
So you... think Christian
is capable of killing you?

18:52.944 --> 18:58.114
Jesus, Sean. You really do need
help. Are you really that paranoid?

18:58.182 --> 19:01.250
Look, I'm just saying he
takes no responsibility for

19:01.318 --> 19:04.219
anything he does because
there's always an easy way out.

19:04.287 --> 19:05.687
He married Liz when he thought

19:05.755 --> 19:08.657
he was dying and needed a
baby-sitter for his kids. Then,

19:08.724 --> 19:12.360
when he was suddenly healthy,
he dumped her, then tried to pay

19:12.427 --> 19:16.163
her off, as if money would
somehow take away the pain.

19:16.231 --> 19:18.598
Yeah, go ahead. You... you tell him, Liz.

19:18.666 --> 19:21.634
I didn't agree to let Dr.
Cruz join us so that you two

19:21.702 --> 19:24.002
could, uh, play her against each other.

19:24.070 --> 19:27.171
I won't allow you to
put her in the middle.

19:27.239 --> 19:29.940
Thank you.

19:34.511 --> 19:37.746
Dr. Cruz, is there
something you'd like to say?

19:37.814 --> 19:44.355
I guess I just am not used
to feeling so, um, protected.

19:44.423 --> 19:45.591
I was forced to take sides growing up,

19:45.658 --> 19:50.461
and it was a constant
battlefield. It was just...

19:50.529 --> 19:52.395
You don't feel protected at work?

19:52.463 --> 19:53.496
'Course she does.

19:53.564 --> 19:54.830
I'm very protective of Liz.

19:54.898 --> 19:59.500
I was asking Dr. Cruz.

19:59.568 --> 20:05.737
In the beginning... I
felt that, um, Sean and

20:05.805 --> 20:11.581
Christian were family, you know.

20:11.649 --> 20:16.185
But they have been so busy
hating each other, the rest of

20:16.253 --> 20:18.354
us don't even exist, unless to

20:18.422 --> 20:22.690
take sides. It's never about
what we need, about what we

20:22.757 --> 20:26.293
want, about what we deserve for
putting up with your bullshit.

20:26.361 --> 20:29.096
Well, that's unfair, Liz.

20:29.164 --> 20:31.032
You know what's unfair, Sean?

20:31.099 --> 20:34.167
That I've been working at
McNamara/Troy for years, and

20:34.235 --> 20:35.669
neither of you have ever come up

20:35.736 --> 20:38.771
to me and said, "Liz, we'd like
to make you a partner. We would

20:38.839 --> 20:40.039
like for you to have parity with

20:40.106 --> 20:42.908
us because you work so hard,
because you deserve it."

20:42.975 --> 20:47.145
And you know what? It's time, now.

20:47.212 --> 20:51.348
I mean, maybe it's the only way
you two will survive... shaking up

20:51.416 --> 20:57.787
this dysfunctional duo and
making it McNamara, Troy & Cruz.

20:59.423 --> 21:00.322
Lizzie...

21:00.390 --> 21:02.357
Oh, don't, don't. Don't patronize me.

21:02.425 --> 21:05.727
You're right, Liz. We should
have done that a long time ago,

21:05.794 --> 21:09.096
when there still was a
McNamara/Troy for Cruz to join.

21:10.431 --> 21:13.233
I always considered you a partner...

21:13.301 --> 21:14.033
Oh.

21:14.101 --> 21:15.034
In spirit.

21:15.102 --> 21:16.035
Screw you, Christian.

21:16.103 --> 21:17.736
Oh, come on. You're the only
one who can help us figure out

21:17.804 --> 21:19.371
how we got here. Please, ok?

21:19.439 --> 21:20.438
How two brothers could...

21:20.506 --> 21:21.573
Want to kill each other?

21:21.640 --> 21:22.773
Have you read the Bible?

21:22.841 --> 21:26.509
Believe me, we're not the first.

21:26.577 --> 21:31.213
Dr. Cruz, why did you
agree to come here today?

21:31.281 --> 21:37.522
Because I figured that this
would be a safe space to open up

21:37.590 --> 21:41.593
and be honest with them about
how I felt and that maybe, with

21:41.660 --> 21:48.065
a professional present, I could
tell them what self-centered,

21:48.132 --> 21:50.901
egotistical assholes they are.

21:50.968 --> 22:00.409
And... and just... and also that, um...

22:00.477 --> 22:02.544
And what?

22:02.612 --> 22:05.114
That, uh...

22:05.181 --> 22:07.082
That I am pregnant.

22:09.852 --> 22:11.787
So? Congratulations.

22:11.854 --> 22:16.558
You want my permission?

22:16.626 --> 22:20.228
It's Sean's sperm. And you know
what they say... you're only

22:20.296 --> 22:24.532
as sick as your secrets, and I
am up-to-my-ass tired of keeping

22:24.600 --> 22:30.205
everybody else's goddamned
secrets. So I asked Sean and he

22:30.273 --> 22:33.074
- was kind enough to oblige.
- You really think that you

22:33.142 --> 22:35.977
have a better chance of avoiding
birth defects with his splooge?

22:36.045 --> 22:37.745
Well, at least I don't have
to be worried that he's gonna

22:37.813 --> 22:41.015
ask me to get rid of the
child if it isn't perfect.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.049
That wasn't the reason.

22:42.117 --> 22:46.219
No matter what this child is or isn't, I'm
gonna be able to love it because I have that

22:46.287 --> 22:49.656
capacity. That's how you and I
are different, Christian. I can

22:49.723 --> 22:55.594
love a thing for itself,
imperfections and all.

22:58.097 --> 23:00.998
They would be lost
without each other, doctor.

23:01.066 --> 23:03.667
Jesus, Liz. I thought you'd
at least be objective. You know

23:03.735 --> 23:06.670
I'd be better off on my own.

23:06.738 --> 23:11.208
You don't even believe that
you exist without Christian.

23:11.276 --> 23:15.279
You can't tell who you are, how
you're doing, what you're worth

23:15.347 --> 23:19.149
without comparing yourself to
him. The rest of us, what are

23:19.217 --> 23:20.783
we? We're just elevator music.

23:20.850 --> 23:23.387
You both deserve each other.

23:23.454 --> 23:28.892
But I'll tell you what you don't
deserve. You don't deserve me.

23:42.241 --> 23:49.048
How do you guys feel about
everything she just said?

23:49.115 --> 23:52.185
So you give Liz your sperm without
telling me? Why would you do that?

23:52.252 --> 23:55.522
She asked. She wants a
family. She is my family.

23:55.589 --> 24:00.361
I thought I could help her and
we... I... you hurt her so much,

24:00.428 --> 24:02.497
I thought it was the least I could do.

24:02.564 --> 24:04.565
You're gonna raise another child?

24:05.467 --> 24:09.937
I signed papers. I have no leg
rights and I am fine with that.

24:15.109 --> 24:17.644
I'm not fine with it.

24:17.712 --> 24:20.213
I screwed up. I gave it to her.

24:20.281 --> 24:22.749
I thought because of her age,
it would never take, but the

24:22.817 --> 24:26.253
drugs and the... oh, Jesus.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.988
What am I gonna do?

24:28.056 --> 24:29.723
I don't want another kid.

24:29.791 --> 24:32.859
I just wanted her to be happy.

24:32.927 --> 24:36.196
Anything else you're hiding?

24:36.263 --> 24:38.731
At least I paid back what I borrowed.

24:38.799 --> 24:41.034
Stole, embezzled, not borrowed.

24:41.101 --> 24:45.037
But I'm squeaky clean now, aren't I?

24:45.105 --> 24:49.307
Anything else you're keeping from me?

24:53.745 --> 24:59.616
I'm afraid we'll have to stop.
That's all we have time for today.

24:59.684 --> 25:03.887
You're shittin' me.

25:03.954 --> 25:06.889
Here.

25:06.957 --> 25:10.793
For a double session.

25:10.861 --> 25:12.962
Keep the change.

25:13.030 --> 25:15.064
I have another patient.

25:15.132 --> 25:21.037
I'll pay for their makeup session,
too. You can keep that change as well.

25:21.105 --> 25:24.174
Maybe Dr. Griffin would like
a prostitute. Worked so well

25:24.241 --> 25:26.476
with me. Remember when you got Matt one?

25:26.544 --> 25:28.244
Look, I'm sure you have
patients who sometimes need

25:28.312 --> 25:31.314
extra time, so you figure things
out so they can continue. You

25:31.382 --> 25:33.149
know, I'm a doctor. I know how this works.

25:33.217 --> 25:35.585
Your hour is over, Dr. Troy.

25:35.652 --> 25:38.054
I can see you and Dr. McNamara

25:38.121 --> 25:40.323
next week at the same time if you'd like.

25:40.390 --> 25:44.975
If I'd like? What I'd like to
do is stick my shiny, pointy

25:44.976 --> 25:50.465
shoe up your smug, enlightened
ass. That's what I'd like to do.

25:50.533 --> 25:54.201
And you, buddy boy? You can
sue me as much as you want.

25:54.269 --> 25:56.170
You hurt me, you hurt yourself.

25:56.237 --> 26:04.945
And remember... I know where
all the bodies are buried.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.489
Wow.

26:15.557 --> 26:20.894
Thank you, doctor. Now that
you've seen Christian Troy in

26:20.961 --> 26:27.830
action, is there really any
point in another session?

26:27.897 --> 26:31.095
I'll be with you in a minute.

26:42.569 --> 26:44.432
It's going straight to voice mail.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.598
You didn't leave a message?

26:45.664 --> 26:46.695
Well, he's 20 minutes late.

26:46.763 --> 26:48.329
What am I gonna say to him, "hurry up"?

26:48.397 --> 26:52.264
I'll call. Sometimes when he sees
your number, he doesn't answer.

26:52.332 --> 26:53.332
So now it's my fault?

26:53.400 --> 26:54.433
Oh, I don't know. Maybe you

26:54.501 --> 26:56.403
gave him the wrong
address, the wrong time.

26:56.471 --> 26:58.173
Is this typical behavior?

26:58.241 --> 27:01.211
For Matt, yes. He's made a
career out of being irresponsible.

27:01.279 --> 27:02.881
I mean for the two of you.

27:02.949 --> 27:06.484
You're very divided on how to
deal with your son right now.

27:06.551 --> 27:08.152
Is that usually the case?

27:08.219 --> 27:11.022
Usually Christian will
berate him or put him down.

27:11.090 --> 27:12.891
If he could do something I
could be proud of every once

27:12.959 --> 27:14.794
in a while, then it'd
be different, you know?

27:14.862 --> 27:18.598
This is good. This is
important. The main reason we

27:18.666 --> 27:22.702
invited your son here is to
observe how your co-parenting

27:22.770 --> 27:26.341
has become one of your core
issues. It's a chance to work

27:26.408 --> 27:30.279
on it. Sean, uh, is there
anything that Christian has done

27:30.346 --> 27:34.649
for Matt as a father
that you do appreciate?

27:34.717 --> 27:36.484
How about you, Christian?

27:36.552 --> 27:38.153
Have you ever thanked Sean for

27:38.221 --> 27:42.826
raising your son all those years?

27:42.894 --> 27:47.130
Perhaps you should. A lot of
times, when we focus on what's

27:47.198 --> 27:50.535
good instead of what's wrong,
we can change our response to

27:50.602 --> 27:56.041
the situation and then to
each other. Can we try that?

27:56.109 --> 27:58.610
Sure.

28:00.546 --> 28:05.619
I appreciate the, um, the way
that you raised Matt over all

28:05.687 --> 28:09.689
those years, and I think
you did a great job.

28:09.757 --> 28:12.760
And I think you do the
best you can with him...

28:12.828 --> 28:16.232
When you want to.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.003
Oh, Matty, come on in.

28:21.071 --> 28:22.304
You're only a half-hour late.

28:22.372 --> 28:26.074
We tried calling. Why didn't you answer?

28:28.777 --> 28:29.742
Matt, I'm Dr. Griffin.

28:29.810 --> 28:30.876
Thanks for coming.

28:30.943 --> 28:31.942
Pleasure.

28:32.010 --> 28:32.842
And this is?

28:32.910 --> 28:33.842
Uh, Ramona.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.109
It's nice to meet you.

28:35.177 --> 28:38.376
You knew this wasn't a lunch
date. Why'd you bring a girlfriend?

28:38.443 --> 28:43.304
Well, because she's not my
girlfriend anymore. She's my fiancee.

28:43.372 --> 28:45.537
Congratulations. I guess the

28:45.604 --> 28:49.238
next question is, "how far
along are you, sweetie pie?"

28:49.305 --> 28:52.404
You must be Christian. Matt
said that you would be the first

28:52.472 --> 28:54.570
one to say something inappropriate.

28:54.638 --> 28:57.472
Ramona, I'm Sean. It's nice to meet you.

28:57.539 --> 28:58.405
Nice to meet you, too.

28:58.473 --> 29:02.909
But, um... why didn't you let
us know about this earlier?

29:02.977 --> 29:05.912
Well, why? Did I need to
get your approval first?

29:05.980 --> 29:08.114
It would have been better
if we'd met her before.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.583
Yeah, and now you have.

29:10.651 --> 29:12.117
What are you doing, Matt?

29:12.185 --> 29:14.653
You knew this session was
important to us. You had to

29:14.721 --> 29:15.787
spring this on us here, now?

29:15.855 --> 29:16.822
Unfortunately, there wasn't

29:16.890 --> 29:19.426
gonna be a better time. We've
been packing since last week

29:19.493 --> 29:21.094
and we make the move tomorrow.

29:21.161 --> 29:26.033
Ooh, wow. You're moving. Let me
guess. Skid Row has a vacancy?

29:26.101 --> 29:29.670
Matt, uh, since Sean and
Christian invited only you to

29:29.738 --> 29:32.940
join the session, I'll have
to ask Ramona to wait outside.

29:33.007 --> 29:35.276
Well, I'd really like her to
stay, actually, especially since

29:35.343 --> 29:37.411
it might be the last
time they ever see us.

29:37.479 --> 29:39.080
What are you talking about?

29:39.148 --> 29:41.518
Heh heh!

29:41.585 --> 29:43.353
Just like we talked about, baby.

29:43.421 --> 29:44.585
Yeah. Um, you know what?

29:44.651 --> 29:47.685
Uh, let's sit first, yeah?

29:54.056 --> 29:56.057
Um...

29:56.124 --> 29:58.628
Look, I know this is sudden,

29:58.698 --> 30:03.575
but I've actually been thinking
about it for a while. After

30:03.643 --> 30:07.145
Ramona and I are married, we're
gonna move out to victorville.

30:07.212 --> 30:09.180
I'm gonna work for her father

30:09.247 --> 30:13.051
in his carpet business and take
over payments on their house.

30:13.119 --> 30:19.460
Jenna already has a room there, and, uh...

30:19.528 --> 30:21.529
Well...

30:21.597 --> 30:25.334
Matt doesn't want either of
you in his life anymore, and

30:25.402 --> 30:28.905
once we leave, he'd no longer
like to stay in contact.

30:34.111 --> 30:36.345
Ok. Fine by me.

30:36.413 --> 30:37.380
Well, hold on a second.

30:37.447 --> 30:38.214
Oh, come on. Let it go.

30:38.282 --> 30:39.081
He'll be back within 6 months,

30:39.149 --> 30:41.151
tail between his legs,
and begging for a handout.

30:41.219 --> 30:43.190
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

30:43.258 --> 30:44.160
Isn't this exactly what you

30:44.228 --> 30:45.330
said before you became addicted

30:45.398 --> 30:47.468
to meth, got married to Kimber,

30:47.536 --> 30:52.040
dressed up as a mime,
and started robbing delis?

30:52.108 --> 30:53.208
Your future husband has quite a

30:53.276 --> 30:55.077
past, just in case you haven't heard.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.846
Matt's actually told me all
about his past. You're not

30:57.914 --> 30:59.915
scaring me, if that's
what you're trying to do.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.885
Really? Sweetie pie...

31:02.953 --> 31:05.354
Has he told you everything?

31:05.422 --> 31:07.323
Mostly about how, despite the

31:07.391 --> 31:09.025
fact that he has two fathers,

31:09.093 --> 31:10.460
he's been made to feel worthless

31:10.528 --> 31:13.896
all of the time. And that even
when he tries his hardest to do

31:13.964 --> 31:16.899
good, you both make him feel like shit.

31:16.966 --> 31:19.635
Is that how you really feel
about us? You don't want us in

31:19.702 --> 31:24.639
your life at all? Matt, we
love you. You're our son.

31:24.707 --> 31:27.675
I'm your punching bag.

31:31.841 --> 31:33.406
Nothing's ever gone right for

31:33.473 --> 31:35.733
me. You know, I've always been

31:35.801 --> 31:38.165
looking for stability and I
think I've finally found it

31:38.233 --> 31:41.729
now, and I don't want to screw
that up. And leaving is the

31:41.797 --> 31:45.229
only way that's gonna work.

31:45.297 --> 31:47.764
I need to be around people who support me.

31:47.832 --> 31:50.366
Hey, don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

31:50.434 --> 31:52.468
Thank you. You just made

31:52.536 --> 31:53.869
this whole thing so much easier

31:53.937 --> 31:56.471
for me. Come on, baby. Let's go.

31:56.539 --> 31:57.772
Matt, wait.

31:57.840 --> 31:58.806
Sean, let him go.

31:58.874 --> 32:02.607
We can talk about this.

32:04.409 --> 32:05.308
Why are you being so

32:05.376 --> 32:07.710
nonchalant? You should be trying
to stop him. That's what he

32:07.778 --> 32:10.579
wants you to do. Can't you see that?

32:10.646 --> 32:11.979
Sean, if you'd like to...

32:12.047 --> 32:13.381
No, what I'd like is for him

32:13.448 --> 32:15.549
to stop being so smug and show

32:15.616 --> 32:17.883
that he gives a shit
about his son for once.

32:17.951 --> 32:19.451
There you go again. Why don't

32:19.519 --> 32:22.153
you take responsibility for
your own failures, huh, instead

32:22.221 --> 32:25.222
of blaming me? Matt
wants to leave us both.

32:25.289 --> 32:26.256
Ok, hold on. Let's stop

32:26.323 --> 32:27.390
arguing about who's at fault

32:27.458 --> 32:29.627
here. I'd like to help you work

32:29.696 --> 32:33.033
together so we can see some progress.

32:33.101 --> 32:36.639
There's no progress to be
made. Matt's never gonna change.

32:36.708 --> 32:37.676
Sean certainly is not gonna

32:37.743 --> 32:40.215
change and neither am I.

32:40.283 --> 32:42.957
The whole therapy thing is bullshit.

32:43.025 --> 32:43.892
You really believe that?

32:43.960 --> 32:44.960
Yes, I do.

32:45.028 --> 32:45.762
But are you at least willing

32:45.830 --> 32:46.899
to try if it means keeping your

32:46.967 --> 32:48.737
relationship with Sean together?

32:48.805 --> 32:49.605
I'm willing to accept who I

32:49.673 --> 32:51.441
am and stop pretending to be

32:51.508 --> 32:52.944
somebody else. Maybe if you

32:53.012 --> 32:54.446
tried that once in a while, you

32:54.513 --> 32:55.847
might not be so miserable.

32:55.915 --> 32:57.715
Like what, accept that you're an asshole?

32:57.783 --> 33:00.485
Accept who you are, that you can't change.

33:00.552 --> 33:02.586
You're right. We should stop

33:02.654 --> 33:07.591
working at this. We
should just end it, end us.

33:07.659 --> 33:09.625
You don't want to end this
relationship. I am the only one

33:09.692 --> 33:12.059
who's been able to put up with
your shit over all these years.

33:12.127 --> 33:13.560
No, I do.

33:13.628 --> 33:15.161
No, you don't.

33:15.229 --> 33:17.796
Then why did I have an affair with Kimber?

33:17.864 --> 33:18.930
Why did you what?

33:18.998 --> 33:22.933
We were sleeping together
for almost a month.

33:28.938 --> 33:31.139
You slept with Kimber
while we were together?

33:31.207 --> 33:35.576
Hoping you'd find out. Then
you'd have a reason to leave me.

33:35.643 --> 33:40.814
You realize how pathetic you are?

33:40.882 --> 33:43.922
Using her to get rid of me?

33:43.990 --> 33:49.801
Why can't you be a man
and ask for what you want?

33:49.869 --> 33:52.471
You want me to tell you now?

33:52.538 --> 33:55.241
Sure. Go ahead. You want to

33:55.308 --> 33:58.244
leave, just like Matt?
There's the door, my friend.

33:58.311 --> 34:01.147
Nobody is stopping you.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.455
Dahlia, I'm sorry. We're
running a little late. Could

34:10.523 --> 34:12.790
you, uh, wait outside for a few minutes?

34:12.858 --> 34:17.127
No. This can't wait.

34:31.962 --> 34:33.562
It's really a miracle.

34:33.630 --> 34:36.061
The bullet didn't even
chip any of his teeth.

34:36.129 --> 34:39.230
Nope, went through both cheeks,
in and out. He was very lucky.

34:39.297 --> 34:41.699
You were both very lucky
neither of you got hit.

34:41.766 --> 34:44.967
Well, like a lot of things,
it wasn't meant to be, I guess.

34:45.034 --> 34:46.802
What's that supposed to mean?

34:46.869 --> 34:48.203
Great job on your side, by

34:48.270 --> 34:53.041
the way. He'll never even
see a scar when it heals.

34:53.109 --> 34:54.009
What?

34:54.110 --> 34:56.143
I'm saying I'm impressed.

34:56.212 --> 34:57.746
Why?

34:57.814 --> 35:01.183
I'm focusing on the good,
like he said. Trying to change

35:01.251 --> 35:02.919
my response to the situation.

35:02.987 --> 35:04.721
I figured it would be better to

35:04.789 --> 35:06.257
pay you a compliment right now.

35:06.325 --> 35:08.392
I'm not interested in your

35:08.460 --> 35:10.627
compliments, all right? What
I want right now is a decision.

35:10.695 --> 35:12.195
About what?

35:12.263 --> 35:13.997
Either you're staying or
you're going, all right? After

35:14.065 --> 35:14.831
all that talk, after all that

35:14.899 --> 35:18.035
therapeutic exercise, I want to

35:18.102 --> 35:19.369
know where we stand.

35:19.437 --> 35:21.271
Maybe we should talk about this...

35:21.339 --> 35:23.373
No more talking. There has
been so much talking I'm

35:23.441 --> 35:26.844
exhausted, all right? You need
to make a decision, and you need

35:26.912 --> 35:30.478
to make it soon. I'll tell you
what, you make a decision by

35:30.546 --> 35:33.546
5:00 this afternoon. Otherwise,
I'll make one for you, huh?

35:33.614 --> 35:36.682
How's that for clarity?

35:46.723 --> 35:47.790
Hi.

35:47.857 --> 35:54.129
Hi. Ahem.

35:54.197 --> 35:59.533
Ok, so just let me ask. Am I
gonna have to look for a new job?

35:59.601 --> 36:01.801
I can't see why. Sean's gonna
have to work somewhere if

36:01.869 --> 36:04.736
he leaves. I'm sure he'll take
you with him, maybe even give

36:04.803 --> 36:07.171
you that, uh, partnership
you're looking for.

36:07.238 --> 36:08.705
So who's to say, if you two

36:08.773 --> 36:10.873
were to split up, I would go with Sean?

36:10.941 --> 36:13.775
I think you made that clear
when you chose to use his

36:13.843 --> 36:16.310
man juice in your Turkey baster.

36:16.377 --> 36:18.278
You don't get it.

36:18.345 --> 36:20.246
No, I get it, and I get it

36:20.313 --> 36:22.213
fine, ok? After all these years,

36:22.281 --> 36:23.981
after the crap that I put you

36:24.049 --> 36:25.116
through... the divorce, everything

36:25.183 --> 36:28.285
else... he's stable, you know?

36:29.722 --> 36:32.159
At least he pretends to be a good guy.

36:32.226 --> 36:34.729
Look, I don't have to defend

36:34.797 --> 36:37.199
my choice to you. If it hurts

36:37.267 --> 36:39.535
that I don't like you best or I

36:39.603 --> 36:40.637
didn't pick you yet again,

36:40.704 --> 36:46.508
sorry. I picked Sean because,
unlike you, he won't try to own

36:46.576 --> 36:51.978
me and my baby. I mean, he did
this for me. He doesn't want

36:52.046 --> 36:56.448
anything back. He knows it's mine
and he has nothing to do with it.

36:57.517 --> 37:00.318
Right. Selfless old Sean. And

37:00.386 --> 37:04.288
that's it? That's the whole
reason that you picked him?

37:04.356 --> 37:05.690
Yes, that's it, the whole

37:05.758 --> 37:06.957
reason I picked him.

37:07.025 --> 37:08.792
Well, I think it's bullshit.

37:08.860 --> 37:09.859
It's your little way of holding

37:09.927 --> 37:11.226
on. You can pretend all you want

37:11.294 --> 37:14.596
it's just about you, but you without us?

37:14.664 --> 37:16.097
Who are you?

37:16.165 --> 37:18.165
Maybe.

37:18.233 --> 37:20.467
But I never have to worry about

37:20.535 --> 37:22.535
you disappearing out of my life.

37:22.603 --> 37:24.370
You need me too much to bolster

37:24.438 --> 37:26.740
up that fragile ego of yours.

37:26.807 --> 37:28.675
With Sean, it's different. Maybe

37:28.743 --> 37:30.311
this connection will help us to

37:30.379 --> 37:34.148
stay connected. So what?

37:34.216 --> 37:37.485
Is that so wrong?

37:48.097 --> 37:52.267
Oh. Uh, your receptionist
said I could see him?

37:52.335 --> 37:55.904
It'll be a while before
he wakes up. And you are?

37:55.972 --> 37:59.207
Oh, I'm the husband of
the woman who shot him.

37:59.275 --> 38:00.642
Ron Mark.

38:00.709 --> 38:04.346
I'm Sean McNamara. My
partner and I did the surgery.

38:04.414 --> 38:06.582
I'll take this. Thank you.

38:06.649 --> 38:11.485
Gee, you can imagine I feel
pretty terrible. Dr. Griffin's

38:11.553 --> 38:14.622
a decent man, you know?
He was just trying to help.

38:14.689 --> 38:18.125
Where is your wife, by the
way? Nowhere near here, I hope.

38:18.192 --> 38:21.128
She's in custody.

38:21.196 --> 38:22.930
I was always telling her how

38:22.997 --> 38:26.633
crazy she was. Made her furious.

38:26.701 --> 38:29.970
Now I'm wondering if I was
actually making it come true,

38:30.037 --> 38:33.442
you know? I mean, could
I have driven her crazy?

38:33.510 --> 38:37.981
Well, it's a chicken and egg
kind of question, you know?

38:38.048 --> 38:38.715
I think you'll make yourself

38:38.782 --> 38:41.651
crazy trying to get to the bottom of that.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.419
You know the real irony of it

38:43.487 --> 38:47.924
all? She'll probably use
insanity as her defense.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.727
Man. If I could just turn the

38:50.795 --> 38:54.998
clock back and do that
last session over again.

38:55.066 --> 38:58.001
What would you do differently?

38:58.069 --> 39:01.438
I'd try to see myself through
her eyes. You know, I went in

39:01.506 --> 39:04.474
there with an agenda. I wasn't
being open. I wasn't being

39:04.542 --> 39:07.210
honest. I was just playing
the same old games, talking in

39:07.278 --> 39:08.845
sports metaphors which make her

39:08.913 --> 39:12.115
crazy, playing the wounded
party, making her feel like

39:12.183 --> 39:15.752
a monster, and then... bam...
I throw divorce papers at her.

39:15.819 --> 39:18.187
She took a gun and she tried
to kill her therapist. That's

39:18.255 --> 39:23.524
not within any reasonable range
of human behavior I'm aware of.

39:25.661 --> 39:29.800
Well... I'll tell him you stopped by.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.437
Thank you.

39:35.874 --> 39:40.713
You know, no one's ever
totally without blame. No one.

39:54.761 --> 39:58.698
I'd like to kill him. I'd
like to take a gun and I'd like

39:58.765 --> 40:01.200
to shoot him in the head. No,

40:01.268 --> 40:02.135
scratch that. I'd like to take

40:02.202 --> 40:05.404
a knife... slice his balls off.

40:05.472 --> 40:06.572
That's what I'd like to do.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.540
You're a therapist. I can say

40:07.607 --> 40:08.407
that kind of shit and you're not

40:08.475 --> 40:09.542
gonna go to the police, right?

40:09.609 --> 40:10.409
I mean, you know what I'm

40:10.477 --> 40:13.746
talking about. I'm just angry, that's all.

40:13.813 --> 40:15.080
I think I know the difference

40:15.148 --> 40:16.515
between feelings and fact.

40:16.583 --> 40:20.185
Ten minutes late at this
point in the game? He's so

40:20.253 --> 40:22.288
passive-aggressive, it makes me sick.

40:22.355 --> 40:25.297
Is it a pattern? Do you feel like
he's always keeping you waiting?

40:26.255 --> 40:28.327
It is kind of become that way,
I must say. I mean, he doesn't

40:28.395 --> 40:30.529
know what he's doing.

40:30.597 --> 40:34.933
So, it sounds like you're
more certain of wanting the

40:35.001 --> 40:40.072
- relationship to continue, whereas you see...
- Sean.

40:40.140 --> 40:42.007
Sean. Sorry. Whereas you see

40:42.075 --> 40:46.578
Sean as having issues, so to
speak. Have I got that right?

40:46.646 --> 40:47.813
Kind of.

40:49.816 --> 40:51.383
Speak of the devil.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.485
Sorry. Big mess on Wilshire.

40:53.553 --> 40:55.353
It's always something, ain't it, pal?

40:55.421 --> 40:57.455
Hello, doctor. I'm Sean McNamara.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.392
Karen Singer. Nice to meet you.

41:00.459 --> 41:04.596
Ah. So... ahem... has he
been filling you in on what a

41:04.663 --> 41:06.998
screwed-up,
passive-aggressive wimp I am?

41:07.066 --> 41:09.734
Is that your perception
of how he views you?

41:09.802 --> 41:13.905
Oh, I don't know. I don't know
what's real about anything anymore.

41:13.973 --> 41:17.575
Heh! You don't? Why
doesn't that surprise me?

41:17.643 --> 41:19.110
Are we gonna spend the whole

41:19.178 --> 41:23.948
session taking pot shots at each other?

41:24.017 --> 41:26.886
I don't know.

41:26.953 --> 41:29.122
Are we?

41:29.189 --> 41:33.894
So, doctors, let's start at the beginning.

41:33.961 --> 41:39.100
Tell me what you don't like
about your relationship.
