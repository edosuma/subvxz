Come on, cousin,
we got a lot to do

01:23.784 --> 01:25.652
before King Ferdinand gets here.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.660
Cousin, uh, uh,
didn’t you see your outfit?

01:33.694 --> 01:35.862
I laid it up
on your bed for you.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.598
Come on, go upstairs and change.
Come on. Bushi, bushi, bushi‐‐

01:37.631 --> 01:39.365
No, no, no, no, no. No.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.568
Balki, Balki, I agreed

01:41.602 --> 01:44.470
to let you decorate the house
with a salad bar.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.442
And I agreed to let you
have a reception

01:49.475 --> 01:51.211
here for King Ferdinand.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.182
But I am not dressing up
like a snout merchant.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.721
‐How about just the loincloth?
‐No.

02:02.488 --> 02:04.658
But, uh, cousin,
this is a special occasion.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.759
King Ferdinand is going to be

02:05.792 --> 02:07.293
the grand marshal of a parade.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.628
Parade?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.531
Balki, he’s walking down
Stage Street

02:10.564 --> 02:12.498
with a bunch of cows.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.836
Cousin, King Ferdinand

02:15.869 --> 02:18.739
is leading the Livestock
Liberation Parade.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.175
Alright, uh, uh, let’s just, uh

02:22.208 --> 02:23.810
go over the official
greeting for royalty.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.712
Okay, now, cousin,
this is very important.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.816
Um...when meeting royalty

02:29.850 --> 02:31.918
protocol must
be followed, alright?

02:31.952 --> 02:34.588
So, the king will come
to the door and he will say

02:34.621 --> 02:38.191
in his most regal voice,
"Knock, knock."

02:40.326 --> 02:42.863
And then you, as
head of the household, will say

02:42.896 --> 02:45.498
"Who’s there?"

02:45.532 --> 02:48.635
And then the king will say,
"The king."

02:48.669 --> 02:51.371
And then you will say,
"The king who?"

02:53.373 --> 02:57.377
And then the king will say,
"Gesundheit"and then we laugh.

02:57.410 --> 03:00.747
Okay, so...laugh.
Let‐let me hear it.

03:07.654 --> 03:11.257
Not exactly the big yuk
I was hoping for but...

03:11.291 --> 03:13.894
...then again I don’t have
the king’s delivery.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.429
‐What can I tell you?
‐’Knock, knock!’

03:16.462 --> 03:17.698
The king’s early.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.566
Oh, oh, God, oh God, he’s early!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.001
I haven’t even had
the chance to spray

03:21.034 --> 03:22.869
the room with
welcoming goat fragrance.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.838
Alright, alright,
calm down, calm down.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.972
It’s okay,
everything’s under control.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.340
‐Uh, uh...
‐Come on, come on.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.975
‐We can do this, here we go.
‐Oh, God...

03:29.009 --> 03:32.546
‐Here we go. Okay?
‐’Knock, knock!’

03:33.780 --> 03:36.717
‐Who’s there?
‐’The king.’

03:38.752 --> 03:42.388
‐The king who?

w‐w‐where would you
like to go first?

05:36.436 --> 05:37.971
To see a dentist!

05:56.422 --> 05:58.358
I think he likes you.
Scratch him behind the ears.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.996
Uh, um‐um, Balki,
I‐I think something’s wrong.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.732
Oh, cousin, it’s probably
just a serious case of jetlag.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.401
Isn’t it? Isn’t it?

06:08.434 --> 06:11.638
No, Balki, I‐I‐I don’t think
that it’s jetlag.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.912
He’s dead.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.650
Are you sure?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.824
Positive.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.427
King Ferdinand is dead.

All hail Cousin Larry,
the new king of Mypos.

‐Yeah.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.646

06:52.679 --> 06:54.648
We all knew
the king had a weak heart.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.084
Everybody always said

06:58.118 --> 07:00.854
"Long live the king,"
but nobody really believed it.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.894
Well, we should call
someone to move him.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.996
Oh, no. No‐no, cousin.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.632
We cannot do that.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.734
The Kingly Carcass
must not be moved

07:13.767 --> 07:15.569
until the speaker
of the hut arrives.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.505
The who?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.674
The Speaker of the Hut
of Representatives.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.547
He is the man
who oversees the day‐to‐day

07:26.580 --> 07:28.181
governing of Mypos.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.916
And in his spare time
he manages

07:29.950 --> 07:31.685
a four‐day tire store.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.023
He’s really a very nice guy.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.659
Too bad he wasn’t here
to catch the king.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.161

he’d make a great king.

Your Diminutiveness.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.636

No, no, no‐no.

No, get up, get up.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.845
Get up, get up.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.814
Get up... You may rise.

08:10.056 --> 08:13.026
Don’t call me
"Your Diminutiveness."

08:13.059 --> 08:14.995
As you wish, Your Compactness.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.703
Uh‐uh‐uh, Balki, just because
the king died in my arms

08:22.736 --> 08:24.738
doesn’t mean that
I am the king of Mypos.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.608
Cousin, I’m telling you this,
whoever is the first person

08:27.641 --> 08:29.643
to touch the king after he dies
becomes the new king.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
It’s a tradition.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.881
W‐well, w‐w‐what if he had
fallen into someone else’s arms?

08:34.914 --> 08:35.982
Someone else
would be the new king.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.082
‐Really?
‐Yes, really.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.318
Now, if you’ll excuse me

08:38.351 --> 08:40.253
I have to call Mypos
to tell the authorities

08:40.285 --> 08:41.621
that you’re going to be
the new king.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.856
Oh, no‐no‐no...

08:42.889 --> 08:45.025
Hold‐hold‐hold off on that call.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.694
I need to give them time
to put your face on the money.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.263
No. No, Balki.
Balki, we have got to...

08:54.968 --> 08:56.703
They’re going to put
my face on the money?

08:58.705 --> 09:02.075
Well, just the five digda note
and the pingis.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.878
They’re are going to put my face
on the money?

09:04.911 --> 09:06.346
Wait, no, alright, no, no, no!
Look, Balki!

09:06.379 --> 09:09.816
Th‐th‐this is crazy.
Just hold off on that call.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.253
Alright, you‐you know,
if I’m going to be king

09:13.286 --> 09:17.223
I need to immerse myself
in the food of my people.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.325
I just happen to have
a vat of yak fat.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.127
No, you know, Balki.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.230
I’m not in a yak fat mood.

09:24.264 --> 09:28.201
Go out and get me some
chocolate covered...goat parts.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.603
Which goat parts would you like?

09:29.636 --> 09:31.171
Get me the sampler.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.109
Go now.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.343
As you wish, Your Petiteness.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.047
[instrumental music]

09:48.154 --> 09:50.957
I, I‐I couldn’t find
any chocolate covered

09:50.991 --> 09:52.759
goat parts, Your Liplessness.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.161
So, I’ll just heat up some
chocolate and dip them myself.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.163
Thank you, Balki.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.332
You know, Your Majesty,
you couldn’t ask

09:59.365 --> 10:02.335
for a more loyal subject
than Balki Bartokomous.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.004
Oh! Hi, Balki.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.038
[gasps]

10:07.974 --> 10:10.844
He’s alive. He’s alive.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.013
All hail
King Ferdinand of Mypos!

10:22.022 --> 10:23.657
[instrumental music]

10:26.426 --> 10:28.361
Balki, don’t get your hopes up.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.430
King Ferdinand is still dead.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.100
But, cousin, cousin,
he, he waved at me.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.037
You‐you must have seen it,
you were sitting right there.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.672
Yeah, Balki, I made him wave.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.876
See? Fishing line, huh?

10:42.909 --> 10:43.977
Pretty good, huh?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.781
You’re playing puppets
with a dead monarch?

10:50.316 --> 10:53.186
Balki, Balki, look.
Here’s my plan.

10:53.219 --> 10:57.023
We’ll just keep King Ferdinand
alive for just a few more hours

10:57.057 --> 10:59.292
then dump him into the arms
of the speaker of the hut

10:59.325 --> 11:00.894
when he arrives
at the reception.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.429
The speaker will be king
and everybody will be happy.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.232
Your Obsessiveness

11:06.266 --> 11:08.134
you caught the king,
so you are the king

11:08.168 --> 11:10.403
I rest my face.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.906
Balki, Balki,
now, now, listen to me.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.407
Listen to me,
listen to me, will you?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.842
‐Just stop, stop!
‐No, no, no!

11:15.876 --> 11:17.844
Balki, you said it yourself.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.446
The speaker of the hut would
make a terrific king for Mypos.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.450
Well, he has been trying
to catch a dead king for years.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.288
And I would make a lousy king,
you know me.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.758
I‐I’m selfish, pushy, greedy.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.327
Shallow, hypocritical

11:34.360 --> 11:35.529
and a bold‐faced liar.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.466
But that won’t impair your
ability to lead the country.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.338
Face it, you’re the king.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.407
Oh, no, no, no...

11:47.440 --> 11:49.442
Uh, oh, al‐alright.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.477
Alright...

11:51.512 --> 11:53.313
...I’ll be the king.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.948
You may rise.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.855
Balki, you know
the first thing I’m going to do

12:01.888 --> 12:03.857
as king of Mypos?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.491
Put a booster chair
on the throne?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.834
No.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.437
I am going to turn
the island of Mypos

12:17.470 --> 12:21.441
into a radioactive
toxic waste dump.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.143
What do you think of that?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.446
I don’t think
you should do that.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.884
Oh, you don’t think
I should do that?

12:30.917 --> 12:33.086
Mm‐hmm, no, no, no, I don’t
think you should do that‐‐

12:33.119 --> 12:36.456
But I am the king
and I think as the king

12:36.489 --> 12:39.793
I would know
what’s best for the island.

12:39.826 --> 12:43.496
And nobody, not you,
not the speaker of the hut

12:43.530 --> 12:45.431
can stop me... Get down there!

12:45.465 --> 12:48.769
Get down there! Yes, yes...

12:51.171 --> 12:53.540
[Balki grunting]

12:53.574 --> 12:58.545
Yes, a radioactive
toxic waste dump it will be.

12:58.579 --> 13:00.514
‐You may rise.
‐No, no, no.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.587
Of course, all the Mypiots
will glow in the dark.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.589
No.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.256
But think of all the money
we’ll save on

13:10.290 --> 13:13.359
florescent vests
for the road crews!

13:13.393 --> 13:16.329
Try me for treason
and call me eggs benedict but...

13:18.632 --> 13:20.333
...I don’t think
you should be the king.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.004
Oh, you don’t think
I should be the king?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.572
No, I don’t think
you should be the king.

13:25.606 --> 13:28.609
Oh, you don’t think
I should be the king?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.844
‐Oh, but I am the king.
‐But you should not be...

13:30.877 --> 13:32.879
I am the king... Get down there!

13:32.913 --> 13:35.081
Get down there...huh!

13:35.115 --> 13:36.850
[Balki sobbing]

13:38.451 --> 13:40.554
I am the king.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.523
[whimpering]

13:42.556 --> 13:45.458
But I don’t think
you should be the king.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.428
Oh, you don’t think
I should be the king?

13:48.461 --> 13:49.429
No, I don’t.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.364
Oh, you don’t think
I should be the king?

13:51.397 --> 13:55.168
But I am the king
and it’s too late now.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.606
‐It’s too late now.
‐Yes.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.209
Yes, it’s too late now.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.046
[gasps]
Unless...

14:06.079 --> 14:08.348
It’s too late now...

14:08.381 --> 14:09.415
[sobbing]

14:09.449 --> 14:10.517
Yes, yes.

14:10.551 --> 14:13.019
‐Unless...
‐Unless what?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.957
Unless...

14:16.990 --> 14:18.358
Oh, no. It would never work.
It’s too perfect.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.129
Cousin, we may have to settle
for perfect. We’re desperate.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.600
Well, you know,
I was thinking...

14:28.434 --> 14:30.937
If we pretend
King Ferdinand is alive

14:30.971 --> 14:33.306
and then drop him
into the arms of‐of someone

14:33.339 --> 14:34.908
who would make
a terrific king...

14:34.941 --> 14:37.944
Someone who would know
how to run the country.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.515
Someone who has been waiting
to catch a king for years...

14:43.383 --> 14:46.186
But no one comes to mind.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.188
Wait a minute! I know someone.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.991
‐The speaker of the hut.
‐Huh, Balki!

14:51.024 --> 14:52.458
‐You’re a genius.
‐Well, I did, you know‐‐

14:52.492 --> 14:54.327
We’ll just drop
the king into the arms

14:54.360 --> 14:57.063
of the speaker of the hut
and we’ll save Mypos.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.632
Oh, cousin!

14:58.665 --> 15:00.266
Cousin, we have to go make
King Ferdinand

15:00.300 --> 15:01.467
ready for the party!

15:01.502 --> 15:04.505
[instrumental music]

15:20.654 --> 15:24.057
Here you go, cousin.
I thought you might...want that.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.291
Thank you.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.568
[mumbling]

15:39.773 --> 15:41.708
(Larry)
’Balki, there he is.’

15:43.544 --> 15:47.147
Well, that’s our speaker
alright. Old Walki Talki.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.715
And his lovely wife,
Chatti Kathi.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.453
Although she, she prefers
to be called Cookie.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.157
‐Balki, go get him.
‐Okay.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.182
Well, you’re absolutely right,
Your Majesty.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.284
It makes a marvelous aftershave.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.622
Oki doki, how’s it hangi?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.791
Oki doki, Balki.
Reminiski Cookie?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.325
You bet your bibbibabka!

16:34.227 --> 16:36.496
‐How’s it hangi, Cookie?
‐Super.

16:36.530 --> 16:40.000
(all)
Ingi wingi wingi.
Oh, w‐woww!

16:47.207 --> 16:48.742
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

16:48.775 --> 16:51.344
Oh, King Ferdinand,
you little scamp.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.313
[laughs]

16:54.447 --> 16:57.584
Whoa! Oh!

16:57.618 --> 16:59.185
Oh, you little devil.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.321
[Lydia laughs]

17:01.354 --> 17:02.789
Ooh. Ha ha ha.

17:02.823 --> 17:06.492
Oh, cold hands, warm heart.

17:09.128 --> 17:12.165
‐ Suplitaki, Walki Talki?
‐Balki, no can do.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.436
Cousin, cousin, cousin,
we‐we have a big problem.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.106
The speaker and King Ferdinand
aren’t speaking to each other.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.541
They had a big fight
before they left Mypos.

17:21.575 --> 17:22.776
Something about whether

17:22.809 --> 17:26.146
Certs is really
two‐two‐two mints in one.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.417
Alright, Balki, new plan.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.654
If the speaker won’t come
to the king

17:33.687 --> 17:35.188
the king will have to go
to the speaker.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.590
Hold this, hold this.
Just hold this.

17:36.623 --> 17:41.127
Ah. Ahem, uh, excuse me,
uh, Your Majesty.

17:41.161 --> 17:45.498
Uh, Lydia, I know the king
has taken a great liking to you

17:45.532 --> 17:48.434
but it really is time for him
to mingle with the other guests.

17:49.770 --> 17:54.107
Well, alright,
as long as you promise

17:54.140 --> 17:56.176
to save me a dance
later tonight.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.445
Do you promise?

17:59.479 --> 18:02.348
[chuckles]
Well, I don’t think
he’ll have time for that.

18:02.382 --> 18:05.318
Ooh. Maybe he will.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.795
Balki, will you give me a hand?

18:16.630 --> 18:19.533
S‐s‐stop it, just stop it,
stop it, stop it, stop it!

18:20.701 --> 18:22.703
A dead man is not a toy.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.844
Balki, we’ve got to get the king
to the speaker of the hut.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.546
Now we can’t just drag him
around the room.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.648
‐We gotta make him look alive.
‐No problem, cousin.

18:38.652 --> 18:41.588
[grunting]

18:46.760 --> 18:48.695
[instrumental music]

19:08.649 --> 19:10.717
Balki, just get the speaker
of the hut to turn around

19:10.751 --> 19:12.318
and I’ll drop King Ferdinand
into his arms.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.687
Got it.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.792
Uh, Cookie.
Cookie, did you see over there?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.161
We have, uh, chips
and sheep dip.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.467
Your Speakership, there’s
something I have never told you.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.570
The night that
you and Cookie did the

19:29.603 --> 19:32.405
"Captain and Tennille" medley,
I was really moved.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.375
‐Ooh.
‐No, yes I was. Oh, yes.

19:35.408 --> 19:39.680
Um, I finally understood
the meaning of "Muskrat Love."

19:39.713 --> 19:41.381
Oh, look, the king.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.349
I’ve got nothing to say to you.

19:47.521 --> 19:50.390
Oh, uh, well, uh,
sorry about that, uh

19:50.423 --> 19:52.926
loose floor board, Your Majesty.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.729
We’ll just have that
fixed i‐immediately.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.698
[panting]

20:11.578 --> 20:13.747
Alright, let’s go.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.550
Oh, no time for that. Look,
let’s just get him over there.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.584
Come on.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.724
Oh, no more punch for you,
big guy.

20:25.826 --> 20:28.461
[grunting]

20:28.494 --> 20:30.396
‐Hold him.
‐Okay.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.733
Uh... Excuse me, uh, Mr. Hut?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.337
The king would like
to apologize to you

20:37.370 --> 20:38.939
for arguing with you earlier.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.741
Well, is that so?

20:41.942 --> 20:44.911
Well, this I would like to hear.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.351
Whoo‐ooh!

20:56.590 --> 20:58.291
‐The king is dead!
‐The king is dead!

20:58.324 --> 21:00.360
‐Long live Queen Cookie.
‐Long live Queen Cookie.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.669
[instrumental music]

21:12.873 --> 21:15.008
Mail call, cousin.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.343
Oh, anything for me?

21:17.377 --> 21:20.881
Just this, uh, winter catalogue
from Digby’s Fine Apparel.

21:20.914 --> 21:24.450
"Clothing the little man
since 1954."

21:24.484 --> 21:25.385
Let me have that.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.753
You know, I think
you’d look adorable

21:26.787 --> 21:28.388
in that little sailor suit
on the cover.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.356
It’s just...

21:30.390 --> 21:31.958
Oh, cousin, look,
I got a letter from mama.

21:31.992 --> 21:34.027
Oh, well, what she have to say?

21:34.060 --> 21:36.963
Well...let’s see here.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.766
She says that, uh, ever since

21:39.800 --> 21:41.668
Queen Cookie
has been ruling Mypos

21:41.702 --> 21:44.771
it’s just nothing
but party, party, party

21:44.805 --> 21:48.074
and the, uh, the fun began
with the Queen’s coronation

21:48.108 --> 21:50.511
tractor pull
and demolition derby.

21:52.045 --> 21:53.947
Well, that sounds
very entertaining.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.048
Oh, cousin, look.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.349
She send pictures of, of

21:56.382 --> 21:57.951
King Ferdinand’s send‐off.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.087
‐Y‐y‐you mean his, uh, funeral.
‐No, no, I‐I mean his send‐off.

22:01.121 --> 22:03.890
See there’s a picture of them
strapping him to the catapult.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.862
Well, don’t‐don’t they bury him
in the ground or‐or at sea?

22:08.895 --> 22:10.864
Well, that all depends
on where he lands.

22:10.897 --> 22:14.801
See there’s a...there’s
a picture of the launch.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.469
Excellent hang time.

22:18.038 --> 22:19.773
He had really quite good form.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.008
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐For...for a dead man.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.810
‐Uh, yeah.
‐Mm‐hmm.

22:23.844 --> 22:26.780
[theme music]

22:54.074 --> 22:55.809
[music continues]
