00:04.734 --> 00:06.076
<i>(Frankie) I know what</i>
<i>you're thinking--</i>

00:06.188 --> 00:07.889
<i>how did I end up in prison?</i>

00:08.157 --> 00:11.355
<i>Well, it all started with my</i>
<i>kids not brushing their teeth.</i>

00:11.523 --> 00:12.587
- Did you guys brush your teeth?
(Sue) - Yes.

00:12.762 --> 00:13.777
- God.
(Brick) - We always do.

00:13.833 --> 00:15.493
Good. Now chew these,
and we'll see how well.

00:15.602 --> 00:17.187
I have an oral hygiene practical
tomorrow,

00:17.280 --> 00:18.840
and I need to be able
to spot plaque

00:18.966 --> 00:20.381
and teach
better brushing techniques.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.775
I liked it better
when you worked at the car lot

00:21.902 --> 00:23.110
and brought home doughnuts.

00:23.228 --> 00:24.652
I liked it
when she brought home salary.

00:24.846 --> 00:26.588
Uh, hey. Friendly reminder--

00:26.690 --> 00:29.342
only 10 more days
till my Sweet 16,

00:29.478 --> 00:33.188
or as I like to call it,
my "Sue-weet" 16. (Laughs)

00:33.298 --> 00:34.645
That's ten days
away from driving,

00:34.774 --> 00:37.343
two years away from voting,
and five years away

00:37.442 --> 00:40.347
from having a glass of wine
to take the edge off.

00:40.455 --> 00:43.294
Dad, I'm serious. Cassidy has
a later curfew than me.

00:43.370 --> 00:45.639
Do you know how embarrassing
that is? Be a bro.

00:45.950 --> 00:49.472
Well, I'll never be your bro,
but I'll bump it to 12:30.

00:49.597 --> 00:52.968
Ha! I was trying for 12:30,
so I asked for 1:30.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.401
You just got played.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.120
Well, I would have gone
to 1:00.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.087
So what's that
you kids say again?

00:58.188 --> 00:59.357
Booyah?

00:59.900 --> 01:01.493
(Dog barking in distance)
Okay. I'm thinking at the party,

01:01.628 --> 01:03.809
everyone will bake
their own individual cakes.

01:03.950 --> 01:05.652
That means between you, me,

01:05.813 --> 01:07.667
Brad, Carly,
and the wrestlerettes,

01:07.788 --> 01:08.816
that'd be seven cakes.

01:08.906 --> 01:10.884
Ten if dad, Axl,
and Brick want to do it.

01:11.077 --> 01:12.229
So seven.

01:12.443 --> 01:13.778
Okay, did you guys
finish chewing?

01:13.911 --> 01:15.106
'Cause I have to examine
your teeth

01:15.216 --> 01:16.426
to see if there's
any tiny red spots

01:16.535 --> 01:18.191
where you might have
missed brushing.

01:20.857 --> 01:23.156
I don't have
your professional eye, Frankie.

01:23.313 --> 01:24.910
Where'd they miss?

01:25.902 --> 01:30.334
I'm making a list of games
to play for my "Sue-weet" 16.

01:30.455 --> 01:31.922
And this is what
I have so far--

01:32.162 --> 01:34.767
charades, celebrity charades,

01:34.934 --> 01:35.964
Pictionary,

01:36.043 --> 01:37.349
celebrity Pictionary--

01:37.467 --> 01:39.486
Sue, if you have any prayer
of being remotely cool,

01:39.643 --> 01:41.496
you gotta play the game
the cool kids are playing.

01:41.612 --> 01:42.787
Surprised you haven't
heard of it yet.

01:42.921 --> 01:44.517
It's called smell dad's boot.

01:44.618 --> 01:47.366
(Muffled voice) - Aah! Get it off me!
- Oh! Smell it, Sue! Smell it!

01:47.466 --> 01:48.786
- Axl! Oh, gross!
- How long can you last?

01:48.897 --> 01:51.036
(Coughing)
Ha ha! Oh. Mere seconds.

01:51.189 --> 01:52.612
Try sticking your head
in the hamper

01:52.718 --> 01:54.743
to build your stamina and get that time up.
(Shoes thud)

01:54.841 --> 01:55.950
(Laughs)

01:56.045 --> 01:57.234
Here's a game, Axl--

01:57.358 --> 01:59.682
it's called catch dad's boot
with your face!

01:59.894 --> 02:01.167
(Pop, glass shatters)

02:01.228 --> 02:04.093
Oh, nice job, Sue!
Look what you did!

02:04.233 --> 02:05.790
It's not my fault!

02:05.935 --> 02:08.517
It's <i>your</i> fault
with that stupid game.

02:08.674 --> 02:11.123
Besides, Brick is the one
who sent it through the window.

02:11.243 --> 02:13.210
I'm just impressed I hit it.

02:13.321 --> 02:18.232
Oh, no. Oh, no, this is bad.
This is really, really bad.

02:18.359 --> 02:21.038
When mom and dad come home,
they're gonna freak out.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.205
And they're already dealing
with a broken car windshield.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.839
And they don't even know
about the hole in my wall.

02:25.947 --> 02:27.861
Uh, they fixed that a year ago.

02:27.977 --> 02:29.945
- New hole.
- Seriously?

02:30.865 --> 02:33.563
Okay, okay.
Well at least with three of us,

02:33.669 --> 02:35.714
they'll have to spread
the punishment around.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.978
We all did it,

02:37.101 --> 02:39.541
and we are all just gonna
have to take responsibility.

02:39.648 --> 02:42.061
Or... none of us did it,

02:42.165 --> 02:43.922
and none of us are gonna
take responsibility.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.366
What are you
talking about, Axl?

02:45.485 --> 02:47.472
We have to.
We're the ones who did it.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.223
Unless we didn't.

02:49.382 --> 02:50.999
Unless we were
just sitting here,

02:51.114 --> 02:53.178
and the Glossners came and threw
a rock through the window.

02:53.296 --> 02:55.430
That's a very Glossner thing
to do.

02:59.167 --> 03:01.604
Okay. Now, uh,
sprinkle the glass around

03:01.678 --> 03:03.593
so it looks like the rock
came from outside.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.006
Ow!

03:06.193 --> 03:07.908
How come you don't have
to touch any glass?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.018
'Cause I got fingerprinted
for the missing child program

03:10.123 --> 03:11.988
back when mom and dad
still cared.

03:12.717 --> 03:15.594
Yeah. Mm.
(Under breath) Let's see.

03:16.375 --> 03:16.916
(Thuds)

03:17.384 --> 03:19.569
Okay. Yeah. This is good.

03:19.722 --> 03:21.196
Now look innocent.

03:21.484 --> 03:23.285
Let's get
our stories straight. Sue!

03:23.402 --> 03:25.937
Uh, we were just sitting
on the couch relaxing,

03:26.108 --> 03:28.079
- watching TV--
- Brick!

03:28.271 --> 03:32.444
When the Glossners viciously
threw a rock threw our window.

03:32.573 --> 03:34.035
Excellent. (Chuckles)

03:34.317 --> 03:35.546
(Gagging) (Whispers) I'm lying.

03:39.027 --> 03:40.186
Thank you, Shorty's Pizza,

03:40.297 --> 03:41.988
for rolling back prices
to the '50s. (Chuckles)

03:42.120 --> 03:44.962
I like the '50s. It's the only
place I can afford.

03:45.086 --> 03:47.585
I feel a little guilty that they
gave us all these extra pies

03:47.710 --> 03:49.573
when they saw us
get into the church van.

03:49.695 --> 03:51.807
Although we do
work with troubled teens.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.829
I'm telling you, Frankie,
this thing is magic.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.151
I rolled through
a stop sign last week

03:55.272 --> 03:57.340
right in front of a cop,
and he just waved.

03:57.495 --> 03:58.978
Don't push it, Mike, seriously.

03:59.127 --> 04:01.327
Ask yourself,
"what would Jesus do?"

04:01.443 --> 04:03.175
In this van?
Same thing I'm doing--

04:03.297 --> 04:05.136
50 in a 35.
(Laughs)

04:06.273 --> 04:08.869
You guys
never learned how to lie.

04:08.995 --> 04:11.121
Clearly, our public schools
are failing us.

04:11.245 --> 04:13.127
Brick, the first rule
of lying--

04:13.274 --> 04:14.418
don't say you're lying.

04:14.536 --> 04:16.783
I'm not trying to do it.
It-- it just happens.

04:16.911 --> 04:18.522
Well, try this--
after you lie,

04:18.666 --> 04:20.079
add something true
to the end of the lie,

04:20.195 --> 04:22.600
that way you'll trick your brain
into thinking you're not lying.

04:22.724 --> 04:23.633
Okay.

04:23.737 --> 04:25.468
The Glossners threw
a rock through our window,

04:25.628 --> 04:27.045
and...

04:27.247 --> 04:28.895
it's dark outside.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.391
Yes!

04:32.509 --> 04:34.256
(Whispers)
The first part is a lie.

04:34.605 --> 04:35.603
We'll work on that.

04:35.728 --> 04:38.407
Sue, focus on
the details of the lie,

04:38.544 --> 04:40.936
that way, you'll trick
your stomach into not barfing.

04:41.045 --> 04:43.489
All right.
Uh, it-- it was 7:14,

04:43.591 --> 04:44.911
and we heard a sound.

04:45.031 --> 04:47.997
No-- it was 7:13
and a rock came.

04:48.177 --> 04:51.500
No-- 7:14, because I had
just taken a bite of cheese.

04:51.646 --> 04:53.344
Colby. No-- cheddar.

04:53.472 --> 04:55.076
- And-- and--
- Okay. You suck at details.

04:55.218 --> 04:57.248
Just make your point,
gloss over the rest.

04:57.373 --> 04:58.640
(Car doors close) Oh, God.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.552
We're out of time. Okay.

05:05.353 --> 05:08.952
(Singsongy) I have pizza...
for the rest of your lives.

05:09.048 --> 05:10.248
Thank havens you're home.
(Door closes)

05:10.365 --> 05:12.109
We were just sitting here
watching TV,

05:12.218 --> 05:14.047
when this rock came crashing
through the window.

05:14.153 --> 05:16.029
What? Was anyone hurt?

05:16.493 --> 05:17.333
(Exhales)

05:18.317 --> 05:20.092
Who would do
something like that?

05:20.215 --> 05:21.058
We looked outside,

05:21.179 --> 05:22.901
and we saw
the Glossners running away.

05:23.035 --> 05:24.599
One of them
was wearing a green shirt,

05:24.723 --> 05:27.706
and the other had a hole
in his jeans... (Coughs)

05:28.685 --> 05:31.291
and so on and so forth
and what have you.

05:31.411 --> 05:32.610
You sure it was the Glossners?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.179
Definitely.
I-I heard them laughing.

05:35.871 --> 05:37.501
(Slurps) I don't believe this.

05:37.622 --> 05:39.734
Why? It's all
very believable.

05:39.855 --> 05:41.759
Okay. Enough's enough, Frankie.
I'm going over there.

05:41.869 --> 05:43.037
What? Don't!

05:43.480 --> 05:44.500
Why not?

05:44.862 --> 05:47.743
Because, um, we thought
it was the Glossners,

05:47.884 --> 05:50.505
- but we also heard tires.
- Tires?

05:50.619 --> 05:52.807
Yes. Screeching away.

05:52.942 --> 05:54.295
So it could have
been someone else.

05:54.429 --> 05:56.029
Like the Maddens,

05:56.155 --> 05:57.906
or the house on
the other end of the street

05:58.042 --> 06:01.695
has that weird cousin that visits
from Des Moines. (Crunches)

06:02.123 --> 06:05.411
And so on and so forth
and what have you.

06:05.545 --> 06:07.578
So there you have it.
Could be the Glossners,

06:07.709 --> 06:09.891
could be any number of
mischievous teens, really.

06:10.041 --> 06:11.567
Guess we'll never know for sure.

06:11.878 --> 06:14.068
(Sucks air)

06:14.600 --> 06:16.207
(Whispers) - I'm--
- Done!

06:16.329 --> 06:17.436
With this one. (Laughs)

06:17.580 --> 06:20.599
Well, it is getting late,

06:20.724 --> 06:22.313
and we all have homework
to do, right, guys?

06:22.432 --> 06:23.580
- Right.
- Yes.

06:23.699 --> 06:25.816
Okay. Don't forget your dinner.

06:33.921 --> 06:35.552
I've seen enough episodes
of "Castle"

06:35.673 --> 06:38.361
to know that something
is not right in this picture.

06:38.967 --> 06:41.076
The glass is evenly laid out.

06:41.184 --> 06:42.909
The rock is placed just so.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.515
It's all a little too neat.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.021
Only in this house

06:47.155 --> 06:49.993
would broken glass all over
the floor be considered neat.

06:50.114 --> 06:51.255
Hmm.

06:59.057 --> 07:00.278
Hurry up. The bus is here.

07:00.385 --> 07:02.294
Finish your breakfast pizza.
Take your lunch pizza.

07:02.411 --> 07:04.021
Aw. I wanted pepperoni.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.263
Oh, here.
You can have mine.

07:05.368 --> 07:06.680
Oh, cool. Thanks, Sue.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.323
Uh, ooh. Sausage anyone?

07:08.423 --> 07:09.727
Ooh, I'll trade you
some plain cheese for it.

07:09.822 --> 07:11.492
Oh, thank you.
Brick, you are the man.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.301
- Thank you.
- Wait, Sue, come on. Let me help you here.

07:13.422 --> 07:15.574
- Oh, thanks, Axl.
- There you go.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.825
(Door opens and closes)
What the hell was that?

07:18.928 --> 07:19.950
I don't know.

07:20.055 --> 07:21.639
What was in those little red
tablets you gave 'em?

07:21.725 --> 07:24.328
First the window,
now being civil and kind?

07:24.442 --> 07:25.588
Something's definitely
up with them.

07:25.703 --> 07:27.934
I'm telling ya,
they're in cahoots.

07:28.065 --> 07:29.272
Hmm. Maybe it's just
a coincidence.

07:29.370 --> 07:31.745
Mm. There are
no coincidences.

07:31.865 --> 07:33.427
Only clues.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.235
"Castle"?

07:34.360 --> 07:36.350
It's a really good show, Mike.
You should watch.

07:37.256 --> 07:39.825
(Sighs) Well, don't worry.

07:39.976 --> 07:42.632
We'll get to the bottom
of this.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.766
Hi, Axl.

07:51.918 --> 07:53.762
I've been waiting for you.
(Gloves snap)

07:53.913 --> 07:56.055
What's, uh, what's going on?

07:56.161 --> 07:58.163
Why are you...
grinning like that?

07:58.300 --> 08:00.314
Well, I'm getting
my dental rotation soon,

08:00.437 --> 08:02.760
and I need to practice
so I get a good one.

08:02.889 --> 08:04.048
Have a seat.

08:04.149 --> 08:06.567
- I got a lot of homework
I gotta-- - Sit.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.569
(Blows air)

08:11.951 --> 08:14.138
Hi, dad.
What are you doing

08:14.243 --> 08:16.460
with the Disney World trip
change jar?

08:16.594 --> 08:18.302
Gotta pay
for the window somehow.

08:18.419 --> 08:21.149
You know, the one
the Glossners or whoever broke.

08:21.289 --> 08:23.041
But we've been saving up
this money for years.

08:23.165 --> 08:26.221
I-I've dreamed of Disney World
since I was a little girl.

08:26.383 --> 08:27.988
Yep. Shame.

08:28.532 --> 08:30.598
Let's start
with the quarters. (Sighs)

08:34.402 --> 08:36.657
What I'm trying
to wrap my head around is,

08:36.784 --> 08:39.916
Brick said he definitely
heard the Glossners laughing.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.812
(Mutters indistinctly)

08:41.933 --> 08:44.817
But you and Sue said
you heard tires squealing.

08:44.966 --> 08:47.724
I looked outside.
There's no tire marks.

08:47.845 --> 08:49.313
What do you make of that?

08:49.829 --> 08:51.497
I don't know. Aah.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.492
Oops. Still learning.

08:53.612 --> 08:55.249
Sure hope
that doesn't happen again.

08:55.347 --> 08:56.279
Ah...

08:56.387 --> 08:59.245
Wow. I had no idea
how close we were

08:59.359 --> 09:00.819
to affording this trip.

09:01.276 --> 09:02.467
Uh-huh.

09:02.978 --> 09:04.366
(Clinks) So close.

09:04.474 --> 09:06.849
Guess we'll just have to
start all over again.

09:07.163 --> 09:08.234
Oh, well.

09:08.345 --> 09:09.623
Oh, well!

09:09.904 --> 09:11.231
You know,
it's funny, though--

09:11.344 --> 09:13.848
you call me when there's
a ladybug in the house.

09:14.046 --> 09:15.490
But when a rock
comes through the window,

09:15.632 --> 09:16.636
no call.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.656
(Laughs nervously)

09:17.764 --> 09:19.724
I mean funny as in interesting.

09:20.271 --> 09:21.491
Right.

09:21.806 --> 09:23.335
What time...
(Clinks)

09:23.441 --> 09:25.895
did you say the rock
came through the window again?

09:26.004 --> 09:28.171
Between 7:00 and 8:00,
maybe closer to 8:00.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.920
And so on and so forth,
and what have you.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.231
I see.
And when you say,

09:33.344 --> 09:35.508
"and so on and so forth
and what have you,"

09:36.104 --> 09:38.211
what time have you?

09:38.678 --> 09:39.466
(Clinks)

09:39.606 --> 09:40.668
We done?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.681
- We can be.
- Awesome.

09:43.288 --> 09:44.456
It was Sue, wasn't it?

09:44.572 --> 09:45.591
She can be clumsy.

09:45.703 --> 09:47.949
An upturned carpet
and-- whoops! Broken window.

09:48.067 --> 09:49.192
It was Axl, wasn't it?

09:49.300 --> 09:51.012
Look, if you tell me
the truth right now,

09:51.145 --> 09:52.758
there's a pair of mouse ears
with your name on it.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.462
It wasn't Sue.
I heard two people laughing.

09:54.582 --> 09:55.644
Could have been teen vandals,

09:55.741 --> 09:56.934
could have been the Glossners,
okay?

09:57.049 --> 09:59.203
It wasn't Axl!
It was the Glossners.

09:59.351 --> 10:00.869
Or other bad teens...

10:01.078 --> 10:03.534
and so on and so forth
and what have you!

10:04.697 --> 10:06.850
The rock came through
the window at 7:42.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.533
It wasn't a car.
It was a Vespa.

10:08.632 --> 10:09.486
I'll pass it on to Brick.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.614
Okay. Pass this on, too--

10:10.741 --> 10:12.259
now there are worse things
mom can do to your mouth

10:12.360 --> 10:13.623
than make food for it.

10:14.035 --> 10:15.778
<i>Having bombed out</i>
<i>with Axl and Sue,</i>

10:15.902 --> 10:18.013
<i>Mike and I played</i>
<i>the only card we had left.</i>

10:18.117 --> 10:19.026
Where you guys going?

10:19.125 --> 10:21.615
Nowhere. Just taking
Brick out for ice cream.

10:22.329 --> 10:24.874
Um, I would actually
love some ice cream.

10:25.019 --> 10:27.308
No, not you guys. Just Brick.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:38.467 --> 10:40.472
10 bucks on toppings.

10:40.705 --> 10:42.361
He goes for all
the heavy stuff--

10:42.482 --> 10:44.979
the brownie bits,
gummi bears, circus cookies--

10:45.102 --> 10:47.429
and nothing.
He won't admit to anything.

10:47.538 --> 10:49.367
(Mutters indistinctly)

10:49.481 --> 10:50.846
I don't know.
I just don't get it.

10:50.957 --> 10:52.821
Why are these kids
protecting each other?

10:53.107 --> 10:55.320
Remember, ladies and... Scott,

10:55.535 --> 10:58.086
today's work will
determine your rotation spot.

10:58.379 --> 11:01.285
Do well, you'll be teaching
kindergarteners how to floss.

11:01.563 --> 11:02.800
Do badly....

11:03.151 --> 11:05.571
let's just say there are places
I wouldn't put my hands

11:05.701 --> 11:07.476
with ten gloves on.

11:07.938 --> 11:10.216
(Scoffs)
I hope I get a good rotation.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.511
Mrs. Armwood and I
got off to a rocky start,

11:12.632 --> 11:14.470
- and now it's like she's always up my--
- Frankie.

11:14.573 --> 11:15.437
(Clank)Aah!

11:15.537 --> 11:17.013
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

11:17.111 --> 11:17.813
Are you okay--

11:17.905 --> 11:19.268
(Squish) Ugh!

11:22.407 --> 11:24.463
You know, lying is easier
that I thought it would be,

11:24.614 --> 11:26.289
and I got ice cream.

11:26.498 --> 11:29.027
Clearly, we've been playing
it wrong all these years.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.216
(Mouth full) What do you mean?

11:30.337 --> 11:32.830
What I mean is that together,
we are awesome.

11:32.952 --> 11:35.646
But alone,
only I am still awesome.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.587
- Huh? - They made a huge mistake
when they had three kids.

11:38.874 --> 11:41.203
We outnumber them.
So as long as we stick together,

11:41.593 --> 11:44.237
we get stronger,
and they get weaker.

11:44.327 --> 11:45.767
There's nothing we can't do.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.513
We don't want to clean
a garage this weekend?

11:47.641 --> 11:48.749
We don't like
what's for dinner?

11:48.864 --> 11:50.414
We wanna sell mom
to a rich man?

11:50.510 --> 11:51.619
We can do it.

11:51.734 --> 11:53.941
(Frankie) Guys?
Can you come out here, please?

11:54.136 --> 11:56.071
Should we?
What do you think?

11:56.242 --> 11:58.014
Eh. Why not
throw her a bone?

12:01.502 --> 12:02.592
What is that?

12:02.694 --> 12:03.865
It's from the church van.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.315
The gift that keeps on givin'.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.892
We like to call it
the wheel of pain.

12:08.023 --> 12:09.426
See, your dad and I know

12:09.545 --> 12:11.744
that you've all been lying
about the window.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.275
And since no one has fessed up

12:13.386 --> 12:15.013
and received
their fair punishment,

12:15.154 --> 12:18.968
we're gonna let the wheel decide
who gets punished randomly.

12:19.258 --> 12:22.462
Unless somebody wants to step up
and admit anything?

12:23.776 --> 12:24.942
No.

12:25.064 --> 12:27.327
- No.
- Nothing to admit.

12:27.452 --> 12:29.149
Okay, then.
Time to play.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.520
Mike, why don't you
tell us the categories?

12:31.647 --> 12:35.566
Thanks, Frankie. We have "8 P.M.
curfew"... (Clacks)

12:36.185 --> 12:37.694
"No reading"...
(Clacks)

12:38.458 --> 12:40.579
And "no birthday party."

12:40.691 --> 12:42.368
Ooh. I hope I get
"no reading."

12:42.476 --> 12:44.314
Come on, "no reading."
Whoo!

12:44.422 --> 12:47.154
That's not how
the wheel of pain works, Axl.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.556
"No reading" would be
Brick's punishment

12:49.681 --> 12:51.264
should the wheel land on it.

12:51.376 --> 12:53.529
Your punishment
would be "8 P.M. curfew."

12:53.635 --> 12:56.303
So wait. If it lands
on "no birthday party,"

12:56.482 --> 12:59.782
that means I lose
my "Sue-weet 16"?

12:59.889 --> 13:01.402
See? Sue gets it.

13:01.493 --> 13:05.125
No. It only happens
once in a person's life.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.021
That's so unfair.

13:07.162 --> 13:10.547
Everyone has the same 1-in-3
chance to get punished, Sue.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.031
But again, we don't
have to spin at all,

13:13.191 --> 13:15.779
if someone comes forward.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.547
No? Okay.

13:18.682 --> 13:21.163
Well, Mike, let 'er rip.

13:22.199 --> 13:24.926
(Clacking) Round and round
and round she goes.

13:25.036 --> 13:28.171
Where she stops, nobody knows.

13:28.276 --> 13:30.033
- No birthday party.
- Oh, my God!

13:30.153 --> 13:31.548
O-o-okay. Y-you know what?

13:31.669 --> 13:34.342
That was just a practice spin
to show how it works.

13:34.444 --> 13:35.732
- You can't change the rules!
- That's not fair.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.821
Let's do it
for real this time. Mike?

13:37.931 --> 13:38.901
Yeah.

13:39.057 --> 13:41.450
(Clacking) Round and round
and round she goes.

13:41.985 --> 13:45.518
Where she stops, no...

13:45.898 --> 13:47.287
birthday party.

13:47.425 --> 13:50.186
Again? No! It's rigged!

13:50.287 --> 13:51.554
It's not rigged, Sue.

13:51.669 --> 13:54.630
Then how come the wheel of pain
always lands on me?

13:54.730 --> 13:56.006
Tonight, or life in general?

13:56.114 --> 13:58.354
Okay. This is the one
that really counts.

13:58.474 --> 13:59.937
No more do-overs.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.083
(Blows air)

14:01.452 --> 14:04.358
(Clacking) Round and round,
and, uh, you get it.

14:04.515 --> 14:06.590
(Clacking continues)

14:12.935 --> 14:17.787
<i>No!</i>

14:22.742 --> 14:24.438
I can't lose my party.

14:24.599 --> 14:26.303
It's my Sweet 16.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.072
It's the only birthday
that has its own adjective.

14:29.193 --> 14:31.041
Man, they are really
playing hardball.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.442
Got to admit, I did not
see that one coming. (Chuckles)

14:33.717 --> 14:35.203
Oh, well.

14:35.865 --> 14:36.958
"Oh, well"?

14:37.047 --> 14:38.105
That's all you have to say?

14:38.201 --> 14:40.660
You promised nothing bad would
happen if we stuck together,

14:40.799 --> 14:42.908
and now the worst possible thing
is happening,

14:43.034 --> 14:44.761
and it's only happening to me!

14:44.882 --> 14:46.572
Taking one for the team, Sue--
there's no higher honor.

14:46.702 --> 14:47.715
Screw the team!

14:47.883 --> 14:49.233
I am gonna tell them
what really happened!

14:49.364 --> 14:51.770
It is the only way
to get my "Sue-weet 16" back!

14:51.901 --> 14:53.379
Sue, relax.
You're gonna get your party.

14:53.661 --> 14:54.669
How can you know that?

14:54.789 --> 14:56.617
'Cause mom caves.
She's a caver.

14:56.754 --> 14:58.108
Axl's got a point, Sue.

14:58.226 --> 15:00.024
Mom's all threat,
no follow-through.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.796
She's just
a toothless old tiger.

15:02.723 --> 15:03.971
You should have
heard 'em, Mike.

15:04.065 --> 15:05.634
Saying that
I don't follow through.

15:05.753 --> 15:07.446
That I'm a toothless old tiger.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.935
Does that sound like me?

15:09.785 --> 15:11.525
What, you don't think
I have follow-through?

15:11.649 --> 15:13.085
I have follow-through.

15:13.659 --> 15:14.302
(Dog barking in distance)

15:14.417 --> 15:16.571
I get tired, okay?
They wear me down.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.894
So this time,
stick to your guns.

15:19.014 --> 15:20.453
Show 'em the tiger
still has teeth.

15:20.564 --> 15:22.141
But it's Sue's Sweet 16.

15:22.266 --> 15:23.802
I can't take that
away from her.

15:23.887 --> 15:25.007
Then why'd you make the threat?

15:25.103 --> 15:26.644
'Cause we're not allowed
to hit 'em.

15:26.747 --> 15:28.289
If you didn't want
to take away Sue's party,

15:28.393 --> 15:30.299
you never should have put it
on the wheel of pain.

15:30.661 --> 15:33.426
I was just so sure
it was gonna land on Axl.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.807
I kind of made his slice
a little bigger.

15:36.422 --> 15:38.095
(Sighs) What if
it was the Glossners,

15:38.233 --> 15:40.194
and I'm punishing Sue
for nothing?

15:40.369 --> 15:42.550
(Exhales)
Okay. I won't cave.

15:53.527 --> 15:55.446
<i>So I was stuck</i>
<i>sticking to my guns,</i>

15:55.591 --> 15:56.808
<i>but as the days passed,</i>

15:56.939 --> 15:58.946
<i>Sue wasn't making it</i>
<i>any easier.</i>

16:00.684 --> 16:01.835
Hey, mom.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.762
Uh, are we doing anything
for my birthday tomorrow?

16:04.910 --> 16:08.092
I mean, I know I'm not having
a party, and I get it,

16:08.439 --> 16:10.171
but I just wondered if we were, like,

16:10.284 --> 16:12.993
having dinner as a family or something?

16:13.252 --> 16:14.796
Not that we have to.

16:16.369 --> 16:18.436
Mike, I think I figured it out.

16:18.568 --> 16:19.946
You know, it just hit me--

16:20.266 --> 16:22.383
I own a lot of plaid.

16:22.673 --> 16:23.546
Sorry. What?

16:23.662 --> 16:25.604
I figured out how to give
Sue back her Sweet 16

16:25.727 --> 16:27.824
without looking like a spineless caver.

16:27.942 --> 16:28.851
How?

16:28.957 --> 16:31.362
You be the spineless caver. Hear me out.

16:31.484 --> 16:34.122
If you let her have the party,
supposedly against my wishes,

16:34.236 --> 16:35.735
then it's not really caving for you,

16:35.845 --> 16:37.302
because you didn't make the threat.

16:37.436 --> 16:39.726
And that way, we both get what we want.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.114
And what is that again?

16:41.227 --> 16:42.907
To maintain our authority as parents

16:43.024 --> 16:44.807
but still let Sue have the party.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.771
And what's this have
to do with the window?

16:46.891 --> 16:48.286
Ugh. Keep up, Mike.

16:48.387 --> 16:51.092
It stopped being about
the window a week ago.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.040
Fine, Mike, have it your way.

16:55.157 --> 16:57.495
Oh, Sue's right here. Go ahead. Tell her.

16:57.605 --> 16:59.296
Tell her what you just told me.

16:59.475 --> 17:00.640
Tell me what?

17:00.767 --> 17:02.506
Well, apparently, your father thinks

17:02.621 --> 17:03.859
that I'm being unreasonable,

17:03.979 --> 17:05.372
and that you should have your party,

17:05.501 --> 17:07.852
and it doesn't seem to matter what I say.

17:08.154 --> 17:09.665
- Really?
- Yep.

17:09.781 --> 17:10.965
He said a girl's Sweet 16

17:11.097 --> 17:12.950
is just too important to take away.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.553
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

17:14.688 --> 17:16.242
Personally, I think follow-through

17:16.368 --> 17:18.970
is more important, 'cause I'm
all about the follow-through.

17:19.117 --> 17:21.858
But your dad's overruling me, I guess.

17:21.997 --> 17:25.362
Yep. When I see a wrong, I right it.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.579
Aha! Ha ha!

17:27.874 --> 17:29.733
Oh-ho! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

17:29.841 --> 17:32.172
Thank you! Thank you! I
love you so much, dad!

17:32.520 --> 17:33.825
Mother.

17:37.543 --> 17:39.310
That's right, Sue. For your gift,

17:39.440 --> 17:42.939
you, me, and my mom have
rear mezzanine seats

17:43.051 --> 17:46.349
to see Debbie Reynolds in "Sugar Babies"!

17:46.468 --> 17:47.995
- Aah!
- Aah!

17:48.110 --> 17:50.220
I don't know what that is,
but it sounds amazing!

17:50.342 --> 17:51.919
- Aah!
- Aah!

17:52.112 --> 17:53.283
Thanks, Brad!

17:53.926 --> 17:54.899
I know this sounds bad,

17:55.023 --> 17:57.436
but I hope your mom's vertigo
comes back so I can go.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.766
(Laughs)

17:59.112 --> 18:01.527
I thought the world was
going to end on Thursday,

18:01.670 --> 18:05.175
so I didn't get you anything.
It felt impractical.

18:05.323 --> 18:06.685
That's okay.

18:06.837 --> 18:07.917
I got you this coupon

18:08.025 --> 18:09.997
for one free beat-up of the
person of your choice.

18:10.104 --> 18:12.168
You can watch or not. It's your call.

18:12.757 --> 18:16.982
Thanks so much, Becky. That's so sweet.

18:18.824 --> 18:20.704
I'm just gonna go check
on the hors d'oeuvres.

18:21.410 --> 18:24.083
(Pop music playing)

18:24.197 --> 18:25.214
Hey, mom.

18:25.316 --> 18:29.112
I know you and dad have sort of
been at odds about my party.

18:29.224 --> 18:31.441
But I am having a really good time,

18:31.557 --> 18:33.638
so I hope you guys are over it.

18:33.763 --> 18:36.061
Well, we're not. I'm
still really mad at him,

18:36.174 --> 18:39.841
because this is absolutely the
opposite of what I wanted.

18:40.211 --> 18:43.111
Okay, everybody! Time for birthday cake!

18:44.455 --> 18:45.821
Hi, Axl. (Sighs)

18:45.908 --> 18:47.121
Prom's in two months.

18:47.238 --> 18:48.473
Yeah. (Chuckles)

18:48.607 --> 18:50.775
Um, you know I'm dating Cassidy, right?

18:50.898 --> 18:53.075
So... probably taking her.

18:53.184 --> 18:55.568
Oh. Cassidy seems really nice.

18:56.127 --> 18:59.329
Can you get me a strand of her hair?

19:00.127 --> 19:01.157
(Exhales)

19:01.363 --> 19:02.808
(Frankie) Okay. There we go.

19:03.149 --> 19:05.115
(Under breath) Told you she'd cave.

19:05.380 --> 19:06.357
I heard that, Axl.

19:06.468 --> 19:08.301
- ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪
- And for your information, I did not cave.

19:08.412 --> 19:10.198
Your father steamrolled me.

19:10.307 --> 19:12.062
- ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪
- Yep. That's what I do.

19:12.204 --> 19:14.134
I put my foot down and
showed her who's boss.

19:14.239 --> 19:16.334
Don't mess with me, Mike.
I am still pissed.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.227
And you know what?
I am not talking to you.

19:18.351 --> 19:21.549
Mm. Sue's birthday, and I got the gift.

19:22.136 --> 19:25.258
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

19:26.598 --> 19:28.131
Make a wish, Sue.

19:28.248 --> 19:29.833
I wish my parents would stop fighting,

19:29.948 --> 19:31.347
and everything would go
back to the way it was

19:31.442 --> 19:34.018
before I drove a wedge between them.
(Blows air)

19:34.127 --> 19:35.392
What? Oh, Sue.

19:35.490 --> 19:37.620
You guys are obviously
so mad at each other,

19:37.737 --> 19:39.427
and you're probably gonna get a divorce,

19:39.546 --> 19:41.273
and it'll be all my fault.

19:41.373 --> 19:42.872
No, Sue, it's not your fault, 'cause--

19:42.960 --> 19:45.678
Wait. It's not my fault.

19:46.195 --> 19:48.344
It's all our faults.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.577
We did it. We're the ones
who broke the window.

19:50.679 --> 19:52.417
That's not true. She's lying.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.474
(Whispers) I'm lying.

19:53.579 --> 19:56.256
No. I am not taking the
fall for you guys anymore.

19:56.406 --> 19:59.656
We all broke the window, and
we blamed the Glossners,

19:59.809 --> 20:02.750
and we lied. And we lied.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.398
So there it was--

20:04.506 --> 20:06.376
the confession I'd been waiting for,

20:06.604 --> 20:09.222
but it wasn't quite as
satisfying as I'd hoped.

20:09.490 --> 20:13.345
I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry for everything.

20:14.126 --> 20:16.550
This was supposed to be my Sweet 16,

20:16.711 --> 20:18.254
and it's not sweet at all.

20:18.364 --> 20:22.328
It's sour. This is a Sour 16.

20:22.743 --> 20:26.365
No, Sue, wait. Your dad
and I aren't fighting.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.020
We just made it up so you
could have your party.

20:29.225 --> 20:31.305
So you're not getting a divorce?

20:31.418 --> 20:32.769
Not today.

20:33.207 --> 20:35.319
(Exhales) Really?

20:35.678 --> 20:39.880
Then this truly is the
sweetest Sweet 16 ever.

20:40.024 --> 20:43.260
Because first it was sweet,
and then it was sour,

20:43.398 --> 20:45.917
and now it's sweet again,
which, when you think about it,

20:46.097 --> 20:48.945
only makes it even sweeter.

20:49.433 --> 20:50.662
(Laughter)

20:51.300 --> 20:52.594
I guess Sue was right.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.205
Having the sour moments in life

20:54.343 --> 20:56.546
really does make the sweet ones sweeter.

20:57.044 --> 20:58.483
(Indistinct conversations)

20:58.923 --> 21:00.254
At least I hope so.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.548
'Cause turns out the only
one with any follow-through

21:02.658 --> 21:03.955
was Mrs. Armwood.

21:04.059 --> 21:06.768
And her wheel of pain landed right on me.

21:06.869 --> 21:09.359
(Buzzer in distance) Yep. My kids
did the crime, and I did the time.

21:09.466 --> 21:11.150
Yeah, I probably should have punished 'em,

21:11.281 --> 21:12.501
but then it was sort of nice

21:12.610 --> 21:14.380
the way they were all
sticking up for each other.

21:14.475 --> 21:15.650
Uh, wider, please.

21:15.971 --> 21:18.260
Yeah, so the next time
they try to pull anything,

21:18.366 --> 21:21.171
I will definitely follow through.

21:21.576 --> 21:23.079
How was your mom about this?

21:23.179 --> 21:25.216
Well, obviously not that
great with where you are.

21:25.337 --> 21:26.484
(Laughs) I'm just kidding.
