00:17.380 --> 00:20.713
*

00:20.750 --> 00:23.344
What was that?

00:23.390 --> 00:24.311
What?

00:24.350 --> 00:26.011
You nodded. What part?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.409
Alicia.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.055
*

00:34.260 --> 00:36.262
(loud crinkling)

00:40.540 --> 00:41.768
(sighs): Okay.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.131
(exhales):
You hated it.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.434
No, I...
Self-serving?

00:45.470 --> 00:47.631
No, it's, uh...
Bodng.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.069
I'm... sorry.
Go ahead.

00:50.110 --> 00:51.577
It's dry.

00:51.610 --> 00:54.249
Oh, my God, Cary, I spent
two weeks on that speech.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.816
Yeah, and it feels like
you spent two weeks on it.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.410
I have to give
this speech tomorrow.
So rewrite it.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.315
They didn't ask you
because you're an expert

01:00.360 --> 01:01.850
(phone ringing)
on opt-out moms.

01:01.890 --> 01:05.155
They asked you because
you we an opt-out mom.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.822
Clarke, where are you?

01:08.860 --> 01:10.396
In traffic.

01:10.430 --> 01:13.137
BILL DE BLASIO: (on video):
New York is the city
of endless possibilities.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.764
(getting louder):
It's a different adventure
every day and every minute.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.267
Excuse me,
how do I turn this down?

01:17.310 --> 01:19.574
No, no, cars in front.
Cannot turn right.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.147
(video continues loudly)
Sorry. Rayna Hecht called.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.444
She wants to have
the meeting now.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.378
She what?

01:25.410 --> 01:27.412
She wants to have
the meeting rIght now!

01:27.450 --> 01:29.782
Not tonight.
And I'm stuck in traffic.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.414
Uh... Rayna Hecht wants
to meet right now.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.358
What? Why?

01:33.390 --> 01:34.516
Clarke, we're not ready.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.881
We are ready.
Just tell her about the firm.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.579
She doesn't care about our size.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.757
She wants to go someplace
with a future.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.495
She'd down in the lounge.
She's waiting right now.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.792
We got to go.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.320
Cary, listen to me.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.760
She brings a full portfolio
of clients with her.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.667
Over $60 million a year
in billing. We need her.

01:51.710 --> 01:54.304
She is the very definition
of a rainmaker.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.308
What? Clarke...

01:56.350 --> 01:58.204
can you turn
down your TV?

01:58.250 --> 01:59.877
I'm trying, but the mayor

01:59.920 --> 02:01.740
won't stop talking.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.680
But I guarantee you...

02:03.720 --> 02:06.359
(relieved sigh)

02:06.390 --> 02:08.415
Rayna Hecht is a rainmaker.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.451
We need her.
Every firm in Chicago...

02:10.490 --> 02:12.424
(on video):
New York is the city

02:12.460 --> 02:14.894
of endless possibilities.
It's a different adventure...
And he's back.

02:14.930 --> 02:17.763
I can't hear you,
all right? I'm gonna have
to call you back. Bye.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.291
(groans) Why am I
having so much trouble
with this speech?

02:20.340 --> 02:22.467
Look, look, look.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.637
It's the keynote
speech at the ABA,

02:24.670 --> 02:26.934
and you're trying to
impress people. Don't.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.949
They don't want to hear
facts and figures-- they
want to hear your story.

02:29.980 --> 02:33.939
You went from an opt-out mom
to the partner in a law firm

02:33.980 --> 02:35.709
in four years.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.388
That's your speech.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.456
Thanks.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.886
CARY:
There.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.488
Every lawyer is after her.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.599
Great.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.461
Can you believe this?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.468
I'll be honest.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.468
I like you guys. I do.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.298
And I do intend to decide
in the next 48 hours.

02:58.340 --> 03:02.709
But I want a partnership
that I can believe in.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.241
I'm leaving Hartley & Jenner
because of the indictments.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.818
If you're worried about
my suspension a few years ago,

03:08.850 --> 03:11.819
that's past, and I'm
a better lawyer for it.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.886
Good pitch.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.955
Thanks.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.823
Okay, well, let me get
my little ducks in a row,

03:17.860 --> 03:20.249
and we'll talk.
Thank you, Ms. Hecht.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.756
Thank you.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.097
DIANE:
So, you're

03:23.130 --> 03:26.258
a big firm now--
making a presence at the ABA?
CARY: Out shaking

03:26.300 --> 03:27.494
the trees, just like you.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.428
Good luck with the
keynote tomorrow.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.767
Don't let him
get in your head.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.765
Ms. Hecht, hello.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.004
I'm Cary Agos.
Alicia Florrick.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.530
Hey. I'm sorry if
I don't sit down,

03:34.580 --> 03:36.445
but I need to make
a few calls. Um,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.903
why don't we do
this another time?
Good to meet you.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.315
What happened?

03:41.350 --> 03:42.840
We lost our slot.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.517
She'll vet us.
We're good.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.586
No one's unde_r indictment.
Damian.

03:46.620 --> 03:49.009
He's not
under indictment.
Well, we want her.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.426
$60 million in
client billing.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.293
You coming?
Uh, no,
I'll see you later.

03:54.330 --> 03:55.797
(clearing throat)

03:55.830 --> 03:58.424
Lot of lavwers
at this thing, huh?

03:58.470 --> 04:01.337
Do you have a minute?
No.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.565
I can take my time,
Mr. Gardner.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.566
I was on
the Blagojevich case.

04:05.610 --> 04:08.670
We always knew
that sooner or later
the lavwers would talk.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.940
They want to talk;
they need to talk.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.017
They know that
attorney-client privilege
only gets them so far.

04:14.050 --> 04:16.746
Earplugs, please.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.439
The problem you have,
Mr. Gardner,

04:18.490 --> 04:19.855
is that voter fraud is

04:19.890 --> 04:21.551
an ongoing crime,
a conspiracy.

04:21.590 --> 04:23.956
If you're protecting
the governor, you're
just as guilty.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.651
That's why you'll talk.

04:25.690 --> 04:27.726
The governor is
not your friend.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.729
No one-- no judge or
disciplinary body--

04:30.770 --> 04:32.965
will blame you for breaking
attorney-client privilege.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.867
(laughs): You can't freeze
me out, Mr. Gardner.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.663
I'm an agent of the Office
of Public Integrity.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.270
I have
subpoena power.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

04:45.050 --> 04:48.019
I'll get on with
Clarke, see if we can
set up another time.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.939
Okay, and I will get on
with Robyn and have her
look into her background.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.084
No, no, no, you go
back to your room and
you work on your speech.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.985
Cary, it'll only
take a_minute...
AllCla...

04:56.020 --> 04:57.885
you're procrastinating.

04:57.930 --> 05:01.058
Go back to your room
and work on your keynote.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.898
Okay? Remember,
personal stories.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.791
Robyn, what are you doing?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.831
*

05:22.150 --> 05:23.549
Just...

05:23.590 --> 05:26.309
write anything down.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.792
(sighs)

05:44.140 --> 05:46.108
Mrs. Alicia Florrick.

05:46.140 --> 05:48.438
Hi. I'm Lorainne Joy.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.742
Thank you for
coming in.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.907
Oh, thank you for
inviting me in, Ms. Joy.

05:51.950 --> 05:52.974
How could I not?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.545
Your name just sort of
popped out at me. (laughs)

05:55.580 --> 05:58.481
Oh, my God,
your husband.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.681
(grunts)
If my husband did that to me...

06:00.720 --> 06:03.029
look, I don't know
what I would do.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.550
Thank you.
No, I know what
I would do.

06:04.590 --> 06:06.751
I would... probably
scratch his eyes out.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.688
(laughs):
That's what I would do.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.960
Oh... you don't need
to give me a rsum.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.390
(sighs)
Just tell me about yourself.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.670
When did you last
practice law?

06:20.840 --> 06:23.638
Well, officially...
(laughs softly)

06:23.680 --> 06:25.648
13 years ago.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.719
But... I helped advise
on a lot of cases.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.047
On your husband's cases?

06:31.090 --> 06:33.183
Yes.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.983
Uh-huh. Well, good.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.112
(inhales)

06:36.160 --> 06:39.755
Listen, here's the
thing... Alicia.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.995
LORAINNE: We don't really have
any positions available

06:42.030 --> 06:43.429
at the moment.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.165
I know--
the position we have

06:45.200 --> 06:47.430
is for starting associate.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.807
Oh, well, I'm...
I'm open for that.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.206
No. That wouldn't
really be appropriate.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.969
You know, we make a big play

06:55.010 --> 06:57.501
for the Ivy League pool
for that, so...

06:57.550 --> 06:58.699
(typing)

06:58.750 --> 07:00.945
(elevator bell dings)

07:00.980 --> 07:03.448
(indistinct chatter nearby)

07:10.260 --> 07:12.125
(elevator bell dings)

07:12.160 --> 07:14.628
(indistinct chatter continues)

07:21.600 --> 07:23.602
Alicia Florrick.

07:25.710 --> 07:28.201
When can you start?

07:29.240 --> 07:32.141
What? When can I...
start work?

07:32.180 --> 07:34.011
Yes. You want to work here?

07:34.050 --> 07:36.109
I do. Uh, um, now.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.880
I'm... Tomorrow,
if you'd like.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.081
Good. Uh, come on back in,

07:41.120 --> 07:42.883
and I'll assign you a desk.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.228
(exhales)

07:46.230 --> 07:47.993
(elevator bell dings)

07:48.030 --> 07:50.863
(quietly):
Yeah!

07:54.600 --> 07:56.238
Mm.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.942
(clears throat softly)

08:07.580 --> 08:11.084
*

08:11.120 --> 08:14.954
WOMAN:
It doesn't officially show
till Wednesday.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.628
ALICIA:
How much?

08:16.660 --> 08:19.185
Well, I warned you you'd
fall in love with it.

08:19.230 --> 08:21.289
It's not really in your range.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.729
I have a job now.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.965
My range has changed.
How many rooms?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.865
Three. Two baths and a maid's.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.061
*

08:29.100 --> 08:31.261
I love the light.
The windows are great.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.528
I have a three-
bedroom on 5th.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.207
It's half this rent.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.549
I like this.

08:42.180 --> 08:45.047
ALICIA:
I'm... I'm sorry. What?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.719
It's a paralegal job.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.593
Mr. Acocella, I'm sorry, but...

08:52.630 --> 08:55.599
I... H thought
it was an associate position.

08:55.630 --> 08:57.268
Yes, I know,
but it's

08:57.300 --> 09:00.269
more of an internship.

09:00.300 --> 09:04.737
Mr. Acocella, I made plans
based on that understanding.

09:04.770 --> 09:06.670
I made... financial outlays...

09:06.710 --> 09:08.678
I'm sorry.

09:10.110 --> 09:13.170
I... told the partners.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.745
They were worried
about your last name.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.749
They don't want you
here as an associate.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.087
I need a paycheck.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.758
I'm sorry.

09:21.790 --> 09:23.781
(elevator bell dings)

09:26.660 --> 09:28.651
(quiet sobbing)

09:31.970 --> 09:33.790
(groans)

09:35.340 --> 09:37.558
(sniffles, exhales)

09:43.180 --> 09:45.171
(panﬁng)

09:50.390 --> 09:52.346
(exhales, sniffles)

09:52.390 --> 09:54.585
(auto-dialing)

09:57.760 --> 10:00.092
Marina, it's Alicia.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.862
The apartment...

10:05.670 --> 10:09.060
Is there any way
to get out of the lease?

10:11.110 --> 10:13.271
(sighs)

10:20.820 --> 10:24.085
(elevator bell dings)

10:33.060 --> 10:35.051
(ringtone plays)

10:36.870 --> 10:39.430
(clears throat)

10:39.470 --> 10:41.438
Hello.

10:41.470 --> 10:45.702
Yeah. Uh, I-I forgot.
I'll be right down.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.776
What is the key to litigation?

10:47.810 --> 10:50.301
What is it?
Who was that man
by the elevator?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.840
What man?

10:51.880 --> 10:54.872
Have we stopped
trusting each other?

10:58.990 --> 11:00.958
Nelson Dubeck.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.958
Office of Public Integrity.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.959
They're pursuing
a case against...

11:05.990 --> 11:08.026
the governor.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.062
The ballot box?

11:12.870 --> 11:15.691
Why you and not me?

11:15.740 --> 11:18.038
There's a
surveillance tape.

11:18.070 --> 11:21.676
Smoking gun. I took it
to Peter Florrick.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.373
What are you going to do?
Unfortunately,
Mr. Pling

11:26.410 --> 11:28.241
couldn't make it
because of the hurricane

11:28.280 --> 11:30.384
I don't know.
but another litigator
has agreed to step in.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.718
Please welcome a new voice
to this ABA meeting,

11:32.760 --> 11:36.150
Elizabeth, uh... Elsbeth

11:36.190 --> 11:37.487
Tascioni.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.418
Hi!
(chuckles)

11:39.460 --> 11:40.757
Oh...
(applause)

11:40.800 --> 11:42.290
ELSBETH:
Sorry.

11:42.330 --> 11:45.322
Hello. Whoa.

11:45.370 --> 11:46.997
Sorry.
(chuckles)

11:47.040 --> 11:50.203
Okay.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.403
Okay. Um,
what is my approach...

11:53.440 --> 11:55.738
to litigation?
Well...

11:55.780 --> 11:59.739
No. Will, no.
Okay... (clears throat)

11:59.780 --> 12:01.441
Sorry. I want everybody
to close

12:01.480 --> 12:04.278
their eyes and picture a pillow,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.117
a big pillow,
the size

12:06.150 --> 12:10.052
of this room, and you're lying
in the middle of it.

12:10.090 --> 12:12.923
Now, take off
your shoes.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.428
MAN:
Then I'll give
a brief introduction,

12:15.460 --> 12:17.291
and you'll enter
from that wing over there.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.866
ALICIA:
You sure there'll be
this many people?

12:18.900 --> 12:21.391
Oh, yes. We've had great
interest in your keynote.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.931
Now, is there anything
you'll need tomorrow?

12:23.970 --> 12:25.801
A speech.
(chuckles)

12:25.840 --> 12:29.378
No, I meant... bottled water?

12:29.410 --> 12:31.241
CARY:
Alicia.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.510
We have a reprieve
with Rayna Hecht.

12:33.550 --> 12:35.745
It's Clarke.

12:36.550 --> 12:38.518
Hello? Mr. Hayden?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.552
I can't hear you.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.979
(video playing loudly)
Alicia? Hello?

12:43.030 --> 12:44.782
BILL DE BLASIO: If fashion's
your thing, you'll find

12:44.830 --> 12:46.991
the best shopping in the world,

12:47.030 --> 12:49.965
SoHo, Chelsea,
Greenwich Village...
How's that?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.798
Better.
I just talked with Rayna Hecht.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.138
She wanted to apologize
for her abruptness.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.138
She didn't know you were you.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.536
I was me? _
The governor's Wife.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.538
She's coming to your keynote.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.400
She can't wait to hear
what you'll say.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.077
The speech.
Did he tell you

13:05.110 --> 13:06.304
that the speech matters?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.818
You need to do a good job
with your keynote.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.545
She wants to wait
to decide whether to meet

13:10.590 --> 13:12.217
until after the keynote.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.218
And that's the most
I've ever said "keynote"

13:14.260 --> 13:15.557
in my entire life.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.558
So how's the
speech coming?

13:19.590 --> 13:22.024
Alicia? Hello?

13:22.060 --> 13:24.893
Clarke?
Where are you?

13:26.100 --> 13:28.489
Okay, Clarke,
I-I can't hear.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.531
Where are you?

13:56.300 --> 13:57.927
(elevator bell dings)

14:01.170 --> 14:02.535
Hey.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.561
Hey.

14:05.210 --> 14:06.507
(chuckles)
Alicia Florrick.

14:06.540 --> 14:08.508
I haven't seen you
since Georgetown.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.441
Another life ago.
You work here?

14:11.480 --> 14:14.176
In this building? No.
On Madison. What about you?

14:14.220 --> 14:15.039
I just got a job.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.389
You did? Really? Where?
Wells & Brolin.

14:17.420 --> 14:18.648
That's a good firm.
Congratulations.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.555
Thanks.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.984
Nice shoes.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.351
A baby threw up on my shoes.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.992
Ah.
(elevator bell dings)

14:29.030 --> 14:31.919
You going to the garage?
Yes. You?

14:31.970 --> 14:33.631
Uh, deposition.

14:33.670 --> 14:36.594
It was nice seeing you.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.460
And, hey, uh...

14:38.510 --> 14:41.138
I'm sorry about all that crap
with your husband.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.068
Thanks. It'll die down.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.908
It will.
(elevator bell dings)

14:49.680 --> 14:51.545
Call me sometime.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.012
Stern, Lockhart
& Gardner.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.517
Hey. You got top billing.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.051
Mm, I'm an impressive person.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.058
I never doubted it for a minute.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.092
It was good seeing you.
You, too.

15:33.660 --> 15:36.197
(clicks tongue)

15:41.600 --> 15:43.602
(sighs)

15:47.610 --> 15:50.704
(chuckles)
Oh, thank you so much.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.706
I love bears.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.445
(camera shutter sound effect)
(chuckles)

15:54.480 --> 15:58.439
Um, can I just
have one hug? Okay?

15:58.490 --> 16:01.459
You dirty Jew.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.378
Excuse me?

16:03.430 --> 16:06.251
You dirty stinking Jew.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.997
Did you just call me
a dirty stinking Jew?

16:09.030 --> 16:10.668
What, are you deaf?

16:10.700 --> 16:12.327
Oh, my God.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.997
Elsbeth, thanks
for meeting me out here.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.496
There's too many lavwers
at the hotel.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.737
Did you hear that? That bear
just called me a dirty Jew.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.577
What?
That bear there.

16:23.610 --> 16:27.068
He said I was a dirty stinking
Jew. Watch out! That bear is...

16:27.120 --> 16:28.747
anti-Semitic!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.543
Elsbeth, look,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.546
ab-about my situation.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.558
I've been subpoenaed
by Nelson Dubeck,

16:34.590 --> 16:36.683
the Office of Public Integrity,
and he's using it to pressure me

16:36.720 --> 16:38.358
to get to Peter Florrick.

16:38.390 --> 16:39.755
But it would mean breaking
attorney-client privilege.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.553
Right.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.661
If you testify against Governor
Florrick, you risk disbarment.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.191
But if you don't,
you risk contempt of court.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.537
Right.
Notgood.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.231
It's that one percent
doctrine.

16:51.270 --> 16:52.362
Hey, watch out for that bear!

16:52.410 --> 16:55.573
The what?
One percent.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.579
If you're even one percent
vulnerable, you're vulnerable.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.316
Who got you this video?

17:00.350 --> 17:01.817
Kalinda.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.681
Good. Good.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.540
I'll call her. I like Kalinda.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.182
Hey. Are you with that bear?

17:07.220 --> 17:10.189
Because I think someone needs
to talk to him.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.199
S-So you'll represent me
on this?

17:13.230 --> 17:15.653
This Dubeck guy,
he's at the hotel?

17:15.700 --> 17:18.669
Yes.
Good. Okay,
yes. Okay.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.488
I'm feeling a bit vulnerable,
but I'm gonna use it.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.700
(phone rings)

17:23.740 --> 17:25.162
Yeah.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.337
Kalinda, it's Will.
How are things there?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.678
MAN: Pass it here.
Uh... yeah, they're fine.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.349
Things are different
when the lawyers are gone.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.575
Kalinda, we need your help
on something. This is Elsbeth.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.839
Kalinda.
Kalinda, hi. Oh, I miss you.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.811
I miss you, too, Elsbeth.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.215
Can you look into someone

17:40.260 --> 17:41.750
named Nelson Dubeck?

17:41.790 --> 17:43.678
He's with the Office
of Public Integrity.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.188
Anything you can find,
dirt or past arrests.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.857
Maybe he has a drinking problem.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.266
I am not a dirty stinking Jew!

17:53.770 --> 17:57.536
(piano playing
"Someone to Watch Over Me")

18:09.150 --> 18:10.617
ALICIA:
Is there any way...

18:10.650 --> 18:12.311
(sighs)
to delay the lease?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.658
Okay.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.328
N0, I'll...

18:17.360 --> 18:19.351
I'll figure something out.

18:21.630 --> 18:24.269
You can always
live with me.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.768
Oh. Thank you
so much, Jackie.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.837
But this is_ _
a good school district.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.634
You don't need to worry
about a good school district.

18:32.670 --> 18:33.830
CARY:
Hold on. Alicia's here.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.446
Okay, give
us a minute.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.449
That was Robyn. She has
an instinct on Rayna Hecht.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.742
How's the speech going?

18:42.780 --> 18:43.849
Mr. Hayden,
you got out of your taxi.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.846
Yes, I decided to walk.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.858
It was only 15 blocks.
CARY:
So,

18:47.890 --> 18:48.914
Robyn thinks

18:48.960 --> 18:50.109
Hecht isn't leaving
her firm because

18:50.160 --> 18:52.822
of the indictments. Or just
because of the indictments.

18:52.860 --> 18:56.751
VVhatthen?
The firm has ten senior partners
and Hecht was the only woman.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.927
A boys' club.
So she probably
wants a more

18:58.970 --> 19:00.369
woman-friendly firm.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.628
Okay.
So just...

19:01.670 --> 19:04.207
just play up the feminism angle
in your keynote.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.299
Frame your story as one
of female empowerment.

19:06.340 --> 19:10.572
Okay. Thanks.
I need to, um... write.

19:10.610 --> 19:11.645
And I've been talking up
the keynote.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.478
A lot of potential clients
are excited about it.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.613
Okay.

19:16.650 --> 19:17.912
Let's let the master at it.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.259
You'll be great.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.228
ALICIA:
Mr. Gardner.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.399
I just wanted to say...

19:29.430 --> 19:31.796
I'm a worthy lavwer
who needs a job.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.333
Women are underrepresented
in this business,

19:34.370 --> 19:35.792
and I shouldn't
be overlooked just...

19:42.980 --> 19:45.904
Hello, Will? It's Alicia.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.440
Do you have a minute?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.243
(laughs)

19:49.280 --> 19:51.248
No, really?

19:51.290 --> 19:52.917
You did not.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.885
I don't look anything
like those photos anymore.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.857
(laughs)
Well, um...

20:00.900 --> 20:04.996
you said I should call
ifI got a chance, so...

20:05.030 --> 20:07.362
this is me calling.

20:12.470 --> 20:15.598
JACKIE:
What are you
wearing that for?

20:16.710 --> 20:18.371
You weren't even here.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.571
Don't change the subject.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.941
It's business-like.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.244
You spent $300 on it.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.316
Well, that's what
a good dress costs.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.851
Your husband is wasting away
in prison

20:30.890 --> 20:34.428
and you're trying to seduce
your way into a job.

20:34.460 --> 20:38.021
Your son is the one
who put me here.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.992
I have two kids.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.362
What am I supposed to do?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.038
No.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.903
You like nice things.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.602
So go be a whore.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.403
(laughing):
I did-did do that.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.509
(both laughing)

20:53.550 --> 20:55.518
So...

20:55.550 --> 20:58.519
that covers me up to last June.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.313
Now about you?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.658
Oh, well...

21:02.690 --> 21:04.851
there's not much to say.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.859
I'm a mother, a wife

21:07.900 --> 21:10.289
and now a disgraced spouse.

21:10.330 --> 21:11.661
I'm sorry.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.759
No, no, no, no, that...
that wasn't self-pity,

21:13.800 --> 21:15.768
that was me trying
to make light of it.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.462
Oh. Uh...
I think I've lost my touch.

21:18.510 --> 21:19.932
(laughs) No, the
touch is still there.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.305
And now you have a new job?

21:22.340 --> 21:24.501
Unfortunately,
it was a paralegal job.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.506
Voluntary.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.472
You're kidding.
Yeah... no.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.489
I was, um, misinformed.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.886
Well...

21:33.920 --> 21:35.649
Have you thought about
working here?

21:56.610 --> 21:58.407
Is there an opening here?

21:58.450 --> 22:00.475
Well... we could.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.579
I haven't worked in 13 years.
Are you saying

22:02.620 --> 22:03.882
o l
y u re rusty?
No! '

22:03.920 --> 22:05.046
No.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.046
I'm good.
(laughs)

22:07.090 --> 22:08.614
You've always been good.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.620
Will, I... I'm...

22:19.670 --> 22:22.559
My connection with
my husband hurts me.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.068
Why are you trying
to dissuade me now?

22:26.670 --> 22:28.672
I don't know. (laughs)

22:28.710 --> 22:30.507
Because I'm making no sense.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.700
Hey.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.014
We've all got a past
that could hurt us.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.611
Don't let yours hurt you.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.551
(indistinct conversations)

22:50.600 --> 22:52.591
(piano playing gentle melody)

22:54.770 --> 22:56.795
(laughing)

22:56.840 --> 22:59.559
CARY:
You here for the job?

22:59.610 --> 23:02.101
I think I am.

23:02.140 --> 23:04.108
You?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.141
Yup.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.948
Cary.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.413
Excuse me.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.655
What did you think of me
when you first met me?

23:19.730 --> 23:21.618
Is this about your speech,
or more procrastinating?

23:21.660 --> 23:22.752
Speech.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.791
I liked you.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.127
You did not.

23:26.170 --> 23:27.569
Do you even remember
where it was?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.067
Yeah, in reception.

23:29.100 --> 23:30.431
Waiting for our interviews.

23:30.470 --> 23:31.767
I thought you
were gonna get it.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.732
And I wasn't.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.509
I thought you were
a cocky new associate.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.599
I was a cocky new associate.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.641
And I thought you were entitled.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.572
I was a little entitled.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.588
Poor. But entitled.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.918
Can you be both?
Oh, yeah. So...

23:46.950 --> 23:48.679
who would you hire

23:48.720 --> 23:51.848
if we had to hire someone today?

23:51.890 --> 23:53.824
You.

23:53.860 --> 23:55.748
Yeah, me, too.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.665
(laughs)
You're supposed to

23:57.700 --> 23:59.691
say me.
No, no.

23:59.730 --> 24:00.594
And you wouldn't
hire yourself, either.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.700
You're right.
I hate that about myself.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.002
No.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.905
It's smart.

24:06.940 --> 24:10.740
So why did
Will hire you?

24:10.780 --> 24:12.645
Because you're a slut.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.671
What?

24:16.880 --> 24:18.780
Nothing. I need to finish.

24:18.820 --> 24:21.550
Okay.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.751
Good luck.

24:25.530 --> 24:26.758
ELSBETH:
Thank you, Kalinda,

24:26.790 --> 24:28.690
that is great.

24:28.730 --> 24:31.096
Uh, good-bye,
Ka... uh, Kalinda.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.791
I don't know.

24:32.830 --> 24:33.694
Um...

24:33.740 --> 24:36.664
Yeah, I got... I got
to go, someone's here.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.804
Uh, hello?

24:38.840 --> 24:40.774
Elsbeth Tascioni.
How are you?

24:42.210 --> 24:44.678
I'm good. Do I know you?
Oh, no.

24:44.710 --> 24:47.770
But you're Nelson Dubeck from
the Office of Public Integrity.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.913
You helped prosecute
Rod Blagojevich.

24:49.950 --> 24:51.611
I did. Do you need something?

24:51.650 --> 24:55.154
Yeah, I need you
to leave Will Gardner alone

24:55.190 --> 24:56.953
or I'll sue you for harassment.

24:56.990 --> 24:59.584
(chuckles)

24:59.630 --> 25:02.895
Mr. Gardner should consider
how seriously I take this.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.522
Take what?

25:04.570 --> 25:08.165
He acquired a videotape
of a stuffed ballot box.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.067
He brought that videotape
to the governor-elect.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.702
And he attempted
to show it to him.

25:12.740 --> 25:13.832
What videotape?

25:17.080 --> 25:18.672
What is that?

25:18.710 --> 25:21.270
That is a videotape
of three men taking a ballot box

25:21.320 --> 25:23.311
into a polling place.
No, it looks like a...

25:23.350 --> 25:26.080
GIF. Or is a "jif"?

25:26.120 --> 25:29.988
GIF.
Have you ever seen the
GIF of that bear, uh,

25:30.020 --> 25:32.181
falling onto a trampoline
and then bouncing

25:32.230 --> 25:34.926
into a pool? It
is so funny, but

25:34.960 --> 25:36.757
I was surprised to find out

25:36.800 --> 25:39.667
that the pool was... faked.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.167
All digitally futzed with.
If you're suggesting

25:41.200 --> 25:42.758
that this videotape
was in any way manipulated...

25:42.800 --> 25:44.768
Oh, eight bits per
pixel makes a GIF

25:44.810 --> 25:48.200
highly manipulatable... ble.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.776
I hope you have
the original,

25:49.810 --> 25:51.641
because otherwise
I'm gonna object

25:51.680 --> 25:54.808
to the jif being
admitted into court.

25:54.850 --> 25:56.169
The governor's guilty.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.017
How do you know that?

25:58.050 --> 26:00.814
He's the governor of Illinois.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.781
(laughs): And...

26:01.820 --> 26:03.822
you think they're all corrupt?
No, they just

26:03.860 --> 26:05.020
happen to be all corrupt.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.221
So it doesn't matter
what the facts are,

26:07.260 --> 26:09.353
you'll prosecute Peter
Florrick for the crime

26:09.400 --> 26:10.765
of voter fraud?
Peter Florrick

26:10.800 --> 26:13.121
spent six months in prison.
He's a criminal.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.967
Who was exonerated.
No, his case

26:15.000 --> 26:15.830
was dismissed.
So you're out

26:15.870 --> 26:17.804
to get him.
I'm out to get a criminal.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.034
Even if there's no proof?

26:19.070 --> 26:20.970
I'll find the proof.

26:22.210 --> 26:25.805
This is Elsbeth Tascioni
recording Nelson Dubeck

26:25.850 --> 26:27.249
in the lobby

26:27.280 --> 26:29.339
of the Harrington Plaza at...

26:29.380 --> 26:31.041
11:33 pm.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.887
I'd erase that, ma'am.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.150
You did not have my permission
to make that recording,

26:35.190 --> 26:37.727
and without that permission
you are subject to prosecution.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.978
Oh, no, not in New York.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.827
Two-party consent
is the law

26:41.860 --> 26:43.828
in Illinois, but
this is New York.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.668
One-party consent
is enough here

26:46.700 --> 26:48.167
and I am one party.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.191
And I give my consent.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.764
(phone clicks off)

26:51.810 --> 26:54.904
I suggest you leave
Mr. Gardner alone, sir.

26:54.940 --> 26:56.407
He's a nice man.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.078
He has no part in your vendetta

26:58.110 --> 27:00.908
against Governor Florrick.

27:02.350 --> 27:03.749
Oh.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.939
By the way,

27:04.990 --> 27:07.185
you should look
into an anti-Semitic

27:07.220 --> 27:10.348
costumed furry bear
in Times Square.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.802
Very few lawyers
can reach their prime

27:23.840 --> 27:26.707
after a decade _
as a mother in suburbia,

27:26.740 --> 27:28.332
but Alicia Florrick is...

27:28.380 --> 27:29.677
special.

27:29.710 --> 27:32.008
Row four, far left.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.711
ALICIA:
Great.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.968
Remember, say it loud
and with a smile.

27:36.020 --> 27:38.079
People will believe
whatever you tell them.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.111
Oh, and, uh,
Rayna Hecht is here.

27:40.150 --> 27:42.880
It would help our cause
if you could dazzle her.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.729
MODERATOR:
...Alicia Florrick.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.796
DUBECK:
The governor's guilty.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.058
ELSBETH:
How do you know that?

27:53.100 --> 27:54.795
DUBECK:
He's the governor of Illinois.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.239
You got him to say that?

27:56.270 --> 27:57.737
I didn't get him
to say anything.

27:57.770 --> 27:59.704
He wanted to say it.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.799
If he comes after
you, we'll use it.
But he's not coming after me.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.400
I don't think so.
Not with what he has.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.769
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.176
No, no, no. (chuckles)

28:08.220 --> 28:11.144
I'm just, um...

28:11.190 --> 28:12.748
Got to go.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.212
ALICIA:
And then a firm finally agreed
to meet with me.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.751
I prepared by looking
in a mirror.

28:16.790 --> 28:18.257
(crowd gently laughs)

28:18.290 --> 28:20.929
It was the only interview
I could still get.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.120
(laughter)

28:22.160 --> 28:24.390
When you're sitting
across the desk

28:24.430 --> 28:27.763
from someone
who can hire you,

28:27.800 --> 28:31.463
you feel every one
of those 13 years.

28:32.840 --> 28:36.776
But, luckily, I had
a very good interviewer.

28:36.810 --> 28:40.041
He asked me_ if
I was up to it,

28:40.080 --> 28:42.776
coming back to
the workplace.

28:42.820 --> 28:45.288
The interviewer
pointed out that I was

28:45.320 --> 28:48.153
arguing
against myself.

28:48.190 --> 28:50.511
I should stop...

28:50.560 --> 28:53.825
pointing out reasons
why I shouldn't be hired.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.521
(soft laughter)

28:55.560 --> 28:58.097
What did I learn from this?

28:58.130 --> 29:00.166
Use everything you have

29:00.200 --> 29:01.531
to get the job.

29:01.570 --> 29:03.834
And don't
feel entitled.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.532
Will Gardner.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.878
WILL:
Just hear me out.

29:10.910 --> 29:12.241
DIANE:
The hiring committee has voted.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.542
WILL:
Yeah, but we shouldn't

29:13.580 --> 29:14.911
penalize her.

29:14.950 --> 29:17.043
Her face is on
the news 24-7.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.116
Every political blog
is writing about her.

29:19.150 --> 29:22.358
Wait, she wasn't the one
who slept with the hookers.

29:22.390 --> 29:24.529
Were you involved
with this woman?

29:24.560 --> 29:27.484
What?
You never push for
associate hires.

29:27.530 --> 29:30.192
She was my friend.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.460
And... the smartest person
in our class.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.298
Give me something I can
sell to the other partners.

29:38.340 --> 29:39.807
WILL: _
There's a lavwer I'm trying

29:39.840 --> 29:41.831
to bring on board, but
I'm getting some push back.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.472
I need you to put
a dossier together on her.

29:43.510 --> 29:45.478
Okay. Who is she?

29:45.510 --> 29:46.579
Alicia Florrick.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.942
Peter Florrick's wife?

29:48.980 --> 29:50.072
Yeah. Why?

29:50.120 --> 29:52.088
Nothing.

29:52.120 --> 29:54.088
(applause)

29:54.120 --> 29:58.124
ALICIA:
Of course, the advantage of
being a woman opting back in

29:58.160 --> 29:59.457
is that no_one
ever questioned

29:59.490 --> 30:01.424
why you opted out
in the first place.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.996
(crowd laughs softly)

30:03.030 --> 30:04.861
Women are cut
little slack on this.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.391
Men, even less.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.864
KALINDA:
I looked into Alicia Florrick.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.209
I spoke to her old firm.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.003
She managed to win
a couple dozen cases

30:14.040 --> 30:16.577
before taking
her maternity leave.

30:16.610 --> 30:18.908
Even managed to bring in
some small clients.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.076
But?

30:20.110 --> 30:21.873
They were
about to fire her.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.046
They thought
she wasn't tough enough.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.843
She never knew,
but they said

30:24.890 --> 30:26.846
shelacked
a killer instinct.

30:26.890 --> 30:29.950
What do you want me
to do with this?

30:31.360 --> 30:32.452
Bury it.

30:32.490 --> 30:33.320
ALICIA:
The one upside

30:33.360 --> 30:36.397
to a scandal or a
tragedy in your life

30:36.430 --> 30:39.627
is that it is the best
kind of wake-up call.

30:39.670 --> 30:43.595
Would I have done it
any differently if I were a man?

30:43.640 --> 30:45.369
Would I have...

30:45.410 --> 30:47.162
Uh, would I have done...

30:47.210 --> 30:50.373
I mean, uh...

30:50.410 --> 30:53.971
Uh, would I have felt
differently if I were a man?

30:55.350 --> 30:56.977
CARY (whispers):
What's going on?

30:57.020 --> 30:58.612
Lindler just launched
a hostile takeover

30:58.650 --> 31:00.186
of MRG Pharmaceuticals.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.619
Everybody wants
to get in on it.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.548
Excuse me.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.581
The answer is I would
never do it differently.

31:07.230 --> 31:10.927
The key is to raise
your profile.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.495
Opt-out moms are held
to a higher standard

31:13.530 --> 31:15.634
than anyone else.

31:15.670 --> 31:19.367
We... have to work harder.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.901
We have to make up
for lost time.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.875
*

31:35.020 --> 31:37.386
Uh, is there any other...?

31:47.170 --> 31:48.967
I'm almost finished.
I won't bother you.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.438
Scotch, no ice.

31:52.470 --> 31:53.903
They only have beer.

31:54.740 --> 31:56.708
Been

31:56.740 --> 31:58.947
*

32:12.630 --> 32:15.098
*

32:15.130 --> 32:16.722
It's hard
to get drunk on beer.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.320
Mm, you just got
to try harder.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.338
WOMAN:
Yeah, yeah.

32:21.370 --> 32:25.101
She doesn't like me,
and I don't give a flying crap.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.005
(laughing):
Flying crap.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.507
Go to hell.
Is that better?

32:28.540 --> 32:30.508
You're in a bad mood.

32:30.540 --> 32:34.169
I just had 300 people
walk out on me.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.176
It looked like 400.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.211
*

32:40.450 --> 32:42.259
Why do you hate me?

32:42.290 --> 32:44.656
Hmm.

32:44.690 --> 32:47.625
Well, I don't like you.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.254
Hate's probably
too strong.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.222
Why?

32:52.270 --> 32:53.726
Are you serious?

32:53.770 --> 32:55.590
Because of that?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.528
Three weeks. Three_ weeks
you were scheming.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.128
That wasn't my fault.

32:59.170 --> 33:01.001
I wanted to leave
right away.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.598
With our clients.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.438
Wow. It just never ends.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.386
Don't ask the question if
you don't want the answer.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.421
What?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.391
We could never make it work.

33:29.670 --> 33:32.559
You're linking two things
together I never did.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.399
(bangs loudly)

33:38.450 --> 33:40.145
Thanks a lot.

33:40.180 --> 33:42.216
You want to say
"bitch," say "bitch."

33:42.250 --> 33:44.411
Bitch.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.213
So,

33:46.250 --> 33:49.458
you're saying that if I were
any other partner leaving,

33:49.490 --> 33:51.685
you would hate me
the way you do?

33:51.730 --> 33:53.618
I'm saying,
if you were any other partner,

33:53.660 --> 33:56.299
I'd be as unhappy
and competitive as I am now.

33:56.330 --> 33:58.469
I don't believe you.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.320
That's your right.

34:00.370 --> 34:02.338
You're enjoying
your pain too much.

34:02.370 --> 34:03.792
Yup.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.808
*

34:05.840 --> 34:08.434
So, you're gonna fight me
on every client, every case?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.368
I will be your competitor.

34:10.410 --> 34:12.344
You're up for it.

34:12.380 --> 34:13.847
You're a big girl.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.075
Okay.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.848
I guess it's something.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.518
Mm. It's something.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.551
*

34:40.440 --> 34:42.670
(ringtone plays)

34:42.710 --> 34:44.371
Yes.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.844
CARY:
Where are you? Can you talk?

34:46.880 --> 34:50.441
I'm in the coffee shop
across the street.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.380
And no.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.512
Someone's sitting near you?

34:53.550 --> 34:55.518
Yes.
(Cary sighs)

34:55.560 --> 34:57.516
Rayna Hecht was impressed
with your speech.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.152
She wants to meet.

34:59.190 --> 35:00.487
Uh... when?

35:00.530 --> 35:02.794
Now. She's leaving
early tomorrow.

35:02.830 --> 35:04.764
Now?

35:04.800 --> 35:07.268
I-I've had a few.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.268
Few?

35:09.300 --> 35:10.858
Nothing. Uh, where?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.903
In the lounge. She wants
to have a quick drink with us.

35:13.940 --> 35:16.101
Great.

35:18.580 --> 35:19.649
A meeting?

35:21.680 --> 35:25.138
A very important meeting.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.146
How to destroy our competitors.

35:27.190 --> 35:29.408
Good. I expect no less.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.757
May the best man win.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.451
*

35:38.530 --> 35:40.498
(loud crowd chatter)

35:40.530 --> 35:41.895
Mr. Gardner?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.498
Yes?

35:43.540 --> 35:45.303
We've never met.
Jim Moody.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.501
I used to work...
I know who you are.

35:47.540 --> 35:50.577
I need five minutes
of your time.

35:50.610 --> 35:52.601
No.

35:53.450 --> 35:55.315
Please.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.381
Look, this guy
from Justice, Dubeck--

35:58.420 --> 36:00.183
he's turning the screws on me.

36:00.220 --> 36:01.289
Listen to me.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.811
You and I are_both witnesses
in a grand jury hearing.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.521
Legally, we cannot talk
to each other.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.290
I just want to make sure you and
I are telling the same story.

36:08.330 --> 36:09.354
Did you hear
what I just said?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.868
I only did what Eli Gold told me
to do that night.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.458
I don't care.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.230
You stay the hell away from me,
or I'll call security.

36:18.770 --> 36:21.603
Five minutes isn't much time, so
just keep it all bullet points.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.608
I'll talk about firm culture,
and Alicia...

36:23.640 --> 36:25.744
I will handle
women-friendly policies,

36:25.780 --> 36:27.441
and crapital structure.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.448
Our what?
Capital structure.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.777
You said "crapital."

36:30.820 --> 36:32.617
No, I didn't.
Mrs. Florrick,

36:32.650 --> 36:34.459
are you inebriated?

36:34.490 --> 36:36.981
I'll be fine.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.351
Oh, dear God.

36:38.390 --> 36:40.358
Okay, all right.
Well, let-let us just talk,

36:40.390 --> 36:41.891
and then, you just go ahead...

36:41.930 --> 36:45.320
Hello. Oh, don't get up.
Don't get up. Please.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.997
I'm so sorry for blowing
you off earlier.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.339
And don't say I
didn't, because I did.

36:49.370 --> 36:52.635
Ah, Mrs. Florrick. Hello.

36:52.670 --> 36:53.432
Hello.

36:53.470 --> 36:54.801
Powerful speech.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.673
And I'm sorry so many of
our colleagues had to miss it.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.849
Thank you.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.973
So we wanted to talk
about our firm. We're just

37:03.020 --> 37:04.612
getting started, but we
read your article...

37:04.650 --> 37:05.844
I'll be honest.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.539
I like you guys. I do.

37:07.590 --> 37:10.411
And I do intend to decide
within the next 48 hours.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.883
_ And I'm interested
in your firm because you

37:12.930 --> 37:14.249
have female partners.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.597
CLARKE:
Yes, we try not
to discriminate,

37:15.630 --> 37:17.427
in promotion at all.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.428
Good.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.633
Were you unhappy
at Lockhart/Gardner?

37:22.670 --> 37:26.902
Oh, I... um, I was happy
up to a point.

37:26.940 --> 37:30.307
They... uh, let me grow.

37:30.340 --> 37:32.547
They let me...

37:34.920 --> 37:36.876
...learn.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.549
And then, I had to put
what I learned on its feet.

37:40.590 --> 37:43.013
CARY:
And that's what we're doing
at Florrick-Agos, so,

37:43.060 --> 37:44.379
Clarke, why don't you just...

37:44.430 --> 37:46.057
you go ahead and talk
about the, um...

37:46.090 --> 37:47.728
Yes, our, uh,
crapital structure.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.455
(sighs)

37:49.500 --> 37:51.525
Capital. Capital structure.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.562
What do you want, Alicia?

37:57.500 --> 37:59.468
What do I want?

37:59.510 --> 38:02.502
Yes. What do you want?

38:05.910 --> 38:07.878
I want a happy life,

38:07.910 --> 38:10.811
and I want to control my fate.

38:11.850 --> 38:14.489
Hmm.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.488
Thank you, gentlemen.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.727
Alicia.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.728
Good talking to you.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.068
Was that a good thing?

38:28.100 --> 38:30.534
How were you supposed to answer?

38:30.570 --> 38:31.901
Oh.

38:36.680 --> 38:40.400
(singing off-key):
* Just what makes
that little old ant *

38:40.450 --> 38:43.613
* Think he'll move
that rubber tree plant *

38:43.650 --> 38:47.086
* Anyone knows an ant can't

38:47.120 --> 38:50.658
* Move a rubber tree plant
'cause he's got *

38:50.690 --> 38:52.578
* High hopes

38:52.630 --> 38:55.497
* He's got high hopes

38:55.530 --> 38:56.497
* He's got...

38:56.530 --> 38:59.795
Ms. Tascioni,
don't take this the wrong way,

38:59.830 --> 39:02.560
but you have an awful voice.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.636
(laughs)
I know.

39:04.670 --> 39:08.401
I know, but this city--
it inspires me.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.034
Really? I find
it makes me sweat.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.413
(laughs)
I'm gonna treat us
to some more little drinks.

39:14.450 --> 39:16.145
I'm old-fashioned, Ms. Tascioni.
I'll treat.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.670
No, no, no.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.688
I'm having a good day.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.451
I just landed
a new partnerI met.

39:23.490 --> 39:25.424
We're starting
a two-woman firm.

39:25.460 --> 39:28.156
My I ask your partner's name?

39:28.190 --> 39:29.851
Rayna Hecht.

39:29.900 --> 39:30.889
(phone buzzing)

39:30.930 --> 39:33.091
Oh, excuse me. Buzzy, buzz.

39:33.130 --> 39:35.030
(buzzing continues)

39:35.070 --> 39:37.459
Oh. (gasps)

39:37.500 --> 39:39.502
I got to go. I'm sorry.

39:42.610 --> 39:45.579
(plays discordant keys)

39:45.610 --> 39:47.100
Please excuse
the cramped quarters.

39:47.150 --> 39:48.617
What's going on?

39:48.650 --> 39:50.641
From the start, Wayne.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.566
That is you

40:05.600 --> 40:08.569
and Jimmy Moody conversing
in private, Mr. Gardner.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.568
Look, there was no conversing.
I told him

40:10.600 --> 40:11.635
to stay away.
Will.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.467
Well, to a grand jury,

40:13.510 --> 40:16.638
it's going to look like
two witnesses conspiring to

40:16.680 --> 40:17.738
cover up election fraud.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.044
That's ten years
in federal prison.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.741
(laughs)
You can't be serious.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.771
The best part, Ms. Tascioni, is

40:23.820 --> 40:25.947
this is the original
surveillance video.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.982
The chain of custody is perfect
and unimpeachable in court.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.749
You cut a deal with Moody?

40:30.790 --> 40:33.224
Mr. Gardner, you still have
to see the forest

40:33.260 --> 40:34.591
through the trees.

40:34.630 --> 40:35.824
I'm not interested in you.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.725
I want Peter Florrick.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.126
All you have to do
is testify against him.

40:41.170 --> 40:42.694
We'll think about it.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.935
You have 48 hours.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.705
My plane lands at 9:00 am.

40:49.740 --> 40:51.605
I'll see you at home?

40:51.650 --> 40:53.868
Love you.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.117
Hi, Ms. Florrick.

40:56.150 --> 40:57.913
Lorainne Joy
from Clements & Holloway.

40:57.950 --> 40:59.611
You came in for an interview

40:59.650 --> 41:01.186
a few years ago?

41:01.220 --> 41:03.859
Of course. Ms. Joy. Hello.

41:03.890 --> 41:05.721
Lorraine, please.

41:05.760 --> 41:07.682
I head your speech last night.

41:07.730 --> 41:09.049
It was terrific.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.658
Thank you.
Listen,

41:10.700 --> 41:13.260
I know you've got
your own shop now,

41:13.300 --> 41:16.963
but we were wondering
if you could come in for a chat,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.867
see if we could convince you
to maybe come work for us?

41:19.910 --> 41:22.037
Oh, thank you,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.036
but I'm happy where I am.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.968
Okay.

41:26.010 --> 41:28.717
Well, maybe down the road.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.811
(laughs softly)

41:36.790 --> 41:38.758
WILL:
You're hired.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.758
I...

41:40.790 --> 41:42.758
What?

41:42.800 --> 41:44.927
First year associate.
You start on Monday.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.221
(laughs)

41:46.270 --> 41:48.534
My God, I thought
you were going to say,

41:48.570 --> 41:50.595
"Sorry, the position is filled."

41:50.640 --> 41:52.164
Nope. You're stuck with us.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.632
Now you have to impress us.

41:53.670 --> 41:55.706
I can do that.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.708
Will, thank you.

41:57.740 --> 41:59.708
I-I know you didn't have to.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.776
Alicia, when I'm broke
and lying in an alley somewhere,

42:02.820 --> 42:04.583
do something nice for me.

42:05.620 --> 42:08.282
Okay. Promise.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.959
Good. Now start reading up
on contract law.

42:10.990 --> 42:13.049
On my way.
