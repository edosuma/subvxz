They dumped something. . .

03:00.973 --> 03:03.203

03:03.373 --> 03:09.528
There was a radio run last night. Possible

What is this, a dog run here?

03:19.413 --> 03:22.052
You can hope it was a dog.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.722
l haven't even had my coffee yet.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.891
You Bet Your Life

04:42.853 --> 04:44.366
WOMAN:
Hey, baby.

Hey.

04:48.813 --> 04:51.373

You see guys bothering a girl last night?

04:54.573 --> 04:58.248

But it might've been.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.485

Two guys pulled up in like a 4x4. . .

05:28.733 --> 05:32.089
. . .a beat-up black one.
A guy in front and a guy in back.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.848
They said a few words to
a Spanish girl, and she was gonna get in.

05:36.293 --> 05:38.249
Then she was backing out
of the deal.

05:38.453 --> 05:39.966
The guy got a hold on her. . .

05:40.133 --> 05:41.930
-. . .and he pulled her in.
-She pregnant?

05:42.133 --> 05:44.931
-Yeah, you find her?
-We found a body.

05:45.093 --> 05:47.004
FATSO:
Oh, hell.

05:47.333 --> 05:51.212
l'm like the neighborhood watch

05:51.413 --> 05:55.008

number on their license plate.

05:56.453 --> 05:59.172
-Good for you.
-Take it easy, Fats.

06:04.173 --> 06:06.607
-Yes?
-Well, hello.

06:07.453 --> 06:09.284
And what might your name be?

06:09.453 --> 06:10.806
Did you wanna see someone?

06:11.013 --> 06:13.891
There was a pawnshop robbed
on Fifth Street yesterday.

06:14.053 --> 06:16.123

06:45.893 --> 06:47.690

-Yeah, right.

06:47.933 --> 06:51.369

-Last l heard, there was no reward.

07:11.173 --> 07:12.652
No reward?

07:12.813 --> 07:15.646
Well, what are you gonna do?

07:17.293 --> 07:20.251
We might drum up a few dollars
for the right information.

07:20.533 --> 07:21.807
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

07:22.013 --> 07:24.971
l could, if there's something
in it for me, l could come. . .

07:25.133 --> 07:28.011
. . .across something, find something out.

07:28.933 --> 07:30.651
What are they talking about for that?

07:30.813 --> 07:35.045
l don't know. Maybe, if your information
panned out, a couple hundred dollars.

07:35.813 --> 07:38.964
l heard they got over $20,000.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.643
-That's what l heard.
-What've you got on this?

07:41.853 --> 07:44.492
l'm not sure. You know,
let me think about it.

07:44.653 --> 07:47.042
All right? That's all.

07:49.293 --> 07:52.649
-Two hundred? Two hundred dollars?
-Yeah.

07:54.013 --> 07:57.130
l wasn't in no accident.
Somebody says l was, they're lying.

07:57.333 --> 08:01.121
-Take it easy, Rudy. l got the boss.
-Yeah. Come on.

08:01.973 --> 08:04.931
-What's doing, lieu?
-Where are we on the burnt body?

08:05.093 --> 08:09.006
No way to make an lD. We knew it was
a woman because she was pregnant.

08:09.173 --> 08:12.609
Notify Missing Persons. Maybe you
can get something off dental records.

08:12.773 --> 08:15.924
This guy we brought in, his Jeep
was called in last night. . .

08:16.093 --> 08:19.085
. . .involved in an abduction
a couple blocks away from the body.

08:19.293 --> 08:21.932
-We'll see if there's anything there.
-Okay.

08:25.613 --> 08:27.649
We're not talking about
an accident, Rudy.

08:27.813 --> 08:31.522
-You said my car was in an accident.
-We think your car was used in a crime.

08:31.693 --> 08:33.808
-Maybe a murder.
-You got the wrong car.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.804
No, we got the right car.

08:35.972 --> 08:39.010
A witness took your license number
at the abduction scene.

08:39.212 --> 08:42.568
-Black Jeep. Corner of First and 1 0th.
-My stomach's killing me.

08:42.732 --> 08:45.008
-l got stomach problems.
SlMONE: You got more than that.

08:45.453 --> 08:48.763
-l didn't use the car last night.
-Who had it?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.451
l loaned it to my cousin
and his buddy.

08:54.613 --> 09:00.449
You better give up some names
and addresses, or this is falling on you.

09:03.373 --> 09:06.445
Sal Molina, he's my cousin.
And Bobby. . .

09:07.173 --> 09:09.971
. . .Ruiz. They wouldn't do that.
They went to see somebody.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.567
We need where Sal and Bobby live.

09:12.733 --> 09:15.201
RUD Y:
l can give you where they hang.

09:15.653 --> 09:19.168
-This better be straight here, Rudy.
-Straight.

09:25.853 --> 09:28.413
-Am l done?
-No, you're gonna stick around.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.652
-My stomach's killing me.
-Well, we'll send you in some Tums.

09:42.413 --> 09:45.405
Oh, my God, Dan. Did you get mugged?

09:45.613 --> 09:47.333
You have a minute to talk?

09:48.173 --> 09:50.607
Take your time, Andy.
l got calls to make.

09:50.813 --> 09:53.691
-What the hell happened?
-We'll get to that. How are you doing?

09:53.893 --> 09:55.451
-l'm all right, Dan.
-Gotten another sponsor?

09:55.573 --> 09:56.562
No.

09:56.893 --> 10:00.283
-Have you gone back out?
-Let's talk about me another time.

10:00.453 --> 10:02.762
l wanna know how you got beat up.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.127
Well, you. . .

10:04.293 --> 10:07.365
. . .you met my son, Danny,
didn't you? About four months ago.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.292
Yeah, l saw him once over at your place.

10:10.453 --> 10:12.250
He didn't do this to you, did he?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.573
l didn't want to tell you about Danny.

10:15.733 --> 10:18.247
l felt kind of private about it.

10:18.413 --> 10:21.803
Danny's been in and out of institutions
the last nine or 1 0 years.

10:21.973 --> 10:25.045
They say it's a chemical thing
in his mind.

10:25.853 --> 10:29.402
He was released again a few weeks
ago, and he's been staying with me.

10:30.133 --> 10:32.010
What set him off?

10:32.733 --> 10:35.167
lf he takes the medication,
he's all right.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.812
He won't take it.

10:37.013 --> 10:41.052
Something gets into him,
and he just won't take it.

10:42.293 --> 10:45.171
Then God knows what it's like
inside his head.

10:45.333 --> 10:49.167
l'm just talking to him and l ask
him to turn down the television. . . .

10:49.813 --> 10:51.087
And he beat you up.

10:51.253 --> 10:54.484
He hasn't been back since
this happened yesterday.

10:55.373 --> 10:58.445
He's gone back
to Tompkins Square Park.

10:58.973 --> 11:03.603
He's got this area he's kind of settled in,
down in the southwest end.

11:03.773 --> 11:06.207
He walks all day long.

11:06.573 --> 11:10.452
l want to go pick him up, Dan.
l don't want him doing this to you again.

11:12.613 --> 11:15.332
l guess l just can't think
like a father here.

11:16.013 --> 11:18.846
He might hurt somebody else.

11:25.093 --> 11:27.732
He wears a Walkman
in his ears all the time.

11:28.013 --> 11:30.163
Don't open the door till
you hear from me.

11:30.413 --> 11:32.290
Anybody knocks,
don't let them in.

11:32.773 --> 11:33.893
-l'll talk about you at a subsequent point.
-Yeah, okay, Dan.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.566
-l'll talk about you at a subsequent point.
-Yeah, okay, Dan.

11:47.493 --> 11:49.085
What happened to that guy?

11:49.253 --> 11:52.484
You got a minute to help before
l get those guys with the Jeep?

11:52.773 --> 11:54.172
Absolutely.

11:55.253 --> 11:57.084
-James, you got a minute?
-Sure, Andy.

11:57.253 --> 11:58.766
SlPOWlCZ:
Grab your coat.

12:22.733 --> 12:26.203
Hang back a little, let me see
if l can get him to come easy.

12:28.693 --> 12:30.411
Danny!

12:30.693 --> 12:32.092
Danny!

12:32.613 --> 12:34.683
Hey, Danny.

12:35.253 --> 12:38.131
-l don't know you.
-My name's Andy.

12:38.893 --> 12:41.487
l'm a friend of your dad's.

12:43.173 --> 12:44.208
That's all right.

12:44.373 --> 12:48.446
Why don't you take the headphones off?
Turn down the music a minute, all right?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.005
All right.

12:51.293 --> 12:55.047
-You had it up loud, right?
-That way l don't have to listen.

12:55.933 --> 12:58.970
-You have to go someplace with me.
-Why?

12:59.173 --> 13:01.892
Rules and regulations.
l gotta talk to you.

13:02.173 --> 13:04.971
-l eat by myself.
-We'll go over and have a bowl--

13:05.893 --> 13:09.681
You killed that baby, didn't you?
You shouldn't have killed the baby!

13:09.893 --> 13:12.851
Settle down here. Now we're gonna go
to the station house--

13:12.973 --> 13:14.645
SlMONE:
Hey!

13:17.813 --> 13:20.407

SlPOWlCZ: Hey, Danny, take it easy.

13:20.573 --> 13:22.325
DANNY: Help, l'm being killed.

SlPOWlCZ: We're trying to help you.
-Stop trying to kill me, you bastards.

13:35.933 --> 13:38.845
SlPOWlCZ: Nobody's trying to kill you.
-Murderers! Murderers! Murderers!

13:39.013 --> 13:41.129
-Bastard murderers!
SlPOWlCZ: We're trying to help.

13:42.253 --> 13:43.606
Danny! Danny!

13:44.053 --> 13:48.604
DANNY: Dad! Dad, help me!
Dad, help me!

13:49.533 --> 13:51.091
SlMONE: Cuff him, James.
-He bites.

13:51.293 --> 13:54.205
Dad! Dad!

13:56.133 --> 13:59.569
SlMONE: Relax. You got him cuffed?
MARTlNEZ: Yeah, l got him.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.489
Okay, let's go.

14:03.453 --> 14:05.648
Take it easy, Danny. Settle down.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.924
DANNY:
Dad, help me!

14:09.093 --> 14:11.129
SlPOWlCZ: Take it easy!
-Dad, help me.

14:11.293 --> 14:12.692
Take it easy.

14:13.653 --> 14:18.169
-Should we take him back to the house?
-Let's just take him straight to Bellevue.

14:25.693 --> 14:28.048
SlPOWlCZ:
We'll discuss what it's about up here.

14:28.213 --> 14:30.522
lf this is about parking violations,
they got paid.

14:30.733 --> 14:32.689
SlPOWlCZ:
You'll find out what it's about.

14:32.853 --> 14:34.923
-We didn't do nothing, right, Bobby?
BOBBY: Right.

14:35.093 --> 14:37.288
SAL: We tight and we right.
-Be quiet.

14:37.453 --> 14:41.048
-Known him since we were kids.
-So you've talked a long time. Shut up.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.852
-Just cut this nonsense out.
SlMONE: Thanks, James.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.492
No problem.

14:51.253 --> 14:53.926
Hey, you're not at home.

14:56.653 --> 14:59.929
So, what's up with that ring
in your face, Sal?

15:00.693 --> 15:04.766
-lt's just jewelry.
-Nice touch, man. Sit down.

15:11.413 --> 15:16.248
So, what were you and Bobby doing last
night after you borrowed Rudy's 4x4?

15:17.253 --> 15:19.289
That's what this is all about?

15:19.453 --> 15:22.411
We brought the damn car back.
How come Rudy turned us in?

15:22.573 --> 15:24.165
He just told us you had it.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.732
You got turned in. . .

15:25.893 --> 15:30.045
. . .by some guy that told us he saw
you drag a woman into that car.

15:30.253 --> 15:31.652
Wait, wait. A woman?

15:31.893 --> 15:33.849
-We didn't pull no woman.
-A hooker.

15:34.053 --> 15:35.611
A hooker?

15:35.773 --> 15:39.209
-Hey, l don't want no hookers.
-Sal, l'm not a vice cop.

15:39.373 --> 15:44.003
l don't care how you have fun.
l don't care if you were balling a hooker.

15:44.213 --> 15:48.525
Do l look like a guy that pays for it?
Come on, man. Check this face out.

15:48.733 --> 15:52.772
-l can get all the tail l can handle.
-Even some movie stars pay for it.

15:53.293 --> 15:55.887
-Well, l ain't no movie star.
-Well, maybe someday.

15:56.093 --> 16:00.006
-Hey, why not? l'll take it.
-Okay. So you didn't pick up a hooker.

16:00.773 --> 16:02.570
But our witness says that you did.

16:02.773 --> 16:05.367
He wrote the license plate number
of the 4x4.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.683
So think about this, Sal:

16:07.853 --> 16:10.811
A dead woman's body
was burned up last night.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.850
ln a vacant lot.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.481
lf you did pick up a hooker
and you're lying. . .

16:15.653 --> 16:19.646
. . .l figure maybe she's the dead woman.
Otherwise, why are you lying?

16:19.813 --> 16:21.413
See what l mean?
You must be covering something up.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.482
See what l mean?
You must be covering something up.

16:22.653 --> 16:25.008
But if you admit that you got a hooker. . .

16:25.173 --> 16:29.451
. . .so what? l just figure it's a couple
of guys out there screwing around.

16:29.813 --> 16:31.644
Man, your brain's working overtime.

16:31.813 --> 16:32.962
l told you. . .

16:33.133 --> 16:35.408
-. . .we didn't pick up a hooker.
-What did you do?

16:35.613 --> 16:37.604
-Just drove around looking.
-For what?

16:38.213 --> 16:41.444
-Just looking.
-Which one of you guys was driving?

16:42.693 --> 16:44.012
-Me.
-Seems to me. . .

16:44.173 --> 16:47.563
-. . .you grabbed her to rob her.
-Hey, we didn't rob no hooker.

16:47.813 --> 16:50.247
You know, maybe you
ought to get a hooker, man.

16:50.493 --> 16:53.803
-That's all you think about.
-Why? You think l have to pay for it?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.412
Could be.

16:55.573 --> 16:57.564
You sit still, Sal.

16:59.173 --> 17:02.051
Maybe we got a hooker,
but we did our thing and let her out.

17:02.213 --> 17:04.727
You picked her up at First and 1 0th?

17:04.893 --> 17:06.087
Yeah, could've been there.

17:06.292 --> 17:10.366
What does that mean? ls that where it
was? You pick her up at First and 1 0th?

17:10.532 --> 17:11.761
Yeah, l think that was it.

17:11.973 --> 17:14.248
-And who was driving?
-l was driving.

17:14.413 --> 17:17.644
First Rudy drove us to this guy
that Sal wanted to borrow money from.

17:17.853 --> 17:20.208
He wasn't home. Then
Rudy drove home and l drove.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.568
SlPOWlCZ: Why'd Rudy go home?
BOBBY: He just wanted to go home.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.689
SlPOWlCZ: Before you
picked up the hooker?

17:24.853 --> 17:25.968
Yeah.

17:28.252 --> 17:31.529
-You use drugs, Bobby?
-No, l got nothing to do with drugs.

17:31.693 --> 17:34.446
l take care of myself.
l'm going back to school.

17:34.613 --> 17:37.207
-Those are fine ideals.
-l want to better myself.

17:37.373 --> 17:38.488
Sure.

17:38.693 --> 17:43.972
After you got done bettering yourself,
banging that hooker, what'd you do?

17:44.173 --> 17:47.563
l let her out a couple blocks away.
We wanted to go to a club.

17:47.773 --> 17:50.128
Do some dancing, buy drinks.
Just have some fun.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.052
We drove around, but we were
broke, so we just drove around.

17:53.493 --> 17:57.372
You didn't wind up at the
Manhattan Bridge, did you, Bobby?

17:57.853 --> 17:58.888
No. Uh-uh.

18:00.733 --> 18:03.850
Okay, here's where you stand.

18:04.013 --> 18:07.926
The streetwalker who got in the Jeep,
our witness said she was dragged in.

18:08.133 --> 18:09.725
We figure that's a robbery.

18:09.893 --> 18:12.885
We know she was pregnant
and we know somebody dumped. . .

18:13.093 --> 18:16.972
. . .a pregnant woman's body under
that bridge last night and burned it up.

18:17.133 --> 18:20.489
-We got nothing to do with a robbery.
-Bobby. . .

18:20.653 --> 18:23.486
. . .we're gonna get dental x-rays
off that body.

18:23.653 --> 18:24.972
We'll identify her.

18:25.133 --> 18:31.163
We'll show her picture to the witness
who saw you, and that's gonna be it.

18:31.453 --> 18:36.846
You can do all the whining and explaining
you want, and l'll just laugh in your face.

18:38.533 --> 18:41.047
-l don't know about any dead woman.
-Talk to me now. . .

18:41.213 --> 18:46.412
. . .let me know you were only driving,
and maybe you do yourself some good.

18:49.813 --> 18:52.202
l don't know anything about it.

18:52.373 --> 18:55.046
Okay, get up.
You're going in the cage.

18:55.253 --> 18:57.289
l'm innocent.
Hey, come on, help me out.

18:57.493 --> 19:00.326
You're too dumb to help.
Come on. Get in.

19:09.253 --> 19:10.368
Any good?

19:10.533 --> 19:14.412
Do we trade Rudy a walk for admitting
these two guys went out to rob a whore?

19:14.693 --> 19:17.002
They're taking your guy out.
That Rudy Salinas.

19:17.173 --> 19:19.403
He's going to the hospital.
He's in pain.

19:19.573 --> 19:22.326
-What's going on?
-My stomach. l told you l got ulcers.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.967
We could straighten everything
out here for you--

19:25.173 --> 19:26.970
Oh, my God!

19:27.613 --> 19:29.524
l'll take a ride with him.

19:29.693 --> 19:32.412
-l'll check back with Missing Persons.
-Come on, guys.

19:32.773 --> 19:36.288
-Better not be in your mind, Rudy.
MAN: Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:40.253 --> 19:42.721
l wanna report an assault.
Martinez, assault.

19:42.893 --> 19:44.565
-Look at me.
DONNA: What happened?

19:44.733 --> 19:48.169
-You should see the other guy.
-Who hit you, Steve? Come on in.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.051
l know who robbed the pawnshop.

19:50.213 --> 19:51.885
-They post that reward yet?
MARTlNEZ: No.

19:52.053 --> 19:55.409
What a world. Screwed
everywhere you turn.

19:55.973 --> 19:58.043
-There'd be 200 in it?
-Tell me what you got.

19:58.213 --> 19:59.771
STEVE: All right. Here it is.
-Sit down.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.446
All right.

20:03.813 --> 20:06.691
l know who did the pawnshop.
You want his name, you got it.

20:06.853 --> 20:11.165
Slime like that should not be walking
around amongst decent people.

20:11.373 --> 20:13.091
Sit down.

20:14.093 --> 20:15.924
-What's his name?
-Weldon Small.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.727
He got out of Elmira a few weeks ago.
l knew him there.

20:19.213 --> 20:21.932
-Were you in on the pawnshop?
-No, l was not in on it.

20:22.093 --> 20:24.129
How do you know this guy did it?

20:24.293 --> 20:28.605
l planned the whole thing. That
pawnshop? l'm from that neighborhood.

20:28.773 --> 20:32.288
Guys wearing Groucho glasses?
You get those on and off in a second.

20:32.453 --> 20:36.605
Not like some dumb Halloween mask.
lt was all my concept. Me.

20:36.773 --> 20:40.732
See, l got out of the joint first, okay?

20:41.173 --> 20:45.689
And l come down sick. l got a little
pancreatitis. Didn't even know l had one.

20:45.853 --> 20:49.812
l'm in the hospital. Sick like a dog.
l'm recuperating, it's in the paper.

20:49.973 --> 20:53.807
Couldn't wait. And then this, right?
l find out where he's at. l go over.

20:54.093 --> 20:58.006
Won't give me a dime.
Come on, not a dime!

20:58.533 --> 21:01.843
Then he gets ugly and punches me.
Nobody does that to me.

21:02.013 --> 21:05.608
l don't have my strength back,
or he'd be gumming Cream of Wheat.

21:05.893 --> 21:08.133
There. That's the place he lives at.

21:09.173 --> 21:11.892
-He's got the pawnshop stuff there?
-l don't know.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.403
Sit here while l run
this past my lieutenant.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.803
STEVE: Yeah.
-Just sit.

21:19.413 --> 21:21.768
DONNA: l need to get to Medavoy's.
WOMAN: Yeah, okay.

21:21.933 --> 21:25.608
MARTlNEZ: l've got this guy who's
got some information on the pawnshop.

21:29.293 --> 21:32.365
Donna, what's a girl like you
doing with this crowd here?

21:33.333 --> 21:35.164
lt's a good place to work.

21:35.333 --> 21:38.564
l don't get it. l mean, what's
the product you're turning out here?

21:38.733 --> 21:40.325
Ever think about that?

21:40.493 --> 21:42.290
Jailbirds?

21:42.453 --> 21:45.331
ls that what life's about
for a beautiful girl like you?

21:45.493 --> 21:48.087
Hey, sorry, l didn't mean to, l'm sorry.

21:48.613 --> 21:49.841
MARTlNEZ: Steve.
STEVE: Uh-huh.

21:50.013 --> 21:52.527
-How'd we come out?
-We want you to do something for us.

21:52.693 --> 21:54.046
-ls that so?
-Mm-hm.

21:54.253 --> 21:56.767
STEVE: lmagine that.
-Hello, Martinez.

21:57.493 --> 22:00.371
-How's it going?
-You go out picking my son up?

22:00.533 --> 22:02.763
MARTlNEZ: Yeah, l did.
-l appreciate that.

22:02.933 --> 22:05.367
No trouble. Glad to help.

22:05.573 --> 22:06.562
Steve, come here.

22:06.733 --> 22:08.485
SlPOWlCZ
Forget about it. l'll call back later.

22:09.333 --> 22:10.448
l want to tell you how this works.

22:10.613 --> 22:12.524
STEVE: l get paid for this?
-How you doing, Dan?

22:12.693 --> 22:14.809
-l just came from Bellevue.
-Come here.

22:14.973 --> 22:19.125
-They got him calmed down.
-Sit down.

22:19.493 --> 22:23.930
l hope none of your boys got hurt
bringing him in. ls he charged?

22:24.253 --> 22:25.732
No.

22:26.453 --> 22:30.651
Dan, l'm gonna be straight with you.
You gotta change your situation.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.812
What do you mean?

22:33.093 --> 22:36.847
The DA's not gonna find Danny
competent to face the assault charges. . .

22:37.053 --> 22:40.409
. . .and once he's medicated,
he's gonna be released.

22:41.933 --> 22:44.163
Now, l'm afraid for your safety.

22:44.333 --> 22:49.202
You gotta move out. Go find another
apartment and don't tell Danny where.

22:50.413 --> 22:52.165
You mean, never see him again?

22:52.373 --> 22:54.728
-He's my son.
-l didn't say never.

22:54.973 --> 22:58.727
Give it six months or a year.
See if he stays on the medication.

22:59.093 --> 23:01.812
You know, when he's on
the medication, he's okay.

23:02.213 --> 23:05.922
He can clean up around the house.
He can go to the store.

23:06.213 --> 23:09.285
And talking, you know,
he's got real insights.

23:12.253 --> 23:15.006
Maybe l could move out. . .

23:15.173 --> 23:17.084
. . .and keep up the rent a while. . .

23:17.253 --> 23:19.448
. . .and then he could
be there by himself.

23:19.653 --> 23:21.405
lf you can afford that, that's great.

23:21.573 --> 23:25.930
The main thing is, don't expose
yourself to any more violence.

23:27.133 --> 23:29.363
lt's the right thing.

23:29.933 --> 23:32.003
Danny has to learn that there. . .

23:32.333 --> 23:34.801
. . .are consequences to what he does.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.891
He's a grown man.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.693
He has to follow the rules
like everybody else.

23:39.693 --> 23:40.205
He has to follow the rules
like everybody else.

23:40.533 --> 23:42.444
Once you move out. . .

23:42.613 --> 23:45.969
. . .get the keys to me. l'll pick
him up and take him over there.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.486
l shouldn't be there?

23:47.733 --> 23:50.406
lf you want to say goodbye,
and l'll be there with you.

23:50.573 --> 23:53.167
But you should have another place
to go to.

23:53.373 --> 23:56.968
You know, that way l can give him
instructions, explain what's what.

23:57.173 --> 24:01.371
-You can't tell him where you're going.
-l understand.

24:02.333 --> 24:07.726
l can do it. l'll just grab some place.
l don't have to be choosy.

24:08.213 --> 24:11.330
Queens. l like the idea of Queens,
that way l can. . .

24:11.493 --> 24:14.405
. . .get in every day for my meetings.

24:15.613 --> 24:18.810
Maybe it'll be good for him
in the long run.

24:19.533 --> 24:20.522
Maybe.

24:22.133 --> 24:24.442
l'll get my stuff together.

24:24.613 --> 24:26.285
And l'll contact you.

24:27.013 --> 24:29.129
And you can bring him over.

24:30.213 --> 24:33.285
Any help l can give
you with the move. . . .

24:33.453 --> 24:35.523
l don't have much stuff.

24:52.693 --> 24:54.763

l hope he's smart enough not
to let this guy search him.

25:37.773 --> 25:40.048
l don't want to hear
about that pawnshop.

25:42.213 --> 25:44.363

But you know we was supposed
to be together on that job.

25:47.773 --> 25:50.970
And l keep saying that pawnshop
wasn't me.

25:51.253 --> 25:53.972
This is Steve you're talking
to. Look me in the eye. . .

25:54.133 --> 25:57.330
. . .and say you didn't rob the shop
using my Groucho glass disguise. . .

25:57.493 --> 26:01.406
-. . .and the rest of my concept. Go ahead.
-l didn't do it.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.483
Easy or wasn't it, huh?

26:10.773 --> 26:13.446
Twenty thousand dollars you
got. The paper said $20,000.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.444
-l'm gonna do something here.
-Go ahead.

26:15.853 --> 26:18.413
But if we don't come to some
kind of agreement. . .

26:18.573 --> 26:20.484
. . .l'm gonna kick your ass instead.

26:21.173 --> 26:22.891
STEVE:
What type of agreement?

26:28.133 --> 26:30.488
WELDON:
l'm gonna give you 25-- Hey!

26:34.493 --> 26:38.725
One more word about that pawnshop,
you're liable to go out that window.

26:38.933 --> 26:42.209
-We're cut off.
-l'll bet Steve disconnected the wire.

26:42.373 --> 26:45.206
We got no confession
from this guy Weldon, James.

26:57.293 --> 27:00.842
MARTlNEZ: Get over here, you creep!
STEVE: What? What? What'd l do?

27:01.013 --> 27:02.571
-Keep your mouth shut.
-Hey! What?

27:02.733 --> 27:05.167
-Keep your mouth shut.
-l didn't do nothing.

27:07.253 --> 27:09.483
WELDON:
What do you want now, Steve?

27:09.653 --> 27:11.245
MEDAVO Y: Police!
MARTlNEZ: Get down. Get down.

27:11.413 --> 27:14.689
WELDON: What? What'd we do, huh?
MEDAVO Y: Hands behind your back!

27:14.933 --> 27:18.562
WELDON: How'd this happen, Steve?
-l'm shocked. These guys grabbed me.

27:18.733 --> 27:20.724
-l don't go with no coincidence.
MARTlNEZ: Got guns?

27:20.933 --> 27:23.322
No, l don't got no guns.
What do you think this is?

27:23.493 --> 27:24.812
MARTlNEZ:
Quite a watch collection.

27:31.373 --> 27:34.922
-How you doing, Sal?
-l want a change of clothes and a shave.

27:36.093 --> 27:40.291
lf you would just corroborate
what Rudy told us, we'll take a break.

27:40.453 --> 27:44.492
-Why corroborate what's not true?
-He didn't want to rob, you guys did.

27:44.773 --> 27:47.082
That's why he made you drop him off.

27:47.253 --> 27:50.928
l keep telling you he wasn't with us.
l don't know what he's talking about.

27:51.133 --> 27:54.808
He's sick over what you guys did.
He's in the hospital over it.

27:55.013 --> 27:57.527
You see, we're putting
this case together, Sal.

27:57.973 --> 28:00.931
lnstead of wasting your time fronting. . .

28:01.133 --> 28:03.647
. . .you ought to do yourself some good.

28:03.853 --> 28:08.131
Bobby says you weren't driving, he was
driving. That's gonna be important, Sal.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.608
The driver may get some slack.

28:10.773 --> 28:14.004
You ought to get
in front of that one now.

28:14.173 --> 28:17.961
-Bobby wasn't driving. l can prove that.
-How?

28:18.173 --> 28:22.610
-Bobby was too drunk to drive.
-So who pulled the hooker into the car?

28:22.893 --> 28:24.690
There wasn't no hooker.

28:24.973 --> 28:28.090
-We didn't have no money for a hooker.
SlMONE: You were after her money.

28:28.693 --> 28:31.253
You went out to rape
and rob a hooker. . .

28:31.413 --> 28:33.165
. . .and use her money to go drinking. . .

28:33.333 --> 28:37.485
. . .and something happened in that car
there, and that hooker got killed.

28:39.733 --> 28:42.293
There wasn't no hooker.

28:46.253 --> 28:48.005
All right.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.962
l'm gonna tell you, Bobby, you do
not wanna go to bat on this one.

28:56.133 --> 28:59.842
You do not want a jury looking
at photos of that woman's body.

29:03.973 --> 29:08.171
Have you got any idea how much heat
a burning tire puts out?

29:09.213 --> 29:11.443
You know how we
knew she was pregnant?

29:12.093 --> 29:14.049
We could see that fetus.

29:14.293 --> 29:16.488
Her flesh was all burned away.

29:16.773 --> 29:18.570
You listening, Bobby?

29:19.213 --> 29:21.807
Know how a jury's gonna feel
looking at those pictures?

29:22.013 --> 29:23.526
We didn't do it.

29:23.693 --> 29:28.403
We balled her and we let her go. lf
someone else did something, l'm sorry.

29:28.613 --> 29:30.251
l'm very tired.

29:30.733 --> 29:32.963
Well, you count on two things, Bobby.

29:34.053 --> 29:36.726
You're gonna get a lot more tired.

29:36.933 --> 29:40.005
And before this is over,
you're gonna tell me the truth.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.323
l cannot move this son of a bitch.

29:56.493 --> 29:59.803
The other one won't cop
that they picked her up still.

30:00.573 --> 30:02.165
You want to grab an hour?

30:03.453 --> 30:07.890
They're gonna release Danny.
l'm gonna take him and see his dad.

30:09.693 --> 30:11.604
You should give a whack
at this asshole.

30:11.773 --> 30:14.492
l'll give him a few minutes.
Let him think he can sleep.

30:14.653 --> 30:17.326
STEVE: Shut up.
WELDON: Wait till this gets out, Steve.

30:17.493 --> 30:19.324
You've got it wrong.
They staked you out.

30:19.493 --> 30:21.484
-Steve's a stool pigeon!
-Shut up, Weldon.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.042
WELDON: A lousy snitch.
MEDAVO Y: l told you to shut up.

30:24.253 --> 30:28.804
You better hope you never go back to
the joint. You'll get shanked first day.

30:30.013 --> 30:31.844
One and 2 are in use.

30:32.013 --> 30:33.526
l'll take him to Anti-crime.

30:33.733 --> 30:36.327
l'll voucher the property
and talk to the boss.

30:36.493 --> 30:39.132
-The first day, Steve.
MEDAVO Y: Move it, Weldon.

30:39.293 --> 30:41.409
You're lucky l don't
kick your ass, Steve.

30:41.613 --> 30:43.490
-l don't know what you mean.
-You don't?

30:43.653 --> 30:47.043
You disconnected that wire
when the guy offered you $2500.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.885
You may take a collar for that.

30:49.053 --> 30:53.569
lf that wire didn't work, something
technical went wrong. Can't blame me.

30:55.413 --> 30:57.131
You don't use a lot of makeup,
do you?

30:57.293 --> 30:59.807
-Excuse me. l have work to do.
STEVE: No problem.

31:01.373 --> 31:02.772
MARTlNEZ:
Lieutenant.

31:02.933 --> 31:06.050
Yeah, okay, just give me a call
as soon as something breaks.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.202
How'd you make out?

31:08.533 --> 31:12.321
He had jewelry from the pawnshop.
l don't know if the search will hold up.

31:12.693 --> 31:15.924
-You get probable cause on tape?
-This Steve, who wore the wire?

31:16.093 --> 31:17.765
The other guy wouldn't admit to it.

31:17.933 --> 31:19.969
But he tells Steve
he'll give him $2500.

31:20.133 --> 31:23.011
All of a sudden, the wire goes dead.
Steve kills the wire.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.733
-So then we went in.
-So we might lose the search.

31:25.893 --> 31:28.407
Should we bring in the ones
who got robbed?

31:28.733 --> 31:30.724
Yeah. Yeah, bring them in
for a lineup.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.686
Okay.

31:36.453 --> 31:41.129
Donna, this is Mrs. Santiago. l think
she should talk to Detective Simone.

31:41.373 --> 31:44.046
What's going on, sarge?
Get off of there.

31:44.213 --> 31:47.410
-This is Valeria Santiago.
SlMONE: How do you do, ma'am?

31:47.613 --> 31:50.730
She came in to report her daughter's
missing, talked to me about it.

31:50.893 --> 31:53.088
l think maybe she should talk to you.

31:54.053 --> 31:55.805
Come on in, Mrs. Santiago.

31:57.853 --> 32:01.562
Have a seat right here.
When did you last see your daughter?

32:01.733 --> 32:04.201
Two days ago l spoke to her.

32:04.373 --> 32:06.568
She was supposed to come to see me.

32:06.733 --> 32:09.611
l am afraid she was in an accident.

32:09.813 --> 32:14.091
-l want to know if something happened.
-Give me her name. We'll run a check.

32:14.253 --> 32:16.050
Carmela Santiago.

32:16.573 --> 32:20.168
She's 22. She was supposed
to come two days ago.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.170
Maybe she'll show up today.

32:22.413 --> 32:25.291
l'm afraid that maybe
she's in the hospital or something.

32:25.453 --> 32:27.330
Why would you think that?

32:27.493 --> 32:31.247
She's going to have a baby soon.

32:31.573 --> 32:35.612
Maybe something happened too early.

32:36.253 --> 32:38.448
She doesn't have anybody
that lives with her?

32:38.693 --> 32:39.682
No.

32:40.093 --> 32:43.722
Let me have her address.
We'll go see what we can find out.

32:44.733 --> 32:46.485
l don't know her address.

32:46.973 --> 32:52.172
She moves a lot.
Stays with people. Her friends.

32:52.493 --> 32:53.972
She have a job?

32:54.133 --> 32:56.089
-She's a waitress.
-Where?

32:56.693 --> 32:59.253
l don't know. She never told me.

32:59.813 --> 33:01.610
Mrs. Santiago. . .

33:02.733 --> 33:05.088
. . .please don't take offense to this.

33:05.253 --> 33:08.848
Could she be involved in some things
she didn't want you to know?

33:09.133 --> 33:10.248
What things?

33:10.893 --> 33:12.849
Drugs. Prostitution.

33:13.333 --> 33:14.732
ls she in trouble?

33:15.053 --> 33:16.042
Arrested?

33:16.213 --> 33:19.603
Mrs. Santiago, do you know if
Carmela--? lt's Carmela, right?

33:19.773 --> 33:22.651
Did she go to a dentist?
Would you know her dentist?

33:22.813 --> 33:25.691
No, she wouldn't take care of her teeth.

33:26.013 --> 33:29.801
Do you know if she ever had
an accident where she broke her leg?

33:30.333 --> 33:31.925
Yes.

33:32.493 --> 33:36.532
Somebody knocked her down some stairs
a couple of years ago.

33:37.053 --> 33:40.728
-She broke her left leg.
-Above the knee?

33:41.973 --> 33:44.726
-What's happened to her?
-lt may not be her. . .

33:44.893 --> 33:48.090
. . .but a woman was found dead,
who fits what you've told me.

33:48.253 --> 33:51.086
She was pregnant. The coroner
said her left leg was fractured.

33:51.293 --> 33:55.605
-Where is she? Let me go see.
-This woman was burned in a fire.

33:56.053 --> 33:58.806
You wouldn't be able to recognize her.

34:00.893 --> 34:03.407
So it might not be Carmela.

34:06.733 --> 34:09.371
Ma'am, do you happen to have
a recent photo of your daughter?

34:09.533 --> 34:11.284
Yeah.

34:11.853 --> 34:13.445
lt's. . .

34:13.813 --> 34:16.452
-. . .from her sister's wedding.
-l'll need that.

34:16.612 --> 34:20.731
Do you know the hospital where
she was treated for the broken leg?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.926
Lincoln Hospital. This is her picture.

34:25.893 --> 34:27.406
Do we have your number?

34:27.652 --> 34:31.282
Yes. l gave it to the sergeant
at the desk.

34:32.373 --> 34:34.887
Why don't you go home now,
Mrs. Santiago?

34:35.053 --> 34:37.203
Let me look into this, all right?

34:42.493 --> 34:44.290
Oh. . . .

34:45.453 --> 34:47.920
That girl that you found. . .

34:48.092 --> 34:52.643
-. . .was she Puerto Rican?
-We don't know if this is your daughter.

34:57.573 --> 35:01.327
Maybe that girl was not
even Puerto Rican.

35:23.813 --> 35:25.804
My partner's got something
to show you.

35:26.013 --> 35:27.492
What's this about?

35:27.893 --> 35:29.884
Out. Sit.

35:35.053 --> 35:37.248
Before and after, Bobby.

35:37.413 --> 35:39.165
This is Carmela Santiago.

35:39.613 --> 35:43.811
We took this picture to the stroll on First
and 1 0th, and our witness lD'd her. . .

35:43.973 --> 35:47.170
. . .as the woman that you guys
dragged into that 4x4.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.370
And this burned up woman. . .

35:49.533 --> 35:52.730
. . .who you assholes thought we
wouldn't be able to make an lD on. . .

35:52.933 --> 35:54.733
. . .she was identified
through medical records.

35:54.733 --> 35:55.483
. . .she was identified
through medical records.

35:55.693 --> 35:57.331
Carmela Santiago.

35:57.653 --> 35:58.927
Same girl. . .

35:59.173 --> 36:02.051
. . .dumped out of that
same 4x4. . .

36:02.213 --> 36:04.124
. . .underneath the Manhattan Bridge.

36:05.253 --> 36:07.448
All that's left now, Bobby. . .

36:07.813 --> 36:10.088
. . .is how we're gonna charge you.

36:10.253 --> 36:13.882
lf you both intended to do this,
maybe you shouldn't say a thing.

36:14.053 --> 36:15.327
But if it was an accident. . .

36:15.493 --> 36:18.565
. . .or if it was one of you
more than the other. . .

36:18.733 --> 36:21.486
. . .then this is the last
chance you've got.

36:28.013 --> 36:30.004
lt was Sal.

36:34.773 --> 36:36.650
You wanted money to party.

36:36.813 --> 36:38.804
You decided to mug a hooker.

36:38.973 --> 36:42.329
lt was Sal's idea. They're out,
pulling in the bread. You know.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.922
Sure. Like a drive-up teller.

36:45.253 --> 36:46.845
We tried to pick up this other one.

36:47.013 --> 36:50.164
She wanted to see money,
so we stopped for this one.

36:51.333 --> 36:53.324
She was getting in.
She changed her mind.

36:53.493 --> 36:56.007
Maybe Sal didn't look right.
So he grabbed her.

36:56.173 --> 36:59.051
She was strong, man,
banging and yelling back there.

37:00.013 --> 37:03.050
He finally got her under control,
and when l stopped. . .

37:03.213 --> 37:07.764
. . .there was a baseball bat back there,
and he had it pressed against her throat.

37:09.133 --> 37:12.170
-That's how he got control over her.
-By killing her.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.688
We didn't know that right away.

37:15.293 --> 37:17.853
We were trying to find a place
to stop and leave her.

37:18.013 --> 37:20.447
But then we seen she went
and died on us.

37:21.373 --> 37:25.366
And so you decided to burn her up.

37:27.053 --> 37:31.205
lt was Sal's idea, man. Get rid
of the evidence. We were just shook up.

37:31.373 --> 37:35.685
We were driving around, trying to think.
This was not supposed to happen.

37:35.893 --> 37:38.646
lt just took us by surprise.
lt was bad luck.

37:40.973 --> 37:42.725
Wake up, Sal.

37:48.373 --> 37:52.127
Bobby flipped on you, man.
We're booking you for murder.

37:53.133 --> 37:55.886
-You're full of crap.
-He's gonna testify against you.

37:56.053 --> 38:00.410
He told us how you choked that girl
with that bat. Get up.

38:03.093 --> 38:05.527
So, what, was he lying?

38:06.293 --> 38:09.808
-Was he the one with a bat?
-You're all liars! There wasn't no hooker.

38:09.973 --> 38:12.771
-How could l kill her?
-You stick with it, Sal.

-You didn't see the crime perpetrated.

38:38.413 --> 38:40.927
