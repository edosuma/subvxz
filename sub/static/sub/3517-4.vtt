00:21.532 --> 00:23.534
Strange not seeing
your name up there.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.352
"To improve is to change..."

00:25.353 --> 00:27.020
"To perfect
is to change often."

00:27.021 --> 00:28.857
You know your Churchill.

00:28.922 --> 00:30.438
Inscribed on the
watch you gave me

00:30.439 --> 00:32.232
- when I left for Glendon Hill.
- Was it?

00:32.234 --> 00:34.818
- Nancy arranges all the gifts.
- She knows you well.

00:34.819 --> 00:37.778
- As much as I'm enjoying this little...
- I got you two more votes.

00:37.780 --> 00:40.823
Partridge and Krauss.

00:40.824 --> 00:43.282
Is this Raymond's way
of extending an olive branch?

00:43.283 --> 00:47.411
- It's a start.
- Two votes is a twig. It's not a branch.

00:47.412 --> 00:51.288
- Which is why I'm here.
- Well, the vote is at 5:00.

00:51.289 --> 00:54.792
- We have less than three hours.
- Two hours and 49 minutes.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.836
- We have made more happen in less.
- Is that the watch?

00:57.837 --> 01:03.091
- No, it's nicer. - So why did Raymond
have a change of heart?

01:03.092 --> 01:05.342
If the government grinds
to a halt, that benefits no one.

01:05.343 --> 01:09.345
We want the president focused on China,
not distracted by furloughs and protests.

01:09.346 --> 01:12.180
You take direction
from Jacqueline.

01:12.181 --> 01:13.681
She's not gonna
like that very much.

01:13.683 --> 01:15.725
- Bossing you around?
- Having me around.

01:15.726 --> 01:18.602
I don't blame her.

01:18.603 --> 01:20.645
Ashleigh will start
the interview with questions

01:20.646 --> 01:23.397
about how you and your husband
met, your early marriage.

01:23.398 --> 01:25.942
- Fine.
- Then she'll move on to more specific

01:25.943 --> 01:31.737
- questions about your recent transition.
- All right.

01:31.738 --> 01:34.448
She's gonna ask about you
having no children.

01:34.449 --> 01:36.408
I thought we agreed
to take that off the table.

01:36.409 --> 01:37.659
We did, but they insisted.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.618
Now, I can speak
to Ashleigh directly and...

01:39.619 --> 01:41.620
No, no. It's fine. I've been
asked the question before.

01:41.621 --> 01:43.622
- I know how to answer it.
- It'll be quick and painless.

01:43.623 --> 01:46.874
I'll confirm that with Ashleigh
when she gets here.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.543
- I like it.
- Maybe something less neutral.

01:49.544 --> 01:53.672
I'm sure you'll look good in
whatever you choose. I'll be downstairs.

01:57.175 --> 02:00.176
Disori owes you for the
overpass funding you secured.

02:00.177 --> 02:02.053
- Yes, he does.
- I'll call him.

02:02.054 --> 02:03.846
- Where's Doug?
- He's doing the rounds.

02:03.847 --> 02:06.347
Making sure our
hard ones stay hard.

02:06.348 --> 02:09.100
Birch and Womack are doing the same.
But we're still 15 short.

02:09.101 --> 02:11.435
I've got relationships
with most of these folks.

02:11.436 --> 02:14.771
Money's not enough.
I already tried the D-trip route.

02:14.772 --> 02:16.647
Retirement age is
the main sticking point?

02:16.648 --> 02:19.275
- Old people vote.
- I'll target the AARP.

02:19.276 --> 02:21.943
- That'll take most of the heat off.
- We're wasting time.

02:21.944 --> 02:24.695
- I gotta get to work.
- Take Remy with you.

02:24.696 --> 02:26.113
Shouldn't we divide and conquer?

02:26.114 --> 02:28.782
It's harder to say no
twice than once.

02:28.783 --> 02:29.991
I'll stay out of your way.

02:29.992 --> 02:31.492
Like you did
on the watershed act?

02:31.493 --> 02:32.993
We're on the same
side of the fence.

02:32.994 --> 02:34.535
You're late to the party.

02:34.536 --> 02:36.537
Think of Remy as the guy
who shows up

02:36.538 --> 02:39.166
with a six-pack after
the liquor stores close.

02:39.167 --> 02:41.834
- Who's on your plate?
- Donald Blythe.

02:41.835 --> 02:44.085
Do you really think that's
the best use of your time?

02:44.086 --> 02:46.045
If I can get him
to turn his people.

02:46.046 --> 02:47.880
A lot of eggs
to put in one basket.

02:47.881 --> 02:49.299
We only have one basket.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.008
Jacqueline,
may I use your office,

02:52.009 --> 02:55.846
- for old time's sake? - I serve at the
pleasure of the vice president.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.350
Two hours and 17 minutes.

03:04.351 --> 03:08.313
Normally all I need to sway
Donald Blythe is patience and time,

03:08.314 --> 03:10.648
neither of which
I have right now.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.693
Tick tock.

03:13.719 --> 04:50.715
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

04:53.187 --> 04:56.897
- Donald. Good to see you.
- Mr. Vice President.

04:56.898 --> 04:59.107
Please,
it's always Frank to you.

04:59.108 --> 05:02.318
I came because you asked me,
but don't mistake that for false hope.

05:02.319 --> 05:04.195
If you have other people
to lobby, you should.

05:04.196 --> 05:06.487
- Ten minutes.
- It won't change anything.

05:06.488 --> 05:08.907
Well, at the very least,
enjoy the free coffee.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.075
- I don't drink caffeine.
- Then decaf.

05:11.076 --> 05:13.911
- Still has caffeine.
- Well, enjoy the free oxygen.

05:13.912 --> 05:16.162
It gets stuffy over there
in the Longworth building.

05:16.163 --> 05:18.915
- Coffee for me, and...
- Seltzer water, if you have it.

05:18.916 --> 05:20.875
I'm sure we do.

05:24.879 --> 05:29.464
Now, I can understand
if you might hold a grudge.

05:29.465 --> 05:32.007
I don't hold grudges, Frank.
I just don't negotiate

05:32.008 --> 05:34.343
with people who are
fundamentally deceptive.

05:34.344 --> 05:36.010
I never lied to you, Donald.

05:36.011 --> 05:38.679
You promised to seek my counsel,
which you never once did.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.724
We had to move the education bill in
a direction I knew would make you unhappy.

05:42.725 --> 05:45.268
- I saw no reason to frustrate...
- You eviscerated the unions.

05:45.269 --> 05:48.146
- You federalized performance standards.
- If we hadn't done that,

05:48.147 --> 05:49.814
the bill would've
been dead in the water.

05:49.815 --> 05:51.190
Now you want to cut
the pathetic level

05:51.191 --> 05:52.732
of funding you
did manage to pass.

05:52.733 --> 05:56.026
Isn't some funding better
than none?

05:56.027 --> 05:59.154
A flatline will send a louder
message than life support.

05:59.155 --> 06:04.158
Look, I'm impressed with the
little coalition you've cobbled together,

06:04.159 --> 06:08.078
- but we...
- Not so little. Twenty-eight votes.

06:08.079 --> 06:11.998
- And you need them all.
- Well, really only half.

06:11.999 --> 06:16.168
- Half of zero is still zero.
- I had to pull every trick in the book

06:16.169 --> 06:18.669
to get entitlement through
the Senate. If it fails in the House,

06:18.671 --> 06:21.088
we don't get a round two.
This is a one-time deal.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.632
It should never have passed
the Senate to begin with.

06:24.633 --> 06:28.636
Can we start over?
May I offer you an apology?

06:28.637 --> 06:31.762
Deaf ears, Frank.

06:31.763 --> 06:36.100
I withdrew myself from the education
fight and that is my cross to bear.

06:36.101 --> 06:38.893
But I will be damned if I will
make the same mistake twice.

06:38.894 --> 06:43.440
This sort of stubbornness
makes you no better than the tea party.

06:45.191 --> 06:49.152
- Except for the fact...
- that we happen to be right.

06:49.153 --> 06:53.070
Just a few more minutes, Donald.
You haven't even had your seltzer yet.

06:53.071 --> 06:55.990
They have seven other data centers
spread across the Northeast.

06:55.991 --> 06:58.451
- Those aren't good odds.
- Well, if we can access one,

06:58.452 --> 07:00.910
I should be able to talk to the
other seven. They all look like that.

07:00.911 --> 07:03.578
- Fort Knox wrapped in a nuclear bunker.
- How do we get in?

07:03.580 --> 07:06.415
Well, we don't. You do.

07:06.416 --> 07:10.626
What...? How?
What's my reason?

07:10.627 --> 07:14.087
You're writing a story on cyberterrorism.
It's free publicity.

07:14.088 --> 07:16.214
- If they're so secure...
- They give tours all the time.

07:16.215 --> 07:19.175
- Mostly to prospective clients.
- Then why haven't you done it yourself?

07:19.176 --> 07:22.219
Because I run a white hat firm.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.557
And if I were to show up in the tour logs
before a breach, it would raise alarms.

07:28.517 --> 07:31.352
OK. Once I'm in?

07:33.020 --> 07:34.854
These are what
servers look like.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.189
If you can get inside one of
these cages, you will have this.

07:37.190 --> 07:41.859
You slide it into
the server. VoilÃ .

07:41.860 --> 07:44.361
- It's that simple?
- Yeah. Well, your part, not mine.

07:44.362 --> 07:47.322
- Code's extremely complex.
- How do I do it without them noticing?

07:47.323 --> 07:51.868
You get good at anything.
Practice makes perfect.

08:07.088 --> 08:09.090
We've got a problem.

08:12.967 --> 08:18.388
Everyone, stop what you're doing, head
into the nearest office and shut the door.

08:18.389 --> 08:21.475
You, stay exactly where you are.

08:28.272 --> 08:30.313
Retirement age is a done deal.

08:30.314 --> 08:32.482
I might be able to
redistribute some appropriations...

08:32.482 --> 08:36.650
That's not what I'm after. You can't fix
a wrecked car with new hubcaps.

08:36.652 --> 08:39.736
How about a sister bill?
One that focuses entirely on education.

08:39.738 --> 08:42.655
My coalition is fighting
for the integrity of the party.

08:42.657 --> 08:44.657
We're not just
focused on education...

08:44.658 --> 08:46.617
I'm sorry, Donald.
Excuse me.

08:46.618 --> 08:49.912
Nancy, I said no interrup...

08:49.914 --> 08:51.705
When?

08:51.706 --> 08:54.541
But the vote is in
less than an hour. I...

08:54.542 --> 09:00.169
I don't care what protocol... Quarantine.
There's white powder in the mail.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.672
- We're locked in?
- Sir! Close the door now!

09:03.673 --> 09:07.051
- Look, I have to...
- Now, sir! Please!

09:08.553 --> 09:12.430
- I should call my wife.
- And I should call Claire.

09:12.431 --> 09:16.349
- Should I tell Connor?
<i>- No. It's better the press doesn't know.</i>

09:16.350 --> 09:18.851
Field tests should come in before the vote.
Soon as the tally's in,

09:18.852 --> 09:21.061
- I'll come home.
<i>- How's it looking?</i>

09:21.062 --> 09:23.439
Shaky. We may lose this one.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.982
That could make
for a tough interview.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.109
<i>Well, I didn't want</i>
<i>to do it in the first place.</i>

09:28.110 --> 09:29.901
Well, we're committed now.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.571
<i>I better get</i>
<i>back to the holy crusader.</i>

09:32.572 --> 09:34.863
Let me know as soon
as the tests have cleared.

09:34.864 --> 09:36.532
If we're lucky,
it'll be anthrax.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.242
I won't live long enough
to see the bill fail.

09:38.243 --> 09:41.244
- Don't say that.
<i>- We're gonna be fine.</i>

09:41.245 --> 09:43.621
<i>How many of these quarantines</i>
<i>we been through?</i>

09:43.622 --> 09:46.372
- I've lost count.
- <i> Wish me luck with Donald.</i>

09:46.373 --> 09:48.833
Heels crossed.

09:48.834 --> 09:51.294
- It's ripping the caucus apart.
- Of course.

09:51.295 --> 09:54.045
We took a united stand
on our version of the bill.

09:54.046 --> 09:57.632
- Some of us have to stay on our feet.
- This is about party unity.

09:57.633 --> 10:01.384
- It's about abandoning our base.
- No. That's what the freeze is.

10:01.385 --> 10:03.261
Our base doesn't benefit
from sword rattling.

10:03.262 --> 10:05.262
It gets left
bleeding on the field.

10:05.263 --> 10:08.182
My district has the third largest number
of seniors in the country.

10:08.183 --> 10:11.809
If we raise the age
of retirement, the AARP will raise hell.

10:11.810 --> 10:14.353
I spoke with the president
of the AARP this morning.

10:14.354 --> 10:17.271
They'll be receiving
a 45 million dollar endowment next week.

10:17.272 --> 10:19.273
Voters will still revolt.

10:19.274 --> 10:21.359
The midterms are gonna be ugly.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.360
Many, and I can speak
for myself...

10:23.361 --> 10:26.655
The choice is between immediate
discontinuation of services

10:26.656 --> 10:29.114
and an age bump
five years from now.

10:29.115 --> 10:33.284
You're comparing theoretical
discomfort to imminent pain.

10:33.285 --> 10:35.911
I just feel like we're losing
touch with our core values.

10:35.912 --> 10:38.288
The education bill
was a good example.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.666
We all followed Frank's lead,
hoping it would buy us

10:40.667 --> 10:44.461
- traction with the Republicans.
- Would you excuse me? Just one moment.

10:48.422 --> 10:50.756
- Does the press know?
- Not yet.

10:50.757 --> 10:52.675
Can you keep in touch with him?

10:52.676 --> 10:55.968
I need to pummel our lunch
guests into submission.

10:55.969 --> 10:59.304
You got 'em close,
but relax. Listen more.

10:59.305 --> 11:02.848
They want their hands held,
not someone in their face.

11:02.850 --> 11:05.934
I know how to whip votes.

11:05.935 --> 11:08.062
Best caviar in DC,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:08.063 --> 11:10.146
- We can't let you pay for that.
- Then don't eat it.

11:10.147 --> 11:13.691
But if you do,
I won't tell anyone.

11:13.692 --> 11:16.318
You were saying
about the education bill...

11:29.246 --> 11:34.708
No, Marjory, honey. Remember,
we just talked about it.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.167
I was telling you...

11:37.126 --> 11:39.421
Right. Nothing to worry about.

11:41.046 --> 11:43.172
If you have any questions,
ask Molly.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.299
She knows what's going on.

11:47.134 --> 11:50.303
I will call as soon
as I know anything.

11:52.222 --> 11:54.140
I love you.

11:57.059 --> 11:58.893
How's Marjory?

12:04.356 --> 12:08.526
- She's OK.
- Long call.

12:08.527 --> 12:13.405
You know, she... gets emotional.

12:13.406 --> 12:16.197
Molly took a semester off
to be at home.

12:16.198 --> 12:18.324
I told her she needs
to head back in the spring.

12:18.325 --> 12:21.827
I don't want her mother
dragging her down.

12:21.828 --> 12:25.414
- Must be hard on you.
- Harder on the girls, I think.

12:25.415 --> 12:29.292
- Is she lucid?
- About half the time.

12:29.293 --> 12:33.587
Just enough to be aware
of how quickly she's going.

12:33.588 --> 12:35.715
It's awful.

12:39.383 --> 12:46.012
I feel terrible saying it, but part of me
is looking forward to her not being lucid.

12:46.013 --> 12:49.391
At least then she won't
realize what's happening.

12:51.101 --> 12:53.268
I should have thought
of this before.

12:53.269 --> 12:56.105
Appeal to the heart,
not the brain.

12:57.648 --> 12:59.690
Forgive my ignorance, but...

12:59.691 --> 13:03.485
...has there been any
progress with research?

13:03.486 --> 13:09.406
Some. Genetic testing,
vascular manipulation. But it's slow.

13:09.407 --> 13:12.451
They won't come up with
anything in time for Marjory.

13:12.452 --> 13:16.495
We're focusing on quality of life.
Look, I know you have work to do, so...

13:16.497 --> 13:18.789
I'm no longer the whip.
That's Jacqueline's job.

13:18.790 --> 13:21.458
I just agreed to meet with you
because we have a history.

13:21.459 --> 13:23.459
She would be tougher
to say no to.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.585
But it still
would've been a "no."

13:25.586 --> 13:29.963
- Yes.
- I admire your convictions, Donald.

13:29.964 --> 13:31.923
You're a rare breed nowadays.

13:31.924 --> 13:34.550
It didn't sound that way when
you were comparing us to the tea party.

13:34.551 --> 13:39.137
I was being unfair. You're not
a reactionary. You're a progressive.

13:39.138 --> 13:44.351
- I see where this is going.
- How do you mean?

13:44.352 --> 13:49.521
When you've been in the
wasteland as long as I have,
you become immune to flattery.

13:49.522 --> 13:52.731
I know you think I'm
fundamentally deceptive,

13:52.732 --> 13:55.442
but I am capable
of a genuine compliment.

13:55.443 --> 13:58.736
Then I will take it as one,
but it won't soften my resolve.

13:58.737 --> 14:02.782
If it did, you wouldn't deserve
the compliment in the first place.

14:02.783 --> 14:05.367
If you vote no,
I won't hold it against you.

14:05.368 --> 14:08.285
We are all in this together
through the midterms.

14:08.286 --> 14:14.415
But, if you stick with me,
we can show both the Republicans

14:14.416 --> 14:18.001
and the American people that
we are capable of more than stagnation.

14:18.002 --> 14:21.296
And that's worth something,
even if it hurts.

14:23.756 --> 14:25.842
Who can I count on?

14:46.525 --> 14:48.317
Copy that.

14:56.073 --> 14:59.576
The fact that there's still
a door between us, I take as a bad sign.

14:59.577 --> 15:01.993
One tested negative,
one inconclusive, sir.

15:01.994 --> 15:04.120
That means we have to take
the samples to the lab.

15:04.121 --> 15:06.955
- So how much longer?
- Another three or four hours.

15:06.956 --> 15:10.792
We have an important vote going to the
floor. I have to be talking to my people.

15:10.793 --> 15:14.545
The vote is delayed, sir.
We're evacuating this side of the Capitol.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.547
- So no vote?
- Not until we get the all-clear.

15:17.548 --> 15:20.508
- Good things happen to good people.
- Another thing, sir.

15:20.509 --> 15:24.636
All cell phone service, WiFi,
land lines, we'll be blocking them,

15:24.637 --> 15:26.804
in case there's
a legitimate security threat.

15:26.806 --> 15:30.307
- I need to be able to call my wife!
- I apologize, sir.

15:30.308 --> 15:33.476
- We can have someone notify her.
- No, it needs to be me.

15:33.477 --> 15:35.854
She gets very anxious
if she doesn't recognize the voice.

15:35.855 --> 15:37.979
Congressman, I have
strict instructions not...

15:37.980 --> 15:40.816
Figure it out, unless you want me
to get the White House involved.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.528
I'll find a way, sir.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.365
There are advantages
to being vice president.

15:52.659 --> 15:56.494
Ma'am, we'll have to ask you
to remain up here for a little while.

15:56.495 --> 15:59.246
- Is it the quarantine?
- The Capitol is being evacuated.

15:59.247 --> 16:04.125
We expect everything to be fine.
It's just standard procedure.

16:04.126 --> 16:07.086
You won't be able to get through.
Communication's being jammed.

16:07.087 --> 16:10.213
- You mean I can't even speak to Francis?
- Not until the all-clear.

16:10.214 --> 16:12.882
- How long?
- - Four hours is the estimate right now.

16:12.883 --> 16:16.636
- We're supposed to tape in 25 minutes.
- - Nothing we can do.

16:16.637 --> 16:20.639
- You OK?
- Yes.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.350
I'll go talk to Emma.

16:24.477 --> 16:26.686
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

16:30.105 --> 16:33.273
Em.

16:33.274 --> 16:35.733
- So we might have a problem.
- It's all over the news.

16:35.734 --> 16:38.610
- Yeah, it could be a while.
- Can we get audio from the vice president?

16:38.612 --> 16:41.363
Communications are being
jammed until the evacuation's over.

16:41.364 --> 16:42.864
- Have you spoken to Ashleigh?
- She thinks we should get

16:42.865 --> 16:44.491
a sat truck down here
and wait and go live.

16:44.492 --> 16:46.700
I can't guarantee
when that'll be.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.495
The vice president is quarantined
in the Capitol and we have an exclusive.

16:49.496 --> 16:51.913
The network will broadcast
whenever the hell we tell them to.

16:51.914 --> 16:54.123
<i>They're</i>
<i>holding off until you get here.</i>

16:54.124 --> 16:56.374
You should do the
interview solo.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.710
<i>- I'd rather wait.</i>
- Who knows whether we'll win the vote?

16:59.711 --> 17:02.212
If we lose, I don't want my face
on national television.

17:02.213 --> 17:05.423
- This could be a silver lining.
- <i> I don't know, Francis.</i>

17:05.424 --> 17:08.925
- I'm sure you'll be terrific.
- <i> Let me run it past Connor.</i>

17:08.926 --> 17:11.261
OK.
Thank you, we're done.

17:11.262 --> 17:16.265
- Sir, we were able to get Mrs. Blythe.
- Donald.

17:16.266 --> 17:18.308
- Marjory?
<i>- Hello?</i>

17:18.309 --> 17:21.519
- Yes, it's me, sweetheart.
- <i> It's hard to hear you.</i>

17:21.520 --> 17:25.815
- We're still stuck inside the office.
- <i> What office?</i>

17:25.816 --> 17:29.192
At the Capitol. It's going
to be a little while longer.

17:29.193 --> 17:31.652
<i>But why are you there?</i>
<i>It's Sunday.</i>

17:31.653 --> 17:34.613
- No, it's Friday, sweetheart.
- <i> Donald?</i>

17:34.614 --> 17:37.657
- I'm here.
- <i> Who is this man with me?</i>

17:37.658 --> 17:42.786
He's a police officer. They're using
walkie-talkies so we can speak.

17:42.787 --> 17:45.913
<i>- Who am I talking to?
- - It's your husband, ma'am.</i>

17:45.914 --> 17:49.040
<i>- I'm not married.</i>
- It's me. It's Donald.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.083
<i>Turn it off.</i>
<i>I don't know that man.</i>

17:51.084 --> 17:54.713
- Marjory!
- -<i> She went to the other room, sir.</i>

17:54.714 --> 17:59.799
OK, thank you.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.219
- If you could stay with her, please?
- -<i> Yes, sir.</i>

18:26.946 --> 18:28.864
Drink?

18:31.575 --> 18:34.701
Sure. Why not?

18:34.702 --> 18:37.453
For all we know, it could be
midnight before he's out.

18:37.454 --> 18:39.748
- He still needs to manage the vote.
- - We're fine if it's 2am.

18:39.749 --> 18:41.957
When everyone's asleep.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.000
- People would stay up for this.
- The whole point was primetime.

18:44.001 --> 18:45.752
- Then we do it tomorrow.
- We've already set aside

18:45.753 --> 18:47.293
half a day for this.
The vice president can't

18:47.294 --> 18:49.337
rearrange his schedule
for an interview.

18:49.339 --> 18:52.799
- I don't see any other options.
- I spoke to Francis over the radio.

18:52.800 --> 18:57.469
- We think I should do it alone.
- Just you?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.596
Mrs. Underwood and Ashleigh,
one-on-one.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.056
Maybe we can
broadcast his voice...

19:01.057 --> 19:03.223
Francis doesn't want
the entire interview

19:03.224 --> 19:04.975
to be about the quarantine.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.142
Neither do I.
That's just spectacle.

19:07.143 --> 19:09.020
The quarantine is news.
We have an opportunity...

19:09.021 --> 19:11.230
- We're done.
- What?

19:11.231 --> 19:13.356
- Cancel the interview. No reschedule.
- Come on.

19:13.357 --> 19:16.652
Please, pack up
everything and leave.

19:17.486 --> 19:20.404
OK, let me call Ashleigh.

19:22.573 --> 19:28.077
I thought I'd get used to it,
but no. Hurts every time.

19:28.078 --> 19:32.747
You spend 30 years with someone and then
they don't have a damn clue who you are.

19:35.458 --> 19:38.292
Oh... I really shouldn't.

19:38.293 --> 19:40.294
If we never did anything
we shouldn't do,

19:40.295 --> 19:42.964
we'd never feel good
about doing the things we should.

19:42.965 --> 19:46.632
- Excellent point.
- If these are our last moments on Earth,

19:46.633 --> 19:49.551
I don't know about you,
but I'd rather go out with a buzz on.

19:49.552 --> 19:53.097
To Marjory.

19:53.098 --> 19:58.392
- You love her dearly.
- More than anything.

20:01.478 --> 20:05.354
I can't imagine what I'd do
without Claire, or if she...

20:05.355 --> 20:07.732
...didn't remember who I was.

20:07.733 --> 20:10.525
- Hopefully you'll never have to.
- It makes me angry that you do.

20:10.526 --> 20:14.155
- That anybody does. - No sense being
angry over what you can't change.

20:15.530 --> 20:19.117
How much funding
does Alzheimer's research get?

20:19.118 --> 20:21.785
Just under 500 million.

20:21.786 --> 20:24.829
Well, I'm no expert, but that
sounds inadequate to me.

20:24.830 --> 20:29.040
It is. For every $100
we allocate to research,

20:29.041 --> 20:33.127
- we spend nearly $30,000 on care.
- We oughta change that.

20:33.128 --> 20:35.879
I tried. My bill didn't even
leave committee.

20:35.880 --> 20:39.256
- Who opposed it?
- Howard Webb.

20:39.257 --> 20:43.760
- Appropriations.
- He didn't even put it to a vote.

20:43.761 --> 20:48.263
- I've never been fond of Howard.
- That makes two of us.

20:48.264 --> 20:51.683
- What was his argument?
- He didn't feel he owed me one.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.727
"Fiscally irresponsible,"
is all he said.

20:54.728 --> 21:00.900
Walk me through the
specifics of your bill.

21:06.696 --> 21:10.948
- I see what you're doing.
- Doing what?

21:10.949 --> 21:13.240
- You're disgusting, Frank.
- Excuse me.

21:13.241 --> 21:15.952
- Using my wife.
- Donald, what are you saying?

21:15.953 --> 21:19.579
You think I'll give in on entitlement
if you slap some extra Alzheimer's funding

21:19.580 --> 21:21.873
- on the table?
- I was not suggesting that at all.

21:21.874 --> 21:25.167
- Bullshit, Frank.
- You think as little of me as you want,

21:25.168 --> 21:26.877
but I do not barter
with people's health.

21:26.878 --> 21:29.420
Then why are you trying to raise
the age of retirement?

21:29.421 --> 21:32.255
Medical research we can afford.
Medicare we can't.

21:32.256 --> 21:36.134
- There are realities, Donald.
- Don't talk down to me about realities.

21:36.135 --> 21:39.137
My wife is dying!
That's a reality!

21:39.138 --> 21:42.556
Other people will die, too,
if your package succeeds!

21:42.557 --> 21:46.017
That's a reality! Goddamn it,
I wish I wasn't stuck

21:46.018 --> 21:48.309
- in this fucking room with you!
- Donald.

21:48.310 --> 21:50.312
I'm done talking!

21:52.023 --> 21:53.982
- One more time.
- I've got it.

21:53.983 --> 21:56.482
I want it to sound more natural.

21:56.484 --> 21:59.861
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

21:59.862 --> 22:04.657
And we didn't feel that we could both
do that and be the parents we wanted to be.

22:04.658 --> 22:07.283
And by making that choice,
it allows more time for us

22:07.284 --> 22:09.952
- to be in the service of others.
- Good, that sounds good.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.329
We need you,
Mrs. Underwood.

22:18.168 --> 22:21.753
Keep Derek at the Capitol. I want quotes
from evacuees and Homeland Security.

22:21.754 --> 22:25.590
And Sarah should be finishing
that history of biohazard scares.

22:25.591 --> 22:28.050
I'll be there soon.

22:28.051 --> 22:30.969
- I have to go.
- No. We're not done yet.

22:30.970 --> 22:33.596
This is a major story.
I'll come back tomorrow.

22:33.597 --> 22:36.472
Come here two days in a row
and this is how patterns emerge.

22:36.473 --> 22:40.267
The FBI likes patterns. And we do not
give the FBI what the FBI likes.

22:40.268 --> 22:42.228
I can't disappear all
day in the middle of...

22:42.229 --> 22:47.231
- I have eight reporters out in the field.
- Stop!

22:47.232 --> 22:52.569
- Tell me why I purchased Cashew.
- I don't know.

22:52.570 --> 22:55.654
Companionship?

22:55.655 --> 22:57.364
Yes.

22:59.158 --> 23:02.534
But more importantly,
a reminder that I am never more

23:02.535 --> 23:06.705
than one wrong move away
from life in a cage.

23:06.706 --> 23:08.497
You stay.

23:08.498 --> 23:10.792
I'm gonna walk you through every
line of code I intend to write,

23:10.793 --> 23:13.585
every attempt I make to breach
the wall. If we get caught,

23:13.586 --> 23:16.212
you don't get to plead
ignorance. We go down together.

23:16.213 --> 23:19.672
I didn't sign up for Bonnie and Clyde.
You need me for this one thing.

23:19.673 --> 23:22.300
Just like I need you.
But whatever you've done before me...

23:24.595 --> 23:28.723
You know where I live,
and you know who I am.

23:34.560 --> 23:38.606
Sit down. The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

23:43.109 --> 23:46.736
<i>The Capitol is still on lockdown</i>
<i>as hazmat crews continue</i>

23:46.737 --> 23:48.446
<i>a thorough sweep</i>
<i>of the building.</i>

23:48.447 --> 23:50.489
<i>Earlier this morning,</i>
<i>a white powder-like</i>

23:50.490 --> 23:52.741
<i>- substance was found</i>
<i>in a package...</i>

23:52.742 --> 23:55.660
<i>...mailed to the office of</i>
<i>Majority Whip Jacqueline Sharp.</i>

23:55.661 --> 23:59.079
- Are we free to go?
- Almost, sir. Less than an hour.

23:59.080 --> 24:02.123
- I've got a message from your wife.
- - What is it?

24:02.124 --> 24:04.625
She's doing the
interview live, right now.

24:04.626 --> 24:08.795
<i>...Congressman Donald Blythe and 14 of Ms.
Sharp's staff.</i>

24:08.796 --> 24:13.507
<i>Mrs. Underwood, I so appreciate</i>
<i>you taking the time to speak with us today</i>

24:13.508 --> 24:17.510
<i>in what I am certain</i>
<i>is a very stressful situation.</i>

24:17.511 --> 24:21.263
<i>- Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>
<i>- Have you spoken with your husband today?</i>

24:21.264 --> 24:24.473
<i>Yes, I did,</i>
<i>and he's in very good spirits,</i>

24:24.474 --> 24:26.558
<i>and in good hands</i>
<i>with the Secret Service.</i>

24:26.559 --> 24:28.978
<i>Of course, he's very</i>
<i>disappointed he couldn't be here.</i>

24:28.979 --> 24:32.188
<i>Well, our thoughts are with him
and everyone else quarantined</i>

24:32.189 --> 24:34.023
<i>- at the Capitol today.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

24:34.024 --> 24:37.109
I'd like to begin
with Claire Underwood

24:37.110 --> 24:40.320
before you met your husband,
in Texas.

24:40.321 --> 24:43.155
- And I have a couple of pictures.
- Oh, no.

24:43.156 --> 24:45.073
Yes.

24:45.074 --> 24:48.408
Oh, my goodness.
That was Red.

24:48.409 --> 24:52.745
- An accomplished rider?
- An enthusiast.

24:52.746 --> 24:57.415
- This one's from a couple of years later.
- Oh, my goodness.

24:57.416 --> 25:00.294
You like those penny loafers?
Those are won...

25:00.295 --> 25:05.007
Those are two very different girls.
Which one are you more comfortable being?

25:06.799 --> 25:11.344
My family's ranch,
that was home for me.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.095
You didn't like the prep school?

25:13.096 --> 25:16.640
No, I think
I preferred the dirt.

25:19.392 --> 25:23.061
You grew up in Dallas,
though. Highland Park.

25:23.062 --> 25:27.772
Yes. My father, well, he was
a businessman, so we lived in the city.

25:27.773 --> 25:32.526
But we're ranchers. I mean,
we go back three generations, our family.

25:32.527 --> 25:35.238
Your parents were very wealthy.

25:35.239 --> 25:38.198
We were comfortable, yes.

25:38.199 --> 25:41.367
They made sure
I wanted for nothing.

25:41.368 --> 25:44.078
It was a very happy childhood.

25:44.079 --> 25:48.497
What is your most vivid
memory from that time?

25:48.498 --> 25:53.002
My most vivid memory?
Wow. Um...

25:55.880 --> 25:58.756
Probably, when I was
about nine or ten,

25:58.757 --> 26:03.467
my father took me to Dealey
Plaza where Kennedy was shot.

26:03.468 --> 26:06.720
And he said, "Claire,
a great man died here."

26:06.721 --> 26:11.057
And I remember not
fully comprehending

26:11.058 --> 26:13.392
the meaning of death yet.

26:13.393 --> 26:17.938
And I asked him how he died
and he told me.

26:17.939 --> 26:21.608
And I remember feeling so sad,
so angry.

26:22.609 --> 26:25.984
It seemed so unfair.

26:25.985 --> 26:31.031
I started to cry, and my daddy picked
me up and he wrapped his arms around me

26:31.032 --> 26:34.866
and he said,
"Don't be sad, sweetheart.

26:34.867 --> 26:40.289
He made the world a better place,
but sometimes that comes at a price."

26:42.416 --> 26:45.542
I guess that was
the most vivid memory.

27:01.470 --> 27:04.681
- We're only eight votes away.
- I'm sorry, I made up my mind.

27:04.682 --> 27:06.392
Me too. I gotta stick
to my guns on this one.

27:06.393 --> 27:09.269
You would rather
let the government shut down...

27:09.270 --> 27:11.895
Don't put that on us because
we're on the ass-end of the whip list.

27:11.896 --> 27:14.815
Don't get us wrong.
We have a lot of respect for you, Jackie.

27:14.816 --> 27:18.609
You're doing a fine job since Frank's gone.
Different styles, but a fine job.

27:18.610 --> 27:21.946
Excuse us just a moment.

27:21.947 --> 27:25.906
- They're not taking me seriously.
- Because you're not Frank.

27:25.907 --> 27:29.701
- You mean because I'm not a man.
- No, I mean Frank.

27:29.702 --> 27:33.121
They're used to being offered something.
Ask them what they want.

27:33.122 --> 27:34.956
Paul needs help with the
waste treatment facility.

27:34.957 --> 27:38.250
You're being just
as condescending as they are.

27:38.251 --> 27:43.212
Take some good advice when you get it.
I was right earlier, wasn't I?

27:47.842 --> 27:52.093
Paul, Remy tells me you
need a waste treatment plant.

27:52.094 --> 27:56.055
We've had some trouble
getting matching federal funds.

27:56.056 --> 28:00.058
Ben, you mentioned once
a winery museum in your district.

28:00.059 --> 28:02.352
We are making some
great wines in Long Island these days.

28:02.353 --> 28:06.022
I've tried some. It tastes like piss
compared to what we have in Napa.

28:06.023 --> 28:09.107
The sort of piss that belongs in Paul's
waste treatment plant.

28:09.108 --> 28:11.985
- Jackie...
- We have a possible terror attack,

28:11.986 --> 28:14.320
and you're holding out your
plates for more pork?

28:14.321 --> 28:16.488
You should be ashamed of
yourselves. In my caucus,

28:16.489 --> 28:21.701
people are rewarded for good behavior,
not trading their votes for ransom.

28:21.702 --> 28:24.203
When we walk in there,
I expect the both of you

28:24.204 --> 28:28.081
to vote yes without
a moment's hesitation.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.710
Thank you for your
change of heart.

28:33.835 --> 28:37.046
Six more to go.

28:37.047 --> 28:41.757
<i>You left Texas and spent the</i>
<i>last two years of high school</i>

28:41.758 --> 28:43.925
<i>at the prestigious</i>
<i>Phillips Academy.</i>

28:43.926 --> 28:48.305
- And then onto Radcliffe.
- Yes.

28:48.306 --> 28:50.639
Where you would meet
the future vice president.

28:50.640 --> 28:54.518
Back then,
just a dashing law student.

28:54.519 --> 28:57.811
I never dreamed he would become
vice president, of course.

28:57.812 --> 29:01.981
Some people think that your marriage may
be a bit more calculated than you let on.

29:01.982 --> 29:05.527
That perhaps he needed
your family's money.

29:05.528 --> 29:08.487
- No, that's just not true.
- Your father did contribute an awful lot

29:08.488 --> 29:12.240
- to his campaign. - Yes, he did,
because he believed in Francis.

29:12.241 --> 29:16.911
Would he have won that campaign had it
not been for your father's contributions?

29:16.912 --> 29:18.828
I don't know.
I mean, it certainly helped.

29:18.829 --> 29:21.247
But I like to think
that it was Francis's ideas

29:21.248 --> 29:24.917
and leadership that convinced
voters, not just TV commercials.

29:24.918 --> 29:28.460
- You've been married 27 years.
- That's right.

29:28.461 --> 29:31.671
You were just in school.
I mean, you married so young.

29:31.672 --> 29:35.841
We did, but when
you've found the one...

29:35.842 --> 29:38.718
Well, Francis was the one.

29:38.719 --> 29:43.932
- You call him Francis.
- Back home they call him Frank, still.

29:43.933 --> 29:46.016
But he likes
that I call him Francis.

29:46.017 --> 29:49.810
<i>He said that it makes him</i>
<i>sound more sophisticated.</i>

29:49.811 --> 29:55.566
- Is it hard being a politician's wife?
- It's thrilling.

29:55.567 --> 29:59.693
- Not without its challenges.
- Always in the background.

29:59.694 --> 30:03.113
Subsuming your goals
for his goals.

30:03.114 --> 30:05.197
Well, I don't see it that way.

30:05.198 --> 30:11.827
We're two very independent people
who have chosen to live our lives together.

30:11.828 --> 30:13.871
I support him.
He supports me.

30:13.872 --> 30:18.125
Which, you know, goes back
to the political partnership.

30:18.126 --> 30:22.919
My husband happens to be a politician.
And I happen to do political work.

30:22.920 --> 30:27.340
But our partnership
extends far beyond that.

30:29.175 --> 30:33.011
Children.
Was that a sacrifice?

30:33.012 --> 30:35.305
Because you haven't had any.

30:35.306 --> 30:38.932
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

30:38.933 --> 30:42.351
And we didn't feel that we could both do
that and be the parents we wanted to be.

30:42.352 --> 30:44.145
So we made the choice.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.606
- We've heard that answer before.
- Sorry?

30:47.607 --> 30:51.276
You have given the exact same
answer in previous interviews.

30:51.277 --> 30:53.444
Because it's the truth.

30:53.445 --> 30:58.239
Forgive me,
but career and timing,

30:58.240 --> 31:01.032
those are often
very convenient answers.

31:01.033 --> 31:04.660
It is true that whatever it takes
for people to get from "maybe" to "yes"

31:04.661 --> 31:08.498
- never arrived for me.
- Never felt the pressure?

31:08.499 --> 31:11.208
No... maternal instinct?

31:12.585 --> 31:15.295
- No.
- And it was a choice?

31:15.296 --> 31:17.754
It wasn't because
you couldn't have any?

31:17.755 --> 31:20.298
Francis and I did
what was right for us.

31:20.300 --> 31:23.925
Because it is unusual,
I mean, even now,

31:23.926 --> 31:29.472
for politicians at the
executive level not to have children.

31:29.473 --> 31:31.223
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

31:31.224 --> 31:34.850
<i>In your husband's</i>
<i>second congressional campaign,</i>

31:34.851 --> 31:37.894
<i>there was a Republican,</i>
<i>a pro-family candidate,</i>

31:37.896 --> 31:42.106
<i>who made some pretty</i>
<i>unsettling accusations.</i>

31:42.107 --> 31:45.942
<i>Well, Francis</i>
<i>is a Southern Democrat.</i>

31:45.943 --> 31:48.569
<i>We have thick skins.</i>

31:48.571 --> 31:53.115
<i>He suggested, in order to keep your
husband's political career on track...</i>

31:53.116 --> 31:56.868
<i>Children are the center</i>
<i>of many people's lives.</i>

31:56.869 --> 32:00.162
<i>And I think they just want to make sure
that their representatives will fight</i>

32:00.163 --> 32:05.458
<i>for their children's dreams. And Francis
has again and again proven that he will.</i>

32:05.459 --> 32:09.169
<i>And he will continue</i>
<i>to do so as vice president.</i>

32:09.170 --> 32:11.547
<i>He claimed that...</i>

32:11.548 --> 32:14.675
...you may have been pregnant
during the campaign.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.178
Was there a pregnancy?

32:22.055 --> 32:26.307
Have you ever been pregnant?

32:26.308 --> 32:29.436
- Break. Now.
- That's not gonna happen.

32:34.232 --> 32:35.567
Yes.

32:36.983 --> 32:41.571
- During the campaign?
- Before.

32:43.822 --> 32:48.242
- Was it a miscarriage?
- No.

32:48.243 --> 32:50.493
Did you...

32:50.494 --> 32:53.413
<i>Did you terminate the pregnancy?</i>

32:53.414 --> 32:56.788
If I said yes,

32:56.789 --> 33:01.668
my husband's political career
would be in jeopardy.

33:01.669 --> 33:06.881
My faith would be questioned.
Likely, my life would be threatened.

33:06.882 --> 33:12.262
But I won't feel ashamed. Yes, I was
pregnant. And, yes, I had an abortion.

33:15.723 --> 33:19.932
- Can you excuse me for one moment?
- Of course.

33:19.933 --> 33:24.354
<i>We'll have more of our live interview
with Claire Underwood in a moment.</i>

33:30.650 --> 33:32.817
That took a lot of guts.

33:36.113 --> 33:38.740
Yes, it did.

33:38.741 --> 33:42.408
No. It'll look like I am ashamed.
I'm not. And I won't.

33:42.409 --> 33:44.160
Nothing you can say
will make this any better.

33:44.161 --> 33:46.411
- I'd rather deal with...
- I'm not going to run from this.

33:46.412 --> 33:48.872
She's going to ask why
you had the abortion.

33:48.873 --> 33:50.624
I haven't had one.
I've had three.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.832
Three? No, you need
to stick to one.

33:52.833 --> 33:55.961
- OK. Fine.
- Tell me what you'll say.

33:55.962 --> 33:58.129
Well, I can't
use the real reason.

33:58.130 --> 34:00.339
The first two, I was a
teenager and I was reckless.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.424
What about the third?

34:02.425 --> 34:05.218
Well, the article that
she showed, it's right.

34:05.219 --> 34:07.803
I was on the pill, it didn't work.
We talked about having the baby,

34:07.804 --> 34:10.222
- and then we decided against it.
- Why?

34:10.223 --> 34:13.181
- Because we were focused on the campaign.
- How many weeks in?

34:13.183 --> 34:18.145
- Sixteen.
- You can't say any of this.

34:18.146 --> 34:19.812
Go upstairs.
I'll deal with Ashleigh.

34:19.813 --> 34:22.690
If we're going to continue,
we've got about 20 seconds.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.857
- Connor, I...
- Please trust me.

34:24.858 --> 34:26.612
You'll be making a big mistake.

34:33.991 --> 34:37.534
Are you willing
to discuss the circumstances...

34:37.536 --> 34:41.036
I became pregnant
as a result of a sexual assault.

34:41.036 --> 34:45.041
- Are you saying that you... you were...
- Raped.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.212
<i>You've never spoken publicly</i>
<i>about this before.</i>

34:51.213 --> 34:53.172
<i>No one ever asked.</i>

34:53.172 --> 34:56.299
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

34:56.300 --> 34:59.760
<i>It was college.</i>
<i>A classmate.</i>

34:59.761 --> 35:02.554
We were dating
and it happened on a...

35:02.555 --> 35:06.474
We had a fight,
and he forced himself on me.

35:06.475 --> 35:09.726
Did you tell anybody about it,
I mean, did he...?

35:09.727 --> 35:12.061
- Was he charged?
- No.

35:12.062 --> 35:15.356
Because at the time I felt that I was
somehow at fault. I knew I wasn't.

35:15.357 --> 35:18.275
But I just didn't
want to be stared at.

35:18.276 --> 35:21.736
I didn't want to be known
as the girl who got raped.

35:21.737 --> 35:26.574
And when I became pregnant,
I wasn't gonna drop out of school.

35:28.117 --> 35:31.202
I wasn't going to
let this man ruin my life.

35:31.203 --> 35:35.079
So I made a choice.
I ended it.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.290
But if you never told
anybody about it,

35:37.291 --> 35:39.666
the assailant could
still be out there.

35:39.668 --> 35:42.627
Can you tell us
anything about him?

35:42.628 --> 35:47.088
I saw him for the first time in
almost 30 years just a few months ago.

35:47.089 --> 35:49.550
<i>Where?</i>

35:49.551 --> 35:54.721
<i>At a commissioning</i>
<i>ceremony that Francis and I attended.</i>

35:54.722 --> 35:57.597
- Did you speak to him?
- Briefly.

35:57.598 --> 36:01.893
- Francis pinned stars on him.
- He was being commissioned?

36:04.312 --> 36:06.438
General Dalton McGinnis.

36:08.398 --> 36:11.983
And for the record, Francis
has always known about the assault,

36:11.984 --> 36:13.610
he just didn't know the name.

36:13.611 --> 36:19.113
And he's been nothing
but supportive all these years.

36:19.114 --> 36:23.284
We're gonna have
to reach out to the general...

36:23.285 --> 36:25.286
...for a response
to what you just said.

36:27.455 --> 36:29.873
Would you mind
if we took a quick break?

36:29.874 --> 36:32.041
Absolutely.

36:32.042 --> 36:36.837
We'll be right back with
Mrs. Claire Underwood.
Take all the time you need.

36:42.842 --> 36:45.093
The lab tests
all came back negative, sir.

36:45.094 --> 36:47.428
- What was it?
- Talcum powder laced with flour.

36:47.429 --> 36:50.222
It was pesticide from the wheat
that gave us the false positive.

36:50.223 --> 36:52.098
- So are we free to go?
- Yes, sir.

36:52.099 --> 36:54.391
- Nancy! Tell them I'm on my way down.
- I already did.

36:54.392 --> 36:56.894
- Mind if I use your phone?
- Of course.

36:56.895 --> 37:01.606
And Donald, I'm gonna get you that research
funding, no matter how the vote goes.

37:01.607 --> 37:03.941
It's your call, because I'm
still voting against it.

37:03.942 --> 37:08.236
- I understand.
- You have a brave wife, Frank.

37:08.237 --> 37:09.821
So do you, Donald.

37:13.741 --> 37:16.701
- Frank!
- How did you do?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.660
We're down four.
How about Blythe?

37:18.661 --> 37:20.453
- He won't budge.
- What did you offer him?

37:20.454 --> 37:22.413
Alzheimer's research.
He was insulted.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.748
- The vote's in 45 minutes.
- I need to get to Claire.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.250
- Who should I call from the car?
- We have exhausted our options.

37:27.251 --> 37:29.085
It's Blythe's people
or it won't pass.

37:29.086 --> 37:31.962
- They're too loyal to him.
- Hey, go. I'll figure it out.

37:31.963 --> 37:35.758
- I can stay if you need me. - No, get to
your wife. I know where to find you.

37:37.968 --> 37:40.594
Nancy! I need every
ream of paper you have!

37:40.595 --> 37:42.972
And get me dollies!

37:58.024 --> 38:01.194
Almost done.
Twenty more minutes.

38:02.529 --> 38:04.738
I hate lying.

38:04.739 --> 38:06.448
- Did he do it?
- Yes.

38:06.449 --> 38:10.784
- Then don't feel bad.
- What if he denies it?

38:10.785 --> 38:13.662
Then we'll cross that bridge.

38:13.663 --> 38:15.788
- Connor?
- Give us one more minute.

38:15.789 --> 38:17.998
We have a young woman
on the phone, a private.

38:17.999 --> 38:22.209
She says she was also assaulted
by the general. Two years ago.

38:22.210 --> 38:24.879
She wants to share her story,
but she won't give her name.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.590
We can't put her on
if she's anonymous.

38:29.090 --> 38:33.302
- You want me to convince her?
- She's frightened.

38:33.303 --> 38:35.596
Is she still on the phone?

38:37.264 --> 38:39.682
<i>I've never told anyone.</i>

38:39.683 --> 38:45.270
It took me almost half my life
before I could say anything.

38:45.271 --> 38:48.439
But you can say something now.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.440
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:50.441 --> 38:53.735
Just think of how many
others there must have been.

38:53.736 --> 38:55.569
<i>But you want me to talk.</i>

38:55.570 --> 38:58.655
Well, would you have called
if you didn't want to?

38:58.656 --> 39:01.239
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>I'd have to use my name.</i>

39:01.240 --> 39:04.910
Listen, I understand
you're afraid of the consequence.

39:04.911 --> 39:07.495
<i>I'm a private. He's a general.</i>

39:07.496 --> 39:10.956
And my husband is the vice
president of the United States.

39:10.957 --> 39:15.169
We will protect you.
I promise you that.

39:18.046 --> 39:20.088
What's your name?

39:22.884 --> 39:25.719
<i>Private Megan Hennessey.</i>

39:31.264 --> 39:35.767
- What is this?
- The names of every person in America

39:35.768 --> 39:38.143
who will lose home care
when the freeze sets in.

39:38.144 --> 39:41.230
Who will lose half
their welfare benefits.

39:41.231 --> 39:43.147
Who will go on furlough.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.234
Who will lose their student
loans, transportation services,

39:46.235 --> 39:49.486
post-combat counseling.
Shall I go on?

39:49.487 --> 39:51.488
This is about the big picture,
Jacqueline.

39:51.489 --> 39:54.992
This picture looks
pretty big to me.

39:57.244 --> 39:59.954
I can't vote for the package.

40:02.373 --> 40:03.998
Then don't.

40:03.999 --> 40:06.083
Just get four
of your people to do it.

40:06.084 --> 40:10.086
And then, work with me
after we avoid the freeze.

40:10.087 --> 40:13.380
I'm not Frank Underwood.

40:13.381 --> 40:18.676
<i>At least two</i>
<i>other girls that same year.</i>

40:18.677 --> 40:22.429
<i>If that was true for all</i>
<i>the years he's served...</i>

40:22.430 --> 40:26.473
- It's just staggering.
- <i> And I've felt so helpless.</i>

40:26.474 --> 40:31.561
<i>And he keeps rising in the</i>
<i>ranks. The system protects him.</i>

40:31.562 --> 40:35.522
Why do you think
no one has ever reported him?

40:35.523 --> 40:37.440
Do you want to join her?

40:37.442 --> 40:39.234
<i>- We know it won't do anything.
</i> - No.

40:39.235 --> 40:40.902
<i>Chain of command.</i>

40:40.903 --> 40:42.736
It's inexcusable
that you're willing

40:42.737 --> 40:45.154
to put your life on the line
to defend our freedom,

40:45.155 --> 40:47.865
and yet you don't feel the
freedom to come forward.

40:47.866 --> 40:52.786
<i>I love my country,</i>
<i>and I love serving in the Marines.</i>

40:52.787 --> 40:54.871
<i>But not like this.</i>

40:54.872 --> 40:57.497
<i>Private Hennessey,</i>
<i>thank you for your courage</i>

40:57.498 --> 40:59.791
<i>in joining us tonight.</i>

40:59.792 --> 41:03.127
<i>It was Mrs. Underwood</i>
<i>who gave me the courage.</i>

41:03.128 --> 41:06.588
<i>Mrs. Underwood,</i>
<i>thank you for your honesty.</i>

41:06.589 --> 41:08.423
Sir, your wife is on the phone.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.925
<i>You've given us</i>
<i>a great deal to think about.</i>

41:10.926 --> 41:12.675
<i>Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>

41:12.676 --> 41:15.971
And that concludes our live
one-on-one exclusive interview

41:15.972 --> 41:19.849
with Claire Underwood. You can watch
the entire interview on our website.

41:19.850 --> 41:22.266
And as always, we invite you
to give us your thoughts

41:22.267 --> 41:24.518
and your comments
on Facebook and on Twitter.

41:24.519 --> 41:27.563
But for now, thanks for watching
and good night.

41:27.564 --> 41:29.941
And we're out.

41:32.525 --> 41:37.362
This is going to make waves
like you never imagined.

41:38.823 --> 41:40.574
Thank you.

42:08.595 --> 42:13.264
- Where's Carter?
- You'll be reporting to me now.

42:13.265 --> 42:17.352
- And who are you?
- Carter's boss.

42:17.353 --> 42:20.855
You're doing good work, Gavin.
But you can't be assaulting the target.

42:20.856 --> 42:23.272
That could compromise us.

42:23.273 --> 42:25.607
I don't even know why you're
going after this guy. He's small-time.

42:25.608 --> 42:28.652
- That's not your concern. - He couldn't
write a line of code to save his life.

42:28.653 --> 42:31.445
He intends to commit an act
of cyberterrorism.

42:31.446 --> 42:34.490
Well, that's intention, not capability.
He's not a real threat.

42:34.491 --> 42:37.826
Maybe Carter
talked things out with you.

42:37.827 --> 42:39.162
I won't.

42:44.165 --> 42:46.666
- How much longer?
- Until what?

42:46.667 --> 42:50.378
- Until I can stop.
- You prefer prison?

42:50.379 --> 42:54.047
I've given you eight child
pornographers, three botnet masters.

42:54.048 --> 42:56.049
But you still haven't
given us AVunit.

42:56.050 --> 42:59.425
I told Carter I don't
know where he is.

42:59.426 --> 43:03.179
- Yes, you do.
- I don't. Nobody does.

43:03.180 --> 43:06.224
Then what about your
friends in Dec Sec?

43:11.562 --> 43:14.437
I'm not giving you my friends.

43:14.438 --> 43:16.982
Then you can keep doing this.

43:16.983 --> 43:19.150
You're a productive asset,
Gavin.

43:19.151 --> 43:22.443
But the moment you stop
being productive,

43:22.444 --> 43:24.279
no lawyer can help you.

43:46.714 --> 43:49.966
I wish we had the
real thing right now.

44:04.977 --> 44:08.940
- Always prepared.
- Francis.

44:20.157 --> 44:25.076
- I've missed this.
- So have I.

44:25.077 --> 44:27.411
Shouldn't you be on the phone
getting your accolades?

44:27.412 --> 44:30.081
They can wait till tomorrow.

44:33.626 --> 44:35.834
Sing me something.

44:35.835 --> 44:38.670
- What do you want to hear?
- Anything.
