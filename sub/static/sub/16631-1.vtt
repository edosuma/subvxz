- [Woman]:
Shut the line! Shut the line!

38:42.100 --> 38:43.749
[Screaming]

38:43.790 --> 38:44.745
[Alarm blaring]

38:44.800 --> 38:46.529
- [Man]:
Shut the line!

38:46.580 --> 38:47.831
Shut the goddamn line!

38:49.060 --> 38:51.016
- Oh my God!
Get the medic.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.319
[Sighing]

39:13.170 --> 39:16.867
Sheila, tell me
they'll fix her.

39:16.910 --> 39:19.822
- They'll reattach the
scalp, what's left of it,

39:19.870 --> 39:22.782
then once the rest
scabs over, a Wig.

39:22.830 --> 39:26.391
- Can't they do some
kind of graft?

39:26.450 --> 39:28.532
-_ It_ won't be_a
priority operation.

39:32.970 --> 39:36.667
- Doctor, regarding
Vera Burr's treatment...

39:36.720 --> 39:38.142
- We'll do the best we can.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.327
- My daughter told me
this hospital

39:40.370 --> 39:42.326
is a leader in skin--
What is it?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.940
- Plastic surgery.
But, ma'am--

39:44.990 --> 39:46.719
- Yes, you'll do that
surgery on Vera?

39:46.770 --> 39:48.590
- We have countless
pressmg needs.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.985
- You--you can't let her
leave here deformed.

39:52.040 --> 39:54.861
It--it will destroy
her future.

39:54.910 --> 39:56.559
- With limited resources,

39:56.610 --> 39:58.566
priority must be given
to the soldiers.

39:58.610 --> 39:59.599
- Vera is a soldier.

39:59.650 --> 40:00.821
- Mother,
please don't--

40:00.870 --> 40:02.519
- Vera risked
her life every day

40:02.570 --> 40:04.049
to help win this war.

40:04.090 --> 40:05.523
Do not turn
your back on her.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.299
If you want
to see our boys

40:07.360 --> 40:09.783
with bullets in their guns
and bombs in their planes,

40:09.840 --> 40:11.705
you will show her
the s-same respect.

40:13.490 --> 40:16.926
Now, you go in there,
you book the operating room,

40:16.970 --> 40:18.619
and you do
the surgeries,

40:18.670 --> 40:21.013
no matter how
expen5ive or lengthy.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.493
You do your best
for that girl.

40:32.860 --> 40:35.818
- Poor Vera,
to live like that,

40:35.860 --> 40:37.816
disfigured for
the rest of your years.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.679
Terrible.

40:39.740 --> 40:42.254
- Seems you've faced
some of that yourself.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.950
Those bruises,
the scars on your back.

40:51.270 --> 40:54.489
Kate, what happened?

40:54.530 --> 40:56.179
- That's none of
your busmess.

40:57.450 --> 41:00.010
- Hey, whatever
you're running from,

41:00.060 --> 41:01.539
you're safe here now.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.757
I'll make sure.

41:10.810 --> 41:13.028
[Door opening]

41:19.040 --> 41:21.122
[Crickets chirping]

41:24.690 --> 41:26.169
-K3a
damned disgrace!

41:26.220 --> 41:27.778
- What is?
What have you heard?

41:27.830 --> 41:29.991
- What, you can't guess?
Carol told me

41:30.050 --> 41:32.917
about the funhouse disaster.
- The accident.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.485
- I don't give a damn
about the accident!

41:35.530 --> 41:38.795
It's you signing up to be the
next bomb girl blown to bits.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.569
- Vera Burr had her
scalp torn off.

41:40.620 --> 41:42.349
It's not a joke.

41:42.410 --> 41:44.537
- Laugh or cry, you're
not working the floor.

41:44.580 --> 41:46.457
You're in the office.
That was the deal.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.195
- I wanna do more.
When I think about

41:48.240 --> 41:50.413
what thousands of soldiers
do on our behalf--

41:50.460 --> 41:52.416
- Enough with the
damned soldiers!

41:52.460 --> 41:54.542
All their uniforms
and badges and kit-bags.

41:54.590 --> 41:56.239
He's just someone
to hang things on.

41:56.290 --> 41:57.985
He doesn't fight
because he wants to.

41:58.030 --> 41:59.634
He fights because he
needs the job,

41:59.690 --> 42:01.590
and he doesn't know
a better way to Win.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.460
This family, your
father and I, we do.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.420
- What am I
supposed to do?

42:05.470 --> 42:09.031
Just sit back while
the rest of the world fights?

42:09.090 --> 42:11.217
- They don't need you.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.251
- Today a woman's
life was ripped away.

42:13.310 --> 42:15.619
And maybe I'm crazy to want
to step in her shoes,

42:15.660 --> 42:18.049
but I've seen more these
past days, I've done more.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.704
I've never felt so alive.

42:19.750 --> 42:22.708
I won't go back to just drifting
around this house all day.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.149
I'm going to
work the floor.

42:24.190 --> 42:25.487
- Your father
will kill you.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.019
- So we never tell him.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.328
- Why do you
want to do this?

42:31.590 --> 42:34.366
- To see what
I'm capable of.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.502
- Well, it won't
go on forever.

42:36.550 --> 42:39.986
This war will end and
we'll all go back to normal.

42:40.030 --> 42:41.816
- So let's just
live for now.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.128
- Come on.

42:51.780 --> 42:56.433
Life is such
a great adventure

42:56.480 --> 43:00.610
Learn to live it as you go

43:02.660 --> 43:07.188
No one in the world
can censure

43:07.230 --> 43:11.052
What we do here below

43:12.540 --> 43:15.407
Don't save your kisses

43:15.460 --> 43:17.678
Just pass them round

43:17.720 --> 43:19.847
- Go get 'em.

43:19.900 --> 43:23.119
You'll find my reason
is logically sound

43:23.160 --> 43:27.688
Who's gonna know
that you pass them around

43:27.730 --> 43:32.599
A hundred years from today?

43:32.650 --> 43:37.861
A hundred years from today

43:47.100 --> 43:49.614
So laugh and sing

43:49.670 --> 43:52.230
Make love the thing

43:52.280 --> 43:56.102
Be happy while you may

43:57.460 --> 43:59.974
There's always one

44:00.020 --> 44:02.580
Beneath the sun

44:02.640 --> 44:07.805
Who's bound to make
you feel that way
