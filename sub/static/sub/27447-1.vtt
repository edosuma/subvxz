[girl]
<i>The ancient Greeks told a tale</i>

01:45.211 --> 01:48.045
<i>of a winged white stallion
named Pegasus.</i>

01:48.047 --> 01:51.349
<i>Mighty and majestic like no
other on Elysium or Earth,</i>

01:51.351 --> 01:55.723
<i>Pegasus had two wondrous wings
that made him lord of the skie.</i>

01:56.922 --> 01:59.724
<i>Wherever Pegasus
would stride upon the earth,</i>

01:59.726 --> 02:02.093
<i>springs would appear,
bringing with them</i>

02:02.095 --> 02:03.927
<i>flowers,
plants and fruits</i>

02:03.929 --> 02:06.032
<i>that fed on
the nourishing waters.</i>

02:06.800 --> 02:08.400
<i>One day, Zeus told Pegasus</i>

02:08.401 --> 02:10.905
<i>he would bestow upon him
a great gift.</i>

02:11.704 --> 02:13.271
<i>Pegasus stood patiently,</i>

02:13.273 --> 02:15.710
<i>staring at the waters
as the offering arrived.</i>

02:16.143 --> 02:20.077
<i>And so, Pegasus,
lord of the skies,</i>

02:20.079 --> 02:24.214
<i>flew into the heavens to soar
among the clouds and the stars</i>

02:24.216 --> 02:26.620
with his daughter for all time.

02:27.753 --> 02:29.055
Pretty cool, huh?

02:29.955 --> 02:33.424
I guess. Only if you're into
horses and stuff.

02:33.426 --> 02:36.030
It's way more
than just horses and stuff.

02:36.329 --> 02:38.362
Anyway, I think
it's pretty cool.

02:38.364 --> 02:41.700
[thunder rumbles]

02:41.702 --> 02:45.003
It's going to storm all summer.
I just know it.

02:45.005 --> 02:49.143
Don't be silly, Jonathan.
It's just a storm. No big deal.

02:49.442 --> 02:51.411
It'll be gone
by the time you wake up.

02:56.049 --> 02:57.251
[Jonathan] Sydney?

02:58.018 --> 02:58.919
Yeah?

02:59.251 --> 03:01.052
I don't wanna move.

03:01.054 --> 03:03.890
I don't wanna leave
the house or the ranch.

03:04.223 --> 03:06.060
I thought you didn't
like horses.

03:06.393 --> 03:08.863
I don't, but I like it here.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.200
[sighs]

03:15.168 --> 03:17.438
Everything's gonna be
all right, Jonathan.

03:19.339 --> 03:20.740
Okay?

03:26.513 --> 03:27.748
Good night.

03:31.084 --> 03:32.086
[switch clicks]

03:33.286 --> 03:37.091
- [thunder rumbling]
- [insects chirping]

03:46.299 --> 03:49.437
[laughing] That's so funny!

03:51.170 --> 03:53.303
[thunder roars]

03:53.305 --> 03:55.942
[rain pattering]

04:24.003 --> 04:25.071
What is that?

04:26.972 --> 04:30.176
- [buzzing]
- [bubbling]

04:34.446 --> 04:36.116
I don't need this. [grunts]

04:39.219 --> 04:41.422
[thunder rumbling]

04:50.362 --> 04:52.365
[man] I just can't.
Please don't ask me again.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.835
- [woman] You have to let it go.
- No, I can't. Not yet.

04:56.302 --> 04:58.436
We are doing our best.

04:58.438 --> 05:01.105
It is time to put what's best
for our family...

05:01.107 --> 05:03.508
We are working
80-hour work weeks.

05:03.510 --> 05:06.280
Okay? We deserve better
than all this debt.

05:09.381 --> 05:12.617
We could sell the ranch
and start over.

05:12.619 --> 05:14.619
We could move on.

05:14.621 --> 05:18.122
Melanie, this ranch has been
in my family for over 60 years.

05:18.124 --> 05:19.857
I can't just walk away from it.

05:19.859 --> 05:22.496
You may have lost all hope.
I haven't.

05:30.369 --> 05:31.437
[sighs]

05:40.379 --> 05:43.416
[rain pattering]

05:48.054 --> 05:49.319
[thinking]
<i>God...</i>

05:49.321 --> 05:52.256
- [sobs]
- [thunder rumbles]

05:52.258 --> 05:54.294
<i>Please help us
through these hard times.</i>

05:55.628 --> 05:57.263
<i>Keep my family together.</i>

05:59.198 --> 06:00.867
<i>That's all I really want.</i>

06:01.902 --> 06:04.071
<i>For me and my little brother.</i>

06:19.953 --> 06:22.121
[birds chirping]

06:41.140 --> 06:43.576
Hey, little man.
Why the long face?

06:44.244 --> 06:46.446
- No reason.
- No reason?

06:47.513 --> 06:49.080
Is there somewhere
you'd like to go?

06:49.082 --> 06:51.051
Can you drive me
to Simon's house?

06:51.417 --> 06:53.186
You bet. Hop in.

06:59.258 --> 07:00.360
Put your seat belt on.

07:15.140 --> 07:18.479
Oh, look. Someone moved into
the old Johnson place.

07:39.064 --> 07:40.066
[horse snorts]

07:41.768 --> 07:43.070
Hey, buddy.

07:51.311 --> 07:52.947
[snorts, grunts]

07:55.648 --> 07:57.350
Can I give you a scratch?

07:58.717 --> 07:59.953
Come on.

08:01.621 --> 08:03.121
[grunts, snorts]

08:03.123 --> 08:04.458
Come on, J.R.

08:05.391 --> 08:08.161
- You need to eat, boy.
- [snorts]

08:09.328 --> 08:11.631
The vet says
there's nothing wrong with you.

08:12.599 --> 08:14.501
[grunts]

08:17.237 --> 08:19.439
[grunting]

08:30.516 --> 08:34.083
[hammering]

08:34.086 --> 08:35.121
[J.R. snorts]

09:06.152 --> 09:07.054
[sighs]

09:50.864 --> 09:52.331
[boy] That's a pretty
horse you got there.

09:52.632 --> 09:56.166
Thanks. He's not feeling
too hot, unfortunately.

09:56.168 --> 09:57.503
Sorry to hear that.

09:58.204 --> 09:59.773
- What's his name?
- J.R.

10:01.141 --> 10:02.409
What's got him down?

10:03.243 --> 10:06.513
No one knows for sure.
He's just depressed, I think.

10:06.879 --> 10:10.348
And don't tell me horses don't get
depressed, 'cause I know they do.

10:10.350 --> 10:13.686
No, no, you're right.
They have feelings, same as us.

10:16.355 --> 10:19.223
I'm, um...
I'm Peter, by the way.

10:19.225 --> 10:20.690
We just moved into the house
down the street.

10:20.692 --> 10:21.727
[chuckles]

10:23.595 --> 10:24.630
And you are?

10:25.230 --> 10:26.332
Oh, Sydney.

10:26.566 --> 10:28.335
Ah. Nice to meet you,
Sydney.

10:32.571 --> 10:35.708
So, uh, how's school
around here?

10:36.341 --> 10:38.843
Same as everything else.
Dull.

10:38.845 --> 10:41.913
- Can't be all that bad.
- Yeah? Well, you'll see.

10:41.915 --> 10:44.649
[chuckles] No wonder
your horse is depressed.

10:44.651 --> 10:45.819
[Sydney chuckles]

10:46.920 --> 10:48.019
Anyways, I was driving
my mom nuts, so she told me

10:48.021 --> 10:50.320
I ought to come down here
and take a look around.

10:50.322 --> 10:53.559
You know, see if you guys
had a summer job or something.

10:54.793 --> 10:57.295
I have always
wanted to be a vet.

10:57.297 --> 10:59.566
I love animals,
especially horses.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.137
My dad can't afford
to hire anyone right now.

11:04.704 --> 11:08.242
Um, I can help out wherever I'm needed.
I don't have to be paid.

11:08.774 --> 11:11.208
Or...
[chuckles]

11:11.210 --> 11:12.712
- Maybe. [chuckles]
- Okay.

11:16.749 --> 11:17.850
Would you look at that?

11:22.455 --> 11:23.853
- [Peter exclaims]
- [J.R. huffs]

11:23.855 --> 11:25.589
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- [Sydney] Whoa.

11:25.591 --> 11:28.325
- [Peter chuckles]
- [Sydney] Whoa, J.R. Whoa.

11:28.327 --> 11:30.363
[Peter]
Whoa. Hey, hey.

11:32.231 --> 11:33.666
Something's
making him nervous.

11:34.867 --> 11:38.435
Pretty. What kind of bird
do you think it belongs to?

11:38.437 --> 11:40.473
I don't know.
There's another one.

11:41.874 --> 11:44.742
Poor little thing,
whatever it was.

11:44.744 --> 11:46.613
I don't know how little
this thing was.

11:48.181 --> 11:50.751
Look at that. I don't think I've ever seen
a feather that big or that white ever.

11:53.485 --> 11:55.888
- Whoa.
- Did one of your horses get hurt?

11:56.623 --> 11:57.791
No way.

11:59.425 --> 12:00.757
Sounds like one
got away.

12:00.759 --> 12:02.528
[exhales] Hold on.

12:12.705 --> 12:13.806
Hey.

12:14.974 --> 12:15.975
What do you
make of this?

12:17.143 --> 12:19.709
You think a goose got
knocked around in the storm?

12:19.711 --> 12:22.313
- That'd have to be one big goose.
- Yeah.

12:22.315 --> 12:23.749
I guess you're right.
[sighs]

12:25.417 --> 12:27.453
You look like
you could use some lemonade.

12:28.654 --> 12:30.423
You always know
how to cheer me up.

12:30.723 --> 12:34.058
Well, not much an ice cold
glass of lemonade can't fix.

12:34.060 --> 12:38.265
Oh... [sighs]
If only that were true.

12:40.932 --> 12:43.236
But I do feel better.
Thank you.

12:44.003 --> 12:46.672
Oh. Look what I found.

12:49.676 --> 12:50.911
[man] Oh, my. I...

12:51.744 --> 12:54.411
I haven't seen these
since I was a little kid.

12:54.413 --> 12:56.514
I found them when I was
cleaning out the basement.

12:56.516 --> 12:59.049
Thought it might be nice
to let them out for some air.

12:59.051 --> 13:01.017
- That's Grandpa William, right?
- Mm-hmm.

13:01.019 --> 13:02.819
With Grandma Molly. [sniffs]

13:02.821 --> 13:05.758
Willy built the ranch,
named it after her.

13:06.825 --> 13:09.296
Those two
loved each other so much.

13:10.595 --> 13:13.933
- Molly's Ranch used to really be something, huh?
- Mmm.

13:15.067 --> 13:19.005
The horses we raised
were the most beautiful around.

13:19.806 --> 13:22.008
Breeders and riders
came from all over.

13:22.908 --> 13:24.076
And the Hollywood folk
loved it, too.

13:24.844 --> 13:26.946
I was just a little girl then,
so I don't remember much, but...

13:28.047 --> 13:32.518
Oh, my mother used to tell the
most exciting bedtime stories.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.691
Dad would be really ashamed of
what I let happen to this place.

13:39.091 --> 13:39.960
No.

13:40.926 --> 13:43.964
Your father was very proud
of you, Joshua.

13:44.931 --> 13:46.566
He's proud of you now.

13:47.667 --> 13:51.370
You're a wonderful teacher,
a loving father.

13:52.839 --> 13:54.708
What happened around here
is not your fault.

13:55.641 --> 13:57.974
And it's not gonna be the end
of Molly's Ranch either.

13:57.976 --> 14:00.578
So, you just shoo
those unpleasant thoughts

14:00.580 --> 14:02.349
right out of your head,
young man.

14:03.383 --> 14:04.917
Okay. I'll try.

14:05.484 --> 14:06.919
Oh. [chuckles]

14:08.488 --> 14:10.691
Maybe this'll bring us
some luck.

14:31.710 --> 14:33.379
- Whoa, whoa.
- [whinnying]

14:35.782 --> 14:36.983
Whoa, J.R., whoa.

14:44.489 --> 14:47.661
Do you have any idea how many more
clients you'd get if you had a website?

14:48.094 --> 14:49.796
Why would I need
more clients?

14:50.162 --> 14:51.828
To make more money.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.197
I don't need more money.

14:53.199 --> 14:55.635
[chuckles] Uncle Nate,

14:56.134 --> 14:59.102
I could design you the most amazing
website that you've ever seen.

14:59.104 --> 15:01.171
I have no doubt.

15:01.173 --> 15:02.808
I'll give you a good price.

15:03.508 --> 15:05.443
Look, Alan,
if you need more money,

15:05.445 --> 15:07.748
why don't you wake up at 5:00,
and come work for me.

15:08.047 --> 15:10.580
- I don't need more money.
- Neither do I.

15:10.582 --> 15:13.586
- I'm just saying, it's...
- No, that settles it.

15:25.998 --> 15:28.568
- Hi, Mr. Craft.
- Hey, Jonathan.

15:31.037 --> 15:34.972
Lord, what I wouldn't give
to be you this fine summer day.

15:34.974 --> 15:38.809
- Why's that?
- Ain't this just about the greatest day ever created?

15:38.811 --> 15:40.913
The first day
of summer vacation.

15:41.547 --> 15:43.881
I'm too old to care
about summer anymore.

15:43.883 --> 15:46.483
Now, don't you go
growing out of summer just yet.

15:46.485 --> 15:48.654
There's plenty of time
for that later on.

15:49.088 --> 15:51.789
Keep the magic
in your eyes, Jonathan.

15:51.791 --> 15:54.895
There's no such thing
as magic, Mr. Craft.

15:59.798 --> 16:02.699
This is gonna be
my masterpiece.

16:02.701 --> 16:04.702
Nothing you build
ever works.

16:04.704 --> 16:07.737
What about that stupid
rocket ship last summer?

16:07.739 --> 16:08.642
That...

16:09.008 --> 16:10.543
wasn't my fault.

16:10.843 --> 16:13.209
You almost burned
your house down.

16:13.211 --> 16:15.011
That rocket ship
would've worked

16:15.013 --> 16:17.580
if my stupid sister
didn't get in the way.

16:17.582 --> 16:19.518
Nearly killed her cat.

16:19.985 --> 16:22.922
With great achievement
comes great sacrifice.

16:23.689 --> 16:26.026
Someday they'll finally regret
how they held me back.

16:26.658 --> 16:28.592
What about inventing something

16:28.594 --> 16:31.665
that will prevent my dad
from selling the house?

16:32.665 --> 16:35.469
- Hmm.
- [footsteps approaching]

16:37.736 --> 16:38.637
[gasps]

16:40.540 --> 16:43.841
Hey, Alyssa, I'm building
a scooter this year. For real.

16:43.843 --> 16:46.577
We may even go into the city
to buy comic books.

16:46.579 --> 16:49.683
We'll be cruising around
all summer long, in style.

16:50.148 --> 16:52.051
Heck, I may even
let you ride it.

16:52.685 --> 16:54.551
I'm gonna be
the owner of NASA someday,

16:54.553 --> 16:55.953
and I'm gonna be
the first person ever

16:55.955 --> 16:58.124
to put a comic book store
on Mars.

16:59.258 --> 17:03.128
Mmm! You're a gross,
little worm, Simon.

17:06.299 --> 17:09.069
I don't get girls.
They don't have any foresight.

17:09.702 --> 17:11.068
What's foresight?

17:11.069 --> 17:11.972
I don't know.

17:12.771 --> 17:13.671
I hear Mom saying it
all the time...

17:13.673 --> 17:17.143
to Dad. He doesn't
have any of it.

17:19.109 --> 17:21.743
- Did he find a job yet?
- Yeah.

17:21.746 --> 17:23.115
He's working
at the construction site.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.950
But someday,
he won't need a job.

17:25.952 --> 17:27.988
I'm gonna get
this whole family rich.

17:29.088 --> 17:30.557
Yeah, sure.

17:31.590 --> 17:32.725
Just wait and see, buddy.

17:33.792 --> 17:36.029
Once it happens, the world
won't know what hit it.

17:44.837 --> 17:45.872
Come on, boy.

17:50.275 --> 17:51.176
Good boy.

17:59.952 --> 18:02.185
- [Peter] Syd, is that one of yours?
- [snorts]

18:02.187 --> 18:03.889
[Sydney]
Most definitely not.

18:25.645 --> 18:26.346
Hey.

18:27.847 --> 18:29.349
Those aren't
what I think they are...

18:30.315 --> 18:31.248
are they?

18:31.250 --> 18:33.117
[whinnying]

18:33.119 --> 18:34.888
[Peter] I think
it's got a broken wing.

18:37.389 --> 18:38.291
Wait a minute.

18:39.190 --> 18:41.026
Are you more surprised
that it's got a wing

18:41.394 --> 18:42.963
or that it's got
a broken wing?

18:43.396 --> 18:45.764
'Cause last time I checked,

18:46.197 --> 18:48.033
horses don't have wings.

18:49.769 --> 18:50.670
This one does.

18:53.705 --> 18:55.074
[Sydney]
Where did it come from?

18:56.042 --> 18:57.010
[Peter] I don't know.

19:01.414 --> 19:03.280
[whinnying]

19:03.282 --> 19:05.315
[Sydney] This has gotta
be some kind of joke.

19:05.317 --> 19:09.189
Someone's idea of a hoax
or a prank or something.

19:10.388 --> 19:11.625
It's just gotta be.

19:12.425 --> 19:14.226
[Peter]
Look, it's real.

19:15.093 --> 19:16.196
Those are real.

19:17.396 --> 19:18.398
What are you?

19:19.965 --> 19:21.699
Are you a Pegasus?

19:21.701 --> 19:23.299
- [whinnies]
- [Peter] What's Pegasus?

19:23.301 --> 19:25.338
An ancient creature
from Greek myth.

19:27.939 --> 19:31.143
I doubt it flew here
all the way from Greece.

19:32.110 --> 19:33.679
It doesn't look
all that ancient.

19:35.347 --> 19:37.716
So, what are we gonna do?

19:40.485 --> 19:41.687
I don't know, but...

19:42.789 --> 19:44.257
we can't leave her here
for the grown-ups to find her.

19:44.889 --> 19:46.059
[Sydney]
What do you mean?

19:47.159 --> 19:48.861
[Peter] They might sell
her to a circus or...

19:50.329 --> 19:52.396
- something worse.
- Worse?

19:52.398 --> 19:55.201
[Peter] Might take it to a lab and
do experiments on it or something.

19:57.002 --> 19:57.936
There's a shed.

19:58.337 --> 19:59.906
We haven't used it in years.

20:00.272 --> 20:03.042
That sounds good, but can
you get it to follow you?

20:03.743 --> 20:04.677
I don't know.

20:05.077 --> 20:08.348
Good girl. Or "it."

20:46.185 --> 20:47.483
Mr. Warren.

20:47.485 --> 20:49.219
Boy, it always
makes my day brighter

20:49.221 --> 20:51.057
to hear my name called
by a beautiful woman.

20:51.857 --> 20:53.223
I'm Melanie Killian.

20:53.225 --> 20:55.125
My husband and I
own Molly's Ranch.

20:55.127 --> 20:56.763
Well, it's nice
to finally meet you.

20:57.128 --> 20:59.799
I don't mind admitting
you've cost me a lot of sleep.

21:00.832 --> 21:04.534
Yeah, sorry about that. Your offer
on our property was very generous,

21:04.536 --> 21:05.537
um, Mr. Warren, but...

21:06.871 --> 21:09.441
- My husband and I...
- I understand your concerns.

21:10.109 --> 21:12.242
I haven't told you my
concerns yet, Mr. Warren.

21:12.244 --> 21:16.146
Call me Dan, and I know I dress like
I belong in a Manhattan penthouse,

21:16.148 --> 21:19.116
but trust me, my roots are
right here in the heartland.

21:19.118 --> 21:21.221
Yeah, I grew up
working this soil.

21:21.821 --> 21:23.790
Sweating under
the hot country sun.

21:24.322 --> 21:26.522
You know, I wear Armani,
but my soul

21:26.524 --> 21:29.963
is 100% small town America,
Mrs. Killian.

21:30.929 --> 21:33.799
And you call this
small town America?

21:34.567 --> 21:36.169
Come here.
Let me show you something.

21:38.536 --> 21:39.905
Please don't.

21:41.907 --> 21:45.211
You know, like it or not, small-town
America isn't much of a business model.

21:45.610 --> 21:47.280
It's an outdated concept.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.816
If towns don't evolve,

21:50.115 --> 21:51.984
they get swallowed up
by bigger fish.

21:53.185 --> 21:56.356
And what I've done here is just the
beginning of my plans for your town.

21:57.255 --> 21:58.123
You know?

21:59.425 --> 22:01.558
I'm gonna give your town a fighting
chance, is what I'm gonna do,

22:01.560 --> 22:04.998
and I promise, each and every
one of you is gonna thank me.

22:05.496 --> 22:08.632
On the other side of those woods
is your ranch.

22:08.634 --> 22:10.434
And that's where
I'm gonna build restaurants

22:10.436 --> 22:12.435
and casinos
and movie theaters.

22:12.437 --> 22:15.105
Can you imagine
what an amusement park

22:15.107 --> 22:17.443
would do to that dusty strip
over there?

22:18.474 --> 22:19.512
It would become a mecca
for tourists.

22:20.411 --> 22:24.016
But there's one little thing
holding me back.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.953
Our 100 acres.

22:28.153 --> 22:31.858
Which you are
barely holding onto as it is.

22:32.424 --> 22:33.926
As far as I can tell.

22:36.661 --> 22:37.563
Mr. Warren.

22:39.164 --> 22:40.600
This is Pierian Pond.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.203
My husband grew up here.

22:45.003 --> 22:47.240
And my children
played in this water.

22:48.307 --> 22:51.477
And it used to be as big as an
ocean, and it's smaller now, but...

22:52.176 --> 22:53.312
This is our home.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.515
It's beautiful to us.

22:56.514 --> 22:59.953
Well, I'm sure it's beautiful
to the mosquitoes, too.

23:03.488 --> 23:06.425
I came here today to tell you
that we received your letters.

23:08.494 --> 23:10.059
We're considering your offer.

23:10.061 --> 23:11.296
Well, keep considering.

23:12.630 --> 23:15.500
But remember, the wheels of progress
are moving fast, Mrs. Killian.

23:16.401 --> 23:17.302
Okay?

23:17.703 --> 23:19.239
With or without you.

23:28.179 --> 23:29.983
[groans] Gross.

23:31.382 --> 23:33.218
- [chuckling]
- What are you laughing at?

23:33.551 --> 23:34.419
Nothing.

23:35.286 --> 23:37.890
Well, let's get it in there.

23:39.058 --> 23:41.461
- It's a she.
- How do you know?

23:42.160 --> 23:44.930
- Are you really asking me that?
- [chuckles]

23:45.464 --> 23:47.000
Yeah, okay. [laughs]

23:48.467 --> 23:50.269
- [Peter] Maybe we should cover her wings.
- [Sydney clicks her tongue]

24:11.423 --> 24:13.026
He's just trying to help.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.361
[Peter] I don't think its leg
is broken, so that's good.

24:18.163 --> 24:21.434
What about her... wing?

24:24.102 --> 24:25.138
I don't know.

24:26.504 --> 24:28.206
So what are you gonna do?

24:29.608 --> 24:31.674
I have some bandages
and stuff at home.

24:31.676 --> 24:33.279
I might be able to make
a splint or something.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.684
And then I also have some books
on horse medicine, but...

24:39.283 --> 24:40.719
I think she's gonna be fine.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.254
I don't know, Peter.
Maybe we should call someone.

24:45.256 --> 24:46.458
- No. No.
- Or...

24:47.426 --> 24:49.061
This has got to be
our secret, okay?

24:50.029 --> 24:51.196
You promise?

24:52.164 --> 24:53.166
Say it.

24:53.564 --> 24:54.600
Promise.

24:57.668 --> 24:58.705
[sighs]

25:00.438 --> 25:03.008
We're gonna cure this horse,

25:04.176 --> 25:05.077
take care of her,

25:06.044 --> 25:08.680
and get her back
to wherever she came from.

25:10.049 --> 25:11.350
Wherever that is.

25:12.384 --> 25:13.486
Must be starving.

25:14.153 --> 25:15.655
I can do something
about that.

25:25.363 --> 25:27.664
Whoa, whoa, whoa, J.R
Let's wait. [giggles]

25:27.666 --> 25:30.069
There we go. He's excited
to get back inside.

25:32.471 --> 25:34.574
[clicks tongue]

25:42.613 --> 25:45.050
- And you said this town was boring, right?
- [chuckles]

25:50.789 --> 25:51.691
I, um...

25:53.157 --> 25:55.061
I'd better get going.

25:56.727 --> 25:59.599
Hmm. No worries.
I got this.

26:05.603 --> 26:07.739
What are you waiting for? Go.

26:15.781 --> 26:16.749
[sighs]

26:26.390 --> 26:27.259
Mom.

26:27.693 --> 26:28.795
Hi, baby.

26:30.529 --> 26:33.499
Sure is beautiful here, isn't it?
Even if you can't see it.

26:36.767 --> 26:38.403
You can see it though,
right?

26:40.606 --> 26:41.871
Yeah.

26:41.873 --> 26:43.442
Are we gonna have to move?

26:46.811 --> 26:48.648
Your dad and I have
a lot to consider, so...

26:51.782 --> 26:52.819
Sydney.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.436
You're still here, Simon?

27:11.869 --> 27:13.205
Time to go home already?

27:13.638 --> 27:14.773
I'm afraid so.

27:17.775 --> 27:18.875
Bye, Nate.

27:18.877 --> 27:21.446
Bye, Simon. [chuckles]

27:28.753 --> 27:30.322
Get real, Gus.

27:30.755 --> 27:32.859
[scoffs]
You're talking crazy.

27:33.591 --> 27:34.893
Aliens aren't real.

27:36.294 --> 27:37.496
How do you know?

27:38.964 --> 27:41.565
I saw the pond.
It was flashing green.

27:41.567 --> 27:43.803
You mean there's a spaceship
hiding under there?

27:46.271 --> 27:48.637
Now I know where our son
gets all those crazy ideas.

27:48.639 --> 27:51.343
- Hey.
- I saw something, Emily.

27:52.778 --> 27:53.913
Did you tell anyone?

27:56.281 --> 27:57.550
No, not yet.

28:00.218 --> 28:01.318
[Emily] Good.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.487
Please don't.

28:03.421 --> 28:05.190
Okay? We need this job.

28:11.530 --> 28:12.665
[dog barks]

28:18.603 --> 28:19.504
Aliens?

28:20.638 --> 28:22.574
[dishes clattering]

28:41.426 --> 28:42.461
[utensils clattering]

28:56.707 --> 28:57.609
Hey.

28:59.278 --> 28:59.979
You okay?

29:01.713 --> 29:02.748
I'm busy.

29:04.049 --> 29:05.785
Did you have fun at Simon's?

29:06.451 --> 29:08.354
I bet you got a lot of plans
for the summer.

29:08.919 --> 29:11.724
What kind of crazy contraption
is he working on now?

29:12.291 --> 29:16.725
I don't care. I'm sick of Simon
and his stupid ideas.

29:16.727 --> 29:19.831
Hey. I thought he was
your best friend.

29:20.331 --> 29:21.801
Not for long.

29:22.501 --> 29:23.735
What is that supposed to mean?

29:27.539 --> 29:28.507
We're not moving.

29:29.573 --> 29:31.007
We're not selling the ranch.

29:31.009 --> 29:32.709
Yes, we are.

29:32.711 --> 29:34.511
Mom and Dad are just going
to keep fighting

29:34.513 --> 29:37.379
all summer long
and then we're gonna move.

29:37.381 --> 29:39.316
[Sydney] They won't
let that happen.

29:39.318 --> 29:41.854
Yes, they will.
Just leave me alone.

29:53.031 --> 29:55.434
[buzzing]

30:07.012 --> 30:09.048
[buzzing continues]

30:31.436 --> 30:33.739
[birds chirping]

30:49.987 --> 30:51.823
[horse whinnying]

31:17.815 --> 31:18.983
Hello?

31:20.084 --> 31:21.486
Sydney?

31:24.990 --> 31:26.959
Oh, my gosh! Jonathan!

31:27.559 --> 31:29.595
[sighs]
What are you doing here?

31:30.195 --> 31:31.661
You scared me.

31:31.663 --> 31:34.030
I scared you? You scared me.

31:34.032 --> 31:36.034
What are you doing
out here?

31:37.601 --> 31:40.705
N... Nothing unusual or strange.

31:43.041 --> 31:43.943
Why?

31:45.142 --> 31:46.809
I know you're hiding something.

31:46.811 --> 31:49.646
Nothing. I'm just cleaning up.

31:49.648 --> 31:50.683
Jonathan!

31:52.516 --> 31:54.820
A horse? What's the big deal?

31:55.654 --> 31:58.590
She's a pony,
and it depends.

31:58.990 --> 32:00.656
Can you keep a secret?

32:00.658 --> 32:02.962
- Whatever. I'm heading back.
- Jonathan.

32:03.695 --> 32:04.730
What?

32:06.497 --> 32:08.533
You can't tell anyone.

32:12.670 --> 32:16.806
It's just like in that lame
old story your read to me.

32:16.808 --> 32:19.041
Not so lame now, huh?

32:19.043 --> 32:20.876
Where did you find him?

32:20.878 --> 32:22.415
- Her.
- Her.

32:23.048 --> 32:25.017
In the woods.
Just over the hill.

32:26.650 --> 32:27.753
Can I pet her?

32:37.161 --> 32:38.997
What happened to her wing?

32:40.264 --> 32:43.436
She's hurt.
But we're gonna help her.

32:44.703 --> 32:45.667
"We"?

32:45.669 --> 32:46.772
[Peter] Hey.

32:49.773 --> 32:52.008
[Sydney] Jonathan,
this is my friend, Peter.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.646
He just moved in next door.

32:54.012 --> 32:55.714
Peter, this is
my brother, Jonathan.

32:58.716 --> 33:00.518
[whispers]
Is he your boyfriend?

33:01.218 --> 33:03.955
He is a boy who is my friend.

33:04.755 --> 33:08.590
But we literally met yesterday,
so slow your roll, dude.

33:08.592 --> 33:10.128
He's just helping us
with Harmonia.

33:10.762 --> 33:11.730
Har who, now?

33:12.062 --> 33:12.965
[Sydney] Harmonia.

33:13.831 --> 33:15.167
Greek goddess
of peace and harmony.

33:15.667 --> 33:18.036
I think it's rather fitting,
don't you?

33:19.571 --> 33:22.073
Harmony for short. I like it.

33:24.009 --> 33:25.674
Whoa. Shh.

33:25.676 --> 33:27.178
- It's okay.
- It's okay, girl.

33:27.878 --> 33:30.549
[groans]
Hey, can you help me?

33:30.916 --> 33:34.220
- Sure. How?
- Why don't you get some food so she'll be more calm?

33:34.785 --> 33:35.918
[Jonathan] Okay.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.088
[Peter] All right.

33:43.128 --> 33:46.663
Easy there, girl.
We just wanna help.

33:46.665 --> 33:49.667
We just wanna
make you feel better.

33:52.337 --> 33:55.338
Very good. Just like that. Good.

33:55.340 --> 33:57.240
[Peter chuckles]
Your brother's a real natural.

33:57.242 --> 33:59.207
He doesn't even
like horses.

33:59.209 --> 34:00.676
This is no horse.

34:00.678 --> 34:03.812
This is Harmony,
daughter of Pegasus.

34:03.814 --> 34:05.083
[Sydney and Peter chuckle]

34:08.284 --> 34:10.755
What are you,
a vet or something?

34:11.156 --> 34:14.860
[Peter] Uh, not yet,
but I'm doing my best.

34:22.967 --> 34:24.969
Harmony's out cold, sleeping.

34:25.337 --> 34:26.936
Is she gonna be okay?

34:26.938 --> 34:29.174
I don't know. I hope so.

34:29.873 --> 34:31.909
Why don't we
just ask for help?

34:32.610 --> 34:33.311
We can't.

34:34.145 --> 34:35.547
The grown-ups
wouldn't understand.

34:36.748 --> 34:39.317
You do realize that she could
solve all of our problems.

34:40.884 --> 34:41.920
What do you mean?

34:43.022 --> 34:46.324
Sydney didn't tell you?
We're about to lose the farm.

34:46.824 --> 34:49.594
Jonathan, no.
We have to save her.

34:50.295 --> 34:51.630
Look, um...

34:52.364 --> 34:53.232
Jonathan.

34:54.065 --> 34:55.301
If anyone found out...

34:56.201 --> 34:58.237
the military could come
and take her away.

34:59.938 --> 35:01.340
She can't help us save the farm.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.310
And we have to help her
fly home.

35:05.076 --> 35:06.211
Wherever that is.

35:07.377 --> 35:09.681
I, uh... I think I know somebody
who could help with that.

35:09.913 --> 35:12.051
[snorts, whinnies]

35:31.902 --> 35:33.136
[gasps] Are they...

35:33.138 --> 35:34.302
Shh!

35:34.304 --> 35:35.438
[whinnying]

35:35.440 --> 35:37.309
[both snorting, grunting]

35:51.322 --> 35:54.056
Do you think
they were talking back there?

35:54.058 --> 35:57.159
- I think so.
- Yeah, why are you guys acting so surprised?

35:57.161 --> 35:58.730
Didn't you know animals
can communicate?

35:59.730 --> 36:01.697
Not like that,
I didn't.

36:01.699 --> 36:04.099
Anyway, where's she going?

36:04.101 --> 36:05.002
No idea.

36:07.438 --> 36:09.308
[Sydney] Ah, I'm so
getting scared right now.

36:10.275 --> 36:12.311
J.R., where are you taking us?

36:28.726 --> 36:31.263
I don't get it.
What's he trying to tell us?

36:32.096 --> 36:33.331
Yeah, why did he lead us here?

36:34.065 --> 36:36.201
What's so special
about Pierian Pond?

36:41.739 --> 36:45.043
It's the pond from the story.
The one with the magic water.

36:47.779 --> 36:48.847
What's he talking about?

37:00.424 --> 37:01.325
Guys?

37:02.793 --> 37:07.362
Legend says that Harmony was born
out of a pond with mystical powers.

37:07.364 --> 37:10.201
It said whenever the water
touched the soil,

37:10.768 --> 37:12.367
magical flowers would bloom.

37:12.369 --> 37:13.438
[Peter chuckles]

37:14.304 --> 37:15.473
I guess it's
more than a legend.

37:16.174 --> 37:19.375
[horn blaring]

37:19.377 --> 37:20.411
What's that?

37:22.045 --> 37:23.815
[Sydney]
It's the siren for the workers.

37:28.185 --> 37:31.119
We have to get to the flowers
before they discover them.

37:31.121 --> 37:32.890
[indistinct chatter]

37:35.092 --> 37:37.462
[Peter] Let's come back later
when no one can see us.

37:38.462 --> 37:40.929
- Can I come?
- You better.

37:40.931 --> 37:42.100
You're one of us now.

37:55.813 --> 37:57.413
- Hey, Simon.
- Dad.

37:57.415 --> 37:59.418
- What are you doing in here?
- Building a scooter.

38:00.317 --> 38:02.754
You were always the smart one
around here.

38:04.054 --> 38:06.157
Hey, Dad.
Do you need something?

38:08.125 --> 38:11.028
[sighs]
What do you know about space?

38:12.063 --> 38:15.398
I know that Alpha Centauri is the
closest star system to our solar system,

38:15.400 --> 38:18.266
at a distance of 4.37 light-years away.
And that...

38:18.268 --> 38:20.369
Good, good. That'll be fine.
That'll be fine.

38:20.371 --> 38:22.407
Let me sh...
Let me show you something.

38:25.009 --> 38:26.145
I took this last night.

38:28.246 --> 38:29.214
What do you think?

38:30.315 --> 38:32.380
It's a new phenomenon
called glowing photosynthesis.

38:32.382 --> 38:34.616
It only happens
a couple times a year.

38:34.618 --> 38:35.519
You mean...

38:36.420 --> 38:38.353
Underwater plants
reflecting the sunlight

38:38.355 --> 38:39.989
they have accumulated
through the day.

38:39.991 --> 38:41.025
Plants?

38:41.592 --> 38:43.060
Can I show you something?

38:44.529 --> 38:46.197
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:46.630 --> 38:49.333
Can you guess what this is?

38:52.270 --> 38:54.971
Blue fireflies
in North Carolina.

38:54.973 --> 38:57.308
They only do that
two or three times a year.

38:58.877 --> 39:00.112
How'd you get so smart?

39:02.179 --> 39:04.415
So, let me show you what
I'm gonna do with the scooter.

39:05.549 --> 39:08.250
This is really, really powerful.

39:08.252 --> 39:09.888
It can climb
a pretty steep incline.

39:11.255 --> 39:14.123
Is that legal
at your age?

39:14.125 --> 39:15.260
Legal?

39:16.360 --> 39:18.927
Yeah, you know, I don't want
anything to happen to you.

39:18.929 --> 39:21.567
- You know, just tell me.
- Uh, yeah. Sure it is.

39:22.132 --> 39:25.203
Well, that's great, then.
I'm very proud of you, Son.

39:25.670 --> 39:26.572
Thanks, Dad.

39:27.605 --> 39:28.907
Hey, Dad.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.576
Aren't you forgetting something?

39:49.960 --> 39:51.295
[Simon on tablet]
<i>Hey, check this out.</i>

39:53.665 --> 39:55.234
How did you get this?

39:55.667 --> 39:59.268
<i>My dad said he saw aliens
last night or something.</i>

39:59.270 --> 40:00.438
<i>Do you know what it is?</i>

40:01.139 --> 40:02.672
I have to go. Now.

40:02.674 --> 40:04.042
- Bye.
- [Simon] <i>Bye.</i>

40:08.346 --> 40:09.982
Guys, look at this.

40:14.985 --> 40:17.386
- Where'd you get that?
- Simon sent it to me.

40:17.388 --> 40:20.155
He said his father
took the video last night.

40:20.157 --> 40:22.326
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

40:26.096 --> 40:28.132
You do realize
what this means.

40:29.567 --> 40:31.103
That legacy was right.

40:31.703 --> 40:33.205
It is a magic pond.

40:36.473 --> 40:38.643
- [chattering]
- [engine starting]

40:52.089 --> 40:55.559
Mr. Warren. I think
you need to come see this.

40:58.096 --> 41:00.529
[Warren] How many times do I have
to tell you? Stay on schedule.

41:00.531 --> 41:01.933
Time is money.

41:02.699 --> 41:03.968
What is this?

41:06.536 --> 41:07.505
Destroy these.

41:07.739 --> 41:09.005
Boss, we don't own this yet.

41:09.007 --> 41:10.438
But we will own this!

41:10.440 --> 41:11.706
I don't want anything
slowing us down,

41:11.708 --> 41:13.608
including pretty flowers.

41:13.610 --> 41:15.413
So, destroy these right now.

41:16.047 --> 41:19.047
All right, guys. Pull everything up.
Don't leave anything behind.

41:19.049 --> 41:19.951
Go!

41:39.103 --> 41:41.974
Well, if it isn't
Nathaniel Craft.

41:43.107 --> 41:44.208
Hello, Sandra.

41:45.676 --> 41:47.712
So, who's the lucky gal?

41:48.679 --> 41:51.583
These... are for you.

41:52.616 --> 41:53.651
Oh.

41:56.386 --> 41:57.254
[sniffs]

41:58.121 --> 41:59.587
Well, it's been a long time

41:59.589 --> 42:01.726
since a handsome man
brought me flowers.

42:03.728 --> 42:06.665
Well, come on. Let's go inside
and put them in some water.

42:09.299 --> 42:12.269
I'll bet you'd love
some ice cold lemonade.

42:12.703 --> 42:15.172
That sounds just about perfect.

42:15.572 --> 42:16.507
Come on.

42:24.614 --> 42:25.649
[sighs]

42:26.650 --> 42:28.317
Hey, baby.

42:28.319 --> 42:29.587
How you doing, J.R.?

42:31.121 --> 42:32.023
Hmm?

42:32.958 --> 42:35.260
Let's go for a ride.
Would you like that?

42:36.159 --> 42:37.826
Let's go for a ride. Come on.

42:37.828 --> 42:40.698
Come on. Good boy. Come on.

43:25.176 --> 43:26.210
You ready?

43:47.531 --> 43:50.634
[J.R. snorts, whinnies]

44:13.523 --> 44:14.759
Looking good.

44:21.232 --> 44:22.801
I'm so glad
you came to visit.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.302
Can we do it again?

44:25.735 --> 44:27.138
I'd like that.

44:28.471 --> 44:30.841
- [J.R. whinnying]
- I don't believe it.

44:31.708 --> 44:33.741
[Sandra laughs]

44:33.743 --> 44:36.779
And we thought that horse
was just about to keel over.

44:36.781 --> 44:39.518
I told you.
It's a magical day.

44:41.319 --> 44:42.918
Well, I guess
you're right.

45:53.757 --> 45:55.590
You're such a good boy.

45:55.592 --> 45:57.625
- [Melanie] He's the best boy.
- [Sydney] Hey, bud.

45:57.627 --> 45:58.763
Hey, bud.

45:59.797 --> 46:01.596
[Josh] That was
quite a surprise.

46:01.598 --> 46:03.465
J.R. looks like
he's doing a lot better.

46:03.467 --> 46:04.669
It's incredible,
isn't it?

46:04.902 --> 46:07.672
You... I have never
seen you this happy.

46:10.473 --> 46:12.376
- Your mom is watching.
- My mom is?

46:12.877 --> 46:14.442
Hey. Hi, Mom.

46:14.444 --> 46:15.746
Mr. Craft.

46:17.714 --> 46:19.882
I'm gonna kiss my wife.

46:19.884 --> 46:21.286
Just a little bit.

46:22.886 --> 46:24.321
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

- What?
- [laughs]

46:28.826 --> 46:30.494
That's not... This is not gross.

I'll show you gross.

That's gross!

- [grunts] Did you get to ride, too?
- Yeah.

46:40.638 --> 46:41.804
- He did.
- Yeah? How'd you do?

46:41.806 --> 46:43.008
He did so well.

46:45.643 --> 46:47.675
[Warren] So, how much
longer is that gonna take?

46:47.677 --> 46:50.346
- It's done.
- And it'll record all night?

46:50.348 --> 46:51.983
- Twelve hours, continuous.
- Perfect.

46:52.549 --> 46:54.583
- You don't have to...
- No, no. Take it.

46:54.585 --> 46:55.954
It's for your silence.

46:56.487 --> 46:58.356
All right, I gotta make
a phone call.

47:01.759 --> 47:02.661
Yep.

- Hello?

47:16.373 --> 47:17.875
Oh, hi, Mr. Warren.

47:20.578 --> 47:23.815
Yes, um, this isn't a really
good time right now. I...

47:24.581 --> 47:26.951
No, we haven't made
a decision yet.

47:27.485 --> 47:28.753
We're about...

47:29.520 --> 47:31.487
We're about to have dinner.

47:31.489 --> 47:33.989
Mr. Warren, hi. I don't
know if you heard my wife.

47:33.991 --> 47:36.427
She said it's not
a good time. Good-bye.

47:38.661 --> 47:40.464
[laughs]

47:41.732 --> 47:42.801
[Melanie] Oh, I love it.

47:44.868 --> 47:46.670
What did you kids
do today?

47:47.737 --> 47:49.573
- Nothing much.
- Nothing?

47:51.475 --> 47:54.478
- Nothing?
- Well, we hung out with Peter a bit.

47:55.045 --> 47:56.512
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh.

47:56.514 --> 47:57.816
Seems like
a nice enough kid.

47:59.516 --> 48:01.583
He's Sydney's new boyfriend.

48:01.585 --> 48:02.985
Shut up, Jonathan.

48:02.987 --> 48:04.122
What?

48:04.955 --> 48:06.721
He's not my boyfriend.

48:06.723 --> 48:08.692
And he is nice.

48:09.159 --> 48:10.895
He wants to become
a veterinarian.

48:11.127 --> 48:13.964
Really? Well, maybe we
have him to thank for J.R.

48:14.565 --> 48:16.197
[chuckles] Yeah, maybe.

48:16.199 --> 48:19.201
Maybe we should call
an actual vet.

48:19.203 --> 48:21.005
- No.
- No?

48:23.072 --> 48:25.509
I mean, J.R.'s fine.

48:25.842 --> 48:27.611
Everything's good. Um...

48:28.045 --> 48:30.081
We don't need to waste
any more time or money.

48:30.714 --> 48:32.780
All right.
Good enough for me.

48:32.782 --> 48:34.018
Let's not waste
any more money.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.022
You know,
I've got a good feeling.

48:40.089 --> 48:41.658
Yeah? What kind of feeling?

48:41.926 --> 48:44.826
Like things are finally
going to turn around again

48:44.828 --> 48:46.527
and everything's
gonna be all right.

Shh.

50:48.886 --> 50:49.951
[chuckles]

50:49.953 --> 50:51.887
- [snickers]
- Oh!

50:51.889 --> 50:54.889
Hey. What are
you guys up to?

50:54.891 --> 50:57.224
Uh, oh, we're going
to play outside.

50:57.226 --> 50:58.263
Go.

51:36.199 --> 51:38.833
[Peter grunts]
I sure hope this works.

51:38.835 --> 51:41.038
- It has to.
- I can't wait to see the magic.

51:41.705 --> 51:43.137
It's gonna be amazing.

51:43.139 --> 51:45.706
Harmony's gonna eat
some magic flowers

51:45.708 --> 51:47.141
and get well again.

51:47.143 --> 51:48.645
You'll see.

52:01.759 --> 52:03.860
[Peter] Hey, look.
Where'd these flowers come from?

52:16.906 --> 52:17.808
[grunts]

52:19.677 --> 52:20.712
We're good.

52:21.078 --> 52:23.648
[sighs] Oh, no. Look.

52:24.415 --> 52:27.918
[sighs] Let me try
one more time.

52:31.989 --> 52:33.023
[grunts]

52:40.029 --> 52:42.799
Hey, can your bag hold water?

52:43.433 --> 52:44.735
We can try.

52:50.206 --> 52:52.042
The water may help
Harmony feel better.

53:02.418 --> 53:03.286
[grunts]

53:04.321 --> 53:05.954
[Gus] Hey, you kids!
What are you doing over there?

53:05.956 --> 53:07.659
We need to go now.

53:58.141 --> 54:00.310
[Sydney] I hope this water
helps her wounds.

54:15.958 --> 54:20.098
[Sydney] <i>Sadly, the flower was
dead, and it didn't help Harmony.</i>

54:22.098 --> 54:25.368
<i>We've got to bring Harmony
directly to the flowers.</i>

54:26.869 --> 54:27.971
[yawns]

54:29.172 --> 54:30.373
I'm gonna go to sleep.

54:31.975 --> 54:34.212
Do you think
she's going to die?

54:35.179 --> 54:37.482
We'll save her.
I know we will.

54:39.049 --> 54:40.884
Can we keep her if we do?

54:41.518 --> 54:44.956
She doesn't belong to us.
This isn't her home.

54:46.857 --> 54:48.259
I'm gonna miss her.

54:48.859 --> 54:50.027
We all will.

54:50.360 --> 54:52.561
But just think about
how beautiful it will be

54:52.563 --> 54:54.799
when we reunite her
with her father.

54:55.998 --> 54:57.467
You mean Pegasus?

54:58.134 --> 54:59.302
I sure hope so.

55:00.304 --> 55:02.436
You really think he exists?

55:02.438 --> 55:04.371
Well... [laughs]

55:04.373 --> 55:06.511
Until two days ago,
I wasn't sure.

55:07.277 --> 55:09.344
But now,
what do you think?

55:09.346 --> 55:10.882
[yawns]

55:14.585 --> 55:16.150
I want to believe!

55:16.152 --> 55:18.386
[laughs] Good.

55:18.388 --> 55:19.790
Go to sleep.

55:24.194 --> 55:26.161
[Sydney, echoing]
<i>The ancient Greeks told a tale</i>

55:26.163 --> 55:28.896
<i>of a winged white stallion
named Pegasus.</i>

55:28.898 --> 55:33.003
<i>Pegasus had two wondrous wings
that made him lord of the skie.</i>

55:33.569 --> 55:36.036
<i>Wherever Pegasus
would tread upon the earth,</i>

55:36.038 --> 55:38.172
<i>springs would magically appear,</i>

55:38.174 --> 55:41.208
<i>bringing with them flowers,
plants and fruit</i>

55:41.210 --> 55:43.113
<i>that fed on
the nourishing waters.</i>

55:45.982 --> 55:51.087
[Sydney] Jonathan, ask Simon to use his
scooter to bring Harmony to the flowers.

55:59.061 --> 56:01.496
Can you finish the scooter
by tonight?

56:01.498 --> 56:05.132
- <i>Maybe.</i>
- I'm not asking much, Simon.

56:05.134 --> 56:07.235
- Come on.
- <i>I want to know why.</i>

56:07.237 --> 56:08.670
I can't tell you.

56:08.672 --> 56:11.306
But I warn you,
you won't believe me.

56:11.308 --> 56:12.376
<i>Shoot.</i>

56:13.009 --> 56:15.009
You know about Pegasus.

56:15.011 --> 56:18.313
- <i>The Greek?</i>
- His daughter fell from the sky, breaking a wing,

56:18.315 --> 56:22.583
and the only way to heal is to eat
the magic flowers from Pierian Pond.

56:22.585 --> 56:25.453
But the flowers die
if we bring them to her.

56:25.455 --> 56:28.989
I need your scooter
to take Harmony to the pond.

56:28.991 --> 56:30.525
<i>Who is Harmony?</i>

56:30.527 --> 56:32.259
The daughter of Pegasus.

56:32.261 --> 56:34.529
<i>Do you really expect me
to believe you?</i>

56:34.531 --> 56:38.099
You finish the scooter
and I'll prove it to you.

56:38.101 --> 56:39.136
<i>Deal.</i>

57:23.246 --> 57:25.179
Mr. Warren. What is going on?

57:25.181 --> 57:27.081
That's actually
a question I have for you.

57:27.083 --> 57:28.516
I don't understand.

57:28.518 --> 57:30.384
Yeah, well, your kids
and another kid

57:30.386 --> 57:31.753
trespassed on my property
last night.

57:31.755 --> 57:33.355
- That's impossible.
- Really?

57:33.357 --> 57:35.226
Well, here's footage
of your daughter

57:35.726 --> 57:37.461
contaminating my pond.

57:43.032 --> 57:44.534
Sydney? Jonathan?

57:51.141 --> 57:54.141
We are very sorry that we
trespassed on your property,

57:54.143 --> 57:56.210
and we promise
never to do it again.

57:56.212 --> 57:58.315
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

57:59.348 --> 58:01.181
What does that mean?
They're just kids.

58:01.183 --> 58:03.617
Yeah, I know, I know,
but I had to drain the pond

58:03.619 --> 58:06.154
and then refill it
with uncontaminated water.

58:06.156 --> 58:09.527
You probably have no idea how
expensive an operation like that is.

58:10.694 --> 58:12.293
What have you kids done?

58:12.295 --> 58:14.596
I think we know
what the kids did.

58:14.598 --> 58:18.032
I mean, it's pretty clear. The question
is, what are you willing to do?

58:18.034 --> 58:21.705
- What does that mean?
- I mean, I could press charges, or...

58:22.339 --> 58:25.040
you could sign the contract
and sell me this place,

58:25.042 --> 58:27.143
and I could forget
this accident ever happened.

58:28.145 --> 58:30.145
- That's blackmail.
- I'd be really careful

58:30.147 --> 58:33.447
about the terms you use, 'cause
I got witnesses and a videotape.

58:33.449 --> 58:34.551
Kids.

58:36.453 --> 58:38.619
Is there something that we would
like to say to Mr. Warren?

58:38.621 --> 58:41.355
- But we didn't do anything wrong.
- You poisoned my pond.

58:41.357 --> 58:43.360
- No, we didn't.
- We're sorry.

58:44.661 --> 58:46.460
Kids, can you go
in the other room, please?

58:46.462 --> 58:47.731
Right now. Go.

58:49.366 --> 58:52.132
Mr. Warren, why don't you
come back another time

58:52.134 --> 58:53.333
while my husband's home?

58:53.335 --> 58:54.604
Here's the contract.

58:55.337 --> 58:57.707
Sign it, and I'll be
back to pick it up.

59:00.409 --> 59:01.444
See you later.

59:06.817 --> 59:07.717
[Gus] Hmm.

59:08.752 --> 59:11.022
Suppose I have to start
looking for a new job.

59:13.290 --> 59:15.857
You didn't hear
a thing? Really?

59:15.859 --> 59:18.726
I told you,
I... I was watching TV.

59:18.728 --> 59:20.364
It gets lonely there.

59:21.197 --> 59:22.266
And where's Simon?

59:22.598 --> 59:24.534
I mean, these are
his friends, after all.

59:26.136 --> 59:27.237
Just let me handle it.

59:46.589 --> 59:48.425
I'm sure
you didn't mean to, Dad.

59:49.259 --> 59:50.458
That's okay.

59:50.460 --> 59:52.527
No, it's not okay.

59:52.529 --> 59:54.665
I didn't really
like that job anyways.

59:57.868 --> 59:59.503
You know why
they did it?

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.273
You won't believe me.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.442
[scoffs]

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.076
Try me.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.202
[Josh] Hey, honey.

01:00:32.868 --> 01:00:34.104
Uh-oh.

01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:36.538
What happened?

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.574
Come on.

01:00:42.444 --> 01:00:45.445
[clicks tongue] Well,
it doesn't sound good.

01:00:45.447 --> 01:00:47.451
No, Mom, it's not good.

01:00:49.418 --> 01:00:50.321
I'm sorry.

01:00:53.956 --> 01:00:56.393
Well, [sighs]
what do you suggest?

01:00:57.594 --> 01:01:00.764
Well, we can either sell
the property...

01:01:01.831 --> 01:01:04.635
or explain the situation
to a judge.

01:01:05.268 --> 01:01:08.536
Warren has bought every
single official in this town.

01:01:08.538 --> 01:01:10.206
No judge will help us.

01:01:11.741 --> 01:01:13.177
It's all my fault.

01:01:13.476 --> 01:01:15.342
I filled their heads
with all those stories

01:01:15.344 --> 01:01:17.344
about Pierian Pond and...

01:01:17.346 --> 01:01:19.480
[doorbell rings]

01:01:19.482 --> 01:01:21.252
[sighs] Who now?

01:01:25.487 --> 01:01:26.489
[mutters]

01:01:26.956 --> 01:01:29.257
- Hi, Simon.
- [Simon] Hi.

01:01:29.259 --> 01:01:31.491
- Hi.
- Hello, I'm Gus, Simon's dad.

01:01:31.493 --> 01:01:33.863
Nice to meet you.
Hi. Come on in.

01:01:36.433 --> 01:01:38.800
I'm sorry, Simon,
but Jonathan is grounded.

01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:40.701
Oh, we're not here
for a playdate.

01:01:40.703 --> 01:01:42.539
- Oh?
- May we take a seat?

01:01:43.373 --> 01:01:44.771
Uh, of course.

01:01:44.773 --> 01:01:46.310
You may wanna sit down
for this, too.

01:01:52.315 --> 01:01:53.282
[sighs]

01:01:54.516 --> 01:01:56.583
So Simon was telling me
this incredible story,

01:01:56.585 --> 01:01:57.687
and I need to check it out.

01:01:58.388 --> 01:01:59.956
Do y'all know anything
about Harmony?

01:02:01.424 --> 01:02:02.991
Um, who?

01:02:02.993 --> 01:02:05.462
Your little white pony.

01:02:05.895 --> 01:02:09.532
- [chuckles] We don't...
- We don't have any ponies on this property.

01:02:10.933 --> 01:02:13.203
Well, that's not
what Simon's saying.

01:02:13.737 --> 01:02:16.637
Dude, you were supposed to
keep this a secret.

01:02:16.639 --> 01:02:18.576
You are supposed to be
in your room, young man.

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.346
I'll tell the story.

01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:29.619
[Sydney] <i>Remember the storm
three nights ago?</i>

01:02:30.753 --> 01:02:32.889
<i>Mom and Dad
were fighting about the farm.</i>

01:02:35.991 --> 01:02:37.493
<i>I was so sad.</i>

01:02:37.993 --> 01:02:39.960
<i>I couldn't bear the idea</i>

01:02:39.962 --> 01:02:42.365
<i>of seeing this family
torn apart.</i>

01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:45.933
<i>I didn't wanna leave
this beautiful place.</i>

01:02:45.935 --> 01:02:48.272
[thunder roars]

01:02:49.706 --> 01:02:52.610
<i>That's when I heard it
for the first time.</i>

01:02:58.447 --> 01:03:00.451
[thunder rumbling]

01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:06.987
<i>I looked up,
but I didn't see it.</i>

01:03:06.989 --> 01:03:08.591
<i>The sky was dark.</i>

01:03:16.933 --> 01:03:18.002
<i>The next morning</i>

01:03:18.868 --> 01:03:20.603
<i>Peter and I went on a walk.</i>

01:03:22.871 --> 01:03:25.308
<i>That's when we found
giant feathers</i>

01:03:26.076 --> 01:03:28.045
<i>like we've never seen before.</i>

01:03:29.411 --> 01:03:31.047
<i>J.R. got very nervous.</i>

01:03:32.482 --> 01:03:34.518
<i>I think he knew what they were.</i>

01:03:36.585 --> 01:03:38.455
<i>That's when we found Harmony.</i>

01:03:38.922 --> 01:03:42.793
<i>She was standing under
a snag tree by Pierian Pond.</i>

01:03:44.893 --> 01:03:49.399
<i>And from that moment on,
this has become a happier plac.</i>

01:04:09.118 --> 01:04:11.654
Hang in there, girl.
We're all friends.

01:04:12.621 --> 01:04:13.790
We're just trying
to help.

01:04:25.634 --> 01:04:28.471
I can't believe it.
It is true.

01:04:28.904 --> 01:04:30.107
It's all true.

01:04:32.609 --> 01:04:33.643
Can I...

01:04:34.743 --> 01:04:36.713
She doesn't really trust adults.

01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:39.750
Sydney, what...

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:41.782
What's your plan?

01:04:41.784 --> 01:04:43.453
We have to take her to the pond.

01:04:44.154 --> 01:04:45.621
That's not gonna be easy.

01:04:46.054 --> 01:04:47.590
Simon and I have a plan.

01:04:48.123 --> 01:04:49.525
You can really help?

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.597
I'll do whatever it takes
to take down Daniel Warren.

01:05:02.906 --> 01:05:04.641
Dad got me an engine
at the junkyard.

01:05:05.574 --> 01:05:07.775
That's right. Now you get
to show them how smart you are.

01:05:07.777 --> 01:05:09.110
Jonathan, I need your help.

01:05:09.112 --> 01:05:10.947
- Aye aye, Captain.
- Uh, Peter.

01:05:15.118 --> 01:05:17.154
All right, guys. Let's get
this thing off of here.

01:05:18.587 --> 01:05:19.922
Get ready. Go.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.163
All right.

01:05:28.831 --> 01:05:30.400
- Jonathan.
- [Gus] Tools.

01:05:33.168 --> 01:05:35.069
So, this is the brake
and the clutch.

01:05:35.071 --> 01:05:36.973
To turn it on, you need
to put that to start

01:05:37.607 --> 01:05:39.172
- and you need to put it into gear.
- Yeah. But not yet.

01:05:39.174 --> 01:05:40.641
We still gotta fix the engine.

01:05:40.643 --> 01:05:41.512
Right.

01:05:42.045 --> 01:05:43.080
Yeah, buddy.

01:05:53.956 --> 01:05:55.525
- [Peter] Hey.
- Peter, all right.

01:05:56.192 --> 01:05:58.594
I want you to tighten
this bolt for me, okay?

01:06:05.067 --> 01:06:07.571
- [Sydney] Here's some lemonade.
- Here you go, boys.

01:06:11.007 --> 01:06:12.643
This is good stuff.
[exclaims]

01:06:14.076 --> 01:06:16.913
Don't mind a little finger
there, do you? [laughs]

01:06:18.514 --> 01:06:20.783
All right, let's work on
getting this thing started.

01:06:21.918 --> 01:06:23.686
Okay, Son, try it.

01:06:25.087 --> 01:06:27.056
No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay.
Hold on one second.

01:06:30.659 --> 01:06:32.893
- All right, come on.
- [engine starts]

01:06:32.895 --> 01:06:35.231
All right.
Let's go. Come on.

01:06:42.639 --> 01:06:45.072
[Gus]
Okay. Here.

01:06:45.074 --> 01:06:46.577
I know what I can do
to help.

01:06:47.143 --> 01:06:49.179
We got it.
You mind helping me in the back?

01:06:51.647 --> 01:06:54.050
Right. I'm gonna
sign it right now.

01:06:54.951 --> 01:06:56.650
We're gonna make America
great again.

01:06:56.652 --> 01:06:59.020
I'll leave the envelope
on the front door.

01:06:59.022 --> 01:07:00.824
Good deal. I'll get it.

01:07:05.127 --> 01:07:06.162
[sighs]

01:07:29.185 --> 01:07:30.721
[sighs]

01:07:50.272 --> 01:07:51.641
Yeah, right there.

01:07:56.045 --> 01:07:57.344
[Melanie]
That's the way to go.

01:07:57.346 --> 01:07:58.781
Come on, Son,
give it a try.

01:08:06.355 --> 01:08:07.755
[engine starts]

01:08:07.757 --> 01:08:09.889
- [Gus] There.
- [Melanie] Nice!

01:08:09.891 --> 01:08:10.960
[Jonathan]
It's working!

01:08:12.628 --> 01:08:13.828
[Peter] Good job.

01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:15.933
Just remember
to keep it on.

01:08:17.767 --> 01:08:19.736
- I'll wait for your signal.
- Okay.

01:08:21.803 --> 01:08:22.837
What?

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:29.112
Good luck.

01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.350
Okay, let's do this.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.620
Forgot something.

01:08:44.259 --> 01:08:45.294
[exhales]

01:08:49.231 --> 01:08:50.966
Okay, let's do this.

01:09:17.826 --> 01:09:19.328
- [Sydney] Oh, my God.
- [Peter] Oh.

01:09:20.295 --> 01:09:23.200
Hey. Gus, hey.
Come on.

01:09:23.765 --> 01:09:26.801
We don't have much time, all right? We
have to get her to the pond, now. Come on.

01:09:26.803 --> 01:09:29.170
- Come on, girl.
- [Jonathan] Be careful with the wings.

01:09:29.171 --> 01:09:32.408
[whinnying]

01:09:48.356 --> 01:09:49.392
Josh.

01:09:50.493 --> 01:09:51.727
Josh?

01:09:53.761 --> 01:09:55.097
[Sandra]
<i>Josh, can you hear me?</i>

01:09:56.365 --> 01:09:57.401
Loud and clear.

01:09:58.301 --> 01:09:59.766
Mr. Warren's here.

01:09:59.768 --> 01:10:00.870
Thank you.

01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:03.906
All right,
keep pushing.

01:10:10.213 --> 01:10:11.248
[exhales]

01:10:21.523 --> 01:10:22.758
[Sydney] Whoa.

01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:28.528
Keep pushing.

01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:30.132
- Push.
- Push, push.

01:10:37.807 --> 01:10:40.177
[Melanie] You're going into the
bushes a little. There you go.

01:10:40.877 --> 01:10:42.408
- [Gus] Wide, go wide.
- [Melanie] Keep pushing.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:43.778
Keep pushing, guys.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.182
Turn, turn.

01:10:48.417 --> 01:10:50.486
- [Josh] Right.
- [Melanie] Easy, easy.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.824
Okay, this is a good spot.
Right here, right here, stop.

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:55.926
Good job.

01:10:56.825 --> 01:10:57.828
Okay.

01:10:58.995 --> 01:11:01.865
Guys, so, unfortunately,
I think that was the easy part.

01:11:02.097 --> 01:11:06.100
Why don't you kids go down to
the pond and prep for the pony?

01:11:06.102 --> 01:11:10.741
And we need to make sure that
this doesn't run away downhill.

01:11:11.106 --> 01:11:12.506
- Gus, you got this with me?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:12.508 --> 01:11:13.873
- All right.
- [Melanie] All right.

01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:15.810
- Real slow. Ready?
- Go.

01:11:15.812 --> 01:11:17.981
- Okay, nice and slow.
- I still got you. Come on.

01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:20.217
Real, real slow.

01:11:23.386 --> 01:11:24.487
You got it, Gus?

01:11:30.392 --> 01:11:32.126
- [Melanie] Everybody okay?
- [Sydney] Yeah.

01:11:32.128 --> 01:11:33.429
[Melanie]
Easy, easy.

01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:35.999
Whoa.

01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:39.302
- [Gus] Easy. Easy.
- [Peter] Go.

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:06.562
- Okay, nice and slow.
- I still got you. Come on.

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:08.498
Real, real slow.

01:12:09.231 --> 01:12:10.564
There we go.

01:12:10.566 --> 01:12:11.968
There we go.

01:12:16.304 --> 01:12:18.208
- Almost there.
- Yeah, come on.

01:12:22.978 --> 01:12:24.580
- [Peter] Whoa.
- [Gus grunts]

01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:32.185
- All right, a little bit further.
- [Melanie] Everybody okay?

01:12:32.187 --> 01:12:33.088
[Sydney] Yeah.

01:12:35.223 --> 01:12:36.125
[Josh] All right.

01:12:40.396 --> 01:12:42.395
All right, slow.

01:12:42.397 --> 01:12:43.898
- Whoa, whoa!
- [Melanie] Whoa, whoa!

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.632
- Go, go, go!
- [grunting]

01:12:45.634 --> 01:12:47.204
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Sydney] Oh!

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:55.212
Sydney!

01:12:57.379 --> 01:12:58.547
Is she okay?

01:13:04.286 --> 01:13:05.187
[Peter]
She's all right.

01:13:06.187 --> 01:13:07.356
- She's all right.
- She's okay.

01:13:09.057 --> 01:13:10.125
[Sydney sighs]

01:13:11.326 --> 01:13:13.996
- Come on, We gotta go.
- [engine starts]

01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:26.542
Good luck, Mr. Warren.

01:13:29.344 --> 01:13:30.413
Path's clear.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.916
[Josh] <i>Hi, you hear me?</i>

01:13:33.581 --> 01:13:34.618
Josh?

01:13:36.419 --> 01:13:38.118
We're here.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.222
And it's time.

01:13:40.121 --> 01:13:41.490
I'll call him right away.

01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:48.264
[beeping]

01:13:49.298 --> 01:13:50.200
Nate?

01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:52.332
This is it.

01:13:52.334 --> 01:13:53.535
<i>Are you ready?</i>

01:13:55.036 --> 01:13:56.603
Uh, just arrived.

01:13:56.605 --> 01:13:58.508
We'll be there soon.
Okay.

01:13:59.642 --> 01:14:00.543
Hey.

01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:04.614
Is it so hard for you
to do your old uncle a favor?

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.350
It's fine. It's whatever.

01:14:08.249 --> 01:14:11.719
So, you still working for
that, uh, newspaper of yours?

01:14:11.721 --> 01:14:13.423
[scoffs] It's a blog.

01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:15.692
It's over two million followers.

01:14:19.027 --> 01:14:20.195
I don't see anyone.

01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:23.730
- It's online, Uncle Nate.
- [scoffs]

01:14:23.732 --> 01:14:25.131
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:25.133 --> 01:14:26.335
[sighs] Okay.

01:14:28.169 --> 01:14:29.071
I got it.

01:14:29.871 --> 01:14:31.070
- [Josh] Let's go!
- [Sydney] Faster!

01:14:31.072 --> 01:14:32.342
Hey, we need to go faster.

01:14:33.308 --> 01:14:35.009
Faster! We need to move!

01:14:35.011 --> 01:14:37.047
She's not gonna make it
much longer, guys.

01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:43.286
All right.
Let's open her up.

01:14:46.288 --> 01:14:47.324
Come on.

01:14:48.023 --> 01:14:49.256
[Harmony whinnies]

01:14:49.258 --> 01:14:51.061
[Sydney] Come on. Come on.

01:14:52.428 --> 01:14:54.297
Come on, Harmony.
Good girl.

01:14:54.597 --> 01:14:57.096
Good girl. Good girl, come on.

01:14:57.098 --> 01:14:58.668
We gotta go.
Come on.

01:15:00.402 --> 01:15:02.438
Okay, you're gonna
feel better, Harmony.

01:15:03.806 --> 01:15:05.773
Come on.
[chuckles] Come on.

01:15:05.775 --> 01:15:08.078
Let's go.
Quickly.

01:15:20.255 --> 01:15:21.421
Come on.

01:15:21.423 --> 01:15:22.658
Look. Look!

01:15:24.325 --> 01:15:27.260
Come on, baby.
Go on, look. Right here.

01:15:27.262 --> 01:15:30.600
Right here, right here.
Look. Hi.

01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:34.068
- Right here. Right there. Get...
- [Jonathan] Stop it.

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.505
- Come on. It's inside there.
- Come on, girl. Come on.

01:15:37.205 --> 01:15:39.105
Come on. Right there.

01:15:39.107 --> 01:15:40.709
- Right there.
- [Peter] There you go.

01:15:41.744 --> 01:15:43.377
[Sydney] Eat the flower.

01:15:43.379 --> 01:15:45.081
[Peter] She looks like
she's doing much better.

01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:48.051
[Sydney]
There you go.

01:15:49.819 --> 01:15:51.120
[Peter]
Let me check her leg.

01:15:54.824 --> 01:15:56.058
[sniffles]

01:16:00.129 --> 01:16:01.131
She's healed.

01:16:10.739 --> 01:16:13.676
[wings flapping]

01:16:19.647 --> 01:16:23.250
[wings flapping]

[whinnying]

01:16:24.553 --> 01:16:26.256
This can't be happening.

01:16:27.188 --> 01:16:28.324
But it is.

01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:31.190
- Do you wanna come with me?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:31.192 --> 01:16:32.294
Let's go.

01:16:36.331 --> 01:16:37.834
- [Sydney] Right there.
- [Peter] There you go.

01:16:38.801 --> 01:16:40.199
[Sydney] Eat the flower.

01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:41.804
It's amazing.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.212
- Right here.
- What is it I'm seeing now?

01:16:53.214 --> 01:16:55.317
Just do your job
and take the pictures.

01:16:58.286 --> 01:16:59.289
[shutter clicking]

01:17:00.522 --> 01:17:02.155
- [Peter] Chew more.
- [Sydney] Right here, right here.

01:17:02.157 --> 01:17:05.727
[gasps] Oh...
This is incredible.

01:17:06.361 --> 01:17:08.494
This is magic,
is what it is.

01:17:08.496 --> 01:17:10.600
[wings flapping]

01:17:11.366 --> 01:17:14.337
- What?
- [woman] Oh, my gosh. Look over there.

01:17:14.703 --> 01:17:15.705
- [exhales]
- Oh...

01:17:16.338 --> 01:17:18.241
[Nate] Oh, my gosh.

01:17:22.343 --> 01:17:24.379
- Wow. Wow.
- [laughing]

01:17:29.951 --> 01:17:31.186
Look.

01:17:32.288 --> 01:17:33.522
Pegasus.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.762
[woman] Oh, wow.
Look at him.

01:17:41.463 --> 01:17:43.197
He's so gorgeous.

01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:44.901
This is something else.

01:17:47.268 --> 01:17:49.403
[woman]
Oh, wow. Look at him.

01:17:49.405 --> 01:17:50.840
[Sydney] He's coming down
to land.

01:17:52.441 --> 01:17:54.408
[Peter]
This is unbelievable.

01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:55.876
[wings flapping]

01:17:55.878 --> 01:17:57.714
- [hooves clomping]
- [whinnying]

01:18:03.819 --> 01:18:05.452
- [neighing]
- Oh, my goodness.

01:18:05.454 --> 01:18:07.657
[sighs]

01:18:09.758 --> 01:18:10.793
[hums]

01:18:40.822 --> 01:18:41.958
[whinnying]

01:18:44.325 --> 01:18:47.860
Hey! Hey, hey!
This is private property.

01:18:47.862 --> 01:18:49.932
Get off my land, all of you.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:52.334
What are you hiding?
What are you... Move over!

01:18:52.834 --> 01:18:55.437
Move! What's behind you? Oh.

01:18:56.271 --> 01:18:58.273
Horses with wings.
Well, guess what?

01:18:58.574 --> 01:19:02.277
They're on my property, so now
they're my horses with wings.

01:19:02.544 --> 01:19:04.877
And also,
horses don't have wings.

01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:06.782
Okay? They're not real.

01:19:09.017 --> 01:19:11.920
- [Pegasus snorts]
- Okay, they are real.

01:19:13.021 --> 01:19:15.721
But... Hey, you,
stop filming right now.

01:19:15.723 --> 01:19:18.625
Too late.
This is already a live feed.

01:19:18.627 --> 01:19:21.295
And over $50,000 in donations
to save the ranch.

01:19:21.297 --> 01:19:24.030
To save the ranch? I own the ranch.
I bought it from Killian.

01:19:24.032 --> 01:19:26.869
You better check
those papers again, chief.

01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:38.811
[all laughing]

01:19:38.813 --> 01:19:40.747
The old disappearing ink...

01:19:40.749 --> 01:19:42.619
What are you,
12 years old, Josh?

01:19:43.451 --> 01:19:44.353
Okay.

01:19:44.753 --> 01:19:45.922
We'll see you in court.

01:19:46.487 --> 01:19:47.820
But I'm building my mall.

01:19:47.822 --> 01:19:49.723
I just want you to know,
all of you guys.

01:19:49.725 --> 01:19:52.359
Yeah, about that?
I don't really think so.

01:19:52.361 --> 01:19:53.926
See, in the past
ten minutes,

01:19:53.928 --> 01:19:55.628
I just started
an online petition

01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:57.767
to get this whole land
turned into a national park.

01:19:58.032 --> 01:19:59.901
Oh, really?
Well, that's not gonna work.

01:20:00.468 --> 01:20:04.003
So Mr. Warren, it's actually
you who are trespassing.

01:20:04.005 --> 01:20:06.342
Officers, you might
wanna take him away.

01:20:08.343 --> 01:20:10.379
All right, I'll leave.
You know what?

01:20:10.745 --> 01:20:12.681
Developing land
is too much trouble.

01:20:13.648 --> 01:20:17.050
All right, you guys are so...
This place is a dump, anyway.

01:20:17.052 --> 01:20:18.719
[both laughing]

01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:20.519
Bye-bye, Mr. Warren!

01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:22.391
- [Gus] Bye!
- [laughing]

01:20:23.726 --> 01:20:24.925
Ta-ta.

01:20:24.927 --> 01:20:27.897
[both laughing]

01:20:28.463 --> 01:20:31.465
Bye, Harmony.
We're gonna miss you.

01:20:31.467 --> 01:20:32.902
[Jonathan]
We're gonna miss you, girl.

01:20:34.436 --> 01:20:35.801
Have you ever been to Mars?

01:20:35.803 --> 01:20:37.636
Simon!

01:20:37.638 --> 01:20:39.441
What? I'm just curious.

01:20:44.679 --> 01:20:45.714
[Peter]
They're flying away.

01:21:01.996 --> 01:21:04.600
Mom, you made it.

01:21:05.032 --> 01:21:06.736
You had me so worried.

01:21:10.038 --> 01:21:12.040
You really are
the best father ever.

01:21:13.508 --> 01:21:16.111
You've got something
in your eye, Nate Craft.

01:21:17.745 --> 01:21:20.479
You, too, Sandra Killian.

01:21:20.481 --> 01:21:22.851
[both laughing]

01:21:25.087 --> 01:21:26.952
[Sandra]
That was just great.

01:21:26.954 --> 01:21:29.758
I loved it. You're a
good kid, you know that?

01:21:36.831 --> 01:21:39.067
[chattering]

01:21:49.044 --> 01:21:51.581
It's all right, buddy. We'll get
it running again tomorrow, okay?

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.555
Hey, Simon,
you built that?

01:22:00.989 --> 01:22:01.991
With a lot of help.

01:22:03.859 --> 01:22:05.695
Can you take me
for a ride tomorrow?

01:22:05.994 --> 01:22:08.798
- Sure. I'd love that.
- Thank you.

01:22:15.236 --> 01:22:17.539
I think your wish
just came true.

01:22:18.173 --> 01:22:19.509
It did.

01:22:22.244 --> 01:22:23.545
That was awesome.

01:22:23.846 --> 01:22:25.013
- So cool.
- Yeah.

01:22:25.914 --> 01:22:27.717
- Peter?
- Yeah, what's up?

01:22:28.784 --> 01:22:29.852
Thank you.

01:22:30.752 --> 01:22:31.888
It was no problem, I...

01:22:34.789 --> 01:22:35.690
Uh...

01:22:36.124 --> 01:22:37.224
[giggles]

01:22:37.226 --> 01:22:39.027
Hey, um...

01:22:40.027 --> 01:22:42.932
Yeah. Anyways,
that was really cool.

01:22:43.831 --> 01:22:46.632
See? I told you they were
boyfriend and girlfriend.

01:22:46.634 --> 01:22:48.503
[snickering]

01:22:53.642 --> 01:22:56.909
So, what else are we
gonna build this summer?

01:22:56.911 --> 01:22:58.244
A rocket.

01:22:58.246 --> 01:23:00.247
Another one? Really?

01:23:00.249 --> 01:23:02.114
Yep. A rocket to Mars.

01:23:02.116 --> 01:23:04.219
I have all the plans
set up at my house.

01:23:05.219 --> 01:23:07.923
All right,
let's do this.

01:23:14.029 --> 01:23:17.066
