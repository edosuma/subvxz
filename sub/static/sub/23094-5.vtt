WEBVTT

00:05.299 --> 00:08.203
When do we tell Anna?
Or Simon, for that matter.

00:08.236 --> 00:13.036
If you're asking me to lie,
I want something to make up for it.

00:13.133 --> 00:14.181
Do I like these people?

00:14.193 --> 00:15.205
You love them.

00:16.213 --> 00:19.165
I think he's off having sex
with Kate Parks.

00:19.166 --> 00:21.217
Then this new investor arrives,

00:21.218 --> 00:25.133
um, White Stone,
starts ploughing in cash.

00:25.134 --> 00:26.221
It's the Parks.

00:26.222 --> 00:29.158
Gemma, I can't. Why not?

00:31.142 --> 00:32.192
Oh, hi.

00:32.194 --> 00:34.198
Oh, God! You're not expecting us.

00:34.199 --> 00:37.202
We've got the kids in tonight.
It'll be fun!

00:37.202 --> 00:38.326
I'm really not... Come on!

00:38.336 --> 00:39.887
God, it's gorgeous!

00:43.170 --> 00:48.209
Yes, finished this six months ago.
I'll give you the grand tour.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.640
Oh!

00:49.641 --> 00:53.633
Susie finds it embarrassing
but I can't help it. I'm so proud!

00:53.634 --> 00:55.631
Do tell him to shut up
if you need to.

00:55.632 --> 00:57.691
You'll find this REALLY interesting.

00:57.692 --> 00:59.708
I'm just going to nip
in the kitchen.

00:59.708 --> 01:02.659
Give me a shout
if you lose the will to live.

01:02.660 --> 01:03.720
We can easily come back
in a week or...

01:03.720 --> 01:06.627
No, no! No, no, no. No, it's fine!

01:06.628 --> 01:08.948
Come on, let's go upstairs,
you get a better view. Come on.

01:10.664 --> 01:11.668
Yes!

01:14.628 --> 01:18.687
So, we used a new type of glass
on the back of the house.

01:18.688 --> 01:22.663
I don't understand the technology
but essentially,

01:22.664 --> 01:26.647
it's double height, thin
and stays hot.

01:26.648 --> 01:27.672
Like Naomi Campbell.

01:28.716 --> 01:30.663
A little joke.

01:30.664 --> 01:32.659
It's beautiful.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.655
Hope you don't mind me showing off?

01:34.656 --> 01:38.664
If you look at the end there,
you can see the pool. We loved

01:38.665 --> 01:44.636
the pool in our house in France so
much that we copied the dimensions.

01:44.636 --> 01:45.697
You have a place in France?

01:45.698 --> 01:48.703
Yeah. Well, you can go and stay
there if you like. Really?

01:48.704 --> 01:52.627
Yeah, we have a wonderful maid
called Angelique

01:52.628 --> 01:54.696
who sorts everything out.
What's it called?

01:54.697 --> 01:56.652
The house?

01:56.652 --> 01:57.707
Does it have a name?

01:57.708 --> 01:59.719
Pierre Blanche.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.624
What does it mean?

02:02.660 --> 02:03.683
Um...

02:03.684 --> 02:07.719
Wait! You haven't got any drinks!
I'm chatting away like an idiot.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.679
Would you like some wine?
White, if you have it?

02:10.680 --> 02:12.699
Of course. Beer, I assume? Beer?

02:12.700 --> 02:13.704
Yeah, cheers.

02:15.624 --> 02:19.656
Ah, Kate! You know the Fosters?
Gemma and Simon.

02:21.636 --> 02:23.639
Hi.
Yeah, they're staying for dinner.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.671
I thought next week?

02:24.672 --> 02:27.715
There's been a bit of a mix-up, so
it's happening now, which is nice.

02:27.716 --> 02:30.655
Just going to get some drinks.
Do you want one?

02:30.656 --> 02:32.648
I'll come with you. OK.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.644 --> 02:43.663
How could you get it wrong?

02:43.664 --> 02:44.711
She said next Thursday.

02:44.712 --> 02:47.643
That means
the Thursday of the following week!

02:47.644 --> 02:49.671
Oh, OK.

02:49.672 --> 02:52.699
It's just he's more of a colleague
than a friend.

02:52.700 --> 02:56.684
An important advisor for me,
a contact.

02:59.644 --> 03:00.699
I only see him
a couple of times a year

03:00.700 --> 03:03.655
so if you're going to organise
something like this,

03:03.656 --> 03:05.704
then it'd be nice to have
a bit more notice and...

03:07.720 --> 03:09.648
What... you...

03:10.696 --> 03:11.700
Oh...

03:11.700 --> 03:13.712
Yeah... Yes...

03:16.660 --> 03:18.648
Wine for the... Oh!

03:18.648 --> 03:22.663
Sorry, I knocked it with my... hand.

03:22.664 --> 03:27.643
Not to worry.
We'll just, er... This is for you.

03:27.644 --> 03:28.680
Yeah, and er... Kate!

03:28.680 --> 03:30.627
So sorry.

03:30.628 --> 03:31.715
It's not a problem.
Was it expensive?

03:31.716 --> 03:33.635
It doesn't matter.

03:33.636 --> 03:35.628
Come on, let's step outside.

03:35.628 --> 03:37.652
We can pay for it. Simon?

03:39.640 --> 03:41.655
Could you get the dustpan
and brush, please?

03:41.656 --> 03:44.623
That was Mum's.
Mm, yeah. It was an accident.

03:44.624 --> 03:48.668
Would you help me deal with this,
please? It's not a problem.

03:50.624 --> 03:51.679
All right!

03:51.680 --> 03:52.696
Cheers!

03:56.712 --> 04:00.623
So, you two have
known each other a while?

04:00.624 --> 04:03.651
Yeah, we meet occasionally.
I give him a few pearls of wisdom.

04:03.652 --> 04:07.672
But you've never been tempted
to go into business together?

04:08.676 --> 04:10.695
Er, no. I wish.

04:10.696 --> 04:15.671
Ah, he's on his way up, so he's
working all the hours, I expect.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.671
That's in the past for me now.
I'm living off the fat.

04:18.672 --> 04:21.642
I mean, obviously, a lot of my time
is spent at the council

04:21.644 --> 04:23.648
and, you know, we open
the odd new restaurant...

04:23.649 --> 04:24.667
How did it happen?

04:24.668 --> 04:27.628
You're interrupting me, darling.
How did it break?

04:28.628 --> 04:29.716
I knocked it.

04:29.716 --> 04:31.623
Mum's upset.

04:31.624 --> 04:34.632
Yeah, well, could happen to anyone.

04:45.212 --> 05:42.695
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

05:42.696 --> 05:46.639
I assume we can start?

05:46.640 --> 05:47.644
Please.

05:49.664 --> 05:50.695
Ah, at last!

05:50.696 --> 05:53.627
You remember Gemma
and Simon from the party?

05:53.628 --> 05:55.720
Hi. Shall we have music?
Please, God, no!

05:57.652 --> 06:00.696
We'll talk. Gemma, help yourself.

06:03.636 --> 06:05.695
That was quite a game yesterday.
On form.

06:05.696 --> 06:08.651
Good result, your boy did good.
Yeah.

06:08.652 --> 06:10.623
How's the restaurant?

06:10.624 --> 06:11.628
Um... good.

06:12.688 --> 06:14.647
You're a waitress, so that must be...

06:14.648 --> 06:15.728
It's for the money, mostly.

06:16.704 --> 06:19.699
Dad wants me to take over
as manager, but...

06:19.700 --> 06:22.655
I'm more interested
in going into events.

06:22.656 --> 06:26.636
I'm doing an internship
at a local company at the moment.

06:27.704 --> 06:29.711
Events. So that's...?

06:29.712 --> 06:31.711
Weddings. Right.

06:31.712 --> 06:33.691
Divorce parties.

06:33.692 --> 06:35.715
OK. Funerals.

06:35.716 --> 06:37.719
Is that really something people do?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.715
What, die?

06:39.716 --> 06:42.635
Divorce parties? Yeah!

06:42.636 --> 06:45.675
There you see all the ex-wives
having a great time

06:45.676 --> 06:49.676
and you realise some people are just
so much better off out of marriage.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.635
There's no point
staying in something

06:53.636 --> 06:56.696
if it's bad, if you're trapped.

06:59.668 --> 07:00.672
Right.

07:03.668 --> 07:04.692
How's your love life?

07:06.696 --> 07:08.635
That's a personal question.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.679
You talked before about a man
you were seeing?

07:10.680 --> 07:14.655
Sorry, isn't there a confidentiality
thing between doctors and patients?

07:14.656 --> 07:15.675
Yes.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.715
Can we activate that thing,
then, please?

07:17.716 --> 07:20.703
Oh, your mum and dad don't know?

07:20.704 --> 07:22.703
Don't know what?

07:22.704 --> 07:24.635
Oops.

07:24.636 --> 07:26.663
Nothing, Mum.

07:26.664 --> 07:29.631
Don't tell me you've got secrets?

07:29.632 --> 07:31.687
Course I have!
You said you prefer it that way.

07:31.688 --> 07:34.699
Well, while you're under my roof,
I don't want any big surprises.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.675
I'm still your mum!

07:36.676 --> 07:38.699
You live here?
We can't get rid of her!

07:38.700 --> 07:40.675
I lived on my own
and I didn't like it.

07:40.676 --> 07:41.716
Why? What changed?

07:43.648 --> 07:44.663
Wine?

07:44.664 --> 07:45.695
No, thanks.

07:45.696 --> 07:49.623
Susie? Mm. Yes, please.

07:49.624 --> 07:53.639
Gemma, actually, I wanted to say,
I had an appointment

07:53.640 --> 07:56.691
but then a letter came through
saying that you weren't available

07:56.692 --> 07:59.683
and I had a new doctor
and then Chris heard something...

07:59.684 --> 08:02.647
Yeah, a chap at the council
knows your administrator.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.663
There's been a formal complaint
made against me,

08:05.664 --> 08:08.679
a number of negative comments
online, so...

08:08.680 --> 08:11.683
Online. There's always trouble
when you hear that word.

08:11.684 --> 08:14.695
The GMC felt it wasn't appropriate
for me to stay working,

08:14.696 --> 08:18.719
so they've asked me to take some
time off pending an investigation.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.699
But you're the senior doctor.

08:20.700 --> 08:24.647
Well, what's the complaint?
Chris, you can't ask that!

08:24.648 --> 08:28.683
A man says I threatened to burn him
with a lit cigarette

08:28.684 --> 08:30.679
unless he left his girlfriend alone.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.655
He said you threatened him?

08:34.635 --> 08:37.687
Well, you've just got to pity some
people, haven't you? Fantasist.

08:37.688 --> 08:39.639
But why would he make that up?

08:39.640 --> 08:40.644
He didn't.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.691
He was beating up his girlfriend.
I thought she needed help.

08:44.692 --> 08:47.719
Oh! So you...

08:47.720 --> 08:49.624
Yeah.

08:50.628 --> 08:52.707
I've been under a lot of stress
recently... Right.

08:52.708 --> 08:57.655
..in my personal life.
It's clearly affected my work.

08:57.656 --> 08:59.707
It's not an excuse.
No, it's a reason.

08:59.708 --> 09:03.635
Come on, Kate! I mean, if the girl
was going to be beaten up...

09:03.636 --> 09:06.632
If the girl was being beaten up,
you call the police!

09:07.676 --> 09:11.668
Things have been tough lately,
have they? Yes. Yes, I'd say so.

09:12.676 --> 09:15.671
Are you listening? Stress.

09:15.672 --> 09:17.687
Andrew said he wants to be a doctor.
No, I don't.

09:17.688 --> 09:20.667
The stress is more at home, actually.

09:20.668 --> 09:23.623
You must work all hours, Chris,
to stay on top of everything.

09:23.624 --> 09:25.675
I know you said you take it easy...
Simon?

09:25.676 --> 09:26.699
..but there must be times...

09:26.700 --> 09:29.631
You don't mind me saying
about the problems we've had?

09:29.632 --> 09:30.663
I... What?

09:30.664 --> 09:34.679
You don't mind me opening up about
the difficulties we've experienced?

09:34.680 --> 09:35.683
Difficulties?

09:35.684 --> 09:38.643
All right, not difficulties.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.699
That's a euphemism, I suppose,
as we're in company.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.700
But, OK, good. Let's be precise.
Not difficulties.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.703
Betrayals.

09:47.704 --> 09:50.623
OK?

09:50.624 --> 09:53.647
I know we haven't talked about it
with each other, but...

09:53.648 --> 09:55.699
we both know what's been going on,
don't we?

09:55.700 --> 09:59.672
Gemma, are you...
Do you want me to spell it out?

10:00.680 --> 10:02.695
If there's really something
we need talk through,

10:02.696 --> 10:05.651
then I don't think this is...
For the last two years,

10:05.652 --> 10:08.671
Simon's been secretly
having sex with another woman.

10:08.672 --> 10:11.656
Well, more of a girl, really.

10:13.648 --> 10:15.715
I know we haven't spoken about it,
but these are our friends

10:15.716 --> 10:17.664
and I want to be honest.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.695
You haven't talked about this
until now?

10:21.696 --> 10:24.711
I think this is a joke!
That's a lie.

10:24.712 --> 10:27.635
Sometimes she says these things
to get a reaction

10:27.636 --> 10:29.695
but I've no idea what she's talking
about. He's lying now. See?

10:29.696 --> 10:32.667
Maybe we should call it a night.
Is that OK? Mm-hm.

10:32.668 --> 10:34.687
Pierre Blanche. What?

10:34.688 --> 10:38.651
Pierre Blanche means White Stone.

10:38.652 --> 10:41.659
Simon, isn't that the name
of your main investor?

10:41.660 --> 10:44.675
I thought that you said that you two
didn't do business together?

10:44.676 --> 10:45.679
It's confidential.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.631
Simon has this big project
called Academy Green.

10:49.632 --> 10:52.719
He couldn't raise any money so it
ended up being entirely bank-rolled

10:52.720 --> 10:55.711
by this single mystery company
with an enigmatic title.

10:55.712 --> 10:58.643
White Stone. And now it makes sense.

10:58.644 --> 10:59.699
What do you mean bank-rolled?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.668
Dad has put in nearly all the money.

11:03.672 --> 11:06.675
Oh, wait.
You don't know?

11:06.676 --> 11:09.675
That's interesting.

11:09.676 --> 11:12.675
You two are obviously
in the middle of something...

11:12.676 --> 11:16.695
Simon said ages ago that he had
a friend on the local council

11:16.696 --> 11:18.667
who helped him secure the site,

11:18.668 --> 11:21.647
pulled some strings. So that
must have been you? I didn't...

11:21.648 --> 11:23.651
Chris, yes, you boasted about it.

11:23.652 --> 11:26.655
It's illegal if you're investing
in the project yourself.

11:26.656 --> 11:27.683
It's a conflict of interest.

11:27.684 --> 11:30.627
You're in business with Dad?

11:30.628 --> 11:31.712
Why didn't you tell me?

11:35.700 --> 11:38.623
Gemma...
Is there something I don't know?

11:38.624 --> 11:39.648
Tell them.

11:46.716 --> 11:48.703
Chris, Susie...

11:48.704 --> 11:52.687
Actually no, you've had two years.
I'll do it.

11:52.688 --> 11:56.691
Susie, you'll notice
that Kate looks quite unhappy.

11:56.692 --> 11:58.635
It's OK.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.687
You're a fucking bitch!
Bitch is right.

12:00.688 --> 12:02.668
I'm a wolf tonight!

12:04.632 --> 12:05.671
You mean you've been...

12:05.672 --> 12:08.699
Sorry, Susie, but your daughter's
not a little girl any more.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.703
You can ask my husband.

12:10.704 --> 12:12.655
He likes blow jobs, apparently,

12:12.656 --> 12:15.639
and I'm told she really knows what
she's doing. Get out! Get out now!

12:15.640 --> 12:16.663
No, there's more. No, no!

12:16.664 --> 12:18.623
Don't. Do you want to do it or...

12:18.624 --> 12:22.663
Go on, then! You'll break
all your rules of confidentiality

12:22.664 --> 12:25.687
and tell my parents the most
personal thing in my life!

12:25.688 --> 12:28.671
Kate got pregnant with Simon's child

12:28.672 --> 12:33.628
and because he messed her around
so much, she had it aborted.

12:42.688 --> 12:43.692
OK.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.624
OK.

12:49.648 --> 12:51.668
You ancient fucking cunt!

12:52.716 --> 12:54.708
No... Get her out!

13:32.632 --> 13:34.695
What the fuck was that?
I wasn't ill at your party.

13:34.696 --> 13:38.679
What? I found your other phone
in the boot of your car.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.684
Oh, Jesus! OK.

13:40.716 --> 13:43.696
So, you've known since...
Are you coming back with me?

13:44.700 --> 13:47.716
We need to talk. Of course not.
I've got to sort this out.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.652
It's just that's where our son lives.

13:53.668 --> 13:57.652
Simon, they have literally closed
the door on you. They hate you.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.715
I'm assuming that
you didn't tell them

14:01.716 --> 14:03.679
in case Chris withdrew the funding.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.683
Yeah, and if I had, we'd be
bankrupt. You want the truth?

14:06.684 --> 14:08.639
Everything we have...

14:08.640 --> 14:11.667
Is invested in Academy Green.
Yeah, I know. Neil said.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.720
He wouldn't.
Just after we slept together.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.736
He was all right, actually.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.684
I wouldn't sell tickets
but we had a good time.

14:25.668 --> 14:27.628
You wanted to get back at me.

14:28.648 --> 14:29.712
Is it sinking in?

14:30.716 --> 14:32.688
Have you felt it yet?

14:38.636 --> 14:39.640
No.

14:40.696 --> 14:41.700
But you will.

14:44.624 --> 14:45.628
How was Kate?

14:46.628 --> 14:48.948
I mean, the things she must be able
to do with that tongue.

14:50.656 --> 14:51.679
How was Neil?

14:51.680 --> 14:54.720
I came, hard, once.

14:56.704 --> 14:59.664
He's slightly bigger than you
but not as good.

15:01.636 --> 15:02.679
Gemma, I made a mistake

15:02.680 --> 15:05.708
but it wasn't about sex.
I didn't want this to happen.

15:06.720 --> 15:11.679
I know you won't believe me, but
when I met Kate, we just sparked.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.655
I had to find out what it was.

15:13.656 --> 15:14.675
So, helpless?

15:14.676 --> 15:17.667
And yes, I didn't want Chris
to find out because of the money

15:17.668 --> 15:20.683
but that wasn't the main reason
I didn't tell you. Selfish? Nasty?

15:20.684 --> 15:26.647
It's because I still love you.
Despite all this, I do.

15:26.648 --> 15:27.712
Just shut up and listen.

15:29.644 --> 15:32.712
We will NEVER
have a relationship again.

15:34.696 --> 15:36.683
Now, here's what I want.

15:36.684 --> 15:39.671
Leave me and Tom living in our house

15:39.672 --> 15:43.659
and go away somewhere else,
start again.

15:43.660 --> 15:46.692
No. No, I'm not moving.

15:48.676 --> 15:49.704
We can't stay here.

15:51.668 --> 15:54.639
We can go to the house.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.880
Most of my stuff's still there.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.643
Please, Kate. Please, stop.

15:58.644 --> 16:00.672
Tom will want to know
what's happening.

16:03.664 --> 16:05.703
You know, I used to feel
sorry for you!

16:05.704 --> 16:09.656
I've always said he should tell you
the truth. Now I get why he didn't.

16:10.692 --> 16:12.715
Why is it women go mad
when they get old?

16:12.716 --> 16:14.703
You're still pregnant.

16:14.704 --> 16:17.696
You didn't drink wine at the table.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.632
You didn't have the abortion.

16:23.696 --> 16:28.656
She was testing you to see
if you wanted her or just the baby.

16:32.672 --> 16:35.684
And you passed, went back.

16:36.716 --> 16:37.720
Well done.

16:39.716 --> 16:41.668
Really?

16:43.636 --> 16:44.652
Yeah.

16:59.696 --> 17:01.688
Please don't tell Tom.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.695
Not yet.

18:02.644 --> 18:03.648
Hello!

18:07.676 --> 18:09.651
Everything all right?

18:09.652 --> 18:11.680
Are you going to invite me in?

18:14.624 --> 18:15.707
I recognise that voice!

18:15.708 --> 18:17.668
Hey, hello!

18:19.708 --> 18:22.644
Are you coming in? Thanks.

18:30.644 --> 18:32.647
Can I get you anything? No.

18:32.648 --> 18:36.664
So, to what do we owe this pleasure?
How did you know about it?

18:37.680 --> 18:39.656
I'm sorry? What we did?

18:40.680 --> 18:42.672
Did you check his text messages?

18:44.688 --> 18:48.636
He can't have been stupid enough
to have left them on his phone.

18:55.696 --> 18:57.667
He strays...

18:57.668 --> 18:59.675
which I accept.

18:59.676 --> 19:02.651
As long as I have knowledge of
where...

19:02.652 --> 19:03.708
You are... and who.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.627
Sometimes I follow him
to check who's he's meeting.

19:07.628 --> 19:09.679
Normally, it's women I've never met.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.711
Don't care about.

19:11.712 --> 19:13.652
Until you.

19:14.668 --> 19:17.635
Never one of our friends before...
Anna, I'm s...

19:17.636 --> 19:19.672
Not in front of her.

19:21.668 --> 19:25.624
How did you find out about Simon?
Did he tell you?

19:26.660 --> 19:28.715
No. We ran into him with Kate,
in London.

19:28.716 --> 19:33.647
It was awkward at first,
but actually, we got on,

19:33.648 --> 19:36.719
ended up having a drink. And we were
very clear, from the beginning.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.631
His marriage is not our business.
We stay out.

19:40.632 --> 19:42.624
Was it that hair of hers you found?

19:43.628 --> 19:45.695
Yeah. I thought that might
start things off.

19:45.696 --> 19:48.683
So, you knew when we were...?
Yeah.

19:48.684 --> 19:51.683
That's why she felt able to.
You're really clever, aren't you?

19:51.684 --> 19:54.679
I'm not a doctor, but I do all
right. Why didn't we ever get on?

19:54.680 --> 19:56.648
You're joking?

20:00.628 --> 20:03.643
You know, Neil and I might not
be perfect,

20:03.644 --> 20:05.711
but we know what the other one
needs. We function.

20:05.712 --> 20:07.651
We don't talk about what he does.

20:07.652 --> 20:09.679
Until now, thanks to you.

20:09.680 --> 20:13.664
But you and Simon, you don't
know each other at all. Never have.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.659
And why the comments?

20:22.660 --> 20:23.683
What comments?

20:23.684 --> 20:25.624
The night that we met up...

20:26.692 --> 20:30.687
..someone started to put
negative comments about me online.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.712
It took me till just now,
standing out there...

20:34.720 --> 20:36.668
..to work out who it was.

20:38.652 --> 20:41.639
Who would have the time?
The reason to do it?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.671
God, you have no idea
how you come across.

20:43.672 --> 20:46.663
What people say about you
when you leave the room.

20:46.664 --> 20:48.691
They breathe a sigh of relief.

20:48.692 --> 20:50.703
Because I don't know if you mean to,

20:50.704 --> 20:53.655
but you make them feel inadequate,

20:53.656 --> 20:55.655
and even though
you say you like them,

20:55.656 --> 20:58.660
it's clear you think
you're very slightly better.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.660
Better than all of us.

21:03.648 --> 21:06.660
Those stories I put online,
they may be made up...

21:07.668 --> 21:10.632
..but what they're saying
is all true.

21:11.652 --> 21:12.695
Delete them.

21:12.696 --> 21:14.628
Sure.

21:15.668 --> 21:18.656
But that's not WHY she came round.

21:19.668 --> 21:22.651
Is it? So, I'd remove the messages.

21:22.652 --> 21:24.671
You came here tonight
to reveal your secret.

21:24.672 --> 21:26.687
Break us up, maybe.

21:26.688 --> 21:27.692
But, look.

21:29.660 --> 21:30.688
We're still together.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.676
Aren't we?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.640
Yeah.

21:49.672 --> 21:50.676
Thanks.

22:03.696 --> 22:05.703
Hey. How was it?

22:05.704 --> 22:08.679
Has anyone called?
Here? Tonight? No.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.675
OK. Well...

22:10.676 --> 22:12.676
He's not here, that's how it went.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.683
Where did you go? For dinner.

22:16.684 --> 22:19.640
So, is he staying with her?

22:20.672 --> 22:23.667
How's Tom been? Er, we watched TV

22:23.668 --> 22:25.636
and then he went to bed.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.660
He's asleep now, I think.

22:31.712 --> 22:33.719
Isobel? Come on, love.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.652
It's time to go home,
grab my stuff, will you?

22:41.636 --> 22:42.836
I'll... just... leave you to it.

22:46.632 --> 22:47.648
Come on.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.632
I'm sorry.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.624
You like secrets, don't you?

23:57.628 --> 23:58.684
I'm not the only one.

24:02.672 --> 24:03.704
I want to keep it.

24:07.668 --> 24:08.707
OK.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.688
Do you?

24:11.712 --> 24:13.676
Yeah.

24:21.664 --> 24:23.655
I could talk to Dad this morning.

24:23.656 --> 24:26.715
Explain. Get him to keep
the funding going, right?

24:26.716 --> 24:28.671
That's what we need.

24:28.672 --> 24:29.720
If you think you can.

24:54.644 --> 24:55.687
Who are you?

24:55.688 --> 24:57.635
I'm, um...

24:57.636 --> 24:58.691
Er, you're...

24:58.692 --> 25:00.691
Is my dad here?

25:00.692 --> 25:03.683
Um, he... Yeah.

25:03.684 --> 25:04.716
Yeah, come in.

25:10.716 --> 25:12.680
Simon!

25:13.708 --> 25:15.664
It's your son.

25:24.712 --> 25:27.699
Hey, mate, what are you...?

25:27.700 --> 25:30.667
Mum said that she had
some stuff to do,

25:30.668 --> 25:33.719
but that you'd be here,
and you'd take me to school.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.664
What's going on?
Yeah, OK... I can take you.

25:38.668 --> 25:41.683
Who's she? This is my friend, Kate.

25:41.684 --> 25:43.628
Your "friend"?

25:44.668 --> 25:47.692
Mum and me had a row,
Kate let me stay in the spare room.

25:48.692 --> 25:50.700
How old are you? 23.

25:53.672 --> 25:57.663
Are you having sex with each other?
What?! Tom...!

25:57.664 --> 25:58.684
Don't lie to me.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.691
Mate, listen.

26:01.692 --> 26:02.716
Kate's just a friend.

26:03.716 --> 26:05.672
Promise. Yeah?

26:06.712 --> 26:12.640
Now, you stay here, I'll get my
stuff, take you in, OK? Two minutes.

26:13.684 --> 26:15.636
We'll have to take your car.

26:17.712 --> 26:19.691
You're Andrew Parks's sister.

26:19.692 --> 26:21.635
Yeah.

26:21.636 --> 26:24.699
At the football,
some of them fancied you. OK.

26:24.700 --> 26:28.675
But then your brother said they
shouldn't because you're a slut

26:28.676 --> 26:32.647
and have sex with loads of people
all the time.

26:32.648 --> 26:35.683
Andrew doesn't like me very much.
He makes things up.

26:35.684 --> 26:38.704
Is it... true, though? It...

26:42.648 --> 26:44.680
Women can have as much sex
as they like, Tom.

26:45.696 --> 26:48.696
Just like men.
Not with Dad though!

26:51.660 --> 26:53.632
He just told you.

26:54.672 --> 26:56.640
We're good... friends.

26:57.712 --> 26:59.668
OK?

27:26.692 --> 27:29.652
I can drop you by the gate.
No, thanks.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.696
Adam!

27:34.684 --> 27:36.648
We need to sort this out.

28:35.632 --> 28:37.656
You don't have to ring the bell.

28:53.692 --> 28:56.636
Where's Mum? Migraine.

28:57.712 --> 29:01.699
So, what did he do first? Get my
money or sleep with my daughter?

29:01.700 --> 29:03.664
We met at that networking event...

29:04.696 --> 29:06.703
..when I was doing the drinks.

29:06.704 --> 29:10.643
We talked, we got on. He was
using you to get to me. Dad...

29:10.644 --> 29:13.711
He didn't tell you we were working
together. He was protecting me.

29:13.712 --> 29:17.679
Right.
Well, whatever he said to you,

29:17.680 --> 29:19.719
he's very bad at business.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.687
At first, I thought
he was onto something,

29:22.688 --> 29:24.687
but then the further we got,

29:24.688 --> 29:28.635
I started smelling... bullshit.

29:28.636 --> 29:29.711
He's been unlucky.

29:29.712 --> 29:31.720
Sweetheart, that is naive,

29:33.632 --> 29:37.631
He's been incredibly lucky, but he's
messed it up every step of the way.

29:37.632 --> 29:40.647
Well, you have to keep going. With him?
Giving him money? I don't think so.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.691
Dad, the only reason
he took so long to tell you...

29:42.692 --> 29:45.652
He didn't tell me. His wife did!
Let me finish!

29:46.652 --> 29:49.708
He didn't want to leave her and Tom
with nothing. Oh, God...

29:54.672 --> 29:57.667
You think I haven't looked
at another women since I married?

29:57.668 --> 29:58.688
I have.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.660
Course I have.

30:02.684 --> 30:04.715
Yeah, I work hard

30:04.716 --> 30:07.623
to fulfil the promise for your mum.

30:07.624 --> 30:09.688
Yeah, well, you're amazing,
as always!

30:12.704 --> 30:14.639
Fine,

30:14.640 --> 30:16.676
don't help him, then.

30:17.704 --> 30:19.660
Do it for me.

30:23.640 --> 30:24.691
You made a mistake.

30:24.692 --> 30:28.640
You're an adult
and there are consequences.

30:46.716 --> 30:49.652
You're not even going to hug me.

30:51.656 --> 30:53.631
Course I am. Come here.

30:53.632 --> 30:54.711
Come here.

30:54.712 --> 30:56.688
Mm.

31:03.652 --> 31:04.676
Dad? Mmm...

31:12.632 --> 31:14.644
I'm still pregnant.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.720
You can't just walk away from him.

31:28.644 --> 31:29.672
All right.

31:31.672 --> 31:34.631
All right.
We'll look after you and the child.

31:34.632 --> 31:36.683
You have a room here if you need it.

31:36.684 --> 31:39.692
You can always come back
if you need to. Always.

31:40.692 --> 31:43.632
But he's getting
no more money from me.

31:44.668 --> 31:45.708
Ever.

32:12.708 --> 32:14.644
That do it for you?

32:21.692 --> 32:24.667
How do I know
you won't say anything?

32:24.668 --> 32:26.684
We actually want the same thing.

32:30.684 --> 32:32.660
What are you going to do now?

32:49.656 --> 32:50.660
Hey!

32:52.648 --> 32:55.635
You're here to see Ros? Yeah.

32:55.636 --> 32:57.716
Gemma, you should know,
before you got here... Hi.

32:59.644 --> 33:00.684
Want to come with me?

33:05.656 --> 33:07.707
There is still
the outstanding complaint.

33:07.708 --> 33:09.679
All doctors get complaints.

33:09.680 --> 33:13.719
And as I said on the phone, there
is no reason I can't come back.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.636
I thought we'd go somewhere
more private.

33:31.692 --> 33:34.703
Um, Simon called me
just after you did.

33:34.704 --> 33:36.683
He told me what happened last night,

33:36.684 --> 33:39.691
and I thought perhaps
the best thing would be for you

33:39.692 --> 33:43.643
to speak somewhere more neutral,
to work this out.

33:43.644 --> 33:45.668
So no-one else is caught up
in the middle.

33:47.696 --> 33:51.632
I'll be around if you need me.
Thanks.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.687
Kate says her dad won't help.

34:07.688 --> 34:09.683
He's going to cut me out.

34:09.684 --> 34:11.715
I assume you'd...

34:11.716 --> 34:14.635
spoken already?

34:14.636 --> 34:18.623
If he didn't do what you wanted
you'd go to the council...

34:19.668 --> 34:22.672
..tell them about the conflict
of interest. Yeah.

34:23.699 --> 34:26.630
He's going to give the project
to a new developer.

34:26.632 --> 34:31.627
And then, when it's finished and
sold, he'll pay me back every penny.

34:31.628 --> 34:33.719
In the meantime,
he'll cover my expenses.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.664
I'll keep the house.

34:36.696 --> 34:38.655
Get the savings back.

34:38.656 --> 34:40.690
It's my project. I did all the work.

34:40.692 --> 34:43.652
You're not as good-looking
as you think.

34:45.676 --> 34:48.663
What was that, this morning?
Leaving Tom on the doorstep.

34:48.664 --> 34:51.635
Did you tell him? It's not fair,
putting him in that position.

34:51.636 --> 34:53.627
He has a right to hear the truth.

34:53.628 --> 34:56.627
I THOUGHT that you would want
to do that yourself,

34:56.628 --> 34:59.660
but, fine, you've had your chance.

35:03.656 --> 35:06.643
Please, can we just try to...
Either you leave,

35:06.644 --> 35:09.668
or I tell the police that you forged
my signature on the mortgage.

35:13.648 --> 35:16.631
What are you doing?
I bought all your clothes.

35:16.632 --> 35:18.663
In fact, anything
from the last two years

35:18.664 --> 35:22.632
came out of money that I earned.
You can't argue with that. This.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.656
Your car's mine. And this.

35:28.652 --> 35:30.683
I'm not leaving.
Kate doesn't want to.

35:30.684 --> 35:32.631
And I can't live far from Tom

35:32.632 --> 35:35.651
so we're just going to have
to start to talk. You have to leave.

35:35.652 --> 35:37.704
I'm not going anywhere. Simon...

35:39.720 --> 35:42.700
Gemma...
What? You've got another one.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.712
Gemma, can we speak to you?

35:57.632 --> 35:58.664
No.

35:59.668 --> 36:02.675
Simon explained what happened
this morning with Tom,

36:02.676 --> 36:05.659
and I can see that you're...
I called Martha,

36:05.660 --> 36:08.664
asked her to come and see you.
Hi, Gemma.

36:09.676 --> 36:10.687
Why?

36:10.688 --> 36:14.683
I really think the best thing
for us all would be to...

36:14.684 --> 36:17.719
I just want a word.
Before you do something you regret.

36:17.720 --> 36:21.675
We think it'd be really good for you
to see somebody that's not us,

36:21.676 --> 36:24.675
that you trust... I don't know what
happened with Tom this morning

36:24.676 --> 36:27.672
but when he, he was there on
the doorstep, he looked terrified.

36:29.660 --> 36:31.667
You...

36:31.668 --> 36:32.692
Tom?

36:39.656 --> 36:41.704
Why are you talking about Tom?

36:43.632 --> 36:45.632
Is that why you won't...?

36:51.676 --> 36:53.683
Are you going stop me from leaving?

36:53.684 --> 36:55.716
Of course not, Gemma. Move!

36:57.716 --> 36:59.660
Gemma!

37:02.688 --> 37:03.720
Gemma!

37:09.632 --> 37:10.687
Doctor Foster!

37:10.688 --> 37:13.715
Poppy, the doctor's busy!
They took it off, look!

37:13.716 --> 37:16.695
That's good,
but you have to be careful.

37:16.696 --> 37:18.700
It's better, but it's not quite...

37:18.701 --> 37:21.660
# Doctor Foster went
to Gloucester... # No!

37:24.700 --> 37:28.688
No, Poppy, it's not Doctor Foster
any more. I'm getting divorced.

37:29.712 --> 37:33.659
And changing my name is what
you'd call a "silver lining".

37:33.660 --> 37:34.703
Gemma...

37:34.704 --> 37:36.660
Bye.

37:37.660 --> 37:38.663
Stop.

37:38.664 --> 37:39.687
And think.

37:39.688 --> 37:42.695
Work this out,
before it all gets worse.

37:42.696 --> 37:45.652
Do you want your car keys?

37:46.688 --> 37:48.680
What? Fetch.

38:02.720 --> 38:05.703
I've just had a call
from your husband.

38:05.704 --> 38:07.687
He requested
that I didn't release Tom.

38:07.688 --> 38:09.699
My husband and I aren't together
any more.

38:09.700 --> 38:11.655
So, unless you honestly think

38:11.656 --> 38:13.715
there's a safeguarding issue,
or that I'm drunk,

38:13.716 --> 38:17.687
or mentally unwell,
or an urgent danger to my son,

38:17.688 --> 38:19.680
then you have to let me take him.

38:21.628 --> 38:22.656
Right now.

39:02.700 --> 39:03.720
Is she here?

39:22.672 --> 39:26.627
You say I have to go and knock
on a door, cos that's where Dad is,

39:26.628 --> 39:28.623
and as soon as it's opened
you drive off.

39:28.624 --> 39:31.635
Inside there's that girl.

39:31.636 --> 39:33.635
Everyone's saying she's a slut.

39:33.636 --> 39:36.691
Don't use words like that.
She is though, I'm not stupid!

39:36.692 --> 39:38.668
I can guess what's happening...

39:39.684 --> 39:41.672
..but you don't tell me anything.

39:44.672 --> 39:47.628
If you don't,
I'm going to open the door!

39:48.708 --> 39:50.692
OK.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.644
Where are we going?

40:13.704 --> 40:15.679
What are you doing?

40:15.680 --> 40:16.720
You wanted to stop.

40:26.712 --> 40:29.624
So, what do you think's going on?

40:30.700 --> 40:34.624
Other families, they spend time
together.

40:35.628 --> 40:36.699
You get in so late,

40:36.700 --> 40:40.703
I want to talk to you, but then,
you just say you're so tired.

40:40.704 --> 40:45.655
Other mums,
they do things for their children,

40:45.656 --> 40:49.679
packed lunches, take them places...
I do all those things...

40:49.680 --> 40:53.652
..buy them new clothes at
the weekend. And they love the dads.

40:54.652 --> 40:56.667
You just work.

40:56.668 --> 40:58.624
You work all the time.

40:59.716 --> 41:01.675
So, I think dad got sick of it

41:01.676 --> 41:04.627
and went to have sex
with that other girl.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.691
And now, you both hate each other
and want to get a divorce.

41:06.692 --> 41:09.683
You think it's my fault?
Dad has fun with me.

41:09.684 --> 41:13.643
We do stuff. He's THERE! He has
time. He doesn't earn the money.

41:13.644 --> 41:15.644
It's not all about money, Mum!

41:19.628 --> 41:20.675
You like Dad?

41:20.676 --> 41:21.700
Yeah.

41:23.668 --> 41:24.720
You don't like me?

41:31.632 --> 41:32.636
No.

41:33.676 --> 41:35.644
Not at the moment.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.668
See, you're not even talking
to me now.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.719
You're just ignoring me!

42:00.720 --> 42:03.667
You know, you're supposed
to spend time with your family?

42:03.668 --> 42:07.675
Not just think about yourself...
or work...

42:07.676 --> 42:08.704
To do what you want to...

42:13.692 --> 42:15.632
What are you doing?

42:16.716 --> 42:17.720
Mum!

42:21.696 --> 42:24.667
..I tried everyone. She didn't
say anything to anyone at school

42:24.668 --> 42:27.675
about where she was going
so I haven't got a clue where...

42:27.676 --> 42:30.687
Yeah... Yeah, she's got him,
but I don't...

42:30.688 --> 42:31.720
OK.

42:33.672 --> 42:34.700
She's here.

42:38.664 --> 42:39.688
Where's Tom?

42:44.676 --> 42:45.704
Where is he?

42:47.684 --> 42:51.651
Becky's. Becky's at work.
Not any more. So, if I call her...

42:51.652 --> 42:53.667
Do you remember
when we went to Devon?

42:53.668 --> 42:57.651
When Tom was about three,
and we went to that causeway

42:57.652 --> 42:59.707
to get to the island,
and on the way back,

42:59.708 --> 43:01.711
the tide had started to come in,

43:01.712 --> 43:04.643
but you said, "Let's do it anyway,"

43:04.644 --> 43:07.623
and you lifted him up
onto your shoulders,

43:07.624 --> 43:10.640
and held my hand
and paddled through the water.

43:11.660 --> 43:12.664
That was fun.

43:14.696 --> 43:16.672
You destroyed it all.

43:18.672 --> 43:22.627
I wasted 14 years of my life when
I could've been with someone better.

43:22.628 --> 43:24.663
Who do I go to for justice?

43:24.664 --> 43:26.639
To make this fair.

43:26.640 --> 43:29.639
I honestly thought if I could
just get us in a position

43:29.640 --> 43:33.636
where we had money, and Tom was
a bit older... You are so stupid.

43:34.656 --> 43:35.684
OK, well...

43:36.716 --> 43:38.656
Maybe my mistake was...

43:39.692 --> 43:42.719
..even trying, maybe I should've
come to you straightaway,

43:42.720 --> 43:47.644
said, "I know we're married,
but I'm fucking someone else."

43:48.716 --> 43:50.719
Why did you do it?
I still don't understand.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.715
Because we're all animals,

43:53.716 --> 43:57.623
sometimes we can't control
our biology.

43:57.624 --> 43:59.659
We fall in love when we shouldn't,

43:59.660 --> 44:01.687
we have sex with the wrong people.

44:01.688 --> 44:03.639
I'm sick of saying sorry

44:03.640 --> 44:06.679
cos it happens to people
all over the world, all the time,

44:06.680 --> 44:09.647
people just deal with it,
this kind of thing happens a lot.

44:09.648 --> 44:11.667
You haven't. What?

44:11.668 --> 44:13.708
You've never said sorry.

44:15.632 --> 44:17.652
'Hi.' Becky, it's me.
Is Tom there?

44:19.676 --> 44:21.628
Gemma said he's with you.

44:26.628 --> 44:27.700
OK.

44:31.652 --> 44:33.652
Where is he?

44:35.720 --> 44:38.663
Neil said that all men cheat.

44:38.664 --> 44:41.715
It's just that most of them
get away with it. Is that true?

44:41.716 --> 44:45.643
Where's Tom? You've taken
everything away from me -

44:45.644 --> 44:47.631
my respect,

44:47.632 --> 44:49.635
my job,

44:49.636 --> 44:50.664
money.

44:51.660 --> 44:53.688
So, could it be after all that,
when...

44:55.648 --> 44:57.699
..you made everyone
think that I was mad

44:57.700 --> 45:01.691
so that I'll be removed from my son.
What's that?

45:01.692 --> 45:03.655
His hair.

45:03.656 --> 45:05.659
It... came off in my hand.

45:05.660 --> 45:08.719
Could it be that I decided

45:08.720 --> 45:13.644
that I'd rather do something
to protect him...

45:14.656 --> 45:18.695
..from having to grow up to be
someone like you? What do you mean?

45:18.696 --> 45:21.651
Because if it's true
that all men are entirely led

45:21.652 --> 45:23.719
by the desire
to FUCK anything they want,

45:23.720 --> 45:26.720
then why would I want him
to grow up to be like that?

45:29.636 --> 45:32.679
Everyone will ask,
"Who made her do it?

45:32.680 --> 45:34.703
"How was this allowed to happen?"

45:34.704 --> 45:37.671
And where were the neighbours
and the friends?

45:37.672 --> 45:41.655
It'll be the only thing
that this town is known for.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.644
Maybe I am mad...

45:47.676 --> 45:49.679
You really think
that I could do that?

45:49.680 --> 45:51.624
I...I don't know.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.648
Exactly.

45:55.640 --> 45:59.644
Simon, he's so beautiful,
and you don't deserve him.

46:05.704 --> 46:07.699
Shit...

46:07.700 --> 46:09.628
Should...

46:11.668 --> 46:15.696
Through all of this, you've had that
look like you're about to smile...

46:17.684 --> 46:19.635
..even when things were serious,

46:19.636 --> 46:22.627
I don't think you
ever got what you did.

46:22.628 --> 46:23.748
The horror of losing it all.

46:24.692 --> 46:27.712
And when you slept with her, you
killed the person that I loved...

46:29.644 --> 46:31.635
..and the son
that I was going to bring up.

46:31.636 --> 46:33.676
And the me
that I was starting to like!

46:35.644 --> 46:39.624
Everything that I wanted
and worked for, loved...

46:40.700 --> 46:42.672
..died.

46:56.656 --> 46:57.699
Oh, God!

46:57.700 --> 46:59.660
Oh...

47:04.628 --> 47:06.671
Mate, please...!

47:06.672 --> 47:07.716
Mate?

47:09.644 --> 47:11.691
Mum said that she had
to spend time with you.

47:11.692 --> 47:13.671
I had to wait with her friend Carly.

47:13.672 --> 47:16.667
OK, well, your mum and me,
we have to have a conversation

47:16.668 --> 47:18.691
about a lot of things,
so maybe the best thing...

47:18.692 --> 47:21.683
Mum says that you had sex
with Kate Parks for two years

47:21.684 --> 47:23.627
and hid it from her and me.

47:23.628 --> 47:25.684
That you spent all of our money!

47:27.704 --> 47:29.660
Is that true?

47:39.624 --> 47:40.676
Yeah. I... yeah.

47:42.664 --> 47:43.719
Yeah.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.652
I'm sorry.

47:47.704 --> 47:49.647
I'm sorry.

47:49.648 --> 47:50.671
I'm so sorry.

47:50.672 --> 47:51.684
Why?

47:59.720 --> 48:02.623
I didn't want
to tell him like that.

48:02.624 --> 48:05.675
Then you should've been better.
I thought he was dead!

48:05.676 --> 48:08.636
You made me think...

48:09.656 --> 48:10.704
It's my hair.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.640
It smells of him. I smell of him.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.692
Agh! This is it.

48:23.704 --> 48:26.623
This is what it felt like.

48:26.624 --> 48:27.719
Now you understand.

48:27.720 --> 48:29.680
He's my son!

48:31.636 --> 48:33.672
He's... my... son!

48:40.668 --> 48:42.672
Shit.

48:44.712 --> 48:46.664
What are you...?

48:47.720 --> 48:49.688
You know them?

48:50.708 --> 48:54.636
What's happened? What do you mean?
He just called me!

49:09.628 --> 49:11.632
I hit her...

49:13.656 --> 49:14.816
Have you called an ambulance?

49:16.696 --> 49:18.632
No.

49:21.684 --> 49:25.639
Is she all right?
Just stand outside. Both of you.

49:25.640 --> 49:29.639
Where's Tom? Upstairs. I told him to
stay there. I'll stop him coming in.

49:29.640 --> 49:32.656
And call an ambulance.
And the police. What?

49:34.668 --> 49:35.704
Call the police, as well.

49:36.716 --> 49:38.719
All right, it's all right.

49:38.720 --> 49:41.707
Can you sit up? Come on, you're
going to be all right. Come on.

49:41.708 --> 49:43.679
..No, no, no, listen to me,
listen to me.

49:43.680 --> 49:46.631
You need to stay upstairs
for a second. What's happened?

49:46.632 --> 49:48.655
Mum's had a little accident,
Tom... Tom!

49:48.656 --> 49:51.627
Get off!

49:51.628 --> 49:53.664
Where's Tom?
What happened?

49:57.708 --> 49:59.719
Tom, it's all right, love.

49:59.720 --> 50:03.676
It's all right, it's all right,
she's going to be fine.

51:26.692 --> 51:28.648
Ready to go?

51:29.704 --> 51:30.716
Yeah.

52:08.712 --> 52:11.668
He's withdrawn the complaint.

52:13.712 --> 52:15.664
No reason not to come back.

52:16.692 --> 52:18.660
And I don't like being in charge.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.656
Can't do the spreadsheets!

52:25.656 --> 52:26.684
You should have this.

52:27.680 --> 52:29.627
Don't want any confusion.

52:29.628 --> 52:31.636
Keep it. Just for a while.
See how you feel.

52:33.712 --> 52:35.624
Gemma...

52:37.660 --> 52:38.708
Sorry.

52:39.716 --> 52:42.708
I just didn't want to hurt anyone.

53:31.628 --> 53:33.704
How are you? Good.

53:35.652 --> 53:37.632
We're moving to London.

53:38.656 --> 53:40.720
Simon wanted you to know,
but obviously...

53:40.720 --> 53:42.668
he's not allowed to call, so...

53:44.644 --> 53:46.684
My parents are pleased, as well,
actually.

53:48.644 --> 53:49.660
New start.

53:54.704 --> 53:55.708
Bye.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.648
Do you want to sit here?

54:37.720 --> 54:39.672
Hi...

55:01.712 --> 55:04.680
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm reading.

55:21.720 --> 55:25.688
We need a doctor!

55:32.656 --> 55:34.683
My name's Dr Gemma Foster.
Are you his wife? Yes.

55:34.684 --> 55:38.659
Call 999, tell them it's a cardiac
arrest... Tom, I need my bag!

55:38.660 --> 55:39.695
Thank you.

55:39.696 --> 55:41.687
..Sir?

55:41.688 --> 55:45.644
I need an ambulance. It's my
husband. He's had a cardiac arrest.

55:50.672 --> 55:53.628
OK, everyone, stand back!
Give us some room!
