WEBVTT

00:01.894 --> 00:03.711
(wind whistling)

00:12.162 --> 00:13.595
(Grace sighs)

00:14.406 --> 00:15.497
Okay.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.350
-Come on. Please.
Please, please.
-(dialing phone)

00:18.460 --> 00:20.352
-Gracie, give it up, okay?
-(line beeping)

00:20.504 --> 00:21.854
At this point
all that thing's good for

00:22.081 --> 00:23.080
is keeping your ear warm.

00:23.173 --> 00:25.006
(keypad beeping)

00:25.100 --> 00:26.841
CB radio, on the other hand,

00:26.861 --> 00:28.252
that would come in handy,
wouldn't it?

00:28.270 --> 00:30.270
I'm sorry, what was that?

00:30.364 --> 00:32.256
Oh, I was just saying
if we'd taken my truck

00:32.274 --> 00:34.182
like I suggested
back at the house...

00:34.201 --> 00:37.944
Billy, if you're on your way
to an I-told-you-so?

00:38.097 --> 00:40.097
I will rip your
weasel tongue out,

00:40.190 --> 00:42.624
stick it to that windshield
just to watch it freeze.

00:43.936 --> 00:45.527
You conjure quite an image.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.628
(Grace sighs)

00:47.773 --> 00:49.214
How's them contractions?

00:49.366 --> 00:50.941
They still coming
on the regular?

00:51.034 --> 00:52.459
GRACE: Oh, God, please, no.

00:52.611 --> 00:53.701
(winces)

00:53.721 --> 00:55.763
(screaming in pain)

00:57.040 --> 00:58.949
Why would you say that?

00:59.042 --> 01:00.225
-Oops.
-(Grace groaning)

01:00.377 --> 01:02.302
-GRACE: Ooh. (gasping)
-Sorry.

01:02.454 --> 01:05.064
Uh... Okay, just think of
something else, okay?

01:05.215 --> 01:07.140
Uh... Why don't you...

01:07.293 --> 01:08.716
You-you wanna squeeze my hand?

01:08.736 --> 01:09.976
Just squeeze my hand.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.795
You can keep
your weasel hands

01:11.888 --> 01:13.614
as far away from me
as possible.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.316
How about that?

01:16.468 --> 01:20.487
Seems we have
a running weasel theme here.

01:20.639 --> 01:23.657
All right. Why don't I
go do some foraging, huh?

01:23.809 --> 01:25.400
Maybe I can find a car

01:25.419 --> 01:28.236
that still drives or at least
has a working radio.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.996
Yeah, I think
that would be wise.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.149
You know, like my truck.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.759
-You-- you're a dead man.
-Be right back.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.260
Here I go.

01:35.912 --> 01:38.222
(wind whistling)

01:43.920 --> 01:47.347
(theme music plays)

01:47.441 --> 01:49.683
<i> ♪ When I'm alone</i>
<i> and I'm dreaming... ♪</i>

01:49.835 --> 01:51.944
TK: Come on, Mom, could
we please try one now?

01:52.171 --> 01:54.671
GWYNETH: Just give it
one more second to cool.

01:54.764 --> 01:55.839
TK: Ugh!

01:55.932 --> 01:58.099
Don't ugh me.
(laughs)

01:58.119 --> 01:59.526
Remember that Purim
when you tried to eat

01:59.620 --> 02:00.768
the hamantaschen
right out of the oven?

02:00.863 --> 02:01.936
I was like nine.

02:02.105 --> 02:03.864
And you couldn't
taste anything for a week.

02:04.016 --> 02:04.865
TK: That's not true.

02:05.017 --> 02:05.849
It was two weeks

02:05.868 --> 02:06.867
and everything tasted like hair.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.627
(both chuckle)

02:10.372 --> 02:13.281
You ever think about
going back, to temple?

02:13.375 --> 02:14.207
TK: I don't know.

02:14.526 --> 02:16.543
It's just been so long,
it would...

02:16.695 --> 02:18.119
it would be weird now.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.547
I think it would be
good for you...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.958
you know, to get back in touch
with that part of yourself.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.126
Now more than ever.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.703
I'll think about it, okay?

02:26.722 --> 02:27.795
Hmm.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.648
-Now, could we please try one?
-MOM: Sure.

02:29.799 --> 02:30.732
Yes!

02:32.987 --> 02:35.045
-Oh, wow.
-They're pretty good, huh?

02:35.063 --> 02:36.488
(chewing) Pretty good?

02:36.640 --> 02:38.139
That is the best cookie
I've ever had in my life.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.308
You know what the best part
about that cookie is?

02:40.402 --> 02:42.219
-TK: Hmm?
-Calorie-free.

02:42.237 --> 02:43.053
How?

02:43.164 --> 02:46.206
Because, silly,
they don't exist.

02:50.562 --> 02:52.487
Um... Mom?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.488
Yes.

02:53.582 --> 02:54.756
Am I dead?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.492
You're not dead.

02:57.586 --> 02:58.568
Are you?

02:58.662 --> 03:00.179
I'm not even here.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.072
How am I talking to you then?

03:02.165 --> 03:03.182
Because you need me

03:03.333 --> 03:05.075
to be the person
to tell you this.

03:05.168 --> 03:07.411
-Tell me what?
-Stop it.

03:07.504 --> 03:08.604
Stop what?

03:09.748 --> 03:11.581
Dying.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.840
(monitor beeping echoes)

03:12.935 --> 03:13.934
JANINE:<i> On two.</i>

03:14.086 --> 03:15.009
One, two.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.528
(beeping continues)

03:16.721 --> 03:18.447
NURSE: God, look at him.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.032
So young.

03:20.183 --> 03:22.201
JANINE:
Kid's a hero too, apparently.

03:22.352 --> 03:24.110
Heard he got hurt
saving a little boy.

03:24.263 --> 03:25.537
NURSE: He would have
been better off

03:25.689 --> 03:26.371
if they'd never brought him back

03:26.615 --> 03:28.040
from that cardiac
out in the snow.

03:28.191 --> 03:30.934
JANINE: Yep, now he gets to
torture the friends and family

03:31.027 --> 03:31.785
for another three days.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.936
NURSE: Three days?

03:32.955 --> 03:35.029
I've seen one
go for three weeks.

03:35.123 --> 03:36.940
No kidding. In this state?

03:37.033 --> 03:39.534
Yup. First year
out of nursing school.

03:39.553 --> 03:43.722
Well, either way, at this point,
it's a matter of when, not...

03:45.542 --> 03:46.466
I...

03:46.560 --> 03:47.634
We didn't mean--

03:47.803 --> 03:49.711
Dr. Patel will be
by soon with an update.

03:49.805 --> 03:50.787
Excuse us.

03:50.806 --> 03:52.731
(machine hissing)

03:54.050 --> 03:57.361
(somber music)

04:00.816 --> 04:03.325
(wind gusting)

04:04.060 --> 04:06.203
(Buttercup panting)

04:08.064 --> 04:10.732
(sighs deeply)

04:10.751 --> 04:12.900
OWEN: Welcome home, big boy.

04:12.995 --> 04:14.461
(clicks switch)

04:15.998 --> 04:17.464
Oh, great.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.425
We came home to rough it.

04:24.823 --> 04:25.989
(exhales, shivers)

04:26.008 --> 04:28.433
(melancholy guitar playing)

04:33.832 --> 04:35.732
(rattling faucet)

04:44.009 --> 04:45.450
(sighs deeply)

04:58.966 --> 05:01.216
(Buttercup whines)

05:01.969 --> 05:04.261
(clattering)

05:09.868 --> 05:11.727
(fire truck beeping)

05:17.759 --> 05:19.985
JUDD: Marwani, you're back.

05:20.212 --> 05:21.486
I've been trying to reach you.

05:21.638 --> 05:24.156
Hey, did you ever manage
to get in touch with the Cap?

05:24.307 --> 05:25.640
It's nice to see you, too.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.733
Yeah, I saw him.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.160
In fact, he just
dropped me off.

05:28.311 --> 05:29.069
So he's back in town?

05:29.221 --> 05:30.887
Oh, it's a whole story.

05:30.906 --> 05:31.854
What, uh... Where is he now?

05:31.856 --> 05:33.056
I assume home. Why?

05:33.075 --> 05:35.167
I still got no service. Uh...

05:35.318 --> 05:37.419
Did you get him to sign
the Billy letter?

05:38.413 --> 05:39.320
What are you doing here?

05:39.506 --> 05:40.505
I thought you were
assigned to the 129.

05:40.990 --> 05:44.918
Captain Tatum loaned me
to the 122 to help dig Paul out.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.403
Dig Paul out?
Dig him out of what?

05:46.421 --> 05:48.755
Gym collapse over at
the Providence Pasture Church.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.182
What was he doing there?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.742
We were all there.
After the first collapse.

05:52.761 --> 05:53.910
You are aware

05:54.096 --> 05:56.262
that you start your stories
in the middle, yeah?

05:56.431 --> 05:59.432
-So did you get him out?
-Yeah, we got him out.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.750
So where is he?

06:00.844 --> 06:01.751
In the hospital.

06:01.770 --> 06:02.936
Is he okay?

06:03.088 --> 06:05.088
Yeah, I mean, he's okay.

06:05.181 --> 06:06.013
MARJAN: All right.

06:06.108 --> 06:09.016
So... who's not?

06:09.036 --> 06:13.187
(monitor beeping)

06:13.207 --> 06:15.374
Am I the world's
biggest schmuck?

06:16.785 --> 06:17.751
What?

06:18.862 --> 06:19.878
I'm holding vigil for a man

06:20.029 --> 06:22.789
who doesn't even
want me in his life.

06:22.941 --> 06:26.426
Doesn't that just
scream "schmuck"?

06:27.629 --> 06:28.962
Hell to the no.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.057
First of all, TK loves you.

06:32.208 --> 06:35.894
And second, where did you
pick up "schmuck"?

06:36.045 --> 06:37.437
From TK.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.648
Must have rubbed off.

06:42.294 --> 06:43.693
Why do you say that?

06:44.796 --> 06:46.554
That he loves me?

06:46.573 --> 06:48.281
Because it's true.

06:51.895 --> 06:54.454
You've been by his side
all this time.

06:55.064 --> 06:56.456
Does he ever...

06:57.809 --> 06:59.901
talk about me?

06:59.995 --> 07:02.103
Honestly, not much.

07:02.105 --> 07:02.996
I didn't think so.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.925
But he does bite off my head

07:07.076 --> 07:08.985
any time I bring up your name.

07:09.004 --> 07:10.912
That makes me feel
so much better.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.639
It should, you big dummy.

07:14.009 --> 07:15.767
He doesn't wanna hear it

07:15.919 --> 07:17.343
because it's
too painful for him,

07:17.496 --> 07:21.231
which means he still
has it bad for you.

07:21.925 --> 07:23.683
It's obvious.

07:23.835 --> 07:25.527
Dude loves you.

07:29.024 --> 07:30.490
If he loves me so much...

07:33.862 --> 07:35.454
then why did he break my heart?

07:46.133 --> 07:47.524
How do you like the new look?

07:47.542 --> 07:49.468
(whines)

07:49.619 --> 07:53.196
Yeah, you're right.
It's pretty much
just the same old look.

07:53.289 --> 07:55.323
But no reaction, huh? Really?

07:55.325 --> 07:57.142
How about this?
This give you a reaction?

07:57.293 --> 07:58.702
-(Buttercup whines)
-Yeah.

07:58.795 --> 08:00.270
(knock on door)

08:06.636 --> 08:07.986
Captain Vega.

08:09.047 --> 08:10.805
Owen...

08:10.899 --> 08:11.973
What's happened?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.159
We need to talk.

08:19.741 --> 08:21.374
(quiet chatter)

08:22.352 --> 08:24.628
(indistinct announcement
over PA)

08:35.741 --> 08:39.017
They're telling me that his body
is trying to shut down.

08:40.262 --> 08:43.146
And they say it's
because his heart stopped.

08:46.175 --> 08:47.600
But I don't think that's right,

08:47.694 --> 08:49.486
I think it's because mine did.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.032
You were right.

08:54.183 --> 08:55.951
I gave up. I quit.

08:57.262 --> 09:00.446
And it didn't-- wasn't
about ego... or pride.

09:00.599 --> 09:01.665
I wish it was.

09:02.934 --> 09:04.543
It was about fear.

09:05.862 --> 09:08.880
Our world imploded
so spectacularly

09:09.107 --> 09:13.426
and everybody was looking to me
to put it back together and...

09:16.114 --> 09:18.390
I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to.

09:18.617 --> 09:19.599
This time.

09:20.969 --> 09:23.228
And so I ran away.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.808
Everything that's happening...
it's my fault.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.901
No, Owen.

09:30.053 --> 09:31.903
OWEN: No, but it's-it's true.

09:32.055 --> 09:34.406
So you can tell the universe.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.723
Message received.

09:35.817 --> 09:37.075
I mean, it may be too late

09:37.226 --> 09:38.910
and I may not be able
to fix things,

09:39.062 --> 09:41.062
but I'm sure as hell gonna try.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.581
I'm not waitin' around.

09:42.732 --> 09:43.807
What does that mean?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.417
It means I'm gonna go
find Billy Tyson,

09:45.568 --> 09:47.919
gonna put that signed
letter of apology in his hand,

09:48.071 --> 09:49.979
and I'm gonna
get myself reinstated.

09:49.998 --> 09:51.756
You're gonna go do that now?

09:51.908 --> 09:54.283
It's something he<i> can</i> do.

09:55.596 --> 09:59.681
Look, I don't know if I can
fix the world in time for my...

10:00.934 --> 10:02.559
for my boy to wake up, but...

10:03.829 --> 10:04.936
When he does, I want him to see

10:05.180 --> 10:08.089
that he's not the only Strand
who's still fighting.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.682
Would you like
some company, Captain?

10:09.835 --> 10:11.334
I would love that.

10:11.427 --> 10:13.778
You can reach me on my radio
if you need me.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.171
PAUL: Hey, Cap?

10:15.264 --> 10:17.365
It's good to have you back.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.784
(wind whistling)

10:36.803 --> 10:39.028
(Grace sighs)

10:39.122 --> 10:42.140
God, I've never been
this cold in my life.

10:44.886 --> 10:46.870
And I know...

10:46.963 --> 10:50.482
I got myself here
because I was headstrong

10:50.633 --> 10:52.692
and I was reckless.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.405
I was filled with wrath...

10:58.566 --> 11:00.659
even though I'm...
I'm kinda hoping

11:00.810 --> 11:02.051
you'll overlook that last part

11:02.145 --> 11:05.205
because this is Billy Tyson
we're talking about.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.207
(sighs)

11:08.059 --> 11:09.575
I'm scared now, God.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.461
(shuddering breaths)

11:13.156 --> 11:16.916
I'm asking that you please
deliver me out of this.

11:17.068 --> 11:19.326
Not for me,
but because this child

11:19.346 --> 11:21.554
deserves a chance
to meet her father.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.759
-Please, God.
-(knock on window)

11:26.853 --> 11:28.502
Wanna open the door, please.

11:28.596 --> 11:29.562
(sighs)

11:31.766 --> 11:33.416
Did you find something?

11:33.418 --> 11:35.509
Not gonna be the answer
to your prayers or anything

11:35.529 --> 11:38.922
-but better than
sticking around in this icebox.
-Okay.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.440
How far do you think
you can you walk?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.158
As far as it takes.

11:46.765 --> 11:49.332
(tense music)

11:52.862 --> 11:53.878
Let me help you.

11:54.030 --> 11:55.104
GRACE: I got it. I got it.

11:55.123 --> 11:56.548
(Grace exhales deeply)

11:56.699 --> 11:58.383
(wind whistling)

12:01.037 --> 12:03.388
(monitor beeping)

12:04.891 --> 12:06.891
(knock on door)

12:07.043 --> 12:09.185
-CARLOS: Mom?
-ANDREA: Carlitos.

12:11.589 --> 12:12.972
<i> Aye, mi amor.</i>

12:13.066 --> 12:15.216
What are you doing here?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.884
I told you not to go
out in the storm.

12:16.978 --> 12:17.977
ANDREA:<i> Callate.</i>

12:18.129 --> 12:19.904
You think I'd let
a few snowflakes

12:20.056 --> 12:21.647
keep me from my boy
when he's hurting?

12:21.800 --> 12:23.483
Does Dad know you're here?

12:23.635 --> 12:25.201
What is he gonna say?

12:26.304 --> 12:28.705
Well, I... I appreciate it.

12:43.746 --> 12:44.763
What are the doctors saying?

12:44.914 --> 12:46.431
That he, uh...

12:48.660 --> 12:50.935
he's heading
in the wrong direction.

12:51.087 --> 12:53.162
Well, the doctors
don't know everything.

12:53.181 --> 12:55.756
This boy is a fighter.

12:55.850 --> 12:58.184
And he has
something to fight for.

12:58.336 --> 13:00.261
He's got the love of his life

13:00.355 --> 13:02.655
sitting right here
waiting for him.

13:03.858 --> 13:05.492
We broke up.

13:07.436 --> 13:08.495
What?

13:09.681 --> 13:11.164
When?

13:11.774 --> 13:13.032
A few months ago.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.535
Why didn't you say anything?

13:15.687 --> 13:18.354
I wanted to, but...

13:18.373 --> 13:22.191
it was so amazing
how you and Dad supported us.

13:22.210 --> 13:24.177
I just didn't want to
let you down.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.383
Carlos...

13:30.477 --> 13:33.052
there is nothing
you can do to let us down.

13:33.204 --> 13:37.206
Your father and I are so proud
of the man you are.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.193
You have no idea how proud.

13:44.974 --> 13:46.658
Thank you.

13:46.885 --> 13:48.701
And we love TK too.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.573
But when this boy wakes up,

13:53.725 --> 13:56.251
we're gonna have
a little conversation.

13:57.245 --> 13:59.320
A conversation about what?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.898
About why he thought
he can break my baby's heart

14:01.916 --> 14:03.399
and get away with it.

14:03.492 --> 14:04.843
Hmm?

14:04.994 --> 14:08.137
-Mama's not happy.
-(laughing)

14:09.165 --> 14:11.182
(wind whistling)

14:11.334 --> 14:12.725
BILLY: Just a little further.

14:13.854 --> 14:14.927
Here we are.

14:15.096 --> 14:17.230
-GRACE: What is this?
-BILLY: A tour bus.

14:18.341 --> 14:19.673
GRACE:
We gettin' out in this, Billy?

14:19.842 --> 14:22.318
BILLY:
Nah, it ain't going nowhere,
but it's shelter.

14:23.012 --> 14:24.487
Come on.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.159
(Grace panting)

14:33.206 --> 14:34.688
BILLY: What do you think?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.023
GRACE: It's not exactly sterile.

14:36.117 --> 14:38.293
Yeah, neither was the manger.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.046
Couch.
A restroom in the back,

14:42.198 --> 14:43.940
though I can't speak
to the plumbing.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.608
Here, why don't you...

14:45.627 --> 14:46.959
You lay down.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.262
(groans sharply, exhales)

14:50.873 --> 14:52.706
No, not that one.
I brought my own.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.267
I don't know where
that one's been.

14:55.044 --> 14:57.120
All right, good call.

14:57.138 --> 14:58.471
-(Billy sighs)
-GRACE: I got it, I got it.

14:58.623 --> 15:01.190
BILLY: I'll see if I can
get the heat going for us.

15:01.793 --> 15:02.959
GRACE: Whoo!

15:03.052 --> 15:04.903
Billy, you didn't really
expect to find the keys

15:05.054 --> 15:06.070
under the seat, did you?

15:06.297 --> 15:08.389
Expecting? No.
I was hoping, though.

15:08.483 --> 15:11.134
Luckily, I possess
a set of skills

15:11.227 --> 15:13.912
one might call extra-legal.

15:14.063 --> 15:15.655
Billy Tyson has a shady side?

15:15.807 --> 15:17.165
Knock me over with a feather.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.825
(engine starts, revving)

15:19.961 --> 15:22.736
(beeping)

15:22.756 --> 15:23.980
Now we're cookin' with gas.

15:23.998 --> 15:25.506
(exhales)

15:26.651 --> 15:27.667
(engine turns off)

15:27.819 --> 15:30.002
-What happened?
-No gas.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.597
Well, we gotta go
somewhere else then, Billy.

15:32.824 --> 15:34.248
(groans sharply)

15:34.267 --> 15:35.934
Those contractions are comin'
thick and fast now, okay?

15:36.085 --> 15:38.661
You can't be out
in the elements trying
to deliver no baby.

15:38.754 --> 15:39.771
What difference does it make?

15:39.998 --> 15:42.089
Either we freeze in here
or we freeze out here.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.233
We are not gonna freeze, okay?

15:45.019 --> 15:47.170
We just need some fuel.

15:47.263 --> 15:49.005
So you just gonna
walk over to the filling station

15:49.023 --> 15:50.615
and get some?

15:50.766 --> 15:51.857
No.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.452
I'm gonna go
siphon us some with this.

15:56.698 --> 15:58.289
(sighs)

15:58.291 --> 15:59.332
(groans)

16:04.798 --> 16:06.947
This is Captain Tommy Vega

16:06.967 --> 16:08.524
going for Deputy Chief Tyson.

16:08.543 --> 16:11.877
Don't use my name.
It gets him awfully skittish.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.721
Yeah, I'm aware.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.049
TOMMY:
Deputy Chief Tyson, do you copy?

16:17.202 --> 16:18.726
This is Tommy Vega.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.270
Radio silence.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.729
Owen, I, uh,
I-I need to tell you--

16:29.823 --> 16:32.215
No. No.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.158
-You don't have to do that.
-Yes, I-I really do.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.718
No, no, you don't.
You know why?

16:35.737 --> 16:37.245
Because I don't wanna hear it.

16:38.147 --> 16:39.831
What are you gonna say?

16:39.982 --> 16:42.892
There's something
you could have done
differently or better.

16:42.985 --> 16:44.669
Yes. Yes, that's right.

16:44.896 --> 16:46.462
Well, you know what?
You're right.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.757
Because there always is.

16:52.904 --> 16:55.996
(inhales and exhales deeply)

16:56.090 --> 16:58.141
You don't have to ask
for my forgiveness.

17:01.095 --> 17:02.729
You already have it.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.084
Thank you.
For saying that.

17:08.177 --> 17:10.153
Yeah. I mean...

17:12.257 --> 17:13.756
No matter what happens,

17:13.849 --> 17:15.182
I can't think of anyone

17:15.351 --> 17:19.162
I would have rather have had
my son serve under than you.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.628
-(radio chirps)
-This is Captain Vega...

17:29.107 --> 17:30.606
for Deputy Chief Tyson.

17:30.625 --> 17:31.698
Do you read?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.761
(dramatic music)

17:44.956 --> 17:46.731
(spits, coughs)

17:48.735 --> 17:50.318
Good God.

17:51.053 --> 17:53.154
(spits, coughs)

17:54.723 --> 17:55.698
(grunts)

18:02.307 --> 18:04.665
It almost looks like he's
trying to say something, no?

18:06.477 --> 18:09.087
The nurse said
they're just muscle spasms.

18:09.314 --> 18:11.071
They don't mean anything.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.299
Well, I wouldn't
be so sure of that.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.504
I think you need
to talk to him, son.

18:18.656 --> 18:19.722
No.

18:20.842 --> 18:22.350
Why not?

18:23.752 --> 18:26.086
I wouldn't know what to say.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.688
You tell him
what's on your heart.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.924
If I told him
what's on my heart,

18:30.944 --> 18:32.777
it wouldn't be very nice.

18:32.928 --> 18:34.761
-Because you're angry?
-Yes.

18:34.856 --> 18:37.097
-Then tell him.
-I can't right now, Mom.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.009
Now is the time, Carlitos.

18:40.027 --> 18:42.662
He needs to hear it
and you need to say it.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.274
Heaven forbid
that this is your last chance

18:47.368 --> 18:49.627
to say what you need
to say to this man.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.505
<i> Hazlo, mijo.</i>

18:59.030 --> 19:00.721
I'll be outside.

19:13.728 --> 19:16.529
(somber music)

19:30.077 --> 19:31.669
(groaning) Ohh, you're back.

19:31.896 --> 19:33.296
Hey, I'm back.

19:34.156 --> 19:35.173
How we doing?

19:35.324 --> 19:36.899
GRACE: I'd be better
if you told me you found

19:36.918 --> 19:37.900
an epidural out there, Billy.

19:37.919 --> 19:39.402
(scoffs)

19:39.420 --> 19:40.419
No.

19:40.588 --> 19:43.163
I did find about a gallon
of diesel, though,

19:43.299 --> 19:45.366
which does seem to take
the edge off, by the way.

19:45.426 --> 19:46.517
Oh!

19:46.928 --> 19:48.911
(blows)

19:49.004 --> 19:50.579
All right, come on, girl.

19:50.598 --> 19:53.274
(engine starts, revving)

19:54.677 --> 19:56.527
Yeah. Here we go.

19:56.679 --> 19:59.012
-You hear that?
-I hear it, Billy, I hear it.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.589
Heat's on full blast.

20:00.591 --> 20:03.201
Should only take
a minute to warm up.

20:03.428 --> 20:06.946
Apologies if I smell
like a barrel of crude.

20:07.098 --> 20:09.040
-You okay?
-BILLY: Yeah, fine.

20:09.267 --> 20:13.118
Just a sip or two of diesel
over my personal limit.

20:13.271 --> 20:15.046
Are you sure, Billy?
Your eyes look a little glassy.

20:15.273 --> 20:17.215
Yeah, I'm fine, okay?
Just stop.

20:17.442 --> 20:19.625
-(groans)
-I'm supposed to be
looking after you.

20:19.777 --> 20:20.776
(gasps)

20:20.795 --> 20:22.178
(body thuds)

20:23.464 --> 20:25.205
TOMMY (over radio):
<i> Hey, Juddy, you there?</i>

20:25.225 --> 20:27.116
<i> -It's Tommy.</i>
-Yeah, I'm here.

20:27.134 --> 20:29.134
You able to track down
Captain Strand?

20:29.229 --> 20:31.062
He's, uh,
here with me actually.

20:31.289 --> 20:32.288
JUDD (over radio):
<i> Hey, Cap.</i>

20:32.381 --> 20:34.807
I want you to know
how sorry I am about TK.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.792
<i> And I'm praying for him.</i>

20:36.885 --> 20:37.810
I appreciate that.

20:37.962 --> 20:39.478
Um, have you happened

20:39.572 --> 20:40.887
to have heard from your wife?

20:40.982 --> 20:43.649
JUDD:<i> No, not since</i>
<i> the cell phones went down,</i>

20:43.801 --> 20:44.766
<i> but she's at home.</i>

20:44.819 --> 20:45.910
Why?

20:46.061 --> 20:47.578
Uh, actually, she's not at home.

20:47.730 --> 20:49.472
What do you mean?
How do you know that?

20:49.490 --> 20:51.082
Because we're standing
in your living room.

20:51.309 --> 20:53.066
What the hell y'all doing?

20:53.160 --> 20:54.827
Judd, we've been trying
to track down Billy.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.070
<i> We had his GPS ping</i>
<i> to this location</i>

20:57.090 --> 21:00.149
and his truck is out front,
but he's gone.

21:00.167 --> 21:01.742
We were wondering if you
might know where they are.

21:01.836 --> 21:02.835
JUDD:<i> There is no they.</i>

21:02.929 --> 21:04.336
Grace ain't going
nowhere with Billy.

21:04.489 --> 21:07.247
<i> So look around, see if</i>
<i> you can find a pink duffel.</i>

21:07.267 --> 21:09.842
Okay? That's her go-bag
for the hospital.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.585
-Yeah, there's no baby bag.
-(sighs)

21:11.679 --> 21:14.663
Well, then she must
have gone into labor
of all the damn days.

21:14.757 --> 21:15.606
All right, Juddy.

21:15.758 --> 21:17.182
We've radioed every hospital

21:17.335 --> 21:19.092
within 20 miles
and no one's got her.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.113
Yeah, which means that
she's stuck out there in this.

21:22.264 --> 21:24.006
Where were you planning
on having the baby?

21:24.025 --> 21:25.766
Our birth plan
was for West Park.

21:25.860 --> 21:26.859
Okay, we're gonna
head over there.

21:27.011 --> 21:28.119
I'll see if I can get
Captain Andrews

21:28.270 --> 21:29.603
to lend me a truck
so we can start looking too.

21:29.697 --> 21:31.772
You come in from the north,
we'll come in from the south

21:31.866 --> 21:34.292
<i> -and meet in the middle.</i>
-Please, God.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.461
Just let her be okay.

21:45.029 --> 21:46.119
(exhales)

21:46.139 --> 21:48.764
(inhales and exhales deeply)

22:05.900 --> 22:07.408
Hey, TK.

22:09.495 --> 22:10.619
It's me.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.710
I've been here for a while now.

22:21.082 --> 22:24.157
I don't even know
if you want that, but...

22:24.251 --> 22:27.428
I guess you're
not in any position
to walk out this time.

22:29.164 --> 22:31.140
And even if you can't hear it...

22:33.594 --> 22:35.144
Mom's right.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.230
I just need to say it.

22:42.010 --> 22:43.694
I'm so mad at you right now.

22:47.274 --> 22:49.742
And the worst part
about this is...

22:51.262 --> 22:53.162
if this is...

22:54.707 --> 22:56.165
goodbye.

23:01.697 --> 23:03.297
I can't even hold your hand.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.178
Or run my fingers
through your hair, or...

23:11.057 --> 23:12.640
kiss your head.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.691
Not without it feeling like
it's some kind of violation.

23:28.891 --> 23:31.634
Believe people when
they tell you who they are.

23:31.727 --> 23:33.452
Just believe them, right?

23:34.396 --> 23:35.246
He looks so mad, Mom.

23:35.489 --> 23:36.805
CARLOS:
Yeah, well, that's exactly...

23:36.899 --> 23:38.307
He doesn't look
particularly happy.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.025
...when you walked out
our first date.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.810
What in the world
did you do to this boy?

23:41.829 --> 23:44.755
Why do you immediately
assume that it was my fault?

23:44.982 --> 23:47.166
'Cause I'll have you know that
there was blame on both sides.

23:47.318 --> 23:48.817
...I didn't, and that's okay.

23:48.836 --> 23:50.261
MOM: Tyler Kennedy.

23:50.412 --> 23:53.322
You don't really want to
go with that line, do you?

23:53.340 --> 23:55.658
That's your mechanism
of defense, right?

23:55.751 --> 23:57.843
Whatever it was,
just own it.

23:57.995 --> 24:00.462
Why do I even have to tell you?
I mean, you already know.

24:00.514 --> 24:02.940
You're just a figment
of my imagination.

24:03.167 --> 24:05.693
Figment or not,
I am still your mother.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.528
Ugh.

24:09.674 --> 24:10.573
(sighs)

24:11.842 --> 24:14.026
Okay, fine.

24:14.178 --> 24:16.287
Remember when
Carlos' townhouse burned down?

24:16.438 --> 24:17.455
Who can forget?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.291
So many innocent hoodies
lost their lives that night.

24:20.518 --> 24:21.441
(sighs)

24:21.627 --> 24:24.186
After that, you know,
we were staying with Dad

24:24.279 --> 24:26.255
while looking for a place and...

24:27.374 --> 24:30.116
Carlos eventually
found this loft downtown

24:30.136 --> 24:32.619
with polished concrete floors

24:32.713 --> 24:34.363
and great light and,

24:34.381 --> 24:36.640
you know, walking distance
to some amazing nightlife.

24:36.792 --> 24:37.866
That sounds fantastic.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.143
Ugh, you have no idea.

24:39.294 --> 24:41.562
I was so in love with it, but...

24:42.798 --> 24:44.039
they didn't wanna lease it.

24:44.132 --> 24:46.484
They were looking for buyers,
not renters.

24:46.635 --> 24:48.986
And you couldn't come up
with the down payment.

24:49.137 --> 24:52.214
Well, you know my credit...

24:53.159 --> 24:55.642
I-I haven't always made
the best choices.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.069
You don't say.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.813
So then we had to deal with
the crushing disappointment.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.815
Whose crushing disappointment?

25:01.867 --> 25:04.076
Mostly mine.

25:04.228 --> 25:06.504
You know, Carlos said
he didn't care where he lives

25:06.731 --> 25:08.214
so long as it was with me.

25:09.157 --> 25:10.991
So we agreed to keep looking...

25:11.085 --> 25:14.236
until eventually he says
he thinks he found something,

25:14.255 --> 25:19.016
and he takes me back to
the same exact place and says,

25:19.167 --> 25:22.094
"Surprise, it's ours!"

25:22.188 --> 25:25.097
So without telling me,
he went back and made an offer.

25:25.249 --> 25:26.932
That is so romantic.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.935
Romantic?
It's-it's a total power move.

25:30.087 --> 25:32.921
Or an unbelievably
sweet gesture.

25:33.015 --> 25:34.347
Well, it could be both.

25:34.367 --> 25:38.244
It was...
a really sweet power move.

25:38.962 --> 25:40.020
I mean...

25:40.114 --> 25:41.855
he didn't want me to feel like

25:41.949 --> 25:43.189
I was just living
in his place again,

25:43.284 --> 25:45.709
so he put me on the deed and...

25:45.861 --> 25:47.269
he knew I didn't
have the money,

25:47.362 --> 25:49.529
but he still made me
a half owner.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.774
So you panicked.

25:51.867 --> 25:53.425
And then I panicked.

25:55.871 --> 25:57.638
Because things were too good.

25:58.707 --> 26:00.632
Everything was perfect.

26:00.785 --> 26:02.309
And then you did the thing.

26:03.637 --> 26:04.620
I did the thing.

26:04.638 --> 26:05.879
You blew it up.

26:05.973 --> 26:07.648
I blew it up.

26:08.642 --> 26:09.692
(both sigh)

26:11.145 --> 26:13.404
TK: I hurt him so bad, Mom.

26:17.134 --> 26:20.160
What if he doesn't
want to take me back?

26:21.472 --> 26:23.664
MOM: There's only
one way to find out.

26:24.975 --> 26:27.476
You need to wake up!

26:27.494 --> 26:29.253

The push-in ceremony
has its origins

38:35.814 --> 38:38.056
dating back to the 1800s

38:38.208 --> 38:42.877
when horses were used
to pull hand pumpers.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.729
But upon returning
to the station,

38:44.881 --> 38:48.716
the horses could not back up
to push in the rigs.

38:48.735 --> 38:50.234
So the firefighters

38:50.387 --> 38:53.413
had to manually push them
into the bays.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.908
In honor of that,

38:57.060 --> 38:59.577
it's become tradition
for firefighters

38:59.671 --> 39:01.563
to push their rigs in

39:01.656 --> 39:04.841
the very first time
they enter their firehouse.

39:05.068 --> 39:07.010
The push-in ceremony reminds us
