WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:03.295
Get down!

00:03.921 --> 00:06.765
- Ah! They're following us.
- And the good news is?

00:06.840 --> 00:10.265
Their life spans are running out,
so we hide, wait for them to die.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.188
I have to stop being a Time Lord.
I'm going to become human.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.436
Chameleon Arch. Rewrites my biology.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.853
"A journal of Impossible Things."

00:18.936 --> 00:21.359
- Such imagination!
- It's become quite a hobby.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.782
He's different from any man
you've ever met, right?

00:23.857 --> 00:24.949
Yes.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.995
He had to go and fall in love
with a human. And it wasn't me.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.198
If they find us Martha, open the watch.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.829
Sometimes I say things
and they turn out to be correct.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.214
They've found us.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.592
- Oh, my God! Where's the watch?
- What are you talking about?

00:42.668 --> 00:45.968
This is not you. This is 1913.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.343
Change back!

00:50.259 --> 00:52.307
We need a Time Lord.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.894
Which one of them
do you want us to kill?

00:55.973 --> 00:58.772
Doesn't this scare you enough
to change back?

00:58.850 --> 01:01.979
Your friend or your lover?

01:43.353 --> 01:46.072
Make your decision, Mr Smith.

01:48.442 --> 01:52.697
Perhaps if that human heart
breaks, the Time Lord will emerge.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.620
- Time Lord.
- Tim!

01:56.950 --> 01:58.293
All right!

01:58.952 --> 02:00.704
One more move and I shoot.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.257
- Oh, the maid is full of fire!
- And you can shut up!

02:04.708 --> 02:07.177
Careful, Son of mine.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.050
She's all for you
so that you can live forever.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.549
Shoot you down.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.930
Try it. We'll die together.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.184
Would you really pull the trigger?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.599
Looks too scared.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.525
Scared and holding a gun
is a good combination.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.603
Do you want to risk it?

02:31.568 --> 02:35.072
Doctor, get everyone out.
There's a door at the side.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.249
It's over there. Go on!

02:37.866 --> 02:40.119
Do it, Mr Smith, I mean you!

02:40.202 --> 02:42.955
Do what she said. Everybody out now!

02:43.288 --> 02:46.292
Don't argue, Mr Jackson.
They're mad, that's all we need to know.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.343
Susan, Miss Cooper, outside, all of you!

02:52.214 --> 02:54.094
Move yourself, boy.
Back to the school, quickly!

02:54.257 --> 02:56.806
- And you, go on, just shift.
- What about you?

02:56.885 --> 03:00.810
Mr Smith, I think you should escort
your lady friend to safety, don't you?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.275
Mr Hicks, warn the village.
Get everyone out.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.202
Latimer, get back to the school.
Tell the headmaster...

03:14.277 --> 03:16.871
Don't touch me! You're as bad as them.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.546
Don't try anything.
I'm warning you, or sonny boy gets it.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.626
- She's almost brave, this one.
- I should have taken her form.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.929
Much more fun, so much spirit.

03:32.003 --> 03:36.008
- What happened to jenny? Has she gone?
- She is consumed. Her body's mine.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.434
You mean she's dead?

03:37.509 --> 03:40.809
Yes, and she went
with precious little dignity.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.480
All that screaming.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.691
Get the gun!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.693
Good work, soldier.

03:47.811 --> 03:52.317
Don't just stand there, move!
God, you're rubbish as a human. Come on!

03:59.781 --> 04:04.127
Run! Ah, this is super.
We've been in hiding for too long.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.749
This is sport!

04:05.829 --> 04:09.584
I can smell the schoolteacher.
He's gone back to his academy.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.010
And what do we know about her?

04:12.836 --> 04:16.966
This body has traces of memory.
Was once her friend.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.892
Martha would go walking to the west.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.346
Husband of mine,
follow the maid's scent.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.434
Go to the west.
Find out what she was keeping secret.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.859
Soldiers!

04:30.729 --> 04:33.528
As for you, Mother of mine,

04:36.234 --> 04:37.326
let's go to school.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.301
- What are you doing?
- Maybe one man can't fight them,

04:53.376 --> 04:55.174
but this school teaches us
to stand together.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.881
Take arms! Take arms!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.137
- Stop doing that!
- You want me to fight, don't you?

05:00.217 --> 05:03.391
- Take arms! Take arms!
- I say, sir, what's the matter?

05:03.470 --> 05:06.724
Enemy at the door, Hutchinson,
enemy at the door.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.192
Take arms!

05:14.815 --> 05:19.366
- They're sounding the alarms.
- I wouldn't be so pleased, Son of mine.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.412
These bodies are silly and hot,
they can damage and die.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.990
That's why we need the Time Lord.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.748
Indeed, they will have guns.
Perhaps a little caution.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.127
Sister of mine,
you're such a small little thing.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.584
Find a way in and spy on them.

05:38.839 --> 05:43.015
- You can't do this, Doctor. Mr Smith!
- Maintain position over the stable yard.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.766
They're just boys,
you can't ask them to fight.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.768
- They don't stand a chance!
- They are cadets, Miss Jones.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.482
They are trained to defend the King
and all his citizens and properties.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.562
What in thunder's name is this?

05:52.644 --> 05:56.194
Before I devise an excellent
and endless series of punishments

05:56.273 --> 05:58.867
for each and every one of you,
could someone explain,

05:58.942 --> 06:01.821
very simply and immediately,
exactly what is going on?

06:01.903 --> 06:04.281
Headmaster, I have to report,
the school is under attack.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.207
Really? Is that so?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.789
Perhaps you and I
should have a word in private.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.000
No, I promise you, sir.
I was in the village with Matron.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.299
It's Baines, sir, Jeremy Baines,
and Mr Clark from Oakham Farm.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.717
They've gone mad, sir. They've got guns.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.592
They've already murdered people
in the village. I saw it happen.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.765
- Matron, is that so?
- I'm afraid it's true, sir.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.435
- Murder? On our own soil?
- I saw it, yes.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.889
Perhaps you did well then, Mr Smith.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.974
And what makes you think
the danger is coming here?

06:31.057 --> 06:35.153
- Well, sir, they said, um...
- Baines threatened Mr Smith, sir.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.107
Said he'd follow him. We don't know why.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.901
Very well.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.863
You boys remain on guard,
Mr Snell, telephone for the police.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.830
Mr Phillips, with me.
We shall investigate.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.374
No! It's not safe out there.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.998
Mr Smith, it seems your
favourite servant is giving me advice.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.170
You will control her, sir.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.666
Got to find that watch.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.094
Hold me, keep me safe.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.143
Keep me dark, keep me closed.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.221
The time is not right, not yet.

07:09.554 --> 07:13.024
Not while the Family is abroad. Danger!

07:16.019 --> 07:18.317
So, Baines,

07:18.396 --> 07:21.366
and one of the cleaning staff.
There's always a woman involved.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.994
Am Ito gather that some practical joke
has got out of hand?

07:25.070 --> 07:28.040
Headmaster, sir. Good evening, sir.
Come to give me a caning, sir?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.116
- Would you like that, sir?
- Keep a civil tongue, boy.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.296
Now, come on, everyone. I suspect
alcohol has played its part in this.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.714
Let's all just calm down.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.713
Who are these friends of yours, Baines,
in fancy dress?

07:38.792 --> 07:43.138
Do you like them, Mr Phillips?
I made them myself.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.843
I'm ever so good at science, sir. Look.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.888
Molecular fringe animation,
fashioned in the shape of straw men.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.440
My own private army, sir.
It's ever so good, sir.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.688
Baines, step apart from this company
and come inside with me.

07:55.767 --> 08:00.739
No, sir. You, sir,
you will send us Mr John Smith.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.067
That's all we want, sir, Mr John Smith,

08:03.149 --> 08:05.993
and whatever he's done with
his Time Lord consciousness.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.868
Then we'd be very happy
to leave you alone.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.996
You speak with someone else's voice,
Baines. Who might that be?

08:12.075 --> 08:14.294
We are the Family of Blood.

08:14.411 --> 08:18.541
- Mr Smith said there had been deaths.
- Yes, sir, and they were good, sir.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.671
Well, I warn you, the school is armed.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.549
All your little tin soldiers.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.015
But tell me, sir,

08:27.090 --> 08:30.014
- will they thank you?
- I don't understand.

08:30.093 --> 08:34.269
What do you know of history, sir?
What do you know of next year?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.726
- You're not making sense, Baines.
- 1914, sir.

08:38.434 --> 08:42.065
Because the Family has travelled
far and wide looking for Mr Smith,

08:42.147 --> 08:44.616
and, oh, the things we have seen.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.153
War is coming.

08:48.236 --> 08:51.991
In foreign fields,
war of the whole wide world

08:52.073 --> 08:55.327
with all your boys
falling down in the mud.

08:55.410 --> 09:00.337
Do you think they will thank the man
who taught them it was glorious?

09:00.415 --> 09:03.510
Don't you forget, boy,
I have been a soldier.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.431
I was in South Africa.
I used my dead mates for sandbags.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.825
I fought with the butt of my riﬂe
when the bullets ran out,

09:09.841 --> 09:12.515
and I would go back there tomorrow
for King and country.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.596
Etcetera, etcetera.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.895
Run along, Headmaster.
Run back to school.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.400
And send us Mr Smith!

09:40.163 --> 09:43.337
Mr Phillips has been murdered.
Mr Smith, can you tell me why?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.884
Honestly, sir, I have no idea.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.088
And the telephone line has been
disconnected. We are on our own.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.471
Well, if we have to make a fight of it,
then make a fight we shall.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.928
Hutchinson, we'll build a barricade
within the courtyards.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.605
Fortify the entrances,
build our defences.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.151
Gentlemen, in the name of the King
we shall stand against them.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.481
- Yes, sir.
- Right, come on. Let's get moving.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.611
Down!

10:11.319 --> 10:14.869
Barricade the kitchens.
Secure the passageway to the stables.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.871
You little coward.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.123
You will do your duty, Latimer,
with the rest of us.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.001
Sandbags to the north and west!

10:22.080 --> 10:25.425
Williams, you take charge. Pemberton,
load the spare magazines with bullets.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.465
Take the magazine cut-off out.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.255
They've got an army.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.136
So do we.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.560
Soldiers.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.599
Soldiers!

10:55.071 --> 10:58.200
Ashington, we need water for
the Vickers gun. See to it.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.456
Faster, all of you, faster.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.834
Lockley, when firing commences,
you're in charge of the gathering.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.589
Peterson, that's not acceptable.
Report to your senior officer.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.648
War comes to England

11:32.108 --> 11:33.906
a year in advance.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.874
Family of mine, wail'.
Hold the soldiers back.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.369
The Time Lord is playing
some sort of trick.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.875
Discover him, Sister of mine.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.877
I know it sounds mad,
but when the Doctor became human,

11:49.959 --> 11:52.303
he took the alien part of himself
and he stored it inside the watch.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.801
It's not really a watch,
it just looks like a watch.

11:54.923 --> 11:59.349
And "alien" means not from abroad,
I take it?

11:59.427 --> 12:03.978
The man you call John Smith,
he was born on another world.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.310
- A different species.
- Yeah.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.862
Then tell me, in this fairy tale,

12:10.897 --> 12:12.649
who are you?

12:12.732 --> 12:13.984
Just a friend.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.288
I'm not... I mean, you haven't
got a rival, as much as I might...

12:18.947 --> 12:21.166
- just his friend.
- And human, I take it?

12:21.241 --> 12:24.120
Human, don't worry. More than that,
I don't just follow him around,

12:24.202 --> 12:25.920
I'm training to be a doctor.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.669
Not an alien doctor,
a proper doctor, a doctor of medicine.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.341
Well, that certainly is nonsense.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.536
Women might train to be doctors,
but hardly the skivvy

12:32.627 --> 12:35.005
and hardly one of your colour.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.173
Oh, do you think?

12:39.384 --> 12:40.886
Bones of the hand.

12:40.969 --> 12:45.270
Carpal bones, proximal row:
scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform.

12:45.348 --> 12:48.022
Distal row:
trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.066
Then the metacarpal bones
extending in three distinct phalanges:

12:51.187 --> 12:53.064
proximal, middle, distal.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.822
- Well, you read that in a book.
- Yes, to pass my exams!

12:57.360 --> 13:00.955
- Can't you see this is true?
- I must go.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.124
If we find that watch, we can stop them.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.621
Those boys are going to fight.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.500
I might not be a doctor,
but I'm still their nurse.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.421
They need me.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.428
Son of mine, Wife of mine.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.924
Father of mine, what have you found?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.971
His Tardis.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.052
The Doctor can't escape.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.483
You're with Armitage and Thwaites,
they know the drill.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.736
- Joan, it's not safe.
- I'm doing my duty, just as much as you.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.948
Fine evening we've had together.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.037
Not quite as planned.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.534
Tell me about Nottingham.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.456
Sorry?

13:47.577 --> 13:51.002
That's where you were brought up,
tell me about it.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.715
Well, it lies on the River Leen

13:56.794 --> 13:59.172
with its southern boundary
following the course of the River Trent,

13:59.255 --> 14:01.758
which ﬂows from Stoke to the Humber.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.932
That sounds like an encyclopaedia.
Where did you live?

14:05.053 --> 14:06.270
Broadmarsh Street,

14:06.346 --> 14:08.895
adjacent to Hockley Terrace
in the district of Radford Parade.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.691
More than facts.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.023
When you were a child,
where did you play?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.945
All those secret little places,

14:15.063 --> 14:18.237
the dens and hideaways
that only a child knows.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.328
Tell me, John, please, tell me.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.789
How can you think I'm not real?

14:26.115 --> 14:29.790
- When I kissed you, was that a lie?
- No, it wasn't, no.

14:29.869 --> 14:34.966
But this Doctor sounds like some...
Some romantic lost prince.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.461
Would you rather that?

14:40.755 --> 14:43.929
- Am I not enough?
- No, that's not true, never.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.560
I've got to go.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.889
Martha was right about one thing.
Those boys, they're children.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.851
John Smith wouldn't want them to fight,
never mind the Doctor.

14:52.934 --> 14:55.904
The John Smith I was getting to know,

14:56.020 --> 14:58.068
he knows it's wrong.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.117
- Doesn't he?
- Mr Smith, if you please!

15:02.819 --> 15:04.821
What choice do I have?

15:17.375 --> 15:18.968
Get those bags piled up, filth.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.171
They're going to mean the difference
between life and death for us.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.515
- Not for you and me.
- What are you babbling about?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.350
We go to battle together.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.730
We fight alongside.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.475
I've seen it. Not here, not now.

15:33.558 --> 15:37.984
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you and I both survive this.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.565
And maybe...

15:40.690 --> 15:44.194
Maybe I was given this watch
so I could help.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.947
I'm sorry.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.580
- Latimer, you filthy coward!
- Oh, yes, sir, every time.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.054
What do I do?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.967
What do I do? What do I do?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.768
Beware!

16:09.886 --> 16:12.264
- Beware of what?
- Her!

16:19.103 --> 16:20.320
Keep away.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.195
- Who are you?
- I saw you at the dance.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.568
You were with that family,
you're one of them.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.404
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.657
- What have you got there?
- Nothing.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.663
Show me, little boy.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.918
I reckon, whatever you are,
you're still in the shape of a girl.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.836
How strong is she, do you think?

16:39.916 --> 16:42.419
Does she really want to see this?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.517
- Time Lord!
- Inside the device.

16:49.592 --> 16:53.597
Everything he is, concealed away
in the hands of a schoolboy.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.641
But now we know
that's all we need to find,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.352
the boy and the watch.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.939
What are we waiting for? Attack!

17:10.905 --> 17:12.373
Stand to!

17:22.666 --> 17:23.964
At post!

17:25.127 --> 17:27.050
Enemy approaching, sir.

17:31.676 --> 17:32.973
Steady.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.681
Find the biting point.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.854
Fear...

17:51.195 --> 17:52.367
Fire!

18:28.357 --> 18:29.859
Cease fire!

18:41.787 --> 18:43.380
Just straw.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.631
Like he said. Straw!

18:47.710 --> 18:50.805
Then no one is dead, sir.
We killed no one.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.848
Stand to!

18:58.387 --> 19:01.106
You, child, come out of the way!
Come into the school!

19:01.223 --> 19:02.645
You don't know who's out there.

19:02.725 --> 19:05.319
It's the Cartwright girl, isn't it?
Come here, come to me.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.648
Mr Rocastle, please, don't go near her.

19:08.731 --> 19:13.032
- You were told to be quiet.
- Just listen to me, she's part of it.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.657
Matron, tell him.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.991
I think... I don't know, I think
you should stay back, Headmaster.

19:18.074 --> 19:22.580
- Mr Smith.
- She was with Baines in the village.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.422
Mr Smith, I've seen
many strange sights this night,

19:25.498 --> 19:28.342
but there is no cause on God's earth
that would allow me

19:28.417 --> 19:31.637
to see this child
in the field of battle, sir.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.257
- Come with me.
- You're funny.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.177
That's right. Now, take my hand.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.099
So funny.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.521
Now, who's going to shoot me?
Any of you, really?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.447
Put down your guns.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.532
But, sir, the Headmaster.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.452
I'll not see this happen, not any more.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.495
You will retreat in an orderly fashion
back through the school.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.037
Hutchinson, lead the way.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.994
- But, sir...
- I said, lead the way.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.793
Well, go on, then. Run!

20:06.372 --> 20:07.999
- Soldiers!
- Come on!

20:08.082 --> 20:10.210
Reanimate!

20:27.476 --> 20:29.604
Let's go, quick as you can!

20:29.687 --> 20:31.314
Don't go to the village, it's not safe!

20:31.397 --> 20:34.901
- And you, ladies.
- Not till we've got the boys out.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.203
One of these boys has got the watch.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.452
- This one?
- No.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.325
- This one?
- No.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.160
- This one?
- No.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.625
Get off me! I said get off!

20:46.704 --> 20:48.923
Ah! This one, is that him?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.338
No.

20:51.459 --> 20:54.008
Right, then we can kill this lot.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
Lord of time.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.467
- That's him.
- Upstairs!

21:01.969 --> 21:04.848
Well, don't just stand there, outside!
Come on, out!

21:13.022 --> 21:14.865
I insist, the pair of you, just go!

21:14.940 --> 21:18.285
If there are any more boys inside,
I'll find them.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.742
I think... Retreat!

21:36.212 --> 21:38.931
Doctor!

21:40.299 --> 21:43.894
Doctor!

21:46.222 --> 21:49.726
Come back, Doctor. Come home!

21:50.392 --> 21:52.611
Come and claim your prize.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.073
Out you come, Doctor,
there's a good boy.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.321
Come to the Family.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.653
Time to end it now!

22:00.736 --> 22:02.238
You recognise it, don't you?

22:02.363 --> 22:04.832
Come out, Doctor!

22:04.907 --> 22:06.375
Come to us.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.373
I've never seen it in my life.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.252
Do you remember its name?

22:13.874 --> 22:16.923
I'm sorry, John, but you wrote about it.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.924
The blue box, you dreamt of a blue box.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.635
I'm not...

22:25.094 --> 22:27.688
I'm John Smith.
That's all I want to be, John Smith!

22:27.763 --> 22:30.141
With his life and his job.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.691
And his love. Why can't I be John Smith?
Isn't he a good man?

22:34.770 --> 22:37.489
- Yes, yes, he is.
- Why can't I stay?

22:39.108 --> 22:41.076
But we need the Doctor.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.953
And what am I, then? Nothing?

22:48.284 --> 22:50.002
I'm just a story.

22:56.292 --> 22:59.296
One more phase
and we won't have to hunt.

22:59.420 --> 23:02.674
The Doctor, Mr Smith,
the boy, the watch,

23:03.340 --> 23:05.217
they will come to us.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.850
Soldiers, guard this thing.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.317
This way, I think I know
somewhere we can hide.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.945
- We've got to keep going.
- Just listen to me for once, John.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.651
Now, follow me.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.538
Power up. Fully armed and ready.

23:27.031 --> 23:31.958
Mother, Father and Sister of mine,
prepare the armaments.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.499
I doubt that England is ready for this.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.254
Fix targets, and counting down.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.599
Here we are. It should be empty.

23:46.342 --> 23:50.063
Oh, it's been a long time
since I've run that far.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.022
But who lives here?

23:52.097 --> 23:54.225
If I'm right, no one.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.534
Hello?

24:09.782 --> 24:12.706
No one home. We should be safe here.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.083
Whose house is it, though?

24:15.204 --> 24:16.626
The Cartwrights'.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.457
That little girl at the school,
she's Lucy Cartwright,

24:18.540 --> 24:22.636
or she's taken Lucy Cartwright's form.
If she came home this afternoon,

24:22.711 --> 24:26.306
and if the parents tried to stop
their little girl, then...

24:26.382 --> 24:28.225
they were vanished.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.850
Stone cold.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.394
How easily I accept these ideas.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.613
I must go to them
before anyone else dies.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.076
You can't.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.454
Martha, there must be something
we can do.

24:49.571 --> 24:50.823
Not without the watch.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.126
You're this Doctor's companion,
can't you help?

24:54.243 --> 24:58.419
What exactly do you do for him?
Why does he need you?

24:59.039 --> 25:00.916
Because he's lonely.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.962
And that's what you want me to become?

25:09.299 --> 25:11.097
What if it's them?

25:13.178 --> 25:16.933
I'm not an expert,
but I don't think scarecrows knock.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.827
I brought you this.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.457
Hold it.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.376
- I won't.
- Please, just hold it.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.001
It told me to find you.
It wants to be held.

25:39.121 --> 25:43.126
You've had this watch all this time?
Why didn't you return it?

25:43.625 --> 25:45.627
Because it was waiting.

25:46.670 --> 25:50.265
Then because I was so scared
of the Doctor.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.808
Why?

25:52.801 --> 25:54.144
Because

25:54.928 --> 25:56.475
I've seen him.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.815
He's like fire and ice and rage.

26:02.978 --> 26:06.198
He's like the night and the storm
and the heart of the sun.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.275
- Stop it.
- He's ancient and forever.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.111
He burns at the centre of time,
and he can see the turn of the universe.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.118
Stop it! I said stop it.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.450
And he's wonderful.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.088
I've still got this, the journal.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.711
Those are just stories.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.927
Now we know that's not true.
Perhaps there's something in here...

26:32.257 --> 26:33.884
What the hell?

26:37.888 --> 26:40.186
This will flush him out,
this will do it!

26:40.265 --> 26:41.858
Super, super fun!

26:44.478 --> 26:46.697
They're destroying the village.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.194
The watch!

26:49.358 --> 26:51.326
John, don't.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.698
Closer.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.952
- Can you hear it?
- Like he's asleep.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.830
- Waiting to waken.
- Why did he speak to me?

26:58.909 --> 27:01.029
Oh, low level telepathic field,
you were born with it.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.915
Just an extra synaptic engram,
causing...

27:06.542 --> 27:09.170
- Is that how he talks?
- That's him!

27:09.628 --> 27:11.722
All you have to do is open it,
and he's back.

27:14.258 --> 27:17.102
You knew this all along and yet
you watched while Miss Redfern and I...

27:17.177 --> 27:19.430
I didn't know how to stop you.

27:19.513 --> 27:23.484
He gave me a list of things to
watch out for, but that wasn't included.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.358
Falling in love?
That didn't even occur to him?

27:26.436 --> 27:29.235
- No.
- Then what sort of man is that?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.238
And now you expect me to die?

27:33.861 --> 27:35.738
It was always going to end, though.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.869
The Doctor said the Family has got
a limited life span,

27:37.948 --> 27:40.417
that's why they need to consume
a Time Lord.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.211
Otherwise, three months and they die.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.547
Like mayﬂies, he said.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.213
So your job was to execute me?

27:50.752 --> 27:52.971
People are dying out there.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.092
They need him, and I need him.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.052
'Cause you've got no idea
what he's like.

27:58.135 --> 28:02.060
I've only just met him,
it wasn't even that long ago, but...

28:03.098 --> 28:04.975
He is everything.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.145
He's just everything to me,
and he doesn't even look at me,

28:08.270 --> 28:09.943
but I don't care.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.033
'Cause I love him to bits.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.071
And I hope to God
he won't remember me saying this.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.957
It's getting closer.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.294
I should have thought of it before.
I can give them this!

28:24.411 --> 28:26.004
Just the watch.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.801
Then they can leave
and I can stay as I am.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.048
You can't do that!

28:29.124 --> 28:30.626
If they want the Doctor,
they can have him.

28:30.751 --> 28:33.630
- He'll never let you do it.
- And if they get what they want, then...

28:33.712 --> 28:36.135
Then it all ends in destruction.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.596
I never read to the end.

28:38.675 --> 28:43.146
Those creatures will live forever,
to breed and conquer.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.351
A war across the stars, for every child.

28:48.185 --> 28:53.237
Martha, Timothy,
would you leave us alone, please?

29:27.391 --> 29:30.736
If I could do this instead of you,
then I would.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.734
I'd hoped...

29:38.360 --> 29:40.783
But my hopes aren't important.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.031
He won't love you.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.669
If he's not you,
then I don't want him to.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.544
I had one husband and he died and I...

29:51.623 --> 29:54.046
I never thought, ever again...

29:56.169 --> 29:57.671
And then you.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.392
- You're so...
- And it was real, I wasn't...

30:04.344 --> 30:06.096
I really thought...

30:08.598 --> 30:10.066
Let me see.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.356
Blasted thing.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.030
Blasted, blasted thing.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.154
I can't even hear it,
it says nothing to me.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.384
They're all safe, aren't they?

30:43.467 --> 30:45.595
The children,

30:46.345 --> 30:48.097
the grandchildren.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.357
Everyone's safe.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.778
Everyone's safe.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.990
- And they all send their love, John.
- Well, then.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.077
It's time.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.621
Thank you.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.504
Did you see?

31:13.997 --> 31:16.546
The Time Lord has such adventures.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.423
But he could never
have a life like that.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.304
And yet I could.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.770
What are you going to do?

31:38.563 --> 31:42.113
We'll blast them into dust,
then fuse the dust into glass

31:42.192 --> 31:44.695
then shatter them all over again!

31:46.154 --> 31:47.371
Just...

31:49.699 --> 31:51.827
just stop the bombardment.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.796
That's all I'm asking.
I'll do anything you want, just stop.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.544
Say please.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.422
Please.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.178
Wait a minute.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.761
Still human.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.439
Look, I can't pretend to understand,
not for a second,

32:12.514 --> 32:15.313
but I want you to know,
I'm innocent in all this.

32:15.434 --> 32:20.110
He made me John Smith.
It's not like I had any control over it.

32:20.188 --> 32:24.694
He didn't just make himself human,
he made himself an idiot.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.120
Same thing, isn't it?

32:27.195 --> 32:29.539
I don't care about this Doctor
and your family,

32:29.614 --> 32:31.537
I just want you to go!

32:32.451 --> 32:34.545
So I've made my choice.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.039
You can have him.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.129
Just take it, please, take him away!

32:40.208 --> 32:41.585
At last!

32:48.592 --> 32:50.936
Don't think that's saved your life!

32:52.888 --> 32:54.606
Family of mine,

32:56.808 --> 32:59.812
now we shall have the lives
of a Time Lord.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.948
It's em PW!

33:09.905 --> 33:12.249
- Where's it gone?
- You tell me!

33:12.908 --> 33:16.378
Oh, I think the explanation might be
you've been fooled

33:16.453 --> 33:18.831
by a simple olfactory misdirection.

33:18.914 --> 33:21.713
A little bit like
ventriloquism of the nose.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.793
It's an elementary trick
in certain parts of the galaxy.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.637
But it has got to be said,

33:25.754 --> 33:28.428
I don't like the look
of that hydrokinometer.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.930
It seems to be indicating
you've got energy feedback

33:31.009 --> 33:32.682
all the way through
the retrostabilisers,

33:32.761 --> 33:35.765
feeding back into
the primary heat converters.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.315
Oh!

33:37.390 --> 33:40.189
'Cause if there's one thing
you shouldn't have done,

33:40.268 --> 33:42.862
you shouldn't have let me press
all those buttons.

33:42.938 --> 33:46.488
But, in fairness,
I will give you one word of advice.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.785
Run.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.789
Get out! Get out!

34:22.643 --> 34:26.739
He never raised his voice,
that was the worst thing.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.409
The fury of the Time Lord.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.235
And then we discovered why,

34:31.319 --> 34:34.493
why this Doctor, who had fought
with gods and demons,

34:34.572 --> 34:37.577
why he 'd run away from us and hidden.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.456
He was being kind.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.963
He wrapped my father
in unbreakable chains

34:46.042 --> 34:48.670
forged in the heart of a dwarf star.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.925
He tricked my mother
into the event horizon

34:53.007 --> 34:56.262
of a collapsing galaxy,
to be imprisoned there

34:57.596 --> 34:58.848
forever.

35:02.434 --> 35:06.780
He still visits my sister,
once a year, every year.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.234
I wonder if one day
he might forgive her,

35:10.317 --> 35:12.160
but there she is, can you see?

35:12.235 --> 35:15.330
He trapped her inside a mirror.

35:15.405 --> 35:18.625
Every mirror.
If ever you look at your reﬂection

35:18.700 --> 35:23.456
and see something move behind you,
just for a second, that's her.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.540
That? always her.

35:27.459 --> 35:31.214
As for me, I was suspended in time,

35:31.296 --> 35:36.143
and the Doctor put me to work
standing over the file-Ids of England

35:36.217 --> 35:38.015
as their protector.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.567
We wanted to live forever.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.229
So the Doctor made sure that we did.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.719
Is it done?

36:12.921 --> 36:14.298
It's done.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.181
The police and the army are at school.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.227
Parents have come to take the boys home.

36:20.303 --> 36:23.307
I should go.
They'll have so many questions.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.976
I'm not sure what to say.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.571
Oh.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.779
You look the same.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.280
Goodness,
you must forgive my rudeness. I...

36:38.947 --> 36:41.120
I find it difficult to look at you.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.960
Doctor, must call you Doctor.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.955
Where is he?

36:48.373 --> 36:51.092
- John Smith.
- He's in here, somewhere.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.590
Like a story.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.886
- Could you change back?
- Yes.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.227
- Will you?
- No.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.810
I see.

37:06.599 --> 37:07.976
Well, then.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.940
He was braver than you, in the end.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.361
That ordinary man.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.118
You chose to change,

37:22.115 --> 37:23.867
he chose to die.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.292
- Come with me.
- Sorry?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.374
Travel with me.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.335
- As what?
- My companion.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.178
But that's not fair.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.516
What must I look like to you, Doctor?

37:41.676 --> 37:44.475
- I must seem so very small.
- No.

37:45.388 --> 37:48.016
We could start again. I'd like that.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.985
You and me, we could try, at least.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.402
'Cause everything
that John Smith is and was,

37:56.441 --> 37:58.660
I'm capable of that, too.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.330
- I can't.
- Please come with me.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.533
- I can't.
- Why not?

38:06.993 --> 38:09.963
John Smith is dead,
and you look like him.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.214
But he's here.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.720
Inside.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.975
If you look in my eyes...

38:23.885 --> 38:27.139
Answer me this,
just one question, that's all.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.272
If the Doctor had never visited us,

38:32.060 --> 38:35.439
never chosen this place on a whim,

38:37.649 --> 38:40.368
would anyone here have died?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.624
You can go.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.802
Right, then, molto bene.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.384
How was she?

39:42.463 --> 39:44.136
Time we moved on.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.640
- If you want, I could go and...
- Time we moved on.

39:48.511 --> 39:52.391
Erm, meant to say,
back there last night,

39:52.515 --> 39:54.233
I would've said anything
to get you to change.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.357
- Oh, yeah, course you would.
- I wasn't really...

39:56.436 --> 39:57.608
- No, no, no.
- Good.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.280
- Fine.
- So there we are, then.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.449
There we are, then, yes.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.368
And I never said.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.618
Thanks for looking after me.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.463
Doctor, Martha.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.132
Tim Timothy Tim!

40:18.207 --> 40:20.505
I just wanted to say goodbye,

40:21.294 --> 40:22.841
and thank you.

40:22.962 --> 40:27.058
Because I've seen the future,
and I now know what must be done.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.184
It's coming, isn't it?
The biggest war ever.

40:31.304 --> 40:34.183
- You don't have to fight.
- I think we do.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.355
But you could get hurt.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.232
So could you,
travelling around with him,

40:38.311 --> 40:40.530
but it's not going to stop you.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.859
Tim, I'd be honoured if you'd take this.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.081
I can't hear anything.

40:51.157 --> 40:55.913
No, it's just a watch now.
But keep it with you for good luck.

40:57.205 --> 40:59.082
Look after yourself.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.592
You'll like this bit.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.332
Incoming!

41:34.283 --> 41:36.661
In june, 1914,

41:36.786 --> 41:40.586
an archduke of Austria
was shot by a Serbian.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.545
And this then lead through nations
having treaties with nations,

41:44.627 --> 41:47.471
like a line of dominoes falling,

41:47.547 --> 41:53.099
to some bays from England walking
together in France on a terrible day.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.939
One minute past the hour.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.479
It's now.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.977
Hutchinson, this is the time, it's now.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.605
To the right, to the right!

42:14.657 --> 42:16.455
We made it.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.331
Thank you, Doctor.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.126
Come on, old chap.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.673
- Leave me. I'm not going to make it.
- Oh, yes you are.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.357
Didn't I promise you
all those years ago?

42:31.424 --> 42:33.973
Now, come on, and that's an order!

42:56.991 --> 43:00.245
They went with songs to the battle.
They were young,

43:00.328 --> 43:05.255
straight of limb, true of eye,
steady and aglow.

43:05.333 --> 43:09.304
They were staunch to the end
against odds uncounted.

43:09.378 --> 43:12.302
They fell with their faces to the foe.

43:13.966 --> 43:18.346
They shall not grow old
as we that are left grow old.

43:19.806 --> 43:24.061
Age shall not weary them
nor the years condemn.

43:25.061 --> 43:28.691
At the going down of the sun
and in the morning,

43:29.357 --> 43:31.610
we will remember them.

43:39.575 --> 43:41.418
Don't blink.

43:41.494 --> 43:43.462
Blink and you're dead.

43:43.830 --> 43:45.707
Don '2' turn your back,

43:45.790 --> 43:49.010
don't look away and don't blink.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.176
Good luck.
