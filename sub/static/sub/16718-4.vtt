WEBVTT

00:23.400 --> 00:25.560
-Dr.  Nolan.
-Hey.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.240
-I have a Halloween date.
-Where do you go?

00:31.400 --> 00:34.960
In a haunted house.  It's called,
"Adeline Kingston's Ghost."

00:35.120 --> 00:37.080
You probably have
no idea who that is.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.880
Adeline Kingston, silent film
star, she stabbed nine people

00:41.040 --> 00:43.800
at the Lamar Theater in
her 20s before killing herself.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.520
-A fan of old movies?
-A fan of old murders.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.640
Where's the hot date?

00:48.960 --> 00:51.400
-His Batmobile is outside.
-Is that your son?

00:51.520 --> 00:55.760
My friend's.  He had to go to
San Diego, I'll take care of him.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.240
- Survive the night first.
-That sounds threatening.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.320
Halloween in Los
Angeles attracts all ghosts.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.440
If we continue to
intubate Mike, it increases

01:06.600 --> 01:09.120
the risk of stenosis and
nosocomial pneumonia.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.080
I want to schedule
a tracheostomy.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.920
What's going on here?

01:14.080 --> 01:15.920
Angus, I went to see Mike.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.680
I just met Dr.
Campbell on visit.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.680
-You didn't have an appointment?
-Not without you, of course.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.920
Do you want to make
a hole in his throat?

01:25.120 --> 01:27.920
Mike is ventilated and has been
intubated for more than 3 weeks.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.840
That's a week longer
than it should be.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.320
Mike showed signs of increased
brain activity just this week.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.640
He breathes spontaneously
and moves purposefully.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.440
I would argue about whether
these were targeted, but

01:39.600 --> 01:42.800
the point is that he can't
do without ventilation.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.920
-I got the same opinion.
-I have researched.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.680
-There was a study...
-Study.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.400
Actually six studies,
done in the UK, with

01:50.520 --> 01:53.400
Mike's requirements.
His chance is up to 30%,

01:53.520 --> 01:55.720
that he will breathe on his
own if we extub him now.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.480
And 70% that he doesn't.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.360
Extubation is risky,
Mike could aspirate.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.760
Tracheotomy is also risky.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.520
This could damage
your thyroid or lungs.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.479
With all due respect,
I've been doing the job

02:10.600 --> 02:13.240
for 20 years and I
know the risks of each.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.040
As Mike's attending physician,
I recommend the tracheotomy,

02:17.160 --> 02:19.600
-to give him more time.
-But I think that...

02:19.760 --> 02:23.640
What?  That a doctor in the 2nd year
knows more than the chief surgeon?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.440
We're talking about
my son, your brother.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.360
Are you going to risk this
because of an internet study?

02:30.560 --> 02:32.400
Or should we
listen to his doctor?

02:34.440 --> 02:35.840
-What do we have here?
-A 21 year old.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.480
Hand injury from blow
through windshield, wounds.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.880
-He had two bags of meth with him.
-He's after me, man.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.680
-Let me go.
-Who is after you?

02:42.800 --> 02:44.800
The devil is chasing me!

02:44.920 --> 02:45.880
The blood pressure is greatly increased.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.760
Let us sedate him
before he lashes out.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.480
- From the initial assessment.
-What do you have there, Guthrie?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.000
A 23-year-old comes with
shortness of breath and a cough

02:52.120 --> 02:53.760
after smoke inhalation.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.320
He has soot in his mouth and nose.
And a dummy knife in the throat.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.840
- He sneezes now and then.
-So, Dr.  Pineda,

02:59.960 --> 03:02.280
-What are you doing?
- Respiratory system burned.  Intubate.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.360
What happened?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.480
A haunted movie theater in downtown L.A.
caught fire.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.880
The Lamar Theater?
There is Dr.  Nolan too.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.760
The fire locked everyone in.
There is chaos there.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.000
What the hell?
She is still a child.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.960
Help, treat grandpa.
He's having a heart attack.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.040
- Probably a heart attack.
-What is your name, honey?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.800
-Erica.  I have to call mom.
-OK.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.520
-I'll call your mom.
-I need a stretcher.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.600
Eloise, please.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.880
Go with the nice sister,
she will take care of it.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.640
Get her mom over here now.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.480
I don't see the vocal cords.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.920
Probably up front,
here, I'm repositioning.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.480
Take care of the table,
sister, we'll get through.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.440
The pulse is weak, the
blood pressure drops.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.280
ST elevation in the
Wilson department.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.520
He has ventricular tachycardia.
Emergency wagon!

03:47.640 --> 03:50.080
The blood pressure
is at 70 over 52 people.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.560
And how does it look now?  OK.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.720
Where are the paddles?
Come on, bring it here.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.760
-The blood pressure is falling rapidly.
-I see you, the tube, please.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.120
-Tube.  The blood pressure drops.
-Come on.  I need the paddles.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.920
-I think I'm in.
-Good, I got it.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.280
Here, a change in color.
Seen?  We made it.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.080
-He won't make it.
-Stop.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.840
Precordial punch.  Old school.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.320
Let's get this out of here.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.560
Three hundred inputs, then
1 ml per minute IV, please.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.480
Let's take him to the
catheterization lab.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.880
It is said that 40 or more people
were injured in the Lamar Theater.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.120
A fire in the cinema?
It'll be full here soon.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.600
-Dr.  Nolan's there.
-I will go there.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.960
Give me interns,
Noa, Elliot, Charlotte.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.360
They come to us anyway.
I volunteer.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.480
Okay, take Noa and Elliot,
but Charlotte stays here.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.480
-Thank you.
-Dr.  Willis.  Pay attention.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.800
Come on guys.  Let's go.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.320
Dr.  Dixon, Dr.  Kean,
you come with me.

05:00.880 --> 05:01.920
-Ethane.
-Amanda?

05:02.040 --> 05:05.840
Thank God.  The emergency call
is overloaded.  The roof collapsed.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.080
- Quiet.  Where are they?
-In the cinema.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.880
I think... oh god!

05:10.040 --> 05:12.440
Ian ran forward.  He's
stuck in a projection booth.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.600
And I call for him,
but he doesn't answer.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.840
-Hello?
-Amanda.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.640
Hello?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.800
-Where are we driving to?
-To the haunted house.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.600
-He comes!  The devil!
-Happy Halloween!

05:47.480 --> 05:48.920
Over here, here.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.360
Forgiveness.  Over here.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.080
Mr. Darwin.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.560
One two...

05:53.680 --> 05:55.920
Man.  That looked real.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.560
I can't get through to Amanda.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.480
Well, we have to go.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.880
People, work fast, work
safely, work together,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.480
don't make mistakes,
don't kill anyone.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.960
Good instructors.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.040
We need a medic here.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.000
Hello Amanda!

06:14.880 --> 06:16.200
Hello!

06:30.520 --> 06:32.840
Hello Amanda!

06:44.600 --> 06:46.440
Is anyone here?

07:10.440 --> 07:12.520
Ian can you hear me

07:12.840 --> 07:13.640
Ian!

07:13.760 --> 07:16.000
-Hello.
-I'm back here.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.880
-Amanda.
-Ethane.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.040
-Oh my God.  Thank god...
-Are you okay?

07:21.200 --> 07:24.480
I'm fine, Ian is
on the other side.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.320
-Ian!
-I have been calling for ages

07:30.480 --> 07:32.880
-he does not answer.
-Does he have a cell phone?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.200
-Yes.
- Let's try it.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.960
Ian!

07:37.320 --> 07:39.520
Ian, please answer us!

07:41.400 --> 07:43.040
Ian can you hear us

07:52.840 --> 07:53.960
I'm here.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.960
-I think...
-Oh, my god.  Oh, buddy.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.520
Answer your cellphone

08:03.520 --> 08:07.760
-Ian, how are you in there?
-My leg is hurt.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.720
Damn it.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.760
-Can you show me?
-Yes.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.360
There is a lot of
blood here and it hurts.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.320
We have to get in there.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.440
That was our only way out.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.640
Tell me when the
blood will come.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.320
-You called me?
-Yes.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.039
We need more help down there.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.799
When can I go back to the operating room?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.880
I know you're still angry
about the ECMO intervention.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.679
-Willis...
-I'm not Willis.

08:43.039 --> 08:46.640
Help the emergency team, simple
operations.  Get me on big things.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.400
Should I get you
for sisters too?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.080
Do you know what your
problem is, Dr.  Pinkney?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.640
Your mouth is
smarter than your head.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.360
It's one of two things
that is holding you back.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.400
-What is the other one?
- Blind ambition.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.080
So you risk the patient's
life and this hospital too.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.280
The next time you don't follow
my instructions, you will fly.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.160
I warned you.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.480
What are you doing there, Dr.  Savetti?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.600
I pull shards of glass out
of the meth junkie's hand.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.600
Give him 2 mg of lorazepam.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.960
Dr.  Campbell, the operating
room needs you upstairs.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.040
Yes I come.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.720
Connect him, he should
go to the waiting room.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.960
Take care of the patients.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.040
He's a patient...

09:22.160 --> 09:24.240
Who is sedated
and not badly injured.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.520
Relocate him.
He should sleep off the intoxication.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.040
He had a heart attack when
he got to the hospital, but

09:31.160 --> 09:34.480
now your father is stable,
he had to go to the cath lab.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
Cath lab?

09:35.720 --> 09:38.080
You want to open your
arteries with small catheters.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.360
Luckily she was here.
She was very brave.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.000
Grandpa fell over when
we did the sweets round.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.840
I called 911 like you showed
us, but it was taking too long.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.560
The doctors told me,
I'm so proud of you.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.760
But you won't drive
again until you're 16, yes?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.600
Tyler where have you been

09:54.720 --> 09:56.920
You should be doing the
rounds with your sister.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.800
I was at a Halloween party.
Grandpa said he does this.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.640
-He had a heart attack!
-Is he alright?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.400
He lives  But not by your doing.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.760
That should have been my fault?

10:07.880 --> 10:10.760
If you had gone with her, it
probably wouldn't have happened.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.800
Or grandpa is old and
this happens to old people.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.800
-All right.
-This is my father.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.920
-Calm down, okay?
-Oh my God.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.280
Just breathe, everything is fine.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.960
-Oh my God.
-We'll get you, Ian.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.240
Please be careful.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.160
There is no handle.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.400
The door is stuck.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.680
Good Ian.  We're going
to stop the bleeding now.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.400
-Do you have a belt on your costume?
-Batmans Utility Belt.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.680
It's made of hard plastic.
It won't work.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.800
Ian, would you take a look
around the room, please?

10:48.920 --> 10:51.880
Find a pen and
an electronic cable.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.240
Or something else to
wrap around your leg.

11:14.040 --> 11:18.200
Oh God!  She hanged
herself in the room.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.520
-This is not real, Ian.
-I'm not afraid.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.480
Amanda, where is my dad?

11:24.600 --> 11:28.960
In San Diego, but he's going
as fast as he can.  Hold on.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.840
Ian, you have to be brave, okay?
Like Batman.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.440
He's not afraid of anything.
Now find the string.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.960
I found a string and a pen.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.400
Great, you're doing great.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.760
Take the string and wrap it
around your leg, above the cut.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.320
And tie a knot.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.360
Okay, now stick
the pen in the knot.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.200
-So?
-Good.  Now turn it twice.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.560
As hard as you can
Feel the string tighten.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.000
Now take the pen and
stick it under to secure it.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.200
Well done Ian.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.960
Has the bleeding decreased?

12:21.200 --> 12:24.080
Now it doesn't bleed
so much anymore.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.400
But my stomach still hurts.

12:27.920 --> 12:33.160
-Your stomach hurts?  Where?
-All over.  Something fell on it.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.240
It sounds stiff.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.040
Dr.  Piel.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.520
What do you want to
treat the patient with?

12:43.640 --> 12:46.280
Albuterol and
Lorazepam, then steroids.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.600
Enter Solu-Medrol,
125 mg by infusion.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.040
Dr.  Piel, please take
care of the waiting room.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.080
It's getting busier outside.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.600
Please do not send
me to the waiting room.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.120
They always ask me for
photos and autographs

13:06.320 --> 13:09.120
and calls me Jessamine, they

13:09.240 --> 13:10.400
see me as a movie
star, not a doctor.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.120
What do you see yourself as?

13:13.480 --> 13:14.680
I am a doctor.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.760
Doctors see patients
everywhere too.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.720
-Come on.
-OK.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.760
A deep soft tissue
bruise around her neck.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.560
This is makeup.  Adeline hanged
herself in the projection room.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.200
You know the story.
Burn victims dehydrate quickly.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.280
She needs fluids.
Let's put an entrance.

13:40.400 --> 13:44.600
Use your cell phone to
show the area that hurts.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.360
Good Ian.  Is the wound
bigger than before?

13:51.600 --> 13:52.560
No idea.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.320
But it hurts a lot more now.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.600
It's a Gray-Turner sign,
retroperitoneal bleeding.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.720
My stomach comes
out like my mom's.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.760
His mother died of
leukemia two years ago.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.640
-Do I have the same thing as her?
-No, we'll get you out

14:06.800 --> 14:08.560
and then we'll make
you well again, okay?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.360
Hang in there, Batman, okay?

14:12.160 --> 14:13.120
Back.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.440
What happened?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.000
The catheter placement did not
work and he has ventricular fibrillation.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.760
-30 minutes.  He can do it.
-Good, let me in.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.080
-Do you want to go here?
-Wait a minute.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.520
Dad?  What about him?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.400
Will you step aside,
please, Eloise?

14:27.720 --> 14:31.800
-Please shock with 200 three times.
-Leanne, this is an emergency.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.760
-Shock again.
-Step away.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.760
I'm busy, Willis.  What's up?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.920
A child, blunt abdominal trauma
and retroperitoneal bleeding.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.840
-No pulse.
-How far are you?

14:41.960 --> 14:43.360
That's why I'm calling.
We're stuck.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.480
And you need to
send me a REBOA kit.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.920
It should be ready as
soon as we are taken out.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.200
I was called.  Is that the
guy waiting for the bypass?

14:50.400 --> 14:52.680
-84 year olds with ventricular fibrillation.
-Step away.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.120
You developed the
"rebore" procedure.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.520
They know how difficult
it is to insert a catheter

14:57.640 --> 14:59.560
into a child's aorta in
an open environment.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.040
"Rebore"?  Whose turn is it?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.800
The child will die if
we don't do it now.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.960
He's losing consciousness.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.640
Leanne, the rebuild kit
has to be ready for me.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.880
-It is on its way.
-Where are you going?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.760
He still has ventricular fibrillation,
shall we try something else?

15:12.880 --> 15:13.840
Some lidocaine.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.960
Dr.  Rorish, I asked
you a question.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.520
Nolan and a kid are
stuck in the burning

15:17.640 --> 15:19.400
movie theater and Willis
went to rescue them.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.640
-Noa and Elliot are there too.
-What?

15:21.760 --> 15:24.680
Fire me  But can we
let him save his life first?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.920
Hopefully one of us can.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.040
-How long has it been?
-33 minutes, 4 gifts Epi.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.560
Stop resuscitation.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.720
Do we want to declare him dead?
Do you have any suggestions?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.640
Time of death is 11:32 p.m.

15:39.760 --> 15:40.720
Yes.

15:43.520 --> 15:48.400
Now I have to get out of there,
tell Cheryl that her father is dead.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.040
What about the rebuild kit?

15:50.280 --> 15:54.160
Sister, bring a rebuild
kit to the Lamar Theater.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.440
Thank you.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.200
Ian, good news.
Help is coming soon.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.760
Ethan what was that?

16:06.280 --> 16:07.600
Amanda!

16:08.080 --> 16:09.200
Ethane...

16:10.400 --> 16:12.560
-Are you getting along?
-Yes, I'm fine, I...

16:12.680 --> 16:14.720
-Do you feel your legs?
-Yes.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.600
You will be fine again.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.320
-I'll get you out of here.
-OK.

16:28.680 --> 16:29.840
-I'm pulling you out.
-OK.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.320
-No everything is fine?

16:32.440 --> 16:33.400
Yes.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.160
Ethane.

16:36.440 --> 16:39.720
Amanda, hello?

16:45.880 --> 16:48.280
-How are you?
-Good.

16:48.960 --> 16:52.720
No, not at all good.
Your rib is shifted.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.640
-Is Ian okay?
-He's weak, but brave.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.400
And you have to be too.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.640
Wait.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.760
Lie back

17:14.319 --> 17:15.599
I'm coming Ian.

17:18.800 --> 17:19.760
Hurry up!

17:19.880 --> 17:22.880
Hang in there, buddy.
I want to break open the door.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.000
-Will you help me?
-It hurts.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.120
Please get me out of here.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.080
I have him.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.640
I got you buddy.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.200
Thank God.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.360
He will be back.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.040
You both.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.760
-The morphine works the same.
-Go away from me.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.480
Please calm down.
We want to help you.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.000
Incredible that I took this job.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.000
I'll tell you one thing.
I fire my agent.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.040
That's the morphine.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.400
You are a great guy, Clark.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.000
Show me Kentucky
and your horses, okay?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.120
No idea.  Just put the access.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.560
Can you do this
without an ultrasound?

18:21.680 --> 18:25.320
I do it according to anatomy.
Like Rorish.  I am in.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.000
Well, let's give
her some liquid.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.320
Oh god, this is not the
vein, this is the artery.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.960
Apply pressure.
We try the other side.

18:45.400 --> 18:49.120
Look at it this way,
everyone has a bad night

18:49.280 --> 18:52.240
here, but you're the
lucky one who can fix it all.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.400
If I were you I
would start there

18:58.760 --> 18:59.720
OK.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.360
You are a cool Jessamine.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.360
Do you really think so?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.400
I know it.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.400
Mom is freaking out.
She doesn't stop crying.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.600
Your father died.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.800
I killed him didn't I?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.640
Come along.
I want to show you something.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.680
Do you see the enlarged lungs?
This is emphysema.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.640
Gary smoked a lot.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.440
And that's his angiogram.
A picture of the heart vessels.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.760
This is the coronary
artery, these are

19:56.880 --> 19:59.400
obstructions all over
here.  That's why he died.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.520
A long hard life.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.320
That's not why he died today.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.120
He died because
I wasn't with him.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.400
Tyler, he could have died
yesterday or tomorrow.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.240
He was a ticking time bomb.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.080
But I should take care of him.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.760
She will always think
it's my fault and hate me.

20:16.240 --> 20:21.600
Tyler, she thinks it's her
fault and hates herself for it.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.400
He loved you so much.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.920
Your grandpa had a good life.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.920
It wasn't your fault.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.080
Nobody is to blame.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.920
-How are you?
-My stomach hurts a lot.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.240
You did well with the
pressure bandage.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.320
You have to hold
out a little longer.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.520
Can you do it?

21:41.240 --> 21:42.640
-Let me help.
-No, it's okay.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.400
-Alright, I'll do it.
-No, I'm fine.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.240
Dr.  Pineda.  Thank you.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.360
-You allow the tracheotomy?
-That seems like the best option.

21:51.760 --> 21:52.880
What about your research?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.360
I know, but the
odds are not good.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.440
That sounded different.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.440
You said chances
were just Mike's taste.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.800
I have no idea what he
would do because he can't tell.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.160
He doesn't have to, that's why he
has you as an authorized representative.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.040
If he can't speak for
himself, you should do it.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.120
What should I do, prescribe

22:05.240 --> 22:06.880
the Angels' chief surgeon?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.760
I don't give a shit about
Campbell, you should be too.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.280
We are talking about
my brother's life.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.200
Do you think i don't know
Or that he didn't know?

22:12.320 --> 22:13.280
He didn't do that arbitrarily.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.960
He got in the car,
drove to a notary, wrote

22:15.120 --> 22:17.560
your name down, not
your dad's or Campbell's.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.520
What are you doing now
with this responsibility?

22:19.640 --> 22:21.280
Do you pass them on to
people who don't deserve them?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.560
That does not concern you.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.480
Apparently not you either, huh?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.960
The morphine works.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.560
-Do you want some?
-No.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.400
Talk to me again.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.480
I'll slide the rib back again.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.400
It affects your lung function.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.600
As tempting as that sounds

22:48.840 --> 22:51.520
I prefer to wait for the operation.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.440
How did you get here

22:56.920 --> 22:58.320
With an ambulance.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.560
Not here.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.400
Here, to L.A.?

23:05.800 --> 23:09.360
Tell me the secret
of Ethan Willis.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.240
I was in Afghanistan.

23:14.880 --> 23:20.560
I heard about a sick child in
a neighboring village, Anwar.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.640
Pathan.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.920
He couldn't get to our base.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.880
His parents were afraid
that he would be seen.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.240
So did you go to him?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.960
No child should die
of appendicitis in 2016.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.720
So I stepped in.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.960
And we succeeded.

23:38.760 --> 23:43.640
Shortly afterwards, the patrol
found his body on the street.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.240
He was shot in the head.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.880
And you tore your seams.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.120
OK.

23:56.240 --> 23:58.760
You think it's your fault

23:59.720 --> 24:01.600
I'm not the animal
that did this to him.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.760
-You feel guilty.
-No, it's not to blame.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.120
It's complicated.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.600
Try it.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.360
Using a child's
body in the middle

24:16.520 --> 24:18.960
of the street to
send us a message

24:19.680 --> 24:21.440
to send me a message...

24:21.800 --> 24:23.960
No American medicine!

24:24.400 --> 24:26.280
Has it put you off?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.880
On the contrary, these
savages didn't scare me.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.120
Against all orders, I
went to every village

24:34.280 --> 24:36.880
and treated anyone
who wanted it.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.880
Until I was caught.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.320
Criminal helper.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.480
You were the Robin
Hood of medicine.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.280
The superiors did
not see it as a helper.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.360
More like an act of resistance.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.440
Was that the case?

24:58.320 --> 24:59.600
But definitely.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.960
Did you hear that?

25:04.160 --> 25:05.320
They are coming.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.360
Hello!

25:08.240 --> 25:09.640
We are in here!

25:10.440 --> 25:12.080
Stay away from the wall.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.840
Amanda?  Amanda!  Amanda, no.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.520
Hold on.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.000
Hey, are you all okay in there?

25:46.680 --> 25:48.440
They are after you...

25:50.920 --> 25:52.720
I need to get out.

26:06.280 --> 26:10.520
-Are you scared?
-Hey, take it easy.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.080
-Take him away from me.
-Stop.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.280
-Take him away.
-Stop.  What?

26:17.640 --> 26:19.840
-All men down.
- Get down!

26:24.520 --> 26:25.480
Did you hear that?

26:25.720 --> 26:28.120
Concentration, Dr.  Pineda,
we have to stop the bleeding.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.800
Go away!

26:38.560 --> 26:40.320
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.200
Everything okay?

26:42.360 --> 26:44.200
Heads down.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.800
Angus, make sure nobody's hurt.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.840
Dr.  Rorish, over here.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.400
-Oh my God.  You...
-Stay down!

26:56.240 --> 26:58.800
-You got shot!
- It's okay, Mommy.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.640
Come on, carry, quickly!

27:10.280 --> 27:11.560
Are you all right?

27:16.200 --> 27:21.040
Jessamine, Jessamine!

27:21.440 --> 27:25.760
It's okay, let's go.

27:25.960 --> 27:26.960
Jessamine!

27:29.640 --> 27:31.400
Someone was shot
in the waiting room.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.520
No movement!
Is the shooter still in action?

27:33.640 --> 27:35.200
No, it seems like they got him.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.280
Out of the way.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.920
Slowly slowly.

27:39.320 --> 27:42.200
- Make space!
-My God.  This is Charlotte.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.880
-What happened?
- Activate mass transfusion.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.520
-The pulse is weak.
-I have to do this now.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.640
-I take over.  Please, Angus.
-I have it.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.680
- Left bullet wound...
- Exit wound.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.480
-Right of the chest.
-Where?

27:53.240 --> 27:54.640
I hear breathing
noises on both sides.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.160
-She needs chest drains.
-I take over this side.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.240
Dr.  Savetti?

27:58.480 --> 28:01.400
Eloise Mornello.  I need 8,
no, 10 units of O negative.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.240
-Blood is on the way.
-The blood pressure is at 64.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.440
Savetti!

28:05.560 --> 28:07.720
I place the tube on the right.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.280
I have to talk to Dr.
Talk to Campbell.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.400
Campbell operates.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.520
He has a blunt abdominal
trauma, retroperitoneal bleeding.

28:21.640 --> 28:22.600
He's having a heart attack.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.320
The operation should be
prepared, open laparotomy.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.360
-For how much longer?
-Fifteen minutes.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.960
-You won't make it.
-But.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.360
I stabilize it with
the help of Rebore.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.840
In the moving ambulance?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.080
If you place the balloon
incorrectly, its aorta will tear.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
Just prepare for the operation.
See you in 15 minutes.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.120
-What's happening?
-What do we have here?

28:43.240 --> 28:44.720
27 year old with
burns all over her body.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.800
I couldn't get in.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.120
I ruined the central
venous catheter.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.160
The hematoma presses on the
airways.  We have to intubate.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.120
Focus on me and the patient.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.320
There is nothing more
important at the moment.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.080
-What happened?
-There was a shootout.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.040
Dr.  Kean...

29:00.640 --> 29:02.680
The blood pressure is at 54.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.680
-Hold the.
-Fully run.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.920
- Heavy bleeding on the left.
-Right too.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.560
She needs a
bilateral thoracotomy.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.000
We have to get her
to the operating room.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.720
No, it is not stable.
Do it here.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.080
I know she's yours,
but she seems stable.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.160
-No.
-She has to get out of here.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.480
-No!
-Stop!

29:23.720 --> 29:26.200
Pull yourself together.
For her.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.640
-She lost her pulse.
-Compressions.  Come on.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.400
The thoracotomy tray, now.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.400
What are you doing?

29:40.520 --> 29:42.240
I insert the balloon
into his aorta to keep

29:42.360 --> 29:44.320
the blood from flowing
into his abdomen.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.480
Did you really do
that in Afghanistan?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.400
-We did that every day.
- So you're good at it?

29:48.520 --> 29:50.000
Fine, Amanda.
Now please listen to me.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.880
This is not the best
place for this serious

29:52.000 --> 29:56.120
procedure, but if we
don't try, we'll lose it.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.640
Don't let the boy die, okay?

29:59.480 --> 30:00.640
I wont.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.280
Hang in there, Ian.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.960
That is 6 cm above the xiphoid,

30:15.000 --> 30:16.600
i think i can get through

30:19.960 --> 30:21.440
You're welcome.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.600
Stop the compressions.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.800
Did it work?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.040
Sixteen... there's blood in it.

30:55.800 --> 30:57.840
Hole in the heart
chamber.  Dr.  Savetti,

30:57.960 --> 30:59.960
put your finger in here
and apply pressure.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.560
Seems like the bullet
hit the hilus.  4-0 seam.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.040
He puts his finger in her heart.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.120
Dr.  Kean, your patient is here.

31:09.840 --> 31:11.800
Dr.  Guthrie, I get on
well with the instrument.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.200
-Shall I try?
-I do that.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.000
I feel it.
In the heart chamber.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.280
You do that?

31:19.400 --> 31:22.160
-It's not beating yet.
-Then we go on.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.600
-Wound spreader, please.
-OK.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.200
-We have a pulse.
-Thank God.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.520
I can feel the aorta.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.240
-Clamp.
-Moment.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.640
I can't stop this bleeding.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.600
Get the operating room
ready, now you are here.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.600
We have a pulse.
It is weak but existent.

31:47.720 --> 31:49.520
- Just watch from above.
-Is the operating room ready?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.080
Yes, but no
surgeon is available.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.000
That's not true, there
are two available.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.920
She and I.  We'll do it quickly.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.640
You don't have OP rights
and I have conditions...

31:56.760 --> 31:58.120
-You know I can't.
-I do not care.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.200
Campbell is going to fire me.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.960
The boy is going to die.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.480
-Are you a surgeon or not?
-I'm destroying my career.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.520
This is your career.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.320
Here, this is the
patient, you are a doctor.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.880
Make up your mind.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.040
He's got at least four
liters of blood in here.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.400
The blood pressure is at 67 over 30.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.360
- More blood, please.
-Ethan, what's up?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.920
Just wait  There
is a little problem.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.720
You pulled through the kidney.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.960
His ileum, his abdominal artery?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.360
He has a heart attack.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.000
We won't lose the boy.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.720
-Down to 42 in systole.
-I need thread.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.280
-We should put the sternum...
-No.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.480
I almost did it.  Print.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.560
-OK?
-Yes.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.400
Scissors.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.880
-Looks good.
-What is the blood pressure like?

33:05.360 --> 33:07.320
Again at 80 to 52.

33:09.640 --> 33:10.960
You did it.

33:22.680 --> 33:26.360
-Dr.  Willis, should I close?
-No, I'll do that.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.000
Thank you.

33:30.280 --> 33:34.040
He survived.  Thank you doctor.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.600
How did you know
there was blood in there?

33:39.720 --> 33:42.480
The hilum is closed, the
bleeding under control.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.760
The heart chambers
are also intact again.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.600
Come back to us, Charlotte, go.

33:46.240 --> 33:47.760
Still no heart activity.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.920
There has to be
something we can do.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.960
It was taking too long.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.440
She lost too much blood.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.360
No, we will take you to the
operating room and place a bypass.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.000
-Dr.  Rorish.
-Get ready for laying.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.480
You know it's too late for that.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.440
No...

34:05.640 --> 34:07.080
We'll declare them dead.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.199
No, I am responsible for you.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.480
Time of death 3:14 p.m.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.159
Can someone make it up, please?

34:32.840 --> 34:33.800
Sorry

34:34.840 --> 34:37.600
I am so sorry.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.680
-It's not your fault.
-Don't say that, it's not true.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.800
We saw where she
hit the bullet, how many

35:22.920 --> 35:25.640
patients with this injury
were we able to save?

35:25.760 --> 35:26.720
Zero.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.240
But I sent her out
to the waiting room.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.360
You didn't send her out to die.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.280
You sent her out
to treat patients.

35:34.880 --> 35:38.440
And if not?  What if we
hadn't fired the junkie?

35:38.840 --> 35:41.040
Or if I had sent
them with Willis?

35:45.960 --> 35:48.760
She is someone's daughter.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.400
Jesse.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.400
I have to call her mother.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.680
Dr.  Pinkney, I just saw
Dr.  Willis downstairs.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.640
If you want to fire me
fine, but wait until tomorrow.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.560
-It was a terrible night.
-I'll give you back the rights.

36:25.240 --> 36:29.200
I don't get it, the last
time I was punished.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.280
Now am i being rewarded?

36:31.520 --> 36:36.080
Last time you did it for
yourself, not this time.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.920
Maybe you're a doctor after all.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.480
I'm sorry about
Charlotte, if anyone

36:45.600 --> 36:46.560
could have saved
her, it was you.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.160
Yes.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.000
Ethane.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.320
-What's up buddy?
-Great.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.600
How are you Dr.  Nolan?

37:11.480 --> 37:12.800
Listen i...

37:13.800 --> 37:15.200
I don't know how to thank you.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.360
-You do not have to.
-But.

37:17.760 --> 37:21.240
If you hadn't been
there for Ian and me...

37:23.880 --> 37:26.440
I was very afraid.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.360
Me too.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.160
I'm very sorry about Charlotte.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.760
Me too.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.560
-Ian.
-John.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.440
Thank god.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.720
-He's fine.  Both of us.
-Oh my God.  Amanda.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.360
I know.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.360
-I'll let you talk.
-No, John.

37:47.480 --> 37:51.640
This is Dr.  Willis.
He saved Ian and me.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.440
Thank you.  I don't know
what I'd do if I'd lost her.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.600
That should never happen.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.400
-Wait.
-Dad, we talked about it.

38:17.720 --> 38:20.960
Son, if something should
happen to your brother

38:21.160 --> 38:23.960
as a result, do you want to
take this guilt on yourself?

38:24.480 --> 38:25.640
No.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.800
But that's what Mike wanted.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.880
-No spontaneous breathing yet.
-Stop.

38:51.640 --> 38:54.440
Stop doing that!
We can reconnect it.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.600
He didn't have to breathe
alone for several weeks.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.600
It takes time for his
body to know what to do.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.760
If its saturation doesn't
drop below 80, then all is well.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.080
We are at 89, falling.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.760
Leanne, please.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.240
Come on, Mike.  Please breathe.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.480
Come on you can do it, Mike.
Come on, Mike.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.240
-OK.  I have to step in.
- Go on, Mike.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.080
You have to breathe.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.440
Angus, get out of there.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.720
No wait.  Come on.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.000
-You're welcome.
-Come on.
