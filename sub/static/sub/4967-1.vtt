01:40.850 --> 01:42.317
Range is 120.

01:42.518 --> 01:44.748
Closing 785 per second.

02:07.209 --> 02:10.440
Looks like a Y-class freighter
on the starboard fringe.

02:10.513 --> 02:11.571
Code?

02:11.647 --> 02:15.447
ZP-183. She's lined up perfectly.

02:20.523 --> 02:22.150
Laser shields on.

02:24.026 --> 02:25.926
Let's get it over with.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.765
Looks good.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.500
Seal it up.

04:19.642 --> 04:21.632
- Let me get it.
- I got it.

04:22.344 --> 04:24.244
Will you let me get it?

04:51.140 --> 04:52.573
Take care of him.

04:52.641 --> 04:55.007
Yeah, sure. Take care of him.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.704
Take care of him.

05:02.151 --> 05:03.778
Take care of him.

05:04.487 --> 05:05.647
You take care of him.

05:05.721 --> 05:07.348
Take care of him.

05:08.858 --> 05:10.018
Sorry.

05:30.646 --> 05:32.079
What's going on?

05:32.147 --> 05:33.239
Got a bad program.

05:33.315 --> 05:34.805
We always have bad programs.

05:34.884 --> 05:38.479
Fifteen gallons says our robots
can beat anything they got on this ship.

05:38.554 --> 05:40.181
He's coming back.

06:05.047 --> 06:06.708
What's going on here?

06:06.782 --> 06:09.114
- Who are you people?
- Maintenance, ma'am.

06:09.184 --> 06:11.550
You don't belong on this ship. Guard!

06:13.355 --> 06:14.583
Come on.

06:26.435 --> 06:27.902
Whose quarters are these?

06:27.970 --> 06:31.030
Princess Karina of Argon, you pirate...

06:42.117 --> 06:44.210
Everything all right, madam?

06:47.289 --> 06:48.449
Go on.

06:48.891 --> 06:51.792
Yes, thank you. Everything's fine.

06:52.294 --> 06:54.262
I thought I saw a mouse.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.397
Would you like me
to check on it for you, madam?

06:57.466 --> 06:59.957
No, thank you. That won't be necessary.

07:00.035 --> 07:03.198
Just the raving imagination
of an old woman.

07:05.941 --> 07:07.408
By the by...

07:54.023 --> 07:55.081
Come on, let's go.

07:55.157 --> 07:57.819
- She's a real princess.
- Good. Let's go.

07:57.893 --> 08:00.293
Maybe we should take her with us.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.327
For the ransom.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.229
Jason, you promised you wouldn't do this.

08:04.299 --> 08:05.596
It's all clear.

08:06.502 --> 08:07.662
I'll say.

08:07.736 --> 08:09.260
She's beautiful.

08:09.338 --> 08:10.805
What a waste.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.038
Farewell, my beauty.

08:23.218 --> 08:25.846
What happened to "we rape, we pillage"?

08:26.088 --> 08:30.024
Tell Your Highness she just slept
through the finest moment of her life.

08:41.169 --> 08:42.398
Goodbye.

08:53.982 --> 08:56.542
Spring water. I can smell it from here.

08:56.685 --> 08:59.848
Just take a look at that. I'm retiring.

08:59.922 --> 09:02.618
Retiring? Let's just get the ice first.

09:06.762 --> 09:08.354
He's all yours, Maida.

09:08.430 --> 09:10.762
Let him go. Just get down there.

09:17.973 --> 09:19.235
Let's go!

09:26.648 --> 09:28.775
Pirates! Sound the alarm!

09:29.985 --> 09:31.714
Sorry to interrupt.

09:33.122 --> 09:34.749
Thanks very much.

09:36.959 --> 09:38.688
I just stole those!

09:43.232 --> 09:44.494
Get them!

09:49.772 --> 09:51.797
I guess we got you pegged.

09:53.675 --> 09:54.801
Everything okay?

09:54.877 --> 09:56.367
Yeah. Come on.

10:03.318 --> 10:05.081
Jason, it's in here.

10:12.461 --> 10:13.689
Get him out of here!

10:13.762 --> 10:15.354
My hand! Don't forget my hand!

10:15.430 --> 10:17.728
Use the robots! Use them!

10:19.635 --> 10:21.068
Get in there. Attack him.

10:21.136 --> 10:24.469
Get in there. Come on, you next.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.337
Let's get him!

10:27.976 --> 10:30.501
I'm on your side, you piece of junk!

10:33.549 --> 10:35.642
How much do we pay for these things?

10:35.717 --> 10:37.150
That's a TX-40.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.450
It's more money
than all of ours put together. Attack him!

10:40.589 --> 10:42.056
I want my money back!

10:42.124 --> 10:43.648
Watch your leg!

10:46.328 --> 10:50.264
Attack. Not me, you idiot! Him.
Get in there. Come on.

10:50.332 --> 10:52.527
Come on, coward, move. Get in there.

10:52.935 --> 10:54.960
Get in there. Get him, jump him.

10:55.037 --> 10:56.334
Move!

10:56.405 --> 10:58.032
Chop him. Get in there.

11:00.709 --> 11:04.873
Swing. Jump. Kick. Sixty-two. Four. Good.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.516
Attack him, hit him,
work him, get in there.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.212
Jump him. Yeah, take him.

11:11.286 --> 11:13.186
What you looking at? Pop him.

11:14.289 --> 11:17.156
Hit him, do what I told you to do!
Watch your neck.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.087
Yeah! He tries harder.

11:23.165 --> 11:26.100
Little guys try harder. Why am I so tired?

11:35.244 --> 11:36.575
Come here.

11:38.647 --> 11:40.114
You, come on.

11:46.054 --> 11:47.783
You see down there?

12:18.654 --> 12:20.815
Power off in C section, sir.

12:20.889 --> 12:23.323
Check it on the auxiliary system.

12:25.193 --> 12:26.785
It's a negative.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.762
Nobody move. Hands on your heads.

12:30.832 --> 12:32.231
Get them up.

12:32.401 --> 12:35.029
- Warriors.
- Tell them to stop.

12:38.607 --> 12:40.905
Call them off or I'll kill you.

12:41.176 --> 12:43.406
- I mean it.
- Cease.

12:45.213 --> 12:46.578
Very funny.

12:50.319 --> 12:52.014
It's all yours, laddies.

12:59.461 --> 13:01.861
Come on! Move it! Let's get out of here!

13:11.206 --> 13:13.538
- You want a lizard's leg?
- Yeah.

13:23.618 --> 13:25.779
So how long has the Princess
been on board?

13:25.854 --> 13:29.153
You'd be well-advised
to stay clear of Her Ladyship.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.623
She didn't look dangerous to me.

13:45.374 --> 13:46.932
They'll blow up the whole damn ship!

13:47.009 --> 13:49.842
I'm not going to blow up the ship.
Time to leave.

13:50.479 --> 13:52.606
248, get him! Go, go!

13:54.750 --> 13:56.547
Doing it by the book again.

13:56.685 --> 13:58.983
Look, pal, let's just get out of here.

14:06.928 --> 14:08.020
Wait!

14:14.369 --> 14:16.564
You all right?
What the hell are you doing?

14:16.638 --> 14:18.663
Come on. This way.

14:18.907 --> 14:20.169
This way!

14:23.211 --> 14:25.304
We didn't give them enough time.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.679
We got 2 million gallons, minimum.
I guarantee it.

14:32.921 --> 14:34.718
Keep going. I'll catch up.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.621
There's a whole fleet out there.

14:36.691 --> 14:38.989
I'll meet you at the interlock.

14:39.127 --> 14:40.458
Come on.

14:41.530 --> 14:43.395
Keep up the good work.

14:46.234 --> 14:49.692
I know you're all wrapped up,
but this will only take a second.

15:14.896 --> 15:17.160
What the hell's going on? Where's Jason?

15:17.232 --> 15:18.392
Guess.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.200
Not the girl?

15:20.268 --> 15:23.066
God damn it, he's gonna get us all killed.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.399
He's dead. Let's get out of here.

15:27.476 --> 15:28.773
Come on!

15:33.982 --> 15:35.916
They're into the ice hold. Come on.

15:35.984 --> 15:37.952
- Nanny?
- Sorry.

15:38.286 --> 15:39.583
Nanny?

15:39.654 --> 15:41.815
Make way. Excuse me. Make way.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.790
- Who are you?
- Fire drill, ma'am.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.326
Women and humans first.

15:45.393 --> 15:48.089
Stop them, you fools! He's one of them!

15:48.396 --> 15:49.920
Come, this way!

15:50.532 --> 15:54.093
I don't know who you are, sir,
but I demand that you put me down!

15:56.338 --> 15:57.737
Put me down!

15:59.441 --> 16:00.806
I'll bite it off!

16:00.876 --> 16:02.537
I'll cut it off!

16:02.611 --> 16:04.738
Always losing his head over women.

16:04.946 --> 16:08.438
I'll have every ship in the Galaxy
after your filthy hides!

16:08.517 --> 16:11.384
- They already are.
- Put me down, you stupid fellow!

16:16.858 --> 16:20.123
Alarm from the freighter Metterak, sir.
They report pirates on board.

16:20.195 --> 16:22.755
Set converging course.
Sound battle stations.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.429
You were given extra ships...

16:24.499 --> 16:26.592
to destroy the pirates
in this sector, Captain.

16:26.668 --> 16:28.829
One extra squadron, sir.

16:29.404 --> 16:31.838
There are thousands of planets
in this area alone...

16:31.907 --> 16:33.135
where they can hide.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.540
Is it a lack of ships, Commander...

16:36.545 --> 16:38.342
or a lack of resolve?

16:39.347 --> 16:41.645
Pirate craft identified on Metterak, sir.

16:41.716 --> 16:44.879
Arm all batteries. Prepare to fire.

16:56.731 --> 16:58.961
- How's your stump?
- Depressing.

16:59.267 --> 17:00.427
- Warships closing.
- Distance?

17:00.502 --> 17:01.526
Thank you.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.127
Sixteen seconds.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.469
- Reciprocal course.
- You're kidding.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.098
We're going right at them.

17:07.175 --> 17:08.608
Right at them.

17:11.313 --> 17:13.508
That ship looks big enough
to survive a collision.

17:13.582 --> 17:15.516
The control room and Commander won't.

17:15.584 --> 17:16.608
Fire all batteries.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.118
The speed of convergence
will trap us in the blasts.

17:19.221 --> 17:21.712
- He's not changing course.
- Neither are we.

17:24.226 --> 17:25.954
Collision danger, six seconds.

17:26.027 --> 17:28.290
Five seconds. Four seconds.

17:28.363 --> 17:31.560
- Three seconds. Two seconds.
- Alter course to starboard.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.403
Spring water for supper?

17:41.476 --> 17:44.968
Reduce speed to Green 4.
Initiate evasive tactics, Delta pattern.

17:45.046 --> 17:47.844
- They're already on to that pattern.
- Is the new one ready?

17:47.916 --> 17:49.975
Better ask our computer expert.

17:50.051 --> 17:52.576
I haven't quite...

17:53.555 --> 17:55.284
I think they've found us.

17:56.424 --> 17:59.621
Spin left, arm main batteries.
We better take separate pods.

17:59.694 --> 18:01.855
- Good luck.
- See you in Zagora.

18:07.269 --> 18:08.600
Spin left.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.297
Prepare to break.

18:12.374 --> 18:13.363
Now.

18:19.114 --> 18:20.581
Spin to port.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.943
Spin to port!

18:24.019 --> 18:26.715
It's not happening.
The directionals are out.

18:26.788 --> 18:29.120
Why do they always follow our section?

18:29.190 --> 18:31.283
It's up to you, partner.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.162
Templar pigs.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.824
Here they come.

18:43.738 --> 18:45.933
Get that one there. Good!

18:46.007 --> 18:48.840
Here comes another one. Get him.
Great. All right! Over here.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.241
Quit that!

18:53.548 --> 18:55.641
That one, get him.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.014
You missed him.

19:15.837 --> 19:17.634
Take her out of here!

19:24.312 --> 19:26.212
If you resist...

19:26.448 --> 19:31.385
we shall kill everyone on board,
including the wounded.

19:33.021 --> 19:34.488
Call him off.

19:35.724 --> 19:36.986
Back off!

19:37.092 --> 19:38.423
Take them.

19:39.461 --> 19:43.056
Even your robots are insolent.

19:49.637 --> 19:53.004
Fortunately, your days of amusement...

19:53.441 --> 19:55.671
are coming to an end.

20:00.281 --> 20:02.545
Killing you would be too easy.

20:02.817 --> 20:05.911
I have something better in mind for you.

20:09.224 --> 20:11.590
More.

20:11.659 --> 20:14.150
- You missed me.
- More!

20:20.034 --> 20:22.434
- All right, back off there!
- I didn't get any.

20:22.504 --> 20:23.937
Is that all?

20:26.107 --> 20:28.803
- Here, power to the people, man.
- There you go.

20:30.412 --> 20:31.845
More for me.

20:33.214 --> 20:35.239
Jason, you want your soup?

20:36.117 --> 20:37.141
No.

20:49.364 --> 20:52.561
Give you this gold piece
for half the soup.

20:52.934 --> 20:54.799
Food's more important.

20:55.103 --> 20:56.434
Tell you what I'll do.

20:56.504 --> 21:00.338
I'll let you have it
for a quarter of what you got left there.

21:02.410 --> 21:04.571
Okay. Deal.

21:04.946 --> 21:06.413
Hide it well.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.915
What you in for?

21:12.987 --> 21:14.921
Petty theft, grand larceny.

21:16.424 --> 21:18.892
You son of a bitch! Where's my necklace?

21:19.127 --> 21:23.393
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Don't you lie to me, you little punk!

21:23.598 --> 21:26.123
Hey, he said he doesn't have it.

21:26.334 --> 21:28.461
Maybe you dropped it or something.

21:30.238 --> 21:32.069
Maybe you took it!

21:32.140 --> 21:35.132
Maybe. Do you want to go ahead
and search me?

21:35.844 --> 21:38.176
You want to go ahead
and search everyone here?

21:38.246 --> 21:42.148
- I'm sure no one would mind.
- That's a lot of people to search.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.743
They're not going
to let you keep it anyway.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.288
We've all got the same sentence, remember?

21:50.225 --> 21:53.558
If I catch the son of a bitch,
I'll kill him anyway.

22:01.503 --> 22:04.336
It's always the same in the slave section.

22:04.973 --> 22:06.634
The closer we get to Mithra...

22:06.708 --> 22:10.337
the more everyone gets to thinking
about being redesigned.

22:10.578 --> 22:11.772
Redesigned?

22:11.846 --> 22:14.406
Yeah, castrated. Lobotomized.

22:14.716 --> 22:17.708
It's a new process.
They say it doesn't hurt.

22:19.721 --> 22:22.554
They do that to everybody in this section?

22:23.992 --> 22:26.426
Yeah, everyone except for the Monk.

22:26.494 --> 22:29.395
They don't castrate clergy, just in case.

22:29.631 --> 22:31.098
Just in case what?

22:31.165 --> 22:33.531
Just in case there really is a God.

22:37.872 --> 22:39.772
Look. There it is.

22:40.508 --> 22:42.772
- Mithra.
- It's the water planet.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.837
It's the water planet.

22:45.914 --> 22:47.506
Look at the lakes.

22:47.582 --> 22:49.914
God, I can smell them from here.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.585
They're not lakes, they're fields.

22:53.054 --> 22:56.319
They keep the water covered
so it doesn't evaporate.

22:56.391 --> 23:00.157
There still must be plenty of it
to waste on fields like that.

23:00.228 --> 23:01.217
Not when you consider...

23:01.296 --> 23:03.560
it's the only source of water
left in the Galaxy.

23:20.882 --> 23:23.976
If we get out of this,
that's it. I'm quitting.

23:26.220 --> 23:28.188
There's no way we're getting out of this.

23:28.256 --> 23:31.191
If we do,
I'm going to start my own business.

23:31.726 --> 23:34.160
- We've already got our own business.
- Legitimate.

23:34.228 --> 23:36.958
- Legitimate? Doing what?
- Making robots.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.631
But you aren't very good at that.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.794
- People are making a fortune with them.
- I know.

23:41.970 --> 23:45.030
- What are you going to use for water?
- Investors.

23:45.106 --> 23:47.267
People with water don't have to invest.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.207
They already got everything they want.

23:49.277 --> 23:51.768
That's why we're pirates, remember?

23:52.647 --> 23:55.047
I'd rather not talk to you, okay?

24:06.494 --> 24:08.086
Royal scum.

24:08.162 --> 24:09.595
What do you know about her?

24:09.664 --> 24:13.293
She's the daughter of His Lordship,
Count Vasco of Argon.

24:13.668 --> 24:14.657
The explorer?

24:14.736 --> 24:17.967
He disappeared three months ago,
searching for the seventh world.

24:18.039 --> 24:21.497
Seventh world?
Still chasing that old wives' tale?

24:24.312 --> 24:28.840
She's being honored at the royal court
in memory of her beloved father.

24:28.916 --> 24:31.578
She doesn't even know they killed him.

24:32.053 --> 24:35.511
- Who killed him?
- Templars. May they all end in thirst.

24:36.357 --> 24:38.120
Power to the people!

24:44.732 --> 24:46.666
Stand clear.

24:46.734 --> 24:47.996
Monk.

24:48.302 --> 24:51.237
Good luck, my sons. Remember, God saves.

24:56.444 --> 24:57.672
You mean it?

25:13.127 --> 25:14.822
Power to the people!

25:14.896 --> 25:16.227
Walk off your jobs!

25:16.297 --> 25:17.855
Turn off your machines!

25:17.932 --> 25:20.127
Workers unite!

25:24.338 --> 25:26.863
Say, you get your overtime last week?

25:26.941 --> 25:29.671
No. And they cheated me out of two hours.

25:29.744 --> 25:33.145
If they don't pay us soon,
I'm gonna do something drastic.

25:33.214 --> 25:34.909
But not now, please.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.684
I'll need two of those, please.

26:14.756 --> 26:17.850
Hi. Any chance you can help me
get out of this?

26:17.992 --> 26:19.050
Sorry.

26:20.428 --> 26:23.124
Maybe we can just get together
later, then.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.693
I don't think you'll be up for it.

26:28.269 --> 26:29.395
Oh, God.

26:29.470 --> 26:31.199
Turn off your machines!

26:31.272 --> 26:33.069
Walk off your jobs!

26:33.141 --> 26:34.631
Power to the people!

26:35.143 --> 26:37.634
I never thought anything like this
was gonna happen!

26:37.712 --> 26:40.340
Relax, be cool, and whatever you do...

26:40.548 --> 26:41.947
don't panic.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.287
Just pretend that it happened.

27:08.442 --> 27:10.876
Do as you're told or it will happen.

27:11.612 --> 27:12.704
What?

27:20.655 --> 27:24.284
Look alert there.
Thank you. I'll take over from here.

27:27.461 --> 27:28.689
How does that feel?

27:28.763 --> 27:29.991
Perfect, madam, thank you.

27:30.064 --> 27:32.089
Good. Step down and stand over there.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.531
Yes, ma'am.

27:39.273 --> 27:40.900
How does that feel?

27:40.975 --> 27:42.772
- A little snug.
- Good.

27:43.344 --> 27:45.642
Step down and stand over there.

27:47.715 --> 27:50.377
This is where the completed units
are finally inspected...

27:50.451 --> 27:52.146
and shipped to the retailers.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.620
Turn around and present yourselves.

27:54.689 --> 27:55.917
Your Highness, may I?

27:55.990 --> 27:59.357
Thank you.
They are fine-looking specimens.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.753
Yes. Sometimes I think
it's a shame that they...

28:04.298 --> 28:06.994
do all the things that they do to them.

28:07.235 --> 28:09.760
Now, I don't know
what your personal preference is...

28:09.837 --> 28:13.830
but this one
has excellent form and definition.

28:13.908 --> 28:16.138
- May I?
- Certainly.

28:19.347 --> 28:22.316
- He also looks a lot younger than that one.
- Definitely.

28:22.383 --> 28:24.283
And more intelligent.

28:24.418 --> 28:27.216
Basically, they're all the same
when it comes to that.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.654
- What about the black ones?
- Oh, yes.

28:29.724 --> 28:32.124
We found them to be very popular.

28:33.094 --> 28:34.652
So what do you think, then, Nanny?

28:34.729 --> 28:37.698
I think we should
take the black one, definitely.

28:37.765 --> 28:40.598
He'll go very well with the new wallpaper.

28:40.968 --> 28:45.132
As far as the others are concerned,
I don't think it really matters.

28:46.107 --> 28:48.541
Then, I suppose we'll take...

28:50.378 --> 28:51.640
this one.

28:52.179 --> 28:55.478
He's certainly not the
biggest or the best...

28:55.650 --> 28:57.982
but that won't matter in the sewage plant.

28:58.052 --> 28:59.076
That's true.

28:59.153 --> 29:00.313
Excellent, then.

29:00.388 --> 29:04.085
If you'll step this way, I'll give you
the service manuals and contract forms.

29:04.158 --> 29:06.126
This way, Your Highness.

29:09.030 --> 29:11.396
The Princess will explain later
why she saved you.

29:11.465 --> 29:13.831
In the meanwhile,
you will work as her slaves.

29:13.901 --> 29:18.497
Any failure to behave as you're expected,
and I shall take great personal pleasure...

29:18.940 --> 29:23.309
in seeing that what remains
of your masculinity...

29:23.744 --> 29:25.712
is removed forever.

29:27.448 --> 29:29.075
Do you understand?

29:29.150 --> 29:30.515
Yes, ma'am.

29:31.452 --> 29:32.646
Yes, ma'am.

29:32.753 --> 29:34.380
Come along, then.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.933
- She say anything yet?
- Who?

30:28.442 --> 30:29.932
The Princess.

30:30.011 --> 30:32.241
No. I got to get back to work.

30:34.849 --> 30:36.407
Bastards.

30:36.484 --> 30:39.419
Ledova, where you been? Come on up!

30:39.487 --> 30:42.718
- You could've waited for me.
- Ledova, come on up here!

30:47.928 --> 30:49.896
You ought to try it. You'll like it.

30:49.964 --> 30:51.431
I'm trying to quit.

30:53.801 --> 30:55.029
Bye-bye.

30:59.907 --> 31:03.035
You're not supposed to care
about that anymore, remember?

31:12.486 --> 31:14.920
A splendid party, my dear.

31:15.089 --> 31:16.784
I congratulate you.

31:16.857 --> 31:18.119
I'm glad you think so.

31:18.192 --> 31:19.853
Isn't that the...

31:20.561 --> 31:23.394
The pirates.
I bought them this morning at the factory.

31:23.464 --> 31:25.694
I couldn't resist when I saw them
in the showroom.

31:25.766 --> 31:27.256
I can imagine.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.861
They make fine slaves, don't you think?

31:29.937 --> 31:32.770
- Slave, check this robot.
- Yes, sir.

31:33.507 --> 31:34.906
Right here.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.113
Hey, I said, over here.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.449
Okay, don't get tense. That's a good spot.

31:49.523 --> 31:50.683
May I?

31:51.992 --> 31:55.621
And do you think you could
get me a sandwich or something?

31:56.597 --> 31:58.189
What are you doing here?

31:58.265 --> 32:01.325
Just spreading the good word
and trying to save my ass.

32:03.003 --> 32:04.027
What's going on?

32:04.105 --> 32:05.868
- Don't do that!
- Hi.

32:09.376 --> 32:11.139
She wants to see us.

32:12.346 --> 32:15.076
She's planning on leaving or something.

32:17.051 --> 32:19.144
He wants us to bring him a sandwich.

32:19.220 --> 32:21.950
Or some cake. Anything with sugar in it.

32:36.971 --> 32:39.667
We have exactly half an hour
to get to the launching pad.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.173
Where are we going?

32:41.242 --> 32:43.233
You're taking me to the pirates' moon.

32:43.310 --> 32:44.800
It's not a pretty place for a lady.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.439
No doubt,
but I have important business there.

32:47.515 --> 32:49.107
Princess Karina!

32:50.851 --> 32:53.285
Can I speak with you for a moment?

32:54.655 --> 32:55.883
Come on.

32:56.557 --> 32:57.751
Guards!

32:59.894 --> 33:00.918
This way.

33:00.995 --> 33:02.360
Stop them!

33:02.963 --> 33:04.590
Care for a drink?

33:06.800 --> 33:07.892
Stop!

33:08.903 --> 33:09.995
Halt!

33:19.580 --> 33:20.604
This way.

33:20.681 --> 33:22.876
Wait for me! Coming your way!

33:26.887 --> 33:28.149
Let's go.

33:28.822 --> 33:30.722
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

33:33.761 --> 33:35.251
Slow down, Jas!

33:39.099 --> 33:40.862
Jas, let me up here!

33:45.339 --> 33:47.773
Jas, don't forget about me, buddy!

33:58.519 --> 33:59.679
Baby.

33:59.753 --> 34:01.152
Mommy.

34:02.590 --> 34:04.455
Baby. Mommy.

34:05.659 --> 34:07.456
Jas, get me...

34:11.665 --> 34:13.929
Let's get out of here! Come on!

34:14.001 --> 34:16.936
Wait up for me. Don't go so fast.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.206
Hey, Jas!

34:27.281 --> 34:30.216
Hey, bloods.
Y'all want to pump some kitties?

34:30.284 --> 34:32.275
- Yeah.
- No.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.480
Hey, it's been a long time.

34:34.554 --> 34:36.284
Finest kitties on Mithra.

34:36.357 --> 34:38.552
No. Get the hell out of here.

34:38.692 --> 34:41.388
Transportation and exotic cribs
be included.

34:41.462 --> 34:44.158
Yeah, bloods.
These mamas transport your asses...

34:44.231 --> 34:45.822
Transportation.

34:45.899 --> 34:48.493
We take water, gold...

34:48.569 --> 34:51.367
credit cards, and high-priced-type drugs.

34:52.606 --> 34:55.199
- Yeah.
- I heard that. You got the deal.

34:55.275 --> 34:59.474
Let's go, bloods. This be my bad chariot.

34:59.947 --> 35:03.007
Did they at any time
say where they were going?

35:04.385 --> 35:06.512
Did you hear what they said?

35:06.920 --> 35:09.445
Well, what did they say?

35:11.292 --> 35:14.853
They really must try
and teach these things how to speak.

35:21.802 --> 35:24.703
Couldn't you just tell me, a ship?

35:25.472 --> 35:27.667
- Range and bearings?
- 3-2-4.

35:27.741 --> 35:29.572
- Cross-tracking air?
- Check.

35:29.643 --> 35:32.168
Corrected velocity? What the hell is that?

35:38.018 --> 35:39.042
Ouija game.

35:39.119 --> 35:42.418
Forget that and program the course.
Seven seconds.

35:43.791 --> 35:45.759
Don't give them an inch.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.459
- Two, one...
- Clear.

35:51.832 --> 35:53.857
- Anything on radar?
- No. Why?

35:53.934 --> 35:55.401
It all seemed too easy to me.

35:55.469 --> 35:57.437
- Anything?
- No. All clear.

35:57.504 --> 35:59.096
- Except for him.
- What's "him"?

35:59.173 --> 36:02.904
This little thing?
He's just the ship's garbage robot. Look.

36:08.515 --> 36:11.507
Congratulations, ladies.
You're now bona fide pirates.

36:11.585 --> 36:15.112
Should be in Zagora in about three days.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.317
- Do you know this man?
- Yeah.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.652
That's an old friend of mine.

36:21.729 --> 36:23.822
What do you know about him?

36:24.765 --> 36:28.496
His name is Lanky Nibs.
A rabble-rouser from the midsection.

36:28.635 --> 36:30.933
- Can you arrange for me to see him?
- Why?

36:31.004 --> 36:32.232
It's a private matter.

36:32.306 --> 36:33.637
Tough guy to deal with.

36:33.707 --> 36:36.505
He's a pirate. I'm sure he can be bought.

36:37.811 --> 36:39.836
And what do you intend to buy him with?

36:39.913 --> 36:41.813
The water on this ship.

36:42.349 --> 36:45.284
- You've got three problems there.
- Which are?

36:45.986 --> 36:47.476
Your partners.

36:47.821 --> 36:50.119
I do believe we have the controlling vote.

36:50.190 --> 36:52.784
This ship and everything on it
belongs to me.

36:53.227 --> 36:55.491
- Not anymore.
- Wrong.

36:57.965 --> 37:01.526
You don't actually think we believe
you're going to use that, do you?

37:01.602 --> 37:02.967
You should.

37:03.437 --> 37:06.065
- Who's going to fly this ship?
- I will.

37:06.974 --> 37:09.238
Find the pirate moon all by yourself?

37:09.309 --> 37:12.301
He's already fed the course
into the computer.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.273
I can always find it again.

37:21.121 --> 37:22.679
I still don't think you'll use it.

37:22.756 --> 37:25.190
Is that because
you consider yourself so charming...

37:25.259 --> 37:27.625
that this Galaxy
couldn't survive without you?

37:27.694 --> 37:30.322
Or is it simply because
you're too stupid to realize...

37:30.397 --> 37:33.093
just how close to dying you really are?

37:34.168 --> 37:36.193
I like the first one, don't you?

37:36.770 --> 37:38.067
I think she means it.

37:38.138 --> 37:41.073
Let me make our relationship
perfectly clear.

37:42.109 --> 37:45.476
You will do exactly as I say
until we reach Zagora.

37:45.712 --> 37:48.306
I've taken the precaution
of reprogramming the vid...

37:48.382 --> 37:51.010
so that if anyone tampers
with the water on board...

37:51.084 --> 37:53.279
this ship will self-destruct.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.481
Percy, keep an eye on them.

37:56.557 --> 37:57.922
Yes, ma 'am.

38:03.397 --> 38:05.592
What can you do with the vid?

38:08.902 --> 38:10.893
Nothing. Can't touch it.

38:14.107 --> 38:15.631
- Percy?
- Yes, sir.

38:16.109 --> 38:17.906
Bet you're a real tough guy, aren't you?

38:17.978 --> 38:20.139
Let me demonstrate.

39:00.721 --> 39:02.382
Identify yourself.

39:02.589 --> 39:05.057
Your humble servant Zorn, my lord.

39:19.239 --> 39:20.638
Come closer.

39:23.544 --> 39:25.136
Closer.

39:31.418 --> 39:33.613
They want me to disconnect.

39:35.455 --> 39:37.047
Give up my body.

39:39.293 --> 39:42.319
I can still feel with it.

39:44.331 --> 39:49.098
After all these eons, I still feel.

39:51.838 --> 39:53.499
Give me your hand.

40:01.782 --> 40:03.374
What other news?

40:04.718 --> 40:07.209
Princess Karina...

40:07.955 --> 40:10.651
escaped in the warship as planned.

40:12.626 --> 40:14.719
Like father, like daughter.

40:16.096 --> 40:18.530
Genes are a compelling force.

40:20.534 --> 40:23.162
You must be forever vigilant, Zorn.

40:24.838 --> 40:26.999
We cannot fail in this matter.

40:27.074 --> 40:31.340
Everything is proceeding as planned,
my lord.

40:40.654 --> 40:44.681
Base One, this is 2-PQ. Frequency 5-JD-3.

40:47.661 --> 40:52.121
Base One, this is 2-PQ. Frequency 5-JD-3.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.564
Late of the Eagle.

40:53.634 --> 40:56.467
JD-3, ID's correct. How's that?

40:56.536 --> 40:59.198
A little static, but not bad.
How are things in Zagora?

40:59.272 --> 41:02.298
Drying up. You're the first deep spacer in,
in three months.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.139
- Hope you're loaded.
- That's a negative.

41:04.211 --> 41:07.044
- Did the Eagle return?
- Yeah, what was left of her.

41:07.114 --> 41:08.741
- What happened?
- I don't know.

41:08.815 --> 41:11.545
Must have been pretty bad.
They went straight to the bar.

41:11.618 --> 41:14.951
Templars have wiped out half the
pirate fleet in the past six months.

41:15.022 --> 41:19.550
Things are getting bad.
If you have any water on board, be careful.

41:20.093 --> 41:21.856
Thanks, Beak. Any other news?

41:21.928 --> 41:26.490
Nothing much. Another group of pioneers
went out to find the seventh world.

41:26.633 --> 41:29.431
- And?
- They were decimated in the time warp.

41:29.503 --> 41:31.130
Only the kids made it back...

41:31.204 --> 41:34.037
and most of them were too old
to even walk.

41:47.721 --> 41:50.485
...tuned to beacon Z-4.

41:51.091 --> 41:54.026
- See you in a couple of hours.
- Thanks, Beak.

42:15.982 --> 42:17.745
- What?
- You put that on me?

42:17.818 --> 42:19.251
- What?
- That thing!

42:19.319 --> 42:21.947
What thing?
What the hell are you talking about?

42:22.022 --> 42:24.582
Something jumped on me
when I was sleeping.

42:24.658 --> 42:26.683
- What's that on your back?
- What's on my back?

42:26.760 --> 42:28.660
- There's blood on your back.
- What?

42:28.729 --> 42:31.163
Blood! There's blood on your back.

42:33.233 --> 42:35.167
It went under there.
Help me move this thing.

42:35.235 --> 42:37.100
- What was it?
- I don't know what it was.

42:37.170 --> 42:40.833
- You sure you didn't put that on me?
- I didn't put anything on you.

42:42.743 --> 42:44.210
What is that?

42:44.511 --> 42:46.376
It could be dangerous!

42:48.315 --> 42:50.977
- It went down the grid.
- What the hell was that?

42:51.051 --> 42:55.078
I don't know!
Must have come out of this thing here.

42:55.756 --> 42:57.849
Some kind of petrified egg.

42:59.659 --> 43:01.991
- Where'd this come from?
- The closet.

43:02.929 --> 43:06.387
I remember seeing it fall
out of the box in the closet.

43:19.346 --> 43:20.813
The manifest.

43:21.314 --> 43:23.077
Box B-28.

43:23.150 --> 43:25.084
28? Okay, here we go.

43:25.152 --> 43:28.553
25, 26, 27, B-28.

43:29.422 --> 43:30.616
Oh, no.

43:34.761 --> 43:36.126
What is it?

43:38.498 --> 43:39.965
Space herpe.

43:41.001 --> 43:42.195
Herpe?

43:42.969 --> 43:44.436
Dormant form.

43:45.772 --> 43:49.139
"Keep away from heat and moisture.

43:49.976 --> 43:52.467
"Extremely dangerous when activated.

43:52.979 --> 43:54.742
"Antibody..."

43:55.549 --> 43:56.777
Oh, boy.

43:57.350 --> 43:58.681
"... unknown."

43:58.819 --> 44:00.650
- Oh, great.
- Put that down.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.347
Get rid of it!

44:02.989 --> 44:05.890
Hey, you guys,
Her Ladyship wants to see us.

44:06.092 --> 44:08.424
She's decided to give us
a third of all the water...

44:08.495 --> 44:10.224
if we help her in Zagora.

44:10.931 --> 44:12.694
Did you see anything out there?

44:12.766 --> 44:15.963
No. Why? What happened?

44:18.972 --> 44:21.566
The ship just got herpes.

44:28.815 --> 44:30.305
Give it to me!

44:34.621 --> 44:36.452
No! It's mine!

44:38.558 --> 44:40.116
Out of my water!

44:46.666 --> 44:49.100
There'll be no more spit with the shine...

44:49.169 --> 44:52.002
unless we get a ship
with some water in it.

44:53.940 --> 44:55.339
This way.

45:14.527 --> 45:16.518
Get out of my way!

45:16.596 --> 45:17.858
Come on!

45:20.700 --> 45:22.827
Better not mention that you're a princess.

45:22.903 --> 45:24.666
I think you're right.

45:24.905 --> 45:29.433
Jason, you never keep
any of your promises.

45:29.509 --> 45:32.444
- I don't? I will next time. I promise.
- You will?

45:32.512 --> 45:34.639
- Promise?
- Loosest women in the Galaxy.

45:34.714 --> 45:37.774
Just my size, spaceman.
How about a good time?

45:37.851 --> 45:39.079
Inside.

46:05.745 --> 46:07.235
It'll be coming up in a minute.

46:07.314 --> 46:09.179
Don't be a space age.

46:14.187 --> 46:17.088
So, did you get away
with everything intact?

46:18.358 --> 46:20.383
Yeah. I had a little help.

46:21.428 --> 46:23.953
- Tell you all about it...
- Hey, Jason.

46:25.865 --> 46:27.355
Your Highness.

46:27.434 --> 46:29.595
- Roscoe!
- How are you...

46:30.136 --> 46:32.798
- Shit.
- I'm sorry, Zeno. I forgot, man.

46:37.143 --> 46:38.474
Works perfectly.

46:38.545 --> 46:41.036
- Still the same old Zeno.
- Killjoy.

46:46.219 --> 46:48.084
Not a slow one in the batch.

46:48.154 --> 46:51.317
They're fresh from the lower sector
this morning.

46:58.098 --> 47:00.498
It's the cute one and the nigger.

47:03.003 --> 47:04.630
I meant the black gentleman.

47:04.704 --> 47:06.296
Black gentleman.

47:07.140 --> 47:11.076
- So, what happened to the Eagle?
- We lost the starboard section.

47:11.144 --> 47:15.410
- The whole section?
- Meteorite. The directionals went out.

47:15.482 --> 47:20.010
Yeah, and we just heard from Beak.
They've put a bounty out on your heads.

47:20.520 --> 47:21.919
$2 million.

47:22.155 --> 47:24.715
$2 million, I might turn myself in.

47:24.791 --> 47:27.191
That's it. I'm going to Zap's.

47:27.260 --> 47:28.955
- Do you want to go?
- Later.

47:29.029 --> 47:31.759
- You got any water?
- Is the sun bright?

47:31.831 --> 47:33.799
They're playing my song.

47:34.034 --> 47:35.934
Would you like to come?

47:36.369 --> 47:38.200
Zeno, have you seen Lanky Nibs?

47:38.271 --> 47:41.331
He disappeared.
Somebody said he got sick or something.

47:41.941 --> 47:43.636
He's up at Sweetwater.

47:43.710 --> 47:45.177
What's he doing in Sweetwater?

47:45.245 --> 47:46.610
Hiding out.

47:47.113 --> 47:48.273
From what?

47:48.381 --> 47:49.871
No one knows.

47:49.949 --> 47:52.417
Jason! They told me you were dead.

47:52.485 --> 47:54.953
Come on over here and give me a hug.

47:55.021 --> 47:58.115
- I knew they wouldn't get you.
- So, what have you got today?

47:58.191 --> 48:01.024
We have a special.
Solar steamers and live fondue.

48:01.561 --> 48:03.893
You always have solar steamers.

48:04.330 --> 48:07.128
- What would you like?
- Nothing, thank you.

48:07.333 --> 48:11.531
- Just bring a couple of drinks.
- If you want anything else, just ask me.

48:11.604 --> 48:14.334
- You're very beautiful.
- Thank you.

48:17.710 --> 48:19.234
He's not here.

48:19.312 --> 48:21.678
- Where's Sweetwater?
- About 50 miles outside of town.

48:21.748 --> 48:22.840
Can we go?

48:22.916 --> 48:25.077
- We'd need a land craft for that.
- And?

48:25.151 --> 48:28.177
And the only person I know
who's got a land craft...

48:28.254 --> 48:31.087
- is that guy sitting right over there.
- Thank you.

48:32.959 --> 48:34.449
That's a guy?

48:35.161 --> 48:39.325
He works for the city,
so we can't bribe him with water...

48:40.133 --> 48:42.931
but maybe if you were real nice to him...

48:43.670 --> 48:46.571
he'd do us a favor,
if you know what I mean.

48:46.673 --> 48:48.106
Not a chance.

48:48.308 --> 48:50.299
Then I guess we don't go.

48:50.977 --> 48:52.672
You're a bastard.

48:53.213 --> 48:55.010
I've been told that.

49:01.955 --> 49:05.482
Have you any suggestions
as to how I should handle this?

49:06.025 --> 49:07.925
Just have a lot of fun.

49:09.696 --> 49:10.890
Thanks.

49:16.236 --> 49:18.101
That wasn't very nice.

49:18.171 --> 49:20.435
Believe me, she had it coming.

49:26.346 --> 49:28.837
She seems to know what she's doing.

49:44.564 --> 49:45.588
So?

49:46.900 --> 49:50.768
Your he is a she,
and she thinks you're wonderful.

49:51.137 --> 49:52.399
She does?

49:55.375 --> 49:58.936
I think you better go over there
and see what you can do, Jason.

50:00.647 --> 50:01.841
No way.

50:01.915 --> 50:03.439
No water, then.

50:04.083 --> 50:05.550
You wouldn't.

50:06.319 --> 50:07.513
Try me.

50:09.355 --> 50:12.916
You still haven't told me
why you need to see Lanky Nibs.

50:14.694 --> 50:16.821
He knows where my father is.

50:22.035 --> 50:24.128
I'm going to remember this.

50:26.573 --> 50:28.234
I'm sure you will.

50:32.845 --> 50:34.039
Want me to go with you?

50:34.113 --> 50:36.946
No, I think he'd do much better
on his own.

50:56.336 --> 50:58.395
You're a mighty fine-looking woman, ma'am.

50:58.471 --> 51:01.599
I'd consider it an honor
if you did this dance with me.

51:01.674 --> 51:03.164
No, thank you.

51:04.244 --> 51:07.736
I'm afraid you don't understand, ma'am.
I'm insisting.

51:07.814 --> 51:09.441
The lady said no.

51:09.515 --> 51:11.107
Get lost, bitch!

51:12.385 --> 51:13.613
Dogbite.

51:14.988 --> 51:16.615
Did you see that?

51:24.697 --> 51:25.925
Sic her.

51:57.563 --> 51:59.087
Feeling better?

52:05.305 --> 52:07.671
Call the dog off. That's my dog.

52:12.378 --> 52:15.211
I think you owe the lady and me
an apology.

52:21.154 --> 52:22.621
My apologies.

52:28.861 --> 52:31.352
You didn't sound too sincere to me.

52:33.366 --> 52:34.424
I'm sorry.

52:34.767 --> 52:36.962
Don't believe him. He's lying.

53:06.899 --> 53:09.129
Do you mind
if I ask you something personal?

53:09.202 --> 53:10.396
No.

53:12.205 --> 53:14.070
Do you like my blouse?

53:14.674 --> 53:18.633
Do you like the color?
I mean, do you think it suits me?

53:18.778 --> 53:20.370
I'm being silly.

53:20.546 --> 53:22.639
No, you're not being silly.

53:22.982 --> 53:25.109
I think it's very flattering.

53:25.184 --> 53:27.812
It's exactly the kind of thing
that drives men crazy.

53:27.887 --> 53:29.855
Wouldn't you say, Jason?

53:31.124 --> 53:35.220
It's very nice.
Green is definitely your color.

53:36.062 --> 53:38.189
Thank you.

53:42.034 --> 53:45.299
Hands on the wheel, darling.
Plenty of time for that later.

54:07.427 --> 54:09.418
Why don't you wait here?

54:10.062 --> 54:11.461
Be careful.

54:12.999 --> 54:15.559
Don't worry.
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

55:18.831 --> 55:19.991
Lanky?

55:20.533 --> 55:23.502
Missed it.
The buggers are stealing me blind.

55:24.737 --> 55:26.864
Lanky, what happened to you?

55:27.073 --> 55:29.371
You shouldn't have come, Jason.

55:29.842 --> 55:31.935
What are you talking about?

55:32.011 --> 55:35.378
She knows.
They followed you, don't you know that?

55:36.148 --> 55:39.208
Nobody followed.
What the hell happened to you?

55:40.653 --> 55:42.280
You mean the bod?

55:42.622 --> 55:44.112
Yeah, the bod.

55:44.991 --> 55:46.322
Time warp.

55:47.026 --> 55:49.153
Lost 20 years in 20 seconds.

55:52.164 --> 55:54.496
You're looking for your father?

55:54.667 --> 55:55.725
Yes.

55:56.602 --> 55:58.365
You have his manner.

56:02.208 --> 56:04.733
Son of a bitch, missed them again.

56:04.810 --> 56:08.610
- Those nippers have hard heads.
- What do you know about my father?

56:08.681 --> 56:11.673
He's a good man, fine spacer.

56:13.352 --> 56:15.912
He captured me
in the midsection three months ago.

56:15.988 --> 56:17.478
What happened?

56:17.990 --> 56:21.187
He told me the wars were coming to an end.

56:22.161 --> 56:24.857
The Galaxy was getting a second chance.

56:25.731 --> 56:28.495
His entire crew were changed beings.

56:29.268 --> 56:32.362
I've never seen such joy
and hope amongst men.

56:33.406 --> 56:35.169
Just from seeing it.

56:35.975 --> 56:37.374
Seeing what?

56:37.910 --> 56:39.605
The seventh world.

56:40.212 --> 56:44.012
They found a way through to the center
in the seventh world.

56:44.150 --> 56:47.847
- And you believed them?
- I saw the tapes, tasted the water.

56:49.822 --> 56:51.619
It's there, Jason.

56:52.858 --> 56:55.292
Just like they always said it was.

56:56.862 --> 56:59.057
But what happened after that?

56:59.465 --> 57:01.990
We flew to a base in the Tri System.

57:03.603 --> 57:05.696
They were there, waiting for us.

57:05.771 --> 57:07.796
- Who?
- Templars.

57:09.408 --> 57:12.844
After your father left the ship,
they came on board...

57:13.045 --> 57:15.309
and massacred the entire crew.

57:15.381 --> 57:16.643
For what?

57:17.016 --> 57:19.143
Power, control.

57:19.385 --> 57:24.015
A planet of water like the seventh world
would destroy their control of the Galaxy.

57:24.090 --> 57:26.183
Then my father is still alive.

57:26.258 --> 57:29.750
It's possible. If he is, he's being held
in the Tri System by Wendon.

57:31.464 --> 57:33.125
How'd you get away?

57:33.199 --> 57:36.828
Played dead.
After they left, I stole the ship.

57:39.138 --> 57:41.936
- I always knew they'd find me.
- Who is it?

57:44.110 --> 57:47.341
- I don't know.
- We're the only ones left who know.

57:50.116 --> 57:51.913
They have to kill us.

57:52.018 --> 57:54.350
Let's get out of here. Come on.

57:54.820 --> 57:56.344
Come on, let's go!

57:56.422 --> 57:57.912
Save yourself.

57:58.424 --> 58:00.619
I'm tired of running, fighting.

58:01.327 --> 58:03.318
What's the matter with you?
Come on, let's go!

58:03.396 --> 58:04.761
What the hell are you doing?

58:04.830 --> 58:07.094
Saving you, you crotchety old fart.

58:07.166 --> 58:09.066
I can still walk on my own.

58:10.036 --> 58:11.230
Come on.

58:18.911 --> 58:20.173
Look out!

58:26.819 --> 58:28.787
Bounty hunters. Come on.

58:36.128 --> 58:37.288
The woman!

58:37.363 --> 58:40.628
- Let's get on them!
- Stop. Please, stop.

58:41.500 --> 58:42.728
Faster!

59:00.519 --> 59:01.543
All right!

59:01.620 --> 59:04.453
- Just like old times.
- Remember the time when we...

59:04.523 --> 59:06.286
They're coming back!

59:11.897 --> 59:14.695
Come on, guys. Faster!

59:26.779 --> 59:28.906
Just get it started! Go, go, go!

59:39.225 --> 59:41.125
Faster!

59:43.395 --> 59:45.556
Forward!

59:51.003 --> 59:53.130
Kill him, Cahones, kill him!

01:00:15.094 --> 01:00:16.755
Kill him, Cahones!

01:00:18.931 --> 01:00:21.024
Kill him! Cahones?

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.035
What...

01:00:35.581 --> 01:00:37.208
I'm not the boss.

01:00:42.488 --> 01:00:44.752
Good luck, and don't forget to write!

01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:05.140
Never thought I'd be dying
before you, Jason.

01:01:05.845 --> 01:01:08.370
You're not dying,
so stop talking about it.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.380
You always were the optimist.

01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:13.009
That's right.
We're getting you out of here.

01:01:14.386 --> 01:01:16.718
It's his back. It's broken.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.054
I'll miss all you beautiful women...

01:01:24.697 --> 01:01:26.096
most of all.

01:01:31.837 --> 01:01:33.702
What can I do?

01:01:33.973 --> 01:01:35.201
Find it.

01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:38.534
It's there, Jason.

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:40.238
Her father knows.

01:01:40.312 --> 01:01:42.109
Go to the Tri System.

01:01:55.027 --> 01:01:56.654
I'm sorry, Jason.

01:02:20.886 --> 01:02:23.480
There never was
and never will be a seventh world.

01:02:23.555 --> 01:02:24.920
But you're still coming, right?

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:27.550
Will somebody explain to me
just what a seventh world is?

01:02:27.626 --> 01:02:28.888
Didn't they teach you nothing?

01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:32.328
Just the basics, like how to
stomp on little people like you.

01:02:32.965 --> 01:02:35.559
The six water planets
were destroyed in the galactic war.

01:02:35.634 --> 01:02:38.831
Some people believe a seventh planet
spun out of orbit and survived.

01:02:38.904 --> 01:02:41.805
- Yeah? Where?
- No one knows, except the lady's father.

01:02:41.874 --> 01:02:45.275
If there was one, it would have
been discovered in the last 10,000 years.

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:48.711
Not if it's in the center of the Galaxy.
It's impossible to go there.

01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:51.181
- It's not impossible.
- What do you know?

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.548
You haven't experienced
the time warp at the center.

01:02:53.619 --> 01:02:54.677
I don't want to, either.

01:02:54.753 --> 01:02:57.517
I've seen ships where healthy men
and even young children...

01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:59.819
came back aged and senile.

01:03:00.259 --> 01:03:03.695
It's past the Princess's tea time, Percy.
Rattle your rivets.

01:03:03.762 --> 01:03:05.627
- Yes, ma 'am.
- You, on the watch bridge...

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:09.395
put those things over there.
The rest of you guys, keep going.

01:03:09.468 --> 01:03:11.095
Are we in trouble.

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:14.162
- This the best you could do?
- That's all they had in the town.

01:03:14.239 --> 01:03:15.570
- These cost $5,000.
- $5,000?

01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:17.370
I told you robots were a good business.

01:03:17.443 --> 01:03:20.503
Cleared for blastoff.
Two minutes and counting.

01:03:21.013 --> 01:03:22.708
Take your time, guys.

01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:24.681
Isn't that Headless?

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.184
Yeah. He was sold as scrap.

01:03:27.252 --> 01:03:30.517
I haven't quite figured out
his program yet, but he's doing okay.

01:03:31.323 --> 01:03:34.121
- Yeah, he looks real good.
- Prepare for blastoff.

01:03:34.193 --> 01:03:37.890
- I don't know what we'd do without you.
- All right, keep coming.

01:03:37.963 --> 01:03:40.727
Second on the left,
and save your batteries.

01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:43.267
...eight, seven...

01:03:43.335 --> 01:03:45.200
What do you know about this Tri System?

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:47.670
- Remember Lord Axton's son?
- Weird Wendon?

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.870
Yeah. They got fed up with his antics,
so they set him up with his own planet.

01:03:51.944 --> 01:03:54.003
What exactly are we going there for?

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:57.310
It's the last place
Lanky saw the Princess's father alive.

01:04:16.668 --> 01:04:20.434
Would you keep stirring that, darling?
Let me take a look here at this recipe.

01:04:20.506 --> 01:04:22.701
"Half a teaspoon of carrots."

01:04:23.275 --> 01:04:25.505
These are big eaters. May as well...

01:04:26.678 --> 01:04:28.976
put a few of these things in here.

01:04:30.682 --> 01:04:32.582
Yeah! Nice hit, nice hit!

01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:36.485
- You ever think about playing this game?
- No, too rowdy for me.

01:04:36.555 --> 01:04:38.887
Yeah, know what you mean. Me, too.

01:04:38.957 --> 01:04:41.118
- That's barbaric!
- Yeah.

01:04:42.227 --> 01:04:44.627
- Man!
- Have you ever been to a Club Red?

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:48.958
Yes.

01:04:51.837 --> 01:04:52.895
And?

01:04:53.405 --> 01:04:55.930
It wasn't as good as they advertised.

01:04:57.076 --> 01:04:58.737
How disappointing.

01:04:59.378 --> 01:05:00.436
That's what I thought.

01:05:00.512 --> 01:05:03.174
It says here that the water planet
has so much moisture...

01:05:03.248 --> 01:05:07.776
on its surface that it continuously
creates cycles of clouds...

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.081
and falling rain.

01:05:10.155 --> 01:05:12.055
- Sure.
- You know what that means.

01:05:12.124 --> 01:05:15.491
We'll both be able to take
hot, wet baths together.

01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:18.354
Watch your backs now.
Hot stuff coming through.

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.591
You wanna move those dishes, honey?

01:05:22.734 --> 01:05:23.894
Bravo.

01:05:26.538 --> 01:05:28.165
I call her Myron.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.004
Nothing but the finest herbs,
my dead mother's stuffing...

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:33.476
and fresh garlic from a real garden.

01:05:33.545 --> 01:05:36.070
Okay, now note the juice...

01:05:36.148 --> 01:05:38.776
which flows from the initial incision.

01:05:44.556 --> 01:05:45.784
Kill it!

01:05:46.925 --> 01:05:48.017
Dead!

01:05:49.628 --> 01:05:51.061
My circuits!

01:05:56.168 --> 01:05:58.728
- Where'd it go?
- Heating duct, damn it.

01:05:58.804 --> 01:06:00.294
What was that?

01:06:01.206 --> 01:06:03.333
It was a space herpe.

01:06:03.642 --> 01:06:04.836
A what?

01:06:07.179 --> 01:06:08.578
Space herpe.

01:06:08.847 --> 01:06:11.077
That's disgusting!

01:06:11.483 --> 01:06:13.974
How long have you known about this?

01:06:14.686 --> 01:06:18.087
- It's the first we've heard of it.
- A couple of days.

01:06:18.223 --> 01:06:21.056
- A couple of days.
- It's the first we've heard of it.

01:06:21.126 --> 01:06:24.459
And you didn't tell us about it?
That's unforgivable!

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.395
How could you do a thing like that?

01:06:26.465 --> 01:06:29.400
I want the entire ship searched
before we reach the Tri System.

01:06:29.468 --> 01:06:30.730
Yes, sir.

01:06:37.776 --> 01:06:40.074
It's really not that dangerous.

01:06:41.079 --> 01:06:43.377
That's not what I've been told.

01:06:56.094 --> 01:06:58.961
Range 257. Closing 850.

01:07:00.465 --> 01:07:01.796
Bearing correct.

01:07:01.867 --> 01:07:04.097
It smells like rotten eggs down here.

01:07:04.169 --> 01:07:07.866
We've got a 1.7 O level.
You should be feeling fine.

01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:11.401
You are moving out of visual contact.

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.555
Look out!

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:27.712
Welcome to the playroom.

01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:30.038
I was wondering if you'd ever come.

01:09:30.115 --> 01:09:33.050
- Your father has given up hope.
- Where is he?

01:09:33.385 --> 01:09:36.946
Probably moping.
I'm afraid he's lost his sense of humor.

01:09:37.356 --> 01:09:40.883
He no longer realizes
that all of life is but a game.

01:09:41.225 --> 01:09:42.886
What have you done to him?

01:09:42.961 --> 01:09:45.953
I've coddled him
as if he were my own child.

01:09:46.198 --> 01:09:49.564
After all, he's responsible
for all of this.

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:52.461
I want to see him.

01:09:52.537 --> 01:09:54.528
No! You'll make him sick.

01:09:55.273 --> 01:09:58.333
And if he dies,
they'll stop taking care of me.

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:01.102
You give us her father...

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.574
and we'll take you
to the seventh world with us.

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.375
There'll be room for everyone.

01:10:07.452 --> 01:10:09.920
What for? We have everything here.

01:10:10.622 --> 01:10:13.682
- But you still live in fear.
- It's stimulating.

01:10:13.859 --> 01:10:17.795
Besides, I couldn't exist
without servants. Liquid.

01:10:22.601 --> 01:10:26.970
You see, I exist exactly the same way
the system exists.

01:10:27.339 --> 01:10:29.102
I survive because...

01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:33.337
people without water will do anything.

01:10:33.612 --> 01:10:35.375
Let me demonstrate.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.506
Zagar, you can kill him now.

01:10:57.903 --> 01:10:59.461
Stop or I'll kill him!

01:10:59.538 --> 01:11:01.062
Do as she says!

01:11:03.074 --> 01:11:04.405
I mean it.

01:11:12.684 --> 01:11:14.242
You need some help?

01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:16.719
Got them right where I want them.

01:11:16.888 --> 01:11:17.912
I know the feeling.

01:11:17.989 --> 01:11:22.187
- All right, girls, let that be a lesson to you.
- I have a splitting headache.

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.194
Would you happen to have a Tylenol?

01:11:24.262 --> 01:11:27.527
You'll need more than Tylenol
if you don't tell me where my father is.

01:11:27.599 --> 01:11:29.191
I can't do that.

01:11:30.469 --> 01:11:32.869
We'll see about that,
you fat-faced little freak.

01:11:32.938 --> 01:11:34.166
You want me to make you?

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:37.299
What are you gonna do,
pull out my fingernails?

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:39.203
Chop off my head?

01:11:41.847 --> 01:11:42.871
No.

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:07.035
He's in the Oval Room!

01:12:09.608 --> 01:12:11.132
Big, macho guy.

01:12:19.017 --> 01:12:20.746
Stand back, ladies.

01:12:21.019 --> 01:12:22.816
Do as he says, girls.

01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:34.258
Daddy?

01:12:50.882 --> 01:12:52.679
You're not my father.

01:12:52.784 --> 01:12:54.581
That's not my father.

01:12:57.889 --> 01:12:59.720
That's not my father.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.423
It's an Omega robot.

01:13:08.433 --> 01:13:09.991
We'll find him.

01:13:10.402 --> 01:13:11.960
Don't worry, we'll find him.

01:13:12.037 --> 01:13:15.632
How touching.
It always gets me when people cry.

01:13:28.587 --> 01:13:31.784
How could I have thought
that thing was my father?

01:13:32.257 --> 01:13:34.782
It's just a straightforward program.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.895
Nothing to indicate
he was forced to make it.

01:13:38.363 --> 01:13:40.388
There must be something...

01:13:40.599 --> 01:13:43.295
some kind of message in the memory bank?

01:13:45.403 --> 01:13:47.530
Zeno, sync to coordinate 10.

01:13:47.706 --> 01:13:50.675
That's the only non sequitur
in the whole program.

01:13:50.742 --> 01:13:53.176
- What is it?
- Some kind of circle.

01:13:53.645 --> 01:13:55.044
It's a ring.

01:13:57.282 --> 01:13:59.113
Where's my father's ring?

01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:01.015
Ring? What ring?

01:14:01.353 --> 01:14:03.082
He must have given it to you.

01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:05.384
You mean I have value again?

01:14:05.457 --> 01:14:08.483
How would you like me to drop-kick you
into the next time zone?

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.688
You're so physical.
It really isn't necessary.

01:14:17.636 --> 01:14:19.900
It was a gift. He gave it to me!

01:14:19.971 --> 01:14:22.371
- What else have you got in there?
- Nothing.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.840
Would you care to make a deposit?

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:33.783
Please work.

01:14:51.136 --> 01:14:53.536
They tell me that you are dead...

01:14:54.406 --> 01:14:56.374
that there is no hope...

01:14:56.508 --> 01:14:58.408
just our own salvation.

01:14:59.444 --> 01:15:02.675
It all seems purposeless without you.

01:15:03.048 --> 01:15:05.039
But these are good people...

01:15:05.116 --> 01:15:07.949
so I shall take them to the seventh world.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.448
The Omega will save Wendon
in case you still survive.

01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:18.195
My coordinates are 283
on the Iona projection.

01:15:19.798 --> 01:15:21.925
No deviation is permissible.

01:15:22.367 --> 01:15:23.766
If you do...

01:15:24.536 --> 01:15:27.369
you will be suspended in time forever.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.569
I love you, Karina.

01:15:30.842 --> 01:15:34.642
I can only dream
and pretend that you still exist.

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:37.847
God save us.

01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:49.459
At least we know he's still alive.

01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:53.898
We're going to find him.

01:15:59.637 --> 01:16:01.662
Set course for the meridian.

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:03.401
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:05.875
- Keep a close lookout.
- What about me?

01:16:05.944 --> 01:16:09.880
- What's gonna happen to me?
- Don't worry, Captain, I'll take care of him.

01:16:09.948 --> 01:16:11.472
I always wanted to get ahead.

01:16:11.549 --> 01:16:14.848
Don't drop me, you palooka!
I just got my nose done!

01:16:15.987 --> 01:16:17.750
So what do you think?

01:16:17.822 --> 01:16:19.983
I'm beginning to believe it.

01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:24.992
- What's that?
- Beauford.

01:16:26.431 --> 01:16:28.865
- Beauford?
- Beauford. Yeah.

01:16:30.368 --> 01:16:32.097
I just rebuilt him.

01:16:34.839 --> 01:16:36.238
Looks good.

01:16:36.641 --> 01:16:39.576
His motor system
is. 01 milliseconds faster...

01:16:39.644 --> 01:16:41.475
than the finest Omega built.

01:16:43.615 --> 01:16:45.412
I don't mean anything by this...

01:16:45.483 --> 01:16:48.179
but is there any particular reason
why he's black?

01:16:48.253 --> 01:16:50.778
Sure. I wanted him to be perfect.

01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:12.509
Hi, guys.

01:17:19.217 --> 01:17:23.313
That's good. Yeah, a little harder.

01:17:24.255 --> 01:17:26.382
That's perfect. Don't stop.

01:17:28.026 --> 01:17:30.790
Yeah, a little... Don't stop.

01:17:32.831 --> 01:17:34.924
- Who is it?
- Me, Jason.

01:17:46.511 --> 01:17:48.979
I just came by
to see how you were feeling.

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:50.981
Much better, thank you.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.185
I brought the tape
I was telling you about.

01:17:56.154 --> 01:17:57.314
Great.

01:17:58.223 --> 01:18:00.214
Thank you, Percy. That was wonderful.

01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:02.020
My pleasure, ma 'am.

01:18:06.698 --> 01:18:08.290
Talented fellow.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.891
I think I overworked him.

01:18:11.502 --> 01:18:14.096
That's a lot of body to rub.

01:18:15.673 --> 01:18:17.402
How would you know?

01:18:18.309 --> 01:18:21.767
I've been observing it
for the past 4 billion miles.

01:18:27.785 --> 01:18:29.412
What's it called?

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:33.457
The tape.

01:18:34.659 --> 01:18:36.251
Passion Storm.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.737
Did you just do that?

01:18:51.976 --> 01:18:53.443
Force fields.

01:18:56.814 --> 01:18:58.475
You had me worried.

01:18:58.549 --> 01:19:00.141
Don't worry.

01:19:00.952 --> 01:19:03.580
You're in the hands of a professional.

01:19:08.293 --> 01:19:10.318
Slip it in there, darling.

01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:17.030
Hello, your environmental chamber
is ready.

01:19:17.769 --> 01:19:21.000
The program: Passion Storm.

01:19:21.506 --> 01:19:24.373
All rights to this material are reserved.

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:27.437
Enjoy yourselves.

01:20:03.982 --> 01:20:06.473
I think I should take my saber off.

01:20:08.286 --> 01:20:09.480
Let me.

01:20:14.359 --> 01:20:16.020
It feels so stiff.

01:20:16.995 --> 01:20:18.622
The belt, I mean.

01:20:53.064 --> 01:20:55.532
Shouldn't you be at the controls?

01:20:57.702 --> 01:20:59.192
If you insist.

01:21:23.027 --> 01:21:25.655
- What's going on?
- I don't know, I just got here myself.

01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:28.062
Percy, let's see what's happening.

01:21:28.132 --> 01:21:29.793
Maida, what's going on?

01:21:29.867 --> 01:21:31.858
We've got an unidentified ship
on our tail.

01:21:31.936 --> 01:21:32.925
I don't believe it.

01:21:33.004 --> 01:21:35.666
It's moving five times faster
than anything I've seen.

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:38.368
- What's the configuration?
- Battleship. Came from nowhere.

01:21:38.443 --> 01:21:40.673
Visual scan coming through.

01:21:42.246 --> 01:21:43.270
She's a Templar.

01:21:43.347 --> 01:21:45.713
Impossible.
They don't have anything that fast.

01:21:45.783 --> 01:21:48.251
We're entering the time warp.
Everything's speeding up.

01:21:48.319 --> 01:21:50.685
Starfield's closing
at a multiple of seven.

01:21:50.755 --> 01:21:53.519
Hope you don't mind,
but I have no intention of facing this.

01:21:53.591 --> 01:21:55.388
We're already at maximum power.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:58.623
- She's closing fast.
- We can't change course. It's too late.

01:21:58.696 --> 01:22:02.996
- We'll be lost in the warp forever.
- We can't fight them if we don't maneuver.

01:22:03.067 --> 01:22:04.796
She's coming right at us.

01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:08.638
My congratulations, Karina.

01:22:09.107 --> 01:22:10.734
You have succeeded in doing...

01:22:10.808 --> 01:22:14.767
what the entire Galactic Command
failed to accomplish.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.142
You've led us to the seventh world.

01:22:18.349 --> 01:22:21.045
It's a pity you chose, like your father...

01:22:21.119 --> 01:22:23.144
to work against the order.

01:22:23.855 --> 01:22:26.255
He planned this from the very beginning.

01:22:27.325 --> 01:22:29.759
Kill the B system.
Check the laser shields.

01:22:29.827 --> 01:22:31.226
We just lost the first bank.

01:22:31.295 --> 01:22:33.661
Accelerating at a multiple of 48
and increasing.

01:22:33.731 --> 01:22:36.199
That's a day gone by every half-hour.

01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:38.360
Multiple of 64, still increasing.

01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:40.836
They're gonna try to board us.
Get the robots.

01:22:40.905 --> 01:22:44.033
Does Wendon have a body yet? Get him.
We need every available hand.

01:22:44.108 --> 01:22:46.804
Check the upper decks.
Zeno, we get the hold.

01:22:46.878 --> 01:22:48.778
It's all yours, ladies. Keep it on course.

01:22:48.846 --> 01:22:51.144
And remember, we're all getting older.

01:23:01.159 --> 01:23:02.217
They're on to us.

01:23:02.293 --> 01:23:05.194
Check below. I'll take the corridor.
Robots, wait here.

01:23:21.279 --> 01:23:23.509
- Get the robots down here!
- Look out!

01:23:25.716 --> 01:23:26.978
Go in there! Get them!

01:23:27.051 --> 01:23:28.951
You're up, partner! Go!

01:23:30.121 --> 01:23:31.588
Get some more help!

01:23:31.656 --> 01:23:33.521
Take the control room.

01:23:35.092 --> 01:23:37.492
- How's it going?
- It's going great.

01:23:37.562 --> 01:23:39.257
How's it going with you?

01:23:40.531 --> 01:23:41.691
What a mess!

01:23:43.968 --> 01:23:47.301
Ten thousand.
More than a day every second.

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:49.038
Surprise, surprise!

01:23:49.106 --> 01:23:51.939
They decided to treat me
like a human again.

01:23:52.009 --> 01:23:53.033
What do you think?

01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:55.704
I think you talk too much,
that's what I think.

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.216
- What is it?
- I think I'd better go to my room.

01:24:01.185 --> 01:24:02.447
I feel sick.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.045
Her Maj does look a bit peaky,
doesn't she?

01:24:05.122 --> 01:24:07.022
We're all three months older.

01:24:08.092 --> 01:24:11.357
They're all worn out, Jason.
We got to get some more parts.

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:16.929
This one still has a good power system!

01:24:17.001 --> 01:24:19.799
Damn it, there's no way
we're going to stop them!

01:24:24.442 --> 01:24:27.206
Get in there! Go on! Go, go!

01:24:29.046 --> 01:24:30.274
Oh, God.

01:24:30.948 --> 01:24:34.349
Get in there! Be careful.
Watch out, don't...

01:24:34.719 --> 01:24:36.084
Don't slip.

01:24:38.756 --> 01:24:40.018
Okay, here's another seven!

01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:42.457
- Where's the rest of them?
- They're being activated.

01:24:42.526 --> 01:24:45.154
- Get them in there! Come on, let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:47.288
Take your weapon! Hey, wait.

01:24:48.466 --> 01:24:50.832
- This is a mess, isn't it?
- What are you doing here?

01:24:50.901 --> 01:24:52.664
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

01:24:52.737 --> 01:24:54.705
Well, maybe it's not that bad.

01:24:54.772 --> 01:24:57.138
The Princess is pregnant.

01:24:57.208 --> 01:24:59.335
Pregnant? How in the hell did that happen?

01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:01.344
You can be sure I had nothing
to do with it.

01:25:01.412 --> 01:25:03.573
She's asking to see you.

01:25:05.516 --> 01:25:06.608
I'll be back in a minute.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:09.380
A minute's a very long time
under the circumstances!

01:25:20.965 --> 01:25:23.365
Well done, Percy. You got him!

01:25:24.235 --> 01:25:27.568
- Is everything okay?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

01:25:34.745 --> 01:25:37.213
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?

01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:41.078
Big surprise, Daddy.

01:25:43.487 --> 01:25:44.647
Daddy?

01:25:44.855 --> 01:25:46.447
Congratulations.

01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.287
That's not mine.

01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:55.960
Chin up.

01:25:58.235 --> 01:25:59.862
No, that's not...

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.071
It's mine.

01:26:04.141 --> 01:26:07.076
- Definitely yours.
- Would you like to hold him?

01:26:07.144 --> 01:26:10.671
No, I've got some other problems
I have to take care of.

01:26:13.284 --> 01:26:14.911
Sorry about that.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:45.239
What the hell is going on?

01:26:48.419 --> 01:26:51.513
Go back to the ice hold.
We'll stop them there!

01:27:10.274 --> 01:27:11.468
Charge!

01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:14.501
Jason, don't be disturbing Nanny.

01:27:14.578 --> 01:27:16.478
She's getting very old.

01:27:18.516 --> 01:27:19.676
Nanny?

01:27:25.623 --> 01:27:28.490
I don't know about you,
but I'm getting real tired.

01:27:28.559 --> 01:27:30.083
All right, now!

01:27:36.767 --> 01:27:38.997
Advance! Come on, let's go!

01:27:39.069 --> 01:27:40.400
Stop them!

01:27:41.038 --> 01:27:43.268
Now, Beauford! Now!

01:27:44.942 --> 01:27:46.739
Let's get out of here!

01:27:49.079 --> 01:27:51.070
Die!

01:27:51.148 --> 01:27:52.672
- Now!
- Let's go!

01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:01.921
Robots, attack!

01:28:01.992 --> 01:28:03.459
Are you all right?

01:28:03.527 --> 01:28:04.892
- I think.
- Good.

01:28:05.196 --> 01:28:07.494
I'm getting too old for this.

01:28:20.277 --> 01:28:22.302
All right! All right, yeah!

01:28:39.697 --> 01:28:42.257
I'd have cut him to pieces 10 minutes ago.

01:28:46.737 --> 01:28:47.965
Killjoy.

01:28:55.079 --> 01:28:57.445
Oh, no, not him again!

01:28:58.816 --> 01:29:00.443
You are finished.

01:29:01.051 --> 01:29:03.576
The seventh world is mine!

01:29:03.654 --> 01:29:07.886
- Come on, Roscoe, you're looking bad.
- You don't look too good yourself.

01:29:08.726 --> 01:29:10.284
They're gaining on us.

01:29:10.361 --> 01:29:12.124
I guess this is it.

01:29:12.196 --> 01:29:13.788
Here I come, Dad!

01:29:14.131 --> 01:29:15.723
Hit it, Roscoe!

01:29:19.737 --> 01:29:22.729
It's him!

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.632
That's our baby.

01:29:25.442 --> 01:29:28.741
- That is him.
- Isn't he beautiful?

01:29:28.812 --> 01:29:30.780
Mom, Dad, we won!

01:29:31.549 --> 01:29:33.779
He's a chip off the old block.

01:29:34.251 --> 01:29:36.719
I... always...

01:29:37.221 --> 01:29:39.348
hated... kids.

01:29:58.409 --> 01:30:00.172
We came through it.

01:30:00.711 --> 01:30:02.872
We're back to the exact moment
we were at...

01:30:02.947 --> 01:30:04.209
when we entered the time warp.

01:30:04.281 --> 01:30:07.682
- Velocity is back to normal.
- What happened to the other ship?

01:30:08.285 --> 01:30:11.812
It's gone. They were one degree
off the course when we entered the warp.

01:30:11.889 --> 01:30:14.449
Just one degree and they're lost forever?

01:30:14.525 --> 01:30:16.755
Will somebody please tell me...

01:30:16.827 --> 01:30:19.557
that what I think just happened
really didn't?

01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:21.723
It did.

01:30:21.932 --> 01:30:23.331
It happened.

01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:27.569
- We made it!
- All right!

01:30:28.172 --> 01:30:29.833
I knew we'd do it!

01:30:44.154 --> 01:30:45.883
I don't believe it.

01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:48.148
It's beautiful.

01:30:49.693 --> 01:30:52.184
