00:08.474 --> 00:10.142
You're not gonna tell me
what you did with
the Sith holocron, are you?

00:10.144 --> 00:13.112
I told you it was safe.

00:13.114 --> 00:16.115
But what if there are secrets
we can learn from it that'll
help us destroy the Sith?

00:16.117 --> 00:20.519
Ezra, the secrets
in that thing
almost destroyed you.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.122
I know. But if not
to get the Sith holocron,

00:23.124 --> 00:25.224
why did Master Yoda
send us to Malachor?

00:25.226 --> 00:28.527
We asked for a chance
to defeat the Sith,
and we failed.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.561
Coming up
on the rendezvous point,
Commander,

00:29.563 --> 00:31.930
but the transport's
not responding.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.070
It looks like
it was attacked.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.685
There must have been
one heck of a fight.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.921
KANAN: I can smell
the carbon scoring.

00:57.323 --> 00:58.891

01:09.335 --> 01:11.670
Hang on, all right?
We'll get you help.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.605
What happened here?

01:13.607 --> 01:16.041
Red... Red blade.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.577
After you...
Made me tell...

01:19.746 --> 01:21.880
The <i> Ghost</i> is in danger.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.782
(GROANS)
Another Inquisitor?

01:23.784 --> 01:25.184
We've gotta warn Hera.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.623
Got the <i> Ghost</i>
for you now, sir.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.693
Hera! Am I glad to see
you're all right.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.727
<i>Kanan.</i>

01:35.729 --> 01:37.729
There's another
Inquisitor after us.

01:37.731 --> 01:38.931
He knows
where the <i> Ghost</i> is.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.767
<i>Kanan, it's not</i>
<i>an Inquisitor.</i>

01:41.769 --> 01:44.136
Oh, no.
What? Who is it?

01:44.138 --> 01:49.308
<i>Just an old friend,</i>
<i>Master Jedi.</i>

01:53.246 --> 01:57.249
Maul? You betrayed me!

01:57.251 --> 01:59.051
<i>No, I betrayed</i>
<i>your friends.</i>

01:59.053 --> 02:02.754
<i>But I would have</i>

02:02.756 --> 02:04.089
What do you want?

02:06.260 --> 02:09.261

02:09.263 --> 02:11.797
We don't have it.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.666
<i>How unfortunate,</i>

02:16.769 --> 02:17.836

02:17.838 --> 02:21.907
Okay, we have it.
Just not with us.

02:21.909 --> 02:25.744
We'll give it to you,
as long as our friends
remain safe.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.779
<i>Agreed. Good. Oh,
and one more thing,</i>

02:27.781 --> 02:33.085
<i>your Jedi holocron,</i>
<i>give that to me as well.</i>

02:33.087 --> 02:34.753
<i>Kanan, no.</i>

02:35.021 --> 02:36.655
Fine.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.958
<i>I shall be in touch</i>

<i>for our rendezvous.</i>

02:39.960 --> 02:42.961
<i>Don't disappoint me.</i>

02:42.963 --> 02:45.664
I can't believe
you told Maul
I have a holocron.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.033
At the time,
he was on our side.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.635
Is it still on the <i> Ghost?</i>

02:49.637 --> 02:51.036
Where else
would I keep it?

02:52.205 --> 02:53.705
Well, what about
the Sith holocron?

02:53.707 --> 02:56.341
Yeah, that's not
gonna be easy.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.876
I thought you said
it was safe.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.346
It is safe.
That may be the problem.

03:02.982 --> 03:08.854
I assumed that this ship
was merely a transport,

03:08.856 --> 03:12.057
but I realize
it is much more than that.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.358
This is your home.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.194
You looking
to move in?

03:15.196 --> 03:19.231
Captain, would it be
rude of me to request
a tour of your ship?

03:19.233 --> 03:23.635
Well, the airlock
is down there, if you want
to see yourself out.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.705
Show me around.
I insist.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.142
No! (GROWLS)
Hera, don't.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.710
(ZEB GROWLS)

03:31.712 --> 03:36.748
Mandalorian, you of all
should trust me.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.751
For did I not once
rule your people?

03:44.724 --> 03:47.192
Is that true?
Unfortunately.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.896
Where does one
who hides his identity

03:50.898 --> 03:52.764
hide his legacy?

03:52.766 --> 03:56.902

That is a curious smell.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.773
How colorful.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.450
Ah, yes.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.184
This is it.

04:12.186 --> 04:15.854
A dull and dour chamber.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.924
These are the quarters
of a Jedi.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.227
Show me where
he keeps the holocron.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.128
I don't know anything
about him.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.797
That's not true.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.934
You know
all about Kanan Jarrus.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.738
Or should I use
his real name?

04:32.740 --> 04:35.307
Caleb Dume.

04:36.142 --> 04:36.942
(GRUNTS)

04:39.979 --> 04:45.884
Yes, it was your idea
to recruit the apprentice.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.955
And it was from here
that the boy found...

04:50.790 --> 04:55.060
No, he stole
the holocron.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.863
(LAUGHING)

05:00.800 --> 05:04.169
That wasn't so difficult,
was it?

05:08.274 --> 05:10.976
So, you hid the holocron
down there?

05:10.978 --> 05:13.979
More like I left it
with someone.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.981
Someone? Who?

05:25.191 --> 05:27.826
(DEVICE BEEPING)

05:27.828 --> 05:29.695
Bendu?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.930
Bendu, are you here?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.131
"Bendu"? Who's Bendu?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.901
There's nothing here.

05:36.636 --> 05:37.936
He was here.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.138
Maybe you're just
hearing things
that aren't there.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.007
Bendu! I need the holocron!

05:42.009 --> 05:43.942
Bendu!

05:43.944 --> 05:47.079
Mmm, Kanan,
I don't see your friend.

05:49.282 --> 05:53.018
(GASPS) Oh! Oh,
but I do see crawlers!

05:53.020 --> 05:56.688
Lots of 'em!
Hey, where's our thumper?

05:57.890 --> 06:00.992
If you stay calm,
they won't attack.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.227
Right.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.062
Stay behind me!

06:04.064 --> 06:06.565
Ezra, you're
making it worse!

06:06.567 --> 06:08.200
It's possible
to get along with them.

06:08.202 --> 06:11.870
Mmm, I tried that, remember?
They almost ripped
my face off.

06:17.076 --> 06:17.809
He's here.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.212
What?

(LOW GROANING)

06:41.567 --> 06:44.236

and with his student.

06:45.204 --> 06:49.741
Perhaps for a talk?
(LAUGHING)

06:49.743 --> 06:50.976
I don't believe it.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.047
Unfortunately,
we don't have time
to chat, Bendu.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.616
We've come
for the holocron.

06:57.618 --> 07:01.853
Ah, yes, the keeper
of the shadow lore.
Why do you want it?

07:02.889 --> 07:04.923
Tell him, Ezra.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.925
Uh... Okay.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.794
We need it
to save our friends.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.962
A Sith, Darth Maul,
has them.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.697
He wants it.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.866
I do not know
this darksider,

07:14.868 --> 07:16.468
but I know his kind.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.235
Why does he want it?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.937
I don't know.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.573
But he also wants
my Jedi holocron.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.743
Oh. He would
bring them together?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.145
Such a vergence
carries grave danger.

07:27.147 --> 07:31.149
Why? I thought the holocrons
were just libraries
of information.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.753
They are that and more.

07:34.755 --> 07:38.156
If two such powerful
sources of knowledge
are united,

07:38.158 --> 07:43.161
they will grant
a clarity of vision
beyond your kind.

07:43.163 --> 07:49.768
KANAN: What does that mean? When
joined, any secret, wisdom or destiny

07:49.770 --> 07:52.137
can be seen
through the Force.

07:52.139 --> 07:56.074
One could bring much chaos
with such hidden truths.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.909
I have seen it before.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.010
Well, we can't control
what Maul will do.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.847
That's his point, Ezra.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.149
Well, we still need it
to save our friends, Kanan.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.017
So, are you gonna
give it back, or not?

08:06.019 --> 08:09.754
Hmm. The object you seek
is a source of imbalance

08:09.756 --> 08:12.757
between you
and your teacher.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.961
If you want it, you must
seek it out with him.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.195
Where is it?

08:20.099 --> 08:22.200
BENDU: Somewhere safe.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.636
All right, I'll go,
but I'm going alone.

08:24.638 --> 08:29.140
The cave runs deep,
with many twists and turns.

08:29.142 --> 08:33.245
How can you be sure
where it is now? Huh?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.048
I hear something.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.919
If you listen,
you can hear it.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.057
I'll hold on to this.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.126
Kanan! The spiders...
Will attack as soon
as you turn it on.

08:48.128 --> 08:52.030
Use your comlink instead.
I'll try to guide you
from here.

08:52.032 --> 08:56.134
(SIGHS) I'd rather
have my lightsaber.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.036
Why take his weapon?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.738
He's gotta learn how to
solve problems without it.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.878
You will yield
to my power.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.893
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Here he comes.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.028
He makes an awful
lot of clanking.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.697
He is part droid.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.764
We can use that
against him.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.606
He's in the hold.

10:29.296 --> 10:33.131
only so long
as you're of use to me!

10:35.134 --> 10:37.268
Ezra, keep to the left.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.104
Left? You sure about that?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.138
KANAN: <i> Trust me.</i>

10:51.283 --> 10:53.685

<i>Ezra? What's happening?</i>

(STATIC FEEDBACK)

10:55.589 --> 10:56.921
Ezra? Ezra!

10:58.691 --> 11:00.892
Keep an eye on those,
will ya?

11:05.931 --> 11:10.368
Perhaps master
and apprentice will
rediscover their balance.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.172
Or perhaps
they'll be eaten.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.341
Such is the way of things.

11:17.143 --> 11:17.909
(GRUNTS)

11:22.648 --> 11:24.215
KANAN: Ezra, jump!

11:29.655 --> 11:33.024
What are you
doing in here?
Getting you back on track.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.244
How did you do that?
I can't even do that.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.714
Well, I've been forced
to see things differently
since Malachor.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.394
About what happened...

12:09.396 --> 12:12.731
I'm sorry for it.
For everything, Kanan.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.233
It wasn't your fault.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.038
I never blamed you, Ezra.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.807
It's time for you
to forgive yourself.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.780
Yes, Master.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.295
There it is.

12:54.140 --> 12:57.308
Stay calm.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.328
Steady.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.170
Kanan!
Don't be a threat.

13:25.172 --> 13:25.904
Go in peace.

13:39.451 --> 13:42.687
Your conflict has ended.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.256
Perhaps balance is restored.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.825
Thanks, Bendu.

13:46.827 --> 13:50.161
Your true struggle
has only begun.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.130
Be warned.

13:52.132 --> 13:57.368
The darksider
will not be able to open
your Jedi holocron.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.171
That task will fall
to one of you.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.608
So that means
we'll have the power
of both holocrons too.

14:03.610 --> 14:08.379
Do what you must,
but such power comes
with a price.

14:08.381 --> 14:13.418
Once a secret is known,
it cannot be unknown.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.660
KANAN: You wanted it,
now you got it.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.763
If you really think
it'll help us against Maul,
open it up.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.934
I'd rather hear
what you have to say.

14:30.636 --> 14:31.803
What's our plan?

14:33.339 --> 14:35.406
I think we oughta
play it by ear.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.141
How can you
take this lightly?

14:37.143 --> 14:41.145
The greatest power
Maul has is our fear
that he'll hurt our friends.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.214
We have to control
that fear.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.716
Stay relaxed.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.552
Okay, relaxed it is.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.386
You don't sound relaxed.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.456
Yeah, well, I look relaxed.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.785
MAUL: Over here, Master Jedi.

15:20.787 --> 15:24.489
Just follow
the sound of my voice.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.425
Easy.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.929
Welcome,
my young apprentice.

15:30.931 --> 15:34.799
I trust you found
the Sith holocron
illuminating?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.434
I don't see our friends.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.770
They will remain my guests

15:38.772 --> 15:41.940
until we conclude
our business.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.975
I will take you to them now.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.143
(DROIDS GRUNTING)

15:45.145 --> 15:48.379
Escort my apprentice
to the command center.

15:48.381 --> 15:53.651
Uh, if you attempt to escape,
or if the droids
are deactivated,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.920
your friends will die.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.221
Good to know.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.360
This way, Master Jedi.

16:12.671 --> 16:16.607
Truthfully, I was never
trying to blind you.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.077
Oh, no. You were just
trying to kill me.

16:19.079 --> 16:23.281
Well, if at first
you don't succeed...

16:23.283 --> 16:25.216
Hey!
Try, try again.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.685
(SHOUTING)

16:30.856 --> 16:32.323
No!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.275
(GRUNTS)

16:52.378 --> 16:54.212
(GASPING)

16:57.683 --> 17:00.218
(PANTING)

17:00.619 --> 17:01.753
(GRUNTS)

17:05.724 --> 17:07.291
(WHISPERS)
Terminate the prisoners.

17:07.293 --> 17:12.964
I lived up
to my end of the bargain.
Your friends are safe.

17:12.966 --> 17:15.299
Come, apprentice, sit.

17:16.001 --> 17:17.735
The holocron, if you please.

17:22.975 --> 17:27.745
I doubt that you
comprehend the power
that is within your grasp.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.681
I know if we open
these holocrons together,

17:30.683 --> 17:33.384
any question we ask
will be answered.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.054
So you do understand.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.924
Well, my apprentice,
what is your question?

17:39.926 --> 17:41.559
You know what I want.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.694
I want to destroy the Sith.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.698
You are as ambitious as ever.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.234
As for me, I seek
something much simpler,

17:50.236 --> 17:53.671
yet equally elusive.

17:53.673 --> 17:54.839
What's that?

17:55.574 --> 17:56.307
Hope.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.746
Now, let us begin.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.853
(DROIDS GRUNTING)

18:48.127 --> 18:50.228
(GRUNTS)

18:56.935 --> 18:59.971
Where's Ezra?
With Maul. Let's go.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.305
(GRUNTING)

19:01.307 --> 19:04.175
I see nothing.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.111
Only oblivion.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.079
I must go deeper.
Go deeper!

19:08.081 --> 19:10.748
Wait.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.649
I see something.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.918
What do you see?

19:13.920 --> 19:14.886
(SHOUTS) What is it?

19:15.154 --> 19:15.920
I see...

19:15.922 --> 19:17.188
Tell me.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.757
Tell me what you see!

19:21.026 --> 19:21.826
I see...

19:21.828 --> 19:23.761
HERA: Ezra!

19:23.763 --> 19:27.732
It's too bright.
Where is he?

19:32.871 --> 19:36.807
Ezra. I see him! Maul's close.
I'm going to get Ezra out.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.878
Be ready.
Wait. You see him?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.714
Kanan!

19:43.716 --> 19:46.651
KANAN: Ezra.
Ezra, listen to me!

19:46.653 --> 19:48.319
Look away!
Kanan?

19:48.321 --> 19:50.688
No! Stay focused,
apprentice.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.890
Gain the knowledge
you desire.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.959
Remember Bendu's warning.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.228
Turn away
before it's too late!

19:57.230 --> 19:59.230
But it's so close...

19:59.232 --> 20:02.033
The key to destroying
the Sith.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.935
Just a little farther.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.872
I see him!

20:07.874 --> 20:09.874
EZRA: Twin suns.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.743
It's not worth it, Ezra.
Trust me.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.817
(SHOUTS)

20:24.923 --> 20:27.158
(GROANS) Where's Maul?

20:29.995 --> 20:32.797
He lives.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.936
(LAUGHING)

20:38.938 --> 20:41.939
He lives!

20:41.941 --> 20:42.940
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

20:47.212 --> 20:51.349
Come on.
Find your way out, Ezra.
Come back to us.

20:51.351 --> 20:54.018
(GROANS) Oh!

20:54.020 --> 20:56.354
You okay, kid?

20:56.855 --> 20:58.789
I think so.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.124
Kanan, you...
You can see again?

21:00.126 --> 21:02.960
You can see me?

21:02.962 --> 21:06.130
I could, but only
through the light
of the holocrons.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.898
Do you know
what happened?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.968
I saw images,
pieces of something,

21:10.970 --> 21:12.937
but I... I can't
make sense of 'em.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.606
I don't know if it's
what I wanted to see

21:15.608 --> 21:17.341
or what Maul
was trying to see.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.644
What were they?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.779
Places, mostly.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.049
Planets.
Some familiar, some not.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.017
I'm not sure
what they mean.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.987
I'm sure we'll
find out together.
