can't be honored this way

59:07.240 --> 59:11.792
And I pray in my heart he'll forgive

59:11.920 --> 59:15.596
What you want now
are some words I can't say

59:15.720 --> 59:19.350
If I lied to you, how could I live?

59:19.480 --> 59:23.190
Don't say any more, not a word

59:23.320 --> 59:26.119
You will change, you will learn

59:26.240 --> 59:28.436
Look at me

59:28.560 --> 59:35.797
Don't decide too soon

59:38.080 --> 59:43.519
Somewhere deep in my soul

59:45.480 --> 59:49.076
Shines the smallest of lights

59:52.000 --> 59:55.118
And no wind blows it out

59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.836
It burns steady and strong

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:09.675
Through the darkest of nights

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.954
<i>Dju vui vay</i>

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.557
<i>Vju doi may</i>

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.039
<i>Dju vui vay</i>

<i>Vao nyay may</i>

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.999
I made a promise once
with these words

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.436
Which neither time nor distance
can change

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.314
He will come to me still

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.797
You must be mad,
your American Jack has gone for good

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.758
And he'll never come back

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.435
- He ran away, Kim, he left you to rot
- No

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.870
I'm sure by now he already forgot

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.277
Kim, come on now, princess,
get off of your cloud

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.676
I'm sorry, sir, she was talking so loud

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.793
The Commissar is a powerful man

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.310
A girl with brains
makes a life where she can

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.598
Princess, remember your place

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.712
Don't make people lose face

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.357
Why do you look away?

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.030
I can end all this shame

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.238
All you need to say is "yes"

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.989

- SOLDIERS: Breathing a sheet of flame

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.279
SOLDIERS:
Closing in on its rightful prey

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.232
I cannot change what I feel

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.591
- Burning a hundred years away
- Soldiers, come!

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.078
I think you will change before my eyes

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.519
She hid the day we closed the bars

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.357
Show them that we don't forget

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.631
No one betrays us without scars

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.319
- You are a woman who lived without shame
- You're an infection left over from war

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.195
- You have dishonored the national name
- Re-education will cure the disease

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.155
- You must be shown what we do to a leech
- See how we teach an American's whore

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.476
I have heard hundreds of speeches
like these

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.671
Take it from me,
you don't want to hear more

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.634
It's time to act, my friends

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.638
It's time

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.355
SOLDIERS: Her face betrays her crime

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.711
She must pay

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.914
- And her partner too

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.317

(SOLDIERS SHOUT)

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.677
Are you waiting for them to kill me?

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.473
Did you not get what he said?

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.632
There's a big screw loose inside you

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.353
I will rip it out of your head

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.671
There's a mad dog on a rampage

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.757
- Just appease him, everyone wins
- No

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.635
I don't give a shit if you love him,
say you do, and we leave with our skins

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.320
I have a husband I love

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.557
Real as the sun in the sky

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.195
- I cannot live with a lie
- You stupid...

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.277
Do you see now who has power?

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.357
Do you still think crazy things?

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.119
Chris will come to me like the phoenix

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.277
And he'll take me off on his wings

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.039
You're a traitor to your country

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.197
If I am, then let it be

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.232
ALL: I am talking of life or death now

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.477
I am talking of staying free

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.279
So there it is now,
I'll be moving on

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.393
If you don't need me, I'd rather be gone

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.196
Two kids in love
don't need strangers around

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.960
- You, just get out!
- Ho Chi Minh, I won't make a sound

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.154
And as for you

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.077
- Come with me
- No!

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.433
There is a secret

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.794
That you don't know

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.271
There is a force here

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.794
I never show

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.753
You say it's treason

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.874
To keep my vow

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.916
Season after season

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.592
I've survived somehow

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.237
If you want the reason

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.593
I will show you now

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.190
Tam!

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.960
It's OK.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.997
Look, Thuy, this is my son

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.075
He is all that I have

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:43.390
Now you see why I must tell you "no"

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.749
No one must ever see
this thing you're showing me

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.633
Your bastard fouls our name

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.237
My baby's not to blame
for what I've done

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.076
You must decide upon
which side you're really on

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.796
- You whored to have that kid
- No! That isn't what I did

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.354
Don't touch my son

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.839
You must see how it is

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.679
When you're my wife

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.113
Keeping this child of his
brands us for life

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.471
No alternative, this child cannot live

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600
No!

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.956
You will not touch him

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:31.915
- Don't touch my boy
- Kim

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:36.000
He's what I live for

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:41.479
He's my only joy

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.552
- You will not touch him
- He is my enemy

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.353
It's he who turns you from me

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.035
- Don't touch my boy
- Erase him from your life

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.640
Even your memory

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.656
- He's what I live for
- He's one drop in a flood

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.876
Left here to taint our blood

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.515
- He's my only joy
- Our marriage bond is sworn

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.994
Forget that he was born

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:58.951
Get back!

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.912
Of course you have a gun

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.192
- You will not touch my little boy
- And now you'll shoot your cousin

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.117
And it's a US gun

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.471
- And do not test my will
- A gun that lost the war

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.353
You're the corrupted one

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.320
- I'm warning you
- Go on and shoot, don't wait

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.710
- For him I'll kill
- To save your bastard son

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.236
You must not hesitate

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.919
The earth moves where I stand

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.560
- I feel the turning of a wheel
- Shoot

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.393
- I feel nothing in my hand
- Shoot

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.194
- Not even the chill of steel
- Shoot

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.312
You will not take my child

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.636

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.513
I have no other choice

get him out of here, goodbye

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.637
- Fuck!
- We must leave, Tam and I

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.229
We must set off for America tonight

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.269
All right, just like that

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.474
Tell me how
and while you're at it, tell me why

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.995
I hear the voice of my soldier

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.238
Telling me to bring his son

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.790
You're telling me this half-breed brat
is born the son of a Marine?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.396
Let me see his Western nose

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.680
This bastard is the most beautiful sight
I've ever seen

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.273
A passport in my hand

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.079
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.396
My new life can begin

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.031
Your brat's American

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.114
So they must let us in

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:06.952
In the playground of mankind

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.592
The movie in my mind

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.636
I'm your dear brother from now on

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.911
And all our family is gone

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.112
Boy, kiss your brand-new Uncle Tran

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.797
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.798
This kid is OK

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.750
He is our <i>entrée</i>

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.399
To the USA

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.558
With these two little diamonds
to bait my hooks

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.634
I'll book us on a cruise:
"Boat people deluxe"

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.356
Don't worry about sharks
out in the Mekong Bay

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.439
The pirates taking us
are more scary any day

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.439
You just stay here and hide,
don't show your face outside

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.918
Take care of our little dear,
I will go engineer

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.919
If you want to die in bed

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.431
Don't care too much for country

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.399
Hit the open sea instead

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.231
And float there like a cork

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.714
Yeah, why not?

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.152
Uncle Ho

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.193
- (MIMICS ELVIS) Oh-ho ho-ho-ho...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.075
I'll have to call you from New York

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.956
New York

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.112
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS)

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.990
You who I cradled in my arms

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.390
You asking as little as you can

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.995
Little snip of a little man

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.514
I know I'd give my life for you

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.837
You didn't ask me to be born

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.077
You

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:58.232
Why should you learn of war or pain?

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:03.310
To make sure you're not hurt again

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.830
I swear I'd give my life for you

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.516
I've tasted love beyond all fear

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.317
And you should know
it's love that brought you here

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.512
And in one perfect night

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.553
When the stars burned like new

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.799
I knew what I must do

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.439
I'll give you a million things
I'll never own

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:44.238
I'll give you a world to conquer
when you're grown

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.995
You will be who you want to be

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:58.072
You can choose whatever heaven grants

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.520
As long as you can have your chance

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.680
I swear I'll give my life for you

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.674
Some nights I wake up
reaching for him

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.119
I feel his shadow brush my head

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.871
But it's just moonlight on my bed

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.038
Was he a ghost? Was he a lie?

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.631
That made my body laugh and cry

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.596
Then by my side,
the proof I see, his little one

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.677
Gods of the sun

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:47.991
Bring him to me

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.469
You will be who you want to be

01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:01.599
You can choose
whatever heaven grants

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.952
As long as you can have your chance

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.632
I swear I'd give my life for you

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.512
No one can stop what I must do

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.040
I swear

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:32.000
I'd give my life for you

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.919
ALL: No place, no home

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.193
No life, no hope

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.916
No chance, no change

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.193
- No regret, no return
- No place, no home

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.633
- No regret, no return
- No life, no hope

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.277
- No regret, no return
- No chance, no change

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:18.400
One day, one night

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.953
One day

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS)

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.070

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.671
The dust of life

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:07.957
Conceived in hell and born in strife

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:12.074
They are the living reminder

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.479
Of all the good we failed to do

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:24.599
We can't forget, must not forget,
that they are all our children too

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:36.878
Like all survivors, I once thought
when I'm home, I won't give a damn

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.789
But now I know I'm caught

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.200
I'll never leave Vietnam

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.439
War isn't over when it ends

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.758
Some pictures never leave your mind

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.032
They are the faces of the children

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:01.035
The ones we left behind

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.113
They're called Bui Doi

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.112
The dust of life

Conceived in hell and born in strife

They are the living reminder

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.676
Of all the good we failed to do

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:29.594
We can't forget, must not forget,
that they are all our children too

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.476
These kids hit walls on every side

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.195
They don't belong in any place

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:43.234
Their secret they can't hide

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.718
It's printed on their face

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:55.111
I never thought one day I'd plead
for half-breeds from a land that's torn

01:23:55.240 --> 01:24:02.750
But then I saw a camp for children
whose crime was being born

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.590
They're called Bui Doi

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.679
The dust of life

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:16.320
Conceived in hell and born in strife

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.719
We owe them fathers and a family

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.309
A loving home they never knew

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.320
Because we know deep in our hearts

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.275
That they are all our children too

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.112
These are souls in need

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.438
They need us to give

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.716
Someone has to pay
for their chance to live

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.231
- Help me try

Of all the good we failed to do

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.512
- That's why we know
- That's why we know

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.792
- Deep in our hearts
- That deep down in our hearts

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:19.877
- That's why we know
- That they are all

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:27.032

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.877
- Look at you.
- John, you were great.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.753
Can I see you alone?

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.718
I've got to know
what you meant on the phone

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.430
Hey, what is this news you received
you could only tell me?

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.635
A lot of groups use my Bangkok staff
to process problems on their behalf

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:13.070
We got this in from the embassy

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.352
It's not easy to tell you,
it's best that you see

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.512
Kim. It's about Kim, isn't it?

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.076
Only you know how hard
I have tried to get word

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.873
Tell me first, nothing else,
tell me did she survive?

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.198
You should read the report, Chris,
but yes, she's alive

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.551
You don't know, John, these nightmares

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.639
The things that I've seen

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.033
I-I've seen her face burned,
seen her shot with my gun

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.596
I've chased her through streets
and heard nothing but screams

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.355
What's wrong? Come on,
there is still something more

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.840
She has a child

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:09.476
You have a son

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.037
You won't believe me,
but I dreamed this, John

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.949
He's in the nightmare when I see Saigon

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.834
- Jesus, John, I am married
- I know

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.112
Is this story for real?

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.472
I'm only telling you what I received

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.399
But our reports can usually be believed

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.716
Kim's a bar girl in Bangkok

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.877
Pal, I know how you feel

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.560
It's too late!
I have a whole new life

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:52.832
I have a wife I love,
she can't just disappear

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.111
Listen, Chris,
I know the shock you've had

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.153
It isn't always bad,
there are solutions here

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.911
John, I never told her

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.637
My wife, how can I tell her?

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.519
A child, what can I do?

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.956
Oh, Jesus, Kim

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.116
What can I do?

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.232
I have learned the best thing
for a couple to do

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.829
How can I tell her?

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.599
You should both go to Bangkok

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:26.157
- I have to tell her
- I mean Ellen too

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.876
Us both?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.356
You both should go

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.359
Hey, guys, come on

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.952
But first... First Ellen has to know

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.430
What?

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.196
- Are you OK?
- No.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.119
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.072
Come on. Fuck.

- You're nothing but second-rate...
- I'll get back to work, boss.

Son of a bitch. Hey, you looking
for a girl? What can I get you?

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.159
You want a big-breasted girl?
Hey, you're back!

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.833
I told you that girl was clean.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.078
What can I get you this time?
A girl that looks like a boy?

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.795
A boy who looks like a girl?
Or someone who looks like this?

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.310
- Yeah!

- I got girls
- You'll thank me later.

- Gorgeous girls
- I'm glad my wife's not here with me

The way she moves.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.317

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.833
What a waste

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.911
To pay for my keep,
I'm rounding up sheep

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.430
To fleece here in Bangkok

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:14.518

There's nothing as dead
as peace here in Bangkok

Ten cents an hour,
that's the most they pay

I'll have to swim to the USA

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.752
Special offer on pussies,
buy one, get one free

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.599
If you're looking for fun,
original sin

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.677
If you want to put out,
then you've gotta come in

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.200
- Girls
- Hey, boys

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.960
- Don't stand around like wimps
- I got girls

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.549
Watch out, those guys,
they're really pimps

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:51.240
- Pearls
- You want some thrills?

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.192
- Come on and grab it
- Half the price

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:56.313
Two girls, a gerbil and a rabbit

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.114
- Nasty stuff, you like that
- Hey, come to me

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.678
- Look what you'll see
- Ping pong, ha

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:04.870
Hey, that's a joke

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.515
Mine blows smoke for a small extra fee

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.917
Hey, Joe, try taking a little excursion

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.680
You'll all feel good
from a little perversion

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:21.350
- Oh, yeah?
- Massage requiring total immersion

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.949
- Oh, wow!
- Some strange positions

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.713
- They say are Persian
- Oh, no!

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.877
- I am a Mormon!
- Drinks are on me

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.033
Yeah, baby! Go! First girl is free

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.757
Hey, what can I say?
You get me for a small extra fee

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.514
It was only a joke.

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.078
You want a girl, sir?
You'll like one of these

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.999
You have a Kim here?
Can I see her, please?

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.440
You pick 'em well.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.432
Monsieur John. Is that you?

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.954
The Engineer?
Jesus Christ, you're here too?

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:03.275
Oh, you

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.154
Of all my friends,
you're the one that I miss

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.794
- I'm looking for Kim
- I love you so

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.479
You and your buddy Chris

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.432
I'm here about him;
Kim has a child

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.153
- Born in
- '75

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.796
I filled that out,
and it's you who arrive

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:22.040
You'll find the end of your quest
here in our little dive

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.994
Man, I'm impressed

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.110
American clerks,
a system that works

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.631
- There's really no other
- Listen, spare me the gas

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.831
Is there really a child?

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.952
Oh, yes, we're blessed

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.677
And Kim's on a trip for citizenship

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.439
And I am her brother

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.392
You're her brother, my ass

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.318
Come on, take me inside

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.274
Look, Kim, who got our application

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:07.155
I said I'd bring us all salvation

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.193
Oh, my God, Monsieur John,
yes, of course he sent you

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.313
Not in here,
is there someplace near we could talk?

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.720
Take your hands off, she's finished,
go find someone else

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:19.880
Come with me,
there's a lot I've got to say first

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.878
Chris is here, say he's here

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.037
Oh, my God, it's all true

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:29.150
I suggest whatever may be,
you leave this to me

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.237
Just play little mother

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.158
- What I need to find out
- Anything

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.237
She can tell me alone

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.556
(MEN SHOUT)

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.833
Can you take me to Chris?
I can leave here right now

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.031
- We
- We've been here for so long

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.676
- I took this job to survive
- One month at sea

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.871
I was sure we'd drown

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.596
But I thought about Chris
and we didn't go down

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.191
I've done terrible things,
but we're safe and you're here

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.479
So perhaps all the gods
have begun to forgive

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.360
Has the gentleman ordered champagne?

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.709
She was about to get it

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.514
You'd better get back on the chain,
or get out

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.917
- Monsieur John
- I am sick of that prick

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.760
- Quick, before he gets wise
- Look at this

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.918
Let John look at our kid,
see the lids of his eyes?

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.555
- Come see, love
- Let John have his surprise

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:26.038
- Come see Chris
- Open a bottle!

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.956
Look, Uncle Sam, hey?

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.519
How nice I am

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:40.353
I'm doing all this just for Tam

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.312
An American boy

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.553
Look, John, this is his son

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.273
(SPEAKS VIETNAMESE)

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:04.394
- Give me five.
- Don't they have the same smile?

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:15.155
He's been waiting for his father
for a long, long while

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.836
I'm not here as a friend

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.158
I have a job to do

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:30.311
It's strange to find my work
should lead me here to you

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:35.193
Chris knows all about you,
I have shown him all this

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.951
But I think that it's time you know
all about Chris

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.677
Yes, tell me everything, I beg you

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:47.912
How I've longed for this to start

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.238
All my prayers are finally answered

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.591
This is too much for one heart

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:57.839
Kim, he went crazy when he lost you

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:00.475
Spoke to no one for a year

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.198
Then he finally said, "I'm home now"

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.920
"My life has to go on here"

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.316
- What are you talking about?
- Kim

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.558
Let me finish talking, please

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:16.594
That was three whole years ago

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.872
Yes, yes, I know

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.477
I know how pain can grow

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.994
When the rock you hold on to
is a love miles away

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.759
Listen, please

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.078
I already know the story

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:37.511
Take us to the USA, John

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.394
When we're finished here, you'll see him

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:47.717
Chris arrived with me today

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:51.072
Oh, Tam, he's here

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.560
He's here, he's so near

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.991
We might breathe the same air tonight

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.800
Your father's here

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.277
- I dreamed so hard
- I can't tell her like this

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.154
- I kept my faith
- I should not be the one

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.911
- And now it's true
- Chris must first see his son

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:12.271
- Now I can see
- They don't say in the files

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.756
- We've been watched over
- There's a woman in love

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.873
- And our life's about to start
- Here

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.753
- What I see in her eyes
- Sun and moon

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.997
- Will be together
- Chris don't know nothing of

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:29.197
BOTH: This is too much for one heart

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.600
(KIM LAUGHS)

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.713
There's only one thing I can do

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.719
I must bring Chris here to see you

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.991
- Thank you.
- OK.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.157
I thought I said no kids around

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.238
So what's the brat doing here?

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:56.916
You better take care,
I'm watching both of you

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.033
You and your Engineer

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.992
Sir, would you like a massage?

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.032
No, thanks, it's not my scene

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.436
I can get boys from La Cage

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.077
- Whatever, man. Get out of my way.
- Watch out, sir! Sir!

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.918
Why is he leaving?

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.394
What is that look?

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:16.749
He was right on the hook

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.837
Don't tell me he slipped free

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.477
Engineer, Chris is here

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.753
John is going to get him
and bring him to me

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.480
My heart's ready to burst

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.435
I don't know what I'll tell him first

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.950
That guy is no one to trust

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:39.313
Or a soldier who just learned
he fathered a son

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.033
You got to get to Chris first

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.597
I will find his address now
before he can run

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:48.430
- Stupid
- You can trust what he'll do

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:53.794
- Don't you worry, I'll mention you
- You'll mention me?

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.550
Don't screw with me, little bitch,
I don't want any hitch

01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.160
You just do as you're told

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.272
You go to his hotel

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.675
I'll be working as well

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.757
Guarding our bag of gold

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.356
Tell me where and I'll go

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:16.272
He'll be longing for me, I know

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.432
You have brought me
through the lightning

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.394
You have watched me from afar

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.675
You know all and you forgive me

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.998
Loving parents that you are

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.912
- Please
- Go on, talk to your ghosts

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.238
- May your daughter have your blessing
- Little girl, till you're blue

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.319
On the life about to start

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.150
- You have one chance, just one
- We must journey to a new world

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.639
- He's here, talking to you
- This is too much for one heart

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.280
I'll fix this

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.119
Make yourself pretty.

(WIND HOWLS)

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:59.038
Did you think I'd gone away?

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:05.794
I am the man you killed that day

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:12.156
Cold, with a bullet inside my chest

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.751
My corpse may be sleeping

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.915
But my soul won't rest

I'm the crime that you hid

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:29.600
You can try,
but you'll never forget what you did

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:36.559
You will never be free

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:42.836
Not as long as there's me

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.957
Did you think you would escape
the judgment that was planned?

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.637
Did you think you would escape
the truth's avenging hand?

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.152
Just because you have escaped
the boundaries of your land?

I'm here,
I am the guilt inside your head

You think
your Marine's not like other men

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.517
He betrayed you once

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.793
And he will again

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.480
Think about that night

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:29.597
Where was he back then?

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.279
I'm getting you out! Let's go!

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.196
Sorry, Sergeant, as things degenerate

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.559
I mean Vietnamese,
hey, don't get me wrong

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:17.356
Can't save these looks for the Cong,
right? Get in there

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.434
Christ, I'm due at the embassy,
no time to lose

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:23.916
I don't want you to leave me today

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.635
Well, at least Uncle Sam
bought our honeymoon cruise

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:30.316
- If you're going, I don't want to stay
- Look, I'm leaving my gun

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.717
- We've got time, stay and pack
- I will do whatever you say

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.877
I'll get plenty of word
when the VC attack

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.232
I want you in that bed waiting
when I get back

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:43.718
Sorry, Sergeant, we must accelerate,
State Department says we evacuate

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:46.799
The word is, we must be out by dawn

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.389
Sorry, Sergeant,
it's straight from Washington

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.512
No one leaves the grounds now,
not anyone

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.599
As fast as we load the planes,
we're gone, go!

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.517
OK, keep quiet, don't shout

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.439
The ambassador won't leave
till everyone's out

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.394
The choppers are on their way
have room for you all

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:05.830
They're climbing over the wall

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.077
Get back, get back,
I tell you, don't shout

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.795
The ambassador won't leave
till everyone's out

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.992
The ambassador
just sent an order to freeze

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.511
That's it, no more Vietnamese, get in

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.120
Lock the gates

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.960
I'm the wife of a soldier,
please let me through

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:27.599
Wait, help me, who must I pay?
Tell me what I must do

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.518
- Chris!
- Let me out

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.235
- No!
- I've got to get back for my bride

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.638
No, listen, someone,
my husband is waiting inside

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.077
Please, Kim, hear the phone

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.635
I can't get there

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.871
Please be home

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.595
Please, Chris

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.755
No one sees I am lost here

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.758
Find me, please

01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.554
BOTH: Please get me through,
I don't care how

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.151
Don't take my love away, not now

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:11.277
- Oh, Chris, I can't get free
- Please get free

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.960
- Still I'm with you
- CHRIS: I am with you

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.352
BOTH: Wait for me

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.279
Sorry, Sergeant, inside the embassy

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:24.598
We are pulling out now
and there will be no more reprieves

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.916
I've got till the old man leaves

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.477
Chris, don't be an ass!
The ambassador is leaving now

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.079
- Take me with you
- Take my children

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.840
- I have a letter here
- I helped the CIA

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:40.520
CHORUS: They'll kill who they find here

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.109
Don't leave us behind here

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.550
I've a wife who left already

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.080
I have an aunt in New York

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.554
I have gold, I can pay

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.876
CHORUS: There is no one to find here

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.560
They have left us behind here

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:56.320
I must get in there, listen, anyone

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.432
Please tell my husband,
look, I have his gun

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.438
Out of my way
if that's all that you've got

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:03.314
If I am here when they come,
I'll be shot

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.480
(SCREAMING)

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.592
Let me go, John, I can't leave her

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:10.952
Why in the world
should I be saved instead of her?

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.515
CHORUS: They'll kill who they find here

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.597
Don't leave us behind here

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.719
- Get off!
- It's not you, it's war that's cruel

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:21.674
And if some dreams get smashed,
perhaps it's best they were

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.235
CHORUS: There is no one to find here

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.670
They have left us behind here

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:29.360
Wake up, my friend,
your mercy trip has failed

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.711
There's nothing you can do,
that ship has sailed

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.230
She's not the only one
we'll have betrayed

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.239
CHORUS: Get to the roof
or else we are betrayed

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.876
KIM: Oh, Chris

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.674
I still believe

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:49.114
The heart of you is here with me

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:57.239
My heart against all odds holds still

01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.912
(PANICKED SHOUTING)

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.836
(HELICOPTER APPROACHES)

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:09.112
(SHOUTING)

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.636
(ROTORS DROWN OUT SHOUTING)

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.909
Kim!

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.472
Please!

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.879
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS)

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:14.759
You are sunlight

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.556
And I, moon

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:24.912
Joined by the gods of fortune

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.674
Midnight and high noon

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:36.316
That's what we are

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.791
How in one night

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:47.156
Have we come so far?

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:55.438
Outside, day starts to dawn

01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:02.000
One long nighttime has gone

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:03.873
I feel you near

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.559
I reach your place

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.473
I know you're here

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.956
I touch your face

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:17.078
And our love is reborn

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.955
(CHUCKLES)

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:37.319
Brightening the sky

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:39.796
With the flame

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:46.198
Of love

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:51.395
Made of

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.151
Sunlight

01:51:56.280 --> 01:52:03.039
Moonlight

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.560
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.031
ENGINEER: Kim. Kim.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.271
I've found Chris. He's at this hotel.

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.438
Go! I'll take care of Tam.
Don't screw this up.

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:18.440
Yes!

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.312
(ANIMATED CHATTER)

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.040
Oh!

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.517
- I'm sorry.
- Don't turn the bed yet, thank you.

01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:55.840
- I'm not the maid.
- Oh. Well, how can I help you?

01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:59.672
- 317?
- Yes.

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:01.678
Christopher Scott's room?

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:07.119
Oh, God, I see.
I know who you are.

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.192
You must be Kim

01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:15.314
- Chris went to find you
- (LAUGHS)

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.114
Please come inside

01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.596
No one will hurt you

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:24.316
I'm Chris's wife

01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.759
My name is Ellen.

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:47.630
In a way,
I'm glad I'm meeting you first

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:53.594
Understand, you were only a name
till tonight

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.194
I don't know how I'd feel
if our roles were reversed

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.071
Tell me you are lying

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.796
ELLEN: We've been married two years,
I'm sorry, it's true

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:10.674
- He said he'd come to get me
- He said he tried to reach you

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.794
- But what could he do?
- Please tell me you're not married

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:18.197
You don't know,
you can't know what I've done to be here

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.960
You don't know how he needed a new start

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:24.511
I feel walls in my heart closing in

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.714
I can't breathe, I can't win

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:33.879
And your child, you say it's Chris's

01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:40.675
Oh, yes, madame, my son is Chris's

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.558
I had a dream for my son to belong

01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:47.149
Not live his life in the street
like a rat

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.352
We aren't rich,
but we'll give what we can

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.030
Chris and I are totally together on that

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.957
Then you must take Tam with you

01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.276
Take a child from his mother?
Impossible, Kim

01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:02.111
You must take Tam with you

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.436
Then he'll get what I wanted for him

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:06.756
But, Kim, your child needs you

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:09.435
Chris is married to me,
we want kids of our own

01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:12.792
Tam's chance lies with you now,
not with me

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:15.799
- Please
- No, it won't work

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:19.516
He's your child, he's not mine

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:23.196
If you're saying that
because you made him change his mind

01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:26.711
Chris must go away
and leave me and his son behind

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.912
If you're saying that
because my husband has another wife

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.080
My child has no future
like the dust of life

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.831
Chris must come tonight to my place,
tell me so to my face

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:40.758
Kim! Kim!

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:46.229
Chris

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.033
Why aren't you here now?

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:54.477
I don't understand,
I really need you here

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.119
Please

01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.954
Please, help me

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:06.553
Am I fooling myself

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.755
If I've already lost you?

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:15.840
Nothing's changed, you're still mine

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:21.194
We can try to ignore this

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:26.912
But if she has come back in your life

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:33.873
Well, then maybe you were never mine

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:40.520
And yet my heart cries maybe

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.149
It's a trick, it's a lie

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.992
She's just trying to use you

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:51.351
But I looked in her eyes

01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:56.151
It could kill her to lose you

01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.155
And maybe

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:06.590
Just maybe you need her, too

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.952
Back when we met
you were broken and wild

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.030
And I held you at night
and I ached when you cried

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:21.439
But despite what we lacked
we tried staying on track

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.995
No regret

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:32.313
Yet maybe

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:40.035
It was fate
that suddenly brought her back to you

01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:47.795
And your love was true love
before I even knew you

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:53.996
If the life of your dreams
is the life she is giving

01:57:54.120 --> 01:58:01.596
Should I be the one
to stop your dream from living?

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:09.600
If you're hers, then be hers
and forget about me now

01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.031
I've been blind for so long

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:16.951
But perhaps I can see now

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:20.437
And maybe

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:24.759
Just maybe

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:32.356
I'll find the strength
I need to set you free now

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:34.631
I'll be strong, I'll stand firm

01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:40.438
So my tears won't betray me

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:44.918
But my heart might just break

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:50.231
If what may be

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:57.392
May be

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.592
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS)

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.798
We couldn't find her anywhere

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:19.236
Honey, what's wrong?

01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:21.829
Kim was here;
the one who had to tell her was me

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.878
Oh, my God,
I knew we were gone too long

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.391
No, I think
it's exactly what I had to see

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:34.035
You said you slept with her,
that's all you were

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:38.040
Only one thing you left out
is that you loved her, God

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.550
Yes, we were in love,
but it was years ago

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.239
We were torn apart

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:44.631
Don't explain,
there's nothing you can say

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:48.515
It's like she's gone insane,
she tried to give away her own child

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.279
- Ellen
- You weren't here

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.471
I saw the look in her eyes,
don't you see?

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:53.920
She thinks she is married to you

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.520
- What?
- You must tell her she's not

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.838
She must hear it from you!
Course, it only depends if it's true

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.038
Hey, don't you doubt me, Ellen

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.152
You're my wife

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:09.234
Lots of guys came back and had no life

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.829
I had you

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.759
Hey.

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:19.549
You can say what you want
but she's borne you a son

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:20.909
Ellen

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.637
In your nightmares,
the name that you shouted was hers

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:28.070
- I know
- You've been married two years

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.994
But not shared things you've done

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:32.594
- I'm sorry
- Don't

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:35.758
Don't, don't hold back

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.032
Let me see

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:43.951
Is it her now or me?

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:46.276
(SIGHS)

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.797
Let me tell you the way it was

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:03.320
Back when I was a different man

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:08.396
Back when I didn't have a clue
what was right

02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:14.111
They drafted me and shipped me out

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:19.031
To wind up in that senseless fight

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:25.509
There, in the shambles of a war

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:31.079
I found what I was looking for

02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.352
Saigon was crazed, but she was real

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:40.920
And for one moment I could feel

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:47.150
I saw a world I never knew

02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.678
And through her eyes, I suffered too

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.396
God, in spite of all the things
that were

02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:01.312
I started to believe in her

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:04.797
So I wanted to save her,
protect her

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.314
Christ, I'm an American

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:09.274
How could I fail to do good?

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:13.552
All I made was a mess,
just like everyone else

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:18.875
In a place full of mystery
that I never once understood

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.390
I wanted back a world I knew

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:25.837
The story of my life
began again with you

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:28.759
It's all right now

02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:31.080
- That's all through
- No, Ellen, I should have told you

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:36.639
- We'll get past this, start anew
- Will you ever trust me again?

02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:42.916
- All I want in my life now
- All I have in my life now

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:47.757
BOTH: Is you

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:50.230
Hey. You guys OK?

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.079
Kim was here.

02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:58.679
My God, alone?

02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:02.316
Yeah, while we were out looking for her.

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.632
- You need some time?
- No, we're OK now.

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:12.990
Have you discussed Tam?

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:17.480
Look...

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.673
I run a camp that is filled with Bui Doi

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.237
Looking for the fathers
that they may never find

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:29.398
I don't know what I'd do
if Tam were my boy

02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:32.035
Do you want to take him out
or leave him behind?

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:34.675
He's my son, I won't abandon him

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.356
Except that, Jesus Christ, John,
there is also Kim

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.914
What of her?

02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.750
If it were only Tam we'd take him now

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.715
He's Chris's son,
we'd make it work somehow

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:50.639
But, John, she still loves him

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:53.150
How can we have her there?

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.835
There's no choice,
I think the answer's clear

02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:58.759
They'll have to stay in Bangkok,
we'll support them here

02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:00.473
I think this is the answer

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.399
You didn't see
what's in that girl's head

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.319
- For now, this is the answer
- I hope you're both proud

02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:08.272
Of what you've just said

02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.710
- Is it done?
- It's done

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:12.678
BOTH: It's planned

02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:16.595
Kim is smart, she'll understand

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.433
You must take Tam with you

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:21.200
In Bangkok,
he will go to American schools

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.233
I won't break my promise to my son

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:27.194
- He will start a new life
- You will take Tam with you

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.440
- JOHN: It's not right
- We'll provide for their needs

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:30.914
You're both talking like fools

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.078
You won't forget Tam is a part of you

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.793
We will do what is right

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:37.593
Right for Tam

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.951
Right for us

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.279
And for Kim

02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:52.637
I still taste your kisses

02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:02.313
Your voice sings in my ear

02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:08.152
You can betray what we were yesterday

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:14.436
But you'll come back tonight for him

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.597
(LIVELY CHATTER)

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:26.835
Hey, Kim

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:33.076
Come on, come on, your recitation

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.557
Describe your reconciliation

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.957
I hope, before his stimulation

02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:43.152
He bought our little group vacation

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:48.400
In all his dreams he saw our baby

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:51.917
And he's teaching him to fly

02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:54.680
Paper dragons in the sky

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:57.156
Yes, papers, what's the situation?

02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:00.877
We'll need our cards for immigration

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:05.590
No tricks, I've got my reputation

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:08.679
Don't want no phony complication

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:12.350
No, no

02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:15.473
He's coming to us tonight

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:18.517
Pack your things, get yourself arranged

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:22.759
While I change for my last performance

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.314
Oh, I'll pack.

02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:28.878
Me, Chris and you?
Yeah? What a <i>ménage!</i>

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:33.589
Bangkok can screw

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.154
<i>Bon voyage!</i>

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.476
I'm going to America!

02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:40.239
I'm gonna smoke you soon.

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:48.478
My father was a tattoo artist
in Haiphong

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.474
But his designs on Mother
didn't last too long

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:59.158
My mother sold her body,
high on betel nuts

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.714
Oh...!

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:07.399
My job was bringing red-faced <i>messieurs</i>
to our huts

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:10.433
Selling your mom is a wrench

02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:13.718
Perfume can cover a stench

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:17.800
That's what I learned from the French

02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:25.795
Then it all changed with Dien Bien Phu
(SCOFFS)

02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:30.836
The Frogs went home; who came?
(AMERICAN ACCENT) Guess who

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:35.678
Are you surprised we went insane

02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:41.350
With dollars pouring down like rain?

02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:45.635
Businessmen never rob banks

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:48.838
I can sell shit and get thanks

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:53.671
Now, that's what I learned
from the Yanks

02:07:54.920 --> 02:08:00.075
I'm fed up with small-time hustles

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:04.630
I'm too good
to waste my talent for greed

02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:12.671
I need room to flex my muscles

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:17.636
In an ocean where the big sharks feed

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:20.831
Make me Yankee

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.231
They're my family

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:29.874
We're selling dreams people need

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.472
(SNIFFS) Oh

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.394
What's that I smell in the air?

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:41.514
The American dream

02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:43.438

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:48.435

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:52.319
The American dream

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.600
Pre-packed and ready to wear

02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:01.111
My American dream

02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:06.440
Fat like a chocolate eclair

02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:11.589
As I... (SLURPS)
suck out the cream

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.750
<i>Au revoir,</i> Miss Saigon

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:19.156
I'm moving on

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:22.800
Grab what you can till it's gone

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.834
The American dream

02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.914
Greasy Chinks make life so sleazy

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:35.152
In the States,
I'll have a club that's four-starred

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.796
Men like me there have things easy

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.800
I'll have a lawyer and a bodyguard

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:48.274
To the johns there,
I'll sell blondes there

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.236
That they can charge on a card

02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.677
Tshk-tshk!

02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:02.518
Oh, what's that I smell in the air?

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:04.996
The American dream

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:12.510
Sweet as a suite in Bel Air

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:16.156
The American dream

02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.118
Girls can buy tits by the pair

Bald people think they'll grow hair

The American dream

02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.039
Asses that stick out to there

02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.550
The American dream

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:46.800

It's time we all entertain
my American dream

02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:21.556
I want my girls

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:25.551
Don't you just love the feathers?

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:29.230
Blow your big daddy a kiss!

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:31.153
Oh, come on down.

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:34.472
I want to see my queen of the town.

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:38.389
Come on, baby. Rise and shine.

02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:40.352
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:44.078
She's alive! She's alive!

02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.237
Look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:49.592
She's a big girl. She needs big boys.

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:53.600
- Hello, boys!
- Yeah! Yeah!

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:58.397
You guys are big. American big.

02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:00.318
Think you can handle her?

02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:04.439
I love you, lady, I love you.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.319
You make me moist.

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:10.280
- We're just sexy bitches, aren't we?
- GIRLS: Oh

Winner, winner!

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.550

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.920
Sure can

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:37.874
Soon you will buy it from me

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:39.354
The American...

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:43.231
Dream! Dream! Dream! Dream!

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:02.752
Hey!

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:04.872
Where's my money going?

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:09.118
Where are you guys going? Come back!

02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:11.391
It was just getting good.

02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:15.319
Wasn't that fabulous?

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.472
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:24.229
That's what I smell in the air
(INHALES DEEPLY)

02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:26.397
My American dream

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:28.920
Oh!

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.072
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS)

02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.596
Now, Tam, my brave boy

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:26.034
Our long wait has ended

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:35.074
Smile, Tam,
for you have a father at last

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.472
He has come to take you home

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:45.595
All I dreamed for you he'll do

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.757
You're still mine

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.633
But I can't go along

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.040
Don't be sad; though I'm far away,
I'll be watching you

02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.590
This is the hour

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:06.033
I swore I'd see

02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:10.871
I alone can tell now

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.993
What the end must be

02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:19.436
They think they'll decide your life

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:25.112
No, it will be me

02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:42.070
Look at me one more time

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:48.517
Don't forget what you see

02:16:48.639 --> 02:16:50.518
One more kiss

02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:02.199
And then say goodbye

02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:54.589
(GUNSHOT)

02:17:55.719 --> 02:17:57.712
(GASPS)

02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:01.749
Kim!

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.472
Kim! Oh, my God!

02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:23.355
What have you done, Kim?

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:25.874
Why?

02:18:27.959 --> 02:18:33.638
The gods have guided you to your son

02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:38.034
Oh, Jesus!

02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:43.119
Please, don't die

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.275
Hold me

02:18:48.639 --> 02:18:50.915
One last time

02:19:03.639 --> 02:19:04.994
I've got you.

02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:33.117
How in one night

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:39.832
Have we come so far?

02:19:43.559 --> 02:19:45.153
CHRIS: Hey.

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.880
Kim. (CRIES)

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.320
Kim!

02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:15.750
No! Kim!

02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:32.752
