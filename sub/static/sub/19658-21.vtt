That's right, Adam.
Because any weapon

12:09.399 --> 12:11.227
Cosmo cannot retrieve.

12:11.406 --> 12:13.406
[Drax]
Her comm link does not respond.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.219
Which means it's up to me,
as per krutackin' usual.

12:17.305 --> 12:19.116
[beeps]
I am Groot?

12:19.197 --> 12:21.176
'Cause I was once
a part of his collection,

12:21.234 --> 12:22.993
so I know his ship
better than anyone.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.833
Plus I got a sweet tooth
for payback.

12:25.891 --> 12:28.844
We'll follow in the Milano and
distract him with some fireworks.

12:29.072 --> 12:30.828
Make 'em pretty.

12:45.109 --> 12:46.195
[grunting]

12:46.922 --> 12:48.609
Gammy? That you?

12:49.524 --> 12:50.883
Flarg!

12:56.859 --> 12:58.226
Flarg!

12:59.320 --> 13:01.468
Fla-a-arg!

13:04.069 --> 13:05.150
[yells]

13:05.757 --> 13:07.288
And flarg.

13:11.398 --> 13:14.835
[crying out]

13:15.273 --> 13:17.093
Yes, I know it is painful,

13:17.203 --> 13:20.749
but imagine my pain if I were
to damage your precious gem

13:20.819 --> 13:23.253
while extracting it.
[explosion]

13:23.514 --> 13:26.296
[gasps] Intruders? [explosion]

13:30.843 --> 13:33.835
I said "distract,"
not "destroy."

13:33.983 --> 13:36.992
Being destroyed is distracting.
[laughing]

13:42.046 --> 13:43.265
Fools!

13:43.429 --> 13:46.042
But if they want
my collection so badly,

13:46.280 --> 13:48.577
who am I to deny them?

13:53.217 --> 13:54.607
[chittering]

13:54.919 --> 13:56.389
Uhh...

13:58.469 --> 13:59.970
What is that thing?

14:00.081 --> 14:02.167
Drax will go ask it.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.263
I am Groot?

14:05.830 --> 14:07.297
[panting]

14:10.060 --> 14:11.503
[chittering]

14:12.192 --> 14:16.013
Stay on that side of the glass,
if you know what's good for you.

14:18.377 --> 14:19.377
Adam!

14:19.443 --> 14:21.372
You!
[grunts]

14:21.482 --> 14:24.536
[machine powering down]
Are you all right?

14:24.716 --> 14:26.716
[groans]

14:30.693 --> 14:33.089
That the best you got,
Collector?

14:33.156 --> 14:34.786
[chittering]

14:34.951 --> 14:37.394
I'm gonna go with "no."

14:42.676 --> 14:45.974
Seriously?
[chittering]

14:46.474 --> 14:48.672
[Quill on radio] Come on! Come on!
[Drax grunting]

14:48.739 --> 14:52.380
I am Groot! I am Groot!
I am Groot!

14:53.294 --> 14:55.865
Come on. We're gonna have to
fight our way off this ship.

14:56.036 --> 14:57.547
I will not fight.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.777
You... Ugh! Fine.

14:59.848 --> 15:01.952
I'll fight, you watch.
[chittering]

15:02.082 --> 15:03.559
Get back!

15:03.685 --> 15:05.188
[grunts]

15:05.707 --> 15:07.626
Perhaps combat is
not always the answer.

15:07.693 --> 15:10.460
Yeah, I could see
that was working well for you.

15:10.527 --> 15:11.494
[screeches]

15:11.561 --> 15:13.763
[grunting]

15:16.559 --> 15:18.443
[grunts] My blade! [clangs]

15:18.518 --> 15:19.864
Adam!

15:20.028 --> 15:22.020
I sense pain here.

15:22.192 --> 15:23.989
There's a name
for that kind of pain.

15:24.426 --> 15:25.997
It's called hunger!

15:26.185 --> 15:28.145
[screeches]

15:31.765 --> 15:34.534
[growling]

15:38.298 --> 15:40.693
[Quill on radio] Drax, Groot,
how's it going out there?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.111
[grunts]
I have suffered worse.

15:43.274 --> 15:44.790
I am Groot!

15:45.399 --> 15:46.676
Okay. Cool.

15:46.845 --> 15:50.400
Speaking of which,
stay clear of the exhausts.

15:59.443 --> 16:01.244
[straining]

16:05.802 --> 16:07.302
Drax, give him a nudge.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.841
[grunts]

16:09.067 --> 16:10.935
[yells]
[crackling]

16:17.130 --> 16:19.700
[gasps]
Hmph!

16:20.778 --> 16:23.804
I was guaranteed
there would be no resistance.

16:25.048 --> 16:27.929
[grunting]

16:29.257 --> 16:31.691
I'm using the creature's
anger against it.

16:31.749 --> 16:33.819
It will wear itself out soon!

16:34.220 --> 16:36.156
[grunting]

16:36.214 --> 16:37.315
[groans]

16:37.999 --> 16:40.663
Not soon enough.
[chittering]

16:40.933 --> 16:42.034
Adam...

16:43.587 --> 16:46.022
[Warlock roaring]
[blow lands]

16:49.365 --> 16:50.799
[growls]

16:55.605 --> 16:57.172
You...

17:00.044 --> 17:01.845
[screeching]

17:01.903 --> 17:03.838
evil...

17:05.616 --> 17:08.405
monster!

17:11.218 --> 17:16.030
Speed, strength, surprise.
I... I think you got it.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.761
[panting] This would be where
you get these things off me,

17:18.819 --> 17:21.241
- and we get outta here.
- [Collector] No.

17:21.616 --> 17:25.528
This would be where I collect
your heads for my trophy room.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.882
[crying out]

17:34.138 --> 17:36.153
[yells]

17:41.601 --> 17:43.068
[grunts]

17:43.648 --> 17:45.383
[screaming]

17:45.450 --> 17:48.385
Wait! Did I say your heads?
I meant your head shots.

17:48.718 --> 17:50.715
As in photos, for autographs.

17:50.773 --> 17:54.093
- Please do not hurt me.
- Adam, what are you doing?

17:54.289 --> 17:56.304
[grunting]

17:56.398 --> 18:00.834
Just what you taught me.
I'm destroying him physically.

18:01.899 --> 18:03.233
[machine powering up]

18:05.305 --> 18:07.375
[screaming]

18:07.585 --> 18:09.546
Adam, listen to me.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.905
You've obviously found
your inner warrior.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.929
But you have to remember
why I fight.

18:15.116 --> 18:17.856
Thanos took my pacifism
but not my compassion.

18:17.914 --> 18:20.327
That's why I turned on him.

18:20.562 --> 18:23.265
I fight, but not from hate.

18:23.796 --> 18:26.116
I fight for my friends!

18:26.679 --> 18:28.593
That was going
to be lesson two.

18:28.776 --> 18:29.909
[grunts softly]

18:32.254 --> 18:34.555
[machine powering down]

18:35.132 --> 18:36.733
[groans]

18:38.476 --> 18:40.226
You should rethink that order.

18:40.702 --> 18:43.812
[sighs]
Wait. What are you doing?

18:44.702 --> 18:47.460
Compassion. That was
your whole point, right?

18:47.810 --> 18:50.606
But not before...
[grunts, groans]

18:51.343 --> 18:55.046
I suggest you cover irredeemable
villains in lesson three.

18:55.233 --> 18:58.121
Not that you'll live to teach it.
[grunts]

18:58.188 --> 19:01.057
[weapon clangs]
[groans]

19:03.296 --> 19:07.194
See, now, collecting without
permission is called stealing.

19:07.304 --> 19:09.866
And stealing's my job.

19:16.085 --> 19:19.476
I swear I gotta do
everything myself! Huh!

19:20.843 --> 19:22.645
Forget something?

19:25.407 --> 19:28.349
[chittering]
Huh?

19:28.579 --> 19:30.154
[whimpering]

19:30.455 --> 19:33.166
Well, love to stick around,
but, uh...

19:33.580 --> 19:34.764
[whimpering continues]

19:34.822 --> 19:35.968
[screeching]

19:36.026 --> 19:38.369
Uh, maybe I will
stick around.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.049
[laughs]
This could be fun.

19:40.148 --> 19:43.084
Ow! Killjoy.
[beeps]

19:49.342 --> 19:51.243
[sparks from power tool
crackling]

19:55.532 --> 19:58.986
Hmm. All singing
from same page now?

19:59.496 --> 20:00.661
Thanks to you.

20:00.838 --> 20:02.658
And to you,
for teaching me

20:02.716 --> 20:05.721
not just how to fight,
but when and why.

20:06.162 --> 20:09.002
I'm sorry to have put us
in danger while it all sunk in.

20:09.369 --> 20:11.650
Too compassionate's
definitely a problem.

20:11.708 --> 20:15.049
But so's too angry, and when
you went there, I saw me.

20:15.537 --> 20:18.755
Part of me, anyway.
Not my favorite part.

20:18.945 --> 20:21.449
Everything in balance, da?

20:21.705 --> 20:25.083
I always denied there was any
wisdom in my people's pacifism.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.411
You needed to,
to survive.

20:28.159 --> 20:30.060
Maybe.
But right now,

20:30.118 --> 20:32.216
I'm missing the memory
of them more than ever.

20:32.643 --> 20:35.364
You know, some memories
we erase ourselves

20:35.422 --> 20:37.435
because they make us
feel vulnerable.

20:37.516 --> 20:40.458
Those ones
are never truly lost.

20:46.199 --> 20:49.034
[giggling]

20:58.736 --> 21:00.087
[sighs]

21:07.299 --> 21:08.566
[cries softly]

21:08.704 --> 21:10.552
[Quill]
Hey, is that a...

21:12.616 --> 21:15.744
[all]
Uhhh...

21:17.251 --> 21:18.408
What?

21:18.482 --> 21:21.033
We saw nothing.
And by "nothing,"

21:21.091 --> 21:25.744
baldy means the most dangerous
woman in the galaxy weeping like...

21:26.201 --> 21:27.447
[yells]

21:27.804 --> 21:28.915
[thud]

21:30.148 --> 21:32.298
[coughs]
Scratch that.

21:32.497 --> 21:35.689
Didn't see a thing. [groans]
