WEBVTT

00:12.750 --> 00:15.333
Stole the woman
of my dreams, Dave.

00:15.417 --> 00:17.375
I ever tell you that, Brenda?

00:17.458 --> 00:19.709
What? What's it matter now?
I said it.

00:19.792 --> 00:23.834
Anyway, Brenda and Dave giving
the rest of us idiots hope.

00:31.375 --> 00:33.417
Say something nice?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.000
David turned me down

00:35.083 --> 00:37.917
even after I took
my clothes off.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.750
But we've all
grown up, right?

00:40.834 --> 00:43.709
(male #1)
'Bren, your turn.'

00:43.792 --> 00:46.625
'Say something to you and Dave
30 years from now'

00:46.709 --> 00:48.333
'when you're old
and shriveled'

00:48.417 --> 00:50.959
'and watching this on your
craftmatic adjustable bed.'

00:54.875 --> 00:59.166
Hey, you and me,
um, 30 years from now.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.792
I guess..

01:00.875 --> 01:02.291
...maybe I'll think I'm
crazy
for saying this

01:02.375 --> 01:06.000
but I can't wait
until we're old...and happy

01:06.083 --> 01:08.208
and grandchildren
piled around us

01:08.291 --> 01:09.458
on our craftmatic
adjustable bed.

01:09.542 --> 01:10.750
(man #2)
'Listen up!'

01:12.542 --> 01:14.959
Who's the Einstein
that left their lights on?

01:15.041 --> 01:18.000
"Volvo, G-3-D-7-L-3-B."

01:18.083 --> 01:21.625
Oh, that's me.
Uh, babe.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.083
Give me your keys.
I'll go.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.834
I forgot something
in the car anyway.

01:24.917 --> 01:25.792
A surprise.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.083
Ugh, no more surprises,
please.

01:27.166 --> 01:28.667
No, this is a good one

01:28.750 --> 01:31.750
so you don't have to tell
the proposal story all
night.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.625
As long as you're not
running out on me.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.792
Prevailing wisdom
is that I don't deserve you.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.917
You don't.

01:52.875 --> 01:55.834
Brenda!
Brenda!

01:55.917 --> 01:57.000
There's no way
she'd just disappear.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.542
She probably went
to get something.

01:58.625 --> 02:00.583
If she went somewhere,
she would have taken her car.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.667
Brenda!

02:08.291 --> 02:10.250
What is that?

02:15.166 --> 02:16.875
No.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.417
I really don't remember

02:40.500 --> 02:44.041
but if you say I was there,
I guess I was.

02:44.125 --> 02:46.166
'Her fiance must be
real broken up.'

02:47.125 --> 02:49.208
Bet he misses her.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.000
Ted Huffard,
deputy sheriff

02:52.083 --> 02:53.709
'in Ripley,
West Virginia, sent it.'

02:53.792 --> 02:54.959
Pulled him over
for an illegal
turn

02:55.041 --> 02:56.375
finds the plates in the trunk.

02:56.458 --> 02:57.625
Car is not only stolen.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.792
- It's in felony vehicle
status.
- What for?

02:59.875 --> 03:03.792
Seen leaving a restaurant
parking lot in Chestnut Hill

03:03.875 --> 03:05.875
the night Brenda MacDowell
was abducted.

03:05.959 --> 03:08.250
'August 12, '07.'

03:08.333 --> 03:10.583
Car's a late-model
gold Honda Accord.

03:10.667 --> 03:11.875
Driver's side dent.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.125
Reported stolen
in Grays Ferry

03:13.208 --> 03:14.959
two days before
Brenda disappears.

03:15.041 --> 03:16.917
(Rush)
'Hmm, the night of
her engagement party'

03:17.000 --> 03:18.500
'a guy lures her
out of the restaurant'

03:18.583 --> 03:20.375
by turning
on her Volvo's headlights

03:20.458 --> 03:22.959
then calls the plates
into the restaurant.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.083
Smart trick.

03:24.166 --> 03:25.417
(Stillman)
'Presumed homicide.'

03:25.500 --> 03:27.583
'Investigation never
turned up the body.'

03:27.667 --> 03:29.250
Looks like a happy girl.

03:29.333 --> 03:32.166
There's a ribbon bouquet found
at the scene, lots of blood.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.208
No matches,
not even hers.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.125
- Till now.
- DNA matched this guy's?

03:36.208 --> 03:37.333
Huffard offered him
a cigarette

03:37.417 --> 03:39.125
got a match
off his saliva.

03:39.208 --> 03:40.208
(Rush)
'His blood.'

03:40.291 --> 03:41.709
So she fought back.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.375
Lot of good
it did her.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.125
This nutjob got a name?

03:45.208 --> 03:46.792
(Stillman)
'He calls himself John Smith'

03:46.875 --> 03:48.000
'but the number
on the Florida license'

03:48.083 --> 03:49.458
he was carrying
doesn't exist.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.750
No match on the prints
and DNA's not in CODIS.

03:51.834 --> 03:52.834
More like a John Doe.

03:52.917 --> 03:54.417
We need a body
and a confession

03:54.500 --> 03:56.250
before he gets
to Philly and lawyers up.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.417
Tonight.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.125
Who's gonna take the ride?

03:59.208 --> 04:01.917
Toni's
making
casserole.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.041
You gonna play the
casserole card
again?

04:04.125 --> 04:05.333
I'll go.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.500
I'm gonna need you on call,
Nick, in case we get anything.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.625
Chasing a bag
of bones, boss.

04:16.709 --> 04:19.125
Tell that to her fiance.

04:22.041 --> 04:23.542
You found Brenda?

04:26.250 --> 04:28.166
(Stillman)
'You know him?'

04:28.250 --> 04:30.333
No, if I did,
I'd kill him myself.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.166
Could be the guy
who reads your meter

04:32.250 --> 04:34.250
or the grocery store clerk.

04:38.208 --> 04:40.000
I've never seen him
before in my life.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.667
Well, thanks
for taking a look, David.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.083
We'll keep you posted.

04:48.917 --> 04:52.000
You know, everyone keeps
telling
me I need to, uh, move on.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.375
But how am I supposed
to do that?

04:57.625 --> 04:59.542
I need you
to find her this time.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.208
I need to bury her.

05:02.542 --> 05:04.417
See what we can do.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.709
(Stillman)
'I'll walk you out.'

05:12.959 --> 05:14.166
Take a ride?

05:15.166 --> 05:17.750
West Virginia
is more than a ride.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.041
You're talking
all night here.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.875
You got something
else going on?

05:21.959 --> 05:24.583
Was planning on
washing my hair, actually.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.250
Still having
trouble sleeping, huh?

05:29.834 --> 05:30.959
Look, you coming or not?

05:31.041 --> 05:33.417
- Yeah. But I'm driving.
- Then let's go.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.083
John Smith's waiting.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.166
Folks drive all
night,
did you?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.583
It was about four hours.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.625
From Philly,
that's flying.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.625
Well, my partner's got
a lead foot.

06:19.709 --> 06:21.709
Judge took care
of the extradition
papers.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.667
Hope y'all have better luck
getting a body out of him.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.041
Plan on taking our time
getting back.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.375
Give us a chance
to talk.

06:28.458 --> 06:29.875
He's polite, good manners.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.709
Wouldn't have picked him
out of a crowd.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.792
He was going nuts in his cell,
so I put him over here instead.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.375
'Get up now, John.'

06:36.458 --> 06:39.625
'Detectives Rush and Valens
taking you back to Philly.'

06:42.375 --> 06:44.458
- Man said get up.
- 'Sorry.'

06:44.542 --> 06:47.750
Alright. Things make
it hard to stand.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.125
Not meant to be comfortable.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.500
I never met
a female
detective.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.000
Certainly hope they appreciate
everything you've given up

06:56.083 --> 06:57.792
to do what you do.

07:15.917 --> 07:20.500
You got a real name or we part
of this John Smith charade?

07:20.583 --> 07:21.834
You want to talk to me.

07:21.917 --> 07:25.208
Blood, DNA. Already got enough
to put you away.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.709
Don't need you saying jack.

07:28.208 --> 07:29.875
Then why are we taking
the scenic route

07:29.959 --> 07:31.917
unless you want
to find her body?

07:33.625 --> 07:38.000
Need to give you a chance
to
help yourself, cooperate.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.250
We'll talk to the DA,
see what we can do.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.625
You a Kenso? You sound like
you're from Kensington.

07:43.709 --> 07:45.208
Port Richmond maybe.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.125
I'll ask the questions.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.959
Kensington.

07:51.458 --> 07:54.542
There's no place to stop
for food this way, bathroom.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.834
Guess you'll have
to hold it.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.792
Your perfume.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.583
It's flowery.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.875
Not what I'd expect
from someone in your position.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.959
Don't wear it.

08:08.041 --> 08:10.166
Cologne then.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.625
It's aftershave.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.166
There's nothing flowery
about it.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.875
So how'd you do it, John?

08:18.959 --> 08:21.417
Taking a child's one thing.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.750
Woman like Brenda
would have screamed.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.417
You see the world
in a certain way

08:25.500 --> 08:28.333
the way you want it to work.
You don't know that.

08:28.417 --> 08:32.041
Are you saying you two
had some kind of relationship?

08:32.125 --> 08:34.875
I'm saying sometimes the pieces
of the puzzle don't fit.

08:34.959 --> 08:36.417
'Cause she fought back.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.166
'Your blood at the scene.'

08:38.250 --> 08:41.583
You get your ass handed to you
by a woman, Johnny boy?

08:41.667 --> 08:44.083
I'm not the guy you look at
and think rapist.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.583
'I'm more like the guy you
see
at the dentist's office.'

08:47.667 --> 08:48.834
No reason to fight me.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.834
So you wanted
to be important, stand out.

08:53.917 --> 08:56.250
'Cause women like Brenda
don't notice losers like
you.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.166
A well-mannered
woman like that?

08:59.667 --> 09:03.125
She notices.
All you got to do is ask.

09:17.542 --> 09:20.083
Excuse me.
Sorry, over here.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.709
I pick up take-out
for my wife.

09:22.792 --> 09:25.458
She's six months along,
craving chili fries

09:25.542 --> 09:27.083
and my car won't start.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.625
Murphy's Law, right?

09:28.709 --> 09:31.709
Uh, do you mind if I use
your cell phone to call AAA?

09:31.792 --> 09:32.875
Mine just died.

09:34.709 --> 09:36.083
You can use
the phone
inside.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.917
Hey, Brenda MacDowell, right?
I'm John Smith.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.917
We ran the marathon
for Hart-Fitzgerald together.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.917
You're at the firm?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.834
A paralegal,
getting my degree at night.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.875
Right.
John Smith.

09:49.959 --> 09:52.458
Hey, don't worry about it.
I work in the basement.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.667
You're in litigation,
right?

09:54.750 --> 09:58.542
Didn't think that
WestTech case was winnable.

09:58.625 --> 09:59.917
Thanks.

10:04.166 --> 10:07.000
If you could, um,
you know, hurry.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.291
That party in
there
is for me.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.000
- I'm getting married.
- Oh, congratulations.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.834
Best decision
I ever made.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.959
Hi, John Smith again.
We got cut off.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.834
Right, '96 Accord.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.083
Do you mind giving it a try?

10:21.166 --> 10:23.083
I might have done
the trick there.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.250
Hey.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.583
Hey, it worked.

10:40.667 --> 10:43.208
Real stunt you pulled there
at the end of the marathon.

10:43.291 --> 10:46.583
Never seen a girl
so pleased with her damn self.

11:02.959 --> 11:05.542
Just gave us abduction,
brain trust.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.583
Well, don't say
I never gave you anything.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.375
(Rush)
'Oh, impressive, John.'

11:10.458 --> 11:11.959
'Any ape can hold a gun.'

11:12.041 --> 11:13.583
You talked to her,
roped her in.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.083
You got her
when she least expected it

11:15.166 --> 11:18.083
in some parking lot
going to turn off her
lights.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.083
(Rush)
'She saw the world
a certain way.'

11:20.166 --> 11:21.667
The way she wanted it
to work.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.250
Makes a person
weak, vulnerable.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.291
And that's how you work.
Finding their soft spot.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.291
Kind of like you, detective.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.417
Well, read me well.
Just like you read her.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.041
- You a runner, John?
- No.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.291
What were you doing
at the marathon?

11:39.375 --> 11:41.542
Not a paralegal,
are you, John?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.166
(Jefferies)
'No John Smith
at your fiance's law firm'

11:52.250 --> 11:54.959
nobody who matches
his description.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.458
We think he was stalking her.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.750
Following her routine,
knew where she worked.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.959
We ran the marathon
together last year.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.542
You see anyone suspicious?

12:04.625 --> 12:07.417
Showing a real interest
in Brenda there?

12:07.500 --> 12:09.000
No.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.834
I just had
eyes
for her.

12:12.917 --> 12:16.208
(Brenda)
'Oh! We did it!'

12:16.291 --> 12:18.959
(David)
'We...did it.'

12:19.041 --> 12:22.333
[panting]
What's our time?

12:22.417 --> 12:25.792
(David)
'Four hours, 23 minutes,
and 13 seconds.'

12:25.875 --> 12:28.291
(Brenda)
'So, if I ever had any
doubts'

12:29.667 --> 12:33.083
about what we're capable
of doing...together..

12:35.166 --> 12:37.834
...I mean, everything
in front of us.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.792
(David)
'Are you..
Bren!'

12:44.583 --> 12:46.041
Will you..

12:46.125 --> 12:47.500
'...marry me?'

12:47.583 --> 12:50.333
(David)
'I-I'm supposed to ask!
I was gonna ask you!'

12:50.417 --> 12:54.208
- So, is that--
- 'Yes! Yes! Let's get
married!'

12:56.417 --> 12:58.500
We'll have
to check that footage, David.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.667
Give you a few minutes.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.750
You meet a lot of people
like me, don't you?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.208
Does it ever get any easier?

13:15.959 --> 13:18.625
I'll be outside
when you're finished.

13:24.291 --> 13:28.041
(female #1)
'You can do it, Brenda.
That's it!'

13:31.291 --> 13:33.125
(male #2)
'You okay, honey?
You alright?'

13:33.208 --> 13:34.458
I'm okay.

13:34.542 --> 13:35.709
'You scraped your knee.'

13:35.792 --> 13:37.500
(Brenda)
'I can do it, daddy.'

13:37.583 --> 13:38.709
I wanna try again.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.959
'Go, sweetie!
Go, Brenda!'

13:49.041 --> 13:53.208
Never let go, do they?
Ones that don't get the
bodies.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.750
Vera found the owner
of that gold Honda.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.667
Okay.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.250
Draggin' my ass out of bed
in middle of the night

14:02.333 --> 14:03.583
and for what?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.792
I reported that car stolen
eight months ago.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.500
We need your help
finding
the man who took it.

14:08.583 --> 14:09.792
Have you seen this guy?

14:09.875 --> 14:12.458
He the SOB
who got me my parking tickets?

14:12.542 --> 14:15.041
- Parking tickets?
- Four of 'em since it's
stolen.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.458
Newark, all of 'em.

14:18.542 --> 14:21.542
Parking guy got the VIN number
through the windshield.

14:21.625 --> 14:22.792
Same cross streets
on all four.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.208
He's going back
to the same
place

14:24.291 --> 14:26.250
staying long
enough
to get ticketed.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.041
- His neighborhood?
- Or where he dumped the body.

14:29.125 --> 14:30.709
Thank you, Mrs. Phillips.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.875
What about my damn car?

14:37.875 --> 14:39.542
Don't know him.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.792
(Vera)
'Great idea, Miller,
knocking on doors'

14:45.875 --> 14:47.250
'in the middle of the night.'

14:47.333 --> 14:49.709
None of these mopes
has seen the guy.

14:49.792 --> 14:54.625
Memory serves, it was
your great idea, Mr.
Casserole.

14:54.709 --> 14:57.542
Philly PD.
You seen this guy?

14:57.625 --> 15:00.500
Live over there, the brown
door,
about a year back.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.291
- Only cracker on the block.
- This cracker got a name?

15:03.375 --> 15:06.917
Keep to himself.
Drove an old gold thing.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.625
- A Honda?
- Sound about right.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.375
PPD! Open up!

15:16.583 --> 15:18.458
Do you hear something inside?

15:18.542 --> 15:21.208
I don't hear nothin'.

15:21.291 --> 15:22.583
Neither do I.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.750
What the hell?

15:39.291 --> 15:40.458
I think we found her.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.834
The smell's coming
from down here.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.208
(Vera)
'What the hell?'

16:14.959 --> 16:17.542
The place belongs
to a John Smith.

16:18.458 --> 16:21.291
Bought it with $6,000 cash.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.917
John Smith? He buys
a house with an
alias?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.208
I find a buyer in
this neighborhood

16:25.291 --> 16:26.667
I ain't asking
questions
either.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.750
Yeah, he's ready for us.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.083
Couldn't hide her forever.

16:45.166 --> 16:48.250
Toilet, sink.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.083
You could keep someone alive
for however long you wanted.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.291
(Miller)
'How long?'

16:52.375 --> 16:54.000
Long enough to do this.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.917
Place is like a POW camp.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.208
'Your mind on the wall,
all you got.'

17:04.291 --> 17:06.542
Must have taken her weeks.
Months.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.208
She didn't just die
in this dungeon.

17:09.291 --> 17:11.375
She lived here, too.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.041
We found her, John.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.375
- Game over.
- You found Brenda?

17:27.458 --> 17:28.750
You kept her in that
Newark dungeon for months

17:28.834 --> 17:30.291
before you killed her.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.583
What the hell were you
doing with her all that time?

17:32.667 --> 17:36.542
Newark?
You mind opening a window?

17:36.625 --> 17:39.375
- Yeah, I do mind.
- I can't breathe.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.792
You didn't like your cell
back in West Virginia.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.291
Don't like
to feel crowded.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.125
You spend time in lockup,
John?

17:49.208 --> 17:50.375
'You showing her
what it feels like?'

17:50.458 --> 17:51.500
No.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.500
'Cause that's
where you're headed.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.625
'Rest of your days
in a cage.'

17:57.375 --> 17:59.250
Yeah, pretty girl, Brenda.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.750
Yes, she was.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.959
Oh, so what?

18:04.041 --> 18:07.583
You can't pitch a tent,
Johnny?
That your problem?

18:07.667 --> 18:10.166
- You think it was about sex?
- Power.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.750
You can't imagine a man wants
to keep a woman around

18:12.834 --> 18:14.250
without hurting her,
can you?

18:14.333 --> 18:16.667
Not locked
in his basement homes.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.000
If I wanted to have sex,
I could pay for women

18:19.083 --> 18:20.709
off the streets,
in bars.

18:20.792 --> 18:25.125
Common as road kill,
filth like that.

18:25.208 --> 18:27.208
Nice tail on this one.

18:29.458 --> 18:31.875
Sure you didn't get
a piece of that?

18:31.959 --> 18:33.625
You get a piece of that?

18:33.709 --> 18:37.208
Bet you think about it,
time to time?

18:39.375 --> 18:40.625
Oh, if you weren't having
your way with her

18:40.709 --> 18:42.667
why did you keep her
for so long?

18:42.750 --> 18:45.250
Tell me something first.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.542
What gets you out of bed
in the morning?

18:48.625 --> 18:51.458
Everyone's got something
they hold onto.

18:51.542 --> 18:53.000
Keeps them tethered
to this world.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.208
'No wedding ring.'

18:56.291 --> 18:58.000
A boyfriend, perhaps?

18:59.166 --> 19:01.208
So what was Brenda
holding on to?

19:01.291 --> 19:02.709
Love.

19:10.959 --> 19:13.250
What are you doing?

19:13.333 --> 19:14.375
Where am I?

19:14.458 --> 19:16.417
You were sleeping.
You woke up.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.166
You stay away from me!

19:18.250 --> 19:19.333
David!

19:19.417 --> 19:21.041
David!

19:21.125 --> 19:22.709
David's not here.

19:26.041 --> 19:29.166
Help!
Someone help me!

19:29.250 --> 19:30.750
'Help!'

19:30.834 --> 19:33.125
No one can hear you.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.750
Who are you?

19:34.834 --> 19:37.083
What do you want?

19:37.166 --> 19:38.458
Nothing.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.458
They will find me.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.959
They won't stop
until they find
me.

19:44.041 --> 19:46.625
They might be looking
for you

19:46.709 --> 19:48.542
but no one's
looking for me.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.000
How long
do you think it'll be

19:53.083 --> 19:56.417
till there's a red Mustang
in his driveway?

19:58.166 --> 19:59.917
Everyone's gonna
tell him to move on.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.709
That's a guarantee.

20:02.792 --> 20:05.750
How do you know
about David's
ex-girlfriend?

20:05.834 --> 20:09.041
- 'Who are you?'
- That look on your face.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.041
It's just like
little Brenda on her bike.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.041
Red lips.
Red knee.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.709
Any other kid
would've run to mommy.

20:20.792 --> 20:22.917
Not you.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.458
Determined.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.709
'Always.'

20:27.125 --> 20:29.542
- You don't know me.
- I know you.

20:31.709 --> 20:35.458
I'm just waiting
for you to catch up.

20:52.875 --> 20:56.417
That get you off, huh?
The mind games?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.458
(John)
'I told you once,
it wasn't about sex.'

20:58.542 --> 21:01.542
You wanted something.
Drive her nuts?

21:01.625 --> 21:03.000
The chicken scrawl
on the walls.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.083
She tried to keep her sanity
for a while

21:05.166 --> 21:06.709
by marking off the days..

21:07.875 --> 21:09.792
'...but there was
no point to that.'

21:11.083 --> 21:13.166
Little Brenda.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.166
You knew her
when she was a kid?

21:16.250 --> 21:19.792
You're the detective.
Figure it out.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.208
He said she was
marking off the
days.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.125
No windows, no lights
coming into that room.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.625
So how did she know
what day it was?

21:41.458 --> 21:43.041
Will, it's Rush.

21:43.125 --> 21:44.417
Brenda on her bike.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.375
A fall, um,
skinned knee maybe?

21:47.458 --> 21:50.417
That mean
something to you?

21:50.500 --> 21:51.959
(Jefferies)
'The part of the movie
where Brenda learned'

21:52.041 --> 21:54.458
'to ride her bike,
skinned her knee.'

21:54.542 --> 21:56.250
'He must have seen it.'

21:56.333 --> 21:57.834
Did you show it
to anyone else?

21:57.917 --> 21:59.041
No.

22:00.792 --> 22:02.917
Brenda was gonna show
it at the engagement party.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.291
Uh, it was still in her car
when she disappeared.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.750
She make it herself or
give it to one of those
places

22:07.834 --> 22:09.583
that edits your
home video for
you?

22:09.667 --> 22:11.875
She gave it to, uh,
some company.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.166
She got the movies
from our families

22:14.250 --> 22:16.000
and gave them to some place.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.083
She mention the name?

22:18.166 --> 22:19.750
Your Best Angle.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.583
Something like that?
It was, uh..

22:21.667 --> 22:22.834
It was near her office.

22:22.917 --> 22:26.834
John, just talked to
the owner of Best Angle.

22:26.917 --> 22:28.417
Place Brenda brought
her home videos?

22:28.500 --> 22:29.917
(Vera)
'Turns out John Smith
worked there.'

22:30.000 --> 22:31.375
Owner says
he was their best editor.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.166
Worked there for a
year,
paid in cash

22:33.250 --> 22:34.625
before quitting
four days ago.

22:34.709 --> 22:36.417
Owner says he's on his way
to Marion, Illinois

22:36.500 --> 22:37.417
for his next gig.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.667
Till his bad turn in Ripley.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.625
Four previous employers
since '02.

22:40.709 --> 22:43.375
Life Videos in Newark,
Edit Right in Detroit.

22:43.458 --> 22:44.709
Two more in Atlanta and Queens.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.333
- All editing houses.
- So?

22:46.417 --> 22:49.417
One client from each of his
jobs
matches a missing woman

22:49.500 --> 22:51.250
from the same city,
same year.

22:51.333 --> 22:54.083
Boss, ME's preliminary
report is back.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.417
Dental records
on the Newark body

22:55.500 --> 22:57.417
didn't match
Brenda MacDowell's.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.208
It wasn't Brenda
in that basement.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.333
Newark?

23:01.417 --> 23:02.500
'Colleen Legarth.'

23:02.583 --> 23:04.500
Missing since November '06.

23:04.583 --> 23:05.834
They find a cause of death?

23:05.917 --> 23:08.583
No strangulation, no
ligatures,
no broken bones.

23:08.667 --> 23:09.959
'Tox report's clean.'

23:10.041 --> 23:11.291
How's he killing them?

23:12.500 --> 23:14.333
- Five women.
- Five cities.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.375
Five basements.

23:16.458 --> 23:20.291
Let Lil and Scotty know. This
guy is not just a serial
killer.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.250
He's a collector.

23:40.667 --> 23:42.375
Notice you never
use your signal.

23:43.667 --> 23:45.208
Cops drive however they want.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.417
Gotta have some perks
with the job.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.625
Now, body in Newark
wasn't Brenda.

23:51.625 --> 23:52.667
You lied.

23:52.750 --> 23:55.166
I never lied.
You made an assumption.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.000
(John)
'The way you wanted
to see it.'

23:57.083 --> 23:59.500
Four other women locked up
out there somewhere.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.959
You wanted us to know
about 'em. Why?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.333
How did you kill them?

24:03.417 --> 24:04.917
Your fancy labs
can't tell you?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.542
You watched their tapes,
picked them for a reason.

24:08.625 --> 24:10.375
- Somethin' you liked about
'em.
- Or hated.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.667
You still haven't told me what
gets you out of bed, detective.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.041
Tell me where Brenda is

24:14.125 --> 24:15.667
and I'll make sure
you don't get the needle.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.500
'Is it the rush you get
from seeing dead people?'

24:18.583 --> 24:21.041
Has to be a reason
you became a homicide cop.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.959
What happens to you?
When you kill 'em?

24:25.083 --> 24:28.083
Death's the only thing
that's real.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.875
It's the purest thing
you'll ever see.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.291
Oh, you God now?

24:31.375 --> 24:36.250
Question is, what's that
rush covering for you?

24:36.333 --> 24:37.583
You seem to know
a lot about it.

24:37.667 --> 24:38.959
Why don't you tell us?

24:39.041 --> 24:42.291
When there's one thing
you hold onto

24:42.375 --> 24:44.750
it takes on
a special significance.

24:44.834 --> 24:46.250
'And when that's
taken away'

24:47.125 --> 24:49.417
you're left with nothing.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.500
<i>(John)</i>
<i>Like that woman from Newark.</i>
<i>Colleen.</i>

25:20.083 --> 25:21.583
(Colleen on TV)
'What did you say?'

25:21.667 --> 25:23.291
'What'd you say?'

25:26.625 --> 25:27.834
'That's right.'

25:27.917 --> 25:29.750
'I'm right here.'

25:32.333 --> 25:34.834
'Ah, look at that smile.'

25:34.917 --> 25:37.375
'Honey!
She just smiled at me!'

25:37.458 --> 25:39.750
'She smiled!'

25:39.834 --> 25:41.333
'Look at you.'

25:41.417 --> 25:43.083
'Beautiful as the sun.'

25:48.000 --> 25:49.041
Please.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.375
Pretty little girl.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.959
Maybe she'd like it
here too, someday.

26:08.959 --> 26:11.500
Such fragile things
they hold onto.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.875
And when they're gone,
they just..

26:15.959 --> 26:17.792
...float away.

26:17.875 --> 26:20.458
- That's how you kill them?
- 'Kill them.'

26:20.542 --> 26:22.625
That's a funny way to put
it,
really.

26:22.709 --> 26:24.667
Talk about Brenda.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.333
You got nothin' to lose,
right?
Where'd you put her body?

26:26.417 --> 26:29.041
We've been talking
about that one all night.

26:29.125 --> 26:30.208
'It's boring.'

26:31.583 --> 26:34.041
But not the end.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.166
Not how you crush her.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.667
(Rush)
'Now, you don't talk
about that.'

26:37.750 --> 26:38.875
Why not?

26:40.917 --> 26:44.000
(Valens)
'It takes a lot of
discipline'

26:44.083 --> 26:46.000
keeping a woman
locked up for months.

26:46.083 --> 26:47.667
No one hearing her screams.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.709
(Rush)
'Must be a reason
you got caught now.'

26:49.792 --> 26:53.583
And made that bad turn.
Meticulous guy like you.

26:53.667 --> 26:55.000
(Valens)
'Something rattled you.'

26:55.083 --> 26:57.166
- No. You're wrong.
- Got under your skin.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.375
For you to make
a mistake like that.

26:58.458 --> 27:00.083
I don't make mistakes!

27:02.250 --> 27:04.458
Brenda's still alive,
isn't she?

27:08.250 --> 27:10.542
You know, I think
I'm done talking.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.542
He left Philly four days ago.

27:13.625 --> 27:14.709
If she's still alive,
we don't have much time.

27:14.792 --> 27:15.834
Mapped out all the victims.

27:15.917 --> 27:17.083
Newark's the only city
where you have

27:17.166 --> 27:18.750
both the abduction site
and the dump site.

27:18.834 --> 27:20.417
(Jefferies)
'The abduction
took place here.'

27:20.500 --> 27:22.542
- Here's the basement.
- Less than a 20 minute
drive.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.875
(Stillman)
'He gets them inside before
the chloroform wears off.'

27:24.959 --> 27:26.583
He's finding basements
in poor neighborhoods

27:26.667 --> 27:28.333
where no one sees anything,
says anything.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.542
Here's the restaurant
where Brenda was abducted.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.291
Searching a
20 minute
radius

27:32.375 --> 27:34.375
three low income
neighborhoods fall
inside.

27:34.458 --> 27:36.000
Our contact at
the recorder's office

27:36.083 --> 27:37.709
is looking for properties
bought in cash

27:37.792 --> 27:39.417
for less than
ten grand by John Smith.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.500
I'll see how Miller is doing
on the videos.

27:54.291 --> 27:55.959
Got tech support
out of the bed

27:56.041 --> 27:58.834
downloaded the movies
John Smith made of his
victims.

27:58.917 --> 27:59.959
What's the common thread?

28:00.041 --> 28:03.583
We know that, we find Brenda.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.417
We dreamed about this day
for so long.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.250
And here you are.

28:15.417 --> 28:17.792
Different classes,
different ages.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.208
'Some had families,
some didn't.'

28:20.291 --> 28:23.333
Only thing
in common is..

28:23.417 --> 28:25.458
...they all had something
to live for.

28:26.834 --> 28:30.917
Fiance, kid, God.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.083
A wide net there.

28:33.166 --> 28:34.333
Maybe not so wide.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.500
Uh, Monica had God.

28:39.583 --> 28:42.583
Colleen had her baby.
And Brenda had David.

28:44.583 --> 28:46.709
Chose women with something
to live for.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.291
(Rush)
'Someone they loved.'

28:48.375 --> 28:50.667
Not something
you'd know about.

28:50.750 --> 28:54.583
Must have driven you crazy.
All the things they had.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.291
Not you, though.

28:56.375 --> 28:59.417
I edited their sloppy lives
into something beautiful.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.208
I gave them a way
to believe the delusions

29:02.291 --> 29:03.500
they were
hanging onto.

29:03.583 --> 29:05.125
Delusions? Look who's talking.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.208
What's on those videos
isn't who they are.

29:07.291 --> 29:08.458
It's a charade.

29:08.542 --> 29:10.125
To give their lives meaning.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.166
Like the job gives
your life meaning.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.333
I've had it with your BS.
Where's Brenda?

29:15.417 --> 29:17.917
Don't pretend you don't know
what I mean, detective.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.542
Now, where'd you put
her body, you freak?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.166
No, I-I-I do.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.083
I know what you mean.

29:25.166 --> 29:27.875
Who are you
when it's taken away?

29:27.959 --> 29:30.083
The job.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.500
'No one.'

29:32.583 --> 29:34.458
Like them.

29:34.542 --> 29:37.834
- Even the one who had God.
- 'Monica.'

29:37.917 --> 29:40.667
- The singer.
- She gave up the easiest.

29:40.750 --> 29:43.417
She couldn't understand
how God could leave her

29:43.500 --> 29:45.000
in that room so alone.

29:46.709 --> 29:49.667
<i>(John)</i>
<i>I saw it in her eyes.</i>

29:49.750 --> 29:53.000
<i>The moment she realized</i>
<i>there was no God.</i>

29:53.083 --> 29:54.458
<i>That if God was anything</i>

29:54.542 --> 29:56.625
<i>he was the greatest</i>
<i>con man of all.</i>

30:07.625 --> 30:12.625
Once hope is gone,
dying is just a formality.

30:13.875 --> 30:16.375
You sealed her in there alive?

30:16.458 --> 30:18.166
First, I took the door
off its hinges.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.875
She was free
to go, run.

30:21.959 --> 30:23.417
I wouldn't have stopped her.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.875
But she wasn't looking
for a way out anymore.

30:26.959 --> 30:31.709
Sounds like
you're...familiar,
detective.

30:31.792 --> 30:32.709
Son of a..

30:39.166 --> 30:40.917
Where's Brenda?
Hmm?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.583
- Where is she?
- 'Scotty.'

30:44.625 --> 30:45.625
Son of a bitch.

30:45.709 --> 30:47.583
- Scotty!
- Hmm?

30:47.667 --> 30:49.250
Hey! Stop!

30:55.041 --> 30:56.333
She's here.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.041
In these woods.

31:02.291 --> 31:05.125
A mile further,
there's a blinking yellow
light.

31:05.208 --> 31:07.709
'Path to the right,
heads into the woods.'

31:07.792 --> 31:10.000
A quarter mile in,
there's a clearing.

31:13.083 --> 31:14.417
Put him in the car.

31:27.834 --> 31:29.041
I'll drive.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.583
I'm going in.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.083
The guy's got
an endgame,
Lil.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.875
Who knows what he's got
waiting in those woods?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.291
- We're running out of time.
- But we know his pattern.

32:43.375 --> 32:44.875
Houses, basements.
Not woods.

32:44.959 --> 32:47.667
What if we're wrong
and she's in there right now?

32:51.458 --> 32:53.291
No service.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.625
Well, we don't have time
to wait for backup.

32:56.792 --> 32:59.417
We're armed. He's not.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.041
You ready to
pull
the trigger?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.375
Let's go.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.667
Try anything,
I'll blow your head
off.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.208
You get Lil or Scotty
on the line yet?

33:23.291 --> 33:25.041
Cell phone keeps
dumping to voice mail.

33:25.125 --> 33:26.625
Last time they called
was Waynesburg.

33:26.709 --> 33:28.917
Nothing between here
and there but lumber.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.208
- What the hell are they
doing?
- Going renegade.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.375
With a sociopath in custody.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.083
Almost there.

33:42.166 --> 33:43.917
(Valens)
'Keep moving.'

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
(Rush)
'You know these woods
pretty good.'

33:46.083 --> 33:47.959
This where you're
from,
you sick bastard?

33:49.500 --> 33:50.625
(Rush)
'What's that?'

34:13.458 --> 34:15.083
Got somethin'.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.625
If only you had
videos of your own.

34:18.709 --> 34:20.000
Of course, there'd be
no one in them.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.083
- No one to show them to.
- Shut up.

34:23.166 --> 34:24.083
I'm taking a look.

34:24.166 --> 34:25.875
- Scotty?
- I got it.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.542
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.125
It's a dried up well.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.000
You said you wanted to know
what happened to Brenda.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.625
Well, Brenda's not in there.

34:42.709 --> 34:44.625
No, but someone else is.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.750
(female #2)
'So cold.'

35:05.834 --> 35:07.333
So cold.

35:12.583 --> 35:14.166
So cold.
So cold.

35:21.208 --> 35:23.250
Please help me!

36:07.875 --> 36:10.750
It was the most beautiful
thing
I ever saw.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.917
Watching a woman die?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.291
Watching her give up.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.041
The rest is just a formality.

36:21.041 --> 36:23.125
We understand each other
finally.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.583
Dungeons like this well.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.834
You were trying
to recreate this, hmm?

36:29.834 --> 36:32.291
- Who was she?
- Nobody.

36:34.125 --> 36:37.250
I came here.
I listened to your story.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.709
- Now tell me where Brenda is.
- You're just like them!

36:39.792 --> 36:42.208
Tryin' to hold on
to something make-believe.

36:42.291 --> 36:44.375
'Because there will
always be another'

36:44.458 --> 36:46.208
Brenda out there, another me.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.000
Maybe it's time you see,
detective

36:48.083 --> 36:49.500
how false your God is.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.125
Tell me where she is.

36:52.709 --> 36:54.542
Looks like
we've run out of time.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.250
Where is she?

36:56.333 --> 36:59.750
- She's dead.
- No.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.792
- Pull the trigger!
- You son of a bitch.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.375
(Valens)
'Lil, it's what he wants.'

37:03.458 --> 37:05.875
Can't spend his life in a
cell
like his victims did.

37:05.959 --> 37:08.750
That's why he brought us
out here.

37:08.834 --> 37:11.166
She was weak.
Like you.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.625
Brenda's alive.
I know she is.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.417
She wasn't like that woman
in the well, she was strong.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.500
You need to believe that,
but you're wrong.

37:18.583 --> 37:19.667
No.

37:19.750 --> 37:23.792
She broke in that dark,
lonely, little room.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.959
Just like one day
you will, too.

38:11.917 --> 38:14.125
You can't tread water forever.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.875
Eventually, you'll get tired
just like Brenda.

38:16.959 --> 38:19.000
No, that song.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.500
She was humming that song.

38:20.583 --> 38:22.583
"Chasing far all gloom
and terror

38:22.667 --> 38:25.166
brightening
all the path we tread."

38:25.250 --> 38:27.041
The bells at Ascension Church
in Kensington

38:27.125 --> 38:29.834
have been playing that song
every morning since I was a
kid.

38:32.792 --> 38:34.709
That's how Brenda knew
what day it was.

38:34.792 --> 38:36.750
That's how she held on.

38:37.792 --> 38:39.333
I told you, she's dead.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.208
Even in the ugliness
of Kensington

38:41.291 --> 38:44.709
she found something to cling
to,
something beautiful.

38:44.792 --> 38:47.125
She didn't
break,
did she, John?

38:48.208 --> 38:49.917
'She never gave up.'

38:50.000 --> 38:52.667
Because when it was all taken
away in the end

38:52.750 --> 38:54.750
she still had herself.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.208
I know where that church is.

38:59.834 --> 39:01.333
I know that neighborhood.

39:07.542 --> 39:08.792
Find her, Lil.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.625
Don't you walk away from me!

39:14.041 --> 39:15.417
Don't you leave!

41:50.166 --> 41:51.458
