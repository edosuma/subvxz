believing that Slenderman
is real is a delusion.

a few days before,

1:21:58.039 --> 1:22:00.456
Snape had come to visit her

Snape.

Attorney:
Who is that?
A "Harry Potter" character.

1:22:07.590 --> 1:22:10.257
She also will say not just
that she's heard things,

1:22:10.301 --> 1:22:12.009
but that since
as early as three,

1:22:12.053 --> 1:22:15.554
she's had some
sensory-perceptual
distortions.

1:22:15.598 --> 1:22:19.558
She might see a person
change slightly or see colors.

1:22:19.602 --> 1:22:22.519
She doesn't...
have much concern

1:22:22.563 --> 1:22:24.897
about whether she gets
a long prison sentence,

1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:29.485
because, wherever she is,
she will use Vulcan mind control

1:22:29.528 --> 1:22:33.697

to make herself believe

<i>And so, even under</i>

about the floor.

1:22:51.759 --> 1:22:54.009
Attorney 2:
Have you ever suggested
picking them up?

1:22:54.053 --> 1:22:59.598
Officer Simon: Yes, I have.
And she stated that she
liked the papers there

1:22:59.642 --> 1:23:02.851

less empty.

Officer Simon: Correct.

1:23:05.940 --> 1:23:07.815

1:23:20.538 --> 1:23:24.206
Not in our facility.
Attorney 2: Right.

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:27.710
She made clear
that her primary concern

1:23:27.753 --> 1:23:30.629
was with her relationship
with Slenderman,

1:23:30.673 --> 1:23:34.216
and she felt like
if she says the wrong thing,

1:23:34.260 --> 1:23:36.635
if she somehow
upsets Slenderman,

1:23:36.679 --> 1:23:40.681
not only hers
but her family's lives
could be in danger.

1:23:42.852 --> 1:23:45.227
With childhood schizophrenia,

1:23:45.271 --> 1:23:48.105
almost everyone
develops, eventually,

1:23:48.149 --> 1:23:51.233
negative symptoms
and cognitive symptoms.

1:23:52.403 --> 1:23:55.946
What's unique
about Morgan's circumstance

1:23:55.990 --> 1:23:58.991
is that a severe course
is so predictable.

1:24:14.467 --> 1:24:19.803
Well, we knew her diagnosis
before we went to meet them
at the hospital.

1:24:19.847 --> 1:24:23.515
We had a conference call
with two of the doctors,

1:24:23.559 --> 1:24:25.309
so we were--
we were prepared.

1:24:25.352 --> 1:24:28.395
And the reason that
we all went up there, actually,

1:24:28.439 --> 1:24:30.856
was so that
we could tell Morgan

1:24:30.900 --> 1:24:32.983
what her diagnosis was.

1:24:33.027 --> 1:24:36.487
And we thought
that it would be helpful
for her to know

1:24:36.530 --> 1:24:38.697
that her father also...

1:24:39.742 --> 1:24:41.867
had the same mental illness,

1:24:41.911 --> 1:24:45.871
because we had
never told her previously
that Matt had schizophrenia.

1:24:47.458 --> 1:24:50.209
We were very worried
about the way that
she might react

1:24:50.252 --> 1:24:53.337
to learning that
she has schizophrenia

1:24:53.380 --> 1:24:55.798
because Morgan--
Morgan's a very smart girl,

1:24:55.841 --> 1:24:58.509
and she's been reading...
Matt: Which makes me think
that she knew.

1:24:58.552 --> 1:25:02.596
Yeah.
I think when they told her,
she was probably like...

1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:04.598
Not surprised.
..."Well, that's what
I would've guessed...

1:25:05.684 --> 1:25:08.060
if I had
to diagnose myself."

1:25:10.356 --> 1:25:12.648
Angie:
What I think is
that Morgan knows

1:25:12.691 --> 1:25:15.901
that other people
don't see her hallucinations,

1:25:15.945 --> 1:25:18.237
but they're still
very real to her.

1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:20.113
Like, in her head
they are real,

1:25:20.157 --> 1:25:22.032
and they're
there with her.

1:25:22.076 --> 1:25:24.159
They're there.
Angie: But I think
that she knows

1:25:24.203 --> 1:25:26.245
that other people
don't see them.

1:25:26.288 --> 1:25:29.331
Otherwise, why would
she make an attempt to...

1:25:29.375 --> 1:25:31.750
Cover it up. Mm-hmm.
Angie:
...hide them from us, exactly.

1:25:31.794 --> 1:25:33.210
It's because
she doesn't want to lose them.

1:25:33.254 --> 1:25:35.087
She's afraid they would
be taken from her.

1:25:41.387 --> 1:25:43.679

This is the doll house,

1:25:43.722 --> 1:25:45.973

for a doll house,

1:25:46.016 --> 1:25:48.183

while she was housed

1:25:48.227 --> 1:25:51.061
at Washington County
Juvenile Detention Center.

1:25:52.606 --> 1:25:55.274
And she just put so much...

1:25:56.235 --> 1:25:59.027
detail into it, it's amazing.

1:25:59.071 --> 1:26:01.780

to have scissors,

surprising is how few times

Here's some food.

That seems like
an unusual thing to say.

1:31:18.182 --> 1:31:21.099
It does.
Attorney: Did you ask her
what she meant by that?

1:31:21.143 --> 1:31:25.228
I did.
Attorney: And did you have
to ask her multiple times?

1:31:25.272 --> 1:31:26.563
I did.

1:31:26.607 --> 1:31:28.690
Attorney:
Okay, after you asked her
multiple times

1:31:28.734 --> 1:31:31.651
what she meant
by "It had to be done,"

1:31:31.695 --> 1:31:33.862
what did she offer you
or what did she say?

1:31:33.906 --> 1:31:35.780

that the man ordered it.

1:31:42.581 --> 1:31:43.663

Attorney: Like three?
Three.

1:31:47.377 --> 1:31:50.503
Attorney: What did that--
did you try to understand
what that meant?

1:31:50.547 --> 1:31:52.714
I asked her if that meant
three years ago,

1:31:52.758 --> 1:31:55.926
and she said,
"No, at age three."

1:31:55.969 --> 1:31:59.846
She believed that
she communicated telepathically

1:31:59.890 --> 1:32:03.099
with Slenderman, and that...

1:32:03.143 --> 1:32:06.519
once the communication began,
that she had to do

1:32:06.563 --> 1:32:09.272
what it was
that Slenderman demanded.

1:32:09.316 --> 1:32:11.191

what was demanded,

1:32:11.235 --> 1:32:12.859

wouldn't be safe?

Dr. Robbins,
was Morgan's entry

1:32:18.158 --> 1:32:22.327
into this particular crime
because of her psychosis?

1:33:10.210 --> 1:33:12.836
