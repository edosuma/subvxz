WEBVTT

00:59.726 --> 01:01.144
Poor Wolfy.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.188
Do you think Luxcraft's gonna bereally cross?

01:04.772 --> 01:06.567
I'm trying to listen.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.279
I mean, he was surrounded by disarrays.

01:10.362 --> 01:11.405
Right, Floof?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.698
Uh-huh.

01:14.533 --> 01:18.412
In fact, it's a jolly good thingWolfy was there to save the day.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.249
He did what any hero would do.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.002
And those disarrays didn't knowwhat hit them.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.172
He was all like, "Boom!"And they were all like, "Oh, no!"

01:28.255 --> 01:31.466
-And then I was like---Sprout! Would you please just--

01:34.344 --> 01:36.305
Did I do something wrong?

01:36.388 --> 01:39.141
No. Look, I just--

01:39.808 --> 01:42.060
I don't know why you like him so much.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.271
There's something strange about him.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.900
He said he was a human,but you saw what happened in Guardian Lab.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.652
He's not likeany human I've ever seen before.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.198
I mean, do we really know who he is?

01:55.699 --> 01:56.909
He's our friend.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.037
Since when do we need other friends?

02:01.788 --> 02:04.875
Never mind. Let's listen.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.838
And then "boom"?

02:09.922 --> 02:10.923
Boom.

02:12.382 --> 02:16.678
It seems your definition of laying lowis a little different than mine.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.096
I'm sorry, sir.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.307
I didn't mean to cause a scene.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.851
I've really been trying to fit in here.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.145
Please, just don't send me home.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.732
Send you home? Certainly not.You definitely can't leave now.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.442
Can't leave?

02:30.526 --> 02:34.488
I mean, if you want to stay,you must stay, of course.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.490
Of course.

02:36.573 --> 02:40.035
Do you still have this thingamabob?

02:40.118 --> 02:41.537
Thingamabob?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.456
You mean Excaliboom! Yes.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.042
Well, what's left of it.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.216
And you say you made this?

02:54.800 --> 02:58.095
Yeah, but it never really worked before.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.890
When the disarrays were closing in,

03:01.974 --> 03:06.061
I guess I kinda forgot it wasn't real.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.604
Forgot?

03:07.688 --> 03:11.733
Yeah. It just felt real.Just for a moment.

03:12.359 --> 03:16.613
I don't know how to explain it,but I can't get it to work now.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.323
I think it's broken.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.785
Fascinating.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.620
Can you fix it?

03:26.498 --> 03:27.499
Hey!

03:28.000 --> 03:32.838
It's not that piece of cardboardthat has powers, boy. It's you.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.632
Me?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.634
You made it, didn't you?

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
Well, yeah.

03:38.969 --> 03:43.015
Just like you made that flying sackthat propelled you through that window?

03:43.098 --> 03:45.225
It's more of a jet pack than a--

03:45.309 --> 03:47.811
Wait. How did you know about that?

03:47.895 --> 03:51.982
You are the one who is givingthese creations their power.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.193
It's almost spryte-like.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.736
Spryte-like?

03:55.819 --> 03:58.155
So, does that mean…

03:58.238 --> 03:59.990
Am I a spryte?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.241
I'm a spryte!

04:01.325 --> 04:03.702
I knew I didn't fit in with the humans!

04:03.785 --> 04:07.122
I was supposed to be here.I was a spryte all along!

04:07.206 --> 04:09.124
You are not a spryte, my boy.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.834
You're human.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.920
But…

04:15.297 --> 04:19.218
Are you sure? I'm just like everyone else?

04:19.301 --> 04:22.638
You are certainly not like everyone else.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.765
You're not like anyone else, little wolf.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.976
Little wolf?

04:30.521 --> 04:32.356
Little wolf.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.901
I know who you areand who you will become.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.779
Are you listening?

04:39.738 --> 04:42.658
Yeah. Sorry, what?

04:42.741 --> 04:44.743
Now, I don't want you to worry.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.163
Just keep that mask onand keep your head down.

04:48.247 --> 04:52.960
But wait. If I'm really a human,what happened in the Guardian Lab?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.419
Do I really have powers?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.965
All in good time. All in good time.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.927
And what is the meaning of this?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.929
We weren't listening! No, no.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.473
We were just leaning.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.392
Yes, that's it. Leaning.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.353
You know, sometimesyou just need a good lean.

05:14.314 --> 05:19.903
I need you three to lay low.Much, much lower than before.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.364
Nobody must discover who he is.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.284
What? Why? Who am I?

05:25.367 --> 05:26.451
No more questions.

05:26.535 --> 05:30.122
The three of you must stay in your dormuntil further notice.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.207
But, sir--

05:32.291 --> 05:34.459
No ifs, no buts, no coconuts.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.798
Especially no coconuts.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.307
So we're grounded now? That's just great.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.685
You really have a talentfor messing things up, Wolfboy.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.687
If that even is your real name.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.856
Maybe it would be better for everyone

05:55.939 --> 05:58.525
if you went back to the surfacewhere you belong.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.902
But he belongs here.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.112
No, I'm not a spryte.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.073
Xandra's right.I don't belong here either.

06:07.910 --> 06:12.748
Look, what say we go back to the dormand have a nice tea party?

06:12.831 --> 06:15.125
Wolfy, you can pick the biscuits.

06:15.209 --> 06:18.128
I'm sorry, Sprout.I'm just not in the mood.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.590
Not in the mood? For biscuits?

06:24.009 --> 06:27.554
I wish Luxcraft would just tell mewhat was going on.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.265
What do you mean,tell you what's going on?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.475
I don't know.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.229
I just get the feeling thathe's not telling me everything.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.940
And then there was his necklace…

06:38.023 --> 06:39.274
His necklace?

06:39.358 --> 06:42.402
Yeah. He was wearing this pendant.

06:42.486 --> 06:45.405
The weird thing is,I'm sure I've seen it before.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.282
I had a sort of flashback.

06:47.366 --> 06:50.077
-Did you now?-I did.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.121
It was like a very hazy memory.

06:53.205 --> 06:57.459
And I heard this voice saying somethingabout knowing who I really am?

06:57.543 --> 07:00.712
And… If I could just remember more.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.965
Too bad we have to stay in our dorm,

07:03.048 --> 07:05.717
otherwise you could have goneto the Memory Maze.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.845
-The what?-The Memory Maze.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.639
It's where all the world's memoriesare stored.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.433
That sounds perfect. Let's go there.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.145
What? No!Well, I didn't mean we'd actually--

07:17.229 --> 07:18.981
And if we can find my memory,

07:19.064 --> 07:22.150
we might be able to find outwhat Luxcraft is hiding.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.735
Okay. Hold on--

07:23.819 --> 07:25.988
We'll finally get some answers.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.781
Now, wait just one minute.

07:27.865 --> 07:32.369
It's strictly forbidden to go intothe Memory Maze without a guardian spryte.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.664
Xandra's a guardian spryte… in training.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.082
No, no, no!

07:37.165 --> 07:42.129
Luxcraft explicitly said to stayin our dorm and have a nice tea party.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.882
But it'll be such an adventure.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.133
You go if you want.

07:46.216 --> 07:50.637
Sprout and I are going to havea tea party of our own. Right, Sprout?

07:50.721 --> 07:51.722
Please?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.477
I need to find out what's going on.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.400
Okay, Wolfy. I'll go.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.235
What? No!

08:05.319 --> 08:08.864
It's okay, Xandra.If you don't wanna come, we'll be okay.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.624
Okay, I'll come.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.792
-You will?-Thank you, Xandra.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.379
I'm not doing it for you.I'm doing it for Sprout.

08:24.463 --> 08:28.133
But if we must do something this stupid,we're doing it my way.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.259
Deal.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.594
Here's what we'll do…

09:04.294 --> 09:08.173
What are you doing in the hallafter lights-out?

09:08.257 --> 09:09.967
Come on. Out with it.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.470
Impudence! What is your name?

09:17.015 --> 09:18.851
And how are you spelling that?

09:19.643 --> 09:23.647
How dare you! Come back here.I am the law!

10:06.607 --> 10:08.609
This place is huge.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.571
How do we even knowwhere to start looking?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.072
You'll need a guideling.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.787
Wow.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.499
It'll guide you through the maze.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.960
Aren't you a helpful little guideling?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.130
What's it doing?

10:30.214 --> 10:31.882
It's tuning itself to you.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.761
Just relax and focus on that memoryso we can get this over with.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.559
Come on. We can't lose that guideling.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.271
You do not want to get lost in this place.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.070
Wait for me.

11:05.582 --> 11:11.046
And to think we could be havingbiscuits right now. And tea.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.298
All safe and cozy.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.523
What does that sign mean?

11:29.606 --> 11:32.526
It's nothing.Just watch out for the memory mites.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.652
The what now?

11:33.735 --> 11:37.489
Memory mites. They're a type of disarray.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.659
They infest the mazeand feed on the memories.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.621
Luckily, brave guardian sprytespatrol the lab,

11:44.705 --> 11:47.708
guarding the world's memoriesfrom the memory mites.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.837
But the maze is so vast,theirs is a constant battle.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.507
This is why all memories fade over time.

12:07.519 --> 12:11.481
Xandra? These mites only eatmemories, right?

12:11.565 --> 12:14.234
They wouldn't eat tasty little sprouts?

12:14.318 --> 12:16.737
Don't worry, Sprout. If anything happens--

12:16.820 --> 12:19.323
You're right! We have Wolfboy with us now.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.118
Those disarrays better watch out.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.038
I don't know about that.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.497
I do know.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.752
You'd really give 'em what for,just like you did in the Guardian Lab.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.421
You'd be all like, "Pow, boom, bah!"

12:34.505 --> 12:36.507
-I would?-That's right, you would.

12:36.590 --> 12:42.054
And the disarrays would be like, "Eeh!"And I'd be like, "Hooray!"

12:42.137 --> 12:44.306
You're just saying that.

12:45.307 --> 12:48.560
Hey, come on, slowpoke.The guideling's going this way.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.147
Maybe you two should go ahead.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.483
What about you?

12:56.818 --> 13:00.322
-You don't need me anymore.-But you don't have a guideling.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.823
What if you get lost?

13:01.907 --> 13:04.660
I don't needthe great Wolfboy to protect me.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.578
I'll be fine on my own.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.248
Xandra, we should all stick together.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.378
Have fun with your new best friend.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.506
Xandra, wait.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.134
Xandra!

13:42.573 --> 13:44.658
I don't think Xandra likes me much.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.620
Don't worry.She just takes a little while to warm up.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.789
Will she be all right?

13:50.873 --> 13:52.916
-On her own?-Oh, yes.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.670
She's the toughest, bravest,strongest spryte I know.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.339
-Just like her parents were.-Her parents?

13:59.423 --> 14:02.759
Yeah. They werebrave guardian sprytes too.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.805
But they died when she was very little.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.641
That's so sad.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.353
Then she came to live with meand my family.

14:13.437 --> 14:17.191
That must have helped a lot,having a good friend like you.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.320
I never really had many people aroundgrowing up.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.364
It was just me and Mum.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.201
Yeah, Xandra's kind of like that too.

14:27.826 --> 14:31.288
She finds it hard to make friends.But she has me.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.582
And now she's got you too.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.472
Wow.

15:08.242 --> 15:10.202
Hey, look. The guideling.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.954
It's stopped.

15:18.210 --> 15:22.297
"The Memories of William Wolfe, Age One."

15:22.965 --> 15:25.217
These are all my memories?

15:31.181 --> 15:33.559
It's like a Wolfboy storybook!

15:33.642 --> 15:37.145
Hey, I remember Teddy.He was my best friend.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.817
I think me and Teddywould have been great friends too.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.421
Like I said,I've never had friends before.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.506
But now you do.

16:26.737 --> 16:31.116
No. No. No.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.121
There! That's it.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.414
The pendant.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.258
Luxcraft, would you stop playing around?

16:48.342 --> 16:50.052
What are we going to do?

16:50.135 --> 16:53.138
I don't see what the problem is.She's gone.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.599
For now. But she will return.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.185
And when she does,she'll come for the boy.

16:58.810 --> 17:02.773
Come now, Luxcraft.What would she want with a human child?

17:02.856 --> 17:05.025
If this boy is who I think he is--

17:05.108 --> 17:08.487
Even if he is, it would be madnessto bring him to the Factory.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.821
What if I am right, and she finds him?

17:10.906 --> 17:13.407
It cannot be allowed to happen!

17:13.492 --> 17:17.454
We should take him with us,to protect him. To prepare him.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.748
I'm sorry, Luxcraft. It's too risky.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.042
He must stay on the surface,where he belongs.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.798
They don't yet realize who you are,but I do.

17:27.881 --> 17:31.593
I know who you areand who you will become.

17:32.261 --> 17:34.137
Stay safe, little wolf.

17:39.226 --> 17:43.605
So, Professor Luxcraft knew youbefore you even came down here?

17:43.689 --> 17:44.690
I guess.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.192
I knew he was hiding something.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.610
Who was he talking to?

17:48.694 --> 17:49.736
I don't know.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.822
And who does he think you are?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.240
I don't know.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.951
And who is he worriedwould come looking for you?

17:56.034 --> 17:59.246
I don't know! But I need to find out.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.291
Oh, dear.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.126
Sprout?

18:08.630 --> 18:09.882
Xandra!

18:13.051 --> 18:14.386
Help!

18:14.469 --> 18:15.929
Xandra!

18:16.471 --> 18:19.391
Sprout? I'm coming!

18:19.474 --> 18:20.475
Help!

18:25.981 --> 18:28.442
Is that thing still behind us?

18:28.525 --> 18:30.736
No. I think we lost it.

18:32.446 --> 18:33.822
We didn't lose it!

18:38.202 --> 18:39.369
Let go!

18:45.959 --> 18:48.545
-Xandra!-Sprout!

18:48.629 --> 18:50.005
Leave me alone!

18:50.589 --> 18:52.049
He's got Wolfboy!

18:52.841 --> 18:54.009
Hey!

18:55.093 --> 18:56.512
Thanks, Xandra.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.805
Keep formation. Advance with me.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.098
Oh, crumbs.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.727
If something happens to me,tell my twigs I love them.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.939
And Norman. Poor Norman.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.240
-What's it doing?-What?

19:16.323 --> 19:18.617
Make it stop!

19:18.700 --> 19:20.077
What?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.411
It stopped.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.081
What's that?

19:26.959 --> 19:28.585
What?

19:32.005 --> 19:33.090
Oh, no.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.591
What? What's happening?

19:34.675 --> 19:37.094
I think it was calling for backup.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.191
Memory mites.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.237
Run!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.039
Oh, no!

20:06.790 --> 20:08.125
We've got you, Sprout.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.009
Now what?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.761
We stand and we fight.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.639
Stand back, you two. I'll handle this.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.767
What are you doing?

20:25.851 --> 20:28.937
I'm not letting you face this alone.I'm with you.

20:29.813 --> 20:30.814
Why?

20:30.898 --> 20:33.025
Because friends stick together.

20:36.612 --> 20:37.821
That's so sweet.

20:37.905 --> 20:40.324
But there's thousands of them!

20:40.407 --> 20:42.784
We need a new plan, quick.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.787
Okay. New plan.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.879
Xandra!

20:57.966 --> 20:59.051
Xandra!

21:13.273 --> 21:14.816
We did it!

21:14.900 --> 21:17.069
Don't you ever do that again.

21:17.986 --> 21:20.739
Now, I have just one question.

21:21.365 --> 21:23.408
How are we getting down?

21:23.492 --> 21:26.078
Since they're coming up.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.788
I have a plan.

21:40.509 --> 21:41.802
Yes!

21:44.930 --> 21:46.390
Nice job, human.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.564
Run!

21:59.403 --> 22:01.363
Memory guardians!

22:02.281 --> 22:04.408
What are you sprytelings doing here?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.952
We can deal with these memory mites.

22:08.370 --> 22:11.582
Take this. And get your friends to safety.

22:30.726 --> 22:32.394
There's been another breach.

22:32.895 --> 22:35.564
In the Memory Maze. Hundreds of them!

22:35.647 --> 22:38.609
Don't you seethe disarrays are on the rise?

22:38.692 --> 22:41.695
We can't ignore this any longer.The prophecy says--

22:41.778 --> 22:44.406
Prophecy? This flimshaw again?

22:44.489 --> 22:47.284
We don't have timefor your nonsense, Luxcraft.

22:47.868 --> 22:49.995
Flimshaw to your flimshaw!

22:50.078 --> 22:51.955
It's not nonsense.

22:52.039 --> 22:54.416
Let me bring the boy here.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.753
We can train him.

22:57.836 --> 23:04.176
Prepare him for what's to comeand for the role he's destined to play.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.680
We will need him. It's the only way.

23:09.473 --> 23:11.808
Do you even know where the boy is?

23:13.435 --> 23:14.853
No.

23:15.646 --> 23:16.897
But we have to act.

23:16.980 --> 23:20.734
The time has come. She is behind this.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.361
I'm sorry, Luxcraft,

23:22.444 --> 23:28.075
but we can't be sure this disarray attackhas anything to do with her.

23:28.158 --> 23:32.287
Disarrays attack all the time.That's just the way of things.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.748
Then I'll find another wayto prove it to you.

23:34.831 --> 23:38.836
Now, if you'll excuse me,I have a journey ahead of me.

23:38.919 --> 23:41.505
Luxcraft, don't be hasty.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.883
Let the old fool go.

23:46.718 --> 23:50.430
So, Luxcraft wanted to bring you here,

23:50.514 --> 23:52.933
but the others said it was too dangerous?

23:53.016 --> 23:56.353
Yeah, and that I didn't belong here.

23:56.436 --> 24:00.148
Well, I'm glad you're here, human.I don't mind a bit of danger.

24:00.232 --> 24:01.400
Same here!

24:01.483 --> 24:03.443
Well, not the danger bit.

24:04.278 --> 24:07.739
I just want to thank you twofor helping me.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.449
I mean, I--

24:09.533 --> 24:11.952
Okay, don't get all weepy on us now.

24:12.786 --> 24:16.874
But I'm sorry if I was a bit of a--

24:16.957 --> 24:18.041
A grumpy bum?

24:19.042 --> 24:21.128
Yeah. Something like that.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.264
My queen.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.896
The boy. He is here.
