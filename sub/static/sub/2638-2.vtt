WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:07.339
Worst Renaissance fair ever.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.300
Please let it go, Sheldon.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.512
SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.181
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.642
Now, her costume
was obviously Germanic...

00:18.810 --> 00:23.022
...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws,
or Reinheitsgebot...

00:23.189 --> 00:25.607
...severely limited the availability
of mead.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.776
At best,
they would've had some spiced wine.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.529
LEONARD: You're nitpicking.
SHELDON: Oh, really?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.238
Well, here's another nit for you.

00:32.406 --> 00:35.534
The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.746
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.498
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...

00:41.666 --> 00:43.667
...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...

00:43.835 --> 00:46.795
...their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."

00:47.589 --> 00:50.215
Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy,"
in the 15th century.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.634
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."

00:52.802 --> 00:54.803
I don't care what the bosoms say,
Sheldon.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.723
I just wanna be part of the conversation.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.641
Hi, guys.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.935
Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.063
I'm hoping.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.272
Renaissance fair?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.691
More of a medieval-slash-
Age of Enlightenment...

01:07.859 --> 01:11.070
...slash-
any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.239
Okay, fine, whatever.
Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.533
- Hello.
ERIC: Hey.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.955
So, yeah, good to see you.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.666
Yeah. Yeah, it's good to see you too.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.711
- We should probably go.
- Yeah.

01:27.879 --> 01:31.131
- Bye, guys.
- Like your hat.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.676
Thanks, my mom made it.

01:36.679 --> 01:40.015
Penny with a new guy. Très awkward.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.185
It wasn't awkward.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.189
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?

01:47.357 --> 01:50.776
We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.612
By "moving on," you mean
she's going out with other men...

01:53.780 --> 01:57.908
...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.035
That was not 15th-century soap.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.247
My god, those people need to learn
you can't just put "ye olde"...

02:03.414 --> 02:06.375
...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.

02:06.543 --> 02:10.128
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.549
You're wearing modern underwear?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.301
Relatively modern.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.554
What are you wearing?

02:18.721 --> 02:22.683
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.184
You went and bought linen?

02:24.352 --> 02:27.563
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.067
Borrowed?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:56.259 --> 02:58.260
You know,
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.262
It gives me freedom to move on myself.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.599
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

03:04.475 --> 03:06.977
Of course. Out of respect.

03:07.145 --> 03:11.273
So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?

03:12.066 --> 03:14.318
Who were you respecting then?

03:14.777 --> 03:17.070
What? I've dated plenty of women.

03:17.238 --> 03:21.450
There was, uh, Joyce Kim,
Leslie Winkle...

03:22.952 --> 03:25.412
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary:

03:25.580 --> 03:28.624
The word "plenty"
has been redefined to mean "two."

03:30.877 --> 03:32.878
What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.713
- It doesn't count.
- Why not?

03:34.881 --> 03:38.634
What happens in costume at Comic-Con
stays at Comic-Con.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.220
You're only saying that
because of what happened.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.847
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.474
It wasn't your fault, Raj.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.894
He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.981
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.443
- Dude, you have totally not moved on.
- Yes, I have.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.863
It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.742
- Like who?
- Well, there's Joyce Kim.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.329
But she defected back to North Korea...

04:07.789 --> 04:10.415
...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.086
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.672
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy...

04:16.839 --> 04:19.675
...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...

04:19.841 --> 04:23.053
...and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.181
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.061
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.397
Mud.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.609
Look, I like Leslie,
but she's not interested in dating...

04:37.777 --> 04:40.362
...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.031
Yeah? So? Be a tool.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.369
Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.

04:47.537 --> 04:51.373
It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.710
You mean like you
and Richard the slave girl?

04:56.045 --> 04:59.548
I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.676
And he told me his name was Kimberly.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.600
You know how I know
we're not in the Matrix?

05:14.105 --> 05:15.397
How?

05:15.898 --> 05:19.151
If we were, the food would be better.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.403
Hey, Leonard.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.323
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.

05:24.699 --> 05:28.744
Hello to you,
insufficiently intelligent person.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.997
Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.918
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.463
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me...

05:39.630 --> 05:43.091
...I'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...

05:43.259 --> 05:47.387
...as opposed to what you do,
which does not.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.307
Yeah, you heard me.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.487
Wow.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.449
So I heard your relationship with Penny
crashed to the ground...

06:07.617 --> 06:10.452
...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.

06:11.454 --> 06:15.874
- Where'd you hear that?
- Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.128
"Like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.882
Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."

06:24.050 --> 06:25.509
Anyway, it got me thinking.

06:25.676 --> 06:29.638
Now that you're unattached, maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.225
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.935
No, I'm all done with casual sex.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.979
I'm fully committed
to the traditional relationship paradigm.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.147
Really? What changed?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.650
There's just a time
in every woman's life...

06:41.818 --> 06:44.111
...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...

06:44.278 --> 06:46.530
...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.826
Yeah, I can see how that would...
A bunch of people?

06:50.993 --> 06:53.495
Anyway, I just figure
it's time to slow things down...

06:53.663 --> 06:56.706
...and who better to slow things down with
than you?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.334
I'm flattered.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.338
So how do you suggest we proceed?

07:03.506 --> 07:07.008
Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.177
Then light petting, no coitus.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.723
- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.018
I think it's better
if you assume the male role.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.689
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.858
Great.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.693
Call me.

07:30.533 --> 07:34.077
Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.454
LEONARD:
Oh.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.166
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?

07:39.333 --> 07:43.545
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.382
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.

07:47.550 --> 07:51.261
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.

07:51.429 --> 07:55.891
We can pick up right where I left off
in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.059
The thing is, someone's coming over.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.521
Well, no problem. I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.316
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.692
Oh.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.404
Well, you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.909
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.703
- Well, statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.330
Nevertheless, I have one now...

08:18.498 --> 08:21.917
...and I'd appreciate it if you would,
you know, make yourself scarce.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.878
I am a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates...

08:25.046 --> 08:27.464
...and an IQ which can't be measured
by normal tests.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.925
How much scarcer could I be?

08:30.927 --> 08:34.304
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.806
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.392
You mean just go someplace else
and be...

08:39.559 --> 08:41.102
...someplace else?

08:41.562 --> 08:43.063
- Yes.
- But why should I leave?

08:43.231 --> 08:45.273
- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.235
If science ever discovers a second member
of your species...

08:48.402 --> 08:52.280
...and you two would like some privacy,
I'd be happy to get out of your way.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.451
Well, all right, then.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.874
Sheldon? What are you doing?

09:03.042 --> 09:08.505
Playing "Super Mario"
on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.799
But why are you doing it on the stairs?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.636
I am a modern-day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase...

09:14.804 --> 09:17.889
...because Leonard, get this, has a date.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.893
Oh. Oh, well, good for him.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.772
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you go to a movie or something?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.649
Alone?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.235
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.737
Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?

09:33.447 --> 09:35.824
- Then don't order popcorn.
- No popcorn at the mov...?

09:35.992 --> 09:37.075
Listen to yourself.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.413
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.665
They have other things.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.127
- What do they have?
- I don't know. You know, cookies, pastries...

09:47.295 --> 09:50.338
- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.215
I don't like bear claws.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.553
Hey, Penny. Dumb-ass.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.931
Leslie Winkle.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.184
Of all the overrated physicists
in all the labs in all the world...

10:03.352 --> 10:06.354
...why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?

10:06.522 --> 10:09.858
Well, they have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.944
Please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science...

10:13.112 --> 10:15.864
...would be if they resumed sending chimps
into space.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.868
Okay, well, I have a date too,
so I'll see you.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.664
Everybody has a date.

10:24.832 --> 10:29.210
Even you, Mario,
going after Princess Peach.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.797
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.055
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.389
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.100
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.230
So how many children
do you think we should have?

10:49.398 --> 10:50.774
[COUGHING]

10:51.609 --> 10:54.653
I'm sorry, that was a little abrupt.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.112
A little.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.324
There are so many things to talk about
before reproduction.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.242
I sure hope so.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.081
Besides shortness, what genetic
weaknesses run in your family?

11:07.208 --> 11:11.252
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying. Continue.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.965
Uh, genetic weaknesses, right.
Um, there's the lactose intolerance.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.760
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.

11:19.303 --> 11:23.765
When his uncles sit around the dinner
table, they look like a half-carton of eggs.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.911
Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald...

11:45.079 --> 11:49.290
...but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest
women you'll ever meet, so, you know...

11:49.458 --> 11:53.378
Sweet lady.
It always tickles when she hugs me.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.423
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

11:57.967 --> 12:00.969
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.935
I'm sorry
about all of Sheldon's interruptions.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.979
He can be a bit of an eccentric.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.188
If by "eccentric"...

12:12.356 --> 12:15.316
...you mean "passive-aggressive
East Texas blowhole," I agree.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.028
Well, I think tonight
was a very good start.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.157
Me too. You're sure you're okay
postponing intercourse...

12:22.324 --> 12:25.326
...until our relationship
is past the initial viability test?

12:26.203 --> 12:28.830
No problem.
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.877
I guess I'll call you
and we'll arrange another evening.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.130
I believe protocol dictates
that you wait a minimum of 18 hours...

12:37.298 --> 12:40.341
...before you call so I'm not repulsed
by your cloying eagerness.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.845
- Sure.
- Again, it's your decision. You're the man.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.221
PENNY:
No, it wasn't my cat.

12:45.389 --> 12:49.142
It was an experiment designed
by this guy named Schrödinger.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.021
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?

12:54.356 --> 12:57.692
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.486
- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hello.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.738
- Leslie.
LESLIE: Hi.

13:05.367 --> 13:08.453
Okay, well, good night.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.874
Okay, well, good night.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.045
That ain't gonna make your point.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.392
Okay, okay, that's enough.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.437
Call me.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.899
Right.

13:38.567 --> 13:39.609
[DOOR CLOSES]

13:39.777 --> 13:40.944
Well, okay, good night.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.363
- What?
- Had a great time. Ciao.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.452
I'm sorry, I am not going back
to the Renaissance fair.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.662
Come on, Sheldon.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.874
There are so few places
I can wear my jester costume.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.587
I don't care. There are far too many
historical anomalies for my comfort.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.130
Oh, okay, how about this?

14:01.298 --> 14:04.008
You can go dressed
as a Star Trek science officer...

14:04.176 --> 14:07.929
...exploring a planet similar to Earth
in the 1500s.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.764
You mean like Spock?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.100
Sure.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.769
Fascinating.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.440
- Hey, fellow scientists. Sheldon.
LEONARD: Mm.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.028
Why don't we move there
so Leslie can join us?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.321
Yeah, let's do it.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.204
If you're having trouble
deciding where to sit...

14:33.372 --> 14:35.123
...I suggest One Potato, Two Potato...

14:35.291 --> 14:39.335
...or as I call it, the Leslie Winkle
Experimental Methodology.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.966
- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard. It's simple.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.177
You can either sit with me,
your friend, colleague and roommate...

14:48.345 --> 14:52.140
...or you can sit with an overrated scientist
you might have sex with.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.226
You're right, it is simple.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.650
- Hey, Sheldon.
SHELDON: Penny.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.820
Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?

15:07.031 --> 15:08.281
Oh.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.493
I still don't understand
why you don't just go to dinner.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.038
All right, let's say I go to dinner alone...

15:15.205 --> 15:17.498
...and during the meal
I have to use the restroom.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.752
How do I know
someone's not touching my food?

15:24.089 --> 15:26.090
Good night, Sheldon.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.301
Penny, hold on.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.262
You sure things can't work out
with you and Leonard?

15:31.430 --> 15:32.472
Excuse me?

15:32.640 --> 15:36.517
I'm just wondering
if you really gave it the old college try.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.688
Or in your case,
the old community-college try.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.776
Okay, where is this coming from?

15:45.402 --> 15:48.780
Leonard is upstairs right now
with my archenemy.

15:48.948 --> 15:53.201
- Your archenemy?
- Yes, the Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.203
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man.

15:55.371 --> 15:59.082
- The Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel...
- Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.210
It's amazing how many super villains
have advanced degrees.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.215
Graduate schools should do a better job
of screening those people out.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.217
Sheldon, come back. You're losing me.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.762
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
She belittles my research.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.139
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.600
She called me "dumb-ass."

16:18.310 --> 16:19.727
I know, I heard.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.354
Given the situation...

16:21.522 --> 16:24.315
...I have no choice
but to withdraw my previous objections...

16:24.483 --> 16:27.568
...to your ill-considered relationship
with Leonard.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.905
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.117
But, um, I think for now
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.245
No. That response is unacceptable to me.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.749
- You are a smart guy. You must know...
- I'm smart?

16:41.917 --> 16:45.920
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points
to be classified as "smart."

16:46.255 --> 16:48.589
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.093
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie
wanna be together...

16:52.261 --> 16:54.429
...nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

16:54.596 --> 16:58.307
You continue to underestimate
my capabilities, madam.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.020
Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're Leonard's friend...

17:02.187 --> 17:05.272
...you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.776
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?

17:09.444 --> 17:10.944
If Leonard's really my friend...

17:11.113 --> 17:14.615
...why doesn't he have to support me
in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?

17:16.242 --> 17:18.953
Because love trumps hate.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.040
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.001
Okay. Good night, Sheldon.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.463
Oh, Mario.

17:28.630 --> 17:32.467
If only I could control everyone
the way I control you.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.472
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.

17:41.769 --> 17:46.147
When the two of you reach a natural
stopping point, I'd like to have a word.

17:46.315 --> 17:50.151
If the word is "pee-pee," just do it.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.449
Leonard, you're my friend...

17:56.617 --> 17:59.494
...and friends support their friends,
apparently.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.704
So I am withdrawing my objection...

18:01.872 --> 18:05.333
...to your desire
to have a relationship with Leslie.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.044
- Thank you.
- I will graciously overlook the fact...

18:08.212 --> 18:10.630
...that she is an arrogant,
subpar scientist...

18:10.798 --> 18:14.092
...who believes loop quantum gravity
better unites quantum mechanics...

18:14.259 --> 18:17.678
...with general relativity
than does string theory.

You kids have fun.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.141
Hang on a second.

18:22.309 --> 18:26.062
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more
testable predictions than string theory.

18:26.563 --> 18:29.524
I'm listening. Amuse me.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.443
Okay, well, for one thing,
we expect quantized space-time...

18:32.611 --> 18:36.364
...to manifest as minute differences
in the speed of light for different colors.

18:36.532 --> 18:40.576
Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.539
Are you gonna let him talk to me
like that?

18:49.211 --> 18:51.629
Okay, well,
there is a lot of merit to both theories.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.716
No, there isn't. Only loop quantum gravity
calculates the entropy of black holes.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.056
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.892
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.978
You agree with me, right?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.730
Loop quantum gravity
is the future of physics.

19:10.274 --> 19:14.610
Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer
my space stringy, not loopy.

19:14.778 --> 19:18.489
Well, I'm glad I found out the truth
about you before this went any further.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.116
Truth? What truth?

19:20.284 --> 19:23.536
We're talking about untested hypotheses...
Look, it's no big deal.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.745
Oh, it isn't? Really?

19:24.913 --> 19:27.582
Tell me, Leonard,
how will we raise the children?

19:30.544 --> 19:34.922
I guess we wait until they're old enough
and let them choose their own theory.

19:35.090 --> 19:38.134
We can't let them choose, Leonard,
they're children.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.637
Wait, where are you going?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.431
I'm sorry.

I could've accepted our kids
being genetically unable to eat ice cream...
