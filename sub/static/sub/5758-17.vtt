Previously on
<i>Pretty Little Liars...</i>

00:02.274 --> 00:04.279
I still feel like we're
rushing this.

00:04.280 --> 00:06.061
I'm not the one calling the shots.

00:06.062 --> 00:09.232
Who are you? 
I'm Lyndon James. Nate doesn't exist.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.131
Mona has people watching their every move.

00:13.132 --> 00:15.373
There's no way that she has
someone watching all of us.

00:15.374 --> 00:16.828
We can put an end to this.

00:19.406 --> 00:20.629
He's the father of my son.

00:20.630 --> 00:22.093
Yeah, he deserves to know that.

00:22.094 --> 00:24.035
I need some time to sort this all out.

00:24.036 --> 00:25.895
If he figures out that I'm
lying to him... he won't.

00:25.896 --> 00:27.026
Everything okay?

00:31.884 --> 00:33.537
It's my powerhouse potion.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.379
Aria knows that you saw Alison that night.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.581
I swear, I didn't hurt Alison.

00:37.582 --> 00:39.428
Last chance to save yourself.

00:39.838 --> 00:41.036
Yes, it is.

00:42.836 --> 00:44.514
Is this what you're looking for?

00:44.644 --> 00:47.754
Will you just tell me that what
I saw tonight wasn't real?

00:48.588 --> 00:49.763
Please tell me.

02:09.398 --> 02:11.315
Spencer needs to talk to her sister.

02:11.316 --> 02:13.633
Okay, but she needs to
talk to one of us first.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.628
I've tried her, like, three
times with no answer.

02:15.629 --> 02:16.953
Yeah. I haven't heard from her either,

02:16.954 --> 02:18.124
and neither has Hanna.

02:18.254 --> 02:20.292
I wonder if we should even tell her at all.

02:20.376 --> 02:22.639
Do you remember when we thought
Melissa was torturing us?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.493
Aria, your dad said that he saw Melissa

02:24.494 --> 02:26.599
outside Ali's house the
night she was murdered.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.726
I don't think she was out
for an evening stroll.

02:28.846 --> 02:30.189
She must know something.

02:30.190 --> 02:33.388
I know, I just... think we should hold off.

02:34.898 --> 02:37.080
I've gotta go. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

02:37.292 --> 02:38.274
Come in.

02:39.714 --> 02:42.041
Hey. I thought you were
coming back downstairs.

02:42.042 --> 02:44.280
I have to work super early tomorrow.

02:45.068 --> 02:46.028
What's that?

02:46.852 --> 02:47.878
It's for you.

02:48.624 --> 02:50.479
It came in this morning, but I wasn't sure

02:50.480 --> 02:51.912
if I should give it to you or not.

02:52.662 --> 02:53.884
Why? What is it?

02:56.570 --> 02:57.864
James family...?

02:58.324 --> 03:00.706
I don't know a James family in Chicago.

03:01.186 --> 03:03.105
Wasn't that Nate's real name?

03:06.634 --> 03:07.804
Look, honey, do you want me just to take it

03:07.805 --> 03:09.465
down to the police station? No.

03:09.466 --> 03:10.077
Really, 'cause I could just

03:10.078 --> 03:11.585
have one of the police
officers open it for you.

03:11.586 --> 03:13.753
Mom, you just started working there.

03:14.148 --> 03:16.454
They're gonna ask you a
million questions about...

03:16.526 --> 03:20.684
Me, about Maya, about Nate, and...

03:21.470 --> 03:23.109
Why I ever trusted him.

03:24.062 --> 03:25.437
Look, I never should have
brought this up here.

03:25.438 --> 03:28.756
No, don't take it. I want to open it.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.196
Why did he have these?

03:46.264 --> 03:48.222
These are all things I gave to Ali.

03:49.904 --> 03:51.481
Maya must have found them in Ali's house

03:51.482 --> 03:53.600
and tried to give them back to me.

03:53.846 --> 03:55.741
Look, sweetie, just put the
stuff away and come downstairs.

03:55.742 --> 03:57.724
No, no, I'm fine. I...

04:00.466 --> 04:03.240
I just hate the thought of
him touching any of this.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.549
Why would they send this to me?

04:09.380 --> 04:11.586
I guess they're just doing what they can.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.560
You know, they couldn't undo
what their son did, so...

04:15.358 --> 04:17.492
I should have just opened that myself.

04:18.209 --> 04:21.208
Look, are you sure you don't
wanna just come downstairs?

04:21.776 --> 04:24.431
Not tonight. I'm really tired.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.110
I should probably just go to bed.

04:26.966 --> 04:27.854
All right.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.818
Why are you sitting in the dark?

05:00.262 --> 05:02.812
I'm not. Your arm still bothering you?

05:03.308 --> 05:04.460
Not so much.

05:04.490 --> 05:06.161
How did you hurt yourself again?

05:06.690 --> 05:08.856
It was stupid. I just slipped in gym.

05:10.116 --> 05:10.625
Well, don't you think it's

05:10.626 --> 05:12.392
something a doctor should take a look at?

05:12.393 --> 05:14.118
Mom, seriously, I'm fine.

05:14.656 --> 05:16.214
I can type with one hand.

05:18.138 --> 05:21.089
Well, clearly, you need two to wash a pot.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.848
Typing is not scraping.

05:32.778 --> 05:33.932
How's school going?

05:35.155 --> 05:37.304
Is it still difficult
to see Mona every day?

05:38.560 --> 05:40.454
We only have two classes together.

05:41.464 --> 05:42.662
Two's a lot.

05:44.322 --> 05:46.507
If it's distracting, I can
talk to Mr. Tamborelli

05:46.508 --> 05:48.227
and help you transfer...

05:48.228 --> 05:50.050
mom, she'd still be there.

05:50.432 --> 05:52.480
I'm not gonna avoid going
down every hallway.

05:52.481 --> 05:53.778
I understand.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.137
I-I'm just trying to protect...

05:56.138 --> 05:57.928
why do you think I need protection?

05:58.883 --> 06:01.297
I meant... to protect your education.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.341
Is there something else
I need to know about?

06:06.192 --> 06:07.662
Is it happening again?

06:08.202 --> 06:10.264
Hanna? No, there's nothing.

06:10.554 --> 06:12.840
I just don't need anyone
else protecting me, okay?

06:13.777 --> 06:15.718
One caped crusader is enough.

06:16.056 --> 06:18.726
Who's wearing the cape? Caleb?

06:20.034 --> 06:21.392
I have to take a shower.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.774
Has Caleb been tangling with Mona?

06:26.291 --> 06:27.367
"Tangling"?

06:27.574 --> 06:28.826
I don't even know what that means.

06:28.827 --> 06:31.083
Has Mona said anything to you recently,

06:31.084 --> 06:32.867
or done something to make...? No.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.095
He just doesn't trust her.

06:35.459 --> 06:37.113
He thinks she should be watched.

06:37.632 --> 06:39.703
You know, I-I think I am
gonna call Mr. Tamborelli.

06:39.704 --> 06:42.733
Don't. I can deal with Mona and Caleb.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.932
Just... leave it alone.

06:50.898 --> 06:52.856
I'm glad to hear that
you're getting her help.

06:53.237 --> 06:56.123
Like I said, I just hope that
she makes a full recovery,

06:56.204 --> 06:58.754
and I know that my daughter
feels the same way.

07:00.810 --> 07:01.696
Thank you.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.685
You too, Mr. Sorenson.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.495
Well, I just got off the phone
with Meredith's father.

07:15.069 --> 07:17.362
Wow. That must have been weird.

07:17.724 --> 07:20.922
Turns out Meredith has a long history of...

07:21.835 --> 07:22.848
Issues.

07:23.481 --> 07:25.911
He thinks that she stopped taking her meds,

07:27.524 --> 07:30.157
and I told him that we didn't
want to see her punished,

07:30.158 --> 07:31.956
we wanted to see her treated.

07:32.854 --> 07:35.165
That is still what you want, right?

07:35.201 --> 07:37.469
Yeah, but... can she be
treated in another state,

07:37.470 --> 07:39.892
like... Alaska?

07:43.430 --> 07:46.341
I won't let her anywhere near my family.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.778
She never should have
been in the first place.

08:07.490 --> 08:09.351
You know, when we first
moved into this house,

08:09.352 --> 08:11.582
we didn't have money for a furnace,

08:12.391 --> 08:16.524
and it was winter, so we
bundled you up in sweaters.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.126
You looked like this...

08:19.674 --> 08:21.568
Big ball of yarn,

08:21.822 --> 08:24.373
rolling from room to room.

08:27.010 --> 08:29.000
And we never used the fireplace,

08:30.090 --> 08:33.114
'cause I was scared that
we'd turn our backs

08:33.115 --> 08:35.145
and you'd get burned.

08:38.124 --> 08:41.245
I knew that my one job on
this earth was to make sure

08:41.246 --> 08:42.964
that you didn't get hurt.

08:49.745 --> 08:51.559
And I haven't done a very good job...

08:52.865 --> 08:53.765
Have I?

09:04.563 --> 09:05.929
Still recovering?

09:06.930 --> 09:08.352
From the anniversary dinner.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.471
Yeah. Yeah.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.902
Was he surprised?

09:12.341 --> 09:14.914
Mm-hmm. It was a really big surprise.

09:16.328 --> 09:18.334
Where were you last night?
Were you with Caleb?

09:18.428 --> 09:20.611
No, he's being really weird.

09:20.676 --> 09:21.927
Every time I try to make plans with him,

09:21.928 --> 09:24.307
he says he's busy, but he won't
tell me what he's doing.

09:24.308 --> 09:26.427
Why don't you just ask him? Be honest.

09:26.428 --> 09:30.025
Wow. It's like the world's
fattest man giving dieting tips.

09:30.026 --> 09:31.018
Hello! You're the one who's

09:31.019 --> 09:32.826
sitting on a secret the
size of the "natterhorn"!

09:32.827 --> 09:35.129
Okay, if you're talking
about Fitz and the kid,

09:35.520 --> 09:36.918
I'm gonna tell him today.

09:37.094 --> 09:39.187
And the goal was never to keep it from him.

09:39.188 --> 09:41.531
I-I'd wake up every morning with
the intention of telling him,

09:41.532 --> 09:44.033
and then I'd go to sleep every night
feeling guilty that I didn't.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.792
At least you have your afternoons free.

09:46.402 --> 09:47.808
Nice bit of support, Hanna.

09:47.881 --> 09:50.592
Oh, and by the way, it's "matterhorn." Muh.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.525
Aren't you the one that's
supposed to be correcting her?

09:52.526 --> 09:53.358
What?

09:54.184 --> 09:55.329
hey, what's wrong with you?

09:55.330 --> 09:59.069
Uh, nothing. We didn't really
get much of an anniversary

09:59.070 --> 10:01.831
'cause Toby had to get up
early for work the next day.

10:01.832 --> 10:02.753
That sucks.

10:02.754 --> 10:04.423
Yeah, it does.

10:04.424 --> 10:07.088
Listen, um, I'm gonna skip the brew today

10:07.089 --> 10:09.197
'cause I have a lot of
reading to catch up on,

10:09.198 --> 10:11.795
for English, so I'll
catch you guys at lunch.

10:17.359 --> 10:18.886
Hey, em. Hey.

10:18.887 --> 10:20.237
So, can we see it?

10:20.532 --> 10:21.938
The stuff from his family?

10:22.388 --> 10:23.493
Look, if it's, like,

10:23.494 --> 10:25.231
cards and stuff you wrote to Ali,

10:25.232 --> 10:27.182
you don't have to show us. It's fine.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.761
So, did Spencer tell you about
the key that I dropped?

10:34.762 --> 10:36.115
No, Hanna did.

10:36.116 --> 10:38.450
Said you guys want to
turn it in to the cops...?

10:39.202 --> 10:40.289
So, what do you think?

10:40.290 --> 10:42.041
I think that the mold from my basement

10:42.042 --> 10:43.816
killed some of your brain cells.

10:43.885 --> 10:46.562
Guys, we are not prepared
to tell the cops about "A."

10:47.006 --> 10:48.148
I guess you're right.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.469
Mnh. I always hated biology.

10:50.470 --> 10:53.180
Who cares how a cell divides? It just does.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.271
I didn't know that you and
Ali were in bio together.

10:55.272 --> 10:56.280
We weren't.

10:56.301 --> 10:58.688
I lent her my notes to study for the exam.

10:58.887 --> 11:01.052
Then how'd you have the
time to write these?

11:04.308 --> 11:06.548
This is definitely Alison's handwriting.

11:06.549 --> 11:08.267
Yeah, but that's not mine.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.575
Wait. Who's "the beach hottie"?

11:11.576 --> 11:12.518
What?

11:12.519 --> 11:15.003
"You need to tell the
beach hottie tonight."

11:15.004 --> 11:16.557
Then Ali says, "no way, he'll freak out."

11:16.558 --> 11:17.473
What are they talking about?

11:17.474 --> 11:19.840
I want to know who they're talking about.
Turn the page.

11:20.256 --> 11:22.526
That's not Spencer's writing, either.

11:22.678 --> 11:23.544
But I recognize it.

11:23.545 --> 11:24.754
Who does their "g's" like that?

11:24.755 --> 11:25.998
My grandma.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.888
Forget the "g." Look at the "t."

11:28.596 --> 11:30.515
There's someone in here that we do know.

11:32.894 --> 11:34.996
Why is Alison writing about Toby?

11:45.044 --> 11:46.671
If you'll be home I around two P.M.

11:46.672 --> 11:48.167
I've got a free period after lunch

11:48.168 --> 11:52.062
and wanted to stop by so we could talk.

11:52.861 --> 11:54.875
Uh, call me. Love you.

11:56.368 --> 11:58.433
Just go now. Meet him there.

11:58.434 --> 12:00.128
Sooner you do it, the better you'll feel.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.720
Just don't know what else it's gonna take.

12:09.870 --> 12:11.771
You stuck a wet brain in her locker.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.634
She still showed up the next
day with a smile on her face.

12:16.310 --> 12:17.909
Fine. I'll figure it out.

12:18.555 --> 12:21.017
Caleb, I just said I'll do it.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.682
I'll be there around seven.

12:23.959 --> 12:26.037
It's off route 6. I know it.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.209
Hey. I been looking for you.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.512
Did you get my text?

12:37.743 --> 12:39.006
Uh, yeah.

12:40.328 --> 12:41.716
Yeah, you said that you found some of.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.553
Ali's writing in an old notebook?

12:43.554 --> 12:45.751
It's an entire conversation
between Ali and a friend,

12:45.752 --> 12:48.318
but none of us recognize
the friend's handwriting.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.533
Sorry.

12:54.366 --> 12:56.701
I have to get to class. You don't get it.

12:56.771 --> 12:58.924
Ali wasn't sharing makeup
tips with this person.

12:58.925 --> 12:59.570
They were talking about

12:59.571 --> 13:01.906
a guy that Ali was secretly involved with.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.617
They call him the beach hottie.

13:04.396 --> 13:05.739
Was Ian ever a lifeguard?

13:05.740 --> 13:08.547
I don't know, but Melissa might. Okay?

13:08.548 --> 13:10.746
Sorry, em, I've really got to get to class.

13:11.238 --> 13:12.137
Spencer...

13:12.741 --> 13:14.484
Ali was scared of this guy,

13:14.485 --> 13:16.136
or at least scared to tell him something.

13:16.137 --> 13:17.936
Okay, well, good luck figuring it out.

13:17.937 --> 13:19.342
What?! Maybe she was just scared

13:19.343 --> 13:20.925
to tell him that she was slutting it up

13:20.926 --> 13:23.181
in three different zip codes in one summer.

13:23.182 --> 13:24.221
What are you saying?

13:24.222 --> 13:26.100
I'm saying that Ali wasn't loyal.

13:26.148 --> 13:27.538
To any of us.

13:27.818 --> 13:30.160
So why do we continue to be loyal to her?

13:30.275 --> 13:33.090
I mean, why should we
care what happens to her?

13:34.544 --> 13:36.173
What happened to her?

13:36.954 --> 13:38.192
Because we do.

13:38.703 --> 13:39.624
Care.

13:43.191 --> 13:45.045
I think that I need to learn to stop.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.055
Wait.

13:47.877 --> 13:48.603
Read.

14:02.162 --> 14:05.544
Alison visited Toby after
he was shipped off to juvie

14:15.632 --> 14:18.027
what is this? You know exactly what it is.

14:18.028 --> 14:20.016
It's time to quit the pen pal routine.

14:20.017 --> 14:20.740
What?

14:20.741 --> 14:22.627
Clearly your time in cellblock four

14:22.628 --> 14:25.376
has done great things for
your literary skills,

14:25.377 --> 14:27.135
but this needs to stop.

14:32.242 --> 14:33.768
I didn't write these.

14:36.163 --> 14:37.063
Listen.

14:37.698 --> 14:38.915
I drove all the way up here

14:38.916 --> 14:41.799
and just got a triple-x
pat down by security.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.609
The least you can do is save me
the trouble of being lied to.

14:44.610 --> 14:47.016
Why are you so convinced that it's me?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.855
Pretty sure Jenna would love
to see your head on a stick.

14:49.856 --> 14:53.070
Jenna would be pretty happy
to see anything, I imagine.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.721
Your step-sis was going through surgery

14:55.722 --> 14:57.592
when some of these were sent.

14:58.354 --> 15:00.032
You wanna know how it turned out?

15:00.452 --> 15:03.922
She's still combing her hair
with an electric toothbrush.

15:05.226 --> 15:06.566
You can go now.

15:11.250 --> 15:14.000
You know, I wasn't the only
one outside that garage.

15:14.001 --> 15:15.531
Why aren't you harassing my friends?

15:15.532 --> 15:16.681
You know what?

15:17.424 --> 15:19.711
I wish I knew who wrote those notes.

15:19.712 --> 15:21.654
I'd offer my services.

15:21.724 --> 15:24.634
You and your posse deserve a lot worse.

15:25.519 --> 15:28.149
I bet you wish you'd kissed
me when you had the chance.

15:40.594 --> 15:41.504
You okay?

15:44.640 --> 15:45.794
Spence, what's wrong?

15:47.453 --> 15:50.347
You're not upset because Ali tried
to hook up with Toby, are you?

15:50.936 --> 15:52.097
Who even knows if she did?

15:52.098 --> 15:54.048
Just because she wrote
it down doesn't mean...

15:54.662 --> 15:56.996
I-I haven't told you guys the truth?

15:59.106 --> 16:01.624
What do you mean? What truth?

16:03.076 --> 16:05.059
That Toby and I broke up

16:05.060 --> 16:05.992
last night.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.571
You did?

16:09.734 --> 16:10.706
What happened?

16:14.220 --> 16:16.141
I'm not really ready to talk about it.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.299
Can we... please just keep it between us?

16:19.300 --> 16:20.260
Yeah.

16:21.325 --> 16:22.346
Thanks.

16:29.112 --> 16:30.006
It's just not that simple.

16:30.007 --> 16:31.857
I mean, she became part of a group.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.173
They influenced her.

16:33.174 --> 16:35.125
I think she just called
him out to punish him.

16:35.126 --> 16:36.069
Well, maybe at first, sure,

16:36.070 --> 16:39.491
but I think she really started
to believe in her own lie.

16:52.838 --> 16:53.694
Spencer.

16:54.845 --> 16:55.879
Are you all right?

16:56.160 --> 16:58.087
Spencer. I need to go!

16:58.088 --> 17:00.358
Go where? Home.

17:00.834 --> 17:01.761
Is something wrong?

17:01.762 --> 17:04.143
Do you want me to call your mom? For what?

17:04.815 --> 17:05.863
You can't just storm out

17:05.864 --> 17:08.214
of the classroom without
a legitimate excuse.

17:08.215 --> 17:09.547
I don't want to be here anymore.

17:09.548 --> 17:11.083
Is that legitimate enough?

17:11.084 --> 17:12.462
What is going on with you?

17:12.463 --> 17:13.699
I don't need to sit in a room

17:13.700 --> 17:16.728
and read books about made-up
people who've been screwed over.

17:16.729 --> 17:18.086
Okay, I get it.

17:18.087 --> 17:19.730
It's not gonna prepare me for
what I have to deal with

17:19.731 --> 17:20.993
when I walk out of this building.

17:20.994 --> 17:23.201
It is a complete waste of my time!

17:36.750 --> 17:37.518
Hey.

17:37.996 --> 17:39.511
Enjoying a nice day in the park?

17:39.512 --> 17:41.653
Oh. Spencer. I didn't even see you, uh...

17:41.654 --> 17:44.532
Been writing down all of
your thoughts and feelings?

17:44.914 --> 17:46.726
Um... actually, I was
working on this, um...

17:46.727 --> 17:49.149
How could you do that to her?

17:51.394 --> 17:52.295
I'm sorry, I-I-I...

17:52.296 --> 17:54.158
no, don't apologize to me.

17:54.598 --> 17:56.852
My God, not after the way
that you've treated her.

17:57.263 --> 18:00.021
Do you even get how much she loves you?

18:00.106 --> 18:02.153
Do you think that it's easy to
find out a secret like that?

18:02.154 --> 18:04.907
Because it's not, okay? It's a burden.

18:04.908 --> 18:05.627
I mean, you're screwed

18:05.628 --> 18:07.268
if you tell and you're
screwed if you don't,

18:07.269 --> 18:10.153
and if you really want to get
pissed and take it out on somebody,

18:10.154 --> 18:11.701
don't dump it on Aria, okay?

18:11.702 --> 18:13.681
No, go after Maggie, because she's actually

18:13.682 --> 18:14.767
the person who had your son

18:14.768 --> 18:17.454
and then kept it a secret for seven years!

18:18.412 --> 18:19.946
What are you talking about?

18:25.003 --> 18:26.737
I thought... I thought, um...

18:27.932 --> 18:30.922
I thought that Aria had told you, and...

18:31.830 --> 18:33.889
Did you not have this conversation?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.853
What... conversation?

18:36.854 --> 18:39.388
What... what are you talking about?

18:40.682 --> 18:42.584
I need to... I need to go.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.010
No, Spencer, wait.

19:00.610 --> 19:03.149
Oh. Thank you. No problem.

19:03.150 --> 19:04.306
How's the family?

19:04.438 --> 19:05.898
Mm, everyone's good, you know?

19:05.899 --> 19:09.195
My husband's back in Texas
on base, in training,

19:09.196 --> 19:10.858
and Emily's...

19:12.110 --> 19:13.364
You know, she's okay.

19:14.084 --> 19:14.825
Good.

19:14.826 --> 19:16.535
Hey, can I ask you something?

19:17.547 --> 19:19.577
Emily got a package yesterday

19:19.601 --> 19:23.839
from the family of the kid
who killed Maya St. Germain.

19:24.608 --> 19:26.903
Should I be worried that
they have our address?

19:26.904 --> 19:28.822
They shouldn't be contacting you at all.

19:30.010 --> 19:31.322
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

19:31.323 --> 19:35.618
No, please. This kind of thing's
much more his territory than mine.

19:36.220 --> 19:37.869
If you want, we can ask that his family

19:37.870 --> 19:40.516
send any future correspondence
directly to us,

19:40.596 --> 19:42.258
let us run interference.

19:42.428 --> 19:44.250
Thanks. I'll think about that.

20:23.684 --> 20:25.780
Hey, you seen Spencer?

20:25.781 --> 20:28.332
Mmm, no, not since this morning.

20:28.512 --> 20:30.097
Everyone said she bailed
on her study group.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.657
She just walked out of class.

20:32.128 --> 20:33.677
Hey. Hey.

20:46.509 --> 20:47.717
Hey, what are you doing here?

20:47.718 --> 20:49.236
Could I see you for a moment?

20:50.566 --> 20:52.441
Sure, what's going on. Is everything okay?

20:52.442 --> 20:53.230
Okay?

20:53.810 --> 20:55.472
I don't know. You tell me.

20:56.029 --> 20:58.139
Why was Spencer talking about Maggie?

20:58.171 --> 20:59.092
What?

20:59.706 --> 21:01.240
She said that I had...

21:02.708 --> 21:03.914
That I have a son.

21:04.815 --> 21:06.229
Why would she say that?

21:07.358 --> 21:08.129
Look, can we just talk about this...

21:08.130 --> 21:11.199
we're talking about this right now.
Ezra, please.

21:23.225 --> 21:25.462
Y-you've been holding onto
this since my birthday?

21:25.463 --> 21:26.800
Ezra... so, what, you and my brother...

21:26.801 --> 21:28.542
Just sat there watching
me blow out candles,

21:28.543 --> 21:30.821
and you couldn't find a
way to tell me this?

21:30.822 --> 21:33.437
I was scared. Of? Of
what it might do to us.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.082
And then Maggie showed up,

21:35.083 --> 21:35.658
and I thought that she

21:35.659 --> 21:37.171
was going to tell you,
and when she didn't...

21:37.172 --> 21:39.881
Maggie hasn't been a part of
my life since high school.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.831
I see you every day, Aria. You.

21:43.906 --> 21:45.669
You are the person I'm
spending my life with.

21:45.670 --> 21:48.110
You are the person I'm supposed to trust.

21:51.445 --> 21:52.393
You're right.

22:44.439 --> 22:45.367
You know, when I was growing up here,

22:45.368 --> 22:46.808
they could have put up a sign:

22:47.316 --> 22:50.409
"Welcome to Rosewood,
where nothing happens."

22:52.258 --> 22:53.589
But in these past few years...

22:53.590 --> 22:56.387
Detective Wilden, if you're asking
if we're considering moving...

22:56.388 --> 22:57.273
I wouldn't blame you.

22:58.167 --> 22:59.909
There are days when I
wish I could leave too.

23:01.429 --> 23:03.006
But no matter how far I went,

23:03.529 --> 23:05.727
I'd still be taking so
many questions with me.

23:09.335 --> 23:10.510
You know, you may not believe this,

23:10.511 --> 23:12.475
but I know exactly what
Emily's going through.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.470
I'm not following you.

23:15.017 --> 23:16.579
What happened out at that lighthouse,

23:17.618 --> 23:20.342
it's not really something any
young person can process.

23:21.062 --> 23:22.946
Even when it's self-defense.

23:24.941 --> 23:25.951
But uh...

23:27.361 --> 23:29.660
It haunts you. Forever.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.265
I can't really get her
to talk about it much.

23:35.442 --> 23:36.602
Well, I didn't either.

23:38.615 --> 23:39.661
Talk about it.

23:40.779 --> 23:42.225
My second week out of the academy,

23:42.226 --> 23:43.708
I had to defend myself.

23:44.237 --> 23:45.374
The way they taught me.

23:46.197 --> 23:48.858
But that doesn't make watching
someone die any easier.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.734
I was too ashamed to discuss it.

23:53.921 --> 23:56.054
In the law's eyes, I was
clearly in the right.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.230
But having to watch
someone leave this world,

24:02.259 --> 24:04.192
even someone who deserves to be punished...

24:06.707 --> 24:09.252
So when did you finally decide
to start talking about it?

24:11.869 --> 24:12.819
Just now.

24:45.196 --> 24:46.026
Hey.

24:46.835 --> 24:47.731
Hey.

24:49.373 --> 24:50.812
Tried calling you.

24:52.627 --> 24:54.898
Sorry, I shut my phone off.

24:54.899 --> 24:57.380
Yeah, well, you didn't
come back today to school.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.694
My mom said she might call your parents.
I figured.

25:00.695 --> 25:02.704
I don't think she wants to. I just think...

25:02.705 --> 25:04.952
whatever. It's okay. I
won't hold it against her.

25:08.027 --> 25:09.950
Anyway, it's not really why you came.

25:10.653 --> 25:11.676
Well...

25:13.247 --> 25:14.281
No.

25:14.737 --> 25:16.565
I wanted to talk to you...

25:16.566 --> 25:18.795
I know that I shouldn't
have said anything to Fitz.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.144
Okay, I know that.

25:21.017 --> 25:23.444
So, can we please just
skip ahead to the end?

25:24.964 --> 25:25.484
Sorry?

25:25.485 --> 25:27.495
Could we just fast-forward to the part

25:27.496 --> 25:29.268
where you scream or you cry

25:29.269 --> 25:31.472
or just do whatever you need to do, okay?

25:31.473 --> 25:34.176
Wait, I-I didn't come here
to punish you, Spencer.

25:34.177 --> 25:35.476
I know that you were set up.

25:36.653 --> 25:39.580
"A" sent me a text to rub it in
my face right after Ezra left.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.729
I think that we should stop blaming "a"

25:41.730 --> 25:43.397
for everything that goes
wrong in our lives,

25:43.398 --> 25:45.196
and start blaming ourselves.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.420
Whoa.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.259
Are you actually defending
our enemy right now?

25:50.260 --> 25:52.899
No, I'm just saying that maybe
if we stopped telling lies,

25:52.900 --> 25:55.286
maybe "a" wouldn't have a reason
to keep on exposing them.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.059
"A" isn't some tough-love
life coach, Spencer.

25:58.331 --> 25:59.018
We're not being taught

25:59.019 --> 26:00.474
to mind our manners and eat our vegetables.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.859
This person wants to hurt us.

26:02.341 --> 26:03.468
Maybe we deserve it.

26:05.631 --> 26:06.888
Unbelievable.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.330
And thanks for your concern, by the way.

26:11.331 --> 26:13.253
I'm... I'm doing just fine.

26:22.767 --> 26:24.540
Wow. This is crazy.

26:25.922 --> 26:27.594
I totally remember this.

26:27.827 --> 26:29.857
We were stuck in the car
with Ali's parents,

26:29.858 --> 26:32.461
two hours from shore, and
our phones were dead.

26:32.462 --> 26:33.307
It was brutal.

26:35.063 --> 26:38.036
So... who was the "beach hottie"?

26:38.037 --> 26:39.323
Mm, I have no idea.

26:40.095 --> 26:41.489
But you were writing about him.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.016
I just knew him by that name.

26:43.017 --> 26:44.973
Ali never told me who he was.

26:45.483 --> 26:46.997
So you never even met him?

26:47.167 --> 26:48.756
Well, I mean, I probably did.

26:49.010 --> 26:51.504
Honestly, there were so many
hotties down there that summer.

26:52.806 --> 26:55.477
But Ali was being really sketchy about it.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.785
I just assumed he was
seeing her on the side.

26:57.786 --> 26:59.533
He probably had a girlfriend or something.

27:00.949 --> 27:02.273
Would Jason know this person?

27:02.274 --> 27:04.308
If he did, he would have made him sorry

27:04.309 --> 27:05.864
he ever looked at his little sister.

27:06.395 --> 27:07.131
Why?

27:14.635 --> 27:17.051
Will somebody call Jason and
tell him to leave his weed

27:17.052 --> 27:18.485
and come meet up with us.

27:27.955 --> 27:29.348
What are you doing here?

27:29.588 --> 27:30.806
I needed to talk to you.

27:31.041 --> 27:31.973
What's wrong?

27:33.470 --> 27:34.700
I think I'm in trouble.

27:35.274 --> 27:36.361
What do you mean?

27:37.884 --> 27:38.852
I'm late.

27:40.708 --> 27:41.285
Like...?

27:41.286 --> 27:42.179
Yeah.

27:42.180 --> 27:43.520
You mean you weren't using protection?

27:43.521 --> 27:46.125
We were. Just not all the time.

27:46.759 --> 27:48.157
Okay, how late are you?

27:49.523 --> 27:50.406
Two weeks.

27:50.675 --> 27:51.961
Have you ever been late before?

27:55.539 --> 27:57.122
What am I gonna do?

27:59.269 --> 28:00.710
Have you told him?

28:00.974 --> 28:02.013
I can't.

28:02.660 --> 28:04.731
If he finds out, he's gonna kill me.

28:13.886 --> 28:14.948
Ali was...

28:16.243 --> 28:17.972
Listen, I'm not a doctor, em,

28:17.973 --> 28:20.433
but... she thought that she was.

28:21.197 --> 28:21.866
It's like I said...

28:21.867 --> 28:23.728
it was an intense couple of weeks.

28:41.277 --> 28:42.515
Hey. What are you doing?

28:42.800 --> 28:46.659
Right now? Following Paige. What?

28:46.660 --> 28:49.270
She's the one who's been working
with Caleb to bring down Mona.

28:49.271 --> 28:50.812
I'm trying to bust them before "a" does.

28:50.813 --> 28:52.256
Wait, when did you find this out?

28:52.257 --> 28:53.249
Before lunch.

28:53.736 --> 28:55.429
I was gonna tell you, but Ezra...

28:55.430 --> 28:56.098
Right.

28:57.646 --> 28:58.778
Hanna, be careful.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.562
I-I gotta go. I'll call you later.

29:00.563 --> 29:01.296
Bye.

29:01.676 --> 29:02.425
Bye.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.813
What is this?

30:40.055 --> 30:41.483
Raspberry flirtini.

30:43.033 --> 30:44.744
Thank you, but I didn't order this.

30:44.745 --> 30:47.325
I know. She ordered it for you.

31:12.667 --> 31:13.355
Hey.

31:14.274 --> 31:15.240
Hey.

31:17.831 --> 31:20.035
You've been on that couch a while.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.888
How 'bout I make my fancy grilled cheese?

31:29.252 --> 31:30.292
Yeah.

31:43.908 --> 31:44.718
If she were pregnant,

31:44.719 --> 31:45.997
wouldn't that kind of
thing show up on her...

31:46.986 --> 31:48.031
Autopsy?

31:48.191 --> 31:49.457
Not necessarily.

31:50.215 --> 31:51.384
I looked online, and...

31:52.868 --> 31:54.141
If it was really early on,

31:55.477 --> 31:59.163
she was buried over a year ago, so...

32:02.865 --> 32:03.941
What shall we do now?

32:04.813 --> 32:05.823
I don't know.

32:07.171 --> 32:09.483
But look, if some guy in cape
may did get her pregnant

32:09.484 --> 32:11.515
and then threatened to
kill her if he found out,

32:12.720 --> 32:14.279
this is a lot bigger than a key.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.007
This needs to be turned over to the police.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.017
I was worried you were gonna say that.

32:19.810 --> 32:20.656
But I agree.

32:21.980 --> 32:23.263
I'll take you down to the station.

32:23.264 --> 32:24.329
Then I'm coming with you.

32:24.330 --> 32:26.549
No, that's okay. I won't be alone.

32:26.550 --> 32:27.536
My mom will be there.

32:28.167 --> 32:29.112
I'll call you later.

32:29.825 --> 32:30.419
Okay.

32:42.249 --> 32:43.181
I miss you.

32:43.506 --> 32:45.201
And if they play the uncut version of this,

32:45.202 --> 32:46.202
then I'd have to kiss you.

32:46.459 --> 32:48.609
Hey, ladies, shots are a dollar

32:48.610 --> 32:50.437
if you holler in the next half hour,

32:50.438 --> 32:53.158
so step up and get 'em while
they're hot, hot, hot!

33:01.682 --> 33:04.603
Hi. I hope you don't mind. I
just really love this song.

33:18.269 --> 33:20.742
Who is this peroxide piece of trash?

33:20.743 --> 33:21.845
Hey, watch it!

33:31.646 --> 33:33.119
Can I see your I.D.?

33:35.770 --> 33:37.061
Why would the police want this?

33:37.323 --> 33:39.963
I don't know. Um, Ali wrote in it.

33:40.488 --> 33:41.353
Maybe there's something in there

33:41.354 --> 33:43.561
that could help them figure out
who would want to hurt her.

33:44.874 --> 33:46.971
Okay, let me find out who to give this to.

35:18.966 --> 35:19.594
Hanna?

35:21.630 --> 35:23.491
Hi. What are you doing here?

35:24.566 --> 35:26.417
What's that smell? Is that... Tequila?

35:26.418 --> 35:28.308
No. It's actually gin.

35:29.926 --> 35:31.818
A little bit got in my mouth

35:31.819 --> 35:34.088
when, uh, the girl threw
it in my face, so...

35:34.089 --> 35:35.650
Who did? What happened?

35:36.740 --> 35:37.647
Nothing. I just...

35:37.762 --> 35:39.523
I got busted for underage drinking,

35:39.741 --> 35:41.119
which I wasn't even doing.

35:41.687 --> 35:43.576
Unfortunately, "I'm just holding it"

35:43.577 --> 35:45.368
doesn't work on Betty the bouncer.

35:45.369 --> 35:46.387
You were at a club.

35:46.873 --> 35:48.501
More of a bar. What bar?

35:48.741 --> 35:49.858
Oh, it was more of a club.

35:50.109 --> 35:51.294
You wouldn't have heard of it.

35:53.072 --> 35:54.500
My mom's gonna kill me.

35:56.346 --> 35:58.209
Hey, Emily. Hanna.

35:59.799 --> 36:00.869
I just spoke with your mom.

36:00.870 --> 36:02.370
She said you wanted to turn something in?

36:04.791 --> 36:06.719
What are you doing? The
cops need to see that.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.560
Unfortunately, he's one of 'em.

36:09.827 --> 36:11.458
I appreciate you bringing this down.

36:11.978 --> 36:13.413
We'll return it to you as soon as we can.

36:16.380 --> 36:17.199
Oh, and Emily,

36:18.271 --> 36:19.451
you did the right thing.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.723
What are you thinking?

36:22.943 --> 36:24.586
I'm thinking we could end this.

36:26.529 --> 36:28.033
I'm gonna get a coffee. Do you want one?

36:28.034 --> 36:29.026
No thanks.

36:29.202 --> 36:31.460
I'll take a napkin, for blotting.

36:38.577 --> 36:39.408
What's wrong?

36:41.643 --> 36:43.205
Look who else was in cape may.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.985
I didn't know if you
were really gonna show.

37:13.940 --> 37:14.840
Why wouldn't I?

37:17.274 --> 37:18.465
Said you were 18, right?

37:22.184 --> 37:23.235
So...

37:25.702 --> 37:26.927
How does this work?

37:27.886 --> 37:28.649
Well...

37:31.874 --> 37:32.840
This works...

37:32.841 --> 37:35.022
Whichever way you want it to work.

37:36.179 --> 37:37.216
You called me.

37:43.907 --> 37:45.550
I'm sensing some hesitation here.

37:55.828 --> 37:57.138
What does this go to?

37:57.449 --> 37:58.984
That's what I would like you to find out.

38:02.797 --> 38:04.838
And if you follow him...

38:06.229 --> 38:07.315
He'll lead you there.

38:09.307 --> 38:10.035
Wait.

38:24.626 --> 38:25.796
I'll be in touch.

38:46.441 --> 38:47.532
Hold it.

38:48.692 --> 38:50.284
Can I at least shower first?

38:50.285 --> 38:52.292
My hair is about to crack off my head.

38:52.541 --> 38:54.268
I'm not going to bed
without discussing this.

38:54.269 --> 38:56.349
What were you doing in that bar? Mom.

38:57.074 --> 39:00.632
Was it about... exploring a new feeling?

39:00.633 --> 39:03.403
Okay, I wasn't looking for romance.
I was looking for Caleb.

39:03.404 --> 39:05.562
What would Caleb be doing
hanging out in a lesbian bar?

39:05.563 --> 39:07.724
I didn't know it was ladies'
night until I got there.

39:08.170 --> 39:09.364
Look, I was following Paige

39:09.365 --> 39:10.558
because I thought he was
meeting up with her.

39:10.559 --> 39:11.315
For what?

39:11.549 --> 39:13.574
A plan to keep Mona away from my friends.

39:14.412 --> 39:15.779
He and Paige don't want her near us,

39:15.780 --> 39:18.450
so I was just gonna stop them
from doing anything stupid.

39:18.451 --> 39:21.156
And that required ordering a
cocktail and starting a bar fight?

39:21.157 --> 39:22.661
I did not order a cocktail,

39:22.662 --> 39:23.779
and I only danced with

39:23.780 --> 39:25.416
that girl who thought I
was into pink drinks

39:25.417 --> 39:27.166
because I didn't want Paige to see me.

39:28.189 --> 39:29.171
What's a pink drink?

39:29.767 --> 39:31.508
Is that code for something gay?

39:31.509 --> 39:33.138
No, it's just a pink drink.

39:33.139 --> 39:34.524
Can we not do this right now?

39:35.690 --> 39:37.863
Hanna, we're getting to that place again.

39:38.119 --> 39:38.733
What place?

39:38.734 --> 39:41.388
Where I'm sensing you're not
telling me the whole truth.

39:41.389 --> 39:43.419
Well, I'm not hiding
anything from you, okay?

39:44.254 --> 39:46.326
I was just making sure Caleb
didn't get into trouble.

39:46.327 --> 39:48.198
And you got yourself into trouble instead.

39:48.199 --> 39:49.235
Well, that wasn't the plan.

39:49.995 --> 39:52.359
And, honestly, if it keeps
Emily from being messed with,

39:52.583 --> 39:53.764
maybe it was worth it.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.797
What does Emily have to do with this?

39:57.889 --> 40:00.229
Paige might not be a one-girl kind of girl.

40:01.359 --> 40:04.260
She was hooking up with someone
there, and Emily has no clue.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.289
Could I make a suggestion?

40:07.084 --> 40:08.012
Stay out of it.

40:10.209 --> 40:12.083
And use the hot oil treatment on your hair.

40:32.550 --> 40:33.323
Hey.

40:34.550 --> 40:35.157
I was just...

40:35.921 --> 40:37.208
I thought that we were meeting
up at your apartment.

40:37.209 --> 40:38.475
No, we are. Uh...

40:39.016 --> 40:40.719
I was just putting a few things in the car.

40:41.293 --> 40:42.737
Can I just explain to you why...

40:42.738 --> 40:44.135
I don't need you to explain.

40:45.305 --> 40:47.314
I spoke with Maggie, and she told me

40:47.315 --> 40:48.659
that she asked you to keep quiet.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.438
And... she knows it was an
unfair position to put you in.

40:55.737 --> 40:56.759
So are we okay?

40:58.455 --> 40:59.329
Yeah.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.284
Are you okay?

41:04.743 --> 41:06.519
I don't even know how to begin

41:06.520 --> 41:07.786
to answer that question.

41:08.236 --> 41:10.395
Yeah. I understand. Good.

41:10.396 --> 41:11.849
Because I don't.

41:12.803 --> 41:16.187
There are, like, a million thoughts

41:16.188 --> 41:18.865
fighting in my head right now, and...

41:22.213 --> 41:23.664
I'm about to meet my son.

41:27.344 --> 41:28.656
But you're leaving?

41:30.188 --> 41:31.853
Yeah, tonight. How long?

41:32.473 --> 41:33.973
Uh, I don't know.

41:40.037 --> 41:41.362
Well, where are you staying tonight?

41:42.576 --> 41:43.402
Motel.

41:44.105 --> 41:45.470
I got a college buddy in the area

41:45.471 --> 41:47.467
that I can stay with tomorrow night.

41:48.620 --> 41:49.382
That's good.

41:50.380 --> 41:51.133
Yep.

41:53.152 --> 41:54.316
Can I call you?

41:58.326 --> 41:59.023
Ezra?

42:11.241 --> 42:11.946
Ezra?

42:15.696 --> 42:16.980
We'll talk soon, okay?

21:23.225 --> 21:25.462
Y-you've been holding onto
this since my birthday?

21:25.463 --> 21:26.800
Ezra... so, what, you and my brother...

21:26.801 --> 21:28.542
Just sat there watching
me blow out candles,

21:28.543 --> 21:30.821
and you couldn't find a
way to tell me this?

21:30.822 --> 21:33.437
I was scared. Of? Of
what it might do to us.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.082
And then Maggie showed up,

21:35.083 --> 21:35.658
and I thought that she

21:35.659 --> 21:37.171
was going to tell you,
and when she didn't...

21:37.172 --> 21:39.881
Maggie hasn't been a part of
my life since high school.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.831
I see you every day, Aria. You.

21:43.906 --> 21:45.669
You are the person I'm
spending my life with.

21:45.670 --> 21:48.110
You are the person I'm supposed to trust.

21:51.445 --> 21:52.393
You're right.

22:44.439 --> 22:45.367
You know, when I was growing up here,

22:45.368 --> 22:46.808
they could have put up a sign:

22:47.316 --> 22:50.409
"Welcome to Rosewood,
where nothing happens."

22:52.258 --> 22:53.589
But in these past few years...

22:53.590 --> 22:56.387
Detective Wilden, if you're asking
if we're considering moving...

22:56.388 --> 22:57.273
I wouldn't blame you.

22:58.167 --> 22:59.909
There are days when I
wish I could leave too.

23:01.429 --> 23:03.006
But no matter how far I went,

23:03.529 --> 23:05.727
I'd still be taking so
many questions with me.

23:09.335 --> 23:10.510
You know, you may not believe this,

23:10.511 --> 23:12.475
but I know exactly what
Emily's going through.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.470
I'm not following you.

23:15.017 --> 23:16.579
What happened out at that lighthouse,

23:17.618 --> 23:20.342
it's not really something any
young person can process.

23:21.062 --> 23:22.946
Even when it's self-defense.

23:24.941 --> 23:25.951
But uh...

23:27.361 --> 23:29.660
It haunts you. Forever.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.265
I can't really get her
to talk about it much.

23:35.442 --> 23:36.602
Well, I didn't either.

23:38.615 --> 23:39.661
Talk about it.

23:40.779 --> 23:42.225
My second week out of the academy,

23:42.226 --> 23:43.708
I had to defend myself.

23:44.237 --> 23:45.374
The way they taught me.

23:46.197 --> 23:48.858
But that doesn't make watching
someone die any easier.

23:50.655 --> 23:52.734
I was too ashamed to discuss it.

23:53.921 --> 23:56.054
In the law's eyes, I was
clearly in the right.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.230
But having to watch
someone leave this world,

24:02.259 --> 24:04.192
even someone who deserves to be punished...

24:06.707 --> 24:09.252
So when did you finally decide
to start talking about it?

24:11.869 --> 24:12.819
Just now.

24:45.196 --> 24:46.026
Hey.

24:46.835 --> 24:47.731
Hey.

24:49.373 --> 24:50.812
Tried calling you.

24:52.627 --> 24:54.898
Sorry, I shut my phone off.

24:54.899 --> 24:57.380
Yeah, well, you didn't
come back today to school.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.694
My mom said she might call your parents.
I figured.

25:00.695 --> 25:02.704
I don't think she wants to. I just think...

25:02.705 --> 25:04.952
whatever. It's okay. I
won't hold it against her.

25:08.027 --> 25:09.950
Anyway, it's not really why you came.

25:10.653 --> 25:11.676
Well...

25:13.247 --> 25:14.281
No.

25:14.737 --> 25:16.565
I wanted to talk to you...

25:16.566 --> 25:18.795
I know that I shouldn't
have said anything to Fitz.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.144
Okay, I know that.

25:21.017 --> 25:23.444
So, can we please just
skip ahead to the end?

25:24.964 --> 25:25.484
Sorry?

25:25.485 --> 25:27.495
Could we just fast-forward to the part

25:27.496 --> 25:29.268
where you scream or you cry

25:29.269 --> 25:31.472
or just do whatever you need to do, okay?

25:31.473 --> 25:34.176
Wait, I-I didn't come here
to punish you, Spencer.

25:34.177 --> 25:35.476
I know that you were set up.

25:36.653 --> 25:39.580
"A" sent me a text to rub it in
my face right after Ezra left.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.729
I think that we should stop blaming "a"

25:41.730 --> 25:43.397
for everything that goes
wrong in our lives,

25:43.398 --> 25:45.196
and start blaming ourselves.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.420
Whoa.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.259
Are you actually defending
our enemy right now?

25:50.260 --> 25:52.899
No, I'm just saying that maybe
if we stopped telling lies,

25:52.900 --> 25:55.286
maybe "a" wouldn't have a reason
to keep on exposing them.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.059
"A" isn't some tough-love
life coach, Spencer.

25:58.331 --> 25:59.018
We're not being taught

25:59.019 --> 26:00.474
to mind our manners and eat our vegetables.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.859
This person wants to hurt us.

26:02.341 --> 26:03.468
Maybe we deserve it.

26:05.631 --> 26:06.888
Unbelievable.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.330
And thanks for your concern, by the way.

26:11.331 --> 26:13.253
I'm... I'm doing just fine.

26:22.767 --> 26:24.540
Wow. This is crazy.

26:25.922 --> 26:27.594
I totally remember this.

26:27.827 --> 26:29.857
We were stuck in the car
with Ali's parents,

26:29.858 --> 26:32.461
two hours from shore, and
our phones were dead.

26:32.462 --> 26:33.307
It was brutal.

26:35.063 --> 26:38.036
So... who was the "beach hottie"?

26:38.037 --> 26:39.323
Mm, I have no idea.

26:40.095 --> 26:41.489
But you were writing about him.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.016
I just knew him by that name.

26:43.017 --> 26:44.973
Ali never told me who he was.

26:45.483 --> 26:46.997
So you never even met him?

26:47.167 --> 26:48.756
Well, I mean, I probably did.

26:49.010 --> 26:51.504
Honestly, there were so many
hotties down there that summer.

26:52.806 --> 26:55.477
But Ali was being really sketchy about it.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.785
I just assumed he was
seeing her on the side.

26:57.786 --> 26:59.533
He probably had a girlfriend or something.

27:00.949 --> 27:02.273
Would Jason know this person?

27:02.274 --> 27:04.308
If he did, he would have made him sorry

27:04.309 --> 27:05.864
he ever looked at his little sister.

27:06.395 --> 27:07.131
Why?

27:14.635 --> 27:17.051
Will somebody call Jason and
tell him to leave his weed

27:17.052 --> 27:18.485
and come meet up with us.

27:27.955 --> 27:29.348
What are you doing here?

27:29.588 --> 27:30.806
I needed to talk to you.

27:31.041 --> 27:31.973
What's wrong?

27:33.470 --> 27:34.700
I think I'm in trouble.

27:35.274 --> 27:36.361
What do you mean?

27:37.884 --> 27:38.852
I'm late.

27:40.708 --> 27:41.285
Like...?

27:41.286 --> 27:42.179
Yeah.

27:42.180 --> 27:43.520
You mean you weren't using protection?

27:43.521 --> 27:46.125
We were. Just not all the time.

27:46.759 --> 27:48.157
Okay, how late are you?

27:49.523 --> 27:50.406
Two weeks.

27:50.675 --> 27:51.961
Have you ever been late before?

27:55.539 --> 27:57.122
What am I gonna do?

27:59.269 --> 28:00.710
Have you told him?

28:00.974 --> 28:02.013
I can't.

28:02.660 --> 28:04.731
If he finds out, he's gonna kill me.

28:13.886 --> 28:14.948
Ali was...

28:16.243 --> 28:17.972
Listen, I'm not a doctor, em,

28:17.973 --> 28:20.433
but... she thought that she was.

28:21.197 --> 28:21.866
It's like I said...

28:21.867 --> 28:23.728
it was an intense couple of weeks.

28:41.277 --> 28:42.515
Hey. What are you doing?

28:42.800 --> 28:46.659
Right now? Following Paige. What?

28:46.660 --> 28:49.270
She's the one who's been working
with Caleb to bring down Mona.

28:49.271 --> 28:50.812
I'm trying to bust them before "a" does.

28:50.813 --> 28:52.256
Wait, when did you find this out?

28:52.257 --> 28:53.249
Before lunch.

28:53.736 --> 28:55.429
I was gonna tell you, but Ezra...

28:55.430 --> 28:56.098
Right.

28:57.646 --> 28:58.778
Hanna, be careful.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.562
I-I gotta go. I'll call you later.

29:00.563 --> 29:01.296
Bye.

29:01.676 --> 29:02.425
Bye.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.813
What is this?

30:40.055 --> 30:41.483
Raspberry flirtini.

30:43.033 --> 30:44.744
Thank you, but I didn't order this.

30:44.745 --> 30:47.325
I know. She ordered it for you.

31:12.667 --> 31:13.355
Hey.

31:14.274 --> 31:15.240
Hey.

31:17.831 --> 31:20.035
You've been on that couch a while.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.888
How 'bout I make my fancy grilled cheese?

31:29.252 --> 31:30.292
Yeah.

31:43.908 --> 31:44.718
If she were pregnant,

31:44.719 --> 31:45.997
wouldn't that kind of
thing show up on her...

31:46.986 --> 31:48.031
Autopsy?

31:48.191 --> 31:49.457
Not necessarily.

31:50.215 --> 31:51.384
I looked online, and...

31:52.868 --> 31:54.141
If it was really early on,

31:55.477 --> 31:59.163
she was buried over a year ago, so...

32:02.865 --> 32:03.941
What shall we do now?

32:04.813 --> 32:05.823
I don't know.

32:07.171 --> 32:09.483
But look, if some guy in cape
may did get her pregnant

32:09.484 --> 32:11.515
and then threatened to
kill her if he found out,

32:12.720 --> 32:14.279
this is a lot bigger than a key.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.007
This needs to be turned over to the police.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.017
I was worried you were gonna say that.

32:19.810 --> 32:20.656
But I agree.

32:21.980 --> 32:23.263
I'll take you down to the station.

32:23.264 --> 32:24.329
Then I'm coming with you.

32:24.330 --> 32:26.549
No, that's okay. I won't be alone.

32:26.550 --> 32:27.536
My mom will be there.

32:28.167 --> 32:29.112
I'll call you later.

32:29.825 --> 32:30.419
Okay.

32:42.249 --> 32:43.181
I miss you.

32:43.506 --> 32:45.201
And if they play the uncut version of this,

32:45.202 --> 32:46.202
then I'd have to kiss you.

32:46.459 --> 32:48.609
Hey, ladies, shots are a dollar

32:48.610 --> 32:50.437
if you holler in the next half hour,

32:50.438 --> 32:53.158
so step up and get 'em while
they're hot, hot, hot!

33:01.682 --> 33:04.603
Hi. I hope you don't mind. I
just really love this song.

33:18.269 --> 33:20.742
Who is this peroxide piece of trash?

33:20.743 --> 33:21.845
Hey, watch it!

33:31.646 --> 33:33.119
Can I see your I.D.?

33:35.770 --> 33:37.061
Why would the police want this?

33:37.323 --> 33:39.963
I don't know. Um, Ali wrote in it.

33:40.488 --> 33:41.353
Maybe there's something in there

33:41.354 --> 33:43.561
that could help them figure out
who would want to hurt her.

33:44.874 --> 33:46.971
Okay, let me find out who to give this to.

35:18.966 --> 35:19.594
Hanna?

35:21.630 --> 35:23.491
Hi. What are you doing here?

35:24.566 --> 35:26.417
What's that smell? Is that... Tequila?

35:26.418 --> 35:28.308
No. It's actually gin.

35:29.926 --> 35:31.818
A little bit got in my mouth

35:31.819 --> 35:34.088
when, uh, the girl threw
it in my face, so...

35:34.089 --> 35:35.650
Who did? What happened?

35:36.740 --> 35:37.647
Nothing. I just...

35:37.762 --> 35:39.523
I got busted for underage drinking,

35:39.741 --> 35:41.119
which I wasn't even doing.

35:41.687 --> 35:43.576
Unfortunately, "I'm just holding it"

35:43.577 --> 35:45.368
doesn't work on Betty the bouncer.

35:45.369 --> 35:46.387
You were at a club.

35:46.873 --> 35:48.501
More of a bar. What bar?

35:48.741 --> 35:49.858
Oh, it was more of a club.

35:50.109 --> 35:51.294
You wouldn't have heard of it.

35:53.072 --> 35:54.500
My mom's gonna kill me.

35:56.346 --> 35:58.209
Hey, Emily. Hanna.

35:59.799 --> 36:00.869
I just spoke with your mom.

36:00.870 --> 36:02.370
She said you wanted to turn something in?

36:04.791 --> 36:06.719
What are you doing? The
cops need to see that.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.560
Unfortunately, he's one of 'em.

36:09.827 --> 36:11.458
I appreciate you bringing this down.

36:11.978 --> 36:13.413
We'll return it to you as soon as we can.

36:16.380 --> 36:17.199
Oh, and Emily,

36:18.271 --> 36:19.451
you did the right thing.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.723
What are you thinking?

36:22.943 --> 36:24.586
I'm thinking we could end this.

36:26.529 --> 36:28.033
I'm gonna get a coffee. Do you want one?

36:28.034 --> 36:29.026
No thanks.

36:29.202 --> 36:31.460
I'll take a napkin, for blotting.

36:38.577 --> 36:39.408
What's wrong?

36:41.643 --> 36:43.205
Look who else was in cape may.

37:11.460 --> 37:12.985
I didn't know if you
were really gonna show.

37:13.940 --> 37:14.840
Why wouldn't I?

37:17.274 --> 37:18.465
Said you were 18, right?

37:22.184 --> 37:23.235
So...

37:25.702 --> 37:26.927
How does this work?

37:27.886 --> 37:28.649
Well...

37:31.874 --> 37:32.840
This works...

37:32.841 --> 37:35.022
Whichever way you want it to work.

37:36.179 --> 37:37.216
You called me.

37:43.907 --> 37:45.550
I'm sensing some hesitation here.

37:55.828 --> 37:57.138
What does this go to?

37:57.449 --> 37:58.984
That's what I would like you to find out.

38:02.797 --> 38:04.838
And if you follow him...

38:06.229 --> 38:07.315
He'll lead you there.

38:09.307 --> 38:10.035
Wait.

38:24.626 --> 38:25.796
I'll be in touch.

38:46.441 --> 38:47.532
Hold it.

38:48.692 --> 38:50.284
Can I at least shower first?

38:50.285 --> 38:52.292
My hair is about to crack off my head.

38:52.541 --> 38:54.268
I'm not going to bed
without discussing this.

38:54.269 --> 38:56.349
What were you doing in that bar? Mom.

38:57.074 --> 39:00.632
Was it about... exploring a new feeling?

39:00.633 --> 39:03.403
Okay, I wasn't looking for romance.
I was looking for Caleb.

39:03.404 --> 39:05.562
What would Caleb be doing
hanging out in a lesbian bar?

39:05.563 --> 39:07.724
I didn't know it was ladies'
night until I got there.

39:08.170 --> 39:09.364
Look, I was following Paige

39:09.365 --> 39:10.558
because I thought he was
meeting up with her.

39:10.559 --> 39:11.315
For what?

39:11.549 --> 39:13.574
A plan to keep Mona away from my friends.

39:14.412 --> 39:15.779
He and Paige don't want her near us,

39:15.780 --> 39:18.450
so I was just gonna stop them
from doing anything stupid.

39:18.451 --> 39:21.156
And that required ordering a
cocktail and starting a bar fight?

39:21.157 --> 39:22.661
I did not order a cocktail,

39:22.662 --> 39:23.779
and I only danced with

39:23.780 --> 39:25.416
that girl who thought I
was into pink drinks

39:25.417 --> 39:27.166
because I didn't want Paige to see me.

39:28.189 --> 39:29.171
What's a pink drink?

39:29.767 --> 39:31.508
Is that code for something gay?

39:31.509 --> 39:33.138
No, it's just a pink drink.

39:33.139 --> 39:34.524
Can we not do this right now?

39:35.690 --> 39:37.863
Hanna, we're getting to that place again.

39:38.119 --> 39:38.733
What place?

39:38.734 --> 39:41.388
Where I'm sensing you're not
telling me the whole truth.

39:41.389 --> 39:43.419
Well, I'm not hiding
anything from you, okay?

39:44.254 --> 39:46.326
I was just making sure Caleb
didn't get into trouble.

39:46.327 --> 39:48.198
And you got yourself into trouble instead.

39:48.199 --> 39:49.235
Well, that wasn't the plan.

39:49.995 --> 39:52.359
And, honestly, if it keeps
Emily from being messed with,

39:52.583 --> 39:53.764
maybe it was worth it.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.797
What does Emily have to do with this?

39:57.889 --> 40:00.229
Paige might not be a one-girl kind of girl.

40:01.359 --> 40:04.260
She was hooking up with someone
there, and Emily has no clue.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.289
Could I make a suggestion?

40:07.084 --> 40:08.012
Stay out of it.

40:10.209 --> 40:12.083
And use the hot oil treatment on your hair.

40:32.550 --> 40:33.323
Hey.

40:34.550 --> 40:35.157
I was just...

40:35.921 --> 40:37.208
I thought that we were meeting
up at your apartment.

40:37.209 --> 40:38.475
No, we are. Uh...

40:39.016 --> 40:40.719
I was just putting a few things in the car.

40:41.293 --> 40:42.737
Can I just explain to you why...

40:42.738 --> 40:44.135
I don't need you to explain.

40:45.305 --> 40:47.314
I spoke with Maggie, and she told me

40:47.315 --> 40:48.659
that she asked you to keep quiet.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.438
And... she knows it was an
unfair position to put you in.

40:55.737 --> 40:56.759
So are we okay?

40:58.455 --> 40:59.329
Yeah.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.284
Are you okay?

41:04.743 --> 41:06.519
I don't even know how to begin

41:06.520 --> 41:07.786
to answer that question.

41:08.236 --> 41:10.395
Yeah. I understand. Good.

41:10.396 --> 41:11.849
Because I don't.

41:12.803 --> 41:16.187
There are, like, a million thoughts

41:16.188 --> 41:18.865
fighting in my head right now, and...

41:22.213 --> 41:23.664
I'm about to meet my son.

41:27.344 --> 41:28.656
But you're leaving?

41:30.188 --> 41:31.853
Yeah, tonight. How long?

41:32.473 --> 41:33.973
Uh, I don't know.

41:40.037 --> 41:41.362
Well, where are you staying tonight?

41:42.576 --> 41:43.402
Motel.

41:44.105 --> 41:45.470
I got a college buddy in the area

41:45.471 --> 41:47.467
that I can stay with tomorrow night.

41:48.620 --> 41:49.382
That's good.

41:50.380 --> 41:51.133
Yep.

41:53.152 --> 41:54.316
Can I call you?

41:58.326 --> 41:59.023
Ezra?

42:11.241 --> 42:11.946
Ezra?

42:15.696 --> 42:16.980
We'll talk soon, okay?
