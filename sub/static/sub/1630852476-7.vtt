00:01.043 --> 00:02.376
<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.420 --> 00:05.587
You'll all be creating
a next level brunch dish.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.880
- Mariah, mariah!
- Oh, my god!

00:06.966 --> 00:08.757
Mariah:
My dish didn't make it
to the platform.

00:08.843 --> 00:12.886
One dish was good enough
to save their team from
the elimination round--

00:12.930 --> 00:13.846
the lobster biscuit.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.974
- Let's go!
- Gordon: Nyesha and richard,

00:17.018 --> 00:18.851
both your teams
will be facing elimination.

00:18.894 --> 00:22.354
Which dish are you sending home?

00:22.398 --> 00:25.357
- It's the ribeye dish.
- Amber, I'm really sorry,

00:25.401 --> 00:27.067
but you will not become
the next level chef.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.194
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:31.196
Richard: Things are about
to take a step up.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.324
- No team is safe today.
- Oh, god.

00:34.368 --> 00:38.871
The worst three dishes
will head into the elimination.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.331
Only one of you will come back.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.834
- ( bleep )
- ae: This is crazy.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.544
Tricia:
I'm starting to panic.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.588
Each time I'm getting used to
the competition,

00:47.631 --> 00:48.714
it levels up again.

00:48.758 --> 00:50.132
Courtney:
The stakes are high.

00:50.176 --> 00:52.301
There's only ten of us,
and two of us are going home.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.511
I can't be
in the elimination tonight.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.596
Do or die.

00:55.639 --> 00:57.139
I don't wanna go home.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.493
Welcome back, guys.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.036
Line up, please.

01:20.539 --> 01:21.622
Excellent.

01:21.665 --> 01:22.915
How are we feeling, angie?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.666
I feel great.
I'm so happy to be here.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.252
How do you take down
the rest of the competition?

01:27.296 --> 01:30.047
I do my best on the days
they mess up.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.717
I've played it pretty safe
in this competition.

01:33.761 --> 01:38.931
I think it's important to
not alert the other contestants

01:38.974 --> 01:40.224
that I'm here to take them out.

01:40.267 --> 01:44.186
We started weeks ago
with 15 of you.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.523
And we are down
to the top ten.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.025
You guys are clearly
the cream of the crop.

01:50.069 --> 01:54.905
The difference between
a winning dish and a dish
that could get you sent home

01:54.949 --> 01:58.200
is down to a single ingredient.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.786
Things are getting to a point
where it's do or die,

02:00.830 --> 02:02.830
sink or swim,
if you can cook or not.

02:02.832 --> 02:05.916
This is the time to separate
yourself from the pack.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.918
If you're a sheep,
you're a sheep,

02:07.962 --> 02:12.131
but everybody else
who got some canines
gonna be biting today.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.924
Gordon told you the last time

02:13.968 --> 02:15.634
that things were
about to take a step up

02:15.678 --> 02:17.678
and get more difficult.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.889
So today you'll tackle
one of the trickiest
proteins out there.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.099
Oh, god.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.270
- Seafood.
- Yes!

02:26.313 --> 02:29.231
All I really wanna do
is go jump up in the air and go,

02:29.275 --> 02:31.900
"yeah!", like a cheesy
'80s movie.

02:31.944 --> 02:35.445
The difference between
overcooked and undercooked--
razor thin.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.115
At work, I'm always
the guy cooking seafood

02:38.159 --> 02:40.075
'cause it's the most expensive
thing on the menu,

02:40.119 --> 02:41.160
<i> and they wanna make sure</i>
<i> it's done right.</i>

02:41.453 --> 02:43.912
I feel like this is
the perfect challenge for me.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.164
You're gonna wanna do well today

02:45.207 --> 02:47.332
because there is
no team immunity

02:47.334 --> 02:50.586
and no one is safe
from elimination.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.088
At the end of the day,
the worst performing
three dishes

02:53.132 --> 02:56.175
will head into the elimination.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.594
Only one of you will come back.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.470
- What'd you--
- ( bleep )

03:00.514 --> 03:04.183
two of you will leave
the competition for good.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.059
Tricia:
<i> This is emotionally taxing.</i>

03:06.061 --> 03:10.022
It feels like each time
I'm slightly getting used
to the competition,

03:10.065 --> 03:11.356
<i> it levels up again.</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:12.983
Like, at some point
they're gonna be like,

03:12.985 --> 03:14.318
"now fly to the platform,"

03:14.320 --> 03:16.111
and I'm just gonna be like,
"whoo!"

03:16.155 --> 03:17.571
and then next level,
you're gonna have to teleport.

03:17.615 --> 03:21.867
You'll each have 45 minutes
to prove

03:21.911 --> 03:22.993
that you are the next level.

03:22.995 --> 03:23.994
All: Yes, chef.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.287
Richard:
Good luck, trail blaisers.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.497
Grab a keycard,
head to the elevator.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.167
Let's see where you end up.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.544
- Codspeed.
- "cod spe--"

03:35.341 --> 03:37.925
we came to do
what we love, guys.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.384
<i> This competition is crazy,</i>

03:39.428 --> 03:41.470
but I don't mind
what level I get

03:41.513 --> 03:43.597
because I'm stressed
at all levels

03:43.641 --> 03:45.057
so it doesn't even matter.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.227
Yes, yeah!

03:49.230 --> 03:50.812
- ( humming )
- I got this one?

03:50.814 --> 03:53.315
- Whoo, all right.
Second floor kitchen.
- Jonathan: Okay.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.652
Glad to be in the middle,
but the stakes are high.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.528
<i> There's no team immunity.</i>

03:58.572 --> 04:01.156
That means
that all of us collectively

04:01.200 --> 04:05.118
are going to have to create
the best dish

04:05.162 --> 04:07.246
that nobody is eliminated.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.039
We're the only team left
with four.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.292
Yes, we are,
and let's keep it that way.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.087
I'm looking for coconut milk
and chilean seabass.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.381
Yo, chilean seabass,
I get this,

04:17.424 --> 04:18.966
I'ma ( bleep )
this ( bleep ) up.

04:19.009 --> 04:21.051
I might gun for the seabass too.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.469
- First man get it.
- Yes.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.892
Finally!
Welcome back!

04:28.894 --> 04:31.395
Ah, hello, beautiful!

04:31.438 --> 04:32.896
Baby, I'm home.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.357
Oh! A blender.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.527
We're gonna
have number one dish.

04:38.529 --> 04:40.028
Number one dish, baby.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.196
Angie:
<i> We don't have seafood</i>
<i> in lubbock.</i>

04:41.240 --> 04:42.239
<i> We are landlocked,</i>

04:42.533 --> 04:45.325
and my worst fear
is seafood in the basement.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.620
Like, if I could just get
the top floor today,

04:48.664 --> 04:53.250
I would know that
angels were looking after me.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.794
Oi, yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi.

04:55.879 --> 04:56.920
Dang it!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.213
All right, guys.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.048
I'm really trying
to psych myself up,

05:00.050 --> 05:03.135
but my nerves are major today.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.255
- What's up, team?
- Hey, chef.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.808
Winning here
requires excellence,

05:09.852 --> 05:12.728
<i> and you're only as strong as</i>
<i> the weakest link on your team.</i>

05:12.730 --> 05:13.854
Line up, please.

05:14.106 --> 05:17.441
<i> With no team safety today,</i>
<i> cracks are gonna show.</i>

05:17.484 --> 05:20.068
I just really hope it doesn't
break my team apart.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.446
Nothing else matters
except this cook today.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.866
- Yes.
- All right, team blais,
let's fall in line over here.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.909
We got the most people left
on this team.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.036
- I know!
- Yes.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.245
Listen, tonight trail blaisers

05:30.289 --> 05:33.248
<i> have a huge target</i>
<i> on our backs.</i>

05:33.292 --> 05:35.751
<i> We got four people left</i>
<i> and we wanna keep it that way.</i>

05:35.794 --> 05:37.377
Double elimination,
we're not worried
about that right?

05:37.421 --> 05:38.211
No.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.038
Because if you cook
a great dish,

05:40.049 --> 05:40.589
you're not even going into that.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.090
Right.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.886
We got the best ingredients
and you got the best pick.
Show it off, okay?

05:45.929 --> 05:50.057
Right now we're separating
the sort of the good
from the average.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.477
<i> With three people going into</i>
<i> the elimination cook,</i>
<i> everyone has to step it up.</i>

05:53.520 --> 05:59.024
<i> We're on the top floor,</i>
<i> and my team needs to produce</i>
<i> top level dishes.</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:00.901
- Let's go, guys.
- Line up, guys. Line up.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.236
You know the deal.
When you see the green light,
it is go-time.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.074
- 45 minutes for
something magical, right?
- Yes, chef.

06:09.286 --> 06:13.080
Oh, my goodness me.
This is it.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.457
Go, guys.
Go, go, go.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.585
- Look at that.
- Excuse me.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.129
Reuel is in front of me,

06:21.173 --> 06:23.924
<i> and I'm trying to grab</i>
<i> my ingredient,</i>

06:23.926 --> 06:25.258
<i> but I see the seabass.</i>

06:25.302 --> 06:27.094
And I get to it first.
It's mine.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.012
- Yes.
- Any curry powder?

06:29.014 --> 06:30.931
- No.
- Um...

06:30.974 --> 06:35.227
Five, four, three, two, one.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.854
Grab, guys!
Grab, grab, grab!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.314
Well done!

06:39.358 --> 06:42.317
Chilean seabass.
Boom, we're good.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.236
Gordon:
What an amazing array
of ingredients.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.196
So the halibut,
how are you gonna cook that?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.492
( bleep )

06:52.329 --> 06:55.997
I thought I was grabbing
chilean seabass,
and I didn't double check.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.960
It's the fish that every chef
loves cooking because
it's the most difficult.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.254
- Yes, chef.
- It's gonna be a challenge.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.092
I can't wait to not have
to grocery shop in 30 seconds.

07:07.136 --> 07:10.137
- Richard: Go!
-<i> When I get home,</i>

07:10.139 --> 07:11.096
<i> I'm just gonna walk around</i>
<i> the grocery store</i>

07:11.140 --> 07:12.055
<i> for, like, an hour and a half</i>

07:12.099 --> 07:13.265
and then,
like, have a flashback

07:13.600 --> 07:16.017
and, like, knock somebody
out of the way for a protein.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.269
Richard: 15 seconds.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.563
<i> I am lit to see salmon.</i>

07:19.606 --> 07:21.440
I could not believe that
that piece of salmon
made it down to me.

07:21.483 --> 07:25.152
-<i> Whoo, lord. </i>
- Three, two, one.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.028
Whatever you can grab,
you can get.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.906
- Boom. Let's go.
- ( bleep )

07:29.992 --> 07:32.159
- I didn't mean to grab this.
- Time to cook.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.077
I have no idea what
I'm gonna do with this wine,
but we'll figure it out.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.037
- Whoo!
- Richard: How'd that
get there, huh?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.164
I don't know,
but I'm excited it did.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.124
Richard: All right. Okay.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.127
Go!

07:43.213 --> 07:44.588
Beautiful seafood, huh?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.214
Pyet: Branzino, sole.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.091
Nyesha: Make sure you grab
a protein, team.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.801
- I got a vision
right now, chef.
- The best.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.970
Zach:<i> I really was hoping</i>
<i> to get a halibut or seabass,</i>

07:52.014 --> 07:55.182
but there's absolutely
zero chance that that's gonna
get to the basement.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.643
And I see tilapia,
so I'm just gonna wing it.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.021
Three, two, one.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.389
It's still here.
Grab it if you can get it.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.025
- Oh, my gosh.
- Let's go!

08:05.027 --> 08:06.651
Good. I'm good.
I'm good.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.154
- I don't know what I got.
- Gordon: 43 minutes to go.

08:09.198 --> 08:12.407
- Three stunning proteins, yes?
- Absolutely, chef.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.409
What am I doing?
I'm not even thinking now.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.161
Reuel: Trish,
you feeling confident?

08:18.040 --> 08:20.373
<i> Elimination is my worst fear,</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:22.125
and now two people
are gonna go home,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.293
three people are going
into elimination.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.254
<i> I'm terrified,</i>
<i> and it's all panic.</i>

08:28.091 --> 08:29.216
<i> I'm always nervous.</i>

08:29.259 --> 08:30.634
I always feel
like I'm not enough,

08:30.677 --> 08:32.043
I'm not good enough.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.929
I'm sorry, chef, I'm shaking.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.348
- Gordon: You okay?
- Uh, no.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.272
- Gordon: You okay?
- Tricia: Uh, no.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.233
- Why are you shaking so much?
- I'm just scared, chef.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.735
- Scared of what?
- I don't wanna go home, chef.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.654
- Come on.
- Why do you think
you're gonna go home

08:50.697 --> 08:52.447
when you've got the most
amazing striped seabass?

08:52.491 --> 08:54.908
You have a great ingredient
there.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.284
Yes, chef, I just--
I get nervous.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.912
Chef ramsay
is one of my heroes.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.915
<i> I am very new</i>
<i> to the culinary arts.</i>

09:01.959 --> 09:06.127
<i> I gave up,</i>
<i> like, a six-figure job</i>
<i> to become a chef,</i>

09:06.171 --> 09:07.462
and if he sees something in me,

09:07.464 --> 09:09.297
then I really want
to make him proud.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.590
Gordon:
Right, let's go, young lady.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.675
You're a natural in the kitchen.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.135
You connect with food,
you connect with flavors.

09:14.179 --> 09:18.056
<i> I'm making a striped seabass</i>
<i> with maitake mushrooms</i>

09:18.100 --> 09:20.809
as well as honey butter
roasted asparagus.

09:20.811 --> 09:24.437
- Get that dish to
the next level tonight, okay?
- Yes, chef.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.523
- I don't want to see
anyone's hands shaking now.
- Yes, chef.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.316
We good, baby.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.153
All right, ae,
you got a little trip
to the asian marketplace.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.240
You got kimchi, ponzu,
fish sauce, and snapper,

09:35.284 --> 09:37.033
- so what do you got
going on here?
- These bones.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.160
If you can't pick them out,
you gotta cut them out.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.121
Make a little bit of an incision
with your knife.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.664
Ae:    <i> Lao people,</i>
<i> we eat the whole fish.</i>

09:43.041 --> 09:48.003
It's my favorite part
of the fish, the eyeballs,
so filets are new to me.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.963
- I'm gonna pan sear this.
- Okay.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.089
I'm gonna fry some kimchi
on the side,

09:51.466 --> 09:53.425
and I'm gonna pickle these
radishes with some jalapenos.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.093
You got tons of umami here,
right?

09:55.137 --> 09:58.597
Yes, I love the flavors
that dropkick you in the face.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.142
- Please dropkick me
in the face, ae!
- I would love to, chef.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.936
- Let's go, guys.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.479
Zach, what's the plan
with the fish?

10:06.481 --> 10:09.566
I'm three-shades breading it
with asian inspired seasoning.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.692
- Layering the seasoning,
correct?
- Yes, chef.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.069
And I'm gonna treat it
like a milwaukee fish fry.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.280
<i> This tilapia cannot be dry.</i>

10:15.282 --> 10:16.906
It's not a very fatty fish
to start with,

10:16.908 --> 10:18.533
so I have very little room
for error.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.245
<i> I'm worried about all these</i>
<i> mistakes that I've made</i>
<i> in the competition.</i>

10:22.289 --> 10:24.664
Every Friday in milwaukee,
you fry freaking fish,

10:24.708 --> 10:26.666
<i> and so I'm gonna</i>
<i> go with what I know best.</i>

10:26.710 --> 10:27.917
About to drop it now, chef.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.419
- Love that.
- Feeling good.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.296
What do you have in your batter
for your broccoli cake?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.923
The broccoli, the hijiki,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.884
a little bit of breadcrumb
for texture.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.011
- And how are you cooking this?
- I'm gonna finish in the fryer.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.471
Nyesha:
<i> In a next level seafood dish,</i>

10:39.514 --> 10:42.432
what I'm looking for
is finesse and elegance.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.851
Where's the moisture
coming in off this dish?

10:44.895 --> 10:46.645
I got my vin.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.774
<i> Zach has a lot</i>
<i> of fried items on his plate,</i>
<i> and it's very risky.</i>

10:50.817 --> 10:53.360
<i> Everything has to be cooked</i>
<i> to absolute perfection</i>

10:53.362 --> 10:54.402
<i> if he's gonna pull this off.</i>

10:54.696 --> 10:57.322
I do not want to see him
in this elimination again.

10:57.366 --> 11:00.325
- Tasting along the way,
yes, chef?
- Yes, chef.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.161
Gordon: Kenny, protein,
what'd you go for?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.913
- Black cod.
- Now that black cod's
super sweet, as you know.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.458
So we got the grits. How are you
gonna elevate those grits?
What are you gonna put in there?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.292
Yes, sir, I'm gonna do
a sweat pea grits,

11:09.503 --> 11:10.835
so it's gonna change
the color of it.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.003
I wanna see a winning dish
from you.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.088
Absolutely, chef.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.923
Today I really need
to push myself.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.217
You have to put up
that winning dish every time
from this point forward.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.301
Keep it going, guys.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.054
<i> Seafood is way more difficult</i>
<i> than cooking meat.</i>

11:21.056 --> 11:23.765
There's not several
temperatures. There's only one,
and that's called perfect.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.309
<i> But the big jeopardy</i>
<i> is that three are going</i>
<i> into elimination,</i>

11:26.353 --> 11:28.019
<i> but not from team ramsay.</i>

11:28.021 --> 11:28.812
30 minutes to go, guys.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.355
I want three
of the best dishes, yes?

11:30.357 --> 11:31.981
Kenny: Yes, chef.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.275
Richard:
All right, courtney, you gotta
bring the veg together.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.860
It looks like succotash vibes.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.153
Yeah, I'm gonna make a curry.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.031
A curry from scratch?
Is that something
you turn to often?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.282
Yeah, I make curry often.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.367
And then how are you gonna
cook the fish?

11:42.411 --> 11:44.160
This is about to go
in the deep fryer.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.205
That is such a smart decision.
Who doesn't love fried catfish?

11:47.249 --> 11:48.665
I'm headed to the fryer.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.875
I've had two top dishes
for my team already,

11:50.919 --> 11:53.044
<i> so I wanna make sure</i>
<i> that this dish</i>

11:53.088 --> 11:55.004
shows that
I'm continuing to grow.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.215
<i> We want it to be</i>
<i> literally perfect.</i>

11:57.259 --> 11:59.342
Okay, guys,
we're not going home today.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.137
Team trail blaisers
taking big swings

12:02.180 --> 12:03.430
<i> from the middle kitchen.</i>

12:03.432 --> 12:05.598
<i> Courtney's making a curry</i>
<i> from scratch,</i>

12:05.600 --> 12:07.684
<i> and ae is using flavors</i>
<i> from home.</i>

12:07.686 --> 12:10.228
<i> Trail blaisers</i>
<i> are not losing anyone today.</i>

12:10.272 --> 12:12.272
That elimination challenge
got me ready.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.315
How we feeling, chef?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.901
Like this has to be the best
freaking sole anyone's ever ate.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.111
Yes, chef.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.697
I'm really wracking my brain
about how to cook this fish.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.116
<i> It's so hard to get</i>
<i> an even cook in that basement.</i>

12:23.160 --> 12:26.828
This lends itself well
to very slow, elegant cooking.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.037
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sole loves a sauce.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.166
- Maybe poach and butter
in the oven.
- Yeah, I love that.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.960
So I finally have a direction.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.713
<i> I'm gonna make</i>
<i> perfectly poached sole,</i>

12:36.757 --> 12:40.425
<i> buttery, yummy sauce,</i>
<i> and then purple potatoes.</i>

12:40.460 --> 12:43.386
- Don't look so worried.
I believe in you.
- Yes, chef.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.805
The reality is
this seafood challenge

12:45.807 --> 12:48.141
<i>is bringing absolute excellence</i>
<i> out of these chefs,</i>

12:48.185 --> 12:50.477
<i> and I'm excited</i>
<i> to taste these dishes.</i>

12:50.520 --> 12:52.854
<i> Richard and gordon should</i>
<i> definitely be nervous.</i>

12:52.898 --> 12:55.231
You guys got this.
20 minutes remain, team!

12:55.233 --> 12:59.110
- Zach: Heard, chef.
- What goes well with seafood?

12:59.154 --> 13:01.154
- Uh...
- The finest garnish
in the world.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.156
Why are you gonna shoot me
in the foot now?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.033
I already had a perfect dish.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.410
- Platform is on its way.
- Richard: Look at that!

13:07.454 --> 13:09.913
- What's happening?
- Oh, yes. Here it comes.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.248
- On the move.
- Mid-drop. Mid-drop.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.335
Caviar and seaweed.
15 seconds.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.587
Either caviar or a seaweed.

13:19.174 --> 13:22.425
Chef kissed my dish.
The seaweed drop is perfect.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.385
- Gordon: Yes? Good.
- Seaweed, chef.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.514
I am lacking
the crunchy element,

13:27.557 --> 13:30.266
but roasted seaweed
enhances my textures.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.811
I can actually fry some
and put some on top.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.270
I will not ( bleep ) up today.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.397
- It's perfect.
- Lift that, yes?

13:36.399 --> 13:38.733
- I wanna get
the best dish today, chef.
- You got this.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.861
The platform's on the way.
Grab some seaweed
and caviar right now.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.987
- You gotta go grab it.
- What?

13:43.281 --> 13:46.491
- Richard: Seaweed and caviar.
- Damn! Caviar? Okay.

13:46.535 --> 13:50.620
Four, three, two, one.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.372
All right, there we go.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.207
Remember it's salt.
Potatoes love salt.

13:54.251 --> 13:57.085
Caviar are potatoes are, like,
the paris and nicole
of the food world,

13:57.128 --> 14:00.004
upscale but still best friends,
you know what I mean?

14:00.048 --> 14:01.589
You have, like, the prime grab.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.632
You have a top floor caviar.

14:02.676 --> 14:03.675
Okay!

14:03.969 --> 14:07.220
Platform is coming, team.
Seaweed and caviar.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.181
- ( bleep )
- yes!

14:10.225 --> 14:12.267
I don't even know what this is.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.768
I am making
a fried mahi-mahi taco.

14:13.812 --> 14:17.230
<i> I need to find something</i>
<i> that's gonna add some flavor.</i>

14:17.232 --> 14:20.275
I grab the seaweed.
I don't know how
that's gonna pan out.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.985
What's the plan here?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.279
I'm gonna put it on top
of the taco.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.989
I'm thinking maybe fry it too.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.575
That's not a bad idea.
Texture.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.034
Zach: Let's go!

14:30.078 --> 14:31.911
You have to get those
in your dishes.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.663
How we feeling, chef?
Dish coming together?

14:33.665 --> 14:36.291
- I hope so, chef.
- You have to think elegance.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.877
I'm picturing something
in my mind with the potatoes

14:38.920 --> 14:40.712
making it beautiful
with that red caviar.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.339
- Make sure those potatoes
are cooked through and moist.
- Yes, chef.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.050
There's only ten of us
and two of us are going home.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.719
Oh, that's wrong.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.972
<i> Being a home chef,</i>
<i> this is a lot of pressure.</i>

14:51.016 --> 14:52.891
I feel like my soul has escaped

14:52.976 --> 14:55.059
and replaced it
with some panicky girl.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.395
- Something burning?
- Ooh!

15:00.066 --> 15:03.067
- I feel really bad for angie.
- Damn it.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.571
<i> I don't understand where</i>
<i> the lack of confidence</i>
<i> is coming from.</i>

15:06.656 --> 15:08.031
( bleep )

15:08.033 --> 15:09.949
I did that wrong too.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.159
Angie ragan.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.293
- Something burning?
- Ooh.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.297
Damn it. Angie ragan.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.759
- I did that wrong too.
- It's okay, ange.

15:27.761 --> 15:32.347
Cooking in the basement,
you know, the adversity
triggers creativity.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.015
Okay, so the potatoes
are ( bleep ).

15:34.059 --> 15:36.476
Well, nerves wipe
all creativity out.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.353
Get out of your head.
You can do this.

15:38.396 --> 15:41.022
- Yes, chef.
- I've seen you cook
brilliant food.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.024
Today is not the day
for mental errors.

15:43.068 --> 15:48.029
<i> Angie needs to focus</i>
<i> and cook with intention</i>
<i> and bring this home.</i>

15:48.073 --> 15:49.447
Poor little ugly potatoes.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.116
I wanna see that confidence
that I know she has.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.618
- Pull it together.
- Yes, chef.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.662
I gotta get my crap straight.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.997
- Courage, passion,
excellence.
- Yes, chef.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.457
- Yes, chef.
- You can do this!

15:59.459 --> 16:00.959
- Yes, we can.
- Zach: Yes, chef!

16:02.087 --> 16:05.838
15 minutes to go.
Flip that fish over now.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.173
Good. Beautiful halibut.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.592
Being from trinidad,
we're surrounded by water,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.177
<i> so I love seafood.</i>

16:11.179 --> 16:12.220
That glaze on there
is beautiful.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.930
What type of purée
is that gonna be?

16:13.974 --> 16:16.349
Asparagus, a little bit
of coconut, cauliflower,

16:16.393 --> 16:18.351
and a little bit of potato
in there.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.103
I want my dish
to have some depth.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.064
Getting picked first
by chef ramsay felt amazing.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.941
You got a great palate,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.609
and you know how
to finesse a dish.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.195
He picked me for a reason,
and I'm only here
to make you proud,

16:29.239 --> 16:30.905
so I'm bringing it.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.616
- I want the very best tonight.
- Heard, chef.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.784
Kenny, nice,
the skin beautiful.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.869
- It needs to cook
underneath there now.
- Yes, chef.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.246
- Three stunning proteins.
- Heard.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.289
- Three next level dishes, yes?
- Absolutely, chef.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.374
- Yes, chef.
- Good.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.293
All right, mariah,
what's in the fish cake?

16:44.337 --> 16:47.380
I got pollock, coriander,
cumin, paprika,

16:47.424 --> 16:49.424
going with the sort of
the moroccan theme?

16:49.467 --> 16:50.550
Yes.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.136
<i> Growing up poor, my mom used</i>
<i> to make salmon croquets</i>

16:53.179 --> 16:54.429
out of, like, canned salmon

16:54.514 --> 16:57.223
<i> and she would incorporate</i>
<i> all these flavors.</i>

16:57.267 --> 16:59.017
I like where this is going!

16:59.060 --> 17:01.352
<i> So this is definitely</i>
<i> channeling memories</i>

17:01.396 --> 17:04.063
of taking this
inexpensive cut of fish

17:04.065 --> 17:07.442
<i> and transforming it</i>
<i> into a luxurious experience.</i>

17:07.444 --> 17:10.945
- And what is the sauce?
- Shallot vinaigrette
with merlot.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.989
I could actually add these
sundried tomatoes in there.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.074
- Legitimate goosebumps. Yes!
- I like it.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.200
Thinking on your feet.
I love that.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.952
Okay, jonathan,
what do we got?

17:18.038 --> 17:21.039
I've got salmon.
It's a play on a dish
called cullen skink.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.373
It's a scottish dish.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.168
- Tugging on gordon's
heartstrings there?
- Trying to, chef.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.336
Cullen skink is
a traditional scottish soup.

17:27.380 --> 17:31.299
<i> It's usually got aromatics</i>
<i> in it with potatoes</i>
<i> and smoked fish.</i>

17:31.342 --> 17:33.926
- The original dish is a soup.
- But do you want it
to be a soup?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.928
- Not today.
- So it's a riff off of it?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.221
- So it's the sauce?
- Yes, sir.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.348
I'm going to make a play
on cullen skink

17:39.392 --> 17:40.892
<i> with smoked</i>
<i> paprika rubbed salmon,</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:42.977
<i> an aromatic purée,</i>
<i> and fondant potatoes.</i>

17:43.021 --> 17:46.731
It's risky,
but if you can pull it off,
it'll be impressive.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.776
I understand
that it's a bold move to make
a classic scottish dish

17:49.819 --> 17:53.196
that's a little deconstructed,
but three people are going
into the elimination,

17:53.239 --> 17:55.406
and you gotta stay sexy here
and not get murdered.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.116
Ten minutes left.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.036
Watch your tortilla, chef.

18:00.038 --> 18:00.995
You're building that taco
in your mind, right?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.748
It's gonna be, like,
a creamy avocado sauce.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.000
- Okay, cool.
- I don't have lime,
so I'm gonna have to use

18:06.086 --> 18:07.794
whatever sourness
from this apple that I have.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.170
Oh, beautiful. Smart, chef.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.380
Yeah, just gotta
think smart today.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.592
My passion,
like, burns really deep,

18:14.677 --> 18:16.677
and I'm not just doing this,
like, for me.

18:16.721 --> 18:20.348
<i> I'm doing this for people</i>
<i> from the indigenous community</i>

18:20.350 --> 18:22.934
to show them, like,
your dreams are possible

18:22.977 --> 18:24.852
<i> and just keep feeding</i>
<i> that fire</i>

18:24.896 --> 18:27.021
and it can literally take you
anywhere that you wanna go.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.232
- All the way to the top, right?
- Exactly, chef.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.362
Richard: Five minutes left!
Look at this fried seaweed.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.988
- It looks like
a beautiful garnish.
- That'll be a garnish.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.032
If I lived under the ocean,
courtney,

18:38.076 --> 18:40.827
I would build a house with that.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.162
I wanna see three
next level dishes, okay?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.997
You've got
all the elements there.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.667
Let's go, guys. Come on.
Taste, taste, taste.

18:47.710 --> 18:51.337
- Under two minutes.
60 seconds away from plating.
- Heard. Heard, chef.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.214
I love how you're the closest
to the platform today.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.383
- Heard, yes.
- I think that was a choice.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.218
( laughs )

18:57.262 --> 18:59.053
- let's go, pyet.
- Yes, chef.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.972
- Winning dishes, yes?
- Yes.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.224
It's do or die right now.
I know I gotta be moving fast.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.977
- How many are you cooking for?
- I'm just trying to get the
perfect shape right now, chef.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.104
- You don't need all those
for the plate. Come on.
- Heard, chef.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.440
- Platform's here!
- Gordon: Let's go, guys.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.153
- Everyone gets their plate on.
- All: Yes, chef!

19:15.155 --> 19:16.946
- 15 seconds.
- I think it's gonna be great.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.364
Nyesha:
Platform's here. Let's go!

19:18.408 --> 19:22.451
- Bottom, bottom, bottom.
- Six, five, four, three,

19:22.495 --> 19:24.579
two, one.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.666
- Good job.
- Thank you, chef.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.043
Richard: 15 seconds!
You gotta get to the platform.

19:31.087 --> 19:34.755
I'm so anxious.
Being in the elimination
made me a stronger competitor,

19:34.799 --> 19:37.049
<i> but I'm never gonna</i>
<i> miss the platform again.</i>

19:37.051 --> 19:40.386
- Five, four, three...
- Move!

19:40.430 --> 19:44.098
- I'm sorry. Go.
- Two, one.
Get to the platform!

19:45.351 --> 19:46.851
Let's go, guys.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.687
Beautiful.
Really beautiful.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.898
Five. Come on, tricia, please.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.984
Three, two, one.
And stop. Well done! Yes!

19:55.028 --> 19:57.904
- Let's go! Good!
- How you feeling?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.447
Well done.
Trish, how do you feel?

19:59.449 --> 20:01.324
My plating's
a little simple, chef.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.576
How do we get rid
of those nerves?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.994
Tricia:<i> I'm not confident.</i>

20:05.038 --> 20:07.830
Not only are three people
going up for elimination,

20:07.874 --> 20:09.290
<i> only one is surviving.</i>

20:09.334 --> 20:14.128
I have so much to prove
to myself, to chef ramsay.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.175
I'm just really hoping
my dish is enough

20:19.177 --> 20:21.427
<i> to be safe from elimination.</i>

20:21.471 --> 20:23.262
Stop shaking.

20:34.651 --> 20:38.986
Today was about creating
next level seafood dishes.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.030
Visually, you did just that.

20:41.074 --> 20:46.118
I think this is
some of the best food
we've seen all competition.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.329
Let's hope they taste
as good as they look

20:48.331 --> 20:51.332
because the worst three dishes
on this table

20:51.376 --> 20:54.585
will head into the elimination.

20:54.629 --> 20:58.422
Only one of you will come back.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.258
Let's start on the top floor.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.886
This dish is a striped seabass

21:03.930 --> 21:06.472
that's topped with
the maitake mushrooms

21:06.516 --> 21:08.349
with fried nori.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.227
I'm on the top floor this time,

21:11.271 --> 21:14.230
so I know dish definitely
needs to be perfect.

21:16.484 --> 21:19.068
This dish is exciting
on my palate.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.904
Seaweed flavors come through
very elegantly.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.447
Gordon: Wow, delicious.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.827
I think this is
one of the strongest dishes
this individual has cooked.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.954
Everything works on this dish.

21:29.998 --> 21:34.125
This competition
is one of the hardest things
I've ever done in my life,

21:34.168 --> 21:37.712
<i> but today I finally found</i>
<i> my little tidbit of confidence</i>

21:37.755 --> 21:41.757
and I'm gonna let it grow
not to arrogance level,

21:41.801 --> 21:45.845
but I'm gonna keep letting
this momentum take me forward.

21:45.847 --> 21:50.057
Next one,
this was a beautifully
pan-seared slice of halibut.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.091
Underneath that was
a cauliflower purée

21:51.352 --> 21:53.686
dotted around with
that little bit of caviar.

21:53.730 --> 21:59.108
The halibut itself
could've used just
a little bit less cooking.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.902
I love that little pop
that you get from the caviar.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.156
Next one.
This is a black cod.

22:05.199 --> 22:08.159
It's sat on the bed
of beautiful sweet pea grits.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.036
Fish is cooked beautifully.
Oh, my god.

22:10.038 --> 22:13.622
- Look at that.
- The fish and grits, that's
just a classic combination.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.083
Adding peas sort of takes it
to the next level.

22:16.127 --> 22:19.295
It really sort of gives
this sweet savoriness
to this dish.

22:19.297 --> 22:24.300
Definitely next level dishes
coming from the top floor.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.052
I hope the same came from
the middle floor, richard.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.971
Yes. Team ramsay put out
some tasty dishes,

22:28.973 --> 22:32.141
<i> but team blais,</i>
<i> we're gonna blow them</i>
<i> out of the water.</i>

22:32.185 --> 22:36.136
All right, we'll start
with this crispy catfish

22:36.147 --> 22:39.899
over in a homemade curry sauce
with crispy seaweed.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.275
Courtney:
<i> I cook catfish all the time,</i>

22:41.319 --> 22:43.694
<i> but seafood</i>
<i> is one of those things</i>

22:43.696 --> 22:48.032
where you either
cook it perfectly or you don't.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.410
The catfish,
how is that cooked?
Wow, glistening.

22:54.165 --> 22:57.083
This is an amazing utilization
of the seaweed.

22:57.085 --> 23:01.253
Way to elevate a fish
that is not usually seen
in this sort of light.

23:01.297 --> 23:04.256
Spot on.
Absolutely delicious.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.051
The only thing I'd want
to see from that

23:07.095 --> 23:10.096
is the ( bleep ) recipe.

23:10.139 --> 23:13.099
You did good.
Today was a good day.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.144
Congratulations.
That is next level.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.439
Our next dish over here
is pollock fish cake

23:20.483 --> 23:22.274
with sort of
a moroccan inspiration.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.359
Gordon:
Fish cakes are delicious.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.612
That sauce
is absolutely stunning.

23:26.656 --> 23:30.032
Our next dish here
is a seared red snapper

23:30.034 --> 23:31.659
with charred kimchi.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.204
For me, this is ossetra caviar.
This was the prime pick.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.164
Should've been picked on,
you know, the top floor.

23:37.208 --> 23:40.835
The actual fish is tasty,
but it's the combinations

23:40.878 --> 23:42.378
that have gone
absolutely haywire here.

23:42.422 --> 23:46.257
We never serve the best caviar
dumped on top of a chili.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.050
That's never gonna work.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.052
Definitely very briny forward.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.054
It's overpowering
the rest of the dish.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.639
It's badly thought out.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.516
( bleep )

23:55.560 --> 23:56.892
you know and I know
that I ( bleep ) up.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.728
Why'd you have
to say it out loud?
Why can't you just whisper?

23:59.772 --> 24:03.065
<i> Unfortunately</i>
<i> there's three people going to</i>
<i> elimination today,</i>

24:03.067 --> 24:05.776
and I know for sure
that one of them is me.

24:05.862 --> 24:09.864
Our last dish here
from the middle floor,
rendition of cullen skink.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.241
- What?
- Which is a dish I'm not
very familiar with.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.285
- Gordon, you might be.
- Quite honestly,

24:14.287 --> 24:17.246
it looks like the most bizarre
cullen skink on the planet.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.665
'cause it's a soup
traditionally.

24:19.709 --> 24:20.791
It's something
we grew up with in scotland.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.836
Richard: Instead of a soup,
what we have is a purée

24:23.880 --> 24:24.712
of the leek, the scallions,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.590
and some celery
with some brown butter.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.638
Took a risk,
but not seeing some great faces.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.808
Salmon could've been done
with maybe another
two minutes in the pan.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.895
It's just hard to eat this.
Should we go to the basement?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.354
Basement chefs, yes.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.191
<i> Seafood can be</i>
<i> very tricky to get right,</i>

24:45.234 --> 24:46.817
but some of these dishes
are phenomenal.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.903
<i> I'm not worried.</i>
<i> I mean, team nyesha,</i>

24:48.946 --> 24:49.904
<i> we've been</i>
<i> in the basement before,</i>

24:49.989 --> 24:52.990
<i> and my team brings the heat.</i>

24:53.034 --> 24:56.911
First we have
a beautiful mahi-mahi taco.

24:56.954 --> 25:00.039
On the bottom,
you have an edamame
and crushed avocado sauce.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.583
This is topped
with crispy seaweed.

25:04.629 --> 25:07.379
I love the crispy seaweed
and that avocado crema.

25:07.465 --> 25:11.008
This is about
textural contrasts
and it's got a lot of it.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.302
Three words--
next level taco.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.223
I think I really have
a good chance at walking away

25:17.266 --> 25:19.433
with the money bag
and, like, the mentorship,

25:19.477 --> 25:21.936
and that just feels
incredible to me,

25:21.979 --> 25:24.271
to, like, feel that validation

25:24.315 --> 25:27.024
through my hard work
in this competition.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.027
We have here a sole.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.947
This is finished
with a trout caviar

25:32.949 --> 25:34.198
and purple peewee potatoes.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.117
So visually, this dish
has no sole on the plate.

25:37.161 --> 25:38.827
You don't make a butter sauce

25:38.871 --> 25:41.830
and then stick more butter
on top of the butter sauce.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.374
Oh, my god. Why?

25:43.417 --> 25:46.252
I'm gonna have to take that off.
I'm sorry. Doctor's orders.

25:46.295 --> 25:50.005
I wish I could go up there
and grab my plate and run.

25:50.049 --> 25:53.467
This is a classic showing of
an ingredient grab gone wrong.

25:53.511 --> 25:56.178
It's underwhelming
unfortunately. What a shame.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.430
Nyesha:
<i> I think angie's come so far</i>

25:58.474 --> 26:00.641
<i> and has learned so much</i>
<i> in this competition,</i>

26:00.685 --> 26:03.602
but angie cannot afford
to make fundamental mistakes.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.271
<i> There's so much on the line.</i>

26:05.314 --> 26:08.190
This competition is called
"next level chef" for a reason.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.527
Our last dish,
we have a crispy tilapia

26:11.529 --> 26:13.445
with a broccoli cake.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.197
Two fried things
on the same plate

26:15.199 --> 26:17.408
is kind of bewildering.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.038
I need some water.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.750
It is absolutely dry as a bone.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.628
That deep fried tilapia
looks like a chicken tender.

26:29.672 --> 26:32.006
<i> That thing is so breaded,</i>

26:32.049 --> 26:34.383
drunk at 3:00 am,
I wouldn't eat it,

26:34.385 --> 26:36.677
and that's saying something.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.095
Gordon: Please, all of you,
give us a moment.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.389
We've got a lot to discuss.

26:40.433 --> 26:43.851
There are amazing dishes,
but some of these plates

26:43.894 --> 26:46.103
are just blatantly
missing the mark.

26:46.147 --> 26:48.063
<i> We are down to the top ten.</i>

26:48.107 --> 26:50.899
<i> We should be seeing</i>
<i> nothing but the best.</i>

26:50.985 --> 26:52.318
I mean, that fried catfish--

26:52.361 --> 26:54.320
when do you see
that level of finesse?

26:54.322 --> 26:56.280
And then that
fried seaweed on top?

26:56.282 --> 26:59.450
- Absolutely delicious.
The textures were impeccable.
- Yeah.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.702
- It was so tasty.
- My other one though,
it's that taco.

27:01.746 --> 27:04.288
- Gordon: Taco was amazing.
- Nyesha: Oh, my gosh.
The taco was fantastic.

27:04.332 --> 27:07.583
This is a day of high highs
and low lows.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.294
<i> But today's not about finding</i>
<i> the best dish.</i>

27:10.379 --> 27:13.047
<i> It's about finding</i>
<i> the three weakest dishes.</i>

27:13.090 --> 27:15.883
The snapper in that broth?

27:15.926 --> 27:19.094
And then the raw chili
topped with the caviar?

27:19.096 --> 27:21.680
- It was all over the place.
- Nyesha: Absolutely.

27:21.724 --> 27:24.558
The other weird one
for me was that take
on the cullen skink.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.520
Badly executed. Tilapia?

27:30.358 --> 27:33.025
I've had frozen fish sticks
that are better.

27:33.027 --> 27:35.110
Yeah, that sole dish
with a butter sauce

27:35.145 --> 27:37.196
topped with
a compound butter...

27:37.198 --> 27:38.822
Butter on butter
on butter, right?

27:38.866 --> 27:42.284
Strange. Picking three chefs
for tonight's elimination,

27:42.286 --> 27:44.953
we're spoilt for choice
all for the wrong reason.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.456
This is very tough for me
because there's more

27:47.500 --> 27:51.043
than three dishes that deserve
to go into the elimination.

27:55.383 --> 27:57.883
This is a difficult choice
today.

27:57.927 --> 28:01.345
Even though tonight
the top dish won't win
safety for their team,

28:01.389 --> 28:06.058
we feel it's always important
to celebrate excellence
in the kitchen.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.435
The one dish that rose
above the others...

28:11.148 --> 28:14.108
...Was that fried catfish.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.193
- Great job, courtney.
- Oh, wow.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.611
You have absolutely leveled up.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.279
Thank you.

28:19.281 --> 28:25.077
Really amazing feeling to have
three equally talented chefs

28:25.121 --> 28:26.662
<i> have such high praise.</i>

28:26.664 --> 28:30.165
I'm just simply in awe

28:30.167 --> 28:33.627
<i> that I created that.</i>

28:33.671 --> 28:35.921
Gordon: Even though courtney
had the best dish today,

28:35.965 --> 28:39.091
no one is safe from elimination.

28:40.261 --> 28:43.971
The first dish heading
into the elimination

28:44.014 --> 28:48.350
was a dish that
just did not make sense.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.978
That dish is...

28:51.021 --> 28:54.398
The deep-fried dry tilapia.

28:56.235 --> 29:00.028
That thing was so overcooked
and not well thought out.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.197
I know what you can do,
I know you're a good cook,

29:02.241 --> 29:05.242
but you have to connect
your execution

29:05.286 --> 29:07.119
and create that roadmap.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.620
I'm definitely better
than what I just did,

29:08.664 --> 29:10.706
<i> so I just gotta get ready</i>
<i> for this elimination cook.</i>

29:10.750 --> 29:11.957
It's do or die.

29:12.001 --> 29:17.004
The second dish
facing elimination tonight...

29:21.010 --> 29:22.551
...The seared salmon.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.554
Badly constructed,
slightly undercooked,

29:25.598 --> 29:27.556
but just did not come together.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.183
Jonathan:<i> This sucks.</i>

29:29.185 --> 29:30.350
<i> Stepped outside</i>
<i> my comfort zone,</i>

29:30.394 --> 29:31.477
and I really thought
I was doing,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.103
like, a good thing
stepping out today.

29:33.147 --> 29:35.898
<i> All I can do is fight,</i>
<i> so that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

29:35.900 --> 29:40.944
The final person cooking
in elimination is...

29:40.988 --> 29:43.572
Ae:<i> I am so terrified</i>
<i> to be in elimination.</i>

29:43.616 --> 29:44.823
<i> It is intimidating.</i>

29:44.867 --> 29:47.159
It is scary.
It's a no for me.

29:47.161 --> 29:49.411
This was pretty tough.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.122
Angie:<i> This is the most</i>
<i> nervous I've been ever</i>

29:52.166 --> 29:53.957
on this competition.

29:54.001 --> 29:57.544
<i> I'm trying not to throw up.</i>

29:57.588 --> 30:02.090
Uh, this is hard.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.307
The final person cooking
in elimination...

30:13.229 --> 30:14.478
Is...

30:20.569 --> 30:22.861
...The pan-seared snapper.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.154
( bleep )

30:24.198 --> 30:26.281
the caviar on the chili
at the end,

30:26.283 --> 30:29.993
man, that is a big no-no.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.704
My flavors will likely
dropkick you in the face,

30:32.748 --> 30:35.541
but I guess I dropkicked myself
in the face today.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.584
But I still have another
chance to prove myself,

30:37.628 --> 30:39.586
so I'm gonna give it my all.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.839
<i> Do or die.</i>

30:41.882 --> 30:43.382
Team, to say
that I'm disappointed,

30:43.384 --> 30:45.384
it's an understatement for sure.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.845
You have to grab
the right ingredients,
you have to execute,

30:47.847 --> 30:50.889
and you have to
put something on the plate
that looks beautiful.

30:50.933 --> 30:54.184
The last thing I wanna do
is send chef jonathan
or chef ae home.

30:54.228 --> 30:56.728
<i> If I end up losing two chefs,</i>

30:56.772 --> 30:59.306
<i> it would not be a good look</i>
<i> for team blais.</i>

30:59.316 --> 31:02.067
But we're trying to find
the best chef.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.321
There's only a one
in three chance

31:06.365 --> 31:09.116
of returning
to the competition tonight.

31:09.159 --> 31:12.286
Everyone else, say goodbye
to your three fellow chefs.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.329
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.623
- You got this, all right?
- Wish them luck,

31:16.667 --> 31:19.251
- 'cause they're gonna need it.
- You got this.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.336
Jonathan:
<i> It's always tough going</i>
<i> into the elimination,</i>

31:21.380 --> 31:23.872
and it's bittersweet
having ae there with me.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.382
- You're gonna be okay.
- Okay.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.093
We're competing
against each other, which we
have been the entire time,

31:28.095 --> 31:30.304
but today it's to go home,
and that's tough.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.222
<i> But I wanna prove to richard</i>
<i> that I can win.</i>

31:33.350 --> 31:35.058
Now, all of you,

31:35.102 --> 31:38.645
I wanna give you all
the very best opportunity
to save yourselves

31:38.689 --> 31:42.107
by providing you with one
of the most incredible,

31:42.151 --> 31:45.569
versatile proteins in the sea.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.154
Shrimp.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.825
Ae:<i> There's three people going</i>
<i> to elimination today.</i>

31:51.869 --> 31:54.745
The odds are slim for sure,

31:54.788 --> 31:58.582
but I'm pretty good
at cooking shrimp, so let's go.

31:58.626 --> 32:03.295
So since gordon doesn't
have a chef in the elimination,
he'll be overseeing the cook.

32:03.297 --> 32:08.091
We wanna see three next level
shrimp dishes tonight.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.426
Head to the lift.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.637
Zach:<i> I feel very confident.</i>

32:11.680 --> 32:14.014
<i> I'm the only one</i>
<i> who's a professional chef.</i>

32:14.058 --> 32:16.141
I'm done friggin' embarrassing
myself in this competition.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.310
<i> I'm really ready to show</i>
<i> I belong here today.</i>

32:18.354 --> 32:22.230
It's kinda dark right now,
but that's when the light
inside shines brightest.

32:27.696 --> 32:31.323
Jonathan:<i> This sucks,</i>
<i> but I'm very familiar</i>
<i> with shrimp.</i>

32:31.367 --> 32:34.117
We got beautiful gulf seafood
that's delivered to
central alabama every week.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.119
So I'm going to go in there
and see what I can do

32:36.163 --> 32:37.996
about cranking out
some flavor from home.

32:39.750 --> 32:44.336
Right, remember,
sadly there's two of you
leaving the competition.

32:44.380 --> 32:45.629
- Make sure it's not you.
- All: Yes, chef.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.463
Line up at the back please.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.174
It is my first time
in elimination,

32:49.218 --> 32:51.301
and of course
there's three people in it.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.221
<i> I gotta bring in my all, man.</i>
<i> It's go-time.</i>

32:54.264 --> 32:57.599
30 minutes to cook
an amazing shrimp dish, yes?

32:57.601 --> 32:58.892
All: Yes, chef.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.185
Pyet: Let's go, guys.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.312
Gordon:
On your mark, get set.

33:02.356 --> 33:05.065
I wanna see three
next level dishes.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.442
And go! Let's go! 30 minutes.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.277
Let's go, guys.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.279
I'm getting to
the freaking platform first.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.699
( bleep )

33:13.701 --> 33:16.118
I'm really looking
for a nice white vegetable

33:16.161 --> 33:17.786
<i>that I can make a purée out of,</i>

33:17.830 --> 33:21.248
but I'm not seeing
a lot of the stuff that
I'm game planning for.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.457
On to plan b.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.084
I'm feeling a little bit
concerned right now,

33:24.128 --> 33:25.460
<i> but this is</i>
<i> an elimination challenge,</i>

33:25.462 --> 33:27.295
<i> so we're going home</i>
<i> if we don't win,</i>

33:27.297 --> 33:29.423
and I'm gonna do
whatever it takes.

33:29.466 --> 33:32.050
- Tell me about the dish.
- I'm going to make

33:32.052 --> 33:33.969
a lao grilled shrimp yum salad.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.262
It's sweet and sour, garlicy.

33:35.389 --> 33:39.057
- This idea comes from where?
- This is lao food.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.351
I'm not making just a salad.

33:41.395 --> 33:43.353
<i> I'm gonna be authentically ae,</i>

33:43.397 --> 33:44.896
<i> and I'm gonna cook a lao dish</i>

33:44.898 --> 33:46.023
and I'm gonna rep my people.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.150
<i> Vibrant colors, texture,</i>

33:48.152 --> 33:50.027
it is anything but basic, okay?

33:50.029 --> 33:53.155
These taste buds
will twerk their asses off.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.323
You cook brilliantly.
You've got that flavor profile.

33:55.409 --> 33:56.450
You're going up against
two tough guys.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.952
- Confident you can
get through this?
- Yes.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.038
Okay. Good luck.
25 minutes to go.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.873
It smell like the south
over there!

34:02.875 --> 34:05.709
- Whisk those grits.
- Thank you, chef.

34:05.753 --> 34:09.212
- Elevated shrimp and grits.
Make it next level, yes?
- Yes, chef.

34:09.256 --> 34:10.589
<i> To create a next level dish,</i>

34:10.632 --> 34:12.883
I'm going with elevated
stone ground grits,

34:12.968 --> 34:15.010
<i> blackened shrimp</i>
<i> for the top of the dish,</i>

34:15.054 --> 34:16.970
and then I'm making
a shrimp gravy

34:17.014 --> 34:18.889
<i> with tomatoes</i>
<i> and some aromatics.</i>

34:18.932 --> 34:20.057
I know it'll be good.

34:20.059 --> 34:20.974
So we're ten minutes in,

34:21.018 --> 34:22.225
we're 20 minutes to go, yes?

34:22.519 --> 34:25.437
- Yes, chef.
- Now, zach, tell me
about the elevation.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.223
How are we gonna get this thing
into that premiere league?

34:28.233 --> 34:29.900
In lieu of a cauliflower purée,

34:29.943 --> 34:31.234
I'm gonna make somewhat
of a soubise over here.

34:31.278 --> 34:34.071
<i> I'm making</i>
<i> caramelized onion soubise,</i>

34:34.114 --> 34:37.449
roasted broccoli,
and a boozy jus

34:37.451 --> 34:39.659
<i> to glaze my shrimp</i>
<i> while I'm sautéing it.</i>

34:41.246 --> 34:43.455
How much brandy
did you put in there?

34:43.457 --> 34:45.624
- Just enough, chef.
- The whole bottle.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.834
He saved just enough to drink
at the end.

34:47.878 --> 34:50.754
- Your burning off, yes?
- Yes, chef.

34:50.798 --> 34:53.131
This is where this competition
literally takes off.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.300
<i> We have jonathan, a home cook;</i>

34:55.344 --> 34:57.761
<i> ae, a social media chef;</i>

34:57.805 --> 34:59.096
<i> and zach,</i>
<i> a proper professional,</i>

34:59.139 --> 35:01.306
<i> all cooking their versions</i>
<i> of a shrimp dish.</i>

35:01.350 --> 35:03.016
<i> But with two people</i>
<i> on the chopping block,</i>

35:03.060 --> 35:04.309
<i> honestly, it's anyone's game.</i>

35:04.603 --> 35:08.146
We're coming up to just over
12 minutes to go, guys, okay?

35:09.983 --> 35:13.360
Easy, easy.
I see jonathan put in
the crab spice in there.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.946
<i> Damn, that's gonna be</i>
<i> a sodium bomb,</i>

35:15.989 --> 35:19.032
and I like salt a lot.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.618
What you thinking, jon?
What's that face?
I didn't like that face.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.703
- Tricia: Yeah.
- Jonathan:
Just super, super salty.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.122
Too much salt could make
or break this dish.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.332
- Jonathan, what do you need?
- Kenny: Stay composed.

35:27.376 --> 35:29.000
<i> There's no room</i>
<i> for mistakes today</i>

35:29.044 --> 35:30.043
'cause two people
are going home.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.044
( bleep )

35:31.046 --> 35:32.462
<i> it's not good at all.</i>

35:38.387 --> 35:40.345
Gordon: We're down to
six minutes, you three,

35:40.389 --> 35:43.557
and remember,
there's two of you leaving
the competition tonight,

35:43.600 --> 35:44.850
so make sure it's not you.

35:44.893 --> 35:46.309
Heard, chef.

35:47.938 --> 35:50.147
- What's that face?
I didn't like that face.
- Tricia: Yeah.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.648
Jonathan:
Just super, super salty.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.400
( bleep )

35:53.435 --> 35:56.194
- all: Butter!
- Cream, cream.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.238
Jonathan:<i> I know that</i>
<i> I can put together a dish.</i>

35:58.282 --> 35:59.948
I'm not going home tonight.
No, sir.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.285
No such thing
as too much cream when you're
cooking southern food.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.496
You put enough
cream and butter in anything,
it's gonna taste good.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.832
Oh, okay.
That's some butter for you.

36:08.834 --> 36:14.171
This is it.
The most important two minutes
of your entire lives.

36:14.214 --> 36:17.215
Those shrimp take seconds
to cook, okay?

36:17.259 --> 36:18.425
Damn.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.551
Watch your sauce.
Watch your sauce.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.344
Oh, ( bleep ).

36:24.266 --> 36:26.892
- Don't overcook
your shrimp, baby.
- ( bleep )

36:26.935 --> 36:28.226
angie: Watch the color.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.303
Okay.

36:30.305 --> 36:31.605
Ae, watch your spice, huh?

36:31.648 --> 36:32.647
Pyet: Not too spicy.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.773
Not too spicy!
I know this.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.651
I love spicy food,
but it doesn't matter!

36:36.695 --> 36:40.655
What matters
is the mentors' taste buds,
not yours!

36:40.699 --> 36:42.908
- Ae, next level, yes?
- Yes?

36:42.951 --> 36:43.909
Next level, yes, chef.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.410
You're gonna put a salad out,
lao-inspired,

36:45.454 --> 36:48.246
trust me,
it needs to be elevated.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.956
Let's go, guys. Come on!

36:50.000 --> 36:52.417
All: Ten, nine, eight,

36:52.461 --> 36:55.212
- seven, six, five...
- Hurry!

36:55.255 --> 36:57.297
- There you go.
- Four, three...

36:57.341 --> 36:59.424
Right over the top.
There you go.
Yes. Perfect, baby.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.885
- Gordon: ...One,
and stop. Well done.
- Good job!

37:01.929 --> 37:03.136
That was insane.

37:05.349 --> 37:09.267
It is possible
that I could eliminate half
of my own team tonight.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.103
<i> No one wants to send one</i>
<i>of their own team members home,</i>

37:12.147 --> 37:13.647
but we're trying to find
the next level chef.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.942
Three outstanding shrimp dishes.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.445
Sadly, only one dish
will make it through

37:20.447 --> 37:22.322
to the next stage
in the competition.

37:22.324 --> 37:25.367
If this goes to a tie,
I'm gonna have to break that.

37:25.410 --> 37:29.329
Let's start off
with the shrimp and brandy.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.791
Looking at all three
of the dishes,
they look all look tasty,

37:33.210 --> 37:36.962
but my dish looks like
the only one that you would get
in a fine dining restaurant.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.172
I know what it takes to win
and I'm not done fighting.

37:39.216 --> 37:42.717
Overall just stunning
to really look at and enjoy.

37:42.761 --> 37:46.054
I love how much shrimp flavor
is in the sauce.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.973
There's a lot of depth to it.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.225
That being said,
shrimp are overcooked.

37:52.104 --> 37:55.021
Let's taste the shrimp
and grits next, please.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.147
Jonathan:
<i> I'm feeling good.</i>

37:56.191 --> 37:57.857
<i> I think my plate</i>
<i> looks delicious.</i>

37:57.901 --> 37:59.442
<i> I know that gravy is good.</i>

37:59.486 --> 38:01.736
I made in the top ten.
I'd love to make it farther.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.532
It's a reading a little bit
saline forward on my palate,

38:05.534 --> 38:07.450
but the shrimp on top
are cooked perfectly.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.036
I'm a fan
of the inspiration here.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.580
I love all the traditional
flavors of the south.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.374
Very rustic, very comforting.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.253
And then the shrimp salad,
please.

38:19.756 --> 38:23.049
There's a lot of confidence
for $250,000 to make a salad.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.259
That's insane.

38:26.096 --> 38:28.888
My dish is vibrant, colorful,

38:28.932 --> 38:31.057
<i> but I'm against</i>
<i> two major competitors.</i>

38:31.101 --> 38:34.019
<i> They're good at what they do.</i>
<i> Who doesn't wanna win?</i>

38:34.021 --> 38:38.481
250k? Mentorship?
I need to stay.

38:38.525 --> 38:41.392
I need show more of my culture.
It's not my time yet.

38:41.403 --> 38:44.112
Nyesha:
I love the level of spice
on this dish.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.780
There's punchy element
coming through.

38:45.824 --> 38:50.285
Whatever vinaigrette
is on this, it's so delicious.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.412
This celery leaf really gives it
a sort of freshness

38:52.456 --> 38:56.082
a great textural contrast.
Very, very authentic.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.295
Three amazing
shrimp inspired dishes.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.630
Richard, I'm gonna come
to you first, please.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.925
The winning dish in your mind?

39:06.928 --> 39:08.219
None of these dishes
are clunkers,

39:08.263 --> 39:10.221
so this is gonna be a matter

39:10.265 --> 39:12.223
of which is the best
of the best?

39:12.267 --> 39:16.436
One in my mind was exceptional.

39:16.438 --> 39:19.147
Had just a great contrast
of textures.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.066
My favorite dish...

39:24.237 --> 39:25.612
...Was the shrimp salad.

39:27.991 --> 39:31.117
It's a salad,
but it's got all of these
bright flavors to it.

39:31.161 --> 39:33.036
<i>It's authentic, it's inspiring.</i>

39:33.038 --> 39:34.496
Delicious food
is delicious food.

39:35.665 --> 39:40.126
Nyesha, which one is it, please?

39:40.128 --> 39:43.588
I want to mentor each and every
one of my team to success.

39:43.590 --> 39:47.175
<i> I can't worry about choosing</i>
<i> which dish I think zach's is.</i>

39:47.219 --> 39:50.220
<i> This has to be about</i>
<i> the best dish in front of me.</i>

39:50.263 --> 39:52.097
In one of these dishes,

39:52.140 --> 39:54.599
this chef communicated
their vision.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.519
For me...

40:02.359 --> 40:03.900
...That's the shrimp salad.

40:03.944 --> 40:08.613
Gordon: Wow. Wow.

40:08.657 --> 40:12.867
- The shrimp salad
created by ae.
- Nyesha: Wow.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.078
- Thank you so much.
- Ae, congratulations,
young lady.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.246
Nyesha: Congratulations, ae.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.959
- Gordon: How do you feel?
- I feel amazing.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.086
I grew up eating this food.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.256
I'm happy that your taste buds
are twerking with mine.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.466
So thank you.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.385
I feel like I made
my lao people proud.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.887
I feel like
we're so underrepresented,

40:32.889 --> 40:36.349
and for me to share my culture,
bring the flavors,

40:36.351 --> 40:40.395
and for the mentors
to appreciate it,
it means the world to me.

40:40.439 --> 40:43.106
Zach, tonight you cooked
with the heart of a lion,

40:43.150 --> 40:45.233
and I can see
the disappointment in your eyes.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.402
But let me tell you,
keep that head up.

40:47.404 --> 40:51.364
- Continue chasing that dream.
- Yes, chef.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.616
I'm definitely walking out here
with my head held high.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.785
I'm grateful to get this far
in the competition.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.787
It's been amazing to mentor you.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.956
I know I pushed you hard,
but that's my job, right?

40:59.958 --> 41:02.333
I'm super blessed to even be
in this position right now
even though I lost.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.419
You did amazing.

41:04.463 --> 41:07.005
Jonathan, I mean,
it's been a pleasure.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.339
- Thank you.
- You know what you're doing.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.133
You're gonna go
wherever you wanna go.

41:10.177 --> 41:12.218
Thank you so much
for being my mentor.

41:12.262 --> 41:14.095
I appreciate it so much.
It was a pleasure.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.806
Chef arrington,
I have a 12-year-old sister.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.100
I'm so glad
that there are women like you
for her to look up to

41:19.102 --> 41:24.606
who are strong and confident
in what they are doing
but exude kindness.

41:24.649 --> 41:28.026
It's such a special moment
to be recognized.

41:28.069 --> 41:31.279
<i> That literally validates</i>
<i> the reason why I cook</i>

41:31.323 --> 41:33.823
and I choose to mentor chefs.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.951
That soulfulness
that you bring to your food
is very inspiring.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.078
Alabama is lucky to have you.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.246
Thank you, chef.

41:40.624 --> 41:44.834
I came here
to push the south forward,
and I did that.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.295
<i> I had some great days here,</i>
<i> and I got to come here</i>

41:47.339 --> 41:49.005
and learn from some
of the best in the world.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.840
It's only up from here.

41:50.884 --> 41:53.843
- Good night. Well done.
- Both: Thank you, chefs.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.013
- Hey, we made it
to the top ten, man.
- That's right, dude.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.139
That's right.

41:59.142 --> 42:01.851
All of you,
here's the good news.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.186
You've all made it
to the top eight.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.981
- Man!
- Great eight.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.150
But listen carefully.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.196
Everything you know
about this competition...

42:13.198 --> 42:15.031
Oh, no. Oh, gosh.

42:15.033 --> 42:19.285
...Is about to change.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.540
Get some rest.
You're gonna need it.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.125
- All: Yes, chef.
- Ae, well done. Good night.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.171
Tricia:<i> I'm scared!</i>

42:30.215 --> 42:32.549
Pyet:<i> Oh, gosh,</i>
<i> this can't be good.</i>

42:37.013 --> 42:38.846
<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:38.932 --> 42:41.182
It's time to remove
those aprons.

42:41.226 --> 42:44.894
From now on, you'll be
battling it out all alone.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.146
Ae: Teams are
no longer existing!

42:47.190 --> 42:49.691
Everybody's gunning
for each other. It's wartime.

42:49.734 --> 42:53.111
- I can outcook these chefs.
- I'm freaking ( bleep ) out.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.946
Pyet: At this point,
I don't even know
what I'm gonna do.

42:54.990 --> 42:58.199
- Tricia, don't overdo it!
- Pyet: I put so much
of myself into this.

42:58.243 --> 43:00.326
It's more than
a competition for me.

43:00.370 --> 43:01.869
Kenny:
I got my kids to make proud.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.329
I don't wanna do good.
I wanna win.

43:03.373 --> 43:05.582
Your climb to the top
starts today.

43:05.625 --> 43:06.624
( sighs )
