00:01.001 --> 00:02.703
ADULT ADAM:
Ah, '80s video stores.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.238
They were heaven
for movie lovers,

00:04.305 --> 00:05.606
no matter what
you wanted to watch.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.176
And for me,
I wanted college comedies,

00:08.242 --> 00:10.044
like Back to School.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.579
Hey, Dad,
when you were in college,

00:11.645 --> 00:13.314
did you ever build a Jacuzzi
in your dorm room?

00:13.381 --> 00:15.183
No.
...or Real Genius...

00:15.249 --> 00:16.550
Hey, Dad,
did you ever use a laser

00:16.617 --> 00:18.152
to fill a house
with popcorn?
No.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.920
...and of course,
Animal House.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.190
Hey, Dad, ever put a
horse in your crusty
old dean's office?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.724
Will you pick a movie
already?

00:23.791 --> 00:26.194
I got Chinese food
stinking up the car!

00:26.260 --> 00:27.328
Revenge of the Nerds
it is.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.762
I hear the 10th viewing

00:28.829 --> 00:30.598
is when you really start
noticing the nuances.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.333
ADULT ADAM: While I was living
the fantasy of college life,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.402
my sister was living
in the harsh reality.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.871
"F"? Wait. Um, Professor?
How is this even possible?

00:37.938 --> 00:40.741
Oh, well, that's easy.
You weren't here for it.

00:40.808 --> 00:44.545
Son of a...
While true, not my fault.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.314
See, I've been intensely
focusing on my music

00:46.380 --> 00:47.648
instead of school work.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.117
Sounds like
it's completely your fault.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.718
Please, I cannot fail
Intro to Film.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.221
Well, I suppose on the off
chance you aced your midterm,

00:53.287 --> 00:54.988
you might pull your grade up
to a D minus.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.525
Yes! I'm back in the game.
Great.
It's due tomorrow morning.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.760
Oh, that's not
gonna work for me.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.028
A bit of good news.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.396
I booked my first
real gig tonight,

01:02.463 --> 01:03.931
the big kegger
at Kappa Mu.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.234
It turns out that the Styx
cover band "Twygs" bailed

01:06.300 --> 01:07.668
and they found my flyer
in the trash.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.203
Well, that changes
everything.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.004
Except your grade,
which is still an "F."

01:11.071 --> 01:13.107
No, no, no, no.
All good.
Good luck.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.475
Oh, I don't need it.

01:14.542 --> 01:19.046
I am gonna ace this sucker,
because I love movies.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.514
Who do I know
who loves movies?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.049
ADULT ADAM:
One person jumped to mind.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.452
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYS)

01:24.518 --> 01:26.887
Me! I was a legit,
die-hard film geek

01:26.954 --> 01:30.558
who obsessed over every little
detail of every single movie.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.426
Clap your hands,
everybody...

01:32.493 --> 01:34.862
ALL:
* And, everybody,
clap your hands

01:34.928 --> 01:38.666
* We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and...Omega Mu

01:38.732 --> 01:41.269
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
* And we've come here
on stage tonight

01:41.335 --> 01:42.970
* To do our show for you

01:43.036 --> 01:44.672
Uh, yello?

01:44.738 --> 01:47.275
Oh, thank God.
Just the wonderful man
I was looking for.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.742
You do know this
is Adam, right?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.644
Of course.
I was just calling
to check in

01:50.711 --> 01:52.646
on my handsome guy
who knows how to type.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.182
Speaking of,
do you know anything

01:54.248 --> 01:55.849
about the movie
Blade Runner?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.652
Y-You're jumping around a ton,
but it's one of my favorites.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.388
Come visit right now.
Seriously?

02:00.454 --> 02:03.457
Totally.
I miss you, like, so much.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.992
That makes my heart happy.
Okay, great.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.961
Get your little tush on a bus,
'kay? Bye-bye now.

02:08.028 --> 02:10.764
Did your sister just
invite us all to college?

02:10.831 --> 02:12.933
Let the roller coast
of self discovery begin.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.869
If you guys are coming,
you've got to play it cool.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.037
The coolest.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.506
We're going to college!

02:18.572 --> 02:19.773
ALL: Aha!

02:24.212 --> 02:26.514
ADULT ADAM:
It was October 18,
1980-something,

02:26.580 --> 02:28.716
an otherwise average morning
in the Goldberg house...

02:28.782 --> 02:31.385
until this happened.
(CHUCKLES) I did it.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.187
I worked the computer
all by myself

02:33.254 --> 02:35.423
and made my first
official resume.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.824
What do you need
a resume for?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.726
Da-doi.
For the Bevolution,

02:38.792 --> 02:42.196
my new chapter in life
where I move beyond
being a mom

02:42.263 --> 02:44.265
and start tying new things,
like saying "Da-doi."

02:44.332 --> 02:45.699
Doesn't work.
Just horrible.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.000
And now I know.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.702
But you already have a job.
You sub at the school.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.904
Please, I only did that
so I could stalk the kids

02:50.971 --> 02:52.440
during school hours.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.608
You swore taking that job
had nothing to do with us.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.878
I was lying. Da-doi.
Nope, still doesn't work.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.180
Point is, that job
was all about you.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.616
The Bevolution
is all about me.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.452
Okay, you wanna change?
I got it.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.821
Instead of parming shrimp,
parm some delicious crab.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.624
Or some of the big shrimp.
You know, the big ones?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.626
You dip them
into the red sauce.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.495
The big ones.
They're thicker and bigger.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.498
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to help your wife!

03:17.565 --> 03:21.101
The jumbo kind of shrimp,
you know, you eat them cold,

03:21.168 --> 03:23.103
you dip them
into cocktail sauce.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.905
Please stop talking
about big shrimp.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.575
I need real ideas
for my next big move.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.377
What do I do?
Who do I become?

03:29.443 --> 03:31.479
Oh, I know.
A whale trainer.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.547
Your mother doesn't even like
to get her hair wet.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.249
She's not gonna ride
some stupid orca.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.917
Orcas are the nursemaids
of the sea.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.819
What do you know?
We went to SeaWorld once.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.689
Big Tasty knows everything
there is about whales.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.458
You tell me something I don't
know about those dumb fish

03:44.525 --> 03:46.360
and I'll leave you alone.
One thing.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.029
Did you know whales
age in reverse?

03:49.096 --> 03:50.230
That's what you know?

03:50.298 --> 03:51.965
Shame on you
for wasting my time.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.200
Shame on both of you.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.668
I'm trying to change
my life here.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.971
So am I. All this talk
about shrimp and whales

03:58.038 --> 04:01.275
has gotten me pumped up
to start a Barry-o-lution.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.510
What are you talking about?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.879
Last year, I had Lainey
and I was popular.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.681
This year, I'm garbage.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.818
If Mom can change,
so can I.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.185
See what you started?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.188
What I've started is a journey
towards personal growth.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.291
And if you won't help me
figure it out,

04:17.358 --> 04:19.460
I'll go to someone
who will.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.296
John, I'm embarking
on a Bevolution.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.064
I would like you
to be my guide.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.466
This will, without a doubt,

04:25.533 --> 04:27.701
be the most important meeting
of your life.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.703
Um, I'm already
in a meeting.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.305
It's cool.
I'll leave.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.606
It's just,
for the first time ever,

04:32.673 --> 04:33.907
I was thinking about
going to college.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.410
Please leave.
That's the point, John.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.811
If the Bevolution
is successful,

04:37.878 --> 04:39.980
I won't be a sub
here anymore.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.382
As in, y-you'd quit?

04:41.449 --> 04:42.683
Sadly, if I get another job,

04:42.750 --> 04:44.752
I shall never grace
these halls again.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.586
Atkins, out.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.220
This is on me
for opening up.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.923
My God. It's always been my
dream as a guidance counselor

04:49.990 --> 04:52.360
to actually one day
guide somebody.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.827
What's next?

04:53.894 --> 04:54.828
Read this.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.831
"What Color
is Your Parachute?"

04:57.898 --> 04:59.266
I don't know.

04:59.333 --> 05:03.236
"A practical manual for job
hunters and career changers."

05:03.303 --> 05:04.838
And from what I've read
on the back cover,

05:04.905 --> 05:06.874
a lot of people think
it's a game changer.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.443
ADULT ADAM:
As my mom buckled up
for some big life changes,

05:09.510 --> 05:12.780
my friends and I were ready
for the college weekend
of a lifetime.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.848
Uh, what's with
the freak show?

05:14.915 --> 05:16.417
I brought my whole crew.
Thought they could share
in the weekend's

05:16.484 --> 05:17.885
Animal House style
shenanigans.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.319
Can you point us
to the nearest

05:19.387 --> 05:21.321
bikini car wash/
anti-war-protest?

05:21.389 --> 05:22.890
Uh, yeah,
maybe in a few hours.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.658
I've got this paper
on Blade Runner.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.461
What? You get to write papers
on the best movies ever?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.597
Yep. Just seven
more pages left.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.331
Should be done by morning.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.933
Well,
what if we helped?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.536
Really?
You'd help me by sitting
here and writing it for me?

05:35.603 --> 05:36.704
That's a brilliant idea.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.005
I do have
many strong opinions

05:38.071 --> 05:40.107
about Harrison Ford's
treatment of replicants.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.975
I call footnotes.
Great.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.211
You work and I'll go
get a fresh batch of
books from the library.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.780
Let me just get this musical
equipment out of your way.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.649
Seriously, Erica,
it means so much

05:48.716 --> 05:50.117
that you asked me down here
to hang.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.485
So much.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.953
Yeah, it's really worked out
for all of us.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.722
You are such
good person.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.724
See?
The weird kid gets it.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.493
Look. Jolt Cola.
We can stay up for days.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.962
Fine by me.
Just write the paper.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.398
Attention, JTP.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.599
ALL: JTP!

06:05.666 --> 06:08.402
The time has come
for a Barry-o-lution.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.404
I don't have time
to explain what that means,

06:10.471 --> 06:14.475
but I am guaranteed
to be the sexiest man
in all of Jenkintown

06:14.542 --> 06:16.510
after my awesome
transformation.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.245
I think you should be happy
with the way you are.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.413
You're amazing, man.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.915
Save your kind words,
Matthew!

06:21.982 --> 06:23.917
I was up all night

06:23.984 --> 06:27.788
studying the coolest specimens
in the history of mankind.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.724
As you can see,
they have one thing in common.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.293
Behold their untamed
curly locks.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.428
Whoa.
He's right.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.096
He cracked the code.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.699
According to my calculations,
if I join this exclusive club,

06:38.766 --> 06:42.670
I am guaranteed
to have the greatest
senior year in history.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.071
Dude, that's impossible.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.739
You can't just go out
and get Bon Jovi hair.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.075
Can't I, Naked Robert?

06:48.141 --> 06:49.142
The Toni Home Perm.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.711
My uncle uses that,

06:50.778 --> 06:52.980
and he once got confused
for John Oates at the airport.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.381
My point is proven.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.249
Time for the Barry-o-lution
to begin.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.251
The directions say the longer
we leave the curlers in,

06:58.318 --> 06:59.553
the tighter the perm
will be.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.490
Like the saying goes,
more curls, more girls.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.857
I don't think
that's a saying, dude.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.126
Do it.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.896
You are gonna love
how the pain makes
you feel pretty.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.599
I can feel the beauty
burning into my scalp.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.934
Hear ye, hear ye!

07:14.001 --> 07:16.770
I've just finished the first
two chapters of a book,

07:16.837 --> 07:19.172
and I've decided
I'm going to go
to night school

07:19.239 --> 07:20.641
and start a career.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.442
Yes! This is such an exciting
day for everyone.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.945
Did you say, uh,
you're gonna go
to night school?

07:25.012 --> 07:26.980
That's right.
School at night.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.017
But isn't night
when we have dinner
and watch TV

07:30.083 --> 07:31.752
and then have dessert
and watch TV?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.987
You can watch Airwolf
without me.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.924
Also cook and tidy up and help
the kids with their homework.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.626
ADULT ADAM:
In that moment,

07:38.692 --> 07:40.093
my dad knew in order
to maintain his easy life,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.162
he'd have to divert
my mom's focus.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.631
So, he improvised.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.334
Look, I love everything
that you're saying.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.738
But why change a little,
when you can change a lot?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.606
That's right.
I'm talking hair.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.943
My hair?
Yeah, everyone knows
your giant, golden hair-dome.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.477
It's your thing.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.047
Well, I have had this
exact hair since
I was a tiny baby.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.515
Well, you know
what they say,

08:01.582 --> 08:03.551
"Real change starts
on the outside."

08:03.617 --> 08:05.753
(SIGHS) I have heard
something like that.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.689
It's true. Why just spend
all that time at night school

08:08.756 --> 08:11.324
when, in just one night,
you can change everything.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.561
ADULT ADAM:
And so, my dad
convinced my mom

08:13.627 --> 08:17.865
to kick off the Bevolution
with a bigger, bolder,
and curlier change.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.067
Oh! (BLEEP)

08:20.133 --> 08:21.869
Is that good or bad?
It's bad, right?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.403
I can feel it
still tightening.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.504
No, no. I love it.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.207
Really?
I look like Babs?

08:27.274 --> 08:28.809
Total Streisand.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.580
You look like a...
a beautiful bag of springs.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.782
I knew it.
(GROWLS)

08:34.848 --> 08:36.016
The dog seems agitated.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.818
Yeah,
Lucky doesn't like change.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.320
But I do.
Love the change.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.655
Thank you so much,
sweetie.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.824
I'm gonna make you
your favorite dinner,

08:43.891 --> 08:45.893
cheesy sausage casserole.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.628
Hoo-hoo! Everybody wins.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.063
ADULT ADAM:
While my dad encouraged
my mom's curly mop,

08:50.130 --> 08:52.465
my friends and I were soaking
in a crazy college night.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.235
Stop crowding me, guys.
Everyone's voice
will be heard.

08:55.302 --> 08:58.872
Oh, barf, you're here already?
Where's your sister?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.709
ADAM: She's in a towel.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.176
Like, hello?

09:03.243 --> 09:05.813
I have a girlfriend.
I don't.
I'm Dave Kim. 'Sup?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.014
Not now, Dave Kim.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.782
Um, she said
she'd be right back.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.550
Really? I thought she was
playing at Kappa Mu tonight?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.653
Wait. She went
to a party without us?
Why would she do that?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.723
I'm thinking if she
didn't tell you, maybe
I shouldn't, either.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.058
But it's gonna be
ba-nanas.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.059
Bye.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.628
So, Erica didn't
miss me at all?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.696
She's only using me
for my nerdery?

09:22.763 --> 09:25.132
Sorry, man. Guess it was
too good to be true.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.434
Maybe it still
can be true.
How so?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.137
Well, if we know one thing
from our favorite college
movie,

09:30.203 --> 09:33.173
it's that nerds
always get their revenge.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.709
It might be the Jolt Cola
coursing through my body,

09:35.776 --> 09:38.912
but I am
an unstoppable force.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.547
Gahhhh!

09:40.614 --> 09:43.083
Okay, here's the Kappa house
as I see it in my head.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.718
Here's the Jell-O
wrestling ring,

09:44.785 --> 09:46.820
the beer fountain,
the baby-oil wrestling pool,

09:46.887 --> 09:49.022
dry T-shirt storage
for wet T-shirt contests,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.524
and finally,
the pillow-fighting pit.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.894
ALL: Whoa.
Maintain focus.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.463
We then proceed past Erica,
up the back stairs,

09:56.529 --> 09:57.898
and you know
what happens then.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.868
Oh, yes. Pantry raid.
Yes.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.136
Wait, what?
We steal their
precious food?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.205
Dude,
it's not a pantry raid.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.507
In the movie,
they steal underpants.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.642
Just follow me.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.077
If we stay low
and move fast,

10:10.143 --> 10:12.045
this will be the greatest
night of our lives.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.048
Time to show college
what we're made of, gentlemen.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.219
ADULT ADAM:
Barry had permed himself up

10:19.286 --> 10:21.488
and couldn't wait for
his new 'do to do its magic.

10:21.554 --> 10:25.225
I don't know.
My perm just doesn't
seem that perm-y.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.028
I'm gonna be real
here. Your hair looks
exactly the same.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.664
Yeah, like a Brillo pad
went to town on a lasagna pan.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.132
Or the beginning stages
of a Chia Pet.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.934
I've always seen it
as a jacked-up bird's nest.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.603
Well, I will never live a life
with semi-curly hair.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.338
I must go bigger.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.673
"Industrial Hair Tightener?"

10:39.740 --> 10:42.075
According to the sassy lady
at the beauty store,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.845
this is the strongest
perm solution on the market.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.147
It also says it's
the premier cosmetic product

10:47.214 --> 10:48.248
for show horses.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.851
Indeed. Directions say
15 minutes max.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.686
I'll double that and go 50.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.254
Dude, do not do that.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.657
Oh, it's done. I'm going
where no perm has gone before.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.959
Looking good, Schmoo.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.028
No one likes a show-off,
Mom.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.164
ADULT ADAM: Yep, my mom's new
curly 'do had her so confident

11:04.231 --> 11:06.299
that she decided she didn't
need anyone else's help.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.634
Sweet Medusa.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.037
I'm here to return your book,
John. I don't need it.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.672
As you can see, I've already
made some huge changes.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.975
Uh, yeah, it, uh,
draws the eye.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.210
Oh, you noticed my permanent.
You like?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.679
Um, I guess
I have to say yes.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.248
Well, why are you looking
at the floor?

11:21.314 --> 11:23.016
Hmm? Am I?
Well, now you're
looking at the wall.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.753
Now you're looking
everywhere but my hair.
Hmm?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.088
I'll have you know
my husband loves my hair.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.489
Really?
Well, your husband has

11:29.556 --> 11:31.725
a very casual relationship
with the truth.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.062
How dare you.
Why would he lie to my face?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.830
Uh, survival?
Doesn't matter.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.266
I feel as good
as this perm looks.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.069
Okay, well, I wish you
a speedy recovery.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.738
You know what?
Let's get an honest opinion.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.140
Thoughts?
You were so hot,
Mrs. G.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.242
Why'd you have to do it?
Why?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.846
Know what? Change is bad.
Screw college.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.818
Aah.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.319
ADULT ADAM:
Meanwhile, over on campus,

11:59.386 --> 12:01.922
me and my pals
were ready for action.

12:01.989 --> 12:03.356
Under cover of night,

12:03.423 --> 12:06.059
we'd set off on a big-time
revenge mission.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.095
Yep, inspired by
the classic scene

12:08.161 --> 12:10.697
from Revenge of the Nerds,
we'd raid a sorority house.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.900
But when it was finally time
to leap into action,

12:12.966 --> 12:17.905
reality set in, and we just
felt...uncomfortable
and weird.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.107
Now what?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.642
I guess we rifle through their
drawers and steal underpants?

12:22.709 --> 12:24.011
Um...now that
we're actually here,

12:24.077 --> 12:25.445
it kind of feels weird
and invasive.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.414
It felt much more lighthearted
in the movie.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.549
If someone stole
my private stuff,
I'd feel super violated.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.786
I'd call the police.
I mean, it's a legit crime.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.354
Well, we need
to get revenge somehow.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.390
ADULT ADAM: And we did,
but in our own dorky way.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.926
Pantry raid!

12:38.992 --> 12:41.328
Oh, man, they have
Fruit Roll-Ups and
Donkey Kong cereal?

12:41.394 --> 12:42.863
My mom never buys
this stuff.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.832
Dude. SpaghettiOs.
Score.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.600
Shark Bites.
College is awesome.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.971
Ew. There are
high-school nerds
in the pantry!

12:52.005 --> 12:54.207
Ah, there you are,
Curly Q.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.344
Uh, the, uh,
sausage casserole...

12:57.410 --> 12:59.179
I was just wondering
where it was.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.415
Oh, I'm not gonna casserole
anything for you, ever again.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.818
That's a crazy thing to say.
What's going on with you?

13:04.885 --> 13:06.319
I know, Murray.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.089
You tried to derail
the Bevolution with a perm.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.557
You don't even like it.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.995
It's me, Murray, your big guy.
I love your perm.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.064
Eh, it's fine.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.299
Everyone help Barry.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.869
My head feels like
it's covered in lava.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.103
Not now, moron.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.771
I know you hate
the perm, Murray.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.173
You only told me that

13:26.239 --> 13:27.941
so I wouldn't disrupt
your life by growing.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.678
I promised my hair
I'd go 50 minutes,
but it's only been 10.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.013
You're an adult lady.
(GROANS)

13:33.080 --> 13:35.082
You don't need to grow.
You'll be fine.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.584
It's so hot.
No, it's not fine.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.053
In three years, all our kids
will be out of the house,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.421
and I'll have nothing.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.123
You'll have me.
Why can't that be enough?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.391
It's so hot and so cold.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.759
I like our life
the way it is, Bevy.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.261
I like us.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.130
And if you go changing,
where does that leave me?

13:50.197 --> 13:51.831
This isn't about you.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.134
For once, this was
about what I wanted.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.802
Ooh. Ice-cream sandwiches.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.406
Fine. Forget the hair, okay?
Just go up and wash it out.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.341
It's a perm, Murray.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.675
It's permanent.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.778
Why do you think
they call it a perm?
Da-doi.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.883
Wait. This is permanent?
So, the pain will never stop?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.584
Well, you got
what you wanted.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.654
The only thing that's ever
gonna change about me

14:14.721 --> 14:16.924
is my stupid hair.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.031
My head's numb.
I'm fine now.
Yeah.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.598
Hello, Kappas.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.168
I am Riki Gold, and this is
the Riki Gold Experience.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.371
I hear you love some Styx?
Any requests?

14:31.438 --> 14:32.539
Play Mr. Roboto!

14:32.605 --> 14:36.910
Come Sail Away it is.
And two, three, crap.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.478
Erica.
Oh, thank God.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.313
You know this little
pantry raider?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.548
Oh, gross.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.384
Wait, did you say pantry?
Like, in a kitchen?

14:44.451 --> 14:45.953
Help me.
They called the campus cops.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.454
There's tow of them coming
in a golf cart.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.956
I can't handle
that kind of heat.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.890
Okay,
this was a mistake.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.926
So, why don't you just take
your little friends

14:52.993 --> 14:55.062
and your guitar
back to the dorm, okay?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.363
Thanks a lot.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.231
Are you seriously blaming me
for this?

14:58.298 --> 15:00.800
You dragged me up her
to write your stupid paper.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.335
It's complicated, okay?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.804
No, it's as clear as day.
You don't miss me.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.573
You don't even care
about me.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.241
That is not true.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.377
I just have a lot of
important stuff
to worry about.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.578
(SCOFFS) Wow.

15:11.644 --> 15:12.946
Gimme a break, okay?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.614
College isn't anything
like how it is

15:14.681 --> 15:16.483
in those stupid movies
that you love.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.285
In real life,
it is impossible.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.553
Then you should have
just asked for my help.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.722
I would've had your back.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.159
Too bad you can't ever do
the same when it comes to me.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.301
ADULT ADAM: After my
Revenge of the Nerds
plan went bust,

15:34.367 --> 15:37.237
we had no choice
but to cut our fantasy
college weekend short.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.007
Unbelievable. All those
college movies lied to us.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.642
Back to School,
Soul Man, Animal House.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.112
I didn't see one toga
the entire weekend.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.546
And, honestly,

15:46.613 --> 15:47.947
how can Rodney Dangerfield
have a hot tub in his dorm?

15:48.015 --> 15:49.549
It would be
plumbing nightmare.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.852
Wait. Just give me
a minute, okay?

15:52.919 --> 15:54.154
She came back for me.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.355
You guys go ahead.
I live in D.C. now.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.390
Ew. No.
I'm here for him.
Me?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.327
No. Look, you're all
standing in a clump.
I'm here for Adam.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.961
Got another paper
for me to write?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.497
Look, I don't want
you leaving, thinking
that I don't miss you.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.398
But you don't.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.799
I don't hear from you
for months,

16:06.866 --> 16:08.668
and when I finally do,
it's just to trick me.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.771
I don't ever call because
it's been a disaster, dude.

16:11.838 --> 16:15.275
I can't keep up with classes,
my music's going nowhere.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.211
I'm on my own,
and I just can't keep up.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.747
No. You're not on your own.
You got me.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.383
And me.
Timing, Dave Kim!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.785
What I mean is,
maybe I can still help.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.556
That party was my last shot
at getting on track
at college.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.523
It's over.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.425
No.
I refuse to believe that.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.095
And I refuse to believe
all those college movies lied.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.164
But we all agreed they did
like 30 seconds ago.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.666
No, Chad Kremp.
To you, I say no.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.701
Okay, okay.
We're all on the
same team here.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.671
I'm tired of you
tearing us down, Chad Kremp.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.938
Not this time.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.940
Whoa. Why am I suddenly
the bad guy?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.376
Don't you see?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.777
The problem hasn't been
that the movies lied,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.345
it's that we didn't
believe in them enough.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.214
I don't want to be
a Chad Kremp about this,

16:54.281 --> 16:55.682
but I'm not sure
I follow.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.650
I think there's a way
Erica can get her gig back

16:57.717 --> 17:00.420
and we can live out our
favorite college movie
for real.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.055
At this point,
I'm game for anything.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.290
Then it's on.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.024
Sergei, did you bring
your violin?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.459
Always.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.430
This party
is lamesville.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.932
I only came here
because Twygs was playing.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.201
I even have
their T-shirt.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.668
I don't know you.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.170
I drove you here.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.406
(POP IN DISTANCE)
ADULT ADAM:
Little did they know,

17:19.472 --> 17:21.108
a rag-tag band
of endearing dweebs

17:21.174 --> 17:22.775
was about to
blow their minds.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.744
And much like the finale
of Revenge of the Nerds,

17:24.811 --> 17:27.780
we put all our
geeky skills to use.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.782
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

17:40.627 --> 17:42.495
* Clap your hands, everybody

17:42.562 --> 17:45.265
* And, everybody,
clap your hands

17:45.332 --> 17:47.567
* We're a band
of high-school geeks

17:47.634 --> 17:49.369
* Who have come
to rock a rhyme

17:49.436 --> 17:51.871
* We got Davey Kim
on the beat we made

17:51.938 --> 17:54.241
* And we're sorry
'bout doin' that pantry raid

17:54.307 --> 17:56.576
* We got Chad Presley,
he's sty-ah-lin'

17:56.643 --> 17:58.645
* And my main man Sergei
on the violin

17:58.711 --> 18:01.381
* If you like our sound,
let me hear ya scream

18:01.448 --> 18:04.851
* 'Cause we're finally livin'
our college dream *

18:04.917 --> 18:07.554
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, our college dream
had officially come true.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.456
(BOOING)

18:09.522 --> 18:10.557
Or not.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.858
I don't get it.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.660
College movies taught us
that an epic musical
rap finale

18:13.726 --> 18:16.062
performed by underdogs
would win over any crowd.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.265
It didn't, man.
It did the opposite.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.534
Get off the stage!
Whoo. Okay.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.305
Hope everyone
enjoyed that amazing,
but brief, opening act.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.840
So, who's ready
for some Styx?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.642
Play Mr. Roboto!

18:29.709 --> 18:31.178
Come Sail Away it is.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.813
(CHEERING)

18:33.880 --> 18:40.353
* I'm sailing away

18:42.889 --> 18:48.561
* Set an open course
for the virgin sea

18:50.096 --> 18:55.435
* I've got to be free

18:58.971 --> 19:02.342
Here.
I got you something.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.511
Not interested.
Just open it.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.086
What is this?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.588
Business cards.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.724
But I don't even know
what I'm gonna do yet.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.958
But you will.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.794
And when you do,
you're gonna be amazing at it.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.062
Aww, Mur.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.064
Look, I love our life.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.333
I don't want to lose
what we have.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.701
I'm happy
right here with you.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.771
But I'm at the
point in my life
where I need more.

19:31.838 --> 19:36.309
And...I'm scared, too.
But I-I got to do this.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.812
Okay. You do it.
Whatever it takes.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.147
Even night school?

19:41.214 --> 19:43.216
Means you're gonna be
on your own for a few dinners.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.218
So I'll order some pizza.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.954
You go follow your dreams.
It's a win-win.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.624
ADULT ADAM: With that, my dad
fully embraced the Bevolution.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.660
And thanks to Erica's
insane musical talent,

19:53.726 --> 19:56.429
me and my friends
finally got to live out
our crazy college weekend.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.766
ERICA:
* ...carry on

19:59.832 --> 20:07.307
* A gathering of angels
appeared above my head

20:07.374 --> 20:09.276
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
sometimes it takes

20:09.342 --> 20:11.411
losing sight
of the ones you love

20:11.478 --> 20:13.380
in order to really see them.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.549
* They said, "Come sail away,
come sail away

20:16.616 --> 20:20.086
* Come sail away with me

20:20.152 --> 20:22.655
ADULT ADAM: Yeah, it's easy
to be afraid of change.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.024
This is so much better
than the movies!

20:25.091 --> 20:26.493
But when you face your fears,

20:26.559 --> 20:28.561
the future doesn't seem
so scary...

20:28.628 --> 20:30.797
* Come sail away,
come sail away

20:30.863 --> 20:33.366
...'cause when family's
fully on board,

20:33.433 --> 20:35.735
that's when your life
really sets sail.

20:35.802 --> 20:40.440
* Come sail away,
come sail away with me

20:40.507 --> 20:43.543
* Come sail away,
come sail away

20:43.610 --> 20:46.946
* Come sail away with me

20:47.013 --> 20:50.483
* Come sail away,
come sail away

20:50.550 --> 20:54.721
* Come sail away with me

20:58.591 --> 21:00.059
I don't understand.

21:00.126 --> 21:04.731
I wanted lush, bouncy curls,
but it just won't work.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.865
Don't sweat it.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.434
We'll still let you be
a part of the JTP.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.402
Which now stands for
the Jenkintown perms.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.803
ALL: JTP!

21:10.870 --> 21:12.705
The curliest crew around.
Aw, yeah, we are.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.375
Everyone, look.
And laugh.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.144
They gave each other
home perms like losers.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.847
You look like
a bunch of Q-tips
farted out a Slinky.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.882
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:22.949 --> 21:24.684
We've made
a terrible mistake.

21:24.751 --> 21:28.588
Thank God those chemicals
don't work on my awesome hair.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.957
Oh, no.
