00:00.863 --> 00:02.187
(Regan) Previously on "Hunters."

00:02.292 --> 00:03.238
(Jackson) Abby Carroll,

00:03.376 --> 00:05.371
reported missing less than 24 hours

00:05.510 --> 00:07.613
after her picture was
sent to the Mexican cell.

00:07.678 --> 00:10.283
She's also married to an FBI agent.

00:10.349 --> 00:12.185
You think terrorists kidnapped my wife.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.983
She's a piano teacher.

00:15.297 --> 00:17.456
(Jackson) The terrorists we're
chasing aren't human.

00:17.523 --> 00:19.058
(screaming)

00:19.123 --> 00:20.192
You're one of them.

00:20.259 --> 00:22.428
I tore that woman to
shreds like an animal.

00:22.494 --> 00:23.696
I need the treatment.

00:23.762 --> 00:24.763
(machine buzzing)

00:24.829 --> 00:25.997
The treatment weakens you.

00:26.064 --> 00:27.533
I need you strong.

00:27.599 --> 00:29.035
I won't let them have another one.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.503
(baby crying, bone snapping)

00:30.568 --> 00:32.804
The baby's not breathing, help me!

00:32.870 --> 00:34.206
(Flynn) They took my wife.

00:34.273 --> 00:35.608
Or your wife's a Hunter.

00:35.674 --> 00:37.710
Where the hell are they?!

00:37.776 --> 00:39.912
Strieber Self Storage.

00:39.977 --> 00:41.513
Near the farmhouse.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.082
Unit 470.

00:55.528 --> 00:58.731
(groans, panting)

01:39.505 --> 01:42.642
(Jackson) Then we're
certain the body is entirely human?

01:42.707 --> 01:44.142
(Dr. James) From what
I can observe, yes.

01:44.209 --> 01:45.569
But I can't perform a full autopsy

01:45.611 --> 01:47.312
until the subject's thawed.

01:48.814 --> 01:50.716
You mean, Abby.

01:50.781 --> 01:53.118
She's not a fu... subject.

01:55.254 --> 01:57.422
She's my wife.

01:57.489 --> 02:00.425
(Dr. James) I'm afraid we can't
determine that yet either, Flynn.

02:00.492 --> 02:02.695
A human body takes 72
hours to freeze solid.

02:02.761 --> 02:05.031
So, we know this victim
died more than three days ago.

02:05.097 --> 02:09.401
Beyond that, we can't determine
time of death until the autopsy.

02:09.467 --> 02:13.072
So, she could've been
killed months ago, even years.

02:13.137 --> 02:15.907
The Abby you know may
not have been human.

02:15.974 --> 02:18.778
Do you people realize
how ridiculous you sound?

02:18.844 --> 02:20.446
(Dr. James) Not so ridiculous.

02:20.512 --> 02:22.648
If the Hunters have been
using tissue samples

02:22.714 --> 02:24.150
to assume human form.

02:24.215 --> 02:26.052
No, they kidnapped Abby,

02:26.118 --> 02:29.922
a human so they could kill her.

02:31.155 --> 02:32.591
And then use her...

02:32.657 --> 02:34.226
It's just a theory, Flynn.

02:34.292 --> 02:35.460
There's no way to prove it yet.

02:35.526 --> 02:36.895
Sure there is.

02:38.998 --> 02:39.832
Thaw Abby's body.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.534
- We can't rush it.
- Like hell.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.436
Just thaw the body.

02:44.502 --> 02:48.340
Figure out... how long she's been dead.

02:49.475 --> 02:50.977
Get some heaters in here.

02:53.946 --> 02:56.749
Please, I need to know.

02:56.815 --> 02:58.484
If we introduce
external sources of heat,

02:58.549 --> 03:01.786
it could damage the
tissue and affect test results.

03:01.852 --> 03:03.488
Then we wait.

03:04.589 --> 03:06.057
It's been a long day, Flynn.

03:06.124 --> 03:07.626
Go home, be with Emme.

03:07.692 --> 03:10.730
(quiet sobbing)

03:15.400 --> 03:17.236
That's my wife.

03:18.870 --> 03:20.505

03:25.276 --> 03:28.179
(woman) How long you been home?

03:28.245 --> 03:30.215
A few months.

03:30.281 --> 03:32.317
So, what was it like?

03:32.383 --> 03:34.185
- What?
- The war.

03:34.251 --> 03:35.720
Was it scary?

03:37.322 --> 03:41.293
Did you see any,
like, real live terrorists?

03:41.359 --> 03:43.796
Did you ever kill anyone?

03:43.862 --> 03:46.698
No.

03:46.764 --> 03:49.501
It was just a bunch of camels and shit.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.904
It was awesome, awesome.

03:56.742 --> 03:59.411
Do you wanna get out of here?

03:59.477 --> 04:01.613
I've got to use the little girls' room.

04:01.679 --> 04:04.016
Then I think we should go.

04:05.184 --> 04:07.585

04:46.090 --> 04:48.193
The O's just tied the game.

04:48.259 --> 04:50.195
Leaving the bar now is sacrilege.

04:50.261 --> 04:53.198
The baseball gods demand
that you stay put.

04:53.265 --> 04:55.534
(chuckling)

04:55.600 --> 04:56.969
Abby.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.671
I'll ride the pine with ya.

04:59.905 --> 05:01.207
Flynn.

05:01.273 --> 05:04.176
Garcon, what he's having.

05:04.242 --> 05:05.710
- Whiskey.
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.777 --> 05:08.647
- (laughing)
- Lots... lot's of whiskey.

05:10.982 --> 05:13.052
(Emme) I didn't disappear.

05:13.117 --> 05:14.686
I wanted to play piano.

05:14.753 --> 05:18.224
There's no piano at the
school so I went to find one.

05:18.290 --> 05:20.159
I'm sorry.

05:22.561 --> 05:26.032
Emme, there's something I...

05:26.097 --> 05:27.432
I need to tell you.

05:30.968 --> 05:32.370
(sighs)

05:34.239 --> 05:36.775
I think of you like my own daughter.

05:36.842 --> 05:38.411
Something's happened.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.753
Abby's gone.

05:47.818 --> 05:49.188
I know that already.

05:51.323 --> 05:53.726
No.

05:53.792 --> 05:57.196
No, I mean, she's... dead.

05:57.261 --> 05:59.398
She's dead.

05:59.463 --> 06:01.367
We found her body last night.

06:03.535 --> 06:05.804
You're wrong, that isn't her.

06:09.141 --> 06:11.744
- Emme...
- You made a mistake.

06:11.809 --> 06:12.644
(sighs)

06:12.710 --> 06:15.081
Abby isn't dead, I know she isn't.

06:15.146 --> 06:17.048
I was with her yesterday.

06:19.751 --> 06:21.087
What?

06:23.020 --> 06:25.758
What? Where?

06:25.823 --> 06:29.561
We met at a coffee shop in DC.

06:29.628 --> 06:30.930
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.568
You just told me you went to play piano.

06:35.633 --> 06:36.434
I know, I lied.

06:36.501 --> 06:39.405
But only because I was with Abby.

06:40.939 --> 06:43.109
She can't be dead, why
are you saying that?

06:43.174 --> 06:44.910
How did, how, how... what?

06:44.975 --> 06:46.144
How did you find her?

06:46.210 --> 06:47.446
Did she contact you?

06:47.511 --> 06:49.948
She sent me a playlist on Spotify.

06:50.015 --> 06:51.517
What? Why?

06:51.583 --> 06:53.052
Cool piano stuff.

06:55.020 --> 06:58.757
Did she tell you where she was staying?

06:58.823 --> 07:00.126
Or why she left?

07:00.191 --> 07:02.660
No.

07:02.727 --> 07:06.165
Just that she loved me, that...

07:06.230 --> 07:08.233
That she's safe, Flynn.

07:08.299 --> 07:10.602
I don't need to worry about her anymore.

07:10.669 --> 07:13.706
I want you to email her back.

07:13.771 --> 07:16.774
Tell her it's an emergency.

07:16.840 --> 07:17.876
And that I wanna see her.

07:17.943 --> 07:19.879
I can't do that.

07:19.944 --> 07:21.112
I promised her I wouldn't tell you.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.982
Emme, listen to me.

07:23.047 --> 07:24.782
This is very important.

07:26.018 --> 07:28.387
If you're telling me the truth

07:28.453 --> 07:31.251
and Abby's out there,
I need to find her now.

Both McCarthy and the dying mother

14:08.220 --> 14:10.288
Could be coincidence.

14:10.388 --> 14:11.657
Or collusion.

14:11.757 --> 14:15.294
(text alert vibrating)

14:15.393 --> 14:16.327
Text from Carroll.

14:16.427 --> 14:17.361
"Suspect on the move,

14:17.461 --> 14:18.629
west on D Street Northwest."

14:18.730 --> 14:19.965
And a license plate number.

14:20.065 --> 14:21.667
You and Regan take a team.

14:21.767 --> 14:25.337
Use caution, we don't know
if Seraphin is Hunter or human.

14:25.436 --> 14:26.837
Either way, we need him alive.

14:26.937 --> 14:28.005
Go.

14:28.105 --> 14:29.374
Yeah, I got that.

14:47.491 --> 14:49.260
(tires screeching)

14:56.933 --> 14:58.235
Don't move!

14:58.335 --> 14:59.295
(Briggs) Federal agents!

14:59.336 --> 15:01.639
Weapon down, hands on the wheel!

15:01.739 --> 15:03.174
(Richard) Take your hands off me!

15:04.941 --> 15:06.778
- Regan?
- (grunts)

15:06.878 --> 15:07.713
Regan?

15:07.812 --> 15:09.480
(grunting, gasps)

15:09.581 --> 15:11.649
I'm fine.

15:11.749 --> 15:13.118
(gasps)

15:35.639 --> 15:37.208
(gun clicking)

15:37.308 --> 15:38.342
You killed my wife.

15:38.442 --> 15:41.212
No, I am your wife.

16:00.442 --> 16:02.043
Don't be a hero.

16:02.143 --> 16:04.013
I have your gun.

16:04.113 --> 16:06.015
And this.

16:06.114 --> 16:07.549
Who knows you're here?

16:12.687 --> 16:13.955
You killed her.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.626
And then made yourself look like her.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.861
- Flynn...
- I know what you are.

16:19.961 --> 16:21.596
I've seen one.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.400
I know what's inside you.

16:24.499 --> 16:25.368
No, you don't.

16:25.468 --> 16:26.402
Six years of marriage,

16:26.502 --> 16:29.171
you don't know anything about me.

16:29.271 --> 16:30.940
(message alert beep)

16:31.040 --> 16:33.509
You told the ETU you found me?

16:33.609 --> 16:34.944
Of course I did.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.312
They'll be here any second.

16:37.412 --> 16:39.715
And they'll bust you like
we busted McCarthy.

16:39.815 --> 16:41.017
Who's McCarthy?

16:41.117 --> 16:42.184
You can stop now.

16:42.283 --> 16:45.687
I already know what a
lying sack of shit you are.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.423
Don't fu... talk to me like that.

16:48.523 --> 16:49.991
Or what?

16:51.726 --> 16:52.894
You'll cry?

16:52.994 --> 16:54.830
Fake some other bullshit?

16:54.930 --> 16:56.465
You're not my Abby.

16:56.565 --> 16:57.999
I'm as real as she was.

You can't leave now.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.086
The O's just tied the game.

18:57.186 --> 18:58.587
(Abby) The night we met at the bar?

18:58.686 --> 19:02.056
That was me.

19:02.157 --> 19:03.893
You can't leave now.

19:03.993 --> 19:05.494
The O's just tied the game.

19:13.201 --> 19:14.703
(shoes clattering)

<i>(phone ringing)</i>

19:22.378 --> 19:24.780
<i>You have reached the
voice mail of Richard Seraphin.</i>

19:26.580 --> 19:27.715
(groans)

19:27.815 --> 19:29.551
What happened out there?

19:29.651 --> 19:32.388
Driver got lucky, got a shot off.

19:32.487 --> 19:34.122
A human driver?

19:34.223 --> 19:35.590
They were all human.

19:40.661 --> 19:43.231
What did you do?

19:43.331 --> 19:45.200
We'll talk about this later.

19:54.242 --> 19:56.145
(door beeps)

19:59.380 --> 20:01.349
(door closes, beeps)

20:01.449 --> 20:03.551
We need to proceed with caution.

20:03.651 --> 20:05.720
He has friends in very high places.

20:05.821 --> 20:08.389
And a suitcase full of drug money.

20:08.490 --> 20:10.492
A dangerous combination.

20:14.128 --> 20:15.363
(door beeping)

20:16.697 --> 20:20.668
Mr. Seraphin, my name is Agent Jackson.

20:20.769 --> 20:21.871
Jackson?

20:21.971 --> 20:25.007
I thought all Jacksons
were singers or ball players.

20:25.107 --> 20:27.142
You were recently in Colombia?

20:27.242 --> 20:28.310
If Homeland Security

20:28.409 --> 20:31.546
<i>or whoever you are
needs to speak with me,</i>

20:31.647 --> 20:33.743
<i>you should've made an appointment
with my office.</i>

20:33.859 --> 20:35.939
We're not in the business
of scheduling appointments.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.186
My attorney may beg to differ.

20:38.286 --> 20:39.888
I'll, uh, need to speak with him now.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.656
That won't be necessary.

20:41.756 --> 20:43.792
(case clatters)

20:43.891 --> 20:45.727
You were with a woman today.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.230
I am often with woman.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.598
She gave you this suitcase.

20:49.697 --> 20:50.899
Are you aware of its contents?

20:54.301 --> 20:55.870
Who is she?

20:57.638 --> 20:58.674
Her name's Erika.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.842
A girlfriend of mine, one of several.

21:00.943 --> 21:03.913
She and that bag of money
are none of your damn business.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.982
Oh, it is if you're
laundering money for terrorists.

21:07.081 --> 21:09.184
Ooh, there it is.

21:10.351 --> 21:13.522
You have no jurisdiction over me.

21:13.621 --> 21:14.523
If you want to query it out,

21:14.622 --> 21:16.222
you can take it up with the White House.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.726
We're gonna need
access to whatever accounts

21:18.827 --> 21:21.263
this money was intended for.

21:21.362 --> 21:23.765
All of my accounts are sealed.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.335
Diplomatic privileges along
with my communications.

21:26.435 --> 21:28.537
I have suffered a criminal assault

21:28.637 --> 21:30.371
at the hands of your goons.

21:30.472 --> 21:32.273
By the time your
request to access my accounts

21:32.374 --> 21:33.876
has been denied, I'll have you

21:33.975 --> 21:36.844
and everyone in this
building in handcuffs.

21:36.945 --> 21:38.547
(snickering)

21:38.647 --> 21:40.215
ETU headquarters, where is it?

21:40.314 --> 21:42.150
Why? You gonna bust in there

21:42.251 --> 21:43.185
and get your dirty money back?

21:43.284 --> 21:44.352
I'll do what I have to.

21:44.453 --> 21:45.854
Where the hell is it?

21:45.954 --> 21:48.557
Put your gun down, I'll take you.

21:48.657 --> 21:51.526
So you can lead me into a trap?

21:51.627 --> 21:52.695
I don't need a trap.

21:52.794 --> 21:55.596
ETU has your lover boy in custody.

21:55.696 --> 21:58.833
They'll trace the call you
just made back to this room.

21:58.934 --> 22:01.837
It'll take 30 or 40 seconds.

22:05.205 --> 22:08.409
(grunting throughout)

22:09.610 --> 22:11.347
(glass breaking)

22:16.251 --> 22:17.786
(screaming)

22:17.886 --> 22:19.687
(glass shattering)

22:22.689 --> 22:25.093
(gun fires, Abby screaming)

22:34.234 --> 22:37.039
You want more?!

22:37.138 --> 22:39.207
Start talking!

22:43.044 --> 22:44.178
(keys rattling)

22:46.849 --> 22:49.051
(door unlocking, opening)

22:49.150 --> 22:50.818
(Flynn) Hey, babe.

22:54.022 --> 22:55.590
I got some Thai food.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.330
Got you that yellow curry you like.

23:02.430 --> 23:04.032
(keys rattle)

23:05.265 --> 23:06.734
(gun clatters)

23:16.276 --> 23:18.713
"Home is where the Harley is."

23:25.520 --> 23:27.022
(heavy sigh)

23:28.689 --> 23:31.192
(Flynn) Hey.

23:31.292 --> 23:33.161
Wow, hot stuff.

23:33.262 --> 23:34.096
(sighing)

23:34.196 --> 23:36.098
What happened to my bag?

23:36.197 --> 23:38.599
Guess I was more
stressed than I thought.

23:38.699 --> 23:40.068
Sorry.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.437
No, it's these guns.

23:42.538 --> 23:44.073
You don't even know your own strength.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.208
I'll pay for a new one, I promise.

23:46.308 --> 23:48.042
It's just a stupid bag.

23:48.142 --> 23:51.279
- Yeah.
- I don't care about any of this stuff.

23:51.379 --> 23:52.547
Well, except for her.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.148
(laughs)

23:54.249 --> 23:56.919
Now I just care about being with you.

23:58.953 --> 24:00.856
You happy to be here, aren't you?

24:00.955 --> 24:02.757
Of course I am.

24:04.725 --> 24:06.661
It's just...

24:06.762 --> 24:08.530
It's hard...

24:08.629 --> 24:11.433
being away from my old life.

24:11.532 --> 24:14.102
The people back home,
everything I ever knew.

24:16.670 --> 24:20.341
Sometimes I don't know who I am anymore.

24:25.513 --> 24:27.014
Come here.

24:31.418 --> 24:33.088
You're the girl who saved my life.

24:34.289 --> 24:35.891
Thank you.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.065
All right, come on.

24:43.165 --> 24:44.299
Give me your best shot.

24:44.398 --> 24:46.667
Let her rip, tiger, come on!

24:46.767 --> 24:48.636
Ooh.

24:48.736 --> 24:50.605
That's the best you can do?

24:50.705 --> 24:52.507
You have no idea.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.076
Oh, yeah?

24:54.176 --> 24:55.377
Come on.

24:57.244 --> 24:58.513
Prove it.

25:00.915 --> 25:03.284
The day you moved in.

25:06.154 --> 25:07.723
The cake.

25:07.822 --> 25:09.690
What did it say?

25:09.791 --> 25:11.326
"Home is where the Harley is."

25:13.828 --> 25:15.164
And it was German chocolate.

25:15.263 --> 25:18.567
I baked it for you myself.

25:18.667 --> 25:19.967
No.

25:20.068 --> 25:22.771
How do I know you didn't transfer
Abby's memories to you

25:22.870 --> 25:24.773
with some alien mind thing, huh?

25:24.872 --> 25:27.208
We can't do that, it's impossible.

25:27.309 --> 25:31.180
So, you can switch bodies and
build spaceships but not that.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.416
I was there, Flynn.

25:34.515 --> 25:35.449
I swear.

25:35.550 --> 25:36.885
It was all me.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.503
Hold out your arm.

25:55.603 --> 25:57.071
Hold out your arm.

25:59.006 --> 26:01.243
Don't make me shoot you.

26:10.251 --> 26:12.354
(Flynn grunting)

26:18.426 --> 26:19.927
(wavering) Towel, please?

26:33.741 --> 26:36.945
(both panting)

26:50.425 --> 26:51.460
(kissing)

26:56.230 --> 26:58.800
You can touch it.

26:58.899 --> 26:59.935
(snickers)

27:02.602 --> 27:03.938
Three months since we met.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.907
How come you never asked me about it?

27:07.041 --> 27:09.176
Figured you'd tell
me when you were ready.

27:10.878 --> 27:14.416
Most people, it's usually the first
thing out of their mouths.

27:14.515 --> 27:16.017
I'm not most people.

27:16.118 --> 27:18.352
No.

27:18.453 --> 27:20.289
You're definitely not.

27:29.163 --> 27:32.467
Afghanistan.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.237
My unit was guarding a supply convoy

27:35.337 --> 27:39.541
when we got hit high on both sides.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.977
They forced us into the rocks.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.446
Bastards were fast.

27:45.546 --> 27:48.115
Knew the canyon like the
back of their hands

27:48.215 --> 27:51.986
'cause we couldn't hit any of them.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.689
Then they got us.

27:53.789 --> 27:56.892
(taking deep breath)

27:58.760 --> 28:01.163
They put us in this pit.

28:01.263 --> 28:05.634
Then they pulled us out

28:05.734 --> 28:07.636
one-by-one.

28:08.869 --> 28:11.907
I was the last.

28:12.006 --> 28:14.275
They yanked me out.

28:14.376 --> 28:15.844
Held me down.

28:19.347 --> 28:22.117
Next thing I remember

28:22.216 --> 28:24.218
I was getting picked
up on the side of the road

28:24.319 --> 28:26.620
by some skinny private from Tucson

28:26.721 --> 28:30.224
telling me how lucky I was.

28:30.324 --> 28:32.827
I'm so sorry, that's awful.

28:32.927 --> 28:35.296
Ten guys in my unit,

28:35.397 --> 28:37.765
and only two of us made it out alive.

28:43.036 --> 28:46.273
It doesn't make any fu... sense.

28:46.374 --> 28:48.410
You're a survivor, Flynn.

28:56.250 --> 28:59.521
I only keep on going because of you.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.089
Me too.

29:01.188 --> 29:02.757
You're all I've got.

29:11.698 --> 29:14.769
(kissing)

29:20.942 --> 29:23.612
(heavy breathing)

29:23.712 --> 29:25.080
I love you.

29:31.752 --> 29:33.821
You shouldn't have come looking for me.

29:47.267 --> 29:48.936
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

29:49.036 --> 29:50.604
Think how you would've reacted.

29:53.241 --> 29:55.911
Other Hunters did.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.479
Randall Slavich.

29:57.579 --> 29:59.748
And look what happened to his wife.

29:59.848 --> 30:01.515
I was trying to protect you.

30:01.616 --> 30:03.652
I don't need
protection, I need the truth.

30:07.388 --> 30:08.756
Why did you pick me?

30:08.857 --> 30:10.024
You're an FBI agent.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.485
- There's thousands of agents.
- You were working narcotics.

30:12.561 --> 30:15.597
So is everyone else in my unit.

30:15.696 --> 30:17.032
Reyes...

30:20.033 --> 30:22.903
Kevin.

30:23.003 --> 30:24.473
What did you do to him?

30:24.572 --> 30:25.840
Nothing.

30:28.275 --> 30:30.411
So help me.

30:30.512 --> 30:33.715
I will splatter your gray guts

30:33.814 --> 30:37.218
against that couch and not think twice.

30:37.319 --> 30:38.320
Did you kill my partner?

30:38.419 --> 30:39.321
No.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.955
- Did you kill him?
- No!

30:46.359 --> 30:49.697
But I was stealing information
from him on drug investigations.

30:51.299 --> 30:52.634
You and him.

30:52.734 --> 30:56.437
Funneling it to McCarthy.

30:56.538 --> 30:58.373
To build the Hunter drug trade.

30:58.473 --> 31:00.008
Kevin started suspecting.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.811
He started calling me.

31:02.910 --> 31:05.479
Asking questions.

31:05.580 --> 31:08.649
McCarthy killed him to shut him up.

31:08.750 --> 31:12.020
I'm sorry, Flynn.

31:12.119 --> 31:14.321
I'm so sorry.

31:23.531 --> 31:26.967
After we took Emme in,

31:27.068 --> 31:28.904
I fell in love with her, too.

31:33.808 --> 31:37.612
That's why I had to see her yesterday.

31:37.712 --> 31:40.163
If you loved her so much...

31:42.151 --> 31:43.484
then why did you leave?

31:43.584 --> 31:46.053
They wanted me out, said
I'd "gone native."

31:46.154 --> 31:48.690
- McCarthy?
- Everyone.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.792
But I refused to come in.

31:50.891 --> 31:52.994
I had a family, you and Emme.

31:53.093 --> 31:54.895
I couldn't imagine living without you

31:54.995 --> 31:58.465
even if it meant being someone
I never really was.

31:58.565 --> 32:00.134
I wanted you more.

32:04.738 --> 32:06.206
I still do.

32:10.610 --> 32:15.182
(clicking)

32:15.282 --> 32:17.484
They're here.

32:17.584 --> 32:18.886
They're coming for us.

32:21.355 --> 32:23.592
(clicking)

32:26.866 --> 32:29.002
(grunts, clicking)

32:32.272 --> 32:34.474
I can hear the Feelers.

32:34.573 --> 32:35.542
Feelers are Hunters?

32:35.641 --> 32:37.143
They're Brother
servants, his eyes and ears.

32:37.244 --> 32:38.411
They can sense other Hunters.

32:38.512 --> 32:41.315
- Through the walls?
- Walls don't stop our language.

32:41.415 --> 32:44.184
That won't stop them either.

32:44.283 --> 32:45.686
Give me my gun.

32:45.785 --> 32:49.155
Fine, you can do it, shoot me.

32:49.255 --> 32:50.290
Right here.

32:50.389 --> 32:52.124
It'll be painful but I'll survive.

32:52.224 --> 32:53.292
They need to think that
I put up a fight,

32:53.392 --> 32:54.827
and that's how you escaped.

32:54.927 --> 32:55.963
Do it and go.

32:56.062 --> 32:58.098
I could kill you.

32:58.197 --> 32:59.999
You won't.

33:00.099 --> 33:02.168
Do it.

33:02.269 --> 33:04.338
(clicking)

33:09.742 --> 33:10.911
Do it.

33:17.282 --> 33:19.485
Why?

33:19.586 --> 33:21.154
Why did the Hunters target me?

33:21.253 --> 33:23.055
And don't give me that FBI bullshit.

33:23.156 --> 33:24.457
Why?

33:24.558 --> 33:27.694
Because you lived when
you should've died.

33:27.793 --> 33:28.628
Do it.

33:28.728 --> 33:30.630
(clicking)

33:36.269 --> 33:37.971
Shoot me, do it.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.811
I lied about Kevin.

33:44.910 --> 33:46.312
I'm the one who killed him.

33:50.782 --> 33:52.386
You said it was McCarthy.

33:55.754 --> 33:58.224
Your friend, your partner.

33:58.324 --> 33:59.359
He begged for his life,

33:59.458 --> 34:02.461
and I shot him in the face.

34:02.561 --> 34:04.430
It was lies, all of it.

34:04.531 --> 34:08.400
Your hands on me, having you inside me.

34:08.501 --> 34:10.436
I hated every second.

34:10.536 --> 34:12.371
I never loved you.

34:12.472 --> 34:14.107
I used you.

34:14.206 --> 34:15.509
(whispers) Do it.

34:16.908 --> 34:18.177
Do it.

34:19.812 --> 34:22.449
- Do it!
- (gunshot)

34:22.547 --> 34:25.284
(clicking)

34:34.159 --> 34:36.530
(clicking)

34:36.629 --> 34:37.929
(high pitched clicks)

34:41.934 --> 34:44.804
(Abby sobbing)

34:49.876 --> 34:54.112
Our NSA contacts won't
touch Seraphin because he's IMF.

34:54.213 --> 34:55.447
Now what?

34:55.547 --> 34:56.550
Do we contain him?

34:56.649 --> 34:58.785
No, no, we need to get
it out of him directly,

34:58.885 --> 35:00.954
bank accounts,
passwords, whatever we can.

35:01.053 --> 35:03.222
If he's laundering
money for the Hunters...

35:03.323 --> 35:05.525
Then he's in contact
with their leadership.

35:05.624 --> 35:07.159
- Brother Number Four.
- Mm.

35:07.260 --> 35:11.932
The woman he was with
might be a... go-between.

35:12.032 --> 35:14.667
And given Flynn's call this morning,

35:14.767 --> 35:16.470
I have an idea who that might be.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.475
(door beeps)

35:23.709 --> 35:26.245
We've found a paper trail

35:26.345 --> 35:27.113
(door closes)

35:27.213 --> 35:29.381
linking your Colombian connection

35:29.481 --> 35:33.887
to a terrorist organization.

35:33.986 --> 35:35.722
Oh, here's me thinking this coffee

35:35.821 --> 35:37.524
was the start of my apology.

35:42.995 --> 35:44.931
Is this Erika?

35:48.633 --> 35:52.938
Have you ever noticed
anything unusual on her skin?

35:53.039 --> 35:54.508
Like this, perhaps?

35:58.910 --> 36:00.479
I don't know what that is.

36:00.579 --> 36:02.715
Well, that's a skin condition that, uh,

36:02.816 --> 36:05.952
members of their species get.

36:06.051 --> 36:07.287
Species?

36:24.202 --> 36:25.738
These are, are fake.

36:25.838 --> 36:27.541
This, this is absurd.

36:30.776 --> 36:34.314
See, I don't know what kind
of game you're play...

36:34.414 --> 36:37.249
(Jackson, distorted) This is what
you've been sleeping with.

36:37.350 --> 36:39.219
And these things

36:39.318 --> 36:42.988
that you've been
laundering money for, they're...

36:54.133 --> 36:55.401
(sighs)

36:58.370 --> 36:59.673
(Richard) What did you do to me?

36:59.772 --> 37:03.843
Richard... Can I call you Richard?

37:03.943 --> 37:05.644
You gave me something in my coffee.

37:05.745 --> 37:08.715
I need access to all of your records.

37:08.814 --> 37:11.017
Bank accounts, your emails.

37:11.117 --> 37:14.486
I need all your passwords.

37:14.586 --> 37:16.522
And I need them now.

37:16.622 --> 37:19.725
Here, take these.

37:19.825 --> 37:21.528
Now, there you go.

37:24.339 --> 37:26.543
<i>And in a bizarre turn of events,</i>

37:26.660 --> 37:29.235
<i>Richard Seraphin, the
Director for Global Asset Management</i>

37:29.374 --> 37:31.793
<i>for the International
Monetary Fund who was reported</i>

37:31.940 --> 37:34.896
<i>missing yesterday is
currently undergoing medical assessment.</i>

37:35.045 --> 37:37.522
<i>Seraphin was picked up
by DC police this morning</i>

37:37.588 --> 37:39.791
<i>claiming he'd been taken
prisoner by a secret government</i>

37:39.858 --> 37:43.396
<i>organization and had been
sleeping with an alien sex spy.</i>

37:43.462 --> 37:45.398
Scopolamine in his coffee?

37:45.463 --> 37:47.766
Elicits hallucinations and confessions.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.568
Straight from the company playbook.

37:49.634 --> 37:51.570
<i>Hidden history of mental illness.</i>

37:51.636 --> 37:53.739
Ellsberg was before your time.

37:53.804 --> 37:55.808
Nixon's finest hour.

37:55.873 --> 37:58.043
I know my U.S. history.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.312
(Jackson) Carroll and Abby?

37:59.378 --> 38:01.814
She's gone again with the wind.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.715
You let her escape?

38:03.782 --> 38:04.884
I don't know.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.351
There was blood in the hotel room.

38:06.418 --> 38:08.054
- Hunter blood?
- Mm.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.554
Gone before local PD got there?

38:09.621 --> 38:13.224
Spick-and-span, won't be your Watergate.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.127
I'll start sorting through the
Seraphin intel with Jules.

38:15.192 --> 38:16.428
Mm.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.799
A sum of money that large

38:19.864 --> 38:21.900
can only be controlled from the top.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.069
Brother Number Four.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.203
Find me the link.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.709
How's her arm?

38:30.775 --> 38:32.143
It'll be fine.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.212
Must've been quite a hit.

38:33.277 --> 38:34.980
I bounce back.

38:42.054 --> 38:43.622
You gave yourself the treatment.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.391
The urges haven't stopped.

38:45.456 --> 38:47.992
I understand that, but the treatment
makes you vulnerable.

38:48.058 --> 38:48.960
I don't care.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.547
Well, you should, this unit needs you.

38:50.561 --> 38:52.531
To be a weapon.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.466
Do you really believe
that's the only reason you're here?

38:54.532 --> 38:56.502
I'm not like the other Hunters,
I'm not an animal.

38:56.567 --> 38:58.169
Of course you're not.

38:58.235 --> 39:00.239
And I'm not your pet either.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.974
Or your toy solder or your experiment.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.944
I care about your
safety, your well-being,

39:05.009 --> 39:08.446
and I've always tried to
treat you as if you were one of my...

39:08.512 --> 39:11.317
One of my own.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.285
You're an Elder at your temple.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.922
You and your family
attend service every Sunday.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.657
Your faith and your family

39:19.724 --> 39:24.563
are the most
important things in your life.

39:24.628 --> 39:27.366
But you've never once asked
me to come with you

39:27.431 --> 39:30.869
because I'm not human.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.671
My soul isn't worth saving.

39:32.737 --> 39:35.273
That is, if you really think I have one.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.545
Allison, I'm sorry, I didn't
even know you were interested.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.848
Don't worry about it.

39:42.913 --> 39:45.984
You've got your faith to soothe you.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.886
I've got a machine.

39:56.661 --> 39:58.263
You didn't call back.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.197
(grunts)

39:59.264 --> 40:01.500
I couldn't, not right away.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.106
Did you see her?

40:07.172 --> 40:08.940
(sighing)

40:09.007 --> 40:10.675
No.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.944
She never showed up, Emme, I'm sorry.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.346
I didn't lie.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.683
I know.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.886
I believe you, but that
wasn't the Abby we knew.

40:20.951 --> 40:22.487
But it was.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.490
It wasn't.

40:24.556 --> 40:28.761
She's gone, Emme.

40:28.826 --> 40:30.295
We have to let her go.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.701
Both of us.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.435
I don't believe it.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.941
That's normal.

40:43.007 --> 40:46.478
That's the first stage of grief.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.247
And then what?

40:48.313 --> 40:50.316
Then it's anger.

40:51.583 --> 40:55.020
Or... or bargaining.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.491
I don't remember.

40:58.556 --> 41:02.293
There are seven stages...

41:02.360 --> 41:04.730
- I better look it up.
- Yeah.

41:04.795 --> 41:08.030
I need to get this right for her.

41:08.967 --> 41:09.835
I found it.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.538
Kübler-Ross stages of grief.

41:12.603 --> 41:14.439
Will you memorize these with me?

41:16.375 --> 41:20.079
There aren't seven stages, there's five.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.748
Number one.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.683
Denial.

41:24.748 --> 41:26.718
Number two: anger.

41:26.784 --> 41:30.855
Number three... bargaining.

41:30.922 --> 41:34.927
Number four: depression.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.462
Number five...

41:40.232 --> 41:41.800
Acceptance.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.476
(clicking)

41:53.744 --> 41:56.882
My Feelers, you have returned
to your Brother.

41:56.947 --> 41:59.484
(clicking)

42:01.119 --> 42:03.122
You found her.

42:03.188 --> 42:04.690
Show me.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.439
(clicking and indistinct whispering)

42:31.650 --> 42:34.353
(choking, coughing)
