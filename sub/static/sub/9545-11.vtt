He'll be here.

<i>Mr. Monk, do you think</i>
<i>he really has information about Trudy?</i>
Mm-hmm.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.830
What if he's lying
just to get the reward money?

00:41.908 --> 00:45.344
What if he's not?
What if he's the real thing?

00:46.746 --> 00:49.874
Do you have the cash?
I just don't want you
getting your hopes up.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.645
Natalie, I don't have
an abundance of hope.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.882
Let me enjoy the little I have.
Please, give it to me.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.650
Okay.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.888
Okay. You wait over there
by the... facility thing.

01:01.961 --> 01:05.727
You mean the bathroom?
I believe they're called
facility things.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.632
I'm not leaving you.
Natalie, he said to come alone.

01:08.701 --> 01:13.570
If he sees you here, he won't stop.
Mr. Monk, my job is to help you,
not to wait for you in the facility thing.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.098
This is about Trudy.
I have got to do this.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.509
Please.
All right.

01:19.579 --> 01:23.345
But just promise me
you won't pay him unless you're sure.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.850

You said you had a picture.

02:04.891 --> 02:07.883
You've been lookin'
for a six-fingered man?
Yeah.

02:17.036 --> 02:19.004
Where did you get this?

02:19.072 --> 02:23.133
Took it myself.
I met him in Vancouver, Canada.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.872
He was drunk. He was talking about
killing your wife with a car bomb.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.471
What's his name?

02:29.549 --> 02:33.713
The picture's free, Mr. Monk.
The name's gonna cost you.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.754
Wait, wait, wait, wait-
Wait a minute.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.020
- This sixth finger-
- Yeah, what about it?

02:41.094 --> 02:45.030
There's no hair on the knuckle.
This photograph has been doctored.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.499

You can't help me at all, can you?
Give me the-

a Greyhound bus to you?

05:37.103 --> 05:40.038
No. Buses have windows and seats.

all his money from the bank.

Maybe this guy really did have a clue
about Trudy's murder,
and Monk solved the case.

11:57.583 --> 12:01.747
I mean, he found the guy who killed Trudy
and killed him.

12:01.821 --> 12:05.313

changed his name and started a new life.

It was in Naples, Italy.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.817
Jerry Little.
Jerry.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.547
Short forJeremiah,
which is my favorite name.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.954
That's certainly a coincidence.
Isn't it?

16:00.359 --> 16:04.125
Oh-Are these clothes new?
I bought 'em yesterday.

16:04.196 --> 16:07.029
They look good.
Ooh, that is a good look on you.

16:07.099 --> 16:11.229
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Well, where-where-where-
where are my clothes?

16:11.303 --> 16:15.399
<i>You lost 'em.</i>
<i>You lost everything gambling.</i>

16:15.474 --> 16:19.171
<i>I gamble?</i>
Mm-hmm. Darling,
you have a serious addiction.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.735
Can't stop yourself.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.409
Bet all your luggage
and bet everything you own on red.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.716
I was in the casino.
I was watchin' ya.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.551
That's where we met.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.488
Now what?
The milk, um-

16:33.559 --> 16:37.222
I feel- I feel frightened.

16:37.296 --> 16:40.094
You're afraid of milk?
How is that possible?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.360
What-What is wrong with me?

16:42.434 --> 16:44.868
It probably happened
when you banged your head.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.429
Just give it a few days.
You'll be okay.
Maybe I should see a doctor.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.908
Oh, you saw a doctor.
Don't you remember?
Oh, right.

16:51.977 --> 16:57.244
He told you to trust me
and... to do everything that I say.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.716
Yes, dear.

17:02.755 --> 17:07.419
Oh, oh. Um,
I'm gonna need some money.
I owe that waitress seven dollars.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.018
What do you care?
I just wanna do the right thing.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.893
Maybe later. Right now,
you got some chores to do.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.728
You love doing chores.
Oh.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.200
Here's your list.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.307
Fix-Fix the roof? No.
Mm-hmm.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.310
No, l-I can't.
Sure you can.
You're a roofer.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.779
I'm a roofer?
That's your job.

17:29.848 --> 17:34.148
I'll tell you what, tiger.
You fix the roof, and then later on tonight-
[Sputters]

17:34.219 --> 17:36.653
I'll show you how much
I appreciate it.

17:50.702 --> 17:53.967
[Panting]
Here's your toolbox.

17:54.039 --> 17:56.030
Up you go.

18:22.534 --> 18:26.095
Now what?
Uh, I'm-I'm afraid.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.162
You're up two feet, Jerry.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.937
You can do this.
That's why you became a roofer-
to get over your fear of heights.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.638
And it worked.
You're world-famous.

18:34.713 --> 18:38.205
Jerry, you're the king of all the roofers.
Now, up you go.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.217
Yes, dear.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.654
Oh! Ooh!

18:46.258 --> 18:48.783
I'm a roofer?

19:14.953 --> 19:17.683
What the hell?

19:20.259 --> 19:23.660
<i>[Yells]</i>
<i>Help.!</i>

19:26.832 --> 19:29.824
Help!
Somebody get 'em off me!

19:36.542 --> 19:38.669
You recognize him?
No.

19:38.744 --> 19:42.009
His name is Teddy Mulligan.
You were right about Monk's money.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.641
The serial numbers led us right to him.
He's confessed to everything.

19:45.717 --> 19:48.914
He tried to con Monk
out of the reward money.
Then where's Mr. Monk?

19:48.987 --> 19:51.421
Mulligan says there was a fight.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.856
Oh, my God.
And Mulligan hit him on the head.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.521
Oh, my God.
And then he threw him on the back
of a truck, and the truck drove away.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.587
That's all he knows.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.936
Is he- Is he dead?

20:05.003 --> 20:09.099
I don't think so.
There's been no report of a body.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.101
Hey, he's out there.

20:14.179 --> 20:18.115
If somebody's seen him, we'll find him.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.708
I promise.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.947
<i>[Bell Jingles]</i>

20:28.093 --> 20:30.084
<i>Hey, welcome back.</i>
Good afternoon.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.154
Hey.
Are you two, uh, together?

20:33.232 --> 20:37.191
Yeah, we're married. We're married.
This is my husband Jerry.

20:37.269 --> 20:42.571
Uh, my name is Jerry, and we're married.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.802
Um-
No kidding?

20:44.876 --> 20:48.403
Well, congratulations.
Thank you, Gail.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.643
Yeah, just like in the movies.
We met on that cruise I took.

20:51.717 --> 20:54.083
Saw each other in the casino,
and boom.

20:54.152 --> 20:58.145
[Imitates Explosion]
We knew, didn't we? We knew.
Love at first sight.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.715
That's how it happened,
evidently.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.193
Is Debbie here?
Uh, I owe her some money.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.823
No, uh, she quit this morning.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.264
She quit?
Just like that.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.302
Found this note on the door.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.498
Said that her boyfriend's
moving to Denver,
and she's going with him...

21:14.573 --> 21:16.598
<i>and she doesn't know</i>
<i>when she'll be back.</i>

21:16.675 --> 21:18.666
I was her best friend.
She didn't say a word to me.

21:18.744 --> 21:23.181
There's something wrong with this.
Look-

21:23.248 --> 21:27.810
Look at that smudge.
This note was written
by a left-handed person.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.820
But Debbie is right-handed.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.981
That's right. She is.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.026
I don't think Debbie wrote this note.
Where does she live?

21:35.093 --> 21:37.288
<i>Right next door.</i>

21:37.362 --> 21:40.490
- I have the key.
- What do you care about this girl?

21:40.565 --> 21:43.830
I just wanna check it out, dear.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.996
Well, make it fast,
'cause... gotta get home.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.267
We got chores to do
and lovin' to make and-

21:49.341 --> 21:51.332
[Cash Register Dings]

22:09.728 --> 22:12.993
What if she comes back and finds us?
You ever think about that?

22:17.669 --> 22:19.637
[Chirps]

22:23.108 --> 22:26.305
What are you doin'?

22:26.378 --> 22:28.903
I think... I'm thinking.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.448
- That's the way you think?
- [Chirps]

22:31.516 --> 22:35.418
<i>If you wanna look around,</i>
<i>look around like a normal person.</i>
<i>You're embarrassin'me.</i>

22:35.487 --> 22:37.421
<i>I gotta live in this town.</i>

22:37.489 --> 22:40.151
I'm sorry, dear.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.955
But something is wrong here.

22:43.028 --> 22:47.089
It looks like she's had this bird
her whole life.

22:47.165 --> 22:49.565
She wouldn't just leave it behind,
would she?

22:49.634 --> 22:52.125
How are you noticing this stuff?

22:52.204 --> 22:57.005
I don't know.
I'm just... seeing things.

22:57.075 --> 23:01.444
<i>Can I be honest with you?</i>
<i>I wish you would concentrate</i>
<i>like this on your roofing work.</i>

23:01.513 --> 23:03.538
Yes, my beloved.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.955
Pregnancy test.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.770
Looks like she had a bun in the oven.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.830
How do you know?
Those two little lines there,
that means positive.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.969
See, you pee on that end.
[Groans]
Wipe! Wipe, wipe! Wipe!

23:34.045 --> 23:37.606
Give me- I need a wipe.
All right. Relax.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.344
<i>Ew.</i>

23:41.887 --> 23:43.821
Broken glass.

23:43.889 --> 23:46.858
<i>Broken glass.</i>

23:52.931 --> 23:54.865
This table has been moved.

23:56.535 --> 24:00.198
I think somebody was fighting in here.
You see this tape?

24:00.272 --> 24:04.709
There was a rug right here.
It's still sticky.

24:06.077 --> 24:11.481
<i>Okay, why would she leave all of</i>
<i>her clothes behind, but take the rug?</i>

24:16.755 --> 24:18.746
Cora.

24:20.358 --> 24:23.555
L-I think this poor girl
has been murdered.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.723
[Laughing]

24:32.704 --> 24:34.797
<i>[Beeping]</i>

24:40.145 --> 24:43.672
Sheriff, are you sure it's safe?
I hate bees.

24:43.748 --> 24:47.149
Don't worry about the bees, Larry.
Ned's got 'em all rounded up.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.312
They're fast asleep, I hope.

24:49.387 --> 24:52.117
Sheriff? Sheriff, what do you think
about the waitress?

24:52.190 --> 24:54.124
Well, I think, uh-
What do I think?

24:54.192 --> 24:56.717
I think she went to Denver to, uh,
be with her boyfriend.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.093
I told you!
No, no, no.
Sheriff. Sheriff!

24:59.164 --> 25:01.394
What about the parakeet?
And the-And the missing rug?

25:01.466 --> 25:04.128
And, look. Look. Wait.
Look. What about the note?

25:04.202 --> 25:08.263
I don't think she wrote
this note herself.
See that, Sheriff?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.274
Mister- I'm sorry.
I forgot your name.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.833
So have I.
Jerry.

25:12.911 --> 25:16.608
Jerry.
<i>Jerry, it's not like it is on TV.</i>

25:16.681 --> 25:20.208
In real life, things are pretty much
the way they seem.

25:20.285 --> 25:24.051
<i>For example, this looks like</i>
<i>a drunk-driving accident.</i>

25:24.122 --> 25:26.955
Right?
Well, that's exactly what it is.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.722
He-He was drunk?
Oh, yeah, drunk as a skunk.

25:30.795 --> 25:33.889
8:00 this morning,
Roger Zisk, local hotshot,

25:33.965 --> 25:38.868
<i>plowed through that fence</i>
<i>into these bees</i>
<i>and got stung about a hundred times.</i>

25:38.937 --> 25:41.667
Idiot.
Okay, Sheriff, here's my list.

25:41.740 --> 25:46.006
He knocked over five of my honeycombs
worth $400 apiece,
plus 20 feet of my fence.

25:46.077 --> 25:49.171
Who's gonna pay for all of that?
I'm sure he's insured, Ned.

25:49.247 --> 25:53.877
He better be. That boy's a brat.
A drunken, spoiled brat.
He always has been.

25:53.952 --> 25:56.011
I'm glad he got all stung and swollen.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.783
Ned, uh, why don't you head up
to Lookout Point...

25:58.857 --> 26:01.257
and see what you can do
about those hornets' nests?

26:01.326 --> 26:04.056
<i>We got kids gettin'stung</i>
<i>up there every day.</i>

26:04.129 --> 26:07.326
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
But that punk owes me money.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.799
- The windows are up.
- So what?

26:11.870 --> 26:14.737
Why didn't he stay in the car?
He was surrounded by bees.

26:14.806 --> 26:19.243
<i>I would havejust stayed put.</i>
Yakkity-yak-yak.
What are you talkin' about?

26:19.311 --> 26:22.803
<i>He probably panicked.</i>
<i>Like I said, he was really wasted.</i>

26:22.881 --> 26:25.850
L-I don't think so.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.085
I saw him just a few minutes before 8:00.

26:30.155 --> 26:35.092
He drove right past our house.
There was a branch in the road.

26:35.160 --> 26:38.960
He swerved to avoid it.
His reflexes were perfect.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.022
- He couldn't have been drunk.
- He wasn't drunk?

26:42.100 --> 26:45.763
<i>He deliberately drove his car</i>
<i>into this bee farm?</i>

26:45.837 --> 26:48.704
- Why would anybody do that?
- I don't know.

26:48.773 --> 26:52.368
<i>And Debbie Barnett isn't in Denver.</i>
<i>She's been murdered.</i>

26:52.444 --> 26:55.208
Have you seen a doctor about that bump?

26:55.280 --> 26:58.113
It's not the bump.
It's some kind of midlife crisis.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.447
All of the sudden,
he's not happy fixing roofs.

27:00.518 --> 27:04.352
He's gotta be Captain America.
What is wrong with you?

27:22.307 --> 27:25.708
<i>Well, he got beaned</i>
<i>pretty hard on the head.</i>
Huh.

27:25.777 --> 27:28.712
We're printing up 4,000 of these.
I'm gonna have 'em put up.

27:28.780 --> 27:32.841
We're gonna post them in post offices,
truck stops and drugstores.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.317
Wait, wait.
Why the drugstores?

27:35.387 --> 27:38.015
I figure he's gonna have to buy wipes
sooner or later.

27:38.089 --> 27:43.026
You know, Captain,
the amnesia that you're describing
to me is actually quite rare.

27:43.094 --> 27:45.426
Maybe, but it's all we got.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.159
I have no body.
He hasn't contacted us.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.760
- He hasn't contacted Natalie.
- Yeah, and we've notified
every hospital in the country.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.770
There's no sign of him.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.965
Doctor, if I'm right
and Monk is out there...

27:56.041 --> 28:00.535
and he doesn't know who he is,
what can we expect?

28:00.612 --> 28:06.346
From a psychological standpoint,
we'd be in uncharted territory.

28:06.418 --> 28:10.252
Adrian would be in
a complete dissociative state.

28:10.321 --> 28:15.122
He would be like a pilot
who's flying in the fog
without any instruments.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.923
He's gotta be scared to death.

28:17.996 --> 28:22.228
But in a weird way,
if he's not seriously hurt,
this could actually help him.

28:22.300 --> 28:26.532
See, Adrian has always had
a problem detaching-
Yeah.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.538
Iooking at himself objectively.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.507
So if you're right,
he could be out there right now...

28:31.576 --> 28:34.101
meeting himself
for the very first time.

28:35.313 --> 28:37.611
- He's meeting himself?
- Mm-hmm.

28:37.682 --> 28:40.242
That can't be good.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.928
Hey, Jerry? Jerry?

28:51.996 --> 28:55.056
Hey, Jerry!

28:55.133 --> 28:57.658
Could I, uh,
talk to you a minute?

28:59.904 --> 29:04.568
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning
about Roger pretending to be drunk.

29:04.642 --> 29:06.803
Now, we found some blood in his car.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.574
It wasn't fresh.
It was from the night before.

29:09.647 --> 29:14.346
He hurt himself before the crash
someplace else.

29:14.419 --> 29:18.253
Well, could be. In the meantime,
nobody's heard from Debbie Barnett.

29:18.323 --> 29:20.188
Do you really think
there's a connection?

29:20.258 --> 29:23.785
Well, what do you think, Sheriff?

29:23.862 --> 29:27.958
Hmm. I'm gonna go over and talk to Roger,
see what he has to say.
You wanna join me?

29:28.032 --> 29:29.693
Yeah.
Okay.

29:40.445 --> 29:44.074
<i>It's the biggest feed store</i>
<i>in the county.</i>

29:44.149 --> 29:47.482
Roger's father-in-law owns it.
He lets Roger run it.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.816
[Coughing]

29:49.888 --> 29:54.222
Uh, I don't wanna tell you
what those bags smell like.

29:54.292 --> 29:59.286
Well, that's exactly what they are.
That's fertilizer.

29:59.364 --> 30:03.824
My God! My God,
this is worse than drug trafficking.

30:03.902 --> 30:05.961
You gotta nail this guy.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.900
- Sheriff.
- Roger. How you feeling?

30:09.974 --> 30:14.468
Ah, you know, I'll be all right.
People always said I had a swelled head.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.480
<i>I guess they're finally right.</i>

30:17.949 --> 30:21.043
- What's he doing here?
- You two met?

30:21.119 --> 30:25.021
- Yeah, you could say that.
- Well, this is Jerry, Cora's new husband.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.023
He's been helping me out today.

30:27.091 --> 30:29.218
Yeah, well, listen.

30:29.294 --> 30:33.230
I know I did some damage out there,
but tell Ned I'm gonna take care of it.

30:33.298 --> 30:37.098
You know I'm good for it.
I was out there this morning.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.535
From the tire tracks,
it looked like you stopped,

30:40.605 --> 30:44.439
then turned around, and then-
then drove into that bee farm.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.569
You mean on purpose?
Are you kiddin'?

30:47.645 --> 30:51.581
You ever been stung 140 times?
Because it's-it's no picnic.

30:51.649 --> 30:55.016
Roger, you know Debbie Barnett, right?

30:55.086 --> 30:59.284
Yeah, sure.
<i>Well, evidently, she left town</i>
<i>without telling anybody.</i>

30:59.357 --> 31:01.291
<i>I just talked to her parents.</i>

31:01.359 --> 31:05.455
They're mighty worried.
You haven't been seeing her,
have you, Roger?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.896
[Scoffs] Sheriff Bates,
you're talking to a married man.

31:07.966 --> 31:10.298
Did you know she was pregnant?
How would I know that?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.962
You like Willie Nelson, Mr. Zisk?
Yeah, he's all right.

31:13.037 --> 31:16.029
You are left-handed, isn't that right?
Carl, who is this guy?

31:16.107 --> 31:19.975
<i>Look, I got work to do.</i>
<i>Just educate this man, all right?</i>
<i>You tell him who he's talkin'to.</i>

31:23.681 --> 31:26.275
He's the guy.
Let's call the captain.

31:26.351 --> 31:30.253
What captain?
I don't know.

31:30.321 --> 31:34.223
Jerry, I like your style.

31:34.292 --> 31:38.888
As a matter of fact,
I've been looking for a deputy.

31:38.963 --> 31:41.659
A deputy?
The sheriff said I would make
a great detective.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.667
He said I was a natural.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.501
He said he would sponsor me,
help me with the application.
Well, forget that.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.301
Cora-

31:49.374 --> 31:53.333
Darling, I think he's right.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.675
Listen.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.874
<i>[Cat Screeches]</i>

31:59.250 --> 32:03.880
The truth is,
I don't like myself very much.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.856
I have all these strange habits.
I'm nervous all the time.

32:06.925 --> 32:10.793
But when I was there today
at the scene of the crime,

32:10.862 --> 32:13.023
suddenly it all made sense.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.361
Things were clicking in my head.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.266
Click, click.
I'm not livin' with a cop.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.668
<i>I hate cops.</i>
<i>You're a roofer, understand?</i>

32:20.738 --> 32:22.865
- Conversation's over.
- Yes, darling.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.966
- <i>I told you to stop dreaming.</i>
- Yes.

32:25.043 --> 32:27.034
Now, sit down here.

32:30.081 --> 32:32.379
You trust me, don't you?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.884
I love you.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.648
And-

32:38.423 --> 32:41.392
You love me. Say it.
I love you.

32:44.896 --> 32:47.592
I'll meet you in the bedroom.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.329
<i>[Knocks]</i>

33:38.416 --> 33:42.352
I've been waiting a long time for this.
What about our honeymoon?

33:42.420 --> 33:45.583
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.
That was magical.

33:45.656 --> 33:47.647
Sit down right here.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.553
And put your hands like this.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.561
Now, lean in.

34:11.282 --> 34:14.877
Trudy. Trudy.
The name's Cora.

34:16.954 --> 34:20.685
I'm sorry.
I'm remembering something.

34:20.757 --> 34:23.386
Uh, there's a woman.

34:23.460 --> 34:27.989
I think I'm having an affair
with a woman named Trudy.

34:28.065 --> 34:32.833
I forgive you.
Yeah. I think... I love her.

34:32.904 --> 34:38.501
I don't care.
The truth is, I'm-I'm not
so attracted to you.

34:38.576 --> 34:42.569
Whatever.
The truth is, um,

34:42.647 --> 34:44.581
you sort of terrify me.

34:44.649 --> 34:48.516
Hey. There's no such thing
as a perfect marriage.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.850
Right.
All right, look. This is my fault.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.322
It's too much pressure.
Let's-Let's get out of here.

34:53.391 --> 34:56.188
We'll be spontaneous, huh?

34:56.260 --> 34:59.024
Hey, I know. Let's go to Lookout Point.
That's where all the kids go.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.622
Oh, no, no.
We can't. No.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.862
Remember? The sheriff said, uh,

35:04.936 --> 35:08.633
they were having a problem up there
with the bees and the hornets.

35:08.706 --> 35:13.040
Everybody's getting... stung.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.650
Cora.

35:20.718 --> 35:24.779
Should I lie down?
I think I just solved the case.

35:31.229 --> 35:34.289
Great. Thank you.

35:34.365 --> 35:38.825
Natalie!
Natalie, hey.

35:38.903 --> 35:40.837
We found him.
Is he okay?

35:40.905 --> 35:43.373
We're not sure.
A trucker saw one of the flyers,

35:43.441 --> 35:47.241
called in, said he dropped him off
in Wyoming sometime yesterday.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.711
Wyoming?
Yeah, it's a little town called Purnell.

35:49.780 --> 35:53.181
It's in the middle of nowhere.
The F.B.I.'s loaning us a jet,
and we can be there in two hours.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.914
Okay. Okay. Wait.
Is he sure? Was it really Mr. Monk?

35:56.988 --> 36:00.253
The trucker gave the guy a five-dollar bill,
and the guy kept smoothing it out.

36:00.324 --> 36:03.589
Oh, he's alive! Ooh!

[Yells] There's a-
There's a bee in-in the car.

36:48.372 --> 36:51.398
Well, there's about 20,000 of them out here,
and they don't like visitors.

36:51.475 --> 36:54.467
Here. Put this on.
There you go.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.309
One size fits all.
How's that feel?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.474
[Yells]
Try to relax.

36:59.550 --> 37:03.646
That's the most important thing.
Bees and hornets can smell fear.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.656
The more nervous you get,
the sweeter you are to them.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.591
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
There you go.
Jump in there.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.720
Easy does it. There you go.
Don't panic, now. Don't move fast.

37:12.797 --> 37:16.096
Get your arm in there.
Good.
Yeah.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.762
I got it. I got it.
Sweet as candy.

37:19.837 --> 37:21.828
Put your arm in there.
That's good.
It's all good.

Poor kid.
How did you know where she was?

37:41.659 --> 37:44.355
Uh, it just seemed obvious.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.157
Obvious to <i>you.</i>

37:46.230 --> 37:50.428
Yeah. Here's what I think, uh-

37:50.501 --> 37:53.470
Happened?

37:53.537 --> 37:55.471
Yeah. Yeah.

<i>about Debbie and Roger Zisk.</i>
<i>They were having an affair.</i>

<i>she must have told him</i>
<i>she was pregnant.</i>

<i>She probably threatened</i>
<i>to tell his wife.</i>

38:12.790 --> 38:17.989

Roger just couldn't allow.

<i>He brought the body up here</i>
<i>to dump it.</i>

38:24.335 --> 38:27.168
<i>But he forgot about the bees.</i>
Ow!

38:27.238 --> 38:30.366
<i>They probably stung him</i>
<i>a hundred times.</i>

38:30.441 --> 38:33.035
<i>And now, Roger had a problem.</i>

38:33.110 --> 38:38.480
<i>Eventually, somebody was gonna find</i>
<i>Debbie's body here surrounded by bees,</i>

38:38.549 --> 38:43.213
<i>and when they did, they might remember</i>

<i>the next day covered with bee stings.</i>

<i>He had to get stung again,</i>
<i>this time in public</i>-

I'll give him that.
Mm-hmm.

39:18.122 --> 39:21.250
You figured all that out?
What department are you with?

39:21.325 --> 39:24.123
Actually, I'm a roofer.

Excuse me, uh,
is your gun loaded?
Yeah.

39:29.433 --> 39:34.461
Could you do me a favor?
Could you kill me, please?

39:34.538 --> 39:38.304
Why didn't you just stay in the car?
There's a bee in the car!

39:39.643 --> 39:41.634
There's a bee in the car.

39:45.716 --> 39:49.516
I'm gonna wake up the judge.
Then I'm gonna wake up Mr. Zisk.

You're a great detective

No, really.
What-What's my name?

Adrian.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.778
Really?
Yeah.

40:48.846 --> 40:51.280
Okay.

40:57.855 --> 41:00.380
- Mr. Monk?
- Sheriff.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.858
If you're looking for a job,
my offer's still good.

41:02.927 --> 41:07.057
I appreciate it, but I have
to get back to San Francisco.
