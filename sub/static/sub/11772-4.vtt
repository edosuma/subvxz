00:21.467 --> 00:23.900
( squawking )

00:23.933 --> 00:26.267
I LOVED IT WHEN
IT WAS SO BIG, YOU KNOW?

00:26.300 --> 00:29.367
UNTIL TODAY,
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT,

00:29.400 --> 00:30.733
'CAUSE USUALLY--
HELLO!

00:30.767 --> 00:32.600

00:32.633 --> 00:35.233

00:35.267 --> 00:37.167
I LIKE THAT, A LITTLE BOW.
SEE THAT?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.133
- I DID.
- I LOVE THAT BOW.

00:39.167 --> 00:42.000
I AM NUTS
ABOUT THAT BOW.
IT HUMBLES YOU.

00:42.033 --> 00:45.433
AND WE'VE GOT SO MANY
COCKY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.733
THEY NEED THE HUMILITY
OF THE BOW HERE.

00:47.767 --> 00:50.167
- ( chuckles )
IT'S BIG IN JAPAN.
- YOU SHOULD SEE

00:50.200 --> 00:52.500
SOME OF THE SCULPTURES
THAT WE SAW TODAY.

00:52.533 --> 00:55.433
- REALLY?
- MMM-HMM, THERE'S ONE
THAT I THINK WILL BE

00:55.467 --> 00:57.633
PERFECT IN OUR HOUSE
ONCE WE GET BACK TO IT.

00:57.667 --> 01:01.400
- TELL HIM ABOUT--
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A BIG PENIS.

01:01.433 --> 01:02.967
DID THEY HAVE ANYTHING
AT THE GALLERY?

01:03.067 --> 01:05.400
- UH, NOT QUITE, NO.
- HE'S-- NO.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.067
- WITH SOME BIG BALLS--
- OKAY, WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN...

01:08.067 --> 01:11.300
- THAT'S NICE.
- ...TALKING SERIOUSLY
ABOUT ART, AND IT'S NOT--

01:11.333 --> 01:13.433
LOOK AT THIS.
"COFEY WAS HERE."

01:13.467 --> 01:15.867
- Yoshi: MMM.
- WHAT KIND OF MORON
IS THIS COFEY,

01:15.900 --> 01:18.067
- CARVING HIS NICK--
WHAT IS THAT?
- IT'S A SHAME.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.067
- YEAH, IT'S VERY CHILDISH.
- TAKES A KNIFE OUT

01:20.067 --> 01:22.200
- AND CARVES INTO THE TABLE?
- INAPPROPRIATE.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.167
- HOW INAPPROPRIATE IS THAT?
- MMM.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.900
HEY, BY THE WAY,

01:25.933 --> 01:28.500
MY DAD AND YOUR DAD

01:28.533 --> 01:30.667
ARE BECOMING VERY FRIENDLY
IN THAT NURSING HOME.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.600
- YES, YES.
- OH NO, ISN'T THAT CUTE?

01:32.633 --> 01:35.167
- YEAH.
- IT WAS JUST HIS
80th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.133
WE TOOK HIM TO JAPAN.

01:37.167 --> 01:39.067
- NO KIDDING?
- REALLY?

01:39.067 --> 01:41.500
YES, HE HADN'T BEEN BACK
SINCE THE WAR.

01:41.533 --> 01:44.100
HE SAW
SOME OF HIS FAMILY...

01:44.133 --> 01:46.267
- OH MY GOSH.
- ...AND SOME OF HIS
MILITARY BUDDIES

01:46.300 --> 01:48.067
- FROM THE AIR FORCE.
- HE WAS IN THE WAR?

01:48.100 --> 01:50.700
- HUH, WOW.
- WHAT DID HE DO
IN THE WAR?

01:50.733 --> 01:54.700
- HE WAS A PILOT.
- REALLY? WHAT KIND
OF A PILOT?

01:54.733 --> 01:57.367
- A KAMIKAZE PILOT.
- WOW.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.067
MMM.

01:59.067 --> 02:01.167
- HMM.
- WOW.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.833
- WOULDN'T HE BE DEAD?
- UM, NOT ALL OF THEM DIED.

02:05.867 --> 02:10.067
I KNOW, BUT KAMIKAZE PILOT
KIND OF IMPLIES

02:10.100 --> 02:11.200
THAT, YOU KNOW--
A KAMIKAZE PILOT

02:11.233 --> 02:13.767
IS A PILOT WHO CRASHED
AND DIED, RIGHT?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.467
- BUT HE DIDN'T.
- HE SURVIVED, YES.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.500
- THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.
- HE SURVIVED?

02:17.533 --> 02:20.200
- HERE'S TO--
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- KANPAI.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.867
WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY?
DID HE TRY

02:22.900 --> 02:25.300
AND CRASH THE PLANE
INTO A SHIP?

02:25.333 --> 02:29.567
AHEM, HE GRAZED THE SHIP.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.867
- MMM.
- OKAY.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.100
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT,
HE GRAZED THE SHIP.

02:34.133 --> 02:37.467
- HE GRAZED IT.
- HMM, IS THAT BECAUSE

02:37.500 --> 02:40.333
THERE WAS
SOME KIND OF MALFUNCTION
WITH THE PLANE?

02:40.367 --> 02:42.200
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
HE GRAZED IT...

02:42.233 --> 02:44.400
- I'M JUST CURIOUS.
- ...AND HE LIVED, AND...

02:44.433 --> 02:47.067
- AND HE IS ALIVE.
- ...AND HE'S ALIVE.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.833
YEAH, BUT AT THE LAST
SECOND, WHAT HAPPENED?

02:48.867 --> 02:51.067
WAS HE COMING DOWN,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE SAID,

02:51.067 --> 02:54.933
YOU KNOW, "JESUS,
THIS KAMIKAZE BUSINESS
MIGHT NOT BE FOR ME.

02:54.967 --> 02:58.067
I THINK MAYBE I'LL...
GO BACK TO BASE"?

02:58.067 --> 03:01.733
- OKAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
- WAS IS SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, HUH?

03:01.767 --> 03:04.133
SO WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE LAST SECOND THERE?

03:05.067 --> 03:08.333
I'M UNCERTAIN.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.267
- HMM.
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD

03:10.300 --> 03:13.067
IS THE RAINBOW ROLL,
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU

03:13.100 --> 03:15.300
- A LITTLE BIT
OF EVERYTHING. HI.

03:15.333 --> 03:19.167
- Cheryl: YES.

THE CHICKEN TERIYAKI.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.933

03:23.067 --> 03:26.267
Waiter:

03:26.300 --> 03:28.900

03:28.933 --> 03:30.067
HOW ABOUT YOU, YOSH?

03:30.067 --> 03:32.133
A LITTLE CHICKEN?

03:35.167 --> 03:37.567
Larry:
SO, YOU KNOW, I HIRED
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

03:37.600 --> 03:38.833
TO FIND OUT
IF I'M ADOPTED.

03:38.867 --> 03:41.733
WHAT DO YOU CARE NOW FOR?
ISN'T THE DAMAGE DONE ALREADY

03:41.767 --> 03:45.067
- FROM YOUR PARENTS?
- I WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

03:45.067 --> 03:47.067
HEY, HOW'S LEWIS?
YOU HEAR FROM LEWIS?

03:47.067 --> 03:48.900
HE'S--
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HIS KIDNEY.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.633
OH YEAH?
WHAT, LIKE A STONE
OR SOMETHING?

03:50.667 --> 03:54.600
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT.
HE'S GETTING TESTS.
- FOLD YOUR CARD.

03:54.633 --> 03:57.567
- I JUST KNOW HE'S CONCERNED.
- HE GETS SO WORKED UP.
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.700
- HE DOESN'T LOOK
THAT GOOD.
- I'M IN.

03:59.733 --> 04:02.800
I PRESENT TO YOU A STRAIGHT

04:02.833 --> 04:05.167
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.500
- AGAIN?
- YEAH, THAT'S A NICE HAND.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.400
- I THINK IT'S A TRICK DECK.
- HE WAS BORN TO POKER PLAYERS

04:10.433 --> 04:13.233
- AND GIVEN UP FOR ADOPTION.
- HERE ARE SOME PRETZELS.

04:13.267 --> 04:17.067
- All: OH, THANK YOU.
- Man: DID THE PIZZA PLACE
CALL BY ANY CHANCE?

04:17.067 --> 04:19.800
- Man: HEY, ISN'T
YOUR BROTHER PLAYING?
- YEAH, WHERE'S YOSHI?

04:19.833 --> 04:22.267
YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR BROTHER?
HE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT

04:22.300 --> 04:24.767
- HE WAS COMING.
- YEAH, YOSHI'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.767
BUT I CAN'T GET A HOLD OF HIM.
MAYBE HE'S STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.767
HEY, SO OUR FATHERS ARE
BECOMING VERY FRIENDLY

04:30.800 --> 04:32.467

04:41.067 --> 04:44.233
- THAT I FEEL
ANY OPTIMIST ABOUT.
- YOU PLAY BINGO?

04:44.267 --> 04:46.967
WHEN I PLAY
I THINK I'M GONNA WIN.
ISN'T THAT INSANE?

04:47.067 --> 04:48.500
- DO YOU WIN?
- I DO WIN.

04:48.533 --> 04:50.333
- ( phone ringing )
- IT'S COMPLETELY RANDOM.

04:50.367 --> 04:53.300
I KNOW IT'S RANDOM.
I HAVE A WINNING PERCENTAGE

04:53.333 --> 04:55.067
- THAT DEFIES LOGIC.
- HELLO, YEAH.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.367

04:57.400 --> 05:00.533

05:00.567 --> 05:03.233
OH MY GOD.

05:09.733 --> 05:12.233
HE TRIED
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.
CEDARS SINAI.

05:12.267 --> 05:14.867

05:35.300 --> 05:37.733
I JUST SAW HIM LAST NIGHT.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.233
WE HAD DINNER WITH HIM.

05:39.267 --> 05:42.200
YOU DID?
DID HE SEEM WEIRD?

05:43.633 --> 05:46.800
- NO.
- WAS HE NERVOUS?
WAS HE ANXIOUS?

05:46.833 --> 05:49.433
COULD HE HAVE LOST FACE
OR HAVE BEEN ASHAMED

05:49.467 --> 05:51.633
OR HUMILIATED
OR ANYTHING?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.633
UH...

05:58.500 --> 06:00.733
( sighs )

06:03.067 --> 06:04.867
SO...

06:04.900 --> 06:07.167
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

06:12.200 --> 06:14.933
WELL, YOU KNOW,

06:14.967 --> 06:17.200
- WE'RE HERE.
- Jeff: WE ARE HERE.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.133
THAT'S TRUE,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

06:19.167 --> 06:22.433
I HAD TO REALLY FINAGLE
TO GET OUT TONIGHT.

06:22.467 --> 06:24.200
I'M KINDA HAPPY
TO BE ANYWHERE.

06:24.233 --> 06:26.833
AND YOU KNOW,
WE CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.

06:26.867 --> 06:29.600
- IT'S-- THEY'RE GONE.
- Jeff: WE DON'T HAVE KEYS.

06:29.633 --> 06:32.267
AND WE DON'T KNOW
THE ALARM CODE OR ANYTHING.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.467
- AND A PIZZA IS COMING.
- GOT A PIZZA COMING.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.933
YEAH, GOT A PIZZA COMING.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.400
AND HE TRIED, HE DIDN'T
ACTUALLY KILL HIMSELF.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.367
- All: RIGHT.
- THAT'S A VERY
GOOD DISTINCTION.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.967
- BECAUSE IF HE SAID
HE TRIED TO...
- RIGHT.

06:43.067 --> 06:46.100
- THAT MEANS HE DIDN'T,
WHICH MEANS HE'S ALIVE.
- HE'S HERE.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.367
- THANK GOD.

06:48.400 --> 06:52.500

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

07:13.567 --> 07:16.067
- All: HEY.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.267

07:18.300 --> 07:20.200
- I TOOK AN ORANGE.
- YOU WANT SOME PIZZA?

07:20.233 --> 07:23.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- Larry: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:23.333 --> 07:25.800
YOSHI'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
HE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE!

07:25.833 --> 07:27.500

- Man: HE'S OKAY, RIGHT?

07:27.533 --> 07:30.700

WE SHOULD LEAVE.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.867

- All: YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.467
- HEY, GET OUT!
- YOU ORDERED ANOTHER PIZZA!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.200
- GET THE FUCK OUT.
- All: WHAT?

07:39.233 --> 07:41.567
- IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER. OUT.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.400
OUT. OUT.
IT'S OVER. IT'S OVER.
LEAVE. LEAVE.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.800

CAN WE SETTLE UP?

07:46.833 --> 07:49.533
- I WAS UP ABOUT $400.
- LET'S GO. OUT. OUT.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.067
- MAN, OH MAN.
- LET'S GO.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.733
PIZZA WAS COMING,
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE
TO LEAVE A PIZZA GUY--

07:53.767 --> 07:56.433
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE
TO STOP AND PICK IT UP
ON YOUR WAY HOME, TOO.

07:56.467 --> 07:59.433
- WE DIDN'T KNOW
YOUR ALARM CODE.
- I DON'T HAVE AN ALARM!

07:59.467 --> 08:03.800
HEY, DID YOSHI
MENTION MY NAME?

08:03.833 --> 08:06.633
- HE'S GOT TUBES
COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
- OKAY.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.200
- THAT MEANS NO.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:08.233 --> 08:10.267
- GET THE FUCK OUT.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.367
SAY HELLO FOR ME
IF YOU SEE HIM.

08:19.267 --> 08:22.067
OH MY GOD, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOSHI?

08:22.067 --> 08:24.167
( sighs )
YEAH, HE'S OKAY, THOUGH.
HE DIDN'T-- HE'S FINE.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.067
- THANK GOD!
- YEAH.

08:27.100 --> 08:31.267
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- HE SENT ME A SUICIDE EMAIL.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.933
A SUICIDE EMAIL?!

08:32.967 --> 08:36.333
HE HAD SOME THINGS
HE WANTED TO SAY
BEFORE HE--

08:36.367 --> 08:38.700
WHAT DID HE SAY?

08:38.733 --> 08:40.767
IT'S VERY PRIVATE, LARRY.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.733
- ( sighs )
- HEY, WE'RE MARRIED,
YOU KNOW.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.667
IT'S PART OF THE WHOLE
MARRIAGE THING.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.300
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED,

08:48.333 --> 08:51.333
YOU NOT ONLY GET THE SEX,
BUT YOU GET ALL THE OTHER
STUFF TOO.

08:51.367 --> 08:54.433
ALL THE INFORMATION
FROM THE WIFE WHO DOESN'T
HOLD ANY SECRETS.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.633
IF HE WANTED YOU TO SEE IT,
HE WOULD HAVE COPIED YOU.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.100
DID HE COPY OTHER PEOPLE?

09:01.133 --> 09:03.500
HE CC'd
A FEW PEOPLE, YES.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.767
( yells )
ARE YOU KIDDING?!

09:10.433 --> 09:11.800
I WANNA KNOW.
WHAT DID HE SAY?

09:11.833 --> 09:13.467
STOP IT!
I'LL DELETE IT.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.733
I'LL DELETE IT.
STOP IT, GET OFF ME.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.100
( loudly )

09:35.233 --> 09:37.500
NOT IN MY PURVIEW.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.933
I-20.

09:39.967 --> 09:41.967
- I-20.
- I-20?

09:42.067 --> 09:44.367
- I-20.
- BINGO!

09:44.400 --> 09:46.100
OH, HE HAS--
OH MY.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.333
- BINGO.
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

09:48.367 --> 09:50.267
- BINGO.
- Leader: ALL RIGHT.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.833
- LET ME SEE, LET ME--
- YOU'RE NOT THE CHECKER.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.367
- LENORE IS THE CHECKER.
- LENORE, LENORE,
CHECK THIS OUT.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.067
- BINGO. WATCH.
- LET'S SEE IT.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.200
OKAY...

10:01.267 --> 10:02.800
OKAY, I'M SORRY, SIR.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.667
I DID NOT CALL I-17.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.033
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
- NO, I NEVER DID.

10:08.067 --> 10:10.200
- YEAH, I-17.
- THAT IS NOT CORRECT.

10:10.233 --> 10:13.000
- I DID NOT CALL I-17.
- YOU-- EXCUSE ME,
EXCUSE ME--

10:13.033 --> 10:16.133
HA-HA, HA-HA, HA-HA.
CHEAT.

10:16.167 --> 10:18.067
- ALL RIGHT, JUST BE PATIENT.
- YOU CALLED I-17.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.933
- LET ME SEE THAT PAD.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SEE THIS PAD.

10:20.967 --> 10:23.800
- NOBODY CHECKS OUT THIS PAD.
- WHY CAN'T I CHECK OUT
YOUR PAD?

10:23.833 --> 10:28.100
- BECAUSE I NEVER LET ANYONE
LOOK AT MY PAD.
- REALLY? AHA.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.667
- SHE NEVER DOES.
- GOOD FOR YOU, LENORE.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.767
( laughs )
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE
WITH THE GAME.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.300
- HA-HA-HA.
- Lenore: JUST TRY TO RELAX.

10:36.333 --> 10:39.267
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO HER.
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.867
WELL, LISTEN,
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

10:44.400 --> 10:47.900
G-55.

10:47.933 --> 10:50.600
- ( screaming )
- WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

10:50.633 --> 10:52.000
- I DON'T KNOW
THE NUMBER.
- BINGO!

10:52.033 --> 10:52.967
- OH, SHE--
OH, SHE HAS--
- BINGO!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.800
- Lenore: OH!
- SHE HAS BINGO.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.367
- Lenore: RUTHIE,
DO WE HAVE BINGO?
- OOH-OOH.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.267
- Ruthie: B-I-N-G-O!
- LET ME SEE, RUTHIE.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.167
- THERE IT IS.
- OH, WELL...

11:02.200 --> 11:05.167
- ( Nat laughs )
SHE HAS THE BINGO.
- OH YES, PERFECT!

11:05.200 --> 11:07.633
- YES, OF COURSE.
- RUTHIE GETS A DOLLAR!

11:07.667 --> 11:11.400
- HA-HA, I WON A DOLLAR!
- ( all cheering )

11:11.433 --> 11:13.700
I WON, EVERYBODY!
I WON!

11:13.733 --> 11:16.067
- BINGO!
- OH, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.933
( crowd booing )

11:17.967 --> 11:20.367
I HAD BINGO.
YOU ALL KNOW I HAD BINGO.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.767
Ruthie:
AND I WON YOUR DOLLAR.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.100
( whispering )
THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY
GOING ON IN THIS PLACE.

11:27.133 --> 11:30.300
I'M GONNA BUY YOU
A PIECE OF CHEESECAKE.
( chuckling )

11:30.333 --> 11:32.967
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I LOVE CHEESECAKE.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.533
( silent )

11:37.800 --> 11:40.867
...101.
ACTUALLY I TOOK THE 110

11:40.900 --> 11:43.400
- UP TO THE--
THROUGH THE PASS.
- OH, HEY.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.133
HELLO.

11:46.167 --> 11:48.133
HEY, MY WIFE TELLS ME

11:48.167 --> 11:49.767
YOSHI'S DOING GREAT.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.733
YEAH, HE'S FINE.
HE'S HOME NOW.

11:51.767 --> 11:53.767
GOOD NEWS!
FANTASTIC.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.433
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED
IN THAT BINGO GAME?

11:57.467 --> 12:01.367
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
ANYTHING STRANGE
GOING ON THERE?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.833
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, LARRY.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.667
DON'T, DON'T TRY
TO GET INVOLVED.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.800
DON'T TRY TO PRETEND
YOU'RE CONCERNED.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.433
- I WAS CONCERNED.
- CONCERNED?

12:11.467 --> 12:13.267
WHEN WE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,
I COME BACK,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.767
YOU GUYS ARE ALL STILL
PLAYING POKER, SMOKING,
EATING PIZZA.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.067
THAT'S WHY WE WERE THERE,
BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED.

12:19.067 --> 12:22.800
WE WANTED TO SHOW SUPPORT,
WHEN YOU GOT HOME YOUR
BUDDIES WOULD BE THERE

12:22.833 --> 12:25.067
AND YOU'RE TURNING IT
INTO A BAD THING.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.867
YOSHI TRIED
TO COMMIT SUICIDE,

12:26.900 --> 12:28.633
AND YOU JUST COMPLETELY
PUT IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.833
WE DIDN'T PUT IT OUT.
WE THOUGHT OF IT
BETWEEN HANDS.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.300
HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE
CONCERNED ABOUT--

12:33.333 --> 12:36.767
YOU'RE THE REASON
WHY YOSHI TRIED TO COMMIT
SUICIDE.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.533
COME ON,
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

12:38.567 --> 12:40.600
THE WHOLE KAMIKAZE THING.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.400
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IT,
SO I ASKED.

12:42.433 --> 12:44.767
EXCUSE ME FOR HAVING
A CURIOUS MIND

12:44.800 --> 12:46.700
THAT ASKS QUESTIONS
OF PEOPLE.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.700
I'M CURIOUS
ABOUT HOW YOU CAN BE
A KAMIKAZE PILOT

12:49.733 --> 12:51.433
- AND STILL BE ALIVE.
- THERE'S A LOT

12:51.467 --> 12:53.933
OF KAMIKAZE PILOTS
THAT ARE STILL ALIVE.

12:53.967 --> 12:56.400
YOU SAY THAT,
AND I SAY TO YOU,

12:56.433 --> 12:58.367
THEY ARE NOT
KAMIKAZE PILOTS.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.533
"HE GRAZED THE SHIP."
THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

13:01.567 --> 13:04.833
"I THINK I MIGHT HEAD HOME.
THIS IS FUCKING INSANE."

13:04.867 --> 13:07.933
YOU TAUNTED HIM,
YOU CALLED HIM CHICKEN.

13:07.967 --> 13:10.367
I DIDN'T CALL HIM CHICKEN,
I ORDERED CHICKEN!

13:10.400 --> 13:14.267
- YOU CALLED HIM CHICKEN.
- I ORDERED CHICKEN, YOU IDIOT.
THERE'S THE DIFFERENCE.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.567
"YOU'RE A CHICKEN."
"I'LL HAVE SOME CHICKEN."

13:16.600 --> 13:19.067
"YOU'RE A CHICKEN."
"I'D LIKE A PIECE OF CHICKEN."

13:19.067 --> 13:21.567
WELL, HE UNDERSTOOD IT
AS YOU CALLING HIM A CHICKEN.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.167
HE MUST HAVE TAKEN IT
THE WRONG WAY.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.533
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU
SWEEPING THE CHIPS
OFF THE TABLE?

13:26.567 --> 13:28.600
YOU COST ME
A LOT OF MONEY.
I KNOW FOR A FACT

13:28.633 --> 13:31.400
YOU WERE DOWN $300.
YOU ACTUALLY OWE ME $300

13:31.433 --> 13:33.633
- IF YOU WANNA GET
TECHNICAL ABOUT IT.
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

13:33.667 --> 13:35.633
I'LL GET YOUR CHIPS BACK,
YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY BACK,

13:35.667 --> 13:38.533
BUT YOU'RE GOTTA DO ONE THING--
YOU GOTTA CALL YOSHI AT HOME

13:38.567 --> 13:41.433
AND APOLOGIZE FOR THE WHOLE
KAMIKAZE STATEMENT

13:41.467 --> 13:44.167
- AND THE CHICKEN THING.
- OKAY, I WILL.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.200
- OKAY.
- I'M GONNA CALL HIM
AND APOLOZE.

13:46.233 --> 13:48.133
- OKAY.
- I'LL USE
MY DAD'S PHONE.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.667
Yoshi:
HELLO.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.233
Larry:
Oh, hey, Yoshi,
this is Larry David.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.767
OH, HELLO LARRY.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.067
I'm actually--
I'm calling to apologize.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.833
I'M SORRY
IF I SAID ANYTHING

14:01.867 --> 14:03.600
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
INAPPROPRIATE.
( crunching )

14:03.633 --> 14:08.067
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.233
I WAS JUST KINDA CURIOUS...

14:10.267 --> 14:12.133
( chewing )
...with the whole
kamikaze thing.

14:12.167 --> 14:15.733
- You know, I hope--
- ARE YOU EATING SOMETHING?

14:15.767 --> 14:18.533
I'M EATING
PISTACHIO NUTS.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.067
YOU'RE EATING
PISTACHIO NUTS

14:20.067 --> 14:22.500
WHILE YOU'RE
APOLOGIZING TO ME?

14:22.533 --> 14:23.567
YES, SO?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.433
YOU CAN'T BE SINCERE
ABOUT APOLOGIZING

14:25.467 --> 14:27.433
AND THEN SNACK
ON PISTACHIO NUTS!

14:27.467 --> 14:29.200
WHAT?
I CAN EAT AND APOLOGIZE.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.833
THERE'S NO
PISTACHIO CRUNCHING
IN APOLOGIZING.

14:31.867 --> 14:35.067
I respectfully disagree.
I've snacked and apologized
many times

14:35.067 --> 14:36.933
and everyone's
always accepted it
quite graciously.

14:36.967 --> 14:39.600
THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY
YOU DO THINGS IN YOUR FAMILY,

14:39.633 --> 14:41.500
BUT WE DON'T SNACK
AND APOLOGIZE--

14:41.533 --> 14:43.433
WHAT, IS THAT
A JAPANESE THING?

14:43.467 --> 14:45.900
NO!
NO, THAT'S A HUMAN THING--

14:45.933 --> 14:49.567
HEY, DID YOU MENTION ME
IN THAT SUICIDE EMAIL?

14:57.633 --> 14:59.467
- HI.
- OH LARRY,
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.167
- HOW ARE YOU, DR. SKADDEN?
- I'M GOOD. HOW'S YOUR DAD?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.533
- I THINK HE'S DOING WELL.
- HE'S DOING REAL WELL.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.567
I'M GONNA WRITE HIM
A LITTLE PRESCRIPTION THOUGH.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.433
- MAYBE YOU WANT
TO HAVE IT FILLED.
- OKAY.

15:08.467 --> 15:11.600
- A LITTLE BLOOD THINNER.
- UM...

15:11.633 --> 15:14.500
YOU KNOW,
I'M KINDA GLAD
I RAN INTO YOU.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.067
I WANNA TALK
TO YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT SOMETHING

15:16.100 --> 15:18.733
THAT HAPPENED
TO ME TODAY.

15:18.767 --> 15:21.967
- AND LET'S KEEP THIS
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, OKAY?
- SURE.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.233
IN THE BINGO GAME TODAY...

15:25.767 --> 15:28.900
I WON, I YELLED "BINGO."

15:28.933 --> 15:30.267
LENORE, THE WOMAN
WHO RUNS THE GAME,

15:30.300 --> 15:32.467
CAME OVER,
LOOKED AT MY CARD

15:32.500 --> 15:34.300
AND SAID SHE DIDN'T CALL
ONE OF THE NUMBERS.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.767
NOW LOOK, I CAN HEAR
BETTER THAN ANYBODY

15:35.800 --> 15:39.500
IN THAT ROOM, OKAY?
SHE CALLED MY NUMBER.

15:39.533 --> 15:43.233
I LISTEN, I PAY ATTENTION.
I'M A GOOD BINGO PLAYER.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.900
A MINUTE LATER RUTH WINS.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.167
LENORE CAME OVER,

15:46.200 --> 15:48.300
AND SHE GIVES THE DOLLAR
TO HER FRIEND.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.433
AND DON'T TELL ME,
AFTER THAT GAME

15:51.467 --> 15:54.133
HER FRIEND RUTHIE
WASN'T GIVING HER 50¢,
ALL RIGHT?

15:54.167 --> 15:55.933
I WON THAT GAME,
FAIR AND SQUARE.
FAIR AND SQUARE.

15:55.967 --> 15:58.900
OKAY, SO LARRY, YOU THINK
LENORE IS TAKING KICK-BACK

15:58.933 --> 16:00.833
- FROM CALLING THE NUMBERS?
- YES, I DO.

16:00.867 --> 16:02.967
I THINK THE BINGO GAME
IS FIXED.

16:03.067 --> 16:07.300
I THINK LENORE IS
EITHER IN CAHOOTS WITH RUTH

16:07.333 --> 16:09.500
OR MAYBE EVEN
A FEW OTHER PEOPLE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.833
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

16:11.867 --> 16:13.933
TAKE OFF YOUR
LITTLE SMOCK HERE,

16:13.967 --> 16:16.100
TAKE OFF YOUR TIE,
SIT IN ON A GAME,

16:16.133 --> 16:18.933
KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN.
KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN.
LISTEN,

16:18.967 --> 16:20.867
TO SEE WHO'S WINNING
AT THE BINGO GAME.

16:20.900 --> 16:25.133
YOU WANT ME TO GO
UNDERCOVER TO PLAY BINGO?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

16:25.167 --> 16:26.967
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS GAME, DOCTOR,

16:27.067 --> 16:29.100
THAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

16:29.133 --> 16:31.867
I KNOW THE BINGO IS
FOR THE RESIDENTS, LARRY.

16:31.900 --> 16:35.267
AND I KNOW IT TAKES PLACE
ON WEDNESDAYS AND FRIDAYS.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.967
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW,
AND I KNOW THEY ENJOY IT.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.733
WELL, IN A WEEK OR TWO,
YOU'RE GONNA COME UP
TO ME AND GO,

16:40.767 --> 16:43.133
"LARRY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:43.167 --> 16:45.067
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT BINGO GAME."

16:45.067 --> 16:47.533
- I WILL CHECK INTO IT.
- GOOD, THAT'S ALL I ASK.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.167
- I'LL BE HAPPY TO.
- THAT'S ALL I ASK.
JUST ASK AROUND.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.667
DO A LITTLE CHECK INTO IT.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.367
- I'M NOT ASKING A LOT.
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.367
- THANK YOU. OKAY.
- OKAY, LARRY.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
- YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- YOU TOO.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.733
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

17:03.767 --> 17:06.133
I'M WELL.
I HAVE A PRESCRIPTION.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.067
OKAY.

17:09.567 --> 17:12.733
- IS THIS FOR YOU?
- NO, IT'S FOR MY FATHER.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.667
FATHER.
BLOOD THINNER.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.367
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ANOTHER
DRUG OUT ON THE MARKET

17:21.400 --> 17:24.833
THAT I PERSONALLY LIKE
A LOT BETTER.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.933
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.733
MY PATIENTS ARE--

17:28.767 --> 17:31.367
THEY'RE A LOT HAPPIER
WITH THE OTHER DRUG.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.667
HUH.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.600
IF YOU LIKE, I COULD
WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.467
BUT THE DOCTOR
PREFERS THIS ONE.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.067
YES,

17:45.967 --> 17:48.833
BUT I PREFER
THE OTHER ONE.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.433
BUT HE LIKES THIS ONE.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.467
BUT I LIKE THAT ONE.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.067
DOCTOR...

18:02.233 --> 18:05.067
PHARMACIST.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.067
- ( drum roll playing )
- DOCTOR!

18:08.833 --> 18:10.833
PHARMACIST.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.433
( cymbal crashes )

18:15.467 --> 18:17.800
I'LL GO
WITH THE PHARMACIST.

18:17.833 --> 18:21.067
- I'M GOING
WITH THE PHARMACIST.
- YES, SIR.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.767
I'M TAKING THIS TO THE DOCTOR,
I'M GETTING A NEW PRESCRIPTION

18:23.800 --> 18:25.933
- AND I'LL BE BACK,
MR. PHARMACIST.
- I'M GLAD.

18:25.967 --> 18:28.300
- I'M GOING WITH YOU.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.600
( whistling )

18:35.767 --> 18:37.767
- HEY.
- HEY LARRY,
HOW ARE YOU?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.800
ANY PROGRESS ON, UH...

18:40.833 --> 18:42.633
THE BINGO BUSINESS?

18:42.667 --> 18:44.333
- NO, NO WORD ON THE BINGO.
- NOTHIN'?

18:44.367 --> 18:45.867
NOTHIN'.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.633
KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THIS RUTH.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.533
- RUTH?
- YEAH, RUTH.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.167
SHE'S BAD NEWS.
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS WOMAN

18:53.200 --> 18:55.633
I DON'T TRUST.
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT
INTO THIS PLACE.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.067
DON'T THEY HAVE
A SCREENING PROCESS
OF SOME KIND?

18:58.100 --> 19:02.067
YES, LARRY, WE SCREEN THEM
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE OLD
AND SICK AND NEED CARE.

19:02.067 --> 19:04.967
WELL, SHE'S GOT SOME KIND
OF PERSONALITY DISORDER
I THINK.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.300
WELL, SHE'S ON A LOT
OF MEDICATION.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.067
YOU THINK THAT'S
AN EXCUSE REALLY?

19:09.100 --> 19:12.367
THAT'S LIKE
THE TWINKIE DEFENSE.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.367
I'LL CONTINUE
TO INVESTIGATE, LARRY.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.800
OKAY.
UM, ONE OTHER THING.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.867
I JUST CAME
FROM THE PHARMACIST.

19:19.900 --> 19:23.167
HE KINDA WANTS
TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY
WITH THE MEDICATION.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.067
SORTA DISAGREED WITH YOU.

19:25.067 --> 19:26.900
THE PHARMACIST?

19:26.933 --> 19:29.400
YEAH, HE WROTE OUT
A DRUG HERE.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.667
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT I NEED A PRESCRIPTION

19:31.700 --> 19:34.767
FROM YOU FOR THIS.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.067
YOU NEED A PRESCRIPTION
FROM ME FOR SOMETHING
THE PHARMACIST

19:37.100 --> 19:40.367
- HAS SUGGESTED?
- HE WAS QUITE PASSIONATE
ABOUT IT.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.467
YOU KNOW, HE DEALS
WITH THIS STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.233
I'M A DOCTOR, LARRY.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.133
WELL, HE'S A PHARMACIST.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.533
YES, AND I'M A DOCTOR.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.733
HE'S A PHARMACIST.

19:54.767 --> 19:57.333
- DOCTOR.
- PHARMACIST.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.167
DOCTOR.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.167
PHARMACIST.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.600
FINE, YOU GO

21:04.800 --> 21:06.533
SO WHAT?
I CAN'T HEAR,
YOU KNOW?

21:06.567 --> 21:09.567
- IT'S TOO LOUD!

I CAN'T HEAR.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.867
PLEASE--
OH, YOU TURNED IT OFF.

21:12.900 --> 21:16.100
WE CAN'T WATCH
PORNO TOGETHER.
I DON'T THINK--

21:16.133 --> 21:18.100
WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP YET.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.433
- BUT YOU RUINED IT
FOR ME NOW.
- SORRY.

21:20.467 --> 21:23.400

21:23.433 --> 21:26.067

21:29.767 --> 21:31.700

21:31.733 --> 21:34.300
OF COURSE SHE WINS A LOT.
THIS WOMAN IS A WINNER.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.067
SHE WINS A LOT?

21:36.067 --> 21:38.633
YES, OF COURSE
SHE WINS A LOT.
SHE PLAYS A LOT--

21:38.667 --> 21:40.100

- COME IN.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.633
HELLO THERE, NATTIE!

21:42.667 --> 21:45.100
( chuckles )
HELLO, RUTHIE.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.567
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.600

21:49.633 --> 21:51.333
THIS IS WONDERFUL.

21:51.367 --> 21:53.900
SO WHAT ARE YOU
TWO GUYS TALKING ABOUT?

21:53.933 --> 21:57.300

21:57.333 --> 21:59.733
THE JAPANESE GUY,
HIS SON TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF.

21:59.767 --> 22:01.167
BUT HE'S HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.067
- HE DIDN'T DIE.

22:04.067 --> 22:07.067

22:07.067 --> 22:09.067
( yells )
NO, "DIE."

22:09.067 --> 22:12.233
DIE, DIE, DIE!

22:27.067 --> 22:28.567

22:31.400 --> 22:33.233
( laughs )

22:33.267 --> 22:37.533
I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THE DOCTOR WAS UPSET.

22:37.567 --> 22:40.133
DOCTORS DON'T LIKE
TO HAVE THEIR AUTHORITY
QUESTIONED.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.500
I TOLD HIM I HAD TO GO
WITH THE PHARMACIST,
YOU KNOW?

22:42.533 --> 22:46.400
WE SEE A LOT OF DRUGS.
I THINK THIS IS
A GOOD CHOICE.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.700
IS THAT YOUR NAME?

22:49.733 --> 22:52.100
COFEY?

22:52.133 --> 22:54.467

22:56.500 --> 23:00.200

ALL THE TIME.

23:01.067 --> 23:05.400
SO COFEY WAS THERE.

23:05.433 --> 23:07.200
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.367
YOU KNOW WHAT, COFEY?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.367
I THINK I'LL GO

SOME OF THIS EEL?

23:25.833 --> 23:29.200

25:05.633 --> 25:08.300
