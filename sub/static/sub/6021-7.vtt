00:09.042 --> 00:11.237
-Hey.
-Morning.

00:11.411 --> 00:15.006
Oh, this is crazy.
You know, I can't go on like this.

00:15.181 --> 00:18.947
-But why?
-I need some space.

00:21.087 --> 00:22.952
Does that mean I have to go too?

00:23.123 --> 00:25.421
Well, you don't think
she's just talking to me.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.355
-Hey, shut up.
-You shut up.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.290
I hate this.

00:30.063 --> 00:33.294
You'll get used to it.
It's like a rugby scrum.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.560
-No. No, I don't want this anymore.
-We're going to work with you.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.431
-And on your dates.
-And shopping.

00:38.605 --> 00:39.936
And to the bathroom.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.097
-Elaine. Elaine. Elaine.
-I can't breathe.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.903
-Elaine. Elaine.
-I'm suffocating. I can't breathe.

00:45.078 --> 00:47.410
You're all killing me.

00:55.121 --> 00:57.715
Turn your alarm off.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:06.933 --> 01:08.958
Your background
is impressive, George.

01:09.135 --> 01:13.834
But how does it apply to what we do
here at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?

01:14.007 --> 01:17.374
Well, at the Yankees, it was
all about smoothing things over...

01:17.544 --> 01:20.172
...you know, chiseling away,
grinding down.

01:20.346 --> 01:23.645
In fact, we used to call it the grind.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.947
It says here you worked at Play Now
for four days.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.215
That should be a 14.
Let me just....

01:33.393 --> 01:37.261
Well, George, I'll be honest.
I could go either way on you.

01:38.798 --> 01:40.925
But what the hell,
we need someone, huh?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.659
You won't regret this, sir.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.898
I don't care.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.775
Let's find you an office, huh?

01:58.184 --> 02:00.675
When I saw the photo
I remembered where I'd seen him.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.014
The boom-box incident.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.815
The boom-box incident?

02:03.990 --> 02:05.924
Summer of '89,
I'm at the beach.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.787
This family sets up next to me.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.425
I go into the surf.
When I come out...

02:10.597 --> 02:14.124
...my clothes, my towel,
my umbrella, they're all gone.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.860
I am furious.
I start screaming at these kids...

02:17.036 --> 02:19.504
...demanding my stuff back
and finally I lose it.

02:19.672 --> 02:23.768
I grab their boom box
and I chuck it into the ocean.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.807
-Yeah.
-Seems reasonable.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.775
Then I see my clothes
floating out there.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.645
The tide took them out, not the kids.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.548
Even more reasonable.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.814
So now the father
is screaming at me.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.890
He 's demanding I pay
for the boom box.

02:39.058 --> 02:43.358
So finally I gave him a fake address
and got the hell out of there.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.555
And that guy is your new boss?

02:45.732 --> 02:48.223
Until that stupid photo
jogs his memory.

02:48.401 --> 02:52.064
Kruger. That's not Kruger
Industrial Smoothing, is it?

02:52.238 --> 02:54.968
-Yeah.
-Yeah, grinders, sanders, whetstones.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.268
They botched
the Statue of Liberty job.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.843
Right. They couldn't
get the green stuff off.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.176
It is a horrible company.
There is no management whatsoever.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.579
I could go hog-wild in there.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.280
You know what to do?
You sneak that photo out...

03:08.454 --> 03:10.581
...for a couple of days
and get it airbrushed.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.782
-Like retouched?
-Remember the photo of me...

03:12.959 --> 03:14.722
...and Gerald Ford and I took it in.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.556
Got that Ford right out of there.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.291
Oh, this is good.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.127
This Kruger guy is clueless.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.930
I can't wait to work for him.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.636
Jeez. Look at this.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.208
This sandwich is terrible.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.608
Everywhere you go they always give
you these misshaped, shoddy meats.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.544
Look, look, look.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.782
I haven't had a decent sandwich
in 13 years.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.923
Neither have l.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.720
Hey.
Well, our meat problems are solved.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.396
-Where'd you get this thing?
-I traded in my sausage press.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.469
I mean, look how thin that is.
See, that's all surface area.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.232
The taste has nowhere to hide.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.737
-Hey.
-Hey. Slice?

04:05.311 --> 04:06.972
Welcome to flavor country.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.408
Hey, that's pretty good.

04:09.682 --> 04:11.650
Hey, I got a date
with that doctor you met.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.277
Sara Sitarides?

04:16.755 --> 04:17.814
What's with you?

04:18.423 --> 04:20.415
Remember that next-door
neighbor of mine?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.823
The apartment
that always smells like potatoes?

04:22.996 --> 04:25.157
Your whole building
smells like potatoes.

04:25.331 --> 04:30.291
This jackass goes to Paris,
leaves her alarm on.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.539
It's been beeping since 3:30
this morning.

04:33.706 --> 04:38.166
You know, that happened to Lomez,
so he blew his neighbor's circuit.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.569
-How did he do that?
-Yeah, well, it's easy.

04:40.747 --> 04:44.205
Just let me finish this mile-high
and I'll be right with you.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.942
Oh, we're gonna need
a case of Kaiser Rolls.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.315
I think we might have one left
in the stockroom.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.757
This hallway smells like potatoes.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.227
-I know. I know. This is it.
-Okay.

04:59.399 --> 05:03.529
Oh, see, this socket, it's probably
connected to her apartment.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.196
So, what we'll do...

05:06.673 --> 05:08.163
...we'll take this paper clip...

05:08.341 --> 05:12.539
...and we'll bend it
so it'll short out the entire circuit.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.179
There you go.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.246
-I think I'll let you do it.
-No, no. It's easy.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.045
Just do it quickly.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.587
No, I really don't want to.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.086
Well, I don't want to either.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.522
-I thought you've done this before.
-Yeah, well, I have, it's just...

05:27.694 --> 05:29.594
...it's no picnic.

05:29.762 --> 05:32.128
-How are we gonna do it?
-All right, all right.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.391
Fine, fine. I'll do it.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.835
-Oh, mama.
-Are you okay?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.536
I'm gonna lose that nail.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.811
I enjoy the challenge of medicine.

05:52.985 --> 05:56.751
You'd have no idea what it's like to
have someone's life depend on you.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.515
Well, I have this neighbor.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.250
A joke.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.760
Do you have any idea what it
feels like to save someone's life?

06:04.931 --> 06:07.195
Is it anything
like hitting a homer in softball?

06:08.334 --> 06:11.929
-No.
-Because I hit a whomper last week.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.902
Here you go.
Airbrushed you into sand and sky.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.008
What did you do here?

06:22.482 --> 06:23.972
You took out the wrong guy.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.581
Thought you said
you wanted to be out.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.279
But I'm still here.
You took out the other guy.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.385
You've really lost a lot of hair.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.688
I am aware.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.563
<i>The world's best pizza-cutter.</i>

06:45.037 --> 06:46.470
<i>Seventy-six bucks.</i>

06:46.639 --> 06:48.630
<i>How often do I make--?</i>

06:49.842 --> 06:52.003
<i>I've gotta buy a book.</i>

06:56.749 --> 06:58.614
The cat.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.184
He took out Kruger?

07:02.355 --> 07:05.756
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize
it's gone until this guy can fix it.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.153
Slicer is indomitable.

07:08.327 --> 07:09.817
Where'd you get that coat?

07:09.996 --> 07:12.590
You buy enough meat,
they'll give you anything.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.657
Kramer?

07:15.067 --> 07:16.728
My neighbor has a cat.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.997
When we blew the power, we must
have shut off the automatic feeder.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.698
See, that's the same thing
that happened to Lomez.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.870
What did he do about it?

07:25.044 --> 07:29.174
Well, he moved into a motel
and the cat eventually died.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.112
Well, this meowing
is absolutely worse than the alarm.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.686
Oh, well, that's a prickly one.

07:36.823 --> 07:40.122
-How was the doctor date?
-It died on the table.

07:40.927 --> 07:44.454
She spent an hour and a half
making me feel like I'm worthless.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.427
Well, you know, she's very focused.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.861
Dermatology is her life.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.833
Dermatology?

07:52.004 --> 07:54.131
Yes. She's a dermatologist.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.934
Saving lives?

07:56.108 --> 07:59.839
The whole profession is,
"Just put some aloe on it."

08:00.313 --> 08:02.508
The slicer. Elaine. Let's go.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.309
-Where are we going?
-The cat.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.146
Just grab that meat and let's ride.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.216
When are you going
on your next date?

08:11.390 --> 08:12.880
Oh, what's the point?

08:13.059 --> 08:14.822
You're gonna pass up
an opportunity...

08:14.994 --> 08:17.326
...to put that aloe-pusher
in her place?

08:17.864 --> 08:19.058
A revenge date?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.200
That sounds more like you than me.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.568
This could be so sweet, Jerry.
Saving lives?

08:24.737 --> 08:28.002
She's one step above working
at the Clinique counter.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.277
Dermatologists.
Skin doesn't need a doctor.

08:32.445 --> 08:36.279
Of course not.
Wash it, dry it, move on.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.283
You're right. I'm gonna call her up
and tell her off.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.443
Oh, no, no, no.
This has to be carefully orchestrated.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.681
You go to a fancy diner, flowers--

08:44.857 --> 08:48.190
-Flowers?
-Yeah. You gotta do it classy.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.053
So you've done this?

08:50.229 --> 08:51.992
Almost.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.263
Couldn't get the girl to go out
with me a second time.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.198
I think we're looking
at half a millimeter.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.107
Can it cut that thin?

09:04.277 --> 09:08.111
Oh, I've cut slices so thin
I couldn't even see them.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.673
How'd you know you cut it?

09:11.817 --> 09:14.752
Well, I guess, I just assumed.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.720
Don't worry, kitty.
Dinner's coming.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.451
Look at that, huh?
That's a hall of famer.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.095
-All right, let's do it.
-Yeah, all right, here we go.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.925
-Yeah, watch this baby slide.
-Okay.

09:27.099 --> 09:30.865
Come on, come on, go ahead.
Go, kitty. Go.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.972
Oh, my God, it worked. Wow.

09:35.141 --> 09:38.008
-Can I borrow that thing for a while?
-Oh, I don't think so.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.771
-Why not?
-Well, you're not checked out on it.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.106
What do I have to know?

09:42.281 --> 09:43.771
Well, where the meat goes.

09:43.950 --> 09:44.974
Right there?

09:45.151 --> 09:46.482
Where do you turn it on?

09:47.119 --> 09:48.108
Right there.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.312
But where does the meat go?

09:53.225 --> 09:56.456
The restaurant, flowers.
This is so nice.

09:56.629 --> 09:59.097
Well, I'm a classy guy.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.359
-How's the life-saving business?
-It's fine.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.869
It must take a really,
really big zit to kill a man.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.939
What is with you?

10:09.108 --> 10:13.044
You call yourself life saver.
I call you Pimple Popper, M.D.

10:13.212 --> 10:14.611
Dr. Sitarides?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.441
Mr. Parry, how are you?

10:16.616 --> 10:20.017
I just want to thank you again
for saving my life.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.619
She saved your life?

10:21.787 --> 10:25.245
-I had skin cancer.
-Skin cancer.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.948
Damn.

10:28.194 --> 10:32.062
You were right, Kramer,
this slicer is absolutely amazing.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.798
Yeah, Yeah.
No, no, no, I'll bring it by tonight.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.473
Okay. Bye.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.545
These heels are so uneven.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.808
Here you go, Mr. Costanza.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.985
What is this?

11:00.159 --> 11:02.093
This is a drawing?

11:02.561 --> 11:04.256
It looks real, doesn't it?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.988
This is a cartoon.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.929
Hey. I had to draw that guy
from memory.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.729
Considering,
I think that's damn good.

11:11.904 --> 11:15.101
But it's not a photograph.
I need a photograph.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.504
Then you better get a camera.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.712
He looks like a Peanuts' character.

11:25.885 --> 11:30.185
I know. The only way to fix it now
is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.290
-You could do that.
-Without his shirt on?

11:32.458 --> 11:34.358
You can't do that.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.393
Well, maybe Kruger
wasn't the place for you.

11:37.563 --> 11:40.464
-They seemed so disorganized.
-I understand.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.193
What about the Coast Guard?

11:43.402 --> 11:45.893
Seems like a lot of pride there.
A lot of tradition.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.266
True.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.805
You mean for you?

11:50.376 --> 11:53.470
-You think?
-What about your sea sickness?

11:54.146 --> 11:56.580
Maybe I could be a land guy.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.409
I don't know if they have land guys.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.917
Someone's gotta unhook the boat
before it leaves the place.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.949
-Pliers?
-Drawer.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.992
-Got it.
-What are they for?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.097
I got a piece of my heel
stuck in the slicer.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.860
-Come again?
-Okay. I got a little slicer happy.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.526
But don't tell Kramer, okay?

12:18.704 --> 12:22.003
He has very strong feelings for it.

12:22.174 --> 12:25.302
I almost forgot to ask you.
How did the revenge date go?

12:26.045 --> 12:27.171
It went okay.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.280
Did you dress nice?
Did you do it classy?

12:29.448 --> 12:30.915
Yeah, I started out real classy.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.608
Yeah, you did. You classed it up.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.277
But then I found out
about the skin cancer.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.753
-Oh, so it backfired?
-Yes.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.925
So I guess I'm lucky
I never tried that myself.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.962
Of course she treats skin cancer.
That's how I met her.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.430
She was doing a skin-cancer
screening at Peterman.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.967
This is what dermatologists do.

12:51.137 --> 12:54.629
Sadly, that knowledge
could have helped me.

12:55.641 --> 12:59.304
Wait a second. She did a
skin-cancer screening at Peterman?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.878
Could she do that at Kruger?
I don't know. I guess.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.175
So I set up a screening,
everyone takes their shirt off...

13:05.351 --> 13:08.980
...and click, I snap me a shot
of a bare-chested Kruger.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.522
Do you got a little thing
for this fella?

13:13.192 --> 13:15.319
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.327
Yesterday you told me
I had to take my revenge on her.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.124
And that was wrong, Jerry.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.833
You simply must apologize.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.128
-Must l?
-Yes.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.999
Because it is the mature,
adult thing to do.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.141
How does that affect me?

13:31.076 --> 13:33.977
Elaine. All right,
where's the SP 2000?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.171
Because I gotta slice.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.149
I forgot it. I gotta get home.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.809
Oh, okay. Well, I'll go with you.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.682
I'm not really going straight home.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.825
I have to first stop off at the...

13:47.626 --> 13:49.491
...circus.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.564
You know, with all the clowns.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.561
All right, you have fun.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.498
Oh, no clowns. I don't like clowns.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.729
The clowns.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.740
So again, I'm sorry.
I had no right to yell at you.

14:07.913 --> 14:11.178
You're a life-saving doctor
and I'm just a comedian.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.910
Jerry, enough. I'll do your
friend's cancer screening...

14:14.086 --> 14:18.045
...because I believe in that, but as far
as you and I are concerned, it's off.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.714
Was it Pimple Popper, M.D.?

14:20.326 --> 14:22.226
That's the one.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.392
Still got it.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.698
Out, damn heel.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.433
-Elaine?
-Kramer?

14:34.607 --> 14:37.075
Yeah, listen, I need my slicer back.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.869
Just hold on.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.312
-Hey, what's going on?
-Nothing.

14:46.518 --> 14:47.951
Here. Here you go.

14:48.954 --> 14:52.253
Okay. I'm on the phone, all right?
I'm on the phone with someone.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.227
My blade is all dinged up.
Oh, come on.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.422
-Elaine.
-Phone call.

15:00.599 --> 15:04.501
-I'm on a big phone call.
-Oh, come on. This is important.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.130
Hey. Get the hell out of here.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.969
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.804
So, George took
my slicer down to Kruger...

15:14.980 --> 15:17.210
...and they're
smoothing it out for me.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.948
What the hell is this?

15:19.718 --> 15:22.949
Boy, that looks like
an allergic reaction.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.613
Have you been
wearing a fake beard?

15:26.292 --> 15:28.419
-No.
-Well, what have you been doing?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.425
Nothing. I got up,
I ran some errands...

15:30.596 --> 15:32.120
...went to Sara and apologized--

15:32.298 --> 15:34.960
Whoa, back up. Dr. Sitarides?
Yeah, what happened there?

15:35.134 --> 15:37.864
Well, I tried to apologize.
It didn't go over too well.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.095
There's your hives.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.205
What? She gave me hives?

15:41.373 --> 15:46.640
Jerry, as the Bible says,
"Thou who cureth can maketh ill."

15:47.413 --> 15:49.142
She did kind of touch my face.

15:49.315 --> 15:50.873
Listen to me. Find this woman...

15:51.050 --> 15:53.177
...tell her you're not
a test-tube pincushion.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.482
It does itch. Maybe I will go down
to Kruger and talk to her.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.386
All right, great. I gotta go
there and pick up my blade.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.959
Oh, hey, and I couldn't find
that stockroom.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.100
Oh, that's fantastic.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.681
I just talked to Mr. Kruger.
He'll be down in a minute.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.010
He wanted me to take a photograph.

16:26.185 --> 16:30.019
-What record?
-His personal file. I don't ask.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.514
Jerry, what brings you here?

16:32.691 --> 16:34.818
I don't know. This?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.359
Looks like hives.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.154
Where do you think
that came from?

16:38.330 --> 16:40.730
-What're you doing?
-Setting the record straight.

16:40.899 --> 16:42.366
Come on, Sitarides. Cop to it.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.934
What brand of perverted science
do you practice?

16:45.104 --> 16:48.198
Are you suggesting I somehow
infected you on purpose?

16:48.374 --> 16:50.205
I want the antidote, Pimple Popper.

16:50.376 --> 16:53.311
That's it. I'm out of here.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.208
You're insane.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.507
Am l?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.150
You touched my face.
I didn't imagine that.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.582
Dr. Sitarides. Don't go.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.222
Thanks, Jerry.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.320
Hey, George. Hey, doc.

17:06.492 --> 17:08.550
We doing screening in here?

17:09.862 --> 17:13.491
Yeah, why don't you head on in.
We'll be in a second.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.964
Be right with you.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.970
-Doc?
-Oh, Kramer, this is perfect.

17:19.137 --> 17:22.300
Go in there, pretend you're a doctor
and check this guy for moles.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.135
Moles. Yes.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.936
Freckle's ugly cousin.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.615
And just get a picture
of him with his shirt off.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.041
You're really cooking up
a Ischeme here.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.381
All right. Come on, let's get in there.
Quick, quick, quick.

17:42.194 --> 17:45.561
That is it.
I can't take this anymore.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.705
Male mammal.

17:58.877 --> 18:03.143
Approximately 30 to 60
years of age.

18:03.315 --> 18:07.547
Weight, oh, indeterminate.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.785
Okay, Mr. Kruger...

18:09.955 --> 18:11.946
...we'll take a photo for the records...

18:12.124 --> 18:14.285
...so if you'll stand up please.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.257
Give me a big smile.

18:16.728 --> 18:19.196
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that big.

18:19.364 --> 18:22.356
Yeah, that's nice.
Yes. Okay.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.729
Yes, let's have a look-see?

18:24.903 --> 18:27.098
Okay, so...

18:27.873 --> 18:31.832
...fiber from shirt on left shoulder.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.009
I'll have to keep my eye on that.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.615
How long have you been doing this,
Dr. Van Nostrand?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.274
Oh, a long, long time.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.650
Yes, I've seen moles so big
they have their own moles.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.587
Freckles that cover two men.

18:47.926 --> 18:51.327
-So how am I looking?
-Oh, so far, so good.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.699
-Kramer, I really owe you.
-George, we got a problem.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.871
What?
-Well, he's got a mole...

19:05.043 --> 19:07.204
...on his shoulder, very suspicious.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.007
Tell him you're concerned
and he should see someone else.

19:10.449 --> 19:14.044
George, why would l,
a Julliard-trained dermatologist...

19:14.219 --> 19:16.050
...send him to another doctor?

19:16.221 --> 19:18.587
Because you're not a dermatologist.

19:18.757 --> 19:21.419
Oh, but he thinks I am
and I won't betray that trust.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.289
Now, here's what I wanna do.
I think I can get a section...

19:24.463 --> 19:26.363
-...then I'll go down--
-Whoa, a section?

19:26.532 --> 19:28.762
If I can grab my slicer
and if he holds still.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.630
No. You're not taking
a deli slicer to my boss.

19:31.803 --> 19:35.398
-It'll be ultrathin. He'll barely feel it.
-No. Absolutely not.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.569
It's my medical opinion
that you're making a big mistake...

19:40.746 --> 19:43.237
...and it's going in my chart.

19:48.153 --> 19:51.680
Yeah, hello,
is this Allied Locksmith?

19:51.857 --> 19:55.349
Finally. Okay, I need somebody
to come over here right away.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.223
Turn that off. Turn it off!

19:58.397 --> 20:02.891
I am getting a locksmith.
All right. Relax!

20:03.068 --> 20:04.899
All right. That's it.

20:05.070 --> 20:08.972
Yeah, the address is 78 West--

20:09.141 --> 20:11.871
-Oh, mama.
-Hello?

20:13.579 --> 20:14.876
So, Kramer pulled it off?

20:15.047 --> 20:18.744
Yep. And the photo is all fixed and
back on his desk, no thanks to you.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.215
That woman had it coming to her.
Look at my neck.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.081
I look like I had a beard of bees.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.689
-You should see somebody.
-I called everyone.

20:25.857 --> 20:29.315
You know how hard it is to get
a dermatologist in this town?

20:29.494 --> 20:32.793
A real dermatologist?

20:32.965 --> 20:34.933
Squamous cell carcinoma.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.568
You're not a doctor.
You shouldn't have books like this.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.466
That's what he has, I gotta call.
We gotta come clean.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.937
You can't tell him.
You'll blow the whole thing.

20:43.108 --> 20:47.044
-I don't want this on my conscience.
-I will get him to see a real doctor.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.442
-You just stay away from him.
-All right.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.981
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture
of my rash in here.

20:53.218 --> 20:57.518
Yeah, they got everything, Jerry.
I underlined the best parts.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.690
Hey, this looks like what I have.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.290
Caused by exposure to benzene...

21:03.462 --> 21:06.863
...a common ingredient
in metal cleaners.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.260
Well, that's weird.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.768
What are you doing?

21:12.504 --> 21:14.096
Well, I'm, cleaning my slicer.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.968
That's my hand towel.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.371
I use that on my face,
neck and chest.

21:18.543 --> 21:21.603
That's where the hives are coming
from. It's not Dr. Sitarides.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.214
It was Dr. Van Nostrand.

21:24.383 --> 21:28.444
So somehow the Bronze-O is reacting
to the poison she's giving you.

21:29.254 --> 21:30.653
All right, get out.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.952
And take your Bronze-O with you.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.151
Whoa, that's toxic.

21:41.233 --> 21:42.666
George, come on in.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.829
I'm just going over our annual report.

21:46.004 --> 21:48.199
Boy, did we take it on the chin
last year.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.469
Mr. Kruger, I got a
message from Dr. Van Nostrand.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.842
He says, it might be wise for you
to see another doctor about that mole.

21:57.015 --> 21:58.676
I'm not too worried about it.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.876
He said it could be cancerous,
you should have it checked out.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.521
George...

22:03.689 --> 22:06.021
...take a look at this photo.

22:06.758 --> 22:08.919
This was taken 10 years ago.

22:09.094 --> 22:12.188
Now, that mole looks
exactly as it does today.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.129
So there's no cause
for concern, huh?

22:18.637 --> 22:20.332
Whatever.

22:20.539 --> 22:22.131
And actually...

22:22.441 --> 22:24.534
...funny thing about this photo.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.371
We were at the beach...

22:26.545 --> 22:28.809
...and there was this dumb-looking
guy nearby.

22:28.980 --> 22:32.882
When he went in for a swim,
my sons and I took all his stuff...

22:33.051 --> 22:35.042
...threw it in the ocean, huh?

22:35.220 --> 22:37.780
What a pear-shaped loser.

22:39.324 --> 22:42.157
Well, that pear-shaped loser
was me.

22:42.327 --> 22:44.659
And I was in that photo
until I broke in here...

22:44.830 --> 22:48.061
...stole the photograph
and airbrushed myself out of it.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.064
Well, I'll be.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.863
You have lost a lot of hair.

22:53.805 --> 22:55.966
That's what they tell me.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.514
So you want more pastrami?

23:05.684 --> 23:08.278
What was that last thing?
That was pretty good.

23:08.453 --> 23:10.080
-Yeah, it was olive loaf.
-Oh.

23:10.255 --> 23:11.381
-You want that?
-Yeah.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.115
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you
after all that.

23:14.292 --> 23:18.228
He said he didn't care.
God, I love that place.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.830
You see another dermatologist?

23:19.998 --> 23:21.966
Yeah, I finally got in to see
Dr. Kazarian.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.294
He said it was bad.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.096
-What'd he give you for it?
-Aloe.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.132
So where's that locksmith?

23:28.306 --> 23:30.467
Tough to get him out at this hour.

23:30.642 --> 23:34.373
-Can I have a sip?
-Oh, yeah, coming up.
