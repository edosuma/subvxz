01:34.260 --> 01:35.796
Cousin, I’m home!

01:38.532 --> 01:40.767
(Larry)
’Push your fingers together.’

01:44.404 --> 01:45.672
Thank you, cousin.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.157
I have never been so proud.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.660
You’ve enlisted.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.832
Balki, I haven’t enlisted.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.949
Balki, this is hunting gear.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.752
Tomorrow, I am going
hunting with Wainwright.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.387
Hunting? Cousin,
I didn’t know you were a hunter.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.857
I’m not. I’ve never been
hunting before in my life.

02:37.924 --> 02:40.727
But how hard could it be?

02:40.761 --> 02:43.229
You point the gun, you pull
the trigger, you hit something.

02:48.869 --> 02:49.970
Now, wait a minute.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.705
Cousin, you know
I don’t approve of

02:51.738 --> 02:53.574
the hunting of innocent animals.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.276
Balki, it’s a sport.

02:56.309 --> 02:59.212
It’s only a sport
if the animals have guns, too.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.384
But you’re big enough to make
your own bad decisions.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.252
Thank you.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.989
Just for the record

03:09.022 --> 03:11.792
what poor, wide‐eyed,
innocent creature

03:11.825 --> 03:14.294
who never meant you
any harm in the world

03:14.327 --> 03:17.531
and whose very existence
supports the delicate balance

03:17.564 --> 03:20.300
of nature will you
be mindlessly slaughtering?

03:25.338 --> 03:26.372
Ducks.

03:32.979 --> 03:33.980
Ducks?

03:37.651 --> 03:40.554
Yes...ducks.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.328
Filthy, disgusting

03:48.361 --> 03:50.797
immoral ducks?

03:54.635 --> 03:57.804
Well...ducks.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.609
I hate ducks.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.447
Ducks have terrorized
generations of Mypiots.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.551
Cousin, they ruin our crops

04:10.584 --> 04:13.620
foul our wells,
and date our chickens.

04:19.892 --> 04:23.329
We tried, cousin, we tried to
live peacefully with the ducks.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.800
We, we talked to them,
we negotiated with them.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.836
We threatened, we even set out
a tangy orange sauce

04:29.870 --> 04:31.838
to let them know
we meant business.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.641
But nothing worked.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.877
In the end we had no choice

04:36.910 --> 04:38.712
but to do battle
with the ducks.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.947
Oh, cousin,
let me go with you. Let me...

04:40.981 --> 04:43.950
Let me hunt, let me hunt
these dreadful creatures

04:43.984 --> 04:46.352
and eradicate them
from the face of the earth!

04:46.386 --> 04:50.090
Filthy, disgusting,
immoral ducks!

04:50.123 --> 04:51.892
[groans]

04:52.826 --> 04:54.327
Oh!

04:54.360 --> 04:55.862
[groaning]

05:04.137 --> 05:05.772
Balki!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.741
Snap out of it!

05:09.075 --> 05:10.977
I’m fine.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.079
Cousin, you’ve got to
take me with you.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.247
You must let me hunt the ducks!
Cousin, I’ve got to‐‐

05:14.280 --> 05:17.350
No, Balki. Balki, Balki,
listen to me. No way. No way.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.120
I am not letting you get
anywhere near those ducks.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.354
Oh, no.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.359
Filthy, disgusting,
immoral ducks!

05:26.392 --> 05:29.362
[groaning]

05:38.171 --> 05:39.873
[sobbing]

05:43.176 --> 05:44.611
Balki!

05:44.645 --> 05:45.946
Snap out of it!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.081
I’m fine.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.151
Alright.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.786
Balki...

05:53.954 --> 05:55.622
What is wrong with you?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.859
Cousin, there’s something
about me that...

05:58.892 --> 06:00.894
...that I’ve never told you.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.833
I don’t wanna know.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.005
Well, you’ve gotta know.

06:12.038 --> 06:16.743
When I was a little boy, I‐I
found this little baby turtle.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.879
He had, he had hurt
his little leg

06:18.912 --> 06:20.981
and his mama leave him behind.

06:21.014 --> 06:24.985
So I took him home,
and I nurse him back to health.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.987
I named him Bippi.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.422
Oh, Bippi.

06:31.457 --> 06:36.196
One day, Bippi and I were laying
out in a field getting some sun

06:36.229 --> 06:39.099
and all of a sudden,
out of nowhere

06:39.132 --> 06:43.436
a duck swoop out of the sky
and grab Bippi and fly away.

06:43.469 --> 06:46.907
And I‐I run after them,
stumbling and calling...

06:46.940 --> 06:50.544
"Bippi! Bippi! Bippi!"

06:50.577 --> 06:54.681
And‐and Bippi looked‐looked down
longingly at me and cried out...

07:02.589 --> 07:04.558
Cousin...

07:04.591 --> 07:07.528
...let me go with you
and hunt the enemy duck.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.597
Let me do it for Bippi!

07:15.201 --> 07:16.436
Balki...

07:18.204 --> 07:20.607
I’m sorry about...

07:22.275 --> 07:23.610
...Bippi.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.711
[sobbing]

07:27.013 --> 07:28.148
But I can’t let you go.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.852
Cousin, but I was, I was
the best duck hunter on Mypos.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.855
They have shotguns on Mypos?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.758
Well, of course we do!
Don’t be ridiculous!

07:38.992 --> 07:40.927
How else you think
we make Swiss cheese?

07:44.297 --> 07:47.601
But to hunt the dreaded duck

07:47.634 --> 07:49.603
we needed a more accurate
weapon...

07:49.636 --> 07:51.772
...a more deadly weapon.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.775
So we developed
the ultimate weapon.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.512
I brought one with me,
just in case.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.782
The ducks have been
known to migrate.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.250
Cousin, wait ’til you see this.
You’re going to want one.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.220
Balki, I don’t want to see
the ultimate weapon.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.723
This trip is
very important to me.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.257
You can’t come.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.938
Here it is.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.073
The deadly, bonk‐a‐duck!

08:31.077 --> 08:33.813
[ululating]

08:37.583 --> 08:39.919
Pretty impressive, huh?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.988
Balki, that is just
a sling with a rock.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.323
You can’t hit anything
with that.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.158
[scoffs]

08:48.361 --> 08:50.531
That’s what that duck said.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.606
Now...

08:59.640 --> 09:02.008
...you see that soda can
sitting on that bus bench

09:02.042 --> 09:03.910
about fifty yards away?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.311
Yes, I see it.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.013
Do you expect me to believe
that you are going to hit

09:07.047 --> 09:09.349
that can with a rock
in this silly sling?

09:09.382 --> 09:12.085
No, Mr. Ye‐of‐Little‐Faith.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.958
I expect you to believe that
I’m going to hit that soda can

09:17.991 --> 09:21.595
make it spin in the air,
bounce off that tree

09:21.628 --> 09:23.129
and land in the trash can.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.732
Balki, have you
been doing cartwheels

09:25.766 --> 09:27.067
without your arms again?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.572
Stand over there.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.118
[ululating]

09:46.052 --> 09:47.220
[can clanking]

09:47.253 --> 09:49.089
Oh, my lord! You hit it!

09:49.122 --> 09:50.356
‐And?
‐It’s spinning in the air!

09:50.390 --> 09:51.692
‐And?
‐Bouncing off the tree!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.660
‐Into?
‐A trash can.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.830
Need I say less?

09:58.398 --> 10:01.367
Balki, you are coming
with me on this trip.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.404
After this weekend, I’ll be
Wainwright’s favorite employee.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.740
I’ll get a raise!
I’ll get a promotion!

10:06.773 --> 10:09.242
And I’ll get a handsome
duck head for the mantel.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.677
[inhales deeply]

10:13.046 --> 10:14.314
[instrumental music]

10:24.124 --> 10:26.927
Balki! Over here!

10:26.960 --> 10:28.895
This spot is perfect.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.305
[imitates gunshot]

10:53.854 --> 10:58.291
[sighs]
I love the smell of stagnant
swamp water in the morning.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.194
Reminds me of Mypos.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.668
Yo, ducks!
I’m your worst nightmare!

11:09.202 --> 11:13.106
A Mypiot with a fully‐loaded
over‐shoulder boulder‐holder!

11:16.442 --> 11:18.044
Balki...

11:18.078 --> 11:19.245
...is this good duck weather?

11:19.279 --> 11:21.782
Oh, this is great duck weather.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.784
The sky was just like
this the last time

11:23.817 --> 11:25.786
the ducks invaded Mypos.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.854
There were hundreds of them.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.890
They came in low,
from the north.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.325
They got in right under Radaros.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.494
‐You mean Radar?
‐No, I mean Radaros.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.897
He’s a little guy
with baggy pants

11:36.930 --> 11:39.099
who sits in a tree...

11:39.132 --> 11:41.735
...and looks up into
the sky for ducks.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.237
On the weekends, he’s a
wind sock at the airport.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.940
Reconnaissance ducks!

11:46.973 --> 11:48.174
[ululating]

11:48.208 --> 11:50.476
No ducks! No ducks! No ducks.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.379
Would you hold it
down over here?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.081
Mister... Y‐yes, sir.
Uh, sorry, uh...

11:55.115 --> 11:58.151
Uh, Balki stepped on a...fish.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.820
I’m counting on you two.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.222
The pride of "The Chronicle"
is in our hands.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.957
You have nothing
to worry about, sir.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.092
Mr. Wainwright, if you can

12:06.126 --> 12:09.395
try to take a few of the ducks
alive, we can interrogate them.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.833
It’s j‐just a little
duck humor, sir.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.069
Remember, kill as many
ducks as you can.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.038
We’re here to have fun.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.511
Balki, what if
no ducks fly over?

12:24.545 --> 12:26.012
Don’t worry, cousin.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.048
I have this.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.983
I can call them.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.018
[duck call]

12:36.222 --> 12:37.490
I speak fluent Duck.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.862
I know how to lure them, cousin.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.230
It’s an old,
but effective trick.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.266
I’ll do the duck mating call.

12:48.569 --> 12:50.971
[duck call]

13:07.387 --> 13:09.289
Now remember, cousin...

13:09.322 --> 13:11.324
They’ll be in a mating mood.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.795
So whatever you do,
don’t make eye contact.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.402
‐Balki.
‐What?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.170
It worked. I see ducks.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.371
‐Where?
‐Off in the distance.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.440
(Larry)
’I‐I think they’re
headed this way!’

13:27.473 --> 13:29.876
I hope I see the one
who got Bippi!

13:29.910 --> 13:32.412
[ululating]

13:32.445 --> 13:33.914
They’re getting closer!

13:34.648 --> 13:36.449
Wait a minute! No, cousin!

13:36.482 --> 13:37.551
[gunshot]

13:39.620 --> 13:41.321
Well, what did you
do that for?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.389
Well, I cannot let you
kill them ducks!

13:44.891 --> 13:46.326
[instrumental music]

13:50.463 --> 13:51.898
[instrumental music]

13:55.969 --> 13:57.971
What are you doing?
What is the matter with you?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.405
Cousin, we cannot
kill them ducks.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.542
What do you mean,
we cannot kill them ducks?

14:01.575 --> 14:02.475
You hate ducks.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.411
Well, I don’t hate
little fluffy ducks.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.981
Them ducks aren’t
Myposian killer ducks.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.550
Ducks is ducks.

14:12.586 --> 14:13.554
You idiot.

14:13.587 --> 14:16.189
You shot too soon,
and scared the ducks away.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.592
I‐I, Mr. Wainwright, it was
my fault, I told him not to‐‐

14:18.625 --> 14:19.960
[grunts]

14:19.993 --> 14:20.927
He was covering for me, sir.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.530
He’s the best cousin
you could ask for.

14:23.564 --> 14:24.464
It won’t happen again, sir.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.433
If we go home losers
I’ll be unhappy...

14:27.467 --> 14:29.469
...and then you’ll be unhappy.

14:31.672 --> 14:34.641
Did I tell you how dashing you
look in your hunting gear, sir?

14:36.610 --> 14:39.379
Balki, we have
to kill those ducks.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.047
Now, those ducks
are the same kind of ducks

14:41.081 --> 14:43.584
that swept out of the sky
and grabbed little Bippi.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.587
Poor, helpless, defenseless,
little Bippi...

14:46.620 --> 14:48.622
...whose life became
an empty shell.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.928
Nice imagery, cousin,
but I’m not buying it.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.463
Them ducks is just
little fluffy ducks.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.166
Little fluffy ducks cannot
pick up a 300‐pound

15:00.200 --> 15:02.202
sea turtle and fly away.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.310
Bippi was a 300‐pound turtle?

15:11.612 --> 15:13.446
When I watched his diet, yeah.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.150
And a duck carried him away?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.221
What do these ducks look like?

15:23.256 --> 15:25.559
Oh, cousin, they are terrifying.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.029
They have a six foot wingspan.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.264
And their skin is this

15:31.297 --> 15:34.100
leathery armor‐like material.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.337
They have razor‐sharp claws

15:37.370 --> 15:40.306
and long ferocious beaks.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.476
And the backs of their
heads come to a point...

15:43.510 --> 15:46.179
...although they do have
a rather disarming smile.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.987
Balki, you just described
a pterodactyl.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.723
No, pteroductyl.

15:56.757 --> 15:59.593
You say pterodactyl,
we say pteroductyl.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.728
You say to‐may‐to,
we say to‐mah‐to.

16:01.762 --> 16:04.197
My point is, let’s call
the whole thing off.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.331
[mumbles]

16:05.365 --> 16:06.667
No, Balki, Balki, Balki, Balki.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.102
Believe me, if these
were little fluffy ducks

16:09.135 --> 16:10.771
I’d be the first one to say
we can’t kill them.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.540
But those ducks
were pteroductyls.

16:13.574 --> 16:15.475
They were just too far away
for you to recognize them.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.277
So call ’em back,
call ’em back

16:17.310 --> 16:19.580
and knock as many of them
as you can out of the sky

16:19.613 --> 16:22.015
and you’ll see them
for the killer ducks

16:22.048 --> 16:24.017
that they really are.

16:24.050 --> 16:27.253
Boy, do we hate ducks!

16:27.287 --> 16:29.455
Ducks, ducks, filthy

16:29.489 --> 16:33.259
disgusting, immoral ducks!

16:33.293 --> 16:35.461
[groaning]

16:41.234 --> 16:43.504
You know, you’re three floats
short of a parade?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.574
Alright, alright, Balki.

16:47.608 --> 16:49.342
Maybe these aren’t
killer ducks.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.344
But I have the opportunity
of a lifetime here.

16:52.613 --> 16:55.048
We are talking about my future.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.484
On the way here,
Mr. Wainwright called me Barry.

17:00.821 --> 17:03.323
Do you realize how close that
is to my real first name?

17:04.790 --> 17:07.828
Balki, if we can knock just
a few ducks out of the sky

17:07.861 --> 17:11.263
my career will take off!
Please, please, please!

17:11.297 --> 17:13.165
Please, come on,
please, Balki, please.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.335
Balki, Balki, Balki...

17:15.367 --> 17:17.337
[duck call]

17:19.772 --> 17:20.607
You’re calling the ducks!
Thank you! Thank you!

17:20.641 --> 17:24.210
No, I’m not.
Cousin, listen to me.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.310
I’m not calling the ducks.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.547
I’m calling to them to tell them

17:26.579 --> 17:29.249
that there’s danger here,
and they should not come back.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.219
Now, we’re going to just
sit down right here

17:33.253 --> 17:37.257
until Mr. Wainwright,
publisher and duck murderer

17:37.290 --> 17:39.292
decides it’s time to go home.

17:41.427 --> 17:42.663
[instrumental music]

17:47.734 --> 17:49.770
Balki, nobody has shot
a duck all day.

17:49.803 --> 17:52.639
If I can get just one duck,
"The Chronicle" will win

17:52.673 --> 17:54.107
and Wainwright will love us.
Call a duck.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.709
‐No. No.
‐Just one duck.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.678
One duck that none
of the other ducks like!

18:00.213 --> 18:01.447
Forget it, cousin.

18:02.348 --> 18:05.218
Ooh, oh, boy!

18:05.251 --> 18:07.821
Hey, this little bugger’s
really putting up a fight.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.090
But he’s no match for me.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.662
Yeah, yeah, I think
this baby’s a keeper.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.166
Cousin, you know this‐this...
Ah!

18:20.200 --> 18:22.603
This marsh is teeming
with Myposian delicacies.

18:22.636 --> 18:26.807
Look, I’ve got snails,
slugs and grubs.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.710
When we get home I’m gonna make
a nice three larvae salad.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.815
Little raspberry
vinaigrette dressing.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.252
[ducks quacking]

18:39.285 --> 18:40.554
Ducks!

18:40.587 --> 18:42.823
Who needs you? Ha ha ha!

18:42.856 --> 18:46.326
If I get lucky here,
my whole life changes forever.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.562
[duck call]

18:56.202 --> 18:58.772
‐You did that?
‐That’s right, I did.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.507
[duck call]

19:09.516 --> 19:11.518
[grunting]

19:17.824 --> 19:20.727
[duck call]

19:22.663 --> 19:23.730
[Larry groans]

19:23.764 --> 19:24.865
[duck call]

19:24.898 --> 19:25.932
[groaning]

19:25.966 --> 19:27.233
[duck call]

19:27.267 --> 19:28.502
[grunting]

19:37.243 --> 19:38.812
Ha ha ha!

19:38.845 --> 19:41.748
Now the duck call is under water
and you’ll never get it!

19:41.782 --> 19:44.618
Balki, the duck call is made
out of wood, it floats...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.287
Here it is.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.557
[duck call]

19:52.959 --> 19:54.895
There! I’ve called them. Ha!

19:54.928 --> 19:56.863
[laughs]

19:58.464 --> 19:59.533
What are you laughing at?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.667
You just told the ducks

20:00.701 --> 20:02.669
to migrate to Disney World.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.940
[duck call]

20:10.977 --> 20:12.846
[chuckles]

20:12.879 --> 20:14.681
You just told the ducks
never to come back

20:14.715 --> 20:16.550
because this marsh
is going condo.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.420
[duck call]

20:21.755 --> 20:23.423
[chuckles]
You lost them, cousin.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.758
Now you’re speaking in goose.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.395
[duck call]

20:29.429 --> 20:30.931
‐A‐ha!
‐Oh, no, no!

20:30.964 --> 20:32.899
No! No! No!

20:36.970 --> 20:38.772
Ha! There they come!

20:38.805 --> 20:40.541
[ducks quacking]

20:40.574 --> 20:42.543
Cousin, no! No, I cannot
let you do this!

20:42.576 --> 20:44.878
You can’t stop me!

20:44.911 --> 20:46.847
[laughs]

20:46.880 --> 20:48.515
Balki! Stop it!

20:48.549 --> 20:51.518
This is dangerous!
Someone could get hurt!

20:51.552 --> 20:55.055
Now, leave me alone!
I know what I’m doing!

20:55.088 --> 20:56.322
[gunshot]

20:56.356 --> 20:57.758
[man screaming]

20:58.725 --> 21:01.394
Oh, my lord!

21:01.427 --> 21:03.730
(Mr. Wainright)
’Appleton, you idiot!’

21:06.600 --> 21:08.535
I just shot my boss in the butt.

21:10.904 --> 21:12.639
[instrumental music]

21:18.645 --> 21:22.649
So, you had the opportunity
of a lifetime

21:22.683 --> 21:25.018
and you shot your boss.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.287
Good career move, Appleton.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.824
I would’ve been
at "The Chronicle"

21:30.857 --> 21:33.894
three years next month.

21:33.927 --> 21:35.896
This is the saddest day
of my life.

21:37.531 --> 21:39.766
I’m really gonna miss you.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.768
Are you gonna take
this stapler?

21:43.770 --> 21:46.540
‐You can have it.
‐Alright, thanks.

21:46.573 --> 21:49.876
I’m gonna turn around now,
Appleton. Don’t shoot.

21:49.910 --> 21:50.911
[laughs]

22:02.055 --> 22:04.991
Appleton, I’ve reconsidered.

22:05.025 --> 22:06.359
You’re not fired.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.828
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

22:07.861 --> 22:10.697
I‐I knew you’d realize that
I was a valuable employee

22:10.731 --> 22:13.466
and‐and that I‐I make a valuable
contribution to "The Chronicle"

22:13.499 --> 22:16.069
and‐and I knew you’d find it in
your heart to forgive me, sir.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.805
I’m not firing you
because the union won’t let me.

22:20.874 --> 22:22.809
That’s good enough for me, sir.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.779
Balki. Balki. Balki, good news.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.648
Wainwright was just here,
and‐and he left

22:27.681 --> 22:29.382
and‐and he said
he’s not gonna fire me.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.718
Well, that was quick.

22:31.752 --> 22:35.055
I just left a peace offering on
his desk not three minutes ago.

22:35.088 --> 22:36.456
What did you leave on his desk?

22:36.489 --> 22:38.091
A nice dish of three
larvae salad

22:38.124 --> 22:40.093
with a note saying
it was from you.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.030
Oh, my lord!

22:44.831 --> 22:47.100
[instrumental music]

22:55.041 --> 22:57.477
[theme music]
