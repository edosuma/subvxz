01:25.585 --> 01:28.036
"Senator Samuel Foley dead."

01:28.136 --> 01:29.745
Died here at Saint Vincent's.

01:29.856 --> 01:33.517
"At the bedside was political
sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."

01:33.626 --> 01:34.676
Long distance?

01:34.776 --> 01:38.263
Joseph Paine speaking. I want
the governor's residence, Jackson City.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.034
Oh, Joe!

01:43.069 --> 01:44.169
Oh, no!

01:44.270 --> 01:46.167
Couldn't have happened
at a worse time.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.806
Call Jim Taylor. Tell him
I'm flying home tonight.

01:49.642 --> 01:50.742
Right away.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.036
What is it?

01:52.145 --> 01:54.145
- Sam Foley's dead.
- Great saints!

01:54.247 --> 01:55.280
Of all times...

01:55.380 --> 01:57.645
...Foley had to go and die on us.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.283
Who are you calling?

01:59.385 --> 02:00.485
Taylor, my dear.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.204
What's up, Happy?

02:02.304 --> 02:03.980
Sam Foley died tonight.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.119
That's too bad.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.851
Well, don't get excited.
Is Paine coming?

02:10.463 --> 02:11.563
Yes, Jim.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.398
Yes, Jim.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.964
He'd drop dead
if you ever said no.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.668
My dear, this is no time for jokes.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.498
I've got to appoint a new senator.

02:21.054 --> 02:22.350
The governor will see all committees.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.833
The governor will see all committees.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.341
Tell him I won't wait any longer.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.909
Probably got Taylor in there,
telling him what to do.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.744
Tell them to wait.
I'll see them immediately.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.880
I can't put those howling citizens
off any longer.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.116
They'll want something to say about
who takes Foley's place.

02:40.226 --> 02:41.691
Ten to one they've got a man.

02:41.794 --> 02:42.918
Relax, Happy.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.391
Stop having kittens.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.065
Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine...

02:47.167 --> 02:49.531
...I'll give them one more minute
to make up their minds.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.260
You go tell Jim Taylor.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.631
I will tell him.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.865
It's high time I told Jim Taylor
a thing or two.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.713
If you and Joe gab any longer
about this appointment...

03:00.813 --> 03:02.141
...I'll see those committees.

03:02.248 --> 03:04.282
You'll see them when we're finished.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.179
But hurry, will you?

03:10.323 --> 03:13.017
That's telling him, Happy, old boy.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.360
Jim...

03:15.461 --> 03:18.359
...with this Willet Creek Dam
coming up...

03:18.464 --> 03:20.828
...the man who takes Foley's place...

03:20.934 --> 03:23.969
...can't ask any questions
or talk out of turn.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.831
We must be absolutely sure of him.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.563
That's why I say Horace Miller.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.503
He'll take orders all right.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.973
Suppose we don't try to go through
with this dam.

03:33.179 --> 03:36.180
Suppose we postpone it
until next session of Congress.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.382
Or drop it altogether.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.152
That'd be a crime, Joe.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.084
After all the work we put in on it?

03:43.389 --> 03:45.855
Burying it in this deficiency bill...

03:45.959 --> 03:47.788
...as nicely as you please.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.588
Having it approved.
It's rolling along.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.662
Like taking candy from a baby.

03:52.765 --> 03:56.323
Is it worth the risk of a scandal,
with a new man in the Senate?

03:56.436 --> 03:57.901
Worth the risk?

03:58.004 --> 04:00.163
What's the matter with you?

04:00.440 --> 04:03.236
Where you're concerned,
I wouldn't take the slightest risk...

04:03.343 --> 04:06.571
...especially with your great reputation
in the Senate.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.138
Here, look.

04:08.414 --> 04:12.109
Look at the campaign I started for you
in all my papers.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.746
A little obscure, isn't it?

04:14.854 --> 04:17.387
I don't know. Maybe.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.221
But after all, you're the logical man
from the West...

04:21.327 --> 04:23.190
...for the national ticket.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.626
At the convention, anything can happen.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.892
If what you say is possible...

04:29.002 --> 04:31.468
...why not do as I say
and drop things like this dam?

04:31.571 --> 04:33.696
We can't do it, Joe.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.668
We've been quietly buying all the land
around that dam...

04:37.777 --> 04:40.311
...and holding it in dummy names.

04:40.413 --> 04:44.108
If we drop it now,
it'll bring about an investigation.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.547
It'll show that we're going to sell it
to the state...

04:47.654 --> 04:49.915
...under phony names.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.988
The smartest thing for us to do...

04:52.091 --> 04:54.125
...is to push this dam through...

04:54.227 --> 04:55.919
...and get it over with.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.227
All right, appoint Miller.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.455
If you're sure he'll take orders.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.724
Don't worry.
He'll take orders.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.934
Come on.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.168
Just a minute.
Just one more minute!

05:07.273 --> 05:08.567
We've got your man.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.402
Horace Miller.

05:10.743 --> 05:11.827
A born stooge!

05:11.927 --> 05:14.309
Horace will perform like a trained seal.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.981
What did I tell you?

05:16.082 --> 05:18.377
If I throw a party man like Miller...

05:18.484 --> 05:20.984
For reasons I can't go into,
it's got to be him.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.849
Do you understand?
Now make out your ticket.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.080
Come on.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.657
But I've got to see those
angry committees first.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.952
Work for harmony.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.095
Harmony!

05:30.195 --> 05:33.529
In considering candidates who might have
the high qualifications...

05:33.633 --> 05:35.291
...of U.S. senator...

05:35.401 --> 05:38.334
...one name shone out like a beacon...

05:38.538 --> 05:41.038
...the Honorable Horace Miller.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.569
A party man.
He's Taylor's stooge!

05:44.677 --> 05:45.719
Please!

05:45.819 --> 05:48.609
New Citizens Committee
won't stand for this!

05:49.082 --> 05:51.878
So they named their own candidate, eh?

05:51.984 --> 05:53.084
Who?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.820
- You won't like him.
- Come on, who?

05:56.122 --> 05:57.780
Henry Hill.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.287
That crackpot?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.016
You should've killed that so fast...

06:01.127 --> 06:02.353
I couldn't.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.496
- Those men were...
- Never mind.

06:04.597 --> 06:05.891
You forget about them.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.328
That bunch is out for blood.
If l...

06:08.434 --> 06:09.660
I said forget about them.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.531
Horace Miller goes to the Senate,
and that settles it.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.567
I won't send Horace Miller.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.369
- You won't?
- No, I won't.

06:19.579 --> 06:23.137
I won't let you callously
wreck my whole political future.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.373
Your political future?

06:24.484 --> 06:26.518
I bought it for you as a present.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.381
I can grab it back so fast
it'll make your head swim.

06:29.489 --> 06:32.387
You've got a nerve to sit and worry
about your future...

06:32.492 --> 06:34.321
...when we're in a spot like this.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.017
The man is Miller.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.661
Hello, Dad.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.998
What's the matter?
Is it getting you down?

06:46.105 --> 06:47.297
Is what getting me down?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.134
You're in a deuce of a pickle.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.242
Looks like Henry Hill or else.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.378
It's Horace Miller or else.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.512
Peter!

06:54.612 --> 06:59.176
I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller,
Taylor or no Taylor.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.512
May I ask
what Taylor has to do with this?

07:01.621 --> 07:03.655
He's still running the show, ain't he?

07:03.756 --> 07:07.587
I won't have conversation of this sort
carried on at dinner.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.192
Why don't you listen to them
for a change?

07:09.695 --> 07:12.855
No doubt they can make
this appointment for me with ease.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.930
That's easy.
Jefferson Smith.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.931
I beg your pardon?

07:17.036 --> 07:18.501
He's the only senator to have.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.331
He ought to be President.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.973
I like Jeff Smith.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.808
You too?
Now everybody's been heard from.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.675
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know
him from a hole in the ground.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.851
- Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers!
- Oh, a boy?

07:32.952 --> 07:36.544
No, Dad. Jeff's a man.
Jeff Smith.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.020
Biggest expert we got in wild game...

07:39.158 --> 07:42.193
Right now he's the greatest hero
we ever had.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.794
It's all over the headlines.

07:43.896 --> 07:47.090
Didn't you see about the forest fire
all around Sweetwater?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.528
I did. What about it?

07:48.634 --> 07:51.362
- Jeff put that out himself.
- Himself?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.697
If you really want a senator...

07:52.805 --> 07:54.668
I do not want a senator.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.671
I do not want any more nonsense.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.537
He's the greatest American we got.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.110
He can tell you
what George Washington said, by heart.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.544
And Stuff has the swellest
stuff in it.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.841
What "stuff"?

08:04.951 --> 08:06.882
Boys' Stuff.
The name of Jeff's paper.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.111
He prints it. Look, here's one.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.687
Everybody reads it.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.552
All the kids in the state.
A million of them. Let me read...

08:13.659 --> 08:17.661
I'm in no mood
to listen to childish prattle.

08:17.763 --> 08:18.796
Prattle?

08:18.896 --> 08:19.930
You're all wet.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.463
You couldn't do better.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.430
- Better than what?
- Jeff for senator.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.864
Emma, if you please!

08:24.971 --> 08:26.436
Want to get out of a pickle, don't you?

08:26.539 --> 08:28.231
Always looking for votes, aren't you?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.568
Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each,
and they vote.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.299
If you want to do some good
in this state...

08:32.410 --> 08:34.479
If you're ever going to
stand up like a man...

08:34.580 --> 08:35.772
That settles it!

08:35.948 --> 08:39.279
I won't be belittled by my own children
in my own home.

08:39.385 --> 08:42.477
All my nerves are strained
to the breaking point!

08:42.822 --> 08:43.864
Henry Hill....

08:43.964 --> 08:45.252
Horace Miller....

08:45.358 --> 08:47.050
Miller? Hill?

08:47.159 --> 08:48.210
Hill?

08:48.310 --> 08:49.361
Miller?

08:51.397 --> 08:52.862
Heads, Hill.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.689
Tails, Miller.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.684
That's good enough for me.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.007
Good evening.

09:42.548 --> 09:44.081
Is Jefferson Smith at home?

09:44.183 --> 09:46.251
Won't you step in?

10:02.201 --> 10:05.429
- A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate?
- Listen.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.265
The simpleton of all times.
A big-eyed patriot.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.305
Knows Lincoln
and Washington by heart.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.500
Stands at attention
in the governor's presence.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.441
Collects stray boys and cats.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.807
He does what?

10:15.915 --> 10:18.074
You know, a perfect man.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.717
Never in politics in his life.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.979
Wouldn't know what it's all about
in 2 years, let alone 2 months.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.281
The important thing...

10:24.390 --> 10:26.515
...this was the genius of the stroke...

10:26.626 --> 10:28.091
...it means votes.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.752
The hero of 50,000 boys
and 100,000 parents.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.330
Look over those congratulations
pouring in.

10:34.433 --> 10:35.864
I tell you, gentlemen...

10:35.968 --> 10:38.901
You made this appointment
without asking me.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.097
When lightning strikes...
- You didn't ask me.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.370
Now wait a minute, Jim.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.041
Happy may have hit on something here.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.409
There, you see?

10:53.519 --> 10:56.816
Do you really think you can
handle him in Washington?

10:56.922 --> 10:58.717
Do you think it's all right?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.186
I think it's all right.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.620
A young patriot...

11:01.727 --> 11:03.658
...recites Lincoln and Jefferson...

11:03.763 --> 11:06.525
...turned loose in our nation's capitol.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.927
I think it's all right.

11:14.573 --> 11:15.624
Chick.

11:15.724 --> 11:18.539
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's
the greatest appointment ever made.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.405
Give a banquet and declare a holiday.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.547
A star-spangled banquet!

11:30.156 --> 11:33.089
And how did your governor
confer that honor?

11:33.192 --> 11:37.251
Did he give it to some wealthy
citizen, merely to curry favor?

11:37.763 --> 11:38.863
No!

11:39.365 --> 11:42.866
Did he give it to some
unworthy political hireling?

11:44.470 --> 11:46.367
What did he do?

11:46.472 --> 11:47.556
He went down...

11:47.656 --> 11:49.037
...among the people.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.831
And there he found...

11:52.778 --> 11:53.878
...a nugget.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.612
It is in that spirit that
we're here tonight...

12:01.721 --> 12:05.313
...to acclaim and wish Godspeed
to Senator...

12:05.791 --> 12:07.756
...Jefferson Smith.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.838
Thank you.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.804
I can't help feeling...

12:26.912 --> 12:30.243
...that there's been a big mistake
somehow.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.244
Of course, I never could see...

12:35.354 --> 12:38.651
...why we needed two senators
from this state...

12:38.758 --> 12:42.225
...when we have a man like
Joseph Harrison Paine...

12:42.328 --> 12:43.725
...representing us.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.022
He doesn't remember me.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.065
He knew my father very well.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.928
Clayton Smith.

12:52.037 --> 12:53.137
They...

12:53.606 --> 12:55.071
...went to school together.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.208
They were very good friends.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.078
Just to... sit here with him...

13:03.182 --> 13:05.716
...is a very great honor for me...

13:05.818 --> 13:09.183
...because I remember Dad
used to tell me that...

13:10.222 --> 13:12.984
...Joe Paine was the finest man
he ever knew.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.954
Go on, get up. Take a bow!

13:24.837 --> 13:29.465
I don't think I'll be much help to you
down there in Washington, senator.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.173
I'll do my best.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.071
Although with all my might...

13:36.182 --> 13:38.614
...I can promise you one thing:

13:39.318 --> 13:42.512
I'll do nothing to disgrace
the office of...

13:42.621 --> 13:44.552
...United States Senate.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.646
Senator Jefferson Smith...

14:15.888 --> 14:18.320
...the Boy Rangers are very proud...

14:18.424 --> 14:20.151
...to take this opportun...

14:20.259 --> 14:21.690
Occasion!

14:22.328 --> 14:25.022
We are happy to take this opportunity...

14:26.498 --> 14:27.531
To present....

14:27.631 --> 14:29.533
To resent this...

14:29.935 --> 14:33.869
...small token
of our affection and esteem...

14:34.273 --> 14:35.931
...to the best...

14:36.175 --> 14:37.275
Friend!

14:37.676 --> 14:40.370
Aw, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.

14:40.479 --> 14:41.579
We all pitched in.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.806
For to carry your laws when
you get to Washington.

15:21.553 --> 15:24.588
It isn't much,
but if you insist, here's this week's.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.816
Boys' Stuff.
Why, printer's ink runs in your veins.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.720
You're just like your father.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.488
- Thank you, sir.
- Even to the hat.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.530
Same old dreamer too.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.634
One look at you and I can see him...

15:37.736 --> 15:41.203
...back at his roll-top desk,
hat and all, getting out his paper.

15:41.307 --> 15:45.138
Always kept his hat on
so as to be ready to do battle.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.835
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.844
And champion of lost causes.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.042
Dad used to say the only causes
worth fighting for were the lost causes.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.684
You don't have to tell me.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.515
We were a team, the two of us.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.385
Struggling editor
and the struggling lawyer.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.186
The twin champions of lost causes,
they called us.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.693
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.366
His last fight was his best, Jeff.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.595
He and his little four-page paper...

16:11.704 --> 16:14.068
...against that mining syndicate.

16:14.173 --> 16:18.437
All to defend the right of one
small miner who stuck to his claim.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.339
They tried everything.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.207
Bribery...

16:23.916 --> 16:25.176
...intimidation.

16:26.685 --> 16:27.809
And then....

16:31.690 --> 16:34.918
Ma found him slumped over his desk
that morning.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.088
Shot in the back.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.295
I was there.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.398
I can see him.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.692
At that old roll-top desk.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.566
Still with his hat on.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.974
Still with his hat on.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.707
I know.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.782
I suppose, Mr. Paine...

16:58.884 --> 17:02.681
...when a fellow bucks up
against a big organization like that...

17:03.789 --> 17:06.517
...one man by himself
can't get very far, can he?

17:09.994 --> 17:11.095
Washington, huh?

17:11.463 --> 17:14.156
Yes, senator, for the fifth time.
Washington.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.362
I'd better see about my pigeons.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.829
The porter has them.

17:17.935 --> 17:20.003
Just a second. I'd better make sure.

17:20.406 --> 17:23.066
Joe, my head's like a balloon.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.540
Two whole days! I never knew
there was so much American history.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.007
They're all right.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.181
That's fine. That ends that crisis.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.849
Come along, senator.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.677
Hello, Father!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.283
- I saw!
- He's mine!

17:37.156 --> 17:39.087
Let me get to him.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.254
I don't care to meet him
till I get my money.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.960
A dollar each, please,
for the milk fund.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.389
That's $5.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.732
You've got $5, haven't you?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.840
Can't seem to find anything
except keys.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.909
Jeff, this is my daughter Susan
and her friends.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.672
- Not the new senator?
- He's marvelous.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.815
What have you got there, senator?

18:04.917 --> 18:08.976
- They're pigeons.
- To carry messages back to Ma.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.089
It's just for fun. The one that
makes it home in the best time...

18:12.191 --> 18:13.519
...I'll enter in the Nationals.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.090
- Joe!
- Hello, Chick.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.057
- Hello, Joe.
- Carl, how are you?

18:17.162 --> 18:18.490
Glad to see you, Bill.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.432
Jeff, come here.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.261
Meet Cook and Griffith,
from State Headquarters.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.666
Great pleasure.
You'll do the old state proud.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.934
Welcome. The wildlife here is
different from what you're used to.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.643
They wear high heels.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.037
We must see a lot of you...

18:36.148 --> 18:39.775
- ...and your little feathered friends.
- Thank you very much.

18:41.787 --> 18:42.911
Come on, Father.

18:44.256 --> 18:45.289
Chick.

18:45.389 --> 18:47.051
I've got him.
We'll be along.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.283
Good luck, senator.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.493
Goodbye.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.930
Things sure happen fast around here.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.395
You'll have to get yourself
out of low gear.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.728
Let's get these bags and livestock.

18:58.837 --> 18:59.937
Okay, Chick.

19:01.507 --> 19:03.006
Look, there it is!

19:03.108 --> 19:04.835
Who? What?

19:05.210 --> 19:06.800
The Capitol dome.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.274
Yes, sir, big as life.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.004
Been there a long time now.

19:10.115 --> 19:11.215
Yes, sir.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.344
This way, senator.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.024
We thought we'd
meet him in short pants...

19:25.130 --> 19:26.492
...with hatchets.

19:26.632 --> 19:27.732
Taxi.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.498
What's he got pigeons for?

19:29.601 --> 19:30.701
What for?

19:31.069 --> 19:33.296
Suppose there's a storm.
The lines are down.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.939
How you going to get messages
back to Ma?

19:36.041 --> 19:37.403
This way, senator.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.837
Where is he?

19:38.944 --> 19:40.044
Senator?

19:40.312 --> 19:42.039
I told that Cookie to....

19:42.147 --> 19:43.305
Let's find him.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.515
Senator!

19:44.983 --> 19:47.074
Senator Smith?

19:47.786 --> 19:49.717
Positively not in the station.

19:49.821 --> 19:50.905
What happened?

19:51.005 --> 19:52.522
Did you look in the...?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.184
I'll brain that guy.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.259
Call Paine. Call Saunders.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.191
Call the Marines. Call somebody!

20:00.065 --> 20:02.341
Saunders?
McGann.

20:02.441 --> 20:05.334
Has Smith showed up
at his office there yet?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.368
What do you mean, the slip?
What's so funny?

20:07.472 --> 20:08.539
Nothing.

20:08.639 --> 20:10.231
Why don't you try a butterfly net?

20:10.342 --> 20:11.670
If he shows up...

20:11.777 --> 20:14.243
...Paine's waiting at the hotel
with newspapermen.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.573
Let him know right away.
Understand?

20:16.682 --> 20:20.274
I'll hang a light in the belfry.
One if by land and two if by sea.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.282
- Diz?
- Yeah.

20:34.382 --> 20:36.831
What do you think?
Daniel Boone's lost.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.567
Lost in the wilds of Washington.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.898
If your boyfriend's
going to blaze trails...

20:43.008 --> 20:44.336
...I'm going to the press club.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.535
Stick around. He might want us to
put on short pants and go hiking.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.270
You wouldn't want to
miss the exercise.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.540
When I think of exercise,
I have to lie down...

20:51.650 --> 20:52.944
...until the feeling leaves me.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.909
Wouldn't it be funny
if he was lost?

20:55.020 --> 20:56.104
The Boy Ranger?

20:56.204 --> 20:57.550
Oh, he'll show up.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.815
He must have a compass with him.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.519
Where would I go
if I were a Boy Ranger?

21:02.628 --> 21:04.889
Boy, am I tired. I'm all in!

21:04.997 --> 21:08.498
Call all the hospitals.
And get me a bed while you're at it!

21:08.600 --> 21:10.930
Boss, will you hold this
a minute?

21:11.036 --> 21:12.467
Thank you, sir.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.532
Here! Come back here!

24:04.109 --> 24:06.700
...that from these honored dead
we take...

24:06.812 --> 24:09.881
...increased devotion that
that cause for which they...

24:09.981 --> 24:12.242
...gave the last full measure...

24:12.350 --> 24:14.077
...of devotion...

24:14.219 --> 24:16.253
...that we here highly....

24:16.354 --> 24:17.944
- Resolve.
- Resolve...

24:18.323 --> 24:21.483
...that these dead
shall not have died in vain.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.251
That this nation...

24:23.361 --> 24:26.897
...under God, shall have
a new birth of....

24:26.998 --> 24:28.098
Freedom.

24:28.366 --> 24:29.408
Freedom.

24:29.508 --> 24:31.661
And that government, of the people...

24:31.937 --> 24:33.004
...by the people...

24:33.104 --> 24:34.121
...for the people...

24:34.221 --> 24:37.036
...shall not perish from the earth.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.913
Why don't they try the police?

24:46.017 --> 24:47.744
Call out some bloodhounds...

24:47.853 --> 24:49.113
...or Indian guides.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.788
One place he knows
is the Senate office.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.513
You stay there and wait.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.055
All right,
another half-hour.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.727
Just one half-hour.
Goodbye.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.997
Oh, why don't I quit?

25:00.098 --> 25:02.530
Eight to five,
little boy blue's plastered.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.725
When Foley died, why didn't
I clear out?

25:04.836 --> 25:07.996
How many times have I said
I'm fed up with politics and l...

25:08.773 --> 25:11.865
No, I let them
talk me into staying.

25:11.977 --> 25:15.103
Secretary to a leader
of little squirts.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.314
Why? Because I need the job
and a new suit of clothes.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.848
Would you settle for a husband?

25:20.952 --> 25:23.213
I sure would.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.785
You know my old standing offer.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.177
Diz Moore...

25:29.277 --> 25:30.885
...poet of Washington correspondents.

25:30.996 --> 25:32.927
Oh, that again.

25:33.398 --> 25:34.431
I'd cherish you...

25:34.531 --> 25:35.726
...and I'd stay sober.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.562
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.

25:39.037 --> 25:43.870
I don't know, maybe if I saw you once
with your hair combed or something....

25:44.409 --> 25:46.534
I don't think even
that would do it.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.837
No point in combing
my hair for nothing.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.582
"Honorary appointment."

25:51.683 --> 25:56.083
Scratch this and you'll find they need
a dope here for a couple of months.

25:56.621 --> 25:57.983
Yes?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.221
Yes!

26:01.960 --> 26:03.002
What do you want?

26:03.102 --> 26:05.358
Office of Jefferson Smith?

26:07.832 --> 26:09.422
The man downstairs said...

26:18.510 --> 26:21.408
They sure must have
picked the prize dummy...

26:21.813 --> 26:23.244
Say, wait a minute!

26:23.348 --> 26:25.643
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?

26:27.018 --> 26:28.102
Say, mister...

26:28.202 --> 26:29.228
...what's your name?

26:29.328 --> 26:30.329
Jefferson Smith.

26:30.429 --> 26:31.682
Oh, yes, please...

26:31.790 --> 26:34.256
...come right in, Mr. Smith.
This way.

26:34.392 --> 26:35.584
Now, hold everything.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.989
Stay there. Now, don't move!

26:38.997 --> 26:41.190
Helen! Get me the Madison.
Senator Paine.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.866
Hurry up, will you?

26:43.602 --> 26:44.702
Is anything the matter?

26:46.671 --> 26:47.829
My dear senator...

26:47.939 --> 26:50.837
...it may be customary out on the
prairie to take leave of people...

26:50.942 --> 26:52.703
...and not show up for five hours...

26:52.811 --> 26:55.539
I'm very sorry
about that, Miss Sau...

26:55.647 --> 26:57.510
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.913
Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member
of the press. Mr. Moore, meet...

27:01.019 --> 27:02.279
...the senator.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.079
I'm very happy to know you.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.814
I see you cut your way
through that forest.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.426
Senator Paine. We've got him!

27:11.529 --> 27:14.097
Came in on his own power,
and he's sober.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.692
Next thing on the schedule,
I'll have him over there.

27:17.802 --> 27:18.835
Now....

27:18.935 --> 27:20.302
I'm awfully sorry.

27:20.405 --> 27:23.406
It wasn't until I was well along
on the bus that...

27:23.508 --> 27:24.768
Did you say bus?

27:24.876 --> 27:27.604
It was one of those
sightseers, you know?

27:27.712 --> 27:29.074
And...

27:31.383 --> 27:34.748
...I've never been called
absent-minded before...

27:35.387 --> 27:38.149
...but there it was, all of a sudden.

27:38.423 --> 27:41.356
It was staring at me
through the station doors.

27:41.459 --> 27:42.856
There what was?

27:42.961 --> 27:45.359
The dome. The Capitol dome.

27:45.830 --> 27:49.889
As big as life, sparkling away
under the old sun out there.

27:50.368 --> 27:51.628
And l...

27:52.303 --> 27:53.700
...I just...

27:53.805 --> 27:56.066
...started to go toward it.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.003
There was a bus outside and...

27:58.109 --> 27:59.938
...I just naturally got aboard.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.340
Most natural thing in the world.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.046
I don't think I've ever been so
thrilled in my whole life.

28:07.218 --> 28:09.479
And that Lincoln Memorial!

28:10.622 --> 28:12.622
Gee whiz!

28:13.224 --> 28:15.758
Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is.

28:17.362 --> 28:21.398
He's looking right straight
at you as you come up those steps.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.995
Just sitting there, like he was
waiting for somebody to come along.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.931
Well, he's got nothing on me.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.540
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.304
If you're ready,
we'll go to the hotel.

28:34.412 --> 28:36.639
Senator Paine's waiting for you.

28:46.591 --> 28:47.885
This is my office?

28:47.992 --> 28:50.686
No, you'll have a private office.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.728
- In there.
- Private office?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.628
In there?

28:59.671 --> 29:01.204
Right in this door?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.137
All right, now, senator....

29:09.247 --> 29:11.815
Where is he?
Has he gone out again?

29:11.950 --> 29:13.517
He's in there.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.015
I'll see you later.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.882
I got to go out
and drink this over.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.483
Whose statue's that?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.355
I wouldn't know, in the daytime.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.029
You wouldn't? Oh, look!

29:26.498 --> 29:29.499
Look at the Capitol dome!
It's all lighted up.

29:29.634 --> 29:33.670
You better relax, senator.
You'll get yourself plum wore out.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.932
Gee whiz! So many things
happening all at once.

29:38.042 --> 29:40.610
Miss Saunders, what time
does the Senate....

29:40.712 --> 29:41.870
Convene?

29:42.647 --> 29:45.238
- Twelve noon.
- Twelve noon, huh?

29:45.416 --> 29:47.916
Oh, boy, that'll be something!

29:48.253 --> 29:49.718
You know what I better do
in the morning?

29:49.821 --> 29:51.513
No, what had you better?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.953
I think I better go out
to Mount Vernon.

29:54.058 --> 29:56.319
Be sort of a fine thing to do.

29:57.128 --> 30:00.061
Visit Washington's home before walking
into the Senate for the first time.

30:00.165 --> 30:01.265
Think it's a good idea?

30:01.366 --> 30:04.435
Wonderful! Puts you
right in the mood.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.399
What's that? What's that?

30:09.140 --> 30:10.901
Movie houses.

30:13.578 --> 30:15.270
Hi, Saunders.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.277
I'm still asking myself, what is he:

30:17.382 --> 30:18.813
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

30:18.917 --> 30:20.017
Maybe an oyster.

30:20.118 --> 30:24.985
When I think of myself playing straight
for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me!

30:25.156 --> 30:28.350
Carrying bibs for an infant
with little flags in his fists.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.925
I can't take it, Diz.
I quit. I'm through.

30:31.029 --> 30:34.098
Now take it easy.
Simmer down. Here.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.493
Take this.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.964
Know what he's doing tomorrow
before taking the Senate seat?

30:40.071 --> 30:41.695
Going up to Mount Vernon...

30:41.806 --> 30:44.136
...to get in the mood.
A warm-up.

30:44.242 --> 30:45.342
Who? Your boss?

30:45.443 --> 30:48.239
A nut! I knew there was
a story in him. I smelled it!

30:48.346 --> 30:50.038
Go chase an ambulance.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.773
It's meat and drink to me.
Let me at him five minutes.

30:52.884 --> 30:53.934
I'll make it right.

30:54.034 --> 30:55.712
What do you mean "right"?

30:55.820 --> 30:57.217
I'll tell you what I'll do.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.719
World Series. A pass!

30:58.823 --> 31:00.948
In a month it'll be worth 15 bucks.

31:01.059 --> 31:02.109
Well!

31:02.209 --> 31:03.227
You're not talking to this guy.

31:03.327 --> 31:05.395
- What do you say?
- Nothing. Beat it.

31:05.495 --> 31:07.760
How would your pals like
to get in on this?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.160
- I want a scoop.
- Beat it!

31:09.267 --> 31:13.064
That's out. Either it's lots of
reporters and tickets, or....

31:13.171 --> 31:15.865
Better call him before
I change my mind.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.406
Okay. I'll see you right here.

31:20.478 --> 31:21.909
What are you going to do?

31:22.013 --> 31:24.946
Get my whole fall outfit
and quit this job in style.

31:25.049 --> 31:28.016
You've got more sense
than to put Nosey on to that guy.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.882
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

31:32.891 --> 31:34.288
Tell us about yourself.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.653
I hear you got a boys' club, senator.

31:36.761 --> 31:38.294
Any special ax to grind?

31:38.396 --> 31:39.622
- Ax?
- You know.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.061
Pet idea. Save the buffaloes,
pension bill.

31:42.166 --> 31:45.360
You must have one idea that would
be good for the country.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.060
Well, I have got one idea.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.863
That's what we want.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.371
For the last couple years,
I've thought it would be...

31:51.476 --> 31:54.807
...a wonderful idea to have a
national boys' camp in our state.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.913
Boys' camp?
Sure. Very good!

31:57.015 --> 31:59.515
If we could get
poor kids off the streets...

31:59.617 --> 32:02.652
...out of the cities for
a few months in the summer...

32:02.754 --> 32:05.220
...and let them learn something
about nature...

32:05.323 --> 32:06.583
...American ideals....

32:06.691 --> 32:07.849
Marvelous.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.549
What would it
cost the government?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.854
Nothing. Nothing at all.
You see...

32:11.963 --> 32:15.089
...the government just
lends us the money for the camp...

32:15.199 --> 32:17.233
...and then the boys...

32:17.335 --> 32:20.871
...pay it back by sending pennies,
nickels, nothing more than a dime.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.539
That's really something.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.170
Government's got enough
to do without...

32:26.277 --> 32:28.072
The government's
putting too much dough...

32:28.179 --> 32:29.871
...in too many places now, boys.

32:29.981 --> 32:32.106
Well, now, senator, tell me...

32:32.283 --> 32:34.908
...what do you think of
the girls in this town?

32:35.019 --> 32:36.916
Down at the station,
four of them...

32:37.021 --> 32:39.521
...kissed me when
I got off the train.

32:40.325 --> 32:42.655
Were they pretty?
- Pretty?

32:42.760 --> 32:44.191
That Miss Susan Paine...

32:44.295 --> 32:46.260
...is about the
prettiest I ever saw.

32:46.364 --> 32:48.762
Senator, you got a good eye!

32:48.900 --> 32:50.627
How about some more pictures?

32:50.735 --> 32:52.200
You're a nature lover...

32:52.303 --> 32:53.893
...can you handle sign language?

32:54.005 --> 32:55.163
I could manage, if...

32:55.273 --> 32:57.841
What about birdcalls?
You know any?

32:57.942 --> 33:00.806
- Can you make a sound like an eagle?
- How about a bobwhite?

33:00.912 --> 33:03.105
Here's one. I'm the
only one in the state...

33:03.348 --> 33:04.389
...that knows this one.

33:04.489 --> 33:05.743
We could use that!

33:28.873 --> 33:31.203
His "First 'Whiff' of Washington"?

33:33.444 --> 33:34.806
Do I actually see this?

33:34.912 --> 33:36.536
What is it?

33:38.883 --> 33:40.382
Did you want to see me?

33:40.485 --> 33:43.645
What's this I hear about your quitting?
- I'm not a nurse.

33:43.755 --> 33:44.822
Stop being funny.

33:44.922 --> 33:45.973
How'd this happen?

33:46.073 --> 33:49.957
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Yes, you have. How'd it happen?

33:50.061 --> 33:51.492
I merely took him home.

33:51.596 --> 33:54.358
I didn't tuck him in.
That's McGann's job.

33:54.465 --> 33:57.762
McGann just phoned. Smith's
gone again. Do you know where?

33:57.869 --> 34:00.961
He went to Mount Vernon
to give himself a patriotic address.

34:01.072 --> 34:02.503
That's fine.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.005
Now you go back to Smith's office...

34:05.109 --> 34:07.200
...and get him
to the Senate by 12:00.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.311
Senator, I wasn't
given a brain...

34:09.414 --> 34:11.641
...just to tell a Boy Ranger
the time.

34:11.748 --> 34:12.873
Don't be a fool.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.415
If certain things happen...

34:14.518 --> 34:17.179
...you'll get one of the biggest jobs
in Washington.

34:17.288 --> 34:21.188
When I came here, my eyes were
big blue question marks...

34:21.292 --> 34:23.155
...now they're big
green dollar marks.

34:23.261 --> 34:24.453
Smart girl, eh?

34:24.829 --> 34:27.693
Finish this job properly
and you'll get a bonus.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.264
I mean, keep Smith away...

34:29.367 --> 34:32.061
...from anything that
smacks of politics.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.964
Including Willet Creek Dam?

34:36.741 --> 34:38.364
Including Willet Creek Dam.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.304
Now go back to your work.

34:46.117 --> 34:47.878
This is it, senator.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.712
The United States Senate.

34:49.821 --> 34:50.920
Come on.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.625
Mr. Carson, Senator Smith.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.657
- How do you do?
- How do you do, senator?

34:57.762 --> 34:58.804
Page!

34:58.904 --> 35:00.295
- Glad to see you.
- Thank you.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.466
Show Senator Smith to his seat.

35:02.567 --> 35:03.793
Right this way, sir.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.764
Well, goodbye.

35:06.337 --> 35:07.836
Wish me luck.
- Sure.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.233
Bye.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.326
So that's the boy wonder?

35:37.435 --> 35:40.163
I don't know what the Senate's
coming to.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.597
- Hi, Diz.
- Hello, Saunders.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.298
Daryl, Sweeney.

35:45.776 --> 35:48.071
I see you got Daniel Boone
in all right.

35:48.179 --> 35:49.837
Daniel in the lion's den.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.077
Nice job you and
the ambulance chasers did...

35:52.183 --> 35:53.250
...in the papers this morning.

35:53.350 --> 35:54.645
- Did you like it?
- Great.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.983
Here you are, Senator.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.521
Not a bad desk, either.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.716
Daniel Webster used to use it.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.258
Daniel Webster sat here?

36:04.362 --> 36:05.520
Holy mackerel!

36:05.696 --> 36:08.993
Give you something to shoot at,
if you figure on doing any talking.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.724
I'm just going to
sit and listen.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.835
That's the way to get re-elected.

36:12.937 --> 36:15.301
This is the calendar for the day.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.632
You'll find this
and a manual, in here.

36:17.742 --> 36:18.826
Anything else...

36:18.926 --> 36:20.204
...just snap for a page.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.935
Where's the majority leader?

36:22.046 --> 36:23.204
Majority leader?

36:23.314 --> 36:26.076
Right over there.
Senator Agnew.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.944
That's Senator Barnes,
the minority leader.

36:29.053 --> 36:30.450
Where's the press gallery?

36:30.555 --> 36:33.089
There,
above the vice president's chair.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.124
Those in the front row
represent the big news services.

36:36.227 --> 36:37.327
What's up there?

36:37.428 --> 36:39.428
That's for guides
and sightseers...

36:39.530 --> 36:42.656
...who come in for five minutes
at a time to rest their feet.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.862
That section is reserved
for the senators' friends.

36:46.137 --> 36:49.502
Front row, the empty one, is for
the President and his guests.

36:49.607 --> 36:50.649
I see.

36:50.749 --> 36:53.141
Over the clock
is the diplomatic section.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.014
They and the pageboys are the only
real class we have here.

36:59.116 --> 37:02.185
- Thanks so much.
- I'll take your hat to the cloakroom.

37:02.286 --> 37:04.115
I want to give you
a Boy Ranger button.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.255
Swell!

37:05.355 --> 37:07.017
What's your name?
- Richard Jones.

37:07.124 --> 37:08.384
Thanks ever so much.

37:08.659 --> 37:11.592
Good luck, senator.
Keep your left up.

37:12.196 --> 37:15.129
- See you in the White House, Joe.
- You're not kidding!

37:15.733 --> 37:16.959
- Jeff.
- Hello, senator.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.192
I was in committee.

37:18.302 --> 37:19.494
That's all right, sir.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.729
I see you had a little publicity.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.633
Have you got your credentials?

37:25.676 --> 37:27.676
Miss Saunders gave them to me.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.070
Is that right?

37:31.015 --> 37:32.241
That's fine.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.384
When the vice president
calls you...

37:34.485 --> 37:37.850
- ...I'll meet you in the center aisle.
- Center aisle.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.956
This is Daniel Webster's desk.
Did you know that?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.557
He won't mind.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.987
The Senate will come to order.

38:15.092 --> 38:17.092
Chaplain will pray.

38:18.362 --> 38:20.657
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father...

38:20.765 --> 38:22.059
...in these critical days...

38:22.166 --> 38:26.168
...when our beloved country labors with
such grave problems...

38:26.270 --> 38:27.667
...look upon us...

38:27.772 --> 38:31.308
...and give us the strength
to be just and merciful...

38:31.409 --> 38:33.477
...so we may best
serve our people...

38:33.577 --> 38:35.611
...and our fellow men
everywhere.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.071
Amen.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.316
- Clerk will read...
- Mr. President...

38:47.425 --> 38:51.291
...I ask unanimous consent the reading
of the journal be dispensed with.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.826
Is there objection?

38:53.497 --> 38:54.859
Journal stands approved.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.362
Mr. President.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.296
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

38:58.402 --> 38:59.486
Clerk will call the roll.

38:59.586 --> 39:01.467
- Mr. Agnew.
- Here.

39:01.572 --> 39:02.798
- Mr. Albert.
- Here.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.201
- Mr. Alfred.
- Here.

39:04.875 --> 39:08.604
88 senators have answered
to their names, all as present.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.542
- Mr. President.
- Senator Paine.

39:10.648 --> 39:13.546
I present the credentials of
Honorable Jefferson Smith...

39:13.651 --> 39:16.618
...who has just been appointed
by the governor of my state.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.254
The designate is present.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.254
I ask that the oath of office be
administered at this time.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.893
The senator designate will
present himself.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.229
The oath will be administered.

39:43.614 --> 39:45.079
Mr. President...

39:45.182 --> 39:46.909
...I rise to a question of order.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.642
- Here it comes.
- I seek to ascertain if the gentleman...

39:49.754 --> 39:54.348
...about to be sworn in is aware
of the responsibilities of his office.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.753
I refer to his
shameless performance...

39:56.861 --> 39:58.053
...for the newspapers.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.396
A versatile performance,
I grant you...

40:00.498 --> 40:03.362
...and one that his party,
no doubt, will applaud.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.835
But one that lowers his rank...

40:06.937 --> 40:09.267
...to the level of a
sideshow entertainer...

40:09.373 --> 40:12.033
...and reflects on the sincerity,
if not the sanity...

40:12.143 --> 40:14.803
...of the highest body
of lawmakers in the land.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.106
I seek to learn if this
is the gentleman's conception...

40:18.215 --> 40:19.714
...of the nature of his office.

40:19.817 --> 40:20.867
I don't understand.

40:20.967 --> 40:24.613
The designate has no voice here
until taking the oath of office.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.086
Mr. President,
I will answer the gentleman.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.725
My colleague was innocent
in this matter.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.417
He was completely misquoted.

40:31.529 --> 40:35.087
I know Jefferson Smith, and I will
personally vouch for him.

40:35.199 --> 40:38.928
He has the greatest respect for his
office and for these gentleman.

40:39.069 --> 40:40.602
Mr. President.

40:40.971 --> 40:44.666
The swearing in of the senator
designate is the order of business.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.105
The gentleman will raise
his right hand.

40:47.211 --> 40:48.573
Do you swear to support...

40:48.679 --> 40:51.612
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

40:51.715 --> 40:54.511
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

40:54.618 --> 40:58.313
...and that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same?

40:58.422 --> 41:00.649
That you take this obligation freely...

41:00.758 --> 41:03.918
...without mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

41:04.028 --> 41:09.031
...and that you will faithfully
discharge the duties of this office...

41:09.366 --> 41:11.127
...so help you God?

41:11.535 --> 41:12.863
I do.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.971
Senator, you can talk
all you want to now.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.369
Meet the majority leader.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.909
He'll be a good friend to you.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.238
How do you do, sir?

41:23.347 --> 41:26.007
Any friend of Joe's
is a friend of mine.

41:26.116 --> 41:29.379
Don't worry about the others,
they're just senators.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.988
- Mr. President.
- Senator MacPherson.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.953
The shameless way the
deficiency bill has been delayed...

41:36.060 --> 41:37.957
...is nothing short of criminal.

41:38.062 --> 41:42.223
Government agencies are
in desperate need of these funds.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.426
The prime business of this body
is the immediate passage....

42:26.377 --> 42:29.674
- Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here?
Why aren't you chasing ambulances?

42:29.780 --> 42:32.781
Smith's punching everybody
he meets. I just got away.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.041
Uh-oh, Tarzan!

42:44.228 --> 42:46.091
Boys, meet Senator Smith.

42:47.798 --> 42:49.525
You act like
something's on your mind.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.530
Why don't you tell the people
the truth?

42:51.702 --> 42:53.531
- The truth?
- He wants the truth!

42:53.637 --> 42:55.034
The man wants the truth.

42:55.139 --> 42:57.207
"'What is the truth?' said
jesting Pilate...

42:57.308 --> 42:58.932
...and would not stay for an answer."

42:59.043 --> 43:01.202
How do you want it?
Dished out or in a bottle?

43:01.545 --> 43:03.909
People pick up their papers,
and what do they read?

43:04.014 --> 43:08.312
This morning they read that a
clown arrived in Washington...

43:08.485 --> 43:11.110
...parading like
a member of the Senate.

43:13.757 --> 43:17.315
If you thought as much about being
honest as you do about being smart....

43:17.428 --> 43:20.520
We're the only ones who can
be honest in what we tell the voters.

43:20.631 --> 43:24.258
We don't have to be re-elected,
like politicians.

43:24.368 --> 43:27.665
We tell them when phonies and
crackpots come here to make their laws.

43:27.771 --> 43:30.032
If you want the truth,
why are you in the Senate?

43:30.140 --> 43:32.708
What do you know about making laws?
Or what the people need?

43:32.810 --> 43:33.843
I don't pretend to know.

43:33.943 --> 43:35.434
Then what are you doing
in the Senate?

43:35.546 --> 43:38.672
What's he doing?
Why, honorary appointment!

43:39.450 --> 43:43.816
When the country needs men who know
and have courage as it never did before...

43:43.921 --> 43:46.990
...he's going to decorate a chair
and get honored.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.622
But he'll vote! Just like his
colleague tells him too.

43:50.728 --> 43:53.626
Like a Christmas tiger,
he'll nod his head and vote...

43:53.731 --> 43:56.129
..."Yes!"

43:56.233 --> 43:57.925
You're not a senator.

43:58.202 --> 44:01.669
You're an honorary stooge.
You ought to be shown up.

44:01.939 --> 44:03.301
Have a drink, senator?

44:03.407 --> 44:05.600
It'll taste better than the truth.

44:14.985 --> 44:16.245
Hey, senator.

44:17.521 --> 44:18.883
Don't let it get you down.

44:18.989 --> 44:21.956
100 years from now,
nobody'll know the difference.

44:22.726 --> 44:24.602
The point is, sir,
they're right.

44:24.702 --> 44:27.389
I'm just sitting in the Senate,
decorating a chair.

44:27.498 --> 44:32.035
If I'm going to vote, I ought
to study the bills that are coming up.

44:32.202 --> 44:33.252
The bills?

44:33.352 --> 44:37.737
Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a
Christmas tiger, like they said.

44:38.142 --> 44:42.303
These bills are put together by
legal minds after long study.

44:42.413 --> 44:46.142
I can't understand half of them
myself, and I was a lawyer.

44:46.250 --> 44:48.284
Come on. Forget it.

44:48.385 --> 44:50.248
I'll advise you how to vote.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.354
I know you will.
That's the point.

44:52.456 --> 44:54.524
There's no reason for me
to be here.

44:54.625 --> 44:59.321
Didn't you say something about
wanting to create a national boys' camp?

44:59.430 --> 45:02.021
- You were in earnest, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.461
Why don't you do it?
There's a job for you.

45:04.568 --> 45:06.795
Get a bill started.
Present it to Congress.

45:06.904 --> 45:08.369
It will be great experience.

45:08.472 --> 45:12.008
Senator Paine, I've been
aching to mention it to you.

45:12.109 --> 45:15.804
If I could do that one thing
while I'm here, I'd feel...

45:15.913 --> 45:18.481
What's to stop you?
Saunders will help you.

45:18.582 --> 45:20.616
Well, I'll do it.
I will!

45:20.851 --> 45:23.545
I knew if anyone could help me,
you could.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.221
Thank you again for your time.

45:25.355 --> 45:26.388
Good night.

45:26.488 --> 45:28.151
Where are you running off to?

45:28.258 --> 45:30.724
I'm anxious to get
back to the office.

45:33.831 --> 45:35.762
The man on the front page!

45:35.866 --> 45:39.129
- He just dropped in for a minute.
- How do you do, senator?

45:39.236 --> 45:40.803
How do you do, Miss Paine?

45:40.904 --> 45:42.232
I'm on my way to the office.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.187
- How are the pigeons?
- They're fine.

45:44.287 --> 45:46.001
I miss the dear little things.

45:46.110 --> 45:48.940
I released one this morning
with a letter.

45:49.046 --> 45:53.014
He flew right straight up in the air
to get his bearings.

45:53.117 --> 45:57.278
He went around the Capitol dome,
then headed west, like a bat out of...

45:57.387 --> 45:59.216
Just like a rifle shot.

45:59.323 --> 46:01.653
I suppose by about this time...

46:01.759 --> 46:03.952
...he's probably over Kentucky.

46:04.061 --> 46:05.924
Isn't that wonderful, Father?

46:06.296 --> 46:08.421
And was the letter to your girl?

46:08.999 --> 46:12.125
No, I don't have a girl.

46:12.236 --> 46:14.167
Don't you think I'd better
hold this for you?

46:14.271 --> 46:16.134
No, I think I'd better go.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.432
Good night.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.402
Doggone!

46:22.579 --> 46:24.112
It's all right, sir.

46:24.214 --> 46:26.839
That's all right, my boy.
Don't bother.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.180
Gee, I'm sorry.

46:35.292 --> 46:36.325
Good night.

46:36.425 --> 46:37.688
Good night, Jeff.

46:37.795 --> 46:38.953
Good night.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.301
Oh, Father!

46:51.842 --> 46:52.875
Dear me!

46:52.975 --> 46:55.103
At the expense of
some of the furniture...

46:55.212 --> 46:56.779
...you've made another conquest.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.208
Not old Honest Abe!

46:58.315 --> 47:00.747
And with Honest Abe's ideals.

47:01.618 --> 47:04.278
A rare man these days, Susan.

47:05.923 --> 47:07.724
We're going ahead with it.

47:07.824 --> 47:08.825
Ahead with what?

47:08.925 --> 47:10.926
My bill for
a national boys' camp.

47:11.028 --> 47:12.220
Where's my briefcase?

47:12.329 --> 47:13.760
Do I understand...

47:13.864 --> 47:15.158
...that you're going to present a bill?

47:15.265 --> 47:17.356
Senator Paine and I decided...

47:17.467 --> 47:19.091
Senator Paine decided with you?

47:19.203 --> 47:21.498
I should have
been the one to think of it.

47:21.605 --> 47:22.638
My dear senator...

47:22.738 --> 47:25.799
...have you the faintest idea
how to get a bill passed?

47:25.909 --> 47:28.000
No. You're going to help me.

47:28.111 --> 47:29.508
If I were triplets I could.

47:29.613 --> 47:31.704
Senator Paine said
you'd help me.

47:31.949 --> 47:33.448
What do we have to have?

47:33.550 --> 47:35.140
Look, do you mind...

47:35.252 --> 47:38.321
...if I give you a rough idea
what you're up against?

47:38.422 --> 47:39.522
No, go ahead.

47:41.592 --> 47:45.184
A senator has a bill in mind,
like your camp, right?

47:45.295 --> 47:46.379
What does he do?

47:46.479 --> 47:48.224
He has to sit down
and write it.

47:48.332 --> 47:50.923
The why, when, where, how
and everything else.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.101
That takes time.

47:52.201 --> 47:53.429
But this one is so simple.

47:53.904 --> 47:55.437
I see. This one's simple.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.766
- And with your help...
- Oh, I'm helping.

47:57.875 --> 47:58.942
Simple, and I'm helping...

47:59.042 --> 48:02.601
...so we knock it off in record time,
say three or four days.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.371
Oh, a day.

48:04.481 --> 48:06.742
- A day?
- Yes, just tonight.

48:08.252 --> 48:09.293
Tonight.

48:09.393 --> 48:10.909
I don't want to complain...

48:11.021 --> 48:14.557
...but in civilized countries
there's an institution called "dinner."

48:14.992 --> 48:17.117
I'm sort of hungry myself.

48:17.527 --> 48:22.155
Couldn't we have some stuff brought
in on trays, like big executives?

48:22.266 --> 48:23.799
Oh, sure.

48:24.001 --> 48:26.968
Dinner comes in on trays.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.467
We light into this...

48:28.572 --> 48:31.038
And we finish the bill before morning.

48:31.141 --> 48:32.265
It's dawn.

48:32.376 --> 48:34.876
Your bill is ready. You introduce it.

48:34.978 --> 48:36.011
How?

48:36.111 --> 48:37.273
You get to your feet...

48:37.381 --> 48:39.540
...take a breath,
and start spouting.

48:39.650 --> 48:43.652
Not too loud. A couple of
the senators might want to sleep.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.049
A curly-headed pageboy
takes it to the desk...

48:46.156 --> 48:49.316
...where a clerk reads it,
refers it to a committee...

48:49.426 --> 48:51.460
Committee, huh? Why?

48:52.930 --> 48:57.364
Committees. Small groups
of senators have to sift a bill down...

48:57.467 --> 48:59.762
...study it,
and report to the Senate.

48:59.870 --> 49:01.801
Can't take a bill
nobody ever heard of...

49:01.905 --> 49:04.337
...and discuss it among 96 men.
Where would you get?

49:04.441 --> 49:05.599
I see that.

49:06.243 --> 49:08.573
Good.
Now, where are we?

49:08.712 --> 49:10.245
Some committee's got it.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.378
Days are going by, senator.

49:12.482 --> 49:14.379
Days, weeks!

49:15.252 --> 49:17.445
Finally, they think it's quite a bill.

49:17.554 --> 49:20.145
It goes to the House of
Representatives for a vote...

49:20.257 --> 49:22.825
- ...but waits on the calendar.
- Calendar?

49:23.093 --> 49:24.854
That's the order of business.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.927
Your bill has to stand back in line...

49:27.030 --> 49:29.963
- ...unless the steering committee...
What's that?

49:30.133 --> 49:31.700
Steering committee?

49:34.604 --> 49:37.089
Do you really think
we're getting anywhere?

49:37.189 --> 49:39.174
Tell me, what's
the steering committee?

49:39.643 --> 49:41.643
Committee of the
majority party leaders.

49:41.745 --> 49:44.814
They decide when a bill is important
enough to be at the head of the list.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.015
Well, this is.

49:46.683 --> 49:48.512
Pardon me. This is.

49:49.686 --> 49:51.344
Where are we now?
- Over in the House.

49:51.621 --> 49:52.745
Oh, yeah. House.

49:52.856 --> 49:56.016
More amendments, more changes,
and the bill goes back to the Senate.

49:56.126 --> 49:59.389
The Senate doesn't like what the
House did; they make more changes.

49:59.563 --> 50:01.995
The House doesn't like
those changes. Stymied.

50:02.099 --> 50:03.199
So?

50:03.300 --> 50:05.561
So they appoint men from each House
to go into a huddle...

50:05.669 --> 50:07.794
...called a conference,
and they battle it out.

50:07.904 --> 50:11.462
Finally, if your bill is still alive
after all this vivisection...

50:11.575 --> 50:13.506
...it comes to a vote.

50:14.211 --> 50:15.244
Yes, sir!

50:15.344 --> 50:17.677
The big day finally arrives...

50:17.781 --> 50:19.348
...and Congress adjourns.

50:23.286 --> 50:24.944
Catching on, senator?

50:28.125 --> 50:30.216
Shall we start right away
or order dinner first?

50:30.627 --> 50:31.660
Pardon me?

50:31.760 --> 50:33.456
I said, shall we start...

50:33.563 --> 50:34.663
Oh, sure.

50:35.032 --> 50:36.073
Why not?

50:36.173 --> 50:39.100
Do you mind if I take the time
to go get a pencil?

50:39.202 --> 50:41.600
- Go right ahead!
- Thank you very much.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.864
Go right ahead.
And lots of paper too.

50:44.341 --> 50:46.671
Now, the...
Doggone it!

50:46.777 --> 50:49.778
Ever have so much to say about
something, you just couldn't say it?

50:49.880 --> 50:52.574
- Try sitting down.
- I did. I got right back up.

50:53.150 --> 50:55.184
Let's get down to particulars.

50:55.285 --> 50:57.080
How big is this thing?
Where is it?

50:57.187 --> 50:58.686
How many boys will it accommodate?

50:58.789 --> 51:01.187
You've got to have all that
in it, you know?

51:01.291 --> 51:02.858
And something else, Miss Saunders.

51:02.959 --> 51:07.462
The spirit of it. The idea.

51:07.597 --> 51:09.358
How do you say it?

51:11.935 --> 51:13.900
That's what's got to be in it.

51:14.504 --> 51:15.628
The Capitol dome.

51:16.606 --> 51:17.673
On paper?

51:17.773 --> 51:20.469
I want to make that come to life
for every boy in this land.

51:20.577 --> 51:23.202
Yes, and all lighted up
like that too.

51:24.181 --> 51:27.614
You see, boys forget what
their country means...

51:27.717 --> 51:30.547
...by just reading "the land
of the free" in history books.

51:30.754 --> 51:33.448
They get to be men
and forget even more.

51:34.391 --> 51:38.325
Liberty is too precious a thing
to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.

51:38.829 --> 51:40.362
Men should hold it up
in front of them...

51:40.464 --> 51:42.930
...every single day of their
lives and say...

51:43.033 --> 51:44.657
...I'm free...

51:45.469 --> 51:47.264
...to think and to speak.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.968
My ancestors couldn't.
I can...

51:50.674 --> 51:52.435
...and my children will.

51:53.944 --> 51:56.478
Boys ought to
grow up remembering that.

51:57.114 --> 52:00.479
And that steering committee,
they've got to see it like that.

52:00.584 --> 52:03.915
I know Senator Paine will do
all he can to help me, because...

52:04.020 --> 52:05.815
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?

52:06.623 --> 52:09.624
- He knew my father real well.
- He did?

52:10.093 --> 52:14.129
We need a lot more like him.
His kind of character, his ideals.

52:14.498 --> 52:16.589
Let's get on with this.

52:17.667 --> 52:19.598
This camp will be in your state?

52:19.703 --> 52:23.239
About 200 of the most beautiful
acres that ever were.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.567
You've never been
out in that country, have you?

52:25.675 --> 52:27.743
I've been over every single foot of it.

52:27.844 --> 52:29.377
You have to see it yourself.

52:29.479 --> 52:33.640
I don't know. The prairies, and
wind leaning on the tall grass...

52:33.917 --> 52:35.507
...lazy streams down in the meadows...

52:35.619 --> 52:38.688
...angry little midgets of water
up in the mountains.

52:38.788 --> 52:41.982
Cattle moving down the slope,
against the sun.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.749
Campfires...

52:43.927 --> 52:45.961
...and snowdrifts....

52:46.930 --> 52:50.466
Everybody ought to have some
of that, sometime in his life.

52:50.567 --> 52:52.396
My dad had the right idea.

52:52.636 --> 52:54.499
He had it all worked out.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.705
He used to say to me, "Son...

52:56.806 --> 52:59.374
...don't miss the wonders
that surround you.

52:59.576 --> 53:03.578
Because every tree, every rock,
every anthill, every star...

53:03.680 --> 53:06.271
...is filled with
the wonders of nature."

53:07.350 --> 53:08.974
He used to say to me...

53:09.085 --> 53:12.154
..."Did you ever notice how grateful
you are to see daylight...

53:12.255 --> 53:16.018
...after coming through
a long, dark tunnel?"

53:16.126 --> 53:19.787
"Well," he'd say, "always try to see
life around you...

53:19.896 --> 53:21.964
...as if you just came
out of a tunnel."

53:26.169 --> 53:27.759
Where did you come from?

53:28.505 --> 53:31.039
I guess I've always lived
in a tunnel.

53:31.474 --> 53:32.574
You mean here?

53:33.076 --> 53:34.939
Baltimore. Pure city dweller.

53:35.345 --> 53:36.571
Have you always had to work?

53:36.680 --> 53:38.372
Since I was about sixteen.

53:38.481 --> 53:39.514
Sixteen?

53:39.614 --> 53:41.607
I take it your parents couldn't...

53:41.718 --> 53:43.115
No, Father was a doctor.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.754
He thought more of ethics
than he did of collections.

53:45.855 --> 53:48.583
Speaks well for Father,
but it wasn't so...

53:49.025 --> 53:51.525
Now, look, we'd better get back to this.

53:51.828 --> 53:53.225
Hasn't been easy, has it?

53:53.330 --> 53:54.556
No complaints.

53:55.131 --> 53:57.631
For a woman, you've done awfully well.

53:58.134 --> 53:59.234
Have l?

54:00.937 --> 54:05.406
I've never known anyone as capable
and intelligent....

54:08.311 --> 54:11.642
I don't know where I'd be in this
bill if it wasn't for your help.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.908
I don't know where you are with it.

54:17.153 --> 54:19.915
Gee whiz, we've got to get
going with this.

54:20.023 --> 54:21.988
All right, now, let's see.

54:23.727 --> 54:26.819
Everybody calls you just plain
"Saunders." Why can't l?

54:26.930 --> 54:28.156
Go right ahead.

54:28.265 --> 54:29.365
Saunders.

54:29.466 --> 54:30.726
That's much better.

54:30.834 --> 54:33.494
"Hello, Saunders."
"Good morning, Saunders."

54:34.771 --> 54:37.999
- "How's the bill coming, Saunders?"
- Terrible, thank you.

54:38.108 --> 54:41.109
Anyway, I got that "Saunders" business
straightened out.

54:41.211 --> 54:43.711
All right, now! I...

54:43.813 --> 54:45.471
What's your first name?

54:45.749 --> 54:46.907
Why?

54:47.417 --> 54:49.451
Everybody calls you
just "Saunders."

54:49.552 --> 54:51.415
I also answer to whistles.

54:51.521 --> 54:52.815
You've got a first name?

54:52.922 --> 54:55.616
Yes, but we just better
forget about it.

54:55.725 --> 54:57.383
All right, all right.

54:58.662 --> 55:00.093
I was just curious.

55:00.196 --> 55:04.494
A picture popped into my mind of
a pump without a handle or something.

55:06.736 --> 55:08.827
Of course, I know what it is.
Violet.

55:09.506 --> 55:11.130
No, it isn't.

55:11.241 --> 55:12.341
Abigail?

55:13.677 --> 55:15.142
Letitia?

55:15.245 --> 55:16.676
Lena?

55:17.380 --> 55:19.641
You might as well tell me.
I've got a lot more.

55:19.749 --> 55:21.544
All right. You win.

55:21.651 --> 55:22.775
It's Clarissa.

55:23.219 --> 55:24.547
Clarissa.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.227
All right, Saunders, let's go!

55:33.129 --> 55:35.823
Now, Susan's an awfully
pretty name, isn't it?

55:36.099 --> 55:39.191
Susan? Susan Paine?
Oh, it's beautiful.

55:40.270 --> 55:41.837
She's a beautiful woman,
isn't she?

55:42.072 --> 55:47.109
Isn't she a beautiful girl?
I think she's about the most beautiful...

55:48.278 --> 55:51.313
We've got to get started on this,
or we'll never get it finished.

55:51.414 --> 55:54.381
Get set, because I'm going to talk
much faster than you can write.

55:54.484 --> 55:55.642
You ready?

55:56.286 --> 55:59.514
The location of this camp.
About 200 acres...

55:59.622 --> 56:01.917
...situated in Ambrose County,
Terry Canyon.

56:02.025 --> 56:04.787
Running a quarter mile on
either side of Willet Creek.

56:05.829 --> 56:06.862
What?

56:06.962 --> 56:09.523
Willet Creek. W-I-L-L-E-T.
It's a little stream.

56:09.632 --> 56:10.732
In Terry Canyon?

56:10.834 --> 56:12.663
You don't know it, do you?

56:14.504 --> 56:16.936
You've never been there, you said.

56:17.107 --> 56:20.574
You've discussed this with
Senator Paine, haven't you?

56:20.677 --> 56:21.777
No, no. Why?

56:22.645 --> 56:24.610
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

56:24.714 --> 56:27.442
There's no reason to
talk it over with him.

56:27.550 --> 56:30.847
"A quarter of a mile on
either side of Willet Creek."

56:30.954 --> 56:35.252
And the land to be bought by the
contribution of the boys...

56:35.358 --> 56:38.825
...the money to be loaned to us by
the United States.

56:40.530 --> 56:43.531
Excuse me. Pardon me.

56:46.069 --> 56:48.330
What did you get me
out of bed for?

56:48.438 --> 56:50.267
Sit tight.
The show's about to commence.

56:50.373 --> 56:52.373
Mind telling me what's going on?

56:52.475 --> 56:53.508
Certainly.

56:53.608 --> 56:56.374
There's the principal
actor in our little play.

56:56.479 --> 56:58.843
"Don Quixote" Smith, Man With Bill.

56:59.500 --> 57:01.693
- Here, one of the supporting characters.
Who?

57:01.836 --> 57:04.234
That gorilla in man's clothing,
McGann.

57:04.338 --> 57:05.962
You mean Puss-in-Boots?

57:06.073 --> 57:07.800
Mostly Puss.

57:09.243 --> 57:12.695
Another prominent character in
our play, the Silver Knight.

57:12.795 --> 57:14.370
Soul of honor on a tightrope.

57:14.482 --> 57:17.050
You wouldn't be a little goofy,
would you?

57:18.019 --> 57:21.247
Don Quixote will stand up in a
minute and speak two important words...

57:21.355 --> 57:22.547
..."Willet Creek."

57:22.657 --> 57:25.521
Then the Silver Knight
will fall off his tightrope...

57:25.626 --> 57:28.388
...and "Puss" will jump
out of his boots.

57:29.096 --> 57:30.720
It is so ordered.

57:31.866 --> 57:33.399
Introduction of new bills...

57:33.501 --> 57:35.159
...and joint resolutions.

57:36.304 --> 57:37.654
Mr. President!

57:46.414 --> 57:51.383
The chair recognizes the rather
strong-lunged junior senator...

57:51.986 --> 57:53.086
...Mr. Smith.

57:54.422 --> 57:56.012
I'm sorry.
I have a bill...

57:56.123 --> 57:58.157
You may speak a little louder.

57:58.259 --> 57:59.386
But not too loud.

58:03.464 --> 58:05.088
I have a bill to propose.

58:10.004 --> 58:11.662
Order, gentlemen.

58:12.173 --> 58:15.572
Our junior senator
is about to make a speech.

58:20.881 --> 58:22.187
You may proceed.

58:28.889 --> 58:33.255
"Be it enacted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives...

58:34.061 --> 58:36.686
...that there be appropriated
as a loan...

58:37.064 --> 58:41.066
...a sum sufficient to create
a national boys' camp...

58:41.202 --> 58:44.169
...to be paid back to the
U.S. Treasury...

58:44.271 --> 58:47.033
...by contributions from
boys of America.

58:47.842 --> 58:49.068
This camp...

58:49.176 --> 58:52.302
...to be situated on land at
and adjacent to...

58:52.413 --> 58:55.243
...the headwaters of a stream
known as Willet Creek...

58:55.349 --> 58:57.110
...in Terry Canyon...

58:59.420 --> 59:03.718
...for the purpose of bringing together
boys of all walks of life...

59:04.458 --> 59:07.425
...from various parts of the country.

59:07.995 --> 59:11.394
Boys of all creeds, kinds
and positions.

59:12.133 --> 59:17.000
To educate them in American ideals
and to promote mutual understanding.

59:17.104 --> 59:19.365
To bring about a healthful life...

59:19.473 --> 59:22.633
...to the youth of this
great and beautiful land."

01:00:05.319 --> 01:00:08.911
Our senator will make a good orator
when his voice stops changing.

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:16.119
I'm getting leery of him. We call him
dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair.

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:20.426
When he finds out a dam is going up
where he wants his boys' camp...

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.898
...he's going to ask questions.

01:00:23.003 --> 01:00:25.162
Be quiet. I'm trying to think.

01:00:26.173 --> 01:00:28.639
This deficiency bill
will be read tomorrow.

01:00:28.743 --> 01:00:29.776
Tomorrow?

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:33.369
He'll hear that section
on the Willet Dam. He can't be there.

01:00:33.481 --> 01:00:37.483
I'll take him to see monuments, even if
I have to hit him on the head with one.

01:00:37.585 --> 01:00:38.777
That won't work.

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:41.079
This boy's honest, not stupid.

01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:42.889
Susan.

01:00:44.058 --> 01:00:46.786
My daughter won't carry out
such assignments.

01:01:04.879 --> 01:01:08.073
Senator!
If you let me handle your publicity...

01:01:09.817 --> 01:01:11.851
Down, everybody!

01:01:18.159 --> 01:01:19.521
Who are those people?

01:01:19.727 --> 01:01:21.818
Phonies, office seekers, cranks.

01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:23.758
"Get my son in or out of West Point..."

01:01:23.864 --> 01:01:28.458
This machine creates a fever 10 miles
away. It'll make you a fortune.

01:01:28.969 --> 01:01:30.627
Long-distance fevers.

01:01:30.738 --> 01:01:33.636
A woman wrote a song to replace
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:35.399
Want to hear it?
- Not today.

01:01:35.509 --> 01:01:38.601
I feel like a house afire.
Even went to see Mr. Lincoln.

01:01:38.712 --> 01:01:40.541
- How did I do?
- Great.

01:01:40.648 --> 01:01:43.376
My heart was right up to here
all the time.

01:01:43.484 --> 01:01:45.882
What did Paine think?
- Tickled pink.

01:01:45.986 --> 01:01:47.576
Oh, boy! I hope so.

01:01:48.522 --> 01:01:51.750
What's all this?
- From boys who read about your camp.

01:01:51.859 --> 01:01:53.586
Already? All these letter...

01:01:53.694 --> 01:01:56.888
Those are only local. Wait till they
start pouring in from all over.

01:01:56.997 --> 01:02:01.397
You mean... I'd better open one up.
Let's see what they say here.

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.933
Look, there's money.
Let me see.

01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:09.031
"Dear Senator Smith...

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:12.474
...I'd like to come to camp.
I shine shoes at the station.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.330
Here's 9 cents."
Isnâ€™t that wonderful?

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:20.248
And he signs it, "Yours truly,
Stinky Moore."

01:02:20.354 --> 01:02:22.081
Isn't that marvelous?

01:02:22.189 --> 01:02:26.623
If there's money in each one of these,
what will we do with it?

01:02:27.094 --> 01:02:28.923
A bank! That's perfect.

01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:33.361
You can see how important
this bill will be. Is there any paper?

01:02:33.467 --> 01:02:35.091
Second drawer.

01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:37.667
That's fine.
I'll be pretty busy tonight.

01:02:38.205 --> 01:02:39.966
Not another bill?

01:02:41.108 --> 01:02:43.676
Letters. I'm busting with news!

01:02:43.777 --> 01:02:45.674
I introduced a bill.
Me, Jeff Smith!

01:02:45.779 --> 01:02:47.369
I spoke in the Senate!

01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:51.073
Want to dictate them?
- The letters? I couldn't talk letters.

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:53.378
I'll sit here
and scratch them down.

01:02:53.487 --> 01:02:54.587
And say...

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:58.087
...I'm going to tell Ma all about you.

01:02:58.192 --> 01:03:03.127
And if I tell it right, you'll get the
best jar of preserves you ever tasted.

01:03:03.264 --> 01:03:05.355
Thank you very much.

01:03:06.767 --> 01:03:09.893
Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.

01:03:10.004 --> 01:03:11.469
Don't mention it.

01:03:13.841 --> 01:03:16.569
Without you, I couldn't have, I mean....

01:03:22.683 --> 01:03:23.725
Who?

01:03:23.825 --> 01:03:24.909
Susan Paine.

01:03:25.386 --> 01:03:28.546
How do you do?
Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead.

01:03:28.656 --> 01:03:31.623
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you've got to help me.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:34.988
I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith
from the Senate tomorrow.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.333
You're what?

01:03:40.433 --> 01:03:44.131
I'm to turn my glamour on for him.
You sympathize, don't you?

01:03:44.271 --> 01:03:45.463
Awkward, isn't it?

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.641
Take him out and buy him
a suit of clothes that fits...

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:51.037
...and a hat that he can hang on to.

01:03:51.145 --> 01:03:54.339
And a manicure and a haircut
wouldn't do any harm.

01:03:54.448 --> 01:03:58.143
As one woman to another,
I hate to ask you to do this, but....

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:00.286
As one woman to another, of course.

01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:01.613
Thanks, and...

01:04:01.722 --> 01:04:03.050
Just a minute.

01:04:03.657 --> 01:04:05.190
Miss Paine.

01:04:07.061 --> 01:04:08.628
Susan Paine?

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:11.854
She wants to talk to me?

01:04:12.733 --> 01:04:14.232
What does she...?

01:04:16.136 --> 01:04:17.726
Holy mackerel.

01:04:21.008 --> 01:04:23.406
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?

01:04:24.378 --> 01:04:25.478
Yes.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.680
Fine.

01:04:29.683 --> 01:04:30.783
What?

01:04:34.688 --> 01:04:36.415
What? Escort you?

01:04:41.595 --> 01:04:43.686
I'd be delighted.

01:04:44.298 --> 01:04:45.729
All right.

01:04:46.266 --> 01:04:47.731
Reception for a princess?

01:04:48.235 --> 01:04:49.859
She wants me to...

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.435
Goodbye, Miss Paine.

01:04:52.106 --> 01:04:53.400
Goodbye.

01:04:53.507 --> 01:04:56.098
What do you know?
A reception for a princess.

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:58.505
- Can you imagine?
- Get your hat.

01:04:58.612 --> 01:05:01.806
We have a lot of shopping to do
before tomorrow.

01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:04.974
Where are your bitters?

01:05:05.085 --> 01:05:08.018
In the thing there.
Behind the thing.

01:05:08.288 --> 01:05:11.323
I don't mind who gets licked
in a fair fight.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.324
It's these clouts below the belt
I can't take.

01:05:16.597 --> 01:05:20.827
Siccing that horrible dame on him
when he's goofy about her.

01:05:21.802 --> 01:05:22.852
What dame?

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.003
Paine.

01:05:26.707 --> 01:05:28.172
Better be nice to her.

01:05:28.275 --> 01:05:30.935
Her dad's the party choice
for the White House.

01:05:31.045 --> 01:05:34.046
She may be the next
First Lady of the land.

01:05:34.581 --> 01:05:38.447
Imagine reading "My Day"
by Susan "Paine-In-The-Neck."

01:05:39.219 --> 01:05:42.811
He isn't going to be hurt enough.
She has to twist a knife in him too.

01:05:42.923 --> 01:05:44.650
The regal jackass.

01:05:44.758 --> 01:05:47.053
"I'll turn my glamour on him,"
she says.

01:05:47.161 --> 01:05:48.353
What's it to you?

01:05:48.462 --> 01:05:50.325
Nothing. I'm just saying...

01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:52.123
Then stop worrying.

01:05:52.232 --> 01:05:54.994
I told you, the dopes
will inherit the earth.

01:05:55.135 --> 01:05:59.729
I wonder if this Don Quixote
hasn't got the jump on all of us.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.532
If it isn't a curse to go
through life wised up like you and me.

01:06:03.644 --> 01:06:07.942
If you're going to wonder,
let's go down and do it over a steak.

01:06:08.415 --> 01:06:11.075
Come on, snap out of it.
Drink up!

01:06:11.185 --> 01:06:13.116
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:16.145
And to Don Quixote.

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:18.981
Do you know how I felt?

01:06:19.093 --> 01:06:21.127
How did you feel? Quick.

01:06:21.795 --> 01:06:23.920
I felt just like a mother.

01:06:24.665 --> 01:06:28.394
Sending her kid off to school
for the first time.

01:06:29.236 --> 01:06:34.205
Watching the little fellow
toddling off in his best bib and tucker.

01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:37.709
Hoping he can stand up
to the other kids.

01:06:42.616 --> 01:06:44.809
Say, who started this?

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.884
I'm just waiting for a streetcar.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.553
Well, cut it out, see?

01:06:53.026 --> 01:06:54.388
Who cares, anyway?

01:06:55.696 --> 01:06:57.058
I apologize.

01:06:57.164 --> 01:06:58.356
All right, then.

01:07:00.367 --> 01:07:04.096
After all, what's it to me?
So they drop him out of a balloon.

01:07:04.204 --> 01:07:06.738
All I care is,
I don't want to be around.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.500
I'm squeamish, see?
That's what I am.

01:07:11.578 --> 01:07:12.678
No, sir.

01:07:13.213 --> 01:07:16.180
I don't have to take it.
I won't be party to murder.

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:18.317
I'm going to quit.
I'm through.

01:07:18.418 --> 01:07:20.918
Again?
It's a good idea.

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:35.467
Let's get married.

01:07:35.669 --> 01:07:37.498
It's a good idea.

01:07:38.038 --> 01:07:39.122
When?

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.398
Anytime.

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:42.241
Tonight?

01:07:43.577 --> 01:07:44.803
You don't mind?

01:07:45.445 --> 01:07:46.978
I'd cherish you.

01:07:49.783 --> 01:07:51.350
You're a good egg, Diz.

01:07:51.451 --> 01:07:52.813
I know.

01:07:53.587 --> 01:07:56.087
Maybe we could clear out of this town.

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:58.451
Get to feel like people.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:02.622
Live like we just got out of a tunnel.

01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:05.321
- Tunnel?
- A tunnel.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:09.735
You've never seen prairie grass...

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:13.269
...with the wind leaning on it,
have you, Diz?

01:08:13.373 --> 01:08:16.237
Does the wind get tired out there?

01:08:18.245 --> 01:08:20.813
Or angry little mountain streams...

01:08:21.915 --> 01:08:24.813
...or the sun moving
against the cattle?

01:08:25.886 --> 01:08:29.353
You've never seen anything like that,
have you, Diz?

01:08:30.157 --> 01:08:31.451
Have you?

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.490
Do we have to?

01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:42.158
I can't think of anything more sappy.

01:08:42.603 --> 01:08:44.136
Then let's get going.

01:08:44.238 --> 01:08:45.337
Where?

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.839
We're getting married.

01:08:47.941 --> 01:08:49.975
That's right.

01:08:51.645 --> 01:08:55.875
In case you don't know, I want to
give you a chance to back out.

01:08:55.983 --> 01:08:57.024
What?

01:08:57.124 --> 01:08:58.981
My first name's Clarissa.

01:08:59.086 --> 01:09:00.653
I know. It's okay.

01:09:01.622 --> 01:09:04.953
Don't say "okay."
Say you think it's beautiful.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.921
Okay. I mean...

01:09:07.027 --> 01:09:11.063
You don't know any name offhand
that you like better, do you?

01:09:11.163 --> 01:09:12.629
Not offhand.

01:09:12.733 --> 01:09:15.063
Nothing like "Susan" or anything?

01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:16.268
Susan?

01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:20.462
I won't take it, see?

01:09:20.774 --> 01:09:22.899
I won't be party to murder, see?

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:27.706
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys
for that Taylor mob is low enough...

01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:30.576
...but helping that dame
cut him in little bits...

01:09:30.684 --> 01:09:33.344
...nobody's going to make me do that!
No, sir.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.787
You said it.

01:09:34.886 --> 01:09:38.322
I'm going to get out of there right now.
Right now.

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.993
Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:44.185
Everything I own.
My extra hat, everything.

01:09:44.865 --> 01:09:45.965
Wait a minute.

01:09:46.066 --> 01:09:48.157
We're getting married!

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:49.763
See you later.

01:09:56.576 --> 01:09:57.676
Saunders?

01:10:05.752 --> 01:10:07.046
What do you want?

01:10:07.154 --> 01:10:09.722
- You should have been there.
- I know.

01:10:09.823 --> 01:10:12.858
It was a wonderful party, and
your suit went over big...

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:14.788
...and she looked beautiful.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.756
And when you left she said...

01:10:16.863 --> 01:10:18.624
..."Thank you, Mr. Smith."

01:10:18.732 --> 01:10:23.098
But it was the way she said it.
You nearly fell through the floor.

01:10:23.203 --> 01:10:24.497
Horseradish.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:36.780
What are you looking at?
You didn't think I was a lady, did you?

01:10:36.883 --> 01:10:38.780
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.

01:10:38.885 --> 01:10:41.613
Even I can't take it anymore. I quit.

01:10:41.722 --> 01:10:43.813
There's a lot I can't take.

01:10:43.924 --> 01:10:45.821
Can't take a simple...

01:10:48.929 --> 01:10:51.088
Why don't you go home?

01:10:51.298 --> 01:10:55.164
Tell your little streams about your camp
and the land of the free.

01:10:55.268 --> 01:10:58.531
This is no place for you.
You're halfway decent.

01:10:58.638 --> 01:10:59.932
Now go home!

01:11:00.374 --> 01:11:02.840
That's all I wanted to tell you.

01:11:03.643 --> 01:11:05.768
Meet the man I'm going to marry.

01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:09.880
That's me.

01:11:11.385 --> 01:11:14.386
Say something.
Don't just stand there like a...

01:11:16.123 --> 01:11:17.554
Wait a minute.

01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:20.095
Why don't I do this right?

01:11:20.536 --> 01:11:24.094
So you want to be a senator?
Build a camp on Willet Creek?

01:11:24.206 --> 01:11:25.306
See this?

01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:26.872
Deficiency bill.

01:11:26.976 --> 01:11:31.103
Section 40. A dam going up where you
think your camp will be.

01:11:31.213 --> 01:11:33.508
Ever hear of it?

01:11:33.616 --> 01:11:37.083
They read about it in the Senate today,
but you didn't hear.

01:11:37.186 --> 01:11:39.777
That's why that ritzy dame
took you in tow.

01:11:39.889 --> 01:11:44.255
That's why they sent you here.
You don't know a dam from a bathtub.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.485
Go ahead.
Be a senator.

01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:49.596
Try and mess up
Mr. Taylor's little graft.

01:11:49.698 --> 01:11:51.356
But if you can't...

01:11:51.467 --> 01:11:54.536
...and you can't in 9 million years...

01:11:55.037 --> 01:11:59.198
Go home! Don't stay around here
making people feel sorry for you.

01:12:00.543 --> 01:12:01.974
Come on, Diz.

01:12:07.349 --> 01:12:09.007
Hey! This way.

01:12:12.922 --> 01:12:16.389
Come on, kid.
We'll dig up a preacher.

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.523
We're going to get married.

01:12:28.737 --> 01:12:31.237
Come on, I'll take you home.

01:12:39.114 --> 01:12:42.976
There are 100 other places in the state
that really need the water.

01:12:43.118 --> 01:12:47.245
Kenneth Allen owns some land there.
He didn't mention a dam.

01:12:47.356 --> 01:12:50.584
There's something wrong here.
I know there is.

01:12:50.693 --> 01:12:53.762
I won't vote on it till I get
some questions answered.

01:12:53.862 --> 01:12:56.453
- Jeff, you're fighting windmills.
- I am?

01:12:56.565 --> 01:13:00.066
Trying to understand everything about
a project that took two years to set up.

01:13:00.169 --> 01:13:03.898
- The reasons, the benefits.
- The benefits? Who is Taylor?

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:06.506
What's he got to do with this?

01:13:06.609 --> 01:13:09.507
What makes you think
he's got anything to do with it?

01:13:09.678 --> 01:13:13.043
I've heard that this is all
his idea to get graft.

01:13:15.584 --> 01:13:17.584
Do you know what you're saying?

01:13:17.686 --> 01:13:21.586
You're accusing me of framing a bill
for one individual's benefit.

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:24.691
Of helping to put through
a scheme for graft.

01:13:25.527 --> 01:13:26.821
Long distance?

01:13:26.929 --> 01:13:29.259
Get me James Taylor, Jackson City.

01:13:29.465 --> 01:13:32.056
Boy Ranger, eh? Answer to a prayer?
Manna from heaven.

01:13:32.167 --> 01:13:34.064
Didn't even know how to tell time.

01:13:34.169 --> 01:13:36.430
Will you tell me
exactly what he's done?

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:39.471
He's about to blow the machine
to smithereens, and you with it.

01:13:39.575 --> 01:13:41.336
Me, Jim? How?

01:13:41.443 --> 01:13:43.443
You wouldn't understand that.

01:13:43.545 --> 01:13:46.876
Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs,
I'm on my way to Washington.

01:13:46.982 --> 01:13:51.746
No matter what happens, I'm all ready
for that Boy Ranger of yours.

01:13:51.854 --> 01:13:54.013
Take your instructions
from Ken Allen.

01:13:54.123 --> 01:13:56.623
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp.

01:13:56.725 --> 01:13:59.453
Use your high office to help Alan
get things done.

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:01.856
Do you understand?

01:14:01.964 --> 01:14:03.497
I doubt it.
Come on, Alan.

01:14:04.099 --> 01:14:08.431
I haven't been able to show him a single
monument. Not even one that high.

01:14:08.537 --> 01:14:11.902
No, he's been on our tail.
You've got to keep this guy off of us.

01:14:12.007 --> 01:14:16.009
Ever since he found out we represent
the Creek, he's been running us ragged.

01:14:16.111 --> 01:14:19.703
I told you I'd handle him.
I object to you coming here like this.

01:14:19.882 --> 01:14:21.609
You proved how you can handle him.

01:14:21.717 --> 01:14:24.411
You're the one that started him
writing bills.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.246
Chick, let him in.

01:14:26.355 --> 01:14:30.391
- You didn't ask Smith here?
What do you think?

01:14:30.492 --> 01:14:33.390
Don't open that door.
Jim, you can't do this.

01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:36.497
Let him in, Chick.

01:14:36.732 --> 01:14:38.390
All right, Jim.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.067
You can count me out.

01:14:43.305 --> 01:14:45.703
Good morning, senator.
Come right in.

01:14:52.114 --> 01:14:54.375
What did you mean, count you out?

01:14:54.483 --> 01:14:57.450
You can't come here and
pull that steamroller stuff.

01:14:57.553 --> 01:14:59.416
Your methods won't do here.

01:14:59.521 --> 01:15:02.215
He's a senator.
However it happened, he's a senator.

01:15:02.324 --> 01:15:03.618
This is Washington.

01:15:03.726 --> 01:15:07.592
Steamroller stuff?
My methods don't go in Washington?

01:15:07.696 --> 01:15:09.195
They've done well by you.

01:15:09.298 --> 01:15:13.129
That's beside the point.
This boy's different. He's honest.

01:15:13.235 --> 01:15:15.803
He thinks the world of me.
We can't do it!

01:15:15.904 --> 01:15:19.770
What am I supposed to do? Stand around
and let that drooling infant...

01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:23.604
...wrap that Willet Creek Dam
appropriation around my neck?

01:15:23.712 --> 01:15:25.245
Not me.

01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:28.815
Either he falls in line with us...

01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:32.748
...or I'll break him so wide open
they'll never find the pieces.

01:15:32.855 --> 01:15:35.685
Jim, I won't stand for it.

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.415
You won't stand for it?

01:15:37.526 --> 01:15:40.720
I don't want any part
of crucifying this boy.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.358
I see.

01:15:43.832 --> 01:15:48.869
Our steamroller methods are too hard
for your sensitive soul. Is that it?

01:15:49.738 --> 01:15:52.807
The Silver Knight
is getting too big for us.

01:15:54.243 --> 01:15:57.278
My methods have been all right
for the past 20 years.

01:15:57.379 --> 01:16:00.175
Since I picked you
out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall...

01:16:00.282 --> 01:16:02.509
...and made you look like a senator.

01:16:02.618 --> 01:16:04.549
And now you can't stand it?

01:16:04.653 --> 01:16:07.187
Maybe you don't have to stand it.

01:16:07.289 --> 01:16:10.586
Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy
can go home together.

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:14.592
- You don't have to...
- It's all right, it's all right.

01:16:15.831 --> 01:16:20.061
Seems a shame, though, to part company
like this after all these years.

01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:24.228
Especially now, with a national
convention coming up.

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:28.371
Joe, I put everything I have
behind you.

01:16:28.477 --> 01:16:30.670
And so did all of our friends.

01:16:31.814 --> 01:16:33.541
I guess we'll survive.

01:16:33.816 --> 01:16:37.511
We'll just find somebody else
who's got a little more sense.

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:42.452
In the meantime, you go in and
explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.

01:16:42.558 --> 01:16:45.058
It's your bill. It's your reputation.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.820
If he can't find enough facts
to break you with...

01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:51.090
...send him to me.
I'll give him a couple of good ones.

01:16:51.366 --> 01:16:54.902
I'm taking the next plane home.
So long.

01:17:02.344 --> 01:17:03.843
Come here, will you?

01:17:13.488 --> 01:17:15.749
It's just that I like the kid.

01:17:16.491 --> 01:17:18.923
I don't want to see you
get too rough on him.

01:17:20.462 --> 01:17:22.689
I'm glad you came to your senses.

01:17:22.798 --> 01:17:25.423
You had me scared there for a minute.

01:17:25.534 --> 01:17:29.331
Go back to your office. I'll call you
when I get through with Smith.

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:44.411
"The Silver Knight."

01:17:50.592 --> 01:17:51.625
Hello, senator.

01:17:51.725 --> 01:17:54.992
I was just passing through.
I thought I'd like to meet you.

01:17:55.097 --> 01:17:57.597
Sit down. You met all
the boys here, I suppose.

01:17:57.699 --> 01:18:00.529
They say you've been
on your toes since you got here.

01:18:00.636 --> 01:18:02.226
That's fine.

01:18:02.938 --> 01:18:06.166
You know, some people told me
that you were dumb.

01:18:06.275 --> 01:18:07.865
I think you're smart.

01:18:07.976 --> 01:18:10.510
You're smart enough
to understand a situation...

01:18:10.612 --> 01:18:12.805
- ...when it's explained to you.
- Like what?

01:18:12.915 --> 01:18:14.778
Well, for instance...

01:18:14.883 --> 01:18:16.678
...building a dam on Willet Creek.

01:18:16.785 --> 01:18:18.910
Just what's your interest in this?

01:18:19.021 --> 01:18:20.520
What's my interest?

01:18:22.457 --> 01:18:25.754
Anything that benefits the state
is mighty important to me.

01:18:25.861 --> 01:18:29.453
Owning a lot of its industry,
newspapers and other odds and ends.

01:18:29.564 --> 01:18:33.498
If I felt you had the welfare
of the state at heart like I have...

01:18:33.602 --> 01:18:36.364
...I'd say you were a man to watch.

01:18:37.239 --> 01:18:38.738
Now, what do you like?

01:18:39.074 --> 01:18:40.141
Business?

01:18:40.241 --> 01:18:42.367
If you do, you can pick any job...

01:18:42.477 --> 01:18:44.272
...in the state and go to the top.

01:18:44.446 --> 01:18:45.774
Or politics.

01:18:46.448 --> 01:18:50.541
If you like being senator, there's
no reason why you can't come back...

01:18:50.652 --> 01:18:52.811
...and stay there
as long as you want.

01:18:52.921 --> 01:18:54.886
If you're smart.

01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:57.388
Now, you take the boys here,
or Joe Paine.

01:18:57.492 --> 01:18:59.184
They're doing all right.

01:18:59.294 --> 01:19:01.123
They don't have to worry about...

01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:03.422
...being re-elected or anything else.

01:19:03.532 --> 01:19:04.599
They're smart.

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:06.597
They take my advice.

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:10.732
You tell these men
and Senator Paine what to do?

01:19:10.839 --> 01:19:12.031
Why, yes.

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.471
Joe Paine has been taking my advice
for the past 20 years.

01:19:17.779 --> 01:19:19.346
You're a liar.

01:19:28.623 --> 01:19:30.520
I've got to see Senator Paine.

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:32.420
Senator Paine is out of town.

01:19:32.527 --> 01:19:34.618
Out of town?
He couldn't be.

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.427
Hello, Jeff.
Come in.

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:43.933
Did you have a talk with Taylor?

01:19:44.439 --> 01:19:46.632
He said he's told you
what to do for 20 years.

01:19:46.742 --> 01:19:48.707
I called him a liar.

01:19:49.444 --> 01:19:51.409
Come over here and sit down.

01:19:51.513 --> 01:19:53.672
I don't feel like sitting down.

01:19:53.949 --> 01:19:55.983
Oh, I know how you feel.

01:19:57.386 --> 01:19:59.954
I was hoping you'd be
spared all this.

01:20:00.522 --> 01:20:02.453
I was hoping that you would...

01:20:02.557 --> 01:20:05.888
...see the sights, absorb some history,
and go back to your boys.

01:20:05.994 --> 01:20:09.655
You've been living in a boy's world.
For heaven's sake, stay there.

01:20:09.765 --> 01:20:10.991
This is a man's world.

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.996
It's brutal,
and you've no place in it.

01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:16.967
You'll only get hurt. Take my advice.
Forget Taylor and what he said.

01:20:17.072 --> 01:20:19.072
Forget you ever heard
of Willet Creek Dam.

01:20:19.174 --> 01:20:21.469
But you still haven't
answered me, sir.

01:20:21.576 --> 01:20:25.874
Can a man like Taylor tell you
and those other men what to do?

01:20:27.382 --> 01:20:29.575
Listen, Jeff, please...

01:20:30.085 --> 01:20:31.846
...and try to understand.

01:20:31.987 --> 01:20:34.885
I know it's tough to run
head-on into facts.

01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:38.457
This is a man's world,
and you got to check your ideals...

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.254
...outside the door,
like you do your rubbers.

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:45.193
Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals.

01:20:46.068 --> 01:20:47.465
I was you.

01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:51.431
I had to make the same decision
you were asked to make today.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.937
And I made it.

01:20:53.942 --> 01:20:55.509
I compromised.

01:20:56.578 --> 01:21:01.513
So I could sit in that Senate and
serve the people in 1000 honest ways.

01:21:01.983 --> 01:21:03.778
You got to face facts.

01:21:04.086 --> 01:21:06.177
I've served our state well,
haven't l?

01:21:06.288 --> 01:21:09.983
We have the lowest unemployment
and the highest federal grants.

01:21:10.559 --> 01:21:12.354
But I've had to compromise.

01:21:12.461 --> 01:21:15.291
I've had to play ball.
You can't count on people voting.

01:21:15.397 --> 01:21:17.795
Half the time
they don't vote, anyway.

01:21:17.899 --> 01:21:21.867
That's how states and empires have been
built since time began, understand?

01:21:28.276 --> 01:21:31.402
You can take my word for it.
That's how things are.

01:21:34.649 --> 01:21:36.842
I've told you all this because...

01:21:37.652 --> 01:21:39.947
...I've grown very fond of you.

01:21:40.489 --> 01:21:42.887
About like a son, in fact.

01:21:43.758 --> 01:21:46.349
And I don't want to
see you get hurt.

01:21:47.262 --> 01:21:52.231
When that deficiency bill comes up
tomorrow, don't say a word.

01:21:52.334 --> 01:21:55.699
Great powers are behind it,
who'll destroy you before you start.

01:21:55.804 --> 01:21:57.394
For your own sake...

01:21:57.806 --> 01:22:00.898
...and for the sake of
my friendship with your father...

01:22:01.009 --> 01:22:02.167
...please...

01:22:03.145 --> 01:22:05.236
...don't say a word.

01:22:12.621 --> 01:22:15.315
Owing to the urgency
of the deficiency bill...

01:22:15.423 --> 01:22:17.582
...there is a unanimous
consent agreement...

01:22:17.692 --> 01:22:21.159
...that no one will speak more than once
or longer than five minutes...

01:22:21.263 --> 01:22:23.593
...on any section of the bill.

01:22:24.032 --> 01:22:25.258
Clerk will read.

01:22:26.568 --> 01:22:30.900
"The bill for deficiency appropriations
for the fiscal year, Section One.

01:22:31.006 --> 01:22:32.368
On emergency relief:

01:22:32.474 --> 01:22:35.543
To create and erect
public improvements on rivers...

01:22:35.644 --> 01:22:37.735
...harbors and roadways,
$150 billion.

01:22:38.346 --> 01:22:39.396
Section 40:

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:42.539
An appropriation to divert
and impound Willet Creek...

01:22:42.651 --> 01:22:45.413
...to the natural basin
of Terry Canyon, $5 million."

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.620
Mr. President?

01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:49.985
Senator Smith desires
to be heard on Section 40?

01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:51.191
I do, sir.

01:22:51.326 --> 01:22:54.088
The senator understands
he's limited to five minutes?

01:22:54.196 --> 01:22:55.296
Yes, sir.

01:22:55.864 --> 01:22:57.329
You may proceed, sir.

01:22:58.433 --> 01:23:01.969
Mr. President, this section of the bill,
this dam on Willet Creek...

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:03.569
...is nothing but...

01:23:03.972 --> 01:23:07.041
Does Senator Smith wish to
yield to his colleague?

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:09.443
Why, yes, sir.

01:23:09.543 --> 01:23:11.068
You may proceed, senator.

01:23:11.179 --> 01:23:12.405
Mr. President...

01:23:12.781 --> 01:23:15.179
...I have risen to a difficult task...

01:23:15.283 --> 01:23:18.216
...to say from evidence
that has come to my attention...

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.321
...I consider Senator Smith
unworthy to address this body.

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.484
You boys go out
and get the senators.

01:23:27.495 --> 01:23:29.961
Something going on inside,
come on.

01:23:33.768 --> 01:23:37.065
The senator will suspend
until order is restored.

01:23:37.539 --> 01:23:40.233
All senators are
wanted on the floor, please.

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.639
What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:23:59.995 --> 01:24:01.289
You may proceed.

01:24:01.396 --> 01:24:02.724
I refer to the bill...

01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:06.765
...he has introduced for
the creation of a national boys' camp.

01:24:06.868 --> 01:24:10.062
He named a portion of land
to be dedicated to that purpose...

01:24:10.171 --> 01:24:14.332
...and to be bought by contributions
from boys all over America.

01:24:14.442 --> 01:24:15.600
Senators...

01:24:16.211 --> 01:24:20.941
...I have evidence to prove my colleague
owns the land described in his bill.

01:24:25.687 --> 01:24:28.756
He bought it the day after his
appointment to the Senate...

01:24:28.857 --> 01:24:29.898
...and is holding it...

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:33.460
...using his privileged office
for his own personal profit!

01:24:39.668 --> 01:24:41.463
Boy Ranger had a wreck.

01:24:41.569 --> 01:24:43.159
This doesn't make sense.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.164
Accordingly...

01:24:46.775 --> 01:24:48.240
...I offer a resolution...

01:24:48.343 --> 01:24:51.606
...an inquiry by the Committee
of Privileges and Elections...

01:24:51.713 --> 01:24:53.280
...as to the fitness
of my colleague...

01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:55.381
...to continue to
sit in this chamber.

01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:03.290
Order!

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:07.152
Chairman, clear the galleries
unless order is restored.

01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:14.428
Flash! Ranger senator
branded by colleague.

01:25:14.536 --> 01:25:16.968
Flash! Paine brings charges
to expel Smith.

01:25:17.072 --> 01:25:19.265
Where's Saunders?
- She'll have the lowdown.

01:25:19.374 --> 01:25:22.307
I wish I knew. She left town
in that jalopy of hers.

01:25:23.044 --> 01:25:27.308
Paine accuses Smith of introducing
a boys' camp built for his own profit.

01:25:27.415 --> 01:25:28.448
Give me a cigarette.

01:25:28.548 --> 01:25:31.348
Paine's asked for a hearing
before the Committee.

01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:36.450
Well, frankly, my dear senators...

01:25:36.558 --> 01:25:39.525
...the morning that Mr. Allen
burst into my office...

01:25:39.627 --> 01:25:43.458
...bringing proof that Smith
had the deed to that campsite...

01:25:43.565 --> 01:25:44.893
...I was dumbfounded!

01:25:44.999 --> 01:25:48.796
Pardon me, what did you do when
this was brought to your attention?

01:25:48.903 --> 01:25:51.870
I consulted with the head
of the Department of Records...

01:25:51.973 --> 01:25:53.506
...Mr. Arthur Kim.

01:25:53.808 --> 01:25:56.809
Mr. Kim, do you remember
recording such a deed?

01:25:58.179 --> 01:26:01.339
On the date set forth here,
Mr. Allen came before me...

01:26:01.449 --> 01:26:02.914
...to record this deed...

01:26:03.017 --> 01:26:06.211
...setting over 200 acres
in the name of Jefferson Smith.

01:26:06.488 --> 01:26:09.455
How long have you known
Senator Smith, Mr. Allen?

01:26:09.557 --> 01:26:11.454
Oh, a good many years.

01:26:11.559 --> 01:26:15.891
He used my land by Willet Creek
every summer for his Boy Rangers.

01:26:15.997 --> 01:26:17.689
Seemed like a mighty nice fellow.

01:26:17.799 --> 01:26:19.457
One day he made a proposition.

01:26:19.567 --> 01:26:23.068
Said he had a chance to sell that land
for at least $500 an acre.

01:26:23.171 --> 01:26:26.798
I'd be glad to get 25 for it.
So we set it up like this:

01:26:26.908 --> 01:26:29.772
I deeded him the land, and he gave me a
contract...

01:26:29.878 --> 01:26:32.572
...guaranteeing me half,
if he made the sale.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.008
Mind you now...

01:26:34.115 --> 01:26:36.308
...the whole thing
sounded fishy at the time.

01:26:36.418 --> 01:26:38.850
That contract you mentioned...

01:26:38.953 --> 01:26:40.020
...have you got it?

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.622
That land wouldn't be
in his name if I didn't.

01:26:42.724 --> 01:26:44.815
Yes, sir.
Signed and delivered.

01:26:44.926 --> 01:26:47.017
I never signed any such contract!

01:26:47.128 --> 01:26:48.252
He certainly did!

01:26:48.363 --> 01:26:49.930
Just a moment, please.

01:26:53.301 --> 01:26:57.997
After a long study of this signature,
it is my professional opinion...

01:26:58.106 --> 01:27:01.903
...that it is definitely in
Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.

01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:04.010
As an expert on handwriting...

01:27:04.112 --> 01:27:08.649
...I'd say the name of Jefferson
Smith on this contract has been forged.

01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:12.752
I would stake my whole 20 years
professional career...

01:27:12.854 --> 01:27:16.185
...on the fact that
this is not a forgery...

01:27:16.291 --> 01:27:20.020
...but is Mr. Smith's own signature.

01:27:20.161 --> 01:27:22.456
This is a very painful
duty for me.

01:27:22.564 --> 01:27:24.689
This boy's the son
of my very best friend.

01:27:24.799 --> 01:27:27.834
I sponsored him in the Senate.
I helped frame his bill.

01:27:27.936 --> 01:27:30.630
When he presented it,
I went to congratulate him...

01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:33.238
...but pointed out
a dam was already going up...

01:27:33.341 --> 01:27:35.966
...on the very site
he'd chosen for his camp.

01:27:36.077 --> 01:27:38.771
There are other
good campsites nearby...

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.914
...so I suggested he choose another.

01:27:41.115 --> 01:27:42.477
He became furious.

01:27:42.584 --> 01:27:44.413
He said, "Move the dam."

01:27:44.519 --> 01:27:47.611
I was amazed at his violent reaction.
I couldn't understand.

01:27:47.722 --> 01:27:51.849
Until the evidence came to me that
he owned those very 200 acres.

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.084
And as you have heard...

01:27:53.194 --> 01:27:56.559
...had carefully laid plans
to make an enormous profit...

01:27:56.664 --> 01:28:01.633
...out of the nickels and dimes scraped
together by the boys of this country.

01:28:01.836 --> 01:28:03.096
Faced with that...

01:28:04.105 --> 01:28:07.003
...regardless of my
personal feelings for the boy...

01:28:07.108 --> 01:28:10.837
...my sense of duty told me his
expulsion from the Senate...

01:28:10.945 --> 01:28:12.876
...was the only possible answer.

01:28:12.981 --> 01:28:15.106
Beautiful, that Taylor machine.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.181
Senator Smith, please.

01:28:25.193 --> 01:28:26.783
Will you take the chair, please?

01:28:38.373 --> 01:28:41.965
The Committee is ready
to hear you now, Senator Smith.

01:28:49.984 --> 01:28:51.642
Keep your seats, gentlemen!

01:28:51.786 --> 01:28:53.877
Committee is not adjourned yet.

01:28:53.988 --> 01:28:55.953
Quiet! Please!

01:28:59.027 --> 01:29:03.325
That Ranger never knew what struck
him when Jim Taylor opened up on him.

01:29:03.431 --> 01:29:05.624
Which one of you girls wants this?

01:29:08.937 --> 01:29:11.028
- Do you want it?
- Oh, yes.

01:30:51.372 --> 01:30:53.963
You know, I had a hunch
I'd find you here...

01:30:54.075 --> 01:30:55.733
...when you weren't anyplace else.

01:30:59.714 --> 01:31:01.111
How've you been, Saunders?

01:31:01.215 --> 01:31:02.509
Oh, all right.

01:31:03.518 --> 01:31:05.279
Your husband.
How's he?

01:31:06.988 --> 01:31:09.056
Old Diz.
We're not married.

01:31:13.695 --> 01:31:18.232
Good thing I got back just when I did.
You know what I found waiting for me?

01:31:18.833 --> 01:31:20.867
Jar of preserves from your mother.

01:31:20.968 --> 01:31:22.126
Oh, you did?

01:31:23.638 --> 01:31:25.296
What was it, strawberry?

01:31:26.574 --> 01:31:28.301
That's the best kind.

01:31:30.578 --> 01:31:33.647
I see by the papers
you certainly got to be a senator.

01:31:35.516 --> 01:31:38.414
You sure had the right idea
about me, Saunders.

01:31:38.519 --> 01:31:42.680
You told me to go back home and
keep filling those kids full of hooey.

01:31:44.225 --> 01:31:47.658
Just a simple guy, you said,
still wet behind the ears...

01:31:47.762 --> 01:31:50.092
...lot of junk about American ideals.

01:31:50.565 --> 01:31:53.361
That's certainly
a lot of junk, all right.

01:31:53.468 --> 01:31:56.469
- Now look, senator...
- I don't know...

01:31:56.771 --> 01:31:59.135
...this is a whole new world to me.

01:32:01.342 --> 01:32:03.273
What are you going to believe in...

01:32:04.245 --> 01:32:07.837
...when a man like Senator Joseph Paine
gets up and swears...

01:32:07.949 --> 01:32:11.507
...that I've been robbing
kids of nickels and dimes?

01:32:12.386 --> 01:32:15.512
A man I've admired
and worshiped all my life.

01:32:15.623 --> 01:32:16.951
I don't know.

01:32:17.525 --> 01:32:19.252
A lot of fancy words in this town.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.258
Some of them are carved in stone,
some of them....

01:32:22.363 --> 01:32:26.729
Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up
there so suckers like me can read them.

01:32:27.301 --> 01:32:30.165
Then when you find out
what men actually do....

01:32:30.605 --> 01:32:33.265
Well, I'm getting out
of this town so fast...

01:32:33.374 --> 01:32:37.342
...away from all the words and the
monuments and the whole rotten show.

01:32:38.179 --> 01:32:39.405
I see.

01:32:40.715 --> 01:32:43.340
When you get home,
what will you tell those kids?

01:32:43.718 --> 01:32:45.786
Well, I'll tell them the truth.

01:32:45.887 --> 01:32:48.512
Might as well find it out
now as later.

01:32:49.757 --> 01:32:52.087
I don't think they'll believe you.

01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:56.251
They're liable to look up at you
with hurt faces and say...

01:32:56.364 --> 01:32:58.728
..."Jeff, what did you do? Quit?

01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:00.628
Didn't you do something about it?"

01:33:01.068 --> 01:33:03.432
Well, what do you expect me to do?

01:33:04.138 --> 01:33:06.172
An honorary stooge
like me against...

01:33:06.274 --> 01:33:10.037
...the Taylors and Paines
and machines and lies.

01:33:10.344 --> 01:33:13.379
Your friend Mr. Lincoln
had his Taylors and Paines.

01:33:13.481 --> 01:33:17.449
So did every other man who tried
to lift his thought up off the ground.

01:33:17.552 --> 01:33:21.179
Odds against them didn't stop them,
they were fools that way.

01:33:21.289 --> 01:33:23.516
All the good that ever came
into this world...

01:33:23.624 --> 01:33:26.488
...came from fools with faith
like that. You know that.

01:33:26.961 --> 01:33:30.224
You can't quit now. Not you.

01:33:30.464 --> 01:33:32.828
They aren't all Taylors and Paines
in Washington.

01:33:32.934 --> 01:33:36.162
That kind just throw big shadows,
that's all.

01:33:36.571 --> 01:33:40.300
You didn't just have faith in Paine,
or any other living man.

01:33:40.408 --> 01:33:42.635
You had faith in something bigger.

01:33:42.743 --> 01:33:46.677
You had plain, decent,
everyday common rightness...

01:33:46.781 --> 01:33:49.714
...and this country
could use some of that.

01:33:50.384 --> 01:33:53.976
So could the whole cockeyed world.
A lot of it.

01:33:54.856 --> 01:33:56.753
Remember the first day
you got here?

01:33:56.858 --> 01:33:58.687
Remember what you said
about Mr. Lincoln?

01:33:58.793 --> 01:34:01.862
That he was waiting for
someone to come along?

01:34:01.963 --> 01:34:03.030
You were right.

01:34:03.130 --> 01:34:07.600
He was waiting for a man who could
see his job and sail into it.

01:34:07.702 --> 01:34:11.465
Who could tear into the Taylors
and root them out into the open.

01:34:11.572 --> 01:34:13.936
I think he was waiting for you.

01:34:14.041 --> 01:34:16.541
He knows you can do it.
So do l.

01:34:17.044 --> 01:34:19.009
What?
Do what, Saunders?

01:34:19.113 --> 01:34:22.512
You make up your mind you won't quit,
and I'll tell you what.

01:34:22.617 --> 01:34:25.083
Been thinking about it
all the way back here.

01:34:25.186 --> 01:34:29.620
It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water,
but I think you can do it.

01:34:36.831 --> 01:34:37.931
Clarissa...

01:34:38.866 --> 01:34:40.365
...where can we get a drink?

01:34:40.468 --> 01:34:41.568
Now you're talking.

01:34:41.736 --> 01:34:43.701
Come on over to my place.

01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:57.647
Mr. Dearborn.

01:34:57.952 --> 01:34:59.383
Mr. Dernell.

01:34:59.687 --> 01:35:01.152
Mr. Dwight.

01:35:01.656 --> 01:35:03.656
They're going to
expel Smith today, eh?

01:35:03.758 --> 01:35:06.224
Where are the drums?
Where's the guillotine?

01:35:06.327 --> 01:35:07.519
In fact, where's Smith?

01:35:07.628 --> 01:35:10.322
Hasn't stopped running
since he left the Committee.

01:35:10.431 --> 01:35:11.589
- Mr. Singleton.
- Here.

01:35:11.699 --> 01:35:12.732
Mr. Smith.

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:13.866
Here!

01:35:22.543 --> 01:35:23.837
That guy's batty.

01:35:23.945 --> 01:35:26.513
The clerk will continue
with the roll call.

01:35:28.849 --> 01:35:30.246
Here comes Saunders.

01:35:36.791 --> 01:35:38.756
Is this some of your shenanigan?

01:35:39.427 --> 01:35:40.460
What's the matter?

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.222
Pray, Diz,
if you know how.

01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:45.963
Did you have anything to do with
bringing him in here?

01:35:46.133 --> 01:35:47.723
Are you crazy?

01:35:49.937 --> 01:35:52.835
Ninety senators have answered
to their names.

01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.268
Quorum is present.

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:56.640
Proceeding now to the regular order.

01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:09.789
Mr. President.

01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:11.548
Senator MacPherson.

01:36:11.659 --> 01:36:15.354
I desire to call up the report
of the Committee...

01:36:15.463 --> 01:36:18.555
...on the expulsion
of Jefferson Smith.

01:36:21.702 --> 01:36:23.531
Clerk will read the report.

01:36:24.338 --> 01:36:26.406
"The Committee on Privileges
and Elections reports...

01:36:26.507 --> 01:36:29.167
...it appears to the satisfaction
of the Committee...

01:36:29.276 --> 01:36:31.367
...after hearing
a number of witnesses...

01:36:31.479 --> 01:36:33.809
...that justice
requires that Smith...

01:36:33.914 --> 01:36:36.175
...no longer continue
a member of this body.

01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:40.413
They report this resolution with
recommendation that the same do pass.

01:36:40.588 --> 01:36:44.920
Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be
expelled from his seat in the Senate."

01:36:51.899 --> 01:36:55.127
I move for the immediate
adoption of the resolution.

01:36:56.237 --> 01:36:58.498
- I addressed the chair first.
- I have the floor.

01:36:58.606 --> 01:37:00.640
I'm asking for
a roll call on the passage...

01:37:00.741 --> 01:37:02.672
...of the resolution
without further delay.

01:37:02.777 --> 01:37:05.744
The senator can have
nothing to say that would not...

01:37:07.248 --> 01:37:10.613
However, Senator Smith
is still a member of this body...

01:37:10.718 --> 01:37:14.049
...and has an equal claim
on the attention of this chair.

01:37:14.155 --> 01:37:15.552
You were about to recognize me.

01:37:15.656 --> 01:37:17.553
That was merely your impression.

01:37:17.658 --> 01:37:19.123
Let him speak!

01:37:23.931 --> 01:37:25.896
Before proceeding further...

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.366
...I remind the visitors in the gallery
they are here as our guests...

01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:32.387
...and should conduct
themselves as such.

01:37:32.487 --> 01:37:35.633
And I might add that their sentiments
in no way will affect...

01:37:35.743 --> 01:37:38.141
...the judgement of this chair.

01:37:43.717 --> 01:37:45.444
The chair recognizes...

01:37:47.421 --> 01:37:48.852
...Senator Smith.

01:37:51.525 --> 01:37:52.592
Thank you, sir.

01:37:52.692 --> 01:37:54.022
Diz, here we go.

01:37:54.495 --> 01:37:58.429
I guess the gentlemen are
in a big hurry to get me out of here.

01:37:58.933 --> 01:38:02.059
The way the evidence is piled up
against me, I can't blame them much.

01:38:02.169 --> 01:38:05.238
And I'm willing to go
when they vote it that way...

01:38:05.339 --> 01:38:08.420
...but before that happens,
I've got a few things to say.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:11.737
I tried to say them once before and l
got stopped colder than a mackerel.

01:38:11.846 --> 01:38:13.846
I'd like to get them said
this time.

01:38:13.948 --> 01:38:16.642
I'm not going to leave
until I do get them said.

01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:18.374
Will the senator yield?

01:38:18.486 --> 01:38:21.248
- Senator yields?
- No, sir, I'm afraid not!

01:38:21.889 --> 01:38:23.115
No, sir.

01:38:23.457 --> 01:38:27.391
I yielded the floor once before, and
I was practically never heard of again.

01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:28.921
No, sir.

01:38:29.864 --> 01:38:32.626
And we might as well all get together
on this "yielding" business...

01:38:32.733 --> 01:38:33.857
...right off the bat now.

01:38:37.404 --> 01:38:39.563
I had some pretty good
coaching last night...

01:38:39.673 --> 01:38:41.707
...and I find that if l
yield only for a question...

01:38:41.809 --> 01:38:44.139
...or point of order or personal
privilege, that I can...

01:38:44.245 --> 01:38:46.870
...hold this floor
almost until doomsday.

01:38:47.081 --> 01:38:49.308
In other words, I've got
a piece to speak...

01:38:49.416 --> 01:38:51.245
...and blow hot or cold,
I'm going to speak it.

01:38:51.352 --> 01:38:52.510
Will the senator yield?

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:54.415
Will Senator Smith yield?
- Yield how?

01:38:54.522 --> 01:38:56.590
Will he yield for a question?
- All right.

01:38:56.690 --> 01:38:58.724
I wish to ask my junior colleague...

01:38:58.826 --> 01:39:00.518
...this piece he intends to speak...

01:39:00.628 --> 01:39:03.595
...does it concern Section 40 of
that bill, the dam on Willet Creek?

01:39:03.697 --> 01:39:06.459
Every aspect of this matter,
everything...

01:39:06.567 --> 01:39:08.225
...was dealt with
in committee hearings.

01:39:08.335 --> 01:39:11.302
- Mr. President?
- I ask my distinguished colleague...

01:39:11.405 --> 01:39:13.234
...has he one scrap
of evidence to add now...

01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.806
...to the defense he did not give and
could not give at that same hearing?

01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:17.807
I have no defense
against forged papers!

01:39:17.912 --> 01:39:19.138
The committee ruled otherwise!

01:39:19.513 --> 01:39:22.605
The gentleman
stands guilty as charged.

01:39:23.017 --> 01:39:24.846
And I believe I speak
for every member...

01:39:24.952 --> 01:39:28.579
...when I say that no one cares to hear
what a man of his condemned character...

01:39:28.689 --> 01:39:32.281
...has to say about any section
of any legislation before this House!

01:39:32.393 --> 01:39:34.723
- Order, order, gentleman!
- Mr. President...

01:39:34.862 --> 01:39:38.557
...I stand guilty as framed because
Section 40 is graft.

01:39:38.732 --> 01:39:41.562
And I was ready to say so.
I was ready to tell you...

01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:44.169
...that a certain man in my state,
Mr. James Taylor...

01:39:44.271 --> 01:39:46.532
...wanted to put through this dam
for his own profit.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.800
A man who controls
a political machine...

01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:52.501
...and controls everything else
in my state.

01:39:52.613 --> 01:39:55.204
A man even powerful enough
to control congressmen.

01:39:55.316 --> 01:39:57.907
I saw three of them in his room
the day I went to see him.

01:39:58.018 --> 01:40:00.382
Will the senator yield?
- I will not yield!

01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:06.321
This same man,
James Taylor, came down here...

01:40:06.427 --> 01:40:08.927
...and offered me a seat
in this Senate for the next 20 years...

01:40:09.296 --> 01:40:13.162
...if I voted for a dam that he knew
and I knew was a fraud...

01:40:13.334 --> 01:40:15.834
...but if I dared to open
my mouth against that dam...

01:40:15.936 --> 01:40:17.526
...he promised to break me in two.

01:40:17.638 --> 01:40:20.502
I got up here and
I started to open my mouth...

01:40:20.608 --> 01:40:23.108
...and the long and powerful arm
of Mr. Taylor...

01:40:23.210 --> 01:40:26.905
...reached into this sacred chamber and
grabbed me by the scruff of the neck...

01:40:27.014 --> 01:40:28.342
Mr. President, a point of order.

01:40:28.449 --> 01:40:29.516
Mr. President?

01:40:29.616 --> 01:40:31.048
Senator Paine will state it.

01:40:31.352 --> 01:40:33.613
It was I who rose in this
chamber to accuse him.

01:40:33.721 --> 01:40:36.449
He's saying that I was carrying out
criminal orders on falsified evidence.

01:40:36.557 --> 01:40:39.671
He has imputed to me conduct
unworthy a senator, and I demand...

01:40:39.771 --> 01:40:41.691
...that he yield the floor.

01:40:41.795 --> 01:40:44.887
I did not say that Senator Paine was
one of the congressmen in that room!

01:40:44.999 --> 01:40:46.099
I was in that room!

01:40:48.269 --> 01:40:49.734
Order, gentlemen.

01:40:51.238 --> 01:40:53.169
I accuse this man.

01:40:53.274 --> 01:40:55.808
By his tone, by his careful
denials...

01:40:55.909 --> 01:40:59.206
...he is trying to plant
damaging impressions on my conduct.

01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:01.471
I'll tell you why
we were in that room.

01:41:01.582 --> 01:41:04.776
Because Mr. Taylor, a respected
citizen of our state...

01:41:04.885 --> 01:41:06.919
...had brought with him
the evidence against this man...

01:41:07.021 --> 01:41:08.952
...and we were urging him to resign.

01:41:09.056 --> 01:41:12.922
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace
upon a clean and honorable state.

01:41:13.027 --> 01:41:14.458
But he refused!

01:41:14.561 --> 01:41:15.603
Mr. President...

01:41:15.703 --> 01:41:17.843
There is only one answer
to a man like him.

01:41:17.943 --> 01:41:21.057
The truth, which I rose and gave
to this body.

01:41:22.102 --> 01:41:23.533
Mr. President...

01:41:23.637 --> 01:41:26.706
...he is trying to blackmail this
Senate as he tried to blackmail me.

01:41:26.807 --> 01:41:28.807
To prevent his expulsion, he'll
even try to...

01:41:28.909 --> 01:41:31.603
...hold up this Deficiency Bill,
vital to the country...

01:41:31.712 --> 01:41:33.780
...which must be passed
immediately!

01:41:33.881 --> 01:41:35.573
Have I the floor?

01:41:35.749 --> 01:41:38.909
I have lost all patience
with this brazen character.

01:41:39.019 --> 01:41:41.713
I apologize to this body
for his appointment.

01:41:41.989 --> 01:41:43.920
I regret I ever knew him.
I'm sick...

01:41:44.024 --> 01:41:45.421
...of this contemptible young man.

01:41:45.526 --> 01:41:48.891
And I refuse to stay here
and listen to him any longer.

01:41:49.063 --> 01:41:51.859
I hope every member
of this body feels as I do.

01:41:51.965 --> 01:41:54.226
Get off the floor! Yield the floor!

01:41:56.003 --> 01:41:57.263
Gentlemen!

01:41:57.371 --> 01:42:00.372
Gentlemen, please address the chair!

01:42:00.541 --> 01:42:03.371
Mr. President, what does
the gentleman want of this body?

01:42:03.477 --> 01:42:04.771
I'll tell you, sir!

01:42:04.878 --> 01:42:07.446
I want a chance to talk to people
who'll believe me.

01:42:07.548 --> 01:42:10.344
The people of my state, they know me
and they know Mr. Taylor.

01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:12.451
When they hear my story,
they'll rise up...

01:42:12.553 --> 01:42:15.281
...and kick Taylor's machine
to kingdom come.

01:42:15.389 --> 01:42:17.980
I want one week to go back there
and bring you proof.

01:42:18.092 --> 01:42:20.524
In the meantime, I want
this Senate's promise...

01:42:20.627 --> 01:42:23.457
...that I won't be expelled and
this bill will not be passed.

01:42:23.564 --> 01:42:25.393
Will the senator yield?
- For a question.

01:42:25.499 --> 01:42:29.228
Has the gentleman the effrontery to
stand, convicted and in disgrace...

01:42:29.336 --> 01:42:31.768
...and try to force postponement
of the Deficiency Bill?

01:42:31.872 --> 01:42:33.564
- For one week.
- Mr. President!

01:42:33.674 --> 01:42:35.435
I appeal to the senator.

01:42:35.542 --> 01:42:38.941
Is he fully aware that this bill
has been months in both Houses...

01:42:39.046 --> 01:42:40.807
...delayed and delayed?

01:42:40.914 --> 01:42:42.948
Millions will be
without food and shelter.

01:42:43.050 --> 01:42:45.277
Public works will be
at a standstill!

01:42:45.386 --> 01:42:46.748
Will we keep
relief from the country?

01:42:46.854 --> 01:42:48.387
The people of my state
need permanent relief...

01:42:48.489 --> 01:42:50.216
...from crooked men riding their backs!

01:42:50.324 --> 01:42:52.119
Mr. President, if the Senate yields...

01:42:52.226 --> 01:42:55.227
...to this sort to blackmail,
it'll become a laughingstock.

01:42:55.329 --> 01:42:57.624
It is an insult to this body
to have to listen.

01:42:57.731 --> 01:43:00.026
An insult to our colleague,
Senator Paine.

01:43:00.134 --> 01:43:02.202
I, for one, will follow
the senator's example...

01:43:02.302 --> 01:43:06.304
...and refuse to remain in this chamber
as long as that man holds the floor!

01:43:16.984 --> 01:43:18.608
Order, gentlemen!

01:43:19.953 --> 01:43:23.682
I guess I'll have to speak to
the people of my state from right here!

01:43:25.159 --> 01:43:26.283
I'll tell you...

01:43:26.393 --> 01:43:28.859
...wild horses won't drag me
off this floor until those...

01:43:28.962 --> 01:43:32.361
...people have heard everything I've
got to say, if it takes all winter!

01:43:38.472 --> 01:43:40.199
Filibuster!

01:43:54.087 --> 01:43:56.712
Well, Mr. President,
we seem to be alone.

01:43:58.826 --> 01:44:02.259
I'm not complaining
for social reason, it's just....

01:44:02.362 --> 01:44:06.626
I think it'd be a pity if these
gentlemen missed any of this. And....

01:44:21.181 --> 01:44:24.114
I call the chair's attention to...

01:44:26.587 --> 01:44:27.711
...to Rule Five...

01:44:27.821 --> 01:44:29.616
...of the Standing Rules of the Senate.

01:44:29.723 --> 01:44:31.654
Section... Section Three.

01:44:32.192 --> 01:44:34.760
"If it shall be found that
a quorum is not present...

01:44:34.862 --> 01:44:37.556
...a majority of
the senators present..."

01:44:38.165 --> 01:44:39.857
And that looks like me.

01:44:42.803 --> 01:44:46.270
"...may direct the sergeant at
arms to request, and if necessary...

01:44:46.373 --> 01:44:49.442
...compel the attendance
of the absent senators."

01:44:50.143 --> 01:44:52.575
Well, Mr. President, I so direct.

01:44:57.150 --> 01:45:00.276
The absence of a
quorum being suggested.

01:45:01.522 --> 01:45:03.715
- Bring the call to quorum.
- Call to quorum.

01:45:04.892 --> 01:45:08.018
There's no hurry, Mr. President.
I got plenty of time.

01:45:12.232 --> 01:45:14.960
Quorum call! Call to quorum!

01:45:22.576 --> 01:45:24.576
All senators wanted on the floor!

01:45:27.481 --> 01:45:29.481
Clerk will call the roll.

01:45:29.583 --> 01:45:31.674
- Mr. Agnew.
- Here.

01:45:31.785 --> 01:45:33.375
Mr. Albert.

01:45:33.487 --> 01:45:34.713
Mr. Alfred.

01:45:34.821 --> 01:45:36.479
- Mr. Ashman.
- Here.

01:45:36.957 --> 01:45:40.584
Joe, get this! Smith got the
floor and is holding it.

01:45:40.694 --> 01:45:42.159
Just as they were
about to kick him out!

01:45:42.262 --> 01:45:43.920
He did it, Diz. It's wonderful!

01:45:44.031 --> 01:45:45.564
It was terrific!

01:45:45.666 --> 01:45:48.997
A filibuster! This is the miracle l
wanted. What a yarn!

01:45:49.102 --> 01:45:51.329
Get everything
he says back to that home state.

01:45:51.438 --> 01:45:52.522
It's a pleasure!

01:45:52.622 --> 01:45:54.697
They're going
to hear this in Patagonia.

01:45:54.808 --> 01:45:57.536
In protest,
the whole Senate body walked out!

01:45:57.644 --> 01:45:59.541
Not that straight stuff.
Kick it up.

01:45:59.646 --> 01:46:01.737
Get on his side.
Fight for him, understand?

01:46:01.848 --> 01:46:03.347
You love this monkey, don't you?

01:46:03.450 --> 01:46:06.644
What do you think? Now
go to work. Do as I tell you.

01:46:06.887 --> 01:46:09.820
Take this: This is the most
titanic battle of modern times.

01:46:09.923 --> 01:46:12.491
A David without even a slingshot
rises to battle...

01:46:12.593 --> 01:46:14.684
...against the mighty Goliath,
the Taylor machine...

01:46:14.795 --> 01:46:17.523
...allegedly crooked inside and out.

01:46:18.198 --> 01:46:20.027
For my money
you can drop the "allegedly."

01:46:20.133 --> 01:46:21.757
We're bringing everybody up
from headquarters.

01:46:21.868 --> 01:46:24.801
Where are they? Come on,
get these telegraphs moving!

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.298
- You get Hendricks?
- They're looking for him.

01:46:28.408 --> 01:46:30.135
"They're looking for him." An editor.

01:46:30.243 --> 01:46:32.106
Why isn't he at his desk,
where he belongs?

01:46:32.212 --> 01:46:34.473
Don't you think you
better get back to that Senate?

01:46:34.581 --> 01:46:36.478
The boy's talking to that state.

01:46:36.583 --> 01:46:38.810
If he can raise public opinion
against us...

01:46:38.919 --> 01:46:40.884
He'll never get started.

01:46:40.988 --> 01:46:44.524
I'll make public opinion within 5 hours.
I've done it all my life.

01:46:44.625 --> 01:46:46.693
I'll blacken this punk so....

01:46:47.194 --> 01:46:48.761
Leave public opinion to me.

01:46:48.862 --> 01:46:50.395
Now, go back into the Senate...

01:46:50.497 --> 01:46:52.531
...and keep those senators lined up.

01:46:52.633 --> 01:46:55.429
I hit him from the floor
with everything I knew.

01:46:56.837 --> 01:46:58.962
I haven't got
the stomach for it anymore.

01:46:59.072 --> 01:47:03.722
If he convinces those senators,
you might as well blow your brains out.

01:47:03.822 --> 01:47:05.036
This is the works, Joe!

01:47:05.145 --> 01:47:07.736
Either we're out of business or
we're bigger than ever.

01:47:07.848 --> 01:47:11.884
We can't stop at anything until
we smash this yokel...

01:47:11.985 --> 01:47:13.027
Hendricks on the phone.

01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:14.552
Go back to the Senate,
will you?

01:47:14.655 --> 01:47:17.315
Hello, Hendricks.
Well, the chips are down.

01:47:17.424 --> 01:47:21.290
Keep everything that Smith says,
or any other pro-Smith stuff...

01:47:21.395 --> 01:47:23.725
...out of all our newspapers.
Understand?

01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:26.524
And all the others
you can line up in the state.

01:47:27.634 --> 01:47:31.670
Those broken-down opposition papers,
who won't play ball with us...

01:47:31.772 --> 01:47:34.534
...I want you to tie up for 24 hours.

01:47:35.208 --> 01:47:38.744
Stall their deliveries. Push them off
the street. I don't care!

01:47:38.845 --> 01:47:41.345
Bury them for 24 hours.
That'll give me plenty of time.

01:47:41.448 --> 01:47:44.517
And you defend the machine.
Hit this guy!

01:47:44.618 --> 01:47:47.983
The usual thing. Criminal, and
blocking a relief bill...

01:47:48.088 --> 01:47:49.678
...and starving the people.

01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:52.120
Joe, will you get back
into that Senate?

01:47:54.861 --> 01:47:56.986
And Hendricks,
get the hoi polloi excited.

01:47:57.097 --> 01:48:00.223
Have them send protest letters,
wires, anything you like.

01:48:00.333 --> 01:48:03.527
Buy every minute you can
of every radio station in the state...

01:48:03.637 --> 01:48:05.637
...and keep them
spouting against Smith.

01:48:05.739 --> 01:48:07.602
I don't care what it costs.
Pay out.

01:48:07.708 --> 01:48:09.537
Get moving.
Get the whole state moving!

01:48:15.048 --> 01:48:18.083
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt
to turn your attention...

01:48:18.185 --> 01:48:20.947
...from the true facts which
are beyond question.

01:48:21.054 --> 01:48:24.146
Jefferson Smith was caught
red-handed, stealing from boys.

01:48:24.257 --> 01:48:26.917
Relief will be stopped.
Men thrown out of jobs.

01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:40.333
- I've seen filibustering, but...
- Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.531
We've got to get
him off the floor.

01:48:42.642 --> 01:48:46.075
As long as Mr. Smith holds that
floor legitimately...

01:48:46.179 --> 01:48:48.247
...he's going to continue to hold it.

01:48:48.348 --> 01:48:50.882
If you ask me,
that fellow's making sense.

01:48:50.984 --> 01:48:53.780
Sense? You call
blackmail sense, Henry?

01:48:53.887 --> 01:48:56.581
Joe, I didn't like
this boy from the beginning.

01:48:56.690 --> 01:48:58.553
But we feel that
no man who wasn't sincere...

01:48:58.658 --> 01:49:00.817
...could fight like this
against these odds.

01:49:00.927 --> 01:49:02.858
I'm very glad
to know that, Martin.

01:49:02.963 --> 01:49:06.760
After 20 years, I'm very glad to know
you'd take his word against mine.

01:49:06.867 --> 01:49:08.662
Yes, that's what it means!

01:49:08.769 --> 01:49:10.860
If he's that much right,
then I'm wrong.

01:49:10.971 --> 01:49:13.437
Joe, can't we
work out some deal...

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:16.803
...to pull that Willet Dam out and
let the Deficiency Bill go through?

01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:18.705
It isn't a question of Willet Dam.

01:49:18.812 --> 01:49:21.142
It's a question of my honor
and reputation.

01:49:21.248 --> 01:49:25.648
The integrity of the Committee,
the integrity of the Senate itself.

01:49:25.752 --> 01:49:27.649
If you want to throw out
Section 40, go ahead.

01:49:27.754 --> 01:49:30.846
- I'll resign.
- Now, wait a minute, Joe.

01:49:30.957 --> 01:49:32.820
This is a lot of nonsense.

01:49:32.926 --> 01:49:35.494
Joe's right. A deal is impossible.

01:49:35.595 --> 01:49:37.128
We've got to go on with this.

01:49:37.230 --> 01:49:39.264
Break him, keep him talking.

01:49:39.366 --> 01:49:42.594
No relief.
Maintain a quorum in relays.

01:49:42.702 --> 01:49:45.032
- ls that how you feel, John?
- For once, I agree with you.

01:49:45.138 --> 01:49:46.899
It's time to relieve
the floor.

01:49:47.007 --> 01:49:50.008
How a man that green
knows as much as he does....

01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:51.234
Can't go on much longer.

01:49:51.344 --> 01:49:52.911
"...that they're entitled
by their creator...

01:49:53.013 --> 01:49:54.876
...with certain inalienable rights...

01:49:54.981 --> 01:49:58.050
...and that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of..."

01:50:01.054 --> 01:50:03.554
Well, looks like
the night shift's coming on.

01:50:06.459 --> 01:50:09.995
Senator will please suspend until
order is restored.

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.958
This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking.

01:50:20.069 --> 01:50:23.002
Half of official Washington is here
to see democracy's finest show...

01:50:23.105 --> 01:50:26.003
...the filibuster: The right
to talk your head off.

01:50:26.108 --> 01:50:29.302
The American privilege of free speech
in its most dramatic form.

01:50:29.411 --> 01:50:31.479
The least man in that chamber...

01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:34.114
...once he gets and holds that floor,
by the rules...

01:50:34.216 --> 01:50:37.308
...can hold it and talk as long
as he can stand on his feet.

01:50:37.419 --> 01:50:40.352
Providing always
that he does not sit down...

01:50:40.456 --> 01:50:43.719
...and that he does not leave the
chamber or stop talking.

01:50:43.826 --> 01:50:45.223
The galleries are packed.

01:50:45.327 --> 01:50:48.863
In the diplomatic gallery are the
envoys of two dictator powers.

01:50:48.964 --> 01:50:51.692
They have come here to see
what they can't see at home...

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.333
...democracy in action.

01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:56.395
"...life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness...

01:50:56.505 --> 01:50:59.870
...and to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men...

01:50:59.975 --> 01:51:02.976
...deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed...

01:51:03.078 --> 01:51:07.012
...that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends...

01:51:07.116 --> 01:51:10.845
...it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish it."

01:51:11.186 --> 01:51:12.617
How am I doing?

01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:18.382
- Quit stalling and move!
- Clark, Jim.

01:51:18.627 --> 01:51:20.251
- Oh, Clark...
- Mr. Taylor?

01:51:20.362 --> 01:51:21.690
Yes, wait a minute

01:51:22.031 --> 01:51:23.496
Phone Senator Paine about it.

01:51:23.599 --> 01:51:25.530
This is
Jim Taylor in Washington.

01:51:25.634 --> 01:51:26.928
About this Smith filibuster.

01:51:27.036 --> 01:51:29.468
Newspapers
in the Southwest must realize...

01:51:29.571 --> 01:51:31.263
...that this bill
he's trying to block...

01:51:31.373 --> 01:51:32.963
...will affect your section
as well as any.

01:51:33.075 --> 01:51:34.972
It's the patriotic duty of every
newspaper...

01:51:35.077 --> 01:51:36.508
Wait a minute. Yes?

01:51:36.612 --> 01:51:38.270
- Jackson City calling.
- Hold them!

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:40.448
We've got to keep hammering
at this man until we smash him!

01:51:41.984 --> 01:51:45.281
I get a great kick out of that part
of the Declaration of Independence.

01:51:45.721 --> 01:51:49.382
You're not going to have a country
that can make these rules work...

01:51:49.491 --> 01:51:52.082
...if you haven't got men that have
learned to tell human rights...

01:51:52.194 --> 01:51:53.488
...from a punch in the nose.

01:51:58.567 --> 01:52:00.225
That's good for a headline.

01:52:00.336 --> 01:52:02.802
It's a funny thing about men,
you know.

01:52:02.905 --> 01:52:04.905
They all start life being boys...

01:52:06.408 --> 01:52:09.136
...I wouldn't be surprised if
these senators were boys once.

01:52:09.244 --> 01:52:11.574
That's why it seemed
like a good idea...

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.441
...to get the boys out
of crowded cities...

01:52:13.549 --> 01:52:16.482
...and stuffy basements for a
couple of months out of the year...

01:52:16.585 --> 01:52:19.210
...and build their bodies
and minds for a man-sized job...

01:52:19.321 --> 01:52:22.117
...because they're going to be
behind these desks someday.

01:52:23.192 --> 01:52:26.386
It seemed like a good idea, getting
boys from all over the country...

01:52:26.495 --> 01:52:30.053
...boys of all nationalities and
ways of living.

01:52:30.165 --> 01:52:31.265
Getting them together...

01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:34.792
...let them find out what makes
different people tick.

01:52:34.903 --> 01:52:38.097
Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents
for all your rules...

01:52:38.207 --> 01:52:42.710
...if behind them they didn't have a
little ordinary everyday kindness...

01:52:42.811 --> 01:52:46.677
...and a little looking out
for the other fellow too.

01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:57.424
That's pretty important, all that.

01:52:59.061 --> 01:53:02.028
It's just the blood and bone
and sinew of this democracy...

01:53:02.131 --> 01:53:05.064
...that some great men handed down
to the human race, that's all!

01:53:05.167 --> 01:53:08.703
But if you've got to build a dam
where that boys' camp ought to be...

01:53:08.804 --> 01:53:13.363
...to pay off some political army,
that's a different thing. Oh, no!

01:53:13.475 --> 01:53:16.738
If you think I'm going back and
tell those boys in my state...

01:53:16.845 --> 01:53:18.810
..."Fellows,
forget about it.

01:53:18.914 --> 01:53:22.916
All I've been telling you about the
land you live in is a lot of hooey.

01:53:23.018 --> 01:53:27.350
This isn't your country. It belongs to
a lot of James Taylors." No, not me.

01:53:27.456 --> 01:53:30.252
Anybody here that thinks I'd do that,
they got another thing coming!

01:53:40.235 --> 01:53:43.099
I just wanted to
find out if you still had faces.

01:53:49.778 --> 01:53:52.142
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:53:53.449 --> 01:53:57.280
I know I'm being disrespectful to
this honorable body.

01:53:57.653 --> 01:54:02.087
A guy like me should never be allowed
to get in here in the first place.

01:54:02.191 --> 01:54:06.625
And I hate to stand here and
try your patience like this, but l...

01:54:06.728 --> 01:54:09.388
Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!

01:54:09.498 --> 01:54:12.692
You wouldn't care to put that
to a vote, would you, senator?

01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:17.930
Will the senator yield for a question?
- I yield.

01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:20.870
In view of the gentlemen's touching
concern for the senators...

01:54:20.976 --> 01:54:23.840
...and the fact that he's been
talking for 7 1/2 hours...

01:54:23.946 --> 01:54:26.310
...and must be very, very tired...

01:54:26.415 --> 01:54:29.109
...would he permit a motion to recess
until the morning...

01:54:29.218 --> 01:54:33.482
...at which time he may better continue
with his profound babblings.

01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:35.088
No. No, don't!

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.760
Ask him!

01:54:47.536 --> 01:54:50.127
Mr. President, what happens
in the morning...

01:54:50.239 --> 01:54:51.772
...I mean, about my...

01:54:51.874 --> 01:54:55.137
...having this floor to
go on with my "babblings"?

01:54:55.244 --> 01:54:58.313
If the senator permits
this motion for a recess...

01:54:58.413 --> 01:54:59.946
...he won't have the floor
in the morning...

01:55:00.048 --> 01:55:01.809
...to babble with or anything else...

01:55:02.251 --> 01:55:05.809
...unless he is recognized first
by this chair.

01:55:13.529 --> 01:55:15.688
As I was saying, gentlemen...

01:55:16.431 --> 01:55:18.499
...I'm either dead right
or I'm crazy...

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.634
...and I feel fine.

01:55:20.736 --> 01:55:23.566
What have you got, Dick?
- From Miss Saunders.

01:55:49.765 --> 01:55:51.355
Is the senator yielding the floor?

01:55:54.102 --> 01:55:56.500
Yield? Oh, no!

01:55:57.806 --> 01:55:59.168
I feel fine!

01:56:01.977 --> 01:56:05.012
The Constitution of the United States.

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:14.116
Page one, top left-hand corner.

01:56:14.590 --> 01:56:16.214
"We the people of the United States...

01:56:16.325 --> 01:56:18.017
...in order to form
a more perfect union...."

01:56:18.126 --> 01:56:20.126
Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it!

01:56:20.762 --> 01:56:23.160
Brady's column too?
Holy smokes!

01:56:23.265 --> 01:56:24.349
What's the matter?

01:56:24.449 --> 01:56:26.831
This is murder,
you got to call him off.

01:56:26.935 --> 01:56:28.969
- He's getting nowhere.
What are you talking about?

01:56:29.137 --> 01:56:31.330
Not one word of what he says
is being printed in that state.

01:56:31.506 --> 01:56:32.573
Oh, no!

01:56:32.673 --> 01:56:35.369
Taylor has practically every paper
in the state lined up...

01:56:35.477 --> 01:56:37.238
...and he's feeding them
doctored-up junk!

01:56:37.346 --> 01:56:40.506
- One man muzzling a whole state?
- And how!

01:56:40.649 --> 01:56:42.842
Freedom of the press!

01:56:44.653 --> 01:56:46.948
Wait a minute! I've got an idea!

01:56:48.156 --> 01:56:51.248
Jeff has a paper there,
Boy Stuff, right?

01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:52.693
Terrific!

01:56:52.793 --> 01:56:56.127
They aren't letting what Jeff says
get printed in the state.

01:56:56.231 --> 01:56:58.458
If I give you a raft
over the phone now...

01:56:58.567 --> 01:57:00.430
Write me a front-page raft, Diz.

01:57:00.535 --> 01:57:02.102
Can you print it out...

01:57:02.204 --> 01:57:04.602
...and spread a billion copies of it?

01:57:04.706 --> 01:57:06.205
Swell!

01:57:06.308 --> 01:57:08.239
Get ready to take it down,
will you, Mrs. Smith?

01:57:08.410 --> 01:57:09.494
All right.

01:57:09.594 --> 01:57:12.704
Boys, everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!

01:57:14.216 --> 01:57:15.544
All right, here we go!

01:57:15.817 --> 01:57:16.975
All ready, Clarissa.

01:57:17.352 --> 01:57:19.716
She called me Clarissa!

01:57:20.322 --> 01:57:22.287
Okay, Ma!

01:57:23.191 --> 01:57:25.452
"Jeff Tells Truth.

01:57:25.727 --> 01:57:26.987
Shows Up Taylor."

01:57:27.329 --> 01:57:29.829
I want the whole morning edition.
Push him off the floor!

01:57:29.965 --> 01:57:32.033
Start your campaign
for protests. Wired!

01:57:32.601 --> 01:57:35.636
"Willet Dam is a fraud to
line the pockets of the Taylor machine."

01:57:35.737 --> 01:57:37.930
Here's your front-page editorial.
Wait!

01:57:38.707 --> 01:57:39.899
"A convicted thief representing you...

01:57:40.008 --> 01:57:42.133
...holds the floor of
the United States Senate."

01:57:42.344 --> 01:57:43.809
All right, boys. Hurry up!

01:57:43.912 --> 01:57:46.242
She said rush!
Get cracking now!

01:57:55.357 --> 01:57:57.516
Come on!
Bring on the paper!

01:58:35.797 --> 01:58:39.298
"...charity wanteth not itself...

01:58:39.768 --> 01:58:41.301
...is not propped up...

01:58:44.039 --> 01:58:47.131
...and now abideth faith...

01:58:47.909 --> 01:58:50.443
...hope, charity...

01:58:50.779 --> 01:58:52.346
...these three.

01:58:54.282 --> 01:58:57.146
The greatest of these is charity."

01:59:39.427 --> 01:59:40.511
Read about Jeff.

01:59:40.611 --> 01:59:43.220
Boy's Stuff circulars.
Peddled by 9 million kids.

01:59:43.331 --> 01:59:46.730
What are you standing there for?
Get the boys out! Kill it!

02:00:00.682 --> 02:00:02.943
Get these papers out of here.

02:00:08.423 --> 02:00:11.424
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!

02:00:24.239 --> 02:00:26.933
Wire Congress!

02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:35.975
Are we going to let a man like Jeff
throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?

02:00:37.819 --> 02:00:39.181
Are you for Joe Paine?

02:00:42.591 --> 02:00:44.625
Hurray for Jeff Smith!

02:01:00.277 --> 02:01:02.196
Children hurt all over the city.

02:01:02.392 --> 02:01:04.128
Tell Jeff to stop!

02:01:04.438 --> 02:01:06.904
Yes, all right.

02:01:07.007 --> 02:01:08.335
Goodbye.

02:01:10.143 --> 02:01:13.663
"Senator Smith has now talked
for 23 hours and 16 minutes.

02:01:13.763 --> 02:01:16.577
It's the most unusual and spectacular
thing in the Senate annuls.

02:01:16.683 --> 02:01:18.273
One lone and simple American...

02:01:18.385 --> 02:01:20.180
...holding the greatest
floor in the land.

02:01:20.287 --> 02:01:23.083
What he lacked in experience,
he's made up in fight.

02:01:23.323 --> 02:01:25.948
But those tired Boy Ranger legs
are buckling.

02:01:26.059 --> 02:01:27.820
Bleary-eyed, voice gone.

02:01:27.928 --> 02:01:30.826
He can't go on much longer.
And all official Washington...

02:01:30.931 --> 02:01:32.862
...is here to be in on the kill."

02:01:33.734 --> 02:01:36.302
There's no compromise with truth.

02:01:36.403 --> 02:01:39.438
That's all I got up
on this floor to say.

02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:41.337
When was it?

02:01:42.175 --> 02:01:43.537
A year ago, it seems like.

02:01:43.643 --> 02:01:46.735
Terrible things are happening.
I've got to stop him.

02:01:46.847 --> 02:01:48.426
They're listening to him.
Anything might happen now.

02:01:48.526 --> 02:01:52.142
Just get up off the ground.
That's all I ask.

02:01:52.252 --> 02:01:55.651
Get up there with that lady
that's on top of this Capitol dome.

02:01:55.756 --> 02:01:57.949
That lady that stands for liberty.

02:01:58.692 --> 02:02:01.886
Look at this country through her eyes
if you want to see something.

02:02:03.163 --> 02:02:05.197
But you won't just see scenery.

02:02:05.298 --> 02:02:08.299
You'll see the whole parade of what
man's carved out for himself...

02:02:08.402 --> 02:02:10.527
...after centuries of fighting.

02:02:10.904 --> 02:02:13.632
Fighting for something better
than just jungle law.

02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:17.840
Fighting so he can stand on
his own two feet, free and decent...

02:02:17.944 --> 02:02:19.409
...like he was created.

02:02:19.513 --> 02:02:22.343
No matter what his race,
color or creed.

02:02:24.584 --> 02:02:26.276
That's what you'd see.

02:02:27.487 --> 02:02:29.748
There's no place
out there for graft...

02:02:29.856 --> 02:02:31.787
...or greed or lies...

02:02:31.892 --> 02:02:34.722
...or compromise with human liberties.

02:02:34.828 --> 02:02:38.455
If that's what the grownups
have done with this world...

02:02:38.565 --> 02:02:40.496
...we better get those
boys' camps started fast...

02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.725
...and see what the kids can do.

02:02:43.503 --> 02:02:45.400
It's not too late.

02:02:45.806 --> 02:02:48.739
Because this country is
bigger than the Taylors...

02:02:48.842 --> 02:02:51.035
...or you or me or anything else!

02:02:52.746 --> 02:02:55.747
Great principles don't get lost once
they come to light.

02:02:55.849 --> 02:02:57.883
They're right here!

02:02:58.018 --> 02:03:00.552
You just have to see them again.

02:03:03.824 --> 02:03:05.482
Mr. President.

02:03:05.826 --> 02:03:07.257
Will the senator yield
for a question?

02:03:07.894 --> 02:03:09.757
Will Senator Smith yield
to his colleague?

02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:12.221
Yes, I yield for a question.

02:03:12.332 --> 02:03:15.959
The senator has said he is speaking
to the people of his state.

02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:19.161
He has been waiting,
as he so fancifully puts it...

02:03:19.272 --> 02:03:21.806
...for them to come
marching here in droves.

02:03:21.975 --> 02:03:25.135
Would the gentlemen be interested
in what those people have to say?

02:03:25.245 --> 02:03:26.972
Here it comes.

02:03:27.114 --> 02:03:28.909
Yes, sir, you bet I would.

02:03:30.317 --> 02:03:31.401
Mr. President.

02:03:31.501 --> 02:03:33.246
Have I permission to bring in...

02:03:33.353 --> 02:03:35.444
...evidence of
the response of my state?

02:03:35.555 --> 02:03:37.486
Is there objection?

02:03:38.592 --> 02:03:39.784
You may proceed, senator.

02:03:39.893 --> 02:03:41.358
Pageboys!

02:04:16.763 --> 02:04:20.458
I can't stand it. I can't stand
to see him hurt like this.

02:04:20.567 --> 02:04:22.100
Public opinion made to order.

02:04:22.202 --> 02:04:23.826
Taylor-made.

02:04:24.171 --> 02:04:27.832
There it is.
There's the gentleman's answer.

02:04:27.941 --> 02:04:30.532
Telegrams. 50,000 of them...

02:04:30.644 --> 02:04:32.302
...demanding that he yield this floor.

02:04:32.412 --> 02:04:34.036
I invite the Senate to read them.

02:04:34.181 --> 02:04:36.010
I invite my colleague to read them.

02:04:36.116 --> 02:04:38.878
The people's answer to
Mr. Jefferson Smith.

02:05:22.696 --> 02:05:24.696
Stop, Jeff! Stop!

02:06:09.643 --> 02:06:13.235
I guess this is just another
lost cause, Mr. Paine.

02:06:18.351 --> 02:06:21.750
All you people don't know
about lost causes.

02:06:22.255 --> 02:06:23.913
Mr. Paine does.

02:06:25.959 --> 02:06:29.586
He said once they were
the only causes worth fighting for.

02:06:29.996 --> 02:06:32.155
He fought for them once.

02:06:32.565 --> 02:06:36.260
For the only reason that any man
ever fights for them.

02:06:39.406 --> 02:06:42.907
Because of just one plain, simple rule:

02:06:43.643 --> 02:06:44.937
Love thy neighbor.

02:06:46.613 --> 02:06:47.907
In this world today...

02:06:48.014 --> 02:06:49.172
...full of hatred...

02:06:49.282 --> 02:06:52.283
...a man who knows that one rule
has a great trust.

02:06:52.385 --> 02:06:55.113
You know that rule, Mr. Paine.

02:06:55.588 --> 02:06:58.816
And I loved you for it,
just as my father did.

02:06:58.958 --> 02:07:02.494
And you know you fight for lost causes
harder than for any others.

02:07:02.929 --> 02:07:05.259
Yes, you even die for them.

02:07:06.933 --> 02:07:09.627
Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine.

02:07:12.806 --> 02:07:14.703
You think I'm licked.

02:07:16.843 --> 02:07:18.308
You all think I'm licked!

02:07:20.146 --> 02:07:22.180
Well, I'm not licked!

02:07:22.282 --> 02:07:25.442
I'm going to stay right here
and fight for this lost cause!

02:07:25.552 --> 02:07:29.247
Even if this room gets
filled with lies like these...

02:07:29.989 --> 02:07:34.549
...and the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

02:07:35.595 --> 02:07:37.890
Somebody will listen to me.

02:08:01.321 --> 02:08:03.389
He's okay. He just fainted.

02:08:15.668 --> 02:08:17.395
- Let me go!
What's the matter, Joe?

02:08:17.504 --> 02:08:19.868
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!

02:08:19.973 --> 02:08:21.506
Expel me!

02:08:21.608 --> 02:08:22.834
Expel me, not him!

02:08:22.942 --> 02:08:24.168
Willy Taylor's a fraud!

02:08:24.277 --> 02:08:26.402
It's a crime against
the people who sent me here...

02:08:26.513 --> 02:08:29.207
...and I committed it! Every word
that boy said is the truth!

02:08:29.315 --> 02:08:31.474
Every word about Taylor
and me and graft...

02:08:31.584 --> 02:08:33.948
...and the rotten political
corruption in my state!

02:08:34.053 --> 02:08:36.678
Every word of it is true!
I'm not fit for office!

02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:38.824
I'm not fit for
any place of honor or trust!

02:08:38.925 --> 02:08:40.788
Expel me, not that boy!

02:08:50.003 --> 02:08:51.934
We did it! We did it!

02:08:56.443 --> 02:08:58.636
Order gentlemen! Please!

02:09:08.321 --> 02:09:09.421
He did it!

02:09:09.522 --> 02:09:11.317
Let go of me!

02:09:14.994 --> 02:09:16.721
Yippee!
