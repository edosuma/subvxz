00:10.711 --> 00:13.445
(pensive music)

00:28.629 --> 00:30.529
- [Sue] I've always
loved comics.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.264
My dad has a huge collection.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.633
Even rarities like "Super Moon",

00:34.635 --> 00:36.301
the girl with the moon scream.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.270
Her real name is
Theodora Summers

00:38.272 --> 00:40.572
but everyone just calls her T.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.075
She got bullied for
her very bright eyes

00:43.077 --> 00:44.676
and her strange hair,

00:44.678 --> 00:47.112
but when she discovered
her real powers

00:47.114 --> 00:51.216
and became Super Moon,
everything changed.

00:51.218 --> 00:55.054
Since then she knows who she
is and what she has to do.

00:55.056 --> 00:59.258
Unfortunately, real life
is much more complicated.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.161
I wish I had some special skill

01:02.163 --> 01:06.065
so at least somebody
would be interested in me,

01:06.067 --> 01:08.834
but I'm not like
Super Moon or like T.

01:08.836 --> 01:14.106
(phone ringing)
(mellow dramatic music)

01:18.145 --> 01:19.411
- [Christopher]
Sue, where are you?

01:19.413 --> 01:22.548
- Um (sighs), I'll
be there in a sec.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.083
- [Christopher] We
don't have much time.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.818
You got the package?

01:26.620 --> 01:27.553
- Yeah.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.554
- [Christopher] Hurry up.

01:28.556 --> 01:32.391
(upbeat music)
(fist banging)

01:32.393 --> 01:33.459
- [Sue] Hello?

01:33.461 --> 01:34.293
(Sue sighs)

01:34.295 --> 01:35.294
Miss Gunnarsson?

01:35.296 --> 01:39.331
(fist banging)
(upbeat music)

01:39.333 --> 01:40.866
- Susanna, oh my God.

01:40.868 --> 01:41.834
I didn't see you there.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.335
I thought everyone had left.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.770
- [Sue] No problem, I gotta go.

01:44.772 --> 01:45.637
Bye.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.209
My dad says this is
your special skill.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.278
No one notices you,
like a secret agent.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.416
But is it really cool if no
one even knows you exist?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.450
- [Eileen] No, he won't say no.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.284
(Sue sighs)

01:59.286 --> 02:00.352
It's gonna be

02:00.354 --> 02:01.653
an epic Halloween party.
- Excuse me?

02:01.655 --> 02:02.588
Excuse me?

02:02.590 --> 02:05.324
Eileen, please can I just...

02:05.326 --> 02:08.293
¶ But how how how's it goin' ¶

02:08.294 --> 02:10.128
- [Eileen] Hi Gwyn.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.363
Yes, DJ Goblin is playing.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.831
Amazing, huh?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.166
Yeah, I know.

02:14.168 --> 02:14.900
- Ugh.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.869
Worst of all is my mother.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.505
She's one of the world's
leading scientists.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.873
She's incredibly successful,

02:20.875 --> 02:24.910
especially at ignoring
her own daughter.

02:24.912 --> 02:29.548
Nobody really knows what
she's doing in her laboratory.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.385
(machine hissing)
(pensive music)

02:33.387 --> 02:38.457
(machine beeping)
(pensive music)

02:39.560 --> 02:44.463
(machine whirring)
(pensive music)

02:47.601 --> 02:52.571
(machine hissing)
(pensive music)

02:52.573 --> 02:54.206
- Okay, here we go.

02:56.510 --> 03:01.280
This is going to change
the world (sighs).

03:01.282 --> 03:04.249
- [Sue] I know my mother's
inventing crazy things all day

03:04.251 --> 03:06.652
and working with the
greatest scientists.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.554
She thinks I'm boring,

03:09.757 --> 03:12.291
but she shouldn't
underestimate me,

03:12.293 --> 03:15.894
because today I'll show
her what I'm able to do.

03:15.896 --> 03:19.298
(mellow dramatic music)

03:20.501 --> 03:24.503
(audience applauding)

03:24.505 --> 03:28.807
(woman speaking in
foreign language)

03:28.809 --> 03:31.577
- Good evening and welcome.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.412
May I introduce the man who

03:33.414 --> 03:35.948
this very day has
announced a revolution

03:35.950 --> 03:39.785
in the field of genetics,
Doctor Jonas Drill.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.819
- Ah, yes.

03:40.821 --> 03:41.987
Thank you very much.

03:41.989 --> 03:45.290
(audience applauding)

03:45.292 --> 03:49.928
Imagine if you will, living
in a world without illness,

03:50.798 --> 03:53.265
a world without weaknesses,

03:53.267 --> 03:55.534
with your body
reacting by using,

03:55.536 --> 03:58.403
let's call it a
protective screen.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.441
- Engine started,
target localized.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.275
Ready?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.276
- Yeah.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.344
Do you want me to drive old man?

04:05.346 --> 04:06.778
Let's get out of here, come on.

04:06.780 --> 04:11.016
(engine sputtering)
(gentle music)

04:11.018 --> 04:16.288
(engine revving)
(gentle music)

04:16.290 --> 04:18.457
- Please, welcome with me one

04:18.458 --> 04:20.625
of the most successful
geneticists and
mutation scientists

04:20.628 --> 04:24.363
and my good friend,
Dr. Maria Hartmann.

04:24.365 --> 04:28.867
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

04:28.869 --> 04:33.939
(mellow dramatic music)
(engine rumbling)

04:34.975 --> 04:37.542
Maria uh, in a nutshell,
your creation uh,

04:38.679 --> 04:42.047
could be called uh,
the human 2.0, yes?

04:42.049 --> 04:43.382
- [Sue] She's not even here.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.650
- Sue, don't worry.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.684
Let's stick to the plan.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.752
She'll be here.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.388
(gentle music)

04:50.324 --> 04:51.823
(Maria's throat clears)

04:51.825 --> 04:53.558
- Good evening.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.295
Let's begin with some dry facts.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.965
(pensive music)

05:04.371 --> 05:07.739
- Uh, honey I don't
think that's a good idea.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.640
Ah, damn!

05:09.476 --> 05:10.375
Oh.

05:11.679 --> 05:12.844
It's all right.
- Dad!

05:12.846 --> 05:14.413
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

05:14.415 --> 05:18.083
- NT26D is the working
title for this program.

05:18.085 --> 05:23.355
(alarm beeping)
(attendees chattering)

05:29.530 --> 05:30.762
Christopher?

05:30.764 --> 05:31.596
- Oh.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.764
Okay, go.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.099
Ready?

05:34.101 --> 05:37.936
¶ Happy birthday to you ¶

05:37.938 --> 05:40.772
- Christopher, you
can't be serious.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.040
- I'll tell Dr. Drill.

05:42.042 --> 05:47.112
(alarm blaring)
(flame crackling)

05:49.083 --> 05:50.449
- Oh no.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.718
Do you realize what you've done?

05:52.720 --> 05:54.853
What the hell were you thinking?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.422
(Maria sighs)

05:58.859 --> 06:00.859
- Well, it was meant
to be a surprise.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.629
- [Maria] Do you have any idea
what you've wiped off here?

06:04.631 --> 06:07.599
- Yeah, I do but do you
realize it's your birthday?

06:07.601 --> 06:09.134
- I wasn't talking
to you Susanna.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.370
Christopher, we are
making history here.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.072
- We thought you'd like the
surprise, but of course not.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.407
It's always about your work.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.575
- You have to go now.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.409
Please.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.643
Lenia's waiting.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.578
I have to go back.
- Come on Maria.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.746
She wanted to surprise you.

06:20.748 --> 06:21.680
- Today, of all days
- It was my--

06:21.682 --> 06:22.147
- [Maria] you pulled this.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.148
Christopher!

06:23.150 --> 06:23.949
- It was my idea.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.816
I lit the candles, okay?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.652
Sorry kiddo.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.487
- [Maria] Hundreds of the
best scientists are there.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.757
This could win me the Nobel
Prize and you bring me cake.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.159
- Why don't you go to hell then?

06:34.161 --> 06:35.127
(Sue groans)

06:35.129 --> 06:38.463
(metal clangs)
(cat meows)

06:38.465 --> 06:40.132
(machine whirring)

06:40.133 --> 06:41.800
- [Female Robotic Voice]
Activation process initiated.

06:41.802 --> 06:46.705
(machine whirring)
(pensive music)

06:46.707 --> 06:49.508
Emergency shut down activated.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.142
- Damn it.

06:50.144 --> 06:53.478
(tense music)

06:53.480 --> 06:54.646
Damn it.

06:54.647 --> 06:55.813
- [Female Robotic Voice]
Bio reactor temperature

06:55.816 --> 06:57.549
at critical level.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.583
- Stop, come on.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.851
Stop.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.787
- [Male Robotic Voice] I
don't like to intervene

07:01.789 --> 07:05.424
but you shouldn't
press anymore buttons.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.458
- What?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.627
Uh, who's speaking?

07:08.628 --> 07:10.795
- [Female Robotic Voice]
Warning, reactor overheating.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.464
- [Sue] No!

07:12.466 --> 07:14.233
- [Male Robotic Voice] This
is not very productive.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.001
The reactor can only
be shut down manually.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.202
- Frickin' great.

07:17.204 --> 07:22.474
(alarm blaring)
(tense music)

07:35.489 --> 07:36.621
- [Male Robotic Voice]
If I may say so,

07:36.623 --> 07:37.789
this is not the answer.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.024
- Please, shut up!

07:39.026 --> 07:41.126
Are you some kind of
computer or something?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.595
(alarm blaring)
(tense music)

07:43.597 --> 07:44.930
Hello?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.198
Talk to me.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.465
- [Male Robotic Voice] You
ordered me to be quiet.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.534
- Man, can you help?

07:49.536 --> 07:50.552
Do something.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.569
- [Male Robotic Voice]
The core temperature

07:51.572 --> 07:52.037
is already too high.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.472
It's critical.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.906
I advise you to leave
the reactor immediately.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.043
(reactor hissing)
(Sue exclaiming)

07:58.045 --> 08:00.745
I strongly urge you
to exit the building.

08:00.747 --> 08:01.847
Get out of here now.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.649
(dramatic music)

08:11.225 --> 08:12.524
- Hello!

08:14.862 --> 08:16.495
(reactor whirring)

08:16.497 --> 08:19.197
(reactor booming)

08:23.604 --> 08:28.673
(gentle music)
(molecules whooshing)

08:34.581 --> 08:37.131
(siren wailing)

08:37.133 --> 08:39.683
(EMT's speaking in
foreign language)

08:40.654 --> 08:41.919
- Gauze please?

08:41.922 --> 08:45.957
(EMT's speaking in
foreign language)

08:47.294 --> 08:48.994
Your daughter was very lucky.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.863
She had more than one
guardian angle today.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.764
All done.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.835
- I'm glad nothing
happened to you,

08:56.837 --> 08:59.704
and you can't remember a thing?

09:00.307 --> 09:01.873
- Uh uh.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.609
Um, I was just sitting there,

09:04.611 --> 09:08.547
and suddenly there was
this like loud bang.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.283
- And you didn't notice
anything unusual before?

09:11.285 --> 09:13.285
- Um, we better go home now.

09:13.287 --> 09:17.689
(helicopter engine whirring)
(workers chattering)

09:17.691 --> 09:20.659
Uh, we'll talk about
the rest tomorrow.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.793
- Yes, I agree.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.964
Hope you feel
better and I thought

09:25.966 --> 09:29.868
your little birthday
surprise was really cool.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.604
- Thank you.

09:32.606 --> 09:36.975
(siren wailing)
(helicopter engine whirring)

09:44.318 --> 09:49.588
(tense music)
(siren waling)

09:52.259 --> 09:53.091
Let's go.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.660
(tense music)

10:03.170 --> 10:05.136
- [Sue] We thought
you'd like the surprise.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.339
- [Maria] You know she isn't
even supposed to be here.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.040
This is no place for a child.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.709
We've talked about this before.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.677
- [Christopher] Come on Maria,
she wanted to surprise you.

10:12.679 --> 10:15.313
(somber music)

10:38.138 --> 10:42.207
- She didn't even ask
me how I was doing.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.041
(sighs)

10:43.043 --> 10:44.743
- Yeah, she did.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.411
- No she didn't.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.278
Liar.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.016
- She was there first
after the explosion.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.151
- To rescue her
brilliant project.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.252
She doesn't care.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.387
I'm invisible to her.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.123
(eerie music)

11:10.003 --> 11:10.835
Super Moon?

11:10.837 --> 11:13.405
(eerie music)

11:25.052 --> 11:30.121
(mallet clinking)
(eerie music)

11:36.463 --> 11:41.733
(Sue groaning)
(mallet clinking)

11:47.908 --> 11:50.709
(Sue vomiting)

11:52.446 --> 11:53.278
- Morning.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.814
(Sue panting)

11:58.418 --> 11:59.718
Uh, you okay?

12:00.487 --> 12:01.853
- Mm, yeah.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.222
Um, I'm good.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.790
We're practicing.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.925
- [Christopher] Practicing?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.460
- The moon scream.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.794
(Christopher chuckles)

12:09.796 --> 12:10.495
- Uh huh.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.996
Oh, also we only have--

12:11.998 --> 12:12.931
(Sue sighs)

12:12.933 --> 12:14.232
- I know, only 10 minutes.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.133
- Exactly.

12:16.470 --> 12:19.104
(door latches)

12:22.809 --> 12:25.510
(engine rumbling)

12:25.512 --> 12:26.678
(Sue sighs)

12:26.679 --> 12:27.845
- [Sue] You can't
abandon me now.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.747
Not after yesterday.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.781
- [Christopher] Abandon you?

12:29.783 --> 12:30.482
It's just a short tour.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.083
Just a few days.

12:33.487 --> 12:34.819
(door slams)

12:34.821 --> 12:35.854
(Sue sighs)

12:35.856 --> 12:36.788
- You're a traitor.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.756
- Cry baby.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.859
(kids chattering)

12:42.496 --> 12:44.829
(Christopher chuckles)

12:44.831 --> 12:45.997
I really love you.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.265
- [Sue] I love you too.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.800
- Is that a new backpack?

12:48.802 --> 12:49.768
- [Sue] Why?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.536
- It's a weird color for you.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.037
- Have fun in Prague.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.439
- [Christopher]
Have fun in school.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.540
- I always do.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.808
- [Christopher] Liar.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.842
- Mm hm.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.444
(school bell ringing)

12:59.446 --> 13:01.546
(Sue sighs)

13:01.548 --> 13:02.781
(locker latches)

13:02.783 --> 13:05.483
(kids chattering)

13:08.388 --> 13:09.287
Oh, yuck.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.058
- [Eileen] I've seen some
fake blood but I don't know

13:14.060 --> 13:16.895
which hair color yet so I'll
let you know what I decide.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.798
(kids chattering)

13:22.102 --> 13:23.835
- A Halloween party?

13:23.837 --> 13:24.469
Awesome.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.537
- Oh uh, hi.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.376
- You're Super Moon?

13:31.378 --> 13:32.844
- Uh, yeah.

13:32.846 --> 13:33.878
I'm T.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.315
Uh, uh, I mean (laughs)--

13:37.317 --> 13:38.249
- T?

13:38.251 --> 13:39.484
Tobi, Tobias Grimm (chuckles).

13:39.486 --> 13:40.418
- Hi, I'm--

13:40.420 --> 13:41.820
- Excuse me, hold this for me.

13:41.822 --> 13:42.921
Hi.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.423
You must be the new guy, right?

13:45.425 --> 13:46.891
I'm Eileen.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.126
Have you heard about
the Halloween party?

13:48.128 --> 13:49.394
DJ Goblin will be there.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.596
- Damn.
- Selfie, cheese.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.364
- Super cool Eileen.
- What?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.866
What's happening?

13:56.203 --> 13:57.836
- Where'd she go with
my hot chocolate?

13:57.838 --> 13:59.170
(Sue gasps)

13:59.172 --> 14:02.106
- [Sue] What is happening to me?

14:02.108 --> 14:03.842
Why am I invisible?

14:03.844 --> 14:05.276
- [Tobi] Hey Super Moon,

14:05.278 --> 14:07.512
where did you go?
- Am I dying?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.147
Oh, I must be dreaming.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.884
(mysterious music)

14:12.886 --> 14:14.352
Oh, it feels weird.

14:16.590 --> 14:17.488
Oh my God.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.191
Completely invisible.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.027
Damn, stop it!

14:23.864 --> 14:25.230
Go away.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.564
Dang it!

14:26.566 --> 14:28.767
No, no, no.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.969
(water splashing)
(towel dispenser whirring)

14:30.971 --> 14:31.870
- Oh my God!

14:31.872 --> 14:33.338
(water splashing)

14:33.340 --> 14:34.572
- [Sue] What's happening?

14:34.574 --> 14:38.643
(eerie music)
(water splashing)

14:38.645 --> 14:41.145
- [Jean] You have to believe
me, I'm telling you the truth.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.413
The bathroom is haunted.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.648
There was something there.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.516
Everything was moving.
- Now Jean, calm down.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.286
Let's just take a
look together, okay?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.221
Oh, Susanna, good morning.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.490
- I swear, there was nobody.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.894
I mean, somebody but
something invisible.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.129
(water splashing)
(Jean panting)

14:58.131 --> 15:02.166
- Susanna, did you
see anything unusual?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.101
- Mm mm.

15:03.103 --> 15:03.635
- [Jean] But, someone was here.

15:03.637 --> 15:04.936
I saw them.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.337
Not like seeing but...

15:06.339 --> 15:09.140
- You just come with
me for now, all right?

15:09.142 --> 15:10.942
And I'll see you
in a little bit.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.945
(dryer whirring)

15:17.350 --> 15:18.349
- Uh, yeah.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.319
Hopefully, you'll see me.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.956
(eerie music)

15:28.295 --> 15:33.364
(gentle music)
(PA announcer chattering)

15:34.935 --> 15:36.567
- [Dr. Drill] We have a new
video conference in two days.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.570
- But Dr. Drill, everything
is completely destroyed.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.406
It'll take weeks to rebuild.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.708
- The day after
tomorrow, five p.m.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.278
(PA announcer chattering)
(gentle music)

15:47.280 --> 15:49.013
- [Sue] Mom!

15:49.015 --> 15:49.647
Mom!

15:49.649 --> 15:50.615
(objects clattering)

15:50.617 --> 15:51.950
- Susanna?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.051
(Sue groans)
(objects clattering)

15:53.053 --> 15:53.952
Susanna!

15:55.989 --> 15:57.088
Susanna?

15:58.391 --> 16:01.159
- I, I can make
myself invisible.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.963
(dramatic music)

16:11.037 --> 16:15.506
(computer beeping)
(water bubbling)

16:15.508 --> 16:18.743
(door bangs)

16:18.745 --> 16:19.577
- [Maria] Good morning.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.045
How are you?

16:21.047 --> 16:22.046
Are you hungry?

16:22.048 --> 16:24.282
You want something to eat?

16:26.086 --> 16:29.320
- I feel like I've run
a 10,000 mile marathon.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.221
- Here.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.457
This will give you energy.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.293
Carbohydrates and enzymes.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.227
(Maria sighs)

16:36.229 --> 16:37.662
What an unbelievable effect.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.497
We need to do a lot of tests.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.265
I ordered an infra red camera

16:41.267 --> 16:44.002
so I can film you even
when you're invisible.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.071
Then, we'll have real proof.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.473
I took a sample of your blood

16:48.475 --> 16:52.577
and I'm getting it
tested but you (gasps)...

16:52.579 --> 16:53.478
Susanna?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.446
- [Sue] What?

16:57.617 --> 16:59.584
- Are you invisible again?

16:59.586 --> 17:02.020
Are you able to
control the effect?

17:02.022 --> 17:04.122
Does it react to
external influences?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.723
Does it come suddenly or...

17:06.726 --> 17:09.527
(eerie music)

17:09.529 --> 17:11.362
(Maria gasps)

17:11.364 --> 17:13.364
How did you do that?

17:13.366 --> 17:16.067
- Warm and cold, I guess.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.101
- Amazing.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.403
At what temperature?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.038
Let's try it again.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.807
- I'm not your
science experiment.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.675
What if it stays
like this forever?

17:24.676 --> 17:26.444
I can't even wash
my hands without

17:26.445 --> 17:29.080
my body disappearing,
do you understand?

17:29.082 --> 17:34.152
I'm a monster, a freak ever
since I touched that blue stuff.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.087
(Sue sighs)

17:36.089 --> 17:38.222
Can you please just
make it stop somehow?

17:38.224 --> 17:39.457
(Maria sighs)

17:39.459 --> 17:40.825
- For now, you'll
stay at home, okay?

17:40.827 --> 17:43.094
No school today, not
a word to anyone.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.163
No texts, no email,
do you understand?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.532
(tense music)

17:52.072 --> 17:53.337
(line trilling)

17:53.339 --> 17:54.272
(phone beeps)

17:54.274 --> 17:55.440
- [Christopher] You've reached

17:55.442 --> 17:56.240
the voicemail of
Christopher Hartmann.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.475
I'll call back as soon

17:57.477 --> 17:59.277
as possible unless
the world is ending.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.445
- Damn it.

18:00.447 --> 18:05.116
(students whooping)
(upbeat music)

18:16.830 --> 18:18.162
(students applauding)

18:18.164 --> 18:19.430
- Tobi, that was awesome.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.099
So, about the Halloween party,

18:21.101 --> 18:23.101
I was thinking you maybe--
- Could you hold this?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.603
(upbeat music)
(kids chattering)

18:25.605 --> 18:27.105
Hi.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.106
- [Sue] Hi.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.241
- You disappeared yesterday.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.211
- Yeah, happens a lot lately.

18:33.213 --> 18:33.845
- Okay.

18:33.847 --> 18:34.879
Uh, that's yours right?

18:34.881 --> 18:36.881
I have the second issue at home.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.249
- The second one, yeah?

18:38.251 --> 18:39.517
- Yeah.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.119
- [Eileen] So you know
the school freak now?

18:41.121 --> 18:43.754
Anyway, party's at
the old town pool.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.389
- [Tobi] Sue?

18:45.391 --> 18:46.624
- Forget her.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.625
She's a bit nuts,
kind of a loser.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.761
Get me?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.896
No friends, reading super
hero crap all day (laughs).

18:51.898 --> 18:52.897
You already got a costume?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.398
I can help you.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.234
- [Sue] Leave him alone
you piece of trash.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.702
- Hey!

18:57.704 --> 18:59.670
It's you, I forgot you
were still lurking around.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.139
(singer yodeling)
(upbeat music)

19:01.141 --> 19:02.874
What is that?
- Oh my.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.275
- Wait, that's not mind.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.476
That's not my ringtone.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.744
I can't turn it off.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.713
It's coming from,
it's coming from,

19:08.715 --> 19:10.148
I don't know why
it's doing that.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.149
(kids laughing)

19:11.151 --> 19:12.316
Okay, we have to
get out of here.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.685
(footsteps receding)
(upbeat music)

19:14.687 --> 19:17.321
(device beeps)

19:20.627 --> 19:22.694
- [Sue] Thanks.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.762
You're from the robotics
club in the basement, right?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.197
- It doesn't mean
we're friends now.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.198
You get me?

19:32.272 --> 19:35.439
My name's Kaya but
everyone calls me App.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.507
- Okay, App.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.547
Oh uh, hi.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.447
- Hi.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.351
Uh, um, I wanted
to ask um, would,

19:48.488 --> 19:51.589
would you like to
um, I was wondering--

19:51.591 --> 19:52.924
- Would I like to?

19:52.926 --> 19:54.825
- Maybe we could, I don't know,

19:54.827 --> 19:55.960
maybe we could, I don't know,

19:55.962 --> 19:59.230
do something, go
somewhere uh, together?

19:59.232 --> 20:00.565
- Yeah.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.899
- Yeah?

20:01.901 --> 20:02.733
- Yeah.

20:02.735 --> 20:03.568
- Yeah?

20:03.570 --> 20:04.402
- Yeah (laughs).

20:04.404 --> 20:05.670
- Okay, good.

20:05.672 --> 20:06.470
Right uh, cool now I
have to go to class.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.305
- Uh, me too.

20:07.307 --> 20:07.939
- Uh, okay all right.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.874
Yeah, maybe later?

20:09.876 --> 20:10.708
- Later?

20:10.710 --> 20:11.642
- This afternoon?

20:11.644 --> 20:12.643
- [Sue] Oh, uh yeah.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.245
Yeah, yes.
- Okay good.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.614
(Sue laughs)

20:16.616 --> 20:17.548
See ya.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.850
- [Sue] Bye (chuckles).

20:19.852 --> 20:20.985
- [Lenia] Sue!

20:20.987 --> 20:23.654
(gentle music)

20:38.304 --> 20:42.006
- Some of the NT26D touched
your skin during the explosion.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.275
It's a genetically
modified substance

20:44.277 --> 20:45.843
that I've developed
and it's intended

20:45.845 --> 20:49.247
to cure our bodies of
diseases or injuries.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.983
The NT26D must've
entered your skin.

20:51.985 --> 20:53.251
Here...

20:55.455 --> 20:56.621
(Sue gasps)

20:56.623 --> 20:58.356
- It really worked.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.657
The wound is gone.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.426
The NT26D took care of it.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.296
- I, I'm gonna take a
few measurements now

21:05.298 --> 21:09.433
to get a better idea of
what's happening exactly.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.901
Here.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.604
Snap it and it'll turn
extremely hot and then...

21:13.606 --> 21:16.574
(mysterious music)

21:19.012 --> 21:21.412
- [Lenia] Unbelievable.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.750
- [Sue] Hurry up please,
this doesn't feel great.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.419
(gentle music)

21:29.722 --> 21:30.621
- Uh, Sue?

21:31.557 --> 21:32.490
May I?

21:32.492 --> 21:33.724
- [Sue] Sure, yeah.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.558
(Lenia gasps)

21:34.560 --> 21:35.593
- Is this your hand?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.495
- [Sue] Yeah.

21:37.497 --> 21:41.465
- [Lenia] Oh my God (gasping)!

21:43.403 --> 21:45.569
- [Sue] Everything I
touch becomes invisible.

21:45.571 --> 21:48.005
- Seems like it's
transmitted by skin contact.

21:48.007 --> 21:52.877
(Lenia gasping)
(mysterious music)

21:52.879 --> 21:53.911
How strange.

21:55.315 --> 21:58.482
I feel so powerful
like a super hero.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.352
- The NT26D molecules
are mutating.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.356
They merge with red
blood cells and activate

22:05.358 --> 22:07.325
as soon as the
body temperature--

22:07.327 --> 22:08.092
- [Lenia] It's pretty fast.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.894
- Yes, faster then I thought.

22:09.896 --> 22:14.665
The warmer it gets the
longer she'll stay invisible.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.833
- And what does that mean?

22:15.835 --> 22:18.102
(computer beeping)

22:18.104 --> 22:21.472
- We have to destroy
it, immediately.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.708
- [Lenia] You wanna do what?

22:23.710 --> 22:25.443
- Lenia, just think about it.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.446
Yeah, maybe the NT26D can heal,

22:28.448 --> 22:30.381
but what if those who
take it become invisible

22:30.383 --> 22:32.783
or have even worse side
effects like mutation?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.518
- Then we have to start
again from scratch.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.620
- [Maria] It's my decision.

22:36.622 --> 22:37.855
- Please Maria.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.957
Let's recheck the data
and run some more tests.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.992
- Mom, what are you doing?

22:41.994 --> 22:43.894
You, you can't do that.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.397
If you delete everything
you can't make the antidote.

22:46.399 --> 22:49.467
(tense music)

22:49.469 --> 22:52.136
- Susanna, I can explain
it to you but not now.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.938
We'll talk later, okay?

22:53.940 --> 22:56.140
- You need the data
to reverse it, Mom.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.675
(tense music)

22:57.677 --> 22:59.510
You're never there for me.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.511
- [Maria] Susanna!

23:00.513 --> 23:01.779
- No, my name is Sue.

23:01.781 --> 23:05.383
(mellow dramatic music)

23:19.732 --> 23:24.802
(gentle music)
(robot chattering)

23:27.006 --> 23:28.439
- Bad spot to take a nap.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.409
(robot chattering)

23:35.515 --> 23:36.147
Hey, girl.

23:36.149 --> 23:37.047
Wake up.

23:37.049 --> 23:40.618
Come on, I'm not waking
you up with a kiss.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.621
(robot chattering)

23:47.960 --> 23:49.193
(water splashing)
(Sue gasps)

23:49.195 --> 23:50.094
- What?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.730
Am I, can you see me?

23:53.833 --> 23:54.732
- Um, yes.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.702
(robot chattering)

23:58.704 --> 24:03.107
(upbeat music)
(diner members chattering)

24:03.109 --> 24:04.442
Oh, just great.

24:05.745 --> 24:06.577
Hey.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.878
Sue, what's up?

24:08.714 --> 24:10.548
You said it's urgent.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.517
(Sue groans)

24:13.519 --> 24:18.155
- Sorry, must have something
to do with uh, that thing.

24:19.525 --> 24:20.458
- That thing?

24:21.861 --> 24:24.628
(Sue sighs)

24:24.630 --> 24:28.632
¶ And then I mess with you ¶

24:28.634 --> 24:30.935
- Please don't laugh at me.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.938
You heard of mutation research?

24:33.940 --> 24:37.107
Because, I can make
myself invisible.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.148
(Kaya scoffs)

24:44.150 --> 24:46.116
- Oh my God, you
really are nuts.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.551
- No, please I need your help.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.753
- And what do we have here huh?

24:49.755 --> 24:52.256
Freak one and
freak two (laughs).

24:52.258 --> 24:55.125
- Oh hey, I'd say hello
with some yodeling but uh,

24:55.127 --> 24:57.228
I'm not as into it as you are.
- What?

24:57.230 --> 24:58.562
Are you crazy?

24:58.564 --> 24:59.563
It was you outside, right?

24:59.565 --> 25:00.598
You hacked into my phone.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.832
You are so dead

25:01.834 --> 25:03.634
you crazy psycho!
- Let me go now!

25:03.636 --> 25:04.535
- Or what?

25:06.606 --> 25:09.807
(liquid splashing)
(Eileen screams)

25:09.809 --> 25:11.275
- [Sue] Hey, you piece of trash?

25:11.277 --> 25:12.510
Over here!

25:12.512 --> 25:13.511
Over here.

25:13.513 --> 25:18.215
(Eileen sobbing)
(playful music)

25:19.886 --> 25:22.653
(eerie music)

25:31.597 --> 25:34.632
(Kaya gasps)

25:34.634 --> 25:35.533
- Awesome.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.536
(bell dings)

25:38.538 --> 25:40.671
(Maria laughs)

25:42.942 --> 25:44.275
- [Sue] What?

25:44.276 --> 25:45.609
- Just imagining Eileen
wit fries and ketchup.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.177
- You can laugh, but I'm at

25:47.179 --> 25:50.080
the top of her
hit list now, Mom.

25:50.082 --> 25:53.817
I'm not just a freak
but I'm dead meat, too.

25:57.189 --> 26:00.658
- I'm a terrible person
for laughing, aren't I?

26:00.660 --> 26:01.725
- Yeah.

26:04.664 --> 26:07.698
- This project means
everything to me,

26:09.201 --> 26:12.069
and I don't have a clue
why there was an explosion.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.672
It never should've happened.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.009
I'm afraid we have to
go into hiding for now.

26:19.011 --> 26:22.646
If somebody finds out
what the NT26D can do,

26:22.648 --> 26:25.983
what you can do, we
won't be safe any longer.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.752
(eerie music)

26:33.759 --> 26:38.696
(footsteps receding)
(eerie music)

26:38.698 --> 26:39.763
- Dr. Drill?

26:40.967 --> 26:41.865
Dr. Drill?

26:43.703 --> 26:45.102
The videos you
asked for are here.

26:45.104 --> 26:45.936
- Oh, thanks.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.706
(eerie music)

27:01.387 --> 27:04.388
Tell me, has anyone
else seen this?

27:05.358 --> 27:07.191
- No, just me.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.760
(tense music)

27:14.166 --> 27:19.236
(thunder booming)
(rain pattering)

27:23.676 --> 27:28.746
(windshield wipers whirring)
(engine rumbling)

27:30.216 --> 27:31.115
- Hm?

27:32.218 --> 27:33.684
Should I carry you
into the house?

27:33.686 --> 27:36.286
(rain pattering)

27:42.428 --> 27:43.427
Come on, honey.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.395
Come on now.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.429
Come on.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.832
(Maria screams)
(dramatic music)

27:48.834 --> 27:49.767
Help!

27:49.769 --> 27:51.168
Somebody help!

27:51.170 --> 27:52.369
Susanna!

27:52.371 --> 27:53.270
Susanna!

27:54.273 --> 27:55.239
- [Sue] Mom?

27:55.241 --> 27:57.174
- Susanna, find Alfred!
- Mom!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.143
- And the red mask.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.444
Alfred!

28:00.446 --> 28:05.683
(Maria screaming)
(dramatic music)

28:15.094 --> 28:15.926
(alarm blaring)

28:15.928 --> 28:16.927
- [Man] She's gone!

28:16.929 --> 28:21.832
(alarm blaring)
(dramatic music)

28:26.772 --> 28:27.838
- [Sue] Mom!

28:28.708 --> 28:29.473
Mom!

28:29.475 --> 28:34.812
(rain pattering)
(tense music)

28:36.816 --> 28:37.448
- [Christopher] What?

28:37.450 --> 28:38.982
Sue, calm down.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.719
No, slowly, what happened?

28:41.721 --> 28:43.287
- Dad, Mom's been kidnapped.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.121
We're in trouble.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.789
You have to believe me.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.192
I can make myself invisible
because of that NT from the lab.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.193
- [Christopher] Invisible?

28:49.195 --> 28:50.294
Uh, okay.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.962
Maybe Mom can give me some too.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.363
Then I'll be invisible.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.865
Sound check's about to start.

28:54.867 --> 28:55.799
I'll call back.

28:55.801 --> 28:56.834
- You have to believe me.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.001
Come on, please.

28:58.003 --> 28:58.902
Come on.

28:58.904 --> 28:59.937
(phone beeping)

28:59.939 --> 29:00.771
Come on!

29:00.773 --> 29:02.339
(Sue groans)

29:02.341 --> 29:07.411
(doorbell rings)
(knocking)

29:08.280 --> 29:13.050
(rain pattering)
(dramatic music)

29:20.226 --> 29:22.860
(bike ticking)

29:38.377 --> 29:40.043
- Hi, are you okay?

29:41.981 --> 29:43.480
- I need your help Tobi.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.849
- [Tobi] What's wrong?

29:45.851 --> 29:47.384
- It's all my fault.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.054
My mother's been kidnapped.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.556
(tense music)

29:52.558 --> 29:55.225
I just thought she was crazy.

29:55.227 --> 29:58.862
She told me not to go
out and tell anybody.

30:00.800 --> 30:05.903
(Sue sobs)
(somber music)

30:19.351 --> 30:22.486
- [Tobi] Here, it's
all I could find.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.324
- [Sue] Thank you.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.559
- My mother's on night shift

30:28.561 --> 30:32.162
and my father's only
here on weekends.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.565
That's why we moved,
to change that.

30:34.567 --> 30:35.999
So you can sleep here tonight.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.601
I'm here by myself most
of the time anyway.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.837
(eerie music)

30:39.839 --> 30:41.605
But we better call the police.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.940
- [Sue] No.

30:42.942 --> 30:43.574
No police.

30:43.576 --> 30:44.408
- But why?

30:44.410 --> 30:47.377
(mysterious music)

30:52.484 --> 30:53.917
Sue?

30:53.919 --> 30:54.551
(Sue sighs)

30:54.553 --> 30:55.619
- [Sue] Not again.

30:55.621 --> 30:56.486
The tea.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.489
- [Tobi] Are you?

31:00.392 --> 31:05.429
(rain pattering)
(eerie music)

31:07.533 --> 31:10.868
- Can you give me the blanket?

31:10.870 --> 31:11.568
Tobi?

31:12.605 --> 31:13.570
Tobi?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.939
(Tobi panting)
(rain pattering)

31:15.941 --> 31:16.907
- I'm sorry.

31:16.909 --> 31:21.912
(rain pattering)
(gentle music)

31:26.185 --> 31:28.919
(door latches)

31:28.921 --> 31:30.354
You were invisible.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.123
- I know.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.662
- Awesome (laughs)!

31:38.664 --> 31:40.230
- Eileen is right.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.033
I'm a freak.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.569
- A freak?

31:45.571 --> 31:48.438
- [Sue] Why did
this happen to me?

31:49.508 --> 31:51.341
- You can make
yourself invisible.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.010
How cool is that?

31:53.979 --> 31:56.079
You're a real super hero.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.918
Think about Super Moon.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.654
First, she hid in
the basement, right?

32:03.656 --> 32:06.423
She believe people
thought she was a monster.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.993
Or they chase her for
her powers until...

32:09.995 --> 32:11.228
- Her parents were robbed

32:11.230 --> 32:12.696
and her little
brother was kidnapped.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.515
- Exactly.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.333
And then she went out
and blew them all away.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.102
She destroyed everyone with
her gigantic moon scream,

32:19.104 --> 32:21.405
her Super Moon moon scream.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.541
(Sue sighs)

32:24.543 --> 32:26.977
- Thank you, Tobias Grimm.

32:29.949 --> 32:33.016
- Uh, um, you can
have the mattress.

32:33.686 --> 32:36.954
I can make something
to eat for you.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.256
Sue?

32:39.258 --> 32:42.125
(gentle music)

32:43.529 --> 32:46.630
(Tobi chuckles)

32:46.632 --> 32:49.533
Then I'll take the mattress.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.302
(birds chirping)

32:55.307 --> 32:56.673
Super heroes always
have a sidekick

32:56.675 --> 32:59.009
but I'm not sure
how I can help you.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.678
The only thing I'm
good at is cycling.

33:01.680 --> 33:06.216
- First, we have to find
out who kidnapped my mother.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.018
The black van was over there.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.053
Mom kept shouting that I need

33:10.055 --> 33:14.624
to go find some guy named
Alfred, and a red mask.

33:14.626 --> 33:18.128
I don't know any Alfred
or about a red mask so.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.630
- I still think we
should go to the police.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.032
- And say what?

33:22.034 --> 33:24.067
My mom made a liquid
that makes me invisible

33:24.069 --> 33:27.471
and that's why
she was kidnapped?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.740
- You're right, it sounds
totally reasonable.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.641
(latches rattling)

33:31.643 --> 33:33.510
- [Sue] Have you ever
broken into a car?

33:33.512 --> 33:34.444
- Me?

33:34.446 --> 33:35.679
What makes you think that?

33:35.681 --> 33:39.016
(horn beeps)

33:39.018 --> 33:39.750
Tell me that that was you.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.051
- Uh uh.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.154
(Sue sighs)

33:44.156 --> 33:45.222
- [Tobi] Sue?

33:45.224 --> 33:46.423
- My mom's laptop.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.291
Maybe there's something
about Alfred on it.

33:48.293 --> 33:53.363
(phone ringing)
(phone vibrating)

33:56.468 --> 33:57.768
Hello?

33:57.770 --> 33:59.436
- [Female Robotic Voice]
You're getting visitors.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.103
Make yourself invisible
and hide that clown.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.606
- What are you
saying, who is this?

34:02.608 --> 34:04.074
- [Female Robotic
Voice] Trust me.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.743
I have information
about your mother.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.411
- I don't have anymore pocket
warmers, without them--

34:07.413 --> 34:08.445
- [Female Robotic Voice] Get in.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.414
(mellow dramatic music)

34:10.416 --> 34:11.481
- Get in, fast.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.416
- Really?

34:12.418 --> 34:14.583
'Cause a voice tells you to?

34:14.585 --> 34:17.120
- Do you have a better idea?

34:17.121 --> 34:19.156
- Run away!

34:19.157 --> 34:21.190
- [Female Robotic Voice]
You've got 10 seconds left.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.260
- I'll wake up any second and
this was all just a nightmare.

34:23.262 --> 34:24.293
- [Female Robotic Voice] Seven.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.763
(mellow dramatic music)

34:26.764 --> 34:27.597
Three.

34:27.599 --> 34:31.101
(mellow dramatic music)

34:31.103 --> 34:34.204
(engine rumbling)

34:38.177 --> 34:40.143
- [Dr. Drill] You, check
the house but be careful.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.895
Don't frighten the girl

34:41.896 --> 34:43.646
and take the car
back to the company.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.148
- [Man] Understood, Sir.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.318
(door slams)
(engine rumbling)

34:48.320 --> 34:49.553
- Great, what now?

34:49.554 --> 34:50.387
- Shh.

34:50.389 --> 34:54.190
(mellow dramatic music)

34:54.193 --> 34:59.262
(engine rumbling)
(mellow dramatic music)

35:01.467 --> 35:03.533
- [Kaya] Excuse me,
could you help me?

35:03.535 --> 35:05.168
I'm contacting crazy.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.369
- [Man] Oh.

35:06.371 --> 35:09.172
(man groaning)
(machine whirring)

35:09.174 --> 35:12.209
(dramatic music)

35:12.878 --> 35:16.213
- I'm not interrupting
anything am I?

35:18.617 --> 35:19.883
- [Tobi] Where are we?

35:19.885 --> 35:22.619
- The DEC, the Drill
Energy Corporation.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.688
Wasn't easy to get in here.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.756
- [Sue] Were you following
us all the way here?

35:26.758 --> 35:27.657
- Yep.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.861
(man groans)
(Sue gasps)

35:30.863 --> 35:31.795
Don't worry, he's just having

35:31.797 --> 35:34.264
a nap like the guy at the gate.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.432
I put the video
surveillance on loop.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.666
We better hurry.

35:36.668 --> 35:37.868
It won't be long 'til
they figure it out.

35:37.870 --> 35:38.702
Come on.

35:38.704 --> 35:39.703
Follow me.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.306
(man groans)

35:46.145 --> 35:49.246
(Sue panting)

35:49.248 --> 35:50.714
- [Tobi] Is she on the team now?

35:50.715 --> 35:52.181
- [App] What are
you talking about?

35:52.184 --> 35:53.717
- Tobi, this is App.

35:53.719 --> 35:54.818
App, Tobi.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.520
- [Tobi] App, like on a phone?

35:56.522 --> 35:58.822
- Yeah, got a problem with it?

35:58.824 --> 35:59.723
- No.

36:02.861 --> 36:03.894
(device beeps)

36:03.896 --> 36:05.629
- Here, have a look.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.466
That's the car your
mother was kidnapped in.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.901
I wanted to show you yesterday.

36:10.903 --> 36:15.172
I even rang your doorbell
but you didn't answer.

36:16.275 --> 36:19.609
The van is registered to
the Drill Corporation.

36:19.611 --> 36:23.346
I think Drill wants to force
her to produce the NT26D.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.814
- And how does
she know all that?

36:24.816 --> 36:27.651
- Because she has a brain.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.386
- [Sue] I'm going
in there right now.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.287
- [Tobi] Sue!

36:30.289 --> 36:33.690
(mellow dramatic music)

36:41.233 --> 36:41.865
What's your plan?

36:41.867 --> 36:43.300
- To get my mother out.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.336
- [Tobi] Do I have
to go in there too?

36:46.338 --> 36:47.771
- Yeah.

36:47.773 --> 36:50.440
- [App] Here, you'll
need some pocket warmers.

36:50.442 --> 36:51.675
- You're such a genius.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.243
- I know.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.244
Here.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.913
That's how we'll
stay in contact.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.984
And with that I can see
exactly where you go.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.319
- All right guys, let's do this.

37:02.321 --> 37:02.953
Come on.

37:02.955 --> 37:05.755
(mellow dramatic music)

37:08.627 --> 37:09.042
- Sue, wait.

37:09.043 --> 37:09.458
(Tobi chuckles)
(mellow dramatic music)

37:09.461 --> 37:10.360
My arm.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.296
Awesome.

37:13.298 --> 37:14.331
Invisible man.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.266
- Awesome.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.336
- [Sue] Hold my hand
tight and don't let go.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.904
- [Tobi] Aye, Sir.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.624
- But did you follow my recipe?

37:23.625 --> 37:25.242
- I don't know why it
didn't turn out right.

37:25.244 --> 37:25.875
- What did you do?

37:25.877 --> 37:26.710
- I ate--

37:26.712 --> 37:27.677
- Tobi!
- Sue!

37:27.679 --> 37:32.449
(Sue gasps)
(Tobi groans)

37:34.353 --> 37:35.252
Hi.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.622
- [Scientist] Oh my
God, are you okay?

37:38.624 --> 37:39.556
- Uh--

37:39.558 --> 37:41.291
- How did you get in here?

37:41.293 --> 37:42.025
- I don't know.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.895
I was in school a second ago,

37:44.896 --> 37:47.764
and then there was this uh,
this pain and a red light.

37:47.766 --> 37:51.368
And then it just, a
portal yeah, opened.

37:53.538 --> 37:54.938
It was gigantic.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.574
- [Sue] Come on!

37:57.576 --> 37:58.475
- Oh!

38:04.016 --> 38:08.518
(mellow dramatic music)
(Sue panting)

38:08.520 --> 38:10.453
- [Sue] I told
you not to let go!

38:10.455 --> 38:11.888
- You just ran into her.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.658
- Mom (panting)!

38:14.660 --> 38:15.492
Mom!

38:15.494 --> 38:17.827
Mom (panting)!

38:17.829 --> 38:19.362
- [Tobi] It's all empty.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.597
There's nobody here.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.599
- [App] I'm getting
a third signal.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.900
Could be from another cellphone.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.302
Maybe Sue's mom's?

38:25.304 --> 38:26.503
(Sue exhaling)

38:26.505 --> 38:28.905
- [Tobi] Are you okay?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.473
- No, I feel like,

38:31.610 --> 38:34.544
it seems like two people
makes me twice as tired.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.446
(Sue sighs)

38:36.448 --> 38:37.347
- Don't fall asleep okay?

38:37.349 --> 38:38.415
You hear me?

38:38.417 --> 38:40.850
(Sue sighs)

38:40.852 --> 38:43.386
Did you really
think she'd be here?

38:43.388 --> 38:46.523
(objects clattering)

38:49.328 --> 38:50.527
Sue?

38:50.529 --> 38:53.096
Hey, I found something.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.665
(tense music)

39:00.405 --> 39:01.471
Sue?

39:02.441 --> 39:03.340
Sue?

39:05.711 --> 39:06.710
Just great.

39:07.813 --> 39:12.582
(dramatic music)
(tires screeching)

39:13.685 --> 39:15.085
- [Dr. Drill] Bertie,
search the building.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.453
The children are in there.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.054
- [App] Hey guys, they found us.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.424
You should leave
as fast as you can.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.525
- Sue you gotta wake up.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.828
(tense music)

39:24.830 --> 39:27.964
- I don't wanna rush you but
they're heading right for you.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.100
(tense music)

39:30.102 --> 39:31.000
- Man!

39:33.004 --> 39:34.604
(sighs)

39:34.606 --> 39:37.474
(gentle music)

39:40.812 --> 39:41.644
(Sue gasps)

39:41.646 --> 39:43.012
- Hey!

39:43.014 --> 39:44.147
What are you doing?

39:44.149 --> 39:45.582
- I wanted to wake you up.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.117
- You know I'm not
Sleeping Beauty,

39:47.119 --> 39:48.551
right?
- Yeah.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.621
- [Sue] Where did you get that?

39:51.623 --> 39:53.790
- I found it and a phone too.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.392
- [App] You have 10 seconds.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.193
Get out!

39:56.194 --> 39:56.993
- [Dr. Drill] Did
you see the kids?

39:56.995 --> 39:58.061
Where?

39:58.063 --> 39:58.995
- That way.
- It was only one child.

39:58.997 --> 39:59.996
- There?
- Over here.

39:59.998 --> 40:00.930
- Fell down here
- I don't know.

40:00.932 --> 40:01.464
- and then he disappeared.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.632
- Come.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.100
- Tobi, why do you
only stutter sometimes?

40:04.102 --> 40:05.502
- Do we have to
talk about it now?

40:05.504 --> 40:06.536
- [Sue] Yeah.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.470
(Tobi sighs)

40:07.472 --> 40:09.038
- It happens when I get nervous.

40:09.040 --> 40:09.973
- Like now?

40:09.975 --> 40:11.541
- Would you please hurry?

40:11.543 --> 40:13.643
- [Sue] Don't panic,
I'll get us out of here.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.146
(mellow dramatic music)

40:16.148 --> 40:18.415
- The kids must
still be in here.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.849
Seal the whole building.

40:19.851 --> 40:23.653
(mellow dramatic music)

40:23.655 --> 40:24.954
- [Man] The children are gone.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.489
We need an infra red camera.

40:26.491 --> 40:29.159
(mellow dramatic music)

40:29.161 --> 40:30.059
- Damn!

40:31.696 --> 40:34.464
- [Tobi] How are we
gonna get out of here?

40:34.466 --> 40:36.900
- [Sue] Stay behind me.

40:36.902 --> 40:37.734
Okay, come on.

40:37.736 --> 40:38.968
Now.

40:38.970 --> 40:43.606
(radios chattering)
(pensive music)

40:44.843 --> 40:46.543
- [Tobi] How long can
you stay invisible?

40:46.545 --> 40:48.645
- [Sue] Probably
'til I fall asleep.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.680
- [Tobi] And it
happens every time?

40:50.682 --> 40:51.781
- [Sue] Yep.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.949
¶ La la la ¶

40:52.951 --> 40:54.918
¶ La la la la ¶

40:54.920 --> 40:56.920
¶ La la la ¶

40:56.922 --> 40:58.855
¶ La la la la ¶

40:58.857 --> 40:59.823
(Sue panting)

40:59.825 --> 41:01.758
(Sue gulping)

41:01.760 --> 41:03.693
- [Tobi] Soda, for what?

41:03.695 --> 41:05.929
- [Sue] Better then
kissing me awake, right?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.464
- [Tobi] I'm your sidekick.

41:07.466 --> 41:08.631
Just be professional.

41:08.633 --> 41:09.933
- [Sue] Uh huh.

41:11.670 --> 41:12.769
We almost made it.

41:12.771 --> 41:13.703
Come on.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.071
Around the corner (panting).

41:15.073 --> 41:15.972
- [Tobi] Look out!

41:15.974 --> 41:16.906
Two guards.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.609
- [Sue] I see them (panting).

41:19.611 --> 41:21.978
- [Tobi] Behind the cabinet.

41:21.980 --> 41:22.812
Duck down.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.514
(radio chattering)

41:24.516 --> 41:25.548
Okay, head for the door.

41:25.550 --> 41:26.182
Go!

41:26.184 --> 41:27.116
Go!

41:27.118 --> 41:28.051
Faster, we have to get out.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.119
Watch out Tobi, the door!

41:30.121 --> 41:30.954
- [Tobi] Oh!

41:30.956 --> 41:32.222
(dramatic music)

41:32.224 --> 41:33.523
- Whoa.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.157
- [Man] They're out the door.

41:34.159 --> 41:34.991
Move, move, move!

41:34.993 --> 41:35.825
They're out the door.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.628
(dramatic music)

41:43.502 --> 41:45.235
- Aw, stupid automatic door.

41:45.237 --> 41:46.269
- There they are.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.504
- Seize them.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.738
They're heading east
towards the refinery.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.507
- Any suggestions?

41:50.509 --> 41:52.075
- [Sue] Just have a sleep and
I'll make us invisible again.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.943
(bike bell dings)

41:53.945 --> 41:54.777
- [App] Hop on.

41:54.779 --> 41:55.645
- [Tobi] On that thing?

41:55.647 --> 41:56.913
- Come on Tobi!

41:56.915 --> 41:58.281
Aren't you the show
off on a bicycle?

41:58.283 --> 41:59.916
- [Tobi] Yeah, on a bicycle.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.585
- Then pretend it's a bicycle!

42:03.522 --> 42:04.287
Go!

42:04.289 --> 42:07.891
(dramatic music)
(App screams)

42:07.893 --> 42:09.125
- [Guard] Stop!

42:09.127 --> 42:10.593
You're trespassing
on private property!

42:10.595 --> 42:11.861
- Whoa!
- Seize them!

42:11.863 --> 42:13.263
- What is that thing?

42:13.265 --> 42:14.597
- A flux capacitor.

42:14.599 --> 42:15.932
- A what?

42:15.934 --> 42:17.534
Whoa!

42:17.536 --> 42:18.568
- No!

42:18.570 --> 42:20.069
(dramatic music)

42:20.071 --> 42:20.904
(girls screaming)
(dramatic music)

42:20.906 --> 42:21.738
- Hey!

42:21.740 --> 42:23.206
(Sue screams)

42:23.208 --> 42:24.807
(tires screeching)
(dramatic music)

42:24.809 --> 42:27.043
- [Sue] Tobi, your life or all.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.612
(tense music)

42:30.782 --> 42:32.315
(sighs)

42:32.317 --> 42:34.083
- [Tobi] That was so awesome.

42:34.085 --> 42:35.218
I was invisible.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.020
You really have to try it App.

42:37.022 --> 42:39.122
- [App] No, that's
your specialty.

42:39.124 --> 42:42.592
We should hide at
my place tonight.

42:42.594 --> 42:45.061
Drill won't look for us here.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.832
- Wow (laughs).

42:49.834 --> 42:53.303
Now I know how you could afford
all those gadgets of yours.

42:53.305 --> 42:54.837
- It's my aunts house.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.639
We're just allowed to live here.

42:56.641 --> 42:59.642
(birds chirping)

43:00.312 --> 43:02.612
- [Sue] Hey guys,
thanks for helping me.

43:02.614 --> 43:03.780
I'd be lost without you.

43:03.782 --> 43:07.016
(gentle music)

43:07.018 --> 43:11.321
(door latches)
(gentle music)

43:11.323 --> 43:14.991
My aunt is in a wheelchair,
so don't be surprised.

43:14.993 --> 43:17.327
Oh, and she's a bit, weird.

43:19.331 --> 43:21.064
(wheelchair whirring)

43:21.066 --> 43:24.834
- Kaya, darling, I see you
brought some friends over?

43:25.904 --> 43:27.203
- Yes Aunt Laur.

43:27.205 --> 43:29.672
Could they stay
here for the night?

43:29.674 --> 43:31.107
- Of course they can.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.976
I'll call your mother.

43:32.978 --> 43:35.044
She can bring home
something to eat.

43:35.046 --> 43:35.878
- Cool.

43:35.880 --> 43:36.713
Thank you.

43:36.715 --> 43:38.615
Uh, we'll be upstairs.

43:40.185 --> 43:41.084
- Susanne?

43:41.987 --> 43:43.953
Oh, pardon me.

43:43.955 --> 43:49.025
Sue, would you have a moment
for me darling, please?

43:49.361 --> 43:49.959
- Uh, yeah.

43:50.895 --> 43:53.396
- I'll see you in the library.

43:53.398 --> 43:57.000
(footsteps approaching)

44:04.743 --> 44:06.676
- [Sue] Uh, are you okay?

44:06.678 --> 44:09.479
Anything I can bring you?

44:09.480 --> 44:12.281
- That's very kind of you
Sue, but I'm fine for now.

44:13.418 --> 44:16.986
Some days my body just won't
do what I need it to do.

44:16.988 --> 44:20.056
- [Sue] Um, how do
you know my name?

44:25.697 --> 44:27.830
Mom, Lenia and is that you?

44:29.167 --> 44:30.366
- Hm.

44:30.368 --> 44:31.868
Your mother was
the best one in all

44:31.870 --> 44:34.771
those years at the university.

44:34.773 --> 44:39.842
Ambitious, determined and
(laughs) incredibly naive.

44:40.979 --> 44:44.414
But in the end we had
a fight and fell out.

44:44.416 --> 44:46.049
She was obsessed with the idea

44:46.051 --> 44:49.852
of creating the
perfect healthy body,

44:49.854 --> 44:53.056
and she wanted to sell
the NT26D to the DEC

44:53.058 --> 44:57.727
and I did warn her but she
didn't wanna listen to me.

45:00.765 --> 45:04.333
Do pass on my warmest
regards to her.

45:04.335 --> 45:05.735
- Yeah, all right.

45:05.737 --> 45:08.004
I'll do that, when I see her.

45:08.006 --> 45:10.873
(gentle music)

45:12.177 --> 45:17.080
That Drill guy from the factory,
I think, is he dangerous?

45:19.017 --> 45:20.750
- People are often
not what they seem.

45:20.752 --> 45:22.719
You can't be too careful.

45:22.721 --> 45:26.989
(tense music)
(footsteps receding)

45:26.991 --> 45:28.491
(device beeping)

45:28.493 --> 45:29.459
- [App] Sue?

45:29.461 --> 45:33.763
(device beeping)
(gentle music)

45:33.765 --> 45:35.298
What did my aunt want with you?

45:35.300 --> 45:37.934
- Uh, she knows my
mom from university.

45:37.936 --> 45:38.868
Long story.

45:38.870 --> 45:40.503
So, did you find anything?

45:40.505 --> 45:44.040
- I got into your
mom's cellphone.

45:44.042 --> 45:44.874
Oh, look.

45:44.876 --> 45:45.875
There's a video on it.

45:45.877 --> 45:48.778
(tense music)

45:48.780 --> 45:53.416
(Maria panting)
(dramatic music)

45:53.418 --> 45:54.817
- I've been kidnapped.

45:54.819 --> 45:56.886
Whoever finds this,
protect my daughter.

45:56.888 --> 45:57.987
(Maria groans)

45:57.989 --> 45:59.922
(man chattering)
(dramatic music)

45:59.924 --> 46:04.927
(static crackling)
(tense music)

46:07.265 --> 46:08.131
- Play it again.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.500
(tense music)

46:10.502 --> 46:14.137
(static crackling)
(tense music)

46:14.139 --> 46:14.971
Where is that?

46:14.973 --> 46:16.939
(tense music)

46:16.941 --> 46:18.975
(Sue groans)
(chair clattering)

46:18.977 --> 46:20.543
- [Male Robotic Voice]
Violence is never the answer.

46:20.545 --> 46:21.861
- What was that?

46:21.862 --> 46:23.178
- [App] It came
from your mom's bag.

46:23.181 --> 46:25.948
(tense music)

46:30.088 --> 46:31.420
- The red mask.

46:32.557 --> 46:34.323
(device beeps)
(Sue gasps)

46:34.325 --> 46:37.226
(device whirring)

46:40.231 --> 46:42.899
- [Male Robotic Voice] Please
say what kind of scientific,

46:42.901 --> 46:45.034
Miss Susanne, welcome back.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.137
Please don't throw any cake.

46:48.139 --> 46:51.340
- You're the voice I
heard in the laboratory.

46:51.342 --> 46:52.575
- [Male Robotic Voice]
That is correct.

46:52.577 --> 46:53.726
- [Sue] What are you?

46:53.727 --> 46:54.876
- [Male Robotic Voice]
What I am exceeds

46:54.879 --> 46:57.280
your wildest imagination.

46:57.282 --> 46:58.848
Just call me Alfred.

46:58.850 --> 46:59.882
- Alfred?

46:59.884 --> 47:01.184
You're the Alfred?

47:01.186 --> 47:02.285
- [Alfred] That is correct.

47:02.287 --> 47:04.120
- Where is Dr. Hartmann?

47:04.122 --> 47:05.254
Who kidnapped her?

47:05.256 --> 47:06.856
(device beeping)

47:06.858 --> 47:08.324
- [Alfred] It has spoken to me.

47:08.326 --> 47:10.276
- [Tobi] Does he mean me?

47:10.277 --> 47:12.227
- [Alfred] My I point out
only Hartmann family members

47:12.230 --> 47:14.931
can access my database.

47:14.933 --> 47:16.866
- Where's my mother?

47:16.868 --> 47:18.901
- [Alfred] Unfortunately, I
do not have sufficient data

47:18.903 --> 47:20.403
for a complete analysis.

47:20.405 --> 47:21.904
- [Lisa] Hello!

47:23.141 --> 47:24.373
- Out, fast!

47:24.375 --> 47:26.576
- [Alfred] I beg your
pardon, I am not a dog.

47:26.578 --> 47:28.578
- Turn off, please.
- Kaya!

47:28.580 --> 47:29.912
- [Alfred] As you
wish Miss Susanna.

47:29.914 --> 47:31.347
(device whirring)

47:31.349 --> 47:32.215
- Hi.

47:32.217 --> 47:33.115
Hi.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.587
I'm Lisa, Kaya's mother.

47:39.891 --> 47:41.457
I'm really sorry (chuckles).

47:41.459 --> 47:43.559
If I had known I'd have
cooked something proper.

47:43.561 --> 47:47.897
A spaghetti, lasagna, but
there's just pizza now.

47:50.401 --> 47:51.500
- [App] This is great Mom.

47:51.502 --> 47:52.335
- [Tobi] Pizza's great.

47:52.337 --> 47:53.169
- [App] Thank you.

47:53.171 --> 47:54.136
(Lisa sighs)

47:54.138 --> 47:55.271
- Well, I'm not here.

47:55.273 --> 47:58.908
I'm invisible
practically speaking.

47:58.910 --> 47:59.942
- Mom, please.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.178
- Oh.

48:03.314 --> 48:04.213
Okay.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.148
(Lisa sighs)

48:06.150 --> 48:08.951
Woo (laughs)!

48:08.953 --> 48:09.986
Have fun.

48:09.988 --> 48:11.888
(footsteps receding)

48:11.890 --> 48:15.091
- I don't have
friends over often.

48:15.093 --> 48:17.660
In fact, you're the first ones.

48:17.662 --> 48:19.929
- And the robotics club?

48:19.931 --> 48:23.065
- That's just me and
sometimes also me.

48:23.935 --> 48:24.934
I'm a loner.

48:24.936 --> 48:27.603
I'm just not good with others.

48:27.605 --> 48:28.504
Salami?

48:29.607 --> 48:31.674
- App, we broke
into the DEC today

48:31.676 --> 48:33.976
and got out without
getting caught.

48:33.978 --> 48:38.047
We could've never have done
that without you there.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.115
- Mm, Sue's right.

48:39.117 --> 48:41.984
(gentle music)

48:43.187 --> 48:47.123
- Uh, I'll have the cheese
pizza and I'm not sharing.

48:49.627 --> 48:52.695
(phone vibrating)

48:52.697 --> 48:54.664
- [Alfred] It is
always a pleasure.

48:54.666 --> 48:56.632
Welcome back Miss Susanna.

48:56.634 --> 48:58.301
- [Sue] Sue, my name is Sue.

48:58.303 --> 48:59.502
- [Alfred] Oh, pardon me.

48:59.504 --> 49:00.636
Miss Sue.

49:00.638 --> 49:02.705
- What did Dr.
Hartmann use you for?

49:02.707 --> 49:05.308
(device whirs)

49:05.310 --> 49:06.475
Oh, this is ridiculous.

49:06.477 --> 49:07.944
It's only a machine.

49:07.946 --> 49:09.512
- [Alfred] I'm able to
access 10 to the power

49:09.514 --> 49:12.682
of 367 processed
in a millisecond,

49:12.684 --> 49:15.551
while you can't even
master simple algebra, Sir.

49:15.553 --> 49:17.053
- How does it know that?

49:17.055 --> 49:17.987
- Stop it.

49:17.989 --> 49:20.723
Better answer his question.

49:20.725 --> 49:21.724
- [Alfred] After
Dr. Hartmann deleted

49:21.726 --> 49:24.160
all the data in the DEC she used

49:24.162 --> 49:25.728
my superior neutron processor

49:25.730 --> 49:28.497
to carry out further
tests in secret.

49:28.499 --> 49:29.699
- But why?

49:29.701 --> 49:31.500
- [Alfred] To find
an antidote Miss Sue.

49:31.502 --> 49:33.202
If you would please take a look.

49:33.204 --> 49:34.303
(device whirring)

49:34.305 --> 49:36.105
- Okay Alfred, start recording.

49:36.107 --> 49:37.306
(tense music)

49:37.308 --> 49:40.443
I will now inject the NT26D.

49:40.445 --> 49:43.012
(tense music)

49:50.021 --> 49:51.053
(Maria sighs)

49:51.055 --> 49:52.288
Alfred, no reaction.

49:52.290 --> 49:55.057
The mutation is negative.

49:55.059 --> 49:56.776
(Maria sighs)

49:56.777 --> 49:58.494
Either I've made a mistake or,

50:00.732 --> 50:02.732
it's a genetic problem.

50:04.002 --> 50:06.002
(device whirring)

50:06.004 --> 50:06.769
- What does she mean?

50:06.771 --> 50:08.337
I don't get it.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.006
(device whirring)

50:10.008 --> 50:11.774
- [Alfred] Only you an
become invisible Miss Sue.

50:11.776 --> 50:14.777
The NT26 only reacts
with your blood.

50:14.779 --> 50:18.414
It has no effect on anyone else.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.349
- So what you're saying is Drill

50:20.351 --> 50:22.018
had my mother
kidnapped for nothing?

50:22.020 --> 50:24.153
- [Alfred] Dr. Drill
kidnapped your mother?

50:24.155 --> 50:25.755
- Sue, they're not
after you mother.

50:25.757 --> 50:27.056
They don't care about her.

50:27.058 --> 50:29.258
They really want you.

50:29.260 --> 50:31.060
- [Alfred] That is correct.

50:31.062 --> 50:33.462
If hypothetically
speaking someone plans

50:33.464 --> 50:38.100
to produce an invisibility
serum on the basis of NT26D,

50:38.102 --> 50:42.071
then they will need
Miss Sue's blood.

50:42.073 --> 50:46.108
In other words, you are
in great danger Miss Sue.

50:46.110 --> 50:51.147
(tense music)
(device whirring)

50:53.317 --> 50:58.354
(tense music)
(owl hooting)

50:59.457 --> 51:00.823
(Maria gasping)

51:00.825 --> 51:02.458
- [Maria] I've been kidnapped.

51:02.460 --> 51:06.662
Whoever finds this, protect
my daughter (groans).

51:06.664 --> 51:09.231
(eerie music)

51:20.278 --> 51:25.347
(owl hotting)
(pensive music)

51:33.624 --> 51:38.694
(knob rattling)
(eerie music)

51:41.099 --> 51:43.132
(door creaking)

51:43.134 --> 51:45.668
(tense music)

52:06.657 --> 52:09.125
(Tobi gasps)

52:12.563 --> 52:13.729
(Sue screams)

52:13.731 --> 52:18.501
(footsteps receding)
(dog barking)

52:24.876 --> 52:25.841
- Huh?

52:25.843 --> 52:28.911
(crickets chirping)

52:35.720 --> 52:38.554
(birds chirping)

52:40.258 --> 52:42.391
Sue, that was so cool.

52:42.393 --> 52:43.893
They thought I was you.

52:43.895 --> 52:47.463
I grabbed the first weapon
I found and then smack!

52:47.465 --> 52:52.535
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

52:55.373 --> 52:58.240
(device whirring)

53:00.645 --> 53:01.844
(Sue sighs)

53:01.846 --> 53:03.879
- I can't stop thinking
about that syringe.

53:03.881 --> 53:05.948
That was no coincidence.

53:07.218 --> 53:09.885
- They were looking for you.

53:09.887 --> 53:12.254
Lucky thing I slept
in Tobi's bed.

53:12.256 --> 53:14.523
(playful music)

53:14.525 --> 53:15.457
Ugh.

53:15.459 --> 53:16.926
Hey man, not what you think.

53:16.928 --> 53:20.362
I was tired and I
just fell asleep.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.364
- In Tobi's room.

53:22.366 --> 53:24.700
- Yeah, and he
went over to mine.

53:24.702 --> 53:25.601
- Ha!

53:25.603 --> 53:26.435
(Sue scoffs)

53:26.437 --> 53:27.269
- Stop it.

53:27.271 --> 53:28.671
(App giggles)

53:28.673 --> 53:29.838
- I've got something for you.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.474
(gentle music)

53:35.313 --> 53:37.746
(upbeat music)

53:40.318 --> 53:44.320
Fire proof material, extremely
light and indestructible.

53:44.322 --> 53:46.355
With a hood of course.

53:46.357 --> 53:47.590
(App sighs)

53:47.592 --> 53:49.358
This remote sends
hot and cold signals

53:49.360 --> 53:52.561
so you can control
your invisibility.

53:52.563 --> 53:56.532
This is fully packed
with my special mixture.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.667
To keep you awake you know?

53:58.669 --> 54:01.003
- App, you are such a genius.

54:01.005 --> 54:02.304
Thanks.

54:03.507 --> 54:06.942
- You could give me that
cool hoodie of yours.

54:06.944 --> 54:08.444
(plate clattering)

54:08.446 --> 54:09.945
- Thank you.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.614
(Tobi inhales)

54:11.616 --> 54:12.648
Delicious.

54:12.650 --> 54:14.984
(gentle music)

54:14.986 --> 54:17.319
- [App] Thank you Martha.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.322
(door latches)

54:20.324 --> 54:22.758
(gentle music)

54:22.760 --> 54:23.759
- Mm, where's Sue?

54:23.761 --> 54:28.731
(playful music)
(door creaking)

54:28.733 --> 54:31.734
Ha ha ha, so you're invisible?

54:31.736 --> 54:33.002
Time you thought
of something new.

54:33.004 --> 54:36.338
(playful music)

54:36.340 --> 54:37.306
That's not funny.

54:37.308 --> 54:38.574
They were my favorite.

54:38.576 --> 54:41.543
(triumphant music)

54:45.549 --> 54:46.682
- Did you order pancakes?

54:46.684 --> 54:47.883
- [Tobi] So cool.

54:47.885 --> 54:49.051
- [App] Invisible Sue.

54:49.053 --> 54:50.653
- Invisible Sue.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.325
- [Alfred] I commend you
on a great suit, Miss Sue.

54:56.327 --> 54:58.861
(playful music)

55:01.832 --> 55:06.902
(phone ringing)
(phone vibrating)

55:09.340 --> 55:10.406
- [Maria] Susanna?

55:10.408 --> 55:11.073
- Momma?

55:11.075 --> 55:12.841
- Susanna, finally.

55:12.843 --> 55:14.610
Oh, thank God it's you.

55:14.612 --> 55:16.512
(Maria sighs)

55:16.514 --> 55:19.648
Okay, I don't have much time.

55:19.650 --> 55:23.319
I managed to escape
but they're after me.

55:23.321 --> 55:24.987
You're in great danger.

55:24.989 --> 55:27.173
- Mom, where are you?

55:27.174 --> 55:29.358
- [Maria] We meet at the
old market in one hour.

55:29.360 --> 55:30.993
One hour, okay?

55:30.995 --> 55:32.027
At the fountain.

55:32.029 --> 55:33.896
Don't trust anyone.

55:33.898 --> 55:35.331
We (screams)...

55:35.333 --> 55:35.964
- Momma?

55:35.966 --> 55:37.333
(static crackling)

55:37.335 --> 55:37.966
Hello?

55:37.968 --> 55:40.703
(phone beeping)

55:42.606 --> 55:43.439
Damn it.

55:43.441 --> 55:46.375
(pensive music)

55:53.951 --> 55:55.384
- [Tobi] This is
not a good plan.

55:55.386 --> 55:58.787
We should've told
App's aunt about it.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.122
- She has no clue anyhow.

56:00.124 --> 56:02.024
She sleeps or reads all day.

56:02.026 --> 56:05.094
- Guys, can we
please concentrate.

56:05.096 --> 56:07.029
- Why would your mother
wanna meet us here?

56:07.031 --> 56:09.231
- Don't you get it?

56:09.232 --> 56:11.432
Drill won't kidnap Sue with so
many people looking on, yeah?

56:11.435 --> 56:12.868
- I wouldn't be so sure.

56:12.870 --> 56:17.106
(phone ringing)
(gentle music)

56:17.108 --> 56:18.291
- Yeah?

56:18.292 --> 56:19.475
- [Christopher]
Hey Invisible Sue,

56:19.477 --> 56:21.610
hope to see you soon (laughs).

56:21.612 --> 56:22.778
Aw, just a joke.

56:22.780 --> 56:24.012
I can't reach your mother,

56:24.014 --> 56:25.114
wanted to hear if
you were all right?

56:25.116 --> 56:26.148
- Uh, folks?

56:26.150 --> 56:27.283
We got company.

56:27.284 --> 56:28.417
- [Christopher] Uh,
I'm on my way home.

56:28.418 --> 56:29.551
I'll be there around eight.

56:29.553 --> 56:30.586
- Dad, this is
really bad timing.

56:30.588 --> 56:31.587
- [Christopher] Sue?

56:31.589 --> 56:33.021
- I'll call you back.
- Sue?

56:33.023 --> 56:35.157
- That is definitely
not your mother.

56:35.159 --> 56:36.458
- Will you shut up?

56:36.460 --> 56:37.659
Sue, what should we do?

56:37.661 --> 56:39.528
(tense music)

56:39.530 --> 56:40.496
Sue?

56:40.498 --> 56:44.500
(Sue gasps)
(gentle music)

56:44.502 --> 56:45.801
(App laughs)

56:45.803 --> 56:47.403
- Oh my God.

56:47.405 --> 56:50.572
(gentle music)

56:50.574 --> 56:51.473
- Sorry.

56:53.077 --> 56:54.877
- [Alfred] Miss Sue, may
I draw your attention

56:54.879 --> 56:58.046
to the fact that your blood
pressure is remarkably high.

56:58.048 --> 57:00.082
- Alfred, get off
the line right now.

57:00.084 --> 57:01.450
- [Alfred] As you wish.

57:01.452 --> 57:02.151
(device whirring)

57:02.153 --> 57:04.887
(pensive music)

57:06.190 --> 57:07.489
- [App] Shit!

57:07.491 --> 57:08.424
- [Man] Two men this way.

57:08.426 --> 57:09.892
Two men stay at the car.

57:09.894 --> 57:11.794
(man speaking in
foreign language)

57:11.796 --> 57:12.795
- There they are!

57:12.797 --> 57:17.699
(dramatic music)
(drone whirring)

57:18.536 --> 57:19.735
What are you waiting for?

57:19.737 --> 57:21.003
It's just a toy drone.

57:21.005 --> 57:23.539
(drone zapping)
(men groaning)

57:23.541 --> 57:28.610
(drone whirring)
(dramatic music)

57:29.213 --> 57:33.882
(church bell tolling)
(gentle music)

57:33.884 --> 57:34.716
- [Maria] Great move.

57:34.718 --> 57:35.717
Now they'll trust us.

57:35.719 --> 57:37.553
- Why are you here?

57:37.555 --> 57:38.187
- Jonas, damn it.

57:38.189 --> 57:39.588
She's my daughter.

57:39.590 --> 57:41.523
- You should've let
me know earlier.

57:41.525 --> 57:46.595
(church bell tolling)
(tense music)

57:48.098 --> 57:50.999
(engine rumbling)

57:52.536 --> 57:53.869
(device whirring)

57:53.871 --> 57:55.471
- [Alfred] Miss Sue, I
retraced your mother's

57:55.473 --> 57:57.139
most recent call
and sent her last

57:57.141 --> 57:59.808
known position to
App's pocket computer.

57:59.810 --> 58:00.976
- Maybe she's still
there and that's

58:00.978 --> 58:03.579
why she didn't make it here.

58:05.683 --> 58:07.649
Jeez, it's in the
middle of nowhere.

58:07.651 --> 58:09.251
- It's most likely another trap.

58:09.253 --> 58:10.853
Already forgot
what just happened?

58:10.855 --> 58:12.721
Your mother lured
us into a trap.

58:12.723 --> 58:13.622
- My mother?

58:13.624 --> 58:14.256
Are you nuts?

58:14.258 --> 58:17.526
(cellphone ringing)

58:19.597 --> 58:21.530
- Hey Tobi, what's up?

58:21.532 --> 58:23.065
Coming to the Halloween party?

58:23.067 --> 58:23.899
I think you should.

58:23.901 --> 58:26.502
It'd be really great.

58:26.504 --> 58:27.135
Bye!

58:27.137 --> 58:29.838
(girls giggling)

58:29.840 --> 58:30.706
(phone beeps)

58:30.708 --> 58:31.640
- No can do.

58:31.642 --> 58:33.108
He's got better things to do.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.677
(phone beeps)

58:37.681 --> 58:38.514
(phone thuds)

58:38.516 --> 58:39.715
- [Tobi] Are you crazy?

58:39.717 --> 58:41.216
- So they can't
track our position.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.551
- It was brand new.

58:42.553 --> 58:43.285
- Don't cry.

58:43.287 --> 58:45.621
It was a crappy phone anyway.

58:45.623 --> 58:48.257
(engine rumbling)

58:48.259 --> 58:50.559
- Hey, what about this van?
- Oh great.

58:50.561 --> 58:51.544
- [Man] I'll meet you

58:51.545 --> 58:52.528
under the bridge.
- Now what?

58:52.530 --> 58:53.295
- [Man] We gotta
find these kids.

58:53.297 --> 58:54.563
Come on.

58:54.565 --> 58:55.797
(man speaking faintly)

58:55.799 --> 58:56.865
- [Tobi] I have an idea.

58:56.867 --> 58:57.733
Come on, let's go.

58:57.735 --> 59:00.702
(dramatic music)

59:00.704 --> 59:02.170
- [App] Are you serious?

59:02.172 --> 59:03.639
- You got a better idea?

59:03.641 --> 59:06.074
(dramatic music)

59:06.076 --> 59:06.942
Hurry, hurry.

59:06.944 --> 59:09.545
(dramatic music)

59:09.547 --> 59:12.648
(engine rumbling)

59:14.151 --> 59:15.551
- Hey, that's mine!

59:15.553 --> 59:18.086
(playful music)

59:19.623 --> 59:21.290
- In which direction
did they go?

59:21.292 --> 59:22.591
- What?

59:23.327 --> 59:25.594
- Which direction?

59:25.596 --> 59:30.666
(dramatic music)
(engine rumbling)

59:41.045 --> 59:43.278
- They're right behind us.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.314
Watch out Tobi.

59:45.316 --> 59:46.848
(dramatic music)

59:46.850 --> 59:48.817
- Make sure do they
do not get injured.

59:48.819 --> 59:50.586
- [Sure] Whoa.

59:50.588 --> 59:51.787
What are you doing?

59:51.789 --> 59:53.288
- [Tobi] Old super hero trick.

59:53.290 --> 59:54.623
Ever watch E.T.?

59:54.625 --> 59:55.657
- What?

59:55.659 --> 59:56.592
E.T.?

59:56.594 --> 59:57.626
- [Tobi] Give me the flux thing,

59:57.628 --> 59:59.628
and Sue make us invisible.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.863
(engine rumbling)

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:03.632
- Why aren't they slowing down?

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:06.168
- Maybe they think they
can drive right through us.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.337
(device whirring)
(dramatic music)

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:09.204
- [Tobi] Hold on tight.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:12.040
(dramatic music)

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:16.712
Woo hoo!

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:19.281
(Sue screams)

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:25.887
(all yelling)
(dramatic music)

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:32.294
(pizzas splattering)

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:37.733
- Woo hoo (laughs)!

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:40.402
(engine rumbling)

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:51.313
That was totally awesome!

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:52.280
Tobi!

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:54.650
- [Tobi] Thanks.

01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.685
- Alfred, is this
the right place?

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:57.953
- [Alfred] Correct.

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.756
This is the last known
location of your mother.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:03.859
- [Tobi] Sue, I don't
like this at all.

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:07.929
- [Sue] Alfred, can
you locate my mother?

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.666
- [Alfred] That
exceeds my abilities.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:11.366
- [Tobi] Wow, what a miracle.

01:01:11.368 --> 01:01:12.801
Something it can't do.

01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:15.303
- [Alfred] I will ignore
this outrageousness

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.339
and shut down for now.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.374
- Sue, if your mother really
escaped, where is she now?

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:21.393
Why doesn't she call?

01:01:21.394 --> 01:01:23.411
- Because I dumped
our cellphones dummy.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.981
- This is a trap just
like at the plaza.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:28.684
First they lure us here and
then wham and your mother?

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.152
- What?

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:33.722
- Is involved somehow just
like this holographic machine.

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:35.057
- Are you crazy?

01:01:35.059 --> 01:01:37.259
You think my mother
and Drill planned this?

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:38.694
She would never do this.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.829
- I haven no idea but
we really need to leave.

01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:43.965
- If you're so scared why don't
you go back to your mommy?

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.734
You're not even helping.

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:47.903
So why don't you go back to
that stupid Halloween party

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.338
with your cute little Eileen?

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:52.207
- [App] Sue.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:56.411
(Tobi sighs)

01:01:58.882 --> 01:01:59.848
- What?

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.850
You want me to apologize now?

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:04.753
(engine rumbling)

01:02:14.798 --> 01:02:16.031
- And they say I'm the one who

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:18.033
can't get along
with other people?

01:02:18.035 --> 01:02:19.935
(engine rumbling)

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:22.504
(tense music)

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:27.843
That thing doesn't
look very friendly.

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:29.411
Make us invisible, quickly Sue!

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:30.846
- [Robotic Voice] Stand now.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.314
- [Sue] I can't.

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.749
I guess it got damaged
when we were on the bike.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:34.950
- [Robotic Voice]
Computer's located.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:37.419
Remain where you are.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:38.386
Intruders located

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:40.355
in the warehouse sector.
- Run!

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:41.523
- [Robotic Voice]
Stay where you are.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:42.758
Stay on the ground.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.059
Show your hands.

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:47.095
Intruders located in
the warehouse sector.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:52.167
(tense music)
(dog barking)

01:02:58.509 --> 01:02:59.541
- Oh my God.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:02.544
(door latches)

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:03.912
Sue?

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:07.182
(tense music)
(footsteps receding)

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:08.350
Sue?

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.184
Oh no.

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:11.186
No, no, no, no, no.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:12.087
Oh!

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:14.456
Maria?

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:18.293
(objects clattering)

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.427
Who the hell are you?

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.562
What are you doing in my house?

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:25.834
(tense music)
(footsteps approaching)

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:31.439
(eerie music)
(wind whistling)

01:03:49.226 --> 01:03:50.859
- Did we lose them?

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.062
(dramatic music)

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:54.896
- [Man] Stand down.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:57.265
Stay where you are.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:58.466
Do not move.

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.435
(dog barking)

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:02.003
Come out with your hands up.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:04.072
- [Alfred] Miss Sue,
I realize your plan

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:05.874
and strongly advise against it.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:07.943
- This will distract
them and run.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.244
We'll meet on the
other side of the hall.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.947
- [Alfred] NT26D is
highly explosive Miss Sue.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.014
- Alfred, not now.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.116
On three.
- Sue, wait.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:15.951
- One.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:16.918
- Why do I even talk?

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.887
- Two, three.

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:21.223
Here, have fun with this!

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:24.292
(explosion booming)

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:27.996
(dramatic music)

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.567
(eerie music)

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:43.545
Momma?

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:47.649
- It's an original edition.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:48.950
Very rare.

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:51.453
- [Sue] How did I get here?

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:52.888
What happened?

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:56.524
- You passed out in school but

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:59.427
the doctor couldn't
find anything.

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:03.965
He gave you an injection
to stop the pain.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:09.938
Yes, the heating was off
but it won't take long now.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.107
- But you were kidnapped.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.310
Drill, I don't understand.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.915
- Sounds like a
really exciting dream.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.116
- It was no dream.

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:23.285
Mom, I can make myself...

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:26.688
We need to go to App right now.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:27.522
- [Maria] Why?

01:05:27.524 --> 01:05:28.456
Where is Kaya?

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:29.925
- Wait, how do you know her?

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:32.360
- Come on Susanna,
I know your friends.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:36.598
- She ran into the hall
after the explosion,

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.999
when the flood lights were--

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.668
- You know how absurd
this sounds, right?

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.469
I'm sure she's fine.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:46.541
We'll call her first thing
in the morning, all right?

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:49.444
(footsteps receding)

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:53.581
Oh, before I forget a boy
called for you earlier.

01:05:53.583 --> 01:05:54.416
- Tobi?

01:05:54.418 --> 01:05:55.483
- [Maria] Yes, Tobi.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:58.453
- Because of the
Halloween party?

01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.688
- Halloween party?

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:00.722
- In the town pool.

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:03.358
He wanted to meet Eileen there.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:05.994
- Eileen?

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:08.697
I'm sure he'll call again.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:09.731
Love you darling.

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:11.599
(door creaks)

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.969
(door latches)

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.437
(footsteps receding)

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:18.073
(gentle music)

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:41.062
(hand bangs)

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:41.763
- Mom?

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:43.631
(hand bangs)

01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:45.633
Mom, what's up with the door?

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:47.035
(Sue sighs)

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.570
(Sue scoffs)

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:51.106
(objects clattering)

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.173
What's going on?

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:57.245
(gentle music)
(objects clattering)

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:00.315
Mom?

01:07:00.317 --> 01:07:01.783
(hand banging)

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:03.018
Mom!

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.753
(hands banging)

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:06.354
Momma!

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.757
(Sue groans)

01:07:08.759 --> 01:07:11.059
(Sue panting)
(gentle music)

01:07:11.061 --> 01:07:13.228
Momma.

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.396
(gentle music)
(footsteps approaching)

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:17.098
- Keep a close eye on her.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.767
She has to be kept cooled
and no outside contact,

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.068
understood?
- Understand.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.102
- [Man] Copy that.

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:21.803
Let's go.

01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:24.305
- [Man] Right through.

01:07:24.307 --> 01:07:25.373
- [Man] Yeah, go 'head.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:26.641
- It's me.

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:27.475
All done.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:28.643
I've got the girl.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.378
Kaya's at the old steel
mill and the boy's

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.347
at a party at a town pool.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:34.382
I'll take care of him,
you go get the girl.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.518
- [Man] Okay, I'll take my
men to the party at the pool

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.120
and we'll meet there and
we'll get the boy first.

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:41.589
I sure hope you took
the girl's blood.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.491
Boss is gonna want it.

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:48.596
(tense music)

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:50.565
(neck cracking)

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:53.134
(tense music)

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:13.121
(Sue sobbing)
(gentle music)

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:16.157
- [Alfred] Miss Sue,
please do not cry.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.759
Let me show you something.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.395
(gentle music)

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.140
- Run she said, to the other
side of the hall she said.

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:33.174
Great.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.742
This place is gigantic.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.779
(App gasps)

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:38.613
Shit.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:41.515
(engine rumbling)

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.124
(door unlatches)

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.225
- Sue?

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:52.460
Where is Sue?

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:56.264
- Mrs. Hartmann?

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.332
What are you doing here?

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:00.667
- And who are you?

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:07.375
(men grunting)
(taser crackling)

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.209
- [Sue] Hello?

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:09.444
(hand banging)

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:11.212
- [Maria] Susanna?

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:20.220
- App, get away from my mother.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:24.425
- What are you talking about?

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:25.827
- [Sue] Open it.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:29.197
Come on (gasping).

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.698
- [Alfred] Dr. Hartmann,
what indescribable joy

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:32.834
to see you again.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:33.734
- Momma!

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:37.205
(Maria laughs)

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.540
- [Maria] Now can you tell
me what's going on here?

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.910
- Only the real Maria
can open the pendent.

01:09:41.912 --> 01:09:43.611
- The real Maria?

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.548
- Look, let me
show you something.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:49.450
(device whirring)

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:55.290
- I've always dream of
being a super hero Susanna.

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:58.927
A few days ago in the lab
when you showed me that world,

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:04.199
that feeling of power
(laughs), my dream returned.

01:10:04.935 --> 01:10:05.833
Thank you.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:10.405
If I'd known that all
I need is your blood.

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:12.974
(eerie music)

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:18.846
(Lenia groaning)
(tense music)

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.704
(device whirring)

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:45.940
- NT26D is harmless for
most people and mixed

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:49.644
with my blood it mutates
and becomes a super serum.

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:52.413
- Mutating differently with
each person as I suspected.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.581
- Exactly.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.650
Each body reacts
differently to my blood.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:58.186
I become invisible.

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.721
Lenia can change her shape
and Kaya could maybe even fly.

01:11:00.724 --> 01:11:01.589
- Fly?

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.325
- Where did Lenia go?

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:06.894
(tense music)

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:11.299
- She asked me about Tobi and
I told her about the party.

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.600
Oh no!

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.703
- She's getting rid
of all the witnesses.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:18.306
First Sue, then Tobi and me.

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:23.444
(tense music)

01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:28.349
- Hi Tobi, I thought
you were too busy.

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:29.317
I thought you had other plans?

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.018
- [Tobi] Plans change.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.919
(Eileen giggles)

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:32.754
- Wish me luck.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:35.490
(girl chuckles)

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.993
¶ Come along ¶

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:40.979
¶ We don't care who you are ¶

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.964
- [DJ Goblin] Are you gonna
freak out with your face?

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:45.366
The one, the only DJ Goblin!

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:49.304
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:51.606
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:55.877
- Mr. Goblin, would you
please turn it down a bit?

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:56.744
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.012
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:11:58.014 --> 01:11:58.846
- I've been told we
need to turn it down.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.081
What do you guys think?

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:02.350
(crowd cheering)

01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:03.751
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:05.386
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.688
(engine rumbling)

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.424
- How exactly did you find Kaya?

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:11.559
- [Kaya] Your sweater's chipped.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:13.428
Does she know that?

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:14.062
- No.

01:12:14.064 --> 01:12:15.797
- Yeah.

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:17.832
- I was really
surprised to find App

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.935
and not you in that sweater.

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:23.371
- And how did you find me?

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:26.341
- [Maria] Your socks.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:27.342
- What?

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.409
- Also chipped.

01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:29.911
- Mom!

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.413
- [Maria] I'm sorry, I'll
stop doing it I promise.

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:33.815
(device whirring)

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:36.451
(App exhaling)

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.618
- Miss Hartmann?

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.054
How did you get away from Lenia?

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.023
- She was so busy
searching for Sue

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:44.425
and completely forgot about me,

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:46.694
and I was able to escape.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.430
I ran for my life with
the others after me.

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:51.366
I tried to hide
in that hall when

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:54.435
the ceiling suddenly collapsed.

01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:57.505
Didn't think your old
mom could do that, huh?

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.741
- Not in my dreams.

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:00.908
- I must've fainted.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.143
I can't remember a thing

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:05.646
until Jonas found me
buried in the debris.

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:06.547
- Jonas?

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.083
Jonas Drill?

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:11.152
- Yes.

01:13:11.154 --> 01:13:12.687
He's been helping me.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:14.789
- So why didn't he just say so?

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:18.993
We thought that he was
chasing us all along.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.763
- Jonas is the most
loyal person I know.

01:13:21.765 --> 01:13:22.597
(device beeps)

01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:23.931
- Here.

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:25.400
I repaired the remote.

01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:27.502
- [Maria] And look
under the seat.

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:29.971
I've got something for you too.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:34.509
(liquid sloshing)

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:35.476
It's the antidote.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:36.878
A promise is a promise.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.780
- An antidote?

01:13:38.782 --> 01:13:40.081
What for?

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:41.916
- Are you kidding?

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:44.185
To stop you from
turning invisible again.

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:45.553
- But I don't need it.

01:13:45.555 --> 01:13:47.188
I don't need an antidote Mom.

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:49.724
I'm Invisible Sue now.

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:51.125
(lid slams)

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.160
¶ Everybody ¶

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:53.461
¶ On the floor ¶

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:54.762
¶ Get moving on the floor ¶

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.431
¶ Now everybody ¶

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:57.665
¶ Everybody ¶

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:58.566
¶ Get standin' up ¶

01:13:58.568 --> 01:13:59.634
¶ Now move ¶

01:13:59.636 --> 01:14:00.435
- Hi.
- More punch please.

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:02.170
- [Bartender] Comin' up.

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:03.070
- Hi.

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:06.441
I uh, nice music.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.708
Do you feel like dancing?

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.478
- Um, I don't really
know how to dance.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.179
- I do.

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:12.213
Come on.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.982
¶ What you wanna be ¶

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.750
¶ 'Cause that's
the way we roll ¶

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:18.653
(engine rumbling)

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:23.458
¶ That's the way roll ¶

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.026
- [Maria] So, here we go.

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:28.563
You save Tobi and I'll
get Drill and his men.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:31.165
¶ That's the way we are ¶

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:32.166
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:14:32.168 --> 01:14:33.000
¶ Uh huh ¶

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:36.637
¶ Crazy the way we are ¶

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:40.541
(footsteps approaching)

01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:41.242
- So what's the plan?

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:42.944
- To recuse Tobi.

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:44.812
- Are you sure you wanna
do that with the antidote?

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.147
- No, listen.

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:47.615
We go in, find Lenia.

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:49.183
Now matter how she
looks now we try

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:51.519
to distract her until
I can get close.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:52.887
Then I'll inject her with this

01:14:52.889 --> 01:14:55.022
and hope it works
with Lenia as well.

01:14:55.024 --> 01:14:57.058
- [Alfred] May I add
that your mother said

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.560
nothing about the
antidote and Miss Lenia.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:00.661
- That's correct.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.763
However, I changed the plan.

01:15:02.765 --> 01:15:05.600
(upbeat music)

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:11.772
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:13.808
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.009
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.178
¶ Yeah you know
that's how we livin' ¶

01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:22.250
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:25.853
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.021
¶ Let's go ¶

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:27.922
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:29.056
¶ Let's go ¶

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:29.891
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:31.092
¶ Let's go ¶

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:32.026
¶ Come on ¶

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.628
- [Sue] This can't be true.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.597
- [Alfred] Miss Sue, if
you permit me to say,

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:40.635
there are plenty
of fish in the sea.

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:41.802
- I don't have a crush.

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:43.638
- [App] No, of course you don't.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.939
- [Alfred] No one claimed that.

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:46.807
- All of a sudden you two agree?

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:50.044
- Okay, you don't have a crush.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.679
- No I don't.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:52.980
Let's get going.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:53.814
- I'll look for Lenia.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:56.651
(upbeat music)

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:58.553
¶ Let's go ¶

01:15:58.555 --> 01:15:59.186
¶ Let's go ¶

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:00.021
¶ Let's ¶

01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:00.788
¶ Let's ¶

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:01.622
¶ Let's go ¶

01:16:01.624 --> 01:16:05.059
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:09.096
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:10.565
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:11.198
¶ Let's go ¶

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.033
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:12.967
¶ Let's go ¶

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:13.801
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:14.735
¶ Let's go ¶

01:16:14.737 --> 01:16:15.736
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:16.871
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:19.106
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:19.943 --> 01:16:22.743
- Excuse me, Mr. Goblin?

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:23.678
- What?

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.845
Do you wanna request a song?

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:26.247
- Yeah, exactly.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.649
Here, on my phone please.

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:29.850
- Is this a smartphone?

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:30.785
- [App] Yeah.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:32.320
Just push the yellow button.

01:16:32.322 --> 01:16:34.989
(Mr. Goblin groaning)
(electricity crackling)

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:35.823
Idiot.

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:38.759
(upbeat music)

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:42.096
Sue, I'm in position.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.265
How's it goin' down there?

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.333
- [Sue] I don't know.

01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:46.767
Anyone could be Lenia.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:48.135
How am I gonna recognize her?

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:49.270
¶ Let's go ¶

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.706
¶ Come on ¶

01:16:53.176 --> 01:16:54.141
- Hi.

01:16:54.143 --> 01:16:55.643
- Hi.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:56.944
Are you lost?

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.379
What do you want?

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:00.648
- I just wanna know
what's going on with you.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.383
- Yeah, good I guess.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:05.620
¶ We had just enough ¶

01:17:05.622 --> 01:17:06.654
Oh.

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:07.722
That, yes.

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:08.356
Cool.

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:09.223
- And?

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.691
Did you two already?

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:12.510
- No, we haven't.

01:17:12.511 --> 01:17:14.328
And actually why should
I tell you anything?

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.865
¶ Lovely you are ¶

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.167
(groaning)

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:30.411
(upbeat music)
(kids cheering)

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:35.216
¶ Oo oo oo oo oo oo ¶

01:17:35.218 --> 01:17:37.752
- What's wrong with you?

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.938
- Eileen.

01:17:39.939 --> 01:17:42.123
She acts like she
doesn't even know me.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:46.861
She's like so mean and nasty.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:48.896
- Sounds just like Eileen.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.798
- No, it's not Eileen.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:53.768
¶ We were flyin' free ¶

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:55.403
¶ Virtual reality ¶

01:17:55.405 --> 01:17:57.371
¶ We crash kicked the ground ¶

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:59.440
¶ This burn is on
this silver town ¶

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:03.044
¶ 10,000 miles away
headin' for the cave ¶

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:05.346
¶ You had had had to go ¶

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:06.947
¶ And we were happy go lucky ¶

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:08.249
- Hey everyone?

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.951
Eileen is Lenia.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:11.886
You understand?

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:12.753
- This keeps gettin' better.

01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:13.988
- Momma?

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.356
Momma, can you hear me?

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:17.575
Where are you?

01:18:17.576 --> 01:18:19.793
Mom, we could really
use your help here.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.698
¶ When we were happy
go and lucky go ¶

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.732
¶ Lucky ¶

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:25.466
¶ Lucky ¶

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:26.801
- [App] Lenia's men are here.

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.035
They're going after Tobi.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.071
(upbeat music)

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:33.908
¶ We could never go back again ¶

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.376
¶ I see you ¶

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.778
I've locked the doors but
that won't stop them for long.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.979
- [Sue] We can't wait.

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:40.781
Bet he will have
his own dance floor.

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:42.349
(upbeat music)

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:43.784
Can you see her?

01:18:43.786 --> 01:18:45.720
- Yeah, I see her.

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:47.488
- [Sue] I'll try my
best to get Tobi.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:51.058
I need fog, lots of
fog to confuse Lenia.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.793
Give it all you got.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:54.862
- [App] Oh.

01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:57.765
(upbeat music)
(kids cheering)

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:58.899
- [Tobi] What's going on?

01:18:58.901 --> 01:18:59.767
Sue?

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:01.302
- [Sue] Tobi, hurry.

01:19:01.304 --> 01:19:02.136
Come with me.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:02.970
- Leave me alone.

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:03.804
What do you want?

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:04.805
- We need to leave.

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:06.874
Eileen is not Eileen.

01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:07.942
She's Lenia.

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:10.511
She took my blood.

01:19:10.513 --> 01:19:11.946
Please trust me.

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:14.048
- Why should I believe
a word you say?

01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:16.917
(upbeat music)

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:22.790
(neck cracking)
(upbeat music)

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:29.997
- Tobi please!

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:31.532
I'm sorry for what
I said to you.

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:35.002
I was angry and I didn't
know who to trust anymore.

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:36.937
It was a huge mistake.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:38.305
I need you.

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:39.974
We can't do it without you.

01:19:39.976 --> 01:19:41.842
- Oh, look at you two.

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:43.778
How sweet, but this time there

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.546
will be no happily ever after.
- Hey, no!

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:47.882
- Let go of him you evil hag.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.383
- Or what?

01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:51.051
You'll become invisible?

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:52.887
Oh, I'm so afraid Hartmann!

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:54.421
Do you see what I can do?

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:56.423
I'm way more powerful than you.

01:19:56.425 --> 01:19:58.959
(eerie music)

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:02.897
(crowd gasps)
(upbeat music)

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:03.798
- Susanna?

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.135
- [App] Sue, Lenia's men
just broke through the doors.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:09.170
They're everywhere.

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:10.204
- [Man] Keep right!

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.539
- It's now or never.

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:12.473
- [Sue] Hey Lenia?

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:13.908
You think you have power?

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:16.577
You need more than that
to be a super hero.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:17.878
Tobi, now!

01:20:18.948 --> 01:20:20.581
(Lenia screams)

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.916
- Sue, now!

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:23.450
(Lenia groans)

01:20:23.452 --> 01:20:24.285
- Game over.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:27.588
(Lenia groans)

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:28.422
- Sue!

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:31.258
(dramatic music)

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:35.129
(kids chattering)

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:44.839
- [Man] Clear, the left.

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:49.043
- And that was the
show Invisible Sue

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:51.612
and her mysterious
sidekick Tobi.

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:54.381
(crowd cheering)

01:20:56.586 --> 01:20:58.619
(knocking)

01:20:58.621 --> 01:20:59.987
- [Eileen] Hello?

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:00.988
Help!

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:02.857
Hello!

01:21:02.859 --> 01:21:03.891
Help!

01:21:03.893 --> 01:21:04.558
Anyone there?

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.593
- Eileen?

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:06.627
- [Eileen] Miss Gunnarsson,
I'm in the bathroom.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:07.528
It's me, Eileen.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.531
(triumphant music)

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:16.136
(App gasping)

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.005
(App laughs)

01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:21.008
(triumphant music)

01:21:39.262 --> 01:21:41.128
- Kaya, darling?

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.598
Your mother asked me
to come pick you up.

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:47.501
Who's that?

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:51.572
- Um, that's our
uh, music teacher.

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:54.608
(App's tongue clicks)

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:56.076
- Drank too much.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:01.315
- Okay then, maybe we should
take her to the hospital.

01:22:01.317 --> 01:22:04.051
(cart rattling)

01:22:05.655 --> 01:22:07.488
- Check out the wheel
of her wheelchair.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:08.322
Look familiar?

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:10.691
(tense music)

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:13.027
- Like on the
video from the lab.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:14.261
(tense music)

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.696
- Are you okay?

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:17.598
Do you need help?

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.434
- Um, we forgot something
back at the swimming pool?

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.269
(Sue groaning)

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.938
- [Kaya's Aunt] Was
she drinking too?

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.606
- Uh, no, no.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.374
Allergic reaction.

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:32.446
(engine revving)
(dramatic music)

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:42.723
- [Alfred] Miss Sue, I just
placed an emergency call.

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:44.191
You should run.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:47.127
The water's destroyed my system.

01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:50.998
- [Maria] Sue!

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:51.665
- Mom?

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.000
- [Maria] Sue.

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:54.001
- Mom.

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:55.369
- [Tobi] Sue, no, no.

01:22:55.371 --> 01:22:56.603
Come on, come on.

01:22:56.605 --> 01:22:57.571
- [Sue] Mom!

01:22:57.573 --> 01:22:59.974
- I'm tired of playing games.

01:22:59.976 --> 01:23:02.676
You must be wondering
what's going on.

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:05.512
Yes, I ordered
Lenia to keep an eye

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:09.750
on your mother in order
to get her hands on NT26D.

01:23:11.053 --> 01:23:12.720
I also had your mother
kidnapped when it was clear

01:23:12.722 --> 01:23:16.023
that the serum had this
wonderful side effect.

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:17.057
- [Maria] Sue!

01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:18.158
- There.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:21.762
Now that we've
explained all that,

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:25.566
I'd be very happy if you'd
all just get into the car.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:26.533
Understood?

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:29.169
Now.

01:23:31.474 --> 01:23:33.407
- Uh, but why?

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:35.376
- Darling, you think Drill can

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:38.278
do all that but
not me, a cripple?

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:42.082
Profit and healing.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.119
That's a great combination.

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:47.688
(tense music)

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:52.059
- Get the children.

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:53.027
Secure them.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:54.628
- [Man] Block all the exits,

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.630
and get this thing out of here.

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:57.464
- I just said!

01:23:57.466 --> 01:23:58.332
- [Sue] No!

01:23:58.334 --> 01:23:59.366
- Let me go!

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.100
Sue!
- Okay, enough now.

01:24:00.102 --> 01:24:01.101
- Sue!

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:01.735
- Get in.

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:02.669
- We're going nowhere.

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:05.172
The NT26D has been destroyed.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:10.511
- My dear child,
you're smart enough

01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:13.480
to know not all
NT26D was destroyed.

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:16.050
(tense music)

01:24:17.319 --> 01:24:19.053
Exactly.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:21.822
It's running through your veins.

01:24:21.824 --> 01:24:25.059
My backup insurance
plan, your blood.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:27.428
(tense music)

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:36.070
- You let my parents
and my friends

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:38.138
go right now or
you'll regret it.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.807
(tense music)

01:24:39.809 --> 01:24:42.810
- You're braver and
smarter then I thought.

01:24:42.812 --> 01:24:48.115
But you should think about
your next steps very carefully.

01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:51.085
If you inject that antidote,

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:53.353
you won't be Invisible
Sue any longer.

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:54.788
- No Sue, don't do it!

01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:58.525
- All of your super
hero powers will vanish.

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:05.132
And you will just be this
little unremarkable Susanna.

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:11.271
(dramatic music)

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:19.246
(Sue groans)

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:24.318
(dramatic music)
(Sue gasping)

01:25:26.889 --> 01:25:29.556
That was a big mistake child.

01:25:30.726 --> 01:25:32.226
- Yeah, it was.

01:25:35.164 --> 01:25:35.863
Old bag.

01:25:36.866 --> 01:25:37.898
(Sue groans)

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.166
(dramatic music)

01:25:39.168 --> 01:25:40.200
- Hey, hey!

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:40.901
Hey!

01:25:41.904 --> 01:25:44.538
Guard, I'm going backwards!

01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:45.539
(wheelchair clattering)

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:49.243
(siren wailing)
(dramatic music)

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:49.877
- Sue!

01:25:49.879 --> 01:25:50.878
- Invisible Sue okay?

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.613
(sirens wailing)
(dramatic music)

01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:53.514
- Kaya!

01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:55.883
I called the police!

01:25:55.885 --> 01:25:59.186
(dramatic music)

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:00.754
- Sue, sue?

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:02.389
Sue.

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:03.624
- [Maria] Are you okay?

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:04.625
- [Christopher] Sue?

01:26:04.627 --> 01:26:05.893
- Oh Kaya.

01:26:05.895 --> 01:26:11.165
(dramatic music)
(all speaking faintly)

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:24.545
- Sue, sue?

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:25.379
- Sue?

01:26:25.381 --> 01:26:26.213
- Sue?

01:26:26.215 --> 01:26:27.247
What's wrong?

01:26:27.249 --> 01:26:27.881
- [Tobi] Sue?

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:29.249
- [Kaya] Sue?

01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:31.969
- [Christopher] We
need an ambulance fast!

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.688
(all speaking faintly)
(tense music)

01:26:39.228 --> 01:26:42.496
(birds chirping)

01:26:42.498 --> 01:26:43.497
- [Sue] Dad?

01:26:43.499 --> 01:26:44.798
- Good morning.

01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:46.800
Hm.

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:48.235
Uh, drink this.

01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:50.837
(birds chirping)

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.483
- What happened?

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:06.620
- You fell down the
stairs at school.

01:27:06.622 --> 01:27:09.756
- It was some scene, everyone
running around crazy.

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:13.827
We brought you over to
your friend Kaya's house.

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.797
- You're lying.

01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:19.633
- Just stretchin' the truth.

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:21.301
- Don't let him mess with you.

01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:24.004
Your dad's making
up stories again.

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:26.540
- Dad, come on that's not funny.

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:31.311
- As soon as you're strong
enough, we want all the details.

01:27:31.313 --> 01:27:32.713
Every single one.

01:27:32.715 --> 01:27:33.547
- Really?

01:27:33.549 --> 01:27:34.381
Everything?

01:27:34.383 --> 01:27:35.849
- Yes, all of it.

01:27:36.719 --> 01:27:39.620
(phone vibrating)

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:41.655
- The police?

01:27:41.657 --> 01:27:44.458
They probably want the
whole truth as well.

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.494
(phone vibrating)

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:48.729
Hello, this is Christopher.

01:27:48.731 --> 01:27:51.331
(footsteps receding)

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:52.032
- [Sue] Mom?

01:27:52.034 --> 01:27:53.333
- Hm?

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:57.871
- Lenia was right.

01:27:57.873 --> 01:27:59.706
I've lost everything.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.609
- [Alfred] If you
will permit me,

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.778
you have not lost anything.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.697
- Alfred?

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.615
- [Alfred] Miss Sue, we are
incredibly proud of you.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:09.449
(Maria chuckles)

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:10.884
- App fixed it for you.

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:13.020
(Sue sighs)

01:28:13.022 --> 01:28:14.321
It's yours now.

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:19.526
(gentle music)

01:28:22.564 --> 01:28:24.364
- [Sue] Mom?

01:28:24.366 --> 01:28:26.500
You can open your present now.

01:28:26.502 --> 01:28:29.369
(gentle music)

01:28:35.044 --> 01:28:35.876
- Oh.

01:28:35.878 --> 01:28:38.512
(gentle music)

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:45.552
Thank you, Sue.

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:48.388
(gentle music)

01:28:51.393 --> 01:28:52.459
- [Sue] Alfred is right.

01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:54.861
I haven't lost anything.

01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:57.664
Maybe I'm not
Invisible Sue anymore,

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:00.100
but I am Sue Hartmann.

01:29:00.102 --> 01:29:04.104
I have the coolest parents,
an ingenious holograph Alfred,

01:29:04.106 --> 01:29:06.640
and App and Tobi too of course.

01:29:06.642 --> 01:29:08.508
The best friends in the world.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.378
(gentle music)

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.490
(siren wailing)
(gentle music)

01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:27.461
- So, I just got an
incredibly long message

01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:28.795
from Eileen in my voicemail.

01:29:28.797 --> 01:29:29.730
- You too?

01:29:29.732 --> 01:29:30.964
My voicemail is full

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:34.101
of hysterical stories
about her doppelganger.

01:29:34.103 --> 01:29:36.403
(Kaya laughs)
(Tobi laughs)

01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:39.106
- I actually feel sorry for her.

01:29:39.108 --> 01:29:42.509
Because of all of her
lying and bullying,

01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:43.710
everyone thinks she invented

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.113
all those stories
just to get attention.

01:29:46.115 --> 01:29:47.848
Nobody believes her.

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:50.150
This time for once,
she's telling the truth.

01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:52.786
(gentle music)

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:03.130
(siren wailing)
(gentle music)

01:30:10.005 --> 01:30:10.837
(Sue gags)

01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:11.938
(Sue vomits)

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.773
- Ugh!

01:30:12.775 --> 01:30:14.107
- Disgusting!

01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:16.176
- [Alfred] With all
due respect Miss Sue,

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:17.577
your mother's
antidote does not seem

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:22.082
