Wait, I did it.
I got Leela a ticket.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.363
(GASPS) How did you do that?

12:17.446 --> 12:22.409
Ah-ah-ah. A magician never reveals his
secrets. Except the Great Reveal-o.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.953
That guy stinks.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.210
(CROWD CLAMORING)

12:41.262 --> 12:43.722
I still don't see why
you get the window seat.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.977
Folks, this is your captain. Our
snake tanks are fully loaded,

12:48.060 --> 12:50.187
<i>so once I figure out
which button launches this...</i>

12:50.271 --> 12:52.523
(ALL <i>GAS P)
I figured it out!</i>

12:53.732 --> 12:55.234
(ALL SCREAMING)

13:05.703 --> 13:07.204
(ALL JEERING)

13:09.081 --> 13:10.708
Don't come back!

13:11.250 --> 13:13.210
Well, let's get looting!

13:14.336 --> 13:17.923
Fry, this is the most noble thing
anyone has ever done for rne.

13:18.549 --> 13:19.883
Wait, Fry?

13:20.050 --> 13:22.303
I'm a lot of people,
but I'm not Fry.

13:22.386 --> 13:23.387
(LAUGHS)

13:26.015 --> 13:27.224
Oh, no!

13:33.856 --> 13:35.024
(SNIFFLES)

13:55.461 --> 13:56.920
Welcome to Mars!

13:57.004 --> 13:59.173
It is with heavy heart
and open arms

13:59.256 --> 14:01.425
that we receive
Earth's only survivors.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.968
Admission, $20.

14:03.052 --> 14:04.845
Dad! Gleesh.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.180
Greetings, Mars men.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.974
We come to your planet
to construct a gleaming city,

14:09.266 --> 14:11.602
a second Earth on
which to begin anew.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.188
Okay. Admission, $20.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.441
I can't believe it. Fry
sacrificed his spot for me,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.610
and I never even had
a chance to thank him.

14:20.027 --> 14:25.783
Don't worry, Leela. Earth is still
there, peaceful and serene as ever.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.578
(ALARM WAILING)

14:32.289 --> 14:33.665
(CHUCKUNG)

14:45.969 --> 14:47.137
(GRUNTING)

14:48.472 --> 14:50.140
Bender! You're stealing
your own stuff!

14:50.307 --> 14:52.976
I am?
Geez, I better slow down.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.978
I'm stealing stuff
I don't even need.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.523
You want a Torah?
Nah, I'm not hungry.

14:57.815 --> 14:59.983
Aw, what's the matter?
Scared of dying?

15:00.275 --> 15:02.528
No. 'Cause as
long as Leela lives,

15:02.611 --> 15:04.822
I'll be alive, too,
in her heart.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.032
But really I'll be dead.

15:10.994 --> 15:15.207
Ladies and gentlemen, our new
Martian city is complete.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.127
I give you Dickfrancisco!

15:18.210 --> 15:19.420
(CHEERING)

15:23.173 --> 15:25.801
The doves didn't magically
spring from my hand,

15:25.926 --> 15:29.096
but rather were crammed into this
netting sewn into my sleeve!

15:29.179 --> 15:30.556
(MILD APPLAUSE)

15:30.639 --> 15:32.141
Thank you, Great Reveal-o.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.976
And now,
as a solemn testicle

15:34.059 --> 15:35.769
to those
left behind on Earth,

15:36.103 --> 15:39.773
I present this monument,
titled simply, "Heroes."

15:42.860 --> 15:43.861
(SNIFFLES)

15:43.944 --> 15:47.573
That frightened little girl in
the statue reminds me of Fry.

15:47.823 --> 15:49.116
(sesame)

15:49.199 --> 15:50.868
SINGING WIND:
Stop the ceremony.

15:53.245 --> 15:55.456
Who is this
non-Washington redskin?

15:55.747 --> 15:59.668
I am Singing Wind, chief of
the native Martian tribe.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.045
But I thought your people
abandoned this planet.

16:02.212 --> 16:05.090
We did. I just
came back for my stuff.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.218
VVhat're you guys doing here?
Fleeing Earth, of course.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.096
We flew here in your
great stone pyramid.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.557
Seriously?
That thing flies?

16:13.724 --> 16:16.643
Of course. Your people left
it so we could escape.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.521
I translated your warning
that the world was doomed.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.857
Not your world. Our world.

16:22.065 --> 16:25.027
We put calendar there
to warn you not to visit Mars.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.571
It Mars that
gonna be destroyed.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.739
(ALL GASPING)

16:28.989 --> 16:31.742
Why you think we so eager
to abandon this dump?

16:31.950 --> 16:36.205
You guys got 10, 15 minutes max.
VVeH,solong.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.087
Hey, Ancient Martian's
a very hard language.

16:44.213 --> 16:45.214
A... (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

16:45.297 --> 16:47.090
looksjust like a...
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

16:47.216 --> 16:48.509
(LIGHTNING)
(ALL SCREAMING)

16:51.386 --> 16:53.972
To the spaceship!
There is no spaceship.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.600
You had it dismantled
to build that statue.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.519
To the statue.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.188
(GROANING)

17:01.772 --> 17:06.318
Oh, what an idiot I was.
And by I mean "you."

17:06.609 --> 17:10.989
The final solar flare is going
to bypass Earth and strike Mars.

17:15.953 --> 17:17.246
(ALL SCREAMING)

17:28.549 --> 17:32.886
My God, one of the hundreds of
contradictory prophecies is coming true.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.555
I should've known better
than to trust

17:34.638 --> 17:36.181
one of Fry's
romantic gestures.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.517
Every time he says
he loves me, I get killed.

17:40.686 --> 17:43.397
It's just as I only
now began to fear.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.984
The solar flares are igniting
subsurface gas pockets.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.739
(SCREAMS)

17:52.823 --> 17:55.284
Mars is being blasted
out of its orbit.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.619
Fry, you noble idiot.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.588
(SLURPING)

18:07.671 --> 18:09.965
You're right, Bender,
grave robbing is fun.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.384
And these pifia skulladas
are fantastic.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.554
The crazy weather cleared up,
too, for whatever reason.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.515
All in all, it's a fine
day for an apocalypse.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.268
So you don't miss
what's-her-name?

18:21.351 --> 18:22.644
Of course I do.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.105
But even though
we're millions of miles apart,

18:25.397 --> 18:27.816
somehow, I feel
she's near me.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.610
Very near!

18:31.069 --> 18:32.404
(ALL SCREAMING)

18:35.115 --> 18:37.451
Oh no!
The kajigger of Gibraltar!

18:48.962 --> 18:51.089
I have got to quit drinking.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.301
Thanks, friend!

18:57.220 --> 19:00.766
Another great thing was she
always had room for dessert.

19:01.850 --> 19:02.851
(SCREAMS)

19:02.976 --> 19:05.812
We're passing surprisingly
close to Earth!

19:05.979 --> 19:08.607
When we reach
72nd Street, jump!

19:14.446 --> 19:15.989
Ah! (GRUNTS)

19:16.073 --> 19:17.157
Cushiony.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.700
(CHEERING)

19:18.784 --> 19:20.827
We made it.
We're back home.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.871
Okay, today is
still a workday, so...

19:22.954 --> 19:24.122
LEELAI Wait! Help!

19:24.581 --> 19:27.250
I'm still on Mars,
and I can'tjump!

19:27.709 --> 19:30.128
Hang on, Leela!
I'll save you again!

19:31.004 --> 19:32.464
Or somebody else could do it!

19:32.631 --> 19:33.882
(PANTING)

19:38.261 --> 19:39.596
Quick, take my hand.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.016
I don't know. Bad things
happen when you say that.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.274
<i>L</i> 9°T her!
Ow!

19:51.775 --> 19:52.818
Oops!

19:52.901 --> 19:55.612
Try again!
We're too far apart.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.949
No, we're not. Grab your severed
arm with your other arm.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.492
Ew...

20:00.575 --> 20:01.952
Okay.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.829
Hurray! (SCREAMS)

20:04.162 --> 20:05.580
(BOTH SCREAMING)

20:12.421 --> 20:14.798
Good thing
Scruffy rescued Leela.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.967
Don't thank me,
thanktheladden

20:17.300 --> 20:20.637
Your cloned arms should be
fully grown in a month or so.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.223
But for right now,
enjoy the sounds

20:23.306 --> 20:25.934
of the world's
smallest violin.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.064
I hope you're not
too mad at me, Leela,

20:31.148 --> 20:32.774
for tearing
your arm off and all.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.986
I can't be mad. I'm on way
too many painkillers.

20:36.445 --> 20:40.240
Plus, you were willing to sacrifice
yourself so I could live.

20:40.699 --> 20:43.493
I mean,
you failed, miserably,

20:43.910 --> 20:46.663
but you're the only person
who loves me enough to try.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.833
One last foolish gesture?

20:50.751 --> 20:51.752
Uh...
