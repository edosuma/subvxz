00:00.096 --> 00:02.764
<i>???</i>

00:02.832 --> 00:04.266
And tomorrow, you talk to Adrian.

00:04.333 --> 00:07.335
Whatever she decides to do about... this...

00:07.403 --> 00:10.071
- is her decision.
- I want you to tell Amy,

00:10.139 --> 00:11.473
and I want you to be as kind to Adrian...

00:11.541 --> 00:13.808
as you were to Amy when she was in this situation.

00:13.876 --> 00:15.176
Are you sure everything's okay?

00:16.412 --> 00:17.779
I told my dad.

00:17.847 --> 00:19.314
You promised me you'd give me a couple of days.

00:19.382 --> 00:21.383
If Amy wants to go to a music program in New York,

00:21.450 --> 00:22.851
<i>you should encourage her to do that.</i>

00:22.919 --> 00:24.319
Why? So she won't find out?

00:24.387 --> 00:25.887
I want to offer Adrian my help...

00:25.955 --> 00:27.489
by offering her some options.

00:27.557 --> 00:29.724
Why don't you just focus on you and your own life?

00:29.792 --> 00:31.993
I'm thinking I might get married.

00:32.061 --> 00:34.029
When you say you want to get married,

00:34.096 --> 00:35.797
you do mean to Tammy, don't you?

00:35.865 --> 00:37.966
You're absolutely sure you can find a place?

00:38.034 --> 00:39.701
If nothing else, Ricky said I could stay there.

00:39.769 --> 00:40.969
I think you need parents around.

00:41.037 --> 00:41.970
Then I'll stay with Coach.

00:42.038 --> 00:43.138
Something is going on.

00:43.205 --> 00:44.339
Not really.

00:44.407 --> 00:45.640
Something's going on with me.

00:45.708 --> 00:46.942
We're just gonna let her go to New York?

00:47.009 --> 00:48.310
I don't think we have a choice.

00:48.377 --> 00:50.278
I can't tell her,

00:50.346 --> 00:52.247
- not before she takes off.
- Which is when?

00:52.315 --> 00:53.281
Tomorrow.

00:53.349 --> 00:54.649
What's the matter?

00:54.717 --> 00:56.284
Adrian's pregnant.

01:18.140 --> 01:19.207
Hey, I'm downstairs.

01:19.275 --> 01:21.009
Can you come down here? It's an emergency.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.056
I want to talk.

01:35.124 --> 01:36.858
I have to talk to you about Adrian.

01:36.926 --> 01:39.127
What? That's the emergency?

01:39.195 --> 01:41.696
My dad told her dad that she's pregnant.

01:41.764 --> 01:42.897
And her mother got home last night,

01:42.965 --> 01:44.699
so I know they're all gonna be talking about it.

01:44.767 --> 01:45.934
Not at 5:00 in the morning.

01:46.002 --> 01:47.035
What are you doing here?

01:47.103 --> 01:48.670
You said if I needed to talk...

01:48.738 --> 01:50.238
Why didn't you come up?

01:50.306 --> 01:52.874
Because I don't know who you're with these days,

01:52.942 --> 01:53.875
if you're with anyone.

01:53.943 --> 01:55.710
I'm not, so talk.

01:55.778 --> 01:58.113
Two minutes ago I was asleep, so I
don't know how much help I can be.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.248
Okay. Here's the thing.

02:00.316 --> 02:02.550
I'm in a classic no-win situation.

02:02.618 --> 02:04.653
If Adrian has the baby, that's not good.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.022
If Adrian doesn't have the
baby, that's even horrible.

02:07.089 --> 02:08.990
And I have to take Amy to the airport,

02:09.058 --> 02:12.460
which is a classic no-win situation with a twist,

02:12.528 --> 02:15.096
now that I think about it. Don't think about it.

02:15.164 --> 02:16.698
If I don't talk about this...

02:16.766 --> 02:18.667
and get my head straightened
out, I'm gonna implode.

02:18.734 --> 02:20.802
Or is it explode? Wait. What is it?

02:20.870 --> 02:22.370
I don't know.

02:22.438 --> 02:25.006
But you're already a mess,
whether you implode or explode.

02:25.074 --> 02:26.574
Do you want Adrian to have the baby?

02:26.642 --> 02:28.009
I don't. No.

02:28.077 --> 02:29.711
I don't want her to go through with this.

02:29.779 --> 02:32.247
I mean, what are we gonna do with a baby?

02:32.314 --> 02:36.785
And if we have a baby, Amy and I are
never gonna be able to get back together.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.787
That's not a good enough
reason not to have the baby.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.990
You and Amy might not stay together baby or not.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.793
No, because she's gonna find
out that Adrian is pregnant...

02:44.860 --> 02:46.528
or that she terminated the pregnancy,

02:46.595 --> 02:47.696
and either way I lose,

02:47.763 --> 02:50.031
hence again, the classic no-win situation.

02:50.099 --> 02:51.766
Have you talked to Adrian?

02:51.834 --> 02:53.635
I tried. She doesn't want to talk.

02:53.703 --> 02:56.204
She's been pushing me away, putting
it off until her mother gets back...

02:56.272 --> 02:57.672
so that she can talk to her.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.307
I'm sure they're talking about abortion.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.875
I don't want an abortion,

03:00.943 --> 03:02.877
but I don't want a baby, hence, again, the...

03:02.945 --> 03:05.013
Don't say it. What do I do?

03:06.182 --> 03:07.582
I mean, what do I do?

03:07.650 --> 03:09.651
I've been talking to my
dad. I'm talking to you now.

03:09.719 --> 03:11.086
I've been talking to myself for days,

03:11.153 --> 03:12.353
and still I don't know what to do,

03:12.421 --> 03:13.722
or if there really is anything to do,

03:13.789 --> 03:16.725
other than do what Adrian
says and just stay out of it.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.760
But if I stay out of it... You're on a loop now.

03:18.828 --> 03:20.528
You're like a cartoon character chasing his tail,

03:20.596 --> 03:22.030
spinning around until he burrows himself...

03:22.098 --> 03:23.298
into the center of the earth.

03:23.365 --> 03:25.533
Stop. What cartoon character?

03:25.601 --> 03:26.768
I don't know.

03:26.836 --> 03:28.670
Ben, I can't decide this for you.

03:28.738 --> 03:30.071
You can't even decide this for you.

03:30.139 --> 03:32.307
You're gonna have to let Adrian decide this.

03:32.374 --> 03:35.643
And whatever she decides, you go along with her.

03:35.711 --> 03:37.879
If I know Adrian, she's not gonna have a baby.

03:37.947 --> 03:38.880
That's just the thing.

03:38.948 --> 03:40.348
Maybe I should go over there...

03:40.416 --> 03:41.950
and try to talk her out of not having the baby.

03:42.017 --> 03:45.453
But then if I do that, then I have a baby.

03:45.521 --> 03:47.021
You're still spinning.

03:47.089 --> 03:48.056
Look, there's nothing you can do.

03:48.124 --> 03:49.390
Stay out of it.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.526
My dad told me to get involved.

03:51.594 --> 03:54.462
Oh, then do what he said, and leave me out of it.

03:54.530 --> 03:56.064
You said I could talk to you.

03:56.132 --> 03:58.633
Talk to me after the decision's been made.

03:58.701 --> 04:00.235
This sucks.

04:00.302 --> 04:04.105
Hey, what's going on?

04:06.542 --> 04:07.542
Will you ever learn?

04:09.979 --> 04:11.179
Will I?

04:18.120 --> 04:19.788
What was that?

04:19.855 --> 04:22.590
That was a guy in a no-win situation.

04:22.658 --> 04:25.360
Ben Boykewich in a no-win situation?

04:26.762 --> 04:28.730
What could that be?

04:28.798 --> 04:30.632
What can't Ben Boykewich buy his way out of?

04:30.699 --> 04:32.233
Come on, it's freezing down here.

04:32.301 --> 04:34.002
Let's go back to bed.

04:34.069 --> 04:35.436
Tell me.

04:35.504 --> 04:37.372
It's nothing.

04:37.439 --> 04:39.440
You ever done it in a butcher shop?

04:40.843 --> 04:42.710
There are security cameras.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.446
That could be fun.

04:45.514 --> 04:47.448
Back upstairs.

04:52.955 --> 04:55.256

05:24.943 --> 05:26.009
Adrian?

05:28.179 --> 05:30.013
Good morning. Good morning.

05:31.883 --> 05:33.216
What time did you get home?

05:33.284 --> 05:34.885
I don't know. It was really late...

05:34.953 --> 05:36.053
after midnight.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.988
I'm glad you're here.

05:38.056 --> 05:39.856
I have to talk to you.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.960
I really have to talk to you.

05:43.027 --> 05:46.096
All right. You want something for breakfast?

05:46.164 --> 05:49.232
Yeah, maybe, I think so.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.069
Come on. I'll make you whatever you want.

05:52.136 --> 05:53.637
Okay.

06:01.713 --> 06:03.313
You're not going to like this.

06:03.381 --> 06:08.285
No? No.

06:08.353 --> 06:10.320
Okay, so what can I get for you?

06:10.388 --> 06:12.222
Pancakes or eggs or something?

06:12.290 --> 06:13.957
I think we're out of eggs.

06:14.025 --> 06:17.260
Oh. Well...

06:17.328 --> 06:20.530
how about some toast and some blackberry jam.

06:20.598 --> 06:22.933
Yeah, that sounds good.

06:23.001 --> 06:24.668
You stole blackberry jam for me?

06:24.736 --> 06:25.902
You haven't done that in ages.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.904
I didn't steal it, Adrian.

06:27.972 --> 06:30.073
It's on the flight, and I get
it just like the passengers.

06:30.141 --> 06:32.476
Whatever you say.

07:00.838 --> 07:04.107
Mom... It's okay, Adrian.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.242
I know.

07:05.309 --> 07:07.210
You know what?

07:07.278 --> 07:09.046
That you're pregnant.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.847
How do you know that?

07:10.915 --> 07:14.051
Leo told Ruben, and Ruben told me.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.320
I knew that sausage king would do that.

07:17.388 --> 07:20.524
I knew it.

07:20.591 --> 07:23.060
So these stupid men go out to
dinner to handle my business?

07:23.127 --> 07:25.028
Is that where he was last night? Ruben?

07:25.096 --> 07:28.131
Who are they to think that
everything is their business?

07:28.199 --> 07:29.399
It's none of their business.

07:29.467 --> 07:31.268
It's my business and only my business.

07:31.335 --> 07:32.703
I completely agree with you.

07:32.770 --> 07:36.773
Really? Really.

07:36.841 --> 07:39.543
Adrian, I'm okay with whatever you want to do.

07:39.610 --> 07:41.878
It's a tough decision, the toughest,

07:41.946 --> 07:45.048
and I'm so sorry you find
yourself in this position...

07:45.116 --> 07:47.517
and having to make this decision.

07:47.585 --> 07:49.386
It's my fault.

07:50.655 --> 07:52.389
I did this.

07:52.457 --> 07:55.392
Me and my stupid plan to
get back at Amy and Ricky.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.061
How far along are you?

07:58.129 --> 08:00.764
I don't know.

08:00.832 --> 08:04.601
I think about five weeks, maybe six.

08:04.669 --> 08:07.104
Do you want to go through with this pregnancy?

08:10.808 --> 08:14.311
I... I don't think so.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.682
Mom, I talked to a counselor at the clinic.

08:20.551 --> 08:24.121
I think I want to have an abortion.

08:27.425 --> 08:28.959
What do you think I should do?

08:29.026 --> 08:31.595
You want to know what I think?

08:31.662 --> 08:32.962
Yeah, I do,

08:33.030 --> 08:34.898
even if it's not what I think.

08:34.966 --> 08:40.303
When I got pregnant with you,

08:40.371 --> 08:41.638
I was scared to death...

08:41.706 --> 08:43.774
to even think about what you're thinking about.

08:46.043 --> 08:48.478
I wouldn't even consider the idea of an abortion.

08:48.546 --> 08:50.280
I thought I'd go straight to hell...

08:52.116 --> 08:55.418
but soon I realized that I was already there.

08:57.155 --> 08:58.989
My mother wouldn't let me out of the house.

08:59.056 --> 09:01.958
She said I had shamed the family.

09:04.295 --> 09:07.364
My father wouldn't even be
with me in the same room.

09:09.400 --> 09:14.671
We quit eating together as a family.

09:14.739 --> 09:17.874
They let me stay there, but it was horrible.

09:17.942 --> 09:19.876
It was absolutely horrible,

09:19.944 --> 09:23.413
and I had to live with their judgment...

09:23.481 --> 09:28.852
and their comments the whole pregnancy,

09:28.920 --> 09:32.322
but after eight weeks...

09:32.390 --> 09:35.826
yeah, eight weeks after you were born,

09:35.893 --> 09:37.661
I found a job,

09:37.728 --> 09:39.729
the best job I could find,

09:39.797 --> 09:43.033
and that's when I started
working with the airlines.

09:44.702 --> 09:46.069
It was the most money I could make,

09:46.137 --> 09:48.605
and I was thrilled,

09:48.673 --> 09:52.175
but that meant that when I had to fly,

09:52.243 --> 09:54.544
I had to leave you with my mother,

09:54.612 --> 09:56.613
and we would fight all the time.

09:58.783 --> 10:01.685
But eventually when I could afford it,

10:01.752 --> 10:03.620
we moved out, you and me.

10:05.356 --> 10:07.691
The apartment with the green and yellow tile...

10:07.758 --> 10:09.593
and the built-in bookcase in the halfway.

10:09.660 --> 10:11.761
Yeah, that one.

10:11.829 --> 10:14.998
And I went from asking my
mother to help me with you...

10:15.066 --> 10:17.567
to ask my friends and neighbors to watch you...

10:17.635 --> 10:20.403
Mrs. Vasquez? Evelyn?

10:24.141 --> 10:25.976
And as you grew up, I...

10:27.979 --> 10:31.281
I missed the birthdays...

10:31.349 --> 10:34.517
and the holidays...

10:34.585 --> 10:39.322
and the first times...

10:39.390 --> 10:40.857
and the first time you took a step.

10:43.527 --> 10:47.397
The first day of school.

10:47.465 --> 10:48.899
Your first date.

10:48.966 --> 10:51.568
It's okay. You had to.

10:51.636 --> 10:54.537
No... no, it's not okay,

10:54.605 --> 10:56.539
and I felt guilty my whole life.

10:58.976 --> 11:00.810
I've always felt that I wasn't the best mother.

11:00.878 --> 11:04.314
I know I wasn't,

11:04.382 --> 11:07.350
and I've always felt that you deserve better.

11:10.221 --> 11:14.391
And sometimes I've questioned myself,

11:14.458 --> 11:16.026
if you would have been better off...

11:16.093 --> 11:19.362
if I had allowed a wonderful couple to adopt you.

11:20.932 --> 11:22.666
Why are you telling me this?

11:22.733 --> 11:24.801
You want me to actually go through with this?

11:24.869 --> 11:26.937
Have the baby and then put
the baby up for adoption?

11:27.004 --> 11:29.172
No, Adrian, I'm not trying to tell you to do that.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.076
I'm not trying to tell you to do anything at all.

11:33.144 --> 11:34.644
I'm just trying to be there for you...

11:34.712 --> 11:36.046
for once in my life.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.614
You've been there for me...

11:37.682 --> 11:38.982
as much as you could be there for me.

11:39.050 --> 11:41.318
No, I haven't.

11:43.955 --> 11:49.392
Not until recently I could tell myself the truth,

11:49.460 --> 11:51.661
and I want to tell you the truth.

11:53.731 --> 11:56.399
I could've given up that job.

11:57.868 --> 11:59.269
I could've done something else.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.308
But when I was away,

12:05.376 --> 12:08.545
I loved being a single woman...

12:08.612 --> 12:10.580
with no responsibilities.

12:13.117 --> 12:15.885
And the men I brought home, Adrian...

12:15.953 --> 12:17.487
Yeah.

12:17.555 --> 12:22.058
Some of them were... less than you deserved.

12:22.126 --> 12:24.461
And I know you resented them,

12:24.528 --> 12:26.329
and you resented me,

12:26.397 --> 12:30.233
and I resented you, too,

12:30.301 --> 12:32.502
but somehow, some way...

12:32.570 --> 12:34.738
thanks to some miracle,

12:34.805 --> 12:35.905
we grew up.

12:37.141 --> 12:38.908
And now we're here...

12:38.976 --> 12:40.076
in this house...

12:40.144 --> 12:41.711
with this wonderful man,

12:41.779 --> 12:44.781
your father and my husband Ruben.

12:44.849 --> 12:46.616
And I'm not going to fail you now.

12:48.452 --> 12:50.153
You need me now more than ever.

12:51.956 --> 12:53.957
And no matter what your decision is,

12:54.025 --> 12:55.125
I'm here.

12:58.729 --> 13:00.597
How is it that the worst day in my life...

13:00.664 --> 13:02.599
also feels like the best day in my life?

13:02.666 --> 13:04.634
Because everything is so much easier...

13:04.702 --> 13:05.935
when you have someone to love you,

13:06.003 --> 13:08.972
and I love you, Adrian, I love you so much,

13:09.040 --> 13:11.941
but no matter what you decide,
it's not going to be easy.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.547
Mom, I don't want to have a baby.

13:17.615 --> 13:21.751
You don't have to. It's a choice.

13:21.819 --> 13:25.321
And it's not because you weren't a
good mother or anything like that.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.224
It's just... I can't.

13:28.292 --> 13:30.226
I can't have a baby.

13:30.294 --> 13:32.128
I did everything I was supposed to do...

13:32.196 --> 13:33.797
and I still got pregnant,

13:33.864 --> 13:37.033
and I don't want to be pregnant.

13:37.101 --> 13:38.968
It's okay, Adrian. It's okay.

13:40.971 --> 13:43.039
But if you want to take another day or two...

13:43.107 --> 13:45.842
to think this over,

13:45.910 --> 13:48.711
I think you should, Take another day or two.

14:02.251 --> 14:04.086
So you are going to school?

14:04.153 --> 14:06.989
Isn't that the point of Mom telling
me I don't have to go to school,

14:07.056 --> 14:08.123
that I'm empowered...

14:08.191 --> 14:09.224
and I come to the correct conclusion...

14:09.292 --> 14:11.159
she wanted me to come to in the first place?

14:11.227 --> 14:12.794
I'm not going to work, and
your mom's not going anywhere,

14:12.862 --> 14:14.229
and you don't have to go to school...

14:14.297 --> 14:16.198
because Amy's leaving at
noon for the airport with Ben.

14:16.265 --> 14:17.432
We're all going to be here to say good-bye.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.567
All but me.

14:18.635 --> 14:20.135
I'm going to school. I hate good-byes.

14:20.203 --> 14:21.703
So do I. I've got to be here...

14:21.771 --> 14:22.771
and I don't want to drive you to school.

14:22.839 --> 14:24.006
Great. Give me the keys.

14:24.073 --> 14:25.273
Oh...

14:25.341 --> 14:26.408
Just stay home.

14:26.476 --> 14:27.476
I can't.

14:27.543 --> 14:30.579
I was home the day before yesterday.

14:30.647 --> 14:32.080
I'll say good-bye to Amy right now.

14:32.148 --> 14:33.415
She left to take John to the nursery.

14:33.483 --> 14:34.983
What, so John's not going to be here?

14:35.051 --> 14:36.585
She wants to keep him on
the schedule he's always on,

14:36.653 --> 14:38.020
and she doesn't want him to be upset...

14:38.087 --> 14:39.554
when she goes out the door with her suitcase,

14:39.622 --> 14:41.556
so Ricky's going to pick him up
after work and bring him home,

14:41.624 --> 14:43.525
and then he's going to be
staying here for a month,

14:43.593 --> 14:44.860
and while he's here,

14:44.927 --> 14:47.262
I don't want you and Ricky to be near each other.

14:47.330 --> 14:48.296
I see the way he looks at you,

14:48.364 --> 14:49.531
and I see the way you look at him.

14:49.599 --> 14:51.366
You to aren't fooling me or anyone else.

14:51.434 --> 14:52.668
I have a boyfriend...

14:52.735 --> 14:54.002
kind of.

14:54.070 --> 14:55.237
Who? Grant.

14:55.304 --> 14:58.106
And there he is now.

14:58.174 --> 15:01.209
<i>Hi, Grant. Wow, you finally picked up.</i>

15:01.277 --> 15:05.280
<i>Where've you been? Around.</i>

15:05.348 --> 15:07.549
Look, you can't transfer to my school.

15:07.617 --> 15:10.152
That's a bad, bad idea.

15:10.219 --> 15:11.653
<i>Oh, yeah? Yeah.</i>

15:11.721 --> 15:13.021
Somebody's got to keep an eye on you.

15:13.089 --> 15:14.322
Might as well be someone who loves you.

15:14.390 --> 15:17.559
Oh, please. We are not in love.

15:17.627 --> 15:20.195
<i>You don't love me, and
I don't ne a handler,</i>

15:20.263 --> 15:21.530
so just stay at your own school...

15:21.597 --> 15:23.065
and worship me from afar.

15:23.132 --> 15:24.766
You can't go out with your nephew's father...

15:24.834 --> 15:26.535
who'd ordinarily be
your brother-in-law.

15:26.602 --> 15:28.170
Who, Ricky?

15:28.237 --> 15:29.471
We're friends.

15:29.539 --> 15:30.806
Friends, huh?

15:30.873 --> 15:32.641
Trust me, that guy wants to be more than friends.

15:32.709 --> 15:33.809
Well, so do you.

15:33.876 --> 15:35.343
Come on, Ashley, just give me a shot.

15:35.411 --> 15:36.545
Go out with me, please.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.013
I can't go out.

15:38.081 --> 15:39.414
Amy's leaving for four weeks,

15:39.482 --> 15:41.416
and I have to help take care of John,

15:41.484 --> 15:43.151
and Ricky's going to be here...

15:43.219 --> 15:44.186
helping to take care of him,

15:44.253 --> 15:46.221
so it would just be awkward.

15:46.289 --> 15:48.523
He's going to be there?

15:48.591 --> 15:49.891
Like living there?

15:49.959 --> 15:51.193
Yeah, he is.

15:59.302 --> 16:01.536
I need a ride.

16:01.604 --> 16:02.938
I thought I just overheard...

16:03.005 --> 16:04.706
Mom telling you you could take the bus.

16:04.774 --> 16:06.408
I can't take a bus.

16:06.476 --> 16:09.111
I know how to take the bus,

16:09.178 --> 16:12.314
but I would prefer to ride in a car.

16:12.381 --> 16:14.516
Where's your job interview?

16:14.584 --> 16:16.118
Decor House.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.385
Really? What's the job?

16:17.453 --> 16:18.553
Bailiff.

16:18.621 --> 16:19.888
Bailiff?

16:19.956 --> 16:21.857
The mail room.

16:21.924 --> 16:23.458
Well, I would give you a ride, Tom,

16:23.526 --> 16:25.827
but I really need to get to school.

16:25.895 --> 16:27.162
Want to talk to Adrian...

16:27.230 --> 16:28.864
because she's not returning my text...

16:28.931 --> 16:29.865
or my phone calls,

16:29.932 --> 16:31.666
and it's just really hurtful...

16:31.734 --> 16:33.135
because she's my best friend.

16:33.202 --> 16:34.469
How is Adrian?

16:34.537 --> 16:36.705
I don't know,

16:36.773 --> 16:39.875
but I do know that you overheard
what I was saying the other night,

16:39.942 --> 16:41.943
and I really hope you don't
say anything to anyone.

16:42.011 --> 16:45.247
Who would I say something to? Tammy?

16:45.314 --> 16:49.017
I don't think Tammy would want to know about that.

16:49.085 --> 16:51.820
Okay, just promise me you won't say
anything, and then I'll give you a ride.

16:51.888 --> 16:53.655
I can drop you off and then
you can just take the bus home.

16:53.723 --> 16:55.157
Promise.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.491
I really hope you get the job.

16:56.559 --> 16:58.126
I think it'll be good for you to have a job...

16:58.194 --> 17:01.062
and save up some money and
then maybe get married some day.

17:01.130 --> 17:03.231
Me, too. All right, come on.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.204
She's leaving at noon.

17:09.271 --> 17:11.673
Noon our time or New York time?

17:11.741 --> 17:14.009
Uh, she's leaving from here, our time,

17:14.076 --> 17:15.109
noon our time.

17:15.178 --> 17:18.380
OH, so last night's
good-bye was good-bye.

17:18.446 --> 17:20.214
Yeah, and now that she's almost gone,

17:20.282 --> 17:22.017
I can tell you something that
I've been wanting to tell you...

17:22.084 --> 17:23.117
but I couldn't really tell you.

17:23.185 --> 17:25.619
All right. Oh, but first I want to tell you...

17:25.688 --> 17:28.223
that I talked to my mom
and my step dad about Jack,

17:28.290 --> 17:30.725
and he can live at our house. What?

17:30.793 --> 17:33.228
He and Jason are friends,
and we have a guest room,

17:33.296 --> 17:35.197
and they don't really care.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.899
Well, I care. What do you mean?

17:37.967 --> 17:40.869
My boyfriend's not going to
live at my best friend's house.

17:40.937 --> 17:42.270
Why not?

17:42.338 --> 17:44.105
Look, okay, you're my best friend.

17:44.173 --> 17:45.707
I trust you more than anybody,

17:45.775 --> 17:47.943
but this is just a bad idea.

17:48.010 --> 17:49.911
In fact it stinks.

17:49.979 --> 17:52.147
So, in other words, you don't trust me.

17:52.215 --> 17:53.715
No, I...

17:53.783 --> 17:56.484
I just... I don't trust Jack.

17:56.552 --> 17:59.621
He's got a very high testosterone
level, off the charts.

17:59.689 --> 18:01.656
I mean, he could be, like,
genius level for testosterone,

18:01.724 --> 18:04.059
and he's also a liar,

18:04.126 --> 18:06.261
and that's just a lethal combination.

18:06.329 --> 18:07.996
He's going to just show up in your room...

18:08.064 --> 18:11.700
and say that he's a
somnambulist or a narcoleptic...

18:11.767 --> 18:14.703
or that he's got, like, sleep
apnea or something, and...

18:14.770 --> 18:16.238
just thanks, but no, thanks.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.907
Fine, whatever.

18:18.975 --> 18:20.675
What was it that you wanted to tell me?

18:20.743 --> 18:23.478
Oh, I think Adrian's pregnant with Ben's baby.

18:23.546 --> 18:25.447
How long have you known about this,

18:25.514 --> 18:28.149
that Adrian is pregnant with Ben's baby?

18:28.217 --> 18:30.552
Well, I don't know this, not for sure,

18:30.620 --> 18:33.321
but I think she slept maybe for, like, a week now.

18:33.389 --> 18:35.257
Did you tell Amy?

18:35.324 --> 18:36.558
Are you kidding?

18:36.626 --> 18:37.559
I couldn't.

18:37.627 --> 18:39.060
Jack told me not to tell anyone.

18:39.128 --> 18:42.097
And since when is Jack more
important than me, your best friend...

18:42.164 --> 18:44.299
and Amy, your other best friend?

18:44.367 --> 18:47.435
Well, since Jack and I
started doing what we're doing.

18:47.503 --> 18:50.071
Jesse and I are doing that, too,

18:50.139 --> 18:52.941
and I still treat you like
you're more important than Jesse.

18:53.009 --> 18:55.577
You and Jesse? No, you're not.

18:55.645 --> 18:56.878
You told Jack you're not.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.015
All right, then we're not,

19:00.082 --> 19:01.549
but if I would have known something like this,

19:01.617 --> 19:04.853
I would've told you.

19:04.921 --> 19:07.889
Is she going to have the baby?

19:07.957 --> 19:10.225
I don't think so, but you never know.

19:10.293 --> 19:12.060
Do you think Ben's going to tell Amy...

19:12.128 --> 19:13.461
before she leaves for New York?

19:13.529 --> 19:14.963
I doubt it.

19:15.031 --> 19:16.331
I mean, I didn't tell her,
and I'm her best friend...

19:16.399 --> 19:18.199
and yours. Mm.

19:18.267 --> 19:19.901
Hey, Madison, Lauren.

19:19.969 --> 19:21.469
I was just talking to Jason,

19:21.537 --> 19:23.204
and he said I could stay in your guest room.

19:23.272 --> 19:24.706
No, you can't.

19:24.774 --> 19:25.840
No, you can't.

19:25.908 --> 19:27.075
Oh.

19:28.544 --> 19:29.744
Hey, Coach.

19:29.812 --> 19:31.146
What's up, Pappas?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.781
My dad got a job in Arizona.

19:32.848 --> 19:34.416
He and my mom have to move out of state,

19:34.483 --> 19:36.384
so I was wondering if I could live at your house,

19:36.452 --> 19:37.686
you know, just for my senior year.

19:37.753 --> 19:40.422
What? I need a place to live my senior year...

19:40.489 --> 19:41.957
so I can stay in the district,

19:42.024 --> 19:43.325
so I was wondering if I could live with you.

19:43.392 --> 19:44.659
Let me ask you a question.

19:44.727 --> 19:46.294
Shoot. Are you on crack?

19:46.362 --> 19:48.330
Huh? You can't live at my house.

19:48.397 --> 19:50.966
Why not? Because it's totally inappropriate...

19:51.033 --> 19:52.867
for a student to live at a teacher's house.

19:52.935 --> 19:55.470
I think you misunderstood me.
It's nothing inappropriate.

19:55.538 --> 19:57.505
It's not like I'm asking to
sleep with you or something.

19:57.573 --> 19:59.374
I'm not hitting on you. What?

19:59.442 --> 20:01.509
I mean, you're a good-looking guy and everything,

20:01.577 --> 20:04.312
but you're the coach, and I'm not into guys,

20:04.380 --> 20:05.914
not that I have an issue with guys that are.

20:05.982 --> 20:07.349
I'm just not.

20:07.416 --> 20:10.051
My wife of 17 years and I have four children,

20:10.119 --> 20:12.821
and I depend on this job to support my family,

20:12.888 --> 20:14.689
and I am not interested...

20:14.757 --> 20:16.157
in you living at our house...

20:16.225 --> 20:18.693
or in continuing this conversation,

20:18.761 --> 20:20.095
but you find a place to live,

20:20.162 --> 20:22.430
better sooner than later.

20:22.498 --> 20:24.799
Can he live with me?

20:24.867 --> 20:27.502
What the heck is wrong with these kids today?

20:41.517 --> 20:42.884
Hi, Adrian.

20:42.952 --> 20:45.320
You know, I was over at Ricky's this morning.

20:45.388 --> 20:46.688
I'm sorry.

20:46.756 --> 20:48.356
I was over there all night long,

20:48.424 --> 20:50.525
and this morning Ben came by to see him.

20:50.593 --> 20:53.828
You know, Ben seems to be having a problem,

20:53.896 --> 20:55.864
a big problem.

20:55.931 --> 20:59.434
I mean, I couldn't really hear
exactly what they were saying,

20:59.502 --> 21:02.871
but then I remember that the
two of you had sex in his car.

21:02.938 --> 21:06.374
It was all over school, and
so I was just wondering...

21:06.442 --> 21:09.644
if maybe that little incident
resulted in an unwanted...

21:09.712 --> 21:11.980
Ow! Don't say another word.

21:13.416 --> 21:15.450
Don't worry. I won't have to.

21:17.553 --> 21:21.423
Everyone will know soon enough, and you know what?

21:21.490 --> 21:24.526
It couldn't have happened
to a more deserving person.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.801
I guess she's assuming I'm going to have a baby.

21:32.868 --> 21:34.235
And?

21:34.303 --> 21:35.770
And I'm not.

21:42.547 --> 21:46.550
She'll be fine, George. Amy will be fine.

21:46.618 --> 21:48.585
She has to do this. We have to let her go.

21:48.653 --> 21:50.187
It's important that she do this.

21:50.255 --> 21:52.055
It's New York, and she's 16,

21:52.123 --> 21:54.491
and she's just incredibly naive.

21:54.559 --> 21:55.926
She's not that naive, George.

21:55.994 --> 21:57.995
She's almost 17, and she's a mother.

21:58.062 --> 22:00.898
New York is going to be a
great experience for her.

22:00.965 --> 22:02.266
It'll be so wonderful...

22:02.333 --> 22:03.734
to be able to focus on her music again...

22:03.801 --> 22:05.202
for a change.

22:05.270 --> 22:08.071
So she's just going to get
off at Kennedy Airport...

22:08.139 --> 22:10.507
and get her luggage and get
into a taxi all by herself.

22:10.575 --> 22:12.676
Yes, and when she gets to the dorm,

22:12.744 --> 22:14.711
there will be somebody there waiting to help her,

22:14.779 --> 22:16.547
and she has a whole list of phone numbers...

22:16.614 --> 22:17.881
in case she has a problem.

22:17.949 --> 22:20.417
They've written out very
specific directions for her.

22:20.485 --> 22:21.919
She'll be fine.

22:21.986 --> 22:23.754
How could she leave John for four weeks?

22:23.821 --> 22:25.422
It's four weeks, Anne.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.791
He might be a little bit fussy at first,

22:27.859 --> 22:28.992
but he'll adjust,

22:29.060 --> 22:30.961
and if he's really upset and unhappy,

22:31.029 --> 22:33.864
then, hey, it's just a plane ride away.

22:33.932 --> 22:35.699
Someone can take him to go see Amy,

22:35.767 --> 22:37.301
or Amy can come here on the weekend,

22:37.368 --> 22:38.435
but I really think that John and Amy...

22:38.503 --> 22:39.870
are going to be fine.

22:39.938 --> 22:43.240
She's a lot more mature
than you give her credit for.

22:43.308 --> 22:45.008
So are you.

22:45.076 --> 22:47.377
Thanks.

22:47.445 --> 22:49.713
What's up, Tom?

22:49.781 --> 22:52.849
Hey, buddy of mine, I need some help.

22:52.917 --> 22:54.051
Oh, we're buddies again?

22:54.118 --> 22:55.852
<i>Of course. All right, what do you need?</i>

22:55.920 --> 22:58.088
I need a ride. I'm lost.

22:58.156 --> 22:59.556
All right, don't panic, Tom.

22:59.624 --> 23:01.358
Just find an address on a door or something,

23:01.426 --> 23:03.427
and I'll find you.

23:03.494 --> 23:06.363
So your dad called me this morning. What? Again?

23:06.431 --> 23:08.532
He wants to know if you're interested in Grant.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.034
Specifically he asked if you
two are up to something...

23:11.102 --> 23:13.003
or up to nothing.

23:13.071 --> 23:14.738
What did you tell him?

23:14.806 --> 23:16.273
I don't remember.

23:16.341 --> 23:19.009
Did you tell him you might be interested in Grant?

23:19.077 --> 23:20.978
Because Grant would be
really thrilled to hear that.

23:21.045 --> 23:23.380
Look, Grant knows I'm not
really interested in him,

23:23.448 --> 23:26.083
and Grant knows I don't really
want him to transfer here.

23:26.150 --> 23:27.384
Which is not going to stop him.

23:27.452 --> 23:29.086
Grant thinks you're interested in Ricky,

23:29.153 --> 23:30.387
and so does your dad.

23:30.455 --> 23:32.623
Are you interested in Ricky?

23:32.690 --> 23:34.057
I find that a little hard to believe.

23:34.125 --> 23:36.193
He's delusional and insanely jealous.

23:36.260 --> 23:39.896
I'm your best friend. You can tell me.

23:39.964 --> 23:41.064
Hey, Griffin. Hey.

23:41.132 --> 23:42.733
Ashley.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.334
So Amy get off all right?

23:44.402 --> 23:45.535
Yeah, I guess.

23:45.603 --> 23:47.738
Ben was supposed to be picking her up at noon,

23:47.805 --> 23:49.506
and they should be at the airport by now.

23:49.574 --> 23:51.308
All right. I'll pick up John after work,

23:51.376 --> 23:52.809
and I'll see you tonight.

23:52.877 --> 23:54.144
Okay.

23:57.148 --> 24:00.484
Oh, no. Oh, come on, that's not right.

24:00.551 --> 24:01.785
What's not right?

24:01.853 --> 24:03.553
Look, Grant is the marrying kind.

24:03.621 --> 24:07.491
Ricky's the father of your sister's baby kind.

24:07.558 --> 24:10.127
I mean, don't be stupid here.
Do the right thing for yourself.

24:10.194 --> 24:11.294
Which would be?

24:11.362 --> 24:13.296
Do not get involved with Ricky.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.931
And come on, at least give Grant a chance.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.533
He's a really nice guy,

24:16.601 --> 24:18.902
and you're a really nice girl, Ashley.

24:18.970 --> 24:20.137
You two could be good together.

24:20.204 --> 24:22.506
I know. I'm just...

24:22.573 --> 24:23.674
afraid of getting involved...

24:23.741 --> 24:24.975
with anyone in high school,

24:25.043 --> 24:27.411
and Ricky and I are just friends...

24:27.478 --> 24:28.545
family, really...

24:28.613 --> 24:30.047
and I like him,

24:30.114 --> 24:33.417
but I like him because he's
the father of my sister's baby,

24:33.484 --> 24:35.485
and he's a good father.

24:35.553 --> 24:37.220
I admire him really.

24:37.288 --> 24:39.923
And, true, maybe I should give Grant a chance,

24:39.991 --> 24:43.193
but Grant could actually break my heart...

24:43.261 --> 24:45.262
if I chose to care for him.

24:45.329 --> 24:47.998
Oh, you're good.

24:48.066 --> 24:50.667
You are really good, and you may play your dad,

24:50.735 --> 24:52.035
but not me, honey.

24:52.103 --> 24:54.504
I do not believe a word of that.

25:06.384 --> 25:07.984
I'm going to miss you so much.

25:08.052 --> 25:09.486
I'm going to miss you, too, Ben.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.058
Hey, you two, the airline escort's waiting...

25:15.126 --> 25:16.660
to take Amy through security,

25:16.728 --> 25:19.996
so finish up your good-byes and...

25:21.099 --> 25:22.866
Benjamin!

25:25.970 --> 25:27.537
Bye, Ben.

25:27.605 --> 25:29.673
I love you. I love you, too, Amy.

25:33.611 --> 25:34.878
I'll take that.

25:34.946 --> 25:36.146
Thank you.

25:38.649 --> 25:41.218
Thanks again, Mr. Boykewich, for everything.

25:41.285 --> 25:42.686
Take good care of Ben.

25:42.754 --> 25:45.655
I will, Amy. I will. See you soon.

25:51.496 --> 25:53.430
What the hell was that?

25:53.498 --> 25:55.031
What? I was just saying good-bye,

25:55.099 --> 25:57.033
and it might be my last
chance to make out with Amy,

25:57.101 --> 25:59.136
so I want to make the most of it.

25:59.203 --> 26:02.038
Look, it's my future that's
walking away from this car...

26:02.106 --> 26:03.440
and getting on that plane.

26:03.508 --> 26:04.875
I'm going to marry that girl,

26:04.942 --> 26:06.009
and no one's going to get in the way...

26:06.077 --> 26:07.244
of my life with Amy and John.

26:07.311 --> 26:09.012
Unless Adrian has your baby.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.747
Adrian is not going to have my baby,

26:10.815 --> 26:13.183
and you stop trying to make her have a baby.

26:13.251 --> 26:14.885
She's too selfish to have a baby.

26:14.952 --> 26:16.419
So am I.

26:20.725 --> 26:22.526
Yet I'm too scared of her having an abortion.

26:24.328 --> 26:25.695
Help me, Dad.

26:25.763 --> 26:28.698
Help me fix this. Make this all go away, please.

26:28.766 --> 26:31.234
You're good at this. You're a problem solver.

26:31.302 --> 26:32.736
Solve this problem for me.

26:32.804 --> 26:36.706
I can't, Ben. I can't.

26:53.578 --> 26:54.611
Thanks.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.446
Hey, you know there's an app on your phone...

26:56.514 --> 26:57.748
so you can map out where you are...

26:57.815 --> 26:58.882
and where you need to get to?

26:58.950 --> 27:00.250
That way you won't get lost.

27:00.318 --> 27:02.619
I wasn't lost. What?

27:02.687 --> 27:04.554
I hate taking the bus.

27:04.622 --> 27:06.490
See ya, sucker.

27:06.557 --> 27:08.358
You were lost.

27:08.426 --> 27:10.560
I was not lost.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.329
Well, I need to get back to school.

27:12.397 --> 27:14.431
Should I tell Grace that
you got the job if I see her?

27:14.499 --> 27:15.632
If you want,

27:15.700 --> 27:21.438
and tell her I am moving soon as I can...

27:21.506 --> 27:24.441
because I am getting married.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.109
No kidding, you're moving?

27:26.177 --> 27:27.277
Where you moving?

27:27.345 --> 27:28.645
Maybe the guest house,

27:28.713 --> 27:30.881
even if it's haunted.

27:30.949 --> 27:33.083
I need a priest quick.

27:33.151 --> 27:36.253
The guest house, huh?

27:36.321 --> 27:39.189
Hey, if you're too scare to
stay out there by yourself,

27:39.257 --> 27:40.390
maybe I could crash with you.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.925
Mom said no.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.227
They told you no already.

27:45.797 --> 27:46.763
Yeah.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.367
Hi.

27:52.337 --> 27:55.205
Oh, look who's at work early.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.874
Yeah, I decided not to go back to school.

27:57.942 --> 27:59.242
Just another hour anyway.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.811
Did you tell Amy?

28:00.878 --> 28:02.913
Did I tell Amy...

28:02.981 --> 28:04.414
About Adrian?

28:04.482 --> 28:06.583
Uh, what?

28:06.651 --> 28:09.553
Ben, I'd yell at you, but I feel so bad for you,

28:09.620 --> 28:10.620
I just can't yell.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.823
Did my dad tell you?

28:12.890 --> 28:15.158
You told me, you and Ricky.

28:15.226 --> 28:18.595
Security tapes. I watch the tapes every morning.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.963
Quite a scene today.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.032
Cute girl Ricky's seeing.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.567
Two of them violate any health code,

28:23.634 --> 28:24.868
someone's going to lose a job...

28:24.936 --> 28:26.470
and maybe an appendage.

28:26.537 --> 28:30.407
But just because you saw us
doesn't mean you heard us.

28:30.475 --> 28:31.541
Your dad's not a cheap man.

28:31.609 --> 28:32.943
It's a
state-of-the-art system.

28:33.011 --> 28:34.411
I heard everything.

28:34.479 --> 28:38.115
Sorry to say, even your
heart thump, thump, thumping.

28:38.182 --> 28:40.617
Okay.

28:40.685 --> 28:41.785
You made your point, and you know.

28:41.853 --> 28:46.623
So what should I do?

28:48.860 --> 28:50.494
Can't help you there.

28:50.561 --> 28:52.129
The only thing I can do is...

29:14.118 --> 29:15.886
Hey, thought I'd come home early.

29:15.953 --> 29:18.855
Thought you might need me.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.490
I made arroz con pollo.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.392
Thought we could have nice family dinner.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.861
So how did it go?

29:24.929 --> 29:26.663
Good.

29:26.731 --> 29:29.533
We had a nice, long talk, and she went to school.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.568
I'm glad she went to school.

29:31.636 --> 29:33.637
I hope she plans to stay in school.

29:33.704 --> 29:35.238
Amy set a good example for that.

29:35.306 --> 29:37.808
Okay, don't bring that up. Don't bring up Amy.

29:39.043 --> 29:42.913
And I don't think she's having the baby.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.514
What do you mean?

29:44.582 --> 29:46.216
The obvious.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.684
What?

29:47.752 --> 29:50.687
Ruben, I don't think Adrian wants to have a baby.

29:50.755 --> 29:53.156
Well, it's too late for
that. She is having a baby.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.292
Not unless she's going
forward with this pregnancy,

29:55.359 --> 29:56.927
which I don't think she's going to do.

29:56.994 --> 29:58.528
She's not going to have an abortion.

29:58.596 --> 30:01.398
She is if she wants to.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.667
No, she's not. We're not going to let her.

30:03.734 --> 30:04.901
I'm letting her.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.837
I'm not.

30:06.904 --> 30:08.138
We're not voting.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.440
It's her decision and whatever she decides.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.175
We're supporting her decision.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.710
I'm not.

30:13.778 --> 30:15.345
Then stay out of this.

30:15.413 --> 30:16.947
I'm her father.

30:17.014 --> 30:19.716
Okay, Ruben, I have a feeling...

30:19.784 --> 30:22.018
we're getting into a very dangerous territory,

30:22.086 --> 30:23.420
so why don't you step out of this...

30:23.488 --> 30:25.055
and leave this to me and my daughter?

30:25.123 --> 30:26.957
Because she's not just your daughter,

30:27.024 --> 30:28.425
and she's a child.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.728
A pregnant child? I don't think so. She's a woman.

30:31.796 --> 30:33.196
Yeah... a young woman,

30:33.264 --> 30:35.065
and she needs us to steer
her in the right direction.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.701
And you think you know
what the right direction is?

30:37.768 --> 30:41.304
I do. You want her to have a baby at 17.

30:41.372 --> 30:42.706
You did.

30:42.773 --> 30:44.641
Yeah, and where were you?

30:44.709 --> 30:46.943
I offered to marry you.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.045
"Offer." I hate that word "offer."

30:49.113 --> 30:50.380
What does that mean? Offer?

30:50.448 --> 30:51.715
I'll tell you what it means.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.383
I means you didn't want to marry me,

30:53.451 --> 30:54.818
which is why I didn't marry you,

30:54.886 --> 30:57.254
so you just took off and
had a baby with someone else.

30:57.321 --> 30:59.923
Yeah, well, I paid child support. As we agreed.

30:59.991 --> 31:02.559
As we agreed because that's what you wanted,

31:02.627 --> 31:03.760
to not marry me,

31:03.828 --> 31:05.729
to never see me again,

31:05.796 --> 31:06.830
to never let me see my daughter...

31:06.898 --> 31:08.231
yet still pay child support.

31:08.299 --> 31:10.100
And we did just fine without you.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.902
Oh, no you didn't,

31:11.969 --> 31:13.904
and you know how we know that?

31:13.971 --> 31:15.805
Adrian's pregnant.

31:21.179 --> 31:24.915
That's it. What do you think?

31:24.982 --> 31:29.452
It, uh, looks very safe.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.288
It is, and I own it out right...

31:31.355 --> 31:33.790
because I paid for it with
some money my dad left for me.

31:33.858 --> 31:36.726
I hope I can just keep it for the rest of my life.

31:36.794 --> 31:38.495
Oh, I don't know, Grace.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.464
It's nice, but no one keeps a car for life.

31:41.532 --> 31:43.767
Well, that's just the type of person I am.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.001
When I find something I love,

31:45.069 --> 31:47.571
I really hate to let go of it.

31:47.638 --> 31:49.039
For example, I love you,

31:49.106 --> 31:50.874
and I love our friendship,

31:50.942 --> 31:53.043
and I would really hate to let go of it,

31:53.110 --> 31:54.377
and I wouldn't let go of it...

31:54.445 --> 31:55.579
no matter what you do, Adrian.

31:55.646 --> 31:57.314
Grace, please... No, I mean it.

31:57.381 --> 32:00.350
I know you don't want to have a baby, but...

32:00.418 --> 32:01.952
I knew a but was coming,

32:02.019 --> 32:03.186
and I knew I should've have come out here...

32:03.254 --> 32:04.354
to see this stupid car.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.856
Adrian, you act all tough, but I know you.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.758
I know that deep down you
have a really big heart...

32:08.826 --> 32:10.660
and a good conscience...

32:10.728 --> 32:11.861
and you want to do the right thing.

32:11.929 --> 32:14.264
And what is the right thing?

32:14.332 --> 32:17.234
Is it right to go ahead with
something that was a mistake?

32:19.003 --> 32:20.103
Is it right to bring when
I don't want that baby...

32:20.171 --> 32:21.605
and Ben doesn't want that baby?

32:21.672 --> 32:23.673
Are we actually supposed to ruin two lives...

32:23.741 --> 32:24.975
just because a stupid condom broke...

32:25.042 --> 32:25.976
and my birth control failed?

32:26.043 --> 32:28.411
That's ridiculous, Grace,

32:28.479 --> 32:30.347
and I believe a baby is a baby...

32:30.414 --> 32:31.481
when the baby is born.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.516
Oh, and you know what else?

32:33.584 --> 32:34.884
If you wanted to do the right thing,

32:34.952 --> 32:36.686
you should've bought a hybrid.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.551
Hi.

32:45.320 --> 32:46.654
I just saw your parents.

32:46.688 --> 32:47.655
I said good-bye to them.

32:47.689 --> 32:48.990
Good. They really wanted to see you.

32:49.024 --> 32:51.692
Yeah, they really want to
see me again on the way out,

32:51.727 --> 32:54.128
so we probably shouldn't do anything.

32:54.162 --> 32:55.396
It might be kind of awkward.

32:55.430 --> 32:57.031
We'll see.

32:57.065 --> 32:59.166
So I just wanted to tell you something.

32:59.201 --> 33:01.035
Oh?

33:02.337 --> 33:04.171
I didn't do this right the first time,

33:04.206 --> 33:05.606
so I wanted to do it again.

33:05.641 --> 33:06.974
Jack, I just told you.

33:07.009 --> 33:09.477
I can't do anything. I have to go back out there.

33:09.511 --> 33:12.480
Madison, our relationship isn't just about sex.

33:12.514 --> 33:13.614
I love you.

33:13.649 --> 33:14.782
I really do.

33:14.816 --> 33:16.117
What did you get me? What did you get me?

33:16.151 --> 33:20.288
Madison, Madison, Madison.

33:20.322 --> 33:22.356
Oh, I'm sorry. I did it again.

33:22.391 --> 33:25.559
It's okay because this time
I did get you something.

33:28.563 --> 33:30.364
It's the necklace my stepfather gave my mother...

33:30.399 --> 33:31.932
the first time he told her he loved her.

33:31.967 --> 33:33.534
Huh.

33:33.568 --> 33:35.002
Do you like it?

33:35.037 --> 33:36.437
I love it.

33:36.471 --> 33:38.572
What is it?

33:38.607 --> 33:41.242
I mean, it looks like some kind of bird?

33:41.276 --> 33:42.743
It's a seagull.

33:42.778 --> 33:44.378
Oh, it's a seagull.

33:44.413 --> 33:47.348
Kind of looks like an albatross.

33:47.382 --> 33:49.216
I think that's kind of a bad-luck bird.

33:49.251 --> 33:50.484
No, it's a seagull.

33:50.519 --> 33:52.653
I swear. My mom told me, and she would know.

33:52.688 --> 33:54.121
She's been wearing it for, like, a decade.

33:54.156 --> 33:55.489
Wow.

33:55.524 --> 33:57.425
Well, if she's had it that long,

33:57.459 --> 34:00.094
then maybe she should keep it.

34:00.128 --> 34:01.762
No, she wants you to have it.

34:01.797 --> 34:03.764
Then when people ask you where you got it from,

34:03.799 --> 34:04.932
you can tell them you got it from me...

34:04.966 --> 34:07.401
the second time I told you I love you.

34:07.436 --> 34:10.971
But it's just so special, you know?

34:11.005 --> 34:13.040
I'm almost afraid to wear it.

34:13.074 --> 34:15.009
I mean, it's practically an heirloom.

34:15.043 --> 34:16.143
It means so much to your mother,

34:16.178 --> 34:17.678
and if something happened to it,

34:17.713 --> 34:18.913
I'd just die.

34:18.947 --> 34:20.313
Nothing's going to happen to it.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.216
She never took it off, so...

34:22.250 --> 34:25.985
Wow. Really? Never. Never.

34:26.021 --> 34:27.521
Oh. Okay.

34:27.556 --> 34:31.058
Well, I guess I'll put it on
and never take it off then.

34:31.092 --> 34:33.761
Here, let me help you. Okay.

34:45.940 --> 34:48.609
So how was your night last night?

34:48.643 --> 34:50.511
My night? What do you mean?

34:50.545 --> 34:52.012
I mean, how was Zoe?

34:52.047 --> 34:54.047
That's none of your business.

34:54.949 --> 34:56.884
No judgment. Just asking.

34:59.221 --> 35:01.989
If you have no judgment, why are you asking?

35:02.023 --> 35:03.591
How did you find out about that anyway?

35:03.625 --> 35:06.260
How did I find out?

35:06.294 --> 35:07.728
Everyone at school knows.

35:07.763 --> 35:09.497
Zoe told everyone.

35:09.531 --> 35:10.731
She wanted everyone to know.

35:10.766 --> 35:12.032
It's nobody's business.

35:12.067 --> 35:13.234
You shouldn't listen to that stuff.

35:13.268 --> 35:14.802
Well, why aren't y telling me that stuff?

35:14.836 --> 35:16.036
We're friends, aren't we?

35:16.071 --> 35:17.538
Yeah, we're friends,

35:17.572 --> 35:19.607
but we're not going to talk about that stuff.

35:19.641 --> 35:21.242
We used to talk about that stuff.

35:21.276 --> 35:22.810
Well, we're not now.

35:22.844 --> 35:23.911
Why not?

35:23.945 --> 35:25.146
You know why.

35:25.180 --> 35:26.580
No, I don't know why.

35:26.615 --> 35:29.316
Hey, you're the one who
suggested I go out and have...

35:29.351 --> 35:30.751
how did you put it?

35:30.786 --> 35:33.154
Indiscriminate, meaningless sex.

35:33.188 --> 35:35.656
Yeah, but you didn't have
to if you didn't want to.

35:35.690 --> 35:40.594
Oh, jeez, you're jealous.

35:40.629 --> 35:42.830
Jealousy's not a good feeling, is it?

35:42.864 --> 35:44.832
No, it's really not.

35:47.235 --> 35:49.336
Oh, look who's here. Hi.

35:49.371 --> 35:50.404
Hi.

35:50.439 --> 35:51.605
Hey.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.474
Yeah.

35:53.508 --> 35:54.775
So...

35:54.810 --> 35:57.278
So?

35:57.312 --> 35:59.613
So he's going to be living
here for the next month?

35:59.648 --> 36:01.449
Yeah, but he has nothing to do with us.

36:01.483 --> 36:03.617
I said I'll give you a shot,
so I'll give you a shot.

36:03.652 --> 36:06.687
Why the sudden change, if
you don't mind my asking?

36:09.224 --> 36:11.625
Never mind. I don't care.

36:15.230 --> 36:16.430
Ames?

36:16.465 --> 36:18.466
Hey, I just want to let
you know that I got here...

36:18.500 --> 36:21.168
without a single, solitary problem, all on my own.

36:21.203 --> 36:24.071
<i>I met this really nice taxi driver Rajisan.</i>

36:24.105 --> 36:25.172
He has three sons.

36:25.207 --> 36:26.841
How's John?

36:26.875 --> 36:28.309
Don't talk to taxi drivers.

36:28.343 --> 36:30.044
Just give them the address, and that's it.

36:30.078 --> 36:32.112
John's fine. Ricky's putting him to bed,

36:32.147 --> 36:34.014
and your mother's putting Robbie down.

36:34.049 --> 36:35.549
How's the dorm? How's the roommate?

36:35.584 --> 36:37.151
It's not like a dorm room at all.

36:37.185 --> 36:39.520
It's like it's my first apartment.

36:39.554 --> 36:41.322
<i>I don't have a roommate. What?</i>

36:41.356 --> 36:42.890
Yeah, it's really an apartment.

36:42.924 --> 36:45.092
It's got, like, a kitchen
and a bathroom and everything,

36:45.126 --> 36:46.393
and it's all mine.

36:46.428 --> 36:47.595
But it's a dorm room.

36:47.629 --> 36:48.963
There are other girls in the building, right?

36:48.997 --> 36:51.332
I guess, but, Dad, it's an apartment.

36:51.366 --> 36:53.467
It's what they call a studio apartment,

36:53.502 --> 36:56.670
but it's an apartment.

36:56.705 --> 36:59.540
I can't believe I have my
own apartment in New York.

36:59.574 --> 37:01.375
Dorm room.

37:01.409 --> 37:03.744
Well, I'm glad you got there okay.

37:03.778 --> 37:04.879
Did you lock the door?

37:04.913 --> 37:08.082
Uh, yeah, I locked the door.

37:08.116 --> 37:09.617
I love you, sweetie.

37:09.651 --> 37:11.519
I love you, too.

37:11.553 --> 37:13.554
Thanks for letting me do this.

37:13.588 --> 37:15.489
Thank you so much.

37:15.524 --> 37:16.857
Can't wait to get out there tomorrow...

37:16.892 --> 37:19.226
and see the city and my school and everything.

37:19.261 --> 37:20.628
It's like a whole new life for me.

37:20.662 --> 37:22.997
Well, don't forget it's a four week life.

37:23.031 --> 37:25.165
We'll need you back here
after four weeks. All right?

37:25.200 --> 37:26.600
All right. Love you.

37:26.635 --> 37:27.601
Love you.

37:27.636 --> 37:29.270
Good night.

37:47.155 --> 37:48.155
Hi.

37:48.189 --> 37:50.491
Hi.

37:50.525 --> 37:51.458
Waiting for me?

37:51.493 --> 37:53.260
We were both waiting for you.

37:53.295 --> 37:55.062
Where have you been? Mom made dinner.

37:55.096 --> 37:57.331
It's our first night as a family in this house.

37:57.365 --> 38:00.200
Your mother and I had an argument.

38:00.235 --> 38:02.102
I know that. She told me.

38:02.137 --> 38:04.238
She also told me what it's about.

38:04.272 --> 38:07.207
Sit down, Adrian.

38:07.242 --> 38:09.276
Let's both sit.

38:12.380 --> 38:14.214
I want to talk to you,

38:14.249 --> 38:15.683
and I don't want to argue.

38:15.717 --> 38:18.218
This is not an argument.

38:18.253 --> 38:21.522
It's okay if you and your mother
talked without me this morning.

38:21.556 --> 38:23.958
I wanted you two to talk without me,

38:23.992 --> 38:26.126
but I do have an opinion about this,

38:26.161 --> 38:29.063
about you, about the baby.

38:29.097 --> 38:30.598
I don't want to have a baby.

38:30.632 --> 38:33.200
But, Adrian, you are having a baby.

38:33.234 --> 38:34.702
You can't decide that.

38:34.736 --> 38:37.771
Look, I'm your father,

38:37.806 --> 38:39.873
and you have to have some respect for me,

38:39.908 --> 38:41.375
whether you agree with my opinion or not.

38:41.409 --> 38:44.478
I respectfully disagree with your opinion,

38:44.512 --> 38:46.246
and I didn't ask for your opinion.

38:46.281 --> 38:48.148
I don't care if you didn't ask for my opinion.

38:48.183 --> 38:52.620
You're my daughter, and I don't
want you to terminate the pregnancy.

38:52.654 --> 38:55.356
In fact, I'm not going to let
you terminate the pregnancy.

38:55.390 --> 38:58.692
How's that going to work?
How are you going to stop me?

38:58.727 --> 39:01.629
By convincing you that
you're doing the wrong thing.

39:01.663 --> 39:04.064
In your opinion, which is based on what?

39:04.099 --> 39:07.234
I was raised in the Catholic Church.

39:07.268 --> 39:09.803
You've been married three times.

39:09.838 --> 39:12.239
You're on your fourth. How Catholic is that?

39:12.273 --> 39:15.042
One of those was an annulment.

39:15.076 --> 39:16.076
Whatever.

39:16.111 --> 39:18.145
Look, in every case,

39:18.179 --> 39:19.780
both parties were adults,

39:19.814 --> 39:21.682
and you're not an adult.

39:21.716 --> 39:23.951
You meant me, right?

39:23.985 --> 39:27.888
I'm an adult. I may not be 18, but I'm an adult.

39:27.922 --> 39:32.226
No, you're not, but I am.

39:32.260 --> 39:34.495
So is my mother.

39:34.529 --> 39:35.796
She's an adult,

39:35.830 --> 39:38.465
and she's totally supportive
of whatever I want to do.

39:39.467 --> 39:41.869
Well, Adrian,

39:41.903 --> 39:44.405
then maybe we really shouldn't be a family...

39:44.439 --> 39:46.473
because this is a fundamental difference...

39:46.508 --> 39:48.142
between your mother and me...

39:48.176 --> 39:51.812
that we never realized we had until now,

39:51.846 --> 39:56.917
and now I don't know if we can get past this.

40:06.428 --> 40:10.130
<i>You've arrived at your destination.</i>

40:10.165 --> 40:13.200
Yes, I have.

40:14.536 --> 40:16.203
Adrian.

40:19.774 --> 40:21.709
Hello.

40:22.844 --> 40:25.813
Hi, Tom. Why are you all dressed up?

40:25.847 --> 40:29.583
It is a very speeial night, my love.

40:29.617 --> 40:31.785
Oh, no.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.721
How are you this fine evening?

40:33.755 --> 40:35.989
It's not a fine evening for me, Tom.

40:36.024 --> 40:37.191
You should just go home.

40:37.225 --> 40:41.662
I know something that could make it a lot better.

40:41.696 --> 40:43.630
And what would that be?

40:44.833 --> 40:46.700
Here, hold my hat...

40:46.735 --> 40:48.335
and my cane.

40:54.042 --> 40:56.276
<i>*...</i>

40:57.312 --> 41:01.148
You are so beautiful, Adrian.

41:01.182 --> 41:04.351
I want to take care of you...

41:04.385 --> 41:07.621
for the rest of my life.

41:07.655 --> 41:09.923
Will you marry me?

41:09.958 --> 41:11.725
No, Tom.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.460
You can think about it.

41:24.806 --> 41:27.674
