WEBVTT

00:03.903 --> 00:04.892
Good morning, Ben.

00:05.872 --> 00:06.930
Sorry.
Sorry.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.235
Did I scare you?
No.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.799
I just wanted to remind you of the
art show that's happening tonight

00:10.877 --> 00:12.242
at the community center.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.044
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.579
Great. Well,
that sounds cool.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.947
That sounds like something that
will be a big success. You know?

00:19.019 --> 00:23.319
I mean, like everything
that you put your paws on.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.448
Your fingers.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.622
Leslie Knope!
Ben Wyatt. Ben, great news.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.417
Do you remember
the woman I told you about

00:29.562 --> 00:31.052
from the county
commissioner's office?

00:31.164 --> 00:32.323
Um... Vaguely.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.625
Sure you do. Cindy Miller.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.691
Anyway, she's agreed to go out
on a date with you.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.895
Oh.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.234
You asked her out for me?

00:39.372 --> 00:43.103
You're going to love her.
She is interesting, smart and beautiful.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.404
Inside and out.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.968
Inner beauty is
very important.

00:47.113 --> 00:49.638
And outer beauty is
also very important.

00:50.417 --> 00:53.648
I thought you had a rule about
inter-government relationships.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.746
Don't worry. Her department is
completely separate from ours.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.087
This isn't anything like your
affair with Tom Haverford.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.525
We weren't... You... You...

01:01.661 --> 01:03.026
I'm sorry,
who are you calling?

01:03.096 --> 01:04.084
<i>Cindy Miller.</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:05.254
Cindy Miller. Chris Traeger.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.194
Guess who is standing in
this room with me right now.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.766
<i>Oh, uh...</i>
Ben Wyatt.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.100
Ben, say hello.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.035
Hi, Cindy. Sorry.

01:14.107 --> 01:18.373
<i>Hi. No apology necessary.</i>
<i>It's just Chris being Chris.</i>

01:22.615 --> 01:23.639
How are you doing?

01:23.783 --> 01:24.841
Ooh! Sparks are flying!

01:25.185 --> 01:28.086
We may have to call the fire department.
It's a government joke.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.780
<i>I love setting people up.</i>

01:30.156 --> 01:33.592
Here's my secret.
I determine someone's best qualities,

01:33.793 --> 01:38.025
and then, I find someone else
with compatible qualities,

01:41.367 --> 01:42.664
and I bring them together.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

02:03.223 --> 02:04.485
(GROANS)

02:04.557 --> 02:06.149
God, this sucks.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.625
Why don't you just go home
for the rest of the day?

02:08.695 --> 02:10.219
I can't go home,
because I have this

02:10.363 --> 02:11.887
art show opening at
the community center,

02:11.965 --> 02:14.058
and I can't stay
here because I see Ben,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.932
and I can't date Ben because
of Chris <i>'</i> stupid rules.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.936
I feel so...

02:19.339 --> 02:20.704
Powerless.
Yeah.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.204
I'm like that light bulb.

02:23.276 --> 02:26.336
Weak, flickering,
barely giving off any light,

02:26.513 --> 02:30.074
unable to make out with the light
bulb I want to make out with.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.783
You know what might
make you feel better?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.210
A hug?

02:33.586 --> 02:36.146
Paxil. Do you want me
to get you a prescription?

02:36.222 --> 02:37.211
(GROANS)

02:38.625 --> 02:40.456
Hey, Tom! A question for you.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.427
Do you know anyone
who's looking for a roommate?

02:42.795 --> 02:43.819
How hot?

02:43.963 --> 02:44.987
I... What?

02:45.298 --> 02:47.766
How hot is the woman that's
looking for a place to stay?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.802
No, it's me. I'm looking.
Come on. That's not fair.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.928
You shouldn't have led me to
believe it was a beautiful woman.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.267
I didn't.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.567
I've been staying at the Pawnee
Super Suites Motel for seven months.

02:57.710 --> 03:01.612
It's a charming little inn with
wonderfully random wake-up calls,

03:01.781 --> 03:04.079
delightfully
unstable temperatures,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.778
and, as of yesterday, bedbugs.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.850
"Four stars," says nobody.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.221
I wish I could help you, Benihana,
but I can't. I have a one-bedroom.

03:13.426 --> 03:14.916
I can't have a dude
sleeping on my couch

03:15.061 --> 03:16.585
if and when I
bring home a lady.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.527
I have a ritual,
and it starts on the couch.

03:19.165 --> 03:20.860
We sit down,
clap my hands, lights dim.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.729
Okay. I understand.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.666
Boyz II Men. Fades in.
Please, stop. No.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.602
No, you don't need to
explain the ritual. I'm good.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.139
You know who might
be able to help out

03:29.275 --> 03:30.674
a homeless dude
such as yourself?

03:31.077 --> 03:32.635
This is awesomely perfect.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.475
Burly just moved in
with his rich girlfriend,

03:34.614 --> 03:36.411
and we need
help with the rent.

03:36.482 --> 03:37.915
We have a couple of
house rules, though.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.178
Yeah, sure. Of course.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.412
You can't use the front door.

03:40.486 --> 03:41.885
You have to climb in
through the back window.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.684
No personal
phone conversations.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.282
If you ever speak to me in Spanish,
please use the formal <i>"usted".</i>

03:47.360 --> 03:49.624
And no
electricity after 6:00 p.m.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.625
She's joking.
Okay.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.166
You can use as much
free electricity as you want.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.927
It's free.
Couple more rules.

03:56.269 --> 03:57.998
If you ever watch a sad movie,

03:58.137 --> 03:59.536
you have to wear
mascara so we can see

03:59.672 --> 04:01.071
whether or not
you've been crying.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.576
There's no noise allowed on Mondays,
and no TV after breakfast.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.034
She is lying again.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.102
She is.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.341
Yes.
Because it's hard to tell.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.110
No. We leave
the TV on all day long

04:11.184 --> 04:12.845
so burglars think that
we're home when we're not,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.410
which was my idea that
I'm trying to patent.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.653
So, you want to
move in tonight?

04:22.195 --> 04:24.129
Yeah. Sure.
That would be great.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.391
You want my gum?
Uh-huh.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.237
Ron, can you make
the opening remarks?

04:33.373 --> 04:35.841
I'm just...
I'm not in the mood.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.838
Neither am I. Ever.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.172
What's wrong with you?
You live for this kind of stuff.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.711
I don't have it
in me right now.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.273
Ron, please. Do it for me.
Make the speech. Ron, please. Please.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.850
Give the speech, Ron.
No.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.784
Yes. Please? Ron? Please.
No.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.515
Please give the speech.
Please give the speech.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.920
No. I won't. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.515
No way.
Please, please, please, please, please.

04:53.593 --> 04:54.651
No. Please, please.
Yes, yes...

04:54.727 --> 04:56.752
All right! Damn it, woman.

04:57.096 --> 05:01.829
Okay, everyone.
Shut up and look at me!

05:02.568 --> 05:04.661
Welcome to
"Visions of Nature."

05:04.804 --> 05:06.931
This room has
several paintings in it.

05:07.006 --> 05:11.340
Some are big. Some are small.
People did them, and they are here now.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.844
I believe that
after this is over,

05:12.979 --> 05:14.412
they'll be hung in
government buildings.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.280
Why the government is involved
in an art show is beyond me.

05:18.351 --> 05:22.344
I also think it's pointless for
a human to paint scenes of nature

05:22.422 --> 05:24.788
when they can just go outside
and stand in it.

05:25.391 --> 05:28.588
Anyway, please do not misinterpret
the fact that I am talking right now

05:28.661 --> 05:33.428
as genuine interest in art and
attempt to discuss it with me further.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.932
End of speech.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.530
ANDY: And that's the TV room.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.902
Oh, my God.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.904
ANDY: Yeah, it's a mess.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.948
Can you throw that
in the trash can?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.782
I was just here, like,
three weeks ago for your wedding.

05:54.854 --> 05:55.980
What happened?

05:56.122 --> 05:57.282
Well, Burly moved out.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.292
He was the one that did all the
cleaning and throwing away and stuff.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.950
Wait, he moved out,
like, a week ago.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.585
You guys made
this mess in a week?

06:03.696 --> 06:05.561
Well, I always think
April's going to clean up.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.292
And I never clean up.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.391
It's cute, right?

06:08.668 --> 06:09.657
No.

06:09.736 --> 06:10.760
Yes, it is.

06:12.438 --> 06:15.703
Are you guys frying marbles?

06:16.075 --> 06:17.736
We were checking to see
if the fire alarm worked.

06:17.810 --> 06:18.834
It doesn't.

06:18.911 --> 06:23.678
ANDY: <i>The biggest challenge to
picking the perfect roommate is</i>

06:23.916 --> 06:26.510
finding someone
who's willing to pay more

06:26.652 --> 06:29.280
than their share of
rent without knowing it.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.786
I think we found that in Ben.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.462
You forgot to
paint a painting, son.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.232
So, for my painting,
I chose one

06:41.367 --> 06:43.267
of my very
favorite Greek myths,

06:43.569 --> 06:47.198
the centaur goddess, Dyaphena,
slaying a great stag.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.531
(CLEARS THROAT)
It's stunning.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.800
It's breathtaking, Jerry.

06:50.943 --> 06:52.001
Yeah. It really is.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.872
Wow. Thanks, guys.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.971
Hey, Leslie,
you should really come

06:56.115 --> 06:58.140
over here and look
at Jerry's painting.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.411
Oh, my God.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.519
That's me.
Is that me?

07:03.790 --> 07:05.758
What? No.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.793
Geez, it does
look like you.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.294
LESLIE: You're just
realizing that now?

07:11.364 --> 07:13.628
That's what you see when you
close your eyes at night, Jerry.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.166
Topless Leslie
glued to a horse.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.258
(LAUGHS)

07:16.335 --> 07:18.929
Okay. Leslie,
I am just so, so sorry.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.737
Dyaphena,
she is this powerful goddess,

07:21.808 --> 07:23.867
and I've been thinking a lot
about powerful women,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.377
and subconsciously,
I painted you.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.309
I'm sorry. I'm going
to take it right down.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.279
No. Leave it up.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.516
I love it.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.476
I don't know
how to explain it.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.989
Every time I look at it,
I just think to myself,

07:38.124 --> 07:40.592
"What can't that
centaur woman do?

07:40.726 --> 07:43.058
"Besides ride
an escalator and drive a car."

07:43.129 --> 07:48.157
Art can be so magnificent.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.033
Oh, my God.
The baby is Tom.

07:50.169 --> 07:51.568
What?

07:52.238 --> 07:54.672
This is easily my
favorite painting ever.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.506
What the hell, Jerry? Look at my pot
belly. I look like a pregnant baby.

07:58.878 --> 08:01.369
And why am I so scared? All right,
we've got to take this down. Now.

08:01.447 --> 08:02.937
No, this painting
isn't going anywhere, Tom.

08:03.115 --> 08:07.017
It's staying right here.
Hello, fellow lover of the arts.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.081
Welcome to the painting.

08:09.589 --> 08:10.613
What, is that you?

08:12.291 --> 08:13.315
Well, it's hot.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.220
Thank you.

08:15.294 --> 08:18.457
This guy's in it, too.
He's the little fat baby.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.187
Cool.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.255
Yeah.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.930
What's going on right here?

08:24.070 --> 08:25.799
Baby rolls!

08:29.876 --> 08:32.400
We've been trying to get
that light fixed for months.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.534
Thank you.

08:33.645 --> 08:34.840
Thank her.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.208
Good morning, Tom.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.078
She marched into my office this
morning and told me she wouldn't leave

08:39.184 --> 08:40.515
until I got this done.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.610
Hmm.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.746
Well, I'm glad
someone's feeling good.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.815
They're going to hang that
painting in a public building

08:46.926 --> 08:48.257
where anybody can see it.

08:48.628 --> 08:52.223
In one brush stroke,
Jerry has killed the Jay-Z vibe

08:52.298 --> 08:53.663
that's taken me
years to cultivate

08:53.733 --> 08:56.133
and replaced it with the fat,
brown baby vibe,

08:56.302 --> 08:58.031
which is not as
cool of a vibe.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.595
Hey, Aphrodite. Chris
needs you in his office.

09:00.673 --> 09:01.662
Hmm.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.133
When you're done with the light,
fix the printer.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.574
I don't know how
to fix printers.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.008
Learn it.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.205
Leslie, should I go, too?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.946
This isn't about you, Jerry.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.143
It's my painting.

09:15.454 --> 09:16.751
Why am I upset?

09:16.822 --> 09:20.189
Let's start with
government-funded animal porn.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.022
I'm not sure
that's fair.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.756
I want it destroyed,
and I want a statement from this office

09:24.830 --> 09:28.630
apologizing for an obscene
depiction of bestiality.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.394
Bestiality? It is
a picture of a centaur,

09:31.671 --> 09:33.696
a beautiful half person,
half horse.

09:33.773 --> 09:35.365
And how did it
get like that?

09:35.474 --> 09:39.342
Who had sex with what
and gave birth to which?

09:39.512 --> 09:42.447
Ms. Langman, we hear you,
we understand you

09:42.548 --> 09:46.314
and we are going to do whatever
we can to come to a solution.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.917
Destroy it.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.453
Destroy it?
I mean, is she serious?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.889
Do you find this
personally offensive?

09:54.460 --> 09:55.791
Not personally, no.

09:55.995 --> 09:59.522
No, personally, I enjoy a good
artistic depiction of the human form.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.997
I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
I've posed nude.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.162
In college,
I was in a nude production of <i>Cats.</i>

10:05.771 --> 10:07.295
But I am not in
the nude now, am I?

10:07.506 --> 10:08.871
Because we're in
a government building.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.909
And that would
be inappropriate,

10:11.043 --> 10:13.011
which is what I
think Marcia is saying.

10:13.312 --> 10:14.939
So, take care of
this situation.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.515
<i>That painting is not</i>
<i>going to be destroyed.</i>

10:17.583 --> 10:19.983
Every great work of
art contains a message.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.350
And the message of
this painting is,

10:22.421 --> 10:27.882
"Get out of my way unless you want
an arrow in your ass, Marcia."

10:28.894 --> 10:30.919
Morning, roomie.
How did you sleep?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.589
Well, there were
no bedbugs.

10:32.665 --> 10:36.032
Also, no bed.
I'm going to go buy a bed.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.732
Fork.
I'm sorry.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.931
Are you eating turkey
chili off of a frisbee?

10:41.941 --> 10:44.375
(LAUGHING) Yeah. It's
pretty cute, right?

10:44.944 --> 10:47.378
No. Do you know
what "cute" means?

10:47.446 --> 10:49.414
What have you got against
turkey chili for breakfast?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.007
What have you guys got
against washing dishes?

10:52.084 --> 10:54.052
We don't have
any dishes, okay?

10:54.120 --> 10:55.849
Burly took them
all when he left.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.751
Now, I bet you
feel like a jerk.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.652
God. Okay, I might need to not
stay here anymore.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.927
No. Sorry, dude. We already spent
your money on a new Xbox 360

11:03.996 --> 11:05.361
and more
frisbees to eat off of.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.728
You've got to stay.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.197
God. Okay. All right.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.561
Here's the deal.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.203
We're going to
clean this place up.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.600
Okay? And then, I am going to
teach you how to be adults.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.605
Cool. We'll get to be adults.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.070
Gee, golly.
Thanks, mister.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.175
Fork.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.416
Hello. I'm Perd Hapley,
and welcome to <i>Ya' Heard? With Perd.</i>

11:29.488 --> 11:32.719
Today's show begins now.
Is this art

11:32.792 --> 11:34.623
or is it pornography?

11:34.694 --> 11:35.991
Here to answer this question

11:36.062 --> 11:38.530
is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director,
Leslie Knope.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.155
Perd, it is
a beautiful work of art.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.360
Governments should not be
in the business of censorship,

11:43.569 --> 11:46.163
especially when a painting is
as awesome as this one.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.364
But this is
where the controversy

11:48.507 --> 11:50.600
of this story gets
even more controversial.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.178
You are the subject
of this painting.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.576
Half woman,
half horse, with what

11:55.715 --> 11:57.979
some would say
are human breasts.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.914
I am not the subject.

12:00.086 --> 12:04.489
The subject is strong and
empowered women everywhere.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.655
But it does look
a little bit like me.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.752
Leslie,
for our viewers at home

12:09.895 --> 12:11.920
who might not know,
are centaurs real?

12:12.498 --> 12:13.487
No.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.699
Absolutely sure?

12:15.768 --> 12:18.931
Okay. So, you always separate
your lights from your darks.

12:19.004 --> 12:20.028
That's racist.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.605
And then,
you get your laundry...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.208
Where is your
laundry detergent?

12:23.275 --> 12:25.004
Right. Here we are.

12:25.211 --> 12:29.238
Okay. This is
bubble bath. You guys...

12:29.448 --> 12:31.075
You wash your
clothes in bubble bath?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.411
Bubble bath,
clothes soap, same thing.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.919
No, it's not.

12:34.987 --> 12:37.148
Well, they both
make bubbles, so...

12:38.491 --> 12:41.153
LESLIE: It was never our
intention to offend anyone

12:41.227 --> 12:45.220
I guess some people object to
powerful depictions of awesome ladies.

12:45.364 --> 12:46.353
Okay.

12:46.565 --> 12:49.398
Also joining us today
is a different person.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.698
Pornographic film actress,
Brandi Maxxxx.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.231
Pleasure to be here.
Brandi, you've starred in

12:54.306 --> 12:57.537
over 200 adult films,
some of which are very good.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.302
When did you get into the business?
Last year.

12:59.411 --> 13:04.474
Fantastic. Now, this painting
right here, art or pornography?

13:04.650 --> 13:06.811
Perd, I think this
whole debate is ridiculous.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.216
What Leslie and I
do is obviously art.

13:10.156 --> 13:12.386
Hang on.
There is a big difference

13:12.458 --> 13:16.724
between an oil painting of a Greek
myth and a pornographic movie.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.456
It's okay, Leslie.
I got this one. What?

13:18.531 --> 13:21.557
What Leslie and I want people to know
is you should be able to have sex

13:21.634 --> 13:24.034
anywhere you want
and show it anywhere you want.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.069
Whether it's girl-on-girl
action, bondage, or...

13:27.173 --> 13:28.470
Yep.
...what have you.

13:28.541 --> 13:32.136
Okay. Hang on.
Pornography is very difficult to define.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.802
In fact, it was Justice
Stewart who once said,

13:34.880 --> 13:37.508
"I can't define pornography,
but I know it when I see it."

13:37.583 --> 13:39.346
Brandi, how would
you define pornography?

13:39.985 --> 13:42.510
For me, it's when
the penis goes in.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.986
All right, we need to do
some basic organization.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.888
Where do you put your
bills when they come?

13:52.198 --> 13:55.599
I read the magazines
and give the rest to Andy.

13:55.801 --> 14:00.568
Which I organize into a pile or
stack that I put into the freezer.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.466
Why?

14:02.608 --> 14:03.768
So they won't get lost.

14:06.378 --> 14:07.538
ANDY: Bingo.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.015
Okay, you have
to pay these.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.049
Good thing
I didn't lose them.

14:16.121 --> 14:19.750
Okay. New lesson.
Basic finance.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.792
I'm gonna teach you
how to balance a checkbook.

14:24.330 --> 14:28.289
Okay. I am going to teach you
how to open a bank account.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.437
Bank account. Good.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.396
Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford.

14:34.473 --> 14:35.701
I just wanted to
say I thought you made

14:35.841 --> 14:37.103
some excellent
points up there.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.003
I totally agree with
you that people should

14:39.144 --> 14:40.805
be allowed to have
sex in public places.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.946
You look familiar to me.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.776
Maybe you've seen me
down at the Snakehole Lounge.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.284
I'm a part-owner there.

14:47.419 --> 14:48.852
That's you. In the painting.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.988
You're the fat baby.
(SCOFFS)

14:51.056 --> 14:52.182
Aw!

14:52.258 --> 14:53.748
That's so cute.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.417
Oh. You're into that?

14:55.694 --> 14:56.786
No.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.452
Damn it, Jerry.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.396
Imagine my horror.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.401
I'm hanging upside down with
my gravity boots watching Perd.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.769
I see you with your painting,
and I am startled and disappointed.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.132
Well, I did not know that
Brandi was going to offer me

15:10.209 --> 15:11.506
a role in her next film.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.440
I urge you not
to take that role.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.002
I am not going
to take the role.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.138
That's good to hear,

15:16.215 --> 15:19.616
because recently,
you've been a little unpredictable.

15:19.852 --> 15:23.379
I'm sorry that I'm trying to
defend a beautiful work of art.

15:23.489 --> 15:24.615
Thank you, Leslie.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.917
Stand down, Jerry.
This isn't your fight.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.686
You've left me no choice.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.088
I have convened a meeting
of the Public Arts Commission,

15:30.162 --> 15:31.925
and we will abide
by their decision.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.765
Fine with me.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.464
Public Arts Commission.
Filled with hippies

15:36.602 --> 15:38.900
who love art and
sometimes weed.

15:39.471 --> 15:40.870
Jackpot.
