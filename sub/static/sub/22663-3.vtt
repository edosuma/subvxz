Documents.

01:37.890 --> 01:41.650
SOFIA, BULGARIA

03:45.770 --> 03:47.250
Dad, the truck is there.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.970
Yes.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.730
Yes, Dad.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.210
Understood.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.330
I'll call you when I'm done.

04:25.410 --> 04:29.130
- Is this 22,500 euros?
- Yes, 1500 per person.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.850
I want 500 extra per person.

04:32.970 --> 04:36.210
- They don't have that.
- I don't care.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.970
Those who don't pay stay in the container.
Tell 'em that.

04:44.850 --> 04:47.450
- Everything alright?
- I think so.

05:01.490 --> 05:06.330
What the hell are you doing?
Italian bastard.

05:06.450 --> 05:09.250
- They've already paid.
- Is that so?

05:12.170 --> 05:16.570
I decide who paid and who didn't.

05:16.690 --> 05:18.090
Understood?

05:19.850 --> 05:22.330
Now, clean up this mess.

05:23.850 --> 05:26.250
Son, wake up.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.170
Speak to me, son.

06:20.370 --> 06:21.770
A little further.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.050
Bags.

06:26.330 --> 06:27.970
Stop.

06:37.650 --> 06:39.090
Up.

06:39.210 --> 06:41.090
A little more.

06:56.010 --> 06:57.490
Just a little more. Stop.

07:43.010 --> 07:47.010
Translated by: NederSubs

08:20.970 --> 08:24.930
Come on, you have to play
and fight with him.

08:25.050 --> 08:27.130
Yes, like that,
throw him down. Bravo.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.730
Start again.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.250
Go.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.090
One more time, come on.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.450
This is shit. Start again.

08:45.010 --> 08:46.570
Hello, Ciro.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.850
Get up.

08:52.610 --> 08:54.690
My son has complained about you.

08:54.810 --> 08:57.210
- Again.
- Sorry.

08:59.970 --> 09:03.170
I'm scared of men without passion.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.770
You don't seem to get excited
about anything.

09:07.930 --> 09:11.250
The thing I liked is gone, Valentin.

09:12.210 --> 09:16.370
I'm okay with you.
I listen to you...

09:16.490 --> 09:19.570
and I don't have time
to think about other things.

09:21.810 --> 09:25.130
My son wants you
to take over the houses in Lyulin.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.370
Is that a problem for you?

09:28.490 --> 09:30.970
No, no problem.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.090
Never stand up to him.

09:41.170 --> 09:42.570
Okay.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.450
You can go.

09:52.930 --> 09:57.850
Go on, boys.
I want to see a nice attack. Like that.

10:15.450 --> 10:16.850
Come with me.

10:47.650 --> 10:51.290
Clear 7 and 15.

11:50.570 --> 11:51.970
Good morning.

12:09.850 --> 12:12.570
You have to leave here.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.570
Please, my husband is sick.

12:15.690 --> 12:19.210
He just got home from the hospital,
he is dying.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.090
Pack your things and leave.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.690
- Take this.
- Get out.

12:52.810 --> 12:56.050
- Take it.
- Don't you understand me?

12:56.170 --> 12:57.690
You don't understand.

12:57.810 --> 13:01.810
- We can't go anywhere.
- You don't understand.

13:01.930 --> 13:04.890
Don't you understand?
You have to leave here.

13:06.330 --> 13:11.290
Leave, or I'll kill you myself.

13:16.370 --> 13:19.530
You have five minutes. Five minutes.

13:39.730 --> 13:44.170
Step out and get your passport.
Get out.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.930
- Faster.
- Passports.

13:47.050 --> 13:49.530
- Hurry.
- Have your passport ready.

13:50.970 --> 13:53.970
- Passport.
- Come on, hurry.

13:55.850 --> 13:57.650
Move it.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.610
Quickly.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.010
Passport.

14:07.490 --> 14:08.890
Go on.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.010
Walk.

14:52.210 --> 14:54.770
Put your stuff down here.

15:06.970 --> 15:08.930
This is the kitchen.

15:12.410 --> 15:15.690
We'll bring you groceries.

15:15.810 --> 15:20.490
You can't go to the store yourself,
and you can't leave here.

15:23.050 --> 15:24.930
Understood?

15:25.050 --> 15:30.330
Got it? You cannot go outside.
I'm in charge here.

15:30.450 --> 15:32.490
Can I call home?

15:34.370 --> 15:36.530
To Albania.

15:36.650 --> 15:37.650
Please?

15:38.930 --> 15:40.730
I don't understand your language.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.770
Phone.

15:43.890 --> 15:46.490
- Phone, please.
- No.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.090
- Please.
- I don't understand you.

15:49.210 --> 15:52.730
- No phone calls.
- Please.

15:52.850 --> 15:56.050
- Please be kind.
- No phone calls.

15:56.170 --> 15:58.690
- Please.
- No phone calls.

15:58.810 --> 16:01.850
- No phone calls.
- Please.

16:01.970 --> 16:03.770
I don't understand you.

16:13.610 --> 16:15.330
Lock her up.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.570
Yes, Mladen.

18:20.410 --> 18:21.810
Of course.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.770
Italians?

18:29.170 --> 18:30.570
Good.

20:13.290 --> 20:16.490
- Hello Ciro.
- Is Mladen upstairs?

20:16.610 --> 20:18.450
Can I have a vodka?

20:21.250 --> 20:24.730
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

21:25.690 --> 21:27.290
You're here.

21:31.850 --> 21:33.530
Are they here already?

21:35.450 --> 21:37.130
Why, are you in a hurry?

21:40.570 --> 21:42.530
They're on their way.

21:56.850 --> 21:59.090
How much are they buying?

22:03.050 --> 22:06.370
- 100,000 euros.
- And the payment?

22:06.490 --> 22:08.210
Cash, on delivery.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.570
Do you know them?

22:13.970 --> 22:15.370
Yes.

22:16.890 --> 22:18.610
They're from the same country as you.

22:22.010 --> 22:26.650
Take them to the VIP room,
then I'll watch everything from there.

22:30.010 --> 22:32.610
Who are you, then? Big Brother?

22:32.730 --> 22:36.370
The agreement is clear:
I don't work with Neapolitans.

22:37.970 --> 22:39.770
'I don't work...'

22:42.730 --> 22:44.490
You are really strange.

22:50.610 --> 22:53.090
You don't drink, you don't fuck...

22:56.610 --> 23:00.730
You live in a shithole even...

23:00.850 --> 23:03.490
an Albanian whore would be disgusted by.

23:11.770 --> 23:14.490
You're afraid of your fellow countrymen.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.850
I don't understand
what my father sees in you.

23:31.890 --> 23:33.410
Now get lost.

24:15.930 --> 24:19.290
- Enzo.
- Enzo is here.

26:03.610 --> 26:04.730
Hey, Ciro.

26:06.610 --> 26:08.210
Show me that money.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.730
Hurry up, Tatiana.

26:17.050 --> 26:18.450
I'm waiting.

26:24.330 --> 26:27.810
What about that money?
Is there a problem?

26:32.570 --> 26:34.330
Is there something wrong with it?

26:36.930 --> 26:38.770
Let me change it for you.

26:40.170 --> 26:41.930
Get back to work.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.730
Their money is not good.

28:19.050 --> 28:21.010
Do you want to make a fool of me?

28:22.530 --> 28:25.850
You asked me for my opinion
and I gave it to you.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.090
Do whatever you want with it.

28:31.570 --> 28:36.730
This filthy greaseball
thinks he can tell me what to do.

28:36.850 --> 28:39.130
Fuck.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.130
Are you standing up to me?

28:45.690 --> 28:50.410
These are friends of mine,
there is nothing wrong with their money.

28:52.330 --> 28:56.290
If you think it's okay,
then we'll all think it's okay.

28:56.410 --> 28:59.170
Don't turn my back on me, asshole.

28:59.290 --> 29:00.970
Come back.

29:12.770 --> 29:15.170
Listen, you little maggot.

29:15.290 --> 29:17.210
You go to my office...

29:17.330 --> 29:20.650
and you count the profits,
like you always do.

29:20.770 --> 29:25.850
And I don't want to hear you anymore,
understand? Get lost.

29:25.970 --> 29:27.730
Piece of shit.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.330
Get in, you.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.290
Brother.

30:53.410 --> 30:57.370
- What are you doing in this shithole?
- I'm not your brother.

30:58.650 --> 31:01.730
Should we call you uncle, or what?

31:01.850 --> 31:05.170
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

31:05.290 --> 31:10.530
- Is this a joke?
- You told us to wait for you here.

31:11.730 --> 31:16.210
The money is in a car at the airport,
for safety.

31:16.330 --> 31:19.410
If you have a problem, you can call him.

31:22.330 --> 31:24.290
There are no problems.

31:26.290 --> 31:29.250
- Let's go.
- Come.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.450
How can you live here?

31:49.570 --> 31:52.170
Ah well, you have to live somewhere.

31:52.290 --> 31:54.330
You won't get me out of Naples.

31:56.810 --> 32:01.810
- Where is that parking garage?
- Wait a second. Damn...

32:02.890 --> 32:04.610
Hurry up.

32:05.570 --> 32:08.730
Go left further up the road,
at that sign.

32:08.850 --> 32:14.850
- So you learned their language?
- Of course. He works here, right?

32:14.970 --> 32:17.170
You're smart enough for it.

32:17.290 --> 32:21.090
I don't understand,
they just look like barking dogs.

32:24.530 --> 32:27.410
Hurry up, I'm not here to chat.

32:47.650 --> 32:50.850
Show him the way, I'll follow you.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.010
I'll go with you.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.250
How nice.

33:01.250 --> 33:04.490
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.330
You know the way.

34:10.489 --> 34:12.889
What's he doing? Drive.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.409
Where is the money?

34:58.850 --> 35:01.010
- What are you doing?
- It's fake.

35:02.930 --> 35:06.530
According to Santo,
only losers kill for money.

35:08.210 --> 35:10.810
Real men don't.

35:10.930 --> 35:14.690
- But how do you know who's what?
- Do you think there's a difference?

35:15.890 --> 35:21.090
My family has done more for Naples
than anyone else.

35:21.210 --> 35:24.210
Grandpa worked miracles,
just like San Gennaro.

35:24.330 --> 35:29.010
We came up with the System.
Do you understand where I'm from?

35:31.770 --> 35:35.690
Say what you want, but if you don't
have respect, you are not a man.

35:36.810 --> 35:40.890
If you want to screw someone over,
you must get to know them first.

35:41.010 --> 35:45.690
You didn't realize who I am,
you've underestimated me.

35:45.820 --> 35:47.460
And now you have a problem.

35:48.810 --> 35:53.770
Your grandfather would've never ended up
in this shitty situation.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.330
If you want to shoot, do it.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.530
I won't kill you.

36:14.410 --> 36:17.490
But you do have to tell me the truth.

36:27.650 --> 36:31.370
Call your friends to pick you up
and go back to Naples.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.810
I never want to see you again.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.290
One day, you'll get homesick.

36:57.410 --> 37:01.130
The best pizzas in Naples come
from Forcella, you know that.

37:29.130 --> 37:33.370
Are the five kilos of heroin ready
for our Neapolitan customers?

37:34.290 --> 37:35.690
Hurry up.

37:41.810 --> 37:43.450
In the bag.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.810
Hello, Ciro.

38:21.930 --> 38:25.930
Outside is a car full of money
from the Neapolitans.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.930
Did they buy the stuff?

38:28.050 --> 38:32.010
I didn't give it to them,
their money was fake.

38:32.130 --> 38:34.730
But that is not the biggest problem.

38:37.730 --> 38:39.890
They had a deal with Mladen.

38:41.170 --> 38:44.810
A deal? What kind of deal?
I don't get it.

38:44.930 --> 38:49.090
Mladen called them and asked if they
wanted to bring counterfeit money.

38:49.210 --> 38:54.250
If they'd bring 100,000 in counterfeit
euros, he would give the stuff for free.

38:54.370 --> 38:56.170
Why?

38:56.290 --> 39:00.530
To set me up, so it would seem like
I was conspiring with them...

39:00.650 --> 39:02.050
and to screw me over.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.770
Do you think you're worth
100,000 euros to him?

39:05.890 --> 39:11.530
Me? No. You're worth that much to your son.
He thinks I want to take his place.

39:17.690 --> 39:21.970
If I had no son,
I would want one like you.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.210
But I already have a son.

39:25.290 --> 39:26.970
I'm sorry.

39:30.850 --> 39:32.570
Me too.

39:51.850 --> 39:53.410
If I had a son...

39:54.970 --> 39:58.370
I would confront him myself...

39:58.490 --> 40:00.850
if he acted like an asshole.

40:03.250 --> 40:04.890
Go outside.

41:55.650 --> 41:57.050
- Hello, Ciro.
- Hey.

42:24.290 --> 42:26.170
What are you waiting for?

42:27.130 --> 42:30.410
Get in. Hurry up.

43:13.410 --> 43:15.410
Hurry up.

43:42.930 --> 43:44.970
Get down.

45:34.250 --> 45:35.850
I don't understand.

45:48.690 --> 45:50.690
It's all the same gibberish.

46:44.210 --> 46:50.770
MACEDONIAN-ALBANIAN BORDER

47:50.930 --> 47:52.690
Behave yourself.
