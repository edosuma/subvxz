WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:02.036
The government's cracking down.

00:02.069 --> 00:04.238
If mutants are gonna survive,
it's up to us.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.672
JACE:
We're pursuing terrorists.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.673
Our country,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.709
our species is under attack.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.811
We're up against people
that don't think of us as human.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.713
We love like they do.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.181
We die like they do.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.016
My family needs help.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.551
(siren wailing)

00:17.584 --> 00:19.053
(grunts)
Come on!

00:19.086 --> 00:20.420
Let's go!
Go now!

00:21.621 --> 00:23.423
What your kids can do--

00:23.457 --> 00:25.225
their power is incredible.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.695
This is our family history.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.497
They're "rumored to be part
of a shadowy organization

00:30.530 --> 00:32.599
called the Hellfire Club."

00:32.632 --> 00:34.368
-On the ground.
-Fire.

00:34.401 --> 00:35.402
-(gunfire)
-Fire.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.872
-Fire.
-No, no!

00:37.905 --> 00:40.240
-(gunshot)
-What are they doing here?

00:40.274 --> 00:41.375
We need your help.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.376
Make no mistake,

00:42.409 --> 00:43.911
the humans will
come for us all.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.013
-Those girls are liars.
-Are they?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.114
ESME:
Your father

00:47.147 --> 00:49.183
was a member
of the Hellfire Club.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.451
I can see your father's power
in you.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.921
I think about our own kid

00:53.954 --> 00:56.556
and the world we're bringing
that baby into.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.125
You want to protect the child?

00:58.158 --> 00:59.259
Join us.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.761
It's time to make a new world.

01:00.795 --> 01:02.797
(screams)

01:02.830 --> 01:04.064
I can't help you do this.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.432
The people we're here for--

01:05.465 --> 01:06.600
they know who they are.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.268
You are not taking our son.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.104
No, no.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.305
(gasps)

01:11.338 --> 01:13.340
It's my decision.
Don't try to stop me.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.646
REEVA:
I know

01:19.679 --> 01:21.982
that a lot of you are upset
about what happened in Atlanta.

01:22.016 --> 01:25.752
I asked you here today
so we could put that behind us.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.755
You want answers.

01:28.789 --> 01:32.192
Well, I have them,
if you will just listen.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.999
What do we all want?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.802
It's simple. We want peace.

01:41.836 --> 01:44.138
We want freedom.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.842
We want to feel safe
in our homes.

01:49.709 --> 01:52.112
Let's be honest.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.680
None of that happens

01:53.713 --> 01:56.350
unless mutants have a place
of their own.

01:56.383 --> 02:00.020
In Atlanta we found new mutants,

02:00.054 --> 02:02.957
strong enough
to make that dream come true.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.792
And did we break
a few rules? Maybe.

02:05.826 --> 02:10.164
But we did it for the sake
of a dream we all share.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.431
Let's press forward

02:11.465 --> 02:14.634
to building a future
that we have together.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.903
(William claps slowly)

02:19.706 --> 02:21.441
Enough.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.643
A very pretty speech, Reeva.
Bravo.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.014
But...

02:27.047 --> 02:28.849
the mutant homeland project
has been discussed

02:28.883 --> 02:30.484
and dismissed.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.487
-It is too dangerous.
-Dangerous for who, William?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.722
Mutants are dying.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.558
I didn't claw my way out
of the mutant slums of Chicago

02:38.592 --> 02:41.495
just to sip martinis in comfort
while our people suffer.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.698
I earned a seat at this table
by taking risks.

02:44.731 --> 02:47.634
Oh, we're well aware
of the risks you took.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.169
You and your pets.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.171
You know what they say, William.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.673
Well-behaved women
rarely make history.

02:53.707 --> 02:58.045
Recruiting a mentally unstable
pregnant woman? A child?

02:58.078 --> 03:00.380
You are talking about Polaris.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.582
How often does a mutant
like her come along?

03:02.616 --> 03:06.153
Once a decade?
Once a generation?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.487
The Von Strucker family

03:07.521 --> 03:10.090
helped to build
this Hellfire Club.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.492
It doesn't matter.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.994
As one voice on the council,

03:14.028 --> 03:15.862
you had no right
to make this decision.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.497
You acted completely
without authorization.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.266
(scoffs) If we waited
for your authorization,

03:19.299 --> 03:20.700
we'd never do anything.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.204
William, the girls acted
on my instructions.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.673
-You had no right.
-Your plan is insane.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.375
WILLIAM:
The point is...

03:28.408 --> 03:31.545
you acted without the blessing

03:31.578 --> 03:33.047
of the Inner Circle.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.152
Yes.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.056
(exhales)

03:42.089 --> 03:44.858
Well, I've always believed
that it is better

03:44.891 --> 03:46.860
to ask for forgiveness
than for permission.

03:46.893 --> 03:47.894
(deep breath)

03:48.963 --> 03:50.965
(singing high tone)

04:04.111 --> 04:05.312
(gasps)

04:21.962 --> 04:22.997
(clears throat)

04:35.109 --> 04:37.111
Forgive me.

05:01.235 --> 05:02.736
(chuckles)

05:09.676 --> 05:11.678
Hey.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.380
Are you ready to go?

05:13.413 --> 05:14.614
You don't have to come,
you know.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.615
What do you mean?

05:15.649 --> 05:18.318
You go, I go.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.854
Something wrong?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.690
When I dreamed
of having a baby, I...

05:27.694 --> 05:29.829
I thought I'd be with family.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.033
ANDY:
Lorna, it's gonna be okay.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.169
We're your family now.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.537
I'm here if you need anything.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.673
So if I get preeclampsia,
what will you do?

05:39.706 --> 05:42.042
My best.

05:42.076 --> 05:45.079
(both chuckle)

05:45.112 --> 05:46.713
Shall we?

05:52.186 --> 05:56.190
OFFICER: This is Sentinel
Services. This is a raid.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.492
Come out with your hands up.
We've surrounded the building.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.726
Surrender immediately.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.429
I repeat,
we have you surrounded.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.098
Surrender immediately.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.765
(dog barking)

06:08.802 --> 06:10.704
Freeze! Get down!

06:10.737 --> 06:12.839
(overlapping shouting)

06:12.872 --> 06:14.874
Wait! We didn't do anything!
We didn't do anything!

06:14.908 --> 06:16.076
Girls, run!

06:16.110 --> 06:17.944
-Get out! Get out!
-(gunshots)

06:19.546 --> 06:21.581
-What's happening?
-Oh, God.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.583
We have to get out.
We have to get out.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.752
Jazmine, stand back
and take cover.

06:27.754 --> 06:28.788
(Jazmine screams)

06:31.458 --> 06:33.059
DISPATCHER (over radio):
All local law enforcement,

06:33.093 --> 06:35.629
be advised of action at
Liberty Park housing complex.

06:35.662 --> 06:36.963
(continues indistinctly)

06:38.064 --> 06:39.899
(line ringing)

06:39.933 --> 06:41.868
REED:
Hey, John, it's me.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.403
Something just came up
on the scanner.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.639
Sentinel Services is raiding
Liberty Park complex.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.873
They just notified
local police.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.275
All right,
tell Lauren and Clarice.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.677
We'll need everyone
on this. Marcos!

06:54.080 --> 06:56.750
-We got to move, now!
-How bad?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.752
Bad as it gets.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.520
(overlapping shouting)

07:08.128 --> 07:09.163
Stay down, mutie.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.931
(shouting)

07:16.470 --> 07:17.471
Stay down.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.972
OFFICER:
Get on the ground.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.687
THUNDERBIRD: I tracked
two groups. One came this way.

07:35.822 --> 07:38.492
Where are they?

07:38.525 --> 07:40.494
In there.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.799
Whoa.

07:46.733 --> 07:47.934
H-Hey, whoa! Chill.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.536
Don't do whatever it is
you're about to do.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.706
We're the good guys. Let's go.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.508
Hey, I found the first group.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.543
I think the second one
went into the storm drains

07:56.576 --> 07:57.777
on the north side.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.013
Yeah, we're on our way.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.681
Sounds like we made it
just in time.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.684
Maybe. We haven't
saved anyone yet.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.220
Something wrong there, sunshine?

08:06.253 --> 08:09.022
Sorry, it's just...

08:09.055 --> 08:10.857
It's the third raid this month.

08:10.890 --> 08:14.127
I know it's a lot, but that's
why we're here, right?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.029
Right.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.703
Where are they? No one's here.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.904
(loud thump)

08:24.938 --> 08:27.374
CRISTINA:
We have to get out!

08:30.076 --> 08:31.411
MAN:
Got a group inside!

08:31.445 --> 08:33.380
They're coming in.
We have to run!

08:33.413 --> 08:34.381
There's no other way out.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.883
(overlapping chatter)

08:38.618 --> 08:41.721
Open the door now!
We will shoot!

08:42.722 --> 08:43.923
Go! Now!

08:49.095 --> 08:50.930
Run!

08:52.699 --> 08:53.867
(men grunting)

09:04.644 --> 09:06.613
DR. KELSEY: We've got
a punctured lung in Two.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.515
-Can you handle this on your...
-It's fine. I've got it.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.516
-It hurts.
-I know.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.951
-Just breathe. Not much longer.
-(screams)

09:14.220 --> 09:16.222
Okay, Cristina.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.792
-Oh, God.
-Cristina, I need you
to control your powers.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.728
All right? Just keep breathing.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.431
-I have to stop the bleeding.
-(straining)

09:26.099 --> 09:27.767
Breathe, breathe. Almost there.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.769
Okay, okay.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.739
Okay, that's it. That's it.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.776
Did you find my sister?

09:36.810 --> 09:40.447
Her name is Jazmine.
She's only 12. We got separated

09:40.480 --> 09:44.217
after my parents got... killed.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.619
I...

09:45.652 --> 09:48.021
As soon as we're done here,
we'll ask, okay?

09:51.358 --> 09:54.894
Uh, the place
that you were living,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.297
there were lots
of mutants there?

09:57.331 --> 10:01.100
I guess. Why?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.139
I lost someone, too.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.174
(indistinct chatter)

10:28.895 --> 10:31.331
(buttons beeping)

10:43.042 --> 10:45.645
Hey. How'd it go in there?

10:45.679 --> 10:49.315
Oh... Well,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.719
I plugged a lot of leaks.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.355
I made papers and IDs
for the people we picked up.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.557
Should be good enough
to get 'em out of town, but...

10:57.591 --> 10:59.593
Reed.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.397
What are we doing here?

11:03.430 --> 11:06.199
Hey.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.902
We rescued ten people.
That's a good day.

11:11.705 --> 11:15.241
I-I asked the ones I treated
about Andy, but...

11:15.274 --> 11:17.877
no one knew anything.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.879
Of course, I can't even
use his real name

11:19.913 --> 11:21.381
since the police think
we're all dead.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.849
(sniffles)

11:27.687 --> 11:29.656
Just have to keep on trying.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.925
No, we have already
searched for so long.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.660
All those cities.

11:33.693 --> 11:38.698
When John tracked Andy and Lorna
to D.C., I-I hoped...

11:38.732 --> 11:40.299
I know.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.074
I did, too.

12:19.138 --> 12:21.140
REEVA:
Well, Lorna, what do you think?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.980
POLARIS:
This is where I'm giving birth?

12:27.013 --> 12:28.615
Lovely. What-what is it?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.617
It was originally
a munitions warehouse.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.552
All stone and concrete.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.789
We'll modify it, of course,
for your comfort.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.225
POLARIS: A comfortable
munitions warehouse.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.561
This was the only place
strong enough.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.429
(groaning)

12:44.798 --> 12:47.066
(tires screech)

12:47.100 --> 12:49.102
(panting)

12:54.040 --> 12:56.843
Sorry. The baby's just kicking.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.451
REED: I know what happened
yesterday was hard on all of us.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.286
Losing Liberty Park was a blow.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.456
But because of what we did,
ten mutants

13:10.490 --> 13:12.892
and their families get
to start new lives today.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.995
So we should try
and focus on that.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.797
I organized transportation

13:17.831 --> 13:19.833
for the folks we took in,
got 'em documents.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.769
Shatter's crew in Baltimore
are gonna take most of 'em,

13:22.802 --> 13:25.805
get 'em someplace safe.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.641
Cristina, the girl
that cut her hand,

13:27.674 --> 13:29.643
she doesn't want to leave
without her sister.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.177
Can you find her?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.179
I don't know.
The trail's a day old.

13:33.212 --> 13:35.348
Well, we can try. Right?

13:35.381 --> 13:38.017
-Maybe she can stay
at our place for a while?
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.153
All right. If that's all...

13:40.186 --> 13:42.822
Hang on. There's one more thing.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.223
I've been asking around,
and I think I might

13:44.257 --> 13:46.459
-have found something.
-About Andy and Lorna?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.528
ECLIPSE: Not exactly,
but you remember those hackers

13:48.562 --> 13:50.129
-we heard about?
-CAITLIN: The mutants who can

13:50.163 --> 13:52.398
-get into the computer systems?
-Yeah.

13:52.431 --> 13:55.468
I talked to the main guy.
His name's Wire.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.205
-I reached out.
-What? You said those guys
were criminals.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.975
-We discussed this.
-We said we weren't
gonna pursue it.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.043
Well, maybe we should.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.411
What else do we have?

14:05.444 --> 14:07.480
The only thing
keeping us safe right now

14:07.513 --> 14:09.515
is the government thinks
we died in Atlanta.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.552
-We have to be careful.
-My kid's about
to be born, John.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.089
Maybe I'm done being careful.

14:20.259 --> 14:22.361
(Polaris humming)

14:29.102 --> 14:30.870
(grunts, inhales sharply)

14:30.904 --> 14:33.907
-(panting)
-(knocking on door)

14:36.976 --> 14:38.578
Hi.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.614
Just came to see
if you were okay.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.616
Look, if this is
about the car...

14:42.649 --> 14:44.250
The pregnancy's been
affecting my powers.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.085
-I'm trying to control it.
-I am not worried

14:46.119 --> 14:47.954
about the car.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.095
Look, it's just...

14:56.129 --> 14:57.797
(exhales)

14:57.831 --> 15:01.567
...being here, alone.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.536
Lorna.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.705
I get it.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.574
The first thing
I ever felt was alone.

15:08.608 --> 15:12.245
I was hated for my poverty,

15:12.278 --> 15:16.482
then for the color of my skin,
then for my powers.

15:16.515 --> 15:19.118
But we are here to change that.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.419
Together.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.155
We need you.

15:22.188 --> 15:26.626
You've needed
other people before.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.894
What do you mean by that?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.596
I hear things. Rumors.

15:30.630 --> 15:35.334
About the mutants that were part
of the Inner Circle before.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.806
(sighs)

15:39.839 --> 15:44.944
Have I made sacrifices? Yes.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.480
I lost good friends, Lorna.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.116
But for the sake of what it is
that we are building,

15:50.149 --> 15:52.151
I would sacrifice anything.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.689
You're gonna be fine.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.291
The girls are taking care
of everything.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.699
Name?

16:05.732 --> 16:08.167
Our names don't matter.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.704
Right. Sorry about that.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.876
I-I don't understand.

16:16.910 --> 16:20.313
You want me to get
everyone to leave?

16:20.346 --> 16:21.715
Today?

16:21.748 --> 16:22.849
Yes.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.684
(laughs softly)

16:24.718 --> 16:26.152
I-I can't do that.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.553
Actually, you can.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.288
PHOEBE: You handle class-one
toxic materials.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.524
Tell them there was a spill,
and evacuate.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.392
And then keep your mouth shut.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.063
Forever.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.067
MAN:
There are laws.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.703
I-I can't just hand this place
over to a bunch of...

16:43.737 --> 16:45.705
A bunch of... what?

16:45.739 --> 16:48.474
Just to be clear, we can make
you do whatever we want.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.343
The cash is just easier.

16:50.376 --> 16:53.546
The question today isn't
whether this place is ours.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.082
The question is whether
you give it to us,

16:56.115 --> 16:57.717
or we take it.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.359
It's done.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.899
(Zingo whines)

17:12.932 --> 17:14.500
THUNDERBIRD:
What?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.369
-Want this?
-(barks)

17:16.402 --> 17:18.504
Here.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.773
Here you go.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.241
You sure you don't want
anything to eat?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.210
I can't.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.345
I keep thinking about my sister.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.515
Hey, don't underestimate John

17:29.548 --> 17:31.785
just because he can
rock a man bun.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.553
-(chuckles)
-He's very good
at tracking people.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.557
Do you really think
he can find her?

17:38.591 --> 17:42.095
Well, if he found me,
believe me, he can find anybody.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.565
Here. Try to get some rest.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.806
(Thunderbird sighs)

17:58.244 --> 17:59.813
You're sexy when you do dishes.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.747
(chuckles)
Thanks.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.252
Hey, how's she doing?

18:06.285 --> 18:08.654
Uh, she'll be okay.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.657
She's not really the one
I'm worried about right now.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.326
Did you see Marcos?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.995
I swear, the closer we get
to that baby's due date,

18:16.029 --> 18:17.831
the less rational he gets.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.834
I know.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.301
I'll talk to him, all right?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.875
(laughs softly)

18:33.312 --> 18:35.949
Do you really want
to get me in the mood?

18:35.982 --> 18:37.283
(laughs softly)

18:37.316 --> 18:39.886
Finish the dishes.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.423
All right.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.026
That's... manipulative.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.862
It's highly effective, though.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.834
Hey, sorry to be back so late.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.803
It's okay. How was Baltimore?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.473
Fine.
(exhales)

19:00.506 --> 19:02.608
We got lucky at the checkpoints.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.810
Everyone made it through safe.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.880
How was the shelter?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.281
It was fine.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.116
REED: You making
any friends down there?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.350
LAUREN:
Not really.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.786
-Unless you count Ivan.
-(sharp ringing)

19:13.819 --> 19:17.456
He mainly talks to himself.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.058
(ringing stops)

19:19.092 --> 19:22.161
REED: Maybe it's time
we found you a job.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.330
Someplace you can meet
people your own age.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.000
Reed, most of the information
we have

19:27.033 --> 19:29.302
Lauren got through people
she met at the shelter.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.670
I know, but her sole focus
can't be just looking...

19:31.704 --> 19:33.706
Her little brother
is still missing.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.241
Finding him isn't a priority?

19:35.274 --> 19:36.509
Of course it is.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.977
But she needs to live her life.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.812
I don't mind
the shelters. Really.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.847
-Lauren...
-Look, could we do this later?

19:42.882 --> 19:44.683
I need to be alone right now.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.594
(horn honking in distance)

20:18.417 --> 20:19.885
Andy?

20:22.721 --> 20:23.957
Andy.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.792
(gasping)

20:31.597 --> 20:33.132
(panting):
Oh, my God.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.534
(laughs):
Your hair. What-- your clothes.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.937
I wasn't sure it was you.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.148
-No.
-Why are you fighting?

20:50.349 --> 20:51.784
-This is who we are.
-No.

20:51.817 --> 20:52.986
No, let go.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.320
It's who we're meant to be.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.322
No, let go!

21:08.101 --> 21:09.802
No! No!

21:09.835 --> 21:11.837
(gasping)

21:16.542 --> 21:20.113
It was weird.
It didn't feel like a dream.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.348
You think you saw him?
You saw Andy?

21:22.381 --> 21:23.782
Yes.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.985
He looked older, different.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.120
Where were you?

21:27.153 --> 21:28.654
It was a parking garage.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.123
I could see the Capitol.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.457
So-so you were here?

21:31.490 --> 21:33.526
-Cait. Cait?
-In the city.

21:33.559 --> 21:34.793
Let her catch her breath.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.863
I am just trying to figure out
what happened.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.365
This could be important.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.435
Maybe, but it could
just be a dream.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.203
They used their powers
together, Reed.

21:44.237 --> 21:45.504
They-they said
they could see through

21:45.538 --> 21:48.007
-each other's eyes.
-Mom. Mom.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.876
It might not have been him.

21:50.909 --> 21:54.280
It's all fuzzy now, and...

21:54.313 --> 21:56.049
I'm sorry.

22:00.186 --> 22:03.889
No, it's... it's all right.

22:03.922 --> 22:09.662
Let's just, um... forget it.

22:09.695 --> 22:12.665
-(sniffles)
-Hey. Hey.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.235
I'm gonna go get you
something to drink.

22:30.949 --> 22:32.951
(sighs)

22:43.362 --> 22:45.698
(dialing)

22:45.731 --> 22:46.832
(line ringing)

22:46.865 --> 22:48.367
ECLIPSE (on phone):
Caitlin?

22:48.401 --> 22:50.369
The mutant hacker
you reached out to.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.205
I want to talk to him.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.508
Okay. Um...

22:55.541 --> 22:57.676
I thought
they wanted us to wait.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.945
I think Andy might be close.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.948
I'm done waiting.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.983
(workers speaking indistinctly)

23:17.330 --> 23:19.598
Make sure these are tight.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.100
The joints need to be sealed.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.802
Yeah, they're in.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.239
Make sure you double-check,
all right?

23:26.272 --> 23:27.806
Lorna, we've been chatting
with the doctor.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.942
He's concerned that you
shouldn't be exerting yourself.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.211
I'm just getting things ready.
I'm fine.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.912
Ms. Dane, with all due respect,

23:33.946 --> 23:35.248
you had a pre-term contraction

23:35.281 --> 23:37.116
that moved a 6,000-pound car.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.618
You should be
on bed rest immediately.

23:41.987 --> 23:43.789
Fine.

23:43.822 --> 23:46.325
Andrew, would you mind
helping them outside?

23:46.359 --> 23:47.793
Of course.

23:47.826 --> 23:48.961
REEVA:
Doctor.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.733
Andy, I, uh...

23:54.767 --> 23:56.101
I need to talk to you.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.603
What's up?

23:57.636 --> 23:59.305
I have a bad feeling.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.742
I think the birth
may not go well.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.943
You're crazy.
You got everything you need.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.279
You've got a great doctor.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.813
Things can still happen, okay?

24:07.846 --> 24:10.015
If something does go wrong,
and it...

24:10.048 --> 24:11.884
it comes down to me
or the baby, sh...

24:13.219 --> 24:16.121
She will choose me.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.924
Do you understand?
I need you to protect the baby.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.161
Wh-What do you mean?
What am I supposed to do?

24:22.195 --> 24:26.965
Andy, you are a Von Strucker.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.469
Stop them.
However you have to.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.138
Promise me.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.880
Yeah. Okay.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.316
I promise.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.692
You really think I need these?

24:53.726 --> 24:56.128
Well, Sentinel Services
could still be around.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.363
Better to be safe.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.864
And tracking down
Cristina's sister

24:58.897 --> 25:00.866
-could take a while.
-Well, I don't feel safe.

25:00.899 --> 25:03.702
I feel exposed...
and I look basic.

25:03.736 --> 25:07.072
I mean, I can't portal
with these stupid things.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.041
You know, I can't see
the portal. The energy.

25:09.074 --> 25:10.809
-You know, the stuff.
-Yeah.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.545
Maybe if you practice.

25:12.578 --> 25:18.417
That's like asking someone
to practice darts blindfolded.

25:18.451 --> 25:19.552
In a hurricane.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.387
-Is it? Oh.
-Yeah, it is.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.722
It's impossible.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.057
Have you talked to Marcos yet?

25:25.090 --> 25:27.226
Not yet.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.697
Behold the powerful Thunderbird,

25:31.730 --> 25:34.367
who bravely avoids talking
to his best friend.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.701
(laughs)

25:35.734 --> 25:37.069
All right, come on.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.974
(car alarm blaring in distance)

25:44.243 --> 25:46.011
You sure you want to do this?

25:46.044 --> 25:48.080
-I called you, remember?
-Yeah, I know.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.683
But the guy we're talking to
is erratic.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.251
He's got a bit
of a drug problem.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.919
You know how
Kick addicts can get.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.187
I don't care what he's on,

25:55.220 --> 25:56.622
as long as he knows something.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.024
Well, look,
he may know something.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.193
Okay, listen,
when we get inside,

26:01.226 --> 26:02.528
let me do all the talking.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.363
If things go sideways,
I'll handle it.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.131
I've been training, you know.

26:06.164 --> 26:08.701
I'm not talking
about a few pull-ups

26:08.734 --> 26:10.636
with John at the scrapyard.

26:10.669 --> 26:13.306
These guys, they play for keeps.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.874
Great.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.176
I'll just stand there
and look human.

26:21.347 --> 26:22.915
(door buzzer sounds)

26:28.287 --> 26:29.822
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

26:36.529 --> 26:37.663
You looking for Wire?

26:37.696 --> 26:41.099
He's back there.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.201
Hi.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.647
So, what is this?

26:54.680 --> 26:59.318
Thought this was
a one-on-one meeting.

26:59.352 --> 27:00.686
She's just a friend.

27:00.719 --> 27:04.022
I'm interested in
the same thing he is.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.759
Okay, maybe you two are confused

27:06.792 --> 27:09.528
about how secret meetings work.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.430
Okay, more interested friends

27:11.464 --> 27:12.998
is a bad thing,
not a good thing.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.667
She's cool, all right?

27:14.700 --> 27:17.269
Did you find anything?

27:17.302 --> 27:19.838
No, dude.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.974
I set up this meeting
to tell you I got nothing.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.678
I always get something, bitch.

27:25.711 --> 27:27.112
I make love to the machine,

27:27.145 --> 27:29.348
and the machine gives me
everything that I want.

27:29.382 --> 27:30.983
Can we get to the point, here?

27:31.016 --> 27:33.686
The point, uninvited friend,

27:33.719 --> 27:36.889
is that this Hellfire Club,
they're into some heavy stuff.

27:36.922 --> 27:38.391
Stuff light-hands here
didn't bother to bring up

27:38.424 --> 27:41.126
when we made
our little arrangement.

27:41.159 --> 27:44.062
Which leads us
to a bit of business.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.465
Hey, oh!
Ah-ah. Ah-ah.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.534
Hands in your pockets there,
bright boy.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.669
We're renegotiating.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.405
Okay?

27:54.573 --> 27:55.908
ECLIPSE:
Wire, don't do this.

27:55.941 --> 27:57.376
We don't have any more money.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.412
Well, then we may have
a problem.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.580
'Cause these people you're
looking for? They got money.

28:01.614 --> 28:06.318
Okay? You can't pay for them,
maybe they could pay for you.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.687
-Hey!
-(grunting)

28:08.721 --> 28:10.022
(Wire groaning)

28:10.055 --> 28:12.658
Ow! Ow!

28:12.691 --> 28:15.027
(Caitlin panting)

28:16.795 --> 28:18.897
Okay, Sparky.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.199
You need to listen
very carefully.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.501
You need to send
your friends away

28:22.535 --> 28:25.037
and give us what we came for,

28:25.070 --> 28:27.072
or you're gonna get a bullet
to your motherboard.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.576
-One, two...
-(shouts)

28:30.609 --> 28:31.877
She's only gonna count
to three, man.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.046
WIRE:
Okay, okay!

28:34.079 --> 28:35.548
Ch-Chill!

28:41.954 --> 28:44.256
WIRE: I think we can agree
there were mistakes made

28:44.289 --> 28:45.924
on both sides. Let's just
walk away, let's just forget...

28:45.958 --> 28:48.226
ECLIPSE: Yeah,
the time to call it off was

28:48.260 --> 28:50.596
-before you tried robbing us.
-I'm just trying to help.

28:50.629 --> 28:52.898
Your friend, here? She's hurt.
She took a bullet to the chest.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.033
CAITLIN: It's just a grazed rib.
You want to see what a bullet

28:55.067 --> 28:57.402
to the chest looks like?
Keep stalling.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.404
-Just... get...
-(snaps fingers)

29:01.507 --> 29:03.275
Get out.

29:03.308 --> 29:06.044
Okay. Listen.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.247
(Caitlin panting)

29:09.281 --> 29:12.084
Okay, this Hellfire Club, um,

29:12.117 --> 29:14.787
they spun off something
called the Inner Circle.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.254
Maybe there was
a management change,

29:16.288 --> 29:19.291
maybe Hellfire Club sounded

29:19.324 --> 29:20.425
gratuitously sinister.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.427
And this Inner Circle?

29:22.461 --> 29:23.929
It's well hidden.
Like, very well hidden.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.299
Like, 12 layers of shell
companies hidden. Check it.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.238
So this account's
at a Caymans bank

29:33.271 --> 29:35.974
owned by an outfit in Panama

29:36.008 --> 29:38.811
that runs all its business
through Mauritius.

29:38.844 --> 29:40.846
And the money?

29:40.879 --> 29:44.817
$55 million, U.S., right there.

29:44.850 --> 29:47.486
And they got dozens
just like it.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.522
Anything on where they are?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.757
Yeah, genius.
They put their home address

29:51.790 --> 29:53.659
on their secret accounts.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.494
We don't care about the money.

29:55.528 --> 29:57.029
We want to find the people.

29:57.062 --> 30:00.132
Okay, see,
that's where you're wrong.

30:00.165 --> 30:02.200
You do not want
to find the people.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.437
Because one thing
is very, very clear.

30:05.470 --> 30:09.174
You mess with these guys,
you disappear.

30:09.207 --> 30:11.376
Now, what does
that mean, exactly?

30:11.409 --> 30:13.378
Am I speaking too fast?

30:13.411 --> 30:16.048
If you steal from them,
you go away.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.784
If someone sues them,
they go away.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.986
That's why I wanted
more money, Marcos.

30:21.019 --> 30:24.322
'Cause I'm scared
of the bad people.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.358
Okay, you can go ahead
and shoot him now.

30:26.391 --> 30:28.827
Just tell us what they're doing.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.664
All I know
is they got big plans,

30:31.697 --> 30:33.031
I'm not getting in the way.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.869
You want more?

30:36.902 --> 30:38.503
It's all in there.

30:39.404 --> 30:40.706
Knock yourselves out.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.109
Thanks, man.

30:45.243 --> 30:46.745
This was fun.

30:47.946 --> 30:50.415
Don't do drugs.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.152
I-I don't understand.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.988
Did you find Jazmine
or didn't you?

30:56.021 --> 30:57.690
Well, we tracked her
across the city.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.725
BLINK: Seems she was trying
to get out of town.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.359
She got to the bus station.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.095
Then what?

31:04.062 --> 31:06.231
It looked
like she got picked up.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.900
Oh, God.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.368
But hey, hey, look, there was
no sign of a struggle.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.004
All right? We're still hoping
that one of our people

31:12.037 --> 31:13.939
took her in,
we're reaching out now.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.574
LAUREN:
That's good news, okay?

31:15.608 --> 31:16.909
If Sentinel Services found her,
there definitely

31:16.942 --> 31:19.444
would have been a struggle.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.779
We're gonna find her, all right?

31:20.813 --> 31:22.547
It's just gonna take
a little while.

31:22.581 --> 31:23.882
We're gonna follow up
with our contacts,

31:23.916 --> 31:25.450
you're gonna stay
with us, we'll...

31:26.484 --> 31:27.620
Oh, great.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.187
-LAUREN: Mom, what happened?
-It's all right.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.455
THUNDERBIRD: Marcos,
what the hell's going on?

31:30.488 --> 31:32.257
Just paid Wire a visit.
Things went a little sideways.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.558
-It's fine.
-You what? Are you insane?

31:33.592 --> 31:35.594
Guess we missed the invite.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.229
We got what we went for.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.230
You know where they are?

31:38.263 --> 31:40.132
No, but it's something.

31:40.165 --> 31:41.934
It's a step
in the right direction, okay?

31:41.967 --> 31:44.402
Yeah, yeah, Marcos.
It's a triumph.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.222
(phone ringing)

32:04.256 --> 32:05.824
Hello.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.425
THUNDERBIRD:
Reed, it's John.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.761
Listen, I need you to grab

32:08.794 --> 32:10.228
a suture kit and some bandages

32:10.262 --> 32:11.997
-and get home now.
-Why? What's going on?

32:12.030 --> 32:13.465
It's Caitlin.

32:13.498 --> 32:16.969
-(sharp ringing)
-She was grazed by a bullet.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.637
She's gonna be fine.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.074
It's just-- you should get here
as soon as you can, man.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.109
(gasps)

32:26.945 --> 32:28.947
(groaning)

32:37.890 --> 32:39.892
(grunting)

32:48.166 --> 32:49.935
No.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.837
No, no.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.305
No.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.443
(grunting)

32:58.476 --> 33:00.645
POLARIS:
Really, it's all right, Andy.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.114
You can go to bed.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.849
It's no problem.
I'm fine keeping you company.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.319
Are you feeling sick or...?

33:07.352 --> 33:09.855
No, just... just tired.

33:09.888 --> 33:14.292
You want me to pitch more
baby names? I got a bunch.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.829
(chuckles)
The old ones were bad enough.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.864
You should be naming
porn stars, not babies.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.999
-What's wrong with Bolt?
-(scoffs)

33:21.033 --> 33:22.801
Besides, you haven't heard
the new stuff.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.871
(Polaris groaning)

33:25.904 --> 33:28.874
Lorna, what is it?
What's wrong? Are you...?

33:28.907 --> 33:30.709
Get them, Andy. Get them.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.210
It's time. The baby's coming.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.445
-Okay. Okay.
-Go, go, go, go.

33:40.853 --> 33:44.156
Everything metal,
lock it down now!

33:44.189 --> 33:45.991
I think it's time.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.225
It's okay.
Just-just hold on.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.360
It's not that simple.
I can't control...

33:48.393 --> 33:50.896
I ca... (screams)

33:54.900 --> 33:57.002
REEVA:
Get her inside!

33:57.035 --> 33:58.937
DOCTOR: We're not ready.
We need more time.

33:58.971 --> 34:00.906
It seems the child disagrees.
You're the mutant specialist.

34:00.939 --> 34:03.742
You'll figure something out.

34:06.979 --> 34:08.914
You could've been killed.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.216
What else could I do?

34:11.249 --> 34:13.585
Knowing there might be
information out there...

34:13.618 --> 34:15.453
So what now? We're just gonna
run around the country again,

34:15.487 --> 34:16.755
chasing down bank accounts?

34:16.789 --> 34:18.456
Well, it's better than nothing.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.392
Is it?

34:20.425 --> 34:22.027
Look at us.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.396
We searched for six months
and it got us nowhere.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.800
We can't just give up.
Our son was taken, Reed.

34:27.833 --> 34:31.804
No, he wasn't, Mom. He left.
So did Lorna.

34:31.837 --> 34:34.907
We can't just keep acting
like Andy was kidnapped.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.577
He knew what he was doing.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.213
She's right, Cait.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.281
He's 15, he...

34:43.315 --> 34:44.716
LAUREN:
He's too young to fight?

34:44.749 --> 34:47.419
This war came to him.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.621
And this is what he chose
to do about it.

34:49.654 --> 34:52.390
-He's your brother.
-I know that.

34:52.424 --> 34:56.661
I know him better than you
can possibly imagine.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.998
And I'm telling you...

35:00.032 --> 35:02.134
he left us.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.552
(groans)

35:42.574 --> 35:44.642
(screaming)

35:48.013 --> 35:50.215
You're gonna be okay.
We're all here.

35:50.248 --> 35:51.683
Just-just breathe.

35:51.716 --> 35:55.053
-I'm trying to breathe!
-DOCTOR: Push again.

35:55.087 --> 35:56.721
(Polaris screaming)

35:59.357 --> 36:01.693
I know Lauren's upset,

36:01.726 --> 36:03.695
but she can't dismiss
her own brother.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.297
I don't think she's doing that.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.732
She has a point.

36:11.937 --> 36:15.307
Sometimes we get so focused
on this search

36:15.340 --> 36:18.043
that we ignore other issues.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.745
It's not just Lauren.

36:20.778 --> 36:23.048
What-what are you talking about?

36:28.753 --> 36:30.522
(knock on door)

36:30.555 --> 36:33.425
Guys, you have to see this.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.093
Both of you
come to the roof now.

36:35.127 --> 36:36.528
What is it?

36:36.561 --> 36:40.032
Just come. Trust me.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.071
(Polaris screaming)

36:48.106 --> 36:49.841
DOCTOR:
Keep pushing.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.445
(screaming)

36:56.314 --> 36:58.250
(tires screeching)

37:02.988 --> 37:04.556
What's going on?

37:04.589 --> 37:08.260
It's her. She's out there.

37:08.293 --> 37:11.196
It could be, but we don't
know that for sure.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.032
Look, how long was I with Lorna
for? I know her powers.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.901
I know what they look like,

37:16.935 --> 37:18.736
sure as hell know
what they feel like.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.238
Why would she be doing this?

37:20.272 --> 37:22.574
I don't know, but I am
telling you this is her.

37:22.607 --> 37:26.979
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, of course.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.781
-What?
-Contractions.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.984
I think she's having the baby.

37:39.457 --> 37:43.195
(Polaris screaming)

37:45.163 --> 37:47.632
Keep pushing!

37:47.665 --> 37:50.335
(Polaris screaming)

37:55.640 --> 37:58.110
-DOCTOR: Something's wrong.
-What is it?

37:58.143 --> 37:59.111
DOCTOR:
She's not dilating.

37:59.144 --> 38:01.013
Her blood pressure
is off the charts.

38:01.046 --> 38:03.281
She won't be able
to take this much longer.

38:03.315 --> 38:05.117
She's fine. She just needs
to keep pushing. Come on.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.651
(groans)

38:06.684 --> 38:09.021
Doctor, we are not
going to lose her.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.322
DOCTOR: You don't understand.
It's not a medical issue.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.424
I-It's a mental block
of some kind.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.958
It happens sometimes.

38:13.992 --> 38:17.629
If we don't do something soon,
she could die.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.866
(whispering indistinctly)

38:33.678 --> 38:35.513
I can't see it. Can you see it?

38:35.547 --> 38:37.549
Hang on.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.619
-What do you see?
-There.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.321
That way.
Follow the power lines.

38:43.355 --> 38:45.323
This is too slow.
This is too slow!

38:45.357 --> 38:47.025
Can't you just blink us there
or something?

38:47.059 --> 38:48.393
Okay, A, we're miles from there,

38:48.426 --> 38:49.961
and B, we don't know
where we're going.

38:49.994 --> 38:53.398
How many times do I have to tell
you I'm not a freaking wizard?

38:53.431 --> 38:55.433
Yeah. Hold on.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.707
(Blink grunts)

39:08.113 --> 39:10.348
(whispering indistinctly)

39:12.884 --> 39:15.553
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna take care of this.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.021
(Polaris grunting)

39:17.055 --> 39:19.357
(Polaris screaming)

39:21.025 --> 39:22.394
No, I need to know
exactly what you're doing.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.828
If you're gonna hurt
the baby, I...

39:23.861 --> 39:25.897
We are here to help
the baby and Lorna.

39:25.930 --> 39:28.066
She needs to remember
what she's fighting for.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.103
What we're all fighting for.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.004
That's all we're doing.
I promise.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.540
Andy, please. Look at her.

39:35.573 --> 39:37.242
She needs us.

39:37.275 --> 39:40.078
(screaming)

39:42.614 --> 39:45.217
-Okay, okay.
-Lorna.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.552
I need you to listen to me now.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.625
The surge is getting stronger.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.260
We must be getting closer.

39:55.293 --> 39:59.063
Your dream was right, Lauren.
Andy is here.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.735
REEVA:
You need to be strong.

40:03.768 --> 40:04.936
We're gonna show you
why we're here.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.839
We're gonna show you
the dawn of a new age.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.709
Hey, Lorna.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.246
Lorna, look at me, look at me.
It's okay.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.349
(Polaris gasps)

40:18.983 --> 40:21.386
WOMAN:
Today we commemorate

40:21.419 --> 40:23.955
a new era of peace
and prosperity

40:23.988 --> 40:27.225
for all mutantkind.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.927
GIRL:
Mommy.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.999
We did it, baby.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.001
We really did it.

40:37.034 --> 40:38.503
(gasping)

40:40.938 --> 40:44.676
Do you see that? That's for her.
Do you want that?

40:47.279 --> 40:49.414
More than anything.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.017
Then show me you can do this.

40:54.652 --> 40:58.089
* I will save your blood *

40:58.122 --> 41:00.024
* For years... *

41:00.057 --> 41:02.427
(screaming)

41:02.460 --> 41:05.096
* And I will brave *

41:05.129 --> 41:10.335
* Your flood to breathe *

41:10.368 --> 41:12.770
* And I will save *

41:12.804 --> 41:16.174
* Your blood for years... *

41:18.009 --> 41:21.012
No. No! No, what happened?

41:21.045 --> 41:23.080
What happened?

41:33.191 --> 41:34.626
The whole grid went silent.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.530
The power went out everywhere.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.567
Marcos, I'm so sorry.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.236
What does-what does...
what does that mean?

41:47.071 --> 41:50.208
Is she dead? The baby?

41:50.242 --> 41:52.844
What does it mean, John?

41:52.877 --> 41:55.046
I don't-I don't know, brother.

41:56.113 --> 41:59.016
ECLIPSE:
We were so close.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.918
No!

42:00.952 --> 42:03.488
(shouts)

42:03.521 --> 42:06.824
(cries)

42:06.858 --> 42:09.994
* For years *

42:10.027 --> 42:12.897
* And I will brave *

42:12.930 --> 42:15.700
* Your flood *

42:15.733 --> 42:20.705
* To breathe... *

42:47.265 --> 42:50.402
Hello, Dawn.
