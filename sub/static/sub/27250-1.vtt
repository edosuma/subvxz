Great! Um... Hey,
could you do me a favor, Sis?

-What kind of favor?
-Marshmallows.

-Marshmallows?
-Jen's family,

while they decorate, so...

a little bit of home--

some nutmeg and some cream.

-Oh! And some hot chocolate.
-All right!

You're back.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.340
You don't even like
marshmallows.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.124
I like them
on sweet potato pie,

his new fiancée,

going home empty-handed.

Well, you better
get back in there,

every embarrassing
childhood memory.

-Uh... Too late.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.082
Will shoved his whole face
into the mold,

05:00.256 --> 05:02.432
so instead of a cute hand
print in plaster,

05:02.606 --> 05:04.478
we got a cute nose print
for Christmas.

-Ahh, there's my little girl!
-Oh, hey, Daddy!

-Oh, how was the drive?
-Uh, long! I'm just so happy
to finally be here.

you all since last Christmas.

-Hey! [chuckles]

-Let me see it.
-[gasps] It's official.

05:28.937 --> 05:32.114

on social media, but this...

05:32.288 --> 05:36.553
is so much prettier in person.

your bags from the car,

and then this guy is making
hot chocolate for everyone.

-Is he?

Don't make your old man
do all the work, come on.

Right behind you, Pop.

OK, sit down, I need
more details.

-A gift.

for another week.

I can't wait to see it
on your door at the clinic.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.639
I always hoped that,
before I retired,

07:02.813 --> 07:07.992
you and I would get
to work side by side,
and now, here you are.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.126
Well, losing Mom put a lot
of things in perspective.

07:11.300 --> 07:16.914
After I finished my residency,
I knew that I wanted to start
a new chapter back home.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.874
Besides, I wanted to learn
from the best.

07:20.048 --> 07:24.487
[laughs] Well, I'm sure
we'll each teach each other
a thing or two.

07:24.661 --> 07:25.706

07:25.880 --> 07:27.621
Thank you, Daddy.

-I think that'll look
really good.
-Mm-hmm.

You really didn't have to
do this just for me.

for you.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.893

07:39.067 --> 07:40.808
Plus, we all benefit,
trust me.

all the credit.

the supplies.

Well, that was
very thoughtful
of both of you.

to see it.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.045
Years of memories
in those pages.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.700
Our mom used to put on the
nativity every Christmas Eve.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.920
The kids would
play the characters,
we had live animals,

08:06.094 --> 08:08.444
we were the only
nativity around
that had a live camel.

three years in a row.

-Son, there is no
head shepherd.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.798
Agree to disagree, Pop.

[Peter and Jen chuckle]

08:17.453 --> 08:19.411
I can't believe
she kept all this.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.112
So, what happened
to the nativity?

08:24.286 --> 08:27.855
They haven't put it on
in years, Mom was
the driving force behind it.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.726
When she got sick,
they tried to change things up.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.859
They had a variety show,
a Christmas carnival, but...

08:32.033 --> 08:33.904
it was just never the same.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.602
That's why
I'm bringing it back.

08:36.777 --> 08:37.821
Really?

08:37.995 --> 08:39.780
Hm! Now that I'm home,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.782
I thought the tradition
should go on.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.566
When were you
gonna tell me this?

08:43.740 --> 08:45.655
I talked to Pastor Louis,
he loves the idea.

08:45.829 --> 08:46.961
Oh, good.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.658
If you need any help,
count me in.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.269
-Yeah, me too.
-Oh, you're all helping!

08:51.443 --> 08:52.619
-[chuckles]
-I just...

08:52.793 --> 08:54.446
I don't think
the shepherd costume

08:54.621 --> 08:55.839
is going to fit you well.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.972
Ha ha. Very funny.

08:58.146 --> 09:01.715
I'm really excited.
There's some big shoes to fill,
but, uh,

09:01.889 --> 09:03.891
I hope I can do Mom justice.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.632
Nobody better for the job.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.764
Thanks, Daddy.

one of my favorites!

in the attic!

09:23.737 --> 09:24.955
These are
the nativity costumes,

09:25.129 --> 09:27.784
Mom sowed all of these
herself.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.832
-Aw.
-Oh! And I remember
wearing this one.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.835
Oh, no! It has holes in it.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.967

Oh, are they all like that?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.274
Looks like it.
The kids can't wear these.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.885
No, wait, you should be able
to patch these up.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.408
You think?

Call Polly.
She was always good at that.

Ah! I can't wait.

Give us a round of applause,
please, for our young little

much of a clapper,
always loved a good whistle.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.625

I'm trying to teach Will,
he just never picked it up.

in town. Let's celebrate!
-Yeah, let's go out!

12:11.339 --> 12:13.733
What exactly
do you have in mind?

12:17.432 --> 12:18.955
[Will]
To my amazing sister,
thank you.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.870
From embracing Jen
like she's family,

12:21.044 --> 12:23.003
to keeping
our mother's spirit alive,

12:23.177 --> 12:25.222
you will always be
smarter than me,
but never better looking.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.528
Oh, hey, now!

12:26.702 --> 12:29.226
-[Will chuckles]
-Cheers!

12:31.228 --> 12:32.752
-Hmm!
-Ah.

12:35.276 --> 12:38.061
So how do you really feel
about Dad's mystery woman?

12:38.235 --> 12:39.541
I'm OK with it.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.847
Well, it doesn't
bother you that he's

12:41.021 --> 12:42.413
bringing her tomorrow?

12:42.587 --> 12:44.546
-Does it bother you?
-Oh, it's just that...

12:44.720 --> 12:46.766
the farm was always
a family thing.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.680
[Jen] Noelle?

12:48.855 --> 12:52.119
-Cute guy, over by
the pool table. Red shirt.
-Oh, no.

12:54.817 --> 12:55.905
You ready to lose 20 dollars?

12:56.079 --> 12:57.777
What, you know him?

12:57.951 --> 13:00.997
Well, um... I dated him.

13:01.171 --> 13:04.218
[Noelle] Well, there's
more than that, we were
high school sweethearts.

13:04.392 --> 13:08.222
-[Jen] Oh...
-Nick and Noelle were
prom king and queen.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.266
Was not!

13:09.440 --> 13:11.138
Just homecoming.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.140
They were supposed to go
to college together,

13:13.314 --> 13:17.144
but then Nick got drafted,
chose baseball instead.

13:17.318 --> 13:21.278
Yep. I tried, he didn't.

13:21.452 --> 13:25.021
Daily phone calls turned into
weekly phone calls,
turned into no phone calls.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.936
Oh...

13:27.110 --> 13:30.635
[grunts]
Ancient history.
I've moved on.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.160
That's good, because
he's headed this way.

13:34.596 --> 13:35.727
Well, well, well.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.207
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns

13:37.381 --> 13:39.079
in all the world,
she walks into mine.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.516
You don't own the place,
Nick.

13:41.690 --> 13:44.911
Uh... Actually, I do.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.522
My mom and I bought it
six months ago.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.133
-What happened to Mister Joe?
-He retired.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.135
Do you guys need a fourth?
We could play teams.

13:52.309 --> 13:56.139
Oh. No, I'm fine on my own.

13:56.313 --> 13:59.621
A little birdie told me
that you were back in town
for good. Is that true?

14:00.317 --> 14:01.188
It is.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.667
But don't worry,

14:02.842 --> 14:05.061
I'll find another gin joint.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.324
Legends is all yours.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.023
Since when did you become
such a good shot?

14:10.197 --> 14:11.851
A lot can change
in ten years, Nick.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.608
[chuckles]

14:50.367 --> 14:53.066
-[Noelle] Good morning.
-[both] Morning!

14:53.240 --> 14:55.111
Is something burning?

14:55.285 --> 14:58.201
Hmm, just Dasher, Dancer
and Prancer.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.073
Donner and Blitzen
managed to survive.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.030
[chuckles]

15:01.204 --> 15:02.727
Will made me reindeer pancakes.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.469
Oh, i-is that supposed to be
a reindeer?

15:05.643 --> 15:07.689
The antlers are tricky.

15:07.863 --> 15:11.649
-[Jen] Aww. It's the thought
that counts.
-[Noelle] Hm!

15:11.823 --> 15:13.738
So... Last night was fun.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.436
My head is still spinning.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.829
You had to know you'd run
into him at some point.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.005
[doorbell rings]

15:19.179 --> 15:20.963
She's here.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.749
[doorbell rings again]

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
[Peter]
Coming!

15:29.319 --> 15:31.234
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:33.802 --> 15:36.065
Uh, you remember Mary Russell
from church.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.371
Hi.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.329
-[Jen and Noelle] Hi.
-[Will] Hi.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.592
And, of course, her son.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.031
Nick.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.380
Hi.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.212
Well, this is fun.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.524
[sighs] Mary had mentioned
that she needed
some more decorations

16:00.698 --> 16:03.484
for sprucing up Legends,
so I invited her along.

16:03.658 --> 16:07.270
A-and I wanted to say thank
you for letting us tag along,
so I made this gingerbread.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.359
I know it's one
of your favorites,
Noelle.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.970
Thank you, Mrs. Russell.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.797
Oh, no, no. No, please.
Call me Mary.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.930
That's very sweet of you.

16:15.104 --> 16:18.325
And this is my soon-to-be
daughter-in-law, Jen.

16:18.499 --> 16:21.545
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.547
Uh, why don't we find
a place for that
in the kitchen.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.853
Yeah, sure.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.118
Umm...

16:30.902 --> 16:33.122
-Gingerbread!
-Yeah.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.302
Did you know about this
last night?

16:39.476 --> 16:42.697
I-I knew we were going
to the fair, but I didn't know
it was with you.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.351
Right.

16:44.525 --> 16:48.007
If you want me to leave...

16:48.181 --> 16:49.834
No, we're adults, Nick.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.272
We can get through the holidays
without it being a thing.

16:52.446 --> 16:53.360
I agree.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.971
-Good.
-Good.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.146
Good.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.584
Great.

17:00.758 --> 17:03.631
I haven't been
to the Christmas fair
as a guest in years,

17:03.805 --> 17:05.198
I'm usually working at it.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.502
Think Noelle was OK with this?

17:06.676 --> 17:08.417
Oh, she was all for it.
How about Nick?

17:08.592 --> 17:10.986
Oh, he didn't know
until we pulled into
your driveway.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.337
-Let me get that for you.
-Thank you.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.685
And let me get that
for you.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.123
Oh, thank you!

17:17.297 --> 17:18.689
[Jen chuckles]

17:18.863 --> 17:22.345
[Peter] All right everybody,
let's do this!

17:22.519 --> 17:24.694
Oh, I think we can make room.
Here, we'll squish.

17:24.868 --> 17:27.349
-Looks a little tight.
-We can take my truck.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.135
If I know my mom, she'll bring
back a haul.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.485
-You OK with that, Noelle?
-Sure.

17:31.659 --> 17:34.009
All right, why don't you
follow us, then.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.013
I control the radio.

17:38.187 --> 17:39.406
Just like old times.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.076
[slow rock playing on radio]

18:00.166 --> 18:01.515
I've always loved this song.

18:06.215 --> 18:09.218
-[changes station]
-[chuckles]

18:09.392 --> 18:12.178
OK. I walked myself
right into that one.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.441
[chuckles]

18:14.615 --> 18:16.660
So, are you happy to be home?

18:16.834 --> 18:19.098
Yeah. You know...

18:19.272 --> 18:22.405
Chicago is nice, but
I always knew I'd end up
back here, eventually.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.408
-In this truck, with me?
-No. Not that part.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.584
Hey, we had some pretty good
memories in this truck.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.804
Remember that time
we were driving down
to the beach

18:29.978 --> 18:31.545
and we got pulled over?

18:31.719 --> 18:32.937
And we had to talk ourselves
out of a ticket.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.678
Wait, we?

18:34.852 --> 18:36.767
No, I distinctly remember
I got us out of that ticket.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.118
What do you mean, "I"?
It was a team effort.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.424
No, you were freaking out!

18:41.598 --> 18:43.034
I was not--
I was not freaking out.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.862
Oh! You-you were.
I mean you were shaking.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.343
I-I might have been nervous.
You were crying.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.607
Yes, to get us out
of the ticket.

18:50.781 --> 18:56.396
-All right, the waterworks
might have sealed the deal.
-Worked every time!

18:56.570 --> 18:58.702
See, this truck's been
pretty good to us.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.668
[engine whirrs]

19:17.243 --> 19:18.157
[goat bleats]

19:19.680 --> 19:20.507
[camel grunts]

19:22.291 --> 19:23.858
[ducks quack]

19:40.918 --> 19:43.486
[Noelle]
Ah, my favorite time of year!
Ooh!

19:43.660 --> 19:45.401
-Wow, this is amazing.
-[Noelle] Oh!

19:45.575 --> 19:48.317
Well, what we lack in winter,
we make up for in wonderland.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.189
You really do!

19:50.363 --> 19:51.668
So what do we do first?

19:51.842 --> 19:54.367
How about we head outside,
play a few games?

19:54.541 --> 19:55.759
Little friendly competition.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.500
Uh, well, we always start
with the hayride

19:57.674 --> 20:00.199
-before it gets too busy.
-That sounds like fun.

20:00.373 --> 20:03.550
Hayride it is, then.
Why don't you lead the way?

20:03.724 --> 20:06.292
-[Jen] Oh! The hay were meshed.
-[Will] I know.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.337
[Jen] I loved it.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.600
They might have some more room
on the back.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.037
[Noelle]
Ooh, Dad, let's get
our usual spots.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.169
Come on, come on, come on!

20:14.343 --> 20:16.693
[Peter] Yes, yes.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.566
[Jen]
I feel like a kid, too.
I've only ever done this...

20:19.740 --> 20:21.132
[Mary]
Thank you.

20:21.307 --> 20:24.614
[chatter]

20:24.788 --> 20:25.833
[Nick]
Excuse me.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.052
Oh.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.229
OK, I'm beginning to think
you're doing this on purpose.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.143
I saw an opening.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.624
[driver]
Hold on, it may get bumpy
back there!

20:34.798 --> 20:37.671
Oh! Don't worry.
I got you.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.247
[Jen]
That was so much fun.
Ah, this place is incredible.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.378
I knew you'd love it.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.728
OK, what's next?

20:51.902 --> 20:54.688
I promised Jen we'd pick up
some local ornaments
for her family.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.517
Ooh! You can't go wrong
with the alligator
with the Santa hat.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.041
-The alligator...?
-With the Santa hat.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.261
-Are you kidding me?
-No!

21:02.435 --> 21:04.611
Then you can get the...
decorations you wanted to get.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.831
Yes, but not before I beat you
at the wreath toss.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.355
-Really?
-Yes.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.965
Oh, it's on.

21:11.139 --> 21:13.097
-Nick, Noelle?
-Oh no, you guys
go right ahead,

21:13.272 --> 21:14.708
I've gotta go over to
the animal pen first.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.014
-We're gonna feed the goats.
-OK.

21:19.365 --> 21:22.150
Hm. I don't recall
inviting you.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.935
It was implied.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.285
Come on.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.943
[attendant] All right, whoever
can toss the most balls through
the ring in 20 seconds wins.

21:33.117 --> 21:35.206
You gotta keep your toes
behind the line.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.339
-Are you ready?
-Mm-hmm.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.515
-You are going down.
-Oh, challenge accepted.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.649
[attendant]
Go!

21:42.823 --> 21:45.652
[grunts]
It's harder than it looks.
Toes behind the line!

21:45.826 --> 21:48.394
Hey, worry about
your own ring,
don't think about me.

21:48.568 --> 21:52.049
-Oh, sorry.
-What exactly
are you aiming at?

21:52.223 --> 21:53.268
Five seconds!

21:53.442 --> 21:55.488
Five, four,

21:55.662 --> 21:58.969
three, two, one, time's up!

21:59.143 --> 22:02.364
Woo! I think I came on,
out there, at the end.

22:02.538 --> 22:03.887
[laughs]

22:04.061 --> 22:05.628
I think you beat me by a mile.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.543
Oh, no, I would just say
the same thing.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.502
Hey! It looks like
we have a tie!

22:09.676 --> 22:13.114
-Ooh!
-Can you believe that?

22:13.288 --> 22:16.117
I'll let the happy couple
decide who gets to
take home the prize.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.294
-Oh! Uh, we're not a thin--
-Thing. Even so...

22:19.468 --> 22:21.427
You know, I'll take it,
then I'll, uh, you take it.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.777
-Aw, thank you.
-You really want it.

22:23.951 --> 22:27.737
-We should get your decorations
and find the kids.
-Yeah. Sounds good.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.783
I had no idea you had
that good an arm.

22:29.957 --> 22:32.568
Oh, yeah. Well,
where do you think
Nick gets it from?

22:32.742 --> 22:35.571
Oh! Look, he's coming over
for more.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.707
-I think the goat likes me.
-Aw, he's cute.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.839
-You got the list?
-Oh, yes.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.625
We are keeping the roster
light this year, Andy,

22:45.799 --> 22:50.020
so, all I'm looking for is
a couple sheeps, a donkey,
if you can swing it,

22:50.194 --> 22:52.458
and the camel, of course.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.373
You're bringing back
the nativity?

22:54.547 --> 22:56.157
Yes, that's the plan.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.898
Now, if ya'll like,
I can throw in Delilah here,

22:58.072 --> 22:59.769
she is a real crowd pleaser.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.989
Uh, was there a pig
at the manger?

23:02.163 --> 23:03.817
It's called artistic license,
son.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.601
You know, I think
we're just gonna stick

23:05.775 --> 23:07.560
with the source material,
this time, OK?

23:07.734 --> 23:08.735
You the boss, Doc.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.128
Hey, check this out.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.391
Give me your hand.

23:15.263 --> 23:16.525
[Noelle]
Aww.

23:16.699 --> 23:20.355
Oh, hi! Oh, you are...

23:20.529 --> 23:21.878
[Will] You have to try to
catch a chicken.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.054
Aw, you and soft bunny.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.668
So, how'd you do?
Find anything nice?

23:28.842 --> 23:31.975
-Well, there were so many
to choose from.
-So she bought all of them.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.848
-[gasps] Attagirl!
-Yeah, I thought
you'd like that.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.503
So, um...
Where's nick?

23:38.721 --> 23:40.114
Oh, uh, he's...

23:40.288 --> 23:42.638
with his adoring public.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.988
Nick, he used to play
in the Majors, he's a...

23:45.162 --> 23:46.729
bit of a hometown hero.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.819
What do you mean by
"used to play"?

23:49.993 --> 23:51.299
He hurt his shoulder
this spring.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.170
He lives here now.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.218
You didn't know that.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.742
-Ah! There they are.
-I hope we didn't keep you all
waiting.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.352
[Jen]
Oh!

24:01.527 --> 24:03.659
Wow, you guys really
cleared 'em out!

24:03.833 --> 24:07.881
The wreaths are mine.
The Christmas spirit
was contagious.

24:08.055 --> 24:10.231
-So, we all ready to head out?
-Sure.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.190
Actually, there's one more thing
that we need to do.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.977
Southern snowman!

24:17.151 --> 24:21.024
Wh--? I have made plenty
of snowmen in my life,
but none without snow.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.373
[Will]
Here's your chance, then.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.027
Mom, Dad, Will and I
would pair off

24:24.201 --> 24:26.029
for a little friendly
competition.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.902
Except, with Noelle,
the friendly part
was very optional.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.557
OK, OK. I can be
a little bit competitive.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.776
A little?

24:33.950 --> 24:36.649
And the best part is
the losers buy the winners
spiced cider.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.042
Well, I am not buying.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.783
Let's see about that.

24:40.957 --> 24:44.918
So, are you ready
to defend our title,
partner?

24:45.092 --> 24:47.834
I was thinking because
it's Jen's first time,
she and I would partner up,

24:48.008 --> 24:49.618
-and we're engaged, so--
-Yeah, of course.

24:49.792 --> 24:50.663
-Sorry, sis.
-Yes!

24:50.837 --> 24:53.492
Gosh, duh!
No, I-- Dad?

24:54.362 --> 24:55.494
[laughs]

24:56.582 --> 24:58.322
Oh...

24:58.497 --> 25:00.977
All right, then.
What do you say
we kick a little tail?

25:04.111 --> 25:04.851
Let's do it.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.330
Oh, we're gonna--

25:06.505 --> 25:08.376
[Nick]
Uh, we're gonna need the paint.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.334
-We're gonna need the paint.
-You're cute.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.555
Knit up. Don't let him
steal anything.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.478
What if we do like, uh...

25:45.848 --> 25:46.806
[Will]
Come on, Randy.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.068
Now this is just my opinion,

25:48.242 --> 25:49.852
they all have fine qualities.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.550
Drop the hammer, Randy.

25:53.073 --> 25:53.856
Number three.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.597
-Come on!
-[cheers]

25:58.469 --> 26:00.733
Randy, look!

26:00.907 --> 26:01.821
There's gotta be a winner!

26:01.995 --> 26:03.257
All right.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.738
Oh, I will take that
large cider,

26:05.912 --> 26:06.869
and don't skimp
on the spice.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.218
Better make it two.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.220
[Noelle giggles]

26:10.394 --> 26:11.744
Nice work!

26:11.918 --> 26:12.919
[sighs]

26:13.093 --> 26:15.748
We always did make
a pretty good team.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.315
Yeah, we did.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.585
-I still think ours is better.
-Right?

26:35.985 --> 26:37.987
What are you doing?
It doesn't go there.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.946
Where else would you put it?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.165
At the front door.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.993
You buy wreath to enjoy it.
What better place to enjoy it

26:44.167 --> 26:46.039
than in the comfort
of your living room?

26:46.213 --> 26:48.694
No. You buy a wreath
to welcome people.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.870
To welcome them
at your front door.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.263
Hm. Well, good thing
you bought two.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.839
Hey, w-wait. You have
two doors, you're gonna
need both wreaths.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.626
Dad?

27:07.800 --> 27:08.931
-Noelle...
-Mom?

27:09.105 --> 27:10.193
Nick...

27:12.543 --> 27:13.849
-What was that?
-I have no idea.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.938
This is not
what it looked like.

27:16.112 --> 27:18.593
Really? 'Cause it looked
like you two were kissing.

27:18.767 --> 27:21.727
-[Will] W-what?
-We were kissing but we wer--
it wasn't kissing.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.859
-Th-there was mistletoe...
-Yes!

27:24.033 --> 27:26.079
Who put mistletoe up
in the house?

27:26.253 --> 27:28.690
That was me, but that's not
how I saw that playing out.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.823
It was just in good fun.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.564
You know what, uh,
let's just take a breath
for a second,

27:33.739 --> 27:37.264
and, uh, why- why don't I call
and order some food,
we'll have dinner together.

27:37.438 --> 27:39.919
[Mary]
You know what, um,
we really have to get going,

27:40.093 --> 27:42.051
I've gotta stop at Legends
on the way home.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.793
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Thank you so much
for letting us tag along.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.015
-Good night.
-Good night.

27:49.189 --> 27:53.367
Um... Good night, Dr. Collins,
good night.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.156
So, you...

28:00.330 --> 28:03.638
like Mrs. Russell.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.989
Mary. And yeah.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.035
I do... Quite a bit.

28:09.209 --> 28:13.996
-Aww.
-So, the kiss was not just
a holiday formality.

28:14.170 --> 28:17.043
Not exactly, no.

28:17.217 --> 28:23.179
We've been... spending
a lot of time together,
and we've grown very close.

28:23.353 --> 28:29.272
In fact, I was thinking
about asking her out
on a proper date.

28:29.446 --> 28:30.926
That's great, Dad.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.973
You should.
You deserve to be happy.

28:36.192 --> 28:39.282
Well... You could have given me
a heads up.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.591
Or even more of a heads up.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.682
[sighs]

28:48.857 --> 28:50.163
OK...

28:52.687 --> 28:55.037
Ah, perfect!

28:56.517 --> 28:58.867
OK, nicely done.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.228
I'm just gonna take this down.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.198
[Will] But I don't know, maybe
you should ask Noelle.

29:25.372 --> 29:29.158
-Ask Noelle what?
-Dad's looking for
date night suggestions.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.073
-Wow.
-I haven't asked her yet.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.989
I just... wanna make sure
that she feels special

29:34.163 --> 29:37.036
I-I don't think
Mary's dated much
since her divorce.

29:37.210 --> 29:40.213
Well, what does Mary like?
What's she into?

29:40.387 --> 29:44.870
Well, she loves to cook.
She sings in the choir
at church.

29:45.044 --> 29:50.353
Um... She loves old movies
and she's a sucker
for a good steak.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.051
Mary sounds awesome!

29:52.225 --> 29:54.053
Why don't you take her
to that local chophouse

29:54.227 --> 29:55.445
on the west side of town.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.099
Ah, I don't think
I could get a reservation

29:57.273 --> 29:57.926
over the holidays.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.798
Oh, what about a picnic?

29:59.972 --> 30:01.451
It's simple and romantic,

30:01.625 --> 30:03.932
and you could do it
just about anywhere.

30:04.106 --> 30:07.588
Now, that is a great idea.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.242
All right, I am off.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.373
I've gotta go
to the clinic today

30:10.547 --> 30:12.375
but after that I'm all yours.

30:12.549 --> 30:15.248
-Good luck with
your first rehearsal.
-Aw, thanks, Dad.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.468
And you know what?

30:18.642 --> 30:21.384
On that note,
I am going to be late,

30:21.558 --> 30:25.084
so, remember, we are meeting
Pastor Louis at the church.
Got it?

30:25.258 --> 30:27.782
-We'll be there.
-[Jen] See ya.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.526
-OK, everyone ready?
-[all] Yes, Coach!

30:32.700 --> 30:33.919
All right,
take your positions.

30:34.093 --> 30:36.443
-[kids chatter]
-OK, Charlie.

30:36.617 --> 30:39.533
This one's coming to you.
Remember, there's a runner
on first and second.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.404
I'm gonna do a double play,
Coach.

30:41.578 --> 30:44.146
Oh! I like it. All right,
show 'em what you got.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.844
[kids chatter]

30:47.628 --> 30:48.847
[kid]
I'm coming!

30:54.809 --> 30:56.289
[woman]
Noelle! Over here.

30:56.463 --> 31:00.815
[Noelle] Oh. Hey, Polly!
It is so good to see you.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.296
Good to see you too.
I'm sorry to have you
meet me here,

31:03.470 --> 31:05.733
my son is doing
this baseball clinic
for the next few days.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.431
I figured you'd wanna talk
sooner rather than later.

31:08.605 --> 31:11.434
Oh, please.
I am just so grateful
that you reached out,

31:11.608 --> 31:14.481
and you are doing me the favor
for these costumes.

31:14.655 --> 31:17.440
You know, I remember one year,
your mom made me
the star of Bethlehem,

31:17.614 --> 31:20.008
and I refused to say
a single word the entire day.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.749
I was determined to stay
in character.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.839
I think I remember that.

31:25.013 --> 31:29.278
Hey, um...
Is Nick Russell
running the clinic?

31:29.452 --> 31:31.280
-There you go.
-[kid] Play second,
play second.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.542
Play one, play one,
play one.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.414
Nick is the whole reason
the kids are here.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.633
He sponsors one of
our little league teams, too.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.288
You know, he could have just
slapped his name on it,

31:39.462 --> 31:41.421
but the whole season
he was out there with the boys
every week.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.118
All right, guys.
Bring it in, bring it in!

31:43.292 --> 31:44.815
[Polly]
They really look up to him.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.427
[Nick]
There we are.
High fives!

31:47.601 --> 31:49.516
Yeah, I can see that.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.779
-[Nick] Good hustle, guys!
-[Polly] Let's talk fabric.

31:51.953 --> 31:56.479
So I'm thinking, for Mary,
something like this.
This for Joseph.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.313
So we have a little hiccup
with the costumes,

32:04.487 --> 32:08.013
but what I really
can't wait for is
for the kids to get here.

32:08.187 --> 32:12.060
Noelle and Will Collins.
Well, this sure is a treat.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.976
Pastor Louis, it is
so great to see you.

32:15.150 --> 32:18.327
I remember the two of you
being in Sunday school
like it was yesterday,

32:18.501 --> 32:19.546
-and now look at ya.
-[both chuckle]

32:19.720 --> 32:21.156
Dr. Collins.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.854
-And you! An engaged man.
-Yes, sir.

32:24.029 --> 32:28.033
-This is Jen.
-Aw, so nice to finally
put a face to the name.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.209
Pleasure is mine,
young lady.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.298
Noelle, I can't tell you
how excited we are

32:32.472 --> 32:35.344
that you are bringing back
your mom's beloved tradition.

32:35.518 --> 32:37.042
It's gonna be
something special.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.131
I hope so.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.090
Here are the keys.
Gets you in anywhere
you need to go.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.092
If you need anything else,
let me know.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.616
Thank you.
Now, if you could just point us
in the direction

32:46.790 --> 32:50.272
of the props,
that would be great.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.841
Oh, uh...
So, nobody told you.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.452
Told us what?

32:59.281 --> 33:01.762
-[Jen] Oh...
-[Noelle] What happened?

33:01.936 --> 33:04.373
Well, nobody's used it
in a really long time,
now, and...

33:04.547 --> 33:07.898
We've had some problems
with some leaky pipes, and...

33:08.073 --> 33:10.858
I'm afraid not much
has survived.

33:13.469 --> 33:16.603
Oh, no. The myrrh.

33:16.777 --> 33:19.519
Hey! Don't let this
get you down.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.477
We can make more, right?

33:21.651 --> 33:24.567
Well, this is gonna
put us behind.

33:24.741 --> 33:26.656
I'm a wiz with the glue gun!

33:26.830 --> 33:29.137
I am not, but I do have
a great attitude.

33:29.311 --> 33:33.098
[chuckles]

33:33.272 --> 33:38.886
So we've got moth-eaten
costumes, no props or set...
and a show in four days.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.584
Well, it can only go up
from here, right?

33:41.758 --> 33:43.586
You know what? Um, hey!

33:43.760 --> 33:46.111
Would you guys mind
going back inside and,
I don't know,

33:46.285 --> 33:48.722
getting a jump on repairing
the damage?

33:48.896 --> 33:52.378
-Sure. What about rehearsal?
-I can run it solo.

33:52.552 --> 33:55.642
-With all those kids?
-Are you sure about that, Sis?

33:55.816 --> 33:58.906
I'll be fine.
I can totally
handle it.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.951
Good luck.

34:01.126 --> 34:04.825
[children chattering, yelling]

34:11.614 --> 34:16.619
[loudly] Uh, All right,
everyone, uh, I'd like to grab
your attention, pl-

34:16.793 --> 34:19.927
[Noelle]
Uh, OK, hi, everyone.
Right here, um...

34:20.101 --> 34:21.275
Please, just settle...

34:24.105 --> 34:24.975
Um--

34:25.150 --> 34:26.194
[blows whistle]

34:32.766 --> 34:34.246
They're all yours.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.552
Wh-what are you doing here?

34:36.726 --> 34:39.251
I heard some of my kids
were in the show.
Thought I'd stop by.

34:39.425 --> 34:43.994
I brought cookies.
Gingerbread.

34:44.168 --> 34:48.347
All right, uh, everyone
to the front, please.
Yep, you too.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.523
OK, everyone,
take a look at your marks.

34:50.697 --> 34:53.656
These are our final positions.
Look at who our buddies are.

34:53.830 --> 34:57.094
All right, now, let's try it
again we're gonna go offstage,
OK, everybody? Exit.

34:57.269 --> 35:01.316
Yep, you guys go that way,
all right, yup, that way.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.624
Angel Gabriel, come on out.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.369
All right, Mary and Joseph,
your turn.

35:10.543 --> 35:13.633
[Nick]
OK, you're the three wise men,
Bethlehem's best and brightest,

35:13.807 --> 35:16.114
you got the gifts,
and it's your job
to get 'em there.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.725
Now it's a tough road ahead,
you got the sand, snakes,

35:18.899 --> 35:21.728
so put on your game face,
and follow that star. Got it?

35:21.902 --> 35:25.079
Good, right here.
Boom. Boom. Boom.

35:26.820 --> 35:27.821
[whispers]
OK.

35:34.958 --> 35:38.788
Do I get to ride a donkey?
In the story, Mary rides in
on a donkey.

35:38.962 --> 35:43.315
Well, in our story, Mary walks.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.839
You know what, I think this is
a perfect time for a break,

35:46.013 --> 35:48.146
um, how about five minutes,
let's go have some snacks.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.279
Oh, careful, everybody careful.
Ah, there you go.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.891
Can I be the drummer boy?

35:55.065 --> 35:58.982
I bet the cow has a snare drum,
he's in a punk band.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.638
Well, there wasn't
a drummer boy
in the nativity.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.946
It's in the song .

36:06.120 --> 36:07.208
I'll think about it.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.384
Then I don't wanna do it
anymore.

36:09.558 --> 36:12.953
-W-wait, you don't wanna be
in the show anymore?
-No!

36:13.127 --> 36:14.563
What's up, Chuck?

36:14.737 --> 36:16.696
She made me an angel,
Coach!

36:16.870 --> 36:20.613
Well, not just any angel.
Angel Gabriel.

36:20.787 --> 36:25.052
Oh, yeah? That's--
that's a very big role.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.836
Yeah!
Did you know that

36:27.010 --> 36:28.360
Nick was actually
the Angel Gabriel

36:28.534 --> 36:30.275
when he was in the nativity.

36:30.449 --> 36:31.450
Really?

36:33.278 --> 36:34.801
I... was.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.630
Hm? He's a head angel,
he calls all the shots.

36:37.804 --> 36:41.199
He's like...
uh, like the MVP of the angels.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.288
Cool!

36:47.379 --> 36:48.336
I was the shepherd.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.904
Oh, I remember.

36:59.565 --> 37:03.133
Mmm! These cookies are
delicious. Who brought these?

37:05.527 --> 37:07.355
Same time tomorrow?

37:07.529 --> 37:10.750
-You bringing the snacks?
-You got it.

37:10.924 --> 37:15.145
Hey, when were you gonna
tell me that you live here now?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.366
Thought you already knew.
My life isn't exactly private.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.803
Well, it's not like I've been
spending my time

37:20.977 --> 37:24.590
researching you
on the internet.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.941
I may have looked you up,
once or twice.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.248
Really?

37:35.644 --> 37:37.255
Have a good night,
Noelle.

37:47.177 --> 37:51.269
[typing on keyboard]

37:52.966 --> 37:54.141
[clicks]

38:13.508 --> 38:16.598
[Jen] Wow, these wise men props
are turning out great.

38:16.772 --> 38:20.689
I've always seen myself
as more of an idea guy,
but I am nailing this.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.387
-Yeah, you are.
-[phone chimes]

38:22.561 --> 38:23.736
Oh.

38:25.694 --> 38:27.957
-[chuckles]
-Who's that?

38:28.131 --> 38:29.742
My dad just sent me
these pictures.

38:29.916 --> 38:31.874
They just got back
from playing in the snow.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.528
That looks like a lot of fun.

38:33.702 --> 38:36.705
Yeah, it is. We go skiing
and sledding,

38:36.879 --> 38:39.621
and then it always ends up
in this epic snowball fight.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.015
My dad and I are on a bit
of a winning streak.

38:42.189 --> 38:46.367
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.501
Well, aren't you two
the definition of adorable.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.329
State the obvious much?

38:53.069 --> 38:54.636
What is that?

38:54.810 --> 38:57.160
Your mission,
should you choose
to accept it.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.032
[Will]
Flyers.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.512
We need the whole town to know
that we're bringing back

39:00.686 --> 39:02.122
the live nativity, so...

39:02.296 --> 39:04.211
word of mouth is
our best friend.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.082
I think that we should
go out in pajamas,

39:06.256 --> 39:08.476
really get the town talking.
I mean, who could say no
to this,

39:08.650 --> 39:10.260
andthis, and...?

39:10.435 --> 39:12.524
-No!
-No...

39:12.698 --> 39:15.135
-No? All right,
thought I'd try.
-[chuckles]

39:15.309 --> 39:16.876
Are you sure you don't need
help with the kids today?

39:17.050 --> 39:19.052
Actually, uh, Nick is
swinging by to help me.

39:19.226 --> 39:20.706
Oh!

39:20.880 --> 39:22.447
Yeah, I mean he coaches
a lot of the kids,

39:22.621 --> 39:25.058
-so he knows them.
-Yeah, that makes sense.

39:25.232 --> 39:28.235
They have
an established rapport.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.497
We're agreeing with you, Sis.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.064
Yeah, we're not implying...

39:31.238 --> 39:33.066
much.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.460
[scoffs]
All right, anyway.

39:35.634 --> 39:39.028
Remember,
leave no window unflyered.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.378
Done!

39:40.552 --> 39:43.381
OK, time to go change.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.819
You sure we can't stay
in the pajamas? Please?

39:49.038 --> 39:51.693
OK, now you're definitely
spying on me.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.957
I thought I'd bring
my flyers today.

39:55.131 --> 39:56.524
Guess I'm a little late.

39:56.698 --> 39:58.178
Today was a half day.

39:58.352 --> 39:59.658
But I can email
all the parents,

39:59.832 --> 40:01.616
make sure they get
the information.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.837
Oh. Yeah that--
that would be great.

40:05.011 --> 40:07.883
OK, well, um... guess I'll...
see ya at the church.

40:08.057 --> 40:11.191
Oh, no. You're not
getting away that easily.
Come with me.

40:11.365 --> 40:12.845
But I, oh...

40:17.197 --> 40:20.069
So, I need to rehab
my arm a little.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.420
I was gonna throw
into that backstop.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.552
Now, I throw at you.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.728
Wh-- Excuse me,
you're gonna do what?

40:26.902 --> 40:28.556
I'll go easy on you.

40:28.730 --> 40:32.691
Ugh, Nick, this is crazy.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.606
[chuckles]

40:34.780 --> 40:36.608
You'll have fun, I promise.

40:36.782 --> 40:39.480
Hey, here. Just...
All right.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.091
-Make sure to keep
your elbow up.
-Mm-hmm.

40:42.265 --> 40:45.094
And then swing
all the way through.

40:45.268 --> 40:48.446
-All the way through. Got it.
-Good.

40:50.578 --> 40:52.885
OK.

40:53.059 --> 40:55.278
OK, now just keep your eye
on the ball.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.150
Easy for you to say,
you're the pro.

41:03.286 --> 41:06.681
Oh! That was-- that was close,
just a little high. Try again.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.991
Ah! One more. You ready?

41:12.165 --> 41:13.732
Bring it on.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.997
Oh, run! Run!

41:18.171 --> 41:19.999
Wh-Oh! OK.

41:20.173 --> 41:22.784
[both laugh]

41:22.958 --> 41:24.917
Woohoo! Not a move you see
in the Majors.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.614
[laughs]

41:26.788 --> 41:27.963
[screams]

41:28.137 --> 41:29.922
[giggles]

41:30.096 --> 41:31.837
You got some moves, woman!

41:32.011 --> 41:34.796
Yeah,
and don't you forget it.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.495
See you at the church.

41:46.112 --> 41:47.896
[door chimes]

41:48.070 --> 41:49.898
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't open
for a few more hours.

41:50.072 --> 41:52.553
-Oh, well, I can always
come back later.
-Oh, no, no!

41:52.727 --> 41:54.990
You have a standing invitation.
[chuckles]

41:55.164 --> 41:56.818
Can I help you?

41:56.992 --> 41:58.864
Yes, can you hand me
that tub right there, please?

41:59.038 --> 42:02.476
-You bet.
-Thank you.

42:02.650 --> 42:05.827
So, I hear that Nick
is helping Noelle
with the nativity.

42:06.001 --> 42:09.091
-Hm.
-I'm glad to hear they are
mending fences.

42:09.265 --> 42:12.530
I think when you love somebody,
it never really goes away

42:14.444 --> 42:16.795
-Mary?
-Hm?

42:16.969 --> 42:18.840
The real reason I stopped by--

42:19.014 --> 42:22.844
Hey, do you wanna
have dinner sometime?

42:23.018 --> 42:25.107
Oh... Oh, you know what,
never mind. Forg--

42:25.281 --> 42:27.022
No, no. Yes!

42:27.196 --> 42:29.547
Yes. [chuckles]

42:29.721 --> 42:31.549
Tomorrow? Pick you up
around seven?

42:32.332 --> 42:33.681
Seven.

42:33.855 --> 42:35.378
-Good.
-Good.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.643
-More?
-Uh, yeah, down here.
This next one.

42:47.477 --> 42:50.002
[Nick] I picked up donuts.

42:50.176 --> 42:52.526
Even splurged for the red
and green sprinkles.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.094
Aww. That's really sweet.

42:55.268 --> 42:59.011
We need to make
rehearsal marks for the kids,
before they get here.

42:59.185 --> 43:01.970
So, I need three yellow,
and two blue.

43:02.144 --> 43:03.885
Got it.
[clears throat]

43:04.059 --> 43:06.540
So, uh, how'd the clinic
finish up?

43:06.714 --> 43:10.022
Kids had a blast.
I may have had
some fun, too.

43:10.196 --> 43:12.285
-You're really great with them.
-Thanks.

43:12.459 --> 43:16.376
I remember what it was like
to fall in love with the game
at that age.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.944
You ever think about coaching?

43:19.118 --> 43:20.946
What do you mean?

43:21.120 --> 43:23.165
You'd make a really great
coach, now that you're back.

43:23.339 --> 43:25.733
-I know that you were gonn--
-No, I'm not back for good.

43:25.907 --> 43:27.474
Just until my shoulder heals.

43:28.910 --> 43:30.912
Right.

43:31.086 --> 43:33.654
Actually, I was offered
a position at the high school.

43:33.828 --> 43:35.308
It'd be a great job, but...

43:35.482 --> 43:38.050
I'm thinking it would mean
my baseball career is over.

43:38.224 --> 43:41.575
-And I'm not giving up
that easily.
-Yeah. Of course not.

43:45.927 --> 43:46.754
You OK?

43:46.928 --> 43:48.800
Yeah, I just...

43:48.974 --> 43:51.803
I want today
to run smoothly.

43:51.977 --> 43:54.066
Could you grab
the rehearsal props?

43:54.240 --> 43:55.763
I-I think they're in
the hall closet.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.199
Yeah, sure.

44:02.117 --> 44:04.467
[Noelle] "The shepherds and
their sheep reached Bethlehem

44:04.642 --> 44:08.167
and found the baby
in the manger, just as
the angel had told them."

44:10.604 --> 44:11.649
This is great.

44:12.562 --> 44:13.999
Yeah, it is.

44:14.173 --> 44:15.565
You're a miracle worker.

44:15.740 --> 44:18.656
Uh, I don't know
about that but...

44:18.830 --> 44:20.396
we might just pull this off.

44:20.570 --> 44:22.268
[fire alarm]

44:22.442 --> 44:25.097
-Mom!
-[kid] What's happening?

44:25.271 --> 44:28.535
[Nick] OK, everyone just
move slowly and calmly.

44:28.709 --> 44:32.234
Just drop your props and
be sure to grab your parent's
hands on your way out.

44:32.408 --> 44:35.020
-[woman] Stay calm.
You're all right. Follow me.
-[Noelle] Wait.

44:44.464 --> 44:46.684
Thank you, Sean.

44:46.858 --> 44:48.120
[Noelle]
Pastor, is everything OK?

44:48.294 --> 44:50.513
-Well, there was no fire.
-[sighs]

44:50.688 --> 44:52.994
But there was a burst pipe.

44:53.168 --> 44:56.563
-Oh, no.
-Some old roots have been
growing into the main water line

44:56.737 --> 45:00.219
-and chose today
of all days to do us in.
-So, what does that mean?

45:00.393 --> 45:01.916
Unfortunately, it means
that we're gonna have to find

45:02.090 --> 45:03.744
another venue
for the nativity

45:03.918 --> 45:05.746
or we're gonna have to
cancel it altogether.

45:05.920 --> 45:09.968
-The show is in 72 hours.
-I'm sorry, Noelle.

45:10.142 --> 45:12.013
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

45:20.369 --> 45:22.937
We can build a new manger,
but we can't exactly
build a new church.

45:23.111 --> 45:25.026
I mean, this is
a complete disaster.

45:25.200 --> 45:28.247
-Well, look on the bright side.
-Which is?

45:28.421 --> 45:31.380
Oh, I don't know.
But I'm sure there is one,
so we should look at it.

45:31.554 --> 45:33.774
[Peter]
The important thing is
you've got backup.

45:33.948 --> 45:35.994
We'll all pitch in,
and we will give this town

45:36.168 --> 45:38.126
a nativity
they'll always remember.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.390
-Oh, it's already one
that you can never forget!
-[door closes]

45:41.564 --> 45:44.611
[Will] One hundred
and twenty two flyers are
now covering the entire town.

45:44.785 --> 45:46.961
There's no one who doesn't
know about the nativity.

45:47.135 --> 45:49.877
Great. I'll just need you to
go back and pick up 122 flyers

45:50.051 --> 45:51.531
that have the wrong address.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.446
Wait--what happened?

45:53.620 --> 45:55.796
Apparently, the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

45:55.970 --> 46:00.061
-Um, we lost the church.
-No... What can we do?

46:00.235 --> 46:02.977
I was supposed to go over
and help Holly
with the costumes.

46:03.151 --> 46:04.457
Maybe you guys
could head over there?

46:04.631 --> 46:06.328
-Yeah, sure.
-We're on it.

46:06.502 --> 46:07.939
And how about us?

46:08.113 --> 46:09.897
Uh, could you call the parents

46:10.071 --> 46:11.551
and let them know what's
happening, but assure them

46:11.725 --> 46:12.639
that the show is still on?

46:12.813 --> 46:13.771
Absolutely.

46:19.515 --> 46:20.647
How can I help?

46:20.821 --> 46:22.431
Well, now we need
to find a venue.

46:22.605 --> 46:24.042
OK, I'll drive.

46:32.224 --> 46:33.878
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hey.

46:34.052 --> 46:35.705
-Do you rent out your theater?
-We do.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.534
-When would you need it?
-In two days.

46:38.708 --> 46:41.668
I'm sorry. Our sets are still up
for our winter kids show.

46:41.842 --> 46:44.236
Billy Buttons
Barnyard Jamboree.

46:44.410 --> 46:46.020
They'll be up
for a few more weeks.

46:46.194 --> 46:48.457
It was worth a try.
Thank you.

46:48.631 --> 46:50.677
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

46:52.722 --> 46:54.463
Now, what?

46:54.637 --> 46:56.378
What about the high school gym?

46:56.552 --> 46:58.250
I could talk to
the athletic director.
He's a friend.

46:58.424 --> 47:00.339
-A gym?
-Yeah, I know it's not ideal.

47:00.513 --> 47:01.993
But, hey, when there was
no room at the inn,

47:02.167 --> 47:05.039
Mary and Joseph
had to improvise, right?

47:05.213 --> 47:07.955
No room at the inn.
Nick, that's it!

47:08.129 --> 47:09.827
I know where to
have the show. Come on.

47:13.613 --> 47:14.875
[Noelle gasps]

47:15.049 --> 47:17.051
What better place to have
the nativity

47:17.225 --> 47:19.140
than where
it actually took place?

47:19.314 --> 47:23.014
-In a barn!
-Well, technically
it was a stable.

47:23.188 --> 47:24.754
Oh, barn, stable, whatever.

47:24.929 --> 47:28.541
-It's perfect.
-[Randy] Hey.

47:28.715 --> 47:31.892
Nick and Noelle, what brings
you two out here at this hour?

47:32.066 --> 47:34.373
Randy, we really
need your help.

47:34.547 --> 47:37.898
A... a pipe burst
at the church, and now
the nativity may not happen

47:38.072 --> 47:42.163
because we need a place
for their show, so I was
wondering if maybe--

47:42.337 --> 47:43.730
It's all yours.

47:45.645 --> 47:47.342
-Really?
-Yeah.

47:47.516 --> 47:49.562
What better place to have
a nativity than a barn?

47:49.736 --> 47:51.607
That's what I said!

47:51.781 --> 47:54.001
Thank you, Randy. Oh you!

47:54.175 --> 47:55.873
You saved the show.

47:56.047 --> 47:59.354
Well, I think we all know
who saved the show.

47:59.528 --> 48:01.269
Tell you what. I'll get it
cleaned up for you,

48:01.443 --> 48:03.402
and I'll see you guys
in the morning...
bright and early?

48:03.576 --> 48:05.099
Randy, thank you.

48:05.273 --> 48:07.580
-No problem.
-Thank you.

48:09.930 --> 48:12.193
-Oh!
-[Nick chuckles]

48:12.367 --> 48:14.369
We have a venue!

48:14.543 --> 48:17.024
I told you there was
a bright side.

48:17.198 --> 48:18.330
Thank you.

48:20.071 --> 48:22.247
You're welcome, Miss Collins.

48:22.421 --> 48:27.339
-Bright and early tomorrow?
-Yes. And that's...
Dr. Collins to you.

48:28.470 --> 48:29.645
Yes!

49:06.421 --> 49:08.119
I see you found it.

49:08.293 --> 49:09.381
Mm. Grab a fork.

49:09.555 --> 49:10.948
Don't have to
tell me twice.

49:15.039 --> 49:17.519
Mary says that when she
doesn't know what to do
she bakes.

49:17.693 --> 49:20.305
Lucky us. Any luck
finding a venue?

49:20.479 --> 49:23.482
-Randy's letting us
use the barn.
-That's great!

49:23.656 --> 49:26.354
Now I just hope we can get
everything together in time.

49:26.528 --> 49:29.488
If Mom could see us
right now... Ooh...

49:29.662 --> 49:32.621
-She would never let us
eat it out of the pan.
-No!

49:33.709 --> 49:34.493
You know...

49:34.667 --> 49:36.234
I can't ever remember Mom

49:36.408 --> 49:38.671
having all this
thrown on her at once.

49:38.845 --> 49:42.153
I think she would have been
just as freaked out.

49:42.327 --> 49:44.720
You're doing
an amazing job, Sis.

49:44.894 --> 49:47.593
That strangely
makes me feel better.

49:47.767 --> 49:49.290
Well, that's what I'm here for.

49:49.464 --> 49:52.728
Well, that and... the pie.

49:55.470 --> 49:58.256
-[Will] Oh.
-That bite is ridiculous.

49:58.430 --> 50:00.693
I'm gonna take this back.
This is for me.

50:00.867 --> 50:02.956
-You missed some.
-[speaks with full mouth]

50:03.130 --> 50:04.479
[both laugh]

50:09.658 --> 50:13.010
-Fancy meeting you here.
-Good morning.

50:13.184 --> 50:15.795
The word is there's gonna be
a pretty big show here
in a few days.

50:15.969 --> 50:17.362
You know anything about that?

50:17.536 --> 50:19.929
Yeah, you know, I may have
heard something about that.

50:20.104 --> 50:21.409
[chuckles]

50:21.583 --> 50:24.021
So, what should we
do first, Doc?

50:25.935 --> 50:27.546
[Noelle]
OK, just go up on the right.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.505
Going... OK, just a tad more.
OK, yes, perfect!

50:48.523 --> 50:49.350
[Nick] Aha!

50:50.308 --> 50:51.352
Nice work.

51:05.236 --> 51:07.803
[people chattering]

51:09.718 --> 51:10.415
OK, perfect.

51:10.589 --> 51:12.069
Good.

51:13.766 --> 51:15.768
Good. A little bit higher.

51:18.205 --> 51:20.077
All right, guys, last piece.

51:25.299 --> 51:27.171
Wow, Pop, looking sharp.

51:27.345 --> 51:29.347
Thank you. Where are
you guys headed?

51:29.521 --> 51:31.566
Oh, we're just grabbing
dinner. Nothing fancy.

51:31.740 --> 51:33.655
Are you sure you
don't wanna join us, Sis?

51:33.829 --> 51:36.049
-I think the couch
is calling my name.
-[Will] All right.

51:36.223 --> 51:38.225
-But you guys have fun.
-OK. Have a good night.

51:38.399 --> 51:40.009
Thanks.

51:40.184 --> 51:42.447
I noticed that you
forgot the napkins,

51:42.621 --> 51:44.057
so I threw some in there.

51:44.231 --> 51:47.321
What would I do without you?

51:47.495 --> 51:50.716
-Wish me luck.
-You won't need it.

51:50.890 --> 51:54.023
-Have a good night.
-[chuckles] You, too.

51:56.765 --> 51:57.897
[door closes]

51:59.028 --> 52:00.465
[sighs]

52:00.639 --> 52:02.989
[voice on television]
George, darling...

52:03.163 --> 52:06.775
[indistinct dialogue continues]

52:10.127 --> 52:11.258
[knock on door]

52:19.266 --> 52:22.443
-Hi.
-Hi.

52:22.617 --> 52:24.445
What are you doing here?

52:24.619 --> 52:26.230
I thought you might like
some company tonight.

52:26.404 --> 52:27.405
Nice slippers.

52:32.192 --> 52:33.324
What's with the guitar?

52:33.498 --> 52:35.630
We have a finale to rehearse.

52:48.730 --> 52:51.342
-Thank you.
-[Peter] Mm-hmm.

52:51.516 --> 52:54.606
Oh, this park is so pretty
at Christmas time.

52:54.780 --> 52:58.000
Sometimes I drive by,
just so I can
look at the lights.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.437
I thought you might like it.

52:59.611 --> 53:02.701
-You did good.
-[chuckles]

53:02.875 --> 53:05.443
I have to admit, I was
a bit nervous about tonight.

53:06.922 --> 53:09.142
It's just me, Peter.

53:09.316 --> 53:13.712
Exactly. It's you.

53:13.886 --> 53:17.368
I sort of thought this...
chapter of my life was closed,

53:17.542 --> 53:18.412
and I was OK with that.

53:20.153 --> 53:23.069
And then you came along.

53:23.243 --> 53:26.115
We've known each other
practically our entire life.

53:26.290 --> 53:29.597
I know, but I feel like
I'm just getting to know you,

53:29.771 --> 53:33.166
like I get to know something
new every time we're together.

53:34.515 --> 53:36.822
Like...

53:36.996 --> 53:40.478
the time I signed up for
one of those dating apps
a few years ago?

53:40.652 --> 53:42.349
[laughing]

53:42.523 --> 53:45.570
[laughing] You see?
That's my point exactly.

53:45.744 --> 53:49.182
A friend of mine
created the profile for me,

53:49.356 --> 53:51.445
and at first I was angry,
and then I thought,

53:51.619 --> 53:54.100
you know what? What the heck,
I'm gonna give this a try.

53:54.274 --> 53:56.233
Well, it was awful.

53:56.407 --> 53:58.713
[chuckles]
I can't even imagine.

53:58.887 --> 54:03.588
I was checking my phone
incessantly, which is
not like me at all.

54:03.762 --> 54:07.331
Then I bought Legends
and that became my entire life.

54:07.505 --> 54:10.943
And then Nick got hurt,
and all I cared about was
making sure that he was OK.

54:13.250 --> 54:17.602
Who I was...
and what I wanted...

54:17.776 --> 54:19.604
got lost in there somewhere.

54:22.737 --> 54:24.261
But not anymore.

54:27.873 --> 54:32.573
Sometimes second chances
come from the most
unlikely of places.

54:34.096 --> 54:35.272
Yes, they do.

54:47.066 --> 54:49.416
-[Noelle] Careful, that's hot.
-Thank you.

54:49.590 --> 54:53.594
So, have you been thinking
about what our parents
are doing on their date?

54:53.768 --> 54:57.511
No, but... now I am.

54:57.685 --> 55:00.558
Really no surprise your dad
wanted to ask my mom out.

55:00.732 --> 55:03.778
-She's a catch.
-Well, he's got a lot
going for him, too.

55:03.952 --> 55:06.868
I mean, small town doctor,
full head of hair...

55:07.042 --> 55:10.829
I mean, two amazing children,
I mean, he's a triple threat.

55:11.003 --> 55:12.178
Can't argue with that.

55:14.267 --> 55:16.095
I'm really glad
you came over tonight.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.316
I'm here on official...

55:20.839 --> 55:22.101
nativity business.

55:22.797 --> 55:24.277
Uhh.

55:24.451 --> 55:25.844
-You OK?
-Yeah.

55:26.018 --> 55:28.237
Just a friendly little reminder
from my shoulder.

55:28.412 --> 55:31.676
What exactly happened?
Torn rotator cuff?

55:32.633 --> 55:34.069
Yeah.

55:34.243 --> 55:36.855
For a pitcher, it's potentially
a career ender,

55:37.029 --> 55:39.336
-as I'm sure you know.
-What did your doctors say?

55:39.510 --> 55:41.381
A few think I'm out for good.

55:41.555 --> 55:44.210
Some say that
may not be the case.

55:44.384 --> 55:46.343
I wanna believe
it's not the end.

55:48.214 --> 55:49.563
I'm really sorry, Nick.

55:51.086 --> 55:51.913
Thank you.

55:54.655 --> 55:56.265
OK.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.050
Time to practice.

55:58.224 --> 55:59.791
Oh, I don't really
wanna do this.

55:59.965 --> 56:01.793
Oh, that's too bad,
because you've got a show

56:01.967 --> 56:03.534
in two days.

56:03.708 --> 56:05.536
OK, fine.

56:05.710 --> 56:08.539
But I don't want to sing alone.
At least... not tonight.

56:08.713 --> 56:10.802
I'm OK with that.

56:26.600 --> 56:31.039
It's been a long time
since someone's
walked me to my door.

56:31.213 --> 56:34.739
Well... I hope you can
get used to it.

56:34.913 --> 56:36.871
I had a really
nice time tonight.

56:37.698 --> 56:38.525
Me too.

56:44.662 --> 56:46.185
Should I have hung mistletoe?

56:46.359 --> 56:47.752
[giggle]

56:49.231 --> 56:52.278
No. No.

56:52.452 --> 56:54.106
We don't need it.

57:20.959 --> 57:22.134
Good night, Mary.

57:24.266 --> 57:25.398
Good night.

57:38.106 --> 57:39.586
[Will and Jen giggling]

57:39.760 --> 57:41.588
[Jen]
Shh, you're being too loud.

57:41.762 --> 57:42.937
[Will] No, I'm not.

57:44.635 --> 57:45.853
[Jen whispers]
Will! Will!

57:46.027 --> 57:47.899
[indistinct talk on television]

57:48.073 --> 57:51.990
[Will] Well, well, isn't this
an interesting development?

57:52.164 --> 57:54.732
-[Jen] Come on, let them sleep.
-[Will] No, no,
I gotta get a photo.

57:54.906 --> 57:56.690
Will, no.

57:56.864 --> 57:58.649
-They won't know,
it'll be quick.
-No, Will--

57:58.823 --> 58:01.390
-[Jen gasps]
-[camera click]

58:01.565 --> 58:02.479
[Will] Go, go!

58:27.242 --> 58:28.156
[chuckles]

58:31.638 --> 58:33.510
Hey, sweetie, what are you
doing here so early?

58:33.684 --> 58:36.774
Uh, I was out of coffee.
How was your date last night?

58:36.948 --> 58:38.863
Wow,
that sounded really weird.

58:39.037 --> 58:41.953
[laughs] It was lovely,
thank you very much.

58:42.127 --> 58:44.564
-So, will there be another?
-Oh, I hope so.

58:44.738 --> 58:47.785
Oh, so romantic,
there were lights--

58:47.959 --> 58:49.830
-Mm. Well, OK.
-Stars and wine--

58:50.004 --> 58:52.137
Thank you, I don't
need the details.

58:52.311 --> 58:54.705
Hey, you know what,
I forgot to tell you.

58:54.879 --> 58:57.621
I ran into Principal Wilson
at the grocery store.

58:57.795 --> 59:00.014
Oh, yeah?

59:00.188 --> 59:01.929
They've interviewed
a number of candidates

59:02.103 --> 59:04.149
for the coaching position
at the high school.

59:04.323 --> 59:07.239
That's great. The team has
a lot of potential.

59:07.413 --> 59:10.634
-You know, honey,
it's not too late to--
-Mom!

59:10.808 --> 59:14.376
I told you, I'm not looking
for anything permanent.

59:14.551 --> 59:18.032
I know, I just wanna make sure
you've thought it through.

59:18.206 --> 59:21.079
For better or worse,
you do tend to lead
with your emotions.

59:21.253 --> 59:25.126
Hey... if you can't trust
your heart, what can you trust?

59:25.300 --> 59:27.651
Wow, that is deep.

59:27.825 --> 59:30.828
Someone really smart
must have taught that to you.

59:31.002 --> 59:32.699
-Thank you for the coffee.
-[chuckles]

59:32.873 --> 59:34.005
-And the muffin!
-Yes.

59:34.179 --> 59:36.224
-I love you!
-I love you, too!

59:36.398 --> 59:38.575
[door opens, shuts]

59:43.754 --> 59:45.103
What's in the bag?

59:45.277 --> 59:48.062
The old flyers. At least
I got what I could.

59:48.236 --> 59:49.803
Great. Just toss them.

59:49.977 --> 59:51.675
Or better yet, recycle them.

59:51.849 --> 59:54.155
Don't worry,
I'll put 'em to good use.

59:59.726 --> 01:00:01.249
Hey, darlin'.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:02.250
What's all this?

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:04.339
You're cooking?

01:00:04.513 --> 01:00:07.604
Oh, I thought I would whip up
some of your mom's gumbo.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:10.737
A little fuel for you
to get through final show prep.

01:00:10.911 --> 01:00:13.522
Oh, smells good.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.612
Wait...

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.788
where's Mom's recipe book?

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:20.834
OK, now, I might not be
the best cook in the world,

01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:24.882
but if there's one dish
I know how to make by heart,
it's this gumbo.

01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:27.058
Oh, really?

01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.800
The holidays were hectic,
raising you kids and...

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:34.587
Your mother and I did not
get a lot of quality time
at Christmas.

01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:38.199
So, I always made it a point
to sit in here
in the kitchen with her

01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:40.593
while she made her gumbo.

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:44.902
We'd have a glass of wine,
and we would talk about...
everything.

01:00:47.078 --> 01:00:50.168
What was Mom like
when you first met her?

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:53.388
Well, you know your mom.
Staggeringly beautiful...

01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:56.217
annoyingly confident...

01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:58.002
You're a lot like her,
you know.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:05.966
I know this whole Mary thing
kind of took you by surprise.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:09.013
But I don't want you
to think for a second

01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:11.972
that I don't miss your mom
every single day.

01:01:17.064 --> 01:01:18.718
It's important to me
that you're OK with this.

01:01:21.373 --> 01:01:22.591
I know.

01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:27.031
So...

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:29.207
-Are you gonna let me
try that gumbo?
-Oh!

01:01:30.904 --> 01:01:31.775
There we go.

01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:36.693
-OK, it's hot but...
-That's good.

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:40.697
-It's perfect.
-Awesome!

01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:49.880
[Jen]  I can't believe
the show is tomorrow.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:53.405
I know,
it's been a whirlwind.

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.755
Aww, you mentioned us all
in the special thanks.

01:01:55.929 --> 01:02:00.760
Honestly, I could have
never pulled this off
without you guys.

01:02:00.934 --> 01:02:04.111
Has it been weird at all...
spending so much time
with Nick?

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:06.374
Actually, he's been great.

01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:09.682
I mean, especially
with the kids.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.945
You two seemed pretty cozy
last night...

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:13.686
-We fell asleep.
-On each other!

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.210
-By accident!
-I'm just saying there was some

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:18.952
-minor cuddling happening.
-There was no cuddling.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.041
How do you know?
You were asleep.

01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:23.217
It's OK if you like him.

01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:26.220
Maybe you were put back
into each other's lives
for a reason.

01:02:26.394 --> 01:02:30.921
No. He can't wait
to get back to his old life.

01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:34.446
If you tell him how you feel,
maybe he'll want to stay.

01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:45.326
[Nick] All right.
Only a couple left.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.764
-You got that last
one there, Will?
-Yes, sir, I do.

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:51.028
Very nicely done, boys.

01:02:51.202 --> 01:02:53.900
I bet that shoulder injury
gets you out of
a lot of things.

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:55.728
[chuckles]

01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:56.903
Can't deny that.

01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:59.688
What I can do...

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.386
is crack a couple of beers.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.563
I'll take mine to go. Gotta
get back to those animals.

01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:07.131
You boys have fun.
Will, appreciate you, bud.

01:03:07.305 --> 01:03:08.697
Randy, thank you.

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.574
So...

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.056
High school Nick
and Hometown Nick

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:20.797
seem like
two different Nicks.

01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:24.801
Yup.

01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:29.196
You know, it is my job to be
the protective older brother.

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.720
It's a job I take
very seriously.

01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:33.940
I get it.

01:03:34.114 --> 01:03:36.595
And I've had a long time
to think about how stupid
I was back then.

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:41.382
Yep,
you were pretty stupid.

01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:45.125
Just make sure this time...
you realize what you've got...

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:46.823
before you let it go again.

01:03:50.522 --> 01:03:52.176
OK.

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.265
Let's get these back
to the women in charge.

01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:56.267
-Yeah, let's do that.
-[bottles clink]

01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.623
-[Noelle]  That goes
right in there.
-[Jen] Perfect.

01:04:04.797 --> 01:04:07.408
So, Nick, were you in
the nativity as a kid?

01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:10.281
Yeah, it was kind of
a rite of passage around here.

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:13.023
Yeah, Nick always wanted to be
one of the three wise men.

01:04:13.197 --> 01:04:16.200
Then there was that one year,
he took matters
into his own hands.

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.158
-What did you do?
-I stole the frankincense.

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:21.422
And as memorable as it was,
I'm really hoping

01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:23.903
that the kids all stick to
their assigned parts this year.

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:26.775
-Hey, you guys
have plans tonight?
-Why?

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.821
My friends and I are doing
a little night fishing,

01:04:28.995 --> 01:04:30.388
at the pond behind
Evan Taylor's house.

01:04:30.562 --> 01:04:31.432
It's nothing fancy,

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:33.304
but should be a good time.

01:04:33.478 --> 01:04:34.348
Would love to have you all.

01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:35.610
You guys still do that?

01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:37.308
Yeah, it's tradition.

01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:39.049
What they do is they take
Christmas lights

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:40.267
and wrap
around the fishing pole.

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.443
I'm pretty sure
it scares the fish away.

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:44.184
But it looks festive.

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:46.012
Well, I've never
been night fishing.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.145
[Nick]
All the more reason to come.

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:50.147
You guys should totally go.
I've got a lot of work
to finish up--

01:04:50.321 --> 01:04:51.888
She'll be there.

01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:54.760
No, I've got a lot--

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:58.329
Uh...

01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.592
I guess I could take a break.

01:05:00.766 --> 01:05:05.597
Great.
Well, it starts around eight,
but you guys can come whenever.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:06.511
I'm gonna grab
some more bulbs.

01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:09.427
[Will] Yeah.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:12.082
I think the words you're
searching for are "thank you."

01:05:12.256 --> 01:05:14.911
[scoffs] You're the worst!

01:05:16.521 --> 01:05:18.262
Thank you.

It means a lot to me
that you came.

01:05:44.157 --> 01:05:46.855
Of course.
I wanted to come.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.858
-After all, it's tradition.
-That's right.

01:05:55.255 --> 01:05:58.084
Hey,
you wanna go take a walk?

01:05:58.258 --> 01:05:59.085
Sure.

01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:07.093
So, are you missing Chicago?

01:06:07.267 --> 01:06:08.965
A little.

01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:11.402
But it's always been a dream
of mine to work with my dad.

01:06:13.273 --> 01:06:15.449
Any tough goodbyes?

01:06:15.623 --> 01:06:18.235
What... you mean,
like a boyfriend?

01:06:19.453 --> 01:06:22.065
Ehm... no.

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:26.417
I had a semi-serious
relationship when I first
started my residency but...

01:06:26.591 --> 01:06:29.333
it didn't work out.
Too many long hours.

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:32.684
Yeah, I had a few of those
"didn't work outs."

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:35.078
-Not fun.
-No.

01:06:35.252 --> 01:06:36.905
I never really knew
if girls liked me

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.213
or if they just liked the idea
of dating a baseball player.

01:06:40.387 --> 01:06:42.346
I dated a baseball player once.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.564
Oh, yeah? What was he like?

01:06:43.738 --> 01:06:45.088
Wait, let me guess.

01:06:45.262 --> 01:06:48.178
He was handsome
and charming and...

01:06:48.352 --> 01:06:52.356
a little selfish,
a touch full of himself.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:56.229
-A lot full of himself?
-Oh... so you've met him?

01:06:56.403 --> 01:06:58.405
Yeah,
I think I knew the guy.

01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:00.929
Haven't seen him around
in a really long time.

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:05.151
The truth is, Noelle...

01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:07.719
I didn't deserve you.

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:09.895
I was so focused
on my dream that

01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:12.376
I didn't make
you feel important.

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:17.337
And I pushed you away.
I'm sorry.

01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:20.949
I never wanted you
to give up on your dream, Nick.

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:24.605
I just didn't know
why I couldn't be part of it.

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:26.738
My biggest regret was that...

01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:30.481
I didn't just
lose a girlfriend.
I lost a friend.

01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:32.700
And I needed that
more than you know.

01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:36.052
I missed you, too.

01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:44.886
[Jen] Noelle?

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.368
Oh, sorry. We lost
track of you and...

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:51.937
No, it's OK. We were...
just about to head back.

01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:55.245
We were gonna see
if you wanted to head out,
but if you wanna stay...

01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:58.422
No, no, uh, you're right.
Tomorrow is a big day.

01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:01.251
Um.
I'll meet you by the car?

01:08:01.425 --> 01:08:04.036
Yeah, K. Night, Nick.

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.559
Good night!

01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:12.088
Don't stay up too late.
I need you there with me
tomorrow.

01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:13.611
I'll be there.

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:17.223
Good night, Nick.

01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:18.180
Good night, Noelle.

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.808
-[Will]
Good morning, Sissy.
-[laughs]

01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:39.376
-Happy show day.
-Merry Christmas Eve.

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:42.683
-What did you get me
for Christmas?
-Oh, no! You know the rules.

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:44.598
No touching, shaking,
or holding Christmas presents

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:46.209
until Christmas Day.

01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:49.341
[Jen laughs]
Good luck with that.

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:50.822
So, you're ready
for the show tonight?

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:53.477
Yeah, I think I am.

01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:55.740
Speaking of which.
I better get going.

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:57.828
I've gotta meet Nick
at the barn.

01:08:58.002 --> 01:09:00.484
[in lowered voice]
Hey, um, about last night...

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:04.662
-I'm sorry if I interrupted,
or I've--
-No!

01:09:04.836 --> 01:09:09.796
-You didn't interrupt anything.
-But I hear she interrupted
an almost something.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.886
What? Of course she told me.
We're engaged.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.149
-We tell each other everything.
-Sorry.

01:09:14.323 --> 01:09:17.979
You know, Nick and I just...
got caught up in the moment.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.069
-I-it just happened.
-Almost kisses don't
just happen, Sis.

01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:22.810
[Jen] Did you tell him
how you feel?

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:25.639
OK, so, how about we just
don't talk about the kiss,

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:29.600
or almost kiss, or whatever
you think it was,
which it wasn't.

01:09:29.774 --> 01:09:33.125
I, heh, I will...
I gotta go. Um...

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:34.692
I'll see you at the show.

01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:35.910
See you at the show.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.957
-Let me know if she comes back.
-Why?

01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:41.176
No!

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:52.188
Let there be light.

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:00.631
[Will] Hey.

01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:03.503
-Hey.
-Do you have a second?

01:10:03.677 --> 01:10:05.940
Sure. I'm just going over
the checklist for tonight.

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:08.029
Noelle asked me
to help out backstage.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.207
-So, what's up?
-There's something
I want to show you.

01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:15.646
-[Will] We're almost there.
-[Jen] Oh...

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.518
-[Will] A few more steps.
-[chuckles] OK.

01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:20.433
Stop right... there.

01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:22.305
-Keep your eyes closed.
-OK.

01:10:26.657 --> 01:10:28.833
I was saving this
for tomorrow but...

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:31.792
you know how great I am
at keeping secrets...

01:10:31.966 --> 01:10:33.229
and I just couldn't wait.

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:37.537
Open your eyes.

01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:49.984
Oh...

01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:54.685
[Jen] It's snow.

01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:58.689
Well, technically it's
old tax papers and...

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:01.866
receipts,
the old show flyers and...

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.521
some papers I shouldn't have
shredded but...

01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:06.958
yeah, it's snow.

01:11:13.225 --> 01:11:15.662
I can't believe
you did all this.

01:11:15.836 --> 01:11:17.925
I saw how much you were
missing our family
the other day

01:11:18.099 --> 01:11:19.927
when they were
playing in the snow.

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:22.669
And you have been
such a trooper this week.

01:11:22.843 --> 01:11:27.718
I have loved every second
I've spent with my new family.

01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:29.937
I can't wait to start
our lives together.

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:39.295
So... you and your dad
are snowball champions, huh?

01:11:40.165 --> 01:11:41.253
Uh-huh.

01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:44.735
Oh...

01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:47.346
Oh, I see how it's gonna be.
Did you see how I caught that?

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.826
Let's see what you got.

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:52.264
[gasps]

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:55.311
[laughing]

01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:57.356
[sighs]

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:05.712
[Peter] When you didn't
answer your phone
I thought you might be here.

01:12:05.886 --> 01:12:08.802
I am going to bake
an apple pie

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:12.110
with a rosemary
buttermilk crust.

01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:14.547
It will be my contribution
to the refreshment table.

01:12:14.721 --> 01:12:17.071
That sounds incredible.

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:19.857
I know Noelle
has really appreciated

01:12:20.031 --> 01:12:22.294
everything you and Nick
have done to help.

01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:24.383
And... I do, too.

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:27.734
-Nick and Noelle
are quite the pair.
-Yes, they are.

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:29.867
We raised some
pretty terrific kids.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:33.305
-Oh, they take after
their parents.
-Hm.

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:35.612
So, what are you doing
before the show?

01:12:35.786 --> 01:12:37.657
[sighs]
It is the weirdest thing.

01:12:37.831 --> 01:12:41.139
I've had this hankering
for an apple pie

01:12:41.313 --> 01:12:43.576
with a buttermilk
rosemary crust...

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.449
-[Mary laughing]
I believe I can help.
-[Peter laughs]

01:12:49.234 --> 01:12:52.106
[Noelle] Wow, it looks
just like I remember it.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.281
[Nick] Ah, I don't know...

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:56.720
I think it looks
a touch better.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:59.897
Let's go to Legends
and grab something to eat

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:01.159
-before we have
to be back in a few hours
-OK.

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.727
[Randy] Uh, hey...
Nick, Noelle...

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.120
Uh... there's a bit
of a situation.

01:13:06.294 --> 01:13:09.123
-What kind of situation?
-It's the animals.
They're gone.

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.212
-What?
-All of them?

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.085
Uh, yeah. I mean,
except for the pig.

01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:16.783
-Wh-what happened?
-We gave them a bath
for the show tonight,

01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.916
you know, and I guess...
the pen got left unlocked.

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.918
Look, I got a guy out
looking for them, right now.

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:23.877
Noelle, I am really, really
sorry, but I promise you

01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:28.055
I will do my best to find them
before the show tonight.

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:30.667
[Noelle]
What are we gonna do?
I mean,

01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:33.800
it's a live nativity.
If we don't have animals,
then what do we call it?

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:37.108
The town doesn't come out
to see a show because of
a few farm animals.

01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:39.806
They come out to see the kids
and the story of Christmas.

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.852
-I know what to do.
-You do?

01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:44.202
If I'm not back before
the doors open, just stall.

01:13:44.376 --> 01:13:46.422
-W-wait...
-Just stall.

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:56.432
Oh, Mary, Peter.

01:13:56.606 --> 01:13:58.303
-Hi.
-Pastor, how are you?

01:13:58.477 --> 01:14:00.436
I'm good. You two
must be very proud.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:02.089
-Oh, yeah.
-We are.

01:14:02.263 --> 01:14:04.788
It's amazing how everything
just fell into place

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:07.051
like it was supposed to.

01:14:07.225 --> 01:14:10.097
-Look at that. I guess
we'd better find a seat.
-Enjoy the show.

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:15.102
[whispering]
So, are we a "thing" now?

01:14:15.276 --> 01:14:17.670
Oh, yeah, we are a thing.

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:28.594
Hey.
Have you seen Noelle, yet?

01:14:28.768 --> 01:14:30.248
No, I haven't. You need
to get backstage now,

01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:32.772
-Jen's waiting on you.
-OK.

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.687
OK, my shepherds.

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:37.603
Go to the back, get your
head dresses and your staff.

01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:40.258
[Jen] My angels, come over here
and get your halos and wings.

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:43.348
-Hey.
-Where have you been?
I've been kind of freaking out.

01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:44.784
The doors are open,
but I don't know

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:46.917
how much longer we can wait.
What can I do?

01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:49.702
Oh, the kids are already
almost in costume...

01:14:49.876 --> 01:14:52.226
Do you have Noelle's narration,
in case she doesn't show up?

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.967
No, it's in her binder.

01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:57.014
OK. Well, the show
is about to begin, so...

01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:59.930
-I suggest you start
making something up.
-Me?

01:15:00.104 --> 01:15:03.281
-We have animals!
-Oh, Noelle, thank goodness.

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:05.631
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

01:15:05.805 --> 01:15:09.461
Jen, you find our smallest
shepherds and angels
and change them into that.

01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:10.984
My little angels! Come with me!

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:14.510
-Where did you--
-Kids in costumes.

01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:16.773
I remembered that they were
putting on the barnyard play

01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:18.557
at the theater,
and I just took a chance,

01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.212
and luckily they are not
performing over the holidays.

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:23.127
That's amazing.
And hilarious.

01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:25.521
Hey, when there was no room
at the inn for Joseph and Mary,

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:26.783
they had to improvise,
too, right?

01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:28.828
[Jen] One minute
to curtain, everyone!

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:34.617
You ready?

01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:36.967
Yeah.

01:15:37.141 --> 01:15:38.664
I think so.

01:15:38.838 --> 01:15:40.927
[Jen] Places, everybody.

01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:43.234
-Mary, Gabriel, you're on deck.
-Joseph, you're with me.

01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:44.583
Great.

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:46.019
-[Nick] Go get 'em!
-Oh!

01:15:48.195 --> 01:15:50.328
OK, Will, dim the lights.

01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:55.028
Oh.

01:15:57.204 --> 01:16:00.686
[clapping]

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:10.783
Good evening, everyone.

01:16:10.957 --> 01:16:14.004
Welcome to tonight's telling
of the Christmas Story,

01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:18.835
where we get to share
with all of you
the true meaning of this day.

01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:21.533
"A long time ago
in the town of Nazareth,

01:16:21.707 --> 01:16:23.491
lived a young woman named Mary.

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:26.059
One day, while Mary
was at home,

01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:28.235
the angel Gabriel
suddenly appeared.

01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:31.325
The angel said,
'Do not be afraid.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:36.504
You will have a baby boy,
and you will name him Jesus''

01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:38.028
Mary and Joseph were married

01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:39.899
and then traveled
from Nazareth to Bethlehem

01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:41.814
for the census.

01:16:41.988 --> 01:16:44.034
When they
finally reached Bethlehem,

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:45.601
the only place
that they could find

01:16:45.775 --> 01:16:47.298
was a stable
amongst the animals.

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:51.041
That night, an exciting
and wonderful thing happened.

01:16:51.215 --> 01:16:53.609
Mary and Joseph had a baby,

01:16:55.175 --> 01:16:57.830
Jesus, the son of God.

01:16:58.004 --> 01:17:02.052
She wrapped him
in swaddling clothes
and laid him in a manger.

01:17:02.226 --> 01:17:04.054
In the fields
outside of Bethlehem

01:17:04.228 --> 01:17:05.925
there were shepherds
keeping watch..."

01:17:06.099 --> 01:17:08.362
[whispering]
Go, go! Go on.

01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:11.148
[crowd laughs]

01:17:15.108 --> 01:17:17.545
"An angel said,
'Do not be afraid.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.201
for there is born to you
this day, in the city of David,

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.116
a savior.'

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:25.292
So the shepherds
and their sheep...

01:17:25.466 --> 01:17:29.383
cow, camel, and donkey...
hurried to Bethlehem

01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:32.952
and found the baby, just as
the angel has told them..."

01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:35.389
[Randy whispering]
Jen, look what I found.

01:17:35.563 --> 01:17:38.088
[whispering]
Oh, my goodness.

01:17:38.262 --> 01:17:42.135
-Am I too late?
-I just sent them.

01:17:42.309 --> 01:17:45.443
They look so cute
in their animal costumes.

01:17:45.617 --> 01:17:47.097
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:48.925
You're still a star
to me, baby.

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:50.622
[Noelle]
"When Jesus was born,

01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:53.320
a brand new bright star
appeared in the sky.

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:56.106
Some Wise Men
in faraway countries,

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.805
who studied the stars, had read
that a new star would appear

01:17:59.979 --> 01:18:02.155
when a great king was born.

01:18:03.809 --> 01:18:05.376
So when they saw the star,

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:08.858
they set out to find the
new king and bring him gifts.

01:18:09.032 --> 01:18:10.816
When they found the baby,

01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:13.427
they spread the gifts
they had brought before him,

01:18:13.601 --> 01:18:16.604
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

01:18:16.779 --> 01:18:19.912
Everyone's hearts
were full that night.

01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:22.785
For unto us a child is born.

01:18:25.222 --> 01:18:27.137
Now every year on Christmas Day
we come together

01:18:27.311 --> 01:18:30.009
to celebrate
what happened that night.

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:33.883
And remember,
if you see a star in the sky,

01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:37.277
it could be a sign
that a miracle is on its way."

01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:38.714
[applause]

01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:48.985
[applause continues]

01:18:56.296 --> 01:18:59.082
-Whoo! You were
great out there.
-Thanks.

01:18:59.256 --> 01:19:00.997
You're ready
to bring it all home?

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:03.956
I don't think I can do this.

01:19:05.088 --> 01:19:06.742
Yes, you can.

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:08.265
I'll be right there with you.

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:11.529
[exhales]

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.885
-Let's give the kids
another round of applause, huh?
-[applause]

01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:22.670
Aren't they adorable?

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:26.544
Now, traditionally,
the show ends...

01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:29.416
with a song
by the beloved Carol Collins.

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:31.723
We all remember that voice.

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:35.074
Well, her daughter
Noelle didn't want
the tradition to end.

01:19:35.248 --> 01:19:37.685
So we'd like to perform it
for you tonight.

01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:51.134
[whispering]

Thank you.

01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:26.637
She was really pretty.
Yeah, I was really impressed--

01:22:26.811 --> 01:22:28.944
Ah, there's my girl.

01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:32.599
-Sweetheart,
the show was fantastic.
-Aww, thanks, Daddy.

01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:36.212
-You were great.
-Wow, who knew you could
sing like that?

01:22:36.386 --> 01:22:38.518
Your mother
would have been so proud.

01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:41.434
Aww.
Where's Nick?

01:22:41.608 --> 01:22:44.481
-We thought he was
backstage with you.
-I'm gonna go find him.

01:22:44.655 --> 01:22:47.179
-I will meet you guys
out by the tree.
-OK.

01:22:47.353 --> 01:22:48.441
-Great job.
-Thank you.

01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:49.921
Congrats!

01:23:00.497 --> 01:23:01.846
[Noelle] Hey.

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.152
I thought I lost you.

01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:05.023
[sighs]

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:06.764
What are you doing out here?

01:23:06.938 --> 01:23:08.331
Just thinking.

01:23:08.505 --> 01:23:10.072
About?

01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:12.900
This week. How crazy
it's all been.

01:23:13.075 --> 01:23:14.467
Tell me about it.

01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:16.469
It's actually the first time
since being back

01:23:16.643 --> 01:23:19.733
that I haven't wanted
to be somewhere else.

01:23:19.907 --> 01:23:22.649
-It's mostly because of you.
-Well, I had fun
this week, too.

01:23:22.823 --> 01:23:25.609
Everyone loved your song.

01:23:25.783 --> 01:23:27.872
Uh, well,
I blame that on you.

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:30.918
Maybe nest year
we do a duet, hmm?

01:23:31.093 --> 01:23:34.226
Legends has open mic night
every Thursday.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.706
Plenty of time to practice.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.448
Well, you know, you have to
physically be here

01:23:38.622 --> 01:23:41.233
in order for
that to happen, right?

01:23:41.407 --> 01:23:44.367
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.

01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:46.499
-What about your baseball--
-I seem to remember

01:23:46.673 --> 01:23:49.024
someone saying I'd make
a pretty great coach.

01:23:50.112 --> 01:23:51.026
Wait...

01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:54.812
You took the job?

01:23:54.986 --> 01:23:57.989
I... I don't understand.
What changed?

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.079
I was chasing the wrong dream.

01:24:02.863 --> 01:24:04.691
I know what I want, now.

01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:09.435
To be near my family,
to make a difference
in the place I grew up.

01:24:09.609 --> 01:24:10.958
And to do all of that...

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:15.050
with someone I love
by my side.

01:24:16.747 --> 01:24:18.053
I want that, too.

01:24:30.326 --> 01:24:32.023
So, does this mean
you'll come to my games?

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:33.677
Of course.

01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:35.853
I went to all your games.

01:24:36.027 --> 01:24:38.029
-Did you?
-I did.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:42.381
Does this mean I get a jersey?

01:24:42.555 --> 01:24:44.470
I might be able to have
the hookup for that.

01:24:44.644 --> 01:24:46.168
-[laughs] Do you know someone?
-Maybe.

01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:54.654
[chatter]

01:24:57.701 --> 01:24:59.398
-Ah, there it is.
-The tree!

01:25:04.055 --> 01:25:05.100
They're they are.

01:25:08.190 --> 01:25:09.191
Looks like you found him.

01:25:09.365 --> 01:25:12.150
Hey, babe.

01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:15.240
-You were so good up there.
-[Pastor Lewis] Hey, everybody!

01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:18.025
Everybody! Hey, well...

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.203
Well, we certainly have been
blessed so far, haven't we?

01:25:21.377 --> 01:25:23.379
But this evening
would not be complete

01:25:23.553 --> 01:25:26.295
without the lighting
of the tree.

01:25:26.469 --> 01:25:29.211
Noelle, you wanna come
help me do the honors?

01:25:29.385 --> 01:25:33.084
[Noelle]
Thank you, Pastor Lewis.
This is so exciting.

01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:35.173
OK, everybody, count with me.

01:25:35.347 --> 01:25:37.958
[all together]
Three! Two! One!

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:42.049
[cheering]

01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:44.008
Oh, it's a beautiful tree.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.148
So, you got any plans
for New Years?

01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:55.628
Hmm...

01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:58.501
what exactly
did you have in mind?

01:25:58.675 --> 01:26:01.895
Well, I'm up for anything.
As long as it's with you.

01:26:05.812 --> 01:26:07.640
[Will] How was your
first southern Christmas?

01:26:07.814 --> 01:26:10.643
-It was absolutely perfect.
-Yeah?

01:26:10.817 --> 01:26:12.732
Even without the snow?

01:26:12.906 --> 01:26:14.256
Snow is overrated.

01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:15.822
[chuckles]

01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:20.914
You pulled it off.

01:26:21.088 --> 01:26:23.613
We pulled it off.

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:27.138
-Same time next year?
-It's a date.

01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:29.009
Merry Christmas, Noelle.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.620
