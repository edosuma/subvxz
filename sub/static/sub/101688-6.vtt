00:15.020 --> 00:19.300
The skies in this world
are just as beautiful as ours.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.100
It gives me some hope.

00:23.660 --> 00:24.900
Lyra must be close.

00:33.940 --> 00:36.060
Angels.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.660
It can't be.

00:37.660 --> 00:40.580
They haven't made themselves visible
for thousands of years.

00:40.580 --> 00:44.860
And the last time they were seen,
it was to make war.

00:44.860 --> 00:49.740
Now that Asriel has thrown the
worlds apart, they are going to him.

00:49.740 --> 00:52.420
If Asriel has angels on his side,
he can do anything.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.460
This is the sign I needed.

00:58.620 --> 01:02.340
You want to follow?
I will bring Asriel back,

01:02.340 --> 01:04.380
and we will return to our world

01:04.380 --> 01:07.140
and destroy the Magisterium
together.

01:13.220 --> 01:14.860
We must find Lyra.

01:27.260 --> 01:31.540
The fate of many worlds
may rest on you.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.980
- You have a task ahead of you.
- Will?

01:38.260 --> 01:39.300
Will?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.180
His hand is worse.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.860
I'm not sure we can help him, Lyra.

02:13.940 --> 02:15.100
This way.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.020
Lyra.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.180
Lyra!

02:50.220 --> 02:51.620
I see you.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.260
Will, wake up!
Will, we need to get out of here!

02:58.260 --> 03:00.140
Angelica's downstairs
and she's going to kill us.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.340
Will, hurry up!

03:15.100 --> 03:16.340
Come on, this way.

03:23.180 --> 03:24.460
Will, help me!

03:46.620 --> 03:48.180
Can you get us out of here?

03:48.180 --> 03:50.460
Hurry!

03:52.420 --> 03:55.580
He has the knife!
Look, we don't want to hurt you.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.500
We want to hurt you.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.460
You killed our brother
and you stole the knife.

04:02.460 --> 04:05.580
It would have protected us
and our adults in the hills.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.460
I am so sorry about your brother.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.540
Leave. Now.

06:11.820 --> 06:14.060
Let me see the wound.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.740
Was it your knife that made that?

06:28.180 --> 06:30.020
Show them, Will.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.860
If you trust me, you trust her.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.580
You never met her.

06:41.580 --> 06:45.180
And if you think you can keep
anything from her, you can't.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.340
They're here to help us.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.980
You ever seen such a blade before?

06:55.980 --> 06:57.020
No.

06:59.140 --> 07:00.460
This edge.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.060
What does this edge cut?

07:02.060 --> 07:03.380
Everything.
Nothing.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.420
Well, you're not poisoned.

07:19.660 --> 07:21.340
But this isn't a normal wound.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.140
It's going to take more than plants
to heal it.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.060
It needs a spell.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.540
We need to gather lichens.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.700
Well, if that isn't
the craziest thing.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.620
Do you think
you can fly through it?

08:01.620 --> 08:03.820
Just make yourself comfortable,
Mr Jopari.

08:03.820 --> 08:05.220
We're going in.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.780
Woohoo!

08:44.700 --> 08:47.620
OK, so, not quite
the Cave and a keyboard,

08:47.620 --> 08:50.100
but let's see if you work as well.

09:13.540 --> 09:18.940
"Turning to the summit for provision
of nourishment brings good fortune.

09:18.940 --> 09:23.220
"Spying about with sharp eyes like a
tiger with insatiable craving.

09:27.420 --> 09:30.900
"Keeping still as the mountain,
it is a bypath.

09:30.900 --> 09:34.580
"It means little stones,
doors and openings.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.700
"Signs are coming that will
steel you on your path."

09:39.700 --> 09:42.500
Good. Something
I can understand for a change.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.340
You know, you keep staring at me.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.820
I've always wanted to meet a witch.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.780
My father gave me a book
about witches.

09:57.780 --> 09:59.380
It had pictures in it.

10:00.540 --> 10:01.900
They all had raven hair.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.220
I find those books irritating.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.740
Asriel knows what
a witch looks like.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.060
Don't touch that flower.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.380
I want to know everything.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.980
What can you do?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.500
What can I do?

10:15.500 --> 10:17.660
I know you can fly, obviously.

10:17.660 --> 10:21.180
And you can kill, pretty easily.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.460
And the cold doesn't affect you.

10:23.460 --> 10:25.420
And you can hear
whispers on the wind.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.900
Are we safe?

10:30.740 --> 10:31.860
Is Will safe?

10:35.380 --> 10:37.340
His wound is deep.
But he'll get better.

10:37.340 --> 10:39.540
Right? Now that we're with you,
he'll be better?

10:39.540 --> 10:42.100
We will do what we can here.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.980
But then we must travel
to our lands.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.380
Our lands?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.740
The flora is more
powerful in our world.

10:49.740 --> 10:51.620
Taking us home?

10:51.620 --> 10:53.540
I pledged to keep you safe, Lyra.

10:54.580 --> 10:56.660
We'll do so at home.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.020
A place I know.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.500
A place I can hide you.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.740
Why isn't she frightened?

11:23.980 --> 11:25.620
She's not from here, is she?

11:51.020 --> 11:54.580
Maybe they're right.
Maybe we should go to my world.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.100
Why did you leave, Lyra?

11:57.620 --> 11:58.780
To investigate Dust.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.460
To try to do my best by Roger.

12:05.860 --> 12:07.660
The thing is, these witches...

12:08.940 --> 12:11.980
..they're connected to the Earth,
they can find answer after answer.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.300
And my father?

12:15.700 --> 12:17.580
What does the
alethiometer say to do?

12:18.700 --> 12:20.700
Will, I can see the way you're
hiding your hand,

12:20.700 --> 12:22.420
I know it's bleeding.

12:22.420 --> 12:23.620
Only a little.

12:23.620 --> 12:25.780
There are more powerful
plants in my world.

12:25.780 --> 12:28.100
They say that, and I think
that, too. Look, I get it.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.420
You're scared cos
you think I can't go on.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.260
I can do this.

12:34.260 --> 12:35.420
We can do this.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.700
Ask the alethiometer
where my father is,

12:38.700 --> 12:41.100
what world he's in,
where we might find him.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.980
He's close.

13:23.460 --> 13:24.700
What?!

13:26.580 --> 13:27.820
He's in this world.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.940
So this is a new world?

13:41.180 --> 13:45.820
New to those not born in it -
as old as yours or mine otherwise.

13:45.820 --> 13:49.380
What Asriel has done has shaken
everything up, Mr Scoresby.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.820
Looks empty.

13:50.820 --> 13:55.900
Not so. Beyond that headland
is a city once powerful and wealthy.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.540
That's where we're headed to.

13:57.540 --> 13:58.980
The knife bearer may be there.

14:00.020 --> 14:03.140
Once great, the city
has fallen on hard times.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.260
In another life, I'd be looking for
what I could scavenge.

14:06.260 --> 14:09.540
In another life, neither
of us would be here at all.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.300
You have a strange way about you,
Mr Jopari.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.340
They say things about shamans.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.860
Oh, yeah, what do they say?
That they have powers.

14:16.860 --> 14:18.140
That they can fly.

14:19.140 --> 14:21.780
Yet you cannot.

14:21.780 --> 14:23.020
Oh, but I can.

14:23.020 --> 14:25.380
How do you figure? I needed to fly.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.420
I summoned you.

14:27.420 --> 14:30.780
Here I am - flying.

14:30.780 --> 14:34.540
I'm human, but I've learnt
a few things along the way.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.940
I've spent time with witches,
academicians, spirits.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.780
I've found folly everywhere.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.180
And this journey,
is it folly or wisdom?

14:45.180 --> 14:46.420
This journey?

14:51.260 --> 14:52.740
I don't know.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.540
So we find the bearer of
the Subtle Knife, and what then?

14:55.540 --> 14:57.540
We tell him what his task is.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.700
And that task includes
protecting Lyra?

15:01.740 --> 15:03.140
It will protect us all.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.060
That's it, we're stopping.
No, ask the alethiometer.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.300
Ask how close my father is.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.220
There's no point getting you
to your father if,

15:14.220 --> 15:15.940
when we get you there,
you're half-dead.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.940
No, you're using me
as an excuse to stop.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.380
I'm sorry.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.220
I know you wouldn't use me
as an excuse to stop.

15:31.660 --> 15:32.900
Apology accepted.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.180
You should rest, too.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.940
Are you sure about this?

16:00.940 --> 16:02.580
I have never been more sure.

16:03.860 --> 16:05.300
You want the knife, don't you?

16:46.140 --> 16:47.660
She's there.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.460
It's all right, you know?

16:49.460 --> 16:51.060
You can come out.

16:54.940 --> 16:57.020
Hello. I'm Mary.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.660
Do you want something to eat?

17:05.100 --> 17:07.580
It's no good for you at all.
It's full of sugar.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.020
I won't tell your parents.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.020
Haven't got parents.

17:16.020 --> 17:18.060
The Spectres got 'em.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.420
The Spectres?

17:20.420 --> 17:22.660
How come they're not
getting you, miss?

17:22.660 --> 17:23.980
Can you not even see them?

17:25.380 --> 17:27.140
Oh, we can't see them either, but...

17:29.380 --> 17:31.340
Paola.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.700
Hi.

17:32.700 --> 17:36.220
So, you're alone, then?

17:36.220 --> 17:38.020
The other adults
used to look after us,

17:38.020 --> 17:39.860
but then they got scared,
ran up to the hills.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.460
To the mountain.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.940
Now the other kids have gone, too.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.860
You're not from this world, are you?

17:48.420 --> 17:50.020
Like that Lyra girl.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.820
Lyra? You've seen Lyra?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.220
I don't like her.

17:54.220 --> 17:57.540
She did something bad to Tullio.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.780
We were trying to kill her,
but she escaped.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.940
Was that wrong?

18:03.940 --> 18:05.540
Yes.

18:05.540 --> 18:09.460
Everything's wrong here, miss,
you'll learn that soon enough.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.980
Where has Lyra gone?

18:10.980 --> 18:12.420
She's with the witch.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.500
Miss, can I have a hug?

18:21.540 --> 18:22.820
Yeah.

18:30.700 --> 18:31.980
Can you stay for a bit?

18:32.980 --> 18:35.060
Look after us?

18:35.060 --> 18:36.660
The Spectres aren't getting you -

18:36.660 --> 18:38.380
you don't have to go
like the others.

18:38.380 --> 18:42.460
You can make us have baths and tell
us what to do and all that.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.500
I've been sent here
to do something important.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.940
We'll be fine.

18:51.940 --> 18:53.500
We've got each other.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.780
Go on, Paola.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.820
Wait.

19:01.820 --> 19:04.100
You shouldn't be here alone.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.140
Come with me.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.020
I'll bring you to your adults.

19:10.780 --> 19:13.020
I'm thinking
about my wife and my son.

19:14.660 --> 19:17.100
I feel closer to him here.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.940
I haven't been back to this world
since I left my own.

19:21.980 --> 19:23.660
I hadn't even met Sayan Kotor.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.980
You don't see your
daemon in my world.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.300
I'd given up hope of finding a
window and getting back to them.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.300
Anyway, you were right.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.540
I should sleep.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.060
If only I could.

19:42.060 --> 19:44.980
I tell you what - why don't we
make some coffee instead?

19:44.980 --> 19:46.260
Thank you.

19:52.780 --> 19:54.260
Let me help.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.020
Yeah, can you magic us up some fire?

19:58.660 --> 20:00.060
One moment.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.460
Right.

20:18.820 --> 20:22.100
The knife that Will carries,
the way it's cut him -

20:22.100 --> 20:24.180
it's no ordinary cut.

20:24.180 --> 20:27.580
It scares me, how he got
a weapon this powerful.

20:27.580 --> 20:30.220
You think you need
to protect me from Will?

20:30.220 --> 20:32.220
Will's knife is amazing.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.660
It can be very dangerous if it's
in the wrong hands, but...

20:36.100 --> 20:38.780
..Will's the bearer,
he wouldn't do anything to me.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.700
Serafina Pekkala, my job is
to help Will find his father.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.020
Will's father?

20:48.420 --> 20:50.180
The alethiometer said so.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.220
I stopped trusting it
after Roger died.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.340
But I lost it.

20:57.860 --> 20:59.620
And I found out how important it is.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.820
How it's a part of me.

21:05.180 --> 21:08.780
So if it says I need to help Will,
then that's what I've got to do.

21:13.420 --> 21:15.820
People told me it was your
reading of the alethiometer

21:15.820 --> 21:17.060
that I'd find impressive.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.300
The truth is...

21:20.740 --> 21:23.100
..it's your obstinacy
that's your gift.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.820
Our task is to protect you, Lyra.

21:28.180 --> 21:32.180
If that means protecting you
and Will, then so be it,

21:32.180 --> 21:34.500
even though this world
makes me very uneasy.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.060
Well, you should be uneasy.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.180
There's creatures here.

21:41.180 --> 21:44.020
They don't hurt children,
but they could hurt you.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.940
We will help you find
Will's father...

21:47.100 --> 21:49.540
..but we need to stop
Will's bleeding first.

22:30.620 --> 22:32.180
Please tell me he'll be all right.

22:33.740 --> 22:35.300
We've done all we can here.

22:40.500 --> 22:44.020
Your alethiometer - where does it
say to find his father?

23:04.380 --> 23:06.140
Up.

23:06.140 --> 23:07.660
Keep going up.

23:07.660 --> 23:08.820
That's all it says.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.980
Stay close to him.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.420
He'll be cold tonight.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.780
We'll continue up the mountain
in the morning.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.220
We feel safe here...

23:29.420 --> 23:30.740
..don't we?

23:39.780 --> 23:41.060
Ahem.

23:46.140 --> 23:47.700
Fra Pavel.

23:49.020 --> 23:52.380
I have consulted the alethiometer
as you've asked.

23:52.380 --> 23:55.460
I don't entirely understand
what I've seen.

23:55.460 --> 23:58.980
Perhaps if you tell me, we shall
understand it better together.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.340
May I speak freely?

24:00.340 --> 24:03.180
Even though I should rightly be
punished for such words.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.940
Whatever it is...

24:06.140 --> 24:09.740
..it has come from the
alethiometer, am I right?

24:09.740 --> 24:10.820
You are.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.380
So why should you be punished
for telling me something

24:15.380 --> 24:18.060
which you in turn have been told?

24:19.460 --> 24:20.820
Go ahead.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.340
Mrs Coulter is looking
for her child.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.700
The girl has gone
into another world.

24:32.020 --> 24:36.620
Before Asriel opened the hole in the
sky, Mrs Coulter came to see me.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.700
There was something
she wanted me to ask.

24:43.540 --> 24:45.460
What was the question?

24:45.460 --> 24:47.140
Who is Lyra Belacqua?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.340
And?

24:49.340 --> 24:52.140
I've discovered the girl
has another name.

24:52.140 --> 24:53.940
The witches know it from a prophecy.

24:53.940 --> 24:55.380
It's heresy, beyond doubt.

24:55.380 --> 24:56.700
You are not a heretic.

24:56.700 --> 25:00.660
Repeat what you have learned
and waste me no more time.

25:00.660 --> 25:02.540
I rather fear you have
become Cardinal

25:02.540 --> 25:05.020
at the most burdensome of times.
Tell me what you know.

25:06.140 --> 25:08.180
The name is her destiny.

25:08.180 --> 25:11.380
It foretells she will be in the
position of the one

25:11.380 --> 25:13.660
who brought about our downfall.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.380
Mother of us all.

25:16.380 --> 25:17.580
Cause of all sin.

25:18.740 --> 25:21.180
What is the child's name?

25:21.180 --> 25:23.340
The alethiometer does not forecast.

25:23.340 --> 25:26.180
If it comes about that she is
tempted by the serpent,

25:26.180 --> 25:29.060
then it is likely she will fall,
and Dust and sin will triumph.

25:29.060 --> 25:31.740
The name, Fra Pavel.

25:33.260 --> 25:34.660
Speak the name.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.820
You know this place.

25:43.980 --> 25:46.740
You really have no sense
of where Lyra might be?

25:48.220 --> 25:49.580
I know it a little.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.660
Why are you so nervous?

26:03.060 --> 26:04.220
Well, it's just...

26:05.300 --> 26:08.460
..the Spectres have multiplied
since Asriel tore the sky.

26:08.460 --> 26:11.700
Ugh. One minute this place is
empty, the next it isn't.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.340
And then it's too late.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.820
They didn't get you.
You managed to get back.

26:15.820 --> 26:18.420
Only because I ran.
Oh, yes, you were frightened.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.660
I need to find her and, in turn,

26:21.660 --> 26:24.140
you will get the boy
with the Subtle Knife.

27:04.180 --> 27:07.060
It's almost like Spectres
sever their victims.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.740
They don't sever, these Spectres.

27:15.220 --> 27:18.580
It's stronger than that,
whatever they do.

27:18.580 --> 27:20.020
We could learn from this.

27:26.180 --> 27:27.940
I have been praying.

27:31.060 --> 27:35.540
And I believe that we have yet to
understand our true purpose.

27:37.460 --> 27:43.620
But today the Authority himself
has spoken to me.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.500
This Magisterium...

27:49.380 --> 27:56.540
..the Magisterium over which
I am Cardinal, has a new direction.

27:57.820 --> 27:58.980
Fra Pavel...

28:00.540 --> 28:04.940
..has brought me information
of a threat so grave in nature...

28:06.580 --> 28:09.260
..that the world
has only seen it once before.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.140
Under my leadership...

28:14.500 --> 28:17.420
..we will do whatever is necessary.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.940
We have sent troops
through the anomaly...

28:22.140 --> 28:23.620
..to face that threat.

28:23.620 --> 28:24.980
Yes, Cardinal.

28:28.620 --> 28:31.180
In the name of the Authority...

28:33.220 --> 28:34.900
..we will not waver.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.500
And the first to partake

28:42.500 --> 28:45.420
of this great sacrifice...

28:48.300 --> 28:49.900
..will be the child...

28:51.180 --> 28:52.660
..Lyra Belacqua.

28:59.980 --> 29:02.780
It's holding up,
the spell worked.

29:02.780 --> 29:05.820
A wound caused by magic
must be closed by magic.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.060
I've done my best.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.460
She's lost a lot, for one so young.

29:17.940 --> 29:19.580
I know that.

29:19.580 --> 29:20.700
Tell him.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.940
She's important, Will.

29:30.940 --> 29:33.780
There's a prophecy surrounding Lyra,

29:33.780 --> 29:38.020
a prophecy that includes a boy
who must travel with her.

29:38.020 --> 29:41.820
I don't know whether
you're that boy.

29:41.820 --> 29:43.820
She thinks you're her
responsibility.

29:45.060 --> 29:49.060
Don't lose sight of the fact
that she's your responsibility, too.

29:49.060 --> 29:50.700
She must be protected.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.900
Marisa.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.700
Those are the Spectres?

32:51.700 --> 32:54.620
There's a swarm of them down there!

32:54.620 --> 32:56.980
Yes, that's them.

32:56.980 --> 32:59.540
If they're that close to the tower,
then the knife isn't there.

33:00.780 --> 33:03.700
We should land. Lyra could be
down there in danger.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.020
The Spectres would seize us
immediately.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.940
They can't get us up here.

33:07.940 --> 33:09.540
What if Lyra's there?

33:09.540 --> 33:11.740
Don't worry,
the Spectres feed on Dust.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.860
Children are not attractive to them.

33:13.860 --> 33:16.500
As soon as adulthood comes,
they'll be there.

33:16.500 --> 33:20.020
We will help everyone
and Lyra by finding the bearer.

33:20.020 --> 33:24.020
If we die, we're of no help
and we can do no further good.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.100
Take us further up.

33:28.100 --> 33:32.020
Over the forest.
The knife bearer is not in the city.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.020
What's that noise?

33:38.780 --> 33:41.260
What do you see?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.660
Magisterium airships.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.140
I didn't think they'd be allowed
to cross the worlds.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.740
Keep us flying.
The wind will be on our side.

34:08.540 --> 34:09.900
Go...

34:17.660 --> 34:19.060
You can control them.

34:24.380 --> 34:25.980
Isn't it wonderful?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.780
Let's celebrate.

34:38.140 --> 34:40.940
Do you think Angelica and Paola
will be all right?

34:42.220 --> 34:44.420
I don't think they were as bad
as we thought.

34:46.940 --> 34:48.460
Although I was scared.

34:50.540 --> 34:53.820
I've never seen children
act like that before.

34:53.820 --> 34:55.180
I have.

35:00.860 --> 35:02.060
My mum.

35:03.540 --> 35:04.740
Every now and again,

35:04.740 --> 35:07.540
she'd start thinking things
that weren't true.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.660
Doing stuff that didn't make sense.

35:12.900 --> 35:16.180
Like...touching the railings
in the park or...

35:17.540 --> 35:19.540
..counting the bricks in the wall.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.700
Stuff like that.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.060
These boys found out.

35:25.060 --> 35:26.300
They were mean.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.860
For no reason.

35:31.020 --> 35:32.980
They were worse than Angelica.

35:37.580 --> 35:38.980
When I was younger...

35:40.700 --> 35:43.260
..I used to pretend that my dad
was some place abroad...

35:44.980 --> 35:47.820
..and that one day I'd go get him.

35:47.820 --> 35:49.700
He'd have the answer to everything.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.300
And I could go to school.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.460
Have friends.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.140
But the older I got...

35:58.140 --> 35:59.820
The more you stopped believing that.

35:59.820 --> 36:01.140
Yeah.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.020
I couldn't trust anyone.

36:07.340 --> 36:08.700
Till you met me.

36:12.180 --> 36:13.580
Yeah.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.380
Another?

36:55.260 --> 36:56.500
Hmm.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.180
Tell me something.

36:59.740 --> 37:02.860
I will tell you anything you like.

37:02.860 --> 37:04.180
How do you control them?

37:04.180 --> 37:06.380
Well, they consume
what makes us human,

37:06.380 --> 37:10.020
so I just...hid that from them.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.420
I suppressed myself.

37:16.020 --> 37:19.780
Marisa, with that ability,

37:19.780 --> 37:22.060
we can go wherever we please
in this city.

37:22.060 --> 37:26.460
Yes, I can find Lyra,
and you can finally find the boy,

37:26.460 --> 37:29.780
and the knife is yours. Ours!

37:29.780 --> 37:31.420
You understand?

37:31.420 --> 37:34.100
It has a power that could
be useful for both of us.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.900
And I would like an equal
to share it all with.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.380
You think me your equal?

37:46.900 --> 37:48.340
In every way.

37:57.340 --> 38:00.300
Then let's
drink to that.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.660
The Subtle Knife of Cittagazze -

38:18.660 --> 38:22.020
not even the makers
know what it can do.

38:22.020 --> 38:25.260
No-one is invulnerable to it.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.380
Matter.

38:31.540 --> 38:32.740
Air.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.420
Go on.

38:39.660 --> 38:40.980
This place...

38:42.580 --> 38:44.380
..the window.

38:44.380 --> 38:46.140
All the things you've kept from me.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.420
It would have been so much easier

38:49.420 --> 38:51.900
if you'd told me about Lyra
when you first had her.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.700
You did so much for me.
Don't think I don't know that.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.980
But your ambitions were small.

39:01.980 --> 39:04.820
They would have always ended here.

39:08.460 --> 39:11.060
Boreal, I don't need you.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.500
You would only hold me back.

39:20.380 --> 39:24.740
You are not, nor have
you ever been, my equal.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.540
What have you...done?

39:32.780 --> 39:34.540
Don't fight it. Don't fight it.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.700
Goodbye, old friend.

40:15.420 --> 40:17.540
Mr Jopari, you remember
that problem I mentioned?

40:17.540 --> 40:19.340
It's grown more urgent.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.620
Yes.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.820
Yes? That's all you're saying?

40:23.820 --> 40:25.540
Yes?

40:25.540 --> 40:27.740
They're faster than us.

40:27.740 --> 40:30.060
They were always going to
catch up at some point.

40:30.060 --> 40:31.820
Well, now is not a good point.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.140
We've no defences,

40:34.140 --> 40:36.420
which means that
we've got to set down.

40:36.420 --> 40:38.460
The only way is into that valley.

40:38.460 --> 40:39.940
Do the best you can.

40:42.420 --> 40:46.260
Open your eyes and wake up!
We're not playing around.

40:46.260 --> 40:47.940
Do you need wind?

40:47.940 --> 40:50.580
No, they can use wind as easy as us,
and they're built for speed.

40:52.540 --> 40:53.940
Do you need a storm?

40:53.940 --> 40:56.660
Is that all you can summon,
the weather? You're a shaman.

40:56.660 --> 40:59.380
Shaman us up some big guns
and some iron cladding.

41:05.940 --> 41:09.100
Are you summoning a storm? Because
I can't pilot well in a storm!

41:09.100 --> 41:11.260
I trust your skill.

41:19.420 --> 41:20.940
Can we trust him?

41:20.940 --> 41:22.140
Do we have another choice?

41:23.460 --> 41:26.420
I guess these are the cards we've
been dealt. It's time to play 'em.

41:26.420 --> 41:27.980
For Lyra?

41:27.980 --> 41:30.460
For Lyra.

42:06.140 --> 42:07.820
Will, the knife! Lyra!

42:28.740 --> 42:29.900
Mm.

42:50.740 --> 42:52.540
Strength is salvation.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.140
Hmm.

43:03.980 --> 43:05.780
Remember that.

43:09.940 --> 43:11.380
Whoo!

43:11.380 --> 43:14.780
You cook up a fine storm,
Mr Jopari.

43:14.780 --> 43:16.820
There's still two more!

43:16.820 --> 43:18.580
Get down!

44:05.700 --> 44:07.260
It's turning!

44:14.500 --> 44:16.700
The gas canister!

44:23.340 --> 44:25.060
Hold on!
