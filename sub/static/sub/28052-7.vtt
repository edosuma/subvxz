Billy May Dempsey,

20:40.789 --> 20:44.867
on your 2003 PBL Championship!

20:44.868 --> 20:48.355
Billy May, how did you get to be
such a darn good bowler?

20:48.889 --> 20:52.111
Well, it's all just mathematics, really.

20:52.112 --> 20:53.793
A man of few words, as always.

20:53.794 --> 20:57.463
And since I was a kid,
my father would go off

20:57.464 --> 20:59.798
on these benders for weeks at a time.

20:59.799 --> 21:02.860
And he'd keep my sister and me
locked in the basement

21:02.861 --> 21:05.204
so no one would know he'd left us there

21:05.205 --> 21:07.668
and try to come take us away.

21:07.669 --> 21:10.641
And I'd pick up these little pebbles

21:10.642 --> 21:12.945
and try to throw them through the window

21:12.946 --> 21:15.322
and hit a street sign across the alley,

21:15.323 --> 21:18.060
try and get somebody's
attention, anyone's.

21:18.061 --> 21:19.552
Bring us food.

21:19.553 --> 21:22.910
Bring us to a government building.

21:22.911 --> 21:28.027
But no one lived around there,
so no one heard.

21:28.028 --> 21:31.899
So, yeah, I guess to the kids
out there, just practice.

21:33.076 --> 21:34.257
Wow!

21:34.258 --> 21:36.842
Okay, here's the trophy.

21:36.843 --> 21:38.001
There it is!

21:38.002 --> 21:40.374
[Cheers and applause]

21:45.128 --> 21:47.563
- Frigging 10 pin.
- Frigging 10 pin.

21:47.564 --> 21:49.143
Wouldn't go down.

21:49.144 --> 21:51.317
What are you gonna do?

21:51.318 --> 21:52.785
Me and my dad have
actually been spending

21:52.786 --> 21:56.000
a little more time together
working on our relationship.

21:56.001 --> 21:57.516
I mean, my dad is the king.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.635
That's just how it's always gonna be.

21:59.636 --> 22:01.530
And if he's the king,

22:01.531 --> 22:04.276
I guess that makes me a prince,

22:04.277 --> 22:06.508
a rebel prince.

22:06.509 --> 22:11.131

22:11.132 --> 22:13.206
Billy: Yup,
after the championship,

22:13.207 --> 22:15.908
Paula thought I might have
some emotional issues

22:15.909 --> 22:19.017
I hadn't dealt with,
so I started seeing a therapist,

22:19.018 --> 22:23.848
and it helped for a while.

22:23.849 --> 22:26.532
But I realized that working
out my problems

22:26.533 --> 22:28.175
was hurting my bowling and my pétanque,

22:28.176 --> 22:30.469
so I stopped going.

22:30.470 --> 22:32.126
I can't have that.

22:33.479 --> 22:34.313
Larry: I guess, I was just hoping

22:34.314 --> 22:36.336
it would be different this time around,

22:36.337 --> 22:40.010
you know, that I would actually
get to be the comeback kid.

22:40.011 --> 22:41.767
Then I realized, you know,

22:41.768 --> 22:45.132
maybe not everyone is cut out
for professional sports.

22:45.133 --> 22:47.121
I just kind of like regular bowling.

22:47.122 --> 22:48.938
It's a fun game you can play
with your friends,

22:48.939 --> 22:52.336
and everybody can have a good time.

22:52.337 --> 22:55.757
Anybody can win, even me.

22:55.758 --> 22:57.746
All right! All right!
All right! All right!

22:57.747 --> 23:00.520
Aw, we're having a good time!
[Laughs]

23:06.523 --> 23:08.593
Oh! Not so bad.

23:08.594 --> 23:10.006
All right!
You're doing all right!

23:10.007 --> 23:11.569
Come here, man. Nice.
