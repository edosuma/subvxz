That's the fact.

of the FDNY.

Which is why you weren't cuffed
when we hauled you in here.

You were supposed to call me
before reaching out to Karen.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.388
I know.
It's just the, uh...

12:17.432 --> 12:19.695

12:19.739 --> 12:21.001
they caught me off guard.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.829
Doesn't give you a right
to threaten your family.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.961
You're right.
I lost my head.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.181

12:27.224 --> 12:29.792
Warren's P.O. says
he's been the model parolee.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.055
Well, I'm sure his soon-to-be
ex-wife would say different.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.491
Well, I put Karen through a lot.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.363
I don't blame her
if she gives up on me.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.017
So why the meltdown today?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.583

12:40.934 --> 12:42.805
I can live
with losing my marriage,

12:42.849 --> 12:45.242
but not my son--
he means everything to me.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.680
You gonna tell
my parole officer?

12:48.724 --> 12:49.812

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
Fine.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.824
I won't tell him this time.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.260
But no more shenanigans.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.001
You've got my word.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.528
Thank you.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.226
What was that?What was what?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.836
You guys were
acting all chummy.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.230
You acted like more of a
social worker than a cop.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.841
I'm not here as a cop.
My job is to get

13:18.885 --> 13:20.843
the best possible outcome
for this family.
[sighs]

13:20.887 --> 13:23.759
Well, my job is
to enforce the law.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.982
You've gone over
that arrest report

13:29.025 --> 13:31.114
a dozen times.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.116
Troy asks the suspect
to lower the rear window,

13:33.160 --> 13:35.815
and there was a single vial
right there on the seat.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.077
So?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.993
No drugs on him
or anywhere else in the car.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.995
Again, so?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.561
So it's pretty convenient.

13:43.605 --> 13:47.522
Drug dealers have been known
to carry drugs, Jamie.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.524
In plain view on the back seat?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.222
So he was careless.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.617
And we did find a gun
that killed two people.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.271
So there's that.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.056
When Troy reached in the car, he
turned so that his body camera

14:00.100 --> 14:01.492
faced away from the vehicle.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.972
Are you sure
you didn't see anything?

14:03.016 --> 14:06.410
I saw Troy reaching in the back
and pulling out a vial,

14:06.454 --> 14:08.978
and that gave us cause
to search a vehicle

14:09.022 --> 14:11.111
that had a gun under the seat

14:11.154 --> 14:13.765
that was used
in a double homicide.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.812
That's all you saw?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.207
With these two eyes, yes.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.383
Okay, pretend
it's two years ago.

You and I are still riding

have noticed?

If Troy played fast
and loose with this,

Because if I can't get
to the bottom of it,

14:37.789 --> 14:38.921
I have to make a phone call.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.888
same as the alleged
shooter that you collared.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.455
Well, no, it's not the same.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.108
Phelps is a murderer.

21:24.152 --> 21:27.416
And Troy has given his life
to this department.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.852
You're right.
It's not the same.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.245
Troy's worse.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.595
Well, how do you figure that?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.162
Because he took an oath.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.338
Because when you put on the
uniform, you ask the public

21:36.382 --> 21:38.601
to entrust you with
upholding the law,

21:38.645 --> 21:40.908
so you should know better.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.086
The same goes for anyone
who covers for him.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.181
[clears throat]

21:53.224 --> 21:54.878
Detective Reagan,
what are you doing here?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.489
I could ask you
the same thing.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.229
You do realize
you're in violation

21:58.273 --> 21:59.535
of the order of
protection, correct?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.972
No, no, no. I got a message
from Karen at work,

22:02.016 --> 22:03.365
and she asked me
to come over.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.540
I'm sure she did.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.499
I'm serious.
You got to believe me.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.804
Doesn't matter what I believe.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.110
You're under arrest. Let's go.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.285
Hands against the car.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.460
What are you...?Just go.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.462
Right now!

22:19.294 --> 22:21.078
Turn around.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.124
Stay right here.

22:24.952 --> 22:28.042
Let me guess. You just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

22:28.085 --> 22:31.132
Warren texted me,
said Karen wanted to meet.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.483
I called Karen,
she knew nothing about it.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.833
Yeah, sounds like
your boy made it up.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.400
Or someone sent a fake message

22:38.444 --> 22:40.620
so he'd violate
his order of protection.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.056
Well, that sounds like something

22:42.099 --> 22:43.884
you'dprobably do
back in your glory days.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.407
More than once.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.366
But setting people up
is the kind of thing

22:47.409 --> 22:48.845
you can get busted for.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.847
Is that a threat?

22:50.891 --> 22:53.372
You take him in based
on a fixed setup?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.417
It's a promise.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
[chuckles]

22:59.813 --> 23:01.815
Okay.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.295
But if he kills his wife,
it's on you.

23:04.339 --> 23:07.864
Get the hell out of here. Now!

23:07.908 --> 23:09.431
Stay away.

23:11.825 --> 23:12.652
[car door closes]

23:18.571 --> 23:20.050
When?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.617
GORMLEY:
About an hour
and a half ago.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.446
Apparently, both our guys and
their guys started jawboning

23:24.490 --> 23:27.536
at each other, but the
bosses on scene got ahold

23:27.580 --> 23:29.016
before anything physical
started.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.410
And we can assume
that the cell phones were out

23:31.453 --> 23:34.456
and that the jawboning'll be
all bleeps on the 5:00 news.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.459
I got nothing but bleeps
for this right now.BAKER: But they were able

23:37.503 --> 23:40.419
to secure the scene together
without any real incident?Yes.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.986
Yeah. This time.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.554
Look, walk down the street,

23:45.598 --> 23:48.035
and ask anyone the name
of the police commissioner

23:48.078 --> 23:49.950
and the fire commissioner,
what do you get?

23:49.993 --> 23:50.994
BAKER:
"Frank Reagan,"

23:51.038 --> 23:52.039
and, "I don't know."

23:52.082 --> 23:53.562
Exactly. Look,
I'd have a chip

23:53.606 --> 23:56.260
on my shoulder, too, if I was
"Commissioner I Don't Know."

23:56.304 --> 23:58.262
So would any of you.So what?

23:58.306 --> 24:00.656
Well, Lieutenant, we are going

24:00.700 --> 24:04.878
to do something about this thing
with our guys and their guys

24:04.921 --> 24:07.707
before it spills out
onto the street.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.666
Okay, but what about our guy?Our hockey player?

24:10.710 --> 24:12.668
Yeah. We gonna just let him
hang out to dry?

24:12.712 --> 24:14.975
This tradition--

24:15.018 --> 24:18.761
I know the rank and file likes
to play it on both sides--

24:18.805 --> 24:20.589
but I got nothing for it.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.765
So... what?

24:22.809 --> 24:24.985
We ask him
to take one for the team.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.987
JAMIE:
You've been

24:27.030 --> 24:28.467
interviewed
with IAB before.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.513
Yeah, but not with my
partner's career on the line.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.950
You should be worried
about your own career here.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.213
I have you to
thank for that.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.519
I did my job, Eddie.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.173
And it could cost me mine.

24:39.216 --> 24:41.001
IAB is looking
at Troy, not you.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.785
Like that matters.Of course it matters.

24:42.829 --> 24:46.180
Really? I tell IAB the truth--
I didn't see anything--

24:46.223 --> 24:49.183
and Troy still goes down,
I come out smelling like a rat.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.142
Maybe to a few knuckleheads.

24:53.448 --> 24:57.060
Troy has been in that
precinct for 12 years, Jamie.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.976
If he loses his shield,
they're gonna blame that on me.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.500
I did not create
the situation, Eddie.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.979
I did not plant that evidence.

25:03.023 --> 25:05.286
You just called IAB.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.295
[door opens]

25:14.338 --> 25:15.905
[sets cup down]

25:15.949 --> 25:17.341
[door closes]

25:20.170 --> 25:21.476
Hey.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.869
Hey.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.876
Is everything all right?

25:29.919 --> 25:33.140
Yeah, just...
work stuff.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.534
Work stuff about
you running for D.A.?

25:37.144 --> 25:39.102
How did you find out?

25:39.146 --> 25:40.103
[laughs]

25:40.147 --> 25:41.931
Hey, I know guys who know guys.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.586
I thought it was
supposed to be confidential.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.109
Well, by normal
standards, it is,

25:46.153 --> 25:49.156
but one guy knew one
other guy who knew.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.943
[sighs] I wanted to come
to you with it right away.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.076
But you didn't.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.078
I just felt like
it was a decision

25:58.121 --> 25:59.688
I should make on my own.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.691
And I respect that.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.217
I've wanted this my whole life.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.002
Actually, you wanted
to be a jockey

26:09.045 --> 26:10.786
till you were nine years old.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.788
Well, I was already
five-seven by then.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.311
And allergic to horses.

26:14.355 --> 26:18.228
Okay, I have wanted this
my entire adultlife.

26:18.272 --> 26:22.276
And it's past time
that Manhattan has a female D.A.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.279
Well, I think
you'd make a great one.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.802
Nothing to do with gender.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.848
Thank you.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.893
Yeah.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.418
Something to think about.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.246
It is

26:36.290 --> 26:39.119
definitely gonna
turn up the heat around here.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.251
I thought you and I have done
a good job

26:41.295 --> 26:43.645
checking our guns at the door
since I became bureau chief.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.473
Yes,

26:45.516 --> 26:47.606
but there is the rest
of the family.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.174
What do you mean?

26:51.218 --> 26:53.655
Well, they've lived
in the public eye

26:53.699 --> 26:55.614
for as long as I can remember,

26:55.657 --> 26:57.659
but you choose to stand

26:57.703 --> 26:59.618
for public office.

27:00.923 --> 27:04.013
The scrutiny will go
through the roof. I know.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.494
Look, it's your decision,

27:06.537 --> 27:08.627
as it should be.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.326
We'll support what you do.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.374
JANKO:
Wow.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.159
District attorney.
Oh!
All right, Erin.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.161
[overlapping chatter]

27:21.204 --> 27:22.945
Look at you.I appreciate the support,

27:22.989 --> 27:25.208
but I haven't made
a decision yet.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.253
Well, what the heck
are you waiting for?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.863
It's a job
you were born to do.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.996
HENRY: Yeah.Be nice to have a friend
to cops in that office.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.475
For once.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.956
It's a complicated
decision for all of us.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.610
What do you mean,
all of us?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.568
Well...

27:37.612 --> 27:39.701
a lot of hard
questions get asked,

27:39.745 --> 27:41.964
and the answers get checked
and double-checked.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.619
Folks sticking their noses
where they don't belong.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.970
And nothing's out of bounds,
and I mean nothing.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.929
Yeah, but we've all dealt
with the press before.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.018
It's not the press.
They're at least visible.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.759
It's the opposition research,

27:53.802 --> 27:55.195
stuff on any
and all of us

27:55.238 --> 27:57.588
that can just surface
out of nowhere.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.199
So, you're telling me
that the Russians

27:59.242 --> 28:01.244
are gonna be making
stuff up about me online?

28:01.288 --> 28:04.334
I doubt it, but before
I make a decision,

28:04.378 --> 28:07.598
I would like to know
that you guys are all on board.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.122
100%.JANKO: Yeah.
Yeah.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.253
Of course.JANKO: Yeah.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.254
On board.And if there's

28:11.298 --> 28:13.169
anything I should know,

28:13.213 --> 28:14.954
anything that could
raise a red flag,

28:14.997 --> 28:16.651
now would be the time.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.307
You mean like my dad
being a convicted felon?

28:20.350 --> 28:22.439
Well, that's already
out in the open.

28:22.483 --> 28:23.789
Could it hurt you?

28:23.832 --> 28:24.920
I doubt it.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.401
And that's on him, not on you.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.446
Yeah.I got accused
of roughing up a clown

28:29.490 --> 28:32.058
who doused some cops with water,
which made all the news.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.277
Well, that guy only got half
of what he had coming to him.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.496
And again, it's known.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.411
HENRY:
Yeah.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.456
Cat got your tongue?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.894
I'm thinking.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.243
This may take a while.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.853
Well, you all know

28:44.897 --> 28:47.464
I may have stepped on the line
once or twice in my career.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.858
And Dillinger robbed a bank
one or two times.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.078
Hey, I'll stack Danny's record

28:52.121 --> 28:53.601
against any detective
on the job.

28:53.644 --> 28:54.776
Thank you, Dad.
Mm.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.517
And I have a clear conscience
about it,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.301
so I say you should go for it.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.522
Grandpa, anything I should know?

29:01.565 --> 29:02.958
I'll take the Fifth.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.090
FRANK: Hmm.Oh.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.439
Does a fake I.D. count?

29:05.482 --> 29:06.440
What?

29:06.483 --> 29:08.442
I think you're okay.

29:08.485 --> 29:10.357
Hopefully, yours is better
than your dad's.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.141
What?
Oh.JAMIE: Yeah. What was

29:12.185 --> 29:14.230
the name on that thing?"Marion Morrison."

29:14.274 --> 29:16.450
ALL:
Marion?

29:16.493 --> 29:17.712
JANKO:
Seriously?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.409
It's John Wayne's name
in real life.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.671
Who?

29:20.715 --> 29:22.978
That's sad.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.806
And if those are the only

29:24.850 --> 29:26.590
skeletons in the
closet, you know what?

29:26.634 --> 29:29.506
I'd say you're good to go.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.552
DANNY:
Yeah.

29:31.595 --> 29:32.553
Yes.HENRY:
Good to go.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.163
Do it.Thank you, everyone.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.686
Pass the potatoes, Marion.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.559
[laughter]

29:39.603 --> 29:41.431
DANNY:
Well, Gramps,

29:41.475 --> 29:44.565
I sure hope your boy Davis
is behaving himself.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.393
I'll take his behavior
over yours.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.439
Wait for me in the car.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.489
Do you mind telling me
what happened to Henry Reagan?

29:55.532 --> 29:57.578
'Cause this bleeding heart
I've been riding

29:57.621 --> 30:00.102
around with the last few days--
I have no idea who he is.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.496
Domestic violence cases
are loaded with landmines.

30:02.539 --> 30:03.497
Uh-huh.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.499
You got to walk softly.

30:05.542 --> 30:06.848
Well, I know that, Gramps.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.458
That's exactly my point.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.243
You know, this isn't
my first rodeo.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.680
Problem is, you're acting like
the bull and not the rider.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.464
But if this guy Davis
goes off on his wife,

30:14.508 --> 30:15.726
he could do serious damage.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.511
He's never hurt
anyone in his life.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.426
But if he goes
back to jail,

30:19.469 --> 30:21.123
it'll do some real damage
to his son.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.646
Well, I think he should have
thought about that

30:22.690 --> 30:23.909
before he became a junkie.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.388
Look, Gramps,

30:25.432 --> 30:27.826
I became a cop in
the first place because of you

30:27.869 --> 30:29.653
and the stories you told
about the old days

30:29.697 --> 30:31.177
when cops didn't look
over their shoulders,

30:31.220 --> 30:32.918
and they did
what they had to do.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.745
Watching you work this case
makes me wish

30:34.789 --> 30:37.487
I'd kept those stories
to myself.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.623
Well, if that's how you feel,

30:42.666 --> 30:44.625
I'll ride solo on the Davis case
from here on in.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.496
I'll do the same.Good.

This is all my fault.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.643
What-what happened?
What's your fault?

31:02.686 --> 31:04.863
I went to pick up Andrew
from soccer practice,

31:04.906 --> 31:07.474
and his coach said that
Warren had already taken him.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.823
Taken him where?I don't know.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.216
And I've been calling
their cell phones,

31:10.259 --> 31:11.870
and neither one of them
is picking up.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.828
Well, didn't the teachers know
about the order of protection?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.830
Well, with everything going on,
I didn't have a chance.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.571
I can't believe
this is happening.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.138
Wait a minute. Wait.
It's not your fault, okay?

31:19.181 --> 31:20.922
What I need you to do
is take a breath.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.924
All right? I'm gonna have this
officer take your complaint.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.926
I promise you I'll find him.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.929
Go ahead.Right this way.

31:31.977 --> 31:32.803
You heard?

31:32.847 --> 31:34.718
Yeah.You know,

31:34.762 --> 31:36.851
if he was locked up
like I wanted him to be,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.200
this would never
have happened.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.202
And he wouldn't keep
acting like a perp

31:40.246 --> 31:42.117
if you didn't keep
treating him like one.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.206
[chuckles] So you're
saying this is my fault?

31:44.250 --> 31:47.601
What I'm saying is this guy
is not who you think he is.

31:47.644 --> 31:48.863
I don't give a damn who he is.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.256
I got to go find this guy

31:50.299 --> 31:52.954

he just kidnapped!

31:55.957 --> 31:57.828
Well, do you plan on telling me?

Oh, I thought
we were going solo.

Oh, my God, Gramps.

You drive.

Anything like that?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.112
No, I like to wear clothes
in public.

It's kind of my thing.

he's been waiting to air?

32:24.029 --> 32:26.205
We've aired them all, so no.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.902
Daughter Nicky, any skeletons?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.904
Not that I know of.This is all about

32:29.948 --> 32:31.514

32:31.558 --> 32:33.081
You can't prevent surprises.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.909
You can only anticipate them.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.085
Right.

A run for anything these days

But the model I made
from researching you

32:42.264 --> 32:43.657
is the best kind.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.311
Between your personal conduct

32:45.354 --> 32:47.052
and the record of service
in your family,

32:47.095 --> 32:49.924
there are offsets for almost any
situation that could rear up.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.752
That's good.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.059
Depends on
what you're looking for.

32:54.102 --> 32:55.669
What does that mean?

32:55.712 --> 32:57.845
Means if you're looking
at the scrutiny

32:57.888 --> 33:00.413
as an excuse
not to pursue the office,

33:00.456 --> 33:02.937
the scrutiny ain't much of one.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.027
Who said I was looking
for an excuse?

33:08.725 --> 33:11.119
Isn't that
what you're doing here?

A cadet could look at that
collar and know something

34:10.874 --> 34:12.137
wasn't right.Yeah, but IAB's

34:12.180 --> 34:13.964
still got to prove it, right?And if they do,

34:14.008 --> 34:16.097
your partner catches the blame.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.491

Phelps killed two people.

Mm-hmm.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.659
Sorry to crash your party.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.445
Sorry to say I'm
getting used to it.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.317
This is Officer Bruce Zarrelli.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.015
Yeah. We've met.

40:53.059 --> 40:54.887
Officer?

40:55.931 --> 40:57.150
Commissioner Rourke,

40:57.193 --> 40:59.544
I overreacted the other night,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.633
and I'm sorry.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.504
Please accept my apologies.

41:05.245 --> 41:07.029
The D.A.'s dropping
the harassment charges.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.814
You can ignore the summons.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.511
You had a hand in that?

41:10.555 --> 41:13.645
It was the right call.

41:13.688 --> 41:18.780
I'm sorry you felt disrespected
by my people.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.304
[inhales, exhales]

41:21.348 --> 41:24.438
[smacks lips]
I should've kept my cool.

41:27.397 --> 41:28.486
Happy birthday.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.707
Should I get the Bomb Squad
to open this?

41:32.751 --> 41:34.709
[laughter]

41:34.753 --> 41:37.407
Commissioner's courtesy card,
with his cell phone number.

41:37.451 --> 41:39.366
If you need him,
give him a call.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.411
Anytime.

41:43.631 --> 41:45.677
Thank you, Frank.

41:46.939 --> 41:49.332
You're welcome.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.638
Just don't share it

41:50.682 --> 41:52.074
with all these guys.

41:52.118 --> 41:54.642
I don't want to get woken up
ten times a night.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.470
[laughter]

42:04.739 --> 42:06.524
Okay.
