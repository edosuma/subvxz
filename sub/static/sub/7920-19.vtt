Hey, what's going on?

00:21.789 --> 00:23.956
Yeah, but that was

I want to ask Reagan
to the wedding,

"Hey, how's your
spring looking?"

01:41.535 --> 01:42.868

No response.

Yeah.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.621
Cece, I need you
to send Reagan a text,

02:02.623 --> 02:04.156
and if she responds,
then we'll know

02:04.158 --> 02:06.458

02:41.428 --> 02:43.829
You told Cece
it was almost done.

I know! I choked

it has to be perfect.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.118
This dress is
gonna be in every

03:06.120 --> 03:08.487
single picture,
and people will say,

03:08.489 --> 03:10.556
"Cece, why do you look so bad?"

03:10.558 --> 03:13.659
Also, "Who is that murdered
woman in the background?"

03:13.661 --> 03:16.361
And the answer to both
will be: Jess.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.563
This is true.
I see this happening

03:17.565 --> 03:19.097
exactly how you described it.

03:20.634 --> 03:21.833
Okay, could not

about the dress!

03:23.037 --> 03:24.336
I'm ahead of schedule.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.470
I'll have it to you
this afternoon.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.538
This afternoon?
Bye!

03:26.540 --> 03:28.507
Oh, my God!
(laughs)

03:28.509 --> 03:29.908
Ah! Why did I say that?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.376
There was no reason
for me to say that.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.845
I can't work like this.
You have to get her out of here.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.681
I can't take my idea walks.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.882
Your idea walks?
How did you become

03:36.884 --> 03:38.250
such an important
part of my life?

03:38.252 --> 03:41.720
When I craft, I like to get
out of my space, bop around.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.689
I use movement
and scenery

03:43.691 --> 03:45.390
to tickle the old idea box,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.226
but I can't do that now,
'cause every ten minutes,

03:47.228 --> 03:49.061
Cece comes in here, like,

03:49.063 --> 03:50.062
"Hey, Jessica, that dress

03:50.064 --> 03:52.364
is gonna be gangbusters,
Polka Dots."

03:52.366 --> 03:54.433
That's a really good Cece.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.734
Also a passable Sinatra.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.169
Jess, what if
I told you

03:57.171 --> 03:58.570
that there was a place...

03:58.572 --> 04:00.205
where you could work in peace.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.410
Um...

04:05.412 --> 04:08.247
Schmidt, this is the men's room
at your office.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.916
Oh, no, this is
my wedding workshop.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.685
See, I'm the only guy
in the building.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.387
Well, except of
course for Brian,

04:15.389 --> 04:17.389
but, you know, I pay Brian
eight dollars a day

04:17.391 --> 04:20.859
to do his poops at the big box
store across the street.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.695
That seems high. When do you do
the work that you get paid for?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.931
Rarely, and it's a problem,
but, you know,

04:25.933 --> 04:27.933
we couldn't afford a planner,
so here we are.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.201
Please,

04:29.203 --> 04:31.203
have a seat at
the Think Sink.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.204
Oh.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.205
Hmm.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.940
Don't mind if I do.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.208
(laughs)

04:36.210 --> 04:37.509
I like its energy.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.445
I will create a dress today.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.747
If you need anything,
just let me know.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.081
Also, there's a fridge stocked

04:43.083 --> 04:44.950
with sparkling water
in stall three.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.952
Jess.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.290
Dang, girl, you ugly.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.127
Come on, mouse,
how about we don't

04:55.129 --> 04:56.194
do this today.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.898
Bishop.
Hmm?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.800
Your fingers really that weak?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.468
How do you button your pants
in the morning?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.636
(laughter)

05:04.638 --> 05:05.637
Honestly, sir,

05:05.639 --> 05:07.472
with, uh, great difficulty.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.473
(laughter)

05:08.475 --> 05:10.142
(Aly chuckles)

05:10.144 --> 05:11.810
You guys should see
Bishop load his gun.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.111
It's like watching

05:13.113 --> 05:14.112
a toddler eat peas.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.947
(laughter)

05:15.949 --> 05:16.948
Fellas,

05:16.950 --> 05:19.284
come on, this is
the LAPD, right?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.919
We can't bring
this city together

05:20.921 --> 05:22.621
if we're tearing
each other apart.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.089
God, you're nice.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.624
You're so nice, Daniels.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.326
Thanks, buddy.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.661
Everybody smells
fantastic, by the way.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.463
Thank you. That's really nice.
Thanks, Daniels.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.231
Very nice;
he<i> is</i> very nice.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.500
(knocking)

05:35.502 --> 05:36.968
You wanted to see me, Kim?
Schmidt.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.004
Why did you copy me
on all these e-mails

05:39.006 --> 05:40.439
you sent planning your wedding?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.174
What?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.678
Oh. (clears throat)

05:46.680 --> 05:47.679
Darn it.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.281
Sorry about that.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.450
Um, Kim is actually
also the name

05:51.452 --> 05:53.185
of our chef's
new assistant.

05:53.187 --> 05:57.155
To your florist: "Beaming over
the peony centerpieces.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.125
No chance
I'll get work done today."

06:00.127 --> 06:01.126
To your DJ:

06:01.128 --> 06:03.028
"Fat Wet Beats..."

06:03.030 --> 06:04.329
FWB.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.064
"...what about a swing theme
for cocktail hour?

06:06.066 --> 06:09.034
I'll spend the day
brainstorming tracks. Out."

06:09.036 --> 06:10.635
I'm no longer with
Fat Wet Beats.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.037
We had a few
conversations,

06:12.039 --> 06:13.705
and he was being
a straight-up ho.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.006
Is this what you've been doing

06:15.008 --> 06:16.141
instead of the regional
brand report?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.609
It was due three days ago.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.847
That. Yes.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.483
Of course, I'm gonna
have that to you in...

06:24.485 --> 06:26.184
Why are you sm... why you
smiling at me like that?

06:26.186 --> 06:28.387
I'm imagining what it would
be like to fire you.

06:28.389 --> 06:29.388
The same feeling

06:29.390 --> 06:30.722
I had when we unplugged

06:30.724 --> 06:32.657
my mother-in-law.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.927
Beep, beep, beep...

06:42.236 --> 06:44.503
Is that legal in California?

06:44.505 --> 06:45.704
You've been warned.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.272
If I catch you
doing anything at all

06:47.274 --> 06:50.675
related to your wedding,
you are out.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.911
Jess, Jess,
you got to get out of here.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.980
J-Jess.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.417
Oh, dear Lord.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.589
So Aly said that she wanted to
keep things normal at work...

07:04.591 --> 07:05.857
Okay.
...but then

07:05.859 --> 07:08.927
she ripped me in front
of everyone, dude.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.095
Isn't ripping you what Aly does?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.097
Yes, but we're
a couple now, man.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.932
I'm flummoxed.
What should I do?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.100
Should I say something?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.101
No, don't communicate.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.369
It's not gonna get you anywhere.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.371
What you got to do is
you got to follow her lead.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.939
Got to play the game,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.607
like I'm doing with Reagan.
I'm play-- Hey, Cece?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.743
Mm? Uh, did Reagan
text you back yet?

07:24.745 --> 07:26.778
In the past three minutes? No.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.047
Son of a bi--
Okay, you know what? Plan B.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.549
I'm texting her from my burner.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.384
Hmm?
Why do you have a burner phone?

07:32.386 --> 07:34.119
That's an insane question, dude.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.388
(laughs)

07:36.390 --> 07:37.456
That's not an answer.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.790
A burner is crazy.
Look, if Reagan

07:38.792 --> 07:40.559
had her phone, she would
have texted me back.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.627
She's probably on a plane
or in a spa or...

07:42.629 --> 07:43.695
(phone blips)

07:44.765 --> 07:46.765
Well, she just responded.
What?!

07:46.767 --> 07:48.099
I said, "What are you
doing for dinner?"

07:48.101 --> 07:49.968
and she just texted back,
"Who dis?"

07:49.970 --> 07:53.271
So I'm gonna text,
"Who you think dis is?"

07:53.273 --> 07:54.473
(laughs)

07:54.475 --> 07:56.141
So now we play the waiting game.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.375
(phone blips)

07:57.911 --> 07:59.845
"Karen"?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.079
She thinks I'm Karen.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.115
Oh, yeah, I can be Karen.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.784
And Karen's gonna
get some answers.

08:05.786 --> 08:09.754
You know, as a cop, I find
this to be very disturbing.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.590
But as a friend...
(chuckles)

08:11.592 --> 08:13.291
man, this is
straight-up delicious.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.292
Mmm!

08:14.294 --> 08:15.060
(slurping)

08:20.100 --> 08:21.466
Oh!

08:21.468 --> 08:23.001
(Winston laughs)

08:23.003 --> 08:25.136
Sit much, dummy?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.137
(laughs):
Look at her.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.772
(laughing)
Thank you.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.341
She's so stupid.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.842
What?
What the hell was that?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.010
Just being normal.
(laughs)

08:32.012 --> 08:34.112
That was not normal.
I'm sorry, okay?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.447
I don't know
how to act around you.

08:35.449 --> 08:36.648
I can't kiss you.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.849
I can't prank you.
(sighs)

08:37.851 --> 08:39.451
I can't keep this bottled up.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.119
Winnie needs an outlet.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.456
I know, I know,
we're incredibly sexual people.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.325
That's right.
But if we try...

08:47.327 --> 08:49.928
we can keep our hands
off of each other.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.765
(quiet laugh)

09:03.210 --> 09:06.144
There is that hand
I was looking for.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.178
Good job, Officer.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.179
Yeah.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.214
Hey, Daniels.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.882
Hey. DANIELS: Hey, guys.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.052
TGI Thursday, am I right?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.186
Okay.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.922
As you were.

09:18.492 --> 09:19.524
(sighs)

09:19.526 --> 09:21.226
That was close.

09:22.496 --> 09:23.762
He saw us.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.498
Ooh, uh, P-Penelope.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.233
Have you seen a girl
wandering around?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.702
Um, look-looks like
a drawing of a best friend

09:30.704 --> 09:32.137
that an eight-year-old
would make.

09:34.508 --> 09:35.840
Jess.
Oh, Schmidt.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.576
What? Do you think this
neckline is too risque?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.411
No secret, your girls got bombs.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.413
She does, and normally, there's
nothing I'd rather talk about,

09:41.415 --> 09:43.181
but Kim is on a rampage

09:43.183 --> 09:45.383
and I forgot about this
<i> fakakta</i> report that's due.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.085
If she finds you here
helping with the wedding...

09:47.087 --> 09:48.153
KIM:
Schmidt!

09:49.056 --> 09:51.356
Ha, ho...

09:51.358 --> 09:53.124
You walk on cat feet, you do.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.125
Who is this?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.126
Who's who?

09:55.128 --> 09:57.195
This woman between us.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.863
There's no one else
I could be talking about.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.198
There's so many women
in this office.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.367
Who is this woman
between us

10:02.369 --> 10:04.102
sitting on the couch, Schmidt?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.136
I'm so lost.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.105
Her.
Now I see her.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.106
Hi.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.108
Hi.
Jess is...

10:10.110 --> 10:12.377
She's the new temp.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.545
I'm Jess, the new temp.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.779
Good, I need someone.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.750
Come with me.
Up, let's go.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.452
Looks like you make
your own jewelry.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.253
I'm gonna tell you right now,
I don't want to hear about it.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.622
(whispering):
She's mean.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.656
Temp! Come!

10:24.658 --> 10:25.857
(mouthing)

10:30.330 --> 10:31.329
Jess, this is
a disaster.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.964
We need to get you out of here

10:32.966 --> 10:35.900
before Kim actually puts my
balls in the jar on her desk

10:35.902 --> 10:37.802
labeled: "For Schmidt's Balls."

10:37.804 --> 10:39.571
We need an excuse
so airtight

10:39.573 --> 10:41.473
that she'll have
to let you leave.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.575
I got it.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.176
My mother is in grave danger.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.177
No, she's not.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.979
Pick up my kids.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.248
All right, hurry up,
you almost people!

10:50.250 --> 10:51.816
(children shouting)
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:51.818 --> 10:53.284
Little girl, come back!

10:53.286 --> 10:54.285
Come back!

10:54.287 --> 10:55.587
Sorry, I'm gonna need a minute.

10:55.589 --> 10:56.621
I'm gonna need a minute!

10:56.623 --> 10:57.656
(car horns honking)

10:57.658 --> 10:59.057
I don't even know these kids!

11:00.160 --> 11:01.493
Hey, Jess, so, you know,

11:01.495 --> 11:02.994
just-just give me
something to hold onto.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.095
Just tell me about the dress.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.497
(children screaming)

11:05.499 --> 11:06.665
Are you with kids right now?

11:06.667 --> 11:08.466
(children shouting)
No, no.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.634
(grunting)

11:09.636 --> 11:11.102
Did you just rip
that book in half?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.170
What are you, The Hulk?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.471
Um, yeah, you want to know

11:13.473 --> 11:14.506
something about the dress.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.507
Right, okay, um...

11:15.509 --> 11:17.008
It's white.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.177
I love it, I love it.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.812
Oh, my God,
I cannot wait for tonight.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.846
Tonight, yup.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.847
Okay.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.948
(chuckles)
Bye.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.617
Ah! Stop!

11:25.619 --> 11:29.654
Um... have you guys ever
seen where your mommy works?

11:29.656 --> 11:30.989
What do we do?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.490
There's no way
he didn't see us making out.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.491
Okay, first of all,

11:33.493 --> 11:34.859
you need to stop
freaking out, okay?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.161
You are panicking
right now,

11:36.163 --> 11:37.696
and you're
causing a scene.

11:37.698 --> 11:41.199
But, listen, Daniels is the
nicest guy in the world.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.667
I'm sure if we
explain to him

11:42.669 --> 11:44.703
our situation,
he'll be cool.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.704
All right. Let's go.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.771
Okay.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.375
Hey, buddy.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.843
Hey, guys.

11:51.845 --> 11:55.547
(groans) I'm so sorry
that I walked in on you before,

11:55.549 --> 11:59.050
but, uh, you know,
if I can be honest...

11:59.052 --> 12:00.351
I'm super excited.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.886
I think you guys
make a great couple.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.221
Really?
Yeah.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.556
Thank you.
Wow.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.058
Man, that, uh,
that means a lot.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.693
Okay, cool.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.495
So I take it this, you know,
stays between us?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.230
Oh, absolutely. Come on.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.231
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, yeah.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.666
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my gosh.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.569
Yeah, just give me $5,000,
and, uh, we're good.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.636
What?

12:20.407 --> 12:21.873
But you were so nice.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.875
Oh, I am, very nice, yeah.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.878
But I'm also a guy with a huge
gambling problem, you know?

12:26.880 --> 12:30.215
Mostly on the ponies,
but last night, I lost 60 large

12:30.217 --> 12:31.716
on a big game of "I Spy."

12:31.718 --> 12:32.751
(chuckles)

12:32.753 --> 12:34.919
Just didn't see that tree.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.454
What are you gonna do?

12:36.456 --> 12:37.589
(laughs)

12:37.591 --> 12:39.257
Yeah.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.594
You know this is blackmail...
and you're a police officer.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.929
Oh... I am a disaster.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.431
So here's the thing:
Should I...

12:46.433 --> 12:48.199
do we have a deal or
do I go to the sergeant?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.601
How do we want to...?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.269
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wow.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.570
You don't own us.

12:52.572 --> 12:53.938
You know what...

12:53.940 --> 12:55.774
everybody,
Bishop and I are...

12:55.776 --> 12:57.575
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.943
Are you sure about this?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.045
Yes.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.648
Yeah, I've never been
more sure of anything.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.620
Hey, everyone,
Bishop and I are dating.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.754
All right?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.389
That's right.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.725
We are rubbing butts
and we don't care who knows it.

13:13.727 --> 13:14.893
So...

13:14.895 --> 13:16.961
you two are hooking up.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.296
Yes, but...
Yeah...

13:18.298 --> 13:19.564
...first of all,
it's, like, so new...

13:19.566 --> 13:20.565
I get it.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.133
I get it.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.635
Winston is hot as hell.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.303
Some days, I'd like to

13:25.305 --> 13:27.972
drawer this badge
and hold him like a baby.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.307
(chokes)

13:29.309 --> 13:30.308
What?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.376
(deep growl)

13:32.779 --> 13:35.280
Anyway, you can't be partners
while you're dating.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.581
I'll, uh, split you

13:36.583 --> 13:39.150
and assign one of you
to our floater.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.286
WINSTON:
What? Daniels?!

13:41.288 --> 13:43.087
No, that guy tried
to blackmail us.

13:43.089 --> 13:44.656
That jelly bean?
(laughs)

13:44.658 --> 13:45.790
Nice try.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.158
(laughs)

13:47.160 --> 13:48.693
Bishop, uh,

13:48.695 --> 13:51.329
can I take a picture of you
eating a popsicle?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.430
What?

13:52.432 --> 13:53.464
No.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.166
Just do it.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.801
JESS:
Hey, hey, come back here!

13:56.803 --> 13:58.303
(girl squealing) Be careful,
that has pins in it.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.772
Jess, what the hell
are you doing in here?

14:00.774 --> 14:02.140
Well, I couldn't
stop working, but...

14:02.142 --> 14:03.508
Help me get this dress.
Uh, hey stop that!

14:03.510 --> 14:04.509
Little girl!
Come here.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.643
Come here.
Little girl.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.645
You get over here.
Jess, yank it off her.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.646
Stay still, come on.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.849
Yank it off her!
Wait, stop moving.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.417
(girl laughing)
Take this dress off, young lady.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.019
Hi, Mom.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.721
I'm fired, aren't I?

14:16.723 --> 14:17.789
(boy whoops, glass breaks)

14:22.696 --> 14:24.362
Oh, my God, I can't
believe we got fired.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.831
You never had a job here.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.466
I'm so sorry, Schmidt.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.001
It's not your fault.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.002
Entirely.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.537
I knew if I took my eye

14:32.539 --> 14:34.138
off the ball,
these estrogen zombies

14:34.140 --> 14:35.240
would suck out my soul,

14:35.242 --> 14:37.809
but, boy, did I love
working here.

14:37.811 --> 14:38.910
I loved every one of these

14:38.912 --> 14:42.580
malnourished,
high-strung sociopaths.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.816
Do you think you let the wedding
planning get on top of you?

14:44.818 --> 14:47.385
How am I supposed to marry the
most perfect woman in the world

14:47.387 --> 14:49.187
if I can't give her
the most perfect wedding?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.589
How am I supposed to give Cece

14:51.591 --> 14:53.725
a dress that's not
as perfect as she is?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.830
You can't fire Schmidt.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.164
You-- Give him his job back.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.566
That's not going to happen.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.668
Are you sure you want
to say that to the person

15:03.670 --> 15:04.869
who saw your schedule?

15:04.871 --> 15:07.906
Who would a married
woman be meeting

15:07.908 --> 15:09.841
at a hotel tonight?

15:09.843 --> 15:11.676
My father.
Oh!

15:11.678 --> 15:13.912
(laughs)
Well, that sounds nice.

15:13.914 --> 15:14.913
Who the hell are you?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.214
I'm Jess. I'm Schmidt's friend

15:16.216 --> 15:17.548
and I'm not a temp.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.716
I teach at Banyon Canyon.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.918
Banyon Canyon?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.586
I tried to get my kids in there,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.922
but there's been
some resistance.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.023
They're biters.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.859
Hard to get in Banyon Canyon.

15:27.861 --> 15:31.095
Don't know what it's worth
to have a friend on the inside.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.734
Cece! Will you help me?

15:36.736 --> 15:37.835
I hear you walking.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.539
(sighs)

15:41.541 --> 15:43.975
Oh, um, what am I
looking at here, man?

15:43.977 --> 15:45.944
This is rock bottom.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.546
I spent $200 on burner phones

15:48.548 --> 15:52.283
and Reagan still hasn't
responded to my original text.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.218
Why don't you just
text her as yourself?

15:54.220 --> 15:55.920
You don't think it's too late?

15:55.922 --> 15:57.288
Only one way to find out.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.423
All right.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.091
What do I have to
lose at this point?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.259
I don't have
any more money.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.761
Hey, Reagan,
it's Nick Miller.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.230
Uh, we lived in the
loft together just...

16:06.232 --> 16:07.765
we connected and we...

16:07.767 --> 16:08.967
Get to the point.

16:08.969 --> 16:09.968
Not gonna send any of that.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.469
Mm-hmm.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.137
Hey, Reagan.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.138
I'm gonna keep that.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.573
Reagan, it's Nick.

16:15.575 --> 16:20.011
Would you go to Cece and
Schmidt's wedding with me?

16:20.013 --> 16:22.447
I would love to see you.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.915
Send.
Great!

16:23.917 --> 16:25.249
Now you'll know,
one way or the other.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.417
(phone blips)

16:26.419 --> 16:28.019
She just wrote back.
She already wrote back.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.487
I-I-I can't swipe because

16:29.489 --> 16:30.989
my thumb is a little sweaty.
Will you swipe for me?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.256
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
okay, okay, okay.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.257
Just read it. Just read it.
Okay, okay, okay.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.626
"Um, hey, Nick, you idiot.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.162
I know it's you texting me
from these numbers."

16:38.164 --> 16:39.797
I can't disagree.
She gets me.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.499
Um, "I'd love to come
to the wedding..."

16:41.501 --> 16:42.633
Yes! Okay, good.

16:42.635 --> 16:43.634
Great!

16:43.636 --> 16:46.871
"...but I can't
because I have to work.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.039
I miss you."

16:48.041 --> 16:49.474
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.642
No, no, that... but, yeah.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.045
It mean, it means that she's
thinking about you, so that's...

16:54.047 --> 16:55.179
that's good.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.482
Most "derfinitely."

16:57.484 --> 16:58.683
I'm sorry.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.552
No, why sorry?
This is a success.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.687
"Derfinitely,
derfinitely, derfinitely."

17:02.689 --> 17:04.122
I'm sorry, Nick; I am.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.491
Turn "fiddy cent"
into a dollar.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.825
Are you about to cry now?

17:07.827 --> 17:08.893
Me? No.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.028
You-you look like
you're getting

17:10.030 --> 17:11.195
a little emotional;
are you good?

17:11.197 --> 17:12.363
I'm not at all, actually.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.364
Do you want some tissues or...

17:13.366 --> 17:14.999
No. Can I have my phone, please?

17:15.001 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.
Do you mind leaving?

17:16.002 --> 17:17.001
Not at all.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.037
Thanks for the good advice.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.272
(sighs, groans)

17:22.208 --> 17:24.976
(Nick grunts, groans)

17:24.978 --> 17:27.078
Here you go, sir.
A little lemon, a little honey.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.347
Be careful,
it's hot now, okay?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.515
So...

17:30.517 --> 17:31.883
which one of us takes

17:31.885 --> 17:32.917
the blackmailing
gambling addict?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.485
I'll take him.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.654
Can't be worse than
the job I had before this--

17:36.656 --> 17:38.790
photographing
those idiot babies.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.494
Uncross your eyes,
you idiot baby!

17:43.496 --> 17:45.096
(crying)

17:45.098 --> 17:46.831
Is that why you have all
those pictures of crying babies

17:46.833 --> 17:48.332
dressed as vegetables
in your living room?

17:48.334 --> 17:49.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that was weird.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.936
I tell you what--
uh, I'll partner with Daniels.

17:51.938 --> 17:52.937
You would do that for me?

17:52.939 --> 17:53.938
I'll take Daniels, yeah.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.939
Thank you.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.574
Of course, of course, but...

17:56.576 --> 17:58.209
it does come at a price.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.145
Ugh. I knew you were gonna...

(laughs)

18:32.579 --> 18:34.212
SCHMIDT:
<i> Can't believe I lost</i>

18:34.214 --> 18:35.213
my job.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.581
(grunts)

18:36.583 --> 18:37.849
Here they come.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.718
Banana cramps.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.253
Okay, bananas are supposed
to stop cramps.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.821
Mm-mm. Babe, how many of
those have you eaten?

18:44.491 --> 18:45.923
This many.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.058
Oh!
(sighs) Cece,

18:47.060 --> 18:48.059
what are we gonna do?

18:48.061 --> 18:49.560
It's gonna be okay, all right?

18:49.562 --> 18:52.230
You don't need to work
in that cat box, anyway.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.332
You deserve so much better.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.634
Thank you.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.769
Schmidt, I got your job back.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.004
Oh, thank Jesus.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.140
Let's just say some kids
from Banyon Canyon

19:02.142 --> 19:03.441
are gonna get bit.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.575
Now, it's not exactly

19:04.577 --> 19:05.643
your old job...

19:05.645 --> 19:07.111
It doesn't matter.
I'll take it.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.113
Jess... thank you.

19:09.115 --> 19:13.618
And, Cece, about your dress...

19:13.620 --> 19:15.086
I should have
told you before,

19:15.088 --> 19:16.087
but, um...

19:16.089 --> 19:17.622
But Jess...

19:17.624 --> 19:19.590
says that it's, uh...

19:19.592 --> 19:21.225
that it's gorgeous.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.761
Oh. (laughs)

19:23.763 --> 19:25.997
Oh! Great.

19:25.999 --> 19:29.467
Yeah, and it just needs
one final touch.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.135
Okay. Thank you.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.837
Thank you.
Oh, you had me worried.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.005
Whew! (laughs)

19:34.007 --> 19:35.973
Why did you
tell her that?

19:35.975 --> 19:37.542
Well, because, look,
I know how much

19:37.544 --> 19:39.377
this dress means
to her, and I...

19:39.379 --> 19:41.479
I do think that
together, we...

19:41.481 --> 19:43.781
Dear Lord, I can't even

19:43.783 --> 19:44.815
look at this thing anymore.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.150
I keep forgetting
how awful it is.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.718
Please, take it
off of the form.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.121
At some point,
we'll figure something out.

19:50.123 --> 19:51.355
I'd say let's burn it,

19:51.357 --> 19:52.690
but it looks
completely inflammable.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.463
Oh, my God.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.065
(gasps)

20:01.067 --> 20:05.703
Inside out... it's...

20:05.705 --> 20:07.038
Cece!
What's happening?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.039
What are you talking about?

20:08.041 --> 20:09.207
Get out!
It's bad luck to see it.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.741
It's bad luck to see it, move!

20:10.743 --> 20:11.909
Bad luck to see--
What are you talking about?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.311
Get out!
See what?

20:13.313 --> 20:14.712
What? What? Is it ready?
(shouts)

20:14.714 --> 20:15.813
Get-get out!

20:15.815 --> 20:17.448
Hold up!
No!

20:18.751 --> 20:19.850
(gasps)

20:19.852 --> 20:22.153
It's amazing!

20:22.155 --> 20:23.754
Yeah, if we just, you know,
take up the...

20:23.756 --> 20:24.822
We just have to bunch
it up a little bit

20:24.824 --> 20:25.823
right here.
Yeah.

20:25.825 --> 20:26.924
(gasps)

20:26.926 --> 20:29.293
It's perfect.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.169
Jess...

20:38.171 --> 20:40.171
Congratulations.

20:40.173 --> 20:41.372
It's a dress.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.207
We have a dress? We have
a dre... We have a dress!

20:43.209 --> 20:44.442
Everybody,
we have a dress!

20:44.444 --> 20:45.443
Man, what are you
yelling about?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.510
We have a dress.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.179
Cece's dress! Come see!

20:48.181 --> 20:49.347
Let's just go do it and
then it'll be over, right?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.215
Okay, let's do it, all right.
Wow!

20:51.217 --> 20:53.117
Not you.
Not me. Not...

20:53.119 --> 20:54.385
Not me. Okay.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.386
WINSTON:
Ooh! This is...

20:55.388 --> 20:57.722
Whatever you do,
don't let Nick touch it.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.724
I'm sure he's got lasagna
all under his fingernails.

20:59.726 --> 21:00.958
CECE (muffled):
How did you do this?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.093
(Jess speaking
indistinctly)

21:02.095 --> 21:04.128
Can someone at least
describe it to me?

21:04.130 --> 21:06.130
WINSTON:
In a word, "breathability."

21:06.132 --> 21:07.131
Real funny, man.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.633
(others conversing
indistinctly)

21:08.635 --> 21:10.234
WINSTON:
Who knew you were a seamstress?

21:10.236 --> 21:11.469
I guess, I guess I'll wait.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.904
CECE (muffled):
Oh, my God! Amazing!

21:13.906 --> 21:15.806
Let me in!
