WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.259
And why are we chasing it?

00:04.379 --> 00:08.009
It's mauve and dangerous, and about
30 seconds from the centre of London.

00:08.090 --> 00:10.310
Excuse me, there's this thing
that I need to find.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.054
Would've fallen from the sky.

00:12.137 --> 00:16.142
Nancy, the thing I'm looking for,
you know what I'm talking about, don't you?

00:18.810 --> 00:20.403
I've got you, you're fine.

00:20.479 --> 00:21.947
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.567
Jack Harkness, I've been hearing
all about you on the way over.

00:24.650 --> 00:29.451
It's 1941, the height of the London Blitz,
and something else has fallen on London.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.581
He said it was a warship,
he stole it.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.501
Parked it somewhere,
somewhere a bomb's going to fall on it,

00:34.618 --> 00:36.291
unless we make him an offer.

00:36.411 --> 00:40.666
It's a con. I was conning you.
That's what I am. I'm a con man.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.631
Mummy.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.009
There's something chasing you
and the other kids.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.973
Mummy. Mummy!

00:49.091 --> 00:50.809
You mustn't let him touch you.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.224
- What happens if he touches me?
- He makes you like him.

00:53.303 --> 00:57.433
Right, everybody out, across the back
garden, under the fence. Now, go, move!

00:58.475 --> 01:01.729
You'll find them everywhere,
in every bed in every ward.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.155
Hundreds of them.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.446
They've all got the same injuries,
scarring on the back of the hand,

01:06.525 --> 01:08.653
and the gas mask seems to be
fused to the flesh.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.826
- What was the cause of death?
- They're not dead.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.665
Are you my mummy?

01:13.782 --> 01:16.035
It's me Nancy!

01:16.159 --> 01:18.878
- Don't let them touch you.
- What happens if they touch us?

01:18.996 --> 01:20.714
You're looking at it.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.002
Mummy. Mummy...

01:27.004 --> 01:28.506
Go to your room.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.225
Go to your room.

01:39.558 --> 01:43.188
I mean it, I'm very, very angry with you.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.526
I'm very, very cross.

01:47.691 --> 01:51.161
Go to your room!

02:13.216 --> 02:15.389
I'm really glad that worked.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.683
Those would have been
terrible last words.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.771
Jamie.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.008
- Why are they all wearing gas masks?
- They're not.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.094
Those masks are flesh and bone.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.764
- How was your con supposed to work?
- Simple enough, really.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.763
Find some harmless piece of space junk,

03:36.842 --> 03:39.140
let the nearest Time Agent
track it back to Earth,

03:39.261 --> 03:41.355
convince him it's valuable
and name a price.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.599
When he's put 50% upfront... oops!

03:43.682 --> 03:46.561
German bomb falls on it,
destroys it forever.

03:46.643 --> 03:50.944
He never gets to see what he's paid for,
never knows he's been had.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.322
I buy him a drink with his own money
and we discuss dumb luck.

03:54.443 --> 03:57.822
- The perfect self-cleaning con.
- Yeah. Perfect.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.831
The London Blitz is great
for self-cleaners.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.664
Pompeii's nice if you want to make
a vacation of it, though.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.537
But you've got to set your alarm
for Volcano Day.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.636
- Getting a hint of disapproval.
- Take a look around the room.

04:12.711 --> 04:15.055
This is what your piece of
harmless space junk did.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.971
It was a burnt-out medical transporter,
it was empty.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.471
Rose.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.725
- Are we getting out of here?
- We're going upstairs.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.725
I programmed the flight computer
so it wouldn't land on anything living.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.899
I harmed no one!

04:27.184 --> 04:30.063
I don't know what's happening here
but I had nothing to do with it.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.385
I'll tell you what's happening.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.863
You forgot to set your alarm clock.
It's Volcano Day.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.737
- What's that?
- The all clear.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.368
I wish.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.767
I thought you were Jamie.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.936
- Dad! Dad!
- Ruddy kids!

05:07.057 --> 05:08.934
- Get off of me!
- Give us a hand.

05:09.059 --> 05:13.235
- Get your hands off me now!
- You! Get in!

05:13.355 --> 05:16.734
Get her in there.
She's nicked!

05:17.567 --> 05:19.410
- Mr Spock?
- Doctor.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.746
Have you got a blaster?

05:24.741 --> 05:26.243
Sure.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.089
The night your space junk landed,
someone was hurt.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.250
- This is where they were taken.
- What happened?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.719
Let's find out. Get it open.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.256
- What's up with your sonic screwdriver?
- Nothing.

05:42.634 --> 05:46.184
Sonic blaster, 51 st century.
Weapon factories of Villengard.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.783
- You've been to the factories?
- Once.

05:47.806 --> 05:51.356
They're gone now, destroyed. Main reactor
went critical, vaporised the lot.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.319
Like I said. Once.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.282
There's a banana grove there now.
I like bananas. Bananas are good.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.695
- Nice blast pattern.
- Digital.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.622
- Squareness gun? I like it.
- Yeah.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.677
- What do you think?
- Something got out of here.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.340
Yeah. And?

06:19.254 --> 06:22.349
Something powerful. Angry.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.802
Powerful and angry.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.990
A child?

06:46.489 --> 06:50.164
- I suppose this explains "mummy".
- How could a child do this?

06:51.328 --> 06:55.049
- Do you know where you are?
- Are you my mummy?

06:56.166 --> 06:59.010
Are you aware of
what's around you?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.846
Can you. see?

07:02.005 --> 07:03.882
Are you my mummy?

07:04.007 --> 07:07.978
- What do you want? Do you know...
- I want my mummy!

07:08.720 --> 07:11.223
Are you my mummy?
I want my mummy.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.192
Are you my mummy?

07:15.226 --> 07:17.445
Are you my mummy?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.319
Mummy? Mummy?

07:22.817 --> 07:25.366
- Doctor, I've heard this voice before.
- Me, too.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.659
Mummy?

07:26.738 --> 07:29.412
Always "are you my mummy?"
Like he doesn't know.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.829
Mummy.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.252
Why doesn't he know?

07:32.369 --> 07:35.373
Are you there, Mummy? Mummy?

07:40.585 --> 07:42.929
The police are on their way.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.641
I pay for
the food on this table.

07:46.716 --> 07:50.721
The sweat on my brow, that food is.
The sweat on my brow.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.642
Anything else you'd like?
I've got a whole house here.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.398
Anything else you'd like to
help yourself to?

07:58.269 --> 07:59.566
Yeah.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.781
I'd like some
wire cutters, please.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.242
Something that can cut through
barbed wire.

08:04.359 --> 08:08.034
Oh, and a torch.
Don't look like that, Mr Lloyd.

08:08.113 --> 08:12.368
I know you got plenty of tools in here.
I been watching this house for ages.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.579
And I'd like another look round
your kitchen cupboards.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.208
I was in a hurry the first time.
I want to see if there's anything I missed.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.416
The food on this table...

08:20.542 --> 08:23.091
It's an awful lot of food,
isn't it, Mr Lloyd?

08:23.211 --> 08:25.589
A lot more than on
anyone else's table.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.132
Half this street thinks

08:27.215 --> 08:30.435
your missus must be messing about
with Mr Haverstock, the butcher.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.761
But she's not, is she?

08:33.554 --> 08:37.934
You are.
Wire cutters. Torch. Food.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.400
And I'd like to use your bathroom
before I leave, please.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.904
Oh, look! There's
the sweat on your brow.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.459
Mummy? Please, Mummy. Mummy?

08:54.576 --> 08:55.793
Doctor?

08:55.952 --> 08:58.000
- Can you sense it?
- Sense what?

08:58.121 --> 09:01.125
Coming out of the walls.
Can you feel it?

09:01.833 --> 09:04.928
Funny little human brains.
How do you get around in those things?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.005
When he's stressed,
he likes to insult species.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.724
- Rose, I'm thinking!
- He cuts himself shaving.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.222
He does half an hour on life-forms
he's cleverer than.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.021
There are these children.
Living rough round the bomb sites.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.266
They come out during air raids,
looking for food.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.565
Mummy, please.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.645
Suppose they were there when this thing,
whatever it was, landed.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.523
- It was a med-ship, it was harmless.
- You keep saying. Harmless.

09:24.647 --> 09:27.992
- Suppose one was affected. Altered.
- Altered how?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.656
I'm here!

09:29.778 --> 09:33.157
It's afraid, terribly afraid and powerful.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.371
It doesn't know it yet.
But it will do.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.962
It's got the power of a god
and I just sent it to its room.

09:41.873 --> 09:42.999
Doctor.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.793
I'm here! Can '2' you see me?

09:44.876 --> 09:46.719
What's that noise?

09:48.171 --> 09:51.675
End of the tape.
It ran out about 30 seconds ago.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.346
I'm here now!
Can't you see me?

09:55.553 --> 09:59.183
I sent it to its room.
This is its room.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.650
Are you my mummy?

10:07.357 --> 10:08.654
Mummy?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.493
Doctor?

10:10.693 --> 10:15.324
Okay, on my signal
make for the door.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.283
Mummy?
'NOW!

10:17.367 --> 10:18.744
Mummy?

10:20.495 --> 10:23.169
- Go, now, don't drop the banana!
- Why not?

10:23.248 --> 10:25.376
Good source of potassium.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.217
Give me that.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.589
Mummy? I want my mummy.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.053
Digital rewind. Nice switch.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.390
It's from the groves of Villengard,
thought it was appropriate.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.563
There's really a banana grove in Villengard?
And you did that?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.227
Bananas are good.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.271
- Doctor!
- Come on!

10:53.361 --> 10:56.615
Mum my! Mu m my!

11:03.288 --> 11:05.336
It's keeping us here
till it can get at us.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.292
- It's controlling them?
- It is them.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.465
It's every living thing in this hospital.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.634
Okay. This can function
as a sonic blaster,

11:11.754 --> 11:14.928
a sonic cannon and
it's a triple-enfolded sonic disruptor.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.140
- Doc, what you got?
- I've got a sonic... Never mind.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.605
- What?
- It's sonic, okay? Let's leave it at that.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.356
Disruptor? Cannon? What?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.981
It's sonic, totally sonic.
I am soniced up.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.071
- A sonic what?
- Screwdriver!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.118
Going down.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.580
Doctor, are you okay?

11:40.658 --> 11:43.286
- Could've used a warning.
- The gratitude.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.505
- Who has a sonic screwdriver?
- I do.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.919
Lights?

11:46.998 --> 11:49.968
Who looks at a screwdriver and thinks,
"Ooh, this could be more sonic?"

11:50.126 --> 11:52.754
- You've never been bored?
- There's got to be a light switch.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.011
Never had a long night?
Never had a lot of cabinets to put up?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.009
- Mummy.
- Mummy.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.351
Door

12:03.598 --> 12:04.850
- Damn it!
- Mummy?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.477
It's the special features,
they really drain the battery.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.979
The battery?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.069
It's so lame.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.823
I was going to send for another one
but somebody's got to blow up the factory.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.946
I know. First day I met him,
he blew my job up.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.622
That's practically
how he communicates.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.370
Okay, that door
should hold it for a bit.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.370
- The door? The wall didn't stop it.
- It's got to find us first!

12:24.494 --> 12:26.713
Come on, we're not done yet.
Assets.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.003
I've got a banana and, in a pinch,
you could put up some shelves.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.635
- Window?
- Barred. Sheer drop. Seven storeys.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.962
And no other exits.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.515
The assets conversation went in a ﬂash,
didn't it?

12:38.341 --> 12:40.469
- Where'd you pick this one up, then?
- Doctor.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.805
She was hanging from a barrage balloon,
I had an invisible spaceship.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.731
I never stood a chance.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.600
Okay. One,
we've got to get out of here.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.358
Two, we can't get out of here.
Have I missed anything?

12:51.354 --> 12:54.358
Yeah. jack just disappeared.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.538
I thought as much.
What are all of you doing here?

13:07.662 --> 13:09.630
Different house
every night I told you.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.300
We thought you were dead.
Or you'd run off.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.753
I didn't. I knew
you'd come back for us.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.017
Found that old thing in the junk.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.687
- Thinks he's can write now.
- Writing a letter to me dad.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.606
You don't even know where your dad is.
How you gonna send it?

13:27.724 --> 13:30.898
- I don't know, stick it in an envelope.
- You can't even read or write.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.858
I don't need to,
I've got a machine.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.235
Will you stop
making that noise?

13:39.610 --> 13:41.078
I'm sorry, Jim.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.746
On you go, you write a letter
to your dad if you want to.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.458
I know we should
have went somewhere else

13:53.583 --> 13:55.927
but we need you, see,
for the thinking.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.421
What if I wasn't here?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.924
What if one night
I didn't come back for you?

14:01.049 --> 14:03.768
There's a war on,
people go out.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.138
They don't always come back.
It happens.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.765
What would you do then?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.991
They're wire cutters.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.109
I need you to think about that.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.330
- Someone's got to look after this lot.
- Why? Are you going somewhere?

14:26.449 --> 14:29.794
The bomb site.
The one at the railway station.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.122
- Why?
- The child.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.750
That's where he was killed.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.552
That's where it all started.
And I'm gonna find out how.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.881
- He'll get you.
- And then he'll come for us.

14:40.963 --> 14:45.093
- He always comes for us.
- No, Ernie, he doesn't.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.308
He always comes after me.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.976
There are things I haven't told you.
Things I can't tell you.

14:54.310 --> 14:58.656
As long as you're with me,
you're in danger.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.447
Even right now. Sitting here.
You're in danger because of me.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.745
You're the one
that keeps us safe.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.790
You think so, Ernie?
Then answer this.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.327
Jim is sitting
there right next to you.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.831
So who's typing?

15:34.684 --> 15:35.981
Is he coming?

15:36.060 --> 15:40.190
Ernie, as long as you're with me,
he's always coming.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.827
Plenty of greens.
And chew your food.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.381
Okay, so he's
vanished into thin air.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.251
Why is it always the great-looking ones
who do that?

16:00.376 --> 16:04.882
- I'm making an effort not to be insulted.
- I mean, men.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.512
Okay, thanks, that really helped.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.685
Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.851
Back on my ship.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.059
Used the emergency teleport.
Sorry I couldn't take you.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.903
It's security-keyed
to my molecular structure.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.688
I'm working on it,
hang in there.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.193
How are you speaking to us?

16:22.273 --> 16:24.617
Om-Com. I can call anything
with a speaker grill.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.907
- Now there's a coincidence.
- What is?

16:27.028 --> 16:29.747
- The child can Om-Com, too.
- He can?

16:29.906 --> 16:32.625
Anything with a speaker grill.
Even the Tardis phone.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.585
What, you mean
the child can phone us?

16:34.702 --> 16:39.253
And I can hear you.
Coming to find you.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.092
Coming to find you.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.133
- Doctor, can you hear that?
- Loud and clear.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.631
I'll try to block out the signal.
Least I can do.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.474
Coming to find you, Mummy.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.593
Remember this one, Rose?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.772
Our song.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.900
What you doing?

17:47.984 --> 17:51.784
Trying to set up a resonation pattern
in the concrete, loosen the bars.

17:51.862 --> 17:56.117
- Do you think he's coming back?
- Wouldn't bet my life.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.497
Why don't you trust him?

17:57.618 --> 17:59.962
- Why do you?
- Saved my life.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.665
Bloke-wise, that's up there with flossing.

18:06.210 --> 18:10.841
I trust him because he's like you.
Except with dating and dancing.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.395
- What?
- You just assume I'm...

18:16.512 --> 18:19.857
- What?
- You just assume I don't dance.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.644
What? Are you
telling me you do dance?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.946
900 years old, me.
I've been around a bit.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.319
I think you can assume at some point
I've danced.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.241
- You?
- Problem?

18:29.358 --> 18:32.328
Doesn't the universe implode
or something if you dance?

18:32.403 --> 18:35.156
Well, I've got the moves
but I wouldn't want to boast.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.016
You've got the moves?
Show me your moves.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.432
Rose, I'm trying to resonate concrete.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.396
Jack will be back. He'll get us out.
So come on.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.392
The world doesn't end
because the Doctor dances.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.408
- Barrage balloon?
- What?

19:15.029 --> 19:16.906
You were hanging
from a barrage balloon.

19:17.031 --> 19:20.285
Oh. Yeah.
About two minutes after you left me.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.162
Thousands of feet above London,
middle of a German air raid,

19:23.245 --> 19:24.918
Union jack all over my chest.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.541
I've travelled with a lot of people

19:26.624 --> 19:29.377
but you're setting new records
for jeopardy friendly.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.464
Is this you dancing?
Because I've got notes.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.432
Hanging from a rope,
thousands of feet above London.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.514
Not a cut, not a bruise.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.561
Yeah, I know.
Captain jack fixed me up.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.389
We're calling him Captain jack now,
are we?

19:41.472 --> 19:44.100
His name's jack
and he's a captain.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.570
- He's not really a captain, Rose.
- Do you know what I think?

19:48.312 --> 19:51.236
I think you're
experiencing captain-envy.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.861
You will find your feet
at the end of your legs.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.366
You may care to move them.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.413
If ever he was a captain,
he's been defrocked.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.834
- Yeah? Shame I missed that.
- Actually, I quit.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.624
Nobody takes my frock.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.548
Most people notice
when they've been teleported.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.591
You guys are so sweet.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.010
Sorry about the delay.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.176
Had to take the Nav-Com
off-line to override the teleport security.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.765
You can spend 10 minutes
overriding your own protocols.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.935
Maybe you should remember
whose ship it is.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.854
I do. She was gorgeous.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.850
Like I told her,
be back in five minutes.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.946
- This is a Chula ship.
- Yeah, just like that medical transporter.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.943
Only this one is dangerous.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.618
They're what fixed up my hands up.
Jack called them...

20:35.693 --> 20:37.661
- Nanobots? Nanogenes?
- Nanogenes, yeah.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.998
Subatomic robots.
There are millions of them in here. See?

20:41.157 --> 20:44.081
Burned my hand on the console
when we landed. All better now.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.037
They activate
when the bulkhead's sealed.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.665
Check you out for damage,
fix any physical ﬂaws.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.636
Take us to the crash site.
I need to see your space junk.

20:53.711 --> 20:57.682
Soon as I get the Nav-Com back online.
Make yourself comfortable.

20:57.798 --> 21:01.018
Carry on with whatever it was
you were doing.

21:01.135 --> 21:04.014
- We were talking about dancing.
- It didn't look like talking.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.061
Didn't feel like dancing.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.500
Halt! Don't move!

21:29.246 --> 21:32.841
So, you used to be a Time Agent
and now you're trying to con them?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.511
If it makes me sound any better,
it's not for the money.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.179
For what?

21:37.254 --> 21:39.973
Woke up one morning
when I was still working for them,

21:40.049 --> 21:42.393
found they'd stolen two years
of my memories.

21:42.510 --> 21:45.605
- I'd like them back.
- They stole your memories?

21:45.721 --> 21:48.440
Two years of my life.
No idea what I did.

21:49.266 --> 21:53.942
Your friend over there doesn't trust me.
And for all I know, he's right not to.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.944
Okay. We're good to go.
The crash site?

22:00.903 --> 22:04.373
- As you were. You feeling any better?
- Just a touch, sir.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.251
Chain her up where Jenkins
can keep an eye on her.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.712
No. Not in here. Not with him.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.832
You shouldn't have broken in here
if you didn't want to stay.

22:12.915 --> 22:15.213
You don't understand.
Not with him.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.636
This is
a restricted area, miss.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.630
You can just sit
here for a bit.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.133
We're going to have to ask you
a few questions.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.601
Found these, sir.

22:24.635 --> 22:28.265
Very professional,
a little bit too professional.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.483
Didn't just drop in by accident then,
did you?

22:30.599 --> 22:32.272
My little brother died here.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.521
I wanted to find out what killed him.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.106
Take the men, check the fence
for any other breaches.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.030
And search the area,
she may not have come here alone.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.782
- Yes, sir!
- Please.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.870
Listen, you can't leave me here.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.290
- Watch her, Jenkins.
- Yes, Mummy.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.119
'Jenkins?
- Sorry.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.088
Sir, I don't know
what's the matter with me.

22:53.247 --> 22:57.502
Look, lock me up, fine, but not here.
Please, anywhere but here.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.840
You'll be all right, miss.
I'm just a little...

23:03.757 --> 23:06.135
just a little...

23:06.260 --> 23:07.637
What's the matter with you?

23:07.761 --> 23:11.106
- Please, let me go.
- Why would I do that?

23:11.181 --> 23:13.400
Because you've got a scar
on the back of your hand.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.024
Yes, but I don't see
what that's got to do with anything.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.522
You feel like
you're gonna be sick.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.990
Like something's
forcing its way up your throat.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.698
I know because
I've seen it before.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.831
- What's happening to me?
- In a minute you won't be you anymore.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.957
You won't even remember you.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.503
And unless you let me go,
it's going to happen to me, too.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.793
- Please.
- What are you talking about?

23:34.872 --> 23:37.295
- What's your mother's name?
- Matilda.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.001
- You got a wife?
- Yes.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.594
Wife's name?

23:40.669 --> 23:43.969
You got kids?
What's your name?

23:45.341 --> 23:49.596
Please, let me go.
It's too late for you. I'm sorry.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.806
But please let me go.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.226
What...

23:55.684 --> 23:58.528
Mummy!

24:11.492 --> 24:12.869
There it is.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.584
They've got Algy on duty.
Must be important.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.423
We've got to get past him.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.885
Are the words "distract the guard"
heading in my general direction?

24:22.002 --> 24:24.130
I don't think that'd
be such a good idea.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.056
Don't worry, I can handle it.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.892
I've got to know Algy quite well
since I've been in town.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.353
Trust me, you're not his type.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.522
I'll distract him.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.226
Don't wait up.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.899
Relax.
He's a 51 st century guy.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.776
He's just a bit more flexible
when it comes to dancing.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.870
How flexible?

24:47.945 --> 24:50.744
By his time, you lot are spread
out across half the galaxy.

24:50.864 --> 24:54.209
- Meaning?
- So many species, so little time.

24:54.284 --> 24:56.457
What, that's what we do
when we get out there?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.548
That's our mission?
We seek new life and...

25:00.958 --> 25:02.255
Dance.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.762
Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?

25:13.262 --> 25:15.435
- Mummy?
- Algy, old sport, it's me.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.067
- Mummy?
- It's me, jack.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.485
Jack?

25:22.479 --> 25:24.732
Are you my mummy?

25:40.581 --> 25:43.460
Stay back! You men, stay away.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.096
The effect's becoming airborne,
accelerating.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.303
- What's keeping us safe?
- Nothing.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.055
- Here they come again.
- All we need.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.354
Didn't you say a bomb
was gonna land here?

26:00.476 --> 26:01.898
Never mind about that.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.275
If the contaminant's airborne now,
there's hours left.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.571
- Till what?
- Till nothing.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.741
Forever.
For the entire human race.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.443
And can anyone
else hear singing?

26:09.526 --> 26:11.073
♪ ...the tree tops

26:11.153 --> 26:14.657
♪ When the wind blows
the cradle will rock

26:15.657 --> 26:19.036
♪ When the bow breaks
the cradle will fall

26:19.620 --> 26:22.840
♪ Down will come
baby cradle and all

26:27.503 --> 26:31.178
♪ Rock-a-bye baby
on the tree tops

26:32.049 --> 26:35.178
♪ When the wind blows
the cradle will rock ♪

26:45.729 --> 26:47.857
You see? just an ambulance.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.783
That's an ambulance?

26:49.858 --> 26:53.704
It's hard to explain.
It's from another world.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.248
- They've been trying to get in.
- Of course they have.

26:56.365 --> 26:59.460
They think they've got their hands on
Hitler's latest secret weapon.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.209
- What are you doing?
- The sooner you see this thing's empty,

27:02.329 --> 27:04.548
the sooner you'll know
I had nothing to do with it.

27:07.668 --> 27:08.885
Didn't happen last time.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.721
It hadn't crashed last time.
There'll be emergency protocols.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.716
Doctor, what is that?

27:19.221 --> 27:20.393
Mummy.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.743
Doctor!

27:36.238 --> 27:38.081
- Captain, secure those gates.
- Why?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.621
Just do it!

27:40.742 --> 27:42.335
Nancy, how did you get in here?

27:42.411 --> 27:44.379
- I cut the wire.
- Show Rose.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.707
Setting 2,428-D.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.418
- What?
- Reattaches barbed wire. Go!

28:08.312 --> 28:10.781
Who are you?
Who are any of you?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.113
Never believe me if I told you.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.907
You just told me that was
an ambulance from another world.

28:15.986 --> 28:19.331
There are people running round
with gas masks calling for their mummies

28:19.448 --> 28:22.076
and the sky's full of Germans
dropping bombs on me.

28:22.159 --> 28:25.629
Tell me, do you think
there's anything left I couldn't believe?

28:27.247 --> 28:29.716
We're time travellers.
From the future.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.341
- Mad, you are!
- We have a time travel machine.

28:33.462 --> 28:37.592
It's not that. All right,
you got a time travel machine.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.594
I'll believe you.
Believe anything, me.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.269
But what future?

28:48.143 --> 28:50.771
Nancy, this isn't the end.

28:50.854 --> 28:54.028
I know how it looks,
it's not the end of the world or anything.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.948
How can you say that?
Look at it.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.951
Listen to me.
I was born in this city.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.749
I'm from here,
in like 50 years' time.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.122
- From here?
- I'm a Londoner.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.252
- From your future.
- But...

29:09.331 --> 29:11.754
- But you're not...
- What?

29:11.833 --> 29:14.086
- German?
- Nancy.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.173
The Germans don't come here.
They don't win.

29:17.965 --> 29:21.390
Don't tell anyone I told you so.
But you know what?

29:22.052 --> 29:24.646
- You win.
- We win?

29:26.682 --> 29:27.979
Come on.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.528
It's empty. Look at it.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.364
What do you expect
in a Chula medical. transporter?

29:34.481 --> 29:36.358
Bandages? Cough drops?

29:36.483 --> 29:38.702
- Rose?
- I don't know.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.450
- Yes, you do.
- Nanogenes!

29:41.530 --> 29:43.703
It wasn't empty, Captain.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.377
There was enough nanogenes in there
to rebuild a species.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.672
- Oh, God.
- Getting it now, are we?

29:50.747 --> 29:52.920
When the ship crashes,
the nanogenes escape.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.588
Billions upon billions of them.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.714
Ready to fix all the cuts and bruises
in the whole world.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.432
But what they find first is a dead child.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.723
Probably killed earlier that night.
And wearing a gas mask.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.518
And they brought him back to life?
They can do that?

30:06.596 --> 30:09.475
What's life? Life's easy.
A quirk of matter.

30:09.558 --> 30:13.028
Nature's way of keeping meat fresh.
Nothing to a nanogene.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.400
One problem, though.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.070
These nanogenes,
they're not like the ones on your ship.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.318
This lot have never seen
a human being before.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.995
Don't know what a human being's
supposed to look like.

30:22.070 --> 30:25.870
All they've got to go on is one little
body, and there's not a lot left.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.121
But they carry right on.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.711
They do what they're programmed to,
they patch it up.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.881
Can't tell what's gas mask and what's
skull, but they do their best.

30:32.956 --> 30:35.630
And then off they fly, off they go,
work to be done.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.880
'Cause you see, now they think
they know what people should look like.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.806
And it's time to fix all the rest.
And they won't ever stop.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.470
They won't ever stop.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.311
The entire human race
is gonna be torn down

30:46.428 --> 30:50.433
and rebuilt in the form of one terrified
child looking for its mother.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.561
- And nothing in the world can stop it!
- I didn't know.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.703
Mummy.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.003
Rose?

31:17.292 --> 31:20.466
Mummy. Mummy...

31:26.927 --> 31:28.975
It's bringing the gas mask people here,
isn't it?

31:29.096 --> 31:33.192
The ship thinks it's under attack. It's
calling up the troops. Standard protocol.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.356
But the gas mask people aren't troops!

31:35.477 --> 31:37.605
They are now.
This is a battlefield ambulance.

31:37.687 --> 31:41.157
The nanogenes don't just fix you up,
they get you ready for the frontline.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.570
- Equip you, program you.
- That's why the child's so strong?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.246
Why it could do that phoning thing?

31:46.321 --> 31:49.165
It's a fully equipped Chula warrior, yes.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.286
All that weapons tech in the hands
of an hysterical four-year-old

31:52.369 --> 31:55.839
looking for his mummy
and now there's an army of them.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.216
Mummy. Mummy.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.511
Why don't they attack?

32:01.628 --> 32:04.723
Good little soldiers.
Waiting for their commander.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.888
The child?

32:07.008 --> 32:08.510
- Jamie.
- What?

32:09.177 --> 32:11.225
Not the child. Jamie.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.229
- So how long until the bomb falls?
- Any second.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.728
What's the matter, Captain?
Bit close to the volcano for you?

32:17.853 --> 32:19.651
- He's just a little boy.
- I know.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.903
- He's just a boy who wants his mummy.
- I know.

32:24.568 --> 32:25.945
There isn't a little boy born

32:26.027 --> 32:28.997
who wouldn't tear the world apart
to save his mummy.

32:29.656 --> 32:33.160
- And this little boy can.
- So what are we gonna do?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.416
I don't know.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.587
- It's my fault.
- No.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.927
- It is. It's all my fault.
- How can it be your...

32:42.043 --> 32:45.172
Mummy. Mummy.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.558
- Mummy
- Mummy!

32:48.717 --> 32:50.264
Mummy!

32:57.017 --> 32:58.735
Nancy, what age are you?

33:00.562 --> 33:03.611
20? 21? Older than you look, yes?

33:06.109 --> 33:08.908
Doctor, that bomb, we've got seconds.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.616
- You can teleport us out.
- Not you guys.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.414
The Nav-Com's back online.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.662
Gonna take too long
to override the protocols.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.464
So it's Volcano Day.
Do what you've got to do.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.798
Jack?

33:26.087 --> 33:28.966
How old were you five years ago?
15? 16?

33:29.591 --> 33:31.935
Old enough to give birth, anyway.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.226
He's not your brother, is he?

33:37.974 --> 33:40.443
A teenage single mother in 1941.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.772
So you hid. You lied.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.782
You even lied to him.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.286
Are you my mummy?

33:54.908 --> 33:56.956
He's gonna keep asking, Nancy.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.455
- He's never gonna stop.
- Mummy.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.298
Tell him.

34:04.167 --> 34:08.764
Nancy, the future of the human race
is in your hands.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.966
Trust me and tell him.

34:13.842 --> 34:16.437
Are you my mummy?

34:18.806 --> 34:20.650
Are you my mummy?

34:22.268 --> 34:23.862
Are you my mummy?

34:23.978 --> 34:28.655
- Yes, I am your mummy.
- Mummy?

34:30.485 --> 34:34.159
- I'm here.
- Are you my mummy?

34:38.118 --> 34:39.620
I'm here.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.422
- Are you my mummy?
- Yes.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.873
Are you my mummy?

34:43.998 --> 34:46.717
He doesn't understand,
there's not enough of him left.

34:49.170 --> 34:54.016
I am your mummy.
I will always be your mummy.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.137
I'm so sorry.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.687
I'm so, so sorry.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.146
What's happening?

35:08.982 --> 35:10.905
- Doctor, it's changing her, we should...
- Shh!

35:12.152 --> 35:13.870
Come on. Please!

35:14.654 --> 35:18.204
Come on, you clever little nanogenes.
Figure it out.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.504
The mother, she's the mother.

35:22.579 --> 35:25.002
It's got to be enough information.
Figure it out.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.083
- what's happening?
- See?

35:28.084 --> 35:30.212
Recognising the same DNA.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.938
Come on.
Give me a day like this.

35:41.765 --> 35:43.517
Give me this one.

35:55.028 --> 35:59.033
Welcome back! 20 years to pop
music, you're gonna love it.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.579
What happened?

36:00.700 --> 36:04.170
The nanogenes recognised
the superior information. The parent DNA.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.919
They didn't change you
because you changed them.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.714
- Mother knows best.
- Amie.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.009
- Doctor, that bomb.
- Taken care of it.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.762
- How?
- Psychology.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.155
- Doctor!
- Good lad.

36:30.397 --> 36:35.403
The bomb's already started detonation.
I've put it in stasis, but it won't last!

36:35.485 --> 36:37.328
Change of plan!
Don't need the bomb.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.197
Can you get rid of it,
safely as you can?

36:39.280 --> 36:41.408
- Rose?
- Yea h?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.001
Goodbye.

36:46.788 --> 36:49.587
By the way. Love the T-shirt!

37:10.979 --> 37:13.653
- What are you doing?
- Software patch.

37:13.857 --> 37:17.487
Gonna email the upgrade.
You want moves, Rose.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.696
I'll give you moves.

37:30.290 --> 37:34.011
Everybody lives, Rose.
Just this once!

37:34.711 --> 37:36.509
Everybody lives!

37:42.635 --> 37:45.639
Dr Constantine,
who never left his patients.

37:45.722 --> 37:47.520
Back on your feet,
constant doctor.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.734
World doesn't want to get by
without you just yet

37:49.851 --> 37:51.853
and I don't blame it one bit.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.864
These are your patients.
All better now.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.150
Yes, so it seems.

37:57.901 --> 38:00.996
They also seem to be standing around
in a disused railway station.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.868
Is there any particular reason for that?

38:02.989 --> 38:04.491
Yeah, well, you know, cutbacks.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.542
Listen, whatever was wrong
with them in the past

38:06.701 --> 38:08.669
you're probably gonna find
that they're cured.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.465
Just tell them what a great doctor you are,

38:10.497 --> 38:12.591
don't make a big thing of it.
Okay?

38:14.709 --> 38:16.586
Dr Constantine.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.843
Mrs Harcourt!
How much better you're looking!

38:19.923 --> 38:21.846
My leg's grown back.

38:22.383 --> 38:26.354
When I come to the hospital,
I had one leg.

38:26.429 --> 38:30.229
Well, there is a war on,
is it possible you miscounted?

38:30.558 --> 38:34.153
Right, you lot. Lots to do.
Beat the Germans, save the world.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.357
Don't forget the welfare state!

38:38.233 --> 38:41.157
Setting this to self-destruct,
soon as everybody's clear.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.863
History says there
was an explosion here.

38:42.946 --> 38:46.200
- Who am Ito argue with history?
- Usually, the first in line.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.871
The nanogenes will clean up the mess

38:50.954 --> 38:53.332
and switch themselves off,
'cause I just told them to.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.384
Nancy and Jamie will go to
Dr Constantine for help, ditto.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.212
All in all, all things considered.
Fantastic!

38:59.295 --> 39:01.514
Look at you beaming away
like you're Father Christmas.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.808
Who says I'm not?
Red bicycle when you were 12.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.894
- What?
- And everybody lives, Rose.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.689
Everybody lives.
I need more days like this!

39:09.764 --> 39:12.813
- Doctor.
- Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.444
What about jack?

39:15.770 --> 39:17.568
Why did he say goodbye?

39:26.322 --> 39:29.747
Okay, computer,
how long can we keep the bomb in stasis?

39:29.826 --> 39:32.454
Stasis decaying at' 90% cycle.

39:32.579 --> 39:36.254
- Detonation in three minutes.
- Can we jettison it?

39:36.332 --> 39:40.087
Any attempt to jettison the device
will precipitate detonation.

39:40.169 --> 39:44.515
- 700% probability.
- We could stick it in an escape pod?

39:44.632 --> 39:46.726
There is no escape pod on board.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.350
Okay, see the ﬂaw in that.
I'll get in the escape pod.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.848
There is no escape pod on board.

39:51.973 --> 39:54.442
- Did you check everywhere?
- Affirmative.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.861
- Under the sink?
- Affirmative.

40:00.273 --> 40:01.490
Okay.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.574
Out of 100,
exactly how dead am I?

40:04.652 --> 40:08.282
Termination of Captain jack Harkness
in under two minutes.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.833
100% probability.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.705
Lovely. Thanks.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.382
- Good to know the numbers.
- You 're welcome.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.344
Okay, then!

40:21.461 --> 40:25.307
Think we'd better initiate
emergency protocol 417.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.883
Affirmative.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.688
A little too much vermouth.
See if I come here again.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.526
Funny thing.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.738
Last time I was sentenced to death

40:47.862 --> 40:51.036
I ordered four hyper-vodkas
for my breakfast.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.915
All a bit of a blur after that.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.877
Woke up in bed
with both my executioners.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.380
Lovely couple.
They stayed in touch.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.720
Can't say that
about most executioners.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.259
Anyway-

41:11.177 --> 41:13.680
Thanks for everything, computer.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.015
It's been great.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.251
Well! Hurry up, then!

41:47.422 --> 41:51.552
Okay, all right and turn.

41:54.554 --> 41:58.479
Okay, try and spin me again.
But this time, don't get my arm up my back.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.442
No extra points for a half-nelson.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.153
I'm sure I used
to know this stuff.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.817
Close the door, will you?

42:03.938 --> 42:06.657
Your ship's about to blow up,
there's gonna be a draft.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.120
Welcome to the Tardis.

42:11.779 --> 42:14.498
- Much bigger on the inside.
- You'd better be.

42:14.615 --> 42:18.165
I think what the Doctor is trying
to say is, you may cut in.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.964
- Rose! I've just remembered!
- What?

42:24.125 --> 42:26.469
I can dance!

42:28.337 --> 42:32.342
Actually, Doctor,
I thought jack might like this dance.

42:32.967 --> 42:36.141
I'm sure he would, Rose,
I'm absolutely certain.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.431
But who with?

43:09.796 --> 43:10.843
Whoo!

43:15.885 --> 43:18.513
And I was having
such a nice day.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.185
According to Intelligence,

43:20.306 --> 43:23.185
the target is the last surviving member
of the Slitheen family.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.858
A criminal sect from the planet
Rexicoricophalvitorius

43:26.020 --> 43:28.819
masquerading as a human being,
zipped inside a skin suit.

43:31.234 --> 43:34.534
Its nuclear power station right in
the heart of Cardiff city

43:34.654 --> 43:36.622
will bring jobs for all.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.041
And it just so happens to be
right on top of the rift.

43:39.200 --> 43:43.046
If this power station went into meltdown,
the entire planet would go...

43:45.373 --> 43:47.171
Go on then, run!

43:47.250 --> 43:49.548
It's the rift,
the rift's opening.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.550
The whole city's going to disappear!

43:51.671 --> 43:53.173
Time and space
are ripping apart.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.554
Never mind Cardiff,
it's going to rip open the planet!
