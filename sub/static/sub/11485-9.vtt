WEBVTT

00:04.788 --> 00:06.085
- Charlie.
- Come on.

00:06.156 --> 00:07.817
That tickles!

00:07.891 --> 00:10.485
- Uncle Charlie?
- Not now, Jake.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.188
I just heard the Fudge Nuggets song
you wrote on TV.

00:13.296 --> 00:14.354
Great.

00:17.367 --> 00:18.629
Great.

00:21.237 --> 00:23.728
- Jake, I'm not alone in here.
- No way.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.205
Way.

00:26.309 --> 00:28.402
- Who's in there?
- A friend of mine.

00:28.511 --> 00:30.536
- Is it a girl?
- Hold on.

00:32.649 --> 00:34.014
Oh, yeah.

00:35.318 --> 00:36.876
Is it Janet?

00:39.222 --> 00:40.484
No.

00:41.825 --> 00:45.261
It's my friend Wendy.
Say hi to Jake, Wendy.

00:47.397 --> 00:50.161
Hi, Jake. You sing really well.

00:50.233 --> 00:53.066
I have to go. This is embarrassing.

00:55.205 --> 00:58.368
- I like that you didn't lie to him.
- I try to be honest.

00:58.441 --> 01:01.239
It's a good quality. So, who's Janet?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:12.522 --> 01:14.683
You want a cup of coffee before you go?

01:14.758 --> 01:18.387
No, you've got work to do.
I should probably get going.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.895
Charlie, there's French toast left.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.056
No, thanks. You met Wendy, right?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.827
Sure. French toast, Wendy?

01:24.901 --> 01:27.893
No, thank you. I should really get going.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.438
You know, I can sing
all of Uncle Charlie's jingles.

01:30.540 --> 01:32.906
No kidding?
You're gonna have to show me sometime.

01:40.383 --> 01:42.613
- That's wonderful.
- Wendy's gotta go, Jake.

01:46.222 --> 01:48.087
Jake! Take five, buddy.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.523
Copasetic. That means okay.

01:51.394 --> 01:54.090
When he moved in here,
he was saying "swell. "

01:54.197 --> 01:57.098
Charlie, I've gotta go to my office
for a couple of hours.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.361
- Are you okay to watch Jake?
- No problem.

01:59.435 --> 02:00.629
Swell.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.734
Will you take me Rollerblading,
Uncle Charlie?

02:04.808 --> 02:08.209
- I can't, buddy. I got work to do.
- What am I gonna do all day?

02:08.277 --> 02:11.645
It's really nice outside.
Why don't you wash my car?

02:11.748 --> 02:13.579
No, I wanna go Rollerblading.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.448
I could take him.
I've got my blades right in the car.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.953
- Really?
- Lf it's okay with your father.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.081
- That sounds swell.
- I'll go get my blades.

02:22.325 --> 02:26.421
And if you want, I can go pick up lunch
and bring it back and we can have a picnic.

02:26.496 --> 02:28.589
Yeah. Swell.

02:31.801 --> 02:34.269
Nice girl. Is it serious?

02:34.571 --> 02:36.630
It is now, you dumb-ass.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.412
Finish your jingle?

02:46.482 --> 02:48.450
How can I work?

02:48.518 --> 02:52.477
First, Wendy took Jake Rollerblading.
Then she took him to the movies.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.491
Now she's in the kitchen,
making us all dinner.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.618
That bitch.

03:01.464 --> 03:02.863
Don't you get it?

03:02.966 --> 03:07.164
She's using your kid
to turn a nice, casual relationship

03:07.270 --> 03:09.704
into a relationship.

03:11.007 --> 03:13.475
Okay, now I get
where you're coming from.

03:13.543 --> 03:16.137
- Thank you.
- You're paranoid and you're nuts.

03:16.246 --> 03:18.271
Perfect timing. Dinner's ready.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.640
Did you see that?

03:22.919 --> 03:24.910
She's wearing an apron.

03:25.355 --> 03:26.947
In my house!

03:27.857 --> 03:30.155
Do you know what that means?

03:30.260 --> 03:33.252
I'm gonna stick with paranoid
and nuts, Bob.

03:34.697 --> 03:37.928
Are you sure that you don't want me
to stay and do the dishes?

03:38.001 --> 03:41.300
Positive. Alan would just re-wash
them anyways.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.367
- I guess I should probably get going.
- Yeah, I guess.

03:50.446 --> 03:53.279
Good, you're still here.
Jake wants to say good night.

03:53.349 --> 03:56.807
Wow, he's such a sweetie.
Don't you just want to eat him up?

03:57.820 --> 03:59.720
If that would stop him, yes.

04:00.523 --> 04:03.321
I gotta tell you, Charlie.
I think that girl's a keeper.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.384
- You think so?
- Yeah, she's smart,

04:05.461 --> 04:07.656
she's pretty,
and I think she really likes you.

04:07.730 --> 04:09.823
Be honest, Alan.
You married the first girl

04:09.899 --> 04:12.333
who slipped you the tongue, didn't you?

04:13.136 --> 04:15.400
- No.
- Trust me,

04:16.005 --> 04:17.733
this woman has a plan.

04:17.839 --> 04:21.003
And it's diabolical
in its Machiavellian scope.

04:21.844 --> 04:25.143
I did not marry the first girl
who slipped me the tongue.

04:26.082 --> 04:29.643
I'm telling you, she's got her foot
in the door and she will never leave.

04:29.719 --> 04:31.687
Okay, I'm out of here.

04:32.255 --> 04:33.745
Diabolical!

04:35.425 --> 04:39.657
- Okay. So, I'll give you a call?
- Yeah. That'd be great. Okay.

04:49.839 --> 04:51.773
It's pretty dark out.

04:52.241 --> 04:54.505
Maybe you should go in the morning.

04:54.577 --> 04:56.568
Yeah, I guess I could.

04:58.414 --> 05:00.075
Are you seeing this?

05:09.192 --> 05:10.853
Howdy, neighbor.

05:12.261 --> 05:14.126
Charlie's busy right now, Rose.

05:14.230 --> 05:18.360
I know. White Toyota hasn't
budged an inch two nights in a row.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.431
I chalked her tires.

05:23.773 --> 05:26.537
You do know there's a stairway
right over there?

05:26.609 --> 05:28.270
Of course.

05:28.378 --> 05:31.370
Did you know
there's a crawl space under the house

05:31.447 --> 05:33.813
that comes right up into your bedroom?

05:36.719 --> 05:40.052
- So, what are you doing?
- I'm playing computer Scrabble.

05:40.123 --> 05:42.819
All by yourself? That's so sad.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.452
I used to play with my wife every night,
and I guess I miss it.

05:46.562 --> 05:49.053
You and I have a lot in common, don't we?

05:50.133 --> 05:51.566
How so?

05:52.668 --> 05:57.503
We're both like two lonely socks that want
desperately to keep someone's feet warm.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.905
But we don't match up
with any other socks.

05:59.976 --> 06:03.139
So all we can hope for
is to be a dust mitten,

06:03.246 --> 06:04.941
or a hand puppet.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.251
That's very insightful.

06:13.823 --> 06:15.450
And disturbing.

06:17.994 --> 06:21.623
You're not thinking you and me, are you?

06:21.697 --> 06:25.133
That's very flattering, but...

06:53.963 --> 06:55.157
Wendy?

07:06.075 --> 07:08.908
"Dear Charlie,
thanks for a wonderful night.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.980
"Sweet. Special. See you soon. "

07:18.955 --> 07:20.820
<i>Freedom!</i>

07:22.225 --> 07:25.160
<i>I'm free, I'm so free</i>

07:34.370 --> 07:38.704
All right, you had sex last night.
You don't have to turn into Mr. Bojangles.

07:39.242 --> 07:42.575
It's better than that.
I had sex and I woke up alone.

07:42.678 --> 07:46.739
If there were pancakes on my night table,
it would be the perfect morning.

07:46.849 --> 07:50.683
What happened to Wendy's diabolical,
Machiavellian scheme to never leave?

07:50.753 --> 07:53.381
I don't know.
I must have foiled it somehow.

07:53.923 --> 07:56.084
Guess what? Grandma's here!

07:58.995 --> 08:01.156
Let's see that little dance again.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.564
When I was pregnant with Charlie,
we thought he was gonna be a girl.

08:05.668 --> 08:08.694
The sonogram showed
no discernible penis whatsoever.

08:15.344 --> 08:16.834
Now do you believe me?

08:16.913 --> 08:19.939
First she sucks in Jake, then you,
now Mom.

08:20.049 --> 08:22.745
She's like one of those pods
from outer space.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.383
But, you know, with a cute ass.

08:25.454 --> 08:29.220
She wouldn't even be here now
if you hadn't taken her upstairs last night.

08:29.292 --> 08:32.125
That was not my fault.
You saw how she kissed me.

08:32.227 --> 08:33.889
I had to take her upstairs.

08:33.962 --> 08:38.229
And remember what I said.
Hook him on the milk, he'll buy the cow.

08:39.235 --> 08:41.897
Charlie, where have you been
hiding this girl?

08:41.971 --> 08:43.938
She's an absolute delight!

08:44.307 --> 08:45.899
Yeah, she's swell.

08:45.975 --> 08:48.068
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Good morning.

08:48.144 --> 08:49.702
I read somewhere you had left.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.748
I was on my way out the door,
and then I ran into your mom,

08:52.815 --> 08:54.783
and then we started talking,
and, you know.

08:54.884 --> 08:56.374
Yeah, I know.

08:57.653 --> 08:59.314
So what brings you here, Mom?

08:59.422 --> 09:01.583
- Do I need a reason?
- I'd like one.

09:03.659 --> 09:06.560
I'm showing a house in Malibu.
I thought I'd swing by

09:06.629 --> 09:08.756
and take my grandson out for pancakes.

09:08.831 --> 09:11.163
Charlie wants his on his night table.

09:12.268 --> 09:13.758
I'm ready. You coming, Dad?

09:13.836 --> 09:17.135
Are you kidding?
I want to hear more about that sonogram.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.970
Good. Are you and Wendy
joining us, Charlie?

09:20.076 --> 09:23.375
Gee, Mom, I think Wendy has stuff to do.
Right, Wendy?

09:24.447 --> 09:26.244
I can always make time for pancakes.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.306
Wonderful. A family breakfast.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.044
Go put on some pants, Charlie.

09:30.119 --> 09:31.950
- But, Mom, I...
- Now.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.647
You have to be firm with him.

09:35.758 --> 09:38.955
By the way, your nose is adorable.

09:39.061 --> 09:41.086
- Thank you.
- I'm guessing Dr. Shapiro?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.721
No, it's mine.

09:44.767 --> 09:46.928
Sometimes God does good work, too.

09:49.272 --> 09:52.605
Jake, get your stuff together,
we gotta get you back to your mom's.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.575
Already? But we're playing.

09:54.644 --> 09:56.839
Yeah, I gotta get going, too, Jake.

09:58.281 --> 10:00.647
Okay. I pulled your car around.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.421
If you leave now,
I think you'll miss all the weekend traffic.

10:07.490 --> 10:09.458
Don't you worry, Charlie, I'm leaving.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.494
I'm not worried.
I just moved your car so Alan can get out.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.119
I can get out.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.757
Yes, Alan. Now you can.

10:19.635 --> 10:21.660
Thank you for a great weekend.

10:21.771 --> 10:23.295
No, thank you.

10:24.106 --> 10:26.199
- Jake, bye.
- Bye.

10:26.309 --> 10:28.470
- Alan, I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

10:30.112 --> 10:32.979
I gotta tell you, Charlie,
I think she's really...

10:39.822 --> 10:42.313
Okay. What?

10:43.326 --> 10:45.760
I'm just saying, I think she's really great.

10:45.828 --> 10:47.921
Me, too. When's she coming back?

10:47.997 --> 10:51.524
Let's see. Today's Sunday, so... Never.

10:52.668 --> 10:53.794
Why not?

10:53.869 --> 10:56.599
Buddy, she wants something different
in a relationship

10:56.672 --> 10:57.969
than your uncle Charlie does.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.338
- What does she want?
- Uncle Charlie.

11:02.678 --> 11:05.169
- What do you want?
- Uncle Charlie.

11:06.716 --> 11:08.513
And we both can't have me.

11:09.352 --> 11:11.650
- I don't understand.
- It's very simple, buddy.

11:11.721 --> 11:13.814
Uncle Charlie is nuts.

11:15.358 --> 11:17.383
Yeah, nuts like a fox.

11:19.128 --> 11:22.154
So then Wendy can't take me
Rollerblading anymore?

11:22.231 --> 11:24.165
- Nope.
- No more movies?

11:24.233 --> 11:25.723
Afraid not.

11:26.469 --> 11:28.130
Boy, you suck.

11:30.639 --> 11:34.006
Suck? How do I suck?

11:34.210 --> 11:35.677
Like a fox.

11:42.885 --> 11:45.911
There he is! Let the party begin!

11:46.021 --> 11:49.479
Shaking Jake! Notorious J-A-K-E!

11:50.159 --> 11:52.855
Jake, he won't stop until you say hello.

11:52.928 --> 11:54.361
Jakety-Jake-Jake!

11:56.031 --> 11:57.157
Hello.

11:57.233 --> 11:59.861
How was school this week?
We missed you around here.

11:59.935 --> 12:03.666
- It was just school.
- Yeah, I heard that. "Just school. "

12:04.440 --> 12:05.907
Right on.

12:09.712 --> 12:12.579
I don't believe it.
He's still mad about the Wendy thing.

12:12.681 --> 12:14.171
Charlie, it's only been a week.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.708
I'm still mad that you peed
in my Boy Scout canteen in 1978.

12:18.387 --> 12:20.787
Not much of a jamboree for you, was it?

12:23.793 --> 12:26.284
Okay, I'm sorry about the canteen.

12:27.263 --> 12:29.754
Now will you please make your son
like me again?

12:29.865 --> 12:33.426
How would I do that, Charlie?
And by the way, was that so hard?

12:35.471 --> 12:38.065
Explain to him that Wendy
was working an angle,

12:38.140 --> 12:40.074
making friends with him to get to me.

12:40.142 --> 12:42.474
Do you really want me
to tell a 10-year-old boy

12:42.578 --> 12:45.411
that somebody he cares about
was pretending to like him?

12:45.481 --> 12:46.812
What kind of lesson is that?

12:46.916 --> 12:49.476
He lives in LA. He might as well learn now.

12:49.585 --> 12:52.145
Just give him some time. He'll get over it.

12:57.393 --> 12:59.452
- Can I come in?
- It's your house.

12:59.562 --> 13:02.395
- Well, it's your house, too.
- Then, no.

13:03.098 --> 13:04.326
Okay.

13:07.837 --> 13:09.896
You know what? It is my house.

13:12.641 --> 13:16.475
Look, I'm sorry about the Wendy thing,
but there's nothing I can do about it.

13:16.579 --> 13:20.071
And I want us to be buddies again.
I don't want you to hate me anymore.

13:20.149 --> 13:22.344
- I don't hate you.
- Good.

13:22.451 --> 13:24.646
I'm just very disappointed in you.

13:26.121 --> 13:29.056
I get enough of that crap from my mother.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.957
So what's it gonna take?
Cash? Video games?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.826
I don't want stuff.

13:35.931 --> 13:38.764
I got plenty of stuff
when my mom and dad broke up.

13:38.834 --> 13:40.802
Dude, this isn't the same thing.

13:40.903 --> 13:44.430
What's the difference?
You liked Wendy, then you didn't like her,

13:44.507 --> 13:46.600
and no one cares what I want.

13:47.443 --> 13:50.173
Jake, buddy. Come here.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.908
Come here.

13:54.450 --> 13:55.747
Sit down.

13:58.020 --> 14:01.080
It's not that I don't care what you want.

14:01.790 --> 14:05.988
It's just that you're a kid.
And what you want doesn't matter.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.331
Wow, I do suck.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.207
H- A-T.

14:19.842 --> 14:21.036
Hat.

14:22.545 --> 14:25.343
That's it? All this time for "hat"?

14:26.148 --> 14:28.173
Let me see your tiles.

14:28.984 --> 14:31.350
See. You had "hateful. "

14:31.453 --> 14:35.150
See, it would have fit right here,
off the "A" in my "quotidian. "

14:36.292 --> 14:38.658
Wow, how did you see that?

14:38.727 --> 14:40.957
I have Scrabble eyes. It's a gift.

14:41.897 --> 14:43.865
And sometimes a curse.

14:45.668 --> 14:48.034
Alan, Jake won't play with me.

14:49.405 --> 14:53.705
Well, I can't play with you either, Charlie.
I am "occupied. "

14:53.809 --> 14:56.642
You played "pie" at your own peril,
my friend.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.973
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Rose.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.909
Alan, come here.

15:04.219 --> 15:05.584
Your move.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.816
What?

15:11.827 --> 15:15.194
- What are you doing with Rose?
- I'm teaching her to play Scrabble.

15:15.297 --> 15:19.131
- Alan, you are so naive!
- "Naive," eight points.

15:20.235 --> 15:21.395
What?

15:21.837 --> 15:24.169
Sorry. I'm in my game head.

15:24.373 --> 15:27.536
Alan, Rose is using you to get to me.

15:28.410 --> 15:30.503
Do you hear the rampant egotism,

15:30.579 --> 15:32.274
"rampant," 11 points, "egotism," 10,

15:32.348 --> 15:34.213
coming out of your mouth?

15:34.316 --> 15:37.308
- I'm just saying...
- Not everybody is trying to get to you.

15:37.386 --> 15:39.251
The only thing that's going on here

15:39.355 --> 15:42.153
is two lonely people
playing a game of Scrabble.

15:43.993 --> 15:47.224
Please tell me you're not thinking
about you and Rose?

15:47.329 --> 15:48.921
Me and Rose?

15:58.407 --> 15:59.738
Let's see.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.401
One Russian blonde.

16:05.247 --> 16:07.272
One Scottish brunette.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.911
And a full-bodied redhead
from Napa Valley.

16:15.124 --> 16:16.785
Charlie's angels.

16:21.263 --> 16:24.426
- Sorry. Oh, hi.
- Hi.

16:25.634 --> 16:28.967
- What are you doing here?
- I'm grocery shopping.

16:29.438 --> 16:31.872
Here? In my supermarket?

16:33.442 --> 16:35.433
So this is just a coincidence?

16:35.544 --> 16:39.640
Well, it's not entirely.
I eat food, and I live two blocks away.

16:39.815 --> 16:42.545
Come on, Wendy. We both know that...

16:44.420 --> 16:46.581
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

16:46.655 --> 16:49.317
Dave, this is Charlie. Charlie, Dave.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.496
Dave, we need a Duraflame log.

16:59.401 --> 17:00.561
Okay.

17:03.439 --> 17:07.204
- Who's that? Your brother?
- No, he's...

17:08.410 --> 17:11.810
Look, Charlie, I know
I probably should've given you a call,

17:11.914 --> 17:14.906
but I thought that after last weekend,
it was pretty clear,

17:14.983 --> 17:17.041
it wasn't gonna work out
between you and me.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.279
What?

17:18.387 --> 17:21.253
I was happy to entertain
your nephew for a while.

17:21.323 --> 17:23.916
I mean, he's a great kid,
but who's got the energy?

17:23.992 --> 17:26.256
And your mother,
she's been calling me all week.

17:26.328 --> 17:30.128
She wants to go to a spinning class
with me. What is up with that?

17:31.433 --> 17:34.163
I thought you two hit it off.

17:34.269 --> 17:37.136
I'm from the Midwest. I was being polite.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.433
What did you think was going on?

17:41.944 --> 17:43.241
That.

17:44.346 --> 17:47.679
- So, no hard feelings?
- No, of course not.

17:47.783 --> 17:51.150
So you and Dave, how serious is that?

17:52.287 --> 17:53.982
Goodbye, Charlie.

17:57.126 --> 17:59.856
You know,
you're breaking a little boy's heart.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.998
You see, my relationships with women,
they come and go.

18:06.101 --> 18:07.830
But you and me, we're family.

18:07.936 --> 18:10.666
That's solid. That's forever. You with me?

18:10.806 --> 18:12.000
I think so.

18:12.107 --> 18:15.543
Maybe I shouldn't be laying this on you,
because you're 10.

18:15.978 --> 18:17.809
But I'm beginning to realize

18:17.880 --> 18:21.179
I might not be the guy I thought
everybody thought I was.

18:23.051 --> 18:25.713
Yeah, it's a mind blower, isn't it?

18:27.389 --> 18:31.189
You see, the problem isn't with
who I go out with.

18:31.293 --> 18:33.284
The problem is with me.

18:33.695 --> 18:37.222
Your Uncle Charlie
has major trust issues with women.

18:38.200 --> 18:42.398
And I think it might have something to do
with my relationship with my mom.

18:42.671 --> 18:44.161
I understand.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.334
Do you?

18:46.408 --> 18:49.104
No, I'm just tired and I don't care anymore.

18:51.446 --> 18:52.936
So, we're cool?

18:53.015 --> 18:55.108
- Yeah.
- Good.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.348
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:01.957 --> 19:04.289
- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah.

19:04.359 --> 19:07.351
Does this mean you don't have
nuts like a fox?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.528
Yeah.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.665
That's what it means.

19:22.311 --> 19:24.711
Don't look at my tiles, Alan.

19:26.882 --> 19:30.716
Scrabble eyes, my sweet patootie.
He's a tile peeker.

19:32.588 --> 19:36.581
Rose, listen. I think I owe you an apology.

19:36.692 --> 19:39.354
You mean for seducing me
with your roguish charms

19:39.428 --> 19:42.261
and then dumping me
like a bag of old doorknobs?

19:43.866 --> 19:46.994
That, and more recently...

19:47.769 --> 19:51.762
I told Alan that you were being nice to him
just to get close to me.

19:51.874 --> 19:55.537
And I've come to realize
that's my own paranoia about women

19:55.611 --> 19:59.843
trying to manipulate me.
And I'm sorry that I projected that on you.

20:00.649 --> 20:02.810
Come here, you big silly.

20:04.086 --> 20:06.213
- I forgive you.
- Really?

20:06.488 --> 20:07.921
Thank you.

20:09.024 --> 20:13.586
Okay. I gotta go. Your brother
is out of control with that egg timer.

20:16.865 --> 20:19.026
You think maybe I could play
with you guys?

20:19.101 --> 20:22.537
It's fine with me.
Go ask Mr. That's-not-a-word.

20:23.205 --> 20:24.570
Thanks.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.509
And again, I'm sorry.

20:28.844 --> 20:30.675
I'll be right there.

20:36.051 --> 20:38.042
Phase 1, complete.

21:08.116 --> 21:09.310
