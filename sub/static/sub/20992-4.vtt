00:14.533 --> 00:15.567
Well?

00:17.933 --> 00:20.700
I grabbed them
when Daddy wasn't looking.

00:20.767 --> 00:23.533
It was a close call...
I'm drained.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.500
Well, you better find
a good hiding spot.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.367
He'll be looking for them.

00:29.233 --> 00:31.367
I don't think
he's gonna like this.

00:31.433 --> 00:33.033
The man needs a few updates.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.367
We're providing a service.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.167
He's coming!

00:47.167 --> 00:48.167
Morning.

00:48.233 --> 00:49.200
Morning.

00:49.267 --> 00:50.467
-Hi, Daddy!
-Morning, Papi.

00:50.533 --> 00:53.300
My favorite oldest child
is looking lovely today.

00:53.367 --> 00:56.333
And how's my favorite
youngest daughter?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.733
I'm your only
youngest daughter.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.467
Really? And how--

01:00.533 --> 01:02.400
Your favorite middle kid
is making breakfast. Try them.

01:02.467 --> 01:03.633
Oh.

01:03.700 --> 01:04.733
Oh, and we're
out of coffee.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.767
I-I'll grab some
on the way to work.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.100
Mm. Mm!
I want more.

01:10.167 --> 01:11.267
Oh, wow.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.100
-Is that rosemary in there?
-It is.

01:13.167 --> 01:14.300
Mm.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.333
Dad... you gotta
unbutton that shirt,

01:16.400 --> 01:17.633
like, immediately.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.267
It makes you look
like an old man.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.367
Old man?

01:20.433 --> 01:21.467
Mm-hmm.

01:21.533 --> 01:22.833
There.
That looks better.

01:22.900 --> 01:25.167
See? Relaxed.

01:25.233 --> 01:27.633
I don't feel
more relaxed.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.633
Oh, hey, has anybody
seen my sneakers?

01:29.700 --> 01:31.067
Daddy...

01:31.067 --> 01:33.167
Why don't you wear
your nice loafers instead today?

01:33.233 --> 01:34.467
Now, you know

01:34.533 --> 01:36.433
how ballplayers
are superstitious.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.633
I need my sneakers.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.367
Uh...

01:49.633 --> 01:51.867
How did these get in there?

01:56.267 --> 01:58.400
The maids were here.

01:58.467 --> 02:01.733
Maybe they thought your shoes
could use a scrub.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.067
In the dishwasher?

02:04.067 --> 02:06.333
Right. Right.
Look, girls.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.533
I like them.
I-I'm wearing them.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.833
I'm sorry
I'm not the fashionplate

02:09.900 --> 02:10.967
you want me to be.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.767
You and the phrase
"fashionplate"

02:12.833 --> 02:14.367
don't go together.

02:14.433 --> 02:15.933
I have my own style.

02:16.067 --> 02:18.900
That wasn't
a question, Papi.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.333
What are
you looking at?

02:41.867 --> 02:44.167
"Time to retire
the Dad-mobile."

02:46.967 --> 02:48.933
I'm doomed.

03:11.833 --> 03:12.800
Hey!

03:12.867 --> 03:14.333
Hey.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.167
What's with the note?

03:16.233 --> 03:17.400
There was a time

03:17.467 --> 03:18.367
when the girls thought

03:18.433 --> 03:19.867
I could do no wrong.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.600
Mm-hmm, and now that's all
just a distant memory, huh?

03:21.667 --> 03:23.433
Yeah, they think
I dress like an old guy

03:23.500 --> 03:25.833
and they want me to stop
driving the "Dad-car."

03:25.900 --> 03:28.267
Well, I--
I was gonna say something.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.233
Were you, Todd?

03:29.300 --> 03:30.667
Little bit,
it's just that

03:30.733 --> 03:33.467
I feel like
we need to work on your image.

03:33.533 --> 03:35.367
I see, I see.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.967
Listen, I know it's tough,
but you said it yourself--

03:37.067 --> 03:38.600
you're no longer hot.

03:38.667 --> 03:39.700
Okay?

03:39.767 --> 03:41.067
But this minivan,

03:41.067 --> 03:42.333
it kind of
reinforces that point,

03:42.400 --> 03:43.600
brings it on home,
if you will.

03:43.667 --> 03:44.967
You need to be hot again, okay?

03:45.067 --> 03:46.967
And that sportscar of yours

03:47.067 --> 03:48.700
that never runs,
and this, well...

03:48.800 --> 03:50.367
well, uh,

03:50.433 --> 03:51.667
this kind of speaks for itself.

03:51.733 --> 03:52.833
It's time
to get some new wheels.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.067
And that's of no use to me,

03:54.067 --> 03:55.333
because I even can't
drive a stick.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.633
Well, that's no good.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.267
A man should know
how to drive a stick, Todd.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.500
I'm ashamed, all right?

03:59.567 --> 04:01.400
But let's bring this
back to you.

04:01.467 --> 04:02.667
This...

04:02.733 --> 04:04.533
has to go, bro.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.500
I like the minivan.

04:06.567 --> 04:07.733
You know,
it's got heated seats,

04:07.800 --> 04:10.067
the girls can
watch movies, you know?

04:10.067 --> 04:11.900
The back window has that,
you know, cute little wiper.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.700
Do you even
hear yourself?

04:13.767 --> 04:14.967
Because what I'm hearing--

04:15.067 --> 04:16.900
the part about the warm seats,

04:16.967 --> 04:19.067
and the cute little wiper--

04:19.100 --> 04:20.800
it's not sexy, Ricky.

04:20.867 --> 04:21.867
Middle-aged Dad-car?

04:21.933 --> 04:23.267
Pretty much.

04:24.367 --> 04:25.900
You know what this is about?

04:25.967 --> 04:27.800
The girls want to make me
more dateable,

04:27.867 --> 04:29.700
which is vaguely insulting.

04:29.767 --> 04:30.933
They don't think a woman

04:31.067 --> 04:32.467
would want to ride in this car.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.433
Well, they'd be right.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.967
Yeah, maybe I'm not interested
in dating a woman

04:36.067 --> 04:37.933
who's so concerned
with the kind of car I drive.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.267
That's not the point.

04:40.333 --> 04:41.500
The point is your girls.

04:41.567 --> 04:42.467
They're being really sweet
here, man.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.567
They're looking out for you.

04:43.633 --> 04:45.433
Yeah, it is pretty cute,
isn't it?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.967
It is insanely cute, Ricardo.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.367
Why don't you humor them?

04:49.433 --> 04:51.800
Get yourself
a new, worthy car,

04:51.867 --> 04:53.933
a car that says,
"I'm Ricky Cooper,

04:54.067 --> 04:55.967
"and I don't care
about heated seats

04:56.067 --> 04:57.900
and cute little wipers."

04:57.967 --> 04:59.367
You're funny.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.433
Maybe I like me just as I am.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.133
Oh. You had me at "Hello".

05:03.200 --> 05:05.533
Mirabel making you
watch romantic comedies again?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.867
Yeah, they're sick of
watching Field of Dreams.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.067
How could that be?

05:08.067 --> 05:09.067
I don't know.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.667
So what are your suggestions?

05:10.733 --> 05:12.533
What kind of car
do you think I should get?

05:12.600 --> 05:16.567
What about a Maserati sedan
with tinted windows?

05:16.633 --> 05:18.967
Or a Porsche Panamera
with racing suspension

05:19.067 --> 05:20.400
and silver wheels?

05:20.467 --> 05:21.633
Yeah, what about a Lamborghini?

05:21.700 --> 05:22.500
I love that!

05:22.567 --> 05:23.367
I'm kidding.

05:23.433 --> 05:24.300
Right.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.967
Well, uh...

05:26.067 --> 05:28.333
have a splendid day.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.433
Yeesh.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.467
-Get off of there!

05:38.533 --> 05:39.633
-Oh--
-I got it.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.633
Outliers.
That's, uh...

05:42.700 --> 05:44.100
one of my favorites.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.567
Nice. Do you ascribe
to the "10,000-Hour Rule"?

05:46.633 --> 05:47.900
Well, I definitely think that

05:47.967 --> 05:50.100
if a person devotes 10,000 hours
to any skill,

05:50.167 --> 05:51.900
they can become an expert.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.633
Except me
and ice-dancing, maybe.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.967
And me and polo.
It's a horse thing.

05:58.267 --> 06:00.500
I do think there are
exceptions, though.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.233
Renaissance artists,
for instance.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.533
I don't think you can learn
to paint The Sistine Chapel.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.933
That's a gift.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.667
Right.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.067
I'll just get a grande

06:10.100 --> 06:11.833
soy, sugar-free,
hazelnut latte.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.767
Two extra pumps,

06:13.833 --> 06:15.067
cinnamon-topped,
no foam,

06:15.100 --> 06:16.400
vanilla twist,
thanks.

06:16.467 --> 06:17.667
I hate him.

06:17.733 --> 06:18.900
I'm with you.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.600
Thanks.

06:21.733 --> 06:22.800
Ricky!

06:22.867 --> 06:24.567
Alan. Hey.
Not a good time.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.900
No. Go.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.133
Right. Yeah.
Seeya. Seeya.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.767
Hi. I'll have
a large coffee with room.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.400
And I'll have
the same.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.700
You're Ricky Cooper,
aren't you?

06:38.767 --> 06:40.633
From the Angels?
I thought I recognized you.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.900
You're a baseball fan?

06:41.967 --> 06:43.200
Actually, it was from
the commercials you did,

06:43.267 --> 06:45.067
for that sports drink
you endorsed?

06:45.067 --> 06:46.967
Oh, no. No,
those were embarrassing.

06:47.067 --> 06:50.200
Or "completely cheesy,"
as my kids like to say.

06:50.267 --> 06:52.400
Yeah, they
tease me... a lot.

06:52.467 --> 06:53.767
I didn't think
they were that bad.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.533
Aw, that's very kind.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.400
Or you have no taste at all.

06:59.467 --> 07:01.800
Ah. Keep the change.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.667
It was nice to meet you.

07:06.733 --> 07:07.800
Nicole.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.567
Enjoy the book.

07:10.633 --> 07:13.133
Thanks.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.100
Yeah!

07:16.167 --> 07:17.100
Hey, Boss.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.167
Alan.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.667
You wanna walk
to work together?

07:19.733 --> 07:20.767
Nope.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.067
Aw, come on.
I'm counting steps.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.067
No, I don't
want to count steps.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.800
I think counting steps
is weird.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.433
Oh, no, no, I live for it.
Okay?

07:27.500 --> 07:28.567
I got an idea...

07:28.633 --> 07:30.100
Let's do
a competition, okay?

07:30.167 --> 07:31.467
We'll check in with each other.

07:31.533 --> 07:32.700
Whoever wins the competition--

07:32.767 --> 07:34.167
Alan. Alan--
As you see

07:34.233 --> 07:36.233
by my untouched beverage,
I have yet to have my coffee.

07:36.300 --> 07:37.700
New rule--

07:37.767 --> 07:41.567
no talking
before I have my coffee.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.067
Okay. I just thought
maybe you might want to--

07:44.133 --> 07:45.067
No.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.267
All right.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.900
Okay. I will see you
back at work then.

07:48.967 --> 07:50.200
I'm steppin'!

07:51.533 --> 07:53.067
Take care!

07:53.067 --> 07:54.667
-Seeya!
-Seeya.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.167
And then Liam
texted a picture of us.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.700
He's just so cute sometimes.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.833
Mirabel! Wait up!

08:07.900 --> 08:12.067
Uh... save me
a seat in class.

08:12.067 --> 08:13.567
I wanted to talk to you
about our science project.

08:13.633 --> 08:14.700
"Our"?

08:14.767 --> 08:16.067
Yeah, you're my partner.

08:16.067 --> 08:19.533
Uh, you must be
mistaken, Garvin.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.200
It's "Gavin."

08:22.267 --> 08:24.200
Anyway...

08:24.267 --> 08:26.067
whatever.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.067
I guess you didn't see
the assignment list.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.700
Mr. Fingston paired us together.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.967
Oh...

08:33.067 --> 08:34.633
Seriously?

08:41.767 --> 08:43.933
How about we talk over here?

08:44.067 --> 08:46.767
Okay. I'm hoping we can
put our heads together

08:46.833 --> 08:47.933
and can come up

08:48.067 --> 08:49.633
with a really good topic
and get an "A".

08:49.700 --> 08:51.533
It's gonna be a lot of work.
Although, there will be--

08:51.600 --> 08:53.633
Here's what I need to know.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.200
What's the least amount of work
we can possibly spend on this?

08:57.267 --> 08:59.067
I have a busy social life
and, hello,

08:59.133 --> 09:01.600
these nails
don't paint themselves.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.767
Um, I don't know, exactly,

09:03.833 --> 09:06.367
but we can start tomorrow
in the courtyard.

09:06.433 --> 09:10.900
Or... how about somewhere
a lot less public?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.200
Oh...
you mean less noisy. Okay.

09:13.267 --> 09:14.900
Exactly.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.933
I'll text you.

09:19.367 --> 09:20.967
Wait. You don't have my number!

09:27.833 --> 09:29.333
Yeah! I'm up!

09:29.400 --> 09:31.667
Oh... it's just you.

09:31.733 --> 09:33.700
Is this lying on my couch
becoming a thing?

09:33.767 --> 09:34.800
Because I'm not sure
I'm into it.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.233
Sorry. I was here late,

09:36.300 --> 09:38.800
and I had to be here early
to teach yoga.

09:38.867 --> 09:40.267
And it's cozy in here.

09:40.333 --> 09:41.500
I'm glad you like it.

09:41.567 --> 09:42.900
Look, look, Steph,
if you're over-scheduled,

09:42.967 --> 09:44.667
I can hire more manpower.

09:44.733 --> 09:46.267
Actually, you can't.

09:47.233 --> 09:50.367
Remember what we talked about
at my job interview?

09:50.433 --> 09:52.667
Um, I believe
I inquired about

09:52.733 --> 09:54.767
your sketchy
past employers.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.700
Yeah, I asked you
if this was for real,

09:56.767 --> 09:59.167
or some vanity enterprise
for a bored ex-athlete.

09:59.233 --> 10:00.933
And, in retrospect,
that was kind of rude.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.067
Well, I needed job security,
and you reassured me

10:03.133 --> 10:05.033
that this was
a money-making business,

10:05.100 --> 10:06.300
not just a hobby.

10:06.367 --> 10:08.400
Your point?

10:08.467 --> 10:09.967
We're bordering
on "hobby."

10:10.033 --> 10:11.833
Your name isn't enough to get
people through the door anymore.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.667
You're not the celebrity
you once were.

10:13.733 --> 10:15.300
Hoo! Ouch.

10:15.367 --> 10:17.167
Oh, don't pout.

10:17.233 --> 10:19.933
You're a still minor celebrity.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.200
To some people.

10:21.267 --> 10:24.600
Well, I'll bankroll the gym
if I need to,

10:24.667 --> 10:25.700
but this sucks!

10:25.767 --> 10:27.767
I mean, we need
to think of something.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.700
I have an idea.

10:29.767 --> 10:32.033
But, meanwhile,
the bikes need a wipe-down.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.267
There's some
administrative paperwork

10:33.333 --> 10:34.800
that needs to be handled,

10:34.867 --> 10:36.833
and Alan's not here yet,

10:36.900 --> 10:39.800
so replacing the urinal cakes
is all you, boss.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.000
I just ran into him
at the coffee place.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.033
It's two blocks away.
What is he, lost?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.600
Who knows. He's
probably counting steps.

10:44.667 --> 10:45.833
The point is,

10:45.900 --> 10:47.167
bikes, wipe-down.
you know.

10:47.233 --> 10:48.833
Aw. My life was so glamorous.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.600
You know, I used to fly
on the team jet,

10:50.667 --> 10:51.933
people wanted my autograph,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.133
and now... urinal cakes.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.200
It happens.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.200
Have fun.

11:02.267 --> 11:03.433
Oh, yeah.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.267
Hi, Sweetie.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.067
Hi, Aunt Jackie.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.067
How's it going?

11:13.133 --> 11:15.767
Could be better.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.300
Oh, what's going on?

11:17.367 --> 11:21.067
My science teacher
has ruined my existence.

11:21.067 --> 11:24.233
Oh, and what terrible injustice
did they inflict upon you?

11:24.300 --> 11:27.133
That is the word.
"Terrible injustice."

11:27.200 --> 11:28.267
That's perfect.

11:31.100 --> 11:31.967
So...?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.433
Want one?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.733
I'm good.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.100
So?

11:37.167 --> 11:39.233
So...

11:39.300 --> 11:40.900
I have to do
a science project

11:40.967 --> 11:42.533
with Gavin Gilman.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.800
I couldn't have been paired up
with one of my 10 best friends?

11:45.867 --> 11:47.267
Or with Liam?

11:47.333 --> 11:50.967
Maybe your teacher thought
it might be a distraction.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.767
10 best friends?

11:57.100 --> 11:58.067
They're all so awesome.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.067
I'm sure they are.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.367
Now, tell me about Gavin.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.100
He's just a boy in class

12:03.167 --> 12:06.133
that raises his hand a lot
with all the answers.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.500
Hmm.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.767
Gavin.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.833
Let's just say...

12:11.900 --> 12:14.333
his fashion sense leaves
a great deal to be desired.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.167
Hmm. Poor Gavin.

12:16.233 --> 12:17.833
Poor Gavin?
Poor me!

12:17.900 --> 12:19.733
Give him a chance, Mirabel.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.067
You know?

12:21.067 --> 12:22.967
It's got to be tough
being Gavin.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.567
It's tough being me.

12:24.633 --> 12:26.833
I have to do a project
with him.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.400
What are you doing here?

12:32.467 --> 12:33.600
Gigi asked to borrow

12:33.667 --> 12:35.200
back-issues
of Smithsonian Magazine.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.400
I don't know what that means.

12:37.467 --> 12:38.833
Give yourself
some credit, Mira.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.767
You're a smart girl.

12:41.867 --> 12:43.300
I'm a lot of things...

12:43.367 --> 12:45.367
but I don't think smart
is one of them.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.567
You're wrong.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.167
I'm older.
I know better.

12:49.233 --> 12:50.400
Plus...

12:50.467 --> 12:52.433
I have some really good shoes.

12:53.867 --> 12:55.833
Oh, you do,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.467
and a killer color palette.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.400
I love the blouse.

12:59.467 --> 13:01.267
Oh, thank you.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.600
I look up to you.

13:02.667 --> 13:05.333
I mean, not with
the whole doctor thing,

13:05.400 --> 13:09.100
but fashion-wise,
you're my idol.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.300
Wow. I think
that's the nicest thing

13:11.367 --> 13:12.600
anyone's ever said to me.

13:13.567 --> 13:15.167
Thank you.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.067
-You're welcome.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.267
The dreaded Gavin.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.967
He wants to meet tomorrow.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.367
Be nice.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.900
Be patient.

13:29.967 --> 13:31.433
We can't all be you.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.067
That's true.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.433
Okay, we'll see you
tomorrow night.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.300
Uncle Bill and I
are coming for dinner.

13:39.367 --> 13:40.600
Okay?

13:41.867 --> 13:42.933
Be nice!

13:43.067 --> 13:45.300
I'll try.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.333
The assignment says

13:51.400 --> 13:52.600
to "examine
the chemical composition

13:52.667 --> 13:55.200
of everyday products,"
and, in short--

13:55.267 --> 13:57.100
Yes, please,
as short as possible.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.533
...Do a presentation

13:58.600 --> 14:00.400
on one of the items
and its components.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.533
So I came up with this list...

14:02.600 --> 14:05.167
uh, laundry detergent,
dish soap, gasoline, but--

14:05.233 --> 14:06.900
-...It's all obvious stuff--

14:06.967 --> 14:08.400
that everyone's gonna pick,

14:08.467 --> 14:09.967
and we definitely do not want
to pick the same thing

14:10.067 --> 14:11.133
as everyone else.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.300
Because that would be tragic.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.233
I know. I want to get
the best mark in class.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.333
What kind of things do you use?

14:25.467 --> 14:28.067
Products? Used every day?

14:32.267 --> 14:33.300
Toothpaste,

14:33.367 --> 14:35.067
moisturizer,

14:35.100 --> 14:36.700
makeup...

14:36.767 --> 14:39.233
I know there's lots
of chemicals in makeup.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.400
I read labels

14:40.467 --> 14:42.400
before I put anything
on my skin.

14:42.467 --> 14:43.633
Makeup?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.633
Like... Like what, specifically?

14:45.700 --> 14:47.967
The usual stuff.

14:55.167 --> 14:58.300
Mascara...
tinted base...

15:00.233 --> 15:02.233
...concealer, powder blush,

15:02.300 --> 15:04.333
eye shadow,

15:04.400 --> 15:07.200
lipstick, lip liner,
lip gloss.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.267
If I'm transitioning
from day to night,

15:09.333 --> 15:13.067
glitter gloss...
maybe eyeliner.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.167
Mirabel, this is...
This is a really great idea.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.133
Uh, it is?

15:19.200 --> 15:21.067
Yeah, it's way better
than the dumb CFL bulb idea

15:21.133 --> 15:22.133
I was gonna suggest, though.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.900
Look at all the junk in here!

15:23.967 --> 15:25.600
Uh, silica,

15:25.667 --> 15:28.233
mica, titanium dioxide--

15:28.300 --> 15:31.100
that's a white pigment
you see in a lot of cosmetics--

15:31.167 --> 15:34.300
zinc, for
the sunscreen properties.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.300
This is great.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.500
I mean, Christy and Malcolm

15:36.567 --> 15:38.067
won't come up with anything
this good.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.067
Who?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.333
They're the ones to beat.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.600
They're in our class.

15:45.267 --> 15:46.600
Yeah, still nothing.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.300
They sit
in front of you.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.600
No idea.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.600
Mirabel, this is
a really great idea.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.100
I mean,
you're really smart.

15:56.667 --> 15:59.533
Uh, so could you
repeat that,

15:59.600 --> 16:00.767
so I could record it

16:00.833 --> 16:02.433
and play it
for my sisters?

16:02.500 --> 16:05.167
Smart and funny, too.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.767
Let's not forget
good-looking.

16:08.833 --> 16:11.367
Certainly not.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.367
So, what do we do next?

16:15.433 --> 16:18.067
I mean, I shouldn't be
making all the decisions.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.767
It's your project, too.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.733
Maybe make a spreadsheet,

16:21.800 --> 16:23.167
note which mineral ingredients

16:23.233 --> 16:25.200
are naturally occurring
chemical compounds

16:25.267 --> 16:26.500
and indicate
their molecular formula

16:26.567 --> 16:29.500
using symbols
from the periodic table?

16:29.567 --> 16:32.533
I was thinking the same thing.

16:50.233 --> 16:53.167
The lions must hunt
and find food soon

16:53.233 --> 16:55.267
or they will die.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.400
Hey.

16:56.467 --> 16:58.200
Hi, Papi.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.433
I'm sorry I missed dinner.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.700
I had more work today
than I expected.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.333
You're here now.
Come snuggle with us.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.300
Ahh. Ooh.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.833
Ah! Come here.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.600
There's pizza left,
if you want some.

17:10.667 --> 17:14.767
Oh, in a minute.
Right now, I am in Dad Heaven.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.133
You want to hear what happened?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.500
Depends.

17:17.567 --> 17:18.867
If it involves
your pro-ball days,

17:18.933 --> 17:20.633
maybe not so much.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.300
Ah, it does
and it doesn't.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.200
When I stopped
for a coffee today,

17:24.267 --> 17:25.800
I was talking
to this woman in line--

17:25.867 --> 17:26.967
And you got her phone number?

17:27.067 --> 17:28.267
-You made a date?
-Was there any chemistry?

17:28.333 --> 17:29.367
Wait, wait. No. Hold on.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.333
What do you know
about chemistry?

17:31.400 --> 17:33.567
I've read about pheromones
and their role as a mating cue.

17:33.633 --> 17:35.867
Now tell us
what happened.

17:35.933 --> 17:38.667
Well, t-this woman, Nicole,

17:38.733 --> 17:41.333
um, she recognized me
from that old ad campaign.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.333
No wonder
you didn't get a date.

17:44.433 --> 17:45.400
Excuse me.

17:45.467 --> 17:46.600
Play hard!

17:46.667 --> 17:49.067
Drink up!
And feel great.

17:49.133 --> 17:50.433
Like me!

17:51.900 --> 17:53.400
My turn!

17:53.467 --> 17:55.800
Meta Support
will keep you going

17:55.867 --> 17:57.333
and keep you focused.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.933
Pull up to the power!

18:01.067 --> 18:02.567
[chuckles You want
to get in on this?

18:02.633 --> 18:05.200
As a matter of fact, I do.

18:13.067 --> 18:14.833
Hi! I'm Ricky Cooper,

18:14.900 --> 18:16.700
and when I play ball...
I play ball.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.433
After a game, or a workout,

18:18.500 --> 18:20.733
when I need
to pull up to the power,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.400
I pull up to the power
of Meta Support.

18:23.467 --> 18:26.567
Nutritious, delicious,
full of vitamins and minerals,

18:26.633 --> 18:27.967
Meta Support

18:28.067 --> 18:30.233
will keep you going
and keep you focused.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.833
On the ball, on the workout...

18:33.233 --> 18:34.467
All right, all right.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.067
It is hilarious.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.667
What'd you like
about this woman?

18:37.733 --> 18:39.400
I mean, before
she shut you down?

18:39.467 --> 18:40.733
No, she didn't shut me down.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.067
I...

18:42.100 --> 18:44.700
well, it didn't occur to me
to ask her out.

18:44.767 --> 18:46.267
Seriously?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.700
Dude...
you got to get some game.

18:47.767 --> 18:48.700
Yeah.

18:48.767 --> 18:50.667
I am wholly without game.

18:50.733 --> 18:51.767
Well, if it's
meant to be,

18:51.833 --> 18:53.867
maybe you'll run
into her again.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.300
Mm. Perhaps, by then,
I will have acquired some game.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.633
One can only hope.

19:00.533 --> 19:01.833
...Possible

19:01.900 --> 19:04.067
to drink up, play hard,
and feel great...

19:04.133 --> 19:05.733
like me!
Meta Support...

19:05.800 --> 19:08.633
it rocks!

19:08.700 --> 19:10.833
Okay. Uh, Gigi,
we can turn this off now.

19:10.900 --> 19:11.800
-It's on loop.
-Nope.

19:11.867 --> 19:12.900
Really?

19:12.967 --> 19:14.900
It's going all night.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.433
I'll have a venti mocha frap

19:31.500 --> 19:32.567
with a pump of caramel,

19:32.633 --> 19:35.567
chocolate drizzle,
and sprinkles.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.800
Hold the coffee.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.233
Things went well,
I assume?

19:44.300 --> 19:46.300
Like a charm.

19:46.367 --> 19:48.433
Here's more details
about Dad.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.900
Likes, dislikes,
and food allergies.

19:53.167 --> 19:54.967
Consider me
your own personal Cyrano.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.233
Thanks.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.733
Let's get a table.

20:03.533 --> 20:04.467
Oh.

20:04.533 --> 20:05.800
Is that
a hazelnut latte?

20:14.767 --> 20:16.367
What chapter are you on?

20:17.867 --> 20:20.767
I'm just skipping around,
finding the juicy parts.

20:20.833 --> 20:22.700
There are juicy parts?
I gotta reread that.

20:22.767 --> 20:23.833
Only if you tell me

20:23.900 --> 20:25.867
how a young pitcher
from a farm team

20:25.933 --> 20:27.733
manages a no-hitter
his first season.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.533
Ah! You do know
a little bit about baseball.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.267
Well, yeah, that
was a long time ago.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.367
You know you want to.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.400
I kinda do.

20:37.467 --> 20:38.467
Yeah.

20:38.533 --> 20:39.500
So...

20:40.600 --> 20:41.800
Once upon a time,

20:41.867 --> 20:44.400
in a land far, far away,

20:44.467 --> 20:49.367
there was this young, strapping
pitcher named Ricky Cooper.

20:56.433 --> 20:57.433
Hey!

20:57.500 --> 20:58.600
Good morning.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.667
You know,
I was thinking,

21:00.733 --> 21:02.300
I put on my moisturizer
this morning,

21:02.367 --> 21:03.333
and I thought,

21:03.400 --> 21:05.100
there should be a website

21:05.167 --> 21:06.633
that lists
the different ingredients

21:06.700 --> 21:08.067
in different products,

21:08.067 --> 21:09.867
which might not
be compatible

21:09.933 --> 21:11.667
with other ingredients
in other products,

21:11.733 --> 21:13.633
and cross-references them.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.667
Sounds like a great idea.

21:15.733 --> 21:18.267
Public service, really.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.467
Mm. Thank you.

21:20.533 --> 21:22.933
Well, see you,
Gavin.

21:25.533 --> 21:27.600
Sure, I'd enjoy
doing some coaching,

21:27.667 --> 21:29.733
But the opportunity
hasn't presented itself yet.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.933
Think you could teach 'em

21:31.067 --> 21:32.500
"Tricky Ricky's"
famous "splitter ball"?

21:32.567 --> 21:34.667
Ho! Of course.

21:37.667 --> 21:38.833
Oh!

21:39.667 --> 21:41.667
Eddie Vedder tickets
go on sale Friday.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.767
I've seen him three times.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.967
Hey, would you, um...

21:50.433 --> 21:53.067
...want to have coffee
with me sometime?

21:53.067 --> 21:56.067
Oh, we just... had two.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.700
Right. Right.
I, uh, I have no game.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.867
I meant "officially,"
uh, with a meal

22:00.933 --> 22:03.100
that is consumed
in a restaurant.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.433
Wow, I'm bad at this.

22:05.500 --> 22:05.667
It's okay.

22:05.833 --> 22:07.067
It's okay.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.067
Awkward looks good on you.
It's part of your charm.

22:09.067 --> 22:10.933
Like those lucky sneakers.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.200
I-I told you about these?

22:17.267 --> 22:18.700
Yeah.

22:18.767 --> 22:19.867
Oh.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.900
Here's my number.

22:32.067 --> 22:33.767
Okay, here we come!

22:33.833 --> 22:36.967
Grilled vegetables,
hot off the... grill.

22:37.067 --> 22:39.400
And barbecued chicken,
coming through.

22:39.467 --> 22:40.500
Excuse me.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.067
-Here you go
-Thank you.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.233
This looks amazing.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.067
And carb-free.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.267
Mirabel,

22:46.333 --> 22:48.833
I am a pediatrician,
and I'm here to tell you

22:48.900 --> 22:51.100
that carbs
are good for kids.

22:51.167 --> 22:52.167
Carbs are your friends!

22:52.233 --> 22:53.667
Mm-hmm.

22:53.733 --> 22:54.633
Have some carbs.

22:54.700 --> 22:55.733
Okay.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.667
How is the project going

22:57.733 --> 22:59.300
with dreaded
Gavin the Geek?

22:59.367 --> 23:00.733
Really?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.733
I can say it!
I was a geek.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.800
Ooh! Huge!

23:07.133 --> 23:09.100
Actually,
I think it's pretty hot.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.867
What? I do!

23:13.933 --> 23:16.067
Geeky hot-doctor wife. Wow!

23:17.367 --> 23:18.433
Awkward.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.967
It was actually okay.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.267
He turned out to be
kinda nice.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.267
I can't believe
you're doing a project

23:24.333 --> 23:26.067
and didn't ask me
for help.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.767
I feel so... slighted.

23:28.833 --> 23:31.333
Simmer down, little one.
We got this.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.933
I remember
back in school

23:33.067 --> 23:35.233
when I got paired up
with a brainiac kid,

23:35.300 --> 23:36.533
it turned out
to be great.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.100
Definitely made
things easier.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.733
Yeah, maybe for you.

23:43.333 --> 23:47.167
Um, I'm the one
who came up with the topic.

23:47.233 --> 23:49.467
Some really cool
science-y stuff, actually.

23:49.533 --> 23:51.533
Here's a tip--

23:51.600 --> 23:53.933
on your college app,
don't say "science-y."

23:54.067 --> 23:55.733
And stay clear
of "math-tastic."

23:58.300 --> 24:00.267
I think that's really cool.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.233
I'd to hear more
about your project.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.067
Sure.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.500
As a doctor, I'm sure
you're interested to hear

24:06.567 --> 24:08.067
the chemical properties

24:08.067 --> 24:09.333
in everyday
products.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.333
Enough, Gigi.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.433
Hello!

24:11.500 --> 24:13.067
She said
"chemical properties."

24:13.100 --> 24:15.067
It was kinda a pivotal moment.

24:15.100 --> 24:17.433
Wow! Tough crowd!

24:17.500 --> 24:18.933
Mm-hmm.

24:19.067 --> 24:21.267
And did you have
a nice day, Daddy?

24:21.333 --> 24:23.400
Anything, uh,
interesting happen?

24:23.467 --> 24:26.333
Uh, as a matter of fact, yes.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.100
I, uh, I ran into Nicole again.

24:29.167 --> 24:31.067
A woman he met.
She remembered

24:31.133 --> 24:31.933
his ads for
the sports drink.

24:32.067 --> 24:33.200
Oh! Mm.

24:33.267 --> 24:36.200
And she actually talked to you?
Impressive.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.900
You are a funny man, Billy.

24:38.967 --> 24:40.067
I'm here all week.

24:40.133 --> 24:41.200
That, he is.

24:41.267 --> 24:43.500
Ah, it turns out,
we have a lot in common.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.833
She likes Clint Eastwood,
Kung Pao chicken, Eddie Vedder.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.533
But, um...

24:48.600 --> 24:50.867
she doesn't like kids,

24:50.933 --> 24:52.100
dogs, or dolphins.

24:52.167 --> 24:55.200
Especially baby dolphins.

24:55.267 --> 24:56.933
But she does have
a college degree.

24:57.067 --> 24:58.233
In Forensic Podiatry,

24:58.300 --> 24:59.467
which I didn't even
know was a thing,

24:59.533 --> 25:01.400
but she can't find a job.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.633
That's not true!

25:02.700 --> 25:05.567
She's a bookkeeper!
With two poodles!

25:15.500 --> 25:16.467
Whoops.

25:17.633 --> 25:19.767
What did you do?

25:19.833 --> 25:21.200
Okay, um...

25:21.267 --> 25:25.367
things are getting very devious
in this house.

25:26.633 --> 25:28.400
And I love it.

25:28.467 --> 25:30.267
Come on,
spill more.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.233
Is she going to get
in trouble right now?

25:32.300 --> 25:34.133
'Cause that would be excellent.
-Yeah.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.067
No, she isn't.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.867
Gigi, you and I will talk later.

25:38.933 --> 25:40.333
Oh, what? Come--

25:40.400 --> 25:42.667
Richard, that is so unfair!

25:42.733 --> 25:45.833
I need to know the end
of this story.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.300
Spill it, kid.

25:47.367 --> 25:48.400
Bill, seriously?

25:48.467 --> 25:50.400
I'm with you, Uncle Bill.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.600
Let's dig in. Come on.
Everybody eat.

26:04.367 --> 26:08.200
How, exactly, did you recruit
Nicole to be my girlfriend?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.967
She applied for the position.

26:11.667 --> 26:14.100
On your birthday,
when we took applications,

26:14.167 --> 26:15.633
her qualifications were solid,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.633
and she followed up.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.367
I liked her initiative.

26:21.133 --> 26:22.567
So you, uh...

26:22.633 --> 26:24.600
gave her some details about me

26:24.667 --> 26:26.900
and then coached her
on what to say?

26:26.967 --> 26:28.500
I wanted you to like her.

26:28.567 --> 26:29.767
I did!

26:29.833 --> 26:33.167
But I liked
who she was pretending to be.

26:33.233 --> 26:34.967
But she really does
love baseball!

26:35.067 --> 26:37.267
It was on
her statement of interest.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.233
Oh... it's, it's, it's okay.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.367
It's over,

26:45.433 --> 26:48.067
but just no more meddling.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.900
Go. Go get your PJs on.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.967
Good night, honey.
Thank you.

26:56.067 --> 26:59.067
'Kay, see you soon.
Sleep tight. Mwah!

26:59.133 --> 27:00.967
We're going to head out.
Thank you for dinner.

27:01.067 --> 27:02.800
Of course! Of course.

27:02.867 --> 27:04.167
That was delicious.
Thanks, bro.

27:04.233 --> 27:05.167
It's all about
the sauce!

27:05.233 --> 27:06.567
Poblano, baby.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.267
Listen, um...

27:10.333 --> 27:12.967
I think you might have hurt
Mirabel's feelings earlier.

27:13.067 --> 27:14.633
How?

27:14.700 --> 27:17.167
What are you
talking about?

27:17.233 --> 27:19.700
She was talking
about her homework,

27:19.767 --> 27:21.067
and I thought
you could've acted

27:21.067 --> 27:22.367
a little bit
more interested.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.500
Paid her a compliment.

27:23.567 --> 27:26.300
But I compliment Mirabel
all the time.

27:26.367 --> 27:28.067
On the right things?

27:28.100 --> 27:30.533
Oh... right.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.867
I get it.

27:31.933 --> 27:34.100
Wait, all right?
What are you guys referring to?

27:34.167 --> 27:36.133
She should know
you support and love her

27:36.200 --> 27:37.200
for all of her merits,

27:37.267 --> 27:38.767
not just her beauty.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.800
Look, Mirabel
needs to know

27:40.867 --> 27:42.167
that you think
she's smart,

27:42.233 --> 27:43.233
little brother.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.667
She is smart!

27:44.733 --> 27:47.067
I mean, a lot smarter than
she's given credit for.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.233
Right, because
she's so beautiful.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.700
Exactly.

27:49.767 --> 27:52.400
Ahh... you're right.
You're right.

27:52.467 --> 27:54.933
I-I need to, uh...
pay more attention to that.

27:55.067 --> 27:56.433
You're doing great.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.300
I just wanted to point it out,

27:58.367 --> 28:00.100
because she said something
to me earlier

28:00.167 --> 28:01.833
that made me realize

28:01.900 --> 28:05.100
that she genuinely doesn't
believe that she's smart...

28:05.167 --> 28:07.067
and that sucks.

28:07.100 --> 28:09.567
I-I-I don't get it.

28:09.633 --> 28:12.200
That girl has
everything going for her.

28:12.267 --> 28:13.267
Mm-hmm.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.067
She sure does.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.067
"O, was the power,

28:16.133 --> 28:17.633
"the gift to give us

28:17.700 --> 28:21.067
to see ourselves
as others see us."

28:23.700 --> 28:25.067
What?

28:25.133 --> 28:28.700
I wish she could see herself
the way we see her.

28:28.767 --> 28:30.567
Oh, really? Come on!

28:30.633 --> 28:33.200
I have two advanced
degrees, people.

28:33.267 --> 28:34.767
Robert Burns?

28:34.833 --> 28:35.900
Classic!

28:35.967 --> 28:38.633
Once in a while,
after all these years,

28:38.700 --> 28:40.533
you surprise me

28:40.600 --> 28:43.233
and remind me
why I love you.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.400
Come here.

28:44.467 --> 28:45.867
-I'm goin' in. I'm goin' in!
-Mwah.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.567
What she said,
without the lippy-lippy.

28:48.633 --> 28:50.600
Okay.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.367
Oh!

28:53.433 --> 28:55.067
Derek Jeter?

28:55.133 --> 28:57.333
I haven't heard from him
in a while.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.700
I love that guy.
What'd he say?

28:58.767 --> 28:59.767
No...

28:59.833 --> 29:02.467
What's the matter?

29:02.533 --> 29:05.400
"Stay away from...
'Psycho Nicole'."

29:07.167 --> 29:08.100
Wow.

29:08.167 --> 29:10.467
Ho...

29:11.833 --> 29:14.100
Nicole is a baseball groupie.

29:14.167 --> 29:15.633
Ah, look.

29:15.700 --> 29:17.800
There's Danny Barnes.

29:17.867 --> 29:20.700
And, uh... ha!
Jesse Chavez.

29:20.767 --> 29:23.400
She stalks
baseball players!

29:23.467 --> 29:25.300
I don't
understand...

29:25.367 --> 29:26.533
I vetted her.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.167
I'm guessing
she didn't tell you

29:28.233 --> 29:30.733
her Twitter name
is "NikiHeartsplayers".

29:30.800 --> 29:32.667
I dodged a bullet
with this one.

29:32.733 --> 29:34.733
So, she only wanted
to date Daddy

29:34.800 --> 29:36.100
because he's famous?

29:36.167 --> 29:37.600
He's not so famous.

29:37.667 --> 29:41.833
Okay. You're still famous
to baseball stalkers.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.267
They're called
"cleat-chasers".

29:43.333 --> 29:45.600
Ah, here's the one
that Jeter saw posted.

29:48.467 --> 29:49.333
-Aw...
-Ooh. Not your best angle.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.133
The old stealthy-selfie.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.800
Impressive...

29:53.867 --> 29:55.267
yet incredibly creepy.

29:55.333 --> 29:56.267
Can you say "psycho"?

29:56.333 --> 29:57.500
I'll deal with it...

29:57.567 --> 29:59.800
but, yes,
I can say psycho.

29:59.867 --> 30:01.667
You've got to learn
to take social cues, Daddy.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.300
If anyone seems too perfect,
they are.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.433
I am not.

30:11.567 --> 30:12.867
-Say "thank you".
-Thank you.

30:12.933 --> 30:14.267
You're welcome.

30:14.333 --> 30:16.867
I built us
a kick-ass new website.

30:16.933 --> 30:19.233
People can register for classes
online,

30:19.300 --> 30:21.500
read about you, and me,
and God help us, Alan.

30:21.567 --> 30:22.833
I put advertisements
on other sites,

30:22.900 --> 30:24.400
we're getting new machines,

30:24.467 --> 30:26.100
and that is just
the beginning.

30:26.167 --> 30:27.633
You are amazing.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.833
I am.

30:28.900 --> 30:30.467
But you can look
at it later.

30:30.533 --> 30:31.533
I need
to talk to you.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.733
Okay.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.867
I heard about
your run-in

30:34.933 --> 30:35.867
with the cleat-chaser.

30:35.933 --> 30:36.867
Oh, God...

30:36.933 --> 30:38.133
Yeah, the girls called me.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.633
They thought you could use
some cheering up.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.667
So, you were fooled

30:41.733 --> 30:44.200
by whack-job
baseball-fanatic chick?

30:44.267 --> 30:45.400
What're you gonna do?

30:45.467 --> 30:46.900
Well, she didn't seem
like a whack-job.

30:46.967 --> 30:48.867
You know, she seemed normal.
Nice.

30:48.933 --> 30:52.200
Maybe knew my stats
a little too well.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.967
What is-- What is--
What is with people?

30:55.033 --> 30:57.300
Well, it's like my grandfather
Roland used to say--

30:57.367 --> 30:58.833
"People... problems."

30:58.900 --> 31:00.300
Roland is right.

31:00.367 --> 31:01.533
He made
a mean julep.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.867
Oh, I would
like Roland!

31:02.933 --> 31:03.900
Mm-hmm.

31:03.967 --> 31:05.300
Yeah, this dating
is a, uh...

31:05.367 --> 31:06.633
it's a tricky business.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.900
Yeah, I am well aware of that.

31:08.967 --> 31:10.867
And I am not getting off
to a good start.

31:10.933 --> 31:13.633
I've been at it for a decade
and I suck.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.633
Oh, that's awful.
A decade?

31:15.700 --> 31:17.633
Yeah, I once had a guy
pick me up in his mom's sedan,

31:17.700 --> 31:19.800
and his mom was driving.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.867
Wait, you don't mean...
did she go on the date with you?

31:21.933 --> 31:24.233
Yeah, apparently,
they were very close,

31:24.300 --> 31:25.867
and we split the check
three ways.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.200
Wow!

31:27.267 --> 31:28.367
And another guy

31:28.433 --> 31:29.733
sold pressure-sensitive
adhesives,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.800
and that is all he talked about.

31:31.867 --> 31:34.700
It took me two ibuprofen
and three Margaritas

31:34.767 --> 31:36.233
to get through that evening.

31:36.300 --> 31:38.633
And then there's the story
about the mime,

31:38.700 --> 31:41.200
and I will save that
for another time.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.267
I hate mimes.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.533
Everybody hates mimes.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.800
Hey, uh,
Stephanie.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.200
Thank you.

31:46.267 --> 31:48.533
You're welcome.

31:53.933 --> 31:55.267
Hey!

31:55.333 --> 31:56.233
Hello.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.267
Come in.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.400
Make yourself
at home.

32:02.467 --> 32:03.667
Okay.

32:03.733 --> 32:05.300
So, I was
thinking about

32:05.367 --> 32:09.067
our presentation/project/
spreadsheet thingie.

32:09.067 --> 32:11.733
The symbols from
the periodic table, uh-huh.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.433
And one word
kept coming to mind--

32:13.500 --> 32:14.433
"Dull."

32:14.500 --> 32:16.967
Uh, I hear that a lot.

32:17.067 --> 32:19.200
I didn't mean you, silly.

32:19.267 --> 32:20.900
I like you.

32:20.967 --> 32:22.800
You're nice,
and not dull.

32:22.867 --> 32:24.933
I'm so happy.

32:26.667 --> 32:28.800
So, here's what I was thinking.

32:28.867 --> 32:32.733
Mr. Fingston didn't just say
do a report.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.567
He said "A presentation."

32:35.633 --> 32:38.733
Well, presentation happens to be
something I'm an expert in.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.967
As you can see.

32:40.067 --> 32:42.200
I can, I do,
and you are.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.900
So what'd you have in mind?

32:44.967 --> 32:46.833
Visual aids.

32:46.900 --> 32:50.267
We'll start out
with a neutral base...

32:50.333 --> 32:53.733
add some pops of color,

32:53.800 --> 32:57.500
then organize them
in attractive vertical columns.

32:57.567 --> 33:00.067
Substance and aesthetics. Cool.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.067
Here's the best part.

33:02.100 --> 33:05.833
We'll also offer
an interactive experience.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.600
Zinc oxide
anyone can try.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.133
I'll never wash it off.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.500
Oh, please do.
You look kinda goofy that way.

33:15.567 --> 33:17.067
Here.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.600
Thanks.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.767
I'm so lucky to have you
as a partner, Mirabela.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.800
You're so incredibly innovative
and smart.

33:26.767 --> 33:28.567
Thank you.

33:28.633 --> 33:31.900
Beginning to think so, too.

33:34.633 --> 33:38.067
Well, you wanted to beat
Christy and Malcolm, right?

33:38.100 --> 33:39.733
Mm-hmm.

33:41.900 --> 33:44.467
Oh... and, on the day
of the presentation,

33:44.533 --> 33:46.967
you gotta untuck that shirt.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.600
This whole
"nerdy-professor look"

33:48.667 --> 33:51.467
needs to be
a tad more casual.

33:51.533 --> 33:53.933
Got it.

33:55.700 --> 33:56.900
Keep your style.

33:56.967 --> 34:00.100
It's important to your charm.

34:00.167 --> 34:01.067
I have charm?

34:01.133 --> 34:03.533
Yes, Gavin.

34:03.600 --> 34:06.533
Stop talking
about yourself so much.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.067
Let's get to work.

34:24.533 --> 34:25.400
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.467
Bye.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.533
Ah, that was
your science partner,

34:47.600 --> 34:48.667
I'm guessing?

34:48.733 --> 34:49.667
Yeah.

34:49.733 --> 34:50.767
How'd it go today?

34:50.833 --> 34:52.667
I think we had
a breakthrough.

34:52.733 --> 34:54.733
Our report is on
chemicals and stuff,

34:54.800 --> 34:56.633
and we've totally
turned our presentation

34:56.700 --> 34:58.600
into something
"wow-tastic".

34:58.667 --> 35:00.700
Well, that's great, honey.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.667
I love seeing you committed
to your schoolwork,

35:02.733 --> 35:05.133
and so interested
in the sciences.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.600
Uh, don't get
carried away, old man.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.800
You know we're
only doing this

35:09.867 --> 35:12.533
because the teacher's
making us, right?

35:12.600 --> 35:15.067
Oh, of course.
Who does recreational science?

35:15.100 --> 35:17.633
But, that being said,

35:17.700 --> 35:21.133
um, it seems like
you're enjoying it.

35:22.767 --> 35:24.767
Can I tell you something, Dad?

35:24.833 --> 35:26.767
Of course.
You can tell me anything.

35:29.333 --> 35:34.700
Gavin makes me feel like
I'm more than I am.

35:34.767 --> 35:36.667
He's the first boy
who's ever treated me

35:36.733 --> 35:39.767
like I'm smart,
and not just... pretty.

35:39.833 --> 35:43.067
You are so smart, Mirabel.

35:43.133 --> 35:44.767
Now, maybe
I don't say it enough,

35:44.833 --> 35:47.833
but I think you are
a very smart young woman.

35:47.900 --> 35:49.800
Well, Gigi thinks I'm dumb.

35:49.867 --> 35:51.967
Gigi thinks
Stephen Hawking is dumb.

35:53.567 --> 35:54.733
She likes teasing you,

35:54.800 --> 35:56.767
but she looks up to you.

35:56.833 --> 35:58.900
And so does Elisa,
and so do I.

35:58.967 --> 36:00.333
-You do?
-Yeah!

36:00.400 --> 36:02.833
Yeah, you're kind and funny
and loyal.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.067
You look out your sisters.

36:04.100 --> 36:07.100
There are a lot
of wonderful qualities

36:07.167 --> 36:09.233
going on behind
that gorgeous face of yours.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.200
Well, I'm not complaining

36:11.267 --> 36:13.533
that the other kids
think I'm pretty, though.

36:13.600 --> 36:14.633
I like that, too.

36:14.700 --> 36:15.833
Nah, there's nothing wrong

36:15.900 --> 36:17.233
with getting
that kind of attention.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.533
You know, I know a little bit
about that myself.

36:19.600 --> 36:20.933
Yes, Daddy.

36:21.067 --> 36:22.933
You were
a big baseball star.

36:23.067 --> 36:25.200
Yeah, yeah,
I loved meeting fans,

36:25.267 --> 36:27.700
signing autographs.

36:27.767 --> 36:29.400
But, at the end of the day,

36:29.467 --> 36:32.067
you want people to love you
for who you really are.

36:32.100 --> 36:35.467
Yeah.

36:35.533 --> 36:36.833
You're a really great guy, Dad.

36:36.900 --> 36:37.767
Aww.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.067
I mean...

36:39.100 --> 36:42.333
but we still have some things
to work on,

36:42.400 --> 36:43.967
but all in all,
you're pretty awesome.

36:44.067 --> 36:45.600
Thanks.

36:45.667 --> 36:49.067
You know, I hope you have
more friends like Gavin,

36:49.133 --> 36:52.167
who, uh, appreciate

36:52.233 --> 36:54.500
that there are
other sides to you.

36:54.567 --> 36:55.933
Me too.

36:56.067 --> 36:58.133
And to think,
that just a week ago,

36:58.200 --> 37:01.833
I didn't want anyone
to see me talking to him.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.600
Yeah, that's not very nice.

37:03.667 --> 37:05.300
I know.

37:05.367 --> 37:08.067
I gotta remedy that, stat.

37:09.167 --> 37:11.067
Come on.

37:21.067 --> 37:22.067
Ahem!

37:22.133 --> 37:23.733
Oh! Hi.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.067
I was so happy
I got your call.

37:26.067 --> 37:27.333
You're about to be less happy.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.900
I know about
you and Gigi conspiring.

37:30.967 --> 37:34.067
Well, I think
she was just trying to help.

37:34.067 --> 37:36.900
She just wants us
to get to know one another.

37:36.967 --> 37:38.733
But you already know
so many people.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.100
Felix Hernandez,
Mike Trout.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.967
Oh! Uh, and Jeter says hi,
by the way.

37:44.067 --> 37:45.900
What can I say?

37:45.967 --> 37:47.400
I love the game.

37:47.467 --> 37:50.367
I think you love
more than the game.

37:52.067 --> 37:55.833
Listen, um, I get my photo
taken with celebrity athletes,

37:55.900 --> 37:57.400
and I collect memorabilia.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.100
It's, uh, it's just a hobby.

37:59.167 --> 38:01.367
Yeah, a creepy one at that.

38:01.433 --> 38:02.933
But I like you.

38:03.067 --> 38:05.867
And when your daughters
put out that APB

38:05.933 --> 38:07.167
that you needed a girlfriend,

38:07.233 --> 38:09.833
I just, uh, I took it
as a chance to meet you.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.433
And so you have.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.267
I'm gonna call this.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.400
Okay, fine.

38:14.467 --> 38:16.700
But can I get
a favor from you?

38:16.767 --> 38:20.167
Wow, you are pushing it,
fan-girl.

38:20.233 --> 38:22.300
Can I get your autograph?

38:23.433 --> 38:25.400
Sure.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.067
Wow.

38:31.133 --> 38:33.133
Um...

38:36.400 --> 38:38.800
This is the one.

38:38.867 --> 38:40.167
Just...

38:40.233 --> 38:41.467
Okay.

38:41.533 --> 38:42.633
All right.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.333
I'm good.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.333
Yeah?

38:45.400 --> 38:49.200
Oh, not so fast, Cooper.

38:50.433 --> 38:51.333
Oh, that's enough.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.367
Just one more!

38:52.433 --> 38:54.067
No, no,
now we're good.

38:55.433 --> 38:58.067
Ricky! Hey!
How you doing?

38:58.067 --> 39:02.133
Oh, what's, uh,
what's going on, Alan?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.167
I'm just stepping. Stepping.
Our stepping competition.

39:04.233 --> 39:06.067
No, that was never
a thing, Alan.

39:06.100 --> 39:08.233
I did not agree
to a step competition,

39:08.300 --> 39:09.667
nor would I ever.

39:09.733 --> 39:12.067
Okay, but you should.
It's all about the PaceIt.

39:12.133 --> 39:13.367
-I'll get you one!
-Sweet.

39:13.433 --> 39:14.967
What color do you want?

39:15.067 --> 39:16.200
Surprise me.

39:17.500 --> 39:20.267
Blue for the boss!
See you at work!

39:23.367 --> 39:24.500
Want to sit with me?

39:24.567 --> 39:26.333
We can work on
our presentation.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.433
It's not
for another week.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.933
Oh, right.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.333
Plus, we're gonna be
naturally awesome.

39:32.400 --> 39:35.933
Why don't you just
come hang out and eat?

39:42.533 --> 39:44.200
Why don't I just eat

39:44.267 --> 39:45.800
with you
and your friends?

39:50.133 --> 39:52.067
O.M.G.

39:52.067 --> 39:53.833
This is the moment
I've been waiting for,

39:53.900 --> 39:55.933
but was fairly certain
would never arrive.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.800
Yet here it is.

39:57.867 --> 40:00.033
Mirabel Cooper
eating lunch with me.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.333
Work it, Gavin.

40:29.133 --> 40:31.000
Oh, my gosh!

40:31.067 --> 40:33.233
You are totally
Steve McQueen!

40:33.300 --> 40:34.767
I kinda am.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.167
It's so hot.

40:36.233 --> 40:37.900
Yeah, it's good.

40:37.967 --> 40:39.067
-Can I drive it?
-You can't.

40:39.133 --> 40:40.400
It's a stick.

40:40.467 --> 40:41.867
Come on!
You're killing me, man!

40:41.933 --> 40:43.467
Rent a stick-shift
and I'll teach you.

40:43.533 --> 40:45.100
Why can't you teach me on this?

40:45.167 --> 40:46.267
And that's
your first lesson.

40:46.333 --> 40:49.533
Mirabel! Elisa! Gigi!

40:49.600 --> 40:51.100
Can you come
outside, please?

40:51.167 --> 40:52.400
Yeah, the guy
who owns it's retiring,

40:52.467 --> 40:53.500
so I bought it.

40:53.567 --> 40:54.867
Bought what?

40:54.933 --> 40:56.067
The dealership.

40:56.133 --> 40:58.067
What's going on?

40:58.133 --> 40:59.467
I have something
to show you.

40:59.533 --> 41:01.233
What do you think?

41:02.633 --> 41:05.467
This is definitely
not a Dad car.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.267
I love it!

41:09.333 --> 41:10.933
It's so hot.

41:11.067 --> 41:12.100
When can we go
for a ride?

41:12.167 --> 41:13.133
You know what?
Shotgun.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.267
-Uh-uh.
-Okay.

41:15.533 --> 41:18.067
You're gonna look so good
in this car, Dad.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.633
It'll totally up your game.
Women will swarm.

41:20.700 --> 41:23.267
I have no "game" to up,
but I'm working on it.

41:23.333 --> 41:25.167
And when I find the right woman,

41:25.233 --> 41:27.333
she will like me for who I am,

41:27.400 --> 41:29.133
which is a father,
who has lucky--

41:29.200 --> 41:30.167
Smelly!

41:30.233 --> 41:31.700
...Sneakers,

41:31.767 --> 41:35.133
and the three most amazing
daughters in the world. Okay?

41:35.200 --> 41:37.067
Let's ride!

41:43.300 --> 41:44.900
See you in
a couple weeks, Todd.

41:44.967 --> 41:46.867
See you later.
Have fun.
