Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

00:23.165 --> 00:24.597
You know there are easier ways
to kill me,

00:24.665 --> 00:25.698
if you're worried
I'll rat you out

00:25.765 --> 00:26.999
for cheating on the LSATs.

00:27.067 --> 00:28.669
- What? Come on, Rachel.
- Unbelievable.

00:28.737 --> 00:32.208
Rachel!

00:32.276 --> 00:34.944
Rachel, come on,
let me buy you a fresh cup.

00:35.012 --> 00:36.113
Are you actually
gonna buy it this time,

00:36.181 --> 00:37.414
or are you gonna steal it?

00:37.482 --> 00:39.417
Okay, first of all,
I don't steal, I cheat.

00:39.485 --> 00:41.488
There's a big difference.
And I don't do it anymore.

00:41.556 --> 00:42.991
Oh, great defense.

00:43.059 --> 00:44.759
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I know that I murdered her,

00:44.826 --> 00:47.797
but I promise
I won't do it anymore.

00:47.865 --> 00:50.168
Look, I understand
why you're mad,

00:50.236 --> 00:52.003
but I still don't think
you're being entirely fair.

00:52.071 --> 00:55.207
Not fair? What's not fair
is that you repeatedly

00:55.275 --> 00:56.941
help people skirt a system
that stands in the way

00:57.009 --> 00:58.945
of me becoming a lawyer.
You know what?

00:59.013 --> 01:00.346
Why don't you give up
the whole Saint act,

01:00.414 --> 01:02.147
since the only reason
you figured out I was cheating

01:02.215 --> 01:03.748
is 'cause you were thinkin'
about cheating yourself.

01:03.816 --> 01:05.248
Thinking about cheating
and actually doing it

01:05.316 --> 01:07.385
are two very different things,

Whoa! Wait,

You know,

01:14.458 --> 01:15.624
for someone
with a freak brain,

01:15.692 --> 01:18.059
you manage to forget everything
important.

01:18.127 --> 01:20.961

01:32.407 --> 01:33.874
Who said passion
wasn't productive?

01:33.942 --> 01:36.645
I don't know anyone
that's ever said that.

01:36.712 --> 01:39.348
- Jones, tell me something.
- Mm.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.650
You have 30 hotels
in 12 different countries,

01:41.718 --> 01:45.254
but you spent last week
in Daniel Vega's Lisbon resort.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.156
What? Just, you know,
checkin' out the competition.

01:48.224 --> 01:49.524
That was more
than a fact-finding mission.

01:49.592 --> 01:51.259
You're thinking merger.

01:51.327 --> 01:52.727
Do you honestly believe
that I'd do that

01:52.795 --> 01:54.128
without talking to you first?

01:54.195 --> 01:56.897
- I know you would.
- Then perhaps I did.

01:56.965 --> 01:59.132
Jones, if you try
to pursue a merger,

01:59.199 --> 02:01.233
you may not control
what happens to your business

02:01.301 --> 02:02.801
that you built
so passionately.

02:02.869 --> 02:04.603
Okay, Sherlock,
hear me out.

02:04.670 --> 02:08.607
Combined, we're 100 hotels
in 23 countries.

02:08.675 --> 02:10.743
I like
having multiple homes.

02:10.810 --> 02:12.644
But you don't need
another name on the mortgage.

02:12.712 --> 02:14.380
- It's a good deal.
- Yeah, and it's my job

02:14.448 --> 02:16.015
to get you
a better one, okay?

02:16.083 --> 02:18.218
Promise me you didn't do
a handshake deal.

02:41.974 --> 02:44.475

02:44.542 --> 02:47.278
- And let me guess, Harvey was--
- Oh, legendary.

02:47.345 --> 02:48.846
Shocking.

02:48.914 --> 02:50.849
Sydney Thompson
was a consultant

02:50.916 --> 02:53.418
with
Lunders Global Initiative.

02:53.485 --> 02:55.253
She had a few too many,
and decided to entertain

02:55.321 --> 02:58.090
her friends with
an impersonation of her boss,

02:58.157 --> 02:59.524
Lena Lunders.

02:59.592 --> 03:01.126
This impersonation
was recorded

03:01.194 --> 03:03.996
and uploaded onto
a social networking site.

03:04.064 --> 03:07.500
The next day
she was fired.

03:07.567 --> 03:10.303
Sydney is now suing
for wrongful termination.

03:10.371 --> 03:11.805
We are looking to see
how you do under pressure.

03:11.873 --> 03:13.707
Can't cheat your way
out of this one.

03:13.775 --> 03:16.176
The partners
have been instructed

03:16.244 --> 03:19.479
to only use the associates
in emergency situations.

03:24.619 --> 03:25.885
Let the games begin.

03:25.953 --> 03:28.121
- Whoo!
- All right.

step up and meet your match.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.259

Jocelyn Lowenstein.

03:44.373 --> 03:45.507
It was a total waste
of my talent.

03:45.574 --> 03:46.775
Wait a minute,
you play witnesses?

03:46.843 --> 03:48.910
Oh, I don't play anything.

03:48.978 --> 03:52.781
I embody. And if I'm
on your team, you're a winner.

03:52.849 --> 03:54.350
- Well, in that case--
- No.

03:54.417 --> 03:55.818

05:25.662 --> 05:28.030
Okay, please, sensei?

05:32.303 --> 05:36.373
Listen to me.
Don't go to trial.

05:36.441 --> 05:38.709
It's a mock trial.
I think the trial part

05:38.777 --> 05:40.745
is kind of
a prerequisite.

05:40.813 --> 05:43.882
All right.
Law is about control, okay?

05:43.950 --> 05:47.586
You can only control so much
with a jury, judge,

05:47.654 --> 05:50.189
witnesses, and another lawyer
with an ego complex.

05:50.257 --> 05:51.457
What if the lawyer
doesn't have an ego complex?

05:51.525 --> 05:53.326
Every lawyer
has an ego complex.

05:53.393 --> 05:55.194
The firm has presented
an exercise

05:55.261 --> 05:57.629
where there's potential
for failure, okay?

05:57.697 --> 05:59.765
All I'm saying is
try and create a situation

05:59.832 --> 06:01.734
where that's not
even a possibility.

06:01.801 --> 06:04.403
Kobayashi Maru.

06:06.506 --> 06:08.206
<i>Star Trek.</i>
Captain Kirk.

06:08.274 --> 06:10.675
He wins a no-win situation
by rewriting the rules.

06:10.743 --> 06:13.211
- You're a Trekkie.
- Hey, Captain Kirk is the man,

06:13.279 --> 06:14.712
okay? I don't wanna hear
another word about it.

06:14.780 --> 06:17.115
Now, enough with
your fake law problem.

06:17.183 --> 06:20.085
Let's deal with my real one.
Aye, aye, Captain.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.226
You wanna know
how to do a cross?

06:26.294 --> 06:28.128
Some people
like to use big words.

06:28.196 --> 06:30.331
Some people like
to go for sympathy.

06:30.398 --> 06:31.765
But personally,

06:31.833 --> 06:33.801
I'm a little more go
for the groin.

06:33.869 --> 06:35.536
Oh, hey, Mike.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.237

the peanut gallery

06:37.305 --> 06:39.573

I'm sorry, guys.

06:39.641 --> 06:41.541
Looks like Ross here
came to plead for mercy.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.444
Wow.

06:44.511 --> 06:46.179
If you're here for
the witness/exhibit exchange,

06:46.246 --> 06:47.480
don't bother.

06:47.547 --> 06:48.680
I already
know who you're gonna call

06:48.748 --> 06:50.249
and what evidence
you're gonna use.

06:50.316 --> 06:52.217
Actually, I'm not gonna
call any witnesses

06:52.285 --> 06:54.619
or present any evidence.
Let's settle.

06:54.687 --> 06:56.355
Or I can beat you.

06:56.422 --> 06:57.690
The plaintiff has shown
a pattern of making

06:57.757 --> 06:59.258
derogatory statements
about my client.

06:59.326 --> 07:00.593
- Hearsay.
- Not the emails.

07:00.661 --> 07:02.095
Which have
no tone of voice

07:02.162 --> 07:03.563
and are subject
to interpretation.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.499
Which is exactly why
your argument is shaky at best.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.802
- Then beat me in court.
- Kyle.

07:07.870 --> 07:10.538
There's a reason that Harvey
chose me to be his guy.

07:10.606 --> 07:13.074
Do you really wanna
find out what that reason is?

07:15.011 --> 07:17.713
And how do I know
this isn't some sort of trick?

07:17.780 --> 07:19.681
It's not a trick.

07:19.749 --> 07:22.584
This is our chance
to stand out.

07:22.651 --> 07:23.851
Look, settling gets us
in and out of there

07:23.919 --> 07:25.353
in five minutes.

07:25.420 --> 07:27.287
You drop the suit, and you and I

07:27.355 --> 07:29.490
making ourselves
indispensable to the partners

07:29.557 --> 07:31.258
while everyone else
buries their heads

07:31.326 --> 07:33.326
in Candyland court.

07:35.963 --> 07:37.798
I'm going against
my better judgment

07:37.866 --> 07:39.600
and trusting you.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.402
So we have a deal.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.978
Daniel,
paperwork looks good,

07:49.045 --> 07:52.181
despite the fact that you two
decided to go lawyer commando.

07:52.249 --> 07:53.583
The devil's always
in the details.

07:53.651 --> 07:55.418
Harvey, I know
that impulse purchases

07:55.486 --> 07:58.021
don't exist in your world,
but the timing was right.

07:58.089 --> 08:00.056
And as for the details,

08:00.123 --> 08:02.024
I'd like to leave that
to my man Scott.

08:02.092 --> 08:03.091

08:03.159 --> 08:04.426

09:42.654 --> 09:44.756
Mm, remember
the mining deal?

09:44.823 --> 09:47.726
Shaft 27?
How could I forget?

09:50.530 --> 09:52.531
Listen, about
the due diligence--

09:52.599 --> 09:55.300
Ah, ah, ah,
Harvey.

09:55.368 --> 09:56.969
You know the rules.

09:59.673 --> 10:01.573
No case negotiations
till we're done.

10:01.641 --> 10:02.841
I think that
might be a while.

10:16.071 --> 10:18.038
Couldn't resist seeing
brilliance in action, huh?

10:18.106 --> 10:19.606
Actually,
I have to be here.

10:19.674 --> 10:21.675
I'm playing the part
of the plaintiff.

10:21.743 --> 10:23.510
Wow. I knew you
were pissed,

10:23.578 --> 10:25.145
but I didn't realize
you were petty.

10:25.212 --> 10:26.880
- What does that mean?
- It's an adjective.

10:26.948 --> 10:28.948
It means small-minded
and spiteful.

10:29.016 --> 10:30.750
You chose to work with the one
guy who's going against me.

10:30.818 --> 10:32.685
- Kyle asked me, and I said yes.
- You know what?

10:32.752 --> 10:34.153
It doesn't really matter,
'cause you're never

10:34.221 --> 10:35.788
gonna take the stand.
Really? How's that?

10:35.855 --> 10:37.356
It's a surprise.

10:37.423 --> 10:40.626
But prepare to watch
a mock trial legend be born.

10:44.464 --> 10:46.899
Is counsel ready to proceed
with opening statements?

10:46.967 --> 10:48.901
We'd like to submit
a settlement agreement--

10:48.969 --> 10:51.604
The plaintiff is ready,
Your Honor.

10:51.672 --> 10:53.640
Which is it,
counselor?

10:53.707 --> 10:55.508
Um, the counsel
for the plaintiff

10:55.576 --> 10:57.911
and I agreed
to a settlement yesterday.

10:57.978 --> 10:59.479
He must've misunderstood.
We had discussed,

10:59.547 --> 11:00.747
but I never agreed
to anything.

11:00.815 --> 11:02.882
Do you have
a signed agreement?

11:02.950 --> 11:04.851
Uh...

11:06.153 --> 11:07.587
No.

11:07.655 --> 11:09.055
Then we are ready
to proceed.

11:09.123 --> 11:10.624
You have the floor.

11:10.691 --> 11:12.859
Thank you.

11:12.927 --> 11:15.028
On March 31, 2010,

11:15.096 --> 11:16.963
Sydney Thompson
was unwittingly recorded

11:17.031 --> 11:18.498
on a cell phone.

11:18.566 --> 11:20.166
She made a joke,
the type of joke

11:20.234 --> 11:22.735
that I'm sure every person
in this courtroom

11:22.803 --> 11:24.738
has made at one point
or another...

11:37.085 --> 11:39.687
Mr. Ross.

11:39.755 --> 11:42.490
Mr. Ross!

11:42.558 --> 11:44.726
Are you ready?

11:44.793 --> 11:46.794
Um, the, uh,

11:46.862 --> 11:49.030
the defense...

11:49.098 --> 11:50.598
Uh...

11:52.935 --> 11:54.736
According to
Bowmaster v. Whitely,

11:54.803 --> 11:56.604
if the party to a settlement
is surprised

11:56.672 --> 11:58.472
by the repudiation
of the settlement,

11:58.540 --> 12:01.108
then the court must provide
a reasonable amount of time

12:01.176 --> 12:03.211
to prepare for the trial.

12:04.747 --> 12:06.280
- Reasonable time.
- Yes, Your Honor.

12:06.348 --> 12:08.850
You get five minutes.

12:08.918 --> 12:10.251
Vega has
more property.

12:10.319 --> 12:11.952
Debeque has
more potential.

12:13.322 --> 12:15.155
Which is harder
to monetarily define.

12:15.223 --> 12:17.057
This isn't a library,
Scottie.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.725
My guy's
an up-and-comer.

12:18.793 --> 12:20.027
That's why
your guy's pouncing.

12:20.094 --> 12:22.563
Your client
is an impulse shopper,

12:22.630 --> 12:24.231
which is what may have
made him a quick success,

12:24.298 --> 12:26.300
but it could make him
an even faster failure.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.135
So he's
a passionate guy.

12:28.202 --> 12:30.870
He falls in love with a city,
and he builds himself a hotel.

12:30.938 --> 12:33.206
Who are you to argue
with his track record?

12:33.273 --> 12:35.574
I'm a realist,
and I have never seen a deal

12:35.642 --> 12:37.977
pushed through so quickly.
So what?

12:38.044 --> 12:39.779
So your guy
might wake up tomorrow

12:39.846 --> 12:41.614
and decide that he
doesn't wanna do this,

12:41.681 --> 12:43.649
which is why I'm not
showing you our private books

12:43.717 --> 12:45.652
without a signed deal.

12:45.719 --> 12:47.654
- Is that a joke?
- Am I laughing?

12:47.721 --> 12:49.956
Look, I may not have been
awake during our M&A Clinic--

12:50.023 --> 12:51.624
Except for when you
were copying my notes.

12:51.691 --> 12:54.026
Which was no walk in the park.
You write like a monkey.

12:54.093 --> 12:57.429
But in any case,
due diligence is a requirement.

13:01.134 --> 13:04.771
I have an obligation
to my client.

13:04.839 --> 13:07.674
Then we
don't have a deal.

13:07.742 --> 13:10.077
And everyone's gonna know
it's because you killed it.

13:10.145 --> 13:12.046
You know...

13:12.114 --> 13:14.115
I don't see you rushing
to show us <i>your</i> private books.

13:14.183 --> 13:15.883
I have nothing to hide.

13:15.951 --> 13:17.852
You can have full access
to our books right now.

13:17.919 --> 13:20.654
Great. You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.

13:20.722 --> 13:22.656
Don't say it, Harvey.

13:25.259 --> 13:27.160
Mike.

13:27.228 --> 13:29.562
Hey, are you okay?
Now you care?

13:29.630 --> 13:31.064
Mr. Ross,
I'm gonna have to ask you

13:31.132 --> 13:33.032
not to speak to my client.
She's not your client.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.567
She is Rachel
the paralegal.

13:34.635 --> 13:35.935
And I only have
five minutes,

13:36.002 --> 13:37.636
so you should really
get out of my face.

13:37.704 --> 13:39.138
- What's your problem, Mike?
- My problem is that you

13:39.206 --> 13:41.173
don't have the balls
to make this a fair fight, Kyle.

13:41.241 --> 13:42.908
Lawyering
isn't about fighting fair,

13:42.976 --> 13:44.543
and you'd better watch
your false accusations,

13:44.611 --> 13:47.513
or I might just sue you
for defamation.

13:47.581 --> 13:49.415
Come on.

13:52.819 --> 13:54.820
The defendant wishes
to countersue.

13:54.888 --> 13:56.789
- On what grounds?
- I believe that's my line,

13:56.857 --> 13:58.791
counselor.

13:58.859 --> 14:00.526
Defamation of character.

14:00.594 --> 14:01.894
The plaintiff's video
negatively impacted

14:01.962 --> 14:03.596
the perception
of Lena Lunders

14:03.664 --> 14:05.031
and impaired
her financial well-being.

14:05.099 --> 14:06.532
That's ridiculous,
Your Honor.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.201
In order for there
to be defamation,

14:08.268 --> 14:09.936
the statements made
would've had to have been false.

14:10.004 --> 14:11.504
That's not the case here.
Then you should have

14:11.572 --> 14:13.173
no problem proving that
in court.

14:14.675 --> 14:16.810
The countersuit
is allowed.

14:16.878 --> 14:18.612
- Are you serious?
- Would you like

14:18.679 --> 14:22.415
to approach the bench
and find out how serious I am?

14:24.752 --> 14:26.553
Your Honor, the defense
should've filed counterclaims

14:26.621 --> 14:28.622
before the trial began.
Yes, he should have.

14:28.690 --> 14:30.191
But no one
in this crop of associates

14:30.259 --> 14:32.294
had the foresight
to do so.

14:32.361 --> 14:34.830
And we drafted
a whole addendum

14:34.897 --> 14:38.800
just because we assumed
one of you would.

14:38.868 --> 14:40.835
So I'm going
to allow it.

14:40.903 --> 14:42.705
Do you have
a problem with that?

14:42.772 --> 14:44.039
No, Your Honor.

14:44.107 --> 14:46.374
This is now
a defamation trial.

14:46.442 --> 14:48.042
You have until Friday
to prepare.

14:52.781 --> 14:54.982
Nice recovery.
Thinking on your feet.

14:55.050 --> 14:56.717
But you wouldn't
have had to

14:56.785 --> 14:59.353
if you hadn't been
so naive.

14:59.421 --> 15:01.055
Thank you,
Your Honor.

15:05.161 --> 15:07.596
How'd
the negotiation go?

15:07.664 --> 15:09.298
You come out <i>on top?</i>

15:09.365 --> 15:11.834
Why didn't you tell me
Scottie was opposing counsel?

15:11.901 --> 15:14.470
Because I didn't want you
to have performance anxiety.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.272
About the case.
She's tough.

15:16.339 --> 15:17.907
- You're obvious.
- And your fly's unzipped.

15:17.974 --> 15:19.742
- No, it isn't.
- But it was earlier today.

15:19.809 --> 15:21.076
You can do better.

15:21.144 --> 15:22.511
Ooh, is that
what Scottie said?

15:22.578 --> 15:24.246
Type up the deal points.

15:24.313 --> 15:26.748
I got her to cave.
Debeque's gonna run the show.

15:26.816 --> 15:29.117
All I had to do
was show her our books.

15:31.853 --> 15:33.153
I can't believe it.

15:33.221 --> 15:34.654
You gave me, like,
the worst advice

15:34.722 --> 15:36.623
anyone's ever given
another person.

15:36.691 --> 15:38.959
Take the drama
down a notch, Juliet.

15:39.027 --> 15:41.628
I tried to settle,
and I got completely blindsided.

15:41.696 --> 15:44.565
I told you to settle.
I didn't tell you to be stupid.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.200
What do you think's gonna
happen in the real world?

15:46.268 --> 15:47.802
You have to be prepared
for anything.

15:47.869 --> 15:49.070
Well,
in the real world,

15:49.137 --> 15:50.638
I won't have to
be looking for someone

15:50.706 --> 15:52.674
to play my fake witness
in my fake trial.

15:52.742 --> 15:54.009
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you think?

15:54.077 --> 15:55.745
Do you think witnesses
are just gonna jump up

15:55.812 --> 15:57.647
and present themselves?
'Cause they're not.

15:57.714 --> 15:59.615
And sometimes
when you have one,

15:59.683 --> 16:01.317
they disappear
or recant.

16:01.385 --> 16:03.752
And you know what you do?
You deal with it.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.087
Mock trial
is about figuring out

16:05.154 --> 16:06.822
what type of lawyer
you wanna be,

16:06.890 --> 16:09.591
and there's only two types--
winners and losers.

16:09.659 --> 16:11.960
That sounds great, Harvey,
but I haven't prepared.

16:12.028 --> 16:14.630
I don't have anyone to play
my client or my witness,

16:14.698 --> 16:16.132
and apparently
I'm going up against someone

16:16.200 --> 16:17.834
that I can't trust.

16:17.902 --> 16:19.236
Figure out
a way to beat him anyway.

16:19.303 --> 16:20.837
Winners don't make excuses

16:20.905 --> 16:22.839
when the other side
plays the game.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.711
Hey, Donna, I proofed
that final agreement

16:37.779 --> 16:39.580
on the hotel merger.

16:39.648 --> 16:41.883
Quick question--has Harvey
ever heard of spell-check?

16:41.951 --> 16:45.520
Oh, my God.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.323
- Sorry.
- Are you--

16:47.391 --> 16:48.624
No, no, no.
It's okay. Here.

16:48.692 --> 16:50.393
No, no, no.
You don't have to talk.

16:50.461 --> 16:52.429
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

16:52.497 --> 16:53.930
It's okay.
He says things sometimes,

16:53.998 --> 16:55.632
and they--and they
cut to the bone.

16:55.700 --> 16:58.368
He does it to me too.
I know, so...

16:58.436 --> 17:00.503
It's not bad, right?

17:00.571 --> 17:02.506
I can also do
the Demi Moore single tear--

17:02.573 --> 17:04.808
left eye or right eye--if that's
better for the character.

17:04.876 --> 17:06.675
Okay, I'm scared.
What's going on?

17:06.743 --> 17:09.011
If I'm gonna play
Lena Lunders for you,

17:09.079 --> 17:11.914
I need to be able to use
my full range of emotions.

17:11.982 --> 17:14.349
Oh, my God. I love you.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.853
Yeah, I know.

17:16.921 --> 17:18.488
Focus.

17:18.556 --> 17:19.823
You need another witness,
and at this point,

17:19.890 --> 17:21.458
everybody else
in the firm is booked up.

17:21.526 --> 17:23.527
Aw!
Is mommy helping you

17:23.595 --> 17:26.297
clean up your mess, Ross?

17:26.365 --> 17:28.633
Am I mommy
in this scenario?

17:28.701 --> 17:30.769
What? Uh...

17:30.837 --> 17:34.172
Ross is just...
A baby.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.541
So, okay...

17:36.609 --> 17:37.942
Oh, my God.

17:38.010 --> 17:40.311
I cannot believe
I'm gonna lose

17:40.379 --> 17:41.913
to that tool.
Okay, come on.

17:41.981 --> 17:44.515
No pity parties.
Go to an outside source

17:44.583 --> 17:46.283
for the other witness.

17:46.351 --> 17:48.018
For the best friend
you need somebody pretty,

17:48.086 --> 17:50.888
sympathetic,
and most importantly,

17:50.955 --> 17:54.224
willing to go above
and beyond for you.

17:57.495 --> 17:59.363
What are you
doing here?

17:59.431 --> 18:00.898
Jenny, come on,
I need your help.

18:00.966 --> 18:03.701
Got nowhere else to go.

18:11.511 --> 18:13.746
You yelled at me.
Kissed me.

18:13.814 --> 18:15.782
Pushed me away.
Disappeared.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.584
I haven't talked
to you in forever.

18:17.652 --> 18:19.319
I don't even know
what's going on in your life.

18:19.386 --> 18:21.654
Well, if you let me in,
I'll explain,

18:21.722 --> 18:25.057
and I promise
it's a really good story.

18:27.361 --> 18:30.829
So you've been living a lie
this whole time.

18:30.897 --> 18:34.234
Uh...

18:34.301 --> 18:36.236
Yeah.

18:36.303 --> 18:38.105
That's awesome.

18:39.540 --> 18:41.975
- Really?
- Yeah!

18:42.043 --> 18:43.910
I mean, as far
as double lives go,

18:43.978 --> 18:46.279
you're maybe not as cool
as Clark Kent, but still.

18:46.347 --> 18:47.647
- Clark Kent?
- Mm-hmm.

18:47.715 --> 18:50.284
- Okay, you're cut off.
- Mm.

18:50.351 --> 18:51.852
Thank you.

18:53.354 --> 18:55.856
What?
Nothing.

18:55.924 --> 18:59.526
It just feels really good
to tell you.

18:59.594 --> 19:03.296
I don't really have anybody
I can talk to about it.

19:03.364 --> 19:05.398
You trust me.

19:06.834 --> 19:10.303
Yeah.
I guess I do.

19:13.241 --> 19:15.108
I like that.

19:16.711 --> 19:19.146
Ooh, but I really like this.

19:23.918 --> 19:26.620
♪ ♪

19:30.758 --> 19:33.459
Mm.

27:22.235 --> 27:23.968
Hmm.

27:26.605 --> 27:29.406
Sydney Thompson was at a party
and made a joke.

27:29.474 --> 27:30.740
It wasn't meant
to be mean

27:30.808 --> 27:32.843
or to be taken
as fact,

27:32.910 --> 27:35.812

was never meant to be public.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.849

that Sydney Thompson chose

27:38.916 --> 27:41.385
to publicly defame her boss
with an impression

27:41.452 --> 27:43.220
that she knew
would be damaging,

27:43.288 --> 27:46.224
both to Lena Lunders' reputation
and her company.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.327
I call Lena Lunders
to the stand.

27:56.670 --> 28:00.439
Uh...Do you need
a minute?

28:00.507 --> 28:03.408
No.

28:03.476 --> 28:05.644
I can continue.
Thank you.

28:07.781 --> 28:10.716
Please.

28:10.784 --> 28:14.019
I'm a self-made woman.

28:14.087 --> 28:16.021
I created
the global initiative

28:16.089 --> 28:18.590
to target problems
in third-world countries.

28:18.658 --> 28:21.860
I take my work
very seriously,

28:21.927 --> 28:25.297
and if a joke
can be made of that,

28:25.365 --> 28:28.400
fine.

28:28.467 --> 28:31.603
But as a woman in power,
people look at your success

28:31.671 --> 28:33.538
and label you.

28:33.605 --> 28:35.740
They don't know
the complexity it takes

28:35.808 --> 28:37.809
for a woman to succeed
in this business.

28:37.876 --> 28:41.145
And when someone
undermines that,

28:41.213 --> 28:43.948
well...

28:44.016 --> 28:47.719
We have to fight
for ourselves...

28:47.787 --> 28:50.488
Don't we,
Your Honor?

28:50.556 --> 28:51.956
Objection.

28:52.024 --> 28:54.926
So it's hard to be
a woman in business?

28:54.994 --> 28:57.495
That has nothing to do
with the facts of this case.

28:57.563 --> 28:59.931
Well, we can only understand
the damage your client has done

28:59.999 --> 29:02.267
by fully understanding
the care with which Miss Lunders

29:02.335 --> 29:04.603
has built her reputation.

29:06.773 --> 29:08.773
Um, I'm sorry.

29:08.841 --> 29:12.144
Can you ask me the question
one more time?

29:13.413 --> 29:15.247
Take a deep breath.

29:16.783 --> 29:19.051
It's just you and me.

29:19.118 --> 29:21.086
We're just gonna have
a conversation about your job,

29:21.154 --> 29:24.056
okay?
Yeah, okay.

29:24.123 --> 29:26.458
How do you know
the defendant Sydney Thompson?

29:26.525 --> 29:29.561
We were coworkers.
We started at the same level,

29:29.629 --> 29:31.964
and then I was promoted
to be her immediate superior.

29:32.032 --> 29:33.833
And do you know
about the video in question?

29:33.901 --> 29:35.534
Yes. I was at
the party that night.

29:35.602 --> 29:37.603
And what were you
celebrating that night?

29:37.671 --> 29:39.338
My promotion.

29:39.406 --> 29:42.341
Same night.
That's interesting.

29:42.409 --> 29:44.543
Miss Ginnesse.

29:44.611 --> 29:46.112
What did you think
of the impersonation?

29:46.179 --> 29:49.815
It was too far.
It was mean.

29:49.883 --> 29:52.517
So why do you think
Miss Thompson did it?

29:52.585 --> 29:55.053
Miss Lunders promoted me.
Sydney hated it.

29:55.121 --> 29:57.155
And that's why
she made the video.

29:58.592 --> 30:00.426
Well, thank you,
Miss Ginnesse.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.395
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

30:03.731 --> 30:05.699
Did Sydney ever tell you

30:05.767 --> 30:07.568
that she hated
your promotion?

30:07.636 --> 30:10.471
- Not exactly.
- Yes or no, please.

30:10.539 --> 30:12.406
- No.
- Well, then how do you know

30:12.474 --> 30:14.608
that she hated
your promotion?

30:14.676 --> 30:16.544
I could just tell.

30:16.611 --> 30:18.078
Can you tell what
I'm thinking right now?

30:18.146 --> 30:19.780
That you're wishing
I would agree

30:19.848 --> 30:22.549
with everything you say?
No. I was thinking

30:22.617 --> 30:24.051
that if you could
actually read my mind,

30:24.119 --> 30:25.519
I wouldn't bother
asking you the questions.

30:25.587 --> 30:26.887
But you can't read my mind,
can you?

30:26.955 --> 30:28.889
No, I'm--I'm
managing director--

30:28.957 --> 30:31.524
No. And I'm pretty sure
you can't read Sydney's either.

30:31.592 --> 30:34.861
And you actually have no idea
<i>why</i> she made that video.

30:34.929 --> 30:37.731
Correct?

30:37.799 --> 30:41.034
I guess I don't. No.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.609
Good afternoon,
Miss Scott.

30:47.677 --> 30:50.446
Thank you.

30:52.115 --> 30:54.283
Are you here to give me
a proper send-off?

30:54.351 --> 30:56.585
I don't think we can do that
out here on the street.

30:56.653 --> 30:58.420
- You sure?
- You tricked me.

30:58.488 --> 30:59.988
I'm impressed.

31:00.056 --> 31:02.925
To be fair,
Vega did want a merger.

31:02.993 --> 31:04.760
I just convinced him that,

31:04.828 --> 31:06.762
given your client's propensity
for rash purchases,

31:06.830 --> 31:09.465
that allowing him to
stay in charge was a bad idea.

31:09.533 --> 31:11.567
Vega needed Debeque's hotels
minus Debeque,

31:11.635 --> 31:13.302
and I found a way.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.304
One that he never
asked for or wanted,

31:15.372 --> 31:18.107
and one that
he's never gonna get.

31:20.344 --> 31:22.645
Was--is this for real?

31:22.713 --> 31:24.413
Three of Debeque's properties.
It'll be on the market

31:24.481 --> 31:25.915
by the end of day.
He's never gonna let you

31:25.983 --> 31:27.583
sell off
his crown jewels.

31:27.651 --> 31:29.385
See, that's the thing
about passionate clients.

31:29.453 --> 31:31.053
When they're crossed,
they get angry,

31:31.121 --> 31:32.688
and they'll do anything
to get back.

31:35.459 --> 31:36.960
Don't do this, Harvey.

31:37.028 --> 31:39.062
Look, there's another way
we can do this.

31:39.129 --> 31:41.598
We can get our clients
into a room together,

31:41.665 --> 31:43.532
you can tell them
you were wrong,

31:43.600 --> 31:46.336
and we can convince them
back into a merger.

31:48.338 --> 31:50.940
Miss Thompson,
what was the intent

31:51.008 --> 31:52.508
behind
your impersonation?

31:52.576 --> 31:53.976
I was just trying
to be funny.

31:54.044 --> 31:55.678
Everyone in our office
makes jokes,

31:55.745 --> 31:57.246
and as a matter of fact,

31:57.314 --> 31:59.248
Ms. Lunders encourages us
to be informal.

31:59.316 --> 32:01.684
I can't win this
just on facts.

32:01.751 --> 32:03.518
- ...Passed over for promotion.
- But I expected it.

32:03.586 --> 32:07.189
I think everyone
has the impulse to move up,

32:07.256 --> 32:08.857
but at a certain point,
you just have to let it go.

32:08.925 --> 32:10.425
So that's what I did.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.927
What are you gonna do?

32:11.994 --> 32:13.562
I've never held
ill will for my boss.

32:13.629 --> 32:17.733
I'm gonna play the woman,
not the case.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.401
You say you expected
to be passed over

32:19.469 --> 32:21.103
for a promotion, correct?
Yes.

32:21.171 --> 32:23.405
And yet you applied
three times?

32:23.473 --> 32:25.540
- Yes.
- And you were never promoted?

32:25.608 --> 32:27.709
As I said, yes.

32:27.777 --> 32:29.444
And when Nora Ginnesse
was promoted,

32:29.512 --> 32:31.547
you wrote scathing emails
to the rest

32:31.615 --> 32:33.449
of your coworkers in response.
No, not scathing.

32:33.517 --> 32:35.151
The intent
was to be funny.

32:35.218 --> 32:36.552
Oh, right,
you like to be funny.

32:36.619 --> 32:37.920
Who doesn't like
to laugh?

32:37.987 --> 32:39.621
Someone whose reputation
has been ruined.

32:39.689 --> 32:40.922
- Objection.
- Just a thought.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.791
- It's testifying.
- Sustained.

32:42.859 --> 32:45.193
Mr. Ross, questions.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

32:45.261 --> 32:47.295
Forgive me. I was just
trying to be funny.

32:47.363 --> 32:50.531
On your performance review,
Lena Lunders wrote,

32:50.599 --> 32:53.701
"Good work ethic.
Lacks skills."

32:53.769 --> 32:55.536
Do you think
that's a fair assessment?

32:55.604 --> 32:57.271
Fair?
I--I don't know.

32:57.339 --> 32:59.340
Well, your coworkers
were promoted,

32:59.408 --> 33:02.310
and your boss
was calling you mediocre.

33:02.378 --> 33:05.714
- Are you mediocre?
- No.

33:05.782 --> 33:07.583
So why haven't you
been promoted?

33:07.650 --> 33:08.918
I don't know.

33:08.985 --> 33:10.653
Do you think
you deserve better?

33:10.720 --> 33:12.622
- Doesn't everyone?
- So why haven't you tried?

33:12.689 --> 33:14.790
- I <i>have</i> tried.
- Why haven't you improved?

33:14.858 --> 33:16.425
I didn't say
I haven't improved.

33:16.493 --> 33:17.960
Well, your review did.

33:18.027 --> 33:20.695
Your five years
without a promotion did.

33:20.763 --> 33:23.565
Look, you were so angry
that you weren't moving forward

33:23.632 --> 33:25.400
that you lashed out
at your boss--

33:25.468 --> 33:26.768
- No.
- Objection! Testifying!

33:26.836 --> 33:28.769
- Everyone was moving past you.
- So what?

33:28.837 --> 33:30.171
- People making good on their--
- Badgering, Your Honor.

33:30.238 --> 33:31.739
- Sustained.
- People who could cut it.

33:31.806 --> 33:34.141
I <i>can</i> cut it!

33:47.857 --> 33:48.958
Excuse me,
Your Honor.

33:50.994 --> 33:52.895
Settlement's
still on the table.

33:52.963 --> 33:55.064
- What?
- Let's settle. Same deal.

33:55.132 --> 33:57.134
Win-win.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.471
- No, I'm good.
- Excuse me?

34:01.539 --> 34:02.806
I've seen
the moony looks, Ross.

34:02.873 --> 34:04.808
You like her, so you're
offering me a settlement

34:04.876 --> 34:07.844
because you don't want
to hurt her feelings.

34:07.912 --> 34:11.081
But I'd rather see
if you'll break her.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.016
Giddy-up, cowboy.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.786
Counselor.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.822
Would you like
to proceed?

34:25.498 --> 34:28.434
No, Your Honor.

34:28.502 --> 34:31.570
- Are you sure?
- Yes, Your Honor.

34:31.638 --> 34:33.373
Nothing further.

34:38.478 --> 34:43.149
Well, normally we'd move on
to closing statements,

34:43.217 --> 34:46.452
but it's been a long week,
and honestly,

34:46.518 --> 34:48.286
we all know
where this is going.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.856
So court rules in favor
of the defendant.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.257
This court is adjourned.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.731
Mr. Ross.

35:08.908 --> 35:11.944
Naive and soft.

35:12.012 --> 35:14.813
Not qualities we're looking for
at Pearson Hardman.

35:39.529 --> 35:42.631
Gentlemen, I appreciate you
leaving the swords at home.

35:42.699 --> 35:44.467
What started off
as a true merger

35:44.534 --> 35:46.402
never needed to become
anything different.

35:46.469 --> 35:48.103
Daniel, I want you
to listen to me.

35:48.171 --> 35:50.305
I know Harvey, and he just
wants to merge your businesses

35:50.373 --> 35:51.874
so he can double
his billable hours.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.044
Quiet, Scott.
I wanna hear what he has to say.

35:55.112 --> 35:58.581
I'm just here to get my client
the deal that he wants,

35:58.649 --> 36:00.884
and what he wants is a merger,
is that right, Jones?

36:00.952 --> 36:03.888
- That's right.
- Daniel.

36:03.956 --> 36:06.324
Your law firm overreached
in a situation

36:06.392 --> 36:07.892
where it wasn't necessary.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.828
It's not entirely
Scottie's fault.

36:09.896 --> 36:11.797
We lawyers all have
an instinct to win,

36:11.865 --> 36:14.099
but sometimes we may not fully
understand what that means.

36:14.167 --> 36:15.734
We understand
what it means.

36:15.802 --> 36:17.569
Well, maybe you do,
and maybe you don't.

36:17.637 --> 36:20.639
For me, it would be
to see both men

36:20.707 --> 36:22.374
return
to the initial deal

36:22.442 --> 36:25.044
so that you can grow
both your businesses,

36:25.111 --> 36:28.347
instead of having one company
with a hostile reputation

36:28.415 --> 36:30.048
and the other a shell
of what it once was.

36:30.116 --> 36:33.452
I mean, that doesn't sound
like a win to me.

36:39.594 --> 36:41.795
I'm sorry.

36:41.862 --> 36:44.431
Let's just go back
to the original deal.

36:48.402 --> 36:51.137
We can run it
together.

37:01.248 --> 37:02.982

You know what? You can save
the disappointment, Harvey.

37:14.094 --> 37:15.961
I know what I did.
Do you?

37:16.029 --> 37:17.497
Because what I saw
is that you backed off

37:17.564 --> 37:19.232
because you were
worried about hurting

37:19.299 --> 37:22.102
your girlfriend's feelings.
It was a fake trial.

37:22.169 --> 37:24.103
All right? I weighed
the pros and the cons,

37:24.171 --> 37:26.639
and I decided it wasn't worth
hurting someone for the result.

37:26.707 --> 37:29.643
The result is you just told
every partner in this firm,

37:29.711 --> 37:32.078
including myself,
that you have a weak stomach,

37:32.146 --> 37:34.014
that you don't have
what it takes.

37:40.354 --> 37:41.721

And if I were smart,
I'd probably be just like you,
