00:04.091 --> 00:06.994
- Action!
- I actually was accepted

00:07.028 --> 00:08.896
to Wash U a couple months ago.

00:08.930 --> 00:12.032
I was actually
wondering if, um...

00:12.067 --> 00:13.734
I could still get my spot.

00:13.768 --> 00:16.837
The Bill Kennish no-bull straight talk.
Well, thank you.

00:16.871 --> 00:20.607
- You turned out all right. - What I've
done, I've done in spite of you.

00:20.642 --> 00:24.545
My dad parked at the mall and some
guy walked up to him and shot him.

00:24.579 --> 00:27.481
- I'm in love with you.
- You're gonna find someone

00:27.515 --> 00:29.450
so much better for you than me.

Jace: <i>Coto needs</i>

00:30.685 --> 00:33.153
What if we send him
an anonymous message

00:33.188 --> 00:35.522
- telling him that we know what he did?
- Do it.

- Oh, hey guys.
- MB! What's up?

00:48.369 --> 00:50.270
( Sighs ) Just putting
the sharks to bed.

00:50.305 --> 00:53.140
Actually, the sharks might
be put down permanently.

00:53.174 --> 00:55.842
Mac told me we're closing
the parks on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

00:55.877 --> 00:57.878
- Really? Why?
- Not enough business.

00:57.912 --> 00:59.079
I guess that new
water park's killing us.

00:59.113 --> 01:01.715
- That sucks.
- Oh man, I love this job.

01:01.749 --> 01:03.917
- I know, me too.
- Well, isn't there something we can do?

01:03.951 --> 01:07.688

or singles day?

I think I got it.

01:18.566 --> 01:21.468

that magic toolbox on Maui.

01:21.502 --> 01:23.303

You're familiar
with diplomatic immunity?

02:45.286 --> 02:47.287
I'm with the British consulate

02:47.321 --> 02:50.190
and while in this country,
as I'm sure you know,

02:50.224 --> 02:52.058
I'm immune from prosecution.

02:53.094 --> 02:54.161
You gotta be kidding me.

02:54.195 --> 02:55.362
I assure you I'm not.

02:55.396 --> 02:57.230
Call the consulate if you like.

02:59.066 --> 03:00.867
Is this car yours or hers?

03:00.902 --> 03:02.836
Hers, but as long as I'm in it,

03:02.870 --> 03:05.705
the car is considered
sovereign British soil.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.675
Therefore, my deaf cousin here

03:08.709 --> 03:12.679
enjoys the same immunities
from prosecution.

It's the accent.
It freaks you people out.

03:26.694 --> 03:29.429
Did you tell him I was your cousin?
That's gross!

at Wash U.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.197
You're reading
our kids' mail now?

04:04.232 --> 04:06.967
I was cleaning his studio.

Isn't it great news?

"Regarding your recent inquiry.

We are happy to inform you"--

04:11.372 --> 04:13.206
Wow. He must've
called 'em.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.075
Does this mean he's
getting second thoughts

04:15.109 --> 04:18.178
about the wedding or does
he wanna do college too?

04:18.212 --> 04:20.413
- We could ask him.
- Absolutely not.

04:20.447 --> 04:22.315
This is delicate territory.

04:22.350 --> 04:25.285
- If we press him-- - "If you would like
to include any additional materials

we would..." bup bup bup.

04:28.022 --> 04:30.423
Oh. Waiting list is packed.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.226
Well, he already
got in once and...

04:33.261 --> 04:36.429
Maybe we could ask
your dad to make a call.

04:38.432 --> 04:42.135
- No.
- John, this is for Toby.

04:42.169 --> 04:44.237
Why would we do that?

04:44.272 --> 04:46.206
When we know exactly
how that would turn out--

04:46.240 --> 04:48.008
with one of us
getting insulted.

04:48.042 --> 04:50.010
So what?
It's worth a shot.

04:50.044 --> 04:53.246
Forget it, Kathryn.
I am not asking my father for a favor.

04:53.281 --> 04:55.348
Well, then I'll ask him.

04:55.383 --> 04:58.184
It won't be a favor for you.
It'll be a favor for me.

05:00.221 --> 05:02.923
Fine, you ask.

is supposed to be

05:11.165 --> 05:12.966

going to be full of hate.

05:18.072 --> 05:19.272
Maybe you don't have to be.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.076

05:23.110 --> 05:25.278
You mean see him in prison?

05:25.313 --> 05:27.280
Look him in the eye

05:27.315 --> 05:29.382
and show him what
he has taken from you.

05:29.417 --> 05:32.385
I don't know if I can do that.

05:34.121 --> 05:37.057

at our wedding.

05:37.091 --> 05:39.292
If you think facing him
will help at all,

05:39.327 --> 05:41.261
then I think we should.

05:47.034 --> 05:48.134
- "Motto"?

05:48.169 --> 05:50.337
- I thought you said
it begins with "C."

05:50.371 --> 05:53.940
Hey! How goes
the business of the state?

05:53.975 --> 05:57.010
What's a five-letter word
for "statement of beliefs"?

I can see I'm <i>not</i>
<i>interrupting anything.</i>

05:59.046 --> 06:01.014

on something?

06:01.048 --> 06:02.215

06:02.249 --> 06:03.883
Okay, well, you know

06:03.918 --> 06:04.985
that new water park,

06:05.019 --> 06:06.152
Poseidon's Cove.

06:06.187 --> 06:08.254
Oh, right.
That place looks incredible.

Yeah, well, it's kind of
drowning Maui, Kansas.

06:10.324 --> 06:12.892

it looked amazing.

Go on.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.101
Okay, well, I've been
trying to think

06:21.135 --> 06:23.903
of different theme days

06:23.938 --> 06:25.271
to bring in more business.

06:25.306 --> 06:29.075
And I was thinking
what about "Deaf Day"?

06:29.110 --> 06:31.044
Is that offensive or awesome?

06:31.078 --> 06:34.114
- Definitely awesome!
- That's what I was hoping you'd say.

06:34.148 --> 06:38.184
So can you help me think of different
places that I could reach out to?

06:38.219 --> 06:40.186
I mean Carlton obviously,
but where else?

06:40.221 --> 06:42.188
Well, there's a bunch
of message boards.

06:42.223 --> 06:44.090
- I can do that.
- Oh great.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.259
So what should we do?

06:46.293 --> 06:49.863
Oh! You should show
"Deafenstein"!

06:49.897 --> 06:51.931
We did it once for a
fundraiser for Carlton.

06:51.966 --> 06:54.901
I swear every deaf person
in KC came.

06:54.935 --> 06:56.870
I knew you were
the person to ask.

06:56.904 --> 07:00.173
( Laughs ) We can ask Emmett.
He set it up.

07:00.207 --> 07:01.741
By the way,

07:01.776 --> 07:04.844
credo,
"statement of belief."

07:04.879 --> 07:07.013
As in
"by any means necessary."

07:09.817 --> 07:11.618
Ta.

07:11.652 --> 07:13.687
That guy's like
a one-man revolution.

07:13.721 --> 07:16.623
Okay, so I can get
everything going with Emmett,

07:16.657 --> 07:18.792
but I just need to know what day
you were thinking of.

07:18.826 --> 07:21.394
That's okay.
I can ask him.

07:21.429 --> 07:24.597
Oh. You two are...

07:24.632 --> 07:28.201
( Scoffs )
Please, that's ancient history.

07:28.235 --> 07:29.602
So he's okay with you and Ty?

07:31.138 --> 07:33.173
I actually haven't
mentioned that.

07:33.207 --> 07:34.474
( Laughs nervously )

07:34.508 --> 07:37.177
Okay, it's not like
we report to each other

07:37.211 --> 07:38.378
on who we're dating.

07:40.347 --> 07:42.215
( Sighs )
Yeah, okay.

07:47.788 --> 07:49.122
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:49.156 --> 07:51.958
I am actually here
on official business.

07:51.992 --> 07:53.793
I've been thinking
about redoing the carwash.

07:53.828 --> 07:57.731
( Laughs )
Maybe some paisley sponges

07:57.765 --> 08:00.500
or some mid-century
modern towels?

08:00.534 --> 08:02.368
Ha ha, very funny.
You think I'm kidding,

08:02.403 --> 08:03.737
but I'm talking about my office

08:03.771 --> 08:05.338

08:05.372 --> 08:06.573
I think you would be perfect.

08:07.641 --> 08:09.442
I'd love to.

08:09.477 --> 08:11.277
But full disclosure--

08:11.312 --> 08:13.246
my experience is
still kinda limited.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.415
Regina, I saw what you did
with the guesthouse.

08:15.449 --> 08:17.150
I know I'm in good hands.

08:17.184 --> 08:20.019
John, you don't have
to do this.

08:20.054 --> 08:21.387
I want to.

08:21.422 --> 08:23.256
So I'll let Toby know
that you'll be in touch,

08:23.290 --> 08:25.291

08:25.326 --> 08:28.094

10:34.922 --> 10:36.790
Nikki's got a lot more
to worry about right now

10:36.824 --> 10:38.625
than me talking
to my ex-girlfriend.

10:38.659 --> 10:40.894
They found the guy
that killed her father.

10:40.928 --> 10:43.763
- Really?
- He's already in prison.

10:43.798 --> 10:45.765
I guess he wants to...

10:45.800 --> 10:48.535
clear his conscience of all
the other things he's done.

10:48.536 --> 10:50.460
We're actually going
to go see him.

10:50.461 --> 10:51.461
Is that a good idea?

10:51.462 --> 10:54.207
She's so angry.
We gotta try something.

10:54.241 --> 10:56.443
We just need someone
who's over 21 to take us.

10:56.477 --> 10:59.012
- Prison rules.
- Nikki's mom?

10:59.046 --> 11:01.081
Well, she doesn't want
anything to do with the guy.

11:01.115 --> 11:04.084
And can you imagine
me asking my parents?

11:04.118 --> 11:05.952
We need someone else.

11:05.987 --> 11:07.988
( Sighs )

11:09.223 --> 11:12.826
So you thought you'd ask
the recovering alcoholic

11:12.860 --> 11:14.728
with the criminal record
and the sham marriage?

11:15.763 --> 11:17.030
Will you at least
think about it?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.701
I will think about it.

11:21.736 --> 11:23.503
Thanks.

11:50.097 --> 11:53.066
Bay, can we let the customers buy some
food and play some games, please?

11:53.100 --> 11:54.234
Welcome to Maui!

Oh, thank God.
Mac was threatening

12:50.257 --> 12:53.827
to show some vampire thing
if you didn't make it.

12:53.861 --> 12:55.829
"Taste The Blood Of Dracula"
has universal appeal.

12:55.863 --> 12:57.864
Trust me, you're not
getting between deaf people

13:18.285 --> 13:21.221
( Chuckles )
Uh, here.

13:21.255 --> 13:24.357
I've never seen "Deafenstein,"
but I'm pretty sure

13:24.391 --> 13:26.993
it doesn't have
a girl-on-girl scene.

13:27.027 --> 13:28.962
Whoa. Seriously, guys?

13:28.996 --> 13:30.163
This is a family park.

13:31.198 --> 13:33.867
How do they do that
in costumes?

_

13:39.284 --> 13:45.349
_

13:45.880 --> 13:47.647
A lot of people are coming.

13:47.681 --> 13:49.716
Then we have to
show 'em something.

13:49.750 --> 13:53.386
Okay, what about the DVD?
We could just project that.

13:53.387 --> 13:55.915
_

13:58.392 --> 13:59.592
Could do a midnight showing.

13:59.627 --> 14:01.461
- ( Scoffs )
- What?

14:01.495 --> 14:03.363
Two things
your government gets right--

14:03.397 --> 14:05.398
national parks
and historic landmarks,

14:05.432 --> 14:07.367
which is an excellent idea.

14:09.236 --> 14:11.104
Daphne:
Another project?

14:11.138 --> 14:13.940
Visit all the national parks.

14:13.974 --> 14:15.275
- You interested?
- Sure.

14:17.111 --> 14:19.946
- Jace. Hi!
- Hey.

14:19.980 --> 14:24.851
Daphne, this is Carrie Breisler,
my scone dealer...

14:24.885 --> 14:27.787
( All laugh ) ...and maker of
this most excellent eclair.

14:27.822 --> 14:30.857
The pastry cream is <i>amazing.</i>

14:30.891 --> 14:32.492
Thank you.
You know what?

14:32.526 --> 14:33.860
It was so much better
when I was in Paris,

14:33.894 --> 14:36.462
but that's probably
just because I was in Paris.

14:36.497 --> 14:39.532
- You baked in France?
- Yeah yeah, just for a year.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.234
I would've loved
to have stayed longer,

14:41.268 --> 14:43.369
but I had to get back
and see my fiancee.

14:43.404 --> 14:46.039
- You're engaged?
- Yeah, new development.

14:46.073 --> 14:47.207
We're about
to go ring shopping.

Oh, speak of the devil.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.152
Jeff, this is Jace,

15:00.955 --> 15:02.922
( Laughs )
And this is Daphne.

15:05.893 --> 15:08.761
- Hello.
- We know each other.

15:08.796 --> 15:11.497
Yeah, Daphne worked
in my kitchen.

15:11.532 --> 15:13.600
Oh really?
Wow, that's crazy.

15:13.634 --> 15:14.834
What a small world.

15:14.835 --> 15:16.335
_

15:16.437 --> 15:18.738
Oh, uh, it's nice to...

15:20.341 --> 15:21.507
- <i>meet you.</i>
<i>- You too.</i>

15:22.676 --> 15:25.211
I'm sorry,
I just thought you were--

15:25.246 --> 15:26.512
No, not deaf.

15:26.547 --> 15:29.315
Just working with a deaf
person, learned to sign.

15:30.384 --> 15:32.118
So when did you work with Jeff?

15:32.152 --> 15:34.354
Last year, but it was
only for a little bit.

15:34.388 --> 15:36.289
- Oh.
- Not long enough for me

15:36.323 --> 15:38.291
to remember
any signing, apparently.

15:38.325 --> 15:40.927
You know what? You guys
should come by Maize tonight,

15:40.961 --> 15:42.195
- have a meal.
- ( Deep inhale )

15:42.229 --> 15:46.799
Maybe, but we have to go, so...

15:46.834 --> 15:48.635
Congratulations again.

15:48.669 --> 15:50.870
Oh. I went public.

15:50.905 --> 15:53.506
I know we don't have
the rings or anything yet,

15:53.540 --> 15:55.541
but come on,
you made me wait four years.

15:55.576 --> 15:57.577
Wait, you've been together
for four years?

15:57.611 --> 15:59.512
Well, part of the time
you were in France.

15:59.546 --> 16:01.581
It wasn't exactly... four.

16:01.615 --> 16:03.249
Where are you working now?

16:03.284 --> 16:05.385
At the State Senate,

16:05.419 --> 16:06.419
interning for my dad.

16:06.453 --> 16:09.389
( Deep inhale )
Anyway, we should be off.

16:09.423 --> 16:11.124
We're headed to Maui, Kansas.

16:11.158 --> 16:13.026
Oh cool!
I love that place.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.260
Are they still doing
those pineapple skewers?

16:14.295 --> 16:17.196
- Why don't you come by?
- ( Hits )

16:17.231 --> 16:19.198
Maybe.
Maybe we will.

16:19.233 --> 16:22.802
- Yeah.
- Well, anyway, you guys have fun.

16:22.836 --> 16:23.770
You too.

16:26.073 --> 16:28.975
- So nice to meet you.
- You too.

16:31.679 --> 16:33.613
Uh, take care.

so all is well.

- Is it not weird for you?
- No.

I mean, a little, yeah,
but it's fine.

18:10.301 --> 18:14.904
You didn't know that Carrie
was engaged to Jeff, right?

18:14.939 --> 18:16.873
That's not why
you brought me there?

18:16.907 --> 18:18.975
Of course not.

18:19.009 --> 18:22.145
No, I'm not sadistic.
You said you wanted dessert.

18:22.179 --> 18:24.113
( Sighs ) Right.

Come on. Let's go play
some tiki-tac-toe.

18:29.820 --> 18:31.521

18:31.555 --> 18:34.657

18:41.599 --> 18:43.466
Okay, so you're
just gonna walk away?

18:43.500 --> 18:45.268
- You're not even gonna say anything?
- What do you want me to say?

18:45.302 --> 18:47.237
It is just a movie.

18:47.271 --> 18:49.539
Look, are you playing me

18:49.573 --> 18:51.407
to make him jealous
or him to make me jealous?

18:51.442 --> 18:55.411
- Just so I'm clear. - There is nothing
going on with me and Emmett.

18:55.446 --> 18:57.380

- I'll see you around.

you want cheap?

- You cannot have both, okay?
- <i>( Door closes )</i>

19:06.924 --> 19:09.092

19:14.064 --> 19:15.698
Well, go on.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.501
Tell me.

Oh God, no.

Oh. No, John's fine.

19:23.407 --> 19:25.475
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

19:26.644 --> 19:28.244
Well, you know, I--

19:28.279 --> 19:29.679
I read about
the heart attack and I--

19:29.713 --> 19:32.415
Oh, he's okay.
He's-- he's been resting.

19:32.449 --> 19:34.450
- ( Chuckles )
- Yeah, sure. Like hell he is.

19:34.485 --> 19:37.387
- ( Both laugh )
- Well, we're doing our best to make sure

19:37.421 --> 19:40.189
- he doesn't overdo it.
- Ah.

19:40.224 --> 19:43.059
Actually, I'm here
to talk to you about Toby.

19:43.093 --> 19:44.327
Thank you.

19:44.361 --> 19:46.329
He got into Wash U.

19:46.363 --> 19:48.965
- Did he?
- Mm-hmm.

19:48.999 --> 19:52.135
- Well, good for him.
- And he decided he didn't want to go,

19:52.169 --> 19:54.737
then he changed his mind,
so he's on the wait list.

19:54.772 --> 19:56.005
- And umm...
- ( Sighs )

19:56.040 --> 19:58.007
I was wondering if you could
do me a favor and make a call.

19:58.042 --> 20:00.576
It sounds like he doesn't
know what he wants.

20:00.611 --> 20:04.447
Then it's our job to help
him figure it out, right?

20:04.481 --> 20:07.550
Well, I--
I'll see what I can do.

20:09.453 --> 20:10.653
Thank you, Bill.

20:11.689 --> 20:12.689
I appreciate it.

20:14.358 --> 20:15.458
I hope you're doing well.

20:15.492 --> 20:17.193
Yeah.

20:18.329 --> 20:20.330
Well, I assume
that I'm gonna get

20:20.364 --> 20:22.298
a thank you
or something from John.

20:24.201 --> 20:25.501
( Exhales deeply )

20:29.239 --> 20:32.075
( Chuckles )
I suppose not.

20:33.143 --> 20:37.714
Do you know he never even
picked up the phone

20:37.748 --> 20:41.017
when Loretta passed?
Not a note. Nothing.

20:42.586 --> 20:45.588
And you invited her
to our wedding

20:45.622 --> 20:46.923
when he specifically
asked you not to.

20:48.459 --> 20:50.626
And he was in the majors
for three years

20:50.661 --> 20:52.595
before you even
congratulated him.

20:52.629 --> 20:55.631
And on and on and on.

20:55.666 --> 20:59.168
You both hold
so tightly to your anger.

21:00.170 --> 21:02.472
I wish you would
just let it go--

21:02.506 --> 21:05.074
both of you--

21:06.110 --> 21:07.377
before it's too late.

21:08.379 --> 21:10.246
Jace:
Where are you taking me?

21:10.280 --> 21:12.048
Just go with it.

21:12.082 --> 21:13.983
- ( Chuckles )
- Oh.

21:13.984 --> 21:16.004
_

21:16.086 --> 21:18.121
Wow. Really wish I knew
it was Helen Keller Day.

21:18.155 --> 21:19.822
Oh, you're in luck.

21:19.857 --> 21:21.124
Next Wednesday is
Ignorant Bigot Day.

21:21.158 --> 21:23.726

I thought you were deaf.

21:23.761 --> 21:25.661

would've made it okay?

21:33.037 --> 21:34.670

21:34.705 --> 21:36.506
Dude. Hello.

21:37.541 --> 21:38.674
Game over.

21:41.445 --> 21:44.414
It's not broken.
You just didn't hit anything,

21:44.448 --> 21:46.449
which is probably
because you're wasted.

21:46.483 --> 21:48.418
Which, by the way,
is not a turn-on,

21:48.452 --> 21:50.353
in case you were wondering.

21:51.909 --> 21:56.101
_

21:57.061 --> 21:58.995
I'm sorry,
I didn't totally get that,

( Chuckles )

24:07.391 --> 24:10.359
I think he feels really bad

24:10.394 --> 24:12.428
about what he said
about deaf people.

24:12.462 --> 24:15.097
Oh yeah yeah,
he is wracked with guilt.

24:15.132 --> 24:18.067
And the only way to make
it better is with a...

24:19.236 --> 24:23.105
$47 donation
to Carlton School for the deaf.

24:23.140 --> 24:26.943
He is far more remorseful
than that.

24:26.977 --> 24:29.011
He's feeling the need to donate

24:29.046 --> 24:31.814
to a few more worthy causes.

24:32.816 --> 24:34.684
Pfft! We can't do that.

24:34.718 --> 24:36.352
Why not?

24:36.386 --> 24:39.488
- Jace.
- Insurance will reimburse him.

24:39.523 --> 24:40.690
It's a victimless crime.

24:40.724 --> 24:43.526
A few more trees
get planted in the world.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.627
Everyone wins.

24:46.230 --> 24:47.263
Jace, we're not doing that.

24:48.465 --> 24:50.266
All right.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.400
All right.

( Toby breathing hard )

25:41.285 --> 25:43.753
That girl?

25:44.955 --> 25:46.922
That girl is the daughter

25:46.957 --> 25:49.558
of the man that you killed.

25:50.594 --> 25:52.595
She can't even look at you.

25:54.798 --> 25:57.366
I cast my burdens on the Lord.

25:57.401 --> 25:59.335
I pray that he can comfort her.

25:59.369 --> 26:01.370
Right, you found God,

26:01.405 --> 26:03.472
so then that
gives you the excuse

26:03.507 --> 26:05.574
to kill an innocent man
who just happened to be

26:05.609 --> 26:07.410
at the wrong place
at the wrong time?

26:08.512 --> 26:11.047
I wish he had just
given me the stuff.

26:11.081 --> 26:14.283
- What stuff?
- I didn't have any cash.

26:14.318 --> 26:16.152
I thought if I took a gun,

26:16.186 --> 26:18.220
maybe I could scare
some hits out of him.

26:18.255 --> 26:20.856
And why would
he have drugs on him?

26:20.891 --> 26:23.726
He's the guy
I bought 'em off of.

26:24.895 --> 26:27.029
- George Papagus?
- Yeah.

26:28.632 --> 26:31.600
- Was your drug dealer?
- Yeah.

26:33.637 --> 26:35.571
But he didn't scare
when I showed him the gun...

26:35.605 --> 26:38.274
( Sighs )

26:38.308 --> 26:39.508
so I shot him.

26:40.544 --> 26:43.112
Then I took the drugs
and I ran.

26:45.315 --> 26:47.149
I'm sorry.

- No. I'm sorry.

27:09.114 --> 27:11.015
This was a bad idea.

27:11.050 --> 27:13.251
( Sighs ) What were
you doing in there?

27:14.353 --> 27:15.887
Talking to him.

27:16.922 --> 27:17.989
What did you say?

27:19.191 --> 27:21.192
Just what she would've said,

27:21.227 --> 27:24.762
that he's where he should be.

27:24.797 --> 27:26.631
And what did he say?

27:27.967 --> 27:29.834
He said...

27:30.970 --> 27:32.470
he was sorry.

27:38.577 --> 27:40.545
I don't wanna think
about this anymore.

Hey. It's Bay, right?

27:58.397 --> 28:00.198
It's all right.
She's with me.

28:02.401 --> 28:04.202
I haven't been
able to reach Ty.

28:04.236 --> 28:07.071
He's not answering his phone
and he's not at the barracks.

28:07.106 --> 28:08.206
He's probably
at the motor pool.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.874
That's usually
where he hides out.

28:09.909 --> 28:11.242
So he told you.

28:11.277 --> 28:13.111
We all heard.
It's the whole unit.

28:13.145 --> 28:16.047
- What's the whole unit?
- The redeployment.

28:17.683 --> 28:18.850
That's what
you meant, isn't it?

28:20.019 --> 28:21.920
Oh man.

28:21.954 --> 28:23.655
I'm always running my mouth.

28:23.689 --> 28:24.889
What redeployment?

28:24.924 --> 28:27.492
Back to Afghanistan,
end of the month.

28:27.526 --> 28:29.527
They're sending a few of us back
to train the new police.

the fact that you're leaving

it was like I crawled out of this hole.

31:42.521 --> 31:44.555

31:44.590 --> 31:46.457
I don't know--
if I don't tell you,

31:46.492 --> 31:49.427
I can pretend I don't have to go
back in that hole for a little longer.

31:49.461 --> 31:51.729
That's great for you,

31:51.763 --> 31:53.631
but what about me?

were you just gonna spring this on me

like last time?

31:58.504 --> 32:02.173
- No. - Do you have any idea
how devastated I was?

32:02.207 --> 32:04.208
Not so devastated

32:04.243 --> 32:06.010
that you didn't
go straight to Emmett.

32:06.044 --> 32:08.980
- That is not fair.
- It's what happened.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.083
I left and you dropped me
as soon as you could.

32:12.117 --> 32:15.219
And it's pretty clear
that's how it's gonna go this time, too.

32:15.254 --> 32:17.188
So why don't I just
save you the trouble?

32:17.222 --> 32:19.724

Her mom either already knows

32:56.587 --> 32:58.688

In my experience,

33:02.593 --> 33:05.495
most secrets
come out eventually.

33:06.764 --> 33:09.499
And if she has
to find out from someone...

33:11.502 --> 33:13.436
wouldn't it be best
coming from you?

for "Poker Face."

33:38.696 --> 33:40.496
So what did you do?

33:40.531 --> 33:43.666
Call Carrie and tell her
that I dated Jeff?

33:43.701 --> 33:47.437
- Why did you do that?
- I hate seeing people lie

33:47.471 --> 33:49.772
and get away with it.
You know that.

33:49.807 --> 33:51.541

33:51.575 --> 33:53.242
It's not my fault.

What, so you're just okay

33:55.579 --> 33:58.314

somebody's engagement,

33:58.349 --> 34:01.484

or blackmailing a senator?

34:01.518 --> 34:03.286

of that wallet.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.022
It was like 40 bucks!
It's different!

34:06.056 --> 34:08.224

to send that text to Coto.

34:08.257 --> 34:10.360

between you and me

34:10.393 --> 34:13.228
is I don't lie
to myself about who I am

34:13.263 --> 34:16.232

34:51.168 --> 34:53.168
I think I'll go clean
the kitchen.

34:56.407 --> 34:59.175
The ticker is recuperating.

34:59.209 --> 35:01.811
That's good. Good.

35:05.249 --> 35:07.717
What the hell are those things?

35:08.852 --> 35:10.753
Daphne makes me eat those.

35:10.788 --> 35:12.855
What does
she look like, anyway?

35:12.890 --> 35:14.857
Does she have
any Kennish in her at all?

35:17.761 --> 35:21.864
Yeah.
Actually quite a bit.

35:26.603 --> 35:28.438
<i>Hmm.</i>

35:29.640 --> 35:31.674
You know, I wouldn't--

35:31.708 --> 35:36.212
I wouldn't mind...
meeting her someday.

35:39.183 --> 35:41.150
- ( Inhales sharply )
- <i>( Keyboard clicking )</i>

35:43.253 --> 35:45.054
You feel like
staying for dinner?

35:50.360 --> 35:53.096
Sure. Why not?

35:55.933 --> 35:57.166
( Frame clatters )

36:00.037 --> 36:02.171
Nikki:
Peonies are pretty, right?

36:03.740 --> 36:06.142
Yeah, they look nice.

36:06.176 --> 36:09.645
- ( Inhales deeply ) - Sorry, I don't
know how to talk about flowers.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.681
You know, you've...

36:11.715 --> 36:13.916
been weird
ever since we got back.

36:15.652 --> 36:17.553
What happened?

36:17.588 --> 36:18.688
Nothing.

36:18.722 --> 36:21.624
Toby, what did
that guy say to you?

36:24.461 --> 36:27.497
Whatever it is, I think
I have the right to know.

36:28.565 --> 36:30.466
( Inhales deeply )

36:33.270 --> 36:35.071
( Sighs )

36:45.082 --> 36:46.916
He said that...

36:48.051 --> 36:50.186
the reason he was there

36:50.220 --> 36:52.989
was because he was
buying drugs from your dad.

36:53.023 --> 36:55.158
What are you saying?

36:55.192 --> 36:57.693
He said that
he had been buying...

36:57.728 --> 37:00.096
stuff from him for...

37:00.130 --> 37:01.697
quite some time.

37:01.732 --> 37:04.000
( Exhales sharply )
Well, it's not true.

37:05.636 --> 37:06.903
Okay.

37:06.937 --> 37:08.738
Why would you say that to me?

37:08.772 --> 37:10.740
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

37:10.774 --> 37:13.743
And you believed him?
A murderer in prison?

37:13.777 --> 37:16.546
How could you believe
anything he says for one minute?

37:16.580 --> 37:19.382
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I just...

37:19.416 --> 37:22.418
I guess I'm wrong.
I-- I should've realized that--

37:22.452 --> 37:24.420
No, Toby.
You didn't know my dad.

37:24.454 --> 37:27.223
And that guy in there?
He's insane!

37:27.257 --> 37:28.291
I don't know what's worse--

37:28.325 --> 37:30.459
the lie
or that you believed it!

37:35.032 --> 37:36.365
( Sighs )

37:42.655 --> 37:44.222
Hi.

37:51.364 --> 37:53.264
Oh, your hoodie. Yes.

37:53.299 --> 37:54.499
Yeah, okay.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.368
Got it right--
right here.

37:56.402 --> 37:58.103
Yeah.

38:05.911 --> 38:09.080
Uh, I'm sorry, I missed that.

38:11.984 --> 38:13.918
( Phone clicking )

38:17.690 --> 38:18.757

38:21.994 --> 38:23.561
Yeah, uh, sure.

38:24.563 --> 38:25.764
Uh, yes.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.669
I'm-- I'm, uh...

38:30.703 --> 38:33.605
( Slowly )
Ma-ry--

38:33.639 --> 38:34.739

Well, it's no "Captain Kronos,
Vampire Hunter,"

39:32.932 --> 39:35.033
but that really challenges
the rules of the genre

( Laughs )
When I was little,

41:46.565 --> 41:50.702
my mom used to make Ty bring me
to the screenings at Carlton,

41:50.736 --> 41:53.838
because she was worried
that I would be too scared.

41:53.873 --> 41:55.807
