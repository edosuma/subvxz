WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.097
"Don't be afraid of the dark?"
What? Are you kidding me?

00:05.255 --> 00:06.256
Of course you should be
afraid of the dark.

00:06.423 --> 00:07.463
You know what's out there!

00:07.591 --> 00:08.763
- It was the Tooth Fairy.
- A leprechaun.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.348
Why did it have to be clowns?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.434
I'd say you have
a bunch of elves working for ya.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.597
Fairies? Come on.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.765
- This is Cupid?
- Heaven...

00:14.932 --> 00:17.856
- It was a little, glowing, hot...
- Nipples?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.895
- ...naked lady.
- Well, that's super disturbing.

00:20.062 --> 00:21.742
I've never seen
a baby monster before.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.233
Why?

00:25.234 --> 00:26.354
Why is it so hard to believe

00:26.401 --> 00:28.601
that God could be sending me visions
about The Darkness?

00:28.779 --> 00:32.409
- What are you trying to say?
- Don't count on God, okay? Count on us.

00:32.616 --> 00:36.211
If it is God, then he's showing me
something I don't know what to do with.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.462
The Cage.

00:37.621 --> 00:38.713
Lucifer's Cage?

00:39.248 --> 00:40.249
Yeah.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.255
What if he's
telling me I have to go back?

00:54.972 --> 00:56.098
Here you go.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.893
One spoonful of sugar or two?

01:10.070 --> 01:13.324
Maddie, Daddy and I are ready
to go to dinner now.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.123
So whenever you're ready,
you just let us know.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.378
Sparkle and me
aren't done with tea, Mommy.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.670
Well, when you're ready.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.799
We have reservations.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.971
The RIE Manual says be patient.

01:32.134 --> 01:35.855
So now we wait for her to have fake tea
with her fake imaginary friend?

01:37.806 --> 01:38.807
Perfect.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.322
We can party forever

01:45.480 --> 01:48.029
while Mommy and Daddy
eat Cheerios for dinner.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.417
It's cool, Maddie.
Go with your mom and dad. I'll clean up.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.550
I love you, Sparkle.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.239
Hiya, Maddie!

02:38.200 --> 02:39.201
You're not Ma...

02:42.454 --> 02:44.172
Don't forget
to brush your teeth, sweetie.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.758
Sparkle!

04:16.339 --> 04:17.807
Surprise!

04:18.425 --> 04:19.426
Who are you?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.812
It's me, Sam! It's Sully!

04:22.888 --> 04:24.561
- What?
- You remember me, right?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.808
I made all your favorite snacks.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.358
We were friends. Like best friends.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.568
You remember?

04:34.649 --> 04:36.071
- Sully?
- Yeah.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.531
No, you're not real.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.951
Well, how'd you punch me then?

04:42.699 --> 04:44.451
This can't be happening.

04:44.868 --> 04:45.915
Dude.

04:46.995 --> 04:47.996
Who are you talking to?

04:48.872 --> 04:49.873
Him.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.552
Are you having a stroke?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.254
Do you smell toast?

04:57.214 --> 04:58.966
He can't see me unless I want him to.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.634
What is all of this crap?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.937
When did you start eating this stuff?
Is that marshmallows on nachos?

05:05.514 --> 05:06.811
Yeah, this wasn't me.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.232
It was me.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.565
And those are delicious.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.072
Wait a second. Can you see him?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.070
Uh-huh.

05:20.237 --> 05:23.992
Dean, this... Um, I think this is...

05:24.741 --> 05:27.915
Sully, my friend from when I was a kid.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.418
You mean Mork from Ork here
is your dumbass imaginary friend Sully?

05:34.584 --> 05:37.337
- Yeah.
- Uh, I'm not dumb or ass.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.759
I'm gonna get my gun.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.511
No, please.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.843
Someone killed my friend.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.431
You mean, your imaginary imaginary friend?

05:47.722 --> 05:50.082
First off, "imaginary friend"
is more of a descriptive term.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.528
How you just said it,
that was a little offensive.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.109
Just to be honest.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.902
Secondly, we're Zanna.

05:57.399 --> 06:00.448
Me and the victim, we're Zanna.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.250
We help kids. We're the good guys.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.750
Sam, tell him.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.208
Yeah, okay. Um...

06:15.041 --> 06:16.213
You know what?
I'm still trying to wrap my head

06:16.376 --> 06:17.936
around this whole you-being-real thing.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.180
Aw. Yeah, no, no, of course, no.
That's okay, that's okay.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.966
This is all really unexpected.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.293
Yeah, that's one word for it.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.808
It's just that I need your help.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.433
I mean, you're hunters.
That's what you do, right?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.977
I mean, you help people, too.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.861
Yeah. Yeah, people.

06:35.687 --> 06:36.984
You are not that.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.407
- Dean, come on.
- "Come on"?

06:39.566 --> 06:40.692
Are you kidding... Look.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.746
This... Mother...
You and me, library, right now.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.285
Come on!

06:55.999 --> 06:57.046
Ah-ah!

06:58.168 --> 07:01.217
Yeah, no, I'll just stay here. Coolio.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.436
You're not actually buying this crap,
are you?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.689
Dean, when I was nine years old,
you know what I wanted more than anything?

07:11.806 --> 07:13.023
Marshmallow nachos.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.563
Yeah, you were a weird-ass kid.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.603
Yeah, well.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.372
The only person I ever told about it...

07:19.856 --> 07:21.199
- Sully?
- Yes.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.538
I don't know, man. Hey, you know,
maybe this is just one of your visions.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.098
Yeah, except we're both seeing it.

07:28.657 --> 07:31.001
And it doesn't involve the Cage or Lucifer

07:31.159 --> 07:34.254
or me having to talk to Lucifer
in the Cage.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.164
Look at this. Here.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.879
"In Romanian lore, Zanna are creatures
who guide and protect lost children.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.928
"Zanna intentionally appear
as figments of the child's imagination,

07:46.091 --> 07:47.718
"allowing the child
to move on with confidence

07:47.884 --> 07:49.886
"once guidance is no longer necessary."

07:50.387 --> 07:51.934
Maybe Sully's telling the truth?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.561
Okay, say Bozo is legit, right?

07:54.724 --> 07:55.804
Which, you know...

07:56.059 --> 07:57.902
"Hello, crazy-town," but okay.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.404
How is this our problem?

07:59.604 --> 08:00.605
Because someone's dead.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.649
No, something is dead.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.977
A fairy godmother getting capped?
That ain't our beat.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.704
- Yes, I know that, Dean, but...
- But what?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.991
But as messed up and insane
as this sounds,

08:12.200 --> 08:13.326
Sully helped me.

08:18.707 --> 08:19.754
That's the place.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.510
It's a horror show in there.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.621
You mean, you've been inside?

08:25.755 --> 08:26.972
Last night.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.727
I'm in management now,
so I don't get out in the field much.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.099
I just came to see Sparkle.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
Sparkle?

08:40.227 --> 08:41.354
Yeah. Oh.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.613
I show up and...
Man, the place was bananas.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.449
The kid had called the cops,
mom's freaking out.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.496
Sparkle.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.792
Sam, it was horrible.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.961
Okay, so according to Zanna rules,
the kid is the only witness, right?

09:00.623 --> 09:01.840
Yeah.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.544
Oh. Poor thing.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.137
I'll meet you inside.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.872
All right, what are you thinking?

09:20.310 --> 09:23.439
Good, the Bert and Ernie pretext. Awesome.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.741
Dude...  You didn't have to come.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.404
This whole imaginary-friend thing
was dumb then and it's dumb now.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.010
Yeah, you've made that pretty clear.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.207
You didn't think to tell me
that he was real?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.330
Well, Dean, I didn't think he was.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.073
You saw the lore book, too.

09:38.161 --> 09:42.257
I mean, maybe when I was nine years old
I thought he was real, but I grew up

09:42.665 --> 09:45.293
or grew out of it. Whatever. I left it.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.428
And what'd you need Drop Dead Fred for
in the first place?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.634
I was kind of a lonely kid, Dean.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.299
You weren't lonely, you had me.

10:02.685 --> 10:06.030
Go on, bud.
Whatever happens, it's cool beans.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.944
Dean?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.613
- Hey.
- Did you ask?

10:14.906 --> 10:16.123
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.584
Come on, you said...

10:18.743 --> 10:20.165
Look, I said I would ask.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.955
Dad said no,
what do you want me to do about it?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.374
But I've been shooting.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.419
I can run two miles,
I know silver kills werewolves and...

10:26.584 --> 10:27.881
- Sammy.
- No fair.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.054
You started hunting
when you were younger than me.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.893
Yeah, well I never had
an imaginary friend.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.390
I heard that.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.393
Don't listen to him, Sammy, he's a germ.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.362
You know, maybe you can come next time.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.476
Sure.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.318
All right, I gotta go.
I'll call you in a couple days.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.400
Yep. I'll just be...

10:47.939 --> 10:48.940
...here.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.709
Hey, come on. We can finally
make those bottle rockets, right?

11:08.251 --> 11:10.504
- Can I help you?
- Mrs. Berman, I'm Dr. Strummer,

11:10.670 --> 11:12.270
- this is my associate...
- Dr. MacGowan.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.425
We are trauma counselors
with Child Services.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.720
We're here to follow up
on a police report filed yesterday?

11:18.094 --> 11:21.894
Oh, that was... Come in.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.944
My daughter, Maddie,
she's the one who called.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.076
Uh, she has an active imagination.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.114
She made up this unicorn-man, Sparkle.

11:37.864 --> 11:41.414
But, um, she thinks he's dead in her room.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.956
So Sparkle was a unicorn and also a man?

11:46.289 --> 11:47.882
- Yeah.
- So, a manicorn.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.670
'Q...

11:52.879 --> 11:54.677
- I guess.
- May we, uh...

11:55.215 --> 11:56.933
Yes, please. Right here.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.815
Hey, Maddie.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.652
My partner and I would like to ask you
about last night.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.738
About Sparkle?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.322
Your mom says
you don't wanna go back into your room?

12:18.529 --> 12:19.530
How come?

12:22.408 --> 12:23.534
All the blood.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.465
This has been her room
since she was a baby.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.598
She's loved this room
and then last night...

12:36.756 --> 12:38.258
Do you mind if we take a look around?

12:39.050 --> 12:40.347
I'll be right back.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.479
All right. What's the problem?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.352
I told you it was horrible.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.190
You mind enlightening us?

12:54.941 --> 12:55.942
Oh...

13:01.030 --> 13:04.204
If I show you all we can see,
you can't tell a soul.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.461
Oh. Yeah, 'cause chicks dig
the whole imaginary-friend thing.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.790
Fine.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.263
Oh.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.816
Oh, yeah, that kid
is gonna need all the shrinks.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.562
Wait a second. So his blood is glittery?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.944
Even when he's dead,
Sparkle can't stop shining.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.077
Who would do this?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.250
There's a blade.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.079
Sully, can Zanna see other Zanna?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.207
Of course,
but it's not what you're thinking.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.422
A Zanna could never do this.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.469
Nothing to see, right?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.596
I was always under the impression
that it was a parent's job

14:02.759 --> 14:05.478
to let a child be a child
as long as possible.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.956
- Oh, this is bad.
- Maybe we let her get too carried away,

14:08.139 --> 14:09.140
I don't know.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.731
I mean, an imaginary friend named Sparkle.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.566
What's cuter than that?

14:20.526 --> 14:21.527
Oh.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.455
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.000
I'm being as dramatic as my daughter now.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.288
Oh, it's on her face, Sam,

14:28.451 --> 14:30.249
- it's on her face.
- Just tell me.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.084
She's got Sparkle on her face.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.418
How do we get our girl back?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.133
Somebody's gotta say something.
Somebody's gotta say something.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.047
You know what? Is there a spare bedroom?

14:42.256 --> 14:44.634
Great. Uh, maybe Maddie can sleep there.
That should help.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.269
That's not the face.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.601
And a hot shower, it does wonders.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.142
Real deep scrub and purify.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.315
- For Maddie?
- The whole family.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.150
Yeah, just get the whole gang in there.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.695
You know,
the family that showers together...

15:00.733 --> 15:01.985
- Pull up. Pull up.
- Okay.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.916
You know what? Why don't you start there?

15:04.404 --> 15:07.658
You can contact our office
for more guidance, if you'd like.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.498
Okay.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.017
Oh, my gosh, Zoe.
I think I saw the treasure, too.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.176
Let's go for it!

15:27.343 --> 15:28.595
But wait, don't you have gymnastics?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.809
Oh, yeah.
Let's look at it when I get back.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.098
Right on.

16:27.028 --> 16:30.407
Nicky didn't check in with
the home office last night.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.204
This can't be happening.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.997
You Gazoos can talk to each other?

16:34.535 --> 16:37.288
Us Zanna share a telepathic link.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.836
She wouldn't be in there.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.349
A freaking mermaid?

16:48.841 --> 16:50.309
It's a bloodbath.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.101
It's all right, just let it out.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.693
No, no, I gotta stay strong for Sam.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.405
Looks like more stabbing.

17:04.106 --> 17:08.202
Okay, Sully, is there anybody
that would wanna hurt, uh, Nicky?

17:08.611 --> 17:09.782
No.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.113
Well...

17:12.031 --> 17:13.078
What?

17:13.281 --> 17:15.751
I mean,
her boyfriend's a little clingy,

17:15.910 --> 17:17.877
but he's one of my best friends.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.128
Guys, Weems would never hurt Nicky.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.634
I mean, he loved her too much.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.045
Well, "too much" ain't good.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.634
So let's go
talk to the mermaid's boyfriend.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.846
Because, apparently,
imaginary friends have boyfriends now.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.814
Wait, wait! We can't just leave her here.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.645
It's disturbing for the kid.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.856
All right, well, what do you wanna do?
Find a giant toilet and flush it?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.991
You're right. I was...
What would you like us to do?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.994
I think I saw some shovels back there.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.822
Okay.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.921
Well, Totoro really cares for you, huh?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.170
Okay, I got one.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.505
Hit me.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.679
Ever think you can fly?

18:13.175 --> 18:18.306
Oh... Sometimes.
Like on really windy days. You?

18:19.015 --> 18:21.939
I used to, but I broke my arm.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.405
- Your turn.
- Okay.

18:26.897 --> 18:31.528
Ever think...
You could eat 10 waffles in one sitting?

18:31.861 --> 18:34.455
Well, I hope so, when I'm big. Can you?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.333
I tried, once.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.873
Oh. Head rush.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.551
Ever think

18:51.714 --> 18:53.011
about running away?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.218
From you? No way.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.388
No, I mean, from here.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.771
All of this, the hunting life.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.269
Do you?

19:10.399 --> 19:11.400
Hmm.

19:13.027 --> 19:17.703
Ever think
that maybe you wanna go to school?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.579
Make some friends?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.543
Well, I have you.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.496
Yeah, you do.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.259
But one day you won't.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.927
Sam, I want you to listen to me.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.056
You can be whatever you wanna be.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.603
You're not Dean. You're not your dad.
You're Sam.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.360
And Sam is so awesome.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.322
Can you imagine? Running away?

19:51.565 --> 19:53.613
My dad would kill me.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.069
Well...

19:56.070 --> 20:00.450
It's your choice, Sam. It's your life.
I mean, it's all up to you.

20:09.792 --> 20:10.918
Okay.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.636
Okay?

20:12.837 --> 20:14.054
Let's go.

20:22.638 --> 20:23.639
Hey, slacker.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.817
Am I burying Ariel by myself here or what?

20:27.184 --> 20:28.185
No. Yeah, of course.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.649
Let's go.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.535
How you holding up, Sully?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.908
I'm fine. How are you, Sam?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.668
Aces.

20:52.543 --> 20:56.798
Don't worry, kid.
Everybody's got a pee-pee problem.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.601
Weems will take care of these sheets
and Mommy will be none the wiser.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.811
What if Mommy hears us?

21:02.970 --> 21:07.350
Fletcher, not even a parade
could wake Mommy up tonight.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.319
Because she drank her grown-up juice
and went sleepy-bye?

21:11.187 --> 21:14.282
Yep, Mommy drank a lot of juice tonight.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.319
Hey, you wanna try and hit the sack?

21:19.028 --> 21:21.577
All right, I'll catch you
on the flip side, okay, bud?

21:22.198 --> 21:23.370
Thanks, Weems.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.205
You got it.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.229
Sully.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.272
Sully.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.282
Sully, help.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.611
Help, Sully...

23:36.832 --> 23:39.176
Weems. Weems. Are you okay?

23:39.335 --> 23:40.837
Yeah.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.177
It went right through my love handle.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.060
My fat saved me. Can you believe that?

23:48.302 --> 23:49.679
- Fat is the best.
- Yeah.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.730
Yeah, well, the mermaid wasn't so lucky.

23:53.474 --> 23:54.521
Is he talking to me?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.561
Who are these guys?

23:58.354 --> 23:59.526
They're friends.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.029
Hey, Weems, when was the last time
you saw Nicky the Mermaid?

24:03.192 --> 24:04.614
God,
I can't believe I just said that.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.202
Yesterday. Why? What happened to Nicky?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.539
She was murdered.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.206
- What?
- Weems, I'm so sorry.

24:13.535 --> 24:17.256
No, she was my girl.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.876
Sparkle's gone, too.

24:20.042 --> 24:23.672
Not Sparkle.
Dude, that's like our whole posse.

24:23.837 --> 24:27.432
I know right?
But, hey, you're okay. You're okay.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.638
Okay, all right. So you're all pals,

24:28.801 --> 24:31.121
is there anybody who would have beef
with the bunch of you?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.893
I've never seen her before in my life.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.352
Wait a second. You saw somebody?

24:34.515 --> 24:36.233
Yeah. Some chick.

24:36.976 --> 24:41.231
After she shivved me,
she took off in an old VW bug.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.402
So this is a good thing, right?

24:46.568 --> 24:48.115
Uh, no, this is a great thing.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.782
I mean, a manicorn, a freaking mermaid?
What am I supposed to do with that?

24:51.949 --> 24:54.748
But a chick in a car?
That's terra firma, I'm home.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.955
All right, you go. I'll cover these two.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.591
It goes...
Yeah, it goes all the way through.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.552
I gotta ask. Hey, acid-wash.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.347
What's so special about you?

25:07.923 --> 25:09.300
- Mermaids dig me?
- No,

25:09.466 --> 25:11.685
I mean, why do kids like you?

25:11.844 --> 25:12.845
Oh...

25:14.638 --> 25:15.855
I play air guitar.

25:16.890 --> 25:17.891
You play air guitar?

25:19.935 --> 25:22.279
Sam plays air guitar.
I can play air guitar.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.059
Yeah.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.143
It's okay, it's okay.
Good solo, good solo.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.277
Well, he's no Clapton.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.364
No, I'm gonna go get some bandages.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.882
- Okay?
-  Yeah.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.327
Oh. I'll be right back, Sam.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.583
Wait.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.086
You're not that Sam?

26:21.830 --> 26:23.047
Sully's Sam?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.006
I guess I would be. Yeah.

26:27.169 --> 26:31.049
So now you and Sully
are, like, back together?

26:32.174 --> 26:33.676
- What?
- How old are you?

26:34.426 --> 26:35.678
- Wrong.
- Look, I get it.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.097
We all need a tune-up from time to time.
It's okay.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.264
No.

26:39.473 --> 26:43.478
He came to me. I am helping him out.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.403
Sam Winchester.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.200
I mean...

26:51.401 --> 26:52.402
Wow.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.906
Hey, just so you know.

26:56.657 --> 26:57.829
Sully?

26:59.535 --> 27:00.707
You broke his heart, man.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.050
Ready to hit the road?

27:11.672 --> 27:13.720
No, my dad just called.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.676
- Yeah?
- He changed his mind,

27:16.385 --> 27:17.637
he wants me to come with him.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.268
On a hunt?

27:20.430 --> 27:22.057
Finally, he thinks I'm ready.

27:22.224 --> 27:25.353
I have to catch the next bus to Milwaukee.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.044
Are you sure this is what you want?

27:27.146 --> 27:29.865
I'm a Winchester. I hunt monsters.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.442
Why would I want anything else?

27:32.276 --> 27:34.654
Well, I'm not sure it's you.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.161
Why can't you be happy for me Sully?

27:38.574 --> 27:39.575
Listen, buddy.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.625
I'm just afraid you're going down a path
you might be better off not going down.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.414
Yeah, but I am not afraid.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.460
I know you're not.
You are one of the bravest kids I know.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.839
It's just this whole hunting thing,
you know, it's not the only way.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.883
There are so many other ways
and you can find one, Sam.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.555
You can leave right now.

27:57.718 --> 28:01.768
I don't want another way,
I wanna be with my dad and Dean.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.685
Look, Sam, I'm just saying this
'cause I'm your friend.

28:05.851 --> 28:06.852
Pretend friend.

28:09.563 --> 28:10.940
You're not even real.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.109
Well, I'm here as long as you need me.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.949
I don't need you anymore, Sully.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.614
I don't even know why I made you up
in the first place.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.999
I wish I could un-make you up.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.458
If that's what you want.

28:25.621 --> 28:26.918
His, okay?

28:33.921 --> 28:34.922
Just go.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.928
You have a good, long life, Sam.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.831
- You did a good job.
- Is it too tight?

29:09.873 --> 29:10.874
No.

29:11.041 --> 29:15.262
All right. That's good.
Okay. There you go, pal.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.093
All right.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.345
Gotta go check on Fletcher.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.509
Oh...

29:21.093 --> 29:22.766
Kid has a bladder like a sieve.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.489
You know, it's pretty awesome,

29:34.606 --> 29:36.358
how you help everyone around you.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.365
It doesn't always work out

29:41.029 --> 29:42.030
but I try.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.710
Sully...  I feel awful.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.750
About how we left off.

29:50.289 --> 29:56.467
I'm sorry. I was a kid. I was a jerk kid
and you were trying to help.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.221
That's all on me.

29:58.588 --> 30:02.218
I mean, goodbyes are part of the job
and ours was...

30:02.843 --> 30:04.811
- Pretty bad.
-  Yeah.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.472
It was really bad.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.317
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you.

30:16.732 --> 30:17.949
When you went off to hunt,

30:18.108 --> 30:20.452
I considered that
one of my biggest failures.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.949
It just seemed so clear to me
that you wanted something else.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.251
But I was wrong.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.461
It all worked out, didn't it?

30:36.168 --> 30:38.262
- I don't know about that.
- Come on.

30:39.087 --> 30:42.557
You're a hero. Sam, you saved the world.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.267
I keep track of my kids.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.182
And you did really good, Sam.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.777
Yeah, well, not all good.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.689
There was some bad.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.450
And some really bad.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.279
Sully.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.788
I screwed up.

31:10.577 --> 31:14.673
I let something out into the world
that was...

31:15.082 --> 31:16.129
You mean The Darkness?

31:18.126 --> 31:21.596
That's what the others are calling it,
I just heard rumors.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.799
Well, I'm gonna fix it. lam.

31:24.925 --> 31:28.054
Dean and I, we're gonna fix it.
It's just...

31:28.887 --> 31:29.934
What is it?

31:31.306 --> 31:34.401
I think God wants to help us fix it.

31:38.897 --> 31:39.898
But...

31:40.857 --> 31:43.155
I don't think I can do what he's asking.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.326
How bad is it?

31:50.450 --> 31:53.670
There's this cage, in hell.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.623
And it's where they keep Lucifer.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.501
And I've been in it.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.552
And it's...

32:03.839 --> 32:07.184
And I think God wants me to go back.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.697
Ever think

32:22.357 --> 32:24.109
about running away anymore?

32:29.531 --> 32:32.250
I did, um, I mean, I have.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.088
But not in a while. Not anymore.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.600
Ever think

32:59.603 --> 33:01.731
about hot-wiring a minivan?

33:04.566 --> 33:05.909
In my dreams.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.698
Let's do it.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.627
Good, you're awake.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.430
Your brother's on the way.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.333
Who the hell are you?

33:59.663 --> 34:03.713
I think we have a mutual imaginary friend.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.547
You know, Sully?

34:29.025 --> 34:30.150
Hold it.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.280
Reese?

34:36.658 --> 34:41.380
Hey, stranger. You give me Sully,
I give you your brother.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.418
What do you want with Sully?

34:43.581 --> 34:44.799
Ask him.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.840
He's the one who killed my sister.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.933
It was an accident.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.183
What?

34:54.884 --> 34:56.886
Reese and her twin sister,
they were my first kids

34:57.053 --> 34:58.680
after I thought
I'd screwed things up with you.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.064
So this is his fault?

35:00.223 --> 35:01.224
No.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.811
No, Reese, I'm the one that bungled it.

35:04.561 --> 35:05.733
It was me.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.779
I should have never let her
chase me into the street.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.986
We were just playing tag.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.407
I don't know
why I didn't see the car coming.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.959
That's why I never went back in the field.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.336
That's why I never found another kid.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.002
I was too scared I'd hurt them.

35:24.205 --> 35:27.300
Do you know how bad you messed me up?

35:29.669 --> 35:32.548
"Audrey's dead
because of the invisible man."

35:32.714 --> 35:35.638
Try telling that
to about 10 different kiddie shrinks.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.226
I always wondered if Sully was real.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.891
So I got obsessed with folklore.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.946
I studied abroad in Romania
and then I found out he's a Zanna.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.815
Yes, and Zanna are good.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.904
That's what the witch tried
to tell me, too.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.068
The witch?

35:53.234 --> 35:57.239
She sold me a spell
so that I'd be able to see these freaks.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.618
She gave me this, too.

36:02.952 --> 36:07.332
Finally, I can save other kids
from these monsters.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.797
So you killed my friends
just to get to me?

36:09.959 --> 36:13.088
And I would've done it sooner
if these two hadn't showed up.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.762
Why didn't you call? I would have come.

36:17.676 --> 36:21.977
Honestly?
I kinda liked watching you suffer.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.767
You weren't just Audrey's best friend,

36:26.434 --> 36:27.902
you were mine, too.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.068
And after she died, Sully,

36:31.231 --> 36:33.450
I never needed you more.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.241
I panicked when Audrey died.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.125
And I left you to deal with the pain,

36:47.622 --> 36:50.125
'cause I couldn't handle
being the one that caused it.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.011
So maybe
I'll take something you love, Sully.

36:53.795 --> 36:54.967
A real person.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.552
That's not gonna happen.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.060
Would killing me make you feel better?

37:01.219 --> 37:02.641
No, Sully, that's not the answer.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.101
This is what I do.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.062
Whatever's best for the kid.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.602
Reesey.

37:11.187 --> 37:15.784
If this is what you need,
I'm okay with it.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.292
I am still mad.

37:26.786 --> 37:32.213
I can't stop it, I'm just still so mad!

37:43.178 --> 37:44.179
Reese.

37:45.722 --> 37:46.723
Trust me.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.183
Revenge,

37:49.309 --> 37:50.731
ain't gonna make you feel better.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.364
Listen, I have seen
more than my share of monsters

37:55.648 --> 37:58.572
and I mean real monsters, bad.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.665
These guys,
these are Sesame Street Mother Teresas.

38:04.991 --> 38:08.165
But when I wasn't there
for my little brother,

38:10.330 --> 38:11.331
Sully was.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.962
Now look, I'm not saying
that he didn't make a mistake,

38:17.712 --> 38:20.556
but you know that
there's not a monstrous bone in his body.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.855
I am so, so sorry.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.212
Reesey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.109
Well, now that you know about Audrey,

39:17.272 --> 39:19.240
you probably never wanna
see me again.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.035
Ever think maybe you're a hero to me?

39:28.533 --> 39:29.534
Sully.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.953
One thing I've learned,

39:32.745 --> 39:33.997
heroes aren't perfect.

39:34.914 --> 39:35.915
Hmm.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.549
Sometimes, they're scared.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.802
But that just means the thing
that they're facing,

39:44.757 --> 39:46.054
it's super important.

39:47.635 --> 39:51.185
And nobody else is gonna go for it
because nobody else has got the balls.

39:54.309 --> 39:57.438
Well, it is that time again.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.778
You, um, gonna look in on Reese?

40:01.024 --> 40:03.152
Don't worry, I will be checking in.

40:03.735 --> 40:07.114
And Dean, thank you
for looking out for Sam.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.333
You are not a germ at all.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.453
Thanks.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.756
You know, you're not gonna
ever get me to admit

40:16.915 --> 40:18.675
that you're not the weirdest thing
out there,

40:21.169 --> 40:22.341
but, um, you're good-weird.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.213
Mmm.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.554
Good luck, buddy.

40:32.680 --> 40:33.852
Let's do it.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.129
Dean, we need to seriously
discuss me going to the Cage.

40:58.581 --> 41:01.585
Okay. Not happening. Good talk.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.885
Sam, even if these visions are real...

41:10.051 --> 41:14.101
Yeah. It's Lucifer. And me.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.478
In the Cage. I know.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.566
But this... There's a lump in my throat.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.566
It's not an excuse. Not anymore.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.070
We'll find another way, okay?
There's always another way.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.032
Okay.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.494
Then tell me,

41:38.746 --> 41:40.419
what is the other way?

42:22.457 --> 42:23.458
English - SDH
