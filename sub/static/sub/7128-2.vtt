WEBVTT

00:03.490 --> 00:05.290
American dollars?

00:05.880 --> 00:08.580
You talking to me?
'Cause I can have you smited. I know people.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.910
Guy wants to charge me 3,000 bucks for us

00:10.980 --> 00:14.000
to sit behind the concrete pylon outside marvel stadium.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.540
That's ironic,'cause I don't even wanna be
in marvel stadium tonight.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.070
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.040
Besides,it's the last game ever
before they tear that stadium down.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.840
You know, dad used to take us all the time.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.110
He used to take you all the time.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.680
I went once, and I got hit in the ear with a foul ball.

00:28.410 --> 00:30.650
oh, god. Why won't you let me do this for you, eli?

00:30.770 --> 00:32.020
'Cause it's not my birthday.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.870
My aneurysm came back.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.610
You still haven't leveled with me, and I know it.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.270
I was the one with the symptoms,

00:40.350 --> 00:41.380
the visions, the fainting--

00:41.500 --> 00:43.450
and my M.I. Comes back clean?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.170
If it makes you feel any better,

00:45.240 --> 00:47.900
I haven't had a single vision
since the aneurysm came back.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.540
Nate?

06:33.100 --> 06:35.510
<font color=#38B0DE>Eli Stone Season 2 Episode 2</font>

02:18.890 --> 02:20.280
this wasn't a regular vision,frank.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.260
This was like someone spiked the vision punch.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.260
George michael again?

02:23.380 --> 02:24.260
Duke ellington.

02:24.330 --> 02:27.160
Eli, you were engaged to a real-life,

02:27.280 --> 02:28.650
nonhallucinogenic woman.

02:28.770 --> 02:30.900
It's like when you come out of
a movie in the middle of the day,

02:31.020 --> 02:32.750
and everything seems that much brighter...

02:32.870 --> 02:35.130
because you've been sittin' in the dark all that time.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.470
You're right. I'm rusty.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.760
What do I do?

02:38.870 --> 02:40.390
Same thing you used to do--wait,

02:40.470 --> 02:41.880
follow the signs.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.130
I'm gonna see if there are any cases
that might be related.

02:44.260 --> 02:46.070
Is there a legal directory for that sort or thing?

02:46.150 --> 02:47.500
No, but there's maggie.

02:47.620 --> 02:48.570
Where is she?

02:48.690 --> 02:51.630
Running around,complaining about
the assignment you gave her.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.470
Are we suing duke ellington,eli?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.830
Probably not. He's dead.
Are you done with that memo yet?

02:55.950 --> 02:56.640
No.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.630
Do you know when you will be?

02:57.710 --> 03:01.020
I'm sorry, eli, but you cannot
tell the people you work with

03:01.100 --> 03:04.370
that your life-threatening medical condition is back

03:04.440 --> 03:06.590
on an interoffice memo.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.170
You're right. An e-mail would be faster.

03:08.290 --> 03:11.260
Well, if you want people to know,
you need to talk to them.

03:11.340 --> 03:12.710
I'm tired of talking about it.

03:12.830 --> 03:13.740
Tired of talking about what?

03:13.860 --> 03:14.900
Ah. What do you got?

03:14.970 --> 03:16.880
A woman right here in san francisco is claiming

03:16.990 --> 03:22.040
that she was bitten by a pit bull named"wait for it"
duke.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.770
Maggie, my co-workers already think I'm marble-deprived.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.040
I don't think that representing a dog on my first case back

03:27.160 --> 03:28.560
is gonna change that perception.

03:28.690 --> 03:31.950
Eli, someone's here to see you-- an actual client.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.120
Really? What's she look like?
She got brown eyes?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.440
Mr. Stone?

03:35.580 --> 03:37.260
This might sound a little crazy,

03:37.380 --> 03:39.620
but you don't by any chance have a daughter in her late 20s?

03:40.240 --> 03:41.490
Maggie dekker.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.520
Thomas hayes.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.540
- A much-younger half sister?
- Eli.

03:44.690 --> 03:49.220
No. I have a son... had a son.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.930
He died in iraq.

03:51.010 --> 03:52.770
It happened in karmah three days ago.

03:54.780 --> 03:56.400
I'm very sorry.

03:56.510 --> 04:00.470
I came here because I heard
you're willing to take unpopular cases.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.650
Uh, what type of case,mr. Hayes?

04:02.720 --> 04:05.490
I need you to stop the army from burying my boy.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.820
so your son was in the army,

04:08.900 --> 04:11.010
but you don't want him to receive a military burial.

04:11.730 --> 04:13.430
Daniel wouldn't have wanted it--

04:13.560 --> 04:16.310
the burial, the honor guard,any of it.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.779
The department of defense doesn't send
an honor guard detail

04:18.860 --> 04:21.149
unless one is specifically requested by the family.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.880
Why wouldn't the army honor your wishes?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.220
The army's not the problem.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.480
My wife is.

04:25.630 --> 04:27.790
She's listed as his next of kin,

04:27.910 --> 04:31.280
and she wants all the pomp and
circumstance of a military funeral.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.690
How can you be so certain about
something your wife doesn't seem to know?

04:34.820 --> 04:37.770
Well, they had a different relationship,
but that's the problem.

04:37.930 --> 04:39.930
She doesn't believe me when I tell her.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.120
What do you mean?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.640
She wants to believe daniel died
in the service of something great,

04:44.810 --> 04:47.650
but that's not how he wanted to be remembered.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.640
To be blunt, you being ex-military
and your son getting killed in battle,

04:52.720 --> 04:54.330
I would--daniel wasn't killed in action.

04:54.450 --> 04:55.990
His heart just gave out on him.

04:56.150 --> 04:59.580
Hypertropic cardiomyopathy, they call it.

04:59.660 --> 05:02.300
It's rare, it's hereditary,

05:02.450 --> 05:05.500
and it can go undetected and cause sudden death.

05:05.810 --> 05:08.360
But from what I've heard, mr. Stone,

05:08.480 --> 05:11.760
you have some personal experience
with that sort of thing.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.510
I'm so glad we came.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.390
It was totally worth 2 grand a ticket to be surrounded

05:31.510 --> 05:33.040
by a bunch of drunks with sausage breath.

05:33.110 --> 05:35.350
You can't get that at home, even in H.D.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.140
It's the last game in marvel stadium.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.630
Where's your sense of history?

05:38.700 --> 05:41.890
Oh, I left it at the gate with that
guy with the wand who frisked my privates.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.400
Oh! What the--

05:43.510 --> 05:44.920
lady, what's wrong with you?!

05:44.990 --> 05:45.940
I'm--I'm so sorry.

05:46.090 --> 05:47.100
- Man, sit down somewhere.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.440
that's her.

05:48.550 --> 05:49.460
That's who?

05:49.730 --> 05:51.970
that's the woman from my vision.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.620
It's really nice.

05:53.740 --> 05:56.080
She was singing to me,she was dancing.

05:56.200 --> 05:56.930
All right. Here,you got a little back here.

05:57.060 --> 05:59.180
Yeah, I don't think it's the same woman.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.910
No, no, no. Here, let me--
let me do this. Take this.

06:01.040 --> 06:01.760
just sit down.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.070
shut up!

06:03.190 --> 06:06.200
All that's missing are the pitchforks and the torches.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.010
Yo, balderrama! You can't hit!

06:11.080 --> 06:13.490
- The marvel!Suck
- what are you doing,dumb-ass?!

06:13.600 --> 06:15.200
This is the last game in marvel stadium!

06:15.280 --> 06:16.160
You cannot do this!

06:16.280 --> 06:21.070
Marvels suck!

06:23.690 --> 06:25.140
Thank You

06:25.350 --> 06:26.180
You're welcome

06:22.160 --> 06:23.650
You sit down. Yeah.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.030
You know you--you really don't have to do this.
It'S...

06:42.100 --> 06:44.260
of course I do. You saved me.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.820
This is mustard. This should come right out.

06:46.460 --> 06:49.050
What's this? cough syrup?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.620
Who threw cough syrup on you?

06:50.740 --> 06:53.010
I didn't see.
I was blinded by a slushee in the eyes.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.000
seltzer.

06:55.150 --> 06:56.420
That'll get that out.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.940
Seltzer--you carry seltzer in your purse?

06:59.060 --> 07:01.390
what are you, a traveling bartender?

07:01.610 --> 07:03.710
this sort of thing happens to me a lot.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.560
This kind of thing?

07:04.720 --> 07:07.730
Well, not this exactly,
but I do spill things a lot.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.990
Wow, you are not at all like the woman in my

07:10.060 --> 07:11.010
in your what?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.290
It's--is it possible that we met before?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.140
Like, like professionay?

07:15.650 --> 07:16.830
Do you need a lawyer?

07:16.950 --> 07:18.090
I am a lawyer.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.760
well, maybe you're a lawyer who--
who needs a lawyer.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.650
maybe we've appeared against each other.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.150
Or we're going to, or...

07:25.530 --> 07:27.740
I work for lawyers without limits,

07:27.860 --> 07:29.580
so unless you're a third world despot

07:29.690 --> 07:31.390
or you represent them, I dot think so.

07:31.540 --> 07:34.320
I'm eli. Eli stone.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.910
Ring any bells?

07:38.540 --> 07:41.980
Please.I'm not the kind of guy that
you obviously think I am right now. I'm just...

07:43.540 --> 07:45.000
I'm grace.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.870
Please don't comment on the irony.

07:47.990 --> 07:49.850
Look, I-I know this sounds crazy, but I just--

07:49.930 --> 07:54.260
I think that, that I was,meant to meet you.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.570
You know what? I bet you're a really nice guy, but...

07:59.260 --> 08:01.700
can I have my chapstick and pen?

08:01.820 --> 08:05.280
Oh, yeah. just... take my name and number.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.190
Please.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.990
It was really interesting meeting you.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.520
You, too, grace.

08:18.010 --> 08:20.300
Sounds like you got a way with women, dude.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.000
She wasn't exactly like the woman in my vision.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.230
She--she wasn't anything like her, in fact.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.960
She was sweet.

08:27.070 --> 08:29.590
She was funny. Her name is grace.

08:29.660 --> 08:31.480
You know how the bible defines grace?

08:31.670 --> 08:34.130
It's the spirit of god that exists in humans

08:34.240 --> 08:36.280
for the sole purpose of strengthening them.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.770
Where's the case in that?

08:37.880 --> 08:40.520
Why are you looking for a case
when you just took on a new one?

08:40.710 --> 08:42.700
Maybe she's here for you.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.870
Maybe for once your vision's meant
to bring you some joy.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.900
You think this is my consolation prize for

08:51.010 --> 08:53.760
jumping back on the aneurysm roller coaster last week?

08:54.220 --> 08:57.820
Maybe it's more like a reminder
that you're not alone.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.620
morning, sir.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.970
Glad to see you're keeping out of stairwells.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.820
At some point, I might have to get back
on that particular horse.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.650
Speaking of last week, have you given
our discussion any further thought?

09:15.760 --> 09:17.750
I did, and I had a brainstorm.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.010
For every hour of pro bono work,

09:20.130 --> 09:22.980
our associates get 30 minutes credit
to their billables quota.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.300
As brainstorms go, eli,
that's a little more like a drizzle.

09:26.460 --> 09:28.870
I had something more along these lines D.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.010
good to see you back, R.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.160
thank you.E 's nicto be back.

09:35.270 --> 09:39.030
Sir, when we talked about, changing the firm

09:39.100 --> 09:42.230
and taking it in a more socially responsible direction,

09:42.340 --> 09:46.320
I assumed that the firm would still have,
you know, clients.

09:46.430 --> 09:48.760
And it will. It will just have better ones.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.580
And have you shared this with
mr. Posner and ms. Klein?

09:51.700 --> 09:55.270
Eli, I've known martin and marci
since before you were potty-trained.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.330
I know exactly what their reaction
to this manifesto will be.

09:59.270 --> 10:00.980
you've got to be kidding me.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.060
The pro bono department you established
at the end of last year--

10:04.140 --> 10:06.350
you want to turn the entire firm into it?

10:06.420 --> 10:07.210
Not at all.

10:07.330 --> 10:10.720
Unlike pro bono cases,
we would charge for these services.

10:10.830 --> 10:14.900
But we'd be providing them to a more noble clientele.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.710
"Noble" clientele?

10:16.830 --> 10:19.710
We implement a hippocratic oath for our clients--

10:19.840 --> 10:23.120
committing to represent only those who do no harm.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.710
Except, apparently, to our bank accounts.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.520
the three of us right here--

10:31.020 --> 10:33.720
we're not who we were 30 years ago,

10:33.840 --> 10:36.610
and we're not who we set out to be.

10:37.710 --> 10:39.300
Do you remember this?

10:39.380 --> 10:43.110
Our mission statement.
Our plans for the firm we wanted to build,

10:43.230 --> 10:44.750
our dream for the future.

10:44.830 --> 10:50.140
- Jordan, seriously--can any of us say
our current client roster lives up to those ideals?

10:50.400 --> 10:55.020
I'm gonna make a presentation of my proposal
to a full meeting of all our partners.

10:55.140 --> 10:59.060
I expected some resistance,
but it would be ill-advised

10:59.130 --> 11:01.840
for either of you to stand in my way.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.570
I begged dny not to go.

11:04.690 --> 11:07.090
I even tried to bribe him with a new car.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.210
But he enlisted anyway,and the truth is,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.730
he seemed to come into his own over there.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.070
I just think if he had to die,

11:17.210 --> 11:19.870
at least I want to give his death some meaning.

11:19.950 --> 11:22.410
He didn't want a military burial, emily.

11:22.530 --> 11:23.560
He told me.

11:23.690 --> 11:26.400
I don'remember him ever calling home
and asking to speak to you.

11:26.490 --> 11:29.690
In any case, daniel designated
mrs. Hayes as his next of kin.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.570
Which is no longer enforceable
once the body has been released by the D.O.D.

11:33.650 --> 11:35.200
Will you trust me on this?

11:35.310 --> 11:36.920
I know what he wanted.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.700
He wanted to go to medical school.

11:39.820 --> 11:41.340
He was gonna be a surgeon, remember?

11:41.410 --> 11:42.600
I never told him to enlist.

11:42.680 --> 11:43.630
Oh, you didn't have to.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.540
It was crystal clear from the day he was born.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.640
The way you acted when he joined R.O.T.C.--

11:47.770 --> 11:49.170
It was the only time in his life

11:49.240 --> 11:52.030
you ever told him you were proud of him.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.920
Look, we should be able to work this out.

11:55.030 --> 11:57.500
Bringing this into court doesn't do anyone any good.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.630
Is that what you told them to do?

11:59.970 --> 12:04.190
My son is lying in a box on a tarmac somewhere.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.570
You couldn't let me make a decision about him even once?

12:11.590 --> 12:13.210
We'll be in touch.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.850
you okay, sir?

12:23.350 --> 12:26.430
That's the most she's said to me in three days.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.760
Eli? You have a phone call.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.030
She says she met you at marvel stadium.

12:35.390 --> 12:36.870
eli!

12:43.890 --> 12:44.800
hello?

12:44.870 --> 12:47.990
Mr. Stone? This is grace, from the game.

12:48.150 --> 12:49.650
I'm so glad you called.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.880
I, didn't think you would.

12:50.990 --> 12:54.530
listen, ever since yesterday,I couldn't stop thinking.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.840
I just had to know-- did you send me the ticket?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.040
I know it sounds crazy, but--

12:59.110 --> 13:00.750
what do you mean,send you the ticket?

13:00.830 --> 13:01.820
To the game.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.840
I got a ticket in the mail.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.500
It had a note-- "you are not alone."

13:06.660 --> 13:11.010
And I know that if I hadn't spilled the soda
or dropped the hot dog

13:11.130 --> 13:13.170
which inevitably led to me spilling the soda,

13:13.290 --> 13:15.940
there wouldn't have been a reason
for you to save me, so...

13:16.010 --> 13:19.030
- grace--there's still a big element of chance
to the whole thing, but--

13:19.100 --> 13:20.350
grace, slow down.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.390
But I was just wondering if asit w a
really elaborate way of hitting on me.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.470
I-I didn't buy you the ticket.

13:27.690 --> 13:29.180
You didn't?

13:29.640 --> 13:31.690
But I'd like to buy you lunch.

13:32.380 --> 13:35.120
I'm going to kenya in two days.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.030
For lunch?

13:36.150 --> 13:37.660
No, for work.

13:37.770 --> 13:40.220
Listen, it was really great meeting you last night.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.380
Have a great life.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.390
call the minister back and

13:54.490 --> 13:56.240
tell him we're filing a jus cogens brief

13:56.360 --> 13:58.550
and a motion under article 24.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.990
Grace, there's someone here for you.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.710
I can't take walk-ins.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.250
I-I don't think he's a walk-in.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.940
Did you... order lunch?

14:11.900 --> 14:13.950
You hung up on me.

14:14.220 --> 14:18.210
Fortunately, there's only one lawyers
without limits office in this city.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.320
Lucky me.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.330
So...

14:21.640 --> 14:25.780
well, see, I figured you never
actually got to eat your hot dog,

14:25.900 --> 14:28.330
and for some people,
it's the best part of the game, so--

14:28.410 --> 14:31.400
- you brought me a dozen, like--
- like roses,exactly, only smellier.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.350
Well, I don't have much to work with,
and I got even less time.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.510
You leave the country in, what, 48 hours?

14:36.630 --> 14:40.110
And I already made this huge hot dog investment.

14:42.790 --> 14:46.140
I have a brief to file in federal court.

14:46.670 --> 14:49.660
Why don't we share a hot dog on the way?

14:49.970 --> 14:50.960
Fair?

14:51.080 --> 14:52.450
That's fair.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.180
This...

14:57.460 --> 14:59.860
I got drinks, too.It's water so that

15:00.250 --> 15:01.580
you know, if you spill it--

15:01.660 --> 15:03.500
- I mean, when you spill it-
- quit while you're ahead.

15:05.580 --> 15:08.740
I admit I'm worried, dad.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.740
This big blowup between you,marci and martin,

15:11.820 --> 15:13.750
it's all anyone around here can talk about.

15:13.860 --> 15:15.570
Partners argue, taylor.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.180
Doesn't mean the firm is going to fall apart.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.840
I seem to recall the same
"fall apart" speech when I was 9.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.580
I'm not marrd to marci or martin.
Neither's my type.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.720
Posner and klein aren't gonna sit quietly by

15:25.790 --> 15:28.680
while you plot to take tens of millions of
dollars out of their pockets.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.780
I wasn't aware I was doing any such thing.

15:30.850 --> 15:33.880
Where might I be absconding with my ill-gotten gains?

15:33.990 --> 15:35.480
someplace tropical, I hope.

15:35.550 --> 15:37.610
Dad, this is a big deal.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.990
Anything new brings with it fear and fallout.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.800
It's like that roller coaster
I used to take you to in santa cruz.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.270
You get to the top of that first rise,

15:50.350 --> 15:54.460
all you can do is buckle in and ride it out.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.350
I always hated that roller coaster.

15:57.470 --> 15:58.680
You never told me that.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.820
Because I loved being with you.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.880
Are you with me now?

16:07.680 --> 16:09.210
always, dad.

16:11.540 --> 16:14.360
Actually,up until two years ago,
I was a bankruptcy lawyer,

16:14.440 --> 16:17.310
helping huge conglomerates avoid paying taxes.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.930
And you traded that all in for the morally bankrupt work

16:21.000 --> 16:23.020
of helping third world citizens?

16:23.100 --> 16:24.250
It's not that easy--

16:24.370 --> 16:27.310
flying into people's lives,
only to fly out again,

16:27.840 --> 16:30.180
never really putting down roots.

16:31.250 --> 16:34.160
You know the last time I bought
a nonminiaturized tube of toothpaste?

16:34.280 --> 16:36.030
That must be pretty tough on your love life.

16:36.150 --> 16:37.950
Objection, counselor.Relevance?

16:38.030 --> 16:40.850
it goes to opposing counsel's availability.

16:40.970 --> 16:43.250
Well, it's hard, you know?

16:43.330 --> 16:45.350
Truth be told, I haven't had a real date in two years,

16:45.420 --> 16:48.680
unless you count a long walk
I took with a rhesus monkey in cambodia.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.750
A lot can happen on a long walk.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.410
So why did you make the whole job switch?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.920
Oh, a lot of reasons.

17:03.030 --> 17:07.140
And you?How did you get retained by god?

17:07.369 --> 17:10.630
I mean, I figure he's a pretty tough client to bag.

17:11.690 --> 17:13.400
I westlawed you.

17:15.130 --> 17:17.770
You can't believe everything you read online.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.920
You didn't send me the ticket?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.319
No.

17:24.970 --> 17:28.349
But if you don't mind me asking,
what made you use it?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.340
I don't know.

17:33.030 --> 17:35.500
I spend all my time at work and on the road,

17:35.580 --> 17:38.520
and I'm always in the airport watching people

17:38.600 --> 17:41.470
have their magical airport moments.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.780
And I know it sounds stupid,but I just thought

17:46.580 --> 17:49.360
maybe I deserve a little magic in my life, too.

17:49.770 --> 17:51.890
I need to file this brief.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.160
Grace, wait.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.560
By the endf the week,
I'm gonna be practicing law in swahili.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.090
Have dinner with me.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.710
I know this incredible jazz place.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.600
I love jazz.

18:05.510 --> 18:06.850
How did you know that?

18:06.970 --> 18:08.810
If you say yes,maybe I'll tell you.

18:12.970 --> 18:14.300
Okay.

18:22.950 --> 18:26.310
His unit was heading back to their base camp for lunch,

18:26.430 --> 18:28.930
and he just keeled over--

18:29.050 --> 18:32.880
congestive heart failure from his condition.

18:32.990 --> 18:34.910
It was a random, senseless death.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.510
It could have happened here as easily as over there.

18:37.630 --> 18:39.440
Nevertheless,he died a solider.

18:39.860 --> 18:41.650
Why shouldn't he be buried like one?

18:41.770 --> 18:43.380
Because it's not what he wanted.

18:43.700 --> 18:48.310
He felt like this was a war of choice,not necessity.

18:48.510 --> 18:50.150
he told you that?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.320
When I last spoke with him,yes.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.160
On those occasions when he told you
he had grown disillusioned,

18:57.280 --> 18:59.680
was it with the war,or with the military,

18:59.750 --> 19:02.210
whose uniform he didn't wish to be buried in?

19:02.520 --> 19:04.380
I don't understand what you're saying.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.690
Like mr. Hayes, I'm straining to see the relevance.

19:06.810 --> 19:09.160
Simple--you can be against the war

19:09.280 --> 19:10.800
but not against e military.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.340
You can want to get out of iraq

19:12.460 --> 19:14.330
but not out of uniform--

19:14.410 --> 19:16.730
specifically, danny could.

19:16.850 --> 19:18.660
He would have despised the hypocrisy.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.300
You're a former military man yourself, mr. Hayes.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.050
Yes, I am.

19:22.170 --> 19:24.060
And you have requested a military burial.

19:24.180 --> 19:25.620
We're talking about what daniel wanted.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.840
Objection--nonresponsive.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.960
Mr. Hayes, have you requested a military funeral?

19:30.150 --> 19:31.670
Yes.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.550
And you think daniel would have despised the hypocrisy?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.350
Nothing further.

19:56.910 --> 20:00.230
Either the other partners are all late
for the partnership meeting,

20:00.390 --> 20:03.380
or it would appear I've been outmaneuvered.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.740
We are seeking a court order freezing your authority

20:07.820 --> 20:10.620
pending a complete psychological workup.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.610
You can't be serious.

20:14.390 --> 20:17.080
The motion was filed 15 minutes ago.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.720
I'm sorry, jordan.

20:30.050 --> 20:31.240
Eil,you ****

20:31.240 --> 20:31.940
In a minute.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.610
what about this place--"bradbury's-
-dinner and jazz.

20:34.610 --> 20:36.990
You need a reservationat least a week in advance.

20:36.990 --> 20:38.440
Maybe you could call and beg.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.010
And if I do,I'm doing it why?

20:40.010 --> 20:42.020
I told grace I knewan incredible jazz place.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.580
you lied to her.

20:43.580 --> 20:46.110
Well,when you find it,it'll stop being a lie.

20:46.110 --> 20:48.340
-Eli,we really got--
-the judge will wait.

20:48.340 --> 20:51.060
They can't start without us.That's how it works.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.090
Well?

20:52.090 --> 20:53.570
Try 52nd street.

20:53.570 --> 20:56.040
It's jazz nightfeaturing the elling-tunes,

20:56.040 --> 20:57.630
a duke ellington tribute band.

20:57.630 --> 20:59.320
Should be something special.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.780
Patti,have I told you how much I love you?

21:00.780 --> 21:02.520
Come on.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.410
Get her to court beerre h head explodes.

21:08.290 --> 21:10.370
when did daniel send you this video,mrs.Hayes?

21:10.370 --> 21:14.360
October 12th--a week before he was to come home.

21:17.770 --> 21:18.920
Hey,mom.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.160
Live from al karmah,
it's another "groundhog day" in iraq,

21:22.160 --> 21:24.740
and I am still standing.

21:25.070 --> 21:28.360
I got your letters,and I know you're worried.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.920
Don't believe everything you see in the news.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.250
We're doing some pretty great things here,like,

21:33.250 --> 21:36.750
refurbishing this old swimming pool
at a community center.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.980
We opened it yesterday,
and you've never seen so many smiling kids.

21:40.980 --> 21:44.480
Tell dad sergeant ellington's
putting me in for a soldier's medal,

21:44.480 --> 21:47.680
so might be coming home with a souvenir.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.790
I love you,and I'll see you soon.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.110
He certainly sounds like a
manembarrassed to be in uniform.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.730
this video is a snapshotof a moment in time.

22:01.730 --> 22:04.770
It's only relevant to tell u
daniel hayes' state of mindon october the 12th.

22:04.770 --> 22:06.340
it proveshe embraced his mission.

22:06.340 --> 22:08.060
It proves he builta swimming pool.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.760
It doesn't speak to howto dispose of his remains.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.500
It was all spin.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.520
Daniel was putting ona brave face to protect emily.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.970
I don't thinkit played that way.

22:16.970 --> 22:19.160
It played as someonewho's proud to be in uniform.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.510
You really think that afterseeing that,

22:20.510 --> 22:22.100
the judge won'torder him to be buried in it?

22:22.100 --> 22:23.860
It isn't what he wanted.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.320
I don'tknow how else I can say it.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.250
Well,how about by telling us
what you're not telling us?

22:27.250 --> 22:28.400
Who's sergeant ellington?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.240
Y whwould you...

22:30.240 --> 22:31.720
he was daniel's C.O.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.770
- Commanding officer.
- And who was ellington to you?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.420
I served with his father,but that's it.

22:35.420 --> 22:36.750
And what did he haveto do with daniel?

22:36.750 --> 22:37.500
Nothing.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.160
Where are you evengetting all of this?

22:39.160 --> 22:40.610
There's something going onwith sergeant ellington.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.940
He's important to this casesomehow--to danny.

22:42.940 --> 22:44.510
Don't call him that.

22:44.510 --> 22:45.690
You want to walk out?

22:45.690 --> 22:46.720
That's fine.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.780
But you hired me to help you help your son.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.280
I can't do that if you'renot being honest with me.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.830
You've done enough.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.240
stone,your aneurysm--was it contagious?

23:10.990 --> 23:11.890
Excuse me?

23:11.890 --> 23:14.410
Jordan,your ex-futurefather-in-law--you know,

23:14.410 --> 23:16.600
recently returnedfrom his near-death experience--

23:16.600 --> 23:21.330
he wants to take the firm pro bono,
which is latin for"buy cheaper suits.

23:21.330 --> 23:22.140
"I know.

23:22.140 --> 23:25.080
Yeah?Did you know thatklein
and posner slapped him with a lawsuit today

23:25.080 --> 23:27.260
to prevent the whole thing from hap--

23:30.020 --> 23:31.090
nut job.

23:31.090 --> 23:32.630
Obviously,we're fighting this.

23:32.630 --> 23:34.590
We are not fighting anything,sweetheart.

23:34.590 --> 23:36.450
This is between me and marci and martin.

23:36.450 --> 23:38.250
You can't go pro se here,dad.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.190
Look,I'll represent you.

23:39.190 --> 23:40.340
No,i will.

23:40.340 --> 23:43.080
Oh,so the attorney who should defend my fatherf
rom getting declared insane

23:43.080 --> 23:44.660
should be the least sane attorney we know?

23:44.660 --> 23:45.860
I'm not crazy,taylor.

23:45.860 --> 23:48.710
You told a judge in open court
you had a direct line to god.

23:48.710 --> 23:50.760
Well,in case you didn't notice,
that kind of worked out.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.410
You dad's standing here alive,isn't he?

23:52.410 --> 23:55.090
Yes,I am,standing right here.

23:55.090 --> 23:58.670
Eli,I know you feel responsible
for the changes I'm making,

23:58.670 --> 24:00.240
what I'm putting this firm through.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.550
How can I not feel responsible?

24:01.550 --> 24:03.410
Because you are not.

24:03.410 --> 24:08.830
I made my own choices,
and this one was a long time coming.

24:09.510 --> 24:11.780
I appreciate both of you wanting to help me.I do.

24:11.780 --> 24:15.780
But I can handle this myself.

24:21.440 --> 24:22.930
- He doesn't have this handled.
- He can't handle this.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.260
Taylor,he's doing this'cause of me.I have--

24:24.260 --> 24:28.430
you're right,and I will always
be indebted to you for saving his life,

24:28.430 --> 24:31.270
but,eli,I can't let you risk his firm.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.810
I am sorry.

24:36.260 --> 24:39.330
Theoretically,I'm behind jordan changing the firm,

24:39.330 --> 24:42.400
but--but cutting 60% of the clients is just...

24:43.230 --> 24:44.880
god,I'm so boring.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.530
No,you're not boring.

24:46.530 --> 24:48.090
-Eli--
-I'm like the worst date ever,

24:48.090 --> 24:50.600
and you're the most patient woman on the planet.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.310
No,I'm intested,really.

24:52.310 --> 24:56.300
No way.I am not talking about
my work problems on your last night.

24:56.300 --> 24:59.100
No,I'm just gonna hit reset,and from now on,

24:59.100 --> 25:04.640
you're gonna have the most memorable time of your life.

25:05.310 --> 25:06.300
Ooh,kobe burger.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.800
Just--just--aah!

25:07.800 --> 25:09.480
Just,just--sorry.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.190
Not 3-alarm fire memorable,though.

25:11.190 --> 25:12.710
Here.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.180
thank you.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.610
this is whyI haven't been out for so long.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.150
I am not fit for society.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.250
it's "hit mewith a hot note.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.400
"Hit me with a who note?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.440
The--this song.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.930
It's,duke ellington.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.280
Does this--this song mean anything to you?

25:35.150 --> 25:36.170
no.

25:36.170 --> 25:37.640
Grace,will you dance with me?

25:37.640 --> 25:38.810
No.

25:38.810 --> 25:40.800
I'telling you--I'm telling you,
I think we need to dance to this song.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.230
Eli...

25:42.230 --> 25:43.220
I cannot dance.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.180
Of course you can dance.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.530
This is a slow song.

25:45.530 --> 25:48.500
All we have to do is just,you know,sway.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.670
And what about your toes?

25:51.670 --> 25:54.220
They've been stood on before.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.260
Please,dance with me.

26:16.460 --> 26:20.720
so I seem to recall a,pretty clear agreement--

26:20.720 --> 26:23.040
dinner in exchange for an explanation.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.490
About the jazz thing?

26:24.490 --> 26:26.100
And the mystery ticket.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.700
I mean,either you are a stalker
who clearly does his homework,

26:29.700 --> 26:32.300
or there's something else going on.

26:35.710 --> 26:38.480
I know about the aneurysm.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.720
I-I--sorry I didn't tell you.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.870
I just--I guess I didn't know how.

26:42.870 --> 26:45.340
Well,clearly,you survived.

26:45.850 --> 26:50.450
It,recently,it came back.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.240
I'm sorry.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.560
No,it's okay.

26:53.560 --> 26:58.690
Obviously,it has its downsides,
but there's this weird other component.

27:00.380 --> 27:03.850
Grace,I didn't send you the ticket,

27:03.850 --> 27:06.660
but I did see you before we met.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.170
I get these...

27:08.170 --> 27:10.420
these visions because of the,

27:10.420 --> 27:11.640
you had a vision of me?

27:11.640 --> 27:13.210
Yeah.

27:13.630 --> 27:15.820
You were singing...

27:16.330 --> 27:19.110
in here.

27:20.240 --> 27:25.200
yeah,you were the sexiest,
most confident woman I've ever seen.

27:26.630 --> 27:28.790
that's funny...

27:29.530 --> 27:33.120
you know,because dancing with you here right now...

27:34.780 --> 27:37.980
I feel a bit like that.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.400
It's been a long time.

27:46.650 --> 27:50.670
Why did you suddenly change your life two years ago?

27:52.290 --> 27:56.630
This is a perfect moment.

27:58.140 --> 28:02.380
I don't want to ruin it with sad stories.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.750
Is it too sad to say I wish you weren't leaving?

28:13.520 --> 28:14.950
We can'T.

28:15.870 --> 28:17.570
I'm leaving tomorrow.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.900
I-I don'T...

28:21.520 --> 28:24.200
I don't want to complicate it.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.480
That'skay.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.960
Just keep dancing with me.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.410
how'd you know?

28:50.850 --> 28:51.930
Did we have a meeting scheduled?

28:51.930 --> 28:54.280
How did you know about ellingn?

28:55.240 --> 29:00.030
I got a tip from a very senior partner.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.340
But you're gonna have to fill me in.

29:04.610 --> 29:08.160
When danny was going through the enlistment process,he...

29:08.570 --> 29:11.040
needed help with the medical exam.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.880
I reached out to bruce.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.850
What kind of help?

29:15.130 --> 29:17.200
He failed his first physical.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.750
They caught his heart condition.

29:18.750 --> 29:22.670
It was a mild form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

29:22.670 --> 29:24.850
It was so mild,the doctor almost missed it,

29:24.850 --> 29:28.430
but it still would havedis qualified danny from serving.

29:28.430 --> 29:30.880
So your good friend sergeant ellington

29:30.880 --> 29:34.760
found a sympathetic doctor who looked the other way.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.620
Well,I checked.

29:35.620 --> 29:38.950
It's likebeing denied for flat feetor bad eyesight.

29:38.950 --> 29:40.760
It's notnecessarily life-threatening.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.050
It was a heart condition.

29:42.050 --> 29:43.320
Well,I gave him the choice.

29:43.320 --> 29:46.000
To enlist or forever disappoint his dad?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.170
That's--that's hardly a choice.

29:47.170 --> 29:50.630
The only thing that's keeping me going

29:50.630 --> 29:54.450
is making sure danny's last wish is granted.

29:55.470 --> 29:59.060
well,I'm not sure how we can do that--not without proof.

29:59.060 --> 30:03.220
He sent this to me a couple of days before he died.

30:05.090 --> 30:07.500
What did he say?

30:13.650 --> 30:15.440
"dad...

30:16.300 --> 30:18.610
"things have never been worse.

30:19.870 --> 30:22.640
"Last night,cox and i were going house to house,

30:22.640 --> 30:25.700
"dragging parents away from their kids at gunpoint.

30:26.020 --> 30:29.620
"In this one house,there was an iraqi father and his son

30:29.620 --> 30:32.130
"who couldn't have been much more than 10.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.610
"And the dad just wanted to get his kid out of there,

30:34.610 --> 30:39.780
"somewhere safe,and he wasn't gonna
let go of him until that happened.

30:40.530 --> 30:45.470
"And for a moment,I wanted to be that kid with that dad.

30:46.940 --> 30:52.130
"That dad never would have pulled strings
to put his son in harm's way.

30:54.550 --> 30:58.420
"You said I'd learn about myself if I went to war.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.820
"Well,I learned I'm not you.

31:00.820 --> 31:03.310
"I'm not a soldier.

31:03.310 --> 31:06.730
"And every time I put this uniform on,

31:06.730 --> 31:09.980
"I feel a little sicker...

31:10.330 --> 31:13.500
and I wanted you to know that.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.020
""If you're reading this e-mail,

31:20.020 --> 31:22.810
"it means I actually had the guts to send it.

31:22.810 --> 31:24.480
"Don't let mom see it.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.500
She's worried enough already.

31:27.900 --> 31:30.260
Daniel.

31:34.890 --> 31:37.980
"The law requires me to use the best evidence available

31:37.980 --> 31:40.830
to determinethe decedent's intent.

31:41.150 --> 31:44.650
I think,regrettably,this e-mail is it.

31:45.690 --> 31:48.300
Plaintiff's motion granted.

31:48.300 --> 31:52.330
Custody of daniel's remains will fall to mr.Hayes.

31:52.630 --> 31:55.010
You knew about his heart.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.370
- You knew.
- Emily,please.

31:56.370 --> 31:57.740
This is what I was afraid of.

31:57.740 --> 31:59.600
- Don't come home.E-mail the address.
- This is what he was afraid of.

31:59.600 --> 32:00.560
I'll send you your things.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.170
I don't want you near me.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.870
I should never have let you near my son!

32:13.000 --> 32:14.600
come on,eli,talk to me.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.120
What's there to talk about?We won.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.220
Yay.

32:17.220 --> 32:18.610
I'm sure there's a bright side.

32:18.610 --> 32:19.690
Like what?

32:19.690 --> 32:21.520
Well,you're having visions again,right?

32:21.520 --> 32:24.050
And without an aneurysm,that must--

32:24.050 --> 32:26.040
you didn't send the e-mail?

32:26.040 --> 32:28.320
I'm having computer issues.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.940
Patti,I asked you to do something for me,
something quite simple.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.370
Why can't you do it?

32:33.370 --> 32:35.210
What am I supposed to say?

32:35.210 --> 32:39.270
F.Y.I.,Eli stone,the manwe all stood a 3-night vigil for

32:39.270 --> 32:40.990
as he laid in a coma in the hospital,

32:40.990 --> 32:43.870
the man we all love,has discovered...

32:43.870 --> 32:46.670
"no,I'm not doin' it.I won'T.

32:46.670 --> 32:49.470
attention,everyone!Attention!

32:49.470 --> 32:52.160
I just wanted to let you know
that the aneurysm's back--

32:52.160 --> 32:54.070
big,bad,funnier than ever.

32:54.070 --> 32:56.170
I will do my best not to drop dead in your office.

32:56.170 --> 32:58.640
Thank you!

32:59.580 --> 33:02.220
was that so hard?

33:06.590 --> 33:07.950
I'm sorry.

33:07.950 --> 33:09.040
I didn't know.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.690
I really don't need your pity right now.

33:10.690 --> 33:12.110
Almost drowned in it last year.

33:12.110 --> 33:13.600
No offense.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.550
Who could be offended by that?

33:15.550 --> 33:16.890
It's happening to me again.

33:16.890 --> 33:20.610
My life is about to be defined
by a 3-millimeterpiece of tissue in my brain.

33:20.610 --> 33:23.800
Here's some news--the pity
you almost drowned in last year?

33:23.800 --> 33:26.940
That was self-pity,and it's back up
to your shoulders and rising.

33:26.940 --> 33:28.340
We're not doing this.You can go.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.160
Who are you so angry at?

33:30.160 --> 33:31.470
Do I have to pick just one?

33:31.470 --> 33:33.480
How about a client who comes to me for help,

33:33.480 --> 33:34.800
and I wind updestroying his marriage?

33:34.800 --> 33:37.680
A marriagethat was falling apart
under the weight of his guilt.

33:37.680 --> 33:41.750
And jordan--he's about to destroy something
he's spent his life building'cause of me.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.280
Jordan makes his own decisions.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.170
He always has.

33:44.170 --> 33:46.100
Including the one not to let me him.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.460
Convince him.Try harder.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.750
- Grace!
- What?

33:49.750 --> 33:53.340
I'm angry at grace.I finally meet someone I like,
and she's leaving.

33:53.340 --> 33:56.210
What's wrong with me?
Why don'tI get more than 48 hours?

33:56.210 --> 33:57.460
- Your brother nate.
- Nate!

33:57.460 --> 33:59.000
I'm mad at nate.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.870
If I hadn't gone to that stupid game in the first place,

34:00.870 --> 34:02.130
I wouldn't know what I was missing.

34:02.130 --> 34:04.510
Eli,I mean he's on the phone.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.520
Nate.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.910
That's what I said.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.070
Tell him I'm coming over.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.179
you bought her the ticket,

34:25.179 --> 34:27.460
and you brought me to that game for a reason.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.560
I don't know how or why.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.900
You did it.

34:37.340 --> 34:41.360
Remember how I told you that,
we were gonna have to talk sooner or later

34:41.360 --> 34:44.920
about you winning the aneurysm lottery again?

34:44.920 --> 34:47.530
Well,here we are.

34:47.530 --> 34:51.280
What does my aneurysmhave to do with you
sending a random stranger tickets to a baseball game?

34:51.280 --> 34:53.159
Well,you wouldn't tell me
how you got the aneurysm back,

34:53.159 --> 34:56.320
so I had to go looking for answers elsewhere.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.400
And you found them in a notebook?

34:59.400 --> 35:01.950
It's dad's journal.

35:02.310 --> 35:04.800
I found it in mom's garage in a big box of his crap

35:04.800 --> 35:07.400
that she can't bring herself to get rid of.

35:08.030 --> 35:10.110
Dad kept a diary?

35:10.110 --> 35:11.230
Kind of.

35:11.230 --> 35:13.080
Yeah,I mean,it reads like a crazy person's to-do list.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.530
There's names and dates and drawings,

35:15.530 --> 35:20.140
and I think he was writing down
everything that,he was...

35:20.140 --> 35:21.440
seeing.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.510
And it ahas to do with you.

35:26.370 --> 35:28.230
You now...

35:28.880 --> 35:31.700
ten years after he died.

35:33.310 --> 35:36.090
I read some of it,

35:36.090 --> 35:40.760
and I found out what you did for me,

35:40.760 --> 35:42.480
how you asked for the aneurysm back.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.650
Nate--dad said you were gonna do it.

35:45.650 --> 35:48.700
The entry is date doctober 14th--

35:48.700 --> 35:51.520
"E.Saves champ.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.820
"That was his nickname for me,you remember?

35:53.820 --> 35:55.120
What else does it say?

35:55.120 --> 35:57.360
A lot.All right?

35:57.360 --> 35:58.470
I didn't rl d alof it.

35:58.470 --> 36:01.350
Some of it makes some sense,
and a lot of it does not.

36:01.350 --> 36:04.610
Like sending grace a ticket to the game?

36:04.610 --> 36:06.940
And making sure that you were there.

36:06.940 --> 36:09.190
It told me the date of the game and--

36:09.190 --> 36:11.440
and--and who to send the ticket to--grace fuller.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.860
Her address?

36:12.860 --> 36:15.140
All of it.It's all in here.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.440
But why?

36:20.730 --> 36:23.240
Why did you ask...

36:23.240 --> 36:28.500
whoever you asked for the aneurysm back?

36:31.110 --> 36:33.700
'Cause I didn't want it to ruin your life.

36:33.700 --> 36:38.010
Maybe dad didn't want it to ruin yours,eli.

36:38.650 --> 36:42.830
Dad's words--"you're not alone.

36:43.680 --> 36:47.170
"I mean,he's trying to tell you
that you can still be happy.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.250
she's moving,nate.

36:55.020 --> 36:56.770
she leaves tonight,as a matter of fact.

36:56.770 --> 36:57.790
She can't leave.

36:57.790 --> 37:00.130
Well,she can,apparently.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.700
she's moving to africa.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.920
Yeah,so tell me.

37:08.930 --> 37:09.850
why'I meet her?

37:09.850 --> 37:10.710
I don't know.

37:10.710 --> 37:12.070
None of this makes any sense.

37:12.070 --> 37:14.190
I mean,after everything that she's been through...

37:14.190 --> 37:16.200
"everything" meaning what?Me?

37:16.200 --> 37:16.870
No.

37:16.870 --> 37:19.130
"Everything" meaning...

37:21.520 --> 37:23.470
you don't know.

37:23.470 --> 37:25.400
What?

37:31.010 --> 37:32.470
Here.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.740
oh,my god.

37:52.620 --> 37:54.120
Grace.

37:55.510 --> 37:57.140
Eli.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.900
What are you doing here?

37:58.900 --> 38:00.340
I know.

38:00.620 --> 38:04.520
I know about your heart condition.

38:07.030 --> 38:07.660
Grace,come on.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.580
I had to buy a one-way ticket
to alberta to get past security.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.570
It's called hypertropic cardiomyopathy.

38:13.570 --> 38:16.710
I know,and it's rare and it's hereditary,

38:16.710 --> 38:21.640
and it can go un-detected
and it can cause sudden death.

38:23.240 --> 38:26.870
Looks like we just keep finding things in common.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.760
Yeah.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.560
The guy with the defective brain
and the girl with the defective heart.

38:35.090 --> 38:37.560
When are we off to see the wizard?

38:37.560 --> 38:42.940
You keep asking me who sent you that ticket,
but you never asked why.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.730
Grace,I think I'm supposed to get you to stay.

38:48.880 --> 38:53.410
So you think a higher power wants to
stop me from helping people in kenya?

38:53.410 --> 38:56.450
Eli,I know that I don't have the experience
that you have with this,

38:56.450 --> 39:00.080
but I just--I just don't think
it's supposed to work that way.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.510
Then maybe I'm supposed to come with you.

39:02.510 --> 39:05.110
We both know that as soon as we got off that airplane,

39:05.110 --> 39:09.050
the only thing that would beon your mind is your boss.

39:09.050 --> 39:11.000
That's who you are,eli.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.340
- Grace--
- it's who I've fallen for.

39:14.340 --> 39:17.980
We both know that only one of us
is getting on that airplane.

39:18.460 --> 39:22.080
We weren't brought together for nothing.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.230
No.

39:24.230 --> 39:27.270
Oh,it wasn't for nothing.

39:28.910 --> 39:32.690
I think it was proof that
there was someone else out there like us,

39:32.690 --> 39:35.790
someone else for us.

39:38.190 --> 39:40.560
It was a reminder.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.890
That can't be all it was.

39:43.890 --> 39:46.320
That's not all it was.

39:51.340 --> 39:54.210
you gave it to me.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.740
my magical airport moment.

40:04.450 --> 40:07.320
don't those usually end with--with a--

40:12.260 --> 40:14.240
*** right a kiss.

40:18.090 --> 40:20.570
kiss and a good-bye.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.400
For now.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.650
Yeah?Tell me it's just for now.

40:27.950 --> 40:31.070
nobody knows what's gonna happen in the future.

40:31.980 --> 40:35.070
Not even you,eli.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.940
bye,grace.

40:53.390 --> 40:55.590
bye,eli.

41:00.230 --> 41:06.790
* if it's a friend you need *

41:06.790 --> 41:10.130
* let it be me *
