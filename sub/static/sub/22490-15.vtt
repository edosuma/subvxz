00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:42.575 --> 00:44.634
He's Randy, the oblivious
pizza delivery guy

00:44.677 --> 00:45.769
Ding, dong

00:45.812 --> 00:47.040
Here's your pizza, ma'am.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.749
Here's your pizza, ma'am.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.377
That'll be 18.44.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.887
I don't have any cash.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.515
Is there another way
I can pay for it?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.082
Do you have a credit card?

01:00.126 --> 01:02.890
Isn't there another way?

01:02.929 --> 01:04.260
Traveler's checks?

01:04.297 --> 01:06.527
No. I mean...

01:08.334 --> 01:10.632
Debit card?
We do the debit card now.

01:10.670 --> 01:14.538
Jeez. You sure are oblivious.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.270
He's Randy, the oblivious
pizza delivery guy

01:17.310 --> 01:18.572
Ding, dong

01:23.783 --> 01:25.546
He's about to crack.

01:25.585 --> 01:29.988
You've seen <i>World's Most One-sided</i>
<i>Fistfights Caught on Film.</i>

01:30.023 --> 01:34.357
Now check it out
Mardi Gras style!

01:34.394 --> 01:35.656
We take to the streets
of New Orleans...

01:35.695 --> 01:38.061
for wild Mardi Gras fistfights...

01:38.098 --> 01:40.430
that are more one-sided
than ever.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.029
You gumbo crazy for
these one-sided fistfights.

01:46.573 --> 01:49.906
These fistfights
are outrageously one-sided.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.501
I gare-ron-tee!

01:51.544 --> 01:53.409
What the...

01:53.446 --> 01:55.573
And the fistfights
really get one-sided...

01:55.615 --> 01:57.913
when Snoop Dogg makes the scene!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.885
Hey, y'all. Snibbity Diggity!

02:01.821 --> 02:03.448
Order now.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.459
Your mother is so fat,
when her beeper goes off...

02:06.493 --> 02:09.018
people believe she's backing up.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.187
Your mother is...

02:10.229 --> 02:12.198
Oh, my!

02:12.232 --> 02:13.927
The Educational
Wrestling Federation...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.298
is live and on the air.

02:15.335 --> 02:18.668
And trust me, folks,
it's gonna be one hell of a night.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.229
Buck McCoy here back again...

02:20.273 --> 02:23.333
with former U.S. Secretary
of Education Rod Paige!

02:23.376 --> 02:24.570
Hopefully tonight's event...

02:24.611 --> 02:26.545
will be intellectually
stimulating as well as...

02:26.579 --> 02:28.911
What's that? Something's
happening in the back!

02:31.184 --> 02:32.981
Here comes
Benjamin Franklin...

02:33.019 --> 02:35.351
and, ladies and gentlemen,
he does not look happy.

02:35.388 --> 02:38.289
Franklin played a vital role
building support abroad...

02:38.324 --> 02:39.689
for America's battle
for independence.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.023
And, pardon my French...

02:41.060 --> 02:44.325
but he also played a vital role
in getting his ass kicked...

02:44.364 --> 02:45.956
courtesy of the Wright Brothers.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.559
After last week's
Pearl Harbor job...

02:48.601 --> 02:51.331
Franklin has got to be
hungry for revenge.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.839
I suppose y'all saw
what the Wright Brothers did...

02:53.873 --> 02:55.932
to old Ben Franklin last week.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.966
Well, if y'all think
it's a bunch of bullcrap...

02:58.011 --> 03:00.070
give me a "Boo-yah"!

03:00.113 --> 03:01.171
Boo-yah!

03:01.214 --> 03:03.239
And, furthermore...

03:03.283 --> 03:05.410
It's those damned
Wright Brothers!

03:05.451 --> 03:07.316
Their first successful
airplane flight...

03:07.353 --> 03:09.412
took place in Kitty Hawk,
North Carolina.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.753
You're damn right, Rod!
Those sneaky bastards!

03:13.459 --> 03:14.790
Hey, Franklin!

03:14.827 --> 03:18.456
It sure was fun kicking
your sorry ass last week.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.228
And we want
to do it again tonight!

03:21.267 --> 03:24.395
And, by the way,
the match will start right now.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.837
They're doing it again!
They're doing it again!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.864
Jumpin' [Bleep]
on a pogo stick...

03:28.908 --> 03:31.604
the Wright Brothers are taking it
to Benjamin Franklin again!

03:32.946 --> 03:34.277
It's Gandhi!

03:34.314 --> 03:36.077
I can't believe it!
It's Gandhi!

03:36.115 --> 03:38.276
Gandhi's method of nonviolent
conflict resolution...

03:38.318 --> 03:40.809
- was ultimately what got...
- You're damned straight!

03:40.853 --> 03:43.845
Mahatma's gonna resolve
this conflict with a vengeance!

03:43.890 --> 03:47.656
Hellfire! Franklin's
going up for the c-note!

03:47.694 --> 03:48.820
The c-note!

03:48.861 --> 03:52.627
Yeah! Now, that's educational!

03:52.665 --> 03:55.190
Mommy, what color
are the boobies?

03:56.803 --> 03:58.270
Thanks.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.966
I can still see your sac.

04:01.007 --> 04:04.204
Welcome back
to the 19th season of <i>Oprah.</i>

04:04.244 --> 04:07.771
Today, no dream
is too big to fulfill.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.645
What can Oprah do for you?

04:09.682 --> 04:11.309
Me?! Oh! Oh, my!

04:11.351 --> 04:13.080
I'd love a nice
pastrami sandwich.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.280
Check under your chair!

04:18.291 --> 04:19.485
It's good.

04:19.524 --> 04:22.517
Everyone else,
look under your chairs.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.091
Don't open them yet.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.592
Not yet!

04:29.636 --> 04:31.661
What is it? Can I...

04:31.704 --> 04:35.003
Now... open the boxes!

04:35.041 --> 04:37.737
They're keys to a new car!

04:37.777 --> 04:40.905
Everyone gets a new car!

04:44.617 --> 04:48.383
OK, OK. Oprah's got a caller.
What's your wish, sir.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.753
I would like more land
for my people...

04:50.790 --> 04:52.724
land we can be proud of.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.953
You want more land?

04:53.993 --> 04:57.759
How about the entire
Louisiana Purchase!

05:00.967 --> 05:03.265
This will look great
in my casino.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.171
You think that's something?
No dream is too big.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.436
Look out, America,
we're raising the dead...

05:09.475 --> 05:11.568
so you can see
your loved ones again!

05:11.611 --> 05:13.841
All of you who have been
laid to rest...

05:13.880 --> 05:16.542
I want you to rise up!
The power of Oprah!

05:16.582 --> 05:18.379
The big O is coming at ya!

05:18.418 --> 05:20.943
We're almost out of time,
but we can end the show...

05:20.987 --> 05:23.615
with one more dream come true.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.819
Sally, from North Dakota,
what's your dream, little girl?

05:27.994 --> 05:31.623
I'd like Daddy
to stop hurting Mommy.

05:34.634 --> 05:37.797
Arr! What that
steering wheel be?

05:37.837 --> 05:40.328
Arr! It's drivin' me nuts.

05:40.373 --> 05:41.635
See you at the meeting.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.938
Yeah, see you there...
douche.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.982
Uh, oc...
occupied. Occupied.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.298
Uh, hello?! Hello, 911?

06:12.505 --> 06:13.733
I'm in a bathroom!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.803
Oh, wait!

06:46.906 --> 06:50.273
Dumplestiltskin...
a creature not of your world...

06:50.309 --> 06:52.675
but a user of its bathrooms.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.545
When finished,
it leaves behind terror...

06:55.581 --> 07:00.280
terror and a basketball-sized
chocolate mud baby...

07:00.319 --> 07:02.082
from the Twilight Zone.

07:12.532 --> 07:13.863
All right,
let's take a look at...

07:13.900 --> 07:15.492
Good sweet [Bleep]!

07:17.603 --> 07:20.970
You must find my client
not guilty!

07:21.007 --> 07:22.304
Ladies and gentlemen...

07:22.341 --> 07:26.573
you hold the fate of
this young man in your hands.

07:30.049 --> 07:33.212
OK, y'all, the facts
in this here case seem clear...

07:33.252 --> 07:35.743
as a new Ford windshield.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.780
Now, the kid's boss catches him
stealing from the till.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.156
Well, the kid's
gotta shut him up.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.991
No! No! No!

07:44.063 --> 07:46.657
Then the kid ditches the body.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.727
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

07:49.769 --> 07:52.067
- He's, like, totally guilty.
- Bark!

07:52.104 --> 07:53.799
So, let's just vote
this sucker guilty...

07:53.840 --> 07:56.001
and hit the bar! Yee-haw!

07:56.042 --> 07:57.475
- All in favor?
- Aye!

07:57.510 --> 07:59.239
- All opposed?
- Nay.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.404
- An outrage!
- Bogus!

08:00.446 --> 08:03.176
The witness' testimony
was totally unreliable.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.946
Isn't it true that
your mother, sister...

08:05.985 --> 08:08.749
cousin, and aunt
are all the same person?

08:08.788 --> 08:10.915
Ah, duhrr.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.824
I believe the victim's mistress
killed him.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.852
Miss Herring, what was
the last conversation...

08:16.896 --> 08:18.420
you had with the deceased?

08:18.464 --> 08:20.022
I told that greasy mechanic...

08:20.066 --> 08:22.193
if he went back to his wife,
I'd kill him.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.760
- And did he go back to his wife?
- Yes!

08:24.804 --> 08:26.294
- And did you kill him?
- Ye...

08:26.339 --> 08:28.466
Objection! Relevance.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.600
Uh, sustained.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.544
Yeah! Then the five-oh
plant the DMA evidence.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.308
You can't trust the police.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.908
One time a police
take my shoeshine box...

08:37.950 --> 08:41.885
beat me with it.
My lordy!

08:41.921 --> 08:44.515
What? Every black man
on the TV...

08:44.557 --> 08:46.957
gots to be
a posimative role model?

08:46.993 --> 08:51.521
But the DNA evidence
matched 13 out of 13 SDRs.

08:51.564 --> 08:54.192
The defendant's clearly guilty.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.895
Uh, you're a [Bleep] dog.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.097
OK, so let's go over this again.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.970
And that's why we must find
that young man not guilty.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.310
Fine, fine!
How does everyone vote?

09:08.347 --> 09:09.541
Not guilty.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.740
Mr. Foreman, your verdict?

09:12.785 --> 09:14.650
Not guilty.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.678
Justice has been served!

09:16.722 --> 09:19.748
It's my belief that the mistress
is guilty of this crime.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.259
What about the fact
that Miss Herring...

09:21.294 --> 09:23.387
was singing the national anthem
at the World Series...

09:23.429 --> 09:24.794
at the time of the murder?

09:26.132 --> 09:28.259
I told you,
I'd kill any man you loved...

09:28.301 --> 09:31.031
if you wouldn't love me!
Now I'll kill you, too!

09:31.070 --> 09:33.470
- Oh, no!
- No!

09:33.506 --> 09:37.135
Sorry, pal, but you're one wrong
I've just gotta right.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.510
Oh, I wish I had fists.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.781
Jack Beckett, you're charged
with double homicide.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.087
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.185
This is gonna be fun!
Yee-haw!

09:56.228 --> 09:58.594
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

09:58.631 --> 10:00.428
Nobody listened to me before!

10:00.466 --> 10:02.229
Jack must die!

10:04.670 --> 10:09.300
Tune in next time
when every dog has its day.
