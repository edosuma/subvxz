WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:03.235
Prepare to surrender.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.572
Man, I am out
of practice.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.440
We need to start playing
as much as we did

00:08.442 --> 00:09.742
when you were
crashing with me.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.080
Wow.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.432
You do suck today.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.783
Maybe we should go down
to the alley.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.085
Your dad should be here soon.
Don't try to get out

00:20.087 --> 00:22.454
of this butt-whuppin'.
I texted him and I told him

00:22.456 --> 00:24.623
to come up here
to meet us.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.625
Thanks for, uh,
throwing work his way.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.194
He needs the scratch.
It's been a slow couple

00:29.196 --> 00:30.562
of months at his garage.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.330
(door opens)

00:31.332 --> 00:34.166
Hey! Who's winning?

00:34.168 --> 00:35.701
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.536
How are you?
Good.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.205
Cabe, you ready to go check out
your LeMans?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.707
Love them old Pontiacs, huh?

00:41.709 --> 00:43.575
(chuckles)
Actually, I didn't
ask you here

00:43.577 --> 00:46.378
about the car. I, uh...

00:46.380 --> 00:48.647
I need to talk to you
about something else.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.316
I don't understand.
Me either.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.035
What's going on, Cabe?

00:53.036 --> 00:54.753
A few days ago,
I got a call from the FBI.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.456
They arrested Sonny Dubin.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.758
They want me
to convince you

00:59.760 --> 01:00.726
to help them.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.563
Who's Sonny Dubin?

01:07.301 --> 01:08.467
Dad,

01:08.469 --> 01:10.135
who's Sonny Dubin?

01:10.137 --> 01:12.137
He runs a stolen car ring,

01:12.139 --> 01:13.839
and years ago,
when I still drank a lot,

01:13.841 --> 01:17.242
before you were back in my life,
I used to blast VIN numbers

01:17.244 --> 01:20.179
off of vehicles he brought
to me for a few bucks.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.181
His operation has grown
since you worked with him.

01:22.183 --> 01:25.117
He's now using those cars
to smuggle drugs

01:25.119 --> 01:26.752
over the border.
I didn't know anything
about drugs.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.388
I was just wiping VINs.
I know.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.324
But with drugs,
bodies end up in the desert.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.326
Feds want to RICO Dubin.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.128
MR. QUINN:
And they want me to testify.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.329
I don't know anything, Cabe.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.864
The guy would send me cars,
I'd do my thing,

01:38.866 --> 01:40.232
he'd take 'em back--
that was it.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.433
That's all you got to say
in court.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.135
This Dubin guy
kills people,

01:43.136 --> 01:44.836
and you want my dad
to take the stand against him?

01:44.839 --> 01:46.472
Are you crazy?
If he doesn't,

01:46.473 --> 01:48.106
the Feds arrest him,
they put the word out

01:48.109 --> 01:49.508
that he's turning
state's evidence.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.677
Dubin's guys can get
to him in a lockup

01:51.679 --> 01:53.278
a hell of a lot easier
than they can

01:53.280 --> 01:54.413
if he's on the street.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.782
God.
(chuckles)

01:56.784 --> 01:59.251
CABE:
But I worked out a deal.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.153
You cooperate,
you get two years.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.121
Two years?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.422
They transfer you to a prison

02:03.424 --> 02:05.724
out of state.
They give you a fake name.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.292
You'll be safe.
But you have

02:07.294 --> 02:08.861
to self-surrender
by midnight tonight.

02:08.863 --> 02:11.196
You're ambushing him.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.364
I'm trying to help him.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.334
Patrick,

02:15.336 --> 02:16.635
if you don't cooperate,

02:16.637 --> 02:18.137
the Feds will arrest you,

02:18.139 --> 02:20.472
and you'll be incarcerated
without protection.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.476
If you run, the Feds or Dubin's
guys will eventually find you.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.612
Testifying is your only option.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.413
Don't listen
to him.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.249
He's not a genius.
There are other options

02:30.251 --> 02:32.451
that he can't figure out
but I can.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.388
The Feds put you
in a bad spot, huh?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.658
All right.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.294
I don't blame you. I...

02:42.296 --> 02:44.563
I'll take the deal.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.332
I do blame you.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.601
I thought we were friends.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.607
I'll talk to her.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.609
(phone rings)

02:57.611 --> 03:00.846
This is Cabe Gallo.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.182
(whirring)

03:06.654 --> 03:08.253
WALTER:
Do you smell that, Sly?

03:08.255 --> 03:10.455
That's the smell
of ionic polymer metal

03:10.457 --> 03:13.525
composite overheating.
That's the smell of your defeat.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.260
Yeah, well, you smell that?

03:15.262 --> 03:17.663
That is the smell...

03:17.665 --> 03:18.830
of me...

03:18.832 --> 03:20.265
Where's this going?

03:20.267 --> 03:22.534
...beating you.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.469
Why would that have an odor?

03:27.808 --> 03:28.941
<i> That</i> has an odor.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.309
That wasn't supposed to happen.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.310
The victor!

03:31.312 --> 03:32.644
(groans)
No. You didn't pin me.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.679
I just had a malfunction.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.347
Hey, Ralph, can you

03:35.349 --> 03:36.448
help me out with this motor?

03:36.450 --> 03:37.549
I wouldn't be of much service.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.284
I'm a bit distracted today.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.552
What's wrong, buddy?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.554
Something at school.
What is it?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.856
Physics? Calculus?
We can help.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.793
Two girls asked me
to the Valentine's dance.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.495
(whispers):
We can't help.

03:50.497 --> 03:51.763
I don't know who to pick.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.565
I don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.267
All right, let's
break this down.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.436
Did you notice you were
touching your chest

03:57.438 --> 03:59.188
while speaking
to either lady?

03:59.189 --> 04:00.939
That would indicate which gal
most piques your interest.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.408
WALTER: That's an easy
solve. Take them both.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.944
Alternate dancing with them
every other song.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.346
Efficient.
I don't think

04:07.348 --> 04:08.647
they'll like that very much.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.449
Ralph, don't stress.
The probability

04:10.451 --> 04:11.984
of either of these girls
being the one

04:11.986 --> 04:14.286
is very low.
Only two percent

04:14.288 --> 04:15.554
of childhood sweethearts
wind up together.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.789
Sweethearts? What are you guys
chatting about?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.758
Nothing. Sociology.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.293
(horn honking)
Ride's here.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.294
Got to go.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.296
Bye...

04:26.300 --> 04:28.267
What just happened here?
WALTER: Here?

04:28.269 --> 04:29.601
Nothing.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.803
Does Ralph have a sweetheart?
Sorry,

04:31.805 --> 04:32.971
can't answer. Bro Code.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.673
Yeah. Bro Code.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.875
Ow! Ralph got asked
to the Valentine's dance

04:36.877 --> 04:40.012
by two different girls
and he doesn't know what to do!

04:40.014 --> 04:41.831
(gasps)
Why wouldn't

04:41.832 --> 04:43.649
he come to me with this problem?
TOBY: Yeah, boys love

04:43.651 --> 04:44.950
to go to their moms
with girl problems.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.452
And he trusts us
to give sound advice.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.921
About girls? What's next?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.389
You guys gonna teach him
how to play football?

04:50.391 --> 04:51.623
I don't like this.
CABE: Okay,

04:51.625 --> 04:53.659
gather up.
Got a call from the CIA.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.296
That football comment--
that was sarcasm, right?

04:57.298 --> 05:00.732
No, she really thinks you should
teach Ralph how to tackle.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.869
I think that was more sarcasm.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.371
Okay, we got a case coming in
on a secure line

05:06.373 --> 05:09.775
from CIA Agent Harris Markman,
Eastern Europe Desk.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.810
Where's Happy?
She should hear this.
TOBY: She just texted.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.944
She's gonna need a minute.
Something with her dad.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.379
We'll fill her in later.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.514
Only thing they
told me about this

05:15.516 --> 05:17.382
is that it's time-sensitive.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.051
Time-sensitive's
an understatement.
Agent Markman.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.987
Well, we got a good connection.
The floor's yours.
Thank you, sir.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.890
Two weeks ago, a CIA agent
in Sardovia was murdered,

05:24.892 --> 05:27.359
and his jump drive containing
the names of Sardovian nationals

05:27.361 --> 05:28.827
spying for the U.S. was stolen.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.063
These nationals have risked
their lives for years,

05:31.065 --> 05:32.998
feeding us data
on an Eastern Bloc dictatorship

05:33.000 --> 05:35.400
that repeatedly violates
human rights.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.402
The list of their identities
is encrypted,

05:37.404 --> 05:39.905
but the Sardovians have already
managed to break a couple names.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.223
How can you be sure?

05:41.224 --> 05:42.540
Two of our informants
were killed.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.976
Given the rate of decryption,
we suspect they're using

05:44.978 --> 05:46.945
an Enigma-type machine
to crack the code.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.814
A stream cipher,
likely working off

05:48.816 --> 05:51.416
of various algorithms
simultaneously.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.085
MARKMAN:<i> The names on the list</i>
<i> are individually encrypted</i>

05:53.087 --> 05:55.087
<i> for exactly this scenario,</i>
<i> so they have to be cracked</i>

05:55.089 --> 05:57.823
<i> one by one. </i>
SYLVESTER:<i> But if the</i>
<i>encryptions were all generated</i>

05:57.825 --> 05:59.691
<i> by the same program,</i>
<i> as the cipher decodes them,</i>

05:59.693 --> 06:01.626
<i> it'll pick up</i>
<i> on idiosyncrasies</i>

06:01.628 --> 06:03.628
<i> of the programmer,</i>
<i> becoming more efficient.</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:05.097
(beeping)
WALTER:<i> You don't have weeks</i>

06:05.099 --> 06:07.065
to get your contacts out--
you have days, tops.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.001
We've extracted everyone
on the list, except for one.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.470
Natalya Abelev.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.604
The chess grandmaster?

06:12.606 --> 06:13.872
She's ranked first in the world.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.141
Natalya's father, a journalist,

06:16.142 --> 06:18.409
spoke out against the regime,
so they incarcerated him.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.811
He died in prison.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.480
She's been working
with us since.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.715
Her celebrity allows her to meet
with heads of government,

06:23.717 --> 06:26.585
see parts of the nation regular
Sardovians have no access to.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.019
She's been a wealth
of information.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.455
We owe it to Natalya
to keep her safe.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.458
We have to get her a code word,
"green beans."

06:33.460 --> 06:34.993
Code<i> words.</i>

06:34.995 --> 06:37.028
"Green beans" is two words.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.864
Um, yes,

06:38.866 --> 06:40.799
it is. Anyway, that's our signal

06:40.801 --> 06:42.901
for an emergency extraction.
She knows where to meet us.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.537
That sounds easy enough.
What's the catch?

06:45.539 --> 06:46.972
She's been sequestered
by the Sardovian government

06:46.974 --> 06:49.141
ahead of the International
Chess Championship,

06:49.143 --> 06:51.076
which starts tomorrow.
Only people

06:51.077 --> 06:53.010
she interacts with
are her state-sponsored security

06:53.013 --> 06:55.547
and the players
that sit across her board,

06:55.549 --> 06:56.982
from now
until the tournament ends.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.884
Well, if Cipher only has
her encrypted name to solve,

06:58.886 --> 07:00.619
it'll crack it before then.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.621
They'll know she's been spying
for the U.S. They'll kill her.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.123
That's why we need your help.
There are two wild card spots

07:05.125 --> 07:07.592
remaining. We need at least one
of those spots

07:07.594 --> 07:09.060
to go to one of you.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.463
It's an open, online competition

07:11.465 --> 07:12.764
that starts within the hour.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.965
If anybody can win their way

07:13.967 --> 07:15.834
into this tournament
on such short notice,

07:15.836 --> 07:18.170
it's Scorpion.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.505
CABE: They play through the
tournament, reach Natalya,

07:20.507 --> 07:21.940
and pass along the...

07:22.776 --> 07:24.109
...code words.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.011
Then I'll take her safely across
the border.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.113
CABE: When are
we heading out?
Scorpion's booked on a flight

07:28.115 --> 07:30.615
to Sardovia leaving
in two hours.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.150
But, Agent Gallo, we need you
to sit this one out.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.219
Is there a problem?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.021
If fake credentials are spotted,
this all falls apart.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.923
So everyone goes in
as themselves.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.524
Gallo's a federal agent.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.992
They'd never let him
into the country.

07:40.994 --> 07:41.860
Understood.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.061
Have to go now.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.896
I'll see you at the tournament
in 14 hours,

07:44.898 --> 07:46.865
fill you in
on the extraction plan then.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.633
Okay, get online

07:48.635 --> 07:51.136
and one of you win your way
into that tournament.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.540
What's the holdup?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.009
We don't play chess.

07:58.011 --> 07:58.977
Not anymore.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.513
Why the hell not?

08:01.515 --> 08:04.049
Why are we looking
at a coat hook?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.718
That is not a coat hook.
That is a coat rook.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.820
Wound up in this wall
five years ago.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.822
After a weeklong
chess tournament.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.624
A tournament
that went horribly wrong.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.960
You threw a rook in the wall?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.261
Wasn't me.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.196
Nope.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.932
It was a three-way tie
for points.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.134
I was about to engage
a masterful attack,

08:23.136 --> 08:24.569
the Bishop's Gambit,

08:24.571 --> 08:26.972
but then Walter sneezed
on my knight.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.573
It was an accident.
<i> J'accuse!</i>

08:28.575 --> 08:30.709
My knight was covered
in your mucus.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.978
The one piece I needed
just happened to be the one

08:32.980 --> 08:34.813
you doused with your filth.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.948
One, I do not have the ability
to aim my mucus.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.617
Two, you could have cleaned
it off.
Not without

08:38.619 --> 08:40.719
touching it. I played half
the game with a dead pony!

08:40.721 --> 08:43.655
At checkmate, Sly whipped
this rook at Walt's head.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.891
Not a half bad arm.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.559
It was unbecoming.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.827
So we vowed
never to play the game again

08:48.829 --> 08:51.530
for the sake of the team
and our friendship.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.764
PAIGE:
All that over

08:52.766 --> 08:54.199
a board game? Being petty is

08:54.201 --> 08:55.634
no way to live a life.
Chess is not
a board game.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.802
It's the ultimate test
of genius and strategy

08:57.804 --> 08:59.287
since the seventh century.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.771
It's all about probabilities.
After the first three moves,

09:00.774 --> 09:03.108
there's 121 million
possible positions.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.610
Well, it's really a
game of psychology,

09:05.612 --> 09:07.746
anticipating your opponent's
move before he knows himself.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.682
I see. Still a board game.
You can call it
whatever you want.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.051
But it's so intense
Sly has to wear a mouthguard

09:13.053 --> 09:15.320
because he grinds
his teeth when he plays.
Just wait

09:15.322 --> 09:17.055
till you see his victory dance.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.189
All right,
I've heard enough.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.191
We got a woman's life
at risk.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.694
Two of you will play
in that tournament.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.863
I'm out. Chess is
a gateway game.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.848
Start with pawns, wind
up at the poker table.

09:26.849 --> 09:28.832
And Happy doesn't play.
There's no building involved.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.835
All right, Happy can run point
from the garage.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.771
She's taking care of something
with her dad for a little bit.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.340
Walter and Sylvester, you guys
log on to that wild card match

09:35.342 --> 09:36.641
in ten.

09:36.643 --> 09:37.776
PAIGE:
You guys gonna be able

09:37.778 --> 09:39.144
to get your head
in the game by then?

10:32.366 --> 10:35.000
Look at that.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.635
It's quite lifelike,
isn't it?

10:44.244 --> 10:46.244
Hey. Just got to the tournament.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.746
Flight was bumpy.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.981
I'm sorry-- I got a mouth
full of Georgian pizza.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.032
How you doing? When I left

10:51.033 --> 10:52.082
you were kind of off.
I'm just

10:52.085 --> 10:53.218
helping my dad with some stuff.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.686
You know, I was
reading markers on Cabe

10:54.688 --> 10:56.021
when he said you
were with Patrick.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.355
I can tell he's
worried about you.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.091
Cabe doesn't know anything.
I'm fine.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.093
I got to go, okay? Bye.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.664
Don't blame Cabe.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.799
He's trying to help,
there aren't any options.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.968
Not necessarily.
I may have an idea.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.070
Happy, I know this is hard
for you to accept, okay?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.805
I'm going to lockup.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.041
Okay, but that doesn't mean
you have to stay there.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.245
(siren wailing)
How much farther?

11:20.247 --> 11:21.913
End of the block.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.149
Oh, well, I hope your hands
don't freeze in the cold.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.350
Might affect your game.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.985
I could beat you
with my feet.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.953
Hey, look, there's Markman
in front of the tournament hall.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.392
(speaking Russian)

11:37.164 --> 11:38.396
TOBY:
Hey, look,

11:38.398 --> 11:39.998
there's Markman
getting arrested.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.270
Keep moving,
they haven't made us yet.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.406
(siren wailing)

11:48.408 --> 11:50.408
There's an airport
three miles behind us.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.743
Maybe we should
just go home.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.977
Even if we reach
Natalya now,

11:52.979 --> 11:54.479
who are we supposed
to deliver her to?

11:54.481 --> 11:56.214
No Cabe,
no Markman.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.116
Guess we have to
save her on our own.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.251
Thought we were just here
to play chess.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.365
We're at the competition, but we
still have no idea what to do.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.501
We need to get a breakdown
of Markman's extraction plan

12:16.503 --> 12:18.837
from the CIA.
Markman was the only one
who knew the plan

12:18.839 --> 12:21.906
for security purposes, and
as far as the CIA's concerned,

12:21.908 --> 12:23.975
you guys do not exist.
Just get our target

12:23.977 --> 12:25.243
to the Belarus border,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.112
ten miles from the city center.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.980
There's CIA on the ground,
and they'll help.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.249
Just focus on
getting Natalya alone

12:31.251 --> 12:32.383
and smuggling her
over the border.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.818
WALTER:
If they knew of Markman,

12:33.819 --> 12:35.252
for all we know they figured out
Natalya already

12:35.255 --> 12:36.387
and grabbed her as well.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.922
Negative.
There she is.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.161
Well, if they knew
she was a spy,

12:43.163 --> 12:44.813
she'd be arrested,
so they must have

12:44.814 --> 12:46.464
just been on Markman's tail
as a potential infiltrator

12:46.466 --> 12:47.766
and picked him up.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.834
So for now, Natalya's safe.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.469
TOBY:
Look at that security detail.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.372
How do we get her alone?
Ladies' room.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.508
Can't you hold it
until we figure this out?
Her guards

12:56.510 --> 12:57.976
are all male.
They won't follow her

12:57.978 --> 12:59.110
into the ladies' room.
She'll be alone there.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.411
CABE:
Oh, that's a good call.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.080
Whoever winds up
playing Natalya

13:02.082 --> 13:03.448
tells her to head
to the bathroom.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.550
Oh, copy that. I'll tell her.
No.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.019
<i> I'll</i> tell her, because I will
make it to the championship.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.288
Oh, yeah, that's what's
important right now.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.524
Oh, look, everybody's headed
into the competition room.

13:12.526 --> 13:13.525
You putzes go play;
Paige and I'll

13:13.526 --> 13:14.525
figure out
the Natalya of it all.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.060
No comms. People see you

13:16.062 --> 13:17.428
with 'em, they'll think
you're cheating.
Fine,

13:17.430 --> 13:18.496
as someone with my ability

13:18.498 --> 13:19.531
wouldn't need that advantage

13:19.533 --> 13:21.166
anyway.
Mmm, not when you can just

13:21.168 --> 13:23.134
blast 'em with bacteria.
It was dusty.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.170
PAIGE: Focus. This
isn't about the game.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.437
This is about reaching Natalya
as soon as possible.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.306
And you all said it yourselves:
it won't be long

13:28.308 --> 13:30.575
before the decryption machine
cracks her name. Let's go.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.187
Welcome, chess fans,
to the annual

13:42.189 --> 13:44.289
International
Chess Championship.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.057
The best players
in the world

13:46.059 --> 13:48.326
have gathered to compete
for the title.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.894
Take your assigned seat

13:49.896 --> 13:52.263
and prepare for commencement
of the opening round.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.899
Not much competition here.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.435
Bunch of kooks and amateurs.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.204
Case in point:

13:59.206 --> 14:00.405
Chester Perozzi.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.840
He won't play

14:01.842 --> 14:03.508
without his
noise-blocking headset.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.944
He thinks his opponents send
out subliminal audio messages

14:05.946 --> 14:07.478
to disrupt his concentration.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.215
I played him in a juniors
tournament eight years ago.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.150
Wiped the board with him.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.988
Natalya Abelev has just
entered the main stage.

14:16.990 --> 14:20.291
Sardovia's star player is
the reigning queen on the board.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.630
SYLVESTER: She's in pool one,
but we're both in pool two.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.366
And the first chance
we'll get to play her

14:28.368 --> 14:30.368
is in the finals.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.637
May the best man win.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.606
I plan to.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.341
ANNOUNCER:
Players, take your seats.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.177
Round one will begin
in two minutes.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.049
No vents, no windows.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.451
How do we get Natalya
out of here?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.153
Oh, it's too bad she's a she,

14:49.155 --> 14:50.955
there's a big window
in the men's room.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.323
I can't get her out that way.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.259
What are you doing
in the men's room?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.327
Do you really want me
to answer that question?

14:56.329 --> 14:58.229
HAPPY: The women's room
and the men's room

14:58.231 --> 15:00.098
share a wall.
Just cut through and you'll have

15:00.100 --> 15:01.933
a clear exit.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.273
No, that's not an exit
as much as a 40-foot plummet

15:08.275 --> 15:10.074
to her death.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.143
Oh, great, so we're screwed.
TOBY: Not necessarily.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.280
I have an idea. Uh, love bug,

15:15.282 --> 15:16.547
we'll check in with you later.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.950
Paige, it's time to carbo load.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.264
What are those?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.133
They look a lot
like prison specs.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.969
Yeah, well, you look
a lot like a jerk.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.470
Hey, if you're thinking about

15:39.472 --> 15:41.172
hacking into the
jail's network

15:41.174 --> 15:43.308
to help your father,
think again.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.542
Or what, you gonna
arrest me, too?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.711
No, and I know
I can't stop you.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.246
You're smarter than me
and you'd just

15:48.248 --> 15:50.048
figure out a way
to go behind my back.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.115
Like you did to me.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.383
I tried to help your dad

15:52.385 --> 15:54.285
because I care about you.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.455
If you try to spring
him from that place,

15:57.457 --> 15:58.690
it's only gonna
make things worse

15:58.692 --> 16:00.391
when the U.S. marshals
find him.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.593
And they will find him.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.063
You're supposed to be brilliant.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.131
Act like it.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.952
Best of luck.

16:10.953 --> 16:12.670
Luck is a construct
for the untalented, so

16:12.672 --> 16:14.005
let's play chess.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.577
I must break you.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.657
Checkmate.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.729
Checkmate.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.265
Checkmate.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.502
Pleasure.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.709
Checkmate.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.249
Checkmate.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.317
(yawns)

16:59.319 --> 17:00.585
Is this your first time playing?

17:04.457 --> 17:06.457
Checkmate.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.429
I'm stumped.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.197
I got three ways I can beat you,

17:13.199 --> 17:14.599
but I don't know which to use.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.200
Know what,
I'll use the pawn.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.569
They never get to be the hero.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.106
Checkmate.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.376
Well, looks like we're
playing each other next.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.477
And the winner
plays Natalya.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.546
One of us should forfeit.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.348
We have to reach her
before Cipher cracks her name,

17:30.350 --> 17:32.350
and there's no telling
how long our match could take.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.451
That'd be a wise move.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.786
Yeah.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.562
Fine. You want to play?
I have ten minutes to kill.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.731
Know what my nickname was
in chess club?

17:46.733 --> 17:47.732
Susie?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.434
The Chess Vulture.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.802
Because I peck away
at my opponents

17:50.804 --> 17:53.805
until there's nothing left
but a rotting carcass.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.707
That's dumb. Any other bird
would work in that analogy.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.309
I'll gonna call you the Chess...

17:58.311 --> 17:59.777
Ostrich.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.714
That would be wrong,
because I'm the Chess Vulture.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.751
ANNOUNCER:
Will Mr. Dodd and Mr. O'Brien

18:06.753 --> 18:08.119
make their way to
the chessboard?

18:16.696 --> 18:19.097
I got baking soda and more dough
than Warren Buffett.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.566
How goes you?
Okay. I'm going in.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.867
Hey, can I get that

18:22.869 --> 18:25.136
vodka on the rocks, please?

18:35.849 --> 18:38.449
Right under the men's room.
This'll be your landing zone.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.885
Ugh, it stinks.
Yes, it is a Dumpster.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.621
Just help me
put in the ingredients.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.189
Are you sure this is gonna work?

18:45.191 --> 18:46.791
HAPPY: The lemon juice
and baking soda will act

18:46.793 --> 18:50.128
as a rising agent,
only faster and fluffier.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.896
It'll be like landing on
a giant muffin.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.331
And speaking of muffins,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.266
how about our stud muffin
Ralphy-boy, huh?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.268
Two dates,
one dance.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.369
Takes after Uncle Toby.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.288
Yeah, I wouldn't know
much about it,

19:00.289 --> 19:02.206
since he seems to only want to
talk about it with the IQ Crew.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.775
Ralph came to us because
we think like him.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.410
Yeah, about
sciencey stuff.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.212
Matters of the heart
are my territory.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.547
If he doesn't need me for
that, he doesn't need me

19:09.549 --> 19:10.615
for anything at all.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.483
You guys should
stay in your lane.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.919
You're mad at us
for helping your son?

19:14.921 --> 19:18.156
You're the one who said being
petty is no way to live a life.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.625
Don't use my words against me,
I hate that. Okay, I'm done.
All right,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.427
just set it and forget it.
Okay. This gets her out of
the building, now how do we

19:23.429 --> 19:25.796
get her out of the country?
HAPPY (over radio): You guys'll
already be in the Dumpster,

19:25.798 --> 19:26.831
just stay there.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.566
Toby can hot-wire
a garbage truck,

19:28.568 --> 19:30.268
haul away the Dumpster,

19:30.270 --> 19:32.537
have Walt and Sly jump into the
back, and drive into Belarus.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.671
Oh, yeah,

19:33.673 --> 19:34.405
just that easy.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.907
It's a smart plan.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.408
If you guys get stopped,
the guards aren't likely

19:37.410 --> 19:38.676
to dig through the trash.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.912
Now, there is a municipal
vehicle depot

19:40.914 --> 19:42.446
five miles outside of the city.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.515
(digital trilling)

19:46.953 --> 19:48.819
(beeping)

19:48.821 --> 19:50.888
♪ ♪

19:56.396 --> 19:57.562
(whispering):
Walter.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.598
Walter.
What?

20:02.602 --> 20:03.585
(muffled):
Natalya...

20:03.586 --> 20:04.569
(normal voice):
Natalya is about to win.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.937
We need to settle things
up here

20:05.939 --> 20:08.439
so one of us can go
sit across from her ASAP.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.274
Fine. You forfeit.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.976
You're losing anyway.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.978
One, I am not losing.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.714
You are falling into
a classic Monticelli trap

20:16.716 --> 20:18.683
and you don't even
see it, and two,

20:18.685 --> 20:20.251
I'm a Grandmaster.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.787
If anyone should forfeit,
it is you.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.591
It appears Dodd and O'Brien are
having words with each other.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.726
One can only imagine
the advanced

20:28.728 --> 20:30.461
psychological gamesmanship

20:30.463 --> 20:33.331
these two skilled players
must be engaged in.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.866
The Chess Raven, the Chess
Possum, the Chess Weasel.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.435
Any one of those
is better than

20:37.437 --> 20:39.003
the Chess Vulture.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.972
Fermented fish is disgusting;
everybody thinks so.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.874
Right, well, Super Fun Guy
is dumb.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.776
Who fights crime with
a rubber chicken?

20:45.778 --> 20:46.777
No one.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.613
Super Dumb Guy.

20:48.615 --> 20:52.617
Still smarter than playing chess
without a bishop.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.985
Ooh. That's right.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.653
That just happened.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.721
Caw!

20:59.259 --> 21:01.292
Oh.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.398
(sighs)

21:07.400 --> 21:09.734
Okay, Happy,
I'm staring at a solid wall.

21:09.736 --> 21:10.968
How do I get through it?

21:10.970 --> 21:13.004
It's Cold War era,
Soviet bloc construction.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.373
It is cheap sheetrock
that is most likely weak

21:15.375 --> 21:16.774
from decades of water damage.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.043
Just crack the shell
and peel that egg!

21:19.045 --> 21:21.312
(sighs)
With what?

21:22.682 --> 21:25.783
(sighs)

21:25.785 --> 21:28.586
$200.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.988
(sighs)

21:32.859 --> 21:34.859
I don't know about this.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.911
It's simple.

21:36.912 --> 21:38.962
After you self-surrender,
they process you in this room.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.699
You see the emergency exit
to the right of the desk?

21:41.701 --> 21:43.634
As soon as the clerk
goes to the back

21:43.636 --> 21:45.069
to catalog all
your personal effects,

21:45.071 --> 21:46.537
I'll turn off the alarm.

21:46.539 --> 21:47.738
When the light

21:47.740 --> 21:49.373
above the door
switches off, you walk.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.958
I'll leave

21:50.959 --> 21:52.542
a cuff key under a brick
in the alley outside.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.378
I don't know, Happy.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.414
You'll need to get as big
a head start as possible.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.815
Have a lot of
personal effects on you

21:57.817 --> 21:59.050
so the clerk will take a while

21:59.052 --> 22:00.685
to enter all of them
into the system.

22:00.687 --> 22:01.886
This could go very bad.

22:01.888 --> 22:02.920
They won't catch you.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.557
Just leave the junker
at the corner

22:06.559 --> 22:07.825
with the keys under the mat.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.610
You can get to the border
in a few hours.

22:09.611 --> 22:11.394
Okay, what if they trace it
back to you? Then what?

22:11.397 --> 22:12.797
They won't.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.800
Dad, unless you want to go
to prison, you need to trust me.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.903
I need to take a walk.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.972
I need to think.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.641
Okay.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.043
But I just got you back
in my life.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.878
I don't want to lose you now.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.717
ANNOUNCER:
Natalya Abelev appears
to be no more

22:32.719 --> 22:34.985
than one move away
from a spot in the finals.

22:34.987 --> 22:38.122
Meanwhile, the Americans
continue to lock horns.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.126
(whispers):
That's a move
you're gonna want back.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.595
But as my Uncle Hortance

22:44.597 --> 22:47.665
always said,
"You can't untoast bread."

22:47.667 --> 22:48.866
What was his other expression?

22:48.868 --> 22:50.468
Oh, yeah.
"You're a loser, O'Brien."

22:50.470 --> 22:52.470
(sneezes loudly)

22:52.472 --> 22:54.638
(groans)

22:54.640 --> 22:57.041
You did it again!
Son of a butcher!

22:57.043 --> 22:58.409
I think I'm

22:58.411 --> 23:00.478
coming down with a cold.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.879
I knew it!

23:01.881 --> 23:05.783
You just have to be the best
at everything, don't you?!

23:05.785 --> 23:07.752
You couldn't let me have
this one thing!

23:07.754 --> 23:10.521
Oh, I suggest you regain
your composure and make a move.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.822
We have a case to complete.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.824
Unless, of course,
you can't continue playing

23:13.826 --> 23:15.159
for some reason.

23:15.161 --> 23:18.662
Your jejune antics
are sadly not surprising,

23:18.664 --> 23:21.632
so I came prepared.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.401
(clears throat)

23:23.403 --> 23:25.770
Checkmate goes to...

23:25.772 --> 23:27.405
the Chess Vulture!

23:27.407 --> 23:30.641
Caw-caw! Caw-caw! Caw-caw!

23:30.643 --> 23:32.410
All right.
Caw-caw!

23:32.411 --> 23:34.178
Sylvester Dodd is moving
on to the finals!

23:34.180 --> 23:36.580
Caw-caw! Caw-caw!
And he seems to be engaged

23:36.582 --> 23:38.983
in some kind of victory ritual.
Caw-caw!

23:38.985 --> 23:40.651
Ca...
WOMAN:
Mr. Dodd?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.653
I'm the official scorer
for the tournament.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.189
And you would like an autograph?

23:45.191 --> 23:46.624
Absolutely.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.058
WOMAN:
I hate to be
the bearer of such news,

23:48.060 --> 23:49.794
but you disrupted
the board before

23:49.796 --> 23:51.195
it could be certified.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.864
Under international rules,
you are disqualified.

23:53.866 --> 23:54.965
Huh?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.700
(panting)

23:56.702 --> 23:58.969
You heard the woman.
You broke the rules.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.805
You lose. Madam,
I am ready

24:00.807 --> 24:02.740
to play for the championship.
I am so

24:02.742 --> 24:04.625
sorry, Mr. O'Brien.

24:04.626 --> 24:06.509
Technical disqualification
does not erase your loss

24:06.512 --> 24:07.745
to Mr. Dodd.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.746
So,

24:08.748 --> 24:10.181
Mr. Perozzi will ascend

24:10.183 --> 24:12.583
to the championship round.
(Sylvester gasps)

24:12.585 --> 24:15.686
ANNOUNCER:
In an unprecedented
turn of events,

24:15.688 --> 24:18.456
Chester Perozzi will now
be playing Natalya Abelev

24:18.458 --> 24:19.490
for the title!

24:19.492 --> 24:20.791
Now neither of us will sit

24:20.793 --> 24:22.560
across from Natalya.
We have

24:22.562 --> 24:24.094
no way to get
the message to her.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.564
We checkmated ourselves.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.472
ANNOUNCER:
You can see right here
on the replay

24:34.474 --> 24:36.173
few pieces survived
the impact.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.641
Just a black eye

24:37.643 --> 24:38.676
for the game of chess.

24:38.678 --> 24:39.977
Not good.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.481
Well, what's not good?
HAPPY:
Those idiots

24:43.483 --> 24:45.483
just got themselves
kicked out of the tournament.
WALTER: Guys?

24:45.485 --> 24:46.684
Chester Perozzi is set
to play Natalya.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.886
We have no way
to get to her now.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.789
Well, whatever you two did,
undo it. You need to get back

24:51.791 --> 24:53.157
to the tournament
and give Natalya the code word.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.758
Why are you whispering?

24:54.760 --> 24:55.893
'Cause the only thing

24:55.895 --> 24:56.894
separating me
from the men's room is

24:56.896 --> 24:58.162
a thin layer of shoddy Soviet

24:58.164 --> 24:59.930
workmanship, and I think
it's best that nobody

24:59.932 --> 25:01.415
hear me.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.899
That's how we get Perozzi
out of the tournament--

25:02.902 --> 25:04.835
with something no one can hear.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.769
We use infrasound on him.
Toby, can that work?

25:06.772 --> 25:08.772
Theoretically,
but you'd have to be precise.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.541
What's infrasound?
TOBY:
Sound waves

25:10.543 --> 25:12.009
emitted at a frequency lower

25:12.011 --> 25:14.211
than what humans
can consciously hear.

25:14.213 --> 25:18.249
It causes adverse reactions:
vertigo, nausea, panic.

25:18.251 --> 25:21.151
He's gonna want
to get out of that room ASAP,

25:21.153 --> 25:22.620
which'll get him disqualified.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.088
SYLVESTER:
And Walter is next in line

25:24.090 --> 25:25.689
to play Natalya.
Right.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.791
We just have to hack
Chester's Bluetooth headphones

25:27.793 --> 25:29.193
and upload
an infrasound audio file.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.661
TOBY:
To disrupt the guy's

25:30.663 --> 25:32.229
autonomic nervous system,

25:32.230 --> 25:33.796
you're gonna want to isolate
everything below 20 hertz.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.734
We're on it. Let's go.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.220
(truck engine starts)

25:56.222 --> 25:58.322
Look what I learned
from my main squeeze.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.559
(speaks indistinctly)

26:03.829 --> 26:06.163
I have hacked
Perozzi's headset.

26:06.165 --> 26:09.600
And I have isolated the
infrasound from a tiger's roar.

26:09.602 --> 26:11.835
It's known to cause
paralysis in humans.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.270
I'm sending you the file now.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.239
Okay. Got it.
(phone chimes)

26:15.241 --> 26:17.575
Sending it off to Perozzi.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.648
(speaking Russian)

26:25.585 --> 26:26.951
It's working.

26:26.953 --> 26:29.053
SYLVESTER:
He looks awful.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.220
(groans)

26:30.222 --> 26:32.856
Mr. Perozzi?
Mr. Perozzi?!

26:32.858 --> 26:33.991
ANNOUNCER:
A stunning

26:33.993 --> 26:35.225
turn of events!

26:35.227 --> 26:36.727
Perozzi has left the stage,

26:36.729 --> 26:38.729
apparently quite ill,

26:38.731 --> 26:39.930
forfeiting his position!

26:39.932 --> 26:42.032
He's heading
to the bathroom! Paige,

26:42.034 --> 26:44.001
stop breaking the wall!

26:48.074 --> 26:49.807
(vomiting)
God.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.842
What did you do to the guy?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.844
TOBY:
<i> He'll be fine.</i>
<i> We're the ones in trouble.</i>

26:53.846 --> 26:55.496
We're running out of time!

26:55.497 --> 26:57.147
That cipher machine can't have
much longer to go.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.883
(trilling, beeping)

27:01.020 --> 27:02.119
MR. QUINN:
Happy?

27:03.356 --> 27:06.357
Hey. You ready to do this?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.627
What are these?

27:09.629 --> 27:11.629
Keys to my garage
and tow truck.

27:11.631 --> 27:12.963
If you could run the engine
once in while

27:12.965 --> 27:15.800
so it doesn't seize up,
I'd appreciate it.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.636
Because you'll be locked up, or
because you'll take my offer?

27:18.638 --> 27:20.304
(door opens)

27:20.306 --> 27:22.906
Guys.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.708
You here for your prisoner?

27:24.710 --> 27:27.978
Patrick, we need
to be there by midnight.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.146
Those were the terms.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.781
Yeah, I understand.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.182
And I hate to do this,

27:32.184 --> 27:34.184
but regulation says
I need to cuff you

27:34.186 --> 27:35.786
to bring you in.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.921
Can I have a moment
with my daughter?

27:37.923 --> 27:39.156
Sure.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.191
Thanks.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.727
(quietly):
The door will open.

27:43.729 --> 27:45.329
I'll have the
truck at the corner.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.398
Keys under the mat.

27:49.702 --> 27:52.036
You need to walk me
down the aisle.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.884
(handcuffs clicking)

28:18.030 --> 28:20.764
(door slams shut)

28:20.766 --> 28:22.366
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentleman,

28:22.367 --> 28:23.967
the championship match
is about to commence.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.969
Overhead microphones
will be turned on

28:25.971 --> 28:28.038
above their board
so every aspect

28:28.040 --> 28:29.973
of the gamesmanship
can be experienced.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.909
Guys, they have mics
on the match!

28:31.911 --> 28:34.044
Walter can't tell Natalya
to head to the bathroom

28:34.046 --> 28:36.246
without everyone hearing,
including her security!

28:36.248 --> 28:37.848
Well, I am knee-deep in drywall,

28:37.850 --> 28:39.149
Toby's in a stolen
garbage truck,

28:39.151 --> 28:40.250
and there is a

28:40.252 --> 28:41.819
chess nerd barfing
his brains out.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.220
We're in too deep to quit.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.788
Walter will think of something.

28:44.790 --> 28:48.058
I've really enjoyed
my visit to Sardovia.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.727
It's a beautiful nation.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.195
I've grown very
fond of the food.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.131
Gregorian pizza,
fresh vegetables,

28:54.133 --> 28:56.900
rhubarb, beets...

28:56.902 --> 28:58.402
green beans.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.740
(clock clicks)

29:05.010 --> 29:07.277
There's much to love
about our cuisine.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.214
I know a great spot
to get green beans,

29:10.216 --> 29:11.882
always fresh.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.818
The players are oddly chatty
during this final round.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.920
Much discussion about produce.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.288
Yes, I am aware
of that spot,

29:18.290 --> 29:21.125
but I know a place
with fresher options.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.026
It's so good, it really
is the only option.

29:26.465 --> 29:27.931
What's he doing now?

29:27.933 --> 29:29.166
He just moved a knight to C3,

29:29.168 --> 29:30.400
and faced it outwards,

29:30.402 --> 29:32.102
towards the numbers.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.504
Why? Is that a chess thing?
TOBY: No,

29:33.506 --> 29:35.405
it's a checkers thing.
Of course it's a chess thing!

29:35.407 --> 29:37.274
The knight is facing sideways

29:37.276 --> 29:39.376
in space C3-- he's telling her
to look at that space

29:39.378 --> 29:40.878
from a different angle.

29:40.880 --> 29:44.314
Because from a side angle,
that 3 looks like a "W."

29:44.316 --> 29:46.116
That gives you W.C.,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.451
short in Europe
for "water closet."

29:47.453 --> 29:48.819
Which means bathroom, I got it.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.954
Let's just hope
Natalya does, too.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.324
WALTER: I don't
know what to do.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.927
There's so many ways
to look at this move.

30:02.067 --> 30:04.001
Finish your move already.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.070
(clock clicks)

30:10.142 --> 30:11.175
(clock clicks)

30:11.177 --> 30:12.810
(clock clicks)

30:12.812 --> 30:14.011
(clock clicks)

30:15.514 --> 30:17.481
(clock clicks)

30:17.483 --> 30:19.516
(clock clicks)
Checkmate.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.419
ANNOUNCER:
That's it!

30:22.421 --> 30:23.987
It's over!

30:23.989 --> 30:26.123
Natalya Abelev has
defended her title

30:26.125 --> 30:28.525
in what may go down as

30:28.527 --> 30:30.160
the oddest championship
match we've ever seen!

30:32.865 --> 30:35.232
(speaks Russian)

30:35.968 --> 30:38.101
(speaks Russian)

30:38.103 --> 30:40.170
(cipher pings)

30:56.388 --> 30:57.588
(applause)

30:57.590 --> 30:59.189
What's happening?
Is she headed this way?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.324
Yes, but it's
too crowded.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.025
We're beginning to
lose sight of her.

31:02.027 --> 31:06.096
(sirens blaring)

31:06.098 --> 31:08.899
You're not the only ones
looking for her.

31:13.639 --> 31:14.938
<i> I think it's safe to say</i>

31:14.940 --> 31:16.273
the cipher has cracked the code

31:16.274 --> 31:17.607
and the state police
are after our chess queen.

31:17.610 --> 31:19.510
Walter!

31:19.511 --> 31:21.411
I am alone in a damn bathroom
and I need to know

31:21.413 --> 31:23.013
if Natalya is headed this way
because this place

31:23.015 --> 31:24.882
is crawling with cops
and if we can't save her,

31:24.884 --> 31:26.216
we need to at least
save ourselves.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.084
Green beans?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.452
Oh, yes!
Green beans!

31:28.454 --> 31:30.120
Totally green beans!
Guys, I got her!

31:30.122 --> 31:32.155
Toby, get that truck
in the alley now. Stand back.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.625
(grunts)

31:34.627 --> 31:36.493
Okay. Okay.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.162
Okay, slide
under that door.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.233
(coughs and pants)
PAIGE:
Uh...

31:43.235 --> 31:44.668
Don't mind us. Feel better.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.603
(coughing)

31:46.605 --> 31:47.604
(Perozzi vomits)

31:47.606 --> 31:49.273
Okay, we need to jump.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.540
NATALYA:
What's in there?

31:50.542 --> 31:52.409
Dumpster bread.
It'll break our fall.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.277
Theoretically.
(pounding on door
and yelling in Russian)

31:54.280 --> 31:55.345
They're in the
ladies room!

31:55.347 --> 31:56.513
Come on,
time to go!

31:58.517 --> 31:59.583
You can do it.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.588
(Natalya groans)

32:06.558 --> 32:09.159
(quietly):
Okay.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.260
Oh!

32:10.262 --> 32:11.328
(door breaks open)

32:19.672 --> 32:21.405
Order of bread, coming up!

32:21.407 --> 32:24.241
(policemen continue
yelling in Russian)

32:24.243 --> 32:26.944
They saw us.
Walt, our cover's blown.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.080
We need to pick you boys up

32:30.082 --> 32:31.381
and get over the border, stat.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.150
We're on the street,
headed to the southeast corner

32:33.152 --> 32:34.484
of Alexandra Plaza.

32:35.688 --> 32:39.222
(sirens wailing)

32:42.161 --> 32:43.327
We have company.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.962
HAPPY:
Guys, you need a plan.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.163
A garbage truck from the 80s

32:46.165 --> 32:47.230
does not have the horsepower
to outrun

32:47.232 --> 32:48.599
a fleet of cop cars.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.967
We need a knight block;
separate the cop cars

32:49.969 --> 32:51.101
from the trash truck.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.369
That'll only give us
a small head start.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.570
They'll catch up.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.973
What we need is
a queen's swap;

32:55.975 --> 32:57.140
a classic
slight of hand

32:57.142 --> 32:58.976
to get Natalya out
of the Dumpster.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.179
Only Natalya? Nice try,
but if we're sacrificing a pawn,

33:02.181 --> 33:03.180
it ain't gonna be me!

33:03.182 --> 33:04.181
But I'm right.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.799
Really?
Who got to the finals?

33:05.800 --> 33:07.416
PAIGE: Wha-- shut up!
You've been fighting all day.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.252
so block a knight,
swap a queen, sacrifice a pawn,

33:09.254 --> 33:10.621
whatever, just do it now.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.989
TOBY: Even if we get away
from the cops,

33:11.991 --> 33:13.457
how are we gonna
get over the border

33:13.459 --> 33:15.325
in a garbage truck that's on
every alert in the country?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.461
You don't go over the border,
you go under it.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.429
Remember, the city center's
only ten miles

33:19.431 --> 33:21.431
away from the border,
and during the Cold War,

33:21.433 --> 33:23.467
Soviet nations
shared infrastructure.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.702
I'm looking up sewer plans

33:25.704 --> 33:27.204
for the capital of Sardovia.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.039
Okay, got it.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.741
Pipes go right under
the border into Belarus.

33:30.743 --> 33:33.043
If you drop into the pipes
at Gruschev Tunnel,

33:33.045 --> 33:34.544
you can walk right
out of Sardovia, unseen.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.046
Toby, where are you now?

33:36.048 --> 33:38.248
Half a mile from
Alexandra Plaza.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.449
You need to circle back
here fast.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.800
(tires screech)

34:01.440 --> 34:03.173
(yells in Russian)

34:05.077 --> 34:07.811
(sirens wailing)

34:11.550 --> 34:13.450
(policeman speaking in Russian)

34:38.177 --> 34:41.211
(speaking Russian)

35:01.266 --> 35:03.166
(speaking in Russian)

35:12.377 --> 35:15.312
Hey! You guys
all right?

35:15.314 --> 35:16.480
You find us a lift
once we hit Belarus?

35:16.482 --> 35:17.965
Walter's on the phone
with Cabe.

35:17.966 --> 35:19.449
CABE: Thought you were driving
over the border.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.318
How'd you end up
in the sewer?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.520
Sly and I knew we had to
come up with something.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.122
Something bold that would
eliminate our attackers,

35:25.124 --> 35:26.756
but preserve our pieces.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.258
So we both thought of
the Bishop's Gambit

35:28.260 --> 35:29.259
at the same time.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.494
It's a three-move
strategy;

35:30.496 --> 35:32.262
the knight blocks,
the queen is swapped out

35:32.264 --> 35:33.763
and a pawn is sacrificed.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.533
And our first move was a knight
block to cut off the cop cars.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.168
Thank you.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.802
(speaks Russian)
TOBY:
<i> When I saw the horse statutes</i>

35:39.805 --> 35:40.904
earlier in the day,

35:40.906 --> 35:42.739
<i> I noticed the legs</i>
<i> were oxidizing</i>

35:42.741 --> 35:45.242
<i> and cracked from cheap</i>
<i> bronze-magnesium alloy.</i>

35:45.244 --> 35:46.576
The magnesium
burns quickly,

35:46.578 --> 35:48.612
especially when mixed with
the potassium chlorate

35:48.614 --> 35:50.547
<i> found in the sparklers</i>
<i> being sold</i>

35:50.549 --> 35:52.782
<i> by the street vendors</i>
<i> to tourists.</i>

35:52.784 --> 35:54.885
<i> As heat weakened the metal at</i>
<i> the base, the horses fell.</i>

35:56.255 --> 35:57.755
(tires screech)

35:57.756 --> 35:59.256
Next we needed to get
out of the Dumpster.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.390
That was the queen swap.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.826
I am destroying
these shoes today.

36:03.896 --> 36:06.596
(both grunting)

36:07.833 --> 36:09.666
<i> The fallen horses gave us</i>
<i> a 15-second window</i>

36:09.668 --> 36:12.435
<i> to get out of the</i>
<i> truck without being seen.</i>

36:18.277 --> 36:20.243
TOBY:<i> Next part was</i>
<i> the pawn sacrifice,</i>

36:20.245 --> 36:22.579
<i> starring yours truly</i>
<i> as the pawn.</i>

36:22.581 --> 36:25.549
<i> Cops were after their queen,</i>
<i> so I knew they'd ignore me.</i>

36:27.386 --> 36:29.553
But my sacrifice
wasn't too risky

36:29.555 --> 36:32.923
<i> because I had the lovely</i>
<i> and talented Happy Quinn</i>

36:32.925 --> 36:35.625
<i> directing me to the nearest</i>
<i> drain capable of receiving</i>

36:35.627 --> 36:37.694
<i> my lithe, fit body.</i>

36:37.696 --> 36:38.862
(phone chimes)

36:38.864 --> 36:40.397
Just got a text from Homeland.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.765
Walt, they'll be sending you

36:41.767 --> 36:44.234
the rendezvous coordinates
in Belarus.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.272
You are the oddest bunch of
agents I've ever worked with.

36:49.274 --> 36:50.707
We get that a lot.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.409
Are you okay?

36:52.411 --> 36:53.843
I'm leaving my country.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.212
Forever.

36:55.214 --> 36:56.913
Why did you, uh,
risk all of this?

36:56.915 --> 36:58.481
You were living
the life there

36:58.483 --> 37:00.717
and you're a
national treasure.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.453
My father died in the
Gulag when I was 12

37:03.455 --> 37:06.323
because he was a reporter
who spread the truth.

37:06.325 --> 37:10.727
I owed it to him
to finish his mission.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.862
I missed him so much.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.297
Chess was my refuge.

37:14.299 --> 37:15.999
There's no emotion
in chess,

37:16.001 --> 37:18.301
just math and strategy.

37:18.303 --> 37:20.003
So it was more
than a board game?

37:20.005 --> 37:21.972
It was a good place
to hide

37:21.974 --> 37:24.908
until I learned that when
it comes to people you love,

37:24.910 --> 37:27.477
sometimes there's no refuge.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.913
Sometimes there's just pain.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.815
WALTER: Just heard
from our CIA contact.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.684
When we meet them,
our code words

37:34.686 --> 37:37.554
are "Pea Pod."

37:37.556 --> 37:39.823
These guys love vegetables.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.565
♪ ♪

38:06.818 --> 38:08.385
HAPPY:
Okay, Dad.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.619
Here we go.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.720
(door clicks)

38:13.525 --> 38:15.592
Come on, Dad.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.428
I love you, sweetheart.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.968
(sobs quietly)

38:31.510 --> 38:33.643
(groaning)

38:35.947 --> 38:37.480
Happy?

38:37.482 --> 38:39.616
(crying):
You glad?!

38:41.687 --> 38:43.887
You got what you wanted?!

38:43.889 --> 38:45.755
You know I didn't.

38:50.429 --> 38:53.830
I'm looking at a friend,

38:53.832 --> 38:56.833
a really good friend,

38:56.835 --> 38:58.635
whose heart is breaking.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.573
And I'm just wishing
I could've done more.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.376
(sobbing)

39:07.112 --> 39:09.379
I'm sorry, kid.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.118
(softly):
I'm so sorry, kid.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.756
I'm so sorry.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.528
RALPH:
Guys, I need some advice.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.898
Green brings out my eyes,
but purple makes me look older.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.377
Uh, Ralphy, uh...

39:40.379 --> 39:41.811
let's talk for a second.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.749
Do you remember
your first microscope?

39:45.751 --> 39:48.418
Sure, Mom sent in box tops
from my Fruity Moons.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.153
I loved it.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.887
But later, you graduated
to other microscopes.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.790
At which point you
probably put the first one

39:53.792 --> 39:55.158
in the back of
your closet.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.760
Nope, I tossed that
piece of junk.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.027
WALTER:
Right.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.896
'Cause as you get older,
you'll start to connect

39:59.898 --> 40:02.031
to the things that meld with
your unique intellect better.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.500
Just like we all did.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.701
TOBY:
Hey, Ralph,

40:04.703 --> 40:05.902
uh, you can't treat your mom

40:05.904 --> 40:07.570
like your first microscope, kid.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.673
And you've kind of
been doing that.

40:10.675 --> 40:13.943
But my mom's not a piece of
junk, my mom's great.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.979
Right, so make sure she knows
you feel that way, okay, buddy?

40:19.918 --> 40:20.984
WALTER:
Hmm.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.655
Who'd ever think I'd be giving
emotional advice to a genius?

40:25.657 --> 40:27.857
It's the blind
leading the blind.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.595
Why don't you
eat something?

40:34.199 --> 40:35.732
You look miserable.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.668
I am.

40:38.670 --> 40:39.669
How's Happy holding up?

40:39.671 --> 40:41.738
She's resting.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.506
I'm gonna go see her now.

40:43.508 --> 40:46.609
You know, I tried every move
I could with the Feds.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.678
Pulled every favor,

40:48.680 --> 40:51.481
used every strategy.

40:51.483 --> 40:53.850
And in the end, I still wound up
with that sweet kid

40:53.852 --> 40:55.718
crying in my arms.

40:56.822 --> 41:00.056
'Cause strategy is for games,
like chess.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.927
I heard Natalya say

41:03.929 --> 41:05.829
that sometimes, when it comes
to the people we love,

41:05.831 --> 41:07.464
there's no refuge.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.899
Sometimes there's just pain.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.835
Happy's gonna get
through this pain,

41:11.837 --> 41:13.203
if we help her.

41:13.205 --> 41:15.672
But now she has no father.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.741
Eh, not exactly,
she's got you.

41:19.778 --> 41:20.777
We all do.

41:20.779 --> 41:21.978
We, uh...

41:21.980 --> 41:24.914
we got the guy who
always has our back.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.526
RALPH:
Mom?

41:36.528 --> 41:38.595
I really need your
help with the dance.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.263
You do?

41:40.265 --> 41:42.265
It seems at these
things they use

41:42.267 --> 41:45.869
the word "dance" as a verb,
as well as a noun.

41:45.871 --> 41:48.705
And I don't know
how to do the verb.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.840
You want me to
teach you to dance?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.041
If you have time.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.393
(chuckles softly)

41:53.394 --> 41:54.744
Okay, I have the
perfect CD at home.

41:54.746 --> 41:55.845
We can practice all night.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.913
Ooh!

41:56.915 --> 41:58.114
Bye, guys, see you tomorrow.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.115
Bye.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.850
(quietly):
Hey, hey.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.018
Good boy.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.790
(door closes)

42:07.792 --> 42:09.893
And then there were two.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.899
Are you sure
you want to do this?

42:15.901 --> 42:18.034
You have to remember,
you play great,

42:18.036 --> 42:20.003
but I'm a great player.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.204
You ready?

42:21.206 --> 42:22.906
Absolutely.

42:22.908 --> 42:25.174
And for the record,

42:25.176 --> 42:27.844
I sneezed on purpose.

42:29.915 --> 42:30.980
Son of a bi...
