WEBVTT

00:03.481 --> 00:05.440
[Molly]
Really proud of how well you've
been sticking to your diet.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.529
Well, since you're dead set
on me wearing a white tux

00:07.616 --> 00:09.618
at the wedding, I'd rather look
more like a refrigerator

00:09.705 --> 00:11.272
than a milk truck.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.274
Uh, I've changed my mind
about the white tux.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.015
Let's just go basic black.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.494
Then what are we doing
at an OA meeting?

00:16.581 --> 00:19.106
Let's go get pie.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.542
Since we're talking
about the wedding

00:20.629 --> 00:22.761
I wanted to discuss
our vows with you.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.198
I know, you don't want
to say "obey."

00:24.285 --> 00:27.418
No, I do not. I do,
however, want you to say it.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.508
Yes, sir.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.467
Seriously, though,
I-I thought, you know

00:32.554 --> 00:34.121
instead of doing
the traditional "I dos"

00:34.208 --> 00:36.819
it might be fun
if we write our vows.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.995
Fun for who?
That sounds like a nightmare.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.041
No, it could be really sweet.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.303
Saying what's in our heart

00:42.390 --> 00:44.000
expressing our love in front of

00:44.087 --> 00:45.958
all our friends and family.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.090
That's exactly
what I was picturing

00:47.177 --> 00:49.701
when I said "nightmare."

00:49.788 --> 00:51.790
Come on. What's the big deal?

00:51.877 --> 00:53.357
There's plenty of time
between now and then

00:53.444 --> 00:55.011
to jot down
a few heartfelt sentiments

00:55.098 --> 00:58.667
about how much
I dazzle you each day.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.712
Uh, easy for you,
you were an English lit major.

01:00.799 --> 01:01.974
I'm about one head bump away

01:02.062 --> 01:03.759
from being a member
of the plant family.

01:05.108 --> 01:08.416
Technically, it's
the plant "kingdom""

01:08.503 --> 01:11.114
I goes, it goes kingdom,
phylum, class, order

01:11.201 --> 01:12.289
family, genus, species.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.899
Wedding's off.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.645
- Hey, kids!
- Hey.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.125
Hey, Harry.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.301
You guys notice anything
different about me?

01:24.388 --> 01:26.738
Hint, I have
three-and-a-half less of them.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.088
[imitates a buzzer]
What are pounds?

01:28.175 --> 01:30.133
That is correct.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.266
What happened? Little slow on
the buzzer, brainiac?

01:33.876 --> 01:39.229
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:39.316 --> 01:42.841
♪ I see love ♪♪

01:52.199 --> 01:53.156
[instrumental music]

01:53.243 --> 01:54.679
That was a great OA meeting.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.378
Yeah. Did you see the look
on their fat, little faces

01:57.465 --> 01:59.641
when I said I dropped
three-and-a-half pounds?

02:01.077 --> 02:03.123
Did they look
anything like ours?

02:04.559 --> 02:07.170
I'm sorry.
I'm kind of on a low-carb high.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.739
I went down
an entire belt hole today.

02:10.826 --> 02:13.611
One of the original holes
or one you punched yourself?

02:15.047 --> 02:16.397
Original.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.791
Good for you.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.447
More free refills on coffee
or does one of you

02:23.534 --> 02:26.015
big spenders
wanna splurge on a tea bag?

02:26.842 --> 02:29.453
Top me off, Benson.

02:29.540 --> 02:32.152
You OA people never eat,
do you?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.631
At least not when
there are witnesses.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.329
Am I right, Mike B.?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.289
Listen, now that I've dropped
all this weight

02:39.376 --> 02:41.944
and gotten a handle
on my combination skin

02:42.031 --> 02:45.208
I'm thinking it's time to dip
my toe back in the love pond.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.255
Aw. Well, that's great.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.953
I'm sure there's
a nice girl out there for you.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.824
Assuming that's what you mean

02:52.911 --> 02:55.131
by "toe" and "pond."

02:57.133 --> 02:58.352
The one I've got my eye on

02:58.439 --> 03:01.268
is very nice and sweet

03:01.355 --> 03:04.314
and stacked like
a sleeve of Oreos.

03:07.709 --> 03:11.016
Well, be careful. You don't
wanna date out of your league.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.018
Why not? You did.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.022
Just watch out, Harry.

03:17.109 --> 03:18.415
You been doing
really good on your diet

03:18.502 --> 03:20.112
and you don't wanna end up
brokenhearted

03:20.200 --> 03:22.767
and only leaving the house to
chase down an ice cream truck.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.467
Oh, I've never been that bad.

03:26.554 --> 03:30.122
Besides, if you lay down
in the road, they have to stop.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.214
[instrumental music]

03:35.650 --> 03:37.782
Since when did it become
a crime for a man

03:37.869 --> 03:40.959
to urinate in a public fountain?

03:41.046 --> 03:44.441
I'm guessing about three days
after they invented fountains.

03:44.528 --> 03:47.139
Well, they should put up
a sign or something.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.404
Not just blindside us
with these crazy laws.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.014
Pipe down!

03:52.101 --> 03:53.798
Did I tell you about Molly's
latest bright idea?

03:53.885 --> 03:55.887
She wants us to write
our own wedding vows.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.193
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.934
She's gonna recite
some beautiful soliloquy

03:59.021 --> 04:00.457
and I'm gonna be quoting
dirty limericks

04:00.544 --> 04:02.024
and Dan Fogelberg songs.

04:02.111 --> 04:05.288
Oh, I love Dan Fogelberg.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.160
I saw him live
at Kingston Mines in '73.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.032
Did you pee on him?

04:10.119 --> 04:11.860
When are you gonna let that go?

04:13.383 --> 04:15.037
You don't need
to sweat the vows.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.735
I've heard you wax poetic
for 20 minutes about lasagna.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.260
Oh, you mean the one
from Arnie Salerno's?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.131
You can't just call
that lasagna.

04:22.218 --> 04:23.611
It's a work of art.

04:23.698 --> 04:26.614
It's a perfect union
of gooey mozzarella

04:26.701 --> 04:28.529
and taut, teasing noodles

04:28.616 --> 04:30.661
and a deceptively simple sauce

04:30.748 --> 04:33.534
each ingredient frolicking
in my mouth

04:33.621 --> 04:36.276
like dolphins
dancing in the waves.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.931
It didn't just sate my hunger.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.629
It changed my life.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.980
Damn.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.895
I can almost taste it.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.549
Right?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.377
Hey, you can do this vow thing.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.248
Just substitute
"lasagna" with "Molly"

04:52.335 --> 04:53.902
change the sauce to her eyes
and try not

04:53.989 --> 04:55.904
to describe her
as a taut, teasing noodle.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.515
Speaking of which,
I gotta whiz again.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.518

05:01.605 --> 05:05.261
"And like the emergence
of the wildflowers of spring

the fertile fields of my heart

of bright colors."

05:15.532 --> 05:16.751
What?

05:16.838 --> 05:19.928
Something stinks,
and it ain't this fish.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.669
Is the alliteration
of "fertile fields"

05:21.756 --> 05:23.192
and "dainty dots" too much?

05:23.279 --> 05:24.759
No, I liked that part.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.588
Mostly because it was the end.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.024
Maybe you should try
moving the ending

05:29.111 --> 05:32.506
about ten minutes closer
to the beginning.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.986
Well, clearly, you two would
know more about poetry

05:35.073 --> 05:36.292
than an English lit major.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.511
Why do you keep harping on

05:37.598 --> 05:38.990
being an English lit major?

05:39.077 --> 05:41.732
Yeah, you mentioned it
twice in your vows.

05:42.777 --> 05:43.778
Backstory.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.040
It's friends and family.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.390
They're coming
for free cake and booze

05:47.477 --> 05:50.872
not to sit through
Ken Burns presents Molly Flynn.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.703
Those hens are always clucking
about something, aren't they?

05:55.790 --> 05:58.967
I don't think they'd appreciate
being referred to as "hens."

05:59.054 --> 06:02.057
But, yes, they are always
clucking about something.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.190
[doorbell rings]

06:07.541 --> 06:09.717
I got my shoes off.

You don't have to tell me
you got your shoes off.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.896
I'm not tearing up because
these cartoons are sad.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.553
Harry, what are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

06:19.640 --> 06:21.990
I've come a-calling
for the fair Victoria.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.601
Wait a minute. Victoria's
the girl you wanted to ask out?

06:24.688 --> 06:26.386
Aw, geez,
this'll be hard to watch.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.127
Like a walrus swimming
into a boat motor.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.783
Why don't you and I have
a little talk out on the porch?

06:32.870 --> 06:34.002
Is this a pep talk?

my intentions are honorable.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.578
I mean, my thoughts are filthy

06:44.665 --> 06:47.581
but I rarely act on them.

I think it's great

about yourself

and you wanna pursue
a relationship

06:51.672 --> 06:53.195
but come on. Victoria?

Are you talking
about the age difference?

06:54.892 --> 06:56.633
'Cause I can pull out
the old Jean jacket

06:56.720 --> 07:00.115

to walk before you can run.

your Facebook page

that you're a fan
of the Black Keys

07:39.023 --> 07:41.548

07:41.635 --> 07:43.463
And I happen to be in possession

07:43.550 --> 07:47.031
of two primo tix
for Saturday's awesome gig.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.250
I thought it was sold out.

with your beauty

I'd make it this far

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
so I didn't plan
past you saying "no."

09:49.893 --> 09:51.460
- Whiskey?
- Please.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.028

09:54.115 --> 09:56.204
her boyfriend had been killed
in a dirt bike accident

09:56.291 --> 09:57.945
so she was vulnerable
and most of the guys

09:58.032 --> 10:00.164
in her league were feeling
a little gun-shy.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.383
Understandable.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.691
I mustered up the courage
to ask her out

10:04.778 --> 10:06.954
and to my amazement,
she said yes.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.521
I showed up at the dance with
a new shirt, a corduroy vest

10:09.609 --> 10:11.219
and a pair
of my dad's dress khakis.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.917
Hmm. Hello, sexy.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.225
- Molly, please.
- Sorry.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.836
Anyway, by the end
of the night

10:19.923 --> 10:21.838
Betsy had slow-danced
or dry-humped

10:21.925 --> 10:23.579

varsity letter and an erection.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.455
Oh, honey.

10:30.542 --> 10:34.242
Yeah, apparently, I was the
warm-up act for the entire team.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.113
And while they were enjoying
the fruits of my labor

10:36.200 --> 10:38.463
I was in the parking lot
splitting a meat lover's pizza

10:38.550 --> 10:41.075
with the fat tuba player
from the marching band.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.340
Yeah, I've got a similar story.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.689
Mine ends with me
splitting a bag

10:46.776 --> 10:48.299
of white castle hamburgers

10:48.386 --> 10:50.693
with a very grabby
equipment manager.

I don't remember
writing any of this.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.950
Did I dream this or were you
in the backyard last night

11:30.037 --> 11:32.822
drunk and throwing
a knife at a tree?

11:32.909 --> 11:34.432
No.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.565
I don't think so, Snoop Dogg.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.701
Uh, hey, I-I need to talk to you
about your date with Harry.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.312
Oh, it's not a date.
We're just going to a concert.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.706
I think Harry might see it
a little differently

11:46.793 --> 11:48.142
and I know you don't
want to hurt him.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.274
Why in the world
would I ever hurt him?

11:50.361 --> 11:51.711
You wouldn't, intentionally.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.061
You know how you are
with guys, and..

11:54.148 --> 11:56.367

Listen, Molly,
God gave me a big heart

12:21.436 --> 12:23.699
and an amazing set of honkers.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.051
And I will not apologize
for that.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.661
And I'm not asking you to.

I just think Harry might have
unrealistic expectations.

of concert tickets

12:38.714 --> 12:41.195
is gonna give him
a backstage "ass pass?"

12:43.588 --> 12:46.983
God, no. That-that's not
what I'm saying at all.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.377
Or would ever say.

a sweet, nice guy.
