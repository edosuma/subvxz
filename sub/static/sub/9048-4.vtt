WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:03.134
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:03.136 --> 00:05.203
- "Have we met?"

00:05.205 --> 00:08.139
- "You are cute."

00:08.141 --> 00:10.174
- I'm around to talk later
after school.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.710
- I'll hit you up later,
but it won't be to talk.

00:12.712 --> 00:15.413
- Oh, hey, Jenna.
- Is Matty here?

00:17.382 --> 00:20.017
- I had overslept,
but I didn't remember sleeping.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.419
I had been tossing and turning
all night.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.921
Why had Eva been
at Matty's house?

00:23.923 --> 00:24.889
Were they hooking up?

00:24.891 --> 00:26.724
Was Matty confiding in her
about his life,

00:26.726 --> 00:29.293
and where was my stupid
Palos Hills High hoodie?

00:29.295 --> 00:32.563
I was already late to Tamara's
senior hallway decorating sesh

00:32.565 --> 00:35.266
for spirit week,
but I was dispirited.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.069
There was zero pep in my step.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.471
[Cell phone rings]

00:40.473 --> 00:42.440
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.574
I know it's not an excuse,

00:43.576 --> 00:45.243
but Eva was
at Matty's house last night.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.111
I mean, I try to be a good
friend, and then he goes out

00:47.113 --> 00:49.547
and replaces me with the
next random girl he can find.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.815
And what's her deal anyway?

00:50.817 --> 00:52.917
I mean, she thinks she's so cool
and knows everything.

00:52.919 --> 00:55.052
It's, like, stop trying to be
friends with everyone.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.287
And why are her legs so long?

00:56.289 --> 00:58.522
She looks
like a freaking alien.

00:58.524 --> 00:59.724
- Um, it's Eva.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.627
Tamara's doing a million things,
and she wanted to see

01:02.629 --> 01:04.595
if you could bring her
a large coffee.

01:04.597 --> 01:06.631
- Is that Jenna?
And a cronut.

01:06.633 --> 01:07.832
- And a cronut.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.334
- Sure thing.

01:10.336 --> 01:11.969
[Keys clacking]

01:11.971 --> 01:13.938
[Thud]

01:13.940 --> 01:16.707
- [Gasps]
Cronut me.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.777
- Wow. Looks like Matty's
new friend Eva's here.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.613
- Do I hear a bitch pitch
in your voice?

01:22.615 --> 01:24.515
She volunteered
for senior spirit committee.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.250
- Yeah, well, I think she
also volunteered

01:26.252 --> 01:27.285
to be his new side piece.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.686
- So?
She's an eager beaver.

01:28.688 --> 01:33.024
Or he's eager for her--
- no, don't.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.058
- Enough.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.126
Stop moping over Matty.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.662
The easiest way to get over
getting busy with him

01:37.664 --> 01:39.931
is to get busy doing something
or someone else,

01:39.933 --> 01:43.167
but since you could benefit
from having a lock on your box,

01:43.169 --> 01:44.368
you should concentrate on--

01:44.370 --> 01:46.470
[cell phone vibrates]
One second.

01:46.472 --> 01:48.372
- Did you get another phone?
- No.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.274
Well, yes,
but this one's Autumn's.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.210
- Wait. Who's Autumn?
- Autumn San Diego--

01:53.212 --> 01:55.713
the online persona I created
to catfish Jake.

01:55.715 --> 01:58.816
- Okay, as your friend,
it is my job to tell you

01:58.818 --> 02:02.386
that what you're doing is weird,
stalker-y, and not healthy.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.087
End it.

02:03.089 --> 02:05.122
- Chill
with the freak and critique.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.458
Of course I'll end it,
just not now.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.126
I am too busy
to break up again.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.528
- But if you--
- hold that thought.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.662
I have another one for you.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.297
You should cochair
spirit committee with me.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.267
It's a total resume padder,
and I need all hands on deck.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.202
If the seniors don't win
spirit week,

02:18.204 --> 02:20.004
I'll jump overboard.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.072
- You don't need me.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.074
I'm sure that it'll be
smooth sailing

02:23.076 --> 02:24.208
now that you're in charge.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.177
But I really do need you
to show me

02:26.179 --> 02:29.380
where to put
these, um, rave sticks.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.781
- It's a robot arm.

02:30.783 --> 02:35.319
The theme is the future.
Duh!

02:35.321 --> 02:36.187
[Whistle blows]

02:36.189 --> 02:38.456
The banner is crooked!
- Nice robot penises.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.391
- Can you help us, please,
with this?

02:40.393 --> 02:43.461
- No. Your presidency,
your problem.

02:43.463 --> 02:47.932
- Matty, can you help?
- Sure.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.266
- Oh.

02:49.268 --> 02:50.835
[Grunts]
Okay.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.769
- Got it?

02:51.771 --> 02:55.206
Okay, catch you later, E.

02:56.375 --> 02:57.141
- Hey.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.342
Just about last night,

02:58.344 --> 03:00.644
nothing happened
between me and Matty.

03:00.646 --> 03:01.679
He just wanted to talk.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.848
- It's fine,
we're not together.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.617
- Ugh, the sophomore sluts.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.085
- The sophomore sluts,
or the S.S.,

03:08.087 --> 03:10.921
are the mortal enemies
of senior girls everywhere.

03:10.923 --> 03:13.157
Somehow these girls
had magically morphed

03:13.159 --> 03:15.059
over the summer
from dorky freshmen

03:15.061 --> 03:17.495
to a hoard of cleavage-bearing,
short-shorts-wearing,

03:17.497 --> 03:19.797
giggling kesha clones
who were only too happy

03:19.799 --> 03:21.699
to hang all over
the senior guys.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.367
- What's with
their hair extensions?

03:23.369 --> 03:25.136
They don't match
their whore-drobe.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.971
Is this some kind
of skanky cult thing?

03:26.973 --> 03:28.839
- Orange means
they're willing to kiss,

03:28.841 --> 03:29.774
pink--BJs,

03:29.776 --> 03:32.143
red--they're willing
to go all the way,

03:32.145 --> 03:33.444
and silver--
- back door?

03:33.446 --> 03:35.279
- Back door, front door,
basement, and attic.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.481
- [Gasps] Sluts.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.116
Tamara, do not use that term.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.952
There will be no slut-shaming
at this school.

03:41.954 --> 03:44.021
I prefer "slappers" or "slags."

03:44.023 --> 03:45.956
It's British. Mm.

03:45.958 --> 03:49.126
- Val, your hair
is very colorful.

03:49.128 --> 03:50.594
- Oh, thanks.
You noticed.

03:50.596 --> 03:53.431
It's the hot new trend.
All the cool kids are doing it.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.665
- We aren't.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.566
- Your point?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.101
- Val, I'm not sure
you fully understand

03:57.103 --> 03:59.703
what those extensions
really mean.

03:59.705 --> 04:00.938
- Yeah, I do.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.507
They mean that you old ladies
are behind the times.

04:03.509 --> 04:07.244
So go back to your hard candies
and your mothballs,

04:07.246 --> 04:10.381
Dame Judi Denches,
because I...

04:10.383 --> 04:12.383
Am the future.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.652
- What the hell are you doing?

04:14.654 --> 04:17.121
That's va-Jenna's job,
not the captain's.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.089
- I don't mind.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.958
I like sorting the pom-poms.
They're so colorful and fun.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.196
And sometimes I like to pretend
they're little Fluffy dogs.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.831
[Imitates barking]

04:26.833 --> 04:27.965
[Laughs, imitates bark]

04:27.967 --> 04:30.234
- So I was reading the Bible
last night.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.268
- [Gasps]
Really?

04:31.270 --> 04:32.236
That's so awesome.

04:32.238 --> 04:33.537
Were you at a hotel
or something?

04:33.539 --> 04:34.839
- My dad bought one
when he thought

04:34.841 --> 04:36.941
he was going
to white-collar prison.

04:36.943 --> 04:37.975
Anyway, I read that verse

04:37.977 --> 04:39.410
about how the meek
shall inherit the earth.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.579
- [Gasps]
Matthew 5:5...

04:41.581 --> 04:43.280
Or Matthew high five.

04:43.282 --> 04:46.217
- Right, but now
I'm not so sure

04:46.219 --> 04:47.585
that cheering
is what Jesus would do.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.187
I mean, shouting
and wearing short skirts

04:50.189 --> 04:51.655
isn't exactly meek, is it?

04:51.657 --> 04:55.059
- Well, I never thought of it
like that,

04:55.061 --> 04:58.562
but I always thought Jesus
would be a cheerleader,

04:58.564 --> 05:00.498
and definitely Mary.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.501
- That's a really good point.

05:03.503 --> 05:07.037
Reverse you're welcome.

05:07.039 --> 05:07.972
Thanks.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.308
You know, some people
have been saying that the power

05:11.310 --> 05:13.310
of the captaincy has really been
going to your head,

05:13.312 --> 05:15.112
but I don't think
that's true.

05:15.114 --> 05:17.781
- People are saying that?
- Don't worry.

05:17.783 --> 05:20.084
They said the same about me
when I was captain,

05:20.086 --> 05:22.453
though "good Christian girl"
isn't exactly my brand.

05:22.455 --> 05:25.289
Oh, another fun fact
from the Bible.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.526
Did you know
that "Judas" and "Lissa" have

05:28.528 --> 05:30.227
the same amount of letters?

05:30.229 --> 05:31.428
So weird.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.963
[Chuckles]

05:32.965 --> 05:36.734
- It's time for the first
competition of spirit week--

05:36.736 --> 05:38.936
chubby bunny.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.037
[Applause]

05:40.039 --> 05:42.907
You all know the rules.
- I'm afraid I don't.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.009
Is chubby bunny
some sort of fat rodent?

05:45.011 --> 05:46.844
- No, it's
a physical challenge.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.679
You put a marshmallow
in your mouth,

05:48.681 --> 05:49.780
and you say "chubby bunny."

05:49.782 --> 05:51.415
The first person
to say "chubby bunny" clearly

05:51.417 --> 05:53.784
with the most mallows
in their mouth wins.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.886
- That is rude!
- So piggish.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.122
- You're both rude and piggish,
and it's tradition.

05:58.124 --> 06:00.891
Now, can each class rep
please come to the stage?

06:00.893 --> 06:02.493
[All giggling]

06:02.495 --> 06:04.528
And, of course,
the senior-class rep

06:04.530 --> 06:08.465
and three-time chubby bunny
champ Matty McKibben,

06:08.467 --> 06:09.633
come on up.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.769
[Cheers and applause]
- Please!

06:11.771 --> 06:12.803
Let me do it this year.

06:12.805 --> 06:16.173
I'm not allowed sugar at home.
- Go for it, man.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.075
- But it's really important
that we win this.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.711
- Kyle's gonna kill it.
Look at that intensity.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.980
- Ugh, fine.
Get up here, Kyle.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.216
- Move.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.953
- On your mark, get set, stuff!

06:28.955 --> 06:30.454
- [Clearly]
Chubby bunny.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.589
- [Mumbling]
Chubby bunny.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.123
- [Clearly]
Chubby bunny.

06:33.125 --> 06:33.958
[Applause]

06:33.960 --> 06:37.695
- It's supposed to melt
in your mouth not in your hand.

06:37.697 --> 06:38.796
- I'm a diabetic.

06:38.798 --> 06:42.166
- Ugh, freshman, is your brain
even fully formed yet?

06:42.168 --> 06:44.768
Do you still breast-feed?
- Not since I was eight.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.469
All: Ew.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.172
- Kyle, you're not supposed
to eat them.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.607
- Can't stop.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.774
Sugar high.

06:50.776 --> 06:51.809
So high!

06:51.811 --> 06:54.245
- The marshmallows are blazed.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.646
- [Laughs]

06:55.648 --> 06:57.948
- My turn.

06:59.351 --> 07:01.852
[All gasp]

07:01.854 --> 07:03.654
- Mmm.
[Giggles]

07:03.656 --> 07:07.358
[Mumbling]
Chubby bunny.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.960
Mmm.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.195
[Mumbling]
Chubby bunny.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.463
- Sophomores win!

07:12.465 --> 07:16.467
[Cheers and applause]

07:17.669 --> 07:20.304
- Yes! It is
all about MacKenzie.

07:20.306 --> 07:21.805
That girl is a professional.

07:21.807 --> 07:24.074
- We're talking star quality.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.876
- Matty.

07:25.878 --> 07:26.844
Are you okay?

07:26.846 --> 07:29.146
- I'm fine.
Why?

07:29.148 --> 07:32.416
- You're not upset about the end
of your chubby bunny reign?

07:32.418 --> 07:35.819
- Yeah, yeah, I'm really
broken up about it.

07:35.821 --> 07:37.021
- [Chuckles]
Listen...

07:37.023 --> 07:40.224
I know our relationship
has changed, and it's cool.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.359
I just thought
that I would be the person

07:42.361 --> 07:45.162
that you would want to talk to
about stuff,

07:45.164 --> 07:46.730
not someone you barely know.

07:46.732 --> 07:51.135
- So you want me to run people
by you before I talk to them?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.137
- No, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.306
- [Giggles]
Matty, did you see me win?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.473
- Yeah, yeah, congratulations.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.842
- So Matty had completely
replaced me in his life.

07:58.844 --> 07:59.877
Eva for conversation,

07:59.879 --> 08:02.413
and MacKenzie
was clearly available

08:02.415 --> 08:03.480
for whatever else he needed.

08:03.482 --> 08:06.850
I was rendered obsolete
in less than a day.

08:06.852 --> 08:07.818
- We look like idiots.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.120
- Oh, we're supposed
to be robots.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.822
- I know,
but we look like hobos

08:11.824 --> 08:14.458
who pose like statues
for money.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.026

an original sophomore slut.

tramp stamp was simply known

12:47.833 --> 12:49.766

No offense, Ally.

were so stressful

13:15.494 --> 13:17.928

about their emotions.

out a lot of emotions in me.

but beating the sophomore slut--

13:26.438 --> 13:27.671

14:32.671 --> 14:34.137

14:34.139 --> 14:36.306

cheer captain.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.644

Because...

Because...

the captaincy,

with a beard said that's a sin.

what Santa said.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.858
I need a more concrete excuse,
like an injury.

I'll be cheer captain!

a Val teaching moment.
