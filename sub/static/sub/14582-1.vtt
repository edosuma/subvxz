01:29.857 --> 01:30.824
HEY, OLIVIA.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.360
CAN WE GET THIS PLACE
CURB-PERFECT BY 5:00?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.627
4:59, GUARANTEED.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.363
THANK YOU.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.598
YOU ARE GONNA BE GREAT AT THIS.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.533
GIVE IT SIX MONTHS,
AND YOU'LL BE THE NEW ME.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.868
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND

01:40.901 --> 01:42.603
WHEN I SAID I WANTED
TO FIND MYSELF.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.804
WELL, WE'LL SEE.

01:43.837 --> 01:44.805
DON'T SAY IT--

01:44.838 --> 01:45.873
"ALL THE WORLD'S--

01:45.906 --> 01:47.141
"--A STAGING."

01:51.512 --> 01:54.548
SO, ARE YOU GETTING EXCITED
ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.217
WHY? WHAT'S
THIS WEEKEND?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.285
JUST KIDDING.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.852
YES, I CAN'T WAIT.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.588
THERE'S A SLIGHT GLITCH
WITH THE MUSIC,

02:00.621 --> 02:01.622
BUT I'M ON IT.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.690
WE DON'T NEED MUSIC.

02:02.723 --> 02:03.691
IT'S YOUR WEDDING.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.592
SECOND WEDDING.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.660
EVEN A SECOND WEDDING
SHOULD BE MEMORABLE.

02:06.694 --> 02:09.330
AND TELL ME YOU AT LEAST
TRIED ON THE DRESS.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.598
I WILL.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.366
YOU ARE THE WORST BRIDE EVER.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.335

02:15.836 --> 02:17.238
OH, LET ME JUST...

02:18.439 --> 02:20.208
THOSE GO BYE-BYE.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.242
OKAY...

02:25.379 --> 02:26.680
-BRUCE.

MY ASSOCIATE,

02:29.917 --> 02:31.785
GRACE.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.654
WE ARE HERE TO STAGE
YOUR HOME FOR THE OPEN HOUSE.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.423
I KNOW JOSH SAID
THIS WAS NECESSARY,

02:35.456 --> 02:36.590
BUT IT JUST FEELS...

02:36.624 --> 02:37.891
-INTRUSIVE?
-A LITTLE.

02:37.925 --> 02:38.959
A LOT.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.594
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.196
THE THING IS,
A BUYER WANTS TO KNOW

02:42.230 --> 02:43.431
WHAT A HOME
COULD LOOK LIKE,

02:43.464 --> 02:45.433
NOT WHAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.568
MEMORIES ARE WONDERFUL, BUT...

02:47.601 --> 02:49.503
THEY'RE YOURS.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.472
ALL RIGHT, GO TO IT.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.541
I'LL BE AT MY OFFICE.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.908
OKAY.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.844
DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.412
THANK YOU.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.580
MM-HMM.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.551
OKAY...

03:03.584 --> 03:04.685

03:04.718 --> 03:05.953
LAMP CAN STAY.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.222
CURTAINS GO.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.663
QUOTES FROM
"THE WIZARD OF OZ"?

03:15.696 --> 03:16.864
BRINGS TO MIND TORNADOS,
WITCHES,

03:16.897 --> 03:18.466
AND DEPRESSED FARMLANDS.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.934
ALL OF THESE
KNICKKNACKS CAN GO.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.636
AW, "WORLD'S GREATEST DAD."

03:22.670 --> 03:23.637
THAT'S SWEET.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.638
YEAH, SWEET,

03:24.672 --> 03:26.006
BUT GUILT-INDUCING.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.040
DO WE WANT TO
TAKE THE CHANCE

03:27.074 --> 03:30.344
THAT AN ALL-CASH BUYER
MISSED HIS KID'S SCHOOL PLAY

03:30.378 --> 03:31.645
OR FIRST PITCH?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.454
IT'S WAY TOO CROWDED IN HERE.

03:40.488 --> 03:43.557
LET'S LOSE EVERYTHING,
MAKE IT MORE SIMPLE.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.759
OH!

06:18.479 --> 06:20.781

MEET YOU THERE

06:23.917 --> 06:25.486
FRIDAY NIGHT?

WE'RE NOT UNROMANTIC, ARE WE?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.216
NO, LOOK AT US.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.952

07:07.995 --> 07:09.863
OLIVIA, THE PLACE

07:09.897 --> 07:11.599
I'VE FALLEN BACK

THE LAST TIME
YOU TRIED TO FIX THAT.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.546

I DON'T KNOW, SHOULDN'T
THE BRIDE BE DECIDING THIS?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.733
I LIKE THE LEMON.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.601
I JUST HEARD FROM
THE BRIDE'S DAUGHTER.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.836
DON'T TELL ME

08:02.583 --> 08:03.751

08:51.164 --> 08:52.833
TOODLES.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.869
TOODLES.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.107
SOUNDS LIKE A DATE.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.308
SHE'S VERY FRIENDLY.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.610
SHE LIKES YOU.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.144
YEAH, I'M IRRESISTIBLE.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.813
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
RE-ENTER THE DATING POOL

09:05.846 --> 09:06.880
SOMETIME.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.970
BE READY SOON, GRACE!

09:31.939 --> 09:32.940
HI!

09:32.973 --> 09:34.141
MOM...

09:34.174 --> 09:35.709
ARE YOU DRIVING UP WITH US?

09:35.743 --> 09:36.777
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.745
JOHNNY HAS A GOLF TOURNAMENT.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.046
WE'RE DRIVING UP TOMORROW.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.681
WHO...

09:40.714 --> 09:41.849
WHO'S JOHNNY?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.617
OH, MY PLUS ONE.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.953
YOU ARE GOING TO
LOVE HIM.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.121
HE'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF MY LAST PLUS ONE.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.857
OH.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.825
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.093
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM

09:53.126 --> 09:55.195
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
BE ALONE ANYMORE.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.898
OH, MOM, I'M NOT ALONE.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.667
I HAVE GRACE, AND I HAVE WORK.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.735
THAT IS NOT THE SAME
AS HAVING A HUSBAND.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.804
I SHOULD KNOW, I'VE HAD A FEW.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.138
AND WHAT IS THIS I HEAR

10:05.172 --> 10:08.275
ABOUT YOU ORDERING
YOUR WEDDING DRESS ONLINE?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.077
YOU COULD HAVE BORROWED
ONE FROM ME.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.278
I'M NOT SURE WEARING
A WEDDING DRESS

10:11.311 --> 10:12.312
FROM A FAILED MARRIAGE

10:12.345 --> 10:13.847
IS A GOOD IDEA.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.215
JUST BECAUSE THEY ENDED
DOES NOT MEAN THEY FAILED.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.218
OH, THERE SHE IS.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.286
GRAM!

10:19.319 --> 10:20.754
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU

10:20.788 --> 10:21.689
UNTIL TOMORROW.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.758
JUST DROPPING OFF GIFTS
FOR MY TWO GIRLS.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.759
OLIVIA...

10:25.793 --> 10:26.760
THANK YOU, MOM.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.095
NOW, GRACE,

10:28.128 --> 10:29.229
I KNOW THAT YOU PREFER
THE NATURAL LOOK,

10:29.262 --> 10:32.165
BUT YOUR MOTHER WILL ATTEST
TO THE POWER OF MAKEUP.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.202
YOU SHOULD TRY
THE WRINKLE CREAM, HONEY.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.269
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

10:36.303 --> 10:37.671
SOMEONE LIKE JOSH
COMES ALONG.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.808
A DEMAIN.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.883
DID SHE JUST CRITICIZE US,
OR COMPLIMENT US?

10:49.917 --> 10:52.352
I THINK BOTH.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.355
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

10:55.388 --> 10:57.691
YOU AND JOSH
TOOK FOUR DAYS OFF?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.426
I'M PRETTY SURE... NEVER.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.128
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.831
ACTUALLY, I THINK THIS
IS THE FIRST WEEKEND

11:03.864 --> 11:05.899
WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.002
WELL, WE ARE LEAVING
THE CITY BEHIND NOW,

11:09.036 --> 11:10.971
SO YOU TWO
CAN'T DO ANY BUSINESS.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.373
I LIKE YOUR
THINKING, HONEY.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.908
REMEMBER THAT

11:14.942 --> 11:18.111
WHEN I TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ON THE GUEST LIST.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.179
48.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.814
48?

11:20.848 --> 11:24.351
GRACE, THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO JUST BE A FEW FRIENDS.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.986
I KNOW,
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.955
WHY AM I
NOT SURPRISED?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.289
SOME OF THEM

11:29.322 --> 11:30.858
ARE COMING UP
ON SATURDAY...

11:30.891 --> 11:32.192
OKAY, WAIT, SATURDAY?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.827
BUT MOST OF THEM
ARE DRIVING UP ON SUNDAY

11:33.861 --> 11:35.362
FOR THE CEREMONY.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.396
AND THE DINNER,

11:36.429 --> 11:39.032
AND THE MUSIC,

11:39.066 --> 11:41.168
AND THE LANTERN
LIGHTING OVER THE LAKE.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.369
ARE YOU MAD?

11:42.402 --> 11:43.971
NO. NO.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.405
OF COURSE, I'M NOT MAD.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.340
THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.032
HI!

12:12.065 --> 12:13.033
WELCOME TO WILLOW LAKE.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.001
I'M JULIE TURNER.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.502
GRACE PERSHING.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.537
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE,
LIKE, 15 TIMES.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.006
16.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.808
NICE SHOES.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.343
THIS IS MY MOM,

12:23.376 --> 12:25.312
A.K.A. THE WORST
BRIDE EVER.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.147
OH...
HI. I'M OLIVIA.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.281
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.149
NICE TO MEET
YOU, TOO.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.252
WOW, YOUR PLACE
IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.386
THANK YOU.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.088
I MIGHT SUGGEST
YOU MOVE THIS PLANTER

12:35.122 --> 12:36.523
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PORTICO--

12:36.556 --> 12:38.558
-MOM...
-SORRY.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.393
IT'S PERFECT THE WAY IT IS.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.361
WEDDING JITTERS?

12:41.394 --> 12:42.329
WORKAHOLIC.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.430
HMM.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.132
I PROMISE
THE NEXT FEW DAYS

12:45.165 --> 12:47.000
WILL BE AMAZING.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.068
SHALL I SHOW YOU AROUND,

12:48.101 --> 12:49.469
OR SHOULD WE WAIT
FOR THE GROOM?

12:49.502 --> 12:50.938
OH, NO, NO, IT'S JUST US.

12:50.971 --> 12:51.905
HE'LL BE HERE ON SATURDAY.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.040
HOPEFULLY.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.542
HE'S THE WORST GROOM EVER.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.444
THE PERFECT
COUPLE, THEN.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.013
WHO'S THIS?

13:00.047 --> 13:01.014
THAT'S LUCKY.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.082
LUCKY?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.417
HE DOESN'T USUALLY TAKE
TO STRANGERS LIKE THAT.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.020
GOLDEN RETRIEVERS AND I
GO WAY BACK.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.021
WE'VE HAD THREE.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.089
US TOO.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.258
SORRY, GIRLS,
I'LL GRAB THIS REAL QUICK.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.026
BRUCE, HI.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.962
COME ON,
I'LL SIGN YOU IN.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.334
I LOVE THOSE.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.036
WELL, THAT'S GOOD

13:23.070 --> 13:24.604
BECAUSE I'M
YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.039
YOU TOOK THOSE?

13:26.073 --> 13:27.074
THEY'RE AMAZING.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.275
THANKS.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.982
THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.549
IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN I'D HOPED.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.618
WE CAN HAVE THE CEREMONY
EITHER INSIDE OR OUT.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.453
OUTSIDE.
DEFINITELY.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.189
SHOULD WE WAIT FOR
YOUR MOM TO WEIGH IN?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.256
SHE WON'T CARE.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.357
YOU'RE SURE?

13:44.391 --> 13:45.258
POSITIVE.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.294
SHE'D GET MARRIED
IN THE CAR IF SHE COULD.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.930
THAT COULD WORK.
WE DO HAVE A TRUCK.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.298
ONCE WE GET
YOU SIGNED IN,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.866
I'LL SHOW YOU THE GROUNDS,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.335
AND THE PERFECT OUTDOOR SPOT,

13:55.368 --> 13:57.337
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE
THE TRUCK.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.372
WE'LL KEEP THAT
AS A BACKUP PLAN.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.874
I'LL MAKE SURE IT'S WASHED.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.409
YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEONE.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.244
WHO'S THAT?

14:04.277 --> 14:05.946
ME.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.547
LET'S JUST GO
WITH THE SECTIONAL.

14:07.580 --> 14:10.117
WE CAN CHANGE OUT THE PILLOWS.

14:10.150 --> 14:10.951
A POP OF PINK WOULD BE GREAT--
YES, THANK YOU.

14:10.984 --> 14:11.985
OOH! OH!

14:12.019 --> 14:13.020
YOU OKAY?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.121
I'M SO SORRY.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.388
NO, NO, MY FAULT--

14:17.390 --> 14:18.458
MICK?

14:18.491 --> 14:19.459
LIVVY?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.229
YOU LOOK...

14:22.262 --> 14:24.131
OLDER?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.465
BEAUTIFUL.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.503
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.239
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.374
YOU'RE THE
PERSHING-JOHNSON WEDDING?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.176
YEAH.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.677
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

14:37.710 --> 14:38.912
YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME?

14:38.946 --> 14:40.914
PERSHING WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.249
HOW MANY HUSBANDS
HAVE YOU HAD?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.484
WHY ARE YOU STANDING HERE
WITH ALL THE TOWELS?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.088
I LIVE HERE.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.556
WHAT?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.158
I OWN THE PLACE.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.229
YEAH, IT GETS WORSE.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.065
I'M YOUR WEDDING SINGER.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.008
UH, MOM?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.242
OKAY, I'M DYING.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.377
DAD?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.344
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.379
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.114
-NOTHING.
-EVERYTHING.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.083
IT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO,
BEFORE YOUR FATHER.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.350
BEFORE YOUR MOM.
WE WERE--

15:17.384 --> 15:19.119
---REALLY YOUNG.
---AND STUPID.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.421
--HE GOT A RECORD DEAL,
AND HE WENT OFF TOURING,

15:21.454 --> 15:23.390
--I CAME BACK, AND SHE WAS
ALREADY WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.624
HE WAS MY FIRST LOVE.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.126
SHE BROKE MY HEART.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.095
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.729
I GUESS I JUST NEVER
WANTED TO THINK ABOUT HIM.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.231
--EVER AGAIN.
EVER.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.632
I'LL CANCEL.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.434
WE CAN DO
THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE THING

15:34.467 --> 15:35.735
LIKE YOU WANTED.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.637
YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME
A MEMORABLE WEEKEND,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.239
AND IT WILL BE THAT.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.241
BESIDES, HONEY, WE HAVE
48 PEOPLE COMING THIS SUNDAY.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.443
57.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.511
I LIED.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.181
MAYBE SHE'LL CANCEL.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.516
YOU'D BETTER HOPE NOT.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.318
WE SPENT THEIR DEPOSIT
ON DORM FEES.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.153
ALL OF IT?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.468
HI. THIS IS JOSH JOHNSON.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.104
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AT THE TONE.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.440
JOSH, HEY, IT'S ME.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.775
OKAY, SO, THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.778
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND OF
FUNNY...

16:18.811 --> 16:20.380
OR NOT.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.150
UM, JUST GIVE ME A CALL.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.651
I LOVE YOU.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.523
FOR YOU.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.592
OH.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.693
THANK YOU.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.295
WELL, THEY'RE NOT FROM ME.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.363
THEY'RE FROM A....

16:36.396 --> 16:39.399
"JOSH JOHNSON.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.401
NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE AGENT
IN LONG ISLAND"

16:41.434 --> 16:42.802
GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.237
A LITTLE
OFF YOUR TYPE.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.239
MY TYPE HAS CHANGED.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.611
LOOK, CLEARLY, THIS IS AWKWARD,

16:51.644 --> 16:53.246
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO CANCEL,
I UNDERSTAND.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.381
I DO.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.417
BUT I CAN'T, I DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT MY DAUGHTER.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.819
BESIDES, I BARELY REMEMBER
THE DAY YOU LEFT ME

16:59.852 --> 17:01.621
STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.456
SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE, HUH?

17:03.490 --> 17:04.457
THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.425
WELL, I BEG TO DIFFER.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.194
YOU STILL ALLERGIC TO ROSES?

17:08.228 --> 17:09.496
NO, I'M NOT.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.499
MAYBE YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ME.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.665
MOM!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.635
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
THE HONEYMOON CABIN!

17:15.667 --> 17:17.537
AW, LET ME PUT THESE
IN YOUR ROOM.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.672
THANK YOU.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.340
PUT THEM BY THE WINDOW,
SHE'S ALLERGIC.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.185
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.320
THE RIVER ROCK FIREPLACE?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.188
THE VIEW TO THE LAKE?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.156
HONEY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.759
MY DAD PUT A LOT OF
TIME INTO THIS ONE.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.561
YOUR DAD DID THIS?

17:41.594 --> 17:45.132
YEAH, HE REBUILT
THE ENTIRE PLACE.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.268
IT TOOK HIS MIND OFF THINGS
WHEN MY MOM DIED.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.837
OH.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.405
I DIDN'T KNOW.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.573
I'M SORRY.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.342
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BRING THAT UP.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.410
NO, NO, NO, I'M GLAD YOU DID.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.846
I'VE KNOWN YOUR DAD
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.815
I FEEL AWFUL.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.418
IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS NOW.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.120
HE'S KIND OF SHUT DOWN
SINCE THEN.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.789
WHICH IS WHY
I WAS SO GLAD

18:09.822 --> 18:12.459
HE AGREED TO SING
AT YOUR WEDDING.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.793
HE REALLY DOESN'T
PLAY MUCH ANYMORE.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.628
UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO GET SOMEONE ELSE--

18:15.662 --> 18:17.664
-NO.
-YOU'RE SURE?

18:17.697 --> 18:18.765
ABSOLUTELY.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.767
I MEAN, WHERE ELSE
ARE WE GOING TO FIND A POP STAR

18:20.800 --> 18:21.768
IN VERMONT

18:21.801 --> 18:24.471
THAT'S AVAILABLE ON SUNDAY
FROM 2:00 TO 4:00?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.872
WHATEVER YOU DO,

18:25.905 --> 18:27.540
DON'T LET HIM HEAR YOU SAY
"POP STAR".

18:27.574 --> 18:28.641
HE HATES THAT.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.677
OKAY, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.179
I'LL LET YOU GET SETTLED IN.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.180
GRACE, I'LL SHOW YOU YOURS.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.147
IT'S JUST ALONG THE PATH.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.383
LEAD THE WAY.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.185
THANK YOU.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.443
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.611
I HAVE TO THROW
A WEDDING FOR HER?

19:04.644 --> 19:05.678
AND SING!

19:05.712 --> 19:06.679
WHILE SHE MARRIES

19:06.713 --> 19:08.848
THE NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE
AGENT IN LONG ISLAND?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.783
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.452
UNLESS YOU STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HER.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.254
FEELINGS?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.155
SHE'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.358
HOW DOES SHE LOOK?

19:20.427 --> 19:22.161
THAT GOOD, HUH?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.421
POP STAR...

19:48.455 --> 19:50.923
STAGER...

19:53.626 --> 19:55.495
LUCKY, NO!

19:55.528 --> 19:57.297
SORRY.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.399
THAT'S OKAY.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.303
HE LOOKS
SO MUCH LIKE ROWDY.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.637
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, I RESCUED HIM,

20:04.671 --> 20:06.773
AND I THINK IT TURNS OUT
HE ACTUALLY RESCUED ME.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.579
YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE FOUND ROWDY?

20:12.612 --> 20:13.813
YEAH.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.516
WASN'T HE EATING PIZZA
BEHIND THE DORM?

20:16.549 --> 20:17.750
THE DOG LOVED HIS PIZZA.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.986
HE DID.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.923
UM...

20:23.956 --> 20:26.626
JULIE TOLD ME ABOUT HER MOM.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.827
I'M SO SORRY.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.697
OH, THAT'S NICE OF YOU,
THANK YOU.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.031
YEAH, UM...

20:32.064 --> 20:34.567
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO ADJUST.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.635
I THINK I'M STILL ADJUSTING.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.869
YEAH.

20:36.903 --> 20:37.904
WHAT ABOUT YOU

20:37.937 --> 20:38.938
AND YOUR HUSBAND?

20:38.971 --> 20:39.806
HUSBAND NUMBER ONE?

20:39.839 --> 20:42.709
OH, THAT DIDN'T TAKE
MUCH ADJUSTING.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.344
HE LEFT AFTER GRACE WAS BORN.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.645
I'M SORRY.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.547
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.354
WELL, YOU SURE PICKED
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE

20:54.387 --> 20:55.588
TO SETTLE DOWN.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.956
OH. YEAH.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.659
IT WAS MY WIFE'S HOMETOWN.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.394
FIGURED IT'D BE A GOOD PLACE
TO RAISE A KID.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.662
JULIE'S A GREAT GIRL.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.630
SO IS GRACE.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.831
YEAH.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.499
I GUESS WE DID PRETTY GOOD THEN.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.668
YEAH.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.373
WELL, I'D BETTER
GET BACK TO MY... STUFF.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.607
OH, SURE.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.642
SEE YA.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.643
YEAH.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.710
OH, UM...

21:17.744 --> 21:18.711
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?

21:18.745 --> 21:19.879
STILL HATES YOU.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.357
SO, THE GROOM.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.791
WILL HE WANT
TO GO OVER THE MENU?

21:31.824 --> 21:33.993
NO, HE AND MY MOM
HAVE THE SAME TASTE.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.395
THEY'RE EXACTLY ALIKE.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.796
THAT MAKES IT EASY.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.598
I GUESS IT DOES.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.667
HEY, GIRLS.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.034
-HELLO.
-HI.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.606
IT'S NICE THAT YOU GUYS
ARE SO CLOSE.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.608
ACTUALLY WE'RE
WORKING TOGETHER,

21:48.641 --> 21:49.742
TEMPORARILY.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.810
SHE'S "GROOMING" ME.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.580
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
STAGERS.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.047
YIKES.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.049
SHE WANTS ME TO BE
JUST LIKE HER.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.385
YIKES AGAIN.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.052
NO KIDDING.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.621
DO YOU HAVE ANY
BROTHERS OR SISTERS?

22:01.654 --> 22:02.589
ONLY CHILD.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.823
ME TOO.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.859
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB,
ORGANIZING THIS WEDDING.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.496
I SURE HOPE SO.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.564
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING HERE.

22:11.598 --> 22:12.865
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS
THE PERFECT WEDDING,

22:12.899 --> 22:14.901
ESPECIALLY SINCE
IT MIGHT BE...

22:14.934 --> 22:16.035
MIGHT BE WHAT?

22:18.638 --> 22:19.706
NOTHING.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.842
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M TALKING SO MUCH.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.777
BECAUSE OUR PARENTS
ARE EXES?

22:24.811 --> 22:26.679
AND WE HAVE
THE SAME SHOES.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.149
HE'S SELLING
THE PLACE.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.818
HE DOESN'T THINK
I KNOW,

22:31.851 --> 22:34.887
BUT HE LEFT THE INFO
ON THE OFFICE COMPUTER.

22:34.921 --> 22:38.124
HE'S NOT EXACTLY
A TECHIE.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.865
HE SAID YOU LOOKED
GREAT, BUT WOW.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.767
-DUKE!
-HI!

22:47.800 --> 22:51.170
AW, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.506
WHO IS OUR BOY GONNA GET
TO DO THE COOKING, HUH?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.741
YOU STILL, UH,
COOKING FRIED CHEESE STICKS

22:54.774 --> 22:55.808
WITH PEANUT BUTTER?

22:55.842 --> 22:56.943
YOU KIDDING?

22:56.976 --> 22:58.778
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
FOR YOUR REHEARSAL DINNER.

23:00.046 --> 23:00.980
AND I'M GONNA
BACK HIM UP ON DRUMS

23:01.013 --> 23:02.048
ON YOUR WEDDING SONG, TOO.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.683
♪ BA-DUM-BUM... ♪

23:03.716 --> 23:04.751
OH, YOU HAVEN'T MISSED A BEAT.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.453
OR LOST A POUND.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.054
-YOU LOOK GREAT.
-THANK YOU.

23:09.889 --> 23:10.923
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT CLUB
THAT WE PLAYED,

23:10.957 --> 23:11.791
THE ONE NEAR THE RIVER?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.993
IT WAS MORE OF
AN INDUSTRIAL RUN-OFF.

23:14.026 --> 23:14.927
WELL, YEAH,

23:14.961 --> 23:16.796
AND WE HAD
THE THREE AUDIENCE MEMBERS...

23:16.829 --> 23:18.665
YEAH, IT WAS THE BARTENDER,
THE WAITER AND THE DISHWASHER.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.832
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.734
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
THE SONG YOU WROTE FOR THAT ONE

23:21.768 --> 23:23.470
WAS, UH... IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.471
YEAH.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.638
OH.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.873
ARE YOU STILL WRITING?

23:26.906 --> 23:30.643
UH, YEAH,
I MEAN, WELL, POST-ITS.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.011
AND WEDDING VOWS.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.513
CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT,
BY THE WAY.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.582
AW, THANK YOU.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.917
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
LIVED HERE?

23:37.950 --> 23:40.052
ALL MY LIFE.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.456
IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.724
HE NEEDS A FRESH START,

23:44.757 --> 23:47.527
AND THERE'S TOO MANY
MEMORIES HERE.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.529
IT SOUNDS LIKE
GOOD MEMORIES.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.230
YEAH.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.702
HE GAVE UP A LOT
TO RAISE ME.

23:55.735 --> 23:56.703
HE SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT DAD.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.204
HE REALLY IS.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.238
YOU'RE LUCKY.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.941
NOT EVERYONE HAS
ONE OF THOSE.

24:01.974 --> 24:02.909
HE WON'T SAY IT,

24:02.942 --> 24:05.745
BUT HE'S DREADING THE DAY
I LEAVE FOR COLLEGE.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.146
MY MOM WENT THROUGH
THAT PHASE.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.615
AND SHE SURVIVED?

24:08.648 --> 24:09.916
THEY ALL DO.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.551
AND HE'LL MAKE
YOUR ROOM REALLY NICE

24:11.584 --> 24:12.785
WHEN YOU COME HOME
FOR HOLIDAYS,

24:12.819 --> 24:14.253
SO YOU WON'T
WANT TO LEAVE.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.689
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND SO BAD.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.257
HE'LL PROBABLY BUY
HIMSELF A FEW THINGS,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.527
CLOTHES,
MAYBE A NEW CAR.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.594
OKAY...

24:21.628 --> 24:23.563
AND THEN THERE'S
THE HOBBIES.

24:23.596 --> 24:24.964
YOU KNOW, THE THINGS
THEY THOUGHT

24:24.997 --> 24:27.600
THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
BUT REALLY DIDN'T?

24:27.634 --> 24:28.768
LIKE WHAT?

24:28.801 --> 24:31.538
IN MY MOM'S CASE,
IT WAS WEAVING.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.840
FOLLOWED BY
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.

24:33.873 --> 24:34.907
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING?

24:34.941 --> 24:37.910
IT'S AN OLYMPIC EVENT.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.679
OH, AND
THE MANDARIN LESSONS.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.213
YOUR MOM
CAN SPEAK MANDARIN?

24:41.247 --> 24:43.015
"NI HAO.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.051
NI CHIFAN LE MA."

24:45.084 --> 24:46.819
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

24:46.853 --> 24:48.688
"HELLO, HAVE YOU EATEN?"

24:48.721 --> 24:49.756
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH
WHAT SHE ASKS ME

24:49.789 --> 24:52.124
IN ENGLISH
FIVE TIMES A DAY.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.094
THANK YOU.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.663
'KAY. TALK
TO YOU SOON.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.267
JOSH, HI!

25:01.300 --> 25:02.234
SO, GUESS WHAT I JUST HEARD?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.369
DID GRACE CALL YOU?

25:03.402 --> 25:06.072
HONEY, I... I WANTED
TO TELL YOU MYSELF.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.907
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL--

25:07.940 --> 25:09.208
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:09.241 --> 25:11.143
IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.112
PROPERTIES LIKE THAT
NEVER COME ON THE MARKET.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.615
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:15.648 --> 25:16.916
THE LISTING WENT UP YESTERDAY.

25:16.949 --> 25:17.917
"FOR SALE BY OWNER.

25:17.950 --> 25:18.985
NO BROKER."

25:19.018 --> 25:20.720
APPARENTLY, THE OWNER
IS SOME SINGER

25:20.753 --> 25:22.321
WHO WAS FAMOUS IN THE '70s?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.323
IT WAS THE '80s.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.925
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD
PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME

25:25.958 --> 25:26.926
BEFORE I GET UP THERE?

25:26.959 --> 25:29.261
ACTUALLY, NO, I CAN'T.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.863
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE WEIRD,

25:30.897 --> 25:32.699
BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT,

25:32.732 --> 25:34.300
HE'S MY COLLEGE BOYFRIEND.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.238
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.807
I KNOW, IT'S TOTALLY AWKWARD.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.841
AWKWARD?

25:41.874 --> 25:43.209
IT'S GREAT.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.678
UNLESS HE HATES YOU
FOR BREAKING UP WITH HIM.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.013
NO.

25:47.046 --> 25:47.980
IF I GET THIS LISTING,

25:48.014 --> 25:49.982
IT COULD OPEN UP
THE HIGH-END VERMONT MARKET.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.984
THIS COULD BE BIG FOR US.

25:52.018 --> 25:54.721
I... I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.988
WELL, THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

25:57.189 --> 26:00.126
HONEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
COMING UP BEFORE SATURDAY?

26:00.159 --> 26:02.094
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

26:02.128 --> 26:03.963
I DON'T KNOW,

26:03.996 --> 26:05.164
I JUST MISS YOU.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.365
AW...

26:06.398 --> 26:07.667
I MISS YOU, TOO--

26:07.700 --> 26:08.601
OH, HANG ON,

26:08.635 --> 26:09.602
I GOT ANOTHER CALL.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.837
I GOTTA TAKE THIS ONE.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.747
JULIE SAID THIS IS
BEST FOOD IN TOWN.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.149
GREAT.
I AM STARVING.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.763
HI THERE, HANDSOME.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.599
YOU CLEANED UP
REAL GOOD.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.406
DID YOU TRY ON THE DRESS YET?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.407
MM.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.909
I WILL.

26:49.942 --> 26:50.977
I PROMISE.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.078
WEDDING VOWS?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.079
ALMOST.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.113
MOM...

26:54.146 --> 26:55.114
I STARTED.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.315
OKAY.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.283
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.317
OKAY.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.254
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
READ FROM YOUR PHONE

27:02.288 --> 27:03.622
AT THE CEREMONY.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.694
"JOSH...

27:07.727 --> 27:10.096
"WHEN I STAGED YOUR OPEN HOUSE
THREE YEARS AGO,

27:10.129 --> 27:12.331
"I HAD NO IDEA
WE'D END UP HERE.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.701
"REAL ESTATE
IS A SMART INVESTMENT,

27:14.734 --> 27:18.070
AND SO IS OUR RELATIONSHIP."

27:19.238 --> 27:20.973
WHAT? IS THAT BAD?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.308
AWFUL.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.844
ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THIS?

27:24.877 --> 27:25.978
"JOSH,

27:26.012 --> 27:30.016
YOU MOVE HOUSES,
AND YOU MOVE ME."

27:30.049 --> 27:30.983
WHAT WAS THAT?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.353
HER WEDDING VOWS.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.088
I'M STILL WORKING ON THEM.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.156
DO YOU HAVE A TABLE

27:37.189 --> 27:38.324
IN ANOTHER PART OF
THE RESTAURANT?

27:38.357 --> 27:40.827
SORRY, MICK.
IT'S AN HOUR WAIT.

27:41.994 --> 27:42.962
HOW ABOUT ONE
NEAR THE KITCHEN?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.296
OR MAYBE IN THE KITCHEN?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.766
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

27:46.799 --> 27:48.467
UH, NO.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.136
SO...

27:50.169 --> 27:51.303
YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.105
YES, WELL, WE USED TO.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.974
CAMILLE,
THIS IS LIVVY PHILLIPS.

27:55.007 --> 27:55.942
OR, UH, I'M SORRY,

27:55.975 --> 27:58.277
PERSHING...

27:58.310 --> 27:59.211
SLASH-HYPHEN-
JOHNSON-TO BE?

27:59.245 --> 28:00.880
HI.

28:00.913 --> 28:01.981
HI.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.082
-I'M OLIVIA.
-NICE TO MEET YOU.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.083
YEAH, NICE TO
MEET YOU, TOO.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.117
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, GRACE.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.119
-HI.
-HI.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.254
OLIVIA'S GETTING MARRIED
ON SUNDAY.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.189
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.824
THANK YOU.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.092
SHE'S MARRYING THE NUMBER TWO
REAL ESTATE AGENT

28:13.125 --> 28:14.460
IN LONG ISLAND.

28:14.493 --> 28:15.895
OH.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.865
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.

28:18.898 --> 28:19.932
THANK YOU.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.972
SO, WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.974
OH, UM, I THINK
YOU WERE TELLING ME

28:28.007 --> 28:30.910
HOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST
ACTUAL DATE IN AGES.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.047
I THOUGHT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE MET.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.083
AT THE P.T.A. MEETING?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.350
RIGHT.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.387
MOM...

28:41.420 --> 28:43.422
OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.157
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?

28:45.191 --> 28:46.392
WEDDING VOWS.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.960
RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.400
I KNOW IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

28:54.433 --> 28:55.902
BUT HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THE SONG WE WROTE

28:55.935 --> 28:56.936
IN CENTRAL PARK?

28:56.969 --> 29:00.272
I REALLY DON'T RECALL.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.041
-YOU WROTE A SONG?
-SEVERAL.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.210
JUST SOME WORDS,
THAT'S IT.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.078
I THINK WE USED TO
CALL THEM LYRICS.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.380
HOW AM I JUST HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.949
BECAUSE IT WAS
A MILLION YEARS AGO,

29:09.982 --> 29:11.517
AND I BARELY REMEMBER.

29:12.819 --> 29:14.520
WHAT WAS THE SONG?

29:14.553 --> 29:16.088
WHAT WAS IT...

29:16.122 --> 29:17.824
"WHERE DREAMS COME HOME."

29:17.857 --> 29:19.091
REALLY?

29:19.125 --> 29:21.260
NOW, WHERE HAVE I
HEARD THAT BEFORE?

29:21.293 --> 29:23.129
OH, MY.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.097
DO WE HAVE A COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT HERE?

29:28.134 --> 29:31.037
OKAY...

29:32.038 --> 29:33.239
FINE.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.510
I'LL CHANGE IT.

29:38.544 --> 29:39.545
OH, NO.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.947
NO, DON'T.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.949
IT'S CATCHY.

29:52.124 --> 29:52.959
I'M STARVING...

30:14.080 --> 30:15.247
OH...

30:26.658 --> 30:27.626
OH!

30:27.659 --> 30:28.928
OH...

30:28.961 --> 30:29.929
IT'S BAD LUCK
TO SEE THE DRESS

30:29.962 --> 30:30.897
BEFORE THE WEDDING,
RIGHT?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.999
YOU'RE NOT THE GROOM.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.000
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR GRACE,

30:34.033 --> 30:35.067
SHE'S WITH JULIE.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.903
THEY WENT
TO GET FLOWERS.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.037
OH.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.305
YOU FINISH
THOSE VOWS YET?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.007
BECAUSE I HAVE A WHOLE DRAWER
OF UNUSED LYRICS.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.875
OLD UNUSED LYRICS.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.143
OH, IT'S SO HARD TO TURN DOWN,

30:44.176 --> 30:45.111
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY NO.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.112
YOUR LOSS.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.082
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR DATE?

30:50.116 --> 30:51.217
YOU SHOULD KNOW,

30:51.250 --> 30:52.284
YOU WERE PRACTICALLY
ON IT WITH ME.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.354
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'D SAY YOU'RE A BIT RUSTY.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.322
I'M NOT RUSTY!

31:02.028 --> 31:03.896
I GUESS SEEING THE DRESS
BEFORE THE WEDDING

31:03.930 --> 31:05.064
IS BAD LUCK.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.033
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.635
IT'S MY FAULT,

31:09.668 --> 31:10.970
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LEFT THE ROOM.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.304
TAKE IT OFF,
I'LL GET IT CLEANED.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.373
I WOULD
IF I COULD GET OUT OF IT.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.276
I'M PRETTY SURE
CLEANING IS NOT AN OPTION.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.212
IT'S JUST RIGHT HERE.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.683
DO YOU GET ALONG
WITH JOSH?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.318
YEAH.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.886
JOSH IS COOL.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.222
REALLY.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.091
YOU TRYING TO
CONVINCE ME OR YOU?

31:32.124 --> 31:33.926
NO, HE'S A GREAT GUY,

31:33.960 --> 31:36.262
AND MY MOM SEEMS HAPPY.

31:36.295 --> 31:37.596
MOSTLY.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.465
I DON'T KNOW.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.568
I'M JUST NOT SURE I'VE EVER
SEEN THEM ACTUALLY KISS.

31:42.601 --> 31:45.004
I MEAN, ON THE LIPS.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.638
THAT PASSION,

31:46.672 --> 31:49.375
LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.709
BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST
WHAT HAPPENS

31:50.742 --> 31:53.712
WHEN PEOPLE GET OLDER.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.381
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

31:55.414 --> 31:56.682
HAS HE BEEN SEEING ANYONE ELSE?

31:56.715 --> 31:58.317
NO.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.419
I TRY, BUT...

32:00.452 --> 32:03.589
HE DOESN'T PLAY WELL
WITH OTHERS.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.425
MY DAD'S A GREAT GUY,
HE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE--

32:06.458 --> 32:07.659
A LITTLE EXCITEMENT?

32:07.693 --> 32:09.261
EXACTLY.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.997
MY MOM'S THE OPPOSITE.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.598
SHE COULD USE A LITTLE...

32:12.631 --> 32:14.233
SMALL-TOWN-I-NESS?

32:15.734 --> 32:19.238
THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE
THAN JUST WORK, RIGHT?

32:19.271 --> 32:20.472
THERE BETTER BE.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.479
OH!

32:27.513 --> 32:28.747
OH, I'M SORRY.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.116
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GET THAT FIXED.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.150
LOOK-- I'M SORRY.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.384
IT'S FINE.

32:32.418 --> 32:33.419
IF I STAY HERE
LONG ENOUGH,

32:33.452 --> 32:35.287
I MIGHT NEED
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.223
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY BE A BAD THING.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.425
I'M JUST SAYING,

32:39.458 --> 32:41.693
I GUESS I'M USED TO SEEING YOU
IN JEANS AND STUFF.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.330
YOU'RE NOT USED
TO SEEING ME AT ALL.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.100
THAT'S TRUE.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.535
HI, JANEY!

32:49.568 --> 32:50.536
MICK, HOW ARE YOU?

32:50.569 --> 32:51.603
GOOD, GOOD.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.704
WE NEED A DRESS.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.540
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

32:54.573 --> 32:56.575
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
NEVER GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

32:56.608 --> 32:57.609
OH....

32:57.643 --> 32:58.644
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

32:58.677 --> 32:59.745
HE'S STILL
ON THE MARKET.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.513
GREAT.

33:01.547 --> 33:02.714
RIGHT THIS WAY.

33:25.437 --> 33:28.274
LOOKS A LITTLE MERMAID-Y.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.247
NO.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.382
NO.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.549
NO.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.270
THAT'S THE ONE.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.573
REALLY?

34:02.741 --> 34:04.643
DEFINITELY.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.313
OKAY.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.288
WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.822
THERE'S NO "WE".

34:17.856 --> 34:19.158
THANK YOU,

34:19.190 --> 34:20.726
BUT YOU ARE NOT
BUYING MY WEDDING DRESS.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.726
I RUINED THE FIRST ONE.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.761
RING THIS UP.

34:22.793 --> 34:23.728
NO, ACTUALLY, HERE.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.130
PLEASE TAKE MINE.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.331
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

34:26.364 --> 34:27.766
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
THINKING ABOUT YOU

34:27.799 --> 34:28.900
EVERY TIME I WEAR THIS DRESS.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.170
WELL, HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
PLANNING ON WEARING IT?

34:31.203 --> 34:32.704
ONCE.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.375
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME BUY YOU
A CUP OF COFFEE.

34:51.657 --> 34:52.791
SO, YOU'RE A CHEF

34:52.824 --> 34:54.326
AND A DRUMMER?

34:54.360 --> 34:55.761
WELL, I USED TO BE.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.629
YOU QUIT
THE MUSIC BIZ LIKE MICK?

34:57.663 --> 34:59.765
NO, NO, I USED TO BE A CHEF.

34:59.798 --> 35:00.899
I'M STILL A DRUMMER.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.135
RECENT CUTBACKS
AROUND HERE

35:03.169 --> 35:05.171
DON'T REALLY ALLOW ME
TO DO MY BEST WORK, THOUGH.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.738
I DIDN'T SEE THAT
IN THE BROCHURE.

35:06.772 --> 35:07.873
OH, DON'T WORRY,

35:07.906 --> 35:09.241
MICK'S ORDERED
ALL THE TOP-SHELF STUFF

35:09.275 --> 35:11.343
FOR THE WEDDING.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.379
YOU PLAY WITH HIM
BACK IN THE DAY?

35:13.412 --> 35:14.513
YEAH.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.915
YEAH, I WAS THE HEARTBEAT
OF THAT BAND.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.650
WHY DID HE LEAVE?

35:18.684 --> 35:21.820
I THINK HE THOUGHT
HE WAS CHASING A DREAM,

35:21.853 --> 35:25.157
AND HE JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
HE'D LEFT THE REAL THING BEHIND.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.259
WHY DIDN'T MY MOM GO WITH HIM?

35:27.293 --> 35:28.327
THEY WERE A TEAM.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.696
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK
YOUR MOM THAT.

35:30.729 --> 35:33.232
THEY WERE REALLY
THAT GOOD TOGETHER?

35:33.265 --> 35:36.435
THEY WERE A PERFECT HARMONY,
THEY WERE LIKE ONE VOICE.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.569
IT WAS PURE MAGIC.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.839
I WISH I COULD'VE HEARD THEM.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.408
WHAT DID THEY WRITE ABOUT?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.212
I'VE GOT SOMETHING I THINK
YOU MIGHT WANNA HAVE A LOOK AT.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.655
THIS IS EVERY LYRIC

35:56.688 --> 35:58.924
THAT YOUR MOM
AND MICK WROTE.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.729
"I FOUND WARMTH
IN YOUR EMBRACE,

36:03.762 --> 36:05.197
"COMFORT
IN YOUR HEART,

36:05.231 --> 36:07.233
AND HOME
IN YOUR EYES."

36:07.266 --> 36:09.301
WOW.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.570
YEAH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:11.603 --> 36:13.439
THAT'S MICK'S HANDWRITING.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.774
THIS ONE.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.411
YEAH, THAT'S YOUR MOM.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.280
"LOVING YOU
IS LIKE BREATHING

36:21.313 --> 36:22.281
"I CAN'T STOP

36:22.314 --> 36:23.649
"BUT WHEN I DO

36:23.682 --> 36:24.916
"I WANT TO HAVE
MY LAST BREATH SPENT

36:24.950 --> 36:27.986
SHARING A KISS WITH YOU"

36:28.019 --> 36:29.588
IT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING,

36:29.621 --> 36:30.722
'CAUSE IT'S MY MOM,

36:30.756 --> 36:33.225
BUT WOW.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.326
THEY WERE INTENSE.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.927
INTENSE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.397
I JUST CAN'T WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND THIS.

36:38.430 --> 36:41.267
MAYBE PEOPLE GET OLDER, AND...

36:41.300 --> 36:43.502
AND CHANGE.

36:44.870 --> 36:45.937
OR SOMETIMES,

36:45.971 --> 36:48.807
THEY JUST NEED TO BE REMINDED
OF THEIR BEST WORK.

36:49.975 --> 36:52.478
YOU MIND IF I TAKE THESE?

36:52.511 --> 36:53.745
THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.351
THANKS.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.429
YOU KNOW, WE USUALLY
DON'T GET DAUGHTERS

37:10.462 --> 37:12.431
PLANNING THEIR
MOTHERS' WEDDINGS.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.665
OH, YEAH,

37:13.699 --> 37:15.734
GRACE JUST REALLY
WANTS IT TO BE SPECIAL.

37:15.767 --> 37:16.768
DON'T YOU?

37:16.802 --> 37:17.936
YEAH, I...

37:17.969 --> 37:19.305
HONESTLY, I WOULD HAVE
BEEN FINE

37:19.338 --> 37:21.006
WITH A CEREMONY
IN THE COURTHOUSE,

37:21.039 --> 37:24.276
BUT GRACE IS 20
AND STARRY-EYED.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.377
WELL, YOU WERE 20
AND STARRY-EYED.

37:26.445 --> 37:29.381
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.784
OUR KIDS ARE THE SAME AGE
WE WERE WHEN WE MET.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.886
TO BE HONEST,
I'M FREAKING OUT

37:34.920 --> 37:37.289
THAT JULIE'S GOING
AWAY TO COLLEGE.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.358
YEAH, WHEN GRACE
MOVED OUT,

37:39.391 --> 37:41.960
I REDID HER ROOM
FOUR TIMES IN ONE WEEK.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.962
AND I SLEPT
IN HER CHILDHOOD BED,

37:43.995 --> 37:46.698
UNDER A POSTER
OF THE BACKSTREET BOYS.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.467
OKAY, I'M NOT
DOING THAT.

37:51.370 --> 37:55.441
IT'S FUNNY
HOW TIME FLIES.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.042
I STARTED DRINKING
HERBAL TEA

37:57.075 --> 37:58.544
AND POMEGRANATE JUICE.

37:58.577 --> 37:59.978
HMM, ANTIOXIDANTS.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.680
OMEGA 3'S, GLUTEN?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.982
OH, "GLUTEN,"
I HATE THAT WORD.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.484
HOW ABOUT THIS,
"V.I.B.B.A."

38:05.517 --> 38:06.585
"VERMONT INN

38:06.618 --> 38:07.919

ASSOCIATION."

38:07.953 --> 38:08.987
I'M THE TREASURER.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.722
OH. I.P.S.A.

38:15.494 --> 38:16.595
MAPLE SYRUP
GROWERS UNITED.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.063
AND YOU ALREADY
KNOW ABOUT THE P.T.A.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.399
GIRLS WILDERNESS
GROUP LEADER,

38:20.432 --> 38:22.501
NEW YORK BOARD
CO-OP DIRECTOR,

38:25.003 --> 38:27.873
HEY, I CANNED
MY OWN JAM LAST YEAR.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.677
OH, EXCUSE ME.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.812
JOSH!

38:33.845 --> 38:34.780
HEY, SWEETIE.

38:34.813 --> 38:35.847

38:35.881 --> 38:36.848
HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE?

38:36.882 --> 38:38.016
OH, IT'S GOOD.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.951
NOT THAT GOOD.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.420
REGULAR GOOD.

38:41.453 --> 38:42.721
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO TALK TO HIM YET?

38:42.754 --> 38:44.055
WE TALKED.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.724
UM...

38:45.757 --> 38:47.893
LISTEN, HONEY, I'M NOT
FEELING THAT COMFORTABLE

38:47.926 --> 38:49.127
BRINGING IT UP
IN THIS SITUATION.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.629
IS THAT HIM?

38:52.431 --> 38:54.700
UH...YEAH.

38:54.733 --> 38:55.734
PUT HIM ON.

38:55.767 --> 38:56.702
I'LL ASK HIM.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.837
OKAY.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.941
JOSH...

39:07.078 --> 39:08.046
UH, HEY, JOSH.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.047
CONGRATULATIONS.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.115
WELL, THANKS.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.082
I HEARD YOUR PLACE
IS FANTASTIC.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.083
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.318
WELL, IT'S HERE WAITING.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.121
SO OLIVIA TELLS ME
THAT YOU TWO HAVE A HISTORY.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.956
ANCIENT HISTORY.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.926
I BELIEVE IN BEING UPFRONT ABOUT
THINGS, DON'T YOU?

39:20.959 --> 39:23.662
UH... SURE.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.163
SO I'M JUST GOING TO COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.865
OKAY.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.468
I CAN GET YOU WAY ABOVE
ASKING PRICE.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.036
WHAT?

39:31.069 --> 39:32.203
I KNOW THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.506
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME
THE LISTING, I'LL GUARANTEE IT.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.674
THE LISTING...

39:35.707 --> 39:36.642
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.709

39:41.079 --> 39:42.848
WELL... SURE, WHY NOT?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.551
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.

39:45.584 --> 39:46.718
I GOTTA JUMP ON THIS CALL.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.620
TELL OLIVIA I LOVE HER.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.464
WHAT DID HE SAY?

39:58.497 --> 39:59.865
UH...

40:02.634 --> 40:04.035
I LOVE YOU.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.873

40:16.715 --> 40:18.850
BRACE YOURSELF.

40:18.884 --> 40:19.985
I'M BRACED.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.853
WHAT'S SHE GOT
TO CRITICIZE?

40:21.887 --> 40:22.921
SHE'LL FIND SOMETHING.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.992
HI, MOM.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.760
HI, GALS.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.129
AND YOU MUST
BE JOHNNY.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.599
JOHNNY, THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER, OLIVIA,

40:33.632 --> 40:35.100
THE BRIDE-TO-BE.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.101
AND THIS IS GRACE,

40:36.134 --> 40:37.469
MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

40:37.503 --> 40:38.970
WHO WILL ALSO
BE A BRIDE ONE DAY.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.673
NOT ANYTIME SOON, THOUGH.

40:41.707 --> 40:42.908
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.643
MOM, ONE WEDDING
AT A TIME.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.177
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU GIRLS.

40:46.211 --> 40:48.046
WHATEVER SHE SAID,
IT ISN'T TRUE.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.215
HOW WAS
YOUR DRIVE UP?

40:50.248 --> 40:52.951
OH, YOU KNOW,
UNEVENTFUL.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.486
FARMS, TREES.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.187
TREES, FARMS...

40:56.221 --> 40:57.689
AND NORA,
WHO SPOKE NON-STOP.

40:57.723 --> 40:58.724
HEY!

40:59.791 --> 41:00.826
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.961
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LOOK AT THIS LAKE.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.763
AND MAYBE EVEN
JUMP IN.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.797
YOU DO THAT.

41:05.831 --> 41:06.865
MM...

41:10.068 --> 41:11.269
MOM...

41:11.302 --> 41:12.571
I LIKE HIM.

41:12.604 --> 41:13.905
ME TOO.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.974
YEAH, I THINK
HE MIGHT BE A KEEPER.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.075
LET'S SEE THIS PLACE.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.616
OH.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.284
NICE...

41:26.317 --> 41:28.086
VERY NICE.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.555
ISN'T IT?

41:29.588 --> 41:31.256
WOW.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.891
I ASSUME YOU'VE PICKED OUT
ALL YOUR PLACE SETTINGS,

41:32.924 --> 41:34.526
AND FLOWERS, AND CAKE?

41:34.560 --> 41:35.861
PLACE SETTINGS, SILVER.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.262
FLOWERS, LILIES.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.229
CAKE, LEMON.

41:39.297 --> 41:40.298
LEMON.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.232
WHO CHOSE THAT?

41:42.300 --> 41:43.168
I DID.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.103
HONEY, NO ONE HAS LEMON
AT A WEDDING.

41:45.136 --> 41:46.104
MOM...

41:46.137 --> 41:47.138
I LIKE IT.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.874
LEMONS ARE SOUR.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.308
IS THAT HOW YOU WANT
TO START YOUR MARRIAGE?

41:50.341 --> 41:51.610
IT'S A CAKE, MOM.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.611
IT'S NOT LIFE.

41:53.779 --> 41:54.913
WELCOME.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.815
MOM, YOU REMEMBER

41:56.848 --> 41:58.249
MICK TURNER.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.888
YES, OF COURSE, I DO.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.757
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T
INVITE HIM TO YOUR WEDDING?

42:05.791 --> 42:07.626
HE OWNS THE INN.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.128
YOU LOOK GREAT, MRS. PHILLIPS.

42:10.161 --> 42:11.730
IT'S MS. WINTERS, ACTUALLY.

42:11.763 --> 42:13.699
OH, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU REMARRIED.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.133
TWICE AND COUNTING.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.134
ONE KEEPS
DOING SOMETHING

42:16.167 --> 42:17.936
UNTIL THEY
GET IT RIGHT.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.270
I SEE.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.139
AND OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'VE GIVEN UP THE MUSIC.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.876
MICK IS OUR WEDDING SINGER.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.277
OH...

42:26.311 --> 42:28.213
THAT MUST BE SUCH
A COMEDOWN FOR YOU.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.548
NOT REALLY.

42:31.650 --> 42:32.984
I'M GOING TO
MAKE SURE

42:33.018 --> 42:34.085
YOUR LUGGAGE
GETS TO YOUR ROOM.

42:34.119 --> 42:35.787
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.827
MOM...

42:41.860 --> 42:43.862
YOU COULD BE A LITTLE NICER.

42:43.895 --> 42:45.797
I NEVER LIKED THAT BOY.

42:45.831 --> 42:47.298
HE'S HARDLY A BOY.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.634
HE'S JUST LIKE
YOUR FATHER WAS,

42:48.667 --> 42:51.870
RUNNING AFTER...
SOME DREAM.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.672
MOM, IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.707
HE BROKE YOUR HEART.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.242
A MOTHER NEVER GETS OVER THAT.

42:57.275 --> 42:59.110
I GOT OVER IT.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.211
WELL, WE'LL SEE
HOW YOU FEEL

43:00.245 --> 43:02.981
WHEN SOME BOY WITH A GUITAR
BREAKS GRACE'S HEART.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.019
NORA...

43:09.354 --> 43:10.789
COME ON,
LET'S GO FOR A WALK.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.290
OH. OKAY.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.060
A LONG WALK.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.962
THANK YOU.

43:18.129 --> 43:19.064
DID YOU SWIM?

43:19.097 --> 43:20.966
NO, NO.

43:24.870 --> 43:26.772
WHAT'S THAT?

43:26.805 --> 43:29.240
OH, IT'S JUST SOME JUNK MAIL.

43:29.274 --> 43:31.176
DAD...

43:31.209 --> 43:32.978
I KNOW YOU'RE
SELLING THE PLACE.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.650
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

43:38.684 --> 43:39.785
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

43:39.818 --> 43:40.819
I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

43:40.852 --> 43:42.287
IT'S OKAY.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.254
I'M FINE WITH IT.

43:43.288 --> 43:44.956
YOU ARE?

43:44.990 --> 43:46.725
THE PLACE IS TOO BIG,
AND IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.432
I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT...

43:54.465 --> 43:56.167
ALL OUR MEMORIES HERE.

43:56.201 --> 43:58.003
WE'LL MAKE NEW ONES.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.271
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

44:00.305 --> 44:01.940
I'M SURE.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.245
OH, YOUR STUDENTS ARE HERE.

44:07.278 --> 44:08.980
THEY'RE SETTING UP
IN THE GARAGE.

44:09.014 --> 44:11.216
I THINK WE'LL GO
A CAPPELLA TODAY.

44:11.249 --> 44:12.851
THAT'S NOT
LIKE YOU.

44:12.884 --> 44:14.352
YOU DON'T KNOW OLIVIA'S MOTHER.

44:14.385 --> 44:16.354
SHE DOESN'T LIKE MUSIC?

44:16.387 --> 44:18.890
SHE DOESN'T
LIKE MY MUSIC.

44:26.231 --> 44:27.465
LET'S START WITH
"LONELY NIGHT," OKAY?

44:27.498 --> 44:30.068
WE'LL JUST DO

44:30.101 --> 44:31.336

44:31.369 --> 44:33.271

HE HAS PICTURES
OF YOUR MOM.

46:12.137 --> 46:14.139
I FOUND THEM
A LONG TIME AGO,

46:14.172 --> 46:17.175
BUT I NEVER KNEW WHO
THEY WERE UNTIL NOW.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.409
WHY DO YOU THINK

46:18.443 --> 46:20.178
THEY NEVER TALKED
ABOUT EACH OTHER?

46:20.211 --> 46:23.081
MAYBE THE MEMORIES
WERE TOO PAINFUL.

46:23.114 --> 46:24.282
OR TOO GOOD.

46:26.852 --> 46:30.555
AND NOW HE GETS
TO LOSE HER AGAIN.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.209
HI.

46:53.378 --> 46:55.513
THAT WAS... AMAZING.

46:55.546 --> 46:57.082
YOU CAME EARLY.

46:57.115 --> 46:58.516
I MISSED YOU.

46:58.549 --> 47:01.386
THIS IS
STILL YOU, RIGHT?

47:01.419 --> 47:02.520
YEAH, THAT WAS THE OLD ME.

47:02.553 --> 47:03.621
YOU KNOW,
A ONE-TIME PERFORMANCE.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.123
I HAD NO IDEA.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.191
ME EITHER.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.393
YOU MADE IT.

47:09.961 --> 47:11.196
AND A DAY EARLY.

47:11.229 --> 47:12.630
SURPRISES ALL THE WAY
AROUND HERE.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.400
OH, UM, JOSH,
THIS IS JULIE...

47:15.433 --> 47:16.501
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

47:16.534 --> 47:17.936
LIKEWISE.

47:17.969 --> 47:19.237
AND, UM, MICK.

47:19.270 --> 47:21.072
-WELCOME.
-THANK YOU.

47:21.106 --> 47:24.142
SO YOU'RE "THE ONE
THAT GOT AWAY".

47:25.410 --> 47:26.577
YEAH.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.179
YOUR PLACE IS
INCREDIBLE, MAN.

47:28.213 --> 47:29.080
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE REST OF IT.

47:29.114 --> 47:30.148
OH, THANK YOU.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.116
IT WON'T LAST
THE WEEKEND.

47:31.149 --> 47:32.183
I MAY NOT EITHER.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.585
HARD COPIES.

47:34.619 --> 47:36.321
SIGNATURE PAGES
ARE MARKED.

47:36.354 --> 47:37.488
GREAT.

47:37.522 --> 47:38.990
RIGHT.

47:39.024 --> 47:42.060
WELL, I'LL... GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME PRIVACY.

47:42.093 --> 47:43.094
HEY, GUYS, THAT'S A WRAP
FOR TODAY, OKAY?

47:43.128 --> 47:44.029
WE'LL PICK IT UP HERE
NEXT WEEK.

47:44.062 --> 47:46.231
GREAT JOB.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.473
FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME.

47:55.506 --> 47:58.676
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, HONEY,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.211
YES. I DID.

48:00.245 --> 48:02.680
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HERE YESTERDAY.

48:02.713 --> 48:06.051
WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.991
HEY.

48:13.024 --> 48:14.392
IS THAT HIM?

48:14.425 --> 48:16.261
YEAH.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.428
HE LOOKS...

48:17.462 --> 48:19.064
LIKE A DECENT GUY?

48:20.665 --> 48:21.666
IF I DIDN'T
KNOW BETTER,

48:21.699 --> 48:22.600
I WOULD THINK
THAT YOU WERE--

48:22.633 --> 48:24.069
DON'T SAY "JEALOUS."

48:24.102 --> 48:25.136
I WAS GOING TO SAY

48:25.170 --> 48:26.104
"HAVING FEELINGS
FOR HER AGAIN."

48:26.137 --> 48:27.672
DON'T SAY THAT
EITHER!

48:30.641 --> 48:34.279
BUYERS LOVE
CELEBRITY PROPERTIES.

48:34.312 --> 48:37.382
I THINK WE SHOULD PLAY UP
THE POP STAR ANGLE.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.050
DO WE REALLY
HAVE TO DO THAT?

48:39.084 --> 48:40.618
WELL, I ONCE SOLD A HOUSE
FOR DOUBLE THE COMPS,

48:40.651 --> 48:41.953
JUST BECAUSE
A REAL HOUSEWIFE,

48:41.987 --> 48:43.554
WHO SHALL
REMAIN NAMELESS,

48:43.588 --> 48:45.490
USED TO LIVE THERE.

48:46.657 --> 48:48.159
WOW...

48:48.193 --> 48:50.028
WHAT A ROOM.

48:50.061 --> 48:51.229
OH, THANK YOU.

48:51.262 --> 48:54.032
I RESTORED IT TO
ITS ORIGINAL STATE.

48:54.065 --> 48:57.135
I'D SAY WE STAGE IT,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.737
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY LIKE IT
THE WAY IT IS.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.572
IT HAS CHARACTER.

49:01.606 --> 49:02.640
IT FEELS RIGHT.

49:02.673 --> 49:04.575
FOR A COUNTRY INN.

49:06.077 --> 49:09.080
IT IS A COUNTRY INN.

49:09.114 --> 49:10.448
NOW.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.350
NOT THAT YOUR PLACE
ISN'T AMAZING,

49:12.383 --> 49:14.019
BECAUSE IT IS.

49:14.052 --> 49:14.919
BUT THE WALL STREETERS
AND THE TECHIES

49:14.952 --> 49:17.588
REALLY GO FOR
THOSE CLEAN MODERN LINES,

49:17.622 --> 49:19.290
AND THAT IS OUR TARGET MARKET.

49:19.324 --> 49:21.192
DON'T WORRY,

49:21.226 --> 49:23.061
OLIVIA IS THE BEST.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.231
LUCKY, COME ON,
GET OUT OF HERE.

49:26.264 --> 49:28.433
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
GO ON, COME ON, COME ON.

49:33.371 --> 49:35.040
UH, SORRY,

49:35.073 --> 49:36.507
JOSH ISN'T REALLY
A DOG PERSON.

49:36.541 --> 49:37.708
I WAS ATTACKED

49:37.742 --> 49:39.444
AT AN OPEN HOUSE
BY A POODLE.

49:39.477 --> 49:40.445
A TOY POODLE.

49:47.718 --> 49:49.754
I THINK I HAVE IT
FIGURED OUT.

49:49.787 --> 49:52.323
SHOULD I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY?

49:52.357 --> 49:54.259
THAT WHOLE SOMETHING OLD,
SOMETHING NEW--

49:54.292 --> 49:55.293
SOMETHING BORROWED--

49:55.326 --> 49:57.395
SOMETHING BLUE.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.331
HERE'S THE OLD.

50:00.365 --> 50:01.666
WHAT'S THAT?

50:01.699 --> 50:03.468
IT'S ONE OF
MY GRANDMOTHER'S VEILS.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.136
SHE KNEW MY MOM
WOULDN'T WEAR IT,

50:05.170 --> 50:07.238
BUT THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
SNEAK IT IN SOMEHOW.

50:07.272 --> 50:08.606
SHE'S CRAFTY.

50:08.639 --> 50:10.075
SO AM I,

50:10.108 --> 50:11.576
AND DEVIOUS.

50:11.609 --> 50:12.677
SO, WHAT'S THE "NEW"?

50:12.710 --> 50:15.080
I BOUGHT HER AN ANKLET.

50:15.113 --> 50:17.115
I'LL GIVE IT TO HER
THE DAY OF THE WEDDING.

50:17.148 --> 50:18.349
THEN YOU JUST NEED
SOMETHING BORROWED.

50:20.385 --> 50:21.419
GOT IT.

50:21.452 --> 50:23.254
SHOULD I ASK?

50:23.288 --> 50:25.056
MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ.

50:29.794 --> 50:31.196
"YOU AND ME

50:31.229 --> 50:32.730
"ON AN OPEN ROAD

50:32.763 --> 50:34.799
"THE STARS ALIGN
AND THEY GUIDE US ON

50:34.832 --> 50:36.067
"BUT WHEREVER WE GO

50:36.101 --> 50:37.835
WE ARE HOME."

50:37.868 --> 50:39.670
I LOVE IT,
WHERE'S IT FROM?

50:39.704 --> 50:41.172
MY MOM WROTE IT.

50:41.206 --> 50:42.540
SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

50:42.573 --> 50:43.608
LIKE MY DAD.

50:43.641 --> 50:46.077
SHE WROTE IT FOR YOUR DAD.

50:46.111 --> 50:48.079
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

50:48.113 --> 50:49.080
AND THERE'S MORE.

50:49.114 --> 50:50.115
HOW MUCH MORE?

50:50.148 --> 50:51.416
AN ENTIRE BOX FULL.

50:51.449 --> 50:52.617
DUKE SHOWED ME.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.219
DON'T TELL HIM
I TOLD YOU.

50:55.453 --> 50:58.656
I HAD NO CLUE.

50:58.689 --> 51:01.092
BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

51:01.126 --> 51:03.728
YOU'VE SEEN
HOW THEY'VE BEEN ACTING.

51:03.761 --> 51:05.830
I DON'T THINK
IT'S AS LONG AGO AS WE THINK.

51:05.863 --> 51:08.566
AND SO YOU'RE PUTTING THIS
IN HER BOUQUET BECAUSE?

51:08.599 --> 51:09.767
I'M CRAFTY.

51:09.800 --> 51:11.169
AND DEVIOUS.

51:11.202 --> 51:13.171
I KNOW YOU SEE IT.

51:13.204 --> 51:14.139
RIGHT?

51:15.206 --> 51:16.141
I DO.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.577
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

51:19.610 --> 51:22.113
WE WAIT.

51:22.147 --> 51:24.682
AND HOPE
NATURE TAKES ITS COURSE.

51:35.260 --> 51:36.661
WOW.

51:36.694 --> 51:38.796
IT IS BEAUTIFUL
OUT HERE, ISN'T IT?

51:38.829 --> 51:40.365
INCREDIBLE.

51:40.398 --> 51:42.833
I WONDER WHAT
THE LAKEFRONT FOOTAGE IS?

51:44.769 --> 51:45.670
JUST KIDDING.

51:47.405 --> 51:48.373
NO REAL ESTATE TALK.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.774
NO REAL ESTATE TALK.

51:53.778 --> 51:56.181
MAYBE GRACE WAS RIGHT.

51:56.214 --> 51:57.215
ABOUT WHAT?

51:57.248 --> 51:58.283
WE'RE UNROMANTIC.

51:58.316 --> 51:59.784
WE'RE NOT UNROMANTIC.

51:59.817 --> 52:01.686
I MEAN, LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE.

52:03.354 --> 52:06.591
AND WE'RE GETTING
MARRIED IN, UM...

52:07.925 --> 52:10.561
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN 46 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES.

52:10.595 --> 52:13.398
YOU SET A REMINDER
FOR OUR WEDDING?

52:13.431 --> 52:14.632
DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT.

52:16.534 --> 52:18.369
HEY...

52:18.403 --> 52:20.471
THIS IS US.

52:22.407 --> 52:24.475
YEAH.

52:24.509 --> 52:26.811
THIS IS US.

52:28.413 --> 52:30.615
I WONDER HOW FAR
THIS PATH GOES?

52:32.217 --> 52:33.584
LET'S FIND OUT.

52:34.652 --> 52:35.586
OH, HANG ON.

52:36.787 --> 52:37.855
WHAT IS IT?

52:39.457 --> 52:40.658
IT'S NOTHING.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.594
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

52:43.628 --> 52:44.962
LOCAL BROKERS.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.364
AND?

52:46.397 --> 52:48.699
WITH A TON
OF CLIENT ACCESS.

52:48.733 --> 52:49.667
BUT IT CAN WAIT.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.402
COME ON,

52:51.436 --> 52:52.837
I'LL RACE YOU AROUND THE LAKE.

52:53.871 --> 52:54.839
HEY...

52:58.309 --> 53:00.378
GO AHEAD, GO MEET 'EM.

53:03.981 --> 53:04.915
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

53:04.949 --> 53:06.083
YEAH.

53:06.116 --> 53:08.286
I MEAN, THE LAKE'S GOING TO
BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK,

53:08.319 --> 53:09.587
AND SO WILL I.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.489
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?

53:11.522 --> 53:12.957
THEN WE CAN GRAB A BITE
IN TOWN AFTER.

53:12.990 --> 53:14.559
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

53:14.592 --> 53:15.693
I THINK I'D RATHER
JUST STAY HERE.

53:15.726 --> 53:16.627
ARE YOU SURE?

53:17.695 --> 53:18.796
YEAH.

53:19.997 --> 53:20.931
LOVE YOU.

53:22.267 --> 53:23.634
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

53:25.303 --> 53:27.004
I'LL BE GONE,
LIKE, AN HOUR.

53:27.037 --> 53:28.739
TWO, TOPS.

53:30.608 --> 53:32.343
NO BIKING AND TEXTING.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.428
I KNEW IT.

53:50.461 --> 53:51.796
YOU OWE ME FIVE BUCKS.

54:00.871 --> 54:03.274
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN
AFTER YOU SELL THIS PLACE?

54:03.308 --> 54:04.709
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN
YOUR RESTAURANT.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.477
AND WHAT, YOU'LL BE
MY MAITRE D'?

54:06.511 --> 54:08.313
MAYBE.

54:08.346 --> 54:09.514
SO, YOU HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT THIS THOUGH A LOT,

54:09.547 --> 54:10.481
HAVE YOU?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.651
JUST PLAYING IT BY EAR.

54:13.684 --> 54:15.052
LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS.

54:15.085 --> 54:17.822
WHEN YOU USED TO
TAKE CHANCES.

54:19.424 --> 54:20.358
I'M JUST SAYING,

54:20.391 --> 54:22.893
YOU USED TO GO AFTER
THE THINGS YOU WANTED.

54:32.837 --> 54:33.804
OH!

54:35.573 --> 54:37.041
OH.

54:44.515 --> 54:45.850
I THINK I LIKE THIS ONE.

54:49.687 --> 54:50.955
HEY, MOM,
YOU'RE ON SPEAKER PHONE.

54:50.988 --> 54:51.989
HI, HONEY, UM...

54:52.022 --> 54:53.023
I'M ON THE LAKE PATH,

54:53.057 --> 54:54.859
AND MY CHAIN SLIPPED OFF.

54:54.892 --> 54:56.160
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW TO FIX IT,

54:56.193 --> 54:57.962
SO I'M GOING TO BE JUST
A LITTLE LATE GETTING BACK.

54:57.995 --> 54:58.896
I'LL SEND SOMEONE.

54:58.929 --> 55:01.399
NO, NO, NO, DON'T BE SILLY,
I CAN WALK.

55:01.432 --> 55:02.867
WE GOT THIS.

55:04.535 --> 55:06.504
HOW FAR DO YOU
THINK SHE GOT?

55:06.537 --> 55:07.838
FAR ENOUGH.

55:09.507 --> 55:11.308
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING RIGHT NOW?

55:20.785 --> 55:21.752
HEY.

55:22.853 --> 55:24.088
OH, HEY.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.390
SORRY.

55:25.423 --> 55:27.091
NO, IT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

55:27.124 --> 55:29.126
WELL, THANK YOU.

55:29.159 --> 55:31.596
WELL, YOU CAN JUST
CONSIDER THIS

55:31.629 --> 55:32.830
PART OF
THE CONCIERGE SERVICE.

55:32.863 --> 55:34.064
THANKS.

55:35.566 --> 55:37.101
OH, YEAH.

55:37.134 --> 55:38.836
CHAINS ARE TRICKY.

55:38.869 --> 55:39.937
YEAH.

55:42.039 --> 55:43.408
OF ALL THE PLACES FOR YOU
TO PEDAL INTO,

55:43.441 --> 55:44.842
YOU HAD TO PEDAL INTO MINE, HUH?

55:44.875 --> 55:46.110
YEAH.

55:46.143 --> 55:48.646
WELL, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
THAT THIRD-FLOOR DORM.

55:49.814 --> 55:51.115
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

55:52.182 --> 55:53.418
THERE YOU GO.

55:53.451 --> 55:54.652
THANK YOU.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.387
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE OUT HERE,

55:56.421 --> 55:57.422
THERE'S A PLACE
A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG

55:57.455 --> 55:58.523
THAT'S PRETTY SPECIAL,

55:58.556 --> 55:59.790
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT.

56:01.526 --> 56:02.760
SURE.

56:02.793 --> 56:03.861
WHY NOT?

56:06.797 --> 56:08.065
FOLLOW ME.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.846
WOW.

56:22.980 --> 56:25.149
TOLD YOU
IT WAS SPECIAL.

56:25.182 --> 56:28.619
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

56:28.653 --> 56:29.987
YEAH.

56:32.523 --> 56:36.461
I THINK THIS IS
OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE PLACE.

56:36.494 --> 56:38.729
MINE TOO.

56:40.498 --> 56:42.600
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M SAYING GOODBYE,

56:42.633 --> 56:44.769
AND YOU'RE SAYING "I DO."

56:46.170 --> 56:49.173
NOW, THAT
COULD BE A SONG.

56:54.244 --> 56:58.916
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO LET GO OF ALL THIS?

56:58.949 --> 57:01.752
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS, LIVVY.

57:03.087 --> 57:05.990
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE INN, RIGHT?

57:06.023 --> 57:07.992
I DON'T KNOW, ARE WE?

57:10.027 --> 57:11.128
I'M NOT FALLING FOR THIS AGAIN.

57:11.161 --> 57:12.162
FALLING FOR WHAT?

57:12.196 --> 57:13.263
FOR YOU.

57:13.297 --> 57:15.633
WELL, I REMEMBER YOU WERE
PRETTY HAPPY WITH ME ONCE.

57:15.666 --> 57:16.967
I REMEMBER THE TAIL-LIGHTS
OF YOUR VAN

57:17.001 --> 57:18.168
AS YOU DROVE AWAY.

57:18.202 --> 57:20.037
OH, COME ON, I HAD A TOUR.

57:20.070 --> 57:21.205
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D COME BACK FOR ME.

57:21.238 --> 57:22.540
I DID.

57:22.573 --> 57:24.809
OH, SORRY FOR NOT WAITING
TWO DECADES.

57:24.842 --> 57:26.110
TWO DECADES?

57:26.143 --> 57:27.512
IT WAS SIX MONTHS AT THE MOST.

57:27.545 --> 57:28.746
AND YOU WERE ALREADY
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.247
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

57:30.280 --> 57:31.982
YOU DIDN'T COME BACK FOR ME.

57:32.016 --> 57:33.250
YEAH, I DID.

57:33.283 --> 57:34.218
I WENT TO YOUR DORM.

57:34.251 --> 57:35.953
YOUR ROOMMATE SAID
THAT YOU'D MET SOMEONE.

57:35.986 --> 57:37.221
MY ROOMMATE?

57:37.254 --> 57:39.056
MY-- WHY WOULD YOU
BELIEVE HER?

57:39.089 --> 57:40.625
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T I?

57:40.658 --> 57:42.092
BECAUSE SHE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU,

57:42.126 --> 57:43.928
AND SHE WAS
A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR,

57:43.961 --> 57:45.663
AND IF YOU HADN'T
GIVEN UP SO EASY,

57:45.696 --> 57:48.165
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT
THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN.

57:51.802 --> 57:54.572
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THIS. I...

57:57.708 --> 57:59.710
NOTHING.

57:59.744 --> 58:01.512
I'M GOING BACK.

58:05.916 --> 58:08.753
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS WEDDING
TO BE OVER.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.767
WHAT DOES IT NEED?

58:22.800 --> 58:23.801
NOTHING.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.736
IT'S PERFECT.

58:25.770 --> 58:26.937
WELL, THANK YOU,

58:26.971 --> 58:28.973
BUT THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.942
EVERYTHING YOU'RE PREPARING
IS AMAZING.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.613
IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER.

58:35.646 --> 58:37.247
TRY THE SAUCE
THAT GOES WITH THIS.

58:44.088 --> 58:46.657
AND?

58:46.691 --> 58:48.859
ARE YOU GOING TO BE MAD
IF I SAY "AMAZING?"

58:48.893 --> 58:51.962
-YEAH.
-THEN NO COMMENT.

58:53.130 --> 58:55.132
YOU ARE LIKE YOUR MOM,

58:55.165 --> 58:56.901
VERY SWEET.

58:56.934 --> 58:58.803
TRY IT AGAIN.

59:02.339 --> 59:03.974
IT'S BETTER, RIGHT?

59:04.008 --> 59:05.275
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

59:05.309 --> 59:06.577
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

59:06.611 --> 59:09.146
DON'T EVER SETTLE.

59:09.179 --> 59:11.181
LIFE'S TOO SHORT, GRACE.

59:11.215 --> 59:14.018
WE'RE STILL TALKING
FOOD, YEAH?

59:16.721 --> 59:20.190
YOU DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD
MARRY JOSH EITHER, DO YOU?

59:20.224 --> 59:23.027
WHAT I THINK...

59:23.060 --> 59:25.329
IS THAT IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER.

59:27.397 --> 59:28.565
MM.

59:31.201 --> 59:32.737
MM-HMM.

59:35.072 --> 59:36.907
HEY...

59:36.941 --> 59:38.609
OH, HI.

59:38.643 --> 59:39.777
I'M SORRY,

59:39.810 --> 59:41.145
I KNOW THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE

59:41.178 --> 59:42.246
A WEEKEND WITHOUT
AN OPEN HOUSE.

59:42.279 --> 59:45.182
OH, HONEY, WHAT'S A WEEKEND
WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE?

59:45.215 --> 59:47.351
AFTER THE WEDDING,
WE'LL TAKE SOME TIME OFF.

59:47.384 --> 59:49.119
YOU MEAN A HONEYMOON?

59:49.153 --> 59:50.054
NOT THAT MUCH TIME.

59:51.155 --> 59:52.990
YES, A HONEYMOON.

59:53.023 --> 59:55.092
NO CELL PHONES,
OR SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS?

59:55.125 --> 59:56.093
DONE.

59:56.126 --> 59:57.962
I HAVE TO HEAD INTO TOWN
AND PICK UP THE SIGNS.

59:57.995 --> 59:59.063
YOU GOT THIS?

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.230
OH, I GOT THIS.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.833
SEE YOU SOON.

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:03.634
OKAY.

01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:08.172
-MORNING, GRACE.
-GOOD MORNING, JOSH.

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:09.139
REHEARSAL DINNER
TONIGHT.

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.174
GOT IT.

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.175
DON'T GO TOO FAR!

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.042
WOULDN'T
DREAM OF IT!

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.078
WORST GROOM EVER.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.946
SO, WHERE'S HE OFF TO?

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.014
OH, IT'S OKAY.

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:18.215
OPEN HOUSE.
HE'LL BE BACK.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.417
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
AREA RUG, YES OR NO?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.652
I LIKE THE RUG.

01:00:21.686 --> 01:00:22.720
YEAH, I DO, TOO.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:23.888
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T
SAY "WALL STREET,"

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:25.255
BUT... IT STAYS.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.068
GUILT-INDUCING?

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:44.274
LET'S LEAVE THIS
THE WAY IT IS.

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:45.175
YOU KNOW, UM...

01:00:45.209 --> 01:00:48.112
MAYBE A LITTLE
SENTIMENTALITY IS GOOD.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:51.048
BUYERS CAN SEE
THAT PEOPLE WERE HAPPY HERE.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.750
I HAVE TO SAY,

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.785
I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH THE PLACE.

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:56.420
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

01:00:56.453 --> 01:00:57.822
EXACTLY.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.192
GOOD MORNING, MICK.

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:04.061
MORNING, LADIES.

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:06.764
MORNING.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:09.867
YOU DON'T...
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME, RIGHT?

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.268
NO.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.837
NOT A THING.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.310
YOU READY?

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:22.112
YEAH.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.857
OKAY, UH...
WHERE WERE WE?

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.158
AS I RECALL,

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.827
WE WERE LEAVING EVERYTHING
EXACTLY AS IT WAS.

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.229
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:44.935
MOM...

01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:46.336
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.905
WHAT?

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:50.140
IT'S JUST...

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:51.776
YOU'RE DIFFERENT AROUND HIM.

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:53.710
HIM?

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.783
WELL, IF I AM,

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:01.819
IT'S JUST BECAUSE HE BRINGS OUT
THE WORST IN ME.

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:03.387
OR THE BEST.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.388
HONEY, I'M JUST

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.957
TRYING TO GET THROUGH
AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

01:02:06.991 --> 01:02:09.493
IT WOULDN'T BE AWKWARD
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE FEELINGS.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:13.263
NOW, THAT--
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:14.264
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:15.265
MY WEDDING PLANNER.

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:17.201
I'M ALSO YOUR DAUGHTER.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.810
AH!

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:27.144
WE SHOULD JOIN
THE WEEKEND TOURNAMENT

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:28.478
AT THE CLUB.

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:30.848
YEAH, MAYBE...

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.017
YOU SEEM DISTRACTED.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.218
I'M HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.086
MOVING ON, I GUESS.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.856
FROM THE INN, OR HER?

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:41.391
THE INN.

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:43.260
WELL, SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
TOMORROW, RIGHT?

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:44.962
YEAH.

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:46.196
OKAY, WELL THEN,
PROBLEM SOLVED.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:47.798
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

01:02:47.832 --> 01:02:50.835
OUT OF SIGHT,
OUT OF MIND.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.136
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU SELL THE INN,

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.403
WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.505
LIKE A WEEKEND AWAY SOMEWHERE?

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.074
A WEEKEND?

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.375
OR A WEEK.

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:01.011
I MEAN, WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU JUST WENT TRAVELING AROUND?

01:03:01.045 --> 01:03:02.813
A LONG TIME AGO,

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:04.448
AND IT WAS ON A TOUR BUS.

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:07.284
WELL, I'M THINKING MORE...

01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:09.153
HOTEL, AIRPLANE,

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:11.321
SANDY BEACH.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:19.964
THIS COULD BE A SWEET
CORPORATE RETREAT.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:21.131
IF WE GUT IT, YEAH.

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:22.366
EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:23.167
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THE OUTSIDE.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.569
800 FEET
OF PRIMETIME LAKEFRONT.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.441
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO AN OPEN HOUSE.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.610
I'VE BEEN TO TOO MANY.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.913
LOOKS LIKE
A BIG TURNOUT.

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:36.947
AT LEAST
HALF OF THEM ARE HERE

01:03:36.981 --> 01:03:38.015
JUST TO SEE THE PLACE,

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:40.450
AND MAYBE GRAB
SOME FREE FOOD.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:41.852
IT'S THE OTHER HALF
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:45.022
IT'S WEIRD

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:46.456
THINKING ABOUT THIS PLACE
BELONGING TO SOMEONE ELSE.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.058
OR A CORPORATION.

01:03:48.092 --> 01:03:50.194
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
IT WON'T SELL,

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:52.262
ALTHOUGH WITH
A PROPERTY LIKE THIS...

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:53.597
HOW GOOD A SALESMAN IS JOSH?

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:57.001
HE SOLD MY MOM ON MARRIAGE,
SO I'D SAY GOOD.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:01.305
I'D BETTER START
GETTING USED TO THE IDEA.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.008
THE THING IS,

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:06.076
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVE,

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:07.244
AND IT'S HARD.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:09.546
BUT YOUR DAD
WILL BE OKAY.

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:10.614
AND YOU WILL, TOO.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.216
YOU HAVE EACH OTHER.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.018
THANKS, GRACE.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:17.221
COME ON,
LET'S GRAB SOME SUSHI.

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:45.115
REHEARSAL DINNER?

01:04:45.149 --> 01:04:46.951
"OPEN HOUSE SUSHI."

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:48.919
YOU SEE ALL THOSE
PEOPLE OUT THERE?

01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:50.054
TRYING NOT TO.

01:04:50.087 --> 01:04:51.521
YEAH, ME TOO.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.559
I REMEMBER
WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PLACE.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:56.961
THERE WAS NO SUSHI,

01:04:56.994 --> 01:05:00.364
JUST AN OLD HOUSE
AND A RUSTY DOCK.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.598
AND AN EVEN
RUSTIER DRUMMER

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.500
WHO MADE GRILLED CHEESE
ON AN IRON.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.202
WHY'D YOU TAKE THAT
OFF THE MENU?

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.303
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A HOUSE FAVORITE?

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.072
MORE LIKE A DUCK FAVORITE.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.412
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.147
ABOUT WHAT?

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:40.204
SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
OUT ON THE BIKE TRAIL.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:45.009
NAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S MY FAULT.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:48.012
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I GOT SO UPSET.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:49.613
PEOPLE GET NERVOUS
AROUND WEDDINGS.

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:50.680
YEAH.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:52.482
I SEE IT ALL THE TIME.

01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:00.290
DID YOU REALLY
COME BACK FOR ME?

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.328
YEAH, I DID.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.695
THERE HE IS...

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:07.364
POP STAR IN THE FLESH.

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:08.498
WHOA-HO, HUGE FAN!

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.567
CAN I GET
A SELFIE?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.535
SURE.

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:16.006
MY MOTHER
PLAYED YOU NON-STOP

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.174
WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP.

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:18.142
YOUR MOM, HUH?

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:19.309
AND MY GRANDMOTHER.

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.045
OH, YES...

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:22.646
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN BIG
WITH THE GRANDMOTHERS.

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:25.315
I CANNOT WAIT TO TELL THEM
WHOSE PROPERTY WE'RE BUYING.

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:26.750
I THINK I JUST
HEARD AN OFFER.

01:06:29.353 --> 01:06:30.320
COME ON,

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:32.622
LET'S SHOW THEM WHERE
WE'RE GONNA TIE THE KNOT.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.524
RIGHT UP HERE, GUYS.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.136
SWEETIE?

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:50.240
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE READING THERE?

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:52.709
I WANTED TO DO
A TOAST AT THE WEDDING,

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:56.246
AND I NEEDED
SOME INSPIRATION.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.182
BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO
BE ABLE TO WRITE

01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:01.118
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:07.191
THEY REALLY
LOVED EACH OTHER,

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:08.458
DIDN'T THEY, GRANDMA?

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:10.360
OH, IT WAS
SO LONG AGO,

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.328
THEY WERE WET
BEHIND THE EARS,

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:12.429
PUPPY LOVE.

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:15.399
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:16.566
MAYBE.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.534
DEFINITELY.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:23.140
EVEN BEFORE MICK LEFT,
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM.

01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:24.174
WHY?

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:28.378
AS A MOTHER, UM,

01:07:28.412 --> 01:07:31.315
YOU WANT THE BEST FOR YOUR KIDS.

01:07:31.348 --> 01:07:33.550
SO, IF YOU SEE HEARTACHE COMING,

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:37.354
YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO JUMP IN AND DEFLECT IT.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.523
READING THESE,

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.291
I'M GUESSING
SHE GOT HIT ANYWAY.

01:07:41.325 --> 01:07:43.227
WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.361
IS PASSED,

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.463
AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.565
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT JOSH NOW.

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:51.101
BUT WHAT IF HE'S NOT
THE RIGHT ONE?

01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:52.202
AND WHAT IF HE IS?

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.308
TELL YOU WHAT...

01:08:00.344 --> 01:08:02.712
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
MAKE THE TOAST, HMM?

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.549
IF YOU THINK OF SOMETHING,
YOU CAN ADD ON.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:08.852
IT'S JUST ONE LESS THING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.399
FOLKS...

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.202
I'VE GOT A CHOIR GROUP
IN AN HOUR.

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.303
WHERE'S OUR GROOM?

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.804
HE'S...
HE'S ON A CALL.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.506
HE WON'T BE LONG.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.541
PERHAPS WE COULD USE
A STAND-IN UNTIL HE GETS HERE?

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:32.841
OH, YES,
JOHNNY WILL DO IT.

01:08:32.876 --> 01:08:33.910
GO ON.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.212
I KINDA MADE A VOW

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:36.180
NEVER TO WALK DOWN
ANOTHER AISLE, SO...

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:40.384
AND I'M JUST HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.886
MICK, YOU DO IT.

01:08:42.919 --> 01:08:45.622
UNFORTUNATELY
I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.392
DAD, GET UP THERE.

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:49.526
THE REVEREND HAS TO LEAVE.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:54.663
COME ON.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:09.379
AND... MUSIC.

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:30.466
WE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER
TO UNITE A COUPLE IN LOVE.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.901
OBVIOUSLY,
THE BRIDE AND GROOM

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:33.937
WILL BE STANDING
A LITTLE CLOSER.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.604
CLOSER.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:38.875
CLOSER.

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:44.314
THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD.

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:46.550
I BELIEVE
YOU'VE WRITTEN YOUR OWN VOWS.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.852
UH, ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T
QUITE FINISHED MINE.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:49.986
YOU REALLY HAVEN'T FINISHED?

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.555
NO.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.921
SORRY, IT'S JUST,

01:09:52.956 --> 01:09:55.625
YOU USED TO WRITE
ENTIRE SONGS FASTER.

01:09:55.659 --> 01:09:58.962
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THOSE WORDS WERE MEANINGLESS.

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.897
OH, OUCH.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:01.865
DOES THE STAND-IN
HAVE TO TALK?

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:03.800
PERHAPS WE'RE GETTING
A LITTLE OFF TRACK.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.402
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SONG?

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:06.403
YEAH, THAT'S ME AGAIN.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:07.337
WE'LL SKIP OVER THAT.

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:08.505
RINGS?

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.240
THE GROOM
HAS THE RINGS.

01:10:10.274 --> 01:10:11.641
AND THEN, OF COURSE,

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:13.443
DOES ANYONE OBJECT
TO THIS UNION...

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:18.982
JUST STRETCHING,
THAT'S ALL.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.584
SIT DOWN.

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:21.685
MOVING ALONG,

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:22.652
I'LL PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE,

01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:24.354
AND YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:27.591
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:28.658
WELL, YOU DON'T
WANT TO ARGUE

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:30.727
WITH A MAN OF GOD, DO YOU?

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.928
SORRY,
EVERYONE!

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:37.967
YOU MUST BE
THE GROOM.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.336
I APOLOGIZE FOR
THE DELAY, REVEREND,

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:40.704
BUT I HAVE
SOME GREAT NEWS.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.406
TWO OFFERS.
BOTH OVER ASK.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.574
ALL CASH, 30-DAY ESCROW.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:46.009
30 DAYS?

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:48.011
WELL, I COULD PUSH
FOR 15 DAYS IF YOU WANT.

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:51.848
NO, I WAS THINKING OF PUSHING
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.317
IF YOU LET THEM
SLEEP ON IT,

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.885
THEY MIGHT NOT SLEEP IN IT.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:56.886
AND WITH THE PROFIT
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE,

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.922
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU
THE PLACE OF YOUR DREAMS.

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:02.559
BUT THIS WAS
THE PLACE OF MY DREAMS.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.761
THERE ARE ALWAYS
BIGGER DREAMS.

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:05.829
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:10.967
WELL, I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS
IS IN ORDER FOR BOTH OF US.

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:19.743
OKAY, YOU TWO.

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:22.512
MAYBE A BRIDE AND GROOM KISS?

01:11:22.546 --> 01:11:23.547
OH, YES.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.514
SURE. GOOD IDEA.

01:11:24.548 --> 01:11:25.582
GREAT.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.651
OH, HANG ON, MY PHONE.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.953
SORRY, I FORGOT
TO SHUT OFF MY PHONE.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:31.655
YEAH, I'LL TURN IT OFF.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:32.689
GOOD, ALL RIGHT.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.424
OKAY.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.630
WOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A REHEARSAL DINNER.

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:41.665
LET'S EAT!

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:43.400
OH, HEY, MICK.

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:44.868
I'LL HAVE THOSE PAPERS
DRAWN UP AFTER THE WEDDING.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:47.471
YOU KNOW, I THINK
OUR BEING HERE WAS FATE.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:49.973
MAYBE.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:53.009
IT'S LOOKING LIKE OURS
WILL BE THE LAST WEDDING HERE.

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:56.012
TO MARRIAGES AND MORTGAGES.

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.681
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
PAYING FOR BOTH OF THEM

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.849
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:05.088
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST.

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.823
OLIVIA...

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.759
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
CRITICAL OF YOU.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:12.396
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM.

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:14.431
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
TOGETHER, SWEETHEART.

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:17.434
MOM, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING WITH THIS?

01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:19.436
I'M APOLOGIZING.

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:22.606
I'VE BEEN MARRIED A FEW TIMES,

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:24.974
AS A LOT OF YOU KNOW,

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:28.578
BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE RIGHT ONE.

01:12:28.612 --> 01:12:31.047
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL,
BEAUTIFUL,

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.416
SMART WOMAN,
OLIVIA,

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:35.452
AND I'M
SO PROUD OF YOU.

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:39.423
AND IN THE END,
YOU ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:41.791
HEAR, HEAR.

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:43.693
TO OLIVIA.

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:44.894
TO OLIVIA.

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.463
THANK YOU, MOM.

01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:55.739
I KNOW YOU GUYS WANTED
TO DO THIS AT THE COURTHOUSE,

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:57.507
BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:58.875
THAT WE'RE ALL
HERE TOGETHER

01:12:58.908 --> 01:13:00.744
IN THIS AMAZING PLACE,

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:02.446
EVEN IF YOU DID MANAGE

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.548
TO SQUEEZE IN AN OPEN HOUSE.

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:07.183
MOM, YOU
ALWAYS TOLD ME

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.753
TO FOLLOW MY HEART.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:12.989
TO FOLLOWING YOURS.

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:15.992
THANK YOU, HONEY.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.463
I KNOW

01:13:19.496 --> 01:13:20.964
I'M NOT PART OF THE FAMILY,

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:23.600
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I AM TONIGHT.

01:13:23.633 --> 01:13:25.802
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF
WEDDINGS HERE,

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:28.638
BUT THIS ONE IS SPECIAL
FOR A LOT OF REASONS.

01:13:28.672 --> 01:13:31.441
I WISH YOU BOTH THE VERY BEST.

01:13:31.475 --> 01:13:33.543
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:13:33.577 --> 01:13:34.944
THANK YOU.

01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:39.182
DAD, YOU SHOULD
MAKE A TOAST.

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:40.717
ME? NO!

01:13:42.686 --> 01:13:44.588
DAD...

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:45.989
MICK, PLEASE.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:48.492
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
TO ALL OF US.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:54.464
UM...

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:57.801
WELL, AS PART OF OLIVIA'S PAST,

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:58.935
IT'S...

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:01.538
IT'S AN HONOR
TO MEET HER FUTURE.

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:04.207
JOSH, YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.445
WHEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER...

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:14.718
...I FEEL SICK.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.821
BECAUSE YOU NEVER THINK,

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:18.788
AT 19,

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:20.223
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:21.725
I SHOULD HAVE
FOUGHT FOR YOU THEN, LIVVY,

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.059
BUT I MESSED UP,

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.061
AND I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH YOU
SLIP AWAY AGAIN.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:26.963
WE BELONG TOGETHER.
DON'T MARRY HIM!

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:27.931
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.032
I'M SORRY.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.567
BUT I LOVE HER.
I ALWAYS HAVE--

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.701
JOSH!

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.177
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.246
HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
HIT ME HARDER.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:46.916
I WAS WRONG
ABOUT YOU, MICK.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:49.686
I'M SO SORRY.

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.866
HERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.

01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:05.034
THANKS.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:11.741
I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOODBYE.

01:15:11.775 --> 01:15:12.776
HOW'S YOUR DAD?

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:13.943
HE'LL BOUNCE BACK.

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:15.144
ALWAYS DOES.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:16.913
I'M SURE THE DUCKS
WILL HELP HIM THROUGH IT.

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:18.214
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.949
SHE'LL SURVIVE.

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:22.051
WE'RE JUST HEADING OUT,

01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:23.787
I'M GUESSING A WEDDING
WOULD BE A HARD SELL

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.954
AT THIS POINT.

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:26.556
I'D IT'S ON HOLD AT LEAST.

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:29.192
MOST LIKELY A VENUE CHANGE
IF ANYTHING.

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:30.627
UNDERSTANDABLE.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.598
I WISH THINGS
ENDED DIFFERENTLY.

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:35.732
ME TOO.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.567
GROUP HUG.

01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:40.203
YOU HAVE MY EMAIL
AND MY NUMBER.

01:15:40.236 --> 01:15:41.270
FRIEND ME.

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:36.826
I'M SO SORRY, MOM.

01:16:41.898 --> 01:16:43.399
I JUST WANTED THINGS
TO BE ROMANTIC FOR YOU.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.334
I KNOW, HONEY.

01:16:45.368 --> 01:16:46.836
IT'S OKAY.

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:49.105
IT WAS AWFUL.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:57.113
YOU KNOW, HONEY...

01:16:57.146 --> 01:16:58.014
IT WASN'T.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:04.287
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
THE PAST FEW DAYS,

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.025
AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE REALIZED
THAT I'VE BEEN STAGING MY LIFE,

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:10.827
AND NOT LIVING IT.

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.096
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO STAGE YOURS, TOO.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:15.999
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE THE NEW ME.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.837
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.206
GO FIND YOURSELF,
SWEETHEART.

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:25.675
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN
WANT TO BE A WEDDING PLANNER.

01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:27.110
AFTER THIS WEEKEND?

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.277
I DOUBT IT.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:30.847
COME HERE.

01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:33.950
I LOVE YOU.

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.652
I LOVE YOU.

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:40.323
WELL...

01:17:40.356 --> 01:17:43.960
IT'S STILL OFFICIALLY
MY WEDDING DAY, AND...

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.295
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:49.165
DINNER AND A SAPPY MOVIE?

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:52.035
I WOULD LOVE TO.

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.012
IT'S JOSH.

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:08.885
HEY.

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:10.419
LEMON CAKE?

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:12.288
WHY NOT?

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.258
YOU OKAY?

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:17.260
I'M HANGING IN THERE.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:19.095
I'M PROUD OF YOU, DAD.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:21.497
I RUINED A WEDDING,
AND I LOST THE GIRL.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.966
YOU TOOK A RISK.

01:18:22.999 --> 01:18:24.801
AND FAILED EPICALLY.

01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:27.370
NOT IN MY EYES.

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:32.241
YOU KNOW, MY COLLEGE
ISN'T THAT FAR AWAY.

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:33.943
YOU CAN VISIT ME ANYTIME.

01:18:33.977 --> 01:18:36.145
AND YOU CAN
VISIT HOME ANYTIME.

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:38.748
THANKSGIVING
AT YOUR NEW PLACE?

01:18:38.782 --> 01:18:41.084
THANKSGIVING HERE.

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:42.385
I'M NOT SELLING.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.653
REALLY?

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:48.091
WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND
A PLACE ANY BETTER THAN THIS?

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:50.326
I LOVE YOU.

01:18:52.195 --> 01:18:53.797
YOU'RE THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DAD.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.465
AND I'VE GOT A TROPHY
TO PROVE IT.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:25.194
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.332
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.269
I'M REALLY SORRY.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:34.337
I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.139
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING
TO THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:37.406
ANYTIME SOON.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.043
PROBABLY NOT.

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:41.911
UNLESS YOU HAVE A LISTING
NEAR THE COURTHOUSE?

01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:43.146
IS THERE ONE?

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:49.585
WE ARE GOOD TOGETHER, OLIVIA.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.888
WE ARE.

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:53.222
AT WORK.

01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:55.158
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH.

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:58.427
SO DID I.

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.063
BUT IT'S NOT,

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.931
FOR EITHER OF US.

01:20:03.066 --> 01:20:04.400
HEY, YOU TWO.

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:05.568
SO...

01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:07.570
I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER?

01:20:07.603 --> 01:20:09.238
NO, THAT...

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:10.606
RECENTLY
FELL OUT OF ESCROW.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.441
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.510
IT'S ALL GOOD.

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.545
WELL, THE REASON
I CALLED YOU BOTH

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:19.215
IS THAT I'VE DECIDED
TO LIST AFTER ALL.

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.350
REALLY?

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:23.052
I MEAN, THE PLACE IS AMAZING,

01:20:23.086 --> 01:20:24.353
AND OLIVIA,
IT'S NEVER LOOKED BETTER,

01:20:24.387 --> 01:20:25.855
BUT...

01:20:25.889 --> 01:20:27.924
IT JUST DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE ME ANYMORE.

01:20:29.058 --> 01:20:30.426
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.395
BRUCE, I HAVE
A GREAT LISTING

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:33.529
THAT JUST CAME ON THE MARKET.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.364
KILLER VIEWS,
3,200 SQUARE FEET.

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:36.465
WHEN YOU SEE IT,

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:39.903
YOU'RE GONNA FORGET
THAT YOU LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:43.940
AND HE'S BACK.

01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:46.509
...IT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:47.510
HEY!

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:49.212
DRINK UP.

01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:50.947
WE GOT A GIG.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:53.082
DON'T TELL ME YOU BOOKED
ANOTHER WEDDING?

01:20:53.116 --> 01:20:54.183
NO, A CLUB.

01:20:54.217 --> 01:20:55.218
TWO NIGHTS.

01:20:55.251 --> 01:20:56.986
AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO,
THINK OF ALL THE PERKS.

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:57.987
POOR PAY,

01:20:58.021 --> 01:20:59.255
POOR HOURS,

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:00.957
ALL WE CAN DRINK.

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.191
I'M IN.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:03.426
YEAH.

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:04.360
IT'S BEEN A LONG
TIME, BUDDY.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.002
MOM, YOU READY?

01:21:13.036 --> 01:21:14.103
COMING!

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:21.244
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:23.279
THANK YOU.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:25.348
AND BY THE WAY,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DINNER,

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.449
OR A MOVIE.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:28.684
WE'RE NOT?

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.486
NOPE. COME ON.

01:21:40.496 --> 01:21:42.231
YOU MADE IT!

01:21:42.265 --> 01:21:44.000
WE DID.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:45.068
OLIVIA, YOU LOOK...

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:46.402
LIKE HER OLD SELF.

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:48.404
"OLD?"

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:49.672
NEW "OLD."

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:51.307
COME ON,

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.641
I SAVED YOU SOME SEATS UP FRONT.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:58.014
WEDDING'S OFF.

01:21:58.047 --> 01:21:59.548
