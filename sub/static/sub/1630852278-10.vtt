WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.502
- And then you throw
the ball at them.

00:02.502 --> 00:03.878
- How do you what do you mean,
throw the ball?

00:03.878 --> 00:06.006
- You throw the ball while on
the phone. You can just at the
bottom

00:08.299 --> 00:11.720
Bear Down, Bear Down,
Bear Down, Bear Down, Bear Down.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.680
- Aw, come on, man.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.807
You brought Michelob?
Get that out of here, man.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.308
- Why?

00:17.308 --> 00:19.144
- Can't drink Michelob
during a Bears game.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.729
It's bad luck.
You gotta drink Bud.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.772
- But we drink
Mick all the time.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.316
- Yeah, during Cubs games.

00:25.316 --> 00:28.194
Bud is Bears, Michelob is Cubs,
and Molson is Hawks.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.654
I mean, you guys know this.
Come on.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.698
We gotta get these out
of here, guys. Come on.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.742
- So you really
think that the beer

00:33.742 --> 00:35.577
determines whether or not
the Bears win or lose?

00:35.577 --> 00:38.538
- I don't think, okay?
I know for a fact.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.666
We need to replicate exactly
what it was we did

00:41.666 --> 00:44.711
at the beginning of a Bears game
when I won a big Bears bet.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.838
Okay, so, Ed, I'm pretty sure
you were in the bathroom.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.215
And, Coop, you were at home

00:49.215 --> 00:51.134
having anniversary
sex with Julie, right?

00:51.134 --> 00:53.136
- I don't remember
being in any bathroom.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.221
- No, yeah, you were. 'Cause
we were at the Three of Darts,

00:55.221 --> 00:58.058
and you had the squirts, so you
went to the bathroom to go take
a shit.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.018
- Yeah, no, I went outside
to get fresh air.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.479
- Uh-huh.
So then go outside.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.939
- Well, I wasn't outside here. I
was outside at the Three of
Darts.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.025
- I think outside
is outside, man.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.820
- No, that's that's that living
in the past shit right there.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.156
I don't do that no more, okay?
This is a new age right here.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.824
- Okay.
I get that.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.576
Totally get that.
It makes sense.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.621
You don't wanna live
in the past anymore.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.999
But don't you
wanna win this bet?

01:22.999 --> 01:25.710
Right now?

01:25.710 --> 01:28.088
- Oh, you motherfucker.
- Wow.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.757
- Yeah. Coop, go home
and fuck your wife.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.802
Ed, get outside.
- Hal, cut the shit, all right?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.471
Just put the game on.
Let's just watch the game.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.099
- What, you don't have any Bud
here? - No, dude.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.683
That was supposed to
be your guys's job.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.603
- Look, we can't watch football
without beer.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.898
You don't wanna drink the beers
that we brought.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.192
- Yeah.
Ooh.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.485
Hilda.
She's got a fridge full of beer.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.320
She'll have Bud.
- Hilda?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.697
- Yeah, my upstairs neighbor.
That old ass lady.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.533
She's in the hospital,
so I'm watching her cats.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.202
- You got an old ass lady living
upstairs with a fridge full of
beer?

01:59.202 --> 02:01.454
- Yeah, man.
She's a raging alcoholic.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.915
Falls down the stairs like
clockwork. That's why she's in
the hospital.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.667
- Does she know you
steal her beers?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.211
- I'm watching her cats, okay?

02:08.211 --> 02:11.256
Don't try to make
this a negative, man.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.384
Ooh, also, she's got one of
those heated, squishy toilet
seats up there,

02:14.384 --> 02:16.886
so if you gotta back one out,

02:16.886 --> 02:20.181
it's a good place to do it.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.516
- And where are you going?

02:21.516 --> 02:23.518
- Hilda's.
I gotta back one out.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.063
- And so you just hear
the words, "Back one out,"

02:27.063 --> 02:28.857
and all of a sudden, you gotta
you gotta back one out?

02:28.857 --> 02:31.484
- He got lucky.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.863
- Hear that, Ed?
My luck's running good, my man.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.490
My luck is running real good.

02:37.490 --> 02:42.328
- ♪ Now now now now now ♪

02:42.328 --> 02:45.999
- How is that not holding?
How is that not fucking holding?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.251
- It's not holding, dude.
- How can you say that?

02:48.251 --> 02:51.171
I'm trying to win Ed money
here. - All right, calm down,
okay?

02:51.171 --> 02:54.674
The now, it's it's about
accepting everything that
happens, good or bad.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.676
And that was definitely
not a penalty so we live with
it.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.803
- Oh, fuck off.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.181
- Hal, we're only down by three.
We're gonna win the bet.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.474
It's 2nd and 20.
I mean, we're in great shape.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.101
- 2nd down and 20.

03:05.101 --> 03:08.104
Carolina's back to pass.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.856
Oh, he's got a man
- Come on!

03:09.856 --> 03:13.610
Why are you throwing?
You're up!

03:13.610 --> 03:15.904
- Wait wait wait, maybe
maybe it's the bottles.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.031
I mean, last time, I think we
we had cans, right?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.073
And we poured them
into the cups.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.868
- Oh, fuck.
Eddie's right.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.912
- Hurry hurry!
- Here, here.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.413
Pour your beer in your cup.
- This is bullshit.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.165
- Fucking just do it!
- Bears will get a shot

03:27.165 --> 03:29.125
- Guys, Carolina's just gonna
run the clock out.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.794
There's nothing to worry about.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.672
- Carolina hands the ball off
and big hole!

03:34.672 --> 03:36.341
- Tackle, tackle!
- No, no, no.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.759
- Carolina goes for
- Come on.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.220
Damn it, Coop.
This is all your fault, man.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.096
- How is that my fault?
- How is it your fault?

03:42.096 --> 03:44.098
All you had to do is go home
and bang Julie.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.309
- Yo, is that too much to ask?
- Both of you, fucking drop it.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.311
- No, man.
Ed's outside.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.439
Why couldn't you just go home
and bang your wife?

03:51.439 --> 03:54.150
- Fucking drop it, Hal. -
Seriously, all you had to do was
do it.

03:54.150 --> 03:57.237
Why couldn't you just go bang
your wife? - Because she fucking
left me!

03:57.237 --> 04:00.782
- Oh, what a block! What a
horrible play by the Bears.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.368
And that's it, folks.
The game is over.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.453
Bears cannot come back...
-

04:05.453 --> 04:07.622
- From giving
up a touchdown.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.290
- Wait.
Don't move.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.417
Stay outside.
They might review it.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.545
- And Carolina just marched
down the field on them.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.673
- Coop, I'm so sorry, man.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.633
- I don't wanna
talk about it, Hal.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.011
- I had no idea.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.139
- It's 'cause I
didn't tell anybody.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.558
-
Fuck.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.812
- Good news is, when she left,

04:30.812 --> 04:33.606
she left the
engagement ring, so.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.941
I guess you can have it.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.736
- Fuck, man.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.658
I mean, I kinda wish you had
mentioned the thing about the
engagement ring

04:43.658 --> 04:45.660
four hours ago, before
I made that bet.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.287
It would've saved
me a fucking bundle.

04:54.752 --> 04:58.172
- So where did Julie
and the girls go?

04:58.172 --> 05:01.676
- Moved them in back
with their parents, so.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.970
I'm fixing this place up,
so I can sell it.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.930
And move in with you.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.182
- Oh, um...

05:08.182 --> 05:09.892
Yeah, of course, no,
whatever you need, man.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.519
- I'm just fucking with you,
man. The ring is in here.

05:16.858 --> 05:20.069
- Wow.
That is one meaty vibrator.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.698
- It's yours if you want it.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.908
- Okay, I don't really know
what I'm gonna do with that.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.246
- The ring, Ed.
- Right.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.296
Yeah, are you sure about this?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.506
- Yeah, man.
Just, uh just take it.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.053
I fucked up, Ed.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.347
All right, I've...

05:47.347 --> 05:49.974
I fucked up real bad.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.477
I fucked up with Julie.
I

05:52.477 --> 05:54.979
My kids.
My babies.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.901
How could I do
this shit to them?

06:02.153 --> 06:04.447
- I'm sure it's not
all your fault, man.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.282
- I cheated.

06:06.282 --> 06:10.203
- Kay.
Shit

06:10.203 --> 06:12.789
Okay, but these these things
don't happen in a vacuum.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.290
There must have been
other issues, right?

06:14.290 --> 06:16.709
- Not really.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.003
Everybody has issues.
But us?

06:21.130 --> 06:22.965
Nothing was major.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.717
And I fucked that up

06:24.717 --> 06:27.720
for some chick at some
convention in San Diego.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.640
Her husband finds out,
and he tells Julie.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.392
And now my life is over.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.435
Ruined.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.895
'Cause I'm a fucking idiot.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.859
- Are you you wanna get her
back, right? - Hell yeah.

06:41.859 --> 06:43.528
- Okay, so what are you doing
to show her that?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.196
- I'm trying.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.032
I am.
I'm trying.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.243
But what's the point?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.495
I did it.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.205
She ain't gonna forgive
me for this shit.

07:00.044 --> 07:03.548
- Look, I don't wanna be
annoying with this now shit,
but...

07:03.548 --> 07:05.633
But Eckhart says that, um,

07:05.633 --> 07:08.886
that life will give you
whatever experience is

07:08.886 --> 07:10.346
most helpful for the evolution
of your consciousness.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.018
- What the fuck does that mean,
Ed? - I have no fucking idea.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.647
But my interpretation is

07:19.647 --> 07:21.649
we all fuck up.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.402
And the important thing
is how you learn from it.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.616
- Yeah.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.808
- Hello?
- Eddo.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.728
- No.
- Don't lie to me, you fuck.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.355
- Oh, Ed.
Yeah, no, I'm I'm Ed.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.232
And who might this be?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.818
- It's your buddy, Joon-Ho.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.361
- Joon-Ho.
Hey, what's up, man?

08:07.361 --> 08:10.281
How are you?
- Dandy.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.409
Look, I wanna remind you we got
a playdate in about one hour.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.619
You're gonna be
there, right?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.579
- Of course.
You know it.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.582
- Good, I don't want you to have
to see Stinky and his friend
again.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.542
You're gonna bring
what you need to bring, right?

08:21.542 --> 08:24.587
- Of course, yeah.
- Cool, cool.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.130
- All right.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.715
Well, I gotta do a
couple errands first,

08:27.715 --> 08:30.092
so I might be a
few minutes late.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.928
But rest
assured, I will be there.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.888
- Okay.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.225
- See you soon, Eddo.
- Bye.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.533
- Yeah.
-

08:53.533 --> 08:55.868
What what up, Hally?

08:55.868 --> 08:57.495
- Hey, man.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.164
What what are you what are you
doing here, like, in person?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.460
- Stinky had to take a personal
day. - Oh.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.130
Um, okay, look.
I know I know Tuesday's payday.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.549
But I'm I'm gonna need
a little bit more time.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.676
Not long.
- Oh.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.636
Okay, okay.
Cool.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.055
That's no sweat.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.308
But I'm just gonna need, like,
a grand right now.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.977
You know, as a
show of good faith.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.604
- Yeah, right.
It's just, um...

09:23.604 --> 09:27.567
Even that grand is just gonna be
a little bit tough right now.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.195
I just I just paid
my kid's tuition.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.114
- So
- Uh, your kids?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.866
Well.
