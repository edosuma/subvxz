That's why we're here.
- But, Dad, Fiskerton just

00:36.537 --> 00:37.954

Yeah, I get that a lot.

We're big fans.

We worked with your Grandpa

You guys track down all

like that Chupacabra

- Ben: Chupacabra?

Come on, Chupacabras aren't real.

01:47.475 --> 01:50.776
Says the dude with the
magic watch that turns him

01:50.778 --> 01:53.446

- Ben: Wha... magic?

01:53.448 --> 01:59.051
Science. Way more real than
crypto-whatitses. [beeping]

01:59.053 --> 02:02.555
Sorry, Ben, but these
Chupacabras are Cryptids,

02:02.557 --> 02:05.224
and they're attacking
Bellwood's alien population.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.360
Ben: We know.
My partner and I have been

02:07.362 --> 02:09.794
tracking them for a week.
This is the first time we

02:09.797 --> 02:11.081
actually caught up with one.

02:11.082 --> 02:13.086
Hopefully, Rook has
caught it by now.

02:13.117 --> 02:15.977
[breathing heavily]
I did not.

02:16.969 --> 02:17.870
Hello.

02:17.872 --> 02:20.706
You must be the Saturdays.
Thank you for coming.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.742
Ben: Huh?
You knew they were coming?

02:22.744 --> 02:25.344
Rook: Magister Tennyson
called them due to their

02:25.346 --> 02:28.247
cryptozoological expertise.
Although, I have made an

02:28.249 --> 02:31.150
extensive study of all
life-forms on Earth, and I am

02:31.152 --> 02:33.386
certain that Chupacabras do not exist.

02:33.388 --> 02:36.489
That's because of us.
- It's our job to make sure

02:36.491 --> 02:39.258
Cryptids stay hidden
for their own protection.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.894
Rook: That makes sense.
- Ben: It does?

02:41.896 --> 02:44.163
Am I the only sane one around here?

02:44.165 --> 02:47.733
[device whirring]
[device beeping]

02:47.735 --> 02:50.269
<i>So, the Chupacabras took up sculpting?</i>

02:50.271 --> 02:55.207
Rook: It's not a statue,
Ben. It has a pulse.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.943
And this wound is consistent
with the reports from

02:57.945 --> 03:00.379
the previous alien attacks.
- We'll take him up to the

03:00.381 --> 03:03.179

need our own airship.

Rook: We already have a
spaceship and an underground

03:19.600 --> 03:22.034

- Oh [chuckles] right back at ya.

03:48.496 --> 03:52.115
Dude, that's my Mom.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.874
Ben: Do Cryptids have any
special powers, you know,

03:54.962 --> 03:57.069
like my aliens?
- Some do.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.106
I can show you more about them,
but you can't tell my folks.

04:00.108 --> 04:02.499
Ben: You're not hiding the
lock ness monster up here,

04:02.526 --> 04:04.944
are you?
'Cause that would be awesome!

04:04.946 --> 04:06.946
No way.
We'd never take Nessie out of

04:06.948 --> 04:11.150
her natural habitat.
- Ben: Oh, totally awful ...

04:11.152 --> 04:13.953
so wrong.
[robotic laughter]

04:13.955 --> 04:16.622
Rook: "Weird world"?
- Ben: Oh, yeah, I remember

04:16.624 --> 04:18.824
that show. It had
that dude in the creepy mask.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.192
V.V. Argost.

04:20.194 --> 04:23.362
Ben: Yeah, it was on against
"Sumo Slammers,"

04:23.364 --> 04:25.831
so I never watched it.
- I never saw "Sumo Slammers."

04:25.833 --> 04:28.219
It's too hard to catch up on TV
when you're saving

04:28.346 --> 04:31.170
the world all the time.
- Ben: I know, right?

04:31.172 --> 04:34.340
And every time I'm just about
to get past level 12 in

04:34.342 --> 04:36.388
"Sumo Slammers: World tournament,"
some bonehead alien

04:36.418 --> 04:39.378
tries to destroy the
universe or something.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.281
Rook: Yes, it must be
difficult for you not being able

04:42.283 --> 04:46.318
to watch your favorite programs.
- Ben: He grew up on a farm ...

04:46.320 --> 04:48.154
a very serious farm.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.989
[electronic whirring]

04:49.991 --> 04:53.192
No internal injuries.
Organs are functional.

04:53.194 --> 04:56.729
He's just a rock.
What does that do?

04:56.731 --> 04:59.398
It's a potion made
from Tibetan sea beads.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.898
It expels evil spirits.
I know that look.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.743
Just because one remedy didn't
work doesn't mean

05:05.809 --> 05:09.742
there's not a mystical solution.
- You keep applying your

05:09.744 --> 05:14.061
potions and elixirs while
I try doing some science.

Rook: Argost is gone, correct?
Was it a Cryptid that

05:23.800 --> 05:27.428
destroyed him?
- Actually, it was me.

05:27.441 --> 05:31.230
Turns out he was really an evil
yeti out to destroy humanity.

05:31.232 --> 05:34.600
I zapped him out of existence
when he tried to combine my

05:34.602 --> 05:37.503
kur power with antimatter
from an alternate universe.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.905
Ben: Yeah, you lost me at "zapped."

05:39.907 --> 05:42.266
Let's just say he was my nemesis,
but he made

05:42.345 --> 05:45.044
an awesome TV show.
This episode ...

05:45.046 --> 05:47.411
[alarm blaring]
There's been an attack at an

05:52.520 --> 05:55.454
I'll stay behind and keep
an eye on the lizard man.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.158
Ben: Whoa, whoa, don't be so hasty.

05:57.274 --> 06:01.293
Rook, you stay. We may
need Zak's mom's medi...

06:01.295 --> 06:03.929
medi... uh,
you know, what she's got.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.466
We should all go. These
Chupacabras are dangerous.

Ben: Right, no doubt.

Beetafangs in stock?

It worked!
Our plan is an unmitigated success!

08:21.314 --> 08:22.651
V.V. Argost: I seem to recall

08:22.653 --> 08:25.954
it being my plan. I gave
you the blueprints for

08:25.956 --> 08:29.157
this machine before my
unfortunate run-in with

08:29.159 --> 08:31.927
Zak Saturday. [chuckles]

08:31.929 --> 08:35.664
What is this?!
I explicitly asked for a yeti

08:35.666 --> 08:38.600
body, not some
collage of Cryptid parts.

08:38.602 --> 08:43.638
Dr. Animo: I took the liberty
of making some modifications.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.642
I used the Chupacabras to drain
the life force needed to power

08:47.644 --> 08:52.812
the machine. It's been
a productive three years.

08:52.847 --> 08:55.183
V.V. Argost: Three years?!

08:55.185 --> 08:57.652
You were supposed to
bring me back in a month!

08:57.654 --> 09:02.257
What was the hold-up, Mr. Animo?
- Dr. Animo: Ben Tennyson, and

09:02.259 --> 09:04.926
it's Dr. Animo!
- V.V. Argost: Yes, and I'm

09:04.928 --> 09:08.964
sure that came from an
accredited university.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.866
Well, it has been a rude awakening.

09:11.868 --> 09:16.461

Zak Saturday to dispose of.

09:16.496 --> 09:17.939
[clears throat]

09:17.941 --> 09:22.711
With all due respect, I'd like

of this partnership.
[ Chupacabra chitters]

help me find the world's most
exotic animals for me to...

09:36.627 --> 09:39.694
improve.
- V.V. Argost: Put a pin in

09:39.696 --> 09:43.198
that one. I want to
take my new body for

09:43.200 --> 09:46.841

I used to be better at it
before I destroyed Argost.

09:56.546 --> 10:00.032
I thought my powers were
totally gone, but Mom says

10:00.033 --> 10:03.518
I have some sort of residual,
mystical something or other.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.820
So, how does the Omnitrix work, anyway?

Mr. Tennyson.
- Ben: You know, your show

is admittedly rad, but we're

10:51.935 --> 10:54.069

you like the new me?

I admit I was not taken with
my new form at first,

11:04.841 --> 11:08.783

11:25.178 --> 11:29.622
That was just the warm-up.
- Now it's time for the main event.

11:31.678 --> 11:33.475
[shrieks]

11:33.477 --> 11:37.217
[grunts]

11:37.814 --> 11:41.516
Unh!
Unh!

11:45.829 --> 11:51.493
Nice try!
[roars]

11:51.495 --> 11:55.864
[Chupacabras shrieking]
[shouts]

11:55.866 --> 11:58.166
<i>- Unh!
- Dr. Animo: Testing your new</i>

11:58.168 --> 12:00.935
<i>body in public was not the best idea!</i>

12:00.937 --> 12:04.372
[grunts]
[Chupacabras chittering]

12:08.762 --> 12:11.679
[beeping]
Ben: Argost is working

12:11.681 --> 12:12.847
with Animo?
- Animo?

12:12.849 --> 12:15.850
Ben: Mad scientist ...
likes to experiment on animals,

12:15.852 --> 12:18.783
strictly a B-grade villain.
[tires screech]

12:19.856 --> 12:22.857
We can still catch them!
Fisk can go from zero to 60

12:22.859 --> 12:26.161
without breaking a sweat.
- Ben: Rook, we need a trike.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.697
Rook: You have a motorcycle.
- I'd trade the trike and the

12:29.699 --> 12:32.867
airship for some credit the
next time I save the world.

12:32.869 --> 12:36.304
Every time I stop a Cryptid
invasion, they say it's tornado

12:36.306 --> 12:39.507
damage or something.
- V.V. Argost: Careful, you're

12:39.509 --> 12:43.077
not darning a sock.
This patchwork quilt you call

12:43.079 --> 12:46.881
a body clearly isn't strong
enough to destroy Zak Saturday.

12:46.883 --> 12:50.819
<i>Dr. Animo: [tsking]
Really, Mr. Argost.</i>

12:50.821 --> 12:53.822
Men of our caliber needn't
fight our own battles.

12:53.824 --> 12:58.426
It's beneath us.
Voilá!

13:03.206 --> 13:07.402
And these are but the first.
Together, we can locate enough

13:07.404 --> 13:10.371
creatures to build an
army of Franken-Cryptids!

13:10.373 --> 13:12.874
V.V. Argost: But
Cryptids are unpredictable.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.009
How do you know they won't turn on you?

13:15.011 --> 13:19.881
Dr. Animo: Sadly, I've had to
resort to rather crude methods.

13:19.883 --> 13:23.351
This only works with the
simplest of creatures such as

13:23.353 --> 13:26.855
these Chupacabras.
All Tennyson has to do to beat

13:26.857 --> 13:30.625
me is destroy this
transmogrifier, but you,

13:30.627 --> 13:36.297
Mr. Argost, thanks to the
residual powers of the anti-kur,

13:36.299 --> 13:41.769
you can control them with but a thought.

13:46.452 --> 13:48.522
[laughs evilly]

13:48.660 --> 13:52.140
Prepare for battle!

14:00.538 --> 14:04.634
That's it!
[tires screech]

14:06.496 --> 14:09.801
There's definitely a Cryptid in there.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.636
Rook: I can use my proto
tool to realign the tumblers.

14:14.638 --> 14:18.673
Oh, wait...
[engine revving]

14:18.675 --> 14:21.327
...they left the door unlocked.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.980
<i>Ben: Welcome to Animo's lab,</i>

14:25.982 --> 14:29.784
population zero.
Looks like he took off.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.854
Argost's handwriting. Looks
like he figured out how to

14:32.856 --> 14:35.040
bring himself back using the
combined life force

14:35.073 --> 14:38.593
of Cryptids and aliens.
- Rook: But you said Argost was

14:38.595 --> 14:42.232
completely annihilated in a mystical
particle/anti-particle reaction.

14:42.267 --> 14:45.567
Maybe the reaction created
its own interference pattern,

14:45.568 --> 14:48.804
sending reverse wave forms back
through the original conduance.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.229
Rook: Which would
account for your restored

14:50.333 --> 14:53.512
telepathic powers, as well
as Argost's resurrection

14:53.535 --> 14:56.344
via this device.
- Ben: Don't worry, big guy ...

14:56.346 --> 14:59.131
I'm not getting any of this either.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.002
[mumbling]

15:04.003 --> 15:06.521
[gasps]
Brilliant, Fisk!

15:06.523 --> 15:10.692
If we reverse the field
polarity, it just might work!

15:10.694 --> 15:15.863
[sloop!]
Guys, if they're gone, why am I

15:15.865 --> 15:18.333
still sensing a Cryptid in here?

15:21.957 --> 15:27.014
[creature roars]

16:12.255 --> 16:14.789
If you were Argost, where would you be?

16:14.791 --> 16:16.559
[beeping]

16:17.089 --> 16:19.986
Attacking the airship.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.065
<i>V.V. Argost: Don't look now.
The Saturdays will go</i>

16:24.067 --> 16:27.595
<i> down in flames!
[creatures shrieking]</i>

16:29.873 --> 16:32.540
[tires screech]
We have to get up there to

16:32.542 --> 16:34.609
help Mom and Dad!
- No, you don't.

16:34.611 --> 16:37.812
We evacuated everyone before
Argost made it to the ship.

16:37.814 --> 16:40.481
Ben: I'm so glad you're
okay, Mrs. Saturday.

16:40.483 --> 16:45.969
Um, my Dad's okay, too.
- V.V. Argost: Morphs, forget

16:46.013 --> 16:51.358
the ship ... attack!
- Let's do this again!

16:54.664 --> 16:56.631
[grunts]

16:56.633 --> 16:58.267
[creature shrieks]

17:03.948 --> 17:06.307
Put him down, you hideous beast!

17:06.309 --> 17:11.998
V.V. Argost: My dear, do we
really have to resort to name calling?

17:16.118 --> 17:20.154
[electricity crackling]
Agh!

17:20.156 --> 17:21.145
<i>Aah!</i>

<i>V.V. Argost: Bonjour,
Doc and Drew Saturday.</i>

17:53.007 --> 17:57.922
What a coincidence running into
you in this sleepy, little burgh.

18:01.746 --> 18:02.946
[car alarm blaring]

18:05.352 --> 18:07.285
Shocksquatch: [shouts ]
[blaring continues]

18:07.287 --> 18:10.388
This is between us!
Leave them alone!

18:10.390 --> 18:14.009
V.V. Argost: Very well.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.629
[Chupacabras chittering]

18:17.631 --> 18:20.671
[fingers snap]
[Chupacabras shrieking]

18:21.168 --> 18:23.902
Ah, the world's only Fiskerton phantom.

18:23.904 --> 18:27.872
If I could cross you with an
owl man, it would be the bee's

18:27.874 --> 18:31.209
knees. Note to self ...
put knees on bees.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.879
Let's take him back to my lab!

18:34.881 --> 18:38.149

Huh?

18:38.151 --> 18:40.752

18:57.669 --> 19:01.105
Unh!
- V.V. Argost: Any last words?

19:01.107 --> 19:03.842
You won't win!
You look gross!

19:03.844 --> 19:09.089
In the last season of your
show, you totally phoned it in!

19:10.283 --> 19:15.086
V.V. Argost: [shrieks]
[beeping]

19:15.088 --> 19:17.755
Argost's body runs on the
life force that was in the

19:17.757 --> 19:20.959
Chupacabras' cannisters. If
we can syphon the energy back

19:20.961 --> 19:24.095
out of them, it'll shut him
down and free the Cryptids.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.432
Ben: So you need an alien
who can channel energy?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.901
I think I know just the guy.

19:34.571 --> 19:36.941
V.V. Argost: Oh, can't this wait?

19:36.943 --> 19:40.111
I'm about to finish off
Zak Saturday ... kind of my

19:40.113 --> 19:43.114
raison d'etre.
- Dr. Animo: Sorry, that

19:43.116 --> 19:46.651
Fiskerton thing is proving
very hard to capture.

19:46.653 --> 19:49.787
[grunts] Agh!
- V.V. Argost: Did I stutter?!

19:49.789 --> 19:52.790
I said not now!
- Dr. Animo: After all I've

19:52.792 --> 19:55.960
done for you!
I'm the scientific genius here!

19:55.962 --> 19:59.430
V.V. Argost: Oh, please.
You can be replaced by

21:12.968 --> 21:15.155
Ready for that limelight?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.826
Thanks, Ben. Much as I'd
like the world to

21:17.828 --> 21:20.495
know what I do, our
work has to stay secret.

21:20.497 --> 21:23.765
Animo's not the only one
who wants to hurt Cryptids.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.434
I'd rather keep them safe
than be a star.

21:26.436 --> 21:29.637
Ben: Well, it's been great
saving the world with you.

21:29.639 --> 21:31.740
You too.
- Ben: And your Mom.

21:31.742 --> 21:36.144
Still my Mom, dude!
Oh, one last thing.

21:36.146 --> 21:38.646
Picture with you as an alien?
- Ben: You bet.

21:38.648 --> 21:41.750
Rook: I do not understand
human fascination with

21:41.752 --> 21:45.287
Ben's aliens. I am an
alien after all as are all

of the aliens in Undertown.
In fact, to us, Earth is

21:48.825 --> 21:51.025
an alien planet.
- Ben: Relax, Rook.

You're still my number-one partner.
