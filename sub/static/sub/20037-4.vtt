WEBVTT

00:01.047 --> 00:04.366
Tomorrow we re-open in Greek Street.

00:04.367 --> 00:05.606
Culls might not come.

00:05.607 --> 00:07.486
You're a scorpion, Mrs. Scanwell,

00:07.487 --> 00:09.686
and I've asked you to
sting Margaret Wells.

00:09.687 --> 00:12.246
The deed grants you your own liberty.

00:12.247 --> 00:14.246
It doesn't extend to the children.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.686
If they're slaves,
you will buy them back.

00:16.687 --> 00:18.006
I can never be a whore.

00:18.007 --> 00:20.206
And who is Mr. Osborne?

00:20.207 --> 00:22.126
He's the short straw.

00:22.127 --> 00:24.006
I don't want a life
like Kitty and Fanny.

00:24.007 --> 00:25.806
I don't think she likes me.

01:11.807 --> 01:14.366
There is torment waiting,

01:14.367 --> 01:17.446
in this world and the next,

01:17.447 --> 01:20.526
for those of you who seek base relief

01:20.527 --> 01:23.806
in the house of Margaret Wells.

01:23.807 --> 01:27.306
In the sweat of fornication,

01:27.807 --> 01:30.326
you will thrust away your soul.

01:32.247 --> 01:35.366
For in your heaving and grunting

01:35.367 --> 01:38.166
you diminish your God-like form

01:38.167 --> 01:40.726
into that of a lumpen beast.

01:40.727 --> 01:44.246
If you release the seed of your loins

01:44.247 --> 01:46.446
into her clawing Jades,

01:47.195 --> 01:49.915
- disease will latch onto you...
- Did I please you, sir?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.115
- ... and suck.
- You are...

01:52.140 --> 01:53.686
lovelier than June.

01:53.687 --> 01:56.446
God can see all your filthy desires.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.806
He knows your lechery.

01:58.807 --> 02:01.886
- Every lascivious thought...
- Mr. Lynch.

02:01.887 --> 02:03.886
... every lewd and...

02:03.887 --> 02:06.366
- ... bestial act of carnality...
- How did you find her?

02:06.367 --> 02:10.126
A sweet and accomplished girl.

02:10.127 --> 02:12.366
As her keeper, you could mold her

02:12.367 --> 02:14.846
into the girl of your dreams.

02:14.847 --> 02:17.366
She was... a little distant.

02:17.367 --> 02:19.966
Passing shyness, nothing more.

02:19.967 --> 02:22.246
She withdrew when I touched her.

02:22.247 --> 02:23.846
My apologies, Mrs. Wells.

02:23.847 --> 02:25.846
I fear your daughter is not for me.

02:25.847 --> 02:29.686
... these girls are grinning succubi

02:29.687 --> 02:31.246
in rotting ribbons,

02:31.247 --> 02:34.206
a poisonous slurry between their legs.

02:34.207 --> 02:35.806
How does she do it?

02:35.807 --> 02:37.526
Where does she get her supply of words?

02:37.527 --> 02:40.086
They pick away at your
merits as though they're...

02:40.087 --> 02:42.046
They're born out of pain...

02:42.047 --> 02:43.966
from sewing her own cunny up.

02:43.967 --> 02:46.806
... is the she-witch, Margaret Wells.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.527
Is he to be my keeper?

03:08.527 --> 03:11.566
He was very keen to have you, but...

03:11.567 --> 03:13.926
when I questioned him
further about his finances,

03:13.927 --> 03:15.926
he fell far short.

03:16.046 --> 03:17.926
Sorry.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.967
We'll find you another, better keeper.

03:28.047 --> 03:30.296
Lady Caroline is barren.

03:30.807 --> 03:32.486
Is she?

03:32.487 --> 03:33.829
Poor girl.

03:34.367 --> 03:37.329
Don't pity her, it's her own fault.

03:37.687 --> 03:40.526
The serpent feels no
inclination to perform for her.

03:40.527 --> 03:43.246
She must not worship it as I do.

03:43.247 --> 03:46.639
It is such a fine, beautiful beast.

03:48.047 --> 03:50.846
I'd like you to have my heir.

03:50.847 --> 03:53.164
- Would you?
- Mmm.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.566
You could bear it and
then we could send Caroline

03:55.567 --> 03:58.617
off into the country
and pretend it was hers.

03:59.127 --> 04:01.966
I wonder what Lady Caroline
would think to that.

04:01.967 --> 04:03.581
Who cares?

04:12.207 --> 04:13.501
Get out.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.846
I need to wash.

04:15.847 --> 04:17.995
This is your own doing, you know.

04:20.047 --> 04:22.167
Do you think I did this to myself?

04:28.607 --> 04:31.046
You get these disagreeable
experiences because you cannot...

04:31.047 --> 04:32.866
Disagreeable?

04:33.367 --> 04:36.406
Stop pretending you're still a lady.

04:36.407 --> 04:37.606
That went up your arse

04:37.607 --> 04:39.926
with the prick of that
rake you ran away with.

04:39.927 --> 04:43.046
No more county balls
for poor Miss Pettifer.

04:43.047 --> 04:44.926
Only hairy ones now.

04:44.927 --> 04:47.167
I hope he strangles you next time.

04:56.967 --> 04:58.984
I used to get Osborne.

04:59.927 --> 05:01.691
Then you came.

05:02.407 --> 05:04.927
Now no one notices me so much.

05:10.087 --> 05:12.246
Don't you dare be nice to me.

05:12.247 --> 05:14.086
Don't worry.

05:14.087 --> 05:15.607
I'm a bitch.

05:34.487 --> 05:36.606
and the Arch-Bawd of London.

05:36.607 --> 05:39.366
Your lust will confound you.

05:39.367 --> 05:41.846
It will cost you your soul!

05:41.847 --> 05:44.686
The blackamoor pimp.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.966
My agreement with your
father was a verbal one.

05:56.967 --> 05:59.166
He didn't specify a date for repayment.

05:59.167 --> 06:01.366
But your house is clearly failing,

06:01.367 --> 06:04.406
so I wish to withdraw my investment.

06:06.087 --> 06:07.806
I ain't got it.

06:07.807 --> 06:10.606
Your father knew it would take time.

06:10.607 --> 06:12.406
But I can offer you...

06:12.431 --> 06:15.376
the oldest payments known to man:

06:16.847 --> 06:18.726
payment in kind.

06:18.727 --> 06:19.806
I've seen your girls.

06:19.807 --> 06:21.580
They're not worth ten shillings.

06:23.287 --> 06:25.827
I don't take kindly to that.

06:26.847 --> 06:29.904
If you cannot see my worth,

06:30.367 --> 06:31.905
clearly...

06:33.287 --> 06:35.555
you have not come close enough.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.966
Turn over and lie still.

06:52.527 --> 06:55.726
Harriett, may I have
clean water in my jug?

07:01.047 --> 07:03.406
Why does nobody want her?

07:03.407 --> 07:05.166
Mr. Lynch said that she withdrew

07:05.167 --> 07:07.236
when he went to touch her.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.046
We were counting on that money.

07:09.047 --> 07:10.246
If he'd have taken her,

07:10.247 --> 07:11.606
it'd have paid off half our debts.

07:11.607 --> 07:14.286
Now Lennox wants his loan
and we can't pay it back.

07:14.287 --> 07:15.926
Three days, Will.

07:15.927 --> 07:17.486
Three days and the rent is due,

07:17.487 --> 07:19.046
and I haven't got it.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.926
Business will pick up.

07:20.927 --> 07:23.308
We've still got our regulars.

07:26.247 --> 07:28.440
I'm going to see Charlotte.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.846
You all right?

07:31.847 --> 07:33.046
Of course.

07:33.047 --> 07:34.526
Don't fret.

07:34.527 --> 07:37.526
That day is soon upon us, my brothers,

07:37.527 --> 07:38.846
when London...

07:41.287 --> 07:43.768
That's the youngest daughter.

07:44.247 --> 07:48.046
Margaret Wells has
debauched her own child!

07:48.047 --> 07:51.246
That girl is cursed
to have such a mother!

07:51.247 --> 07:52.846
What about your poor child?

07:52.847 --> 07:55.806
Margaret Wells, you are
treacherous to the innocent.

07:55.807 --> 07:57.046
You fake.

07:57.047 --> 07:59.607
You're paid by Dame
Death to destroy my trade!

08:02.847 --> 08:04.966
Rest, Mother, rest.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.286
It was a picture.

08:10.287 --> 08:11.486
Mrs. Wells cursing

08:11.487 --> 08:13.166
and Mrs. Scanwell crying "Demon!"

08:14.807 --> 08:17.486
How deliciously vulgar!

08:17.487 --> 08:20.726
I swear she'll flounder
before the week is out.

08:27.607 --> 08:31.686
The Spartans are preparing
for their sacred games.

08:31.687 --> 08:35.126
They would like a sacrifice
to augur their success.

08:35.126 --> 08:36.686
Oh, spit it out.

08:36.687 --> 08:38.566
You want to spoil another virgin.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.126
Allow me my metaphors.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.525
Do they make your
enterprise any less vile?

08:43.527 --> 08:45.646
The terms will be the same.

08:45.647 --> 08:47.166
No.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.766
Your Spartans all have names.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.566
I want one, that's my price.

08:50.567 --> 08:53.046
I have sworn an oath of secrecy.

08:53.047 --> 08:56.546
A pox on your oath, my neck is at stake!

08:57.047 --> 08:58.766
Knowledge is security.

08:58.767 --> 09:01.234
One girl, one name.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.006
This house and its vile harlots...

09:06.007 --> 09:07.646
is an abomination.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.926
Have you no culls with you, Mr. North?

09:09.927 --> 09:11.686
I've got no standing around here.

09:11.687 --> 09:13.648
Margaret Wells!

09:15.007 --> 09:17.806
Margaret Wells is an enemy of God!

09:17.807 --> 09:19.646
Does that woman never rest?

09:23.728 --> 09:25.406
Good mornin'.

09:30.167 --> 09:32.326
Why don't you knock on the door?

09:32.327 --> 09:34.326
We could do it in a bed for once.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.806
Do you want it up an alley,

09:40.807 --> 09:42.926
in the dirt and the grease?

10:03.047 --> 10:05.588
What if you can't think of what to say?

10:05.807 --> 10:07.686
Or it comes out wrong?

10:07.687 --> 10:09.446
Then you just nod and smile

10:09.447 --> 10:11.446
and move 'em on to the easy bit.

10:11.447 --> 10:13.206
So you find it easy?

10:13.207 --> 10:16.295
If it's giving you no
pleasure, manage things,

10:16.567 --> 10:18.526
to bring them on.

10:18.527 --> 10:20.409
You can be bold.

10:21.327 --> 10:23.447
By grasping the nettle?

10:23.767 --> 10:25.154
Yes.

10:25.527 --> 10:27.767
It's an easy beast to tame.

10:30.807 --> 10:32.127
Here.

10:37.327 --> 10:40.084
Make yourself its mistress.

10:44.807 --> 10:48.166
Take a firm hold and set the pace.

10:48.167 --> 10:49.809
Like on a horse.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.406
Start with a trot...

10:52.767 --> 10:55.166
and build to a gallop.

10:55.167 --> 10:58.286
And the more aroused they believe you,

10:58.287 --> 11:00.806
the sooner the cannon
will fire its balls.

11:04.167 --> 11:07.646
I could bestride the
world with such a serpent!

11:07.647 --> 11:09.015
Oh!

11:09.567 --> 11:12.046
There's no easier chimp to master

11:12.047 --> 11:16.126
than a man in a bed with
a stiff little pintle.

11:18.207 --> 11:20.006
Sir George.

11:20.007 --> 11:21.493
Howard!

11:22.527 --> 11:26.046
Satan built a palace in the fiery pit...

11:26.047 --> 11:29.526
The thing that sets us apart
is the warmth of our welcome.

11:29.527 --> 11:31.206
It's different here.

11:31.207 --> 11:32.646
The culls we need, they don't want

11:32.647 --> 11:34.806
common girls singing bawdy songs.

11:34.807 --> 11:37.166
They want a good time, we
know how to give it to 'em.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.166
... in foul and flagrant
defiance of God's law,

11:40.167 --> 11:43.526
like Satan's Palace is pandemonium!

11:43.527 --> 11:46.006
She says our house is Satan's Palace.

11:50.407 --> 11:52.717
Then why don't we show her...

11:52.742 --> 11:54.406
how we dance?

11:54.407 --> 11:56.884
Margaret Wells!

12:22.647 --> 12:24.126
Keep scrubbin'!

12:30.687 --> 12:32.406
Inside now!

12:38.127 --> 12:40.046
A masquerade.

12:40.047 --> 12:42.286
You should charge the highest price,

12:42.287 --> 12:43.526
and have a password,

12:43.527 --> 12:45.843
so only those who have it can get in.

12:46.407 --> 12:48.166
Pandemonium.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.446
I adore it.

12:50.647 --> 12:53.166
Oh, I'll invite some
sparkling cheap sorts,

12:53.167 --> 12:54.926
add some spice.

12:54.927 --> 12:57.406
I could even snag Lord Fallon.

12:57.407 --> 13:00.408
He's an icy fish but the
whole world follows him.

13:01.407 --> 13:03.646
She's done you a favor,

13:03.647 --> 13:05.126
that preacher.

13:05.127 --> 13:06.646
How?

13:06.647 --> 13:08.676
She's made you notorious.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.806
You're the bad bawd of London, Ma.

13:11.807 --> 13:14.871
When I've striven so hard to be so good.

13:15.287 --> 13:17.886
I'll do your pimping at
The Cocoa Tree tonight.

13:17.887 --> 13:19.818
Take Lucy with you.

13:20.018 --> 13:22.047
See if you can help her.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.806
As an instrument of the law,

13:25.807 --> 13:28.286
you must be spotless and above reproach.

13:28.287 --> 13:30.166
Yes, sir, absolutely.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.046
When a man knows your vice,

13:32.047 --> 13:33.926
he can use you, can't he?

13:33.927 --> 13:37.324
And in your position,
that's a dangerous thing.

13:37.927 --> 13:39.806
Yes, yes, sir.

13:39.807 --> 13:42.046
Take this to Quigley's in Golden Square

13:42.047 --> 13:44.006
and wait for a reply.

13:44.007 --> 13:47.286
That's a... brothel, sir.

13:49.007 --> 13:50.566
I like you, Oswald.

13:50.567 --> 13:52.046
You're efficient.

13:52.047 --> 13:53.406
I'd hate to lose you

13:53.407 --> 13:55.787
for the sake of your filthy fuck.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.495
What's this for?

14:15.927 --> 14:17.952
Your betterment.

14:18.287 --> 14:20.406
I can't see you anymore.

14:20.431 --> 14:21.806
I'm sorry.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.870
Margaret Wells' mother...

14:26.895 --> 14:31.167
let the evil one spill
his seed into her womb.

14:33.447 --> 14:36.286
I'm sorry if I've appeared disapproving.

14:36.287 --> 14:38.006
Well, we are mucky whores.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.926
Being used by all those men.

14:39.927 --> 14:41.163
Being paid.

14:42.207 --> 14:45.275
Money I earn takes care of my daughter.

14:45.527 --> 14:46.926
Where is she?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.406
With my sister.

14:48.407 --> 14:50.406
... walking upon the earth.

15:04.527 --> 15:06.047
For you.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.686
You've stood by all this time

15:17.687 --> 15:20.006
while your mumma torments me,

15:20.007 --> 15:23.166
and you think I'll thank
you for your sugar pigs!

15:23.167 --> 15:25.766
You fat, useless, grinning baby.

15:25.767 --> 15:28.103
Have a care, Emily.

15:28.687 --> 15:30.926
I care to see you clinging
to your mumma's teats

15:30.927 --> 15:32.566
when you could be a man!

15:32.567 --> 15:34.989
How much does Mr. Osborne pay?

15:46.119 --> 15:48.063
From Justice Cunliffe.

15:48.838 --> 15:51.825
- Mumma.
- Knock before you come in.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.526
Emily Lacey is not to
have Mr. Osborne anymore.

15:54.527 --> 15:56.321
Go out and knock!

15:56.346 --> 15:57.446
Did you hear what I said?

15:57.447 --> 15:59.143
I won't allow it.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.935
Very well.

16:04.327 --> 16:06.886
When Mr. Osborne arrives,

16:06.911 --> 16:09.065
you tell him so.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.406
But keep him happy,

16:11.407 --> 16:14.046
even if you have to
service him yourself.

16:16.647 --> 16:19.374
He won't dare say a word, ha.

16:30.127 --> 16:32.806
That's Howard's friend,
Sir Christopher Rutledge.

16:32.807 --> 16:35.046
Everyone calls him Crispy.

16:35.047 --> 16:36.126
Why?

16:36.127 --> 16:37.926
Public school indiscretion,

16:37.927 --> 16:40.526
which he failed to
wipe from his breeches.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.206
Miss Wells,

16:44.207 --> 16:45.766
as dazzling as ever.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.926
May I present my sister, Lucy?

16:47.927 --> 16:49.766
She's new to society,

16:49.767 --> 16:52.446
so don't startle her with
any acts of depravity.

16:52.447 --> 16:54.406
You have my word as a gentleman.

16:54.407 --> 16:56.806
It's not your word she must be wary of.

17:02.167 --> 17:04.646
There's our prize, Lord Fallon.

17:04.646 --> 17:06.766
If we get him, we get 'em all.

17:09.247 --> 17:11.989
I want the skinny blonde!

17:12.847 --> 17:14.846
But Miss Pettifer is blonde.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.886
I'll have the skinny one or none at all.

17:20.847 --> 17:22.650
Then none at all.

17:23.406 --> 17:25.965
I have spent thousands here, Quigley!

17:25.967 --> 17:28.606
And I pay to do as I like!

17:28.607 --> 17:30.406
If I go, I won't be back,

17:30.407 --> 17:33.886
and I will blacken your name
from Westminster to Wapping.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.696
Mr. Osborne.

17:38.721 --> 17:40.846
Has there been some misunderstanding?

17:40.847 --> 17:42.246
No, Madam.

17:42.247 --> 17:44.646
I've been extremely clear.

17:53.127 --> 17:55.406
Your job is to get trade for this house,

17:55.407 --> 17:57.208
not to lose it!

17:57.941 --> 18:00.406
You're unfit for purpose.

18:04.407 --> 18:06.206
Any more bets please; don't be shy now.

18:06.207 --> 18:09.206
I've been to a thousand
such tedious masquerades.

18:09.207 --> 18:11.126
This time you'll find your every desire

18:11.127 --> 18:12.885
is well met, my lord.

18:13.265 --> 18:16.926
I have only one desire, Miss Wells.

18:16.927 --> 18:19.686
And when you exchange
your boy for a man,

18:19.687 --> 18:20.686
I hope to indulge in it.

18:20.687 --> 18:22.606
Sir Christopher, you know my heart

18:22.607 --> 18:24.326
has only one familiar.

18:24.327 --> 18:27.926
Your love is as boundless
as a leaking jug.

18:27.927 --> 18:30.646
I'm moved by your tender affections.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.639
All on rouge.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.886
What say you, Fallon?

18:35.887 --> 18:37.646
I like my pleasures guaranteed.

18:37.647 --> 18:39.886
I prefer mine stolen and illicit.

18:39.887 --> 18:41.846
Quit before you go too far.

18:45.659 --> 18:46.754
Rouge again.

18:46.779 --> 18:49.342
My mother would count it a special honor

18:49.367 --> 18:50.846
if you'd attend, my lord.

18:50.847 --> 18:52.846
Since when did I give a
damn about your mother?

18:52.847 --> 18:55.566
My mother is the Arch-Bawd of London.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.886
Did you not know?

18:56.887 --> 18:58.148
So we're all to wear masks

18:58.158 --> 18:59.717
and pretend we're in Hades?

19:00.718 --> 19:03.292
Not all of us have to pretend.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.525
I must decline your thrilling offer.

19:06.550 --> 19:07.967
You disappoint me.

19:07.992 --> 19:10.511
I'd heard Lord Fallon
was a man of discernment.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.511
To Hades,

19:14.512 --> 19:16.991
and all who dare to travel there.

19:45.712 --> 19:47.528
He's gone.

19:48.832 --> 19:50.743
Never to return.

19:52.565 --> 19:54.506
I vanquished him.

19:55.047 --> 19:56.379
For you.

20:09.473 --> 20:12.112
You look as if you've met with luck.

20:12.567 --> 20:15.021
I met with an amorous lady of means.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.286
My mother's giving a party.

20:18.287 --> 20:19.671
Will you come?

20:20.407 --> 20:21.519
Yes.

20:22.927 --> 20:24.766
You must wear a mask.

20:24.767 --> 20:26.046
I will.

20:26.047 --> 20:27.726
You must take yours off.

20:29.047 --> 20:30.420
I will.

20:31.207 --> 20:32.486
It's time for you to leave.

20:32.487 --> 20:34.286
Sir George, may I present Mr. D...

20:34.287 --> 20:35.486
Leave.

20:35.487 --> 20:36.766
I haven't finished playing.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.486
Well, I'm ordering
you back to the house.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.726
- You're making yourself foolish.
- No, you have done that.

20:43.487 --> 20:44.806
Go back to the house

20:44.807 --> 20:46.766
or I'll take you there myself.

21:02.647 --> 21:04.919
My sister's still inside.

21:05.407 --> 21:07.246
But you cannot go back in.

21:10.287 --> 21:12.286
I misplayed my hand.

21:12.287 --> 21:13.966
I let the mask slip for a moment

21:13.967 --> 21:16.425
and he saw me laugh at him.

21:19.967 --> 21:21.446
- Over here.
- Sir.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.326
I'll see your sister safely home.

21:25.567 --> 21:27.089
Thank you.

21:33.687 --> 21:35.446
But be wary.

21:35.447 --> 21:38.064
There are snares all
around for us harlots.

22:14.647 --> 22:16.206
Haxby!

22:22.007 --> 22:24.006
Where's your master?

22:24.007 --> 22:26.480
He has not yet come home.

22:26.927 --> 22:29.526
Perhaps he sought
more congenial company.

22:29.527 --> 22:31.246
Oh, dear.

22:31.247 --> 22:32.686
Spurned for another.

22:32.687 --> 22:34.676
How will I ease my poor heart?

22:35.207 --> 22:38.621
I didn't know you had
such an organ in your body.

22:39.527 --> 22:42.246
I swear you're missing
an organ, too, Haxby.

22:54.287 --> 22:56.046
Mother.

22:56.047 --> 22:57.686
Mrs. Quigley is here.

22:57.687 --> 22:59.486
- Mrs. Quigley?
- No, no, no,

22:59.487 --> 23:01.766
do not trouble yourself,
dear Mrs. Scanwell.

23:01.767 --> 23:04.246
Amelia tells me you are unwell.

23:04.247 --> 23:05.639
Here, child.

23:06.047 --> 23:09.086
Run to the apothecary
for a soothing draft.

23:21.927 --> 23:23.846
I trust you will be recovered enough

23:23.847 --> 23:25.650
to preach tonight.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.646
Margaret Wells' wickedness

23:28.647 --> 23:31.847
cannot be allowed to proceed unchecked.

23:32.247 --> 23:35.857
I will do your bidding
no longer, Mrs. Quigley.

23:36.527 --> 23:38.766
My daughter and I will
seek new accommodations

23:38.767 --> 23:40.447
as soon as I am able.

23:42.287 --> 23:45.322
I have a story I would share with you.

23:46.767 --> 23:50.302
The tale of a shameless whore,

23:50.327 --> 23:52.806
whom I once saw cavorting with her cull

23:52.807 --> 23:54.619
in plain sight.

23:55.287 --> 23:57.646
It was such a lascivious display

23:57.647 --> 24:00.619
from a young woman without fear...

24:00.644 --> 24:02.927
or decency.

24:03.351 --> 24:07.006
I've watched her progress
with interest ever since.

24:12.327 --> 24:15.046
What was your name in those days?

24:17.527 --> 24:19.686
Does your congregation know?

24:21.527 --> 24:23.246
Or your daughter?

24:27.327 --> 24:30.046
Enjoy your preaching, Mrs. Scanwell.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.246
- There you are.
- Thank you.

24:42.247 --> 24:43.446
Good day.

25:19.247 --> 25:20.526
Oh, no!

25:20.527 --> 25:21.692
No!

25:23.207 --> 25:24.926
After everything that I've done for you?

25:24.927 --> 25:26.686
Please, please, please,
Charlie, just let me go.

25:26.687 --> 25:28.646
How could you think of
running away from me?

25:28.647 --> 25:31.205
I can't stay here, it's torment!

25:31.487 --> 25:33.486
But I'm looking after you.

25:36.767 --> 25:38.808
It isn't right that she
treats me like a little boy.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.028
I'm a man.

25:40.447 --> 25:42.687
It's time she saw that.

25:52.007 --> 25:53.766
You saw me steal.

25:53.767 --> 25:55.447
Why didn't you call the watch?

25:56.908 --> 25:59.615
It was not for me to judge.

26:01.007 --> 26:03.110
Bloody purse was empty anyway.

26:04.567 --> 26:06.405
You got any money?

26:08.503 --> 26:10.263
Come on then.

26:20.687 --> 26:22.006
Take a flower?

26:22.007 --> 26:23.646
Fresh cut this morning.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.926
Penny for a posy, my lady?

26:31.927 --> 26:33.246
Hmm.

26:35.247 --> 26:38.440
Tell me, child, have you no family?

26:39.727 --> 26:41.006
Oh.

26:46.527 --> 26:49.373
I'll be trained to be a lady's maid?

26:49.847 --> 26:51.537
You will.

26:52.007 --> 26:53.206
The house is owned

26:53.207 --> 26:56.766
by a most charitable
Christian gentleman.

26:56.767 --> 27:00.382
We've placed half a dozen
girls in good households.

27:00.807 --> 27:03.246
I can hardly believe it.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.158
What did I do to deserve
such good fortune?

27:08.807 --> 27:11.585
Thank you, madam.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.766
Do I detect a small voice of conscience

27:29.767 --> 27:31.727
whispering in your ear?

27:36.487 --> 27:38.926
You going to try and save my soul?

27:41.767 --> 27:44.554
This is such a sinful world.

27:45.407 --> 27:48.134
Perhaps you're the one who needs saving.

27:48.567 --> 27:52.567
Vi, Nancy says we're to
meet her at Mrs. Wells'.

27:56.487 --> 27:57.806
You're leaving?

27:57.807 --> 28:00.381
The wages of sin don't earn themselves.

28:00.406 --> 28:02.325
Is she coming to Hades, too?

28:02.327 --> 28:05.006
Plenty of souls to save there.

28:05.007 --> 28:07.406
You want to see my world,
Scanwell's daughter?

28:26.247 --> 28:28.013
Have I tied it right?

28:28.038 --> 28:29.526
You're perfect, honey.

28:29.527 --> 28:31.166
We should earn some coin tonight.

28:31.167 --> 28:34.326
You do well, there'll be a place
here for you, Betsey Fletcher.

28:38.447 --> 28:40.286
Why don't I get a mask?

28:40.287 --> 28:42.006
Not you.

28:42.007 --> 28:44.086
It's different with you.

28:44.087 --> 28:45.743
You must be seen.

28:46.327 --> 28:47.846
You know that.

29:00.807 --> 29:03.511
Who is this handsome stranger?

29:03.536 --> 29:06.488
I feel strangely drawn to him.

29:06.847 --> 29:09.007
As you are to all handsome strangers.

29:14.647 --> 29:18.005
I'd pour gold into your lap
if I was sure of your love.

29:18.030 --> 29:20.316
You have it.

29:20.796 --> 29:22.327
I love you.

29:25.573 --> 29:28.053
I told you not to lie.

29:35.247 --> 29:38.086
So, you are the ferryman
who must be paid.

29:38.087 --> 29:39.766
No, Nancy.

29:39.767 --> 29:41.406
I am Hades,

29:41.407 --> 29:43.486
king of the underworld.

29:43.487 --> 29:45.046
And here's my queen.

29:46.767 --> 29:48.766
Tonight will be what we make it.

29:48.767 --> 29:51.246
Well, what you make it.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.006
'Cause you're Margaret
Wells, queen of bloody Soho.

30:11.487 --> 30:13.866
I was told there was a party.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.806
Take any girl you want.

30:16.807 --> 30:19.094
They're on the house!

30:19.119 --> 30:20.325
Take your pick.

30:20.327 --> 30:22.246
This way, you curs!

30:24.047 --> 30:25.766
Margaret Wells

30:25.767 --> 30:28.446
openly taunts God!

30:28.447 --> 30:33.046
Her house sits like a crusting scab

30:33.047 --> 30:35.686
over the suppurating boil of Hell.

30:35.687 --> 30:37.806
Thank you, Mrs. Scanwell.

30:37.807 --> 30:40.514
Thank you for showing
those sinners where to come.

30:41.767 --> 30:43.526
Welcome!

30:43.527 --> 30:45.938
Welcome, one and all.

30:45.963 --> 30:48.005
Welcome to my fiery hole.

30:50.007 --> 30:52.246
- Sinners all.
- Pandemonium.

30:52.247 --> 30:55.041
You test God's patience tonight.

30:55.066 --> 30:58.365
Hush, you'll be like
thoroughbreds amongst donkeys.

30:59.327 --> 31:00.486
Hurry.

31:00.487 --> 31:02.006
Where are you going?

31:02.007 --> 31:04.046
To the masquerade at Margaret Wells'.

31:04.047 --> 31:06.246
I shall take our girls
and steal her trade.

31:06.247 --> 31:08.486
That'll show Mother that
my judgment can be trusted.

31:08.487 --> 31:10.750
- Oh, take me with you.
- No.

31:11.287 --> 31:13.480
She's taken my allowance, Emily.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.593
You are a donkey.

31:17.687 --> 31:19.006
Marie-Louise, take a message

31:19.007 --> 31:20.646
to Mrs. Wells for me, I beg you.

31:20.647 --> 31:21.926
Tell her I want to come back,

31:21.927 --> 31:23.312
and tell her I'll do anything.

31:23.353 --> 31:24.508
_

31:24.533 --> 31:26.779
La Quigley, she will kill me.

31:31.087 --> 31:33.766
And there will be no respite

31:33.767 --> 31:36.046
and no succor...

31:36.047 --> 31:38.399
Are you moved to repent, sister?

31:38.424 --> 31:41.183
I'm not your sister, Ratface.

31:41.208 --> 31:43.246
Who are you to insult me?

31:43.247 --> 31:45.566
I earn my coins the same way as you.

31:45.567 --> 31:47.566
I don't earn mine spying for Dame Death.

31:47.567 --> 31:49.560
I do what I must to survive.

31:50.487 --> 31:52.291
Then do this.

31:53.007 --> 31:55.246
... to a foul reek.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.813
When the harlot in your
arms removes her mask,

31:59.807 --> 32:02.806
a grinning death's head
is all that you will see.

32:02.807 --> 32:04.246
Madam.

32:04.247 --> 32:07.128
I am the curate from St. Clement Danes.

32:07.153 --> 32:09.245
Hearing of your indisposition,

32:09.247 --> 32:12.246
I've come to preach in your stead.

32:12.247 --> 32:13.753
Who sent you?

32:14.207 --> 32:15.686
A friend.

32:18.847 --> 32:22.948
Mother, we must pray for
the kindness of that friend.

32:22.973 --> 32:24.332
Come.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.486
And the skulls will have eyes

32:31.487 --> 32:33.859
and the eyes will have jewels.

32:33.884 --> 32:36.765
And there will be feasting in hell

32:36.767 --> 32:39.286
with roasted swans and pigs' heads

32:39.287 --> 32:42.166
with apples dipped in virgin's blood,

32:42.167 --> 32:45.766
and sinners will lick nectar
from each other's stomachs,

32:45.767 --> 32:48.926
and those of firm and manly impulse...

32:48.927 --> 32:50.206
Welcome.

32:53.007 --> 32:54.766
Welcome.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.486
That's Lord Fallon.

32:59.487 --> 33:00.926
Told you I'd get him.

33:00.927 --> 33:02.781
I never doubted.

33:03.407 --> 33:05.766
Welcome to my midnight realm.

33:09.727 --> 33:11.486
Our visit won't be long.

33:11.487 --> 33:13.006
Pandemonium!

33:16.167 --> 33:18.046
Let the folderols begin!

33:24.847 --> 33:26.726
I'm here to work.

33:26.727 --> 33:29.006
Gentlemen, may I present

33:29.007 --> 33:31.526
a new and exotic addition to our house.

33:31.527 --> 33:33.246
Well, I never!

33:33.247 --> 33:36.486
By George, a black Venus.

33:36.487 --> 33:39.926
I am Dido, Queen of Carthage,

33:39.927 --> 33:43.222
fated to the underworld
for daring to love.

33:43.807 --> 33:45.286
Who dares love me?

33:45.287 --> 33:47.582
- Oh!
- Very nice.

33:48.047 --> 33:50.726
Now that's how a whore
makes an entrance.

33:50.727 --> 33:52.846
- Welcome, sir.
- Ladies.

34:07.386 --> 34:09.246
Look at you!

34:09.246 --> 34:10.766
I know!

34:48.596 --> 34:51.463
You promised me a
glimpse without your mask.

34:51.806 --> 34:53.525
You're too much, sir.

34:55.527 --> 34:56.886
Not now.

35:00.647 --> 35:02.888
You could almost be one of us.

35:08.287 --> 35:10.086
Your jealousy is absurd.

35:10.087 --> 35:12.286
He came with the Reptons,
I hardly know him.

35:12.287 --> 35:15.046
You think I don't know what
a faithless whore you are?

35:15.047 --> 35:16.166
You're right.

35:16.167 --> 35:17.806
I've pleasured every one of your friends

35:17.807 --> 35:19.206
behind your back,

35:19.207 --> 35:22.246
and we laugh at what a
credulous ass you are.

aren't you?

36:52.445 --> 36:54.084
I don't know, sir.

36:55.327 --> 36:57.206
She was tricked into the underworld

36:57.207 --> 36:58.766
by eating pomegranate seeds.

36:58.767 --> 37:01.046
Come, Fallon, the games await.

37:04.469 --> 37:07.126
I'll take you to my underworld...

37:07.127 --> 37:08.686
one day.

37:12.327 --> 37:14.606
And a choir of heavenly bishops

37:14.607 --> 37:17.046
with buttocks opalescent as the moon

37:17.047 --> 37:19.126
will descend on the House of Wells...

37:19.127 --> 37:20.646
Go and seek the best culls

37:20.647 --> 37:23.145
and bring them away as fast as possible.

37:23.527 --> 37:25.326
- Lord Fallon.
- Mr. Osborne.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.566
No wonder you're leaving.

37:26.567 --> 37:28.145
Here is much finer sport.

37:29.287 --> 37:31.491
Go and finger your mother, Quigley.

37:33.087 --> 37:35.529
Donations, please.

37:37.407 --> 37:38.686
Thank you.

37:48.321 --> 37:50.846
That gets them in, not you.

37:50.847 --> 37:53.566
Twice as much again if
you want to gain entry.

38:09.527 --> 38:11.246
Sit down and shut up.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.766
I got money to make.

38:30.647 --> 38:34.966
There's a story about a feast in hell,

38:34.967 --> 38:36.766
where the forks are so long

38:36.767 --> 38:39.926
that people can't reach their mouths,

38:39.927 --> 38:42.801
so all the diners starve to death.

38:43.207 --> 38:46.206
They don't figure out that
they can feed each other.

38:57.887 --> 38:59.744
Sir.

39:05.607 --> 39:08.406
Pleasure, treasure, and carnage.

39:08.407 --> 39:10.846
I've always wanted to fuck royalty.

39:12.847 --> 39:16.926
Your dusky queen is
too delicious to resist.

39:19.127 --> 39:20.806
Four guineas for royalty.

39:52.647 --> 39:55.846
I was determined to be the first...

39:55.847 --> 39:57.722
to have you.

39:58.367 --> 40:00.526
You're a powerful man.

40:00.527 --> 40:02.943
I bet you always get what you want.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.726
Oh, I do.

40:08.367 --> 40:10.488
But tonight,

40:11.127 --> 40:12.755
I'm your queen,

40:13.167 --> 40:15.349
and you're my subject.

40:16.054 --> 40:18.002
And you're going to do...

40:18.727 --> 40:20.206
what I want.

40:28.767 --> 40:30.606
You're no queen.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.166
You're a goddess.

40:39.527 --> 40:41.286
I don't want no quarrel with her.

40:41.287 --> 40:44.366
I'll smile and smile
and bring you new custom.

40:44.367 --> 40:47.046
Mrs. Quigley does not
appreciate my talents.

40:55.607 --> 40:57.166
How much do you owe?

40:57.167 --> 40:59.526
Sixty, but I'll earn you three

40:59.527 --> 41:02.073
every time a penis comes my way.

41:03.257 --> 41:05.433
Sounds like a fair exchange.

41:07.327 --> 41:09.206
Quarrel be damned.

41:09.207 --> 41:11.079
I'll hide you upstairs.

41:11.407 --> 41:12.806
Go on.

41:23.247 --> 41:26.931
Well, I always knew you were a whore.

41:27.407 --> 41:29.206
For the first time in my life,

41:29.207 --> 41:30.686
I am paid.

41:44.527 --> 41:47.406
Well, aren't you full of surprises?

41:47.407 --> 41:48.766
Your lordship.

41:48.767 --> 41:51.726
There's a debt to pleasure
you still haven't paid,

41:51.727 --> 41:54.206
and we must remedy
that, don't you think?

41:54.207 --> 41:55.966
I have to speak to my mother.

41:55.967 --> 41:57.985
So she can charge me again?

41:59.207 --> 42:01.206
It's time to make good,

42:01.207 --> 42:02.766
loyal Lucy.

42:15.527 --> 42:17.166
There you are.

42:29.167 --> 42:31.086
Trying to keep out of trouble.

42:33.607 --> 42:34.966
Don't.

42:48.847 --> 42:51.258
Charlotte, you harlot.

42:52.087 --> 42:53.886
Keep your hands off my pirate.

42:53.887 --> 42:56.110
He's yours for the taking.

42:57.527 --> 42:59.966
Why are you hiding down here?

43:01.767 --> 43:05.246
Don't you want to sail on the high seas?

43:05.247 --> 43:07.183
Of course I do.

43:07.967 --> 43:10.246
My desire is an ocean.

43:10.247 --> 43:12.326
Spill it into me, you brute creature,

43:12.327 --> 43:13.766
you corsair.

43:13.767 --> 43:16.547
Now, on this table.

43:25.127 --> 43:26.766
Get off her, you're disgusting!

43:26.767 --> 43:29.200
Your sister doesn't
seem to think so, do you?

43:29.807 --> 43:31.446
- Do you?
- No.

43:31.447 --> 43:32.766
Maybe now you'll think twice

43:32.767 --> 43:35.246
before you lick honey
from that Irish rake.

43:36.927 --> 43:38.406
Just go.

43:49.207 --> 43:52.286
You gave Margaret Wells my girl?

43:52.287 --> 43:54.366
They spirited her away,
I couldn't find her.

43:54.367 --> 43:55.886
You went to that bitch's kennel

43:55.887 --> 43:57.406
with three pieces of my property.

43:57.407 --> 43:59.046
What did you think would happen?

43:59.047 --> 44:00.606
We meant to steal her trade.

44:00.607 --> 44:02.126
Yes, and instead, she stole mine.

44:02.127 --> 44:04.046
You let that she-hound
run rings around you,

44:04.047 --> 44:06.246
just like that sly harpy upstairs.

44:06.247 --> 44:07.606
Oh, you're a man, all right.

44:07.607 --> 44:09.086
Your brain always in your breeches,

44:09.087 --> 44:10.326
too swollen to think.

44:10.327 --> 44:11.762
That's hardly fair.

44:13.087 --> 44:14.854
I should've had a girl.

44:15.247 --> 44:17.046
No daughter of mine
would've allowed herself

44:17.047 --> 44:18.766
to be duped by a whore.

44:18.767 --> 44:21.268
Why were you the one I chose to keep?

44:36.767 --> 44:38.447
Move aside.

44:42.687 --> 44:44.967
I am not yours to command!
