02:44.741 --> 02:47.308
I told my grandma I'd be home
for breakfast in the morning.

02:49.312 --> 02:51.846

She, um, said that watching
the woman who inspired our song

08:25.616 --> 08:27.382
would inspire me.

But it just made me realize
I'm the B-team.

"B" as in "brilliant"?

08:31.522 --> 08:34.255

or "breathtaking" or...

08:34.256 --> 08:35.457

08:40.664 --> 08:42.263

08:42.265 --> 08:45.132
I totally lost my voice
and I couldn't sing.

08:45.134 --> 08:46.502
- What did you do?
- I was doing everything.

08:46.504 --> 08:48.403
I was gargling salt water,
I was drinking tea,

08:48.405 --> 08:51.573
I was rubbing peppermint oil
all over my body, but...

08:51.575 --> 08:55.209
my big sister Becks
gave me this.

08:55.211 --> 08:57.345
It's been passed down
from Mu to Mu for generations,

08:57.347 --> 09:01.450
and it's meant to give
whatever sister has it courage.

09:01.452 --> 09:03.117
I swear to God,
the second I put it

09:03.119 --> 09:04.686
in my hair, my voice came back.

09:04.688 --> 09:05.687
- Whoa.
- Calories, please.

09:05.689 --> 09:07.221
I'm glad to know I'm not

09:07.223 --> 09:08.291
the only one who gets nervous.

09:09.359 --> 09:11.060
Here.

09:13.564 --> 09:15.664
Wait, are you...
are you giving this to me?

09:15.666 --> 09:17.365
Mm-hmm.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.133
As your designated big sister,

09:19.135 --> 09:20.869
it's my job
to take care of you.

09:20.871 --> 09:22.270
That's what I'm gonna do.

09:22.272 --> 09:24.272
Wow. Thank you.

09:28.679 --> 09:29.711
Hey, Mom.

09:29.713 --> 09:31.212
Yeah. Yeah, no, no.

09:31.214 --> 09:33.114

I'd call you back,

09:33.116 --> 09:35.384

09:35.386 --> 09:36.654

09:48.699 --> 09:50.465

09:50.467 --> 09:53.435
Is it bad we're calling it
"orphans' dinner,"

09:53.437 --> 09:54.703
since you're a...

09:54.705 --> 09:57.073
Wait, my parents are dead?

09:57.908 --> 09:59.173
I...

09:59.175 --> 10:00.475
I'm kidding.

10:00.477 --> 10:02.544
You can totally call it
the "orphans' dinner."

10:02.546 --> 10:04.178
Oh.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.647
Okay, good, 'cause I thought
it sounded cute,

10:05.649 --> 10:07.382
like Dickensian or something.

10:07.384 --> 10:09.283
Where do you want me
to put this?

10:09.285 --> 10:11.386
Oh, you can keep it.
I never wear it anymore.

10:11.388 --> 10:13.722
Christmas is the time
for looking sexy, Riley.

10:13.724 --> 10:15.222
I thought that was Halloween.

10:15.224 --> 10:16.324
Technically,
it's every holiday.

10:16.326 --> 10:18.393
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Um, can someone figure out

10:18.395 --> 10:19.360
how to turn that thing off?

10:19.362 --> 10:21.730
It, like, woke me up
at 4:00 in the morning.

10:21.732 --> 10:22.931
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Thank you.

10:22.933 --> 10:26.501
I'll leave it here for you
for when you change your mind.

10:26.503 --> 10:28.570
- I won't.
- You will.

10:28.572 --> 10:30.204
I won't.

10:30.206 --> 10:31.640
Bye. Have a good break.

10:31.642 --> 10:33.642
- Grab the duffel.
- Bye, Riley.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.817
After break, man.

11:15.819 --> 11:17.419
It's in the Myers building.

11:33.302 --> 11:36.638
"Men, bonding together,

11:36.640 --> 11:41.308
"invented culture as a defense
against female nature.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.812
"Sky-cult was
the most sophisticated step

11:43.814 --> 11:46.581
"in this process,
for its switch

11:46.583 --> 11:49.283
"of the creative locus
from earth to sky

11:49.285 --> 11:53.424
"is a shift from belly magic
to head magic.

11:54.725 --> 11:56.792
"And from this
defensive head magic

11:56.794 --> 12:01.328
"has come the spectacular glory
of male civilization,

12:01.330 --> 12:03.232
"which has lifted woman with it.

"The very language and logic

12:06.335 --> 12:09.404
"modern woman uses
to assail patriarchal culture

12:09.406 --> 12:12.040
were the invention of men."

12:12.042 --> 12:14.042
Now, who here can tell me

12:14.044 --> 12:17.213
what they think this writer
is trying to suggest?

12:20.417 --> 12:21.552
Miss Stone.

12:25.354 --> 12:26.755
U-Um...

12:26.757 --> 12:30.759
I think that he's saying

12:30.761 --> 12:34.496
that women think
with their instincts

12:34.498 --> 12:38.500
and men think
with their brains,

12:38.502 --> 12:42.871
and that women
live in men's worlds

12:42.873 --> 12:44.806
whether they like it or not.

12:44.808 --> 12:46.675
You said "he."

12:46.677 --> 12:49.511
What makes you think
the author is a man?

12:49.513 --> 12:50.912
I...

12:50.914 --> 12:56.451
It may surprise you to know
that the writer is one

12:56.453 --> 12:59.389
Dr. Camille...

13:01.357 --> 13:03.458
...Paglia.

13:05.395 --> 13:07.863
Now, I just wanted to show you
that there is no way of writing

13:07.865 --> 13:10.766
that is inherently
male or female.

13:10.768 --> 13:14.770
And it's very difficult
for me to do my job,

13:14.772 --> 13:18.372
teaching the curriculum,
which does happen to contain

13:18.374 --> 13:20.675
many white male writers,

13:20.677 --> 13:26.548
when there's a petition
circulating to have me fired.

13:26.550 --> 13:31.386
I have no nefarious plot to
secret away knowledge from you.

13:31.388 --> 13:33.922
There are no "covert meetings"
in hidden rooms

13:33.924 --> 13:35.757
where men discuss
how to bury women.

13:35.759 --> 13:39.127
You, or more likely
your parents,

13:39.129 --> 13:41.696
are paying a great deal of money

13:41.698 --> 13:43.765
for you to study
the proper classics.

13:43.767 --> 13:46.804
And it's my job
to present them to you.

13:47.838 --> 13:49.604
Enjoy your winter breaks.

13:49.606 --> 13:52.574
And a Merry Christmas
to you all.

13:55.546 --> 13:57.145
Hi there. Do you want
to sign my petition against

13:57.147 --> 13:58.713
Professor Gelson
and the ruthless misogyny

13:58.715 --> 14:00.715
of higher education...

14:00.717 --> 14:02.884
Hi. Um, do you want
to sign my petition?

14:02.886 --> 14:04.519
- Uh, sure.
- It's against Professor Gelson.

14:04.521 --> 14:05.787
I don't know.

14:05.789 --> 14:08.657
I just don't really feel like
dealing with my mom right now.

14:08.659 --> 14:10.458
She's just...

14:10.460 --> 14:13.762
It doesn't surprise me at all
that my dad left her.

14:13.764 --> 14:16.598
Anyways, I'm excited to spend
the break with you guys.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.869
A little less excited for the
dance tonight at DKO, but...

14:20.871 --> 14:23.605
Are you sure you're cool
with us doing it?

14:23.607 --> 14:25.540
...higher education. Hi!

14:25.542 --> 14:26.708
Gelson's going down!

14:26.710 --> 14:28.443
Would you like to sign my...
Okay.

14:28.445 --> 14:29.845
50 signatures and counting,

14:29.847 --> 14:31.746
and this is the beginning
of winter break,

14:31.748 --> 14:33.748
when traditionally
no one cares about anything.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.984
You already got the college
to remove the founder's bust

14:35.986 --> 14:37.786
from the
administration building.

14:37.788 --> 14:40.755
Isn't that enough crusading
for one semester, Kris?

14:40.757 --> 14:42.190
- Uh, no.
- Oh.

14:42.192 --> 14:43.959
Calvin Hawthorne was
a racist and a sexist.

14:43.961 --> 14:46.761
He owned slaves.
In the North.

14:46.763 --> 14:49.464
Seriously. He was into
the dark arts and shit.

14:49.466 --> 14:51.633
I read he, like,
killed disobedient women

14:51.635 --> 14:53.835
in ritual sacrifices
to male pagan gods.

14:53.837 --> 14:56.638
Oh, my God, Kris.
You actually believe that?

14:56.640 --> 14:58.640
And it's not like they
destroyed the freakin' thing.

14:58.642 --> 14:59.941
The Dekes took it to their frat,

14:59.943 --> 15:01.710
and now they can
junk off onto it

15:01.712 --> 15:02.944
and no one has to see it.

15:02.946 --> 15:04.913
Everyone wins.

15:06.617 --> 15:08.650
- Where are you going?
- Work.

15:08.652 --> 15:10.018
Ooh, cool.
I need coffee.

15:16.793 --> 15:18.693
I still don't understand

15:18.695 --> 15:20.662
why you want to get him
fired so bad.

15:20.664 --> 15:22.530
Uh, 'cause he went
totally crazy on me

15:22.532 --> 15:25.467
when all I did was ask why his
syllabus has no women on it,

15:25.469 --> 15:27.035
queer people on it,
trans people on it,

15:27.037 --> 15:29.671
- people of color on it.
- Yeah, but, uh, I mean,

15:29.673 --> 15:32.040
are we just supposed
to not study the classics?

15:32.042 --> 15:34.678
Whose classics are they?
'Cause they're not mine.

15:36.013 --> 15:38.747
Will you at least
sign my petition?

15:38.749 --> 15:39.981
You of all people should care.

15:39.983 --> 15:43.551
What happened to Riley is a
completely different thing than

15:43.553 --> 15:45.687
- what happened to you, Kris.
- I am just saying

15:45.689 --> 15:47.055
that she might want
to get involved because

15:47.057 --> 15:48.957
she understands that
if we let men get away with

15:48.959 --> 15:50.892
- this sort of behavior...
- "She" is right here, you guys.

15:50.894 --> 15:53.261
Let men get away
with this sort of behavior,

15:53.263 --> 15:54.829
then they'll get away
with everything.

15:54.831 --> 15:55.964
They already do.

15:55.966 --> 15:57.832
I thought we were sisters.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.869
No? Fine. I get it.

16:00.871 --> 16:03.738
You guys don't want to fight
the good fight.

16:03.740 --> 16:05.840
You don't want to confront
the white supremacist

16:05.842 --> 16:07.509
- patriarchy head-on.
- Kris, come on.

16:07.511 --> 16:09.077
- Split a snickerdoodle with me?
- No, no. Nope.

16:09.079 --> 16:10.912
It's fine. I get it.

16:10.914 --> 16:12.681
I'll sign it.

16:12.683 --> 16:14.049
Excuse me?

16:14.051 --> 16:16.017
Yeah. I mean,
I-I thought it was cool

16:16.019 --> 16:19.287
that you got them to get rid
of Calvin Hawthorne's bust.

16:19.289 --> 16:20.822
It was kind of creepy.

16:20.824 --> 16:23.124
Uh, and the way

16:23.126 --> 16:25.996
Professor Gelson yelled at you
in class was really lame.

16:28.031 --> 16:29.631
Sorry for the wait.

16:29.633 --> 16:31.902
No worries.
I... I don't mind waiting.

16:35.038 --> 16:37.906
Sorry. That was really...

16:37.908 --> 16:38.909
Thank you.

16:42.079 --> 16:44.079
Okay, fine.
Give it to me.

16:44.081 --> 16:46.014
Thank you.
And you know what?

16:46.016 --> 16:48.618
I would love to split
a snickerdoodle with you.

16:51.922 --> 16:53.621
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Excuse me.

16:53.623 --> 16:54.656
Sorry.

16:54.658 --> 16:56.157
- Oh. After you.
- Thank you.

16:56.159 --> 16:57.993
Yeah, yeah.

16:57.995 --> 16:59.963
Yeah.

17:07.704 --> 17:09.904
Oh, you can take this back.

17:09.906 --> 17:10.906
Oh, no.

17:12.576 --> 17:13.808
What's up, ladies?

17:13.810 --> 17:15.012
Can I get an iced coffee?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.680
Excited for tonight?

17:18.682 --> 17:20.181
Brian's gonna be there.

17:20.183 --> 17:22.916
He's coming up from D.C.
to meet the new pledges.

17:22.919 --> 17:24.652
The only place
Brian Huntley belongs

17:24.654 --> 17:26.656
is in jail
for what he did to Riley.

17:27.691 --> 17:29.924
We're going skiing together.

17:29.926 --> 17:32.062
Don't worry.
It's consensual.

17:33.597 --> 17:35.163
Screw you, Phil.

17:35.165 --> 17:38.135
And tell Brian to stay
the hell away from Riley.

17:39.169 --> 17:40.804
Keep the change.

17:43.006 --> 17:45.173
What should we do?

17:45.175 --> 17:48.076
We could pull out,
be conscientious objectors like

17:48.078 --> 17:49.677
Lindsay and the Delta Sig girls

17:49.679 --> 17:51.380
and skip the performance
altogether.

17:51.382 --> 17:53.114
You've been trying to get
out of this for three weeks.

17:53.116 --> 17:54.383
Come on, we're not bailing.

17:54.385 --> 17:56.718
- I'll be fine.
- Are you sure?

17:56.720 --> 17:59.154
It was three years ago.
I can handle it.

17:59.156 --> 18:01.158
What's the worst
that can happen?

18:21.878 --> 18:24.112
Do women say the word "dump"?

18:24.114 --> 18:26.181
I mean, uh, yeah.

18:26.183 --> 18:29.884
I hate these little cutie names
for just taking a shit.

18:29.886 --> 18:31.920
I don't think
we say cutie names, do we?

18:31.922 --> 18:33.721
Is he here?
Did you see him?

18:33.723 --> 18:34.989
I mean, there's
definitely a difference.

18:34.991 --> 18:36.057
I don't know.

18:36.059 --> 18:38.226
That's okay.
That's okay.

18:38.228 --> 18:40.028
- You guys look so hot.
- Smoosh, can you

18:40.030 --> 18:42.097
- take a photo of all of us?
- Of course.

18:42.099 --> 18:44.067
That's what I'm here for.

18:46.236 --> 18:48.036
Ooh.

18:48.038 --> 18:50.038
Oh, daddy.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.206
What are you doing?
Come on.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.074
Yeah.

18:53.076 --> 18:55.110
Whoo. Mm-mmm.

18:55.112 --> 18:56.111
You ready?

18:56.113 --> 18:58.046
Three, two, one.

18:58.048 --> 18:59.781
Cheese.

18:59.783 --> 19:02.117
- Got it.
- I'm glad I wore my push-up bra.

19:02.119 --> 19:04.453
Yeah, okay.

19:04.455 --> 19:06.455
My little documentarian.

19:06.457 --> 19:07.755
I love you so much, baby.

19:07.757 --> 19:09.057
Where's Helena?

19:09.059 --> 19:10.758
Oh, she was pounding
vodka sodas earlier,

19:10.760 --> 19:12.026
but she looked really good.

19:12.028 --> 19:13.895
Are you okay, Smoosh?

19:13.897 --> 19:15.464
Yeah. It's just
an allergy headache. I'm fine.

19:15.466 --> 19:17.765
Seriously, if she screws
this up, I'm gonna kill her.

19:17.767 --> 19:18.933
Says the girl
who projectile vomited

19:18.935 --> 19:20.935
at Sophomore Salad Soiree.

19:20.937 --> 19:22.837
I'm gonna go look for her.

19:22.839 --> 19:26.107
- "Woman."
- "Woman," sorry, who projectile vomited

19:26.109 --> 19:28.076
at Sophomore Salad Soiree.

20:17.961 --> 20:19.095
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

20:20.931 --> 20:23.133
The founder wills it so.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.842
Watch it, pledge.
Break that, and it's all over.

20:34.844 --> 20:37.178
You'll never be
part of the Deke army.

20:37.180 --> 20:40.181
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

20:40.183 --> 20:42.984
The power of the founder
compels you

20:42.986 --> 20:46.354
to pledge your loyalty to DKO.

20:46.356 --> 20:48.856
The founder wills it so.

20:59.102 --> 21:02.870
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

21:02.872 --> 21:05.875
The power
of the founder compels you.

21:24.395 --> 21:26.162
No, stop.

21:38.341 --> 21:40.442
You are so sexy.

21:40.444 --> 21:42.812
- I want you so bad.
- Wait.

21:45.882 --> 21:47.317
Wait. Wait.

21:49.252 --> 21:51.620
Wait.
Phil, wait. Wait.

21:51.622 --> 21:53.921
- Helena?
- Dude, what the hell?

21:53.923 --> 21:56.057
I've been looking for you.

21:56.059 --> 21:58.126
Right, you found her,
so get the hell out.

21:58.128 --> 22:00.328
The girls want to practice
dance one more time.

22:00.330 --> 22:03.298
I-I guess, I guess
I got to, I got to...

22:03.300 --> 22:04.968
We were in the middle
of something.

22:06.002 --> 22:07.837
Do you want me to leave?

22:13.310 --> 22:15.477
You bitches are all the same.

22:15.479 --> 22:18.815
You act like you want it, but
you're all a bunch of teases.

22:21.318 --> 22:24.386
You know, Brian would never
have done what you said he did.

22:33.431 --> 22:35.063
You okay?

22:35.065 --> 22:36.465
I don't feel...

22:36.467 --> 22:40.902
Does vodka mix well
with tequila?

22:40.904 --> 22:43.237
Yeah, get it all out.

22:46.677 --> 22:50.244
Well, that'll be a really nice
Christmas gift for him.

22:55.285 --> 22:58.387
I am such an idiot.

22:58.389 --> 23:01.390
You're not an idiot.

23:01.392 --> 23:03.427
I just thought he was cute.

23:05.463 --> 23:07.261
Should I take you home?

23:07.263 --> 23:09.997
No.

23:09.999 --> 23:12.367
No, you stay here.

23:12.369 --> 23:14.904
You can let the girls down
easy for me.

23:16.172 --> 23:18.139
Will you promise
you're gonna text me

23:18.141 --> 23:19.309
as soon as you get home?

23:22.546 --> 23:25.012
Promise.

23:25.014 --> 23:27.014
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- All right.

23:27.016 --> 23:28.450
Oh, daddy.

23:28.452 --> 23:30.419
Where is she?

23:30.421 --> 23:32.554
- I put her in an Uber.
- Is she okay?

23:32.556 --> 23:34.290
She's fine.
She just ate something bad.

23:36.527 --> 23:38.025
What? She did.

23:38.027 --> 23:40.027
Maybe it's a sign
we shouldn't sing.

23:40.029 --> 23:41.197
Ow.

23:43.233 --> 23:46.134
No. Absolutely not.

23:46.136 --> 23:48.136
Are you kidding me?

23:48.138 --> 23:49.738
You've been coaching us
for three weeks,

23:49.740 --> 23:52.240
you know the choreography,
and you sing.

23:52.242 --> 23:53.409
Yeah, but he's here.

23:53.411 --> 23:55.345
It's all the more reason
to do it.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.515
Jesse, what do you think?

23:59.583 --> 24:02.285
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
What am I supposed to say?

24:03.554 --> 24:06.154
This way of life
is unsustainable, Riley.

24:06.156 --> 24:08.990
What Brian did to you...
it's awful.

24:08.992 --> 24:11.225
And it's terrible
that nobody believed you.

24:11.227 --> 24:14.262
But you can't just sit on
the sidelines alone forever.

24:14.264 --> 24:16.398
You're gonna keep
shrinking and shrinking

24:16.400 --> 24:18.366
until there's
nothing left of you.

24:18.368 --> 24:19.367
Hmm?

24:19.369 --> 24:22.071
You used to be a fighter.

24:23.139 --> 24:24.974
It's time to be a fighter again.

24:27.277 --> 24:31.380
If not for yourself,
for your sisters?

24:37.253 --> 24:38.554

26:54.157 --> 26:55.189
Come on! Hey!

26:55.191 --> 26:56.458
Let's go!

26:56.460 --> 26:58.159
Let's leave. Let's go.

26:58.161 --> 27:00.929
Just keep going.

27:00.931 --> 27:02.531
Look what I got!

27:02.533 --> 27:04.499
I can't believe
I just fucking did that!

27:04.501 --> 27:06.602
Baby Jesus is
smiling down on you, Riley,

27:06.604 --> 27:08.537
and he wants to thank you
for such a good birthday.

27:08.539 --> 27:09.605
- Did you see their faces?
- I was ready... I know.

27:09.607 --> 27:11.573
I was ready to pee myself.
I wasn't even onstage.

27:11.575 --> 27:13.742
- Oh, my God. - I had no idea...
- Riley!

27:13.744 --> 27:15.477
It's the North Pole's
best kept secret.

27:15.479 --> 27:16.545
Oh, really?

27:16.547 --> 27:18.380
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, uh...

27:18.382 --> 27:21.315
- it's Riley, right?
- Yeah.

27:21.317 --> 27:23.652
Um, that was really good.

27:23.654 --> 27:25.186
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

27:25.188 --> 27:26.388
Uh, I was really impressed.

27:26.390 --> 27:28.157
That-that takes guts.

27:30.259 --> 27:32.761
Uh, I'm Landon.

27:32.763 --> 27:35.464
Hey, guys, come on.

27:35.466 --> 27:37.298
Cake. Let's go sneak
into the café.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.300
- Come on.
- No. I should probably go home.

27:39.302 --> 27:41.603
- No. It is midnight on our last day...
- I...

27:41.605 --> 27:44.271
...of our last fall semester
of college ever.

27:44.273 --> 27:45.807
You're not bailing.
Come on. Live a little.

27:45.809 --> 27:48.275
Do you want to come with us?

27:48.277 --> 27:50.479
Uh... nah, I got to...

27:50.481 --> 27:52.681
Yeah. I-I'm-I'm probably
gonna go home any...

27:52.683 --> 27:54.348
Why am I telling you that?

27:54.350 --> 27:56.685
- Like, okay.
- Ugh.

27:56.687 --> 27:58.252
Hey, you know what?

27:58.254 --> 28:01.322
Actually,
screw those Dekes, man.

28:01.324 --> 28:02.457
They suck.

28:02.459 --> 28:04.459
- Uh, they can return the equipment.
- Okay, well, let me

28:04.461 --> 28:05.326
just text my friend Helena,

28:05.328 --> 28:06.461
- make sure she got home okay.
- Okay.

28:06.463 --> 28:08.295
Mm, she already sent
a group text to all of us.

28:08.297 --> 28:10.799
Says, "How is swiff.

28:10.801 --> 28:13.300
"Traking the ampersant
30 train tom.

28:13.302 --> 28:15.302
See you next yeat!"

28:15.304 --> 28:17.472
- So, I think we're all good.
- All right. Let's go.

28:17.474 --> 28:18.540
Yay!

28:18.542 --> 28:20.341
Landon, you can hold this.

28:20.343 --> 28:22.343
Thank you.

28:56.613 --> 28:58.447
Oh, wait. Okay. Uh, f...

28:58.449 --> 29:00.482
I've got one.

29:00.484 --> 29:03.719
Um, why is Santa Claus scared

29:03.721 --> 29:05.654
of getting stuck
in the chimney?

29:07.057 --> 29:11.325
Oh, this is gonna be bad.

29:11.327 --> 29:14.596
Because he's claustrophobic.

29:14.598 --> 29:16.431
- Mm, that's actually not so bad.
- Not so bad.

29:16.433 --> 29:17.364
- Not so b...
- Not so...

29:17.366 --> 29:20.502
It's pretty, it's pretty good.

29:20.504 --> 29:22.771
Are you going to invite
your new friend

29:22.773 --> 29:24.673
over for our
orphans' Christmas dinner?

29:24.675 --> 29:26.742
"Orphans' Christmas dinner"?

29:26.744 --> 29:30.545
It's, like, a potluck we do
for anybody

29:30.547 --> 29:32.547
who's left over here
over the break.

29:32.549 --> 29:34.082
7:00. Are you here?

29:34.084 --> 29:35.884
Uh, yeah.
I don't leave until Sunday.

29:35.886 --> 29:38.352
So... I mean, is that o...

29:38.354 --> 29:39.621
- Are you cool... with...
- Mm.

29:39.623 --> 29:40.624
Okay.

29:41.658 --> 29:43.692
Good girl.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.527
Let's not pretend
like I'm the only one.

29:45.529 --> 29:47.896
I'm wearing a thong
and some other underwear.

29:47.898 --> 29:49.731
I'm not wearing anything.

29:49.733 --> 29:52.768
How come you've never
talked to me before?

29:52.770 --> 29:55.304
You come into the café
every day.

29:56.573 --> 29:58.575
I, um...

30:00.110 --> 30:04.112
I... uh, it just takes me
a while to figure out how to...

30:04.114 --> 30:06.414
approach things.

30:06.416 --> 30:07.816
But don't give up
on me, though.

30:07.818 --> 30:11.486
I... I always
figure it out eventually.

30:11.488 --> 30:13.423
- Mm.
- So...

31:44.014 --> 31:46.648
Hello?

31:46.650 --> 31:47.985
Anyone there?

32:44.875 --> 32:47.809
The star of the evening.

32:47.811 --> 32:50.111
I can't believe you did that
in front of Brian last night.

32:50.113 --> 32:52.514
What?

32:52.516 --> 32:53.982
I don't know. I thought
I'd feel good about it,

32:53.984 --> 32:55.283
but I just feel weird.

32:55.285 --> 32:57.521
Dude. You won.

32:58.722 --> 32:59.854
Enjoy it.

32:59.856 --> 33:01.658
All right.

33:02.592 --> 33:03.992
I got to pack.

33:03.994 --> 33:05.927
My sister... biological...

33:05.929 --> 33:07.996
will string me up
if I'm late for the train.

33:07.998 --> 33:10.031
Promise to
take good care of Claudette.

33:10.033 --> 33:12.133
- I promise.
- And don't overfeed her.

33:12.135 --> 33:13.935
It took an entire year
to slim her down

33:13.937 --> 33:14.936
after last winter break.

33:14.938 --> 33:16.938
Happy holidays, Franny.

33:16.940 --> 33:20.010
Hey, Merry Christmas
from this Jew to you.

33:24.948 --> 33:27.048
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
We've got errands to run.

33:27.050 --> 33:29.084
- Has anyone seen my mitten?
- Hey. He's stressing me out.

33:29.086 --> 33:30.752
He's in father goose mode.

33:30.754 --> 33:32.620
- It'll pass.
- Has anyone seen my other mitten?

33:32.622 --> 33:34.155
- Let's go!
- I think someone was here

33:34.157 --> 33:35.957
- from DKO last night.
- What? Why?

33:35.959 --> 33:37.959
Look, it's the same stuff
that was at the frat.

33:37.961 --> 33:39.894
- Why is all our stuff missing?
- Cheap champagne will do that.

33:39.896 --> 33:41.763
What do you think it is?
Do you think it's paint?

33:41.765 --> 33:43.932
- The dirty junk of frat boy scum.
- No, I'm serious.

33:43.934 --> 33:45.734
I think they're planning
a prank or something.

33:45.736 --> 33:47.902
Ah, right. The classic
painting the cat's paws prank.

33:47.904 --> 33:50.171
They probably took Jesse's crystal,

33:50.173 --> 33:51.673
my mitten
and Fran's DivaCup, too.

33:51.675 --> 33:52.774
Ho, ho, ho.

33:52.776 --> 33:54.175
Okay. If the girth of this tree

33:54.177 --> 33:56.077
isn't how I want it,
I know I'm blaming you guys

33:56.079 --> 33:57.645
'cause you took
frickin' forever to get ready.

33:57.647 --> 33:58.613
We can't control
a girth of a tree.

33:58.615 --> 34:00.081
Well, yeah, you can.
If we got there in time,

34:00.083 --> 34:00.982
there would... I don't know.

34:00.984 --> 34:02.884
Nate, did you get
this door fixed yet?

34:02.886 --> 34:04.085
- Let's go! Riley, come on!
- Coming.

34:04.087 --> 34:05.820
I'm coming.

34:05.822 --> 34:07.989
Ow.

34:09.926 --> 34:11.126
Drive, drive, drive!

34:11.128 --> 34:12.159
Good?

34:12.161 --> 34:13.797
Let's do it.

34:22.172 --> 34:23.806
Claudette?

34:29.646 --> 34:30.844
Claudette?

34:32.114 --> 34:34.117
Claudette?
Are you in here?

34:43.025 --> 34:44.958
If you make me late
for the train,

34:44.960 --> 34:46.963
I swear I'm never
feeding you again.

34:48.965 --> 34:50.931
Ask my childhood hamster.

34:50.934 --> 34:52.936
He's super dead.

34:55.172 --> 34:57.839
Claudette? Seriously.

34:57.841 --> 34:59.843
Where are you?

35:03.213 --> 35:05.747
Sweetheart?

35:05.749 --> 35:07.682
Where are you?

35:11.021 --> 35:13.023
Are you hurt, angel?

35:19.729 --> 35:21.665
Oh, there you are.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.867
Ooh, I like that one.
The tree the guy has.

35:25.869 --> 35:27.936
That means it's taken. Mm-hmm.

35:27.938 --> 35:29.904
Options.

35:29.906 --> 35:32.774
That's a little bit of you, isn't it?

35:32.776 --> 35:34.008
- This one's, you know, humble.
- Mm?

35:34.010 --> 35:35.043
This guy's leaning.

35:35.045 --> 35:36.678
- I think you...
- Humble?

35:36.680 --> 35:38.146
I think this one deserves
a loving home.

35:38.148 --> 35:41.216
- Guys, this one.
- Yeah.

35:41.218 --> 35:43.051
No.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.053
- This is it.
- Kris.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.122
- I cannot afford something that big.
- No, it's okay.

35:47.124 --> 35:49.791
My dad left me his card
so I can spend whatever I want

35:49.793 --> 35:52.160
over winter break 'cause he
bailed on our St. Barts trip.

35:52.162 --> 35:53.962
All right. Let's do it.

35:53.964 --> 35:55.697
- Do you need any help, baby?
- Oh.

35:55.699 --> 35:57.232
- No. I got it.
- Whoa. - Okay.

35:57.234 --> 35:58.900
You're doing the most.

35:58.902 --> 36:00.034
All right.

36:09.279 --> 36:11.045
Keep going. Keep going.

36:28.899 --> 36:30.832
Hello?

36:34.971 --> 36:36.771
Hello?

36:36.773 --> 36:38.273
Oh, thank God I got through.

36:38.275 --> 36:40.808
- It's Helena's mom.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Rittenhouse.

36:40.810 --> 36:42.810
Do you know where Helena is?

36:42.812 --> 36:45.013
She was supposed to be here
a few hours ago,

36:45.015 --> 36:47.182
and I haven't heard from her
since yesterday.

36:47.184 --> 36:49.117
I'm a little worried.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.985
Well, um,

36:50.987 --> 36:52.987
I'm not there right now,

36:52.989 --> 36:55.023
but I can check
as soon as I get back.

36:55.025 --> 36:56.057
Oh, would you?

36:56.059 --> 36:57.859
Oh, that would be,
that would be really great.

36:57.861 --> 36:59.127
- Of course.
- Thank you so much, Riley.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.962
- Okay.

- Okay, look. You just made it crooked.

39:01.918 --> 39:03.017
This is so inefficient.

My sisters and I did
this stupid performance

43:59.550 --> 44:00.782
I wouldn't worry about those.

44:00.784 --> 44:02.484
Like you say,
they're probably just

44:02.486 --> 44:04.519
pissed about
the little show you put on.

44:04.521 --> 44:07.323
Boys will be... well, you know.

44:09.258 --> 44:10.527
Can I give you a ride home?

44:12.696 --> 44:14.463
No. I'm okay.

44:14.465 --> 44:16.465
All right. Have a good break.

44:59.342 --> 45:01.376
Oh.

45:01.378 --> 45:02.744
I'm sorry.

45:02.746 --> 45:04.345
I was, um...

45:04.347 --> 45:06.313
- No, no. I'm sorry.
- I, uh...

45:06.315 --> 45:09.685
Looking for a comb that I lost.

45:09.687 --> 45:11.453
But I...

45:13.457 --> 45:15.724
I can come back.

45:15.726 --> 45:17.226
Nonsense.

45:17.795 --> 45:19.628
I have a key.

45:19.630 --> 45:21.398
Please.

45:24.468 --> 45:26.333
I promised
I'd let the cleaners in

45:26.335 --> 45:29.270
while the boys
went on their ski trip.

45:29.272 --> 45:31.305
I hope you don't mind
my saying so,

45:31.307 --> 45:36.343
but a few of the boys did
confide in me that the prank

45:36.345 --> 45:38.814
Mu Kappa played last night
went a little bit too far.

45:38.816 --> 45:42.851
I think it only right
Miss Waterson remove the video.

45:42.853 --> 45:45.821
It's online?

45:45.823 --> 45:47.489
Now, which key is it?

45:47.491 --> 45:50.559
Well, I'm not entirely sure
how these things work,

45:50.561 --> 45:52.627
but it did seem to be
heavily watched.

45:52.629 --> 45:56.064
30,000 views or something.

45:56.066 --> 45:58.767
The video she posted of me
garnered less than half that.

45:58.769 --> 46:01.335
Between this
and her petition against me,

46:01.337 --> 46:03.739
it seems Miss Waterson's
passion for equality

46:03.741 --> 46:05.743
cannot be bridled.

46:08.712 --> 46:11.715
Oh, dear.
I didn't mean to bring that up.

46:13.484 --> 46:14.783
It's just...

46:14.785 --> 46:17.488
Hawthorne means so much to me.

46:19.523 --> 46:22.591
This school has
200 years of history.

46:22.593 --> 46:26.497
Many sacrifices have been made
to keep our traditions alive.

46:30.634 --> 46:32.534
I just wanted to make sure
you're aware of

46:32.536 --> 46:35.704
the possible
legal repercussions.

46:35.706 --> 46:36.872
The public accusation
at the end

46:36.874 --> 46:38.475
could be considered defamatory.

46:41.111 --> 46:43.344
Let's see if this works,
shall we?

46:44.815 --> 46:47.883
Ah. There we go.

46:47.885 --> 46:50.519
After you.

46:50.521 --> 46:51.787
I have to go.

46:51.789 --> 46:53.757
What about your comb?

46:54.792 --> 46:57.559
Miss Stone.

47:06.837 --> 47:11.139
♪ Here comes Mary Christmas,
ready as can be... ♪

47:11.141 --> 47:13.508
I can't believe
how easy it was to cook.

47:13.510 --> 47:15.944
I could've been making ham
all my life.

47:15.946 --> 47:18.482
- Babe, can you help me a little bit?
- Mmm.

47:19.516 --> 47:21.317
Since when do you drink beer?

47:21.985 --> 47:24.386
I like beer.

47:24.388 --> 47:25.787
Okay, new game.
Top three animals.

47:25.789 --> 47:27.789
- Go.
- That's a dumb game.

47:27.791 --> 47:29.724
- Well, then you don't have to play.
- Nate.

47:29.726 --> 47:30.792
Okay. Marty, you go first.

47:30.794 --> 47:33.762
Um, I actually can't right now.
I'm a little busy.

47:33.764 --> 47:34.830
Please?

47:34.832 --> 47:37.532
Okay. Fine. Um...

47:37.534 --> 47:39.167
The first one would
probably be an owl,

47:39.169 --> 47:40.902
and then a bunny,
and then an ant.

47:40.904 --> 47:42.604
Wow.

47:42.606 --> 47:44.573
Ant. That's bold.

47:44.575 --> 47:45.807
What's the game?

47:45.809 --> 47:48.977
Okay. Number one animal, owl...
that's how you see yourself.

47:48.979 --> 47:50.545
- I see that.
- Mm-hmm.

47:50.547 --> 47:52.414
Number two animal, um, bunny...

47:52.416 --> 47:53.615
that's what you look for
in a romantic partner.

47:53.617 --> 47:54.816
Not today, apparently.

47:54.818 --> 47:56.751
And then third animal, ant...

47:56.753 --> 47:58.753
that's what you want
in friends.

47:58.755 --> 48:01.857
Why the ant, Marty?

48:01.859 --> 48:02.858
I don't know.

48:02.860 --> 48:04.759
I guess they're strong,

48:04.761 --> 48:06.795
and they're all kind of, like, one unit.

48:06.797 --> 48:08.697
Um, and you can't kill an ant

48:08.699 --> 48:10.465
because they're all
an extension of the others.

48:10.467 --> 48:11.935
That's really poetic.

48:13.537 --> 48:14.703
What the hell, Kris?!

48:14.705 --> 48:15.971
Did you talk
to campus security?

48:15.973 --> 48:17.839
You posted the video
from last night online?

48:17.841 --> 48:19.641
Yeah. Why?
Is it getting views?

48:19.643 --> 48:20.909
Did you watch it
the whole way through?

48:20.911 --> 48:21.977
Uh, I didn't need to.
I lived it.

48:21.979 --> 48:23.845
Maybe that'll
teach Brian Huntley

48:23.847 --> 48:24.980
not to rape another girl.

48:24.982 --> 48:26.516
Oh, God.

48:29.453 --> 48:31.052
- Okay.
- No. Where are you going?

48:31.054 --> 48:33.989
I'm gonna go get Christmas
lights for the dinner decor.

48:33.991 --> 48:36.458
When you guys fight,
it high-key stresses me out.

48:36.460 --> 48:38.927
Look, okay, I'm gonna cut
that part out right now.

48:38.929 --> 48:41.930
It already has, like,
50,000 views.

48:41.932 --> 48:44.699
Well, yeah.
I-I thought the point of

48:44.701 --> 48:47.636
calling out frat boy rape
culture was to inspire women.

48:47.638 --> 48:50.538
We're not inspiring people.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.973
We're pissing people off.

48:51.975 --> 48:53.942
Gelson is cornering me.

48:53.944 --> 48:57.879
I'm getting messed-up DMs
from God-knows-who.

48:57.881 --> 49:00.982
- Helena's disappeared, and now the whole world...
- Wait, wait.

49:00.984 --> 49:02.951
- Hold on. Hold on. No, no, no.
- ...knows that Brian Huntley...

49:02.953 --> 49:04.953
Wait, wait. Back up. Hold on.
You're getting weird DMs?

49:04.955 --> 49:07.555
- Yeah.
- So am I.

49:07.557 --> 49:12.027
♪ ...Mary is,
Santa's sure to go ♪

49:12.029 --> 49:14.696

Okay.

49:45.128 --> 49:46.830
Christmas lights.

49:47.831 --> 49:49.597
Christmas lights.

49:49.599 --> 49:50.699
What did Gelson say?

49:50.701 --> 49:51.833
- Kris, are you getting them?
- Yes. Just ignore them.

49:51.835 --> 49:54.602
They are boys with heavy
testicles. Did he threaten you?

49:54.604 --> 49:56.738
No. He just made it
pretty clear that he wants you

49:56.740 --> 49:57.572
to drop the petition.

49:57.574 --> 49:58.974
So he thinks
that he can threaten us

49:58.976 --> 50:00.608
and then we'll just drop this.

50:00.610 --> 50:03.778
- Okay...
- This is just getting started!

50:03.780 --> 50:05.916
- No. How about we...
- You're not listening to me!

50:08.752 --> 50:10.885
No.

50:12.055 --> 50:13.690
Bingo.

50:20.063 --> 50:21.698
Let's see.

50:23.633 --> 50:24.901
Shit.

50:26.169 --> 50:28.038
Christmas lights.

50:36.980 --> 50:38.982
Do Christmas lights expire?

50:40.784 --> 50:42.052
Ugh.

50:44.588 --> 50:46.187
Wait.

50:46.189 --> 50:48.525
Let's try these.

50:55.132 --> 50:57.732
Okay.

50:58.735 --> 50:59.834
Helena wouldn't even be missing

50:59.836 --> 51:02.137
if I'd just gone home
like I wanted to instead of

51:02.139 --> 51:03.938
you forcing me
to sing your dumb song.

51:03.940 --> 51:06.941
My song? That was my song?
We did that for you!

51:06.943 --> 51:08.810
I wouldn't have
sung it if you didn't...

51:08.812 --> 51:11.679
You're so,
you're so pushy, Kris!

51:11.681 --> 51:12.747
You never stop, do you?

51:12.749 --> 51:14.816
You just push and you push.

51:14.818 --> 51:16.084
I don't stop
because they don't stop!

51:16.086 --> 51:18.820
Well, not everybody
wants to be like you!

51:18.822 --> 51:21.656
Some of us are
quite happy to...

51:21.658 --> 51:23.660
To just disappear!

51:24.861 --> 51:26.963
What did you girls expect?

51:28.999 --> 51:30.965
- Excuse me?
- I told you something like this

51:30.967 --> 51:31.900
was gonna happen.

51:31.902 --> 51:33.935
Okay? You humiliated
those guys up there.

51:33.937 --> 51:34.903
Of course they're pissed.

51:34.905 --> 51:36.704
And that gives them
an excuse to harass us?

51:36.706 --> 51:38.706
What... If a bunch of
frat bros had gotten up

51:38.708 --> 51:39.908
and sang a song about how,

51:39.910 --> 51:40.909
I don't know,
women were just bimbos

51:40.911 --> 51:42.977
who liked to show off
their tits, then yeah,

51:42.979 --> 51:44.879
- you'd be livid.
- It's a little different, Smoosh.

51:44.881 --> 51:47.182
How? Why are you allowed to say
all this shit about men,

51:47.184 --> 51:48.950
and we're supposed to just
sit here and take it?

51:48.952 --> 51:50.587
Because men have all the power.

51:51.254 --> 51:53.788
Not all men have power.

51:53.790 --> 51:55.723
- Did you just "not all men" me? Did you just...
- Don't.

51:55.725 --> 51:57.792
Not all men are rapists, Kris!

51:57.794 --> 51:59.027
- Okay? I'm not.
- No. Nobody...

51:59.029 --> 52:01.129
But you just lump me in with
the bad ones because I'm a man?

52:01.131 --> 52:02.730
No. Nobody is calling you
a rapist.

52:02.732 --> 52:03.965
- You imply it with your man-hating.
- "Man-hating"?

52:03.967 --> 52:05.266
- What did I say that was so offensive?
- Okay.

52:05.268 --> 52:06.734
Hon, just calm down.
We're trying to have

52:06.736 --> 52:07.836
- a rational conversation.
- "Calm down"?

52:07.838 --> 52:09.804
- Yeah.
- You want me to calm down?! Let's calm down!

52:09.806 --> 52:11.739
Yeah, I want you to calm
down. Okay. You just trying...

52:11.741 --> 52:13.174
- Shut up!
- What would you do if I grabbed you like this?!

52:13.176 --> 52:14.943
- Get out! Get out!
- You know what?

52:14.945 --> 52:16.845
- You need to leave.
- The second I have a good point...

52:16.847 --> 52:18.046
- Leave! I don't give a shit!
- No, no!

52:18.048 --> 52:19.013
The second I have a good point,

52:19.015 --> 52:20.048
- you tell me to leave you?!
- Who are you?!

52:20.050 --> 52:21.149
- Get out of here!
- You know, I should've just

52:21.151 --> 52:21.916
- dumped you last semester...
- I don't give a shit!

52:21.918 --> 52:26.154
- Get out!
- You're hysterical.

52:26.156 --> 52:27.188
Jesus!

52:27.190 --> 52:28.723
Oh, my God!

52:34.231 --> 52:37.298
"I will bring you
to your knees"?

52:41.905 --> 52:43.805
"And you will beg for mercy"?

52:49.246 --> 52:52.247
- There.
- What did you just do?

52:52.249 --> 52:54.249
I said, "Hey, Calvin Hawthorne.
Why don't you come down here,

52:54.251 --> 52:56.784
bite my ass, and make me
a panini on my mom's press?"

52:56.786 --> 52:57.785
Oh, my...

53:00.257 --> 53:02.123
What was that?

53:08.265 --> 53:10.131
Run!

53:10.133 --> 53:12.936
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

53:15.272 --> 53:16.938
Come on, Marty!

53:16.940 --> 53:17.941
Come on!

53:23.213 --> 53:25.313
Ow.

53:26.816 --> 53:29.217
Oh, shit.

53:29.219 --> 53:30.854
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

53:35.025 --> 53:37.892
I knew Helena was dead.
I knew.

53:37.894 --> 53:39.894
- <i>I felt it.</i>
<i>- No, we don't know that.</i>

53:39.896 --> 53:40.762
<i>We don't know that.
All we know is</i>

53:40.764 --> 53:42.063
<i>that we need
to get out of here.</i>

53:42.065 --> 53:43.298
Who is that guy?

53:43.300 --> 53:45.033
Could be anyone...
the Dekes, Gelson.

53:45.035 --> 53:46.334
Look, we can sit here
and make a list

53:46.336 --> 53:47.969
of all the guys
that want to kill us

53:47.971 --> 53:49.771
or we could get out of here,
we could get help.

53:49.773 --> 53:50.738
I can't. I can't.

53:50.740 --> 53:51.607
- It hurts too much to move.
- You're okay.

53:51.609 --> 53:54.042
Hold this. I got you.

53:54.044 --> 53:56.311
Where's your phone, Ri?

53:56.313 --> 53:58.046
It's downstairs.

53:58.048 --> 54:00.116
Shit. I left mine downstairs.

54:01.151 --> 54:02.850
<i>Marty's bleeding really bad.</i>

54:02.852 --> 54:05.121
<i>I need to stay with her
and tend her wound.</i>

54:06.356 --> 54:08.923
Riley, we need a phone.

54:08.925 --> 54:12.160
We need to call the cops
and warn all the other girls

54:12.162 --> 54:15.098
- to stay away from that house.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

55:55.999 --> 55:59.000
<i>I know I wasn't
always on your side.</i>

55:59.002 --> 56:01.437
And I know that
we butt heads sometimes.

56:01.439 --> 56:04.372
- It's okay.
- Um...

56:04.374 --> 56:06.040
And I know that I always
lug Nate around,

56:06.042 --> 56:09.079
but I really love it
when it's just the four of us.

56:11.515 --> 56:13.116
Jesse.

56:15.151 --> 56:17.118
Oh, God.

56:17.120 --> 56:19.122
We've got to find her.

56:21.958 --> 56:24.027
We're ants, Kris.

56:26.296 --> 56:28.430
Okay.
Um, I'll do it.

56:28.432 --> 56:30.399
You just... stay here.

56:30.401 --> 56:32.302
Keep the door locked, okay?

57:48.178 --> 57:49.946
Jess?

58:15.573 --> 58:17.173
Riley?

58:18.208 --> 58:19.808
What are you doing down there?

58:19.810 --> 58:21.376
Wh-Where's Marty?

58:21.378 --> 58:23.479
I, uh, I just, I wanted to apologize.

58:23.481 --> 58:26.047
I... I was having
this intense migraine.

58:26.049 --> 58:28.082
- And I-I feel terrible.
- Nate.

58:28.084 --> 58:32.186
There's someone in the house.

58:33.657 --> 58:35.526
I need your phone.

58:40.263 --> 58:41.430
Where's Marty?

58:41.432 --> 58:42.631
Please, Nate.

58:42.633 --> 58:45.166
She's... she's hurt.

58:45.168 --> 58:48.236
And she needs a doctor,
but I need your phone.

58:48.238 --> 58:49.638
No. Screw a phone.

58:49.640 --> 58:51.607
Get the girls out of here,
all right?

58:51.609 --> 58:54.443
If someone hurts my girl,
it's my duty to protect her.

58:54.445 --> 58:56.277
Show yourself, coward!

58:56.279 --> 58:57.546
This is a man's...

59:10.326 --> 59:12.360
Stay away from me.

59:47.531 --> 59:49.565
Merry Christmas,
boys and girls.

59:49.567 --> 59:51.332
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:00:18.529 --> 01:00:20.296
Hey. Hey, hey.

01:00:27.638 --> 01:00:29.337
Okay. You're okay.

01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:30.474
We're here, okay?

01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:33.276
Where's Jesse?

01:00:43.587 --> 01:00:45.522
Marty.

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:49.658
Nate?

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.393
Nate?! No!

01:00:51.395 --> 01:00:52.661
No. Oh.

01:00:52.663 --> 01:00:54.463
Oh... oh, God.

01:00:55.966 --> 01:00:58.265
Oh. No.

01:01:15.486 --> 01:01:18.285
What the fuck?

01:01:18.287 --> 01:01:19.588
- Get out of here.
- Go.

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:21.456
Go. Go!

01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:22.524
I got her!

01:01:24.995 --> 01:01:28.295
Come on!

01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:42.844
You made your point.

01:01:42.846 --> 01:01:44.780
Marty, get back here.

01:01:44.782 --> 01:01:47.248
- I just called the police!
- Marty.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.717
They'll be here any second.

01:01:48.719 --> 01:01:52.253
Marty. Marty.

01:01:52.255 --> 01:01:55.358
If you leave now,
you can save yourself.

01:01:57.795 --> 01:01:59.260
Marty.

01:01:59.262 --> 01:02:00.731
Run!

01:02:07.638 --> 01:02:09.807
No! No! Come on!

01:03:16.807 --> 01:03:18.840
- Security.
- 911, attack at Hawthorne College.

01:03:18.842 --> 01:03:20.876
- What?
- Report's at 1974 Elm Road.

01:03:20.878 --> 01:03:23.411
I'm on my way.

01:03:45.803 --> 01:03:47.636
Get to the hall.

01:03:47.638 --> 01:03:49.437
Break for the door.

01:03:49.439 --> 01:03:50.874
As fast as you can, okay?

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:53.877
Okay.

01:04:25.576 --> 01:04:26.810
No!

01:04:50.434 --> 01:04:51.499
Freeze!

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:16.460
Why isn't it blood?

01:05:34.845 --> 01:05:37.712
I've seen him before.
He's a DKO pledge.

01:05:37.714 --> 01:05:39.581
Watch it, pledge.

01:05:39.583 --> 01:05:41.483
Break that, and it's all over.

01:05:41.485 --> 01:05:43.954
You'll never be
part of the Deke army.

01:05:48.959 --> 01:05:51.760
Riley, we have to go
to the cops.

01:05:51.762 --> 01:05:55.630
I'm gonna go get Nate's keys,
and you meet me by the door.

01:05:55.632 --> 01:05:57.766
Okay? Okay.

01:06:32.302 --> 01:06:34.504
This can't be real.

01:06:42.746 --> 01:06:44.079
Riley!

01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:49.117
Riley!

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:04.768
Get the keys!

01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:10.607
Go!

01:07:14.945 --> 01:07:17.145
- Uh, come on.
- Kris, open the door!

01:07:17.147 --> 01:07:19.647
I-I got it! Ah.

01:07:19.649 --> 01:07:22.117
Kris, hurry, hurry!

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:23.718
Come on, Kris!
Open the door!

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.687
I got it!

01:07:30.794 --> 01:07:32.027
Come on.

01:07:32.863 --> 01:07:35.663
Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

01:07:37.034 --> 01:07:38.666
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:07:38.668 --> 01:07:40.702
Hey, we're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

01:07:40.704 --> 01:07:41.736
Oh, God.

01:07:41.738 --> 01:07:43.138
Who the hell were those guys?

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.673
- Something crazy is going on.
- Yeah, no shit.

01:07:45.675 --> 01:07:47.742
A bunch of dudes
just tried to kill us.

01:07:47.744 --> 01:07:49.010
No, I mean
I saw that guy before,

01:07:49.012 --> 01:07:50.245
the night of the talent show.

01:07:50.247 --> 01:07:52.747
The Dekes were doing some sort
of ritual with the pledges.

01:07:52.749 --> 01:07:53.815
It's a frat.

01:07:53.817 --> 01:07:56.051
- Pledges pledge frats.
- No, this felt different.

01:07:56.053 --> 01:07:59.821
It was like they were doing
something with this black stuff

01:07:59.823 --> 01:08:01.890
that was coming out of
the founder's bust.

01:08:01.892 --> 01:08:03.158
It was like...

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.194
It was like black magic
or sorcery or something.

01:08:06.196 --> 01:08:08.229
So you're telling me
you think the DKO boys

01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:10.198
possessed their pledges
in some-some

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.966
supernatural hazing ritual?

01:08:11.968 --> 01:08:13.402
Well, you saw
the pledge's face.

01:08:13.404 --> 01:08:14.437
You saw his blood.

01:08:14.439 --> 01:08:17.238
I don't know what he was,
but he was changed.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.707
He wasn't human.

01:08:19.743 --> 01:08:21.410
Think about it.

01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:25.046
The bust gets brought into
the founder's fraternity.

01:08:25.048 --> 01:08:28.649
Brian Huntley turns up
to meet with the new pledges,

01:08:28.652 --> 01:08:32.187
and then we all start
getting these messages

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:35.223
from a Calvin Hawthorne
account.

01:08:35.225 --> 01:08:36.957
Lindsay goes missing.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.661
Helena goes missing.

01:08:39.662 --> 01:08:42.229
Marty and Jesse are dead.

01:08:42.232 --> 01:08:45.734
I mean, all of this
leads back to DKO.

01:08:47.737 --> 01:08:48.970
I need you to help me.

01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:50.839
I need you
to create a distraction

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:52.874
so that I can
sneak into the room

01:08:52.876 --> 01:08:55.844
where they were holding the
ceremony and get to the bust,

01:08:55.845 --> 01:08:58.212
because that is where
the power is coming from.

01:08:58.215 --> 01:08:59.981
Excuse me. What?

01:08:59.983 --> 01:09:02.850
A magical bust?
No. We're going to the cops.

01:09:02.853 --> 01:09:04.152
What are we gonna tell them?

01:09:04.154 --> 01:09:05.987
I would like to remind you

01:09:05.988 --> 01:09:09.023
that we just killed three
people who, possessed or not,

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:11.759
are lying dead
in our house right now.

01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:13.228
It was self-defense.

01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:15.765
Well, you want to count on
the cops believing that?

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.033
They didn't believe me

01:09:19.035 --> 01:09:22.069
when I told them
what Brian had done to me.

01:09:22.072 --> 01:09:25.142
So what makes you think that
they're gonna believe us now?

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.845
You don't even believe me.

01:09:33.484 --> 01:09:35.716
- Pull over.
- No.

01:09:35.719 --> 01:09:37.719
- Pull the car over, damn it!
- Shit, Riley!

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.987
Riley! What are you doing?!

01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:40.220
Jesus, Riley, stop!

01:09:40.223 --> 01:09:41.224
Stop! No!

01:09:48.231 --> 01:09:51.067
I thought that
you were a fighter.

01:10:20.297 --> 01:10:21.963
Riley?

01:10:21.965 --> 01:10:24.834
I was just on my way
to orphans' dinn...

01:10:26.236 --> 01:10:28.169
Whoa, what happened?

01:10:28.171 --> 01:10:29.170
Riley.

01:10:29.172 --> 01:10:31.107
Hey, Riley. What...

01:10:33.143 --> 01:10:34.976
Hey, c-can, can I help you?

01:10:34.978 --> 01:10:36.913
What-what do you need from me?

01:10:42.152 --> 01:10:45.155
Well, you really want to help?

01:11:05.409 --> 01:11:07.875
Let us in!

01:11:07.877 --> 01:11:10.044
- Is it happening to you, too?
- Yeah.

01:11:10.046 --> 01:11:12.048
And to Thetas, Pis and Kappas, too.

01:11:13.216 --> 01:11:15.885
We need to go to the cops, now.

01:11:17.388 --> 01:11:19.254
- Go.
- Go.

01:11:19.256 --> 01:11:21.324
Go, go, go!

01:11:54.891 --> 01:11:58.126
All right.
Uh, he's been Zeta'd.

01:11:58.128 --> 01:12:00.396
Uh, you've been Zeta'd.

01:12:00.398 --> 01:12:03.833
Yeah. You've been Zeta'd.

01:12:09.205 --> 01:12:11.074
Come on.

01:12:13.076 --> 01:12:14.210
Seriously?

01:12:16.079 --> 01:12:17.345
Hey!

01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:19.448
Not cool!

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:22.050
You ruined my mixer!

01:12:22.052 --> 01:12:24.486
Hey!

01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:26.187
Dickheads!

01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:28.424
Come get me,
you pieces of shit!

01:12:34.498 --> 01:12:36.966
Morons!

01:12:41.472 --> 01:12:43.039
Oh, hey, guys.

01:12:44.675 --> 01:12:46.375
How's it g...

01:12:48.379 --> 01:12:49.678
Oh, shit.

01:12:58.088 --> 01:12:59.688
What do you want, crease?

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:02.491
I want, um...

01:13:02.493 --> 01:13:04.258
I-I... I want you

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.431
to suck a fat fart
'cause you just got Zeta'd.

01:13:09.467 --> 01:13:12.100
I know for a fact
you're not in Zeta.

01:13:12.102 --> 01:13:14.135
But you can pledge our frat
if you want.

01:13:14.137 --> 01:13:17.205
Just got to go through a...
a little hazing ritual.

01:13:28.519 --> 01:13:30.952
Uh...

01:13:31.955 --> 01:13:33.555
Got a headache, bro?

01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:37.291
That's just the founder

01:13:37.293 --> 01:13:39.561
drawing out your true alpha.

01:13:59.517 --> 01:14:02.185
Help! Somebody help me, please!

01:14:06.322 --> 01:14:08.122
Help!

01:14:08.124 --> 01:14:09.926
Helena.

01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.463
- Oh, thank God you're here.
- You're alive.

01:14:14.465 --> 01:14:16.197
Yeah, we have to hurry, okay?
Okay. Okay.

01:14:16.199 --> 01:14:17.499
Someone could come back
at any second.

01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:19.501
- Did they hurt you?
- No, I think I'm okay.

01:14:19.503 --> 01:14:21.437
I'm okay.

01:14:21.439 --> 01:14:23.104
I thought no one would find me

01:14:23.106 --> 01:14:24.272
and I'd be
trapped here forever.

01:14:24.274 --> 01:14:26.410
You're okay now.
You're okay.

01:14:30.881 --> 01:14:33.049
Nice work, sweetie.

01:14:52.503 --> 01:14:55.504
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:14:55.506 --> 01:14:58.072
The spirit of the founder
compels you.

01:14:58.074 --> 01:15:01.075
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:02.413 --> 01:15:05.583
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:07.217 --> 01:15:08.216
Imagine a world

01:15:08.218 --> 01:15:10.819
where you're no longer
sitting in the corner.

01:15:10.821 --> 01:15:13.156
You're sitting on the throne.

01:15:21.432 --> 01:15:23.499
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:25.166
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:26.369 --> 01:15:28.204
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.608
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:31.509 --> 01:15:33.511
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:35.178 --> 01:15:37.412
<i>Fraternitas fratrum.</i>

01:15:52.095 --> 01:15:53.497
What's going on?

01:15:56.567 --> 01:15:58.467
What did you do to Landon?

01:15:58.469 --> 01:16:01.436
He is who he was always
meant to be: a fighter.

01:16:01.438 --> 01:16:02.871
A true man.

01:16:05.643 --> 01:16:08.644
You see, when your friend,
Miss Waterson,

01:16:08.646 --> 01:16:11.880
had the founder's statue
removed and brought here,

01:16:11.882 --> 01:16:16.284
the boys discovered something
magical hidden inside.

01:16:16.286 --> 01:16:18.687
Towards the end of his life,

01:16:18.689 --> 01:16:22.457
Hawthorne foresaw
the threat posed by women.

01:16:22.459 --> 01:16:23.892
So he took precautions

01:16:23.894 --> 01:16:25.694
in case they strayed
too far out of line.

01:16:25.696 --> 01:16:28.564
A master of the dark arts,

01:16:28.566 --> 01:16:32.233
he left instructions on how
to create an army of young men

01:16:32.235 --> 01:16:34.403
to take our power back.

01:16:36.205 --> 01:16:37.539
You're all insane.

01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:39.708
No, no.
Not insane, Miss Stone.

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:41.342
Simply men,

01:16:41.344 --> 01:16:44.211
tired of seeing ourselves
falsely accused,

01:16:44.213 --> 01:16:45.313
our livelihoods threatened,

01:16:45.315 --> 01:16:47.516
marginalized and belittled,

01:16:47.518 --> 01:16:50.320
reduced to spectators
in our own lives.

01:16:51.354 --> 01:16:52.621
Upon graduation,

01:16:52.623 --> 01:16:54.556
our army will
venture into courtrooms,

01:16:54.558 --> 01:16:56.725
boardrooms and
the halls of Congress

01:16:56.727 --> 01:16:58.594
to set the world right.

01:17:00.764 --> 01:17:03.230
It was really very simple.

01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:06.501
<i>A hazing ritual, if you will.</i>

01:17:06.503 --> 01:17:08.604
<i>We read the incantation
inside the bust,</i>

01:17:08.606 --> 01:17:11.740
<i>and the spirit of Calvin
Hawthorne filled the pledges,</i>

01:17:11.742 --> 01:17:13.375
<i>possessing them with</i>

01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:16.243
<i>supernatural strength
and drive.</i>

01:17:16.245 --> 01:17:18.212
All we had to do
was name the women

01:17:18.214 --> 01:17:19.414
who had stepped out of line,

01:17:19.416 --> 01:17:22.249
and these boys
took care of the rest.

01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:23.487
Be conscientious objectors
like Lindsay...

01:17:25.656 --> 01:17:27.522
...sign my petition against Professor Gelson?

01:17:28.358 --> 01:17:30.392
♪ Ho, ho, ho,
I didn't know... ♪

01:17:34.798 --> 01:17:38.232
Women who are
willing to be obedient,

01:17:38.234 --> 01:17:40.469
like your friend here,
will be spared.

01:17:40.471 --> 01:17:43.304
Those of you
who refuse to be compliant

01:17:43.306 --> 01:17:44.708
will face the consequences.

01:17:51.782 --> 01:17:55.719
Aren't you tired of fighting
against your true nature, Ri?

01:17:57.621 --> 01:18:00.455
Just because we're taking
our rightful place behind them

01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:03.425
doesn't mean
that we aren't needed.

01:18:03.427 --> 01:18:06.461
<i>They needed me
to collect the objects</i>

01:18:06.463 --> 01:18:08.697
<i>from the girls
so the pledges would know</i>

01:18:08.699 --> 01:18:10.297
who to go after.

01:18:10.299 --> 01:18:11.633
<i>I have a final in ten minutes,</i>

01:18:11.635 --> 01:18:13.404
and I can't find my DivaCup.

01:18:15.572 --> 01:18:17.306
Thanks for the comb,
by the way.

01:18:22.278 --> 01:18:26.381
How could you do that
to your sisters?

01:18:26.383 --> 01:18:28.450
I'm helping women.

01:18:28.452 --> 01:18:31.687
Everything is j...
so out of whack.

01:18:31.689 --> 01:18:34.355
It's so much easier this way.

01:18:34.357 --> 01:18:37.260
You are a traitor!

01:18:42.866 --> 01:18:44.866
This is your last chance, Ri.

01:18:44.868 --> 01:18:47.301
You can join me.

01:18:47.303 --> 01:18:49.440
We can be good women.

01:18:51.475 --> 01:18:52.339
Or...

01:18:52.341 --> 01:18:54.443
Or we will bring you
to your knees

01:18:54.445 --> 01:18:55.746
and you will beg for mercy.

01:18:57.548 --> 01:19:00.515
Still creating problems,
huh, Ri?

01:19:00.517 --> 01:19:02.050
You see, you were
given a chance.

01:19:02.052 --> 01:19:04.351
You were taught how to grow
into a proper woman,

01:19:04.353 --> 01:19:05.321
but you refused to listen.

01:19:09.358 --> 01:19:11.360
Now it's time to decide.

01:19:20.671 --> 01:19:24.441
Are you gonna bow to the king
when I say "bow"?

01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:30.246
Bow.

01:19:35.619 --> 01:19:37.353
I said bow, bitch.

01:19:41.725 --> 01:19:43.727
You need a reminder
of our power?

01:19:45.095 --> 01:19:46.797
Fine.

01:19:58.575 --> 01:20:00.276
Baby?

01:20:05.816 --> 01:20:06.884
Who put that there?

01:20:08.552 --> 01:20:10.552
It's for the cause.

01:20:10.554 --> 01:20:13.588
But I did everything
that I was supposed...

01:20:16.126 --> 01:20:19.828
He'll do worse than that to you.

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:21.865
Your body, your choice.

01:20:31.608 --> 01:20:33.608
I'll bow.

01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:36.478
I'll bow.
I'll be good.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.879
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

01:20:37.881 --> 01:20:39.714
You dragged my name
through the mud.

01:20:39.716 --> 01:20:42.918
You lied about what happened
and tried to destroy me.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.854
I told you guys I could
get her to do it. Huh?

01:20:45.856 --> 01:20:48.790
Who's the king?! Who's the king?!

01:20:48.792 --> 01:20:51.159
Who's the mighty king?!

01:20:51.161 --> 01:20:52.861
You took everything from me!

01:20:54.031 --> 01:20:56.865
And one day, someone will
tell everyone what you did,

01:20:56.867 --> 01:20:59.601
and people will believe her!

01:21:06.176 --> 01:21:08.344
See no evil, boys.

01:21:17.688 --> 01:21:19.888
You all right, bro?

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:21.892
Absolutely.

01:21:31.902 --> 01:21:34.905
You messed with
the wrong sisters.

01:23:20.077 --> 01:23:23.578
Wait! Wait. Wait.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.313
Don't you see?

01:23:25.315 --> 01:23:29.017
Woman is inextricably
tied to man.

01:23:29.019 --> 01:23:31.920
Break us, and you'll
only break yourselves.

01:23:33.857 --> 01:23:35.657
We will never be broken.

01:23:38.762 --> 01:23:40.797
No!

01:23:50.974 --> 01:23:52.943
Hey, Professor.

01:23:54.878 --> 01:23:57.014
Suck my...

01:24:32.115 --> 01:24:33.815
I'm so sorry!
You were right!

01:24:33.817 --> 01:24:35.183
I should've been fighting
this whole time.

01:24:35.185 --> 01:24:37.152
Now's not really the time
for I-told-you-so's,

01:24:37.154 --> 01:24:38.820
but I did tell you so.

01:24:40.057 --> 01:24:42.991
Help me! I've changed!

01:24:42.993 --> 01:24:44.826
I totally believe you!

01:24:44.828 --> 01:24:46.094
I can make this right!

01:24:46.096 --> 01:24:48.096
Bitch, you're gonna die!

01:24:48.098 --> 01:24:50.131
I'm so sorry, okay?
That wasn't me.

01:24:50.133 --> 01:24:52.100
- They did some magic shit.
- Not now!

01:24:52.102 --> 01:24:53.835
Sorry.

01:24:58.742 --> 01:24:59.741
Hurry!

01:25:01.044 --> 01:25:02.777
