WEBVTT

00:08.341 --> 00:09.408
- [sighs]
I'm having second thoughts

00:09.410 --> 00:11.510
About one
of the shirts I packed.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.246
The blue one
with the stripes.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.248
- I'm sure it's fine.
It's a blue shirt.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.717
- Well, yeah, but I'm wondering
if it's too blue.

00:18.719 --> 00:24.089
Like, am I making
a statement with the blueness?

00:24.091 --> 00:27.326
I am leaving early today
for philly,

00:27.328 --> 00:31.063
Because tomorrow is
the first day of my new job.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.365
So I figure
I'd get in at 5:00,

00:33.367 --> 00:36.101
Check into a hotel
at about 6:00

00:36.103 --> 00:37.703
So I can get
a real good night

00:37.705 --> 00:40.572
Of restless sleep
and nervous puking.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.307
- Uh, excuse me.
Trying to get work done.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.243
Some people don't care
about jim's new sports job

00:44.245 --> 00:46.111
In phila-whatever.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.614
- So you know my job
has something to do with sports,

00:48.616 --> 00:51.316
But you don't know the end
of the word "philadelphia"?

00:51.318 --> 00:52.684
- Philadelphia.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.720
From the greek <i>philia,</i>
<i>meaning "love,"</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:56.688
And <i>adelph,</i>
<i>meaning "adolf."</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:58.223
"the city
that loves adolf."

00:58.225 --> 01:00.259
Good luck
with your new enterprise.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.827
And don't wear
the blue striped shirt.

01:01.829 --> 01:05.364
It makes your neck
look like an old mop handle.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.134
- Oh...
Hey, guys,

01:09.136 --> 01:11.170
The christmas party
is today.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.771
Merry christmas,
everyone!

01:12.773 --> 01:14.306
- No.
- Is it?

01:14.308 --> 01:15.574
- I mean,
it says "x-mas party,"

01:15.576 --> 01:18.143
But I think we all know
what that's code for.

01:18.145 --> 01:20.279
- So we're not gonna have
a christmas party this year?

01:20.281 --> 01:22.247
Angela, how could you
do this to us?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.349
- Oh, right,
like I'm responsible

01:24.351 --> 01:26.185
'cause I'm in charge
of the party planning committee.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.187
- Well, you are
the one in charge of it.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.222
- Don't blame me
for something we all forgot.

01:30.224 --> 01:33.158
- Yeah, let's not blame her
for something we all forgot.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.228
I didn't realize how many of
angela's opinions I agreed with,

01:36.230 --> 01:38.263
Until she tried
to have my kneecap shattered

01:38.265 --> 01:39.498
For sleeping
with her husband.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.868
She makes a lot
of very sound points.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.303
- I knew
the party was today,

01:44.305 --> 01:46.338
But nobody asked me to plan it,
so I didn't.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.840
Hmm,
funny how that works.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.541
- [scoffs]
we're out there

01:49.543 --> 01:51.510
Sweating our balls off
every day,

01:51.512 --> 01:52.811
Bustin' our balls.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.480
We deserve
a christmas party!

01:54.482 --> 01:56.381
- Well, then, why don't we
just get some liquor

01:56.383 --> 01:59.751
And those mini-cupcakes?
- Mini-cupcakes?

01:59.753 --> 02:02.721
As in the mini version
of regular cupcakes,

02:02.723 --> 02:05.491
Which is already
a mini version of cake?

02:05.493 --> 02:08.193
Honestly, where does it end
with you people?

02:08.195 --> 02:10.629
- What about an authentic
pennsylvania dutch christmas?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.431
Drink some <i>gluhwein,</i>

02:12.433 --> 02:14.199
Enjoy some <i>hasenpfeffer.</i>

02:14.201 --> 02:16.668
Enjoy christmas
with saint nicolas'

02:16.670 --> 02:19.471
Rural german companion,
belsnickel.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.541
- Yes!
That, that, that!

02:22.543 --> 02:25.244
We're definitely doing that.
Are we all in agreement?

02:25.246 --> 02:26.278
- No.
- No!

02:26.280 --> 02:27.679
- Done, right?
- No.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.214
I want tropical christmas.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.850
- Topless christmas.
- Tapas swiss miss!

02:31.852 --> 02:35.220
Spanish tapas
and swiss miss hot cocoa--

02:35.222 --> 02:37.222
What's so hard
to understand?

02:37.224 --> 02:39.791
- Or, who was it
that suggested

02:39.793 --> 02:41.493
The authentic
pennsylvania dutch christmas?

02:41.495 --> 02:42.828
I think
it was someone really popular.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.630
- We already said no.
- No, no, no.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.898
- Too weird.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.366
- This is me
and my family

02:47.368 --> 02:48.567
Celebrating
pennsylvania dutch christmas

02:48.569 --> 02:50.402
In 1982
on the farm.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.337
There's me
and my brother jeb

02:52.339 --> 02:54.173
Breaking
the ceremonial pig rib.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.575
He doesn't come back
for christmas anymore.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.645
The sepia tint
is from an app on my phone.

02:59.647 --> 03:04.183
This is the same photo,
<i>matrix</i> style.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.450
- I'm not understanding
the confusion.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.818
Am I the only one
who wants to try

03:06.820 --> 03:09.388
Hufflepuffs
and schnauzerhosen,

03:09.390 --> 03:10.355
And meet
this glenpickle guy?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.623
[shrill whistle blows]

03:11.625 --> 03:13.926
- Party planning committee,
emergency meeting.

03:13.928 --> 03:17.563
Now.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.865
- I'm on it.
- Right.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.233
- I'm just hoping
german terrorists

03:21.235 --> 03:22.467
Don't take over
this christmas party.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.836
Make me go
all john mcclane on their asses.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.272
- Wait, german terrorists?
That's oddly specific.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.741
And I think--
I think you mean john mccain.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.543
- <i>Die hard</i> reference.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.979
- I haven't seen it.
- You haven't seen <i>die hard?</i>

03:33.981 --> 03:36.348
- Mm-mmm.
Why haven't you seen <i>die hard?</i>

03:36.350 --> 03:38.383
- I don't know,
I just haven't.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.552
- Come on, you had to have
at least seen some of it.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.587
- No.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.823
- "now, I have
a machine gun.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.792
Ho, ho, ho."

03:46.794 --> 03:48.327
- [as bruce willis]
"come out to the coast,

03:48.329 --> 03:50.295
We'll get together,
have a few laughs."

03:50.297 --> 03:52.564
- None of this
makes any sense to me!

03:52.566 --> 03:55.267
- Oh, yeah, and when he takes
the gun off his back,

03:55.269 --> 03:57.636
And he's like,
"yippie-ki-yay, mother--"

03:57.638 --> 03:59.771
- Actually,
he doesn't say that there.

03:59.773 --> 04:04.376
He says it earlier when
he's on the radio with hans.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.778
- Yes, you are right.
Forgive me.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.880
- Oh, that's okay, bud.
- Nope.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.716
- Common mistake.
- No, it's not.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.351
- Nerd!

04:12.353 --> 04:14.453
Do you know
every line of the movie?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.021
- My brother dared me
to memorize it,

04:16.023 --> 04:19.258
And I did it,
and I loved doing it.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.326
- Okay, let's hear it.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.428
- Hear what?
- <i>Die hard.</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:25.797
Every line.
Go.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.266
- You don't like flying,
do you?

04:27.268 --> 04:29.368
- Don't change
the subject.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.702
- No, that's the--

04:30.704 --> 04:32.304
- Movie is starting.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.639
- We're thinking
of collaborating

04:33.641 --> 04:35.474
With mike schmidt
on some of his charity work.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.010
- I love philly.
Dirty town.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.912
- Ah-ha-ha!
Philly!

04:40.914 --> 04:44.316
Exciting stuff, man.
- Whoo!

04:44.318 --> 04:46.451
- So you sure you remembered
everything for your trip?

04:46.453 --> 04:50.422
- Yeah, I think so.
- Think that through for a sec.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.057
Yeah, jim's going
to philly tomorrow.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.525
He said he was gonna
take me with him,

04:53.527 --> 04:54.993
But that
was two months ago.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.562
And I haven't heard
anything since.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.699
I mean,
he said that, right?

05:00.701 --> 05:03.402
What else could you possibly
be forgetting?

05:03.404 --> 05:06.405
- Uh--
- things? People?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.706
- [chuckles nervously]

05:07.708 --> 05:09.608
- You know who's not
gonna get to work

05:09.610 --> 05:11.410
On some exciting
new startup this year?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.478
George howard skub,

05:13.480 --> 05:16.448
A.K.A. The alleged
scranton strangler,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.417
Because he's in prison

05:18.419 --> 05:20.352
For something
he may not have done.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.055
- I'm sorry, the--
uh, the scranton who?

05:23.057 --> 05:25.724
- The scranton strangler.
George howard skub.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.025
Haven't I told you
about the jury

05:27.027 --> 05:28.360
I was on
a couple years ago?

05:28.362 --> 05:30.462
- [gasps]
oh, what happened?

05:30.464 --> 05:31.963
I mean, if you can
talk about it, obviously.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.365
Because if you can't,
I mean, I understand.

05:33.367 --> 05:37.102
- I--I could--
I could talk about it.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.537
- See you
next christmas.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.838
- I could, sure.
Have a seat.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.573
I would start
at the beginning,

05:41.575 --> 05:45.644
But I think I need
to go farther back.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.746
- We're the party
planning committee,

05:47.748 --> 05:49.448
And we did not get
where we are

05:49.450 --> 05:50.916
By playing it safe.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.851
We got here
by being risk takers.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.120
And, yeah,

05:55.122 --> 05:57.989
Dwight's party
is gonna be terrible.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.792
Maybe.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.396
Maybe it's not.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.131
Maybe it's going to be great.

06:06.133 --> 06:11.670
And, if it's great...

06:11.672 --> 06:13.138
I think we all know

06:13.140 --> 06:17.442
What that would mean
to us.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.111
- Let's do it.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.146
- Yes.
Phyllis!

06:21.148 --> 06:24.116
I don't want my name
attached to this party.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.117
- What does that even mean?

06:25.119 --> 06:26.451
Where would
your name appear?

06:26.453 --> 06:27.486
- Please just take my name

06:27.488 --> 06:31.757
- Just take her name
off of everything.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.158
- [clears throat]

06:33.160 --> 06:35.927
The party planning committee,
minus angela,

06:35.929 --> 06:41.500
Has decided that we're all going
to do dwight's christmas.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.001
- Yes!
Yeah!

06:43.003 --> 06:45.036
Yeah!
Okay!

06:45.038 --> 06:47.506
Yes!
It's a christmas miracle!

06:47.508 --> 06:48.974
Yeah!

06:48.976 --> 06:51.143
Whoo-hoo!
- Dwight, there is one rule

06:51.145 --> 06:53.178
That you need
to take very seriously.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.080
- Uh-huh.
- And that is...

06:55.082 --> 06:56.415
- Uh-oh.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.649
- That there are no rules.

06:57.651 --> 07:01.520
- You have never been cooler.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.422
Best christmas ever.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.689
- You're welcome.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.758
- Thank you.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.430
- [playing horn]

07:11.432 --> 07:15.667
And pennsylvania dutch christmas
has officially begun.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.503
- Ugh.
What is this stuff, lava?

07:18.505 --> 07:21.473
- That is <i>gluhwein,</i>
<i>otherwise known as glow-wine,</i>

07:21.475 --> 07:23.442
Also used to sterilize
medical instruments.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.178
And, interesting factoid,

07:26.180 --> 07:28.780
This is the very spoon
that guided my soft skull

07:28.782 --> 07:31.149
Through the birth canal
when I was born.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.084
Enjoy.
- What is it?

07:33.086 --> 07:35.220
Don't touch it.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.123
- Somebody's found the hog maw.
- Oh!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.191
- What?

07:39.193 --> 07:40.592
It's a pennsylvania
dutch specialty.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.194
Hog maw.
That's a beauty, isn't it?

07:42.196 --> 07:44.229
I don't even want
to tell you what it's made of

07:44.231 --> 07:45.764
Until after you try it.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.866
- Ugh.
I'm not eating mystery meat.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.568
- It is stuffed pig stomach.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.037
And, after we finish it,
we get to break the pig rib.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.205
- Can't wait.
- Weird.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.006
Where are the sugar cookies?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.708
Where's
the karaoke machine?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.510
- This is austere, meredith.

07:58.512 --> 08:02.547
This is celebrating christmas
for all of the right reasons.

08:02.549 --> 08:06.184
The cookies and toys and sweets
are mere distractions.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.119
I mean, most people
don't even know

08:08.121 --> 08:10.722
That a candy cane
represents a shepherd's crook,

08:10.724 --> 08:13.191
Which I assure you
does not taste like peppermint.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.659
It tastes
like sheep feces.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.061
- How would anyone even know--

08:16.063 --> 08:17.496
- Have you ever tasted
a shepherd's crook?

08:17.498 --> 08:19.264
- I don't know.
Is it what you expected?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.734
- I feel like--
dwight is holding a candle

08:22.736 --> 08:25.203
And reading a poem.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.940
- So happy right now.

08:28.942 --> 08:33.178
- [speaking german]

08:33.180 --> 08:34.746
Wait, what is that I hear?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.181
Is someone on the roof?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.083
How strange.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.986

18:49.162 --> 18:50.461
- Dwight, want me
to get you some eggnog?

18:50.463 --> 18:53.197
- No, thanks. I'll just have
another dumatril.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.867
Jim taught me
this really cool way to take it.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.669
You crush it into a powder,
and you snort it up your butt.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.138
- Yep, I did say that.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.206
- Jim!
- What's going on?

19:02.208 --> 19:03.441
Where's the belsnickel?

19:03.443 --> 19:04.509
- Oh--

19:04.511 --> 19:07.912
Oh, my god!

19:07.914 --> 19:10.181
- What are you doing?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.883
Last time I saw you, you were
whipping me out of the building.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.185
- Shh.
Let's not speak of that.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.887
The pig rib.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.688
We could totally break
the pig rib!

19:17.690 --> 19:20.725
I'm gonna dig it out
of the trash.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.494
- What happened?
Did you miss your bus?

19:23.496 --> 19:26.164
- No. I just missed
my wife.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.866
- I found it!

19:28.868 --> 19:30.735
And I found out

19:30.737 --> 19:32.203
That there's a bus
at 5:00 a.M.

19:32.205 --> 19:36.607
[all cheering
and chanting]

19:42.181 --> 19:43.214
- Oh!

19:43.216 --> 19:46.250
[all groan]

19:46.252 --> 19:48.386
- Damn it!

19:48.388 --> 19:51.822
Jim got the bigger half.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.191
- Back for more, huh?

19:53.193 --> 19:56.861
- Ooh, nog it.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.897
[indistinct chatter]

19:59.899 --> 20:02.833
- Thanks, phyllis.
Where's andy?

20:02.835 --> 20:05.970
- You!
- Oh, hey, man.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.405
Oh, you know what?
Before I forget again,

20:07.407 --> 20:09.340
I talked to the guys
about hiring you.

20:09.342 --> 20:13.511
They're gonna bring you in
for an interview.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.550
- That's great.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.985
- Right?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.955
- Thanks, man.
- Hey, of course.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.991
- I shall come by
at your convenience.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.492
- Thank you, sir.

20:28.494 --> 20:30.528
- Whoo!
- Go get 'em.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.730
- Oh! Whoa!
[alarmed shouts]

20:34.433 --> 20:37.635
[alarmed shouts]

20:37.637 --> 20:39.637
- Very impish.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.014
- Two dimes, seven nickels--
well, okay,

20:50.016 --> 20:51.315
No, that doesn't add up.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.785
It was one quarter and--
- shh.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.820
- What?
I was just explaining--

20:55.822 --> 20:57.822
- Shh.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.323
- Why wouldn't it--
- shh.

20:59.325 --> 21:05.029
- But why?
- No...More...Talking.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.632
- Are you gonna kiss me?

21:07.634 --> 21:12.436
- Yes.
