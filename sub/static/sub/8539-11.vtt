YOU SAID YOU HAD INFORMATION
ABOUT RED JOHN.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.013
YES, I DO.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.582
HE KILLED YOUR WIFE
AND DAUGHTER, HUH?

01:44.669 --> 01:47.063
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.

01:47.150 --> 01:50.284
THEY SAY YOU CAN TELL
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LYING.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.677
DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION
ABOUT RED JOHN?

01:52.764 --> 01:56.377
I HAVE DYNAMITE INFORMATION
ABOUT RED JOHN.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.206
ENOUGH TO CATCH HIM.HOW DO YOU COME
BY THIS INFORMATION?

01:59.293 --> 02:03.732
RED JOHN IS A FRIEND
OF A FRIEND OF MINE.IS THAT FRIEND OF YOURS
IN PRISON, TOO?

02:03.819 --> 02:08.824
[chuckles] I HAVE FRIENDS
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.

02:08.911 --> 02:09.999
TELL ME.

02:13.089 --> 02:16.745
I AM CURRENTLY DOING
25 YEARS TO LIFE
FOR A CRIME I DIDN'T COMMIT.

02:16.832 --> 02:19.617
MY LAST APPEAL JUST FAILED.

02:19.704 --> 02:23.621
YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE,
AND I WILL GIVE YOU RED JOHN.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.972
YOU RAPED AND MURDERED YOUR
FAMILY HOUSEKEEPER'S DAUGHTER.

02:27.059 --> 02:31.063
IF YOU DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ME,
YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT A REAL
MAGICIAN.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.328
I DIDN'T DO IT.I READ THE CASE FILE--

02:34.415 --> 02:36.895
THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,
THE TESTIMONIES
OF ALL THE WITNESSES,

02:36.982 --> 02:38.723
INCLUDING YOUR OWN FAMILY,
SAYS YOU DID.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.464
I DIDN'T KILL HER.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.379
WHAT HAPPENED?I DON'T KNOW.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.775
WE WERE PARTYING.

02:46.862 --> 02:52.084
I DID SOME BLOW, SOME METH.
WE HAD SEX. I FELL ASLEEP.

02:58.439 --> 03:01.485
THERE WERE BARS
ON THE WINDOWS.YES.

03:01.572 --> 03:05.097
HOW IS IT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE
THAT ANYONE ELSE COULD'VE
COMMITTED THE MURDER?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.578
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.580
ERGO, SOMEONE ELSE DID.

EVEN IF YOU ARE INNOCENT,
IT DOESN'T MEAN

03:25.596 --> 03:27.119
YOU HAVE INFORMATION
ON RED JOHN.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.645
YEAH, IT'S A TOUGH CALL.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.740
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NO.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.136

RED JOHN PAINTED HER TOENAILS.

03:44.224 --> 03:48.358
YES. PAINTED THEM
WITH HER OWN BLOOD...

03:48.445 --> 03:50.534
THE POLICE DIDN'T
MAKE THAT PUBLIC, DID THEY?

03:50.621 --> 03:54.059

FOR YOU ALONE.

04:01.676 --> 04:04.156

OF A FRIEND OF MINE.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.249

04:09.336 --> 04:12.948
HIS NAME IS "GET ME OUT OF HERE

HELP YOU.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.194
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.197
IT'S JUST--IT'S NOT
PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.330
JARED RENFREW
WAS TRIED AND CONVICTED.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.898
IT'S A CLOSED CASE.
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY

04:49.985 --> 04:52.292
TO REOPEN IT WITHOUT CAUSE.THERE IS CAUSE.

ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

YOU SAID YOU KNOW
WHO REALLY DID IT.NO, I JUST--

08:06.050 --> 08:08.183

TO GET INSIDE THE HOUSE.

08:08.270 --> 08:10.228
I'VE NO IDEA
WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.927
IT MIGHT'VE BEEN JARED.
UM, I HOPE NOT.

THE TRUTH. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:16.104 --> 08:18.976
I THINK YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE
RIGHT NOW, MR. JANE.

08:19.063 --> 08:22.502
I DON'T HAVE THE--THE TIME
OR THE PATIENCE FOR TOMFOOLERY.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.722
SO YOU THINK HE'S GUILTY?
I'M WASTING MY TIME.WE'RE DONE TALKING.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.508
SUPPOSE I COULD PROVE
HE WAS INNOCENT.
WOULDN'T YOU WANT THAT?

08:28.595 --> 08:31.859
WOULDN'T YOU WANT THAT BLOT
ON YOUR NAME EXPUNGED?OF COURSE HE WOULD.

08:31.946 --> 08:35.689
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER,
BUT MY BROTHER'S GUILTY.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.169

HE VIOLATED THIS HOUSE.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.433

TO KNOW.

YOU LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.399
WELL, THAT'S NOT YOUR CALL
TO MAKE, IS IT?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.488
BRECK, CALL THE POLICE.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.534

I'M UNARMED.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.935

GO INSIDE!

09:07.285 --> 09:10.506
MY NAME'S PATRICK JANE.
I WANNA SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR SON JARED.

09:10.593 --> 09:13.030
I'LL DEAL WITH HIM.
THE POLICE ARE COMING.
GO INSIDE.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.903
DON'T ORDER ME ABOUT,
AND DON'T BE SO HYSTERICAL.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.384
WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST
IN JARED?

09:19.471 --> 09:21.952
I'M A FRIEND OF HIS,
TRYING TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.002
COME AND SIT DOWN.THANK YOU.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.570
MOTHER,
YOU'RE BEING CHILDISH.GO AWAY, GARDNER.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.615
MOTHER!GO AWAY!

09:37.664 --> 09:40.144
TELL ME WHY YOU WISH
TO PROVE MY SON'S INNOCENCE.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.539
OH, I CAN PROMISE YOU
I'M NOT UP TO ANYTHING
SINISTER, MA'AM.

09:43.626 --> 09:44.584
MY MOTIVES ARE PURE.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.935
TELL ME ABOUT JARED.

09:48.022 --> 09:50.938
HE WAS A TROUBLED CHILD,
CHARMING AND BRIGHT,

09:51.025 --> 09:53.288
BUT A BULLY AND A LIAR.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.942
SOMETHING OF A SADIST.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.031
QUALITIES YOU RATHER LIKED
IN HIM, I EXPECT.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.382
[chuckles] YES, I DID.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.515
I FOUND HIM RATHER AMUSING...
AT FIRST.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.517
ONE DOESN'T WANT A WIMP
FOR A SON.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.302
[chuckles]

10:07.389 --> 10:11.393
BUT THERE MUST BE A SENSE
OF PROPORTION AND MODERATION.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.875
AS HE GOT OLDER, HE GOT WORSE.
GOT IN WITH BAD PEOPLE.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.660
IT WAS ONE SCANDAL
AFTER ANOTHER.
IN AND OUT OF PRISON.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.184
A COMMON CRIMINAL.BUT HE TURNED HIMSELF
AROUND, DIDN'T HE?

10:20.271 --> 10:24.188
HE GAVE UP THE DRINK
AND THE DRUGS
AND THE GALLIVANTING,

10:24.275 --> 10:27.714
MADE PEACE WITH HIS BROTHER
AND CAME HOME TO HELP RUN
THE FAMILY BUSINESSES.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.585
THE PRODIGAL SON.YES.

10:31.195 --> 10:35.025
GEORGE, HIS FATHER,
WAS OVERJOYED.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.461
I WAS SKEPTICAL.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.507
PLEASED, OF COURSE,
BUT SKEPTICAL.

10:38.594 --> 10:41.031
AS MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID,
"YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE."

10:41.118 --> 10:42.685
I GUESS SHE'S RIGHT.YES.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.647
POOR GEORGE DROPPED DEAD
A WEEK AFTER THE MURDER.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.344
BROKE HIS HEART,
PEOPLE SAID.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.608
GEORGE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
A HEART, IN THAT SENSE.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.436
HE DIED OF EMBARRASSMENT.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.917
A RENFREW IN THE POKEY
FOR MURDER.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.527
QUELLE HORREUR.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.572
CAN YOU SHOW ME
WHERE IT HAPPENED?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.400
WHO ELSE WAS
IN THE HOUSE?

11:02.487 --> 11:04.402
I HAD A SMALL DINNER PARTY,

11:04.489 --> 11:06.927
PROBABLY TEN PEOPLE
ALL TOLD.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.712
AFTER THEY LEFT,
IT WAS JUST FAMILY--

11:09.799 --> 11:12.280
GARDNER AND BRECK,
GEORGE AND I

11:12.367 --> 11:15.109
AND JARED, OF COURSE.NOT MARISKA THE HOUSEKEEPER?

11:15.196 --> 11:16.806
NO, SHE LIVED OUT.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.942
[sighs] UNDINE WAS ONLY HERE
TO HELP THE COOK

11:22.029 --> 11:23.683
WITH THE DINNER PARTY.OH.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.426
SHE WAS A LOVELY GIRL,

11:28.513 --> 11:31.778
FULL OF LIFE AND PROMISE.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.519
HER MOTHER AND MARISKA
HAD BEEN WITH US 20 YEARS...

11:34.606 --> 11:36.173
PART OF THE FAMILY.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.654
JARED TOLD ME THAT
THEY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR,

11:38.741 --> 11:40.961
THAT HE LOVED HER
AND HE'D NEVER HURT HER.

11:41.048 --> 11:44.834
SHE TOLD HER MOTHER
THAT HE WAS STALKING HER,
THAT SHE WAS SCARED OF HIM.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.968
SHE DIDN'T GO TO THE POLICE
OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE FAMILY.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.752
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO HER MOTHER.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.841
SHE LEFT OUR EMPLOY,
I'M AFRAID.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.757
IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT,
FOR BOTH OF US.

11:54.844 --> 11:55.889
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

11:55.976 --> 11:57.847
I HAVE AN ADDRESS
SOMEWHERE.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.897
CAN YOU GET IT
FOR ME NOW?

12:03.984 --> 12:05.202
AS YOU WISH.

12:05.289 --> 12:06.682
THANK YOU.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.280
SIR, WOULD YOU COME
WITH US?WHY?

12:39.367 --> 12:40.977
YOU'RE TRESPASSING HERE.NO, I'M NOT.

12:41.064 --> 12:43.545
OKAY, SIR, THIS MAN HERE
SAYS HE'S THE HOMEOWNER

12:43.632 --> 12:46.243
AND SAYS YOU'RE TRESPASSING,
SO LET'S GO, PARTNER.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.810
OFFICER,
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.899
I'M THE HOMEOWNER.
THAT MAN IS THE INTRUDER.

12:49.986 --> 12:52.554
WELL, THAT'S A LIE!
HE--HE'S LYING!

12:52.641 --> 12:54.382
LISTEN TO THE MADNESS
IN HIS VOICE.

12:54.469 --> 12:57.167
WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE HIM
SOMEWHERE HE CAN GET SOME HELP?

12:57.254 --> 13:00.257
DON'T KNOW THAT
SHE'LL STILL BE THERE, BUT...THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.433
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, GARDNER.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.567
POLICEMEN? HOW RIDICULOUS.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.482
SEND THEM AWAY.MA'AM, THIS MAN HERE--

13:07.569 --> 13:09.789
YES, YES,
IT'S QUITE ALRIGHT, OFFICER.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.225
YOU CAN GO.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
[Gardner] THANKS.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.755
WELL, GOOD-BYE,
MRS. RENFREW.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.888
I EXPECT
WE'LL SPEAK AGAIN SOON.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.238
GOOD DAY TO YOU.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.588
[Minelli] GARDNER RENFREW
IS A PLAYER IN THIS TOWN.

13:26.675 --> 13:30.897
YOU CAN'T GO TO HIS HOUSE
AND SCREW AROUND WITH HIM.WHY NOT?
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

13:30.984 --> 13:34.726
I DIDN'T USE MY I.D.
OR MENTION THE CBI.YOU GAVE YOUR REAL NAME.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.642
IT'S MY NAME.YOU SHOULD'VE LIED
AS YOU SO OFTEN DO,

13:37.729 --> 13:39.427
BECAUSE NOW I'VE TO
OFFICIALLY REPRIMAND YOU,

13:39.514 --> 13:41.429
ORDER YOU
IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS

13:41.516 --> 13:43.213
TO LEAVE
THE RENFREW FAMILY ALONE

13:43.300 --> 13:45.215
AND--AND DROP THE MATTER.SORRY, CAN'T DO THAT.

13:45.302 --> 13:48.436
YOU HAVE TO. THIS IS
STRAIGHT FROM THE A.G.'s OFFICE.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.003
JARED RENFREW
DIDN'T KILL UNDINE KOPECKI.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.005
DO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE?NOT YET.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.485
I HAVE PIECES...
THAT I'M PIECING TOGETHER.[Minelli sighs]

13:54.572 --> 13:56.574
HE'S INNOCENT.

13:56.661 --> 13:59.012
WAKE UP, DOROTHY.
YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.536
THERE ARE INNOCENT MEN IN JAIL.
IT HAPPENS.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.321
IS HE ONE OF THEM?
I DON'T KNOW. I DOUBT IT.

14:04.408 --> 14:07.150
IN ANY CASE,
WE CAN'T REOPEN HIS CASE.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.500
IF I'M DOROTHY,
THEN WHO ARE YOU?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.764
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO I AM.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.377
WE WILL FIND OTHER WAYS
OF MAKING RENFREW TALK TO YOU.

14:16.464 --> 14:20.294
THERE IS A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE
TO MAKE A PRISONER'S LIFE EASIER

14:20.381 --> 14:22.644
IF HE COOPERATES.IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
HE'S INNOCENT.

14:22.731 --> 14:25.473
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.040
IF YOU PURSUE THIS ANY FURTHER,

14:27.127 --> 14:29.694
I'M GONNA HAVE TO THROW YOU OUT
OF THE CBI.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.567
WE CAN'T TAKE THE LIABILITY.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.091
I VERY MUCH DO NOT WANNA
HAVE TO DO THAT.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.313
[clears throat]

14:43.839 --> 14:46.102
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.670
SO, UH...

14:48.757 --> 14:50.367
WELL, I'LL SPARE YOU
THE TROUBLE.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.239
I QUIT.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.372
DON'T DO THAT.OH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S BEST THIS WAY.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.245
YOU ARE THE GOOD WITCH GLINDA,
OBVIOUSLY.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.205
THANK YOU.

15:04.425 --> 15:05.905
I LEARNED A LOT.

15:23.879 --> 15:27.143
DON'T BOTHER, I KNOW.
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.
NOTHING TO BE DONE.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.406
WHEN HE NEEDS OUR HELP,
WE'RE LETTING HIM DOWN.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.713
I WANNA HELP HIM
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.846
OUR ORDERS STATE THAT WE
MUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.458
I DON'T CARE
WHAT OUR ORDERS SAY.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.635
WE CLOSED CASE BEFORE HE CAME.
WE'LL CLOSE CASES AFTER HE'S
GONE.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.943
YEAH, JUST NOT SO MANY.THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
HE NEEDS US.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
YEAH, HE NEEDS US
ON A FOOL'S ERRAND.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.860
RENFREW'S A CON MAN. HE DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RED JOHN.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.602
SUPPOSE WE FOUND A CONNECTION
BETWEEN RENFREW AND RED JOHN.

15:51.689 --> 15:55.955
IT WOULD--WAIT.
WHAT'S IN THE FILE?

15:56.042 --> 15:59.349
LET ME GUESS--A CONNECTION
BETWEEN RENFREW AND RED JOHN?

15:59.436 --> 16:00.916
SEVEN YEARS AGO,

16:01.003 --> 16:03.658
RENFREW WAS SERVING TIME
ON A NARCOTICS CONVICTION.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.181
HE SHARED A CELL IN LOMPOC

16:05.268 --> 16:07.488
WITH A MAN BY THE NAME
OF ORVAL TANNER.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.794
TANNER CLAIMED
IN HIS 1998 TRIAL FOR MURDER

16:09.881 --> 16:11.883
THAT HE HAD ONLY BEEN
AN ACCOMPLICE,

16:11.971 --> 16:15.931
THAT THE REAL KILLER WAS A MAN
BY THE NAME OF RED JOHN.
NOBODY BELIEVED HIM.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.760
'98. THAT'S THE BEGINNING
OF RED JOHN'S CAREER.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.806
WHERE'S TANNER NOW?HE DIED OF HEART DISEASE
IN A PRISON HOSPITAL.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.113
OF COURSE, OUR LUCK.IT'S A CONNECTION.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.029
SLIM. LIKELY, NOBODY
BELIEVED HIM FOR A REASON.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.465
BUT IT'S A CONNECTION.

16:31.729 --> 16:34.036
OKAY.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.560
CHECK OUT TANNER'S BACKGROUND,
FIND THE AUTOPSY REPORTS,

16:36.647 --> 16:39.911
SEE IF THERE'S ANYCREDIBILITY
TO HIS STORY.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.088
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
WE CAN'T DO THAT,

16:42.175 --> 16:44.525
BUT THAT'S
WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU TO DO

16:44.612 --> 16:47.528
IF WE WEREN'T ORDERED
TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE.

16:50.748 --> 16:55.101
OKAY, THEN LET ME SPEAK
TO THE ASSISTANT
TO THE DEPUTY RECORDS OFFICER.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.712
WHY DO PEOPLE SAY "EUREKA"
WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING GOOD?

16:57.799 --> 16:59.366
IT'S, UH, GREEK FOR "BINGO."

17:01.237 --> 17:03.587
WELL, SO... EUREKA.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.980
I FOUND THE AUTOPSY REPORTS,

17:05.067 --> 17:07.548
AND THEY BACK UP
ORVAL TANNER'S STORY.

17:07.635 --> 17:10.333
THE BODY OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM--
CUT UP, RED JOHN STYLE.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.335
WHICH MEANS RENFREW'S TELLING
SOME KIND OF TRUTH

17:12.422 --> 17:14.468
ABOUT HIS RED JOHN
CONNECTION.YEP.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.086
VAN PELT. WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE WORKING ON?

17:24.173 --> 17:26.697
SIR, I ASKED HER TO--I'M TALKING TO VAN PELT.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.789
SIR...

17:31.876 --> 17:34.009
I'M DOING RESEARCH FOR JANE.
NO EXCUSES, SIR.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.491
YOU, TOO, I SUPPOSE.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.366
HEY, BOSS.I GAVE THIS UNIT
A DIRECT, WRITTEN ORDER,

17:43.453 --> 17:45.499
AND THEY HAVE FLAGRANTLY
DISOBEYED THAT ORDER.

17:45.586 --> 17:48.023
DID THEY DO THAT
WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE?

17:48.110 --> 17:49.720
I ORDERED THEM TO DO IT.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.332
I TOLD THEM YOU COUNTERMANDED
YOUR EARLIER ORDER.

17:52.419 --> 17:55.944
THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE WHATSOEVER
THAT THEY WERE DOING ANYTHING
IRREGULAR.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.338
NICE TRY, MOTHER TERESA.
THEY ALREADY GAVE THEMSELVES UP.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.730
WE NEVER SAID A WORD--

18:01.863 --> 18:03.821
I STAND BY MY STORY.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.041
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE OUT OF LINE.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.088
SIR, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.
WE FORCED AGENT LISBON
TO DO THIS.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.307
VERY TOUCHING.

18:11.394 --> 18:13.657
MY EX-WIFE WOULD LOVE
THIS SCENE IN A MOVIE.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.834
I'M GIVING YOU ALL
FORMAL NOTICE.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.445
ANY FURTHER INFRACTIONS

18:18.532 --> 18:20.882
WILL RESULT
IN IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.624
SIR, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
SUSPEND ME NOW,

18:23.711 --> 18:25.887
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE
FURTHER INFRACTIONS.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.194
JANE NEEDS OUR HELP,
AND HE'S GONNA GET IT.

18:28.281 --> 18:31.371
I'M NOT LAYING OFF
BECAUSE SOME FAT CAT'S
PUTTING ON THE PRESSURE.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.546
ME, TOO.ME, TOO.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.722
AND ME.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.027
[sighs]

18:36.115 --> 18:38.465
MOVING, ELOQUENT,
TWO THUMBS UP.

18:41.816 --> 18:45.211
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH.
YOU'RE ALL SUSPENDED,

18:45.298 --> 18:46.777
STARTING RIGHT NOW,

18:46.864 --> 18:48.388
FOR GROSS INSUBORDINATION.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.437
I'M SORRY.

18:56.396 --> 18:57.745
[sighs]

19:01.705 --> 19:03.664
OH, HI. LISBON.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.056
STILL HERE?

19:05.144 --> 19:08.364
UH, THAT WAS MORE
OF A RHETORICAL STAND

19:08.451 --> 19:10.888
WE WERE TAKING BACK THERE.YOU TAKE IT BACK THEN.

19:10.975 --> 19:14.892
WELL, NO,
BUT I WANTED TO TALK TO--THIS--THE, UM,

19:14.979 --> 19:18.113
THE SUSPENSION PAPERWORK
RIGHT HERE.LOOK--

19:18.200 --> 19:22.204
I HAVE TO GO AND VISIT
MY SISTER IN HAWAII FOR A WEEK.
SHE'S SICK.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.947
MEANWHILE, THIS PAPERWORK
IS GONNA SIT ON MY DESK

19:26.034 --> 19:29.037
FOR A WEEK,
IS THAT CLEAR?

19:29.124 --> 19:30.647
ONE WEEK.YES, SIR.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.083
YES.THANK YOU.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.521
BE VERY GRATEFUL.

19:34.608 --> 19:37.480
DO NOT CONTACT ME.
I DO NOT WANNA KNOW ANYTHING.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.570
AND PLEASE DO NOT DIG THE HOLE
THAT YOU ARE STANDING IN

19:40.657 --> 19:43.094
ANY DEEPER
THAN YOU HAVE ALREADY DUG IT.NO, SIR.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.793
THAT HOLE IS THE GRAVE
OF YOUR VERY PROMISING CAREER.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.884
YOU SHOULD PUT A FLASHLIGHT
UNDERNEATH YOUR CHIN

19:49.971 --> 19:51.886
JUST TO COMPLETE THE EFFECT.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.931
I'M NOT KIDDING.I KNOW.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.653
[cell phone ringing]

20:26.355 --> 20:27.356
HEY, LISBON.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.620
OH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.361
UH, JUST, UH...

20:32.448 --> 20:34.233
OUT INVESTIGATING STUFF.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.759
UH... SURE.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.328
YEAH, UH...

20:42.415 --> 20:43.981
PEPPERONI OR PLAIN?

20:45.853 --> 20:48.464
OKAY.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.814
UH, HEY, LISBON...

20:50.901 --> 20:52.729
UM...

20:52.816 --> 20:54.601
THANK YOU.

20:54.688 --> 20:58.082
RENFREW COULDN'T DISPUTE
THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

20:58.169 --> 21:00.955
THE CORE OF HIS DEFENSE
WAS THAT HE LOVED UNDINE DEEPLY

21:01.042 --> 21:02.696
AND HE WOULD NEVER HURT HER.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.133
UNDINE'S MOTHER TESTIFIED
THAT WAS A LIE.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.657
I WENT TO GO SPEAK WITH HER,
BUT SHE MOVED,

21:07.744 --> 21:09.659
LEFT NO FORWARDING ADDRESS.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.879
MARISKA KOPECKI, RIGHT?YEAH.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.185
HOW DOES THE BROTHER LOOK?HE HAD MOTIVE.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.014
THERE'S A MORAL TURPITUDE CLAUSE
IN THE FAMILY TRUST.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.451
ONCE CONVICTED,
ALL JARED'S SHARES

21:18.538 --> 21:20.235
IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS
WENT TO GARDNER.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.933
BUT HE WOULD'VE ALSO GOT
THE SHARES IF JARED DIED.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.762
SO WHY NOT JUST KILL JARED?
WHY KILL UNDINE?[beeps]

21:25.849 --> 21:28.156
EXACTLY. WHY KILL UNDINE?

21:28.243 --> 21:31.507
HE WANTED TO SEE JARED SUFFER
OR HAD A THING FOR UNDINE
HIMSELF.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.335
[beep]

21:33.422 --> 21:37.644
EUREKA. I INPUT MARISKA KOPECKI
INTO THE SECURE SEARCH ENGINE.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.647
I GET AN I.M. LINK
TO A HEALTH CARE DATABASE

21:40.734 --> 21:43.040
THAT DOCUMENTS
MARISKA KOPECKI'S NOTIFICATION

21:43.127 --> 21:45.173
THAT SHE'S CHANGING HER NAME
TO VANNA CLOONEY.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.132
AH.I INPUT THE NEW NAME
AND GET A HIT.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.570
FOUR MONTHS AGO,
SOMEONE NAMED V.K. CLOONEY

21:50.657 --> 21:52.572
BOUGHT A CONDO IN MARIN.

21:52.659 --> 21:53.834
[Lisbon] NICE WORK.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.401
YEAH,
WEIRD THING, THOUGH--

21:55.488 --> 21:58.360
THE ORIGINAL I.M.
CAME FROM A CIVILIAN.

21:58.447 --> 22:03.147
A DR. JOE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOGGED ON
TO THE D.O.J. SECURE NETWORK.

22:03.234 --> 22:05.498
HOW DID HE KNOW
WHAT I WAS ASKING ABOUT?

22:05.585 --> 22:08.849
HOW DID HE ACCESS
THE HEALTH CARE DATABASE?
NOBODY'S ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.634
WHEN YOU SAY "DR. JOE
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,"
DO YOU MEAN

22:11.721 --> 22:15.595
D-R-J-O-E-N-H...

22:15.682 --> 22:16.770
YEAH.

22:18.641 --> 22:19.816
OH, MY GOD.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.691
OH, MY GOD.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.083
ASK, "WHO ARE YOU?"

22:29.391 --> 22:30.697
[beep]

22:30.784 --> 22:31.828
YES.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.836
[beep]

22:39.923 --> 22:41.490
"KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."

22:48.279 --> 22:49.759
[beeping]

22:52.762 --> 22:54.155
[Van Pelt] HE'S GONE.

22:54.242 --> 22:56.723
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

22:56.810 --> 22:59.682
HE SOMEHOW TAPPED
INTO THE D.O.J. SECURE NETWORK.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.771
HE'S BEEN SPYING ON US.

23:01.858 --> 23:06.210
CAN WE FIND THE SOURCE
OF THE I.M.?[types]

23:06.297 --> 23:09.083
[sighs]
THERE'S A SELF-DESTRUCT CODE
BUILT INTO THE UPLINK.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.693
IT DEAD-ENDS
AT THE SECONDARY SERVER.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.521
THERE'S NO WAY
TO TRACE IT BACK.

23:12.608 --> 23:16.046
HE WANTS US TO SUCCEED.
HE WANTS RENFREW
OUT OF JAIL.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.962
OUT WHERE HE CAN GET AT HIM--
TO SILENCE HIM.YES.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.790
WHICH MEANS RENFREW
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.576
WHICH MEANS HE HAS THE GOODS
ON RED JOHN.SLOW DOWN.

23:23.663 --> 23:26.883
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING YET.WE'VE TO GET RENFREW
OUT OF JAIL FIRST.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.972
OH, THAT'S ALL.AND WE WILL,

23:29.059 --> 23:31.018
AND THEN RED JOHN
WILL GO AFTER HIM.

23:31.105 --> 23:34.282
HE HAS TO BREAK COVER.
HE HAS TO.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.066
AND WE'LL BE WAITING
FOR HIM.

23:47.817 --> 23:50.559
UH...DAMN.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.301
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET US IN
WITHOUT YOUR MAGIC BADGE?

23:53.388 --> 23:55.216
YOU DO THE TALKING.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.958
NO, YOU TRY.DON'T BE CHILDISH.
I'M NOT--

23:58.045 --> 24:01.004
[Eastern European accent]
OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS HARRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

24:01.091 --> 24:03.746
HI. VANNA CLOONEY?YES.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.009
I'M TERESA,
AND THIS IS PATRICK.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.576
YES.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.448
CAN--CAN WE COME IN
FOR A MOMENT?

24:09.535 --> 24:10.579
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.716
IT'S TO DO WITH HARRY.WHAT ABOUT HIM?

24:16.803 --> 24:19.327
WELL, IT'S BEST NOT TO SPEAK
OUT HERE IN PUBLIC.

24:22.983 --> 24:26.029
[sighs]
OKAY, I LIED JUST NOW.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.858
WE'RE HERE TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER UNDINE.

24:28.945 --> 24:31.078
GET OUT.SIT DOWN.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.478
WHO ARE YOU?LISTEN TO ME,

24:39.565 --> 24:42.263
OR YOUR GUILT AND PAIN
AND SHAME WON'T EVER GO AWAY.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.526
IT WON'T GO AWAY
UNTIL YOU TELL THE TRUTH.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.572
WHAT TRUTH?
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

24:46.659 --> 24:50.184
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL.I DO KNOW YOU.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.926
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY
AS A YOUNG WOMAN,

24:53.013 --> 24:55.102
YOU DREAMED
OF SUCH GREAT THINGS,

24:55.189 --> 24:56.712
WHAT A LIFE YOU'D HAVE.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.453
AND WHAT DID FATE BRING YOU?

24:58.540 --> 25:01.195
25 YEARS OF DRUDGERY,
A SERVANT'S LIFE.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.110
YOU HATED EVERY DAY OF IT.

25:03.197 --> 25:06.113
WHO WANTS TO BE A SERVANT?
NOBODY.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.245
YOU DID IT FOR HER,
FOR UNDINE,

25:08.332 --> 25:11.727
SO THAT SHE WOULD HAVE
A BETTER LIFE.YES.

25:11.814 --> 25:15.252
AND THEN SHE WAS GONE,
TAKEN FROM YOU.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.560
IN A FLASH, YOUR WHOLE LIFE--

25:18.647 --> 25:20.954
ALL THOSE DAYS OF DRUDGERY
AND HUMILIATION--

25:21.041 --> 25:24.174
WASTED.
WHAT A JOKE, HUH?

25:24.261 --> 25:26.742
YES.
A JOKE.

25:26.829 --> 25:27.961
HA HA.

25:30.006 --> 25:32.966
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?I WANNA KNOW
WHO KILLED HER.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.055
WHAT'S IT MATTER
WHO KILLED HER?
SHE'S GONE.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.492
YOU DIDN'T SAY JARED.
THAT'D BE THE OBVIOUS--OKAY.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.973
JARED KILLED HER.
I DON'T CARE.

25:40.060 --> 25:43.193
IT'S TRUE. THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO THAT WILL BRING HER BACK.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.283
SO IF YOU GET PAID TO LIE
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, THEN, UH,

25:46.370 --> 25:48.677
WHERE'S THE HARM?WHAT PAID?

25:48.764 --> 25:50.374
NOBODY PAID ME ANYTHING.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.812
DON'T LIE TO ME.
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

25:52.899 --> 25:56.859
YOU TOOK YOUR 20 PIECES OF
SILVER AND BOUGHT THE LIFE
YOU ALWAYS WANTED, DIDN'T YOU?

25:56.946 --> 25:59.688
NO.IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.690
IT MEANS NOTHING.JANE.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.954
LOOK AT ME, MARISKA.
LOOK AT ME,
AND TELL ME I'M WRONG.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.783
YOU THINK
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING!
YOU KNOW NOTHING!

26:07.870 --> 26:10.438
I KNOW THAT JARED AND UNDINE
WERE LOVERS, WEREN'T THEY?

26:10.525 --> 26:14.311
AND YOU WERE PAID TO SAY
THAT THEY WEREN'T.

26:14.398 --> 26:15.748
SAY IT OUT LOUD.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.317
YES.

26:20.404 --> 26:21.667
THEY WERE LOVERS.

26:21.754 --> 26:24.147
WHO PAID YOU TO SAY
THAT THEY WEREN'T?

26:24.234 --> 26:26.933
I DON'T KNOW.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.283
A WHAT YOU CALL A...

26:29.370 --> 26:33.200
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.
HE CAME TO ME, AND HE OFFERED
ME A LOT OF MONEY.

26:33.287 --> 26:36.029
A LOT OF MONEY!
BUT I SAID NO.MM.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.421
[clears throat]

26:39.423 --> 26:40.642
HE OFFERED MORE.

26:42.731 --> 26:43.819
[laughs]

26:46.692 --> 26:47.649
I TOOK IT.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.085
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

26:49.172 --> 26:51.044
SAMSA.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.741
AUSTIN SAMSA.

26:52.828 --> 26:55.744
OKAY, CHO, THANK YOU.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.442
AUSTIN SAMSA'S DEAD.WHAT?

26:58.529 --> 26:59.966
HIT BY A BUS.DAMN.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.272
WE COULD GET A COURT ORDER
FOR HIS RECORDS.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.274
REMEMBER,
YOU'RE ON SUSPENSION.

27:04.361 --> 27:07.626
IF WE DON'T GET THIS CLOSED UP
BEFORE MINELLI GETS BACK,
WE'RE DONE.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.065
PLAN "B" THEN.WHAT'S PLAN "B"?

27:12.152 --> 27:13.588
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LIKE IT.

27:18.593 --> 27:21.161
WE NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOUR HUSBAND, MA'AM.

27:21.248 --> 27:25.078
WHO'S THE AGENT
IN CHARGE HERE?I'M AGENT LISBON.
THIS IS AGENT RIGSBY.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.558
AND I BELIEVE YOU'VE MET
MY COLLEAGUE PATRICK JANE.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.345
HELLO. I EXPECT YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I GATHERED YOU ALL HERE?

27:31.432 --> 27:34.653
BRECK, GO CALL THE POLICE.UH, MR. RENFREW, WAIT.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.091
UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY
RUINED IN A DELUGE
OF SORDID SCANDAL,

27:38.178 --> 27:40.876
YOU MIGHT WANNA
LISTEN TO ME.WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:40.963 --> 27:44.619
SOMEONE, I DON'T KNOW WHO,
PAID MARISKA KOPECKI

27:44.706 --> 27:47.274
A LOT OF MONEY
TO LIE ABOUT JARED AND UNDINE.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.494
THEY WERELOVERS,
AS YOUR BROTHER SAID.SO WHAT?

27:50.581 --> 27:53.019
THE FACT IS, THEY WERE FOUND
IN A LOCKED ROOM.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.368
IT'S NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE

27:54.455 --> 27:56.544
FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE GOTTEN
INTO THE ROOM

27:56.631 --> 27:59.590
TO COMMIT THE MURDER.YES, THERE'S THE RUB.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.723
THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.072
WATCH CLOSELY.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.076
[rattles]

28:08.817 --> 28:10.340
RIGSBY.MM.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.821
WOULD YOU PLEASE GO INSIDE
AND LOCK THE DOOR?

28:14.649 --> 28:15.694
[shuffles paper]

28:17.217 --> 28:20.568
SUPPOSE JARED AND UNDINE
ARE INSIDE SLEEPING.

28:37.411 --> 28:40.980
IT'S ALL VERY CLEVER,
BUT HOW DO YOU GET OUT
AGAIN?

28:41.067 --> 28:42.590
[shuts door]

28:42.677 --> 28:44.026
[rattling]

28:49.336 --> 28:50.467
[cord vibrates]

29:16.102 --> 29:17.843
[Patrick] CAN I BORROW
YOUR LIGHTER, PLEASE?

29:19.366 --> 29:20.584
THANK YOU.

29:23.674 --> 29:26.068
AND THAT IS HOW
JARED WAS FRAMED.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.375
COOL, HUH?IT DOESN'T MEAN
JARED'S INNOCENT.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.638
AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MEAN
SOMEONE ELSEIS GUILTY.

29:30.725 --> 29:34.381
IT'S A PARTY TRICK.A PARTY TRICK
A JURY WILL LOVE.

29:34.468 --> 29:37.253
PUT THAT TOGETHER
WITH MARISKA'S TESTIMONY,

29:37.340 --> 29:40.822
AND I THINK WE HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
OF WINNING A NEW TRIAL.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.477
THEN THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT
SOMEHOW.

29:43.564 --> 29:44.695
UNLESS...

29:44.783 --> 29:45.958
UNLESS WHAT?

29:47.916 --> 29:50.876
UNLESS WE CAN MAKE SOME KIND
OF FINANCIAL DEAL HERE

29:50.963 --> 29:54.183
THAT WOULD MAKE IT WORTH
OUR WHILE DROPPING ALL THIS.YOU WANT MONEY?

29:54.270 --> 29:56.533
YOU'RE BLACKMAILING US.EH, WE CALL IT LEVERAGE.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.971
BUT YOU'RE STATE AGENTS.EX-STATE AGENTS.

29:59.058 --> 30:02.539
THANKS TO YOUR SON HERE,
JANE WAS TOSSED OUT,
AND WE'RE GOING WITH HIM.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.367
WE NEED TO LOOK
AFTER OURSELVES NOW.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.891
WE WON'T BE UNREASONABLE.

30:05.978 --> 30:08.545
YOU PEOPLE ARE A DISGRACE.

30:08.632 --> 30:11.026
GET OUT.OH, WE'RE GOING.

30:11.113 --> 30:14.508
WE'LL GIVE YOU UNTIL 4:00
TO CALL US WITH AN OFFER.

30:14.595 --> 30:18.468
AFTER THAT, WE'RE GONNA MAKE
SOME CALLS OF OUR OWN.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.166
I'LL TELL YOU
WHO I'M CALLING.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.428
I'M CALLING THE FBI!

30:25.824 --> 30:29.088
AM I WRONG,
OR DID THAT GO DOWN
NOT QUITE AS YOU'D HOPED?

30:29.175 --> 30:32.265
I'VE HAD BETTER RESPONSES,
BUT I THINK WE MADE A SALE.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.441
YOU NEVER CAN TELL.WE'RE DOOMED.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.057
[Patrick] PATIENCE.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.192
PATIENCE.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.717
PATIENCE.

30:51.414 --> 30:53.112
IF YOU SAY "PATIENCE"
ONE MORE TIME...

31:05.428 --> 31:06.865
[ringing]

31:11.695 --> 31:12.740
HELLO?

31:15.395 --> 31:16.700
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.267
[closes cell phone]WHO WAS IT?

31:26.362 --> 31:29.496
I CONFESS,
I THOUGHT IT'D BE GARDNER
WHO CALLED ME.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.367
GARDNER? [chuckles]

31:31.454 --> 31:33.674
HE HASN'T THE GUMPTION.

31:33.761 --> 31:36.938
I WILL NOT SEE OUR FAMILY NAME
DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD AGAIN.

31:37.025 --> 31:40.768
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
TO KEEP QUIET?HMM.

31:40.855 --> 31:42.901
HOW MUCH
DID YOU GIVE MARISKA?

31:42.988 --> 31:44.728
I DON'T SAY
I PAID HER ANYTHING.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.295
YOU NEEDN'T BE EVASIVE.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.471
ONLY A GUILTY PERSON
WOULD RESPOND THIS WAY

31:48.558 --> 31:50.604
TO SUCH NAKED EXTORTION.

31:50.691 --> 31:53.737
I KNOW YOU'RE GUILTY.
I'M JUST NOT SURE WHY.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.611
YOUR SUSPICIONS
ARE NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.874
I ASKED YOU YOUR PRICE.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.181
YOUR LATE HUSBAND
WAS A HANDSOME MAN.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.792
YES, HE WAS. WHAT'S THAT
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

32:04.879 --> 32:07.621
DOMINEERING, THOUGH.
HAD TO HAVE THINGS HIS WAY.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.623
HE DIED HOW LONG
AFTER THE MURDER?

32:09.710 --> 32:12.234
A WEEK. AORTIC ANEURYSM.MM.

32:14.628 --> 32:17.892
AND MARISKA--
SHE LEFT YOUR EMPLOY WHEN?

32:17.979 --> 32:19.241
AT THE SAME TIME.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.983
AFTER HE DIED, THOUGH.

32:22.070 --> 32:22.984
YES.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.076
MAY I?

32:28.163 --> 32:29.208
THANK YOU.

32:31.471 --> 32:34.953
SO YOU GOT RID OF HER
AS SOON AS YOU COULD
AFTER HE DIED,

32:35.040 --> 32:39.087
BECAUSE UNDINE
WAS YOUR HUSBAND'S CHILD,

32:39.174 --> 32:40.436
WASN'T SHE?

32:47.139 --> 32:48.183
YES.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.361
AND YOU NEVER CONFRONTED HIM
OR MARISKA?

32:52.448 --> 32:53.493
NO.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.846
I DECIDED I LIKED MY LIFE
AS IT WAS.

32:58.933 --> 33:02.415
I DIDN'T WANT A DRAMA,
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIED TO.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.286
THEY NEVER KNEW I SUSPECTED.

33:04.373 --> 33:07.594
18 YEARS OF SECRET ANGER.

33:07.681 --> 33:10.205
HOW DID YOU STAND IT?

33:10.292 --> 33:12.729
NOBODY'S LIFE IS PERFECT.

33:12.816 --> 33:15.515
AND THEN WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
ABOUT UNDINE AND JARED'S AFFAIR,

33:15.602 --> 33:17.386
YOU MUST'VE BEEN ENRAGED.

33:17.473 --> 33:18.997
IT'S PRACTICALLY INCEST.

33:19.084 --> 33:22.000
IT IS. IT IS INCEST.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.439
WHEN I FOUND OUT, I--

33:26.526 --> 33:29.224
I TOLD JARED THAT HE WAS NOT
TO CONTINUE THE AFFAIR.

33:29.311 --> 33:30.399
HE REFUSED...

33:32.097 --> 33:34.360
SAID HE WAS IN LOVE
WITH HER.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.188
HE REFUSED
TO STOP SEEING HER.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.233
DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM
WHY YOU OBJECTED?

33:38.320 --> 33:39.582
CERTAINLY NOT.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.194
I COULDN'T TELL HIM.

33:44.631 --> 33:47.721
IT WAS TOO SORDID,
TOO HUMILIATING.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.897
INSTEAD, YOU KILLED UNDINE,
PAID OFF HER MOTHER

33:49.984 --> 33:53.335
AND SENT YOUR SON
TO JAIL FOR LIFE.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.163
NO.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.425
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.393
UNDINE'S BLOOD.

34:41.470 --> 34:43.472
[sighs] IT'S PROOF...

34:43.559 --> 34:46.258
I DID IT.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.521
I TOOK IT
SO I COULD CONFESS

34:48.608 --> 34:52.394
AND GET JARED FREED
WHEN I CHOSE.

34:52.481 --> 34:55.005
JUST AS SOON
AS HE LEARNED HIS LESSON.WHAT LESSON?

34:57.051 --> 34:59.488
EVERYTHING IN MODERATION.

34:59.575 --> 35:00.750
AND...

35:02.622 --> 35:04.014
LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.494
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.635
[sighs] GOOD?YEP.

35:15.722 --> 35:16.940
OKAY.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.075
WE'RE READY TO GO GET RENFREW.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.599
IS THE SAFE HOUSE ALL SET UP?YEAH.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.514
GOOD.

35:25.601 --> 35:29.214
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
OVER THERE LATER.JANE, PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

35:29.301 --> 35:32.260
REMEMBER, THIS IS PLAYING OUT
JUST LIKE RED JOHN WANTS IT TO.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.567
THIS IS PLAYING OUT
JUST LIKE IT HAS TO.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.612
HE HAS NO CHOICE
BUT TO SILENCE RENFREW.

35:36.699 --> 35:39.398
HE HAS TO SHOW HIMSELF.
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

35:39.485 --> 35:42.879
I CAN FEEL IT.YOU CAN FEEL IT?
LIKE A PSYCHIC THING?

35:42.966 --> 35:46.709
NO, I AM QUIETLY CONFIDENT
THAT WE WILL GET A BITE.

35:46.796 --> 35:50.148
YOU THINK YOU'RE PLAYING HIM,
AND HE THINKS HE'S PLAYING YOU.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.584
ONE OF YOU IS WRONG.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.155
THANK YOU.

36:00.506 --> 36:01.724
THANK YOU.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.948
I KEPT MY SIDE OF THE BARGAIN.
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

36:08.035 --> 36:11.473
TELL WHAT YOU KNOW.ABSOLUTELY.
ALL WILL BE REVEALED.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.171
BUT HERE?

36:13.258 --> 36:15.956
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO CATCH A BREATH OF FRESH AIR,

36:16.043 --> 36:18.741
AND THEN WE'LL SIT AND TALK
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

36:18.828 --> 36:22.049
AND I GOT A LOT TO TELL.
AND I OWE YOU... BIG-TIME.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.225
I OWE YOU MY LIFE.

36:24.312 --> 36:25.966
IN THE MEANTIME, UH,

36:26.053 --> 36:28.534
I WOULD KILL
FOR A CHEESEBURGER AND FRIES.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.492
DRIVE-THROUGH.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.190
PUT THIS ON.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.801
CAN'T YOU SAY "PLEASE"?
I'M A FREE MAN NOW.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.630
[sighs]
PUT THIS ON... PLEASE.

36:37.717 --> 36:38.892
SURE.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.729
[shouting indistinctly]

37:01.219 --> 37:03.221
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
[sighs]

37:05.397 --> 37:06.572
OH, JEEZ, COME ON.
