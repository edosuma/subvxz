WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.006
- No, no.
It makes no sense

00:06.049 --> 00:07.137
for you to run the meeting

00:07.181 --> 00:08.660
when the former manager
is here.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.401
I can do this
from muscle memory.

00:10.445 --> 00:11.533
- What are you talking about?

00:11.576 --> 00:13.013
Your body has
literally no muscle.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.144
Now give me the clipboard.
- No.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.276
- Give it to me!
- No.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.581
- Glenn, come on.
- I will not.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.018
- I order you to give to me.
- You order me?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.410
- Yes, I do--
- Sorry.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.585
Sorry I'm late.
- I don't take orders from you!

00:20.629 --> 00:22.022
Um, no problem.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.719
Just was running the meeting
for you--

00:23.762 --> 00:25.851
- We covered a lot of ground.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.376
- Parker's day care closed
at the last minute.

00:28.419 --> 00:31.422
Some kid had lice.
- Logan. Surprise, surprise.

00:31.466 --> 00:35.296
- So now Parker is here.
With his wet face, great.

00:35.339 --> 00:36.688
- Well, I mean, I didn't know
what else to do.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.690
My parents are out of town,
and Eric's working,

00:38.734 --> 00:41.345
and Adam's at a convention
learning how to do beekeeping.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.740
- Oh, if he wants bees,
I still got a ton in my car.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.830
- Okay, so, uh,
St. Patrick's Day. Right.

00:47.873 --> 00:51.181
Today we have a new "Follow the
Rainbow to Savings" initiative.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.531
Customers will follow
the clouds with rainbows

00:53.575 --> 00:55.011
to find coupons.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.622
- Oh, my God, he's so cute.
My ovaries are exploding.

00:57.666 --> 00:59.233
It's like,
scrambled eggs, anyone?

00:59.276 --> 01:00.886
- Oh, gross.
- Disgusting.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.975
- So Sarah, can you stock the--

01:03.019 --> 01:04.977
- Is it okay
to hold him like that?

01:05.021 --> 01:06.327
He seems uncomfortable.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.372
- No, he's totally fine.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.722
And this is a very standard way
to hold a child.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.160
- Maybe he's afraid of heights.
Put him on the floor.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.249
- You guys, he's good.
I promise.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.859
Okay, Cheyenne, Sandra,
you're serving

01:16.902 --> 01:19.209
our St. Patrick's Day
specialty snacks--

01:19.253 --> 01:20.515
- Amy, sorry to interrupt,

01:20.558 --> 01:22.256
but I think some pooping
is happening your way.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.822
- Yeah, I know.
I'll change him soon.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.433
- Oh, okay.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.478
We're just supposed to ignore
the human feces in the room.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.480
- She wants him to sit in it.
Teach him a lesson.

01:29.524 --> 01:30.916
- No, I'm just trying
to get through this.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.918
- All right, all right.
Come here, little buddy.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.399
I got you.
- Oh, my God.

01:35.443 --> 01:39.011
Jonah's holding Amy's baby
like it's his baby.

01:39.055 --> 01:42.058
- I live with him, Sandra.
I hold him every day.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.322
- I'm literally
screaming right now.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.765
- Like, I get
the concept of babies.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.245
I'm not even saying
don't have babies.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.420
Like, have babies.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.769
But do I have
to see the babies?

01:57.813 --> 01:59.380
- Mateo, could you
give me a hand?

01:59.423 --> 02:01.164
It's a dating thing,
and you're the only person here

02:01.208 --> 02:02.470
in a functional relationship.

02:02.513 --> 02:03.775
Justine, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.299
Just because you send money
to a man in Ghana

02:05.342 --> 02:06.430
does not make him
your boyfriend.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.040
Relationship status--

02:08.084 --> 02:09.433
"it's complicated."

02:09.477 --> 02:11.000
- It's really not.
- Yeah, I'll help.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.610
Anything to keep looking busy.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.743
Otherwise Amy's gonna ask me
to walk her baby or whatever.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.353
- So you're dating someone?
- Yup.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.660
Dr. Brian Patterson.
It's been a couple weeks.

02:18.703 --> 02:21.402
I just--I really think
this could be something.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.882
Not the normal cold,
anonymous sex I'm used to.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.232
No offense, Garrett.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.234
- Ah, well, we were
literally wearing name tags,

02:27.277 --> 02:28.278
but generally speaking, yes.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.845
- So it's his birthday,

02:29.888 --> 02:31.499
and I wanna give him a picture
of the two of us together,

02:31.542 --> 02:33.109
but we haven't really
had any taken yet,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.937
so I thought maybe
you could Photoshop something.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.895
I have his picture.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.332
- Did you steal his license?

02:38.375 --> 02:41.161
- Uh, yeah, you can't ask
to borrow someone's license.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.032
They'll think you're a freak.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.294
- I can whip something up.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.601
He's cute.
Ooh, 6'1".

02:46.644 --> 02:49.386
- Mm-hmm, and his proportions
are a dream.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.127
Nipples exactly
where you want 'em.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.737
Mm.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.264
- Can you turn that for Mama?

02:57.307 --> 02:58.874
- Just in case this isn't
what you wanted to do

02:58.917 --> 03:00.745
for the next 10 minutes,
you want me to take him?

03:00.789 --> 03:03.357
- Yes, that would be great.
Thank you--just be careful.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.662
All he wants to do is
open your eyelid

03:04.706 --> 03:06.316
and scream into it right now.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.799
Uh, never mind.
Go--go deal with that.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.758
- Oh, sir.
Sir, it's just the coupons.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.369
We didn't hide anything
in the products.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.371
- Oh, yeah?
Then what's this?

03:17.414 --> 03:20.243
The prizes are in the cereal!
- No, it's...

03:20.287 --> 03:23.464
No, that's just--have you
not had cereal before?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.250
- The glitter was my idea.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.209
Makes it look
more magical, right?

03:29.252 --> 03:31.341
- Is that edible glitter?

03:31.385 --> 03:33.256
- I mean, technically
all glitter is edible.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.127
It's really small.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.825
- Oh, okay.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.742
Hey, wasn't Jonah cute
holding Parker?

03:40.785 --> 03:42.091
- I guess.

03:42.134 --> 03:45.137
- I just meant he looked
like a really good dad.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.704
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

03:46.748 --> 03:50.142
Wouldn't it be crazy if Jonah
actually was Parker's dad?

03:50.186 --> 03:51.840
- Yeah, that'd be wild.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.886
But Amy was already pregnant
when she and Jonah had sex.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.411
- Unless she just thought
she was pregnant.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.195
It could've been
a false positive.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.805
- Oh, yeah.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.243
There was this girl in my class
who thought she was pregnant,

04:03.286 --> 04:04.809
and then she went away
for a few months.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.071
And when she came back,

04:06.115 --> 04:08.465
it turned out that her mom
had a miracle baby,

04:08.509 --> 04:11.076
like, way late in life.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.556
- Uh-huh.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.471
- Happy St. Patrick's Day,
shoppers.

04:14.515 --> 04:17.082
Corned beef and cabbage
are 20% off.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.433
If you're dying to impress
your friends with wet meat,

04:19.476 --> 04:21.565
now's the time.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa--hold on.
What is this?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.700
- It's for Brian.
Mateo nailed it.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.268
- Don't you think that
this is a little...big

04:28.311 --> 04:29.834
for a first birthday together?

04:29.878 --> 04:31.923
- Well, it needs to be big in
order to secure the balloons.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.925
16, one for every day
we've known each other.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.711
- Or maybe since you
just started dating,

04:36.754 --> 04:38.974
you could go with something
like, and I'm being crazy here,

04:39.017 --> 04:40.280
but something like a card?

04:40.323 --> 04:41.759
- A card?

04:41.803 --> 04:43.544
He's not
in the hospital, Garrett.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.285
- Yeah, thanks a lot.
I...

04:45.328 --> 04:47.678
I know what's happening.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.201
He's trying
to give me bad advice

04:49.245 --> 04:52.248
because he wants to sabotage
my relationship with Brian.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.425
You still want me.
You poor bastard.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.427
- No, I just think
that this is a lot

04:57.471 --> 04:59.951
for any human man to take.

04:59.995 --> 05:03.303
- Oh, Garrett, let it go.
It's over, okay?

05:03.346 --> 05:04.782
There are women
on the internet.

05:04.826 --> 05:05.870
Dozens of them.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.786
- Hey, Amy.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.440
I saw you were having
a little bit of trouble,

05:10.484 --> 05:11.485
so I thought it might help

05:11.528 --> 05:13.356
if Jerusha came in
to watch Parker.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.403
- Oh, my God.
That would be amazing.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.970
Thank you so much.
- It's really no problem.

05:19.014 --> 05:21.843
We were just picking up some
T-shirts at Cracker Barrel.

05:21.886 --> 05:25.368
But we're happy to have a
little playdate with this guy.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.283
- Yes, that's so fun.
- Yeah.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.241
You go back to being
big boss lady.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.548
Full-time mom is on the case.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.812
- Well, yeah, I mean,
I am also a full-time mom.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.815
- Yeah, but Jerusha's
a super mom.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.475
- Saving babies in need.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.608
- Well, I mean, "saving"
is a little strong.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.871
And "in need,"
but--but thank you.

05:49.914 --> 05:54.310
And now other super mom is
gonna go check the inventory!

05:54.354 --> 05:55.616
♪ Bah-bum

05:57.052 --> 05:58.619
Okay.
Bye, Parker.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.664
- What was that?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.623
- I don't know what
she was doing.

06:05.669 --> 06:08.629
- Look at her grip that block.
Confidence of a gladiator.

06:08.672 --> 06:09.934
It's impressive
my amniotic fluid

06:09.978 --> 06:12.023
managed to offset
all that Sturgis DNA.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.590
- Well, you watch her
pinken in the sun

06:13.634 --> 06:16.332
and tell me that she's
not full Sturgis.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.335
- Okay, um, here is
Parker's diaper bag.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.642
There are some fruit squeezies
there if he gets hungry.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.034
- Oh, that's okay.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.645
I can just give him
some of Rose's fruit mash.

06:24.688 --> 06:25.863
It's homemade.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.343
- Jerusha makes
all of Rose's food.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.040
She's never even tasted sugar.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.173
Rose, I mean.
Jerusha's tasted sugar.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.784
- Don't care for it.
I'm a baking soda gal.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.438
- Well, I mean,
they are organic.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.440
There's, like,
four ingredients, so--

06:37.484 --> 06:39.921
- I make mine
with a very special ingredient.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.923
Do you know what
that ingredient is?

06:41.966 --> 06:44.099
- I think I can guess.
- Is it palm oil?

06:44.142 --> 06:45.753
Because it's destroying
our rain forests.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.885
- It's love.
Isn't that cute?

06:47.929 --> 06:49.452
- So cute, yeah.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.628
Um, so anyway,
thanks again, Jerusha.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.109
Lifesaver.
- My pleasure.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.198
You know, it might be nice
for Parker to get some

06:56.241 --> 06:58.853
one-on-one attention instead
of being lost in the crowd

06:58.896 --> 07:00.245
at day care.
- Yeah.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.683
- Oh, well, I mean, there's,
like, seven kids there.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.032
It's a really good ratio.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.381
- Yeah, but her ratio's
one-to-one.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.688
So that's seven times better.
That's just math.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.167
- Well, Parker loves day care.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.213
He loves it so much that
sometimes I come to pick him up

07:11.256 --> 07:12.693
to take him home,
and he starts crying.

07:12.736 --> 07:13.868
- Ooh.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.304
- Not because he doesn't
want to go home.

07:15.347 --> 07:18.046
He's very happy...
at home and at daycare.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.656
He's happy.
- Oh, yeah.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.486
No, we think Parker's doing
great under the circumstances.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.706
I mean, you should be
proud of him.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.534
- I am.
I'm very proud of him.

07:27.577 --> 07:31.102
He's doing great.
He's bright and he's curious--

07:31.146 --> 07:32.408
- Is this a dog toy?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.715
- No. What?
It's a--it's a squirrel.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.414
That squeaks.
That's what squirrels do.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.633
- Do they?

07:39.676 --> 07:41.373
- I don't know, Dina.
I didn't make the toy.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.072
- I make all of Rose's toys.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.900
- Yeah.
Okay.

07:45.943 --> 07:49.251
- It says "anticonvulsants
can cause a false positive

07:49.294 --> 07:50.861
in a pregnancy test."

07:50.905 --> 07:53.429
Maybe Amy was taking those.
- She must have been.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.084
I've never seen her convulse,
like, ever.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.826
But wait, she also
looked really pregnant.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.044
- Right.

08:00.088 --> 08:03.700
But maybe, she was faking it.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.355
- So Adam would think it's his

08:06.398 --> 08:09.314
and have to pay them
child support.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.666
That's smart.
Get that beekeeping money.

08:12.709 --> 08:14.537
- You know how I'm producing
Brian's birthday?

08:14.581 --> 08:17.148
I'm trying to get a tribute
band, and I need your opinion.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.411
I found this live-action
version of the Beastie Boys--

08:19.455 --> 08:21.370
- The Beastie-Boys
were live-action.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.459
- Wait, so it wasn't a cartoon

08:23.503 --> 08:25.635
where every beast played
a different instrument?

08:25.679 --> 08:28.029
Well, I like my version better.
- Look, man.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.335
Dina's plan,
it's insane, right?

08:30.379 --> 08:32.250
- Oh, yeah, it's off the rails,

08:32.294 --> 08:33.600
but I'm not gonna
tell her that.

08:33.643 --> 08:34.775
It's Dina.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.254
She doesn't respond well
to outside input.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.647
She's like Tyler Perry.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.562
- All right, well, she's
gonna scare this guy off.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.783
- I know, it's crazy.
Someone should stop her.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.219
Besides us, I mean.

08:45.829 --> 08:48.615
- Who do they think they are?
- Yes, exactly, thank you.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.312
Ugh, "made with love."

08:50.355 --> 08:53.010
Yeah, I bought those
fruit squeezies with love.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.359
They're in the expensive part
of the store

08:54.403 --> 08:55.709
with the beeswax candles.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.449
- She's home all day.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.887
She has nothing but time
to cut up fruit.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.453
Hell, she could even
macerate them.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.325
Maybe chiffonade
a little mint on top.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.807
- Yeah, she could totally
do whatever you just said.

09:06.850 --> 09:10.288
- You are an amazing mom.
Parker is an awesome kid.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.683
And if I'm being honest,
Rose has kind of a weird smell.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.685
- Oh, my God, she totally does.
- Yeah.

09:15.729 --> 09:16.904
She kind of smells like,

09:16.947 --> 09:18.514
and I don't even know
what I mean by this,

09:18.558 --> 09:19.602
a parlor.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.865
- Yes, like a parlor.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.389
In a house.
Where people gather.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.695
- Yes.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.523
- Hey, Justine,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.351
that erotic bakery you used
for your birthday,

09:29.394 --> 09:31.092
are they open to putting
non-nudes on a cake?

09:31.135 --> 09:32.354
- Ooh, I don't know.
Probably not.

09:32.397 --> 09:33.964
It's a religious thing
for them.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.313
- Got it.
I'll keep looking.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.488
I'm getting Brian
a birthday cake

09:36.532 --> 09:37.751
with a bunch
of his baby pictures on it.

09:37.794 --> 09:39.056
- Okay, hold on.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.623
I thought you just had
his driver license photo.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.103
- Yeah, but it'll be easy
to get baby photos

09:42.146 --> 09:43.713
now that I tracked down
his mom.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.149
- His mom?
- Yeah.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.369
- Yes, Garrett, we found
Brian's mother on Instagram.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.240
- Yup, there's a lot
of Sue Pattersons out there,

09:49.284 --> 09:50.502
but if you devote
an hour to it,

09:50.546 --> 09:52.026
eventually you'll find
the right one.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.028
Right, Mateo?
- Hour and a half.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.377
- Okay, this has gotta stop.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.988
Sorry I'm being so insensitive.

09:58.032 --> 10:00.512
Here I am talking about
my incredible relationship

10:00.556 --> 10:03.515
when clearly,
Garrett wants me back.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.561
And me front.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.694
A little St. Patrick's Day
humor there for you.

10:07.737 --> 10:11.393
- Okay, you know what, Dina?
I'm gonna say this as a friend.

10:11.436 --> 10:14.048
But you are coming on
way too strong,

10:14.091 --> 10:16.528
so strong that it's terrifying.

10:16.572 --> 10:21.229
Your actions are gonna haunt
this man until the day he dies.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.926
And I'm not the only one
who thinks it.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.275
Everybody else does too.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.103
They're just
too chicken to say it.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.584
But I'm not
'cause I'm your friend.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.152
- Is that how
you both feel as well?

10:31.195 --> 10:33.415
- Um, maybe?

10:33.458 --> 10:34.764
- Yeah, when you
add everything up,

10:34.808 --> 10:38.725
I could see how it could
tip towards crazy.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.248
- Hmm.

10:40.291 --> 10:44.252
Well, as your friend,
I'd like you all to know

10:44.295 --> 10:45.862
your faces look like butts.

10:48.256 --> 10:51.172
- ♪ Precious memories

10:53.827 --> 10:54.871
- Wow.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.439
- Hey, guys,
Rose just sang a song.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.441
- Yeah, she's making up tunes
all the time.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.835
I forget that most kids
don't do that.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.707
But maybe it's 'cause she's
home with Jerusha all day.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.623
You know, who's practically
a walking glockenspiel.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.712
- Parker has some tricks
up his sleeve too.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.192
Jonah, do the--
do the high five.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.629
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, watch this.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.152
High five.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.850
- Look, they have
the same hands.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.679
- High five.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.115
High five, buddy.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.856
- Just hold on.
He'll do it.

11:22.899 --> 11:23.987
It's really cute.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.946
Jonah, do it like
you do it at home.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.339
- Yeah, I am--
- No, no, but do the voice.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.124
- Well, I'm in front
of a bunch of people,

11:30.167 --> 11:31.473
so I'm not gonna do the voice.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.736
- I should get back to work.
- Yeah, me too.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.651
- Guys, you're not paramedics.
Your work can wait.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.609
Just--come on, Jonah.
Please do the voice.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.701
Hey, Parker, high five.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.659
High five.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.139
- No, you're still
not doing it right.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.358
- This is how I do it.
High five.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.971
- Oh, that--that, that was it.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.886
Wow.
Great.

11:52.929 --> 11:56.237
And you've taken him to
a doctor, and he's doing fine?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.587
No, he's doing fine.
He's doing great.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.893
- Yeah.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.590
- Good job, Parker.
- No, no, that wasn't it.

12:01.633 --> 12:02.765
You guys,
don't clap for that.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.680
- Oh, cool.
My dog has the same toy.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.116
- What?
No, it's not--

12:06.160 --> 12:08.771
it's not a dog toy.
I got it here in the store.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.339
- In toys?
- No, in clearance, but it's--

12:11.382 --> 12:12.775
- Oh, yeah, that is a dog toy.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.342
- Potty.
- Oh.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.780
- Well, I heard that.
Okay, sweetie, let's go.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.565
- Did she say "potty"?
- Yay!

12:20.609 --> 12:22.611
- She's potty-trained
at 16 months?

12:22.654 --> 12:25.527
- Yeah, but don't put that kind
of pressure on Parker, okay?

12:25.570 --> 12:27.659
'Cause he's got enough
to deal with.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.400
Let's go.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.185
- Up, boy.
Up.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.708
- He's not a dog!

12:36.799 --> 12:38.105
- Maybe they're right.

12:38.148 --> 12:39.106
Maybe if I was home all day,

12:39.149 --> 12:40.803
Parker would be peeing
in a toilet

12:40.847 --> 12:42.152
and playing with human toys.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.675
- Stop it.
You're a great mom.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.155
And plus, I mean,

12:45.199 --> 12:47.592
do we even know that
Rose is potty-trained?

12:47.636 --> 12:48.942
- What?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.813
- She says potty,
and Glenn takes her away.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.467
We don't know what happens
in that bathroom.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.990
- Do you think he's lying?

12:54.034 --> 12:56.558
- Glenn's been rubbing Rose
in our face all day.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.733
Think about it.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.300
He took a demotion
just to be with her.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.997
He's very invested.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.346
- Yeah, I mean,
for all we know,

13:02.390 --> 13:04.784
it could be, like,
diaper city in there.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.700
- Do you want me to go check?

13:08.744 --> 13:10.702
- No, come on.
That would be crazy.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.095
- I mean, I do
kind of have to go.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.097
- Well, if you're gonna
go anyway, then yeah, sure.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.534

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
- Oh, my God.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.734
Jonah?
- Ow, my eye.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.780

It was a stupid idea

13:54.094 --> 13:56.096
I'm--I'm not very good at this.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.880
I think I'm just gonna call

13:57.924 --> 13:59.316
- Oh, don't do that.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.057
I mean, I'm sure he wants
to see you on his birthday.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.146
- No, he'll see me around.
We shop for the same things.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.975
Food, soap, stamps.
- What has gotten into you?

14:06.019 --> 14:08.021
You're acting like you've
never dated someone before.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.065
- Well, I haven't.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.632
Not someone I wanted
to stick around.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.764
And it's his birthday, and
all I have left to give him is

14:12.808 --> 14:15.506
a piñata full of condoms, and
now I'm even questioning that.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.248
- Oh, okay, well, yeah.
Don't--do not give him that.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.207
- See?
- Okay, just keep it simple.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.948
Take him out to a nice dinner.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.340
- I don't even know
what a nice dinner is.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.951
Is it a hot soup
followed by a cold soup?

14:24.994 --> 14:26.343
Is it a place that
gives you bread?

14:26.387 --> 14:28.258
Is it a place that wants you
to bring your own bread?

14:28.302 --> 14:30.304
- What are you talking about?
You've had dinner before.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.784
- Not as a girlfriend!
- It's very similar!

14:32.828 --> 14:34.264
- I am so sorry, Jonah.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.440
I--I have no idea
how this happened.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.615
- It's fine.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.921
People get hit by doors
all the time.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
It's very common.
- Can I get you more water?

14:41.097 --> 14:43.926
Starve a fever,
hydrate a black eye.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.624
- Sure.
Thank you.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.931
- Why were you standing
so close to the door?

14:48.975 --> 14:51.107
Were you, like,
spying on Glenn?

14:51.151 --> 14:53.893
- No, of course I wasn't--no,
I was checking on something.

14:53.936 --> 14:54.937
- On what?

14:54.981 --> 14:57.070
I was just taking Rose
to go potty.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.550
- Allegedly.
- "Allegedly"?

14:59.594 --> 15:01.117
- I mean, I just wanted to see

15:01.161 --> 15:03.250
if Rose actually
was potty-trained.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.816
- Why would you think
he was lying?

15:04.860 --> 15:08.516
- It's just--it's very advanced
for a child Rose's age.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.039
- Oh, well, Rose is advanced.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
You see, when you have
a full-time mom at home--

15:12.085 --> 15:15.392
- Stop saying that.
All moms are full-time moms.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.612
Like when I'm here,
Emma's still texting me,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.527
telling me she's gonna die
without Rebo.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.702
I don't know what Rebo is.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.964
Now I have to go online
and find out.

15:22.008 --> 15:22.965
Is it an app?
Is it a shoe?

15:23.009 --> 15:24.445
Is it a boy?

15:24.488 --> 15:27.883
- Amy, you work full-time.
You're doing the best you can.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.406
And it'll be good for Parker

15:29.450 --> 15:32.192
to have to overcome
some disadvantages.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.586
Like Oscar the Grouch
grew up in a garbage can,

15:35.630 --> 15:37.980
but he's still on Sesame Street
just like all

15:38.024 --> 15:40.330
those other puppets
who are friendly and clean.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.158
- I'm sorry,
are you calling my child

15:42.202 --> 15:44.465
a disadvantaged, filthy Muppet?

15:44.508 --> 15:45.945
- No apologies, Amy.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.991
You are a boss bitch,
and your career is your baby.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.341
- No.
My baby is my baby.

15:51.385 --> 15:54.823
- Hey, Parker's fine, okay?
We're not neglecting him.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.347
Every night, we give him
a bath, we read him stories,

15:57.391 --> 15:59.262
we sing him to sleep
in his crib--

15:59.306 --> 16:02.700
- Wait, he sleeps in a crib?
- Where else would he sleep?

16:02.744 --> 16:03.745
- Rose sleeps with us.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.747
That's why we got
a California full.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.749
- So it's like all three of you
in there together?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.404
Like some kind of sexless,
Midwestern pot pie?

16:10.447 --> 16:12.319
- Uh-huh.
- Actually, people now think

16:12.362 --> 16:14.016
that bed-sharing makes it
harder for kids

16:14.060 --> 16:15.670
to learn how to sleep
on their own.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.889
- Well, Petey sleeps in bed
with me every night.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.239
Mama's a pushover.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.719
- Oh, for God sake, Justine,
a dog is not a child.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.286
Yes, it's cute, and it drools,

16:23.330 --> 16:26.289
and you have to feed it
and teach it things, but...

16:27.334 --> 16:29.118
There are some differences.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.946
- Yeah, Petey can high five.

16:32.165 --> 16:35.211
- ♪ Hey Mr. Burr,
that really smarts ♪

16:35.255 --> 16:38.388
♪ Why'd you go and shoot me
in the heart ♪

16:38.432 --> 16:42.262
So that was "Hamilton,"
you guys.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.872
I never saw the show,

16:43.915 --> 16:47.006
but I overheard people talking
about it at the yarn store.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.704
- So we bullied Rose
out of diapers?

16:49.747 --> 16:52.576
- All I'm saying is that maybe
instead of forcing your child

16:52.620 --> 16:54.926
into something new, let them
tell you when they're ready.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.406
It's like Parker
and his pacifier.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.669
- He still uses a pacifier?
- Mm-hmm.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.628
- So you're not worried
about dental problems,

17:00.671 --> 17:02.499
speech delays, looking lame.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.240
- No, he'll give it up
when he's ready.

17:04.284 --> 17:05.850
Yeah--well, yeah.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.417
We decided to let him keep it

17:07.461 --> 17:09.202
even though those are
all valid points.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.030
- Well, I thought we were
on the same page about this.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.683
Are you the one
taking his pacifiers?

17:12.727 --> 17:15.034
- I was gonna give them back
when he learned moderation.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.774
- I let Emma give it up
when she was ready.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.602
- I think this might be a point
in Jonah's column.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.083
- Yeah, Emma's nice,
but she doesn't really pop.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.302
- This isn't about Emma.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.912
This is about Parker and Rose,

17:23.955 --> 17:25.522
and how to decide
which one's better.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.220
- What--no.
- Not what this is about.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.395
- What if they had
a competition?

17:28.438 --> 17:30.962
- Oh, yes.
Like an obstacle course.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.442
Petey does those.
- They're not dogs.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.444
- Different Petey.
Petey the person.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.271
- Hold on.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.925
I have to say as a mom,

17:36.968 --> 17:39.188
I think that putting babies
in an obstacle course

17:39.232 --> 17:40.798
sounds pretty hilarious.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.974
- We're not putting our babies
through an obstacle course.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.498
- Yeah, besides, it's not fair

17:44.541 --> 17:47.109
to make Parker prove himself
against Rose.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.241
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?

17:48.284 --> 17:49.633
- You don't think Parker
could beat Rose?

17:49.677 --> 17:52.984
- Parker would destroy Rose
in an obstacle course.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.551
Okay.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.857
- Uh, yeah, he would

17:55.900 --> 17:58.207
because he spends all day
at a day care center

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
running around with other kids

17:59.948 --> 18:03.256
while poor, little Rosie sits
at home with an old schoolmarm.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.996
- What did you just say?
- You heard her.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.476
Or is your hearing
starting to go?

18:06.520 --> 18:07.564
- A little.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.306
But it is on, Buster Brown.
- Great.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.308
Mateo, set up
the obstacle course.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.657
And just to be clear,

18:13.701 --> 18:16.225
I really appreciate
Jerusha watching Parker.

18:16.269 --> 18:19.141
- No problem!
She loves it.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.886
- Behold, the Baby Dome!

18:24.929 --> 18:27.671
Two babies enter,
one baby leaves.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.371
And then the other baby
leaves too.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.415
Yeah, it's very safe.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.461
- You get him, Rose.
No mercy.

18:34.504 --> 18:35.723
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.333
Yeah, it's just a little
friendly competition.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.075
Hey, buddy, do you remember
when your blankie flew out

18:40.119 --> 18:41.859
of the car window
and you went nuts?

18:41.903 --> 18:44.471
That energy.
Find it.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.646
- Do you see
Jonah's eyes right now?

18:45.689 --> 18:47.256
He's, like, full-on crazy.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.476
- I know.
It's so sweet.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.781
- All right.
Babies at their mark!

18:50.825 --> 18:51.826
- Okay.

18:51.869 --> 18:54.655
- Ready, set, throw down!

18:56.135 --> 18:58.180
- Okay, Parker, here you go.
Don't worry about Rose.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.529
You just focus on your game.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.183
- Come on, Parker!
Eat her alive!

19:04.882 --> 19:07.189
- Well, this is
a nothing burger.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.582
- Yup.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.846
- I'm not mad.
Just disappointed.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.717
We'll talk about it
in bed tonight.

19:15.545 --> 19:16.677
- Make a reservation
at Ramona's.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.026
You like that
neighborhood, right?

19:18.069 --> 19:19.593
- Of course.
It's full of Lithuanians.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.985
They can't get enough of me.
- Okay.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.205
So we've got Ramona's,
axe throwing,

19:23.249 --> 19:24.685
and vegan frozen yogurt.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.774
- Yeah, but do you think
frozen yogurt is a little too

19:26.817 --> 19:28.689
"sorry kids, Grandma's dead"?

19:28.732 --> 19:31.431
- What?
No, frozen yogurt is fun.

19:31.474 --> 19:32.736
You're in charge
of your own destiny.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.303
You could mix grapefruit
with espresso.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.478
- Yeah, but I don't think
anyone should have

19:35.522 --> 19:36.653
that much power.

19:36.697 --> 19:37.915
- That's part
of the excitement.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.700
Okay, frozen yogurt it is.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.745
Well, we planned
one hell of a date.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.530
- Game over.
Nobody does it better.

19:43.573 --> 19:44.879
- Okay, I gotta get going.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.924
- Yeah.
Where--where are you headed?

19:46.968 --> 19:48.752
- I gotta get ready.
Brian's off work in an hour.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.538
- Oh, yeah.
Great--yeah, of course.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.148
Yeah, you gotta get going.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.020
- Yeah, well thanks, buddy.
- Mm-hmm.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.196
Anytime.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.418
- You were kind of going
wild back there.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.854
- Oh, only me?

20:03.898 --> 20:05.508
- A little nervous
about how you're gonna be

20:05.552 --> 20:06.727
once he starts
playing football.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.381
- Oh, he won't be
playing sports.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
- Really, 'cause Adam was
a football player.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.560
- Yeah, but I've been dosing
him on two hours of NPR daily,

20:13.603 --> 20:17.085
so the closest he's coming to
sports is maybe marching band.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.392
- But if he's gonna be running
away from bullies anyway,

20:19.435 --> 20:21.089
maybe he joins track too?

20:21.132 --> 20:23.091
- Can you run?
Are you a runner?

20:23.134 --> 20:25.615
Don't get up.
You're obviously very busy.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.443
- You know, mopping up
glitter vomit

20:27.487 --> 20:29.271
isn't as bad as regular vomit.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.707
It makes me feel like
I'm cleaning up

20:30.751 --> 20:32.405
after a wasted unicorn.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.710
- Yeah, yeah.

20:33.754 --> 20:37.018
So I got it.
- What?

20:37.061 --> 20:38.628
- Jonah's DNA.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.937
- You took that from Jonah?
- Yeah.

20:42.980 --> 20:46.636
And I found one
of Parker's pacifiers.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.378
So now we just send them
to the lab with $200

20:49.422 --> 20:51.424
and then wait for the results.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.903
- Oh.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.428
Yeah, you know, I don't
wanna do that, no offense.

20:55.471 --> 21:00.215
It just crosses so many lines
and is, like, super crazy.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.130
- Oh. Yeah.

21:02.173 --> 21:05.438
I hadn't thought
about the lines.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.788
So, um...

21:07.831 --> 21:11.357
Could you, like, not tell
Jonah and Amy about this?

21:11.400 --> 21:15.796
- Oh, sorry, but I kind of
just think I'm gonna.

21:15.839 --> 21:19.321
- Of course.
Yeah, totally get it.
