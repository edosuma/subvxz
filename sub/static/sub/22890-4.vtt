08:50.200 --> 08:51.433

There's sh-- everywhere.

08:51.433 --> 08:52.767

my friends over,

08:53.000 --> 08:53.767
and you're gonna have
to deal with it,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.367
or you can leave.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.000
- Why do you have to come
to my house?

08:57.033 --> 08:58.300
- Because they stayed
the night last night.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.066
- Jax, I'm sorry;
we were sitting here

09:00.100 --> 09:01.734
peacefully eating Taco Bell,
and you walked in with--

09:01.767 --> 09:03.066
- This is my house!
I can come wherever I want!

09:03.100 --> 09:05.000
- It's Brittany's house too!

Jax, go.
- No.

09:08.233 --> 09:09.567

how to act

09:09.600 --> 09:11.066
in my own home
that I pay my bills.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.600
- I am. I am.
- This is my home.

09:17.066 --> 09:18.467
- This is not the end
of the world.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.200
You're making it
like the end of the world,

09:20.233 --> 09:21.567
and you're not
that devastated.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.033

09:40.066 --> 09:42.100

married people cheating.

09:42.133 --> 09:43.734
When Katie was
in New York--

09:43.767 --> 09:45.100
- Before they got married.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.433
- No,
while they were married.

09:46.467 --> 09:47.500
- Back it up.

- You're making it like

Go!

Go!
- This is my house.

but I'm also allowed here.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.433
Do I want to hear this?
Absolutely.

10:21.467 --> 10:23.400
I want to hear it from Brittany.

I don't want to hear it

and we're all sitting there.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.633
- I'm not dating
those four whatever.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.400
- Thank God, Jax.
- Thank God.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.333
- Everything was fine until
you went to that damn party,

10:43.367 --> 10:45.100
and then those girls
just filled your head.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.600
They're all so damn insecure
about their own issues,

10:46.633 --> 10:48.533

- Why are you pointing fingers
so that you take the blame awa--

10:50.667 --> 10:52.000
- Because none of you had
the right or--

10:52.033 --> 10:53.100
none of you are perfect.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.367
You can't judge anybody.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.500

Did you hear the way
that Jax was speaking to her?

10:59.767 --> 11:03.000
Damn right he should be
smacked around.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.700
And job well done.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.266
- I'm hurt!

11:06.300 --> 11:07.567
- Well, then come
and talk to me, then.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.433
- I have been trying
to talk to you.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.166

11:11.200 --> 11:14.166
I'm going to f---ing go crazy

and you have no f---ing right
to judge or do anything.

but this is every single day.

Oh, you weren't there
this morning.

14:18.133 --> 14:19.433
That's the better question.

14:19.433 --> 14:20.633
- What happened
this morning?

14:20.667 --> 14:22.166
- We decided
to get Taco Bell.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.567
Brittany's, like,
not even two bites in,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.300
and F---face comes home.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.100
And then she got up
from the couch

14:27.133 --> 14:30.033
and ran over to him
and hit him.

14:30.033 --> 14:32.333
- Honestly,
I'm just disappointed

14:32.367 --> 14:34.066
that I didn't get
to see Brittany

is never the answer,

14:45.700 --> 14:47.300

14:47.333 --> 14:49.066
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm getting there.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.533
- Hi, love bug!

14:50.567 --> 14:52.734
Dude, I'm so hyped.
- Yeah, me too.

14:52.734 --> 14:55.333
- I've been juicing today
so I have my summer body on.

14:55.333 --> 14:56.600
Chic-y fleeky.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.166
- I had Taco Bell today.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.567
- So tomorrow,
the jet leaves at 1:00.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.467
So we'll just go together.
- Perfect.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.133
- Private or first class
is how Lala flies.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.166
My boyfriend does very well
for himself,

15:08.200 --> 15:10.467
so we get to fly private.

15:10.467 --> 15:12.300
I mean, if you guys
flew private,

15:12.333 --> 15:13.700
you could always fly out later.

15:13.734 --> 15:15.033
- I'll fly with the rest
of the world.

15:15.066 --> 15:17.066
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.633
- If you're not ugly
and you have a pair of tits,

15:19.633 --> 15:21.734
you're gonna be able to go
on a private jet.

15:21.767 --> 15:25.233
I spoke to Lisa
and asked her

15:25.266 --> 15:27.233
if the mothership
would welcome back

15:27.233 --> 15:28.734
their fellow alien.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.633
- And then we can carpool,
since we're neighbors.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.633
Lala and I have been friends
over two years,

15:32.633 --> 15:35.500
but we've really only gotten
super close

15:35.500 --> 15:37.300
the last six months.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.100
We don't fight,

15:39.133 --> 15:42.100
and it's just like I have
another Ariana.

15:42.133 --> 15:44.633
Katie also did make a comment
about your boyfriend again.

15:44.633 --> 15:47.233
- Katie made a comment
about my man?

15:47.233 --> 15:49.600
- Yeah.
- What the f--- did she say?

15:49.633 --> 15:51.633
- She--'cause I was, like,
saying about the jet,

15:51.667 --> 15:53.734
and she goes, "Oh,
her married boyfriend's jet?"

15:53.767 --> 15:55.100
I go, "He's not married."

15:55.100 --> 15:56.533
And she was like, "Really?"

15:56.533 --> 15:58.000
She's like,
"Well, ask his wife."

15:58.033 --> 16:00.000
- "Well, I saw it--
I looked online.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.533
I read it.
I read it somewhere."

16:02.567 --> 16:04.400
Get the f--- up
out of here, bitch.

16:04.433 --> 16:06.233
Last year, the girls felt

16:06.266 --> 16:08.467
that I was attacking Katie,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.133
and in return, they were

16:11.166 --> 16:15.233
labeling me as someone
that broke up a home.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.400
You've been throwing rocks.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.767
- Like, why?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.200
Because I call you, like,
a whore?

16:19.233 --> 16:21.066
Well, I mean...

16:21.100 --> 16:23.333
I call it as I see it.

16:23.367 --> 16:26.734
- That is the furthest thing
from the truth.

16:26.767 --> 16:29.200
And you're gonna mention
my man again?

16:29.233 --> 16:32.734
Are you trying to get popped,
or are you trying to get along?

16:32.767 --> 16:34.133
Because we can go both ways.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.400
- I don't want to get popped.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.300
- My blood is boiling.
- I know.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.133
- I'm a little confused.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.300

before they got married.

- And she goes, "Dude, he can't
keep his hands off of me."

18:06.100 --> 18:08.233
They made out.
He was, like, touchy-feely.

18:08.233 --> 18:10.066
I was down for her.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.767

say anything.

with Katie,

and not from the rumor mill.

of the party.

of the cake is right.

at a million Sur parties,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.500
but this is different,

19:38.533 --> 19:40.400
because I'm actually going
to learn

19:40.433 --> 19:43.100
how a party at Sur is set up

24:50.667 --> 24:53.133
And then I brought
special flowers

24:53.133 --> 24:54.133
instead of the normal ones.

24:54.133 --> 24:56.000
- Okay.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.767
- Just everything needs
to be pretty as sh--.

- Hey.
- Hi.

Are all the appetizers--

25:18.200 --> 25:19.700
Everything's, like,
ready to go?

25:19.734 --> 25:21.300
- Yes, I'm ready.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.300
- You know how much
I love you?

25:22.333 --> 25:23.700
- Okay, I know how much.

25:23.734 --> 25:26.133

Hungry.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.400
- Yeah?

25:27.433 --> 25:28.767
Let's grab something
to eat, then.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.033
- Any appetizers?

25:31.033 --> 25:32.367
- Good to see you.
Okay, good, good.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.767
- How are you?
- Good.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.500
- Should we?
All right, all right.

25:35.533 --> 25:38.033
- How are you?
- You look beautiful.

25:38.033 --> 25:40.200
- It's a Belgian salad,

25:40.233 --> 25:42.467
so it's like pear,
gorgonzola cheese...

25:42.500 --> 25:44.567
- How's it going?
- How are you?

25:44.600 --> 25:46.133
- Good.
Good to see you.

25:46.166 --> 25:48.066
There he is.
Thank you very much.

25:48.066 --> 25:50.600
Likewise.
Happy birthday, man.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.033
- How are you?
- Hey, man.

25:53.066 --> 25:54.734
- Thanks, dude.
- Everybody got drinks?

25:54.767 --> 25:56.700
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

25:59.567 --> 26:01.033
How do you work this?

26:01.066 --> 26:02.266
I'm panicking.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.166
Okay, Kristina.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.200
This now has to be--
there's no way this won't work.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.700
And if it is, I'm just not meant
to have this job.

- Have fun.

26:23.734 --> 26:27.433
- Oh, Lordy.

26:27.467 --> 26:29.066
- Hi.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.300
- Hi, Lisa.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.300
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

26:34.333 --> 26:35.700
- Oh, thank you.

26:35.734 --> 26:37.567
- Give it to me.
You're an animal.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.333
- Stassi's actually followed
my direction,

26:39.367 --> 26:41.033
and she's kind of included

26:41.066 --> 26:43.600
some kind
of emotional component

26:43.633 --> 26:44.767
to this party.

26:44.767 --> 26:45.767
- I need you all to go over

26:45.767 --> 26:47.500
to my cool station

26:47.500 --> 26:49.033
and take a photo
and write Guillermo a message

26:49.066 --> 26:50.633
in the cool book.

26:50.633 --> 26:53.500
- She has a lot to do
for an event like this,

26:53.500 --> 26:55.200
but the most
important thing is,

26:55.233 --> 26:58.033
just make sure
everybody's happy.

26:58.066 --> 26:59.300
And that, really,

26:59.333 --> 27:00.734
sometimes can be
quite demanding.

27:00.767 --> 27:02.367
- Guillermo,
for his birthday,

27:02.367 --> 27:04.400
I think you should just
do one up my skirt.

27:04.433 --> 27:06.266
- [laughs]

27:06.266 --> 27:08.533
- There's one you can use.

[both laughing]

27:10.133 --> 27:11.633
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.500
- Hi.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.266
- Does her makeup not look
like a Victoria's Secret angel?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.100
- Yeah.

27:17.133 --> 27:18.467
- You always look like
a Victoria's Secret angel

27:18.500 --> 27:20.000
unless you're crying

27:20.000 --> 27:21.333
because your boyfriend's
a giant asshole.

27:21.367 --> 27:22.400
- I'm not talking
about Jax.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.734
Just so you guys know,

27:23.767 --> 27:25.400
I'm not gonna bring it up
at work,

27:25.433 --> 27:27.133
because I'm already starting
to get emotional,

27:27.166 --> 27:28.233
and I'm trying
to figure this out for me,

27:28.266 --> 27:30.000
no one else but me.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.200
I'm just starting
to get worked up again.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.367
- I'm sorry.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.734
- I love my friends so much,

27:34.767 --> 27:36.100
and they're all so worried
about me,

27:36.133 --> 27:37.367
and I really appreciate it.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.734
But I just need some time
to think

27:39.767 --> 27:42.133
and just get my mind right.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.667
I can figure out
what I want to do,

27:43.667 --> 27:45.700
so I'm just getting, like,
very frazzled,

27:45.734 --> 27:48.133
and I'm, like,
trying to work and stuff--

27:48.166 --> 27:52.233
- I'm glad he's not here
while you are working, at least.

28:03.467 --> 28:05.166
- Here he is.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.300
- I can't believe this.
- The man himself.

28:07.333 --> 28:10.633
- Where are the degenerates
of the group tonight?

28:10.667 --> 28:12.266
Who needs shots?

28:12.300 --> 28:13.700
- It's honestly been really cool

28:13.700 --> 28:15.300
since Jax and I
patched things up.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.567
I saw you have absinthe
on the menu.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.500
What's the strongest one?

28:19.533 --> 28:21.567
- The strongest one is probably
gonna be the Pernod.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.433
- No, no, no.

28:23.467 --> 28:25.400
- I'm gonna show him
what it's like to party with JK.

28:25.433 --> 28:27.333
You know, we're gonna get
the shots rolling.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.200
Things could probably get
very rowdy.

12 years ago...

33:21.033 --> 33:23.533
- Two shots of absinthe later...

33:23.567 --> 33:25.166
I can't even say "absinthe."
- I know.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.100
- I have to say it
like an American.

33:27.133 --> 33:30.166
[with American accent]
Two shots of absinthe later...

33:30.166 --> 33:31.400
- [laughs]

33:31.433 --> 33:33.433
- Look, it wrote it!
It wrote it.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.533
Some people say that absinthe
tastes like licorice

33:35.567 --> 33:38.033
or anise, but really it tastes
like a little green fairy

33:38.066 --> 33:40.166
goes down your throat
and rips your balls

33:40.166 --> 33:42.000
right out of your throat
through your mouth.

33:42.033 --> 33:44.633
You know, say this stuff's
hallucinogenic.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.300
Like, if you stare
at something long enough--

33:46.333 --> 33:48.300
- Yes, man.
I'm freaking out.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.700
Like--
Oh, no.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.500
- All right,
my whole depth perception

33:52.533 --> 33:54.166
is really f---ed.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.633
- How many pictures
are on that wall?

33:57.300 --> 33:58.533
- Which wall?

33:58.567 --> 34:00.467
- Are you seeing flashing dots?

34:00.500 --> 34:02.667
Watch this.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.700
A trick I learned
back in the day.

34:04.734 --> 34:07.066
Now you see it.
- What?

34:07.100 --> 34:09.033
[burps]

34:09.066 --> 34:11.000
- I just want to run my head
into that wall right now,

34:11.033 --> 34:12.433
and I feel like
it would feel okay.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.400
This is some potent sh--.

34:14.433 --> 34:16.600
I kind of, like, feel like
I'm, like, floating

34:16.600 --> 34:18.000
out of my chair

34:18.033 --> 34:21.200
and, like, I could see God.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.734
And the past, present,
and future

34:22.767 --> 34:26.000
are kind of just, like,
coming together.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.333
How the f---
am I gonna get home?

34:27.367 --> 34:30.400
- So while you have
this state of Zen,

34:30.433 --> 34:33.200
what's your status
with, like, Brittany right now?

34:33.200 --> 34:35.200
- We're living together.
We're trying to work it out.

34:35.233 --> 34:36.734
- Did you guys have sex today?

34:36.734 --> 34:39.166
- We've had sex more
since this happened

34:39.200 --> 34:40.333
than I have in three months.

34:40.367 --> 34:41.533
- All right, all right.

34:41.567 --> 34:43.233
- I think she's hate-f---ing me.

34:43.233 --> 34:46.100
- A hate-f--- is
a horrible, horrible feeling.

34:46.133 --> 34:47.233
- No, it's great.
It's been great sex.

34:47.233 --> 34:48.633
I love it.

34:48.633 --> 34:49.633
I've been having
a great time with it.

34:49.633 --> 34:51.100
- Okay.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.500
- I'd like to transition
the hate

34:52.533 --> 34:54.500
more, maybe, to the love
at some point.

34:54.533 --> 34:57.500
- Okay, so you're liking
this raunchy stuff.

34:57.533 --> 34:59.333
- But for--yes.

34:59.367 --> 35:00.567
You ever heard of
the Madonna syndrome?

35:00.600 --> 35:02.233
- No.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.367
- It's about when you have
your princess.

35:03.367 --> 35:04.734
You love her to death,

35:04.767 --> 35:06.633
and you want nothing
to happen to her.

35:06.633 --> 35:07.767
But you just want to go out
and just, like,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.567
get your nut off with--

35:09.600 --> 35:11.200
You don't want to do that
to your princess.

35:11.233 --> 35:12.633
You just want to do it
with whatever.

35:12.633 --> 35:14.767
- There's having the cake
and eating it too.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.367
And there's having a slice
and wanting the full shebang.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.633
- [laughs]

35:20.667 --> 35:22.200
Bartender,
I'll take another one.

35:22.233 --> 35:23.667
Where is the bartender?

35:28.567 --> 35:30.266
- If you start decorating,

35:30.266 --> 35:31.533
there's tons of different,
like, stickers

35:31.533 --> 35:33.133
and stuff like that.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.333
And just write him a note.

35:34.367 --> 35:35.367
- Cute.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.266
- What's up, baby?

35:37.767 --> 35:40.500
- I just got
f---ing reamed out there.

35:40.533 --> 35:42.200
- Who was it?
Ariana?

35:42.233 --> 35:43.734
Did she want to talk to me
about this?

35:43.767 --> 35:45.533
- Uh, I mean, I don't know.

35:45.567 --> 35:46.633
- Ariana.

35:46.667 --> 35:48.000
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:48.033 --> 35:49.066
It's okay.
It's okay.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.266
Don't worry.
[laughs]

35:50.266 --> 35:51.734
Don't.
Bubba, don't panic.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.233
It's okay.
- You guys talk about it.

35:53.266 --> 35:54.533
I just feel like it's not--

35:54.567 --> 35:56.333
- Apparently, I was sh--faced

35:56.367 --> 35:57.767
and I made out--

35:58.000 --> 35:59.266
- Don't do that now.

35:59.266 --> 36:00.533
- Oh.
- Don't do that here.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.734
- Apparently,
I was sh--faced.

36:01.767 --> 36:03.667
Apparently, I got sloppy drunk

36:03.700 --> 36:05.767
and made out with somebody,
which I have no recollection of.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.567
- [sighs]

36:08.600 --> 36:10.700
- I just have
no recollection of it,

36:10.734 --> 36:14.033
which sounds like
a convenient narrative--

36:14.033 --> 36:16.166
I don't know.
I have no idea.

36:16.166 --> 36:17.667
- Yes, yes,
in the last nine months.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.633
This is--
he doesn't remember it.

36:20.667 --> 36:22.266
- I really don't.
Like, it's not like--

36:22.300 --> 36:24.367
I know I f---ed up
in the past, and--

36:24.400 --> 36:26.100
- I heard about it.
I told him about it.

36:26.133 --> 36:28.166
I told him
so he could tell you.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.533
- I have no recollection
of it.

36:29.567 --> 36:31.767
- When?
- January, February?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.033
- Recollection of what?

36:34.066 --> 36:35.100
- Well, apparently,
I got drunk

36:35.133 --> 36:36.300
and made out with--

36:36.300 --> 36:38.100
- Who was there?
Who was there?

36:38.133 --> 36:39.700
- I swear to God I have
no recollection of it.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.633
- How do you know?
- I've done this in the past.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.467
I know it's in my wheelhouse.
- How does Lala know?

36:46.033 --> 36:48.066
- No, no.

36:48.066 --> 36:49.600
No.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.133
- Oh, God,
they're storming out.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.734
- To be respectful of her.

36:52.734 --> 36:55.200
- You're kidding me.
You're f---ing kidding me.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.066
- I have zero recollection
of this, zero.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.033
- There's no way
this happened on my watch.

37:00.066 --> 37:02.333
- Hey, guys.
- What is happening?

37:02.333 --> 37:04.300
- Apparently, Tom is cheating
on me again.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.133
So that's cool.

37:06.166 --> 37:09.166
- He does not remember having
a drunken make-out

37:09.200 --> 37:10.533
in January or February.

37:10.567 --> 37:12.600
- Wait, why is this
coming up right now?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.200
- Because I was told this
yesterday,

37:14.233 --> 37:15.467
and I can't just sit here
and not tell--

37:15.500 --> 37:17.033
- Who told you this
yesterday?

37:17.066 --> 37:18.700
- Lala.

37:18.734 --> 37:20.567
- Okay, I desperately
don't want to believe this.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.433
- Schwartz is the one
who blurted it out, though.

37:22.467 --> 37:24.200
- Usually, with this group,

37:24.233 --> 37:26.200
where there's smoke,
there's fire.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.066
So it's possible
that he did something

37:29.100 --> 37:30.100
and he doesn't remember.

37:30.133 --> 37:31.500
But on the other hand,

37:31.500 --> 37:33.633
Lala's not
the most reliable source.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.367
- But what did I do?

37:35.367 --> 37:37.300
Is this some kind of karma
to punish me?

37:37.333 --> 37:39.066
- No, it's not.
- What have I done?

37:39.100 --> 37:41.600
- What is wrong with him?
What is wrong with him?

37:41.633 --> 37:44.367
- You guys, don't get her
fired up. Come on.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.233
- I am not trying to get her
fired up at all, Schwartz.

37:47.266 --> 37:50.166
- Tom, I let you.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.600
You're untethered.

37:51.633 --> 37:52.633
I let you go
and have drinks with your boys.

37:52.633 --> 37:54.233
- Bubba, don't cry.

37:54.266 --> 37:55.767
Do not cry, Bubba.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.633
- Don't cry?
- Hey, you guys--

37:57.667 --> 37:59.500
- Don't cry?
- It's embarrassing.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.734
- Things have been nothing
but good between us.

38:01.767 --> 38:03.200
You can't stop making out
with people

38:03.233 --> 38:04.200
that aren't your f---ing wife.

38:04.233 --> 38:05.467
- Bubby, Bubby--

38:05.500 --> 38:06.467
- What the f---
is wrong with you?

38:06.500 --> 38:08.100
You need help.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.200
- Bubba, I have
no recollection of this.

38:09.233 --> 38:11.333
- That doesn't mean anything.

38:11.367 --> 38:13.000
I have already been
down this road

38:13.033 --> 38:15.000
with Tom cheating on me.

38:15.033 --> 38:16.767
- I went to, like,
an afterparty,

38:17.000 --> 38:21.233
and I actually did, like,
make out with that girl.

38:21.266 --> 38:24.100
- I feel like this is just
some kind of bad dream.

38:24.133 --> 38:25.133
- Just talk to me, dude.
- No.

38:25.166 --> 38:26.667
- Have some perspective.

38:26.667 --> 38:29.400
- Get it the f--- together.
Get it together.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.400
What is wrong with you?

38:31.400 --> 38:33.266
[intense music]

38:41.066 --> 38:41.233
- Cheers.

38:41.233 --> 38:41.533
- Cheers.
I love you, Guillermo.

38:43.266 --> 38:44.600
- I don't understand this.

38:44.633 --> 38:46.100
He's telling me
to have perspective.

38:46.133 --> 38:48.500
Have perspective?
- It's okay.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.133
- My only perspective

38:50.133 --> 38:51.734
is that he cannot got out
for a night

38:52.000 --> 38:53.266
and get drunk
and not make out with someone

38:53.300 --> 38:54.433
who isn't his wife.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.000
- I know, but not right now.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.633
- That's it.
What is wrong with him?

38:57.667 --> 39:00.133
What is wrong with him?
What is wrong with him?

39:00.166 --> 39:02.300
- It's hard for me
to have feelings about this.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.567
Like, when I f---ed up
in the past, you know,

39:03.567 --> 39:05.300
it's like I knew I f---ed up.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.100
This, I have no recollection of.

39:07.133 --> 39:08.133
- Why is she so upset?
- Oh, God.

39:08.166 --> 39:10.000
Apparently--

39:10.033 --> 39:11.667
I can't tell you, Lisa.
It's too embarrassing.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.500
- I've heard everything.
Why is your wife upset?

39:14.533 --> 39:16.500
- I feel like a lost puppy.

39:16.533 --> 39:17.567
I don't know how to respond.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.033
- What are you talking about?

39:19.033 --> 39:20.166
- Apparently, I got sh--faced

39:20.166 --> 39:22.567
and I made out with a girl

39:22.567 --> 39:25.000
who happened to be friends
with Lala.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.300
- Schwartz,
what is this?

39:27.333 --> 39:29.567
- I don't know.
That's the thing.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.367
- Is this
since you've been married?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.166
- I mean, apparently, yeah.

39:33.166 --> 39:35.133
Yeah.
[chuckles]

39:35.166 --> 39:37.066
I know.
It's so embarrassing.

39:37.066 --> 39:38.333
- Hold on a second.

39:38.367 --> 39:40.066
You got married.
Do you remember that?

39:40.100 --> 39:41.600
- Yes, of course.
- Do you remember that?

39:41.600 --> 39:43.467
DO you remember that
f---ing ring on your finger?

39:43.467 --> 39:45.200
I take this personally,
because I gave my time.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.400
I went to the woods.

39:46.433 --> 39:48.166
I officiated this marriage.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.667
Tom, do you take Katie
to be your wife?

39:50.700 --> 39:53.200
Do you promise
to love, honor, cherish...

39:53.200 --> 39:55.700
And protect her,
forsaking all others,

39:55.734 --> 39:58.567
holding unto her
forevermore?

39:58.600 --> 40:00.734
- I do.

40:00.767 --> 40:03.600
- Is he doing
the exact opposite?

40:03.600 --> 40:04.600
- It's really embarrassing.
- Is it true?

40:04.600 --> 40:06.066
- I don't know.

40:06.066 --> 40:07.700
- Well, of course
you would know.

40:07.734 --> 40:09.300
- You would think I would,
but I get so sh--faced

40:09.333 --> 40:10.333
that I have no recollection
of it.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.667
- You get so sh--faced

40:11.700 --> 40:13.066
that you don't know
what you're doing?

40:13.100 --> 40:14.333
- Yeah.
- You know what?

40:14.367 --> 40:15.767
I'm at a loss for words
right now.

40:15.767 --> 40:17.300
- Just try not
to get worked up just yet,

40:17.333 --> 40:19.166
because we don't know--

40:19.200 --> 40:20.633
no one knows anything
right now,

40:20.667 --> 40:23.367
and I don't want you
to be upset.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.300
- I'm embarrassed.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.600
- Do you want to go
in the back?

40:26.633 --> 40:27.633
Or do you want to go
to the bathroom?

40:27.667 --> 40:28.633
Let's go to the bathroom.

40:28.667 --> 40:30.467
- As his friend--

40:30.500 --> 40:31.633
I'm not, like, sticking up
for him, but I've--

40:31.667 --> 40:33.066
- Well, no, please don't.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.233
- I've done this before,

40:34.233 --> 40:35.467
and I get so drunk that I--

40:35.500 --> 40:37.066
it's not like--
I'll never--

40:37.100 --> 40:38.467
- You don't think
that might be a problem?

40:38.500 --> 40:39.767
- Trust me; this is, like--

40:40.000 --> 40:41.600
- I don't trust you
at all right now.

40:41.633 --> 40:44.600
I am getting in bed
with this man...

40:44.633 --> 40:45.633
not literally, thank God.

40:45.667 --> 40:47.367
That's Katie's job.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.066
But in a partnership.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.233
Am I gonna come in
the night after

40:51.233 --> 40:53.767
and he's gonna be wasted,
lying on the couch,

40:54.000 --> 40:56.600
with all the money gone
and the keys on the pavement?

40:56.633 --> 41:00.667
And he's gonna say,
"Well, I don't remember."

41:00.667 --> 41:02.100
No.

41:02.133 --> 41:03.633
- Dude, I just--

41:03.667 --> 41:06.367
I've seen Schwartz be, like,
really drunk.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.000
I've seen Jax, like,

41:08.033 --> 41:09.600
literally push a girl's face
onto his.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.533
- All of you are starting
to look pathetic,

41:11.567 --> 41:13.667
the way you constantly
defend each other.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.100
- I'm not defending him
for a f---ing second.

41:16.133 --> 41:18.266
But I am mad at you.
- I know you are.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.266
- I'm really mad at you.

41:19.300 --> 41:20.667
- No, no.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.533
- What the f--- is wrong
with this guy?

41:22.567 --> 41:25.000
- Now Lisa's upset.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.266
I don't want to bring Lisa
into this.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.533
This is embarrassing.
- I know.

41:27.567 --> 41:29.200
F---, man.

41:29.233 --> 41:30.667
- Go back.
Let's go over here.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.266
- Apparently, my husband...
- I heard.

41:32.300 --> 41:35.066
- Can't f---ing keep it
to himself.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.266
What if I just went out f---ing?

41:36.266 --> 41:37.500
I'm like, "I don't remember."

41:37.533 --> 41:38.600
I would not get away with that.

41:38.633 --> 41:40.300
- I am sorry.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.400
- It's all the time,
but I love him so much.

41:43.433 --> 41:45.000
- Well, he loves you.

41:45.033 --> 41:47.166
I--I do not know
what to say right now.

41:47.166 --> 41:48.767
Right now,
I'm looking at you,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.166
and I'm trying to think
of words to give you, and--

41:51.200 --> 41:54.367
- We've been so, so good.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.500
So good.
Why--

41:56.533 --> 41:58.100
What did I do
to deserve this?

41:58.133 --> 41:59.433
- You did nothing, Katie.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.133
This is not your fault.
Stop it.

42:02.166 --> 42:04.033
- I just thought
this was in our past.

42:04.066 --> 42:07.000
I thought
this was in our past.

42:07.033 --> 42:10.567
- ♪ Throw your
pretty little lies ♪

42:10.567 --> 42:15.533

42:18.166 --> 42:20.133
- We need to talk to you.
- Wait, what?

42:20.166 --> 42:21.600
- It has to do with Rob.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.066
- We can't get married
until July.

42:24.066 --> 42:27.200
- He kissed some chick.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.066
- I'm telling you not to get
f---ing blackout drunk

42:29.100 --> 42:30.266
so you don't cheat on me again.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.700
- Of course.
Of course.

42:31.734 --> 42:33.133
- And you're telling me
I can't tell you

42:33.166 --> 42:34.600
that you can't do that anymore.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.600
- Bubba, stop.
- Who the f--- are you?

42:36.600 --> 42:38.533
I don't know you, 'cause you're
not the person I married.

42:38.567 --> 42:41.266
- The housewarming party,
do you still want to do it?

42:41.300 --> 42:42.600
- I guess, if you want.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.200
Let's cheers

There's audio.

42:53.166 --> 42:55.166
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes, let me hear.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.467
- I just feel
really f---ing f---ed up.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.500
