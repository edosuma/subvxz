for a week.
- Yeah.

13:11.794 --> 13:15.465
Last year at Boston general,
they had seven patients

Hey!

from you, Daniels.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.927
Phil. Phil, come back.

13:44.994 --> 13:46.996
I gotta go

A little warm.

I'm on fire.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.659

I'm sure she has loads
of medicines, cures, spells.
[ sneezing ]

14:22.665 --> 14:25.501
the Acetaminophen
didn't help?
I didn't take it.

14:25.568 --> 14:28.604
I can't-- I can't, uh,

14:28.671 --> 14:31.808

Live in an incubator?

A germ-Free adolescence?

14:34.010 --> 14:37.380
Don't make fun.
Come on. I'm a sick man.
Aw.

go home and stay in bed.

14:53.696 --> 14:56.032
And wait for you, right?

<i>Well, there you are. I, uh,
sort of gave up on you.</i>

15:31.100 --> 15:33.269
I had to make
a phone call.
Why don't we go sit--

15:33.336 --> 15:35.838
We're in the middle
of the game.
Peter and I need to talk.

15:35.905 --> 15:38.574
That's okay. I'll just
sit right there.

19:08.117 --> 19:10.586
No. Can't say I have.
Should I?

19:10.653 --> 19:14.123
Well, if a doctor treated
an abscessed eye
with a lancet...

19:14.190 --> 19:16.125
and the eye was lost,

19:16.192 --> 19:19.195
the doctor's hands
were lopped off Immediately.

Lucky for you,
that was 3,700 years ago.

But I thought you said
they didn't have a case.

"Delay in operating."

Well, so you don't panic.

This family
is clutching at straws.

20:02.138 --> 20:04.640
The last thing they want to do
is see a jury.

20:04.707 --> 20:08.177
What you're saying is that
this is all a big act before
they ask for a settlement,

20:08.244 --> 20:10.246
that they could really
care less about a trial?

20:10.313 --> 20:12.281
Bingo.

Well, I sure as hell care.

I'm not gonna
let it slide.
I'm right.

20:39.642 --> 20:41.878
And for once,
this crazy hospital
is right.

20:41.944 --> 20:45.114
They want a lawsuit?
The runneger family
wants a lawsuit?

20:45.181 --> 20:47.216
Fine. As far as
this Doctor's concerned,
they got one.

20:47.283 --> 20:50.353
We're gonna take this lie
and throw it right back
in their faces!

20:51.521 --> 20:53.523
You know what a jury is,
Dr. Chandler?

20:53.589 --> 20:57.960
Twelve people chosen to say
who has the better lawyer.

20:58.027 --> 21:00.029
I'm damn good.

21:00.096 --> 21:03.232
But I couldn't do much
without a damn good defendant.

21:04.267 --> 21:06.235
What-- What do you mean?

21:06.302 --> 21:10.873
What I mean is this.
We may not see a jury
for a very long time.

21:10.940 --> 21:14.010
So don't waste all that passion
yelling at me.

21:14.077 --> 21:16.079

I broke a glass.
Big deal.

And what about you?

23:36.185 --> 23:39.989
I'm going to be showing
Dr. Anya around Boston.

23:40.056 --> 23:43.126
You know what she told me?
The damnedest thing.

23:43.192 --> 23:48.197
In her part of hungary,
they have this special
festival bread.

23:48.264 --> 23:51.601
I mean, it takes months
of fermenting and baking.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.669
And then they preserve it
with spices...

23:53.736 --> 23:57.907
So they can use it
at country dances
and Weddings.

23:57.974 --> 24:00.543
Isn't that
a marvelous tradition?
I'd love to try that bread.

24:00.610 --> 24:02.845
I'll bet you
it is out of this world.

24:02.912 --> 24:05.948
I don't think I've ever heard
anyone carry on like that
about bread.

24:09.018 --> 24:11.387

Yep.

24:13.489 --> 24:16.959

When you're 20, you figure
anything can happen.

I could run for president,
make a million bucks,

24:32.008 --> 24:34.577

and get settled.

would never happen again.

I didn't mean that at all.

Look at

If we go to trial and lose,

So, what's it going to be--
out of court or in?

28:30.980 --> 28:34.984
Not so fast. This is something
the hospital board of directors
has got to decide.

He was driving
out near leominster,
and he sideswiped a tree.

42:58.881 --> 43:03.286
- Is he okay?
- Well, he wasn't hurt,
but it was a close shave.

an ONCOMING car by a hair.
