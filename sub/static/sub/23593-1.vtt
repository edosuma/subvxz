00:38.954 --> 00:43.015
I never figured Hal Crane would have
the nerve to string up barbed wire.

00:43.492 --> 00:45.551
It's more than barbed wire.

00:45.828 --> 00:49.730
It's a thousand head of my steer
dying for feed and water.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.297
Oh, you just have to drive your
herds across his land once a year.

00:56.038 --> 00:58.302
You could still work out
something reasonable.

00:58.374 --> 01:00.001
I'm through being reasonable.

01:00.075 --> 01:02.509
I told Crane what would happen
if he strung that wire.

01:02.578 --> 01:07.242
Blaise, we've pulled over
some hard hills together

01:07.349 --> 01:09.943
and I've rode behind you all the way.

01:10.452 --> 01:15.151
A wire fence is a poor excuse to make
a widow out of Crane's wife.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.525
What have you been
thinking about all winter?

01:20.596 --> 01:24.157
Crane's barbed wire fence,
or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?

02:53.689 --> 02:55.452
Oh, hi, strangers. It's good to see you.

02:55.524 --> 02:56.786
Hi, Ernine.

02:56.859 --> 02:58.121
Ernine...

02:58.460 --> 03:00.792
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.

03:01.096 --> 03:03.621
I didn't think you men would get out
in this kind of weather.

03:03.699 --> 03:06.600
Ernine, put up some coffee.

03:06.735 --> 03:09.636
You boys must be eating
pretty good at your place.

03:09.705 --> 03:12.674
Sure ran through
that last batch of supplies awful fast.

03:12.741 --> 03:15.175
I didn't come to town for supplies.

03:15.244 --> 03:17.337
I came here to get a shave.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.874
Look, Blaise,
these farmers have got a right to live, too.

03:20.949 --> 03:22.610
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.

03:22.684 --> 03:24.948
You're doing a pretty brisk trade
with them, aren't you, Vic?

03:25.020 --> 03:26.749
They're decent, hard-working folks.

03:26.822 --> 03:28.585
All they ask out of life is
a break from the weather

03:28.657 --> 03:31.490
and a chance to work their lands in peace.

03:32.528 --> 03:34.655
You ever know me
to break the peace, Vic?

03:34.730 --> 03:37.790
No, but I've seen you put away
some who tried to.

03:37.866 --> 03:39.333
I don't hold for killing.

03:39.401 --> 03:41.164
You don't have to.

03:41.670 --> 03:44.503
As long as you've got somebody
to do it for you.

03:44.573 --> 03:47.269
I'm beholden to you
for what you've done in the past,

03:47.342 --> 03:49.572
but things is changing
and we've got to change with them.

03:49.645 --> 03:50.839
I don't object to change,

03:50.913 --> 03:52.403
just fences,

03:52.614 --> 03:54.241
barbed wire fences.

03:54.316 --> 03:58.844
Well, I warned Hal Crane he was foolish
for ordering that load of wire.

03:59.655 --> 04:02.089
You ordered it for him, didn't you, though?

04:02.157 --> 04:05.524
A man has the right
to spend his own money as he sees fit.

04:05.594 --> 04:08.256
You declared yourself, Vic,
that's all I want to know.

04:08.330 --> 04:09.592
Crane's a proud man.

04:09.665 --> 04:11.428
He won't knuckle down.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.990
But he's a farmer.

04:13.068 --> 04:15.593
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.

04:15.671 --> 04:17.103
You call his hand, it'll be plain murder.

04:32.788 --> 04:34.449
Hello, Mrs. Crane.

04:37.159 --> 04:38.626
Hello, Vic...

04:39.227 --> 04:40.353
Dan.

04:41.563 --> 04:43.053
Mr. Starrett.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.467
If you'll just give me your list,
I'll get right to it

04:47.536 --> 04:49.834
so you can leave town before dark.

04:49.905 --> 04:52.999
We're not leaving. Hal wants to stay
overnight to settle some business.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.804
Coffee's on, boys.

04:54.876 --> 04:56.207
Oh, hello, Mrs. Crane.

04:56.278 --> 04:59.111
Won't you join us
for some nice hot coffee?

05:00.082 --> 05:02.141
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.

05:02.217 --> 05:04.777
This is the first time we've been away
from the farm in months.

05:04.853 --> 05:07.481
I promised Mrs. Preston
that we'd come over.

05:07.756 --> 05:09.246
Come on, boys.

05:11.293 --> 05:15.457
I make much better coffee
than that ranch mud you've been drinking.

05:15.530 --> 05:19.728
Go ahead. Have a nice, friendly cup
of coffee the way neighbors do.

05:32.214 --> 05:34.546
Won't you sit down, Mr. Starrett?

05:36.451 --> 05:37.475
You know something, Mrs. Crane?

05:37.552 --> 05:40.783
I'm glad your husband's stringing up
those barbed wire fences.

05:40.856 --> 05:43.620
We want more farmers around here
and less cattle.

05:43.692 --> 05:46.354
That's not a very friendly thing
to say, Ernine.

05:46.428 --> 05:48.191
Oh, I'm friendly enough all right.

05:48.263 --> 05:51.096
It's just that you and Blaise are
keeping me from getting married.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.895
I want a husband and not some ranch hand

05:52.968 --> 05:56.460
that makes $30 a month
with a bed in a bunkhouse.

05:56.538 --> 05:59.905
I want a young farmer
homesteading a quarter-section.

06:00.308 --> 06:02.173
Ernine, I'm afraid Mr. Starrett's
more concerned

06:02.244 --> 06:04.872
with keeping the range open
than in your getting a husband.

06:04.946 --> 06:07.380
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.246
Ernine, where'd you put the shortening?

06:09.317 --> 06:11.751
Oh, father!
Just when we were getting sociable!

06:11.820 --> 06:12.912
Excuse me.

06:19.194 --> 06:21.492
How's the winter at your place?

06:22.364 --> 06:25.265
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.

06:30.839 --> 06:32.773
Excuse me, Mrs. Crane.

06:32.841 --> 06:35.935
This coffee made me think
how good whiskey would taste.

06:36.011 --> 06:37.410
Excuse me.

06:37.646 --> 06:39.546
See you at the Wyoming.

06:54.262 --> 06:56.856
You want to tell me something, Helen?

07:02.170 --> 07:04.604
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.539
I want you to understand that
and believe it.

07:07.609 --> 07:08.837
I don't.

07:09.444 --> 07:10.502
Can't you see how wrong it was?

07:10.579 --> 07:11.637
I can see what's true.

07:11.713 --> 07:14.045
I don't care what's wrong or right.

07:14.116 --> 07:17.415
Loving you has made me
a stranger in my own family.

07:17.486 --> 07:20.785
It's made me feel cheap
every time Hal looks at me.

07:23.058 --> 07:25.083
It's not a nice feeling.

07:26.461 --> 07:27.621
It's better not to love at all.

07:27.696 --> 07:29.061
You met him first, you married him.

07:29.131 --> 07:31.599
Right now you can't even remember why.

07:31.666 --> 07:32.860
To spend the rest of your life with him,

07:32.934 --> 07:35.061
that would be the cheap thing to do.

07:35.137 --> 07:38.300
When Hal and I first came here,
you could have had me for the asking.

07:38.373 --> 07:40.933
I'd come to a new country
with a new husband.

07:41.009 --> 07:43.978
I would have given up anything
if you had only taken me then!

07:44.045 --> 07:45.672
I made a mistake.

07:46.581 --> 07:48.071
I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.

07:48.150 --> 07:50.618
I'm not proud I let you stay with him.

07:50.685 --> 07:52.710
I could have been stronger
and faithful with your help.

07:52.788 --> 07:55.621
I'm only concerned with
what's going to be.

07:55.957 --> 07:59.017
We're going to meet in town
once or twice a year.

07:59.094 --> 08:01.528
I'm going to call you Mr. Starrett

08:01.897 --> 08:04.058
and you're going to call me Mrs. Crane.

08:04.132 --> 08:05.997
That's what has to be.

08:06.201 --> 08:10.365
That's easy to say, not so easy to do.

08:12.407 --> 08:15.968
I was more lonely this winter
than I've ever been before.

08:16.912 --> 08:18.937
But I had time to think.

08:20.882 --> 08:23.680
I'm going to be Hal Crane's wife forever.

08:23.952 --> 08:26.546
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.053
Everything has to be
on Blaise Starrett's terms.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.183
You don't want the farmers
to fence their farms,

08:32.260 --> 08:34.421
you back your orders with guns!

08:34.496 --> 08:35.485
You want another man's wife,

08:35.563 --> 08:38.760
but the man has to be dead
before you'll take her!

08:40.534 --> 08:43.332
You don't have much mercy,
do you, Blaise?

08:44.806 --> 08:48.139
You won't find much mercy
anywhere in Wyoming.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.231
Funny weather we're having.

09:11.299 --> 09:12.459
That warm wind keeps blowing,

09:12.534 --> 09:14.934
the road'll be belly-deep in mud.

09:15.737 --> 09:17.602
You might have to stay in town
a few days.

09:17.672 --> 09:19.833
I wouldn't count on that.

09:20.876 --> 09:22.366
Say, George,

09:23.445 --> 09:25.413
my horse seems to be favoring
her left foreleg.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.914
Give it a good rubdown before
you turn in tonight, will you?

09:27.983 --> 09:30.781
You might not be needing
a horse tomorrow.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.762
He's coming.

10:00.348 --> 10:02.578
I see you bought the kerosene.

10:03.985 --> 10:06.317
Five gallons, like you ordered.

10:06.988 --> 10:09.115
We've been having a meeting.

10:09.824 --> 10:11.621
Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.

10:11.693 --> 10:13.024
It wasn't.

10:13.094 --> 10:15.324
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.

10:15.397 --> 10:18.662
We're not going to stand
for any gunplay in Bitters.

10:19.034 --> 10:20.899
I won't start it, Vic.

10:21.369 --> 10:24.395
I'd like that tin of kerosene back, Blaise.

10:28.576 --> 10:30.134
Didn't you pay for it?

10:30.211 --> 10:31.701
It's paid for.

10:31.846 --> 10:33.541
Take good care of it.

10:33.615 --> 10:36.709
I'd like to have a word
with you, Mr. Starrett.

10:38.887 --> 10:41.185
You must've passed my wagon
on your way in.

10:41.256 --> 10:43.349
- I did.
- Soon as the road's in shape,

10:43.425 --> 10:46.861
I'm moving that wire up to my place
and I'm stringing it up.

10:47.829 --> 10:50.127
That's what I thought it was for.

10:50.198 --> 10:52.632
What do you
intend to do about it?

10:53.802 --> 10:55.895
It's going to be cold
riding home tomorrow.

10:55.971 --> 10:58.030
I thought it would be nice
to stop and make a fire.

10:58.106 --> 11:00.836
I hear kerosene is the fastest way
to burn up a wagon.

11:00.909 --> 11:04.436
You burn my wagon, and I'II...
- Hal! Hal!

11:07.515 --> 11:08.777
Please...

11:10.085 --> 11:11.712
What do you
intend to do about it?

11:11.786 --> 11:14.346
I intend to go upstairs
and get a good night's sleep.

11:14.422 --> 11:16.652
I asked you a question, Mr. Starrett.

11:16.725 --> 11:18.625
When I wake up in the morning,
I'll know what to do.

11:18.693 --> 11:20.456
- I usually do.
- I've got to know!

11:20.528 --> 11:23.053
You want to know the future, Mr. Crane.

11:23.131 --> 11:26.032
That's wanting too much for any man.

11:26.701 --> 11:29.101
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.

11:30.705 --> 11:32.832
Mr. Starrett and I have
some business to discuss.

11:32.907 --> 11:35.034
Would you excuse us, please?

11:35.343 --> 11:38.608
I'm sure Mr. Starrett doesn't object
to my presence here.

11:38.747 --> 11:41.910
Mrs. Crane being with you
doesn't influence me.

11:42.183 --> 11:44.617
I'll fight for what I believe, Mr. Starrett.

11:44.686 --> 11:47.348
I'll die if I have to, but I'll fight.

11:47.422 --> 11:49.390
I want you to know that.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.090
You've got a big mouth, farmer.

11:54.462 --> 11:56.453
You've got big eyes, too.

11:57.732 --> 12:00.098
You came here a year ago
in your broken-down wagon

12:00.168 --> 12:02.693
looking for a choice spot to settle.

12:03.738 --> 12:05.831
And you think you found it.

12:06.708 --> 12:10.109
But you never stopped to think
what made it such a good place.

12:11.012 --> 12:14.106
When Dan and I came here,

12:14.182 --> 12:19.552
Bitters was a nesting spot
for every thief and killer in the territory.

12:19.621 --> 12:22.715
A man's life wasn't worth
the price of a bullet.

12:23.391 --> 12:24.688
No woman was safe in the streets,

12:24.759 --> 12:27.250
let alone in a lonely farm house!

12:28.530 --> 12:30.794
It took more than a big mouth
to get rid of the lice

12:30.865 --> 12:34.596
who infested every bend in the road
you ride so safely on.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.366
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone,

12:39.007 --> 12:41.305
but we did more than our share.

12:42.510 --> 12:44.273
We hunted them down in the freezing cold

12:44.345 --> 12:47.803
while you sat back in the East
hugging your pot-bellied stoves!

12:48.783 --> 12:50.182
Nobody thanked us,

12:50.251 --> 12:51.878
nobody paid us.

12:52.587 --> 12:56.353
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong!

12:57.425 --> 13:01.259
And all you've done is ride in here
and put down your stinking roots!

13:02.030 --> 13:05.193
And now you tell us
that you belong and we don't!

13:06.301 --> 13:10.795
Mr. Crane, you said you'd fight
to keep what you want.

13:11.940 --> 13:16.001
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years
and I intend to keep on doing it!

13:16.377 --> 13:20.177
And no pig-bellied farmer's
going to stop me!

13:46.407 --> 13:47.396
Give me a bottle, Tom.

14:11.566 --> 14:13.431
Don't kill my husband.

14:15.136 --> 14:16.626
He intends to kill me.

14:16.704 --> 14:19.036
Hal's never fired a pistol in his whole life.

14:19.107 --> 14:20.631
Then he shouldn't wear one.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.141
He's not a coward!

14:22.210 --> 14:24.235
He won't beg for his life.

14:24.546 --> 14:26.480
I'm not that courageous.

14:26.548 --> 14:28.015
I do beg you!

14:29.184 --> 14:31.175
You should be telling this to him.

14:31.252 --> 14:33.447
I have. He won't listen.

14:33.521 --> 14:35.648
What made you think I would?

14:36.257 --> 14:38.157
Do you want me, Blaise?

14:40.528 --> 14:43.725
Do you want me to ride out
to your ranch with you?

14:46.234 --> 14:50.000
I'm offering myself to you
on any terms you want,

14:50.071 --> 14:51.800
but leave Hal live.

14:52.807 --> 14:55.139
Your husband's a stubborn man.

14:55.343 --> 14:58.244
If he won't give up his fences,
why should he give you up?

14:58.313 --> 15:00.304
I'll tell him I no longer love him.

15:00.381 --> 15:02.042
He'll only come after you.

15:02.116 --> 15:05.017
It'll still have to end the same way.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.787
You're not a cruel man.

15:06.854 --> 15:09.084
I've been close enough to you to know.

15:09.157 --> 15:11.182
Why must you act like one?

15:12.160 --> 15:15.220
Because I can't feel sorry
for someone I hate.

15:18.399 --> 15:20.526
Do you hate me, too, Blaise?

15:41.089 --> 15:44.786
Tell your husband to load up his wagons
and take you out of Wyoming.

15:48.162 --> 15:50.027
Don't you think I've tried?

15:50.098 --> 15:51.998
I knew this was coming.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.964
I've waited all winter long for this day.

15:55.903 --> 15:57.461
You'll have to do it, Helen.

15:57.538 --> 15:59.438
Make him take you away.

15:59.507 --> 16:02.874
He's afraid of you,
but he's not a weak man.

16:02.944 --> 16:05.037
He'll die before he'll run!

16:12.053 --> 16:14.317
Then that's the way it'll have to be.

16:18.359 --> 16:21.760
I'm sorry to have troubled you,
Mr. Starrett.

18:21.249 --> 18:22.409
Dan?

18:27.255 --> 18:28.950
I'm no good to you, Blaise.

18:29.023 --> 18:30.820
I'm no good to you.

18:33.194 --> 18:34.991
Hold it!

18:35.062 --> 18:37.087
Don't touch that kerosene.

18:38.132 --> 18:40.032
We want you to go home.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.801
There are three of us.

18:58.085 --> 18:59.143
Dan.

19:00.788 --> 19:01.846
Dan!

19:04.559 --> 19:06.754
Roll the bottle down the bar.

19:08.362 --> 19:10.762
When it hits the floor, that's it.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.430
Roll the bottle, Dan!

19:39.961 --> 19:42.429
Anything we can do for you, strangers?

19:42.497 --> 19:44.089
Yes, could be.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.862
I was looking for a quiet place.

19:50.171 --> 19:52.833
We were settling a little private quarrel.

19:52.907 --> 19:54.898
I apologize.

19:55.276 --> 19:57.801
I don't like to break in on a party.

19:58.579 --> 20:00.376
But we'll take your guns.

20:00.882 --> 20:02.975
You won't find anything to take
in this town.

20:03.050 --> 20:05.211
You'd be surprised
at what we can find to take.

20:05.286 --> 20:07.413
The trail ends in this town.

20:07.622 --> 20:09.852
There's no place to go but back.

20:09.924 --> 20:12.017
The trail back is closed.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.923
Who's following you?

20:15.730 --> 20:16.754
Cavalry.

20:16.831 --> 20:19.129
Two days hard riding behind us.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.765
Cavalry doesn't bother tracking
seven men like you.

20:25.239 --> 20:29.767
Captain Jack Bruhn,
United States Army, formerly.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.274
Hey, you!

20:33.748 --> 20:36.239
I want food and service for my men!

20:36.317 --> 20:37.909
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.

20:37.985 --> 20:40.818
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.

20:41.689 --> 20:43.316
And my men rest?

20:51.866 --> 20:54.266
Now listen, do as you're told

20:54.335 --> 20:55.700
and you can go about your business

20:55.770 --> 20:58.170
just like we're not here, almost.

20:58.906 --> 21:02.808
But we are here, so it's best
you know with what you're dealing.

21:03.511 --> 21:06.776
Pace, here, he derives pleasure
out of hurting people.

21:07.615 --> 21:12.552
Tex, rile him and you're going to hear
some screaming in this town today.

21:13.321 --> 21:16.484
Denver, half-Cheyenne.

21:18.192 --> 21:19.955
Him hate white men.

21:20.027 --> 21:23.622
But he doesn't feel half so badly
about white women.

21:23.831 --> 21:27.460
Vause, bones covered with dirty skin,

21:27.535 --> 21:31.335
but even half-drunk, he's the fastest draw
in Wyoming Territory.

21:32.306 --> 21:33.773
And Shorty,

21:35.409 --> 21:37.377
we soldiered together.

21:39.246 --> 21:40.679
The young fella,

21:40.748 --> 21:43.012
well, he's a fresh recruit,
but he's learning fast.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.108
I believe you!

21:44.185 --> 21:46.710
You just killed a man for no reason!

21:48.089 --> 21:51.286
There will be no more killing,
and to make sure...

21:51.993 --> 21:53.654
Denver! Vause!

21:54.328 --> 21:57.491
Take that drunk
and round up every gun in town

21:58.799 --> 22:00.426
and destroy them!

22:02.403 --> 22:05.133
Don't waste time arguing with anybody.

22:06.774 --> 22:10.232
- How many people live around here?
- About 20.

22:10.811 --> 22:13.746
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.

22:15.049 --> 22:16.277
Not now.

22:17.418 --> 22:19.409
Let's get started, Bruhn.

22:19.487 --> 22:22.081
We can do whatever we want in this town.

22:22.156 --> 22:24.124
I'm edgy to get doing.

22:25.626 --> 22:28.527
Where do you hide
your women around here?

22:29.096 --> 22:31.064
Leave our women out of this!

22:31.132 --> 22:33.327
We only want to borrow them.

22:33.601 --> 22:35.091
We'll give them back.

22:37.838 --> 22:39.237
No women!

22:41.876 --> 22:44.276
And no whiskey, and no gunning.

22:46.113 --> 22:50.607
With $40,000 in gold in our saddlebags
and a long ride ahead?

22:53.554 --> 22:56.717
We'll pleasure ourselves
at the end of the trail.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.219
It's going to be a long day, Captain.

23:01.662 --> 23:03.630
You want to argue, Pace?

23:04.065 --> 23:05.157
No.

23:05.232 --> 23:06.961
Just reminding you.

23:07.535 --> 23:09.503
I got to have a drink.

23:11.138 --> 23:12.298
One.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.509
I'd like one,

23:16.577 --> 23:18.909
but it's the order of the day.

23:21.315 --> 23:23.340
Is there a doctor in this town?

23:23.417 --> 23:24.884
Doc Langer.

23:25.419 --> 23:28.115
A vet, back of the barber shop.

23:35.963 --> 23:38.932
Can this horse doctor
take out a bullet slug?

23:38.999 --> 23:40.227
He has.

23:52.046 --> 23:53.638
Freeze it, Pace!

23:56.484 --> 23:59.578
You seem to think a lot
of your women in this town.

23:59.653 --> 24:01.553
Who does she belong to?

24:04.158 --> 24:05.648
She's my wife.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.668
Change your mind
about no women, Captain?

24:18.739 --> 24:20.229
There are only four women in this town.

24:20.307 --> 24:23.105
Do you want your men
killing each other over them?

24:23.177 --> 24:24.337
Tex,

24:24.845 --> 24:26.779
Pace, search upstairs.

24:26.847 --> 24:29.338
Bring anybody you find down here.

24:33.888 --> 24:37.585
Shorty, take these two to the store.

24:37.658 --> 24:40.252
Then round up all the women
and put them in the store

24:40.327 --> 24:43.228
and tell them to get inside and stay inside.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.096
My wife is upstairs.

24:48.836 --> 24:51.236
My men won't molest your women

24:52.239 --> 24:53.797
unless I give them permission.

25:00.481 --> 25:02.142
We found one more.

25:02.516 --> 25:04.313
Get down here!

25:14.094 --> 25:17.552
Lady, you go to the store
with the rest of the women.

25:20.201 --> 25:21.259
Hey, you!

25:21.335 --> 25:25.396
I told you to prepare the rations.
Now get going.

25:33.647 --> 25:36.741
We've been riding hard
for over a month, Captain.

25:39.286 --> 25:40.344
Hey!

25:40.921 --> 25:43.515
Hide your liquor and hide it good.

25:49.463 --> 25:53.297
Now, let's go see that horse doctor.

25:57.538 --> 26:00.234
When the boys come back,
keep them here.

26:00.674 --> 26:03.404
No man leaves this saloon till I return.

26:04.612 --> 26:05.977
And no whiskey.

26:07.381 --> 26:08.973
That's an order.

26:10.584 --> 26:12.916
You handle your men well, Captain.

26:12.987 --> 26:14.454
They need me.

26:19.093 --> 26:20.822
Come along with me.

26:57.164 --> 26:59.394
That bullet's way in deep.
He lost a lot of blood.

26:59.466 --> 27:01.058
I don't see how he's still walking around.

27:01.135 --> 27:02.159
Has he got a chance?

27:02.236 --> 27:04.067
Well, if he was a horse,
or a calf, or a cow, I'd know.

27:04.138 --> 27:06.971
I just ain't had too much practice
on humans.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.941
It says here that a person
with a deep wound

27:09.009 --> 27:10.237
can die from the internal bleeding,

27:10.311 --> 27:12.404
even though nothing shows
on the outside.

27:12.479 --> 27:13.707
Is he bleeding internally?

27:13.781 --> 27:15.681
Well, I couldn't tell.

27:17.384 --> 27:19.477
Do you want me to kill him?

27:21.055 --> 27:22.317
Kill him?

27:23.757 --> 27:26.351
Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.

27:26.927 --> 27:28.121
You'll be the one they'll go after first!

27:28.195 --> 27:29.526
You've got to keep him alive!

27:29.596 --> 27:30.688
How?

27:30.764 --> 27:31.958
Look, I don't know how.

27:32.032 --> 27:33.795
I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.

27:33.867 --> 27:35.425
I wouldn't know how to use them
even if I did have them.

27:35.502 --> 27:37.663
- You're going to operate!
- But...

27:40.207 --> 27:42.607
What are you two talking about?

27:44.712 --> 27:47.943
The captain's waiting for you
to take the bullet out, Doc.

27:48.682 --> 27:50.843
He's waiting for the water to boil.

27:52.453 --> 27:55.047
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you!

28:21.715 --> 28:23.683
What are we waiting for?

28:24.184 --> 28:25.446
Sit down.

28:43.170 --> 28:45.365
You'd better have some of this.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.030
Put it away.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.134
Hide the liquor.

29:26.046 --> 29:27.536
Mr. Starrett,

29:28.115 --> 29:29.480
talk to me.

29:36.290 --> 29:37.655
What about?

29:38.859 --> 29:40.827
Anything, Mr. Starrett.

29:42.529 --> 29:43.791
Anything.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.481
Where did you serve
in the cavalry, Captain?

30:03.717 --> 30:05.241
Why do you ask?

30:06.920 --> 30:09.753
I remember hearing
about a Captain Bruhn.

30:10.757 --> 30:12.691
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.

30:12.759 --> 30:14.750
I just wondered if you were the same.

30:14.828 --> 30:16.853
Would you help me, please?

30:17.631 --> 30:19.326
What did you hear?

30:20.367 --> 30:21.459
No...

30:23.070 --> 30:24.799
It couldn't be you.

30:30.477 --> 30:31.967
Yes, it was.

30:50.197 --> 30:53.826
Strange how one word
could change a man's life.

30:55.702 --> 30:58.102
I could have ordered retreat.

31:00.140 --> 31:02.108
My command was, "Fire. "

31:25.832 --> 31:30.166
At West Point, I made up
my mind to be all soldier,

31:31.772 --> 31:35.674
which doesn't leave much room
for being human.

31:42.182 --> 31:43.444
Thanks.

32:30.530 --> 32:32.498
Keep your people in check.

32:32.566 --> 32:34.329
I'll control my men.

32:43.977 --> 32:47.310
Gene, you stay with me.

32:52.552 --> 32:54.543
I'm sleepy.

33:18.078 --> 33:20.103
What are his chances, Doc?

33:20.247 --> 33:21.771
I don't know.

33:22.983 --> 33:24.746
It was in real deep.

33:25.352 --> 33:28.082
I'd say if he lasts through the night...

33:28.889 --> 33:30.550
I just don't know!

33:43.970 --> 33:45.301
Shorty.

33:52.412 --> 33:54.107
I found a bottle in the barber shop.

33:54.181 --> 33:56.274
The captain says no whiskey.

33:56.350 --> 33:59.012
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.

33:59.886 --> 34:02.787
They'd have hung you back in Casper
if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn!

34:02.856 --> 34:05.450
And I'd have been an old bum in Abilene.

34:07.961 --> 34:10.862
I wish you hadn't
busted the bottle, Shorty.

34:11.297 --> 34:12.889
We could have had just one drink.

34:12.966 --> 34:16.197
Did you ever see what the captain does
to men who disobey?

34:18.438 --> 34:20.338
I've never seen anybody disobey him.

34:20.407 --> 34:21.498
I have.

34:21.574 --> 34:23.770
Be glad I busted that bottle.

34:26.646 --> 34:28.045
I'll get it.

34:30.283 --> 34:33.810
It's a relief to see you
and Mr. Starrett friendly again.

34:34.087 --> 34:36.317
Mr. Preston and I were so worried.

34:36.389 --> 34:39.052
That's all over, isn't it, Mr. Starrett?

34:39.126 --> 34:41.993
It doesn't seem very important right now.

34:42.661 --> 34:44.652
Hal and you could be good friends.

34:44.731 --> 34:46.960
Yes, we might try it sometime.

34:47.033 --> 34:50.092
What Blaise needs is a wife
to steady him down.

34:52.072 --> 34:53.266
Clagget stole a horse from them.

34:53.340 --> 34:55.672
He's just saddling up.
He's going to make a run for it!

34:55.742 --> 34:57.903
He's crazy! He'll never make it!

34:57.978 --> 34:59.707
He knows they're watching the road.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.645
Keep the women inside.

35:03.350 --> 35:04.408
Clagget!

35:04.484 --> 35:05.712
Stop it!

35:05.919 --> 35:07.386
My wife's alone at the farm!

35:07.454 --> 35:08.512
I've got to go to her.

35:08.588 --> 35:10.055
You can't get through.

35:10.123 --> 35:11.249
They've got a man watching the road.

35:11.324 --> 35:13.417
I'll get through.

36:25.131 --> 36:26.621
Bruhn is dying.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.429
I saw him a little while ago.

36:28.502 --> 36:30.402
He looked strong and healthy.

36:30.904 --> 36:32.701
He might not last the day.

36:32.772 --> 36:34.069
What'll happen if he dies?

36:34.140 --> 36:35.607
They'll start drinking and fighting.

36:35.675 --> 36:37.302
I've got to get Tommy out of that place.

36:37.377 --> 36:40.312
No, you can't help him. You better stay.

36:40.881 --> 36:43.315
They'll be here, too, soon enough.

36:43.383 --> 36:45.010
They mustn't find you here.

36:45.085 --> 36:46.609
Where could we hide in town?

36:46.686 --> 36:47.914
Beats me.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.548
Even if we had horses,
you couldn't get away through the snow.

36:50.624 --> 36:52.922
You ladies will have to walk.

37:00.534 --> 37:02.161
Get back to town.

37:04.404 --> 37:05.996
Get out of here.

37:08.308 --> 37:09.502
Gene.

37:10.410 --> 37:12.469
That's your name, isn't it?

37:12.546 --> 37:14.639
Don't make me use this gun.

37:15.415 --> 37:17.940
I don't think you ever shot anybody.

37:18.785 --> 37:20.480
I could start with you.

37:20.554 --> 37:22.181
What do you want?

37:23.023 --> 37:24.888
Let those women go by.

37:26.192 --> 37:27.784
I can't do that.

37:28.495 --> 37:32.158
They're coming. You going to shoot them?

37:32.299 --> 37:33.823
I can't cross Bruhn.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.492
- I've got to warn him.
- No!

37:36.202 --> 37:37.533
I don't think you want those women
to get hurt.

37:37.604 --> 37:40.198
I don't think Bruhn wants it, either.

37:40.373 --> 37:42.739
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You're going to do it for them?

38:00.860 --> 38:03.624
- Why didn't you stop them?
I was trying to.

38:13.406 --> 38:14.998
Go back to town.

38:39.866 --> 38:42.494
I told you
your women would be safe.

38:43.036 --> 38:45.334
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?

38:49.476 --> 38:52.309
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.

38:53.279 --> 38:56.043
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.812
Can we have some fun
with them now, Jack?

38:58.885 --> 39:00.147
The name is Bruhn!

39:00.220 --> 39:03.280
Ain't no reason to give them
a break now, Bruhn.

39:04.057 --> 39:06.651
I put my claim on that one first.

39:06.726 --> 39:09.422
I'm going to make the little one happy.

39:09.863 --> 39:12.161
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.

39:12.232 --> 39:13.460
Why not?

39:13.566 --> 39:16.467
They want to get drunk,
they want to have some fun!

39:19.539 --> 39:24.203
They could swallow this town whole
and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.

39:24.978 --> 39:27.003
You won't let that happen.

39:27.947 --> 39:29.539
Say the word, Captain.

39:29.616 --> 39:31.914
I'll toss you for the pleasure.

39:32.519 --> 39:34.851
Mr. Blaise, you broke your word.

39:35.121 --> 39:38.386
Only because I don't believe
you can hold your men.

39:40.727 --> 39:44.026
Tex, put down the gun.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.329
Go back to your homes, everybody.

39:49.402 --> 39:51.131
Stay on the inside.

39:56.176 --> 39:59.236
You, stay here!

40:08.988 --> 40:10.956
He's all yours, Texas.

40:11.024 --> 40:12.218
No gun.

40:49.095 --> 40:52.394
Thought you'd make yourself
a big man in this town, eh?

42:00.066 --> 42:01.055
Whoa!

42:05.371 --> 42:07.771
Vause, Denver,

42:08.675 --> 42:10.768
finish him.

42:13.713 --> 42:15.044
With your fists.

42:59.492 --> 43:02.723
Shorty, bring that boy.

43:04.130 --> 43:05.563
Come here, sonny.

43:05.632 --> 43:07.657
Why do you want my boy?

43:08.368 --> 43:10.097
He comes with me.

43:12.138 --> 43:13.901
Your friends will sacrifice you,

43:13.973 --> 43:18.672
but they won't cause a young boy
to be hurt by acting foolish.

43:48.641 --> 43:51.132
Don't worry about the boy.

43:51.210 --> 43:53.178
I'll take care of him.

43:53.913 --> 43:55.312
I promise.

43:56.449 --> 43:59.213
Now go on back, please.

44:24.310 --> 44:27.245
They'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.

44:28.314 --> 44:29.406
Sure.

44:30.950 --> 44:33.316
Bruhn seems to be getting better.

44:33.386 --> 44:35.980
They're staying close to the Wyoming.

44:36.589 --> 44:37.681
Good.

44:39.192 --> 44:41.683
Hal is grateful for what you did.

44:41.995 --> 44:43.587
Deeply grateful.

44:45.131 --> 44:46.655
Go back to him.

44:48.167 --> 44:50.294
I told him I was coming here.

44:50.370 --> 44:52.497
I asked him to come with me,

44:53.706 --> 44:55.901
but he told me to come alone.

44:59.379 --> 45:01.870
I believe he knows and understands.

45:03.416 --> 45:05.213
What's to understand?

45:06.252 --> 45:08.550
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.

45:10.356 --> 45:12.881
Go back to your husband, Mrs. Crane.

45:15.828 --> 45:17.489
Thank you, Blaise.

45:19.532 --> 45:21.523
Thanks for understanding.

45:33.146 --> 45:35.444
- You mustn't come in here, Ernine.
- I've got to see Bobby.

45:35.515 --> 45:38.575
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.

45:39.085 --> 45:41.645
Please, go home.

45:42.655 --> 45:44.555
I want to see Bobby first.

45:44.624 --> 45:46.717
Please don't! No, no!

45:51.330 --> 45:54.458
Say you'll do it or I'll break your little arm.

45:55.001 --> 45:56.434
No, no. Please don't...

45:56.502 --> 45:57.992
Let the kid go, Pace.

45:58.071 --> 45:59.163
Bruhn's got the whiskey hid.

45:59.238 --> 46:02.298
I want the kid to find out
where it is and get a bottle.

46:02.375 --> 46:03.967
You want a drink? Ask Bruhn.

46:04.043 --> 46:06.068
You giving orders now?

46:06.446 --> 46:08.175
In this case, I am.

46:26.265 --> 46:27.289
Forget it, Gene.

46:27.366 --> 46:30.995
We're all getting jumpy
from not having any liquor or fun.

46:32.805 --> 46:35.433
When he cools off, give him his gun back.

46:49.489 --> 46:51.457
Get out of here, Ernine.

46:51.657 --> 46:53.557
I'm taking him with me.

46:55.261 --> 46:56.353
Stop!

46:59.532 --> 47:01.261
I'm sorry. You can't do that.

47:01.334 --> 47:03.461
She hasn't done anything. Don't hurt her.

47:03.536 --> 47:05.766
I'm not going to hurt anybody.

47:06.506 --> 47:08.030
He's all right.

47:08.875 --> 47:11.366
He's as rotten as the rest of them.

47:11.811 --> 47:14.006
You shouldn't have come here.

47:14.847 --> 47:16.747
I'm taking Bobby back with me.

47:16.816 --> 47:18.807
That'll just make things worse.

47:18.885 --> 47:20.375
The boy's got to stay.

47:20.453 --> 47:22.944
I saw what happened,
I heard him screaming.

47:23.523 --> 47:26.151
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.

47:27.393 --> 47:29.588
There's no other way, Ernine.

47:40.907 --> 47:42.807
How do you do, miss?

47:47.046 --> 47:49.480
She was worried about her brother.

47:50.116 --> 47:51.606
She's leaving.

47:54.754 --> 47:56.346
No need to be.

47:56.889 --> 47:58.481
What's your name, miss?

47:58.558 --> 48:00.753
Bruhn said to leave
the women alone, Pace.

48:00.826 --> 48:03.818
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.

48:03.896 --> 48:05.591
That gives me certain privileges.

48:05.665 --> 48:07.132
Freeze, Pace!

48:23.849 --> 48:26.283
This sure is a night for tangling.

48:30.089 --> 48:31.852
I got a better idea.

48:32.892 --> 48:34.917
Let's toss a coin for her.

48:36.262 --> 48:37.422
Leave!

48:39.031 --> 48:41.431
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.

48:42.902 --> 48:45.336
Go ahead. I'll be all right.

48:59.051 --> 49:02.043
You didn't have to pull
that iron on me, Gene.

49:03.856 --> 49:05.448
I'm your friend.

49:06.626 --> 49:08.719
We ride together, don't we?

49:09.595 --> 49:10.960
Sure, Pace.

49:11.397 --> 49:13.126
We ride together.

49:13.332 --> 49:14.924
We're friends.

49:26.746 --> 49:29.010
Would you like a cup of coffee?

49:29.749 --> 49:30.773
Yeah, thanks.

49:39.925 --> 49:42.485
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc. How is he?

49:42.561 --> 49:44.028
Coming along.

49:49.101 --> 49:50.591
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?

49:50.670 --> 49:52.194
Not like dying?

49:53.205 --> 49:54.399
You don't want him to die, do you?

49:54.473 --> 49:56.202
No, of course not.

49:58.911 --> 50:00.776
He never answered you.

50:01.347 --> 50:03.008
I tell you, Tex,

50:07.153 --> 50:09.951
there's something
really wrong with Bruhn.

50:10.022 --> 50:11.284
There is?

50:14.026 --> 50:15.220
What?

50:15.594 --> 50:17.858
You sure look fine, Bruhn.

50:18.197 --> 50:19.391
Where's that little boy?

50:19.465 --> 50:21.524
In the kitchen with Gene.

50:22.935 --> 50:25.199
I don't want that boy harmed
or frightened.

50:25.271 --> 50:26.829
We all like the kid, Bruhn.

50:26.906 --> 50:28.840
I want the boy with Gene.

50:28.908 --> 50:30.375
Hey, Bruhn,
how about breaking open a bottle?

50:30.443 --> 50:32.673
Just one drink. I'm getting a chill.

50:32.745 --> 50:34.178
Just one drink.

50:34.780 --> 50:37.340
I want every man cold sober.

50:37.583 --> 50:39.710
We pull out of here at dawn.

50:46.792 --> 50:49.522
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.

50:49.595 --> 50:52.029
Did you see the weather coming in?

51:02.208 --> 51:04.608
My tongue's salt dry for whiskey.

51:06.178 --> 51:08.408
We took that Army pay wagon.

51:08.848 --> 51:10.076
We fought hard,

51:10.149 --> 51:11.878
shot our way out.

51:11.984 --> 51:13.576
For what?

51:13.819 --> 51:17.220
To sit around on our butts
like this was Sunday school?

51:24.163 --> 51:27.360
Captain, you ain't letting nature
take its course.

51:27.466 --> 51:30.196
Men don't act like you make us act here.

51:30.336 --> 51:31.633
We've got this town under our thumb

51:31.704 --> 51:33.194
but we ain't getting no pleasure out of it.

51:33.272 --> 51:36.935
Two more days like this
is going to seem like two more years.

51:37.009 --> 51:40.001
Maybe not even you
can keep us in line, Bruhn.

51:41.380 --> 51:44.008
I gave my word to the people of this town.

51:44.083 --> 51:45.243
Why did you?

51:45.317 --> 51:47.808
To make you look big and us little?

51:48.354 --> 51:50.652
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.

51:54.894 --> 51:56.225
You'll drink, fool around,

51:56.295 --> 51:58.855
then kill each other over these women.

51:59.832 --> 52:03.199
I'm a-riding out of here at daybreak
with six men.

52:04.303 --> 52:05.565
It's Saturday night.

52:05.638 --> 52:08.072
Invite the ladies over for a little social.

52:08.140 --> 52:11.303
There's no harm in coffee
and cookies and a little dancing.

52:11.377 --> 52:12.844
It'll take the edge off for a while.

52:12.912 --> 52:14.106
Yeah.

52:14.280 --> 52:17.477
And all I'd like is a chance
to talk to that little girl.

52:17.550 --> 52:20.815
I won't even ask her to dance
if she don't want to.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.889
With no liquor,
it'll be a quiet Saturday night.

52:23.956 --> 52:25.924
We need it bad, Captain.

52:30.229 --> 52:31.628
Very well.

52:55.754 --> 52:56.880
Tex!

53:24.250 --> 53:26.445
One dance and I get her back.

53:30.656 --> 53:33.181
If I was drunk,
I'd really show you how to dance.

53:33.259 --> 53:36.490
Maybe Bruhn'll open up the whiskey
pretty soon.

53:38.831 --> 53:40.696
I won't let Pace touch you.

53:40.766 --> 53:42.495
Are you any better?

53:44.870 --> 53:46.838
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

53:46.906 --> 53:48.533
No, you're right.

53:48.807 --> 53:51.207
I came with them, I'm one of them.

53:51.944 --> 53:55.812
I said I won't let Pace touch you,
but you don't have to dance with me.

53:56.015 --> 53:57.778
Don't leave me.

54:16.235 --> 54:18.226
Why don't we dance?

54:21.273 --> 54:23.468
I want to look at you.

54:39.191 --> 54:42.854
I think Tex has got to the point
where he can't stop.

55:09.388 --> 55:10.582
Tex!

55:14.526 --> 55:16.653
May I dance with the lady?

55:22.768 --> 55:23.894
Now.

55:54.233 --> 55:56.701
I'm going to get Bruhn one of these days.

55:56.769 --> 55:59.363
It's been tried by a lot of dead men.

56:05.444 --> 56:08.470
Why did you have to do this terrible thing?

56:10.616 --> 56:14.279
There are things worse, ma'am,
than dancing with lonely men.

56:16.889 --> 56:18.117
Please let us go.

56:18.190 --> 56:19.316
Soon.

56:22.995 --> 56:25.225
Why did you have to come here?

56:26.899 --> 56:28.799
You should be grateful.

56:29.101 --> 56:31.934
Our coming saved the life of your husband.

56:32.004 --> 56:35.496
I don't believe Blaise
would have gone through with it.

56:35.574 --> 56:39.066
Mrs. Crane,
when my men and I leave here,

56:39.144 --> 56:42.409
there will be a showdown
and you will be a widow.

56:44.216 --> 56:45.513
Shorty.

56:46.185 --> 56:47.447
Shorty!

57:09.041 --> 57:11.509
Having a good time, gentlemen?

57:11.577 --> 57:12.771
Yeah.

57:21.920 --> 57:23.888
How long can Bruhn live?

57:24.857 --> 57:27.417
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.

57:27.493 --> 57:30.394
It deadens pain,
makes the patient feel fine,

57:31.096 --> 57:33.394
but as soon as this dose wears off,
he's going to start coughing.

57:33.465 --> 57:36.730
Each cough's going to rip the lungs
a little bit more.

57:37.236 --> 57:40.603
A few hours after he starts coughing,
he's going to die.

58:02.427 --> 58:05.794
I didn't expect to hear music tonight.

58:06.031 --> 58:10.058
They took the women
to the saloon with them to dance.

58:11.804 --> 58:13.032
Dance?

58:17.476 --> 58:19.671
What are the men going to do about it?

58:19.745 --> 58:20.871
Nothing.

58:20.946 --> 58:22.413
Just talking.

58:23.782 --> 58:26.376
Crane was talking about
going to see Bruhn.

58:26.451 --> 58:29.614
If he does,
looks like you'll get what you wanted

58:29.688 --> 58:31.553
without doing a thing.

59:29.615 --> 59:31.640
Hold it! That's enough!

59:32.985 --> 59:34.919
Are you giving the orders now?

59:34.987 --> 59:36.011
No.

59:37.723 --> 59:41.250
You don't know anything about
the weather up in these mountains.

59:41.760 --> 59:45.093
It's storming up here
but not down in the valley below.

59:45.163 --> 59:47.893
You came here to talk about the weather?

59:48.600 --> 59:50.067
The soldiers you think
are days behind you

59:50.135 --> 59:51.363
are riding over the trail right now

59:51.436 --> 59:53.495
and they're heading this way.

59:53.939 --> 59:57.739
Your concern for my men and me,
Mr. Blaise, is very touching.

59:58.043 --> 01:00:00.739
Your position is hardly a tactical one.

01:00:01.213 --> 01:00:02.874
You can't fight it out
with those soldiers here.

01:00:02.948 --> 01:00:05.849
Even a private would realize that, Captain.

01:00:09.755 --> 01:00:11.950
Can you suggest an alternative?

01:00:12.024 --> 01:00:14.652
Yeah, if you stop this party.

01:00:14.927 --> 01:00:17.361
There's another way
through the mountains.

01:00:17.429 --> 01:00:20.125
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.

01:00:20.933 --> 01:00:22.400
I've been through it.

01:00:22.467 --> 01:00:23.832
He's lying.

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.198
Why didn't you take
your women that way this morning?

01:00:28.273 --> 01:00:30.571
It's too rough for the women.

01:00:31.276 --> 01:00:33.972
Might be too rough for some of your men.

01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:35.171
He's lying.

01:00:35.247 --> 01:00:37.545
I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:46.282
I'll find out.

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:49.860
You ride with us.

01:00:49.928 --> 01:00:51.395
Lead the way.

01:00:58.203 --> 01:01:00.535
You couldn't find it without me.

01:01:13.919 --> 01:01:17.719
Shorty, pack your gear
and assemble the men.

01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:20.087
We're moving out at daybreak.

01:01:21.193 --> 01:01:24.219
Gene, get the ladies out of here.

01:03:27.085 --> 01:03:29.280
Don't be frightened anymore.

01:03:29.654 --> 01:03:31.952
We'll be gone in a few minutes.

01:03:33.058 --> 01:03:34.821
Can I get you something?

01:03:34.893 --> 01:03:36.554
Some tobacco?

01:03:36.628 --> 01:03:38.596
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

01:03:41.933 --> 01:03:44.128
I'll always remember you.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:47.260
Goodbye, Gene.

01:03:49.241 --> 01:03:50.833
Goodbye, Ernine.

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:57.338
You mustn't go with them.

01:04:03.288 --> 01:04:04.778
I have to.

01:04:07.225 --> 01:04:09.318
I may come back later, but I have to.

01:04:09.394 --> 01:04:13.387
If you go, you'll never come back.
There is no way through that mountain.

01:04:52.938 --> 01:04:54.235
Blaise!

01:05:12.524 --> 01:05:14.754
There is no trail to Cheyenne.

01:05:15.026 --> 01:05:17.324
I never said there was a trail.

01:05:17.729 --> 01:05:19.822
I said there was a way through.

01:05:19.898 --> 01:05:22.128
Stop maneuvering, there's no way.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.462
Kill him.

01:05:23.702 --> 01:05:25.067
Wait, Gene!

01:05:34.646 --> 01:05:37.308
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.

01:05:37.382 --> 01:05:38.906
I'm not interested.

01:05:38.984 --> 01:05:41.111
You're a dying man, Bruhn.

01:05:41.519 --> 01:05:43.180
That interest you?

01:05:43.288 --> 01:05:45.279
How do you want to die?

01:05:46.591 --> 01:05:48.786
You're a man, not an animal.

01:05:49.894 --> 01:05:52.419
You can ride out of here
with me and die clean,

01:05:52.497 --> 01:05:53.987
or you can turn your men loose
in this town

01:05:54.065 --> 01:05:56.295
and die like a pig in the mud.

01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:59.260
Do you want another Mormon massacre?

01:06:08.179 --> 01:06:10.374
How do you want to go, Bruhn?

01:06:16.321 --> 01:06:18.255
Ernine told you there was no trail.

01:06:18.323 --> 01:06:19.517
I didn't say who told me.

01:06:19.591 --> 01:06:20.956
Ernine must like you.

01:06:21.026 --> 01:06:23.790
Have you any idea
what Pace'll do to her when Bruhn dies?

01:06:23.862 --> 01:06:25.659
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.823
I won't be here to help you, son.

01:06:40.178 --> 01:06:41.668
Just a minute.

01:06:43.315 --> 01:06:45.180
I know what I'm doing

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.980
and I know what Gene's doing.

01:06:48.386 --> 01:06:50.013
But you...

01:06:50.422 --> 01:06:52.686
What's your reason?
Why do you want to die?

01:06:52.757 --> 01:06:55.282
I know what I'm doing, too, Bruhn.

01:06:57.696 --> 01:06:59.596
Let's leave it at that.

01:07:01.232 --> 01:07:03.632
I guess every fool has his reason.

01:07:39.003 --> 01:07:40.561
Ernine spoke the truth.

01:07:40.638 --> 01:07:42.230
There is no way across the mountain.

01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:43.638
Who knows?

01:07:45.009 --> 01:07:46.977
Maybe I'll find a trail.

01:07:47.345 --> 01:07:49.677
I'm not even sure they're going.

01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:52.549
But if they do go,
you know you won't come back.

01:07:52.617 --> 01:07:54.084
Probably not.

01:07:57.021 --> 01:07:58.648
Why are you doing this?

01:07:58.723 --> 01:08:00.987
I'm not doing anything special.

01:08:01.059 --> 01:08:03.755
Just taking some bad men
out of a good town.

01:08:03.828 --> 01:08:07.127
You're the same man
who would have killed Hal.

01:08:07.532 --> 01:08:09.693
I don't know you at all.

01:08:09.901 --> 01:08:11.368
No reason to.

01:08:14.439 --> 01:08:16.737
Are you doing it because of me?

01:08:17.776 --> 01:08:19.937
I'd like to know, Blaise.

01:08:20.145 --> 01:08:22.443
I'm doing it because of myself.

01:08:22.514 --> 01:08:23.707
That night in my room in the Wyoming,

01:08:23.782 --> 01:08:26.216
when you asked me
not to kill your husband,

01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:28.411
after you left,
I took a good look at myself in the mirror.

01:08:28.486 --> 01:08:30.477
I didn't like what I saw.

01:08:30.721 --> 01:08:32.587
That doesn't make me any different
from the men who rode in

01:08:32.657 --> 01:08:34.420
and took over this town.

01:08:34.492 --> 01:08:37.654
Only they don't pretend
to be anything but what they are.

01:08:41.765 --> 01:08:44.701
And that's all there is to it, Mrs. Crane.

01:09:20.037 --> 01:09:21.505
Let's move.

01:11:21.359 --> 01:11:24.226
Well, I feel better now.

01:11:26.297 --> 01:11:29.232
I'm beginning to hope
we're going to make it.

01:11:31.336 --> 01:11:33.429
None of us are going to make it.

01:13:14.706 --> 01:13:16.071
Hey, Blaise!

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.540
How are we going to get out of this?

01:14:14.332 --> 01:14:16.664
I'm going to need me another horse.

01:14:17.401 --> 01:14:19.494
Ride one of the packhorses.

01:14:26.444 --> 01:14:27.638
Gene,

01:14:28.513 --> 01:14:30.242
get off your horse.

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:41.554
Bruhn said get down.

01:14:44.729 --> 01:14:48.028
And I'm saying leave your saddle bags
where they are.

01:14:48.099 --> 01:14:49.726
There's $6,000 in gold in them.

01:14:49.801 --> 01:14:51.029
You can't carry it anyway.

01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:52.364
Get down.

01:14:57.241 --> 01:14:59.141
Just follow the tracks.

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:00.905
If snow covers them,
keep the wind at your back.

01:15:00.978 --> 01:15:02.741
You'll be all right.

01:15:03.147 --> 01:15:04.239
Down!

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:22.724
Hey!

01:15:24.368 --> 01:15:26.598
You won't be needing that gun.

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:35.608
We're both giving this party, Mr. Blaise.

01:15:36.113 --> 01:15:37.603
Move out, son.

01:15:49.393 --> 01:15:52.021
Say hello to the soldiers for us, kid.

01:15:52.096 --> 01:15:53.495
Let's ride!

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:42.103
Captain Bruhn, Captain Bruhn,
what's wrong?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.331
Hey, Starrett, help me!

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.344
Hold it!

01:17:57.421 --> 01:18:01.050
We have to stop here
till the captain can ride again.

01:18:02.693 --> 01:18:03.921
We're not stopping.

01:18:25.683 --> 01:18:27.344
Get on your horse.

01:18:34.558 --> 01:18:38.358
Thanks, Captain Bruhn.

01:18:38.829 --> 01:18:41.559
What're you thanking him for?
Get on your horse!

01:18:46.771 --> 01:18:49.205
I don't think you want to kill me.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:57.941
We got to have Blaise, Tex.

01:19:00.785 --> 01:19:03.618
We're going to stop
and bury these two men.

01:19:29.447 --> 01:19:32.439
You know, it's kind of a lucky ride after all.

01:19:32.616 --> 01:19:33.981
Lucky?

01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:35.109
Yeah.

01:19:35.186 --> 01:19:38.280
We started out with about
$6,000 in gold apiece.

01:19:39.557 --> 01:19:42.720
Now we've got $18,000 more
to split four ways.

01:19:44.328 --> 01:19:45.727
Cheyenne,

01:19:46.897 --> 01:19:48.956
here I come.

01:19:54.738 --> 01:19:56.638
Cheyenne, here we come.

01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:19.452
What are you looking for?

01:20:24.301 --> 01:20:25.962
You see anything?

01:20:27.138 --> 01:20:28.400
Not much.

01:20:32.042 --> 01:20:34.067
There's nothing to see.

01:20:37.848 --> 01:20:40.180
You know where you're taking us?

01:20:44.855 --> 01:20:45.913
Yes.

01:20:47.658 --> 01:20:49.751
You lie, you know it!

01:20:51.295 --> 01:20:52.728
I know it!

01:20:54.031 --> 01:20:55.794
Turn around and go back to camp.

01:20:55.866 --> 01:20:59.029
I'll show you what a Cheyenne does
with a liar!

01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:28.255
Get up, you're not hurt.

01:21:56.994 --> 01:21:59.690
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.

01:22:01.532 --> 01:22:02.897
Let's ride!

01:22:29.159 --> 01:22:30.148
Saddle.

01:23:18.509 --> 01:23:19.737
Come on.

01:23:27.818 --> 01:23:29.342
Come on.

01:23:42.399 --> 01:23:44.731
Come on back here, come on back.

01:24:12.363 --> 01:24:14.558
Not much shelter.

01:25:04.148 --> 01:25:05.513
Stop him!

01:25:05.582 --> 01:25:07.049
Stop him, Tex!

01:25:11.822 --> 01:25:14.222
Now we have to go out
and bring him back.

01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:15.315
We need him!

01:25:15.392 --> 01:25:17.451
I just shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.

01:25:17.528 --> 01:25:19.962
Now let's get this fire started.

01:25:22.199 --> 01:25:24.099
We've got the horses,
the grub and the guns.

01:25:24.168 --> 01:25:26.193
He can't live out there.

01:25:36.847 --> 01:25:38.178
Damn wind!

01:25:38.549 --> 01:25:39.880
The horses can't stand it, either.

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:42.384
Now let's get this fire started.

01:25:50.427 --> 01:25:52.190
What are you doing?

01:26:31.368 --> 01:26:33.768
I don't have any matches.

01:26:35.272 --> 01:26:37.137
I don't have any matches.

01:26:37.207 --> 01:26:38.674
No matches.

01:31:12.315 --> 01:31:14.374
Welcome home, Mr. Starrett.

01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:23.726
Wait a minute.

01:31:23.794 --> 01:31:26.991
I thought it best he stay here
while the soldiers will be around.

01:31:27.063 --> 01:31:30.226
I'd like to work for you, Mr. Starrett,
if you'll have me.

01:31:32.936 --> 01:31:34.631
All right, Gene.

01:31:35.205 --> 01:31:38.231
Then you won't need this.
