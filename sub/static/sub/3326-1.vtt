00:01.043 --> 00:02.169
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.378 --> 00:04.744
Are you sure
that this is a girl and not an animal?

00:04.964 --> 00:06.044
Malia?

00:08.551 --> 00:10.132
Was that your first kiss?

00:10.595 --> 00:11.926
- Are you scared?
- Not right now.

00:12.388 --> 00:13.252
You're the one
who saved Isaac.

00:13.473 --> 00:14.838
I'm the one who was
hired to save Isaac.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.221
You have no idea
what you are.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.552
A Banshee.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.269
It means that she can sense
when someone's close to death.

00:19.479 --> 00:20.719
Allison!

00:24.108 --> 00:25.518
Where is the She-Wolf?

00:25.735 --> 00:27.225
We don't know any She-Wolf.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.981
- Who's this?
- That's my dad's sister, Kate.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.186
Can you get turned
by a scratch?

00:30.907 --> 00:32.272
If the claws
go deep enough.

00:32.617 --> 00:33.481
You're real.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.192
And if seeing me
is a surprise, watch this.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.521
- This doesn't seem so bad.
- It's not the town, it's the plan.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.526
- What's wrong with the plan?
- Stiles.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.698
This could be the stupidest plan
we've ever come up with.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.201
- You're aware of that, right?
- I'm aware it's not our best.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.695
We are going to die.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.661
Are you saying that as a Banshee
or you're just being pessimistic?

01:24.919 --> 01:28.082
I'm saying it as a person
who doesn't wanna die.

01:28.965 --> 01:31.547
Okay. Would you just mind
restricting any talk of death

01:31.759 --> 01:33.545
to actual Banshee predictions?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.001
This plan is stupid
and we're going to die.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.049
- Oh, thank you.
-Mmm.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.023
No. On the house.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.150
Most American teenagers don't cross
the border to refuse a drink.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.151
We didn't come to drink.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.464
Severo hates this music.

04:18.884 --> 04:19.873
Me?

04:20.636 --> 04:22.718
I've always loved
the music of youth.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.970
This kind, especially.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.722
It has a savage energy.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.762
We're here for Derek Hale.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.097
Is that so?

04:31.355 --> 04:32.219
We know you have him.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.689
We've heard you can be bought.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.191
It's 50,000 for Derek.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.067
Now,

04:48.622 --> 04:52.160
where does a teenage boy
get money like this?

04:53.753 --> 04:55.243
Japanese mafia?

05:03.721 --> 05:05.382
Not smart to come alone.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.677
What makes you think we came alone?

05:27.077 --> 05:29.159
You brought a wolf into my home?

05:31.749 --> 05:33.455
We brought an Alpha.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.302
Something's happening.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.553
I know.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.725
- What do we do?
- Blend in!

06:40.442 --> 06:41.943
Dance with me, dumbass.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.691
Oh.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.525
My friends...

08:11.116 --> 08:14.153
I don't think you're aware
of your poor timing.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.111
Do you know
what the dark moon is?

08:17.748 --> 08:20.831
The part of the lunar phase
when the moon is least visible in the sky.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.829
But do you know its meaning?

08:24.213 --> 08:28.081
Some people say it's a time of reflection.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.086
Or grief.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.801
Grief and loss, mija.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.388
I wonder why,

08:37.685 --> 08:40.848
when you and your friends
have suffered so much loss,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.980
you would risk it again
for someone like Derek Hale.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.687
'Cause we don't like to lose.

08:49.738 --> 08:50.989
Front door clear.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.108
South clear.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.405
Noﬂh?

09:06.130 --> 09:07.085
Stiles.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.046
Take 10 off the table.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.715
Maybe you should just take the deal.

09:21.437 --> 09:25.555
While I'm keen to follow
the warning of a Banshee,

09:25.983 --> 09:28.065
I'm going to have to decline.

09:46.879 --> 09:47.789
Ready?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.642
All right. Come on.
Just give us Derek.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.522
You don't want him anyway.

10:51.735 --> 10:52.975
Haven't you noticed
what a downer he is?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.902
No sense of humor,
poor conversationalist.

10:56.115 --> 10:57.821
Just come on,
take the money.

11:01.745 --> 11:02.700
Severo?

11:03.247 --> 11:05.704
Show them how
the Calaveras negotiate.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.195
Wolfsbane. It's wolfsbane!

11:38.407 --> 11:39.362
Kira... Kira, get out of here!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.282
Kira, look out, look out!

11:53.589 --> 11:56.547
Someone who has been
an Alpha only a few months

11:56.758 --> 12:00.626
should be more careful
when facing a hunter of 40 years.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.546
All we want is Derek.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.301
My lobito,

12:06.059 --> 12:08.141
you're a long way from home.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.900
You don't know
where he is either.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.417
Okay. So how long
has it been?

12:35.005 --> 12:36.961
Weeks. He hasn't
gotten back to any of my texts.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.456
Has Derek ever
returned your texts?

12:38.634 --> 12:39.794
Once. Definitely once.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.545
But this time it felt different.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.002
So I went to the loft.
The alarm was on.

12:43.222 --> 12:44.302
Everything looked okay.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.930
But then I found these.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.262
So I sent a picture of it to Deaton.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.315
He said that it's the mark of a family of
hunters based out of Mexico.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.100
The Calaveras.

12:58.362 --> 12:59.317
What would they want
with Derek?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.154
You don't think
they killed him, do you?

13:02.783 --> 13:03.772
I don't know.

13:06.745 --> 13:07.700
That's why you're here.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.533
Lydia, what?
Is he dead?

13:54.459 --> 13:55.414
No.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.795
But I'm not sure he's alive either.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.832
What does that mean?

14:05.637 --> 14:06.547
I don't know.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.344
There's something
not right. I just...

14:13.395 --> 14:14.475
I don't know.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.681
So if the Calaveras have him,
how do we find them?

14:24.740 --> 14:25.820
Mexico.

14:31.872 --> 14:32.782
Hey.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.368
He's awake.
Guys, he's awake.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.244
Scott, you okay?

14:41.298 --> 14:42.378
Yeah.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.589
They don't have him.
They don't have Derek.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.502
We know. But right now,
they've got Lydia.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.716
Lydia?
What do they want with Lydia?

14:52.601 --> 14:53.932
l have to admit

14:54.561 --> 14:56.927
I don't have much experience
with Banshees.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.186
That makes two of us,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.811
since I don't have much
experience being one.

15:03.862 --> 15:07.070
l have a feeling
you underestimate your abilities, Lydia.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.566
Trust me,

15:11.370 --> 15:13.452
you'd have better luck
with tarot cards.

15:14.664 --> 15:15.699
Let's find out.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.705
Tell me,

15:19.753 --> 15:22.460
which one of these men
is about to die?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.562
We already looked for a way out.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.353
I think a lot of people have.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.732
I say when
that door opens again,

15:48.949 --> 15:51.486
we take out whoever's
standing in the way and run for it.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.157
- What about Lydia?
- What about her?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.694
We're not leaving without her.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.408
Why not?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.286
Because we don't leave
without people.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.582
Remember, we talked
about this?

16:01.753 --> 16:04.586
Rules of the wild kingdom
don't apply to friends.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.041
Is that what
you would do as a coyote,

16:06.258 --> 16:07.293
leave her for dead?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.708
If she was weak
and injured, yeah.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.793
If hunting had been
bad that season, I would eat her.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.379
Then I'd leave.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.590
Mmm. Believe it or not,
that's progress.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.269
All right, guys,
we're not dead yet.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.854
And that means
Araya wants something.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.724
But if the Calaveras
don't know where Derek is,

16:21.940 --> 16:23.680
that means they didn't
take him from the loft. Right?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.057
Maybe he left on his own.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.396
Maybe someone else got to him.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.196
How does it work?

16:32.742 --> 16:33.993
Do you need to touch them?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.704
Maybe I give you
something they own.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.909
Or is it just a... a feeling?

16:42.335 --> 16:45.202
I told you I don't know.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.674
Just how close to death
do they have to be?

17:07.736 --> 17:08.771
What did you do that for?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.818
He stole from me.

17:14.826 --> 17:15.815
What do you want?

17:16.411 --> 17:17.321
Right now?

17:18.622 --> 17:20.829
I want to know about Scott McCall.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.244
I want to know

17:23.460 --> 17:26.167
what kind of Alpha he really is.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.726
Oh, God.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.687
Let her go.
Look. You've got me.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.265
Just let the others go.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.948
Your hand goes here.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.120
So, let me explain
what's about to happen.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.076
This one, the fox,

18:05.377 --> 18:06.833
has an immunity to electricity.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.625
So she's going to turn
the dial on the Alpha.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.093
If she doesn't,

18:14.511 --> 18:16.547
I turn the dial
on the Banshee.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.469
No. I'm not doing this.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.931
Are you sure?

18:24.938 --> 18:27.680
One of your friends
has the power to heal.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.356
The other?

18:30.735 --> 18:32.020
Not so much.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.437
What are you doing?
Is this a game to you?

18:35.657 --> 18:37.443
This is a test, lobito.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.698
Let's see if you pass.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.781
We're going to ask
some questions.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.537
You answer them, nobody gets hurt.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.613
You don't answer,

18:45.834 --> 18:47.370
we turn on the dial.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.378
Do what they say.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.422
Okay? Whatever they want.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.837
I can take it.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.298
So...

18:59.764 --> 19:01.595
We don't know where Derek is.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.719
We want to find him as well.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.764
You know who took him.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.477
What?

19:09.399 --> 19:10.479
How would I know that?

19:10.692 --> 19:12.603
That doesn't sound
like an answer to me.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.232
We don't know.
Why do you think we came here?

19:18.742 --> 19:21.154
Kira, turn the dial.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.533
Should we turn the dial
on Lydia instead?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.205
No, no!

19:28.418 --> 19:29.703
Do it, Kira.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.580
Do it.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.630
Let's start at one.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.229
Do you hear them?
Can you hear Scott?

19:59.324 --> 20:01.485
Okay, okay.
Can you hear Kira, Lydia, anybody?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.407
What are they saying?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.406
I... I can't.
I can't concentrate. I...

20:05.622 --> 20:08.705
There's too many
sounds and voices.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.536
Okay. It's okay.
Well, just breathe.

20:11.753 --> 20:12.913
Breathe with me, all right?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.960
You practiced this
with Scott before, remember that?

20:15.173 --> 20:16.162
I'm trying.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.419
It's okay, it's okay.
Just focus on something.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.966
Here, look at my eyes.
Very good.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.338
Just focus on the sound of my voice.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.543
Anything you have to do.
Just try to concentrate.

20:22.764 --> 20:23.719
Concentrate...

20:36.736 --> 20:37.521
Tell me!

20:37.737 --> 20:39.523
Who actually has Derek?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.855
Who had a reason, a vendetta

20:42.033 --> 20:44.274
particular to the Hales?

20:44.661 --> 20:46.447
I said I don't know.

20:46.663 --> 20:47.527
Oh, you don't know

20:47.747 --> 20:49.658
because you haven't figured it out yet.

20:49.874 --> 20:50.954
So think!

20:51.501 --> 20:53.037
Who could've taken him?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.913
Tres.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.464
It's okay. It's okay.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.599
Who had the power?

21:10.812 --> 21:12.518
The power of a shapeshifter?

21:12.731 --> 21:15.313
I don't know.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.981
Oh!

21:17.152 --> 21:19.939
Someone who could
have turned without you knowing.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.229
Turned, but not by a bite!

21:23.324 --> 21:24.359
I don't know!

21:30.749 --> 21:31.704
Diez!

21:38.965 --> 21:40.705
They're killing him.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.010
Can you get turned by a scratch?

21:54.439 --> 21:55.929
If the claws go deep enough.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.694
Say the name, Scott.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.533
Kate.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.159
No. That's impossible.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.123
It's impossible.
That can't be what he said.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.701
Why? Who... Who's Kate?

22:19.756 --> 22:21.087
She's a hunter.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.589
An Argent.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.873
So you're just letting us go?

22:57.168 --> 23:00.706
I sent four men out to where Kate was
rumored to have been seen.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.212
None of them came back.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.416
Let's see if you can do better.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.176
You could've just
told me she was alive.

23:09.848 --> 23:11.463
You wouldn't have believed me.

23:12.934 --> 23:16.176
Now I know what kind
of Alpha you are.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.392
And where your next step lies.

23:21.276 --> 23:22.482
What next step?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.313
When you take
the bite of an innocent,

23:25.613 --> 23:27.444
when you make
a wolf of your own,

23:27.657 --> 23:28.692
when you do that,

23:29.617 --> 23:32.529
then, I will cross your border

23:32.745 --> 23:35.327
and come knocking at your door.

23:44.549 --> 23:45.629
So what now?

23:45.842 --> 23:47.798
She thinks she knows
where we can find Derek.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.462
She gonna tell us where?

23:49.679 --> 23:52.091
Uh, actually,
she's giving us a guide.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.476
You know her?

24:06.988 --> 24:07.898
Braeden.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.355
Who's Braeden?

24:10.575 --> 24:11.485
She's a mercenary.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.155
Right now, I'm the only one
who's gonna take you to la iglesia.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.077
The Church?

24:16.247 --> 24:17.407
What's The Church?

24:18.124 --> 24:20.490
It's not a place you'll find God.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.359
Okay, I'll ask.

24:48.571 --> 24:49.686
Who's Kate Argent?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.530
Uh, I'd like to know, too.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.108
Well, we were at her funeral.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.527
So, I'd like to know how
she got out of a casket

24:57.747 --> 24:59.703
that was buried
six feet underground.

24:59.999 --> 25:00.988
She was never in it.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.873
She was Allison's aunt.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.830
And a total sociopath.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.545
You don't have to talk about it now
if you don't want to.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.551
Um, yes, he does.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.559
Yeah, she's right.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.682
You guys should know.
You need to know.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.402
All right.
Kate was the one who set the fire

25:28.611 --> 25:29.851
that killed most of Derek's family.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.950
Some of them survived,
like Cora, and Peter.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.660
A very angry Peter.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.538
Yeah, he's the one
who bit and turned me.

25:45.753 --> 25:48.790
And the one who finally caught up
to Kate and killed her.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.718
And we saw her buried.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.422
No. We saw a casket, remember?

25:59.767 --> 26:00.677
She wasn't in it.

26:06.149 --> 26:07.764
The Calaveras heard
that Kate had been killed

26:07.984 --> 26:09.565
by an Alpha '5 claws.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.689
They wanted to make sure
she was really dead.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.703
Her body was healing.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.292
More and more,
as she got closer to a full moon.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.536
She was coming back.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.539
So they switched out the bodies.

26:28.755 --> 26:29.710
They took her.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.544
If a hunter is bit,
they have to take their own life

26:33.760 --> 26:34.920
before they change.

26:43.895 --> 26:47.683
The Calaveras,
they treat the code like law.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.558
They make it
their responsibility to enforce it.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.694
Good for her.
I wouldn't do it either.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.788
Would you kill half
a dozen people to get out?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.410
Because that's what she did.

27:31.734 --> 27:33.690
So Kate's a werewolf now?

27:34.529 --> 27:35.860
I don't know.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.153
You know, there's a saying,

27:38.366 --> 27:39.651
sometimes the shape you take

27:39.867 --> 27:41.243
reflects the person you are.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.114
What kind of shape
is sociopathic bitch?

27:57.385 --> 27:58.295
What happened?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.548
I don't know.
It felt like we hit something.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.927
Scott, we need to get there by
night. It's too dangerous otherwise.

28:09.730 --> 28:10.685
Go.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.471
Not without you.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.182
Dude, someone needs to find Derek.

28:14.402 --> 28:17.360
We'll figure something out.
We always do. Just go.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.278
Okay.

28:24.745 --> 28:25.780
Scott...

28:26.747 --> 28:30.035
I can't think of anything else to say
except for be careful.

28:30.668 --> 28:32.533
And I know "be careful"
sounds kind of lame

28:32.753 --> 28:34.539
and I'm totally sure
the second you're gone

28:34.755 --> 28:37.883
I'm gonna think
of something much better, but I...

28:39.886 --> 28:42.093
No, "be careful" works for me.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.686
Scott, the sun's going down.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.641
Hey, I gotta go.

29:21.469 --> 29:22.379
Stiles.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.721
I don't think
we hit something.

29:28.226 --> 29:30.137
I think something hit us.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.633
La iglesia.

30:10.226 --> 30:11.136
What happened here?

30:12.061 --> 30:14.768
An earthquake.
It leveled the town.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.438
Then why is The Church still standing?

30:17.984 --> 30:21.272
The locals think
it's because of what's underneath.

30:21.529 --> 30:22.939
Do I wanna know?

30:23.739 --> 30:26.526
The Church was built over
the ruins of an Aztec temple.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.529
It belonged to a people
called the nagual.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.281
Shapeshifters?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.620
Were-jaguars.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.541
So Derek and Kate
are somewhere in there?

30:42.758 --> 30:44.043
I don't know.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.292
Never gotten this far before.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.219
Maybe we should just walk.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.395
Hey, I will never abandon this jeep.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.689
You understand me?
Ever. Ever.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.523
Work faster, Stiles.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.781
There's something out here with us.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.308
If you find Kate in here,
what are you gonna do with her?

31:39.774 --> 31:42.060
Bring her back to the Calaveras.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.692
That's what they paid me for.

31:47.198 --> 31:48.654
What happens after that?

31:48.866 --> 31:50.402
Not my problem.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.659
- You don't care?
- Do you?

31:53.871 --> 31:55.702
She's a mass murderer.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.663
And you're a mercenary.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.377
Girl's gotta eat.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.035
If you were paid enough,
would you kill her?

32:02.671 --> 32:05.162
If the money was good, I'd kill you.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.556
Can you catch
Derek's scent?

32:20.731 --> 32:21.811
Yeah.
Already on it.

32:27.655 --> 32:28.690
What?

32:29.740 --> 32:31.856
There's something else in here.

32:32.076 --> 32:33.566
Something like what?

32:33.744 --> 32:35.359
Something not human.

32:45.172 --> 32:48.255
Lydia, could you
please hold the light still for a second?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.708
It's really hard to see anything
if you keep shaking it like that.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.135
I'm shaking it like this because
we're in the middle of nowhere

32:53.347 --> 32:54.302
with your broken down jeep

32:54.515 --> 32:57.757
and we're being attacked by yet another
razor-clawed monster.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.220
And I'm terrified.

32:59.562 --> 33:00.802
Well, just be slightly less terrified.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.691
And hold this.

33:05.568 --> 33:06.523
What's this?

33:06.735 --> 33:09.021
I don't know. I'm hoping
it's not important.

33:09.447 --> 33:10.687
Oh, God.

33:11.115 --> 33:12.025
Anything?

33:13.451 --> 33:14.691
It's too hard to see.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.700
We should've brought
another flashlight.

33:34.763 --> 33:35.843
Did you see that?

33:39.351 --> 33:40.477
Malia, wait!

33:40.686 --> 33:41.596
Hey, Malia!

33:42.438 --> 33:44.520
Kira, go!
You. Fix the jeep.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.056
Stiles, focus!

34:12.301 --> 34:13.461
Malia?

34:23.437 --> 34:24.426
It's me!

34:24.855 --> 34:26.470
Uh, it's me, it's me.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.848
What happened?
What's out there?

34:30.319 --> 34:32.685
I don't know,
but it is big and fast.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.687
And it cuts deep.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.378
So, how come
you didn't kiss her?

34:52.174 --> 34:53.084
What?

34:53.801 --> 34:55.132
How come
you didn't kiss your girlfriend?

34:56.136 --> 34:57.046
You mean Kira?

34:57.680 --> 34:58.635
Whatever her name is.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.388
Well, she's not really, uh...

35:02.643 --> 35:03.758
I mean,
we've never actually...

35:05.729 --> 35:07.310
She's not my girlfriend.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.563
So if you die down here,

35:10.818 --> 35:12.308
are you gonna regret
not kissing her?

35:15.739 --> 35:16.694
You should've kissed
your girlfriend.

36:34.568 --> 36:35.478
What?

36:41.617 --> 36:43.448
Just had a feeling like
something was behind us.

37:13.524 --> 37:14.434
You hear that?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.690
Is this why
you never get that far?

37:22.574 --> 37:23.484
Get ready!

37:34.378 --> 37:36.334
You... You please
don't do that ever again!

37:36.547 --> 37:37.627
Do what?

37:37.840 --> 37:40.297
I... I thought you just took off.
I thought you were running.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.502
I was running.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.716
No, I mean, like,
I thought you were leaving.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.723
I wouldn't leave without you.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.263
Really?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.137
I would never
leave without you.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.355
Them I would leave.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.354
Yeah.
Uh, it's progress.

38:04.742 --> 38:06.107
That doesn't look good.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.608
It's okay.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.534
Are you sure?
It looks deep.

38:09.747 --> 38:11.658
Yeah.
Icanfethheaﬁng.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.321
You didn't see anything?

38:14.752 --> 38:15.707
Barely.

38:16.378 --> 38:17.663
It had a strong scent, though.

38:18.422 --> 38:19.707
Like what?

38:20.883 --> 38:22.168
Like death.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.552
Where is it?
Do you see it?

38:31.769 --> 38:33.600
No, I don't know!
I can't see anything!

38:35.731 --> 38:37.642
Where is this thing?

38:39.735 --> 38:41.475
It's coming back!
It's coming back!

38:45.073 --> 38:46.279
Scott, get behind me.

38:47.201 --> 38:48.907
Scott, get behind me!

39:10.599 --> 39:11.714
I think I scared it.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.761
I think you scared everything.

39:18.065 --> 39:19.430
What is that?

39:34.748 --> 39:36.249
Tezcatlipoca.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.707
The nagual jaguar God.

39:43.841 --> 39:44.956
I think we found Derek.

40:03.735 --> 40:04.690
Stand back.

40:30.762 --> 40:31.968
Oh, my God.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.963
Is that him?
Is that Derek?

41:14.890 --> 41:16.846
Uh, sort of.
