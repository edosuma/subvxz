WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.105
THE ACCOUNTANT'S DROPPING OFF
THE PAPERS

00:04.105 --> 00:06.637
FOR MY CAYMAN ISLAND ACCOUNT.
 THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO ACCESS THE MONEY.

00:06.637 --> 00:09.210
EDIE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY...
 LET GO!

00:09.210 --> 00:11.212
BUT LOST IT.
 (both screaming)

00:11.212 --> 00:12.783
MIKE...

00:12.783 --> 00:15.686
YOU WILL GO TO REHAB,
OR SO HELP ME, I WILL LEAVE YOU.

00:15.686 --> 00:17.518
MADE A PROMISE.
 I'LL GO.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.591
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WE COVERED UP.

00:20.591 --> 00:24.355
KATHERINE'S AUNT WAS DETERMINED
TO REVEAL THE TRUTH...

00:26.797 --> 00:29.130
AND VICTOR...
 UHH!

00:29.130 --> 00:31.602
WAS A VICTIM OF THE TORNADO...
 UHH!

00:31.602 --> 00:33.564
THAT BROUGHT DEVASTATION...
 OH, MY GOD!

00:33.564 --> 00:35.536
(screaming)

00:35.536 --> 00:37.438
...TO WISTERIA LANE.

00:44.075 --> 00:46.547
(Mary Alice)
ONCE THE TORNADO HAD PASSED,

00:46.547 --> 00:49.120
IT BEGAN.

00:51.382 --> 00:56.387
A MAN GAVE HIS COAT
TO A STRANGER IN NEED...

00:56.387 --> 01:03.364
A WOMAN SHARED HER FOOD
WITH THOSE JUST PASSING BY....

01:05.135 --> 01:11.202
A TEENAGER REUNITED A DOG
WITH ITS WORRIED OWNER.

01:11.202 --> 01:13.244
THESE ARE
THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN

01:13.244 --> 01:16.607
IN THE WAKE
OF ANY GREAT DISASTER.

01:16.607 --> 01:21.812
PEOPLE START TO PERFORM
SMALL ACTS OF KINDNESS.

01:21.812 --> 01:23.514
(police radio chatter)

01:23.514 --> 01:27.258
THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP,

01:27.258 --> 01:29.660
ALL THE WHILE KNOWING...

01:29.660 --> 01:31.622
(siren wailing)

01:31.622 --> 01:36.197
IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.200
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

01:42.803 --> 01:46.137
WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG?
THEY SHOULD BE GOING FASTER.

01:46.137 --> 01:48.409
THE FIRE CAPTAIN SAID
THEY HAVE TO GO SLOWLY.

01:48.409 --> 01:52.213
THEY DON'T WANT DEBRIS SUDDENLY
COLLAPSING INTO THE BASEMENT.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.185
HAS ANYONE HEARD FROM GABY?

01:54.185 --> 01:56.517
UH, SHE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH CARLOS.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.520
HE WAS PRETTY BANGED UP,
BUT THEY SAY HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
 THANK GOD.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.153
WHY CAN'T WE HEAR THEM?

02:02.153 --> 02:05.526
IF MY KIDS ARE ALIVE,
THEY WOULD BE YELLING.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.528
(voice breaks)
TOM WOULD BE YELLING.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.530
OKAY, LYNETTE, LISTEN TO ME.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.233
THEY ARE ALL GOING TO BE FINE.
I KNOW IT.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.535
OKAY. YOU REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY THINK SO?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.707
YES, YES, I DO. I DO.

02:16.707 --> 02:19.710
SO I WANT YOU TO GO OVER
TO THOSE PARAMEDICS,

02:19.710 --> 02:22.243
AND I WANT YOU TO LET THEM
LOOK AT THESE CUTS.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.245
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE ALL BLOODY

02:24.245 --> 02:27.248
WHEN THEY PULL YOUR KIDS
OUT OF THERE, DO YOU?

02:27.248 --> 02:30.451
NO. NO, I GUESS NOT.
(sniffles) OKAY.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.224
(helicopter whirring,
siren wailing)

02:33.224 --> 02:35.326
(man shouting indistinctly)

02:35.326 --> 02:38.189
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:38.189 --> 02:39.730
WHAT?

02:39.730 --> 02:42.833
YOU DON'T KNOW IF HER KIDS
ARE GONNA BE OKAY.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.835
I'M JUST TRYING
TO COMFORT HER.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.837
BY GIVING HER FALSE HOPE?

02:46.837 --> 02:49.240
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO?

02:49.240 --> 02:52.243
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE SAYING,
"LYNETTE, THIS COULD END BADLY.

02:52.243 --> 02:56.247
SO YOU SHOULD START PREPARING
YOURSELF FOR THAT NOW."
 EDIE, IF YOU SAY THAT
TO LYNETTE,

02:56.247 --> 02:59.310
SO HELP ME GOD,
I WILL WRING YOUR NECK.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.312
AND I WILL HELP HER.

03:01.312 --> 03:04.315
TOM AND IDA AND THE KIDS
ARE BURIED UNDER THAT RUBBLE.

03:04.315 --> 03:06.317
I MEAN, WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

03:06.317 --> 03:08.519
WHY AREN'T YOU WILLING
TO FACE THE FACTS?

03:08.519 --> 03:10.591
BECAUSE WE'RE HOPING
FOR A MIRACLE.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.593
A MIRACLE?

03:12.593 --> 03:15.266
MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
IF WE STOP FLAPPING OUR GUMS,

03:15.266 --> 03:18.699
AND WE START ASKING GOD
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FOLKS,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.771
HE MIGHT JUST HELP US OUT.

03:20.771 --> 03:24.235
SO YOU THINK A PRAYER CIRCLE
IS GOING TO HELP LYNETTE?

03:24.235 --> 03:27.238
ONCE YOU GET TO MY AGE,
YOU'LL FIND IT A LOT EASIER

03:27.238 --> 03:29.710
TO BELIEVE THAT GOD
REALLY DOES ANSWER PRAYERS.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.244
SO IF YOU CAN JUST HANG ON
TWO MORE YEARS...
 DON'T.

03:33.244 --> 03:35.686
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE A MOMENT OF SILENCE

03:35.686 --> 03:38.289
WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BAD IDEA.

03:45.796 --> 03:49.460
HEY, GUYS! WE GOT SOMEONE!

03:49.460 --> 03:51.932
(crowd murmuring)
 (woman) OH!

03:54.605 --> 03:55.766
HI!

03:55.766 --> 03:58.809
(applause)

04:02.813 --> 04:04.445
COME ON. UHH!

04:05.816 --> 04:07.348
MOM!

04:07.348 --> 04:09.450
MOM!

04:09.450 --> 04:11.682
(sighs)

04:11.682 --> 04:13.524
MOM!
 MOM!

04:13.524 --> 04:16.457
(Lynette) OH, MY GOD! OH!
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

04:18.289 --> 04:20.291
(man) HOLD ON. HOLD OFF!

04:24.835 --> 04:26.967
COME ON, TOM.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.839
(man shouts indistinctly)

04:28.839 --> 04:30.501
(man) WAIT. WAIT.

04:30.501 --> 04:32.873
(groans)
 GRAB THE ARM.
GRAB THE ARM.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.475
(man) HERE HE COMES.
 (sighs)

04:34.475 --> 04:37.578
(sighs)

04:39.310 --> 04:42.313
STRAIGHT AHEAD, SIR.
GO AHEAD. RIGHT OVER THERE.

04:42.313 --> 04:44.585
(whispers) THANK YOU.
OH, MY GOD.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
(man)
GOT A LIGHT DOWN THERE?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.323
WHERE'S IDA?

04:53.524 --> 04:56.026
TOM! WHERE'S IDA?

05:06.637 --> 05:10.741
YES, IN THE WAKE
OF A GREAT TRAGEDY,

05:10.741 --> 05:14.345
PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY CAN
TO HELP...

05:17.548 --> 05:20.921
ALL THE WHILE KNOWING...

05:20.921 --> 05:32.332
IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.465
LYNETTE.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.838
THE MORNING AFTER THE TORNADO,

05:37.838 --> 05:39.840
THE RESIDENTS OF WISTERIA LANE

05:39.840 --> 05:43.374
BEGAN TO SORT
THROUGH THE DEVASTATION

05:43.374 --> 05:47.347
AND SLOWLY STARTED PICKING UP
THE PIECES OF THEIR LIVES.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.680
(man)
IT'S THERE BY THE NORTH SIDE!

05:49.680 --> 05:51.682
BOB HUNTER
FOUND PART OF HIS FOUNTAIN

05:51.682 --> 05:54.525
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

05:54.525 --> 05:59.490
BREE HODGE FOUND HER LAWN MOWER
NEXT TO HER COFFEE TABLE.

06:02.032 --> 06:08.098
AND KAYLA SCAVO DISCOVERED
HER MUSIC BOX IN A TREE...

06:08.098 --> 06:10.571
AMONG...

06:10.571 --> 06:12.403
OTHER THINGS.

06:12.403 --> 06:14.575
SHE HAD YOUR ADDRESS
IN HER POCKET,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.077
BUT THERE WAS NO OTHER I.D.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.879
DID YOU KNOW HER?

06:18.879 --> 06:22.483
SORT OF.
HER NAME IS SYLVIA GREENE.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.784
IS SHE LOCAL?

06:23.784 --> 06:25.786
I KNEW HER FROM CHICAGO.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.788
SHE WAS...

06:27.788 --> 06:29.420
VISITING.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.422
OKAY, I GUESS
THAT'S ALL WE NEED.

06:31.422 --> 06:34.094
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU

06:34.094 --> 06:36.727
AFTER WE CONTACT THE FAMILY?
 NO.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.801
(door opens)

06:42.903 --> 06:44.935
SO...
 (door shuts)

06:44.935 --> 06:48.038
I GUESS THIS MEANS
IT'S OVER.

06:48.038 --> 06:50.040
THE FACT THAT SHE IS DEAD

06:50.040 --> 06:53.484
DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT
THAT YOU SLEPT WITH HER.

06:53.484 --> 06:56.487
I KNOW IT DOESN'T.

06:56.487 --> 06:59.620
I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE,
AND I AM SO SORRY, KATHERINE.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.992
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

07:01.992 --> 07:04.825
I WANT YOU
OUT OF MY HOUSE TONIGHT.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.527
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.530
YES, I DO. IT'S OVER.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

07:09.530 --> 07:13.163
YOU COULD BE LYING ON THAT SLAB
RIGHT NEXT TO HER.

07:13.163 --> 07:15.606
(door opens)

07:17.167 --> 07:20.511
(whirring)

07:25.516 --> 07:27.047
(turns vacuum off)

07:27.047 --> 07:31.482
COME ON, IDA. YOU CAN
WATCH US PACK FROM UP HERE.

07:31.482 --> 07:34.955
WOW. THE THINGS YOU ACCUMULATE
IN A LIFETIME, HUH?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.728
YEAH, ESPECIALLY
IF YOU NEVER THROW ANYTHING OUT.

07:37.728 --> 07:40.460
(laughs)
SO HER NIECE AND NEPHEW

07:40.460 --> 07:42.963
ARE TAKING ALL THIS STUFF
BACK TO NEBRASKA?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.165
WELL, THE STUFF
THAT'LL SELL ON eBay.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.467
I'M GUESSING THE REST
WILL END UP IN A DUMPSTER.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.901
WHAT'S ALL THIS BASEBALL STUFF?
THERE'S A MITT AND A JERSEY.

07:50.901 --> 07:52.543
WAS THIS HER HUSBAND'S?

07:52.543 --> 07:55.045
NO, THAT WAS IDA'S
FROM HER PRO BASEBALL DAYS.

07:55.045 --> 07:56.577
YEAH, RIGHT.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.978
YEAH.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.681
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.683
IDA PLAYED
IN THE ALL-AMERICAN GIRLS LEAGUE

08:02.683 --> 08:05.656
DURING WORLD WAR II.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
 NO.

08:05.656 --> 08:08.158
OH, SHE WAS A SUPERSTAR.
ARM LIKE A CANNON.

08:08.158 --> 08:10.821
PEOPLE SAID SHE COULD THROW
A PORKCHOP PAST A HUNGRY WOLF.

08:10.821 --> 08:12.192
IDA?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.965
I HAVE TROUBLE SEEING HER
AS THE LEADOFF HITTER

08:14.965 --> 08:17.668
FOR ANYTHING
OTHER THAN OSTEOPOROSIS.

08:17.668 --> 08:20.901
SHE MADE THE ONLY UNASSISTED
TRIPLE PLAY IN LEAGUE HISTORY...

08:20.901 --> 08:23.534
RIGHT HERE
IN GRANVILLE FIELD, 1944.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.836
THAT'S WHY SHE WANTS HER ASHES
SCATTERED THERE.

08:25.836 --> 08:28.609
(front door opens)
 HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?

08:28.609 --> 08:29.810
(door shuts)

08:29.810 --> 08:32.813
DADDY SAID YOU WERE OVER HERE.
CAN I HELP?

08:32.813 --> 08:35.215
OH. (makes kissing sounds)

08:35.215 --> 08:37.847
YOU REALIZE WE'RE CLEANING,
RIGHT? WE'RE NOT EATING CANDY.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.650
THAT'S SWEET, PARKER,

08:39.650 --> 08:42.192
BUT WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL HERE

08:42.192 --> 08:44.193
IF YOU WANT TO GO PLAY.

08:44.193 --> 08:47.257
NO, I WANT TO DO SOMETHING NICE
FOR MRS. GREENBERG.

08:47.257 --> 08:49.259
SHE SORT OF SAVED MY LIFE.

08:49.259 --> 08:50.861
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:53.864 --> 08:56.236
WHEN THE HOUSE
STARTED SHAKING,

08:56.236 --> 08:59.009
AND DADDY WAS PASSED OUT
BY HIS ASTHMA...

09:00.741 --> 09:04.575
MRS. GREENBERG MADE US
ALL GO UNDER THE STAIRS.

09:06.617 --> 09:10.751
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHERE THEY FOUND HER.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.822
YEAH.

09:11.822 --> 09:14.254
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH ROOM
FOR HER.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.757
SHE SAID SHE'D BE OKAY
IN THE CORNER.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.092
UH, PARKER,
YOU WANT TO HELP?

09:22.092 --> 09:25.095
IDA HAS SOME ICE CREAM
IN THE FREEZER THAT NEEDS EATING

09:25.095 --> 09:28.268
BEFORE IT GOES BAD.
GO ON.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.610
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
BUT DON'T.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.613
IF YOU'D BEEN THERE, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE MADE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

09:57.067 --> 09:59.069
SUSAN,
WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

09:59.069 --> 10:03.173
OPENING YOUR HOME TO US--
IT'S SO GENEROUS.
 IT'S A HORRIBLE FEELING

10:03.173 --> 10:05.175
TO LITERALLY NOT HAVE A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD,

10:05.175 --> 10:08.979
AND THAT SMOKY FLEABAG HOTEL
JUST WASN'T SAFE FOR A NEWBORN.

10:08.979 --> 10:12.012
PLEASE, THIS IS
WHAT BEST FRIENDS DO...

10:12.012 --> 10:14.845
RIGHT BEFORE
THEIR FRIENDSHIP ENDS.

10:14.845 --> 10:19.189
WHY DID YOU AGREE
TO LET HER STAY?
 HOW DO YOU SAY NO
TO SOMEONE IN NEED?

10:19.189 --> 10:22.022
THAT WASN'T RHETORICAL.
SERIOUSLY, YOU GOT ANYTHING?

10:22.022 --> 10:25.025
I KNOW YOU FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE
SHE LET US STAY WITH HER ONCE,

10:25.025 --> 10:28.028
BUT DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HOW MISERABLE WE WERE?
 OH, YEAH.
EVERY CUP NEEDS A COASTER.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.030
EVERY COASTER NEEDS
A DOILY.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.062
EVERY DOILY
NEEDS DAILY LAUNDERING.

10:32.062 --> 10:35.235
THIS WOMAN IS GONNA DRIVE ME OUT
OF MY FRICKIN'--HEY, ROOMIES.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.408
YOU NEED HELP?
 (Orson) NO,
WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

10:38.408 --> 10:39.740
OH, AND, UH, LISTEN.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.072
BOB AND LEE INTRODUCED US
TO THIS WONDERFUL CONTRACTOR,

10:42.072 --> 10:45.075
SO WE WON'T BE IMPOSING
FOR LONG.
 IMPOSING. WHO'S IMPOSING?

10:45.075 --> 10:47.077
YOU CAN STAY AS LONG
AS YOU WANT.

10:47.077 --> 10:49.750
I'M SORRY.
THE WORDS CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH

10:49.750 --> 10:52.753
BEFORE I KNEW WHAT I WAS SAYING.
 THEN STOP TALKING,
AND DON'T BE SO NICE.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.755
OTHERWISE, SHE'LL JUST
TAKE THE PLACE OVER.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.758
(Bree) HEY, SUSAN, ORSON LIKES
TO SLEEP WITH THE WINDOW OPEN.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.190
DO YOU MIND
IF WE REARRANGE THE FURNITURE?

11:00.190 --> 11:01.661
(whispers) NO.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.196
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME!

11:10.300 --> 11:13.974
(organ playing hymn)

11:21.011 --> 11:22.682
HELLO, GABRIELLE.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.455
MILTON. HI.

11:29.219 --> 11:31.221
IT'S A NICE TURNOUT.
 (music stops)

11:31.221 --> 11:35.225
VICTOR WAS LOVED
BY A LOT OF PEOPLE.

11:35.225 --> 11:38.198
IT'S GONNA BE
A VERY EMOTIONAL DAY.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.833
YOU SEEM REMARKABLY COMPOSED.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.975
OH, NO, NO. I'M A MESS--

11:44.975 --> 11:48.078
YOU KNOW, ON THE INSIDE,
WHERE THE MASCARA CAN'T RUN.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.040
AH, I SEE.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.382
THE READING OF THE WILL
IS TODAY.

11:52.382 --> 11:55.145
IS IT? I'D FORGOTTEN.

11:55.145 --> 11:58.348
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE CURIOUS
AS TO HOW MUCH YOU'LL INHERIT.

11:58.348 --> 12:00.891
NO. I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT MONEY TODAY.

12:00.891 --> 12:02.452
I'M BURYING MY HUSBAND.

12:02.452 --> 12:03.924
OF COURSE.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.096
IT'S JUST, I, UH...

12:06.096 --> 12:08.098
SPOKE TO THE EXECUTOR
OF THE WILL,

12:08.098 --> 12:11.902
AND I HAVE A BALLPARK FIGURE
OF WHAT YOU'LL BE GETTING.

12:13.864 --> 12:15.465
(man coughs)

12:15.465 --> 12:18.839
OH?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.841
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S NOTHING DISRESPECTFUL

12:20.841 --> 12:22.442
ABOUT A BALLPARK FIGURE.

12:24.775 --> 12:26.817
YOU'RE NOT GETTING A DIME.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.482
VICTOR SHOWED ME THE PHOTOGRAPHS
OF YOU AND YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

12:32.482 --> 12:34.855
YOU BROKE HIS HEART.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.027
YOU HUMILIATED HIM.

12:37.027 --> 12:40.430
SO YOU'LL INHERIT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DESERVE--NOTHING.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.965
OKAY, I MADE A MISTAKE.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.368
I'M SORRY, BUT VICTOR
WASN'T ENTIRELY BLAMELESS.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.902
HE IGNORED ME.
HE USED ME POLITICALLY.

12:51.902 --> 12:54.274
OH, YEAH,
AND HE TRIED TO KILL CARLOS.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.047
SO I THINK I'M ENTITLED
TO WHATEVER HE HAD.

12:57.047 --> 12:58.809
AH, THERE'S THE THING.

12:58.809 --> 13:01.882
YOU MARRIED A MAN
FROM A VERY RICH FAMILY--

13:01.882 --> 13:05.085
THE OPERATIVE WORD
BEING "FAMILY."

13:05.085 --> 13:07.818
EVERYTHING'S IN MY NAME...
ALWAYS WAS.

13:07.818 --> 13:10.821
(organ resumes playing)

13:10.821 --> 13:13.193
THE SERVICE IS STARTING.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.296
I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

13:16.296 --> 13:21.071
GO? YOU CAN'T KICK ME
OUT OF MY HUSBAND'S FUNERAL.

13:21.071 --> 13:23.904
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE,
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.205
GO TO HELL.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.809
I'LL BE DELIVERING
THE EULOGY.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.942
IF YOU'RE STILL IN THIS PEW
WHEN I REACH THE PULPIT,

13:31.942 --> 13:34.244
I'M GOING TO BE TELLING
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

13:34.244 --> 13:37.888
THAT YOU ARE
A CHEATING, LYING WHORE.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.293
SEE?

13:43.293 --> 13:46.897
I TOLD YOU IT WAS
GONNA BE AN EMOTIONAL DAY.

14:02.212 --> 14:05.315
(guests murmuring)

14:17.888 --> 14:20.560
(hammering in distance)

14:20.560 --> 14:22.032
HELLO, BOYS.

14:22.032 --> 14:26.466
BOB, LEE, I BAKED YOU
SOME MUFFINS TO THANK YOU

14:26.466 --> 14:28.498
FOR INTRODUCING ME
TO WALTER HERE.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.540
AND, WALTER, I DECIDED
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

14:30.540 --> 14:34.044
DARK SHINGLES
ARE THE WAY TO GO.

14:34.044 --> 14:37.207
WHY ARE YOU ALL STARING AT ME?

14:37.207 --> 14:41.181
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO FIX YOUR HOUSE.
 WHAT?

14:41.181 --> 14:44.184
I'VE JUST HAD SOME BAD NEWS
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.356
OH, GOOD HEAVENS.
I HOPE NO ONE'S DIED,

14:46.356 --> 14:48.919
WHICH IS THE ONLY
POSSIBLE EXCUSE I'D ACCEPT.

14:48.919 --> 14:52.892
NO, IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST...

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO IT.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
WALTER, I CAN'T FIND
A CONTRACTOR NOW.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.129
EVERYBODY IS BOOKED
FOR THE NEXT YEAR.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.500
I'M SORRY.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.204
WALTER. WALTER. WALTER,
I'M BEGGING YOU. PLEASE.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.207
I'M LIVING LIKE A VAGABOND
IN A TEENAGE GIRL'S BEDROOM.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.909
I'M SLEEPING UNDER A POSTER
OF ORLANDO BLOOM.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.082
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.214
YEAH, WELL,
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO THAT.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.586
THEY JUST LEAVE.

15:20.090 --> 15:23.123
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.095
WHAT IS GOING ON?

15:25.095 --> 15:27.097
WALTER WENT THROUGH
A BAD BREAKUP,

15:27.097 --> 15:30.700
AND TODAY HE FOUND OUT THAT HIS
EX MOVED IN WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.664
OH, FOR GOD SAKES. TELL HIM
TO PUT ON HIS BIG BOY PANTS

15:34.664 --> 15:36.967
AND FIND ANOTHER GIRL.
 WHO SAYS IT'S A GIRL?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.010
WALTER'S GAY?

15:40.010 --> 15:42.512
YES. HE CAN BUILD HOMES
 ANDDECORATE THEM.

15:42.512 --> 15:45.015
SOMETIMES GOD GIVES
WITH BOTH HANDS.

15:45.015 --> 15:48.018
WELL, THEN YOU JUST HAVE
TO FIX HIM UP WITH SOMEONE,

15:48.018 --> 15:50.320
GIVE HIM BACK
HIS WILL TO WORK.
 (groans)

15:50.320 --> 15:54.024
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--
UH, MOST OF OUR FRIENDS ARE 9s,

15:54.024 --> 15:57.087
AND WALTER--WE LOVE HIM--
BUT KIND OF A 3.

15:57.087 --> 16:00.090
AND IN THE GAY WORLD,
3 DOES NOT GO INTO 9.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
WELL,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND HIM

16:08.968 --> 16:11.741
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT GOOD
AT GAY MATH.

16:11.741 --> 16:13.743
WELL, I DROVE
ALL THE WAY OUT THERE,

16:13.743 --> 16:15.745
AND I WAITED FOR HOURS

16:15.745 --> 16:18.248
AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T
LET ME SEE HIM.

16:18.248 --> 16:22.112
UH, NO. THEY JUST SAID THAT
I SHOULD--I SHOULD CALL YOU.

16:22.112 --> 16:23.453
(keys hit ground)

16:25.055 --> 16:27.687
LISTEN,
I KNOW IT'S A 30-DAY REHAB.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.689
I'M NOT TRYING TO BREAK HIM OUT.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.022
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE HIM.

16:34.564 --> 16:38.128
YOU KNOW WHAT? COULD YOU
JUST CALL ME WHEN YOU KNOW?

16:38.128 --> 16:39.599
THANK YOU.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.576
(sniffles)

16:49.039 --> 16:52.042
(classical music playing)

17:06.126 --> 17:08.698
(sighs) WELCOME TO HEAVEN.

17:08.698 --> 17:11.800
DON'T TALK. I'M SMELLING.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.603
WHAT IS THAT?

17:13.603 --> 17:17.067
DUCK A L'ORANGE. BREE SAYS
IT'S MAKING A COMEBACK.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.439
AND OUR OVEN
IS MAKING ITS DEBUT.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.071
OH, IT GETS BETTER.

17:22.071 --> 17:23.742
SHE DID OUR LAUNDRY, TOO.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.576
SMELL MY SOCK.
 OH.

17:26.576 --> 17:28.078
OH, MY GOD!

17:28.078 --> 17:30.120
(sniffs)
I WANT TO EAT THAT.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.122
(laughs)
SHE DUSTS. SHE IRONS.

17:32.122 --> 17:34.124
OH, AND SHE DOES
THIS MAGIC TRICK.

17:34.124 --> 17:36.126
NO MATTER WHERE
YOU THROW YOUR SWEATER,

17:36.126 --> 17:39.129
WITHIN SECONDS,
IT'S ON A HANGER.
 THIS HAS JUST REPLACED
YOUR BIRTH

17:39.129 --> 17:42.132
AS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

17:42.132 --> 17:45.165
OH, HI, SUSAN. I HOPE YOU
DON'T MIND THAT I MADE DINNER.

17:45.165 --> 17:48.168
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
THAT I'M GOING TO KISS YOU.
 OOH. YOU'RE FUNNY.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.170
NOW I NEED YOU TO BE HONEST
ABOUT THIS RECIPE.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.471
IT'S A DRY RUN

17:51.471 --> 17:54.174
FOR A SMALL DINNER PARTY
I'M HAVING TOMORROW NIGHT.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.446
AGAIN, IF YOU DON'T MIND.
 NOT AT ALL.

17:56.446 --> 17:59.679
IN--IN FACT, IF YOU WANNA
DO A DRY RUN FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.551
I'M THERE FOR YOU.
 DINNER WILL BE READY SHORTLY.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.414
OH, AND, JULIE, I FIXED THE HEM
ON THAT BLUE SKIRT OF YOURS.

18:04.414 --> 18:06.716
IT'S ON YOUR BED.

18:06.716 --> 18:10.260
MY HEM IS FIXED? SHE'S LIKE
THE MOTHER I NEVER HAD.

18:10.260 --> 18:11.561
OH, OH, NO OFFENSE.

18:11.561 --> 18:14.294
OH, NONE TAKEN.
 (laughs)

18:17.197 --> 18:20.200
(woman speaking indistinctly
over PA)

18:20.200 --> 18:23.203
(monitor beeping steadily)

18:27.507 --> 18:29.279
HEY.

18:29.279 --> 18:30.740
HOW YOU FEELING?

18:30.740 --> 18:32.412
UH, NOT SO GREAT.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.784
WELL, THEY SHOULD GIVE YOU
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN.

18:34.784 --> 18:37.247
THEY GAVE ME THIS BUTTON
THAT I CAN PRESS,

18:37.247 --> 18:39.149
BUT I'M TRYING
NOT TO USE IT,

18:39.149 --> 18:43.493
'CAUSE THE DRUGS MAKE ME FEEL
A LITTLE TO MELLOW. (groans)

18:43.493 --> 18:46.125
WAS THE FUNERAL SAD?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.357
TRAGIC.

18:47.357 --> 18:50.430
I FOUND OUT EVERYTHING
VICTOR HAD IS IN MILTON'S NAME,

18:50.430 --> 18:54.304
AND HE TOLD HIS FATHER ABOUT US,
SO I'M NOT GETTING A PENNY.

18:54.304 --> 18:57.467
WOW.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.369
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING

18:59.369 --> 19:01.471
YOU HOOKED UP
WITH ANOTHER RICH GUY.

19:01.471 --> 19:02.772
(groans)

19:02.772 --> 19:04.244
(chuckles nervously)

19:04.244 --> 19:06.216
YEAH...

19:06.216 --> 19:07.447
UH...

19:07.447 --> 19:10.250
GABY, YOU SOUND WEIRD.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.322
WHY DO YOU SOUND
SO WEIRD?

19:14.354 --> 19:16.226
GABY.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.528
UM, REMEMBER THAT DAY,

19:18.528 --> 19:19.889
UH...

19:19.889 --> 19:24.364
WHEN AL WAS GOING TO DROP OFF
THE ACCOUNT INFORMATION?

19:24.364 --> 19:27.197
OH, MY GOD. HE DIDN'T?

19:27.197 --> 19:29.199
NO, NO, NO. HE DID.

19:29.199 --> 19:32.372
IT'S JUST... REMEMBER
HOW WINDY IT WAS THAT DAY?

19:32.372 --> 19:35.174
NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS THE ONLY COPY.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.806
I KNOW,

19:36.806 --> 19:39.749
BUT EDIE WAS TRYING TO STEAL
THE PAPERS FROM ME,

19:39.749 --> 19:41.751
AND WE GOT INTO THIS FIGHT,

19:41.751 --> 19:44.584
AND THEN THE TORNADO
JUST TOOK THEM AWAY.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.185
THEY'RE GONE?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.258
KINDA.
 (clicking)

19:48.258 --> 19:49.359
OH.

19:49.359 --> 19:51.221
WHAT IS THAT SOUND?

19:51.221 --> 19:53.363
I'M TEXTING SOMEONE.

19:53.363 --> 19:55.365
GABY, THAT ACCOUNT WAS
OUR FUTURE.

19:55.365 --> 19:59.329
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?
 SHH. CARLOS,
JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

19:59.329 --> 20:02.502
I'M SURE AL HAS
AN ACCESS CODE OR A COPY

20:02.502 --> 20:05.575
OR SOME SUPER NERD WAY TO GET
BACK INTO THE ACCOUNT, OKAY?

20:05.575 --> 20:08.838
I KNOW WE CAN FIX THIS.

20:08.838 --> 20:12.211
YEAH.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.514
(breathy voice)
YEAH, HE COULD FIX IT.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.516
OKAY.

20:16.516 --> 20:20.350
ALL RIGHT,
YOU LOOK VERY TIRED,

20:20.350 --> 20:22.422
SO I'M JUST GONNA GO.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.625
BUT I'M WARNING YOU, GABY,
IF WE DON'T FIND THOSE PAPERS,

20:25.625 --> 20:30.260
SO HELP ME, I'M...
AHH.

20:30.260 --> 20:34.404
(woman speaking indistinctly
over PA)

20:44.314 --> 20:46.316
HI. UM,
I'M A FRIEND OF AL'S,

20:46.316 --> 20:49.018
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD SEE HIM.

20:49.018 --> 20:50.850
OF COURSE. PLEASE COME IN.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.252
THANKS.

20:55.525 --> 21:00.259
RIGHT THIS WAY.
 OKAY.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.593
(indistinct conversations)

21:08.037 --> 21:09.869
(sighs)

21:12.702 --> 21:14.744
OH, AL.

21:14.744 --> 21:16.706
(man)
THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR HELP.

21:16.706 --> 21:19.379
WELL, WE'D DO ANYTHING
FOR YOUR AUNT.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.651
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT AN AMAZING WOMAN SHE WAS.

21:21.651 --> 21:24.654
UH-HUH. HEY, DID YOU GUYS
HAPPEN TO FIND A PEARL NECKLACE?

21:24.654 --> 21:27.317
IT'S THE ONLY VALUABLE THING
AUNT IDA OWNED.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.319
WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE IT.

21:29.319 --> 21:32.692
YEAH, SHE PROMISED IT TO ME
IF SHE KICKED THE BUCKET FIRST.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.325
OH, REALLY? IN--IN WRITING?

21:36.766 --> 21:38.067
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

21:39.629 --> 21:43.032
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HIT THE ROAD.

21:43.032 --> 21:46.376
WHAT ABOUT
THE REST OF THESE BOXES?

21:46.376 --> 21:49.379
OH, THAT'S JUNK. YOU CAN
JUST GIVE 'EM AWAY. HEY, LISTEN.

21:49.379 --> 21:52.382
IS THERE A GOOD PLACE WE CAN
GRAB A BITE ON THE WAY OUT?

21:52.382 --> 21:54.984
UM, WELL, THERE'S A GREAT DINER
RIGHT NEAR GRANVILLE FIELD.

21:54.984 --> 21:57.987
OH. ISN'T THAT--
ISN'T THAT OUT OF THE WAY?
 YEAH, BUT AREN'T YOU

21:57.987 --> 22:00.450
STOPPING THERE ANYWAY
TO SPREAD YOUR AUNT'S ASHES?

22:00.450 --> 22:03.453
WE'RE KINDA PRESSED
FOR TIME.
 YEAH, WE THOUGHT
WE'D JUST PUT HER

22:03.453 --> 22:05.925
IN THE FAMILY PLOT
BACK IN OMAHA.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.627
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.699
IDA WANTED HER ASHES
SCATTERED AT THE FIELD.

22:09.699 --> 22:13.633
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THAT'S
KINDA CRAZY, DON'T YOU THINK?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.436
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
SHE WAS AN AMAZING WOMAN.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.639
YOU SHOULD RESPECT
HER WISHES.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.811
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

22:21.811 --> 22:24.714
YEAH.
 HEY, I-IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DO IT, I WILL.

22:24.714 --> 22:26.716
UH, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT FAMILY,

22:26.716 --> 22:28.918
SO I THINK
THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE.

22:28.918 --> 22:30.920
LOOK,
YOU'RE TAKING HER PEARLS.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.483
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS HONOR HER WISHES.

22:33.483 --> 22:35.485
OKAY, AT THE RISK
OF BEING BITCHY,

22:35.485 --> 22:37.487
THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

22:37.487 --> 22:41.090
SO COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST DROP IT?
 FINE.
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

22:41.090 --> 22:43.092
YOU PASSED BITCHY
TEN MINUTES AGO.

22:43.092 --> 22:46.436
CARTER, GET THE URN.
I WANT TO GET OUTTA HERE.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.671
WAIT!

22:51.671 --> 22:55.004
YOU'LL NEVER FIND IT.
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

23:22.071 --> 23:23.833
(blows)

23:27.106 --> 23:31.641
OH.
 BY THE WAY, I'M STAYING
AT IDA'S HOUSE FOR A WHILE

23:31.641 --> 23:34.644
SINCE, YOU KNOW, MY HOUSE
IS A PILE OF RUBBLE.

23:34.644 --> 23:37.146
OH, THAT'S SO SAD.
YOU'VE GOT A WEEK.

23:40.049 --> 23:41.751
HERE YOU GO.

23:41.751 --> 23:43.122
THANKS.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.755
(starts engine)

23:45.755 --> 23:48.628
JUST PUT IT IN THE CUP HOLDER.

23:55.465 --> 23:58.207
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU AL'S WIFE?

23:58.207 --> 23:59.809
I'M GABRIELLE LANG.

23:59.809 --> 24:02.772
YOU'RE THE MAYOR'S WIFE.
OF COURSE I RECOGNIZE YOU.

24:02.772 --> 24:07.046
SO I WAS SHOCKED
TO HEAR ABOUT AL.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.879
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I WAS SO DEVASTATED.

24:09.879 --> 24:13.152
DIDN'T YOU JUST BURY
YOUR HUSBAND YESTERDAY?

24:13.152 --> 24:17.527
THAT SUCKED, TOO.

24:17.527 --> 24:19.589
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO AL?

24:21.190 --> 24:23.192
(voice breaks)
HE WAS DRIVING HOME,

24:23.192 --> 24:26.736
TRYING TO BEAT THE STORM, AND HE
RAN INTO A DOWNED POWER LINE...

24:26.736 --> 24:29.038
(crying) AND HIS CAR
BURST INTO FLAMES.

24:29.038 --> 24:31.871
OH, SWEETIE, DON'T.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.874
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER AL
LIKE I DO--

24:34.874 --> 24:38.878
AT HIS DESK,
WITH A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE,

24:38.878 --> 24:42.782
SURROUNDED
BY ALL HIS FILES.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.885
(clears throat) BY THE WAY,
WHEREARETHOSE FILES?

24:45.885 --> 24:47.887
I CLEARED OUT HIS OFFICE.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.660
OH, I BET THAT WAS HARD.

24:50.660 --> 24:51.661
(sniffles)

24:51.661 --> 24:53.663
SO WHERE'D YOU PUT 'EM?

24:53.663 --> 24:55.224
IN THE GARAGE.

24:55.224 --> 24:56.866
WHICH IS...

24:56.866 --> 24:59.869
IN THE BACK.

24:59.869 --> 25:01.100
(sniffles)

25:01.100 --> 25:03.933
WELL, LOOK AT ME,
MONOPOLIZING THE WIDOW.

25:03.933 --> 25:06.806
YOU GO MINGLE.
I'M GONNA GET YOU A CRACKER.

25:17.947 --> 25:20.149
OHH.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.868
(groans)

25:51.721 --> 25:53.953
OH, CRAP.

26:05.194 --> 26:06.966
WHY, GOD?!

26:06.966 --> 26:10.770
WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE?!

26:10.770 --> 26:12.972
WHY, GOD?! WHY? WHY?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.174
WHY? WHY? WHY?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR LETTING US

26:24.583 --> 26:27.586
TAKE OVER YOUR DINING ROOM.
 PLEASE. THANK YOU
FOR MAKING US DINNER.

26:27.586 --> 26:31.090
OH, YOU WILL BE SENDING UP
DESSERT LATER?
 OH, SURE.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.023
JUST, UH, LEAVE YOUR TRAYS
IN THE HALL WHEN YOU'RE READY.

26:34.023 --> 26:36.796
(both giggle)

26:37.997 --> 26:39.869
OH.

26:39.869 --> 26:42.131
PUFF PASTRY?

26:42.131 --> 26:45.134
THANK YOU.
 OH, HERE IS
A NICE 12-YEAR-OLD SCOTCH

26:45.134 --> 26:48.978
TO WASH THAT DOWN WITH.
 UH, LOOK, IT'S NICE OF YOU
TO INVITE ME FOR DINNER,

26:48.978 --> 26:51.981
BUT IF YOU'RE HOPING TO CHANGE
MY MIND ABOUT DOING YOUR ROOF,

26:51.981 --> 26:53.983
I'M JUST--
I'M REALLY NOT UP TO IT.

26:53.983 --> 26:55.985
NO. NO, NO, WALTER,

26:55.985 --> 26:57.987
WE--WE JUST HEARD
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION

26:57.987 --> 27:01.821
AND THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE COMPANY. THAT'S ALL.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.823
YES, AND A NICE
HOME-COOKED MEAL.

27:03.823 --> 27:07.056
TRUST ME, THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY
NO TRICKS UP OUR SLEEVE.

27:07.056 --> 27:09.028
UH, I NOTICED THERE ARE
FOUR PLACE SETTINGS.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.730
IS SOMEBODY JOINING US?

27:10.730 --> 27:14.133
ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT?

27:19.108 --> 27:20.740
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:20.740 --> 27:23.312
I'M MOVING OUT.
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WEIRD

27:23.312 --> 27:26.015
STAYING IN THE GUEST ROOM
OF MY OWN HOUSE.

27:26.015 --> 27:29.749
BUT I THOUGHT YOU AND MOM
WERE TRYING TO WORK STUFF OUT.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.080
WE ARE.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.222
IT'S JUST... YOUR MOM
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE EASIER

27:33.222 --> 27:35.224
IF WE GAVE OURSELVES
A LITTLE DISTANCE.

27:35.224 --> 27:37.887
THEN WHY
DOESN'TSHEMOVE OUT?

27:37.887 --> 27:39.028
DYLAN.

27:39.028 --> 27:42.031
I'M SERIOUS. YOU CAN'T
LEAVE ME HERE ALONE WITH HER.

27:42.031 --> 27:44.133
I'LL GO CRAZY.

27:44.133 --> 27:47.336
HEY, COME ON. WE'RE GONNA SEE
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

27:47.336 --> 27:50.039
WHY DOES SHE ALWAYS
HAVE TO WIN?

28:14.263 --> 28:16.996
YEAH, I'M THINKING
OF STARTING MY TRIP IN PARIS.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.969
TODD AND I TALKED ABOUT GOING
THERE, BUT NOW I'M THINKING

28:19.969 --> 28:22.271
OF DOING IT MYSELF.

28:22.271 --> 28:25.004
WALTER RECENTLY SPLIT UP
WITH HIS LIFE PARTNER TODD.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.336
THEY WERE GAY.
 SMALL WORLD, HUH?

28:27.336 --> 28:29.478
HOW IS IT SMALL, EXACTLY?

28:29.478 --> 28:33.212
ANDREW IS ALSO
AN OUT-AND-PROUD HOMOSEXUAL.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.185
HE'S HERE, HE'S QUEER,
AND WE'RE USED TO IT.

28:36.185 --> 28:38.447
SINCE WHEN?

28:38.447 --> 28:41.090
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU TWO
HAVE IN COMMON? A LOVE OF BOOTS.

28:41.090 --> 28:43.793
ANDREW HAS
SOME BEAUTIFUL BOOTS.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.795
OH, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE

28:45.795 --> 28:48.758
THE FUN YOU TWO WOULD HAVE
IN THE BOOT SHOP.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.163
UM, MOM, I'M GONNA TAKE
THESE BOWLS TO THE KITCHEN.

28:54.163 --> 28:56.205
OH, THANKS, DEAR.

28:56.205 --> 28:57.967
WITH YOU.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.210
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:01.210 --> 29:03.342
I'M JUST TRYING
TO STAY OUT OF THE WAY

29:03.342 --> 29:05.875
OF ALL THOSE SPARKS
THAT ARE FLYING.

29:05.875 --> 29:08.047
SPARKS?
THE MAN'S TWICE MY AGE.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.348
YES, BUT HE'S ALSO--

29:09.348 --> 29:11.350
HE'S GOT A GREAT SENSE OF...

29:13.953 --> 29:18.057
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO GET A GOOD CONTRACTOR?

29:18.057 --> 29:20.189
OH, MY GOD!

29:20.189 --> 29:22.191
AND POOR WALTER
JUST HAD HIS HEART BROKEN,

29:22.191 --> 29:25.134
SO IF IT TAKES YOU BEING NICE
TO HIM TO GET OUR HOUSE FIXED,

29:25.134 --> 29:28.137
THEN...
 YOU'RE--YOU'RE PIMPING ME OUT
FOR A NEW ROOF?

29:28.137 --> 29:29.538
AND WINDOWS.

29:29.538 --> 29:33.202
BUT I AM NOT PIMPING YOU OUT.
I'M SIMPLY ASKING YOU

29:33.202 --> 29:35.204
TO SHOW SOME KINDNESS
TO A LONELY MAN

29:35.204 --> 29:38.247
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
AN EXCELLENT ROOFER.

29:38.247 --> 29:41.380
LOOK, IF BY KINDNESS
YOU MEAN SEX--
 WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THAT.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.984
YOU CAN RAISE A MAN'S HOPES
WITHOUT SATISFYING THEM.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.987
I'VE DONE IT ALL MY LIFE.
 (utensil clatters)

29:47.987 --> 29:51.320
ANDREW, I HAVE GOT
TO GET BACK INTO MY HOUSE,

29:51.320 --> 29:53.322
AND YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

29:55.024 --> 29:57.166
(sighs) FINE.

29:57.166 --> 29:59.168
FOR YOU, I WILL FLIRT,

29:59.168 --> 30:01.170
I WILL FLATTER,
AND I WILL CHARM.

30:01.170 --> 30:02.501
(sighs) BLESS YOU.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.173
AND IN EXCHANGE,

30:04.173 --> 30:07.436
I EXPECT
A 60-INCH FLAT SCREEN TV.

30:07.436 --> 30:10.179
FINE, AND IF YOU CAN
GET HIM TO COME IN

30:10.179 --> 30:13.182
ON TIME AND UNDER BUDGET,
I'LL THROW IN SURROUND SOUND.

30:21.290 --> 30:24.553
NO. THAT WALTER GUY
NEEDS TO STAY MISERABLE,

30:24.553 --> 30:27.256
BECAUSE IF HE'S NOT,
HE'LL FIX HER ROOF,

30:27.256 --> 30:30.259
AND THEN SHE'LL LEAVE US.
 MOM, WE ALWAYS KNEW
THIS COULDN'T LAST FOREVER,

30:30.259 --> 30:32.902
AND SHE'LL STILL BE HERE
ANOTHER WEEK OR TWO.

30:32.902 --> 30:34.904
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TIME.
SHE JUST STARTED

30:34.904 --> 30:37.867
STENCILING THE KITCHEN, AND I
DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU THIS,

30:37.867 --> 30:41.340
BUT THERE IS TALK
OF AN HERB GARDEN.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.913
I'VE GOTTA STOP HER.
 HOW?

30:43.913 --> 30:46.916
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'VE HAD
A TASTE OF IRONED PILLOWCASES,

30:46.916 --> 30:49.348
AND I AM NOT GOING BACK.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.480
(chuckles)

30:51.480 --> 30:54.223
OH, WALTER, YOU GOT
A LITTLE RIGHT THERE.

30:54.223 --> 30:56.355
OOH. THANK YOU.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.457
(Andrew) YEAH.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.260
HEY, EVERYBODY.
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

31:01.260 --> 31:04.463
BUT THE SMELL OF THAT APPLE PIE
JUST MADE MY MOUTH WATER.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.166
WELL, SAY NO MORE.
ONE SLICE COMING RIGHT UP.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.268
OH, SUSAN DELFINO,
THIS IS WALTER BIERLICH.

31:09.268 --> 31:13.302
(Orson) THIS IS SUSAN'S HOUSE.
SHE'S KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE US IN.
 HI. HOW ARE YOU?

31:13.302 --> 31:15.905
ALL RIGHTY. HERE YOU GO.

31:15.905 --> 31:17.246
THANKS.

31:18.247 --> 31:20.249
(Orson clears throat)

31:20.249 --> 31:24.183
OH. YOU'RE GOING TO EAT THAT...
HERE?

31:24.183 --> 31:26.485
OH, I'M JUST GONNA VISIT
FOR A WHILE.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.288
SO, ANDREW,
WE MISS YOU AROUND HERE,

31:29.288 --> 31:31.921
BUT I BET YOU LOVE
HAVING YOUR OWN PLACE.

31:31.921 --> 31:34.924
UH, YEAH.
IT'S--IT'S COOL.

31:34.924 --> 31:37.666
OF--OF COURSE,
IT DOES GET LONELY.

31:37.666 --> 31:41.370
IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE
STOP BY ONCE IN A WHILE.

31:41.370 --> 31:44.173
OH, WELL, YOU'LL REEL
SOMEBODY IN. YOU ALWAYS DO.

31:44.173 --> 31:47.436
(scoffs) YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HIS LAST BOYFRIEND--JUSTIN.

31:47.436 --> 31:49.378
HA! HE WAS SO HOT.

31:49.378 --> 31:51.310
YOU REALLY HAD A THING

31:51.310 --> 31:53.482
FOR THE YOUNG,
RIPPED MUSCLE BOYS, HUH?

31:53.482 --> 31:55.114
UM...

31:55.114 --> 31:59.018
HE DID AT ONE TIME,
BUT ANDREW'S OUTGROWN THAT.

31:59.018 --> 32:02.421
HE REALIZED THE FOLLY
OF BEING SO SHALLOW.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.224
EXACTLY, AND NOW, UM,
HIS TASTES HAVE GONE

32:05.224 --> 32:08.127
TO THE MORE MATURE, CULTURED
TYPES, LIKE, UH, WALTER HERE.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.560
OH!

32:11.560 --> 32:13.562
THIS IS A FIX-UP?

32:13.562 --> 32:16.565
WELL, I JUST--IT NEVER WOULD
HAVE OCCURRED TO ME, YOU KNOW,

32:16.565 --> 32:19.668
BECAUSE OF
THE VAST AGE DIFFERENCE.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.313
BUT, HELL. WHY NOT?
LIFE IS SHORT.

32:24.313 --> 32:27.146
CERTAINLY SHORTER
FOR WALTER.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.449
SUSAN.
 OH, NO, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S GREAT.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.622
YOU SHOULD GRAB LOVE
WHEREVER YOU CAN FIND IT.

32:33.622 --> 32:36.425
WHO CARES IF YOUR FRIENDS THINK
THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT?

32:36.425 --> 32:39.958
OH, SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS
PIECE OF PIE UPSTAIRS TO JULIE?

32:39.958 --> 32:43.292
NO, SHE'S RIGHT. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MY FRIENDS WOULD THINK.

32:43.292 --> 32:46.295
WELL,
THEN YOU NEED NEW FRIENDS.
 HEY, LISTEN. YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:46.295 --> 32:49.298
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY, AND IT
WOULD BE GREAT TO PARADE YOU

32:49.298 --> 32:52.641
IN FRONT OF MY EX, BUT, UH,
THEN I'D BE USING YOU.
 WELL, HE DOESN'T MIND.

32:52.641 --> 32:54.743
NO, PARADE ME.
(chuckles nervously)

32:54.743 --> 33:00.009
HE'S GOT A MESH TANK TOP THAT
WOULD BRING YOUR EX TO TEARS.

33:00.009 --> 33:02.681
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
AS TEMPTING AS THAT SOUNDS,

33:02.681 --> 33:07.316
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST NOT READY
TO DATE, SO...

33:07.316 --> 33:10.419
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE DINNER.

33:10.419 --> 33:12.191
(front door opens)

33:12.191 --> 33:14.363
(Bree) WALTER, WAIT!
 (door shuts)

33:14.363 --> 33:17.426
WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST BRING
THIS PIE UP TO JULIE.

33:17.426 --> 33:19.468
YOU.

33:19.468 --> 33:20.499
SIT.

33:33.082 --> 33:35.084
(car doors open)

33:35.084 --> 33:37.786
(doors shut)

33:37.786 --> 33:40.319
SO IS SOMEONE
MEETING US HERE OR WHAT?

33:40.319 --> 33:42.621
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.
I CALLED THE GENERAL MANAGER

33:42.621 --> 33:45.324
TO ASK IF WE COULD SCATTER
THE ASHES HERE,

33:45.324 --> 33:48.327
AND HE SAID
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.260
SO HOW ARE WE GETTING IN?

33:51.260 --> 33:52.401
OH, LYNETTE.

33:52.401 --> 33:55.364
HEY, YOU'VE ABETTED.
MIGHT AS WELL AID.

34:02.211 --> 34:04.243
LEAVE US.

34:14.523 --> 34:16.655
OKAY, I KNOW
THAT IT SOUNDS SELFISH,

34:16.655 --> 34:19.658
BUT I DID WHAT I DID
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO STAY.

34:19.658 --> 34:23.161
(scoffs) WHY? I-I THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT YOUR HOUSE BACK.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.494
WELL, YEAH, SURE, SOMEDAY,

34:25.494 --> 34:28.496
BUT RIGHT NOW I JUST LOVE
HAVING YOU TAKE CARE OF ME.

34:28.496 --> 34:32.400
ALL THE COOKING AND THE CLEANING
AND THE ALPHABETIZING...

34:34.473 --> 34:36.344
IT'S HELPING ME FEEL

34:36.344 --> 34:40.248
LIKE I'M NOT
JUST ABOUT TO FALL APART.

34:40.248 --> 34:42.551
OH, SWEETIE, YOU'RE OKAY.

34:42.551 --> 34:45.083
NO.

34:45.083 --> 34:49.257
I'M PREGNANT,
AND MY HUSBAND'S IN REHAB,

34:49.257 --> 34:52.221
AND THE ONLY REASON
I SEEM SANE

34:52.221 --> 34:56.625
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE, MAKING
MY HOUSE FEEL LIKE A HOME.

35:02.801 --> 35:06.375
THIS IS A CONVERSATION
THAT COULD BENEFIT

35:06.375 --> 35:09.278
FROM SOME HOMEMADE
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.642
CAN I HAVE MILK, TOO?

35:13.642 --> 35:16.215
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

35:21.450 --> 35:23.892
(crickets chirping)

35:23.892 --> 35:27.226
DO YOU MAYBE WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING FIRST?

35:27.226 --> 35:30.359
OH, UH, YEAH, I GUESS SO.

35:30.359 --> 35:32.661
OH. (mutters)

35:32.661 --> 35:34.603
UM...

35:34.603 --> 35:38.237
"DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE
AND WEEP.

35:38.237 --> 35:41.440
"UM, I'M--I'M NOT THERE.
I DO NOT SLEEP.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.612
"I AM A THOUSAND WINDS
THAT BLOW.

35:43.612 --> 35:47.316
I AM...
THE DIAMOND GLINTS OF SNOW."

35:48.677 --> 35:53.322
"I AM THE SUNLIGHT
ON RIPENED GRAIN.

35:53.322 --> 35:57.226
I AM
THE GENTLE AUTUMN'S RAIN."

35:59.588 --> 36:04.363
"DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE
AND CRY.

36:04.363 --> 36:07.736
I AM NOT THERE.
I DID NOT DIE."

36:09.268 --> 36:12.241
THAT WAS LOVELY.

36:14.443 --> 36:15.744
LET'S DUMP HER.

36:15.744 --> 36:17.746
AND TRY NOT
TO STAND DOWNWIND.

36:17.746 --> 36:20.849
SHE PLAYED THIRD BASE,
RIGHT?
 RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

36:20.849 --> 36:23.612
OH, MY GOODNESS.

36:25.314 --> 36:27.956
WAIT. UH, SORRY.
SHORTSTOP.

36:27.956 --> 36:29.718
OH, YEAH.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.522
OKAY.

36:34.563 --> 36:36.625
NO, ITWASTHIRD.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.668
DAMN IT, KAREN.
I'M RUNNING OUT OF IDA.

36:44.573 --> 36:46.935
(stadium lights clank loudly,
humming)

36:46.935 --> 36:48.677
(man) OKAY, DON'T MOVE!

36:48.677 --> 36:51.910
STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE
AND SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.512
(dog barks in distance)

36:53.512 --> 36:55.514
(lowered voice)
OKAY, SPLIT UP,

36:55.514 --> 36:57.886
AND I'LL MEET YOU
BACK AT THE CAR. GO!

36:57.886 --> 37:00.549
HEY, HEY! RIGHT THERE!

37:00.549 --> 37:02.491
OH!

37:02.491 --> 37:04.693
LADY, GET BACK HERE!

37:04.693 --> 37:05.824
OH. AAH!

37:05.824 --> 37:07.826
COME ON. COME ON. UHH!

37:07.826 --> 37:09.428
COME ON!

37:09.428 --> 37:11.300
RUN, JANE DOE, RUN!

37:11.300 --> 37:12.601
JUST GRAB HER!

37:12.601 --> 37:14.303
HEY, STOP, HEY!

37:14.303 --> 37:16.234
I GOT HER. COME ON.
 (laughs)

37:16.234 --> 37:18.667
(sighs) COME ON.

37:18.667 --> 37:22.641
(panting)

37:25.013 --> 37:28.016
SO WHEN I FINALLY CAME CLEAN,
HIS WIFE TOLD ME

37:28.016 --> 37:31.580
SHE SHREDDED ANYTHING THAT HAD
TO DO WITH OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.021
SHE WAS PROTECTING AL.

37:33.021 --> 37:35.624
(sighs)

37:35.624 --> 37:38.527
SO WE'RE BROKE.

37:38.527 --> 37:41.029
I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

37:41.029 --> 37:44.463
I-I KNOW THIS IS BAD,
BUT WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.735
WE'LL GET MARRIED AGAIN,

37:46.735 --> 37:48.837
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

37:48.837 --> 37:50.839
FOR RICHER, FOR POORER,
RIGHT?

37:55.744 --> 37:58.477
IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH.

37:58.477 --> 38:01.680
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.817
(kisses)

38:08.817 --> 38:10.819
I'M GONNA GO DOWN
TO THE CAFETERIA

38:10.819 --> 38:12.821
AND GET US
A COUPLE OF GINGER ALES

38:12.821 --> 38:15.764
TO TOAST OUR FUTURE.

38:15.764 --> 38:19.067
HEY, DOCTOR. HE'S LOOKING BETTER
AND BETTER EVERY DAY.

38:19.067 --> 38:21.069
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

38:24.873 --> 38:27.576
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET,
HAVE YOU?

38:27.576 --> 38:29.838
I'M WORKING ON IT.

38:29.838 --> 38:34.583
CARLOS, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT GIVE HER SOME CREDIT.

38:34.583 --> 38:37.586
SHE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU
BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR SIGHT.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.821
YOU DON'T KNOW GABY.

38:52.501 --> 38:53.862
(car door shuts)

38:56.405 --> 38:59.408
THANK GOD THOSE COPS
LET US OFF WITH A WARNING.

38:59.408 --> 39:02.040
I WAS THIS CLOSE
TO MY THIRD STRIKE.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.716
I'M JUST GLAD WE GAVE IDA
WHAT SHE WANTED.

39:07.716 --> 39:09.848
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING
YOU DID.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.851
(grunts) THEN WHY DON'T I
FEEL BETTER?

39:12.851 --> 39:15.353
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU?

39:15.353 --> 39:16.985
BECAUSE IT WASN'T ENOUGH,

39:16.985 --> 39:19.958
NOT COMPARED
TO WHAT SHE DID FOR ME.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.462
SHE SAVED MY KIDS.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.763
SHE'S THIS AMAZING WOMAN,

39:24.763 --> 39:27.466
AND I NEVER BOTHERED
TO GET TO KNOW HER,

39:27.466 --> 39:29.468
SO, YEAH,
I SPRINKLED HER ASHES,

39:29.468 --> 39:31.470
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

39:31.470 --> 39:33.802
TO DO SOMETHING
 BEFORESHE WAS ASHES.

39:33.802 --> 39:36.805
THAT'S A LESSON WE ALL
GOTTA LEARN OVER AND OVER--

39:36.805 --> 39:39.548
APPRECIATE PEOPLE
WHILE WE STILL GOT 'EM.

39:39.548 --> 39:40.879
YEP.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.617
THIRD STRIKE?

39:48.617 --> 39:50.759
WHAT WERE THE FIRST TWO?

39:50.759 --> 39:52.761
(chuckles)
IT'S A LONG STORY.

39:52.761 --> 39:56.024
THAT REQUIRES A PITCHER OF BEER
AND A DARK BAR.

39:56.024 --> 39:58.396
I GOT TIME FOR THAT.

40:11.139 --> 40:13.141
WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

40:13.141 --> 40:15.584
I THOUGHT YOU FOUND
A MOTEL ROOM.

40:15.584 --> 40:16.915
I DID,

40:16.915 --> 40:19.948
BUT I WANTED TO SET SOMETHING
STRAIGHT BEFORE I GO.

40:21.890 --> 40:25.023
I'M NOT LEAVING
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.796
I'M LEAVING
BECAUSE I'M WALKING OUT ON YOU.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.860
OH, IS THAT
HOW WE'RE GONNA PLAY THIS?

40:31.860 --> 40:34.503
FINE. WHATEVER.
YOU'RE LEAVING ME.

40:34.503 --> 40:36.835
OH, YEAH, AND HERE'S WHY.

40:38.907 --> 40:40.939
YOU BLAMED WHAT HAPPENED
ON YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

40:40.939 --> 40:42.911
AND I BELIEVED YOU.

40:42.911 --> 40:44.913
YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT,

40:44.913 --> 40:48.146
AND NOW I FIND OUT
IT WAS YOURS.

40:50.619 --> 40:55.724
WE'RE ABOUT EVEN
IN THE BETRAYAL DEPARTMENT NOW.

40:55.724 --> 40:57.926
IN FACT...

40:57.926 --> 40:59.728
I THINK YOU WIN.

41:06.094 --> 41:08.997
(door opens and shuts)

41:33.992 --> 41:36.825
IT HAD BEEN SEVEN DAYS

41:36.825 --> 41:41.930
SINCE A TORNADO
DEVASTATED WISTERIA LANE,

41:41.930 --> 41:43.902
AND THE RESIDENTS CONTINUED

41:43.902 --> 41:48.537
TO PICK UP THE PIECES
OF THEIR LIVES.

41:48.537 --> 41:52.040
SOME SALVAGED
PRECIOUS FRIENDSHIPS.

41:53.241 --> 41:57.215
SOME UNCOVERED
COLORFUL HISTORIES.

41:59.017 --> 42:03.521
OTHERS FOUND CHALLENGES
THEY HADN'T EXPECTED.

42:09.257 --> 42:11.029
AND THEN...

42:13.902 --> 42:16.935
THERE WAS ONE GIRL...

42:16.935 --> 42:18.937
WHO STUMBLED UPON THE TRUTH

42:18.937 --> 42:22.040
SHE'D LONG BEEN
SEARCHING FOR...

42:24.012 --> 42:27.215
ONLY... TO WISH SHE HADN'T.

42:27.215 --> 42:29.217
(gasping)
