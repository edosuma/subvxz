31:19.985 --> 31:21.319
[Knock at door]

31:23.622 --> 31:25.073
We have to talk.

31:25.107 --> 31:27.075
You cannot be here.
Go home.

31:27.109 --> 31:28.943
No, I-I will.
I promise. I will.

31:28.978 --> 31:31.246
- Just give me two minutes.
- Hey, is that Swifty?

31:31.280 --> 31:34.415
Leo! Hey.
[Laughs] My man!

31:34.449 --> 31:36.668
You have tripled in size!

31:36.719 --> 31:38.953
Oh, listen to me.
I've turned into that guy.

31:38.971 --> 31:40.505
What happened
to the goatee?

31:40.556 --> 31:42.957
Oh, it's gone.
But I did get this.

31:42.975 --> 31:45.293
- Am I still cool?
- For an old guy.

31:45.311 --> 31:47.178
Michael is just
dropping something off.

31:47.229 --> 31:48.646
You want to stay
for dinner?

31:48.681 --> 31:50.315
Oh, no, no, no.
There's not enough food.

31:50.349 --> 31:52.350
Well, actually, I'd love to.
I-I skipped lunch.

31:52.401 --> 31:53.685
Well, don't get
too excited.

31:53.719 --> 31:54.986
You know my mom's
idea of cooking

31:55.020 --> 31:56.854
is nuking stuff
from trader Joe's.

31:56.906 --> 31:58.356
That's not true!

31:58.407 --> 32:00.825
I made the salad.

32:08.984 --> 32:11.469
Hey!
[Pounding on door]

32:11.503 --> 32:14.322
I know you're in there.
The doorman told me you were.

32:14.340 --> 32:17.041
[Pounding continues]
He didn't even try to stop me.

32:17.092 --> 32:19.794
He was so nice,

32:19.828 --> 32:23.131
and he treated me
with respect.

32:23.165 --> 32:26.134
Do you even know
what that is...

32:26.168 --> 32:27.735
Respect?

32:27.770 --> 32:29.220
You're drunk, Ivy.

32:29.271 --> 32:31.889
What are you going on about?

32:31.941 --> 32:34.809
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm not the problem. You are.

32:34.843 --> 32:36.644
You blow so hot and cold,

32:36.678 --> 32:38.512
I don't even know what day
it is anymore.

32:38.530 --> 32:40.148
You are so hideous to me
in rehearsal...

32:40.182 --> 32:41.532
I'm hardly hideous.

32:41.567 --> 32:43.067
You humiliate me...

32:43.118 --> 32:45.320
When you're not
ignoring me!

32:45.354 --> 32:47.355
Half the time,
I feel like I don't even exist

32:47.373 --> 32:50.425
for you in there!

32:50.459 --> 32:52.460
No one does.

32:57.216 --> 33:00.718
I am not kidding.

33:00.753 --> 33:03.087
And this isn't some big,
romantic statement

33:03.138 --> 33:05.423
about who I am as an artist...
It is just a fact.

33:05.474 --> 33:07.358
Oh, don't give me...

33:07.393 --> 33:10.194
Don't give you what...
The truth?

33:10.229 --> 33:13.181
Isn't that
what you came here for?

33:13.215 --> 33:16.117
Look, I am building something
in that rehearsal room,

33:16.151 --> 33:19.370
and with all due respect,
it would be a lot easier

33:19.405 --> 33:22.040
if everyone pretended
just for five minutes

33:22.074 --> 33:23.775
not to have
all those annoying feelings,

33:23.826 --> 33:25.610
because frankly,
they get in my way.

33:25.661 --> 33:27.195
Theater
is about feelings!

33:27.229 --> 33:30.031
Oh, you can have feelings.

33:30.065 --> 33:33.785
They just need to be
about Marilyn.

33:33.836 --> 33:36.754
I'm not kidding.

33:36.789 --> 33:39.240
I know you're not.

33:47.950 --> 33:49.934
Are you staying?

33:52.638 --> 33:55.189
Are you asking me to stay?

33:57.259 --> 33:59.644
Come on...

34:04.766 --> 34:07.819
Don't be mad at me.

34:17.112 --> 34:18.496
Come on.

34:18.530 --> 34:19.797
Can I tell you again

34:19.831 --> 34:21.466
how incredible you look
in that dress?

34:21.500 --> 34:23.784
Thanks, babe.
This our table?

34:23.802 --> 34:25.453
Uh, sort of.

34:25.471 --> 34:27.588
R.J.'s assistant made sure
I sit by Jill Abramson.

34:27.621 --> 34:29.841
Which wasn't easy and could
seriously help this guy

34:29.891 --> 34:31.641
land the press secretary job.

34:31.677 --> 34:34.078
She's the executive editor
of the <i>New York Times.</i>

34:34.112 --> 34:35.596
And?

34:35.630 --> 34:36.981
Well, she's got
the mayor's ear.

34:37.014 --> 34:38.966
And?

34:38.984 --> 34:44.772
There are no extra seats
at this table. Sorry.

34:44.806 --> 34:47.975
Where do I go... the kitchen,
the West Side highway?

34:47.993 --> 34:49.494
No, it's...
It's just there.

34:49.527 --> 34:52.463
Table six, by the,
uh, helicopter.

34:52.498 --> 34:54.197
Perfect.

34:54.248 --> 34:57.335
Come on, there must be
some little <i>chiquita</i>

34:57.369 --> 34:58.652
who's after you.

34:58.670 --> 35:00.288
Girls in my school
are lame.

35:00.322 --> 35:02.206
Okay, show's over.
We're done.

35:02.257 --> 35:04.792
And what's this brush
with the law I heard about?

35:04.826 --> 35:05.993
You, uh...
You hitting the old...

35:06.011 --> 35:07.661
[Inhaling sharply]

35:07.679 --> 35:10.331
- You told him about that?
- I said, "we're done."

35:10.349 --> 35:13.634
You know, your mother and I
used to smoke a little doob

35:13.668 --> 35:14.902
after a tough rehearsal.

35:14.937 --> 35:16.554
- What?
- Michael!

35:16.605 --> 35:18.506
She said she tried it
once at camp.

35:18.524 --> 35:19.957
You are such a liar.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.226
Okay, Leo,
up to your room, now.

35:22.277 --> 35:24.312
Michael, I am calling you
a car again.

35:24.346 --> 35:26.197
I don't know what happened
to the last one.

35:26.231 --> 35:27.732
Stop laughing.
[Laughs]

35:27.783 --> 35:31.702
Yes, hi.
It's 428 Carroll, again.

35:31.737 --> 35:33.738
I'm sorry.
I just assumed he knew.

35:33.772 --> 35:37.074
What else does my mom do
after a tough rehearsal?

35:37.126 --> 35:39.076
In bed, now!

35:39.111 --> 35:41.078
[Leo laughs]

35:41.130 --> 35:42.797
[Door closes]

35:45.250 --> 35:47.535
Well, it's... it's not
on Broadway yet.

35:47.553 --> 35:50.204
It's a workshop based
on Marilyn Monroe's life.

35:50.222 --> 35:53.341
Are you Marilyn?

35:53.375 --> 35:56.060
Yes, yes.
Yeah, I am.

35:56.094 --> 35:57.562
That's wonderful.

35:57.596 --> 35:59.347
So do they have you
in a little blonde wig

35:59.381 --> 36:01.882
- and a skirt that blows up?
- Okay.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.902
Sorry, but, hey,
you wear a dress like that,

36:04.937 --> 36:07.388
you got to like it
that we look.

36:07.406 --> 36:10.525
Oh, that's right.
That's why I wore this...

36:10.559 --> 36:13.361
So that men everywhere
could enjoy looking at me

36:13.395 --> 36:15.279
and think
about having sex with me.

36:15.314 --> 36:16.731
- Oh!
- Was that too direct?

36:16.765 --> 36:19.233
- That's pretty direct.
- [Laughs]

36:19.251 --> 36:21.736
So is the dress, and we
already know you like that.

36:21.770 --> 36:25.206
- I'm seeing the Marilyn.
- You want to see some more?

36:25.240 --> 36:28.793
Maybe I should sing you
<i>Happy Birthday, Mr. President.</i>

36:28.844 --> 36:30.578
Would you like that?

36:30.612 --> 36:34.582
How about <i>Happy Birthday,</i>
<i>Mr. Press secretary?</i>

36:34.600 --> 36:38.135
- Press secretary?
- That's right.

36:38.187 --> 36:40.805
You're looking at
the next mayoral press secretary

36:40.856 --> 36:41.922
of New York City.

36:41.940 --> 36:44.458
Really?
Wow.

36:44.493 --> 36:47.445
So, uh, do you work
for the city?

36:47.479 --> 36:51.148
Well, not this one
right now... D. C.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.067
How did we get back
to politics?

36:53.101 --> 36:54.952
What do you say...

36:54.987 --> 36:58.239
You sing for me
back at my hotel,

36:58.273 --> 37:00.658
and I buy you room service?

37:00.709 --> 37:04.846
What a fantastic offer...

37:04.880 --> 37:07.114
Mr. Denby.

37:07.132 --> 37:09.617
I'll be in touch.

37:09.635 --> 37:12.303
Excuse me.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.436
Who are you?
Sherlock Holmes?

37:19.498 --> 37:20.848
How did you get
all that out of him?

37:20.883 --> 37:22.383
I didn't even have
to try.

37:22.434 --> 37:25.119
- This dress did all the work.
- Well, thank you.

37:25.154 --> 37:28.506
You know,
I'm sorry for everything.

37:29.942 --> 37:32.510
Well, this car
is helping me forgive you.

37:32.528 --> 37:33.844
It sure beats the "C" train.

37:33.862 --> 37:35.863
Oh, you can thank R.J.
for this.

37:35.898 --> 37:38.032
- Do we have to?
- Karen.

37:38.066 --> 37:40.868
I am kidding.
I know there's nothing going on.

37:40.903 --> 37:42.737
She just...
She bugs me.

37:42.788 --> 37:44.205
Oh, there's so nothing
going on.

37:44.239 --> 37:47.158
- I know.
- What are you doing?

37:47.192 --> 37:49.410
I'm proving that
there's nothing wrong with me

37:49.461 --> 37:50.661
below the neck.

37:50.695 --> 37:51.996
Well, I never
thought there was.

37:52.030 --> 37:54.198
Um, mmm. Mmm.

37:56.034 --> 37:57.835
Um, sorry.

37:57.869 --> 38:00.054
Is there a screen thingamajig
you could put up or something?

38:00.088 --> 38:01.639
- No, sir.
- Okay.

38:08.447 --> 38:12.517
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.953
Wait.
What is your "wow" about?

38:15.988 --> 38:17.922
Um...

38:17.956 --> 38:21.692
I guess just that we finally got
together and did it.

38:21.727 --> 38:25.112
Yeah.
That's true.

38:26.949 --> 38:31.752
Wait. Why?
What was your "wow" about?

38:31.787 --> 38:37.925
I mean, the sex was great too.
Don't get me wrong.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.628
Tom, I think
it's safe to say

38:40.679 --> 38:43.747
that what we just had was in
no way anywhere near "wow" sex.

38:43.765 --> 38:46.968
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I'm so relieved.

38:47.019 --> 38:49.387
Did you really think that
I thought it was great sex?

38:49.421 --> 38:51.138
It was terrible sex.

38:51.190 --> 38:54.775
It was maybe even
"wow, that was terrible" sex.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.445
Well, I mean,
it wasn't that bad.

38:57.479 --> 38:58.596
I've had worse.

38:58.614 --> 39:00.264
I'm not sure I have.

39:00.282 --> 39:03.367
[Both laughing]

39:27.459 --> 39:29.827
[Papers rustle]

39:43.292 --> 39:45.126
Okay,
this has got to be us.

39:45.160 --> 39:48.379
It's got to be us.
It's got to... it's got to be us.

39:48.413 --> 39:51.032
Why are you trying so hard
to get rid of me, Jules?

39:51.083 --> 39:53.651
You know
you can't get rid of me.

39:56.204 --> 39:59.123
Michael, look at me.

39:59.157 --> 40:01.876
Gladly.

40:01.910 --> 40:03.044
What?

40:03.095 --> 40:05.463
We both
have families now.

40:05.497 --> 40:07.448
I love mine
more than anything,

40:07.482 --> 40:10.334
and I know
you love yours.

40:10.352 --> 40:13.554
We're not gonna mess that up,
do you hear me?

40:13.605 --> 40:16.557
