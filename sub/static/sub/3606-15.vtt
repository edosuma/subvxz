00:00.634 --> 00:05.070
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:08.540
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:10.642
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.378
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:16.148
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.150 --> 00:18.017
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:22.421
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.423 --> 00:26.291
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.293 --> 00:29.895
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.897 --> 00:31.864
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:34.533
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:38.537
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.472
Cat:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.474 --> 00:43.575
Assistant number one,
meet assistant number two.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.844
-I'm two?
-Siobhan Smythe.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.613
(Chuckles) I'm not
here to make friends.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.915
<i> I'm here to be</i>
<i> the next cat Grant.</i>

00:49.917 --> 00:51.383
Lucy caught me lying.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.019
I need to be able
to tell her that
you are Supergirl.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.888
(Astra gasps)

00:57.725 --> 00:59.525
-What happened?
-I killed her.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.861
-Why did you lie to Kara?
-Because you're
Supergirl's hero.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.031
I don't know how to work
alongside you anymore.

01:06.033 --> 01:10.436
Humanity is a disease,
myriad is the cure.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.675
(Alarm buzzing)

01:55.449 --> 01:56.715
(Alarm stops)

01:57.418 --> 01:58.884
(Knocking on door)

01:58.886 --> 01:59.985
(Groans)

02:08.028 --> 02:10.129
If I X-ray vision that box,
will I see a cruller?

02:10.131 --> 02:11.663
You will not. They were out.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.165
-(Groans)
-But I got you
the powdered ones.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.401
And yet you know
I'm all about the cruller.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.840
An offering of donuts.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.775
Whatever could you
want from me?

02:23.777 --> 02:28.247
Ah! I just thought that
you might need the extra
sugar kick before...

02:28.249 --> 02:29.915
You know, coming back to work.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.487
I'm not going back
to the deo, Alex.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.156
I can't.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.694
Kara, Hank was
only doing his duty.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.531
Okay? Protecting the planet.
Just like you do, every day.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.866
I don't kill.

02:47.868 --> 02:51.036
But soldiers do,
when they have to.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.473
And Hank had to.

02:56.243 --> 03:00.045
I had the chance to bring
astra back into the light.

03:00.047 --> 03:03.115
And Hank cheated her
and me out of that chance.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.751
I know I should be
better than this,

03:05.753 --> 03:08.120
but I don't think
i can forgive him for that.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.961
I love working with you...

03:15.963 --> 03:19.731
But maybe it's time
for me to be my own Supergirl.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.002
Shoot, I gotta go to work.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.173
(Sighs)

03:32.713 --> 03:34.446
Good morning, Siobhan.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.348
Ker-rah.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.749
-It's Kara.
-(Chuckles)

03:37.751 --> 03:39.818
How's it going, Siobhan?

03:39.820 --> 03:43.322
I'm sorry. I have difficulty
making conversation with men
under six feet tall.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.623
Is that for Ms. Grant?

03:44.625 --> 03:46.658
"For her eyes only."

03:46.660 --> 03:50.195
Ms. Grant, uh, likes
for everything to be open
before it reaches her desk.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.197
I spent the last 90 minutes
in the mail room

03:52.199 --> 03:55.567
letting a glorified postal
worker stare at my chest,

03:55.569 --> 03:57.603
so I could be the one
to give this to cat.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.705
-And I'll take the credit.
-(Elevator bell dings)

03:59.707 --> 04:01.673
Tweedledee.
Staff meeting.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.843
Everyone in my office.
Stat with a side of asap!

04:04.845 --> 04:07.079
I guess that makes you
tweedledum.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.618
I could throw her into space.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.953
I dream about doing that.

04:14.955 --> 04:18.123
My massage therapist
spent the entire session

04:18.125 --> 04:21.193
talking about how her
surrogate has celiac disease

04:21.195 --> 04:23.729
and my pilates instructor
just informed me

04:23.731 --> 04:27.366
that he's quitting to open up
an artisanal yarn store
in Vermont.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.067
So, which one of you
hearty souls

04:29.069 --> 04:32.170
is going to give me
a reason to go on living? You?

04:32.172 --> 04:35.374
The national city men's chorus
is organizing a lego drive...

04:35.376 --> 04:36.942
And I'm comatose.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.543
Fashion. Speak.

04:38.545 --> 04:41.079
We're seeing crushed velvet
as an important look
this fall...

04:41.081 --> 04:43.448
Oh! Try crushed dreams.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.916
Anyone else?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.019
Ms. Grant, this came for you
via private courier.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.054
I've been keeping it safe
from prying eyes.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.857
Why didn't you open it?
It could be Anthrax.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.160
(Stammering)

04:58.365 --> 04:59.865
-It's not.
-Cat: Oh.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.000
-Thumb drive.
-Oh.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.971
And a letter.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.974
Cat: "Make the liars
pay for their lies.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.010
"Make the cheaters feel
the pain of their betrayal."

05:12.012 --> 05:15.280
That's the website
for adulterers,
diamonddiscretions.Com.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.149
It's like Ashley Madison,
except for...

05:17.151 --> 05:19.184
The difference is,
this is supposed
to be un-hackable.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.620
It was attacked by an
anonymous hacker last night.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.288
None of the data they took
has been released.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.525
Because the hacker
wanted it reported
by a major media outlet.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.193
So they sent it to me.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.629
You. Brown hair.
Put it in the microwave.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.197
Set it to "popcorn."

05:32.199 --> 05:34.766
Well, actually,
put it on "baked potato."

05:34.768 --> 05:37.803
Uh, whichever, just melt it.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.639
Cat, that website caters
to powerful people.

05:40.641 --> 05:44.376
Elected officials,
public figures
espousing a morality

05:44.378 --> 05:46.044
they themselves ignore.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.246
They're hypocrites.
Liars.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.449
The public has a right
to know the truth.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.484
Cat: Oh, Lucy.

05:52.486 --> 05:56.021
We live in a brave new world
of gay marriage and
transgendered Republicans.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.190
Nobody bats an eye
at that stuff anymore.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.525
Also, I've been
on the other side.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.995
And if we publish these names,
we give these disgusting
bottom-feeders legitimacy.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.032
And therefore, major Lane...

06:07.034 --> 06:09.634
The terrorists will have won.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.677
(Grunts)

06:25.419 --> 06:26.885
(Both grunting)

06:41.702 --> 06:43.068
(Choking) Okay!

06:43.070 --> 06:45.003
(Gasps)

06:45.005 --> 06:48.807
As effective as kicking
and punching is, next time
you're angry about something,

06:49.576 --> 06:51.376
let's have coffee.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.878
I'm not angry.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.780
I'm sad.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.449
(Breathing heavily)
I miss having Kara here.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.050
Her choice, Alex.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.319
But it's not. It was mine.

07:01.321 --> 07:06.792
When I decided to let her
believe that you killed astra
and not me.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.894
Telling Kara will only cause
you both more pain.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.897
And it won't stop
another alien attack.

07:11.899 --> 07:16.234
What if we fail because
Supergirl isn't at our side?

07:16.236 --> 07:18.970
This organization functioned
long before your sister.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.272
Long before you even.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.441
I'm not belittling
her importance,

07:22.443 --> 07:25.277
but the deo will go on.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.879
As will your relationship
with Kara.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.782
What about
your relationship with her?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.318
You've lost so many
in your life.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.954
How can you stand
to lose her too?

07:38.392 --> 07:39.724
Hard experience.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.992
(Beeps)

07:41.728 --> 07:43.161
(Sighs)

07:48.535 --> 07:51.002
James: Potstickers.
Kara: Is that from
chow Hong's?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.071
-Mmm-hmm.
-Ooh, that's my favorite.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.573
I know.

07:54.575 --> 07:58.109
Um... hey, did you think that
cat did the right thing

07:58.111 --> 08:00.412
by not releasing
the cheaters list?

08:00.414 --> 08:03.014
I think people's secrets
are theirs to keep.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.883
Even if they hurt
other people?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.820
I can't let you
tell Lucy, James.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.622
Kara, she trusts me.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.757
Non already knows
where I live.
I don't trust Hank anymore.

08:12.759 --> 08:16.928
Everything is too
complicated and dangerous.
I'm sorry.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.532
Hey, planning a surprise
party for me or something?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.000
(James and Kara laughing)

08:22.002 --> 08:23.468
No, we're just, uh...

08:23.470 --> 08:24.569
We're talking about the...

08:24.571 --> 08:26.004
The package, uh, earlier.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.873
Ugh, don't even
get me started.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.175
There's nothing I hate
more than liars.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.443
(Laughs)

08:31.445 --> 08:33.011
(Static on TV)

08:36.917 --> 08:40.085
Indigo: (On TV)
<i> Greetings, catco employees.</i>

08:40.087 --> 08:42.120
<i> I'm disappointed</i>
<i> in all of you.</i>

08:44.024 --> 08:46.358
<i> Especially you,</i>
<i> queen of all media.</i>

08:46.360 --> 08:50.228
I suppose you're the hacker
that sent the drive
this morning. Hmm.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.898
What do they call you?
The peroxide avenger.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.400
<i> I handed you</i>
<i> the story of the year.</i>

08:55.402 --> 08:59.804
<i> How sinners have turned</i>
<i> the Internet into a modern day</i>
<i> sodom and gomorrah.</i>

08:59.806 --> 09:02.941
<i> But you failed to act.</i>

09:02.943 --> 09:06.611
<i> And so now, all will suffer.</i>

09:06.613 --> 09:10.515
<i> Computers control everything.</i>
<i> Communication, banking...</i>

09:11.485 --> 09:12.984
<i> Even traffic signals.</i>

09:12.986 --> 09:16.121
<i> The age of chaos begins now.</i>

09:18.458 --> 09:20.225
<i> Enjoy.</i>

09:20.227 --> 09:23.828
Toyman Jr.,
you're the computer expert.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.664
Fix this.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.800
I definitely liked it better
when she did not know
who I was.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.873
(Horn honking)

09:36.710 --> 09:38.376
(Beeping)

09:38.378 --> 09:41.212
Every traffic light
in the city just turned green.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.148
-(Sirens wailing)
-Oh, my god.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.897
(Tires screeching)

09:58.899 --> 10:01.333
Liberty Avenue.
There's about to be
a major crash.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.341
Supergirl, get to
Liberty Avenue now.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.548
(Horn blaring)

10:16.550 --> 10:17.916
(Screaming)

10:19.720 --> 10:21.052
(Panting)

10:34.034 --> 10:37.869
Reporter: (On TV) <i> In related</i>
<i> news, the initial attack</i>
<i> on diamonddiscretions.Com</i>

10:37.871 --> 10:41.873
<i> seems now to be</i>
<i> the opening salvo</i>
<i> in a full-fledged cyber war,</i>

10:41.875 --> 10:43.642
<i> which has sabotaged</i>
<i> infrastructure</i>

10:43.644 --> 10:45.977
<i> and left financial</i>

10:45.979 --> 10:49.447
<i> Dozens of banks and lending</i>

10:52.786 --> 10:54.619
<i> -they have ever seen.</i>
-National city mutual.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.755
That's where
my retirement fund is.

10:56.757 --> 11:00.892
If this hacker isn't stopped
soon, we're looking at a
worldwide economic collapse.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.230
Relevant people!
In my office.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.471
National city's
entire mainframe

11:13.473 --> 11:16.341
has been breached
by a cyber-terrorist attack

11:16.343 --> 11:18.410
and nobody knows
why they're doing it,

11:18.412 --> 11:20.445
or who, or when
they will strike again.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.380
I've spoken to my contacts
at the Pentagon.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.182
Military intelligence
is all over this.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.818
This is about national city.
Our home is under attack.

11:26.820 --> 11:30.155
And we have no idea
how this is going to end.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.756
James Olsen.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.158
Yes, ma'am.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.661
First, never call me "ma'am."
This is not the old west.

11:36.663 --> 11:39.197
And second, circle the wagons.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.367
We are going to put
every investigative team
we have on this.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.837
Freelancers too.
We identify the hacker.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.372
We end this.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.442
And you, get my investment
broker on the phone.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.546
-I...
-I'll get him right away,
Ms. Grant.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.917
So where
do you wanna start?

11:58.919 --> 12:01.953
My security clearance
may be back down to that
of a mere civilian,

12:01.955 --> 12:05.190
but I have a senior analyst
at Langley who owes
me a favor.

12:05.192 --> 12:10.261
Yeah, actually, I was just
gonna head out and run down
some old contacts I had.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.596
Anyone I know?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.131
No.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.799
Anyone in a cape?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.203
Luce...

12:18.205 --> 12:21.272
Why is it your first instinct
to work this with Supergirl
and not me?

12:22.809 --> 12:25.276
I'm sorry.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.544
I know things
have been crazy.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.880
And we should get
dinner tonight and talk.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.649
-In the middle
of a major investigation?
-We still gotta eat.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.886
Hey, James, I'm sorry.
Um, but we need
you right away.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.222
Okay.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.323
(Door closes)

12:38.325 --> 12:40.391
-Noonan's.
-Yep, noonan's.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.027
Mmm. Uh...

12:44.965 --> 12:46.598
(Sighs)

12:53.340 --> 12:57.442
You know, he's been mumbling
like that to himself
for over an hour.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.843
Isn't that the first
sign of...

12:58.845 --> 13:00.011
Genius! Yes.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.446
Not mumbling, okay.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.381
I'm writing code,
it just helps to
say it out loud.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.550
All right, winn,
what is happening?

13:05.552 --> 13:07.752
All right.
Okay, look, this hacker...

13:07.754 --> 13:10.922
She has created what's called
an oscillating variable matrix
to cover her footprints.

13:10.924 --> 13:14.626
"Diabolical" would not be
an inappropriate word
choice for her.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.194
-But?
-Winn: But...

13:16.196 --> 13:18.963
I have created an inversion
pathway, which will, um...

13:18.965 --> 13:20.532
Hopefully lead me
to wherever she's hiding.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.301
I mean, she could be,
for all we know

13:23.303 --> 13:25.670
uh, organizing these attacks
from the other side
of the globe.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.639
Indigo: (On laptop) <i> No.</i>

13:27.641 --> 13:30.375
<i> Just the other side</i>
<i> of your screen.</i>

13:30.377 --> 13:33.912
<i> You know,</i>
<i> you're fairly clever,</i>
<i> for an ape.</i>

13:33.914 --> 13:38.349
And you are freaking
me out for an evil blonde
computer face.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.251
<i> Then let's talk in person.</i>

13:40.253 --> 13:41.553
Name the time and place.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.454
<i> How about now?</i>

13:44.291 --> 13:45.824
(Winn screams)

13:50.030 --> 13:52.397
Indigo: Supergirl.

13:52.399 --> 13:56.434
What exactly makes you
so super?

13:56.903 --> 13:58.236
That symbol.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.437
I've seen it before.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.972
It's the sign of my people.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.442
The font of
omniscient knowledge.

14:05.812 --> 14:09.013
I know everything about you.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.584
What are you,
some kind of living Internet?

14:12.586 --> 14:14.152
You might call me that.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.988
(Grunts)

14:27.067 --> 14:30.869
Which one of your friends
should I skin first?

14:30.871 --> 14:33.504
Hold it right there!
Hold it right there!

14:34.241 --> 14:35.506
(Grunting)

14:42.415 --> 14:45.049
Oh, thank god we have our own
personal black ops unit.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.288
Are you following me now?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.323
I wouldn't do that.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.126
We tracked the Wi-Fi signal
from the computers
controlling traffic lights.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.228
There was something else
embedded in the signal.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.931
Something alien.
And it led us right here.

14:59.933 --> 15:04.435
The rest is classified.
Available only to active
deo agents.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.838
What do you say?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.508
I got this far on my own.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.176
Elevator's around the corner.

15:22.055 --> 15:25.690
It's funny, I thought
when I got here
I'd be more nervous.

15:25.692 --> 15:29.527
And yet, you knelt down almost
a minute ago and still
haven't said anything.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.498
Maddie, will you ma...

15:37.637 --> 15:41.539
I would kill both of you but
your world is days away
from ending anyway.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.677
(Thudding)

15:47.280 --> 15:53.351
I calculated the odds of you
locating me at only 26.3%.

15:53.353 --> 15:57.956
But then logic never mattered
much where you and i
were concerned, did it, non?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.993
Where have you been lurking?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.494
To think...

16:03.496 --> 16:07.098
I was once linked
to the great coluan
cyber construct.

16:11.638 --> 16:16.641
And now I wander
the same realm as <i> candy crush.</i>

16:18.178 --> 16:22.447
By the way, I call myself
indigo these days.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.681
Non: It suits you.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.284
Far more than
brainiac 8 ever did.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.119
I am my own woman now.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.956
I hear you're your own
man again.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.459
Is that your idea
of condolences?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.694
Ugh. Not at all.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.663
I despised astra.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.566
I'm glad she's dead.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.535
Why?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.004
Did you need a hug?

16:46.006 --> 16:48.506
My wife
was an exceptional woman.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.309
Really?

16:51.311 --> 16:56.147
Her pathetic devotion
to myriad didn't land
her the throne.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.949
Myriad works.

16:57.951 --> 17:02.487
And, very soon, astra's dream
for what earth can become
will be reality.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.189
I was once your dream.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.627
(Gasps)

17:10.797 --> 17:14.499
I forgot how much
you enjoy a good choking.

17:14.501 --> 17:18.069
You have only
revealed yourself
because astra is dead.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.303
Why?

17:22.509 --> 17:25.176
To prove to you
that her ludicrous plan

17:25.178 --> 17:29.313
of living alongside the humans
should die with her.

17:29.315 --> 17:34.185
No matter the world,
predators cannot live
with prey.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.655
I know you of old.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.891
What have you done?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.528
Just enough.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.663
I turned the wheel.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.465
Hell is coming to earth.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.701
And when it does,
only the Kryptonians
and I will survive it.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.641
See you after the apocalypse.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.558
Whoa, what are you
doing there?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.593
What does it look
like I'm doing?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.895
It's like you're re-enacting
a scene from <i> office space.</i>

18:17.897 --> 18:20.064
Or just trying to murder
my copier.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.633
Can one thing
in my life actually work?
Just one thing.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.735
That's all I'm asking.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.104
(Sighs)

18:26.106 --> 18:28.139
See? There's
no need for violence.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.210
(Winn exhales deeply)

18:33.346 --> 18:35.413
"Thank you" would be nice.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.814
Why?

18:36.816 --> 18:39.417
So I can pretend to be nice
like everyone else?

18:39.419 --> 18:42.854
You know, they just pretend
that you're their friend,
or that you can count on them,

18:42.856 --> 18:46.557
or that they won't cheat
on your mom anymore,
but it's just pretend.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.061
The...
That cheating website...

18:50.063 --> 18:53.331
That was your dad?

18:53.333 --> 18:56.134
Apparently, he was, like,
a platinum member, too.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.336
When I was 17,

18:58.338 --> 19:01.472
I walked in on my father
with his personal assistant

19:01.474 --> 19:05.476
assisting him with something
no daughter should
have to see.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.114
The next day, he told me
how sorry he was.

19:10.116 --> 19:13.751
And how he loved my mom
more than anything.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.288
And that he would never
do it again.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.658
He actually cried.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.126
(Scoffs)

19:23.897 --> 19:26.197
-I'm sorry, if you wanna...
-No.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.900
I need 14 copies of that.

19:28.902 --> 19:31.235
You tell anyone about
my father and I'll kill you.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.273
Uh, good share.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.114
Winn: Uh-oh.
I'll get Kara.

19:43.116 --> 19:45.383
Kara: Um, Alex.
(Sighs)

19:45.385 --> 19:48.386
I thought we had
been over this. I'm out.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.487
I know.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.889
I didn't come for you.
I came for winn.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.958
-You what?
-You what?

19:53.960 --> 19:57.428
He's got better grasp
on python 6 malware encryption
than anybody at the deo.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.365
If we want to
permanently disable
this alien cyber threat,

20:01.367 --> 20:03.467
he's our best shot.

20:03.469 --> 20:07.171
I... I definitely will not go,
if you don't want me to.
I don't have to.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.173
No, no. It's fine.

20:09.175 --> 20:12.109
Just because I stepped away
from the deo doesn't mean
you can't step in.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.279
We're both
still on the same side.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.350
Okay...

20:27.093 --> 20:28.326
What was that about?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.428
Winn was just drafted
by the deo.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.495
What?

20:31.497 --> 20:33.564
Which means we lost
our best hacker

20:33.566 --> 20:37.068
while we're dealing with
a living extraterrestrial
computer.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.337
And now would be the time
where Hank usually tells me

20:39.339 --> 20:41.138
what we're dealing with
and how to catch it.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.640
(Sighs)

20:42.642 --> 20:45.643
If it is alien, how do we get
any info on it?

20:45.645 --> 20:49.413
Well, there is one place
we can go to find out
about aliens.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.826
(James grunts)

21:03.096 --> 21:04.762
Oh!

21:04.764 --> 21:08.366
Anybody ever tell you
that you're a lot faster
than your cousin?

21:09.202 --> 21:11.535
-No, actually.
-Well, you are.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.538
(Panting) But your turns
are kind of sharp.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.341
Hey, no one likes
a backseat flier, okay?

21:18.578 --> 21:21.279
So, uh, how do we get in?
Where is it?

21:21.281 --> 21:24.215
Is there, like,
a secret password?

21:24.217 --> 21:25.816
(Laughing)

21:33.026 --> 21:34.392
Seriously?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.627
He just keeps the key
under the doormat?

21:36.629 --> 21:39.630
It's a million tons
of condensed dwarf star.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.832
He said only a select few
can pick it up.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.334
So...

22:11.631 --> 22:14.332
James: Welcome
to the fortress of solitude.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.349
Oh, hey, that's the pod
that brought Kal-El...

22:32.118 --> 22:34.452
Clark, to earth.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.155
Can't believe Clark
never invited you here.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.857
He did.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.659
A lot, actually.

22:41.661 --> 22:45.429
But I always came up with
an excuse not to come.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.235
I thought it would remind
me of Krypton and
make me homesick.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.471
We don't have to stay here.
We can figure
out another way to...

22:53.473 --> 22:55.306
No, no, it's fine.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.577
How does this place work?

22:59.579 --> 23:01.545
Actually, I was hoping
you could tell me.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.514
(Beeps)

23:03.516 --> 23:05.983
<i> Hello, Kara Zor-El.</i>
<i> How can I help you today?</i>

23:05.985 --> 23:09.153
-You know him?
-I, uh... we had these
back on Krypton.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.589
They served
as robotic helpers.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.257
Kelex, can you
tell us anything

23:13.259 --> 23:17.395
about an obnoxious
blue alien species that
works with computers?

23:17.397 --> 23:19.463
<i> Your description</i>
<i> matches the coluans.</i>

23:19.465 --> 23:21.966
<i> A highly intelligent race</i>
<i> from the planet colu.</i>

23:21.968 --> 23:24.435
<i> They served as</i>
<i> supercomputers on Krypton,</i>

23:24.437 --> 23:26.470
<i> responsible for running</i>
<i> day-to-day operations.</i>

23:26.472 --> 23:28.606
That explains
the cyber terrorism.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.075
Were any of them
prisoners on fort rozz?

23:31.077 --> 23:32.877
<i> One. Her name is indigo,</i>

23:32.879 --> 23:35.246
<i> a descendant</i>
<i> of the brainiac clan.</i>

23:35.248 --> 23:39.116
<i> She was captured while</i>
<i> attempting to shut down</i>
<i> Krypton's defense system.</i>

23:39.118 --> 23:40.785
What was she planning?

23:40.787 --> 23:44.221
<i> Her objective, terminate the</i>
<i> entire planet's population.</i>

23:44.223 --> 23:48.692
<i> She was deemed the most</i>
<i> dangerous prisoner ever</i>
<i> sentenced to fort rozz.</i>

23:49.896 --> 23:52.630
Think we should run this
by director henshaw?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.266
No. No.

23:55.268 --> 24:00.137
Kara, I know you're
upset with him for what
he did. I would be too.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.473
But that doesn't mean
you have to fight this alone.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.976
I'm not alone.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.077
I'm with you.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.819
Come here.

24:14.821 --> 24:18.355
Okay, so, an alien living
computer is trying to
infiltrate the us military.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.191
Now, it's the same
intelligence system

24:20.193 --> 24:23.561
behind the website hack,
and the attack on the city.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.396
And how do you know this?

24:25.398 --> 24:29.033
-From Supergirl.
-You were with
Supergirl last night?

24:31.137 --> 24:32.570
Oh, my god. I...

24:32.572 --> 24:34.972
Completely forgot our date.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.775
(Sighs) Yeah.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.211
Yeah, I did. I'm sorry.

24:40.213 --> 24:42.580
So I'll call my father.
I'll have him alert
homeland security

24:42.582 --> 24:45.015
that the military could
be the next cyber target.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.884
Lucy.

24:49.622 --> 24:54.124
Just please try to remember
that I would never do
anything to hurt you.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.260
Then how do you keep
managing to do it?

25:05.738 --> 25:07.905
Kara: Lucy.

25:07.907 --> 25:11.008
So, uh, Ms. Grant's doing
this whole green tea
cleanse this week,

25:11.010 --> 25:14.812
and she rejected
her latte. So, I thought
you might like it.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.347
(Both chuckle)

25:16.349 --> 25:18.015
Thanks, Kara. (Chuckles)

25:19.585 --> 25:21.051
Are you okay?

25:22.255 --> 25:23.754
I mean... (Sighs)

25:23.756 --> 25:27.057
If James is gonna
stand me up for anyone,
at least it's Supergirl.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.859
Kind of hard to compete
with that, right?

25:28.861 --> 25:33.330
Look, I know you think
James doesn't make your
relationship a priority.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.599
But it's not true.

25:35.601 --> 25:43.707
He's the most caring,
committed, passionate
man I've ever known.

25:43.709 --> 25:48.345
He told me about how his dad
gave him his first camera
before he died in combat.

25:48.347 --> 25:52.950
I just think he's always
trying to live up
to that commitment.

25:52.952 --> 25:56.787
He gives all of himself
to helping people.

25:56.789 --> 26:01.025
In his own way,
i think he's the truest
hero I've ever known.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.460
He never told me that story
about the camera.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.731
-Really?
-Yeah, he never
talks about his dad.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.100
He told you?

26:10.102 --> 26:12.870
Yeah. Yeah,
it was, like, this...

26:12.872 --> 26:16.006
Small conversation,
but you, um, anyway...

26:16.008 --> 26:19.376
I'm just trying to say that
James is an amazing guy.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.546
He could be with
whoever he wants
and he chose you.

26:23.516 --> 26:24.848
Thank you, Kara.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.850
For sharing this.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.852
It helps a lot.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.257
I hope so.

26:35.728 --> 26:38.295
(Sighs) I miss winn and Alex.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.865
I save the world better
when I save it with people.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.969
Well, you are
saving it with me.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.071
(Chuckles)

26:47.073 --> 26:48.806
So, I've been thinking.

26:48.808 --> 26:52.276
Why start with
a sleazy website like
diamond discretions?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.778
What if it's not about
embarrassing people?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.547
What if it was bigger?

26:56.549 --> 26:58.349
General Jonathan mathers.

26:58.351 --> 27:01.752
-Who's that?
-He was doxed during
the diamond discretion hack.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.187
But thousands of people were.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.856
Yeah, but I think he's the
reason it happened.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.225
Why him?

27:11.063 --> 27:13.964
You identified brainiac 8.
You know her code.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.167
If you can successfully
decrypt her signal,
you'll lead us right to her.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.703
You realize that I'm learning
an alien coding language

27:19.705 --> 27:24.942
in the same amount of time
it takes to watch an episode
of <i> doctor who,</i> right? (Scoffs)

27:24.944 --> 27:27.077
That's like...
That's like really fast.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.512
(Keyboard clacking)

27:28.514 --> 27:30.614
I wish Kara was here.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.917
Indigo wasn't looking
to embarrass cheating spouses,

27:33.919 --> 27:36.954
or disrupt traffic
or attack banks.

27:36.956 --> 27:40.557
She was covering for the
fact that the general was
her target all along.

27:40.559 --> 27:44.695
She was looking to declassify
his entire online footprint.

27:44.697 --> 27:45.963
That was the only way to tell.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.232
Tell what?

27:48.234 --> 27:51.468
Which high-ranking official
in national city has access to
nuclear missile launch sites.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.104
-Oh, my god.
-She's going to nuke the city.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.141
Fort Pemberton is the nearest
nuclear missile silo.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.476
But it's completely
off the grid.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.944
No Internet access.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.213
That way, no one can remotely
hack in and launch a missile.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.483
And that is why she needed
the general, to use him
to get into the base.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.918
Like a trojan horse.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.555
Where is general mathers now?

28:21.667 --> 28:22.966
At ease.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.539
(Vault opens)

28:28.541 --> 28:31.008
-Status report?
-Sir, we are at defcon 5.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.710
All systems are nominal.

28:32.712 --> 28:33.877
(Cell phone rings)

28:33.879 --> 28:35.546
There's reception in here?

28:35.548 --> 28:37.648
There shouldn't be.

28:38.451 --> 28:39.616
Mathers.

28:39.618 --> 28:40.984
-Indigo:
<i> Thanks for the ride.</i>
-(Sonic screech)

28:40.986 --> 28:42.252
(Mathers grunts)

28:49.395 --> 28:50.928
(Guns cocking)

28:51.864 --> 28:53.130
(Grunts)

28:54.633 --> 28:57.000
(Groaning)

28:57.002 --> 29:00.204
You can't kill us.
You have to turn
both keys at once.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.271
I know.

29:01.674 --> 29:02.973
(Groans)

29:31.737 --> 29:34.304
I love fireworks.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.475
(Beeping)

29:46.385 --> 29:48.719
Get the Pentagon.
We're at defcon 4.

29:48.721 --> 29:52.523
-I can deploy a strike
team to fort Pemberton.
-You'll never make it in time.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.568
(Grunts)

30:04.570 --> 30:05.702
It's over, indigo.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.271
For the human race?

30:07.273 --> 30:08.539
I agree.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.440
(Both grunting)

30:10.442 --> 30:13.043
Computer: <i> Nuclear launch</i>
<i> sequence activated.</i>

30:13.045 --> 30:14.912
(Both grunting)

30:14.914 --> 30:17.481
Computer: <i> 30, 29, 28...</i>

30:20.119 --> 30:21.752
-(Grunting)
-Computer: <i> 24, 23...</i>

30:23.088 --> 30:24.688
(Groaning)

30:30.596 --> 30:32.229
(Groaning)

30:37.203 --> 30:39.403
Computer: <i> Seven, six, five...</i>

30:39.405 --> 30:44.074
-I calculate the death toll at
7 million. Give or take.
-Computer: <i> Three, two, one.</i>

30:48.480 --> 30:49.947
(Grunts)

30:49.949 --> 30:51.582
(Supergirl panting)

30:57.489 --> 31:00.524
Missile's arching
toward national city.
Eta to target three minutes.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.861
That was the white house.
The president just ordered
us to defcon 2.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.164
James! I'm too late.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.267
Indigo launched an icbm
at national city.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.269
We need to evacuate
catco and the city.

31:12.271 --> 31:15.305
There's no time.
I'm on its tail.
I'm going to stop it.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.981
We got a bogey.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.617
What the hell is that?

31:28.487 --> 31:29.753
That's my sister.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.370
It won't change course.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.138
I'll use my heat vision.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.873
Don't.
That can make it explode.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.913
I've got Supergirl
on the line.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.214
Supergirl: <i> Hank.</i>

31:57.216 --> 31:58.916
I need your help.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.751
We're tracking you
with the icbm.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.754
We're gonna stop this thing,
Kara. Together.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.390
<i> You need to shut down</i>
<i> its onboard flight computer.</i>

32:10.095 --> 32:11.561
(Grunting)

32:18.337 --> 32:20.037
You need to shut down
the silo's network.

32:20.039 --> 32:22.072
Keep indigo from launching
another warhead.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.908
I think that I might have
a way of actually
shutting her down.

32:24.910 --> 32:29.279
I accidently created
a pretty nasty computer
virus a few years ago.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.781
How nasty?

32:36.922 --> 32:39.389
Rip off the trap door
to access the flight computer.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.924
28,000 feet and dropping.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.060
(Beeping)

32:47.166 --> 32:48.398
(Panting)

32:48.400 --> 32:49.800
Alex: 14,000 feet.

32:49.802 --> 32:53.036
Input the kill code 1-1-7-4-7.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.575
(Grunts)

33:03.082 --> 33:04.715
8,000 feet.

33:04.717 --> 33:05.782
Supergirl.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.659
(Grunts)

33:18.397 --> 33:19.496
3,000 feet.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.964
You're out of time!

33:23.235 --> 33:24.501
(Beeping)

33:35.180 --> 33:37.014
Yes!

33:42.454 --> 33:44.187
(Panting)

33:44.189 --> 33:46.156
(Grunting)

33:46.158 --> 33:47.891
Plenty of missiles left.

33:47.893 --> 33:50.127
Thank god for
nuclear proliferation.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.663
(Groaning)

33:53.665 --> 33:55.932
(Panting) Bet you
didn't calculate that.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.869
-How's it coming?
-Thirty more seconds.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.604
Hold on, Kara!

34:00.606 --> 34:02.072
<i> Kara, do you copy?</i>

34:02.074 --> 34:05.876
Indigo: Who is that
you're talking to?

34:05.878 --> 34:09.446
I knew you were too stupid
to be working alone.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.621
(Choking)

34:18.824 --> 34:21.591
Indigo: <i> I am beyond a body.</i>

34:21.593 --> 34:24.194
I am beyond time and space.

34:24.196 --> 34:30.500
All I have to do
is squeeze my fingers,
and your friend dies.

34:31.970 --> 34:33.970
I'm invincible.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.939
<i> I am a god.</i>

34:35.941 --> 34:39.576
No. You're just a glorified
windows vista.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.481
(Groaning)

34:44.483 --> 34:45.982
(Gasping)

34:48.420 --> 34:49.953
(Grunting)

34:52.891 --> 34:54.524
(Panting)

34:54.526 --> 34:56.226
What have you done to me?

34:56.228 --> 34:59.663
I just fed you a major
helping of malware.
Bon appetit.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.099
(Panting)

35:04.069 --> 35:05.469
You.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.705
(Panting) You wouldn't even
be here if it wasn't for me.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.807
What do you mean?

35:10.809 --> 35:14.044
How do you think fort rozz
escaped the phantom zone?

35:14.046 --> 35:18.782
For decades, I searched
the phantom zone with my mind.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.818
<i> Looking for a way out.</i>
<i> And then... I found you.</i>

35:21.820 --> 35:23.753
<i> I activated your pod.</i>

35:23.755 --> 35:27.157
<i> I linked it to the prison.</i>

35:27.159 --> 35:31.194
I'm the reason
you made it to earth.

35:31.196 --> 35:37.200
You would still be sleeping
in that timeless void,
if it wasn't for me.

35:41.573 --> 35:42.973
(Screams)

35:44.977 --> 35:47.511
Are you okay over
there, Supergirl?

35:47.513 --> 35:48.778
(Exhales sharply)

35:49.915 --> 35:51.181
Yeah.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.849
Yeah, I'm good.

35:58.423 --> 35:59.789
Hey, hey!

35:59.791 --> 36:02.459
Siobhan, I really think
that we should talk.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.594
That makes one of us.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.795
You know what,
after the day I've had,

36:05.797 --> 36:07.130
I'm a lot less
frightened of you.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.134
Okay, not that much less.

36:11.136 --> 36:18.175
Look, um, so I...
I thought that my family
was perfect too.

36:18.177 --> 36:22.212
And then my dad went bananas
and tried to kill someone.

36:22.214 --> 36:24.714
And then actually did kill
some other people.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.516
And he went to jail.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.318
My mom took off.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.987
And, then,
you know, so much for the
American nuclear family.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.390
So you're telling me
it could be worse?

36:33.392 --> 36:35.458
Oh, also, that...

36:35.460 --> 36:39.029
That I know how it feels

36:39.031 --> 36:41.565
when someone like that
lets you down.

36:41.567 --> 36:45.135
But I think... I just think
it's important for you
to know that

36:45.137 --> 36:47.637
most people
wanna be there for you.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.485
You tell anybody about this,
and I'll kill you.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.387
-You threaten
to kill me a lot.
-(Elevator bell rings)

37:04.389 --> 37:06.456

37:21.540 --> 37:23.340
No.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.877
Too close.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.679
But we're lucky
to have Supergirl.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.382
(Kara clears throat)

37:32.384 --> 37:35.952
Ker-rah,
cancel my dinner plans.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.823
I am going home to hug my son
and cook him chicken.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.227
You okay?

37:45.297 --> 37:47.264
(Sighs) Yeah.

37:47.266 --> 37:52.135
Yeah, my heart's still racing
from chasing after
a zig-zagging missile.

37:52.137 --> 37:55.238
I kinda felt like Harry Potter
playing Quidditch.

(Chuckles)

37:59.211 --> 38:01.444
Um...

38:01.446 --> 38:04.714
I know I said I didn't want
Lucy knowing my secret
because it's dangerous,

38:04.716 --> 38:06.349
but that's not true.

38:06.351 --> 38:10.186
I know she'd be a great asset
to our team.

38:10.188 --> 38:15.392
I guess I just liked
working together,
just the two of us.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.262
Tell her.

38:23.602 --> 38:24.868
Thank you.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.744
Lucy.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.747
Hey, I have... (Chuckles)

38:37.749 --> 38:41.818
I have something
really important
i wanna tell you.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.021
This is over, James.
You and me.

38:45.023 --> 38:48.358
Uh, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.027
This is... this is not
about Supergirl, right?

38:51.029 --> 38:52.629
No.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.198
And I finally realize that.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.069
Kara came to see me today.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.771
To try and, um, fix things
between us

39:01.773 --> 39:04.741
and convince me of
what a great guy you are.

39:05.277 --> 39:06.409
Okay.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.445
And in case
i didn't already know that,

39:08.447 --> 39:12.949
she mentioned a story
that you told her
about your camera,

39:14.319 --> 39:19.122
your father, to show me
how deeply committed you are.

39:20.325 --> 39:21.925
It's...

39:21.927 --> 39:24.594
-It's not like that.
-We've been together
for so long, James.

39:24.596 --> 39:28.431
And I don't...
I don't know a single thing
about your dad.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.335
Because you never wanted
to tell me.

39:32.337 --> 39:35.672
You wanted to tell her

39:35.674 --> 39:37.774
because you love her.

39:43.749 --> 39:46.549
And for what it's worth,
she, uh...

39:46.551 --> 39:48.218
She feels the same.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.256
Even if she can't
say it yet either.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.365
(Grunting)

40:04.002 --> 40:05.268
(Supergirl clears throat)

40:10.609 --> 40:12.242
It's good to see you.

40:15.414 --> 40:18.782
Well, the world almost ended
'cause we weren't a team.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.019
We need each other.

40:24.489 --> 40:27.991
So, personal feelings aside,

40:28.760 --> 40:30.860
I'm back.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.063
Stronger together?

40:35.801 --> 40:38.868
Well, the first thing
we need to do is assess
if indigo's attack

40:38.870 --> 40:40.937
was related to non's
secret myriad project,

40:40.939 --> 40:42.605
or if the two were working
at cross-purpose...

40:42.607 --> 40:45.375
I saw astra

40:45.377 --> 40:47.544
-standing over j'onn.
-What?

40:47.546 --> 40:48.945
Alex.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.952
(Softly) He was defenseless.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.558
She said she was
gonna give him

41:01.560 --> 41:03.827
an honorable death.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.297
And I reacted.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.434
Because that's
what I was taught to do.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.905
-Hank didn't kill astra.
-(Sobbing)

41:16.575 --> 41:17.907
(Softly) I did.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.043
I did.

41:20.045 --> 41:24.047
And when you got there,
he saw how devastated
you were.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.952
He didn't want you
to get angry with me.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.155
He took the blame.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.859
(Voice breaking)
And I let him.

41:38.964 --> 41:43.399
Because I was
afraid of losing you,

41:44.803 --> 41:46.936
and I can't lose you.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.972
(Alex sobbing)

42:56.808 --> 42:59.075
I merely broke your heart.

43:00.211 --> 43:03.246
Look what
Supergirl did to you.

43:05.650 --> 43:09.953
Now, are you ready
to do things my way?
