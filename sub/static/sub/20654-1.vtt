00:31.196 --> 00:35.394
Once, not long ago,
in deepest Africa,

00:35.467 --> 00:37.230
a great rain forest,

00:38.170 --> 00:42.368
a wild, magical land,
barely touched by humankind.

00:57.656 --> 01:00.921
It's a special day in the dark
heart of this forest.

01:26.919 --> 01:28.648
There's a new life,

01:29.555 --> 01:31.853
a precious baby boy named Oscar.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.821
What's so special
about this little guy?

01:36.195 --> 01:39.323
Well, something truly amazing
will transform his life.

01:40.566 --> 01:43.194
And that's what our
story is all about.

01:49.569 --> 01:55.198
CHIMPANZEE

02:04.790 --> 02:06.815
Beneath this rain forest canopy

02:06.892 --> 02:09.952
is a world that you or I
may never set eyes on.

02:10.963 --> 02:12.624
It's a world with few people,

02:12.698 --> 02:16.600
but still, it's full of drama,
sadness, and joy.

03:49.061 --> 03:50.585
About three months have passed

03:50.662 --> 03:54.189
since little Oscar brought
light into his mother's life.

03:54.533 --> 03:57.593
Isha couldn't be happier
with her new baby boy.

04:02.641 --> 04:05.735
Oscar's world revolves around Mom,

04:05.811 --> 04:08.507
but there are 35 other chimpanzees
in his group

04:08.580 --> 04:10.775
that make a kind of extended family,

04:10.849 --> 04:13.443
and they're never far away.

04:17.789 --> 04:19.552
Perhaps one day Oscar will become

04:19.625 --> 04:21.490
an old-timer like Grandpa,

04:21.560 --> 04:24.085
who will turn 50 this year.

04:25.197 --> 04:27.028
But there are other kids, too.

04:27.099 --> 04:29.693
They'll become Oscar's playmates.

04:29.768 --> 04:31.429
It's a rich society,

04:31.503 --> 04:33.733
but in the heart of the jungle.

04:50.322 --> 04:53.314
Now, Oscar won't be
in his prime until he's over 20,

04:53.392 --> 04:56.259
but one day, he'll look like this big guy.

04:56.328 --> 05:00.628
This is Freddy,
and he's large and in charge.

05:01.233 --> 05:02.928
His white beard shows his years

05:03.001 --> 05:04.992
of wisdom and experience.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.637
Right now, Freddy is untouchable.

05:10.709 --> 05:12.472
And like most alpha males,

05:12.544 --> 05:14.910
he couldn't care less
about the young upstarts

05:14.980 --> 05:17.881
who would just love
to take over his job someday.

05:30.228 --> 05:32.958
Yeah, yeah. Seen it all before.

05:36.702 --> 05:39.762
You need brains
to make a living in this forest.

05:39.838 --> 05:41.829
The jungle toolbox can help,

05:41.907 --> 05:44.740
but only if you're bright
enough to use it.

05:50.015 --> 05:53.143
Sometimes it just takes
a little home-schooling

05:53.218 --> 05:55.846
available from your friends and family.

05:58.223 --> 06:00.487
See? Like this.

06:00.759 --> 06:02.488
Right there.

06:05.931 --> 06:08.627
Even Rufus catches on, eventually.

06:10.402 --> 06:12.893
There you go. Bugs on a stick.

06:19.144 --> 06:22.602
It's finally time for Oscar
to leave his mother's side.

06:30.756 --> 06:34.522
For Isha 's little boy,
this is independence day,

06:34.593 --> 06:37.687
and independence
comes one step at a time.

07:00.085 --> 07:03.020
Well, that's enough
independence for one day.

07:15.567 --> 07:19.503
Oscar's forest home is a prime
piece of chimpanzee real estate

07:19.571 --> 07:23.632
that appears rich and lush,
but it's a hard place to make a living.

07:24.676 --> 07:27.338
The jungle itself is a living,
breathing thing

07:27.412 --> 07:29.437
that doesn't want to be eaten.

07:52.504 --> 07:54.631
Finding food here is a full-time job

07:54.706 --> 07:56.435
that involves the whole family,

07:56.508 --> 07:58.100
including Oscar.

07:58.677 --> 07:59.939
Now that he's grown up a little,

08:00.011 --> 08:02.445
he can start to explore on his own.

08:04.216 --> 08:06.684
But he's not above
catching a lift when he can.

08:06.751 --> 08:10.187
Really, why walk
when you can hitch a ride?

08:10.422 --> 08:12.322
Keep it moving, Mom.

08:14.159 --> 08:16.423
Freddy leads the search for breakfast.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.191
It helps to have someone who
knows where they're going,

08:19.631 --> 08:23.727
especially when the restaurant
is never in the same place.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.475
Today the diner isn't even
in the same neighborhood.

08:39.551 --> 08:41.542
To find the fruit they'll need,

08:41.620 --> 08:44.087
they will have to travel much further

08:44.155 --> 08:46.180
and take a risk.

08:52.697 --> 08:54.756
Freddy knows the only fruit
available now

08:54.833 --> 08:57.529
is on the far side of their kingdom,

08:57.602 --> 09:00.036
out of their safe zone.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.473
This border has been
a battleground for generations.

09:10.482 --> 09:13.383
Everyone is on maximum alert

09:13.552 --> 09:15.952
and treads as quietly as possible.

09:27.832 --> 09:31.290
Freddy is leading them close
to their greatest enemies.

09:32.804 --> 09:35.068
This ridge marks the start of territory

09:35.140 --> 09:37.734
owned by a group
of rival chimpanzees.

09:48.987 --> 09:51.979
The forbidden fruit is finally in reach.

10:12.577 --> 10:15.273
Shh, Oscar. Shh.

10:41.373 --> 10:44.934
Freddy sees his team
are outnumbered two to one.

10:48.179 --> 10:50.579
The enemy has a formidable leader,

10:51.416 --> 10:52.849
Scar.

10:53.785 --> 10:55.309
He and his team have had Freddy

10:55.387 --> 10:57.548
in their sights for years.

11:00.425 --> 11:04.759
Oscar clings to Isha.
They dare not make a move.

11:11.236 --> 11:12.828
The rivals have caught their scent.

11:18.243 --> 11:20.609
Oscar and the others
are in real danger.

11:39.864 --> 11:44.392
Scar's drum is a threat.
For Isha, it's run or die.

11:50.141 --> 11:52.109
Freddy leads the escape.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.059
By running off Freddy's group,

12:09.127 --> 12:11.561
their enemies have claimed
a small victory.

12:11.629 --> 12:12.994
But that's just the beginning.

12:14.032 --> 12:17.968
Scar and his troops are intent
on winning the war,

12:18.036 --> 12:20.027
not just a single battle.

12:25.043 --> 12:26.305
The prize,

12:26.377 --> 12:29.642
a grove of nut trees
in the center of Freddy's land.

12:31.349 --> 12:35.012
The grove is an oasis of food
in this difficult forest

12:35.086 --> 12:37.611
and one that Scar's army
has to conquer

12:37.689 --> 12:40.522
if they're going to survive and thrive.

12:55.373 --> 12:59.036
Isha knows that Scar
is the greatest threat to little Oscar,

12:59.110 --> 13:01.840
and the run-in
was too close for comfort.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.745
She'll do everything possible
to keep her son safe.

13:19.764 --> 13:23.325
Oscar will rely on his mother's
milk for a good while yet,

13:24.135 --> 13:26.399
and to keep that milk flowing

13:26.471 --> 13:29.634
Isha relies on the rich nuts
in Freddy's kingdom.

13:37.649 --> 13:42.109
The magnificent nut groves,
so sought-after by Scar,

13:42.187 --> 13:44.553
thrive here because of the rich soil,

13:44.622 --> 13:46.749
and another magic ingredient,

13:48.126 --> 13:49.787
life-giving water.

15:03.101 --> 15:06.901
Beneath the waterfall,
in the heart of Freddy's territory,

15:06.971 --> 15:08.598
the nuts are coming into season

15:08.673 --> 15:11.164
and it's time for a feast.

15:22.754 --> 15:26.383
They're delicious, nutritious,
and you can't eat just one.

15:29.193 --> 15:32.094
It seems impossible to have too many.

15:32.764 --> 15:36.097
But how do you carry them
without a bag?

15:36.701 --> 15:38.965
You've got to be creative.

15:40.071 --> 15:43.040
Hmm. Put them over in this hand.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.473
Anybody watching this?

15:48.179 --> 15:50.613
The ripest nuts can be sniffed out.

15:51.249 --> 15:54.241
But these are also
the hardest to break into.

15:57.322 --> 16:01.156
They require the right tool
for the right job.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.208
It looks easier than it is,

16:18.276 --> 16:21.734
and the technique takes these
guys many years to master.

16:24.048 --> 16:27.176
Yeah, here we go. Yum, yum.

16:39.297 --> 16:42.755
Sometimes the best tool
for getting nuts isn't a tool at all.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.859
Yup, it's good old Mom.

16:48.106 --> 16:50.097
It's a pretty sweet deal.

16:50.575 --> 16:53.703
But Mom will only help out
for a couple of years.

16:53.778 --> 16:56.975
Then they'll have to take
a shot at it themselves.

16:58.950 --> 17:02.044
Really, how hard can it be?

17:03.421 --> 17:05.719
Oscar is in nut preschool.

17:08.826 --> 17:11.192
There's something wrong
with this hammer.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.355
It won't hit the nut!

17:15.700 --> 17:18.863
Yup, definitely the hammer.

17:22.507 --> 17:25.031
Of course. A bigger one!

17:42.393 --> 17:44.054
This is defective!

17:44.996 --> 17:47.157
They just don't make logs
like they used to.

17:53.171 --> 17:56.470
All right. It has to be the nut.

18:08.519 --> 18:12.421
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
They're using rocks?

18:12.490 --> 18:14.822
No one said anything about rocks.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.252
Oh, I get it.
They must be harder than wood.

18:29.807 --> 18:33.538
Mr. Nut, meet Mr. Rock.

18:35.012 --> 18:36.809
Come to Papa.

18:41.385 --> 18:44.946
Yes! Okay, that's one.

18:51.429 --> 18:53.021
Now Oscar's out of nuts.

18:53.097 --> 18:55.930
He'll have to leave
his hammer to stock up.

18:59.337 --> 19:00.861
Rookie mistake.

19:01.839 --> 19:04.171
I had an eye on that kid all day.

19:04.909 --> 19:06.399
What an idiot.

19:17.188 --> 19:19.281
After all those nuts,

19:19.357 --> 19:21.985
nobody's swinging through the trees.

19:22.059 --> 19:25.620
Yes, it's time to rest and digest.

19:25.696 --> 19:28.324
Even our boy Oscar's knocked out.

19:33.538 --> 19:37.338
It can take hours
to sleep off a big meal,

19:37.408 --> 19:40.104
but the jungle never rests.

20:02.533 --> 20:03.864
In the heat of day,

20:03.935 --> 20:07.837
the parents just want a few
minutes of peace and quiet,

20:07.905 --> 20:10.203
but the kids have other ideas.

20:10.274 --> 20:13.072
Especially Oscar.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.807
Come on up, guys!

20:28.726 --> 20:31.752
A million trees in this forest

20:31.829 --> 20:34.855
and you have to play over me.

20:41.005 --> 20:45.669
I'm sleeping. I am still sleeping!

21:20.077 --> 21:23.706
Poor Isha. Just look at her.

21:23.781 --> 21:26.841
She really does have
her hands full with Oscar,

21:27.518 --> 21:30.078
but her patience
never seems to run out.

21:31.022 --> 21:33.820
Oscar's one lucky young chimp.

21:52.810 --> 21:55.506
Scar and his thugs
are a growing threat.

21:57.281 --> 21:59.977
Food is still scarce in their territory.

22:00.551 --> 22:02.314
If nothing changes,

22:02.386 --> 22:05.822
they'll be forced to make
a move on the nut groves.

22:06.724 --> 22:08.589
If they succeed,

22:08.659 --> 22:10.889
Freddy and his group will be exiled

22:10.961 --> 22:13.555
from their homeland forever.

22:17.268 --> 22:21.329
The aging Scar is under
constant pressure from within.

22:22.206 --> 22:24.800
The males in his team are so powerful

22:24.875 --> 22:27.708
that any one of them could
challenge him as leader,

22:27.778 --> 22:29.370
and he knows it.

22:33.284 --> 22:36.253
Grooming helps hold
this volatile team together

22:36.320 --> 22:39.289
and reminds everyone who's boss.

22:39.357 --> 22:43.054
Without it, there would be anarchy.

22:57.575 --> 23:00.840
This hierarchy may hold
in the short term,

23:00.911 --> 23:04.176
but how long can Scar
count on his men?

23:12.990 --> 23:14.048
Far to the west,

23:14.125 --> 23:17.822
a special fruit has come into
season beneath the waterfall.

23:18.596 --> 23:20.427
Sacoglottis.

23:20.498 --> 23:21.931
Trying saying that three times fast.

23:28.038 --> 23:30.666
Freddy knows the fruit is a real bonus,

23:30.741 --> 23:33.232
so it's best to make the most of it.

23:35.846 --> 23:39.145
Isha collects a private stash
for herself and Oscar.

23:51.762 --> 23:54.196
Remember to wash your food
before eating it.

24:03.374 --> 24:05.740
Once washed,
the fruit is chewed to a pulp

24:05.810 --> 24:08.404
so all the goodness can be sucked out.

24:09.146 --> 24:12.946
You can do it without teeth.
No wonder Grandpa likes them!

24:13.584 --> 24:15.347
That's a good look.

24:15.419 --> 24:18.252
Not a lot of family photos
with Grandpa.

24:19.023 --> 24:20.615
Very appetizing.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.051
When the fruit is sucked dry,

24:25.129 --> 24:26.756
rinse and repeat.

24:29.166 --> 24:32.624
Wow, that is some good Sacoglottis!

24:46.116 --> 24:50.416
Finally, this is something Oscar can
eat without his mother's help.

24:50.488 --> 24:54.185
But it's anyone's guess where
the next meal is coming from.

25:04.635 --> 25:06.603
With the fruit running low,

25:06.670 --> 25:10.071
Freddy's family resorts
to another source of food.

25:10.140 --> 25:13.507
Like us, they eat fruits,
vegetables, and meat.

25:14.845 --> 25:18.906
But their choice in meat is something
that just might surprise you.

25:42.206 --> 25:43.571
Monkeys.

25:46.277 --> 25:48.541
The males take up the hunt.

25:49.179 --> 25:50.669
They split up.

25:51.115 --> 25:52.639
Fanning out through the forest,

25:52.716 --> 25:54.741
they take up their places.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.578
Freddy is at center stage.

26:02.226 --> 26:04.956
Oscar and Isha watch
from the sidelines.

26:10.601 --> 26:14.002
These colobus monkeys
are being hunted.

26:15.205 --> 26:17.673
Smaller and lighter
than the chimpanzees,

26:17.741 --> 26:19.766
they can run on thinner branches,

26:19.843 --> 26:22.835
and this makes the hunt
much more challenging.

26:30.688 --> 26:31.882
Freddy holds back.

26:31.956 --> 26:33.514
This operation requires planning,

26:33.591 --> 26:35.650
and everyone has a role to play.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.393
One by one,
they silently take their positions.

26:52.576 --> 26:55.067
The monkeys still haven't seen them.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.745
Now, the blockers move up.

27:11.295 --> 27:13.263
They're supposed to be seen,

27:13.330 --> 27:15.230
and take a position in clear view.

27:19.370 --> 27:20.962
Another blocker.

27:21.472 --> 27:23.064
Another escape route closed.

27:27.711 --> 27:29.679
Freddy climbs carefully.

27:30.214 --> 27:31.977
He must not be seen.

27:38.222 --> 27:39.712
As ambusher,

27:39.790 --> 27:42.884
Freddy will stay hidden
until he makes the grab.

27:52.102 --> 27:53.330
Perfect.

27:58.976 --> 28:00.705
Now, for the driver.

28:00.778 --> 28:04.179
He'll push the monkeys
towards the ambusher.

28:24.101 --> 28:25.261
Ready,

28:25.903 --> 28:27.097
steady,

28:28.605 --> 28:29.629
go!

28:39.750 --> 28:41.342
They've got one!

28:47.157 --> 28:49.557
Freddy takes the best for himself.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.562
After the initial scramble,

28:55.632 --> 28:58.066
the group settles in for the feast.

29:01.138 --> 29:05.165
For Oscar, it's time to try to
win a seat at the adult table.

29:06.376 --> 29:08.003
Shares get dished out first to those

29:08.078 --> 29:11.070
that helped in the hunt
or as payback for favors.

29:11.148 --> 29:13.173
But no matter how hard you try,

29:13.250 --> 29:15.912
there's always someone
who feels shortchanged.

29:22.626 --> 29:24.719
The females couldn't care less.

29:24.795 --> 29:27.423
When it comes
to guarding meat from the guys,

29:27.498 --> 29:29.466
girl power usually wins.

29:32.169 --> 29:34.000
Back up, big boy.

29:43.981 --> 29:46.950
It's always good to add
a little fiber to your diet,

29:47.017 --> 29:49.247
so don't forget the side salad.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.232
As usual, Oscar was last in line,

30:05.302 --> 30:07.429
so he missed the main course.

30:07.738 --> 30:10.332
He'll have to settle
for his mother's milk.

30:10.407 --> 30:13.706
He may not be the most popular
little boy with everyone,

30:13.777 --> 30:17.042
but his mother's love
is something he can count on.

30:26.023 --> 30:30.119
With dusk approaching, leopards will
soon prowl the forest floor.

30:30.194 --> 30:32.287
If Isha and Oscar want to sleep safely,

30:32.362 --> 30:34.387
the only way is up.

30:54.384 --> 30:57.945
Young, flexible branches
can be woven into a platform.

31:05.596 --> 31:08.793
And leaves from the same tree
will do for bedding.

31:26.016 --> 31:28.985
Now, that's comfort.

31:38.896 --> 31:42.024
Like most kids, Oscar hates bedtime.

32:02.753 --> 32:06.849
Finally, Isha 's little rascal hits the sack.

32:24.875 --> 32:26.900
Even if the kids let you sleep,

32:26.977 --> 32:30.435
there's a good chance
the neighbors will keep you awake.

32:36.086 --> 32:37.849
Ah, please...

32:44.795 --> 32:46.524
Are you kidding me?

32:49.866 --> 32:51.959
You know, frogs are edible.

32:58.108 --> 33:00.406
Here we go.

33:49.826 --> 33:52.818
Isha and Oscar go downstairs
the exciting way.

34:04.841 --> 34:07.309
Early morning, just after breakfast,

34:07.377 --> 34:11.780
is the best time of day to strengthen
friendships with a little grooming.

34:20.657 --> 34:24.388
The bonds between Freddy's team
are more important than ever.

34:25.896 --> 34:28.831
The group is far smaller
than Scar's rival army

34:28.899 --> 34:30.924
and teamwork is their best chance

34:31.001 --> 34:34.562
of protecting the nut groves
for the next generation.

34:41.911 --> 34:44.745
Oscar's future is in all their hands.

34:52.255 --> 34:56.214
Far to the east,
just inside Freddy's territory,

34:56.359 --> 34:58.293
a fig tree comes into fruit,

34:58.361 --> 35:00.852
and is an instant hit with everyone.

35:02.532 --> 35:04.625
Figs are a lifeline in the forest,

35:04.701 --> 35:06.669
often fruiting when
there is nothing else to eat.

35:35.332 --> 35:37.926
Scar's gang is mounting a raid.

35:39.836 --> 35:42.498
They've wiped out the fruit
in their own territory

35:42.572 --> 35:45.541
and have crossed the border
to satisfy their hunger.

35:45.976 --> 35:48.171
All other animals scatter.

35:59.022 --> 36:02.116
Even these figs
won't keep them fed for long.

36:02.192 --> 36:04.387
This is just a stepping stone.

36:05.162 --> 36:06.823
When the moment is right,

36:06.997 --> 36:09.431
they will try to take over the real prize,

36:09.499 --> 36:11.023
the nut groves.

36:17.841 --> 36:19.399
Scar's raid on the eastern border

36:19.476 --> 36:21.501
goes unnoticed by Freddy's group.

36:22.812 --> 36:25.975
A new kind of nut is ripening
in the nut groves.

36:26.049 --> 36:28.074
These are far tougher
than the last ones.

36:28.151 --> 36:30.949
It's time to bring in
the heavy equipment,

36:32.155 --> 36:33.315
power tools!

36:47.070 --> 36:50.972
Success with these nuts
is all about the quality of your hammer.

36:53.343 --> 36:57.143
You can steal someone else's
while they're off collecting nuts.

37:00.183 --> 37:03.209
And Freddy is an expert at this.

37:03.286 --> 37:06.380
But, man, is he tough on his tools.

37:06.456 --> 37:09.721
These things are
a community resource,

37:09.793 --> 37:12.990
so can you please
try not to break them?

37:25.041 --> 37:26.474
Safety first!

37:26.543 --> 37:30.172
So please keep hands and feet
clear of rocks at all times.

37:39.122 --> 37:43.286
Chimps have gathered here
to crack nuts for over 4, 000 years.

37:45.095 --> 37:48.622
Nut-cracking is
part of the group's cultural heritage

37:48.698 --> 37:50.859
and is passed through the generations,

37:50.934 --> 37:53.425
especially from mother to child.

37:55.872 --> 37:58.602
Learning, for Oscar,
will be a slow process.

37:59.643 --> 38:02.305
It will be years before he could
even lift a rock like this.

38:04.180 --> 38:07.343
Day after day,
it takes a committed mom to teach him

38:07.417 --> 38:09.851
how to make a living in the jungle.

38:42.652 --> 38:46.520
It will be many years
before Isha 's son can fend for himself.

39:22.225 --> 39:25.217
A gathering storm
excites Scar's forces.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.891
For Freddy's gang,
the rain is less welcome.

39:57.694 --> 40:00.026
Chimps just hate getting wet.

40:19.082 --> 40:21.915
Oscar gets all the warmth
he can from Isha.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.580
Scar and his gang.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.891
The storm is cover for a raid.

41:34.524 --> 41:37.049
This time, they've got them cornered.

41:49.806 --> 41:52.001
Isha and Oscar are in trouble.

42:11.694 --> 42:14.527
Scar's army was overwhelming.

42:21.771 --> 42:24.763
Oscar's group is in disarray
and badly shaken.

42:37.186 --> 42:40.349
In all the chaos,
Oscar lost contact with his mom.

42:42.759 --> 42:44.852
Isha is nowhere to be seen.

43:12.322 --> 43:16.622
Isha has been injured and separated
from the group by Scar's gang.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.685
She will struggle to get back safely.

43:24.067 --> 43:26.968
This is no forest
to be alone in after dark.

43:41.918 --> 43:44.785
Several of Isha 's friends
have been lost to leopards,

43:44.854 --> 43:48.483
often when they have strayed
from the safety of the group.

44:49.619 --> 44:52.110
Isha will never return to her family

44:53.456 --> 44:55.356
or her son.

45:07.336 --> 45:10.169
Oscar doesn't know
about his mother's death

45:10.873 --> 45:12.773
and he searches for her everywhere.

45:19.382 --> 45:23.580
With every hour that slips by,
he becomes more desperate.

45:40.103 --> 45:42.833
Oscar's growing body
needs constant food.

45:43.506 --> 45:47.135
He tries to remember
what his mom did to make their living.

45:47.577 --> 45:49.602
But nothing comes easily without her.

46:13.002 --> 46:14.799
Hours turn into days.

46:15.538 --> 46:18.063
Oscar must spend less time searching

46:18.141 --> 46:20.769
and more time focusing on his survival.

47:29.745 --> 47:32.543
Hunger drives Oscar to a bees' nest.

47:33.716 --> 47:37.584
Honey is good food, but he's always
relied on his mom to collect it.

47:45.795 --> 47:49.196
The honey's too deep for small arms to
reach, and the bees are not happy.

47:55.938 --> 47:58.668
Oscar's loss will be Freddy's gain.

48:20.396 --> 48:22.728
The boss takes the biggest
piece of honeycomb,

48:22.798 --> 48:24.732
but there's enough left
for everyone else,

48:26.769 --> 48:29.203
except the little boy who found it.

48:38.881 --> 48:41.441
The forest seems an
increasingly hostile place

48:41.517 --> 48:43.747
for a young, hungry chimpanzee.

48:49.158 --> 48:51.251
The razor-sharp jaws
of these army ants

48:51.327 --> 48:54.626
can strip a frog or a lizard
to the bone in minutes.

48:55.698 --> 48:59.896
Is it really a good idea to eat
something that can eat you back?

49:10.346 --> 49:12.814
Oscar is the first to get bitten.

49:12.882 --> 49:16.283
Without a mother, he'll need to learn
fast from the older chimps.

49:18.054 --> 49:19.919
All right, step one,

49:19.989 --> 49:23.481
make a miniature fishing rod
from a nearby branch.

49:25.361 --> 49:29.422
Step two, cast it in and wait for a bite.

49:30.099 --> 49:33.830
And finally, step three, ants on a stick!

49:34.236 --> 49:35.726
Eat and enjoy!

49:42.712 --> 49:45.180
Boy! That is spicy.

49:54.457 --> 49:55.788
It's ingenious!

49:55.858 --> 49:56.950
They will bite your lips,

49:57.026 --> 49:59.551
but at least the rest of you is safe.

50:10.072 --> 50:12.063
Oscar keeps his distance.

50:12.675 --> 50:16.111
Maybe it's safer
just to pick up tips for another time.

50:36.766 --> 50:39.496
Oscar is losing weight quickly,

50:39.568 --> 50:41.001
and with no one to groom him,

50:41.070 --> 50:42.560
it's becoming harder to keep ticks

50:42.638 --> 50:44.765
and other bugs from his skin.

50:50.713 --> 50:53.238
It's time to accept the simple truth.

50:54.016 --> 50:55.916
Isha isn't coming back.

50:57.086 --> 50:59.316
Oscar has to find a new mother.

51:01.824 --> 51:05.817
But sadly for him, most of the
females have kids of their own

51:05.895 --> 51:08.125
and are unable to help.

51:18.140 --> 51:21.132
Again and again, Oscar is rejected.

51:34.824 --> 51:37.156
Even finding a friend seems hard.

52:04.186 --> 52:05.676
It's hopeless.

52:07.456 --> 52:11.153
Scar and his men may have
taken more than one life that day.

52:47.363 --> 52:49.490
The enemy has returned.

52:49.565 --> 52:52.159
They have eaten all the food
in their own territory

52:52.234 --> 52:55.203
and are now stealing from Freddy's
land to sustain their number.

53:03.179 --> 53:06.444
For Scar, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy.

53:12.054 --> 53:15.148
There is a growing impatience
among Scar's army.

53:15.958 --> 53:18.290
They want to take the nut groves,

53:20.462 --> 53:23.124
and more than one of them
would like to be leader.

53:45.221 --> 53:47.712
Oscar has tried everything,

53:47.790 --> 53:49.655
but he is still alone.

53:56.732 --> 53:59.633
There's only one chimp
he hasn't approached.

54:00.102 --> 54:01.296
Freddy.

54:17.186 --> 54:19.154
By following the leader,

54:19.655 --> 54:21.486
Oscar will at least find the best food

54:21.557 --> 54:23.855
and work out what's safe to eat.

54:24.760 --> 54:28.093
Right now, survival is all that matters.

54:36.205 --> 54:38.799
Freddy is not known for his tolerance,

54:39.808 --> 54:42.003
but Oscar isn't a challenger.

54:42.711 --> 54:45.544
This will be
a new experience for them both.

54:56.458 --> 55:00.155
A gentle acceptance is more than
Oscar could have hoped for.

55:07.069 --> 55:08.502
Being at Freddy's side

55:08.570 --> 55:12.131
should allow him to pick up some
tips on food preparation.

55:22.451 --> 55:24.214
Maybe the big guy's table manners

55:24.286 --> 55:26.584
don't set the best example,

55:26.655 --> 55:28.885
but who's going to tell him off

55:29.692 --> 55:32.092
or pick a fight
with the friend sitting next to him?

56:25.814 --> 56:28.180
As the days pass, Freddy and Oscar's

56:28.250 --> 56:30.582
relationship begins to change.

56:31.387 --> 56:34.151
Until something
extraordinary happens.

56:35.524 --> 56:38.152
Freddy allows Oscar
to ride on his back

56:38.227 --> 56:40.457
as usually only a mother would.

56:52.674 --> 56:55.609
It's a sign of something truly incredible.

56:57.746 --> 57:00.010
Freddy will adopt Oscar.

57:17.866 --> 57:21.063
Just being led to these nuts
would not help Oscar,

57:21.837 --> 57:23.498
but now Freddy steps up

57:23.572 --> 57:26.837
and gives his new friend first pick
of every one he cracks,

57:26.909 --> 57:29.070
just as his mother once did.

57:29.144 --> 57:31.476
The bond between them is growing.

57:56.371 --> 57:59.204
It's Oscar's best meal
since Isha vanished.

58:08.917 --> 58:11.112
The group is waiting for their leader,

58:11.186 --> 58:13.313
but Freddy has a new project.

58:19.094 --> 58:21.392
The learning that stopped short
when Oscar was orphaned

58:21.463 --> 58:23.124
is starting again.

58:23.799 --> 58:27.929
He's with a wise and skilled
chimpanzee who has much to offer.

58:53.562 --> 58:56.053
Forest school is back in session.

59:03.238 --> 59:06.867
Everywhere Freddy goes,
Oscar follows.

59:11.847 --> 59:15.248
And everything Freddy does,
Oscar copies.

59:24.326 --> 59:27.955
Our little boy is
on the fast track to forest knowledge.

59:42.578 --> 59:46.139
Freddy's world may be richer,
thanks to his new friend,

59:46.214 --> 59:50.480
but his commitment to Oscar has left
him no time to patrol his borders.

59:52.955 --> 59:55.082
The change has been noticed.

01:00:06.935 --> 01:00:10.462
Scar and his gang have now
crossed over the ridge.

01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:14.737
They would not usually get this deep
into Freddy's land without opposition

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:17.472
and they intend to take full advantage.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:28.045
The troops need to refuel
before they push on.

01:00:29.491 --> 01:00:32.016
The grand fig tree is being pillaged.

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:36.727
This is the food
that Freddy's group were relying on,

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:42.001
but Scar has no interest
in the needs of his enemies.

01:00:45.273 --> 01:00:48.140
Encouraged by the lack
of resistance at the border,

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:51.407
the intruders are now
deep inside Freddy's land.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:56.814
But there is growing dissent
in the ranks.

01:00:57.686 --> 01:01:01.213
The physical power of
this army is beyond question,

01:01:01.289 --> 01:01:03.917
but the unity of a team can be fragile.

01:01:05.293 --> 01:01:07.022
Scar needs to watch his back.

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:28.281
Freddy has become
completely devoted to Oscar.

01:01:29.785 --> 01:01:32.777
The highest-ranking male
grooming the lowest.

01:01:33.922 --> 01:01:36.356
It's an astonishing turn of events.

01:02:04.786 --> 01:02:07.516
A few weeks ago, Oscar had nothing,

01:02:08.957 --> 01:02:11.118
and now he is well fed
and completely adored,

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.696
and his savior is the last one
anyone could have expected.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.835
The rivals are fed and rested.

01:03:06.548 --> 01:03:09.949
Scar and his mob
are within reach of the nut groves.

01:03:12.954 --> 01:03:16.082
The time for a full invasion has arrived.

01:03:57.465 --> 01:03:59.456
Freddy grooms his allies.

01:04:01.136 --> 01:04:02.899
He knows there is trouble approaching

01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:06.566
and for the first time
in weeks, he appears nervous.

01:04:13.548 --> 01:04:17.541
Friendships need investment,
and his attention has been elsewhere.

01:04:21.489 --> 01:04:24.549
Oscar feels Freddy's focus
drift away from him.

01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:31.689
Freddy must reassure his team
that he is still the boss

01:04:31.766 --> 01:04:34.929
and has the strength
to unite them and lead them.

01:04:42.844 --> 01:04:44.539
Oscar is confused.

01:04:44.613 --> 01:04:48.379
He's lost one parent and
seems to be losing another.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.677
The rivals are close.

01:05:30.025 --> 01:05:33.188
Oscar and the group
sense that something is wrong.

01:05:47.776 --> 01:05:50.006
Something catches Freddy's eye.

01:05:59.521 --> 01:06:01.318
Scar attacks.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.655
The final push has begun.

01:06:19.607 --> 01:06:21.802
Freddy's team can't escape.

01:06:27.816 --> 01:06:29.306
They have to fight.

01:06:29.384 --> 01:06:31.614
But some of Scar's mob hold back.

01:06:37.025 --> 01:06:39.016
Freddy leads the attack.

01:06:49.738 --> 01:06:52.172
Freddy and Scar go head-to-head.

01:07:03.885 --> 01:07:06.012
There can be only one victor.

01:07:29.611 --> 01:07:32.546
Freddy's drum announces victory.

01:07:37.886 --> 01:07:41.344
Scar will not be returning
anytime soon.

01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:45.720
Teamwork has beaten brute force.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:35.466
The group is now thriving,

01:08:35.542 --> 01:08:39.171
unchallenged in their
ownership of the precious nut groves.

01:08:42.951 --> 01:08:44.747
Cracking school continues,

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:47.219
but some students
never seem to catch on.

01:08:52.894 --> 01:08:55.362
Grandpa has lived
to see Scar dealt a blow

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.728
from which he may never recover.

01:09:00.568 --> 01:09:03.537
And Oscar is causing
as much trouble as ever,

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:07.068
but now he's fully
accepted by the group,

01:09:07.142 --> 01:09:09.770
and seems to be
everyone's new friend.

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:18.979
Maybe quiet times are returning at last.

01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.724
Oscar and Freddy
have been transformed

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:27.225
by the turmoil of the last few months.

01:09:28.263 --> 01:09:31.823
For Oscar, the loss of his
mother could have meant the end.

01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:34.130
Instead, it's a new beginning

01:09:34.202 --> 01:09:37.365
with the most unlikely foster parent
in the forest.

01:09:39.107 --> 01:09:40.471
And Freddy?

01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:42.499
He's discovered a softer side

01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:45.068
that must have been there all along.

01:10:02.597 --> 01:10:04.622
Secure in Freddy's arms,

01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:07.998
the future finally looks bright for Oscar.

01:11:56.177 --> 01:11:59.374
When this big male decided
to carry this little orphan

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:01.472
and take care of him and give him food,

01:12:01.549 --> 01:12:03.949
it literally took our breath away.

01:12:05.353 --> 01:12:06.843
For sure, there's no doubt

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:08.946
he saved the life of the little one.

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:11.684
And that was really
very touching to see.

01:12:13.461 --> 01:12:15.827
And when you see a
mother carrying its baby,

01:12:15.897 --> 01:12:17.159
it's charming.

01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:20.291
But when you see this huge,
King Kong-like figure

01:12:20.368 --> 01:12:23.701
carrying this tiny, little,
male orphan around,

01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:24.863
it was lovely.

01:12:26.307 --> 01:12:28.502
Every single day
was an act of beauty

01:12:28.576 --> 01:12:30.510
between the two of them.

01:12:30.578 --> 01:12:32.910
And that's something
you can never forget.

01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:37.375
Sometimes I imagine

01:12:37.452 --> 01:12:38.942
the rest of the world waking up,

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.148
getting on busses,
or they may be getting on subways.

01:12:42.223 --> 01:12:45.818
Our commute to work
is walking for an hour

01:12:45.893 --> 01:12:48.054
through the jungle
to find chimpanzees.

01:12:48.129 --> 01:12:51.121
Some of this stuff is just impenetrable

01:12:51.199 --> 01:12:54.327
and really difficult to move through.

01:12:57.505 --> 01:13:00.133
It really is a joy
to walk through this forest.

01:13:04.045 --> 01:13:05.910
You see, it's not always that easy.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.880
So, we're just walking...

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:17.017
They bite you
in the most remarkable places.

01:13:18.426 --> 01:13:20.758
These sweat bees are driving me nuts.

01:13:20.828 --> 01:13:23.319
Still, at least they're not honeybees.

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:27.095
Ahh! Ow! Ow! Ahh!

01:13:30.805 --> 01:13:32.534
It's gotten intolerable.

01:13:32.607 --> 01:13:33.596
I'm leaving.

01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:35.432
Oh, my God. Ed!

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:38.271
If it bites you, you won't survive.

01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:41.446
It's not a picnic, you know.

01:13:47.622 --> 01:13:48.646
Yes!

01:13:50.892 --> 01:13:53.725
There must be easier ways
to make a living,

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.522
but they're not as much fun.

01:17:50.829 --> 01:18:01.562
THE END
