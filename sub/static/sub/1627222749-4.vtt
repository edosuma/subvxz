WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:06.702
- Listen up, everyone.
We had a murder this morning.

00:06.745 --> 00:09.052
The vic was found at 8:45
by a dog walker

00:09.096 --> 00:10.314
who let herself
into his apartment--

00:10.358 --> 00:11.794
- Oh, my God, it's Franzia!

00:11.837 --> 00:14.014
This is the work of
Johnny Franzia, my white whale.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.102
He's finally resurfaced.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.147
- Not this again.
- Yes, this again.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.062
Johnny Franzia has been
on a murder spree

00:19.106 --> 00:20.411
for the past ten years,

00:20.455 --> 00:22.761
and every time
he kills someone, he taunts me.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.328
Look, there's a deck of cards.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.026
- You say that whenever
there's cards at a crime scene.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.766
You know how many people
own cards, Jake?

00:27.810 --> 00:29.333
- Then explain this.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.205
Johnny Franzia's catchphrase
is "deuces are wild."

00:31.248 --> 00:32.510
Now look around the apartment.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.295
Two chairs, two paintings,
two pillows.

00:34.338 --> 00:35.687
- There are three lamps.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.733
- You think Franzia
gives a damn about lamps?

00:37.776 --> 00:39.169
You sound so dumb right now.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.692
This is why you don't have
an arch nemesis, Terry,

00:40.736 --> 00:42.520
because you focus
on all the wrong details.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.044
- Maybe I don't have
an arch nemesis

00:44.087 --> 00:46.742
because I solve all my crimes.

00:53.314 --> 00:54.924
- That's a pretty [bleep]-up
thing to say to me.

00:58.754 --> 01:05.587
<i>♪</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:16.206
<i>- You wanted to see us,
Captain?</i>

01:16.250 --> 01:17.642
- I'm giving the murder
to someone else.

01:17.686 --> 01:18.774
- What?

01:18.817 --> 01:20.689
You're taking me
off the Franzia case?

01:20.732 --> 01:23.213
My God, he got to you,
didn't he?

01:23.257 --> 01:24.693
- I assure you, he did not.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.477
I had never heard
of Johnny Franzia before today.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.305
- Well, it was mostly
before you arrived.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.264
Actually, you're entire
first year here

01:30.307 --> 01:31.656
I was convinced
you were Franzia,

01:31.700 --> 01:34.572
which I now realize
is completely ridiculous.

01:34.616 --> 01:35.791
Or is it?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.575
- I have no investment
in this backstory.

01:37.619 --> 01:38.924
- Right.
- I'm taking you off the case

01:38.968 --> 01:40.143
because you both asked

01:40.187 --> 01:42.014
for reduced hours
to focus on childcare,

01:42.058 --> 01:44.234
and Santiago has her
big presentation this week.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.888
If our pilot program
to reimagine

01:45.931 --> 01:48.499
how uniformed officers
are deployed gets funded,

01:48.543 --> 01:51.111
it will represent a significant
reform for the NYPD.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.070
- Sir, we can take care of Mac
and still do both of our jobs.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.246
Trust me, we've got this whole
parenting thing figured out.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.075
- It's true.
We're great, and Mac is great.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.772
I mean,
the only teeny-tiny issue

02:00.816 --> 02:02.296
is that he isn't
pulling himself up yet,

02:02.339 --> 02:03.949
but the window for that
is 9 to 12 months.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.821
So the fact that he's 10 months
old and isn't doing it yet

02:05.864 --> 02:07.170
doesn't mean
that we're bad parents.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.781
And I was reading
that Simone Biles

02:09.825 --> 02:11.827
went straight from crawling
to walking.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.611
So, yeah, I guess I should be
"concerned"

02:13.655 --> 02:15.178
that my son
is on the same track

02:15.222 --> 02:16.788
as a multiple
gold medal winner.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.138
I mean, get real, sir.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.447
- So, yeah, Mac's having
a little trouble pulling up,

02:23.491 --> 02:25.797
but did that convince you
to give us more responsibility?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.669
- Look, if you promise
you can handle it,

02:27.712 --> 02:29.540
I'll put you back
on the John Franzo case.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.716
- Franzia.
Johnny Franzia.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.067
How could you forget that?
Unless...

02:35.111 --> 02:36.460
- Get out.
- You got it.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.114
<i>- Thank you for letting me
stay with you, Diaz.</i>

02:38.158 --> 02:39.811
I am sorry for imposing.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.857
I assumed I'd be back
with Kevin by now.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.554
- Oh, couple's therapy
isn't going well?

02:43.598 --> 02:46.383
- Well,
we're not back together,

02:46.427 --> 02:48.124
even after three full sessions.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.647
That's three hours,

02:49.691 --> 02:51.214
more if you include
travel time.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.650
- Why would I include
travel time?

02:52.694 --> 02:54.348
- It's a longer drive for me
than for Kevin,

02:54.391 --> 02:56.219
so I'm putting in more effort.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.916
- Hmm, I wonder why
it's not going well.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.528
- Well, Kevin says it's because
all I care about is work.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.704
But if that's true,
why did I leave work

03:02.747 --> 03:04.749
13 minutes early today
to move in with you?

03:04.793 --> 03:06.273
- Well, you can stay
as long as you like.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.579
You're quiet, you're neat.
You're the perfect roommate.

03:08.623 --> 03:09.972
- I think Kevin would disagree.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.844
He told Dr. Cheryl
I'm a sore loser at Scrabble.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.804
How would he know that
when I win 78% of our matches?

03:15.847 --> 03:18.328
- Wow, you're a lot chattier
than I remember you being.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.721
- Oh, sorry.
I promise--

03:19.764 --> 03:21.940
I won't obsess about Kevin
the whole time I'm here.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.768
- Okay.
Great.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.292
- Although I may break
that promise,

03:25.335 --> 03:26.945
because according to Kevin,
I'm a liar.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.470
- Ah, damn it,
two of clubs is blank.

03:29.513 --> 03:32.124
That's not like him.
So what are we missing here?

03:32.168 --> 03:35.215
Two chairs, two paintings.
Oh, my God, the lamps.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.433
- But you told Terry

03:36.477 --> 03:37.913
that Franzia
didn't care about lamps.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.262
- No, he loves lamps.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.742
I was just feeling attacked,
so I lashed out,

03:40.785 --> 03:43.527
but why three identical lamps
instead of two?

03:43.571 --> 03:45.268
Because they're
not actually identical.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.358
The shade on this one
is darker, and...

03:48.402 --> 03:50.055
- Ooh!
- It's a blacklight.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.579
Yes, frickin' two of clubs.

03:51.622 --> 03:54.234
Turn off the overheads.

03:54.277 --> 03:57.062
Franzia!

03:57.106 --> 03:59.369
- Hey, so don't freak out,

03:59.413 --> 04:01.806
but apparently there
are several other groups

04:01.850 --> 04:04.679
presenting reform proposals
to One Police Plaza,

04:04.722 --> 04:06.289
and only one will get funding.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.769
- Why would that make me
freak out?

04:07.812 --> 04:09.684
- Because you can be
a little competitive.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.251
-
That's not true.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.340
No one is less competitive
than me.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.689
No one.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.953
- Anyway, uh, here's
who you're up against.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.171
- Alan Peters.
Dud.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.303
Mike Lynch.
Dud.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.739
Tad Green.
Dud!

04:21.783 --> 04:23.567
Austin Grant.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.526
- Who's Austin Grant?
Not a dud?

04:25.569 --> 04:27.441
- Oh, he's a dud,
but he's a hot dud.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.616
He's a "hud."

04:28.659 --> 04:30.313
He gets everything
handed to him

04:30.357 --> 04:31.532
because he looks
so good in a uniform.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.273
Ugh, and he's pitching

04:33.316 --> 04:35.013
predictive algorithmic policing.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.798
That's just high-tech
racial profiling.

04:36.841 --> 04:40.323
- Okay, look, if this guy
is style over substance,

04:40.367 --> 04:43.283
we just need to give you
some style.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.937
Check this out.

04:45.981 --> 04:49.376
Tiny Terry won the
Little Mister Michigan pageant.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.768
- You just happen to have
a video of yourself

04:50.812 --> 04:52.292
as a seven-year-old
on your phone?

04:52.335 --> 04:54.294
- Big Terry's proud
of Tiny Terry.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.165
Look, the point is,
I can help you.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.471
- Terry!
Terry!

04:57.514 --> 04:58.559
It's him.
It's really Franzia.

04:58.602 --> 04:59.777
Don't ask how I know

04:59.821 --> 05:01.605
'cause it has nothing
to do with lamps.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.346
- Jake, what are you
doing here?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.869
- What are you doing here?

05:04.913 --> 05:08.090
You're supposed to be
getting Mac from day care!

05:09.613 --> 05:11.093
<i>He's finally down.</i>

05:11.136 --> 05:13.182
Did you miss anything important
with your case?

05:13.225 --> 05:15.271
- Yes, because jokers are wild,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.142
Charles went to the "Joker"
stairs, and there was graffiti

05:17.186 --> 05:19.014
of the victim's name
written on a bus stop.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.798
So Charles got on the bus,
took it to the end of the line,

05:20.842 --> 05:22.322
where there was
a payphone ringing.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.627
He picked it up, and there
was a voice on the other end

05:23.671 --> 05:24.802
that told him a riddle.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.326
- What was the riddle?
- I don't know.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.849
He had to go before he could
tell me because he noticed

05:27.892 --> 05:29.546
that his kitchen window
was mysteriously unlocked.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.331
Stupid Franzia is probably
in his house right now

05:31.374 --> 05:32.723
trying to murder him
and his family.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.682
- At least he's not here
trying to murder me and Mac.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.379
- I appreciate you trying
to make me feel better, Ames,

05:36.423 --> 05:37.772
but we both know
you're grasping at straws.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.644
Thank God.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.690
Charles is fine.
Nobody in the house.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.561
I would have been so jealous.

05:44.605 --> 05:45.954
- I'm sorry, babe.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.738
I'd say I'd take over Mac stuff
for the week,

05:47.782 --> 05:50.262
but I have to rewrite my whole
presentation to be snappier,

05:50.306 --> 05:52.700
and, also, according to Terry,
I need to learn

05:52.743 --> 05:55.006
how to walk with my shoulders
and not my feet.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.269
- It's okay. What you're doing
is super important.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.532
I'll just scale back

05:58.575 --> 06:00.447
and let Charles run point
on the Franzia case.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.840
- No.
None of us are scaling back.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.365
We can be good parents without
sacrificing our careers.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.540
We just have to work as a team.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.802
- You know what?
Yes, you're right.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.281
We got this.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.544
All we need is each other.

06:10.587 --> 06:11.849
- There's been a lice outbreak
at day care,

06:11.893 --> 06:13.416
and they're closing
for the next two days.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.852
- What?
No!

06:14.896 --> 06:16.637
We need so much more
than each other.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.858
- Ugh, damn it.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.599
none of our regular babysitters
are available,

06:22.643 --> 06:23.948
and my parents are out of town,
and my brother David can't help

06:23.992 --> 06:25.602
because he's in
Sudan digging wells

06:25.646 --> 06:27.125
for somebody or something--
I don't know, I hung up on him.

06:27.169 --> 06:28.431
- My dad's out, too.

06:28.475 --> 06:29.867
That's all he said,
didn't give a reason.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.260
Wait, I've got it.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.435
Let's just let Mac
watch TV all day.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.045
- Jake, we've talked
about this.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.439
No screen time for Mac
until he turns two.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.658
Ugh.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.442
All this stress
is making my head itch.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.226
- Yeah, it's weird--I've
actually been itching myself.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.272
- No! Lice!
Scratching it makes it worse.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.447
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.579
We don't have time
to know what's true.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.841
- Okay, okay,
let's just stay calm.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.146
When I had lice
in the fifth grade,

06:48.190 --> 06:49.844
my mom put a bunch
of maple syrup in my hair,

06:49.887 --> 06:51.454
and it smothered them to death,
it was actually kind of cool.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.151
You can hear
their tiny screams.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.805
- No, that's
an old home remedy,

06:54.849 --> 06:56.590
and day care actually
recommends

06:56.633 --> 06:58.896
a place where you go, and they
comb the lice out for you.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.942
I bet we'll be in and out
in 20 minutes.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.379
Six hours?
Who has that kind of time?

07:05.207 --> 07:07.165
- So now what?
-

07:07.209 --> 07:09.777
- I mean, I guess
there is one last option.

07:09.820 --> 07:10.952
- Please don't say it.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.040
- It worked for me
in fifth grade.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.345
- I really don't want to.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.434
- It is kind of cool
to hear the screaming.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.826
- Okay, fine,
we'll do the syrup.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.045
- We're gonna do the syrup!

07:21.745 --> 07:23.791
<i>- ♪ Come on</i>

07:23.834 --> 07:25.357
<i>♪ Oh</i>

07:25.401 --> 07:28.926
- Oh, Amy, what is that
enchanting new perfume?

07:28.970 --> 07:30.667
- It's syrup, Scully.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.453
- And it is working.
Hmm-hmm.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.413
- I think you
just made Scully horny.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.545
- Ugh.

07:38.588 --> 07:39.981
<i>- And then
he called her Cheryl,</i>

07:40.024 --> 07:41.548
not Dr. Cheryl,

07:41.591 --> 07:43.637
a clear attempt
to delegitimize her.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.378
Obviously, I agree,
she has zero legitimacy.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.250
I mean, she calls herself
Dr. Cheryl.

07:48.293 --> 07:51.035
Then Kevin brings up how
Cheddar's French comprehension

07:51.079 --> 07:52.167
has regressed.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.473
Cheddar's tutor says

07:53.516 --> 07:55.126
it's because we're not
speaking enough at home.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.520
The worst part
is we used to share socks.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.957
With an odd number,
that was a tense negotiation.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.524
- Enough!

08:01.568 --> 08:04.048
All you do is talk about Kevin.
This needs to stop.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.963
- I'm sorry--
I wish I could stop thinking

08:06.007 --> 08:08.400
about him, but he was
my husband for 20 years.

08:08.444 --> 08:11.708
If you know how I could just
erase him from my memory,

08:11.752 --> 08:13.231
I'd love to hear it.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.843
- We could get really drunk.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.192
- Yes, let's try that.

08:17.235 --> 08:20.064
- Jake, Jake,
Franzia was in my house.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.326
I didn't see anything
last night,

08:21.370 --> 08:22.763
but when I showered
this morning,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.547
a new riddle appeared
in the steam on the mirror.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.549
- Oh, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.072
I also saw a riddle
while showering.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.596
- But we didn't shower
this morning.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.162
- No, I know, it's just Charles
and I have this agreement

08:31.206 --> 08:32.555
that when I miss something
important on the case,

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
he pretends like I'm still
involved--it's normal.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.125
Anyways, I'm sure our shower
riddles were the same.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.692
- No, I'm sure
yours was better.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.128
- Well, just to be sure,
why don't you text me yours,

08:40.171 --> 08:41.390
and I'll make sure
it's the same as mine,

08:41.433 --> 08:42.565
and then we can decode it
together

08:42.609 --> 08:44.262
after Ames and I find a sitter.
- Great.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.742
- Ooh, we already have
three applicants.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.048
- Great.
Hire them.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.223
- I think we should
interview them first.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.920
- But what if they're bad?

08:49.964 --> 08:51.182
- This really feels like fate

08:51.226 --> 08:53.054
because I was arrested
in this precinct

08:53.097 --> 08:55.056
literally a year ago
to the day.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.928
- Here, I brought a toy
for the little guy.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.147
- Oh, thanks.
That's very nice of you.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.496
- He's so soft.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.151
Your son's really gonna
enjoy cuddling him.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.457
Want to see me cuddle him?
I love cuddling.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.198
- Well, this went south
very quickly.

09:07.242 --> 09:09.026
- I consider myself
a bit of a Mary Poppins.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.462
- Oh, how so?

09:10.506 --> 09:14.118
- ♪ I'm your nanny,
I'll slap your fanny ♪

09:14.162 --> 09:15.685
♪ Slap, slap, slap

09:15.729 --> 09:17.687
♪ Your fat little fanny

09:17.731 --> 09:19.167
- Yeah, it's gonna be a no.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.169
I got to get back to Franzia,

09:21.212 --> 09:23.954
so feels like we should go
with the cuddler.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.956
- No, as much
as I want to work,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.654
we can't leave our son
with some weirdo.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.613
- Maybe we ask someone
in the precinct?

09:30.657 --> 09:33.137
- Everyone's working.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.661
Not everyone.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.097
- Sure, I'll watch Mac.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.490
Don't worry, I've padded
all the sharp edges in here.

09:38.534 --> 09:39.970
- Wow.
You already baby-proofed it?

09:40.014 --> 09:41.319
- Ah, it's my nap room.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.017
You can take a nap
anywhere in here.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.584
Every surface is like a bed.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.673
Huh.
- Works for us.

09:46.716 --> 09:49.371
Okay. Sorry, the babysitter
thing took a little longer

09:49.414 --> 09:50.459
than I was expecting,

09:50.502 --> 09:51.895
but I solved part
of the riddle.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.157
A cat has ten lives.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.116
I think the lives are numbers.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.508
- Wow, that's so smart.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.598
I already solved the riddle.
It's a phone number.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.251
But you're here now.
We can call together.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.644
- Okay, yeah, I guess.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.167
I mean, maybe he'll have

10:03.211 --> 10:04.212
a cool scary modulated voice
or something.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.257
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.651
- Hello.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.870
- Oh, my God, he does.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.828
<i>- You solved my riddle,
Detective Boyle.</i>

10:11.872 --> 10:13.395
- And Detective Peralta!

10:13.438 --> 10:16.050
I'm still on your tail,
and your sick game is finally--

10:16.093 --> 10:17.529
- Help!
Help!

10:17.573 --> 10:18.661
- Oh, seriously?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.794
Uh, Franzia,
I got to go real quick.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.273
<i>- What?
You have to go?</i>

10:22.317 --> 10:24.493
- Boyle will explain,
but I'm still on your tail.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.016
And if you think
the jokers are really wild--

10:26.060 --> 10:27.148
- Jake!

10:27.191 --> 10:28.671
- All right, I'm coming!
Damn it!

10:28.715 --> 10:29.846
- Jake!

10:29.890 --> 10:31.152
- What happened?
- Is Mac okay?

10:31.195 --> 10:32.806
- Mac's fine.
It's me.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.852
There was one unpadded corner,
and I stubbed my toe real bad.

10:35.896 --> 10:36.853
Look.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.289
- Ugh!
- Oh, God!

10:38.333 --> 10:40.552
- I'm sorry, I got to go
to the hospital.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.859
- Yeah, immediately,
for so many reasons.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.382
Come on.
- Gosh.

10:44.426 --> 10:47.211
-
Is he okay?

10:47.255 --> 10:48.865
- He's fine.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.911
- Ames, I'm sorry, but I think
we're all out of babysitters.

10:50.954 --> 10:54.436
- No.
There is one option left.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.568
- His first screen
time, this is amazing.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.614
Which "Transformers" movie
should he watch first?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.050
There's an argument
to be made for "Bumblebee,"

11:00.094 --> 11:01.182
as it is a prequel.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.879
- Jake.
- All right, fine.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.576
Just let it auto-play whatever
garbage it wants, and let's go.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.883
- Okay.
Here you go, Mac.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.232
Here you go.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
Yeah, we deserve that.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.894
- Oh, I am hungover.
How you feeling?

11:17.938 --> 11:19.200
- Not good at all.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.592
You were supposed
to watch out for me, Diaz.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.072
- Good news is,
the heavy drinking worked.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.726
You didn't mention Kevin
one time.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.336
- Oh, that is
an accomplishment.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.730
Unfortunately, it appears

11:27.774 --> 11:30.733
that I did think about him
at least once last night.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.430
- What do you mean?

11:32.474 --> 11:34.476
- At 3:30 a.m.,
I seem to have sent Kevin...

11:36.391 --> 11:38.610
A digital phallus portrait.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.656
- A digital phallus portrait?
What is that?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.658
Oh, no, you sent him
a pic.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.532
- Shh. Shh.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.012
Please stop crying.
I'm so tired.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.710
- Maybe we'd all
be better rested

11:50.753 --> 11:52.320
if we hadn't woken up
at 3:00 a.m.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.235
- I'm sorry, I've never slept
with syrup in my hair before.

11:54.278 --> 11:55.845
I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

11:55.889 --> 11:56.977
- Ants!
Ants in the bed!

11:57.020 --> 11:58.805
- Who?
- There's ants in the bed!

11:58.848 --> 12:00.763
- There's ants!
There's ants!

12:00.807 --> 12:02.243
- My presentation is today,

12:02.286 --> 12:04.811
and I am not showing up
in a shower cap.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.203
What are we gonna do?

12:06.247 --> 12:07.988
- There's only one thing
left to do.

12:08.031 --> 12:11.905
We're gonna blow-dry these sons
of bitches straight to hell.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.994
Got to say, worked great.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.561
Although I guess my hair took
it a little better than yours.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.041
And why the glasses?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.564
- Mac knocked my last contacts
into the toilet

12:19.608 --> 12:20.870
while I was blow-drying.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.350
- Got to hand it to him,
it's a solid prank.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.395
Although I must say, this look
kind of works for you.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.136
- Jake, we don't have time
for your nerd fetish.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.355
We are so late.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.835
- I know.
You know what?

12:28.878 --> 12:30.706
Let's not waste any more time
looking for babysitters.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.490
We'll just take Mac
into work with us.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.014
See, Ames, we got this.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.493
- Yeah, this is
not gonna be hard.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.757
- You want to know why?
'Cause we're great parents.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.237
In fact, we forgot Mac.
We left our child inside.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.804
- Oh.
- Uh, get the keys.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.458
Okay, I'll take Mac first

12:43.501 --> 12:44.851
so you can start practicing
your presentation.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.113
- Okay.
- Jake, I think

12:46.156 --> 12:47.941
I figured something out
about the toolbox.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.856
- Toolbox?
- Franzia sent me a toolbox.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.336
It turned out to be a puzzle.
It was so boring.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.556
- Charles, it wasn't boring.
I know what you're doing.

12:54.599 --> 12:56.776
Just tell me what happened.
- Okay, so I ran it for prints.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.603
And there was a partial
on the wrench.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.214
It belongs to a guy
named Eric Marsh

13:00.257 --> 13:02.085
who works as a handyman
in the victim's building.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.739
- We have to bring him in.
- Already done.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.262
He's in interrogation
right now,

13:05.306 --> 13:07.221
just waiting for you.
- Oh-

13:07.264 --> 13:09.527
But I have Mac
for the next hour.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.529
I can't run an interrogation.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.227
Unless...

13:13.270 --> 13:14.706
- How did your prints end up
on a wrench

13:14.750 --> 13:16.186
that was sent
to this police station?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.840
- That wrench went missing
two weeks ago.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.668
I thought someone took it
out of the back of my truck.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.452
- Of course, that sounds...

13:21.496 --> 13:22.932
- Totally reasonable, Eric.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.847
- Or should I call you
by your real name?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.370
- Johnny Franzia.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.458
- I don't know who that is.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.765
- Uh-oh.
Something stinks.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.333
Something stinks real bad.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.682
Did you poop?
- No.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.902
- You did.
You pooped.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.947
- Oh, God, it's everywhere.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.470
- What did you eat, buddy?

13:39.514 --> 13:40.863
- Today?
I had some oatmeal.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.386
- Here's what's gonna happen.

13:42.430 --> 13:45.085
I'm gonna lie you down,
I'm gonna take your pants off,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.695
and I'm gonna wipe
your little tushy.

13:46.738 --> 13:47.870
- What is going on?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.176
- I actually have
the same question.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.743
Hold on one second.
Jake?

13:51.787 --> 13:53.658
- Why did I send Kevin
an obscene picture?

13:53.702 --> 13:54.834
- Relax.
It's not a big deal.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.139
You were just flirting.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.315
- No, if I were flirting,
I would have sent him

13:58.359 --> 14:00.970
a scatter plot
of educational attainment

14:01.014 --> 14:03.364
versus caloric intake
in Jacobin France.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.976
This is as if I've sent him
a bar graph.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.369
- Are bar graphs bad?

14:08.412 --> 14:10.850
- It reduces robust data sets
to a single point.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.155
Get your head out of your ass!

14:12.199 --> 14:14.897
I'm sorry--I'm just panicking,

14:14.941 --> 14:16.768
thinking about what Kevin
will do when he sees it.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.074
- Wait, you don't think
he's seen it yet?

14:18.118 --> 14:19.989
- No, Kevin
only checks his email

14:20.033 --> 14:21.469
once a day at exactly 4:00 p.m.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.775
- You didn't text it to him?
- We're not teens.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.386
- Let's delete it
off his computer, then.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.648
- Yes, that could work.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.911
Kevin has virtual office hours
at 2:00 p.m.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.174
<i>At the same time, Cheddar
will be taking a French lesson</i>

14:31.218 --> 14:33.002
<i>with his tutor,
Monsieur Arnaud.</i>

14:33.046 --> 14:35.091
<i>We only have
one hourexactement.</i>

14:35.135 --> 14:37.224
Here is Kevin's laptop.
- Great.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.965
- "Dear Kevin, attached please
find a picture of my penis.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.619
Sincerely, Raymond Holt."
Deleted.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.884
- Cheddar! <i>
Non, s'il vous plait, non.</i>

14:44.927 --> 14:46.363
French class
must have ended early.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.712
- Shut up.
- Shh.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.411

from One Police Plaza.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.437
They said they were trying
to reach you all morning.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.917
- Mac broke my phone.
What do they want?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.440
- They moved
your presentation up.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.833
You're on in 20 minutes!

16:04.876 --> 16:06.313
- 20 minutes?
- Amy!

16:06.356 --> 16:08.489
We know where Franzia is.
We're gonna go arrest him.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.969
I need you to take Mac.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.796
- No, you need to take Mac!
I have to go right now.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
- So do I!
What do we do?

16:13.450 --> 16:15.017
- I guess we could call
that creepy babysitter

16:15.061 --> 16:17.977
you liked so much.
- The babysitter is Franzia!

16:18.020 --> 16:19.804
- Even better!
Two birds with one stone!

16:19.848 --> 16:21.197
We bring him to you!

16:21.241 --> 16:22.938
- We're not giving our baby

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
- Oh, grow up!
- Come on!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.988
- Amy, if we miss
this presentation,

16:29.031 --> 16:30.685
that's the end
of the pilot program!

16:30.728 --> 16:32.252
- Jake, SWAT is on their way.
We have to go to Franzia's now.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.471
- This is our best chance
at police reform!

16:34.515 --> 16:38.040
- Franzia, Lieutenant, Franzia!
- Reform, Boyle, Reform!

16:38.084 --> 16:39.476
- Okay, enough!

16:39.520 --> 16:42.610
Charles is right.
Jake has waited years for this.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.394
- No, he can make the arrest
without me.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.092
Without you,
there is no presentation.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.181
I'll take Mac.

16:48.224 --> 16:51.923
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.056
All right, now go.
Everyone, get out of here.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.275
Come on.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.799
- I love you.
- Love you.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.024
- Oh, crap, there's Austin.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.764
- Oh, damn, he is a "hud."

17:06.808 --> 17:09.115
- Okay, okay.
Let's just be cool.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.465
- Yeah.
- Here, hold my glasses.

17:11.508 --> 17:14.120
Hey, Austin, long time no--
mm, see.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.947
- Santiago, are you okay?

17:15.991 --> 17:19.212
- Yeah, great.
You look good.

17:19.255 --> 17:22.693
- Thanks, I know, and you have
a very brave hairstyle?

17:22.737 --> 17:23.955
- Thank you.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.784
- Sergeant Santiago,
we're ready for you.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.048
- I look insane.
What am I gonna do?

17:29.091 --> 17:31.963
- Okay, style over substance
is clearly out,

17:32.007 --> 17:34.401
but if anyone can substance
the crap out of this,

17:34.444 --> 17:36.011
it's Amy Santiago.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.493
- You're right, I can do this.
Substance over style.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.234
Mm!

17:41.277 --> 17:43.627
Come on, Amy.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.934
-
- Hello?

17:45.977 --> 17:47.936
Raymond, what are you
doing here?

17:47.979 --> 17:49.198
- Kevin, I didn't know
you were home.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.808
I came by to get a book.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.985
"
Volume Three, 1123 to 1137."

17:54.029 --> 17:56.336
- Why did you need it?
- I had an urgent question.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.989
- About what?
- The atabeg of Mosul.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.339
- Jikirmish?
- Zengi.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.818
- But you already know
everything about Zengi.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.647
- True, it was
Diaz's question, um...

18:03.691 --> 18:05.649
and I was embarrassed for her.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.435
- And what was
your question, Diaz?

18:08.478 --> 18:10.654
- I wanted to know
who Zengi is.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.091
- Yes, that is embarrassing.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.441
I can see why you tried
to cover for her.

18:14.484 --> 18:15.703
Well, if that's all...

18:15.746 --> 18:19.272
- It is.
Uh, just Zengi.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.709
- Just Zengi.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.581
All right, then.
Goodbye.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.761
- How'd it go?
- Good!

18:30.805 --> 18:33.155
They liked the thesis,
and I was clear on the data.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.375
Just one problem--
I realized halfway through

18:35.418 --> 18:36.854
that these sweatpants

18:36.898 --> 18:38.247
are from a bachelorette party
I went to,

18:38.291 --> 18:40.684
and they say WAP
on the butt.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.165
I told them it stands
for "We All Police."

18:43.209 --> 18:46.516
- Hey, wish me luck in there.
- Did your teeth get whiter?

18:46.560 --> 18:47.517
- That's an illusion.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.953
My smile is so symmetrical,

18:48.997 --> 18:50.520
it makes my teeth
seem brighter.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.740
- Well, good luck.
Oops.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.220
- What the hell?

18:54.263 --> 18:56.309
- Austin, we're--

18:56.352 --> 18:57.875
Everything okay?

18:57.919 --> 19:01.662
- He peed himself.
- No.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.490
- That's funny--
same thing happened

19:03.533 --> 19:05.796
to Alex Nelson
at Little Mister Michigan.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.537
What?

19:07.581 --> 19:09.713
Tiny Terry
did what he had to do.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.280
- So right as we get there,

19:11.324 --> 19:13.848
Franzia disappears into these
crazy underground tunnels.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.589
So we have to switch over
to night vision--

19:15.632 --> 19:17.678
- Charles,
it's all so awesome,

19:17.721 --> 19:20.202
but I actually have to stop you
because I got to go.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.074
I have to feed this baby
some mushed-up avocado--

19:23.118 --> 19:25.512
Oh, my God.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.122
- What happened?
Is Mac okay?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.212
-
He just pulled himself up.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.044
- Hey, did Kevin seem weird
to you when we told him

19:36.087 --> 19:37.437
we were only there
for that book?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.221
- You think he didn't
believe us?

19:39.265 --> 19:40.701
- No, he seemed sad.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.224
I think he was disappointed

19:42.268 --> 19:43.921
that you were there
for the book and not for him.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.576
Maybe you should let him know
you've been missing him.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.928
- Huh, well,
it might be worth a shot.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.322
- What did you just do?
- I texted him a picture

19:53.366 --> 19:54.541
of my penis,
like you suggested.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.151
- No. Ugh!

19:56.195 --> 19:57.544
I meant for you to call him

19:57.587 --> 19:59.415
and tell him
you've been thinking about him.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.331
- Why didn't you say that?
- I thought it was understood.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.898
- Hold on.
He's writing back.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.553
- Well, what did he say?
- It's a link to a graph.

20:06.596 --> 20:09.164
It's a scatter plot

20:09.208 --> 20:11.688
with a very robust data set.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.255
Well...

20:13.299 --> 20:14.996
That escalated quickly.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.040
- Hey.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.390
- Hey, how'd
the presentation go?

20:17.433 --> 20:20.262
- Well,
they just called, and...

20:20.306 --> 20:22.177
I won.
- What?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.787
- I have authorization
to start immediately.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.963
- Wait, you won?
That's amazing.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.444
Why aren't you more excited?
Why aren't you dork-dancing?

20:28.488 --> 20:29.793
- 'Cause you had
to miss your thing,

20:29.837 --> 20:31.230
and I didn't want to rub it in.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.275
So I celebrated in the hallway
before I walked in.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.842
Yes! Yeah!

20:34.885 --> 20:36.365
Oh! Oh!

20:36.409 --> 20:37.366
How'd it go here with Mac?

20:37.410 --> 20:39.150
- Fine.
Mellow.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.239
He pulled himself up.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.544
- Wait, what?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.285
That's huge!
He's in the window!

20:43.329 --> 20:45.461
Why are you downplaying this?

20:45.505 --> 20:46.810
- Well, I just figured

20:46.854 --> 20:48.247
you would be bummed
that you missed it.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.683
- Ugh, this sucks.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.162
You didn't get
to arrest Franzia.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.513
I didn't get
to see Mac pull up.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.079
I guess we really
can't do it all.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.255
- I don't know.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.779
I mean, you got to do
the work thing,

20:58.822 --> 21:00.433
and I got to do
the parent thing.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.130
So...

21:02.173 --> 21:04.088
together...

21:04.132 --> 21:05.916
we did do it all.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.179
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.051
<i>♪</i>

21:10.094 --> 21:13.750
It still totally sucks, though.
- Yeah, I'm really bummed.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.491
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.232
- Okay.
You're gonna wake up Mac

21:17.276 --> 21:18.929
and see if he'll pull up,
aren't you?

21:18.973 --> 21:20.888
- Obviously, he is not sleeping
until he does it again.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.324
- All right, well, don't go
without me,

21:22.368 --> 21:23.717
'cause I want to see it.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.111
<i>- Not a doctor.
- Shh.</i>
