WEBVTT

00:06.825 --> 00:08.967
I don't understand why
Glenn needs the shots

00:09.002 --> 00:10.736
if you're the one carrying the baby.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.738
If I have to pump
myself full of hormones

00:12.772 --> 00:14.206
in order to carry his child,

00:14.240 --> 00:16.408
it's only fair that he go
through the same pain.

00:16.442 --> 00:17.876
Yeah, but with saline, so that

00:17.911 --> 00:20.546
my male parts don't
turn into female parts.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.714
Yeah, that's how it works.

00:22.749 --> 00:24.883
I just can't believe you
guys are making a baby.

00:24.918 --> 00:26.518
You don't even like each other.

00:26.553 --> 00:28.487
If I wanted to avoid doing
things with people I hate,

00:28.521 --> 00:29.988
I would literally never leave my house.

00:30.023 --> 00:32.223
And believe me, I am only
doing it for the money.

00:32.258 --> 00:36.662
And believe me, if there was
any other usable, affordable

00:36.696 --> 00:38.397
womb within 1,000 miles of here,

00:38.431 --> 00:39.763
I would not be using hers.

00:39.764 --> 00:41.733
It just sucks that you have
to get so many shots.

00:41.768 --> 00:43.835
Well, I had the option
of taking them orally.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.270
Then why did you pick shots?

00:46.306 --> 00:46.975
That's why.

00:48.770 --> 00:51.942
Synced and corrected by hawken45

00:52.779 --> 00:54.580
Amy, you're old, right?

00:54.614 --> 00:55.847
Um...

00:55.882 --> 00:57.683
Like you were alive during the '90s.

00:57.717 --> 01:00.919
Yeah, I was. Yep, the roaring '90s.

01:00.954 --> 01:03.789
So, what would you say
would be the best piÃ±ata

01:03.823 --> 01:06.692
for a Green Day-themed birthday
party for a two-year-old?

01:06.726 --> 01:08.026
Um, okay.

01:08.061 --> 01:10.295
Let's back that up real quick.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.863
Harmonica's into Green Day?

01:11.898 --> 01:14.132
I doubt she's ever heard of them.

01:14.167 --> 01:14.866
She's two.

01:14.901 --> 01:16.868
But it's my mom's favorite band,

01:16.903 --> 01:19.371
and it's just easier
not to argue with her.

01:19.405 --> 01:20.806
Wouldn't your mom be okay

01:20.840 --> 01:21.907
with something a little
more kid-friendly?

01:21.941 --> 01:24.042
Like, I don't know, "Minions?"

01:24.077 --> 01:27.246
She just got out of jail.
Minions are criminals.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.382
That could suck her right
back in to the lifestyle.

01:30.416 --> 01:32.284
Good point. Um...

01:32.318 --> 01:35.320
All right, well, what
about, like, mermaids?

01:35.355 --> 01:37.864
I don't know. My mom
really wants Green Day.

01:38.491 --> 01:40.559
Mermaids are a lot like Green Day.

01:40.593 --> 01:42.494
They're half-fish, half-human,

01:42.528 --> 01:43.895
they're like rebels.

01:43.930 --> 01:45.664
You know, down for whatever.

01:45.698 --> 01:48.634
In fact, they used to call Green Day

01:48.668 --> 01:50.969
the mermaids of '90s rock.

01:51.004 --> 01:52.671
- Is that true?
- Mm-hmm.

01:52.705 --> 01:53.673
It's totally true.

01:54.274 --> 01:57.109
Jonah, which puzzle seems
more fun for the cabin?

01:57.143 --> 01:59.898
"Bubbling Mountain Brook,"
or "Ankylosaurs?"

02:00.688 --> 02:03.290
Let's go "Bubbling Brook."

02:03.300 --> 02:05.702
Ooh, bad boy. I like it.

02:05.885 --> 02:07.753
Okay, I'm gonna go
hide it so nobody else

02:07.787 --> 02:08.753
buys it before we can.

02:08.788 --> 02:10.322
Ooh, good idea.

02:10.356 --> 02:12.700
Pretty steamy weekend
you guys got planned.

02:12.701 --> 02:14.459
Yeah, I'm excited.

02:14.494 --> 02:15.827
Not as excited as I am.

02:15.828 --> 02:18.363
I got the apartment to myself,
Randy's gonna come over,

02:18.398 --> 02:20.165
we're gonna strap into
our video game chairs

02:20.199 --> 02:22.263
and not move for 70 hours straight.

02:22.264 --> 02:23.419
Oh, um...

02:24.304 --> 02:25.437
Randy's coming over.

02:25.939 --> 02:26.795
Cool.

02:26.796 --> 02:29.541
You're gonna be having sex on
a jigsaw puzzle in the Ozarks,

02:29.575 --> 02:30.542
and you're jealous of Randy?

02:30.576 --> 02:32.177
No, no, jealous? No.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.946
I just didn't know he
was gonna come over,

02:34.981 --> 02:37.640
so that's just, you know,
news to me, is all.

02:40.253 --> 02:40.929
Cool.

02:41.721 --> 02:47.373
20,000, for the most beautiful gift...

02:47.467 --> 02:49.161
Okay, I ran out of space again.

02:49.195 --> 02:51.396
I'm just gonna void this,
and I'll do another one.

02:51.431 --> 02:52.740
It doesn't have to be perfect.

02:52.741 --> 02:55.591
No, I am not starting out
this journey with a mistake.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.376
Here, you can fill out the forms

02:57.377 --> 02:59.338
while I write another one.

02:59.372 --> 03:00.806
Forms?

03:00.840 --> 03:03.041
"Gestational surrogacy agreement."

03:03.076 --> 03:04.876
You're making me sign a contract?

03:04.911 --> 03:07.145
It's what they say
you're supposed to do.

03:07.180 --> 03:09.247
"Regular checkups," "custody release..."

03:09.282 --> 03:11.316
Okay, wait, you think
I want to steal your kid?

03:11.351 --> 03:13.151
And then what?
Have to spend years explaining

03:13.186 --> 03:15.153
why it's good thing to be
chosen last for dodgeball?

03:15.188 --> 03:17.255
No, it's just better safe than sorry.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.625
No, no, no, that's fine, that's fine.

03:18.626 --> 03:20.158
You know what?
I am gonna give this a read,

03:20.193 --> 03:21.893
and I'll let you know
if I have any thoughts.

03:21.928 --> 03:24.909
It should be fine.
It was the first one on Google.

03:25.598 --> 03:27.199
Oh, look how cute!

03:27.233 --> 03:28.900
Mermaid treasure for the treasure hunt.

03:28.935 --> 03:30.335
The treasure is seashells?

03:30.370 --> 03:31.837
Wouldn't mermaid treasure be something

03:31.871 --> 03:33.238
they don't have general access to?

03:33.272 --> 03:36.174
Like, human garbage would
be treasure to them.

03:36.209 --> 03:38.649
I wish I were a mermaid.
I would clean up.

03:38.656 --> 03:39.982
I think you'd be a mer-man.

03:39.983 --> 03:42.669
Yeah, I don't really
buy mermen as a thing.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.153
Then how did they use to, you know...

03:45.563 --> 03:46.958
[bleep]?

03:47.263 --> 03:49.998
Unless that's why they went extinct.

03:50.033 --> 03:51.800
They didn't go extinct.

03:51.835 --> 03:54.236
They lost their tails over
the course of centuries

03:54.270 --> 03:55.370
and turned into humans.

03:55.405 --> 03:56.278
It's called evolution.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.805
I don't think so.

03:57.806 --> 03:59.736
Okay, fine, God made us.

03:59.737 --> 04:01.135
Look at the human eye.

04:02.011 --> 04:03.078
It's too complicated.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.047
No, I believe in evolution.

04:05.081 --> 04:07.850
I'm just saying it's make
believe... it's like unicorns.

04:07.884 --> 04:09.852
We don't know that
there were never unicorns.

04:09.886 --> 04:13.488
I read that we discover like 50
new species of frogs each year.

04:13.523 --> 04:15.591
Maybe scientists just haven't
discovered unicorns yet.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.159
Frogs are tiny. I think somebody

04:17.192 --> 04:18.468
would've noticed a unicorn.

04:18.469 --> 04:20.204
A lot of people believe unicorns exist.

04:20.206 --> 04:22.164
A lot of people believe in Bigfoot.

04:22.198 --> 04:23.498
A lot of people believe in angels!

04:23.533 --> 04:25.000
I believe in angels.

04:25.034 --> 04:26.668
No, you don't.

04:26.703 --> 04:27.541
Yeah, I do.

04:27.924 --> 04:29.825
I used to think kangaroos were real.

04:45.288 --> 04:46.688
I'm gonna have to have
my clothes converted

04:46.723 --> 04:48.857

Hey, I was happy to have

04:55.832 --> 04:58.934
You're the one who wanted
to get all formal about it.

04:58.968 --> 05:01.703
I'm gonna have to take some
time to review these changes.

05:01.738 --> 05:05.807
Sure, oh, FYI, clauses 30-49
are all vag-related,

05:05.842 --> 05:08.371
and the last page is the before photos.

05:17.687 --> 05:20.958
Whoa, Oreo really upped its
game while I was in prison.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.677
It's like a fat kid's fever dream.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.797
Oh, Amy, this is my mom.

05:27.130 --> 05:28.497
Oh, my gosh! Hi!

05:28.531 --> 05:29.898
You're the famous Amy.

05:29.933 --> 05:31.166
I've heard so much about
you over the years,

05:31.200 --> 05:32.301
I feel like I know you.

05:32.302 --> 05:35.264
I'm so sorry about the divorce
and how your life is going.

05:36.339 --> 05:38.473
Oh, um, thank you.

05:38.508 --> 05:40.976
Uh, so what brings you to the store?

05:41.010 --> 05:44.471
Oh, she was just bringing me
this shirt that she got me

05:44.781 --> 05:46.770
that I forgot to put on this morning.

05:46.771 --> 05:48.055
It's more professional.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.592
And I gotta get some
stuff for the party.

05:49.593 --> 05:52.254
Do you have a Green
Day-themed bouncy house?

05:52.288 --> 05:54.638
Green Day? What happened with mermaids?

05:54.639 --> 05:57.092
My mom thought we should
go back to Green Day.

05:57.126 --> 05:59.985
Mermaids is a little
juvenile, don't you think?

06:00.630 --> 06:03.665
Well, I mean, it is a
two-year-old's birthday party,

06:03.700 --> 06:05.500
and Chey really liked the idea...

06:05.535 --> 06:06.682
Amy, I don't mean to be rude,

06:06.683 --> 06:08.537
I know you've been kind
of a mother figure

06:08.571 --> 06:10.827
for Cheyenne while
I've been away, but...

06:11.507 --> 06:12.816
I'm her actual mother,

06:13.142 --> 06:16.594
so don't you have some
shelving to do or something?

06:18.205 --> 06:19.671
Yes, sure.

06:20.683 --> 06:21.650
Yeah, sorry.

06:21.684 --> 06:22.918
- Okay.
- Bye.

06:22.919 --> 06:23.675
Bye.

06:24.988 --> 06:26.523
Cinnamon bun Oreos?

06:28.861 --> 06:29.928
Technology.

06:35.150 --> 06:36.582
"I'm her actual mother."

06:36.617 --> 06:37.583
with its miserable excuse
What does that even mean?

06:37.618 --> 06:39.051
Hard to say.

06:39.086 --> 06:41.554
It either means she's the one
who gave birth to her,

06:41.588 --> 06:42.216
or...

06:42.756 --> 06:44.979
that's the only thing that it means.

06:44.980 --> 06:47.379
Well, it doesn't give her
the right to just swoop in,

06:47.379 --> 06:49.180
and start changing up
perfectly good shirts,

06:49.214 --> 06:50.624
and perfectly good parties.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.984
I mean, mermaids is a better
theme than Green Day.

06:54.019 --> 06:55.886
Like, that's an objective fact, right?

06:55.921 --> 06:57.388
- I like Green Day.
- Really?

06:57.422 --> 06:59.156
Name three of their songs.

06:59.191 --> 07:00.825
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"
"Good Riddance,"

07:00.859 --> 07:02.093
"When I Come Around."

07:02.094 --> 07:04.095
Okay, well, those are the
obvious ones... name three more.

07:04.129 --> 07:06.363
"Basket Case," "Longview,"
"American Idiot."

07:06.398 --> 07:08.032
You are a very irritating person.

07:08.066 --> 07:09.667
I just don't think
that you should butt in.

07:09.701 --> 07:12.169
You... you butt in all the time.

07:12.204 --> 07:14.029
That's why your butt is so big.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.332
"Welcome to Paradise."

07:18.076 --> 07:20.401
"Wake Me Up When September Ends."

07:21.747 --> 07:23.057
I love Green Day.

07:24.149 --> 07:26.517
I've never really hired a lawyer before.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.726
But I just wanted to
make sure everything

07:28.754 --> 07:30.421
Dina put in was kosher.

07:30.455 --> 07:32.080
Yeah, well, that makes sense.

07:33.759 --> 07:35.526
I'm sorry about using the word "kosher."

07:35.560 --> 07:37.497
That wasn't a comment on your religion.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.435
Oh, I'm not Jewish.

07:40.458 --> 07:41.433
Okay.

07:42.167 --> 07:43.675
I don't mind, though.

07:45.103 --> 07:47.071
Well, is it basically okay?

07:47.105 --> 07:49.907
Yeah, mostly there's just
a couple small, little nitpicky

07:49.941 --> 07:51.709
things that might be
worth discussing with Dina.

07:51.743 --> 07:54.645
Oh, okay. I could go get her right now.

07:54.679 --> 07:55.720
Yeah.

07:55.721 --> 07:57.381
I'll bring in a bagel and a smear.

07:57.415 --> 07:58.897
Again, I am not, uh...

07:59.918 --> 08:02.086
You know what?
An onion bagel would be great.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.195
Onion bagel.

08:08.693 --> 08:10.795
Do you think Green Day is a mistake?

08:10.829 --> 08:16.000
Well, you know, I-I don't
want to butt in, or...

08:16.034 --> 08:19.503
But yes, I do, it's crazy.
Cuckoo bananas, makes no sense.

08:19.538 --> 08:20.938
You think mermaids would be better?

08:20.972 --> 08:23.240
Yes, 100%, I think
you should do mermaids.

08:23.275 --> 08:24.451
Look, Chey,

08:24.843 --> 08:27.244
you don't have to do everything
your mom tells you to do

08:27.279 --> 08:28.612
just because she's your mom.

08:28.647 --> 08:31.315
I just... I have a hard time
standing up to her.

08:31.349 --> 08:33.082
She never listens to what I want.

08:33.118 --> 08:36.320
Well, you just gotta sit
her down, and tell her,

08:36.354 --> 08:39.332
"I am a grownup.
I make my own decisions."

08:40.225 --> 08:42.827
You want me to brag about you to my mom?

08:42.861 --> 08:43.828
Uh-uh.

08:43.861 --> 08:44.967
Sorry.

08:44.968 --> 08:47.364
You would say you were a grownup,

08:47.399 --> 08:49.133
you make your own decisions.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.830
She knows she's a grownup.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.138
Why don't we go talk to her together?

08:54.172 --> 08:55.229
Okay.

08:55.507 --> 08:57.308
- Okay.
- All right, yeah.

08:57.342 --> 08:59.443
I was reading about our Airbnb,

08:59.477 --> 09:01.612
and it said that the
toilet is sensitive,

09:01.646 --> 09:03.655
so maybe don't flush your baby wipes.

09:03.656 --> 09:05.349
Yeah, of course, totally.

09:05.383 --> 09:08.118
Um, hey, earlier, uh, when
you were talking about

09:08.153 --> 09:09.787
how you believed in angels,

09:09.821 --> 09:12.990
you meant, sort of, like
a general, ineffable

09:13.024 --> 09:14.725
sense of spiritual presence, right?

09:14.759 --> 09:18.253
Not... not like magical little
creatures flying around?

09:18.697 --> 09:20.164
What, you mean like fairies?

09:21.066 --> 09:21.732
Yeah, I mean, I...

09:21.766 --> 09:24.335
- Oh, no, no, I'm not a child.
- Okay, all right, okay.

09:24.369 --> 09:25.836
Okay, I was just... I was just checking.

09:25.871 --> 09:26.837
Yeah.

09:28.340 --> 09:31.642
Yeah, no, by angels,
I meant like regular-sized,

09:31.676 --> 09:34.044
celestial beings who look out for us.

09:34.715 --> 09:35.496
Right.

09:36.047 --> 09:41.085
Right, yeah, but not... not with,
like, with halos and wings.

09:41.119 --> 09:43.920
No, they have halos and
wings, they're angels.

09:44.789 --> 09:45.512
Right.

09:46.391 --> 09:48.859
Okay, cool, yeah, no, I was just, um...

09:48.894 --> 09:50.895
I was just checking, so.

09:50.929 --> 09:53.497
Are they goat? Are they dog?
I don't know what they are.

09:53.531 --> 09:56.030
- Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys!
- Shh! Shh!

09:56.031 --> 09:57.935
Two chupacabra sightings,

09:57.969 --> 10:00.070
two remote Mexican villages,

10:00.105 --> 10:02.273
same exact description.

10:02.307 --> 10:04.108
And you know those people
don't have the Internet.

10:04.142 --> 10:05.342
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, I'm sold.

10:05.377 --> 10:06.710
I'm putting it in real.

10:06.745 --> 10:08.212
You know what should be in mythical?

10:08.246 --> 10:10.014
A man who knows where the G-spot is.

10:10.048 --> 10:11.081
Justine,

10:11.116 --> 10:12.549
contribute, or leave.

10:12.584 --> 10:14.701
It's the third time
you've made that joke.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.521
Oh, so now, we're
lawyering up, is that it?

10:17.555 --> 10:20.155
No, no, no, no. Bruce is a friend.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.492
He's here to help us.

10:21.493 --> 10:23.394
It's more like we're "friending" up.

10:23.428 --> 10:24.895
I'm not here to make
anything contentious.

10:24.930 --> 10:26.263
I just want to make sure

10:26.298 --> 10:27.464
there's no misunderstandings
down the road.

10:27.499 --> 10:29.466
See? He's a nice guy.

10:29.501 --> 10:30.935
So, as I understand it,

10:30.969 --> 10:33.304
you both mutually agreed
to this surrogacy, so...

10:33.338 --> 10:35.205
- Mm-hmm.
- If you were to fail to honor

10:35.240 --> 10:36.473
your agreement, we would be forced

10:36.508 --> 10:38.475
to go after you with extreme prejudice.

10:38.510 --> 10:40.077
Wait...

10:40.111 --> 10:41.478
Go after me?

10:41.513 --> 10:43.147
I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't being clear.

10:43.181 --> 10:46.083
Um, we would sue you for
every penny that you're worth.

10:46.117 --> 10:48.085
We would own you, 'cause you
mess with Glenn Sturgis,

10:48.119 --> 10:49.653
you get the horns!

10:49.688 --> 10:51.755
Okay, this is not... this is
not what we talked about.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.457
So you either sign this contract,

10:53.491 --> 10:55.225
or we're gonna bury you
under so much paperwork

10:55.260 --> 10:56.593
you're gonna need a machete

10:56.628 --> 10:58.495
to get from your bedroom
to your bathroom!

10:58.530 --> 11:00.297
Well, the joke's on you,
because I keep a machete

11:00.332 --> 11:01.999
in every room in my house.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.667
Okay, we're losing the magic

11:03.702 --> 11:05.502
of the journey that
we're going on together.

11:05.537 --> 11:07.771
Sign the contract, Ms. Fox. You sign it!

11:07.806 --> 11:09.139
You want to come after me, Glenn?

11:09.174 --> 11:10.674
- No.
- Well, bring it on.

11:10.709 --> 11:12.276
And as for you, I have a cousin
at the Bar Association,

11:12.310 --> 11:15.746
so you better pray to God your
CLE credits are up to date.

11:17.148 --> 11:19.316
Well, I think that was
a nice opening bid.

11:19.351 --> 11:21.169
Oh, is this whitefish?

11:22.487 --> 11:24.088
Do you believe in angels?

11:24.122 --> 11:26.623
Uh, which answer leads
to no follow-up questions?

11:26.658 --> 11:27.825
Kelly believes in 'em.

11:27.859 --> 11:29.626
Like believes believes, you know?

11:29.661 --> 11:32.496
It's like wings and halos and harps.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.932
Well, I didn't ask about
harps, but I assume...

11:34.966 --> 11:36.600
So she believes in angels. Who cares?

11:36.634 --> 11:38.769
I don't care, no, I just...

11:38.803 --> 11:40.137
I just think it's interesting, you know,

11:40.171 --> 11:42.373
I mean, I don't believe in angels,

11:42.407 --> 11:44.475
but if she wants to believe in angels,

11:44.509 --> 11:46.977
then I respect that, you know?

11:47.012 --> 11:48.345
Doesn't bother me.

11:48.380 --> 11:52.816
Is that something
you think would bother you?

11:52.851 --> 11:54.852
Maybe, I don't know.
Hey, when do you guys leave?

11:54.886 --> 11:56.620
Because I'm about to
order a 22-foot sub,

11:56.654 --> 11:57.988
and I'd prefer to keep it intact,

11:58.023 --> 12:00.324
so one end has to start in your room.

12:00.358 --> 12:02.993
So there are a couple issues.

12:03.028 --> 12:04.770
Wow, that's complex.

12:05.196 --> 12:07.031
That is [bleep] complex.

12:07.065 --> 12:09.833
Um, your daughter is trying
to have a conversation

12:09.868 --> 12:11.535
with you, so if you could
put the cookie down,

12:11.569 --> 12:13.727
and try to engage meaningfully...

12:14.672 --> 12:17.141
I'm so sorry, I was just
recently in couple's therapy,

12:17.175 --> 12:18.600
and that just popped out.

12:20.078 --> 12:22.880
All right, I'm engaging meaningfully.

12:23.948 --> 12:26.395
I don't want to do a Green Day party.

12:26.718 --> 12:28.252
I thought I asked you to
mind your own business.

12:28.286 --> 12:30.242
This is all Cheyenne,
I'm just here for support.

12:30.243 --> 12:32.423
But she agrees with me, okay?

12:32.457 --> 12:33.757
Green Day is dumb.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.693
And you know what?
I'm not going to college.

12:36.728 --> 12:38.929
What? Huh?
No, we didn't talk about that.

12:38.963 --> 12:40.164
Cheyenne, you're going to college.

12:40.198 --> 12:40.958
No, I'm not.

12:41.243 --> 12:42.699
Just 'cause you're my
mom doesn't mean that

12:42.734 --> 12:44.101
you get to tell me what to do.

12:44.135 --> 12:45.119
Right, Amy?

12:45.120 --> 12:49.039
Um, I mean, in general,
that seems true...

12:49.074 --> 12:50.340
See? She agrees.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.876
I'm an adult, and I
make my own decisions.

12:52.911 --> 12:55.546
And so, I'm gonna buy a motorcycle,

12:55.580 --> 12:58.115
or, I don't know, a monkey, maybe both.

12:58.149 --> 13:00.717
Um, could we just quickly
go back to the college thing...

13:00.752 --> 13:02.286
You don't get to tell
me what to eat, either!

13:02.320 --> 13:03.854
So if I want to eat peyote,

13:03.888 --> 13:05.789
I am gonna eat all the peyote I want.

13:05.824 --> 13:08.192
And I'm getting a full-sized back tattoo

13:08.226 --> 13:10.727
of the raccoon from
"Guardians of the Galaxy,"

13:10.762 --> 13:13.664
okay? 'Cause I love that movie, and...

13:24.901 --> 13:27.302
So you're saying reindeers
actually exist,

13:27.337 --> 13:28.904
like, in the real world?

13:28.938 --> 13:31.373
We had a reindeer in the
store on Christmas.

13:31.407 --> 13:33.308
I didn't think it was a real reindeer.

13:33.343 --> 13:34.576
I thought it was a normal deer

13:34.610 --> 13:36.712
with antlers nailed to its head.

13:36.746 --> 13:39.981
Oh, I don't think leprechauns
should be in the real column.

13:40.016 --> 13:41.316
Who knows, though, right?

13:41.351 --> 13:42.818
- What?
- What are you doing?

13:42.852 --> 13:44.486
Is this still about the angel thing?

13:44.520 --> 13:46.555
- Hm?
- Look, I get it.

13:46.589 --> 13:48.623
I mean, it must be hard
to believe in angels

13:48.658 --> 13:50.325
if you've never seen one first-hand.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.095
Wait, you've seen an angel?

13:53.129 --> 13:54.679
- Sure have.
- When?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.965
Shh! When?

13:56.999 --> 13:59.634
Well, um, when I was five,

13:59.669 --> 14:01.603
I fell into the indoor pool

14:01.637 --> 14:03.171
at the Silver Dollar City Ramada Inn.

14:03.206 --> 14:04.339
And I mean,

14:04.374 --> 14:06.241
I sank like a brick.

14:06.275 --> 14:09.845
And I remember thinking I'd
never seen my parents again.

14:09.879 --> 14:12.914
When suddenly, this figure appeared.

14:12.949 --> 14:14.282
Did he have wings?

14:14.317 --> 14:15.350
He did have wings.

14:15.385 --> 14:16.752
Knew it. I knew it.

14:16.786 --> 14:19.354
And he sort of was like
floating above me,

14:19.389 --> 14:22.625
as if to say, "You're safe now."

14:23.059 --> 14:25.994
Next thing I know, I'm
back in our hotel room,

14:26.028 --> 14:27.302
dry as a bone.

14:27.830 --> 14:28.864
Oh!

14:28.898 --> 14:30.165
Wow.

14:30.199 --> 14:32.501
That's real.

14:32.535 --> 14:36.304
Is it possible that
the figure was floating

14:36.339 --> 14:39.040
because he was, you know, in a pool?

14:39.075 --> 14:40.709
I know what I saw.

14:40.743 --> 14:44.212
Yeah, and I believe that
you believe that you saw that,

14:44.247 --> 14:48.283
but you were also deprived of
oxygen for a little while...

14:48.317 --> 14:49.500
Why are you doing this?

14:49.501 --> 14:51.853
Because he's jelly
of your peanut butter.

14:51.888 --> 14:55.056
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not... I'm not jelly, no.

14:55.091 --> 14:58.193
I just... I just think, you know,
maybe what you saw

14:58.227 --> 14:59.740
wasn't, um, an angel.

14:59.741 --> 15:04.618
Maybe what you saw was just
a pasty hotel guest in a robe.

15:05.268 --> 15:06.285
Yeah, maybe.

15:06.669 --> 15:08.370
Mm-hmm. Maybe I'll consider that

15:08.404 --> 15:10.405
when I'm home this weekend, alone.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.934
Whoa, whoa, what are
we talking about, now?

15:13.543 --> 15:15.710
Trouble in paradise.

15:15.745 --> 15:17.546
Have you been in the break room all day?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.581
Yeah, I'm just not feeling it today.

15:19.615 --> 15:22.050
Look, I'm sorry, I did not know that

15:22.084 --> 15:23.385
she was gonna say those things.

15:23.419 --> 15:25.320
All I said to her was that
she should be able

15:25.354 --> 15:27.489
to make her own decisions.
But I am not her mom.

15:27.523 --> 15:30.258
And if someone told my
daughter not to listen to me,

15:30.293 --> 15:32.194
well, then, I would be pretty upset.

15:32.228 --> 15:34.262
So, I am sorry.

15:34.297 --> 15:35.530
I just get so worried

15:35.565 --> 15:37.065
she's gonna make
the same mistakes I did.

15:37.099 --> 15:38.667
- Yeah.
- I get so scared

15:38.701 --> 15:40.101
she's gonna end up in jail,

15:40.136 --> 15:43.205
or still working here
when she's our age.

15:43.239 --> 15:44.673
Uh, yeah, I don't...

15:44.707 --> 15:47.108
I don't know that those two
are exactly equivalent.

15:47.143 --> 15:48.376
I don't know which is worse.

15:48.411 --> 15:50.278
Jail, probably.

15:50.313 --> 15:51.422
Well...

15:53.316 --> 15:55.147
Hey, what do you think about Bo?

15:55.585 --> 16:00.288
Uh, I think he is an
interesting individual.

16:00.323 --> 16:01.289
I think he's a loser.

16:01.324 --> 16:03.358
Clown. I mean, "clown"

16:03.392 --> 16:05.427
is the first word that comes to mind.

16:05.461 --> 16:06.795
When I think of him, like,

16:06.829 --> 16:09.564
I half expect my hand to
buzz when he shakes it.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.933
I don't think clowns do that any more,

16:11.968 --> 16:13.201
but that's very funny.

16:13.236 --> 16:14.238
You're funny.

16:16.515 --> 16:17.200
Hey.

16:18.674 --> 16:20.942
Dina, I know things
got a little heated...

16:20.977 --> 16:23.271
Listen, I apologize if I overreacted.

16:23.679 --> 16:25.981
Oh, thank God. Me too.

16:26.015 --> 16:27.883
The things is, I'm gonna go have sex

16:27.917 --> 16:28.984
- with Marcus in a few minutes.
- What?

16:28.985 --> 16:30.886
What?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.988
That's the special project
you needed help with?

16:33.786 --> 16:34.422
Sweet!

16:34.457 --> 16:36.224
- Why would you...
- There's just an attraction

16:36.259 --> 16:37.425
there, I can't deny it,

16:37.460 --> 16:38.581
blah, blah, blah, the point is,

16:38.582 --> 16:40.295
maybe I get pregnant, maybe I don't.

16:40.329 --> 16:41.237
Who knows?

16:41.238 --> 16:42.733
So this could be all booked up.

16:42.734 --> 16:43.990
No room at the inn.

16:43.991 --> 16:44.756
You can't do this.

16:44.757 --> 16:48.670
Oh, I am going to with zero protection.

16:48.704 --> 16:49.886
Zero?

16:50.706 --> 16:51.973
Amy and I think you need

16:52.008 --> 16:54.009
to start getting serious
about your life.

16:54.043 --> 16:55.744
So now you're on her side?

16:55.778 --> 16:57.979
No, I'm not on anyone's side.

16:58.014 --> 17:00.348
I just agree with her on this stuff.

17:00.383 --> 17:05.119
So, now I think it's time for
you to engage meaningfully.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.989
You gotta be responsible,
and part of being responsible

17:08.023 --> 17:09.124
means getting rid of Bo.

17:09.157 --> 17:10.162
Wait, what?

17:10.163 --> 17:11.792
He's a loser, Amy and I both agree.

17:11.827 --> 17:12.761
You do?

17:12.795 --> 17:15.530
No, uh-uh, I did never call him a loser.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.198
Sorry, I think I'm the one
who called him a loser.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.640
Amy called him a clown.

17:18.641 --> 17:20.669
I don't... I don't know
how this is productive.

17:20.703 --> 17:21.703
How about we get back to the college...

17:21.737 --> 17:23.278
I can't believe you guys.

17:23.973 --> 17:26.940
Amy and I are on the same
page about this one.

17:27.910 --> 17:29.644
I felt like that went so well.

17:29.679 --> 17:31.531
She is so attached to Bo.

17:32.315 --> 17:34.950
Yeah, they are married.

17:38.434 --> 17:39.685
The same rules as last time?

17:39.686 --> 17:42.291
No kissimg, no eye contact, I
leave as soon as you're done?

17:42.337 --> 17:43.670
We're not sleeping together.

17:43.705 --> 17:45.806
That was just a negotiation
tactic with Glenn.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.275
Oh, right.

17:48.797 --> 17:50.611
Of course. Smart.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.571
I mean, if someone actually cared,

17:52.606 --> 17:55.174
it could be super
hurtful, but it's not me.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.043
Dina, I'd like you to
meet my new surrogate.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.209
She's ready to rock.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.442
Isn't that right, Sandra?

18:00.443 --> 18:02.485
Yeah, I'm really excited.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.539
And I have no problem
signing all the paperwork,

18:05.540 --> 18:07.319
so let's do it.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.426
Sandra, mm-hmm.
You're gonna go with Sandra?

18:09.427 --> 18:10.157
Mm-hmm.

18:10.158 --> 18:12.381
You are gonna leave your baby
at the mercy of a person

18:12.382 --> 18:15.861
whose judgment is so bad
she moved from Hawaii

18:15.896 --> 18:16.837
to St. Louis?

18:16.838 --> 18:18.564
Yes, I am.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.956
And as soon as I give Sandra the shot,

18:21.222 --> 18:23.197
our deal is over.

18:23.198 --> 18:24.289
Fine, good.

18:24.527 --> 18:25.580
Marcus!

18:27.140 --> 18:28.495
That was just foreplay, all right?

18:28.502 --> 18:29.945
We're about to get this thing going!

18:29.946 --> 18:31.911
Sandra, lift your shirt.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.546
Marcus, take off your shirt!

18:33.580 --> 18:35.714
Fair warning, I still have
a bit of a Thanksgiving paunch

18:35.749 --> 18:37.883
I'm working off.
All right, this is happening.

18:37.918 --> 18:40.452
Oh, oh, oh, well, you know
what else is happening?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.021
This thing over here!
Yeah, look at this!

18:42.055 --> 18:43.289
Here we go!

18:43.323 --> 18:45.691
- Take this off!
- Come on, go, go, go!

18:45.725 --> 18:47.560
Guys, guys, guys!

18:47.594 --> 18:50.462
You both know what you're
doing, so stop pretending!

18:50.497 --> 18:53.265
Glenn, you obviously
don't want to use Sandra.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.234
Of course I don't want to use Sandra.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.017
Who would want to use Sandra?

18:57.018 --> 18:58.625
You think I want to
have sex with Marcus?

18:58.626 --> 19:00.272
He starts every time by saying,

19:00.307 --> 19:01.772
"I'm not really sure what
I'm doing down there."

19:01.773 --> 19:03.520
Oh, sorry for being honest.

19:03.521 --> 19:06.398
Well, both of you clearly
want this, so just get over it.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.716
Fine with me.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.379
All right.

19:15.989 --> 19:16.788
So...

19:19.292 --> 19:21.240
I guess we should go back to work.

19:21.241 --> 19:23.495
Are you hitting on me?

19:23.530 --> 19:25.313
I honestly... I can't tell anymore.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.758
Hey.

19:28.021 --> 19:29.966
Hey, join us.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.438
So you two are getting along.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.773
Yeah, we worked it all out.

19:34.808 --> 19:36.065
Good, good.

19:36.066 --> 19:38.471
See? All it needed was a little
bit of communication...

19:38.472 --> 19:42.147
Amy, we're gonna need you
to engage meaningfully

19:42.182 --> 19:43.148
for a minute.

19:43.183 --> 19:43.982
I'm sorry, what?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.853
Shh! You're not engaging.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.320
Look, I love you, but sometimes,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.623
you give a little bit too much advice.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.292
Like, telling me how to spend my money,

19:53.326 --> 19:55.160
or that my yearbook quote shouldn't be,

19:55.195 --> 19:56.955
"Catch me outside, how 'bout that?"

19:56.956 --> 19:59.331
Yeah, I was just saying that
yearbooks are permanent.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.033
You're pushy, you're manipulative,

20:01.067 --> 20:02.768
and you were super mean about Bo.

20:02.802 --> 20:06.005
Ooh, are you burning Amy?
I got a good one.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.155
Your hair. Boom.

20:09.592 --> 20:10.637
That was harsh.

20:11.065 --> 20:13.370
I don't know, man,
I mean, today it's angels,

20:13.371 --> 20:15.781
tomorrow it's, let's go ghost hunting.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.950
Look, man, Kelly is cool, she's fun,

20:17.992 --> 20:19.115
you guys should go away together.

20:19.116 --> 20:22.210
Yeah, well, maybe we will.
Just not this weekend.

20:23.056 --> 20:23.892
No.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.396
You have something special,

20:26.397 --> 20:27.566
and you're gonna throw it all away

20:27.567 --> 20:29.561
'cause she sees an angel or two?

20:29.596 --> 20:30.693
Are you just saying this because

20:30.694 --> 20:32.414
you don't want to miss out on
your epic gaming weekend

20:32.415 --> 20:34.055
- with Randy?
- Screw the weekend!

20:34.056 --> 20:36.702
This is about you and an amazing woman

20:36.736 --> 20:38.024
that I don't want to see slip away.

20:38.025 --> 20:40.539
Okay, you can drop
the cheesy Rom-Com routine.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.166
Jonah, the world is a lonely place.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.798
Now, when two people find love,
they need to celebrate...

20:45.799 --> 20:47.313
Ironically, the content of everything

20:47.347 --> 20:48.399
you're saying is true,

20:48.400 --> 20:51.183
but you don't need to...
to dress it up in some...

20:51.217 --> 20:52.851
You have a real shot at happiness,

20:52.886 --> 20:54.353
you dumb son of a bitch.

20:54.387 --> 20:57.189
If you don't take it,
I'll never forgive you.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.549
But more importantly,

20:59.292 --> 21:00.909
you'll never forgive you.

21:02.650 --> 21:04.518
Okay, I'll go talk to Kelly.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.031
You take that shot, man.

21:06.066 --> 21:08.200
You go to her, and you never look back!

21:08.234 --> 21:12.037
I'm going to, but not because
of this thing, okay?

21:12.072 --> 21:13.285
You get her back.

21:15.575 --> 21:19.545
Sorry about that, dawg.
Yes, we are back on.
