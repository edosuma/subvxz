00:31.782 --> 00:34.866
<i>Is this the end you wanted?</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:43.162
It is the end that I deserve!

01:15.284 --> 01:20.746
<i>According to legend, the sword
of the morning star knight...</i>

01:21.582 --> 01:25.622
<i>... forged on the second
full moon in December,...</i>

01:27.879 --> 01:31.873
<i>... the year he was born.</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:37.675
<i>The 5,000 blows it had to endure
gave the sword its power.</i>

01:40.142 --> 01:43.010
<i>A triumph of fire,...</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:48.056
<i>... a baptism in the water.</i>

01:52.029 --> 01:58.321
<i>It was a weapon of unprecedented
purity and strength.</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:04.789
<i>A sword worthy of a king!</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:13.753
<i>But first it had to find its master!</i>

02:14.760 --> 02:24.759
IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA -
FIGHTERS, SINNERS, SAINTS

02:30.609 --> 02:33.727
CASTLE OF LOYOLA 1496

02:39.910 --> 02:41.867
Ignatius!

02:42.746 --> 02:44.703
Stay here.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.515
Don Beltram, for a word?

03:13.193 --> 03:16.061
I would have gladly given this
to you for a happier occasion.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.189
It was forged to honor
your fallen heroes.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.321
You could not have wished
for a better son than Juan.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.365
Thank you my Lord,...

03:25.372 --> 03:27.705
... that you helped me during
these difficult hours.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.455
Little Ignatius is ready to return
to his family in Torre de Loyola.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.377
As soon as you wish!

03:34.881 --> 03:38.090
Let's talk about it another time.
Thank you, old friend.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.563
- Where is he going?
- Maria!

03:53.191 --> 03:55.399
Give it a moment.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.688
After all this time, may
he still not return?

03:59.990 --> 04:02.198
One day Don Beltram will realize...

04:02.409 --> 04:04.822
... that the boy is not to blame
for the death of his mother.

04:05.328 --> 04:10.198
<i>Until then, let him grieve
for his beloved wife,...</i>

04:11.752 --> 04:14.995
<i>... and now also
his firstborn son.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:54.041
Shall we again, my lord knight?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.536
For the moment we are done.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.084
Well.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.731
I need you again next week.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.568
If you are still here then...

05:23.406 --> 05:25.022
What do you know?

05:26.159 --> 05:29.573
We women know everything, Capitan!

05:38.880 --> 05:41.122
Twice this week, cousin?

05:41.550 --> 05:44.384
Are you really going to
lecture me, you bastard?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.632
I just want to say
that you need variety!

05:46.847 --> 05:50.215
She is good, but not so good!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.184
She reminds me of someone.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.935
Is there any news from Castile, Xanti?

05:59.651 --> 06:02.940
Apparently, our young king is
learning how to be a king.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.689
Last week he executed
three rebels.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.525
Now the Comuneros arise.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.907
And the queen?

06:14.082 --> 06:19.168
She and the princess are still
in the hands of the rebels.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.339
Enemies! All over!

06:28.471 --> 06:33.091
And we're stuck with a
commander who lets us drill.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.685
The South rebels, the
North is unprotected,...

06:36.980 --> 06:38.937
... and the damn
French know that!

06:40.025 --> 06:42.483
It is only a matter of time
before they attack us.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.271
Soon we will know more.
Tomorrow our spy returns from Biarno.

06:48.074 --> 06:53.194
What do you think? Do we have 3,000 men
at the door at the end of the week?

06:53.455 --> 06:55.822
You almost look forward
to meeting them.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.495
We are soldiers, not guards!

06:59.085 --> 07:02.954
For three years, we throw
drunkards in the dungeon.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.040
We are destined for higher!

07:07.886 --> 07:12.005
And, to prove that,
do you accept death?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.432
How do you wish your death?

07:17.479 --> 07:20.938
Peaceful!
I want to die in my sleep.

07:21.316 --> 07:25.026
In the arms of my beautiful wife.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.853
If I ever find one...

07:29.449 --> 07:32.408
What about you?
How do you want to die?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.617
In the battle!

07:37.499 --> 07:39.286
Before I take my last breath,...

07:39.918 --> 07:42.205
... I want to look my
brother in the eye and say:

07:42.379 --> 07:45.838
"Do you see?
I too am a Loyola! "

07:47.133 --> 07:49.967
Martin never lets you
have the last word.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.510
No way!

07:51.721 --> 07:54.054
Ignatius, you worry too much.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.384
Drink more, think less!

08:01.189 --> 08:04.808
<i>Above all, a knight needs three things:</i>

08:05.902 --> 08:07.438
<i>A god he can serve...</i>

08:07.696 --> 08:09.187
<i>... a king he can obey...</i>

08:09.656 --> 08:12.615
<i>... and a lady he can
protect most of all damage.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:14.237
CASTLE OF VALLADOLID 1518

08:14.244 --> 08:18.579
<i>At all times, day and
night, he must be ready!</i>

08:42.813 --> 08:44.476
Assassin, you may be good,...

08:46.943 --> 08:48.559
... but I am better!

08:56.411 --> 08:57.947
Did not you tell?

08:59.039 --> 09:04.080
Whoever threatens my lady,
Princess Catalina, has died!

09:04.627 --> 09:06.243
Who threatens me?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.715
Who are you talking to?

09:13.094 --> 09:15.757
Nobody is here, Your Highness!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.176
I only practiced.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.973
I'm sorry!

09:20.185 --> 09:22.472
Did I disturb your highness sleep?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.105
No, I could not sleep,...

09:26.107 --> 09:28.224
... so I wanted to go to the library.

09:29.611 --> 09:34.106
Unfortunately, the library had
to give way to the new aviary.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.616
This is a pity.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.412
So it's up to you to
entertain me, sir...?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.577
Ignatius de Loyola, Your Highness.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.412
I am not a master.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.833
I am only a submissive soldier
of the Duke of Najera.

09:50.173 --> 09:54.463
I'm afraid I'm not a very good
entertainer, Your Highness.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.755
Ignatius, it's the middle of the night.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.681
Nobody is here that you can impress
with your protocol loyalty!

10:02.060 --> 10:04.677
Please, call me Catalina.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.180
Well, mistress Catalina.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.485
I heard you talking to someone.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.574
Pure imagination.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.957
I learned this technique
from my father.

10:27.544 --> 10:31.834
You imagine your enemy
in flesh and blood.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.420
Apparently, your father
was a capable swordsman.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.295
Do you really use such elegant
movements in a battle?

10:39.764 --> 10:42.427
They have often proved useful, Your Highness.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.844
Almost like a dance.

10:46.771 --> 10:51.141
Half of my sword art, I
learned while dancing.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.941
You are a dancer?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.862
I was a servant in Arevalo.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.106
That was part of our education.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.951
Perfect! Now I know how
you can entertain me.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.746
Come on! Impresses me,...

11:07.125 --> 11:08.616
... Ignatius de Loyola!

12:27.121 --> 12:28.703
Forgive me, Your Highness.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.371
I was not too!

12:30.375 --> 12:31.866
I forbid you to think so!

12:32.335 --> 12:34.201
Yes, mistress, but...

12:34.671 --> 12:36.663
... I have to insist.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.419
I know.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.803
Kneel down, Loyola!

12:58.903 --> 13:00.690
Nobody will ever know this.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.946
Nobody will remember.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.070
Only you and me.

13:05.868 --> 13:09.532
Tonight, I make
you my knight,...

13:09.998 --> 13:11.489
... to my secret protector.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.708
Swear to me to protect
my life and my honor...

13:15.086 --> 13:16.622
... as long as you live!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.499
I swear that!

13:24.262 --> 13:26.470
This is my last night at this castle.

13:28.391 --> 13:31.008
At dawn I return to the
court of the Queen.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.728
Should we never meet again...

13:34.939 --> 13:37.647
... promise me that you will keep
me in good memory, my knight.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.184
Serve my kingdom well!

13:41.237 --> 13:43.103
I would die for you!

13:43.656 --> 13:45.943
For my sake, do not do that!

14:13.019 --> 14:14.226
The commander was right.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.851
You dress for the victory celebration
before the battle is won.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.808
He misunderstands that.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.310
I dress for the coffin.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.694
Good morning, Commander.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.989
Montes, you are early!

14:35.458 --> 14:38.417
My nights are calmer than yours.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.997
Enough!

14:41.089 --> 14:42.421
Drive away.

14:43.466 --> 14:49.303
As expected, the French commander
Lord Asparros arrived here.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.632
So far, he has met little resistance.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.134
The people from Navarre support him.

14:55.812 --> 15:01.774
Asparros wants to drive us out and put the
old King of Navarre back on the throne.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.442
How many?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.194
12,000, maybe more.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.777
That's amazing!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.903
He will not stop Navarra.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.653
With such a force, he
will march in Castile.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.281
With such a force, we
have to let him go!

15:17.667 --> 15:18.748
Sir!

15:18.918 --> 15:20.955
The order is to keep
Pamplona at all costs.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.916
Ignatius, be sensible!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.793
We have barely 300 men!

15:26.008 --> 15:27.715
Pamplona is lost, Loyola.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.342
The city may be lost,...

15:29.345 --> 15:31.587
... but the fortress will last!

15:32.265 --> 15:34.052
We have 18 guns.

15:34.434 --> 15:38.303
We can focus the fire
on their artillery.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.184
And on the cavalry!
We shoot at the horses!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.518
That slows her down.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.525
The French can not go to
Castile without conquering us.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.192
- Maybe we can stop her for two
or three days? - Three days?

15:49.449 --> 15:53.409
You want to sacrifice the lives of
your men? For three days deferment?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.322
Commander,...

15:56.330 --> 15:57.616
... with all due respect!

15:57.999 --> 16:02.118
How many kings lost their crown because
the reinforcement came a day late?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.579
We are at war.

16:06.215 --> 16:09.424
Maybe the fate of the
empire depends on it...

16:09.427 --> 16:11.589
... that we buy some time for Castile.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.758
Every time we can!

16:14.849 --> 16:17.683
I say, we hold the position.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.059
I say we fight!

16:21.022 --> 16:26.734
We die, then knowing that the
French have sensed Spanish blades!

16:27.612 --> 16:29.820
We owe that to our king.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.533
You are early!

16:39.957 --> 16:42.916
- Our troops?
- The enemy!

16:43.920 --> 16:45.661
In the morning they are at the gates.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.670
Your orders, sir?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.499
Close the gates!

16:51.135 --> 16:53.252
Tell the men to
go to confession.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.297
Tomorrow we meet our destiny.

17:01.771 --> 17:11.770
<i>Latin blessing</i>

17:13.074 --> 17:16.407
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.943
Amen.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.492
Lots to do, father?

17:21.707 --> 17:24.575
Everyone is looking for God
when he is about to meet him.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.917
Do you want to confess?

17:27.255 --> 17:30.339
By the time we finish,
the war is over, father.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.544
Get rid of all ammo!

17:35.846 --> 17:37.303
Do not hold back!

17:37.557 --> 17:39.264
Keep the powder dry!

17:39.433 --> 17:41.265
You have signed our death sentence!

17:41.477 --> 17:43.935
We already have, when
we went to the army!

17:44.689 --> 17:46.646
Do not pretend that
you are one of us!

17:46.899 --> 17:50.313
When Navarra falls, your noble
blood allows you safe passage.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.604
With these men, the French
will not be so kind.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.023
Look at it!

17:56.367 --> 17:57.858
Look!

17:58.869 --> 18:02.112
Are their eyes saying that
they are thinking of glory?

18:02.665 --> 18:05.829
No! They do it for the money.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.951
And because they want to go home.

18:08.254 --> 18:12.123
Then we should teach them to
fight for something bigger.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.091
That's the problem with you!

18:15.386 --> 18:18.129
You already see yourself as a general.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.222
You are ready to
sacrifice your troops.

18:20.558 --> 18:24.051
But they need a leader who
wants to save their lives!

18:32.903 --> 18:36.692
<i>This is the story of the last
battle of the brave knight.</i>

18:37.617 --> 18:38.733
Sir!

18:38.993 --> 18:40.359
Take this to Loyola.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.413
Are the soldiers ready?

18:48.878 --> 18:50.085
Well.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.462
Your right and your left.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.128
To the weapons!

19:25.331 --> 19:27.414
Wait!

19:29.794 --> 19:31.831
Guns!

19:37.468 --> 19:40.051
Fire!

19:45.059 --> 19:47.142
<i>The battle was short.</i>

19:49.271 --> 19:53.481
<i>How long can an acorn last, against
the blows of a sledgehammer?</i>

20:36.736 --> 20:38.648
Into the breach!

20:39.155 --> 20:42.023
Beat the bastards back!

21:39.799 --> 21:42.007
For the glory!

22:32.268 --> 22:35.761
No! No! Ignatius, wake up!

22:36.105 --> 22:37.562
Ignatius?

22:38.732 --> 22:41.850
Ignatius, open your eyes, you bastard!

22:42.444 --> 22:45.733
<i>Latin blessing</i>

22:46.031 --> 22:49.445
No! No! He does not die!

22:50.035 --> 22:51.321
Do you hear me, you fool?

22:51.328 --> 22:53.445
Do you hear?
You stay with us!

22:54.081 --> 22:56.744
I go to my brothers.

22:57.167 --> 23:01.127
- For the glory. - Your brothers
are underground, you stay here!

23:01.422 --> 23:05.416
Now shut up and let the
healer do his job!

23:16.395 --> 23:22.312
<i>As he lay dying, the knight's
heart thanked the sky...</i>

23:22.693 --> 23:26.778
<i>... for this last gift.</i>

23:29.867 --> 23:32.610
<i>The death of a warrior.</i>

23:33.829 --> 23:36.037
<i>Stand up!</i>

23:51.055 --> 23:53.172
Stand up!

23:57.227 --> 24:00.971
- The first rule?
- To breathe!

24:01.357 --> 24:04.976
Is your enemy angry,
but you are calm?

24:05.319 --> 24:07.982
Then you have already won!

24:13.035 --> 24:16.449
Hey! Zwischen H H H H H H H H zwischen zwischen H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H?

24:17.081 --> 24:19.323
Watch your feet! No!

24:19.583 --> 24:22.451
Never take your eyes
off your opponent.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.501
Balance, Ignatius!
Balance!

24:27.841 --> 24:31.209
A battle is always about
staying on your feet.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.216
Once again!

24:39.269 --> 24:40.976
Do it better!

24:46.068 --> 24:48.185
What did I tell you?

24:54.493 --> 24:57.861
Remember, son!
We are men from Loyola.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.242
We never lower our eyes.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.952
Stand up!

25:08.340 --> 25:10.457
- Where am I?
- At home!

25:10.801 --> 25:14.761
- Sofia! Julen!
- Take care of his leg.

25:29.695 --> 25:33.405
My professional opinion?
Maybe his leg will never heal completely.

25:34.158 --> 25:37.196
<i>We have to break it and judge it.</i>

25:39.496 --> 25:42.455
We do what we can, but
then it's in God's hands.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.664
If his condition does not
improve after three days,...

25:47.963 --> 25:51.798
... he will probably die.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.172
The rebels have capitulated and
Castile's troops are on their way.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.014
Maybe three more days!

26:00.434 --> 26:02.972
<i>Once they are here,
we move to Pamplona.</i>

26:03.312 --> 26:04.894
You must?

26:05.105 --> 26:06.812
We do that for Ignatius.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.103
If he survives, let him know...

26:09.109 --> 26:11.066
... that we crushed
the damn French!

26:11.737 --> 26:13.694
If not,...

26:14.948 --> 26:17.861
... at least we avenged his death.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.012
Where am I?

26:44.353 --> 26:45.434
You are at home...

26:45.771 --> 26:47.012
... and alive.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.310
God be praised!

26:51.819 --> 26:53.481
Drink that.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.284
That's disgusting!

27:06.542 --> 27:08.909
Be glad that you are still
alive and can complain!

27:09.294 --> 27:11.911
The doctors did not have much hope.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.332
I dreamed about him.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.544
He told me that I would live.

27:19.972 --> 27:24.057
And on his feast day.
You have a guardian angel!

27:25.686 --> 27:27.393
How does it look like?

27:27.729 --> 27:30.267
The doctors are sure that
you will walk again.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.391
Someday.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.394
Nobody survives a
bombardment without scars.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.451
What's this?!

27:44.663 --> 27:46.871
Not without scars...

27:48.250 --> 27:51.368
Be glad that you came home in better
condition than your brother Juan.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.328
Perhaps.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.705
But he came back as a hero!

27:56.300 --> 27:57.916
As a dead hero.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.631
Drink your tonic.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.561
Say, why are you wearing this uniform?

28:17.821 --> 28:21.485
As a Castilian soldier, you can
not protect me with this leg.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.910
You are useless. Get out of
my sight, damned cripple!

28:35.964 --> 28:38.172
I've always known it!

28:39.593 --> 28:41.880
You are not worthy of this sword!

28:42.971 --> 28:44.758
And our name!

28:53.732 --> 28:55.473
Are you alright, Ignatius?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.813
Get me a surgeon!

28:58.237 --> 28:59.773
Immediately!

29:03.825 --> 29:05.737
Certainly?

29:14.503 --> 29:16.039
Hold him tight!

29:38.026 --> 29:41.690
Doctors say you can go
outside in two months.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.529
Until then, I'm trapped in this tower.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.448
Yes, it will be hard...

29:46.660 --> 29:49.653
... but somehow you
have to pass the time.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.244
Your servant has got you this.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.623
They might interest you too.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.670
You found the books?

30:04.052 --> 30:06.795
- 'The Adventures of Amadís'?
- No I'm sorry.

30:07.597 --> 30:11.466
Julen was with every nobleman,
from here to Donostia.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.676
He could not find it.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.805
These are the only
books in the house.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.398
'The life of Christ'?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.276
'The Lives of the Saints'?

30:23.947 --> 30:26.439
Hermana, brother Pedro alone
would interest those!

30:26.825 --> 30:28.657
He is the priest, not me!

30:29.161 --> 30:31.778
I found that in the
bag of your uniform.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.868
I wanted to save it.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.838
- It was washed.
- That had to be.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.165
It was full of your blood!

31:12.454 --> 31:16.494
Slowly, my lord!
Right foot, left foot.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.160
Well! Sit down!

31:27.094 --> 31:28.960
<i>Don Martin!</i>

31:32.557 --> 31:34.423
<i>Don Martin!</i>

31:34.851 --> 31:36.717
Sir, they are back!

31:47.614 --> 31:49.776
- Long live Loyola!
- It lives!

31:54.454 --> 31:56.787
Come on!

31:56.957 --> 31:59.415
- Yuri!
- Here!

32:00.377 --> 32:01.743
The wine to me!

32:02.003 --> 32:04.746
- A really good wine, right?
- Yes.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.293
Now fill in, go!

32:07.843 --> 32:09.926
- I'll be right back!
- Gonzalo!

32:11.888 --> 32:13.254
- Xanti.
- Ignatius!

32:13.640 --> 32:16.633
Brothers! There you are!

32:17.185 --> 32:18.596
Good news!

32:18.812 --> 32:20.394
We were victorious in the end!

32:20.814 --> 32:23.272
We drove the French
bastards across the border!

32:23.442 --> 32:25.058
All for you!

32:25.360 --> 32:28.649
And Asparros has lost an eye!

32:29.114 --> 32:30.980
I say, that was your hit, Martin.

32:31.158 --> 32:37.371
It only matters that Pamplona and
Navarre are once again Castile!

32:38.790 --> 32:42.033
The queen and princess
are finally safe.

32:42.502 --> 32:44.334
As you wanted it.

32:44.588 --> 32:45.829
Is not it, cousin?

32:46.131 --> 32:47.838
We made it.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.458
Congratulations!

32:50.927 --> 32:53.840
- Victory is ours!
- Exactly!

32:54.097 --> 32:55.884
Victory is ours!

32:56.475 --> 32:59.263
? H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H zwischen?
- Castile!

33:11.907 --> 33:13.364
Are you all right?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.914
That should have been my battle!

33:27.255 --> 33:28.996
My victory!

33:31.009 --> 33:32.466
They were in the majority, Ignatius.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.669
Then it should have
been my glorious death!

33:34.930 --> 33:37.764
They should have let
me die on the wall.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.972
Maybe you would be proud
of me then, right?

33:42.145 --> 33:45.058
Ignatius, do not say that!

33:45.607 --> 33:47.940
Of course we are proud of you.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.658
I keep asking myself:

34:00.038 --> 34:05.329
Why was I born to
such boring times?

34:06.586 --> 34:09.043
Everything has already been done.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.295
You can no longer search,...

34:14.302 --> 34:16.339
... do not kill dragons anymore.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.838
There are no more virgins in need.

34:19.724 --> 34:24.185
What remains are senseless
family quarrels.

34:25.772 --> 34:30.141
Three noble cousins bickering
over a piece of Spanish filth.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.022
The world is changing, Ignatius.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.574
Maybe it's time to
dream a new dream?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.121
THE END

34:55.927 --> 34:59.637
<i>Three months ago, the knight
was wounded in battle.</i>

35:00.974 --> 35:02.931
<i>And one thing is clear:</i>

35:03.602 --> 35:09.894
<i>Nothing bothers the soul more than
the partnership of pain and boredom.</i>

35:12.402 --> 35:15.440
<i>Of course he dreamed of her!</i>

35:16.948 --> 35:18.359
<i>His lady.</i>

35:18.617 --> 35:20.609
<i>His sweet Catalina!</i>

35:20.952 --> 35:23.490
<i>What would he give
to be with her?</i> !

35:23.872 --> 35:26.785
<i>To serve her, to die for her!</i>

35:29.794 --> 35:34.084
<i>But at the end of those dreams,
there was always a painful truth.</i>

35:35.759 --> 35:38.502
<i>A life with her was impossible!</i>

35:41.056 --> 35:43.423
<i>Not with this leg!</i>

35:45.310 --> 35:48.053
<i>Not with this destiny!</i>

35:51.232 --> 35:53.599
<i>Did he remember what
he had lost,...</i>

35:53.777 --> 36:00.115
<i>... he sank into agony,
into anguish and despair.</i>

36:28.978 --> 36:31.641
<i>Be like your brother...</i>

36:37.529 --> 36:42.866
<i>The loss of your
brother is your sin...</i>

36:43.076 --> 36:46.240
<i>Shame! Shame! Shame!</i>

36:48.415 --> 36:51.829
<i>You are not worthy
to be a Loyola...</i>

36:56.256 --> 36:58.589
<i>"The life of the saints".</i>

36:59.551 --> 37:04.888
<i>On these pages, the lives of the
saints of God are immortalized.</i>

37:05.890 --> 37:10.100
<i>These knights of
heaven spent great,...</i>

37:10.437 --> 37:12.554
<i>... in the name of the Almighty.</i>

37:13.773 --> 37:15.355
<i>The knights of heaven?</i>

37:17.527 --> 37:22.522
<i>To his surprise, our knight was
fascinated by these stories.</i>

37:22.949 --> 37:26.283
<i>He was amazed at the nobility
and bravery of the saints.</i>

37:26.494 --> 37:27.826
FRANCIS OF ASSISI

37:30.331 --> 37:32.789
<i>It's one thing to prove
courage as a soldier...</i>

37:33.042 --> 37:36.251
<i>... and to face the enemy
with the sword in his hand.</i>

37:37.839 --> 37:39.330
<i>It is a very different thing...</i>

37:39.507 --> 37:42.124
<i>... to face hunger
and humiliation,...</i>

37:42.552 --> 37:47.343
<i>... alone with the belief in
the care of an invisible God.</i>

37:49.851 --> 37:52.969
Francis, how was all this possible for you?

37:54.939 --> 37:57.352
Give up your wealth,...

37:58.234 --> 38:01.068
<i>... to beg for leftovers,...</i>

38:01.946 --> 38:04.689
<i>... of the people who once
called themselves your servants?</i>

38:05.700 --> 38:08.408
My friend, you are asking
the wrong question!

38:08.953 --> 38:10.945
The 'how' is unimportant.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.621
It's about the why!

38:13.249 --> 38:16.367
It is what my Lord has done.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.120
What is the wealth
that I gave up...

38:19.130 --> 38:20.837
... compared to the
riches of the sky?

38:22.175 --> 38:24.542
Your faith is greater than mine.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.628
Not my faith is great,...

38:28.139 --> 38:29.926
... it's my god!

38:32.560 --> 38:34.472
Could not you do the same?

38:38.566 --> 38:40.808
<i>These thoughts were different.</i>

38:41.903 --> 38:44.316
<i>They did not darken his heart.</i>

38:45.907 --> 38:50.242
<i>They dipped him in radiant joy.</i>

38:53.081 --> 38:57.542
<i>Maybe this was his true desire.</i>

38:59.212 --> 39:01.169
<i>Could he do the same?</i>

39:01.506 --> 39:03.748
<i>Could he trust in God,
as they once did...</i>

39:04.843 --> 39:08.837
<i>... and swear allegiance
to the greatest of kings?</i>

39:14.477 --> 39:17.094
<i>That night, he made a decision.</i>

39:19.065 --> 39:23.150
<i>That night, he found his dream.</i>

39:30.368 --> 39:32.655
- What ?!
- a pilgrim.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.241
He wants to go to Jerusalem,...

39:35.540 --> 39:37.281
... and beg there on the way.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.284
Like the holy pilgrims of the old days.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.790
But he is a Loyola!

39:42.589 --> 39:44.080
We can not allow that.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.378
What will people say?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.931
Well, never mind.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.682
We regulate how we have
always regulated things.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.723
Among brothers.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.143
There we are!

40:05.320 --> 40:07.312
Just like in old times.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.063
Somewhat dirtier than before.

40:09.282 --> 40:12.946
What are you talking about? That's perfect!
We are together again!

40:13.286 --> 40:15.243
Mesonero! Mesonero!

40:15.580 --> 40:18.243
- Wine and breasts!
- Immediately, sir.

40:18.541 --> 40:23.787
Carmen, you look very
adorable tonight.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.042
- It was so long ago!
- We missed your pretty faces!

40:29.218 --> 40:30.459
Where were you?

40:31.054 --> 40:33.546
- He was at war.
- Me too!

40:33.765 --> 40:35.222
- Were you hurt?
- Oh yeah!

40:35.433 --> 40:39.643
But nothing that could not
solve a few hip swings.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.308
He needs immediate
medical treatment!

40:45.985 --> 40:48.944
- Anna is an excellent sister.
- Yes!

40:49.155 --> 40:52.614
- We do not waste time.
In the back room with him! - Okay.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.527
- Let's go.
- Off to the back room!

41:02.460 --> 41:03.996
You're welcome! You're welcome!

41:05.129 --> 41:06.836
I do not want that.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.248
Are you alright, sir?

41:11.010 --> 41:16.347
You're welcome! You're welcome!
Just let us sit and be silent.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.010
In order?

41:18.726 --> 41:21.810
We wait for my brothers to finish.
Then we can go.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.563
I'll pay you anyway.

41:26.401 --> 41:27.733
As you wish, sir.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.488
Do you do that for a long time?

41:37.537 --> 41:39.278
Long enough.

41:40.248 --> 41:43.616
If you remember, then you
were my third customer, sir.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.496
Are you treated well here?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.502
Better than at home.
I can not complain.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.337
At home?

41:57.306 --> 42:00.174
My father was a drunk,
my mother a bitch.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.977
They both beat me.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.021
I forgot most of it.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.354
That,... I'm sorry.

42:11.904 --> 42:15.318
- That must have been hard.
- After father's death it got better.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.573
I came here with my bare feet.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.446
Now I have saved some money.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.373
I sew clothes.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.581
- You made this dress?
- Yes.

42:29.630 --> 42:31.917
- It's pretty.
- Thank you.

42:34.343 --> 42:35.959
One day I will go away.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.837
Then I become a seamstress.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.341
That's something... honorable.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.348
This is my dream.

42:46.689 --> 42:47.930
Why not immediately?

42:48.357 --> 42:49.473
Why not immediately?

42:49.776 --> 42:51.108
Yes?

42:51.903 --> 42:54.065
Yes? Why not immediately?

43:12.507 --> 43:15.466
- Are you all right?
- Yes my Lord.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.963
Forgive!

43:18.721 --> 43:20.587
You do not have to apologize.

43:23.643 --> 43:27.057
You are the first in a
long time talking to me...

43:29.190 --> 43:32.354
... and do not want
me to undress...

43:32.819 --> 43:34.902
... and then go again.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.112
I do not know if I can
leave this life behind me.

43:42.745 --> 43:45.988
I look in the mirror,
I only see a whore.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.213
What is your name?

44:06.394 --> 44:07.760
Anna.

44:08.563 --> 44:10.225
Anna?

44:13.776 --> 44:17.986
Did you know that the mother of
the Blessed Virgin was 'Anna'?

44:19.282 --> 44:20.864
I know the stories.

44:21.284 --> 44:25.278
Then you also know that some of
the Lord's friends were whores?

44:35.923 --> 44:37.630
Could you try something for me?

44:38.009 --> 44:39.671
Yes my Lord.

44:41.637 --> 44:46.803
Could you imagine Jesus
sitting there in this chair?

44:49.187 --> 44:51.554
- In the chair there?
- Yes.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.356
Can you imagine that?

44:55.568 --> 44:56.934
Try it!

44:59.447 --> 45:01.154
Take your time!

45:21.135 --> 45:22.922
He looks at me.

45:27.266 --> 45:29.508
And he smiles.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.679
It's a kind smile.

45:36.484 --> 45:39.943
He looks at me like he's
done that all my life.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.240
What does he say to you?

45:53.584 --> 45:55.576
That he understands me.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.125
That...

46:01.259 --> 46:03.421
... he loves me.

46:05.554 --> 46:07.637
That he does not
care where I was.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.927
Only where am I going.

46:19.694 --> 46:21.105
Does not that make you happy?

46:21.404 --> 46:25.273
Yes! Yes!

46:38.254 --> 46:40.462
I am fine!
Everything perfect!

46:42.717 --> 46:46.210
It looks like this evening has
been good for you, brother.

46:50.433 --> 46:52.595
More than you think.

46:58.274 --> 47:01.438
<i>Here in Loyola there is
nothing left to learn.</i>

47:04.238 --> 47:06.571
<i>My life started at this castle.</i>

47:09.410 --> 47:11.322
<i>I almost died here.</i>

47:13.205 --> 47:18.291
<i>It has become clear to me that my
reprieve is subject to a condition:</i>

47:21.339 --> 47:23.672
<i>I have to leave this place.</i>

47:24.800 --> 47:26.257
<i>Forever!</i>

47:34.018 --> 47:36.180
You go back to Najera?

47:51.494 --> 47:53.201
I know what you intend to do.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.787
Then give me your blessing...

47:56.290 --> 47:57.701
... and wish me luck!

47:59.543 --> 48:02.160
You are needed here, Ignatius.

48:05.091 --> 48:07.583
Seriously, brother!

48:09.595 --> 48:11.757
What use do I have here?

48:13.057 --> 48:15.549
I am a damned cripple!

48:16.268 --> 48:19.261
At court I will never be
able to show myself again.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.471
And my soldiers?

48:22.400 --> 48:25.359
They rather follow a blind
donkey into battle,...

48:25.569 --> 48:27.231
... not a limping fool.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.650
Ignatius...

48:32.410 --> 48:37.371
I was ready to give
my life for the king.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.828
I almost had that.

48:42.545 --> 48:45.959
And now, 40 days after
I almost died...

48:47.341 --> 48:50.550
... Pamplona is Castile again,
as if nothing had happened!

48:52.888 --> 48:56.677
All my victims, for what?

48:58.102 --> 49:01.140
Nobody asks you to be a hero.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.722
But we ask you to stay.

49:05.151 --> 49:06.733
Help manage the castle.

49:07.194 --> 49:08.901
Make sure everything
is taken care of.

49:09.071 --> 49:12.530
You want to make a steward out of me?
A secretary?

49:13.159 --> 49:16.527
Brother, that's too much of an honor!

49:18.914 --> 49:20.655
What do you see?

49:24.170 --> 49:25.627
Our coat of arms.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.912
What do you see?

49:28.132 --> 49:30.966
Seven red bars on a
golden background.

49:31.510 --> 49:35.094
And two gray wolves next to a cauldron.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.927
The red bars, as you know,...

49:38.893 --> 49:40.259
... were awarded to us by the king.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.186
In memory of the bravery
of the seven brothers.

49:43.355 --> 49:45.642
Oñaz, your ancestors!

49:46.525 --> 49:51.645
- The wolves and the cauldron...
- Stand for the goodness of the Loyola family.

49:52.406 --> 49:57.572
After the man has eaten, there is even
something left for the wolves. I know!

49:59.663 --> 50:01.871
So we tell people.

50:05.711 --> 50:09.079
Do you know the true meaning?

50:10.341 --> 50:12.048
It is a warning.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.719
It applies to all descendants
of the house Loyola.

50:17.056 --> 50:18.422
Ignatius...

50:19.725 --> 50:21.466
... not all men are noble.

50:21.894 --> 50:26.229
Most serve only the
hand that feeds them.

50:27.191 --> 50:31.606
Without the cauldron, the wolves
would eat us up completely.

50:38.619 --> 50:42.533
Our family needs you.
I know that for sure.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.789
<i>The pilgrim knight.</i>

50:53.175 --> 50:54.632
<i>A new life.</i>

50:55.344 --> 50:57.256
<i>A new search.</i>

51:00.266 --> 51:02.303
<i>I thought I would feel sad,...</i>

51:02.476 --> 51:04.684
<i>... because I leave my old self behind me.</i>

51:05.688 --> 51:09.773
<i>But I only regret not
leaving earlier.</i>

51:12.027 --> 51:13.438
He comes again!

51:14.113 --> 51:15.570
My uncle Antonio was the same.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.656
After being hit by
an arrow in Italy...

51:17.658 --> 51:21.368
... he embarked on a sacred journey
to a mountain in Portugal.

51:21.996 --> 51:25.160
After five days he was
back at our border.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.534
Ignatius has always been a stubborn person.

51:34.008 --> 51:36.751
Hey! He comes again!

51:39.555 --> 51:42.263
Keep an eye on him for me.

51:43.309 --> 51:45.266
It will be worth it for you.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.765
500 Reales,...

51:48.230 --> 51:50.722
... if you bring him back
before the end of the month.

52:44.578 --> 52:48.948
<i>The ancient shrine of the Lady of Montserrat.</i>

53:00.260 --> 53:03.503
<i>A knight swears allegiance to his
master for the first time...</i>

53:03.764 --> 53:06.802
<i>... so he had to keep a watch first.</i>

53:07.226 --> 53:09.809
<i>He stays there for three days.</i>

53:10.521 --> 53:13.104
<i>He writes down his sins.</i>

53:13.524 --> 53:16.733
<i>He looks very closely
at his life.</i>

53:16.902 --> 53:19.315
<i>He seeks even the smallest spot.</i>

53:22.491 --> 53:26.986
<i>Then he swears before his mistress,...</i>

53:27.746 --> 53:29.703
<i>... the queen of the sky.</i>

53:29.915 --> 53:33.955
<i>He swears fidelity to
her, and God the Lord.</i>

53:34.169 --> 53:35.660
<i>Forever!</i>

53:45.723 --> 53:50.468
<i>In the end, he puts on his
new, magnificent armor.</i>

54:11.165 --> 54:13.373
<i>He leaves the darkness,...</i>

54:13.542 --> 54:16.250
<i>... he goes into the
world that needs him.</i>

54:16.920 --> 54:20.379
<i>A warrior, at the
side of the angels.</i>

54:21.091 --> 54:24.459
<i>A knight of the sky!</i>

54:45.324 --> 54:47.065
Do you have bread?

54:48.577 --> 54:51.160
Forgive me, friend.
I do not have anything.

54:51.538 --> 54:54.326
What are you good for?

54:55.876 --> 54:57.663
Wait!

55:01.757 --> 55:03.544
Take this.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.792
- That keeps you warm.
- What's this?

55:05.969 --> 55:08.336
Dress!
Sell them for food!

55:08.555 --> 55:09.762
Whatever you want.

55:10.849 --> 55:12.681
And take this.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.729
I thank you!

56:04.403 --> 56:06.269
Don Ignatius de Loyola?

56:10.200 --> 56:11.407
Perhaps.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.409
You should come with me, sir.

56:16.248 --> 56:17.830
You thief!

56:20.794 --> 56:22.706
Hermano? Hermano?

56:23.839 --> 56:26.582
Water! Get water!

56:29.970 --> 56:32.804
- Water! - He was wearing the
clothes he stole from you.

56:32.806 --> 56:34.172
He did not steal her!

56:34.474 --> 56:36.716
I gave it to him of his own free will!

56:37.936 --> 56:39.393
Who told you that
it is my clothes?

56:40.147 --> 56:41.979
That was me.

56:46.194 --> 56:47.435
Xanti?

56:50.240 --> 56:52.482
You are here to bring
me back to Loyola.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.573
I just wanted to offer you a horse.

57:00.542 --> 57:03.159
You are not used to
walking barefoot.

57:07.007 --> 57:09.090
You already know my answer.

57:11.803 --> 57:13.510
I implore you, Ignatius!

57:15.849 --> 57:17.340
Ignatius, please!

57:18.810 --> 57:22.303
At least take this.
For your journey.

57:39.748 --> 57:41.990
Get him a doctor!

57:44.503 --> 57:46.460
Tell Martin I'm dead.

57:51.510 --> 57:53.342
I implore you!

58:05.565 --> 58:11.232
<i>The pilgrim now stayed on the
back roads and in small towns.</i>

58:12.572 --> 58:16.065
<i>He could not risk his
relatives finding him again.</i>

58:17.703 --> 58:19.695
<i>He had made a oath.</i>

58:19.997 --> 58:22.364
<i>And he would fulfill him!</i>

58:37.472 --> 58:42.763
<i>He wanted to live as Francis of
Assisi and Saint Dominic did.</i>

58:43.770 --> 58:46.183
<i>Without any possessions.</i>

58:47.149 --> 58:49.766
<i>Begging for food.</i>

58:57.743 --> 59:00.156
<i>When he first settled
down to beg,...</i>

59:01.496 --> 59:03.408
<i>... he felt like a scammer.</i>

59:04.291 --> 59:06.078
<i>Like a hypocrite.</i>

59:16.386 --> 59:19.094
Good day.
A gentle gift? Sorry?

59:22.476 --> 59:24.684
A gentle gift? Sorry?

59:27.230 --> 59:29.392
An alms?

59:47.959 --> 59:50.667
Sorry? An alms?

59:51.421 --> 59:52.912
Thank you!

59:56.218 --> 59:58.631
A gift? Thank you!

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:05.267
<i>But when his last money was gone
and his hunger was great,...</i>

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:09.475
<i>... his needs became real.</i>

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.356
<i>It became my true skin.</i>

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.858
<i>The skin of a beggar.</i>

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.321
I caught one of my servants
taking food out of the pantry,...

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.741
... just to give it to you.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.994
Because of what you said to him.

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:16.000
- I apologize!
- No need.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.171
He is the most unpleasant of all servants to me.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.958
It was good that he did
something selfless.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.878
Even if it was a small theft.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.888
Do you always do that?

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:28.883
Beg all day,...

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.643
... to distribute the food
at night to the patients?

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.975
I can not help it.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.102
The patients are helpless.

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.901
I can beg for her outside,
so I'm begging for her.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.863
I am Doña Ines de Pascual.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.400
What is your name?

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.902
Ignatius.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.245
Ignatius?

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.494
Like the first king of Pamplona?

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:57.169
I would say I am the
cripple of Pamplona.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.503
My mistress!

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:02.341
Very well, Mr. Ignatius,
Cripple of Pamplona.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.971
You are not the first soldier who
wants to change his life here.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.720
And not the first nobleman.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.717
Do not deny it!

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.888
Blue blood I smell a
mile against the wind.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.182
But I recognize that you are
doing something special.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.775
And the way you do it.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.030
No matter how long you live
this life of poverty,...

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:27.866
... want to live begging,
hunger and good deeds,...

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:30.786
... you are always welcome at my table.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:35.534
All my means are at your disposal!

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:42.415
You are a gift of
God, Doña Ines.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.088
I know!

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.718
Wait! I'll help you!

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:54.260
<i>Slowly my life in Manresa
got its own rhythm.</i>

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:57.892
Take!

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:03.771
<i>During the day we supplied
the poor with bread.</i>

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:10.234
<i>Sometimes we took care of the
lonely patients in the hospital.</i>

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.155
<i>The work was tiring.</i>

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.203
<i>But we held on.</i>

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:34.968
<i>At night I retreated to
a cave on the Cardoner.</i>

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:38.896
<i>There I paid my debt to Christ.</i>

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:43.810
<i>Let's say it like this:
God took his time with me...</i>

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.690
<i>... like a child.</i>

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:47.813
<i>You are not blind.</i>

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:58.583
<i>You will soon hear the
grace of my son again.</i>

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:24.809
<i>Nearly 10 months after I
arrived in Manresa,...</i>

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:30.152
<i>... I left the cave as a new man!</i>

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:38.949
<i>So God had prepared me
for what was to come.</i>

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:56.132
<i>In the name of His
Holiness, the Pope,...</i>

01:04:56.434 --> 01:05:01.020
... this court of the Holy
Inquisition formally came together.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:05.441
<i>It is directed by Ignatius
Lopez de Oñaz y Loyola.</i>

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:12.316
Once a soldier of the king, he was
charged with the following points:

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:18.821
<i>Preaching, without permission.</i>

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:24.915
Dealing with and seducing
women from Salamanca.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:29.749
<i>Secret and occult meetings,
in the middle of the night.</i>

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:33.131
If the defendant is found guilty,...

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.305
... he will die in the fire at the end of the month.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:39.391
Before, the case is checked.

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:52.734
<i>Is all this my fault?</i>

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:56.029
<i>Should I have kept silent?</i>

01:05:57.579 --> 01:06:00.242
<i>How are the new brothers, Calixto?</i>

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:02.865
Caceres works hard.

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:03.912
FIVE DAYS PREVIOUSLY

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.626
Arteaga is too silent.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.250
Too silent to be one of us.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.666
I do not think he can
last much longer.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:15.253
Arteaga follows brother Ignatius's rule:

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:20.095
Listen more, talk less.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.052
I think he misses
his 50 servants.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.391
And the fine clothes
that do not scratch.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:29.684
I admit it!
Today I lack my clothes!

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.286
Take you, brother.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.998
When you pray, what
are you asking?

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.374
The usual.

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:49.996
A long life and wealth
for me and my family.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.963
Why are you asking for it?

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.882
Because that's good.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.678
May one ask nothing good from God?

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:03.100
Consider, great wealth brought
many fear and misfortune.

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:06.353
Their lives are determined by wealth.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:10.065
And even a long life
can be painful.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:11.688
Yes but...

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.027
... what should we pray for then?

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.861
Maybe for indifference?

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:21.452
I do not mean heart cold.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.619
It does not matter if God gives
you wealth or poverty...

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.912
... good or bad health.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:31.332
As long as poverty, wealth
and life length help you...

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.505
... to fulfill your mission.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.917
Brother, what mission are you talking about?

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:44.183
When you got up today, what
were your plans for the day?

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.395
I am a merchant, so...

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:51.561
... I thought of a new delivery
that should arrive today.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:54.268
And a meeting with a new customer.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:59.527
Then I remembered that my cousin
insisted that I listen to you!

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:01.570
A good list,...

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.576
... especially the last point.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:06.746
If you imagine yourself,
on your deathbed,...

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:10.330
... how would this day appear to you?

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.412
I think,...

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:18.917
... I would rather have visited my old
mother before I go into business.

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:24.256
Or spent more time with my son.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:28.765
How do you feel about
these new thoughts?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.478
It feels right!

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.524
How should I express it?

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.573
I would not have to do anything else...

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:45.319
... I would choose these things.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.162
You do not have to do anything else!

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.910
What is it that we really
need to do in life?

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:56.087
We care so much about the
duties of the day,...

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:59.254
... we try to make it right
for the world around us...

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:05.514
... and in the end see
only a series of busy,...

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.885
... but meaningless days.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:12.600
We are ships that sail for years but
never reach their destination,...

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.140
... because we have no goal in mind.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.439
There is no map
that we can follow.

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:22.156
I call this card Life
on the First Principle.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:26.118
God created us to love us.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.279
And, so that we love him.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:33.291
If that's true, then our
life is best used...

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:38.377
... we use our time
to pay homage to God.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:43.135
Everything in this world exists
solely for this purpose.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.015
Wealth, knowledge, skills,...

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.970
... dreams and longings.

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:54.813
Even sickness and misfortune can
bring us closer to his love.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.481
So,...

01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:01.395
... do not pray every day
for good to happen to you.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.153
Pray that you may come closer to God.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.494
Whatever you do, do
it in your honor.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.166
Then you live a good life.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.287
Make sure she gets the food.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.546
A good sermon.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.420
Forgive me, father.

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.505
It was just a conversation among friends.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.261
The best sermon I've
heard in years!

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:32.601
Even from my own lips.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:35.062
Do you belong to a medal?

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.978
No, we are just simple men.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:40.983
Understand. And the right clothes?

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.399
A sign of our community.

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:46.156
And you are not afraid,
someone might think...

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.526
... you would preach
like ordained priests?

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.825
That's not our intention.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:54.786
Capitan Loyola!

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.713
It is you, is not it?

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.382
No more!

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.259
I understand.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.091
You try a new face.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:12.345
I want to escape my old face.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.805
A question:

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:21.018
Could you hear God's voice,
learn to hear it,...

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.936
... would you keep that secret?

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:28.357
How can you be sure that God
is speaking through you?

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:32.277
I wrote everything down.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:36.831
It describes a time
away from the world.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.544
I meditated on the life of the Lord.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.711
I imagined myself in the
stations of his life,...

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.338
... or kneeling before God's throne.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:54.176
I have to ask this! This way of
praying, this imagination,...

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:58.145
... it sounds very much like the methods
of the Alumbrados, the Illuminati!

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.601
You are not one of them, are you?

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.813
The Alumbrados are not
true thinkers, father.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.477
You are careless.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:07.733
My method is thorough.

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:12.985
I would like to continue this conversation.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:16.993
Maybe you will come to
my monastery for dinner.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.701
Some of the Dominican scholars
would certainly like to meet you.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.537
So you are a preacher?

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.622
What are you preaching?

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.591
No, father.
I am not a preacher.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:32.304
- It's just simple conversations...
- Simple conversations, yes.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:34.590
Sanchez told me about it.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:36.971
But I do not believe you!

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.228
And I can not respect you.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:43.606
If you want to preach, preach!

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.318
The gentlemen are violated by the gentleman.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.567
So, let's call it 'preaching'!

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.445
What are you preaching?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.320
Nothing that would be foreign to you, father.

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:59.121
Virtues and vices.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.709
- love and hate for each other...
- It's so simple!

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:06.672
Even children love
virtue and hate vice.

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:09.632
So why do you have to preach about it?

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.174
It's easy if we can make
a clear distinction.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:15.844
But many decisions
are not clear.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:19.802
Like the choice of marrying
or becoming a priest.

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:24.648
- Brother Ignatius has a way of stopping...
- A way of prayer,...

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.649
... to know God's will.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:30.233
It's about your own
experiences and feelings,...

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.780
... about what moves your soul.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.993
These efforts seem strange,...

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:39.280
... unnecessary, maybe even dangerous!

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:42.874
For centuries Mother Church
is doing a good job.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:46.044
We do not need radical experiments!

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.630
My method has saved lives.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.087
Starting with my own!

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.802
Many liars have already said that.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:58.014
I do not say more.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.723
You will!
I think you will!

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:08.272
If you really believe that your new
method is of value to the Church,...

01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:13.322
... you will not
resist a scrutiny.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:17.867
- Not true?
- She is not ready yet to be revealed.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.706
Nevertheless, she is ready to be
recited to simple Christians...

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:28.125
... and exposing them to
wrong and maybe damnation!

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.672
My method is impeccable.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.633
But nevertheless I have to reject!

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.962
I did not say that
you have a choice!

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:41.976
You remain in our custody
until the tribunal arrives.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:46.563
- Tribunal?
- Inquisitor Frias is a friend of ours.

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:49.399
He will take good care of you!

01:15:09.213 --> 01:15:10.704
<i>Ignatius!</i>

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:15.550
Ignatius!

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.214
Calixto?

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.594
What are you doing here?

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:24.509
I have asked myself.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:26.895
- We all!
- What?

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.440
We did not want you
to suffer alone.

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.234
But... the people?

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.733
Who should take care of her?

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:38.398
They're gone, Ignatius.

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:41.785
<i>You heard what happened to you.</i>

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.779
<i>They got scared.</i>

01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:45.997
After all our work!

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.374
And nobody stayed!

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:52.208
It is easy to keep faith
when things are good.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:57.467
Only one returned to
Christ to thank Him.

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:00.337
You have at least three!

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:03.932
We'll get through this, brother.

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:06.977
We stand by your side
until the end comes.

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:10.143
Let us pray that
this is not the end.

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.702
Father Sanchez!

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:27.455
Do you want to invite me to dinner again?

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.707
I apologize for what happened.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.917
That was not my intention.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.583
You would not have had to go
the distance for an apology!

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.331
A letter would have been enough.

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.421
You are a busy man!

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:44.848
I am to defend you before the tribunal.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:51.180
So it's up to you
that I confess?

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:58.605
I understand that the Inquisition may now
confiscate the property of the guilty party.

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:03.324
You can have everything!

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.659
My entire fortune!

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.663
Let's stay with that, Ignatius.

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:15.170
Frias is a strict man!

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:18.632
He burned more
suspicious alumbrados...

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:21.881
... as any prosecutor in
Spain, even the whole church.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.920
I know death!

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.214
I'm not afraid!

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.431
Your companions may
not be so brave.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:33.268
Your punishment will be hers!

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:39.899
If you do not want to save,
maybe you want to save her!

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:43.941
What is your plan?

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.329
We have to do two things:

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:53.204
We have to present your writings.
How should we call her?

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:54.584
Spiritual exercises!

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.294
Good, your spiritual exercises.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:18:01.254
<i>We have to prove that they are from
Scripture and divine inspiration alone.</i>

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:09.140
We also need as many
witnesses as possible...

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:11.601
<i>... that testify to your good character.</i>

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.656
I am Doña Ines Pascual.

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.670
I am Agustin Crisostomo.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:41.589
I am the doctor in the hospital of Manresa.

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:46.633
I am Jeronimo Ardevol, the director
of the University of Barcelona.

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:49.882
I am Doctor Ciruelo.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.686
I speak for two noble ladies.

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.897
A mother and a daughter.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.688
They were entrusted to my care.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:03.646
Almost every day I saw Ignatius,...

01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:06.652
... he took care of the
sick and fed them.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:11.867
Once he put his finger
on a man's wound.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:15.331
<i>Then he put his finger
to his own lips.</i>

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:19.582
Ignatius came to me after he
returned from Jerusalem.

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:25.463
He wanted to continue the training that had
denied him his career in the military.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:30.055
<i>It was strange to
see a man of 33,...</i>

01:19:30.224 --> 01:19:33.262
... read the books for 13-year-olds.

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:38.309
Seven, eight hours he spent on
his knees, without sleep,...

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:39.890
...to pray.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:43.944
His penance, his fasting,
sleep deprivation,...

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:45.900
... made him sick.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.152
We had to take care of him.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:49.858
Of course I was shocked!

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.402
<i>I asked him what he did!</i>

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:56.449
<i>He said that he felt sick,...</i>

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.242
... by the severe smell
of the man's wound.

01:20:00.087 --> 01:20:06.584
So he forced himself to become one
with the stink and dirt of the farmer.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.881
So we are one and the same!

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.262
A stubborn man.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:14.258
But also very humble.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.809
He endured the embarrassment.

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:19.766
<i>And he worked.</i>

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:26.062
Without education, he was convinced he
could not convince his companions...

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.029
... and lead them to the light.

01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:35.662
I learned that they went to secret
meetings organized by a certain Ignatius...

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.281
... together with his companions.

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.874
He never spoke alone with one of the ladies.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.664
There was always someone there.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:44.166
They claimed to have visions.

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:47.458
As if Christ were speaking
to them from the Cross.

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:52.300
<i>For a week they listened to
the charlatan's sermons,...</i>

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:56.178
<i>... then my wards decided
to go on pilgrimage.</i>

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:57.804
<i>On foot!</i>

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:00.015
A strange man,...

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:02.267
... with strange habits.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:05.141
But his dedication can
not be denied him.

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:08.024
He was very welcome
in my hospital.

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.779
I know this man.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.990
He is a good man!

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.027
Words should be his new weapon.

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:19.114
And he wanted to master her.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:24.749
For this man speaks the devil!

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:28.919
For the sake of our wives,...

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.380
... he must be silenced!

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:33.970
These meetings...?

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:40.681
Your followers speak of 'spiritual
exercises'. What is this exactly?

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:44.310
The idea behind it is simple.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.608
Man was created to know God.

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:49.606
He should do God's glory.

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:51.730
He should reciprocate
his inexhaustible love.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:55.116
If this is our purpose,...

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.986
... then brings us everything
that brings us closer to God,...

01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:00.204
... inner peace and happiness.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:03.041
I call that 'comfort'.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:06.536
Whatever separates us from God...

01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:10.082
... creates suffering, pain and emptiness.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.088
That's what I call 'desolation'.

01:22:13.554 --> 01:22:18.549
The spiritual exercises let us
know the motives of the soul.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:20.471
We recognize who come from God...

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:22.135
... and which come from the enemy.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:26.473
Why do you need another
method to hear God's Word...

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:30.352
... if it is clear in the Bible?

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:32.278
The bids are clear!

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:35.862
The exercises are not about simple
questions and obvious answers.

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:41.455
You have to practice them constantly,
guided by a spiritual leader.

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.916
You learn to be quiet,...

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.664
... to listen and to obey.

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:52.465
How many years have you
devoted to teaching?

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:55.298
Two years of undergraduate studies in Barcelona,...

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:58.755
... one year in Alcala, to
start now in Salamanca.

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:02.221
How many years of theology?

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:05.394
- Less than a year.
- Oh!

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:11.394
Yet do you preach a very complex
and detailed form of prayer?

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:15.109
The method comes from my own
experiences and my judgment.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:18.821
She gave comfort to many people
and showed them the way.

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:20.493
I'm sure.

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.621
There is a simple explanation,...

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.783
... for all the peculiarities
that surround the defendant.

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:30.420
This man belongs to the Alumbrados!

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.671
An Illuminat!

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:37.089
Blasphemers who think they are
inspired directly by God!

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:38.928
They say they hear his voice.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:42.553
Supposedly they give themselves
completely to the divine,...

01:23:42.726 --> 01:23:45.719
... and thus are free of all sin.

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:48.809
Who knows me, Your
Honor, who knows...

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:51.774
... that I am the last one who
claims to be free from sin!

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:57.398
But how can an uneducated person speak
so freely about the motives of the soul?

01:23:57.574 --> 01:24:02.160
Gentlemen, I gave you
all my writings.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:06.410
Do you see something that
contradicts the teaching,...

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.366
... so I will correct that immediately!

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:14.089
We have found nothing in the Scriptures
that is against the teaching.

01:24:14.758 --> 01:24:17.626
Otherwise you would have been burned long ago.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:21.763
As you would burn, you would
have been guilty of heresy.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:27.678
The church has to take exams.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.313
Heresy is omnipresent.

01:24:30.691 --> 01:24:35.811
I say that the scholars of the Church
should examine these exercises...

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:38.358
... before you can spread it!

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.740
With all saints!

01:24:42.286 --> 01:24:43.652
I implore you!

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:48.782
Do not let me wait for decades until
all theologians of Rome agree!

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:51.576
There is a war raging.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:55.627
He is as dreadful and real as
he is against every tyrant.

01:24:56.341 --> 01:25:00.085
God's children can no
longer see, no longer hear.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:04.298
They do not feel like they
are sliding into the abyss.

01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:07.392
That's why I wrote that.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.846
This is a manual for the war.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:15.813
It shows us the fight and allows us
to hear the voice of our commander.

01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:21.606
No! I can not stop preaching
what I have learned!

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:25.110
We are God's army!

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:29.740
Can I just lead another soldier
into the ranks of my master...

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:34.040
... I accept the punishment
of this Tribunal for it!

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:41.631
God should be the supreme
judge of our souls.

01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:46.343
Your companions mentioned a journal,...

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:49.093
... that you have led from
Loyola since your departure.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.935
We have all your scriptures for
your spiritual exercises,...

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:55.898
... but not the diary.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.601
Why?

01:25:57.903 --> 01:26:02.648
Because it contains the
source of your abominations?

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.153
Certainly not!

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:06.946
Why do you hold it back then?

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:09.995
Let the tribunal see everything...

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:13.241
... so that Mother can judge
the church as a whole!

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:17.579
Sir, you write it
yourself in this book:

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:21.374
"A spirit, in light and openness, is good.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:25.303
A mind surrounded by secrets
and deception is evil. "

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:29.048
What spirit is in you
right now, Brother Ignatius?

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:37.181
Well.

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:41.611
The hearing will be postponed until tomorrow morning...

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:45.566
... so that these Illuminati
can rethink their statements.

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:51.824
You hid it from me.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.499
It is an important piece of
evidence for the Inquisition!

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:57.626
Where is the diary?

01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.670
It will not help us.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.793
You know what this
advice is capable of!

01:27:02.008 --> 01:27:04.000
Do you really want to die?

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:08.592
Well.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.265
Tomorrow you will seal your destiny!

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.754
<i>"My dear knight,...</i>

01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:47.801
<i>... nobody will ever know this.</i>

01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:50.004
<i>Nobody will remember.</i>

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.305
<i>Only we.</i>

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.431
<i>I learned what happened
in Salamanca,...</i>

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:59.355
<i>... from my friend, your
sister, Doña Magdalena.</i>

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:02.729
<i>I was dismayed to hear about
your injury in Pamplona.</i>

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:06.608
<i>But I hear you are now
living a new life.</i>

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:09.528
<i>And your heart is fulfilled.</i>

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:14.329
<i>I have to tell you, on the
night we met in Valladolid,...</i>

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:16.410
<i>... I searched for the library,...</i>

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:19.409
<i>... to throw me out of the window.</i>

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.207
<i>I wanted to put an end to my suffering.</i>

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:26.628
<i>All the years of imprisonment and
mistreatment by my mother,...</i>

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.794
<i>... my young soul could
not take it anymore.</i>

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.672
<i>I wanted to put a quick end to it.</i>

01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:38.978
<i>But instead of death, I met a
man, with passion and fire.</i>

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:20.321
<i>Fast! Fast!
Help delete!</i>

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:24.124
<i>Right this way!</i>

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.829
<i>Go get it all!
Come!</i>

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:34.169
<i>Stay in your cell! Come on!</i>

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:38.423
Ignatius!

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.471
- Yes?
- Everyone flees!

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:46.101
- Yes.
- Everyone, only we do not!

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:48.728
Everyone, only we do not...

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:05.328
Good morning, father.

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:07.001
You are still here.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.669
Naturally.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:11.126
The prisoners, they...

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.508
- They are all gone.
- I have heard that.

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:17.302
You did not try to go with them?

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:18.966
How many escaped?

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.682
26th

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:24.643
How many got caught?

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:26.224
12th

01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:28.893
I do not want to be the thirteenth

01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:31.892
And the missing diary?

01:31:34.364 --> 01:31:36.526
I tell you where it is.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:45.706
<i>For a simple reason, I hid
these pages from Frias.</i>

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:50.661
There is more than
enough in it to show...

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:52.918
... if the Tribunal only wishes,...

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:55.958
... that I am a madman.

01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:59.966
<i>I do not want people
to doubt my teachings.</i>

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:05.218
Because the exercises that helped
them demanded such a high price.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:09.059
<i>But I have realized that
it is no longer with me.</i>

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:11.936
God will guide your spirit...

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:16.195
... and you realize that my
pain, my gift, was worth it...

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:20.153
... or he lets the
tribunal silence me.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.908
Either way, I'll bend over.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:32.370
<i>Today: the whip and fasting.</i>

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:36.298
<i>And then again...
the whip!</i>

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.464
<i>That's the only thing I can think about.</i>

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:42.972
<i>How much pain do I have to endure...</i>

01:32:43.183 --> 01:32:46.017
<i>... to atone for my sins?</i>

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:49.265
Shame!

01:32:49.439 --> 01:32:52.147
<i>I worthless sinner!</i>

01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:56.143
<i>I am ashamed of God,...</i>

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:59.280
<i>... because I cheated
on his holy name.</i>

01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:01.532
<i>How wretched I am!</i>

01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:03.692
<i>Like a worm, like a maggot,...</i>

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:07.747
<i>... in the face of the most beautiful being.</i>

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:10.075
Go back with my sins!

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:17.415
<i>Your journey started well...</i>

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:24.509
... right, Ignatius?

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.143
<i>So much fire in you, right?</i>

01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:32.646
<i>No one is asking
you to be a hero!</i>

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:35.274
<i>That flash in your eyes!</i>

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:38.185
And your miserable
efforts in the hospital!

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.687
<i>How strange.</i>

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:42.736
<i>The great saint.</i>

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:46.243
<i>A servant of God.</i>

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.076
The born again Francis.

01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:53.914
<i>How must the beggar have
praised your generosity!</i>

01:33:56.089 --> 01:34:01.460
<i>How much you wanted to do justice
to your role in this piece!</i>

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:04.887
<i>Your own Amadis de Gaula.</i>

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:12.929
The glittering knight, the
bloodiest sword of the empire...

01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:17.441
<i>... to the pure Queen of Heaven.</i>

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:24.027
Ignatius of Loyola, loyal
soldier of Castile.

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:27.735
How many did you murder?

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:31.076
<i>You will never be a hero.</i>

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:33.874
<i>Killer. You killed.</i>

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:37.203
<i>The darkness is waiting for you.</i>

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.998
Not only your enemies,...

01:34:40.466 --> 01:34:42.378
... also your brothers in arms!

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:46.508
You betrayed your brothers in arms.

01:34:47.307 --> 01:34:48.423
Cheated!

01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:51.930
Are their eyes saying that
they are thinking of glory?

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.311
<i>- You fool!
- You miserable coward...</i>

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:58.103
<i>Could not you have
saved their lives?</i>

01:34:59.569 --> 01:35:02.277
You could have saved her!

01:35:02.488 --> 01:35:08.450
But you... wanted... to die!

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:17.293
<i>Consider who you are!
Remember your past!</i>

01:35:17.503 --> 01:35:20.837
Think of your nature,
your destiny!

01:35:25.678 --> 01:35:29.968
Are you strong enough to endure
the 70 years of suffering,...

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:33.430
... that your god has planned for you?

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:37.103
<i>I see the darkness.
She comes closer.</i>

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:39.356
<i>She surrounds me.
What should I do?</i>

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.354
<i>I am too weak...</i>

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:59.577
<i>I am too weak.
I can not see the light.</i>

01:35:59.837 --> 01:36:02.045
<i>I am a creature of this world.</i>

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:05.294
<i>I am a sinner.</i>

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:09.378
<i>I can not take it anymore.</i>

01:36:11.391 --> 01:36:16.762
<i>Where is the light after I search?</i>

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.269
<i>The light!</i>

01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:21.724
<i>Kill me!
So somebody kill me!</i>

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:25.190
<i>Only my death brings justice.</i>

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:30.241
<i>I do not have the strength
to survive this...</i>

01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:35.121
<i>Why did not I die on this wall?</i>

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:38.499
<i>I'm not enough.
You will never honor my name.</i>

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:42.920
<i>I can not anymore!
I am a coward!</i>

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:45.999
<i>Coward!
On this wall...</i>

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.992
Someone like you, has no choice!

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:27.126
You can not erase the past.

01:37:27.467 --> 01:37:30.756
Your future is decided!

01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:34.839
You will die as a sinner, Ignatius.

01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:37.971
You can be sure of that!

01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:47.602
You will die, and you will burn!

01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:52.357
What you do from now on to
the fire does not matter.

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:56.823
So why wait?

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:08.081
<i>Ignatius! Spring!
It's just a step...</i>

01:38:10.259 --> 01:38:14.173
Exactly! That's better!

01:38:14.764 --> 01:38:18.132
You can never
soothe God's wrath.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:20.176
Face it!

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:24.059
Go ahead, like a true knight.

01:38:24.273 --> 01:38:28.813
<i>Find the light!
Find the light in you. Go </i>!

01:38:29.112 --> 01:38:32.025
<i>Do not listen to him,
go into the light!</i>

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.654
<i>It is there.
The light was always there.</i>

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:39.779
<i>He was always with you,
he never left you.</i>

01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:43.911
<i>Listen to the light in you!</i>

01:38:44.168 --> 01:38:48.208
<i>He always loved you.
The light was always with you!</i>

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:53.254
<i>Get up!
Get up! </i>!

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:06.272
Remember, son!
We are men from Loyola.

01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:10.859
We never lower our eyes.

01:39:18.202 --> 01:39:22.788
And now,...
stand up!

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:39.137
<i>Get up!
Get up! </i>!

01:39:41.017 --> 01:39:45.478
Go on, knight of
the morning star.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:49.223
Meet your destiny!

01:39:50.067 --> 01:39:53.356
Knight of the morning star...

01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:59.737
The morning star!

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:03.487
Lucifer!

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:10.707
Miserable creature!

01:40:14.717 --> 01:40:17.926
Now I know your voice!

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:23.390
Now I know your lies!

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:31.015
You can not promise
me an hour of life.

01:40:31.734 --> 01:40:34.852
I will not insult my master!

01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:39.858
I will not end the
life I promised him.

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:45.325
And now, voice of the fallen,...

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:48.282
... keep silent!

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:51.752
Henceforth!

01:42:05.745 --> 01:42:08.829
<i>Once I asked a man
to break my leg,...</i>

01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:12.741
<i>... so that it could heal
and grow together again.</i>

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:24.754
<i>For that very reason, God
had to break my spirit.</i>

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:35.648
<i>Fortunately, God is a
better surgeon than man.</i>

01:42:39.445 --> 01:42:43.280
<i>If you miss the death penalty,...</i>

01:42:43.699 --> 01:42:49.161
<i>... suddenly life looks completely different.</i>

01:43:00.591 --> 01:43:03.709
You know, we were
both called that.

01:43:06.972 --> 01:43:10.556
The creature you
defeated, and I,...

01:43:11.477 --> 01:43:15.391
Both were called
'The Morning Star'.

01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:23.775
But now you know the difference.

01:43:24.532 --> 01:43:26.990
Now you know my voice.

01:43:29.578 --> 01:43:31.945
Sir!

01:43:33.916 --> 01:43:35.999
<i>Arise, my friend.</i>

01:43:36.419 --> 01:43:38.911
I'm ashamed to stand
before you, sir.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.292
<i>Why?</i>

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:44.048
Because I am a sinner!

01:43:44.635 --> 01:43:46.843
<i>What significance does that have for you?</i>

01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:49.217
I have insulted you.

01:43:49.724 --> 01:43:51.761
I hurt you.

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:54.931
<i>Hurt me?
Why are you saying that?</i>

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:58.055
My shameful sins, Lord!

01:44:00.359 --> 01:44:05.855
When you grow up, it's my
sins that crucify you.

01:44:06.282 --> 01:44:09.775
<i>Do you think your sins
have power over me...</i>

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:13.241
<i>... if I do not allow it?</i>

01:44:36.896 --> 01:44:39.980
<i>Now look the world with new eyes!</i>

01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:43.395
<i>Tell me what you see.</i>

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:52.864
<i>I see all the things in the
world that were created for me.</i>

01:44:54.163 --> 01:44:56.997
<i>All the things
that nourished me.</i>

01:45:00.753 --> 01:45:03.746
<i>All the things that
gave me strength.</i>

01:45:08.302 --> 01:45:12.216
<i>All the tests, all the tears.</i>

01:45:18.395 --> 01:45:20.603
<i>All of this...</i>

01:45:21.857 --> 01:45:24.065
<i>... brought me to you!</i>

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:28.900
<i>Remember, my soldier:</i>

01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:33.825
I loved you first!

01:45:43.212 --> 01:45:47.126
Take, sir!
Take my freedom,...

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:53.504
... my mind, my
memories, all my will!

01:45:56.892 --> 01:45:59.509
What I have you gave me!

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:01.895
And I want to give it to you.

01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:04.518
Have it.

01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:08.651
Give me your grace, your love.

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:15.484
That should be enough
for me to live!

01:46:43.439 --> 01:46:47.058
Your story is captivating, Loyola.

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:51.945
But your method is too alien
to unquestionably permit it.

01:46:52.907 --> 01:46:55.115
I still want to silence you.

01:46:55.868 --> 01:46:58.360
Tell me why I should
not burn you!

01:47:11.425 --> 01:47:16.386
Once I dreamed about these
wolves and the cauldron.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.302
It was winter.

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:24.178
An old and a young wolf starved to death.

01:47:24.855 --> 01:47:26.938
And they came to our castle.

01:47:27.191 --> 01:47:30.309
A cauldron full of food was
left from the ramparts.

01:47:31.153 --> 01:47:35.067
One after the other tried
to eat from the cauldron.

01:47:35.616 --> 01:47:39.030
But he swung back and forth.

01:47:39.912 --> 01:47:45.283
The wolves had to work together,
each standing on one side,...

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:47.955
... so that they could finally eat.

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:52.164
We are a church of contrasts:

01:47:52.591 --> 01:47:54.833
Acting and thinking.

01:47:55.094 --> 01:47:57.552
Passion and humility.

01:47:58.263 --> 01:48:00.846
Fire and water.

01:48:02.643 --> 01:48:04.885
Father Frias, we
are not enemies!

01:48:05.771 --> 01:48:09.264
We form the balance that
is for God's glory.

01:48:18.242 --> 01:48:25.035
In Pamplona, the soldier Ignatius had
his troops fight a losing battle.

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:28.033
The castle wall was broken,...

01:48:28.377 --> 01:48:30.414
... the enemy marched towards them.

01:48:30.796 --> 01:48:35.040
He decided to jump
into the breach,...

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:38.380
... to ward off the invaders.

01:48:39.722 --> 01:48:42.305
Many would think this madness.

01:48:42.766 --> 01:48:47.056
A reasonable man would
inevitably surrender.

01:48:47.646 --> 01:48:51.390
But he is not a sensible man!

01:48:52.026 --> 01:48:54.484
He does not choose bravery.

01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:59.865
But solid principles and his
teachings are well founded.

01:49:00.993 --> 01:49:05.738
Unconventional, unknown and
new, but well thought out.

01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:09.036
Was not St. Francis
too unconventional?

01:49:09.209 --> 01:49:11.075
Was not Saint Dominic new?

01:49:11.086 --> 01:49:16.627
Was not Christ himself radical and
completely alien to the Sanhedrin?

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:18.875
Gentlemen,...

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:22.341
... the church ramparts were broken.

01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:24.347
It is a time of reckoning.

01:49:24.516 --> 01:49:27.930
It comes to light, which
happens in secret.

01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:33.394
If this man is a heretic because
he wants to make us better...

01:49:34.276 --> 01:49:37.019
... we can not judge him for that.

01:49:38.113 --> 01:49:40.275
Always the church took damage,...

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.442
... but the church lives.

01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:47.703
To survive, we must
learn to listen.

01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:50.122
People like him.

01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:55.795
People who stand at the front and
courageously advance the Church.

01:49:58.550 --> 01:50:00.758
At Ezekiel, God said:

01:50:01.136 --> 01:50:04.049
"They exploit the weak and the poor.

01:50:04.598 --> 01:50:08.217
So I sought among them a
man who builds a wall,...

01:50:08.519 --> 01:50:10.681
... or for the country jumps
in the breach and meets me,...

01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:13.187
... so that I do not have to destroy it.
But I did not find any! "

01:50:16.068 --> 01:50:18.310
That's what this man does.

01:50:23.742 --> 01:50:26.701
He is in the breach.

01:50:27.746 --> 01:50:30.329
And he is fighting.

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:44.795
What shoud that?

01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:49.720
I was asked to hold a
Mass for Brother Ignatius.

01:50:50.269 --> 01:50:54.764
Incredible! I have never
seen such a full church.

01:51:37.566 --> 01:51:40.479
Defendant, rise!

01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:44.654
Ignatius López de Oñaz y Loyola,...

01:51:45.157 --> 01:51:48.446
... after careful consideration,...

01:51:48.785 --> 01:51:51.573
... you have the following verdict:

01:51:53.123 --> 01:51:55.831
As for the charge of
heresy and blasphemy,...

01:51:56.126 --> 01:52:01.087
... so the Tribunal has carefully
checked your methods for errors.

01:52:01.715 --> 01:52:03.297
But we did not find any.

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:05.500
You are innocent!

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:12.303
However, as far as preaching
without permission,...

01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:15.138
... the tribunal holds
back its verdict.

01:52:15.729 --> 01:52:20.849
You and your companions are strictly
forbidden to preach in public.

01:52:21.777 --> 01:52:23.393
Except for children.

01:52:23.737 --> 01:52:27.822
However, only the simple
truths of the teaching.

01:52:28.951 --> 01:52:31.284
The session is closed.

01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:42.287
- Ignatius!
- Father Sanchez!

01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:44.380
Thank you for your help!

01:52:44.841 --> 01:52:47.128
You saved us from the stake.

01:52:47.302 --> 01:52:48.509
But your work...

01:52:48.762 --> 01:52:52.096
The judgment completely
forbids you to preach.

01:52:52.808 --> 01:52:54.674
I listen and obey.

01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:56.968
Brother Ignatius!

01:52:57.813 --> 01:52:58.929
Yes, your honor?

01:52:59.231 --> 01:53:02.224
I would have some advice
for you, if you wish.

01:53:02.484 --> 01:53:04.350
Of course, your honor!

01:53:05.237 --> 01:53:11.825
The judgment of the tribunal
is valid only in Salamanca.

01:53:12.536 --> 01:53:17.497
You can continue
your work elsewhere.

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:21.371
But before finishing your studies,...

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:26.293
... so that nobody can doubt
your education anymore.

01:53:26.883 --> 01:53:31.969
- But I...
- But, studying costs money.

01:53:33.515 --> 01:53:36.679
I think I can help
you on this point.

01:53:37.853 --> 01:53:43.690
Give this letter to the director of
the Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris.

01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:47.477
He will tell you
what to do next.

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.104
Do not worry!

01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:52.569
Everything will be fine.

01:53:53.076 --> 01:53:55.659
I am honored, sir.

01:53:56.038 --> 01:53:58.121
But I do not think
I deserve that.

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:04.039
- There is certainly a better candidate...
- We have enough scholars and poets!

01:54:04.755 --> 01:54:09.796
Maybe the church needs
the spirit of a soldier.

01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:15.421
After all, we are called the
'champion of the church'.

01:54:17.726 --> 01:54:21.060
- Paris!
- I request you, suppose!

01:54:21.646 --> 01:54:25.060
My first year at a university.
At 33 years!

01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:28.143
"A prophet is never
welcome in his homeland!"

01:54:28.403 --> 01:54:31.191
Not even crippled
dreamer, I suppose.

01:54:33.825 --> 01:54:38.069
The French I owe my limp,
but it brought me to God.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:41.952
Maybe the French can do
something with my head.

01:54:58.975 --> 01:55:00.341
Ignatius!

01:55:05.774 --> 01:55:08.312
Doña Ines sends these supplies.

01:55:09.403 --> 01:55:11.110
And this letter of credit.

01:55:11.488 --> 01:55:14.231
You should remember to eat!

01:55:16.785 --> 01:55:19.368
Give her my deepest thanks.

01:55:20.789 --> 01:55:24.783
I will obey her as I
have done before!

01:55:28.046 --> 01:55:30.413
Well then, Calixto,...

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:33.503
... your last chance!

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:37.132
Do not you really want to come?

01:55:38.682 --> 01:55:40.674
My place is here.

01:55:41.226 --> 01:55:43.809
Your wisdom and love
will be missed.

01:55:44.062 --> 01:55:46.805
But there is much to do in Spain.

01:55:57.367 --> 01:55:58.903
Come, brothers!

01:55:59.453 --> 01:56:01.240
Come!

01:56:02.038 --> 01:56:04.030
Let's pray for our friend.

01:56:09.171 --> 01:56:11.663
The Lord give you a safe journey,...

01:56:12.007 --> 01:56:14.420
... in all ways that
lie before you.

01:56:29.608 --> 01:56:32.146
<i>May you find companions,...</i>

01:56:32.903 --> 01:56:35.646
<i>... that are worthy of your dreams.</i>

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:40.775
<i>May your plans be bold...</i>

01:56:42.078 --> 01:56:45.617
<i>... and your courage
enough to fulfill them.</i>

01:56:48.418 --> 01:56:51.536
<i>Live and spread God's love,...</i>

01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:55.002
<i>... to every corner of the world,...</i>

01:56:58.637 --> 01:57:02.096
<i>... to the extreme
limits of his church.</i>

01:57:18.490 --> 01:57:22.074
<i>May your passion always
burn brilliantly!</i>

01:57:22.786 --> 01:57:28.623
<i>And ignite the fires of the
world, in the name of God.</i>

01:57:32.003 --> 01:57:38.842
In 1540 Ignatius and his companions
founded the Order of the Jesuits.

01:57:39.636 --> 01:57:44.472
They swore to go where the
Holy Father requested.

01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:49.769
As the 'vanguard of the church'
The Jesuits wrote history.

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:58.862
In 1622 Ignatius was
canonized by Loyola.

01:57:59.489 --> 01:58:03.779
IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA -
FIGHTERS, SINNERS, SAINTS
